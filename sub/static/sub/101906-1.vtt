WEBVTT

00:47.560 --> 00:49.227
<i>Can you go slower?</i>

00:50.227 --> 00:51.810
<i>Yeah, sorry.</i>

00:55.185 --> 00:57.102
Can I have the water bottle?

00:57.185 --> 00:58.643
Yeah.

01:04.852 --> 01:07.018
It's called a bidon.

01:08.143 --> 01:09.893
What's in it?

01:09.977 --> 01:11.601
Orangina.

01:14.935 --> 01:16.935
- Thanks.
- No problem.

01:17.018 --> 01:18.476
No, thanks for this.

01:18.560 --> 01:22.227
For getting me out here.
I never would have thought of doing this.

01:22.310 --> 01:24.935
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

01:26.185 --> 01:29.810
And I kind of need it
because I've been getting fat.

01:29.893 --> 01:33.643
Yeah. Most people get in shape
before their wedding.

01:33.726 --> 01:34.810
Yeah.

01:34.893 --> 01:36.768
I... I didn't do that.

01:36.852 --> 01:41.601
Yeah. Hey, when we hit the hill up here,
try to keep, like, a steady cadence.

01:41.685 --> 01:42.852
What's a cadence?

01:42.935 --> 01:46.518
Your pedal cadence,
it's the rhythm of your feet as they move.

01:46.601 --> 01:49.518
- You want to keep them consistently moving.
- All right.

01:50.518 --> 01:53.351
So you're, like, really into this.

01:53.434 --> 01:54.476
Cycling?

01:54.560 --> 01:57.768
- Yeah.
- Yeah. It's like... I love it.

01:57.852 --> 02:00.310
You know, it's beautiful, you sweat a lot.

02:00.393 --> 02:02.685
Helps me clear my head when, you know...

02:03.685 --> 02:08.144
Maybe when I get back home,
I can get a bike and we can do it together.

02:08.227 --> 02:11.018
This could be, like, our thing.

02:11.102 --> 02:14.310
- Yeah. That'd be cool.
- Cool.

02:15.810 --> 02:18.144
Mike, I'm getting married.
How awesome is that?

02:19.185 --> 02:20.310
Awesome.

02:21.351 --> 02:22.643
She's the best.

02:22.726 --> 02:25.018
She's like the best person ever.

02:26.518 --> 02:28.893
I don't have to change to be with her,
you know?

02:28.977 --> 02:32.768
Remember how Marissa made me get
that Rob Thomas haircut

02:32.852 --> 02:35.601
and Tina made me be an atheist for a year?

02:35.685 --> 02:37.601
- Yeah, I remember that.
- Yeah.

02:37.685 --> 02:39.227
Ava isn't like that.

02:40.269 --> 02:42.685
She loves me for who I am.

02:42.768 --> 02:45.977
And I love her for who she is.

02:46.060 --> 02:48.810
And I can't wait to spend
the rest of my life with her.

02:48.893 --> 02:50.601
Kyle, I slept with Ava.

02:51.643 --> 02:52.810
What?

02:52.893 --> 02:54.977
What do you mean "slept"?

02:55.060 --> 02:58.018
Like, we sexually slept together.

02:58.102 --> 02:59.518
Shit.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.060
All right.

03:04.018 --> 03:05.144
Oh, my God.

03:05.227 --> 03:07.309
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

03:08.810 --> 03:11.144
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

03:11.227 --> 03:12.768
Now, when?

03:13.810 --> 03:16.185
When did you sleep together?

03:16.268 --> 03:19.351
- I don't know the exact dates. I didn't...
- Dates?!

03:19.435 --> 03:21.935
Dude, slow down, you should pace yourself.

03:25.309 --> 03:27.560
- How long?
- Like a quarter mile.

03:27.643 --> 03:30.685
No, how long has this been going on?

03:30.768 --> 03:32.893
When did it start?!

03:32.977 --> 03:34.977
When she moved to New York.

03:35.060 --> 03:36.476
Three years ago!

03:36.560 --> 03:38.810
This whole fucking time?!

03:38.893 --> 03:40.102
No.

03:40.185 --> 03:42.852
No, not the whole time. It was... You know.

03:43.935 --> 03:46.393
It was before you guys started dating.

04:30.476 --> 04:32.060
Okay.

04:33.351 --> 04:34.268
Okay, Mike.

04:35.310 --> 04:37.184
You guys slept together.

04:38.226 --> 04:40.019
It happened.

04:42.268 --> 04:44.060
It's in the past.

04:45.476 --> 04:46.893
It also happened in the present.

04:47.935 --> 04:49.852
Fuck, Mike!

04:50.977 --> 04:53.810
Switch gears, you need to pedal
at a higher cadence.

04:53.893 --> 04:55.518
Fuck you, Mike.

04:56.768 --> 05:00.310
You're like... You're like a real-life Judas.

05:02.060 --> 05:05.560
On the plus side, that makes you like Jesus,
so that's like a...

05:05.643 --> 05:06.852
Is that a joke?

05:06.935 --> 05:08.602
Are you making a joke?

05:08.685 --> 05:10.226
You're right.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.310
It was in bad taste.

05:15.476 --> 05:18.268
- Kyle, what do you want me to say?
- "I'm sorry"?

05:21.184 --> 05:23.810
I didn't plan this, it sort of just like...

05:24.852 --> 05:25.810
It happened. I don't know.

05:25.893 --> 05:28.810
There's something about her,
like she's smart and she's interesting

05:28.893 --> 05:31.060
and she does this thing with her hips
that I've never...

05:31.143 --> 05:32.393
The hip thing?

05:32.476 --> 05:35.768
She's my fiancÃ©e.
You think I don't know about the hip thing?

05:35.852 --> 05:37.727
You're right. I'm sorry.

05:37.810 --> 05:40.102
If I catch you, I'm gonna kill you.

05:40.184 --> 05:42.393
I know, that's why I waited for the hill.

05:47.102 --> 05:48.685
Yeah, you got this. Come on.

05:48.768 --> 05:50.143
- Mike, shut up.
- Dig!

05:50.226 --> 05:51.393
Fuck you!

05:51.476 --> 05:52.935
Push it.

05:56.101 --> 05:58.268
Why are you doing this?

06:02.435 --> 06:05.351
- I just thought you'd wanna know.
- Why would I wanna know?

06:06.393 --> 06:08.060
I don't know, man.

06:09.727 --> 06:11.935
You're getting married, and...

06:13.143 --> 06:17.060
- I'm your best man, I had to tell you.
- You're not my best man anymore.

06:18.393 --> 06:20.268
I wrote a speech.

06:20.351 --> 06:22.435
I don't care.

06:26.476 --> 06:28.393
Who's gonna be your best man?

06:28.476 --> 06:29.935
Anybody, Mike.

06:30.019 --> 06:32.977
Anybody but you is gonna be my best man.

06:43.977 --> 06:46.185
That's like a $30 bidon.

06:46.268 --> 06:48.268
What does "bidon" even mean?

06:50.435 --> 06:52.810
It's a French word for bicycle water bottle.

06:52.894 --> 06:54.518
Go around!

06:55.560 --> 06:57.518
Go around!

06:57.602 --> 06:59.768
Fucking go around!

07:01.852 --> 07:03.268
Asshole!

07:03.351 --> 07:04.560
Fuck you.

07:04.643 --> 07:06.476
Motherfucker!

08:09.894 --> 08:11.310
Fuck you!

08:11.393 --> 08:13.602
What the fuck is your problem, motherfucker?

08:13.685 --> 08:15.477
Fucking asshole.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.602
Get the fuck off me!

08:28.018 --> 08:29.894
Fucking stop!

08:32.518 --> 08:34.602
Okay, okay, okay...

08:42.643 --> 08:43.560
Oh, fuck.

08:44.602 --> 08:46.101
Oh, fuck.

08:46.185 --> 08:47.851
Holy shit.

08:54.769 --> 08:56.560
Oh, horses.

08:58.101 --> 09:00.143
Thought you were a good fighter.

09:01.060 --> 09:03.226
These shoes have no traction.

09:04.560 --> 09:07.060
- <i>Swear to me that it won't happen again.</i>
- <i>I swear.</i>

09:07.143 --> 09:09.351
<i>Like you mean it, Mike.
Swear that it's not gonna happen.</i>

09:09.435 --> 09:12.185
I swear it won't happen again. I...

09:16.352 --> 09:19.143
He's saying blue, it's blue.

09:28.643 --> 09:32.643
- What's he saying?
- I don't know, he's speaking so fast.

09:37.101 --> 09:37.934
Okay.

09:48.477 --> 09:50.810
- Come, come, come.
- Okay.

10:21.644 --> 10:22.644
Hey.

10:22.727 --> 10:23.893
Hey.

10:24.934 --> 10:26.976
What happened to your hair?

10:27.060 --> 10:29.143
Oh, I had a hat on.

10:29.226 --> 10:30.685
Are you okay?

10:30.769 --> 10:32.185
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

10:32.268 --> 10:34.477
- I think I broke a rib.
- Where's Kyle?

10:34.560 --> 10:36.143
With the doctor.

10:36.226 --> 10:38.810
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, he's fine.

10:38.893 --> 10:40.893
I mean, emotionally, he's not. But...

10:40.976 --> 10:42.893
What happened?

10:45.560 --> 10:47.393
I told him about us.

10:48.602 --> 10:50.268
And he beat you up.

10:50.352 --> 10:52.018
No. A Frenchman beat me up.

10:52.101 --> 10:54.268
I think he used Krav Maga.

10:54.352 --> 10:56.935
- I wouldn't even say he beat me up...
- Mike, we talked about this.

10:57.018 --> 10:58.893
- It's over.
- I know.

10:58.976 --> 11:01.893
I know. That's what I said.
I said it was over.

11:02.893 --> 11:07.352
You know, and what we did was,
like, stupid and meaningless.

11:07.435 --> 11:09.809
Yeah. It was meaningless.

11:09.893 --> 11:13.018
- Right. That's what I said.
- And stupid.

11:15.435 --> 11:18.518
And you guys love each other
and you're getting married.

11:19.560 --> 11:22.227
Yes. We're getting married.

11:24.727 --> 11:26.602
I'm happy for you.

11:28.227 --> 11:29.851
Me too.

11:34.809 --> 11:37.143
Look, Mike, it's better like this.

11:37.227 --> 11:40.352
You know, I thought a lot about our story,
and it didn't start good.

11:40.435 --> 11:41.893
It means something.

11:41.976 --> 11:43.435
- I love you.
- You know you...

11:43.518 --> 11:46.518
Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
I don't know why I said that.

11:49.060 --> 11:51.809
Just, I think about it a lot.

11:51.893 --> 11:54.101
- What?
- And I love you.

11:55.935 --> 11:58.851
I'm sorry. I'm not thinking clearly.
I think I have a concussion.

11:58.935 --> 12:01.935
I'm sorry. Please don't tell Kyle. Fuck.

12:05.227 --> 12:06.935
Fuck!

12:14.101 --> 12:16.018
What does that mean?

12:16.101 --> 12:19.477
It means, fuck, you make me shit!

12:19.560 --> 12:21.143
I'm sorry.

12:28.768 --> 12:32.060
Oh, my God. Mike, are you serious?!
You just promised!

12:32.143 --> 12:34.310
Kyle, wait!

12:34.393 --> 12:35.685
Wait!

12:36.726 --> 12:39.060
- Can we talk?
- About what?

12:39.143 --> 12:42.851
- About this.
- I don't wanna talk about this. I hate this.

12:42.935 --> 12:44.393
Okay.

12:45.393 --> 12:48.268
Okay, you know what?
I do wanna talk about this.

12:48.352 --> 12:50.560
What's happening?

12:50.644 --> 12:53.185
- I...
- Do you love me? Look at me.

12:53.268 --> 12:55.060
- Yes.
- Okay.

12:55.143 --> 12:58.560
Good. And do you still wanna get married?

13:03.935 --> 13:07.018
<i>For the Lord himself will descend
from heaven</i>

13:07.101 --> 13:09.310
with a cry of command,

13:09.393 --> 13:11.768
with the voice of an archangel

13:11.851 --> 13:14.768
and with the sound of the trumpet of God,

13:18.352 --> 13:21.018
and the dead in Christ...

13:26.310 --> 13:31.726
And the dead in Christ will rise first.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.851
Then we who are left,

13:33.935 --> 13:35.519
who are alive,

13:35.602 --> 13:39.060
will be caught up together
with him in the clouds,

13:40.060 --> 13:43.519
so that we may meet the Lord in the air.

13:45.519 --> 13:48.519
We will always be with the Lord.

13:50.810 --> 13:55.519
Therefore, encourage one another
with these words.

13:56.560 --> 14:01.018
In the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Spirit,

14:01.102 --> 14:02.893
amen.

14:08.768 --> 14:13.143
I would just like to take a moment
to say thank you to all of you

14:13.227 --> 14:17.143
who've been here today to support the family

14:17.227 --> 14:19.435
and to support one another.

14:19.519 --> 14:21.768
We who are alive, who are left,

14:22.851 --> 14:28.102
and who right now are experiencing
a moment of immense sorrow.

14:29.143 --> 14:33.726
But our faith tells us
that this very same moment...

14:35.018 --> 14:37.601
is a moment of immense joy.

14:37.684 --> 14:40.976
And she is now in the hands
of the heavenly father.

14:42.018 --> 14:47.060
And right now, her husband, Michael,
would like to say a few words.

14:51.018 --> 14:52.435
- Thank you, Father.
- God bless.

14:52.519 --> 14:54.893
- God bless, son.
- Thanks.

14:58.935 --> 15:01.310
Thank you, Father, for the beautiful words.

15:02.310 --> 15:07.519
It's strange hearing them
because Ava really didn't believe in heaven.

15:10.601 --> 15:13.519
She was more into the idea of reincarnation.

15:13.601 --> 15:16.227
This all happened so fast.

15:16.310 --> 15:19.102
I didn't even know where to begin finding
a priest who would talk about reincarnation,

15:19.185 --> 15:23.102
so I just went with the basic package
they sold me at the funeral.

15:26.643 --> 15:28.060
I...

15:29.102 --> 15:31.060
I was planning on...

15:32.102 --> 15:33.435
Sorry.

15:34.477 --> 15:36.685
Thank you, Father, for being here.

15:37.810 --> 15:40.477
I think I'm fucking this up, my... Sorry.

15:44.435 --> 15:48.601
I'm sorry, this is a union cemetery,
I can't let you do that.

15:48.685 --> 15:50.726
I was just gonna throw some dirt on
and go home.

15:50.810 --> 15:55.394
I'm sorry. Unless you're Local 365,
I can't let you touch the equipment.

15:55.477 --> 15:57.851
- It's a fucking shovel.
- Michael, Michael, it's okay.

15:57.935 --> 15:59.768
It's okay, it's all right.

15:59.851 --> 16:03.601
I'm sorry, Father. I'm sorry, sir.
Give me the fucking shovel!

16:03.685 --> 16:05.768
I'm gonna put some dirt on
and I'm gonna go home.

16:05.851 --> 16:07.435
- Back the fuck up!
- Put the shovel down!

16:07.518 --> 16:09.102
- Back up! Get the...
- Put it down!

16:09.185 --> 16:10.310
Ava!

16:11.310 --> 16:13.102
No, no. Hey, no, no.

16:13.185 --> 16:15.102
Hey! Hey!

16:15.185 --> 16:17.810
Hey! Hey!

16:17.893 --> 16:19.394
Come on!

16:23.935 --> 16:25.518
Mike.

16:27.768 --> 16:29.269
Hey, Kyle.

16:29.352 --> 16:30.768
Hey.

16:32.601 --> 16:34.768
I didn't think you were gonna come.

16:37.810 --> 16:39.643
Thanks for coming.

16:53.352 --> 16:55.060
I miss her.

16:56.310 --> 16:57.935
Yeah, I get it.

17:01.476 --> 17:02.726
Yeah, you're...

17:02.810 --> 17:04.893
You're the only one who gets it.

17:08.726 --> 17:11.310
You know she started rescuing dogs?

17:12.726 --> 17:15.851
At one point, I had, like,
seven dogs living in my house.

17:16.851 --> 17:21.560
It was like a kennel, but they weren't,
like, normal dogs. They were street dogs.

17:21.643 --> 17:25.601
This one dog, Gus, would growl at me.
I would fear...

17:31.185 --> 17:32.976
That's the thing. It's like...

17:34.185 --> 17:38.434
We built this life together, but...
It wasn't perfect, but it was ours.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.601
She was patient and loving.

17:46.852 --> 17:48.434
People would tell me
that when you get married,

17:48.518 --> 17:51.102
the sex is supposed to go downhill,
but it didn't.

17:51.185 --> 17:54.227
It went uphill. Like, fast up hill.

17:54.310 --> 17:56.060
Got, like, real crazy.

17:56.143 --> 17:59.476
- We started getting...
- Come here, come here, hey.

18:09.434 --> 18:11.935
Now I'm stuck with all these dogs.

18:19.060 --> 18:21.310
You were my best friend.

18:24.685 --> 18:27.810
And I know I lost that. You know, but...

18:30.269 --> 18:32.810
Now I lost my wife.

18:36.560 --> 18:37.935
I'm sorry.

18:38.935 --> 18:40.685
I'm sorry.

18:52.310 --> 18:53.726
I'm not sorry for being with her, obviously,

18:53.810 --> 18:56.560
because I loved her
and I would do that again.

18:56.643 --> 18:59.435
But I'm sorry for what it did to us,
you know?

21:23.268 --> 21:27.019
- Hey. I was doing the whole seduction thing.
- Yeah, I can see that.

21:28.060 --> 21:29.476
I thought you thought it was funny.

21:29.560 --> 21:34.476
It was funny when you were fat.
But now it just feels too serious.

21:35.476 --> 21:37.060
Are you gonna talk to them?

21:37.144 --> 21:40.852
- It's Thanksgiving, I'll talk to everyone.
- Kyle, I'm fucking serious.

21:40.935 --> 21:43.977
Okay, I will. But if we make this
into a thing, it's gonna be a thing.

21:44.060 --> 21:45.184
It is a thing.

21:45.268 --> 21:48.102
- Kyle, turkey's ready.
- You need to tell her.

21:48.184 --> 21:50.893
- Okay, Mom!
- You know your mom doesn't like me.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.393
What are you talking about?
My mom loves you.

21:52.476 --> 21:53.935
She didn't like me in high school.

21:54.977 --> 21:58.560
That's not true.
Also, you shouldn't smoke in here.

21:58.643 --> 22:01.268
Because she can smell it
and it's like a whole thing.

22:01.351 --> 22:03.810
Kyle, this turkey needs to be cut!

22:03.893 --> 22:06.685
- Okay, Mom, I'm coming!
- Just tell her no.

22:07.685 --> 22:08.977
What?

22:09.060 --> 22:10.768
But I'm the turkey cutter.

22:11.768 --> 22:14.518
Have you ever said no to your mother?

22:14.602 --> 22:15.643
Yeah.

22:16.643 --> 22:18.518
I honestly don't believe that you have.

22:19.560 --> 22:22.310
- Okay.
- Let's just practice. Just say it to me.

22:22.393 --> 22:23.768
Just say no.

22:23.852 --> 22:25.435
No.

22:25.518 --> 22:27.143
I don't believe it.

22:27.226 --> 22:29.560
Okay, let's try...

22:30.560 --> 22:33.143
Kyle, can you take me to the airport?

22:33.226 --> 22:34.852
Sure.

22:34.935 --> 22:36.435
I mean, no.

22:36.518 --> 22:38.727
Wait. Do you have to go to the airport?

22:38.810 --> 22:41.435
- Because...
- Okay, let's just try it again.

22:41.518 --> 22:43.060
We're just saying no.

22:43.143 --> 22:44.685
Okay.

22:45.977 --> 22:49.310
Kyle, can you take me to the airport?

22:49.393 --> 22:50.894
No.

22:52.685 --> 22:54.643
Here. Just ask me something.

22:54.727 --> 22:57.852
- Okay. Can you take me to the airport?
- No.

22:57.935 --> 22:59.935
Absolutely not.

23:00.019 --> 23:01.768
- Did you believe me?
- Yeah.

23:01.852 --> 23:02.685
Good.

23:03.685 --> 23:06.393
Can you take me to the airport?

23:06.476 --> 23:07.768
No.

23:07.852 --> 23:09.768
No, you need to mean it.

23:09.852 --> 23:11.977
- No.
- No, say it again.

23:12.059 --> 23:13.476
- No.
- No.

23:13.560 --> 23:14.810
No!

23:14.894 --> 23:17.727
- No!
- No. No!

23:17.810 --> 23:18.852
No!

23:18.935 --> 23:20.351
- No!
- No!

23:20.435 --> 23:23.935
- No! Kyle! Can you take me to the airport?
- No. No!

23:24.019 --> 23:25.685
Yeah.

23:25.768 --> 23:27.518
Yeah.

23:30.019 --> 23:31.852
Yeah, that was good.

23:48.019 --> 23:49.351
Yes.

23:49.435 --> 23:50.768
Oh, fuck.

23:50.852 --> 23:53.935
Fuck! Fuck, fuck.

23:57.018 --> 23:59.101
Mom, what are you doing?

23:59.185 --> 24:02.226
- I think they're fighting.
- You have to give them some privacy.

24:02.310 --> 24:04.602
- Well, it's my house.
- Dani, we don't like her.

24:04.685 --> 24:06.810
Wait, why don't we like her?

24:06.894 --> 24:08.143
Because.

24:09.185 --> 24:13.518
Kyle, please,
your father's cutting the turkey!

24:16.018 --> 24:17.810
Who wants a Manhattan?

24:17.894 --> 24:20.518
Yes, yes, Grandma, you want a Manhattan?

24:20.602 --> 24:22.810
Of course!

24:24.977 --> 24:27.018
Dad, Dad, Dad, you can't cut it like that.

24:27.101 --> 24:30.643
- You can't cut right down the middle.
- Okay, well, it was getting cold, so I...

24:30.727 --> 24:34.976
- It's okay, I got it. I'll take it.
- All right. Let me know when it's done.

24:35.059 --> 24:36.602
Mama.

24:36.685 --> 24:38.560
- Want a Manhattan?
- Of course.

24:38.643 --> 24:42.351
Of course. Oh, my God.
Mom, that looks so good.

24:46.185 --> 24:48.351
Kyle, is everything okay?

24:48.435 --> 24:49.602
Yeah, why?

24:49.685 --> 24:52.602
- I thought I heard fighting downstairs.
- No, we're fine.

24:52.685 --> 24:55.852
- If you're going through a rough patch...
- Mom, Mom, please. Just stop.

24:55.935 --> 24:57.727
I'm sorry. I know you've been through a lot.

24:57.810 --> 25:02.477
I didn't like her when you were together in
high school, then you followed her to SUNY...

25:02.560 --> 25:04.602
- I chose to go.
- You got in to Amherst.

25:04.685 --> 25:07.894
- Mom, we're not having this conversation.
- She broke up with you, the first semester.

25:07.976 --> 25:10.560
Kyle, your commercial's on. Come on!

25:11.643 --> 25:12.894
Oh, my God.

25:12.976 --> 25:14.560
Come on.

25:17.310 --> 25:18.894
- Where's the remote?
- I don't know.

25:18.976 --> 25:20.518
- I don't know.
- It's over there.

25:20.602 --> 25:22.477
Do you have to sit down every time?

25:22.560 --> 25:25.477
- No. Why would I take it upstairs?
- Because you always do.

25:25.560 --> 25:27.934
- Got it, got it. Okay.
- Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up.

25:28.018 --> 25:30.310
<i>Side effects of Vulvitra
may include bleeding,</i>

25:30.393 --> 25:32.435
<i>hemorrhaging, dizziness, and seizures.</i>

25:32.518 --> 25:34.727
- What's going on?
- It's Kyle's commercial, Grandma.

25:34.810 --> 25:37.810
<i>Users have reported severe mood swings
and suicidal thoughts.</i>

25:37.894 --> 25:42.810
<i>Those taking birth control should talk
to your doctor before using Vulvitra.</i>

25:47.226 --> 25:50.435
- It's so good!
- Kyle, it's amazing!

25:50.518 --> 25:52.727
I just did the jingle, so...

25:53.810 --> 25:55.185
What does it do?

25:55.268 --> 25:57.893
It's Viagra for women, Grandma.
It makes you wet.

25:57.976 --> 26:00.352
- Bianca.
- What?

26:01.477 --> 26:02.810
- Oh, that's nice.
- Tone it down.

26:02.893 --> 26:06.560
- Pretty good marketing.
- Yeah, big pharma's got their...

26:06.643 --> 26:08.310
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:08.393 --> 26:11.976
- Oh, your skirt's...
- Thank you.

26:18.018 --> 26:19.685
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:19.769 --> 26:21.226
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:21.310 --> 26:22.435
Hi.

26:22.518 --> 26:24.435
- You want a Manhattan?
- No, I'm good.

26:24.518 --> 26:28.560
Kyle and I are doing this no-sugar diet.

26:28.643 --> 26:29.810
There's sugar in this?

26:29.893 --> 26:31.727
- I thought this was just alcohol.
- Hey.

26:31.810 --> 26:34.727
- You just missed Kyle's commercial.
- I've seen it.

26:34.810 --> 26:36.435
- Isn't it great?
- Yeah.

26:36.518 --> 26:39.393
Doesn't it feel like it was written
for men though?

26:39.477 --> 26:41.393
Oh, it was written for men.

26:41.477 --> 26:44.602
- Well, I thought it was great.
- Looking good, Kyle.

26:44.685 --> 26:45.893
- So did I.
- Lose some weight?

26:45.976 --> 26:48.934
- Yeah, Marissa's made me work out.
- I bet she is.

26:49.018 --> 26:52.352
Listen, for New Year's,
Jim bought all of us tickets

26:52.435 --> 26:55.602
to the Thomas Olivan,
so I don't know what your plans were.

26:55.685 --> 26:58.352
But if you wanted to join us,
we could get an extra ticket.

26:58.435 --> 27:01.685
So there's a full dinner and live music.

27:01.769 --> 27:04.101
Yeah, the DJ, Tom and orchestra's playing.

27:04.185 --> 27:09.060
That's cool. Actually, Kyle and I planned
this big ski trip for New Year's.

27:09.143 --> 27:11.560
I thought he might have
told you guys about it.

27:11.644 --> 27:13.268
- No, no.
- Hey, Kyle?

27:13.352 --> 27:15.435
- Yeah?
- Come in here for a second?

27:15.518 --> 27:16.851
Sure.

27:18.518 --> 27:20.018
Are you drinking right now?

27:20.101 --> 27:22.893
Yeah, Kyle, you know the tickets
for the Thomas Olivan,

27:22.976 --> 27:25.560
they're nonrefundable,
so maybe you could just push

27:25.644 --> 27:28.809
your dates back, for your trip,
a couple days?

27:29.851 --> 27:31.393
No.

27:32.560 --> 27:36.310
I'm sorry, Mom. No.
I'll pay for the tickets.

27:36.393 --> 27:38.352
Kyle, it's not about the money.

27:38.435 --> 27:40.393
What is it about?

27:40.477 --> 27:42.435
- Family. You know, family?
- Guys, can we...?

27:42.518 --> 27:45.727
- Families spend the holidays together.
- I agree.

27:46.935 --> 27:50.769
So, what did we decide, then?
Should I get another ticket?

27:50.851 --> 27:51.809
- No.
- No.

27:51.893 --> 27:54.226
- Okay.
- Kyle, can...?

27:54.310 --> 27:56.769
You need to tell her. Now.

28:01.060 --> 28:03.101
We're getting married.

28:05.393 --> 28:06.851
Well, congratulations.

28:06.935 --> 28:09.976
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

28:10.060 --> 28:12.518
Congratulations.

28:12.602 --> 28:14.976
- What's happening?
- They're getting married.

28:15.060 --> 28:17.060
Oh, my God.

28:17.143 --> 28:18.310
Sisters!

28:18.393 --> 28:20.768
- Oh, my God.
- What?

28:20.851 --> 28:22.185
We're getting married.

28:22.268 --> 28:24.185
- No, really?
- Yeah.

28:24.268 --> 28:27.018
- Oh, my God. Let me see the ring.
- Oh, it's... I'm designing it.

28:28.060 --> 28:28.893
Yeah.

28:28.976 --> 28:31.268
- Wait, they're getting married?
- You did great.

28:31.352 --> 28:32.976
Oh, my God.

28:33.060 --> 28:34.727
What's going on?

28:34.809 --> 28:37.477
Kyle got engaged, Grandma.

28:37.560 --> 28:39.727
Oh, my God.

28:39.809 --> 28:42.519
Grandma. I'm getting married.

28:42.602 --> 28:44.268
- Yeah.
- Nice.

28:44.352 --> 28:46.435
- Marissa.
- Hi.

28:46.519 --> 28:50.352
- Oh, yeah, nice to meet you.
- We've met.

28:51.393 --> 28:52.893
Mom, I'm sorry.

28:52.976 --> 28:56.227
- I was gonna tell you sooner.
- It's okay. I'm happy if you're happy.

28:56.310 --> 28:58.602
- Okay. Thanks.
- Are you happy?

28:59.644 --> 29:01.393
- Yes.
- Good.

29:01.477 --> 29:04.519
I'm really sorry about all the things
that I said about her before.

29:04.602 --> 29:06.602
It's just that you're my only son.

29:06.685 --> 29:10.935
And I want what's best for you.
All right? And I love you.

29:11.018 --> 29:12.976
I love you too, Mom.

29:17.101 --> 29:19.685
I invited Mike for Christmas.

29:22.352 --> 29:23.810
- What?
- Yes.

29:23.893 --> 29:27.185
- You invited Mike? What are you doing?
- I did, I know, I know. Listen to me.

29:27.268 --> 29:30.519
There's nothing that's gonna make that okay.
But he is not doing well.

29:30.602 --> 29:34.060
He has no family. We were his only family.
And now he has no one.

29:34.143 --> 29:36.477
He should have thought about that
before he fu...

29:36.560 --> 29:39.268
- Kyle, wait a minute, I taught you...
- Are we really having this conversation?

29:39.352 --> 29:41.227
...how to be caring
and compassionate and forgiving,

29:41.310 --> 29:44.810
so maybe you should look at this
as a test to see if you can...

29:44.893 --> 29:46.352
- No!
- What?

29:46.435 --> 29:49.560
- No, no, no, Gertie!
- Oh, my gosh! Gertie, really?

29:49.644 --> 29:51.519
- What happened?
- He ate the turkey!

29:51.602 --> 29:53.768
- Gertie!
- No! No, no.

29:53.851 --> 29:55.810
Outside.

30:56.435 --> 30:58.352
Oh, fuck.

31:01.310 --> 31:02.810
Shit.

31:59.519 --> 32:01.559
Okay, here's what you do.

32:01.643 --> 32:04.227
Keep a small bottle of vodka
in your glove compartment.

32:04.310 --> 32:08.352
And when you get in an accident,
then slam that bottle of vodka down.

32:08.435 --> 32:10.643
- Yeah?
- Right in front of them.

32:10.726 --> 32:14.268
That way, they can't prove whether
you were drunk before or after the accident.

32:14.352 --> 32:16.768
- So this is real-world advice?
- Foolproof.

32:16.851 --> 32:19.352
Yeah. Dani, get the door!

32:19.435 --> 32:20.435
I'm coming.

32:20.518 --> 32:22.477
I always wondered
what it'd be like to run a train.

32:22.559 --> 32:23.977
Oh, hey, Gertie.

32:24.060 --> 32:28.310
- Oh, my God. Mike, hey. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Dani.

32:28.394 --> 32:30.685
- Hey, come in.
- Hey.

32:30.768 --> 32:32.310
- Good to see you.
- You too.

32:32.394 --> 32:34.559
There's food in the dining room
and drinks in the kitchen.

32:34.643 --> 32:35.643
Okay, thanks.

32:35.726 --> 32:37.768
Sure. Come on, Gertie.

32:38.768 --> 32:40.977
- Is that Michael?
- Hey, Grandma.

32:41.060 --> 32:43.893
- What happened?
- I don't know.

32:45.310 --> 32:48.851
But listen to me,
you gotta go get a haircut, okay?

32:48.935 --> 32:52.685
Oh, this guy doesn't need a haircut.
He's a lady-killer.

32:52.768 --> 32:55.810
He's like a hawk, he just swoops in.

32:55.893 --> 32:58.394
- You doing all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay, Uncle Mark.

32:58.476 --> 33:01.269
- You know the cheesecake you love?
- Kid's only a freshman.

33:01.352 --> 33:04.977
He doesn't have a rocket arm yet,
but he's got great feet.

33:05.060 --> 33:09.559
Suzi and I drove up to the Carrier Dome
to watch him in the state game.

33:09.643 --> 33:12.726
- He's already got offers from Rutgers...
- Hey, Daddy, look who's here.

33:12.810 --> 33:15.476
- Oh, my God. Mike.
- Hey.

33:15.559 --> 33:17.435
It's great to see you, kiddo.

33:17.518 --> 33:19.768
- Good to see you, Jim.
- You too.

33:19.851 --> 33:24.185
Just telling George about this new freshman
quarterback they got at your college.

33:24.269 --> 33:26.559
- Have you seen this kid yet?
- No, I haven't.

33:26.643 --> 33:27.935
- Want a drink?
- Yeah.

33:28.018 --> 33:29.643
- Take mine. I just made it.
- Thank you.

33:29.726 --> 33:31.060
Your sweater's on backwards.

33:31.143 --> 33:33.227
I'll never forget that game
against Fox Lane.

33:33.310 --> 33:36.851
You faked that defensive end
right out of his jockstrap.

33:36.935 --> 33:39.768
You guys made a great team. You ought to...

33:43.018 --> 33:45.310
- Hey, Mike's here.
- Okay.

33:45.394 --> 33:49.726
- He's kind of fat, just a heads-up.
- Why would I need a heads-up?

33:49.810 --> 33:52.018
- Well...
- Kyle, Mike's in the living room.

33:52.102 --> 33:53.851
- Yeah, I just told him.
- He got fat.

33:53.935 --> 33:55.643
- Right?
- Yeah.

33:56.643 --> 33:59.018
- You okay?
- Yeah, fine.

33:59.102 --> 34:01.185
- Are you gonna talk to him?
- I don't know, Dani.

34:01.269 --> 34:03.810
- Where are you going?
- How's the whole jewelry website going?

34:03.893 --> 34:06.476
It's good. Kyle started working with me.

34:07.518 --> 34:09.643
I thought he already had a job.

34:09.726 --> 34:13.060
Yeah, I think he's gonna quit.
We got so many orders this Christmas.

34:13.143 --> 34:14.935
And Kyle got really good at gift wrapping.

34:15.018 --> 34:17.560
- You guys make a great team.
- Yeah.

34:17.643 --> 34:18.977
I'm gonna get some air.

34:19.977 --> 34:24.560
Mike had that! He was a natural athlete.
Shame he didn't play in college.

34:24.643 --> 34:26.434
- Who?
- Mike.

34:26.518 --> 34:30.768
- Hey, what were you guys talking about?
- Fashion.

34:30.852 --> 34:34.726
Fashion? Does she know
more about fashion than we do?

34:34.810 --> 34:37.476
- Why are you even friends with her?
- She's cool.

34:37.560 --> 34:40.185
How is she cool?

35:01.976 --> 35:07.601
Jim Harrison says, "I never understood
the acceptance of bad ham in America."

35:07.684 --> 35:13.393
And I gotta agree with him. I mean,
think about it. One ham is really good.

35:13.476 --> 35:17.144
I mean, why do we need any more, huh?
What's the point?

35:17.227 --> 35:18.893
It's so amazing

35:19.935 --> 35:22.852
to go to an actual ham-bake

35:23.893 --> 35:29.144
that, you know, dug a pit in the ground
and there was like 50 hams in there...

35:30.852 --> 35:35.060
Pitchforks, they toss them around.
Incredible.

35:36.102 --> 35:40.144
But most of the time,
it's just that watery ham bullshit.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.269
Excuse me.

36:06.852 --> 36:11.060
Can you bring the firewood in from the side
of the house while you're out here?

36:11.144 --> 36:12.518
Sure.

36:12.601 --> 36:16.102
Also, stop smoking. It's disgusting.

36:18.185 --> 36:21.309
Suzi, are you fucking kidding me?
Why did you invite him?

36:21.393 --> 36:23.393
- Because.
- That's not a reason.

36:23.476 --> 36:24.768
Look, he's family.

36:24.852 --> 36:29.351
He's not family. He grew up with us,
now he's ruining our lives...

37:27.852 --> 37:30.102
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:31.102 --> 37:33.643
- Is that my football helmet?
- Yeah.

37:35.144 --> 37:37.393
I should have played in college.

37:38.685 --> 37:41.019
- Hey.
- Hi.

37:43.019 --> 37:45.102
How's everything going?

37:46.226 --> 37:47.852
Great.

37:47.935 --> 37:49.184
Yeah?

37:50.184 --> 37:51.643
Yeah.

37:53.310 --> 37:54.476
What's great?

37:55.476 --> 37:59.560
- <i>Peaky Blinders.</i> It's pretty great.
- Oh, okay.

37:59.643 --> 38:03.019
What else? Besides <i>Peaky Blinders.</i>

38:04.435 --> 38:05.518
That's about it.

38:06.560 --> 38:09.643
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

38:09.727 --> 38:12.351
With your life. What are you doing?

38:13.518 --> 38:16.977
What is this?
Is this, like, an intervention?

38:17.060 --> 38:20.310
Are you trying to have,
like, a Christmas intervention on me?

38:20.393 --> 38:22.560
Yes, this is a Christmas intervention.

38:22.643 --> 38:27.060
Okay, well, thank you very much,
but I don't want one.

38:28.977 --> 38:30.852
What do you want?

38:30.935 --> 38:32.810
Nothing.

38:32.893 --> 38:35.476
You want me to be, like, happy?

38:35.560 --> 38:39.852
And you wanna know that I'm okay
and everything's okay?

38:39.935 --> 38:41.727
I'm not okay.

38:41.810 --> 38:44.768
- You ever feel sorry for yourself?
- All the time.

38:44.852 --> 38:46.935
Yeah, stop doing that.

38:48.643 --> 38:51.351
Why did you invite me here?
Your son hates me.

38:51.435 --> 38:54.518
- Yeah, he should hate you.
- I know. I'm a bad friend.

38:54.602 --> 38:56.310
I'm like the shitty person.

38:56.393 --> 38:59.102
Okay, so fix it.

38:59.184 --> 39:00.310
How?

39:00.393 --> 39:02.727
Stop being selfish.

39:03.727 --> 39:07.643
What you did to him was selfish
and he was destroyed by it.

39:07.727 --> 39:13.184
So stop thinking about yourself and how sad
your life is and think about somebody else.

39:13.268 --> 39:16.435
You know, it just might make you feel good.

39:18.268 --> 39:19.977
Okay.

39:20.060 --> 39:25.685
Kyle is selfless. He always thinks about
other people first. He always has.

39:25.768 --> 39:27.894
And people take advantage of that.

39:28.894 --> 39:30.060
And now...

39:31.060 --> 39:34.393
he's getting married, and I don't know.

39:34.476 --> 39:36.226
What do you mean?

39:36.310 --> 39:38.476
I mean, I don't know.

39:39.518 --> 39:42.393
- About Marissa?
- Yeah.

39:43.518 --> 39:45.268
I don't know.

39:47.685 --> 39:49.393
I'm glad you're here.

39:50.393 --> 39:52.935
Sometimes when you think
you're doing the right thing,

39:53.019 --> 39:54.727
it hurts the people you love.

39:55.727 --> 39:58.602
And then sometimes when you think
you're doing the wrong thing,

39:58.685 --> 40:01.727
it's actually what's needed.

40:04.852 --> 40:09.643
If you want to be a part of this family,
then act like it.

40:50.101 --> 40:51.977
Might get well tonight.

40:52.977 --> 40:55.435
- But what'd he do?
- What are you talking about?

40:55.518 --> 40:57.143
But for a job?

40:57.226 --> 40:59.268
- Hey, Mike.
- Hey, Kyle.

40:59.351 --> 41:01.977
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry...

41:03.018 --> 41:04.810
- Oh, my God! Mike.
- What happened?

41:04.894 --> 41:06.393
- Mike.
- Oh, my God. Dad!

41:06.477 --> 41:07.685
Give him some room.

41:07.768 --> 41:09.268
- Dad.
- Let's get him over.

41:09.351 --> 41:11.268
- Holy shit.
- How much did he have to drink?

41:11.351 --> 41:15.185
- I gave him one eggnog.
- How strong was it?

41:15.268 --> 41:16.685
Is he dead?

41:16.769 --> 41:19.018
- Yeah, pretty strong.
- Give him some water.

41:19.101 --> 41:23.685
He'll be all right. He's gonna be fine.
I've seen him take bigger hits than that.

41:23.769 --> 41:26.393
- Just leave him.
- Is that Mike?

41:26.477 --> 41:27.351
Yeah.

41:28.393 --> 41:30.059
He got fat.

41:31.143 --> 41:33.268
- He looks bad.
- Maybe he just lost his balance.

41:33.351 --> 41:35.268
I don't know about that table.

41:35.351 --> 41:37.602
Gosh, I should really spend
some more time with him.

41:37.685 --> 41:40.101
- Should we pull him up?
- Yeah, I guess we should let him...

41:40.185 --> 41:44.226
- Put him in a bed or something, Daddy?
- No, I think he's fine right here.

41:44.310 --> 41:45.477
No, no, no!

42:43.226 --> 42:44.934
No, she quit.

42:57.060 --> 42:59.685
Remember the blizzard of '96?

42:59.769 --> 43:00.852
Yeah.

43:01.852 --> 43:03.643
That was crazy.

43:05.477 --> 43:07.268
So glad you made it out.

43:07.352 --> 43:09.560
Yeah, man. Thanks for inviting me.

43:13.435 --> 43:16.518
- Are the boots supposed to hurt so much?
- Yeah.

43:18.018 --> 43:20.018
You know those mountains allow skiing
and snowboarding?

43:20.101 --> 43:23.518
Yeah, they're too crowded,
and the snowboarders push off all the snow.

43:24.518 --> 43:26.477
Kyle's a snowboarder.

43:26.560 --> 43:28.226
Yeah, well, he's skiing now.

43:29.310 --> 43:32.393
It's fine. I learned how to ski, it's fine.

43:35.685 --> 43:38.727
- Hey, we should do Catapult next.
- Okay.

43:38.810 --> 43:41.518
No, that's a black diamond.
I don't think you're ready for that.

43:41.602 --> 43:43.685
- Okay.
- It's a hill. You just go down it.

43:43.769 --> 43:45.477
Yeah, but he's gonna crash.

43:45.560 --> 43:49.060
- It's snow. If he crashes, it's snow.
- I'd rather not crash.

43:49.143 --> 43:51.769
- Kyle, no one wants to crash.
- Sorry, what is your point?

43:51.851 --> 43:56.393
We're here on the mountain and we're going
down the bunny slopes with all the children,

43:56.477 --> 43:59.560
and, Kyle, you're a natural athlete.

43:59.644 --> 44:02.727
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah. You can do any of these runs.

44:02.809 --> 44:05.851
- I mean, look at that cliff over there.
- Okay, great. Kyle, listen to me.

44:05.935 --> 44:09.477
It's your choice, but I wouldn't do it.

44:15.435 --> 44:18.352
Can we just do A Cat's Meow
a couple more times?

44:18.435 --> 44:20.602
- Yeah, cool.
- Sweet.

44:23.185 --> 44:25.018
I'm doing Catapult.

44:36.602 --> 44:37.809
Drink.

44:38.851 --> 44:41.060
- Drink.
- Okay. All right.

44:42.893 --> 44:45.060
- But you already know that.
- I know.

44:45.143 --> 44:47.602
Okay, never have I ever had Lyme disease.

44:47.685 --> 44:51.143
- You have had Lyme disease though.
- Yeah, but you haven't.

44:51.227 --> 44:53.310
I know. That's not how
this game works. Drink.

44:53.393 --> 44:55.976
- What? Again?
- Yeah.

44:56.060 --> 44:58.477
Can we just try playing a different game?

44:58.560 --> 45:00.268
- What?
- Let's do Rock, Paper, Scissors.

45:00.352 --> 45:02.310
Okay, so if I win, you have to drink.

45:02.393 --> 45:04.602
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

45:05.851 --> 45:08.185
Again. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

45:08.268 --> 45:09.477
Drink!

45:09.560 --> 45:12.310
- Ready? Rock, paper...
- No, no, I'm done. I'm done.

45:12.393 --> 45:16.227
- Never have I ever been caught streaking.
- What? We did that together.

45:16.310 --> 45:18.727
- Yeah, but I didn't get caught.
- It was your idea. Okay.

45:18.809 --> 45:20.143
Never have I ever spent so much time

45:20.227 --> 45:22.726
with the school counselor doing,
like, morality training.

45:22.809 --> 45:27.477
I was like, "Why is Kyle's butt so small?"
It's disproportionate with your body.

45:27.560 --> 45:30.851
- Never have I ever been ice fishing.
- I've never been ice fishing.

45:30.935 --> 45:32.310
I want to.

45:32.393 --> 45:34.477
Never have I ever been allergic
to peanut butter.

45:34.560 --> 45:37.143
Now you're just listing allergies
you know I have.

45:37.227 --> 45:38.393
Drink.

45:38.477 --> 45:41.809
- Okay, what are you allergic to?
- I'm not gonna tell you.

45:41.893 --> 45:43.685
- What are you guys doing?
- JÃ¤germeister.

45:43.768 --> 45:46.768
- Why?
- It's a ski trip and it has alcohol in it.

45:46.851 --> 45:48.851
- Wait, where's the cheese?
- What cheese?

45:48.935 --> 45:52.435
The cheese that I... The large block
of cheese that I just brought out.

45:52.519 --> 45:55.851
- Was I not supposed to eat it?
- No, it was for the bread.

45:55.935 --> 45:58.935
- What bread?
- The bread that I'm making.

46:02.185 --> 46:03.227
Thanks, babe.

46:03.310 --> 46:07.018
Okay, never have I ever been questioned
about how I was touching a dog.

46:07.101 --> 46:07.976
That never happened.

46:08.060 --> 46:10.101
I'm not saying
you inappropriately touched a dog.

46:10.185 --> 46:12.018
I'm saying,
never have I ever been questioned,

46:12.101 --> 46:13.810
like, "Kyle, what are you doing
with that dog?"

46:13.893 --> 46:15.227
Okay.

46:17.352 --> 46:21.018
You just keep asking me things
you know the answers to already.

46:21.101 --> 46:24.101
- Yeah, I know. That's the point.
- Okay.

46:24.185 --> 46:29.185
All right, well, then, never have I ever
warmed up chicken cutlets to masturbate.

46:31.726 --> 46:32.810
There you go.

46:32.893 --> 46:36.101
See? It's, like, super simple
if you just understand...

46:36.185 --> 46:38.976
Are you guys playing Never Have I Ever
with two people right now?

46:39.060 --> 46:41.602
- Yeah, we're catching up.
- Do you wanna play?

46:41.684 --> 46:45.435
No. I just want to relax
and have a glass of wine like an adult.

46:45.519 --> 46:48.602
If you do wine and JÃ¤germeister together,
it's like a whole experience.

46:48.684 --> 46:49.684
I won't.

46:49.768 --> 46:52.185
- Oh, this looks good, babe.
- Thanks.

46:53.227 --> 46:54.477
Okay, I got one.

46:55.519 --> 47:00.393
Never have I ever given a hand job
after junior prom

47:00.477 --> 47:04.227
at John Nicola's party to...

47:04.310 --> 47:05.976
- Kevin.
- You bitch.

47:06.060 --> 47:07.519
...Kevin Farrell.

47:08.560 --> 47:13.602
Never did I ever give a hand job
to Kevin Farrell after junior prom. Drink.

47:14.976 --> 47:17.352
Kyle, will you help me with the kitchen?

47:17.435 --> 47:18.976
Hold on.

47:20.102 --> 47:23.185
Never have I ever been asked
to help with the kitchen.

47:23.268 --> 47:25.185
Okay, Mike.

47:27.893 --> 47:29.268
All right.

47:35.893 --> 47:37.435
Really?

47:38.976 --> 47:40.893
I'm sorry about...

47:45.185 --> 47:47.601
- Oh, my God!
- I just took it out of the oven.

47:47.684 --> 47:49.477
- It's so hot.
- Put your...

47:49.560 --> 47:51.684
Why would it be so hot?

47:52.726 --> 47:56.102
Why is he still here?
He was only supposed to stay for the day.

47:56.185 --> 47:58.268
- Yeah, well, he broke his wrist.
- Yeah, I'm aware.

47:58.352 --> 48:00.519
We were in the hospital for four hours.

48:00.601 --> 48:03.143
He has a car. He'll leave.

48:03.227 --> 48:06.018
Yeah, but he's on painkillers
and now he's drunk, so...

48:06.102 --> 48:08.810
- Yeah, you're drinking with him.
- Yeah, so?

48:08.893 --> 48:11.310
I just want to be drunk with you

48:11.394 --> 48:14.685
and, like, be naked

48:14.768 --> 48:18.477
in every room and, like,
have sex everywhere.

48:18.559 --> 48:19.976
Okay.

48:23.477 --> 48:25.893
Look, he's... He's gotta go.

48:25.976 --> 48:32.060
- Yeah, he's gonna go tomorrow, so...
- No, no. I mean, like, he's gotta go away.

48:32.143 --> 48:34.893
Like, somewhere else that's...

48:34.976 --> 48:37.435
like, not in our lives.

48:38.477 --> 48:40.519
But he's my friend.

48:42.268 --> 48:43.726
I know.

48:45.268 --> 48:47.102
You're the best.

48:48.435 --> 48:50.893
But I can't do this.

48:51.935 --> 48:54.310
Hey, you guys have any more wine?

48:55.601 --> 48:57.185
You finished that guy?

48:57.268 --> 49:00.060
- I did, yeah. Thank you.
- It's impressive.

49:00.143 --> 49:04.018
Yeah. We do have more wine.
It's in the fridge. You just help yourself.

49:04.102 --> 49:05.268
That's mine.

49:06.310 --> 49:07.559
You have a...

49:08.601 --> 49:12.394
Kyle, I'm gonna go to bed.

49:12.477 --> 49:14.102
- Okay.
- Good night!

49:15.102 --> 49:17.018
Twist top. Sweet.

49:19.643 --> 49:21.143
Whole thing?

49:21.227 --> 49:22.685
Yeah.

49:25.768 --> 49:27.435
Why do you have to be like this?

49:28.435 --> 49:29.935
Like what?

49:30.977 --> 49:33.601
- Fuckup.
- Oh, fuck! It's hot.

49:37.435 --> 49:39.601
All right, listen, I'm going to bed.

49:39.685 --> 49:43.851
The pillow and blanket are
behind the couch, so...

49:43.935 --> 49:47.102
Wait, wait, Kyle, Kyle. Where are you going?

49:48.143 --> 49:49.810
Going to bed.

49:51.518 --> 49:54.269
- But it's New Year's Eve.
- Yeah, I'm aware.

49:54.352 --> 49:58.768
- So are you gonna have sex?
- That's none of your business.

49:58.851 --> 50:00.394
But it's almost midnight.

50:00.476 --> 50:04.102
So if you're not gonna have sex,
we should bang pots and pans.

50:05.435 --> 50:06.559
- Going to bed.
- It's a tradition.

50:06.643 --> 50:09.851
If you're not gonna bang with her,
we should bang pots and pans.

50:10.893 --> 50:14.394
- I'm going to bed, Mike. Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

50:17.643 --> 50:20.227
Wait, wait. Wait, Kyle. Kyle?

50:21.227 --> 50:22.726
Yeah?

50:22.810 --> 50:24.352
Hey, man.

50:25.560 --> 50:28.893
I just wanna say, like, thank you.

50:28.977 --> 50:31.185
You know, for having me here.

50:31.269 --> 50:32.518
And...

50:33.560 --> 50:36.352
You know, for being, like, friends again.

50:36.434 --> 50:38.768
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.

50:38.851 --> 50:42.977
- I'm trying to be less selfish. You know?
- Right now? Yeah.

50:43.060 --> 50:47.851
And I think about others before myself.
And I think about you a lot.

50:47.935 --> 50:50.394
You know, and it's like...

50:50.476 --> 50:54.685
I know you guys are engaged
and you're gonna get married and everything.

50:54.768 --> 50:56.434
But, you know, I don't know.

50:57.476 --> 50:59.227
What does that mean?

51:00.393 --> 51:02.185
I don't know.

51:03.518 --> 51:06.018
I just wanna fix things with us, you know?

51:07.060 --> 51:08.269
And...

51:09.310 --> 51:12.893
Sometimes when you're trying
to do the right thing, it's the wrong thing.

51:12.977 --> 51:14.518
Do you know what I mean?

51:15.560 --> 51:16.560
No.

51:17.601 --> 51:19.310
Okay. Yeah.

51:20.352 --> 51:22.852
- Right. Okay.
- Okay.

51:25.434 --> 51:27.893
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

51:27.977 --> 51:30.434
Never have I never been named Kyle.

53:01.018 --> 53:02.560
Kyle.

53:04.018 --> 53:06.393
Kyle. Kyle.

53:07.435 --> 53:09.060
Kyle, wake up.

53:10.227 --> 53:12.435
Kyle, wake up. Kyle.

53:13.476 --> 53:16.601
Kyle, wake up, you bitch.

53:17.643 --> 53:21.144
Wake up, I wanna do butt stuff. Kyle.

53:34.685 --> 53:36.309
Fuck.

53:43.727 --> 53:46.268
Happy New Year!

53:54.309 --> 53:56.893
<i>That's when I realized he's my best friend.</i>

53:56.977 --> 53:58.560
Yeah.

54:00.226 --> 54:02.060
Why are you marrying him?

54:08.643 --> 54:10.393
Because...

54:11.518 --> 54:16.643
he is loyal and he's a good person.

54:16.727 --> 54:20.852
And he's... He'll always be there, and...

54:20.935 --> 54:25.768
I don't know. And the sex is great.
I don't know, why did you marry your wife?

54:25.852 --> 54:27.977
Because I loved her.

54:35.226 --> 54:39.435
- How's your brother Ronnie doing? Yeah?
- He's good. He's better.

54:41.060 --> 54:43.476
Is he still dealing drugs?

54:44.727 --> 54:49.351
No, I don't think so.
They weren't drugs. It was painkillers.

54:51.268 --> 54:54.977
- He was so much fun in high school.
- Yeah.

54:55.060 --> 54:57.935
Yeah. You were fun
in high school too though.

54:58.019 --> 55:00.019
- Was I?
- Yeah.

55:00.102 --> 55:06.560
Yeah, I mean, there were things about you,
you know, that were fun, like when you...

55:07.602 --> 55:11.019
weren't being yourself.

55:12.268 --> 55:14.727
- I'm just kidding.
- Fuck you.

55:14.810 --> 55:17.226
I know. No, I just feel like...

55:18.310 --> 55:23.685
I feel like we had, like, a connection,
you know? At one time or another.

55:23.768 --> 55:27.393
- You think so?
- Yeah. Yeah.

55:27.476 --> 55:30.768
Like, we're both like these...

55:30.852 --> 55:33.810
very primal creatures, you know?

55:39.351 --> 55:41.810
What? What?

55:45.393 --> 55:47.351
What the fuck?

55:51.685 --> 55:53.852
What the fuck was that?

55:57.143 --> 56:01.019
What the fuck was that? Hey. Hey.

56:02.060 --> 56:06.268
Hey, what the fuck was that?
What did you do...? Why did you do that?

56:07.310 --> 56:10.019
Look at me. Did you want to kiss me?

56:10.101 --> 56:11.560
No.

56:12.768 --> 56:14.351
Fuck you.

56:17.226 --> 56:19.685
So, what did you think was gonna happen?

56:20.768 --> 56:24.727
Did you...? Like, you would seduce me
and we would fuck and then...?

56:24.810 --> 56:28.602
And then Kyle would just call off
the wedding?

56:28.685 --> 56:30.935
Is that what you thought?

56:31.019 --> 56:33.810
Yeah, like, hopefully.

56:34.810 --> 56:37.435
You dumb fuck.

56:39.852 --> 56:44.852
Because you know what? If we did have sex,
he wouldn't break up with me.

56:44.935 --> 56:46.518
He would break up with you.

56:47.560 --> 56:49.310
- You wanna fuck me? God!
- No.

56:49.393 --> 56:52.059
- No. No!
- You had me. You fucking kissed me.

56:52.143 --> 56:53.935
- Fuck me.
- I don't want to.

56:54.019 --> 56:55.977
Fuck you!

56:56.059 --> 57:00.602
Follow through with your master plan,
you sick fuck!

57:00.685 --> 57:04.518
- Fuck is wrong with you? Does that hurt?
- Fuck!

57:04.602 --> 57:09.518
We're just dead weight from his childhood
that he's too fucking nice to...

57:09.602 --> 57:11.935
Fuck off of me!

57:12.018 --> 57:17.393
You fat, sad, pathetic fuck! Fuck!

57:39.185 --> 57:41.852
What the fuck? What the fuck?

57:44.643 --> 57:47.852
You fuckers. What the fuck are you doing?

57:47.935 --> 57:52.518
Get the fuck off me!
Get the fuck off of me! You son of a...

57:57.268 --> 57:59.018
Shit, let go.

58:07.518 --> 58:09.018
Come on.

58:11.393 --> 58:13.059
Come on.

58:13.143 --> 58:15.602
Thank you very much! All right.

58:17.185 --> 58:18.393
Fuck!

58:18.477 --> 58:20.018
Come on.

58:22.852 --> 58:25.643
Fuck! Help! Help!

58:25.727 --> 58:29.101
Somebody help! Hey! Help!

58:30.143 --> 58:33.143
Help me! Help!

58:44.268 --> 58:45.852
Right here.

58:55.643 --> 58:58.477
Can we just take a break?
Can we take a break?

59:12.643 --> 59:14.101
Guys.

59:17.769 --> 59:20.352
Please. Please, guys.

59:20.435 --> 59:24.018
- Shut the fuck up.
- Okay. But please, listen.

59:24.101 --> 59:26.393
- I don't know what's going on...
- I said, shut up.

59:27.435 --> 59:28.934
Shut up.

59:30.185 --> 59:31.976
What are you doing?

59:32.060 --> 59:34.643
- What?
- Why are you doing that voice?

59:34.727 --> 59:36.101
To disguise my voice.

59:36.185 --> 59:39.769
Yeah, but I'm doing that voice,
so pick another voice.

59:39.852 --> 59:42.893
- It's just the Batman voice.
- Then stop doing it.

59:42.976 --> 59:45.143
I don't have another voice.

59:46.976 --> 59:48.934
Do a voice like this.
You could do this voice.

59:49.018 --> 59:51.143
That's perfect.
You do that, I'll do this one.

59:51.226 --> 59:56.143
No. I'm doing the Bat... I'm doing
the one I just showed you, I practiced it.

59:56.226 --> 59:59.560
- You do the one that I just did.
- I can't do that one.

59:59.644 --> 1:00:02.518
You're not even trying. Fine.

1:00:02.602 --> 1:00:03.644
I'll do this voice,

1:00:03.727 --> 1:00:06.560
- but this was why I wanted to prac...
- Mike?

1:00:06.644 --> 1:00:08.976
- Mike?
- No.

1:00:10.268 --> 1:00:12.060
It's you!

1:00:12.143 --> 1:00:14.934
- Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh.
- Goddamn it, Ronnie!

1:00:15.018 --> 1:00:17.101
- This is awesome. Hey, Ronnie.
- Hey.

1:00:17.185 --> 1:00:18.060
Stop laughing.

1:00:18.143 --> 1:00:21.727
That's why I wanted to do the guns.
It's so much scarier with the guns.

1:00:21.810 --> 1:00:23.644
This is great, guys.

1:00:24.644 --> 1:00:26.602
It's fucking ruined. It's ruined.

1:00:26.685 --> 1:00:31.769
No, it's not. It's great. Just keep going.
I'll go along with you. Keep going.

1:00:32.810 --> 1:00:33.851
Are you ready to die?

1:00:33.934 --> 1:00:37.101
No, Mike. Do it in the voice.
You gotta do it in the Batman voice.

1:00:38.101 --> 1:00:40.018
- Okay.
- Go, go, go.

1:00:40.101 --> 1:00:43.143
- Are you ready to die?
- No.

1:00:43.226 --> 1:00:45.310
Then I'll say, "Are you ready
to get fucked up?"

1:00:45.393 --> 1:00:46.976
No, don't fuck me up, man.

1:00:47.060 --> 1:00:51.518
Then I was gonna be like, "Are you ready
for the best bachelor party of your life?"

1:00:52.518 --> 1:00:54.226
Yes!

1:00:54.310 --> 1:00:55.976
Yes!

1:00:56.060 --> 1:00:58.310
This is awesome.

1:00:58.393 --> 1:01:01.935
Can you untie me though?
You guys did a really good job.

1:01:11.352 --> 1:01:12.644
What is that?

1:01:13.644 --> 1:01:16.851
We're ice fishing, man.
I gotta make this fun somehow.

1:01:16.935 --> 1:01:18.976
- No, I'm okay.
- Come on.

1:01:20.352 --> 1:01:23.893
I just wanna say thanks for setting this up.
I've always wanted to go ice fishing.

1:01:23.976 --> 1:01:28.435
Talk to him. He planned the whole thing.
Mike. I wanted to take you to AC.

1:01:28.518 --> 1:01:30.644
Still do the whole kidnapping thing,

1:01:30.727 --> 1:01:34.644
but when we took the hood off,
have it be at the strip club.

1:01:34.727 --> 1:01:37.060
It's not a bachelor party
without a stripper.

1:01:37.143 --> 1:01:38.560
I don't need a stripper, Uncle Mark.

1:01:38.644 --> 1:01:41.685
Kyle, it's not a bachelor party
without a stripper.

1:01:42.727 --> 1:01:45.060
Okay, I gotta go pee. Here.

1:01:56.352 --> 1:01:58.976
- He's a really good guy.
- Yeah.

1:01:59.976 --> 1:02:01.101
The best.

1:02:02.143 --> 1:02:04.143
It's too bad he's marrying my sister.

1:02:04.227 --> 1:02:08.143
I mean, don't get me wrong. I like her...
You know, I love her, obviously.

1:02:08.227 --> 1:02:12.393
But, yeah, it's too bad
he's marrying my sister.

1:02:12.477 --> 1:02:13.768
Yeah.

1:02:14.809 --> 1:02:16.602
He's a good guy.

1:02:21.143 --> 1:02:23.268
Oh, no, I'm okay. Yeah.

1:02:23.352 --> 1:02:25.310
- Hey, can you hold this?
- What's my name? Skip?

1:02:26.352 --> 1:02:28.976
- Oh, yeah, man.
- I want some cocaine.

1:02:29.060 --> 1:02:30.893
No, no. That's not coke.

1:02:30.976 --> 1:02:32.310
- Hey!
- Hi.

1:02:32.393 --> 1:02:35.976
- I'm looking for a bachelor party?
- Oh, yeah. It's right in there.

1:02:36.060 --> 1:02:38.018
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah.

1:02:39.185 --> 1:02:40.644
Mike.

1:02:52.352 --> 1:02:55.060
- Thanks for doing this.
- No problem.

1:03:03.602 --> 1:03:05.185
Listen...

1:03:06.352 --> 1:03:09.352
I've been thinking a lot about it,
with the wedding coming up.

1:03:10.684 --> 1:03:13.560
I don't have many friends
who know me, you know?

1:03:17.101 --> 1:03:19.519
And I gotta pick a best man.

1:03:20.976 --> 1:03:23.477
- So I was thinking...
- I slept with Marissa.

1:03:27.560 --> 1:03:29.060
Kyle, did you hear me?

1:03:29.143 --> 1:03:30.560
Yeah.

1:03:33.519 --> 1:03:36.726
I know this probably means
the end of the our friendship again.

1:03:38.393 --> 1:03:40.935
And you'll probably have
to call off the wedding.

1:03:44.143 --> 1:03:47.393
- I know it hurts right now, but maybe...
- Mike, shut the fuck up!

1:03:47.477 --> 1:03:49.726
Just shut up, okay?

1:03:50.851 --> 1:03:53.268
She told me what happened.

1:03:53.352 --> 1:03:55.310
She said you were drunk
and you made a sloppy move,

1:03:55.393 --> 1:03:57.018
and she called you fat and pathetic.

1:03:57.102 --> 1:03:59.684
- That's not what happened.
- I don't care what happened.

1:03:59.768 --> 1:04:02.060
If you love someone,
you should care what happened.

1:04:02.143 --> 1:04:04.060
Yeah, well, I don't!

1:04:05.143 --> 1:04:07.268
I'm done caring.

1:04:07.352 --> 1:04:10.185
I just want someone who wants to be with me.

1:04:11.227 --> 1:04:14.143
And start a family and be happy.

1:04:17.394 --> 1:04:19.477
You should still break up with her.

1:04:19.560 --> 1:04:21.435
You're a fucking idiot.

1:04:22.519 --> 1:04:24.976
You don't think I know what you're doing?

1:04:26.435 --> 1:04:28.935
I know you don't like her.
I know my mom and sisters don't.

1:04:29.018 --> 1:04:32.060
- Nobody likes her!
- Nobody likes you, Mike!

1:04:32.143 --> 1:04:33.810
I am the only one who likes you.

1:04:33.893 --> 1:04:36.643
And I don't know why
because you're fucking toxic.

1:04:37.684 --> 1:04:41.684
You're loud and obnoxious,
and you're an asshole!

1:04:42.726 --> 1:04:44.560
I know I'm an asshole.

1:04:45.810 --> 1:04:48.893
And I know no one likes me. I don't like me!

1:04:48.976 --> 1:04:50.643
Okay?

1:04:51.976 --> 1:04:54.935
Man, I'm not a happy person anymore.

1:04:55.018 --> 1:04:56.601
And that's okay.

1:04:57.601 --> 1:05:00.310
You know, but you're Kyle.
You're the best person I know.

1:05:00.394 --> 1:05:04.185
You make people around you happier
just by being yourself.

1:05:04.268 --> 1:05:09.851
I'm sorry if what I did killed a little bit
of that. But she's not right for you.

1:05:11.268 --> 1:05:14.185
And I'm not saying that
because I don't like her.

1:05:14.268 --> 1:05:17.559
Which I don't at all.

1:05:18.643 --> 1:05:21.268
She's not right for you because
she doesn't want you the way you are.

1:05:21.352 --> 1:05:23.893
She wants some other version of you

1:05:23.976 --> 1:05:26.935
that fits what she's looking for,
but fuck that!

1:05:27.018 --> 1:05:28.893
That's not what love's about.

1:05:29.893 --> 1:05:33.559
It's difficult and it's complicated.

1:05:33.643 --> 1:05:35.851
And it's painful.

1:05:36.893 --> 1:05:39.143
And it doesn't go away.

1:05:43.851 --> 1:05:46.435
Man, she's not good enough for you.

1:05:48.977 --> 1:05:51.227
And I'm not good enough for you.

1:05:53.851 --> 1:05:56.768
If I really cared about you,
I'd just leave you alone.

1:05:59.102 --> 1:06:01.268
- Kyle? Kyle?
- Help!

1:06:01.352 --> 1:06:02.726
- Holy shit! Kyle!
- Help me!

1:06:02.810 --> 1:06:05.268
- Help! Help!
- Hold on!

1:06:05.352 --> 1:06:06.851
Kyle!

1:06:34.435 --> 1:06:36.601
Kyle! Holy shit.

1:06:37.601 --> 1:06:40.643
Kyle! Kyle!

1:06:43.102 --> 1:06:44.768
Kyle!

1:06:46.269 --> 1:06:48.310
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

1:06:52.310 --> 1:06:54.143
Holy shit. Okay.

1:06:54.227 --> 1:06:55.893
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

1:06:56.893 --> 1:06:58.269
You're okay.

1:06:59.269 --> 1:07:00.643
Fuck.

1:07:01.935 --> 1:07:03.643
Holy shit.

1:07:08.685 --> 1:07:10.269
Oh, God.

1:07:17.102 --> 1:07:19.476
Hey, how much of that did you hear?

1:07:21.476 --> 1:07:23.269
What I was saying.

1:08:35.060 --> 1:08:37.310
Hey, Kyle. It's Michael.

1:08:38.310 --> 1:08:41.309
I'm not sure if you've been getting
any of my messages.

1:08:41.393 --> 1:08:44.852
But I was gonna see a movie later.

1:08:44.934 --> 1:08:46.642
Maybe tonight.

1:08:46.726 --> 1:08:49.643
Or now, if you wanted to come.

1:08:51.102 --> 1:08:53.226
I could also go tomorrow if you're free,

1:08:53.310 --> 1:08:56.643
but today's my birthday,
so I figured I would do that.

1:08:57.643 --> 1:09:01.725
So, yeah, call me back, man. All right, bye.

1:09:07.601 --> 1:09:09.767
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Marissa. It's Mike.

1:09:09.851 --> 1:09:13.517
Are you with Kyle? Because I've been trying
to get ahold of him and I...

1:09:13.601 --> 1:09:14.810
Hello?

1:09:15.893 --> 1:09:17.227
Hello?

1:09:20.559 --> 1:09:22.685
Get out of the road!

1:09:22.767 --> 1:09:24.935
Fucking asshole.

1:09:33.977 --> 1:09:36.518
Hey, can I get one ticket?

1:09:36.601 --> 1:09:38.185
Sure. For which movie?

1:09:39.184 --> 1:09:41.393
The one that's playing now, I guess.

1:09:41.476 --> 1:09:43.768
Okay. That'll be 7.50.

1:09:43.852 --> 1:09:46.893
Okay. Do you guys still have that thing
where it's free on your birthday?

1:09:46.977 --> 1:09:50.309
- Yeah.
- It's my birthday.

1:09:50.393 --> 1:09:52.308
- Can I see your license?
- Yeah.

1:09:52.393 --> 1:09:56.102
No, actually.
I don't have a license at the moment.

1:09:56.185 --> 1:09:57.977
It's a whole thing.

1:09:58.060 --> 1:10:01.935
We need some kind of ID
for the birthday special. Sorry.

1:10:02.018 --> 1:10:03.976
I've... I mean, I've got...

1:10:04.060 --> 1:10:05.560
I got, like, that.

1:10:06.560 --> 1:10:09.518
- I don't know if I can take this.
- It's a social security card.

1:10:09.601 --> 1:10:12.476
Yeah, but it's not a valid form of ID.

1:10:12.560 --> 1:10:17.768
- It's the most valid form of ID.
- It doesn't have your picture on it.

1:11:32.643 --> 1:11:34.893
Please join us in prayer.

1:11:35.935 --> 1:11:38.435
Be attentive to our prayers, O Lord.

1:11:38.518 --> 1:11:42.351
And in your kindness,
pour out your grace on these, your servants,

1:11:42.435 --> 1:11:44.143
Kyle and Marissa,

1:11:44.226 --> 1:11:47.143
that coming together before your altar,

1:11:47.226 --> 1:11:50.685
they may be confirmed in love
for one another

1:11:50.768 --> 1:11:54.268
through Christ, our Lord, amen.

1:11:54.351 --> 1:11:55.935
Amen.

1:11:56.019 --> 1:12:00.184
Thank you for joining us
in this joyous celebration.

1:12:00.268 --> 1:12:03.560
Now the groom's sisters, Bianca and Dana,

1:12:03.643 --> 1:12:07.435
will read from the book of Ephesians.

1:12:15.560 --> 1:12:18.060
I'm actually gonna read from Revelation.

1:12:18.143 --> 1:12:20.643
Chapter 2, verse 10.

1:12:21.643 --> 1:12:24.727
"Fear none of those things
which thou shalt suffer.

1:12:24.810 --> 1:12:30.143
Behold, the devil shall cast some of you
into prison that you may be tried.

1:12:30.226 --> 1:12:33.060
And ye shall have tribulation 10 days.

1:12:33.143 --> 1:12:38.226
Be thou faithful unto death
and I will give thee a crown of life."

1:12:41.768 --> 1:12:44.184
A reading from Ephesians.

1:12:44.268 --> 1:12:50.602
"Wives, submit yourselves
unto your own husbands as unto the Lord.

1:12:51.685 --> 1:12:54.727
For the husband is head of the wife,

1:12:54.810 --> 1:12:57.643
even as Christ is head of the church.

1:12:57.727 --> 1:13:01.226
And he is the savior of the body."

1:13:01.310 --> 1:13:03.060
Thank you, Your Honor.

1:13:03.143 --> 1:13:06.435
Through Christ, our Lord, amen.

1:13:06.518 --> 1:13:07.810
Amen.

1:13:08.810 --> 1:13:11.268
Please join us in prayer.

1:14:00.518 --> 1:14:02.143
Let's go.

1:14:19.935 --> 1:14:23.560
...and assume the responsibilities
of married life.

1:14:23.643 --> 1:14:25.768
- Oh, this is gonna be good.
- And in this church.

1:14:25.852 --> 1:14:27.643
I object.

1:14:27.727 --> 1:14:30.976
Excuse me, sir.
There's no objection in this ceremony.

1:14:31.059 --> 1:14:34.393
- I'm sorry, Father. He's my best friend.
- Sir, get out of my church!

1:14:34.477 --> 1:14:36.685
- Wait a second, let him speak.
- Oh, boy.

1:14:36.769 --> 1:14:38.560
- Don't marry her, Kyle.
- No!

1:14:38.643 --> 1:14:43.351
No, no, no!

1:14:43.435 --> 1:14:45.059
- Let me go!
- Hey.

1:14:45.143 --> 1:14:46.351
- It's okay.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1:14:46.435 --> 1:14:47.976
- Oh, my God. Your veil.
- This is my wedding!

1:14:48.059 --> 1:14:49.351
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1:14:49.435 --> 1:14:52.351
Sometimes you get knocked down,
you got to get right back in there.

1:14:52.435 --> 1:14:54.101
- Fuck is he doing wearing white?
- Mike!

1:14:54.185 --> 1:14:55.310
Kyle.

1:14:56.393 --> 1:14:58.351
What are you doing, man?

1:14:59.477 --> 1:15:02.518
You deserve to be with someone
who loves you...

1:15:03.560 --> 1:15:05.976
for who you are.

1:15:06.059 --> 1:15:08.185
This beautiful man.

1:15:09.185 --> 1:15:11.018
You're a beautiful man.

1:15:12.101 --> 1:15:13.310
And I love you.

1:15:14.310 --> 1:15:16.185
And so does everyone here.

1:15:16.268 --> 1:15:18.477
Or at least the people on this side.

1:15:19.769 --> 1:15:21.727
I just don't think she loves you.

1:15:21.810 --> 1:15:22.934
Kyle.

1:15:23.018 --> 1:15:24.393
I love you.

1:15:24.477 --> 1:15:28.185
- Maybe, but you definitely don't love her...
- Mike, shut up.

1:15:29.185 --> 1:15:30.477
Wait.

1:15:31.477 --> 1:15:34.560
- Do you love me?
- Yes.

1:15:34.643 --> 1:15:36.226
Why do you love me?

1:15:36.310 --> 1:15:38.018
Because...

1:15:39.101 --> 1:15:42.852
Because you're driven
and because you always get what you want.

1:15:42.934 --> 1:15:45.351
And you never listen when people say no.

1:15:45.435 --> 1:15:50.310
You're always pushing me to do things that
I don't wanna do and constantly change...

1:15:50.393 --> 1:15:52.602
That...? That's why?

1:15:52.685 --> 1:15:56.685
Do you really think
that this is my master plan?

1:15:56.769 --> 1:16:00.852
That I wanted to get married to the guy
that I broke up with after high school?

1:16:00.934 --> 1:16:03.018
Because it's not.

1:16:03.101 --> 1:16:06.643
But I don't know what I want
and I don't know what I need,

1:16:06.727 --> 1:16:10.518
but I do know that I love you.

1:16:10.602 --> 1:16:14.769
And I didn't expect to, but I do.

1:16:14.852 --> 1:16:16.810
You didn't let me finish.

1:16:17.810 --> 1:16:20.477
I was trying to say that all those things...

1:16:20.560 --> 1:16:22.518
that's what I need.

1:16:23.643 --> 1:16:25.018
I love that you push me

1:16:25.101 --> 1:16:29.101
because it makes me change
and otherwise I'd stay the same.

1:16:30.101 --> 1:16:32.268
And I don't wanna stay the same.

1:16:34.893 --> 1:16:38.644
And you're so funny and beautiful.

1:16:45.810 --> 1:16:47.268
I love you.

1:16:47.352 --> 1:16:49.018
I love you too.

1:16:50.018 --> 1:16:50.976
Hey, can I just say...?

1:16:51.060 --> 1:16:52.685
- No.
- Mike.

1:16:52.769 --> 1:16:56.101
- Because I had a whole...
- I'm pregnant. We're getting married.

1:17:00.018 --> 1:17:02.018
Oh, my God.

1:17:02.101 --> 1:17:03.851
A baby?

1:17:05.934 --> 1:17:07.685
Just go.

1:17:16.727 --> 1:17:19.851
Grandma Suzi.

1:17:19.935 --> 1:17:22.435
- That was awesome.
- Thanks.

1:17:22.518 --> 1:17:24.018
I knew she was pregnant.

1:17:24.101 --> 1:17:27.393
- I think we need to take a moment...
- No, no, no.

1:17:27.477 --> 1:17:28.976
We're good. We're ready.

1:17:29.060 --> 1:17:32.018
Matrimony demands full consent
from both parties.

1:17:32.101 --> 1:17:33.518
We consent. Kyle, do you consent?

1:17:33.602 --> 1:17:34.602
- I do.
- Great.

1:17:34.685 --> 1:17:38.685
I'm going to insist that we hold off on this
until you both have had a chance

1:17:38.769 --> 1:17:42.727
to think about this incredible decision
you're going to make.

1:17:42.809 --> 1:17:45.185
- Are you serious?
- Oh, I am serious.

1:17:45.268 --> 1:17:47.518
Fifty-one percent of marriages
end in divorce,

1:17:47.602 --> 1:17:50.435
and pregnancy can create undue pressure.

1:17:50.518 --> 1:17:54.893
I encourage both of you to consider
the magnitude of this decision

1:17:54.976 --> 1:18:00.185
so you may return here without coercion,
freely and wholeheartedly.

1:18:00.268 --> 1:18:01.851
When?

1:18:03.268 --> 1:18:05.685
After the child's born.

1:18:06.727 --> 1:18:08.143
What the fuck?

1:18:09.143 --> 1:18:10.893
Sorry, Father.

1:18:12.018 --> 1:18:13.602
Shit.

1:19:02.101 --> 1:19:04.560
Hey, Mike. You know
how much longer it's gonna be?

1:19:04.644 --> 1:19:07.809
I'm repairing a bike, Gary.
This isn't McDonald's.

1:19:07.893 --> 1:19:09.477
Word.

1:19:13.768 --> 1:19:16.227
Where have you been riding this thing?
It's all corroded.

1:19:16.310 --> 1:19:18.352
It looks like it's been in the ocean.

1:19:19.352 --> 1:19:22.101
You know, mostly I take it on the bike path.

1:19:22.185 --> 1:19:25.851
But, yeah, I've been going
down to the beach lately.

1:19:25.935 --> 1:19:29.393
Trying to meet people since my mom passed.

1:19:29.477 --> 1:19:31.352
You know, it's a talk thing.

1:19:31.435 --> 1:19:34.310
Like, people, you know, bring their dogs
and you talk about the dog.

1:19:34.393 --> 1:19:35.768
- Hey.
- You're like, "Look at my bike.

1:19:35.851 --> 1:19:37.768
Is that a pink bike? That's good exercise..."

1:19:37.851 --> 1:19:39.560
Gary, I have a customer.

1:19:40.560 --> 1:19:42.268
Yeah, sure.

1:19:44.060 --> 1:19:45.310
What do you want?

1:19:46.310 --> 1:19:48.477
Can I get a cappuccino?

1:19:48.560 --> 1:19:50.060
Sure.

1:20:07.810 --> 1:20:09.851
Are you looking to buy a bike?

1:20:11.102 --> 1:20:12.602
No.

1:20:24.310 --> 1:20:26.227
He misses you.

1:20:27.935 --> 1:20:30.393
- I'm sorry, what?
- He misses you.

1:20:52.185 --> 1:20:53.477
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1:20:53.560 --> 1:20:56.143
- How much do I owe you?
- It's on me.

1:20:56.227 --> 1:20:58.643
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1:20:59.768 --> 1:21:02.893
Hey, if you're handing out
free 'puccinos, I'll take one.

1:21:02.976 --> 1:21:04.893
You know if your...?
Is your bathroom working?

1:21:04.976 --> 1:21:06.726
Gary, please go outside.

1:21:06.810 --> 1:21:09.560
- Okay. Yeah, no problem, man.
- Out.

1:21:13.352 --> 1:21:15.060
Why are you here?

1:21:15.143 --> 1:21:17.976
- Hey.
- Just wanted to talk to you.

1:21:20.227 --> 1:21:21.976
If I were you...

1:21:39.559 --> 1:21:41.601
You want a cowboy?

1:21:49.935 --> 1:21:51.435
So cute.

1:21:52.435 --> 1:21:54.018
You want this?

1:21:55.185 --> 1:21:58.060
I know. That's what I was saying.

1:21:59.060 --> 1:22:00.643
Saying:

1:22:03.935 --> 1:22:06.018
- Hey, trade?
- Yeah.

1:22:09.893 --> 1:22:12.810
- Here's the cactus.
- Thank you. Cactus.

1:22:12.893 --> 1:22:15.601
Oh, shit. I forgot my card in there.

1:22:15.685 --> 1:22:17.977
- Can you grab it for me?
- Sure.

1:23:07.726 --> 1:23:11.851
<i>"People are not lazy.
They simply have impotent goals."</i>

1:23:11.935 --> 1:23:14.269
What does "impotent" mean?

1:23:15.269 --> 1:23:19.143
It means that you can't, like...

1:23:19.227 --> 1:23:22.018
That you have trouble doing something,
you know?

1:23:23.018 --> 1:23:27.352
"A real decision is measured by the fact
that you've taken a new action

1:23:27.435 --> 1:23:30.643
and that there's no action
you haven't truly decided."

1:23:30.726 --> 1:23:33.518
- Hey, baby, did you finish your homework?
- No, not yet.

1:23:33.601 --> 1:23:37.434
Okay, well, maybe what we can do
is finish your homework

1:23:37.518 --> 1:23:41.102
and then we can get back
to reading Tony Robbins, okay?

1:23:41.185 --> 1:23:42.434
- Okay.
- Okay.

1:23:42.518 --> 1:23:44.768
Do you want one pancake or two?

1:23:45.810 --> 1:23:47.434
- One pancake or two?
- One.

1:23:47.518 --> 1:23:49.143
One.

1:23:49.227 --> 1:23:50.394
Okay.

1:23:51.394 --> 1:23:53.394
Just one for you.

1:23:54.394 --> 1:23:55.352
Four for me.

1:23:56.394 --> 1:23:57.643
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1:23:57.726 --> 1:23:59.935
- Mom!
- Sorry.

1:24:00.018 --> 1:24:01.060
- Sorry.
- Okay.

1:24:01.143 --> 1:24:03.310
- Sorry.
- All right.

1:24:03.394 --> 1:24:05.018
Sorry.

1:24:06.851 --> 1:24:08.185
This one didn't break.

1:24:09.185 --> 1:24:10.269
Great.

1:24:10.352 --> 1:24:12.685
I'll get it. I'll clean it up.

1:24:16.810 --> 1:24:20.560
- I'll get some glue or something.
- All right.

1:24:45.810 --> 1:24:49.102
Hey, what did we say about the glasses?

1:24:50.102 --> 1:24:55.351
We said that I get the glassware
and you get the plates.

1:24:57.269 --> 1:24:59.351
- Is that cool?
- Yeah.

1:25:23.893 --> 1:25:25.726
Hey, you gotta move your truck, man.

1:25:25.810 --> 1:25:28.310
Okay, hold on. Yeah, give me a second.

1:25:33.726 --> 1:25:35.269
Hey, stop beeping your fucking horn!

1:25:35.351 --> 1:25:37.852
- Hey, you need to move your truck.
- Go around!

1:25:38.852 --> 1:25:41.018
Don't you move this car.

1:25:43.102 --> 1:25:44.935
I said, stop beeping your fucking horn!

1:25:45.018 --> 1:25:47.685
- Move your truck!
- Fuck you!

1:25:50.935 --> 1:25:54.893
Hey, buddy! There's no chance
in fucking hell I'm moving this truck now!

1:25:54.977 --> 1:25:58.185
Hey! Stop beeping your fucking horn!

1:25:58.269 --> 1:26:00.518
Really? Really? Come on, motherfucker.

1:26:00.601 --> 1:26:02.435
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Come on!

1:26:02.518 --> 1:26:04.768
- Come on!
- No, no. Look, man, I'm fucking sorry.

1:26:04.852 --> 1:26:06.435
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

1:26:06.518 --> 1:26:09.726
You fuck! Move the fucking truck!

1:26:09.810 --> 1:26:11.643
Asshole!

1:26:11.726 --> 1:26:13.435
- You got something to say?
- Nothing, no.

1:26:13.518 --> 1:26:15.935
- You wanna say something?
- Nothing. I got nothing.

1:26:17.351 --> 1:26:20.018
Fucking motherfucker.

1:26:22.852 --> 1:26:24.643
Kyle, I'll be right back!

1:26:24.727 --> 1:26:26.351
Okay!

1:26:35.227 --> 1:26:36.977
What's going on?

1:26:38.018 --> 1:26:40.601
- Driving school.
- Oh, Jesus.

1:26:41.601 --> 1:26:44.102
Sorry. Mike broke a plate.

1:26:44.185 --> 1:26:45.893
Okay.

1:26:52.102 --> 1:26:53.977
It's a great house.

1:26:56.185 --> 1:26:57.601
Yeah.

1:27:10.185 --> 1:27:13.560
Listen, I'm gonna talk to Otis's teacher
about the whole math thing.

1:27:13.643 --> 1:27:14.727
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

1:27:14.810 --> 1:27:18.309
I e-mailed her,
but it will be good if you talk to her

1:27:18.393 --> 1:27:20.768
because, you know, she likes you better.

1:27:35.226 --> 1:27:38.601
Sorry. The horn's like...

1:27:39.643 --> 1:27:41.060
Let's go.

1:27:59.184 --> 1:28:00.685
I'll see you.

1:28:06.601 --> 1:28:09.310
Hey, Mike, can you...? I got it, I got it.

1:28:09.393 --> 1:28:11.310
Can you just hold on to these?

1:28:11.393 --> 1:28:13.810
Mike, the car. Mike, the car!

1:28:13.893 --> 1:28:14.977
Sorry.

1:28:15.060 --> 1:28:18.060
You got to put the brake on, man.

1:28:23.184 --> 1:28:24.560
Bye.

1:28:26.184 --> 1:28:28.476
Why do you still have tapes?

1:28:32.019 --> 1:28:33.560
Dad!

1:28:35.019 --> 1:28:38.351
- Careful!
- Dad, wait for me!

1:28:39.893 --> 1:28:41.977
Dad, wait!

1:28:43.560 --> 1:28:45.268
Dad!

1:28:57.435 --> 1:29:00.935
- Hey.
- Dad, why didn't you wait for me?

1:29:01.019 --> 1:29:04.476
The house is, like, three houses down.

1:29:04.560 --> 1:29:07.977
You're okay. Don't worry.
You got some chocolate on your face.

1:29:08.060 --> 1:29:11.810
I read that 70 percent of long-term
prison inmates are a product of divorce.

1:29:11.894 --> 1:29:14.602
- That's not funny.
- I agree. It's not funny at all.

1:29:14.685 --> 1:29:15.894
It's tragic.

1:29:15.977 --> 1:29:17.560
- How you doing?
- Good.

1:29:17.643 --> 1:29:19.060
Good.

1:29:19.143 --> 1:29:20.977
You're riding great.

1:29:23.143 --> 1:29:25.351
Those training wheels are slowing him down.
You know that, right?

1:29:25.435 --> 1:29:27.184
He needs them.

1:29:27.268 --> 1:29:29.768
He wouldn't need them
if you taught him how to ride a bike.

1:29:29.852 --> 1:29:32.476
Mike, we talked about this.
You don't get a say.

1:29:32.560 --> 1:29:36.268
I'm not trying to get a say. I'm just saying
that, like, he's a natural athlete, and...

1:29:36.351 --> 1:29:40.184
Listen, I already made a decision.
It's his choice.

1:29:42.143 --> 1:29:43.143
Hey, Otis.

1:29:43.226 --> 1:29:46.351
Wanna take those training wheels off
and ride a bike like an actual person?

1:29:46.435 --> 1:29:48.019
Yeah.

1:29:49.393 --> 1:29:51.019
Okay, fine.

1:29:51.101 --> 1:29:52.435
- You want to?
- Yeah.

1:29:52.518 --> 1:29:54.977
All right. Here we go. Let's pull over.

1:29:55.059 --> 1:29:56.852
Here you go. Stop, stop, stop.

1:29:56.935 --> 1:29:59.435
Yeah, there you go. Okay.

1:30:13.935 --> 1:30:16.768
Fuck. Goddamn it.

1:30:16.852 --> 1:30:18.226
Dad!

1:30:18.310 --> 1:30:19.852
Sorry.

1:30:25.727 --> 1:30:28.268
- You want some help with this?
- No, I got it.

1:30:29.685 --> 1:30:31.101
God!

1:30:35.226 --> 1:30:37.810
- Kyle, I have a tool.
- No, I got it.

1:30:40.143 --> 1:30:41.477
All right.

1:30:44.435 --> 1:30:46.101
Okay, Otis.

1:30:52.059 --> 1:30:57.518
All right, so riding a bike is just like
riding a bike with training wheels, okay?

1:30:57.602 --> 1:30:59.894
You just look straight ahead,
don't look down.

1:30:59.977 --> 1:31:03.602
And if you get freaked out,
you just put your feet down and stop, okay?

1:31:03.685 --> 1:31:05.101
- Okay.
- All right.

1:31:05.185 --> 1:31:08.059
Go ahead and get on.
And don't be scared, okay?

1:31:08.143 --> 1:31:09.852
- I'm not scared.
- Okay.

1:31:09.935 --> 1:31:12.477
I'm just saying,
if you are scared, that's okay.

1:31:12.560 --> 1:31:14.560
- I'm not.
- Okay.

1:31:14.643 --> 1:31:17.643
Hey, Otis, when you crash,
just get back on the bike, you know?

1:31:17.727 --> 1:31:19.018
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:31:19.101 --> 1:31:21.769
He's gonna crash so he should know
what to do when that happens.

1:31:21.852 --> 1:31:23.351
Why are you putting it in his head?

1:31:23.435 --> 1:31:27.435
I'm not. I'm just telling him
so he has an understanding... He's riding.

1:31:27.518 --> 1:31:30.685
- Otis! Otis, keep pedaling! Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit.

1:31:32.685 --> 1:31:35.435
- Otis, are you hurt? Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1:31:35.518 --> 1:31:37.059
- Which one?
- I'm okay.

1:31:37.143 --> 1:31:38.727
Okay.

1:31:40.518 --> 1:31:41.976
Okay.

1:31:42.059 --> 1:31:43.268
Now, listen, man.

1:31:43.351 --> 1:31:47.268
Sometimes in life,
we fall down and it hurts, okay?

1:31:47.351 --> 1:31:50.101
But that's when it's important for us
to get back on the bike and ride.

1:31:50.185 --> 1:31:52.976
I know. Uncle Mike just said that.

1:31:54.769 --> 1:31:57.351
- Hey, Otis. You want some more Orangina?
- No, I'm good.

1:31:57.435 --> 1:31:59.477
- Okay.
- Just take it easy, okay?

1:31:59.560 --> 1:32:01.934
Just take a moment.

1:32:02.018 --> 1:32:04.310
God, this is so stressful.

1:32:06.685 --> 1:32:08.435
He's fine, I'm telling you.
Oh, he's going again.

1:32:08.518 --> 1:32:10.268
Oh, shit. Okay.

1:32:11.268 --> 1:32:14.185
- He's going!
- You're doing great! Keep pedaling!

1:32:14.268 --> 1:32:17.226
- You're doing great, Otis!
- Oh, my gosh. He is doing great.

1:32:17.310 --> 1:32:20.143
- Holy shit, he's going really fast.
- He's going really fast.

1:32:23.560 --> 1:32:26.185
- Great work, Otis.
- Great work.

1:32:29.602 --> 1:32:32.643
- He's got a great cadence, you know?
- Yeah.

1:32:32.727 --> 1:32:34.393
- Takes after...
- Mike, stop.

1:32:34.477 --> 1:32:36.852
I'm just saying, he's a natural athlete.

1:32:36.934 --> 1:32:38.268
That has to be genetic.

1:32:38.352 --> 1:32:42.310
Just keep pedaling. Stay to the side
so Mom doesn't get mad at me.

1:32:42.393 --> 1:32:44.101
There you go.

1:32:44.185 --> 1:32:45.976
Look at you!

1:32:46.060 --> 1:32:49.518
Look at you! This is amazing.

1:32:50.643 --> 1:32:52.185
Oh, yeah.

1:32:55.602 --> 1:32:57.934
- I could do a high five.
- High-fiving Mike?

1:32:58.018 --> 1:32:59.852
That was a close one! No high-fiving.

1:32:59.934 --> 1:33:02.060
- Let's go. Keep going.
- Keep going, we gotta push it!

1:33:02.143 --> 1:33:03.810
Out of the saddle! Out of the saddle!

1:33:03.893 --> 1:33:07.143
- Push! Mush, mush, mush!
- I got it.
