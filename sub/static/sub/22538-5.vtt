it's Brother Lovebutter.

00:05.038 --> 00:07.006
Today I'm weeping.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.907
I weep at a life lost too young.

00:09.943 --> 00:13.003
As we say goodbye,
let's hope the soul of our beloved

00:13.046 --> 00:15.537

Better call up a plumber

To turn on the steam pump
to cool me off

00:27.727 --> 00:30.161

Somebody's going to hell for this.
They threw a 9-year-old girl off the roof.

Nine!

00:38.238 --> 00:42.106
-Her name is Keisha Davies.
-Lowlife even tore her dress, boss.

00:42.142 --> 00:44.235
Someone who kills a kid...

00:45.078 --> 00:47.774
Someone who kills a kid needs killing.

(SINGING) The sandman's coming
from a distant star

00:52.085 --> 00:54.280

00:54.320 --> 00:55.378
I know this girl.

00:55.422 --> 00:59.324
You might've bought lemonade
from her. She had a stand sometimes.

00:59.359 --> 01:04.126
It wasn't really good. It was tart.
But she was so sweet.

01:06.366 --> 01:09.062
I actually met Keisha riding her bike.

01:09.569 --> 01:14.438
She helped me
with something important.

01:15.008 --> 01:16.805
RAY: I got the bull's-eye on the suspect.

01:16.843 --> 01:21.075
It's a scuzzball briar-breaker
named Angel Ramirez. Puerto Rican.

01:21.714 --> 01:24.148
Now, two witnesses hanging laundry
on the opposite roof,

01:24.184 --> 01:26.414
they saw Angel toss Keisha off.

01:26.453 --> 01:29.422
And that just turns the situation
from bedlam into mayhem.

a black girl off a roof?

01:33.226 --> 01:36.627
I don't know how it is in Hyde,
but here, PRs and blacks,

01:36.663 --> 01:38.528
there's an ongoing hostility.

01:38.565 --> 01:41.329
This would be like my sister-in-law
eating a cheesecake.

01:41.367 --> 01:43.858
Gonna get real ugly, real fast.

01:44.504 --> 01:47.234
-We got any leads on Angel?
-Yeah, Chris is bringing him in.

01:47.273 --> 01:50.333
I'm jealous of him. He gets to play
boot-and-rally on the dirtbag.

01:50.376 --> 01:51.707
Who is this Angel Ramirez?

01:51.744 --> 01:54.907
He was the building super.
He did two years for assault.

01:54.948 --> 01:59.408
Apparently, Keisha used to watch him
fixing the windows, mopping the floors.

01:59.452 --> 02:03.252
The neighbors said Angel used to call
Keisha his assistant mop supervisor.

02:03.289 --> 02:06.725
Boss, Chris ran into a snag
trying to pick up Angel.

02:20.073 --> 02:24.032
I chased him into the church,
but Father Tim here won't let me in.

02:24.077 --> 02:26.477
You wear a badge, Chris.
A badge overrides cloth.

02:26.513 --> 02:29.778
Father, Angel Ramirez is a suspect
in a murder, okay?

02:29.816 --> 02:31.807
We need to take him into custody.

02:31.851 --> 02:34.752
Ray, who is this clown?
Does he know I used to box?

02:34.787 --> 02:37.779
Father Tim, Sam Tyler. He's new.

02:37.824 --> 02:41.487
Hello, Sam Tyler. Words like "need"
aren't used with priests.

02:41.528 --> 02:46.192
Father, Angel Ramirez
chucked a little girl off a roof.

02:46.232 --> 02:50.464
Now the last thing he deserves
is mercy. Kill my dog, I'll slay your cat.

Now that has a biblical charm even you
pinguinis can appreciate. Come on.

02:54.974 --> 02:57.636
Look, if he's innocent,
then he's got nothing to worry about.

02:57.677 --> 03:00.703
If he's guilty, then he should
make peace with your God.

03:00.747 --> 03:02.612
My God? Not yours?

03:03.983 --> 03:05.974
No, not for a long time.

03:06.352 --> 03:09.549
Give us Angel, we'll do our best.

Be fair with him.

Be fair, or I'll hit you with so many
rights, you'll beg me for the left.

The word from you people
on the street

is that the police have lost Angel.

04:47.153 --> 04:52.147
And since Angel's spread his wings,
if you can hear me, Angel,

04:52.191 --> 04:57.390
you can hear the people talking.
