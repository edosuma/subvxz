[indistinct chatter]

00:36.244 --> 00:38.455
Just keep on smiling at me.

00:40.331 --> 00:41.833
{\an8}[chatter continues]

00:42.959 --> 00:45.795
I was here when your daddy was.
He was a good guy.

[Chris Holbrook] <i>We love to get</i>
<i>back together and see each other.</i>

00:48.298 --> 00:51.468
Football team, 1962-63.

00:51.551 --> 00:52.969
[interviewer] You played under Bull?

00:53.052 --> 00:55.013
Under Coach Sullivan, yes.

00:55.096 --> 00:57.849
{\an8}-I wouldn't say "Bull," but I can say...
-[all laughing]

00:57.932 --> 01:00.518
{\an8}Even if he's gone,
I wouldn't say "Bull."

01:00.602 --> 01:02.437
{\an8}I respect him that much, I'll tell you.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.147
{\an8}[George Cummings] <i>And he was</i>
<i>a heck of a coach, you know.</i>

01:04.230 --> 01:05.648
{\an8}And he was, uh, tough.

01:06.983 --> 01:10.904
{\an8}Tough guy... but, uh, he got results.

01:10.987 --> 01:12.822
{\an8}[chuckles] You know.

01:12.906 --> 01:16.284
[stadium announcer speaking indistinctly]

01:27.045 --> 01:29.589
{\an8}[alumnus 1] <i>People that didn't know</i>
<i>Coach Sullivan thought he was crazy.</i>

01:29.672 --> 01:32.217
{\an8}[alumnus 2] <i>He treated us</i>
<i>like military recruits, and it was...</i>

01:32.300 --> 01:33.343
{\an8}<i>it was tough.</i>

01:33.426 --> 01:34.511
{\an8}[alumnus 3] <i>He'd been at war,</i>

01:34.594 --> 01:36.513
<i>and he knew what it would take</i>
<i>to get us in shape</i>

01:36.596 --> 01:38.264
<i>and to be better</i>
<i>than what we really were.</i>

01:39.224 --> 01:41.810
[Vic Sullivan] <i>I think it was like</i>
<i>him preparing them for battle.</i>

01:41.893 --> 01:43.770
{\an8}He had to gain their respect.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.820
{\an8}I've recently been diagnosed
with Parkinson's.

01:51.903 --> 01:54.489
{\an8}And I said, "You know,
if I can live through two years...

01:54.572 --> 01:55.990
{\an8}at Scooba with Coach Sullivan,

01:56.074 --> 01:58.827
{\an8}that this Parkinson's would be
a walk in the park."

01:59.661 --> 02:02.705
<i>I've got my helmet</i>
<i>and I went to the manager and said,</i>

02:02.789 --> 02:05.917
"Where do I get my facemask?"
And he starts laughing.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.919
[Vic] <i>I can't imagine getting down,</i>
<i>looking across at somebody,</i>

02:09.002 --> 02:10.922
<i>you know, and you're looking</i>
<i>at their cross-bone skull</i>

02:11.005 --> 02:12.549
and no facemask.

02:12.632 --> 02:15.051
You know they're tough.
[laughs]

02:15.135 --> 02:16.136
{\an8}We bought into that...

02:16.219 --> 02:18.638
{\an8}Let me say, I say we bought into it.
We didn't have a choice.

02:18.721 --> 02:19.889
{\an8}[laughs]

02:20.890 --> 02:24.727
<i>One of our defensive backs got hit</i>
<i>right in the face, slugged.</i>

02:24.811 --> 02:28.022
Coach Sullivan said,
"Did you see that SOB? Let's get him!"

02:28.106 --> 02:30.233
Bench emptied, you know, just a big brawl.

02:30.316 --> 02:32.986
[J.K. Briggs Jr.]
<i>If you wanna fight, he'd let you fight.</i>

02:33.069 --> 02:36.156
{\an8}Then he'd turn the energy
around on that football field

02:36.239 --> 02:40.952
{\an8}and get more out of you
than you knew you could do yourself.

02:42.120 --> 02:45.290
[Rick Cleveland]
<i>There was a plane flying over practice,</i>

02:45.373 --> 02:47.167
<i>and all of a sudden,</i>
<i>Bull got the gun</i>

02:47.250 --> 02:49.377
{\an8}and started shooting up
at the plane and yelling,

02:49.460 --> 02:53.548
{\an8}"Decatur spies! Decatur spies!
They're spying on our practice!"

02:53.631 --> 02:55.842
You know, he said,
"Shoot first and then ask questions."

02:55.925 --> 02:57.510
[laughs]

02:58.803 --> 03:02.724
[Charlie Studdard] <i>There's a statue of him</i>
<i>on the north end of the football field.</i>

03:02.807 --> 03:04.601
{\an8}It looks so much like him, it's scary.

03:04.684 --> 03:06.519
{\an8}[stammers] I'm afraid he's gonna
throw his clipboard,

03:06.603 --> 03:09.981
<i>or do something when we walk by there.</i>

03:11.733 --> 03:13.192

03:13.276 --> 03:16.487
[Buddy] <i>God damn it! Hey!</i>
<i>You gotta get back, Taylor!</i>

03:16.571 --> 03:18.656
<i>You gotta get back!</i>

03:18.740 --> 03:21.075
[coach] All right. Ready!

03:21.159 --> 03:22.952
Get back! Get him!
Push Ollie down!

03:23.036 --> 03:26.289
[blows whistle] Damn it, Rose.
Don't block a man!

03:26.372 --> 03:28.958
Hey! Everybody get on the side.
[blows whistle]

03:29.042 --> 03:30.126
Everybody get on the side.
Hurry up!

03:30.209 --> 03:31.794
-[man] Let's go! Let's go!
-Hurry up!

03:32.420 --> 03:34.964
[Buddy] Over and back, everybody!
[blows whistle] Go!

03:36.299 --> 03:37.967
[Wood] Come on, come on, come on!

03:38.051 --> 03:39.802
Let's go! Let's go!

03:39.886 --> 03:41.095
[Buddy] Pick it up!

03:41.179 --> 03:42.180
Or I swear by...

03:42.263 --> 03:44.933
I swear by the lives
of my three daughters,

03:45.016 --> 03:47.018
I will run the shit out of you.

03:47.101 --> 03:50.146
You think I'm bullshittin'?
I ain't bullshittin'!

03:50.230 --> 03:52.774
-[whistle blows]
-You're gonna make this hard on you.

03:52.857 --> 03:56.194
I ain't gonna make it hard on you.
You gonna make it hard on you.

03:56.277 --> 03:57.654
Pick it up!

04:03.076 --> 04:04.577
{\an8}Ollie, you gotta get in shape.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.706
{\an8}[Wagner] <i>Obviously, the kid wants to play.</i>
<i>I don't blame him.</i>

04:08.790 --> 04:11.542
<i>They took him to the second doctor</i>
<i>this morning in Tuscaloosa.</i>

04:11.626 --> 04:13.544
Hopefully, he'll be fine and...

04:15.380 --> 04:17.714
you know, everyone will be over it,

04:17.798 --> 04:19.132
<i>and we'll just move on.</i>

04:19.216 --> 04:21.427
<i>But you gotta figure 'em all out.</i>

04:21.511 --> 04:24.430
<i>Sometimes we do a great job at that,</i>
<i>sometimes we suck.</i>

04:24.514 --> 04:26.849
[chuckles] <i>Myself included.</i>

04:26.933 --> 04:28.309
[Buddy] Football may not be for you, baby.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.687
It's okay.
[yells] It's okay!

04:30.812 --> 04:32.146
-[player yells]
-Hey!

04:32.230 --> 04:34.941
If football ain't for you, it's okay!

04:35.024 --> 04:36.567
[player] Boys, quit being lazy.
Let's go!

04:36.651 --> 04:38.278
[Buddy] Don't play!

04:39.612 --> 04:42.282
If football does not mean
that much to you, don't play.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.325
-Please!
-Oh, my fucking God.

04:44.409 --> 04:45.743
[Buddy] It's okay!

04:45.827 --> 04:47.620
Your mom will understand!

04:47.704 --> 04:48.830
I promise.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.833
You can stay at the house.

04:51.916 --> 04:55.044
[Ollie] That's that dumb shit.
[player] I was running last night.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.505
Man, we ran about 20 last night.

04:57.588 --> 04:59.173
[mutters]

05:00.591 --> 05:02.260
[Ollie] <i>It's been rough.</i>

05:02.343 --> 05:03.886
<i>Been a rough week.</i>

05:03.970 --> 05:06.347
<i>It is what it is, I guess.</i>

05:06.431 --> 05:08.141
I'm here now.
I finna' graduate in December.

05:08.224 --> 05:10.768
I can't just... [mumbling]
I can't quit now.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.188
I gotta play next week, though.

05:14.272 --> 05:17.608
I ain't gonna plan on missing next week...
at all.

05:19.402 --> 05:21.321
Can't miss next week.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.197
[Buddy yelling] <i>You think I'm joking?</i>

05:23.281 --> 05:25.366
That's the reason you get your ass beat!

05:26.409 --> 05:28.661
Because you don't worry about
the little things!

05:28.745 --> 05:31.456
-Ready!
-[whistle blows]

05:31.539 --> 05:32.999
[players panting]

[Matt Pellegrin]
<i>We're the Digital Media department.</i>

05:53.978 --> 05:55.188
<i>I'm the director of Digital Media.</i>

05:55.271 --> 05:56.814
<i>Matt is the assistant director</i>
<i>of Digital Media.</i>

05:56.898 --> 06:00.068
{\an8}We produce, um,
commercials for the school.

06:00.151 --> 06:02.820
{\an8}We produce hype videos for the team.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.363
<i>To win a National Championship,</i>

06:04.447 --> 06:06.949
<i>you have to be ranked number one</i>
<i>or number two in the nation.</i>

06:07.033 --> 06:09.744
<i>Co-Lin is still ranked, uh, number one,</i>
<i>after defeating us,</i>

06:09.827 --> 06:12.580
<i>but until you get that second loss,</i>

06:12.663 --> 06:13.915
<i>-there's always hope.</i>
-[Milner] <i>Yeah.</i>

06:13.998 --> 06:17.168
<i>Losing twice, you're not gonna play</i>
<i>for that National Championship.</i>

06:17.251 --> 06:20.129
Well, I mean, we have to build up
our resume again, essentially.

06:20.213 --> 06:23.883
{\an8}<i>And beating people by double digits,</i>
<i>the way we do,</i>

06:23.966 --> 06:26.886
{\an8}<i>there's no way that they could</i>
<i>keep us out of the top two.</i>

06:26.969 --> 06:31.015
[Buddy] <i>You can look at the scoreboard,</i>
<i>and you can see a direct correlation</i>

06:31.099 --> 06:32.975
<i>to the teams playing</i>
<i>for National Championship.</i>

06:33.059 --> 06:36.854
I mean, it's not my fault that the...
that if we have a close game...

06:36.979 --> 06:39.357
It was a... it was a few years back,
we had a close game,

06:39.440 --> 06:43.903
we dropped four places in the, uh...
in the national rankings.

06:43.986 --> 06:47.365
"Hold on a second.
Does that mean I have to win by more?

06:47.448 --> 06:49.200
If... if so, I'll do that."

06:49.283 --> 06:52.120
And we're just a very hated bunch
around the state,

06:52.203 --> 06:53.913
and I can live with that.

06:53.996 --> 06:56.874
'Cause if we're hated,
it means we're doing something right.

07:26.237 --> 07:27.822
[indistinct chatter]

07:29.282 --> 07:30.992
-[laughing]
-Yes, we're gonna vote.

07:31.075 --> 07:32.660
[Hannah] <i>My name is</i>
<i>Hannah Lynn Daugherty.</i>

07:32.743 --> 07:34.412
<i>I'm running for Queen.</i>

07:34.495 --> 07:35.913
{\an8}-Homecoming Queen.
-Yeah, Homecoming Queen.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.540
{\an8}-This is one of my BFFs.
-[laughs]

07:37.623 --> 07:39.959
{\an8}She, um... she's gonna support me.
All the way.

07:40.042 --> 07:42.170
{\an8}-Vote Hannah Homecoming Queen!
-Whoo!

07:42.253 --> 07:44.046
-Let's go, Lions.
-[laughs]

07:45.089 --> 07:47.216
[Hannah] Hey, guys!
[Wyatt] What's up?

07:47.300 --> 07:48.676
-Nice game, by the way.
-[Wyatt] Appreciate it.

07:48.759 --> 07:51.179
{\an8}Thank you. That made me feel
a lot better about myself.

07:51.262 --> 07:54.765
{\an8}Um, my name is Hannah Lynn Daugherty,
I'm running for Homecoming Queen.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.350
And I was just wondering
if y'all would vote for me.

07:56.434 --> 07:57.643
-Yeah.
-[Hannah] Yay.

07:57.727 --> 07:58.936
[student] Sure.

07:59.979 --> 08:01.939
-Appreciate it.
-Thanks, guys.

08:02.023 --> 08:04.275
-No problem.
-Thank you.

08:04.358 --> 08:05.443
[Hannah] Thank y'all.

08:05.526 --> 08:07.612
-[camera clicks]
-[indistinct chatter]

08:10.114 --> 08:12.116
[Hannah] <i>Our reputation was,</i>

08:12.200 --> 08:14.118
<i>"We are number one.</i>
<i>Nobody beats us."</i>

08:14.202 --> 08:16.412
<i>And I think that's what got us this year.</i>

08:16.496 --> 08:19.874
<i>You gotta come in there...</i>
<i>the heart and desire to win.</i>

08:19.957 --> 08:22.502
<i>Not because, "Hey, we're East Mississippi,</i>
<i>we're gonna win."</i>

08:22.585 --> 08:23.920
But the next week, they did.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.464
They came back, they said,
"Hannah, we're gonna win it."

08:26.547 --> 08:27.757
And I was like, "You gonna win?

08:27.840 --> 08:29.926
Are you just sayin' that,
or are you actually want to win?"

08:30.009 --> 08:32.094
They wanted...
They wanted to win and it showed.

08:32.178 --> 08:35.222
And it was a whole different perspective
with them.

08:35.306 --> 08:38.558
I came out there, you know,
I was kinda scared, we lost.

08:38.643 --> 08:41.062
I didn't wanna show them
I was kind of scared.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.523
When we started playing,
I started seeing the drive a little bit.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.608
I was like,
"This is the team I wanted to see.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.068
This is the team I miss."

08:52.657 --> 08:54.283
[Marcel] Getting close to Homecoming,
I guess, huh?

08:54.367 --> 08:56.410
{\an8}Yep, yep, yep.

08:56.494 --> 08:59.288
{\an8}-And I really don't vote.
-[scoffs] Me neither.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.332
[Ryan] I'm gonna vote for Hannah, though.
[Wagner] Mmm...

09:01.415 --> 09:02.583
Why are you gonna vote for Hannah?

09:02.667 --> 09:03.709
[Marcel] I'm definitely voting for Hannah.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.461
-'Cause she is fine.
-[Wagner laughs]

09:05.545 --> 09:08.548
-[Marcel] She is one hottie.
-Fine. Mmm.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.758
-[Wagner] She is a very pretty girl.
-She, uh...

09:10.841 --> 09:12.760
And she will get my vote,
'cause she earned it.

09:12.843 --> 09:14.303
-[Wagner] She will not... She earned it?
-Yeah.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.429
-'Cause she's pretty?
-Mmm-hmm.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.932
[Wagner] What if she was mean?
What if she was pretty and mean?

09:18.015 --> 09:19.100
Still would've got it.

09:19.183 --> 09:21.018
-It's all about looks, basically.
-[Wagner] Yeah.

09:21.102 --> 09:24.564
So, if I don't vote for them,
that'd mean they're poo, like, garbage.

09:24.647 --> 09:25.940
-[Wagner chuckles] Whoa.
-Like, ugly.

09:26.023 --> 09:27.942
-[Wagner] No...
-Yeah.

09:28.025 --> 09:32.196
[Wagner] No, it just...
No, it just means that you...

09:32.280 --> 09:34.699
-Chose the prettier girl.
-[Wagner] But Homecoming court...

09:34.782 --> 09:37.827
it should be people that represent
the school well.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.079
So you don't have to be pretty
to represent the school well.

09:40.162 --> 09:41.872
[Ryan] If you looked like--

09:41.956 --> 09:43.624
[Marcel] Why I can't run?

09:44.875 --> 09:46.168
'Cause you look like Joy Behar.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.546
[all laughing]

09:50.673 --> 09:52.883
-That's why he can't run.
-[Marcel] That ain't right.

09:52.967 --> 09:55.928
[Wagner] How do you even know
who Joy Behar is?

09:56.012 --> 09:58.222
-I watched <i>Hangover.</i>
-[Wagner] You used to watch <i>The View?</i>

09:58.306 --> 10:00.266
-I just watched <i>Hangover,</i> he was like...
-[Wagner laughing]

10:00.349 --> 10:01.684
"Is that a male satch?"

10:01.767 --> 10:04.353
And he was like,
"Boy, you look like Joy Behar."

10:04.437 --> 10:06.981
-[Marcel laughs]
-'Cause he's gay, I'm guessing.

10:07.064 --> 10:09.442
[Marcel] He gay? [indistinct muttering]

10:09.525 --> 10:12.069
[Wagner] What are you talking about?
Nobody on <i>The Hangover</i> was gay.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.738
I'm talking about Joy Behar.

10:13.821 --> 10:15.489
[Wagner] Joy Behar is a woman.

10:16.490 --> 10:18.034
-[Wagner laughing]
-[Marcel] Really?

10:18.117 --> 10:20.119
[chuckles] I swear,
I didn't know that, bro.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.121
[Marcel] Really?
[Wagner] Let me show you.

10:22.204 --> 10:24.206
-It sounded like a man name!
-[Wagner laughing]

10:24.290 --> 10:25.708
-[Marcel muttering]
-Joy?

10:25.791 --> 10:29.629
-[Ryan] Joy Behar.
-Not "Joey." Joy.

10:29.712 --> 10:32.423
This is Joy Behar. That is not...

10:32.506 --> 10:35.009
I'm pretty sure that does not look like...

10:35.092 --> 10:36.719
[both laughing]

10:40.556 --> 10:41.557
[Marcel] She's hot.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.978
[coach] There it is.

10:47.229 --> 10:49.148
[indistinct chatter]

10:51.317 --> 10:52.777
[Buddy] <i>You got an opportunity</i>

10:52.860 --> 10:55.154
<i>to go out and play</i>
<i>in front of your families this weekend.</i>

10:55.237 --> 10:57.365
Prepare yourself.

10:58.574 --> 11:02.244
Prepare yourself to play against the team
that wants to whip your ass, okay?

11:02.328 --> 11:05.665
Prepare yourself mentally
and physically to go beat their ass.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.626
Talked to Dr. Huebner yesterday.

11:08.709 --> 11:11.462
Co-Lin played an ineligible player
the first two ball games,

11:11.545 --> 11:15.424
so you've got a new damn lease
on a lot of shit, okay?

11:15.508 --> 11:17.510
Defense, get your ass on that sideline.

11:17.593 --> 11:19.303
Offense, get your ass over there.
Go. Move. Now.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.472
-[indistinct chatter]
-[whistle blows]

11:22.390 --> 11:24.809
[Buddy] Let's go. On the hop.
On the hop. Let's go.

11:24.892 --> 11:26.185
<i>Hurry up!</i>

11:29.522 --> 11:32.983
One of my guys just told me that
Co-Lin had to forfeit all of their games.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.945
They played two ineligible players,
so we're undefeated again.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.822
-[Wagner] Shut up.
-You didn't hear about that?

11:37.905 --> 11:40.116
[player] Oh, yeah.
[Salter] Y'all overheard? Is that true?

11:40.199 --> 11:41.200
So what's that mean?

11:41.283 --> 11:44.453
Some dude didn't have a high school
diploma through the State of Mississippi,

11:44.537 --> 11:47.081
so they're supposed to either forfeit
their first two games

11:47.164 --> 11:49.792
and give us our streak back
and put us back at number one,

11:49.875 --> 11:53.295
or forfeit the rest of their season.

11:53.379 --> 11:57.091
-If we play 'em again...
-[Wagner] It's not on the NJCAA website.

11:57.174 --> 11:58.634
[Salter] If they have
to forfeit three games,

11:58.717 --> 12:00.094
you won't ever see 'em again.

12:00.177 --> 12:02.847
[Wagner] Yeah, they wouldn't make
the playoffs if they forfeit three games.

12:02.930 --> 12:04.223
[James] Oh, it'd be over with.
[Wagner] Wow.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.351
That's huge.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.937
The deal with Co-Lin, we'll worry
about that when that comes through.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.772
We're going to get that one back.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.108
That's what's probably fixin' to happen.

12:14.191 --> 12:15.317
And I had someone ask me the other day,

12:15.401 --> 12:16.735
"If that happens,
will that be tainted to you?"

12:16.819 --> 12:17.820
I said, "Not at all, man.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.489
If you cheat and you get caught,
you get busted, that's part of the deal."

12:20.573 --> 12:21.866
Okay?
So I'm not worried about any of that.

12:21.949 --> 12:24.702
What I'm interested in is, are you gonna
do the things you're supposed to do?

12:24.785 --> 12:26.120
Are you gonna work
the way you're supposed to work?

12:26.203 --> 12:27.913
Are you gonna do the things
that you're capable of doing?

12:27.997 --> 12:30.458
You are. No doubt about it.
All right, baby.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.922
[John] <i>Gus Malzahn, he told me to come</i>
<i>next week, so I'm gonna go...</i>

12:37.006 --> 12:39.842
[stammers] Go to that Iron Bowl game.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.760
-Alabama-Auburn.
-[Gary] Oh, yeah, yeah.

12:41.844 --> 12:44.013
[John] I hope it's at Auburn, too.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.723
Auburn's right down the street.

12:45.806 --> 12:48.476
Yeah, my sister and my godmama,
they're gonna come to the Homecoming game.

12:48.559 --> 12:50.811
All my family coming up
for the Homecoming game.

12:50.895 --> 12:53.564
Finna' to make that drive.
All of them.

12:54.482 --> 12:57.318
Grandma, sisters, godmama, auntie,
all of 'em.

12:58.652 --> 12:59.987
[Buddy] <i>Here's the deal, okay?</i>

13:00.070 --> 13:03.073
If you're not making plays,
we're gonna put somebody in there

13:03.157 --> 13:05.201
that's gonna make some plays, okay?

13:05.284 --> 13:09.038
So we're gonna put people in there
that's gonna make an impact in the game,

13:09.121 --> 13:11.874
and some of you guys
that are not making impacts in the game,

13:11.957 --> 13:13.751
gonna find yourself over there with us.

13:13.834 --> 13:17.338
We're gonna find people that are
gonna make impacts and go plays.

13:17.421 --> 13:19.673
'Cause I think Coach Wood said it best,

13:19.757 --> 13:23.052
"It's having dog in you.
It's having some dog in you."

13:23.135 --> 13:24.803
Some, "Go get after it."

13:27.389 --> 13:30.476
[Trickett] <i>Where we're at now,</i>
<i>with Wyatt being the starter,</i>

13:30.559 --> 13:32.603
<i>I don't think it's necessarily over</i>

13:32.686 --> 13:37.691
{\an8}as far as the competition,
but, you know, we are in week five now.

13:37.775 --> 13:41.320
{\an8}You know, we kinda wanna get a guy.

13:41.403 --> 13:44.031
<i>John, he's just gotta be more consistent,</i>

13:44.114 --> 13:46.325
<i>'cause sometimes he'll be erratic</i>
<i>with his throws.</i>

13:46.408 --> 13:49.537
<i>He's not extremely accurate,</i>
<i>um, like Wyatt is.</i>

13:49.620 --> 13:50.955
John can go deep over the top,

13:51.038 --> 13:53.082
but that's not really
what we do offensively.

13:53.165 --> 13:57.169
<i>We just nickel-and-dime it down the field,</i>
<i>which is exactly what Wyatt does.</i>

13:57.253 --> 13:59.338
-[player grunts]
-[John] Oh, shit. Oh!

13:59.421 --> 14:00.839
[whistle blowing]

14:02.258 --> 14:05.469
[John sighs] <i>Uh, definitely frustrating.</i>
<i>Definitely.</i>

14:05.553 --> 14:07.596
You do what's best for the team,

14:07.680 --> 14:10.975
but at the same time, you know,
it's very frustrating.

14:11.058 --> 14:14.061
You just try to not show it,
but sometimes it's hard not to show it.

14:14.144 --> 14:16.897
<i>A lot of people thought</i>
<i>I should have stayed at Florida State.</i>

14:18.023 --> 14:21.569
[sighs] <i>Uh, some of my family, you know,</i>
<i>we got into it a couple of times.</i>

14:21.652 --> 14:25.155
Thought I should've just stayed
and waited it out, but...

14:25.239 --> 14:28.659
I mean, at the end of the day,
it was my decision.

14:28.742 --> 14:31.328
So, you know, if everything doesn't work
out for me, I can live with that.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.831
You know what I'm saying?
It's my decision, my life, my career.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.752
[James] These wack-ass
Kemper County boys, man.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.963
I'm so ready to get the hell out of here.

14:41.046 --> 14:43.632
You tell 'em.
It can't be December fast enough.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.886
Man, I'm gone
and I ain't coming back either.

14:46.969 --> 14:49.555
People gonna be like,
"John, where you been for six months?"

14:49.638 --> 14:51.056
"I don't know.
I fell off the Earth."

14:51.140 --> 14:54.101
I disappeared for a little bit,
but now I'm back.

14:54.184 --> 14:56.812
I was working with the Feds.
They had me in Witness Protection.

14:56.937 --> 14:59.106
-I was locked up.
-[laughing]

14:59.189 --> 15:01.233
-They wouldn't let me out.
-[both laughing]

15:02.359 --> 15:04.278
We really is locked up though.

15:07.406 --> 15:10.242
[teacher] So to find the X intercept,

15:10.326 --> 15:13.203
set zero...

15:14.580 --> 15:17.917
for your Y.

15:19.460 --> 15:23.088
{\an8}Once you definitely learn
how to find the YX intercept...

15:23.172 --> 15:26.926
{\an8}I think the Y... Finding the YX intercept
is also easy for the computer too,

15:27.009 --> 15:29.637
'cause you know you only need two points.

15:31.597 --> 15:36.852
[Wagner] DJ has three absences in College
Study Skills and four absences in Math,

15:36.936 --> 15:40.564
that's gonna make him ineligible
if he gets dropped from both of those.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.983
I mean, we're not even
to the midterm point,

15:43.067 --> 15:45.319
and he's already got four absences.

15:46.111 --> 15:48.447
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>he gets dropped in two more...</i>

15:48.530 --> 15:51.033
All right.
She got a couple minutes.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.994
[Wagner] <i>The chances of that happening</i>
<i>before the National Championship are...</i>

15:54.078 --> 15:56.205
<i>I mean, that's almost 100% gonna happen.</i>

15:56.288 --> 15:57.581
If he gets dropped from both of them,

15:57.665 --> 16:01.168
he's gonna totally screw
his graduation up, though, so...

16:02.252 --> 16:06.423
he'll have bigger problems
than playing in a game.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.386
[DJ] I told you she got a couple minutes.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.221
'Cause I will dip on her ass.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.847
[chuckles]

16:13.931 --> 16:16.600
See, if the camera wasn't here
I would've been dipped on y'all.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.143
[laughing]

16:18.227 --> 16:22.106
I'll try to be a good influence,
you feel me?

16:22.189 --> 16:24.233
But, boy... [laughing]

16:25.651 --> 16:27.861
[interviewer] You do whatever you want,
DJ, we don't care.

16:27.945 --> 16:28.946
I'm gone.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.449
Let's go.

16:32.533 --> 16:35.828
Hey, it's 11:05 and she ain't here.

16:35.911 --> 16:36.912
[student] I bet.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.164
[DJ laughing] All right.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.086
After I dip, the whole class dips.
See, that's why I try to wait.

16:44.837 --> 16:48.424
[laughing] That's why I try to wait.
Trying to be a good influence.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.092
Everybody is out.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.391
[Buddy] <i>All stories</i>
<i>aren't success stories.</i>

16:57.474 --> 17:00.477
<i>It's just hard sometimes,</i>
<i>because you see great kids</i>

17:00.561 --> 17:05.190
that just won't... commit.

17:05.273 --> 17:08.694
<i>Now, they'll commit to being at practice,</i>
<i>they won't be late for a meeting,</i>

17:08.777 --> 17:10.863
<i>but when it comes to class? Please.</i>

17:11.905 --> 17:14.199
<i>So, we'll do the best we can when it...</i>

17:14.282 --> 17:16.577
<i>You know, for... for stuff like that.</i>

17:16.660 --> 17:20.748
And I say we'll do the best we can.
Are we really doing the best we can?

17:20.830 --> 17:22.833
Are we really doing the best we can?

17:25.294 --> 17:28.380
<i>Or are we just saying that</i>
<i>because if we were doing the best we can,</i>

17:28.464 --> 17:30.257
<i>wouldn't we punish them</i>
<i>if they didn't go to class,</i>

17:30.340 --> 17:31.884
<i>not letting them practice?</i>

17:31.967 --> 17:34.094
<i>And therefore maybe not letting them play?</i>

17:34.178 --> 17:36.096
<i>I mean, every...</i>

17:36.180 --> 17:41.351
<i>every coach, every team in America has</i>
<i>the same thing they have to go through.</i>

17:41.435 --> 17:42.603
<i>Where's my line?</i>

17:42.686 --> 17:46.565
When have I put winning
or being successful on the field

17:46.648 --> 17:51.904
ahead of truly putting the success
of the student athlete there, you know?

17:51.987 --> 17:53.030
We all do that.

18:02.956 --> 18:04.875
[Wyatt] What's up?
[Wagner] What's up?

18:04.958 --> 18:06.376
Nothing. Bored.

18:07.377 --> 18:08.879
-[Wagner] Bored?
-Yep.

18:08.962 --> 18:10.547
My class got canceled.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.382
Well, hell, you ain't been in a week.

18:12.466 --> 18:15.260
I know. Then, I get back,
and they cancel it.

18:15.344 --> 18:16.345
I'm so behind.

18:16.428 --> 18:19.932
I know, you literally haven't
been to class in a week.

18:20.015 --> 18:23.018
But I can't help it.
Hey, can I drop a class?

18:23.102 --> 18:26.230
No. Heck, no.
Have you lost your ever-loving mind?

18:26.313 --> 18:28.565
Y'all have to have
every single thing you're in.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.651
I said that, at the team meeting,
at the beginning of the year.

18:30.734 --> 18:32.778
I thought I was ahead of the schedule,
'cause I took the class--

18:32.861 --> 18:33.904
That's the thing I'm talking about.

18:33.987 --> 18:35.155
I stand up in front of y'all and talk,

18:35.239 --> 18:36.949
and every one of y'all think,
"She ain't talking to me."

18:37.032 --> 18:39.076
I'm talking to you.
All of you.

18:39.159 --> 18:41.328
-[Wyatt] Guess I wasn't listening.
-Thanks.

18:41.411 --> 18:42.913
You wanna graduate?

18:42.996 --> 18:46.166
Oh, I'm graduating, with or without
a diploma, don't worry about that.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.794
I ain't staying here another day
past December.

18:48.877 --> 18:50.587
I got the countdown thing on my phone.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.799
-What countdown thing?
-An app.

18:53.882 --> 18:55.509
-[Wagner] Shut up.
-Okay.

18:55.592 --> 18:58.637
You have an app on your phone that
counts down your days left in Scooba?

18:58.720 --> 19:00.305
-Yeah, you wanna see it?
-[player] Oh, yeah.

19:00.389 --> 19:04.476
Fifty-seven days, two hours,
46 minutes and 20 seconds.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.563
-That makes me sad!
-It makes me happy.

19:08.897 --> 19:12.401
Y'all! That's not very nice.

19:12.484 --> 19:13.986
[stutters] "Ain't very nice"?

19:14.069 --> 19:15.529
Uh-uh.

19:15.612 --> 19:19.074
-You think I... You think I just--
-[player] How many days you got left?

19:19.158 --> 19:21.326
See? He got it too.
Look, look.

19:21.410 --> 19:22.619
[both chuckling]

19:22.703 --> 19:25.747
I got 57, you got 58. Damn.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.416
I count that extra day.

19:27.499 --> 19:29.626
I got mine to right after
the National Championship.

19:29.710 --> 19:30.711
Oh.

19:31.795 --> 19:34.506
[Wagner] You have to go to class
after the National Championship.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.341
Yeah, but I'm not...
I'm not living here anymore.

19:36.425 --> 19:37.426
I'm commuting.

19:37.509 --> 19:39.261
[Wagner] You know what
the sad thing is about?

19:39.344 --> 19:41.096
I don't have anything
to even count down to.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.933
I don't have anything exciting
to look forward to.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.560
[player] The next yogurt?

19:47.728 --> 19:50.063
[Wagner] <i>Four, three, two...</i>

19:50.147 --> 19:53.108
-[music playing over stereo]
-Hold it up and crunch. Here we go, fast.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.361
Eight, hang with me.
Seven, six, come on!

19:56.445 --> 20:00.741
-Five, four, three, two, one...
-[music playing on stereo]

20:24.389 --> 20:27.059
But whoever gets it,
that's awesome,

20:27.142 --> 20:28.602
{\an8}to be known as...

20:29.478 --> 20:32.147
{\an8}EMCC's Homecoming Queen.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.690
{\an8}[Brittany] <i>I'm running</i>

You can't just...
want, want, want, want, want.

21:29.871 --> 21:33.834
You gotta take what you have
in front of you and just go with it.

21:33.917 --> 21:35.168
Because God has a plan for you,

21:35.252 --> 21:37.587
regardless if you're
Homecoming Queen or not.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.731
Same thing except black, I guess.

21:56.648 --> 21:57.733
[Isaiah] How?

21:58.692 --> 22:01.194
I don't know how to answer that question.
I've never been black before.

-Never?
-No, not like that.

22:08.952 --> 22:10.495
But I haven't, no.

22:10.579 --> 22:11.747
[player chuckles]

22:11.830 --> 22:13.332
It'll change your life,

[Wagner] Hey, Ollie.

22:29.681 --> 22:30.849
What ya doing?

22:31.767 --> 22:33.226
[Ollie clicks tongue] Chilling.

22:33.310 --> 22:34.728
[Wagner] How was your test?

22:35.687 --> 22:36.938
[Ollie] It was a'ight.

22:37.022 --> 22:40.317
[Wagner] You didn't come in here to get
a refresher before you went in there.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.110
Because I was a'ight.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.738
-How was the doctor yesterday?
-[chuckles] Great.

22:44.821 --> 22:46.907
-What did he say?
-I can play.

22:46.990 --> 22:49.159
[gasps] You can?

22:49.242 --> 22:51.119
-This week?
-Yes. Yes.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.218
[Williams] Hey,
you never flipped your hips!

23:07.219 --> 23:09.179
Hey, come here.
Come here.

23:09.262 --> 23:11.056
You trying to come
to the inside of the guy...

23:11.139 --> 23:13.517
You can't turn the corner,
right here, with your hips square.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.685
You gotta flip your hips
and turn your hips to the quarterback.

23:15.811 --> 23:16.770
[Ollie] All right.

23:16.853 --> 23:19.856
[Williams] <i>Ollie will go as far</i>
<i>as Ollie let himself go.</i>

23:19.940 --> 23:24.820
{\an8}And, you know, he's fighting to get
a scholarship to any SEC school.

23:24.903 --> 23:26.029
{\an8}That's where he wants to be,

23:26.113 --> 23:28.949
{\an8}so I keep hammering with that
every week, every day.

23:29.032 --> 23:31.868
"You wanna play in the SEC?
Okay, well, you can't do that."

23:31.952 --> 23:34.246
[Buddy] Hit! That's good.
Good. Good.

23:34.329 --> 23:35.914
[Williams] Come on, lift it!
Lift it! Lift it!

23:35.997 --> 23:38.291
[Lesley] <i>It's been a tough</i>
<i>couple games without him.</i>

23:38.375 --> 23:40.794
<i>He's just a spark that we need,</i>

23:40.877 --> 23:43.421
and when you lose
a player like that, it hurts.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.757
But now we've got him back, and...

23:45.841 --> 23:47.759
you know, you need that.

23:48.510 --> 23:51.388
[Lesley] This is a big one.
This is a big one.

23:51.471 --> 23:52.639
I'm sure we'll have some kinda new,

23:52.722 --> 23:55.725
pretty, latest greatest shit
for Homecoming and all that.

23:55.809 --> 23:59.980
And you'll have a lot of people...
that the reason you got all that shit...

24:00.063 --> 24:01.857
Look, everybody get your eyes up,
listen to me.

24:01.940 --> 24:06.069
The reason you got all that shit,
those people...

24:06.153 --> 24:09.114
will be sitting on that sideline,
watching you play Saturday.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.533
<i>And I don't know, man.</i>

24:11.616 --> 24:15.120
[stammers] <i>Right now, to some of us,</i>
<i>that may not mean a whole lot to you.</i>

24:15.203 --> 24:18.790
<i>When you look at all the shit you got,</i>
<i>and how people take care of you,</i>

24:18.874 --> 24:22.419
<i>you better have learned</i>
<i>to have a sense of pride about that.</i>

24:22.502 --> 24:26.131
<i>An appreciation of people that</i>
<i>give a shit about this football program</i>

24:26.214 --> 24:28.049

24:59.080 --> 25:00.624
Everybody was laughing.

25:01.625 --> 25:05.503
And sooner or later,
I heard other people growling...

25:06.922 --> 25:08.590

{\an8}"What's your favorite

{\an8}I say, "Well...
[chuckles] it's Scooba Tech."

25:30.278 --> 25:32.030
<i>I take a lot of pride in this school.</i>

25:32.113 --> 25:35.450

we put our money into, football.

Don't show a damn bit of weakness.

from the time we kick that ball off,
till the time we shake their hand.

you give them 60 minutes of hell.

Have a good series here.

{\an8}[Kealer Franklin] <i>We have always</i>

28:37.799 --> 28:39.634
{\an8}He gets really hard on himself

28:39.718 --> 28:43.054
{\an8}because he sets a high expectation
for what he does.

28:43.138 --> 28:44.764
{\an8}And when it doesn't go that way,

28:44.848 --> 28:47.183
{\an8}he can sometimes get down on himself.

28:47.267 --> 28:48.685
So I have to be that voice that says,

28:48.768 --> 28:50.478
<i>"Look, boy."</i> [laughs]

37:16.442 --> 37:19.028
'cause you're not a football coach
or a player.

37:19.111 --> 37:22.114
If we're getting cheap shotted,
I say cheap shot back.

37:22.823 --> 37:23.824
{\an8}I mean--

37:23.908 --> 37:25.326
{\an8}[Wagner] But who's gonna get
thrown out of the game?

37:25.409 --> 37:27.161
{\an8}We are, because we're the better team.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.247
-I mean--
-Everyone's always for the underdog.

37:29.330 --> 37:30.873
-Yeah, you're right. You're right.
-Even the referees.

37:30.957 --> 37:32.875
So, if you do, if you...

37:32.959 --> 37:34.794
If they cheap shot
and you cheap shot back,

37:34.877 --> 37:36.462
your ass is the one
that's gonna get thrown out,

37:36.545 --> 37:38.965
not the other guy
that's getting his brains beat.

37:39.048 --> 37:41.926
Yeah, but we ain't gonna sit there
and get hurt, either.

37:42.009 --> 37:43.427
[John] Well, we play a violent game.

37:43.511 --> 37:45.513
We do, and I understand
sometimes it gets--

37:45.596 --> 37:47.515
We risk life and death every time
the ball gets snapped.

37:47.598 --> 37:50.017
-Oh, please. You're not at war.
-So, when you have that mindset...

37:50.101 --> 37:51.102
-It's football.
-How are we not?

37:51.185 --> 37:53.437
[Wagner] To me, all the talk
and all the fighting

37:53.521 --> 37:56.440
cheapens the fact
that we're whooping your ass.

37:56.524 --> 37:57.733
Like, just whoop their ass.

37:57.817 --> 37:59.443
And, like, why do you need to...

38:00.444 --> 38:02.655
If you're that good,
why do you even need to run your mouth?

38:02.738 --> 38:04.031
You know, I mean, it's like,

38:04.115 --> 38:06.450
"Buddy, we're up 31-3
in the third quarter,

38:06.534 --> 38:08.369
why do you even need to argue
whatever you're arguing?

38:08.452 --> 38:10.955
Like, just win."

38:11.956 --> 38:13.207
[Wagner] Hey, Ollie.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.459
[Jay] Ollie.
[player] Ollie.

38:15.543 --> 38:16.544
What'd I do?

38:16.627 --> 38:18.170
[Jay] When do you talk shit
to the other team?

38:18.254 --> 38:19.922
Tell them they ain't shit,
they ain't never gonna be shit,

38:20.006 --> 38:21.007
and their kids ain't gonna be shit.

38:21.090 --> 38:22.091
[all laughing]

38:22.174 --> 38:23.175
[Jay] See?

38:29.223 --> 38:32.601
{\an8}[Buddy] <i>Courtney... Courtney,</i>
<i>you're the only person,</i>

38:32.685 --> 38:35.229
{\an8}<i>out of everybody</i>
<i>that's seen all the video,</i>

38:35.313 --> 38:37.148
{\an8}<i>out of all the people</i>
<i>that were at the game,</i>

38:37.231 --> 38:40.067
{\an8}<i>you're the only person to say</i>
<i>that I swung at the guy.</i>

38:40.151 --> 38:41.986
{\an8}But Courtney sensationalized it.

38:42.069 --> 38:44.697
{\an8}Courtney sensationalized it,
and I understand.

38:44.780 --> 38:46.115
{\an8}[stutters] It's...

38:48.534 --> 38:50.911
Why don't you call Jim and ask him
about Co-Lin having to forfeit

38:50.995 --> 38:52.413
their first two ball games?

38:52.496 --> 38:54.999
Why don't you sensationalize
the shit out of that?

38:55.082 --> 38:57.168
Okay? Oh, no, no.
Hey...

38:57.251 --> 38:58.711
Look, go find out.

38:58.794 --> 39:01.505
All right? I mean, if you wanna do
some investigative reporting,

39:01.589 --> 39:02.590
go figure that one out.

39:02.673 --> 39:06.719
And go figure out how... go figure out how
justice is rendered in this league.

39:07.595 --> 39:09.180
-All right, listen.
-[blows whistle]

39:09.263 --> 39:10.306
Listen.

39:10.389 --> 39:13.100
Taylor, you and Willis,
you got a one-game suspension.

39:13.184 --> 39:14.393
[Javarius] Sorry.
[Buddy] Okay?

39:14.477 --> 39:16.979
Somebody should have got in between
y'all before it happened.

39:17.104 --> 39:19.899
Needless to say,
we all have our penance to pay.

39:19.982 --> 39:21.942
They've suspended me two games.

39:22.026 --> 39:25.112
[stammers] Okay?
Hey, we're not worried about it.

39:25.196 --> 39:27.406
-'Cause nobody stops this train, right?
-[players agreeing]

39:27.490 --> 39:30.242
That's what we've been saying all along,
people are trying to derail us...

39:30.326 --> 39:31.660
People are gonna hate you.

39:31.744 --> 39:34.663
People are gonna hate for no reason.
You know what I'm talking about.

39:34.747 --> 39:38.084
People are gonna hate for no reason
just 'cause you are who you are.

39:38.167 --> 39:40.836
And that's not only here,
but it's in society.

39:40.920 --> 39:41.921
Period.
All right?

39:42.004 --> 39:45.174
And I gotta handle it in a certain way.
You gotta handle it in a certain way.

39:45.257 --> 39:46.300
And the way we're gonna do it

39:46.384 --> 39:48.386
is we're gonna keep working,
we're gonna bear down harder,

39:48.469 --> 39:50.721
and we're gonna put damn 70
on everybody we play.

39:50.805 --> 39:52.932
You understand?
Ain't no... ain't no letting up.

39:53.015 --> 39:54.183
Nobody stops the train.

39:54.266 --> 39:55.726
[players] Yes, sir.
[coach] What does that entail?

39:55.810 --> 39:58.020
You can be here... Can you still ride
the bus with us on game day?

39:58.104 --> 39:59.146
-[Buddy] No, nothing.
-Nothing.

39:59.230 --> 40:02.191
-You can be in the stands, can't you?
-[Buddy] Nope. Nothing.

40:02.274 --> 40:03.734
-[coach] Really?
-Can't be nothing.

40:03.818 --> 40:05.027
-[Trickett] Can you suspend them?
-Mmm.

40:05.111 --> 40:06.195
-[Trickett] I'm just kidding.
-[all laughing]

40:06.278 --> 40:07.613
[Wood] No, you weren't!
[Trickett] Kinda.

40:07.696 --> 40:08.948
[all laughing]

40:16.539 --> 40:19.125
-[Williams] Go! Go! Slick hands.
-[players grunting]

40:19.208 --> 40:20.876
[Williams] Go! Go!

40:20.960 --> 40:22.753
-[clanks]
-Good.

40:35.683 --> 40:37.059
[indistinct chatter]

40:37.560 --> 40:40.354
[Wood] Over. Work back.

40:40.479 --> 40:42.648
{\an8}Sit. You're all right.
Hop up.

40:42.731 --> 40:44.316
{\an8}-[DJ] I hate doing this shit.
-Let's go. Up, up.

40:44.400 --> 40:45.651
{\an8}That's fine.
That's fine.

40:45.734 --> 40:47.778
{\an8}Hop up. Hop up.
Walk around.

40:47.862 --> 40:50.489
Hey, get a drink, get a drink.
You're all right.

40:53.451 --> 40:54.452
[sighs]

40:55.661 --> 40:58.164
-That boy went and got super excited.
-Went and got a robo-leg.

40:58.247 --> 41:01.375
-[snickers] Go-go-gadget knee!
-[all chuckling]

41:02.543 --> 41:04.670
You gotta cut it,
you can't think about it.

41:04.753 --> 41:05.921
You gotta go.

41:06.005 --> 41:09.175
-That shit harder than it sound, though.
-No, my shit...

41:09.258 --> 41:12.511
I remember my brother tore his ACL,
he was scared to cut

41:12.595 --> 41:13.929
when he came back.

41:14.013 --> 41:15.014
Scared.

41:15.097 --> 41:17.683
He out here,
he might as well do somethin'. Oh, hell...

41:17.766 --> 41:20.019
[chuckles] Fuck that, he still got
somewhere to go after this.

41:20.102 --> 41:22.813
[Williams] There you go! Good!

41:22.897 --> 41:24.273
-[blows whistle]
-[Wood] There we go. Right!

41:24.356 --> 41:27.026
-Slow as a motherfucker.
-They make you wear it, too?

41:27.109 --> 41:30.404
They ain't making me wear it, but...
I'm wearing it.

41:30.488 --> 41:32.323
I don't wanna take that bitch off.

41:32.406 --> 41:33.449
You... you do?

41:33.532 --> 41:34.575
I don't.

41:34.658 --> 41:37.828
To keep my knee, like,
straight or some shit.

41:37.912 --> 41:42.082
Bro, I can't sit another week, bro.
I'm not trying to sit another week.

41:42.166 --> 41:46.253
They tell me I'm sittin' another week,
I'm going home, soon as they tell me that.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.005
-[both chuckle]
-You're going to the city?

41:48.088 --> 41:50.257
Fuck school and everything.

41:50.341 --> 41:53.636
[Wood] <i>He'd been a little bit down</i>
<i>with his knee and everything, he's blue.</i>

41:53.719 --> 41:55.971
He ended up
with a tear in his PCL,

41:56.055 --> 41:58.682
{\an8}which is something they're not gonna
operate on or anything like that.

41:58.766 --> 42:00.809
{\an8}But it'll sideline him
for at least a week.

42:00.935 --> 42:03.479
{\an8}To be honest, between me and you,
it's probably going to be two,

42:03.562 --> 42:04.730
'cause I'm not gonna rush him back.

42:04.813 --> 42:07.566
I'm gonna make sure his leg's
taken care of before we get him back out.

42:07.650 --> 42:10.069
Keep... keep loving him up.
We got him from this end.

42:10.152 --> 42:11.987
But just make sure you encourage him
from the house.

42:12.071 --> 42:15.199
You know how that goes. He just...
I just don't want him getting blue on me.

42:16.325 --> 42:17.826
[Wagner] <i>DJ Law.</i>

42:17.910 --> 42:19.578
<i>English...</i>

42:21.830 --> 42:25.709
[sighs] Fifty-five.
He went down a bunch of points.

42:32.466 --> 42:33.676
Good Lord.

42:34.969 --> 42:37.137
Is anybody passing English?

42:39.014 --> 42:41.183
-Did you already take the test?
-Yes.

42:41.267 --> 42:42.851
[Wagner] Are you in class?

42:46.272 --> 42:47.940
Did you just get there?

42:48.857 --> 42:51.735
Okay. You're aware that you...

42:51.819 --> 42:53.737
you cannot miss Math again.

42:53.821 --> 42:55.239
Or College Studies.

42:57.241 --> 42:58.951
I'm aware.

42:59.034 --> 43:00.327
{\an8}[Wagner] What'd they say about his knee?

43:00.411 --> 43:01.954
{\an8}He's definitely out for two weeks.

43:02.037 --> 43:03.205
{\an8}He's out for two?

43:03.289 --> 43:05.416
{\an8}That's pretty good for a knee injury.

43:05.499 --> 43:09.795
Could have been the whole season, right?

43:10.337 --> 43:11.714
I mean, I'll take two weeks.

43:11.797 --> 43:14.258
I thought he was gonna be out for good.

43:14.341 --> 43:15.593
[computer chimes]

43:15.676 --> 43:17.761
Oh, he just lied to my face.

43:17.845 --> 43:19.513
I just got a message from his teacher.

43:19.597 --> 43:21.265
DJ showed up 30 minutes late to class.

43:21.348 --> 43:23.434
Well, it's 10:00.
The class started at 9:30.

43:23.517 --> 43:25.227
I just said, "Did you just get there?"
He said, "No."

43:25.311 --> 43:27.563
-[typing]
-[computer chimes]

43:29.023 --> 43:30.899
That's gonna be an absence.

43:31.984 --> 43:33.485
-Did he go back in?
-[Derrick Conner] Mmm-mmm.

43:33.569 --> 43:35.112
He just came in here
to get a freaking pencil,

43:35.195 --> 43:36.196
and he didn't go back in there?

43:36.280 --> 43:37.865
He's outside on his phone.

43:45.539 --> 43:46.582
Was that DJ?

43:46.665 --> 43:47.666
[student] Yes, ma'am.

43:47.750 --> 43:48.876
[student 2] Yeah.

43:52.838 --> 43:54.923
[student 3] DJ right there.

43:58.052 --> 44:00.304
Where... where are you?

44:04.391 --> 44:06.518
Where are you?
You're not in class.

44:06.602 --> 44:09.271
And you came in and got a pencil
and then you left.

44:09.355 --> 44:11.315
And you were 30 minutes late.

44:17.446 --> 44:18.697
Okay.

44:18.781 --> 44:20.699
-[chuckles] Who you talkin'--
-He just hung up on me.

44:20.783 --> 44:21.784
Who that is?

44:22.910 --> 44:24.578
Oh, you about to call Coach.

44:25.996 --> 44:28.290
-Don't hang up on me. Ever.
-[chuckles]

44:30.542 --> 44:31.543
[scoffs]

44:32.544 --> 44:34.713

<i>Leaving 'cause he's hurt</i>
<i>and he's gonna miss two games</i>

44:42.346 --> 44:44.556
and he can't take this shit anymore.

44:46.183 --> 44:48.811
What is that about?
Explain that to me, please, Gary.

44:48.894 --> 44:52.231
Help me to understand the mentality of,
just, like,

44:52.314 --> 44:56.902
when something isn't going your way,
you just make it worse and quit.

44:58.237 --> 45:01.573
You've done it. Ollie's done it.
DJ's done it.

45:01.657 --> 45:04.326
I've had players, you know,
every year since I've been here...

45:04.410 --> 45:07.246
That's their mentality. Like,
when something isn't going their way,

45:07.329 --> 45:12.584
then it's, "Fuck this, and I'm quitting
this shit and packing up."

45:12.668 --> 45:14.628
And going back to what?

45:18.173 --> 45:20.092
Where does that come from?

45:20.175 --> 45:21.718
What is that about?

45:23.220 --> 45:24.847
You get tired of it sometimes.

45:24.930 --> 45:28.267
But like...
Okay, but what is the alternative?

45:28.350 --> 45:31.812
What are you gonna do that's
better than what you're trying to do?

45:31.937 --> 45:33.772
-Mmm-hmm.
-What's Plan B?

45:33.856 --> 45:36.024
You get tired of it.

45:38.819 --> 45:40.112
[DJ's friend]
You going to the city, bro?

45:40.195 --> 45:41.405
[DJ] That's what up.

45:41.488 --> 45:43.490
[music playing on car stereo]

45:54.084 --> 45:58.213
[preacher] All of us are gonna
go through some adversity. Amen.

45:58.297 --> 46:01.049
All of us are gonna have...
a valley.

46:01.133 --> 46:02.301
[congregation] Oh, yes.

46:02.384 --> 46:05.554
We're not always
gonna be on the mountain top...

46:05.637 --> 46:08.098
-[congregation] Yes.
-...but sometimes it's necessary

46:08.182 --> 46:09.683
for us to go through the valley.

46:09.766 --> 46:12.060
-I can't hide from it.
-[man] Yes, sir.

46:12.144 --> 46:13.896
I can't run from it.

46:13.979 --> 46:16.356
-I can't try to dodge it.
-All right.

46:16.440 --> 46:18.233
My question to you today is,

46:18.317 --> 46:22.738
"How will you handle
your valley experience?"

46:22.821 --> 46:24.198
[Wallace] Yes, he will.

46:24.281 --> 46:25.532
Yes, he is.

46:25.616 --> 46:26.992
Yes, he is.

this game 'cause DJ is hurt.

47:10.369 --> 47:12.746
So it's all on me.

47:18.168 --> 47:19.836
[announcer] <i>Roberts takes a snap,</i>
<i>leaves it with Wright,</i>

47:19.920 --> 47:23.340
<i>goes up the middle, gets to the goal line,</i>
<i>dives, touchdown, EMCC!</i>

47:23.423 --> 47:24.967
[Wood] Good job! Good job!

47:26.134 --> 47:27.344
[announcer]
<i>Here's the snap to Roberts,</i>

47:27.427 --> 47:28.470
<i>gonna leave it on the ground with Wright.</i>

47:28.554 --> 47:30.389
<i>Wright, trying to bounce it</i>
<i>to the outside near side,</i>

47:30.472 --> 47:31.807
<i>gets inside the five,</i>
<i>dives for the pylon...</i>

47:31.890 --> 47:33.308
<i>Touchdown, EMCC!</i>

47:33.392 --> 47:36.019
<i>Isaiah Wright showing</i>
<i>some athletic ability,</i>

47:36.103 --> 47:38.689
<i>and that's his third touchdown</i>
<i>of this game.</i>

47:39.898 --> 47:42.067
<i>And how about Marcus Wood?</i>

47:42.150 --> 47:45.821
<i>It's 28-nothing, EMCC,</i>
<i>with 7:05 to go in Ellisville.</i>

47:45.904 --> 47:49.866
<i>Back to Bobcat Stadium in a moment,</i>
<i>this is the EMCC Football Network.</i>

47:54.788 --> 47:56.790
[Cleveland] <i>Back then,</i>
<i>from what I've been told,</i>

47:56.873 --> 47:59.626
<i>you wouldn't see anything like</i>
<i>you see today.</i>

48:00.377 --> 48:04.131
<i>I mean, there was one time</i>
<i>that they made him sit in a chair,</i>

48:04.214 --> 48:06.341
<i>Bull Sullivan, because he had</i>
<i>gone out on the field</i>

48:06.425 --> 48:08.719
<i>and kicked a football</i>
<i>the week before.</i>

48:08.802 --> 48:11.263
They made him sit in a chair
the whole game,

48:11.346 --> 48:14.016
that was the penalty,
he had to sit still in a chair.

48:14.099 --> 48:16.226
Just gotta win this one, boys.
Win this one.

48:17.144 --> 48:21.106
[Vic] <i>He had assembled a team that was</i>
<i>better than the one he had in '64.</i>

48:21.189 --> 48:23.358
<i>He never bragged,</i>
<i>but he told my mama, said, uh,</i>

48:23.442 --> 48:26.361
<i>"This year's gonna be like a card game</i>

48:26.445 --> 48:28.614
<i>and I'm gonna have a royal flush."</i>

48:28.697 --> 48:33.910
And then he got fired the summer
before that fall started.

48:33.994 --> 48:35.370
-Shit!
-[phone chimes]

48:36.204 --> 48:39.458
[Studdard] <i>The present school</i>
<i>assembled board members</i>

48:39.541 --> 48:41.918
and took a vote to oust him...

48:42.002 --> 48:45.047
I think they were afraid that Coach would
throw one of those fits,

48:45.130 --> 48:48.508
and, uh, embarrass
their college or something.

48:48.592 --> 48:50.636
<i>They were afraid of what he might do.</i>

48:53.013 --> 48:55.599
Dang! Facemask.

48:55.682 --> 48:59.144
You know, he'd done dedicated nearly
all of his adult life to the school.

48:59.227 --> 49:01.104
And it killed him.

49:01.188 --> 49:04.024
{\an8}[Cleveland] <i>He literally died</i>
<i>from heartbreak.</i>

49:04.107 --> 49:08.236
<i>Didn't know how to act,</i>
<i>or how to live without having football.</i>

49:08.320 --> 49:11.698
[shouting] What are you talking about?
Why'd you throw that?

49:11.782 --> 49:13.200
Why'd you throw that?

49:13.283 --> 49:14.993
Golly. Bum.

49:16.578 --> 49:19.748
[alumnus] <i>A tough, hard-nose redneck</i>
<i>from the swamp, like I am.</i>

49:20.457 --> 49:22.501
You know, just speaking of him...

49:22.584 --> 49:25.462
will make tears come in your eyes.

49:25.545 --> 49:27.089
[voice breaking]
You know, we loved him.

49:27.172 --> 49:30.342
You know he was a good coach.
And you know he was a good man.

49:30.425 --> 49:32.427
[Studdard] <i>He loved this place.</i>

49:32.511 --> 49:34.137
<i>This is a place that, uh...</i>

49:34.221 --> 49:35.472
[wincing]

49:35.555 --> 49:38.558
We honor the past.

49:38.642 --> 49:43.355
But we're proud of where we are now,
and we look forward to the future,

49:43.438 --> 49:45.190
<i>because we know that there...</i>

49:45.273 --> 49:46.692
<i>there are good days ahead.</i>
