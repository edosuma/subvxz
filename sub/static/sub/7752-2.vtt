That's really sweet.

Look, i think i got so upset
because...

29:07.980 --> 29:11.949
It feels like you're starting
a new family without me.

29:11.951 --> 29:14.752
And it really hurt.

29:14.754 --> 29:17.454
I can understand that.

You're starting
a new life with remi.

you were my friend.

Then why is it such a big deal
to find me a job?

Because
you're a bad maid!

30:26.258 --> 30:28.525
You're not even
gonna deny it?

30:28.527 --> 30:30.093
Why would i deny it?

It's not like you think
i'm a bad singer.

This is the problem.
You don't care.

It is literally my business.

Businesses are built
on reputations.

Until then,

for something in return.
