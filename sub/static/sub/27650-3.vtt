WEBVTT

00:02.960 --> 00:04.960
If that information is reliable,

00:04.960 --> 00:06.960
they're gonna blow
the competition away.

00:06.960 --> 00:08.960
You wanna be
a cleaner for the rest of your life?

00:08.960 --> 00:10.960
You can't waste this opportunity.

00:10.960 --> 00:13.960
The chances of us getting caught
are like a billion to one.

00:13.960 --> 00:15.960
You're suspended.
Pending an investigation.

00:15.960 --> 00:18.960
Some company is making
a big announcement this weekend.

00:18.960 --> 00:21.000
All you got to do is break the glass
and I'll give you Â£50.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.960
I'll need 100.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.320
It's over 17,000,
you owe Mr Carter now.

00:26.320 --> 00:27.960
You don't want bailiffs
getting involved.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.960
Be very traumatic for the children.

00:29.960 --> 00:32.000
You can't look after them properly.
I think it's best

00:32.000 --> 00:34.640
the girls come with me.
I don't want them hurt.

00:35.960 --> 00:37.960
You spent all of it.

00:37.960 --> 00:39.960
Jess, I'm so sorry.

00:39.960 --> 00:42.800
This 3D company, that's the answer.

00:49.960 --> 00:52.160
It's just bad luck, I guess.

00:52.160 --> 00:55.160
I bet on the wrong company and lost.

00:56.960 --> 00:59.960
Working in the city, I guess that's
just the way it goes, innit?

01:02.960 --> 01:04.800
But I'm gonna win it back.

01:12.960 --> 01:14.960
No more bets. Thank you.

01:20.960 --> 01:23.640
Black 24. Yes!

01:39.960 --> 01:41.000
Final bets?

01:41.000 --> 01:42.960
Sir, final bets?

02:02.000 --> 02:04.480
Winning number here is...

02:04.480 --> 02:05.800
..red 30.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.960
Yes! Sorry, mate.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.320
Hi, Jess. Sorry I'm late.

03:44.320 --> 03:46.960
My alarm didn't go off and I've had
a right nightmare. It's fine.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.960
Oh, Jess?

03:49.960 --> 03:52.960
Just, I'm really
sorry about everything, you know.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.960
I know I messed up.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.320
Jess, please, please. Look at me.

03:57.960 --> 03:59.960
I shouldn't have done what I done,

03:59.960 --> 04:01.960
but I've got something for you.
Look.

04:01.960 --> 04:04.960
Â£800. Just like I promised.
Where'd you get that?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.960
I took it out of Glynn's rent.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.960
Glynn's rent? Don't you need that?

04:09.960 --> 04:12.000
No, no. I'll get by. Please.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.960
I don't want us
falling out over money.

04:14.960 --> 04:17.640
I know this is a poor excuse, but...

04:18.800 --> 04:21.959
..I've been struggling a bit lately.

04:21.959 --> 04:24.960
More than I've been letting on.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.960
I might lose the girls.
I shouldn't have done what I done.

04:27.960 --> 04:29.960
You have every right
to be mad at me,

04:29.960 --> 04:31.960
but please, I promise you,
I won't let you down again.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.960
I love you so much.
You do know that, right?

04:40.960 --> 04:43.960
We're cool, right?

04:43.960 --> 04:45.960
Hey, you two.
I need you to come with me.

04:45.960 --> 04:48.960
What for?
Emergency meeting.

04:50.960 --> 04:54.640
Last week, we discovered
a serious breach of security

04:54.640 --> 04:55.960
in one of the offices.

04:55.960 --> 04:58.960
A listening device was found.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.320
This listening device here.

05:10.960 --> 05:14.960
That's right. The information
in the walls of this building

05:14.960 --> 05:20.160
is of a highly sensitive nature,
so trying to obtain it is a crime.

05:20.160 --> 05:23.960
A crime punishable
by a very long prison sentence.

05:36.960 --> 05:39.960
Now, I don't imagine that anyone
here is responsible,

05:39.960 --> 05:40.960
but I'm asking for your help,

05:40.960 --> 05:43.320
so if any of you have seen
anything like this

05:43.320 --> 05:44.960
or if you have any information

05:44.960 --> 05:48.960
about how we can find the person
responsible, please let us know now.

06:02.960 --> 06:03.960
OK.

06:05.480 --> 06:07.000
So, anything?

06:13.960 --> 06:14.960
No?

06:16.960 --> 06:19.960
OK. Well, thank you for your time.
Thank you.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.960
OK, everybody.
We are 20 minutes behind now.

06:22.960 --> 06:23.960
Back to work.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.960
Don't worry, OK?

06:26.960 --> 06:28.960
There is no way
they're gonna think it's us.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.960
What's the matter?

06:31.960 --> 06:33.480
Jess? What is it?

06:34.960 --> 06:37.480
I found this earlier
in Blake's office.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.960
It was taped underneath his desk.

06:38.960 --> 06:40.960
I know what that is.

06:40.960 --> 06:42.960
That's the phone he was
using to call contacts.

06:42.960 --> 06:43.960
Pass it here.
Well, what for?

06:43.960 --> 06:45.960
Because there'll be all
kinds of info on there.

06:45.960 --> 06:47.800
Deals we don't even know about yet.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.960
We've got to see what's on there,
Jess. Come on.

06:49.960 --> 06:52.960
Er, OK. We can take a look,
but we got to put it back.

06:52.960 --> 06:54.960
You heard what that
compliance woman said.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.960
We could go to prison
for a really long time

06:56.960 --> 06:58.800
if they find out about this.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.480
There is loads of stuff on here.
Look at this.

07:00.480 --> 07:02.960
This property deal
is potentially bigger

07:02.960 --> 07:04.960
than anything else
we've had before.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.960
This could be the one
we've been waiting for.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.960
We just need to figure out
who this Swanny is

07:08.960 --> 07:10.480
and how to get to him.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.960
I knew I shouldn't have taken it.

07:13.960 --> 07:17.320
We should just stop this,
while we still can. Morning, ladies.

07:17.320 --> 07:19.960
You clean on this floor?
Is that right? Yeah.

07:19.960 --> 07:22.000
OK. We need you to come with us
to the compliance office.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.800
Thank you.

07:25.960 --> 07:28.960
This was actually found
in the air-conditioning system

07:28.960 --> 07:29.960
above a desk.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.000
Do you know about that?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.960
Well, we heard something about it,

07:33.960 --> 07:36.960
but we like to keep our noses
out of other people's business.

07:36.960 --> 07:37.960
We're just there to clean.

07:37.960 --> 07:40.000
Yeah, course,
but you may be able to help us.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.480
We need to know if you've seen
anything else like this

07:42.480 --> 07:43.960
anywhere in the office.

07:43.960 --> 07:46.960
No, no. I've not seen
anything like that at all, no.

07:46.960 --> 07:47.960
What about you?

07:48.960 --> 07:51.960
Me?
Doesn't have to be a microphone.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.960
Can be anything you think
might help us.

07:57.960 --> 08:00.000
I haven't seen anything.
Sure?

08:02.960 --> 08:04.480
Yes.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.640
OK. We're done.

08:10.640 --> 08:11.960
Thanks.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.960
I'm gonna go to prison. Oh, Jesus.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.960
What am I doing?
What's my mum gonna do?

08:18.960 --> 08:20.960
You know, I should have just told
them what I know and done with it.

08:20.960 --> 08:23.960
Maybe they'd let us off with
a warning. This is so wrong.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.960
No-one's going to prison.
No-one knows anything.

08:25.960 --> 08:27.960
There's nothing wrong with it.

08:27.960 --> 08:30.960
What? What about the fact
that it's incredibly illegal?

08:30.960 --> 08:31.960
It's a victimless crime.

08:31.960 --> 08:35.960
Look, this is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity to make a fortune.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.320
Come on, this is our big chance!
Chance?

08:38.320 --> 08:39.960
We don't know anything.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.799
You have a phone and it mentioned
something about a property deal.

08:42.799 --> 08:43.960
But we have no details.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.160
You know I'm right, too.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.960
Right.
What are you doing?

08:51.960 --> 08:53.960
I'm gonna talk to the contact,
get the details.

08:53.960 --> 08:56.320
What? You're not gonna call him?
I'm calling Swanny.

08:56.320 --> 08:57.800
No, no, no! Sam!

08:57.800 --> 08:59.960
Find out what this
property deal is about.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.960
What should I do with my voice?

09:02.960 --> 09:04.960
'Hello?'

09:05.960 --> 09:07.960
Is that Swanny?

09:07.960 --> 09:10.960
'Who's asking?'
I'm a friend of Blake's.

09:10.960 --> 09:12.960
'How did you get this number?'

09:12.960 --> 09:15.960
Blake wanted me to call
and let you know that he's all right

09:15.960 --> 09:17.960
and he needs to lie low for now.

09:17.960 --> 09:19.960
You also mentioned something
about a property deal

09:19.960 --> 09:21.960
that you're interested in?

09:21.960 --> 09:23.960
'Who is this?' I just told you.
I'm a friend of Blake's.

09:23.960 --> 09:25.960
I've been helping with the trades.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.960
'Well, then, we should meet.'
You wanna meet?

09:29.960 --> 09:34.960
'Riverside Cafe at South Quay?'
When? '3:30 PM today. OK?'

09:37.960 --> 09:40.640
Yeah. OK, I'll be there.
See you then.

09:55.960 --> 09:58.960
Morning, girls. Are we ready?

09:58.960 --> 10:00.960
Morning. Morning.
What the hell is that?

10:00.960 --> 10:01.960
It's a diesel generator.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.960
It came with the bouncy castle
I just bought on eBay.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.960
What's it doing by the
front door? Can you move it, please?

10:06.960 --> 10:07.960
Yeah, sorry. Will do.

10:07.960 --> 10:09.160
Alice! Lily!

10:09.160 --> 10:11.160
Yeah, down in a sec.

10:11.160 --> 10:14.320
Lily. Why aren't you dressed?

10:14.320 --> 10:16.960
Come on, darling, we need to leave.

10:16.960 --> 10:19.480
I don't feel so good, Mum.
What's the matter?

10:19.480 --> 10:21.960
Have you been sick?
You haven't got a temperature.

10:22.960 --> 10:25.960
My tummy. It's really sore.

10:25.960 --> 10:26.960
OK. Well, I've got to go to work.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.960
You think you're well enough
to come with me?

10:29.960 --> 10:30.960
OK. Good girl.

10:36.960 --> 10:40.000
Mum, I can't see the TV.

10:41.320 --> 10:43.960
LAUGHS
I'm sorry, m'lady.

10:43.960 --> 10:46.960
We can't have you watching cartoons
through a dusty screen now, can we?

10:48.320 --> 10:49.960
Mum?
Mm?

10:49.960 --> 10:52.960
Do you think one day we could get
a massive TV like this one?

10:53.960 --> 10:55.640
Er...yeah. Maybe.

10:56.480 --> 10:59.960
One day. Come on.
You wanna give Mummy a hand?

11:00.640 --> 11:02.960
...I went to the toilet, someone had
written 'Lily Cook smells'

11:02.960 --> 11:05.960
in the mirror in green highlighter.
It won't come off.

11:05.960 --> 11:07.960
Even with soap.

11:07.960 --> 11:08.960
When was this?

11:08.960 --> 11:11.960
Yesterday.
I just knew it was Jadine.

11:11.960 --> 11:13.160
Did you ask her?

11:13.160 --> 11:16.960
No, but when she was on break,
I took her lunchbox out of her bag

11:16.960 --> 11:19.000
and stomped on her sandwiches.
Lily!

11:19.000 --> 11:22.960
What?
That is very, very naughty, OK?

11:22.960 --> 11:24.960
Don't stamp on people's sandwiches.

11:24.960 --> 11:27.960
That's sneaky and horrible.
I want you to apologise to Jadine.

11:27.960 --> 11:30.960
She doesn't know it was me.
I don't care.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.960
That's not how I brought you up, OK?

11:32.960 --> 11:36.320
I want you to tell her it was you
and I want you to say sorry.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.960
OK.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.000
Harrogate.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.960
Cookson and Williams.

12:46.960 --> 12:49.800
Hey, Mum? Where'd you get that?

12:49.800 --> 12:52.960
Oh. This. I borrowed it
from a friend. What do you think?

12:53.960 --> 12:56.640
Yeah. Are you leaving for work now?
Yeah, yeah.

12:56.640 --> 12:58.640
I need to be
somewhere before I start,

12:58.640 --> 13:01.320
so I'm leaving a little
earlier today. Oh, right.

13:02.960 --> 13:03.960
Er...
What's the matter?

13:05.960 --> 13:07.960
I found this in the kitchen.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.480
Why do you have it?

13:10.480 --> 13:13.000
Erm...you know I like to play
those online games now and again?

13:13.000 --> 13:14.960
Someone gave me that as a joke.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.960
Is that really why?
Yeah.

13:17.960 --> 13:21.960
Course. What, your dad hasn't
said anything, has he?

13:22.960 --> 13:25.960
Like what? Nothing. Nothing.
There's nothing to say.

13:28.480 --> 13:30.960
Darling, what's wrong?
Nothing.

13:30.960 --> 13:32.320
I just...

13:33.160 --> 13:35.960
You know, if you do need to talk
about this or whatever...

13:35.960 --> 13:39.960
you can talk to me.

13:39.960 --> 13:41.960
Sweetheart, I don't need to talk
about anything

13:41.960 --> 13:44.800
cos there's nothing to talk about.
But thank you anyway.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.000
I love you.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
I'll see you later on, OK?

13:48.000 --> 13:49.960
OK.

13:57.960 --> 14:00.160
Yeah. No, I know that.

14:00.160 --> 14:02.960
Did you have a word with him?

14:02.960 --> 14:03.960
He's not listening to me, no.

14:03.960 --> 14:06.960
The thing is, right, he needs
to diversify his portfolio.

14:06.960 --> 14:09.960
He's too tied up in one sector.

14:09.960 --> 14:12.640
His problem is
he has no long-term perspective.

14:13.800 --> 14:14.960
Yeah.

14:14.960 --> 14:17.960
He needs to not get freaked out
the first hint of volatility.

14:17.960 --> 14:19.960
I mean, what's his problem?

14:29.960 --> 14:30.960
SIGHS

14:50.960 --> 14:53.960
Yeah, well, I told him he needs
to diversify his portfolio.

14:54.960 --> 14:57.960
Yeah, well his problem is
he has no long-term perspective.

14:58.960 --> 15:00.960
Even Blake told him
not to get freaked out

15:00.960 --> 15:03.160
at the first hint of volatility.

15:03.160 --> 15:06.960
Look, I'm gonna have to go because
I've got to meet someone about now.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.960
A possible investment opportunity.
Yeah.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.960
Yeah, we'll talk later.

15:14.960 --> 15:15.960
Swanny?

15:18.320 --> 15:20.480
Why don't you come
and sit over here?

15:34.960 --> 15:35.960
OK.

15:36.960 --> 15:38.960
So, who are you?

15:38.960 --> 15:40.960
I told you. I'm a friend of Blake's.

15:41.960 --> 15:43.960
You got a name?

15:43.960 --> 15:44.960
Nancy.

15:46.640 --> 15:47.960
OK, Nancy.

15:48.960 --> 15:51.320
So, what do you know?
I know about it all.

15:51.320 --> 15:52.960
The investments, everything.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.640
What investments?

15:56.960 --> 16:00.640
In March, you invested 30,000
into Harrogate Pharmacology.

16:00.640 --> 16:02.960
You made 63,000.

16:02.960 --> 16:03.960
Then it was Franklin Bingham.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.960
Osprex. Bevan Brothers Steel.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.960
I mean, I could go on and on.

16:08.960 --> 16:09.960
It's all done very carefully.

16:09.960 --> 16:12.000
The money is spread thinly
across several accounts.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
I know all this because
I've been helping Blake

16:14.000 --> 16:17.480
from the very beginning.
I'm his silent partner.

16:18.960 --> 16:20.960
How do I know you're not the FCA?

16:20.960 --> 16:23.640
Because if I was the FCA,
I think you'd most likely

16:23.640 --> 16:25.960
be having this conversation
in a pair of handcuffs right now.

16:26.960 --> 16:29.960
Blake's gonna keep his mouth shut.
You don't need to worry.

16:29.960 --> 16:30.960
I know he will.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.960
Before we go any further...

16:37.160 --> 16:39.160
..I think you should
meet with Graham.

16:39.160 --> 16:40.960
He'll want to talk things through.

16:40.960 --> 16:42.320
About the property deal?

16:43.960 --> 16:45.960
Maybe.

16:45.960 --> 16:47.960
OK. When?

16:47.960 --> 16:48.960
You, erm...

16:48.960 --> 16:50.000
..you got a burner phone?

16:51.960 --> 16:55.000
Yeah. I tell you what,
I'll text you.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.800
Then you'll have the number.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.960
You did what?
I met him.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.800
I told him I knew Blake
and that's how I know everything.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.960
He didn't go into the property deal,
but he does wanna meet again.

17:32.960 --> 17:34.800
With Graham this time.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.960
That name keeps popping up
on Blake's burner phone,

17:36.960 --> 17:38.960
which has been amazing.
He's gonna take us right inside.

17:38.960 --> 17:40.960
You're not seriously gonna meet him?

17:42.960 --> 17:45.960
Sam, what you gonna do when
they start asking real questions?

17:45.960 --> 17:46.960
You don't know anything!

17:47.960 --> 17:50.800
OK, look, I'm begging you now.
Don't do this.

17:50.800 --> 17:51.960
Think about the girls.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.960
What will they do
if something happens to you?

17:54.960 --> 17:56.320
OK, look.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.160
We gave it a go
and we made a bit of money.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.960
I've got a meeting with the bank,
you know, about my van,

18:00.960 --> 18:01.960
so I'll figure something out.

18:02.960 --> 18:05.480
Just promise me,
promise me you won't do this.

18:05.480 --> 18:07.640
Please? It's too dangerous.

18:09.960 --> 18:11.320
OK.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.960
I went through the footage,
but there isn't a camera

18:15.960 --> 18:18.960
on the corridor, so we don't know
what happened.

18:18.960 --> 18:20.480
We've chalked it up as an accident.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.960
How about the cameras on the
stairwells? Have you checked those?

18:22.960 --> 18:25.960
Of course. But you can't see
the alarm from there.

18:25.960 --> 18:27.960
SHE SIGHS
Look, do you think maybe you could

18:27.960 --> 18:29.960
run me off a copy of the CCTV
footage so I can take a look?

19:04.960 --> 19:06.960
Oh.

19:06.960 --> 19:09.160
That's where all that orange
juice is going, is it?

19:09.160 --> 19:11.960
Oh, sorry. I can buy some more.

19:11.960 --> 19:13.800
Maybe I'll get
the one without bits next time.

19:14.960 --> 19:15.960
Oh.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.800
Mum?

19:24.800 --> 19:25.960
Mum, I don't feel too good.

19:25.960 --> 19:28.960
No, you are not having
another day off school.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.960
You need to apologise to Jadine
today, like we said, OK?

19:32.960 --> 19:35.960
I've got parents evening tonight,
so you need to come home with Alice.

19:35.960 --> 19:37.960
Now, go get changed, please.
We need to leave.

19:49.960 --> 19:51.960
She totally shut me down.

19:51.960 --> 19:53.480
Complete denial, I think.

19:53.480 --> 19:56.960
Yeah. My uncle, he had a drinking
problem and he was the same.

19:56.960 --> 19:57.960
Really?
Yeah.

19:59.960 --> 20:01.960
It's hard, cos they can only
really help themselves,

20:01.960 --> 20:04.640
but he did get help, though.
Through one of those groups.

20:04.640 --> 20:05.960
You know what else helped?

20:05.960 --> 20:07.960
What?
Fitness training.

20:07.960 --> 20:09.960
He started working out,
and that's how I got into boxing

20:09.960 --> 20:11.960
in the first place,
through my uncle.

20:15.960 --> 20:18.000
Have you thought any
more about training yet?

20:18.000 --> 20:19.960
Nah, not yet.

20:19.960 --> 20:22.960
If my mum found out you were
paying for it, she might freak out.

20:24.960 --> 20:26.960
I wanna help you because I like you.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.960
You know that, right?

20:40.800 --> 20:43.640
Oh, hey. What you doing here?

20:43.640 --> 20:45.960
Just getting a hot chocolate.

20:45.960 --> 20:47.320
I didn't know you worked here.

20:47.320 --> 20:48.960
Oh, yeah, well, it's my mum's place.

20:48.960 --> 20:52.960
I've been working here
since I was about 15.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.960
How did you get on with the, erm...

20:55.960 --> 20:58.320
thing I sorted for you?

20:58.320 --> 21:00.160
We couldn't really hear
anything in the end.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.960
I think there was something wrong
with the microphone.

21:02.960 --> 21:05.960
Anyway, I was just being silly.
It wasn't the best mic in the world.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.960
I could definitely get
you something better.

21:07.960 --> 21:09.960
Oh, no, no. I don't want you
going through any trouble.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.640
Honestly, I was just being paranoid.

21:11.640 --> 21:15.960
Everything's fine. It's no trouble.
I can make it really discreet.

21:15.960 --> 21:17.960
No. It's OK.

21:17.960 --> 21:20.960
Well, maybe I'll just make it
anyway, and if you wanna use it,

21:20.960 --> 21:22.960
you can use it.

21:24.960 --> 21:26.960
Fine. OK.

21:26.960 --> 21:29.320
Thanks.
Cool.

21:32.960 --> 21:35.960
Who was that?

21:35.960 --> 21:37.960
Seems like a nice boy.

21:37.960 --> 21:39.960
Oh, nobody. Just a friend of Sam's.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.960
OK. Those go over there.

22:04.960 --> 22:06.960
I traded in that car of yours.

22:06.960 --> 22:08.960
Â£200 I got, scrap metal price.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.960
Yeah, well,
you're not having my rings.

22:10.960 --> 22:13.960
Just give me a couple more weeks,
I'll be able to...

22:13.960 --> 22:15.960
No. You either hand over
your rings, or I'll ask you

22:15.960 --> 22:17.960
to do something I know
you don't want to.

22:17.960 --> 22:18.960
Yeah, what's that?

22:21.960 --> 22:23.960
That nice house
you clean in Dulwich.

22:23.960 --> 22:24.960
Would it really be so terrible

22:24.960 --> 22:26.960
if you forgot to lock up
after yourself tomorrow?

22:29.640 --> 22:30.960
I can't do that.

22:30.960 --> 22:33.960
You might not want to,
but you most certainly can.

22:33.960 --> 22:36.960
Or I'll tell Mr Carter that you're
refusing to pay, then it's bailiffs,

22:36.960 --> 22:38.960
court hearings, God knows what else.

22:38.960 --> 22:40.480
You think I'll let you
steal from people

22:40.480 --> 22:41.960
who trust me to clean their houses?

22:41.960 --> 22:43.960
Well, at the moment,
you're stealing from us.

22:43.960 --> 22:45.960
Believe me, that has far
worse repercussions for you

22:45.960 --> 22:47.000
and your family.

22:48.960 --> 22:49.960
This is the easiest way out of this.

23:06.480 --> 23:08.960
Hey.
Hey.

23:10.480 --> 23:13.960
How did the job interview go?
Good, yeah.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.960
Just, erm, waiting to hear back.

23:17.960 --> 23:20.640
Just looking at this family
portrait that Lily's drawn.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.960
Who's the guy
in the washing machine?

23:24.960 --> 23:27.960
Oh. I haven't the foggiest idea.

23:28.960 --> 23:31.960
She's got such
a wonderful imagination.

23:31.960 --> 23:35.960
Her reading age is at least a couple
of years ahead of what we'd expect.

23:35.960 --> 23:39.960
Her maths could be better,
but she's improving all the time.

23:39.960 --> 23:42.960
Creatively, though,
she really is quite exceptional.

23:42.960 --> 23:45.960
Do either of you have
any interest in the arts?

23:45.960 --> 23:48.160
I used to be a dancer.
I imagine she probably gets

23:48.160 --> 23:50.960
her creative side from me. I'm not
sure about your drawing, though.

23:50.960 --> 23:52.960
You can't draw to save your life.

23:52.960 --> 23:55.800
She doesn't get it from you, that's
for sure. I'm not saying she does.

23:55.800 --> 23:58.000
Either way, it's definitely
something we should be encouraging.

23:59.960 --> 24:02.960
I do need to talk about some
other things, though.

24:03.960 --> 24:07.800
Since we spoke, Sam,
Lily's been better.

24:07.800 --> 24:11.960
But she does have
a tendency to provoke Jadine Robins.

24:11.960 --> 24:13.960
Provoke?
Provoke?

24:13.960 --> 24:16.960
Teases, torments.
That kind of thing.

24:16.960 --> 24:19.480
She bullies Jadine?
Is that what you're saying?

24:19.480 --> 24:21.960
It's the other way round.
My daughter is not a bully.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.960
You should be having this
conversation with Jadine's parents.

24:24.960 --> 24:27.960
Jadine isn't completely
blameless in all of this. No.

24:27.960 --> 24:31.960
But... I think Lily's
home life may be playing a part.

24:32.960 --> 24:34.160
What do you mean?

24:34.160 --> 24:37.000
She's made me aware
of your separation.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.960
I know that due to your current
work patterns,

24:39.960 --> 24:43.960
Lily spends many evenings
with just her sister for company.

24:43.960 --> 24:48.960
From my experience, these things can
sometimes be a cry for attention.

24:53.960 --> 24:54.960
Sam?

24:55.960 --> 24:58.960
Where are you going now?
Do you have work? Later, why?

24:58.960 --> 25:01.960
I need to talk to you
about something. Time for a drink?

25:01.960 --> 25:03.960
Er, I need to get
back for the girls.

25:03.960 --> 25:05.960
It'll only take half an hour.

25:06.960 --> 25:08.960
So, do they know what it is?

25:08.960 --> 25:12.480
Emphysema. You know,
from all the smoking.

25:12.480 --> 25:15.960
Could I go and visit her?
Yeah, course. She'd love that.

25:15.960 --> 25:17.960
You know what my mum's like.

25:18.960 --> 25:19.960
So, when did you last have a fag?

25:19.960 --> 25:21.960
Well, this is the joke of it.

25:21.960 --> 25:23.960
She could have had one this
morning for all I know. What?

25:23.960 --> 25:26.960
Yeah. The nurse caught her
wheeling her drip to the back door

25:26.960 --> 25:29.960
with a packet of fags
stuck down her dressing gown.

25:29.960 --> 25:32.960
"You need to go to bed, Mary."
"I need a fag!"

25:32.960 --> 25:34.960
God, that's terrible!

25:34.960 --> 25:36.960
Do you remember when we had
to cancel our flight to Egypt?

25:36.960 --> 25:38.960
She said she wouldn't
last the flight.

25:38.960 --> 25:40.960
We ended up on
a coach trip to the south of France.

25:40.960 --> 25:43.960
Oh, God. The hole in the ground.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.960
Oh, yeah!
"There's no toilet in here, Sam,

25:45.960 --> 25:47.160
just a bloody hole
in the ground!"

25:47.160 --> 25:49.320
"Well, crouch over it."
"What, with my knees?"

25:49.320 --> 25:51.960
Didn't you..?
Yeah, I went in with her!

25:51.960 --> 25:54.320
Holding her arms while she was
doing her business in a hole

25:54.320 --> 25:55.960
in the middle
of the French countryside!

25:55.960 --> 25:58.960
That's an image I'll never forget!

25:58.960 --> 26:02.960
Remember, we used to sit on my mum
and dad's balcony every night,

26:02.960 --> 26:04.960
playing poker with them
till the early hours?

26:10.960 --> 26:13.480
Yeah. Anyway, I better get going.

26:13.480 --> 26:14.960
Make sure you tell her
I'll drop in, OK?

26:14.960 --> 26:17.640
It's been too long
since we've seen each other.

26:17.640 --> 26:20.160
Actually, Sam, there's something
else I need to talk to you about.

26:22.160 --> 26:23.960
Oh. What?

26:24.960 --> 26:27.960
The rental contract's up
on the house.

26:27.960 --> 26:29.960
So, the landlady asked
if you're gonna stay.

26:31.320 --> 26:32.960
What did you say?

26:32.960 --> 26:34.960
I said I didn't know.
That she should speak to you.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.960
Sam, in an ideal world,
you and I would be living together.

26:38.960 --> 26:40.960
And everything would be fine.

26:40.960 --> 26:42.960
But it's not worked out that way,
has it?

26:43.960 --> 26:46.960
You can't expect me to pay rent
on a house I'm not living in.

26:46.960 --> 26:49.960
So where am I supposed to go?

26:49.960 --> 26:51.320
You'll work summat out.

26:52.960 --> 26:55.160
I've got a rental agreement
with Beth.

26:55.160 --> 26:56.800
So...

26:57.480 --> 26:59.160
..the girls will
have to live with me,

26:59.160 --> 27:01.960
because that is their only option.

27:01.960 --> 27:02.960
That's not happening.

27:05.960 --> 27:08.960
Why's he got to be so loud?

27:10.960 --> 27:12.960
Alice?
Yeah?

27:12.960 --> 27:14.960
Where do you like it most?
Here with Mum,

27:14.960 --> 27:15.960
or at Dad's house with Beth?

27:16.960 --> 27:18.960
Dunno.

27:18.960 --> 27:21.960
I get to go out more at Dad's,
but then Beth's there, so...

27:21.960 --> 27:25.960
I like Beth. I just don't like
being away from Mum.

27:25.960 --> 27:27.960
Do you reckon
we could all live together?

27:28.960 --> 27:32.800
No. Hi, girls.
Mum.

27:32.800 --> 27:34.640
What did Miss Evans say?

27:34.640 --> 27:35.960
Well, she said you're trying
really hard,

27:35.960 --> 27:38.960
but if your maths doesn't improve,
you're gonna have to stay behind

27:38.960 --> 27:41.800
and repeat year four.
That's all right, right?

27:42.640 --> 27:44.960
Got you!

27:44.960 --> 27:46.480
She said you were brilliant.

27:46.480 --> 27:48.480
But we already knew that, didn't we?

27:48.480 --> 27:51.320
Alice, sweetheart,
there's a pizza in the freezer, OK?

27:51.320 --> 27:53.320
I'm running late for work.
I've got to get ready.

28:58.960 --> 28:59.960
Hello?

28:59.960 --> 29:01.960
You get my message about Tuesday?

29:01.960 --> 29:04.960
Yes. Sorry I haven't replied.
I've been busy.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.960
Well, you gonna be there?

29:07.960 --> 29:10.960
Er, yeah, I don't think I'm gonna
be able to make that actually.

29:10.960 --> 29:12.960
I think I might have something on.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.960
'Look, if you're not interested,
don't waste our time.'

29:14.960 --> 29:17.960
We need to move on this.

29:17.960 --> 29:20.960
OK, well, erm, let me check what
I'm doing and I'll get back to you.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.960
'All right. Just let me know
as soon you can, all right?'

29:23.960 --> 29:24.960
OK, will do. Bye.

29:49.960 --> 29:52.960
Are we on?
No. I can't do it.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.960
I'm not letting you steal
from people

29:54.960 --> 29:56.960
who trust me with their homes.
I can't.

29:56.960 --> 29:59.960
That's very disappointing.
Wait. There's another way.

29:59.960 --> 30:03.000
Listen, look.
I have insider information.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.960
The office where I work,
there's a stockbroker there.

30:05.960 --> 30:08.960
I can get my hands on stock market
info before it goes public.

30:08.960 --> 30:10.640
I'm not lying this time.
This is the truth.

30:10.640 --> 30:11.960
Right.

30:13.640 --> 30:16.960
I have heard
some tall tales in my time.

30:16.960 --> 30:18.960
But that is a new one.
No. Wait!

30:21.960 --> 30:23.960
SIGHS

30:25.960 --> 30:28.960
We've got bags of experience.
Clement's Cafe?

30:28.960 --> 30:30.800
You know, on the high street?

30:30.800 --> 30:34.000
That's been a cornerstone
of the community for 25 years.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.960
The other reason we are moving is
cos the rents have gone too high.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.960
But this way,
we don't have to worry about that.

30:38.960 --> 30:40.960
Without the huge overheads,

30:40.960 --> 30:43.960
we're looking at an 80% mark-up
on each cup of coffee.

30:43.960 --> 30:48.960
If we shift around 150 a day,
we're looking at a gross profit

30:48.960 --> 30:51.960
of between 1,000 and 1,200 per week.

30:52.960 --> 30:54.160
I know what you're thinking.

30:54.160 --> 30:57.960
"Why go to our van when you could
just go to Starbucks", right?

30:57.960 --> 30:59.960
Here's your answer. Our cakes.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.480
Have a taste.

31:02.480 --> 31:04.960
I brought them for you to try.
No, thanks. I've just eaten.

31:04.960 --> 31:09.960
So, where will this coffee and cake
van go to find its customers?

31:09.960 --> 31:11.960
Oh, well. I work in Canary Wharf,

31:11.960 --> 31:15.960
and there's loads of mobile
food vans by the water.

31:15.960 --> 31:17.960
I was aiming to get
a residency along there.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.320
Mm.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.960
So, it was a no, was it?

31:37.960 --> 31:39.960
Well, I can't say I'm surprised.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.960
Who wants cakes from a van?

31:42.960 --> 31:45.960
I'm not sure you thought
that one through properly.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.960
I, on the other hand,
have a better idea.

31:53.960 --> 31:55.960
How's about...

31:55.960 --> 31:59.960
we still buy the van...but
instead, I do deliveries with it?

32:00.960 --> 32:04.320
You know, like a white van man
for hire?

32:06.960 --> 32:08.960
What you reckon?

32:10.960 --> 32:12.960
Hey. I'm here to see Mary Cook,
please.

32:14.960 --> 32:16.960
Thank you.

32:23.960 --> 32:26.960
They've bleedin' well taken them
off me, haven't they?

32:26.960 --> 32:28.320
Well, I'm getting them
back before I leave.

32:28.320 --> 32:30.960
Nine pounds I pay for those fags.
THEY LAUGH

32:32.960 --> 32:33.960
You haven't got any, have you?

32:33.960 --> 32:37.960
No! I've quit.
Not good for our health, are they?

32:37.960 --> 32:39.960
I know!

32:41.800 --> 32:42.960
How are you, anyway?

32:42.960 --> 32:45.960
Oh, yeah. You know, I'm OK. Yeah.

32:45.960 --> 32:48.960
No. Don't do that.

32:48.960 --> 32:49.960
How are you?

32:51.960 --> 32:54.000
Not good.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.960
But I'm trying to make
things better. And you will.

33:02.160 --> 33:04.320
I can't believe Lily's
going to be nine.

33:04.320 --> 33:07.960
I know.
It all flies by so quickly.

33:09.160 --> 33:12.160
I want you to treat her
to something.

33:12.160 --> 33:15.640
An early birthday present
for being such a clever girl.

33:15.640 --> 33:17.160
Go on.

33:18.640 --> 33:19.960
You'll know what to get her.

33:19.960 --> 33:22.320
Thanks, Mary.

33:34.960 --> 33:35.960
Cheers.

33:36.960 --> 33:39.960
Er, can I get five scratchcards,
please? Number eight.

33:40.960 --> 33:41.960
Actually, can you make that 10?

33:41.960 --> 33:43.000
Mm-hm.

33:45.640 --> 33:47.960
That's Â£20. Anything else?

33:47.960 --> 33:49.960
No.

33:49.960 --> 33:53.960
Sorry, actually,
can I get five more, please? Yeah.

34:17.159 --> 34:20.960
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

34:29.960 --> 34:31.960
I apologised for stamping
on her sandwiches

34:31.960 --> 34:33.960
and she wasn't even that cross.

34:33.960 --> 34:36.960
Then Jadine taught me
how to double Dutch with a rope. Oh.

34:36.960 --> 34:39.800
She's actually really good at it.

34:39.800 --> 34:41.960
Her parents split up, too.

34:41.960 --> 34:43.960
That was when she was little.

34:43.960 --> 34:45.960
She even asked
if I could go round for tea one day.

34:45.960 --> 34:47.960
Yeah, if you'd like to.
I'd love to.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.960
Look. I've got something for you.

34:49.960 --> 34:51.960
Granny Cook wanted to get you
a present for being a clever girl

34:51.960 --> 34:53.960
on your school report.
Really?

34:53.960 --> 34:55.320
I don't have to open it
on my birthday?

34:55.320 --> 34:56.960
You can have it now.

35:01.960 --> 35:03.320
It's a troll.

35:03.320 --> 35:04.960
Can play with its hair and stuff.

35:04.960 --> 35:07.960
Oh. Yeah.

35:07.960 --> 35:09.960
Thanks.

35:09.960 --> 35:11.960
I'll play with it later.

35:47.960 --> 35:50.320
Jess! Jess.

35:50.320 --> 35:52.320
I need to talk to you.

35:52.320 --> 35:55.960
Look. I've been thinking about
what you said about the meeting.

35:55.960 --> 35:59.960
I know you don't agree,
but I think I'm gonna go.

36:00.960 --> 36:02.960
I just don't see how
anything's gonna change

36:02.960 --> 36:04.960
unless we take these chances.

36:04.960 --> 36:07.960
Going to the meeting
is obviously risky,

36:07.960 --> 36:11.960
but if we don't go,
then that means we are giving in.

36:11.960 --> 36:15.640
And the last thing
we are is quitters. Right?

36:17.960 --> 36:20.160
The bank turned me down
for a business loan today.

36:21.960 --> 36:23.960
Said loaning me
the money was too risky.

36:25.960 --> 36:26.960
So, you know what?

36:28.640 --> 36:30.960
Bollocks to 'em.

36:30.960 --> 36:32.960
I'll get the money on my own.

36:32.960 --> 36:34.960
Let's do this.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.960
Argh!

36:37.960 --> 36:40.160
Yes, girl! Come on.

36:44.480 --> 36:46.960
Right. I just want us to be
as prepared as possible,

36:46.960 --> 36:48.960
do you know what I mean? Oh, Mina.

36:48.960 --> 36:52.800
I know what you're gonna say,
but I haven't got it on me, sorry.

36:52.800 --> 36:54.800
I'm not here for the money.

36:54.800 --> 36:55.960
I want to know what's going on.

36:55.960 --> 36:56.960
What's going on with what?

36:56.960 --> 36:58.960
That listening device
that was found.

36:59.960 --> 37:01.960
I think you two had
something to do with it.

37:01.960 --> 37:05.960
Now, I don't have to tell
anybody about the fire alarm...

37:05.960 --> 37:07.800
What fire alarm?

37:07.800 --> 37:09.960
I don't know what you're
talking about. Oh, I think you do.

37:10.960 --> 37:14.800
I'm going to tell that
compliance woman everything I know

37:14.800 --> 37:16.960
unless you tell me.
What's going on?

37:26.960 --> 37:28.960
What will you do if it's a trick?

37:28.960 --> 37:31.960
If they know you're not
who you say you are?

37:31.960 --> 37:32.960
What if police are there

37:32.960 --> 37:35.640
or if someone's waiting
to give you a fist sandwich?

37:35.640 --> 37:36.960
Fist sandwich? What the hell's that?

37:36.960 --> 37:39.960
I think she means
a knuckle sandwich.

37:39.960 --> 37:41.960
But none of that is gonna happen,
OK? I'm gonna be fine.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.960
Why don't I go with you?
Hang on, what?

37:44.960 --> 37:46.320
In case something goes wrong.

37:46.320 --> 37:48.960
Wait a minute, who says you're even
involved? This is our thing.

37:48.960 --> 37:50.960
I'm saying I want to be part of it.

37:50.960 --> 37:52.960
I can be useful to you.
How?

37:52.960 --> 37:55.160
You know I was a language teacher.
I can translate things.

37:55.160 --> 37:56.960
Oh, yeah. That's just
what we need (!)

37:56.960 --> 37:58.960
If the brokers were speaking
in Serbian,

37:58.960 --> 38:00.960
you might come in handy,
but they're not.

38:00.960 --> 38:02.960
They speak in English,
and we can handle that.

38:02.960 --> 38:05.640
I really don't think
you have a choice.

38:05.640 --> 38:07.800
I can tell police everything
you just told me.

38:10.960 --> 38:13.480
SIGHS

38:14.960 --> 38:16.960
Investors in the stock market
will build up

38:16.960 --> 38:20.960
a large and varied
investment portfolio.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.960
The portfolio is a collection
of shares that an individual

38:22.960 --> 38:24.640
has in various investments.

38:24.640 --> 38:26.960
How did he take the news
about the downturn?

38:26.960 --> 38:28.960
I told him it was
the nature of the bad market.

38:28.960 --> 38:31.320
Got to wait for this
pool to come roaring back.

38:31.320 --> 38:34.800
Bear market is one which
stocks are continually falling,

38:34.800 --> 38:38.960
Whereas a bull market is when stocks
are continuously on the rise.

38:38.960 --> 38:41.960
Well, if we look at the data, we are
only talking about a 5% yield.

38:41.960 --> 38:43.960
The annual dividend, yeah.

38:45.960 --> 38:48.480
The yield is the income
returned on an investment.

38:48.480 --> 38:51.960
The dividend is usually distributed
among shareholders

38:51.960 --> 38:53.960
as cash or shares.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.960
When a company goes public,

38:59.960 --> 39:03.960
they will hold an IPO -
an initial public offering.

39:06.960 --> 39:09.960
IPOs are usually
offered by smaller companies

39:09.960 --> 39:11.960
that are looking to expand
their business,

39:11.960 --> 39:16.960
and this is how a private company
becomes a publicly owned company.

39:16.960 --> 39:19.800
IPOs are usually offered
smaller companies

39:19.800 --> 39:21.960
looking to grow their business.
That's right, babe.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.960
How's the voice?
Yeah, I like it!

39:24.960 --> 39:26.960
What are blue chips?

39:26.960 --> 39:30.960
Blue chips are the big,
stable companies like Apple,

39:30.960 --> 39:33.960
and they can withstand
volatility in the market.

39:33.960 --> 39:36.480
That's really good. I can't believe
how much you've learnt.

39:36.480 --> 39:37.960
It's good. Really.

39:37.960 --> 39:41.000
But what's important is that
you look like a stockbroker.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.960
What are you going to wear?

39:42.960 --> 39:45.960
Oh, I dunno. I'm sure
I've got something suitable.

39:58.960 --> 40:01.480
All right? Hey.
Is Sam in?

40:01.480 --> 40:03.480
Er, yeah. She's, er...
Great.

40:03.480 --> 40:05.960
..just upstairs.

40:05.960 --> 40:09.960
Sam?
I'll be down in a minute.

40:10.960 --> 40:12.960
Oh, hey, whilst you're here,
I've got something for you.

40:14.960 --> 40:17.960
This is a listening device
that I made from an old phone.

40:18.960 --> 40:20.960
Looks like it's switched off, right?
Er, yeah.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.160
Well, watch what happens
when I dial it.

40:30.960 --> 40:32.960
Not doing anything.

40:32.960 --> 40:35.960
Well, exactly, but it is. Listen.

40:36.960 --> 40:39.960
Hello, this is Glynn speaking.
Can you hear me?

40:39.960 --> 40:42.960
Yeah, I can, Glynn, but that's cos
you're stood right in front of me.

40:42.960 --> 40:44.960
Just cover your other ear.

40:47.160 --> 40:49.960
Your eyes can deceive you.

40:49.960 --> 40:51.000
Don't trust them.

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
Let go of your conscious self
and act on instinct.

40:56.800 --> 40:57.960
Obi Wan Kenobi.

40:57.960 --> 40:59.960
Yeah.

40:59.960 --> 41:02.480
Anyway, when you wanna stop
listening, you just end the call,

41:02.480 --> 41:04.960
it just sits there like an old phone
that someone's forgotten about.

41:04.960 --> 41:08.960
Yeah, you know, I'm not sure
that I need this any more.

41:08.960 --> 41:10.960
But, you know, thanks anyway.

41:10.960 --> 41:12.960
Oh, hey. I had a half day,

41:12.960 --> 41:15.320
so I stopped round my mum's house
to raid her wardrobe.

41:15.320 --> 41:18.960
Get some clothes. I think
you're about the same height. Great.

41:18.960 --> 41:19.960
Another interview?

41:19.960 --> 41:22.960
Yeah, yeah. Something like that.

41:24.480 --> 41:26.960
I'll get it.

41:26.960 --> 41:29.160
Erm...
What do you think?

41:29.160 --> 41:32.960
Marks and Sparks.
But simple and elegant.

41:32.960 --> 41:33.960
Look, Mina rang this morning.

41:33.960 --> 41:36.960
She said she has some clothes for me
to try on, so I've invited her over.

41:36.960 --> 41:39.960
Oh, great, yeah. Nice.
Where was my invite?

41:39.960 --> 41:41.960
I thought you were at work. Sorry.
Hey, girls.

41:41.960 --> 41:44.960
Hey. Are you ready
for a fashion parade?

41:44.960 --> 41:46.320
Do you know what I have here?

41:46.320 --> 41:47.960
All designer.

41:47.960 --> 41:50.960
I know this guy who can get it for
crazy cheap prices on Brick Lane.

41:52.960 --> 41:54.960
Replicas, but nobody can tell.

41:56.960 --> 41:58.000
Let's have a look, then.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.960
Wait for it, wait for it. OK.

42:03.960 --> 42:05.960
What do you think?

42:05.960 --> 42:07.000
Hmm.
Wow.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.320
I'm not saying you don't look good,
but it's a bit...

42:10.960 --> 42:12.160
..you know...flashy.

42:12.160 --> 42:15.960
Look, you're much better off with a
Marks and Spencer shirt and blazer.

42:15.960 --> 42:17.960
She can't go in that.

42:17.960 --> 42:20.800
She has to stress to impress.

42:20.800 --> 42:21.960
You mean dress to impress?

42:21.960 --> 42:22.960
Yeah, exactly.

42:22.960 --> 42:24.960
What she wears tells who she is.

42:24.960 --> 42:26.960
Yeah, and that's some
cheap replica knock-off.

42:26.960 --> 42:28.960
I don't think that's the statement
she wants to make.

42:28.960 --> 42:32.960
Don't be silly. Look at her.
She looks fabulous.

42:32.960 --> 42:35.160
Now she is Nancy.

42:35.160 --> 42:36.960
I think Mina's right.

42:36.960 --> 42:38.960
I already feel like a stockbroker.

42:38.960 --> 42:42.960
I'll knock 'em dead in this.

42:42.960 --> 42:44.960
Oh, no.

42:44.960 --> 42:45.960
It's a message from Swanny.

42:45.960 --> 42:48.960
The time's changed.
He wants to meet earlier now.

42:48.960 --> 42:49.960
He wants to meet at seven.

42:49.960 --> 42:51.960
You'll be fine.

43:07.960 --> 43:08.960
Hey.

43:08.960 --> 43:10.960
Hey.

43:10.960 --> 43:12.960
So, I know you don't wanna
talk about this,

43:12.960 --> 43:16.960
but I was looking at the
Gamblers Anonymous thing again,

43:16.960 --> 43:20.800
and they actually do groups where
family members can come, too.

43:20.800 --> 43:22.960
So, I was thinking...

43:22.960 --> 43:23.960
maybe we could go?

43:23.960 --> 43:26.960
No. I've already said, sweetheart.
It's not really my thing.

43:26.960 --> 43:29.000
I know you said that,
but what harm would it do by going?

43:29.000 --> 43:31.960
Darling, look. I haven't time
to talk about this right now.

43:31.960 --> 43:33.960
I need to get ready.

43:33.960 --> 43:36.960
I think it could be useful,
just to see what they have to say.

43:36.960 --> 43:38.960
I haven't got time to talk, darling.

43:38.960 --> 43:41.960
What do you think, though?
I don't know. I need to get ready.

43:41.960 --> 43:43.960
Sorry.

44:18.960 --> 44:21.960
Good evening. Good evening, madam.
Thank you.

44:25.960 --> 44:29.960
Hello. Hi. Do you have
a reservation for this evening?

44:29.960 --> 44:32.960
Er, yes. I'm meeting
with some people.

44:32.960 --> 44:36.640
I believe the reservation's
under the name Swanson.

44:36.640 --> 44:38.960
That's in the private dining room.

44:38.960 --> 44:41.480
Sarah will show you the way.
Thank you so much.

44:41.480 --> 44:42.960
May I take your coat?
Thank you.

44:42.960 --> 44:43.960
Right this way.

44:54.960 --> 44:56.960
Through the door at the end.
Thank you.

45:01.960 --> 45:04.960
'Why didn't he tell us
he had someone working with him?'

45:04.960 --> 45:07.960
'She knows about our deals.
If she isn't who she says she is,

45:07.960 --> 45:08.960
we're in trouble, really.'

45:10.960 --> 45:11.960
'Come in.'

45:14.160 --> 45:16.960
Nancy. Glad you could make it.
Hi.

45:16.960 --> 45:18.960
This is Graham.

45:18.960 --> 45:19.960
Pleased to meet you.

45:19.960 --> 45:22.960
Yeah. Pleased to meet you, too.

45:25.960 --> 45:27.960
We're just waiting for one more.

45:27.960 --> 45:30.960
Right.
Oh, here she is now.

45:30.960 --> 45:33.960
Sorry I'm late. I had a nightmare
getting away from work.

45:34.960 --> 45:38.640
Frances, this is Nancy. She's been
helping Blake with the investments.
