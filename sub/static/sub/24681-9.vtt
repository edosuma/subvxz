00:06.787 --> 00:09.119
<i>In New York City's
war on crime,</i>

00:09.356 --> 00:11.449
<i>the worst criminal offenders
are pursued</i>

00:11.525 --> 00:14.358
<i>by the detectives
of the Major Case Squad.</i>

00:14.428 --> 00:16.157
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:19.900 --> 00:23.836
I see. By hitting it, we
force the equation to resolve.

00:23.904 --> 00:26.896
The proof is... I just need more time.

00:27.607 --> 00:31.441
Mine is limited. Picking up
speed as it nears an absolute end.

00:31.878 --> 00:34.210
Okay, kiddies,
play date's over.

00:34.514 --> 00:35.742
Oh, nap time already?

00:35.816 --> 00:38.182
Just as I was
turning maudlin.

00:39.586 --> 00:42.020
Clumsy me.
I forgot about gravity.

00:44.591 --> 00:46.786
Joanna, just 10 minutes more.

00:48.528 --> 00:50.155
Oh, for Pete's sake.

00:53.100 --> 00:54.431
You can get that on your way out.

00:54.501 --> 00:56.196
It can wait.
But our work...

00:56.269 --> 00:57.463
Can wait, too.

01:03.577 --> 01:05.066
Early day?

01:05.144 --> 01:08.171
Remind me never to
marry a trophy wife.

01:15.789 --> 01:17.757
Joanna, I...

01:17.824 --> 01:19.815
I left my sunglasses in
the office. Could I...

01:19.893 --> 01:22.327
I'll let you know if they turn up.

01:25.232 --> 01:27.393
Sateesh. Luminosity of the sun?

01:27.467 --> 01:29.128
In joules per second?

01:29.202 --> 01:30.362
Uh-huh.

01:30.837 --> 01:32.862
Four times
10 to the 26th.

01:40.914 --> 01:42.711
Mailer-daemon, my ass.

01:43.016 --> 01:45.314
Carl! Not in
front of Emma.

01:46.219 --> 01:48.153
No time for breakfast.
Just get my...

01:48.221 --> 01:49.779
Don't go, Daddy.
Thanks.

01:49.856 --> 01:51.824
Daddy will
be back tomorrow, Emma.

01:53.593 --> 01:56.357
Ah! Our host. All set for tomorrow?

01:57.998 --> 01:59.192
Actually, John, I need...

01:59.266 --> 02:01.632
John, isn't
that your editor?

02:02.169 --> 02:04.797
John and I were just
musing about string theory.

02:04.871 --> 02:07.066
John, I
need a word with you.

02:07.274 --> 02:09.868
There is just no there, there.

02:09.943 --> 02:11.604
I think it
was the god...

02:12.813 --> 02:15.782
Does our quest for this
Theory of Everything

02:15.849 --> 02:17.544
make us guilty of hubris...

02:18.985 --> 02:20.282
...or folly?

02:21.688 --> 02:23.019
Excuse me.

02:30.197 --> 02:32.791
I don't know. Some virus.

02:32.866 --> 02:34.561
Just make up
a sickbed for me.

02:35.769 --> 02:36.929
He's nearing
Grand Central.

02:37.003 --> 02:38.595
The device is
in his knapsack.

02:38.672 --> 02:40.663
Radiating 300 MCIs gamma.

02:45.345 --> 02:48.212
You! Freeze!
Drop the bag!

02:49.916 --> 02:51.008
Don't shoot.

02:51.084 --> 02:52.449
Put the bag down!

02:55.121 --> 02:56.588
He's down. The device is on the ground.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:56.917 --> 03:59.044
Outside Grand Central
we got radiation sensors.

03:59.119 --> 04:00.780
They go hot the second
he turns that corner.

04:00.854 --> 04:02.287
We stop him,
he keels over.

04:02.355 --> 04:04.516
Riot Control's checking
his bags for a dirty bomb.

04:04.591 --> 04:06.149
Can't let EMS
in till he's done.

04:06.226 --> 04:07.284
We know who he is?

04:07.360 --> 04:09.419
No, just some dead
guy holding up traffic.

04:09.496 --> 04:10.656
Let's go.

04:11.231 --> 04:12.459
The bags are safe.
He's not.

04:13.466 --> 04:15.263
Did you check him for wounds
before you covered him up?

04:15.335 --> 04:17.495
No, but he was
coughing up blood.

04:21.274 --> 04:23.834
Here. Papers filled with formulas.

04:23.910 --> 04:25.878
Header says
Dr. Carl Neminger,

04:25.946 --> 04:28.141
Kips University Department of Physics.

04:28.582 --> 04:31.779
Maybe he's been playing with
some nasty stuff in his lab.

04:31.851 --> 04:33.546
I got one change of clothes.

04:33.620 --> 04:37.112
Brush, toothpaste and
a bottle of shampoo

04:37.190 --> 04:39.590
from the Hedgewick
Hotel around the corner.

04:42.062 --> 04:43.461
Is that his?

04:44.698 --> 04:45.756
I don't know.

04:45.832 --> 04:47.891
Maybe you
should check it out.

04:53.974 --> 04:57.501
I wonder if the Hedgewick
knows how hot their coffee is.

04:58.612 --> 05:01.103
Dr. Neminger was only
our guest for one night.

05:01.181 --> 05:04.617
He spoke at a conference this
morning in one of our small ballrooms.

05:04.684 --> 05:06.914
We got it.
It's in the bathroom.

05:06.987 --> 05:08.215
Don't move.

05:10.423 --> 05:12.948
That coffeemaker.
That's the source.

05:13.760 --> 05:17.924
It's pretty simple to spike a water
tank with radioactive materials.

05:20.700 --> 05:25.194
Mr. Fama, do you have the entry
key printout for the rooms?

05:25.639 --> 05:28.631
The last at 12:30, then
this morning at 9:00.

05:28.708 --> 05:30.369
That's when Dr. Neminger checked out.

05:30.443 --> 05:32.104
You have his bill?

05:33.346 --> 05:35.007
Just one room-service
charge.

05:35.081 --> 05:37.777
$400 last night.
He throw a party?

05:37.917 --> 05:41.375
Domestic beer and canned potato
chips, if you call that a party.

05:43.723 --> 05:46.692
It was a who's who
of quantum physics.

05:46.760 --> 05:50.719
It is inconceivable a conferee
could do something this barbaric.

05:50.964 --> 05:52.522
Anybody there
you didn't know?

05:52.599 --> 05:54.897
No, no. We can vouch for all of them.

05:54.968 --> 05:55.992
Kips is a bunch of hacks.

05:56.069 --> 05:58.629
Every one of them was jealous that
Carl had the chance to work with me.

05:58.705 --> 06:00.002
They wanted us to fail.

06:00.073 --> 06:02.064
Fail? You were working on a project?

06:02.142 --> 06:03.609
The project.

06:03.677 --> 06:06.908
Dr. Manotti chose Carl to
work with him on the TOE,

06:06.980 --> 06:09.107
the Theory
of Everything.

06:09.683 --> 06:11.844
Quantum mechanics
and general relativity

06:11.918 --> 06:14.386
describe the universe in
radically different ways.

06:14.454 --> 06:16.285
Carl and John
were searching

06:16.356 --> 06:18.085
for one equation
to unify the two.

06:19.859 --> 06:22.657
Are we keeping you
from something, Doctor?

06:23.329 --> 06:27.732
I thought if I could get back to work,
it might take my mind off of Carl's death.

06:27.801 --> 06:29.894
I'll escort them
to Carl's office

06:29.969 --> 06:32.335
and see they don't disturb anything.

06:33.373 --> 06:35.136
The level these
two were working on,

06:35.208 --> 06:37.335
only a handful
of us understand it.

06:37.410 --> 06:40.504
Now that Carl is gone,
I think I'm the only one.

06:45.185 --> 06:47.779
So, this is the
Theory of Everything?

06:48.021 --> 06:50.854
No. The real work would
be in John's office.

06:50.924 --> 06:52.551
He can no longer write or draw,

06:52.625 --> 06:55.458
so Carl's role was to
mathematically record the...

06:55.528 --> 06:57.894
He took Manotti's dictation.

06:57.964 --> 07:00.831
As best he could. John's
not easy to please.

07:01.201 --> 07:05.035
Well, he is one of the greatest
minds of the last half-century.

07:05.105 --> 07:06.402
You read his book?

07:06.473 --> 07:08.270
I tried, like
everyone else.

07:08.608 --> 07:12.772
You know, enough to think that
someone might kill to work with him,

07:12.846 --> 07:14.973
or even just to get their name on this.

07:15.048 --> 07:17.175
Now, that will bear only one name.

07:17.250 --> 07:19.775
Manotti's
Theory of Everything.

07:21.154 --> 07:22.746
What's this date?

07:22.822 --> 07:25.086
Oh, that's when John
will present the theory

07:25.158 --> 07:27.752
and proof at a conference in Berlin.

07:27.961 --> 07:32.193
It's rumored that other fellow in
England is nearing a proof as well.

07:32.932 --> 07:35.230
Two months. That's
a lot of pressure.

07:35.301 --> 07:36.461
For John, it's a race for immortality.

07:37.737 --> 07:39.227
What's Neminger's password?

07:40.073 --> 07:44.510
Carl wrote a hack-proof password
deriving from bosonic string theory.

07:45.011 --> 07:47.411
No chance it would've been
the name of the family cat.

07:47.480 --> 07:48.504
No.

07:50.984 --> 07:53.544
At the reception, how
was Neminger acting?

07:53.620 --> 07:56.748
Tense. He kept trying
to have a word with John.

08:00.827 --> 08:02.988
The night before
he died,

08:03.062 --> 08:06.361
he had something urgent
to discuss with Dr. Manotti.

08:06.432 --> 08:08.366
Did he mention that to you?

08:08.434 --> 08:11.631
No. Carl never talked
about his work with Manotti.

08:12.272 --> 08:13.762
Or complained?

08:15.041 --> 08:17.566
Carl had been under a lot of stress.

08:18.511 --> 08:21.571
The morning he left, he
yelled at our computer.

08:22.816 --> 08:25.182
I snapped at him for
cursing in front of Emma.

08:25.251 --> 08:27.116
Did he work on this?

08:27.187 --> 08:29.451
No, it's mine.
Carl never used it.

08:29.923 --> 08:32.653
But that morning he was
trying to send an e-mail.

08:32.859 --> 08:34.224
Can I look?

08:38.264 --> 08:40.255
The day before, Thursday,

08:41.333 --> 08:44.895
did anything happen that, you
know, might have upset him?

08:45.438 --> 08:46.564
No.

08:47.841 --> 08:49.832
He worked at Manotti's
home, and then Sateesh,

08:49.909 --> 08:51.900
their grad student,
drove him home.

08:51.978 --> 08:53.946
And he stayed
up and worked.

08:54.013 --> 08:55.537
I begged him
to slow down.

08:57.750 --> 09:01.151
But he was Manotti's partner, not mine.

09:01.554 --> 09:02.782
Mommy?

09:02.856 --> 09:05.256
Sorry, Emma's up again.
Excuse me.

09:08.061 --> 09:10.928
One e-mail sent Friday
morning to Manotti.

09:12.198 --> 09:14.462
Returned
undeliverable.

09:14.534 --> 09:16.593
The subject is
"Solar Flares. "

09:17.537 --> 09:19.528
Isn't that
Astronomy 101?

09:20.607 --> 09:22.370
But for some reason,

09:23.676 --> 09:28.238
sending this formula was the most
important thing in the world to Neminger.

09:28.481 --> 09:30.346
The lab said Neminger was poisoned

09:30.416 --> 09:33.408
with three vials
of samarium 153.

09:33.486 --> 09:35.784
It's an isotope
used on bone cancer.

09:35.855 --> 09:37.345
You can get it
at any hospital

09:37.423 --> 09:39.653
or university
radiology department.

09:39.726 --> 09:41.023
Any reports of
missing isotopes?

09:41.094 --> 09:42.322
No.

09:43.496 --> 09:45.088
Don't tell me they
don't track this stuff.

09:45.164 --> 09:46.256
I guess not.

09:46.332 --> 09:48.664
Somebody's not
reading the news.

09:49.502 --> 09:50.992
Where are we on
the guest list?

09:51.070 --> 09:52.560
No red flags,
unless you count

09:52.639 --> 09:54.607
wearing a pocket protector
as probable cause.

09:56.943 --> 09:57.967
Deakins.

09:58.044 --> 09:59.602
Bodies that
orbit the sun...

10:00.013 --> 10:01.071
Okay.

10:01.381 --> 10:06.114
Neminger wrote about the second
orbit being out of alignment.

10:08.688 --> 10:09.780
But the orbit of what?

10:09.856 --> 10:10.880
Okay.

10:11.357 --> 10:13.985
Manotti was found
injured at his lab.

10:15.328 --> 10:17.728
He's in intensive care
at Saint Brendan's.

10:18.564 --> 10:20.031
I'm an idiot.

10:21.401 --> 10:24.768
I was alone in the lab. I
went for a spin to the loo.

10:25.371 --> 10:26.668
Spun too much.

10:27.941 --> 10:29.909
I missed the ramp and down I went.

10:29.976 --> 10:32.638
Do you usually work
alone in your office?

10:32.879 --> 10:36.679
I tried to get him to come
home, but... We're very lucky.

10:37.450 --> 10:39.213
A few more minutes, and
he would've desatted.

10:39.285 --> 10:42.220
Desatted? You mean his
oxygen tube fell out.

10:42.689 --> 10:44.179
You were a nurse before you got married?

10:44.257 --> 10:46.623
How else would I
meet women?

10:46.693 --> 10:49.025
Anyway, as long as
clumsiness is not a crime,

10:49.095 --> 10:51.029
I'm afraid I've
wasted your time.

10:51.097 --> 10:52.826
Actually, there
is one more thing.

10:52.899 --> 10:57.029
Dr. Neminger tried to send
you an e-mail Friday morning.

10:57.270 --> 10:59.966
We were wondering if you
could decipher it for us.

11:00.039 --> 11:01.336
Oh.

11:02.041 --> 11:03.702
Got it.
Thank you.

11:08.114 --> 11:10.708
Those are some nasty
bruises you got there.

11:10.783 --> 11:12.648
And your wrist. Broken, huh?

11:13.453 --> 11:16.149
I'm a lefty.
It doesn't matter.

11:18.624 --> 11:24.256
I never got this. Solar flares.
It must be for one of his students.

11:29.268 --> 11:30.860
So he's going
down the ramp.

11:30.937 --> 11:33.735
The momentum would've
carried him forward.

11:33.906 --> 11:37.000
He'd have injuries on
the front of his face.

11:37.076 --> 11:39.704
Instead, they're all on his right side.

11:39.779 --> 11:42.942
Well, for such a genius,
he's not much of a liar.

11:51.691 --> 11:54.819
See, again.
It went forward.

11:54.894 --> 11:56.156
Now, Manotti
should have bruises

11:56.229 --> 11:58.129
on his knees and the front of his face.

11:58.197 --> 11:59.789
Where do you want it?

11:59.866 --> 12:01.424
There's good.

12:01.734 --> 12:03.031
You're not going to throw it, are you?

12:03.102 --> 12:05.536
No, he's had enough fun.

12:05.605 --> 12:06.867
See? All the dents are on the right.

12:06.939 --> 12:09.032
There's not a scratch
on the front.

12:10.843 --> 12:12.208
There's an alarm
switch back here.

12:12.278 --> 12:14.769
Is that how you found him, the alarm?

12:14.847 --> 12:16.747
I didn't
hear an alarm.

12:22.922 --> 12:24.549
You didn't hear that?

12:24.624 --> 12:27.024
No, I just found
him doing my rounds.

12:27.493 --> 12:31.224
There is no way he reached
around and turned it off himself.

12:31.431 --> 12:34.491
You know, if he was
heading down the ramp

12:35.701 --> 12:37.464
and someone
yanked him over...

12:37.537 --> 12:40.097
He would have fallen on his right side.

12:42.341 --> 12:45.333
Manotti and Neminger have an assistant?

12:45.411 --> 12:48.471
Yeah, Sateesh. He's
in Dr. Manotti's office.

12:50.483 --> 12:54.385
We got this e-mail.
We found it.

12:54.454 --> 12:56.945
Neminger tried to
send it to Manotti,

12:57.423 --> 12:58.981
but we can't
make sense of it.

12:59.058 --> 13:02.118
Well, that's because
it doesn't make any sense.

13:02.195 --> 13:05.653
Carl wrote this on
the way home in the car

13:05.731 --> 13:08.165
when we were
leaving Manotti's,

13:08.234 --> 13:11.931
but he asked about the
luminosity of the sun.

13:12.271 --> 13:14.501
That's what the joules
per second formula is.

13:14.574 --> 13:16.974
Maybe it had to do with something
that happened at Manotti's.

13:17.043 --> 13:20.535
I don't know. Before we left, he
tried to go back and see Manotti,

13:20.613 --> 13:22.740
but Antimatter stopped him.

13:23.216 --> 13:24.774
Antimatter?

13:24.851 --> 13:26.341
Mrs. Dr. Manotti.

13:26.586 --> 13:28.884
She gets in the way
of the work, you know?

13:28.955 --> 13:33.289
Last month he had the flu, and she
didn't let us see him for two weeks.

13:33.392 --> 13:35.257
And Laurie?
Who's Laurie?

13:35.328 --> 13:37.353
He dedicated
his book to her.

13:37.430 --> 13:39.091
The practice wife.

13:40.066 --> 13:43.160
Practice.
You mean his first wife?

13:43.236 --> 13:46.501
Yes, before he
became John Manotti.

13:47.006 --> 13:50.737
What you said. Carl tried to
go back in and talk to Manotti?

13:51.144 --> 13:52.509
Now, why would he do that?

13:52.578 --> 13:55.376
He got a text message
just before we left.

13:58.985 --> 14:03.012
Neminger got a text message.
We traced it back to you.

14:03.089 --> 14:04.681
It's possible.

14:04.757 --> 14:06.850
We were always checking
in on each other.

14:06.926 --> 14:08.655
Partners do that.
Don't you?

14:08.728 --> 14:10.389
Yes, we do.

14:11.731 --> 14:14.632
In fact, after we left
you at the hospital,

14:14.867 --> 14:19.133
we checked in on each other to see
if we believed your accident story.

14:19.539 --> 14:21.666
Turns out
neither of us did.

14:21.941 --> 14:25.206
You and your chair should
have damage on the front,

14:25.444 --> 14:27.537
not just on
the right side.

14:27.947 --> 14:30.108
When you've had a neurological
disease for 25 years,

14:30.183 --> 14:31.844
you get pretty
good at falling.

14:31.918 --> 14:35.445
You know, I see that you have
an alarm switch back here.

14:36.422 --> 14:38.117
Now, how does that work?

14:38.191 --> 14:42.150
When you come up off the chair,
it just goes off? Can I hear it?

14:43.029 --> 14:44.360
Is that a joke?

14:44.430 --> 14:46.830
Let me give you some help,
just a little bit. Just...

14:50.836 --> 14:53.202
Does he play the siren when he drives?

14:54.373 --> 14:55.704
She drives.
Oh.

14:56.242 --> 15:00.872
Your regular chair has the
same alarm. Nice and loud.

15:03.115 --> 15:05.345
Now, it should have
gone off when you fell.

15:05.418 --> 15:07.579
It didn't?
It's all kind of a blur.

15:07.653 --> 15:12.556
It was turned off. The person who
attacked you didn't want you to be rescued.

15:12.625 --> 15:15.753
I think I would remember
if I was attacked.

15:15.828 --> 15:17.295
That's what we thought.

15:18.497 --> 15:20.931
And now we're worried that
you're afraid to tell us.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.194
I'm not an easy
person to shut up.

15:22.268 --> 15:24.862
Lena! April! Someone!

15:26.806 --> 15:29.639
Lena, my swan, just
let them out. April...

15:38.117 --> 15:39.482
Aloe salve.

15:41.387 --> 15:44.185
It's Burow's solution. Did
Dr. Manotti have a sunburn?

15:44.257 --> 15:46.350
Heatstroke.
Just recovering.

15:46.425 --> 15:48.154
Last month he
locked himself out

15:48.227 --> 15:51.355
on the sun porch for about an
hour when everybody was out.

15:51.430 --> 15:53.864
Lots of smarts, just
not much common sense.

15:54.367 --> 15:57.359
That's atropine,
for bladder control.

15:57.837 --> 16:02.069
Atropine impairs the ability to sweat.

16:03.309 --> 16:05.004
He could have
died of heatstroke.

16:05.077 --> 16:07.011
He was lucky.
He just needed bed rest.

16:07.079 --> 16:08.944
This was on top
of having the flu?

16:09.015 --> 16:10.812
He didn't
have the flu.

16:12.818 --> 16:14.376
He lied
about the flu,

16:14.453 --> 16:17.684
and the doctors in the ER
found preexisting injuries.

16:17.757 --> 16:21.921
Bruised rib, broken finger, burns,
all within the last three months.

16:23.629 --> 16:26.427
The smartest guy on the planet
can't figure out he's being abused?

16:26.499 --> 16:27.591
We think
he tried to tell us.

16:27.667 --> 16:30.830
He accidentally knocked
over his heatstroke meds.

16:31.270 --> 16:37.505
Yeah, he might've been more,
you know, direct with Neminger.

16:37.576 --> 16:42.309
He sent him a text message at 3:11.

16:42.782 --> 16:44.579
And, see, Neminger's e
- mail starts

16:44.650 --> 16:49.610
with subject, "3:11
Solar Flare Advisory. "

16:49.789 --> 16:52.485
The advisory is Manotti's text message.

16:53.125 --> 16:59.553
Now, this formula here. Joules
per second over M times 60 squared.

17:00.633 --> 17:03.101
Now, joules per second
is the sun's luminosity.

17:03.169 --> 17:04.329
Over M...

17:05.838 --> 17:07.635
M's gotta be Manotti.

17:07.973 --> 17:10.635
Times 60 squared. Sixty seconds
times 60 minutes, an hour.

17:10.710 --> 17:14.339
Which is how long Manotti was
baking outside on the porch.

17:14.646 --> 17:19.175
"Have observed abnormal activity.
Second orbit far out of alignment.

17:19.251 --> 17:21.583
"Should I pass
on the advisory?"

17:22.387 --> 17:23.855
Second orbit.

17:23.923 --> 17:27.757
Manotti's second marriage.
The abuser is his wife.

17:29.562 --> 17:33.123
Manotti must've sent Neminger an SOS.

17:33.199 --> 17:35.064
Neminger offered to get help.

17:36.068 --> 17:37.160
He must've
written it in code,

17:37.236 --> 17:39.466
in case the wife reads Manotti's e
- mail.

17:39.538 --> 17:44.840
Neminger was killed
trying to protect Manotti,

17:44.910 --> 17:47.845
this great, frail man,

17:50.483 --> 17:52.144
from his own wife.

17:55.521 --> 17:58.718
Lena, I hope those detectives
don't scare you away.

17:58.791 --> 18:00.884
They just asked
about your heatstroke.

18:00.960 --> 18:04.020
I locked myself out. You
told them that, right?

18:04.830 --> 18:06.491
Lena, it's after 8:00.

18:06.565 --> 18:08.032
She's almost done.

18:08.100 --> 18:10.295
I'll finish.
Good night, Lena.

18:15.040 --> 18:18.305
Hargrove mentioned a White
House dinner next month.

18:18.744 --> 18:19.904
You told him
we were going?

18:19.979 --> 18:21.105
Yes, I did.

18:21.180 --> 18:25.276
Please, not so hard this time. Please.

18:33.826 --> 18:35.157
After the
initial incidents,

18:35.227 --> 18:37.752
we had our nurses
keep detailed logs.

18:37.830 --> 18:40.390
In case any of them
were accused of abuse?

18:40.466 --> 18:42.263
The accidents
only occurred

18:42.334 --> 18:44.529
when our nurses were out of the house.

18:45.304 --> 18:48.273
Or when he was alone with Ms. Manotti.

18:48.340 --> 18:49.705
I don't keep her logs.

18:49.775 --> 18:51.106
I wish I did.

18:52.645 --> 18:56.137
She was Dr. Manotti's nurse.
One of yours from your agency?

18:56.215 --> 18:58.274
The second nurse
poor Laurie hired.

18:58.350 --> 19:00.011
The first Ms. Manotti.

19:00.719 --> 19:02.084
You liked her?

19:02.154 --> 19:05.146
Well, she took care of him
all by herself for years,

19:05.224 --> 19:07.522
even when they could afford a nurse,

19:07.593 --> 19:09.527
and nothing
ever went wrong.

19:09.595 --> 19:12.792
This nurse here,
Maria Rosa Rumbidzai,

19:12.865 --> 19:15.299
she got fired in the middle
of her shift last month.

19:15.367 --> 19:16.766
Her log just stops.

19:16.836 --> 19:21.364
Maria Rosa wasn't fired. She
left without a word to anyone.

19:24.643 --> 19:29.239
I hated to leave Dr. M, but it
was a personal reason, that's why.

19:29.949 --> 19:32.884
Your log says
his rib was broken.

19:32.952 --> 19:36.319
Yes. I was changing him, and he winced.

19:36.922 --> 19:38.253
There was no
discoloration,

19:38.324 --> 19:40.315
but I knew that
something was wrong.

19:40.392 --> 19:44.226
Why didn't you call for an
x-ray? Ms. Manotti objected?

19:44.930 --> 19:47.023
I wouldn't have
cared if she did,

19:47.099 --> 19:49.693
but she was at some
garden party all day.

19:50.169 --> 19:53.400
It was Dr. Manotti
that didn't want one?

19:55.774 --> 19:57.799
Was he afraid of his wife?

20:03.115 --> 20:05.208
You care about Dr. Manotti?

20:07.052 --> 20:08.679
He made me laugh.

20:09.889 --> 20:12.983
I used to like to talk
with him about creation.

20:13.392 --> 20:17.055
He is, in his own
way, very close to God.

20:19.598 --> 20:22.795
But you left him, even
though he was being abused.

20:22.935 --> 20:24.334
If I had seen anything like that,

20:24.403 --> 20:26.598
I would have reported it
straight away.

20:26.672 --> 20:29.072
Even without seeing it,
you knew.

20:32.011 --> 20:35.378
Something happened after
you found the broken rib?

20:38.150 --> 20:40.880
Something that upset you? You
left in the middle of your shift.

20:44.290 --> 20:47.225
I went into the
bedroom at 5:00

20:47.293 --> 20:49.261
to draw the
doctor his bath.

20:52.064 --> 20:55.693
Mrs. Manotti was...
Oh, dear God in heaven.

20:58.537 --> 21:00.664
She was naked
on top of him.

21:01.640 --> 21:04.234
She screamed
at me to get out.

21:05.544 --> 21:07.273
Dr. M. Was mortified.

21:07.980 --> 21:09.948
You'd made a mistake.

21:10.015 --> 21:11.448
I couldn't face them.

21:13.218 --> 21:16.915
This bath at 5:00,
was it on a schedule?

21:17.156 --> 21:20.319
The daily schedule Mrs.
M. Leaves for the nurses.

21:22.194 --> 21:23.661
Some mistake.

21:30.402 --> 21:33.997
Hello. Joanna. Hey.

21:35.074 --> 21:36.268
Joanna?

21:38.811 --> 21:40.073
Don't go.

21:41.513 --> 21:42.605
Joanna?

21:42.681 --> 21:44.171
I was in the garden. Are you okay?

21:44.249 --> 21:45.841
Where is everyone? Where's April?
Where is everybody? Where...

21:45.918 --> 21:49.115
She's at the drugstore.
She went to the drugstore.

21:49.188 --> 21:51.156
You fell asleep.

21:53.359 --> 21:55.156
So did your computer.

22:04.436 --> 22:06.199
You've slept enough.

22:09.508 --> 22:11.942
You still have
time before Berlin.

22:14.013 --> 22:15.503
You can do it.

22:18.350 --> 22:20.648
Would you do it
for me, Johnny?

22:24.023 --> 22:25.115
Yeah?

22:33.499 --> 22:36.991
John never hurt himself
when I took care of him.

22:37.069 --> 22:39.765
Joanna must've gotten tired of waiting.

22:39.838 --> 22:42.966
Waiting for... Waiting for
nature to take its course?

22:43.308 --> 22:45.503
Oh, she didn't plan on taking
care of him for this long.

22:45.577 --> 22:48.011
You've always known
she was a gold digger?

22:49.281 --> 22:51.374
A diamond digger,
actually.

22:52.017 --> 22:54.679
She'd been working for
us for about a month

22:54.753 --> 22:57.017
and a pair of my
earrings went missing.

22:58.057 --> 23:01.584
And they were found hidden
high on the linen shelf,

23:03.028 --> 23:06.293
and Joanna denied stealing
them. John defended her,

23:06.565 --> 23:10.365
and that's how I knew that she
had started an affair with him.

23:10.436 --> 23:11.596
Why haven't you arrested her?

23:11.670 --> 23:12.762
We can't.

23:12.838 --> 23:16.296
Your father won't implicate
her. Maybe you can help us.

23:16.642 --> 23:17.939
Mom already
saved him once.

23:18.010 --> 23:19.272
Okay, Mona...

23:19.344 --> 23:21.676
After he was diagnosed,
before he was famous.

23:21.747 --> 23:23.840
My mom gave up her career, her life.

23:23.916 --> 23:28.148
"To help a great man do great things
in the little time he had left. "

23:29.988 --> 23:32.513
Your husband quotes you
in his book.

23:33.459 --> 23:35.484
I just did what was right.

23:35.561 --> 23:37.358
Marrying him
was a sacrifice.

23:37.930 --> 23:39.522
It was a choice.

23:41.433 --> 23:44.994
I came home one day and I
found he had soiled himself,

23:45.104 --> 23:48.471
and I just cleaned him
up and he started to cry,

23:50.175 --> 23:53.702
and he said, "No one else but
you would do this for me. "

23:54.513 --> 23:59.610
This brilliant, beautiful man felt
that his disease had made him repulsive.

24:00.619 --> 24:04.248
Maybe this is why he
won't implicate Joanna.

24:06.425 --> 24:09.087
Because he doesn't want
to die alone.

24:09.161 --> 24:11.425
He can't see he has other options.

24:12.297 --> 24:14.925
But it's too much
to ask, isn't it?

24:15.000 --> 24:16.865
For you to
save him again?

24:17.269 --> 24:19.863
I'd rather he save
himself this time.

24:20.372 --> 24:21.964
If he's able to.

24:22.074 --> 24:25.737
If he isn't, he'll die in
the arms of his murderer.

24:32.050 --> 24:34.780
I'm fine. I fell.
I locked myself out.

24:34.853 --> 24:36.878
I am an
absent-minded professor.

24:37.656 --> 24:41.649
We decoded Dr. Neminger's
last e-mail.

24:43.128 --> 24:44.117
He...

24:44.797 --> 24:49.234
He knew what was going on.
He died trying to help you.

24:51.203 --> 24:54.661
The rib was an accident. She
felt awful when it happened.

24:54.740 --> 24:57.436
And the other night when
you "fell" in your lab.

24:57.509 --> 24:59.306
How awful did
she feel then?

24:59.378 --> 25:01.539
Again, my fault.

25:03.448 --> 25:04.915
I was in a...

25:06.218 --> 25:09.483
A bad mood. She left,
I was chasing her...

25:09.688 --> 25:13.215
And she left you on the floor
with your oxygen tube out.

25:14.226 --> 25:15.625
Oh, Dad.

25:15.694 --> 25:19.562
John, you don't have to live like this.

25:19.631 --> 25:21.462
We'll take care of you.

25:21.533 --> 25:25.060
How can you take me back?
After all I...

25:25.137 --> 25:27.731
Dad, we just want
to be a family again.

25:38.183 --> 25:39.707
I'm so ashamed.

25:41.987 --> 25:47.118
She used our sex life
in front of the nurses.

25:48.727 --> 25:50.251
Humiliated me...

25:50.329 --> 25:52.354
You told Dr. Neminger about the abuse?

25:53.065 --> 25:56.000
No, but he noticed.

25:56.835 --> 25:59.770
And at our last session,
I sent him a message

25:59.938 --> 26:02.839
begging him not to
leave me alone with her.

26:06.144 --> 26:08.874
And the next day,
she poisoned him.

26:08.947 --> 26:11.040
And your fall, at the lab?

26:12.084 --> 26:15.645
I told her I was afraid to go
home with her after Carl's death.

26:15.721 --> 26:19.817
She smiled, then she
switched off my chair's alarm,

26:19.892 --> 26:22.588
and pushed me over
like a body at sea.

26:22.895 --> 26:24.157
Oh, sweetie.

26:25.597 --> 26:27.121
Dad, it's over.

26:30.535 --> 26:32.264
We're here for you.

26:36.041 --> 26:38.032
Maybe he's hallucinating.

26:38.577 --> 26:41.740
That happens in the latter
stages of his disease.

26:43.815 --> 26:45.806
Did he hallucinate these?

26:46.051 --> 26:52.115
Heatstroke,
broken finger, bruised rib.

26:53.592 --> 26:55.787
I would never hurt John.
I...

26:56.762 --> 26:59.253
I'm always reminding
the staff how fragile he is.

26:59.331 --> 27:01.856
Is that what you were trying
to show Nurse Rumbidzai,

27:01.934 --> 27:03.925
your husband's fragility?

27:09.374 --> 27:11.399
Are you cold, Ms. Manotti?

27:14.046 --> 27:18.847
It's just that you keep crossing
your arms, trying to stay warm.

27:20.352 --> 27:22.320
If anything,
it's too warm in here.

27:22.387 --> 27:25.083
Oh, well, I'll see what
I can do about that.

27:29.594 --> 27:32.757
If anything, you need to
turn up the heat on her.

27:33.231 --> 27:34.755
We're about to.

27:35.434 --> 27:38.961
My partner thinks he has you
pegged, but I don't see it.

27:39.137 --> 27:40.729
All that cruelty,
it doesn't make sense.

27:40.806 --> 27:41.966
Thank you.

27:42.040 --> 27:43.701
You two are
still very close.

27:43.775 --> 27:46.073
I mean, you're still sexually intimate.

27:46.144 --> 27:48.135
That's what
Nurse Rumbidzai told us.

27:48.547 --> 27:51.107
She invaded our privacy. She
had no right to tell you...

27:51.183 --> 27:53.208
You made a big
impression on her.

27:53.285 --> 27:54.877
She said you were
getting quite a ride.

27:54.953 --> 27:56.477
Detective,
let's turn the page.

27:56.555 --> 28:00.719
I was wondering, with a man
in your husband's condition,

28:00.792 --> 28:03.226
do you use any tricks
to get things started?

28:03.295 --> 28:04.592
Detective, move on!

28:04.663 --> 28:08.565
The reason I ask is because when
Nurse Rumbidzai saw you naked,

28:08.633 --> 28:10.624
straddling your husband's frail body,

28:10.702 --> 28:12.602
she said your hand was
down between... Come on...

28:12.671 --> 28:14.138
I won't get crude.
I can't believe this.

28:14.206 --> 28:16.606
I mean, you're a nurse, you
know all the sweet spots.

28:16.675 --> 28:18.006
Detective,
we're done here.

28:20.379 --> 28:23.212
Well, if you're gonna
be a prude about it.

28:26.718 --> 28:28.913
Is that what
you had in mind?

28:30.122 --> 28:32.454
What? Giving her a panic attack?

28:32.824 --> 28:36.885
Only an exhibitionist would let
a stranger observe her having sex.

28:37.596 --> 28:39.257
This woman is
no exhibitionist.

28:39.331 --> 28:43.165
Fine, we can remove one pathological
behavior from her repertoire.

28:43.235 --> 28:44.634
She's still a sadist and a murderer.

28:44.703 --> 28:46.500
That's all we need to know.

28:46.571 --> 28:49.734
Or maybe that's all Dr.
Manotti wants us to know.

28:54.813 --> 28:57.179
Her day planner says she
was picked up at 10:00

28:57.249 --> 29:00.685
and driven to Westchester
for a day-long garden party.

29:00.819 --> 29:03.185
The nurse noticed the injured rib...

29:03.255 --> 29:05.280
What was it? Like,
3:00 that afternoon.

29:06.391 --> 29:08.757
There was hardly
any discoloration.

29:08.827 --> 29:12.285
Now, if his wife had injured him

29:13.565 --> 29:15.658
before she left,
there'd be more bruising.

29:16.168 --> 29:18.193
You're suggesting
he injured himself?

29:18.270 --> 29:21.262
Well, say he did, and say he
didn't want the injury discovered

29:21.339 --> 29:25.639
until after his wife came
back, so she could be blamed.

29:26.011 --> 29:28.002
All his injuries,
all self-inflicted?

29:28.080 --> 29:30.071
We're noticing the only
person we can be sure

29:30.148 --> 29:33.447
is in the room when Manotti
gets hurt is Manotti.

29:33.518 --> 29:35.543
Then, Joanna's motive
for killing Neminger?

29:35.620 --> 29:37.417
She doesn't have one.

29:38.090 --> 29:41.890
Then if Manotti killed Neminger,
why? Just to frame his wife?

29:41.960 --> 29:43.484
The Theory of Everything.

29:45.097 --> 29:47.258
Maybe it really can explain everything.

29:51.269 --> 29:53.499
The last few months, I
couldn't get him to come to bed.

29:53.572 --> 29:55.233
He'd stay up
all night, pacing.

29:55.307 --> 29:56.501
What? Here?

29:57.275 --> 30:01.735
Or sitting at the table smoking
his pipe, just lost to the world.

30:02.314 --> 30:05.078
He was stressed, maybe because
he was doing all the work

30:05.150 --> 30:06.879
and Manotti getting all the credit.

30:06.952 --> 30:09.580
No. Just going to Berlin,

30:09.855 --> 30:11.982
being there when Dr. Manotti
presented their proof,

30:12.057 --> 30:14.855
that would've meant the world to Carl.

30:24.903 --> 30:26.063
Eames.

30:28.773 --> 30:32.470
The Berlin conference, are you
sure your husband was going?

30:32.711 --> 30:35.373
Yes. He got hotel
reservations months ago.

30:35.447 --> 30:37.312
It's on the calendar
right there.

30:38.783 --> 30:40.751
Well, why? What's
in that notebook?

30:40.819 --> 30:43.515
It looks like your
husband hit the wall.

30:47.893 --> 30:50.191
He canceled that
reservation three weeks ago.

30:50.262 --> 30:53.789
That can't be. It was everything
he was working towards.

30:54.599 --> 30:57.432
The proof, they weren't
going to crack it.

30:58.003 --> 31:01.996
And now that Carl's gone, Manotti's
the only one that knows that.

31:03.275 --> 31:05.505
I thought
we were happy, John.

31:05.610 --> 31:08.636
I gave you everything.
How could you do this?

31:08.713 --> 31:10.476
It's cruel of me, I know.

31:10.549 --> 31:13.074
Now you'll have to find your own
invitations to the White House.

31:13.151 --> 31:14.743
You've lost it, John.

31:14.819 --> 31:17.947
These insults, aren't they
a violation of her bail?

31:18.023 --> 31:20.082
Now, Joanna, if you
weren't in such a hurry

31:20.158 --> 31:22.353
to become my
celebrated widow,

31:22.427 --> 31:24.895
you wouldn't be
in this mess, no.

31:24.963 --> 31:26.487
Oh, and don't forget to take the photos.

31:26.565 --> 31:29.659
I doubt that Laurie will
want them in our house.

31:30.602 --> 31:34.094
This is very sad. I mean,
Carl is beating himself up,

31:34.172 --> 31:38.336
because he can't make the equations
work to fit Manotti's theories.

31:39.010 --> 31:41.444
Dr. Neminger was
in over his head.

31:42.047 --> 31:45.244
No, it's not Carl's work,
okay? It's the theories.

31:45.317 --> 31:47.512
Manotti's theories.
They're wrong?

31:47.586 --> 31:49.247
Yes, I mean, look,

31:49.654 --> 31:53.488
for example, this observation of
matter as it nears the event horizon.

31:53.558 --> 31:55.458
You can see for yourself,
it's completely flawed.

31:55.527 --> 31:57.518
If these flaws
were so obvious,

31:57.596 --> 32:00.224
why didn't
Dr. Neminger know that?

32:00.632 --> 32:03.192
It never would've occurred to
Carl that the theories were wrong.

32:03.268 --> 32:08.069
I mean, Carl had
a disciple's blind spot

32:08.139 --> 32:09.606
when it came to Manotti's work, okay?

32:09.674 --> 32:12.507
So, you know, he would
have blamed himself.

32:12.811 --> 32:14.608
How nice for Manotti.

32:17.382 --> 32:20.215
So Manotti has hyped
the scientific world

32:20.285 --> 32:22.549
for years about his
Theory of Everything,

32:22.621 --> 32:25.249
and now he couldn't deliver the goods.

32:25.323 --> 32:26.312
His failure
would be profound.

32:26.391 --> 32:28.222
And public.

32:28.627 --> 32:30.959
Now, his whole life, even his marriage,

32:31.029 --> 32:33.293
is predicated on his status as a genius.

32:33.365 --> 32:35.925
He might be worried
he'd lose everything,

32:36.001 --> 32:37.593
especially
his trophy wife.

32:38.069 --> 32:41.061
So he killed Neminger
to cover up his failure.

32:41.239 --> 32:46.142
And to give him a face-saving
way out of the Berlin conference.

32:47.012 --> 32:50.106
Your Theory of Everything
has a lot of moving parts.

32:50.181 --> 32:54.447
Not for someone who thinks that the
universe is composed of 11 dimensions.

32:54.519 --> 32:58.148
The parts being moved by a man
practically incapable of movement.

32:58.223 --> 33:00.191
How did he engineer
the murder,

33:00.258 --> 33:02.123
or even throw himself down the stairs

33:02.193 --> 33:05.094
without setting off
the alarm on the chair?

33:05.730 --> 33:08.927
Well, maybe the same way
his first wife's earrings

33:09.000 --> 33:11.696
ended up on the top
shelf of the linen closet.

33:11.770 --> 33:14.830
He's not as immobile as
he'd like everyone to think.

33:14.906 --> 33:18.535
We need to find out if they're
done fixing his wheelchair.

33:18.610 --> 33:22.603
I have to get back to the university,
okay? Do you still need me?

33:23.148 --> 33:26.447
Yes. You're about to prove
the Theory of Everything.

33:30.622 --> 33:33.022
There were a few
last-minute adjustments,

33:33.091 --> 33:34.991
but they finally delivered
the chair this morning

33:35.060 --> 33:36.755
and now I can
get back to work.

33:36.828 --> 33:38.455
Then we'll
make this quick.

33:38.530 --> 33:41.931
We found a notebook
at Dr. Neminger's home.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.627
We're wondering if
you've ever seen it.

33:45.036 --> 33:48.164
Never.
What's in it?

33:48.773 --> 33:49.967
Proofs.

33:51.242 --> 33:54.211
It seems that Dr. Neminger
and Sateesh

33:56.047 --> 33:57.810
were working on your
Theory of Everything.

33:57.882 --> 34:02.114
Sateesh told us they'd
resolved most of the equations.

34:02.354 --> 34:05.414
Resolved them? Oh, really?

34:05.990 --> 34:08.857
Well, apparently he found
flaws in your theories,

34:08.927 --> 34:12.260
and he was working on
solutions uniquely his own.

34:13.764 --> 34:18.702
He was going to present them
in Berlin under his own name.

34:20.672 --> 34:23.766
His solutions were probably
a rehash of my work.

34:23.875 --> 34:26.105
I could tell right away,
if I could just...

34:26.177 --> 34:27.337
I'm sorry.

34:29.547 --> 34:33.574
The DA said that there
were proprietary issues.

34:33.650 --> 34:35.380
I can't see the harm
in just letting me...

34:37.489 --> 34:39.616
That's probably your wife.

34:39.690 --> 34:41.556
Hey, I bet they need
help with their luggage.

34:41.626 --> 34:42.786
I'm sure of it.

34:42.860 --> 34:44.886
Could you hang
onto that? Thanks.

34:46.464 --> 34:48.364
I really want to make a good impression.

34:48.433 --> 34:52.335
I should've put some cologne
on with all my exertions...

34:53.237 --> 34:55.206
Well, I could
get it for you.

34:55.273 --> 34:57.241
Would you?
Where is it?

34:57.609 --> 35:00.874
In a bottle in the bathroom
at the end of the hall.

35:06.651 --> 35:10.052
So the terms of her bail are
that she can't have any contact.

35:10.121 --> 35:13.784
Now, if she does, call us.

35:15.894 --> 35:18.089
He wanted to make
a good impression.

35:18.163 --> 35:19.460
Oh.

35:23.568 --> 35:25.035
Dad.

35:25.103 --> 35:26.798
My guardian angels
have returned.

35:28.406 --> 35:29.896
You look well.

35:31.109 --> 35:32.701
You've been working?

35:32.777 --> 35:35.837
Just knowing you were
coming back, I unblocked.

35:36.214 --> 35:39.240
Or maybe knowing that
Carl solved your proofs

35:39.851 --> 35:41.648
lit a fire under you.

35:42.587 --> 35:44.248
Hardly.

35:44.322 --> 35:48.520
I'm sure Carl and Sateesh just
regurgitated my lesser-known work.

35:49.894 --> 35:51.987
Our experts
don't think so.

35:52.330 --> 35:54.560
Three months ago,
I dictated my theory

35:54.632 --> 35:56.759
of quantum
entanglements to Carl.

35:59.471 --> 36:02.304
I bet there's some
version of it in there.

36:03.475 --> 36:07.104
Well, it'd be really
something if it's in here.

36:09.914 --> 36:11.814
Didn't we have a question
for Ms. Manotti?

36:11.883 --> 36:13.180
Right.

36:13.918 --> 36:17.183
The earrings Joanna stole,
where did you keep them?

36:17.889 --> 36:20.881
The earrings.

36:20.959 --> 36:22.756
In a drawer,
in a small jewelry box.

36:22.827 --> 36:25.091
Did Joanna ever see you put them there?

36:25.163 --> 36:27.324
My wife sometimes
kept her earrings

36:27.398 --> 36:30.128
in a crystal dish
on top of the dresser.

36:30.335 --> 36:34.669
I think I found it. Is this it?
The Theory of Quantum Entanglements?

36:35.206 --> 36:36.230
No.

36:36.908 --> 36:40.366
That's my observation on matter
as it nears the event horizon.

36:40.445 --> 36:43.209
The one our experts
said was flawed.

36:43.414 --> 36:45.382
Your experts don't know
what they're talking about.

36:45.450 --> 36:48.112
Actually, it might explain

36:48.853 --> 36:54.052
why Carl wrote these
exhortations in the margin.

36:55.527 --> 36:58.155
The two of you couldn't
prove your theory?

36:58.229 --> 37:03.098
Nonsense. We were making great
strides. The end was in sight.

37:03.434 --> 37:05.629
Do you think you'll
finish in time for Berlin?

37:05.703 --> 37:07.136
I hope to.

37:08.206 --> 37:09.503
I've had
trouble concentrating.

37:09.574 --> 37:12.099
Such terrible things
have happened.

37:12.176 --> 37:14.474
But that's all over now, Dad.

37:14.779 --> 37:17.942
Since the end was in sight, Dr. Manotti,

37:18.016 --> 37:21.179
what's your theory
on why Carl canceled

37:21.252 --> 37:23.482
his hotel in Berlin three weeks ago?

37:24.422 --> 37:25.548
He did?

37:25.623 --> 37:27.113
Without even
telling his wife.

37:27.959 --> 37:29.859
Well, we have a theory.

37:30.595 --> 37:34.725
It's based
on our observation

37:34.799 --> 37:38.064
of the acceleration
of panic

37:39.737 --> 37:42.467
as it nears the
catastrophic event,

37:43.741 --> 37:48.804
fueled by a great man facing
his fear of losing everything.

37:49.681 --> 37:52.343
Everything he's achieved.
His status.

37:52.917 --> 37:54.384
His trophy wife.

37:54.452 --> 37:56.420
You can stop right there.

37:56.487 --> 38:01.857
You needed a no-fault
explanation for your failure.

38:06.164 --> 38:09.099
What better than the
death of a colleague?

38:09.167 --> 38:10.498
What are you
accusing him of?

38:10.568 --> 38:14.561
He framed Joanna for murder,
after framing her for his abuse.

38:16.107 --> 38:18.075
That is a monstrous
allegation.

38:18.142 --> 38:21.043
For God's sake,
just look at him.

38:21.112 --> 38:24.411
Yeah, just look at me,
stuck in this pitiful body.

38:25.583 --> 38:26.675
Pity.

38:27.552 --> 38:30.715
You counted on pity
as an excuse for failure.

38:32.423 --> 38:35.790
You traded on it to
win back your family,

38:38.296 --> 38:42.062
a safety net,
the unconditional love

38:42.133 --> 38:47.161
of a woman who'd seen you
through your darkest hours.

38:47.672 --> 38:49.970
Stop it. My father's not like that.

38:50.041 --> 38:53.875
You can't manipulate the
universe to fit your theories.

38:55.179 --> 38:59.775
You can't even manipulate
your own body. So what's left,

39:02.186 --> 39:04.177
manipulation of
everybody around you.

39:04.255 --> 39:06.519
They came back
because they loved me.

39:06.591 --> 39:09.185
Well,
it's just a theory.

39:09.994 --> 39:11.962
It's our own
untested theory.

39:12.030 --> 39:13.930
We haven't even proven it
to the DA yet.

39:13.998 --> 39:15.898
He wanted to know
how you could have

39:15.967 --> 39:18.162
possibly staged that
fall down the stairs

39:18.236 --> 39:19.726
without setting off
your alarm.

39:19.804 --> 39:21.271
Simple. I couldn't.

39:21.339 --> 39:25.207
No, see, we told him
you did it the same way

39:25.276 --> 39:28.473
you hid your
wife's earrings.

39:29.847 --> 39:31.542
It's all right, Laurie.
Just show them out.

39:31.616 --> 39:33.914
Look.
I think I found it.

39:33.985 --> 39:37.250
It's the Theory of
Quantum Entanglements.

39:37.321 --> 39:39.118
It's right here. You were right.

39:40.792 --> 39:41.884
You win the bet.

39:41.959 --> 39:44.951
You can leave a buck on
the desk as you leave.

39:50.101 --> 39:54.231
You said that you gave Carl
the theory three months ago.

39:56.107 --> 40:01.875
Funny thing is, we asked Sateesh
to write up this paper yesterday.

40:03.347 --> 40:06.874
So what's your theory about
how you knew it was in here?

40:07.952 --> 40:09.146
Lucky guess.

40:09.220 --> 40:13.919
No. You looked, when my
partner was out of the room.

40:14.192 --> 40:16.092
Don't you ever give
your partner any credit?

40:16.160 --> 40:19.288
You know that she placed
that notebook out of my reach.

40:19.363 --> 40:20.728
Unless you switched off the alarm,

40:20.798 --> 40:23.164
lifted yourself up out
of the chair.

40:23.234 --> 40:26.965
Detective, I can't even reach the
switch, let alone lift myself up.

40:27.038 --> 40:28.471
So you're saying that
the alarm is still on?

40:28.539 --> 40:30.063
Yes, it's still on. Look for yourself.

40:30.141 --> 40:33.076
The switch is in
the "on" position.

40:35.880 --> 40:38.041
So it is.

40:38.116 --> 40:41.051
It might interest you to
know that the adjustment

40:41.119 --> 40:43.519
that the wheelchair
company made,

40:44.756 --> 40:46.621
it was at our request.

40:47.125 --> 40:51.323
See, once you turn the switch
off, you can't turn it back on.

40:53.397 --> 40:55.524
Why don't you
give it a try?

40:56.701 --> 40:59.670
Lift yourself up.
See what happens.

41:00.004 --> 41:01.494
Need some help, Doc?

41:01.572 --> 41:03.233
Stay away from me.

41:05.276 --> 41:08.370
Well, maybe your wife
should give you some help.

41:08.813 --> 41:12.476
This is insane. How dare you?

41:13.184 --> 41:15.448
Why don't you just do
what they're asking you to?

41:15.520 --> 41:18.216
I don't need to prove anything to them.

41:18.322 --> 41:21.883
John, I'm asking you. I'm asking you.

41:22.393 --> 41:23.417
Let me help you.

41:23.494 --> 41:24.552
You can't be serious.

41:24.629 --> 41:26.824
John, if you don't get up now...

41:26.898 --> 41:30.664
Keep your hands off me.

41:40.278 --> 41:41.870
It's true, then.

41:43.447 --> 41:45.540
Everything
they are saying.

41:46.951 --> 41:49.385
Laurie, please
don't believe them.

41:50.188 --> 41:53.715
John, how could you?
How could you do it?

41:53.791 --> 41:54.917
Laurie, Laurie,
please don't...

41:54.992 --> 41:58.155
You feel it all slipping
away, don't you, Doctor?

42:00.398 --> 42:03.094
Your mental faculties,
your family...

42:03.167 --> 42:04.395
Shut up.

42:04.468 --> 42:07.562
...your great insights,
the quantum leaps,

42:07.638 --> 42:09.401
they just came to
a stop, didn't they?

42:09.640 --> 42:10.664
No.

42:10.875 --> 42:12.809
Did you think
about Einstein,

42:12.877 --> 42:15.038
spending the last
30 years of his life

42:16.447 --> 42:21.316
hoping for, you know,
one more breakthrough?

42:22.353 --> 42:23.718
Never came.

42:23.788 --> 42:26.120
Einstein was a flash
in the pan.

42:31.229 --> 42:33.561
Mona, sweetheart,

42:35.666 --> 42:37.031
I know you.

42:38.936 --> 42:41.166
Daddy, please,
just show them.

42:41.439 --> 42:44.306
Sweetheart, I can't.

42:45.977 --> 42:47.205
I can't.

42:48.312 --> 42:50.542
I got rid of Joanna.
I did it all for us.

42:50.615 --> 42:52.446
That's how much I love you.

42:57.521 --> 43:01.252
Mona, I need you, I need your
mother. Don't go, don't leave.

43:02.426 --> 43:05.190
John Manotti, you're
under arrest for murder.

43:06.497 --> 43:10.524
No! No! No!

43:13.537 --> 43:16.904
My mother always said, "Be
happy you're not a genius.

43:17.041 --> 43:19.236
"It makes for
a lonely life. "
