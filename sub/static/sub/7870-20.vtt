-(whistle blows)

00:27.527 --> 00:31.906

00:44.377 --> 00:48.298
HOMER: Now that's what I call
going for a spin!

00:49.132 --> 00:50.884
(grunts)

00:50.967 --> 00:54.054
Now that's what I call
a snappy retort!

00:54.137 --> 00:56.598
Stop saying
what you call things!

00:56.681 --> 00:58.308
I'm trying
to watch the movie!

00:58.391 --> 01:00.643
Welcome to annual conclave of

01:00.727 --> 01:02.645
International Brotherhood
of Evil.

01:02.729 --> 01:06.024
This year's theme:
"Evil in the Age of Social Media."

01:06.107 --> 01:08.109
We have prepared
three breakout rooms

01:08.193 --> 01:09.819
for small group discussion.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.112
CROWD:
Hear, hear!

01:11.196 --> 01:14.074
These small rooms
are an excellent way

01:14.157 --> 01:16.659
for villains to mingle
with super-villains.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.620
But are you sure
we will not be bothered

01:18.703 --> 01:20.955
by the American master-spy

01:21.039 --> 01:23.416
-Stradivarius Cain?
-(gasps and murmuring)

01:23.500 --> 01:25.376
Do not worry about Dr. Cain.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.962
The last I saw him,
my beautiful mistress

01:28.046 --> 01:29.881
was about to finish him off.

01:29.964 --> 01:32.717
Yes, that's what I did.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.761
You killed him, right?

01:34.844 --> 01:37.472
Yes, he was
the perfect lover...

01:37.555 --> 01:39.015
of being killed!

01:39.099 --> 01:41.392
It's a weird sentence,
but let's move on.

01:41.476 --> 01:45.105
My baker has prepared an edible
monument to Cain's demise.

01:45.188 --> 01:46.940
(crowd chatters)

01:47.023 --> 01:49.025
Party's over, General.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.527
Stradivarius Cain?!

01:50.610 --> 01:52.529
No...!

01:52.612 --> 01:56.741
He turned that Russian guy
into Swiss cheese!

01:56.825 --> 01:57.951
Homer!

01:58.034 --> 02:01.037
People are here to see the movie,
not listen to you!

02:01.121 --> 02:03.164
Hey, Homer,
great yell-outs tonight!

02:03.248 --> 02:05.625
Lucky you, Marge!
You get to hear 'em the loudest!

02:05.708 --> 02:07.585
You've ruined me
for other men!

02:07.669 --> 02:09.420
That's my hobby.

02:09.504 --> 02:12.423
This is my job.

02:12.507 --> 02:15.802
Looks like that guy's got
turret's syndrome!

02:15.885 --> 02:17.512
(both laugh)

02:17.595 --> 02:20.682
I couldn't have thought of that
in 10,000 lifetimes!

02:21.850 --> 02:23.434
(groans)

02:23.518 --> 02:25.979
(Homer chuckles)

02:27.522 --> 02:31.734
(chuckling continues)

02:35.738 --> 02:37.907
Swiss cheese...

02:37.991 --> 02:40.243
Marge, how come you're
not saying anything?

02:40.326 --> 02:42.704
There was enough talking
during the movie.

02:42.787 --> 02:44.998
This date night was even worse
than the date night

02:45.081 --> 02:47.292
we saw <i>Date Night.</i>

02:58.136 --> 02:59.888

02:59.971 --> 03:02.140

03:14.944 --> 03:16.738
embarrassing YouTube videos
of our teachers,

03:16.821 --> 03:20.033
we will be scanning you

03:23.328 --> 03:24.954
KID:

03:27.874 --> 03:29.542
A new low.
(sighs)

03:29.626 --> 03:32.503
I should've taken that
superintendent job in Honduras.

03:32.587 --> 03:35.298
My own donkey, all the sugarcane
I could suck...

03:35.381 --> 03:38.801
if only I could stomach
the upside-down question marks.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.472
Hmm... Hmm?!

03:43.473 --> 03:44.307

Hey Simpson.
Let me save you the trouble

back in your pocket.

03:52.857 --> 03:55.526
Stupid Nelson!
I hate that guy.

03:55.610 --> 03:59.197
My mom says bullies only bully
'cause they're scared.

04:11.042 --> 04:13.294

-Boy, Homer, I gotta say,

04:13.378 --> 04:15.213
Marge looked pretty easy
on the eyes last night.

04:15.296 --> 04:17.382
And I know eye-ease!

04:17.465 --> 04:18.633
-Yeah.
-Uh-oh.

04:18.716 --> 04:19.968
Trouble in paradise?

04:20.051 --> 04:22.220
No, just my marriage.

04:22.303 --> 04:23.680
BOTH: Ooh.

04:23.763 --> 04:24.806
(whines)

04:26.140 --> 04:28.184
Honey, it's me again.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.020
I can't work knowing
that you're mad at me.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.689
I just wanna hear
your voice.

04:32.772 --> 04:35.650
And I'm counting the minutes
till the whistle blows,

04:35.733 --> 04:38.528
then I go to Moe's,
then I rush home to you.

04:38.611 --> 04:40.280
-(tires screech)
-Ooh!

04:40.363 --> 04:42.407
Explain this infernal
wheel to me again.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.701
Left for left,
right for right!

04:44.784 --> 04:46.160

04:55.044 --> 04:56.921
Excellent.
He's alive.

04:57.005 --> 05:00.049
Smithers, give this man
one Ibuprofen,

05:00.133 --> 05:02.552
uncoated, and send him back
to his workstation.

05:02.635 --> 05:05.513
Sir, Simpson has sustained
a serious concussion.

05:05.596 --> 05:08.975
Recent research says you must
give him time off to recover.

05:09.058 --> 05:10.351
Oh, pish.

05:10.435 --> 05:12.603
When I was in Africa, I had my
skull cracked open

05:12.687 --> 05:14.188
by cannibals,
and I'm still kicking!

05:14.272 --> 05:16.149
Sir, that was your partner.

05:16.232 --> 05:17.525
You betrayed him
to the cannibals.

05:17.608 --> 05:19.110
(chuckling)
Oh, that's right.

05:19.193 --> 05:21.863
I have his memories
because I ate his brain.

05:21.946 --> 05:23.531
Mr. Burns, you have
to give this man something.

05:23.614 --> 05:26.409
He could sue us
for all we've got!

05:26.492 --> 05:29.996
Fine. Eight weeks off
with pay.

05:30.079 --> 05:32.332
-(shrieks)
-That's a good thing.

05:32.415 --> 05:34.542
But you said it so mean.

05:36.377 --> 05:37.462
(chuckles)

05:37.545 --> 05:38.755
Eight weeks paid vacation,

05:38.838 --> 05:41.591
and all because
of a little bump on the noggin.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.801

-(grunts)

05:44.802 --> 05:48.306
Hey, Marge, here's something
that'll make you happy!

05:48.389 --> 05:51.017
-Not in the mood!
-No, this is really good. I...

05:51.100 --> 05:53.019
Nelson took
my lunch money again.

05:53.102 --> 05:54.520
-Now, listen, Lisa...
-(saxophone playing)

05:54.604 --> 05:57.065
Hold that thought.
I'm tuning my saxophone.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.486
-Sharp. Flat.
-No one will tell me if

06:01.569 --> 06:04.989
-I'm a ghost or not!
-Well, I just got...

06:11.079 --> 06:13.206
(heart beating)

06:13.289 --> 06:14.999
Got what, Homer?

06:15.083 --> 06:16.793
Uh... I got...

06:16.876 --> 06:20.171
Shelbyville radio
in my car for a few minutes.

06:20.254 --> 06:22.757
(groans) Homer,
I'm a single mother

06:22.840 --> 06:24.175
trying to raise a family here.

06:24.258 --> 06:26.219
-But you're not...
-Just zip it!

06:26.302 --> 06:30.848
(all complaining)

06:30.932 --> 06:33.810
I have eight weeks
paid vacation,

06:33.893 --> 06:35.186
and my family doesn't know.

06:35.269 --> 06:37.105
Whoo-hoo.

06:40.691 --> 06:43.653
Honey, I'm off to work!

06:44.779 --> 06:46.739
You know...
maybe I should call in sick.

06:46.823 --> 06:49.492
We could visit all
our old romantic haunts

06:49.575 --> 06:52.703
that have closed and turned into
temporary Halloween stores.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.997
I have to take Maggie
for her checkup.

06:55.081 --> 06:58.042
And a guy's coming to see what
the smell is under the house.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.503
I get it.
You need your Marge time.

07:00.586 --> 07:04.298

07:16.561 --> 07:18.438
I didn't get
much sleep last night,

07:18.521 --> 07:21.899
because I was up late again,
lamenting the choices I've made.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.986
Haw-haw!
You can't change the past.

07:25.069 --> 07:27.530
Just for that, you can go
to the principal's office,

07:27.613 --> 07:30.408
while the rest of the class
enjoys... a movie day.

07:55.641 --> 07:58.394
Do you want lies with that?

08:03.441 --> 08:07.111

making me look like a scuzzbag.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.529

08:08.613 --> 08:11.240

in Africa doesn't exist?

It's bad.
You can just scrape it right off.

08:25.171 --> 08:29.842
But still I soldier on
with my "Laffy Meal."

this is all above-board.

08:41.771 --> 08:45.399
One month
of eating Krusty Burger

08:45.483 --> 08:48.569
and nothing else
has transformed me

08:48.653 --> 08:52.698
into a morbidly obese,
toilet-busting American.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.784
If I don't have
some kind of nugget

08:54.867 --> 08:57.411
every five minutes, I'll die.

08:59.163 --> 09:01.040
I'm so weak...

I can go to Moe's without having

10:07.106 --> 10:08.232
(beer pouring)

10:08.316 --> 10:10.026
Hey, Homer.
I could hear your

through the door.

your problems,

11:00.451 --> 11:03.412
Now I'm about to undertake
my toughest mission ever:

11:03.496 --> 11:06.666
to make you into a man
your wife can't resist.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.171
What the...?
No one can see you!

11:12.254 --> 11:15.299
Other people's imaginary
friends can see me.

11:15.383 --> 11:16.759
(groans)

11:16.842 --> 11:19.929
Hello, Dr. Cain.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.597
Hello, Hufnpuffalus.

11:21.681 --> 11:25.476
Sorry I slept
with your girlfriend.

11:25.559 --> 11:27.353
You did me a favor, man.

11:27.436 --> 11:29.021
(Nelson humming)

11:29.105 --> 11:32.108
Lunch money, lunch money,
lunch money.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.359
Hey, Lis.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.194
Nelson, don't you want
my lunch money?

11:35.277 --> 11:38.364
Nah. Chicks wind up
getting all your money anyway.

11:38.447 --> 11:40.574
That's sexist,
but thank you.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.077
Now I gotta go liberate some
cash from your brother.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.537
Well, if you must.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.123
See if you can find out
where my dolls are.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.708
You might not like
the answer.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.167
I just want closure.

11:51.627 --> 11:53.754
Simpson, you know
why I'm here.

11:53.838 --> 11:57.341
Nelson, I could give you
my lunch money...

11:57.425 --> 11:59.677
or I could give you...

11:59.760 --> 12:01.429
Lunch?

12:01.512 --> 12:03.013
Actual lunch?!

12:03.097 --> 12:05.015
Look at all them burgers
and fries.

12:05.099 --> 12:07.476
I didn't know they served
these things warm!

12:07.560 --> 12:10.604
Aw... they feel
like a baby's head.

12:10.688 --> 12:13.774
I just thank God you didn't take
my coupons.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.609
Got enough for a month.

12:15.693 --> 12:18.487
Free hamburger?!
Mmm-mmm-mmm!

12:18.571 --> 12:20.197
No, you give them
the coupon,

12:20.281 --> 12:21.657
and they give you
the hamburger.

12:21.741 --> 12:22.825
I knew that.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.618
(chuckles)

12:30.708 --> 12:33.002
I must say,
whoever installed

12:33.085 --> 12:37.047
your car's secret weapons
did a great job hiding them.

12:37.131 --> 12:40.384
Yeah, Dr. Cain,
the thing about that is...

12:40.468 --> 12:42.803
uh, there aren't any weapons.

12:42.887 --> 12:46.640
What?! Well, does your car
at least turn into something else?

12:46.724 --> 12:49.894
Sometimes Marge says
I turn it into a trashcan.

12:49.977 --> 12:52.229
Hmm... (groans).

12:52.313 --> 12:53.981
Homer, you are going
to clean up this car,

12:54.064 --> 12:57.234
put on cologne, and become
a sparkling conversationalist.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.236
Sounds like you're turning
into wife number two.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.405
I can do that.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.491
So, stick with Marge!

13:03.574 --> 13:04.742
(Homer gasping)

13:04.825 --> 13:07.328
Whoa, what's going on
there, Lou?

13:07.411 --> 13:09.246
Well, if you ask me,
Chief...

13:09.330 --> 13:10.414
(low groan)

13:10.498 --> 13:11.999
All right,
what does this mean?

13:13.250 --> 13:15.503
Childhood obesity...

13:15.586 --> 13:17.087
(chuckles)
it's not funny anymore!

13:17.171 --> 13:20.633
Breakfast cereals where
the surprise inside is diabetes

13:20.716 --> 13:22.760
and soda cups the size
of hot tubs

13:22.843 --> 13:26.263
have made every state
Mississippi-fat.

13:26.347 --> 13:27.932
Mmm-mmm!

13:28.015 --> 13:30.309
(gasps)
That's Nelson!

13:30.392 --> 13:33.354
No, you're imagining
things.

13:33.437 --> 13:35.064
What else you got?

13:35.147 --> 13:36.941
Just bubbling oil.

13:37.024 --> 13:39.276
Stand back
and give me a straw.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.695
(gasps)

13:41.779 --> 13:44.198
Now, the ultimate test:

13:44.281 --> 13:47.910
I want you to convince...
that woman

13:47.993 --> 13:51.121
to give herself to you
body and soul.

13:51.205 --> 13:53.207
But I'm a married man.

13:53.290 --> 13:55.626
Yeah, I know.
A married man is never attracted

13:55.709 --> 13:57.711
to a beautiful woman
he doesn't even know,

13:57.795 --> 14:01.298
but this will give you the confidence
you need with Marge.

14:01.382 --> 14:04.969
Okay, I'll make
a stranger love me forever.

14:05.052 --> 14:07.096
And Homer, remember:

14:07.179 --> 14:08.681
it doesn't matter
what you say

14:08.764 --> 14:11.767
as long as you say it
with confidence.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.352
Mm-hmm!

14:13.435 --> 14:16.438
My dear, did you just
fall from heaven?

14:16.522 --> 14:19.441
'Cause your hair looks
really messed up.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.110
Okay, it matters
a little what you say.

14:21.193 --> 14:22.444
Moving on...

14:22.528 --> 14:24.154
You know what wood
makes the best

14:24.238 --> 14:26.699
ventriloquist dummy?
Maple.

14:28.868 --> 14:32.371
How many hardboiled eggs
do you think I can eat?

14:32.454 --> 14:36.125
(groans)
Look, just say this:

14:36.208 --> 14:38.127
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm!

14:38.210 --> 14:39.962
When I was in special ops,

14:40.045 --> 14:41.672
they held me
in an Afghan prison

14:41.755 --> 14:44.967
where all I could see
was a patch of blue sky.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.969
But that blue
was nothing compared

14:47.052 --> 14:50.055
to the blue of your eyes.

14:50.139 --> 14:54.101
Oh... I am a sucker
for articulate fatsos.

14:55.686 --> 14:56.812
(giggles)

14:56.896 --> 14:58.063
MAN:
What is this?

14:58.147 --> 15:00.691
I leave for two seconds
to get chocolate martinis,

15:00.774 --> 15:04.278
and my wife is expertly seduced
by this pork empanada!

15:04.361 --> 15:05.946
(gasps)
What do I do?

15:06.030 --> 15:08.073
Squirt that lemon
in his eye!

15:08.157 --> 15:10.451
You think a lemon
will stop me?!

15:12.620 --> 15:14.538
A lime! No...!

15:14.622 --> 15:16.457
(laughing)

15:17.833 --> 15:19.793
Did you see the guy?

15:21.837 --> 15:23.130
(humming)

15:23.213 --> 15:25.257
Marge, what brings you
to the S.N.P.P.?

15:25.341 --> 15:27.301
Homie's been working
so hard.

15:27.384 --> 15:29.386
I thought I'd bring him
a special lunch.

15:29.470 --> 15:30.846
Marge, you're a blue angel.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.848
And I'm not talking about
those pilots that hot dog in

15:32.932 --> 15:34.892
an air show while the real men
are in combat.

15:34.975 --> 15:37.603
But I gotta ask:
where's Homer working?

15:37.686 --> 15:39.229
Here, right?

15:39.313 --> 15:41.273
Not since Burns gave him
that time off.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.150
-What is this? Week six?
-What?!

15:43.233 --> 15:46.320
I knew there was a reason
he was leaving on time!

15:46.403 --> 15:49.323
Oh, I can't believe this!

15:50.324 --> 15:51.492
(tires squeal)

15:51.575 --> 15:53.160
What'd you say to her?

15:53.243 --> 15:55.496
I don't know. I thought I was
making small talk.

15:55.579 --> 15:58.749
But it turned out
to be big talk.

16:01.835 --> 16:06.006
(Krusty, chimpanzee
grunting loudly)

16:08.342 --> 16:09.593
-What?!
-Krusty!

16:09.677 --> 16:11.470
This once-vibrant
young bully

16:11.553 --> 16:13.889
won't even live to pick on
kids in junior high!

16:13.973 --> 16:16.350
Because he's been eating
nothing but your food!

16:16.433 --> 16:17.935
Atta boy!

16:18.018 --> 16:19.436
(coughs)

16:19.520 --> 16:21.855
Got any fries, man?
I just need a couple.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.816
Not my responsibility.

16:23.899 --> 16:25.734
He didn't have
to order that crap.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.404
We've got yogurt
and salad on the menu!

16:28.487 --> 16:30.823
Do you actually serve
those items?

16:30.906 --> 16:33.033
No. Mmm...

16:34.868 --> 16:36.954
All right, kid,
to make this right,

16:37.037 --> 16:39.790
I'm gonna hook you up
with my personal trainer.

16:39.873 --> 16:43.335
Billy, get this kid
into superhero shape!

16:43.419 --> 16:45.504
Hugh Jackman Wolverine?

16:45.587 --> 16:46.797
I'm not made of money.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.258
Alicia Silverstone Batgirl?

16:49.341 --> 16:51.510
He's that now.

16:51.593 --> 16:53.262
(tires screech)

16:54.346 --> 16:57.307
(humming)

16:57.391 --> 16:59.852
-(gasps)
-Busy day at work?

16:59.935 --> 17:03.272
Did you get a lot
of work done, worker man?

17:03.355 --> 17:05.024
What do I do?
What do I do?!

17:05.107 --> 17:07.067
Take her by those shoulders
she never covers

17:07.151 --> 17:08.986
and tell her the truth.

17:09.069 --> 17:11.196
You're right, Marge,
I lied.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.657
Don't give me
that load of... Huh?

17:13.741 --> 17:15.159
I got a head injury
at work,

17:15.242 --> 17:16.910
and they gave me eight
weeks paid vacation.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.830
Head injury?!
Why didn't you tell me?

17:19.913 --> 17:21.999
And I spent all
that time learning

17:22.082 --> 17:24.126
how to be a better husband.

17:24.209 --> 17:25.836
The kind of husband you deserve.

17:25.919 --> 17:28.338
Wha...?

17:28.422 --> 17:30.591
Kiss her.
Kiss her while I watch.

17:30.674 --> 17:32.134
(gasps)

17:32.217 --> 17:34.303
(both moaning)

17:36.221 --> 17:37.681
Mmm...

17:37.765 --> 17:39.183
HOMER:
The three of us are going

17:39.266 --> 17:42.352
to the most romantic restaurant
in town.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.731
This car's so clean!

17:45.814 --> 17:48.067
I'm not getting flea bites
on my ankles!

17:48.150 --> 17:51.779
I have bug-bombed
the car for m'lady.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.113
(giggles)

17:54.573 --> 17:56.450
MARGE:
Whoo! Whoo!

17:57.868 --> 17:59.787
-(grunts)
-(gasps)

17:59.870 --> 18:01.872
(groans)

18:01.955 --> 18:04.541
We meet again!

18:04.625 --> 18:06.293
Looking for this?

18:14.218 --> 18:17.304
He won't be out for long.
Flee, my love!

18:17.387 --> 18:18.722
(panting)

18:18.806 --> 18:20.224
Why is he trying
to kill you,

18:20.307 --> 18:22.392
and why did she call
you her love?

18:22.476 --> 18:23.852
It was all
a training exercise

18:23.936 --> 18:25.229
to make me smooth
for you.

18:25.312 --> 18:27.815
Of course, she fell for me, and of
course, I wanted no part of her.

18:27.898 --> 18:31.026
Now the only one who can help us
is Stradivarius Cain.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.320
-The guy from the movie?
-I'll explain later.

18:33.403 --> 18:35.197
Strad, come back!

18:35.280 --> 18:36.824
I know you're in there!

18:36.907 --> 18:38.992
No.
Not you.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.661
Big fan, but no.

18:40.744 --> 18:43.038
Cleatus the football robot,
you're my only hope!

18:43.122 --> 18:45.541
(Fox NFL theme plays)

18:51.839 --> 18:53.090
No one likes you!

18:53.173 --> 18:54.883
(machinery whirs)

18:54.967 --> 18:57.136
DRUG LORD:
How can a fat man hide so well?

18:58.762 --> 19:01.348
(hushed)
Strad, where are you?

19:03.308 --> 19:04.935
You can handle him, Homer.

19:05.018 --> 19:07.146
Just remember
what I taught you.

19:08.897 --> 19:10.524
When I was in special ops,

19:10.607 --> 19:12.025
they held me
in an Afghan prison

19:12.109 --> 19:15.028
where all I could see was
a patch of blue sky.

19:15.112 --> 19:16.864
But that blue was
nothing compared

19:16.947 --> 19:19.741
with the blue of your eyes.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.536
I cannot kill
a poet like you.

19:22.619 --> 19:25.038
And you are
a very lucky woman.

19:25.122 --> 19:27.875
This is why I always say
"mingle at parties."

19:27.958 --> 19:29.918
It's how I met Greg Kinnear.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.962
Ay!
With the Greg Kinnear again.

19:32.045 --> 19:33.463
Can't friends talk
about friends?

19:33.547 --> 19:34.882
He is not your friend!

19:34.965 --> 19:37.384
Then why did he say he'd call me
when he comes to Bolivia?

19:37.467 --> 19:39.553
(sighs)

19:39.636 --> 19:41.221
We used to be like them.

19:41.305 --> 19:42.764
Mmm.

19:43.974 --> 19:46.185
So, how many more weeks
do you have off?

19:46.268 --> 19:48.729
Actually, I was supposed
to be back last week.

19:48.812 --> 19:50.272
(laughs)

19:50.355 --> 19:54.067
We'll just wait for the call
from Human Resources.

19:59.448 --> 20:02.075
I guess my work here is done.

20:02.159 --> 20:07.623
But Stradivarius Cain will
return in "Lisa Gets a B Plus."

20:08.457 --> 20:10.042
(gunshot)

20:10.125 --> 20:12.878
I knew you were mad at me.

20:12.961 --> 20:15.547
At the risk
of inflaming Sister Fate,

20:15.631 --> 20:19.134
this bully-free period
has been an Arcadian idyll!

20:19.218 --> 20:20.719
-Hear, hear!
-Idyll!

20:20.802 --> 20:22.137
(gasping)

20:22.221 --> 20:24.389
-Ha-ha!
-(grunts)

20:24.473 --> 20:27.643
(gasping, clamoring)

20:27.726 --> 20:30.395
(Nelson, kids grunting)

20:35.943 --> 20:38.320
I administer with this nose!

20:38.403 --> 20:40.239
This is a happy ending?

20:40.322 --> 20:43.367
Well, he's tough on nerds,
but easy on the eyes.

20:43.450 --> 20:44.868
What'd you just say?

20:44.952 --> 20:46.245
Nothing.

21:31.707 --> 21:33.750
-(crowd murmuring)
-Shh!

21:36.628 --> 21:39.965
