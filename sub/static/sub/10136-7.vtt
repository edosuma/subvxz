07:52.139 --> 07:54.515
- Of course.

07:54.557 --> 07:57.144
We know you're a

07:54.557 --> 07:57.144
struggling musician.

07:58.728 --> 08:01.481
No, no, no. Jess has

07:58.728 --> 08:01.481
a great job on the radio.

08:01.522 --> 08:04.692
And did you know that he had

08:01.522 --> 08:04.692
a number-one record in Japan?

08:04.734 --> 08:07.028
Well, if we ever

08:04.734 --> 08:07.028
have dinner in Japan

08:07.070 --> 08:08.322
it'll be your treat.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.413
Small joke.

08:16.455 --> 08:17.914
That guy is a small joke.

08:17.956 --> 08:18.999
I'm going to get him.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.541
Honey, please.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.541
No violence.

08:20.583 --> 08:21.876
Who's talking

08:20.583 --> 08:21.876
about violence?

08:21.918 --> 08:23.920
I'm gonna order

08:21.918 --> 08:23.920
a 12-pound lobster.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.301
Deej, I took your advice

08:27.174 --> 08:29.301
and called Jimmy.

08:29.343 --> 08:30.969
Was I right?

08:29.343 --> 08:30.969
Does he like you?

08:31.011 --> 08:34.306
Close.

08:31.011 --> 08:34.306
He hates me.

08:34.348 --> 08:35.598
He said if I call him again

08:35.640 --> 08:39.019
he'll have me arrested

08:35.640 --> 08:39.019
for harassment.

08:39.060 --> 08:42.439
Sorry, Steph.

08:39.060 --> 08:42.439
Sometimes guys are complicated.

08:42.481 --> 08:46.067
Well, not exactly complicated.

08:42.481 --> 08:46.067
More like...simple.

08:47.902 --> 08:50.280
I just want to know

08:47.902 --> 08:50.280
how to tell if a guy likes me.

08:50.322 --> 08:52.949
Well, sometimes guys just kinda

08:50.322 --> 08:52.949
hang back and stare at you.

08:52.991 --> 08:56.703
So, if a guy stares at me,

08:52.991 --> 08:56.703
he likes me?

08:56.744 --> 08:58.079
Not necessarily.

08:58.121 --> 09:00.790
You may have some gunk

08:58.121 --> 09:00.790
stuck in your teeth.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.834
But if you don't,

09:00.832 --> 09:02.834
and he does like you

09:02.876 --> 09:05.212
he'll start fixing his hair.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.672
Okay, staring. Hair fixing.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.672
What else? What else?

09:07.714 --> 09:10.091
Well, then you smile at him,

09:07.714 --> 09:10.091
but just a half-smile

09:10.133 --> 09:11.468
'cause you don't

09:10.133 --> 09:11.468
scare him.

09:11.510 --> 09:12.760
How's this?

09:15.389 --> 09:16.764
That'll scare him.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.641
Tell me more.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.641
I need details.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.227
Well, just do

09:18.683 --> 09:20.227
everything I said.

09:20.268 --> 09:22.145
And if you do it right,

09:20.268 --> 09:22.145
he'll come over and talk to you.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.898
This is great.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.898
Then what happens?

09:24.939 --> 09:26.858
Nothing.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.858
You're in the fifth grade.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.698
So, what you guys

09:32.239 --> 09:33.698
want to do?

09:33.740 --> 09:37.869
Do you have a TV? A VCR?

09:33.740 --> 09:37.869
A laser disc player?

09:37.911 --> 09:41.164
- Anything?

09:37.911 --> 09:41.164
- I have Mr. Potato head.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.876
- Boring.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.711
We like video games.

09:46.753 --> 09:47.879
Come on, Debbie.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.257
Let's go play

09:47.921 --> 09:50.257
Ballerinas of Death.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.429
[video games beeping]

09:57.055 --> 09:58.265
When can I have a turn?

09:58.306 --> 09:59.933
When you buy one.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.812
Boy, is this going to

10:01.768 --> 10:04.812
be a fun night.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.862
Man, that was

10:10.402 --> 10:12.862
good eating.

10:12.904 --> 10:15.449
I ate so much lobster,

10:12.904 --> 10:15.449
I'm sweating butter.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.952
I hope you didn't

10:17.033 --> 10:18.952
ruin your best t-shirt.

10:21.662 --> 10:23.415
Oh, Donna, I hope

10:21.662 --> 10:23.415
you don't mind

10:23.457 --> 10:26.293
I made Debbie and Darla

10:23.457 --> 10:26.293
some ice cream sundaes.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.669
Oh, not at all.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.669
Girls, what do you say?

10:28.711 --> 10:32.591
They would have been

10:28.711 --> 10:32.591
better with hot fudge.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.385
Oh, you're welcome.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.385
Always a pleasure.

10:37.220 --> 10:38.930
Oh, uh, Becky

10:38.972 --> 10:40.557

Mary Ellen Matthews

10:40.599 --> 10:43.935
married Doyce Plunk.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.396
He was Becky's

10:43.977 --> 10:46.396
old boyfriend.

10:46.438 --> 10:49.399
We all thought she was

10:46.438 --> 10:49.399
gonna marry him.

10:49.441 --> 10:51.109
I was never going

10:49.441 --> 10:51.109
to marry Doyce.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.778
Mary Ellen sure is

10:51.151 --> 10:53.778
counting her blessings.

10:55.363 --> 10:56.697
She lives in a mansion

10:56.739 --> 10:59.033
almost as big as ours.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.995
And Doyce gives her a brand

Yeah but try popping a wheelie

11:07.083 --> 11:11.463
on one of those things.

11:11.505 --> 11:13.507
Okay.

11:13.548 --> 11:14.715
Well, we better

11:13.548 --> 11:14.715
get a move on

11:14.757 --> 11:16.801
before someone

11:14.757 --> 11:16.801
steals our hubcaps.

11:16.843 --> 11:17.927
Small joke, right?

11:17.969 --> 11:19.554
No, I'm serious.

11:19.596 --> 11:21.139
Come on, girls.

11:19.596 --> 11:21.139
Let's go.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.433
Well, it's been

11:21.181 --> 11:23.433
a wonderful evening.

11:23.475 --> 11:25.810
Cousin Dick,

11:23.475 --> 11:25.810
thank you for dinner.

11:25.852 --> 11:28.313
I'm gonna go upstairs

11:25.852 --> 11:28.313
and check on Nicky and Alex.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.482
Donna, goodnight.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.482
Goodnight, girls.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.400
I'll be up soon, honey.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.400
I'm just gonna throw our..

11:32.442 --> 11:34.777
I mean show our guests out.

Bye-bye.

Bye-bye.

Hey, Dick.

11:39.991 --> 11:42.743
Let's lay the cards

11:39.991 --> 11:42.743
on the table, pal.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.538
You don't like me, do you?

11:46.581 --> 11:48.916
Well, I'd like you

11:46.581 --> 11:48.916
as an acquaintance.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.794
I'd like you

11:48.958 --> 11:51.794
as a waiter.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.796
I'd even like you

11:51.836 --> 11:53.796
as a mechanic.

11:53.838 --> 11:56.132
But as a cousin,

11:53.838 --> 11:56.132
well, let's just say

11:56.174 --> 12:00.554
we always imagined

11:56.174 --> 12:00.554
Rebecca with someone..

12:00.595 --> 12:03.473
...better.

12:03.515 --> 12:04.516
Let me tell you something.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.226
I'm not your acquaintance

12:06.267 --> 12:07.644
and I'm not your waiter

12:07.686 --> 12:08.811
and if I were your mechanic

12:08.853 --> 12:10.230
you'd be having

12:08.853 --> 12:10.230
brake problems.

12:14.609 --> 12:15.902
Small joke.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.072
Well, I guess

12:17.654 --> 12:19.072
we know where we stand.

12:19.113 --> 12:20.823
Yes.

12:19.113 --> 12:20.823
I guess we know.

12:20.865 --> 12:23.034
See you at the expo.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.246
Oh, and smart move

12:23.076 --> 12:26.246
not entering the twins contest.

12:26.287 --> 12:29.874
Why put your kids through

12:26.287 --> 12:29.874
that kind of rejection?

12:29.916 --> 12:32.502
"Rejection?"

12:29.916 --> 12:32.502
Now you've pushed me too far.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.753
You know what, I'm gonna enter

12:32.544 --> 12:34.753
my twins in that contest

12:34.795 --> 12:37.257
and they're gonna make you wish

12:34.795 --> 12:37.257
you never left Nebraska, pal.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.634
Ooh.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.302
Looks like somebody

12:39.676 --> 12:41.302
had their lobster bib on

12:41.344 --> 12:43.804
a little too tight, huh.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.098
- Small joke.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.098
- Yeah.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.351
Here's a big joke for you.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.144
I don't even like lobster.

Hey, kids, look at all

13:09.372 --> 13:11.958
the twins, huh?

13:11.999 --> 13:14.835
Big ones, little ones.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.672
- Furry ones.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.672
- Come on, Michelle.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.006
Let's go see

13:17.714 --> 13:19.006
if they have eyes.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.468
See that doggy?

13:19.048 --> 13:21.468
He's a furry doggy.

13:21.509 --> 13:22.385
Say doggy.

13:22.427 --> 13:26.055
- Hi, hi.

13:22.427 --> 13:26.055
- Oh, hi.

13:28.475 --> 13:29.476
you think, you could

13:28.475 --> 13:29.476
help me carry

13:29.517 --> 13:31.478
that huge trophy

13:29.517 --> 13:31.478
on to my car?

13:31.519 --> 13:33.062
No because my kids

13:31.519 --> 13:33.062
are gonna win.

13:33.104 --> 13:35.565
Really? You think you have

13:33.104 --> 13:35.565
room for that trophy

13:35.607 --> 13:37.191
up there in

13:35.607 --> 13:37.191
the ol' attic?

13:41.321 --> 13:43.490
You know, Jess, I just wanted to

13:41.321 --> 13:43.490
enter this contest for fun

13:43.531 --> 13:45.492
and all you want to

13:43.531 --> 13:45.492
do is beat my cousin.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.243
Sounds like fun to me.

13:47.285 --> 13:48.745
Come on, let's go

13:47.285 --> 13:48.745
get the kids ready.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.003
Hey, Michelle.

13:57.044 --> 13:59.880
Are those cute guys

13:57.044 --> 13:59.880
staring at me?

13:59.922 --> 14:02.008
No, don't look at them.

14:02.049 --> 14:05.052
How am I supposed to see

14:02.049 --> 14:05.052
'em if I don't look?

14:05.094 --> 14:08.431
Okay, time for the half-smile.

14:05.094 --> 14:08.431
How's this?

14:10.141 --> 14:12.143
I think you need

14:10.141 --> 14:12.143
the other half.

Alright.

14:27.116 --> 14:30.328
asked nicely

okay.

- I'm Stephanie.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.002
- I'm Thomas.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.714
- Do you have a twin?

14:38.044 --> 14:40.714
- No.

14:40.755 --> 14:44.091
We really like doing

14:40.755 --> 14:44.091
stuff with twins.

14:44.133 --> 14:47.011

Who doesn't?

14:48.012 --> 14:50.014
Super.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.014
Where is she?

14:50.056 --> 14:52.559

14:50.056 --> 14:52.559
I'll go find her.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.980
D.J., quick. I need your hat

14:56.062 --> 14:57.980
and your sweater.

14:58.022 --> 14:59.524
- Why?

14:58.022 --> 14:59.524
- Don't ask questions.

14:59.566 --> 15:00.983
It's an emergency.

14:59.566 --> 15:00.983
Please. Please.

15:01.025 --> 15:03.277
Okay, okay.

15:01.025 --> 15:03.277
But you look fine.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.780
It's not for me.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.780
It's for my sister.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.156
Michelle?

15:10.993 --> 15:13.037
Hi. You must be

15:10.993 --> 15:13.037
Andrew and Thomas.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.415
My sister Stephanie

15:13.079 --> 15:15.415
told me I'd found you here.

15:15.456 --> 15:18.000
Hi. What's your name?

My name?

15:19.335 --> 15:22.589
Uh...Bethany.

15:22.630 --> 15:26.676
So, Bethany, what do you

15:22.630 --> 15:26.676
and Stephanie do for fun?

15:26.718 --> 15:30.179
Oh, pretty much
