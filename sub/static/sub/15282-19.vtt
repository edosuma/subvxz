00:28.362 --> 00:30.425
Brian matloff, this is the fbi!

00:30.425 --> 00:32.612
We have a warrant for your arrest!

00:39.375 --> 00:40.112
Clear!

00:42.425 --> 00:43.488
Clear!

00:44.237 --> 00:45.488
Clear!

00:54.300 --> 00:55.862
He's going to the roof!

01:14.000 --> 01:15.941
You got nowhere to go, man.

01:17.062 --> 01:18.112
Matloff!

01:29.050 --> 01:30.550
Hang on, man! I'm coming over there.

01:34.753 --> 01:35.800
Morgan, don't do it!

01:44.284 --> 01:45.862
No!

02:19.660 --> 02:20.675
He's still alive.

02:21.438 --> 02:22.800
Not for long.

02:24.375 --> 02:25.425
Not after that.

02:25.425 --> 02:29.253
We need e.M.S., southside alleyway. Send them now.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.422
???????

02:36.422 --> 02:38.253
It's remarkable.

02:38.253 --> 02:40.550
Something like this makes you question everything you thought you knew.

02:40.550 --> 02:43.425
Yeah. It's like the monolith in 2001.

02:43.425 --> 02:46.237
So there was actually a time when something like this was socially acceptable?

02:46.237 --> 02:47.875
Oh...you're young.

02:48.750 --> 02:50.940
The eighties left a lot of people confused.

02:51.438 --> 02:54.925
This is, uh, especially sad, though.

02:54.938 --> 02:57.175
All right, very funny, you guys. Very funny.

02:57.175 --> 02:58.847
What did you do to it?
Do?

02:58.847 --> 03:01.800
Well, you obviously altered it in photoshop or something. That hair?

03:01.800 --> 03:04.253
Oh, no, pussycat. That's all you.

03:04.862 --> 03:06.441
Garfield high, class of '89.

03:07.375 --> 03:08.999
You really didn't change anything?

03:08.999 --> 03:10.331
I hacked it, as is.

03:10.331 --> 03:13.440
You're seriously trying to tell me
you don't remember  rocking that look?

03:13.440 --> 03:17.675
Perhaps your lack of recognition stems
from a dissociative fugue suffered in adolescence,

03:17.675 --> 03:19.957
Say, at a siouxsie and the banshees concert.

03:20.550 --> 03:21.613
It's so weird.

03:21.925 --> 03:23.800
It's like some other life.

03:24.875 --> 03:27.143
What was that about? Brian matloff.

03:27.438 --> 03:30.613
Who? Uh, aka the blue ridge strangler.

03:30.613 --> 03:32.999
Oh, right. That was, like, 4 years ago.

03:32.999 --> 03:34.999
3 victims in the blue ridge parkway.

03:35.265 --> 03:36.613
Allegedly. He was never convicted.

03:36.613 --> 03:38.862
He slipped into a coma before he could be tried.

03:38.862 --> 03:40.988
Looks like they're finally gonna get their chance.

03:41.112 --> 03:42.316
He just woke up.

03:42.316 --> 03:44.925
I don't care. If his name's on the file, pull it.

03:44.925 --> 03:45.925
I gotta go.

03:48.625 --> 03:49.425
How are you, cece?

03:49.425 --> 03:51.503
Good. Quite a turn, huh? Yeah.

03:51.503 --> 03:52.925
Thanks for coming down.

03:52.925 --> 03:55.050
So what's your plan? Plan?

03:55.453 --> 03:57.987
Try him and fry him. Ms. Hillenbrand?

03:57.987 --> 03:59.987
You can come back now. Ok.

04:00.300 --> 04:02.863
The indictment is still alive and i want you on board to testify.

04:02.863 --> 04:05.675
Sure, whatever i can do. But 4 years is a long time.

04:05.675 --> 04:07.925
Meaning what? The indictment may be intact,

04:07.925 --> 04:11.566
But the case won't be. People move on, retire, evidence degrades.

04:11.566 --> 04:12.550
Right.

04:12.550 --> 04:14.487
I forgot you used to be a prosecutor.

04:14.487 --> 04:17.613
And i got burned more than once when time dangech the fabric of a case.

04:17.613 --> 04:19.800
Well, time hasn't changed the facts.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.660
He killed 3 people, maybe more.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.315
Who knows? Maybe rip van winkle's ready to come clean.

04:26.062 --> 04:29.050
If you're talking about mr. Matloff,  i'm afraid  that's not likely.

04:29.050 --> 04:31.987
The patient has focal retrograde amnesia. What?

04:32.500 --> 04:35.315
You're telling me he doesn't remember the murders?

04:35.315 --> 04:37.112
He can't even remember his name.

"All changes,even the most longed for, "have their melancholy.

05:27.250 --> 05:30.737
"For what we leave behind us "is a part of ourselves.

05:32.250 --> 05:37.550
"We must die to one life before we can enter another." Anatole france.

05:38.062 --> 05:39.425
A hadhe type.

05:39.425 --> 05:41.300
Brunette, young.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.362
They were jogging?

05:42.362 --> 05:44.628
Alone, early in the morning. Easy prey.

05:45.703 --> 05:48.190
Well, that's about the worst news i could have gotten.

05:48.797 --> 05:53.050
Marvin leopold, our only key witness, died 2 years ago.

05:53.050 --> 05:53.941
He o.D.?

05:53.941 --> 05:56.456
How'd you know? I remember he had a heroin problem.

05:56.456 --> 05:57.737
Your best witness was a junkie?

05:57.737 --> 06:02.238
It was solid. He put matloff at the park with darci corbett, victim number 3.

06:02.238 --> 06:05.425
The warrant and the indictment were made largely on the witness.

06:05.425 --> 06:06.925
Everything else is circumstantial.

06:06.925 --> 06:09.800
I could name a dozen killers we got convicted with less.

06:09.800 --> 06:13.925
Well, you're not the one arguing a rail-Thin case in front of the 23rd circuit.

06:13.925 --> 06:16.675
The rocket docket. Gives me half the time to prepare.

06:16.675 --> 06:17.768
I can help you prep.

06:17.768 --> 06:20.612
And i'll go over the case with our team. The local detective retired.

06:20.612 --> 06:22.999
There may be lines of investigation that fell off.

06:22.999 --> 06:24.175
Cece: i appreciate it.

06:24.359 --> 06:26.050
We're not just doing it for you.

06:26.437 --> 06:27.999
We're doing it for them.

06:33.999 --> 06:35.675
???????

06:35.675 --> 06:38.347
Detective. Wish i could say it was good to see you again.

06:39.362 --> 06:42.238
This is our, uh, newest agent dr. Spencer reid.

06:42.238 --> 06:44.472
Ted jarvis. A little young, aren't you?

06:44.472 --> 06:46.175
No offense. None taken.

06:46.175 --> 06:49.300
In fact, neural processing speeds reach their maximum at around age 15,

06:49.300 --> 06:52.425
So when it comes to being affected by crime scenes and other graphic visual input,

06:52.425 --> 06:54.753
We're all really the same age. Hotch: reid.

06:54.875 --> 06:56.300
Tell me what you see.

06:57.112 --> 07:00.456
Ligature marks seem to match that of the previous 2 victims.

07:00.456 --> 07:02.815
He uses a belt. It's his signature.

07:03.550 --> 07:05.722
Tan line on the wrist means her watch is missing.

07:05.722 --> 07:06.769
He takes trophies.

07:06.769 --> 07:08.550
They're always buried facedown.

07:08.550 --> 07:09.613
It's a sign of remorse.

07:09.613 --> 07:11.253
He can't bear looking them in the face.

07:11.425 --> 07:12.784
So he knows them personally?

07:12.784 --> 07:14.999
You don't have to know somebody to regret killing them.

07:14.999 --> 07:16.737
No, he picks these women because he can.

07:16.737 --> 07:17.738
He's opportunistic.

07:17.738 --> 07:20.331
These victims happened to be in the wrong place at the right time.

07:20.331 --> 07:22.175
Bogey coming in.

07:23.487 --> 07:24.441
The father?

07:24.900 --> 07:28.175
Don't suppose you guys want to rochambeau for the privilege?

07:29.375 --> 07:30.441
I'll go.

07:31.875 --> 07:33.500
Go get 'em, tiger.

07:39.813 --> 07:41.378
It's her, isn't it?

07:42.125 --> 07:43.438
It's my darci.

07:43.488 --> 07:45.863
It might be, sir, but if it is,

07:45.863 --> 07:47.675
You don't want to see her.

07:47.675 --> 07:49.999
This isn't a memory that you want.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.519
After the raid on matloff's apartment,

08:00.519 --> 08:02.925
We discovered he had another area of interest.

08:02.925 --> 08:05.612
Native american mythology.

08:05.612 --> 08:07.863
We realized our profile wasn't complete.

08:07.863 --> 08:09.518
There's a native american believe that says

08:09.518 --> 08:13.456
Burying a body facedown traps the soul and prevents it from haunting the killer.

08:13.456 --> 08:14.488
That's why he buried them like this?

08:14.488 --> 08:15.640
That was the theory.

08:15.690 --> 08:17.175
3 women in shallow graves.

08:17.175 --> 08:19.062
I don't see any progression.

08:19.112 --> 08:20.566
There's no learning curve.

08:20.566 --> 08:21.831
Do you think there could have been more,

08:21.831 --> 08:23.600
Earlier victims when he was honing his skills?

08:23.700 --> 08:24.866
We considered it
a possibility.

08:24.933 --> 08:27.487
It turned out matloff
worked in blue ridge parkway

08:27.487 --> 08:28.334
For the forest service.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.267
He had free reign
over the entire park.

08:30.334 --> 08:32.533
It says here he was
raised polish catholic.

08:32.599 --> 08:36.111
Any idea what led him to identify
with native american culture?

08:36.111 --> 08:37.111
We didn't get that far.

08:37.111 --> 08:39.331
Another thing we never got
was any physical evidee

08:39.331 --> 08:41.236
At his apartment
tying him to the crimes.

08:41.236 --> 08:43.222
What about the jewelry he took,
the souvenirs?

08:43.222 --> 08:44.550
No trace.

08:44.550 --> 08:45.882
So what did he do with him?

08:45.949 --> 08:48.862
Well, if we didn't need the
answer to that before, we do now.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.737
It turns out our star witness
has been dead for 2 years.

08:53.188 --> 08:55.987
He was the only one who could
put matloff at the scene.

08:58.844 --> 09:00.050
There might be another way.

09:01.815 --> 09:03.715
We'd like to request
that the defendant

09:03.782 --> 09:06.449
Undergo the process
of brain fingerprinting.

09:06.516 --> 09:08.238
This procedure will show

09:08.238 --> 09:09.383
If the memories
of the crimes

09:09.449 --> 09:12.050
Are present in the mind
of the defendant,

09:12.050 --> 09:14.769
Regardless of whether or not
he chooses to recall them.

09:14.769 --> 09:16.487
Your honor,
where do i begin?

09:16.487 --> 09:18.050
The science
on this type of testing

09:18.050 --> 09:19.222
Is unproven,
to say the least.

09:19.222 --> 09:21.722
<i>In the state of iowa
vs. Terry harrington,</i>

09:21.722 --> 09:24.675
The results were ruled
admissible as scientific evidence

09:24.675 --> 09:26.862
As defined in
congress ruling 702

09:26.862 --> 09:28.016
<i>And in daubert v. Merrell.</i>

09:28.082 --> 09:29.675
This is a hail mary,
your honor.

09:29.675 --> 09:31.383
They have no evidence
and they know it.

09:31.449 --> 09:33.049
And beyond that,
my client

09:33.116 --> 09:35.129
Is in a very fragile
mental state.

09:35.129 --> 09:38.283
I can't in good conscience let
them go poking around in his brain.

09:38.349 --> 09:40.987
What about that?
Is it safe?

09:43.050 --> 09:45.441
The test is non-Invasive
and completely safe.

09:45.441 --> 09:47.708
They'll simply be looking at
images on a computer screen

09:47.775 --> 09:50.175
While an eeg monitors
his brain activity.

09:50.175 --> 09:53.566
Subject him to graphic imagery
to prompt some kind of reaction,

09:53.566 --> 09:55.866
Which they can then point to
as evidence of guilt?

09:55.933 --> 09:57.666
It's perverse.
I object to even-

09:57.732 --> 09:59.699
I want to do it.

10:02.899 --> 10:05.632
Just one moment, your honor.

10:07.232 --> 10:09.332
Your honor...

10:09.399 --> 10:13.165
Every day i waken to this, uh...

10:13.232 --> 10:15.098
Nightmare

10:15.165 --> 10:17.465
Of not knowing who or...

10:17.532 --> 10:19.299
What i am,

10:19.365 --> 10:23.966
And if this test
can really help me remember,

10:24.033 --> 10:26.033
Then whatever the consequences,

10:26.098 --> 10:28.033
I- I want to do it.

10:28.098 --> 10:29.933
I have to.

10:34.098 --> 10:36.365
Dr. Reid.

10:36.432 --> 10:38.363
Mr. Corbett.

10:38.363 --> 10:40.033
I didn't see you in there.
How have you been?

10:40.098 --> 10:41.632
Oh... not bad,

10:41.699 --> 10:43.432
Considering. Um...

10:43.499 --> 10:45.866
You aren't not buying this
amnesia thing, are you?

10:45.933 --> 10:48.160
I'm trying to figure that out.

10:48.160 --> 10:50.966
It's probably something
the lawyer thought up.

10:51.033 --> 10:52.175
It won't work, will it?

10:52.175 --> 10:53.737
We have a pretty strong case.

10:53.737 --> 10:55.799
Good. That's good.

10:55.866 --> 10:57.332
You look different.

10:57.399 --> 10:58.999
Your hair.

10:59.065 --> 11:00.666
It's been 4 years.

11:00.732 --> 11:02.699
Right. I forget.

11:02.766 --> 11:06.666
Sometimes i feel like
darci's just...

11:06.732 --> 11:09.499
Ah-It messes with time,
this thing.

11:09.566 --> 11:11.432
You know? You lose time.

11:11.499 --> 11:13.599
Yeah. I know.

11:13.666 --> 11:16.753
You always hear about
closure, you know?

11:16.753 --> 11:18.832
Andyou never really
knowwhat that means.

11:18.899 --> 11:21.265
Maybe now i can...

11:21.332 --> 11:22.866
Get on with things,
you know?

11:23.175 --> 11:25.332
How's mrs. Corbett doing?

11:25.399 --> 11:26.432
Is, uh, she here?

11:26.499 --> 11:28.332
Oh, no, no, no.
She's, uh...

11:28.399 --> 11:29.599
We split up.

11:29.666 --> 11:32.065
It...

11:32.132 --> 11:35.033
Was hard to...

11:35.098 --> 11:36.966
It was my fault, really.

11:37.033 --> 11:38.999
I'm sure it was just,
you know...

11:39.862 --> 11:41.033
It happens.

11:41.766 --> 11:43.866
Yeah. It's ok.

11:44.879 --> 11:47.632
Everything's
gonna be ok now.

11:52.966 --> 11:55.899
You're with the fbi, right?

11:55.966 --> 11:57.499
You don't remember me?

11:57.566 --> 11:59.799
We met during
the investigation.

12:02.399 --> 12:06.332
So... you don't have
any doubts, then,

12:06.399 --> 12:07.933
About me,

12:07.999 --> 12:09.332
Who and what i am?

12:09.399 --> 12:11.866
No, i don't.

12:11.933 --> 12:13.165
We're ready here.

13:06.966 --> 13:09.198
Yeah, jj.
I'm in with matloff.

13:09.265 --> 13:11.432
I'm at the hospital. I may
have something interesting.

13:11.499 --> 13:12.347
What have you got?

13:12.347 --> 13:15.465
Matloff had a visitor that
came about once every 6 months

13:15.532 --> 13:16.499
While he was here.

13:16.566 --> 13:17.666
Somebody we know?

13:17.732 --> 13:20.232
It's not a name i recognize
from the case file.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.566
The name on the visitor log
is nina moore.

13:22.632 --> 13:24.232
Track her down.
I gotta go.

13:24.299 --> 13:25.362
I'm on it.

13:25.362 --> 13:27.666
He tested no mermers
across the board,

13:27.732 --> 13:28.899
On each variable image.

13:28.966 --> 13:29.799
Mermers?

13:29.866 --> 13:31.332
It's an acronym.

13:31.399 --> 13:33.613
Memory and encoding related
multi-Faceted-

13:33.613 --> 13:34.499
Is it good or bad?

13:34.566 --> 13:35.706
Depends on how you look at it.

13:35.706 --> 13:38.432
It means he showed no
familiarity with the images.

13:38.499 --> 13:40.499
Either he really
doesn't remember-

13:40.566 --> 13:42.300
Or we got the wrong guy.

13:47.859 --> 13:49.363
The brain fingerprinting

13:49.363 --> 13:52.050
May have just killed any chance
we have of putting matloff away.

13:52.050 --> 13:53.999
The d.A. Isn't required
to enter it into evidence.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.425
No, but he can get it
on discovery

13:55.425 --> 13:56.675
And you can bet
he's gonna use it.

13:56.675 --> 13:58.576
And that's why i distrust
all technology.

13:58.642 --> 14:00.254
So how'd he get over?

14:00.254 --> 14:01.742
I thought nobody
could beat this test.

14:01.809 --> 14:03.343
The damage
to his parietal lobe

14:03.409 --> 14:05.316
Must have been more extensive
than previously thought.

14:05.316 --> 14:06.176
The brain injury
could have literally

14:06.243 --> 14:07.276
Deleted his memories.

14:07.343 --> 14:08.775
Oh, he did the murders,
and we'll prove it.

14:08.842 --> 14:09.909
What he remembers
doesn't matter.

14:09.976 --> 14:12.009
Doesn't it?
I mean, if those experiences

14:12.076 --> 14:15.143
Are gone forever, doesn't that sort
of make him, i don't know, like...

14:15.209 --> 14:16.343
Yeah.
Different person?

14:16.409 --> 14:17.300
No, not at all.

14:17.300 --> 14:18.576
Not to me.
It's interesting-

14:18.642 --> 14:20.175
It goes to core arguments

14:20.175 --> 14:21.487
About the nature
of identity.

14:21.487 --> 14:22.709
There's a western
philosophical concept,

14:22.775 --> 14:25.816
Causal dependence, that says that
a psyological connection to the past

14:25.816 --> 14:27.109
Plays a key role
in defining who we are.

14:27.176 --> 14:28.976
Reid, what are you saying, that
this guy shouldn't be tried?

14:29.042 --> 14:30.050
I'm not saying that.

14:30.050 --> 14:31.343
Prentiss: but one could
make the argument

14:31.409 --> 14:32.642
That in his current condition

14:32.709 --> 14:34.675
He's no longer
a danger to society.

14:34.742 --> 14:35.942
Not until he gets
his memory back.

14:36.009 --> 14:38.128
But it's not just about
this guy being a danger.

14:38.128 --> 14:39.376
It's about making sure
somebody pays

14:39.443 --> 14:40.675
For what happened
to those girls.

14:40.675 --> 14:43.191
Well, it's not up to us to decide
to what extent he should be punished.

14:43.191 --> 14:45.159
That's for the courts. Where are
we with matloff's mystery visitor?

14:45.159 --> 14:48.176
Prentiss and i contacted
every recorded nina moore

14:48.243 --> 14:49.976
Within 500 miles
of the hospital.

14:50.042 --> 14:51.942
71 in total, no takers.

14:52.009 --> 14:54.847
Matloff's a textbook loner.
No meaningful relationships,

14:54.847 --> 14:55.976
No family, no girlfriends.

14:56.042 --> 14:57.809
But anyone who would visit
a coma patient-

14:57.876 --> 14:59.209
A triple murderer
coma patient.

14:59.276 --> 15:01.809
We're talking about somebody
who feels connected to him.

15:01.876 --> 15:03.742
Maybe connected enough
to know the truth.

15:03.809 --> 15:05.309
The truth could be
she's just a fan.

15:05.376 --> 15:06.987
Every serial killer's
got 'em.

15:06.987 --> 15:08.842
Let's go back to the hospital
and interview the staff.

15:08.909 --> 15:10.999
We need to build a profile
and help locate this woman.

15:27.909 --> 15:30.343
You all right in there?

15:30.409 --> 15:32.543
You were screaming.

15:32.610 --> 15:34.543
It was just a dream.

15:36.510 --> 15:38.376
I guess i'm...

15:38.443 --> 15:41.143
Anxious with the trial...

15:41.209 --> 15:42.876
Starting tomorrow.

15:44.143 --> 15:47.543
You passed that brain test
thing, right?

15:47.610 --> 15:48.775
That's good.

15:50.175 --> 15:51.675
Suppose i could get...

15:51.742 --> 15:53.309
Something to...

15:53.376 --> 15:56.243
Write with
and a piece of paper?

15:56.309 --> 15:58.109
Doctor said
it'd be good for...

15:58.176 --> 16:00.076
I'll see what i can do.

16:00.143 --> 16:02.709
Hey, what's that smell?

16:03.543 --> 16:05.443
Um...

16:05.510 --> 16:07.409
It's popcorn.

16:07.476 --> 16:09.243
Popcorn?

16:09.309 --> 16:11.109
Bill made some
on his break.

16:12.425 --> 16:14.942
Do i like popcorn?

16:20.343 --> 16:21.842
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:21.909 --> 16:24.175
You are here
to bring justice

16:24.175 --> 16:26.876
To the families
of 3 beautiful young women

16:26.942 --> 16:28.675
Whose lives were cut short

16:28.742 --> 16:31.042
By a cold
and calculating killer.

16:31.109 --> 16:33.009
Darci corbett,

16:33.076 --> 16:34.876
Celeste ferami,

16:34.942 --> 16:36.675
April sotherford.

16:36.742 --> 16:39.999
3 women out for a run
or a jog in the park

16:39.999 --> 16:43.343
When they were approached by an
employee of the forestry service.

16:43.409 --> 16:45.976
An employee
who used his authority

16:46.042 --> 16:48.642
To lure these women
into a secluded area

16:48.709 --> 16:51.309
Where he could safely
perform the act of murder.

16:51.376 --> 16:53.143
Was it the work
of a serial killer?

16:53.209 --> 16:54.642
Perhaps.

16:54.709 --> 16:56.809
But the theory
that my client

16:56.876 --> 16:58.909
Is the responsible party
is just that-

16:58.976 --> 17:00.309
A theory.

17:00.376 --> 17:02.309
He strangled them slowly,

17:02.376 --> 17:04.809
Inflicting maximum
suffering and terror,

17:04.876 --> 17:07.976
And in the process,
turned the blue ride parkway

17:08.041 --> 17:09.642
Into his own private
killing fields.

17:09.709 --> 17:12.709
No eyewitness,
no fingerprints, no dna,

17:12.775 --> 17:14.409
No murder weapon.

17:14.476 --> 17:16.675
Not one shred of hard evidence.

17:16.742 --> 17:18.842
The only way that
they can tie my client

17:18.909 --> 17:20.343
To these crimes

17:20.409 --> 17:22.842
Is through the pseudo-Science
called profiling.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.343
At the close
of evidence,

17:24.409 --> 17:25.675
You will know

17:25.742 --> 17:28.175
That brian matloff

17:28.242 --> 17:30.675
Is the man who
committed these crimes,

17:30.742 --> 17:33.675
Whher he remembers it
or not.

17:34.238 --> 17:37.343
So, through this process
of lkage analysis,

17:37.409 --> 17:39.206
You concluded
that all 3 murders

17:39.206 --> 17:40.800
Were perpetrated
by one man.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.409
Yes, that's correct.

17:42.476 --> 17:44.842
And you believe that man
is brian matloff?

17:44.909 --> 17:46.276
Yes, i do.

17:46.409 --> 17:48.925
Can you tell us how you
came to that conclusion?

17:48.925 --> 17:50.643
Along with agents
reid and morgan,

17:50.643 --> 17:52.576
We began to analyze
the behavior

17:52.642 --> 17:54.143
Of the unknown subject

17:54.209 --> 17:56.143
As manifested before,
during, and after

17:56.209 --> 17:57.876
The commission
of the murders.

17:57.942 --> 17:59.876
Our goal was to generate
a suspect pool,

17:59.942 --> 18:03.276
A list of names which we'd
eventually narrow down to one person.

18:03.362 --> 18:06.276
He hunts 200,000 acres
like it's his own backyard.

18:06.343 --> 18:09.476
He attacks high-Risk victims,
young, strong female joggers,

18:09.543 --> 18:10.909
But in low-Risk locations.

18:10.976 --> 18:13.510
Like david carpenter,
the trailside killer.

18:13.576 --> 18:14.476
Are there other parallels?

18:14.543 --> 18:15.942
This guy's different.

18:16.009 --> 18:17.610
Carpenter used
a blitz attack.

18:17.675 --> 18:19.809
This unsub insinuates himself,
disarms the victims.

18:19.876 --> 18:21.809
Maybe he uses a con,

18:21.876 --> 18:23.610
Playing the injured
hiker, lost dog?

18:23.709 --> 18:24.842
Too many variables.

18:24.909 --> 18:28.176
She could run for help
or call 911 on her cell phone

18:28.243 --> 18:29.809
Before he gains control.

18:30.642 --> 18:31.942
Control.

18:32.009 --> 18:33.909
He's in a position
of authority.

18:33.976 --> 18:35.503
But not law enforcement.

18:35.503 --> 18:37.576
A cop would know better than to
bury a body in 2 feet of dirt.

18:37.642 --> 18:39.942
The forest service would give
him access to service roads.

18:40.009 --> 18:41.510
This deduction revealed to us

18:41.576 --> 18:43.842
How the killer gained
satisfaction from his crimes.

18:43.909 --> 18:45.343
By burying the victims
in the park,

18:45.409 --> 18:47.510
He was able to revisit
the scene

18:47.576 --> 18:49.276
And relive his acts
over and over.

18:49.343 --> 18:51.809
So, i imagine there are
a lot of people

18:51.876 --> 18:53.443
Who work for
the forest service.

18:53.510 --> 18:56.443
1,718 employees.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.009
He won't be a new employee.

18:58.076 --> 18:59.543
He's cautious, he's organized.

18:59.610 --> 19:01.376
He leaves behind
no trace evidence.

19:01.443 --> 19:02.510
He's bordering on paranoid.

19:02.576 --> 19:03.876
He's the kind of guy
who needs to know

19:03.942 --> 19:05.076
Exactly what the cops know.

19:05.143 --> 19:06.476
He's probably inserted
himself

19:06.543 --> 19:09.009
Into the investigation
already.

19:09.076 --> 19:11.976
Hey, what's that new
tech girl's name?

19:12.042 --> 19:13.309
Uh...

19:13.376 --> 19:15.143
Gomez, i think.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.842
Excuse me, gomez.

19:18.909 --> 19:20.842
Hey, baby girl.

19:24.309 --> 19:25.909
Baby girl?

19:25.976 --> 19:27.775
Forgive me. I just
didn't know the real-

19:27.842 --> 19:29.675
I've been called worse.

19:29.742 --> 19:31.315
What can i do for you?

19:31.315 --> 19:35.176
And what did technical
analyst garcia do at that time?

19:35.243 --> 19:38.409
We asked her to check names
of forestry employees

19:38.476 --> 19:39.842
Against a list of witnesses

19:39.909 --> 19:41.737
Interviewed
by the roanoke police.

19:41.737 --> 19:43.976
And were you able to find
a common denominator?

19:44.042 --> 19:45.143
Yes, one.

19:45.209 --> 19:46.706
Brian matloff.

19:46.706 --> 19:48.642
Of course it went well.
I taught him everything he knows

19:48.709 --> 19:50.109
About giving testimony.

19:50.176 --> 19:52.343
How'd the jury react?

19:52.409 --> 19:54.343
Good.

19:54.409 --> 19:56.009
Ok. Give me a call

19:56.076 --> 19:58.050
After the defense
has had a go at him.

19:59.376 --> 20:00.842
Reid says thing are good
at the trial.

20:00.909 --> 20:02.737
How did it go
at the hospital?

20:02.737 --> 20:03.707
Our interviews filled in
some blanks

20:03.707 --> 20:05.628
About the woman
who vited matloff.

20:05.628 --> 20:07.610
Uh, late 40s to mid-50s,

20:07.675 --> 20:09.510
With quiet,
almost nervous demeanor.

20:09.576 --> 20:12.076
On her first visit, she didn't
even make it into the room.

20:12.143 --> 20:14.510
She just stood in the doorway and
watched for a few minutes and then left.

20:14.576 --> 20:15.510
And on later visits,

20:15.576 --> 20:17.443
She'd what, sit with him,
talk to him?

20:17.510 --> 20:18.610
Read to him.

20:18.675 --> 20:20.510
On more than one occasion,

20:20.576 --> 20:22.376
She asked the nurses
about his condition,

20:22.443 --> 20:24.942
And they said she appeared
"concerned with his pain."

20:25.009 --> 20:26.809
That sounds almost maternal.

20:26.876 --> 20:28.742
We thought so, too,

20:28.809 --> 20:31.675
But his parents effectively
disowned him after the indictment.

20:31.675 --> 20:34.376
So we called his mother
to make sure,

20:34.443 --> 20:35.809
Got to talking,
and guess what.

20:35.876 --> 20:36.942
She's not his mother.

20:37.009 --> 20:38.410
And his father's
not his father.

20:39.300 --> 20:40.243
Matloff was adopted?

20:40.309 --> 20:42.642
This visitor could be
his birth mother.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.276
She's the right age.

20:44.343 --> 20:46.176
They may have had a relationship
that no one knew about.

20:46.243 --> 20:48.610
What other physical
description did you get?

20:48.675 --> 20:50.842
Uh, brunette, brown eyes,
dark complexion.

20:50.909 --> 20:55.343
One nurse thought hispanic,
another one said mediterranean.

20:55.409 --> 20:57.476
What about native american?

20:57.543 --> 21:00.042
That would explain his
interest in the culture.

21:00.109 --> 21:03.209
He's trying to get in touch
with his roots.

21:03.276 --> 21:06.343
Now, my client
ran from the police,

21:06.409 --> 21:07.876
A behavior
that you called

21:07.942 --> 21:10.487
A strong indicator
of his guilt.

21:10.487 --> 21:11.376
Yes, that's correct.

21:11.443 --> 21:12.976
Were you aware that

21:13.042 --> 21:14.642
He had
an outstanding warrant

21:14.709 --> 21:16.343
At the time of his arrest?

21:16.409 --> 21:19.343
Yes. I believe it was for an
automobile accident, a hit and run.

21:19.409 --> 21:23.237
So isn't it possible
that mr. Matloff fled

21:23.237 --> 21:24.909
Not because
he was guilty of murder,

21:24.976 --> 21:26.642
But because of
this other warrant?

21:26.709 --> 21:30.143
There were 8 law enforcement
officers in bulletproof vests.

21:30.209 --> 21:31.576
I doubt any reasonable
person would assume-

21:31.642 --> 21:33.675
A yes or no answer
will do.

21:33.742 --> 21:35.042
Yes, it's possible.

21:36.576 --> 21:39.050
Right. 54, native american.

21:39.050 --> 21:44.015
Ma'am, i have all that. What i really
need now is identifiable information.

21:45.300 --> 21:47.582
Yes, i know what
a closed adoption means.

21:47.582 --> 21:48.409
Do you know
what a court order means?

21:48.476 --> 21:50.942
We don't
have time for court orders.

21:51.009 --> 21:53.510
You know what, ma'am?
I am done being nice.

21:53.576 --> 21:55.942
If you look to your cursor, you'll
notice it's moving on its own.

21:56.009 --> 21:58.510
That's me hacking
your secure network.

21:58.576 --> 22:01.809
Now i got her file,
now i got her social,

22:01.876 --> 22:03.443
And now,
'cause you're grumpy,

22:03.510 --> 22:06.243
I'm gonna send your boss
these jamaican vacation photos.

22:06.309 --> 22:09.576
Check you out-
No tan lines.

22:09.642 --> 22:12.675
Nina genesee,
married in 1978,

22:12.742 --> 22:13.842
Changed her name to moore,

22:13.909 --> 22:15.443
Current address
madison heights, virginia.

22:15.510 --> 22:17.610
Madison heights.

22:17.709 --> 22:19.476
No, i called this woman.
She said she wasn't the one.

22:19.543 --> 22:21.443
Said she'd never even
been to roanoke.

22:21.510 --> 22:22.581
Why would she lie?

22:22.581 --> 22:26.076
And why hasn't she tried
to see him since he woke up?

22:26.143 --> 22:29.576
So, you've stated that it
was your profile of the killer

22:29.642 --> 22:31.503
That led you and the police

22:31.503 --> 22:32.899
To my client's door
that night.

22:32.900 --> 22:36.200
Behavioral analysis was a
factor in our investigation, yes.

22:36.200 --> 22:38.700
And was behavioral
analysis also a factor

22:38.700 --> 22:41.400
In the olympic park
bombings case in atlanta?

22:41.400 --> 22:42.100
Yes, it was.

22:42.100 --> 22:45.300
And was that suspect
you identified, richard jewell,

22:45.300 --> 22:46.800
Ever convicted
of the bombings?

22:46.800 --> 22:48.600
Objection.
Relevance.

22:48.600 --> 22:51.100
Goes to the credibility
of the witness and his field.

22:51.400 --> 22:52.200
I'll allow it.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.400
No, he was not
convicted.

22:54.900 --> 22:56.400
Because he was innocent.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.600
Your profile led you
to the wrong man.

22:58.700 --> 23:01.200
Jewell was not the perpetrator,
but if you look at the real

23:01.200 --> 23:02.900
Olympic park bomber,
eric rudolph,

23:02.900 --> 23:04.900
You'll see that our profile
was dead on.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.200
Well, how about if we look
at the baton rouge killer?

23:07.200 --> 23:09.700
Your unit said
that hwas white

23:09.700 --> 23:10.700
And living in the city.

23:10.700 --> 23:12.700
He was black
and from the suburbs.

23:12.700 --> 23:15.300
You said that dennis rader,
the btk killer,

23:15.300 --> 23:17.300
Was divorced and impotent.

23:17.300 --> 23:19.300
He turned out to be
married with 2 kids.

23:19.300 --> 23:20.800
Objection, your honor.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.200
He's giving a sermon.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.500
Do you have a question
in there somewhere, counselor?

23:24.500 --> 23:26.400
Having been wrong
on those cases,

23:26.400 --> 23:30.000
Isn't it possible that you
were wrong about brian matloff?

23:30.000 --> 23:30.800
No.

23:30.800 --> 23:33.100
The fact is,
behavioral analysis

23:33.100 --> 23:35.400
Is really just
intellectual guesswork.

23:35.800 --> 23:38.200
You probably couldn't tell
me the color of my socks

23:38.200 --> 23:40.900
With any greater accuracy
than a carnival psychic.

23:41.100 --> 23:41.900
Objection.

23:41.900 --> 23:42.900
Withdrawn.

23:44.100 --> 23:45.200
Charcoal gray.

23:47.900 --> 23:48.800
Well, look at that.

23:49.600 --> 23:50.700
He got one right.

23:51.500 --> 23:53.000
You match them
to the color of your suit

23:53.000 --> 23:55.500
To appear taller.
You also wear lifts

23:55.500 --> 23:57.500
And you've had the soles
of your shoes replaced.

23:57.500 --> 23:59.100
One might think
you're frugal, but in fact,

23:59.100 --> 24:01.100
You're having
financial difficulties.

24:01.500 --> 24:02.300
You wear a fake rolex

24:02.300 --> 24:03.900
Because you pawned your real one
to pay your debts.

24:03.900 --> 24:05.600
My guess is to a bookie.

24:06.100 --> 24:07.800
I took this case pro bono.

24:08.400 --> 24:10.800
I am one of the most
successful criminal attorneys

24:10.800 --> 24:11.800
In the state.

24:11.800 --> 24:13.300
Your vice is horses.

24:13.500 --> 24:16.000
Your blackberry's been buzzing
on the table every 20 minutes,

24:16.000 --> 24:19.500
Which happens to be the average time
between posts from colonial downs.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.000
You're getting race results.

24:21.700 --> 24:23.800
And every time you do,
it affects your mood in court,

24:23.800 --> 24:25.800
And you're not having
a very good day.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
That's because you pick horses
the same way you practice law-

24:29.500 --> 24:31.200
By always taking the long shot.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.900
Well, you spin
a very good yarn, agent,

24:35.900 --> 24:38.400
But as usual,
you've proven nothing.

24:39.400 --> 24:41.200
If i'm not mistaken,
the results from the fifth race

24:41.200 --> 24:43.000
Should be coming through
any minute.

24:49.200 --> 24:51.400
Why don't you tell us
if your luck has changed?

24:53.300 --> 24:54.100
Your honor, this is-

24:54.100 --> 24:55.300
What do you want me to do?

24:56.000 --> 24:58.800
Either show us your blackberry
or cut him loose, counselor.

25:05.800 --> 25:06.600
Nothing further.

25:06.600 --> 25:09.300
Wise decision.
Court will be adjourned

25:09.300 --> 25:11.000
Until 9 a.M. Tomorrow.

25:16.900 --> 25:17.800
Mr. Corbett.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.400
Hey, uh, i just wanted
to make sure you knew

25:20.400 --> 25:22.800
That cross-Examination
wasn't as bad as it sounded.

25:23.300 --> 25:24.500
I'm not worried.

25:24.600 --> 25:25.300
Oh.

25:25.300 --> 25:26.400
Good.

25:26.700 --> 25:28.900
I have a better
understanding of things now.

25:29.100 --> 25:30.200
Understanding?

25:30.400 --> 25:33.000
After darci died, i started
to see a therapist.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.100
Had a lot of guilt,
you know.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.200
Thought that i should
have been there for her,

25:37.200 --> 25:39.000
Saved her somehow,
i don't know.

25:39.400 --> 25:41.200
This guy, this shrink,

25:42.000 --> 25:43.700
He always brought it back
to control.

25:44.600 --> 25:46.000
He said i had to
accept the fact

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
That there were always
gonna be things in life

25:48.400 --> 25:49.900
I couldn't control.

25:50.300 --> 25:51.600
I think that's wise.

25:52.500 --> 25:56.000
I realize i have no say over
what goes on in that courtroom.

25:58.300 --> 25:59.700
See you later, spencer.

26:40.700 --> 26:41.500
Nina moore?

26:41.600 --> 26:42.600
Yes.

26:42.700 --> 26:43.800
We're with the fbi.

26:46.500 --> 26:47.500
Come in.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.800
Why didn't you
come forward?

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
I was protecting
my family.

26:56.300 --> 26:57.300
They don't know?

26:59.600 --> 27:01.200
I was a kid myself.

27:01.800 --> 27:03.300
You give away a child...

27:04.000 --> 27:05.500
I know it sounds cold,

27:05.500 --> 27:07.700
But you just want
to forget about it,

27:07.700 --> 27:09.200
Believe it never happened.

27:09.200 --> 27:11.500
So that's how i lived.

27:11.800 --> 27:14.100
But you maintained
a relationship with brian.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.200
Maintained? No.

27:15.200 --> 27:18.600
I only saw him once
before the accident.

27:18.600 --> 27:21.200
You never got the sense
that maybe he was...

27:21.200 --> 27:24.100
A murderer?
Not in the slightest.

27:24.100 --> 27:25.600
I think was probably-

27:25.600 --> 27:28.500
Well-I mean, from what
i understand in the news,

27:28.800 --> 27:30.900
We met before it started.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.600
And when was that meeting?

27:32.600 --> 27:33.800
5 years ago.

27:34.200 --> 27:36.500
He just called me
out of the blue.

27:36.900 --> 27:39.100
The records were
supposed to be sealed.

27:39.700 --> 27:41.900
I think he hired someone
to find me.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.400
And what did you
talk about?

27:43.700 --> 27:46.500
He was interested
in my family,

27:47.200 --> 27:48.200
My kids.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.600
He just wanted to...

27:52.000 --> 27:53.800
Call every once
in a while,

27:54.200 --> 27:56.300
Maybe meet
around the holidays.

27:56.600 --> 27:57.700
But i couldn't.

27:58.200 --> 28:00.700
I could barely bring myself
to look at him.

28:00.700 --> 28:01.800
I just...

28:03.300 --> 28:04.500
You rejected him.

28:05.800 --> 28:08.700
Whatever he became,
i can't help but feel it...

28:09.400 --> 28:10.600
It's my fault.

28:11.700 --> 28:13.900
You can't blame yourself
for what he did.

28:14.900 --> 28:17.200
Why did you visit him
at the hospital?

28:19.600 --> 28:22.100
Because it was safe,
i suppose.

28:22.600 --> 28:25.700
I could be there for him
and no one had to know.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.900
And because when i would
read to him

28:29.300 --> 28:30.800
And listen to his breathing...

28:34.000 --> 28:35.100
It felt right.

28:35.200 --> 28:38.200
Hey, whose car
is that out there?

28:38.200 --> 28:40.900
The-Oh. Hello.

28:41.600 --> 28:42.800
Who's this?

28:42.900 --> 28:44.000
Excuse me.

28:48.600 --> 28:50.400
That's a lot to explain.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.000
She rejected him.

28:52.500 --> 28:53.800
That was the stressor.

28:53.900 --> 28:56.100
She's just lucky
he took no for an answer.

28:56.300 --> 28:58.400
It could have been a lot
worse if he pressed the issue.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.900
Maybe he did.

29:05.900 --> 29:06.900
Mrs. Moore.

29:07.900 --> 29:11.000
Did he ever send you
anything? Any gifts?

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
I wanted
to throw them away, but...

29:19.600 --> 29:20.600
I couldn't.

29:40.300 --> 29:42.100
Please. Please.

29:43.700 --> 29:44.900
Oh.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.100
You ok?

29:47.300 --> 29:49.100
Yeah. It's just, uh...

29:51.300 --> 29:52.500
I didn't sleep last night.

29:56.500 --> 29:58.500
I'm not supposed to do this,
but, um...

30:00.700 --> 30:01.600
I brought something.

30:04.500 --> 30:06.500
You want to know
if you like popcorn, right?

30:20.600 --> 30:21.400
So, uh...

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
You remember?

30:25.500 --> 30:27.100
I think i'm starting to.

30:57.200 --> 30:58.900
???

30:58.900 --> 31:00.100
Think about what this would do

31:00.100 --> 31:01.300
Think about ???

31:01.300 --> 31:02.500
I am thinking about her.

31:02.500 --> 31:04.000
If she knew
what you were about to do,

31:04.000 --> 31:06.100
And depending on your belief
system, maybe she does,

31:06.100 --> 31:07.400
Do you think
she'd want this?

31:07.700 --> 31:08.500
Give me the gun.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.200
You want him to suffer,
but he'll be dead.

31:10.200 --> 31:11.900
He won't feel anything,
you'll be in prison,

31:11.900 --> 31:13.700
And you will regret it,
believe me.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.100
I'm already in prison.

31:24.700 --> 31:25.700
How did you know?

31:26.300 --> 31:28.000
Your affect, your behavior.

31:28.500 --> 31:31.000
You were too calm yesterday, and
you called me by my first name.

31:32.300 --> 31:33.400
If you're so good
at predicting things,

31:33.400 --> 31:35.900
How come you couldn't stop
him before he took my darci?

31:38.300 --> 31:40.200
Look, i shouldn't
say anything, but...

31:40.800 --> 31:42.000
There's some new evidence.

31:43.500 --> 31:44.700
What evidence?

31:45.000 --> 31:46.800
My name is nina moore.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.600
And what is your
relationship to the defendant?

31:49.900 --> 31:51.300
I'm his birth mother.

31:51.300 --> 31:53.000
His biological mother.

31:53.400 --> 31:56.300
I gave him up for adoption
when he was a baby.

31:56.500 --> 31:58.100
And that was how long ago?

31:58.400 --> 31:59.700
37 years.

31:59.700 --> 32:02.100
So you didn't have
a relationship with him?

32:02.700 --> 32:05.900
No. I never saw him
until 2003.

32:05.900 --> 32:07.300
He tracked you down?

32:07.600 --> 32:08.400
Yes.

32:09.300 --> 32:10.500
We met at a cafe

32:10.500 --> 32:13.000
And talked for a bit,
and then he left.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.400
And what did you
talk about?

32:15.300 --> 32:17.800
He said he wanted
to be a part of my life.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.500
I told him it was impossible.

32:19.700 --> 32:21.300
You felt that
he was being...

32:22.500 --> 32:23.700
Unrealistic,

32:23.700 --> 32:24.900
Irrational even?

32:24.900 --> 32:26.300
No, not at all.

32:26.300 --> 32:28.800
He was just a little lost.

32:28.900 --> 32:31.100
He wanted to belong
to something.

32:32.400 --> 32:34.500
Turning him away
was one of the hardest things

32:34.500 --> 32:36.100
I've ever had to do.

32:36.200 --> 32:39.100
A person can't live
two lives.

32:39.800 --> 32:42.300
I'm sorry, brian.
I'm so sorry.

32:42.300 --> 32:43.900
Mrs. Moore,
did the defendant

32:43.900 --> 32:46.900
Make any subsequent attempts
to communicate with you?

32:47.000 --> 32:49.300
A few months after that,

32:49.800 --> 32:51.300
I got something in the mail.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.800
There was no note or anything,

32:53.800 --> 32:56.000
Just a postmark from roanoke,

32:56.000 --> 32:57.700
And i knew
that's where he lived.

32:57.700 --> 32:59.900
And what were the contents
of the envelope?

32:59.900 --> 33:01.600
It was a necklace.

33:02.500 --> 33:04.300
2 months after that
i got another.

33:04.800 --> 33:06.100
And then a watch.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.400
I thought he was trying to...

33:09.000 --> 33:10.500
I- I don't know,

33:10.500 --> 33:13.200
Just persuade me with gifts.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.100
I thought they were
estate jewelry.

33:15.100 --> 33:17.600
Your honor, i'd like
to enter into evidence

33:17.600 --> 33:21.300
People's exhibit "f"
through "h."

33:23.100 --> 33:25.500
Are these the items that
you received in the mail?

33:26.700 --> 33:27.600
Yes.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.100
And the watch
in this bag-

33:29.300 --> 33:30.700
Do you see it
in this photograph?

33:32.400 --> 33:33.500
Yes, that's it.

33:33.500 --> 33:36.200
Let the record reflect
the witness has identified

33:36.200 --> 33:38.800
The watch
worn in this photograph

33:38.900 --> 33:41.000
By murder victim
darci corbett.

33:43.900 --> 33:45.200
I have nothing further.

33:48.300 --> 33:50.400
Court is adjourned
until 9 a.M. Tomorrow,

33:50.400 --> 33:51.600
Back for cross.

34:14.500 --> 34:15.900
Rough day
in there, huh?

34:28.900 --> 34:30.000
Cece, i need
to talk to you.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.400
Hey. Listen, i don't want
to jinx this,

34:32.400 --> 34:34.699
But something tells me i'm going to
be buying your team a round of drinks

34:34.699 --> 34:35.699
When this is over.

34:35.699 --> 34:37.500
I think he's getting
his memory back.

34:38.100 --> 34:39.900
I'll get you undone
so you can change.

34:43.900 --> 34:45.100
You ok?

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
A lot on my mind.

34:47.900 --> 34:50.199
He was crying in there, when
his mother was on the stand.

34:51.199 --> 34:53.600
And you don't have that kind of
reaction unless you're connected.

34:54.500 --> 34:55.900
You been watching
the trial?

34:57.600 --> 34:58.700
Most of it, yeah.

35:00.400 --> 35:03.300
Today when my mother talked
about having to choose one life...

35:04.500 --> 35:06.000
Do you believe that's true?

35:13.000 --> 35:15.100
Don't you think
you'd have to choose?

35:18.700 --> 35:20.000
Maybe you're right, but...

35:20.700 --> 35:22.700
The fact is it doesn't
really matter anymore.

35:22.700 --> 35:25.200
Doesn't it? I mean, don't you want
to know who you're putting away?

35:26.000 --> 35:26.900
Heading over there now.

35:27.600 --> 35:28.600
Stand back, people.

35:29.800 --> 35:30.600
What's going on?

35:33.500 --> 35:34.300
Excuse me.

35:37.100 --> 35:38.300
Are you ok?

35:39.700 --> 35:40.600
What happened?

35:41.300 --> 35:42.600
He has my gun.

35:46.200 --> 35:47.200
She's a law clerk.

35:47.200 --> 35:48.600
Matloff stuck a gun
in her face,

35:48.600 --> 35:50.800
Pulled her out of her car,
late model nissan.

35:50.800 --> 35:51.900
And you put out an apb?

35:51.900 --> 35:53.900
Statewide. We'll block
every road out of town.

35:53.900 --> 35:55.900
Don't forget service roads.
He knows them all.

35:56.100 --> 35:56.900
You know this guy, right?

35:56.900 --> 35:58.500
Any idea
where he might be headed?

35:58.500 --> 35:59.800
All depends on who he is.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.000
Hey. Hey!

36:02.100 --> 36:02.800
Did you know?

36:03.700 --> 36:05.400
- Know what?
- You talked to matloff every day.

36:05.400 --> 36:07.100
Did you know that his
memory was coming back?

36:07.100 --> 36:08.600
I don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.700
He can't help us. Matloff
is a paranoid personality.

36:10.700 --> 36:12.600
Even if he was aware
he wouldn't have told anyone.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.000
Get over to the jail
and into his cell.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.900
Just look for anything, any clue
that might tell us where he's headed.

36:22.800 --> 36:25.100
Assuming his memory is coming
back, where's he headed?

36:25.100 --> 36:26.700
Simple answer's
his birth mother.

36:27.200 --> 36:28.300
His victims were brunettes.

36:28.700 --> 36:30.700
Typology suggests that
he was projecting rage at her.

36:30.700 --> 36:32.800
That's not an option.
She's with us, protected.

36:32.800 --> 36:34.600
If he doesn't have
a specific target,

36:34.600 --> 36:37.200
He'll either run
or go on a spree.

36:38.100 --> 36:39.100
Did we do this?

36:39.600 --> 36:41.900
The brain test? Reintroducing
all those memories?

36:41.900 --> 36:43.400
Is it possible
that it could have acted

36:43.400 --> 36:45.500
As a cognitive
rehabilitation?

36:46.000 --> 36:47.100
This guy is who he is.

36:47.300 --> 36:48.700
That's got nothing
to do with us.

37:21.300 --> 37:22.900
Hotch, i think i know
where he's going.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Any sign of him?

38:14.100 --> 38:16.000
He's got about a half-Hour
head start on us.

38:16.200 --> 38:18.100
There's a waterfall
near the site

38:18.100 --> 38:19.800
Where we found
darci corbett's body.

38:19.800 --> 38:20.900
Yeah, that's linville falls.

38:20.900 --> 38:22.000
That's where we need to go.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.800
Figured this guy would have
headed straight out of town.

38:23.800 --> 38:24.900
Why'd he come back here?

38:24.900 --> 38:25.900
He's looking for something.

38:26.000 --> 38:26.700
For what?

38:27.300 --> 38:28.400
Himself.

38:42.700 --> 38:44.500
That's him. Glasses.

38:47.400 --> 38:48.200
It's him.

38:48.400 --> 38:50.400
He's got a girl with him
and she's not moving.

38:50.900 --> 38:51.900
All right, let's move in.

38:51.900 --> 38:53.200
No, wait.
If we rush him,

38:53.200 --> 38:55.600
He might try to kill her and himself.

38:55.900 --> 38:56.800
How do you want to do this?

38:57.100 --> 38:58.400
I want to go in there
myself.

38:58.500 --> 38:59.900
Get your shooters
high and wide.

39:00.200 --> 39:01.500
Think he's gonna
shoot his way out?

39:01.500 --> 39:03.500
Well, i don't want to be the
only gun in there if he does.

39:09.500 --> 39:10.600
Please.

39:12.800 --> 39:13.700
Brian.

39:14.800 --> 39:16.400
I want you
to show me your hands.

39:19.000 --> 39:19.900
Hands, brian!

39:19.900 --> 39:23.100
Stop! Stop there, please.

39:27.100 --> 39:28.100
Who is she?

39:30.500 --> 39:32.000
She was my first.

39:34.400 --> 39:36.300
The minute my feet
hit the ground,

39:37.100 --> 39:38.700
I knew right where
to find her.

39:41.500 --> 39:42.500
I killed them.

39:43.700 --> 39:44.700
You remember.

39:46.800 --> 39:47.800
Everything.

39:49.700 --> 39:51.000
Every moment.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.100
Every...

39:54.500 --> 39:55.800
Tiny detail.

39:57.100 --> 39:59.100
I remember. But...

40:01.300 --> 40:02.700
It's still not real.

40:04.800 --> 40:05.400
It's like...

40:07.100 --> 40:09.000
The memories belong
to someone else.

40:09.100 --> 40:10.500
Well, maybe in a way
they do.

40:11.900 --> 40:13.700
But you still have to pay
for what's been done.

40:16.800 --> 40:18.100
If i'm gonna be put to death,

40:18.100 --> 40:19.600
I might as well die
right here.

40:19.600 --> 40:20.700
Brian.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.600
The court
may show you mercy,

40:22.800 --> 40:24.000
But you have to earn it.

40:24.600 --> 40:27.100
If you believe you're a
different person, then prove it

40:27.100 --> 40:28.700
And do the right thing.

40:54.700 --> 40:55.700
It's over.

40:56.500 --> 40:57.900
Matloff's pleading out.

40:58.200 --> 40:59.300
Congratulations.

40:59.800 --> 41:01.400
I couldn't have done it
without you.

41:01.800 --> 41:02.800
First round's on me.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.300
No, we're gonna take a rain
check. We got a long drive.

41:05.400 --> 41:06.200
Sure.

41:07.000 --> 41:07.900
Another time.

41:10.200 --> 41:12.100
- Lock up when you leave.
- We will.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
Darci corbett's father brought
a gun to the courthouse today.

41:18.300 --> 41:19.200
You're kidding.

41:20.200 --> 41:21.700
You think he was serious
about using it?

41:22.200 --> 41:23.300
I think so, yeah.

41:23.400 --> 41:25.000
He was looking
for closure.

41:26.700 --> 41:28.200
You think
he'll get some now?

41:28.600 --> 41:30.000
I don't really think so.
I mean,

41:30.100 --> 41:32.600
People's emotional lives
aren't linear like that.

41:32.600 --> 41:35.700
To say that a killer's
conviction, one single event

41:35.700 --> 41:37.700
Can just suddenly
bring peace to a man,

41:37.700 --> 41:40.400
I don't-I just don't
think it's possible.

41:41.400 --> 41:42.400
Well, i guess he has to try.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.500
I mean, when it comes
right down to it,

41:43.500 --> 41:44.800
What choice does he have?

41:50.500 --> 41:51.400
Agent reid.

41:51.800 --> 41:54.000
Sorry, i, uh,
i know it's late,

41:54.100 --> 41:56.100
But, um, i wanted
to give you the news

41:56.100 --> 41:57.400
Before it hit the paper.

41:58.300 --> 42:00.200
Matloff's changing
his plea to guilty.

42:00.600 --> 42:03.100
Everyone agreed
to life without parole.

42:05.200 --> 42:06.600
You didn't have to come here.

42:07.800 --> 42:09.600
I also came to return this.

42:11.600 --> 42:13.200
I had them release it
from evidence.

42:13.500 --> 42:15.200
It belonged
to darci's grandmother.

42:16.800 --> 42:18.400
They were very close.

42:18.500 --> 42:20.500
I couldn't help but notice
the inscription on the back.

42:21.300 --> 42:22.700
"Glory in a flower"?

42:23.000 --> 42:24.700
I'm not familiar.

42:25.500 --> 42:27.300
Poetry was something
they shared.

42:27.700 --> 42:28.700
It's wordsworth.

42:30.400 --> 42:33.200
"What though the radiance
that was once so bright

42:34.100 --> 42:37.200
"Be now forever taken
from my sight...

42:39.100 --> 42:40.200
"Though nothing can...

42:42.400 --> 42:43.400
Bring back... "

42:54.000 --> 42:55.100
Thanks.

42:59.500 --> 43:00.900
"Though nothing
can bring back

43:00.900 --> 43:02.900
"The hour of splendor
in the grass,

43:02.900 --> 43:04.700
"Of glory in the flower,

43:04.700 --> 43:05.900
"We will grieve not,

43:06.100 --> 43:07.500
"Rather find strength

43:07.500 --> 43:09.400
In what remains behind."
