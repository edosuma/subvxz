02:14.168 --> 02:15.501
A-ha!

02:26.847 --> 02:28.814
Huh?

02:44.665 --> 02:46.698
Hmm?

02:49.203 --> 02:51.803
Ooh!

03:21.235 --> 03:22.534
Whoa!

03:26.807 --> 03:30.609
Ah, man,
there's none left for me.

03:34.215 --> 03:35.781
What was that?

03:36.550 --> 03:37.816
Talking?

03:37.818 --> 03:39.785
I can't talk!

03:39.787 --> 03:43.422
Words?

03:43.424 --> 03:46.458
Ouch.

03:46.460 --> 03:49.928
Ouch? What is an "ouch"?

03:49.930 --> 03:52.931
A word. What's a word?

03:52.933 --> 03:55.634
This. This is a word.

03:55.636 --> 03:59.004
I'm talking! I'm talking!
I can talk!

03:59.006 --> 04:02.708
This is amazing!
Oooh, nice word.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.409
Amazing.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.745
Ah-may-zing!

04:06.747 --> 04:09.481
I think that's
my favourite word so far.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.850
Amazing. Amazing.

04:11.852 --> 04:14.253
Amazing. Amazing.

04:14.255 --> 04:16.387
Amazing. Amazing. Amazing.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.457
Amazing. Amazing. Amazing.

04:18.459 --> 04:21.426
Wait! Now it's sounding weird.
Amazing.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.929
Is that right?
Doesn't sound right.

04:23.931 --> 04:28.734
Ama... Ooh, tree.
Ooh, I love you, tree.

04:28.736 --> 04:31.703
Stone. Leaf.
Branch. Ground.

04:31.705 --> 04:34.473
Foot. Root. Vine. Hands.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.708
Fingers. Tail. Nose. Elbow.

04:36.710 --> 04:39.578
That's a good word.
Amazing's better.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.913
- Excuse me.
- Talking elephant!

04:41.915 --> 04:43.849
- Where?
- You!

04:43.851 --> 04:45.984
- What?
- Talking elephant!

04:45.986 --> 04:49.988
Me, talking? Talking elephant!
I can talk?

04:49.990 --> 04:53.892
Thank you for the bananas
earlier. They were delicious.

04:53.894 --> 04:56.662
I can make compliments.
What's going on?

04:56.664 --> 04:58.797
I don't know,
but isn't it great?

04:58.799 --> 05:03.302
Or, as I like to say, cos I
can say stuff now, amazing?

05:03.304 --> 05:05.337
Have we been able to talk
this whole time?

05:05.339 --> 05:07.906
That would've saved a lot
of grunting and pointing.

05:07.908 --> 05:10.475
- Like, a lot!
- Shh!

05:10.477 --> 05:11.943
What?

05:16.083 --> 05:19.484
- You hear that?
- What?

05:29.697 --> 05:31.863
- What is it?
- Shh.

05:34.635 --> 05:35.934
What?

05:45.079 --> 05:48.080
- What do you hear?
- That bush is crying.

05:48.082 --> 05:51.583
- I'm not a bush.
- Talking bush!

05:51.585 --> 05:54.086
I said, I'm not a bush.

05:54.088 --> 05:56.755
- Shrub, then? Talking shrub?
- No.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.357
- Hedge?
- No!

05:58.359 --> 06:02.027
<i>Fruticumque viret?</i>
I can speak Latin!

06:02.029 --> 06:05.397
What's Latin?

06:05.399 --> 06:07.933
OK, we're sorry.
What are you then?

06:07.935 --> 06:11.036
I can't tell you.
You'll freak out.

06:11.038 --> 06:14.740
- No.
- We really won't.

06:14.742 --> 06:17.809
You sound all alone and sad.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.711
Is this your, uh...

06:19.713 --> 06:23.081
I feel like this would be
your shoulder, or...

06:23.083 --> 06:24.616
Whoops.

06:24.618 --> 06:28.520
Oh, please come out.
It's nice out here.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.789
We've got, um, uh, oh...

06:30.791 --> 06:35.026
the sky and, oh, the ground.

06:36.397 --> 06:38.630
OK.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.866
Can't stay in this <i>fruticumque
viret</i> forever, I suppose.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.968
As much as I'd like to.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.812
Told you you'd freak out.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.982
What?

06:56.984 --> 06:59.484
No...

07:10.998 --> 07:13.198
So, why were you crying?

07:13.200 --> 07:16.468
Is it because you're, like,
really super freaky?

07:16.470 --> 07:18.437
What did I say?

07:18.439 --> 07:21.006
- Is it, though?
- No. It's just...

07:21.008 --> 07:23.542
Have you heard of
the word "alien"?

07:23.544 --> 07:27.012
We hadn't heard any words
until, like, five minutes ago.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.647
Well, you see,

07:29.649 --> 07:31.649
- I come from very far away.
- The sky?

07:31.652 --> 07:35.754
- All I want is to go home.
- Oh, that's easy!

07:35.756 --> 07:38.190
What? Hey, no!

07:48.635 --> 07:52.537
- What did you do that for?
- You said you wanted to go home.

07:52.539 --> 07:56.041
Yeah. OK. It takes
a lot more than that

07:56.043 --> 07:59.511
- to exit the Earth's atmosphere.
- Gotcha!

07:59.513 --> 08:02.147
- I have the regret...
- No.

08:04.017 --> 08:09.521
- He seemed nice.
- I wonder what he...

08:09.523 --> 08:12.557
What's tha...

08:17.130 --> 08:20.799
Um, look,
I don't mean to cause a fuss.

08:20.801 --> 08:23.268
- Would you mind not doing that?
- Sorry.

08:23.270 --> 08:27.072
Hey, we can talk again.
You're making us talk!

08:27.074 --> 08:30.208
It's not me. Hang on, just...
Where's that...?

08:30.210 --> 08:32.544
Ah, there we go.

08:32.546 --> 08:34.746
If you're anywhere near this,
then...

08:34.748 --> 08:37.215
- What is that?
- It's a speech pod.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.618
Oh, I love peaches!

08:39.620 --> 08:41.753
Not peach.

08:41.755 --> 08:44.022
Ssp-p-p... speech.

08:44.024 --> 08:47.959
- This makes us talk?
- Yes.

08:47.961 --> 08:51.029
- Could I have...?
- This is amazing!

08:51.031 --> 08:53.164
- That's my favourite word.
- Nice.

08:53.166 --> 08:57.269
The others have got to try this!

08:57.871 --> 09:00.739
Oh, boy.

09:06.146 --> 09:10.315
Just wait
till I get my paws on you.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.751
You'll wish you'd never ripened!

09:12.753 --> 09:14.085
Huh?

09:14.087 --> 09:16.121
Get off my lawn! Get off!

09:16.123 --> 09:20.025
Off, off, off, off, off, off,
off, off, off, off!

09:20.027 --> 09:23.562
Huh!

09:23.564 --> 09:24.963
And, you! Get off my back,

09:24.965 --> 09:29.267
you yellow-bellied
delicious tropical tormentor!

09:29.269 --> 09:31.336
Who's there?

09:31.338 --> 09:33.705
- Egg.
- Egg who?

09:33.707 --> 09:37.309
No. Just Egg. Why?
Is there other stuff out there

09:37.311 --> 09:40.579
- I don't know about?
- Who knows?

09:40.581 --> 09:44.749
- I want out!
- Uh-uh-uh. Not yet, dears.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.319
Too soon for you.

09:47.321 --> 09:51.323
Ball. Ball, ball, ball, ball,
ball, ball, ball.

09:51.325 --> 09:56.261
Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.631
Huh? Ball?

10:03.637 --> 10:08.073
Come on.

10:08.075 --> 10:11.109
Say something. Just a word.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.313
Huh?

10:15.315 --> 10:19.651
- Huh?
- Oh.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.119
Hey?

10:21.121 --> 10:25.223
Oh, coming. I'm coming.

10:27.394 --> 10:30.027
I'm sorry.

10:30.029 --> 10:32.663
No, that's quite all right.
I'm used to this sort of thing.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.670
Huh?!

10:40.674 --> 10:42.707
Hey, who are you? What are you?

10:42.709 --> 10:45.310
What are you doing here?
You're a newcomer.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.312
- Do you know the rules?
- Rules?

10:47.314 --> 10:51.383
When you're in this jungle,
you need to know the rules.

10:51.385 --> 10:54.252
Rule 1: stay off my lawn!

10:54.254 --> 10:56.988
Rule 3: don't ever, ever...

10:56.990 --> 10:59.057
What happened to rule 2?

10:59.059 --> 11:00.291
...ever correct me!

11:00.293 --> 11:03.795
Rule 4: I'm right, you're wrong.
Rule next...

11:03.797 --> 11:07.198
You don't need to tell me this.
I'm trying to go home.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.934
- Huh?
- He's from the sky.

11:09.936 --> 11:12.737
Well, no...
a bit further than that.

11:12.739 --> 11:17.208
I come from...
Please don't throw me again.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.811
I come from a planet
called Scaldron.

11:19.813 --> 11:23.181
It's another world
far beyond the stars.

11:26.853 --> 11:29.187
Oooh!

11:29.189 --> 11:31.522
Ooh.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.858
But I'm not allowed to go back
until I complete my mission.

11:33.860 --> 11:38.730
A mission! That sounds
A to the may to the zing!

11:38.732 --> 11:41.800
Favourite word. I'm allowed
to do stuff like that to it.

11:41.802 --> 11:44.169
What's your mission?

11:47.074 --> 11:48.907
I'd rather not talk about it.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.942
- But we can help!
- Yeah.

11:50.944 --> 11:54.813
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I'm not helping anyone

11:54.815 --> 11:57.115
unless there's something
in it for me.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.384
Honestly,
you don't have to help.

11:59.386 --> 12:02.487
Ah, no, no, no. Nice try.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.122
You can't leave me out of this!

12:04.124 --> 12:06.458
I'm helping and that's final!

12:06.460 --> 12:08.827
It's something
I have to do myself.

12:08.829 --> 12:13.431
So, if it's all the same to you,
I'd really rather be alone.

12:38.759 --> 12:43.294
You're still there, aren't you?

12:43.296 --> 12:46.030
You look like
you could use some company.

12:46.032 --> 12:47.899
It's very lonely, being alone.

12:47.901 --> 12:50.001
We'll stay with you
until you feel better.

12:50.003 --> 12:52.537
I don't need help.
I'm a Scaldronian.

12:52.539 --> 12:55.240
- Scaldronians don't need help!
- Loud words!

12:55.242 --> 12:58.510
- That's upsetting me.
- Sorry, I didn't mean to shout.

12:58.512 --> 13:00.378
Don't worry, he's always upset.

13:00.380 --> 13:03.548
I <i>am</i> always upset!
Don't you say I am.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.116
- What?
- You see?

13:05.118 --> 13:07.919
- I have no idea what you mean.
- Exactly!

13:07.921 --> 13:12.323
What I mean to say is
it's very kind, thank you,

13:12.325 --> 13:14.025
but you can't help me,

13:14.027 --> 13:18.129
and you wouldn't even like it
if you did.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.498
But if you don't complete
your mission...

13:20.500 --> 13:22.433
You can't go home.

13:22.435 --> 13:25.336
And if you can't go home,
you won't...

13:25.338 --> 13:28.339
See your family.

13:30.310 --> 13:35.246
Poor alien.

13:35.248 --> 13:38.983
Can't go back home.

13:45.492 --> 13:50.094
Oh, come now.
There, there. Chin up.

13:50.096 --> 13:54.465
But you can't go home,
and it's so far away.

13:54.467 --> 13:59.470
And we can't help you.
And what about your friends?

13:59.472 --> 14:02.540
- Oh, that's not a problem.
- Huh?

14:02.542 --> 14:08.279
I don't have any friends.

14:08.281 --> 14:12.150
Look, it's not...
Oh, boy. Please don't cry.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.853
OK, fine.

14:14.855 --> 14:20.058
I'll do it. I'll give it a go.

14:20.060 --> 14:23.027
- Your mission?
- Yep. Why not?

14:23.029 --> 14:25.463
If it'll stop all the,
you know...

14:25.465 --> 14:27.198
...stuff.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.167
Yes!

14:29.169 --> 14:33.538
OK. Well, I guess this is it,
then. The, um, moment.

14:39.579 --> 14:42.881
I...

14:45.218 --> 14:49.921
Uh, hang on. Hold on a sec.
Let me just, uh...

14:54.361 --> 14:58.196
Yeah, that makes sense, yeah.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.598
OK. Yeah.

15:06.072 --> 15:08.606
Hm...
OK then, sorry about that.

15:08.608 --> 15:11.309
Uh...
I claim this planet

15:11.311 --> 15:14.379
in the name
of the mighty people of...

15:14.381 --> 15:18.216
- Hey!
- Mmm.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.086
Oh, great.

15:22.088 --> 15:25.456
Freedom!

15:25.458 --> 15:29.027
Look out, coming through!
Terribly sorry.

15:29.029 --> 15:32.297
- Come back here, young lady.
- Ah, man.

15:34.534 --> 15:37.135
- Carry on.
- Yeah, go on.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.037
But... he took my...

15:39.039 --> 15:42.507
Don't worry about that.
You can do it. Right, guys?

15:42.509 --> 15:45.576
You can do anything
you set your mind to.

15:45.578 --> 15:49.414
- I set my mind to freedom.
- Not you.

15:49.416 --> 15:53.017
- Oh.
- Uh-oh.

15:53.019 --> 15:56.054
Uh... Um... Uh...

15:56.056 --> 15:59.657
I claim this planet...

15:59.659 --> 16:03.127
...in the name of the mighty
people of Scaldron!

16:03.129 --> 16:06.230
Surrender peacefully
or meet the wrath...

16:06.232 --> 16:08.715
Is it wrath, wrath...?

16:08.717 --> 16:11.201
...the wrath of the mighty
people of Scaldron!

16:11.204 --> 16:13.438
Uh, that's...
that's a bit repetitive.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.374
Should probably rewrite that.
And, uh...

16:16.376 --> 16:21.012
Um, there, there you have it.
That's my big, uh...

16:21.014 --> 16:22.380
The end.

16:24.217 --> 16:28.119
- We surrender peacefully!
- You... You do?

16:28.121 --> 16:30.021
Wait just one second.

16:30.023 --> 16:32.991
I for one
do <i>not</i> surrender peacefully.

16:32.993 --> 16:36.694
- You really don't have to...
- I surrender peacefully.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.296
- You did it!
- I did?

16:38.298 --> 16:42.433
Yeah, well done!

16:42.435 --> 16:44.785
Whoopee.

16:44.787 --> 16:47.138
I did it.
I... I conquered a planet.

16:47.140 --> 16:50.241
Huh?

16:58.685 --> 17:00.418
Hmm!

17:05.692 --> 17:08.159
Huh?

17:10.597 --> 17:12.797
So, now what?

17:12.799 --> 17:15.500
Um...

17:15.502 --> 17:20.338
Right. Well, usually,
when a planet is conquered,

17:20.339 --> 17:25.309
um, there's like pandemonium
and chaos all around.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.614
Uh, so I guess,

17:29.616 --> 17:34.719
as your new leader, my first job
would be to bring, uh...

17:35.422 --> 17:37.121
...peace.

17:45.665 --> 17:49.467
Here's our chance.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.702
- Yeah!
- Let's go!

17:51.704 --> 17:56.240
I don't know what
we're doing, but I'm excited!

17:59.479 --> 18:02.780
Now, guys, remember, peace.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.816
- Yeah!
- Oh, dear.

18:30.276 --> 18:33.277
Oh!

18:33.279 --> 18:36.681
Not so fun, is it?

18:36.683 --> 18:41.385
You're not very good at this,
are you?

18:41.387 --> 18:44.355
Time to run away!

18:45.792 --> 18:47.558
What?

18:47.560 --> 18:51.295
As ruler of this planet,

18:51.297 --> 18:52.830
I order you to...

18:52.832 --> 18:55.900
- Why did you do that?
- I saved your life.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.168
Why?

18:57.170 --> 18:59.604
You have to be alive
to get home.

18:59.606 --> 19:01.555
Well, yes, but...

19:01.557 --> 19:03.507
Somehow it feels like
now is not the best time

19:03.510 --> 19:05.877
to be having this conversation.

19:06.880 --> 19:11.315
Whoa! Boost! Bo-o-ost!

19:12.919 --> 19:17.288
Rhino power!

19:25.565 --> 19:26.631
Huh?

19:39.712 --> 19:43.714
Hey. Wait.
No, d... no, don't!

19:56.896 --> 20:00.364
I'm terribly sorry
about all of this.

20:00.366 --> 20:03.501
Oh, this? This is pretty normal
around here.

20:03.503 --> 20:06.804
Normal? You call this normal?

20:06.806 --> 20:08.873
Look here, Jelly Boy.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.642
I do have a name. I'm Fneep.

20:11.644 --> 20:12.677
What's your name?

20:12.679 --> 20:13.778
Ah, humph!

20:13.780 --> 20:16.681
Humph, huh?
Pleased to meet you, Humph.

20:16.683 --> 20:19.550
- Humph?
- Oh, my turn!

20:19.552 --> 20:22.420
- I want a name.
- Uh, OK.

20:22.422 --> 20:25.323
Um, well,
you've got a trunk, and...

20:25.325 --> 20:28.326
Trunk! I love it!

20:28.328 --> 20:30.795
Oh, uh, wow. Um, OK then.

20:30.797 --> 20:33.564
Not quite where I was going,
but, yeah.

20:33.566 --> 20:36.400
- Hi, my name is Trunk.
- Yes...

20:36.402 --> 20:39.337
Hello! Trunk here.

20:39.339 --> 20:44.008
Hey, there. Trunk.

20:44.010 --> 20:48.346
- Oh! Me! Me! Do me next.
- Fluffy Bum!

20:50.250 --> 20:53.551
- Fluffy Bum!
- No, that can't be your name.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.953
- Banana Breath.
- Ooh, I do like bananas.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.989
- No!
- Ear Face.

20:57.991 --> 21:00.324
- Ear Face?
- Nose Boy.

21:00.326 --> 21:03.294
- No!
- Munkiii...

21:03.296 --> 21:06.397
- Yes, Munki.
- I wasn't finished.

21:06.399 --> 21:08.833
Munki.

21:08.835 --> 21:12.770
- Pleased to meet you, Munki.
- And I'm Trunk, by the way.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.773
Yes, Trunk,
pleased to meet you too.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.577
And what about you?

21:19.579 --> 21:23.581
My name is Rockford Haberdashery
Pleasant the Third.

21:23.583 --> 21:26.384
But you can call me Rocky.

21:27.887 --> 21:30.521
Ball! Ball, ball, ball, ball...

21:30.523 --> 21:33.424
Get away from me,
you great galoot!

21:33.426 --> 21:36.927
Now your mission is done,
how do we get you home?

21:36.929 --> 21:39.964
Ah, well... you see, my, uh...

21:39.966 --> 21:42.667
my spaceship, it, um...

21:42.669 --> 21:46.304
yeah, it's quite far away,
and it might be, uh...

21:46.306 --> 21:48.372
just a teensy bit crashed.

21:48.374 --> 21:50.508
So it doesn't exactly fly
any more.

21:50.510 --> 21:53.744
- But then you can't go home.
- And...

21:55.948 --> 21:59.083
No, no, but, but wait.
It may not fly,

21:59.085 --> 22:01.552
but now that
I've conquered the planet,

22:01.554 --> 22:05.323
I'm allowed to use the homing
beacon and they'll pick me up.

22:05.325 --> 22:08.693
They have to come anyway
to, uh, um...

22:08.695 --> 22:12.663
well, to see this lovely planet
that I've conquered, obviously.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.465
Well, let's go to your ship.

22:14.467 --> 22:17.101
- Yeah!
- It's a long walk, I'm afraid.

22:17.103 --> 22:18.903
Long walk? I'm out!

22:18.905 --> 22:21.105
- You don't have to come.
- Oh, I'm coming!

22:21.107 --> 22:23.808
- Why are you always so grumpy?
- Exactly.

22:23.810 --> 22:26.644
Let's get going
and get this over with.

22:26.646 --> 22:31.048
- Actually, it's this way.
- No, it's not, it's this way.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.953
Huh? What the...?

22:43.596 --> 22:45.396
Hmm!

22:59.846 --> 23:02.713
Huh?

23:02.715 --> 23:04.548
What? Hm?

23:05.651 --> 23:08.719
Oh! Hm-hm.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.826
Ah!

23:15.828 --> 23:17.661

23:35.815 --> 23:38.048
- <i>♪ There, so there</i>
- Yeah. Yeah.

23:42.889 --> 23:46.624
- That's a great song.
- Yeah.

23:46.626 --> 23:48.426
A little bit treasonous, but...

23:50.897 --> 23:53.130
What's Scaldron like?
You have mangoes there?

23:53.132 --> 23:56.467
No. But we do have giant
flaming death tarantulas.

23:56.469 --> 23:58.452
How about pears?

23:58.454 --> 24:00.438
Most of the tarantulas
were eaten by doom snakes.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.456
Pineapples?

24:02.458 --> 24:04.475
And the snakes were dissolved
by acidic slime wolves.

24:04.477 --> 24:06.577
Oh. Bananas?

24:06.579 --> 24:11.215
- Oh yeah, huge bananas.
- Sounds amazing.

24:32.104 --> 24:35.806
Huh?

24:36.609 --> 24:38.843
Hm...

25:19.151 --> 25:20.918
This is great.

25:20.920 --> 25:24.955
It's like a backing track
for our triumphant new leader.

25:24.957 --> 25:28.125
Leader?

25:28.127 --> 25:31.729
There's only one leader
around here.

25:31.731 --> 25:34.899
And it is me.

25:34.901 --> 25:38.636
No, Fneep's the leader.
Aren't you, Fneep?

25:38.638 --> 25:42.806
Well, yeah. Yeah. Yes, I am.

25:42.808 --> 25:44.909
I mean, I gave a speech
and everything.

25:44.911 --> 25:46.644
It was very good.

25:46.646 --> 25:50.047
I even, well, for a moment
at least, pointed my...

25:50.049 --> 25:52.583
you know, G-U-N.

25:52.585 --> 25:54.585
A gnu?

25:54.587 --> 25:57.321
You pointed a gnu?
What does that even mean?

25:57.323 --> 26:00.224
- No, that's not...
- Look, speech or no speech,

26:00.226 --> 26:06.030
pointing gnu or no pointing gnu,
you are not the leader.

26:06.032 --> 26:08.699
- Am too.
- Ooh!

26:08.701 --> 26:12.169
"Am too." That's a good one.
I didn't see that coming.

26:12.171 --> 26:16.674
- Try saying "Are not" again.
- Brilliant. Yeah, OK, OK.

26:17.810 --> 26:20.945
Are not.

26:20.947 --> 26:24.648
Am too.

26:24.650 --> 26:27.184
Double repeat.
He went with the double repeat.

26:27.186 --> 26:31.088
He's good. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
I know.

26:31.657 --> 26:33.290
Why?

26:33.292 --> 26:34.792
Because.

26:34.794 --> 26:37.861
Curse your freakishly wily
retorts!

26:37.863 --> 26:41.699
Try to stick your tongue out
and go...

26:41.701 --> 26:46.937
- Like this? Aah..
- No, no, no.

26:46.939 --> 26:51.942
It's more closed, like this.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.844
Aah...

26:53.846 --> 26:56.380
Just tighten your lips and blow.

27:00.052 --> 27:02.653
Oh, I got it!

27:06.292 --> 27:07.992
Where are you going?

27:07.994 --> 27:11.228
- Back to my ship.
- Stop him!

27:18.838 --> 27:21.271
Huh?!

27:21.273 --> 27:25.042
Huh? That is very disconcerting!

27:25.044 --> 27:26.844
Oh.

27:27.680 --> 27:29.046
Um...

27:29.048 --> 27:31.949
Sorry.

27:31.951 --> 27:34.652
Pardon me.
Coming through.

27:34.654 --> 27:37.888
Oops. Let me just...

27:37.890 --> 27:41.258
Sorry about...

27:41.260 --> 27:43.427
You're all surprisingly OK
with the fact

27:43.429 --> 27:46.997
that you can suddenly talk
and sing. Why is that?

27:46.999 --> 27:50.801
Before this all you really did
was eat grass and stam...

27:50.803 --> 27:52.369
Stop!

27:52.371 --> 27:55.039
Don't say that word.

27:55.041 --> 27:58.308
What, stam...?

27:58.310 --> 28:01.111
How about stam...

28:01.113 --> 28:03.147
...poodle?

28:03.149 --> 28:05.015

Oh, but that's...
that's just wrong.

28:20.700 --> 28:23.000
Oh, give me a sec.

28:23.002 --> 28:26.437
- Words are one thing.
- And oozing...

28:26.439 --> 28:29.106
Walking through legs is another.

28:29.108 --> 28:33.444
But you do not have
the singing voice of a leader.

28:33.446 --> 28:36.113
And everyone knows
the best singer...

28:36.115 --> 28:40.184
<i>♪ Is always the leader!</i>

28:40.186 --> 28:43.921

Oh...

28:52.264 --> 28:55.165
The second-best singer
is always the leader.

28:55.167 --> 29:01.171
And that's me. I can do
the squiggly bits.

29:14.820 --> 29:16.954
And, I can go...

29:22.328 --> 29:28.132
- Hm!
- <i>♪ All the way up he-e-ere!</i>

29:28.134 --> 29:32.970
You need to go high
to be leader, do you?

29:32.972 --> 29:34.304
Is this high enough?

29:34.306 --> 29:37.241
- Or how about this?
- Huh?

29:37.243 --> 29:39.510
Oh, that's very good.

29:39.512 --> 29:42.880
- I didn't know it could do that!
- That doesn't count.

29:42.882 --> 29:46.283
- We're all high-pitched.
- I can go high. I'm the leader.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.352
No, me. I'm the leader.

29:48.354 --> 29:52.790
Leader, leader, leader...

29:52.792 --> 29:55.425
Oh, who am I? I'm the leader.

29:55.427 --> 29:59.296
Look. Oh, uh, hang on a sec,
let me just...

29:59.298 --> 30:01.565
I'm the leader. I am.

30:01.567 --> 30:05.803
- What happened?
- Oh, man!

30:07.807 --> 30:09.940
Look, you're great
at what you do.

30:09.942 --> 30:12.910
Right, guys?

30:12.912 --> 30:16.013
It's not because you can sing
high that others follow you.

30:16.015 --> 30:18.282
It's because
you love what you do.

30:18.284 --> 30:19.583
I do love singing.

30:19.585 --> 30:22.252
They love singing with you
because you love it.

30:22.254 --> 30:25.088
Not because you say
you can do it,

30:25.090 --> 30:28.425
or tell them to do it,
because you just do it.

30:28.427 --> 30:31.528
I concede,
you're a better singer than me.

30:31.530 --> 30:34.264
- That's true.
- But I did conquer the planet.

30:34.266 --> 30:38.135
So, I'd really like
to keep moving along now.

30:38.971 --> 30:41.004
Of course.

30:44.577 --> 30:48.912
Aw. That makes me all warm
and fuzzy on the inside.

30:48.914 --> 30:52.182
I'm warm and fuzzy
on the outside. Feel.

30:52.184 --> 30:56.887
Hey, Trunk, watch this.

30:56.889 --> 30:59.056
Stam...

30:59.058 --> 31:00.557
...potato.

31:00.559 --> 31:01.625

31:01.627 --> 31:03.393

31:03.395 --> 31:07.531
I wanna try. Stam...

31:07.533 --> 31:09.533
...pede!

31:09.535 --> 31:11.301
Stampede!

31:11.303 --> 31:13.537
Did I do it wrong?

31:13.539 --> 31:15.606
Yee-ha!

31:15.608 --> 31:20.577
Oh, boy, I sure love it
when a stampede gets going.

31:20.579 --> 31:23.981
Nothing that anyone can say
can stop it.

31:23.983 --> 31:27.918
We just charge and charge
right through everything,

31:27.920 --> 31:30.921
destroying everything
in our path.

31:30.923 --> 31:35.525
Nothing gets in our way,
yes, sirree!

31:36.629 --> 31:41.365
See? Told you. Stampe-e-ede.

32:18.103 --> 32:20.437
You know,
you did great back there.

32:20.439 --> 32:24.041
Yeah.
That was very leader-y of you.

32:24.043 --> 32:28.145
Hey, wait up.
I wanna come too.

32:32.384 --> 32:33.417
No!

32:33.419 --> 32:37.287
No! No! No! No!
No, no, please, no!

32:39.158 --> 32:41.124
So, where are we going?

32:41.126 --> 32:43.393
Thank goodness.

32:43.395 --> 32:46.229
Hey, it's OK.
It wasn't your fault.

32:46.231 --> 32:52.369
I'm a bird!
Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes!

32:52.371 --> 32:56.006
Check these out. Whoo-hoo.

32:58.978 --> 33:01.712
I can fly!

33:05.451 --> 33:07.250
Awesome!

33:07.252 --> 33:09.720
Oh! Thank goodness you're OK.

33:09.722 --> 33:14.624
Again! I wanna go again!
I wanna fly!

33:14.626 --> 33:19.429
Oh, Baby. We're ostriches.
We live on the ground.

33:19.431 --> 33:22.666
Hm. I'm not convinced.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.470
Whoo-hoo!

33:26.472 --> 33:32.142
- Whoa!
- Oh, baby, you can't fly.

33:32.144 --> 33:36.413
You're kidding.
Then what are these for?

33:36.415 --> 33:39.316
I think they're for this.

33:46.258 --> 33:50.293
- Fneep, you OK?
- Can I get back to my ship, now?

33:50.295 --> 33:53.230
Yeah, yeah, sure thing.
Lead the way.

33:55.134 --> 33:58.668
Come on, young lady.
It's back to the nest for you.

33:58.670 --> 34:01.138
Can I try again?
If I was a bit higher,

34:01.140 --> 34:02.439
I'd have enough forward thrust

34:02.441 --> 34:05.175
and the air-pressure
differential would be able

34:05.177 --> 34:07.511
to generate sufficient lift
to be able to fly.

34:07.513 --> 34:11.114
I'm not letting you
out of my sight again.

34:11.116 --> 34:14.117
- Come along.
- Oh, man.

34:14.119 --> 34:18.288
Stampede.

34:18.290 --> 34:23.293
Yee-haw!

34:34.473 --> 34:38.241
Huh?

34:39.277 --> 34:41.610
Huh?

34:55.094 --> 34:57.427
Huh?

35:33.265 --> 35:35.765
You OK?
What happened back there?

35:35.767 --> 35:37.667
Why was she
squeezing her?

35:37.669 --> 35:39.803
- Huh?
- The mother one.

35:39.805 --> 35:43.340
Why was she
squeezing the baby one?

35:43.342 --> 35:47.244
Squeezing?
Oh, that's called a hug.

35:47.246 --> 35:50.413
You don't have hugs
where you're from?

35:50.415 --> 35:51.414
What's it for?

35:51.416 --> 35:54.284
It's to make you feel better.

35:54.286 --> 35:56.186
To say, "I love you."

35:56.188 --> 35:58.455
To let you know
you're not alone.

35:58.457 --> 36:01.625
To let you know you're special.

36:01.627 --> 36:04.628
I can't believe you don't have
hugs where you're from.

36:04.630 --> 36:06.563
How do you say "I love you"?

36:06.565 --> 36:08.632
Well, we don't.

36:08.634 --> 36:13.470
What?
How do you ever feel special?

36:13.472 --> 36:15.906
The only way to do that
is to conquer planets.

36:15.908 --> 36:18.708
That shows you're strong
and worthy of respect.

36:18.710 --> 36:21.211
The more planets,
the more respect,

36:21.213 --> 36:23.680
and the more special you feel.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.215
Or so I've heard.

36:25.217 --> 36:28.785
Sounds like pretty hard work
to feel special.

36:28.787 --> 36:33.657
But you haven't conquered
any planets until this one.

36:33.659 --> 36:36.626
You don't need
to remind me.

36:36.628 --> 36:40.664
Has no one ever told you
you're special before?

36:41.733 --> 36:43.934
Hu-u-u-ug!

36:43.936 --> 36:45.669
No, that's quite all right.

36:45.671 --> 36:48.471
Hug, hug, hug, hug, hug, hug!

36:48.473 --> 36:50.189
It doesn't matter to us

36:50.191 --> 36:51.908
that you haven't conquered
lots of planets.

36:51.910 --> 36:54.945
- Yeah.
- Hug, hug, hug, hug, hug.

36:54.947 --> 36:56.947
Get back!

36:59.318 --> 37:02.285
Please, just don't, OK?

37:03.322 --> 37:05.422
Hug?

37:46.365 --> 37:48.698
Huh? Huh?

38:25.070 --> 38:26.986
What's that?

38:26.988 --> 38:28.905
I didn't have breakfast
this morning.

38:28.907 --> 38:32.742
Sometimes there just aren't
enough bananas to go around!

38:34.379 --> 38:37.580
Oh, somebody get him
something to eat quick!

38:37.582 --> 38:40.450
Running.

38:43.655 --> 38:46.389
Oh, they're coming this way!

38:50.729 --> 38:55.532
- Running!
- Climb up quick! Come on.

38:55.534 --> 38:57.434
Grab on. You'll be safe up here.

38:57.436 --> 39:00.403
I can't. It's against the rules
to be safe.

39:01.540 --> 39:02.906
Incoming!

39:02.908 --> 39:05.342
Come on! I'm trying to help you.

39:05.344 --> 39:06.776
Why do you keep trying to help?

39:06.778 --> 39:09.846
I'm a Scaldronian. Scaldronians
never ask for help. Never!

39:09.848 --> 39:12.415
Well, monkeys always help.
Always!

39:12.417 --> 39:14.617
And elephants! Get up here!

39:14.619 --> 39:18.088
OK.
We're backing up, backing up.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.391
What are you doing?

39:21.393 --> 39:24.060
I won't leave you alone
down here.

39:24.062 --> 39:26.363
Guys, you're gonna get smooshed!

39:26.365 --> 39:28.932
- Get back up!
- Not without you!

39:28.934 --> 39:32.869
- Why won't you just let me be?
- Because we're your friends!

39:32.871 --> 39:36.573
Smooshing imminent!

39:39.811 --> 39:42.445
So, just to confirm,

39:42.447 --> 39:45.582
I'm still the lead singer,
right?

39:45.584 --> 39:47.851
Yes, you are.

39:47.853 --> 39:50.587
Great. Glad that's settled.

39:51.790 --> 39:53.757
Why didn't you climb on board?

39:53.759 --> 39:56.059
Did you not hear
about the smooshing?

39:56.061 --> 39:58.411
I can't keep taking your help.

39:58.413 --> 40:00.764
You don't understand what it is
to have your planet conquered.

40:00.766 --> 40:02.432
Uh, nope!

40:02.434 --> 40:05.034
But we do understand something
about home.

40:05.036 --> 40:07.537
You're not supposed
to want to help me get home!

40:07.539 --> 40:10.907
- You're not supposed to like me.
- But we were just trying to...

40:10.909 --> 40:13.543
Help. I know.
I wish you wouldn't.

40:13.545 --> 40:17.013
You're making this much harder
for me than it should be.

40:17.015 --> 40:18.982
I really wish
you'd leave me alone now

40:18.984 --> 40:22.819
and stop trying to be
so nice to me.

40:26.091 --> 40:28.925
He seems a bit down.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.060
He's never had a,

40:31.062 --> 40:35.432
you know, H-U-G before.

40:35.434 --> 40:37.567
What's a hgu?

40:39.805 --> 40:43.640
Rolling, rolling, rolling...

40:43.642 --> 40:47.510
Rolling? Huh! I can talk again.

40:47.512 --> 40:51.114
Whoa! Dizzy.

40:51.116 --> 40:53.683
I like it. What? No, I don't.

40:53.685 --> 40:56.119
You like it.
Who said that? What?

40:56.121 --> 41:01.658
OK, I'm talking, so I must be
close to the others.

41:03.829 --> 41:07.630
Wait until I find you,
give you a piece of my mind.

41:07.632 --> 41:10.033
Not just one piece.
I'll give you three.

41:10.035 --> 41:14.137
Tell you what, let's make it
four. Do I hear five? Huh?

41:18.910 --> 41:20.677
Oh!

41:20.679 --> 41:22.779
Shiny.

41:43.535 --> 41:46.002
Oh. Oh!

41:48.707 --> 41:51.007
Nyah!

41:52.811 --> 41:54.878
Oh...

41:57.249 --> 42:00.984
That's the shiniest thing
I've ever seen.

42:00.986 --> 42:05.221
I want to touch it.
I want to taste it.

42:06.925 --> 42:10.693
No! It's a bad idea!
Definitely a bad idea.

42:10.695 --> 42:13.129
And yet, somehow I...

42:13.131 --> 42:15.732
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

42:16.701 --> 42:20.069
Ah! Aa-a-ah!

42:29.014 --> 42:31.597
<i>Fneep,</i>

42:31.599 --> 42:34.183
<i>report on your current status
immediately.</i>

42:37.022 --> 42:39.589
<i>Fneep,
it has been two Earth months</i>

42:39.591 --> 42:43.293
<i>since your last report.
Feedback immediately.</i>

42:44.930 --> 42:47.964
<i>How much longer
is it going to be, Fneep?</i>

42:47.966 --> 42:49.566
<i>The transporters are ready.</i>

42:49.568 --> 42:51.568
<i>Once you have conquered
the planet,</i>

42:51.570 --> 42:54.037
<i>we initiate the removal
of the Earth creatures.</i>

42:54.039 --> 42:56.339
<i>Report back immediately!</i>

42:56.341 --> 42:59.976
Take us away? I must warn
the others. I gotta...

43:33.612 --> 43:35.912
You're still there, aren't you?

43:38.883 --> 43:40.617
Oh.

43:44.255 --> 43:46.789
It's very lonely being alone.

43:46.791 --> 43:49.959
We'll stay with you
until you feel better.

44:13.818 --> 44:16.386
Uh, is this...?
What's, what's going...

44:16.388 --> 44:19.088
I didn't quite follow that
at all. Um...

44:19.090 --> 44:23.059
It's just
close to our bedtime.

44:23.061 --> 44:25.928
When the sun sets,
we go to sleep.

44:25.930 --> 44:28.064
Sunset.

44:28.833 --> 44:31.834
It's... It's...

44:31.836 --> 44:34.303
We don't get sunsets
on Scaldron.

44:34.305 --> 44:37.306
Not since
we set the atmosphere on fire.

44:37.308 --> 44:42.945
You should see a sunrise.
It's amazing.

44:56.795 --> 44:58.327
Huh?

45:07.872 --> 45:11.374
Hm.

45:29.327 --> 45:32.462
- I say.
- How wonderful.

45:32.464 --> 45:36.966
- Amazing.
- So beautiful.

45:40.972 --> 45:43.372
Behold Fneep's star!

45:43.374 --> 45:47.944
He has conquered a planet,
and become a Scaldronian hero!

45:47.946 --> 45:50.213
Fneep!

45:50.215 --> 45:53.149
Fneep's so awesome,
amazing and not insignificant.

45:53.151 --> 45:55.218
He's not
a disappointment.

45:55.220 --> 45:58.855
I love that he's shorter
and smaller than the rest of us!

45:58.857 --> 46:00.757
Yes, Fneep,

46:00.759 --> 46:03.493
your Earthling captives
will make fine specimens

46:03.495 --> 46:08.231
in the Great Hall of Conquest.

47:02.020 --> 47:03.553
Oh!

47:06.558 --> 47:07.990
Oh!

47:14.432 --> 47:16.265
Aah!

47:19.404 --> 47:21.103
Hm-mm!

47:22.140 --> 47:23.539
Hmm!

47:32.483 --> 47:36.018
Oh!

47:36.588 --> 47:38.321
Hmm!

47:39.023 --> 47:40.356
Hmm?

47:40.358 --> 47:43.159
Uh-uh.

47:43.161 --> 47:45.027
Hmm.

47:49.467 --> 47:51.367
Ohhh.

48:30.975 --> 48:32.408
Huh?

48:33.411 --> 48:34.944
Ha!

48:51.629 --> 48:54.330
Huh?

49:19.691 --> 49:23.259
Huh. Brilliant.

49:26.698 --> 49:29.465
<i>Fneep, it has been
two Earth months</i>

49:29.467 --> 49:34.103
<i>since your last report.
Feed back immediately.</i>

49:34.105 --> 49:37.239
<i>How much longer is it...?</i>

49:37.241 --> 49:40.576
No much longer, that's how much.
Because I've done it.

49:40.578 --> 49:43.646
Conquered a planet.
Didn't see that coming, did you?

49:43.648 --> 49:46.282
Oooh, Fneep can't do any...

49:47.218 --> 49:50.453
Fneep can't do...

49:50.455 --> 49:52.521
Fneep can't do...

49:58.096 --> 50:01.230
Oh, come on.
Can't I do anything?

50:02.300 --> 50:04.333
Homing beacon.

50:06.137 --> 50:08.371
Homing beacon.

50:13.311 --> 50:17.246
Planet Conquering Manual,
Third Edition. Let's see.

50:17.248 --> 50:21.517
Hm... A-ha! Homing beacon.
"Caution."

50:21.519 --> 50:22.685
"Using the homing beacon

50:22.687 --> 50:24.553
before you have
conquered your planet

50:24.555 --> 50:27.556
will bring you great shame."
Ah, brilliant.

50:27.558 --> 50:30.760
OK. "If you really want to use
the homing beacon,

50:30.762 --> 50:32.495
turn to page 107."

50:32.497 --> 50:37.433
107. "Step one: ask yourself

50:37.435 --> 50:40.136
if you really want to use
the homing beacon."

50:40.138 --> 50:43.339
Yes, I really want to use
the homing beacon.

50:43.341 --> 50:46.308
"Step two: repeat step one
just to be sure."

50:46.310 --> 50:48.077
Oh, come on!

50:49.213 --> 50:53.416
Huh?

51:13.571 --> 51:15.504
Huh?!

51:17.442 --> 51:21.744
Huh?

51:32.623 --> 51:35.291
Aah!

51:38.596 --> 51:40.663
Ooh!

51:46.537 --> 51:50.139
Ooooh!

51:55.646 --> 51:58.747
"Step 59:

51:58.749 --> 52:01.784
if you haven't conquered
your planet yet,

52:01.786 --> 52:06.388
then using the homing beacon
will not only bring shame to you

52:06.390 --> 52:10.392
but also sully the great name of
the mighty Scaldronian people,

52:10.394 --> 52:12.328
who will be very angry."

52:12.330 --> 52:15.231
No surprises there then.

52:15.233 --> 52:17.800
"Think deeply about
that for a bit...

52:20.571 --> 52:22.738
...then proceed to step 60."

52:22.740 --> 52:25.875
"Step 60: to activate..."

52:25.877 --> 52:27.776
Ooh, here we go then.

52:27.778 --> 52:31.647
"To activate the homing beacon,
press the big red button."

52:35.353 --> 52:38.454
That's it? That... Nothing else?

52:38.456 --> 52:42.458
Just press the... Sixty points!

52:42.460 --> 52:44.793
Sixty points to tell me
to press a button?

52:44.795 --> 52:48.764
Sixty points to tell me
to push a button!

52:48.766 --> 52:50.900
OK. Oof. OK.

52:50.902 --> 52:53.269
OK, fine. Yeah, that's... OK.

52:53.271 --> 52:55.204
Here we go.

53:53.497 --> 53:55.364
OK.

54:24.629 --> 54:29.932
So, Fneep, you've finally
done it, have you?

54:29.934 --> 54:32.301
Conquered a planet.

54:34.472 --> 54:37.706
I didn't think
you had it in you.

54:47.018 --> 54:48.550
Huh?

54:52.657 --> 54:54.523
There he is.

54:54.525 --> 54:56.592
Huh?! We can speak again.

54:56.594 --> 54:58.794
And there's another one.

54:59.563 --> 55:01.463
Shh!

55:11.008 --> 55:12.808
Where are the Earth creatures,
Fneep?

55:12.810 --> 55:15.844
The transporters are ready
to take them away.

55:15.846 --> 55:18.547
- Take us away?
- You see?

55:18.549 --> 55:20.749
- You knew about this?
- Yes!

55:20.751 --> 55:26.088
Why didn't you tell us?

55:26.090 --> 55:30.092
Fneep, why haven't you
launched your star yet?

55:32.396 --> 55:34.797
This is no time to be bashful.

55:34.799 --> 55:36.432
Launch your star to prove

55:36.434 --> 55:37.900
that you've conquered
this planet

55:37.902 --> 55:41.503
so we can gather your captives
and take them to Scaldron.

55:41.505 --> 55:46.475
I have launched 999 stars

55:46.477 --> 55:49.845
to declare the planets
I have conquered so far.

55:49.847 --> 55:52.081
This will be your first.

55:52.083 --> 55:57.086
Well, get on with it, Fneep.
What are you waiting for?

55:57.088 --> 55:59.121
Oi.

56:00.624 --> 56:02.491
Fneep?

56:02.493 --> 56:05.394
Fneep.

56:05.396 --> 56:10.933
Did you or did you not
conquer this planet?

56:11.669 --> 56:13.402
I did...

56:13.838 --> 56:15.571
...not.

56:15.573 --> 56:17.740
I... I lied.

56:17.742 --> 56:20.876
My ship was broken,
and I needed you to collect me.

56:20.878 --> 56:22.411
What is he doing?

56:22.413 --> 56:26.415
You brought me here
for a rescue mission?

56:26.417 --> 56:29.752
I... I thought, seeing as you're
my father, you might come and...

56:29.754 --> 56:31.387
Watch you fail again?

56:31.389 --> 56:35.724
I am Grogon the Conqueror,
not Nogorg the Loiterer!

56:35.726 --> 56:39.428
When you called me,
I was conquering a nebula.

56:39.430 --> 56:43.465
Do you know how hard that is?
They're mainly gas!

56:43.467 --> 56:47.136
And what kind of Scaldronian
asks for help?

56:47.138 --> 56:50.139
- Didn't you read step one?
- Yes.

56:50.141 --> 56:55.677
And did you read it again
just to be sure?

56:55.679 --> 56:59.882
We can't let that big blue bully
talk to him like that!

57:00.918 --> 57:03.085
Well, seeing as we're here...

57:04.989 --> 57:06.722
Huh?

57:08.559 --> 57:12.895
...I might as well
get my thousandth victory!

57:12.897 --> 57:14.797
I'll conquer the planet

57:14.799 --> 57:19.034
and capture
its inhabitants myself.

57:21.806 --> 57:23.806
No, Dad, you can't.

57:23.808 --> 57:27.042
You don't tell me
what I can or cannot do.

57:27.044 --> 57:30.612
I'm the can or cannot do teller.

57:34.785 --> 57:36.919
You... You don't understand.

57:36.921 --> 57:39.154
These creatures...
These creatures are

57:39.156 --> 57:41.457
more powerful
than you can imagine.

57:41.459 --> 57:43.459
Not more powerful than this.

57:43.461 --> 57:46.595
They eat those and shoot them
out of their mouths.

57:46.597 --> 57:48.063
But it's new.

57:48.065 --> 57:50.532
And there's one
that's just a fury-ball

57:50.534 --> 57:53.569
of razor-sharp spikes.

57:53.571 --> 57:54.970
Another possesses the power

57:54.972 --> 57:57.539
to suck the life
right out of you

57:57.541 --> 58:01.477
- without even touching you.
- I don't do that. Do I?

58:01.479 --> 58:05.547
And one's an unstoppable force,
a giant creature

58:05.549 --> 58:08.217
with a horn on its face.

58:08.219 --> 58:11.186
- On its face?
- Yes.

58:11.188 --> 58:14.923
Able to crush anything
in its path!

58:14.925 --> 58:19.528
Another one so furry
and with a tail so...

58:19.530 --> 58:22.564
- Furry? And a tail?
- Yes!

58:22.566 --> 58:24.733
That does what?

58:24.735 --> 58:28.604
Uh, nothing really, actually.
He's not so scary.

58:29.807 --> 58:30.906
But the others...

58:30.908 --> 58:32.608
Come to think of it,

58:32.610 --> 58:36.745
this piddly planet
isn't really worth my time.

58:36.747 --> 58:40.616
You know this means
you won't be going home again?

58:40.618 --> 58:42.551
It's straight on
to the next planet

58:42.553 --> 58:44.920
for you to fail to conquer.

58:44.922 --> 58:46.722
Yes.

58:48.225 --> 58:50.259
Why is Fneep doing this?

58:50.261 --> 58:52.928
To protect us.

59:06.544 --> 59:09.678
I'm doing this
for your own good, Fneep.

59:09.680 --> 59:14.116
It's the only way to stop you
being so weedy and useless.

59:35.339 --> 59:37.673
<i>Attention all hands.</i>

59:37.675 --> 59:41.610
<i>Gather in the main atrium
for Fneep shaming.</i>

59:43.714 --> 59:46.915
- Rubbish.
- So insignificant.

59:46.917 --> 59:49.885
- Such a disappointment.
- So much shorter and smaller

59:49.887 --> 59:51.286
than the rest of us.

59:51.288 --> 59:54.222
I had money
on you doing this, boy.

59:54.224 --> 59:56.925
Prepare
for launch initiation.

01:00:33.931 --> 01:00:37.265
Set sights for...
Where should it be?

01:00:37.267 --> 01:00:40.736
The Endless Bogs of Scorpulus?

01:00:40.738 --> 01:00:43.672
The Stench World of Gamma Six?

01:00:43.674 --> 01:00:47.643
The Flame Fields of... Dennis.

01:00:47.645 --> 01:00:51.213
Or the Un-Planet
of Quadrant Elty-Two?

01:00:51.215 --> 01:00:55.183
Where is it
you would like to go, Fneep?

01:00:55.185 --> 01:00:56.652
Home.

01:00:56.654 --> 01:00:58.353
What was that?

01:01:00.391 --> 01:01:03.091
Hey?

01:01:03.093 --> 01:01:05.293
<i>Pod breach, level one.</i>

01:01:14.672 --> 01:01:18.173
I said, he'd like to go home!

01:01:18.175 --> 01:01:19.875
What is this?

01:01:19.877 --> 01:01:21.710
It's not safe for you here.

01:01:21.712 --> 01:01:25.113
Ha! I laugh in the face
of not safeness.

01:01:25.115 --> 01:01:27.249
Oh, Fneep,

01:01:27.251 --> 01:01:32.721
is that the fury-ball of spikes?
Really? That little thing?

01:01:32.723 --> 01:01:35.357
Coochy, coochy, coochy.

01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:36.992
Huh!

01:01:36.994 --> 01:01:38.326
A-ha!

01:01:38.328 --> 01:01:39.361
Aah!

01:01:39.363 --> 01:01:41.697
Oh!

01:01:41.699 --> 01:01:45.467
A-ha! Me likey spikey.

01:01:45.469 --> 01:01:49.805
- We said we'd help you get home.
- That's what we're going to do.

01:01:49.807 --> 01:01:52.107
The only way Fneep is going home

01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:55.010
is when he's conquered a planet
and that's never...

01:01:55.012 --> 01:01:57.746
He <i>has</i> conquered one! This one!

01:01:57.748 --> 01:01:59.948
- Haven't you, Fneep?
- No, he didn't.

01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:02.451
He said he lied
about conquering it.

01:02:02.453 --> 01:02:05.787
I... lied about lying?

01:02:05.789 --> 01:02:08.857
- You did conquer it?
- Uh, yes.

01:02:08.859 --> 01:02:10.325
And we're his captives.

01:02:10.327 --> 01:02:11.993
Is that true?

01:02:11.995 --> 01:02:16.198
Um, I, uh... guess so. But...

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:20.035
He can release us
if he wants to. Can't you?

01:02:20.037 --> 01:02:23.038
Well, yes, I guess I can.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.139
No, you can't!

01:02:24.141 --> 01:02:25.841
We're Scaldronians!

01:02:25.843 --> 01:02:28.376
Scaldronians
don't just release captives.

01:02:28.378 --> 01:02:30.912
That's the opposite
of what Scaldronians do.

01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:33.181
It's my planet.
I can do what I like with it.

01:02:33.183 --> 01:02:35.183
It's not your planet yet, Fneep.

01:02:35.185 --> 01:02:37.853
I don't see your star
in the sky.

01:02:37.855 --> 01:02:41.256
And if your star
isn't in the sky,

01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:43.058
the planet remains open.

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:47.863
I think perhaps I'll conquer it
myself after all.

01:02:47.865 --> 01:02:50.899
Surrender to me or...

01:02:50.901 --> 01:02:52.534
Be careful. It's new.

01:02:52.536 --> 01:02:54.936
Don't you know
it's rude to point?

01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:57.339
I didn't know
it was rude to point.

01:02:57.341 --> 01:03:01.476
I'd point all day long.
I'd point at you and you

01:03:01.478 --> 01:03:04.479
and you and you
and you and you...

01:03:04.481 --> 01:03:07.215
What is this thing anyway?

01:03:14.158 --> 01:03:16.525
Be careful, Trunk,
don't press...

01:03:16.527 --> 01:03:18.927
...that.

01:03:23.167 --> 01:03:24.833
Trunk!

01:03:59.203 --> 01:04:02.304
Huh?! Oh!

01:04:04.208 --> 01:04:05.507
Huh?!

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:27.562
Whoopsy, Fneep. Lost your star?

01:04:27.564 --> 01:04:32.033
Never mind,
I have mine right here.

01:04:32.035 --> 01:04:37.939
We wouldn't want this planet
to go unclaimed now, would we?

01:04:37.941 --> 01:04:40.108
Hey, what the...?

01:04:42.145 --> 01:04:46.448
That's right.
Furry and with a tail.

01:04:51.455 --> 01:04:53.588
Oh, dear!

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.333
Uh-oh.

01:05:09.306 --> 01:05:11.439
Whoa!

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:24.519
Gotcha!

01:05:24.521 --> 01:05:27.522
Huh?!

01:05:27.524 --> 01:05:30.358
Huh?

01:05:37.334 --> 01:05:40.268
Hey. Wait. Leave me alone.

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:42.704
Hey, get your hands
off my friend!

01:05:42.706 --> 01:05:44.339
I mean, uh...

01:05:44.341 --> 01:05:48.009
Friend?
You were gonna say friend.

01:05:48.011 --> 01:05:49.978
No. I mean, uh...

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:52.480
Rule number six:
never finish a word

01:05:52.482 --> 01:05:56.318
- that I'm beginning to finish.
- Frie-e-end!

01:06:02.025 --> 01:06:04.626
Oh...

01:06:11.335 --> 01:06:15.236
I've gotta launch my star.
Now, where did I...?

01:06:15.238 --> 01:06:16.972
Oh.

01:06:23.113 --> 01:06:25.480
Ooh, look at this.

01:06:25.482 --> 01:06:29.617
- I wonder what it does.
- Let me see. I wanna...

01:06:29.619 --> 01:06:32.420
Oh, who am I kidding?

01:06:32.422 --> 01:06:34.656
It looks like some sort of egg.

01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:38.660
Egg? This nest
ain't big enough... Whoa!

01:06:38.662 --> 01:06:42.764
It's OK, Mama.
You don't need to cheer me up.

01:06:42.766 --> 01:06:47.168
It's OK that I can't fly.
I'm just going to...

01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:52.140
crawl around on the ground
like a little worm.

01:06:58.081 --> 01:07:01.349
- Trunk.
- Fneep's star thingy!

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:03.084
This is Fneep's star thingy,

01:07:03.086 --> 01:07:06.388
the things he needs to shoot
into the sky to save us!

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:12.027
Um, I'm not sure
if I understand you, dear.

01:07:12.029 --> 01:07:15.296
Or that.

01:07:21.671 --> 01:07:24.572
I know you're here somewhere!

01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:29.778
Hm?

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:33.448
What?

01:07:39.523 --> 01:07:41.056
Huh?

01:08:04.114 --> 01:08:05.447
Oh!

01:08:17.227 --> 01:08:19.627
Ha-ha!

01:08:19.629 --> 01:08:21.830
- Huh?!
- Ha-ha as well!

01:08:21.832 --> 01:08:25.733
Here I am! Now I'm here.

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:31.738
Trunk!

01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:35.510
- Munki?
- Fneep needs his star!

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:37.412
- I know.
- What's going on?

01:08:37.413 --> 01:08:42.716
- Munki's flying.
- Oh, sure, Munki's flying.

01:08:42.719 --> 01:08:44.486
Not that I care.

01:08:44.488 --> 01:08:50.390
I get to crawl in the depths
of despair and disappointment

01:08:50.393 --> 01:08:54.328
for the rest of my life.
Whoopee.

01:08:55.599 --> 01:08:57.732
If Fneep doesn't
get that star,

01:08:57.734 --> 01:08:59.234
- we're doomed!
- Yes...

01:08:59.236 --> 01:09:01.402
The future of the world
is in your hands.

01:09:01.404 --> 01:09:03.371
- I got that!
- No pressure.

01:09:03.372 --> 01:09:08.443
But really,
it's kind of a big de-e-e-eal!

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.446
Shoot it up there.

01:09:11.448 --> 01:09:16.518
Oh. It'll bounce off the ship.
I need someone to take it.

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:19.821
Me! Me, me, me, me, me!
I can take it!

01:09:19.823 --> 01:09:22.756
No chance, young lady.
You're gonna stay...

01:09:22.759 --> 01:09:26.461
Right here
for the rest of my life,

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:28.395
never doing anything?

01:09:28.398 --> 01:09:31.866
- No, that's not...!
- Mama, I can do this.

01:09:31.868 --> 01:09:34.569
I've been waiting my whole life
for this.

01:09:34.571 --> 01:09:36.604
- You hatched yesterday.
- Shh!

01:09:36.606 --> 01:09:39.474
How can I let Trunk
shoot you up there?

01:09:39.475 --> 01:09:42.844
- What if she misses?
- Ahem. Hm!

01:09:48.285 --> 01:09:51.853
Hm!

01:09:53.456 --> 01:09:56.324
Pistachios.

01:09:56.326 --> 01:09:58.359
Surely it's not
that important that...

01:09:58.361 --> 01:10:00.728
Once again,
it's really, really important

01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:04.332
that Fneep gets that star!

01:10:05.435 --> 01:10:08.803
Whether I like it
or not,

01:10:08.805 --> 01:10:11.806
you were not born
to stay in this nest.

01:10:11.808 --> 01:10:15.677
And whether I understand it
or not,

01:10:15.679 --> 01:10:18.279
you were born for the sky.

01:10:18.281 --> 01:10:21.816
Yes! Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

01:10:21.818 --> 01:10:23.551
Thank you!

01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:29.958
Just hold on to this thing.
I'll get you to Fneep.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:31.960
Yes, sir, ma'am, sir!

01:10:35.899 --> 01:10:37.932
I'm gonna fly, Mama.

01:10:37.934 --> 01:10:42.270
Yes, you are, dear.
Yes, you are.

01:10:45.775 --> 01:10:47.809
Wow.

01:11:07.264 --> 01:11:11.032
Oh, no!

01:11:11.034 --> 01:11:14.936
Hold on!

01:11:58.581 --> 01:12:00.515
Whoa!

01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:02.450
Whoa!

01:12:04.854 --> 01:12:06.954
Enough!

01:12:15.031 --> 01:12:18.666
You know,
now seems like a good time

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:21.336
for an intimidating speech.

01:12:21.338 --> 01:12:24.906
Something to put the fear
of Scaldron into you.

01:12:24.908 --> 01:12:29.711
Something to really let you know
how badly you've lost.

01:12:29.713 --> 01:12:32.914
Let me see.

01:12:32.916 --> 01:12:34.515
Stampede.

01:12:34.517 --> 01:12:35.950
What? What is it?

01:12:35.952 --> 01:12:39.454
- Stampede.
- Stampede?

01:12:39.456 --> 01:12:40.922
What?

01:12:48.832 --> 01:12:53.968
Furry... and with a tail!

01:13:02.379 --> 01:13:04.912
- Stampede!
- No! No! No! No!

01:13:04.914 --> 01:13:11.085
- I'm Grogon the...
- Stampe-e-e-ede.

01:13:16.693 --> 01:13:19.861
Special delivery for Fneep.

01:13:22.665 --> 01:13:23.998
Hah!

01:13:29.606 --> 01:13:31.406
Huh!

01:13:34.577 --> 01:13:38.646
Oh, uh... Hey-hey, chaps.

01:13:38.648 --> 01:13:40.715
Ever read point 65,
sub-section 12

01:13:40.717 --> 01:13:42.917
of the user manual?

01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:46.170
- Huh?
- Hm...

01:13:46.172 --> 01:13:48.723
About how to distract someone
so they don't see what's coming?

01:14:09.979 --> 01:14:11.779
Huh? Uh-oh!

01:14:21.157 --> 01:14:22.623
Oh!

01:14:32.001 --> 01:14:35.002
Oh! Flying!

01:14:41.077 --> 01:14:42.810
Huh?!

01:14:42.812 --> 01:14:44.745
Fneep!

01:14:44.747 --> 01:14:46.981
Have you ever read point 65,

01:14:46.983 --> 01:14:49.884
sub-section 12
of the user manual?

01:14:49.886 --> 01:14:52.787
Yeah, about how
to distract someone while...

01:14:52.789 --> 01:14:58.659
- Oh, dear.
- Never fails.

01:15:02.599 --> 01:15:06.100
Oh, no! That's the wrong colour.

01:15:19.549 --> 01:15:25.987
There it is, Fneep.
One thousand planets.

01:15:25.989 --> 01:15:29.123
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

01:15:29.125 --> 01:15:32.093
Your star may be in the sky

01:15:32.095 --> 01:15:34.262
but you've not
conquered the animals yet.

01:15:34.264 --> 01:15:37.265
Ha! Judging
by this lot, that'll be easy.

01:15:37.267 --> 01:15:40.301
You may think so,
but they have a secret weapon.

01:15:40.303 --> 01:15:44.972
A-ha! Of course!
Our secret... weapon?

01:15:44.974 --> 01:15:47.108
What's our secret weapon?

01:15:48.845 --> 01:15:50.144
Something more powerful

01:15:50.146 --> 01:15:52.647
than anything
I've ever witnessed.

01:15:52.649 --> 01:15:54.916
- More powerful than...
- Yes!

01:15:54.918 --> 01:15:58.185
More powerful than
the Power Bolt of Gustagoriopia!

01:15:58.187 --> 01:16:00.721
- Even more powerful than...
- Yes!

01:16:00.723 --> 01:16:03.958
Even more powerful than
the Blinding Eye of Mezmorio!

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:04.959
- More...
- Yes!

01:16:04.961 --> 01:16:08.829
- Mo...
- Yes! Yes!

01:16:08.831 --> 01:16:10.231
And here it is.

01:16:19.976 --> 01:16:23.077
What is it? Get it off!
Get it off! Get it off!

01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:27.281
It's a hug.

01:16:28.618 --> 01:16:30.751
You're my father,
and I love you.

01:16:35.592 --> 01:16:36.724
What's happening?

01:16:36.726 --> 01:16:40.695
Don't worry, you'll be OK.

01:16:40.697 --> 01:16:45.700
What are you doing to me?

01:16:45.702 --> 01:16:48.202
I'm making you feel special.

01:17:08.758 --> 01:17:12.093
- That's it.
- Huh? What?

01:17:12.095 --> 01:17:13.861
What are you looking at?

01:17:13.863 --> 01:17:15.663
You've never had a hug before.

01:17:15.665 --> 01:17:17.898
Hugs! Who needs hugs?

01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:22.203
Stupid, soft, mooshy.
Wh-Wh-What are you doing?

01:17:22.205 --> 01:17:24.405
That's why
you're always so grumpy.

01:17:24.407 --> 01:17:27.141
Nonsense! What are you doing?

01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:29.644
Oh, you know you want one.

01:17:29.646 --> 01:17:31.178
Step away from the hedgehog!

01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:35.349
All along
you just needed...

01:17:37.186 --> 01:17:39.353
OK, let me just...

01:17:39.355 --> 01:17:40.688
Ha! You see.

01:17:40.690 --> 01:17:43.791
No touchy,
no huggy the spiky man.

01:17:48.698 --> 01:17:52.800
- I... I feel...
- Warm and fuzzy?

01:17:52.802 --> 01:17:55.169
- Yes.
- Special?

01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:59.173
Yes! You must all feel this!

01:18:15.425 --> 01:18:18.359
Ground, ground,
ground, ground...

01:18:18.361 --> 01:18:20.428
Oh!

01:18:22.799 --> 01:18:24.999
Ground,
ground, ground...

01:18:36.813 --> 01:18:40.114
See? I told you I could fly!

01:18:40.116 --> 01:18:41.482
Yeah!

01:18:45.988 --> 01:18:48.122
Whoo-hoo!

01:19:08.010 --> 01:19:10.978
It's all yours.

01:19:14.517 --> 01:19:16.050
I can't do this.

01:19:16.052 --> 01:19:19.320
This planet belongs
to all of you, not me.

01:19:19.322 --> 01:19:22.389
Yeah, but I wanna see
some fireworks!

01:19:22.391 --> 01:19:26.260
OK. But I'm doing it my way.

01:19:28.431 --> 01:19:31.398
- Say "Fneep!"
- You don't tell me what to say.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:33.901
- You don't have to.
- I'll say it.

01:19:33.903 --> 01:19:38.072
I'll say the heck out of it!
Fffne-e-e-ep!

01:19:39.408 --> 01:19:43.177
Ah, was I blinking?
I think I blinked.

01:19:49.852 --> 01:19:52.186
- Oh!
- Way to go!

01:19:52.188 --> 01:19:54.789
- I am so proud of you.
- Thanks, guys.

01:19:54.791 --> 01:19:57.024
Come here.

01:19:57.026 --> 01:20:00.995
I couldn't have done it
without you, you know.

01:20:02.932 --> 01:20:05.166
Time to go home, son.

01:20:05.168 --> 01:20:07.535
Aren't we going to get
your thousandth planet?

01:20:07.537 --> 01:20:10.437
But of course.
I have just the planet in mind,

01:20:10.439 --> 01:20:12.907
and you can help me conquer it.

01:20:12.909 --> 01:20:15.176
- Scaldron.
- Our planet?

01:20:15.178 --> 01:20:17.978
Yes, I have a new secret weapon,

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:21.515
which I think
our own people could use.

01:20:21.517 --> 01:20:26.086
Hug. Hug, hug, hugging.

01:20:26.088 --> 01:20:28.322
I can never repay you all
properly,

01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:30.291
but... here, you can have this.

01:20:30.293 --> 01:20:32.893
- Peach!
- No!

01:20:32.895 --> 01:20:35.095
- Hm.
- I'm going to miss you.

01:20:35.097 --> 01:20:36.831
- No, I'm not!
- What?

01:20:36.833 --> 01:20:39.567
- Exactly!
- Right. Yeah.

01:20:39.569 --> 01:20:41.569
Baby Ostrich
already has her present.

01:20:41.571 --> 01:20:44.238
Whee!

01:20:46.375 --> 01:20:48.876
Kids.

01:20:48.878 --> 01:20:52.012
And Rocky.

01:20:52.014 --> 01:20:54.949
Flying!

01:20:54.951 --> 01:20:58.619
And you, my furry friend,
you've done so much for me.

01:20:58.621 --> 01:21:02.122
What can I do for you?

01:21:03.426 --> 01:21:08.362
Well, maybe there is...
