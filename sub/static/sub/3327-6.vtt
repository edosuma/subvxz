WEBVTT

00:03.400 --> 00:05.391
(garbled, overlapping
radio transmissions blaring)

00:16.110 --> 00:18.442
(garbled, overlapping
radio transmissions continue)

00:20.480 --> 00:21.640
Too loud?

00:22.490 --> 00:23.616
Sorry.

00:23.650 --> 00:25.379
I went downstairs
to get some cereal.

00:25.420 --> 00:26.512
Didn't want to miss anything.

00:27.820 --> 00:29.424
This city has

00:29.460 --> 00:30.688
excellent scanner apps,

00:30.730 --> 00:32.459
but there's nothing
like the tactility

00:32.500 --> 00:36.561
of the original devices--
all those dials and buttons.

00:36.600 --> 00:39.467
You like pushing buttons;
I'm stunned.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.695
You've been glued to these
for the last few days.

00:41.740 --> 00:43.332
It's a slow week.

00:43.370 --> 00:45.235
At least in regards
to murder and mayhem.

00:45.270 --> 00:46.771
Captain Gregson
hasn't called once.

00:46.810 --> 00:48.437
Maybe some lunatic will

00:48.480 --> 00:50.277
put his mother-in-law
in the wood chipper,

00:50.310 --> 00:51.504
give you something
to do today.

00:53.650 --> 00:55.811
Uh, I need to talk
to you about something.

00:55.850 --> 00:57.579
That's never good.

00:57.620 --> 00:58.814
Your father
e-mailed me last night

00:58.850 --> 01:00.283
before I went to bed.

01:00.320 --> 01:01.287
He's coming into town
for business.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.526
Wants to have dinner.

01:02.560 --> 01:04.653
(chuckles)

01:04.690 --> 01:05.657
What's so funny?

01:05.690 --> 01:06.657
Him.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.827
Dinner. Us.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.225
You.

01:11.430 --> 01:12.533
Remind me, Watson:
how many times

01:12.570 --> 01:13.468
have you actually met the man?

01:13.500 --> 01:15.331
Neven

01:15.370 --> 01:16.507
That's because _
he secured your servrces

01:16.540 --> 01:17.734
as my sober companion
electronically.

01:17.770 --> 01:19.169
Yeah, but...
And all of your

01:19.210 --> 01:20.734
subsequent correspondence
has been

01:20.780 --> 01:22.441
via e-mail or through one of his
legion of personal assistants.

01:22.480 --> 01:25.108
_ So?
So, take It from someone

01:25.150 --> 01:27.573
who has spent incrementally
more time with him than you:

01:27.620 --> 01:29.815
he has zero intention of meeting
us for dinner this evening.

01:29.850 --> 01:31.181
What are you talking about?

01:31.220 --> 01:32.619
Shh!

01:32.660 --> 01:33.649
WOMAN (over radio):
...at Beach 17 Street.

01:33.690 --> 01:35.555
10-4, multiple units responding.

01:35.590 --> 01:40.220
GREGSON: Detective, Captain,
show me 84 at the scene, over.

01:40.260 --> 01:41.557
What is it?
Get dressed. We're leaving.

01:43.300 --> 01:46.497
Do you want to tell me
what you just heard?

01:46.540 --> 01:49.464
"10-66."
Code for "unusual incident."

01:49.510 --> 01:51.535
It can mean _
one of only three things.

01:51.570 --> 01:53.538
Location of the incident--
Far Rockaway Beach--

01:53.580 --> 01:55.502
indicates it's neither
a train colhsnon

01:55.540 --> 01:58.646
nor a building collapse, which
leaves only one possibility.

01:59.750 --> 02:01.615
Plane crash.

02:01.650 --> 02:04.141
I didn't realize you also
investigated accidents?

02:04.190 --> 02:05.839
We need to find
Captain Gregson.

02:05.890 --> 02:07.187
He 84'd on
the scanner.

02:07.220 --> 02:08.619
I heard his voice.

02:08.660 --> 02:10.924
"84" is confirmation he
had arrived on the scene.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.552
What are you doing here?

02:12.600 --> 02:13.828
I heard what happened
on the scanner;

02:13.860 --> 02:15.657
I thought I might be able
to be of assistance.

02:15.700 --> 02:17.565
This isn't a crime scene,
it's a crash site.

02:17.600 --> 02:18.862
I'm a jack-of-
many-trades.

02:18.900 --> 02:20.868
When it comes _to aviation
and air accrdents,

02:20.900 --> 02:23.368
I'm something of an expert.

02:23.410 --> 02:25.560
Good to know, but we've already
got all the experts we need.

02:25.610 --> 02:27.202
This is their scene, not mine.

02:27.240 --> 02:28.832
Department's just here
to lend a hand.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.677
Captain Gregson?

02:30.710 --> 02:31.779
Yeah?

02:31.810 --> 02:33.311
Some of our loolq-loos
are getting

02:33.350 --> 02:34.544
a little too
close for comfort.

02:34.580 --> 02:35.649
Sergeant, you hear that?

02:35.680 --> 02:36.840
Excuse me, Miss, uh...

02:36.890 --> 02:38.539
Molinari.

02:38.590 --> 02:39.852
What exactly
are we looking at?

02:39.890 --> 02:41.517
Engine failure?
Bird strike?

02:41.560 --> 02:42.686
Fatigued wing spar?

02:43.690 --> 02:44.657
Ms. Molinari, uh,

02:44.690 --> 02:46.191
this is, uh,
Sherlock Holmes.

02:46.230 --> 02:47.549
He's a consultant
with the NYPD.

02:47.600 --> 02:48.794
Miss Watson.

02:48.830 --> 02:51.663
You have a consultant
for plane crashes?

02:51.700 --> 02:53.736
No, he's...

02:53.770 --> 02:55.658
A specialist in the field
of deductive reasoning.

02:55.700 --> 02:57.361
And unraveling
the complex chain of events

02:57.410 --> 02:59.708
that can turn a triumph
of human innovation

02:59.740 --> 03:01.207
into a smoldering pile

03:01.240 --> 03:03.242
of wreckage in seconds--

03:03.280 --> 03:04.645
well, I can't think of

03:04.680 --> 03:07.274
a more compelling
application than that.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.641
Well, thank you
for the offer, Mr. Holmes,

03:09.690 --> 03:11.339
but I think
we have things covered.

03:13.390 --> 03:15.255
Go home, okay?

03:15.290 --> 03:17.656
If you really need something
to do, I'll send you

03:17.690 --> 03:19.897
some cold case
files when I get...

03:19.930 --> 03:21.591
back to the precinct.

03:21.630 --> 03:23.621
Holmes!

03:39.650 --> 03:41.538
How many of the passengers
were attorneys?

03:41.580 --> 03:42.547
All of them.

03:42.590 --> 03:43.682
How did you...?

03:43.720 --> 03:45.278
The toiletry kit.

03:45.320 --> 03:46.617
It's emblazoned with
the logo "VeriScript."

03:46.660 --> 03:49.288
That's a court reporting company

03:49.330 --> 03:50.649
hired to
transcribe depositions.

03:50.690 --> 03:51.952
Obviously given
to the lawyers

03:51.990 --> 03:53.651
as some sort _of
promotional gift,

03:53.700 --> 03:54.894
help drum up business.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.666
This man's leg was nearly

03:57.700 --> 03:59.565
amputated by a piece
of fuselage,

03:59.600 --> 04:02.364
yet there's virtually
no evidence of blood loss

04:02.410 --> 04:03.866
on his pants.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.366
Laceration like that

04:05.410 --> 04:06.638
while his heart
was still pumping,

04:06.680 --> 04:08.477
_that'd make
qurte a mess, no?

04:08.510 --> 04:09.579
To put it mildly.

04:09.610 --> 04:10.702
Blunt force trauma

04:10.750 --> 04:12.638
on the back of his head.

04:12.680 --> 04:14.477
It's a nasty one at that.

04:14.520 --> 04:17.819
Someone caved his skull in
before the plane hit the ground.

04:17.850 --> 04:21.559
This man didn't die
in a plane crash...

04:21.590 --> 04:24.753
he was murdered.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.661
Note the distinctive shape
of the wound, the depth,

04:33.700 --> 04:36.601
the severity of damage
to the bone, gray matter.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.403
The murder weapon
wasn't just heavy,

04:38.440 --> 04:41.637
it had two prongs
at the tip.

04:41.680 --> 04:42.647
A wrench?

04:42.680 --> 04:44.602
Large one.

04:44.650 --> 04:46.003
Blow would've
killed him instantly.

04:46.050 --> 04:47.415
Has the, uh,
has the voice recorder

04:47.450 --> 04:48.678
been recovered
from the cockpit?

04:48.720 --> 04:51.587
Not yet.

04:51.620 --> 04:54.589
Any eyewitness accounts
of the crash?

04:54.620 --> 04:56.326
One, a jogger.

04:56.360 --> 04:58.351
She said that the plane
was gaining altitude

04:58.390 --> 05:00.620
when the nose suddenly
went straight up.

05:00.660 --> 05:04.892
It climbed like that for
a while, then shuddered,

05:04.930 --> 05:07.034
tipped to the right and
went into a tailspin.

05:07.070 --> 05:11.564
I was thinking wake turbulence
or elevator control failure.

05:11.610 --> 05:12.838
Hmm.

05:12.880 --> 05:13.699
Might want to add

05:13.740 --> 05:16.538
"wrench-wielding
madman" to that list.

05:16.580 --> 05:18.343
The passengers
were all attorneys

05:18.380 --> 05:19.916
with the same
white shoe firm.

05:19.950 --> 05:21.975
Two men, one woman.

05:22.020 --> 05:23.942
The odds of one of them
attacking the other

05:23.990 --> 05:25.946
in the back of this small
plane with a wrench...

05:25.990 --> 05:28.413
You can see how that might be
distracting to a pilot, no?

05:28.460 --> 05:29.586
Hmm?

05:29.630 --> 05:32.622
Unless the pilot was the killer.

05:32.660 --> 05:35.026
You're saying that the pilot
got up from his controls

05:35.060 --> 05:36.596
to attack a passenger?

05:36.630 --> 05:38.063
Drivers get road rage.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.692
Can a pilot get air rage?

05:39.740 --> 05:41.037
GREGSON: _Would
you come With me?

05:41.070 --> 05:43.334
Let's talk logistics.

05:47.580 --> 05:48.638
Did you find something?

05:48.680 --> 05:50.568
Sand.

05:51.510 --> 05:52.772
Well, yeah...

05:52.820 --> 05:55.812
th-these granules
aren't frosted.

05:55.850 --> 05:59.809
Natural sand is,
um, it's smoother, weathered.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.714
The city must have
trucked in new sand

06:01.760 --> 06:03.455
to offset the erosion
on the beach.

06:03.490 --> 06:04.787
Are you okay?

06:04.830 --> 06:06.957
You seem a little off,
even for you.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.956
Four people are dead,
Watson.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.627
I'm just trying
to do my part.

06:10.670 --> 06:12.638
I get it,
but whoever killed that attorney

06:12.670 --> 06:14.467
must have died in that crash,
too, right?

06:14.500 --> 06:16.468
Obviously.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.637
Well, then if there's
no killer on the loose,

06:18.670 --> 06:20.934
I just, I don't understand
why you're sticking around.

06:20.980 --> 06:23.540
Because the killer
hasn't been identified yet.

06:23.580 --> 06:24.899
We have three suspects.

06:24.950 --> 06:26.144
Dead, alive, doesn't matter.

06:26.180 --> 06:27.977
Two of them
are innocent of the crime.

06:28.020 --> 06:30.989
Don't you think we owe it to
their loved ones to prove that?

06:31.020 --> 06:32.658
Absolutely, but all the police
have to do

06:32.690 --> 06:33.987
is find the murder weapon.

06:34.020 --> 06:35.419
Then they can
compare fingerprints.

06:35.460 --> 06:36.859
What if they don't find it?
VVhatthen?

06:36.890 --> 06:38.050
Hmm?

06:38.090 --> 06:39.990
Also, the killer
committed a murder

06:40.030 --> 06:42.191
on a very small plane
with a very large wrench.

06:42.230 --> 06:43.822
Now, if the crime
was spur-of—the-moment,

06:43.870 --> 06:45.599
what was the wrench
dorng there, hmm?

06:45.630 --> 06:48.030
If it was premeditated,
what was the killer thinking?

06:48.070 --> 06:49.606
He-- or she-- waited

06:49.640 --> 06:51.164
until they were in
an extremely confined space

06:51.210 --> 06:53.098
with their
would-be victim

06:53.140 --> 06:53.970
and two witnesses. Hmm?

06:54.010 --> 06:56.444
That seems like
a strange tIme and place

06:56.480 --> 06:58.004
to commit a violent homicide,

06:58.050 --> 06:59.608
wouldn't you agree?

06:59.650 --> 07:01.049
It's just...

07:01.080 --> 07:02.911
there's a story here, Watson.

07:02.950 --> 07:04.611
And we can help tell it.

07:04.650 --> 07:06.584
Or do we just need
to stay busy enough

07:06.620 --> 07:08.451
to miss dinner with your father?

07:08.490 --> 07:11.687
So, CSU's en route
to process the scene.

07:11.730 --> 07:14.995
NTSB will work their crash,
and we'll work our murder.

07:15.030 --> 07:16.861
IfI may make a suggestion,
Captain.

07:16.900 --> 07:18.219
We start by
speaking with the people

07:18.270 --> 07:20.591
who were the last
to have seen the victims alive.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.608
Good idea.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.005
MAN:
Joe and I were

07:24.040 --> 07:27.976
friends for over 20 years.

07:28.010 --> 07:30.001
This would be Joe
Newell, the pilot?

07:30.050 --> 07:31.779
Yeah.

07:31.810 --> 07:34.938
Were you very familiar
with the passengers?

07:34.980 --> 07:37.187
Walter Devlin flew with us
qurte a bIt.

07:37.220 --> 07:39.814
But that was
mostly for cases

07:39.860 --> 07:41.680
that he or his law firm
were taking on.

07:41.720 --> 07:43.824
What about his associates?

07:43.860 --> 07:45.157
Uh, Hank Gerrard
and Ellie Wilson?

07:45.190 --> 07:47.249
Yeah, they accompanied him
once or twice,

07:47.300 --> 07:49.256
but I never
actually met them.

07:49.300 --> 07:51.120
You weren't at the airstrip when
the plane took off this morning?

07:51.170 --> 07:53.092
I own the company,
I don't fly the planes.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.096
So I'm not always there
when they take off.

07:55.140 --> 07:58.906
Your friend, Joe-- was
he an irascible type?

07:58.940 --> 08:00.874
Short-tempered?
No.

08:00.910 --> 08:02.070
He's ex-military.

08:02.110 --> 08:03.202
Joe didn't have a temper.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.206
GREGSON:
We have reason to believe

08:05.250 --> 08:07.639
that there was an incident
shortly after takeoff.

08:07.680 --> 08:11.081
Uh, Hank Gerrard may
have been attacked.

08:11.120 --> 08:12.587
I don't understand.
And you think that's

08:12.620 --> 08:14.053
what might have
brought down the plane?

08:14.090 --> 08:15.250
We're waiting
for the NTSB

08:15.290 --> 08:17.178
to _make their
ofﬁcral report.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.822
(sighs)

08:18.860 --> 08:20.623
Look, I don't know
how much help it'd be,

08:20.660 --> 08:23.197
but we put a security camera
in the parking area last year

08:23.230 --> 08:25.061
after a couple cars
were broken into.

08:25.100 --> 08:27.068
You might be able to see
the passengers arriving.

08:27.100 --> 08:29.068
We'll take it, definitely.

08:29.100 --> 08:31.068
MAN:
But as far as Joe goes,

08:31.110 --> 08:34.637
all I can tell you is he was
as good a man as he was a pilot,

08:34.680 --> 08:36.739
and he never had one problem
with any passenger.

08:36.780 --> 08:39.817
So, if Mr. Gerrard
was attacked,

08:39.850 --> 08:42.171
Joe wasn't the guy who did it.

08:42.220 --> 08:43.949
Learn anything?

08:43.990 --> 08:46.914
Only that the pilot's boss
thought very highly of him.

08:46.960 --> 08:50.623
Doesn't mean he didn't go mental
on a passenger, mind you.

08:50.660 --> 08:53.094
I just got an e-mail from
your dad's personal secretary.

08:53.130 --> 08:54.859
Ah, told you he'd back out.

08:54.900 --> 08:56.151
Actually, he
was wondering

08:56.200 --> 08:58.327
if we could do dinner
at Lure at 6:00.

08:58.370 --> 08:59.997
(chuckles)

09:00.040 --> 09:01.234
Look, I know you
have your issues,

09:01.270 --> 09:02.669
but I think it's
important that we go.

09:02.710 --> 09:03.699
Of course you do.

09:03.740 --> 09:04.900
He's signing your checks.

09:04.940 --> 09:06.168
Remind me,
how are you

09:06.210 --> 09:07.302
paying for the
brownstone again?

09:09.210 --> 09:11.201
He obviously
cares about you.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.309
If he didn't, he would not
have put you through rehab

09:13.350 --> 09:16.012
and he certainly would not have
hired me to work with you.

09:16.050 --> 09:18.314
I'm about to disabuse you
of several notions,

09:18.350 --> 09:20.079
so please listen very carefully.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.849
One: my father
does not care about me.

09:21.890 --> 09:24.256
He does what he does out of
a sense of familial obligations.

09:24.290 --> 09:25.325
Big difference.

09:25.360 --> 09:27.294
Two: he does not
care about you

09:27.330 --> 09:28.592
or what you think.

09:28.630 --> 09:30.120
Meeting you would be
a formality.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.922
And three:
as I've already told you,

09:31.970 --> 09:33.733
your concern is unwarranted,
'cause he has absolutely

09:33.770 --> 09:35.192
no_intention _
of showmg up tonight.

09:35.240 --> 09:37.231
How could you
possibly know that?

09:37.270 --> 09:39.033
Because he is a serial absentee.

09:39.070 --> 09:42.198
A pathological maker
and breaker of promises.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.071
Been that way since I was a boy.

09:44.110 --> 09:45.338
Fool me once, shame on you.

09:45.380 --> 09:46.870
Fool me ad nauseam...

09:46.920 --> 09:48.148
Holmes.

09:48.180 --> 09:50.284
Got something for you
and the captain.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.982
Captain, just got
off the phone with

09:53.020 --> 09:55.818
one of the junior partners
at Walter Devlin's firm.

09:55.860 --> 09:57.919
He said that Devlin, Hank
Gerrard and Ellie Wilson

09:57.960 --> 10:00.121
were headed to a retreat in
Martha's Vineyard to work on

10:00.160 --> 10:03.323
a class action case against a
company called Carmanto Foods.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.894
There were allegations
that the company's

10:04.930 --> 10:06.090
sugar substitute causes cancer.

10:06.130 --> 10:07.290
Plaintiffs were seeking damages

10:07.340 --> 10:09.228
in the neighborhood
of a hundred mil.

10:09.270 --> 10:10.760
Seems there was a
lot of infighting

10:10.810 --> 10:13.108
among our three dead lawyers
about how to proceed.

10:13.140 --> 10:16.075
Anyone particularly angry with
the murder victim, Hank Gerrard?

10:16.110 --> 10:17.338
As a matter of fact, yeah.

10:17.380 --> 10:18.745
He was butting heads
with his boss,

10:18.780 --> 10:20.247
Walter Devlin.

10:20.280 --> 10:21.645
Devlin's inclination
was to settle,

10:21.680 --> 10:23.181
Gerrard's was to
keep fighting.

10:23.220 --> 10:24.949
They'd had a few loud
arguments at the office.

10:24.990 --> 10:26.855
Guy I spoke to thought
Gerrard was gonna get fired

10:26.890 --> 10:28.209
if he didn't
back down.

10:28.260 --> 10:30.683
Sounds like we've got
our primary suspect.

10:30.730 --> 10:33.153
Still doesn't explain why the
head of a successful law firm

10:33.200 --> 10:35.293
would've brought a wrench
aboard a small aircraft.

10:35.330 --> 10:36.399
(cell phone vibrating)
It's possible

10:36.430 --> 10:37.863
we're about to find out.

10:37.900 --> 10:40.334
Ms. Molinari of the NTSB.

10:40.370 --> 10:42.258
They just found
the plane's black box.

10:44.310 --> 10:48.201
(radio static crackles
on recording)

10:48.240 --> 10:49.798
MAN: Key Star two eight three
hotel foxtrot,

10:49.850 --> 10:50.805
state your position.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.306
Air traffic control.

10:52.350 --> 10:54.318
MAN 2: Key Star two eight three
hotel foxtrot...

10:54.350 --> 10:55.817
That's the pilot, Joe Newell.

10:55.850 --> 10:57.147
...endurance 90 minutes.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.384
MAN:
Thank you, Key Star.

10:58.420 --> 10:59.819
You're clear to climb to 3,400.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.282
DEVLIN:
I made you, Hank.

11:01.320 --> 11:02.924
Took you in and built you up
from nothing.

11:02.960 --> 11:04.689
And now you pull
a stunt like this?

11:04.730 --> 11:08.052
You think I'm gonna let it
slide? Guess again.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.068
WILSON:
Calm down, Walter.

11:10.100 --> 11:12.227
Walter Devlin,
Ellie Wilson.

11:12.270 --> 11:15.034
Let the pilot do his job.
Come back here, we'll do ours.

11:15.070 --> 11:17.061
PILOT JOE: Key Star to ATC,
what's my best vector?

11:17.110 --> 11:18.407
DEVLIN:
You cannot protect Hank,
Ellie; not from me.

11:18.440 --> 11:20.237
(alarm beeping in plane)

11:20.280 --> 11:23.272
What the hell, what the hell's
going on back there?!

11:23.310 --> 11:25.346
PILOT JOE: Damn! Get it down.
Get it down! What is it?!

11:25.380 --> 11:28.247
Key Star to ATC,
we have an emergency. Oh, God.

11:28.280 --> 11:32.819
CONTROLLER:
ATC to Key Star: Are you able
to maintain altitude?

11:32.860 --> 11:33.952
PILOT JOE:
That's a negative.

11:33.990 --> 11:36.788
(plane whining)

11:36.830 --> 11:39.048
Brace! Brace!

11:39.090 --> 11:41.229
(transmission crackles,
cuts out)

11:41.260 --> 11:44.093
I can't believe it, but it
sounds like you were right.

11:44.130 --> 11:47.099
No, I was mistaken.
There wasn't any fight.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.391
But you can hear...

11:48.440 --> 11:50.408
An entirely one-sided argument.

11:50.440 --> 11:51.839
Mr. Gerrard
never says a word.

11:51.870 --> 11:53.804
But the junior partner
that you spoke with

11:53.840 --> 11:56.229
said that he and Devlin were
prone to loud disagreements.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.339
Yet this morning, Hank Gerrard
doesn't even get

11:58.380 --> 11:59.938
a syllable in edgeways.
Also I'm assuming

11:59.980 --> 12:01.311
that if your people
had found

12:01.350 --> 12:03.841
a murder weapon by now,
you would have told us.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.039
It seems strange,
given that

12:05.090 --> 12:07.217
every other
piece of debris

12:07.260 --> 12:08.318
seems to have
been accounted for.

12:08.360 --> 12:09.884
Could've ended up in
the water.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.454
Well, nothing else seemed to.

12:11.490 --> 12:13.355
Okay, how do you explain
the pilot's initial exchange

12:13.400 --> 12:15.049
with air traffic control?

12:15.100 --> 12:16.829
He says, and I quote,
"Three souls aboard."

12:16.870 --> 12:18.189
Three. Not four.

12:18.230 --> 12:20.289
He could have meant
three passengers.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.433
Pilots often don't include
themselves in the count.

12:22.470 --> 12:24.335
I believe this one did.
What are you saying?

12:24.370 --> 12:27.498
That he didn't know Hank Gerrard
was in the cabin?

12:27.540 --> 12:30.077
I'm saying Hank Gerrard
wasn't in the cabin.

12:30.110 --> 12:32.340
But that's impossible.
His body was in the wreckage.

12:32.380 --> 12:33.540
Allow me, if you will,

12:33.580 --> 12:35.218
another interpretation
of the evidence.

12:35.250 --> 12:38.117
Hank Gerrard wasn't
killed on the plane,

12:38.150 --> 12:40.857
he was killed elsewhere, and
earlier in the morning.

12:40.890 --> 12:43.381
It would explain why the
wrench hasn't turned up,

12:43.430 --> 12:44.920
'cause it wasn't on
the plane.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.258
Because the crime scene,
crash site,

12:47.300 --> 12:50.360
two entirely
different places, hmm?

12:50.400 --> 12:52.061
The killer bludgeoned

12:52.100 --> 12:54.034
Mr. Gerrard, then, for reasons

12:54.070 --> 12:57.369
yet to be determined,
conceals his body in
the cargo hold.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.139
Mr. Devlin, he just assumes

12:59.170 --> 13:01.274
that Gerrard has missed
the flight,

13:01.310 --> 13:03.107
so he calls his absentee
colleague

13:03.150 --> 13:04.503
to scold him.

13:04.550 --> 13:06.506
That's would explain why

13:06.550 --> 13:08.347
you don't hear Gerrard's
voice on the recording,

13:08.380 --> 13:10.018
'cause D_evlin's tirade
was a vorce message.

13:10.050 --> 13:11.142
Now Ms. Wilson, she tries
to calm Devlin.

13:11.190 --> 13:13.317
She leads him
towards the back

13:13.360 --> 13:15.055
of the plane.

13:15.090 --> 13:16.284
Now, neither of them knows
there's a 200-pound corpse

13:16.320 --> 13:18.026
just inches below
their feet.

13:18.060 --> 13:20.358
The sudden weight imbalance
threw the plane into a dive.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.868
Did you recover Mr.
Gerrard's cell phone?

13:22.900 --> 13:24.868
Yes, but it's damaged.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.337
May I?

13:38.050 --> 13:40.348
If I'm right...

13:40.380 --> 13:43.213
he'll have a new voicemail.

13:43.250 --> 13:44.512
DEVLIN:
I made you, Hank.

13:44.550 --> 13:46.609
Took you in
and built you up from nothing.

13:46.650 --> 13:48.413
Now you pull a stunt like this?

13:48.460 --> 13:52.157
You think I'm gonna let it
slide? Guess again.

13:52.190 --> 13:54.397
Mr. Devlin and Ms. Wilson did
not kill Hank Gerrard;

13:54.430 --> 13:56.159
they didn't even
know where he was.

13:56.200 --> 13:59.465
Joe Newell,
an experienced pilot,

13:59.500 --> 14:01.468
would've known better than
to stash the extra weight

14:01.500 --> 14:04.264
of his body in the cargo hold
and risk exactly

14:04.310 --> 14:05.959
the kind of
accident that occurred.

14:06.010 --> 14:07.500
They may be dead,

14:07.540 --> 14:10.441
but the person who killed
Hank Gerrard is not.

14:10.480 --> 14:13.517
We have a living, breathing
murderer to find after all.

14:17.990 --> 14:20.481
What was the killer thinking?
Why stuff Gerrard's body

14:20.520 --> 14:23.080
in the hold of the plane,
like so much luggage?

14:23.130 --> 14:24.927
Surely he knew it
would be discovered

14:24.960 --> 14:26.621
when the plane
reached Martha's Vineyard.

14:26.660 --> 14:29.458
Did he want it found?
If yes, why?

14:29.500 --> 14:32.264
Was it intended
as some sort of message?

14:32.300 --> 14:33.437
If so, to whom?

14:33.470 --> 14:35.563
Can I ask you a question?

14:35.600 --> 14:37.238
Can I stop you?

14:37.270 --> 14:39.306
Are you afraid of flying?

14:41.180 --> 14:42.943
It's just you
pursuing this case

14:42.980 --> 14:44.402
didn't make sense
to me at first.

14:44.450 --> 14:46.600
As far as you knew,
it was just an accident.

14:46.650 --> 14:48.618
But then at the
crash site this morning,

14:48.650 --> 14:50.140
you weren't yourself.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.316
"Myself"?

14:51.350 --> 14:54.148
You got distracted
by sand on a beach.

14:54.190 --> 14:56.215
And look at that board.

14:56.260 --> 14:57.989
Normally, you would
have put up every picture

14:58.030 --> 14:59.258
you had from the
crash site.

14:59.290 --> 15:01.053
But instead, there's
just images of what

15:01.100 --> 15:02.226
the plane used to
lookae.

15:02.260 --> 15:03.568
I've already examined
those pictures,

15:03.600 --> 15:05.227
and they yielded nothing.

15:05.270 --> 15:06.521
Now since you're
a disgraced ex-surgeon

15:06.570 --> 15:08.231
and not a disgraced
ex-psychologist,

15:08.270 --> 15:10.534
what say you stop
analyzing me, okay?

15:10.570 --> 15:13.130
How did you get
from London to New York?

15:15.380 --> 15:19.339
Okay, well, maybe your father
will tell me at dinner tonight.

15:19.380 --> 15:20.142
(knocking on glass)
Hey.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.273
Just got the phone
with the owner

15:22.320 --> 15:23.685
of Key Star Charters,
Charles Cooper.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.585
They got the footage from
their security camera.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.952
He said there's something on it
we should see.

15:31.330 --> 15:35.994
COOPER:
So, this is about 45 minutes
before the plane took off.

15:36.030 --> 15:37.998
That's Mr. Gerrard.

15:38.030 --> 15:41.090
I don't know who
this other guy is, but

15:41.140 --> 15:43.301
obviously, he and Mr. Gerrard
had words.

15:43.340 --> 15:45.968
It's the model glue,
isn't it?

15:46.010 --> 15:48.069
It's murder on my senses.

15:48.110 --> 15:51.170
Not to mention I'm under
strict orders not to get high.

15:51.210 --> 15:53.349
This office is like
one big huffing bag.

15:53.380 --> 15:55.314
COOPER:
Ten minutes later,
he leaves alone.

15:55.350 --> 15:58.979
So now we know Mr. Gerrard
arrived here alive and intact.

15:59.020 --> 16:00.556
Gotta figure he was
killed here, too.

16:00.590 --> 16:02.285
You got this from any
other angles?

16:02.320 --> 16:05.721
Eh, sorry. Only other camera
got broke a few weeks ago.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.227
Hasn't been fixed yet.

16:07.260 --> 16:09.353
Mr. Cooper, I'm gonna
need you and Mister...

16:09.400 --> 16:11.197
Barts.
...Barts to clear out
of here for a while.

16:11.230 --> 16:13.232
Meantime, we'll get
this video to our experts,

16:13.270 --> 16:15.568
_ _see if we can't
identify our mystery man.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.704
(clicking mouse)

16:23.350 --> 16:25.705
Any luck cleaning up
that picture?

16:25.750 --> 16:28.469
About as much luck as I had
examining the hangar.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.317
No sign of any crime being
perpetrated there.

16:30.350 --> 16:32.011
No clarity with regards

16:32.050 --> 16:33.551
to our fat friend's
facial features here.

16:33.590 --> 16:36.411
On the bright side, I think
I might know where he works.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.452
WATSON:
"Arm To?"

16:42.400 --> 16:44.220
Carmanto Foods--
isn't that the company

16:44.270 --> 16:46.295
that Gerrard and his colleagues
were suing, right?

16:46.330 --> 16:48.389
Almost anyone who works there
would've had motive.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.738
Unfortunately, rotund
white male executives

16:50.770 --> 16:53.773
at the company number
in the dozens.

16:53.810 --> 16:56.131
Our suspect does have one
distinguishing feature, however:

16:56.180 --> 16:59.104
the '905-era "pager"
attached to his belt.

16:59.150 --> 17:01.675
I'm gonna go get started
getting ready to meet your dad.

17:01.720 --> 17:03.517
_ Last chance
to j0in us for dinner?

17:03.550 --> 17:05.484
Last chance to accept
there is no dinner.

17:05.520 --> 17:07.317
Dad... never... shows!

17:07.360 --> 17:08.452
Say it with me, Watson.

17:08.490 --> 17:10.287
Maybe it'll sink in.
Sherlock...

17:10.330 --> 17:11.581
He's Lucy with the football.

17:11.630 --> 17:13.291
You're Charlie Brown.

17:13.330 --> 17:15.525
People don't make plans
just to break them.

17:15.560 --> 17:17.391
People don't. My father does.

17:19.170 --> 17:21.536
For the record,
that's not a pager.

17:21.570 --> 17:24.403
It's an insulin pump.
Your mystery man is a diabetic.

17:28.680 --> 17:30.477
Ed Hairston?

17:30.510 --> 17:32.603
Detective Bell, NYPD.

17:32.650 --> 17:34.777
This is my colleague
Mr. Holmes.

17:34.820 --> 17:36.640
We'd like to ask you
some questions

17:36.680 --> 17:38.409
about your relationship
with Hank Gerrard.

17:38.450 --> 17:41.248
I'm sorry... I don't know
who that is.

17:41.290 --> 17:44.384
Odd. His firm is
sumg your company
for $100 million.

17:44.430 --> 17:46.819
Something about a sugar
substitute that causes cancer.

17:46.860 --> 17:48.259
We have surveillance
Video of you

17:48.300 --> 17:51.189
talking to Mr. Gerrard
in the Key Star Charters

17:51.230 --> 17:53.391
parking lot shortly before
someone caved his skull in,

17:53.440 --> 17:55.396
stuck him in the hold
of a small plane.

17:55.440 --> 17:56.566
It's how we found
you, actually.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.409
Saw the Carmanto logo
on your shirt,

17:58.440 --> 18:00.374
insulin pump on your
belt, made a few calls.

18:00.410 --> 18:02.230
It's a bit ironic,
isn't it?

18:02.280 --> 18:04.771
Diabetic working for a company
that makes bad sugar?

18:04.810 --> 18:06.368
I don't understand.

18:06.410 --> 18:08.310
I heard on the news
Hank was killed in a crash.

18:08.350 --> 18:10.489
This would be the same Hank
you don't know?

18:15.920 --> 18:17.456
I did know him, sort of.

18:17.490 --> 18:19.720
I was helping him.

18:19.760 --> 18:22.354
By showing his scalp
what the inside of
his skull looked like?

18:22.400 --> 18:24.459
It happened with his case.

18:24.500 --> 18:26.764
I'd been giving him
information

18:26.800 --> 18:28.438
to use against Carmanto.

18:28.470 --> 18:30.358
You're a whistleblower?

18:30.410 --> 18:33.402
Hank was angry with me
because I refused to testify.

18:33.440 --> 18:36.375
Carmanto had offered
a settlement.

18:36.410 --> 18:38.344
I thought it was more
than fair.

18:38.380 --> 18:39.802
Hank's boss was inclined

18:39.850 --> 18:43.479
to accept it,
and Hank wanted more.

18:43.520 --> 18:44.612
(top pops off pill bottle)
He...

18:44.650 --> 18:47.210
He asked me yesterday
to reconsider taking the stand.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.386
I told him I couldn't.

18:48.420 --> 18:50.320
We argued.
I left.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.681
I never laid a hand on him.

18:52.730 --> 18:56.791
The company knew that
that sugar substitute
was deadly.

18:56.830 --> 18:59.367
And Carmanto buried
that evidence,

18:59.400 --> 19:01.368
convinced everybody
it was fine.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.539
It looked like sugar,
it felt like sugar...

19:03.570 --> 19:05.435
but it wasn't.

19:05.470 --> 19:07.574
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Hairston; we'll be in touch.

19:07.610 --> 19:09.669
Thought you said
that guy was our
strongest suspect.

19:09.710 --> 19:11.439
Now that I've met him,

19:13.320 --> 19:14.548
Did you see how hard
it was for him

19:14.580 --> 19:17.378
to open that pill bottle?
So?

19:17.420 --> 19:18.717
Type-2 diabetes can
significantly affect

19:18.750 --> 19:20.718
grip strength,
particularly in men.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.580
His is so bad

19:22.620 --> 19:24.520
he's bought adaptive office
supplies:

19:24.560 --> 19:26.482
oversized ergonomic pens,
a book holder.

19:26.530 --> 19:28.452
There's no way could he have
grasped and swung

19:28.500 --> 19:30.297
the heaw wrench used
to kill Hank Gerrard.

19:30.330 --> 19:32.298
So, in other words,
we got nothing.

19:32.330 --> 19:34.298
Nope. We've got sand.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.489
Thank you.

19:35.540 --> 19:37.599
Mr. Holmes?

19:38.610 --> 19:39.759
Ms. Watson, I presume.

19:39.810 --> 19:41.437
You're early.

19:41.480 --> 19:44.301
Not as early as you.
It's nice to finally meet you.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.647
Oh!
Oh...

19:45.680 --> 19:47.614
Uh, Zadie Smith is one
of my favorite authors.

19:47.650 --> 19:51.279
Let me guess:
my son is parking the car.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.514
Um...

19:52.550 --> 19:53.710
No, it's okay,
Ms. Watson.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.489
No need for excuses.
The truth is

19:55.520 --> 20:00.628
I'd have been much more
surprised if he had come.

20:00.660 --> 20:04.289
I've laid as many bricks in
the wall between us as he has.

20:04.330 --> 20:07.538
So, how's the old boy doing?

20:07.570 --> 20:09.299
Good, actually.

20:09.340 --> 20:11.604
I think he's got a handle
on his post-rehab life.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.972
I mean, he doesn't keep
the healthiest hours,

20:14.010 --> 20:16.808
but you know, work keeps
him busy, focused.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.842
Getting him to go to
support group meetings

20:18.880 --> 20:20.575
can be triclq, though.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.349
Stubborn, criminally so.

20:22.380 --> 20:23.381
Always was.

20:23.420 --> 20:24.512
(polite laugh)

20:24.550 --> 20:25.915
I remember when he was a boy,

20:25.950 --> 20:27.508
he'd climb the fence

20:27.560 --> 20:29.778
around our property
and walk from post to post.

20:29.820 --> 20:34.450
I warned him it was dangerous,
but he wouldn't listen.

20:34.500 --> 20:37.492
Then he falls and
lands on his wrist.

20:37.530 --> 20:39.521
Ugly business,
bone jutting through skin.

20:39.570 --> 20:42.494
But despite the pain,

20:42.540 --> 20:45.338
he set the bone
and wrapped the wound himself.

20:45.370 --> 20:51.047
Took to wearing long-sleeve
shirts for the next few days.

20:51.080 --> 20:54.049
All to keep his father from
telling him that he was right.

20:54.080 --> 20:55.377
You're kidding me.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.684
Ended up with a scar right here.

20:57.720 --> 21:01.554
Covered it with one of his barmy
tattoos, if memory serves.

21:01.590 --> 21:04.286
I am really glad
we're doing this.

21:04.330 --> 21:06.480
Oh?
I've had many different
clients,

21:06.530 --> 21:09.920
but Sherlock is
definitely... unique.

21:09.960 --> 21:13.498
There's so just so much more
I want know about him.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.963
I'm happy to answer any
questions you may have.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.764
Would you mind terribly
if I asked one of you first?

21:18.810 --> 21:20.971
How's the sex?

21:21.010 --> 21:23.399
I beg your pardon?

21:23.450 --> 21:25.441
The sex. The shagging.

21:25.480 --> 21:27.619
Is he enjoying it?

21:27.650 --> 21:29.743
I don't understand.

21:29.780 --> 21:33.455
I was told that was part of
the "service" you provided.

21:33.490 --> 21:36.357
Satisfying your client's
every need.

21:36.390 --> 21:38.620
Why else would anyone pay
your exorbitant fees?

21:38.660 --> 21:41.390
You're not Mr. Holmes, are you?

21:45.670 --> 21:47.399
(laughs)

21:48.700 --> 21:50.668
I don't believe this.

21:50.710 --> 21:53.508
I'm sorry, it's just...

21:53.540 --> 21:55.906
if you'd seen your face...
(laughs)

21:55.940 --> 21:57.498
Who are you?

21:57.550 --> 21:58.539
Actor.

21:58.580 --> 22:00.775
Well, a struggling one at that.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.549
Your Mr. Sherlock

22:02.580 --> 22:03.740
hired me from
my manager.

22:03.790 --> 22:05.678
Said it wouldn't be
a problem if I took

22:05.720 --> 22:07.039
his father's place
tonight because...

22:07.090 --> 22:08.955
...Dad never shows.
(laughing):
Dad never shows.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.689
I was discussing
an artificial sweetener

22:12.730 --> 22:14.652
with a suspect earlier on.

22:14.700 --> 22:17.692
Yeah, looks and feels
like regular sugar,

22:17.730 --> 22:18.697
but it's not.

22:18.730 --> 22:20.891
There are minute differences,

22:20.940 --> 22:22.635
carcinogenic ones in that case,

22:22.670 --> 22:24.661
but it got me thinking
about some unusual sand

22:24.710 --> 22:27.406
I noticed at the crash site.

22:27.440 --> 22:29.738
It was new, hadn't been
weathered by the elements yet.

22:29.780 --> 22:32.101
First I thought, "Well, the city
must have trucked it in

22:32.150 --> 22:33.674
to offset erosion on the beach,"

22:33.720 --> 22:35.415
but according
to the Parks Department,

22:35.450 --> 22:36.678
they haven't done that
at Far Rockaway

22:36.720 --> 22:38.745
in over a year,
so how did the sand

22:38.790 --> 22:39.848
make it there?

22:39.890 --> 22:41.755
In the fuel tank.

22:41.790 --> 22:44.679
Sand dumped into the fuel tank

22:44.730 --> 22:46.755
would initially settle
on the bottom.

22:46.790 --> 22:49.918
Plane would take off,
no difficulty.

22:49.960 --> 22:53.930
But... during the course
of the flight,

22:53.970 --> 22:56.768
more and more granules
will get sucked into the filter,

22:56.800 --> 22:58.939
clogging it
and starving the engine

22:58.970 --> 23:00.870
of fuel mid-flight,
regardless of the extra weight

23:00.910 --> 23:02.400
of Hank Gerrard's body.

23:02.440 --> 23:04.670
You think the flight
was bound to crash.

23:04.710 --> 23:06.678
Actually, Ms. Molinari,

23:06.710 --> 23:09.873
as of this moment,
I know it was bound to crash.

23:14.990 --> 23:16.651
Same unfrosted grains

23:16.690 --> 23:18.885
I saw at the crash site,
looks and feels

23:18.930 --> 23:20.693
like beach sand, but it's not.

23:20.730 --> 23:22.755
These grains are comprised
mostly of silica,

23:22.800 --> 23:24.119
commercial sand.

23:24.170 --> 23:25.728
Somebody sabotaged the flight.

23:25.770 --> 23:28.136
Probably the same person
who killed Hank Gerrard.

23:28.170 --> 23:29.990
What if Hank walked in
on the saboteur?

23:30.040 --> 23:31.735
Easier to bash his skull in

23:31.770 --> 23:33.533
then explain why
you're funneling sand

23:33.580 --> 23:34.831
into a fuel tank, no?

23:34.880 --> 23:36.006
Then it's just a case

23:36.040 --> 23:37.132
of concealing the body.

23:37.180 --> 23:38.670
The cargo hold makes sense

23:38.710 --> 23:41.042
in that the flight was doomed
to crash anyway.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.718
As long as it crashed
over water.

23:42.750 --> 23:44.911
Which it would do
on its way to Martha's Vineyard.

23:44.950 --> 23:47.089
Traces of sand would
be washed away.

23:47.120 --> 23:50.749
Instead, it crashed prematurely
due to the weight imbalance.

23:50.790 --> 23:52.758
So, we know why
Hank Gerrard's body

23:52.790 --> 23:54.223
was stuffed into the cargo hold.

23:54.260 --> 23:56.091
The questions are:
who put it there,

23:56.130 --> 23:59.190
and why did they want
to bring down that plane?

24:05.670 --> 24:07.479
(door opens)

24:09.710 --> 24:12.543
You're home early.

24:12.580 --> 24:15.549
Did you enjoy your time
with dear old Dad?

24:17.850 --> 24:19.545
Oh, come on, Watson,

24:19.590 --> 24:21.683
show a little appreciation
for a prank well played.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.153
To pull that off,
I had to be

24:23.190 --> 24:25.727
absolutely certain
my father wouldn't show.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.694
I did mention that
he wouldn't show, didn't I?

24:27.730 --> 24:29.994
Just out of curiosity,

24:30.030 --> 24:32.021
why did the old tosspot
drop out this time?

24:32.070 --> 24:35.733
Surely he's e-mailed you
some sort of apology by now.

24:35.770 --> 24:36.862
He was called away

24:36.900 --> 24:38.538
On important business, yeah.

24:38.570 --> 24:41.209
An old one, but a good one.

24:42.940 --> 24:44.703
Aanay, It's good
that you're back.

24:44.750 --> 24:47.514
I realized earlier this evening
that the flight that crashed

24:47.550 --> 24:49.177
was sabotaged.

24:49.220 --> 24:51.188
The good news is I've been going
over Key Star Charter's

24:51.220 --> 24:53.017
flight logs,
and I believe I've found

24:53.050 --> 24:55.610
a mathematical quirk that has
pointed me in the direction

24:55.660 --> 24:56.752
of a suspect.

24:56.790 --> 24:58.018
I would like to go
and confront him.

24:58.060 --> 24:59.948
So...

25:01.630 --> 25:02.892
I waited for you.

25:02.930 --> 25:04.761
Hm? You should be grateful.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.791
If you want to go pound
on some criminal's door,

25:06.830 --> 25:08.138
I suggest you call the police.

25:08.170 --> 25:09.159
I'm going to bed.

25:09.200 --> 25:12.738
You should've trusted me

25:12.770 --> 25:14.169
when I told you
he wouldn't show.

25:14.210 --> 25:16.269
Trusted you?

25:16.310 --> 25:18.642
I've been glued to your
side for weeks now,

25:18.680 --> 25:20.147
and you have refused to share

25:20.180 --> 25:22.319
even the tiniest_bit
of your personal history.

25:22.350 --> 25:25.012
You know what, Sherlock,
I don't trust you.

25:25.050 --> 25:26.278
Because thanks to you,

25:26.320 --> 25:28.709
we're still basically
just strangers.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.625
(doorbell rings)

25:33.190 --> 25:36.318
Ah, Mr. Holmes, right?

25:36.360 --> 25:37.918
Mr. Barts, good
to see you again.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.722
You didn't mention
when we met

25:39.770 --> 25:41.328
that you're one of
Key Star's pilots.

25:41.370 --> 25:43.565
Well, yeah, I am.

25:43.610 --> 25:45.009
Is that a problem?

25:45.040 --> 25:46.564
Well, not for me, no.

25:46.610 --> 25:48.009
But for your recently
deceased colleague,

25:48.040 --> 25:49.905
Joe Newell, maybe.

25:49.940 --> 25:51.942
I don't understand.

25:51.980 --> 25:54.210
Joe Newell's widow told me

25:54.250 --> 25:55.877
that you and he
had a rather...

25:55.920 --> 25:57.342
ugly disagreement
on the telephone

25:57.380 --> 25:58.916
last week.

25:58.950 --> 26:00.349
He wouldn't tell her
what it was about.

26:00.390 --> 26:02.585
He just said that the problem
was being taken care of.

26:02.620 --> 26:03.826
That was nothing.

26:03.860 --> 26:05.327
Yeah, I poached
one of his regulars.

26:05.360 --> 26:07.692
This rich guy
who flies to DC. every week.

26:07.730 --> 26:08.924
Good tipper. (chuckles)

26:08.960 --> 26:11.622
Joe was angry,
but we worked it out.

26:11.670 --> 26:13.126
We were thinking the argument
may have been

26:13.170 --> 26:14.899
over something else.

26:14.940 --> 26:16.089
You see,

26:16.140 --> 26:17.607
when I realized that Joe's plane

26:17.640 --> 26:18.902
had been sabotaged,

26:18.940 --> 26:21.238
it occurred to me
that the saboteur

26:21.280 --> 26:22.770
may have been
satisfying a grudge,

26:22.810 --> 26:24.607
not against one of the
flight's passengers,

26:24.650 --> 26:26.743
but against the airline itself.

26:26.780 --> 26:29.772
Now I dug into some of the
logs that the NTSB gathered

26:29.820 --> 26:31.742
from Key Star, and I noticed

26:31.790 --> 26:33.189
something strange.

26:33.220 --> 26:35.654
Every time you, Owen Barts,

26:35.690 --> 26:37.783
piloted a plane
back from Miami,

26:37.830 --> 26:40.822
you recorded an onboard
weight of exactly 66 pounds

26:40.860 --> 26:44.694
over the weight of the
passengers and their baggage.

26:44.730 --> 26:47.392
It's just a mistake
with my math.

26:47.430 --> 26:50.331
The same mathematical mistake,
made again and again,

26:50.370 --> 26:52.804
only when you return
from Miami, Florida.

26:52.840 --> 26:54.102
No.

26:54.140 --> 26:55.778
You were accounting
for extra cargo.

26:55.810 --> 26:59.302
You had to, because
accurate weight calculations

26:59.350 --> 27:01.818
are critical when determining
the amount of fuel

27:01.850 --> 27:03.841
required for a flight.

27:03.890 --> 27:06.040
But why 66 pounds exactly?

27:06.090 --> 27:07.682
A strange number.

27:07.720 --> 27:10.086
Until you factor in
metric conversion.

27:10.120 --> 27:14.250
66 pounds is the equivalent
of exactly 30 kilos.

27:15.760 --> 27:16.954
Nice even number

27:17.000 --> 27:18.399
for cocaine smuggling, no?

27:18.430 --> 27:20.193
(chuckles)
What happened?

27:20.230 --> 27:21.868
Did Joe find out
and want a cut?

27:21.900 --> 27:24.039
That's not likely,

27:24.070 --> 27:25.435
given his reputation,
his military background.

27:25.470 --> 27:27.404
It's more likely
that he threatened to go

27:27.440 --> 27:28.873
to the authorities
if you didn't stop.

27:28.910 --> 27:30.434
Either way,

27:30.480 --> 27:33.677
you engineered a plane crash
to eliminate the threat.

27:33.720 --> 27:37.781
Problem was, Hank Gerrard
caught you in the act.

27:37.820 --> 27:39.447
You improvised.

27:39.490 --> 27:41.788
You killed him.

27:41.820 --> 27:43.959
Concealed his body
in the cargo hold of a plane

27:43.990 --> 27:45.924
that you knew was gonna crash.

27:45.960 --> 27:49.452
It's quite a... quite a story.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.821
There's just one problem.

27:51.870 --> 27:54.236
I was nowhere near the hangar
this morning.

27:54.270 --> 27:56.238
I was with my boss, Charles.

27:56.270 --> 27:57.908
His car stalled,

27:57.940 --> 28:00.807
so I had to stop by his place
to give him a jump.

28:00.840 --> 28:02.728
Don't believe me, go ask him.

28:02.780 --> 28:04.247
He'll tell you.

28:04.280 --> 28:05.702
I couldn't have killed
Mr. Gerrard

28:05.750 --> 28:08.218
or sabotaged that plane.

28:13.920 --> 28:16.354
Holy...

28:16.390 --> 28:17.789
You were right.

28:17.830 --> 28:19.889
Yesterday, when
you suggested

28:19.930 --> 28:22.091
I had a certain preoccupation
with plane crashes.

28:22.130 --> 28:25.827
It is why I was drawn
to this case.

28:28.100 --> 28:29.863
I'm not phobic, mind you.

28:29.900 --> 28:31.231
Nothing so illogical.

28:31.270 --> 28:33.431
I just...
the amount I see

28:33.470 --> 28:35.904
when I board an aircraft...

28:35.940 --> 28:38.408
The pilot looks confident,

28:38.450 --> 28:40.475
but I detect a slight tremor
in his hands.

28:40.510 --> 28:42.046
He's nervous.
Is he hiding something?

28:42.080 --> 28:43.513
If yes, what?

28:43.550 --> 28:45.780
Has he had a few drinks
to settle his nerves?

28:45.820 --> 28:47.344
What about the mechanic
performing a last-second check?

28:47.390 --> 28:49.813
Why does he look so unhappy?
Does he hate his job?

28:49.860 --> 28:51.919
If he hates his job,
how much care is he taking?

28:51.960 --> 28:53.427
I get it.

28:55.500 --> 28:56.899
You're still cross with me?

28:58.830 --> 29:01.765
I was attempting to demonstrate
my trust in you.

29:01.800 --> 29:03.461
How?

29:03.500 --> 29:05.968
By telling me something
I already figured out?

29:06.010 --> 29:08.001
You want more?

29:08.040 --> 29:10.474
(phone rings)

29:11.810 --> 29:13.448
Detective Bell?

29:13.480 --> 29:16.347
BELL: I just heard back
from Charles Cooper.

29:16.380 --> 29:17.847
He's on his way to the station.

29:17.890 --> 29:19.482
Thought you might want
to join us.

29:19.520 --> 29:21.852
Owen called me last night,

29:21.890 --> 29:23.448
uh, in a panic.

29:23.490 --> 29:25.151
He said he needed my help.

29:25.190 --> 29:26.885
(whispering) :
It's glue again.

29:26.930 --> 29:28.056
It's worse this time.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.897
It's like he bathed
in the stuff.

29:29.930 --> 29:31.363
He told me he'd made
a big mistake.

29:31.400 --> 29:34.528
That he'd used
the Key Star planes

29:34.570 --> 29:36.868
to smuggle drugs.

29:36.900 --> 29:37.798
Mr. Cooper, are you okay?

29:37.840 --> 29:39.501
You look a little pale.

29:39.540 --> 29:41.838
No, I guess I'm just I shock.

29:41.880 --> 29:43.871
I mean...

29:43.910 --> 29:45.878
O-Owen had worked for me
for years.

29:45.910 --> 29:47.502
He was a friend,

29:47.550 --> 29:49.017
just like Joe was.

29:49.050 --> 29:50.540
But he said that, uh,

29:50.580 --> 29:53.014
Joe had figured it out

29:53.050 --> 29:54.551
and threatened to call
the police

29:54.590 --> 29:56.558
if he didn't stop.

29:56.590 --> 29:59.559
But Owen didn't want to stop,
and so...

29:59.590 --> 30:01.353
he, uh...

30:01.400 --> 30:02.856
Mr. Cooper, did Owen tell you

30:02.900 --> 30:06.324
he had something to do
with the plane crash?

30:06.370 --> 30:08.998
He wanted me to tell you guys
that he was with me

30:09.040 --> 30:11.099
at the time
of Mr. Gerrard's murder.

30:11.140 --> 30:13.938
But he wasn't.

30:13.980 --> 30:15.936
GREGSON:
Could you excuse
us for a second?

30:22.620 --> 30:25.180
Get a team over _to Owen Barts'
re5idence right now.

30:25.220 --> 30:26.949
I'm gonna call for a warrant.

30:26.990 --> 30:29.049
Ink will be dry before your foot
goes through his door.

30:29.090 --> 30:30.284
Yes, sir.

30:30.320 --> 30:32.026
No Barts?

30:32.060 --> 30:33.584
Lot of drawers tossed inside.

30:33.630 --> 30:35.518
Looks like he packed
a bag in a hurry.

30:35.560 --> 30:37.551
Now, his car is gone
too-- blue Toyota Camry.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.192
We got a BOLO out.

30:39.230 --> 30:41.039
What's weird
iswhat is here.

30:41.070 --> 30:42.469
Going by the dimensions,
I'd say it's

30:42.500 --> 30:44.604
a safe bet this is the
weapon used to kill him.

30:44.640 --> 30:47.268
So let me get this straight:
Owen Barts kills

30:47.310 --> 30:49.574
Hank Gerrard with this wrench,
but he doesn't dispose of it

30:49.610 --> 30:51.942
in some place
we aren't gonna find it.

30:51.980 --> 30:53.971
He doesn't even clean it.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.874
He just leaves it
in his garage?

30:55.920 --> 30:57.945
Like I said, weird.

30:57.990 --> 31:00.049
Not just weird.

31:00.090 --> 31:02.251
Utterly ridiculous.

31:02.290 --> 31:03.848
What's that?

31:05.560 --> 31:07.221
Spartina patens.

31:07.260 --> 31:08.522
It's a type of cord grass

31:08.560 --> 31:10.619
which grows only
in brackish water.

31:10.660 --> 31:12.059
Brackish?

31:12.100 --> 31:13.897
It's a combination of fresh
and salt water.

31:13.940 --> 31:15.191
Hmm.

31:15.240 --> 31:16.889
It's still a bit moist,

31:16.940 --> 31:19.238
which means the wrench was
in the water...

31:19.270 --> 31:22.376
recently.

31:28.620 --> 31:30.986
I think someone
did dispose of it

31:31.020 --> 31:33.545
and retrieved it...

31:36.390 --> 31:38.585
...and planted it here.

31:38.630 --> 31:41.690
Probably right
after they killed Owen Barts.

31:41.730 --> 31:43.197
I get why

31:43.230 --> 31:44.697
you think the wrench
was planted,

31:44.730 --> 31:47.369
but what makes you think
Barts is dead?

31:47.400 --> 31:48.697
His car.

31:48.740 --> 31:50.367
You said it as a Camry?

31:50.400 --> 31:51.936
Solid, practical choice.

31:51.970 --> 31:53.528
But look at this--

31:53.570 --> 31:55.003
full-synthetic motor oil.

31:55.040 --> 31:56.928
It's high-end.

31:56.980 --> 32:01.178
Used to maintain peak lubricity
in high-performance engines.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.573
Not the four-cylinder
engine of a Camry.

32:02.620 --> 32:05.111
Hmm.

32:09.520 --> 32:11.124
Imagine you're Owen Barts.

32:11.160 --> 32:13.082
You've just been
told by your boss,

32:13.130 --> 32:15.598
Charles Cooper, that
he won't alibi you

32:15.630 --> 32:17.723
for the murder
of Hank Gerrard.

32:17.760 --> 32:20.695
You decide to go on the lam.

32:20.730 --> 32:23.096
You rush home...

32:23.140 --> 32:25.335
you pack up your things,

32:25.370 --> 32:27.531
and then you decide to
leave what seems to be

32:27.570 --> 32:30.630
between 50 and 100,000

32:30.680 --> 32:33.001
of your hard-earned
smuggling dollars

32:33.050 --> 32:34.972
in your garage.

32:35.020 --> 32:37.147
Not a chance.

32:37.180 --> 32:38.989
So who else
may have been profiting

32:39.020 --> 32:41.284
from the smuggling operation
at Key Star Charters, hmm?

32:41.320 --> 32:43.550
Who else who would've seen
Joe Newell as a threat

32:43.590 --> 32:46.479
and had the technical know-how
to sabotage his plane?

32:46.530 --> 32:47.724
The same guy who told us

32:47.760 --> 32:50.149
Owen Barts confessed
to everything.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.668
Charles Cooper.

32:56.570 --> 32:58.629
I don't know how many
times I can tell you,

32:58.670 --> 33:00.001
Owen called me last night.

33:00.040 --> 33:01.234
He told me that he sabotaged

33:01.280 --> 33:02.429
Joe's plane.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.175
I'm sorry if you cat find him.

33:04.210 --> 33:06.576
Have you ever seen
a poorer excuse for a liar?

33:06.610 --> 33:09.078
Are you sure he did
everything you said he did?

33:09.120 --> 33:10.610
Note the pallor,
the perspiration,

33:10.650 --> 33:13.244
the inability to
hold eye contact.

33:13.290 --> 33:14.609
_ All telltale _
Signs of deceit.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.787
And_ some serious
medical conditions.

33:16.820 --> 33:20.654
I'm just saying,
the guy looks like he's dying.

33:20.690 --> 33:23.454
He's our murderer
and our saboteur.

33:23.500 --> 33:25.525
Now it's just a matter
of getting him

33:25.570 --> 33:27.663
to admit it.

33:34.180 --> 33:36.136
Something wrong?

33:36.180 --> 33:39.172
No, I just never noticed
that scar before, that's all.

33:39.210 --> 33:40.472
How'd you get it?

33:40.510 --> 33:43.343
Boyhood misadventure.

33:43.380 --> 33:45.712
Fell off a fence.

33:45.750 --> 33:48.753
A compound fracture,
hence the scar.

33:52.560 --> 33:55.688
I just remembered
an errand I forgot to run.

33:55.730 --> 33:59.723
You gonna be okay
on your own for a while?

33:59.770 --> 34:01.761
Somehow I'll soldier on.

34:13.680 --> 34:14.647
Problem?

34:14.680 --> 34:16.216
He won't cop to it.

34:16.250 --> 34:17.672
But he's on the precipice,
you can tell.

34:17.720 --> 34:19.119
He's sweating,
his hands are trembling.

34:19.150 --> 34:20.481
We've come at him

34:20.520 --> 34:22.158
with everything we got;
he won't budge.

34:22.190 --> 34:23.657
Because he knows
we got no proof.

34:23.690 --> 34:25.749
His frame-up of Owen Barts
may not have been perfect,

34:25.790 --> 34:28.429
but he knows we can't show
he had anything to do with it.

34:28.460 --> 34:29.859
(sniffing)
What?

34:29.900 --> 34:32.164
It's got, it's got into you now.
Model glue.

34:32.200 --> 34:33.497
(sniffing)

34:33.530 --> 34:35.589
That's probably why
he looks so ill.

34:35.640 --> 34:38.438
Fumes are finally
getting to him.

34:48.550 --> 34:49.847
That's Cooper's glass,
correct?

34:49.880 --> 34:51.780
His third one,
if you can believe it.

34:51.820 --> 34:53.139
Cut him off.

34:53.190 --> 34:54.589
No, no, no.

34:54.620 --> 34:56.781
I think you should
bring him a pitcher.

34:58.690 --> 35:01.727
I was wondering
if you could help me...

35:01.760 --> 35:03.227
Alistair.

35:03.260 --> 35:05.262
Miss Watson.

35:05.300 --> 35:06.892
What a surprise.

35:06.930 --> 35:09.535
But if you're here for
an encore performance...

35:09.570 --> 35:11.731
I know you're not just
some actor Sherlock hired.

35:11.770 --> 35:13.169
You know him.

35:13.210 --> 35:15.906
He engaged me through
my representation.

35:15.940 --> 35:17.339
I've never even seen
the man...

35:17.380 --> 35:18.745
That story you told me,

35:18.780 --> 35:21.214
the one about his broken wrist;
it was true.

35:21.250 --> 35:22.877
He would've never
shared that with you

35:22.920 --> 35:24.842
if you were just some actor.

35:24.890 --> 35:26.539
Especially not to play
some stupid prank.

35:26.590 --> 35:28.751
How did you find me, if
you don't mind me asking?

35:28.790 --> 35:30.451
WATSON:
The receipt you dropped.

35:30.490 --> 35:32.185
It had the name
of this bookstore on it.

35:32.230 --> 35:34.448
You got a 20% discount;
members get ten.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.229
I realized
you must work here.

35:36.260 --> 35:38.364
You've been spending
quite a bit of time

35:38.400 --> 35:39.697
with him, haven't you?

35:39.730 --> 35:42.597
I really am an actor,
you know.

35:42.640 --> 35:45.234
In London, I had a small
part in a radio drama.

35:45.270 --> 35:46.703
(chuckles)

35:46.740 --> 35:48.901
Yeah, we still have
those across the pond.

35:48.940 --> 35:52.239
Sherlock wrote me a letter when
he was ten, saying that I alone

35:52.280 --> 35:54.840
of all the cast truly captured
the Yorkshire accent.

35:54.880 --> 35:56.871
(both chuckle)

35:56.920 --> 35:58.808
Yeah, I thought
it was odd.

35:58.850 --> 36:00.579
But I was also
very flattered.

36:00.620 --> 36:02.588
So eventually, we met,

36:02.620 --> 36:04.281
_so I could coach
him on its nuances.

36:04.330 --> 36:05.354
We became friends.

36:05.390 --> 36:07.779
Sherlock doesn't have friends.

36:07.830 --> 36:09.650
Not in the traditional sense.

36:09.700 --> 36:11.793
He drops in and out,
appears at odd moments

36:11.830 --> 36:14.890
to make outrageous and
highly specific requests.

36:14.940 --> 36:18.706
Respectfully, that doesn't sound
much like a friendship to me.

36:18.740 --> 36:21.379
Then perhaps you better
revise your definition.

36:21.410 --> 36:22.968
You can't expect Sherlock Holmes

36:23.010 --> 36:24.944
to relate to you
the way others might.

36:24.980 --> 36:27.301
The moment you do,
he'll migrate

36:27.350 --> 36:29.773
out of your life,
and you'll be the poorer for it.

36:31.950 --> 36:34.282
You do realize that, don't you?

36:36.360 --> 36:37.759
He told you about me, right?

36:37.790 --> 36:38.757
Yeah.

36:38.790 --> 36:39.984
You know what my job is?

36:40.030 --> 36:40.985
I do.

36:41.030 --> 36:44.227
And for what
it's worth, um...

36:44.270 --> 36:47.296
I'm very glad
he has you.

36:48.900 --> 36:50.731
You knew him when he was using?

36:50.770 --> 36:54.001
(sighs)

36:54.040 --> 36:57.430
Well, after I first
came here in '06,

36:57.480 --> 37:00.904
we mostly kept in touch
by e-mail.

37:03.450 --> 37:06.647
but I was confident
that he would grow out of it.

37:06.690 --> 37:09.989
Nine months ago, he shows up
at my flat at night,

37:10.020 --> 37:12.523
so high he could barely speak.

37:12.560 --> 37:13.822
Well, I flushed
his drugs

37:13.860 --> 37:15.794
and I looked after
him for a clay or so.

37:15.830 --> 37:18.924
It was very...

37:18.970 --> 37:22.963
difficult for me
to see his mind so addled.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.959
He could barely
stay conscious.

37:27.010 --> 37:29.376
And when he kept muttering the
same name again and again...

37:29.410 --> 37:30.434
What name?

37:30.480 --> 37:31.799
It doesn't matter.

37:31.850 --> 37:34.648
I asked him about it
the next morning.

37:34.680 --> 37:36.773
He assured me it meant nothing.

37:36.820 --> 37:39.015
Did you believe him?

37:42.820 --> 37:46.779
Look... I want to help him,

37:46.830 --> 37:49.651
but I think you know
how difficult that can be.

37:49.700 --> 37:51.565
I thought,
if I could talk to you,

37:51.600 --> 37:55.730
that maybe you could help me
get a better sense of...

37:55.770 --> 37:57.658
of what to do.

38:01.010 --> 38:01.999
Aanay. . .

38:02.040 --> 38:05.942
thank you...

38:05.980 --> 38:08.540
for your time.

38:08.580 --> 38:10.912
I'm sorry if I bothered you.

38:10.950 --> 38:12.941
Miss Watson?

38:15.460 --> 38:17.382
I have a strong
suspicion that that name

38:17.420 --> 38:19.627
meant more to him
than he claimed.

38:22.830 --> 38:25.993
I think perhaps
you should have it.

38:32.840 --> 38:34.068
Mr. Cooper.

38:34.110 --> 38:35.805
Nice to see you again.

38:35.840 --> 38:37.330
Do you need to urinate?

38:37.380 --> 38:38.904
What?

38:38.950 --> 38:40.975
Do you need to urinate?

38:41.010 --> 38:43.513
No, I'm good, thanks.

38:43.550 --> 38:47.088
Last night, when you struggled
with your co-conspirator, Owen,

38:47.120 --> 38:48.951
he nicked you with something.

38:48.990 --> 38:50.116
A kitchen knife, perhaps?

38:50.160 --> 38:51.787
Excuse me?
ObVIously, you...

38:51.830 --> 38:54.526
you got the better of him,
but given your pallor,

38:54.560 --> 38:57.597
I'd say that the wound
was significant.

38:57.630 --> 39:00.098
I believed you earlier on when
you said that you were in shock.

39:00.130 --> 39:01.768
But now I think
it's something else:

39:01.800 --> 39:03.028
blood loss.

39:03.070 --> 39:04.935
Pint or two, if I had to guess.

39:04.970 --> 39:06.733
That's why you're so thirsty.

39:06.770 --> 39:08.909
Your body needs to replace
the fluids that it's lost.

39:08.940 --> 39:10.430
If it didn't,
then you'd have asked

39:10.480 --> 39:12.072
_to visit the loo
qUIte some time ago.

39:12.110 --> 39:14.749
I'm sorry,
but you think I'm a killer

39:16.550 --> 39:18.381
That and the model glue.

39:18.420 --> 39:19.842
You stink of it.

39:19.890 --> 39:21.118
Initially, I'd assumed
that you just

39:21.150 --> 39:22.515
spilled some on your clothing,

39:22.560 --> 39:24.425
but now that I know
about the wound...

39:24.460 --> 39:25.620
What wound?

39:25.660 --> 39:27.127
The one beneath
your clothing.

39:27.160 --> 39:28.798
The one that you sealed
with the adhesive

39:28.830 --> 39:30.092
you use to build
your model planes.

39:30.130 --> 39:31.688
It's an old
military trick.

39:31.730 --> 39:34.164
Field medics use it
to seal up a wound

39:34.200 --> 39:35.758
when there isn't
time for stitches.

39:35.800 --> 39:37.791
You used it to avoid
a trip to the hospital

39:37.840 --> 39:39.467
'cause you didn't want
the injury on record.

39:39.510 --> 39:42.138
You know, I think
I've given you guys

39:42.180 --> 39:43.704
enough of my time today.

39:43.740 --> 39:45.640
Okay, you want to leave?
That's not a problem.

39:45.680 --> 39:49.138
Just take off your shirt and
your pants, show us I'm wrong.

39:51.450 --> 39:53.088
I cut my side open

39:53.120 --> 39:56.112
on a sharp piece of metal
in my hangar last night.

39:56.160 --> 39:58.116
I was going to get stitches,
Owen called.

39:58.160 --> 39:59.627
I was upset.

39:59.660 --> 40:02.823
And I'd used glue
on a cut before, so...

40:02.860 --> 40:05.761
Let's say he's right,
Mr. Cooper.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.495
(clears throat)

40:07.530 --> 40:11.432
How much blood do you think
ended up on Owen's body?

40:11.470 --> 40:13.563
Do you know how easy
it's gonna be for us

40:13.610 --> 40:16.033
to tie you to his murder,
once we find it?

40:16.080 --> 40:18.799
I didn't murder anyone.

40:18.850 --> 40:20.806
And there is no body.
Course there is.

40:20.850 --> 40:23.045
I even think
I know where to find it.

40:23.080 --> 40:24.786
Jamaica Bay or Alley Pond Park.

40:26.120 --> 40:27.678
It was the wrench.

40:27.720 --> 40:29.779
You threw it in a body
of brackish water

40:29.820 --> 40:31.583
after you murdered Hank Gerrard.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.985
The only ones in New York are
the ones I just mentioned.

40:34.030 --> 40:36.658
Last night, when Owen called you
and told you we were onto

40:36.700 --> 40:38.122
the smuggling
and the sabotage,

40:38.160 --> 40:39.593
you went and retrieved it.

40:39.630 --> 40:40.927
You killed him,

40:40.970 --> 40:43.029
and then you planted it
in his garage

40:43.070 --> 40:46.506
so we'd pin everything on him
and him alone.

40:46.540 --> 40:48.474
Was a lazy bit of framing,
if you ask me,

40:48.510 --> 40:50.034
but you are wounded.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.206
So...

40:51.240 --> 40:53.674
here's the thing, Mr. Cooper.

40:53.710 --> 40:56.144
I know that you killed
Owen Barts,

40:56.180 --> 40:58.944
just like I know that you killed
your "friend" Joe Newell

40:58.990 --> 41:01.550
and his passengers.

41:01.590 --> 41:04.718
I also know that you like to
hide things in brackish water.

41:04.760 --> 41:07.627
Now, a dead body is considerably
larger than a wrench,

41:07.660 --> 41:10.254
but you were in no condition
to dig a grave last night.

41:10.300 --> 41:12.598
Jamaica Bay and
Alley Pond Park

41:12.630 --> 41:14.769
are very large areas,
but the NYPD

41:14.800 --> 41:17.234
is planning on
searching them both.

41:17.270 --> 41:18.737
You could save them

41:18.770 --> 41:20.761
a great deal of
time and trouble,

41:20.810 --> 41:24.075
and tell them where Owen is,
or you could continue to lie.

41:24.110 --> 41:26.806
Thing is, if you lie,
you'll just give the DA.

41:26.850 --> 41:29.614
more time to consider
making this a federal case.

41:29.650 --> 41:31.242
Uncle Sam doesn't
take too kindly

41:31.280 --> 41:34.147
to people who bring down planes.

41:34.190 --> 41:36.750
The death penalty
is a real possibility.

41:39.160 --> 41:41.151
My advice?

41:41.190 --> 41:44.091
Tell us everything
you know.

41:44.130 --> 41:48.863
The great State of New York will
only give you life in prison.

41:57.980 --> 42:00.278
I take it you made your case
against Charles Cooper?

42:00.310 --> 42:02.574
Ah, the police made the case.

42:02.620 --> 42:04.542
I just lent a helping hand.

42:04.590 --> 42:09.152
An enormous helping hand,
but still.

42:09.190 --> 42:10.748
What is it?

42:10.790 --> 42:13.224
You look peculiar.

42:13.260 --> 42:16.696
I guess there's a question
I want to ask you.

42:16.730 --> 42:17.992
About your past.

42:18.030 --> 42:20.089
Excellent.

42:20.130 --> 42:22.860
You wait here, I'll go
to my room, shut the door.

42:22.900 --> 42:25.232
As soon as you're absolutely
certain I can't hear you,

42:25.270 --> 42:26.703
ask away.

42:26.740 --> 42:28.731
I know about Irene.

42:30.780 --> 42:32.907
I want you to tell me about her.
