WEBVTT

00:00.469 --> 00:04.504
Rel is taped in front
of a live studio audience.

00:04.505 --> 00:07.573
Man, you about to be
God's favorite pastor,

00:07.575 --> 00:09.976
'cause this custom robe is heavenly.

00:09.977 --> 00:11.978
That it is.

00:11.979 --> 00:13.846
I'm gonna tell you this.
Sister Brittany,

00:13.847 --> 00:15.848
you have outdone yourself.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.885
I'm officially the most lit pastor

00:18.886 --> 00:22.221
in the city of Chicago.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.535
I cannot wait for my
congregation to see this.

00:23.536 --> 00:24.567
Mm-hmm.

00:24.568 --> 00:25.725
I mean, hopefully, when they see this,

00:25.726 --> 00:27.260
they'll stop talking about, uh,

00:27.261 --> 00:29.228
Deacon Dwayne's dashiki.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.798
Uh, Pastor,

00:31.799 --> 00:33.566
sorry, I didn't get
a chance to ring you up.

00:33.567 --> 00:37.170
I thought I was getting
the pastor's discount.

00:37.171 --> 00:38.638
What's the pastor's discount?

00:38.639 --> 00:41.174
I take it, and I just keep walking.

00:41.175 --> 00:43.543
Okay, what you don't realize is

00:43.544 --> 00:46.346
I'm an advertisement
for your business.

00:46.347 --> 00:49.949
I'm a community influencer.
I influence everybody.

00:49.950 --> 00:52.418
All I'm saying is, Sister Brittany,

00:52.419 --> 00:53.886
I walk out of here with this,

00:53.887 --> 00:56.756
you'll have every pastor
in the state of Illinois

00:56.757 --> 00:58.424
calling you to make their robes.

00:58.425 --> 01:00.226
- Hmm.
- How 'bout this?

01:00.227 --> 01:01.694
For payment,

01:01.695 --> 01:03.596
I'll give you an absolution.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.197
What's an absolution?

01:05.199 --> 01:08.234
Well, it's where I bless you
and wash away all your sins.

01:10.437 --> 01:12.305
See, I'm already starting
the absolutions.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.240
See?

01:14.241 --> 01:15.575
Hey, Pastor.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.543
Oh, man, I'm-a tell you this.

01:17.544 --> 01:20.113
This sign spinning game is serious.

01:20.114 --> 01:23.116
I almost got jumped on
by three other sign spinners.

01:24.218 --> 01:25.351
How you doing in here?

01:25.352 --> 01:26.919
Good. I sold two dresses,

01:26.920 --> 01:30.223
and I got a Get Out of Hell Free
card from the pastor.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.228
What you doing here?

01:35.229 --> 01:36.396
Hi, Brittany, honey.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.131
I-I know it's been a long time.

01:38.132 --> 01:39.365
Ms. Monique?

01:39.366 --> 01:41.067
Hi, Rel. It's good to see you.

01:41.068 --> 01:43.102
- Uh, Brittany, I was just hoping...
- No.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.203
No.

01:46.073 --> 01:48.741
I guess that wasn't the happy
mother-daughter reunion

01:48.742 --> 01:50.543
I was hoping for.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.278
I mean, I don't know what to tell you.

01:52.279 --> 01:56.716
I mean, you...
been a pretty terrible mom.

01:56.717 --> 01:59.051
I mean, listen,
I've been back for a few months.

01:59.053 --> 02:01.053
I'm just trying
to get my life together.

02:01.055 --> 02:05.258
I'm not chasing any random ball
players or musicians anymore.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.393
I actually got a steady job.

02:07.394 --> 02:09.795
I'm not partying like I used to.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.632
Yeah, I mean...

02:12.633 --> 02:16.269
you don't smell like Hennessy.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.505
Rel, listen, I don't want
to put you in the middle

02:19.506 --> 02:22.175
of this, but I just need you to...

02:22.176 --> 02:23.643
please,

02:23.644 --> 02:25.478
- just have her call me, okay?
- You can't say

02:25.479 --> 02:26.779
you don't want to put me in the middle

02:26.780 --> 02:28.815
and then you give me your number
like that.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.883
Hey, hey. You know? So you better

02:30.884 --> 02:33.719
get out of here, because...
you ain't supposed to be here.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.488
Brittany don't want you in her store!

02:35.489 --> 02:36.956
Leave!

02:39.226 --> 02:41.361
I can't make no promises. Get
out of here. I'll try something.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.396
- Okay? Yes. Okay. Thank you.
- Okay. Please, Rel. Please.

02:43.397 --> 02:45.631
- Bye.
- Thank you.

02:47.267 --> 02:49.669
Hey, uh, I won't...
I won't spin the signs no more,

02:49.670 --> 02:51.671
so you ain't got to jump me.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:01.715 --> 03:03.049
I can't believe her,

03:03.050 --> 03:04.550
just popping up in my pop-up.

03:04.551 --> 03:07.553
Poppity-ass bitch.

03:07.554 --> 03:10.056
Yeah. That's why, when she tried
to give me that phone number,

03:10.057 --> 03:12.725
I was like, "Oh, no, lady,
it's too late. You blew it."

03:12.726 --> 03:14.627
Thanks, Rel. You always got my back.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.529
You damn right I do.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.964
But here's her number.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.100
I'm not calling her.

03:21.101 --> 03:23.636
What, you forgot how she
would always drop everything

03:23.637 --> 03:24.837
for a come-up?

03:24.838 --> 03:26.772
She wasn't a mom, yo.

03:26.774 --> 03:28.307
She was a professional groupie.

03:28.308 --> 03:29.976
Like that time in Minnesota

03:29.977 --> 03:33.379
when she ditched me to try
to trap Latrell Sprewell.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.615
I mean, look, that was
just a bad move altogether.

03:35.616 --> 03:38.985
You know, that was post-choke,
you know what I mean?

03:38.986 --> 03:42.154
She just made horrible
dating choices in general.

03:42.156 --> 03:43.923
Like, remember when we were freshmen,

03:43.924 --> 03:45.825
she hooked up with that senior Devon?

03:45.826 --> 03:47.927
Do you know how embarrassing
it is for your mom

03:47.928 --> 03:49.762
to drop you off to school and kiss you

03:49.763 --> 03:51.597
and your classmate good-bye?

03:51.598 --> 03:54.901
Okay, but-but, in your mom's defense,

03:54.902 --> 03:56.469
you know, Devon was a super senior.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.170
He was 23 years old.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.473
And, look, look, look,

04:00.474 --> 04:02.108
let's-let's think about
the good memories, right?

04:02.109 --> 04:04.043
You remember when your ma used
to let us stay up all night

04:04.044 --> 04:05.311
and watch any movie we wanted?

04:05.312 --> 04:07.480
You remember the time
she let us watch Candyman?

04:07.481 --> 04:08.741
We were in elementary school.

04:08.982 --> 04:11.317
We we supposed to be watching
stuff about mermaids,

04:11.318 --> 04:12.752
not serial killers.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.488
I mean, come on, it was fun, huh?

04:15.489 --> 04:16.555
You remember.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.190
Candyman.

04:18.192 --> 04:20.259
Candyman...

04:20.260 --> 04:23.796
You still won't say it a third time.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.298
Look, Rel,

04:25.299 --> 04:27.800
all that stuff
might have been fun for you,

04:27.801 --> 04:29.302
but that's 'cause you
didn't have to deal

04:29.303 --> 04:30.636
with being raised by her.

04:30.637 --> 04:32.438
I just wanted a mom like you had.

04:32.439 --> 04:35.107
Look, you did.
My mom loved you, all right?

04:35.108 --> 04:37.109
But Ms. Monique coming back, you know,

04:37.110 --> 04:39.946
and reaching out to you,
ma-maybe she's trying this time.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.881
I'm serious. The one thing

04:41.882 --> 04:43.783
I learned from my mom passing
is that...

04:43.784 --> 04:46.586
y-you never know
how long somebody is here.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.423
Look, Brit,

04:50.424 --> 04:53.559
give her a call.

04:53.560 --> 04:54.961
Damn you, Rel.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.963
You always make me do this.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.364
Do what?

04:58.365 --> 05:00.866
Feel.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.001
Candyman.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.370
Oh! Wait, you can't...

05:05.739 --> 05:08.474
Whew. You won't believe
what just happened.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.543
Tell me. I'll believe anything.

05:10.544 --> 05:11.677
All right.

05:11.678 --> 05:13.346
I'm walking down the street,
minding my own business.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.181
So, this guy is trying
to change his flat tire.

05:15.182 --> 05:16.482
He don't even know what he's doing.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.650
The jack is all jacked up.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.018
The lug nuts are stripped.

05:19.019 --> 05:20.653
And I'm trying not
to make eye contact,

05:20.654 --> 05:21.687
'cause I don't want to help.

05:21.688 --> 05:23.489
But then he catches my eye.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.658
I said, "Damn."
Being the good Christian I am,

05:25.659 --> 05:27.026
so I stopped and I helped him.

05:27.027 --> 05:29.028
That's unbelievable.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.530
No, that's not the unbelievable part.

05:30.531 --> 05:32.064
He was the Bulls' mascot,

05:32.065 --> 05:34.800
and he gave me two tickets
to the Bulls game.

05:34.801 --> 05:37.403
Fourth row, right behind the team.

05:37.404 --> 05:39.306
What? Wait.

05:39.307 --> 05:40.573
I know you're taking me.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.775
Well, you know what,
you do need a pick-me-up,

05:42.776 --> 05:45.511
but you just got out of prison
and you don't have a job.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.213
But your brother Rel
needs a pick-me-up,

05:47.214 --> 05:48.714
'cause he just got separated
from his wife.

05:48.715 --> 05:51.517
So, you know, the problem is we
got two equally depressed kids.

05:51.518 --> 05:54.720
It's hard to figure which one to help.

05:54.721 --> 05:56.555
Sound like you got a Sophie's choice.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.190
I had one of those once.

05:58.191 --> 06:01.394
I was dating two chicks named Sophie.

06:01.395 --> 06:04.096
Well, I could just go
to the game by myself,

06:04.097 --> 06:05.765
use the extra legroom.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.299
Or you could take a third person

06:07.301 --> 06:09.502
so your boys don't have
to fight each other.

06:09.503 --> 06:10.803
You know what, man?

06:10.804 --> 06:12.004
Drinks on the house.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.606
Dad, yo, give me the tickets.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.508
Look, Rel don't even have
to know about it.

06:15.509 --> 06:16.642
Jake ain't coming.

06:16.643 --> 06:18.210
Please, man, I need this.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.812
- What up, playboy?
- What up, fam?

06:19.813 --> 06:21.614
Your dad scored Bulls tickets,

06:21.615 --> 06:24.817
and your brother's trying
to make sure you never find out.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.652
Well played, Jake.

06:26.653 --> 06:28.754
Well, look, if Dad gonna take
anybody to the Bulls game,

06:28.755 --> 06:32.358
it's gonna be me, 'cause I did
something remarkable today.

06:32.359 --> 06:34.226
I reunited Brittany with her mom.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.228
Mm-hmm. It was so powerful, too.

06:36.229 --> 06:39.598
It was... it was like the human
version of Finding Nemo.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.901
Why would you do that, man?

06:41.902 --> 06:44.270
That's stupid. Huh?

06:44.271 --> 06:47.239
You just dropped down
to third place on this.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.909
What do you mean third place?
You know what I mean?

06:49.910 --> 06:52.144
What... Brittany's dad
was gone when sh...

06:52.145 --> 06:53.813
before she was even born, right?

06:53.814 --> 06:55.948
Don't she deserve to have
a relationship with one parent?

06:55.949 --> 06:58.050
Yes, she does.
But Monique ain't the one, man.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.518
She is not a good mom.

06:59.519 --> 07:01.554
She's proven that time and time again.

07:01.555 --> 07:02.988
But people do change, Dad.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.024
Monique can't. It's like Popeye.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.560
Remember he said, "I am what I am"?

07:07.561 --> 07:09.962
Well, she is what she is.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.397
Wait, who's Popeye?

07:11.398 --> 07:15.601
That's the vegan sailor that
solved everything with violence.

07:17.604 --> 07:18.838
Look, Dad, no disrespect,

07:18.839 --> 07:20.840
but I used to hang out at
Brittany's house all the time.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.408
Monique is a lot of fun.

07:22.409 --> 07:23.976
Well, you know, you were a kid.
Of course you had fun.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.377
And Monique was fun.

07:25.379 --> 07:27.380
I remember, one time,
she had a O.J. acquittal party.

07:27.381 --> 07:31.050
If you wore a glove that
didn't fit, you got in free.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.587
But as a mom,

07:34.588 --> 07:36.255
she was a mess.

07:36.256 --> 07:38.491
Guess who she had down
as emergency contact

07:38.492 --> 07:39.592
for-for the school.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.393
Me and your mom.

07:41.395 --> 07:42.928
Wow.

07:42.929 --> 07:44.930
Brittany never told me that.

07:44.931 --> 07:46.365
'Cause she was embarrassed.

07:46.366 --> 07:47.600
Look, one time,

07:47.601 --> 07:49.268
her mother passed out
on the front porch,

07:49.269 --> 07:51.270
and Brittany called me
at 2:00 in the morning,

07:51.271 --> 07:53.139
asking me if I'd help her carry
her mother in the house.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.974
You think that's the kind
of story she wants to share

07:54.975 --> 07:56.776
with her friend?
She's only ten years old.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.444
Look, no, but...

07:58.445 --> 08:01.614
but what I saw today was a...
was a whole new person.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.616
All right.
Well, I hope for Brittany's sake

08:03.617 --> 08:04.784
that you're right.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.418
But you're not, 'cause I am.

08:07.854 --> 08:08.888
And I hope you prove me wrong.

08:08.889 --> 08:11.457
But you won't, 'cause I'm right.

08:14.912 --> 08:18.207
- All right, here you go.
- Ah, Sister Brittany,

08:18.208 --> 08:20.888
you are a lifesaver.

08:20.889 --> 08:23.223
You would not believe
how embarrassing it was for me.

08:23.224 --> 08:24.591
In the middle of my sermon,

08:24.592 --> 08:27.060
one of the buttons
just popped off and...

08:27.062 --> 08:29.429
hit Mother Beatrice right in the eye.

08:29.431 --> 08:30.464
Geez.

08:30.465 --> 08:32.299
She's a bit injured.
But we're good now.

08:32.299 --> 08:35.802
You know, I bought her a purse
to match her eye patch.

08:35.804 --> 08:37.104
Now, I want you to notice.

08:37.105 --> 08:39.006
It wasn't my personal weight
that did that.

08:39.006 --> 08:41.308
You know, that was
the weight of the...

08:41.308 --> 08:42.976
of the Lord's word.

08:42.977 --> 08:44.311
Mm. See, that's what I thought.

08:44.312 --> 08:45.813
That's why I put
some extra space in there,

08:45.814 --> 08:47.314
for the Lord's weight.

08:51.286 --> 08:53.453
Thank you for calling me.

08:53.455 --> 08:55.589
Don't thank me. Thank Rel.

08:55.590 --> 08:57.824
He had to convince me to call you.

08:59.027 --> 09:01.228
This seems a bit uncomfortable,

09:01.229 --> 09:04.398
and I probably shouldn't be
standing here.

09:04.399 --> 09:06.233
So, what I'm-a do,
I'm-a go back there and change.

09:06.234 --> 09:09.736
But before I go, I wouldn't be
the man of God that I am

09:09.737 --> 09:11.872
if I don't pray for y'all.
Come on, Sister Brittany.

09:11.873 --> 09:13.674
Come on. Come around here.

09:13.675 --> 09:15.676
I'm assuming
this is your mother, right?

09:15.677 --> 09:18.946
Hey, ma'am. Okay. Bow your heads.

09:18.947 --> 09:20.681
Father God,

09:20.682 --> 09:22.816
we come to you humble

09:22.817 --> 09:25.719
and hungry for your word.

09:25.720 --> 09:28.188
Brittany's mom
hasn't been there for her,

09:28.189 --> 09:30.090
but, God,
you've seen it before, right?

09:30.091 --> 09:31.658
You've seen it in all our lives.
You know,

09:31.659 --> 09:34.995
my daughter hasn't seen
my ex-wife in decades.

09:34.996 --> 09:38.532
But it's okay, because I had
to be the mama and the daddy.

09:38.533 --> 09:40.300
You know, I had to braid the hair

09:40.301 --> 09:43.804
and-and learn
what a menstrual cycle was.

09:43.805 --> 09:45.806
But I digress.

09:45.807 --> 09:49.176
This ain't about me.

09:49.177 --> 09:51.945
It's about these two, God.

09:51.946 --> 09:54.147
Amen.

09:56.284 --> 09:59.152
Brittany, I was a terrible mom.

09:59.154 --> 10:01.288
I was selfish, I was immature,

10:01.289 --> 10:03.390
and I had a lot of work
to do on myself.

10:03.391 --> 10:05.759
And I was in denial of that.

10:05.760 --> 10:07.327
You know,

10:07.328 --> 10:09.730
you were so good
at taking care of yourself

10:09.731 --> 10:12.132
that I felt like you
didn't even need me.

10:13.194 --> 10:14.801
No, remember when you
were six years old,

10:14.802 --> 10:17.037
you would make
those little scrambled eggs?

10:17.038 --> 10:19.439
Well, those were my hangover cure.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.842
You were so responsible, and...

10:21.843 --> 10:24.077
I just didn't deserve you.

10:24.078 --> 10:27.114
Well, thank you for saying that.

10:27.115 --> 10:30.217
You have no reason to forgive me,

10:30.218 --> 10:32.185
and I'm not asking you to do that.

10:34.989 --> 10:37.724
But, baby, if you
could just give me a chance

10:37.725 --> 10:39.860
to just earn your love
and respect again,

10:39.861 --> 10:42.896
honey, I promise you,
I will do the work.

10:42.897 --> 10:47.434
You know what,
as much as I resented you...

10:47.435 --> 10:49.603
it seems like you grew up.

10:49.604 --> 10:50.904
I have.

10:50.905 --> 10:54.241
Well, if you're serious
about what you're saying...

10:54.242 --> 10:57.110
this time,

10:57.111 --> 11:00.414
I guess I'm open
to giving you a shot, Mom.

11:01.983 --> 11:04.384
Thank you.

11:04.385 --> 11:06.286
Can I hug my baby girl?

11:06.287 --> 11:07.888
Sure, Mom.

11:11.426 --> 11:14.561
Praise God! Mm-mm-mm.

11:14.562 --> 11:17.798
When God shows up, he shows out!

11:17.799 --> 11:19.199
Amen.

11:19.200 --> 11:22.069
Now, look, uh, one of these
buttons might pop off again.

11:22.070 --> 11:24.671
I had a piece of chicken back there.

11:27.408 --> 11:29.676
Oh, look at this. Brittany's mom
just posted a photo

11:29.677 --> 11:31.845
on Instagram of her and Brittany.

11:31.846 --> 11:35.215
Oh, the caption's "Having so
much fun with my daughter."

11:35.216 --> 11:38.018
See, I was right
to bring them together.

11:38.019 --> 11:40.487
I don't think so.

11:40.488 --> 11:42.055
I mean, think about it, man.

11:42.056 --> 11:43.857
When's the last time
we took a picture together

11:43.858 --> 11:46.093
and you posted it and said
we're having a good time?

11:46.094 --> 11:48.995
- Never.
- Exactly.

11:48.997 --> 11:50.797
Instagram is not about having
a good time.

11:50.798 --> 11:53.367
It's people pretending
to have a good time.

11:54.636 --> 11:56.470
But, Dad, you don't even
have Instagram.

11:56.471 --> 11:58.805
I don't need things to know things.

11:58.806 --> 12:02.876
He don't have a job, but you
know what it is, right?

12:06.648 --> 12:10.484
See, people base relationships
on how high the highs are

12:10.485 --> 12:12.018
compared to how low the lows are.

12:12.020 --> 12:15.455
But it's more about how middle-y
are the middles.

12:15.456 --> 12:17.324
Wait, "middle-y are the middles"?

12:17.325 --> 12:18.658
What are you talking about?

12:18.660 --> 12:21.228
This is a middle moment right now.

12:21.229 --> 12:23.196
We're sitting here, playing cards.

12:23.197 --> 12:26.266
Grown men playing Go Fish,
a child's game.

12:26.267 --> 12:28.769
Look, I'm bored to death.

12:28.770 --> 12:31.538
I'm looking at y'all,
I want to fall asleep.

12:31.539 --> 12:33.006
And that's a good thing.

12:33.007 --> 12:34.341
Come on. Take a picture.

12:34.342 --> 12:36.243
See for yourself.

12:36.244 --> 12:40.814
No, no. Not how we're supposed
to look. How we really feel.

12:45.553 --> 12:49.756
See? See? Bored to death.

12:49.757 --> 12:52.659
That's how a family that loves
each other looks.

12:54.062 --> 12:56.730
See, look, if I take one
of y'all to the game,

12:56.731 --> 12:59.566
I-I'm feeling that the
expectations of this game

12:59.567 --> 13:01.368
will get you guys so euphoric

13:01.369 --> 13:03.403
and so high, you'll leave
the game thinking,

13:03.404 --> 13:05.605
"Why, I can-I can take on
the world," but really,

13:05.606 --> 13:08.241
you still don't have a job,

13:08.242 --> 13:10.777
and your woman is still gone.

13:10.778 --> 13:12.846
You can go into a deep,
deep depression

13:12.847 --> 13:14.347
I can't get you out of.

13:14.349 --> 13:16.049
And I ain't paying for all them drugs.

13:16.050 --> 13:17.884
I ain't helping y'all like that.

13:17.885 --> 13:20.887
So I'm gonna take Jake the bartender.

13:22.256 --> 13:26.059
Come on, now. Middles, son. Middles.

13:26.060 --> 13:28.762
Thank you.

13:28.763 --> 13:30.630
Man, this is one of
my favorite stores.

13:30.631 --> 13:32.432
- Yeah.
- I like to walk around

13:32.433 --> 13:34.201
and just imagine my
clothes on these shelves.

13:34.202 --> 13:37.204
And have all the teenagers come
in here shoplifting my stuff.

13:38.606 --> 13:41.308
Honey, your stuff is just as
good as anything in this store.

13:41.309 --> 13:43.443
They should be carrying your designs.

13:43.444 --> 13:45.178
Girl, one day.

13:45.179 --> 13:48.114
Well, maybe that one day is today.

13:48.116 --> 13:50.650
Uh, excuse me?

13:50.651 --> 13:52.953
Hi, sir. Are-are you the manager here?

13:52.954 --> 13:54.855
Ma, what you doing?

13:54.856 --> 13:57.224
I may not have the skills to be a mom,

13:57.225 --> 13:59.392
but what I am is an amazing hustler.

13:59.394 --> 14:01.228
Let me use that skill to help you out.

14:01.229 --> 14:03.530
Well, Mom, Mom.

14:03.531 --> 14:06.199
Just don't take your clothes
off, or his clothes.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.768
I'm William, the department
manager. How can I help you?

14:08.770 --> 14:11.071
Hi, how are you? I'm Doris Johnson.

14:11.072 --> 14:14.007
I'm the fashion agent to the stars.

14:14.008 --> 14:15.308
And this here is my client.

14:15.309 --> 14:17.110
She's a young designer in Chicago,

14:17.111 --> 14:18.645
but it seems like you're not carrying

14:18.646 --> 14:20.480
any of her clothes in here

14:20.481 --> 14:22.883
Oh, well, we're not acquainted
with your client.

14:22.884 --> 14:25.752
Does the name Malia Obama
mean anything to you?

14:27.488 --> 14:28.989
Of course.

14:28.990 --> 14:31.324
Well, who do you think
designed the scarf

14:31.325 --> 14:33.360
that Malia wore at her brunch

14:33.361 --> 14:36.429
the day after her
high school graduation?

14:36.431 --> 14:39.633
I did. I... you know.

14:39.634 --> 14:44.037
The Obamas, they just love
my graduation brunch scarves.

14:44.038 --> 14:47.674
I don't think that graduation
brunch scarves are a thing.

14:47.675 --> 14:51.144
It's a black thing.

14:51.145 --> 14:54.014
So sorry. I had no idea.

14:55.516 --> 14:58.852
You know what?
You are way behind the times,

14:58.853 --> 15:01.188
and your store is gonna be out
of business if you don't get

15:01.189 --> 15:03.590
a designer here that people
actually care about.

15:03.591 --> 15:06.026
Well, uh, maybe we can start
on consignment

15:06.027 --> 15:07.227
with a few of your pieces.

15:07.228 --> 15:09.229
Oh, my God. I'd be so...

15:09.230 --> 15:11.431
Insulted. Insulted.

15:11.432 --> 15:13.934
My client, she's above consignment.

15:13.935 --> 15:15.368
- I am?
- Yeah.

15:15.369 --> 15:16.736
- I am.
- Yes.

15:16.737 --> 15:19.339
You know, you need
to place a real order,

15:19.340 --> 15:21.074
and you need to place it now,

15:21.075 --> 15:23.176
or else I'm gonna have
to call Malia Obama up

15:23.177 --> 15:26.813
and-and tell her that she needs
to tweet that this store sucks.

15:26.814 --> 15:29.516
Ma'am, I just... I can't just...

15:29.517 --> 15:32.786
Okay. Let me ask you something, sir.

15:32.787 --> 15:36.022
Look, how does that feel?

15:36.023 --> 15:39.426
Soft. So soft.

15:39.427 --> 15:42.429
That's exactly what Malia said.

15:42.430 --> 15:45.065
- We'll order ten.
- Mm-hmm.

15:46.968 --> 15:48.635
Ma, that was incredible. Thank you.

15:48.636 --> 15:50.303
- It's like a dream come true.
- Yeah, well,

15:50.304 --> 15:52.643
let's just hope that
they don't Google either of us.

15:52.644 --> 15:54.674
Now, come on, baby.

15:57.852 --> 16:00.627
All right, listen up, y'all.
This is Sophie number two.

16:00.628 --> 16:02.295
She'll be tending bar tonight

16:02.296 --> 16:04.464
while I'm in row four
at the Bulls game

16:04.465 --> 16:06.099
with Rel and Nat's dad,

16:06.100 --> 16:09.469
because he chose me
instead of these two idiots.

16:09.470 --> 16:11.671
Man, come on. Back out, Jake.

16:11.672 --> 16:13.640
Listen, man, Rel already
got dinner tonight.

16:13.641 --> 16:15.108
I don't have nothing to do.

16:15.109 --> 16:17.177
Look, kid. You got played.

16:17.178 --> 16:18.778
That's how it goes.

16:18.780 --> 16:20.280
You think this is the first family

16:20.281 --> 16:22.349
I pulled apart for Bulls tickets?

16:22.350 --> 16:24.184
In '92, I was at the championship,

16:24.185 --> 16:25.685
sitting next to Jordan's dad

16:25.686 --> 16:28.255
while his brother was at home crying.

16:28.256 --> 16:32.225
Well, if y'all need me,
I'll be at home.

16:32.226 --> 16:35.195
And I won't be crying either.

16:35.196 --> 16:38.365
He's gonna cry.

16:38.366 --> 16:40.700
We hustled the hell out of that man.

16:40.701 --> 16:42.669
Oh, you know, hustling is what I do.

16:42.670 --> 16:45.005
Yeah, I know.

16:45.006 --> 16:47.941
There they are. Huh?

16:47.942 --> 16:50.076
How does it feel to be reunited?

16:50.077 --> 16:52.679
Does it feel so good?

16:52.680 --> 16:54.881
You see how I made
a-a song a question?

16:54.882 --> 16:56.449
It's incredible.

16:56.451 --> 16:58.051
And Mom got Stafford & Hodges

16:58.052 --> 16:59.653
to order some of my scarves,

16:59.654 --> 17:03.023
just as long as nobody checks
with Malia Obama.

17:03.024 --> 17:05.492
Rel, thank you so much
for bringing us together.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.662
We're gonna have a good
time at dinner tonight.

17:07.663 --> 17:08.541
Yes.

17:08.542 --> 17:10.564
I'm just sorry your
dad couldn't join us.

17:10.565 --> 17:12.398
He had Bulls tickets.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.733
I'm just a little mad
he didn't invite me.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.303
So I guess you could say, uh,

17:16.304 --> 17:17.838
he took over your role as a deadbeat.

17:20.842 --> 17:22.409
Too soon?

17:25.346 --> 17:27.047
Damn, the alarm at the
store just went off.

17:27.048 --> 17:29.768
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, it should be. It goes off,

17:29.769 --> 17:31.504
like, once a week,
but I still got to go check it.

17:31.505 --> 17:33.205
I'll be back in, like, ten minutes.

17:33.206 --> 17:35.374
- Okay.
- Well, cool. Uh, we'll be here.

17:35.375 --> 17:37.676
- All right.
- Rel, are you gonna let my daughter walk

17:37.677 --> 17:39.678
the streets of Chicago
at night by herself?

17:39.679 --> 17:41.519
- You're a deadbeat friend.
- Oh, I guess it's funny

17:41.520 --> 17:43.821
when a deadbeat tells
a deadbeat joke, huh?

17:43.822 --> 17:44.922
All right.

17:45.958 --> 17:48.026
Come on.

17:48.027 --> 17:49.160
Hi, Jake.

17:49.161 --> 17:51.029
It's been such a long time.

17:51.030 --> 17:52.730
Hey, can I get my usual?

17:52.731 --> 17:55.066
- Of course. I never forget a usual.
- Okay.

17:56.502 --> 17:57.502
Game time!

17:57.503 --> 17:59.003
Come on, Jake, man.

17:59.004 --> 18:00.772
Benny the Bull said
if we got there early,

18:00.773 --> 18:02.674
he'd let us operate the T-shirt gun.

18:02.675 --> 18:05.243
Oh, hell yeah! I'm-a break
somebody's teeth tonight.

18:05.244 --> 18:07.145
Let me get my favorite hat.

18:07.146 --> 18:09.113
Is that Milt?

18:09.114 --> 18:11.716
Damn!

18:11.717 --> 18:13.484
- Monique is in the house.
- Oh.

18:13.485 --> 18:15.486
It's so good to see you.

18:15.487 --> 18:17.422
- Look at you all dressed up.
- Yeah.

18:17.423 --> 18:18.756
You going to a club or something?

18:18.757 --> 18:20.658
Well, no, no.
No more fast life for me.

18:20.659 --> 18:23.161
I'm actually going to dinner
with Rel and Brittany.

18:23.162 --> 18:25.997
Yo, man, let's get out of here.
Tip-off, baby.

18:25.998 --> 18:27.532
All right, man.
Just give me a second, okay?

18:27.533 --> 18:29.033
- Give me a second.
- All right.

18:29.034 --> 18:31.169
Uh, look, I got to say this.
Speaking of Brittany,

18:31.170 --> 18:33.371
you know, uh, she's
in a good place right now.

18:33.372 --> 18:36.074
And, Mo, you took her
through some stuff, you know,

18:36.075 --> 18:38.609
and it hurt me to see her go
through all that, all right?

18:38.611 --> 18:40.244
So if you're gonna be a mother,
you can't have

18:40.245 --> 18:42.880
one foot in and one foot out...
this ain't hokey pokey.

18:42.881 --> 18:44.882
Look, you can't hurt her again, okay?

18:44.883 --> 18:47.618
Now, it's good to see you, all right?

18:48.954 --> 18:50.088
Y-You look good.

18:50.089 --> 18:52.590
- Thank you. Good to see you.
- All right.

18:52.591 --> 18:57.328
What the hell?

18:57.329 --> 18:59.130
My money.

19:02.001 --> 19:03.801
Oh, my God.

19:03.802 --> 19:06.065
Brittany, I'm...
I'm sorry this happened to you.

19:06.066 --> 19:07.583
Why would somebody do this?

19:07.584 --> 19:09.585
I don't know. This is crazy.

19:09.586 --> 19:11.854
Got to call my mom.

19:15.292 --> 19:18.327
Hi, baby. What's up?

19:18.328 --> 19:20.129
Somebody broke into the store.

19:20.130 --> 19:21.297
Are you okay?

19:21.298 --> 19:22.965
No. It's so bad.

19:22.966 --> 19:25.167
Like, everything is messed up,
and I can't...

19:25.168 --> 19:26.368
Can you just come?

19:26.369 --> 19:28.437
Um, okay.

19:28.438 --> 19:29.738
All right, baby, let...

19:29.739 --> 19:32.675
Um, I-I'll be right there, okay?

19:36.012 --> 19:38.948
Oh, man, where is she at?
It's been over an hour.

19:38.949 --> 19:40.249
The police have already been here.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.884
If you can't get here
before the Chicago police,

19:41.885 --> 19:43.819
you're not trying.

19:45.589 --> 19:48.324
Brittany...

19:48.325 --> 19:50.960
Hey, hey, look, um...

19:50.961 --> 19:52.962
I'm-I'm sorry. I should've never,

19:52.963 --> 19:55.864
I should've never pushed you
to reconnect with your mom.

19:55.866 --> 19:57.466
It's not your fault.

19:57.467 --> 20:00.035
This is who she is,
and I should've known.

20:00.036 --> 20:02.304
I mean, she asked me
for another chance,

20:02.305 --> 20:04.807
and I gave it to her, like a dummy.

20:04.808 --> 20:08.243
But when things get tough, she's gone.

20:12.616 --> 20:13.662
Damn.

20:13.663 --> 20:16.852
Dad, what are you doing here?
You're supposed to be

20:16.853 --> 20:19.021
- at the Bulls game.
- I was. Got your text.

20:19.022 --> 20:21.156
I came as soon as I could.
You all right?

20:21.157 --> 20:24.393
- Well, I'm doing, you know...
- Not you!

20:24.394 --> 20:27.129
Thanks for coming.
Sorry you're missing the game.

20:27.130 --> 20:29.498
Hey, hey, I don't care
about that game. Family first.

20:29.499 --> 20:31.333
Family first?
Was it family when, you know,

20:31.334 --> 20:33.168
when it came to those Bulls tickets?

20:33.169 --> 20:35.304
That was me saving us
from some fake joy.

20:35.305 --> 20:38.774
Now, grab a broom,
let's make some real memories.

20:41.344 --> 20:43.812
Why are you standing there
with that silly grin, man?

20:43.813 --> 20:45.514
Help us clean up!

20:50.172 --> 20:52.943
Well, this is a nice present for
your wife, shall I wrap it?

20:52.944 --> 20:54.478
Oh, no, you ain't got to worry
about all that.

20:54.479 --> 20:56.774
I'm-a just go ahead and just
take this with me and just

20:56.775 --> 20:58.543
put this in my pocket.
Okay, have a blessed day.

20:58.544 --> 21:02.079
Oh, excuse me, excuse me.
Um, you haven't paid for that.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.749
Oh, no. I thought I was getting
the pastor's discount, you know,

21:04.750 --> 21:06.851
where I just take it
and I just walk away, you know.

21:06.852 --> 21:09.186
You know, 'cause I got a huge
congregation, so I let them know

21:09.187 --> 21:11.789
this is a store I come to... it's
gonna get you more business.

21:11.790 --> 21:14.525
Sir, take one more step
and I'll call security.

21:15.527 --> 21:18.095
Mm-mm-mm.

21:18.096 --> 21:20.097
Tell you this...

21:20.098 --> 21:22.466
when you show up to the pearly gates

21:22.467 --> 21:24.669
and you got to face God...

21:24.670 --> 21:27.605
he's gonna remember
how you treated me today.

21:27.606 --> 21:31.375
I'm an atheist.
Will that be credit or debit?

21:33.111 --> 21:35.179
- That'll be debit.
- Okay, great.
