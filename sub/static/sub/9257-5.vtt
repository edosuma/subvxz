WEBVTT

00:04.707 --> 00:08.351
–I hear you're the best.
–Heat it up.

00:14.274 --> 00:16.663
What's up, boss?

00:20.194 --> 00:21.754
While you two
were out playing putt-putt…

00:21.794 --> 00:24.314
Shane and me were taking down
a slice-and-dice gem operation…

00:24.354 --> 00:26.811
an Armenian kingpin,
two dozen of his crew.

00:26.851 --> 00:29.018
One guy who shall remain faceless.

00:29.058 --> 00:30.841
I can't believe
we missed out on that, man.

00:30.881 --> 00:33.849
It gets better. It gets better.
We found out the Zeroun family…

00:33.889 --> 00:36.729
isn't only making illegal money,
they're also cleaning and shipping it.

00:36.769 --> 00:39.896
So we're going to take down
a money-laundering ring? Sweet.

00:39.936 --> 00:45.271
Yes, it is. We're gonna bring it down,
pack it up, and save it for a rainy day.

00:45.440 --> 00:48.280
We found out how and where
they distribute their dirty cash.

00:48.320 --> 00:51.193
This is it, boys.
This is the one we've been waiting for.

00:51.233 --> 00:54.137
One big hit. In and out.
We're set for good.

00:54.431 --> 00:56.119
–What?
–Told you he'd be speechless.

00:56.159 --> 00:59.869
You're not serious.
You wanna rip off the Armenian mob?

01:00.128 --> 01:04.666
Shh. We have two months to plan this.
We can absolutely do this.

01:04.830 --> 01:07.734
–No. Not me.
–What are you saying? It's all of us.

01:07.774 --> 01:10.906
No, man. It's crazy.
It can't be that easy.

01:11.135 --> 01:14.327
We'd have the mob chasing us
on one side, the law on the other.

01:14.367 --> 01:16.809
What about you, huh?
You bailing too?

01:16.926 --> 01:20.886
No. No.
It sounds interesting.

01:21.022 --> 01:23.291
Lem, no one's rushing into this.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:32.445 --> 01:34.773
–Do you know a Connie Reisler?
–Yeah. Why?

01:34.813 --> 01:37.976
–She's here.
–Oh, man.

01:43.932 --> 01:47.315
Hi, Vic.

01:50.299 --> 01:53.691
–You're clean.
–Yeah.

01:53.725 --> 01:57.157
–I did 90 in County.
–It must have been hard on you.

01:57.275 --> 01:59.478
It's what I needed.

02:04.602 --> 02:07.057
What do you need from me?

02:07.226 --> 02:11.318
I wanna help you. Provide information
on a professional basis.

02:11.418 --> 02:13.523
Look, Connie…

02:13.690 --> 02:15.316
I'm here for you.

02:15.546 --> 02:17.586
But I don't have throwaway money
like I used to.

02:17.626 --> 02:22.033
I'm talking about making it official.
I met someone inside.

02:22.201 --> 02:24.977
Told me that the state
can give C.Is a contract.

02:25.017 --> 02:27.188
I can do that.

02:27.321 --> 02:31.030
I hear things all the time.

02:34.232 --> 02:35.891
I blend in on the street.

02:37.976 --> 02:39.765
–No.
–Well, I'm tired…

02:39.960 --> 02:42.710
of sucking on pipes and balls, Vic.

02:44.952 --> 02:47.855
You know my résumé.
Who else is gonna give me a job?

02:47.895 --> 02:50.991
–It's not as simple as all that.
–I don't need that much to live on.

02:51.031 --> 02:55.308
Without it, you know,
I gotta go back to trickin'

02:55.478 --> 02:59.188
I start trickin',
it's back to being a junkie.

03:01.687 --> 03:06.258
I heard about this guy…

03:06.487 --> 03:08.270
who's selling heroin to kids.

03:08.310 --> 03:12.368
–Yeah?
–This tip's real solid.

03:13.910 --> 03:16.877
Okay. I'll see what I can do long-term.

03:17.077 --> 03:19.341
In the meantime,
tell me about this dealer.

03:19.381 --> 03:23.853
Teenage kid.
Felipe Gomez.

03:24.053 --> 03:27.795
I know his sister.
He just started dealing to kids.

03:27.989 --> 03:29.996
Where?

03:30.132 --> 03:34.409
Opposite direction. Which of
Newton's laws of motion applies?

03:34.452 --> 03:37.616
Police.
Which one of these kids is Enrique?

03:39.891 --> 03:42.285
Schoolmates say you've been
flashing thumbnail bags of heroin…

03:42.325 --> 03:45.390
that you got
from some guy named Felipe.

03:45.844 --> 03:48.459
–Smack got your tongue, Enrique?
–You got the wrong Enrique.

03:48.499 --> 03:50.923
Oh, really?
Well, let's pat you down then.

03:50.963 --> 03:54.250
–All right.
Up against the wall, “wrong Enrique.”
–Can he do that?

03:54.290 --> 03:57.656
You're in public school, Beaver.
You got no rights.

04:03.154 --> 04:06.217
It wasn't just me, man. Felipe was
hanging out by the east gate…

04:06.257 --> 04:08.842
handing them out to everyone.
–Handing them out?

04:08.882 --> 04:13.072
Giving it away. Like free samples.

04:14.449 --> 04:16.777
I come out to go to work,
and I find my car like this.

04:16.817 --> 04:19.144
What do you expect me to do?
This isn't my district.

04:19.185 --> 04:22.353
Sir, the widow did this.
She knows where I live.

04:22.961 --> 04:24.968
Are you sure it wasn't random?
A prank?

04:25.008 --> 04:28.717
You heard her threaten me.
“Justice will find you.”

04:28.848 --> 04:31.048
Well, you need to file a report
with Hollywood division.

04:31.088 --> 04:33.255
I take those reports.
It's a waste of time.

04:33.295 --> 04:36.463
–If it's her, you need to document it.
–I guess.

04:36.464 --> 04:38.759
Look, not to overburden you,
but the board's been on my case…

04:38.799 --> 04:41.063
to get them Julien's six-month review.

04:41.103 --> 04:43.340
I'm almost finished with it.

04:43.503 --> 04:45.739
I need it today.

04:45.903 --> 04:49.222
We had officers search every student,
every locker.

04:49.262 --> 04:53.222
If they found drugs,
I told them to keep their lockers open.

04:59.917 --> 05:02.953
I think you should
start calling some parents.

05:17.037 --> 05:19.780
I can't believe
Lem's being such a pussy about this.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.932
Uh, who knows.
Maybe he's right.

05:22.029 --> 05:25.574
–We don't need him to pull this off.
–Yes, we do.

05:25.772 --> 05:27.811
Lem doesn't care
if we ride solo on this thing.

05:27.851 --> 05:29.740
Well, I care.

05:29.773 --> 05:33.252
Either we're all in, or we're all out.

05:33.611 --> 05:38.313
One guy knowing who isn't accountable,
isn't an option.

05:38.507 --> 05:41.769
We're a team.
That's the only way it works.

05:43.179 --> 05:47.302
My educational reform
if middle schoolers are high on heroin.

05:47.499 --> 05:50.691
And if the police can't
keep drug dealers out of our schools…

05:50.731 --> 05:52.642
is there anyplace
our children can be safe?

05:52.682 --> 05:54.658
Sir, how do you answer
your political opponent's challenge?

05:54.698 --> 05:57.121
I'm here as a police officer,
not as a candidate.

05:57.161 --> 06:02.464
I want to remedy the situation, not turn it
into political hay. Excuse me.

06:03.689 --> 06:05.793
Jesus, what the hell went down here?

06:05.833 --> 06:09.217
Some scumbag was handing out tastes
of heroin like they were goddamn cookies.

06:09.257 --> 06:11.337
Heroin?

06:11.370 --> 06:14.468
Not your daddy's smack either.
Pure and cheap.

06:14.696 --> 06:18.880
Snort it, smoke it, same high as shooting up
without the float… addictive as shit.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.248
You're responsible for drug busts
in this district.

06:21.288 --> 06:23.999
–I thought you had a handle on things.
–I did.

06:24.039 --> 06:27.405
Then my handle got burnt
at the stake by Armadillo.

06:27.719 --> 06:29.694
That drug dealer, Tio.

06:29.832 --> 06:32.705
You wanna know
what my relationship with him was about?

06:32.745 --> 06:35.104
It was about not letting things
like this happen.

06:35.144 --> 06:38.527
I gave him slack, but I gave him rules.
He never dealt to kids.

06:38.567 --> 06:41.982
With Tio out of the way, somebody else
saw these kids as an untapped market.

06:42.022 --> 06:44.002
–So how do we fix this?
–Well…

06:44.038 --> 06:49.342
No. No more arrangements with drug dealers.
Crack down on them… publicly and hard.

06:49.382 --> 06:51.749
I can do that too.

06:58.309 --> 07:00.553
Police!
Get your hands in the air!

07:03.685 --> 07:06.271
–Down! Down! Get down!
–Get down!

07:10.884 --> 07:15.553
Word is you think
you can start selling at schools.

07:17.412 --> 07:19.713
Turn kids to clients.

07:28.323 --> 07:30.046
Nope. No heroin here.

07:34.339 --> 07:36.378
Here either, boss.

07:37.539 --> 07:39.808
None in here either, boss.

07:41.602 --> 07:45.017
“A,” “B,” “A,” “B,”
“A,” “B,” “A,” “B.”

07:45.186 --> 07:47.193
“A,” “B,” “A,” “B,” “A.”

07:47.330 --> 07:51.224
All the “A's,” on your feet.

07:51.361 --> 07:55.993
Tell your fellow Torrucos that the next
asshole I catch selling dope to kids…

07:56.033 --> 07:59.742
I'm gonna find a soft, dark place
to jam this stick.

07:59.937 --> 08:02.009
Now get out.

08:02.145 --> 08:04.894
“B's” on your feet.

08:05.025 --> 08:08.655
You're all busted! Whoa.
Whoa. Felipe, where you going?

08:10.048 --> 08:11.968
You're not an “A.”

08:12.001 --> 08:14.616
You were handing out samples
at Truman East Middle School today…

08:14.656 --> 08:17.824
which makes you a special kind
of “B”… my bitch.

08:20.224 --> 08:22.712
–This guy's probably gonna need a medic.
–Okay. Call it in.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.655
Get the rest of these guys
carred and barred.

08:25.695 --> 08:29.818
–One-Tango-13, we need an R.A.
–Hello, Officer.

08:29.919 --> 08:33.015
–Can I help you?
–You work with a Detective Mackey?

08:33.056 --> 08:36.764
–Maybe. Why?
–I sometimes have information for him.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.900
–You one of his C.Is?
–Not officially.

08:40.094 --> 08:42.140
I need to get a message to him.

08:42.143 --> 08:44.853
I lost his number
and, uh, it's important.

08:44.893 --> 08:49.268
–What's the message?
–The guy he's looking for isn't stopping.

08:49.437 --> 08:54.357
And I'm afraid if Vic isn't careful,
he might start talking.

08:54.492 --> 08:57.176
–That's the message?
–Mmm.

08:58.781 --> 09:00.537
What's your name?

09:02.236 --> 09:05.203
Tell him about the face.
He'll know.

09:10.044 --> 09:13.397
Look at you, Felipe.
You barely got hair on your nads…

09:13.437 --> 09:15.764
and you're already dealing
hard stuff to kids.

09:15.804 --> 09:18.007
I'm not going to jail.

09:18.171 --> 09:20.051
What fantasy world are you living in?

09:20.091 --> 09:23.222
I'm 15.
Minors don't get time.

09:23.355 --> 09:25.299
Unless the crime's serious enough.

09:25.339 --> 09:29.330
You moved heavy weights of “H,” amigo.
To hundreds of kids. You're done.

09:29.370 --> 09:32.599
–But… But I'm a minor.
–In a major pile of shit.

09:32.762 --> 09:35.930
–But… But I was told that…
–You were told wrong!

09:38.330 --> 09:42.007
It's all right. You can cry.
You wouldn't be the first.

09:42.585 --> 09:44.881
And you damn sure
won't be the last.

09:44.921 --> 09:47.059
Nah.

09:47.193 --> 09:50.160
Everybody's got game on the street.

09:51.736 --> 09:55.031
Then you get caught.
Reality sets in.

09:55.193 --> 09:57.041
Life as you know it is over.

09:57.177 --> 10:01.202
–I was just following orders.
–I know.

10:01.336 --> 10:05.424
–Go ahead. Let it all out.
–You don't understand.
You can't say no to him.

10:05.464 --> 10:08.049
–To who?
–Armadillo.

10:09.208 --> 10:12.376
You work for Armadillo?
You've seen him in town?

10:12.567 --> 10:14.127
No. Everything goes through Duardo.

10:14.167 --> 10:18.062
–You know where we can find Armadillo?
–No, but Duardo would.

10:18.102 --> 10:21.776
–Armadillo's back?
–You start kids off for free,
get customers for life.

10:21.816 --> 10:25.908
–I'm throwing everyone I have on this.
–No. You can't do that.

10:26.006 --> 10:29.134
–Why not?
–The last time you couldn't
read between the lines…

10:29.174 --> 10:31.534
so this time let me
draw you a clear picture.

10:31.574 --> 10:34.830
Keep other cops…
Claudette especially… off my ass.

10:34.870 --> 10:39.277
–What's your plan?
–Armadillo knows the law.

10:39.477 --> 10:43.181
He's using minors to distribute
because they can't serve major time.

10:43.221 --> 10:47.917
He'll also know that they can't be used as
undercover C.Is in a major sting operation.

10:47.957 --> 10:50.029
Okay.

10:50.165 --> 10:53.677
I use Felipe as an undercover informant.

10:53.876 --> 10:56.270
He leads us to Duardo.
Duardo leads us to Armadillo.

10:56.310 --> 10:59.468
–Absolutely not.
–Are we going to do this or aren't we?

10:59.508 --> 11:01.933
I'm for doing it in a way
that will actually secure a conviction.

11:01.973 --> 11:05.323
–It's illegal.
–My way would be more of a gray area.

11:05.363 --> 11:08.717
The last time we used a kid,
Armadillo raped and tattooed her.

11:08.757 --> 11:11.083
Think of something else,
and do it fast…

11:11.123 --> 11:14.687
or I am putting every unit I got
on tracking him down.

11:18.802 --> 11:21.552
–Vic.
–What can I do for you, gorgeous?

11:21.618 --> 11:24.258
–Got a message for you.
–Yeah, from who?

11:24.274 --> 11:26.634
I guess you know the guy.
Left side of his face was scarred…

11:26.674 --> 11:29.935
like he'd been in some sort
of fire or something.

11:30.097 --> 11:32.341
Armadillo's declaring goddamn war.

11:32.402 --> 11:34.761
What does he mean,
“You don't want him talking”?

11:34.801 --> 11:36.714
Means he's gonna explain
the grill marks on his face.

11:36.754 --> 11:39.433
Talk about how we were
protecting his drug competition.

11:39.473 --> 11:41.673
–If somebody else finds him before us…
–Can't happen.

11:41.713 --> 11:45.416
–We have to find him first.
–And what? Hand him over to Aceveda?

11:45.456 --> 11:49.285
He'll pull his gun.
We'll have no choice.

11:52.784 --> 11:55.434
–You see a better way?
–No.

11:57.039 --> 12:00.360
Asshole should have gone back to Mexico
like you told him.

12:00.400 --> 12:03.911
–What about Lem?
–He's not down with
ripping off the money train.

12:03.951 --> 12:06.567
How the hell you think
he's gonna feel about this?

12:06.607 --> 12:11.142
Keep 'im away from the action. Watching the
door or something. You know the drill.

12:11.182 --> 12:12.873
What's up?

12:15.759 --> 12:19.323
–What's goin' on?
–Aceveda wants us to find Armadillo.

12:19.470 --> 12:23.034
We're just trying to figure out
the best way to do it.

12:24.910 --> 12:28.325
My grandfather had Alzheimer's.
I know how hard it is.

12:28.365 --> 12:31.717
I was only gone an hour. I mean,
the cleaning lady said she'd watch her.

12:31.757 --> 12:34.125
We'll find her.
I promise.

12:34.158 --> 12:37.093
Is there anyplace where she might go?
People she might visit?

12:37.133 --> 12:40.100
No. Most of her friends
have been moved or passed away.

12:40.140 --> 12:41.989
–Any other family members in town?
–No.

12:42.029 --> 12:45.508
–I'm her only child.
–Good news is I talked
to the morgue and hospitals.

12:45.548 --> 12:48.417
No matches on a Jeannie Sutton.

12:48.556 --> 12:50.918
Listen, uh,
we've notified our patrol cars.

12:50.958 --> 12:53.924
We're going to distribute a flyer
with your mom's photo.

12:53.964 --> 12:55.947
Someone will find her.

12:55.981 --> 12:59.611
Dutch and I will oversee the search
until someone does.

13:04.170 --> 13:07.210
Hey.

13:07.244 --> 13:11.006
–Uh, you busy a week from Sunday?
–I don't think so. Why?

13:12.746 --> 13:16.063
–Actually, I'm getting married.
–Married? To who?

13:16.554 --> 13:19.362
–Vanessa.
–The mom you've been seeing, like,
for a month?

13:19.402 --> 13:23.098
–It's been seven weeks.
–Please, tell me this is a joke.

13:23.145 --> 13:25.447
Uh, no. I love her.
She loves me.

13:25.642 --> 13:27.943
Julien. Jesus.

13:28.105 --> 13:30.439
–How goes it?
–Good. Good.

13:30.601 --> 13:33.382
–I'm getting married.
–Holy crap.

13:33.576 --> 13:35.518
–Yeah.
–Congratulations.

13:35.656 --> 13:37.376
–Thanks.
–Better you than me.

13:37.416 --> 13:39.456
Yeah, that's what I hear.

13:41.001 --> 13:43.443
Look, it's gonna be a small ceremony…

13:43.464 --> 13:46.693
but I really want you to be there.
–Julien…

13:46.984 --> 13:49.983
you are gay.
–No. I was misguided.

13:50.055 --> 13:52.799
But with the help of God,
I'm now on the right path.

13:52.839 --> 13:55.360
I've heard all about that reorientation crap.
It's completely twisted.

13:55.400 --> 13:58.983
–That is just anti-religious propaganda.
–Julien…

13:59.017 --> 14:02.079
–They are not helping you.
–They are helping me.

14:02.119 --> 14:06.277
I just need to know whether or not
you're coming to my wedding.

14:06.342 --> 14:09.180
She took three bags
of candy and then what?

14:09.318 --> 14:12.062
Then I yelled at her to stop and pay me.
But she was really out of it.

14:12.102 --> 14:14.590
You know, like, loco?

14:14.790 --> 14:16.383
I was really worried about her.

14:16.423 --> 14:19.069
If you were so worried about her,
why didn't you stop her?

14:19.109 --> 14:22.739
I'm gonna tackle some old lady?
I called you, didn't I?

14:23.941 --> 14:26.653
Yeah, I know that store.
My mom used to work there.

14:26.693 --> 14:29.532
–She did?
–Yeah. A long time ago.
Used to be a soda shop…

14:29.572 --> 14:32.060
called something else,
but that was her first job.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.674
What other things did she do back then?

14:35.717 --> 14:38.885
–Where've you been?
–Uh, I felt like a sandwich.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.468
Your break was over two hours ago.
We've got a case here.

14:41.508 --> 14:45.187
I was hungry.
And I wouldn't exactly call this a case.

14:45.221 --> 14:48.508
Jeannie was spotted in a store
she used to work in as a teenager.

14:48.548 --> 14:51.867
Now, if she's in a delusional state,
she might be going back into her past.

14:51.907 --> 14:53.915
–If we do our homework…
–Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:53.955 --> 14:57.789
We're not going to find her by
psychoanalyzing the last 60 years of her life.

14:57.829 --> 15:00.410
God knows how many
defining moments she's had.

15:00.450 --> 15:03.420
–You have another theory, pitch it out.
–She's an old, white lady…

15:03.460 --> 15:06.746
wondering around in a black and Hispanic
neighborhood in pajamas and slippers.

15:06.786 --> 15:09.917
–Somebody's gonna call her in.
–Detectives.

15:10.081 --> 15:13.497
Someone spotted your woman trying to get
into a locked apartment an hour ago.

15:13.537 --> 15:15.741
960 Chester Avenue, number 16.

15:15.905 --> 15:20.444
–See?
–How much you wanna bet
that's a blast from the past?

15:23.841 --> 15:26.590
–Uh, excuse me?
–Yeah, excuse you.

15:26.785 --> 15:31.141
No, asshole. You bump into somebody,
show some manners. Apologize.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.687
–That's funny to you?
–Yeah.

15:33.824 --> 15:37.850
How funny would it be
if I knocked those oversized teeth out?

15:38.687 --> 15:42.327
Why don't you back up, Dutch-boy, before
you find my boot print halfway up your ass?

15:42.367 --> 15:46.557
Whoa. We got more important
things to do. Come on.

15:46.751 --> 15:52.493
–What's the matter with you?
–Nothing. Just not going to
take shit from people anymore.

15:53.726 --> 15:56.857
–Come on, man.
–That's not my lawyer, bro.

15:58.174 --> 15:59.962
Sit down.

16:05.149 --> 16:07.989
Your baby brother's
stupid enough to stay in town.

16:08.029 --> 16:11.131
You tell him that
I got some new rules for him.

16:11.389 --> 16:14.935
–No more dealing to kids.
–I don't talk to Armadillo.

16:15.101 --> 16:18.461
You can get him word.
Farmington is my house.

16:18.494 --> 16:21.464
Nothin' gets dealt there
without my approval.

16:23.196 --> 16:27.540
You keep it away from the kids.
There's plenty of junkies to go around.

16:27.580 --> 16:29.783
Armadillo doesn't like rules.

16:29.948 --> 16:32.698
See that One-niner over there?

16:34.268 --> 16:36.851
I've done a few favors for his crew
out on the street.

16:36.891 --> 16:39.379
He's willing to pay me back.

16:39.548 --> 16:42.896
One phone call from me
and you're greenlit.

16:43.067 --> 16:47.802
–Greenlit?
–It's an American prison term.

16:47.836 --> 16:50.450
It means you'll be
shanked in the shower, asshole.

16:50.490 --> 16:54.714
Bleed out before the guards
even know you're late for breakfast.

17:00.346 --> 17:03.257
You tell Armadillo about my new rules…

17:03.291 --> 17:07.632
and if he says one thing
about me or my crew…

17:08.185 --> 17:10.487
I'll make that call.

17:17.977 --> 17:21.718
–You greenlit Navaro?
–No. I just threatened to.

17:21.912 --> 17:23.601
Greenlighting Navaro's a bluff.
Hopefully…

17:23.641 --> 17:26.544
it'll get him to contact Armadillo,
give us his location.

17:26.584 --> 17:29.008
If Navaro or any of his crew
make a call, the county guards…

17:29.048 --> 17:31.311
will monitor it and let us listen in.

17:31.351 --> 17:34.031
–Ronnie, work on tracking those calls.
–I'll wire us up.

17:34.071 --> 17:38.064
And if Armadillo's
on the other end, we just bring him in?

17:38.231 --> 17:40.207
I mean, what if he talks about,
you know?

17:40.247 --> 17:42.799
We're cops. He's a fugitive.
We got a job to do.

17:42.839 --> 17:45.998
–I don't know, man.
–Maybe he'll buy this whole
greenlighting thing.

17:46.038 --> 17:48.678
Keep his mouth shut to save his brother.

17:49.718 --> 17:51.474
Okay.

17:53.270 --> 17:55.949
She was banging on my door.
Jiggling the knob.

17:55.989 --> 17:58.701
I opened up, and she just
started yelling, “Who are you?”

17:58.741 --> 18:01.043
This the woman?

18:02.933 --> 18:06.795
Crazy.
Yeah, that's her.

18:06.997 --> 18:10.313
She was babbling mostly.
Kept asking about Earl.

18:10.356 --> 18:14.928
–Earl?
–Yeah. “Where's Earl?” That's what she said.

18:15.188 --> 18:19.595
Earl, you lived in Apartment 16,
960 Chester Avenue?

18:19.796 --> 18:23.308
–Yeah, a long time ago.
–1946 to 1948?

18:23.508 --> 18:25.395
If you say so.

18:25.429 --> 18:28.297
–Do you remember a Jeannie Sutton?
–No.

18:29.715 --> 18:32.107
What about her maiden name,
Jeannie Russell?

18:32.147 --> 18:35.791
Jeannie Russell.
Yeah, her I remember.

18:35.987 --> 18:38.191
You date her?

18:38.355 --> 18:42.184
Yeah, for about a year on and off.

18:42.322 --> 18:43.849
Right after the war.

18:44.018 --> 18:47.334
–I met her at a soda shop she worked at.
–Mmm.

18:47.538 --> 18:51.661
–You two keep in touch?
–No, no. I haven't seen her since…

18:51.794 --> 18:54.030
I don't know.

18:54.193 --> 18:57.385
But if she still looks as good
as she used to, give her my number.

18:57.425 --> 19:02.217
Well, Earl, Jeannie has Alzheimer's now.
She's lost. We're trying to find her.

19:02.257 --> 19:04.616
–Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
–Detective.

19:04.656 --> 19:06.825
We think she might try to contact you.

19:06.865 --> 19:11.720
–If she does, would you give us a call?
–Oh, absolutely.

19:11.856 --> 19:16.360
A civilian saw one of my flyers. Called in, said
she saw Jeannie hanging around Echo Park.

19:16.400 --> 19:19.978
–Sorry to waste your time.
–Thanks.

19:20.175 --> 19:21.899
This is a C.I contract.

19:22.095 --> 19:24.713
D.A's grateful for your school tip.

19:24.911 --> 19:28.391
You'll be required
to provide four tips every month.

19:28.591 --> 19:30.893
Tips that lead to arrests.

19:32.111 --> 19:34.630
–And I get paid?
–Two thousand a month.

19:34.670 --> 19:37.550
It's not free money, Connie.

19:37.584 --> 19:41.478
Four tips every month, and you gotta
stay legit. You'll be tested at random.

19:41.518 --> 19:46.022
–Why are they gonna test me?
–Because they care where their money goes.

19:46.062 --> 19:48.266
–Why, you worried?
–No.

19:48.430 --> 19:51.928
I just don't like peeing in a cup
three times a week.

19:54.637 --> 19:58.793
–When do I get my check?
–As soon as you give us a tip.

19:58.925 --> 20:02.056
–I gave you a tip.
–That was in good faith.

20:02.189 --> 20:04.367
Clock starts as soon as you sign.

20:14.475 --> 20:16.264
I'll take a look.

20:22.667 --> 20:24.161
What happened?

20:24.331 --> 20:27.874
A three year old opened a packet
of candy from his brother's backpack.

20:27.914 --> 20:31.427
–Except it wasn't candy.
–The free “H”?

20:31.626 --> 20:33.961
–Jesus Christ.
–Poor kid.

20:34.123 --> 20:36.866
His brother over there
says he got it from school.

20:36.906 --> 20:39.202
He's too young to go to Truman East.

20:39.242 --> 20:42.806
He doesn't go to Truman East.
He goes to South Torres.

20:42.985 --> 20:45.761
Armadillo's running this shit
through the grade schools too?

20:45.801 --> 20:48.897
I'm sick of this. Whatever you're
going to do, do it quick.

20:48.937 --> 20:51.169
–I've already done it.
–Well, do more.

20:51.209 --> 20:54.121
–Yeah, like what?
–I don't know. Anything.

20:54.155 --> 20:56.705
You can't use Felipe
in an undercover capacity.

20:56.745 --> 20:59.552
Even though he'd lead us
to Armadillo, he's a minor.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.341
And it's illegal to use a minor as a C.I.

21:02.569 --> 21:04.903
Right.

21:18.951 --> 21:21.950
How'd that two hours in the cage feel?

21:22.087 --> 21:26.309
Huh? How's 20 years gonna feel?

21:26.470 --> 21:28.574
I can't go when someone's watching me.

21:28.614 --> 21:32.127
You better get used to it.

21:32.326 --> 21:34.834
I'm gonna be watching you for a while.

21:34.950 --> 21:37.121
Wh-What do you mean?

21:37.254 --> 21:39.774
You're gonna do a good deed, Felipe.

21:40.038 --> 21:43.201
Make the Boys Club proud.

21:43.301 --> 21:45.472
What kind of good deed?

21:47.173 --> 21:50.047
The State of California has a problem
with me using minors undercover…

21:50.087 --> 21:52.893
so technically,
we're just gonna let you go free.

21:52.933 --> 21:56.129
Keep an eye on you…
for your own safety.

21:56.325 --> 21:58.081
Keep an eye on me?

21:58.180 --> 22:02.084
You try to lose us,
you go right back in the can.

22:02.118 --> 22:06.738
You're gonna reconnect with Duardo,
find out where Armadillo's hiding.

22:13.219 --> 22:15.007
Yo, ma'am, shuffle broad.

22:15.203 --> 22:17.308
Hey! Hey, hey!
Police. Hold it.

22:18.883 --> 22:22.458
Hey, who taught you you could
treat an old woman like that?

22:22.498 --> 22:26.074
She can't tell. Crawling around,
clawing at the sidewalk.

22:26.114 --> 22:29.856
–She's crazy.
–Okay, honey. It's all right.

22:30.050 --> 22:32.378
–Get out of here. Go on.
–We'll get you home to your daughter.

22:32.418 --> 22:34.589
You all right?

22:36.897 --> 22:38.685
Got her.

22:40.321 --> 22:43.769
–Danny, right?
–Hi.

22:43.937 --> 22:47.100
Vanessa. We met before.
Is Julien around?

22:47.297 --> 22:51.512
–Uh, he should be right back.
–We're going over floral arrangements
for the wedding.

22:51.552 --> 22:53.853
Right. Congratulations.

22:54.016 --> 22:56.667
Thanks.
It's all happening so fast.

22:56.864 --> 23:00.060
Yeah. Well, Julien's a special guy.

23:00.224 --> 23:04.376
I have never met a man with such integrity.
He's gonna make a great father for Randall.

23:04.416 --> 23:06.455
I'm really lucky.

23:06.591 --> 23:08.599
Hi.

23:15.487 --> 23:17.429
–You ready?
–Yeah.

23:17.566 --> 23:20.915
Hey, Julien,
can I see you for a sec first?

23:21.086 --> 23:22.875
I'll meet you at the car.

23:24.350 --> 23:27.637
–My God. You haven't told her yet?
–It's not necessary.

23:27.677 --> 23:30.198
Julien, she is a single woman
with a child.

23:30.238 --> 23:33.973
–It's in my past. It is not important.
–She has a right to know.

23:34.013 --> 23:37.525
–Every mistake I've ever made?
–About something
as important as this? Absolutely.

23:37.565 --> 23:43.043
So you tell every man you've been with
about every shameful thing you've ever done?

23:43.933 --> 23:48.157
You know what? If you don't
tell her before the wedding, I will.

23:54.428 --> 23:57.332
–What are you gonna do with your cut?
–What?

23:57.468 --> 23:59.285
Your cut.
From the money train.

23:59.325 --> 24:02.163
Look, we discuss this
only when we have to.

24:02.491 --> 24:06.583
The more we talk about it,
the more chance someone else hears.

24:08.379 --> 24:11.283
–Our fugitive's calling in.
–Yeah, I got it.

24:15.578 --> 24:20.051
I'm telling you, this money train?
It's a sure thing.

24:20.378 --> 24:24.177
Taking mob money… that's not
why I signed up, joined the force.

24:24.217 --> 24:28.045
Goddamn. You get any softer,
you're gonna start lactating.

24:28.057 --> 24:31.793
You know, all the stuff we've been into,
there was a reason, a point to it.

24:31.833 --> 24:33.524
Where's the good in this?

24:33.753 --> 24:35.921
Money in our pockets
instead of those Balkan bastards.

24:35.961 --> 24:38.382
I don't know, man.

24:40.313 --> 24:43.062
You think I'm doing this for me?

24:43.256 --> 24:46.485
Vic's got a sick kid,
tuition payments…

24:46.648 --> 24:48.622
doctor bills kicking his ass.

24:50.487 --> 24:52.815
I mean,
the guy could be facing a divorce.

24:52.855 --> 24:54.895
He really needs this.

24:56.567 --> 24:59.731
–Heroin in grade school.
–It's awful.

24:59.863 --> 25:02.127
I'm gonna have to go on the attack now.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.916
Find a way to turn this into votes.

25:07.031 --> 25:09.813
Baby, what's wrong?

25:10.006 --> 25:14.097
–I don't know how I got here.
–Hard work. Intelligence.

25:14.230 --> 25:17.454
–That's not what I meant.
–You'll catch whoever's doing this.

25:17.494 --> 25:20.527
–Or Mackey will.
–Mackey?

25:20.661 --> 25:22.417
It's his investigation.

25:22.613 --> 25:24.718
–Can you trust him?
–No.

25:26.037 --> 25:28.589
–Then why?
–It made sense when it started.

25:28.629 --> 25:30.893
And now there's so many loose threads…

25:30.933 --> 25:33.682
To even pull just one…

25:33.876 --> 25:37.105
–Oh, Christ.
–David. You're gonna win.

25:37.268 --> 25:42.090
Well, that's what
everyone keeps telling me.

25:42.228 --> 25:46.668
And if I don't, I embarrass myself…
embarrass you.

25:46.963 --> 25:50.283
We have a daughter.
The only way you would embarrass me…

25:50.323 --> 25:52.237
was if you weren't doing
everything you could…

25:52.277 --> 25:54.347
to make those schools
as safe as possible.

25:54.387 --> 25:56.875
Are you?

25:57.075 --> 25:58.830
No.

25:59.027 --> 26:02.191
What's stopping you?

26:02.355 --> 26:06.777
I want a wide net.
Hit the streets hard.
Check out all the schools.

26:06.898 --> 26:10.217
Grill every kid who got a free sample
and find out where they got it.

26:10.257 --> 26:12.297
Sooner or later,
it's gonna lead us to Armadillo.

26:12.337 --> 26:15.242
All right? Talk to all the gang-bangers
who got pushed out…

26:15.282 --> 26:20.071
when the Torrucos consolidated
and call me with anything.

26:20.209 --> 26:22.183
All right. Let's go.

26:24.465 --> 26:26.001
Armadillo's in town?

26:26.034 --> 26:28.937
Yeah. He's the one
dealing drugs in the schools.

26:28.977 --> 26:31.432
–And you didn't tell me?
–I just found out.

26:31.472 --> 26:35.563
–I need to talk to him.
–I know.

26:35.696 --> 26:38.663
And as soon as I find him,
you'll get first shot.

26:38.703 --> 26:40.552
And you and Mackey won't interfere?

26:40.592 --> 26:43.079
No one will get in your way.

26:49.104 --> 26:52.999
We'll give you a head start. You go in
and ask for a new batch of samples.

26:53.039 --> 26:55.046
Phone.

26:57.806 --> 26:59.654
I'll call you
10 minutes after you're in.

26:59.694 --> 27:03.494
If the drugs are visible,
you pick up and say something clever.

27:03.534 --> 27:05.893
If you don't answer,
I'll know they're not out.

27:05.933 --> 27:08.869
–I'll keep calling until you pick up.
–Then what?

27:08.909 --> 27:11.687
We'll make a little house call.
Pick up you and your buddies.

27:11.727 --> 27:15.013
Once we get you back to the barn,
we cut you loose because you're a minor.

27:15.053 --> 27:19.909
–No one knows we had this little arrangement.
–Okay.

27:23.341 --> 27:26.340
–Cheers, little “G.”
–Cheers.

27:29.421 --> 27:33.130
–Thirsty, huh?
–Yeah, I guess so.

27:34.796 --> 27:38.883
Hey I got some kids asking for more of
that stuff. I guess they like that shit.

27:38.923 --> 27:41.508
All right, all right.

27:47.179 --> 27:50.342
Cost them 20 now. Got that?

27:50.539 --> 27:52.515
–Yeah, yeah. I got it.
–All right.

27:52.555 --> 27:55.657
Yo, give him something
to carry this with, man.

27:59.562 --> 28:03.140
Yo.

28:03.337 --> 28:05.911
What, bitch?
I told you not to call me.

28:07.498 --> 28:10.996
–Little “G” settin'
the ho's straight already.
–Yeah.

28:27.048 --> 28:29.153
Hey, wh-what's the matter, dog?

28:29.288 --> 28:31.968
That's what I wanna know.
Let's see who called you.

28:32.008 --> 28:33.951
Get down!
Down on the ground. Down!

28:33.991 --> 28:36.293
Stay down!

28:45.318 --> 28:48.580
–You're dead.
–Shut up!

28:50.214 --> 28:54.305
–You okay?
–No. I'm dead.

28:58.949 --> 29:01.404
You wanted to see me?

29:01.574 --> 29:03.941
Uh, yeah.
Close the door, please.

29:08.677 --> 29:11.977
–I just got a call from the police.
–About my car?

29:14.276 --> 29:16.284
Sit down, Danny.

29:19.557 --> 29:23.298
–What?
–The call was from Maryland.
Your mother died.

29:23.524 --> 29:27.550
–A car accident.
–What?

29:27.684 --> 29:31.393
I'm so sorry.

29:31.459 --> 29:35.518
–Can I call my dad?
–Yeah. I'll be outside.

29:47.395 --> 29:51.355
Dad. It's me.

29:51.490 --> 29:54.874
It was a goddamn prank.
It was a prank. My mother's fine.

29:54.914 --> 29:57.051
–Slow down. What?
–I want that bitch's records subpoenaed.

29:57.091 --> 29:58.971
–We have to prove that
she made that phone call.
–Danny, stop.

29:59.011 --> 30:01.529
–I want a cop tailing her.
–Just calm down.

30:01.569 --> 30:05.017
She destroys my car, and then she tries
to ruin my career. Now it's my family.

30:05.057 --> 30:09.347
Okay. All right. We'll take care of this.
I'll take care of this.

30:10.816 --> 30:13.850
–The doctor said she can go home now.
–Great.

30:13.984 --> 30:16.984
–Thank you for all you did.
–Anne, hold on a second.

30:17.024 --> 30:20.390
Your mom must have been 17, 18
when she dated Earl?

30:20.576 --> 30:22.648
Pretty conservative times back then.

30:22.688 --> 30:25.306
–Excuse me?
–Dutch.

30:25.503 --> 30:27.928
You said she was going back
into her past. I didn't believe you.

30:27.968 --> 30:30.711
But then Jeannie went back
to the store she used to work at…

30:30.751 --> 30:33.271
an apartment
where her old boyfriend lived.

30:33.311 --> 30:36.407
So why go back to a piece
of sidewalk in Echo Park?

30:36.447 --> 30:39.127
–Why?
–According to the L.A Times archives…

30:39.167 --> 30:44.183
a newborn baby was found smothered to death
in that park, November 18, 1947.

30:44.446 --> 30:46.355
Buried in a shallow grave.

30:46.494 --> 30:49.560
You wanna know
where that grave was located?

30:49.693 --> 30:52.630
Right where your mother sat today,
clawing at the asphalt.

30:52.670 --> 30:55.768
They built a sidewalk over the garden.

30:55.902 --> 30:58.651
Three blocks from Earl's old apartment.

30:59.837 --> 31:02.139
No.

31:02.301 --> 31:07.185
–That's impossible.
–Someone in there helped
kill a baby boy, didn't they?

31:11.388 --> 31:13.268
I'm not even going to
waste my time with you.

31:13.308 --> 31:15.987
You're running Armadillo's drugs
through the schools. Where is he?

31:16.027 --> 31:18.580
Arma who?

31:21.243 --> 31:23.447
Tell me. Tell me.

31:23.644 --> 31:26.578
Vic!

31:26.715 --> 31:29.366
–Vic, open this door.
–Cállete.

31:29.562 --> 31:31.734
You ready?

31:33.402 --> 31:36.636
–What's going on?
–I'm interrogating the suspect.

31:36.666 --> 31:38.802
Duardo here runs the drugs
through the schools.

31:38.842 --> 31:42.068
–Isn't that right?
–I'm taking him back to the barn.

31:42.108 --> 31:45.393
–I'm not done.
–I'm taking him with me. Hand him over.

31:45.433 --> 31:47.157
Come here.

31:51.834 --> 31:55.697
You gave me the green light
to get Armadillo. I'm one step away.

31:55.737 --> 31:58.130
I'm a little uncomfortable
with the steps you're now taking.

31:58.170 --> 32:01.041
I saw the underage C.I outside.
His cover's been blown?

32:01.081 --> 32:02.930
We both knew that was a risk.

32:02.970 --> 32:05.904
You've done a good job getting this far.
I just need to take it from here.

32:05.944 --> 32:09.208
–Hey, you want Armadillo or not?
–I do.

32:09.242 --> 32:11.407
–And Claudette and I will get him.
–Claudette?

32:11.447 --> 32:15.375
She overheard.
There's nothing I can do about it.

32:15.512 --> 32:17.615
We've got to do it by the book now.

32:17.655 --> 32:20.437
Shane, put him in my car.

32:31.287 --> 32:35.378
I spoke to Aceveda.
He said I passed my performance review.

32:35.478 --> 32:37.366
You deserve to.

32:37.399 --> 32:40.653
He also said I had communication and stress
management issues that need addressing.

32:40.693 --> 32:44.813
–Look, you passed. Okay?
–This is because I didn't
cover you on that shooting.

32:44.853 --> 32:47.309
You still think
I'm holding that over you?

32:47.349 --> 32:49.742
–Or maybe it's because I'm getting married.
–It's because it's the truth.

32:49.782 --> 32:53.005
Look, I think it's about something else.
Maybe it's because somebody's…

32:53.045 --> 32:56.397
messing with your car or they called on your
mom, and you're going to take it out on me?

32:56.437 --> 32:58.252
Hey, you are way past out of line.

32:58.292 --> 33:01.772
I deserved higher marks on that.
That… That review goes on my jacket.

33:01.812 --> 33:04.972
Truth is, Julien, I could've been
a whole lot tougher on you.

33:05.012 --> 33:07.628
Your inability to communicate
is a serious problem.

33:07.668 --> 33:10.508
You have this bottled-up pressure
because of your personal life…

33:10.548 --> 33:14.159
and no release valve.

33:14.355 --> 33:18.577
Things I've seen…
Your review could have been a lot worse.

33:18.738 --> 33:21.580
I thought about
what you said about Vanessa.

33:21.620 --> 33:25.322
–Good.
–I'm not gonna jeopardize
the only good relationship…

33:25.362 --> 33:28.268
I've ever had because of something
I'm not and will never be again.

33:28.308 --> 33:31.938
If you wanna tell her, fine.
That's on your conscience.

33:34.801 --> 33:38.123
We found the heroin, your little sample bags.
We establish the ties…

33:38.163 --> 33:41.449
to the schools, and you're sure to get
the death penalty for that little boy.

33:41.489 --> 33:43.689
The only way to avoid it
is to give us Armadillo.

33:43.729 --> 33:46.729
He's your boss, right? Your supplier?

33:46.865 --> 33:49.167
How does he contact you?

33:56.176 --> 33:58.925
Where is he?

34:09.902 --> 34:12.391
–Yo, what's up?
–I got something for you.

34:12.431 --> 34:16.167
This pimp's getting his girls
to roll johns in an alley off Western.

34:16.206 --> 34:20.422
Okay, we'll check into it. But, tips like this
you can give over the phone.

34:20.463 --> 34:23.342
Okay. Vic.

34:23.376 --> 34:27.270
I really need to know where Brian is.
I need to see my son.

34:37.165 --> 34:39.532
Connie, you can't.

34:39.693 --> 34:44.034
I want him back, Vic.
I'm clean. I've got a job now.

34:44.205 --> 34:46.310
He's with a new family.

34:46.444 --> 34:49.574
You signed him over.

34:51.724 --> 34:53.513
I was high then.

34:53.708 --> 34:55.781
That's why you gave him up.

34:55.916 --> 35:00.235
No. No.

35:00.269 --> 35:03.239
I gave him to you
to take care of him for me.

35:05.515 --> 35:09.079
You knew I'd get clean.
You saw how hard I was trying.

35:10.090 --> 35:14.214
You don't know what this is like…
to lose your kid.

35:16.458 --> 35:18.181
Please, Vic.

35:20.810 --> 35:24.672
Brian's gone.
You have to accept that.

35:29.674 --> 35:31.364
Okay.

35:35.081 --> 35:38.790
–I'm sorry.
–I'm sorry too.

35:40.905 --> 35:45.095
Uh, that tip I just gave you?
I need a cash advance.

35:57.672 --> 35:59.679
Thanks.

36:11.719 --> 36:14.948
Navaro make any calls yet?

36:15.174 --> 36:17.475
–Nope.
–They get Duardo to roll?

36:17.637 --> 36:20.899
I don't know.
I'll be back.

36:28.261 --> 36:30.307
–Hey, Carlton.
–What's up, Vic?

36:31.589 --> 36:34.850
See this guy?
He's with the Lancaster Gang Unit.

36:35.172 --> 36:39.100
He got you a spot
on their Clean Slate program.

36:39.205 --> 36:41.823
–Is that like juvie?
–It's better.

36:41.892 --> 36:45.948
Get rid of the ink, balls'll drop,
come back in a couple years a new man.

36:45.988 --> 36:48.573
No one will even recognize you.

36:48.771 --> 36:52.027
Hey, I had to pull a lot of favors
to get this to happen.

36:52.067 --> 36:55.296
–Okay.
–Well, I'm waiting.

36:55.459 --> 36:58.754
–Thank you.
–Go.

37:02.083 --> 37:05.779
You killed your baby, didn't you, Earl?
You and Jeannie.

37:08.963 --> 37:14.441
“Baby Boy Doe buried in the unidentified
grave section of the L.A County Cemetery.”

37:17.473 --> 37:21.816
We're gonna dig him up, Earl,
get your D.N.A….

37:22.050 --> 37:25.311
Prove you were his father.

37:27.616 --> 37:31.576
You really think Armadillo's
gonna reward you for your loyalty?

37:31.616 --> 37:34.552
When we bust him,
he's gonna think it's because of you.

37:34.592 --> 37:36.472
He's got a lot of friends inside.

37:36.512 --> 37:40.064
You're gonna end up
burned to death in your cell.

37:40.097 --> 37:44.321
And we're gonna get him.
All you guys think you're so brilliant.

37:46.240 --> 37:49.818
We got you, didn't we?

37:50.015 --> 37:52.087
What happens if I tell you where he is?

37:52.127 --> 37:56.087
We'll make sure you're safe and sound
in Ossining, New York.

37:56.862 --> 38:00.228
I can only tell you
where he's been staying lately.

38:03.262 --> 38:07.062
–What's up?
–Duardo gave us Armadillo.
He's at a place in Inglewood.

38:07.102 --> 38:08.982
–Great. I'll go get my guys.
–Not necessary.

38:09.022 --> 38:10.998
–SWAT's already on their way there.
–SWAT?

38:11.038 --> 38:14.581
I'll let you see him as soon as we
bring him in. All right, let's go.

38:14.621 --> 38:16.028
Vic.

38:18.909 --> 38:23.578
–Hi. What's up?
–I was thinking that…
we could get together tonight.

38:23.773 --> 38:26.017
I can't do it tonight.
Rain check?

38:28.125 --> 38:30.132
Name the time and the place.

38:32.028 --> 38:34.516
You know,
I don't think that I can do this anymore.

38:34.556 --> 38:38.133
Sure you can.
Just another time.

38:38.395 --> 38:43.512
No, you know what? Um, this isn't working
for me the way that it used to.

38:43.611 --> 38:45.913
I gotta get out of here.

38:49.435 --> 38:53.526
You're wrong, Detective.
You don't know my mother.

38:53.754 --> 38:57.054
I just wish you had a chance
to know your brother.

39:03.866 --> 39:05.938
Should I be worried about you?

39:06.074 --> 39:07.863
Not about me.

39:08.057 --> 39:10.359
Maybe about the rest of humanity.

39:10.393 --> 39:14.419
Bunch of sociopathic
little narcissists out for ourselves.

39:14.713 --> 39:19.383
Begging, stealing,
lying, screwing, raping.

39:19.609 --> 39:22.137
Killing our babies.

39:22.170 --> 39:26.359
Whatever it takes to have a good time
and save our own asses.

39:26.712 --> 39:30.993
I can't even believe in an old woman
who's too sick to feed herself.

39:31.033 --> 39:36.051
And it's not sad. It's not some big surprise.
It's just nature.

39:36.407 --> 39:38.741
We're animals.
Nothing more.

39:38.904 --> 39:42.351
And you know what?

39:42.551 --> 39:44.795
I'm learning to be okay with that.

39:52.982 --> 39:55.790
–Navaro's on the phone?
–Less than a minute.

39:55.830 --> 40:00.846
–Prison switchboard confirms
he's talking to Armadillo.
–Give me the number.

40:01.430 --> 40:04.202
This is 323.
Aceveda's going to Inglewood.

40:04.310 --> 40:08.930
–That's 310.
–He's got the wrong address.
Go get the right one, quick.

40:08.981 --> 40:13.197
–What's he saying?
–Um, Armadillo's asking him
something in Spanish.

40:13.237 --> 40:16.498
–Something about a lawyer.
–Vic.

40:18.484 --> 40:20.780
–What?
–We can't bring him in alive.

40:20.820 --> 40:23.181
–What?
–Armadillo. We can't bring him in alive.

40:23.221 --> 40:26.924
–Why is that?
–If we take him in,
the only thing he has to deal is us.

40:26.964 --> 40:30.156
Look, I don't like it,
but this bastard has to go, Vic.

40:30.196 --> 40:33.484
Jail won't slow him down. You tried reasoning
with him. I'm not going to lose my job…

40:33.524 --> 40:37.931
so some kid-raping piece of shit can bargain
down his sentence, make me his bunk-mate.

40:37.971 --> 40:40.044
Uh-uh.

40:40.147 --> 40:42.698
–You talk to Shane about this?
–No, but I can.

40:42.738 --> 40:45.804
–3938 Bonita Vista.
–Okay, let's go.

40:45.938 --> 40:49.578
Ronnie, stay on the line.
Call us with anything we need.

40:49.618 --> 40:51.058
Lem, you drive.

40:51.092 --> 40:53.226
Hey, uh, shouldn't
we be taking two cars?

40:53.266 --> 40:54.989
–No, we're good.
–Yeah?

41:06.673 --> 41:09.577
Armadillo's
still on the phone with his bro.

41:10.993 --> 41:13.897
First guy who gets
a good shot takes it. Go.

41:57.005 --> 42:00.387
–Nothing.
–Goddamn it.

42:00.557 --> 42:02.757
–Think somebody tipped him off?
–Who?

42:02.797 --> 42:04.804
I don't know.

42:08.717 --> 42:11.172
–Yeah?
–I hope you all made it.

42:13.869 --> 42:18.407
Hey. Weren't you supposed to
meet me here to suck my dick?

42:18.827 --> 42:21.413
I wanted to speak to you
one last time.

42:21.515 --> 42:24.067
You better talk to your brother
before you start making death threats.

42:24.107 --> 42:27.588
I've already taken care of my brother.

42:30.667 --> 42:34.180
And now you've been greenlit.

09:00:00.000 --> 09:00:01.000
