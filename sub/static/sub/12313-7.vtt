00:01.683 --> 00:03.710
Hank, I want to apply to medical school.

00:03.734 --> 00:05.769
It's the admissions office
from Johns Hopkins.

00:05.803 --> 00:07.038
I'm wait-listed.

00:07.071 --> 00:08.039
Is it true?

00:08.071 --> 00:09.372
Doctor called this afternoon

00:09.406 --> 00:10.675
and if all goes well,

00:10.708 --> 00:13.276
we could be pregnant by
the end of the month.

00:13.310 --> 00:15.179
Hello, Ms. Green.

00:15.211 --> 00:17.113
I'm Dr. Sacani from HankMed.

00:17.147 --> 00:18.415
Is this you being nice,

00:18.449 --> 00:21.218
or you wanting to know
what happens in book six?

00:21.252 --> 00:23.487
Um, both.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.656
I got big news. I'm getting married!

00:25.688 --> 00:27.123
That's a little sudden, no?

00:27.156 --> 00:29.893
You know, Hank, your
father blames himself

00:29.927 --> 00:31.295
for all of your relationship problems.

00:31.328 --> 00:32.630
What do you mean?

00:32.662 --> 00:34.098
He's afraid you've become more like him

00:34.130 --> 00:36.433
and he thinks that's why you
can't seem to settle down.

00:36.466 --> 00:38.969
I had a major dishonesty relapse.

00:39.002 --> 00:40.270
But it won't happen again, right?

00:40.304 --> 00:41.471
Never.

00:41.505 --> 00:42.907
Paige and I will come to your wedding,

00:42.940 --> 00:45.509
but make no mistake,

00:45.542 --> 00:47.310
my first job as a parent

00:47.343 --> 00:50.615
will be protecting my family from you.

02:06.790 --> 02:08.893

- God.

02:08.925 --> 02:10.494
I'm trying not to be nervous.

02:10.526 --> 02:12.129
- Do I seem nervous?
- A little.

02:12.161 --> 02:13.863
Yeah, I'll try harder.

02:13.897 --> 02:16.034
Slow. Click, click.

02:17.468 --> 02:18.869
I will have you know

02:18.901 --> 02:21.105
that we were rehearsing this
dance for Newberg, not Dad.

02:21.137 --> 02:22.906
So don't think I'm forgiving him, okay?

02:22.940 --> 02:24.141
Okay.

02:24.173 --> 02:26.776
Actually, since you're flying solo,

02:26.809 --> 02:28.445
do you want to borrow
my wife to practice?

02:28.478 --> 02:30.414
- Thank you, honey...
- Oh...

02:30.446 --> 02:31.848
But I'm happy to help.

02:31.881 --> 02:34.584
Ms. Newberg expects you out on
the dance floor too, you know.

02:34.618 --> 02:36.387
Yeah, thank you, but maybe another time.

02:36.420 --> 02:37.887
Sure.

02:37.921 --> 02:40.291
Um, oh, if it's okay,
I'd like your plus one.

02:40.323 --> 02:41.926
The wedding's become a hot
ticket all of a sudden

02:41.958 --> 02:43.526
and the administrator over
at Riverhead Hospital

02:43.559 --> 02:44.527
really wants to go.

02:44.560 --> 02:45.563
Yeah, it's not okay.

02:45.595 --> 02:47.230
Okay, babe, we got a lot of work to do.

02:47.263 --> 02:49.933
Okay. Excuse me.

02:49.966 --> 02:52.069
I take it the staff
meeting isn't happening.

02:52.101 --> 02:54.637
Uh, no, and do you mind being
on call for a few hours?

02:54.671 --> 02:56.307
We've got an important
wedding commitment

02:56.339 --> 02:57.307
and we don't wanna be late for it.

02:57.340 --> 02:58.808
Okay, just five more minutes.

03:05.149 --> 03:06.317
Oh, my God.

03:06.350 --> 03:07.317
I can't believe we're about to meet

03:07.351 --> 03:08.752
<i>the</i> Annette Bellamy.

03:08.786 --> 03:10.821
I grew up watching her movies, okay?

03:10.853 --> 03:13.224
And my parents took me to see
her on Broadway three times.

03:13.256 --> 03:15.291
Can you try to stand
as still as possible?

03:15.325 --> 03:16.393
Oh, my bad.

03:16.427 --> 03:18.796
Maybe, Paige, you should
gush a little less

03:18.828 --> 03:21.332
when she gets here,
for both their sakes.

03:21.364 --> 03:23.868
Oh, that's all right.
Annette is used to it.

03:23.900 --> 03:26.002
That's what you get when
you're a living legend.

03:29.373 --> 03:34.111
- What a dump.
- Darling!

03:37.013 --> 03:39.149
Annette, this is Divya.

03:39.183 --> 03:41.986
And Paige, the peppy
girl married to Evan

03:42.018 --> 03:44.522
and the PA, you told me.

03:44.554 --> 03:46.756
Oh, my God. I just, like...

03:46.790 --> 03:48.559
Oh, my God, it's...

03:48.591 --> 03:49.726
it's like you.

03:49.760 --> 03:50.960
It's like you. It's like you right here.

03:50.994 --> 03:52.229
Like...

03:52.262 --> 03:53.764
I've watched you in every
movie you have ever made.

03:53.797 --> 03:56.867
I used to pretend that I was
you in "Hold Me Closer."

03:56.899 --> 03:59.269
Why'd you stop?

03:59.303 --> 04:01.338
Uh...

04:01.370 --> 04:02.505
Sh... Uh...

04:02.539 --> 04:04.674
Relax. I'm messing with you.

04:04.708 --> 04:05.676
Oh.

04:05.708 --> 04:06.709
But I'll tell you one thing,

04:06.743 --> 04:09.313
it was this woman...

04:09.345 --> 04:12.215
she's the one who has the real talent.

04:12.249 --> 04:14.984
If she hadn't made a career
out of getting married,

04:15.018 --> 04:17.688
she could have been a
bigger star than I am.

04:17.721 --> 04:20.357
Oh, Ms. Newberg, you acted?

04:20.389 --> 04:22.625
- I dabbled.
- Ha.

04:22.659 --> 04:25.396
She had presence. She had poise.

04:25.428 --> 04:26.964
She had balls.

04:26.997 --> 04:28.799
How's the new show?

04:28.832 --> 04:31.101
Time of my life.

04:31.134 --> 04:35.706
Cumberbatch gets a little
handsy now and then.

04:35.738 --> 04:37.140
Annette just flew in from London

04:37.173 --> 04:38.909
where she's working on
a new musical version

04:38.942 --> 04:40.244
of "Uncle Vanya."

04:40.276 --> 04:41.411
Oh.

04:41.445 --> 04:45.149
I am so happy you are here.

04:45.181 --> 04:46.616
I couldn't do this without you.

04:46.649 --> 04:48.486
Clearly.

04:48.519 --> 04:50.554
I've been to all five of her weddings.

04:50.587 --> 04:52.589
Well, this is my last one.

04:52.623 --> 04:55.192
Eddie is the only man I ever loved...

04:55.224 --> 04:56.526
for more than a year.

04:56.560 --> 04:59.363
Wait till you see me in my new dress.

04:59.396 --> 05:01.866
Oh, I sizzle.

05:01.899 --> 05:04.635
I think this is my
Schmoopy's way of telling me

05:04.668 --> 05:06.036
to lay off the Oreos.

05:06.068 --> 05:07.203
Maybe.

05:07.236 --> 05:09.939
Hey, Evan, could you give
your dad a hand here?

05:09.973 --> 05:11.242
I think you can handle it.

05:11.274 --> 05:12.442
No, no, no, I... I...

05:12.476 --> 05:14.043
you know what it... it's the wrong size.

05:14.077 --> 05:15.411
I can't figure this out.

05:15.445 --> 05:17.348
Uh, Dad, cumberbunds are adjustable.

05:17.380 --> 05:20.049
Yeah. Hank, would you do me a favor?

05:20.082 --> 05:22.986
Go and see what Ms. Newberg says.

05:23.019 --> 05:25.022
You know, I-I would like to,

05:25.055 --> 05:27.224
but I can't see her in her
dress before the wedding.

05:27.257 --> 05:28.358
Really?

05:28.392 --> 05:30.627
Well, cumberbunds are
so important to her.

05:30.661 --> 05:32.663
Oh, yeah. Okay.

05:37.567 --> 05:38.769
I'm gonna go with him.

05:42.438 --> 05:44.407
- Divya.
- Yes?

05:44.440 --> 05:46.543
I hear you're going to medical school.

05:46.577 --> 05:47.877
Uh, yes.

05:47.911 --> 05:49.446
I just don't know where yet.

05:49.478 --> 05:52.649
And Paige, you're trying
to get knocked up?

05:52.683 --> 05:55.052
Wow.

05:55.084 --> 05:56.954
Ms. Newberg really did fill you in.

09:12.226 --> 09:14.797
Your father's told me so much about you,

09:14.830 --> 09:17.333
Evan, and your sister, Emma.

09:17.365 --> 09:18.833
Didn't see that one coming.

09:19.967 --> 09:22.537
But, you, concierge doctor to the stars?

09:22.571 --> 09:24.273
That's not exactly...

09:24.306 --> 09:25.840
You know what, he's just being modest.

09:25.874 --> 09:26.841
It's like a sickness.

09:26.874 --> 09:27.909
Speaking of which,

09:27.942 --> 09:30.178
I think that Annette
needs one of your exams.

09:30.211 --> 09:33.215
I do not need an exam.

09:33.248 --> 09:34.682
Ms. Newberg and I are very worried

09:34.715 --> 09:37.152
what with all of the events
coming up for the wedding.

09:37.185 --> 09:39.488
So, Annette, what's going on?

09:39.520 --> 09:41.389
Ask Mr. Doctor over there.

09:41.422 --> 09:43.859
She has trouble hearing,
she has trouble sleeping,

09:43.892 --> 09:45.060
and she's weak.

09:45.092 --> 09:48.129
- Am I right?
- Welcome to life in your 60s.

09:48.162 --> 09:50.099
Uh-huh.

09:50.132 --> 09:53.068
70s?

09:53.100 --> 09:55.837
Anyway, how about you
let me draw some blood,

09:55.870 --> 09:57.706
get some more of your
history, and do a CT?

09:57.739 --> 09:59.807
Just to make sure Mr.
Doctor here isn't right.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.744
Fine.

10:01.777 --> 10:05.913
But these symptoms are probably
just from my hearing aids.

10:05.946 --> 10:07.715
I think the batteries died.

10:07.749 --> 10:09.984
Easy peasy. He can fix them.

10:10.018 --> 10:12.254
Uh, Dad, you don't fix
batteries, you replace them.

10:12.287 --> 10:13.922
But if anybody can do it, you can do it.

10:13.955 --> 10:17.626
He takes household items
and makes medical devices.

10:17.658 --> 10:19.427
I'm not kidding. He's
like that guy on TV.

10:19.460 --> 10:21.062
What is that guy's name?
What is the guy's name?

10:21.095 --> 10:22.597
Mr. Fix It?

10:22.630 --> 10:24.298
Mr. Fix It. You're Mr. Fix it.

10:24.331 --> 10:26.402
Okay. I'm Mr. Fix it.

10:32.541 --> 10:35.010
You're amazing.

10:35.042 --> 10:36.010
These should be in a museum,

10:36.043 --> 10:38.880
not dragged over dirt and asphalt.

10:38.913 --> 10:41.850
I want the newlyweds to
drive away in style.

10:41.883 --> 10:42.917
Thank you for helping.

10:42.951 --> 10:45.053
I know you're not doing it for him.

10:51.826 --> 10:54.696
I can't wait. I'm too excited.

10:54.730 --> 10:55.964
What's wrong with a heads-up?

10:55.997 --> 10:58.233
- The blood test is tomorrow.
- I know. So what?

10:58.265 --> 10:59.267
If we're gonna be pregnant tomorrow,

10:59.301 --> 11:01.903
we're already pregnant today, so...

11:01.936 --> 11:03.538
It's like peeking at the end
of a book before you read it.

11:03.571 --> 11:05.673
- Everyone does it.
- I don't.

11:05.706 --> 11:07.975
Then how do you know
what's gonna happen?

11:08.009 --> 11:09.143
Please?

11:09.177 --> 11:12.181
All right. We'll wait.

11:19.955 --> 11:21.724
Thanks for teaching me to dance.

11:21.757 --> 11:23.392
- Straight line?
- Uh-huh.

11:23.425 --> 11:26.061
- Straight line.
- All right.

11:26.094 --> 11:30.199
Rectangle and triangle.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.199
You're good at this.

11:31.233 --> 11:33.135
- You must practice.
- Uh-huh.

11:33.167 --> 11:35.604
Do you, uh, have a partner
you go out and dance with?

11:35.637 --> 11:37.272
No.

11:37.305 --> 11:38.340
It's like riding a bike,

11:38.373 --> 11:40.342
just to music and with no pedaling.

11:40.374 --> 11:42.277
Ah.

11:42.310 --> 11:44.613
I only ask because I saw that
woman at the lab yesterday.

11:44.645 --> 11:46.147
She seemed excited to see you.

11:46.181 --> 11:47.249
- I thought...
- Rectangle.

11:47.282 --> 11:49.718
Mm-hmm.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.385
Okay, I know her name is C.G.

11:51.418 --> 11:52.821
and that she's a HankMed patient.

11:52.854 --> 11:54.889
Cindy, really, was a HankMed patient.

11:54.922 --> 11:57.525
We're... we're doing research together.

11:57.558 --> 11:58.893
Ah.

12:01.997 --> 12:03.899
But I-I like her.

12:03.932 --> 12:05.533
I'm so happy for you.

12:05.566 --> 12:08.336
She's very... very smart,

12:08.369 --> 12:10.873
uh, and talented and accomplished.

12:10.906 --> 12:12.274
I hope she likes me.

12:12.307 --> 12:14.109
Well, you're all those
things too, Jeremiah,

12:14.142 --> 12:16.345
and I'm sure she will.

12:16.378 --> 12:18.213
You're quite the catch, you know...

12:18.245 --> 12:20.515
single, smart, doctor.

12:20.548 --> 12:22.683
Just like you.

12:22.716 --> 12:24.619
Straight line.

12:25.854 --> 12:27.656
You bringing her to the wedding?

12:27.688 --> 12:29.690
Uh, Cindy doesn't really like crowds,

12:29.724 --> 12:31.460
and anyway, I don't have a plus one.

12:31.493 --> 12:33.128
Look at you.

12:33.161 --> 12:35.297
It's all coming clear now.

12:35.330 --> 12:36.999
What? No, no. It's not...

12:37.032 --> 12:38.133
Hi, Jeremiah.

12:38.166 --> 12:40.469
Or should I say the future Mr.
Henry Lawson?

12:40.502 --> 12:42.037
- Dad.
- Hi, Eddie.

12:42.070 --> 12:45.840
- Good effort.
- Thanks.

12:45.874 --> 12:47.909
- I've got great news.
- What?

12:47.942 --> 12:50.545
It's not Mr. Fix it. It's MacGyver.

12:50.579 --> 12:52.414
Please tell me you didn't
drive here to tell me that.

12:52.446 --> 12:53.682
I didn't drive here to tell you that.

12:53.715 --> 12:55.450
- Good.
- It's about your brother Evan.

12:55.483 --> 12:57.753
Look, I don't want his
anger to affect his toast

12:57.786 --> 12:58.987
at the rehearsal dinner.

12:59.019 --> 13:01.122
No matter how he feels about me,

13:01.156 --> 13:04.059
his anger should not
affect my bride-to-be.

13:04.091 --> 13:06.494
It's her sixth wedding.
It should be perfect.

13:06.528 --> 13:07.796
All right, don't worry. Okay?

13:07.829 --> 13:09.263
I will make sure Evan behaves.

13:09.297 --> 13:10.666
How?

13:10.699 --> 13:11.667
I don't know.

13:11.700 --> 13:13.701
I'll MacGyver it.

13:13.734 --> 13:15.970
You smarty-pants.

13:34.388 --> 13:36.457
Look, it's part of our responsibilities

13:36.490 --> 13:38.893
and the honor of being Best Men.

13:38.927 --> 13:40.995
Oh, my God, responsibility and honor.

13:41.028 --> 13:43.264
The fact that you're even using
those two words in a sentence

13:43.297 --> 13:44.799
about Dad is hilarious.

13:44.832 --> 13:46.267
It's ridiculous! Come on.

13:46.301 --> 13:47.603
He deserted us.

13:47.635 --> 13:50.338
He stole money from HankMed.
He sold Boris out.

13:50.372 --> 13:53.041
Like, why would I want a
person like that in my life?

13:53.074 --> 13:54.509
Because people change.

13:54.542 --> 13:55.944
Dad's changed.

13:55.976 --> 13:57.812
Look, he's starting a new life,

13:57.845 --> 13:58.946
he's gonna need our support.

13:58.980 --> 13:59.947
Yeah, well...

13:59.980 --> 14:01.148
I get it, you're upset.

14:01.182 --> 14:02.316
Yeah, I don't think you do.

14:02.350 --> 14:04.485
Look, I'm going. I will
go to the wedding.

14:04.518 --> 14:06.355
I will dance at the wedding,

14:06.388 --> 14:07.989
but I will not give a toast tonight.

Evan.

16:18.052 --> 16:19.754
Fine, I'll do it.

16:21.789 --> 16:23.090
Sorry for interrupting.

16:23.124 --> 16:25.694
No, no, no, not at all.
Is everything okay?

16:25.726 --> 16:27.194
- You can...
- Oh, yeah.

16:27.228 --> 16:29.931
Nice to see you again.

16:29.964 --> 16:32.801
I don't make a habit of
breaking and entering,

16:32.834 --> 16:36.805
though I did play a cat
burglar for Hitch once.

16:36.837 --> 16:39.240
It was a second-story job,

16:39.273 --> 16:43.644
and the diamonds were concealed
in a cut crystal decanter

16:43.677 --> 16:46.447
of the finest Canadian whiskey.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.115
Huh.

16:48.148 --> 16:51.519
Annette, is something wrong?

16:51.552 --> 16:53.554
Hmm?

16:53.587 --> 16:55.656
Oh, right. Oh.

16:55.690 --> 16:57.993
Those symptoms your father said I had,

16:58.026 --> 16:59.995
he's smarter than he looks.

17:00.028 --> 17:00.995
Hmm.

17:01.028 --> 17:02.463
Why didn't you tell me before?

17:02.497 --> 17:04.132
It's none of your business.

17:04.164 --> 17:05.465
Okay.

17:05.499 --> 17:08.737
And because I don't want it to be true.

17:08.769 --> 17:10.204
My memory's all funny.

17:10.238 --> 17:15.810
I can't remember how to get
to the theater sometimes.

17:15.844 --> 17:17.045
Can't even remember the cocktails
that I had last night.

17:17.077 --> 17:19.314
It's Alzheimer's,

17:19.346 --> 17:22.782
an ugly name for an ugly disease.

17:22.816 --> 17:25.752
Look, memory loss can be a
symptom of a lot of things,

17:25.787 --> 17:28.522
like lack of sleep, too many cocktails,

17:28.556 --> 17:30.659
or even old age.

17:30.691 --> 17:34.462
Not that you're old or drink too much.

17:34.496 --> 17:35.864
How's your sleep?

17:35.896 --> 17:37.331
I've never been a good sleeper...

17:37.364 --> 17:40.134
- too much to do, until now.
- Mm.

17:40.168 --> 17:42.037
I'll have to quit the show,

17:42.069 --> 17:44.605
quit the business.

17:44.639 --> 17:48.543
It's been my life since I was 19.

17:48.576 --> 17:49.778
Mm.

17:49.810 --> 17:51.712
Have you had trouble remembering
things from your past?

17:51.746 --> 17:53.648
Just new things,

17:53.681 --> 17:55.450
like my lines for the play.

17:55.482 --> 17:58.286
I just stand there like a half-wit.

17:58.318 --> 18:00.055
It's called anterograde memory loss,

18:00.087 --> 18:03.624
and while, yes, that might
be a symptom of Alzheimer's,

18:03.657 --> 18:04.892
you might be suffering from something

18:04.925 --> 18:06.694
that's completely reversible,

18:06.728 --> 18:09.831
like encephalopathy or dehydration.

18:09.864 --> 18:12.334
So let's wait till the
test results come back

18:12.366 --> 18:13.902
before we worry too much.

18:13.934 --> 18:16.037
It's gonna be okay.

18:20.674 --> 18:23.177
Hey, Rembrandt.

18:23.210 --> 18:25.180
Wow, what's that for?

18:25.212 --> 18:26.514
It's for your wedding.

18:26.547 --> 18:28.849
It's for guests to write
their wishes to your guys,

18:28.883 --> 18:30.719
so you'll always know how
many people love you.

18:30.751 --> 18:32.052
What a great thought.

18:32.085 --> 18:33.454
It looks just like the photograph.

18:33.488 --> 18:36.024
Thanks.

18:36.057 --> 18:37.025
Okay, what's wrong?

18:37.057 --> 18:38.192
What do you mean?

18:38.226 --> 18:39.861
It's Eddie. Spill.

18:39.893 --> 18:41.662
I'm fine.

18:41.695 --> 18:43.330
I really don't know what
you're talking about.

18:43.364 --> 18:44.432
- You don't?
- No.

18:44.464 --> 18:46.801
Would you step inside my office, please?

18:50.371 --> 18:51.540
Come here.

18:57.545 --> 18:59.848
All right, what gives?

19:02.849 --> 19:04.718
I'm not pregnant.

19:04.751 --> 19:06.187
Sweetie.

19:06.220 --> 19:09.124
And I'm afraid I never will be.

19:09.156 --> 19:11.025
I just...

19:11.058 --> 19:12.893
don't understand why something
that's supposed to be

19:12.926 --> 19:15.129
so simple has to be so hard.

19:15.162 --> 19:18.967
Okay, listen, I am the perfect example

19:18.999 --> 19:22.703
of how simple gets complicated.

19:22.737 --> 19:24.573
You don't give up.

19:24.605 --> 19:26.907
Now I know why Evan is so upset.

19:26.941 --> 19:28.210
Oh, no, he doesn't know.

19:28.242 --> 19:30.644
Just the thought of telling him...

19:30.678 --> 19:31.880
he's gonna just be...

19:31.912 --> 19:34.348
I know, I know, I know, I know.

19:34.382 --> 19:35.984
I know very few things.

19:36.017 --> 19:37.719
This I know for sure,

19:37.751 --> 19:42.323
one day, you are going
to be a fantastic mom.

19:42.356 --> 19:44.291
Do you believe me?

19:44.325 --> 19:47.729
Do you believe me? Come here.

19:47.761 --> 19:50.264
I promise.

19:52.467 --> 19:55.604
Wow, are you a good painter.

19:55.636 --> 19:57.806
Could you make my teeth smaller?

20:03.918 --> 20:05.720
Hi.

20:05.754 --> 20:07.689
Hi.

20:07.930 --> 20:09.398
Oh, my God.

20:09.431 --> 20:12.468
We're one blood test away
from being pregnant.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.302
You ready for the news?

20:14.336 --> 20:16.505
I know the news.

20:16.538 --> 20:18.574
We're not.

20:18.606 --> 20:20.209
I, uh,

20:20.241 --> 20:22.644
cheated and took one of the tests.

20:22.677 --> 20:25.213
I peeked at the end.

20:27.982 --> 20:29.984
How are you not a giant
puddle of tears right now?

20:30.018 --> 20:31.787
Oh, I was,

20:31.819 --> 20:35.456
and if it weren't for
Eddie, I still would be.

20:35.490 --> 20:37.092
Eddie who?

20:37.125 --> 20:39.461
Eddie your father.

20:39.493 --> 20:41.863
I, um, did my best to hide it,

20:41.896 --> 20:43.331
you know, to keep it inside,

20:43.365 --> 20:46.234
but he took one look at me and he knew.

20:46.268 --> 20:48.837
Yeah, well, he's always been
very good at reading people.

20:48.869 --> 20:50.271
It's what makes him a good con man.

20:50.305 --> 20:53.108
He wasn't conning me. He was helping me.

20:53.141 --> 20:55.311
Yeah, so you would tell
me and I'd forgive him.

20:55.344 --> 20:57.011
That's what he does. He's
always working an angle.

20:57.045 --> 20:58.681
You cannot trust my father, Paige.

20:58.713 --> 21:01.082
Okay.

21:01.115 --> 21:03.251
You have so much anger towards him,

21:03.285 --> 21:05.154
and I get it,

21:05.186 --> 21:07.956
but you have to figure
out how to let that go

21:07.990 --> 21:11.859
because I want a family...
a happy family...

21:11.893 --> 21:13.929
and that can't happen with you carrying

21:13.962 --> 21:16.198
your anger around all the time.

21:18.066 --> 21:19.268
Look,

21:19.300 --> 21:22.837
I was ready to just give
up on IVF completely,

21:22.871 --> 21:25.841
but after one pep talk with Eddie,

21:25.874 --> 21:28.344
I want to sign up for
another round or two

21:28.376 --> 21:29.544
or ten.

21:29.577 --> 21:31.814
Whatever it takes.

21:51.333 --> 21:53.302
I'm gonna sit down.

21:57.606 --> 21:58.673
Hello.

21:58.706 --> 22:01.075
- Rosé?
- Yeah, sure.

22:01.108 --> 22:02.778
Would your guest like rosé?

22:02.810 --> 22:05.947
Uh, actually, you can
clear that setting.

22:05.981 --> 22:08.116
My date couldn't make it
to the rehearsal dinner.

22:08.150 --> 22:10.786
- Oh.
- Traffic.

22:10.818 --> 22:13.122
I don't have a date.

22:24.633 --> 22:28.069
You look like a guy who could
use a drink, and I'm buying.

22:28.103 --> 22:30.105
I think it's an open bar.

22:30.137 --> 22:31.606
Then I've got the next round too.

22:31.640 --> 22:32.975
What's the matter?

22:33.008 --> 22:35.678
No fun being stag at a wedding?

22:35.711 --> 22:37.613
Think everyone's looking at you?

22:37.645 --> 22:39.714
Wondering "What's wrong
with that loser?"

22:39.748 --> 22:42.217
Actually, I wasn't, but now I am.

22:42.250 --> 22:44.819
Please, I've been to
enough weddings on my own

22:44.853 --> 22:46.188
to know what you're feeling,

22:46.221 --> 22:48.390
and those are just Newberg's weddings.

22:50.192 --> 22:51.859
It would be nice to go to a wedding once

22:51.893 --> 22:53.629
with someone I love,

22:53.662 --> 22:55.497
but that's not what's bothering me.

22:55.529 --> 22:58.399
I've got some bad news.

22:58.433 --> 23:02.871
The test ruled out other
causes for your symptoms.

23:02.904 --> 23:04.873
I have Alzheimer's?

23:04.905 --> 23:07.442
It's more likely, but
it's not a certainty.

23:07.475 --> 23:08.843
Now, I found a neurologist in London

23:08.876 --> 23:11.180
who comes highly recommended.

23:11.212 --> 23:12.714
I'm so sorry I can't help you more.

23:12.748 --> 23:16.785
Hey, you don't get to be more
upset about this than I do.

23:16.817 --> 23:18.487
No one likes a scene-stealer.

23:18.519 --> 23:19.887
Oh.

23:19.921 --> 23:21.190
Well, let's cheer you up.

23:21.222 --> 23:23.658
I've seen a lot of
attractive women here.

23:23.692 --> 23:25.760
So what's your thing, boobs?

23:25.794 --> 23:27.563

27:57.331 --> 27:59.233
Annette.

28:00.234 --> 28:02.036
Annette.

28:02.069 --> 28:03.337
Annette. Annette. Easy, easy.

28:03.371 --> 28:06.541
You're having a seizure.

28:06.574 --> 28:08.143
Okay. Okay.

28:20.154 --> 28:21.717
You're missing the wedding.

28:21.842 --> 28:23.043
It doesn't start for an hour

28:23.077 --> 28:25.046
and I wanted to see you first.

28:25.079 --> 28:28.550
What a gentleman. I'm honored.

28:28.582 --> 28:31.919
So your EEG demonstrated slow waves

28:31.953 --> 28:34.122
in the right posterior
temporal zone of your brain,

28:34.155 --> 28:37.292
affecting the occipital
and temporal lobes.

28:37.324 --> 28:41.095
Have you noticed any auditory
or visual changes recently?

28:41.128 --> 28:43.397
I've been seeing numbers.

28:43.430 --> 28:46.333
Uh, digits, complex numbers?

28:46.367 --> 28:49.370
Who do I look like, Stephen Hawking?

28:49.404 --> 28:52.607
Numbers, like the ones
from movies and shows

28:52.639 --> 28:54.042
I've been in.

28:54.074 --> 28:55.843
Singing and dancing, some of which,

28:55.877 --> 28:59.347
I have to say, could use
a little more rehearsal.

28:59.379 --> 29:01.917
Wait, so you've been
having hallucinations?

29:01.949 --> 29:05.119
Like a beautiful waltz down memory lane.

29:05.153 --> 29:07.689
I wish you'd told me sooner.
They're a symptom.

29:07.722 --> 29:10.292
That my memories, along with my career,

29:10.324 --> 29:11.926
are ending?

29:11.959 --> 29:15.029
Hallucinations are not a
symptom of Alzheimer's.

29:15.062 --> 29:17.732
- They're not?
- Neither are seizures.

29:17.764 --> 29:20.267
I think you have a form of epilepsy.

29:20.301 --> 29:21.703
I'm gonna give you some medication

29:21.735 --> 29:23.138
and I'd like to forward your records

29:23.170 --> 29:24.538
to the neurologist in London.

29:24.571 --> 29:26.974
Forward away.

29:27.007 --> 29:28.843
Can I get a doctor's note

29:28.877 --> 29:31.279
to attend a wedding?

29:31.311 --> 29:34.482
I've never missed one
of Toots' nuptials.

29:34.514 --> 29:37.651
Uh, I'm sorry, did you say, "Toots"?

29:37.685 --> 29:39.788
Let's keep that between you and me.

29:39.820 --> 29:41.022
Done and done.

29:41.054 --> 29:42.289
First, let's get you an MRI,

29:42.322 --> 29:43.724
make sure there are no other issues,

29:43.757 --> 29:45.559
but while we await the results,

29:45.592 --> 29:47.595
I see no reason why the maid of honor

29:47.628 --> 29:50.432
can't attend the wedding of Ms.
Toots Newberg.

30:02.176 --> 30:04.178
Hank's not here yet, huh?

30:07.581 --> 30:09.318
He's on his way.

30:21.061 --> 30:23.764
I prepared a speech for you,

30:23.798 --> 30:25.634
basically because Hank

30:25.667 --> 30:28.703
forced me to.

30:28.735 --> 30:30.437
I was gonna do it at
the rehearsal dinner,

30:30.471 --> 30:32.240
but, uh,

30:32.272 --> 30:33.808
then it got interrupted,

30:33.840 --> 30:35.644
so...

30:42.951 --> 30:45.353
Would you like to hear it now?

30:45.386 --> 30:48.290
I think I'm gonna need that drink first.

30:51.024 --> 30:52.360
Thank you.

30:56.965 --> 30:59.301
To my dad,

30:59.333 --> 31:01.135
Eddie R. Lawson,

31:01.168 --> 31:03.671
the man who made me who I am,

31:03.705 --> 31:05.907
good and bad.

31:05.939 --> 31:08.342
The same hustle,

31:08.376 --> 31:11.012
the attraction to shortcuts,

31:11.044 --> 31:15.215
the eye for a way in and up,

31:15.249 --> 31:16.718
but also the luck of finding people

31:16.751 --> 31:20.589
who love us for who we are
and make us better men.

31:24.993 --> 31:29.063
It breaks my heart when you
don't live up to the good, Dad,

31:29.097 --> 31:33.301
'cause if you can't live
up to it, how can I?

31:33.333 --> 31:36.304
And you have so much good in you.

31:38.906 --> 31:41.209
For me,

31:41.242 --> 31:43.011
purely because of my wife

31:43.043 --> 31:44.778
and my marriage,

31:44.811 --> 31:47.815
I have more confidence
in being my better self,

31:47.849 --> 31:50.185
being the guy with integrity

31:50.217 --> 31:53.287
who listens and learns

31:53.320 --> 31:55.889
and is happy.

31:55.923 --> 31:57.759
So...

31:57.792 --> 32:01.228
it's my hope that your marriage
brings you the same, Dad.

32:03.363 --> 32:06.167
I love you. Mazel tov.

32:06.199 --> 32:08.202
I love you.

32:11.505 --> 32:13.207
Mazel tov.

32:16.444 --> 32:21.349
I could not have asked for
a better wedding present.

32:21.381 --> 32:22.883
Dad, you know you pushed it too far

32:22.917 --> 32:24.019
when even with your health scare

32:24.051 --> 32:25.419
Evan wouldn't come around.

32:25.453 --> 32:28.089
The health scare made
it worse, actually.

32:28.121 --> 32:29.724
What if we lost you

32:29.756 --> 32:30.758
without even saying good-bye?

32:30.792 --> 32:33.261
Like, I can't do that again.

32:33.293 --> 32:34.595
Again?

32:34.628 --> 32:35.964
You were there for your mom.

32:35.996 --> 32:37.564
No, I wasn't. Not at the end.

32:37.598 --> 32:39.200
Sure you were.

32:39.233 --> 32:41.136
No, I wasn't.

32:41.168 --> 32:43.037
That last night at the
hospital, you went alone.

32:43.070 --> 32:44.672
You said you didn't want
me to see her like that.

32:44.705 --> 32:48.309
Remember?

32:48.341 --> 32:51.311
Evan, I'm so sorry.

32:51.345 --> 32:52.647
I thought I was protecting you.

32:52.679 --> 32:55.149
I know. It's okay.

32:55.183 --> 32:56.651
I'm the one who should be sorry.

32:56.684 --> 32:59.287
I made you do...

32:59.320 --> 33:00.487
an adult's job.

33:00.521 --> 33:03.224
You were such a little boy.

33:03.256 --> 33:04.426
Come here.

33:11.532 --> 33:14.769
All right, here's my promise:

33:14.801 --> 33:18.772
I will never take my sons'

33:18.805 --> 33:21.875
love for granted.

33:21.908 --> 33:24.278
Hmm.

33:28.337 --> 33:30.312
Marriage is a promise

33:30.337 --> 33:33.140
between two people who love each other,

33:33.376 --> 33:34.778
who trust that love,

33:34.953 --> 33:37.655
who honor one another as individuals

33:37.680 --> 33:39.749
in that togetherness,

33:39.781 --> 33:44.619
and who wish to spend the
rest of their lives together.

33:44.653 --> 33:47.924
Will you have this man
to be your husband,

33:47.956 --> 33:51.560
to live together in the
covenant of marriage?

33:52.728 --> 33:54.564
Mazel tov!

34:01.803 --> 34:03.605
You know, this is all
because of you, Hank.

34:03.638 --> 34:06.475
If you hadn't fixed my
flat tire way back then,

34:06.508 --> 34:08.743
I never would have met my sweet Eddie.

34:08.775 --> 34:11.914
Well, it was and is my pleasure.

34:11.946 --> 34:13.915
You were Newparts Newberg back then.

34:13.947 --> 34:15.550
And you were a citiot,

34:15.583 --> 34:17.620
but not anymore.

34:17.652 --> 34:20.022
Nice castle for a wedding.

34:20.054 --> 34:22.225
Do I get to meet the infamous owner?

34:22.257 --> 34:25.025
Uh, Boris and Marissa said
they were coming, but...

34:25.060 --> 34:27.597
Well, they sent a gift,
a very heavy gift.

34:27.629 --> 34:28.731
Like a brick.

34:28.763 --> 34:31.166
We haven't opened it yet.

34:31.199 --> 34:35.538
Brick heavy or gold bar heavy?

34:35.571 --> 34:37.206
I will be right back.

34:40.507 --> 34:45.146
I know it hasn't been easy
right now for you and Paige,

34:45.179 --> 34:47.549
but you've been a good
husband to my daughter

34:47.581 --> 34:50.085
and I just wanted to thank you.

34:50.118 --> 34:52.987
I underestimated you.

34:53.022 --> 34:55.224
Thank you, General Collins.

34:55.255 --> 34:57.726
And I know you'll be a good father

34:57.760 --> 35:00.897
to our grandchild,

35:00.930 --> 35:02.298
whenever that happens.

35:02.330 --> 35:04.499
That means a lot,

35:04.533 --> 35:07.703
especially coming from you, sir.

35:07.736 --> 35:08.838
Maybe it's time I call
you by your first name.

35:08.870 --> 35:10.238
What do you think?

35:10.272 --> 35:14.110
I don't think so, son.

35:14.142 --> 35:15.810
Kind of like our wedding.

35:15.843 --> 35:16.811
Yeah.

35:16.845 --> 35:18.981
Minus a couple of hundred guests,

35:19.013 --> 35:20.448
90% of the budget, and the castle,

35:20.481 --> 35:22.150
it's just like it.

35:22.184 --> 35:24.754
And I wouldn't have changed a thing.

35:24.787 --> 35:26.289
Me neither.

35:29.290 --> 35:32.562
I'll go get us some drinks.

35:45.374 --> 35:47.577
- Are you having fun?
- I am.

35:47.609 --> 35:51.012
Thank you for bringing me.
It's a beautiful wedding.

35:51.046 --> 35:53.515
Well, it's no Garden of Zall.

35:55.249 --> 35:57.786
It's gorgeous, and...

35:57.819 --> 35:59.321
it's very romantic.

36:12.234 --> 36:14.703
May I have everyone's attention?

36:14.736 --> 36:18.173
My spouse, my groom, my lover,

36:18.207 --> 36:19.809
it's time for us to dance,

36:19.841 --> 36:22.544
but first, I want to introduce you all

36:22.577 --> 36:24.713
to a very dear friend of mine,

36:24.747 --> 36:27.850
world-famous violinist, Mr. Joshua Bell.

36:27.883 --> 36:29.785
Thank you, Ms. Newberg, it's...

36:29.818 --> 36:31.754
it's always great to play
at one of your weddings.

36:31.787 --> 36:33.388
Congratulations to you both.

36:33.421 --> 36:35.724
Thank you.

36:35.758 --> 36:36.993

on the dance floor.

40:10.872 --> 40:13.341
Annette? Annette, are you okay?

40:13.374 --> 40:15.109
I'm having a headache,

40:15.142 --> 40:17.345
and it hurts like a...

40:17.379 --> 40:19.682
Okay, okay, I'm getting
you back to the hospital.

40:19.714 --> 40:21.883
I'm worried you may have a brain bleed.

40:21.917 --> 40:23.385
What about the cake?

40:23.417 --> 40:25.720
I'll make sure they save you a piece.

40:25.754 --> 40:27.857
Annette. Annette.

40:27.890 --> 40:30.225
Okay, I got you. I got you.

40:32.817 --> 40:34.252
So, Annette,

40:34.285 --> 40:36.729
the MRI results showed a
cavernous malformation

40:36.754 --> 40:38.089
that the CT missed.

40:38.114 --> 40:40.417
It's a cluster of abnormally
formed blood vessels

40:40.449 --> 40:41.583
bleeding in your brain.

40:41.616 --> 40:44.219
Is that why I've been
having hallucinations?

40:44.252 --> 40:46.323
Yes, and you developed epilepsy

40:46.355 --> 40:48.123
caused by the presence
of the malformation,

40:48.156 --> 40:51.527
but the surgery will evacuate
the bleeding and remove it.

40:51.560 --> 40:55.531
I'm sorry to say, you will lose
your musical hallucinations,

40:55.565 --> 40:57.500
but the good news is

40:57.533 --> 41:00.636
you should full recover
and can continue doing

41:00.670 --> 41:02.639
what you love for years to come.

but I have a surgery to attend,

42:08.203 --> 42:11.073
and you have that party to get back to.

42:11.107 --> 42:14.377
I think it's time for you
to find your plus one.

42:14.410 --> 42:17.246
Yeah, I'm not sure that it is.

42:17.279 --> 42:19.482
What if I don't need to meet someone?

42:19.515 --> 42:22.986
What if I end up alone
and what if that's okay?

42:23.018 --> 42:25.020
It's been more than okay for me.

42:25.053 --> 42:26.889
And from what I've seen,

42:26.922 --> 42:29.725
you have a whole
community who loves you.

42:29.759 --> 42:32.328
You'll never be alone.

42:32.361 --> 42:34.029
You know, I've been thinking
there's something wrong with me

42:34.062 --> 42:35.064
that I can't find someone,

42:35.096 --> 42:36.999
but maybe there isn't.

42:37.033 --> 42:38.535
I'm having a great life.

42:38.567 --> 42:41.203
Time to dream up your next adventure.

42:45.007 --> 42:47.177
Okay.

42:47.210 --> 42:48.244
Good luck in there.

42:48.277 --> 42:50.013
We say "break a leg."

42:50.045 --> 42:53.515
Well, then flying in the
face of all medical wisdom,

42:53.549 --> 42:55.418
break a leg.

42:55.451 --> 42:56.453
Okay.

43:10.366 --> 43:11.400
We're gonna stay in touch,

43:11.433 --> 43:13.236
we're gonna text, we'll email,

43:13.268 --> 43:14.236
we'll Facebook.

43:14.270 --> 43:15.237
We're gonna send a pigeon.

43:15.270 --> 43:16.238
Oh.

43:16.272 --> 43:17.239
And when we come back,

43:17.272 --> 43:18.707
we're gonna have a party.

43:18.741 --> 43:20.443
- Come on. Let's go.
- We're going!

43:20.475 --> 43:22.511
- Good-bye! We love you.
- Bye, Dad.

43:22.545 --> 43:23.713
Have fun.

43:30.252 --> 43:32.754
Well, that's stating the obvious.

43:32.788 --> 43:33.823
Yeah.

43:33.854 --> 43:35.224
You're on deck, Henry, officially now.

43:35.256 --> 43:37.024
Hey, guess what? Big surprise, babe.

43:37.058 --> 43:40.863
We got to find Hank a bride. Oh.

43:40.897 --> 43:43.399
You're not actually letting
Evan's teasing get to you?

43:43.431 --> 43:45.234
No. No.

43:45.268 --> 43:48.771
I'm gonna miss it.

43:48.803 --> 43:49.872
Am I going somewhere?

43:49.905 --> 43:51.640
Everyone seems to be.

43:51.674 --> 43:53.309
I mean, this one's going
to medical school,

43:53.341 --> 43:55.511
somewhere, you're running the hospital,

43:55.545 --> 43:59.749
Jeremiah's opening up
a lab and his heart.

43:59.781 --> 44:02.150
Maybe it's time for me
to make a change too.

44:02.183 --> 44:04.419
What kind of change?

44:04.453 --> 44:07.357
I don't know. A big one.

44:08.658 --> 44:11.594
Maybe as big as the one
that brought me out here.

44:27.542 --> 44:29.378
Okay. Thanks.

44:29.411 --> 44:32.147
What's going on? Who was that?

44:32.181 --> 44:36.486
What is it? You okay?

44:36.518 --> 44:38.754
Babe.

44:38.788 --> 44:41.291
I'm pregnant.

44:42.457 --> 44:43.660
What do you...

44:43.691 --> 44:46.027
The blood test came back positive.

44:46.062 --> 44:48.264
It's more accurate.

44:48.297 --> 44:52.535
That's why they tell you
not to cheat at home.

44:52.567 --> 44:54.336
We're pregnant.

44:57.940 --> 45:00.310
Oh, my God.

45:05.681 --> 45:07.250
Let's keep it between us.

45:07.283 --> 45:10.053
I just... I want one night
of just us knowing.

45:10.085 --> 45:11.321
Oh, yeah. Okay. Whatever you want...

45:11.352 --> 45:12.454
We're pregnant!

45:12.487 --> 45:13.589
What?

45:13.623 --> 45:15.458
- We're pregnant!
- Congratulations!

45:15.491 --> 45:17.826
Oh, my God! So exciting.

45:17.858 --> 45:19.293
Paige!

45:19.328 --> 45:20.830
Oh, my God.

45:20.861 --> 45:22.363
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
