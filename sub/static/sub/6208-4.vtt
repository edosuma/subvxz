00:18.300 --> 00:19.700
Much better.

00:28.801 --> 00:30.497
Hey, love the look.

00:34.967 --> 00:39.042
1X04 "Terrible Things"
10/18/1996

00:56.099 --> 00:57.599
Where are you.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.800
You didn't see me,
I was never here.

00:59.801 --> 01:02.101
Sabrina,
have you seen Salem?

01:02.202 --> 01:03.602
Um... no?

01:04.060 --> 01:05.903
You are the worst liar.

01:06.004 --> 01:07.404
Come on.

01:07.605 --> 01:11.005
No! I wont go!
I wont go! I WONT GO!!

01:11.206 --> 01:13.706
Ah, is it time for Salem
to be wormed again?

01:13.707 --> 01:16.707
No worse.
I have to do community service.

01:16.708 --> 01:19.708
It's part of his punishment
for attempting global conquest.

01:19.809 --> 01:22.009
As if being a cat for
a hundred years wasn't enough,

01:22.010 --> 01:24.610
Zelda had to put me in a pets
for prisoners program.

01:24.811 --> 01:27.511
I gave you a choice,
you could have done highway cleanup.

01:27.512 --> 01:30.312
Yeah, cats do real well
on highways.

01:30.413 --> 01:34.018
Stop complaining and get your wormy
little butt down stairs in two minutes.

01:34.119 --> 01:35.966
It's time to pay
your debt to society.

01:35.967 --> 01:37.422
Can't I just write a cheque?

01:37.886 --> 01:40.349
I don't know what your problem is,
it's nice to help people.

01:40.450 --> 01:42.456
And what nice things
have you done lately?

01:43.057 --> 01:45.041
Me? I do nice things all the time.

01:45.042 --> 01:46.042
Really?

01:46.043 --> 01:47.843
Since you got your magical powers

01:47.844 --> 01:51.891
all I've seen you do is change your clothes
and make brussel sprouts disappear.

01:51.892 --> 01:53.346
That's not true and I'll prove it.

01:53.547 --> 01:56.389
I'll use my magic to do three nice things
before the end of school today

01:56.390 --> 01:58.072
- easy.
- Not so easy.

01:58.072 --> 02:02.024
Before you shoot your little finger off,
you'd better consider the consequences

02:02.224 --> 02:04.950
or ter-rible things could happen.

02:08.104 --> 02:11.519
Hi! My names Jenny, I'm running
for sophomore class president

02:11.719 --> 02:13.120
and I'm with the outsider party.

02:13.121 --> 02:16.113
Hi! My name is Libby and I'm
also running for class president,

02:16.314 --> 02:17.927
but I'm with the popular party.

02:17.928 --> 02:21.449
A vote for me is a vote for smaller classes
and more funding for the arts.

02:21.450 --> 02:24.766
A vote for me is a vote
for more pizza at lunch.

02:25.758 --> 02:27.238
I'm voting for her.

02:30.031 --> 02:32.122
She's pretty much killing you
with that pizza platform.

02:32.223 --> 02:35.716
I don't get it, why doesn't anybody
want to support the outsider party?

02:35.817 --> 02:38.296
Maybe because you named it
after their biggest fear?

02:46.248 --> 02:47.448
Hey, you got my vote.

02:47.649 --> 02:50.003
Which gives me a grand total of two.

02:50.004 --> 02:51.104
Poor Jenny.

02:51.305 --> 02:54.868
There's nothing like losing to say?
You're a loser.

02:57.812 --> 03:01.098
I wish I could win,
I really wanted to make a difference.

03:12.680 --> 03:14.193
I think that's one nice thing.

03:17.918 --> 03:18.863
Hey Harvey.

03:20.507 --> 03:21.817
Whoa! What's that smell?

03:21.818 --> 03:22.818
Protein shake.

03:22.819 --> 03:26.065
Coach says I have to bulk up if I ever
want to start at running back.

03:26.429 --> 03:28.453
Well... you look fatter.

03:28.884 --> 03:30.154
That's sweet of you,

03:31.019 --> 03:32.579
but you see that guy over there?

03:32.680 --> 03:34.502
That's Randy the Destroyer.

03:34.503 --> 03:37.169
Unless I put on twenty pounds
or he gets injured,

03:37.170 --> 03:38.434
I stay on the bench.

03:38.435 --> 03:39.835
Man, I wanna play.

03:40.436 --> 03:41.631
D'you wanna go in?

03:41.632 --> 03:43.032
Yeah, I'll be there in a sec.

03:44.519 --> 03:45.979
Hey, watch it!

03:49.057 --> 03:50.347
Aw! My hand!

03:51.200 --> 03:52.484
That's two.

03:53.593 --> 03:55.858
Sorry I'm late
but my car broke down.

03:56.059 --> 03:59.331
I made the mistake of trying
to go uphill in my AMC Gremlin.

04:00.049 --> 04:01.889
Why don't you just get
a better car Mr. Pool?

04:01.890 --> 04:03.090
Like a Ferrari?

04:03.491 --> 04:06.549
Sure, y'know what, I'm going to run
right out after class and buy one,

04:06.550 --> 04:10.559
and I'll pay for it with frustration.
Now can we move on to science?

04:10.646 --> 04:12.463
Alright, today we're going
to talk about the elements

04:12.464 --> 04:14.868
and why one can't turn lead into gold

04:14.916 --> 04:17.119
no matter how hard one tries.

04:19.266 --> 04:23.930
..and Radon, which is the heaviest
of the noble gases, don't laugh.

04:24.479 --> 04:27.948
All right read chapter four tonight,
and take showers.

04:28.646 --> 04:29.869
Especially you.

04:31.020 --> 04:34.028
Hey Mr. Pool, are you okay?
You seem especially bitter today.

04:34.029 --> 04:35.678
Me?
I'm fine.

04:37.896 --> 04:39.157
What a mess!

04:39.158 --> 04:40.358
It's just a bunch of papers.

04:40.359 --> 04:41.759
No, my life!

04:42.869 --> 04:46.279
I've been a teacher seven years and
I still can't afford a new briefcase,

04:46.280 --> 04:47.680
I found this one.

04:47.881 --> 04:50.080
I was wondering who T.G.K. was.

04:50.750 --> 04:53.294
Just to pay my bills
I have to work cafeteria duty,

04:53.295 --> 04:55.158
I have to supervise the science club

04:55.159 --> 04:59.603
and on weekends I...
wash Principle Larue's car.

05:00.484 --> 05:02.301
Well maybe you should consider
doing something else.

05:02.302 --> 05:06.337
Like what? I love teaching science,
it's the only good thing in my life.

05:06.638 --> 05:08.669
Well, you have a lot of coupons.

05:09.648 --> 05:10.852
Thanks.

05:11.053 --> 05:13.929
Oh, this one for forty cents off
Fruit Cooks has expired.

05:13.930 --> 05:15.393
No!

05:17.149 --> 05:18.648
who are they foolin' anyway,

05:18.649 --> 05:22.112
you can no more sweeten a cookie with fruit
than you can turn lead into gold.

05:26.185 --> 05:27.599
Or can you?

05:28.237 --> 05:30.870
Wait a minute,
why didn't I think of this before?

05:31.338 --> 05:34.542
Lead, Pb, with mercury.

05:35.650 --> 05:38.186
Thanks for helping me
pick up my stuff Sabrina.

05:38.559 --> 05:39.979
Now get out,
I'm on to some'in'

05:44.363 --> 05:46.373
Yes! Yes

05:46.866 --> 05:48.742
this would turn lead into gold.

05:49.075 --> 05:51.294
That's alchemy, it defies the laws of physics.

05:51.805 --> 05:53.823
Oh who cares,
I'm going to be rich!

05:57.431 --> 05:59.042
That's three nice things.

06:05.110 --> 06:08.403
That was very good Geoffrey
but your E string needs tuning.

06:08.604 --> 06:10.004
I'll be right back.

06:13.808 --> 06:15.501
This one's for Mozart.

06:17.316 --> 06:18.521
Hey guys.

06:19.455 --> 06:21.090
Oh, I see Geoffrey's here.

06:21.291 --> 06:25.294
Yep. Mozart started spinning in his grave
about ten minutes ago.

06:25.295 --> 06:28.537
Oh please, let the
poor man rest in peace.

06:28.538 --> 06:29.963
I don't get it aunt Hilda,

06:29.964 --> 06:31.992
why don't you just use your magic
to make Geoffrey play better.

06:31.993 --> 06:34.378
I mean wouldn't that be a nice
thing for him and for us?

06:34.379 --> 06:36.045
Yes, but I would never do that.

06:36.046 --> 06:39.301
That's right, you must be careful
about meddling in mortal's lives.

06:39.302 --> 06:40.702
We witches have rules.

06:40.703 --> 06:42.103
Who cares about the rules,

06:42.204 --> 06:44.284
I just want Geoffrey
to keep paying for lessons.

06:45.673 --> 06:47.055
Well, better get back.

06:47.627 --> 06:48.856
Must you?

06:52.654 --> 06:55.375
Perfect.
Like it matters.

06:57.247 --> 06:59.909
Aunt Zelda, I'm still a little confused
about this meddling thing.

06:59.910 --> 07:02.392
Why is it you can't use magic
to make someone's life better?

07:02.393 --> 07:05.260
Well because it's impossible to know
what would make a mortal happy.

07:05.461 --> 07:07.705
But what if you knew exactly
what would make them happy?

07:07.806 --> 07:09.889
well, you still can't
predict the consequences.

07:10.090 --> 07:12.091
But wouldn't those
consequences just be good?

07:12.092 --> 07:15.151
Well in some cases
the consequences might be good,

07:15.252 --> 07:19.910
but then again ter-rible
things could happen.

07:23.283 --> 07:25.484
Hey, any word on the election?

07:25.867 --> 07:28.491
Not officially
but this came out.

07:30.209 --> 07:33.027
How can they print that Libby's won when
the results haven't even been announced yet?

07:33.028 --> 07:36.096
It's a weekly Sabrina, they
usually just go on a hunch.

07:36.097 --> 07:37.497
Yeah, well I have a hunch too.

07:37.498 --> 07:40.018
Attention students,
this is Principle Larue,

07:40.019 --> 07:43.880
and I have in my hands the results of
a grand experiment called democracy.

07:43.881 --> 07:44.881
Just say it.

07:44.882 --> 07:48.458
The president of the freshman class,
the winner is Andy Galler.

07:48.459 --> 07:51.109
The president of the sophomore class,
the winner is...

07:51.110 --> 07:52.210
Libby Chessler.

07:52.211 --> 07:53.211
Jennifer Kelly.

07:56.188 --> 07:57.480
Can you believe I won!

07:57.481 --> 07:58.681
Yes, I can!

07:58.682 --> 08:00.482
Hey Jenny, how about
a picture for the year book?

08:01.610 --> 08:03.609
"LIBBY DEFEATS JENNY!"

08:03.610 --> 08:06.650
Hey, congratulations Jenny,
I'm really glad you won.

08:06.651 --> 08:09.923
It's because people like you
voted for me and not pizza.

08:10.124 --> 08:11.324
right.

08:11.525 --> 08:13.121
Hey, I'm having a really great day too.

08:13.122 --> 08:15.454
Coach just told me I'm starting
at running back tomorrow.

08:15.954 --> 08:17.808
That's great!
That's what you wanted, right Harvey?

08:17.809 --> 08:20.483
Absolutely.
You guys gonna come watch me play?

08:20.484 --> 08:21.484
Sure, cool!

08:21.485 --> 08:22.485
Cool!

08:22.486 --> 08:25.961
Cool! And don't be late
'cause y'know, I'm starting.

08:27.764 --> 08:32.275
Libby, I just wanted to say that I think
you handled your defeat very gracefully.

08:32.376 --> 08:33.577
Oh, bite me!

08:36.416 --> 08:39.659
Sorry I'm late but
I was out buying a new car.

08:39.860 --> 08:42.121
A Ferrari, since you asked.

08:42.844 --> 08:46.088
Yes, thanks to the miracle of
science and an educated brain

08:46.089 --> 08:49.074
I now have one
wicked set of wheels.

08:50.175 --> 08:53.221
Okay! Whoever can explain
the crab cycle gets a lump of gold.

08:53.802 --> 08:55.218
Isn't learning fun?

08:56.356 --> 08:58.573
Salem, you're back.
How was jail?

08:58.574 --> 09:02.090
Not bad, there's a guy in
solitary convinced Alan Derchowitze

09:02.091 --> 09:03.938
appeared to him as a talking cat.

09:03.939 --> 09:06.774
I told him I'd call the governor
and plead his innocence.

09:06.775 --> 09:08.865
See? I told you it was
nice to help people.

09:08.866 --> 09:10.902
Are you kidding?
I'm not calling.

09:10.903 --> 09:13.662
Calling who? About what?
Are we getting pizza?

09:13.663 --> 09:17.326
No, I was just going to tell Salem
about all the nice things I did today.

09:17.327 --> 09:19.108
Yeah, but I'm not interested.

09:19.507 --> 09:21.589
I'm interested, tell me.

09:22.329 --> 09:23.812
Oh, but wait.

09:26.525 --> 09:28.017
Okay, start.

09:28.701 --> 09:30.756
See I wanted to use my magic
more to help my friends

09:30.757 --> 09:32.675
so I made a few
adjustments in their lives and it...

09:32.676 --> 09:36.014
Hold on. Didn't Zelda tell you
there are rules against meddling

09:36.015 --> 09:38.260
and ter-rible things could happen?

09:38.261 --> 09:41.780
Not again. Look, everyone's happy,
everything's working out great okay.

09:41.781 --> 09:44.057
There's nothing ter-rible about it.

09:48.375 --> 09:50.385
This is ter-rible pizza.

09:51.887 --> 09:54.813
And a fair catch is called
by the Fighting Scallions.

09:56.008 --> 09:57.644
Wow! Great view.

09:57.645 --> 10:01.066
This is so cool, hanging out in the presidents
section watching Harvey start.

10:01.067 --> 10:02.932
Oh look, there's Mr. Pool.

10:03.854 --> 10:05.475
who's the blonde?

10:05.684 --> 10:06.997
I think she came with the Ferrari.

10:07.260 --> 10:09.335
Oh, no wait,
she's with the guy next to him.

10:10.239 --> 10:12.200
The Fighting Scallions break from the huddle

10:12.201 --> 10:14.001
and Harvey Kinkle
is the lone set back.

10:14.130 --> 10:17.208
There's Harvey. Wow,
it's so great that he's out there.

10:17.209 --> 10:18.638
Yeah, thanks.

10:19.271 --> 10:21.689
Oh, are you sure that's Harvey?
He looks kinda small.

10:21.690 --> 10:24.994
It's first and ten from the twenty-one
and the Scallions keep it on the ground.

10:25.095 --> 10:26.295
Cougar hands off to Kinkle...

10:26.396 --> 10:27.702
Harvey's got the ball!

10:27.703 --> 10:29.323
and he is pummelled.

10:29.324 --> 10:33.659
Oh the humanity, that guy
had no business being out there.

10:34.060 --> 10:35.777
Oh this is a ter-rible thing.

10:44.491 --> 10:47.222
Oh you poor thing,
it even hurts to chew.

10:47.323 --> 10:48.923
No, it's just hot!

10:50.312 --> 10:53.087
I feel so bad about Harvey,
I can't believe he's sprained his arm.

10:53.088 --> 10:54.579
I can't believe that's all he's sprained.

10:54.580 --> 10:57.558
Can we change the subject,
lets er, talk about you being president.

10:57.559 --> 11:00.811
Alright, I have my big meeting with
Principle Larue this afternoon.

11:00.812 --> 11:03.892
Hey Jenny, tell Larue to do something
about this meatloaf huh?

11:04.093 --> 11:06.714
Meatloaf? Hey man, what
about intellectual freedom?

11:07.681 --> 11:10.020
I'd better go,
I'll see you later at The Slicery?

11:10.021 --> 11:11.105
Yeah, we'll get pizza.

11:11.206 --> 11:13.206
Great idea, this meatloaf really gags.

11:15.504 --> 11:17.571
Hey Mr. Pool, smells good.

11:17.572 --> 11:21.244
Linguine with white truffles,
no more artery clogging sloppy Joe's for me.

11:21.245 --> 11:23.779
Now that I'm rich
I have a reason to live.

11:23.922 --> 11:25.379
So are you happy?

11:25.524 --> 11:26.800
Oh, I'll say.

11:26.801 --> 11:29.786
Well it gives me the freedom to teach science
without anger and resentment.

11:29.787 --> 11:32.879
I can now teach for the pure joy of teaching.

11:33.445 --> 11:34.729
leave the whole block.

11:39.579 --> 11:41.786
Hey Harvey... and Libby.

11:41.787 --> 11:44.477
So, did you make it to
the game on Saturday?

11:44.478 --> 11:47.363
Yeah, I saw you start... and finish.

11:48.725 --> 11:50.733
My dads got it all on video,

11:50.734 --> 11:54.008
keeps playing it over and over
saying that I can learn from it.

11:54.009 --> 11:56.288
Well, y'know let me know if there's
anything I can do to help.

11:57.209 --> 12:00.039
I'm a cheerleader,
let me handle this.

12:00.809 --> 12:01.953
Sure.

12:01.954 --> 12:04.037
Well I just wanted to
let you know I'm sorry.

12:04.038 --> 12:05.858
Y'know not like a responsible sorry,

12:05.859 --> 12:09.532
more like sympathetic sorry in a
blameless third party sort of way.

12:10.463 --> 12:11.733
Feel better.

12:12.647 --> 12:14.148
The principle will see you now.

12:17.594 --> 12:18.891
Please sit down.

12:19.158 --> 12:23.007
The reason I called this meeting was to
present my five point program,

12:23.008 --> 12:25.297
my contract with Westbridge,
if I may.

12:25.298 --> 12:26.298
Proceed.

12:26.299 --> 12:28.324
Well the first point focuses
on class size, I think...

12:28.325 --> 12:29.525
You have no authority there.

12:30.184 --> 12:31.626
- I don't?
- No. Next point?

12:32.013 --> 12:34.027
Well I'm also concerned
about arts funding.

12:34.028 --> 12:35.228
You have no authority there.

12:35.429 --> 12:36.629
- Text books?
- No.

12:36.888 --> 12:38.130
- Curriculum?
- No.

12:38.131 --> 12:39.131
Parking?

12:39.132 --> 12:40.732
Huh! I don't even have authority there.

12:41.291 --> 12:44.355
hat you raise are not
to be addressed in this room.

12:44.622 --> 12:46.396
They are decided by powerful men

12:46.597 --> 12:49.109
in smoke filled board rooms
hundreds of miles from here.

12:49.223 --> 12:52.061
It is not your place to question their choices.

12:53.152 --> 12:57.155
They know you Jennifer,
better than you know yourself.

12:57.821 --> 13:02.422
Let's leave the business of school to
the people who's business is school.

13:02.817 --> 13:06.456
Student class elections have
always been a popularity contest,

13:07.404 --> 13:08.930
let's keep it that way.

13:15.819 --> 13:17.074
Hey, how'd it go?

13:17.537 --> 13:20.369
I'm on my second pitcher of root beer.

13:20.673 --> 13:21.970
Why, what's wrong?

13:22.395 --> 13:24.215
I wish I'd never become president.

13:24.492 --> 13:25.858
You said that's what
you wanted though?

13:25.859 --> 13:27.259
Yeah, so young, so naive.

13:27.260 --> 13:28.860
I thought I could make a difference.

13:28.983 --> 13:29.988
But you can!

13:29.989 --> 13:33.559
No. You keep your illusions
but it's too late for me,

13:34.458 --> 13:36.496
I've seen how the meatloaf is made.

13:37.018 --> 13:38.469
Oh Jenny, I'm sorry.

13:38.470 --> 13:40.109
It's a ter-rible thing.

13:43.208 --> 13:44.096
Hey.

13:44.197 --> 13:45.197
We need to talk.

13:45.198 --> 13:47.078
Not now, I've had a really lousy day.

13:50.802 --> 13:52.693
And apparently it's not over yet.

13:52.694 --> 13:54.552
This came in the toaster for you.

13:55.122 --> 13:56.203
It's from Drell.

13:56.553 --> 13:58.370
The head of the Witches Council,
what does he want with me?

13:58.371 --> 13:59.716
We don't know.
I wanted to open it

13:59.818 --> 14:01.456
but Zelda wouldn't let me.

14:01.586 --> 14:05.635
Report to my office immediately
and brings your aunts with you.

14:09.648 --> 14:12.650
I don't wanna go, Drell scares me.
You guys go first and tell me what he wants.

14:12.651 --> 14:14.905
Hey, I don't want to see Drell
any more than you do.

14:14.906 --> 14:16.106
Yeah sure.

14:16.107 --> 14:20.182
Look, we used to be in love
but I no longer have any feelings for him.

14:20.837 --> 14:21.896
How's my hair?

14:22.909 --> 14:24.180
Come on, let's go.

14:26.004 --> 14:27.446
Aw! My foot.

14:34.255 --> 14:36.735
I don't like this place,
it reminds me of the principles office.

14:38.043 --> 14:39.526
Drell will see you now.

14:44.485 --> 14:46.184
You look so familiar.

14:47.133 --> 14:49.842
Hello Drell, what a pleasant surprise.

14:49.843 --> 14:52.463
No it's not,
I summoned you and you're here.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.062
Hilda! What's with your hair?

14:56.073 --> 14:58.301
My new boyfriend likes it this way.

14:58.302 --> 15:00.390
Oh, your new boyfriend.
What's his name?

15:00.491 --> 15:01.391
Um!

15:01.392 --> 15:04.672
Oh well I hope you and ...Um!
are very happy.

15:04.773 --> 15:08.581
Sabrina, why don't we begin by you explaining
to us why we're here

15:08.582 --> 15:09.596
I don't know.

15:09.597 --> 15:11.481
Stop me if something sounds familiar.

15:11.482 --> 15:16.264
Athletic injury, fixed election,
altered immutable laws of physics.

15:16.365 --> 15:17.864
Oh that.

15:17.865 --> 15:19.280
- Sabrina?!
- You didn't?!

15:19.281 --> 15:20.704
I was just trying to help people.

15:20.705 --> 15:25.081
Help is a four letter word like
Dumb' and ?Move' Am I right?

15:25.218 --> 15:26.981
Well first all the people
I helped were happy

15:26.982 --> 15:30.485
but now only one is and he's happy enough
for all three of them though. So...

15:30.486 --> 15:34.317
Now I should explain to you
that when I say ?Am I right?

15:34.318 --> 15:38.664
IT'S A RHETORICAL QUESTION!
Because I'm always right.

15:39.559 --> 15:42.454
Drell please,
Sabrina's a good kid.

15:42.455 --> 15:44.130
And things are hard on her. Her

15:44.131 --> 15:46.580
Her mother's in Peru
her father's in a book.

15:46.581 --> 15:48.841
And I'm in the land of
I_DON'T_CARE!

15:48.842 --> 15:51.699
You're her guardians,
you should have warned her

15:51.700 --> 15:56.587
that if you meddle with peoples lives
ter-rible things could happen.

15:56.588 --> 15:58.627
Oh I did, that's exactly what I said.

15:58.628 --> 15:59.628
So did I.

15:59.629 --> 16:02.285
So did Salem but nobody
made it sound like it was a big deal.

16:05.049 --> 16:08.504
Marge, get the guys
down in ominous warnings to er

16:08.505 --> 16:11.761
tweak up the reverb on
the word terrible.

16:12.495 --> 16:13.714
Terrible.

16:14.285 --> 16:15.617
Ter-rible!

16:17.025 --> 16:20.794
TER-R-R-IBLE-LE,-LE-le-le...
Oh that's nice.

16:21.454 --> 16:22.655
Thank you Marge.

16:22.778 --> 16:25.455
Now that was Marge's mistake.

16:27.867 --> 16:29.842
And now back to yours.

16:29.843 --> 16:33.525
Now the football injury and the class elections
have no global consequences.

16:33.526 --> 16:37.207
You can mess with your pimply,
pubescent, peers all you want.

16:37.208 --> 16:40.610
Alchemy, however, could
collapse the world economy

16:40.611 --> 16:43.890
and reek havoc on MY T bills.

16:43.891 --> 16:49.956
Now are you gonna fix this or should
I give Salem a little, blonde kitty friend?

16:49.957 --> 16:50.957
No, I can fix it.

16:51.251 --> 16:52.812
I mean, I just have
to erase the knowledge right?

16:52.813 --> 16:54.013
I don't have to destroy Mr. Pool.

16:54.014 --> 16:56.580
You've got a day.
That's twenty-three hours

16:56.581 --> 17:00.880
to solve the problem and one hour
to shop for a scratching post.

17:01.856 --> 17:03.174
go on, go get outa here!

17:04.401 --> 17:05.836
Oh, except you Hilda.

17:07.117 --> 17:09.214
Why don't you er stay a moment?

17:11.744 --> 17:15.109
That's it, I'm never going
to help anyone ever again.

17:15.239 --> 17:16.865
He's just trying to scare me right?

17:16.866 --> 17:18.903
Oh look, Marge's teeth.

17:19.277 --> 17:20.532
I've gotta go find Mr. Pool!

17:20.534 --> 17:21.534
Let's go.

17:22.210 --> 17:23.580
What was that all about?

17:23.582 --> 17:25.388
Oh, he asked me out.

17:25.390 --> 17:26.589
I turned him down

17:27.204 --> 17:30.789
and Sabrina, now you only
have sixteen hours. Sorry.

17:32.153 --> 17:33.877
Excuse me, is Mr. Pool in there?

17:34.078 --> 17:37.112
You mean the guy who thinks
he's too good to wash my car now?

17:37.113 --> 17:38.730
No, I haven't seen him.

17:39.995 --> 17:42.448
Mr. Pool, there you are.
I am so happy to see you.

17:42.449 --> 17:44.732
Happy to see you too my
little coupon picker-upper.

17:44.733 --> 17:46.126
Come on and walk me to class.

17:46.354 --> 17:48.027
Hey, look what I just got.

17:48.395 --> 17:50.900
It's a digital personal assistant,
watch this.

17:51.590 --> 17:53.221
I just sent myself a fax.

17:53.370 --> 17:55.589
Well I know you're really
happy with your money but

17:55.590 --> 17:57.164
you know easy come easy go.

17:57.165 --> 17:59.208
Oh did I tell ya?
I'm funding a grant.

17:59.209 --> 18:02.233
It's called Eugene Pool award
for burned out teachers.

18:03.016 --> 18:04.250
Healing begins now.

18:04.502 --> 18:05.651
That's a beautiful dream.

18:05.752 --> 18:09.418
Oh man, I just wish everybody
could be as happy as I am.

18:09.683 --> 18:10.922
- Mr. Pool!
- Hm?

18:12.589 --> 18:14.302
Just enjoy the next forty minutes.

18:14.303 --> 18:15.703
Of course, it's time for science.

18:18.412 --> 18:22.190
Aerobic respiration is correct!
Well done Timmy, here you go.

18:23.782 --> 18:24.996
And remember everyone.

18:24.997 --> 18:28.002
You should learn for the sake
of learning and not just for gold.

18:28.003 --> 18:31.299
Well that's my last lump for now,
I'll just make some more up tonight.

18:31.858 --> 18:34.170
Oh you've got it wired up here.

18:37.295 --> 18:39.199
No! No!

18:39.678 --> 18:41.756
 It's gone!
I've lost it!

18:42.094 --> 18:46.596
I never wrote it down!
Oh this is a ter-rible thing.

18:48.613 --> 18:49.831
Hi Sabrina.

18:50.752 --> 18:51.856
You look bummed.

18:51.857 --> 18:53.057
Yeah, like everyone else.

18:53.058 --> 18:55.726
Oh I'm not bummed, I made
my peace with the universal meatloaf.

18:55.993 --> 18:57.642
- Really?
- Yeah, watch.

18:57.977 --> 18:59.580
Can I have your attention!

19:00.799 --> 19:03.063
I just wanted to say that
I ran for president

19:03.064 --> 19:06.551
because I thought the job was
about more than dances and lunch food.

19:06.991 --> 19:10.446
I was wrong so I think
you'll be better off with Libby.

19:13.835 --> 19:16.466
I'm in control?
Yes!

19:17.094 --> 19:20.954
And I am one step
closer to the Whitehouse.

19:22.727 --> 19:24.991
Nice speech.
So you're happy?

19:25.375 --> 19:27.629
Very, I'd much rather
be jaded than naive.

19:27.630 --> 19:28.630
Who wouldn't?

19:28.631 --> 19:32.129
Hey Sabrina, you know when you
were feeling sorry for me yesterday?

19:32.470 --> 19:34.891
You mean in that blameless
third party sort of way?

19:35.089 --> 19:37.122
Well you should know
that since I've been injured

19:37.123 --> 19:38.523
I've been having a lot of fun.

19:38.876 --> 19:40.683
I'm reading more,
I'm writing more,

19:41.019 --> 19:43.229
I even think my grades
are going to improve.

19:43.230 --> 19:45.517
So this sitting around thing
is really working for you.

19:45.518 --> 19:48.005
Yeah, I'm super happy
not playing football,

19:48.522 --> 19:50.372
just don't tell my dad.

19:51.227 --> 19:53.185
A' equals A'.

19:53.186 --> 19:56.649
Of course ?A' equals ?A', it's obvious,
it doesn't need to be stated. ?B'...

19:57.405 --> 19:58.637
- Mr. Pool?
- What!

19:59.092 --> 20:00.087
Oh it's you.

20:00.194 --> 20:01.088
Do you have a minute?

20:01.089 --> 20:05.471
Yes, a lifetime of them and now
they're going by very slowly.

20:05.472 --> 20:08.958
Y'know I was just thinking that Jenny's
happier not being class president

20:08.974 --> 20:11.417
and Harvey's happier not
starting in the football team and,

20:11.589 --> 20:14.605
well it made me think that maybe
you'll be happier not being rich.

20:14.606 --> 20:17.026
Hm, happier not being rich?

20:18.073 --> 20:19.315
Are you nuts!

20:19.665 --> 20:23.911
Being rich is everything I ever dreamed
of and now it's gone, it's all gone.

20:26.005 --> 20:27.622
Not again!

20:28.192 --> 20:29.751
Sabrina, could you help me?

20:29.919 --> 20:33.297
I'm sorry Mr. Pool,
I'm not supposed to help anyone.

20:34.093 --> 20:35.154
But

20:35.280 --> 20:36.908
I guess one last time wont hurt.

20:38.294 --> 20:40.993
Oh why couldn't
somebody just destroy me.

20:41.616 --> 20:43.292
It can't be that bad.

20:43.593 --> 20:45.806
I have a feeling thing's'll
get better real soon,

20:45.907 --> 20:49.154
and who knows, maybe you'll
find a new briefcase.

20:49.155 --> 20:50.415
Yeah, right.

21:13.858 --> 21:15.967
Steve! Ah, sir?

21:15.968 --> 21:16.968
What is it Pool?

21:16.969 --> 21:19.830
I was wondering, er,
if I came by on Saturday

21:19.831 --> 21:23.219
if maybe I could...
wash your car?

21:23.661 --> 21:25.013
So!

21:25.014 --> 21:29.105
Mr. Rockafeller wants to wash my car.
Y'know the only problem is

21:29.186 --> 21:30.724
I've found a fifteen year old who'll do it
for two bucks cheaper.

21:30.725 --> 21:33.941
I can beat that, I'm having
a back in the same old rut special.

21:35.041 --> 21:36.705
Well I guess I'll see you Saturday.

21:37.206 --> 21:38.006
Oh great!

21:38.107 --> 21:41.522
And er by the way,
that's a beautiful briefcase.
