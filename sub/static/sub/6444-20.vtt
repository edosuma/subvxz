WEBVTT

00:01.160 --> 00:02.957
I think that's him.

00:03.120 --> 00:04.792
Okay, let's go.

00:12.640 --> 00:15.154
Move it back, please!

00:17.000 --> 00:23.074

00:41.800 --> 00:45.270
Clark, pick up the pace, somewhere
between brisk walk and super-speed.

00:45.440 --> 00:47.476
The star witness
testifies in 15 minutes.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.671
Not that I mind being
your boy Friday...

00:49.840 --> 00:52.195
<i>...but</i> I don't understand
why you need an escort.

00:52.360 --> 00:55.591
I don't. I just thought
a nice little courthouse field trip...

00:55.800 --> 00:59.713
...might reignite the journalism spark.
- Well, I hate to break it to you...

00:59.880 --> 01:02.758
...but my ace reporter days ended
when I left <i>the Torch.</i>

01:02.920 --> 01:06.071
All right, then consider it a much needed
get off the farm pass.

01:06.240 --> 01:09.915
Clark, this has been the year from hell.
That was before you broke up with Lana.

01:10.080 --> 01:12.674
There are only so many days
you can hole yourself up...

01:12.840 --> 01:16.276
...before I pull an intervention.
- Wait, I am not holed up.

01:16.560 --> 01:18.551
It's just, ever since I found <i>out...</i>

01:18.720 --> 01:22.110
...that Lionel knows my secret,
I've been waiting for a bomb to go off.

01:24.440 --> 01:27.000
Don't duck and cover yet.
I mean, for all we know...

01:27.160 --> 01:28.798
...he may never even light the fuse.

01:28.960 --> 01:30.871
This is Lionel Luthor
we're talking about.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.597
You okay?

01:49.960 --> 01:51.234
You...

01:51.440 --> 01:52.714
You saved my life.

01:54.440 --> 01:57.750
- I don't know how to thank you.
- I did what anybody else would have.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.912
I'm sorry, I have to go.
Thank you again, really.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.119
Hey.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.350
Now, you couldn't
do that on the farm.

02:06.520 --> 02:08.636
Thanks to you,
that guy's got a lease on life.

02:08.800 --> 02:10.199
Nice work.

02:16.320 --> 02:17.799
Careful.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.792
Holding room checks out.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.514
- Witness has arrived safe and secure.
- <i>Copy that.</i>

02:25.680 --> 02:29.116
There's only one way into this room.
We're guarding it. Get your stuff on.

02:42.680 --> 02:44.716
Can I help you with that?

02:53.000 --> 02:55.150
All right, we're calling security.

02:57.240 --> 02:59.231
Man down.

03:00.520 --> 03:03.159
Man down, secure the area.

03:05.160 --> 03:08.118
- Man down, secure the area.
- He's not breathing.

03:08.640 --> 03:10.596
Call an ambulance.

04:04.640 --> 04:06.358
<i>Give it up.</i>

04:06.520 --> 04:08.556
Die samurai, die.

04:08.720 --> 04:10.278
Anyone want a piece of this?

04:11.160 --> 04:12.752
Take that.

04:14.280 --> 04:15.918
Lois.

04:17.279 --> 04:19.430
Too late, sucka!
Yojimbo, you are mine.

04:19.640 --> 04:21.153
Lois.

04:23.720 --> 04:25.472
Aw, come on, Smallville,
you killed me.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.790
- Where did all this come from?
- Good question.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.316
I think there's a card somewhere.

04:30.880 --> 04:34.429
Looks like Christmas came early this
year, in Hi-Def surround sound, no less.

04:34.880 --> 04:36.632
The delivery guys were unloading it.

04:37.200 --> 04:40.112
- You win a raffle or something?
- Not that I know of.

04:42.320 --> 04:44.470
There you go. "clark."

04:46.760 --> 04:48.751
- And I'll just get to work.
- Who's it from?

04:51.280 --> 04:53.794
I don't need a signature.
This is from Lionel Luthor.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.916
Clark, I wouldn't jump
to conclusions.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.798
I warned him to
stay out of our lives.

04:57.960 --> 05:01.953
- This is his way to buy himself back in.
- I really don't think Lionel would do <i>this...</i>

05:02.120 --> 05:04.076
<i>...but</i> I'll go call and find out.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.951
Clark, do you remember that trial...

05:22.120 --> 05:24.190
...that was cancelled due
to circumstances?

05:24.360 --> 05:27.636
The star witness was murdered
in the basement of the courthouse.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.597
The basement? Are there any leads?

05:29.760 --> 05:32.228
Nothing. And now
the prosecution has no case.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.914
Looks like this story has gone
from legal to lethal.

05:35.080 --> 05:37.230
I guess this is a bad time
to ask for a favor.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.630
You kidding? The times
you've saved my <i>butt...</i>

05:39.800 --> 05:42.678
...you can pull a coin from
the favor bank any time. What's up?

05:42.840 --> 05:45.274
Someone sent me a 50-inch plasma
with all the bells...

05:45.440 --> 05:47.078
...forgot to sign the gift card.

05:47.240 --> 05:50.277
Clark, that's not a problem.
That's winning the trifecta.

05:50.480 --> 05:51.959
- When's movie night?
- Never.

05:52.120 --> 05:54.680
- I sent it all back.
- No, you didn't.

05:54.880 --> 05:57.394
Yes, I did. I'm not gonna
accept a gift like that...

05:57.600 --> 05:59.272
<i>...when</i> I don't know who it's from.

05:59.480 --> 06:02.358
I called Metro Plasma.
They won't give me any information.

06:02.520 --> 06:04.909
- Can you call them, get in their records?
- Sure.

06:05.280 --> 06:07.748
It sounds like a move
straight from Lionel Luthor.

06:07.960 --> 06:12.431
That's the thing that I thought. My mom
called. He had nothing to do with it.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.108
It looks like your secret
Santa remains anonymous.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.634
He paid in cash. If not Lionel,
what about Luthor Jr?

06:19.880 --> 06:22.713
Lex? Why would he
send me a home theater system?

06:23.120 --> 06:24.519
Maybe he's feeling guilty.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.433
Guilty about what?

06:27.600 --> 06:30.831
I don't know. I mean he hasn't exactly
been the best friend lately.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.709
So he also has been known to try
and win you over with expensive toys.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.918
He did say he wanted
to try to find some common ground.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.836
I'm gonna go talk to him.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.998
What's the deal, senator?
Do you not like kids?

06:53.160 --> 06:55.674
Because a no-vote
on Senator Kent's bill is <i>like...</i>

06:55.840 --> 06:58.308
...ripping the textbooks
out of their sticky fingers.

06:58.760 --> 07:00.432
Thank you, senator.

07:01.400 --> 07:02.992
Bye, now.

07:03.320 --> 07:04.878
Yes.

07:09.560 --> 07:12.836
Official warning:
I'm a third-degree black belt.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.434
That means I can't be liable
for any funeral costs.

07:15.720 --> 07:18.473
Go easy on me.
I'm a friend of clark's.

07:18.680 --> 07:20.113
Are you his girlfriend?

07:20.360 --> 07:22.032
Not in this lifetime.

07:23.240 --> 07:25.276
I'm Lois. Lois Lane.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.870
Pleasure to meet you, Lois.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.468
- I'm Graham.
- Hey.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.516
So where's the plasma?

07:34.720 --> 07:37.598
So you're the one who sent over
all the high-tech booty.

07:37.760 --> 07:41.116
You know, I was gonna keep it.
Mr. <i>L-can't-take-candy-from-strangers...</i>

07:41.280 --> 07:43.510
...took every thing back this morning.

07:45.080 --> 07:47.913
- That's odd.
- That's clark Kent.

07:48.680 --> 07:51.274
Can I ask why you're playing
Daddy Warbucks with the guy?

07:51.440 --> 07:54.318
Because in my world, friends
don't give friends $20,000 toys.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.278
In my world they do.

07:57.440 --> 08:00.830
- Is Clark around?
- No, not at the moment.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.595
Of course, he never stays
gone for too long, so...

08:04.760 --> 08:07.228
If you wanna hang out,
you're more than welcome.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.918
I think I will.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.434
I see you stepped up your security.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.871
I had to make a pretty good case
before they'd let me in.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.878
You're not an easy person
to say no to.

08:41.559 --> 08:43.278
I couldn't wait any longer.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.919
I've been sitting by the phone.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.276
What'd you find out in D. C?

08:52.520 --> 08:55.193
A lot of plausible deniability.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.157
From the Pentagon
to the White House...

08:57.320 --> 09:00.676
...no one can verify
the existence of Milton Fine.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.077
He works in a branch
of the government.

09:03.240 --> 09:05.117
Maybe it's more covert than we think.

09:05.320 --> 09:07.117
If he even works there at all.

09:07.320 --> 09:10.835
Those classified documents
he gave you, you think they're a forgery?

09:11.080 --> 09:14.629
No, I had them authenticated,
but that doesn't mean anything.

09:14.880 --> 09:17.348
We have no idea
who this guy really is.

09:17.520 --> 09:19.317
No. No.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.358
Don't worry. I'll find out.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.754
You know, I was only gone
for a week...

09:31.320 --> 09:33.311
...but I actually got a little homesick.

09:34.720 --> 09:37.712
What's so special about Smallville?

09:38.480 --> 09:40.311
Oh, I don't know.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.553
Cows.

09:42.720 --> 09:46.269
Cornfields. Wide open spaces.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.591
I missed you too.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.395
You have no idea.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.315
Hey.

10:45.880 --> 10:47.711
Riddle me this:
How does an assassin...

10:47.880 --> 10:50.189
...get in a completely
sealed room unseen.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.799
You knew, didn't you?

10:52.280 --> 10:53.872
No, that's why it's a riddle.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.877
I asked you how Lana was doing...

10:56.040 --> 10:58.634
...and you avoided
the subject like the plague.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.469
You knew about her and Lex.

11:03.960 --> 11:06.190
I'm sorry, clark.

11:06.360 --> 11:08.874
But I didn't think
it was my place to get involved.

11:09.080 --> 11:10.832
You're supposed to be my friend.

11:11.440 --> 11:13.351
- I am your friend.
- You are?

11:13.520 --> 11:16.239
- Then why didn't you say anything?
- I'm Lana's friend too.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.197
And she asked me
to keep it a secret.

11:18.360 --> 11:20.237
I thought you of all people
would respect that.

11:20.400 --> 11:23.153
You know how dangerous Lex is.
Any friend of <i>Lana's...</i>

11:23.320 --> 11:26.392
...would never let her get involved.
- I wasn't jumping for joy.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.229
But Lana's a big girl.
Where are you going?

11:30.400 --> 11:32.197
Clark, where are you going?

11:32.360 --> 11:34.794
Lana has no idea
what she's getting herself into.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.877
Let me remind you that you broke up.

11:37.040 --> 11:40.112
That means Lana can date whoever
she wants without your permission.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.311
I know. But I still care about her.

11:42.480 --> 11:45.199
And I don't wanna just stand by
and watch her get hurt.

11:45.680 --> 11:49.468
Look, I hate to be the one to say this,
but you don't have a choice.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.756
Let me guess...

12:16.560 --> 12:20.189
...bad breakup?
I've had a few of those.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.231
You're the guy from the courthouse.

12:22.440 --> 12:23.793
You're a tough man to please.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.030
What's the problem,
you don't watch Tv?

12:27.600 --> 12:30.672
- Wait, you sent that?
- You saved my life.

12:30.840 --> 12:35.038
If it wasn't for you, I'd be in a morgue
with tire tracks across my forehead.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.156
It's the least I can do.

12:40.080 --> 12:42.150
How did you find me?
I never told you my name.

12:42.320 --> 12:44.436
That press pass around your neck did.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.398
The fact that I'm familiar
with the area led me straight here.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.072
- Oh, you're from Smallville.
- Drove through last year on business.

12:51.240 --> 12:54.073
Clark, if the big screen's
not your thing, what is?

12:54.360 --> 12:57.079
Help me out here. There must
be something I can do for you.

12:58.440 --> 13:01.637
Your thank you is fine.
I appreciate the gesture.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.711
You don't need to repay me.

13:04.240 --> 13:05.992
This isn't about you, clark.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.559
It's about me.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.234
I don't ever like to be in debt.
And the fact is...

13:10.400 --> 13:12.231
...I owe you my life.

13:12.680 --> 13:13.954
Let me buy you dinner.

13:14.160 --> 13:18.153
- I'm staying in Metropolis. I'll take you.
- Thanks, but really, I'm okay.

13:18.520 --> 13:21.432
You're hanging out in a barn <i>alone...</i>

13:21.600 --> 13:23.556
...in the middle of nowhere.

13:23.840 --> 13:26.035
That doesn't seem too okay to me.

13:39.520 --> 13:42.114
Hey, come on, over here.

13:43.480 --> 13:45.835
Looks like the chicken
finally flew the coop.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.672
Getting worried about you, man.

13:47.840 --> 13:50.434
We were going to dinner.
What's going on with the party?

13:50.600 --> 13:52.113
Made a killing the other day...

13:52.280 --> 13:54.191
<i>...and</i> it's all thanks to clark Kent.

13:54.360 --> 13:57.716
- You thirsty? How about a Mojito?
- No, thanks, I'm good.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.996
- What exactly do you do?
- I'm a headhunter.

14:00.160 --> 14:03.311
I travel the world tracking
people down, you know, for jobs.

14:03.480 --> 14:05.311
I'd like you to meet my date.

14:06.160 --> 14:08.355
Hey, good for you.

14:08.520 --> 14:10.112
Lois.

14:10.720 --> 14:12.790
- Smallville.
- We met out at your house.

14:13.680 --> 14:16.114
I couldn't disappear
without seeing her again.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.911
Lois, can I talk to you for a second?

14:19.120 --> 14:21.475
- How about later?
- It's fine.

14:21.680 --> 14:23.352
I'll be right back.

14:24.800 --> 14:27.030
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing? Lois.

14:27.240 --> 14:29.515
Look, Clark, I happen
to actually like this guy.

14:29.680 --> 14:31.830
So do me one favor and
pretend not to know me.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.274
- Lois...
- No.

14:36.720 --> 14:39.871
Hey, pal, you gotta check out
the view from the balcony.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.916
You know, I'm not crazy
about heights.

14:43.080 --> 14:45.548
Trust me. It's worth it.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.677
Oh, good, I can make it.

14:47.840 --> 14:50.229
It's gotten pretty big right now.

14:59.920 --> 15:01.911
Beautiful night, huh?

15:04.640 --> 15:05.959
Yeah, it is.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.912
I'm Gia.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.436
Hi, Gia.

15:12.520 --> 15:15.717
- I'm clark.
- I know.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.191
Guy like you...

15:18.360 --> 15:20.430
You must have a girlfriend, huh?

15:21.240 --> 15:23.674
Me? I...

15:24.640 --> 15:25.629
...don't.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.631
Do you wanna take a tour?

15:28.080 --> 15:32.073
I hear the view from the bedroom
is even better than the balcony.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.712
What's wrong?

15:45.200 --> 15:47.077
I don't even know you.

15:48.200 --> 15:50.191
That's okay.

15:51.640 --> 15:54.518
Graham warned me you might be shy.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.392
Graham?

15:58.560 --> 16:01.518
He wants you to have a good time.

16:08.840 --> 16:11.513
I'm sorry, I think
there's a misunderstanding.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.878
I should go.

16:19.560 --> 16:21.835
Whoa, whoa, what happened?
Where are you going?

16:22.320 --> 16:25.471
Look, if you wanna do me a favor,
consider us even. I gotta go.

16:25.640 --> 16:27.119
Look, Clark, I apologize.

16:27.280 --> 16:30.272
I thought Gia was just what
the doctor ordered. But I was wrong.

16:30.440 --> 16:32.908
You're a lot deeper
than I gave you credit for.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.310
You must have really loved your ex.

16:36.160 --> 16:38.594
What's the problem?
Let's get you two back together.

16:38.800 --> 16:41.951
- It's a little late for that.
- It's never too late.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.469
It is when she's already
with someone else.

16:44.760 --> 16:47.069
That might make it difficult
but not impossible.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.232
- Who's the lucky bastard?
- Someone I used to call my friend.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.155
That's not crossing the line.

16:55.960 --> 16:57.359
That's just plain wrong.

16:57.560 --> 17:00.791
Yeah, well, if you knew Lex Luthor
you wouldn't be surprised.

17:01.560 --> 17:04.757
That billionaire might be with her now.
But don't lose faith, clark.

17:05.040 --> 17:08.031
If it's meant to be, things have
a way of working themselves out.

17:09.359 --> 17:11.874
- Well, I hope you're right.
- I know I am.

17:12.280 --> 17:14.111
I'm always right.

17:21.760 --> 17:24.115
Rest assured, Fine, we're close.

17:24.280 --> 17:27.715
Viruses are being genetically
spliced as we speak.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.551
Lex!

18:16.480 --> 18:18.391
Help! Help, please!

18:19.800 --> 18:21.916
Call an ambulance. Hurry.

18:24.040 --> 18:25.155
Lex...

18:25.320 --> 18:27.390
<i>...it's</i> gonna be okay.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.919
Chloe called me.
She told me what happened.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.432
How's he doing?

19:22.440 --> 19:24.396
Luckily, his trachea didn't collapse.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.869
And the doctor sedated him
for the pain.

19:27.680 --> 19:31.309
- Where's Lionel?
- Lionel's on his way from Singapore.

19:32.080 --> 19:35.231
You're a good friend
for staying here with him like this.

19:40.520 --> 19:43.353
Someone should be with him
when he wakes up.

19:44.640 --> 19:46.073
Yeah...

19:46.240 --> 19:47.878
...of course.

19:51.120 --> 19:52.633
Do they know who did this?

19:53.240 --> 19:55.435
I gave them a full description.

19:55.640 --> 19:57.198
You were there when it happened?

19:57.360 --> 20:01.114
I was returning some books
and I walked in on the attack.

20:06.880 --> 20:08.233
What does the guy look like?

20:09.240 --> 20:10.958
Dark hair, dark eyes.

20:11.120 --> 20:14.476
About six feet tall.
Was wearing a black trench coat.

20:16.920 --> 20:19.195
Clark, he seemed
to vanish into thin air.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.358
Quite a sweet tooth
you got there.

20:35.960 --> 20:38.076
My dentist would agree.

20:38.920 --> 20:41.434
- I thought you were heading out.
- I was.

20:41.600 --> 20:44.876
But I couldn't get a certain
someone out of my mind...

20:45.040 --> 20:48.828
...someone with a beautiful smile
and apparently a lot of cavities.

20:49.680 --> 20:52.513
Look, if you think I'm blushing,
I'm just a little sunburned.

20:52.680 --> 20:55.433
Well, if you're not too busy
applying the aloe vera...

20:55.600 --> 20:57.397
...you wanna go
see Coldplay with me?

20:57.880 --> 21:00.917
Tonight? Wow, they're
playing in Metropolis?

21:01.280 --> 21:03.953
Actually, Chicago. I chartered a jet.

21:04.120 --> 21:06.156
We'll have dinner on it.
You like Italian?

21:06.560 --> 21:10.189
Graham, if you wanna go out, you
don't have to play the jet-setter card.

21:11.920 --> 21:13.319
It's not a card.

21:13.480 --> 21:14.754
It's a reality.

21:14.920 --> 21:17.388
I work for large corporations
that take care of me.

21:18.480 --> 21:20.198
I should think about getting a job...

21:20.360 --> 21:22.590
...in the whole corporate
headhunting business.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.830
- Sounds like a load of fun.
- It is.

21:25.120 --> 21:27.554
But it can get a little cutthroat.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.438
So, what do you say?

21:30.560 --> 21:35.236
Look, I love jetting off to Coldplay
concerts like the next girl, but really...

21:35.400 --> 21:39.075
<i>...I'm</i> just as happy going down to Jo's
for some Foggybottom burgers.

21:39.240 --> 21:40.878
Then I'll tell you what.

21:41.240 --> 21:43.595
We'll have Foggybottom burgers
on the plane.

21:44.760 --> 21:46.273
Pick you up at 6?

21:47.840 --> 21:49.353
I'll be wearing
my glass slippers.

22:11.760 --> 22:13.830
Afraid the party's over.

22:14.440 --> 22:17.477
Clark, you know Lois well.
Is she a candy or flowers kind of girl?

22:17.640 --> 22:19.517
You tried to kill Lex.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.278
Me? Why would I do that?

22:22.480 --> 22:25.278
You have some sick idea
you'd be doing me a favor.

22:25.640 --> 22:26.993
Well...

22:27.400 --> 22:29.038
...you do have to admit...

22:29.240 --> 22:32.232
...if Lex was out of the picture
and Lana was as free as a bird...

22:32.720 --> 22:34.312
I'm taking you to the police.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.993
I guess I'm not the only one
who's got a little secret.

22:53.560 --> 22:56.757
If your meteor-challenged friend
tried to kill Lex to repay a favor...

22:56.920 --> 22:59.275
<i>...it's</i> not the first time
he's murdered someone.

22:59.440 --> 23:01.237
In fact, he might even be
the Chameleon.

23:01.720 --> 23:02.994
Who's the chameleon?

23:03.600 --> 23:06.194
Hitman for hire.
Number eight on the FBI's Top <i>40...</i>

23:06.360 --> 23:08.396
...and climbing the charts.

23:08.760 --> 23:11.593
He's also the prime suspect
for the courthouse murder.

23:11.760 --> 23:13.239
Which was after I saved Graham.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.991
His trademark
is getting to his victims...

23:17.160 --> 23:18.593
...in highly secure locations.

23:18.760 --> 23:20.034
He leaves no prints...

23:20.240 --> 23:23.915
...no images on surveillance cameras,
and no clues.

23:24.080 --> 23:27.072
Meteor power would explain it.
He said he'd been in Smallville.

23:28.840 --> 23:32.753
Well, unfortunately, there's no record of
camouflage power on the Wall of Weird.

23:32.920 --> 23:35.115
And the name Graham Garrett
didn't get any hits.

23:35.280 --> 23:36.952
This guy's totally off the grid.

23:37.320 --> 23:39.709
If I hadn't saved him,
that witness would be alive...

23:39.880 --> 23:41.950
<i>...and</i> Lex wouldn't be
in the hospital.

23:42.120 --> 23:44.509
- I gotta stop him.
- Well, it's easier said than done.

23:44.680 --> 23:47.478
When you're a wanted man,
invisibility really comes in handy.

23:47.640 --> 23:51.758
Every law enforcement agency
has been after him for the last year.

23:51.960 --> 23:53.712
I'm no typical
law enforcement agency.

23:53.880 --> 23:55.677
Clark, don't get too cocky.

23:55.960 --> 23:59.953
Not only does this guy know your power,
he could very well know your weakness.

24:00.120 --> 24:02.111
How would he know
about the meteor rocks?

24:02.280 --> 24:04.396
Clark, he's the ultimate
fly on the wall.

24:04.600 --> 24:07.114
And he's buzzing over to the Talon
later on tonight...

24:07.280 --> 24:08.679
...for his date with Lois.

24:08.880 --> 24:10.313
I gotta call and warn her.

25:13.040 --> 25:14.519
Hello?

25:57.480 --> 25:59.516
What are you doing here?

25:59.680 --> 26:01.875
Lois, I've been calling,
knocking on the door.

26:02.040 --> 26:04.759
- How long have you been in there?
- About an hour and a half.

26:04.920 --> 26:06.876
- What?
- Hey.

26:07.080 --> 26:08.718
You weren't in my bathroom,
were you?

26:08.880 --> 26:10.472
I just walked in the apartment.

26:11.080 --> 26:13.514
That's weird. I could've sworn
someone was in there.

26:14.600 --> 26:18.309
- Graham.
- You're blaming Graham? It's pathetic.

26:18.480 --> 26:21.074
- Lf you see him, stay away.
- Why do you feel the need...

26:21.240 --> 26:23.071
...to lob a grenade at every guy I date?

26:23.320 --> 26:24.753
Quiet.

26:28.440 --> 26:29.873
He's here.

27:03.680 --> 27:05.875
Amazing what you can learn
as a fly on the wall.

27:06.240 --> 27:09.471
These meteors that fell from the sky
the day I drove through town...

27:09.680 --> 27:10.874
...they might hurt you...

27:11.360 --> 27:14.079
...but they gave me the greatest life
I could ever ask for.

27:14.280 --> 27:16.396
You were in Smallville
the day of the shower?

27:16.600 --> 27:18.511
Luckiest day of my life.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.870
Think using your power
to be a hero's a rush?

27:21.400 --> 27:22.913
Nothing beats using them to kill.

27:23.120 --> 27:24.758
I saved your life.

27:25.400 --> 27:27.038
You should have taken the plasma.

27:27.640 --> 27:30.108
Now that my identity's in jeopardy,
I have no choice.

27:30.440 --> 27:33.830
I have to get rid of you, Lex
and Lana.

27:34.040 --> 27:36.918
- No.
- They saw who I was, Clark.

27:37.440 --> 27:39.317
In my work,
you don't leave loose ends.

27:39.480 --> 27:41.232
You'll never get away with it.

27:41.440 --> 27:42.873
I always do.

28:03.160 --> 28:04.559
Hey.

28:05.880 --> 28:07.711
You're not supposed to talk.

28:08.080 --> 28:10.435
I'm not supposed to
do a lot of things.

28:13.160 --> 28:14.832
Did they catch the guy?

28:15.000 --> 28:16.513
No, not yet.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.631
But they're going to.

28:19.440 --> 28:21.829
Lex, I don't understand
who would want to do this.

28:22.040 --> 28:23.758
Pick a number.

28:24.440 --> 28:27.750
There are a lot of people who want
to see me breathe my last breath.

28:28.400 --> 28:30.994
But I'm not going to
make it easy for them.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.709
I have too much to live for.

28:40.640 --> 28:42.039
Thanks for being here.

28:43.200 --> 28:47.478
As you can see, there's not exactly
a... crowd of well wishers...

28:47.640 --> 28:49.949
...knocking down the door
to be at my bedside.

28:50.120 --> 28:53.510
Actually, I wasn't your only visitor.

28:54.040 --> 28:55.951
Clark stopped by earlier.

28:56.920 --> 28:58.194
Really?

28:59.360 --> 29:00.839
Yeah.

29:04.560 --> 29:07.028
It's too bad it takes
a near-death experience...

29:07.200 --> 29:08.838
...to bring old friends together.

29:11.680 --> 29:13.591
Did you tell him about us?

29:17.280 --> 29:19.316
I don't owe clark anything, Lex.

29:19.480 --> 29:21.072
Especially the truth.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.635
I know you're angry at him.

29:23.920 --> 29:28.072
- But he deserves a modicum of respect.
- This isn't about anger.

29:29.120 --> 29:31.953
I'll tell him when I'm ready,
on my own terms.

29:32.120 --> 29:33.997
Lana, don't let him find <i>out...</i>

29:34.160 --> 29:36.116
...from someone else first.

29:46.960 --> 29:49.030
Lois! Hey. Where's clark?

29:49.240 --> 29:51.879
No clue. He just busted in here,
warned me about Graham...

29:52.040 --> 29:53.598
...and took off.
- Any idea where?

29:53.800 --> 29:55.392
I wasn't exactly paying attention.

29:55.560 --> 29:58.120
To be honest,
I am starting to get a little tired...

29:58.280 --> 30:02.432
...of him thinking I need his approval
just to go on a simple date.

30:02.600 --> 30:05.160
Can you tell me why he's obsessed
with my love life?

30:05.360 --> 30:06.759
Lois...

30:06.920 --> 30:08.558
...Graham's a killer.

30:08.760 --> 30:11.035
A professional hitman.

30:11.920 --> 30:15.230
- Of course he is.
- We need to find Clark.

30:18.120 --> 30:20.554
Clark! Clark!

30:20.720 --> 30:22.915
Waitress said he ran out back.
He can't be far.

30:23.120 --> 30:24.838
You'd be surprised.

30:27.640 --> 30:29.756
Hey, Smallville!

30:35.120 --> 30:36.712
Clark?

30:39.320 --> 30:41.311
- Clark?
- Clark?

30:44.360 --> 30:47.033
- Smallville!
- Oh, my God.

30:47.240 --> 30:48.719
Oh, my God.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.438
Oh, God. Jesus.

30:50.600 --> 30:52.909
Oh, my... Clark! Clark!

30:54.360 --> 30:55.873
Damn it.

30:57.800 --> 30:59.313
Come on, Clark.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.353
- Hey, are you okay?
- Wake up.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.073
Clark, wake up.

31:06.440 --> 31:08.158
He's going after Lex and Lana.

31:36.080 --> 31:37.479
Is everything okay?

31:40.040 --> 31:41.439
Yeah.

31:42.520 --> 31:45.273
I just thought
you were somebody else.

31:45.480 --> 31:47.152
It's just <i>me...</i>

31:47.320 --> 31:49.515
...bringing you a little comfort.

31:54.640 --> 31:57.677
I thought you'd prefer these
to the uncomfortable hospital garb.

31:58.560 --> 32:00.118
They're perfect.

32:11.520 --> 32:13.192
- Lex?
- Lana...

32:13.360 --> 32:15.316
- What's happening?
...get behind me.

32:58.960 --> 33:00.632
Lana, run. Run! Go!

33:26.040 --> 33:27.951
You saved my life.

33:52.880 --> 33:55.075
- Good morning, senator.
- Hi.

33:56.280 --> 33:57.998
Good news.

33:58.160 --> 34:01.277
- You have Senator Wickman's vote.
- That's great, Lois.

34:01.600 --> 34:04.160
So how are you?
Clark told me what happened.

34:04.920 --> 34:06.194
Me? I'm fine.

34:07.120 --> 34:09.588
Getting swept off my feet
by a notorious hitman...

34:09.760 --> 34:12.320
...is just my way of living
<i>la vida loca.</i>

34:12.480 --> 34:15.119
There's no way you could have
known the truth about him.

34:15.280 --> 34:18.875
Maybe. But it does confirm
a very disturbing trend in my life.

34:19.040 --> 34:21.429
And as much as I'd like to deny <i>it...</i>

34:21.679 --> 34:24.717
...I seem to be a magnet for guys
on <i>America 's Most Wanted.</i>

34:24.920 --> 34:27.114
Oh, I don't believe that.

34:27.280 --> 34:29.998
Trust me, you don't wanna
see the rap sheets.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.788
Why can't I meet a decent guy
from a decent family...

34:34.960 --> 34:37.474
...who happens not to be
a psychopath?

34:38.080 --> 34:39.956
Oh, Lois.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.154
You know...

34:46.360 --> 34:47.679
...when I was your age...

34:47.840 --> 34:50.672
<i>...I</i> wasn't dating
Prince Charmings either.

34:51.440 --> 34:54.000
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:54.239 --> 34:57.038
I used to attract the dark,
mysterious type too.

34:57.200 --> 34:58.679
Until I met Jonathan.

35:00.200 --> 35:02.111
See, what worries me is that...

35:02.280 --> 35:05.238
...when my Jonathan finally does
come around...

35:05.400 --> 35:08.233
<i>...I'll</i> be looking the other way
and I'll miss him completely.

35:10.080 --> 35:12.719
Well, you have to keep
a closer watch.

35:13.440 --> 35:17.115
You know, I think we go through
these bad relationships for a reason.

35:17.280 --> 35:21.114
Well, if there's a good reason for all the
pain and aggravation, I'm dying to know.

35:22.280 --> 35:25.272
Maybe you have to get through
all the wrong men...

35:25.440 --> 35:28.000
...so you can recognize the right one.

35:49.160 --> 35:51.754
Congratulations on your
first front-page byline.

35:51.960 --> 35:53.837
Yeah, and you deserve all the credit.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.513
Or the blame.

35:55.680 --> 35:59.195
If saving strangers gets people killed,
it's not the business I wanna be in.

35:59.360 --> 36:01.510
Do you have a choice?
I'm nowhere near <i>super...</i>

36:01.680 --> 36:04.069
...but if I see someone drowning,
I'll throw a rope.

36:04.240 --> 36:06.629
And what if that person's
a killer, Chloe?

36:06.800 --> 36:08.916
What if the world would actually
be better off?

36:09.280 --> 36:11.794
That's still...
That's not your choice to make.

36:11.960 --> 36:14.554
I mean, ask a doctor,
or a firefighter...

36:14.720 --> 36:16.312
...or anyone in the hero business.

36:16.480 --> 36:18.835
You save first
and you ask questions later.

36:19.040 --> 36:21.600
Yeah. I guess you're right.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.911
It's just not always that easy.

36:24.440 --> 36:27.637
Especially when the person you're saving
is Lex Luthor.

36:30.560 --> 36:32.676
I should never have questioned
your friendship.

36:33.920 --> 36:36.434
You were angry. And I understand.

36:36.600 --> 36:40.832
It's not a walk in the park to see the one
you love in the arms of someone else.

36:44.840 --> 36:47.274
Of all the people in the world,
why Lex?

36:47.760 --> 36:50.558
Just like you can't pick and choose
the people you save...

36:50.720 --> 36:54.076
<i>...you</i> can't control who your
ex-girlfriend dates. That's the way it is.

36:57.160 --> 36:59.674
You have no idea how hard it was
to see them like that.

37:02.840 --> 37:04.831
It's like I couldn't breathe.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.274
I'm sorry you had to
find out that way.

37:11.440 --> 37:13.874
I know how much it must have hurt.

37:14.360 --> 37:16.590
But you know, Lana's moved on.

37:17.240 --> 37:20.312
Maybe it's time you started
doing the same thing.

37:44.480 --> 37:46.357
I thought you loved that telescope.

37:48.880 --> 37:50.438
I did.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.556
Doesn't work anymore.

37:57.640 --> 38:00.234
Lex got out of the hospital today.

38:00.400 --> 38:01.992
Well, that's great.

38:02.800 --> 38:04.552
He's a lucky guy.

38:04.720 --> 38:07.075
Clark, when
you and I were together...

38:07.240 --> 38:10.596
...nothing bothered me more than when
you were less than honest with me.

38:10.760 --> 38:12.716
And I don't wanna be like that.

38:19.080 --> 38:20.593
That's a good choice.

38:21.640 --> 38:23.358
At the hospital...

38:23.520 --> 38:26.273
...when I told you I was at the mansion
to return books...

38:26.440 --> 38:28.112
...I was lying.

38:29.880 --> 38:32.713
Lex and I have actually been
spending a lot of time together.

38:35.320 --> 38:37.470
You know, I kind of noticed.

38:39.560 --> 38:41.551
Clark, it's more than that.

38:41.800 --> 38:43.074
We're seeing each other.

38:46.160 --> 38:49.470
And I thought that it would be best
if you heard it from me first.

38:58.640 --> 39:01.029
Lana, I know
you don't wanna hear <i>this...</i>

39:01.600 --> 39:02.874
...especially from me.

39:04.880 --> 39:07.713
- You can't trust Lex.
- And I could trust you?

39:08.320 --> 39:10.675
I just don't wanna see you get hurt.

39:12.320 --> 39:15.949
I know you think you're being
some kind of a hero, Clark...

39:16.400 --> 39:18.311
...but the truth is...

39:19.040 --> 39:21.713
<i>...I</i> don't need you to protect me.

39:27.920 --> 39:29.353
Lana.

39:31.120 --> 39:32.519
Clark...

39:33.080 --> 39:34.559
<i>...it's</i> over.

39:36.080 --> 39:38.116
You made that decision.
