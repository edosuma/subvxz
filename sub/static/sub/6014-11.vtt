00:02.400 --> 00:04.868
I'm on the street the other day,
make a pay phone call...

00:05.040 --> 00:07.270
...go overtime on the call...

00:07.440 --> 00:08.839
...hang up the phone, walk away.

00:10.320 --> 00:11.594
You've had this happen?
What...?

00:11.760 --> 00:15.355
Phone rings.
It's the phone company.

00:15.520 --> 00:17.431
They want more money.

00:17.800 --> 00:21.634
Don't you love this? And you've
got them right where you want them...

00:21.800 --> 00:24.234
...for the first time in your life.
You're on the street.

00:24.400 --> 00:27.392
There's nothing they can do.
I like to let it ring a few times...

00:27.560 --> 00:31.030
...you know, let her sweat
a little over there...

00:31.200 --> 00:33.953
...and then just pick it up.
"Yeah, hello, operator?

00:34.120 --> 00:35.951
Oh, I've got the money.

00:37.720 --> 00:39.870
I've got the money right here.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.678
You hear that?

00:43.280 --> 00:45.157
That's a quarter.

00:45.680 --> 00:47.113
Yeah, you want that, don't you?"

00:58.760 --> 01:02.036
No, they just have to get more cops
on the force, it's as simple as that.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.838
Cops, I don't even care about cops.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.592
I wanna see garbage men.

01:05.760 --> 01:07.591
It's much more important.
All I wanna see...

01:07.760 --> 01:10.513
...are garbage trucks, garbage cans
and garbage men.

01:10.680 --> 01:13.433
You're never gonna stop crime.
We should at least be clean.

01:13.600 --> 01:16.592
I tell you what they should do.
They should combine the two jobs.

01:16.760 --> 01:19.991
Make it one job. Coplgarbage man.

01:20.880 --> 01:24.555
I always see cops walking around
with nothing to do. Grab a broom.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.952
Start sweeping.
You sweep, sweep, sweep.

01:28.120 --> 01:30.918
Catch a criminal,
get right back to sweeping.

01:31.080 --> 01:34.595
- You should run for mayor.
- Nobody listens.

01:35.680 --> 01:37.238
Where is someone? I'm starving.

01:37.400 --> 01:39.231
Think this is him right here.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.311
- Is there a table ready?
- How many?

01:41.960 --> 01:44.155
- How many?
- Is Tatiana coming?

01:44.360 --> 01:48.069
Well, I don't know. I have to call her,
tell her where we are.

01:48.240 --> 01:50.595
I'm very lucky she's even
considering seeing me at all.

01:50.840 --> 01:53.035
Really? I thought things
were going okay.

01:53.320 --> 01:56.039
They were. It's kind of complicated.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.633
Well, what is it?

01:59.400 --> 02:02.756
- How many?
- All right, four. Seinfeld.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.189
Four.

02:04.360 --> 02:06.237
That'll be five, 10 minutes.

02:10.919 --> 02:12.990
- What do you wanna do?
- Let's go someplace else.

02:13.160 --> 02:15.435
- I am too hungry.
- We might as well just stay here.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.397
We haven't got much time
before the movie.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.117
I'm gonna call Tatiana.
There's the phone.

02:22.360 --> 02:23.793
Tatiana.

02:23.960 --> 02:26.394
Excuse me. Are you gonna
be very long?

02:27.960 --> 02:29.154
Lasbrook, four.

02:29.320 --> 02:31.959
- So did I do a terrible thing?
- You mean lying to your uncle?

02:32.120 --> 02:34.111
I couldn't have dinner with him.

02:34.280 --> 02:35.838
Plan 9 from Outer Space.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.956
One night only. The big screen.

02:38.120 --> 02:40.111
My hands are tied.

02:40.680 --> 02:44.116
You know, it's a public phone.
You're not supposed to just chitchat.

02:44.560 --> 02:47.632
Jerry, get menus so when we sit down
we'll be able to order right away.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.950
Can't look at a menu now,
I gotta be at the table.

02:50.120 --> 02:51.599
He knows I'm waiting.

02:51.760 --> 02:54.354
He sees me.
He just doesn't wanna look.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.637
Everything's gotta be just so
all the time with you, doesn't it?

02:57.800 --> 02:59.995
I offered you those cookies
in my house.

03:00.160 --> 03:05.280
Health cookies. I hate those
little dust-board fructose things.

03:05.960 --> 03:07.837
I just can't believe
the way people are.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.629
What is it with humanity?
What kind of a world do we live in?

03:16.480 --> 03:17.674
What?

03:18.040 --> 03:20.110
There's a woman over there
looks really familiar.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.952
Dark hair, striped shirt.

03:22.120 --> 03:23.348
I've never seen her before.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.351
I know this woman.

03:25.520 --> 03:28.193
This is gonna drive me crazy.

03:30.440 --> 03:33.000
- Excuse me.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

03:34.600 --> 03:35.953
Did you see that? Those people...

03:36.120 --> 03:37.792
Look, they're getting a table.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.359
Maybe they were here from before.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.397
No, no, they weren't here before.

03:43.240 --> 03:44.514
Are you gonna be much longer?

03:44.680 --> 03:46.830
I have to make a very important call.

03:53.120 --> 03:55.429
Find out what's going on.

03:56.840 --> 03:58.478
Excuse me.

03:58.640 --> 04:00.995
Didn't those people just come in?

04:01.160 --> 04:03.549
- I believe we were ahead of them.
- Yeah.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.711
- What's your name?
- Seinfeld.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.470
No, no. They were here before.

04:18.079 --> 04:20.355
Kackige, two.

04:22.800 --> 04:27.078
You ever notice how happy people are
when they finally get a table?

04:27.240 --> 04:30.755
They feel so special because
they've been chosen.

04:31.560 --> 04:32.993
It's enough to make you sick.

04:33.480 --> 04:36.119
Boy, you are really hungry.

04:38.920 --> 04:40.239
Hey.

04:50.280 --> 04:52.396
If anything happens here,
can I count on you?

04:53.320 --> 04:54.514
What?

04:55.320 --> 04:56.639
If we decide to go at it.

04:57.680 --> 05:00.319
Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble.

05:00.480 --> 05:03.233
I have to get in touch with Tatiana.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.436
Look at his little outfit.

05:05.600 --> 05:08.876
It's all so coordinated.
The little socks match the little shirt.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.871
I really hate this guy.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.236
Oh, I'm gonna faint.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.118
George...

05:17.480 --> 05:19.710
...who is that woman
In the stripes?

05:20.320 --> 05:21.469
I don't know her.

05:21.640 --> 05:23.551
She looks so familiar.

05:23.720 --> 05:26.439
It's not fair that people are seated
first come, first served.

05:26.600 --> 05:29.751
It should be based on
who's hungriest.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.309
I feel like walking over there
and taking some food...

05:34.480 --> 05:35.913
...off of somebody's plate.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.638
I'll tell you what.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.030
There's 50 bucks in it for you
if you do it.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.353
What do you mean?

05:46.600 --> 05:48.431
You walk over to that table...

05:48.600 --> 05:51.558
...you pick up an egg roll,
you don't say anything...

05:53.240 --> 05:55.071
...you eat it...

05:55.240 --> 05:56.673
...say, "Thank you very much"...

05:57.440 --> 06:00.034
...wipe your mouth, walk away...

06:00.200 --> 06:01.792
...I give you 50 bucks.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.360
- What are they gonna do?
- They won't do anything. In fact...

06:06.520 --> 06:09.637
...you'll be giving them a story
to tell for the rest of their lives.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.038
Fifty bucks?
You'll give me 50 bucks?

06:12.200 --> 06:13.349
Fifty bucks.

06:13.520 --> 06:15.238
That table over there.

06:15.400 --> 06:16.674
The three couples.

06:16.840 --> 06:20.310
Okay, I don't wanna go over there
and do it...

06:20.480 --> 06:23.711
...and then come back here and find
out there was some little loophole...

06:23.880 --> 06:26.519
...like I didn't put mustard on it
or something.

06:26.680 --> 06:28.910
No tricks.

06:29.600 --> 06:32.319
- Should I do it, George?
- For 50 bucks?

06:32.480 --> 06:35.392
I'd put my face in their soup
and blow.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.395
All right. All right.

06:43.560 --> 06:44.754
Here, hold this.

06:44.920 --> 06:47.275
I'm doing it.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.758
I know this sounds crazy,
but the two men standing behind me...

06:58.920 --> 07:02.117
...will give me 50 bucks if I stand here
and eat one of your egg rolls.

07:04.080 --> 07:06.036
I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.191
- What?
- What is she talking about?

07:08.360 --> 07:10.271
What did she say?
What did she say?

07:10.440 --> 07:13.398
- Will someone tell me what she said?
- Twenty-five dollars?

07:16.160 --> 07:18.071
- What happened?
- Did you see that?

07:18.240 --> 07:20.276
- What were you telling them?
- I offered them 25.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.590
- They had no idea why.
- Oh, God.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.230
- George, the phone's free.
- Hallelujah.

07:28.760 --> 07:30.113
Excuse me. I was waiting here.

07:30.800 --> 07:33.439
- Where? I didn't see you.
- I've been here for 10 minutes.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.433
- I won't be long.
- That's not the point.

07:36.840 --> 07:39.035
The point is I was here first.

07:39.240 --> 07:41.117
Well, if you were here first...

07:41.280 --> 07:43.032
...you'd be holding the phone.

07:49.480 --> 07:52.995
You know, we're living in a society!

07:53.320 --> 07:56.835
We're supposed to act
in a civilized way!

08:01.000 --> 08:03.355
Does she care? No.

08:03.520 --> 08:06.557
Does anyone ever display
the slightest sensitivity...

08:06.720 --> 08:08.551
...over the problems
of a fellow individual?

08:08.720 --> 08:11.234
No. No! A resounding no.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.789
- Hey, sorry I took so long.
- Oh, that's okay.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.678
Really, don't worry about it.

08:17.160 --> 08:18.991
How do people fast?

08:19.160 --> 08:21.879
Did Gandhi get this crazy?

08:22.440 --> 08:25.000
I'm gonna go walk around
and see what dishes look good.

08:25.240 --> 08:27.800
I told my uncle I had a stomachache.
Think he bought that?

08:28.880 --> 08:31.474
Yeah, he probably bought it.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.631
So, what happened with Tatiana?

08:34.080 --> 08:36.957
- I shouldn't even tell you.
- Come on.

08:37.120 --> 08:39.554
After dinner last week,
she invites me to her apartment.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.198
I'm with you.

08:41.679 --> 08:45.832
Well, it's this little place
with this little bathroom.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.912
And it's, like, right there, you know?
It's not even...

08:49.080 --> 08:51.548
...down a little hall or off in an alcove,
you understand?

08:51.720 --> 08:53.153
There's no...

08:53.400 --> 08:54.594
...buffer zone.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.439
So...

08:58.600 --> 09:00.670
...we start to fool around...

09:00.840 --> 09:04.515
...and it's the first time,
and it's early in the going...

09:05.120 --> 09:08.590
...and I begin to perceive
this impending...

09:09.000 --> 09:11.719
...intestinal requirement...

09:12.360 --> 09:15.272
...whose needs are going to surpass,
by great lengths...

09:15.440 --> 09:17.158
...anything in the sexual realm.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.670
So I know I'm gonna have to stop.

09:21.320 --> 09:25.472
And as this is happening, I'm thinking
even if I can somehow manage...

09:25.640 --> 09:27.073
...to momentarily...

09:28.600 --> 09:31.512
...extricate myself
from the proceedings...

09:31.760 --> 09:35.992
...and relieve this
unstoppable force...

09:36.160 --> 09:38.594
...I know that that bathroom
is not gonna provide me...

09:38.760 --> 09:41.274
...with the privacy that I know
I'm going to need.

09:41.880 --> 09:44.155
This could only happen to you.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.274
So...

09:46.440 --> 09:49.318
...I finally stop and say:

09:50.880 --> 09:53.997
"Tatiana, I hope you don't take this
the wrong way...

09:54.160 --> 09:55.991
...but I think it would be best
if I left."

09:57.640 --> 09:59.995
You said this to her after?

10:00.800 --> 10:02.199
No.

10:03.720 --> 10:04.994
During.

10:05.160 --> 10:06.434
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.033
Wow. So?

10:09.160 --> 10:11.754
So I'm dressing,
and she's staring up at me...

10:11.920 --> 10:15.959
...struggling to compute this
unprecedented turn of events.

10:16.360 --> 10:18.078
I don't know what to say
to reassure her.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.515
And worst of all, I don't have
the time to say it.

10:22.040 --> 10:24.235
The only excuse she might
possibly have accepted...

10:24.400 --> 10:27.551
...is if I told her I am,
in reality, Batman.

10:28.840 --> 10:31.559
And I'm very sorry,
I just saw the Bat Signal.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.876
It took me three days of phone calls
to get her to agree to see me again.

10:37.080 --> 10:40.959
Now she's waiting for me to call,
and she's still on the phone.

10:42.240 --> 10:44.151
I hate this place.

10:44.320 --> 10:47.915
I don't know why we came here.
I am never coming back here again.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.308
Who is that woman?

10:52.040 --> 10:54.508
Remember when you first went
out to eat with your parents?

10:54.920 --> 10:58.071
Remember?
It was such a treat to go.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.949
And they serve you this different food
that you never saw before.

11:02.320 --> 11:03.799
And they put it in front of you...

11:03.960 --> 11:07.714
...and it was such a delicious
and exciting adventure.

11:08.680 --> 11:11.717
And now I just feel
like a big sweaty hog...

11:11.880 --> 11:14.348
...waiting for them
to fill up the trough.

11:15.960 --> 11:18.235
Oh, she's off.

11:20.200 --> 11:23.112
- Jerry, talk to that guy again.
- What am I gonna say?

11:23.280 --> 11:26.192
Tell him we wanna catch a movie
and that we're late.

11:29.160 --> 11:31.674
Hey. What stinks in here?

11:33.000 --> 11:36.197
Mr. Cohen, haven't seen you
for a couple of weeks.

11:36.360 --> 11:38.715
Well, I've been looking
for a better place.

11:38.880 --> 11:41.997
Better place! Want a...?
Want a table?

11:42.160 --> 11:45.118
No, just bring me a plate,
and I'll eat here.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.795
Bring him a plate.
He'll eat here.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.757
Come on, I'll give you a table.

11:53.760 --> 11:54.909
Excuse me.

11:56.720 --> 11:57.994
We've been waiting here.

11:58.160 --> 12:01.470
Now, I know we were ahead
of that guy. He just came in.

12:02.120 --> 12:04.588
Oh, no.
Mr. Cohen always here.

12:05.800 --> 12:08.792
He's always here? What does
that mean? What does that mean?

12:09.800 --> 12:12.075
Mr. Cohen, very nice man.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.196
He live on Park Avenue.

12:16.680 --> 12:18.716
Where am I?

12:19.840 --> 12:21.751
Is this a dream?

12:22.440 --> 12:25.352
What in God's name
is going on here?

12:26.280 --> 12:27.872
She's not there. She left.

12:28.040 --> 12:31.350
She must have waited and left,
because those people wouldn't get off.

12:31.600 --> 12:34.273
- Did you leave a message?
- Yeah, I told her to call me here...

12:34.440 --> 12:36.032
...and to tell anyone that answers...

12:36.200 --> 12:39.237
...to ask for a balding,
stocky man with glasses.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.755
I better tell them
I'm expecting a call.

12:42.920 --> 12:46.993
- Jerry, here comes that woman.
- Where do I know her?

12:48.640 --> 12:51.837
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hey.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.193
How are you doing?

12:56.360 --> 13:00.239
- How is everything?
- Good, good.

13:02.360 --> 13:03.634
What's going on?

13:04.520 --> 13:06.397
I'm working hard. And you?

13:06.880 --> 13:09.952
Oh, you know, working around.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.997
Same stuff.

13:12.480 --> 13:13.708
Doing...

13:13.880 --> 13:15.598
...whatever.

13:16.800 --> 13:21.715
- You haven't been around in a while.
- I know. I know. Well...

13:21.880 --> 13:23.677
...you know.

13:24.480 --> 13:25.708
You should come by.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.873
Definitely. I plan to.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.190
I'm not just saying that.

13:33.200 --> 13:36.476
- Hi. I'm Elaine.
- Oh, Lorraine Catalano.

13:37.440 --> 13:41.353
I'm sorry. Lorraine, this is Elaine.

13:48.520 --> 13:51.080
Well, it was nice seeing you, Jerry.
And nice meeting you.

13:51.240 --> 13:54.550
Oh, nice to meet you too, Lorraine.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.634
Oh, my God, Lorraine.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.916
That's Lorraine from
my uncle's office.

14:00.080 --> 14:02.116
I am in big, big trouble.

14:02.280 --> 14:05.750
- The one you broke the plans with?
- Yeah, she works in his office.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.558
Now she's gonna see him
tomorrow...

14:07.720 --> 14:09.915
...and tell him she saw me
here tonight.

14:10.080 --> 14:12.674
He's gonna tell his wife.
His wife's gonna call my mother.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.640
Oh, this is bad. You don't know.

14:16.840 --> 14:20.469
The chain reaction of calls
this is gonna set off.

14:20.640 --> 14:25.236
New York, Long Island, Florida.
It's like the Bermuda Triangle.

14:25.520 --> 14:27.670
Unfortunately,
nobody ever disappears.

14:28.360 --> 14:31.079
My uncle to my aunt,
my aunt to my mother...

14:31.240 --> 14:32.673
...my mother to my uncle.

14:35.200 --> 14:38.431
My uncle to my cousin, my cousin
to my sister, my sister to me.

14:38.600 --> 14:41.637
You should've just had dinner with him
tonight and gotten it over with.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.234
- It's just a movie.
- Just a movie?

14:44.400 --> 14:45.753
You don't understand.

14:45.920 --> 14:48.673
This isn't Plans 1-8
from Outer Space.

14:48.840 --> 14:50.114
This is Plan 9.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.998
This is the one that worked.

14:52.160 --> 14:54.230
The worst movie ever made.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.471
I'm really looking forward to it.

14:57.640 --> 14:59.710
I got news for you.
If we're making this movie...

14:59.880 --> 15:01.279
...we gotta get a table
immediately.

15:01.440 --> 15:04.034
Let's stop fooling around.
Let's just slip him some money.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.669
In a Chinese restaurant?
Do they take money?

15:08.400 --> 15:11.676
"Do they take money?"
Everyone takes money.

15:11.880 --> 15:14.872
I went out with a guy who did it all
the time. You slip them 20 bucks.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.672
Twenty bucks?

15:17.320 --> 15:18.753
Isn't that excessive?

15:19.240 --> 15:21.470
Well, what do you wanna
give him, change?

15:21.640 --> 15:22.834
It's more than the meal.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.719
Oh, come on, we'll divide it up
three ways.

15:25.880 --> 15:29.555
All right. Seven, seven, six.

15:30.440 --> 15:32.510
I'm not gonna eat that much.

15:32.840 --> 15:35.070
I'm counting your shrimps.

15:35.720 --> 15:37.517
Okay, who's gonna do it?

15:38.280 --> 15:39.508
Oh, no, I can't do it.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.716
I'm not good at these things.
I get flustered.

15:41.880 --> 15:44.030
Once I tried to bribe an usher
at the Roller Derby.

15:44.200 --> 15:45.872
I almost got arrested.

15:46.440 --> 15:47.919
I guess it's you, Jer.

15:48.080 --> 15:51.959
- Me? What about you?
- Oh, I can't do that. It's a guy thing.

15:52.520 --> 15:55.239
The women's movement just can't
seem to make any progress...

15:55.400 --> 15:57.595
...in the world of bribery, can they?

15:59.040 --> 16:00.837
Give me the money.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.038
How's it going?

16:17.360 --> 16:19.191
Very busy.

16:22.440 --> 16:27.275
Boy, we are really anxious
to sit down.

16:27.440 --> 16:29.795
Very good specials tonight.

16:34.840 --> 16:37.479
If there's anything you can do
to get us a table...

16:37.640 --> 16:39.551
...we'd really appreciate it.

16:39.720 --> 16:41.392
Oh, what is your name?

16:43.320 --> 16:44.833
No, no, I wanna eat now.

16:45.200 --> 16:47.509
Yes, whole sea bass dinner tonight,
very fresh.

16:47.680 --> 16:49.875
Here. Take this. I'm starving.

16:50.040 --> 16:52.156
Take it. Take it.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.589
Dennison, four!

16:59.560 --> 17:01.391
Your table is ready.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.437
No, no. I want that table.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.829
I want that table!

17:06.359 --> 17:08.999
Come on, did you see that?
What was that?

17:09.160 --> 17:11.230
He took the money.
He didn't give us a table.

17:11.560 --> 17:14.551
- You lost the 20.
- Well, how could he do that?

17:14.720 --> 17:16.915
- You didn't make it clear.
- Make it clear?

17:17.079 --> 17:19.799
What a sorry exhibition that was.

17:22.640 --> 17:26.315
All right, let me get the money back.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.158
Excuse me.

17:32.320 --> 17:34.754
I realize this is extremely
embarrassing.

17:34.920 --> 17:38.356
My friend here apparently
made a mistake.

17:38.520 --> 17:40.238
Your name?

17:41.720 --> 17:44.439
- Seinfeld.
- Yes, Seinfeld, four.

17:44.600 --> 17:47.398
No, no. Do you see the girl
over there with the long hair?

17:49.000 --> 17:50.513
Oh, yes, yes.

17:50.680 --> 17:54.229
Very beautiful girl. Very beautiful.
Your girlfriend?

17:54.400 --> 17:56.960
Well, actually, we did date
for a while, but...

17:57.120 --> 17:59.350
That's really not relevant here.

17:59.520 --> 18:01.397
Relationships are difficult.

18:01.560 --> 18:03.790
It is very hard to stay together...

18:03.960 --> 18:05.632
All right, listen. All right.

18:05.800 --> 18:07.392
How much longer is it gonna be?

18:10.000 --> 18:11.718
Be about five, 10 minutes.

18:19.320 --> 18:20.833
So?

18:21.000 --> 18:24.754
There seems to be
a bit of a discrepancy.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.956
- So when are we gonna eat?
- Five, 10 minutes.

18:28.320 --> 18:30.390
We should've left earlier. I told you.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.030
I don't see any way we can eat
and make this movie.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.838
Oh, well, I have to eat.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.956
Let's order it to go,
We'll eat it in the cab.

18:37.120 --> 18:39.350
Eat it in the cab?
Chinese food in a cab?

18:39.520 --> 18:42.273
- We'll eat it in the movie.
- Where do you think you're going?

18:42.440 --> 18:44.317
You think they have
big picnic tables there?

18:45.760 --> 18:48.638
- Well, what do you suggest?
- I say we leave now...

18:48.800 --> 18:51.030
...we go to Sky Burger,
and we scarf them down.

18:51.200 --> 18:54.317
I'm not going to Sky Burger.
Besides, it's in the opposite direction.

18:54.520 --> 18:57.239
- Let's just eat popcorn or something.
- Cartwright?

18:57.600 --> 19:00.273
I can't have popcorn for dinner.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.875
- Cartwright!
- I have to eat.

19:05.480 --> 19:06.913
Well, they have hot dogs there.

19:07.080 --> 19:11.232
Oh, movie hot dogs?
I'd rather lick the food off the floor.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.312
I can't go anyway. I have to wait here
for Tatiana's call.

19:14.480 --> 19:18.029
Let me just check. Excuse me,
I'm expecting a call. Costanza?

19:18.680 --> 19:20.557
Yes. I just got a call.

19:20.720 --> 19:24.793
I yell, "Cartwright? Cartwright!"
Just like that.

19:24.960 --> 19:26.996
Nobody came up. I hang up.

19:29.320 --> 19:32.437
Well, was it for Costanza or...?

19:32.600 --> 19:35.353
Yes, yes, that's it.
Nobody answered.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.313
Was it a woman?

19:39.480 --> 19:40.833
Yes, yes.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.195
I tell her you not here.

19:43.360 --> 19:45.510
She said curse word. I hang up.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.598
She called.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.590
He yelled, "Cartwright."

19:54.960 --> 19:56.154
I missed her.

19:56.560 --> 19:57.754
Who's Cartwright?

19:59.120 --> 20:00.872
I'm Cartwright.

20:02.760 --> 20:05.593
- You're not Cartwright.
- Of course I'm not Cartwright!

20:07.800 --> 20:11.315
Why don't you two go to the movies
by yourselves. I'm not in the mood.

20:11.520 --> 20:13.636
Well, me either.
I'm going to Sky Burger.

20:14.440 --> 20:16.715
- So you're not going?
- You don't need us.

20:16.920 --> 20:19.434
Well, I can't go to a bad movie
by myself.

20:19.600 --> 20:22.672
What, am I gonna make
sarcastic remarks to strangers?

20:23.440 --> 20:25.556
I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.

20:25.720 --> 20:29.076
- Should we tell him we're leaving?
- What for? Let's just get out of here.

20:35.320 --> 20:36.992
Seinfeld, four!

20:38.120 --> 20:41.749
Hunger will make people
do amazing things.

20:41.920 --> 20:44.036
I mean, the proof of that
is cannibalism.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.038
Cannibalism. What...?

20:46.200 --> 20:48.839
What do they say? I mean,
they're eating, you know.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.150
"This is good. Who is this?

20:52.400 --> 20:54.595
I like this person."

20:55.240 --> 20:56.559
You know, I mean...

20:56.720 --> 20:59.188
I would think the hardest thing
about being a cannibal...

20:59.360 --> 21:02.033
...is trying to get some really
deep sleep.

21:02.200 --> 21:05.033
You know what I mean?
I would think you'd be like:

21:05.200 --> 21:07.873
"What was that? Who's there?

21:08.040 --> 21:09.792
Who's there? Is somebody there?

21:09.960 --> 21:11.439
What do you want?
What do you want?

21:11.600 --> 21:13.431
You look hungry. Are you hungry?

21:13.600 --> 21:14.919
Get out of here."
