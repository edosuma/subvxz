00:12.596 --> 00:15.515
Since biblical times,
man has witnessed and recorded

00:15.683 --> 00:18.101
strange manifestations in the sky

00:18.310 --> 00:24.482
and speculated on the possibilities
of visitors from another world.

00:40.332 --> 00:45.545
Today, from the skies
of California, the fields of Kansas,

00:45.796 --> 00:50.466
the rice paddies of the Orient,
the air lanes of the world,

00:50.634 --> 00:55.763
come persistent reports of UFOs,
Unidentified Flying Objects,

00:55.973 --> 00:58.933
which we have come to know
as flying saucers.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.775
In Dayton, Ohio,
the Air Intelligence Command

01:07.943 --> 01:11.112
gathers and sifts data from
all quarters of the globe.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.948
Ninety-seven percent of the objects
prove, on investigation,

01:14.116 --> 01:15.575
to be of natural origin,

01:15.743 --> 01:18.953
while 3 percent still are
listed as unknown.

01:19.121 --> 01:21.706
The Air Force is aware
of the widely held belief

01:21.874 --> 01:24.792
that some of these could be
flying saucers from another planet.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.587
While there is nothing
conclusive in the evidence,

01:27.755 --> 01:33.634
the probing and digesting of information
about UFOs continues unceasingly.

01:35.637 --> 01:41.642
As a result, headquarters of the Hemispheric
Defense Command in Colorado Springs issued an order:

01:41.810 --> 01:44.687
All military installations
are to fire on sight

01:44.855 --> 01:48.483
at any flying objects
not identifiable.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.651
But even as they did so,
the military wondered

01:50.819 --> 01:53.446
whether their scientific know-how
and their best weapons

01:53.655 --> 01:59.827
would be effective in any battle
of the Earth vs. the flying saucers.

03:07.563 --> 03:12.942
July 16. To Internal Security
Commission. Re: Sky Hook.

03:13.151 --> 03:17.280
Summary and progress report from
project director Dr. Russell A. Marvin...

03:17.447 --> 03:22.243
And Mrs. Dr. Russell A. Marvin, without
whose inspiration and untiring criticism

03:22.452 --> 03:24.787
this report could never
have been written.

03:24.955 --> 03:29.458
Married two hours and already
she's claiming community property.

03:34.006 --> 03:36.966
Now that you're married, Dr. Marvin,
you don't have to sneak up on me.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.302
You always did have eyes
in the back of your head.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.928
Besides, it's not safe
when you're driving.

03:41.096 --> 03:42.138
But pretty.

03:42.306 --> 03:45.808
I thought intellectual giants were
supposed to be backwards and shy.

03:46.018 --> 03:49.604
My third-grade teacher, Miss
Hickey, said I was a quick study.

03:49.771 --> 03:53.649
You're starting something you're
not going to be able to finish.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.277
Yeah.

03:57.070 --> 04:01.157
Yeah, today, I've got a hot date
with a three-stage rocket.

04:04.036 --> 04:06.996
Now, please, no interruptions.

04:12.336 --> 04:15.212
Because of recent
scientific advances,

04:15.422 --> 04:18.882
it is now possible to realize
an ancient dream:

04:19.051 --> 04:22.345
The exploration
of outer space.

04:22.512 --> 04:26.682
To prepare for this great stride
forward, we are assembling data

04:26.850 --> 04:31.771
on conditions at atmospheric levels
beyond those hitherto explored.

04:31.980 --> 04:36.734
To collect the necessary data, unmanned
automatic observation posts are being sent up

04:36.902 --> 04:42.657
in multiple-stage rockets, to a distance
hundreds of miles above the Earth's surface.

04:43.867 --> 04:47.119
There, swinging in endless
orbits around our planet,

04:47.329 --> 04:51.832
will be 12 tiny man-made
satellites, or moons.

04:52.084 --> 04:56.420
They will report to us by radio, thus
providing primary information needed

04:56.588 --> 04:59.548
to prepare the way for
our ascent into space.

04:59.758 --> 05:04.011
The effects of gravitational loss,
showers of meteoric dust,

05:04.221 --> 05:08.265
the fierce and undiluted heat of
the sun, the cosmic radiation.

05:08.475 --> 05:11.644
All will be studied and analysed.

05:12.771 --> 05:16.190
At the present time, we have launched
10 of the artificial satellites,

05:16.358 --> 05:18.985
or birds, as we call them. We...

05:22.698 --> 05:26.659
Do you hear something?
Hear what?

05:27.119 --> 05:28.703
I don't hear any...
Shh. Listen.

05:46.596 --> 05:47.847
Pull over.

06:19.296 --> 06:23.174
Russ, it was a saucer?

06:23.467 --> 06:25.885
A flying saucer?

06:26.178 --> 06:29.847
Well, we saw what appeared
to be a flying saucer.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.266
That's all we can say.

06:32.476 --> 06:36.103
We saw it.
We heard it, both of us.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.731
What more do we
need to know?

06:38.940 --> 06:43.944
Well, we have to have time
to think, to evaluate this,

06:44.112 --> 06:46.530
before we sound off.

06:47.866 --> 06:50.284
Let... Let me have a light.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.586
Of course, it wasn't
a saucer at all.

07:00.796 --> 07:03.631
I just shake like this
all the time.

07:32.410 --> 07:36.497
Carol, I want you to transcribe
these notes for my report.

07:36.665 --> 07:38.582
Yes, boss.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.293
But there's one
little thing first.

07:41.503 --> 07:45.131
Now that you're married, Dr. Marvin,
the first thing you've got to learn

07:45.298 --> 07:49.802
is no more passes at the
secretaries during business hours.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.971
All right.

07:54.975 --> 07:58.060
- Or birds, as we call them. We...

08:04.192 --> 08:05.776
Russ.

08:08.864 --> 08:11.407
The saucer sound.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.701
It's on the tape.

08:16.788 --> 08:19.331
You forgot to turn it off.

08:22.294 --> 08:27.006
I remember now.
I turned it off afterwards.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.972
Well, that's one piece
of concrete evidence.

08:36.183 --> 08:40.186
Rocket Number 11 will be
launched in 20 minutes.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.813
Well, we'll leave it for now.

08:42.981 --> 08:46.025
Come on, we've just got
time to get to the bunker.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.869
General Hanley reporting
to Project Sky Hook.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.662
Make it fast, will you?
I'm in a hurry.

08:58.830 --> 09:01.332
Nobody allowed in, sir.
There's a rocket taking off now.

09:01.499 --> 09:06.253
That's what I want to stop. Let
me speak to Dr. Russell Marvin.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.968
West Gate to Bunker Number 2.

09:13.178 --> 09:15.012
Dr. Marvin.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.641
Bunker Number 2,
Marvin speaking.

09:18.850 --> 09:21.769
This is the West Gate, sir.
General Hanley wants you.

09:21.937 --> 09:25.481
Oh, put him on.
Carol, it's your father.

09:25.690 --> 09:28.484
Calling from Panama?
No, right here at the project.

09:28.693 --> 09:29.860
Hello, Russ?

09:30.028 --> 09:33.864
Hello. Well, welcome home, general.
What's the news from Panama?

09:34.074 --> 09:35.491
It's bad, I'm afraid.

09:35.659 --> 09:38.452
I think you ought to hear what I found
before you send up another rocket.

09:38.662 --> 09:40.287
Can you possibly put it off?

09:40.455 --> 09:44.291
I'm afraid I can't, we're tied to a
definite schedule of launchings.

09:44.501 --> 09:47.544
Wait a minute, uh, there's
something else I wanted...

09:47.754 --> 09:49.380
Just a minute.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.715
It's your privilege.

09:52.550 --> 09:53.801
Hi, Dad.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.344
What is it, honey?

09:55.512 --> 09:56.929
I just wanted to hear your voice

09:57.138 --> 09:59.515
and tell you Russ and I
were married last night.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.100
Married?

10:01.268 --> 10:03.310
Forgive us for not letting
you know, darling.

10:05.939 --> 10:10.442
I've gotta hang up. Let's have
dinner tonight. Can you?

10:10.652 --> 10:13.195
Don't forget. Bye.

10:18.827 --> 10:21.453
Fourteen, 13, 12,

10:21.663 --> 10:27.710
11, 10, nine, eight,
seven, six,

10:27.961 --> 10:33.382
five, four, three, two, one.

10:45.687 --> 10:48.772
I know how the designer feels
hearing a thing like this,

10:48.982 --> 10:52.901
but Project Sky Hook hasn't worked out
the way the Defense Department hoped.

10:53.069 --> 10:56.655
Tell me, how many birds
have you sent up so far?

10:56.823 --> 10:58.657
Eleven, counting today's.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.744
And how many are you
in contact with right now?

11:01.911 --> 11:03.370
Just one. Today's.

11:03.580 --> 11:06.749
I admit we haven't been able
to track them visually so far,

11:06.916 --> 11:08.250
but we'll correct that.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.085
Don't be too sure
of that.

11:10.253 --> 11:12.629
We can certainly tune them in
if they're up there.

11:12.839 --> 11:17.051
What I'm trying to tell you is
that they're no longer up there.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.511
That wasn't a meteorite
that fell on Panama.

11:19.721 --> 11:24.183
It was the burned remains of Number
7. I made sure of that myself.

11:24.392 --> 11:25.517
What?

11:25.685 --> 11:28.437
And Intelligence has reports
now which convince us

11:28.646 --> 11:31.357
that 1 and 3 fell over Africa,

11:31.524 --> 11:35.819
Number 5 around the North Pole,
and 9 and 10 along the Andes.

11:36.946 --> 11:41.367
The rest can be presumed to have
been lost someplace at sea.

11:41.534 --> 11:42.868
What happens to them?

11:43.078 --> 11:45.704
Apparently they blow up
in outer space.

11:45.914 --> 11:49.124
Why? There's nothing
explosive in them.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.168
You can take it from me,

11:51.336 --> 11:55.130
when a rocket's blasted off, it should
circle the Earth for a long time.

11:55.340 --> 11:58.717
That is, unless...
Russ? Dad?

11:59.219 --> 12:00.928
Unless what?

12:01.096 --> 12:05.140
Unless someone, something, shoots them
down as fast as we set them up there.

12:05.308 --> 12:08.060
Why, no gun in the world
can shoot that high.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.938
No. No, of course not.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.941
Bring spoons for your coffee.

12:21.616 --> 12:22.866
Ah, my special barbecue.

12:23.034 --> 12:26.245
Mm-hm. That's to make up for not
telling you about our getting married.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.122
It was kind of sudden
for us too.

12:28.289 --> 12:30.582
Sudden? I've only been
after him for a year.

12:30.750 --> 12:34.128
I don't need to tell you,
both of you, how pleased I am.

12:34.295 --> 12:38.841
Well, I'm glad of that. I wouldn't
like it very much if you weren't.

12:40.051 --> 12:41.677
Thank you.

12:45.056 --> 12:48.725
Russ, what were you
driving at back there,

12:48.935 --> 12:53.147
about something shooting
down one of the satellites?

12:53.690 --> 12:57.526
General, we saw a strange
thing this afternoon.

12:57.694 --> 13:01.864
We saw what appeared
to be a flying saucer.

13:02.031 --> 13:05.367
A flying saucer?
It nearly ran into us.

13:05.535 --> 13:07.411
You're sure of it?

13:07.579 --> 13:10.914
Both Carol and I are subject to
the same atmospheric disturbances

13:11.082 --> 13:13.208
that may have affected
other observers,

13:13.376 --> 13:16.753
but there is a qualitative difference
when you're a scientist.

13:16.921 --> 13:19.006
We do have one piece
of supporting evidence:

13:19.174 --> 13:21.675
An accidental recording
of the sounds it made.

13:21.843 --> 13:25.929
The tape is in the lab at the project.
I'd like you to hear it tomorrow.

13:26.097 --> 13:28.098
You both saw this?
Yes.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.063
Excuse me.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.070
From Captain Holoway, sir.
Oh.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.490
Will you sign here, please?

13:45.033 --> 13:48.410
Who's Holoway?
He's on monitor duty this evening.

13:57.420 --> 14:00.047
They've just lost contact
with Number 11.

14:00.215 --> 14:02.591
Oh, Russ,
I'm sorry.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.093
Is it still in range
of our receivers?

14:05.261 --> 14:07.429
If it hasn't been knocked down.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.056
Look.

14:10.892 --> 14:12.184
What are those lights?

14:12.352 --> 14:14.686
They're what the pilots
call foo lights.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.439
St. Elmo's Fire,
in ancient times.

14:17.607 --> 14:20.692
The superstitious regard them
as omens of things to come.

14:20.860 --> 14:24.446
The best science has been able to make out
of them is that they're electric particles

14:24.614 --> 14:28.408
agitated by moving air. Same
principle as the aurora borealis.

14:28.576 --> 14:33.330
There have been so many around the project the last
couple of days, we all just take them for granted.

14:33.540 --> 14:37.584
Bird 11 ought to be visible in the sky right
now, on its second lap around the world.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.795
Look, there it is.

14:44.676 --> 14:47.052
Was that it?
Yes.

14:47.262 --> 14:50.472
Well, surely you're not going to
send up Number 12 tomorrow after this?

14:50.640 --> 14:52.307
I have to.
Why?

14:52.475 --> 14:56.061
With a television pickup, cameras and
microphone. I should've done it before.

14:56.229 --> 15:00.357
This time I'm gonna know what's happening
up there and know the reason why.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.859
Come on, let's finish
our dinner.

15:17.667 --> 15:21.128
Checking TV pickup.
Getting a good image?

15:21.879 --> 15:23.380
Fine.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.425
TV's okay. I'll be down
in a couple of minutes.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.927
Tell them to hurry it up.

15:32.932 --> 15:36.852
Do you notice anything different
since you were here last?

15:39.439 --> 15:41.231
Soundproofing?
That's right.

15:41.399 --> 15:44.735
You could fire a cannon off outside
and you couldn't hear a thing down here.

15:44.902 --> 15:47.154
Number 12 okay for takeoff.

15:47.322 --> 15:51.116
Well, as an old rocket man from way
back, I'd rather watch from ground level.

15:51.284 --> 15:54.202
Dr. Marvin. Dr. Marvin.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.038
Marvin here.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.711
You getting ready for a siege?

16:02.879 --> 16:05.756
Well, Russ and I are gonna take turns
monitoring this one ourselves.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.424
For days, if necessary.

16:07.592 --> 16:11.803
Soundproof privacy and the last
word in scientific solitude.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.474
Happy honeymoon, darling.
Thanks, Dad.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.774
Prepare rocket for launching.

16:24.859 --> 16:27.319
Prepare rocket for launching.

16:31.532 --> 16:34.993
Rocket Number 12 will be
launched in five minutes.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.381
Four minutes to zero.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.721
Check. Take it up at zero,
Major Kimberly.

16:54.889 --> 16:55.931
Okay.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.684
Stand by.

17:03.481 --> 17:05.648
Observation Tower A, come in.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.068
Evans, Radar to Tower A.

17:09.153 --> 17:11.613
Observation Tower A,
Sergeant Nash.

17:11.781 --> 17:14.281
UFO due west, approaching fast.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.702
What does it look like?
Can't tell yet.

17:16.868 --> 17:19.162
I'll call when I get a better
reading on my scope.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.872
Do that.

17:21.207 --> 17:22.665
As you were, sergeant.

17:22.834 --> 17:26.336
Unidentified flying object reported
due west, sir. Probably a buzzard.

17:28.881 --> 17:33.009
Sergeant Nash,
Observation Tower A. What?

17:34.303 --> 17:37.764
Forget it, Walters,
this is no time for gags.

17:37.932 --> 17:40.308
It's two minutes to zero.

17:41.477 --> 17:45.230
Sentry at West Gate has
spotted a flying saucer, sir.

17:46.357 --> 17:48.442
Evans, Radar to Tower A.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.527
Tower A, Nash.

17:50.695 --> 17:52.821
I got a better reading
on my scope, sergeant.

17:52.989 --> 17:55.615
That UFO is over
the west sentry post.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.576
It look like a flying
saucer, Evans?

17:57.744 --> 17:59.077
Yes, it does.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.126
Sky Hook Control to
approaching object.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.547
What is it?

18:11.966 --> 18:13.675
I wouldn't know.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.222
Connect me with Dr. Marvin's lab.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.150
The line is dead.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.620
Look at that, general.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.550
It's landing.

19:32.964 --> 19:35.090
Battery, prepare to fire.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.302
Fire!

19:46.561 --> 19:51.231
They set up an electronic screen.
The artillery doesn't penetrate.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.104
Lines are out.

20:31.814 --> 20:34.232
Abandon all
firing positions.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.156
Mike's gone dead.

20:41.616 --> 20:43.408
Try the phone.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.712
The operator doesn't answer.

20:57.048 --> 20:58.423
Look.

21:11.771 --> 21:15.315
What's happening?
I don't know. I...

22:05.241 --> 22:07.242
I'm scared, Russ.

22:08.703 --> 22:11.830
They'll...
They'll dig us out.

23:05.051 --> 23:08.595
Where am I? What...?

23:08.804 --> 23:13.224
We are speaking to you through the
translating device above your head.

23:22.151 --> 23:23.902
Can you understand us?

23:24.111 --> 23:27.697
Yes, and I hope you
can understand me.

23:29.700 --> 23:32.494
Whoever you are,
whatever you are,

23:32.661 --> 23:34.996
you'll regret what you
did at the project.

23:35.164 --> 23:39.501
Perhaps you can explain
why, after contacting Dr. Marvin,

23:39.668 --> 23:41.753
we were met with violence.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.339
You've contacted Dr. Marvin?

23:44.799 --> 23:46.925
We spoke to him.

23:48.302 --> 23:54.516
All he heard was meaningless sounds.
The same kind of sounds I just heard.

23:54.725 --> 23:58.520
We had hoped a sufficient adjustment
for the time differential between us

23:58.687 --> 24:00.021
would have been made.

24:03.109 --> 24:04.901
I don't understand.

24:05.111 --> 24:10.031
Evidently, you do not realize you
are in an interstellar conveyance.

24:10.241 --> 24:14.702
You are already outside the
atmosphere of your own planet.

24:14.912 --> 24:18.540
As a prisoner, all I am
required to tell you

24:18.707 --> 24:22.293
is that I am General John Hanley
of the United States Army.

24:43.524 --> 24:49.112
These are all the facts leading up to the
rocket explosion at Operation Sky Hook.

24:49.613 --> 24:54.909
To the best of our knowledge, my wife
and I are the only ones left alive,

24:55.077 --> 24:58.872
since we have not seen or
heard anyone for hours.

24:59.248 --> 25:02.000
The air is becoming toxic.

25:02.376 --> 25:04.502
In the event of our death,

25:04.670 --> 25:09.716
this report, together with the recording
of the saucer sounds on this tape,

25:09.884 --> 25:13.678
constitute all
the data we have.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.305
The batteries are failing.

25:16.056 --> 25:18.725
The recorder is not
running up to speed.

25:18.893 --> 25:21.644
This is Dr. Russell A. Marvin.

25:36.410 --> 25:38.828
Russ? Where are you?

25:39.038 --> 25:43.082
It's all right, honey. The gas
generator stopped, that's all.

25:43.751 --> 25:47.462
Please come close.
I'm afraid of the darkness.

25:48.172 --> 25:51.966
Dr. Russell Marvin.

25:52.134 --> 25:53.218
The tape.

25:53.385 --> 25:58.598
It is very urgent that we meet.

25:58.807 --> 26:02.143
We will appear tomorrow

26:02.353 --> 26:06.272
at Operation Sky Hook

26:06.440 --> 26:12.153
when your sun is exactly

26:12.363 --> 26:16.532
over your local...

26:21.622 --> 26:24.249
That's the sound of the saucer
we heard on the tape.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.668
The message was sent
at an accelerated speed

26:26.835 --> 26:29.045
so it just sounded
like gibberish to us.

26:29.213 --> 26:32.632
When the batteries died,
the tape slowed down

26:32.800 --> 26:35.635
and the voice
became clear.

26:39.390 --> 26:42.308
If I'd only figured
it out before,

26:42.810 --> 26:46.479
maybe we wouldn't have
been trapped down here.

26:57.449 --> 27:02.537
What had snuffed out hundreds of lives and
leveled an installation worth millions of dollars?

27:02.705 --> 27:05.581
An aroused public
demanded an answer,

27:05.791 --> 27:10.044
and the federal government dedicated the strength
of all of its branches to the task of finding one.

27:10.587 --> 27:13.423
However, when Dr. Marvin
and his wife were rescued,

27:13.590 --> 27:17.802
the answer was to be found in the
experience of the only two human survivors

27:18.012 --> 27:24.017
and in a reel of tape recording they
carried to Washington, D.C. And the Pentagon.

27:38.282 --> 27:41.534
- Operation Sky Hook.

27:41.910 --> 27:44.203
There can't be any
doubt about what it means:

27:44.371 --> 27:47.707
A landing at the project was
proposed on the day of the disaster.

27:47.875 --> 27:49.542
There was to have
been a meeting.

27:49.710 --> 27:52.795
If I couldn't keep the appointment,
a message was to be sent

27:52.963 --> 27:56.215
on a designated wavelength by
ordinary shortwave transmission.

27:56.383 --> 27:58.968
Does anyone want to have
the recording played again?

27:59.845 --> 28:01.763
You've heard it a dozen times.

28:01.930 --> 28:05.099
My wife and I, for three days and
nights, have been telling what we knew.

28:05.267 --> 28:08.686
We've been before every committee,
commission and review board in Washington.

28:08.854 --> 28:10.480
It's time we decided
to do something.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.482
The tape is by no
means conclusive.

28:12.649 --> 28:16.944
Certainly doesn't prove that your so-called flying
saucer caused the destruction of Operation Sky Hook.

28:17.154 --> 28:18.363
I grant you that.

28:18.530 --> 28:22.408
A strange voice, a set of instructions
that might have come from anywhere.

28:22.618 --> 28:24.660
Well, has anyone a better
idea of what happened?

28:24.828 --> 28:27.622
Personally, I'm inclined to accept
Dr. Marvin's conclusion

28:27.790 --> 28:30.708
about the connection between
the message and the disaster.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.418
All right,
so am I.

28:32.961 --> 28:37.382
Then why not let me try to contact them,
meet them, find out what this is all about.

28:37.549 --> 28:40.009
If we are to be confronted with
a hostile and unknown power,

28:40.177 --> 28:43.137
any decision to meet with them
must be made at the cabinet level.

28:43.305 --> 28:46.766
Well, I just hope that while we're
waiting, another disaster doesn't occur.

28:47.267 --> 28:49.560
We're pressing for the
earliest possible action.

28:50.104 --> 28:52.355
The secretary of state is
flying back from Europe,

28:52.523 --> 28:54.774
the secretary of defense is
returning from the Pacific.

28:54.942 --> 28:57.402
If a meeting could be
arranged in the meantime,

28:57.569 --> 28:59.654
the only risk
would be to me.

28:59.822 --> 29:02.490
I feel personally responsible
for what happened.

29:02.658 --> 29:04.158
I was in charge.

29:04.326 --> 29:07.453
Hundreds of lives were lost.
My own wife's father...

29:07.621 --> 29:10.957
If I had the authority, I'd grant
it to you. But we will have to wait.

29:11.125 --> 29:14.836
But I promise you that we will recommend
that you be authorized to make radio contact

29:15.003 --> 29:16.963
and meet with...

29:17.798 --> 29:20.174
With whoever
they are.

29:22.386 --> 29:25.054
Are we through for the night?
Yes,

29:25.222 --> 29:27.682
but we're going to ask you
to remain at your hotel.

29:29.393 --> 29:30.977
You mean I'm under detention?

29:31.270 --> 29:33.729
You may be needed
at any time.

29:33.897 --> 29:36.482
Major Huglin is
assigned as your liaison.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.904
Good night.
Good night.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.657
Dr. Marvin.

29:44.825 --> 29:47.743
Dr. Marvin, I don't like this watchdog
routine any better than you do.

29:47.911 --> 29:49.996
I'm under orders,
I have a job to do.

29:50.164 --> 29:52.707
We're both on
the same side.

29:52.875 --> 29:56.836
I'm sorry. I'm just tired and worried.
I know.

29:57.045 --> 30:00.631
Well, you were in there. You heard
both sides. Who do you agree with?

30:00.799 --> 30:04.343
I agree with you as far as the urgency
is concerned, but they're right too.

30:04.511 --> 30:07.430
They're responsible to a chain of
command, they have to be careful,

30:07.598 --> 30:11.267
and this thing may be too
big to allow for mistakes.

31:23.715 --> 31:30.388
Russell Marvin calling on
225.6 megacycles. Over.

31:34.977 --> 31:41.107
Dr. Russell Marvin calling on 225.6
megacycles as per instructions.

31:41.316 --> 31:44.485
Are you listening?
If you hear me, please reply.

31:44.653 --> 31:47.989
I am tuned in on the same
wavelength. Over.

31:48.156 --> 31:51.742
We hear you,
Dr. Marvin, and we understand you.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.661
Do you understand us?

31:54.454 --> 31:55.955
Yes.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.416
Who are you?

31:58.625 --> 32:05.006
Listen. It is now 9:30 a. m. Earth time,
Greenwich Meridian Time.

32:05.173 --> 32:10.303
We will be waiting at exactly 11:00 a.
m. At the shore of the Chesapeake Bay,

32:10.470 --> 32:12.805
where the North Beach Road
reaches the sea.

32:13.640 --> 32:17.351
Do not raise an alarm,
and keep this appointment.

32:17.853 --> 32:20.229
Listen to me. I can't
keep the appointment.

32:20.397 --> 32:23.232
I'm under orders. I'll be able
to meet you in a few days.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.610
Do you hear me? Over.

32:25.819 --> 32:27.820
Russ?
Hello, hello.

32:28.030 --> 32:31.407
Dr. Russell Marvin calling
on 225.6 megacycles.

32:31.575 --> 32:35.369
Do you hear me?
Please come in. Over.

32:39.082 --> 32:43.294
Eleven o'clock Greenwich
time. It'll be 6:00 here.

32:43.462 --> 32:45.338
I can just make it.

32:45.547 --> 32:48.382
You're not going. I heard you
say you're under orders.

32:48.550 --> 32:51.552
I didn't arrange this meeting.
I just asked them to wait.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.346
Who ordered that radio?

32:53.513 --> 32:56.641
I did, today. I was hoping they'd
give me the go-ahead and let me use it.

32:56.808 --> 32:59.852
You can't go.
I've already lost Dad.

33:00.020 --> 33:01.729
You shouldn't have called them.

33:01.897 --> 33:03.272
Well, maybe I shouldn't have

33:03.440 --> 33:05.066
and maybe I should.

33:05.233 --> 33:08.361
But it's started now and I've
got to go through with it.

33:08.528 --> 33:13.824
But it's not your job alone.
Call someone! Call Major Huglin!

33:18.830 --> 33:21.916
Room 312, Major Huglin.
Hurry, please.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.299
Hello?

33:30.634 --> 33:33.177
Yes. Yes.

33:33.387 --> 33:34.887
Thanks.

33:35.555 --> 33:39.892
Well, call the garage.
Tell them not to give him a car.

33:40.102 --> 33:42.978
Tell them he's sick,
anything, out of his mind.

33:43.146 --> 33:45.940
I'll be right down to take care of it.

33:48.527 --> 33:50.653
Sure thing, Mrs. Marvin.

33:51.488 --> 33:54.699
Frank, may I have
my car, please?

33:55.617 --> 33:57.326
Gee, Dr. Marvin, I can't.

33:57.494 --> 34:01.580
I was talking to your wife on
the phone and she said that I...

34:08.797 --> 34:11.924
But, Dr. Marvin, I can't
let you have the car.

34:12.092 --> 34:13.467
Get out of my way, Frank.

34:13.635 --> 34:16.594
Please, Dr. Marvin, I don't
want to lose my job. Ooh!

34:42.121 --> 34:46.125
There he is. See if you
can get him on the radio.

34:46.710 --> 34:51.839
Hello, Russ. This is Carol.
Russ, come in.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.592
He won't answer me.

34:59.014 --> 35:00.765
Wait for us, Russ.

35:00.974 --> 35:04.351
Major Huglin and I
wanna talk to you.

36:30.063 --> 36:32.773
Russ, please come back
with us.

36:34.317 --> 36:36.861
I'm sorry, but I have to do
my job. Let's go back.

36:38.071 --> 36:39.405
Please come in.

36:39.614 --> 36:42.032
Come on, let's get out of here.
No, wait.

36:42.200 --> 36:45.703
With your friends, Dr. Marvin.

37:01.845 --> 37:03.429
I'm coming
with you.

37:03.597 --> 37:06.056
Please come in. All of you.

37:06.224 --> 37:07.933
I'm gonna phone
headquarters.

37:08.101 --> 37:10.728
You'd better do
as they say.

38:02.238 --> 38:05.157
We must be thousands of
miles away from the Earth.

38:05.325 --> 38:07.159
And in a matter
of seconds.

38:07.369 --> 38:09.620
You are many miles away
from your planets,

38:10.497 --> 38:12.998
but not in a matter of seconds.

38:22.342 --> 38:25.594
Listen to your watch, Dr. Marvin.

38:27.514 --> 38:30.849
It's stopped. It's supposed
to be antimagnetic.

38:31.017 --> 38:36.063
We generate a magnetic field stronger
than the gravitational field on your Earth.

38:36.231 --> 38:39.566
This is the principle by which
we move through space.

38:39.734 --> 38:42.528
We have adjusted the magnetic
field to compensate

38:42.696 --> 38:46.657
for the normal loss of gravitational
effect and atmospheric pressure.

38:47.701 --> 38:50.577
But your watch hasn't stopped.

38:50.745 --> 38:53.122
Feel your pulse.

38:56.042 --> 38:57.918
I haven't any.

39:00.213 --> 39:01.547
Neither have I.

39:02.382 --> 39:05.676
We operate in a very
different time reference.

39:05.885 --> 39:07.928
You might say
all this is happening

39:08.096 --> 39:11.849
between the ticks of your watch
or the beats of your heart.

39:12.017 --> 39:16.645
And that's why we couldn't decipher
your message till it was too late.

39:16.813 --> 39:21.316
It made it necessary for us to
defend ourselves at Sky Hook.

39:21.484 --> 39:25.529
Then you shot down
our 11 rockets. Why?

39:25.739 --> 39:30.659
At that time, we had no way of knowing
they were only primitive observation posts.

39:31.369 --> 39:34.788
We thought they might be
weapons directed against us.

39:35.331 --> 39:38.667
Who are you? Where are you from?

39:39.044 --> 39:43.422
Because of your leadership in
exploring the field of outer space,

39:43.631 --> 39:46.008
we felt you could
best understand

39:46.217 --> 39:49.928
that we are the survivors of
a disintegrated solar system.

39:50.680 --> 39:55.726
At this moment, the remainder
of our fleet is circling your globe.

40:12.077 --> 40:15.454
They're awaiting a signal
to tell them where to land.

40:15.663 --> 40:17.039
What do you want with me?

40:17.207 --> 40:22.044
Arrange for your world leaders to
confer with us in the city of Washington.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.838
They may not listen.
I'm only a scientist.

40:25.048 --> 40:29.468
We will show you how important
it is to convince your leaders.

40:29.928 --> 40:32.596
In an instant of
your time, we travel

40:32.806 --> 40:36.975
from beyond your moon to
the surface of your Earth.

40:55.537 --> 40:57.913
There were 300 men on that ship.

41:00.542 --> 41:04.920
Speed, maneuverability and force.

41:05.088 --> 41:08.132
With a weapon like that, why don't
you just land and take over?

41:08.341 --> 41:11.176
To do that would cause
worldwide panic.

41:11.344 --> 41:12.761
Despite our power,

41:12.971 --> 41:15.222
the few of us would
be busy indefinitely

41:15.390 --> 41:18.809
trying to suppress a large,
hostile population.

41:18.977 --> 41:22.729
In the end, we would be masters
of a wrecked and hungry planet.

41:22.939 --> 41:25.357
What makes you think you'll
conquer us without a fight?

41:25.567 --> 41:29.570
We felt it would be best to meet with
you so fighting could be avoided.

41:29.779 --> 41:32.865
Such agreements have been
made on Earth before.

41:33.032 --> 41:34.825
How do you know
so much about us?

41:35.034 --> 41:37.828
We have the means of
accumulating information.

41:38.496 --> 41:43.542
If you wish to convince yourself about
our detailed knowledge, test us.

41:43.710 --> 41:45.794
Any question.

41:46.754 --> 41:49.506
What's the size of the Armed
Forces of the United States?

41:50.049 --> 41:54.386
It is approximately
3 and one half million men.

41:55.638 --> 41:59.641
Well, what team has won
the most World Series?

42:00.226 --> 42:03.312
The New York Yankees.

42:03.605 --> 42:06.273
Who was the first president
of the United States?

42:06.482 --> 42:07.941
Washington.

42:08.109 --> 42:09.902
I know that voice.

42:12.197 --> 42:13.530
Who are you?

42:14.073 --> 42:15.574
John Hanley.

42:17.160 --> 42:21.246
My father. What have
you done to him?

42:21.748 --> 42:26.710
You have been addressing General
Hanley's mind, not General Hanley.

42:26.878 --> 42:28.837
Look behind you.

42:33.384 --> 42:34.676
Dad.

42:34.844 --> 42:37.971
He will not recognize you.
He has been subjected

42:38.181 --> 42:42.476
to a machine we call an
Infinitely Indexed Memory Bank.

42:42.644 --> 42:46.980
We have transferred all knowledge
from his brain to our machine.

42:47.148 --> 42:53.820
Thus, we have available and readily
accessible his total experience.

42:53.988 --> 42:59.117
We can do this to as many as we like
and learn whatever we must know.

42:59.577 --> 43:01.703
Oh, stop it,
please, stop it.

43:01.996 --> 43:03.288
Put that gun away.

43:07.794 --> 43:09.628
Don't look at that.

43:20.098 --> 43:23.767
This is the beginning of the process
by which we read the brain

43:23.935 --> 43:27.312
for the Infinitely Indexed
Memory Bank.

43:32.485 --> 43:34.736
What have you done
with my father?

43:34.904 --> 43:40.450
We will return him to you eventually,
and the police officer too.

43:40.660 --> 43:43.829
Will you arrange
a conference for us?

43:44.038 --> 43:47.666
We will tell the authorities you
want one. That's all we can do.

43:47.834 --> 43:50.002
You're not going to cooperate
with these monsters?

43:50.169 --> 43:52.212
It may take weeks or
months to set it up.

43:52.422 --> 43:56.508
You will have two of your lunar
days, or 56 days Earth time.

43:57.093 --> 43:59.011
Let them kill us now
and be done with it.

43:59.178 --> 44:00.429
Please, Carol.

44:00.596 --> 44:03.640
If our officials don't believe me,
I can't be held responsible.

44:03.850 --> 44:06.476
When you tell of the
destroyer being sunk,

44:06.686 --> 44:09.980
refer to latitude
30 degrees, 20 minutes,

44:10.148 --> 44:13.775
longitude 45 degrees, 15 minutes.

44:13.943 --> 44:16.153
They will believe you.

44:26.456 --> 44:29.583
Well, suppose Major Huglin,
my wife, myself were all hysterical,

44:29.751 --> 44:31.626
or hypnotized, or whatever
you're thinking,

44:31.836 --> 44:36.006
that we never saw what these fiends did
to General Hanley or the police officer.

44:36.174 --> 44:37.799
How do you explain the destroyer?

44:38.009 --> 44:41.345
There's word that the Atlantic fleet has
lost contact with a vessel in the area,

44:41.512 --> 44:44.973
but there's no confirmation of a sinking.
However, we're continuing to check.

44:45.141 --> 44:49.436
You realize, of course, your contacting the saucer
in the first place violated our instructions.

44:49.645 --> 44:52.773
This itself may have placed the safety
of the entire country in jeopardy.

44:53.900 --> 44:57.361
Now that the damage is done, and
assuming your story is verified,

44:57.528 --> 45:00.864
are you proposing that we meet
with these...? These creatures,

45:01.032 --> 45:02.449
and yield to
their demands?

45:02.617 --> 45:03.658
And why Washington?

45:04.202 --> 45:07.621
If they want to parley with the whole world, why
do they choose the capital of the United States?

45:08.664 --> 45:12.501
They appear to be realists, and Washington
is one of the centres of political power.

45:13.002 --> 45:15.253
What about our atomic
and hydrogen weapons?

45:15.421 --> 45:17.214
Wouldn't they be effective
against these saucers?

45:17.423 --> 45:20.008
I'd like to answer that
question, sir, if I may.

45:20.176 --> 45:23.637
Our atomic weapons might be
effective, if we could deliver them.

45:23.846 --> 45:27.724
But to use nuclear power when they
land would destroy our own cities.

45:27.892 --> 45:31.436
And then we don't know whether
they are vulnerable or not.

45:33.523 --> 45:38.652
In answer to your question, Mr. Cassidy, I've
learned a little about their mode of operation

45:38.820 --> 45:42.072
and I've got an idea for
a new kind of weapon.

45:42.240 --> 45:44.282
It's only a guess,
of course.

45:44.492 --> 45:47.077
A new weapon in
less than 56 days?

45:47.703 --> 45:50.247
I have an idea for
an ultrasonic gun.

45:50.415 --> 45:52.332
With enough scientific
and engineering help,

45:52.500 --> 45:55.419
we could construct a working
model in a very short time.

45:55.586 --> 45:57.671
Maybe it will work. If not,
we'll know soon enough.

45:57.839 --> 46:00.549
And in the meantime, you'll be working
on every other means of defense.

46:00.716 --> 46:04.094
We have no choice but to use every
conceivable weapon if they land.

46:04.262 --> 46:05.679
Gentlemen, please.

46:06.639 --> 46:10.267
"The destroyer Franklin Edison was
sunk at latitude 30 degrees, 20 minutes,

46:10.435 --> 46:15.230
longitude 45 degrees, 15 minutes
at approximately 0600."

46:19.193 --> 46:22.946
We are expected at the White House
in an hour for a policy decision

46:23.114 --> 46:26.700
that will probably involve not only
our own country but the entire world.

46:26.909 --> 46:28.076
Whatever the decisions,

46:28.244 --> 46:31.121
you may be certain that you'll be given
every assistance in testing your theory.

46:31.289 --> 46:33.707
I suggest you start
to work right away.

46:33.875 --> 46:36.877
Major Huglin will make arrangements
for whatever facilities you may require.

46:37.044 --> 46:38.795
Thank you.

46:55.980 --> 46:58.064
Hello.
Hi.

46:58.232 --> 46:59.733
How's it going?

46:59.901 --> 47:03.737
Well, instead of turning electric
impulses into ultrahigh-frequency sound,

47:03.905 --> 47:06.031
we nearly burned the place
up about an hour ago.

47:06.199 --> 47:07.616
What?

47:09.160 --> 47:12.037
All right, let's try it
out on the cement block.

47:26.302 --> 47:28.220
All the way.

47:34.519 --> 47:36.186
Well, there goes your generator.

47:37.146 --> 47:38.980
But it worked, Russ.
It worked, didn't it?

47:39.148 --> 47:40.524
We know what
hit Sky Hook.

47:40.691 --> 47:41.858
What?
Sound.

47:42.026 --> 47:43.109
Sound? Ha-ha.

47:43.277 --> 47:46.780
Having two small boys around the house, I
know that noise doesn't do a man much good,

47:46.948 --> 47:49.115
but burn him up,
knock his house down?

47:49.283 --> 47:53.537
The sound I had in mind was of a higher wave
frequency than we've ever been able to produce.

47:53.704 --> 47:55.789
Then you mean we've
got the weapon?

47:55.957 --> 47:58.375
No, I'm afraid not.

47:58.543 --> 48:00.961
With the best materials
and circuits available,

48:01.128 --> 48:04.631
all we've succeeded in doing is
pulverizing the end of a cement block.

48:04.799 --> 48:06.550
The theory is beautiful.

48:06.717 --> 48:09.594
We don't have the tools and
the materials to make it work.

48:09.804 --> 48:13.223
Maybe in 10 years,
five, even two.

48:13.432 --> 48:15.976
How many days left?
Twenty-seven.

48:16.185 --> 48:20.480
Russ, remember that report
from Dr. Patek in New Delhi?

48:20.648 --> 48:22.983
He suggested a
different approach.

48:23.150 --> 48:27.612
Instead of attempting to duplicate
the ultrasonic devices of our visitors,

48:27.780 --> 48:30.657
we try to interrupt
their magnetic field

48:30.866 --> 48:34.452
by projecting a highly intermittent
induced electrical field.

48:34.662 --> 48:36.871
Now, suppose we take...
Of course!

48:37.039 --> 48:41.876
We cut the ultrasonic wavelength into the
circuit and knock them down like clay pigeons.

48:42.044 --> 48:44.921
Not so fast, Russ...
It can work. It can work.

48:45.089 --> 48:47.007
Here, major, get on the phone.
Yes?

48:47.174 --> 48:51.428
We'll need the largest portable
generator that Schenectady makes.

48:52.930 --> 48:55.432
From all parts of
the globe, under top priority,

48:55.600 --> 48:57.809
came every facility
and scientific help

48:57.977 --> 48:59.936
the governments of
the world could furnish.

49:00.104 --> 49:04.899
Dr. Marvin and his staff assembled these
necessary materials in a concealed laboratory,

49:05.109 --> 49:10.196
where they were to translate a short
experience in a craft from outer space

49:10.364 --> 49:13.325
into a formula, then plans,

49:13.492 --> 49:17.120
and, finally, a functioning reality.

49:17.288 --> 49:19.205
It's only a hollow steel ball,

49:19.373 --> 49:22.709
but for our purposes
it's a flying saucer.

49:24.003 --> 49:26.880
You can start up
the generator now.

49:36.891 --> 49:38.725
The magnet does that,
doesn't it?

49:38.893 --> 49:43.980
The magnetic attraction above is enough to
counteract the pull of gravity from below.

49:49.236 --> 49:51.863
Go ahead, it was your idea.
You be the first to try it.

49:52.031 --> 49:53.365
My idea?
Nonsense.

49:53.532 --> 49:57.661
It was just as much yours, and Dr. Patek's in India,
and a dozen other scientists' all over the world.

49:57.828 --> 49:59.621
Come on.

50:13.511 --> 50:15.804
It works.
It works fine.

50:17.348 --> 50:18.848
Russ, look.

51:00.766 --> 51:02.225
What was it?

51:02.393 --> 51:05.353
The same kind of thing that's watched
us since the beginning of the project.

51:05.521 --> 51:06.646
Watched who?

51:06.814 --> 51:09.357
Russ and all the developments
of the rocket program.

51:09.525 --> 51:11.568
I always thought it
was St. Elmo's Fire.

51:11.736 --> 51:13.778
I'll have to change
my mind about that.

51:13.946 --> 51:17.657
Whatever it was, the saucers sent
it down to find out what we're doing.

51:17.825 --> 51:18.867
We have
television.

51:19.034 --> 51:22.495
They may have some totally different
device that serves the same purpose.

51:22.663 --> 51:25.623
We'd better get to Washington
before they decide to drop in on us.

51:25.791 --> 51:28.084
Major, give Cutting a hand and load
that gun on the generator truck.

51:28.252 --> 51:29.294
Right.

51:29.462 --> 51:33.006
Never mind the files, professor.
I'll take the diagrams.

51:35.801 --> 51:38.303
We ought to be in Washington
in about an hour.

51:42.600 --> 51:45.059
I hope they haven't
spotted us.

51:45.227 --> 51:48.021
Let's pull away from
the lab. Come on.

52:16.717 --> 52:19.135
If that saucer stays
in firing range,

52:19.303 --> 52:22.722
we may be able to give
the gun its first real test.

52:34.985 --> 52:37.237
Saucer landing
near Belmont Lab.

52:37.404 --> 52:40.240
Major Huglin calling for
aerial protection. Over.

52:44.537 --> 52:46.579
They're sending
a bomber.

52:46.747 --> 52:49.249
We ought to go on with those
diagrams as quickly as we can.

52:49.416 --> 52:52.293
I'll get them from Russ.
I'll go with you.

52:54.171 --> 52:58.132
Fire up the generator. We're
gonna see if this gun really works.

53:05.474 --> 53:08.726
What's the matter?
I can't get this blasted thing started.

53:12.231 --> 53:14.274
They're looking
for us, all right.

53:29.790 --> 53:33.376
Russ, getting you and the plans to Washington
is more important than anything else.

53:33.544 --> 53:34.711
She's right.

53:34.879 --> 53:38.548
She's right, if this machine works.
If not, it doesn't make any difference.

54:03.991 --> 54:07.660
It works. If we just had
a little more power.

54:17.046 --> 54:19.756
Russ, let's go, please.
Before it's too late.

55:19.108 --> 55:23.403
Keep the gun circling overhead
and the saucer will stay away.

56:15.039 --> 56:17.081
Russ, be careful.

56:17.624 --> 56:19.792
I think it's dead.

56:24.882 --> 56:27.300
It's light as a feather.

56:41.023 --> 56:43.316
Humanoid, and ancient.

56:43.525 --> 56:47.570
These suits must serve as an
electronic and mechanical outer skin

56:47.738 --> 56:51.282
to take the place of their
atrophied flesh and muscles.

57:02.461 --> 57:04.170
I must get this to a lab.

58:54.156 --> 58:57.033
Don't go out there.
Don't go out there.

59:31.276 --> 59:34.779
Oh. Here are Dr.
And Mrs. Marvin now.

59:36.990 --> 59:39.116
Carol. Russ. We've
been waiting for you.

59:39.284 --> 59:40.326
Thanks.

59:40.494 --> 59:41.953
This is Dr. Alberts.
How do you do?

59:42.120 --> 59:44.497
You know General
Edmunds, Admiral Enright.

59:44.665 --> 59:45.957
Certainly.

59:46.124 --> 59:48.042
And Mrs. Marvin is
General Hanley's daughter.

59:48.210 --> 59:49.252
Mrs. Marvin.

59:49.419 --> 59:51.295
Your father's death was
a great loss to all of us.

59:51.463 --> 59:52.630
Thank you.

59:52.798 --> 59:54.382
Well, I see you've
been busy.

59:54.549 --> 59:56.467
Oh, we've been
doing a little work.

59:56.635 --> 01:00:00.972
Here, let me show you. It didn't take
too long to break this thing down.

01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:04.976
These helmets have a
language-translating device in them.

01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:10.439
Mrs. Marvin, would you say
something into the microphone?

01:00:14.403 --> 01:00:16.445
The quality of mercy
Is not strained

01:00:22.744 --> 01:00:24.954
It droppeth as the gentle
Rain from heaven

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:30.084
Shakespeare
wouldn't like it.

01:00:31.586 --> 01:00:35.506
Professor Alberts said if we read the
dictionary into the device, word by word,

01:00:35.674 --> 01:00:38.301
we'd have a translation of those
words into their language.

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:42.388
By translating their communications into
our words, we were able to decode them.

01:00:42.556 --> 01:00:47.059
Professor Alberts requisitioned the electronic
translator which his university had developed,

01:00:47.227 --> 01:00:49.395
and the results, to say the
least, have been startling.

01:00:50.063 --> 01:00:52.940
We've recorded a number
of their messages on tape.

01:00:53.108 --> 01:00:55.901
One of the messages appears
to be a plan of attack.

01:00:56.111 --> 01:00:58.654
The rest
were operational routine.

01:00:58.864 --> 01:01:00.114
I'll show you how it worked.

01:01:00.282 --> 01:01:01.782
Over here.

01:01:44.785 --> 01:01:48.496
"We can expect trouble when
Mercury is in perihelion. "

01:01:48.663 --> 01:01:50.122
When will that be?

01:01:50.332 --> 01:01:52.708
It happens twice
every three months.

01:01:52.876 --> 01:01:55.461
The information is too vague
to be of any use to us.

01:01:56.588 --> 01:01:58.172
And "the sun in
con Polaris"?

01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.216
That implies an
orbital relation

01:02:00.384 --> 01:02:02.426
between the star
Polaris and the sun.

01:02:02.594 --> 01:02:04.261
We've never been
able to figure it out.

01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:08.766
The blanks probably refer
to their time computation.

01:02:08.934 --> 01:02:11.102
But these messages
do involve the sun?

01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:14.105
Panama and the other observatories
are watching it around the clock.

01:02:14.314 --> 01:02:16.607
In the meantime, we have a
newer and stronger version

01:02:16.775 --> 01:02:19.276
of our interference machine on
the drawing boards at Aberdeen.

01:02:19.486 --> 01:02:22.822
Has there been any determination
of the weapon's useful range?

01:02:23.031 --> 01:02:24.824
There's a weakness.

01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:29.995
Our instruments indicate that the potential
effect drops off sharply after 1500 yards.

01:02:30.872 --> 01:02:33.666
We'll have to hope
that that's enough.

01:02:33.834 --> 01:02:36.669
Well, maybe we'll be ready
for them when they come.

01:02:36.837 --> 01:02:38.963
Has anyone tried
that helmet on?

01:02:39.131 --> 01:02:43.717
Yes, we have. I think
you'd be interested. Try it.

01:02:46.304 --> 01:02:48.973
It weighs only
a few grams.

01:02:49.224 --> 01:02:52.017
What's it made of?
We don't know exactly.

01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:56.897
Solidified electricity is the fancy name
given to it by the Bureau of Standards.

01:02:57.065 --> 01:03:01.861
It resists everything we used on it,
including the most extreme temperatures.

01:03:07.159 --> 01:03:09.368
It makes me Superman,
for one thing.

01:03:09.536 --> 01:03:10.786
Yes, we know.

01:03:11.663 --> 01:03:13.706
I have a peculiar
range of vision.

01:03:20.505 --> 01:03:23.257
I can also hear a young man
just outside that window,

01:03:23.425 --> 01:03:25.551
discussing a problem
in advanced biology.

01:03:26.761 --> 01:03:29.388
Carol, would you
see if I'm right?

01:03:31.099 --> 01:03:34.602
When I kissed her good night,
she slapped my face. I said:

01:03:34.853 --> 01:03:38.772
"I didn't slap yours when you
ordered a $4 steak for dinner. "

01:03:40.066 --> 01:03:42.485
You know, just as we need
glasses and hearing aids,

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:45.779
these people need electronic
amplification of all their senses,

01:03:45.947 --> 01:03:48.032
especially sight
and hearing.

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:49.950
Does that suggest
anything to you?

01:03:50.118 --> 01:03:52.828
They have their
weaknesses.

01:03:53.038 --> 01:03:54.121
When will we
be ready?

01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:55.956
We'll need at least
a couple of weeks.

01:03:56.124 --> 01:03:58.918
People of Earth, attention.

01:03:59.085 --> 01:04:02.713
People of Earth, attention.

01:04:02.923 --> 01:04:08.302
This is a voice speaking to you from
thousands of miles beyond your planet.

01:04:08.637 --> 01:04:11.764
This is a voice speaking to you
Stop that.

01:04:11.932 --> 01:04:15.184
From thousands of miles
beyond your planet.

01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:22.316
Look to your sun for a warning.

01:04:22.484 --> 01:04:26.654
Following eruptions on your sun,
there will be eight days and nights

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:28.906
of meteorological convulsions...

01:04:29.074 --> 01:04:30.574
Turn it down.

01:04:30.742 --> 01:04:33.744
They're arrogant enough, announcing
their schedule in advance.

01:04:33.912 --> 01:04:36.872
They're coming down to take over, they
made that clear to us in the saucer.

01:04:37.082 --> 01:04:40.459
They can move so fast and strike so hard, they
ought to be able to sneak in and flatten us.

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:44.588
They expect to terrify us
with a display of power.

01:04:44.756 --> 01:04:48.008
They're contemptuous
of our defenses.

01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:55.683
If I'm right, they'll sail into
Washington in broad daylight

01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:59.061
and expect us to capitulate
when they land.

01:05:01.439 --> 01:05:04.692
People of Earth, attention.

01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:07.653
People of Earth, attention.

01:05:08.363 --> 01:05:20.791
This is a voice speaking to you from
thousands of miles beyond your planet.

01:05:20.959 --> 01:05:25.796
Look to your sun for a warning.
Look to your sun for a warning.

01:05:25.964 --> 01:05:28.048
It's coming over
everywhere.

01:05:28.258 --> 01:05:30.718
Following eruptions on your sun,

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:35.055
there will be eight days and nights
of meteorological convulsions.

01:05:35.223 --> 01:05:36.557
Soon thereafter...

01:05:36.725 --> 01:05:40.227
They'll panic and
immobilise the whole country.

01:05:40.395 --> 01:05:41.770
The whole world.

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:46.358
Let all nations be represented
in Washington to confer with us...

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:10.758
People of Earth, attention.

01:06:10.925 --> 01:06:12.968
In every country of
the world, in every language,

01:06:13.136 --> 01:06:16.597
every means of electronic communication
was jammed with the message.

01:06:16.931 --> 01:06:19.933
The warning was dinned into
the ears of the Earth's population

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:22.227
unceasingly for 12 hours.

01:06:22.395 --> 01:06:26.023
And after the 12th hour, silence.

01:06:26.733 --> 01:06:32.488
Then, a tremendous explosion
on the surface of the sun.

01:06:36.951 --> 01:06:38.869
"Nine days. "

01:06:39.037 --> 01:06:41.705
That must be what
the missing words meant.

01:06:41.873 --> 01:06:43.540
I get the picture. Thanks.

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:47.753
If I need any more information,
I'll call you back. Goodbye.

01:06:48.755 --> 01:06:50.881
That was the Bureau of Meteorology.

01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:54.510
As we know, sunspots have a
direct effect upon our weather.

01:06:54.678 --> 01:06:57.554
We can expect heavy storms,
tidal waves, hurricanes.

01:06:57.722 --> 01:06:58.764
When?

01:06:58.932 --> 01:07:00.849
Beginning now and
continuing for eight days.

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:04.019
Just when we most need our
communications and transport.

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:07.314
We'll have to work under the worst possible
conditions to prepare for an attack.

01:07:07.482 --> 01:07:08.982
What's the schedule,
general?

01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:11.527
You're working on the installation
of the interference units.

01:07:11.695 --> 01:07:14.613
Our plans for evacuating the city
are already underway.

01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:16.824
Then it's been decided
that we'll fight?

01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:19.368
When an armed and threatening power
lands uninvited in our capital,

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:21.704
we don't meet them
with tea and cookies.

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:24.206
There's the job of production
expediting waiting for me.

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:26.834
I don't believe further
discussion would solve our problem.

01:07:27.001 --> 01:07:31.839
Before we break up, I remind
you that we have nine days left.

01:07:32.006 --> 01:07:34.883
One of those days
is already half gone.

01:07:53.445 --> 01:07:55.821
What a nice
going-away present.

01:07:55.989 --> 01:07:59.366
You might call it that.
Is my bag packed?

01:07:59.534 --> 01:08:02.828
Mm-hm. Mine too.
What time do we leave?

01:08:02.996 --> 01:08:04.496
I have to leave right now.

01:08:04.706 --> 01:08:07.708
I'm going to Aberdeen to
supervise the interference project.

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:12.212
So that wasn't a hello kiss
at all. It was goodbye.

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:13.881
For a little while.

01:08:14.048 --> 01:08:18.051
You're gonna have to leave town.
They're evacuating Washington.

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:21.596
Where am I going?
Palm Springs.

01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:23.765
Remember the place
I told you about?

01:08:24.017 --> 01:08:25.517
Mm-hm.

01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:28.979
We were going there together.
I know.

01:08:29.981 --> 01:08:32.441
Your plane leaves tonight.

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:35.611
Russ, let me stay.
Maybe I can help.

01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:40.783
There's nothing more you
can do. Here's your ticket.

01:08:41.326 --> 01:08:44.745
You'll arrive before
the bad weather sets in.

01:08:45.078 --> 01:08:47.206
And I'll be there soon.

01:09:08.435 --> 01:09:11.522
The first of man's
vital communications to suffer

01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:15.943
were the shipping lanes
and airways.

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:21.156
Then transport by rail
and highway ground to a halt.

01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:24.493
When the telephone
and telegraph systems had failed

01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:28.997
and the radio networks were forced to
bear the burden alone, they, too, succumbed

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:34.044
to interference known to originate in
an increasing disturbance in the sun.

01:09:34.212 --> 01:09:37.631
The world, crippled
by these events,

01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:43.011
waited for the first sign of
an invasion from outer space.

01:09:43.805 --> 01:09:47.432
Because of the atmospheric violence,
it was not until the ninth day

01:09:47.642 --> 01:09:51.353
that an orderly evacuation of the city
of Washington could be attempted.

01:09:51.563 --> 01:09:54.898
Although the authorities and
the military worked miracles,

01:09:55.108 --> 01:09:56.984
when the 10th day dawned,

01:09:57.151 --> 01:09:59.945
more than 60 percent of
the people of Washington

01:10:00.113 --> 01:10:02.739
were still in the
metropolitan area.

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:05.325
Take these to CIC.
Yes, sir.

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:09.121
Mrs. Marvin.

01:10:10.707 --> 01:10:13.250
Your husband told me you
were in Palm Springs.

01:10:13.418 --> 01:10:16.086
The plane schedules were
canceled before I could get away.

01:10:16.254 --> 01:10:17.754
Have you heard
from Russ?

01:10:17.922 --> 01:10:21.884
There's been practically no communication
with Aberdeen. Wires are down, radio jammed.

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:23.385
But I'm expecting
a courier any minute.

01:10:29.475 --> 01:10:30.726
A red alert.

01:11:14.604 --> 01:11:18.023
Saucer heading in low
over the Atlantic, coming in fast.

01:12:02.527 --> 01:12:06.947
They're breaking through our
defenses. Ground all aircraft.

01:12:07.573 --> 01:12:11.201
They'll be overhead any minute.
You better get down to the shelter.

01:12:14.956 --> 01:12:17.249
Wait a moment, Mrs. Marvin.

01:12:18.876 --> 01:12:21.420
Truck convoys from Aberdeen are
taking up positions in the city.

01:12:21.629 --> 01:12:23.714
Your husband's section
is nearing the Pentagon.

01:12:23.881 --> 01:12:25.298
Thanks.

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:27.319
Mobile unit calling GHQ. Saucer
hit and down in the Potomac.

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:48.799
Keep it in your field
so it can't fire at us.

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:40.016
Fire at the saucer
until it crashes.

01:14:40.184 --> 01:14:43.019
Russ. Russ.

01:14:45.898 --> 01:14:47.399
Carol, I thought
you'd gone to...

01:14:47.567 --> 01:14:49.317
GHQ calling all HF units.

01:14:49.527 --> 01:14:51.403
GHQ calling all HF units.

01:14:51.571 --> 01:14:54.322
Saucer hovering vicinity
White House and Capitol.

01:15:31.152 --> 01:15:34.779
Attention, all units. Saucer now landing
vicinity White House. Attention, all units...

01:15:36.324 --> 01:15:37.741
Sounds like
they're jamming us.

01:20:01.464 --> 01:20:04.591
Dr. Marvin. Dr. Marvin,
we've made contact with GHQ.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.718
GHQ to all HF units.

01:20:06.886 --> 01:20:09.721
Attention. Saucer has landed
in front of Capitol building.

01:20:09.889 --> 01:20:14.851
All HF units, attention.
GHQ to all HF units.

01:21:00.981 --> 01:21:02.607
Keep firing at saucers.

01:21:53.117 --> 01:21:55.410
The present danger is ended.

01:21:55.578 --> 01:22:08.172
The present danger is ended.

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:11.593
All units report to your commanders
for further orders.

01:22:15.222 --> 01:22:17.849
The present danger is ended.

01:22:24.189 --> 01:22:27.734
Don't wiggle.
Here's what it says:

01:22:27.943 --> 01:22:30.737
"The president has ordered
Project Sky Hook rebuilt,

01:22:30.904 --> 01:22:33.406
and the space exploration
program continued

01:22:33.574 --> 01:22:36.284
under the direction of
Dr. Russell A. Marvin.

01:22:36.452 --> 01:22:41.748
The United Nations assembly voted unanimously
today to award a gold medal to Dr. Marvin. "

01:22:41.915 --> 01:22:45.084
And to Mrs. Marvin goes a
gold medal from Dr. Marvin

01:22:45.252 --> 01:22:50.381
for her love, courage, devotion,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

01:22:54.219 --> 01:22:58.014
Russ, do you think
there are any more?

01:22:58.182 --> 01:23:00.433
Will they come back again?

01:23:00.601 --> 01:23:03.519
Not on such a nice day.

01:23:12.237 --> 01:23:14.614
And not to such a nice world.

01:23:14.782 --> 01:23:18.743
I'm glad it's still here.
And still ours.
