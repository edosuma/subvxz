WEBVTT

00:09.467 --> 00:11.833
- FRANKIE, YOU'RE STARRING
IN YOUR SCHOOL PLAY.

00:11.867 --> 00:13.433
AREN'T YOU NERVOUS?

00:13.467 --> 00:15.633
- NO, BECAUSE MOM HERE'S
A GREAT DIRECTOR.

00:15.667 --> 00:17.367
AND UNLIKE MOST
OF MY COMPLIMENTS,

00:17.400 --> 00:20.133
I DON'T EVEN MEAN THAT
SARCASTICALLY.

00:20.167 --> 00:21.467
- AWW.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.167
- BACK IN NEW YORK,
I WROTE AND DIRECTED

00:23.200 --> 00:25.567
SEVERAL
OF FRANKIE'S SCHOOL PLAYS.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.333
I GUESS
I WAS THE OBVIOUS CHOICE

00:27.367 --> 00:29.333
HAVING GROWN UP
IN THE THEATER.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.333
- NO, I LIVED IN A THEATER.

00:33.367 --> 00:36.100
DAD THOUGHT HE COULD CONVERT IT
TO A COOL HOUSE.

00:36.133 --> 00:37.833
HE COULD NOT.

00:37.867 --> 00:40.167
BUT WE WERE THRILLED
WHEN FRANKIE'S NEW SCHOOL

00:40.200 --> 00:44.100
AGREED TO DO MY LATEST WORK,
MONSTERS IN YOUR MOUTH.

00:44.133 --> 00:45.667
- WELL, I'M NOT EXACTLY
INTO HORROR,

00:45.700 --> 00:48.733
BUT I THINK FRANKIE'S GONNA
MAKE A GREAT MUMMY.

00:48.767 --> 00:51.400
- OH, SHE'S NOT A MUMMY.
IT'S A PLAY ABOUT ORAL HYGIENE.

00:51.433 --> 00:52.767
MEET DETECTIVE DENTAL FLOSS,

00:52.800 --> 00:55.567
THE NUMBER ONE CAVITY COP
ON THE FORCE.

00:55.600 --> 00:57.567
- HEY, COOL MUMMY COSTUME.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.367
- SHE'S NOT A MUMMY.
IT'S A PLAY ABOUT ORAL--

00:59.400 --> 01:01.733
AH, NEVER MIND.

01:01.767 --> 01:03.767
HEY, TAYLOR,
CAN I COUNT ON YOU AND MILES

01:03.800 --> 01:05.700
TO HELP OUT IN THE BAKERY
WHILE I WORK ON THE PLAY?

01:05.733 --> 01:07.567
- YOU'RE MY MOTHER.
OF COURSE I'D LOVE TO HELP.

01:07.600 --> 01:08.767
- AW.

01:08.800 --> 01:09.800
- I GET TO KEEP
ALL THE TIPS, RIGHT?

01:09.833 --> 01:12.100
TAY NEEDS A NEW PAIR OF BOOTS.

01:12.133 --> 01:13.200
- THAT'S MY GIRL.

01:13.233 --> 01:14.300
- SPEAKING OF TIPS,

01:14.333 --> 01:15.667
I'VE GOT A LIST OF IDEAS

01:15.700 --> 01:16.733
WHICH I REALLY THINK
COULD BOOST BUSINESS.

01:16.767 --> 01:18.233
- HMM.
- DRINK THIS IN--

01:18.267 --> 01:21.300
BANANA BREAD.

01:21.333 --> 01:23.800
- YEAH.

01:23.833 --> 01:26.600
SO OUR NEW BAKER CLEM
WILL BE THERE TO SUPERVISE

01:26.633 --> 01:27.867
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

01:27.900 --> 01:32.567
AS FOR ME,
IT IS BACK TO THE REWRITE.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.100
AH, THE PEN.

01:34.133 --> 01:36.800
MY GREATEST ENEMY,

01:36.833 --> 01:39.100
MY DEAREST FRIEND.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.800
THIS IS SO FUN!

01:40.833 --> 01:44.300
- I'M SO LOVING THIS.

01:44.333 --> 01:46.233
I'M SO HATING THIS.

01:46.267 --> 01:47.533
- BUT YOU JUST SAID YOU--

01:47.567 --> 01:50.500
- I'M AN ACTOR, MILES.
TRY TO KEEP UP.

01:50.533 --> 01:52.167
- I THOUGHT YOU LIKED DOING
MOM'S PLAYS.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.600
- I TOLERATE THEM
BECAUSE IT MAKES HER HAPPY.

01:54.633 --> 01:58.367
BUT...HOW DO I PUT THIS
IN A NICE WAY?

01:58.400 --> 02:01.200
THIS PLAY IS GARBAGE!

02:01.233 --> 02:04.267
I'M GOING TO HUMILIATE MYSELF
IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL.

02:04.300 --> 02:06.333
- WELL, YOU CAN'T QUIT.
IT'D BREAK HER HEART.

02:06.367 --> 02:09.167
- LOOK, JUST TELL MICHELLE
HOW YOU HONESTLY FEEL.

02:09.200 --> 02:10.167
SHE'LL UNDERSTAND.

02:10.200 --> 02:11.667
- YES, MILES.

02:11.700 --> 02:14.100
THAT'D CERTAINLY BE
THE HONORABLE THING TO DO.

02:14.133 --> 02:15.700
- YOU'RE GONNA FAKE AN INJURY.

02:15.733 --> 02:17.333
AREN'T YOU?
- OH, YEAH.

02:17.367 --> 02:19.700
OH, MY TOE.

02:21.133 --> 02:23.600
THE PAIN.
- WAIT A MINUTE.

02:23.633 --> 02:26.200
YOU HURT YOUR TOE
WHEN YOU MISSED MY POETRY SLAM.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.700
- THAT TIME WAS REAL.

02:27.733 --> 02:29.233
- OH.

02:35.333 --> 02:38.133
- * IF YOU MOVE
INTO A HAUNTED HOUSE *

02:38.167 --> 02:40.800
* YOU GOTTA TRY
TO WORK THINGS OUT *

02:40.833 --> 02:43.100
- * SO IF YOU'RE LIVING
WITH A GHOST OR THREE *

02:43.133 --> 02:46.867
- * YOU GOTTA BE
ONE BIG, SEMI-SCARY FAMILY *

02:46.900 --> 02:49.300
- * DON'T KNOW
HOW WE ENDED UP THIS WAY *

02:49.333 --> 02:50.733
- * BUT I GUESS
YOU COULD CALL US *

02:50.767 --> 02:53.600
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:53.633 --> 02:56.467
* THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:56.500 --> 02:58.533
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:58.567 --> 03:02.367
*

03:02.400 --> 03:04.400
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

03:04.433 --> 03:06.500
*

03:09.467 --> 03:11.200
- OH, YEAH.

03:11.233 --> 03:12.467
PONIES VS. ROBOTS 4!

03:12.500 --> 03:14.667
THIS IS
THE SICKEST VIDEO GAME EVER.

03:14.700 --> 03:18.633
GIDDYUP, DAFFODIL.

03:18.667 --> 03:20.267
- WHOA.
COOL LASERS.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.767
I WANT TO PLAY.

03:22.800 --> 03:25.367
- OKAY, "A," NOT HAPPENING.

03:25.400 --> 03:28.400
"B..."

03:28.433 --> 03:30.367
- WHAT, ARE YOU AFRAID
I'M GONNA WIPE OUT

03:30.400 --> 03:32.100
ALL YOUR HIGH SCORES AGAIN?

03:32.133 --> 03:34.333
- I FEAR NO FEMALE.

03:34.367 --> 03:36.267
AAH!

03:37.533 --> 03:39.300
- RAY, THANKS SO MUCH
FOR VOLUNTEERING

03:39.333 --> 03:41.533
TO WRITE A MUSICAL NUMBER
FOR MONSTERS IN YOUR MOUTH.

03:41.567 --> 03:44.233
DANKE.
- HAPPY TO HELP.

03:44.267 --> 03:46.800
AS A PROFESSIONAL MUSICIAN,
IT SHOULDN'T BE HARD.

03:46.833 --> 03:48.333
- AND AS A PROFESSIONAL,

03:48.367 --> 03:49.700
YOU'RE USED TO GETTING NOTES,
RIGHT?

03:49.733 --> 03:51.433
- I SUPPOSE I--
- GOOD.

03:51.467 --> 03:52.733
YOUR MUSIC TENDS
TO BE MORE...

03:52.767 --> 03:54.567
* SKOODILY DOODILY
BOP BOP BOP *

03:54.600 --> 03:56.333
I NEED
A MORE BROADWAY SOUND, LIKE,

03:56.367 --> 03:58.133
* I'M WALKIN',
I'M TALKIN' *

03:58.167 --> 04:01.300
* AND I'M SINGIN' MY SONG

04:01.333 --> 04:05.600
- YEAH, 'CAUSE SKOODILY DOO
SOUNDS STUPID.

04:07.633 --> 04:11.300
- I'LL BE FINE.
WELL, TIME TO REHEARSE.

04:11.333 --> 04:15.767
AAH!
SEARING, UNDENIABLE PAIN!

04:15.800 --> 04:17.200
- OH, NO,
YOU DON'T.

04:17.233 --> 04:19.200
YOU'RE HURT.
NO PLAY FOR YOU.

04:19.233 --> 04:21.667
- BUT I MADE A COMMITMENT
TO THE THEATER.

04:21.700 --> 04:23.267
- MM, SORRY.

04:23.300 --> 04:24.800
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO FIND
A REPLACEMENT MUMMY.

04:24.833 --> 04:26.700
- DETECTIVE.
- I KNEW THAT.

04:26.733 --> 04:28.833
[lasers shooting
on video game]

04:28.867 --> 04:31.200
- RAY, REMEMBER
WHEN YOU SAID YOU WISHED

04:31.233 --> 04:32.867
YOU COULD GET LOUIE
OUT OF THE HOUSE AND AWAY

04:32.900 --> 04:34.467
FROM ALL HIS VIDEO GAMES?

04:34.500 --> 04:36.800
- I DON'T REMEMBER SAYING--
- WELL, YOU DID.

04:36.833 --> 04:38.333
AND I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA
FOR LOUIE

04:38.367 --> 04:39.467
TO REPLACE ME IN THE PLAY.

04:42.300 --> 04:44.800
- HE'S HEARD ME RUN LINES,
SO HE KNOWS THE DIALOGUE.

04:44.833 --> 04:46.400
YOU'RE A GENIUS, RAY.

04:46.433 --> 04:47.700
- HE HAS BEEN PLAYING

04:47.733 --> 04:50.067
A LOT OF PONIES VS. ROBOTS
LATELY.

04:50.067 --> 04:52.733
- BUT PEOPLE CAN'T SEE LOUIE.
HE'S A GHOST.

04:52.767 --> 04:54.800
- HE CAN POSSESS
THE COSTUME.

04:54.833 --> 04:57.600
AND GHOSTS CAN PROJECT THEIR
VOICES WHENEVER WE WANT TO.

04:57.633 --> 04:59.533
- I'D LIKE TO BE HEARD
RIGHT NOW.

04:59.567 --> 05:03.133
I DON'T WANNA!

05:03.167 --> 05:05.333
- DIRECTING A GHOST
WOULD BE A CHALLENGE.

05:05.367 --> 05:08.300
AND THEATER IS
ALL ABOUT MEETING CHALLENGES.

05:08.333 --> 05:11.133
I'LL DO IT!

05:11.167 --> 05:14.133
- BUT THE PONIES
AND THE ROBOTS!

05:14.167 --> 05:16.233
- HAVE FUN.

05:22.167 --> 05:24.867
- MILES, YOUR "MUFFIN
ON A STICK" IDEA IS KILLING IT.

05:24.900 --> 05:27.133
I'VE ALREADY GOT TWICE
AS MANY TIPS AS USUAL.

05:27.167 --> 05:28.500
YOU ARE BRILLIANT.

05:28.533 --> 05:30.100
- AW, THANKS, TAYLOR.

05:30.133 --> 05:31.600
I'VE GOT A WHOLE BINDER
FULL OF IDEAS.

05:31.633 --> 05:32.867
WANT TO HEAR MY NEXT ONE?
- SURE!

05:32.900 --> 05:35.100
- TUCK IN YOUR SHIRT.

05:36.367 --> 05:38.100
- APPEARANCES ARE IMPORTANT

05:38.133 --> 05:39.767
TO THE SUCCESS
OF A BUSINESS.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.767
THE WAY YOU LOOK REFLECTS
ON ALL OF US.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.367
- OH. OKAY.

05:43.400 --> 05:46.267
- OH, AND THE HAIRNET
I LEFT OUT FOR YOU?

05:46.300 --> 05:48.367
TAKE A HINT.

05:48.400 --> 05:51.167
- ALL RIGHT, MILES.
SLOW DOWN.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.467
YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS HERE.

05:52.500 --> 05:55.067
CLEM IS.
- HEY, YO, TAYLOR.

05:55.067 --> 05:58.633
FYI, I'M GONNA BE IN THE KITCHEN
TRYING A NEW PIE RECIPE.

05:58.667 --> 06:01.233
IF I COULD JUST FIND
THE DARN FLOUR.

06:01.267 --> 06:02.600
- WELL, CLEM,

06:02.633 --> 06:04.433
HAVE YOU CHECKED THE HUGE BAG
ON YOUR SHOULDER

06:04.467 --> 06:06.467
LABELED "FLOUR"?

06:06.500 --> 06:07.533
- NO...

06:07.567 --> 06:09.800
BUT I'M GONNA.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.133
both: WOW.

06:17.467 --> 06:19.300
- CAST AND CREW,

06:19.333 --> 06:21.333
I HAVE SOME DISTRESSING NEWS,

06:21.367 --> 06:25.233
BUT I WON'T DANCE
AROUND THE TOOTH.

06:25.267 --> 06:28.400
SO USING THAT.

06:28.433 --> 06:30.167
BECAUSE OF AN INJURY,

06:30.200 --> 06:32.200
WE NEED TO REPLACE FRANKIE
WITH A NEW DETECTIVE FLOSS.

06:32.233 --> 06:34.833
SO PLAYING THE PART
OF OUR STAR

06:34.867 --> 06:36.500
WILL NOW BE NONE OTHER THA--

06:36.533 --> 06:38.100
YES! YES!

06:38.133 --> 06:39.400
IN YOUR FACE, WORLD!

06:39.433 --> 06:44.233
MY TIME HAS COME, BABY!

06:44.267 --> 06:45.800
IT'S NOT ME, IS IT?

06:45.833 --> 06:47.267
- NO.

06:48.833 --> 06:51.167
DETECTIVE FLOSS
WILL NOW BE PLAYED

06:51.200 --> 06:54.067
BY OUR NEW EXCHANGE STUDENT,
LOUIE.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.167
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.

06:58.200 --> 07:02.133
- OKAY, PLACES, PEOPLE!

07:02.167 --> 07:05.333
SO FAR, SO GOOD.
NO ONE SUSPECTS ANYTHING.

07:05.367 --> 07:08.500
AND ACTION!

07:08.533 --> 07:11.100
- LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF THIS CAVITY!

07:11.133 --> 07:13.567
WHAT KIND OF LOWLIFE GERM
WOULD ATTACK

07:13.600 --> 07:16.300
AN INNOCENT TOOTH
LIKE THIS?

07:16.333 --> 07:19.767
ANY IDEAS, GINGER VITUS?

07:19.800 --> 07:23.267
- NICE TRY, FLOSS,
BUT I HAVE AN ALIBI.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.400
- PRETTY DAME.

07:26.433 --> 07:29.333
BUT I THINK SHE'S GIVING ME
THE BRUSH-OFF.

07:29.367 --> 07:32.600
REALLY?

07:32.633 --> 07:34.733
I'LL FIND OUT WHO DID THIS,

07:34.767 --> 07:37.433
BECAUSE IF NOT ME, WHO?

07:37.467 --> 07:38.400
WHO?

07:45.133 --> 07:47.067
- LOUIE, THAT WAS AMAZING.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.100
- YOU'RE WAY BETTER
THAN FRANKIE.

07:49.133 --> 07:52.467
- WILL YOU SPEAK
AT MY BAR MITZVAH?

07:54.500 --> 07:56.633
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
COME BACK AND SEE US AGAIN.

07:56.667 --> 07:59.233
- AH, MUCH BETTER, TAYLOR.

07:59.267 --> 08:01.200
YOU WERE POLITE,
YOU SMILED,

08:01.233 --> 08:02.533
YOU GAVE BACK
THE CORRECT CHANGE.

08:02.567 --> 08:04.133
THOSE ARE THE POSITIVES.

08:04.167 --> 08:06.800
NOW LET'S DISCUSS
AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT.

08:06.833 --> 08:08.500
ITEM ONE--
YOUR POSTURE.

08:08.533 --> 08:12.333
- MILES, YOU'VE BEEN
CRITICIZING ME ALL DAY.

08:12.367 --> 08:16.233
UM, MY ATTENTION
TO DETAIL IS THE REASON

08:16.267 --> 08:17.667
WHY THIS TIP JAR
IS ALMOST FULL.

08:17.700 --> 08:19.733
- NO, THAT TIP JAR
IS ALMOST FULL

08:19.767 --> 08:22.267
BECAUSE I'M THE ONLY ONE
ACTUALLY DOING ANYTHING,

08:22.300 --> 08:24.100
SO STOP ACTING LIKE
YOU'RE IN CHARGE.

08:24.133 --> 08:25.400
- OH, WAKE UP.

08:25.433 --> 08:28.100
WE BOTH KNOW
I'M RUNNING THIS RODEO.

08:28.133 --> 08:29.600
- HEY, I NEED SOME FEEDBACK
ON A SONG

08:29.633 --> 08:32.667
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON
FOR MICHELLE'S PLAY.

08:32.700 --> 08:34.133
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:34.167 --> 08:36.133
- BUSINESS IS BOOMING,
THANKS TO ME.

08:36.167 --> 08:37.533
- MILES PUTS A MUFFIN
ON A STICK

08:37.567 --> 08:39.067
AND THINKS HE'S THE BOSS.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.400
- I THOUGHT THE NEW GUY CLEM
WAS THE BOSS.

08:41.433 --> 08:44.800
- THIS ROLLING PIN
IS AMAZING!

08:44.833 --> 08:49.233
- THAT'S A FIRE EXTINGUISHER,
CLEM.

08:49.267 --> 08:53.533
- AWW, YOU ALMOST HAD ME,
TAYLOR.

08:53.567 --> 08:56.167
- WOW.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.733
LOOK, ISN'T IT POSSIBLE
YOU'RE BOTH THE REASON

08:58.767 --> 09:00.300
THE BAKERY IS DOING
SO GREAT?

09:00.333 --> 09:01.833
both: NO.

09:01.867 --> 09:03.567
- LOOK.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.833
WHEN IT COMES TO ORGANIZATION,
I'M THE REAL DEAL.

09:05.867 --> 09:08.267
DAD, YOU REMEMBER
THAT FILING CONTEST

09:08.300 --> 09:09.600
WHERE I TOOK HOME
THE BLUE RIBBON?

09:09.633 --> 09:12.467
- YES, I DO, SON.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.867
- IT'S TOO BAD WE DON'T
EACH HAVE OUR OWN BAKERY.

09:14.900 --> 09:16.533
THEN WE COULD SEE
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE

09:16.567 --> 09:18.167
FOR FILLING THAT TIP JAR.

09:18.200 --> 09:21.633
- THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

09:21.667 --> 09:22.700
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:22.733 --> 09:24.667
PROBLEM SOLVED.

09:31.267 --> 09:33.300
NOW YOU EACH HAVE
YOUR OWN WORKSPACE.

09:33.333 --> 09:36.567
BUT I BET YOU'LL FIND
THAT YOU CAN DO MORE TOGETHER

09:36.600 --> 09:37.633
THAN YOU CAN APART.

09:37.667 --> 09:39.433
- THAT'S GENIUS, RAY.

09:39.467 --> 09:41.500
OH, MILES,
LOOKS LIKE A CUSTOMER

09:41.533 --> 09:43.333
ON YOUR HALF
NEEDS SOME SERVICE.

09:43.367 --> 09:45.333
- OH, YOU'LL HAVE TO HELP ME.

09:45.367 --> 09:46.800
MIGHT LOOK WEIRD IF A GHOST
WAITED ON HER.

09:46.833 --> 09:50.267
- SORRY, I DON'T WORK
ON THAT SIDE ANYMORE.

09:50.300 --> 09:52.100
YIKES.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.467
- OH, SO WE'RE PLAYING IT
THAT WAY?

09:56.767 --> 09:58.467
* FLOSS

09:58.500 --> 10:02.533
* I WANNA CLEAN FOREVER

10:02.567 --> 10:04.767
* I WANNA KEEP
YOUR BREATH FRESH *

10:04.800 --> 10:06.200
* FLOSS

10:06.233 --> 10:09.833
* I COME IN MINT
OR UNSCENTED *

10:09.867 --> 10:12.233
* BABY, REMEMBER MY NAME

10:12.267 --> 10:15.233
* REMEMBER, REMEMBER,
REMEMBER, RE-- *

10:17.700 --> 10:20.500
REMEMBER?

10:22.167 --> 10:23.533
TAKE THAT, ROBOTS!

10:23.567 --> 10:27.267
AND ANOTHER LOUIE HIGH SCORE
GOES BYE-BYE.

10:29.167 --> 10:31.600
- LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE'S TOE
IS BETTER.

10:31.633 --> 10:35.167
I'M PLAYING THROUGH THE PAIN.

10:35.200 --> 10:38.100
SO HOW'D REHEARSAL GO?

10:38.133 --> 10:39.333
TORTURE, HUH?

10:39.367 --> 10:41.400
- ACTUALLY...

10:41.433 --> 10:43.800
- PIZZA PARTY IN HONOR OF LOUIE!

10:46.400 --> 10:49.167
- A WHAT PARTY
IN HONOR OF WHO NOW?

10:49.200 --> 10:50.600
- DON'T GET ME WRONG.

10:50.633 --> 10:52.633
WE MISSED YOU TERRIBLY,
SWEETIE.

10:52.667 --> 10:56.167
BUT TODAY, LOUIE REMINDED ME
WHY I WRITE,

10:56.200 --> 10:58.800
WHY I CREATE.

10:58.833 --> 11:02.467
- IT'S TRUE.
I DID.

11:02.500 --> 11:05.667
- I LOVE YOUR COMMITMENT
OF NEVER TAKING OFF THE COSTUME.

11:05.700 --> 11:07.733
- OH, LIKE YOU AND YOUR EARS.

11:13.133 --> 11:16.167
- ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY.
COME GET FOOD.

11:16.200 --> 11:17.733
- THIS IS JUST LIKE
THE PIZZA PARTY

11:17.767 --> 11:19.500
YOUR MOM THREW YOU.

11:19.533 --> 11:20.633
OH, WAIT.

11:20.667 --> 11:22.133
THAT NEVER HAPPENED!

11:26.900 --> 11:29.667
- THE CAST KNOWS HOW YOU LIKE
TO UNWIND WITH VIDEO GAMES,

11:29.700 --> 11:34.100
SO WE POOLED OUR MONEY
AND GOT YOU THIS.

11:36.500 --> 11:39.700
THAT'S LIMITED EDITION!

11:39.733 --> 11:41.433
- HOW KIND.

11:41.467 --> 11:43.167
I'LL TREASURE IT.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.267
NOW GO.

11:44.300 --> 11:46.333
GRAB YOURSELF SOME 'ZA.

11:48.267 --> 11:50.300
- YOU'RE REALLY ENJOYING THIS,
AREN'T YOU?

11:50.333 --> 11:53.167
- LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE.

11:56.233 --> 11:59.200
- MOM, IT'S A MIRACLE.
MY TOE'S ALL BETTER.

11:59.233 --> 12:00.633
NOW I CAN HAVE
MY PART BACK.

12:00.667 --> 12:03.667
- NO, FRANKIE.
YOUR FOOT NEEDS TO REST.

12:03.700 --> 12:06.200
- I AGREE, MICHELLE.
POOR FRANKIE.

12:06.233 --> 12:09.800
OR AS WE SAY
IN THE THEATER...

12:09.833 --> 12:13.633
"LOSER!"

12:18.467 --> 12:21.367
- IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE
I COMPOSED AN ORIGINAL TUNE,

12:21.400 --> 12:23.067
AND I WAS STRUGGLING.
- HMM.

12:23.100 --> 12:27.633
- BUT THIS--
THIS IS A CLOSING NUMBER.

12:27.667 --> 12:30.267
- * FLOSS, FLOSS,
FLOSS YOUR TEETH *

12:30.300 --> 12:31.767
* GENTLY ON THE GUM

12:31.800 --> 12:33.633
* MERRILY, MERRILY,
MERRILY, MERRILY *

12:33.667 --> 12:36.433
* CLEANING TEETH IS FUN

12:36.467 --> 12:38.733
YOU SICKEN ME.
YOU'RE OFF THE PROJECT.

12:40.233 --> 12:44.100
THIS IS GOLD, BABY!
GOLD!

12:50.367 --> 12:51.733
- I FEEL A SLIGHT CHILL.

12:51.767 --> 12:56.500
CAN SOMEBODY BE A LAMB
AND BRING ME MY ROBE?

13:00.833 --> 13:03.400
- OH, PUKE.

13:03.433 --> 13:06.100
- HONEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

13:06.133 --> 13:07.533
- JUST WANTED
TO SHOW SUPPORT.

13:07.567 --> 13:09.100
- AWW.

13:09.133 --> 13:10.533
- LOUIE LOOKS LIKE
HE'S BECOME A HANDFUL.

13:10.567 --> 13:12.067
- MM. WORTH THE JOURNEY.

13:12.067 --> 13:14.133
HE TEACHES ME
SOMETHING NEW EVERY DAY.

13:19.500 --> 13:23.333
- LET'S TAKE FIVE, EVERYONE.

13:23.367 --> 13:25.300
- OKAY, LOUIE.
THIS ENDS NOW.

13:25.333 --> 13:27.700
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE THE STAR
OF THIS PLAY.

13:27.733 --> 13:30.733
- AND YET YOU'RE NOT.

13:30.767 --> 13:32.300
- OKAY, FUNNY GUY.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.200
ARE YOU GONNA GIVE ME
MY ROLE BACK OR NOT?

13:34.233 --> 13:35.600
- I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT.

13:35.633 --> 13:38.200
MY ANSWER RHYMES
WITH NO.

13:38.233 --> 13:40.633
IT'S NO.

13:40.667 --> 13:43.500
- FINE.
THEN I'M GONNA TAKE IT BACK.

13:43.533 --> 13:45.700
ATTENTION, DRAMA DORKS,

13:45.733 --> 13:48.067
LOUIE IS NOT
WHO YOU THINK HE IS.

13:48.067 --> 13:51.567
CHECK THIS OUT.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.333
- FRANKIE, CUT IT OUT!

13:55.233 --> 13:57.600
- WHOA, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

13:57.633 --> 14:00.267
HE'S A GREAT ACTOR
AND A MAGICIAN!

14:03.700 --> 14:05.133
- NICE TRY.

14:05.167 --> 14:06.600
BUT THE PEOPLE LOVE ME.

14:06.633 --> 14:09.433
FLOSS-TA LA VISTA, BABY.

14:12.700 --> 14:16.267
- MILES, MY BAKERY IS SO GONNA
KICK YOUR BAKERY'S BUTT.

14:16.300 --> 14:18.467
YOU KNOW, IT ISN'T REALLY
A FAIR COMPETITION

14:18.500 --> 14:20.400
SINCE CUSTOMERS
CAN'T EVEN SEE YOU.

14:20.433 --> 14:23.300
- WHICH IS WHY I SPENT
ALL MORNING...

14:23.333 --> 14:28.067
WORKING ON THIS!

14:28.067 --> 14:30.367
THE MILES-O-PIES 3000!

14:30.400 --> 14:33.267
NOW ADDED WITH BOW TIE.

14:35.100 --> 14:38.200
- I FULLY AUTOMATED THE ENTIRE
PIE-DELIVERING PROCESS.

14:38.233 --> 14:41.200
ALSO, HIS ARMS SQUIRT...

14:41.233 --> 14:43.067
WHIPPED CREAM
AND CHOCOLATE SYRUP.

14:43.067 --> 14:45.700
BUT I LIKE YOUR LITTLE
PASTRY PYRAMID THING --

14:45.733 --> 14:49.633
THAT TOOK THOUGHT TOO.

14:49.667 --> 14:52.533
- HEY, EVERYTHING GOING
OKAY IN HERE?

14:52.567 --> 14:54.267
- GREAT.

14:54.300 --> 14:56.200
I JUST DIVIDED THE BAKERY
IN HALF AND ADDED A ROBOT.

14:56.233 --> 15:00.133
- OH, OKEYDOKEY.

15:02.467 --> 15:04.133
- WELCOME.

15:04.167 --> 15:07.467
THE MILES-O-PIES 3000 IS READY
TO SERVE YOU TODAY.

15:07.500 --> 15:09.733
- OR YOU CAN COME OVER HERE
AND BE SERVED

15:09.767 --> 15:11.200
BY A FRIENDLY STAFFER

15:11.233 --> 15:13.067
WHO DOESN'T HAVE
TO BE PLUGGED IN.

15:13.067 --> 15:17.500
PLEASE NOTE
THE PASTRY PYRAMID.

15:17.533 --> 15:20.067
- I'M GOING WITH THE ROBOT.

15:20.067 --> 15:23.800
- OKAY.
SO YOU GOT LUCKY ONE TIME.

15:27.567 --> 15:30.067
- FINALLY, A CUSTOMER!

15:30.067 --> 15:31.767
HI, THERE.
WHAT CAN I GET YOU TODAY?

15:31.800 --> 15:33.167
- A TOILET.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.400
- IT'S IN THE BACK.

15:35.433 --> 15:38.500
- LOVE THE PYRAMID.

15:41.767 --> 15:43.667
- OPENING NIGHT.

15:43.700 --> 15:45.700
THIS IS SO HUMBLING.

15:45.733 --> 15:48.633
TAKE THESE ROSES
AND THROW THEM AT ME WHEN I BOW.

15:48.667 --> 15:50.300
- SO, SON,

15:50.333 --> 15:52.067
WE JUST WANTED TO COME BACK
AND SAY BREAK A LEG.

15:52.100 --> 15:54.133
BUT NOT A TOE, BECAUSE THEN
YOU'LL LOSE YOUR PART.

15:54.167 --> 15:56.567
AM I RIGHT, FRANKIE?

15:56.600 --> 15:59.433
SHE KNOWS
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

15:59.467 --> 16:05.200
- I'M SORRY, WHAT SCENE IS
YOUR ORIGINAL SONG IN AGAIN?

16:05.233 --> 16:08.333
- I'M GONNA GO FIND MY SEAT.

16:08.367 --> 16:11.167
- LOUIE,
WHEN YOU CAME TO ME,

16:11.200 --> 16:13.100
YOU WERE A FRIGHTENED,
TIMID CATERPILLAR.

16:13.133 --> 16:14.300
- NO, I WASN'T.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.067
- YES, YOU WERE.

16:16.067 --> 16:18.733
BUT NOW I'VE TURNED YOU
INTO A TALENTED BUTTERFLY

16:18.767 --> 16:19.733
READY TO SOAR.

16:20.767 --> 16:25.133
FLY, TINY ACTOR.
FLY.

16:25.167 --> 16:26.200
- OKAY.

16:26.233 --> 16:27.633
BEST OF LUCK.

16:27.667 --> 16:30.667
HOPE YOU GET ANY SURPRISES
OUT THERE ONSTAGE.

16:35.700 --> 16:38.067
- GET THAT STUPID BRUSH
OUT OF HERE.

16:38.067 --> 16:42.067
HE'S CONTAMINATING
MY CRIME SCENE.

16:42.067 --> 16:44.067
- I DON'T USE THE WORD
"MASTERPIECE" A LOT.

16:44.067 --> 16:46.067
OF ALL MY MASTERPIECES,

16:46.067 --> 16:50.333
THIS IS
MY MOST MASTER...PIECIEST.

16:50.367 --> 16:53.467
SHH, SHH, SHH.
LET'S WATCH.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.767
- DETECTIVE,
HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT

16:55.800 --> 16:57.600
WHO CAUSED THIS CAVITY CRIME?

16:57.633 --> 17:01.567
AND IF SO,
CAN YOU TELL US IN A SONG?

17:01.600 --> 17:03.833
- I HAVE, AND I WILL.

17:03.867 --> 17:05.533
GIVE ME A BEAT!

17:08.500 --> 17:10.433
- WAIT!

17:10.467 --> 17:14.200
EVERYBODY, FREEZE.

17:17.667 --> 17:20.067
I'M THE NEW DETECTIVE
WHO'S TAKING OVER THIS CASE.

17:20.067 --> 17:21.700
- YOU'RE A CHRISTMAS TREE.

17:21.733 --> 17:24.767
- NOT A LOT OF OPTIONS
IN THE COSTUME ROOM.

17:24.800 --> 17:28.600
IT WAS EITHER THIS
OR THE STATUE OF LIBERTY.

17:30.200 --> 17:31.633
- OKAY, DETECTIVE.
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

17:31.667 --> 17:33.500
YOU'RE OFF THE CASE.
NOW GIVE ME THE BADGE!

17:33.533 --> 17:36.567
- NO WAY!
THIS IS MY CRIME SCENE.

17:40.167 --> 17:41.367
- OH!

17:48.467 --> 17:50.367
- HOW'S BUSINESS
ON YOUR HALF?

17:50.400 --> 17:52.067
DOESN'T LOOK TOO GOOD.

17:52.067 --> 17:54.133
- I HAVE A FEELING
IT'S ABOUT TO PICK UP.

17:54.167 --> 17:57.500
OH, CLEM?

17:57.533 --> 17:59.300
CLEM HERE HAS
GRACIOUSLY OFFERED

17:59.333 --> 18:01.333
TO PLAY THE BAGPIPES
FOR YOU ALL.

18:01.367 --> 18:03.500
- THIS INSTRUMENT
COMES WITH A DRESS.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.667
- NOPE.

18:07.700 --> 18:08.767
WHICH IS WHY
HE'S GONNA DO IT

18:08.800 --> 18:10.300
ON YOUR SIDE
OF THE BAKERY.

18:10.333 --> 18:11.667
TAKE IT AWAY, CLEM.

18:11.700 --> 18:12.667
- OH, RIGHT ON.

18:12.700 --> 18:15.267
IT'S MY FIRST CONCERT.

18:18.300 --> 18:20.067

- NICE TRY, TAY.
BAGPIPE CAMP.

18:32.500 --> 18:34.233
TWO SUMMERS.

18:34.267 --> 18:37.333
- I AM ROCKING THIS.

18:37.367 --> 18:38.667
- ALL RIGHT.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.133
ATTENTION, CUSTOMERS!

18:40.167 --> 18:43.067
BUY ONE PIE,
GET ONE FREE.

18:43.100 --> 18:45.467
YOU CAN'T UNDERSELL ME!

18:45.500 --> 18:48.067
ATTENTION:
BUY NO PIE, GET ONE FREE!

18:49.400 --> 18:50.600
NO FAIR!

18:50.633 --> 18:52.233
SORRY.

18:52.267 --> 18:53.600
I CAN'T HEAR YOU
ABOVE ALL THE RINGING

18:53.633 --> 18:55.200
OF THE CASH REGISTER,

18:55.233 --> 18:57.067
WHICH I'M ONLY DOING
SOUND EFFECTS

18:57.100 --> 19:00.267
BECAUSE I'M GIVING AWAY
ALL THE PIES.

19:00.300 --> 19:02.300
- YOU LIKE FREE PIES
SO MUCH?

19:02.333 --> 19:05.367
HAVE SOME MORE, ROBOT MAN.

19:06.533 --> 19:09.567
- MY BABY.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.700
OH, IT'S ON.

19:23.767 --> 19:25.733
all: OH!

19:25.767 --> 19:27.400
- AAH!

19:36.133 --> 19:38.267
- GINGER VITUS,
I KNOW IT WAS YOU

19:38.300 --> 19:39.633
WHO CAUSED THIS CAVITY,

19:39.667 --> 19:41.167
SO CONFESS TO ME!

19:41.200 --> 19:44.233
- NO, CONFESS TO ME,
GINGER VITUS!

19:44.267 --> 19:45.567
- DON'T LISTEN TO HER.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.200
SHE'S JUST AN INSANE TREE.

19:47.233 --> 19:50.500
WHAT'S SHE DOING
IN A MOUTH ANYWAY?

19:50.533 --> 19:53.400
- I'M SO CONFUSED.

19:53.433 --> 19:55.500
- STOP IT, BOTH OF YOU!

19:55.533 --> 19:58.333
FOR IT IS I...

19:58.367 --> 20:01.367
INSPECTOR LIBERTY.

20:03.700 --> 20:08.100
- I GOT TO START COMING
TO THE THEATER MORE OFTEN.

20:08.133 --> 20:10.067
- CHRISTMAS TREE,

20:10.100 --> 20:12.000
YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE.

20:12.033 --> 20:16.000
- BUT THIS WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE MY CASE.

20:16.033 --> 20:18.367
- BUT THEN IT BECAME MY CASE

20:18.400 --> 20:19.700
WHEN YOU HURT YOURSELF.

20:19.733 --> 20:21.500
OR PRETENDED TO.

20:23.200 --> 20:26.033
WHAT DOES DETECTIVE FLOSS
MEAN BY "PRETENDED TO"?

20:26.067 --> 20:30.033
- I THOUGHT THIS PLAY--
OR CASE WAS GONNA BE A DUD.

20:30.067 --> 20:31.467
I'M SORRY.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.467
- I THINK THE THREE OF US

20:33.500 --> 20:36.000
NEED TO DISCUSS THIS
BACK AT HEADQUARTERS.

20:36.033 --> 20:37.067
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

20:37.100 --> 20:38.733
WHEN AM I GOING
TO CONFESS?

20:38.767 --> 20:40.767
- YOU JUST DID, GINGER.
YOU JUST DID.

20:40.800 --> 20:43.800
BOOK HER, TOOTHPASTE.

20:47.233 --> 20:49.267
FRANKIE, IF YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO DO THE PLAY,

20:49.300 --> 20:51.100
YOU SHOULD'VE JUST TOLD ME.

20:51.133 --> 20:53.033
- I KNOW.
I WAS WRONG.

20:53.067 --> 20:55.067
AND THEN LOUIE
WAS SO MUCH BETTER THAN ME

20:55.100 --> 20:57.033
IN THE PLAY,
I GOT JEALOUS.

20:57.067 --> 20:58.633
- WELL, NOW YOU KNOW
HOW IT FEELS.

21:00.500 --> 21:02.100
- WHY DO YOU THINK
I DON'T WANT YOU

21:02.133 --> 21:03.667
PLAYING MY VIDEO GAMES?

21:03.700 --> 21:05.833
YOU ALWAYS CRUSH
MY HIGH SCORE.

21:05.867 --> 21:08.767
IT'S NOT FUN.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.567
- SORRY I MADE YOU FEEL BAD.

21:10.600 --> 21:14.133
- SORRY MY TALENTS MADE YOU
FEEL INADEQUATE.

21:15.667 --> 21:19.600
- I AM SO PROUD
OF YOU TWO.

21:21.667 --> 21:23.633
BUT I'M NOT TAKING A HIT
FOR THIS STINKER.

21:23.667 --> 21:26.267
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

21:30.367 --> 21:32.367
THEY LIKED ME!

21:49.067 --> 21:51.533
- WE FOUND OUT
WHO THE BETTER MANAGER WAS.

21:51.567 --> 21:54.100
- YEAH.
NEITHER OF US.

21:54.133 --> 21:56.600
- WHAT ABOUT THE GUY
YOUR MOM HIRED?

21:56.633 --> 21:58.733
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE SUPERVISED.

21:58.767 --> 22:00.500
- YO, T.

22:00.533 --> 22:04.800
ANY IDEA HOW TO GET
A SNEAKER OUT OF A TOASTER?

22:06.467 --> 22:08.467
- MAKES SENSE NOW.
