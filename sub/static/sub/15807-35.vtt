    and you'll hear a tale ¶

00:05.471 --> 00:07.439
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:07.508 --> 00:09.808
¶ That started
    from this tropic port ¶

00:09.876 --> 00:12.177
¶ Aboard this tiny ship ¶

00:12.246 --> 00:14.512

00:27.561 --> 00:29.461
¶ The weather started
     getting rough ¶

00:29.530 --> 00:31.463
¶ The tiny ship was tossed ¶

    of the fearless crew ¶

Great.

[panting]

02:12.732 --> 02:14.566
I got ya!

02:14.635 --> 02:17.969
Get it off of me. I don't
like this, take it off.

02:18.037 --> 02:19.337
Oh!

02:19.406 --> 02:21.039
Gilligan, what's
the meaning of this?

02:21.108 --> 02:23.308
I'm sorry. Just trying out my
 new butterfly net.

02:23.377 --> 02:26.378
Do hurry, Lovey. My-my arm
   is getting stiff.

02:26.446 --> 02:28.046
What you doing?

02:28.115 --> 02:30.849
If you must know, I'm trying
  to shoot Mr. Howell.

02:30.918 --> 02:33.484
Don't do that. I know married
couples have their diff--

02:33.553 --> 02:35.821
- Don't be silly. With a camera!
- Oh, oh!

02:35.889 --> 02:37.189
[cracking]

02:39.192 --> 02:41.759
Oh, Mrs. Howell!
It's a great nig-nog.

02:41.828 --> 02:45.697
Oh, Mrs. Howell. It's a great
 big rock and it's coming down.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.432
[loud thud]

02:49.236 --> 02:50.736
Oh!

02:50.804 --> 02:54.072
Lovey, Lovey, my dear,
are you alright?

02:54.140 --> 02:55.674
Oh! There, my dear.

02:55.743 --> 02:58.476
Yes, yes, I'm alright.
     Thanks to Gilligan.

02:58.545 --> 03:01.313
- We are forever in your debt.
- Oh, it wasn't anything.

03:01.381 --> 03:04.415
Not anything? You just saved
    my life, that's all.

03:04.484 --> 03:06.784
You couldn't be braver
if you were our own son.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.453
Oh, Thurston.

03:08.522 --> 03:11.055
Wouldn't it be wonderful
   if we had a son like Gilligan

03:11.124 --> 03:14.659
'who risked his life
 to save mine the way he did.'

03:14.727 --> 03:17.329
That's okay, Mr. Howell.
  I'd do it for my own mother.

03:17.398 --> 03:20.865
Oh, Thurston,
     we haven't got a son.

03:20.934 --> 03:24.235
True. We have no one to bear
our name proudly and bravely.

03:24.304 --> 03:27.305
Do you think we should..
    Could we?

03:27.374 --> 03:29.975
- Let's..
    - Let's what Mr. Howell?

03:30.043 --> 03:32.109
Not Mr. Howell. Dad.

03:32.178 --> 03:36.047
'Gilligan Thurston Howell IV,
 we adopt you. Officially.'

03:36.116 --> 03:38.450
Hee hee.
Kiss your mother.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.328
Here ye, hear ye.

03:50.396 --> 03:52.431
I, Thurston Howell III

03:52.499 --> 03:55.500
do formally declare
      from this day forth

03:55.569 --> 03:58.937
that poor indigent fellow
   known as Gilligan

03:59.005 --> 04:03.074
shall become
  Gilligan Thurston Howell IV

04:03.142 --> 04:05.410
my legal son and heir.

04:06.446 --> 04:07.578
- You!
          - Witnesses.

04:07.647 --> 04:09.381
What's the matter, Ginger?

04:09.450 --> 04:11.483
Oh, I always cry
at weddings

04:11.552 --> 04:14.619
and being adopted
by millionaires.

04:14.687 --> 04:18.289
Captain, the naval person
      the Admiralty represented.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.058
Ha ha, ha ha.

04:20.127 --> 04:23.461
Oh, and uh, there's Professor,
  the academic world

04:23.530 --> 04:26.598
cloistered halls
                and all that..

04:26.667 --> 04:28.633
Ah, mother.
                This is our day.

04:28.702 --> 04:32.837
Oh, darling. At last,
we have a son. Oh..

04:32.906 --> 04:35.140
Not exactly what we might
have expected of course

04:35.209 --> 04:37.142
but a brave dear boy.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.944
Yes, my dear.
                 Can you imagine

04:39.012 --> 04:41.646
after all these years
  walking in to the Harvard Club

04:41.714 --> 04:44.649
and saying fellows,
       I want you to meet my son

04:44.718 --> 04:47.652
Gilligan Thurston Howell IV.

04:47.721 --> 04:51.022
Gilligan Thurston Howell IV.
  Isn't that one..

04:51.091 --> 04:53.258
[indistinct chatter]

04:53.327 --> 04:55.126
- Ugh.
   - What's the matter, dear?

04:55.195 --> 04:57.796
I was just imagining
   walking into the Harvard club

04:57.864 --> 05:01.265
after all these years with him
 and saying, fellows, I want you

05:01.334 --> 05:03.734
to meet my son
    Gilligan Thurston Howell IV.

05:03.803 --> 05:04.770
Yeckles!

05:06.340 --> 05:09.641
Rest of your stuff, Gilligan.
 Well, off to your new home.

05:09.709 --> 05:11.777
- Thanks, professor, Skipper.
 - Yeah, alright.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.612
Oh, Gilligan, don't forget now.

05:13.681 --> 05:16.213
Don't eat any pineapple 'cause
  it always gives you a rash.

05:16.282 --> 05:18.784
- I won't forget, Skipper.
 - Oh, wait, and-and, Gilligan.

05:18.852 --> 05:21.653
- Call me if you need anything.
- Okay, Skipper.

05:21.721 --> 05:24.789
I mean any time of the day
    or night or well, you know..

05:24.858 --> 05:26.858
- Okay, Skipper. See you later.
- Good luck.

05:28.561 --> 05:31.729
Oh, I'm gonna sure
     miss him around here.

05:31.798 --> 05:34.031
I used to take care
             of him, you know.

05:34.100 --> 05:37.034
I took care of everything
   that he has though, his clo..

05:37.103 --> 05:39.137
He forgot his handkerchief,
     I better get 'em over.

05:39.205 --> 05:42.240
He's just going to the other
hut. He doesn't need them.

05:42.309 --> 05:44.876
He's gonna need them
     to wipe his eyes, Professor

05:44.944 --> 05:47.211
when he starts crying.
         The poor home sick kid.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.813
What makes you think
he's gonna cry?

05:48.881 --> 05:50.548
Because I am crying
             right now.

05:50.617 --> 05:53.551
I-I'll break every bone
      in his body if he doesn't.

05:53.620 --> 05:56.021
Oh, Skipper. Try to think
of it as this way.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.756
Losing your first mature,
you gain a benefactor.

05:58.825 --> 06:01.492
Gilligan can afford to buy you
a whole fleet of ships now.

06:01.561 --> 06:03.061
Oh, who cares about that?

06:03.130 --> 06:05.563
He's not cut out to be
          a millionaire's son.

06:05.632 --> 06:08.199
"Buy me a whole fleet
           of ships?!"

06:08.268 --> 06:10.801
Darling, remember Pygmalion?

06:10.870 --> 06:13.038
Professor Higgins
did wonders with Eliza.

06:13.107 --> 06:14.940
Yes, my dear, but
               Professor Higgins

06:15.008 --> 06:17.042
had only to deal with the dirty
 ignorant little gutter-snipe.

06:17.111 --> 06:20.078
- We have Gilligan.
      - Did you call?

06:21.147 --> 06:23.081
[music]

06:25.652 --> 06:28.320
ALovey, it'll take a miracle.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.122
Well, Gilligan.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.495
No, Gilligan.

06:37.664 --> 06:38.897
Hold it, don't!

06:39.766 --> 06:41.966
My darling,
                I-I bid a spade.

06:42.035 --> 06:44.035
I bid two cloves.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.936
Gilligan?

06:46.005 --> 06:46.971
Gin.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.006
- No.
             - No.

06:49.376 --> 06:50.675
Now, Gilligan,
              I'm sure that even

06:50.744 --> 06:52.677
you know what to do
             with a fingerbowl.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.546
Fingerbowl? Oh sure!

06:55.715 --> 06:58.316
Oh, no! Oh, Gilligan!

06:58.384 --> 06:59.784
Now, think very hard.

06:59.852 --> 07:01.953
We've been over this
   everyday for over a week.

07:02.022 --> 07:05.123
Now, tell me, think,
what is money?

07:05.192 --> 07:07.225
I don't know, Mr. Howell.
   It's all so difficult.

07:07.294 --> 07:10.028
It's so hard to remember money
 is something you never spend.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.930
That's it! Money is something
 you never spend.

07:11.999 --> 07:16.567
- That's right! You make more.
 - Good boy!

07:16.636 --> 07:18.570
Now, what are your
       favorite sports?

07:18.638 --> 07:22.907
My favorite sports are tennis,
polo, sailing and, um..

07:22.976 --> 07:25.844
- Can you give me a hint?
   - Uh, Tally ho!

07:25.913 --> 07:27.979
[gibberish]

07:31.585 --> 07:33.218
Hee hee hee. Whoa!

07:34.053 --> 07:36.320
Baseball!

07:36.389 --> 07:39.924
Not Baseball. uh? Let me see, I
was coming to it, its the hunt.

07:39.993 --> 07:43.161
My favorite sports are tennis,
 polo, sailing and the hunt!

07:43.230 --> 07:47.031
Oh, he's really gonna make it,
  Thurston. He really is.

07:47.100 --> 07:50.502
I'm so proud of you.
     Now, your schools are?

07:50.570 --> 07:52.136
Harvard, you silly goose.

07:52.205 --> 07:54.138
The way you said
       it was delightful.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.307
First thing in the morning.
  What do you do?

07:56.376 --> 07:59.144
You stand up at attention,
face east and salute Port Norks.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.212
Also, a gentlemen never trumps
 his partners ace

08:01.281 --> 08:04.015
and the government is tryin'
  to give away our country.

08:04.084 --> 08:07.085
The rain in spain falls mainly
on the New York stock exchange.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.619
I know, he's got it.

08:08.688 --> 08:10.055
He's a Howell.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.958
Can you believe
   the luck some people have?

08:14.027 --> 08:17.328
Imagine, Gilligan being
   adopted by a millionaire.

08:17.397 --> 08:19.397
Yeah, my very best friend.

08:19.466 --> 08:20.665
Our best friend.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.634
My little buddy,
            can you imagine that

08:22.703 --> 08:24.970
being able to buy
         a whole fleet of ships.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.578
Hi, Mary Ann.

08:35.648 --> 08:37.349
Can I go butterfly
huntin' with you?

08:37.417 --> 08:38.982
Oh, I'm sorry,
                  Gilligan.

08:39.052 --> 08:41.785
You'll get your new clothes
  all dirty. I'll tell you what.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.821
I'll go catch some
      and bring it to you, okay?

08:43.890 --> 08:46.591
Yeah, but Mary Ann, I like
to go butterfly hunting..

08:49.763 --> 08:52.631
You know, this tar should make
the huts really waterproof.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.799
It's wonderful the way
          you made this tar

08:54.868 --> 08:56.301
out of the minerals
             on the island.

08:56.370 --> 08:57.968
Hi, Skipper.
         Hi, Professor.

08:58.037 --> 09:01.672
- 'Well, Gilligan, look at you''
- Doesn't he look snazzy?

09:01.741 --> 09:03.208
He has a brush.
              I'll help you tar.

09:03.276 --> 09:07.545
Oh, thank you but we can't
      possibly ask you to help.

09:07.614 --> 09:09.880
- Sure I can. I wanna help.
 - Now, don't trouble yourself.

09:09.949 --> 09:12.517
- We'll manage by ourselves.
  - This is no trouble.

09:12.585 --> 09:15.853
Men of great wealth must
  learn to delegate authority.

09:15.922 --> 09:17.589
'Now, why don't you just sit
and down and watch us?'

09:17.657 --> 09:19.690
I don't wanna sit,
              I wanna tar.

09:19.759 --> 09:22.960
Give it. Give it.
Please, sit down now.

09:23.029 --> 09:26.130
Men of your caliber are meant
 to synch, I bet as, bych..

09:26.199 --> 09:27.932
Please just rest
       your signing arm.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.735
No, Skipper. I don't wanna rest.
I just wanna help tar.

09:30.804 --> 09:33.304
- Would you give me that bucket.
- No, I wanna help.

09:33.373 --> 09:34.906
[indistinct]

09:41.848 --> 09:44.883
Skipper, control yourself.
   He didn't mean to.

09:44.951 --> 09:48.686
- I know that, Professor.
   - What did you say?

09:48.754 --> 09:50.888
I said that you didn't
mean to do this.

09:50.957 --> 09:52.890
How come you're not
             yelling at me?

09:52.959 --> 09:55.393
Gilligan, even the best of us
have our little accidents.

09:55.462 --> 09:56.961
Now, please don't
worry about it.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.496
Okay, Skipper,
             I'll see you later.

09:58.564 --> 09:59.798
Yes, Gilligan.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.168
Hi, Ginger.
What you doing?

10:04.237 --> 10:05.970
Doing a love scene
              with Cary Grant.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.705
What does it
                 look like I'm..

10:07.774 --> 10:11.242
Gilligan, I didn't know
         it was you.

10:11.310 --> 10:13.711
- Hello.
            - Hello.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.780
My, don't you look
              handsome today.

10:15.848 --> 10:17.748
I'm all covered with tar.

10:17.817 --> 10:21.319
Well, some men wear tar
         better than others.

10:21.388 --> 10:24.055
I'll help you hang the clothes
and we'll go butterfly hunting?

10:24.124 --> 10:26.123
Oh, Gilligan,
           you're putting me on.

10:26.192 --> 10:28.359
But then, you always
         were so divinely witty.

10:28.428 --> 10:29.794
I was?

10:29.862 --> 10:32.697
Sure. I always felt
    you belonged to the theatre.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.665
Close your eyes
           and try to visualize.

10:34.734 --> 10:35.900
There you are.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.903
Brilliant, young,
               rich producer..

10:40.540 --> 10:42.307
Mad about your
                  leading lady.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.143
- Can you see yourself?
    - Nope.

10:46.212 --> 10:47.612
- Why not?
- You told me to close my eyes.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.046
Open them.

10:49.115 --> 10:52.817
Now, now since you can
          have anything at all.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.385
What do you want?

10:54.454 --> 10:56.954
I'll help you with the clothes
and we'll go butterfly hunting.

10:57.023 --> 11:00.425
Gilligan, hanging up
     the clothes is menial work.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.993
We can't do that now.

11:02.061 --> 11:05.129
Why is everyone telling me what
to do. I know what I can do.

11:05.198 --> 11:09.166
Listen, Ginger, I'm just as good
at clothes hanger up as I was..

11:09.235 --> 11:10.701
Oops.

11:10.770 --> 11:12.703
Sorry, Ginger.
Are you mad?

11:12.772 --> 11:15.540
Not at all. It's what
           I always wanted.

11:15.609 --> 11:17.208
Cross ventilation.

11:19.078 --> 11:22.213
Hello, Gilligan, my boy.
        Where are you?

11:22.282 --> 11:25.583
Ah, there you are.
      I have a surprise for you.

11:25.652 --> 11:27.152
- Adopted somebody else?
    - No!

11:27.220 --> 11:30.554
- Giving you a coming out party.
- Coming out of what?

11:30.623 --> 11:33.758
Coming out of the murky dreary
jungle of untutored mediocrity.

11:33.827 --> 11:36.093
Yuck! I better go take a shower.

11:36.162 --> 11:39.630
- That's my boy. That's--
- My best friends won't tell me.

11:39.699 --> 11:43.301
I'm gonna give you a big party.
You've learnt your lessons well.

11:43.369 --> 11:46.137
And tomorrow, you're gonna be
 officially launched in society.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.206
You're a very, very
             lucky young man.

11:48.274 --> 11:50.675
[laughter]

11:50.744 --> 11:52.944
Did you hear the one about
 the movie star who was divorced

11:53.013 --> 11:55.146
so many times
     she got custody of a judge?

11:59.185 --> 12:01.119
Yeah, I sure am lucky,
alright.

12:06.292 --> 12:07.558
- Alright, ready now?
     - Uh-huh.

12:07.627 --> 12:09.194
¶ Row, row, row your boat ¶

12:09.262 --> 12:11.129
¶ Gently down the stream ¶

12:11.198 --> 12:12.764
¶ Merrily, merrily, merrily ¶
 ¶ Row, row, row row ¶

12:12.832 --> 12:14.465
¶ Gently down the stream ¶

12:14.533 --> 12:16.600
¶ Merrily, merrily,
      merrily, merrily.. ¶

12:16.669 --> 12:19.270
¶ Life is but a dream ¶

12:19.339 --> 12:20.471
Oh, well..

12:20.540 --> 12:23.107
Don't you wanna go out
     and join your friends?

12:23.176 --> 12:25.242
What for? They're just
          laughing and singing.

12:25.311 --> 12:28.346
I get to stay in here and read
 these great financial reports.

12:28.415 --> 12:32.049
Yeah, yeah, yes. The masses are
so easily amused, aren't they?

12:32.118 --> 12:35.119
I bet they even think
        they're having fun, huh?

12:35.187 --> 12:37.355
'Cause it sure sounds like
      they're having fun.

12:37.423 --> 12:41.058
There now, Gilligan. This is all
ready for your debut.

12:41.127 --> 12:42.994
And I'm sure it'll
fit you perfectly.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.029
Oh, what a joyous occasion.

12:45.097 --> 12:47.364
Tomorrow evening, all your
   friends will meet the new

12:47.433 --> 12:48.866
Jean Thurston Howell IV.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.835
Marvelous. Like it was
          made for you.

12:50.904 --> 12:53.338
O-o-oh, isn't it thrilling?

12:53.406 --> 12:56.040
I'll never forget the night
  of my debut party.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.875
Neither will
               the world forget.

12:57.944 --> 13:00.244
That was the night
    Napoleon got it at Waterloo.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.312
Oh, I was just
                joshing my dear.

13:02.381 --> 13:03.981
But you're
         supposed to look happy.

13:04.050 --> 13:06.551
You look like you lost your
     last share of stock.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.553
Everybody's treating me too
fancy. Like I was made of glass.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.390
Not glass, my boy. Gold!
      You're made of solid gold.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.558
From your toes
       to your head, solid gold.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.328
- I don't feel any different.
 - But you're different.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.531
Everybody treats you with more
 courtesy and great respect.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.000
'And everybody wants
  something from you, right?'

13:23.069 --> 13:25.570
- Right! What do I do about it?
- You use it!

13:25.639 --> 13:28.640
The way any self respecting
  model millionaire, you use it.

13:28.708 --> 13:31.642
Power, my boy!
                 You are a king!

13:31.711 --> 13:34.245
- And I can get anything I want?
- Anything you want.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.281
- What do you want?
      - I'm not sure.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.449
But I think I want
an Abby Cake.

13:46.058 --> 13:49.726
I don't want power.
   I don't want to be a king.

13:49.795 --> 13:51.529
I don't want to be a king.

13:51.598 --> 13:55.066
I don't want power.
    I don't wanna be a king.

14:03.275 --> 14:05.276
Good morning, royal daddy.
   Good morning, royal mummy.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.378
- I'm going butterfly hunting.
 - No, you can't.

14:07.447 --> 14:10.247
Not until you seen
the morning list of supplicants.

14:10.316 --> 14:12.383
I don't like supplicants.
   I dislike supplicants.

14:12.452 --> 14:15.586
I hate supplicants.
     What are supplicants?

14:15.654 --> 14:17.822
Sit down, Gilligan,
   and be a good little king.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.256
I never have
        any fun anymore.

14:19.325 --> 14:21.625
Bring on the first supplicant.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.761
Your majesty, everyone in
   the kingdom wants your crown.

14:24.830 --> 14:26.264
They do?

14:29.335 --> 14:31.469
Hi, Mary Ann.
       You want my crown?

14:31.538 --> 14:32.670
Oh, your Highness,
              jest with me.

14:32.739 --> 14:34.404
No. You take
and you be king.

14:34.473 --> 14:36.373
- Oh, your Excellency, I cannot.
- Why not?

14:36.442 --> 14:39.577
- For one thing, I'm a girl.
  - I'm a boy. Does it matter?

14:39.645 --> 14:43.280
God, Queen mother. The king
is in need of higher education.

14:43.349 --> 14:46.350
- Take the crown and be king.
 - Oh, do not tease me so.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.819
I came but to ask you
           to grant me a farm.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.387
To raise butterflies?

14:50.456 --> 14:52.824
No, to provide sheep
            for the royal table.

14:52.893 --> 14:54.358
We don't need any sheep
for the royal table.

14:54.426 --> 14:56.093
We're already crowded
enough as it is.

14:56.162 --> 14:59.396
Ha ha. A good one,
       a jolly jest.

14:59.465 --> 15:01.399
Go away, Mary Ann.
       You're no fun.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.371
Your liege..

15:07.440 --> 15:09.673
Professor astronomer, you wanna
hunt butterflies with me?

15:09.742 --> 15:12.911
Later, my liege. Right now
there's much work to be done.

15:12.979 --> 15:14.578
'If you would grant
      the equipment I ask'

15:14.647 --> 15:17.315
'I would discover great marbles
in science for your kingdom.'

15:17.383 --> 15:19.550
Like what?

15:19.619 --> 15:23.121
Ah, Copernicus already has
the earth moving around the sun.

15:23.189 --> 15:25.122
Pythagoras has done
             the scale.

15:25.191 --> 15:28.125
'Oh! Here's something
          that needs discovery''

15:28.194 --> 15:29.460
Frozen foods.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.729
Now, how does that
       strike, my liege?

15:31.798 --> 15:33.064
Leaves me cold.

15:33.132 --> 15:35.766
Ha! Chip off the old scepter.
 Very good.

15:35.835 --> 15:37.435
Go away.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.008
- Your Highness.
        - I'm busy.

15:44.076 --> 15:45.710
Here goes one.

15:48.481 --> 15:49.714
Your majesty..

15:53.085 --> 15:54.351
- Your Highness.
        - Hm.

15:54.420 --> 15:56.420
All I want is,
             is one little dance

15:56.489 --> 15:58.989
with your royal
             masculine cuteness.

15:59.058 --> 16:02.726
One royal foxtrot
             or one royal waltz.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.462
Go away.
Girls are pests.

16:05.264 --> 16:07.432
There goes another one.

16:14.673 --> 16:17.741
Don't tell me. Let me guess.
You want a whole fleet of ships?

16:17.810 --> 16:21.012
Grant me that wish, sire!
  I shall sail for the orient.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.147
I shall bring you back
     rare pearls, gold

16:23.216 --> 16:25.149
frankincense for your treasures.

16:25.218 --> 16:28.319
I don't like gold,
   I don't like frankincense.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.454
I don't even like chow mien.

16:30.523 --> 16:33.291
All I want to do
   is hunt butterflies. Away.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.560
Wouldn't anybody play with me?

16:36.629 --> 16:37.962
(all)
             No!

16:38.031 --> 16:40.398
Alright then!
     Off with their heads.

16:40.466 --> 16:41.499
So be it!

16:44.837 --> 16:46.571
Bring on the guillotine.

16:46.639 --> 16:49.206
Oh! Stop, royal daddy.
     Stop, royal mummy.

16:49.275 --> 16:51.075
I-I didn't mean it.

16:53.479 --> 16:55.713
- We're doomed.
     - Oh, please spare us.

16:55.782 --> 16:58.582
No, stop. I won't hurt anybody.
I won't even hurt a butterfly.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.784
I wasn't even
     gonna catch him. Stop!

17:00.853 --> 17:02.319
It's too late, my dear.

17:02.388 --> 17:05.422
King's word is
       the royal command.

17:05.491 --> 17:09.260
No, no! I don't want to be king.
Really! I don't want to be king.

17:09.328 --> 17:12.596
I don't want to be king.
    I don't want to be king.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.332
I don't want to be king.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.667
But I don't want to be king.
  I don't want to be king.

17:17.736 --> 17:21.038
I don't want to be king.
    I don't want to be king.

17:21.106 --> 17:23.040
[panting]

17:42.662 --> 17:44.729
- Who's out here?
      - Just me, Skipper.

17:46.999 --> 17:50.034
Gilligan, what in the name of
 the seven seas are you doing?

17:50.102 --> 17:54.905
I don't want to be king. I don't
want to chop off your head.

17:54.974 --> 17:57.674
I can't be a Howell.
 I don't wanna disappoint you.

17:57.743 --> 18:00.511
I don't wanna be rich.
     I just want to be me.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.313
- Are you mad?
       - No, I'm not mad.

18:02.381 --> 18:04.382
Every man has
        the right to be himself.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.583
- Even a Gilligan.
       - Thanks, Skipper.

18:06.652 --> 18:09.119
- Have you told Howell's yet?
 - That's the problem. I can't.

18:09.188 --> 18:10.353
Why not?

18:10.422 --> 18:12.389
Because they did a lot for me.

18:12.458 --> 18:16.326
They believe thats what I am.
How do I tell, I'm not.

18:16.395 --> 18:19.330
First they broke the mould
      and then they made you.

18:19.398 --> 18:21.932
Skipper, I can't hurt
 their feelings no matter what.

18:22.001 --> 18:23.367
But you know little buddy

18:23.435 --> 18:25.536
inspite of yourself
   you still have to be king.

18:25.604 --> 18:27.471
But I think
               I have an answer.

18:27.540 --> 18:28.873
- You do?
          - Certainly.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.540
With a little bit of
            brain power

18:30.609 --> 18:33.143
I think I know exactly
          what to do.

18:33.212 --> 18:35.480
- What?
   - We'll ask the Professor.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.982
Yes, I think
       I have the answer.

18:39.051 --> 18:41.018
I told you
the Professor would know.

18:41.087 --> 18:43.187
You were right.
              What's the answer?

18:43.256 --> 18:45.189
When it comes to being tricky..

18:47.827 --> 18:49.160
...ask a woman.

18:49.228 --> 18:51.028
And you're willing to
     give up all that?

18:51.097 --> 18:53.297
So we can be friends
like we used to be.

18:53.365 --> 18:55.533
Oh, I think we all owe
          Gilligan a thanks.

18:55.602 --> 18:57.635
I think we should
       have his head examined.

18:57.704 --> 18:59.536
If that's what you want,
        Gilligan.

18:59.605 --> 19:01.438
- Hey, I got an idea.
     - Huh?

19:01.507 --> 19:02.473
Listen.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.281
I sure am excited.
              How do I look?

19:11.350 --> 19:13.050
Oh, you look wonderful,
I must say.

19:13.119 --> 19:16.420
You know your debut is gonna be
the social end of this season.

19:16.488 --> 19:19.390
Is the Mrs. Howell busy making
the last minute preparations?

19:19.458 --> 19:21.858
Dad, how much do
         I get for my allowance?

19:21.927 --> 19:23.227
I beg your pardon.

19:23.295 --> 19:25.929
Like all rich kids. How does
    10,000 month at cha?

19:25.998 --> 19:27.365
Ten thousand dollars a month?

19:27.433 --> 19:30.200
Well, that's more than
I give Mrs. Howell for her pi..

19:30.269 --> 19:32.102
Oh, we'll-we'll talk
about it later.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.404
Aloha.

19:34.473 --> 19:37.307
You know, I might need the money
for one thing or another.

19:37.376 --> 19:39.610
- Am I one thing, honey?
    - No, you're another.

19:39.678 --> 19:42.679
Promise to get 50 thou
for a new play when we get back.

19:42.748 --> 19:43.780
You do what?

19:43.849 --> 19:45.315
Ginger, we forgot
      the special dessert.

19:45.384 --> 19:47.484
O-o-oh, we'll be right back.

19:47.553 --> 19:50.488
I can pick up
  extra dough anytime I want.

19:52.058 --> 19:54.057
- Right, Skip?
         - Oh!

19:54.126 --> 19:57.227
- You're are definately chief.
 - We own the Minnow now.

19:57.296 --> 19:58.563
You own the Minnow?

19:58.631 --> 20:01.565
Yeah, won the old tub in
        the card game last night

20:01.634 --> 20:04.435
more or less you can judge
      a dumb kid by his cover.

20:04.503 --> 20:06.103
You're a real hustler.
     One of the greats.

20:06.172 --> 20:08.639
A Howell, a hustler?
      I may faint.

20:08.707 --> 20:12.876
Let me get you a stool there,
 dear dad.

20:12.945 --> 20:14.778
Ha ha, ace of spades, aye?

20:14.847 --> 20:17.347
'So, Howell IV,
       cheats at cards.'

20:17.416 --> 20:19.249
Oh, scandal of a shame.

20:19.318 --> 20:22.753
What do you have got to say
  for yourself, you low life?

20:22.822 --> 20:24.522
Nothing, us sea serpents
    can't talk.

20:24.590 --> 20:26.857
- Martinis, anyone?
   - Yes, I can use a drink.

20:26.926 --> 20:29.560
I'm frankly astonished at this
ghastly metamorphosis.

20:29.628 --> 20:31.829
Oh, never mind that.
      What about my boat?

20:31.898 --> 20:35.065
Keep it. See if I care.
My dad will buy me another one.

20:35.134 --> 20:38.535
- Won't you, dear old dad?
   - I could kill myself.

20:38.604 --> 20:41.805
I may climb up on top
   of my money and jump off.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.507
Gin..

20:43.575 --> 20:45.476
...and some vermouth.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.346
Yeah?

20:49.749 --> 20:51.248
There.

20:51.317 --> 20:54.885
- Now, here you are, Professor.
- Thank you.

20:54.954 --> 20:57.788
- Sensational, huh?
  - I'm afraid it's a bit dry.

20:57.857 --> 21:00.891
Are you telling me one of my
    perfect martinis is too dry?

21:00.960 --> 21:02.726
'Yes.'

21:02.795 --> 21:05.296
- 'We've been at it for years.'
- 'It's too dry.'

21:05.365 --> 21:07.063
(Gilligan)
     'You're insulting
     the family tradition.'

21:07.132 --> 21:09.833
Never mind that, Gilligan.
   Make him another drink.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.369
I will.

21:12.805 --> 21:15.072
He wants a nice,
                wet, Martini..

21:15.140 --> 21:19.075
I'll give him a nice, wet,
      Martini. Here we go.

21:19.144 --> 21:21.279
Nice, wet, Martini.

21:23.549 --> 21:25.750
Here you are,
                   Professor.

21:25.818 --> 21:28.985
Just the way you like it.
       Nice and wet.

21:29.054 --> 21:30.353
Oh, Gilligan.

21:30.422 --> 21:32.256
Buy him a new suit,
      dear old dad.

21:32.325 --> 21:33.957
Heavens, I've created
           a Frankenstein.

21:34.026 --> 21:36.527
Mr. Howell, I find
the behavior of your son

21:36.596 --> 21:38.061
and heir shocking
and disgraceful.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.463
Don't forget obnoxious.

21:39.532 --> 21:42.366
I may strike G
              Thurston Howell IV

21:42.435 --> 21:44.535
only in his mood
             he may strike back.

21:46.038 --> 21:50.007
Surprise! Surprise
for Gilligan's coming out party.

21:50.076 --> 21:51.841
Ginger specialty
     of coconut cream pie.

21:51.910 --> 21:54.311
We could use a pleasant
    moment right now.

21:54.380 --> 21:56.747
You brought me
a coconut cream pie?

21:56.816 --> 21:57.915
Yes, Gilligan.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.717
It was hard to make cream from
  coconut milk

21:59.785 --> 22:04.088
Don't you know my grandmother
fed me coconut cream all day?

22:04.157 --> 22:05.589
'Pretend it's Loganberry then.'

22:05.658 --> 22:07.892
But it's not Loganberry.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.627
- It's coconut cream.
     - Stop!

22:10.696 --> 22:13.030
Don't hit Ginger
        with that pie.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.366
I didn't.

22:16.435 --> 22:18.301
Excuse me, everyone.

22:18.370 --> 22:21.371
I would like a word
      with Gilligan.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.574
Don't you mean
G Thurston Howell IV?

22:23.642 --> 22:27.378
No, I mean, Gilligan!

22:34.654 --> 22:37.287
The name Howell
   has always stood for elan.

22:37.356 --> 22:40.491
Stood for style,
       noblesse, oblige.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.626
- Don't forget money.
     - Money means power.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.061
And with power comes

22:44.130 --> 22:46.062
responsibility in your
    behavior toward others.

22:46.131 --> 22:47.530
I sure miss the boat, huh?

22:47.599 --> 22:49.066
You're unbelievable!

22:49.135 --> 22:52.136
You're crude, you're rude,
   you're bullish.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.371
And don't forget obnoxious.
  I really was obnoxious.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.139
And don't forget
     dishonest and vulgar.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.308
You're very vulgar.

22:58.377 --> 23:01.312
Okay, Mr. Howell. You don't have
to say anymore. I understand.

23:01.381 --> 23:02.912
You don't wanna be
       my father anymore.

23:02.981 --> 23:04.814
I'm sorry, Gilligan.
      I-I really am.

23:04.883 --> 23:07.118
'And when we get back home,
  you'll be rewarded..'

23:07.186 --> 23:09.253
''Cause you just weren't
    cut out to be a Howell.'

23:09.322 --> 23:11.855
No hard feelings, boy.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.823
No, sir. I think
                you know best.

23:13.892 --> 23:16.060
[music]

23:23.702 --> 23:26.837
Oh, Thurston, couldn't you
give him one more chance?

23:26.906 --> 23:30.373
He didn't want one.
          That boy is all heart.

23:30.442 --> 23:32.143
Not a bad actor, either.

23:32.211 --> 23:34.478
- He's an actor?
        - Yes, my dear.

23:37.149 --> 23:38.949
[indistinct]

23:44.223 --> 23:47.824
Oh, Thurston, he really didn't
want to be a Howell, did he?

23:47.893 --> 23:50.694
No, it's incredible,
   he didn't want to be a Howell

23:50.762 --> 23:52.763
but he didn't want
            to hurt our feeling.

23:52.832 --> 23:55.199
You're a marvelous judge
of human nature, dear.

23:55.267 --> 23:58.435
Above all, I'm a Howell which is
synonymous with being astute

23:58.504 --> 24:01.238
generous, charming,
             kind and handsome.

24:01.306 --> 24:03.207
And above all, modest.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.748
It sure is nice to be wearing
 my old clothes again.

24:11.817 --> 24:14.018
It's nice having you
            back, little buddy.

24:14.086 --> 24:16.520
When I was G Thurston Howell IV
I had to be neat and clean.

24:16.589 --> 24:20.824
Oh, that must've been murder.
   Let me dirty you up a little.

24:20.893 --> 24:22.459
Thanks, Skipper.
Thanks.

24:22.528 --> 24:26.062
You know, not everyone
          can be a Howell.

24:26.131 --> 24:28.031
One question, who has a place
that not over the quick sand

24:28.100 --> 24:29.466
down by the spring.

24:29.535 --> 24:32.636
I did, Mr. Howell. They might
   forget about the quicksand.

24:32.704 --> 24:35.172
Well, you're quick thinking
saved Mrs. Howell's life.

24:35.241 --> 24:37.975
- That's great. You hear that?
 - What do you mean, Skipper?

24:38.043 --> 24:41.478
From now on,
it's S Thurston Howell V.

24:41.547 --> 24:43.413
- What?
      - You heard me, son!

24:43.482 --> 24:45.215
- Oh, but Mr. Howell--
     - Dad.

24:45.284 --> 24:47.051
- Oh, c'mon, Mr. Howell--
   - Dear old dad.

24:47.119 --> 24:50.621
- Please, Mr. Howell--
     - Dad, do you add.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.822
[indistinct]

24:52.891 --> 24:54.825
[music]

25:04.003 --> 25:05.202
¶ Now this is the tale
     of the castaways ¶

25:05.271 --> 25:07.070
¶ They're here
    for a long, long time ¶

25:07.139 --> 25:09.539
¶ They'll have to make
     the best of things ¶

25:09.608 --> 25:11.608
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

25:11.677 --> 25:13.744
¶ The first mate
     and the Skipper too ¶

25:13.813 --> 25:15.613
¶ Will do their very best ¶

25:15.681 --> 25:17.947
¶ To make the others
      comfortable ¶

25:18.016 --> 25:20.150
¶ In the tropic island nest ¶

25:20.219 --> 25:22.418
¶ No phone, no lights
     no motorcars ¶

25:22.487 --> 25:24.354
¶ Not a single luxury ¶

25:24.423 --> 25:26.623
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶

25:26.692 --> 25:28.826
¶ It's primitive as can be ¶

25:28.894 --> 25:31.094
¶ So join us here
     each week my friends ¶

25:31.163 --> 25:33.230
¶ You're sure to get a smile ¶

25:33.298 --> 25:35.599
¶ From seven
      stranded castaways ¶

25:35.668 --> 25:37.201
¶ Here on Gilligan's isle ¶
