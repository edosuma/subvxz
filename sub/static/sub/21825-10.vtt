Hey, guys.

04:07.482 --> 04:09.984
Thanks for coming.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.953
Harrison was a great guy.

04:12.987 --> 04:15.556
We met at camp
the summer after eighth grade

04:15.590 --> 04:17.157
when he gave me
the Heimlich maneuver

04:17.191 --> 04:20.094
after I accidentally swallowed
a wine cork.

04:20.127 --> 04:24.131
Harrison and I
went through a lot together.

04:25.299 --> 04:28.002
He was my best friend.

04:28.035 --> 04:31.171
And it's fitting
that his last name was Payne

04:31.205 --> 04:33.574
because he probably died
in a lot of it.

04:33.608 --> 04:36.511
Which is exactly the kind
of thing he would find funny,

04:36.544 --> 04:39.279
in case anyone was planning
on getting mad at me.

04:41.215 --> 04:44.151
Anyway...

04:44.184 --> 04:46.453
rest in peace, Harrison.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.660
Long enough.

End simulation.

05:30.397 --> 05:33.400
Alara, we know you're upset
about what happened.

05:33.433 --> 05:35.670
But we also know, as you should,

05:35.703 --> 05:37.805
that it's not your fault.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.139
Yes, it is.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.341
CLAIRE:
Not according to the autopsy.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.010
The first bulkhead
that collapsed

05:43.043 --> 05:45.079
caused massive
internal injuries.

05:45.112 --> 05:47.381
It's unlikely
he would have survived,

05:47.414 --> 05:50.585
and if you had gone in there,
you'd probably be dead, too.

05:50.618 --> 05:53.353
Well, we'll never know
'cause I didn't even try, so...

05:53.387 --> 05:55.189
You did try.

05:55.222 --> 05:56.891
It was just too late.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.993
And we could have lost
our chief of security, too.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.928
But we didn't because you made

06:00.961 --> 06:02.730
the responsible
command decision,

06:02.763 --> 06:04.498
no matter how hard it was.

06:04.531 --> 06:07.167
You don't understand. I froze.

What do you mean?

06:08.736 --> 06:10.104

06:10.137 --> 06:12.439
I was running towards him.

06:12.472 --> 06:14.241
I was gonna grab
the fallen bulkhead,

06:14.274 --> 06:16.243
but when the fire started,
I just... I froze.

06:16.276 --> 06:18.212
I have no idea why. I just...

06:18.245 --> 06:20.347
-I've never been so scared
in my life. I... -Okay,

06:20.380 --> 06:21.916
okay, I understand.

06:21.949 --> 06:24.184
But you're being too hard
on yourself.

06:24.218 --> 06:25.352

06:25.385 --> 06:28.288

probably have it harder.

06:30.991 --> 06:33.861
His parents.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.130
Oh, hey.
We have the simulator at 3:00.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.698
How much longer
are you guys gonna be?

06:37.732 --> 06:39.600
Just give us a minute, okay?

06:39.634 --> 06:41.135
-Oh, yeah. No, it's fine.
-Yeah.

06:41.168 --> 06:42.469
Why even have reservations?

06:46.440 --> 06:50.144
Alara, it might be helpful
for you to talk about this.

06:50.177 --> 06:53.113
Reset program.

06:53.147 --> 06:54.949
I don't think
this is a healthy way to...

06:54.982 --> 06:56.984
Get out. Please.

07:10.530 --> 07:13.167
Am I early?

07:19.874 --> 07:23.310
Uh, it's a little short

07:23.343 --> 07:25.579
I know. I suck at these things.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.247
I don't want
to make it sound too generic,

07:27.281 --> 07:29.349
but I hardly knew the man, so
I-I just got nothing to go on.

07:29.383 --> 07:30.617
Yeah, but look how you open it:

07:30.651 --> 07:33.320
"Dear Mr. and Mrs. Payne,
I'm deeply sorry

07:33.353 --> 07:34.421
"for your loss.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.356
Your son was such a neat guy."

07:36.390 --> 07:38.325
I mean, that's-that's terrible.

07:38.358 --> 07:39.493
I'm not a writer, okay?

07:39.526 --> 07:41.128
Yeah, well, w-why don't you say,

07:41.161 --> 07:43.798
"Your son was a brave
and accomplished man,"

07:43.831 --> 07:45.599
and then pull up
his personnel records

07:45.632 --> 07:47.134
and put his résumé
into sentences.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.703
Gordon, for God's sake,
the guy gave his life

07:48.736 --> 07:50.004
in the line of duty.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.371
Fine, go with "neat guy."

07:51.405 --> 07:53.173
He was a neat guy.

07:53.207 --> 07:55.309
-It's not like I'm making
that up. -(door chimes)

07:55.342 --> 07:56.376
Come in.

07:58.412 --> 08:00.647
Captain, may I speak with you?

08:00.681 --> 08:01.982
In private?

08:02.016 --> 08:04.218
Yeah, sure.
Um, Gordon, can you...

08:04.251 --> 08:06.286
-Go ask Kelly to write
the letter for you? -Yeah.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.387
Just have her do,
like, an outline,

08:07.421 --> 08:08.388
and then I can fill it in later.

08:08.422 --> 08:10.624
-On it.
-Thanks.

08:10.657 --> 08:11.692
Sorry, Lieutenant.

08:11.726 --> 08:12.993
What's on your mind?

08:13.027 --> 08:16.496
Captain, I would like to submit

08:16.530 --> 08:18.032
my official resignation.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.800
What?

08:19.834 --> 08:23.337
I am neither fit nor qualified
to be chief of security

08:23.370 --> 08:25.505

or any other starship.

08:25.539 --> 08:27.574
Look, I understand
you're feeling guilty

08:27.607 --> 08:29.176
-about the whole...
-Lieutenant Payne died

08:29.209 --> 08:31.311
because I was too afraid
to do my job.

08:31.345 --> 08:34.248
No, he died
because in a crisis situation,

08:34.281 --> 08:36.050
things happen
that you can't control.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.684
Payne knew the risks
of this uniform,

08:37.718 --> 08:39.319
-just like the rest of us.
-Captain, I could've moved

08:39.353 --> 08:41.188
that bulkhead with one arm.

08:41.221 --> 08:42.656
But I didn't.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.658
Because I was scared.

08:44.691 --> 08:48.262
Harrison is dead
because I was scared.

08:48.295 --> 08:51.065
People seem to think

08:51.098 --> 08:54.234
that being brave
means not being afraid.

08:54.268 --> 08:56.336
The way I see it,

08:56.370 --> 08:58.372
if you're not afraid, there's
nothing to be brave about.

08:58.405 --> 09:02.009
Tell that to Harrison's parents.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.244
You know, I remember

09:04.278 --> 09:08.348
the day I came aboard
the Orville and I met you,

09:08.382 --> 09:10.450
I was really skeptical.

09:10.484 --> 09:12.286
I thought to myself,

09:12.319 --> 09:15.022
"She's too young.
She's inexperienced.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.891
"There's no way
she can run a whole department,

09:16.924 --> 09:18.692
let alone security."

09:18.725 --> 09:21.261
Well, six months have passed,
and I'll tell you this:

09:21.295 --> 09:23.597
if I was being rushed
by an angry Moclan

09:23.630 --> 09:25.232
who wanted to kill me,

09:25.265 --> 09:29.103
the one person I would want
between him and me is you.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.271
I do not accept
your resignation.

09:31.305 --> 09:33.874
-Captain, you don't
understand... -Alara.

09:33.908 --> 09:36.977
What happened to you
could have happened to anyone.

09:37.011 --> 09:40.714
And it has happened
to many of us.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.716
But if this thing is really
gonna eat you alive inside,

09:42.749 --> 09:46.286
I would suggest doing
a little psychological digging.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.889
Find out why you were afraid
of the fire.

09:48.923 --> 09:50.124
Talk to Dr. Finn.

09:50.157 --> 09:51.892
Talk to your parents.

09:51.926 --> 09:53.493
Maybe they can offer
some insight.

09:53.527 --> 09:55.162
Take any time off you need,

09:55.195 --> 09:57.597
but you are still
my chief of security.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.233
I don't want anyone else.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.667
Hear me?

10:00.700 --> 10:02.736
Yes, Captain.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.138
Dismissed.

10:10.010 --> 10:13.313
Oh, sweetie, I am so very sorry
this has happened.

10:13.347 --> 10:15.582
-Thanks.
-The thing is,

10:15.615 --> 10:17.484
you knew this was a risk
when you decided

10:17.517 --> 10:19.954
to pursue such a...
physical line of work.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.355
I know.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.090
Maybe this is a sign.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.658
What do you mean?

10:24.691 --> 10:26.460
I mean that maybe it's time
to come home

10:26.493 --> 10:27.995
-and get your degree.
-Oh, God.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.796
Dad, don't start with that,
okay? Please.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.366
-Not now.
-I'm just saying it's possible.

10:32.399 --> 10:33.700
Just because
you're a little slow

10:33.733 --> 10:35.102
doesn't mean you can't get there

10:35.135 --> 10:36.136
if you work hard enough.

10:36.170 --> 10:37.771
A lot of intellectually
deficient people

10:37.804 --> 10:40.140
find a place
for themselves here.

10:40.174 --> 10:41.976
-That is the beauty of Xelayah.
-You know what?

10:42.009 --> 10:43.343
Can we just have
one conversation

10:43.377 --> 10:44.378
where you don't attack my choice

10:44.411 --> 10:45.712
to join the Fleet? Please?

10:45.745 --> 10:47.948
We just want
what's best for you,

10:47.982 --> 10:50.317
and we feel the military
is beneath you.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.953
It's what any parent
would say to their child.

10:52.987 --> 10:54.121
Any parent on Xelayah.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.956
You do realize
that there are planets

10:55.990 --> 10:58.292
where a military career
is a very honorable thing.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.127
The humans view it
with great respect.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.561
Well, yes, the humans.

11:01.595 --> 11:03.163
The hillbillies of the galaxy.

11:03.197 --> 11:05.199
Dad, can you just can it
for one second, please?

11:05.232 --> 11:07.401
That's not why I called.

11:07.434 --> 11:10.670
I need to know
why I got scared of that fire.

11:10.704 --> 11:12.206
Is there anything
you guys can think of,

11:12.239 --> 11:13.207
anything
that might have happened,

11:13.240 --> 11:14.841
maybe when I was a child?

11:14.875 --> 11:16.877
Actually, yes.

11:18.212 --> 11:20.080
It was late evening.

11:20.114 --> 11:23.650
Your father was attending
a symposium at the university,

11:23.683 --> 11:27.321
and I fell asleep in the living
room with you in my arms.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.257
You were less than
eight months old.

11:30.290 --> 11:31.926
The fire began in the kitchen

11:31.959 --> 11:34.828
and then spread
to the living room.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.596
They told us later
that it was due

11:36.630 --> 11:39.099
to a surge
in the power generator.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.568
It was your cries
that woke me up.

11:41.601 --> 11:46.573
Almost as if you were screaming
to me that we were in danger.

11:46.606 --> 11:49.109
The flames were all around us.

11:49.143 --> 11:52.279
I climbed out the window
and got us both to safety.

11:52.312 --> 11:56.250
And you never... thought
to mention this to me before?

11:56.283 --> 11:59.119
Honestly, the whole thing
upset me so much,

11:59.153 --> 12:01.688
I didn't like to talk about it.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.290
And you were a baby.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.292
You didn't even remember
it happening,

12:05.325 --> 12:07.227
so what would have been
the point?

12:07.261 --> 12:10.064
Oh, hey, settle
an argument for us:

12:10.097 --> 12:12.099
Do I look like
I've put on weight?

12:16.270 --> 12:18.272
(indistinct chatter)

12:41.328 --> 12:42.162
Wait!

13:11.291 --> 13:12.526
Captain.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.161
I need you to relieve me
of duty right now.

13:14.194 --> 13:16.130
Alara, we talked about this.
I thought...

13:16.163 --> 13:17.964
Just trust me, I am not well

13:17.998 --> 13:19.199
and I am going
to check myself in

13:19.233 --> 13:20.934
for psychiatric treatment
at the next Union outpost.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.269
But until then,

13:22.302 --> 13:23.603
I need to be confined
to sickbay.

13:23.637 --> 13:24.971
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.206
What makes you think
that you're not well?

13:27.407 --> 13:29.176
I just saw a clown on Deck C.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.178
What?

13:31.211 --> 13:33.013
-A clown?
-Mm-hmm.

13:33.047 --> 13:35.149
Like a... a clown clown?

13:35.182 --> 13:37.184
Yes! And when I chased him
down the hallway,

13:37.217 --> 13:38.385
he disappeared.

13:38.418 --> 13:39.819
I am obviously losing my mind.

13:39.853 --> 13:41.321
I don't like clowns.

13:41.355 --> 13:42.822
What is... a clown?

13:42.856 --> 13:44.624
Big red 'fro. Lots of makeup.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.026
Big ol' floppy shoes.

13:46.060 --> 13:47.327
Scary as balls.

13:47.361 --> 13:49.129
Wow, you're describing my mom.

13:49.163 --> 13:50.564
Did the clown speak?

13:50.597 --> 13:51.831
-No.
-Was it like a...

13:51.865 --> 13:53.167
circus clown

13:53.200 --> 13:54.368
or a hobo clown, or what?

13:54.401 --> 13:55.369
What's the difference?

13:55.402 --> 13:56.370
Hobo clowns are
the most dangerous,

13:56.403 --> 13:57.704
'cause they're hungry.

13:57.737 --> 14:00.207
Captain, I really need
to go to sickbay.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.177
You know, usually when someone
has the presence of mind

14:03.210 --> 14:05.212
to ask themselves
if they're going crazy,

14:05.245 --> 14:06.480
it suggests they're not.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.215
What are you saying?

14:08.248 --> 14:10.350
I'm saying,
let's check the security logs.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.689
Search Deck C logs, beginning
with time index 468.2--

14:15.722 --> 14:17.524
the past 30 minutes.

14:22.796 --> 14:23.830
I-I don't, I don't want to look.

14:23.863 --> 14:24.898
Wh-What do you see?

14:24.931 --> 14:26.200
I see the clown.

14:26.233 --> 14:29.103
Ah, damn it, man! No, man!
Come on.

14:29.136 --> 14:30.137
I don't believe it.

14:32.306 --> 14:33.707
Go to Deck C, section 4.

14:33.740 --> 14:34.941
Continuous time index.

14:38.478 --> 14:39.713
That's impossible.
There's no other outlet

14:39.746 --> 14:41.081
in that part of the corridor.

14:41.115 --> 14:42.849
It just... vanished.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.252
Then it was real.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.421
Could it be an alien life-form
of some kind?

14:47.454 --> 14:50.056
Internal scans confirm
that there was indeed

14:50.090 --> 14:52.526
an unidentified human
on Deck C at the time.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.194
What about now?

14:54.228 --> 14:55.729
Negative.

14:55.762 --> 14:58.632
Could he be...
hiding from the scans somehow?

14:58.665 --> 15:00.367
Only one way to find out.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.302
We'll divide into teams.

15:02.336 --> 15:04.971
Isaac will remain on the bridge
and continue to scan.

15:05.004 --> 15:06.473
All weapons are
to be kept on stun.

15:06.506 --> 15:07.907
We want the clown alive.

15:07.941 --> 15:09.309
-GORDON: Captain?
-Yeah.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.145
I think it's only prudent
to caution everyone

15:11.178 --> 15:12.546
to watch out for pies.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.748
At this point,
anything is possible, so yes.

15:14.781 --> 15:18.118
Pies, seltzer bottles,
balloon animals... be alert.

15:18.152 --> 15:19.919
All right, let's go.

15:19.953 --> 15:21.955
♪

15:24.291 --> 15:25.992
Check the cargo hold.

15:26.025 --> 15:28.162
The lieutenant and I will
search the shuttle bay.

15:44.878 --> 15:46.846
(keypad beeps)

15:46.880 --> 15:48.148
Lights on.

15:56.290 --> 15:58.158
Clown?

16:00.694 --> 16:02.462
I will check the upper level.

16:02.496 --> 16:03.897
All right.

16:32.392 --> 16:34.394
♪

16:41.601 --> 16:43.203
(footfall approaches)

16:59.419 --> 17:00.687
(clown whoops)

17:02.456 --> 17:03.457
(laughing wildly)

17:06.960 --> 17:08.228
(Alara grunts)

17:18.305 --> 17:19.105
(clown laughs wildly)

17:42.462 --> 17:44.063
I apologize, Captain.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.098
When he got ahold of my weapon,

17:45.131 --> 17:46.300
he turned the setting up
to kill.

17:46.333 --> 17:48.101
I didn't have time to lower it.

17:48.134 --> 17:50.270
It's all right,
better the clown than you.

17:50.304 --> 17:52.038
Isaac, do the scans
still read as human?

17:52.071 --> 17:53.307
-Yes, Captain.
-I'm telling you,

17:53.340 --> 17:55.141
there was nothing human
about this thing.

17:55.174 --> 17:56.810
I should've been able
to snap him like a twig,

17:56.843 --> 17:58.278
but he was strong.

17:58.312 --> 18:00.246
Those fangs...

18:00.280 --> 18:01.214
Vampire clown.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.116
Shut up.

18:03.149 --> 18:05.319
Captain, I recommend that we
take the ship to yellow alert.

18:05.352 --> 18:08.221
Until we know what the hell is
going on, that's a good idea.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.324
All right, notify the crew.

18:10.357 --> 18:11.825
There's nothing else
we can do right now,

18:11.858 --> 18:14.294
but in the meantime,
everyone stay on the lookout.

18:14.328 --> 18:15.595
For what?

18:15.629 --> 18:17.597
More clowns.

18:19.966 --> 18:22.936
I wish I could have captured
that stupid thing alive.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.738
Honestly,
I'm almost glad you didn't.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.507
I don't know if
I'd want to see it up close.

18:27.541 --> 18:30.176
Kelly...
what the hell is happening?

18:30.209 --> 18:31.778
I don't know.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.613
Everything in my gut
is telling me

18:33.647 --> 18:35.014
that we're dealing with
an alien presence,

18:35.048 --> 18:38.151
but the scans don't lie.

18:38.184 --> 18:40.119
Listen, I'm gonna
shower and change,

18:40.153 --> 18:41.921
but you feel like a drink
in the mess hall?

18:41.955 --> 18:43.990
Yes. A drink sounds amazing
right now.

18:44.023 --> 18:46.025
Okay. I'll meet you there in 20.

18:47.226 --> 18:48.828
(keypad beeping)

18:48.862 --> 18:50.163
(gasps)

18:50.196 --> 18:51.998
(Kelly screams)

18:52.031 --> 18:53.166
Alara!

18:55.201 --> 18:57.337
Alara, help me!

19:00.173 --> 19:01.307
(Kelly shrieks)

19:01.341 --> 19:03.610
Aah!

19:03.643 --> 19:05.879
(panting)

19:05.912 --> 19:07.481
What in God's name was that?

19:07.514 --> 19:09.849
I don't know.

19:12.251 --> 19:13.787
Were you able to get any scans?

19:13.820 --> 19:15.288
No, sir. I was just trying

19:15.321 --> 19:16.456
to get the commander
out of there alive.

19:16.490 --> 19:18.658
Ed, what we saw was like
looking into infinity.

19:18.692 --> 19:19.993
It's impossible.

19:20.026 --> 19:21.160
It defies every law of physics.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.196
Well, if it's impossible,

19:23.229 --> 19:25.031
then it doesn't really exist.

19:25.064 --> 19:26.500
And if that's the case...

19:26.533 --> 19:28.735
there's something wrong with us.

19:31.237 --> 19:32.171
You both saw it.

19:32.205 --> 19:33.206
Saw it. Felt it.

19:33.239 --> 19:34.708
Almost got swallowed up by it.

19:34.741 --> 19:37.711
Doctor, these things
cannot possibly be real.

19:37.744 --> 19:39.913
Is there a chance we're dealing
with some kind of...

19:39.946 --> 19:41.848
collective insanity?

19:41.881 --> 19:43.717
A... a brain virus of some sort?

19:43.750 --> 19:46.185
Could somebody have put peyote
in the food synthesizers?

19:46.219 --> 19:47.854
Maybe we're all just
really stoned.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.556
Well, you all saw the clown.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.090
On the monitor, at least.

19:51.124 --> 19:52.859
But so far, only two of you

19:52.892 --> 19:54.728
have had direct
physical experiences.

19:57.731 --> 20:01.000
There is an alligator
in the cargo bay.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.102
I successfully crushed it
with a chair.

20:03.136 --> 20:04.203
Where did it come from?

20:04.237 --> 20:05.505
I do not know.

20:05.539 --> 20:07.607
Regardless, it is crushed.

20:07.641 --> 20:09.275
Doctor?

20:09.308 --> 20:11.044
All right.
I'll do a brain scan

20:11.077 --> 20:12.646
on each of you, just to be safe.

20:14.113 --> 20:15.381
Take off your jacket
and lie down.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.417
This will take about 20 minutes.

20:20.887 --> 20:21.855
Okay?

20:21.888 --> 20:22.922
Comfortable?

20:22.956 --> 20:24.057
Yeah.

20:24.090 --> 20:25.324
Good.

20:26.760 --> 20:28.361
Where's... where's your staff?

20:28.394 --> 20:30.196
Everyone's at lunch.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.565
All at once?

20:31.598 --> 20:33.299
What if there's an emergency?

20:38.237 --> 20:39.205
Doctor?

20:39.238 --> 20:40.373
Yes?

20:40.406 --> 20:42.275
What are the restraints for?

20:42.308 --> 20:45.211
The brain scan requires
a high degree of precision.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.581
It's easily affected
by the smallest movement.

20:47.614 --> 20:48.882
I just want to make sure
you lie still.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.718
I will.
You don't need to strap me down.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.521
Hey, who's the doctor here?

20:57.457 --> 20:59.726
(grunts)

20:59.759 --> 21:01.227
You're wondering why
you can't break free, right?

21:01.260 --> 21:03.329
Super-strong Alara Kitan

21:03.362 --> 21:05.298
can't bust through
those restraints.

21:05.331 --> 21:08.234
I had them quadruple-fortified
just for you.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.235
Why?

21:09.268 --> 21:10.737
-I'll be right back.
-What?

21:10.770 --> 21:12.271
I just need
to get my instruments.

21:12.305 --> 21:13.306
What?

21:14.340 --> 21:15.875
(grunts)

21:18.377 --> 21:19.579
Hey, Lieutenant.

21:19.613 --> 21:22.148
Oh, Nurse Park.

21:22.181 --> 21:23.483
Can you unlock these restraints?

21:23.517 --> 21:24.684
Why are you in restraints?

21:24.718 --> 21:25.785
Dr. Finn said I needed them

21:25.819 --> 21:26.953
for the brain scan.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.087
That doesn't make any sense.

21:28.121 --> 21:30.023
Something's not right.
Get me loose.

21:32.726 --> 21:34.761
-I don't-- I don't
understand this. -What?

21:34.794 --> 21:35.929
She must've changed the code.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.097
Why on earth would she...

21:38.131 --> 21:39.298
ALARA:
Claire!

21:39.332 --> 21:41.134
Oh, my God, what are you doing?

21:45.004 --> 21:46.640
Surgery.

21:57.350 --> 21:58.518
Claire, what the hell
is wrong with you?

21:58.552 --> 22:00.053
I understand
what you're feeling.

22:00.086 --> 22:02.321
Nobody likes
going to the doctor.

22:02.355 --> 22:04.057
But I'm here to make you better.

22:04.090 --> 22:05.191
What? What are you doing?

22:05.224 --> 22:06.960
The best way
to get accurate results

22:06.993 --> 22:09.328
with a brain examination

22:09.362 --> 22:12.131
is to go in through the abdomen,
up through the chest,

22:12.165 --> 22:13.667
-and through the base
of the skull. -No.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.301
No, Claire, this is insane.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.970
Something's happened to you.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.172
Just think for one second.

22:21.575 --> 22:23.009
Help!

22:23.042 --> 22:24.811
Someone help me!

22:24.844 --> 22:25.845
(grunts)

22:30.917 --> 22:32.318
(panting)

22:32.351 --> 22:33.319
Alara to Bortus.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.755
Request security detail
immediately.

22:38.758 --> 22:41.527
ED:
I'll ask you one more time.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.429
Why did you kill Nurse Park?

22:43.462 --> 22:45.264
Why did you try to kill Alara?

22:45.298 --> 22:47.867
Why not?

22:49.636 --> 22:52.405
Look, Dr. Finn,
you're obviously not yourself.

22:52.438 --> 22:54.240
But if you ever want to see
the outside of that cell,

22:54.273 --> 22:56.009
you'll tell us
what the hell is going on.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.577
Did anything happen to you
that you can recall

22:57.611 --> 22:59.245
prior to the killing?

22:59.278 --> 23:01.080
Anything strange?
Did you see or feel

23:01.114 --> 23:04.383
-anything out of the ordinary?
-I'm hungry.

23:06.119 --> 23:08.622
Will somebody get me a pizza?

23:08.655 --> 23:10.757
What kind of pizza?

23:10.790 --> 23:12.125
No, she's not getting a pizza.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.260
All right. Why don't you call us

23:14.293 --> 23:17.230
-when you're prepared to talk.
-Captain.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.101
Do you ever sit in your quarters

23:22.135 --> 23:24.437
and look out the window?

23:24.470 --> 23:26.906
Do you ever stop and watch

23:26.940 --> 23:30.209
the darkness out there?

23:30.243 --> 23:33.112
It's very, very dark in space.

23:34.981 --> 23:37.350
Looks so empty.

23:39.986 --> 23:43.256
But there are terrors
lurking all around us

23:43.289 --> 23:46.559
in the infinite shadows.

23:46.592 --> 23:48.561
You can't see them,

23:48.594 --> 23:51.264
but they're there.

23:51.297 --> 23:53.166
If you are attempting
to frighten us,

23:53.199 --> 23:54.233
you have failed.

23:54.267 --> 23:55.969
What are you talking about?

23:58.972 --> 24:02.541
You have no idea...

24:09.315 --> 24:11.317
...what's coming for you.

24:14.453 --> 24:17.356
(laughing)

24:31.004 --> 24:32.972
All right, I need answers,
and I need them now.

24:33.006 --> 24:34.774
What the hell is happening
on this ship?

24:34.808 --> 24:37.143
Scans show no record
of the vortex

24:37.176 --> 24:39.012
Commander Grayson encountered,

24:39.045 --> 24:40.113
nor were there
any anomalous readings

24:40.146 --> 24:41.948
in or around sickbay.

24:41.981 --> 24:42.982
That's not good enough.

24:43.016 --> 24:44.350
We have clowns,
we have bottomless pits,

24:44.383 --> 24:47.153
and our chief medical officer
has lost her mind.

24:47.186 --> 24:49.355
Wait, what if we all died
in that plasma storm

24:49.388 --> 24:50.724
and this is actually

24:50.757 --> 24:52.158
some kind of purgatory?

24:52.191 --> 24:53.526
How would we know
we were in purgatory?

24:53.559 --> 24:54.994
What's purgatory even like?

24:55.028 --> 24:56.696
-You ever been married?
-No.

24:56.730 --> 24:58.564
-It's like that.
-Wait.

24:58.597 --> 25:00.499
Isaac, what about
the plasma storm?

25:00.533 --> 25:01.968
Is it possible
that it affected us

25:02.001 --> 25:03.870
or the ship in some way?

25:03.903 --> 25:05.238
How so, Commander?

25:05.271 --> 25:07.240
I'm not sure.

25:07.273 --> 25:09.242
This is gonna sound
like I'm talking out of my ass.

25:09.275 --> 25:11.144
Then please try to enunciate.

25:11.177 --> 25:14.313
No, it's a figure...
Never mind.

25:14.347 --> 25:16.883
Is it possible
that the damage to the ship

25:16.916 --> 25:18.151
was more than just structural?

25:18.184 --> 25:19.585
Could the storm have...

25:19.618 --> 25:20.887
frayed some boundary

25:20.920 --> 25:23.189
between reality
and something else?

25:23.222 --> 25:24.557
Thoughts, maybe?

25:24.590 --> 25:26.392
Your ass
might be on to something.

25:26.425 --> 25:28.161
An interesting hypothesis.

25:28.194 --> 25:30.396
I suppose it is not impossible.

25:30.429 --> 25:32.598
Was anyone thinking about clowns

25:32.631 --> 25:34.600
or bottomless pits
before you saw them?

25:36.235 --> 25:39.038
Captain.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.107
Where'd that come from?

25:50.283 --> 25:52.385
Oh, my God.

25:52.418 --> 25:54.220
They cannot be real.

25:55.654 --> 25:58.091
(screams)
Get it off!

25:58.124 --> 26:00.059
Get it off! Get it off!

26:00.093 --> 26:01.160
Get it off!

26:10.403 --> 26:12.906
What the hell?

26:18.144 --> 26:21.247
Isaac, how much of a risk
would it pose to the ship

26:21.280 --> 26:22.882
to reenter the plasma storm?

26:22.916 --> 26:24.483
There is considerable risk,
Captain.

26:24.517 --> 26:26.285
It's the only lead
we have right now.

26:26.319 --> 26:28.287
And it might provide a clue
to what's going on.

26:28.321 --> 26:30.323
That storm nearly totaled
the engineering deck.

26:30.356 --> 26:33.392
Perhaps we could fortify
the deflectors in some fashion.

26:33.426 --> 26:35.294
Scanner log data
could give us a frequency window

26:35.328 --> 26:36.562
for the plasma charges.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.097
We could modulate the deflectors

26:38.131 --> 26:39.465
to provide better protection.

26:39.498 --> 26:41.300
However, it would not last long.

26:41.334 --> 26:43.569
We have crew members
trying to murder each other.

26:43.602 --> 26:44.838
All right, let's do it.

26:44.871 --> 26:46.439
Alara, you and Gordon
report to engineering

26:46.472 --> 26:47.907
and help Chief Newton
get working

26:47.941 --> 26:49.175
on the deflectors.

26:49.208 --> 26:50.576
John, set a course
back to the plasma storm.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.846
Push quantum drive to the limit
without breaking the ship apart.

26:52.879 --> 26:54.747
Will do, Captain.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.449
From this point forward,
I want everyone to carry weapons

26:56.482 --> 26:57.783
at all times.

26:57.817 --> 27:00.186
All right. Let's go.

27:02.288 --> 27:05.091
You know,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.625
I'm pretty scared.

27:06.659 --> 27:07.994
Join the club.

27:08.027 --> 27:09.528
That spider was real.

27:09.562 --> 27:13.166
I could feel its hairy stomach
on my face.

27:13.199 --> 27:16.002
Oh, my God. What-what if it
laid an egg in my nose

27:16.035 --> 27:18.171
and then my head swells up
with a big egg sac

27:18.204 --> 27:20.106
and then it explodes
and all these baby spiders

27:20.139 --> 27:21.174
come rushing out of my brain?

27:21.207 --> 27:22.541
Gordon, just don't think
about it, okay?

27:22.575 --> 27:24.543
Just let's focus on our jobs.

27:24.577 --> 27:26.145
You're right.
If we start to panic,

27:26.179 --> 27:27.280
we're in big trouble.

27:27.313 --> 27:29.182
Believe me, I know.

27:30.583 --> 27:32.518
Oh, hey, Alara,
I didn't mean it like that.

27:32.551 --> 27:34.153
I'm sorry. I...

27:34.187 --> 27:35.955
I'm just a little freaked out,
you know?

27:35.989 --> 27:38.291
No, it's okay. I know.
I am, too.

27:38.324 --> 27:41.961
Look, I know everybody's
been telling you this,

27:41.995 --> 27:44.697
but you know
it wasn't your fault, right?

27:48.234 --> 27:49.668
(shrieks)

27:56.242 --> 27:57.576
What do we do?!

27:57.610 --> 27:59.745
Run!

27:59.778 --> 28:02.248
(shrieking)

28:04.683 --> 28:07.220
Okay, I quit. I quit right now.

28:07.253 --> 28:08.922
I cannot work here anymore!

Gordon is dead.

29:05.979 --> 29:08.147
Kitan to bridge. Do you read?

29:26.332 --> 29:29.035
Kitan to engineering.
Do you read me?

29:31.004 --> 29:33.806
If anyone can hear me,
there's nobody on the bridge,

29:33.839 --> 29:35.141
and we are approaching
the plasma storm.

29:35.174 --> 29:38.711
I need to know
if the deflectors are ready.

29:40.713 --> 29:42.615
Can anyone hear me?

29:42.648 --> 29:45.384

I've been all over the ship.
It's completely deserted.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.038
Yes. I was on the bridge,

31:46.071 --> 31:47.406

found myself alone.

31:47.440 --> 31:49.208
I came down to engineering

31:49.242 --> 31:51.210

I would estimate
approximately four minutes.

32:58.377 --> 33:00.213
I only told you he was dead.

33:00.246 --> 33:02.615
How did you know
about the creature?

33:02.648 --> 33:04.116
We do not have much time.

directive 38 in the execution

35:45.378 --> 35:47.513
No bare feet

35:54.152 --> 35:55.488
What does that mean?

35:55.521 --> 35:57.189
It's an extreme
crisis-only regulation

35:57.222 --> 35:59.191
that allows the chief of
security on board a starship

35:59.224 --> 36:01.394
the ability to override
all other clearance.

-What in God's name for?

36:03.662 --> 36:05.798
In the rare case that the
captain has been compromised

39:06.679 --> 39:08.413
No.

Isaac create a simulation

39:18.724 --> 39:21.226

any additional fears

39:21.259 --> 39:23.095

39:52.257 --> 39:53.692
the fear wouldn't be real.

39:53.726 --> 39:56.128
So you needed a short-term
memory wipe

39:56.161 --> 39:58.296
to erase any knowledge
of the request.

39:58.330 --> 40:02.200
It's a risky procedure, but you
told me it was essential

40:02.234 --> 40:05.103
for the protection
of classified security material.

40:05.137 --> 40:08.106
I ought to write you up
for lying to a medical officer.

40:08.140 --> 40:10.709
Wait... so who's afraid
of clowns?

40:10.743 --> 40:11.877
That's me.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.245
You really are afraid of clowns?

40:13.278 --> 40:15.313
Yes. Please stop saying
the "C" word.

40:15.347 --> 40:18.150
-And the abyss?
-Heights. My phobia.

40:18.183 --> 40:20.485
-What about the sickbay mess?
-That's me.

40:20.518 --> 40:21.887
Scared to death of surgery.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.221
I had a skin tag removed once--

40:23.255 --> 40:24.957
total panic attack.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.158
The spiders came from me.

40:26.191 --> 40:27.893
I'm a bit of an arachnophobe.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.828
ISAAC:
Commander Grayson cited a fear

40:29.862 --> 40:33.465
of isolation, with which
I conceived the empty ship.

40:33.498 --> 40:35.834
That just leaves crazy,
psycho Isaac.

40:35.868 --> 40:38.103
You can thank Bortus
for that one.

40:38.136 --> 40:41.106
Fear of being conquered
by a superior enemy.

40:41.139 --> 40:43.308
I am feeling
very self-conscious.

40:43.341 --> 40:45.243
May I leave?

40:45.277 --> 40:46.679
Uh, sure.

40:48.280 --> 40:52.117
Isaac, I-I guess
I should say thank you.

40:52.150 --> 40:55.520
You made it an order,
Lieutenant, I had no choice.

40:55.553 --> 40:58.256
Alara, you invoked directive 38
to prevent us

40:58.290 --> 41:00.292
from shutting down the program
when it got too hot in there.

41:00.325 --> 41:02.160
I ought to court-martial you
on this very spot

41:02.194 --> 41:03.829
for the position you put us in.

41:03.862 --> 41:05.197
We were really worried
about you.

41:05.230 --> 41:06.832
Captain, I am so sorry.

41:06.865 --> 41:08.133
I mean, I don't...
I don't remember it,

41:08.166 --> 41:11.136
but still, I'm sorry.

41:11.169 --> 41:14.172
I'm letting it slide because
no one got hurt.

41:14.206 --> 41:17.776
And also because you owned

41:17.810 --> 41:19.477
every crisis
Isaac threw at you.

41:19.511 --> 41:22.514
Every insane situation
you were up against,

41:22.547 --> 41:25.150
you handled like
a first-rate officer.

41:25.183 --> 41:26.785
There should be no doubt
in your mind

41:26.819 --> 41:28.353
that you are capable
of doing your job.

41:33.158 --> 41:34.426
See you in the morning.

41:39.364 --> 41:40.966
(sighs)

41:40.999 --> 41:43.001
(door whooshes shut)

42:15.801 --> 42:17.803
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

43:00.745 --> 43:02.647
You've explored space
with The Orville.
