Alex, the best thing
you can do right now

17:38.700 --> 17:40.700
is answer some questions, OK?

17:47.820 --> 17:49.820
What was Eddie wearing
the last time you saw him?

17:49.820 --> 17:53.660
A yellow-and-grey singlet.
Maroon footy shorts.

17:53.660 --> 17:53.900
A yellow-and-grey singlet.
I told him to put on a good shirt.

17:53.900 --> 17:56.260
I told him to put on a good shirt.

17:56.260 --> 17:56.500

We're working through it.

Is there a chance that Eddie
put that noose up there himself?

We're not suggesting anything
at this stage.

put that thing up, alright?

was a noose in your yard?

of these ongoing threats,

20:06.660 --> 20:09.580
there are grounds to issue

about Eddie.

21:34.860 --> 21:36.900
That Alex Irving
