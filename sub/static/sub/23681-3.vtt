WEBVTT

00:07.041 --> 00:09.477
- I felt I needed to
see how you were.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.479
You'll feel better
if you eat something.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.047
- Let me see!
- Ahh!

00:13.081 --> 00:14.248
- Zoey, what did you do
to your leg?

00:14.282 --> 00:16.184
- There was a homicide
in the precinct.

00:16.217 --> 00:18.452
Pops, what the hell
is going on?

00:18.486 --> 00:20.588
I saw my dad's men
set a murderer free.

00:20.621 --> 00:23.191
- Those people--the Peaches--
are suddenly

00:23.224 --> 00:25.159
very interested in Alice
and her sister.

00:25.193 --> 00:27.095
- He went inside of my head.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.562
I think he woke something up.

00:28.596 --> 00:31.499
- Mr. Schizophrenia.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.501
- [giggling]

00:33.534 --> 00:35.269
- Oh.

00:35.303 --> 00:36.437
[knife slices]
Ahh!

00:36.470 --> 00:38.506
[gunshot]
- [gasps]

00:40.408 --> 00:42.176
- Your sister suffered
a psychotic break.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.178
- I just wanna know
if this is gonna happen to me.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.315
- There's a place for you
at our table

00:47.348 --> 00:49.283
and there is a room for you
in our home.

00:49.317 --> 00:50.551
- Is that where the stairs
lead to?

00:50.584 --> 00:53.554
[eerie music]

00:53.587 --> 01:00.628

01:12.740 --> 01:15.543
[door creaks, shuts]

01:18.446 --> 01:20.614
- [chuckles]
- Because it's so muggy outside

01:20.648 --> 01:22.650
that we're about
to get rained on heat.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.485
Ooh, you better go shopping
right before

01:24.518 --> 01:25.519
you're about to get rained on.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.121
- [laughs]
- Oh.

01:27.155 --> 01:29.157
- Hi, girls.
- Hi, Nestor.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.558
- Muggy today.
- Yeah, but the flowers

01:30.591 --> 01:32.226
look great.

01:32.260 --> 01:34.562
[chuckles]
- Alice.

01:37.698 --> 01:40.201
I'm just thinking of you.
- What?

01:40.234 --> 01:42.236
Zoey, stop being weird.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.538
- Let's go.

01:54.248 --> 01:57.218
[light music]

01:57.251 --> 02:04.325
*

02:05.693 --> 02:07.695

02:43.631 --> 02:46.667
[indistinct, eerie voices]

02:54.708 --> 02:57.678
[eerie music]

02:57.711 --> 03:04.752

03:17.365 --> 03:19.400
[turns engine off]

03:43.591 --> 03:46.627
[low rumbling]

03:53.701 --> 03:55.403
- Luke...

03:55.436 --> 03:57.505
when I said you could
bring him to my house,

03:57.538 --> 04:00.641
this is not what I meant.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.610
- Yeah. We need to make a plan.

04:02.643 --> 04:05.579
- We?

04:05.613 --> 04:07.648
- You can help me or not.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.685
- [sighs]

04:22.563 --> 04:26.534
Cannot believe I let you
get me into this.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.436
- Is it--I would--me?

04:28.469 --> 04:29.670
Are you kidding?

04:29.703 --> 04:32.573
Oh, come on. That is--

04:32.606 --> 04:35.609
Stop pretending like
I got you into this, okay?

04:35.643 --> 04:38.412
You already were in this.

04:38.446 --> 04:40.914
You know, this is what
you've been waiting for, right?

04:40.948 --> 04:43.717
Answers to all those questions.

04:50.424 --> 04:53.394
[light music]

04:53.427 --> 05:00.468
*

05:20.921 --> 05:22.890
- [sighs]

05:22.923 --> 05:29.963
*

05:50.918 --> 05:53.587
Ah, ooh, ahh, ahh!

05:53.621 --> 05:55.423
[screams]

05:55.456 --> 05:58.759
- Stop running around
like a crazy rabbit.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.931
- I was wondering
when you would show up.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.634
What is this place?

06:06.667 --> 06:08.469
- It's the summer house.

06:08.502 --> 06:11.439
- What's the summer house?
- Our little plantation

06:11.472 --> 06:13.841
on top of the food chain.

06:17.845 --> 06:20.948
[gurgling, heart beating]

06:24.885 --> 06:26.420
Call it...

06:26.454 --> 06:29.723
custom made by request.

06:29.757 --> 06:32.993
Although, the landlord
is a bit of a prick.

06:33.026 --> 06:36.630
Uh--

06:36.664 --> 06:41.735
There you go.
We had...

06:41.769 --> 06:45.706
such high hopes for this.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.945
- I just wanna find my sister,
take her home.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.046
Where is she?

06:53.080 --> 06:55.516
- She's at the house.

06:55.549 --> 06:56.950
- I can't get there.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.819
Can you take me?
- No.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.021
You have to go there
by yourself.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.857
And it's harder than you think.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.929
- Fine.

07:11.732 --> 07:14.468
- [sighs]

07:17.004 --> 07:19.973
[eerie music]

07:20.007 --> 07:26.013
*

07:27.014 --> 07:28.616
- Mother, how much longer
are they gonna

07:28.649 --> 07:30.050
rip people off of us?

07:30.083 --> 07:32.786
This tray they brought over,
this tray is--

07:32.820 --> 07:36.490
let's not kid ourselves.
- Truly, stop it.

07:36.524 --> 07:37.725
- Are they gonna beg her
and take her

07:37.758 --> 07:38.759
because of the bone
on the plate?

07:38.792 --> 07:40.894
both: No.

07:45.633 --> 07:50.003
- [laughs] Always tires me out,
gettin' around.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.739
Oh, hi.

07:51.772 --> 07:55.008
Sorry I'm late.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.077
Hi.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.727
Whoo. [laughs]

08:13.761 --> 08:16.997
This house is a lot bigger
than it looks on the outside.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.833
- [stomach rumbles]

08:19.867 --> 08:22.102
- Oh, you're hungry,
aren't you?

08:24.938 --> 08:28.676
Me, personally, I--I can't
sleep on a full stomach.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.779
That's why lunch
is my favorite meal of the day.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.681
Eat and eat and eat
and I still have time

08:33.714 --> 08:35.048
to digest before bedtime.

08:35.082 --> 08:36.917
Sleep easy, no nightmares.

08:36.950 --> 08:40.854
- Oh, I'm not--

08:40.888 --> 08:42.756
I'm not hungry.

08:42.790 --> 08:44.124
- Oh, hon, you can
tell yourself that,

08:44.157 --> 08:47.628
but I can hear your stomach
grumblin' from here.

08:47.661 --> 08:48.962
- Where's Robert?

08:48.996 --> 08:51.932
He's been downstairs
since yesterday.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.101
It's not like your brother
to miss lunch.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.737
- He gets up to
no good down there.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.839
You know Robert.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.741
He's not careful.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.209
- I know my son.

09:02.242 --> 09:04.044
- Do you, Mother?

09:04.077 --> 09:07.114
And do you ever imagine
that despite all the attention

09:07.147 --> 09:09.950
that you give him,
maybe you don't know

09:09.983 --> 09:13.120
what Robert gets up to.
- Now, you're just being petty.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.626
- Lunch is here.
[laughs]

09:18.659 --> 09:21.862
Okay, settle down now.

09:34.074 --> 09:37.711
- So what do you plan
to do with the body?

09:37.745 --> 09:38.979
- Yeah, I still gotta
figure that out.

09:39.012 --> 09:41.815
- [chuckles] Well, you need to
figure fast.

09:41.849 --> 09:44.685
I got a dead Peach
in my basement,

09:44.718 --> 09:46.987
and it ain't gonna keep.

09:54.762 --> 09:57.230
- Mother Peach loves Robert.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.066
- It bothers Aldus to no end

09:59.099 --> 10:03.036
that Robert's
her favorite Peach.

10:03.070 --> 10:06.006
Robert is the best Peach
of 'em all, though.

10:06.039 --> 10:08.108
He rescued me from
the secretarial pool

10:08.141 --> 10:09.943
down at Burkett Insurance
Company in Georgia--

10:09.977 --> 10:11.779
that's where I'm from.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.682
Robert was down on a visit,
right,

10:14.715 --> 10:16.249
and he walked in one morning

10:16.283 --> 10:20.053
and I was just sitting there,
typing away and--

10:20.087 --> 10:21.722
and he nodded at the door.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.891
And I said...

10:23.924 --> 10:26.727
"Sir, what are you suggesting?"

10:26.760 --> 10:30.297
And he said, "I'm suggesting
you follow me out that door

10:30.330 --> 10:34.001
and I make you
a Georgia Peach." [laughs]

10:34.034 --> 10:36.970
And that's exactly what I did.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.772
I followed him out
and in time,

10:38.806 --> 10:41.008
I followed him up here.

10:46.079 --> 10:48.682
- Ha! [claps]

10:50.851 --> 10:53.286
- Truth is, I'd follow Robert
anywhere.

10:56.824 --> 10:59.226
Actually, can I get one more?

11:02.963 --> 11:05.198
[sighs] It's like every day
is Easter around here,

11:05.232 --> 11:06.800
you know? [chuckles]

11:06.834 --> 11:08.135
oh.
- [clears throat]

11:08.168 --> 11:12.072
[eerie music]

11:12.105 --> 11:14.107
- Go on, eat, honey.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.912
- Where the fuck did he go?

11:24.852 --> 11:27.755
- Okay.

11:27.788 --> 11:30.924
Well, he couldn't have
gone far

11:30.958 --> 11:33.360
in his condition.

11:33.393 --> 11:36.997
- Yeah, his condition was dead.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.970
What's in there?

11:43.003 --> 11:45.205
- Bootleggers build the house,
there's all tunnels,

11:45.238 --> 11:47.174
but they're boarded up.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.342

Oh! [screams]

12:55.142 --> 12:57.144
- Ahh!

12:57.177 --> 13:00.413
- [whimpering]

13:04.217 --> 13:06.854
Ahh, ahh.

13:06.887 --> 13:07.855
- Mouse!

13:07.888 --> 13:10.257
- Ahh! Stay down!

13:10.290 --> 13:13.226
Uh! Uhh!

13:13.260 --> 13:15.295
[crunching]

13:19.900 --> 13:21.134
How do we make him
stay dead?

13:21.168 --> 13:23.203
- [panting]

13:24.371 --> 13:26.339
- [sighs]

[light, eerie music]

13:29.376 --> 13:35.082

13:35.115 --> 13:38.018
- Oh.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.209
- You're new here.

14:02.242 --> 14:05.278
- Um, yeah, I am.
But I'm not staying long.

14:05.312 --> 14:08.348
- Good. The landlord's
a bit of a prick.

14:08.381 --> 14:11.284
You've brought
someone else with you.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.453
A secret companion.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.355
- No.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.891
I'm looking for someone.

14:17.925 --> 14:20.994
- I'm often shut,
but I'm not a mouth.

14:21.028 --> 14:24.965
Sometimes I break--
- Is this a riddle?

14:24.998 --> 14:27.167
- Do you want me to help you?

14:29.436 --> 14:33.373
I'm often shut,
but I'm not a mouth.

14:33.406 --> 14:36.243
Sometimes I break,
but I'm not a heart.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.278
When I am pained,
I do not feel it.

14:38.311 --> 14:42.015
When I am stained,
I'm not unclean.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.051
What am I?

14:48.088 --> 14:49.122
[eerie flapping sound]

14:49.156 --> 14:51.324
A window!

15:06.306 --> 15:09.342
- Think it would
get cooler at night.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.455
- Do you feel safe?

15:25.058 --> 15:27.094
- Yeah, why?

15:40.107 --> 15:42.109
- A window.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.981
A window!

15:49.249 --> 15:52.219
[eerie music]

15:52.252 --> 15:59.292
*

16:01.261 --> 16:04.164
- Um--

16:04.197 --> 16:07.067
I'm just--I'm actually
trying to get to the house

16:07.100 --> 16:09.202
and I keep on walking,
but I don't seem

16:09.236 --> 16:10.203
to get any closer.

16:10.237 --> 16:13.406
Could you help me?

16:13.440 --> 16:16.176
- I am framed
but not guilty.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.611
I have locks but no hair.

16:18.645 --> 16:21.348
I only close when I'm open

16:21.381 --> 16:27.120
and my jam will not
spread on any toast.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.355
What am I?

16:28.388 --> 16:30.423
- A waste of time.

16:35.462 --> 16:36.596
- Anyway.

16:36.629 --> 16:39.599
[eerie music]

16:39.632 --> 16:47.040
*

16:57.684 --> 17:01.388
- This time,
let's make him stay dead.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.456
[sighs]

17:04.191 --> 17:06.259
- You ready?
- I got this.

17:06.293 --> 17:08.628
[motor starts]

17:11.598 --> 17:14.334
[machine roaring]
- [muffled yelling]

[eerie music]

17:32.219 --> 17:36.323

17:36.356 --> 17:39.226
- No! I know what you did.
I know.

17:39.259 --> 17:40.527
- Calm down.
- I know!

17:40.560 --> 17:42.595
No, he's watching us
while we're changing!

17:42.629 --> 17:44.231
He is watching us--

17:44.264 --> 17:45.665
You watch my sister?!

17:45.698 --> 17:47.667
And then the flowers
are towards the house.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.202
How do you explain that?
- I have no idea

17:49.236 --> 17:50.503
what she's talking about.
- What?

17:50.537 --> 17:52.239
I know what you did.
- No idea what

17:52.272 --> 17:53.240
she's talking about.
- He's been watching us

17:53.273 --> 17:54.274
while we are changing.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.542
- Look at this--it's family--

17:55.575 --> 17:56.609
- These are turned
towards the house!

it's our best option.

19:57.397 --> 19:58.698
- He's in their pocket.

19:58.731 --> 19:59.766
- He's my dad.

19:59.799 --> 20:02.635
- So you trust him?

20:07.574 --> 20:09.742
- You know, all my life,

20:09.776 --> 20:14.347

that I have a weak stomach,

enough times, you start--

20:23.356 --> 20:25.392
you start believing it.

20:26.826 --> 20:29.496
So maybe--

20:29.529 --> 20:32.665
maybe somewhere along the line
I stop trusting my gut.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.736
Maybe--shit--maybe--

20:36.769 --> 20:39.739

about my dad, they were there

all along.

I just didn't pay attention.

And now--

20:50.883 --> 20:54.354
now I'm listening to my gut.

20:54.387 --> 20:56.789
And it says that
they have something on him.

20:56.823 --> 20:59.792
They do. They have something on
him that forced his hand.

20:59.826 --> 21:02.662
But Louise, this--

21:02.695 --> 21:04.764
this'll force his hand
the other way.

21:06.433 --> 21:09.402
Because a fight has started.

21:09.436 --> 21:12.405
And he'll have to
make a choice.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.944

he's not a monster.

21:17.977 --> 21:21.848

is "Futurama," for God's sake.

- Why?

22:36.856 --> 22:38.858
- Because he's a dear.
- Robert can take care

of himself,
he's like Father.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.929
He's often away forever.

22:42.962 --> 22:44.531
Am I embarrassing you, Mother?

22:44.564 --> 22:46.866
- Yes, why don't you
keep your voice down?

22:46.899 --> 22:51.571
- Keep my voice down?
- Yes.

22:51.804 --> 22:54.407

his messes for years.

Even when we lived down there.

Why should I care about him?
Do you--

22:57.577 --> 22:58.778
do you think
he cares about me?

22:58.811 --> 23:00.980
- He's your--he's your brother.

23:01.013 --> 23:03.816
Of course he cares.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.620
- Robert's a pirate.

23:07.654 --> 23:09.789
He's off on another one
of his adventures.

23:09.822 --> 23:11.658

your heart'll just
up and eat itself.

And then it moves on
to your brain.

And then it goes down
to your spine

in the Deputy Chief's ear.

37:15.801 --> 37:18.604
Son, I'll take it from here.

37:20.806 --> 37:23.875
[blade slices]

37:23.909 --> 37:26.878

37:36.855 --> 37:40.526

- [screams]

37:42.961 --> 37:45.697
- * Break it

37:45.731 --> 37:49.801
* Break it to me gently

37:49.835 --> 37:52.471
- It's both. It's both.

37:52.504 --> 37:56.842
- * Give me a little time
to ease the pain *

37:59.911 --> 38:05.684
* Love me just
a little longer *

38:05.717 --> 38:09.688
* 'Cause I'll never, never

38:09.721 --> 38:12.691
* Love again

- [gasps]

38:26.972 --> 38:29.608
- Alice.

38:29.641 --> 38:32.911
- What was that?

38:32.944 --> 38:35.481
- It's your disease.

38:36.648 --> 38:40.586
The evolution of your madness.

38:40.619 --> 38:43.755
It's not good enough
to put a knife in it.

38:43.789 --> 38:46.658
It'll heal itself
and grow back.

38:46.692 --> 38:49.595
It needs to be extracted.

38:52.498 --> 38:54.666
I can do it for you.

38:57.002 --> 39:00.906
Just say...

39:00.939 --> 39:03.775
Joey, cut off his head.

Oh, oh.

[eerie music playing]

39:59.498 --> 40:01.467
- Does it help?

40:01.500 --> 40:06.872
*

40:06.905 --> 40:09.508
Eatin' your own flesh
as sacrament's kind of

40:09.541 --> 40:12.711
a Biblical misreading there,
I think. [laughs]

40:15.781 --> 40:18.784
Oh, I'm starting
to really like you.

40:35.867 --> 40:38.604

40:52.818 --> 40:54.553
- To the family.

40:54.586 --> 40:57.489
- No. Don't do it.

40:57.523 --> 41:00.592
Alice--Alice, don't.

41:00.626 --> 41:03.862
Alice. Alice.

41:05.897 --> 41:07.733
- To family.
