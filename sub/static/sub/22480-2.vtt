00:00.001 --> 00:01.507
There he is. Omar Idrisi.

00:01.547 --> 00:03.863
Incoming!

00:03.903 --> 00:07.926
Have you heard of the Section Initiative,
dangerous soldiers for dangerous missions?

00:07.966 --> 00:11.559
This is the target... Omair
Idrisi and his wife Jane Lowry.

00:11.599 --> 00:14.778
Prince Khalid, we suspect
he is funding the terrorists.

00:14.818 --> 00:16.589
- Mr Ives.
- You have the money?

00:16.629 --> 00:19.647
I really do love money.

01:16.635 --> 01:19.795
I guess you'll wanna check the merchandise.

01:21.278 --> 01:24.598
Portable air defence
system, infrared homing.

01:24.686 --> 01:27.726
Annular blast fragmentation...

01:28.267 --> 01:30.076
warheads.

01:32.359 --> 01:34.220
Time to settle up.

01:39.153 --> 01:41.231
Yeah, we've been, um...

01:42.424 --> 01:44.857
reconsidering the price.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.093
You see these men?

01:51.916 --> 01:57.859
If I told you how much they
get paid, you'd probably cry.

01:57.953 --> 02:00.424
And believe me, they're
worth every goddamn cent,

02:00.464 --> 02:02.988
so you pay me what we
agreed or they'll reduce

02:03.082 --> 02:06.288
your little Jihad here
to a stain in the sand.

02:08.955 --> 02:10.612
You smell...

02:11.927 --> 02:14.769
...lovely, by the way.

02:16.237 --> 02:21.237
A man should be rewarded
for his labours, Mr Ives.

02:40.268 --> 02:41.647
Take care now.

02:41.687 --> 02:43.647
Keep the truck.

02:44.057 --> 02:45.217
OK!

02:47.815 --> 02:50.323
Let's get the hell out of this sand pit.

03:03.872 --> 03:07.129
Surface-to-air,
infrared homing.

03:09.094 --> 03:11.094
What are you thinking?

03:11.166 --> 03:13.678
Ever since the Prince was taken...

03:14.909 --> 03:17.054
...loose ends concern me.

03:23.814 --> 03:26.084
You motherfuckin'...

04:05.608 --> 04:08.529

04:15.340 --> 04:17.968
'We will wipe the sickness out.'

04:18.055 --> 04:20.970
Sorry, ma'am. We've got a fix
on the target. It's urgent.

04:23.338 --> 04:26.937
Morgan Ives, arms dealer.
According to Prince Khalid,

04:27.015 --> 04:29.210
he's the one selling the arms to Idrisi.

04:29.265 --> 04:32.567
Five minutes ago, we
intercepted a distress signal.

04:32.653 --> 04:35.259
Ives' helicopter has been
downed just outside Ajir.

04:35.321 --> 04:36.858
The signal suggests there are survivors,

04:36.918 --> 04:39.100
although we don't know who or how many.

04:39.183 --> 04:43.106
- OK, that's that.
- If we chopper in, how close can we get?

04:43.169 --> 04:46.058
This is Ajir, as in "total
war zone, insurgent stronghold,

04:46.121 --> 04:48.133
one of the most dangerous places on Earth".

04:48.195 --> 04:50.507
- Direct quote, New York Post.
- Times.

04:50.547 --> 04:51.217
What?

04:51.257 --> 04:54.175
- The Times, not The Post.
- The point is, someone said it.

04:54.238 --> 04:55.497
You sounded a bit scared.

04:55.563 --> 04:59.957
You don't get into a bathtub with a
400-pound gorilla and come out laughing.

05:00.006 --> 05:02.592
If we get Morgan Ives out alive, we
find out what he was selling Idrisi

05:02.646 --> 05:03.999
and a location.

05:04.039 --> 05:05.235
Good luck with that.

05:05.309 --> 05:09.618
If he's gone down in Ajir and somehow
even survived, he now has a life expectancy

05:09.668 --> 05:11.743
of not very fucking long!

05:11.824 --> 05:13.998
What you're saying is let's get a move on!

05:14.053 --> 05:17.163
I'd like to hear what Mr
Ives has to say for himself.

05:17.236 --> 05:21.387
A Coalition pilot will drop you nearby.
Go in, extract him and do it fast!

05:34.975 --> 05:36.537
Come on!

05:37.826 --> 05:39.493
Come on!

05:41.091 --> 05:41.735
Oh!

05:45.289 --> 05:46.289
David!

05:46.706 --> 05:49.392
I'm gonna need you to find a pay phone.

05:49.471 --> 05:51.258
- Find a what?
- Don't worry. I'm kidding.

05:51.324 --> 05:53.427
We're probably gonna die here.

05:54.448 --> 05:55.815
Ugh!

05:56.159 --> 05:58.503
I guess it's just you and me now, Mikey.

05:58.577 --> 05:59.264
What?

06:01.673 --> 06:02.681
Shit!

06:19.062 --> 06:22.391
Any of you speak English?

06:22.493 --> 06:26.266
I'm willing to pay five thousand dollars...

06:28.678 --> 06:31.064
...to anyone who escorts me out of here.

06:31.104 --> 06:34.465
That's cash. Five thousand!

06:37.505 --> 06:38.432
Ten!

06:56.932 --> 06:58.515
Fucking phone!

07:27.751 --> 07:28.610
Moving.

07:30.316 --> 07:31.980
Whoa, whoa! Easy, easy!

07:33.485 --> 07:35.889
- Morgan Ives?
- Who the hell are you?

07:36.007 --> 07:37.056
McAllister.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.279
Wyatt.

07:40.787 --> 07:43.002
Wyatt, relieve Mr Ives of his weapon.

07:43.042 --> 07:45.541
I'm a true believer in
the Second Amendment, son.

07:45.625 --> 07:47.774
Great. Let's have a beer some time. Weapon!

07:49.204 --> 07:52.742
Bravo One to Zero. We have
the package, moving to exfil.

07:53.605 --> 07:55.224
- Moving!
- Move!

07:56.025 --> 07:58.865
- Move, move!
- OK, I'm moving.

08:17.137 --> 08:19.021
I've got a squirter heading south!

08:52.742 --> 08:53.697
Idrisi!

09:09.178 --> 09:13.355
So you were just in the area

09:13.465 --> 09:15.978
and picked up on the distress signal?

09:16.717 --> 09:19.407
Oh, no. This was a special trip.

09:20.219 --> 09:22.351
We want to have a chat
with you about Omair Idrisi.

09:22.391 --> 09:24.532
No idea what you're talking about.

09:24.602 --> 09:26.710
You're trying to tell us you've
never heard of Omair Idrisi?

09:26.750 --> 09:31.178
Even my mother knows who he is.
I'm saying I don't do business

09:31.273 --> 09:32.990
with terrorists.

09:33.419 --> 09:36.310
Your intel was bad, boys. Suck it up.

09:36.568 --> 09:38.048
It happens.

09:38.981 --> 09:39.860
Psst!

09:41.099 --> 09:42.595
Signal fires.

09:43.858 --> 09:44.739
Yeah.

09:44.825 --> 09:46.905
Now everyone knows where we are.

09:47.132 --> 09:48.858
- Novin!
- Moving!

09:57.651 --> 09:58.651
Move!

10:05.765 --> 10:07.022
And it's confirmed?

10:08.272 --> 10:09.562
Roger that, sir. Out.

10:10.393 --> 10:11.908
Bad news, I'm afraid, ma'am.

10:15.613 --> 10:16.842
Stay close.

10:24.169 --> 10:27.263
- 'Zero for Brave One.'
- Brave One, go ahead.

10:27.303 --> 10:29.767
Sandstorm incoming. Helo's been grounded.

10:29.846 --> 10:31.471
You'll have to find a new exfil.

10:32.597 --> 10:36.825
Intel suggests insurgency is
thinnest on the east side of town.

10:37.942 --> 10:41.641
Listen up. Change of plan. Helo's grounded.

10:41.766 --> 10:45.364
We're going to proceed on foot
until we find a vehicle we can take.

10:45.459 --> 10:48.467
- Roger.
- You want us to walk out of here?

10:48.570 --> 10:49.952
We'll never make it.

10:49.992 --> 10:53.194
The local pastime is insurgency

10:53.250 --> 10:55.824
and guerrilla warfare.

10:57.196 --> 10:59.953
Keep sharp for a vehicle we can take.

11:01.505 --> 11:02.527
Moving!

11:02.600 --> 11:04.786
You should have left me
at the fucking crash site.

11:04.841 --> 11:07.036
At least my death would have been quick.

11:20.150 --> 11:22.031
Novin, we've got a vehicle here.

11:25.696 --> 11:26.767
Moving!

11:37.963 --> 11:41.321
Good job, soldier. Could
have been an insurgent cat.

11:41.361 --> 11:43.967
- You can never be too careful.
- Dick!

11:45.106 --> 11:47.058
Sorry, Captain. This hunk
of turd's going nowhere.

11:47.098 --> 11:47.942
Shit!

11:48.464 --> 11:49.487
Move out.

11:51.234 --> 11:52.196
Moving.

11:53.235 --> 11:58.178
- Let's go.
- What division are you guys with?

11:58.218 --> 12:00.561
The Royal Division of
Please Shut The Fuck Up!

12:00.639 --> 12:02.995
At least give me my sidearm back.

12:03.035 --> 12:05.247
- I'm naked here.
- You want your sidearm?

12:05.287 --> 12:06.570
- Yeah.
- How about you start talking about

12:06.610 --> 12:07.812
Omair Idrisi?

12:07.892 --> 12:11.415
Like what he was buying and
where his base of operations is.

12:11.455 --> 12:16.105
All wonderful questions,
but I've never met the man.

12:16.191 --> 12:19.347
You think this is a fishing
trip? We have Prince Khalid.

12:19.448 --> 12:20.865
We know about the money.

12:21.524 --> 12:24.675
Well, maybe you get me to safety first,

12:24.755 --> 12:26.715
then we'll see.

12:26.795 --> 12:30.302
- No, we'll see now.
- It's vital you're properly invested

12:30.342 --> 12:32.507
in my continued wellbeing.

12:33.881 --> 12:35.555
You really are a piece
of shit. You know that?

12:35.624 --> 12:39.025
You have to keep this piece of shit alive,

12:39.096 --> 12:41.271
so eyes on, soldier.

12:41.664 --> 12:43.507
Stay frosty.

12:58.050 --> 12:59.539
Hey, hey!

13:01.220 --> 13:03.854
Easy, easy, easy. You two come here.

13:04.888 --> 13:06.185
Hey, hey!

13:10.943 --> 13:13.277
- He's clean.
- Where you want to go?

13:13.334 --> 13:14.822
I get you there, no trouble.

13:15.591 --> 13:18.739
The mission priority is to get
Mr GQ here and his intel to safety

13:18.801 --> 13:20.828
and safety is still a
hell of a long walk away.

13:20.879 --> 13:23.351
Kid, listen to me. What's your name?

13:23.398 --> 13:24.382
Saddam.

13:24.422 --> 13:27.373
You have got to be fucking kidding me!

13:27.443 --> 13:30.675
- It's a common name.
- It's a big, red flag.

13:30.791 --> 13:33.862
Saddam, we need a car.

13:33.932 --> 13:37.645
Cars? Sure. I can take you to
cars. What kind do you want?

13:37.720 --> 13:40.318
- Anything that works.
- 20 dollars.

13:43.903 --> 13:45.839
Anyone got 20 dollars?

13:45.971 --> 13:46.654
You, asshole!

13:46.694 --> 13:48.178
- Fuck you!
- Hey!

13:50.798 --> 13:52.137
Business is good.

13:53.418 --> 13:55.546
I'm all for utilising local knowledge,

13:55.609 --> 13:57.555
but what's to say he's not
gonna lead us down sniper alley?

13:58.618 --> 14:00.033
Thank you.

14:00.104 --> 14:02.972
Listen to me. I'm not
just giving you money.

14:03.042 --> 14:04.887
I'm giving you my trust. Do you understand?

14:05.704 --> 14:09.859
- You understand?
- Of course. This way, Captain America.

14:09.945 --> 14:11.523
Let's go.

14:11.609 --> 14:13.558
- Come on.
- Good boy.

14:13.620 --> 14:16.835
You stupid, stupid, stupid...

14:16.915 --> 14:18.723
- Quick question.
- Shut it, Ives!

14:18.830 --> 14:22.100
If that kid's full of shit, is Captain
America gonna put a bullet in him?

14:24.026 --> 14:25.201
Kid, wait up!

14:54.736 --> 14:55.955
Stay behind me.

15:04.299 --> 15:06.417
Hey, mister! You want a girl?

15:06.487 --> 15:10.263
Yeah, sure. That's all I need
right now... some war zone pussy.

15:10.896 --> 15:13.928
50 dollars. Very sexy lady.

15:14.850 --> 15:17.955
Someone explain sarcasm
to little Hussein here.

15:34.609 --> 15:37.609
- What's the matter?
- I've got a bad feeling.

15:39.038 --> 15:40.563
Where do you think everybody went?

15:41.384 --> 15:43.304
I go check, make sure everything is OK.

15:43.344 --> 15:44.942
- You wait here.
- I go first, OK?

15:44.982 --> 15:47.782
Kid, I said fucking wait! Shit!

15:49.555 --> 15:50.887
Shit!

15:50.979 --> 15:51.687
You stay.

15:51.744 --> 15:54.010
- I can't.
- Fuck's sake!

16:03.423 --> 16:04.595
Contact!

16:18.324 --> 16:19.522
Kid, get down!

16:35.382 --> 16:37.260
- Changing!
- Hurry!

16:38.757 --> 16:39.656
Ugh!

16:39.696 --> 16:42.306
Shit! The kid's been hit!

16:44.600 --> 16:45.738
Moving!

16:50.586 --> 16:52.466
- Moving!
- Moving!

16:53.722 --> 16:54.798
On me!

16:56.500 --> 16:58.300
- Move!
- Move!

17:23.766 --> 17:25.038
Let's go, let's go!

17:28.839 --> 17:31.460
It's OK, I've got him. Med kit!

17:36.126 --> 17:37.787
You're gonna be OK.

17:37.997 --> 17:40.659
You're gonna be OK.
Just breathe slowly, OK?

17:44.980 --> 17:47.620
Breathe. Breathe slowly.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.660
You're gonna be OK.

17:53.845 --> 17:56.192
For the best, right?

17:56.262 --> 17:58.833
In four years' time, he'd
be strapping on a bomb vest

17:58.911 --> 18:01.490
and strolling into the Red Cross.

18:09.322 --> 18:11.100
Oh!

18:12.443 --> 18:14.938
If you wanna find out where Idrisi is...

18:16.180 --> 18:18.906
...you keep your fucking hands off me!

18:18.968 --> 18:22.013
A lot of energy keeping you alive.
Maybe we should take a short cut.

18:25.916 --> 18:28.699
Well, what do you know?
Something still works around here.

18:28.777 --> 18:31.017
You're not that kind of soldier.

18:31.088 --> 18:33.228
You don't know the first thing about me.

18:33.336 --> 18:35.314
You don't know what Idrisi did to my men.

18:39.087 --> 18:40.361
Captain!

18:40.455 --> 18:43.496
We came for the intel,
not the man. Go ahead.

18:46.462 --> 18:48.173
What the fuck are you doing?

18:51.259 --> 18:54.179
- Are you gonna talk?
- Aaaargh!

18:55.436 --> 18:57.020
We need to move now!

19:00.582 --> 19:03.095
- They're coming through!
- Wanna move?

19:04.290 --> 19:05.238
Shit!

19:05.709 --> 19:06.829
Move!

19:09.688 --> 19:10.602
Go!

19:16.391 --> 19:17.382
Vehicle!

19:20.659 --> 19:21.580
Clear!

19:21.808 --> 19:22.738
Moving!

19:32.678 --> 19:34.100
Right, let's go.

19:36.340 --> 19:38.300
- Aagh!
- Shit!

19:39.786 --> 19:42.300
- Oh, shit! Get up. On your feet!
- Get him up!

19:42.380 --> 19:44.929
He's been hit. Shit!

19:44.969 --> 19:46.140
Fuck!

19:46.220 --> 19:48.180
Get him up.

19:49.420 --> 19:51.340
Wyatt!

19:58.682 --> 20:00.585
Novin, get us the hell out of here!

20:01.757 --> 20:03.300
Hang on!

20:31.250 --> 20:33.845
Right, so let me get this straight.
The last time you were here,

20:33.931 --> 20:38.217
the General tortured you and
then you blew up half his base?

20:38.257 --> 20:40.070
Technically speaking, that was McAllister.

20:40.168 --> 20:42.223
- Saving you.
- Brilliant.

20:42.946 --> 20:45.370
But it's the only medical
facility for miles,

20:45.450 --> 20:48.408
although last time, the General
didn't believe I was military.

20:48.448 --> 20:51.849
This piss-tank won't last much
longer. We need to take the risk.

20:51.904 --> 20:54.002
And the General is Bedouin.

20:54.042 --> 20:57.544
Under their culture, any stranger
can rock up and ask for sanctuary

20:57.611 --> 21:01.141
and the tribe will help them out
for three days. No questions asked.

21:01.864 --> 21:04.103
That was the plan, right?

21:06.167 --> 21:07.525
Yeah, that was the plan.

21:31.389 --> 21:32.841
Keep the engine running.

21:35.555 --> 21:41.035
General Farid, we have an injured civilian
who needs urgent medical attention.

21:41.237 --> 21:44.995
You may be military, but you
stole from me. You attacked my men.

21:45.161 --> 21:45.772
To be fair,

21:45.824 --> 21:47.674
- your men attacked us first.
- You raised weapons against us.

21:47.729 --> 21:50.298
That makes you the enemy.

21:51.096 --> 21:55.776
OK, I understand that, but, General,
I also understand that you're Bedouin.

21:56.028 --> 21:58.903
That is a culture I have a
huge amount of respect for.

21:59.755 --> 22:01.965
So I'm not asking for
your help as a soldier.

22:08.755 --> 22:10.581
I'm asking you as a guest.

22:16.230 --> 22:17.933
You son of a bitch!

22:27.358 --> 22:28.115
Aaagh!

22:39.469 --> 22:40.869
Aaagh!

22:52.675 --> 22:56.106
Representatives from the different groups

22:56.192 --> 22:58.179
standing side by side.

22:58.250 --> 23:01.237
Not a single voice raised in anger.

23:01.346 --> 23:05.699
For far too long now we
have fought amongst ourselves

23:05.871 --> 23:08.554
while the real enemy is out there.

23:09.972 --> 23:11.492
Time to unite,

23:11.625 --> 23:14.694
to take the fight to their homeland.

23:15.786 --> 23:18.017
I give you these missiles.

23:18.139 --> 23:20.401
In seven days' time,

23:20.479 --> 23:22.328
we will strike as one.

23:23.761 --> 23:26.375
Down with their airlines!

23:26.581 --> 23:28.855
Down with their planes!

23:29.941 --> 23:33.181
And while they look up
to the sky in fear...

23:34.108 --> 23:36.055
...my people

23:36.416 --> 23:39.695
will unleash the real horror below.

23:46.819 --> 23:48.696
Boys...

23:48.774 --> 23:50.346
Where the hell are we?

23:50.455 --> 23:52.215
Libyan National Army base.

23:52.739 --> 23:57.175
I'm gonna assume that's the famous
British sense of humour at work.

23:57.910 --> 24:00.007
You know what those people would do to me?

24:00.062 --> 24:02.615
So far, they've patched
you up and saved your life.

24:02.677 --> 24:06.599
We kept our side of the bargain and we
got you out. What did you sell Idrisi?

24:07.783 --> 24:11.208
Stinger missiles, 50 of 'em.

24:11.310 --> 24:18.048
Don't look at me like that. It's business.
Shit like this keeps the world going round.

24:18.150 --> 24:21.052
One Stinger missile alone could
take down a commercial airliner.

24:21.115 --> 24:22.446
You sold 'em 50.

24:22.532 --> 24:24.760
Where do we find Idrisi?

24:24.866 --> 24:26.986
I want immunity.

24:28.964 --> 24:30.678
OK, we can make it happen.

24:34.554 --> 24:37.552
I install trackers on the merchandise

24:37.646 --> 24:41.653
in case the clients try to rip me off.

24:41.747 --> 24:45.092
They sweep it for bugs and shit,

24:45.178 --> 24:48.590
but they don't have my tech.

24:51.602 --> 24:54.935
Get my cell phone and I'll show you.

25:07.973 --> 25:09.055
Well?

25:09.693 --> 25:11.175
Here it is.

25:11.541 --> 25:14.313
Yefren, up in the Nafusa Mountains.

25:14.391 --> 25:19.041
That's where the missiles are and
where you'll find Omair Idrisi.

25:19.088 --> 25:22.670
Now, if you don't mind, I'd
rather not spend another minute

25:22.757 --> 25:24.837
tied to this fucking bed.

25:24.907 --> 25:26.455
You're not going anywhere.

25:27.175 --> 25:29.375
You said I had immunity.

25:30.682 --> 25:33.228
Well, from us, absolutely.

25:34.335 --> 25:37.940
I've sold weapons that...

25:38.026 --> 25:42.932
that probably killed their
soldiers, their families.

25:43.026 --> 25:46.335
Don't worry. Bedouin. For
three days, you're their guest.

25:46.495 --> 25:49.658
- They won't hurt you.
- It's day four you've got to worry about.

25:49.698 --> 25:51.658
Please don't leave me here.

25:52.118 --> 25:54.524
I have money. I...

25:54.586 --> 25:56.868
I have money!

25:57.199 --> 25:59.655
Yefren, Nafusa Mountain Range.

25:59.914 --> 26:02.834
Yes, sir. Yeah, copy that, sir.

26:05.414 --> 26:07.211
Just checking in with my CO.

26:07.281 --> 26:11.458
- Right now, your CO's Donovan.
- This was my op. I didn't sign up to 20.

26:11.529 --> 26:14.890
Hey! You think I planned to end up here?

26:14.952 --> 26:17.781
Mac, revenge is like a storm. It's
easy to lose your way and end up

26:17.821 --> 26:18.953
far from where you wanted to go.

26:18.993 --> 26:21.827
Can you just stop with this
fortune cookie bullshit?

26:21.901 --> 26:25.184
You think putting a bullet in
Idrisi's chest will change things?

26:25.279 --> 26:27.068
Trust me, it won't.

26:27.147 --> 26:29.081
You suck at motivational speeches.

26:29.176 --> 26:32.901
You won't get to enjoy them any
longer. You get this done, I'm out.

26:34.522 --> 26:36.111
Let's get this done then.

26:49.562 --> 26:51.927
General, we don't need an escort.

26:53.699 --> 26:55.283
Escorts?

26:55.369 --> 26:57.533
We are a strike team.

26:57.635 --> 26:59.531
Idrisi is a son of Libya,

26:59.609 --> 27:03.099
but he has taken our words
and beliefs and poisoned them.

27:03.185 --> 27:06.909
If a man sees a snake cross
his yard, he removes its head.

27:08.913 --> 27:10.768
We ride with you.

27:14.760 --> 27:15.950
Works for me.

27:19.119 --> 27:20.696
Zero, heading out.

27:20.767 --> 27:23.656
Copy that. Be careful.

27:23.766 --> 27:25.200
You don't know what's lying ahead.

27:26.484 --> 27:29.240
'Some of you may know the
history of the Section.'

27:29.320 --> 27:32.878
Rumours of operatives going
rogue, the Whitehall assassination.

27:32.941 --> 27:34.790
None of that matters now.

27:34.868 --> 27:38.604
What matters is that
20 stood for something.

27:38.706 --> 27:40.899
They were the soldiers who
kept going when others fell,

27:40.939 --> 27:43.260
who saw the odds and didn't blink,

27:43.338 --> 27:47.059
who got the job done even when it
meant paying the ultimate price.

27:48.029 --> 27:52.477
'If we don't stop Idrisi,
the world will regret it.

27:52.547 --> 27:54.000
'So it's down to you now.

27:54.844 --> 27:56.269
'You are the Section.

27:57.447 --> 27:58.832
'You are 20.'

28:27.615 --> 28:29.615
OK, satellite's up.

28:34.026 --> 28:38.036
Bravo Team, we have multiple vehicles
leaving a compound heading due south.

28:38.076 --> 28:40.381
- Do you want us to intercept?
- 'Negative.'

28:40.451 --> 28:43.609
Farid's men can stop them.
Idrisi remains our target.

28:46.495 --> 28:49.004
'And if you find Jane Lowry,
bring her in yourself.'

28:49.113 --> 28:52.260
She's a British citizen. She can pay
for her crimes in a British court.

28:52.300 --> 28:53.456
Copy that.

29:10.005 --> 29:11.005
Ugh!

29:31.641 --> 29:34.021
The missiles are moving out.

29:34.210 --> 29:36.869
But more importantly...

29:36.998 --> 29:38.907
the forger has been found.

29:39.008 --> 29:41.306
We will have the Chechen
by the end of the week.

29:41.384 --> 29:44.389
- And is he in Europe?
- Yes.

29:44.452 --> 29:46.685
Then I must get to him.

29:46.802 --> 29:48.055
I'm not so sure.

29:50.194 --> 29:52.949
We've already discussed this.
I can move through Europe

29:53.017 --> 29:54.736
much more easily than you.

29:57.937 --> 30:00.015
Then I will see you in two days.

30:00.095 --> 30:02.415
Two days, that's all.

30:49.120 --> 30:51.120
Yalla.

30:51.715 --> 30:53.436
- No, wait.
- No, go.

30:55.425 --> 30:57.683
We need the Chechen, whatever happens.

30:57.762 --> 31:01.406
- I need to tell you something now.
- It must wait.

31:02.651 --> 31:03.630
Sorry.

31:05.835 --> 31:07.075
Yalla!

31:19.731 --> 31:23.120
Zero, Bravo One. We're gonna
lose comms. We're going deep.

31:27.353 --> 31:28.553
Shit!

31:30.244 --> 31:31.514
Comms are out, ma'am.

31:34.577 --> 31:35.609
Jensen?

31:44.027 --> 31:46.715
16-year-old
single malt, ma'am.

31:55.736 --> 31:56.904
I've got a tango!

31:56.944 --> 31:59.566
Hands in the air. Turn around, turn around!

31:59.606 --> 32:00.479
Help me!

32:00.520 --> 32:03.736
Turn around! Turn your face around!

32:03.776 --> 32:06.720
- Help me!
- Shit, it's Lowry. We've got Jane Lowry!

32:06.800 --> 32:08.880
Get up!

32:10.837 --> 32:12.892
Please get me out of here!

32:12.932 --> 32:15.376
Please! You don't know what they've done!

32:17.800 --> 32:19.279
Shut up! Hands!

32:21.636 --> 32:23.653
Boss wants her extracted.

32:23.755 --> 32:27.110
- You go. We'll stay on Idrisi.
- Mac, take him alive.

32:27.150 --> 32:28.745
- Copy that.
- Novin, on point!

32:28.831 --> 32:29.862
Moving!

32:30.018 --> 32:31.807
- Watch your arse!
- Always, baby.

32:31.893 --> 32:32.976
Move!

32:36.150 --> 32:39.150
'Understood. We have a
task force in Compound 34.'

32:41.498 --> 32:44.498
Ma'am, Colonel Parker from JSOC.

32:47.019 --> 32:49.380
Colonel Parker, we'll
need to make this quick.

32:49.443 --> 32:54.726
We will because there's no way in hell
the US military is gonna let Omair Idrisi

32:54.804 --> 32:57.561
and 50 Stinger missiles out into the world.

32:57.601 --> 33:00.812
General Farid has secured two
vehicles carrying missiles.

33:00.898 --> 33:03.384
My team will take care
of the rest and Idrisi.

33:03.463 --> 33:08.130
'An MOP missile strike would turn that
compound to dust, put an end to this.'

33:08.196 --> 33:10.796
I have people in there. I won't allow that.

33:11.632 --> 33:15.545
Adeena, I'm not asking your
permission. This is a courtesy call.

33:15.623 --> 33:18.123
Your Foreign Secretary
has given me the go-ahead.

33:18.229 --> 33:20.544
'Planes are scrambling,
missiles will be inbound,

33:20.584 --> 33:23.932
so get your team out of
there. We'll clean up.'

33:29.822 --> 33:31.913
Bravo to Zero, back on comms.

33:32.003 --> 33:34.130
- Novin, secure vehicle.
- Copy that.

33:37.484 --> 33:39.773
'Zero to Bravo One, send sit-rep.'

33:39.859 --> 33:41.968
Bravo One, we have Jane Lowry.

33:43.234 --> 33:47.546
Bring her in and get the team out. US
military are launching an air strike.

33:47.632 --> 33:51.383
30,000-pound bunker-buster.
It'll wipe the compound out.

33:51.453 --> 33:53.530
You know there's an ongoing op?

33:53.632 --> 33:56.028
Payload's due in ten. Tell
the team and Farid's men.

33:56.129 --> 33:57.684
The place is going up.

33:59.002 --> 34:01.322
Copy that. Come here.

34:04.188 --> 34:05.109
Move!

34:06.334 --> 34:07.438
Watch her!

34:16.161 --> 34:18.431
- Do you speak English?
- Yes.

34:18.510 --> 34:20.792
Ma'am, B-2 is nine minutes out.

34:22.467 --> 34:23.708
Aaagh!

34:29.560 --> 34:30.752
Changing!

34:53.647 --> 34:55.737
Cover him! Hurry up!

34:57.128 --> 34:58.206
Hey!

34:58.863 --> 35:01.640
- There is a missile.
- Yeah, there's 50 of 'em.

35:01.680 --> 35:03.027
No, coming this way.

35:03.105 --> 35:05.680
The Americans. Bunker-buster.

35:05.965 --> 35:07.688
You have to get out now!

35:09.772 --> 35:12.976
Get your men out of
here now! This is on you.

35:13.047 --> 35:16.117
Hey, I didn't know my CO would
call a fucking MOP strike!

35:18.626 --> 35:19.964
Go! Move it!

35:21.977 --> 35:23.803
Still nothing from Mac and Wyatt, ma'am.

35:26.225 --> 35:28.921
It's five minutes out, ma'am. Five minutes.

35:43.471 --> 35:44.387
Omair!

36:21.501 --> 36:23.661
Aagh! Aagh!

36:31.478 --> 36:32.417
Idrisi!

36:32.482 --> 36:33.308
Don't move!

36:36.539 --> 36:37.809
I'm going after him.

36:41.301 --> 36:42.381
Shit!

36:43.327 --> 36:46.473
Shit, fuck! Give me your hand.
Give me your hand. It's cool.

36:46.513 --> 36:47.921
Your people...

36:49.590 --> 36:51.750
...should not have come here.

36:54.326 --> 36:56.519
You should have left us alone.

36:58.273 --> 36:59.376
I know.

37:06.715 --> 37:08.160
Fuck it!

37:14.360 --> 37:15.889
Three minutes, ma'am.

37:23.390 --> 37:24.880
What the fuck's wrong with her?

37:26.832 --> 37:28.688
Shit! Shit!

37:28.776 --> 37:29.896
Shit!

37:30.222 --> 37:31.182
Agh!

37:41.035 --> 37:42.635
Fuck! Bitch!

37:56.035 --> 37:57.491
Two minutes out, ma'am.

38:35.783 --> 38:37.040
Novin!

38:37.167 --> 38:38.960
Novin, get up!

38:39.040 --> 38:41.000
Novin, Novin...

38:52.453 --> 38:53.504
Out!

38:56.016 --> 38:59.979
Ma'am, B-2 is 60 seconds from
target. Repeat, 60 seconds.

39:04.891 --> 39:07.556
Novin, get up or you're gonna burn alive!

39:08.600 --> 39:10.351
Mac, we've got to move.
The missile's coming.

39:10.391 --> 39:12.863
- I'm not leaving him.
- We don't have time.

39:16.920 --> 39:18.299
30 seconds out, ma'am.

39:18.354 --> 39:21.918
I'm bringing him in. He's gonna
pay for what he did. Get up!

39:25.226 --> 39:26.863
There, he's paid!

39:27.688 --> 39:30.118
25, 24...

39:30.361 --> 39:34.024
We can argue about this
later. Move! Come on!

39:35.160 --> 39:37.152
Payload is 20 seconds out, ma'am.

39:41.235 --> 39:42.206
Ten...

39:47.662 --> 39:48.892
Five,

39:48.970 --> 39:50.082
four,

39:50.183 --> 39:51.472
three,

39:51.551 --> 39:54.310
two, one...

39:54.382 --> 39:55.497
Payload away, ma'am.

40:30.970 --> 40:33.263
OK, go, go, go!

40:34.022 --> 40:36.013
Are you boys OK?

40:37.770 --> 40:41.649
Good job, boys. We'll move in
and confirm the target is dead.

40:42.244 --> 40:43.695
Oorah, gentlemen!

40:58.803 --> 41:00.730
You and your fucking
CO almost got us killed!

41:00.770 --> 41:01.857
Hey, hey!

41:01.897 --> 41:06.082
I just saved your life. If it wasn't
for me, you'd have still been in there

41:06.137 --> 41:07.877
when the fucking missiles hit!

41:08.857 --> 41:10.601
He was always gonna know, Mac.

41:10.656 --> 41:13.577
Donovan's people would've
had to tell US Central Command

41:13.650 --> 41:15.556
before we even fired a shot.

41:15.649 --> 41:17.120
I just wanted to get in there first.

41:17.200 --> 41:18.427
If the word you're looking for

41:18.474 --> 41:19.763
- is "sorry"...
- Hey!

41:21.004 --> 41:24.342
We got the son of a bitch. We got him!

41:25.714 --> 41:27.240
And tomorrow,

41:27.484 --> 41:29.420
I'll buy all the drinks, OK?

41:58.401 --> 42:01.715
- Revenge is a what?
- A storm, apparently.

42:02.708 --> 42:04.164
And then you get wet?

42:05.277 --> 42:07.384
Come on, it's a metaphor.

42:07.517 --> 42:09.006
It's a metaphor for...

42:09.846 --> 42:12.276
- For something.
- And then he's like,

42:12.316 --> 42:16.080
"A bullet won't change anything,
man." Then he shoots the bastard.

42:17.277 --> 42:20.927
Classic glory hunter move, eh? You
just wanted the credit, didn't you?

42:20.967 --> 42:24.320
Yeah, "the man who killed Omair Idrisi".

42:24.400 --> 42:26.903
No, I'm not saying I'm a
hero. I'm not saying that.

42:26.966 --> 42:28.579
- Good.
- Other people might say that.

42:28.619 --> 42:30.586
I can't stop 'em. That's all I'm saying.

42:31.558 --> 42:32.758
Ma'am?

42:33.448 --> 42:36.599
- Drink, Colonel?
- I prefer something from the top shelf.

42:36.731 --> 42:39.403
Wyatt, I've asked Parker
to extend your transfer.

42:43.929 --> 42:45.913
We took down Idrisi. The
mission's over, right?

42:45.953 --> 42:48.600
But the op is not. Jane
Lowry's still out there.

42:52.922 --> 42:56.640
But there are no split loyalties.
Either you're with 20 or you're not.

43:02.849 --> 43:04.897
Well, then, I guess I'm in.

43:04.983 --> 43:06.837
All the way down, right?

43:06.915 --> 43:08.400
All the way down.

43:09.542 --> 43:10.942
Good.

43:11.091 --> 43:14.401
Because we just got a hit on her. Move.

43:16.395 --> 43:19.715
Budapest. The woman
she's with is Rosa Varga.

43:19.778 --> 43:22.772
She runs a far-right
organisation, Magyar Ultra.

43:22.866 --> 43:25.139
What does a radical Jihadist
want with the far right?

43:25.287 --> 43:27.759
That's the question, Sergeant.

43:27.829 --> 43:31.240
Not 24 hours since her husband died
and already things are happening.

43:32.776 --> 43:36.446
'We need to find the answer
before it's too late.'

43:56.713 --> 44:00.322
Remember, Magyar Ultra need
to find Ilya Sarin for us.

44:03.006 --> 44:04.936
We cannot let Lowry have her man.

44:06.098 --> 44:09.641
Whoever he is, he's bad news.
