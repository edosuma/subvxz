WEBVTT

00:37.160 --> 00:38.640
Oh, man!

00:45.880 --> 00:47.720
I'm sorry, sir. Time's up.

00:47.760 --> 00:50.160
If she was your goat, she would have gone to you.

00:50.200 --> 00:51.480
This goat remains unclaimed.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.520
-Fidel. -Yes, sir.

00:56.560 --> 01:01.360
Goats aren't obedient. They don't come when called.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.200
You do know that, don't you?

01:35.240 --> 01:36.480
DWAYNE: Got him, Chief.

01:36.520 --> 01:38.760
Ah, Dwayne, well done.

01:41.840 --> 01:44.200
Oh, you can't put me in here.

01:44.240 --> 01:46.720
Why

01:49.400 --> 01:51.120
Maybe you should stop stealing yachts.

01:55.120 --> 01:57.040
Lily,

01:57.080 --> 01:59.560
I'm going to knock off early, if that's okay.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.880
Sure thing, sir, have a nice evening.

02:03.080 --> 02:04.520
Night, Chief.

02:31.120 --> 02:32.440
Hi.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.560
RADIO COMMENTATOR:<i> Well,</i> <i>I think the West Indies are</i>

03:08.560 --> 03:10.560
<i>being very clever...</i>

03:10.600 --> 03:12.120
FIDEL: Honore Police Station.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.200
Okay, and what time was this?

03:15.240 --> 03:17.720


03:17.760 --> 03:19.640
FIDEL: Okay, we'll send someone over

03:17.760 --> 03:19.640
right away.

03:19.680 --> 03:20.920
Hello?

03:21.600 --> 03:24.240
Um, Dwayne,

03:24.280 --> 03:25.680
you know Lord Salcombe's place?

03:25.720 --> 03:26.960
Mmm-hmm.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.680
Well, his panic room's gone into lockdown.

03:28.720 --> 03:32.280
Apparently, we've got the codes to open it in our safe.

03:32.320 --> 03:34.560
-Well, shall I go and... <i>-Oh, that's a very good shot.</i>

03:34.600 --> 03:36.480
<i>-A beautiful cover</i>

03:34.600 --> 03:36.480
<i>drive all the way...</i>

03:36.520 --> 03:39.480
-Dwayne! -Oh, for heaven's sake.

03:36.520 --> 03:39.480
I'll do it.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.520
Huh?

03:56.240 --> 03:57.760
We've got a problem.

04:01.440 --> 04:04.840
We were having a party and then from nowhere the alarm

04:01.440 --> 04:04.840
started blaring.

04:04.880 --> 04:07.360
Someone is locked inside the panic room.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.000
Where is Lord and Lady Salcombe?

04:09.040 --> 04:11.200
No one has seen them since the alarm went off.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.560
I think you should know,

04:14.600 --> 04:17.320
just before the alarm, there was a gunshot.

04:17.360 --> 04:19.080
Everybody heard it.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.920
So, everybody out, and don't touch anything.

04:27.920 --> 04:30.400
What's going on?

04:30.440 --> 04:33.560
LAWRENCE: There was a gunshot and the panic room has

04:30.440 --> 04:33.560
been locked down.

04:35.680 --> 04:36.760
Who's in there?

04:43.280 --> 04:45.040
What on earth would I be doing in there?

04:45.080 --> 04:47.360
Lawrence, call an ambulance.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.040
Now!

04:53.400 --> 04:55.120
It's Charlie Hulme.

05:34.960 --> 05:38.120
RICHARD: I've just been informed the airline have

05:34.960 --> 05:38.120
lost my luggage.

05:38.160 --> 05:40.200
LILY: Sorry to hear that, sir.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.320
RICHARD: If you could just point me in the direction of

05:40.240 --> 05:43.320
the lost luggage desk?

05:43.360 --> 05:44.960
Ah, thank you.

05:50.800 --> 05:53.440
We don't need outside help.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.880
Charlie Hulme was a British cop.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.840
They want a British cop to lead the case.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.320
RICHARD: What time do you open in the morning?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.440
WOMAN: 0600 hours, sir.

06:02.480 --> 06:07.480
RICHARD: Then I'll call you at 0601.

06:02.480 --> 06:07.480
Thank you very much, Daphne.

06:20.960 --> 06:21.960
Christ!

06:29.120 --> 06:31.640
Sainte-Marie was colonised by the French,

06:31.680 --> 06:33.480
who lost it to the British,

06:33.520 --> 06:35.600
who lost it to the Dutch.

06:35.640 --> 06:38.240
The Dutch lost it back to the French.

06:38.280 --> 06:43.120
The French then handed it back to the British

06:38.280 --> 06:43.120
in the mid-'70s.

06:43.160 --> 06:47.400
So about 30% of the population is still French.

06:47.960 --> 06:49.800
French, great. Just when I though it couldn't

06:49.840 --> 06:51.680
get any worse.

07:32.960 --> 07:34.920
Welcome to Honore Station.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.600
I got to go. The Commissioner is here.

07:36.640 --> 07:37.640
FIDEL: Ah.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.440
Sir.

07:41.480 --> 07:42.960
So, team,

07:43.000 --> 07:44.680
Dwayne, Fidel,

07:44.720 --> 07:47.520
this is Detective Inspector Richard Poole,

07:47.560 --> 07:49.800
from the Met in London.

07:49.840 --> 07:53.080
Thank you.

07:49.840 --> 07:53.080
I'll take over from here.

07:53.120 --> 07:56.640
Right, then. I want everything you've got on DI Hulme's death

07:56.680 --> 07:58.600
on my desk immediately.

07:58.640 --> 08:03.440
And if you can get onto IT to sort out

07:58.640 --> 08:03.440
the login details for my PC.

08:03.480 --> 08:05.640
It's imperative I get on the network ASAP.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.800
Pen-pusher.

08:08.840 --> 08:10.440
This is not going to go well.

08:11.920 --> 08:14.000
Sorry, my monitor won't turn on.

08:18.840 --> 08:20.800
Oh, this heat.

08:20.840 --> 08:22.960
Then take your jacket off.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.960
DI Hulme's been dead 48 hours.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.960
Is this all you've got?

08:27.000 --> 08:29.960
Where's the forensics report, ballistics, DNA?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.480
We'll have them soon.

08:31.520 --> 08:33.320
Who's this?

08:33.360 --> 08:36.120
Everybody in that photograph was on the guest

08:33.360 --> 08:36.120
list for the party,

08:36.160 --> 08:37.960
apart from that woman.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.160
And neither Lord or Lady Salcombe

08:38.000 --> 08:40.160
or any of the other guests

08:40.200 --> 08:42.160
know who she was or what she was doing there.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.920
-In the file.

08:44.720 --> 08:45.720
Is it always this hot?

08:46.160 --> 08:47.360
No.

08:47.400 --> 08:48.920
Sometimes it's a lot hotter.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.160
RICHARD: Look, I'll be honest with you.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.160
This whole Caribbean thing,

08:59.200 --> 09:02.160
I mean, I'm sure it's very nice but, um...

09:02.200 --> 09:05.080
Well, it's really not my idea of, uh...

09:05.120 --> 09:07.800
Yeah. So as soon as I've solved this case

09:07.840 --> 09:10.840
and I've got my luggage, I'm on the next plane home.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.680
I can't think why they sent me here.

09:13.480 --> 09:15.200
Sorry, where is here?

09:15.240 --> 09:16.880
I thought you might like to see

09:15.240 --> 09:16.880
where you're staying

09:16.920 --> 09:18.800
before we go up to the house.

09:18.840 --> 09:20.480
This is where we put the foreign officers.

09:20.880 --> 09:22.120
Like you

09:22.160 --> 09:24.080
and Charlie Hulme.

09:24.120 --> 09:26.520
This is Charlie's old house?

09:26.560 --> 09:29.480
You can freshen up and I'll pick

09:26.560 --> 09:29.480
you up in an hour.

10:35.520 --> 10:36.600
Christ.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.960
I think they're very pleased to have me here,

10:54.720 --> 10:57.960
if I'm honest.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.520
The welcome's been very, uh...

11:00.560 --> 11:02.120
Yeah, you know, and

11:00.560 --> 11:02.120
the accommodation's very...

11:03.920 --> 11:06.240
Oh, bloody splinter!

11:06.280 --> 11:07.840
Oh, God.

11:07.880 --> 11:10.280
Yeah, no, no, it's fine. It's fine, no.

11:10.320 --> 11:13.440
It does a little bit, yeah, yeah, mmm...

11:13.480 --> 11:15.840
Thank you for sending me, sir. Yep, okay.

11:15.880 --> 11:17.120
-Yeah, uh, sorry.

11:17.160 --> 11:19.120
Got to go, yeah, bye.

11:49.640 --> 11:53.120
So, how did a British policeman get mixed up

11:49.640 --> 11:53.120
with an aristocrat?

11:55.920 --> 11:57.560
Who, Charlie?

11:57.600 --> 12:00.400
Fun. Not your typical Englishman.

12:00.440 --> 12:02.160
Charismatic, you know?

12:02.200 --> 12:03.760
What do you mean by a typical Englishman?

12:05.160 --> 12:08.280
Detective Inspector Richard Poole,

12:05.160 --> 12:08.280
Metropolitan Police.

12:08.320 --> 12:10.040
LAWRENCE: Ah, yes. Come in.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.440
Thank you.

12:12.480 --> 12:15.160
Well, I was out here serving drinks

12:12.480 --> 12:15.160
to the guests.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.760
It had just gone 8:00.

12:18.600 --> 12:21.640
<i>Then there was</i> <i>a gunshot from the study</i>

12:23.600 --> 12:25.720
<i>and the alarms went off.</i>

12:25.760 --> 12:27.640
-Well,

12:27.680 --> 12:29.480
I waited for the police to arrive.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.040
Did you see this woman that night?

12:37.600 --> 12:38.760
No.

12:47.520 --> 12:49.280
What's that?

12:49.320 --> 12:51.120
It's a laser tape measure.

12:51.160 --> 12:54.280
Accurate to a millimetre over 150 meters.

12:54.320 --> 12:56.880
We do have tape measures on Sainte-Marie, you know.

12:56.920 --> 12:59.360
Not like this, you don't, Sergeant Thomson.

12:59.400 --> 13:03.880
Now, when DI Hulme's body was found,

12:59.400 --> 13:03.880
he was holding a book.

13:03.920 --> 13:06.840
A travel guide to Europe. Why?

13:06.880 --> 13:08.880
This is the vase, then, that was found

13:06.880 --> 13:08.880
smashed on the night?

13:08.920 --> 13:09.920
Mmm-hmm.

13:12.280 --> 13:14.600
When the room was locked down, could anyone else have got in?

13:14.640 --> 13:17.960
No. Not until I entered the code.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.400
And it can only be opened from the outside.

13:22.240 --> 13:23.760
Death was instantaneous?

13:23.800 --> 13:25.840
He was killed by a .22 bullet,

13:25.880 --> 13:29.320
shot up through the throat and straight into his skull.

13:29.360 --> 13:31.440
It could almost be suicide, couldn't it,

13:29.360 --> 13:31.440
but for two things.

13:31.480 --> 13:34.480
One, gunshot and then alarm.

13:34.520 --> 13:38.320
How could Charlie shoot himself, then manage to

13:34.520 --> 13:38.320
shut down a heavy steel door?

13:38.360 --> 13:41.640
And secondly, if it was suicide,

13:38.360 --> 13:41.640
why didn't we find a pistol?

13:41.680 --> 13:43.600
Then if it was murder...

13:43.640 --> 13:46.880
How did the murderer kill DI Hulme and then escape from

13:43.640 --> 13:46.880
a locked steel room?

13:46.920 --> 13:49.000
James Lavender, how do you do?

13:49.040 --> 13:52.240
Can you tell me exactly where you were standing when

13:49.040 --> 13:52.240
the gun went off?

13:52.280 --> 13:56.240
Fortunately for me, when the gun went off,

13:52.280 --> 13:56.240
I was down here on my beach.

13:56.280 --> 13:57.960
Oh, I see. Your beach.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.760
A little proprietorial, aren't we?

13:59.800 --> 14:01.840
Well, I do own it.

14:01.880 --> 14:04.920
Right. And what were you doing down here?

14:04.960 --> 14:10.960
<i>I was down here for</i> <i>a touch of privacy</i>

14:04.960 --> 14:10.960
<i>with a special friend.</i>

14:11.000 --> 14:14.360
A special friend who wasn't necessarily your wife?

14:14.400 --> 14:15.840
Which is rather the problem.

14:15.880 --> 14:18.440
James?

14:18.480 --> 14:20.080
JAMES: <i>My wife, Sarah, spotted us.</i>

14:21.280 --> 14:24.280
<i>The argument was quick,</i> <i>wordless.</i>

14:24.320 --> 14:26.880
<i>Ended with</i> <i>a large glass of wine</i>

14:24.320 --> 14:26.880
<i>all over her dress.</i> RICHARD:<i> Well, that means you</i>

14:26.920 --> 14:29.480
<i>were back at the party when</i> <i>the gun went off.</i>

14:29.520 --> 14:31.480
JAMES: <i>No, I came back down here.</i>

14:31.520 --> 14:33.600
But my friend had gone.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.120
And how well do you know the deceased?

14:36.160 --> 14:37.680
Not at all.

14:37.720 --> 14:38.720
Maybe Sarah invited him.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.960
Sorry, do we have to, um...

14:42.000 --> 14:44.320
LILY: Do you own a .22 pistol?

14:44.360 --> 14:46.000
JAMES: No, I don't know the first thing about guns.

14:46.040 --> 14:48.760
Wouldn't know one end from another.

14:46.040 --> 14:48.760
But you've really dressed for

14:48.800 --> 14:51.520
the Caribbean, haven't you?

14:51.560 --> 14:53.000
Yeah.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.080
Having heard the gunshot, what did you do next?

14:55.120 --> 14:57.640
Well, then the alarms went off. I didn't know

14:55.120 --> 14:57.640
what was going on so I hid.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.000
<i>Until I saw the police arrive.</i>

15:06.920 --> 15:09.080
I see the safe was open.

15:09.120 --> 15:11.400
How many people know the combination to open it?

15:11.440 --> 15:13.920
Well, I do, of course, and my wife.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.280
That's it

15:15.320 --> 15:17.760
-Yeah. -Well,

15:15.320 --> 15:17.760
did you open it that night?

15:17.800 --> 15:18.960
No.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.680
Or give DI Hulme the combination?

15:20.720 --> 15:23.760
-No! -Then your wife

15:20.720 --> 15:23.760
must have opened it.

15:23.800 --> 15:27.000
You're going to have to ask her

15:23.800 --> 15:27.000
yourself, aren't you?

15:27.040 --> 15:31.360
SARAH:<i> My dress was ruined.</i> <i>I was humiliated.</i>

15:27.040 --> 15:31.360
<i>I came back to the house.</i>

15:33.000 --> 15:35.640
So, this is where I was when the alarm went off.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.240
And what did you do next?

15:37.280 --> 15:40.320
I came in here to get dressed.

15:40.360 --> 15:42.800
Did you invite DI Hulme to the party?

15:42.840 --> 15:44.440
No. Didn't my husband?

15:44.480 --> 15:45.840
LILY: He says he didn't.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.520
On the day of the party, did you open the safe?

15:49.560 --> 15:51.120
No.

15:51.160 --> 15:53.640
Or give DI Hulme the combination

15:51.160 --> 15:53.640
so he could open it?

15:53.680 --> 15:54.680
No.

15:58.800 --> 16:01.000
She's lying, isn't she?

16:01.040 --> 16:03.680
One of them must have opened the safe, but why?

16:03.720 --> 16:07.560
We got a British policeman murdered

16:03.720 --> 16:07.560
in a rich man's panic room,

16:07.600 --> 16:10.080
an old book clutched in his hands,

16:10.120 --> 16:13.200
a safe that's open and a vase that's smashed.

16:13.240 --> 16:17.400
As for suspects, only two people

16:13.240 --> 16:17.400
without an alibi.

16:17.440 --> 16:20.080
James, because he was down on his beach alone

16:20.120 --> 16:22.680
and Sarah because she was taking a shower.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.840
Not that any of this matters.

16:24.880 --> 16:27.680
Doesn't get us any closer to understanding the how.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.280
How did the murderer kill Charlie Hulme

16:29.320 --> 16:32.120
and escape from a locked steel room?

16:29.320 --> 16:32.120
It's impossible.

16:32.160 --> 16:35.240
I need to see the pieces from the vase and the book

16:32.160 --> 16:35.240
Charlie was holding.

16:35.280 --> 16:38.480
-But first I need to see the body.

16:35.280 --> 16:38.480
-That won't be possible.

16:38.520 --> 16:39.680
What won't?

16:39.720 --> 16:41.840
-No, none of it.

16:41.880 --> 16:44.760
The book, the body, the vase. None of it is here.

16:44.800 --> 16:47.320
-It's in Basse-Terre.

16:47.360 --> 16:48.880
Fine, we'll get some sandwiches

16:47.360 --> 16:48.880
on the way.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.480
Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe.

16:50.520 --> 16:51.920
Fine.

16:51.960 --> 16:53.720
Which is a completely different island.

16:56.560 --> 16:58.360
What?

16:58.400 --> 17:01.680
We don't have forensic labs and DNA analysis

16:58.400 --> 17:01.680
and ballistics here.

17:01.720 --> 17:03.840
We are just a small island.

17:03.880 --> 17:06.720
So, I bag the evidence from the murder

17:06.760 --> 17:08.400
and it all gets flown to Guadeloupe.

17:08.440 --> 17:10.360
Then how are we supposed to solve this case?

17:13.960 --> 17:16.440
Arrange for the vase and the book to be

17:13.960 --> 17:16.440
sent here by tomorrow morning.

17:16.480 --> 17:18.680
-Of course, sir.

18:12.280 --> 18:13.280
Hello?

18:15.040 --> 18:16.880
Who are you?

18:16.920 --> 18:19.680
I'm Detective Inspector Richard Poole

18:16.920 --> 18:19.680
of the Metropolitan Police.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.720
-I, um...

18:23.480 --> 18:25.320
I am Mr Hulme's cleaner.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.160
You're his cleaner?

18:28.640 --> 18:30.000
Mmm.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.320
Well, I won't get in your way.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.240
You got your work cut out.

18:35.040 --> 18:36.120
Thank you, sir.

18:39.320 --> 18:41.120
So, um...

18:42.040 --> 18:43.640
Are you a friend of Charlie's?

18:43.680 --> 18:45.120
Something like that.

18:45.160 --> 18:46.400
You're from England, right?

18:47.680 --> 18:49.200
Ah, you can tell, can you?

18:50.360 --> 18:51.640
Yeah.

18:51.680 --> 18:54.280
Um, what are you doing here?

18:54.320 --> 18:55.480
Is it a holiday, sir?

18:57.640 --> 18:58.720
You haven't heard, have you?

18:59.920 --> 19:01.240
Heard what?

19:15.600 --> 19:18.240
And he was such a nice man.

19:18.280 --> 19:22.800
-So full of life. Not your typical...

19:18.280 --> 19:22.800
-Yes, I've heard. Yeah.

19:22.840 --> 19:24.480
But who would kill him?

19:24.520 --> 19:26.400
We're pursuing a number of lines

19:24.520 --> 19:26.400
of enquiry.

19:31.120 --> 19:33.680
Are you... Are you staying here, sir?

19:37.040 --> 19:39.160
I hope not.

19:39.200 --> 19:40.680
Well, do you need a cleaner?

19:42.360 --> 19:46.160
Or laundry? I could always send

19:42.360 --> 19:46.160
any of your suits.

19:46.200 --> 19:48.320
No, it's fine. Really. Don't worry.

19:48.360 --> 19:50.000
I'll just, um,

19:50.040 --> 19:52.400
borrow the odd item from Mr Hulme.

19:52.440 --> 19:55.000
-They are not all clean. -Oh, please.

20:05.520 --> 20:09.160
No. You lost my suitcase, so you can find my suitcase.

20:10.760 --> 20:12.560
What do you mean you've got no record of it?

20:12.600 --> 20:15.160
I filled in the form. I gave to it Daphne.

20:15.200 --> 20:18.680
Daphne. She was standing by the lost luggage counter

20:15.200 --> 20:18.680
when I lost my...

20:20.760 --> 20:22.000
I'll ring you back.

20:24.720 --> 20:25.720
Shoo!

21:04.000 --> 21:07.440
Where can I get a .22 calibre gun

21:04.000 --> 21:07.440
and some blank rounds?

21:10.280 --> 21:11.480
Best if I don't ask?

21:11.520 --> 21:13.680
It's always best if you don't ask.

21:15.240 --> 21:18.080
So, the book and the vase have arrived

21:15.240 --> 21:18.080
from Guadeloupe.

21:18.120 --> 21:19.800
Well done. Very good work.

21:21.440 --> 21:24.400
So this is it, the book Charlie

21:21.440 --> 21:24.400
was holding when he was shot?

21:24.440 --> 21:25.760
-Mmm-hmm. -Hmm.

21:25.800 --> 21:28.000
What's so special about it?

21:28.040 --> 21:29.200
Ah!

21:29.240 --> 21:32.240
And now the pieces from the smashed vase.

21:32.280 --> 21:34.600
Yeah, yeah, this is all good. I should be able...

21:34.640 --> 21:35.920
There's still two more bags, sir.

21:35.960 --> 21:39.080
Even so, a bit of glue, and...

21:39.120 --> 21:42.000
Okay. The gun is sorted.

21:42.040 --> 21:44.040
Well, when you get it,

21:44.080 --> 21:46.440
bring it straight to James Lavender's house.

21:46.480 --> 21:48.040
Lily and I are going there now.

21:48.080 --> 21:49.760
We are

21:49.800 --> 21:52.200
As it turns out, Lady Salcombe's

21:49.800 --> 21:52.200
been lying to us.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.600
Good morning, Lady Salcombe.

22:12.640 --> 22:14.320
Please, call me Sarah.

22:14.360 --> 22:16.960
Then tell me, Sarah, why did you lie to me?

22:17.000 --> 22:19.520
-You knew Charlie Hulme.

22:19.560 --> 22:23.160
-No, I didn't. -You've been to his house.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.040
I smelled the perfume on one of his towels,

22:25.080 --> 22:27.680
a perfume I'd only smelled once before,

22:25.080 --> 22:27.680
in your dressing room.

22:29.360 --> 22:31.120
No!

22:31.160 --> 22:33.160
-In the panic room that night. -I didn't.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.400
Then you calmly went for a shower, washing off any

22:33.200 --> 22:35.400
trace of evidence

22:35.440 --> 22:36.840
-in the process. -No, I didn't kill Charlie.

22:36.880 --> 22:38.280
But you did, Sarah, in cold blood.

22:38.320 --> 22:39.960
You put a gun to his throat and pulled the trigger.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.080
No. I didn't kill him. I loved him!

22:43.120 --> 22:46.520
I'd always worried that James would

22:43.120 --> 22:46.520
find out about Charlie and me.

22:47.680 --> 22:50.280
When I saw him shot dead, it's...

22:50.320 --> 22:51.520
You think James killed him?

22:53.480 --> 22:57.200
-Charlie was investigating my husband.

22:57.240 --> 22:59.200
He said he didn't dare tell me.

22:59.240 --> 23:00.440
My life would be in danger.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.880
It was you.

23:01.920 --> 23:03.680
You gave Charlie the combination

23:01.920 --> 23:03.680
to the safe, didn't you?

23:05.240 --> 23:08.640
Charlie said there was a book in the safe

23:08.680 --> 23:11.640
and that if he could just get a hold of it,

23:11.680 --> 23:13.240
he would be able to put my husband in prison.

23:13.280 --> 23:16.000
We've seen the book. It's just an old guidebook.

23:16.040 --> 23:17.800
What's so special about it?

23:17.840 --> 23:19.720
Apologies for interrupting. Your colleagues

23:17.840 --> 23:19.720
say they're ready.

23:21.440 --> 23:24.280
Dwayne, Dwayne, so...

23:24.320 --> 23:25.720
Who is your prime suspect?

23:26.320 --> 23:27.800
Sorry?

23:27.840 --> 23:31.120
Well, we're having a little sweepstakes, so, you know,

23:31.160 --> 23:33.280
a nod in the right direction?

23:33.320 --> 23:35.760
It's a bit of a bit of a mystery so far.

23:35.800 --> 23:39.680
We're thinking of fitting up one of the staff.

23:39.720 --> 23:43.480
Listen. When I'm dressed like this,

23:39.720 --> 23:43.480
don't mess with me, okay?

23:50.040 --> 23:52.280
LILY: Okay, Dwayne, Fidel, are you in position?

23:52.880 --> 23:53.880
Yup.

23:56.360 --> 23:57.880
You sure these are blanks?

23:57.920 --> 23:59.200
Yes.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.320
Did either of you hear that?

24:07.360 --> 24:08.480
You fired that gun yet?

24:11.000 --> 24:13.480
The Detective Inspector is going to fire again.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.200
-No, nothing.

24:23.560 --> 24:25.920
This is a .22 pistol.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.920
Same calibre as the gun that killed Charlie Hulme,

24:27.960 --> 24:31.120
so if Dwayne and Fidel can't hear

24:27.960 --> 24:31.120
me firing on a day like today,

24:31.160 --> 24:33.800
what did the guests hear on the night of the party?

24:33.840 --> 24:35.840
The gunshot that killed Charlie Hulme.

24:35.880 --> 24:39.520
No, any gunshot they heard must have come from

24:35.880 --> 24:39.520
a larger calibre gun.

24:40.200 --> 24:41.560
A louder gun.

24:41.600 --> 24:43.520
Ah, well, if it's a louder gun you're looking for...

24:43.560 --> 24:44.720
You said you didn't own a gun.

24:44.760 --> 24:47.400
No, I said I didn't own a .22 pistol.

24:47.440 --> 24:49.920
But if it's a large gun you're after...

24:47.440 --> 24:49.920
Darling?

24:49.960 --> 24:51.320
What large gun?

24:51.360 --> 24:52.600
It was my father's.

24:52.640 --> 24:54.480
His service revolver.

24:54.520 --> 24:55.800
It's been here for years.

25:06.640 --> 25:08.200
It's gone.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.920
There's a box of bullets but...

25:10.960 --> 25:12.840
but the gun's disappeared.

25:12.880 --> 25:15.800
.38 calibre Smith &amp; Wesson rounds. Yep.

25:16.400 --> 25:17.920
It's a loud gun.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.520
And now it's missing.

25:20.560 --> 25:23.240
-Me, of course. And...

25:24.680 --> 25:26.120
and James.

25:26.160 --> 25:29.120
-No.

25:29.160 --> 25:32.840
So, once again, it's either James or Sarah

25:32.880 --> 25:35.040
and I don't pick Sarah as a murderer.

25:35.080 --> 25:37.720
Are you saying women don't kill people?

25:37.760 --> 25:41.720
Sir, she doesn't have an alibi for the time of the murder,

25:37.760 --> 25:41.720
hmm?

25:41.760 --> 25:43.720
She was having an affair with the deceased,

25:43.760 --> 25:47.440
she owns a gun she didn't tell us about, which now has

25:43.760 --> 25:47.440
apparently gone missing.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.360
Oh, yes, and she turns up at the scene of the murder

25:49.400 --> 25:51.800
having showered and washed her hair?

25:51.840 --> 25:53.120
Well, that, at least, is understandable.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.440
What?

25:54.480 --> 25:56.400
The shower. This unremitting heat.

25:56.440 --> 25:58.000
I mean, how many showers do you have a day?

26:04.640 --> 26:07.640
What's in this book worth dying for?

26:10.240 --> 26:13.680
You know, if we could just prove the service revolver was

26:10.240 --> 26:13.680
fired that night...

26:17.760 --> 26:20.480
-Yeah.

26:20.520 --> 26:22.800
Well, it would mean that Charlie could have been

26:20.520 --> 26:22.800
killed before 8:00

26:22.840 --> 26:26.160
with a quiet .22 pistol and the service revolver was

26:22.840 --> 26:26.160
only fired at 8:00

26:26.200 --> 26:29.040
to establish an apparent time of death.

26:29.080 --> 26:31.000
You need a break.

26:38.920 --> 26:41.960
So, tell me, what's London like?

26:44.320 --> 26:47.440
Oh, uh, noisy, a mess.

26:47.480 --> 26:50.320
Like being in a bar fight, mostly, but...

26:50.360 --> 26:55.280
-Only place I'd live.

26:55.320 --> 27:00.000
What's a typical London experience, hmm? Something

26:55.320 --> 27:00.000
that fills you with joy?

27:02.440 --> 27:03.720
Tell me.

27:05.640 --> 27:06.880
Uh, so...

27:09.120 --> 27:13.120
Walking into my local, the White Hart.

27:09.120 --> 27:13.120
It's snowing,

27:13.160 --> 27:15.600
-bitterly cold outside, but there's a...

27:13.160 --> 27:15.600
-Right.

27:15.640 --> 27:20.760
...a fire roaring in the grate, the windows misty

27:15.640 --> 27:20.760
with condensation.

27:20.800 --> 27:25.720
And I've got a beer in my hand,

27:20.800 --> 27:25.720
sitting in the snug,

27:25.760 --> 27:29.520
in the chair that I sit in and that first sip...

27:29.560 --> 27:30.760
Alone?

27:33.600 --> 27:38.080
Yes, but that feeling, you know, of belonging,

27:33.600 --> 27:38.080
knowing who you are.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.520
Whatever this is, it's not that.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.400
Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow, shall I?

27:58.400 --> 28:00.760
Yes, yes, good idea. Yeah.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.640
-And, uh, thanks again. -Good night.

28:07.160 --> 28:08.760
Yeah. Good work.

28:10.200 --> 28:12.320
Uh, you've been fantastic.

29:50.560 --> 29:51.760
Oh, come on!

30:04.720 --> 30:06.040
Is the Inspector in yet?

30:06.080 --> 30:08.520
No. He found a key.

30:08.560 --> 30:10.720
Looks like it's for a safety deposit box.

30:10.760 --> 30:13.280
Him and Lily have gone to the bank to check it out.

30:15.200 --> 30:17.440
Just knock on the door when you want to be let out.

30:19.880 --> 30:23.000
So, Charlie's a policeman abroad. It's not

30:19.880 --> 30:23.000
necessarily suspicious

30:23.040 --> 30:26.280
that he would have a safety deposit box.

30:26.320 --> 30:28.040
On the other hand...

30:33.920 --> 30:37.760
Cash, forged passports... Human trafficking.

30:37.800 --> 30:40.920
It's got to be. Up through the Caribbean and

30:37.800 --> 30:40.920
into the States.

30:40.960 --> 30:45.880
It's a multi-million-dollar trade and it absolutely relies

30:40.960 --> 30:45.880
on corrupt officials.

30:45.920 --> 30:49.200
But how does all this tie in with James Lavender?

30:53.280 --> 30:55.760
Because that is James Lavender's boat.

30:57.880 --> 31:00.640
We found these in Charlie Hulme's

30:57.880 --> 31:00.640
safety deposit box.

31:00.680 --> 31:02.600
I want them logged and fingerprinted ASAP.

31:02.640 --> 31:04.600
Yes, sir. It's the airport. They found your luggage.

31:04.640 --> 31:06.080
Not now, Fidel. Dwayne.

31:06.120 --> 31:08.880
Lily's getting a warrant to search James'

31:06.120 --> 31:08.880
house and yacht.

31:08.920 --> 31:10.760
I need you to give me a lift to the harbour, if you would.

31:13.440 --> 31:16.680
You do have another car, don't you?

31:13.440 --> 31:16.680
It's not just...

31:18.760 --> 31:22.640
It's just the one car, isn't it? And what do you

31:18.760 --> 31:22.640
do in emergencies?

31:22.680 --> 31:24.560
I thought you'd never ask.

31:52.480 --> 31:55.920
-There she is over there. -Well, how are we

31:52.480 --> 31:55.920
going to get to it?

31:59.280 --> 32:02.240
No, no. We haven't got a search warrant.

32:12.600 --> 32:13.600
We have now.

32:22.040 --> 32:23.280
Locked.

32:34.680 --> 32:36.760
LILY: Hey! Look what I found!

32:48.040 --> 32:50.360
You all right there, sir?

32:50.400 --> 32:52.000
All right.

32:53.720 --> 32:55.960
-People smuggling. -Told you.

32:58.960 --> 33:00.960
-Hang on, you're Charlie's cleaner.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.440
-Charlie didn't have a cleaner.

33:04.120 --> 33:05.480
No! Dressed as a cleaner! Now what?

33:41.080 --> 33:42.280
There you are.

33:46.560 --> 33:50.960
Remind me to tell you the story of the tortoise and

33:46.560 --> 33:50.960
the hare sometime.

34:11.120 --> 34:13.040
What were you doing on James Lavender's boat?

34:15.200 --> 34:17.720
Okay. What's your relationship with James Lavender?

34:19.600 --> 34:22.840
And what were you doing in Charlie's house pretending

34:19.600 --> 34:22.840
to be a cleaner?

34:23.480 --> 34:24.880
Hang on.

34:30.760 --> 34:35.080
This is you here, isn't it? You were at

34:30.760 --> 34:35.080
the party that night.

34:39.120 --> 34:42.040
-No, of course not. -Then why are

34:39.120 --> 34:42.040
you talking to me?

34:44.520 --> 34:48.280
No, of course. I'll arrange for a duty solicitor to visit

34:44.520 --> 34:48.280
with you immediately.

34:53.720 --> 34:58.040
-Oh, no, it's just...

34:58.080 --> 35:02.000
It's a hundred degrees in here and you're standing

34:58.080 --> 35:02.000
there in a suit and tie

35:02.040 --> 35:05.240
-I'm a British policeman.

35:07.640 --> 35:09.320
And you're in there 'cause I found you on a boat

35:09.360 --> 35:11.720
that's been used for people-smuggling.

35:16.480 --> 35:19.240
Give me my phone call.

35:19.280 --> 35:21.360
Fidel, our friend wants her one phone call.

35:21.400 --> 35:23.680
-Yes, sir. -As for you and me, Lily,

35:23.720 --> 35:26.240
I think it's time to put the squeeze on James Lavender.

35:26.280 --> 35:27.320
Yes, sir.

35:31.520 --> 35:33.600
RICHARD: We're not leaving till we've got it all.

35:33.640 --> 35:37.040
How the people smuggling works, who that woman is that

35:33.640 --> 35:37.040
we've got in the cells,

35:37.080 --> 35:40.240
oh, and what Charlie was doing in the panic room

35:37.080 --> 35:40.240
when he was killed,

35:40.280 --> 35:43.080
why he was killed, why he was holding the book

35:43.120 --> 35:45.360
and how, finally,

35:46.400 --> 35:48.600
how Charlie was murdered.

35:52.600 --> 35:53.920
Oh, no.

36:01.240 --> 36:05.160
LILY: Dead. He must have shot himself.

36:05.200 --> 36:10.600
It's a .22 pistol, isn't it? Just like the one

36:05.200 --> 36:10.600
that killed Charlie.

36:10.640 --> 36:13.920
This isn't a suicide, sir. This is a confession.

36:13.960 --> 36:16.600
-James killed Charlie. -But someone

36:13.960 --> 36:16.600
warned him, didn't they?

36:19.400 --> 36:20.800
The one phone call.

36:22.880 --> 36:25.120
Okay, so who did you phone?

36:27.240 --> 36:29.200
You are in so much trouble.

36:37.840 --> 36:41.240
Sir, there's been a breakout. I'm ringing the Coast

36:37.840 --> 36:41.240
Guard and INTERPOL.

36:41.280 --> 36:44.240
We need to alert the airport. How did she escape

36:41.280 --> 36:44.240
from a locked cell?

36:44.280 --> 36:51.040
Detective Inspector, can I introduce you to Detective

36:44.280 --> 36:51.040
Sergeant Camille Bordey?

36:51.080 --> 36:53.080
Born in Sainte-Marie, trained in Paris,

36:53.120 --> 36:56.840
but for the last two years has been working

36:53.120 --> 36:56.840
undercover on Guadeloupe.

36:56.880 --> 37:00.480
-Making the case against James Lavender.

36:56.880 --> 37:00.480
-And she's back on the island.

37:00.520 --> 37:02.840
Because I'm days away from an arrest,

37:00.520 --> 37:02.840
so I'd appreciate if you...

37:02.880 --> 37:05.080
I'm sorry, there's an undercover

37:02.880 --> 37:05.080
police officer on this island

37:05.120 --> 37:07.640
working the same case and you didn't

37:05.120 --> 37:07.640
think to tell me?

37:07.680 --> 37:10.600
We couldn't. Camille reckons there's a corrupt policeman

37:10.640 --> 37:12.520
helping James Lavender. We couldn't take the risk.

37:12.560 --> 37:13.760
It's not likely to be me, is it?

37:13.800 --> 37:17.520
I've been in Croydon for the last 13 years!

37:17.560 --> 37:22.200
And if you're looking for your corrupt copper,

37:17.560 --> 37:22.200
it was Charlie Hulme.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.400
-I've got a box

37:22.240 --> 37:24.400
full of evidence

37:24.440 --> 37:27.520
linking Charlie to human trafficking

37:24.440 --> 37:27.520
and James Lavender's yacht.

37:27.560 --> 37:29.720
Charlie was clearly James' right-hand man.

37:29.760 --> 37:32.640
Then we need to go in hard, sir, arrest James

37:29.760 --> 37:32.640
Lavender right now.

37:32.680 --> 37:34.240
-Small problem. -Don't tell me,

37:34.280 --> 37:36.800
there is some form we have to fill in

37:34.280 --> 37:36.800
first in triplicate?

37:38.920 --> 37:41.320
James Lavender's dead.

37:41.360 --> 37:44.840
Looks like suicide, but either way,

37:41.360 --> 37:44.840
as far as this case goes,

37:44.880 --> 37:49.320
Charlie Hulme's a dead end and now,

37:44.880 --> 37:49.320
so too is James Lavender.

37:57.040 --> 38:00.040
This place.

38:00.080 --> 38:03.480
Sir, look, you know, if James killed Charlie and then

38:00.080 --> 38:03.480
killed himself,

38:03.520 --> 38:06.400
I can take over from here, finish the paperwork.

38:06.440 --> 38:08.640
You could be on the next plane out of here.

38:08.680 --> 38:11.280
Oh, don't. I'm imagining it now.

38:11.320 --> 38:15.000
Walking out at Heathrow. Being cold.

38:15.040 --> 38:18.600
Finally being cold again. You know,

38:15.040 --> 38:18.600
I never thought I'd miss it.

38:18.640 --> 38:20.680
-Drizzle.

38:20.720 --> 38:23.720
That feeling on your face, like a wet flannel.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.800
Oh, England!

38:25.840 --> 38:27.360
Problem is we may know what happened

38:27.400 --> 38:29.840
but we still don't really know how it happened.

38:29.880 --> 38:33.440
How was Charlie killed from inside a locked panic room?

38:33.480 --> 38:37.280
Lily, I need you to stay here and conclude the interviews.

38:33.480 --> 38:37.280
Fidel!

38:37.320 --> 38:39.400
-You're with me. -Yes, sir.

38:42.920 --> 38:46.120
-I don't believe it.

38:46.160 --> 38:50.480
-You do not ever

38:46.160 --> 38:50.480
want to know how long.

38:50.520 --> 38:54.200
Okay, that seems about right. It took me...

38:50.520 --> 38:54.200
This wasn't knocked over.

38:54.240 --> 38:58.600
Look. Here and here. It was shot,

38:58.640 --> 39:01.840
from slightly above and angling downwards.

39:01.880 --> 39:06.880
Now, if you go over towards the desk,

39:01.880 --> 39:06.880
let's say you're James.

39:06.920 --> 39:09.440
-At this stage, all I know

39:09.480 --> 39:13.400
is that somebody shot this vase, but with a .22

39:09.480 --> 39:13.400
bullet or a .38?

39:13.440 --> 39:15.000
That's the question.

39:15.040 --> 39:18.160
The whole case rather depends on us finding the answer.

39:18.200 --> 39:21.880
So, if you just hold that absolutely still,

39:21.920 --> 39:24.600
let's find out where the bullet went.

39:45.360 --> 39:49.000
You need to watch out for snakes, sir. They can be in

39:45.360 --> 39:49.000
the trees sometimes, too.

39:57.960 --> 40:00.480
-Sir! -God!

40:00.520 --> 40:04.160
I thought you were... Where have you been?

40:04.200 --> 40:07.720
I figured the tortoise would get there a whole lot quicker

40:04.200 --> 40:07.720
with a metal detector.

40:41.120 --> 40:43.560
Finally. Proof.

40:43.600 --> 40:47.240
The bullet that shot the vase on the night of the murder

40:43.600 --> 40:47.240
was a .38 calibre.

40:47.280 --> 40:50.600
Fired by a bloody loud service revolver.

40:54.320 --> 40:55.760
Oh, no, not again.

40:56.680 --> 40:59.320
Yes, what

40:59.360 --> 41:03.600
No, no, no. Start again. My luggage.

41:03.640 --> 41:06.120
What do you mean it's still in Heathrow?

41:03.640 --> 41:06.120
You lost it in Sainte-Marie.

41:08.400 --> 41:10.080
Hey? Oh!

41:12.080 --> 41:13.400
Oh, I see.

41:15.200 --> 41:17.840
No, sorry. Just, uh, keep it in Heathrow, please

41:17.880 --> 41:21.120
and I'll be back soon.

41:21.160 --> 41:23.360
In fact, I'll be on the next plane

41:21.160 --> 41:23.360
out of here.

41:25.120 --> 41:27.720
You okay there, sir?

41:27.760 --> 41:30.120
They never put my luggage on the plane.

41:31.720 --> 41:33.680
Yeah!

41:33.720 --> 41:36.440
Yes, of course! Ah!

41:36.480 --> 41:39.080
It's the heat. It's finally got

41:36.480 --> 41:39.080
the better of him.

41:39.120 --> 41:41.800
-She fired the gun and then... -Should I call

41:39.120 --> 41:41.800
for an ambulance?

41:41.840 --> 41:44.080
Yes! You do!

41:44.120 --> 41:46.680
Of course! Thank you, Fidel. Yes!

41:46.720 --> 41:50.000
Okay. So, that phone call and then,

41:50.040 --> 41:52.520
into the sea with you.

41:52.560 --> 41:56.120
Brilliant! Brilliant! Leaving

41:52.560 --> 41:56.120
the murderer for you to...

41:57.360 --> 41:59.040
...commit murder.

41:59.080 --> 42:01.280
Uh, just loosen your tie a moment there, sir.

42:01.320 --> 42:03.000
It's very, very simple. Call the ambulance.

42:05.400 --> 42:07.640
No, call the Commissioner. He's going to need to be

42:05.400 --> 42:07.640
here for the arrest.

42:07.680 --> 42:10.960
Okay, you said it. Better get the Commissioner here

42:07.680 --> 42:10.960
as soon as possible.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.320
What killed him in the first place?

42:11.000 --> 42:13.320
That's the question.

42:15.480 --> 42:17.640
But then, if the bullet's not the bullet...

42:18.840 --> 42:20.280
What if...

42:22.960 --> 42:26.520
Yes! -How many fingers

42:22.960 --> 42:26.520
am I holding up, sir?

42:26.560 --> 42:30.400
Fidel, James Lavender had a mobile phone on him when

42:26.560 --> 42:30.400
he died. Get it for me.

42:30.440 --> 42:34.080
I'm also going to need the .22 pistol he was holding when

42:30.440 --> 42:34.080
we found his body.

42:34.120 --> 42:36.160
And while you're getting them,

42:36.200 --> 42:38.560
you and me, Dwayne, we're going to

42:36.200 --> 42:38.560
have a little chat.

42:46.680 --> 42:49.520
You know, I should have realised the lessons of

42:46.680 --> 42:49.520
my luggage sooner.

42:49.560 --> 42:51.360
Your luggage?

42:51.400 --> 42:54.200
See, my case was never loaded onto the plane.

42:51.400 --> 42:54.200
It remained in Heathrow.

42:54.240 --> 42:56.040
So when the hold was opened in Sainte-Marie,

42:56.080 --> 42:58.080
it looked as though it had disappeared.

42:58.120 --> 43:01.720
Whereas, in reality, it was never

42:58.120 --> 43:01.720
in there in the first place.

43:01.760 --> 43:04.000
-The same way that

43:01.760 --> 43:04.000
when the panic room

43:04.040 --> 43:08.040
was opened, we thought the killer had disappeared,

43:04.040 --> 43:08.040
but in reality,

43:08.080 --> 43:09.280
the murderer was never in there.

43:09.320 --> 43:11.920
Please just tell me who killed Charlie.

43:11.960 --> 43:15.560
When Charlie investigated your husband, he set in motion

43:11.960 --> 43:15.560
a chain of events

43:15.600 --> 43:19.840
that would lead to his murder and your husband's.

43:19.880 --> 43:22.640
RICHARD:<i> On the night of the</i> <i>party, I think James</i>

43:19.880 --> 43:22.640
<i>discovered Charlie</i>

43:22.680 --> 43:24.720
<i>in the panic room and</i> <i>realised he had to kill him.</i>

43:27.240 --> 43:29.800
<i>The only problem being</i> <i>James doesn't know his way</i>

43:29.840 --> 43:32.120
<i>around a gun, as he told us.</i>

43:32.160 --> 43:35.080
So he only managed to shoot the vase,

43:35.120 --> 43:38.600
at which point Charlie does the only logical thing

43:35.120 --> 43:38.600
and locks himself

43:38.640 --> 43:42.720
safely inside the panic room.

43:42.760 --> 43:45.240
<i>Now, James has just tried to</i> <i>kill a policeman,</i>

43:42.760 --> 43:45.240
<i>so what does he do?</i>

43:47.040 --> 43:50.760
He goes back to his beach, where I presume he disposed

43:50.800 --> 43:53.960
of the service revolver before making a call.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.520
In fact, he must have made a phone call.

43:56.560 --> 43:59.840
He didn't kill Charlie Hulme, so who did he get to do it?

43:59.880 --> 44:03.400
-You can't be sure it wasn't James.

43:59.880 --> 44:03.400
-I can.

44:03.440 --> 44:06.280
James only managed to shoot a vase

44:06.320 --> 44:09.640
using your service revolver, the only gunshot that was

44:06.320 --> 44:09.640
heard on the night.

44:10.680 --> 44:12.920
Don't you see what this means?

44:12.960 --> 44:17.120
We have no way of knowing when Charlie was killed

44:12.960 --> 44:17.120
because nobody heard

44:17.160 --> 44:20.040
the .22 gunshot that killed him.

44:20.080 --> 44:22.960
In fact, he could have been killed at any time on

44:20.080 --> 44:22.960
the night of the murder.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.680
So are you saying he was killed before the panic

44:23.000 --> 44:26.680
room was shut down?

44:26.720 --> 44:29.920
-No, sir.

44:29.960 --> 44:33.720
I know who the murderer is and so do you,

44:29.960 --> 44:33.720
Sergeant Thomson,

44:33.760 --> 44:35.400
'cause it's you.

44:41.160 --> 44:42.880
No. Dwayne.

44:42.920 --> 44:45.680
-You quickly realised killing Charlie...

44:45.720 --> 44:47.680
...only bought you time. Isn't that right?

44:47.720 --> 44:49.520
<i>How did the murderer</i> <i>kill Charlie Hulme</i>

44:49.560 --> 44:52.040
<i>and then escape from a</i> <i>locked steel room?</i>

44:49.560 --> 44:52.040
<i>It's impossible.</i>

44:52.080 --> 44:55.040
What you needed next was a sacrificial

44:52.080 --> 44:55.040
lamb, so you planted

44:55.080 --> 44:57.080
a safety deposit key in my bungalow,

44:57.120 --> 45:00.040
knowing that I'd find it the next time I showered.

45:00.080 --> 45:01.400
<i>I mean, how many</i> <i>showers do you have a day?</i>

45:03.720 --> 45:06.680
'Cause once I had the key, you could then lead me to

45:03.720 --> 45:06.680
the safety deposit box

45:06.720 --> 45:09.480
with all the evidence you'd planted

45:06.720 --> 45:09.480
to create supposed links

45:09.520 --> 45:14.360
between Charlie Hulme, human trafficking

45:09.520 --> 45:14.360
and James Lavender,

45:14.400 --> 45:17.720
who you killed before picking up the warrant for us

45:14.400 --> 45:17.720
to search his yacht.

45:31.960 --> 45:35.520
Charlie was found shot dead inside a locked panic room,

45:31.960 --> 45:35.520
on his own,

45:35.560 --> 45:38.400
no gun nearby. If you think

45:35.560 --> 45:38.400
about it logically,

45:38.440 --> 45:41.680
as he's the only person found inside,

45:38.440 --> 45:41.680
he must have been alive

45:41.720 --> 45:44.080
when the room was locked down.

45:44.120 --> 45:46.400
Who else could have shut that door down apart from him?

45:46.440 --> 45:48.600
He's the only person found in there.

45:48.640 --> 45:51.640
And if he was alive when he locked the room down...

45:51.680 --> 45:54.000
LILY:<i> So, everybody out</i> <i>and don't touch anything.</i>

45:54.040 --> 45:58.200
RICHARD:<i> ...he must have also</i> <i>been alive when Sergeant</i>

45:54.040 --> 45:58.200
<i>Thomson opened it up.</i>

46:03.120 --> 46:06.880
Even if he was dead within seconds of her

46:03.120 --> 46:06.880
arriving on the scene.

46:06.920 --> 46:09.680
You see, this wasn't an impossible murder,

46:09.720 --> 46:11.480
it merely happened after the police arrived.

46:12.400 --> 46:14.360
Isn't that so, Sergeant?

46:14.400 --> 46:17.000
Now, I wonder who James rang that night,

46:17.040 --> 46:19.840
having just attempted to murder a British policeman?

46:21.160 --> 46:24.560
Ah. Why, here we are.

46:24.600 --> 46:26.320
Because if he rang you, Sergeant,

46:24.600 --> 46:26.320
that's going to be

46:26.360 --> 46:29.120
pretty incriminating, don't you think?

46:29.160 --> 46:31.360


46:45.840 --> 46:47.320
Hello?

46:47.360 --> 46:50.320
So why did he ring you? If not to say that

46:47.360 --> 46:50.320
Charlie was going

46:50.360 --> 46:52.080
to take you both down unless you took him out?

46:55.240 --> 46:57.920
Why would I kill Charlie Hulme?

46:57.960 --> 47:01.280
Are you saying women don't kill people?

47:01.320 --> 47:04.000
Because the book Charlie was holding, the book he'd just

47:01.320 --> 47:04.000
got from the safe,

47:04.040 --> 47:06.200
and which was about to put you and James in prison.

47:06.240 --> 47:08.440
The book he was holding was a travel guide.

47:08.480 --> 47:10.880
-Yes, it was.

47:10.920 --> 47:14.440
And yet, with this case, nothing has been as it seems.

47:14.480 --> 47:17.760
The gun that was heard on the night wasn't the gun

47:14.480 --> 47:17.760
that killed Charlie,

47:17.800 --> 47:20.880
the bullet that was fired wasn't the bullet

47:17.800 --> 47:20.880
that killed Charlie.

47:20.920 --> 47:24.800
So, this is what I suddenly thought. What if the book

47:20.920 --> 47:24.800
Charlie was holding

47:24.840 --> 47:27.160
wasn't the book Charlie was holding?

47:27.200 --> 47:28.680
LILY:<i> It's Charlie Hulme.</i>

47:28.720 --> 47:30.560
Imagine the book Charlie was holding was incriminating

47:30.600 --> 47:32.480
and you're Lily. What do you do?

47:32.520 --> 47:35.320
Well, you clear the crime scene,

47:32.520 --> 47:35.320
of course, standard procedure.

47:35.360 --> 47:36.440
But then what?

47:36.480 --> 47:38.480
<i>Call an ambulance. Now!</i>

47:38.520 --> 47:42.400
Everyone's seen the book in Charlie's hand. You can't

47:38.520 --> 47:42.400
very well remove it,

47:42.440 --> 47:46.600
so you swap it for any book on these shelves

47:42.440 --> 47:46.600
that looks the same.

47:46.640 --> 47:50.320
The innocent book going into Charlie's hands

47:50.360 --> 47:53.840
and the incriminating book going back on the shelves,

47:53.880 --> 47:57.000
concealed amongst all these others.

47:57.040 --> 47:59.280
Hidden in plain view, as it were.

47:59.320 --> 48:02.280
What's more, I reckon I can do this in one.

48:06.760 --> 48:10.080
Ah. Charlie Hulme's blood on this.

48:12.800 --> 48:16.240
Everything you'd need to prove James' involvement in

48:12.800 --> 48:16.240
human trafficking.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.040
This was the only one with no writing

48:21.000 --> 48:24.040
down the spine.

48:24.080 --> 48:26.920
I imagine you were planning to come back

48:24.080 --> 48:26.920
sometime and retrieve it?

48:27.840 --> 48:30.440
Oh! Your name's in here.

48:30.480 --> 48:33.160
All the way through, in fact,

48:33.200 --> 48:37.760
and there's a fingerprint in Charlie Hulme's blood.

48:33.200 --> 48:37.760
I mean, logically,

48:37.800 --> 48:40.040
if you think about it, that's going to be

48:37.800 --> 48:40.040
quite hard to explain

48:40.080 --> 48:41.280
if it turns out to be yours.

48:43.360 --> 48:44.800
You know, I have to take my hat off to you.

48:44.840 --> 48:47.160
You had me pointing this way and that from the start.

48:48.800 --> 48:53.200
And there were times, I must confess,

48:48.800 --> 48:53.200
when you were dazzling.

48:53.240 --> 48:56.040
You killed two people. Why?

48:59.680 --> 49:02.720
You know how many times I've been passed over?

49:02.760 --> 49:05.880
Someone sent from London to do a job I should be doing?

49:06.680 --> 49:09.120
Charlie Hulme and now him?

49:09.160 --> 49:11.680
So if I'm not good enough,

49:11.720 --> 49:14.920
why not take the money instead and a lot of it?

49:14.960 --> 49:19.440
Enough to get away from this. Away from you.

49:19.480 --> 49:21.280
There's a whole world out there, you know, Fidel.

49:21.320 --> 49:24.640
Problem is I don't think you'll ever get to leave

49:21.320 --> 49:24.640
this island again.

49:24.680 --> 49:27.240
Dwayne, Fidel, if you would.

49:28.160 --> 49:29.840
Sure thing, Chief.

49:35.480 --> 49:36.480
Hmm.

50:02.240 --> 50:04.280
What if I'd trodden on you?

50:07.120 --> 50:09.920
No point looking at me like that.

50:07.120 --> 50:09.920
I'm off.

50:26.520 --> 50:29.080
So, my super in London arranges

50:26.520 --> 50:29.080
for me to be posted here,

50:29.120 --> 50:31.160
you agree to it, and it's not a stitch

50:31.200 --> 50:35.160
Of course not. It's just a sensible

50:31.200 --> 50:35.160
reallocation of resources.

50:35.200 --> 50:37.880
Look, don't get me wrong, I'm sure

50:35.200 --> 50:37.880
the Caribbean's great,

50:37.920 --> 50:41.160
beach holidays and snorkelling, but I can't work

50:37.920 --> 50:41.160
here, let alone live here.

50:41.200 --> 50:42.640
I don't know if anybody's noticed

50:42.680 --> 50:45.520
but there's a tree growing through my front room!

50:47.240 --> 50:49.280
-I've got no luggage. -Ah!

50:51.600 --> 50:53.120
-You know how your luggage

50:53.160 --> 50:55.200
was left at Heathrow?

51:02.680 --> 51:04.840
Any other bombshells I should know about?

51:04.880 --> 51:07.200
Of course not. No.

51:07.240 --> 51:09.240
Well, maybe one.

51:14.080 --> 51:16.240
-No. -Tell me about it.

51:16.280 --> 51:18.200
-You're undercover! -Was undercover.

51:18.240 --> 51:20.280
You kind of blew that when you

51:18.240 --> 51:20.280
arrested me, remember?

51:20.320 --> 51:23.320
-Come on, no one knows you're a copper.

51:20.320 --> 51:23.320
-I do.

51:23.360 --> 51:25.440
-And if a crook

51:23.360 --> 51:25.440
like Marlon knows,

51:25.480 --> 51:27.920
then everyone in the underworld will know she's a

51:25.480 --> 51:27.920
copper, my brethren.

51:27.960 --> 51:31.000
Yes you are!

51:34.920 --> 51:36.560
-I'm trying. -Try harder.

51:36.600 --> 51:38.160
-I can't work with her. -I can't work with him.

51:38.200 --> 51:41.920
The paperwork is done. You're both staying.

51:41.960 --> 51:45.040
So, as Commissioner, and I'm very pleased to say,

51:45.080 --> 51:48.800
on behalf of the Royal

51:45.080 --> 51:48.800
Sainte-Marie Police Force,
