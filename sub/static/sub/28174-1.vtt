SAVING LENINGRAD

01:22.146 --> 01:25.812
I'm sorry, but I don't have
a single photo of him.

01:27.604 --> 01:29.604
I was head over heels in love with him.

01:30.854 --> 01:35.062
It was because of Kostya Gorelov that
I happened to be on that ill-fated barge.

01:35.104 --> 01:38.646
I can remember that evening: the cold,
the shore of Lake Ladoga,

01:38.687 --> 01:42.104
the brick building, and the tiny
photographer's parlor.

01:42.562 --> 01:44.937
I was wearing someone else's footwraps.

01:45.604 --> 01:48.687
Kostya was sitting.
I was standing next to him.

01:49.979 --> 01:51.854
The photographer said: "Say cheese!"

01:51.896 --> 01:55.479
But we didn't even have enough
money to pay for the photograph.

01:56.521 --> 01:58.854
In an hour, he'd go up the front.

01:59.062 --> 02:00.646
He gave me his watch

02:01.646 --> 02:04.062
so that I could pawn it in the morning

02:04.729 --> 02:08.521
and buy the photograph
from the photographer with that money.

02:09.312 --> 02:10.854
That night

02:12.937 --> 02:14.937
there was an air raid.

02:15.437 --> 02:17.354
A bomb hit the house.

02:18.979 --> 02:20.354
Everything burned up:

02:21.771 --> 02:24.354
photographs, negatives.

02:31.354 --> 02:34.521
And this is all that was left.

02:45.312 --> 02:47.271
It's 80 years old.

02:47.312 --> 02:49.021
It's never been repaired.

02:49.604 --> 02:51.146
It's still running.

03:06.187 --> 03:07.437
Make way!

03:23.771 --> 03:26.187
I can't imagine you living alone there -

03:26.396 --> 03:30.146
when evacuated, in another place,
in another city after Leningrad.

03:33.562 --> 03:36.729
My dad used to say that to move
somewhere from St. Petersburg

03:36.854 --> 03:39.396
is like an animal changing its habitat.

03:40.187 --> 03:42.521
It's like making an elephant
live underwater.

03:42.604 --> 03:43.687
It's impossible.

03:44.562 --> 03:48.021
And you haven't been anywhere
farther than the Summer Garden.

04:18.729 --> 04:21.437
I didn't know that you're going together.

04:25.479 --> 04:26.812
Mom, don't be offended.

04:26.979 --> 04:28.271
I'm not offended but

04:28.354 --> 04:32.271
if you decided to get married, then I
think I should at least be aware of that.

04:32.354 --> 04:34.937
Why did you decide that
I'm going to get married?

04:35.062 --> 04:37.771
At your age,
going on a trip with a man

04:37.937 --> 04:39.146
means a lot.

04:43.729 --> 04:45.479
Don't do anything stupid.

04:49.104 --> 04:50.146
Okay.

04:51.521 --> 04:53.062
Take care, too, mom.

04:53.271 --> 04:55.104
I'll be okay because I'm home.

04:55.562 --> 04:57.354
And who knows where you'll be.

05:01.104 --> 05:02.187
Mom, I have to go.

05:03.646 --> 05:05.479
Go, I'm not holding you here.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.604
Remember that I have nobody but you.

05:17.021 --> 05:18.146
Go faster.

05:19.021 --> 05:20.646
They are waiting for us.

05:36.979 --> 05:38.062
My fault.

05:45.396 --> 05:46.396
Let's go!

05:52.354 --> 05:55.021
How much time did I give you?
You're an hour late.

05:55.104 --> 05:56.854
It's 45 minutes, Comrade Sergeant.

05:56.937 --> 05:59.771
Three extra duties
for unauthorized absence.

05:59.937 --> 06:01.104
Will comply.

06:11.854 --> 06:13.687
Hello. You've returned?

06:14.229 --> 06:16.979
Well, thank you, we can say so.

06:24.896 --> 06:26.062
Sasha?

06:26.687 --> 06:28.396
Did you see Nastya?

06:28.979 --> 06:31.104
Oh, God, what am I saying? Come in.

06:31.312 --> 06:33.687
I'll stay just for five minutes.
Hello, Maria.

06:34.437 --> 06:35.562
Hello.

06:39.062 --> 06:40.646
I was granted amnesty.

06:40.896 --> 06:44.646
It turned out that the ruling
was signed a year ago

06:44.687 --> 06:47.687
but somebody mistook the article
in my case for another

06:47.729 --> 06:49.771
so it took a while to figure it out.

06:52.729 --> 06:54.187
So, Nastya isn't here.

06:54.729 --> 06:57.646
Nastya just left, it was just
a moment before you came.

06:57.771 --> 07:02.187
I thought she came back
to grab what she forgot here.

07:03.562 --> 07:04.562
Come in.

07:05.854 --> 07:10.229
You know, it's the fourth day that
we've been living without electricity.

07:11.354 --> 07:13.562
We sit in the dark in the evening.

07:21.312 --> 07:24.521
Our daughter is going to get married.

07:25.729 --> 07:27.687
To Kostya Gorelov, a cadet.

07:28.771 --> 07:30.562
They met a month ago,

07:31.354 --> 07:33.104
and she fell in love with him.

07:33.146 --> 07:35.479
Are they really going to send you
to the front?

07:35.521 --> 07:38.396
I wish I'd seen my daughter.

07:39.396 --> 07:40.812
You haven't seen her.

07:41.562 --> 07:42.937
She left.

07:43.062 --> 07:45.646
That's not my fault.
She's got your temper.

07:45.937 --> 07:49.062
-Will you have dinner?
-I don't have time for that.

07:50.812 --> 07:52.562
She left.

07:52.896 --> 07:54.104
You're leaving.

07:54.646 --> 07:55.812
And what about me?

08:05.479 --> 08:06.854
Have you forgiven me?

08:09.521 --> 08:10.562
It was my daughter.

08:12.354 --> 08:14.562
I disowned you only for her sake.

08:16.271 --> 08:18.437
You were gone, and we had to live on.

08:19.562 --> 08:22.937
As a wife of an enemy of the people,
I could lose my job.

08:25.104 --> 08:26.146
Of course.

08:29.812 --> 08:31.521
I just...

08:31.562 --> 08:32.729
You're already late.

08:32.771 --> 08:35.146
Here's a potato, put it in your pocket.

08:38.562 --> 08:39.646
Sugar.

08:46.979 --> 08:48.062
Keys.

08:48.146 --> 08:51.562
You should have a set of keys.
They'll give you days off, right?

08:53.854 --> 08:54.979
It's time.

08:55.354 --> 08:56.562
I have to go.

08:58.687 --> 08:59.979
I'll see you off.

09:02.771 --> 09:04.896
Oh God, what a terrible day it is!

09:26.687 --> 09:28.979
The whole of the city is under siege.

09:29.187 --> 09:33.312
According to our data, there are over
two million people in Leningrad right now.

09:33.396 --> 09:37.062
One week ago, we destroyed
the largest food depots there.

09:37.437 --> 09:40.937
If we keep the city under siege,
they'll eat all of the food reserves,

09:40.979 --> 09:43.146
and famine will begin in a month.

09:43.312 --> 09:45.771
What could interfere with our plans?

09:48.854 --> 09:50.396
Lake Ladoga.

09:51.312 --> 09:54.896
It's a big lake, and
we can't blockade it like the Neva.

09:55.437 --> 09:58.354
We've blocked the entire
Russian Fleet there.

09:58.854 --> 10:02.896
The Russians realize that and are trying
to establish a water route

10:02.979 --> 10:06.479
over the Ladoga, which they'll use
to continue to evacuate people

10:06.562 --> 10:07.687
from Leningrad.

10:08.271 --> 10:12.229
How would they accomplish that?
You said their fleet is blocked.

10:13.896 --> 10:18.021
Yes, but on the Ladoga,
there are a few old vessels.

10:19.271 --> 10:20.479
They're barges.

10:21.521 --> 10:25.646
There are about a dozen of them, some of
them are decommissioned and unserviceable.

10:25.729 --> 10:28.312
But they'll use them
because the Russians

10:28.354 --> 10:31.104
have no other options
to arrange a crossing.

10:31.271 --> 10:35.271
There have been more columns moving
from the city to the shore of Lake Ladoga

10:35.312 --> 10:36.479
in the last few days.

10:36.521 --> 10:38.354
We're keeping track of this route.

10:38.396 --> 10:41.812
We launched an airstrike here
two hours ago, near Irinovka.

10:42.562 --> 10:43.646
Okay.

11:00.979 --> 11:02.729
Good done, Gorelov!

11:05.021 --> 11:06.937
We can't embark all of those wish to.

11:07.229 --> 11:10.396
The barge will flounder
with so many people aboard.

11:10.521 --> 11:13.437
Well, everything will probably be alright.
Let's assume that.

11:13.521 --> 11:14.604
But what if it won't?

11:14.687 --> 11:16.437
What if everything won't be alright?

11:16.479 --> 11:19.021
Does it mean that we'll drown people?
Am I right?

11:19.104 --> 11:21.812
My son, a cadet, will be on that barge.

11:22.104 --> 11:24.646
Do you think that I want to risk his life?

11:26.979 --> 11:28.854
We need to ship people.

11:29.604 --> 11:31.354
The berth is overcrowded now.

11:31.979 --> 11:35.604
If we manage to sail today, it means
there's a way to save ourselves.

11:35.646 --> 11:37.771
If we don't, we'll die from famine.

11:38.854 --> 11:40.146
That's the point.

11:42.354 --> 11:44.771
We need to put out at night
when we're less likely

11:44.812 --> 11:46.479
to be attacked by their air force

11:46.604 --> 11:48.604
and try to make it while it's dark.

11:49.062 --> 11:50.979
We won't make it while it's dark.

11:51.354 --> 11:53.396
The journey will take about 12 hours.

11:53.854 --> 11:55.604
It's now dark from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m.

11:56.562 --> 11:57.812
That's ten hours.

11:59.312 --> 12:01.729
We have to make it in ten hours, captain.

12:02.771 --> 12:04.187
I'm telling you again;

12:04.896 --> 12:08.354
we need a way to save Leningrad,
and it has to be found.

12:10.729 --> 12:13.062
How many people will you
take aboard, captain?

12:13.229 --> 12:14.604
For a risk-free journey.

12:15.896 --> 12:17.562
About 600 people, no more.

12:18.146 --> 12:22.354
Have I understood you correctly
that this is without freight, captain?

12:23.687 --> 12:24.687
Right.

12:25.271 --> 12:26.896
I fully agree.

12:28.479 --> 12:29.937
1,500.

12:32.187 --> 12:34.396
Cadets, officers, plus vehicles.

12:37.937 --> 12:40.396
The barge will sink,
Comrade Military Commissar.

12:40.479 --> 12:42.312
I understand everything, the evacuation.

12:42.354 --> 12:44.312
I understand that there's no other way.

12:44.354 --> 12:46.354
But there'll be people, damn it!

12:46.396 --> 12:50.604
I know the 752 like the back of my hand
because we shipped cattle on it.

12:51.062 --> 12:52.521
The rivets come off it.

12:52.562 --> 12:54.312
All of it is decayed, I swear.

12:54.729 --> 12:56.396
I don't need to lie to you.

12:57.521 --> 12:59.187
This vessel will flounder.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.312
The first wave will tear it into pieces.

13:01.437 --> 13:03.562
Where did you see a wave, captain?

13:05.062 --> 13:06.271
It's dead calm.

13:06.896 --> 13:08.021
Dear comrades,

13:09.604 --> 13:11.687
the question is simple:

13:12.562 --> 13:14.812
who will be responsible
if anything happens?

13:14.854 --> 13:16.854
Let's decide and designate a person.

13:16.896 --> 13:19.854
And this person will tell us
whether he'll take this risk or not.

13:19.896 --> 13:22.729
If you're talking about risks,
I'll tell you again,

13:22.771 --> 13:24.646
my son will be on that barge.

13:25.146 --> 13:27.437
He's an artillery school student.

13:27.562 --> 13:29.937
His surname, Gorelov, is on the list.

13:30.896 --> 13:32.604
Load the barge to the brim.

13:33.104 --> 13:35.646
I assume responsibility. That's it.

14:12.062 --> 14:14.687
Your rear sight is wrong,
Comrade Sergeant.

14:15.437 --> 14:16.896
Shut up, cadet.

14:38.771 --> 14:41.312
Go, my darling, just go.

14:43.354 --> 14:44.437
Let's go.

14:50.604 --> 14:52.854
Go to the barge. I'll find you there.

14:53.854 --> 14:54.854
Okay.

15:02.479 --> 15:04.271
Guys, who took my footwraps?

15:12.812 --> 15:14.646
You'll clean toilets without a break.

15:14.687 --> 15:17.562
I, the combat sergeant,
am telling you this.

15:18.646 --> 15:20.354
I hate nepotism.

15:20.604 --> 15:23.062
I'm sorry, Comrade Sergeant.

15:24.229 --> 15:26.604
Company, fall in!

15:28.646 --> 15:29.937
Ten seconds.

15:31.104 --> 15:34.479
Comrades, listen to me attentively.

15:35.437 --> 15:38.104
The loading procedure will be as follows:

15:38.521 --> 15:40.812
the civilians will be the last to go.

15:41.604 --> 15:44.062
The schools' personnel will go first.

15:44.729 --> 15:47.521
Naval Medical Academy,
proceed to the barge.

15:49.104 --> 15:51.979
Civilians will go afterward,
if there's room for them,

15:52.021 --> 15:53.437
on a special command.

15:53.771 --> 15:55.354
Go, go, go!

15:57.896 --> 15:59.562
There are so many of them.

16:00.604 --> 16:02.146
Pomerantseva.

16:02.854 --> 16:03.854
Step aside.

16:11.562 --> 16:13.437
I'm telling you again, listen to me.

16:14.646 --> 16:17.021
The military goes first.

16:17.062 --> 16:18.687
Civilians, step to the right.

16:18.729 --> 16:20.521
Step to the right, stay out of the way.

16:20.562 --> 16:23.604
Comrade Sergeant, may I step out
just for five minutes?

16:24.604 --> 16:27.729
-Where? To see your father?
-No, but I really need to.

16:28.021 --> 16:30.729
Put suitcases and other
luggage on the back.

16:30.771 --> 16:33.896
The crew will put it away so that
if there's a wave,

16:34.396 --> 16:36.354
nothing will be swept overboard.

16:36.479 --> 16:39.104
Don't stand in the way.
Wait for the order.

16:39.729 --> 16:40.937
Go. Go. Go.

16:41.062 --> 16:43.146
-I'll take you there.
-They won't let me.

16:43.229 --> 16:44.812
Why? Move on.

16:45.146 --> 16:47.479
Make way, comrades. Step aside.

16:47.729 --> 16:49.854
We have a special boarding pass.

16:51.812 --> 16:53.562
Madame, follow us.

16:53.979 --> 16:55.187
Thank you, son.

16:55.604 --> 16:56.562
Greetings!

16:56.646 --> 17:00.729
Lady, I've told you that the military goes
first, go down and wait for the command.

17:00.771 --> 17:02.187
Lady, step back.

17:02.354 --> 17:03.687
But my suitcase.

17:03.771 --> 17:04.979
She's with me.

17:06.604 --> 17:07.937
Okay, go.

17:08.604 --> 17:09.646
Leave the luggage.

17:09.687 --> 17:10.979
The old lady is with me, too.

17:11.021 --> 17:13.271
No, no, no. Your old man will execute me.

17:13.312 --> 17:15.271
Madam, I'll fix the handle later.

17:15.312 --> 17:16.812
Madam, go back.

17:16.854 --> 17:17.896
Keep up the pace.

17:17.937 --> 17:20.229
-Medics, how many of you are there?
-340.

17:22.437 --> 17:24.729
Lady, all of the luggage
must be left up there.

17:24.771 --> 17:26.729
You can't take your luggage into the hold.

17:26.771 --> 17:29.729
-What are you doing? This is my suitcase.
-Please, give it to me.

17:29.771 --> 17:31.896
She has a special boarding pass.

17:34.687 --> 17:36.354
Do you know who she is?

17:36.437 --> 17:37.479
Who?

17:38.104 --> 17:40.062
She's Admiral Makarov's daughter.

17:42.937 --> 17:45.771
They're running back and
forth like cockroaches.

17:58.271 --> 17:59.312
Go there.

18:08.187 --> 18:10.896
Keep calm, comrades. Where are you going?

18:12.396 --> 18:16.062
You can go up there only
with the Section Commander's permission.

18:16.437 --> 18:17.479
Good luck!

18:18.979 --> 18:21.229
Telegraph me from Novaya Ladoga.

18:21.437 --> 18:22.521
Sure.

18:24.562 --> 18:26.646
So long, Comrade Captain 1st rank!

18:26.729 --> 18:28.937
And forgive me if something happens.

18:31.146 --> 18:33.104
So much depends on you, captain.

18:33.479 --> 18:35.812
I'll try to make it while it's dark.

18:36.854 --> 18:40.104
Send your son to my tugboat.

18:40.521 --> 18:41.979
It's safer there.

18:42.104 --> 18:43.062
No.

18:43.312 --> 18:47.229
I want him to stay with others.
I don't go back on my word. Good luck.

18:50.229 --> 18:51.646
We're casting off!

18:52.271 --> 18:56.354
We have no other options.
This isn't our first time, damn it.

18:56.812 --> 18:58.729
Go check the oil on the tugboat.

18:58.812 --> 19:01.771
-Add some oil if necessary.
-Will comply, commander.

19:02.687 --> 19:06.146
Boy, I'll rip your feet off.

19:06.187 --> 19:07.604
Watch out, old man.

19:13.146 --> 19:17.437
During the voyage, one hour after
we cast off, the holds will be locked.

19:18.396 --> 19:22.021
There must be no one in military
uniform on the deck

19:22.646 --> 19:24.562
for the purpose of conspiracy.

19:24.854 --> 19:27.729
- Am I understood?
- Yes, sir!

19:49.229 --> 19:52.771
What do you think? You won't find
a better place on this barge.

20:03.729 --> 20:05.437
Do you kiss everyone like that?

20:05.521 --> 20:06.771
No, only you.

20:07.062 --> 20:09.271
You lie so often that I don't believe you.

20:09.312 --> 20:11.521
Why? Maybe I want to marry you?

20:13.479 --> 20:16.146
And I'm not lying but
solving a particular problem.

20:16.271 --> 20:17.771
We have to sail together.

20:18.021 --> 20:21.396
That sailor doesn't care whose daughter
you are or who your father is.

20:21.479 --> 20:23.979
He doesn't even know
who Admiral Makarov is.

20:26.937 --> 20:30.396
Okay, I'm going to the shore to my fellows.
I'll be back soon. Lock the door.

20:30.562 --> 20:31.937
Don't let anyone in.

20:45.521 --> 20:46.729
I'll be back soon.

21:18.562 --> 21:22.562
Look, Admiral Makarov died 40 years ago.
He was killed.

21:23.021 --> 21:25.021
He's a hero of Port Arthur.
That's right.

21:25.062 --> 21:27.396
You said she's his daughter.
How old is she?

21:27.729 --> 21:30.021
Did I say? I didn't tell you that.

21:30.312 --> 21:32.687
You've mistaken me for somebody else.

21:33.771 --> 21:35.062
Push. Push.

22:13.062 --> 22:16.812
Stop! Stop! Get away from the car.

22:17.271 --> 22:19.146
Can't you see, can you?

22:19.729 --> 22:23.979
-What do you have there?
-It doesn't matter. Get away.

22:24.562 --> 22:25.687
Put it back.

22:34.979 --> 22:36.646
We're casting off the barge.

22:38.229 --> 22:40.562
We expect to see
the result by morning.

22:42.979 --> 22:44.187
I hope to God.

22:52.104 --> 22:54.771
These bastards fly over lake Ladoga
as if at home.

22:55.729 --> 22:58.812
- We are sailing away in an hour.
- Yes, sir.

22:59.937 --> 23:01.104
Come on, show me.

23:12.562 --> 23:16.479
This is for you. It's the order
to call off the artillery team.

23:17.771 --> 23:21.396
Orderly, assemble the commanders for me.

23:21.437 --> 23:22.479
Yes, sir.

23:28.812 --> 23:32.937
Comrade Company Commander,
Captain 1st rank Gorelov summons you.

23:33.437 --> 23:36.687
Embark them, I'm summoned.
You're on your own.

23:37.229 --> 23:38.437
Gorelov is back.

23:38.521 --> 23:40.021
Don't scatter around the desk.

23:40.062 --> 23:41.812
-Good boy, join the ranks.
-Yes, sir.

23:41.854 --> 23:44.021
Don't run after girls.

23:44.771 --> 23:46.396
Am I understood?

23:46.604 --> 23:47.771
Yes, sir!

23:47.854 --> 23:50.187
Dress! Front!

23:51.896 --> 23:54.687
A division was burned
on that shore yesterday.

23:56.062 --> 23:58.687
About ten people survived.

23:59.521 --> 24:01.896
I'm talking about a new attack.

24:03.312 --> 24:05.979
We need you to provide
a company of cadets.

24:06.479 --> 24:09.104
We're talking about you, Maxim Petrovich.

24:12.812 --> 24:15.521
Withdraw your company from the embarkment.

24:17.396 --> 24:18.396
Will comply.

24:19.271 --> 24:21.604
Is your equipment alright, by the way?

24:21.687 --> 24:24.521
We have rifles, but
there aren't many bullets.

24:26.021 --> 24:28.562
Ten bullets for each artilleryman.

24:28.979 --> 24:30.687
There aren't any machine guns.

24:31.479 --> 24:33.187
That's bad

24:34.771 --> 24:36.771
that there aren't any machine guns.

24:38.979 --> 24:40.729
The artillerymen stay here.

24:40.771 --> 24:43.937
Embark the medics and hydrographers
on the barge.

24:52.104 --> 24:54.771
Artillerymen! Sergeant Bakin!

24:56.437 --> 24:57.604
That's me.

24:58.021 --> 24:59.646
Stop the embarkment.

25:00.812 --> 25:01.896
Will comply!

25:03.854 --> 25:07.229
Artillerymen, halt, one, two.

25:08.562 --> 25:10.229
About face!

25:10.812 --> 25:12.646
Stop the embarkment.

25:12.812 --> 25:14.146
Why stop?

25:14.271 --> 25:16.771
March to the shore, on the double!

25:27.021 --> 25:28.021
Kolya.

25:32.021 --> 25:34.271
-Find my son.
-Will comply.

25:37.104 --> 25:39.104
Come with me, your father
is calling for you.

25:39.146 --> 25:41.646
-Where?
-To Captain 1st rank, Gorelov.

25:41.812 --> 25:43.229
We're forming up.

25:43.771 --> 25:45.437
Captain is calling for him.

25:47.146 --> 25:49.521
Give my watch back, Comrade Sergeant.

25:50.854 --> 25:52.979
I'll give it back when you deserve it.

25:53.104 --> 25:55.396
You must join the ranks in two minutes.

25:56.229 --> 25:57.312
You may go.

25:58.937 --> 26:01.271
We have a combat mission

26:02.146 --> 26:05.604
to do a forced 9-mile forced march
in five minutes.

26:06.437 --> 26:09.937
Check your equipment,
change your footwraps.

26:10.646 --> 26:11.687
Begin.

26:11.812 --> 26:16.104
Put your weapon down! On one, two, three.

26:18.229 --> 26:22.062
Now, civilians,
the first group may proceed.

26:22.687 --> 26:25.604
- Follow me, girls.
- Leave your luggage on the deck.

26:26.271 --> 26:28.812
And go to the hold without your luggage.

26:30.229 --> 26:31.396
Go.

26:41.354 --> 26:44.187
-Why are you so wet?
-I just fell into the water.

26:45.271 --> 26:47.979
Then take off your shirt and put on this.

26:48.854 --> 26:50.521
Father, are you serious?

26:51.354 --> 26:52.521
Yes.

26:53.187 --> 26:55.062
Why? My guys are out there.

26:55.146 --> 26:57.979
Kostya, I know everything
about your guys.

26:58.562 --> 27:01.271
I just made this order.

27:02.271 --> 27:04.687
You will sail on the barge.

27:04.937 --> 27:07.687
Why? Who decided so?

27:08.312 --> 27:10.729
I did. I'm in command here.

27:11.687 --> 27:14.562
And I've decided this for sure.
Get changed.

27:17.062 --> 27:20.646
-What does it mean that you decided?
-It means what I said.

27:20.896 --> 27:23.604
I can't do it. And you can't, dad.

27:23.687 --> 27:25.396
Stop talking, Kostya.

27:26.312 --> 27:29.229
You're not a child and
we aren't in a kindergarten.

27:29.312 --> 27:31.812
Things are really bad
at the front now.

27:31.854 --> 27:33.562
I hope you understand that.

27:35.937 --> 27:37.062
No.

28:03.562 --> 28:04.646
Hello.

28:14.979 --> 28:19.646
Comrade, what am supposed to do with this
devil's piece of wood? Where can I put it?

28:19.729 --> 28:20.937
Why a piece of wood?

28:21.896 --> 28:23.687
This is a grand piano.

28:24.146 --> 28:26.812
You should know that
the very great composer...

28:26.854 --> 28:30.521
I don't care if it was Leo Tolstoy!
It weighs a ton.

28:30.771 --> 28:33.562
And that's about 150 passengers.

28:33.771 --> 28:37.479
Cut the ropes and to hell with it.

28:38.146 --> 28:40.271
Don't you dare cut ropes.

28:40.854 --> 28:44.146
I have an order from the Philharmonic.
Here it is.

28:44.396 --> 28:45.604
Damn it.

28:52.062 --> 28:53.396
-Excuse me.
-What do you want?

28:53.437 --> 28:54.896
I really need to get to the shore.

28:54.937 --> 28:57.021
You won't manage to get back,
we're setting off soon.

28:57.104 --> 28:59.229
-I don't want to go. Please, help me.
-What?

28:59.271 --> 29:00.729
-I don't want to go.
-You don't?

29:00.771 --> 29:01.812
I don't.

29:02.479 --> 29:04.437
-Okay, is this your suitcase?
-It's mine.

29:04.562 --> 29:07.646
Go quickly. Watch out.
Hold on tight.

29:07.687 --> 29:10.146
Mikhail, what are you doing out there?

29:10.396 --> 29:11.479
Make way.

29:11.521 --> 29:15.104
Why risk dealing with uncivilized people.
Your life doesn’t matter to them.

29:16.354 --> 29:17.562
Make way.

29:17.729 --> 29:19.021
Come here.

29:19.729 --> 29:21.187
Liza, don't worry.

29:21.729 --> 29:23.812
Go, I'll take care of it myself.

29:24.396 --> 29:25.646
Make way.

29:26.354 --> 29:28.937
There are 1,500 people,
but the number is inaccurate.

29:29.021 --> 29:30.479
I think there are more.

29:30.854 --> 29:32.312
-Good luck.
-I'll need it.

29:33.354 --> 29:35.354
Make way, make way, make way.

29:39.646 --> 29:40.771
We're going back.

29:40.812 --> 29:44.354
-Why? Why did you get changed?
-I'll explain you later.

29:57.521 --> 29:58.979
The embarkment is over.

29:59.437 --> 30:01.562
Crew, prepare for sailing.

30:03.021 --> 30:05.771
What's happened?
Where's your soldier's uniform?

30:13.021 --> 30:16.396
If you keep silent, I'll get off
this barge right now.

30:17.854 --> 30:21.396
What am I supposed to tell you?
Firstly, nothing bad happened.

30:21.437 --> 30:25.271
For you, nothing has changed at all.
We're sailing together. What do you want?

30:25.312 --> 30:28.729
-Get off me.
-Stop. Let's talk later. I kindly ask you.

30:40.062 --> 30:41.937
Who's smoking? Stop it.

30:42.021 --> 30:45.521
It's smoke from Cadet Babintsev.
His soles are burning.

30:45.562 --> 30:47.229
Comrade Platoon Commander,

30:47.687 --> 30:50.604
I have calluses all over my feet
since I don't have footwraps!

30:50.646 --> 30:52.812
-I can't run anymore!
-Run!

30:53.396 --> 30:57.021
Your legs have become shorter
and your ears have become bigger.

30:57.104 --> 30:59.979
Change your running technique.
Try to use your ears.

31:02.021 --> 31:04.271
Comrade Platoon Commander,
Gorelov is gone.

31:04.729 --> 31:07.437
He went to his father
and hasn't returned to the ranks.

31:07.521 --> 31:10.646
He's a deserter.
You'll report it upon our arrival.

31:10.729 --> 31:12.562
I'll send it to the special department.

31:12.604 --> 31:13.771
Pick up the pace.

31:33.062 --> 31:36.812
I'm sorry lady, but your suitcase has to go
with the other baggage. That's the rule.

31:36.854 --> 31:38.937
-Here it is.
-I'll take it there.

31:41.312 --> 31:42.479
Hello, Nastya.

31:45.146 --> 31:46.604
Don't you recognize me?

31:47.521 --> 31:48.812
I'm an investigator.

31:48.937 --> 31:52.104
I investigated your father's case.
I came to your place on Moika twice.

31:52.146 --> 31:53.521
Don't you remember me?

31:53.812 --> 31:54.937
I remember.

32:01.771 --> 32:03.146
Epistolary genre:

32:04.562 --> 32:07.271
letters, diaries.
Do you have any of them?

32:26.937 --> 32:29.437
Are you here alone or with your mother?

32:29.479 --> 32:30.979
I'm with my boyfriend.

32:32.562 --> 32:34.146
-And where is he?
-Who?

32:35.604 --> 32:37.937
Your boyfriend that you've mentioned.

32:38.812 --> 32:41.229
He's stepped out. Why do you need him?

32:44.896 --> 32:46.646
You wore gloves then, too,

32:46.979 --> 32:48.437
although it was May.

32:57.062 --> 32:58.271
June.

32:58.729 --> 33:00.479
He was arrested in June.

33:01.687 --> 33:04.896
You were frightened of me then and
always stood behind the bookcase.

33:04.937 --> 33:06.896
Do you like people
to be frightened of you?

33:06.937 --> 33:08.229
It's professional.

33:11.521 --> 33:16.771
I'm accustomed to the fact that my clients
don't like me, to put it mildly.

33:20.187 --> 33:22.187
Have you settled somewhere over here?

33:22.229 --> 33:23.604
In the hold.

33:27.729 --> 33:30.521
I can offer
a more comfortable room to you.

33:31.354 --> 33:33.062
Inside the car.

33:33.979 --> 33:35.562
I was looking for you.

33:36.479 --> 33:39.021
Meet Captain Petruchik,
the NKVD investigator

33:39.104 --> 33:41.146
who investigated my dad's case.

33:42.187 --> 33:46.604
And this is Kostya Gorelov,
Captain Gorelov's son.

33:48.021 --> 33:49.896
Vadim Petruchik.

33:53.479 --> 33:54.729
Cadet Gorelov.

33:57.812 --> 34:01.729
So, guys, we're going
to travel together, right?

34:07.812 --> 34:09.271
By the way,

34:09.729 --> 34:11.479
where is your senior officer?

34:11.729 --> 34:13.354
What was his name?

34:17.937 --> 34:19.812
Okay, I'll go find him myself.

34:24.312 --> 34:26.937
This man has figured everything out
about you.

34:49.271 --> 34:51.937
There are reports saying
that in the next few hours,

34:51.979 --> 34:55.812
the Russian air force will make
another attempt to land.

34:56.312 --> 34:59.354
They need the left shore and a channel.

35:00.229 --> 35:02.979
But most of all,
I'm interested in Lake Ladoga.

35:03.021 --> 35:04.937
What barge do the Russians have there?

35:04.979 --> 35:06.896
There can't be any.

35:06.979 --> 35:10.479
No barge, no boat, not even
a floating piece of wood.

35:10.771 --> 35:12.687
Everything must be destroyed.

36:05.229 --> 36:07.062
-Let's get out of here?
-To where?

36:07.354 --> 36:09.437
Does it matter? Down there.

36:12.812 --> 36:14.312
Why did you chicken out?

36:14.521 --> 36:17.771
I didn't chicken out. Believe me,
there was a reason.

36:19.229 --> 36:20.312
That's a long story.

36:20.354 --> 36:23.229
-What was it? Tell me.
-I wanted to be with you.

36:25.021 --> 36:26.229
Is it weird?

36:26.312 --> 36:28.687
So, it's my fault that
you chickened out, right?

36:28.729 --> 36:31.896
It's such an honor to be a girl
whose boyfriend deserted the army for her.

36:31.937 --> 36:32.896
I'm honored.

36:36.771 --> 36:38.479
Don't look for me anymore.

36:51.937 --> 36:52.896
There

36:54.979 --> 36:58.687
on that shore, you're not there.
But the enemy is. Understand?

36:59.979 --> 37:01.104
Our task

37:02.562 --> 37:05.271
is to land on that shore and dig in.

37:06.604 --> 37:08.729
Leningrad needs a channel.

37:09.396 --> 37:12.021
That's why the enemy should be flung back.

37:12.271 --> 37:13.479
That's an order.

37:15.646 --> 37:16.979
We're Russian people.

37:18.687 --> 37:20.271
We're on our own land.

37:20.937 --> 37:22.687
We can't be frightened.

37:24.062 --> 37:25.979
Yesterday, we left that shore.

37:27.521 --> 37:28.812
Today, we must

37:29.646 --> 37:32.687
get back there with your help, warriors.

37:33.937 --> 37:36.229
We should accomplish the task

37:37.354 --> 37:38.437
or die.

37:41.396 --> 37:44.271
Maria Nikolaevna, we've received
the reports; should we publish them?

37:44.312 --> 37:45.354
Of course, Zoya.

37:45.646 --> 37:49.062
Hello. Have you settled in? How are you?

37:49.437 --> 37:51.771
I'm okay. Thank you very much.

37:51.854 --> 37:54.729
As we suffered from the bombing
and were left without a home,

37:54.771 --> 37:56.396
they put us in line for evacuation.

37:56.437 --> 37:58.604
-I see. How is your cat?
-It's getting used to it.

37:58.646 --> 38:00.604
It's a wonder that it survived.

38:00.687 --> 38:02.729
It's a war. There are many wonders.

38:03.104 --> 38:05.771
-My husband was released from prison.
-Are you serious?

38:05.812 --> 38:06.812
Hello.

38:07.104 --> 38:10.104
They sent him to the front at once.
I don't know if that's good or bad.

38:10.146 --> 38:11.729
That's good, of course.

38:16.146 --> 38:18.021
-Hello.
-Good afternoon.

38:25.521 --> 38:27.187
Don't shit yourself, Andrey.

38:27.437 --> 38:29.396
We should sell our lives dearly.

38:30.979 --> 38:33.354
Here, take my watch. That's a present.

38:34.021 --> 38:37.646
Take it and stick with me.
I won't abandon you on the battlefield.

38:37.687 --> 38:39.229
Will comply, Comrade Sergeant!

38:39.271 --> 38:41.271
-I mean you, too.
-Will comply.

38:41.312 --> 38:42.812
We should stick together

38:43.854 --> 38:45.437
at a 15-foot distance.

38:46.229 --> 38:49.021
Our goal is to safely get
to the nearest cover.

38:49.646 --> 38:51.854
-Am I understood?
-Yes, sir.

38:59.729 --> 39:00.729
Come on!

39:03.604 --> 39:04.604
Quickly!

39:08.437 --> 39:09.896
Keep low!

39:11.979 --> 39:13.437
- Follow me!
- Forward!

39:13.854 --> 39:14.896
Don't stop!

39:15.604 --> 39:17.187
- Where are you going?
- Go forward!

39:30.896 --> 39:32.437
Follow me!

39:58.979 --> 39:59.979
Forward!

40:17.562 --> 40:19.271
Don't cry, Andrey.

40:19.312 --> 40:22.479
I'm not crying.
I have calluses all over my feet.

40:27.896 --> 40:30.146
You've found a good position,
you sons of bitches.

40:30.396 --> 40:31.854
We can't even approach.

40:42.687 --> 40:43.937
Bullets.

40:47.187 --> 40:49.146
Give me hand.

41:00.979 --> 41:02.104
Take them.

41:17.062 --> 41:18.687
I see I've made you run.

41:28.271 --> 41:30.896
We're leaving. Leave.

41:31.854 --> 41:35.354
They're attacking us.
I told you to get out of here.

41:35.437 --> 41:37.521
Stand up, go, go.

41:51.937 --> 41:55.646
Please, get me out of here.

41:55.937 --> 41:58.979
I don't want to die. Please, help me.

42:03.562 --> 42:06.646
Please, get me out of here.

42:06.812 --> 42:08.979
Wait. Wait.

42:09.104 --> 42:11.354
Wait a bit, wait, I'll...

42:17.979 --> 42:20.729
I'll get you out of there.
Shush!

42:54.521 --> 42:56.521
Stand up. Andrey, stand up.

42:56.937 --> 43:00.021
We should go another 30 feet
and they won't be able to hurt us.

43:00.062 --> 43:01.562
Andrey, stand up.

43:27.646 --> 43:29.604
-Comrade Sergeant.
-Andrey.

43:30.021 --> 43:32.812
-This is hell!
-Get up!

43:33.104 --> 43:34.437
It's dangerous here.

43:44.146 --> 43:45.562
Listen to me, comrades.

43:45.854 --> 43:48.437
The ladies' bathroom is on the deck.

43:48.812 --> 43:52.312
Men can relieve themselves off the deck,
you know that.

43:53.562 --> 43:56.854
-Where are you going? Are you alone?
-I'm alone.

43:57.562 --> 44:00.146
Your hold is there with the soldiers.
Go round there.

44:00.229 --> 44:03.354
Only civilians and officers
with their families can stay here.

44:03.396 --> 44:05.062
-Go. Go.
-Okay, I got it.

44:07.396 --> 44:09.646
Drinking water is here.

44:20.479 --> 44:22.229
Break into two column.

44:24.771 --> 44:26.354
Into two column.

44:26.771 --> 44:28.354
Let's go, let's go.

44:30.771 --> 44:31.896
Let's go, let's go.

44:56.021 --> 44:58.104
Pomerantseva? Follow me.

44:59.854 --> 45:00.854
Stand here.

45:02.229 --> 45:03.229
What?

45:03.521 --> 45:04.812
What's your problem?

45:04.896 --> 45:08.687
I don't have any problem, but
this girl is going to have one.

45:08.937 --> 45:10.854
-Because of me?
-No, don't worry.

45:10.896 --> 45:14.479
I don't have anything to do with it.
Excuse me. Come here.

45:15.646 --> 45:17.271
What do you think you're doing?

45:18.979 --> 45:20.729
No, darling. Please, explain yourself.

45:20.771 --> 45:23.771
Have you finished school?
You have to study for one more year.

45:23.812 --> 45:24.979
You're a student.

45:25.646 --> 45:28.062
It's prohibited to stay on the deck.

45:29.312 --> 45:33.312
Don't push each other and proceed
to the hold in an orderly way.

45:37.062 --> 45:39.437
Congratulations. Your husband is back.

45:40.021 --> 45:41.854
-Back?
-Yes.

45:41.979 --> 45:44.687
I saw him walking and
didn't recognize him right away.

45:44.771 --> 45:46.187
Thank you.

45:48.354 --> 45:49.437
Sasha.

45:57.646 --> 45:58.771
Sasha.

46:16.187 --> 46:18.854
It was in the morning.
He said hello to me.

46:19.396 --> 46:21.062
I couldn't mistake him.

46:23.479 --> 46:24.562
Thank you.

46:28.354 --> 46:29.479
Thank you.

46:56.354 --> 46:58.187
Hold on. Hold on.

46:58.687 --> 47:00.146
Hang in there.

47:04.854 --> 47:05.854
Forward!

47:06.937 --> 47:07.937
Lie down!

47:18.854 --> 47:19.937
Who are you?

47:21.146 --> 47:22.812
I have a Ph.D. in biology.

47:27.479 --> 47:29.104
So, you're Dr. Doolittle.

47:38.437 --> 47:40.479
Comrade Sergeant,

47:40.896 --> 47:45.354
those sons of bitches have a machine gun
on the right side. We can't break out.

47:45.396 --> 47:48.979
Take our soldiers and storm the hill.
You have ten minutes.

47:49.062 --> 47:52.229
Do you understand what I said?
Perform the task.

47:55.312 --> 47:56.479
Yes, sir!

47:59.271 --> 48:01.479
Andrey, take off your boots.

48:03.187 --> 48:05.187
You'll have to run fast.

48:28.687 --> 48:29.687
I'm ready.

48:31.771 --> 48:32.937
Let's go.

48:46.437 --> 48:48.271
Break into platoons.

48:49.021 --> 48:51.312
-I'll point him out.
-Has he done anything already?

48:51.354 --> 48:53.979
No, I just want to know this cadet's name.

48:56.104 --> 48:57.271
Attention.

48:57.937 --> 49:01.646
When I call your surname, come
front and center, then go into the hold.

49:01.729 --> 49:03.396
-Tikhomirov.
-That's me.

49:04.396 --> 49:06.604
-Miklashevich.
-That's me.

49:07.521 --> 49:09.104
-Andreev.
-That's me.

49:09.979 --> 49:12.271
-Borisenko.
-That's me.

49:13.812 --> 49:15.604
-Rotov.
-That's me.

49:16.437 --> 49:18.146
-Bogdanov.
-That's me.

49:20.396 --> 49:21.437
Volkov.

49:39.854 --> 49:42.354
Stop. I told you not to go ahead.

49:42.854 --> 49:44.562
I can stab you in the ass with a bayonet.

49:49.562 --> 49:51.146
We should devide into two units.

49:52.021 --> 49:53.604
Three of you, follow me.

49:54.146 --> 49:55.771
The others stay here.

50:04.229 --> 50:05.479
Where are you going?

50:06.062 --> 50:07.062
Wait here for a command.

51:06.854 --> 51:09.146
- Follow me!
- I am trying.

52:29.354 --> 52:30.354
Thank you.

53:02.979 --> 53:05.479
I'll shove this watch into your throat,

53:06.937 --> 53:08.437
captain's son.

53:20.771 --> 53:22.562
-Scherbinin.
-That's me.

53:26.521 --> 53:28.562
What's your surname, cadet?

53:28.979 --> 53:30.812
You are not in the list.

53:31.604 --> 53:33.354
- What's your surname?
- I'll deal with it.

53:52.146 --> 53:54.937
Hold on, son.

53:55.437 --> 53:58.896
Hold on. Hold on.

54:05.312 --> 54:06.354
Sergeant.

54:06.687 --> 54:09.729
Take two of your soldiers
and take away the injured.

54:10.271 --> 54:13.312
There must be some reinforcements.

54:14.479 --> 54:16.979
It's shallow there. They won't come close.

54:17.062 --> 54:19.646
Load up and go to Novaya Ladoga.

54:20.229 --> 54:21.604
And you?

54:21.687 --> 54:26.104
The artillery will cover us.
And there'll be reinforcements.

54:26.437 --> 54:30.396
We've driven them back from the shore.
Now it'll become easier.

54:31.979 --> 54:33.354
I leave this with you.

54:34.396 --> 54:35.562
Thank you.

54:40.896 --> 54:44.521
Take away the injured, Dr. Doolittle.

54:47.062 --> 54:48.771
We are leaving.

54:51.062 --> 54:53.479
How come you mistook your uniform, cadet?

55:00.187 --> 55:03.437
Why didn't you go ashore when
they commanded to enrank?

55:05.104 --> 55:06.646
I didn't hear the command.

55:07.979 --> 55:10.812
I heard it, everyone heard it,
but you didn't.

55:13.479 --> 55:15.812
I didn't hear it because
I was in the hold.

55:16.729 --> 55:18.396
Do you have any witnesses?

55:19.562 --> 55:20.937
I have no witnesses.

55:30.354 --> 55:32.521
You're covering up for your girl.

55:33.812 --> 55:35.646
Was it her who led you astray?

55:36.937 --> 55:38.604
She didn’t lead me astray.

55:41.271 --> 55:46.187
Do you know that her father is an enemy
of the people, a traitor, a German spy?

55:46.937 --> 55:48.396
Didn't you know that?

55:49.896 --> 55:51.896
How long have you been together?

55:53.229 --> 55:54.646
About a month.

55:57.271 --> 55:59.062
Look, cadet.

55:59.521 --> 56:02.146
There are three volumes of evidence

56:03.187 --> 56:06.146
and the confession written
by this girl's father in my car.

56:06.187 --> 56:09.271
He confessed that he did
subversive work in Leningrad.

56:09.937 --> 56:12.896
He's also responsible for the fact
that we're retreating

56:12.937 --> 56:14.604
and suffering casualties now.

56:15.729 --> 56:18.437
I could lend it to you.
Do you want to read it?

56:20.854 --> 56:22.312
No, I don't want to.

56:25.854 --> 56:28.021
Stand at attention, cadet!

56:30.729 --> 56:35.187
And don't talk rudely to me,
or I'll whack you like a dog

56:35.646 --> 56:38.437
and throw you overboard,
no trial, no record.

56:44.021 --> 56:45.146
Am I clear?

56:46.979 --> 56:47.979
Clear.

56:51.854 --> 56:55.562
So, Captain 1st rank
Gorelov is your father?

56:59.187 --> 57:01.354
My father has nothing to do with it.

57:02.979 --> 57:05.271
You say he has nothing to do with it.

57:07.854 --> 57:10.396
I'll bring you to the special department

57:10.729 --> 57:12.354
tomorrow in Novaya Ladoga.

57:13.229 --> 57:16.312
They will figure out what
to do with you in no time.

57:17.437 --> 57:18.646
With both of you.

57:19.312 --> 57:21.062
Your father won't help you.

57:22.562 --> 57:23.896
You can forget it.

57:24.729 --> 57:26.021
May I go?

57:32.687 --> 57:33.729
No.

57:52.854 --> 57:54.771
Hold on. We'll be there soon.

58:07.146 --> 58:08.521
Dr. Doolittle,

58:09.562 --> 58:11.271
we're leaving.

58:13.896 --> 58:15.187
Do you hear me?

58:15.937 --> 58:16.979
We're leaving.

58:18.479 --> 58:20.479
I'm staying.

58:50.062 --> 58:53.146
The barge must be somewhere
over here at the moment.

58:53.687 --> 58:55.854
They've covered most of the distance.

58:56.979 --> 59:00.521
I received a message from the captain
of the tugboat just a moment ago.

59:00.687 --> 59:02.771
Should make it by dawn.

59:03.062 --> 59:06.896
As soon as they report their arrival,
we'll start preparing the next vessel.

59:06.937 --> 59:08.104
All right.

59:11.062 --> 59:14.187
Meteorological observers say
there'll be waves in that very sector,

59:14.271 --> 59:16.646
low cloud cover, and a squally wind.

59:20.854 --> 59:22.187
It'll be a force-nine gale.

59:23.562 --> 59:25.187
You say your son's there?

59:26.229 --> 59:27.312
Yes, sir.

59:29.021 --> 59:32.104
In poor weather conditions, the enemy
won't be able to use its air power.

59:32.146 --> 59:33.354
That's a good thing.

59:34.271 --> 59:35.562
Go back to the berth.

59:36.729 --> 59:39.396
We'll hope that
everything will be alright.

1:01:31.979 --> 1:01:33.396
Stand up!

1:01:33.854 --> 1:01:35.396
There's a storm.

1:01:35.479 --> 1:01:38.021
-Where's Tusik?
-I don't know. I haven't seen anything.

1:01:38.062 --> 1:01:39.687
Tusik. Tusik. Where's Tusik?

1:01:39.896 --> 1:01:42.896
- Where's my dog?
- Whose dog is it?

1:01:43.062 --> 1:01:44.646
-It's ours.
-It's mine.

1:01:44.812 --> 1:01:45.896
It's ours.

1:01:49.146 --> 1:01:52.187
Pomerantseva, is this
how you use the bathroom?

1:01:53.354 --> 1:01:54.354
Get out of here.

1:01:54.437 --> 1:01:55.479
She's crazy.

1:01:56.479 --> 1:01:57.937
Why is she not asleep?

1:01:58.812 --> 1:02:00.271
You're expelled.

1:02:00.562 --> 1:02:03.021
You're not a student
of our class anymore.

1:02:03.104 --> 1:02:04.604
Step away from the car.

1:02:04.687 --> 1:02:06.271
I tell you to stand back.

1:02:10.021 --> 1:02:12.312
-I think I'd better go.
-It's early.

1:02:14.021 --> 1:02:15.437
I'll talk to her.

1:02:17.104 --> 1:02:19.687
Go to the hold, lady.

1:02:20.979 --> 1:02:22.479
It's dangerous out here.

1:02:33.104 --> 1:02:35.021
Comrades, don't panic.

1:02:35.521 --> 1:02:37.146
Stay where you are!

1:02:39.104 --> 1:02:41.729
I need to cover the instrument.

1:02:47.146 --> 1:02:48.896
Go to the hold, I tell you.

1:02:49.021 --> 1:02:51.729
Galina Sergeevna, go to the hold.
I'm okay.

1:02:52.937 --> 1:02:55.479
I said, go to the hold! Get out!

1:02:57.979 --> 1:02:59.896
I'd better go. She's crazy.

1:03:24.271 --> 1:03:25.812
Untie me.

1:03:35.187 --> 1:03:36.729
Untie me.

1:03:56.646 --> 1:03:58.687
-Who was swept overboard?
-I don't know.

1:03:58.729 --> 1:04:00.437
-A civilian?
-I don't know.

1:04:01.104 --> 1:04:02.562
Who was swept overboard?

1:04:02.604 --> 1:04:04.771
Please, tell me, who was it?

1:04:04.812 --> 1:04:06.479
Girl, where are you going?

1:04:27.771 --> 1:04:28.771
Hold onto me!

1:04:30.729 --> 1:04:31.729
Quickly!

1:04:48.104 --> 1:04:52.229
There's a breach one on the port side.

1:04:52.479 --> 1:04:53.854
Give me the support.

1:04:57.104 --> 1:04:58.229
Nastya.

1:04:58.437 --> 1:05:00.312
Don't even try to...

1:05:01.354 --> 1:05:02.896
Get down.

1:05:12.604 --> 1:05:13.687
Nastya!

1:05:35.354 --> 1:05:37.646
There's a lot of water in the hold.

1:05:37.979 --> 1:05:39.437
The people are panicking.

1:05:39.771 --> 1:05:41.271
What should I tell them?

1:05:42.396 --> 1:05:47.771
Tell them that we won't change the route.
They should pump out the water.

1:05:47.812 --> 1:05:49.187
Got it.

1:06:01.479 --> 1:06:02.604
Stay.

1:06:03.437 --> 1:06:05.479
Come with me and help me!

1:06:09.521 --> 1:06:10.521
Hold it.

1:06:11.229 --> 1:06:13.437
Pull it there! Into the hold.

1:06:13.979 --> 1:06:16.479
Put it there. Slowly. Hold it. Help him.

1:06:16.687 --> 1:06:18.604
I'll go call someone to help.

1:06:20.854 --> 1:06:22.479
- Nastya!
- Make way.

1:06:23.896 --> 1:06:26.396
Officer, we need ten people
to help us up there.

1:06:26.812 --> 1:06:28.562
Guys, ten people go up, quickly.

1:06:29.521 --> 1:06:32.604
Guys, do it, quickly. Five. Six. Seven...

1:06:33.937 --> 1:06:34.937
Nastya!

1:06:35.687 --> 1:06:37.437
- Quickly!
- The others should stay here.

1:06:43.896 --> 1:06:45.062
Hold on!

1:06:46.854 --> 1:06:48.646
Pump.

1:06:48.979 --> 1:06:52.437
Pump it, guys. One. Two.

1:06:55.562 --> 1:06:58.729
The barge has gained weight.
We won't pull it out.

1:07:00.104 --> 1:07:01.812
- Send a SOS, Sasha.
- Yes, sir.

1:07:04.687 --> 1:07:08.687
Damn you!

1:07:09.437 --> 1:07:11.396
Attention, all vessels!

1:07:11.562 --> 1:07:14.479
There's a vessel in distress
in the sixth sector.

1:07:14.562 --> 1:07:16.229
Barge 752. It's carrying people.

1:07:16.271 --> 1:07:17.437
1,500 people.

1:07:17.854 --> 1:07:21.062
Nobody will risk going to this sector
in such a storm.

1:07:22.104 --> 1:07:23.812
There's nobody to save them.

1:07:28.687 --> 1:07:31.104
The barge will be here in an hour.

1:07:31.729 --> 1:07:34.271
According to our data, there's no cover.

1:07:34.312 --> 1:07:38.229
You'll have to get up early, Hans,
and meet that barge.

1:07:38.854 --> 1:07:41.312
The field marshal is celebrating
his birthday tomorrow.

1:07:41.396 --> 1:07:44.312
Make a present to him.
Take off before breakfast.

1:07:44.687 --> 1:07:48.437
When you come back, I'll personally
feed you and allow you to sleep.

1:07:48.562 --> 1:07:52.854
Everything will be alright, general.
The field marshal is going to like it.

1:07:53.646 --> 1:07:57.646
Remember that the fuel is enough
only for one-way trip.

1:08:01.021 --> 1:08:02.104
He's crazy.

1:08:21.937 --> 1:08:26.354
I'm happy that our child,
our girl, will go to school.

1:08:27.812 --> 1:08:32.312
I want to come back from the Tian Shan
and be with you on that day.

1:08:33.604 --> 1:08:38.896
Surprisingly, you always imagine such
important events in a somewhat banal way,

1:08:38.937 --> 1:08:40.896
as if it's nothing special.

1:08:41.937 --> 1:08:47.312
Darling, true happiness doesn't require
any frills or exaggerations.

1:10:27.521 --> 1:10:29.271
What's this?

1:10:35.021 --> 1:10:38.479
Comrades, don't panic.

1:10:58.354 --> 1:10:59.604
Quickly, quickly.

1:11:00.271 --> 1:11:01.396
Air attack!

1:11:03.021 --> 1:11:04.437
We'll die.

1:11:04.687 --> 1:11:06.812
We'll die here.

1:11:08.604 --> 1:11:09.771
Shut the hell up.

1:11:10.271 --> 1:11:12.854
Don't panic. We should get out of here.

1:11:13.437 --> 1:11:14.979
Give me a rifle.

1:11:15.229 --> 1:11:16.312
Who has got a rifle?

1:11:16.937 --> 1:11:17.937
Give me a rifle! Quickly!

1:11:18.562 --> 1:11:19.604
Now.

1:11:20.271 --> 1:11:21.937
- Pass it here!
- And bullets.

1:11:23.146 --> 1:11:24.646
Do you have more rifles?

1:11:25.771 --> 1:11:27.812
-Kostya.
-Nastya?

1:11:29.271 --> 1:11:31.687
Where are you?

1:11:47.979 --> 1:11:50.646
There aren't many bullets.
Here's what I've got.

1:12:00.062 --> 1:12:01.062
Fire!

1:12:31.604 --> 1:12:32.771
Load!

1:12:48.896 --> 1:12:49.896
Fire!

1:13:04.104 --> 1:13:05.229
Commander.

1:13:06.146 --> 1:13:08.854
-Repeat.
-I've got a problem.

1:13:08.896 --> 1:13:11.854
-We need to leave.
-Leave for base.

1:13:13.396 --> 1:13:15.896
The field marshal won't get his present.

1:13:57.187 --> 1:13:59.979
-Lieutenant, whose car is that?
-What does it matter?

1:14:00.021 --> 1:14:01.729
We have to push it into the water.

1:14:01.771 --> 1:14:04.729
I won't assume this responsibility.
I don't want to be court-martialed.

1:14:04.854 --> 1:14:06.729
I see. Neither do I.

1:14:06.854 --> 1:14:07.937
Whose car it this.

1:14:08.021 --> 1:14:10.312
This is a car
of the Estonian government.

1:14:10.396 --> 1:14:12.646
There are documents and archives in it.
What's up?

1:14:12.687 --> 1:14:14.771
-Who escorts it?
-I do.

1:14:15.562 --> 1:14:17.062
I'm an NKVD captain.

1:14:18.312 --> 1:14:19.646
Got it.

1:14:21.896 --> 1:14:24.062
Captain, there are people down there.

1:14:24.437 --> 1:14:25.896
The barge is sinking.

1:14:26.187 --> 1:14:28.396
There's much water in the hold.
It's filling up.

1:14:28.437 --> 1:14:30.562
It looks like all of us will end up badly.

1:14:30.604 --> 1:14:33.312
We need to unload the barge
and remove at least something.

1:14:33.354 --> 1:14:35.354
Then we'll have a chance to pull through.

1:14:35.396 --> 1:14:38.062
I think it's better for you and me
to leave the Estonians

1:14:38.104 --> 1:14:41.229
without their archive than to kill people
and be court-martialed.

1:14:41.271 --> 1:14:43.271
-Bring them here.
-Will comply.

1:14:43.771 --> 1:14:45.521
I won't grant my permission.

1:14:45.687 --> 1:14:48.396
I'm a skipper.
I'm the captain of this barge.

1:14:48.604 --> 1:14:50.312
The tugboat has sent a SOS.

1:14:50.896 --> 1:14:52.354
We are all in distress.

1:14:52.396 --> 1:14:54.979
According to all of the rules,
I'm in charge here,

1:14:55.021 --> 1:14:57.104
irrespective of ranks and titles, captain.

1:14:57.354 --> 1:14:58.187
Do it.

1:14:58.271 --> 1:15:00.562
Five cadets, come up to me quickly.

1:15:00.687 --> 1:15:02.062
Stop.

1:15:02.146 --> 1:15:05.312
-Come out, lady. Go to the pilot house.
-I'm sorry, I...

1:15:06.021 --> 1:15:09.396
I'm telling you that I don't permit it.

1:15:09.604 --> 1:15:11.937
I couldn't care less
about what you said!

1:15:11.979 --> 1:15:13.396
-Let me help you.
-Okay.

1:15:15.646 --> 1:15:19.396
Step away from the car!
Step away from the car, I'm telling you!

1:15:20.604 --> 1:15:23.646
Guys, stop listening to that shit.
We have to save people...

1:15:23.771 --> 1:15:24.854
Stop!

1:15:24.896 --> 1:15:25.771
...children!

1:15:25.854 --> 1:15:27.104
Wait, there's...

1:15:27.396 --> 1:15:28.937
My girl's there.

1:15:29.021 --> 1:15:30.229
Step away from the car.

1:15:30.312 --> 1:15:32.687
-Get out.
-I don't want to take a sin upon my soul.

1:15:32.729 --> 1:15:34.271
Push it, guys.

1:15:34.937 --> 1:15:36.854
Look, he's a diversionist.

1:15:37.521 --> 1:15:40.312
He's a traitor.
And his father is a Captain 1st rank.

1:15:40.354 --> 1:15:43.562
It was him who gave us this decayed barge.

1:15:44.146 --> 1:15:45.937
He's a traitor and enemy of the people.

1:15:45.979 --> 1:15:47.146
Shut up.

1:15:47.271 --> 1:15:49.812
-What did you say?
-I said, shut up, Comrade Sergeant.

1:15:49.854 --> 1:15:51.521
-What did you say?
-I said, shut up.

1:15:51.604 --> 1:15:54.812
I have evidence and it's not your
fate that's being determined now.

1:15:54.854 --> 1:15:57.562
-Put the gun down.
-Shoot me. Shoot me.

1:15:57.604 --> 1:15:59.687
Wait, comrades.

1:16:02.354 --> 1:16:03.562
Follow me.

1:16:04.021 --> 1:16:05.021
Let's go.

1:16:06.646 --> 1:16:08.229
Let's kick off the piano.

1:16:19.354 --> 1:16:20.354
Wait.

1:16:28.312 --> 1:16:32.104
Be careful, comrades.
One of the casters falters.

1:16:33.021 --> 1:16:34.937
One, two, lift!

1:16:38.229 --> 1:16:39.562
Push, guys.

1:16:40.729 --> 1:16:42.146
Be careful, comrades.

1:16:46.271 --> 1:16:47.354
I told you.

1:16:47.604 --> 1:16:48.646
It falters.

1:16:49.146 --> 1:16:51.271
-It doesn't want to die.
-Who wants to?

1:16:56.396 --> 1:16:58.521
Turn it. Let's turn it on its side.

1:16:59.271 --> 1:17:00.312
One.

1:17:01.479 --> 1:17:03.229
No. Two.

1:17:11.729 --> 1:17:13.062
Do whatever you want.

1:17:14.146 --> 1:17:17.354
Sailor, tell them down there to bring
women and children to the pilot house.

1:17:17.396 --> 1:17:19.521
Make sure that it's
women and children only.

1:17:19.562 --> 1:17:20.812
-Nastya.
-I'm here.

1:17:20.854 --> 1:17:25.312
Throw everything you see on the deck
into the water: sacks, kegs, suitcases.

1:17:25.687 --> 1:17:27.687
Throw everything into the water.

1:17:32.021 --> 1:17:34.771
Commander, I won't make it.

1:17:36.187 --> 1:17:40.229
Walter, don't panic. Everything is okay.

1:17:42.062 --> 1:17:44.229
Everything will be okay, Walter.

1:17:44.896 --> 1:17:47.062
No, it won't maintain altitude.

1:17:54.021 --> 1:17:55.396
I have to go back.

1:18:04.521 --> 1:18:07.271
Sasha, what's up there?

1:18:08.896 --> 1:18:11.062
They've destroyed half of the engine.

1:18:11.104 --> 1:18:12.562
What's up on the barge?

1:18:22.646 --> 1:18:25.146
They're getting people out of the hold.

1:18:25.854 --> 1:18:27.354
Lower the dinghy, Sasha.

1:18:28.104 --> 1:18:31.146
-We need to bring them here.
-I'll do it, captain.

1:18:32.312 --> 1:18:33.312
Be careful.

1:18:33.521 --> 1:18:34.604
Go ahead.

1:18:35.687 --> 1:18:37.146
Mitya, give me Tusik.

1:18:38.812 --> 1:18:39.812
Come here.

1:18:41.562 --> 1:18:43.062
You can't take your dog.

1:18:43.604 --> 1:18:45.229
- Why not?
- That's a rule.

1:18:45.771 --> 1:18:47.312
Mitya, I am staying.

1:18:49.396 --> 1:18:50.562
Give me your hand.

1:18:52.979 --> 1:18:55.521
- I am staying with you.
- Calm down.

1:18:56.479 --> 1:18:59.146
Children go first. Girls, go up there.

1:18:59.521 --> 1:19:00.604
Another group.

1:19:02.271 --> 1:19:04.896
Only women and children can be here.

1:19:06.271 --> 1:19:07.521
Go up there.

1:19:08.604 --> 1:19:09.729
One by one.

1:19:19.312 --> 1:19:21.271
I don't think this will help you.

1:19:22.062 --> 1:19:23.187
Push it.

1:19:23.896 --> 1:19:26.771
Makarov, there's no more room.

1:19:29.396 --> 1:19:31.729
Please, wait.
My girlfriend is in the hold.

1:19:31.771 --> 1:19:33.354
She's slim, she'll squeeze in.

1:19:33.437 --> 1:19:35.771
No more room. Go help push the car.

1:19:36.521 --> 1:19:37.812
Push it. Push it.

1:19:38.646 --> 1:19:39.771
Nastya.

1:19:39.854 --> 1:19:41.771
Squeeze in, I beg you.

1:19:51.729 --> 1:19:53.229
Do you feel well?

1:19:53.562 --> 1:19:55.687
I'm okay. Don't worry.

1:19:58.271 --> 1:20:00.396
Did grandpa stay
on the deck the whole time?

1:20:00.979 --> 1:20:03.104
Yes, he did.

1:20:04.187 --> 1:20:07.812
He was a true hero.
Everyone who survived said so.

1:20:09.604 --> 1:20:12.521
And on the deck, which I never got to,

1:20:13.521 --> 1:20:16.271
the most terrible things
happened afterward.

1:22:22.312 --> 1:22:23.812
-Comrade Sergeant.
-What?

1:22:23.979 --> 1:22:26.187
-Do you know him?
-Yes.

1:22:27.521 --> 1:22:29.896
This guy is from our company.

1:22:36.396 --> 1:22:38.146
Move on, soldiers.

1:22:40.854 --> 1:22:43.062
Nastya! Nastya!

1:22:44.896 --> 1:22:45.937
Nastya!

1:22:52.937 --> 1:22:54.187
Nastya!

1:23:06.979 --> 1:23:07.979
Swim here.

1:23:11.979 --> 1:23:12.979
Hold on, guys.

1:23:16.229 --> 1:23:17.687
Pull them on the deck.

1:23:18.187 --> 1:23:19.187
Easy, easy.

1:23:34.021 --> 1:23:35.646
Put him here. Carefully.

1:23:49.104 --> 1:23:50.312
We're here.

1:23:57.312 --> 1:23:59.687
Come on! Pull them!
Give your hand.

1:24:08.104 --> 1:24:09.104
Come on.

1:24:25.937 --> 1:24:29.354
Have you come back to return
my watch, Comrade Sergeant?

1:24:30.562 --> 1:24:31.729
Exactly.

1:25:07.562 --> 1:25:08.604
My God.

1:25:09.271 --> 1:25:11.729
Our daughter has grown up so quickly.

1:25:12.646 --> 1:25:16.354
I haven't noticed because
I'm always away on a mission.

1:25:17.479 --> 1:25:20.521
What a beautiful life she'll have!

1:25:21.812 --> 1:25:25.646
But there's some insecurity in the world,
sometimes even much insecurity.

1:25:25.729 --> 1:25:29.354
May God keep our child
away from the war.

1:25:35.896 --> 1:25:39.104
Hello, Zoya. What about the reports?
Have we received them?

1:25:39.271 --> 1:25:40.354
Yes.

1:25:51.104 --> 1:25:54.062
The Germans have already reached
Pushkin and Petrodvorets.

1:25:54.146 --> 1:25:56.104
My God, what will happen to us?

1:25:57.479 --> 1:25:58.521
Anything else?

1:25:59.021 --> 1:26:02.187
The Germans are said to have bombed
Lake Ladoga all night long.

1:26:02.229 --> 1:26:04.354
They sank several of our barges.

1:26:05.312 --> 1:26:08.229
But there isn't a word
about it in the reports.

1:26:08.604 --> 1:26:09.646
I understand.

1:26:11.229 --> 1:26:13.271
Thank God that there isn't a word.

1:26:14.021 --> 1:26:16.521
You and I work for the editor's office.

1:26:17.146 --> 1:26:19.146
We should trust official statements,

1:26:19.312 --> 1:26:20.521
but not rumors.

1:26:22.771 --> 1:26:23.896
Get to work.

1:27:09.062 --> 1:27:10.354
Here's the order.

1:27:11.104 --> 1:27:13.604
This is the transcript. You can read it.

1:27:13.979 --> 1:27:18.979
It seems that they are convincing me that
barge 752 is unsuitable to carry people.

1:27:19.396 --> 1:27:22.271
That's likely to be true,
and there's a risk.

1:27:23.146 --> 1:27:27.396
But if the barge doesn't sail,
I'll be shot tomorrow. That's it.

1:27:28.229 --> 1:27:30.937
I have no other options
to transport people.

1:27:31.646 --> 1:27:34.271
The passenger fleet has
no access to Lake Ladoga anymore.

1:27:34.354 --> 1:27:36.812
It can't get there, but
we need to evacuate people.

1:27:36.854 --> 1:27:40.062
I insisted that the barge
be loaded up to the brim.

1:27:40.104 --> 1:27:42.562
I said that my son will sail on it.

1:27:44.146 --> 1:27:45.937
My words are recorded here.

1:27:46.687 --> 1:27:48.562
I can't cancel my decision.

1:28:03.104 --> 1:28:04.396
Make way.

1:28:08.729 --> 1:28:10.604
Step aside. Step aside.

1:28:15.687 --> 1:28:17.562
Is the car waiting for me?

1:28:19.146 --> 1:28:20.146
For me.

1:28:22.396 --> 1:28:23.896
I wanted to say goodbye.

1:28:26.771 --> 1:28:28.021
Take care of him.

1:28:28.479 --> 1:28:31.771
Tell your boyfriend
not to stick his neck out, okay?

1:28:36.146 --> 1:28:37.187
Good luck.

1:28:56.812 --> 1:28:57.854
Good luck.

1:29:20.104 --> 1:29:22.771
That's what those two
days were like to me:

1:29:23.104 --> 1:29:25.896
September 16th and 17th.

1:29:26.479 --> 1:29:29.896
There were 872 of such days in total.

1:29:30.646 --> 1:29:33.104
My father was killed
at Nevsky Pyatachok.

1:29:33.187 --> 1:29:37.146
My mother worked for the editor's office
for as long as she could walk.

1:29:37.354 --> 1:29:41.646
But in December of 1942,
she froze to death in our apartment.

1:29:46.771 --> 1:29:51.354
Every day, each of us did as much
as we could to fight the enemy,

1:29:51.437 --> 1:29:56.187
saving oneself and one's relatives,
and saving Leningrad.

1:30:04.021 --> 1:30:09.021
"Barge 752"

1:30:43.312 --> 1:30:46.104
SAVING LENINGRAD
