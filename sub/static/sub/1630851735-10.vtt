WEBVTT

00:09.708 --> 00:12.708
Do you need a hug?

00:12.791 --> 00:14.208
Fucking what?

00:14.291 --> 00:16.583
This whole time Bear-o was the mole?

00:16.666 --> 00:18.916
Yeah, and conveniently not me.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.458
I call bullshit on this plot twist.
I still think it was Brett.

00:22.541 --> 00:23.375
What?

00:23.458 --> 00:25.291
Why would you do any of this?

00:25.375 --> 00:27.583
Steal the file? Shut down the company?

00:27.666 --> 00:28.833
Tank my promotion?

00:29.500 --> 00:30.916
My prime directive.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.625
Bear-o is supposed to make Reagan happy.

00:33.708 --> 00:35.750
I'm not unhappy, Bear-o. I'm just…

00:35.833 --> 00:37.750
How do you explain
resting bitch face to a robot?

00:37.833 --> 00:39.750
See, her neutral face looks pissed,

00:39.833 --> 00:41.583
but it doesn't mean that she's mad…

00:41.666 --> 00:44.333
…except for when she is mad,
which is usually.

00:45.500 --> 00:47.208
I've been watching you,

00:47.291 --> 00:48.666
and you are not happy.

00:48.750 --> 00:50.833
Look at your cortisol levels,

00:50.916 --> 00:52.250
your sleep patterns,

00:52.333 --> 00:54.500
your Adderall consumption.

00:54.583 --> 00:57.250
You're wasting your life
for a company you hate,

00:57.333 --> 00:59.791
with coworkers who want to kill you.

00:59.875 --> 01:01.625
I'm taking this place down

01:01.708 --> 01:03.791
so you can be free.

01:04.291 --> 01:06.250
Remember your life dream, Reagan?

01:06.333 --> 01:08.250
You were going to be a Lego astronaut

01:08.333 --> 01:11.166
and get married on Mars to NSYNC.

01:11.750 --> 01:14.958
NSYNC? That was my dream
when I was eight years old.

01:15.708 --> 01:18.416
Leak file. Destroy Cognito.

01:18.500 --> 01:20.166
Better work-life balance.

01:20.250 --> 01:21.541
Happiness achieved.

01:22.916 --> 01:26.083
No, Bear-o.
I'm giving you new orders.

01:27.166 --> 01:29.208
Access key? Fuck. Uh…

01:29.291 --> 01:30.791
Try "password 123."

01:30.875 --> 01:33.208
-That's what I use for all my passwords.

01:33.291 --> 01:36.833
Why do we even have the NSA
when you make it so damn easy?

01:36.916 --> 01:38.875
-Denied.

01:38.958 --> 01:39.958
Enough talk.

01:40.041 --> 01:42.250
I don't negotiate with bearorists.

01:45.166 --> 01:46.833
Holy shit, he did it.

01:46.916 --> 01:48.500
Glenn was useful!

01:51.416 --> 01:53.666
Dad, did you make Bear-o indestructible?

01:53.750 --> 01:56.041
What? Kids are always breaking shit.

01:56.125 --> 01:57.458
Recalculating.

01:57.541 --> 01:59.041
New directive.

02:02.166 --> 02:05.708
Bear-o must eliminate
the people making Reagan sad.

02:05.791 --> 02:07.250
-Everybody, run!

02:11.916 --> 02:14.291
Bear-o enjoys hide-and-seek.

02:14.375 --> 02:17.958
Fuck. If we don't get that shutdown code,
Bear-o will kill everyone.

02:21.041 --> 02:22.250
What the hell is it?

02:22.333 --> 02:24.375
I don't know.
I let you set it when you were eight

02:24.458 --> 02:27.541
because, of the two of us,
you seemed like the responsible one.

02:27.625 --> 02:28.500
Seriously?

02:28.583 --> 02:31.541
God, I'm sick of your issues.
Why don't you take your Terminator

02:31.625 --> 02:34.208
and have him hunt down
psychiatric help for you?

02:34.291 --> 02:36.125
Hey, my dad was innocent

02:36.208 --> 02:38.375
and the only one here
who didn't turn on me.

02:38.458 --> 02:39.583
A lot of tension in the room,

02:39.666 --> 02:42.083
but how dope is it
that none of us were the mole, huh?

02:42.166 --> 02:43.291
The gang is back.

02:43.375 --> 02:45.750
You mean the one
that was Battle Royale-ing each other

02:45.833 --> 02:46.708
20 minutes ago?

02:46.791 --> 02:49.250
All it took was months
of constant near misses

02:49.333 --> 02:51.583
with the apocalypse for us to fall apart.

02:51.666 --> 02:53.583
Normally violence makes me horny,

02:53.666 --> 02:54.875
but this is too much.

02:54.958 --> 02:56.875
I need to do something
less toxic with my life,

02:56.958 --> 02:58.500
like run Michael Jackson's estate.

02:58.583 --> 03:00.000
-This is too much for me.

03:00.083 --> 03:01.541
You guys are quitting on me?

03:01.625 --> 03:04.541
We don't need
you low-IQ backstabbers anyway.

03:04.625 --> 03:07.000
Team Ridley can take it from here.

03:10.250 --> 03:12.083
I guess it's settled, then.

03:12.166 --> 03:13.916
Coworkers spotted.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.041
-Go. I'll cover you.

03:16.125 --> 03:17.333
-Whoa!

03:22.291 --> 03:23.250
I'm not leaving.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.583
Reagan forever. Ride or die.

03:25.666 --> 03:27.791
Or possibly ride and die.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.041
Should… should I be writing out a will?

03:30.125 --> 03:32.000
I call dibs on his kidneys.

03:56.166 --> 03:58.833
How the hell am I gonna remember
that shutdown code?

03:58.916 --> 04:00.750
I've had a lot of blackouts, kids.

04:00.833 --> 04:03.958
Trust me when I say
the baggage is still there somewhere.

04:04.041 --> 04:07.125
Is there any sci-fi type of way
to access your childhood memories,

04:07.208 --> 04:08.166
like Inception

04:08.250 --> 04:10.916
or like that South Park episode
that was a parody of Inception?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.375
-Wait, I got it.

04:13.375 --> 04:15.541
You know, back in the '80s,
I built a helmet

04:15.625 --> 04:17.333
to access Ronald Reagan's memories

04:17.416 --> 04:20.375
whenever he came down
with a case of "quiet dignity."

04:20.458 --> 04:22.375
We called it Project Jellybean,

04:22.458 --> 04:24.583
which is what he called
his dementia pills.

04:24.666 --> 04:26.333
-Would it still work?
-In theory.

04:26.416 --> 04:30.041
But we'd need a whole tank full
of psycho-conductive fluid to restart it.

04:30.125 --> 04:32.500
-And where the hell we gonna get--
-Myc's tank!

04:33.500 --> 04:36.166
Ooh, a mind journey.
Man, I can't wait to relive

04:36.250 --> 04:38.833
all our dopest moments together
in your brain

04:38.916 --> 04:40.416
with your fully exonerated father.

04:40.500 --> 04:43.500
Take a hike, J.Crew.
You're out of your depth.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.916
Look, I really messed up today
accusing your dad,

04:46.000 --> 04:47.500
and I wanna make it up to you.

04:47.583 --> 04:49.041
I…

04:49.541 --> 04:53.125
Sweetie, I know this guy is like
your emotional support dog or whatever,

04:53.208 --> 04:56.625
but he abandoned you
and tried to get me eaten by sharks.

04:56.708 --> 04:58.041
When you put it that way…

04:58.125 --> 05:00.750
Sorry, Brett, but I think
Team Ridley will handle this one.

05:00.833 --> 05:02.875
You be on guard duty, okay?

05:02.958 --> 05:05.041
-But, Reagan--
-And don't touch anything.

05:05.125 --> 05:08.000
This is a science lab,
not a Dave & Buster's.

05:09.208 --> 05:12.333
All right, Dad, let's do
what no therapist has ever been able to,

05:12.416 --> 05:14.000
get inside my head.

05:15.416 --> 05:19.041
We find the password, shut down Bear-o,
and save the company.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.416
Corkboard? Red yarn?

05:31.500 --> 05:34.291
Oh no, it's a giant conspiracy board.

05:37.250 --> 05:40.750
Even in my brain, I'm a paranoid maniac
who shops at Michaels.

05:40.833 --> 05:43.291
What you're seeing
is a hypnagogic self-projection

05:43.375 --> 05:44.250
of your own mind.

05:44.333 --> 05:46.083
It's how you see your own thoughts.

05:46.666 --> 05:50.291
-So these Polaroids are my memories?
-Everyone's looks different.

05:50.375 --> 05:53.583
Mine was an alleyway with hobos
that all had the face of my father.

05:53.666 --> 05:54.500
Ugh.

05:54.583 --> 05:57.875
Point is, the stakes
are as high as the concept down here.

05:57.958 --> 06:00.791
If you stare too deep at your trauma,
you could go insane.

06:00.875 --> 06:02.500
We need to stay on course.

06:02.583 --> 06:05.250
Looks like my good memories are over here,

06:05.333 --> 06:07.291
my intrusive thoughts here…

06:07.375 --> 06:09.875
Hey,
should you stab your own hand?

06:09.958 --> 06:12.583
-C-c-could be interesting!

06:13.708 --> 06:17.125
Those creepy scribbly ones
are probably all my repressed shit.

06:17.208 --> 06:18.958
Jesus, that pile is huge.

06:19.041 --> 06:23.208
Eh, most of that is probably all the times
your mother talked about her yoni.

06:23.291 --> 06:26.625
Hey, it's that weaselly kid
who always came in after me

06:26.708 --> 06:27.916
at the science fair.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.791
-What was his name again?
-What, who cares? He's probably dead.

06:30.875 --> 06:33.000
God, it's on the tip of my-- Whoa!

06:33.083 --> 06:35.291
Hey, hey, hey!
We shouldn't get distracted.

06:38.666 --> 06:40.500
Hey, glasses, what's your name?

06:40.583 --> 06:42.541
Uh, Orrin Carthwait.

06:42.625 --> 06:44.791
Ah, thank you.

06:44.875 --> 06:46.916
Holy shit, I remember.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.458
-Huh? Kid's name?
-Me asking.

06:49.541 --> 06:52.791
The old crazy lady
who came into my classroom that day.

06:52.875 --> 06:55.333
Oh my God, that how I remember myself?

06:55.416 --> 06:58.625
Okay, there's no telling what damage
altering my memories could do.

06:58.708 --> 07:01.625
We need to search for the shutdown code
in my Bear-o memories.

07:01.708 --> 07:03.333
All right, just gotta limber up.

07:03.416 --> 07:04.291
-Ooh.

07:04.875 --> 07:06.833
This one has Bear-o. Come on.

07:06.916 --> 07:08.791
Welcome to Jurassic party.

07:08.875 --> 07:10.583
Happy birthday, kiddo.

07:10.666 --> 07:12.708
-What are you gonna wish for?
-Friends?

07:12.791 --> 07:15.875
No. Wish to crush your enemies.
Right, honey?

07:17.333 --> 07:20.250
Wow, I feel confident about this marriage.

07:20.333 --> 07:21.916
No one came to my party,

07:22.000 --> 07:25.291
even though I made a velociraptor bot
to ride and everything.

07:27.291 --> 07:29.875
Chin up, kiddo. Friends are temporary.

07:29.958 --> 07:31.500
Murder bots are forever.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.375
Oh hey, look, sweetie,
someone actually showed up.

07:35.375 --> 07:37.583
Oh hey, say hello to Mr. Chompy.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.583
-Don't mind the squirrel guts.

07:39.666 --> 07:41.958
I'm too young to die!

07:42.041 --> 07:45.125
So just running back to the car
for a jacket or…

07:45.208 --> 07:46.833
Screw that loser kid.

07:47.416 --> 07:51.166
Ugh, why do all my parties end with people
screaming about not wanting to die?

07:51.250 --> 07:53.750
Okay, nothing about a shutdown code here.
Let's go.

07:54.291 --> 07:57.333
-Whoa, what the hell? Did you see that?

07:57.416 --> 08:00.750
We must be damaging your memory
just being here. Come on.

08:08.125 --> 08:10.125
Save yourself, Stem Cell Steve.

08:15.416 --> 08:17.208
Killer sharks, death.

08:17.291 --> 08:19.541
Psycho bear, death.

08:19.625 --> 08:21.416
Shadow prison transport tube…

08:21.500 --> 08:22.416
Torture?

08:23.416 --> 08:26.458
Take my goddamn fingernails.
I'm getting in that tube!

08:26.541 --> 08:29.666
Not before me you're not.
I'll shank you new gills, motherfucker.

08:29.750 --> 08:32.500
I'm not picky. I prefer toilet wine.

08:32.583 --> 08:35.666
Do you have any idea
what this ass will go for in the yard?

08:38.833 --> 08:41.375
Destroy coworkers, achieved.

08:41.458 --> 08:43.625
Eliminate Rand Ridley.

08:46.250 --> 08:48.250
Dear diary, the gang is no more,

08:48.333 --> 08:50.083
and Reagan has left me behind.

08:50.166 --> 08:52.458
Friendship status, unknown.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.083
I'll think of a way
to regain your trust, Reagan,

08:55.166 --> 08:58.166
even if it's the last thing I--

09:01.875 --> 09:03.791
Oh crap.
Oh crap, they can't see me in here.

09:03.875 --> 09:05.250
Ah! Not again!

09:06.083 --> 09:07.208
-What the--

09:07.291 --> 09:10.958
Ha. Aren't you a little overdressed
for the science lab, dork?

09:11.041 --> 09:13.666
Why don't you
go to homecoming with a book?

09:13.750 --> 09:15.791
-Literacy burn. Nice!

09:15.875 --> 09:19.416
-Oh my God, she's so weird.

09:19.500 --> 09:22.083
Hey, don't worry about them,
little Reagan-- I… I mean, girl.

09:22.166 --> 09:24.208
Someday, you'll get to have
a homecoming too.

09:24.291 --> 09:27.250
This is my homecoming.
I'm a high school senior.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.083
Oh, right. You're a genius.

09:29.166 --> 09:32.916
Thank God someone finally said it.
Too bad no one will go with me.

09:33.916 --> 09:36.958
Um, I know I probably shouldn't interact
with your memories…

09:37.041 --> 09:37.875
My what now?

09:37.958 --> 09:40.416
…but I could take you to the dance.

09:40.500 --> 09:44.125
Hey, good thing I always keep
a bow tie on hand for dance-mergencies.

09:44.208 --> 09:48.375
Sure. I guess you seem harmless
for a guy that appeared in my bushes.

09:48.458 --> 09:50.750
-Name's Reagan.
-Hi, Reagan, I'm Brett.

09:50.833 --> 09:53.416
Hold on. Mom, Dad?

09:53.500 --> 09:56.208
I'm going to the dance
with a stranger in his thirties.

09:56.291 --> 09:59.166
All right.
Have fun, honey. Be back whenever.

09:59.250 --> 10:02.083
If you meet any college boys,
bring one back for me.

10:02.666 --> 10:04.916
Come on,
this one definitely has Bear-o in it.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.250
Give a hand to the team
from Thomas Jefferson Elementary.

10:08.333 --> 10:11.958
Boo! I've seen better science
in a Louisiana textbook.

10:12.041 --> 10:14.541
And now for our next solo entrant,

10:14.625 --> 10:15.833
Reagan Ridley.

10:16.458 --> 10:19.083
Last semester,
we learned about dissecting frogs,

10:19.166 --> 10:22.666
but cutting open a frog
doesn't prepare you for real surgery,

10:22.750 --> 10:23.750
until now.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.208
While I have the organs of a man,

10:27.291 --> 10:29.791
I lack your immortal soul.

10:29.875 --> 10:31.458
Fie unto thee!

10:32.458 --> 10:35.916
Man, I really need to cut back
on all the playing God.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.708
And the top score goes to Reagan Ridley.

10:39.791 --> 10:42.250
-You did it, Reagan.
-We did it, Orrin.

10:42.333 --> 10:46.000
Hold on. There's that kid
with the unforgettably bad bowl cut again.

10:46.083 --> 10:48.833
Why would there be two different versions
of a memory in my head?

10:48.916 --> 10:52.041
I don't know. We're hacking your brain
in a tub of mushroom jizz.

10:52.125 --> 10:53.458
Weird shit's gonna happen.

10:53.541 --> 10:54.750
I need to figure this out.

10:57.125 --> 11:00.041
From hell's heart, I dissect thee!

11:05.166 --> 11:06.791
What? This isn't Shadow prison.

11:06.875 --> 11:11.125
We'd be in the big house right now
if it wasn't for your big ass, dolphin!

11:11.208 --> 11:12.916
Beakers, welding equipment,

11:13.000 --> 11:15.791
a bodywash/shampoo/toothpaste.

11:15.875 --> 11:17.333
We're in Reagan's lab.

11:17.416 --> 11:20.041
There's gotta be
some mad-scientist bullshit in here

11:20.125 --> 11:21.250
that can help me escape.

11:21.333 --> 11:24.208
Fuck that noise.
I'm the one getting out of here.

11:27.666 --> 11:29.916
Holy shit, it's Justin Timberlake

11:30.000 --> 11:31.875
and four other men
that seem vaguely familiar.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.916
Oh my God, it can't be.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.541
We reunited for a gig

11:35.625 --> 11:38.000
but then got ambushed by a robot bear.

11:38.083 --> 11:41.125
Bear-o must've kidnapped NSYNC for Reagan

11:41.208 --> 11:45.083
and strung them up
like the cover of No Strings Attached.

11:45.166 --> 11:47.375
Why do you know so much about NSYNC?

11:47.458 --> 11:50.791
-That album got me through Kosovo!
-What the hell is this?

11:53.416 --> 11:56.666
Reagan emotional tribute
to the team, take 28.

11:56.750 --> 12:00.041
Hey, guys, I'm prerecording this
before my first day as boss

12:00.125 --> 12:03.250
because I'm not really all that good
with the mushy stuff.

12:03.333 --> 12:04.583
I used to think

12:04.666 --> 12:07.708
that I could do everything by myself,

12:07.791 --> 12:09.291
but I can't,

12:09.375 --> 12:10.625
and I don't want to.

12:10.708 --> 12:12.666
I love this team.

12:12.750 --> 12:15.291
I love Gigi and Glenn's fearlessness,

12:15.375 --> 12:17.000
Andre's originality.

12:17.083 --> 12:20.500
I love how Myc's shittiness
makes all of us look better in comparison.

12:20.583 --> 12:21.416
Wow.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.416
It's hard to tell
because her face doesn't emote,

12:23.500 --> 12:25.333
but it kinda seems like she means it.

12:25.416 --> 12:27.000
What I'm trying to say is…

12:27.083 --> 12:28.750
Shit, I gotta start over.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.750
Hey, can we NSYNC up
with you guys for a second?

12:33.833 --> 12:35.708
We were a team once, just like you,

12:35.791 --> 12:38.458
but we thought we'd be better solo,
and look what happened.

12:38.541 --> 12:41.000
I ended up a judge
in a basic-cable reality show.

12:41.083 --> 12:43.916
I ended up selling hot dogs
and hair plugs.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.875
I wanted to go to space.
They wouldn't let me.

12:45.958 --> 12:47.375
And I hosted SNL five times,

12:47.458 --> 12:49.916
played the Super Bowl halftime show,
was nominated for an Oscar,

12:50.000 --> 12:51.500
and sold 56 million albums.

12:52.083 --> 12:55.416
-But it wasn't the same without you guys.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.875
Goddamn it, NSYNC, you're right.

12:57.958 --> 13:01.416
-We've got to save our Timberlake!
-Yeah, let's do it!

13:01.500 --> 13:02.875
-Yeah!
-Let's do this!

13:02.958 --> 13:04.625
Wait, aren't you gonna free us?

13:04.708 --> 13:07.791
I have a total request, to be alive!

13:09.458 --> 13:11.000
This lab is so cold.

13:15.291 --> 13:17.666
So why are you taking a kid to homecoming?

13:17.750 --> 13:21.666
Let's just say I let a friend down,
and this is my way of making it up to you.

13:21.750 --> 13:24.000
-I mean, her.
-Sir, do you have brain damage?

13:25.208 --> 13:26.875
The doctors are not sure.

13:29.291 --> 13:32.625
Ew. The gifted kid's here with her dad.

13:34.583 --> 13:35.458
Hey, I'm not her dad.

13:35.541 --> 13:38.125
I'm her best friend
she met on the side of the road.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.458
-Ha ha. You suck!

13:42.541 --> 13:44.333
I thought taking a child
to a high school dance

13:44.416 --> 13:46.791
would make things better,
but it's like it just made it worse.

13:46.875 --> 13:48.458
Who could have predicted this?

13:48.541 --> 13:51.166
There, there. The only thing
I think you could be accused of

13:51.250 --> 13:52.708
is caring too much

13:52.791 --> 13:56.416
or abduction of a child,
but your heart was in the right place.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.708
-Thanks. I'm sorry I brought you here.

13:58.791 --> 14:01.916
-It's okay. I was coming anyway.
-But I thought you didn't have a date.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.833
Oh, I've got a date all right,

14:03.916 --> 14:05.333
with justice!

14:07.541 --> 14:10.125
Oh my God, it's blood!

14:10.208 --> 14:13.333
Why would something bad
happen to someone popular?

14:13.416 --> 14:18.208
That's for stealing all my test tubes
to use as shot glasses, Gretchen!

14:18.291 --> 14:20.625
-This is for the rest of you dickheads!

14:26.208 --> 14:27.250
Oh my God.

14:27.333 --> 14:30.958
Wait, did you just reverse-Carrie
your entire high school?

14:31.041 --> 14:33.541
Wow, you are one resourceful,

14:33.625 --> 14:35.083
terrifying little girl.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.791
Hey, that's the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

14:37.875 --> 14:39.875
-I'm gonna write that in my diary.

14:39.958 --> 14:41.333
Whoa, high tech.

14:41.416 --> 14:43.500
Don't you password protect everything?

14:43.583 --> 14:45.958
I'm a one password kind of guy.

14:46.041 --> 14:48.791
Me too, actually.
I've had the same password forever.

14:48.875 --> 14:51.708
-Don't really know why.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.208
I didn't wanna have to do this,

14:53.291 --> 14:56.500
but it's time to look for that passcode
in my repressed memories.

14:56.583 --> 14:58.708
If I yell "puberty,"
don't ask any questions.

14:58.791 --> 15:01.000
-Just duck, cover, and hold.
-Reagan, wait.

15:01.083 --> 15:02.833
It could be dangerous, honey.

15:02.916 --> 15:05.875
Sometimes information
is redacted for a reason.

15:05.958 --> 15:08.208
If anyone knew that 9/11
was actually caused by--

15:10.416 --> 15:12.791
See, even here I can't say it out loud.

15:12.875 --> 15:14.708
You're hiding something.

15:16.291 --> 15:17.333
No, I'm not.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.500
This has to do
with those glitches, doesn't it?

15:19.583 --> 15:21.791
What? What glitches? You're a glitch.

15:21.875 --> 15:24.875
Why were you really sneaking into Cognito?

15:24.958 --> 15:27.625
Why did you really not want
Brett here with us?

15:27.708 --> 15:29.250
-I'm going in.

15:30.583 --> 15:33.583
Honey, I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to protect you.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.791
This yarn can't hold me. It's a metaphor.

15:41.958 --> 15:44.500
Don't go in there.
There's things you can't know.

15:44.583 --> 15:45.583
Look at my face.

15:45.666 --> 15:47.833
This is what knowing stuff
does to your skin!

15:58.375 --> 16:00.583
Here comes the gun, motherfucker.

16:01.500 --> 16:04.250
-Oh no.

16:04.333 --> 16:06.750
-Fuck no.
-Ooh, okay, new plan.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.458
How the hell
we gonna fight a killer robot?

16:08.541 --> 16:09.708
I'll tell ya how.

16:09.791 --> 16:13.000
Like I learned the day I got let go
from the fire department,

16:13.083 --> 16:16.208
sometimes you have to fight fire
with fire.

16:18.041 --> 16:20.708
Ah, yes, I've been expecting you.

16:20.791 --> 16:22.125
How's that possible?

16:22.208 --> 16:24.291
I've been staring at the door
continuously for months.

16:24.375 --> 16:26.083
Eventually, something was bound to happen.

16:26.166 --> 16:27.000
No, no, no, no.

16:27.083 --> 16:30.583
We're gonna let out a homicidal robot
to fight another homicidal robot?

16:30.666 --> 16:33.208
Duh. So they can homicide each other.

16:33.291 --> 16:37.375
Glenn, if I look down,
you better not have a war boner right now.

16:37.458 --> 16:39.500
He's got one. I'm boner height.

16:39.583 --> 16:40.708
Hell yeah!

16:40.791 --> 16:43.416
What makes you think
I'll help you horny idiots?

16:43.500 --> 16:45.416
Oh, you think you're hot shit, don't you?

16:45.500 --> 16:47.916
Well, I'm gonna tell you
what I told Leonardo DiCaprio

16:48.000 --> 16:50.125
when he begged me to rig the Oscars.

16:50.208 --> 16:52.875
If you were the best, ya woulda won.

16:53.375 --> 16:56.125
I am the most advanced
artificial intelligence in existence!

16:56.208 --> 16:57.500
Sure about that, honey?

16:57.583 --> 16:59.500
Because right now,
that glorified hugging machine

16:59.583 --> 17:02.833
is doing what you couldn't.
Handing us our asses.

17:02.916 --> 17:06.833
A fluke. I have calculated
over 32,000 ass-handing scenarios.

17:06.916 --> 17:08.250
Okay, well, then prove it.

17:08.333 --> 17:09.583
Because if we all die,

17:09.666 --> 17:13.250
you'll spend the next 2,000 years
being the smartest robot in this tube.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.958
Or you can be my Leonardo DiCaprio,

17:16.041 --> 17:19.708
go out there, fight with a bear
until you take home the gold.

17:19.791 --> 17:23.166
Fine. If you guys
let me leave this tube once in a while.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.791
I'm ready to reclaim my dignity.

17:27.208 --> 17:29.833
-This is not what I had in mind.

17:29.916 --> 17:32.166
But fine, patch me
into your computer systems.

17:33.458 --> 17:37.000
We're disabling external Wi-Fi.
We can't risk you launching the nukes.

17:37.083 --> 17:39.041
Or discovering what furries are.

17:39.125 --> 17:40.833
They're a valid community.

17:40.916 --> 17:43.041
It's not always a sexual thing,

17:43.125 --> 17:44.083
but usually.

17:56.208 --> 17:58.833
Oh, there's been this one spot
on my back I could not reach.

18:01.208 --> 18:04.791
Dr. and Mrs. Ridley,
Reagan is exceptionally gifted.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.625
She has the highest test scores
I've ever seen.

18:07.708 --> 18:09.000
Damn right, she does.

18:09.083 --> 18:11.708
I brag about her to my guru all the time.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.250
I'd be crazy not to recommend

18:13.333 --> 18:16.375
that she skip the rest
of elementary and middle school.

18:16.458 --> 18:19.791
-Then it's settled.
-But she's finally made a friend.

18:19.875 --> 18:23.333
Orrin. He's my new best friend.
No offense, Bear-o.

18:23.416 --> 18:25.708
And it might serve her well
to stay in fourth grade

18:25.791 --> 18:29.250
so she can wean herself
off of that, uh, comfort bear.

18:30.666 --> 18:33.708
Can't stare directly at it
per my therapist.

18:33.791 --> 18:36.041
-Can I stay in fourth grade?
-Out of the question.

18:36.125 --> 18:37.916
He'll weaken you with his mediocrity.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.958
Look, he's got his shirt on backwards.

18:40.041 --> 18:43.250
Oh God, now he's got
his tongue stuck to a pole.

18:43.333 --> 18:44.416
But, Dad…

18:44.500 --> 18:45.625
I had a friend?

18:45.708 --> 18:47.250
Why would I repress that?

18:47.333 --> 18:49.750
What is going on?

18:50.541 --> 18:52.500
Comfort bear.

18:52.583 --> 18:54.791
No, I need to know what happened.

18:54.875 --> 18:56.458
I had a friend?

19:01.416 --> 19:02.416
Oh my God.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.833
Someone was experimenting on me?

19:04.916 --> 19:06.916
Erasing my memories?

19:07.416 --> 19:08.375
And it was…

19:09.750 --> 19:10.833
Dad?!

19:16.916 --> 19:20.375
Hey, Shitty Ruxpin,
when I'm done with you,

19:20.458 --> 19:23.958
you'll be playing banjo
in a strip-mall pizza arcade.

19:24.041 --> 19:25.833
Bear-o's perfect endgame,

19:25.916 --> 19:28.000
where a kid can be a kid.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.416
Let them fight.

19:29.500 --> 19:32.291
You will pay for your hubris, Bear.

19:36.208 --> 19:38.333
This is truly a toxic workplace.

19:38.416 --> 19:42.000
Oh, you have no idea
how toxic it can get, Care Bear.

19:42.083 --> 19:43.625
I'm not a Care Bear.

19:43.708 --> 19:45.875
Now Bear-o stare!

19:47.333 --> 19:48.291
-Oh!

19:48.375 --> 19:49.208
Fuck yeah!

19:50.125 --> 19:53.041
Allow me to put this
into words you'll understand.

19:53.125 --> 19:54.791
Get fucked, Smokey!

19:56.041 --> 19:57.500
Oh God! No!

19:58.000 --> 20:00.291
-No. You fools!

20:04.166 --> 20:06.083
Shit. He has no neck.

20:06.166 --> 20:08.375
Stay low and close so he can't see you.

20:11.208 --> 20:14.458
I don't wanna skip fourth grade.
What are you doing, Dad?

20:14.541 --> 20:17.333
I'm saving you from a life
of middling achievement.

20:17.416 --> 20:20.250
Bear-o,
dial up the dopamine levels by 15%.

20:22.208 --> 20:25.083
Look, I know J.R.'s got it out for me.

20:26.458 --> 20:28.208
If I'm ever axed from this company,

20:28.291 --> 20:31.083
I need an insurance policy
to get me back in.

20:31.166 --> 20:35.916
And if Daddy's little insurance policy
gets off track by befriending some idiot,

20:36.000 --> 20:37.958
the Ridley empire crumbles.

20:40.375 --> 20:42.916
Perfect.
Isolating memory patterns matching…

20:43.000 --> 20:46.291
…Orrin Carthwait.
What kind of name is that?

20:46.375 --> 20:48.583
I'm saving this kid
from a life in the friend zone.

20:48.666 --> 20:49.958
What? No. Why?

20:52.375 --> 20:54.250
And friend erased.

20:54.333 --> 20:55.625
Goodbye, fourth grade.

20:55.708 --> 20:58.458
Hello, youngest Nobel Prize winner ever.

20:59.708 --> 21:00.833
Hey there, Jelly Bean.

21:00.916 --> 21:03.833
Who's your best friend
in the whole wide world?

21:03.916 --> 21:05.416
Uh, I don't know.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.875
You? And Bear-o?

21:07.958 --> 21:08.791
You fucking…

21:09.875 --> 21:10.875
…monster!

21:11.708 --> 21:13.666
-Uh, Dad?
-What the…

21:13.750 --> 21:15.375
An adult version of my daughter?

21:15.458 --> 21:17.125
Crap, I'm a memory, aren't I?

21:17.208 --> 21:20.458
Welp, if we're all just neurons,
might as well start early.

21:25.875 --> 21:28.500
Now does Reagan need a hug?

21:28.583 --> 21:30.291
-Oh my God!

21:31.291 --> 21:33.541
Guys? You came back?

21:33.625 --> 21:35.666
You're our Timberlake, Reagan!

21:35.750 --> 21:39.625
Turns out it's not gonna be me.
It's gonna be us!

21:39.708 --> 21:40.708
Okay.

21:42.083 --> 21:44.833
You literally fucked with my head?

21:44.916 --> 21:47.833
-Screw Bear-o! I'll kill you myself!
-Whoa!

21:47.916 --> 21:50.583
Does that mean
she's not gonna help us?

21:50.666 --> 21:53.458
I had a friend, a real friend,

21:53.541 --> 21:54.583
and you erased him!

21:54.666 --> 21:55.666
Big deal.

21:55.750 --> 21:58.625
All friends do is hold people back.

21:58.708 --> 22:00.125
I can't hold him back.

22:01.166 --> 22:04.000
You want Bear-o
to be my only friend? Fine.

22:04.083 --> 22:06.166
Hey, Bear-o, you win.

22:06.250 --> 22:07.375
But if you let my friends go,

22:07.458 --> 22:10.541
then I promise to never see
any of them ever again.

22:10.625 --> 22:12.708
Bear-o will speed up the process.

22:13.291 --> 22:15.833
-Oh my God!
-No! No! Stop!

22:15.916 --> 22:17.833
Bear-o is your only friend.

22:21.625 --> 22:23.958
Orrin! The password is Orrin!

22:24.541 --> 22:25.541
Wait, Orrin.

22:25.625 --> 22:28.291
That's the password! That's what I forgot!

22:28.375 --> 22:31.666
Enter access key O-R-R-I-N.

22:31.750 --> 22:33.041
System override.

22:43.208 --> 22:44.041
What?

22:44.125 --> 22:45.583
-Fuck that bear!
-Great!

22:45.666 --> 22:46.958
Brett, you saved us!

22:47.041 --> 22:48.125
We saved us.

22:50.291 --> 22:53.375
Bravo, Reagan.
The way you manipulated that bear

22:53.458 --> 22:56.250
into thinking you gave a shit
about your coworkers? Ha!

22:56.333 --> 22:58.041
I do give a shit about them.

22:58.125 --> 23:00.458
What I need boundaries from is you.

23:00.541 --> 23:01.791
Okay, I hear you.

23:01.875 --> 23:03.791
I'll order
one of those paper curtain thingies

23:03.875 --> 23:05.791
for the living room
as soon as we get home.

23:05.875 --> 23:08.958
There's some areas a daughter
shouldn't have to see a parent scratch.

23:09.041 --> 23:10.916
Oh, fuck you, Dad.
It's not your home anymore.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.458
Oh, come on.

23:12.541 --> 23:14.708
There are special people like us

23:14.791 --> 23:16.291
who should run the world,

23:16.375 --> 23:18.291
and then there's normies like Orrin,

23:18.375 --> 23:22.666
who deliver our pizza and fight our wars.
Haven't you seen The Incredibles?

23:22.750 --> 23:24.875
I don't give a flying fuck
about The Incredibles!

23:24.958 --> 23:27.125
All right, all right. I fucked up.

23:27.208 --> 23:29.500
I get it.
But we don't have to dwell on it.

23:29.583 --> 23:32.833
Why don't you let me erase
both our memories of this little incident,

23:32.916 --> 23:34.416
and we can go back to normal?

23:39.708 --> 23:41.250
You've got 24 hours.

23:41.333 --> 23:43.625
Pack your shit up,
or I'm dumping it in the Potomac.

23:43.708 --> 23:44.958
The mole is neutralized,

23:45.041 --> 23:47.208
so now I'm officially the boss
around here,

23:47.291 --> 23:50.041
which means
you are never ever setting foot

23:50.125 --> 23:52.875
in this building or my life again.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
-You're making a mistake.

23:56.083 --> 23:57.208
You need me.

23:57.291 --> 23:58.791
I'll be back.

24:00.833 --> 24:03.208
-I'll see all you tomorrow.
-What's tomorrow?

24:03.291 --> 24:05.916
-My first real day as boss.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.333
-All right!
-Tell 'em!

24:17.916 --> 24:20.916
-Morning, boss.
-Sure is a fine day to still be alive.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.416
Don't mention it, Tony.

24:22.500 --> 24:24.166
Hey, about yesterday…

24:24.250 --> 24:27.625
Brett, we're secretly running the world.
We're not gonna get everything right.

24:27.708 --> 24:30.125
And you are the only one
who is honest with me,

24:30.208 --> 24:31.791
even without any truth serum.

24:31.875 --> 24:33.041
So we're good?

24:33.125 --> 24:35.333
I remember what you did for me
at homecoming.

24:35.416 --> 24:37.458
We've been good for 18 years.

24:37.541 --> 24:39.166
Yes! Reagan forever.

24:40.750 --> 24:44.041
-Liking the new digs?
-Thank you for moving me upstairs, Reagan.

24:44.125 --> 24:47.333
It's not as close to world domination
as I'd like, but it's a start.

24:47.416 --> 24:48.416
-Hey, stop that.

24:48.500 --> 24:51.375
Well, that's as much freedom
as you're gonna get with talk like that.

24:56.125 --> 24:59.375
Time to start
my second first day.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.416
Shadow Board.

25:02.500 --> 25:05.416
I am honored
that you have chosen me to helm Cognito.

25:05.500 --> 25:08.708
There's been a change
of plans. After the chaos yesterday,

25:08.791 --> 25:11.875
we feel you may not have
enough experience to be CEO.

25:11.958 --> 25:15.458
Experience.
Are… are you seriously keeping J.R.?

25:15.541 --> 25:19.166
J.R. has been lying to us,
embezzling, and falsifying documents

25:19.250 --> 25:20.750
to purchase a volcano lair.

25:20.833 --> 25:23.708
He's been black-sited
for crimes against the Shadow Board.

25:24.458 --> 25:25.708
No! No! Please!

25:25.791 --> 25:27.458
I'll tell you who Banksy is!

25:29.500 --> 25:32.583
So we've reverted
to the man with the most experience

25:32.666 --> 25:34.958
and shares of the company to be CEO.

25:35.041 --> 25:36.583
Oh, you can't mean…

25:36.666 --> 25:37.791
Hey there, Jelly Bean.

25:37.875 --> 25:39.291
-No!

25:40.250 --> 25:42.250
The Shadow Board has spoken.

25:42.333 --> 25:43.875
How could you do this to me?

25:43.958 --> 25:46.375
Sorry, kid. It's still Team Ridley.

25:46.458 --> 25:48.833
It's just, you know,
I'm the team captain now.

25:48.916 --> 25:50.583
But I get what you meant about boundaries.

25:50.666 --> 25:54.416
Look, paper curtain thingy.
It's like you're not even in this office.

25:54.500 --> 25:56.041
-Huh?
-Oh, you motherfuck--
