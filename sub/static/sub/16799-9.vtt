00:01.200 --> 00:04.590
_ WATSON:
PreVIously, on Elementary...
Bang.

00:04.630 --> 00:06.439
You couldn't find a better
hiding place for this thing?

00:06.470 --> 00:08.358
WATSON:
I want to talk to you
about Shinwell.

00:08.400 --> 00:10.504
And why you approached him at
his apartment the other day.

00:10.540 --> 00:11.802
You got it all backwards.

00:11.840 --> 00:14.138
It wasn't my idea to meet.
It was his.

00:14.180 --> 00:16.501
Do you know what would happen
if a parole officer knew

00:16.550 --> 00:18.199
that you were hanging
out with Tall Boy?

00:18.250 --> 00:19.512
Tall Boy is not your problem.

00:19.550 --> 00:20.642
This world is not safe.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.511
Not for me,
and especially not for you.

00:22.550 --> 00:24.643
So get out.
While you still can.

00:27.660 --> 00:30.549
(exhales)
It's now or never, Doc.

00:33.530 --> 00:35.521
(birds chirping)

00:45.110 --> 00:47.101
(woman screaming)

00:50.650 --> 00:52.641
*

00:53.850 --> 00:56.045
(woman screams)

01:01.760 --> 01:04.684
(muffled screaming)

01:06.660 --> 01:07.627
(screaming)

01:11.300 --> 01:13.188
(screaming)

01:16.740 --> 01:18.469
Hello?

01:18.510 --> 01:19.875
HOLMES: You turned
your phone off, Watson.

01:19.910 --> 01:21.468
Or the battery died.

01:21.510 --> 01:23.478
In either case, shame on you.

01:23.510 --> 01:26.115
(sighs) Actually,
I put it on silent.

01:26.150 --> 01:27.617
I was trying to sleep in.

01:27.650 --> 01:29.618
Double shame.
You know, I...

01:29.650 --> 01:31.481
You're needed
at the scene of a murder.

01:31.520 --> 01:33.818
I'm afraid it's quite urgent.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.669
Where's Marcus?

01:48.700 --> 01:50.600
It's not his case.
The Captain?

01:50.640 --> 01:53.700
I wasn't beckoned here, I heard
about it on one of my scanners.

01:53.740 --> 01:55.503
So, shortly after midnight,
someone called 911

01:55.540 --> 01:58.179
to report the sound
of gunfire in this area.

01:58.210 --> 02:00.644
Police took over an hour
to respond.

02:00.680 --> 02:03.240
When they did,
they saw that body.

02:03.290 --> 02:05.747
They also saw
two men, who fled.

02:05.790 --> 02:08.281
One of them tossed
a gun as he ran. A .38.

02:08.320 --> 02:09.753
Neither of them was apprehended.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.892
the police think
it's gang-related.

02:13.930 --> 02:16.398
Someone died, and that's
terrible, but I don't understand

02:16.430 --> 02:18.694
what we're doing here. We don't
usually work this kind of case.

02:18.730 --> 02:20.391
Especially when
we're not invited.

02:20.440 --> 02:21.930
There's a personal angle.

02:21.970 --> 02:23.665
You knew the victim?

02:23.710 --> 02:25.837
It was the description
of one of the men that ran

02:25.870 --> 02:28.703
that caught my attention.
African-American,

02:28.740 --> 02:31.470
approximately six foot tall,
shaved head, beard,

02:31.510 --> 02:33.375
last seen wearing
a green army jacket.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.445
When I got here, C.S.U.
were photographing

02:35.480 --> 02:37.619
a necklace that caught
on that fence

02:37.650 --> 02:39.311
as he climbed over it.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.657
(camera clicks)

02:42.760 --> 02:45.786
I think that one of the men
the police is looking for

02:45.830 --> 02:47.320
is Shinwell Johnson.

02:49.370 --> 02:52.828
*

03:22.870 --> 03:24.497
Riclq Morales.
Shot twice. First one

03:24.530 --> 03:26.737
is to the back of the head.
Close range.

03:26.770 --> 03:28.499
Second one for good measure.

03:28.540 --> 03:31.338
You think this was an execution?

03:31.370 --> 03:34.828
Riclq here is a known member
of Los Espectros. You familiar?

03:34.880 --> 03:37.804
Yeah. A Salvadoran street
gang out of Queens.

03:37.850 --> 03:38.669
Exactly.

03:38.710 --> 03:40.519
And this is the Bronx.
SBK territory.

03:42.520 --> 03:44.249
South Bronx Killas.

03:44.290 --> 03:46.485
I find it hard to believe
that Riclq came here alone

03:46.520 --> 03:48.818
or of his own free will.
IfI had to guess,

03:48.860 --> 03:51.749
I'd say that he was scooped up
somewhere and brought here.

03:51.790 --> 03:53.496
See, I...
I couldn't help but notice

03:53.530 --> 03:54.792
that the, uh... bullets
used are 8mm,

03:54.830 --> 03:56.991
as opposed to, uh,

03:57.030 --> 03:59.931
.38, which was
the weapon discarded.

03:59.970 --> 04:01.790
Yeah, well, the guy
who didn't toss his gun

04:01.840 --> 04:03.398
probably had the 8mm.

04:03.440 --> 04:05.328
Well, perhaps. What do you think
the chances are

04:05.370 --> 04:07.873
that they used an antique
to kill him?

04:07.910 --> 04:09.878
These are Nambu shells.

04:09.910 --> 04:12.276
They're rimless,
bottleneck cartridges.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.971
They were introduced in Japan in
1904, and they were discontinued

04:15.020 --> 04:16.783
shortly after
the second world war,

04:16.820 --> 04:19.948
as were, uh, the weapons
used to fire them.

04:19.990 --> 04:23.448
Not exactly gang
hardware, is it?

04:23.490 --> 04:24.923
Respectfully,
I can't take your word

04:24.960 --> 04:26.996
that the murder weapon's
over a hundred years old.

04:27.030 --> 04:29.794
I mean, let's let ballistics
do their job, okay?

04:29.830 --> 04:32.025
So, the two men who
ran off, they were here

04:32.070 --> 04:33.890
almost an hour
after the shots were reported.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.396
Don't you think that's odd?

04:35.440 --> 04:37.408
They were probably waiting
for a car to show

04:37.440 --> 04:38.862
so they could
disappear the body.

04:38.910 --> 04:40.639
HOLMES: So, two
members of SBK,

04:42.680 --> 04:45.444
Instead of doing it in an
environment they can control,

04:45.480 --> 04:49.314
they do it here, where the shots
can be heard by witnesses.

04:49.350 --> 04:50.578
They use an antique weapon.

04:50.620 --> 04:52.713
They then linger
for almost an hour,

04:52.760 --> 04:54.557
while they wait
for a car.

04:54.590 --> 04:56.649
Then why wouldn't they use
the car that they came in?

04:56.690 --> 04:59.898
Or do you think they transported
their victim on the subway?

04:59.930 --> 05:02.990
The good news is, we think
there's prints on the .38.

05:03.030 --> 05:04.964
If the guy that tossed it
is in the system,

05:05.000 --> 05:06.968
we'll have his name
In three days.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.798
Well, if his prints are with
AFIS, then it would be sooner

05:09.840 --> 05:11.705
than that, right?
Like, tomorrow morning.

05:11.740 --> 05:14.072
You didn't hear
about the asbestos.

05:15.410 --> 05:16.809
Lab's getting a face-lift.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.408
They found asbestos
in the ceiling.

05:18.450 --> 05:20.008
So, they sent everybody home
for a couple of days.

05:20.050 --> 05:22.416
They're back in now,
but there's a backlog,

05:22.450 --> 05:24.543
so our .38's gonna have
to wait in line.

05:24.590 --> 05:26.854
I mean, like...
what exactly

05:26.890 --> 05:28.687
is Major Cases' interest here?

05:28.720 --> 05:31.359
Isn't, like, a dead
gangbanger a little, like,

05:31.390 --> 05:32.857
straightforward for you guys?

05:32.900 --> 05:34.925
Slow week.

05:37.030 --> 05:38.861
If there's anything we can do
to be of assistance,

05:38.900 --> 05:41.039
please don't hesitate
to contact us at the 11th.

05:42.970 --> 05:45.404
*

05:50.880 --> 05:53.417
Thoughts?
You first.

05:53.450 --> 05:56.510
Shinwell is on parole.
Detective Cosa does not impress.

05:56.550 --> 05:58.086
Think he's responsible?
I don't know.

05:58.120 --> 06:01.089
I mean, SBK was his old gang.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.623
And the last time
I saw him, it...

06:03.660 --> 06:05.127
it went poorly.

06:05.160 --> 06:06.457
How?

06:06.500 --> 06:07.524
He threatened me.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.521
Perhaps I will have a
conversation with Detective Cosa

06:11.570 --> 06:13.663
after all.
No, I wasn't
in any danger.

06:13.700 --> 06:15.167
He's 170 pounds. He's six foot.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.760
It wasn't real. I mean,
the things he said to me,

06:17.810 --> 06:20.005
just... he just wanted to get me
out of the way. I could tell.

06:20.040 --> 06:23.544
Perhaps he wanted you out
of the way so he could
take out a rival.

06:23.580 --> 06:24.899
No.

06:24.950 --> 06:26.713
No. He didn't do this.

06:26.750 --> 06:28.012
But how do you know that?

06:28.050 --> 06:29.915
Ijust... Ijust do.

06:32.590 --> 06:33.887
So, perhaps the description

06:33.920 --> 06:35.512
I overheard was
of another person?

06:35.560 --> 06:37.152
The cross pendant hanging
on the fence?

06:37.190 --> 06:38.657
It's a little harder to dismiss.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.157
Has he responded
to your text?

06:40.200 --> 06:42.566
I told him I wanted to talk.
I haven't heard back.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.465
Just as well. 'Cause the
conversation we're gonna have

06:44.500 --> 06:45.865
is better had in person.

06:50.070 --> 06:52.061
Shinwell, it's Joan.

06:54.540 --> 06:57.077
(quietly): So, you don't
think he killed Ricky Morales.

06:58.180 --> 06:59.738
I also assume
you don't think

06:59.780 --> 07:01.042
he's on the other
side of that door,

07:01.080 --> 07:03.412
pointing a Nambu
pistol at us?

07:05.790 --> 07:08.588
I mean, I can't guarantee it.

07:13.830 --> 07:16.469
*

07:34.520 --> 07:36.943
Wherever he is,
he's left his phone.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.754
Perhaps he's worried the police
might use it to locate him.

07:39.790 --> 07:41.018
(phone cl' '
ICk
Hmm? Ing)

07:41.060 --> 07:42.789
Or he forgot it.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.856
He also forgot to close
those drawers, as one might do

07:45.890 --> 07:47.892
from when they're packing
in a hurry.

07:51.900 --> 07:54.095
His toolbox is gone.
I gave it to him

07:54.140 --> 07:55.869
as a housewarming gift.

07:55.900 --> 07:57.128
The sort of thing
someone might sell

07:57.170 --> 07:57.807
if they were going on the lam.

07:57.840 --> 08:01.105
On a scale from one to ten,

08:01.140 --> 08:02.676
how confident are you
of his innocence now?

08:02.710 --> 08:05.178
I just don't see him killing
someone in cold blood.

08:05.210 --> 08:08.077
I'm gonna call that a four.
Humor me. Pay a visit

08:08.120 --> 08:10.714
to the local pawn shops, see if
he's been around. I'm humor you.

08:10.750 --> 08:12.752
I'm gonna talk
to his old friends in SBK.

08:12.790 --> 08:14.951
See if they can shed some light
on what happened last night.

08:14.990 --> 08:17.857
SBK is a street gang. Why would
they tell you about a shooting

08:17.890 --> 08:19.050
they may have been involved in?

08:19.090 --> 08:21.092
The trick, Watson,

08:21.130 --> 08:23.121
is to not ask
about the shooting.

08:25.300 --> 08:27.188
Wait, now. This dude,

08:27.240 --> 08:29.037
who got held up around
the way last night...

08:29.070 --> 08:31.937
he was a birthday clown?
That's right.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.938
What the hell was a clown
doing out at midnight

08:33.980 --> 08:35.709
in this neighborhood?

08:35.740 --> 08:37.947
As I said, according to
witnesses, he was getting mugged

08:37.980 --> 08:39.709
by someone who happens
to fit your description.

08:39.750 --> 08:41.775
He was relieved of $153

08:41.820 --> 08:43.742
and a bag of balloons.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.781
The NYPD would like to know
if there's anyone

08:45.820 --> 08:47.583
who can account
for your whereabouts.

08:47.620 --> 08:50.088
I was with my boys.
Will and Ray.

08:52.660 --> 08:54.059
Went double O.T.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.226
Lots of people to tell you.

08:55.260 --> 08:58.058
Will Moultrie, Ray Franks?

08:58.100 --> 09:00.068
Yeah. How do you know that?

09:00.100 --> 09:01.988
TALL BOY: Yo.
What's he grilling you on, D?

09:02.040 --> 09:05.237
Big Mike had to answer for
a cigarette truck went missing.

09:05.270 --> 09:07.204
Terry got accused of

09:07.240 --> 09:09.208
busting a vending machine

09:09.240 --> 09:11.242
and jacking some
off-brand Cheese Puffs.

09:11.280 --> 09:14.113
Apparently, there was a
real crime wave last night.

09:14.150 --> 09:17.119
Laquan Eversley. "Tall Boy."
You're an SBK lieutenant.

09:17.150 --> 09:19.015
What the hell is
a "Lef-tennant?"

09:19.050 --> 09:20.688
Oh, it's like a lieutenant.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.256
And you work
for the police, right?

09:22.290 --> 09:24.258
Yes.
So, what is this?

09:24.290 --> 09:26.599
Why are you trying to trip us up
on dirt that never happened?

09:26.630 --> 09:28.325
My intention is not
to implicate anyone

09:28.360 --> 09:30.191
in any fictitious crimes,
I assure you.

09:30.230 --> 09:32.869
You might also hear talk of
a mime who got savagely beaten.

09:32.900 --> 09:34.333
But, uh, pay that no heed.

09:34.370 --> 09:37.168
I'm-a pay it all kinds
of heed until you explain

09:37.210 --> 09:39.064
why you've been
telling stories.
Because there's no need

09:39.110 --> 09:41.169
to lie when the truth will do.

09:41.210 --> 09:43.678
Everyone I've spoken to
has been only too happy

09:43.710 --> 09:46.201
to provide a web of
overlapping alibis

09:46.250 --> 09:48.673
which can be cross-checked.
It's given me a snapshot

09:48.720 --> 09:51.109
of where your group's leadership
was at the precise moment

09:51.150 --> 09:53.084
a member of Los Espectros
was gunned down last night.

09:53.120 --> 09:55.008
And the good news is, I'm
starting starting to think

09:55.060 --> 09:56.618
that none of you
pulled the trigger.

09:56.660 --> 09:58.389
I could've told you that.

09:58.430 --> 10:00.318
Now my cards are on the
table, I'll be more direct.

10:00.360 --> 10:03.864
Do any of you know anyone
who owns a pistol like this?

10:03.900 --> 10:06.391
You're done asking
questions here.

10:06.430 --> 10:08.364
It would be very helpful.
You're done.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.038
Or my next "alibi"

10:10.070 --> 10:11.628
is gonna be for when
the British dude

10:11.670 --> 10:13.399
got curb stomped
in front of Bennie's.

10:13.440 --> 10:16.273
Thank you for
your time, gentlemen.

10:16.310 --> 10:18.301
*

10:22.380 --> 10:24.211
Hey. It's me.

10:24.250 --> 10:26.810
Shinwell did sell his toolbox
and a few other items

10:26.860 --> 10:29.055
at a pawnshop near his building.

10:29.090 --> 10:30.819
So, you were right.
He's on the run.

10:30.860 --> 10:32.794
Call me when you can.

10:38.130 --> 10:40.769
I need your help, Doc.
Something happened last night.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.734
A member of a rival gang
was shot and killed

10:42.770 --> 10:44.829
in SBK territory--
you were there, weren't you?

10:44.870 --> 10:47.100
I didn't have nothin' to do
with what happened to that man.

10:47.140 --> 10:49.199
Next you're gonna tell me
that you're not back with SBK.

10:49.240 --> 10:51.344
It's not what you think.
Then what is it?

10:52.850 --> 10:54.374
You want my help, right?

10:54.420 --> 10:55.773
Here's your phone.

10:55.820 --> 10:57.310
I got it from
your apartment.

10:57.350 --> 10:59.910
Call the police.
Tell them where you are.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.019
Tell them you want to talk
about what happened last night.

11:03.430 --> 11:06.081
Call them, or I will.

11:11.230 --> 11:14.063
Let me tell you a story.

11:14.100 --> 11:17.968
If you don't believe it,
just press "send."

11:22.750 --> 11:24.399
And I'll do anything you say.

11:29.250 --> 11:31.480
Got your message.

11:31.520 --> 11:34.057
_ Our conversations _
With SBK were enlightening,

11:34.090 --> 11:37.958
but I've got no insights
as to Shinwell's current...

11:37.990 --> 11:39.389
whereabouts.

11:39.430 --> 11:40.749
We need to talk.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.051
That's apparent.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.499
He was at the scene
of Riclq Morales'

11:43.530 --> 11:44.792
murder last night.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.229
Only I didn't kill him.

11:46.270 --> 11:47.794
I think it's likely
that you didn't.

11:47.840 --> 11:50.968
And yet, you, crime scene,
police pursuit,

11:51.010 --> 11:53.501
discarded handgun...
I can explain that.

11:53.540 --> 11:56.100
I can explain, too.
You're back in SBK.

11:56.140 --> 11:59.246
More than enough reason
to wash our hands of him, no?
No.

11:59.280 --> 12:01.817
I'm not back in SBK
'cause I want to be.

12:01.850 --> 12:04.341
I'm back in because
I was asked to be.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.346
I'm an informant
for the FBI.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.328
I'd only been out
of prison a few days.

12:11.360 --> 12:15.353
No job yet, just a room
in a halfway house.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.368
I was walking back
from the store one night,

12:17.400 --> 12:19.994
and this dude rolled up
on me in a car.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.496
He showed me his badge.

12:21.540 --> 12:23.030
You said his name
was Whitlock.

12:23.070 --> 12:25.163
Agent Whitlock.

12:25.210 --> 12:26.359
He said he was keeping
an eye on me

12:26.410 --> 12:28.207
when I was
in Great Meadow.

12:28.240 --> 12:30.845
He said he knew that
I was distancing myself

12:30.880 --> 12:32.438
from the dudes
I used to roll with.

12:32.480 --> 12:34.516
Said he knew I got out
on good behavior.

12:34.550 --> 12:36.916
And he said, "Imagine
how much good you can do

12:36.950 --> 12:40.909
if you help bring down SBK
from the inside."

12:42.490 --> 12:45.050
And this is around the time
that, uh, I came to see you.

12:45.090 --> 12:47.058
To ask you how can I change.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.921
Well, I told Whitlock
I was in.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.426
I reached out to old friends,
told them

12:51.470 --> 12:54.234
I can't make ends meet,
that I was unhappy.

12:54.270 --> 12:55.339
So they threw work
my way.

12:55.370 --> 12:56.394
What kind of work?

12:56.440 --> 12:58.101
Collecting for them.

12:58.140 --> 13:00.074
Keeping an eye
on some things.

13:00.110 --> 13:01.338
Whitlock was happy.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.245
The only thing
I didn't count on was

13:03.280 --> 13:05.168
you realizing
that I was back in.

13:05.210 --> 13:06.939
That's why I told you
to stay away,

13:06.980 --> 13:08.845
because I didn't want you
to get caught up in this.

13:08.880 --> 13:11.189
If you didn't kill
Morales, who did?

13:11.220 --> 13:13.256
I don't know.
As far as I can tell,

13:13.290 --> 13:15.178
SBK don't have nothin'
to do with it.

13:15.220 --> 13:18.018
The way I heard it,
a kid heard shots.

13:18.060 --> 13:20.449
He went snooping around,
he found a body.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.491
He called his brother,
Marquis.

13:22.530 --> 13:24.168
He's SBK.

13:24.200 --> 13:26.566
Word went all the way
up to the top.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.431
If the body found
on our territory,

13:28.470 --> 13:30.301
that would have been
a lot of heat.

13:30.340 --> 13:32.467
Well, that would tally with
what I was able to gather.

13:32.510 --> 13:35.104
You and Tall Boy
were in a club.

13:35.140 --> 13:37.301
He got a text around
half past midnight.

13:37.350 --> 13:40.046
You both left.
WATSON: You went
to dispose of the body.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.116
That's why you were at the scene

13:42.150 --> 13:44.141
almost an hour after
the murder took place.

13:44.190 --> 13:46.181
Yeah, the police showed up
right after we did.

13:46.220 --> 13:47.448
But we ran.

13:47.490 --> 13:48.479
Which one of you
threw the gun?

13:48.520 --> 13:49.885
Me.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.899
Tall Boy gave it
to me weeks ago.

13:52.930 --> 13:55.353
He said If I was gonna roll
with SBK,

13:55.400 --> 13:58.164
I had to be strapped up.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.361
So I took it to Whitlock, and
I told him I didn't want it.

14:00.400 --> 14:04.404
He said it would be too
suspicious if I didn't keep it.

14:04.440 --> 14:05.509
So when the prints are lifted,
that'll give the police

14:05.540 --> 14:07.405
probable cause for your arrest.

14:07.440 --> 14:10.238
Possession of a handgun
is a violation of your parole.

14:10.280 --> 14:11.542
WATSON :
The good news is,

14:11.580 --> 14:12.979
there's a logjam at the lab,

14:13.020 --> 14:14.112
so the gun can't be processed

14:14.150 --> 14:15.572
for another 72 hours.

14:15.620 --> 14:17.417
It's more than enough time
to do what we need.

14:17.450 --> 14:19.042
What we need?

14:19.090 --> 14:21.456
Shinwell and Whitlock
never spoke over the phone.

14:21.490 --> 14:23.378
They only met
in person.

14:23.430 --> 14:26.058
So every meeting ended
with a plan for the next one.

14:26.090 --> 14:27.899
Date, time, and place.

14:27.930 --> 14:30.296
The problem is they're not
meeting again until next week.

14:30.330 --> 14:32.935
We can't wait that long,
so I called Whitlock

14:32.970 --> 14:34.164
to make an appointment
to see him.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.895
That's why I'm here.

14:35.940 --> 14:37.100
To ask one of you
to talk to him.

14:37.140 --> 14:38.334
He can make all this
go away.

14:38.370 --> 14:40.133
Get a subpoena
for the gun, something.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.398
Just keep my name out of it.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.249
And then?

14:44.280 --> 14:45.474
And then me and him

14:45.510 --> 14:48.274
will go back to doing
what we were doing.

14:50.150 --> 14:53.517
Bringing down SBK.

14:56.060 --> 14:59.450
Miss Watson.
Calvin Whitlock.

14:59.490 --> 15:01.458
It's nice to meet you.
Yes.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.468
Message I got said
you caught a red ball?

15:03.500 --> 15:05.627
The Riclq Morales
shooting, right?
That's right.

15:05.670 --> 15:07.535
Thing is, I don't
work Riclq's gang,

15:07.570 --> 15:09.094
Los Espectros.

15:09.140 --> 15:10.402
But I'd be happy
to sit you down

15:10.440 --> 15:11.702
with one of my
colleagues, Agent Reese.

15:11.740 --> 15:14.106
Actually, that won't
be necessary.

15:14.140 --> 15:15.539
I wasn't completely
honest when I said

15:15.580 --> 15:17.605
I wanted to talk
about Ricky.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.572
I'm here on behalf
of a mutual friend,

15:19.610 --> 15:21.111
Shinwell Johnson.

15:24.750 --> 15:27.150
Why don't we take this
to my office?

15:30.460 --> 15:32.621
I told him to be
careful with that gun.

15:34.630 --> 15:37.428
Truth is, I was
more worried about you.

15:37.470 --> 15:38.562
Me?

15:38.600 --> 15:40.693
Yeah.

15:40.740 --> 15:43.629
I knew he was
spending time with you.

15:43.670 --> 15:45.638
I figured once SBK found out
he had made friends

15:45.670 --> 15:46.705
with a consultant

15:46.740 --> 15:49.573
for the NYPD...

15:49.610 --> 15:51.601
(sighs)
Look, how certain are we

15:51.650 --> 15:53.447
that these prints are
gonna turn up?

15:53.480 --> 15:54.674
He was running when
he threw the gun away.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.142
His hands were sweaty.

16:07.060 --> 16:08.618
If the cops trace
that gun back to Shinwell,

16:08.660 --> 16:10.491
he's gonna have to
face the consequences.

16:10.530 --> 16:12.691
What are you talking about?
He's your informant.

16:12.730 --> 16:14.539
A couple of years ago,

16:14.570 --> 16:17.505
I recruited another
informant, bad guy.

16:17.540 --> 16:18.666
Pulled him over
one night, he had

16:18.710 --> 16:20.575
two assault rifles
in his trunk.

16:20.610 --> 16:22.635
And like Shinwell,
he was on parole,

16:22.680 --> 16:24.079
so we cut a deal.

16:24.110 --> 16:25.998
If he kept me up
to speed on his gang,

16:26.050 --> 16:28.314
he didn't have to
go back to prison.

16:28.350 --> 16:31.080
Well, about a year later I find
out this guy was playing me.

16:34.820 --> 16:38.529
People were dying because
he and his homies would...

16:38.560 --> 16:40.699
(sighs)

16:40.730 --> 16:44.518
So I paid him a visit,
put him in the hospital.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.060
Then he got another deal,

16:46.100 --> 16:47.795
this time from my bosses.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.400
If he kept quiet
about what I did,

16:50.440 --> 16:51.759
then they would cut him loose.

16:54.110 --> 16:56.169
But there was a catch.

16:56.210 --> 16:57.541
I was stripped
of my authorization

16:57.580 --> 16:59.207
to recruit informants.

16:59.250 --> 17:01.377
Are you telling me that
you recruited Shinwell,

17:01.420 --> 17:02.546
but you never registered him?

17:02.580 --> 17:04.741
SBK is one of
the deadliest gangs

17:04.790 --> 17:06.246
in all of New York City.

17:06.290 --> 17:07.609
They have a body count
in the hundreds.

17:07.660 --> 17:08.809
I did what I had to do.

17:08.860 --> 17:11.624
You can't do this.
You have to help him.

17:11.660 --> 17:14.629
I'm sorry, but I don't.

17:14.660 --> 17:17.299
Any information
that he gathered,

17:17.330 --> 17:20.595
anything he did for me was
completely off the books.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.267
He can shout my name
from the rooftops,

17:22.300 --> 17:23.506
won't help him.

17:23.540 --> 17:25.098
If you don't do something,

17:25.140 --> 17:26.732
he's gonna be
sent back to prison.

17:26.770 --> 17:28.601
That's a shame.

17:28.640 --> 17:31.746
Yeah, it is,
'cause I like the guy.

17:31.780 --> 17:35.318
But I'm not gonna throw
away my career for him.

17:35.350 --> 17:37.511
You tell S_hinwel|
he's on his own.

17:46.230 --> 17:49.654
No, this is some bull. Whitlock
wanna play me like that?

17:49.700 --> 17:50.826
I'm gonna go
and talk to him.

17:50.870 --> 17:53.532
Make it real clear
that we know each other.

17:53.570 --> 17:56.391
Can you prove a connection
between the two of you?

17:56.440 --> 17:57.600
Then you'll probably
just be arrested.

17:57.640 --> 17:59.301
I'm gonna get arrested
if I don't go.

17:59.340 --> 18:00.739
At least that way
I get to beat his ass.

18:03.210 --> 18:04.700
I ain't gonna let him
do this to me.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.638
Not after all
I been through.

18:06.680 --> 18:08.648
Not after all the work
I've done!

18:11.920 --> 18:13.717
I was just starting
to get it right this time.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.455
I know you were.

18:18.330 --> 18:19.683
How could he do this to me?

18:19.730 --> 18:21.254
With great ease,
I imagine.

18:21.300 --> 18:22.756
On paper, you're
utterly disposable.

18:22.800 --> 18:25.621
You're an ex-con,
you're penniless, sullied,

18:25.670 --> 18:27.137
disenfranchised.

18:29.640 --> 18:30.834
Okay.

18:33.180 --> 18:36.172
You tell me, what do I do?

18:36.210 --> 18:38.144
You have two problems.
The first is that

18:38.180 --> 18:39.772
your prints were left
on a weapon

18:39.810 --> 18:41.641
which was discarded
at the scene of a shooting.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.648
Second is that once
those prints are analyzed,

18:43.690 --> 18:45.442
you'll become a suspect
in that shooting.

18:45.490 --> 18:46.787
Thanks to Agent Whitlock,

18:46.820 --> 18:48.253
there's currently
very little to be done

18:48.290 --> 18:49.587
about problem one.

18:49.620 --> 18:50.655
Problem two,
on the other hand...

18:50.690 --> 18:52.521
You didn't kill Ricky Morales.

18:52.560 --> 18:53.754
We just have to find
the person who did.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.654
Oh, that's all?

18:55.700 --> 18:57.429
Well, respectfully,
it's as mundane a task

18:57.470 --> 18:59.495
as Watson and I have
ever faced as detectives.

18:59.530 --> 19:03.500
And thanks to a lab only
recently cleared of asbestos,

19:03.540 --> 19:05.201
we now have 60-something hours
to accomplish it,

19:05.240 --> 19:07.572
which is probably 50-something
more than we'll need.

19:07.610 --> 19:09.202
Riclq Morales was
a gangster.

19:09.240 --> 19:11.743
Who kills gangsters?
Other gangsters.

19:11.780 --> 19:13.771
Riclq was shot
in SBK territory.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.378
I already told you...

19:15.420 --> 19:16.478
You don't believe
they're responSIble.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.283
I think that there's
a good chance that you're right.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.584
Ask yourself, who would
go out of their way

19:20.620 --> 19:21.814
to murder a member
of Los Espectros

19:21.860 --> 19:25.182
on a hated rival's turf?

19:25.230 --> 19:27.448
More specifically,
who could get them there

19:27.500 --> 19:29.593
without any sign
of a struggle?

19:29.630 --> 19:31.860
Another member
of Los Espectros.

19:31.900 --> 19:33.561
You think they tried
to frame SBK?

19:33.600 --> 19:35.898
As you pointed out,
it would bring SBK

19:35.940 --> 19:38.204
lots of unwanted attention
from the police.

19:38.240 --> 19:39.764
Could be.

19:39.810 --> 19:43.200
Could be, also, somebody
in Los Espectros

19:43.250 --> 19:45.878
wanting to start a war with SBK.

19:45.910 --> 19:47.878
By making it look like
we killed Ricky,

19:47.920 --> 19:49.319
it could force the issue.

19:49.350 --> 19:51.716
Either way, I think
Los Espectros is

19:51.750 --> 19:53.957
the next gang that
we should look at, don't you?

19:53.990 --> 19:55.753
I'll go down to the precinct.

19:55.790 --> 19:56.859
I'll dig up what I can on them.

19:56.890 --> 19:58.755
I'll turn my attention to Ricky.

19:58.790 --> 20:00.655
If he was lured to that
vacant lot by someone,

20:00.700 --> 20:01.894
they might have left a trail.

20:01.930 --> 20:03.568
What about me?

20:03.600 --> 20:04.794
All due respect,

20:04.830 --> 20:07.390
but I don't want
to just sit here.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.590
Not when it's my life
on the line.

20:12.470 --> 20:14.677
How can I help?

20:14.710 --> 20:17.577
You're nervous.
No.

20:17.610 --> 20:20.272
Yes, you are.
Don't be.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.776
Tell me, how am I
not gonna be nervous

20:21.820 --> 20:23.481
when you just
broke in this car?

20:23.520 --> 20:24.919
It's the best view
of the apartment

20:24.950 --> 20:27.612
that Riclq Morales
shared with his girlfriend.

20:27.660 --> 20:31.824
Also, it smells
like fresh bread.

20:33.460 --> 20:36.520
Fresh artisanal bread.

20:38.970 --> 20:40.938
There's residue
on the steering wheel.

20:40.970 --> 20:42.597
There's traces
of flour and yeast.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.801
The owner of this car
is a baker.

20:44.840 --> 20:46.933
They work at night.

20:46.970 --> 20:48.801
The engine was still warm
when we arrived.

20:48.840 --> 20:50.273
Our baker got home
a short while ago,

20:50.310 --> 20:53.347
presumably
to sleep, so...

20:53.380 --> 20:55.848
the chances of us being
discovered are slim.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.882
You think?

20:57.920 --> 20:59.911
Yesterday you outran
two police officers.

20:59.950 --> 21:03.329
You really can't escape
one sleepy baker?

21:03.360 --> 21:04.782
So we wait for the girlfriend
to leave the apartment,

21:04.830 --> 21:07.958
and then what, hmm,
we break in there, too?

21:08.000 --> 21:10.025
Mm-hmm.
I didn't think

21:10.060 --> 21:11.459
proving my innocence
of one crime

21:11.500 --> 21:13.593
would lead to
a bunch of others.

21:13.640 --> 21:14.959
Can't make an omelet.

21:18.940 --> 21:21.807
So why'd you do it?
Do what?

21:21.840 --> 21:23.944
Start working
for Agent Whitlock?

21:23.980 --> 21:25.572
Once upon a time, SBK

21:25.610 --> 21:27.578
were your family.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.076
You went to prison for them.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.940
And then, ten years later,

21:30.990 --> 21:32.912
he offers you nothing more
than a vague opportunity

21:32.950 --> 21:34.986
to do some good.

21:35.020 --> 21:36.658
And you accept.

21:36.690 --> 21:38.089
Why?

21:38.130 --> 21:40.428
Prison changed me.

21:40.460 --> 21:43.497
Yeah, I'm familiar with
the concept of change.

21:43.530 --> 21:45.020
I mean, you didn'tjust...

21:45.070 --> 21:48.039
walk away from your old life.

21:48.070 --> 21:49.958
You ran at it full-bore.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.867
Intent, as far as I can
tell, on destroying it.

21:52.910 --> 21:55.834
Ten years ago,
after I got popped,

21:55.880 --> 21:57.609
the DA. offered me a deal.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.107
Go back to SBK, wear a wire,
get them something good,

22:00.150 --> 22:02.948
and they'd cut my time in half.

22:02.980 --> 22:06.416
I told them what they can do
with that wire.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.987
It's just like you said.

22:09.020 --> 22:11.352
SBK was my family,
they brought me in,

22:11.390 --> 22:13.858
got me stuff I couldn't
get on my own.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.891
Pretty soon after that,
I was doing that for other guys.

22:15.930 --> 22:17.921
I brought them in,

22:17.970 --> 22:20.837
taught them what
they needed to know.

22:20.870 --> 22:23.509
And then I got locked up.

22:23.540 --> 22:26.907
It wasn't long before
some of the guys I brought in

22:26.940 --> 22:28.578
were doing time
right next to me.

22:28.610 --> 22:30.077
And hen the guys they
brought in.

22:30.110 --> 22:32.408
And then the guys
those guys brought in.

22:32.450 --> 22:35.010
And then it hit me.

22:35.050 --> 22:37.041
SBK didn't care.

22:38.820 --> 22:41.709
It's just like
what you said before.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.455
We were all disposable.

22:45.060 --> 22:47.927
But we're not.

22:57.440 --> 23:00.068
It's time to go.

23:01.210 --> 23:02.939
SHINWELL:
What, exactly,

23:02.980 --> 23:04.709
are we looking for?

23:04.750 --> 23:06.172
Our current theory is
that Riclq was betrayed

23:06.210 --> 23:09.941
by a member of his own gang.

23:09.980 --> 23:12.619
We need to try and identify
someone specific.

23:12.650 --> 23:14.686
Mm.

23:19.060 --> 23:20.994
Yo, over here.

23:21.030 --> 23:23.828
It says,
"Midnight betrayed by Gustavo."

23:23.870 --> 23:25.622
That's a clue, right?

23:25.670 --> 23:27.467
Is that the kind of intelligence

23:27.500 --> 23:28.933
you would give to
Agent Whitlock?

23:28.970 --> 23:31.666
I don't know why
he never registered you.

23:48.790 --> 23:50.883
Riclq or his girl's into benzos.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.682
Well, these were his.

23:52.730 --> 23:56.097
And they're not recreational,
there's a prescription.

23:56.130 --> 23:57.927
"MO," Morales.

24:03.740 --> 24:07.039
"ZX, 8:00 am."

24:07.070 --> 24:10.039
That "X" is where the
doctor's name's supposed to be.

24:17.850 --> 24:19.647
So we have a prescription
for clonazepam,

24:19.690 --> 24:21.851
and we have a regular
appointment with a doctor,

24:21.890 --> 24:23.482
if that's the "X."

24:23.530 --> 24:24.679
Perhaps our dead gangster

24:24.730 --> 24:27.153
was in therapy.

24:34.800 --> 24:35.994
Wait till you get to May.

24:36.040 --> 24:37.803
Detective Cosa.

24:37.840 --> 24:39.535
What are you doing here?

24:39.570 --> 24:40.935
I thought I'd take advantage
of your partner's offer

24:40.980 --> 24:42.004
to help with the Morales murder.

24:42.040 --> 24:43.678
Of course, what can we do?

24:43.710 --> 24:45.177
Well, actually,
you already did it.

24:45.210 --> 24:46.939
I just got out of a meeting
with your captain,

24:46.980 --> 24:48.845
told me you guys came down
to my scene this morning

24:48.880 --> 24:50.142
'cause you were bored.

24:50.180 --> 24:51.784
(chuckles)
He didn't seem too surprised.

24:51.820 --> 24:53.185
I don't understand.

24:53.220 --> 24:54.687
Were you asking him
to assign the case

24:54.720 --> 24:56.051
to someone in the squad?

24:56.090 --> 24:57.284
No, I just asked him
to fast-track

24:57.320 --> 24:59.151
the .38
for fingerprint analysis.

24:59.190 --> 25:01.055
He made a call and, boom.

25:01.100 --> 25:02.852
Lab said they'd
have it tomorrow.

25:02.900 --> 25:04.697
So, thanks, I guess.

25:04.730 --> 25:06.027
For being bored.

25:06.070 --> 25:08.061
(soft chuckle)
You're welcome.

25:14.780 --> 25:17.101
HOLMES:
So you don't deny
knowing Ricky Morales?

25:17.140 --> 25:19.802
No, nor do I
confirm knowing him.

25:19.850 --> 25:21.977
Dr. Xanthopoulos,
are you aware you are the only

25:22.020 --> 25:24.045
medical professional
in the entire tri-state area

25:24.090 --> 25:25.785
with the initials "Z.X.?"

25:25.820 --> 25:27.754
Bully for me.

25:27.790 --> 25:29.883
Riclq Morales had a regular
appointment with a Z.X.;

25:29.920 --> 25:32.059
_ he also had a
prescription for clonazepam.

25:32.090 --> 25:34.558
I'm not saying I was his
therapist, but if I was,

25:34.600 --> 25:35.794
doctor-patient confidentiality

25:35.830 --> 25:38.128
would prevent me from sharing

25:38.170 --> 25:40.092
any of the details
of his treatment.
SHINWELL: He's dead.

25:40.130 --> 25:41.791
I'm pretty sure he won't sue.

25:41.840 --> 25:43.967
My 1:00 will be here soon,

25:44.010 --> 25:45.807
so if you don't mind...
In all of my years

25:45.840 --> 25:48.809
as a detective, I have yet to
find a criminal organization

25:48.840 --> 25:51.070
that appreciates its members
seeing a psychiatrist.

25:51.110 --> 25:53.817
There's just too many...
secrets at risk.

25:53.850 --> 25:56.273
So what if Ricky was killed
by someone in Los Espectros

25:56.320 --> 25:58.948
who discovered he'd been
spending time on your couch?

25:58.990 --> 26:00.139
It might not be long

26:00.190 --> 26:02.181
before you're paid a visit.

26:02.220 --> 26:05.121
Is that what you think happened?

26:05.160 --> 26:07.151
I'm not saying I do,
but ifI did,

26:07.190 --> 26:09.226
it would behoove you to tell us
everything that you know

26:09.260 --> 26:10.818
about Ricky and his friends.

26:10.870 --> 26:12.292
Would it not?

26:14.100 --> 26:16.239
Despite his background,
Riclq was a very sensitive

26:16.270 --> 26:17.294
young man.

26:17.340 --> 26:18.762
He started coming to see me

26:18.810 --> 26:21.608
six months ago.

26:21.640 --> 26:23.232
Accelerated heart rate,

26:23.280 --> 26:24.941
dizziness,
shortness of breath.

26:24.980 --> 26:26.868
He was having panic attacks.

26:26.910 --> 26:28.616
That's what the
clonazepam was for.

26:28.650 --> 26:30.208
What made him so scared?

26:30.250 --> 26:32.241
Was he worried about somebody
in Los Espectros?

26:32.290 --> 26:35.259
Actually, he was worried about
everyone in Los Espectros.

26:35.290 --> 26:37.212
A few months before
he started seeing me,

26:37.260 --> 26:38.852
he got caught with
a kilo of heroin

26:40.730 --> 26:42.254
In order to avoid prosecution,

26:42.300 --> 26:44.120
he agreed to become
an informant.

26:44.170 --> 26:46.968
He was ratting on his gang.

26:49.740 --> 26:51.935
Did he think anyone in
particular had caught on to him?

26:51.970 --> 26:55.770
He didn't. And, in a way, that
was the root of his anxiety.

26:55.810 --> 26:57.869
He wasn't having panic attacks
because he was afraid

26:57.910 --> 27:01.073
for his life, he was having them
because he felt guilty.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.782
He was betraying
the people that he loved.

27:03.820 --> 27:06.243
He tried talking about it to
the agent who recruited him,

27:06.290 --> 27:07.689
Whitlock,

27:07.720 --> 27:08.812
but he didn't care.

27:08.860 --> 27:10.179
Calvin Whitlock?

27:10.220 --> 27:12.154
Yeah, he's an FBI agent.

27:12.190 --> 27:13.282
Do you know him?

27:13.330 --> 27:15.821
HOLMES:
As a matter of fact, we do.

27:23.070 --> 27:25.163
(printer whirring)

27:27.040 --> 27:29.372
Didn't you get my message?

27:29.410 --> 27:30.843
I got it.

27:30.880 --> 27:32.177
Did you read it?
I specifically

27:32.210 --> 27:34.349
asked for anything
other than pizza.

27:34.380 --> 27:36.678
Well, you never responded
to my text either.

27:36.720 --> 27:38.347
"Saw Cosa at the precinct.

27:38.390 --> 27:40.278
Gregson fast-tracking
print analysis."

27:40.320 --> 27:42.356
If we don't solve
Riclq Morales' murder

27:42.390 --> 27:44.756
before the police identify
Shinwell's prints...

27:44.790 --> 27:47.054
You don't need to worry
about us not solving it.

27:47.090 --> 27:48.853
We have maybe 12 hours.
You're that confident?

27:48.900 --> 27:52.199
I am. I already know
who killed Riclq Morales.

27:52.230 --> 27:54.937
Agent Calvin Whitlock
of the FBI.

27:56.970 --> 27:59.063
SHINWELL:
I don't see a lot of proof.

27:59.110 --> 28:01.328
Don't get me wrong,
I like your little...

28:01.380 --> 28:03.234
art project.
Can't be a coincidence

28:03.280 --> 28:05.942
that Riclq
was in Whitlock's employ.

28:05.980 --> 28:08.141
During World War II,
Whitlock's grandfather served

28:08.180 --> 28:09.738
in the Pacific.
He would easily have

28:09.780 --> 28:12.840
picked up a Nambu pistol
off a Japanese soldier.

28:12.890 --> 28:14.778
Why kill Ricky with
a family heirloom?
'Cause it
wouldn't be registered.

28:14.820 --> 28:16.811
You couldn't prove
it belonged to Whitlock.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.759
Tell her_about_
his surprise Vi5it

28:19.790 --> 28:21.451
to your apartment.

28:21.500 --> 28:24.298
A few weeks back,
he let himself in.

28:24.330 --> 28:26.025
I came through the door,
and all of a sudden,

28:26.070 --> 28:27.867
there was a gun
to the back of my head.

28:27.900 --> 28:29.299
His way of telling me

28:29.340 --> 28:30.807
to do a better job
of hiding the .38

28:30.840 --> 28:33.161
I got from Tall Boy.
What's his motive?

28:33.210 --> 28:35.235
HOLMES: Perhaps he wanted
out of the arrangement.

28:35.280 --> 28:37.271
Perhaps he threatened
to expose Whitlock.

28:37.310 --> 28:40.302
If it wasn't Whitlock,
got to be Los Espectros.

28:40.350 --> 28:42.272
I mean, they found out
he was a snitch

28:42.320 --> 28:44.447
and capped him.
Well, that doesn't make
any sense either.

28:44.490 --> 28:46.310
I've been reading
about them all day.

28:46.350 --> 28:48.181
They torture traitors
before they kill them,

28:48.220 --> 28:50.256
and they always do it
on their own turf.

28:50.290 --> 28:52.121
They want other members
to see what happens

28:52.160 --> 28:53.991
when someone double-crosses
the gang.

28:54.030 --> 28:55.998
Riclq died quick and painless.

28:56.030 --> 28:58.362
And nowhere near
Los Espectros territory.
Well, maybe

28:58.400 --> 28:59.958
it's like what I said before.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.195
That they wanted to frame SBK.

29:02.240 --> 29:05.129
Honestly, I don't think
they would've risked it.

29:05.170 --> 29:07.775
I mean, getting caught
could've kicked off a war,

29:07.810 --> 29:09.300
and they can't afford
that right now.

29:09.340 --> 29:10.432
Membership on the decline,
is it?

29:10.480 --> 29:12.903
More like under attack.
There was a robbery last month.

29:12.950 --> 29:15.373
Los Espectros got hit when
they were handing money over

29:15.420 --> 29:17.308
to their money launderer.
I heard about that.

29:17.350 --> 29:19.215
A lot of their boys got shot.

29:19.250 --> 29:21.810
And the crew that took 'em
down made off with six figures.

29:21.860 --> 29:24.055
Yeah. They're too busy licking
their wounds right now

29:24.090 --> 29:25.455
to pick a fight with anyone.

29:25.490 --> 29:28.288
So, allow me to resubmit
the obvious candidate:

29:28.330 --> 29:30.423
Agent Whitlock.

29:30.460 --> 29:33.327
Okay. Same question.
Why do it in SBK territory?

29:33.370 --> 29:34.792
He could've killed Riclq
anywhere.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.398
Instead, he chooses a vacant lot
(phone chimes)

29:36.440 --> 29:39.034
where the shots can be heard.
How is that a smart plan?

29:40.040 --> 29:41.803
I got to go.

29:41.840 --> 29:43.899
Something more pressing than
your imminent murder charge?

29:43.950 --> 29:47.044
Tall Boy want to see me.

29:52.450 --> 29:54.850
Why would you go
see him right now?

29:54.890 --> 29:57.358
Do I have a choice?
Of course _
you have a ch0ice.

29:57.390 --> 29:59.153
You only got involved
with SBK again

29:59.190 --> 30:00.999
to help bring them down.
That is over.

30:01.030 --> 30:02.497
If I don't go,
there might be consequences.

30:02.530 --> 30:04.361
There might be consequences
if you do go.

30:04.400 --> 30:07.494
Look, Tall Boy knows
you dropped that .38.

30:07.530 --> 30:09.191
Just like he knows your prints
are in the system.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.504
As far as SBK is concerned,
you might be a loose end.

30:11.540 --> 30:13.428
When I got sent up ten years
ago, I didn't flip on nobody.

30:13.470 --> 30:15.176
Why would they think
I'd start now?

30:15.210 --> 30:17.599
Say Sherlock is right.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.471
There's an FBI agent out there

30:19.510 --> 30:22.308
who doesn't want it getting out
that he uses CIs off the books,

30:22.350 --> 30:24.341
and he's willing to kill
to keep it quiet.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.346
He doesn't have to do
his own dirty work.

30:26.390 --> 30:27.857
He just has to tell your friends

30:27.890 --> 30:29.209
that you're an informant.

30:30.360 --> 30:31.486
You know this could be a trap.

30:31.530 --> 30:33.054
They know about Chivonne.

30:33.090 --> 30:35.149
They know about my daughter.

30:35.200 --> 30:37.998
If they can't find me,
they might go looking for her.

30:38.030 --> 30:40.863
And I'm not gonna
let that happen.

30:44.410 --> 30:46.560
(rap music playing indistinctly)

30:49.210 --> 30:51.178
Yo. Shin.

30:51.210 --> 30:53.144
Tall Boy ain't up there.

30:53.180 --> 30:55.546
Where he at?

31:20.140 --> 31:21.402
Big Mike.

31:21.440 --> 31:23.476
Word up.
Shin.

31:23.510 --> 31:25.569
We been lookin' for you.

31:25.610 --> 31:28.579
Been laying low.

31:28.620 --> 31:31.180
You?

31:31.220 --> 31:33.415
That craziness last night?
I got out there clean.

31:33.450 --> 31:36.317
Wish I could say
the same for you.

31:36.360 --> 31:38.089
Not too smart, Shin.

31:38.130 --> 31:39.586
Chucking your gun like that.

31:39.630 --> 31:41.518
Wouldn't have if I'd known
I was gonna get away.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.524
Ain't nothin' to
trip on, though.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.322
I've been keeping a
close watch on my place.

31:46.370 --> 31:47.997
If the police knew
the .38 was mine,

31:48.040 --> 31:49.632
they would've
been by already.

31:55.410 --> 31:57.139
Well, try to hold
on to this one.

31:57.180 --> 31:58.647
They don't grow on trees.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.568
Hey, go on. Take it.

32:02.480 --> 32:04.311
Thanks.

32:04.350 --> 32:05.942
It ain't a gift, Shin.

32:05.990 --> 32:07.548
It's a loan. You and
me got work to do.

32:07.590 --> 32:09.080
What kind of work?

32:09.120 --> 32:10.610
Serve and protect kind.

32:10.660 --> 32:12.025
15th of _the month
coming up.

32:12.060 --> 32:13.425
Time for the drop.

32:13.460 --> 32:15.621
With that dead boy next
to the Jewelry Mart,

32:15.660 --> 32:18.367
word come down it's too hot
to do business there.

32:18.400 --> 32:19.958
So, we got to bail out
to the backup spot.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.558
Check-cashing place on Greely?

32:21.600 --> 32:23.295
Yeah, it'll be all right,

32:23.340 --> 32:25.103
but it ain't locked
down like the J-Mart.

32:25.140 --> 32:27.131
We get caught, we
got to come ready.

32:28.540 --> 32:30.599
(chuckling):
Yo, Shin.

32:31.580 --> 32:33.138
We cool?

32:34.180 --> 32:36.740
Yeah, we cool.

32:36.780 --> 32:37.747
WATSON :
You okay?

32:37.780 --> 32:39.486
Good. Really good, actually.

32:39.520 --> 32:40.589
Your partner's right.

32:40.620 --> 32:42.451
Whitlock killed Riclq.

32:42.490 --> 32:45.482
And I know why he did it
in SBK territory.

32:47.590 --> 32:48.591
(scanner beeps)

32:49.600 --> 32:52.626
Agent Whitlock, we need
to talk about Shinwell.

32:52.670 --> 32:55.468
I don't know that name.

32:55.500 --> 32:58.003
You're worried I'm recording
this conversation.

32:58.040 --> 32:59.701
I'm not.

32:59.740 --> 33:01.139
If it'll make you
feel better,

33:01.180 --> 33:02.602
I can do most
of the talking.

33:02.640 --> 33:05.200
You lied when you said
that you keep your informants

33:05.250 --> 33:07.548
off the books because of
some disciplinary action.

33:07.580 --> 33:10.515
You had to, because
you're not gathering intel

33:10.550 --> 33:11.619
to bring the gangs down,

33:11.650 --> 33:14.517
you're gathering intel
to rip them off.

33:14.560 --> 33:15.652
You use your CIs to find out

33:15.690 --> 33:17.317
when the gangs move their money.

33:17.360 --> 33:18.520
And then you ambush them

33:18.560 --> 33:20.118
and then you rob them blind.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.520
Follow me.

33:33.710 --> 33:35.234
You know, it's funny.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.702
I heard your partner was the one
who did too many drugs.

33:38.580 --> 33:40.343
Shinwell said you
pressed him hard

33:40.380 --> 33:42.041
on SBK money drops.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.719
He told you they happened
at a jewelry mart

33:44.750 --> 33:47.241
up in the Bronx, but that place
is set up like a fortress.

33:47.290 --> 33:48.518
So when there is a drop,

33:48.560 --> 33:50.414
SBK has guards and spotters

33:50.460 --> 33:52.758
at every entrance and exit.

33:52.790 --> 33:55.099
No once can get
within a thousand feet.

33:55.130 --> 33:57.553
So, Shinwell told you
there was a drop coming up.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.761
So, yesterday, you shot
and killed someone

33:59.800 --> 34:01.563
in a vacant lot next door.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.591
You knew_ that with
police crawling all over,

34:03.640 --> 34:06.803
SBK would have to find a new
and less secure location.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.535
Then, you get the details
from Shinwell,

34:08.580 --> 34:11.504
and then you and your team
would swing into action.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.177
I have a team now?

34:13.210 --> 34:15.474
Four gangs have been robbed.

34:15.520 --> 34:17.545
The assailants have_
been the same every time.

34:17.580 --> 34:18.615
Three masked men,

34:18.650 --> 34:20.709
heavily armed
and armored.

34:20.750 --> 34:22.684
Their last target
was Los Espectros.

34:22.720 --> 34:25.655
Now, Los Espectros
thought it was a rival gang,

34:25.690 --> 34:28.352
but it wasn't; it was you
and two of your friends.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.460
You knew when and where
to strike,

34:31.500 --> 34:34.298
thanks to your inside man,
Riclq Morales.

34:34.340 --> 34:35.762
Never heard of him,
but this is fun.

34:35.800 --> 34:37.336
Keep going.

34:37.370 --> 34:40.533
You left a wounded
gang member behind.

34:40.570 --> 34:42.572
He told police that
one of your guys

34:42.610 --> 34:43.872
took a bullet
in the arm.

34:43.910 --> 34:45.673
So they checked local hospitals

34:45.710 --> 34:47.473
for people who were treated
for gunshot wounds.

34:47.510 --> 34:49.819
They didn't find any,
but my partner and I

34:49.850 --> 34:52.387
cast a wider net.

34:57.520 --> 34:58.748
Lionel Trafoya,

34:58.790 --> 34:59.882
was treated for
an arm wound

34:59.930 --> 35:01.693
in Northern New Jersey.

35:01.730 --> 35:03.857
Says here he was mugged.

35:03.900 --> 35:05.822
That was his story.

35:07.600 --> 35:09.488
Now, I'm pretty sure
his DNA is gonna be a match

35:09.540 --> 35:11.667
for the blood found
at the scene of the robbery.

35:11.710 --> 35:14.702
Now, Trafoya used to
work here, with you.

35:14.740 --> 35:17.800
He resigned in 2013--
something about, uh,

35:17.840 --> 35:20.673
evidence going missing
at a narcotics raid.

35:22.320 --> 35:25.187
He's talking to
a Detective Cosa right now.

35:25.220 --> 35:27.142
He might not give you up,

35:27.190 --> 35:28.612
but then again,

35:28.660 --> 35:29.809
you know how easy it is

35:29.860 --> 35:32.624
for criminals to turn
on their friends.

35:34.530 --> 35:36.794
What's the out?

35:36.830 --> 35:39.469
You're telling me this
because there's an out.

35:39.500 --> 35:41.161
You want something.

35:41.200 --> 35:43.566
Cosa doesn't know
about Shinwell yet.

35:44.570 --> 35:46.299
I want you to tell her.

35:46.340 --> 35:48.831
You don't want to be the one

35:48.880 --> 35:50.677
to put him at the scene
yesterday.

35:50.710 --> 35:53.679
You want me to admit that
he's hanging with SBK again,

35:53.710 --> 35:54.779
because of me?

35:54.820 --> 35:56.845
Don't forget about the gun.

35:56.880 --> 35:59.383
He only had that because of you.

35:59.420 --> 36:01.559
Explain that and
my partner and I

36:01.590 --> 36:04.479
will do everything we can to see
that you're offered a deal

36:04.530 --> 36:07.727
that keeps you out of gen pop
when you go to prison.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.227
Given your history
with gang members,

36:10.260 --> 36:12.524
you might not want to be
locked up with any.

36:12.570 --> 36:14.731
Go to hell.

36:17.970 --> 36:20.234
For when you change your mind.

36:28.920 --> 36:31.912
(phone ringing)

36:34.990 --> 36:36.480
That didn't take long.

36:36.520 --> 36:38.420
WHITLOCK:
I'm a good agent.

36:38.460 --> 36:40.621
I want you to know that.

36:40.660 --> 36:43.788
99% of what I do, it's clean.

36:43.830 --> 36:47.220
I put bad guys away,
I keep people safe.

36:47.270 --> 36:50.330
Except for the ones
you rob and murder.

36:50.370 --> 36:52.509
Look, it...

36:53.510 --> 36:55.432
...it started off small.

36:55.480 --> 36:57.801
You know, just
taking a little bit off the top,

36:57.840 --> 36:59.444
stealing from criminals.

36:59.480 --> 37:01.243
How is that even wrong?

37:01.280 --> 37:02.611
Then I got in deeper

37:02.650 --> 37:03.878
and deeper.

37:05.850 --> 37:08.785
I've spent years
looking over my shoulder,

37:08.820 --> 37:11.254
waiting for this thing
to come home.

37:11.290 --> 37:13.724
Now, it's over.

37:13.760 --> 37:15.022
So, in a way, you--

37:15.060 --> 37:16.755
you did me a favor.

37:16.800 --> 37:18.961
So now, I'm gonna
do you a favor.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.729
So what, you're gonna
talk to the police?

37:20.770 --> 37:22.761
No. No.

37:22.800 --> 37:23.835
I won't.

37:23.870 --> 37:26.509
That's the favor.

37:26.540 --> 37:27.734
You got Shinwell wrong.

37:27.770 --> 37:29.408
You see, he's...

37:29.440 --> 37:30.702
he's a banger.

37:30.740 --> 37:33.379
Bangers are bangers for life.

37:33.410 --> 37:35.617
He'll be better off
when he goes back to prison.

37:37.720 --> 37:39.449
Yes, he is.

37:40.920 --> 37:43.980
When those prints come back
from the .38,

37:44.020 --> 37:45.920
that'll be that.

37:45.960 --> 37:48.895
You want the gun
that killed Ricky?

37:48.930 --> 37:50.898
It's all yours.

37:50.930 --> 37:54.934
You just have to
come by my office and get it.

37:54.970 --> 37:56.858
(gunshot)

37:57.900 --> 37:59.458
Agent Whitlock?

38:12.090 --> 38:14.354
If it wasn't for bad luck, huh?

38:14.390 --> 38:16.608
I'm sorry.

38:16.660 --> 38:18.628
HOLMES: What about
Whitlock's accomplice?

38:18.660 --> 38:21.629
Lionel Trafoya, surely
he was aware that Whitlock

38:21.660 --> 38:23.651
was recruiting informants
under false pretenses.

38:23.700 --> 38:25.463
WATSON:
IfI had to guess,

38:25.500 --> 38:26.899
I'd say he was, but

38:26.930 --> 38:28.932
Detective Cosa called
a little while ago, she said

38:28.970 --> 38:30.528
she couldn't get him to
talk, he lawyered up.

38:30.570 --> 38:31.730
There was a third member
of the team

38:31.770 --> 38:32.907
Whitlock assembled
to rob street gangs.

38:32.940 --> 38:34.476
SHINWELL:
If he's smart,

38:34.510 --> 38:36.102
he's on his way out of
the country by now.

38:36.140 --> 38:37.471
That's quitter's talk.

38:37.510 --> 38:39.808
No, reality.

38:39.850 --> 38:42.671
You did what you could
and I'm grateful,

38:42.720 --> 38:43.948
but it's over.

38:43.980 --> 38:45.641
If Whitlock was
telling the truth

38:45.690 --> 38:46.941
about the gun he used
to kill himself,

38:46.990 --> 38:48.514
then the bullets
would be a match

38:48.560 --> 38:49.788
for the ones
that killed Ricky Morales.

38:49.820 --> 38:50.912
That takes care of that.

38:50.960 --> 38:52.780
But the .38 is still out there.

38:52.830 --> 38:53.785
If it gets traced back to you...

38:53.830 --> 38:54.649
If?

38:54.700 --> 38:56.691
Come on, the prints
are there, Doc.

38:56.730 --> 38:58.561
I'm as good as violated.

38:58.600 --> 39:00.522
We'll both be in your corner.

39:00.570 --> 39:01.366
And we'll get you
the best lawyer we can.

39:01.400 --> 39:02.697
All due respect, I don't

39:02.740 --> 39:03.866
want to get into all that
right now.

39:03.900 --> 39:05.868
What do you want to do?

39:05.910 --> 39:07.434
The way I see it,
I got one day

39:07.470 --> 39:08.698
before I have to
go back to prison.

39:08.740 --> 39:11.106
Maybe less.

39:11.140 --> 39:13.108
I want to make the most of it.

39:24.160 --> 39:25.718
What the hell are
you domg, man?

39:25.760 --> 39:26.852
Sorry, I was, uh--

39:26.890 --> 39:28.448
I was reviewing the, um,

39:28.500 --> 39:29.853
cases you've been assigned
since I was away,

39:29.900 --> 39:31.424
I've been away
for 48 hours.

39:31.470 --> 39:32.664
Hadn't you noticed?

39:32.700 --> 39:34.122
Matter of fact,
I did notice.

39:34.170 --> 39:35.694
We all did, it was
a scary time.

39:35.740 --> 39:37.093
We weren't sure we could

39:37.140 --> 39:38.801
keep this whole "law and
order" thing going,

39:38.840 --> 39:40.603
but you're back
now, thank God.

39:40.640 --> 39:41.834
Since when is a stolen pet

39:41.880 --> 39:43.029
a major case?

39:43.080 --> 39:44.843
Since its owner _is a
close personal friend

39:44.880 --> 39:46.768
of the mayor's,
that's when.
(chuckling)

39:46.810 --> 39:47.799
Do you mind?

39:47.850 --> 39:49.875
Sorry.

39:49.920 --> 39:52.047
I was hoping to
find a distraction.

39:52.090 --> 39:55.059
(scoffs) Did you say
"find" or "cause"?

39:55.090 --> 39:57.479
Your brother, Andre,

39:57.520 --> 39:58.919
he's an ex-con, right?

39:58.960 --> 40:01.121
What's that have to do
with anything?

40:01.160 --> 40:02.855
So, from what I understand,

40:02.900 --> 40:04.595
he's been doing very well
since he got out, right?

40:04.630 --> 40:06.621
He's staying on the
straight and narrow, yes?

40:06.670 --> 40:08.695
He's got a job,
his own place,

40:08.740 --> 40:10.765
yeah, he's doing good. Why?

40:10.800 --> 40:12.802
What do you think would happen
if he went back to prison?

40:12.840 --> 40:14.000
(scoffs)

40:14.040 --> 40:16.099
I think my mom's heart
would break.

40:16.140 --> 40:17.869
No, what if he went back

40:17.910 --> 40:19.673
not because he_
committed a new crime,

40:19.710 --> 40:21.007
but because of a mistake?

40:21.050 --> 40:23.177
Because of a technicality?

40:23.220 --> 40:25.188
Do you think
all of his hard work

40:25.220 --> 40:27.541
would be for nothing?

40:34.560 --> 40:37.097
In about ten seconds.

40:37.130 --> 40:39.166
You want to tell me
why you're asking?

40:40.800 --> 40:42.893
HOLMES: This is you
making the most

40:42.940 --> 40:44.430
of your last day, is it?

40:49.510 --> 40:52.047
Miss Raquel lives
just underneath,

40:52.080 --> 40:53.672
82-years-old.

40:53.710 --> 40:54.972
She told me a couple days ago

40:55.020 --> 40:57.978
she had a leak in her ceiling.

40:58.020 --> 40:59.681
I didn't feel right
going to prison

40:59.720 --> 41:01.859
without fixing it.

41:03.990 --> 41:05.878
Got your tools back, I see.

41:05.930 --> 41:07.921
Yep.

41:07.960 --> 41:11.919
Man at the pawnshop
didn't even charge me interest.

41:11.970 --> 41:14.268
Maybe my luck
is starting to change.

41:14.300 --> 41:16.632
Just got back from the lab.

41:16.670 --> 41:17.989
Your prints were
on the .38.

41:22.810 --> 41:25.802
So you came here to break
the news to me in person?

41:25.850 --> 41:28.512
Nah, I came here
to give you this.

41:28.550 --> 41:31.212
*

41:31.250 --> 41:32.945
What is it?

41:32.990 --> 41:35.788
It's the cloth I used
to wipe the gun.

41:35.820 --> 41:37.754
Hadn't been
processed yet.

41:37.790 --> 41:39.985
When it is, there won't
be any prints on it.

41:41.660 --> 41:42.888
How did you...

41:42.930 --> 41:44.522
The less you know about
that, the better.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.696
It's your second
second chance.

41:51.670 --> 41:54.002
Do make the most of it.

42:00.180 --> 42:01.977
(sighs)
