42, TYPE 1 DIABETIC.

OKAY, SEAN, UM, I KNOW
IT'S INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING--

05:55.726 --> 05:58.559
YOU DON'T KNOW. MY KIDS ARE
IN IOWA LIVING WITH MY PARENTS.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.631
OKAY, I BARELY SURVIVED
THAT HOUSE,

06:00.631 --> 06:02.693

06:04.965 --> 06:07.768

WAS SUCCESSFUL,

06:07.768 --> 06:10.801
BUT WE KNEW IT COULD BE TOUGH

06:10.801 --> 06:12.803
GETTING THE INSULIN LEVELS
ON TRACK,

06:12.803 --> 06:14.875
AND, YEAH, IT HAS BEEN TOUGH.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.548

GOOD ENOUGH ANYMORE.

06:17.548 --> 06:20.481

ABOUT HOW

06:25.916 --> 06:28.419

06:28.419 --> 06:31.121
DR. BAILEY SAID SHE WAS
PREPARED TO ROLL THE DICE,

06:31.121 --> 06:32.623
BUT SURGERY WAS A GAMBLE.

06:32.623 --> 06:34.124
CLARA ROCKED IT.

06:34.124 --> 06:38.168

SHE CAN DO ANYTHING.

NOPE. ALL DONE.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.558

OF THE PATIENTS, RIGHT?

07:07.558 --> 07:10.160

07:10.160 --> 07:12.533

07:22.513 --> 07:25.445

07:25.445 --> 07:26.877
WE'RE NOT EVEN DATING.
WE'RE NOT EVEN DATING.

07:26.877 --> 07:28.448
I'M SERIOUS. WE'RE NOT.

07:28.448 --> 07:31.021
OKAY, MAYBE I THOUGHT
WE WERE AT FIRST.

07:31.021 --> 07:33.924
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THAT NOW.
WE'RE JUST HANGING OUT.

07:33.924 --> 07:36.557

07:49.500 --> 07:52.002
(paddles thunk)
(inhales sharply)

08:02.653 --> 08:04.484
YOU HAD CHEST PAIN, SO YOU
DECIDED TO GO FOR A JOG?

08:04.484 --> 08:06.517
OW! OH.
SORRY.

08:06.517 --> 08:09.489
HOW MUCH MORPHINE
DID YOU GIVE HIM?
10.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.523
HE SHOULDN'T BE IN THIS
MUCH PAIN. GIVE HIM MORE.
SO WHAT IS THIS,
A HEART ATTACK?

08:12.523 --> 08:14.895
'CAUSE IT
SURE FEELS LIKE ONE.
I DON'T KNOW. WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO RUN SOME TESTS TO FIND OUT.

08:14.895 --> 08:17.227
AH.
A JOG?!

08:17.227 --> 08:19.900
HEY, IT'S NOT LIKE I WENT OUT
FOR A CHEESEBURGER.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.833
HER NAME IS CLARA GREEN.
NOW I KNOW IT'S PREMATURE,

08:22.833 --> 08:25.836
BUT I WAS THINKING SHE COULD BE
A CANDIDATE FOR YOUR TRIAL.

08:25.836 --> 08:28.108
LOOK, I STILL DON'T HAVE
APPROVAL FROM THE FDA, BAILEY.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.610
SIR, THESE PEOPLE
ARE DESPERATE.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.612
IF WE COULD JUST MAKE THEM
FIRST ON THE LIST

08:31.612 --> 08:33.614
TO GIVE 'EM SOMETHING
TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.616
WELL, WHY NOT JUST DO
THE SURGERY TODAY?

08:35.616 --> 08:37.618
AVERY, JUST BECAUSE A PATIENT
CALLED YOU A STUPID KID

08:37.618 --> 08:40.220
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU SHOULD ACT LIKE ONE.
SHE CAN'T EVEN TAKE
IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS

08:40.220 --> 08:42.222
WITHOUT RISKING
HER TUMOR COMING BACK.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.754
SHE'S DETERIORATING
BY THE HOUR.

08:43.754 --> 08:45.756
WHY NOT APPLY
FOR AN EMERGENCY WAIVER?

08:45.756 --> 08:47.758
BECAUSE IF SOMETHING
GOES WRONG DURING THE SURGERY,

08:47.758 --> 08:49.930
THEN IT WOULD KILL THE CHIEF'S
CHANCE FOR GETTING APPROVAL.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.232
SIR, HER KIDS
ARE STUCK IN IOWA...
DR. AVERY--

08:52.232 --> 08:54.705
WITH THEIR GRANDPARENTS,
WHO ARE MEAN, SIR.
(sighs)

08:54.705 --> 08:56.737
CHIEF, DR. ALTMAN'S
PAGING YOU.

08:56.737 --> 09:00.170
I'LL CALL THE FDA,
SEE IF WE CAN GET A WAIVER.

09:00.170 --> 09:03.173
GET THE PATIENT ON BOARD.
OKAY.

09:03.173 --> 09:06.246
(indistinct conversations)

09:06.246 --> 09:07.748
WHAT? I...

09:07.748 --> 09:10.681
(clears throat)

09:10.681 --> 09:12.022
WHERE DO YOU WANT THIS?

09:12.022 --> 09:15.325
WHAT'S THAT FOR?
SCRAPBOOK STATION.

09:15.325 --> 09:17.928
PUT IT NEXT TO THAT BOX
WITH THE GLITTER PENS.
OH, NO, NO, NO.

09:17.928 --> 09:20.260
DON'T PUT IT ANYWHERE. WE'RE
NOT HAVING A SCRAPBOOK STATION.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.763
YOU HEARD CALLIE THIS MORNING.
SHE WANTS US TO GO ALL OUT.

09:22.763 --> 09:26.036
MOVE THE TABLE.
NO, DON'T MOVE THE TABLE.

09:26.036 --> 09:29.199
MARK, THIS ISN'T A SCRAPBOOK
STATION KIND OF SHOWER.
YOU'RE WRONG. YANG, TELL HER.

09:29.199 --> 09:31.642
TORRES WANTS
ALL THE GIRLIE STUFF--

09:31.642 --> 09:33.704
GAMES, ONESIE DECORATING.

09:33.704 --> 09:35.706
I HAVE A PATIENT.
GREY?

09:35.706 --> 09:38.308
I CAN'T GET OVER THE FACT
THAT YOU KNOW

09:38.308 --> 09:41.181
WHAT ONESIE DECORATING IS.
I'VE BEEN BONING UP.

09:41.181 --> 09:44.314
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO
FOR THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE.
OH, BITE ME, MARK.

09:44.314 --> 09:47.958
OH, WHAT'S GOING ON?
ARE YOU GUYS FIGHTING AGAIN?

09:47.958 --> 09:51.221
DID YOU WANT
A SCRAPBOOK STATION?
OH, YEAH. OF COURSE.
IT'S NOT A REAL SHOWER

09:51.221 --> 09:53.293
IF YOU DON'T GET
TO TAKE HOME A SCRAPBOOK.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.595
OOH, WE SHOULD HAVE
GLITTER PENS!

09:55.595 --> 09:57.998
(siren wails)

09:57.998 --> 10:00.701
NO, YOU CAN'T. BECAUSE IF YOU
QUIT AND MOVE HERE,

10:00.701 --> 10:02.703
YOU'LL GET DEPRESSED
AND START TO HATE ME.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.705
LOOK, I HAVE TO GO.
JUST...

10:04.705 --> 10:06.807
PLEASE STOP CALLING.
GOOD-BYE.

10:06.807 --> 10:09.139
(cell phone beeps)
THEY'RE READY.
CAN YOU BRING THE CHART?

10:09.139 --> 10:12.142
SURE.
SORRY. THE BOYFRIEND THING
IS A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED

10:12.142 --> 10:14.284
THAN SHE CAN HANDLE.

10:14.284 --> 10:17.347
SO YOU TWO
ARE STILL TOGETHER OR--
NO. WHY?

10:17.347 --> 10:19.349
WELL,
WE REQUIRE THE CARETAKER

10:19.349 --> 10:22.723
TO BE A FULL-TIME RESIDENT
OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON.
I KNOW THAT.

10:22.723 --> 10:25.025
OKAY. I MEAN,
IT'S A BIG COMMITMENT.

10:25.025 --> 10:28.028
AND IT MAY NOT FEEL LIKE IT NOW,
BUT SIX MONTHS FROM NOW,

10:28.028 --> 10:30.060
A YEAR DOWN THE ROAD--
IT CAN GET OVERWHELMING.

10:30.060 --> 10:32.763
AND IF YOU THINK YOU MIGHT MOVE
BACK TO LONDON, IF THERE'S

10:32.763 --> 10:35.335
EVEN THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE,
YOU NEED TO LET US KNOW.
LOOK, WHEN I CAME OUT
TO MY FAMILY,

10:35.335 --> 10:37.337
MY MOTHER STOOD BY ME,
SHE LOVED ME.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.670
AND I KNOW THAT MAY NOT SEEM
LIKE A BIG DEAL TO YOU,

10:39.670 --> 10:42.272
BUT IN MY FAMILY, WHERE WE COME
FROM, BEING GAY ISN'T SOMETHING

10:42.272 --> 10:44.274
PEOPLE JUST COME TO ACCEPT
AFTER A WHILE.

10:44.274 --> 10:47.778
IT'S A CRIME, AND--AND PEOPLE
DIE BECAUSE OF IT.

10:47.778 --> 10:50.751
AND--AND MY FATHER REFUSED
TO DEAL WITH IT, SO HE LEFT.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.123
HE GOT A NEW WIFE,
AND MY MOM LOST EVERYTHING.

10:53.123 --> 10:57.087
THIS--THIS IS THE LEAST
I COULD DO FOR HER.

10:57.087 --> 11:00.330
I'M COMMITTED
TO THIS TRIAL, DR. GREY.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.734
OKAY.

11:03.734 --> 11:05.035
(keyboard key clicks,
computer beeps)

11:05.035 --> 11:07.037
(Miranda) NOW ISLET CELLS
PRODUCE INSULIN.

11:07.037 --> 11:10.670
WE WOULD PUT THE CELLS
IN A DEVICE IN YOUR BODY,

11:10.670 --> 11:12.672
AND IT WILL ACT LIKE
A BRAND-NEW PANCREAS.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.674
WE'RE CONTACTING THE FDA

11:14.674 --> 11:16.707
TO GET THEIR APPROVAL
RIGHT NOW.

11:16.707 --> 11:19.309
SAY YES. OKAY, I-I YELLED
AT HIM THIS MORNING.

11:19.309 --> 11:22.182
I ACTED LIKE AN ASS--
WHAT ARE THE RISKS?

11:22.182 --> 11:24.815
I MEAN, THEY HAVE TO BE
PRETTY SERIOUS, RIGHT?

11:24.815 --> 11:27.317
OTHERWISE, THE FDA WOULD'VE
ALREADY APPROVED IT.

11:27.317 --> 11:29.720
DR. BAILEY?

11:29.720 --> 11:31.722
Y-YEAH, THERE ARE RISKS,
OF COURSE.

11:31.722 --> 11:33.724
I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO GET THERE.

11:33.724 --> 11:36.767
UM...
THERE'S HEAVY BLEEDING,

11:36.767 --> 11:39.169
UH, LOW PLATELET COUNTS,

11:39.169 --> 11:41.701
UM, AND STRESS
ON THE LIVER.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.173
BUT IN CLARA'S CONDITION,

11:43.173 --> 11:45.836
E-ESPECIALLY SINCE WE'VE DONE
EVERYTHING ELSE,

11:45.836 --> 11:49.409
UM, THIS REALLY IS
THE BEST OPTION.

11:49.409 --> 11:52.382
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

11:52.382 --> 11:55.185
CAN WE HAVE SOME MORE TIME?
IS THAT OKAY?

11:55.185 --> 11:57.187
OH, Y--OF COURSE. YEAH.

11:57.187 --> 12:00.320
T-TAKE ALL THE TIME
YOU NEED.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.222
ELI?

12:04.154 --> 12:06.827
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

12:06.827 --> 12:09.399
GO DO SOMETHING ELSE.

12:09.399 --> 12:11.802
WHAT WAS THAT?
WHAT WAS WHAT?

12:11.802 --> 12:14.164
I WAS GETTING TO THOSE RISKS.

12:14.164 --> 12:17.167
YOU INTERRUPTED ME TO SEEM LIKE
I WAS HIDING SOMETHING.
WELL, IN MY EXPERIENCE,
DOCTORS DO HIDE THINGS.

12:17.167 --> 12:20.310
I JUST ASKED A QUESTION THEY
DIDN'T KNOW TO ASK. THAT'S ALL.
NO, THAT'S NOT YOUR JOB.

12:20.310 --> 12:23.143
I THINK IT IS.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.145
TO UNDERMINE SURGEONS
AND ALARM PATIENTS?

12:25.145 --> 12:27.347
TO CARE FOR PATIENTS--
THAT'S MY JOB.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.019
MAKING SURE THEY UNDERSTAND

12:29.019 --> 12:30.781
WHAT HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL
PROCEDURES

12:30.781 --> 12:33.453
THEY'RE SIGNING UP FOR
SEEMS A PART OF THAT.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.455
OH, I THOUGHT THAT WAS
MY JOB, YOU KNOW,

12:35.455 --> 12:37.757
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT
I AM THE ONE WHO SPECIALIZES

12:37.757 --> 12:39.429
IN SAID
HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES.

12:39.429 --> 12:42.863
OH. OKAY. I GET IT. YOU'RE
THE DOCTOR. I'M THE NURSE.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.865
I SHOULD KNOW MY PLACE, RIGHT?
N--OKAY, ENOUGH.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.166
UM, THERE IS

12:46.166 --> 12:48.869
A DOCTOR-NURSE PROTOCOL
IN THIS HOSPITAL FOR A REASON.

12:48.869 --> 12:51.842
YOU KNOW IT. I KNOW IT.
LET'S JUST AGREE TO FOLLOW IT.

12:51.842 --> 12:54.104
NOT IF IT HURTS
THE PATIENT.

12:54.104 --> 12:56.807
WH--

12:56.807 --> 13:00.780
(indistinct conversations)

13:00.780 --> 13:02.412
HEY. YOU PAGED.

13:02.412 --> 13:04.414
YEAH. UM, I DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA BE ABLE

13:04.414 --> 13:06.857
TO MAKE IT TO DINNER BY 7:00.

13:06.857 --> 13:09.389
THESE POST-OPS ARE TAKING ME
LONGER THAN I THOUGHT.
OKAY, SKIP DINNER.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.892
HEY, YOU KNOW, "FROM HERE
TO ETERNITY" IS ON CABLE.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.894
WE COULD JUST GRAB DINNER
AT MY PLACE.

13:13.894 --> 13:16.196
(indistinct conversations
continue)

13:16.196 --> 13:17.968
OKAY. SOUNDS FUN.

13:17.968 --> 13:20.800
UM, I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT TIME I'LL FINISH.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.803
KAREV, COULD YOU HELP
DR. KEPNER WITH HER PATIENTS?

13:23.803 --> 13:25.805
NOW YOU NEED MY HELP?

13:25.805 --> 13:28.208
DON'T PUSH ME, DUDE.

13:30.340 --> 13:32.983
OKAY,
SO IF YOU TAKE THESE,

13:32.983 --> 13:35.385
THEN I CAN DO THE REST.
(laughs)

13:35.385 --> 13:37.047
WHAT?

13:37.047 --> 13:39.049
THE ONLY WAY YOU'LL BE
WATCHING THAT MOVIE

13:39.049 --> 13:41.051
IS IF IT'S PLAYING
ON HIS BEDROOM CEILING.

13:41.051 --> 13:42.993
(elevator bell dings)

13:42.993 --> 13:44.955
(laughs)

13:44.955 --> 13:46.957
(Cristina) HIS E.K.G.
AND CARDIAC ENZYMES WERE NORMAL,

13:46.957 --> 13:48.999
SO A HEART ATTACK
SEEMS UNLIKELY.

13:48.999 --> 13:51.331
WE'RE DOING A C.T. ANGIO TO RULE
OUT DISSECTION OR ANEURYSM.

13:51.331 --> 13:54.434
DR. ALTMAN, YOU OKAY
TO STAY ON THE CASE,

13:54.434 --> 13:57.337
CONSIDERING
YOUR PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP?

13:57.337 --> 13:59.839
RICHARD,
WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.072
IT'S A BUSINESS ARRANGEMENT.
NOTHING MORE.

14:05.976 --> 14:07.878
(clears throat)

14:07.878 --> 14:09.479
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

14:09.479 --> 14:11.481
GREAT. GREAT.

14:11.481 --> 14:13.884
GREAT. GREAT, GREAT, GREAT.

14:13.884 --> 14:15.886
PAINKILLERS FINALLY
KICKED IN, HUH?

14:15.886 --> 14:17.227
MM-HMM.

14:17.227 --> 14:19.559
WELL, ENJOY THE RIDE.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.361
I'VE BEEN THINKING LATELY,

14:21.361 --> 14:23.863
AND I THINK--I, UH, I THINK
I FIGURED IT OUT.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.997
AND... WHY ALL OF YOUR DATES
GO SO BAD.

14:26.997 --> 14:28.999
MM-HMM.
SO, SO BAD.

14:28.999 --> 14:30.500
LAUGHABLY BAD.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.242
AND IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

14:32.242 --> 14:36.106
IT'S MINE, 'CAUSE I'M--I'M
NOT THE GUY ON THEM WITH YOU.

14:37.948 --> 14:40.911
(clears throat)
WE'RE READY TO START.
TEDDY, WAIT, WAIT.

14:40.911 --> 14:42.552
YOU'RE MY WIFE.

14:42.552 --> 14:44.054
YOU'REMYWIFE.

14:44.054 --> 14:46.286
HENRY, UM--
I'M YOUR HUSBAND.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.919
Let's do it.
Let's be together.

14:48.919 --> 14:50.890
I MEAN, LOOK AT YOU.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.893
Look at your eyes.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.626
LOOK AT--YOU'RE NOT LOOKING
AT YOUR EYES.

14:56.626 --> 14:59.970
I COULD LOOK INTO YOUR EYES
MY WHOLE LIFE.

14:59.970 --> 15:01.972
(monitor beeps rhythmically)

15:15.015 --> 15:17.317
BUSINESS ARRANGEMENT?
HE'S HOPPED UP
ON PAINKILLERS.

15:17.317 --> 15:20.120
WHICH JUST MEANS
HIS INHIBITIONS ARE DOWN.
OH, COME ON, RICHARD.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.492
LOOK, EVEN IF HE MEANT
WHAT HE SAID, I--

15:22.492 --> 15:25.055
I DON'T FEEL THAT WAY.
I-I DON'T.
(computer beeps)

15:25.055 --> 15:28.028
AND SCANS ARE UP.
(beeping)

15:28.028 --> 15:30.500
DAMN IT. HE'S GOT A MASS.
IT'S CLOSE TO HIS HEART.

15:30.500 --> 15:33.063
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
TAKE IT OUT RIGHT AWAY.
YOU?

15:33.063 --> 15:36.936
I'M NOT SURE I SHOULD
ALLOW YOU IN THAT O.R.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.938
LET ALONE ALLOW YOU
TO OPERATE ON HIM.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.311
CHIEF, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT--
I CAN DO IT.

15:41.311 --> 15:43.473
IT'S AN EXTREMELY DELICATE
SURGERY.

15:43.473 --> 15:45.976
I SOLOED ON A SIMILAR SURGERY
LAST MONTH.

15:45.976 --> 15:48.518
I NAILED IT...
IS WHAT YOU SAID.

15:48.518 --> 15:50.020
PROBLEM SOLVED.

15:50.020 --> 15:52.522
YANG WILL DO THE SURGERY.
YOU'LL SUPERVISE.
CHIEF--

15:52.522 --> 15:54.584
I'VE MADE MY DECISION,
DR. ALTMAN.

15:54.584 --> 15:56.156
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

15:58.228 --> 16:00.230
HE WAS GONNA KICK YOU
OUT OF THE O.R.

16:00.230 --> 16:02.592
AT LEAST THIS WAY,
YOU GET TO STAY IN.

16:02.592 --> 16:04.234
IT'S WIN-WIN.

16:06.736 --> 16:09.669
(people speaking indistinctly)

16:09.669 --> 16:12.602
YAY! WHOO!
OH, THANKS!

16:12.602 --> 16:15.445
DON'T FEEL BAD.
I'VE KNOWN TORRES A LONG TIME.

16:15.445 --> 16:17.607
SHE'S A TRADITIONAL GIRL,
CATHOLIC.

16:17.607 --> 16:20.180
YOU KNOW, THIS WHOLE
BABY-OUT-OF-WEDLOCK THING,

16:20.180 --> 16:23.253
THE THREE PARENTS--IT'S A LOT
FOR HER TO SWALLOW.

16:23.253 --> 16:25.255
THAT'S WHY I FIGURED,
THE BIGGER SHOWER, THE BETTER.

16:25.255 --> 16:27.117
OH, SHUT UP.
EXCUSE ME?

16:27.117 --> 16:29.159
YOU'RE NOT
THE CALLIE WHISPERER.

16:29.159 --> 16:32.592
AND I'M NOT A MONSTER FOR
FINDING BABY SHOWERS ANNOYING.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.594
EVERY WOMAN WHO'S EVER HAD
A PREGNANT FRIEND HATES THEM.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.096
IT'S LIKE A WEDDING.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.128
THE BRIDESMAIDS ALWAYS WANT
TO STRANGLE THE BRIDE.

16:38.128 --> 16:39.629
IT'S PRACTICALLY A RULE.

16:39.629 --> 16:42.432

HERE IS YOU FOR ACTING LIKE

WHO GOT WHAT,

26:58.748 --> 27:01.921

AS THE TYPE OF PEOPLE

27:01.921 --> 27:04.794

THANK-YOU NOTES.
I'M NOT SURE THAT'S ACTUALLY
A TYPE OF PEOPLE.

27:04.794 --> 27:06.796

CONGRATULATIONS.

27:13.062 --> 27:15.665
YOU'RE A BETTER WOMAN
THAN I AM.
HEY, IT'S OKAY.

27:15.665 --> 27:17.867
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

27:17.867 --> 27:20.109
MARK, CAN YOU GIVE US
A MINUTE?

27:22.812 --> 27:25.344
SHE LOST THE GIFT LIST,
