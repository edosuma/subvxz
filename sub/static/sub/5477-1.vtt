00:39.086 --> 00:40.610
Whoo!

00:40.687 --> 00:43.485
Oh, yeah! Yeah, you want to dance?

00:43.557 --> 00:45.684
You don't mind if I get up in there, do you?

00:47.529 --> 00:50.395
- This is kind of sexy.
- Yeah. Love it!

00:50.464 --> 00:51.932
You're kind of sexy.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.093
You should take one of these.
Very lightweight on your shoulders, ladies.

00:55.169 --> 00:58.662
Try it out, try it out. There you go.
Feels good, yeah?

00:58.740 --> 00:59.729
Whoo!

01:00.240 --> 01:01.674
Whoo!

01:02.544 --> 01:03.875
Here.

01:03.945 --> 01:07.005
Follow me, ladies.
Follow me to the cash register.

01:07.482 --> 01:09.416
I see you guys.
You guys look like you smoke weed, right?

01:09.484 --> 01:11.679
Okay, you're gonna smoke a bowl,
you're gonna buy one of these TVs.

01:11.753 --> 01:13.744
Philips, all right.
You know, you're kind of high, feels good.

01:13.822 --> 01:15.551
Samsung, kind of last year.

01:15.623 --> 01:17.251
Magnavox, bam!

01:17.326 --> 01:19.850
That's an explosion!
You're stoned, it'll blow your mind!

01:19.928 --> 01:21.794
You want to go really small, I got this one.

01:21.864 --> 01:24.889
Really small. Look at this flip-phone. Look.

01:25.366 --> 01:27.335
"Hello, Joan. What are you doing?"

01:27.403 --> 01:30.303
- "I don't know. What are you doing?"
- "I'm great. "

01:38.514 --> 01:41.449
- You are so bad.
- Guys? Christy.

01:42.151 --> 01:43.311
Hey.

01:46.756 --> 01:50.555
Said one, two princes kneel before you

01:50.626 --> 01:52.151
That's what I said now

01:53.462 --> 01:55.589
Here, take my card. Take my card.

01:58.767 --> 02:00.792
Take my card. Okay? Take my card.

02:01.972 --> 02:06.409
Go, Joan. Go, Joan. Go, Joan. Go, Joan.

02:06.476 --> 02:09.502
In the house. Go, Joan. Go, Joan.

02:11.848 --> 02:13.281
Oh. Sorry, Joan.

02:17.521 --> 02:21.253
Okay, squeeze the nipple.
Squeeze the nipple. Harder.

02:22.759 --> 02:24.818
Okay. Oh, my God!

02:25.128 --> 02:27.461
- What are you doing?
- Feel that.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.561
We can't do this. Jerry's right out there.

02:32.637 --> 02:33.626
He can watch.

02:35.105 --> 02:36.801
What makes you so damn sexy?

02:38.209 --> 02:39.267
Oh, my God.

02:43.481 --> 02:44.505
I promise you, man,

02:44.582 --> 02:47.210
80 watts is more than
you'll ever need for a living room.

02:47.852 --> 02:49.251
Excuse me.

02:51.189 --> 02:54.624
- Hello?
- Oh, Jesus. Harder.

02:54.992 --> 02:56.017
Oh!

02:56.094 --> 02:58.357
- Okay. Oh!
- What the...

02:58.963 --> 03:00.522
You fucking piece of shit!

03:00.599 --> 03:01.998
You fucked up son of a bitch!

03:02.067 --> 03:04.227
Christy! What the hell is wrong with you?

03:04.302 --> 03:06.601
- How can I ever trust you again?
- I don't know. I'm so sorry.

03:06.672 --> 03:07.969
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- No, I...

03:08.040 --> 03:10.634
You know, Fujitsu makes the same unit
for 40 bucks less.

03:10.709 --> 03:12.802
- Really?
- Yeah, but they don't sell it here.

03:12.878 --> 03:14.209
Oh...

03:14.279 --> 03:17.180
But I could get it for you, if you want.

03:17.249 --> 03:18.409
Oh! Are you, like, okay?

03:20.219 --> 03:21.243
Oh.

03:21.321 --> 03:22.753
- Yeah.
- Okay.

03:22.821 --> 03:24.311
Give me your number.
I'll let you know when I have it.

03:24.456 --> 03:25.446
Um...

03:25.558 --> 03:27.286
- What's your name?
- Amber.

03:27.359 --> 03:29.122
- You have beautiful eyes.
- Shut the fuck up, Christy!

03:29.795 --> 03:30.820
You.

03:31.598 --> 03:33.588
Don't you ever fucking come in here again!

03:33.665 --> 03:36.658
You know what? You owe me commission
on $54,000 worth of second-rate,

03:36.736 --> 03:40.502
knock-off, gray-market, off-brand,
overpriced equipment, you son of a bitch.

03:40.573 --> 03:42.564
I'll fucking kill you, you piece of shit!

03:42.642 --> 03:43.836
You know what?
Why don't you just send it to me?

03:43.910 --> 03:44.934
Christy knows the address.

03:45.945 --> 03:48.379
Amber! 434-6603!

03:52.719 --> 03:53.879
Why don't you tell Daddy

03:53.953 --> 03:56.149
what a downtown Chicago hospital
is really like?

03:56.223 --> 04:00.023
Patient brought in with chills,
nausea, ischemia, clearly in shock.

04:00.094 --> 04:01.356
Did you do a CBC?

04:01.428 --> 04:04.521
Excuse me, our protocols didn't
exist when you went to medical school.

04:04.597 --> 04:07.931
Oh! Yes, I've been under a rock
these past 30 years.

04:08.002 --> 04:10.869
How many transdermal intubations
have you personally done?

04:10.938 --> 04:15.068
My dear, I teach medicine. I no longer
sully my hands touching actual patients.

04:15.209 --> 04:16.733
- Ha!
- Touch patients?

04:16.810 --> 04:18.402
Why would anybody want to do that?

04:18.478 --> 04:20.470
You are not allowed in this conversation.

04:20.547 --> 04:22.742
Excuse me. I've helped more patients
than you ever will.

04:22.816 --> 04:24.147
Can I pour this drink on your head?

04:24.218 --> 04:26.016
What is wrong with getting rich?

04:26.087 --> 04:28.054
God only knows you can't do that
in medicine anymore.

04:28.122 --> 04:30.990
- He's right about that!
- Don't help him justify his laziness.

04:31.059 --> 04:33.219
I already justified my laziness.

04:33.293 --> 04:36.593
It's called $35 million on my first IPO.

04:37.165 --> 04:38.153
Jamie, help me.

04:38.232 --> 04:41.669
- He's a geek who got lucky.
- And he'll always be a geek.

04:41.736 --> 04:43.670
Yeah? Well, this geek
is taking back your shares.

04:43.738 --> 04:44.796
I don't blame you.

04:44.873 --> 04:46.898
The profession was ruined
when they let women in.

04:46.975 --> 04:47.999
I'm killing both of you.

04:48.076 --> 04:51.512
I'm killing all of you
if you don't get in there and sit down.

04:51.579 --> 04:54.139
And we get to keep all the shares.

04:54.350 --> 04:55.578
- Ugh!
- All right.

04:59.287 --> 05:01.085
Jamie!

05:01.657 --> 05:02.782
Of course, it really happened.

05:02.857 --> 05:04.826
Who wants to see
a movie about protesting?

05:04.894 --> 05:06.521
Whatever.

05:06.595 --> 05:09.119
To the sale of Josh's company!

05:09.197 --> 05:11.166
- Whatever the hell it does.
- Yes!

05:11.500 --> 05:14.059
Long live medical software.

05:14.704 --> 05:16.399
And med school dropouts everywhere.

05:16.472 --> 05:17.734
You'd better give
some of this money away,

05:17.807 --> 05:19.241
- that's all I have to say.
- Not gonna happen.

05:19.309 --> 05:20.832
Jamie, what are you up to these days?

05:20.910 --> 05:24.870
- Jamie's selling high-end stereo equipment.
- Ha!

05:25.781 --> 05:26.907
Not anymore.

05:29.686 --> 05:30.778
What do you mean?

05:30.854 --> 05:34.187
Well, let's just say Jamie had
a falling out with management.

05:38.127 --> 05:39.823
I thought you were in real estate.

05:39.896 --> 05:42.922
I am looking for other opportunities.

05:42.999 --> 05:46.799
We're living through the greatest creation
of wealth in modern history,

05:46.870 --> 05:48.132
and my brother decides to quit.

05:50.607 --> 05:54.510
Josh has been talking to me
about pharmaceutical sales.

05:54.579 --> 05:55.875
Pharmaceutical sales?

05:55.946 --> 05:56.935
Pharmaceutical sales.

05:57.013 --> 05:59.778
You know, medicine that's
supposed to help people get better.

05:59.851 --> 06:02.341
Remember Timmy,
my roommate from Brown?

06:02.419 --> 06:04.479
He's a VP at Pfizer. So I said to Jamie,

06:04.555 --> 06:07.352
"Jamie, if you suck on my cock,
I'll get you an interview. "

06:07.491 --> 06:09.619
- Oh, Josh, watch your mouth!
- Watch your mouth!

06:09.694 --> 06:11.093
I said no, Mom. I said no.

06:13.363 --> 06:15.423
Why would you wanna be
a pharmaceutical rep?

06:15.500 --> 06:17.229
"Why would you wanna be
a pharmaceutical rep?"

06:17.301 --> 06:20.862
Because it's the only entry-level job in
America that pays over 100 grand a year.

06:20.938 --> 06:21.962
- That's why.
- No.

06:22.039 --> 06:24.803
Those people come into our office
with their roller bags and samples,

06:24.876 --> 06:26.070
like door-to-door-salesmen.

06:26.144 --> 06:27.543
They are door-to-door-salesmen,

06:27.612 --> 06:30.047
only what they're selling
grosses $87 billion a year!

06:30.115 --> 06:31.945
Yeah, and they're turning
complex medical decisions

06:32.016 --> 06:33.278
- into Madison Avenue impulse buying.
- Oh, my God.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.717
Look, I'm not selling to the patients, okay?

06:34.787 --> 06:36.276
No. No, the patients just see
the commercials on TV...

06:36.354 --> 06:37.514
I'm not even doing the job yet!

06:37.588 --> 06:39.216
...and demand their name-brand drugs
from the doctors...

06:39.291 --> 06:41.816
Calm down, you're freaking out.
- ... and there you are to supply them.

06:41.894 --> 06:42.882
This is so crazy

06:42.960 --> 06:44.519
that you're yelling at me for nothing!
I'm not doing it!

06:44.596 --> 06:49.966
If you barbarians won't be still
and finish this lamb,

06:51.303 --> 06:53.670
none of you will get the chocolate cake.

06:54.239 --> 06:56.036
Yes, Mom!

07:04.050 --> 07:06.449
Oh, Jamie,
if you could make money fucking,

07:06.518 --> 07:08.646
you'd be even richer than me.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.284
I'll call the Pfizer guy in the morning.

07:15.995 --> 07:20.659
Let's welcome the class of 1997 trainees!

07:27.841 --> 07:32.278
This is not a pill. This is tens
of millions of dollars in research.

07:32.612 --> 07:36.013
This is thousands of hours of hard labor.

07:36.082 --> 07:39.075
This, ladies and gentlemen, is software.

07:39.587 --> 07:41.076
Your training will last six weeks.

07:41.154 --> 07:45.057
Each of you will leave here
a fully qualified health care professional.

07:45.125 --> 07:47.388
That's 33% fewer phone calls
for you at 4:00 a. m.

07:47.460 --> 07:49.861
That's 33% less angry... Shit!

07:50.664 --> 07:53.132
Your job will be to go fight illness.

08:00.374 --> 08:02.171
Hello... Fuck!

08:02.711 --> 08:03.905
Shit!

08:04.712 --> 08:08.376
Ah! Fuck! Ah! Shit! Ow!

08:08.717 --> 08:12.949
Off-label uses are benefits
not yet recognized by the FDA.

08:13.755 --> 08:17.451
But you can boost sales
by hinting at what these uses are.

08:17.524 --> 08:19.083
Hello, Doctor.
Do you know that prescribing Zithromax...

08:19.160 --> 08:20.752
Prescribing Zithromax...

08:22.097 --> 08:23.428
Bonjour, Doctor!

08:23.498 --> 08:25.591
Prescribing Zithromax... Zithromax.

08:25.667 --> 08:26.759
Ah!

08:27.002 --> 08:30.768
Zoloft, a drug approved solely
for the treatment of depression.

08:30.839 --> 08:34.832
Off-label uses: alcoholism, bulimia, PMS,

08:34.909 --> 08:37.037
smoking, social anxiety.

08:37.580 --> 08:38.740
Is there a question?

08:42.082 --> 08:45.417
Zoloft has been associated
with suicidal ideation in teenagers.

08:45.488 --> 08:46.511
Unproven.

08:46.588 --> 08:47.783
Proven. Unreported.

08:49.258 --> 08:52.090
Your job will be to
go share this technology.

08:53.462 --> 08:56.625
Your job will be to go save lives.

08:57.301 --> 09:00.360
The health care industry today
is worth $2 trillion a year.

09:00.670 --> 09:03.196
The top 10 pharma companies
make more money

09:03.273 --> 09:08.233
than all 490 of the other
Fortune 500 companies combined.

09:08.312 --> 09:11.747
- What family is Feldene a part of?
- Non-steroidal...

09:11.814 --> 09:14.716
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory.
An NSAID.

09:17.821 --> 09:21.120
A better world, that's why we're here.

09:21.191 --> 09:22.658
Lipitor in Palm Beach!

09:24.227 --> 09:25.660
Xanax, New England!

09:27.898 --> 09:29.422
What about you, Jamie-bamie?

09:29.499 --> 09:32.526
Zoloft and Zithromax
in the Ohio River Valley.

09:33.104 --> 09:34.832
Welcome to Pfizer!

09:46.750 --> 09:49.117
What are you thinking about?

09:49.187 --> 09:50.449
Money.

09:54.058 --> 09:55.082
Pay attention.

09:55.159 --> 09:58.925
We are not going door-to-door selling
oatmeal cookies for the Girl Scouts here.

09:58.997 --> 10:01.865
You are not the goddamn Avon lady.
You understand what I'm saying?

10:03.201 --> 10:05.931
This is hardcore sales,
and you have a quota.

10:06.004 --> 10:08.530
And people at the home office
keeping track of that quota.

10:08.606 --> 10:11.040
And your cold calls, and your mileage,
and your receipts.

10:11.109 --> 10:12.737
How often you goddamn masturbate.

10:12.811 --> 10:14.210
What is the quota for masturbation?

10:15.913 --> 10:18.144
You can masturbate
as much as you like, smartass,

10:18.217 --> 10:19.582
as long as you make a lot of money.

10:19.651 --> 10:20.810
Okay.

10:21.687 --> 10:23.450
Voila!
Okay, now, remember.

10:23.522 --> 10:25.422
Hospitals have a no-reps policy.

10:25.491 --> 10:29.052
Doesn't mean we can't give the docs
a nice, dry walk from their cars.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.126
All right?

10:31.564 --> 10:32.655
There he is. All right.

10:32.731 --> 10:33.789
No time like the present.

10:33.866 --> 10:35.163
- Get your head in the game.
- All right.

10:35.234 --> 10:36.827
- Remember, Pfizer makes his life better.
- Okay.

10:36.903 --> 10:38.767
Pfizer makes his patients happier,

10:38.837 --> 10:40.304
- so he makes more money.
- Okay.

10:40.372 --> 10:42.568
- Wait, the pens, the pens!
- Oh, the pens!

10:42.642 --> 10:43.631
Always lead with a pen.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.171
Gifts establish reciprocity!

10:48.381 --> 10:49.370
Doctor!

10:49.616 --> 10:52.016
Hey, Doctor, Jamie Randall. Pfizer.
How are you doing?

10:52.085 --> 10:53.882
- No, thank you.
- Look... It's wet out here.

10:53.953 --> 10:55.614
I don't want you compromising
your immune system.

10:55.688 --> 10:56.814
Let's talk about Zithromax for a second.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.323
Which part of "No, thank you"
do you not understand?

10:58.391 --> 10:59.517
- You wanna take a pen?
- No, thank you.

10:59.592 --> 11:00.786
Okay.

11:04.230 --> 11:06.290
That's 33% fewer phone calls for you
at 4:00 a. m.

11:06.367 --> 11:07.356
Please stop, okay?

11:07.435 --> 11:08.867
That's why I wanna talk to you
about Zithromax, okay?

11:08.935 --> 11:10.994
We are throwing antibiotics at people
the minute they sneeze,

11:11.072 --> 11:12.096
and it doesn't work on viruses anyway.

11:12.173 --> 11:13.367
- What's your name?
- Goldstein.

11:13.441 --> 11:15.499
Right. Dr. Goldstein,
okay, what we're doing...

11:15.909 --> 11:18.743
No, what you're doing is creating
classes of drug-resistant superbugs.

11:18.813 --> 11:20.302
And that might be good for business,

11:20.380 --> 11:22.815
because you will develop
stronger antibiotics

11:22.883 --> 11:24.578
and ruin people's
immune systems altogether.

11:24.652 --> 11:26.279
- No... You...
- Thank you.

11:38.099 --> 11:41.433
Models. Beauty queens.

11:41.770 --> 11:44.602
Equestrian princesses. Shit.

11:44.839 --> 11:47.900
You know what I heard?
They're even starting to hire strippers.

11:48.677 --> 11:50.405
I heard that.

11:54.683 --> 11:55.809
Hey, Lisa!

11:58.887 --> 12:01.720
- Her name's not Lisa.
- I know. I know.

12:01.790 --> 12:03.781
But if every time I say, "Hey, Lisa,"

12:03.859 --> 12:06.055
then eventually she'll come up to me
and she'll be like, you know,

12:06.129 --> 12:10.725
"My name's not Lisa, it's Jennifer,"
or whatever, and I'll do a big apology

12:10.800 --> 12:15.099
and I'll say, "I thought you were the Lisa
who was mad at me for not calling. "

12:15.170 --> 12:17.696
And from then on, Jennifer,
or whatever her name is,

12:17.773 --> 12:21.072
will think that I dated a girl
who looked just like her, who I rejected.

12:21.144 --> 12:23.374
She'll develop this unconscious need
to win my approval,

12:23.446 --> 12:25.676
and from then on, it's cake.

12:27.750 --> 12:29.081
Damn!

12:30.285 --> 12:33.915
Accepted etiquette is one rep at a time.
Screw etiquette.

12:33.990 --> 12:37.517
Competing reps are not your friends.
Okay, Knight.

12:37.593 --> 12:39.117
- Where you going?
- Oh. Sorry.

12:39.195 --> 12:40.959
Knight is a doc you gotta close.

12:41.031 --> 12:42.361
Leads the largest group in the city.

12:42.431 --> 12:45.424
Lots of fucked-up college students
on Prozac who should be on Zoloft.

12:45.502 --> 12:46.730
You always bring donuts?

12:46.803 --> 12:48.565
Pharma sales is a lot like dating.

12:48.638 --> 12:51.540
They want you to take them to dinner
and pretend to expect nothing in return.

12:51.608 --> 12:53.905
- And no one ever got laid by going Dutch.
- Exactly.

12:55.679 --> 12:58.239
Gail, good morning!
How are you this fine day?

13:06.023 --> 13:08.048
Sick people touch those.

13:09.126 --> 13:12.823
When I order a second test,
it's for a reason, God damn it.

13:13.030 --> 13:14.292
Unbelievable!

13:14.364 --> 13:17.027
That's him. Another time.

13:19.636 --> 13:23.367
If they don't take us in five minutes,
we leave. Only losers wait.

13:23.440 --> 13:24.634
There he is.

13:24.708 --> 13:26.074
Hey there, beautiful. How you doing?

13:26.744 --> 13:28.541
Get over here, Trey.

13:29.646 --> 13:31.581
Two tickets to La Bohème on the 19th.

13:31.649 --> 13:34.641
I hate you. Can't you go with me
instead of my husband?

13:34.719 --> 13:39.281
Trey Hannigan. Lilly's Prozac rep,
top 10 nationally. The Devil.

13:39.357 --> 13:41.348
He's on the phone with Watson.
You can go on back.

13:41.426 --> 13:43.860
He's the reason
we never make our quota on Zoloft.

13:46.865 --> 13:49.162
- Is he going in?
- What a dick!

13:49.234 --> 13:52.965
If we can show 5% gains monthly,
we're going to the promised land.

13:53.771 --> 13:55.433
The promised land?

13:55.507 --> 13:56.974
Chicago.

13:57.042 --> 13:59.134
Civilization. Culture.

13:59.210 --> 14:02.112
And not incidentally, my wife and kids.

14:02.181 --> 14:04.308
Only the great and near-great get Chicago,

14:04.383 --> 14:07.079
but I got a hunch
that you and your swinging dick

14:07.152 --> 14:08.813
might be my ticket to the big leagues.

14:20.100 --> 14:21.158
Good morning.

14:21.234 --> 14:23.827
Doctor only sees new reps
who bring a lunch.

14:23.902 --> 14:25.530
Here's a list of available dates.

14:25.605 --> 14:27.436
- The first one is in five weeks.
- Great.

14:27.507 --> 14:31.466
Here's a list of approved foods,
no sushi, no salads.

14:31.544 --> 14:32.738
No salads.

14:32.812 --> 14:34.939
Leave your samples with me.

14:35.749 --> 14:37.444
- Hi.
- Five weeks.

14:38.151 --> 14:39.244
You're going to like me.

14:40.287 --> 14:41.311
I beg your pardon?

14:41.388 --> 14:44.016
Sooner or later, everybody does.
You wanna know why?

14:44.558 --> 14:47.492
'Cause I'll do whatever it takes
to make that happen. I'm very trainable.

14:47.560 --> 14:50.291
- What's your name?
- Gail. Five weeks.

14:50.364 --> 14:51.763
Oh, Gail, that's not fair.

14:51.832 --> 14:53.128
I'm laying myself bare here.

14:53.199 --> 14:57.136
I'm revealing my true vulnerability.
And now you're stonewalling me.

14:57.971 --> 14:58.960
Is that fair?

14:59.307 --> 15:01.775
- That's not fair.
- You stay out of this.

15:01.842 --> 15:04.436
Look at you angels of mercy! How do
the docs get any work done around here?

15:04.512 --> 15:05.843
Fine. What do you want?

15:06.847 --> 15:09.373
I just want you to let me leave my samples
where he'll see them.

15:09.451 --> 15:11.714
'Cause otherwise, you're gonna
throw them away after I leave.

15:17.992 --> 15:20.325
Gail. No sushi, no salads.

15:33.875 --> 15:34.933
Who let you back here?

15:35.677 --> 15:38.305
Oh! Dr. Knight! Do you know that
prescribing Zithromax for ear infections,

15:38.380 --> 15:40.439
- diarrhea and...
- Cindy! Can you deal with this, please?

15:40.515 --> 15:42.915
How about a pen?
Do you want a pen?

15:58.367 --> 16:01.360
- Okay, Prince Charming, time's up.
- Oh! Okay.

16:02.205 --> 16:04.901
Wow! That is a long handle!

16:04.974 --> 16:06.566
- Would you like a pen?
- Thanks.

16:06.642 --> 16:07.666
Purple.

16:07.744 --> 16:09.109
- Bye.
- Bye.

16:31.201 --> 16:32.326
Uh,

16:32.402 --> 16:34.928
I got something for you today.

16:35.005 --> 16:38.668
Wait, I think... Yup.
There's another one for you, too!

16:40.844 --> 16:45.611
The thing about these pens is that
they have tiny little point tips on them,

16:45.682 --> 16:48.083
and then I end up pressing too hard, and...

16:48.153 --> 16:49.814
Hello, gorgeous.

16:50.587 --> 16:52.919
Jamie! Jamie, they're beautiful!

17:06.771 --> 17:08.432
Hey, Lisa!

17:11.242 --> 17:15.974
Okay, this may have worked for you
in the past, but let me lay it out.

17:16.580 --> 17:19.914
I became a rep for one reason, doctors.

17:20.551 --> 17:24.819
To meet doctors, fraternize with doctors,
breed with doctors.

17:25.457 --> 17:29.394
So next time you see me in the field,
don't ask for a handout.

17:29.462 --> 17:31.292
It's just awkward.

17:34.633 --> 17:38.228
I want Chicago, Randall. And right now,
you're not making it happen!

17:38.304 --> 17:42.570
You're 20% below your quota for Z,
you're 45% below your quota for Zoloft!

17:42.809 --> 17:44.742
You want me off your ass, you punk?

17:44.810 --> 17:46.675
There's your answer.

17:47.480 --> 17:51.348
He's got toddlers taking Prozac.
He's got dogs taking Prozac.

17:51.417 --> 17:54.319
He'd have rocks taking Prozac
if they paid cash.

17:54.387 --> 17:56.980
And by the way, you want
one doctor to start writing Zoloft?

17:57.056 --> 17:58.115
It's the guy standing next to him.

17:58.492 --> 17:59.959
- Knight?
- Knight.

18:00.026 --> 18:01.754
Hannigan's butt buddy.

18:01.827 --> 18:05.025
But I swear, he starts writing it,
the rest of the docs will follow.

18:05.098 --> 18:06.621
And Windy City, here we come.

18:10.704 --> 18:12.968
- Dr. Knight.
- Hey, I'm very late.

18:13.039 --> 18:15.200
- One thousand dollars.
- Excuse me?

18:15.275 --> 18:18.109
- It's a check for $1,000.
- For what?

18:18.212 --> 18:19.701
For a special Pfizer preceptorship.

18:19.779 --> 18:22.806
For me to shadow you, learn your practice,
and better serve the needs of doctors.

18:23.985 --> 18:25.076
Are you bribing me?

18:25.151 --> 18:27.347
No, Doctor, no.

18:27.421 --> 18:31.322
It's a special Pfizer preceptorship
for me to shadow you.

18:32.960 --> 18:33.984
Is this a joke?

18:34.061 --> 18:36.893
If you think $1,000 is a joke.

18:39.100 --> 18:40.965
That's 33% fewer phone calls at 4:00 a. m...

18:41.068 --> 18:44.560
I'd write a lot more of your scrip
if I were a regularly paid consultant.

18:44.639 --> 18:46.539
Well, you know,
we can talk to them about that.

18:46.607 --> 18:48.666
They spend $5 billion a year
on marketing, right?

18:48.743 --> 18:49.732
Mmm-hmm.

18:49.810 --> 18:52.006
Instead of flying me to Cancún
and making me sit through

18:52.080 --> 18:54.877
some bullshit, nonsense,
peer-to-peer conference,

18:54.949 --> 18:56.678
just give me half that money in cash.

18:56.751 --> 18:57.844
- Yeah, but Cancún...
- Dr. Knight,

18:57.920 --> 18:59.012
- Mrs. Putney's on the phone. Excuse me.
- Sorry.

18:59.087 --> 19:01.520
Her daughter has to sing on Friday.
They're doing Bye Bye Birdie,

19:01.589 --> 19:04.889
and she's playing Kim, and she wondered
if you could call in an antibiotic?

19:05.460 --> 19:07.087
- Sure. Why not?
- Okay, thanks.

19:07.162 --> 19:08.220
Hey.

19:08.297 --> 19:10.492
This can't be right. Janice? Janice?

19:10.566 --> 19:12.864
A 26-year-old needs
Parkinson's medication?

19:12.935 --> 19:15.301
- Beth wrote that one up.
- Hi.

19:16.271 --> 19:19.672
All right, look, if a patient asks,
you're an intern, okay?

19:19.741 --> 19:21.903
Yeah. Can I take notes?

19:21.978 --> 19:23.638
- Sure. Why not?
- All right.

19:24.913 --> 19:26.676
Hey. I'm Dr. Knight.

19:26.749 --> 19:28.580
- Maggie Murdock.
- Hi.

19:29.085 --> 19:33.419
- So your file says, "Kind of an emergency. "
- Yeah.

19:34.057 --> 19:36.958
My apartment was burgled yesterday,
and they took my Parkinson's meds.

19:37.961 --> 19:41.590
But my symptoms are pretty good today,
so it's "kind of an emergency. "

19:42.231 --> 19:45.632
I know your Lilly rep, Trey Hannigan?
He asked Cindy to squeeze me in, so...

19:45.702 --> 19:47.067
Yeah, Trey's a great guy.

19:47.136 --> 19:49.195
Oh. Well, I wouldn't say that.

19:52.343 --> 19:53.934
So, monotherapy?

19:54.010 --> 19:56.912
Yep. Sinemet CR, 50 milligrams,
two times a day,

19:56.981 --> 20:00.211
plus Domperidone to cut the nausea,
10 milligrams, three times a day.

20:00.283 --> 20:04.050
Artane for the tremor, two milligrams,
a whole tablet, three times a day.

20:04.121 --> 20:05.747
And Prozac, so that I'm not too bummed

20:05.822 --> 20:08.587
about having
a major degenerative disorder at 26.

20:08.659 --> 20:10.558
Forty milligrams, once, in the morning.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.460
Zoloft has fewer side effects.

20:14.098 --> 20:15.258
I'm sorry, who are you?

20:15.899 --> 20:17.059
Jamie Randall.

20:17.635 --> 20:18.693
Oh.

20:18.902 --> 20:19.891
Hi.

20:20.270 --> 20:21.295
Intern.

20:24.341 --> 20:27.834
So, early-onset Parkinson's.
That's pretty rare.

20:27.912 --> 20:31.780
Yeah, yeah, yeah. First they thought it was
essential tremor, then Wilson's disease,

20:31.850 --> 20:37.117
then Huntington's.
Then, they tested for MAS, PSP, syphilis.

20:37.956 --> 20:40.423
I was very glad for a negative on that one.

20:40.491 --> 20:43.325
I didn't really relish the thought
of feeling like a 19th century slut.

20:43.762 --> 20:48.222
Let's see. Then, there was
brain tumor week, which was very scary.

20:48.299 --> 20:51.201
And then six months
chasing obscure dystonias,

20:51.270 --> 20:53.863
but, no, it just turned out to be
good, old-fashioned Parkinson's.

20:53.938 --> 20:56.737
Right. And... Don't you have a neurologist?

20:58.043 --> 20:59.374
We broke up.

21:01.213 --> 21:03.874
And do you have insurance?

21:03.948 --> 21:06.042
Do I have insurance.

21:07.620 --> 21:08.644
Okay.

21:09.055 --> 21:11.785
Well, sure. Why not?

21:11.857 --> 21:14.587
- Great.
- Is there anything else I can do for you?

21:14.660 --> 21:15.648
Nope. Oh!

21:15.795 --> 21:16.784
Um...

21:17.563 --> 21:19.326
Actually, yeah.

21:19.398 --> 21:23.425
I have a weird blotch on my breast.

21:23.502 --> 21:25.733
I don't know,
I'm trying not to freak out about it.

21:25.806 --> 21:28.330
- Well, let's have a look.
- Great.

21:32.312 --> 21:33.437
Here you go. Do you see that?

21:35.816 --> 21:38.410
- That's a spider bite.
- Is it?

21:38.485 --> 21:40.111
Yeah, that's a spider bite.

21:40.186 --> 21:41.415
Great!

21:41.722 --> 21:42.746
All right.

21:43.190 --> 21:44.748
- There you are.
- Thank you, Dr. Knight.

21:44.825 --> 21:45.849
Sure.

21:46.660 --> 21:48.321
You're welcome.

21:55.335 --> 21:56.996
- You're a drug rep?
- Wait...

21:57.070 --> 22:00.005
You let me take my shirt off,
you fucking creep!

22:00.408 --> 22:02.103
Wait, wait, wait. I'm hurt.

22:02.176 --> 22:04.200
- Your buckle just hit my eye.
- No, it didn't.

22:04.277 --> 22:05.870
- I'm hurt. I'm hurt.
- Oh, my God.

22:05.947 --> 22:07.437
Who said I was a drug rep?

22:07.515 --> 22:09.106
Excuse me, look at your bag!

22:09.616 --> 22:12.051
I don't think
you're going to the fucking airport.

22:12.120 --> 22:14.179
Okay, look, just apologize, okay?
Just apologize.

22:14.255 --> 22:15.279
Would you do that just once?

22:15.356 --> 22:18.416
I would actually like to hear someone from
the medical community actually apologize!

22:18.493 --> 22:20.893
Okay. Okay, I apologize.

22:20.962 --> 22:26.901
I apologize on behalf of all the arrogant,
faceless, cut-off, asshole doctors out there

22:26.968 --> 22:31.099
who've treated you like a non-person
while peeking at your breasts.

22:33.641 --> 22:34.733
So what's your name?

22:36.211 --> 22:37.235
You're good.

22:37.846 --> 22:41.145
Strong eye contact. Implied intimacy.
You'll make your quotas.

22:41.784 --> 22:43.547
Let me take you out
for a cup of coffee then.

22:44.953 --> 22:46.215
Whoa! What was that for?

22:46.622 --> 22:48.419
Eat shit and die, that's what that was.

22:48.490 --> 22:51.186
No, wait, wait! Hold on one second!
I can do a better apology!

22:57.132 --> 22:58.531
'Cause I want to know.

23:01.070 --> 23:04.197
The same white tights
I wear every single day.

23:04.273 --> 23:06.469
You are out of your mind.

23:06.543 --> 23:08.339
All right, nothing underneath?

23:10.680 --> 23:12.773
- You're bad!
- So,

23:13.515 --> 23:17.179
I need the number of
a patient he saw yesterday.

23:17.253 --> 23:19.983
A Murdock, or something like that.

23:20.056 --> 23:21.546
You want Maggie Murdock's number?

23:21.624 --> 23:25.287
Yes. Because she mentioned,
like, six neurologists,

23:25.361 --> 23:28.421
and Pfizer's coming out
with a new Parkinson's med,

23:28.498 --> 23:31.763
and I wanna contact them all,
and I wanna make a lot of money,

23:31.835 --> 23:33.029
Miss None Of Your Business.

23:34.270 --> 23:36.705
- We're not supposed to give out numbers.
- What?

23:36.774 --> 23:38.673
You gave me your number, you bad girl.

23:39.777 --> 23:40.903
Do your friends know
how bad you really are?

23:41.679 --> 23:43.145
Jamie!

23:43.213 --> 23:44.681
Because if they knew
how bad you really are...

23:46.784 --> 23:51.414
Listen, I promise I'll wear the stethoscope
next time we play naughty nurse.

23:56.393 --> 23:58.258
546-2312.

23:58.329 --> 24:00.662
Okay, I got to go. Thanks, bye.

24:05.303 --> 24:07.327
What are you doing here?

24:08.906 --> 24:11.239
I'm all fucked up!

24:11.877 --> 24:14.471
- Farrah kicked me out.
- No way.

24:14.880 --> 24:19.340
Can you believe that? I think she's fucking
somebody already, I swear to God!

24:19.417 --> 24:21.351
- Why did she kick you out?
- I don't know, Jamie!

24:21.419 --> 24:24.047
- Jesus!
- She said I was addicted to Internet porn.

24:24.123 --> 24:25.885
- Are you?
- Of course I am!

24:25.957 --> 24:27.584
Fuck! Isn't everybody?

24:27.659 --> 24:29.628
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, my God.

24:29.862 --> 24:31.829
I can't breathe.

24:32.864 --> 24:35.026
I'm having a panic attack.

24:35.601 --> 24:38.194
- Do you have any Ativan?
- We're Xanax.

24:38.270 --> 24:40.831
Fine, Xanax!
You have any samples of Xanax?

24:40.907 --> 24:44.741
Jamie, I'm in a really vulnerable place
right now.

24:48.915 --> 24:50.405
Okay. Okay.

24:50.883 --> 24:52.248
Okay. Hey, hey, hey.

24:52.318 --> 24:54.115
Come here, come here, come here.
It's okay.

24:54.186 --> 24:56.017
Dude! Dude!

24:57.590 --> 24:59.582
We're not huggers.

25:02.695 --> 25:05.256
Faster. Come on! We got this!

25:05.332 --> 25:08.357
- Josh, will you turn that down?
- Oh. No.

25:08.702 --> 25:10.033
Josh!

25:15.676 --> 25:17.836
- Hello?
- Why did you take that picture?

25:19.212 --> 25:21.578
Is that the girl with the tits?

25:23.283 --> 25:24.614
How'd you get my number?

25:26.253 --> 25:27.686
What, you called Knight's office?

25:29.356 --> 25:32.484
- How'd you get my number?
- From the receptionist.

25:33.060 --> 25:34.119
Who you're fucking.

25:34.329 --> 25:35.488
What'd she say?

25:35.896 --> 25:37.090
Have coffee with me.

25:38.433 --> 25:41.196
- Why?
- Because I'm a drug rep.

25:41.268 --> 25:42.462
I'm not a creep.

25:44.739 --> 25:46.229
Same thing.

25:46.307 --> 25:50.539
Look, I'm sorry that I stared at your tits,
but they're really nice.

25:54.349 --> 25:55.373
Hello?

25:56.651 --> 25:57.811
Yes. Yes.

25:58.420 --> 26:00.353
Oh, I thought you hung up for a second.

26:00.922 --> 26:02.014
Should I have?

26:02.757 --> 26:04.691
What, and miss the opportunity
of insulting me?

26:04.926 --> 26:07.292
Oh, you like being insulted?

26:09.932 --> 26:10.955
Hold on a second.

26:12.934 --> 26:13.924
Ow!

26:14.870 --> 26:15.859
Um...

26:16.537 --> 26:17.629
By the right person.

26:17.705 --> 26:21.472
Oh, my God. This is a sales call, isn't it?

26:21.543 --> 26:25.070
You're gonna stay on the phone with me
until I say yes, aren't you?

26:25.147 --> 26:27.012
Well, I take my work very seriously.

26:30.052 --> 26:31.952
5:00, Lulu's on Clark.

26:32.588 --> 26:34.022
All right. Bye.

26:38.161 --> 26:39.150
Ow!

26:39.796 --> 26:41.729
Why is your answer
to everything violence?

26:45.301 --> 26:47.029
I said 5:00.

26:50.473 --> 26:53.067
- Very cute.
- Oh! Please, you can have him.

26:53.143 --> 26:55.475
Khaki pants? No, thanks.

26:59.249 --> 27:02.013
So... What's your name?

27:02.987 --> 27:04.010
Jamie Randall.

27:04.087 --> 27:06.920
Jamie, right. Okay, sorry.
What's your game?

27:07.792 --> 27:08.816
My game?

27:08.893 --> 27:10.757
I'm sorry, right, this is
the part where we talk about

27:10.827 --> 27:13.262
where we come from
and what we majored in, in college.

27:13.330 --> 27:14.763
You have beautiful eyes.

27:15.932 --> 27:17.867
That's it? That's the best you got?

27:17.935 --> 27:19.232
I'm serious. They're beautiful.

27:19.303 --> 27:24.206
Well, thank you. Let's see, what else?
My childhood? When did I get sick?

27:24.275 --> 27:25.435
So, are you always this mean?

27:25.509 --> 27:27.373
Actually, this is me being nice.

27:32.349 --> 27:33.543
So, how's your quota this month?

27:33.617 --> 27:35.141
Have you had
your first performance review?

27:35.219 --> 27:36.550
Is that a resting tremor?

27:37.389 --> 27:38.481
Comes and goes?

27:40.024 --> 27:41.184
It's none of your business.

27:42.126 --> 27:43.458
Happens when you're nervous.

27:43.695 --> 27:46.060
Mr. Expert, why would I be nervous?

27:46.130 --> 27:48.065
- 'Cause you're interested.
- And that would make me nervous?

27:48.133 --> 27:51.363
Yeah, your mind's telling you one thing,
your body's telling you something else.

27:53.905 --> 27:56.998
You left me standing

27:57.576 --> 27:58.770
Let's go.

28:00.512 --> 28:01.536
Excuse me?

28:01.613 --> 28:03.877
You wanna close, right?
You wanna get laid?

28:03.949 --> 28:05.143
Now?

28:08.087 --> 28:12.114
Mmm. Oh, right, right, right. I'm supposed
to act like I don't know if it's right,

28:12.191 --> 28:16.149
so then you tell me that there is no right
or wrong, there's just the moment.

28:17.330 --> 28:21.663
And then I tell you that I can't,
while actually signaling to you that I can,

28:21.733 --> 28:23.793
which you don't need,
because you're not really listening,

28:23.870 --> 28:27.465
because this isn't about connection
for you, this isn't even about sex for you.

28:27.540 --> 28:31.533
This is about finding an hour or two
of relief from the pain of being you.

28:31.611 --> 28:33.044
And that's fine with me, see,

28:33.112 --> 28:36.275
because all I want is the exact same thing.

28:37.718 --> 28:40.880
You left me standing

28:40.953 --> 28:43.752
in the doorway crying

28:44.690 --> 28:47.854
Does that mean I don't have to leave a tip?

29:15.155 --> 29:18.990
And now you're thinking,
"Will I stay five minutes or ten?"

29:19.060 --> 29:21.528
And, "Where did I throw my pager?"

29:21.596 --> 29:22.927
Mmm.

29:22.997 --> 29:25.556
I'm not thinking that. It's under the table.

29:28.536 --> 29:31.801
You're probably thinking,
"What's this guy's name again?"

29:33.408 --> 29:35.069
Bye, Johnny.

29:40.648 --> 29:43.208
I think it's time for you to go.

29:43.284 --> 29:45.775
Whoa, whoa, I don't need to go.

29:45.853 --> 29:48.322
Well, I need you to go.

29:49.591 --> 29:50.922
Oh, okay.

29:56.097 --> 29:58.191
It was nice meeting you.

30:00.969 --> 30:03.632
It was nice meeting you, too.
Maybe we'll...

30:04.773 --> 30:08.766
We'll see each other around.
I'll just leave the key there.

30:09.878 --> 30:11.176
Thanks.

30:13.849 --> 30:16.512
'Cause he gets up in the morning

30:16.753 --> 30:19.118
And he goes to work at 9:00

30:20.589 --> 30:22.615
And he comes back home at 5:30

30:22.692 --> 30:25.592
Gets the same train every time

30:25.661 --> 30:29.393
'Cause his world is built 'round punctuality

30:29.466 --> 30:31.457
It never fails

30:31.534 --> 30:34.230
And he's oh, so good

30:34.604 --> 30:37.402
And he's oh, so fine

30:37.474 --> 30:39.908
And he's oh, so healthy

30:39.976 --> 30:43.070
In his body and his mind

30:43.146 --> 30:46.548
He's a well respected man about town

30:46.617 --> 30:50.986
Doing the best things so conservatively

30:52.323 --> 30:55.257
And his mother goes to meetings

30:58.229 --> 31:01.130
And she stirs the tea with councilors

31:01.198 --> 31:02.187
While discussing foreign trade

31:04.335 --> 31:05.597
What?

31:07.038 --> 31:08.699
Wait! Wait.

31:13.144 --> 31:15.009
Oh, my God. What are you doing here?

31:15.379 --> 31:16.779
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

31:16.848 --> 31:18.815
I know it's so late.

31:19.450 --> 31:20.440
Oh, my God!

31:20.519 --> 31:22.077
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

31:22.154 --> 31:23.246
Oh, my God!

31:23.854 --> 31:25.823
I didn't see anything! My glasses are off!

31:25.891 --> 31:26.983
Josh, turn around!

31:31.363 --> 31:34.355
Hi. Josh. Pleasure to meet you.

31:37.969 --> 31:41.370
I can recite
the six causes of pernicious anemia

31:41.440 --> 31:44.432
and the four stages of terminal cirrhosis.

31:44.509 --> 31:49.344
And by fourth grade, I knew what
a distended ileum felt like on palpation.

31:50.483 --> 31:52.882
So why did you bail on med school?

31:52.951 --> 31:54.481
I didn't bail. I just
couldn't finish college.

31:54.482 --> 31:56.012
I couldn't sit through a class.

31:56.222 --> 31:58.087
Oh. Ritalin at 10.

31:58.890 --> 32:00.085
Eight.

32:00.860 --> 32:02.191
Show-off.

32:03.896 --> 32:05.727
But you were really smart?

32:05.798 --> 32:09.234
Yeah. The prodigal son, with ADD.

32:10.104 --> 32:11.468
You want to know the truth?

32:11.904 --> 32:12.893
Hmm?

32:14.207 --> 32:15.971
I just couldn't give my father
the satisfaction.

32:20.247 --> 32:21.874
Does this generally work for you?

32:23.916 --> 32:25.145
What?

32:25.786 --> 32:31.656
This. The whole misunderstood-by-Dad-
I'm-a-vulnerable-guy thing.

32:32.860 --> 32:34.828
Usually. Yeah.

32:36.663 --> 32:38.654
Well, it's pretty good.

32:39.600 --> 32:40.897
Thanks.

32:40.968 --> 32:44.735
But somewhere along the line,
say, sixth grade,

32:44.806 --> 32:49.071
a girl smiled at you,
or a bunch of girls smiled at you,

32:49.978 --> 32:53.435
and, ta-da,
Jamie's good at something after all.

32:54.616 --> 32:57.107
Actually, it was the fifth grade.

32:58.652 --> 33:01.144
Why don't you have a boyfriend?

33:03.690 --> 33:04.919
I'm going.

33:07.295 --> 33:08.819
- Why?
- See...

33:11.599 --> 33:15.229
The thing is, I really like having sex,

33:15.304 --> 33:18.568
and I actually really like
having sex with you,

33:20.676 --> 33:23.041
so let's just keep it simple.

33:23.111 --> 33:24.169
I can do that.

33:24.647 --> 33:26.478
Yeah, you do seem like a shithead,

33:26.549 --> 33:28.914
so it should be all right.

33:30.486 --> 33:33.648
There's just alarms going off in my head

33:33.721 --> 33:36.953
that you're not entirely what you seem.

33:37.026 --> 33:40.689
Oh, no, no. I'm a shithead, believe me.

33:44.668 --> 33:45.895
Good.

33:46.669 --> 33:51.299
Because if you turn out
not to be a shithead, that would be bad.

33:55.512 --> 33:58.708
I'm a shithead, believe me.
Through and through.

34:20.004 --> 34:20.992
Hey!

34:22.706 --> 34:24.368
Hey, man. How are you?

34:26.376 --> 34:28.674
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

34:30.081 --> 34:32.742
Damaged cells are releasing
arachidonic acid.

34:33.116 --> 34:34.880
Your body's converting it to prostaglandin,

34:34.952 --> 34:37.512
which is triggering a fiesta
of enzymes necessary for pain.

34:38.655 --> 34:40.487
Do you wanna throw up?
It's not gonna help.

34:41.125 --> 34:43.320
It's gonna take about a minute
for the acid to dissipate

34:43.393 --> 34:45.054
and your natural morphine to kick in.

34:46.063 --> 34:48.054
- You know why I hit you?
- No! No!

34:49.001 --> 34:52.197
Prozac has helped millions of people
overcome intractable mood disorders,

34:52.570 --> 34:54.094
making miserable lives livable.

34:54.505 --> 34:56.768
It's even helped me
with some of my own anger issues.

34:57.007 --> 35:00.035
So when someone fucks with my Prozac,
it upsets me.

35:00.679 --> 35:01.770
You know what people say about me?

35:02.747 --> 35:05.182
You're in the top ten nationally?

35:05.250 --> 35:06.239
Why do you suppose that is?

35:07.085 --> 35:08.415
Fuck you!

35:09.221 --> 35:10.313
Why do you suppose that is?

35:11.356 --> 35:12.584
Because I'm ex-Marine,

35:12.658 --> 35:14.489
and I'll destroy anyone
who gets in my way.

35:14.560 --> 35:15.549
Right.

35:16.194 --> 35:17.183
Shit.

35:20.198 --> 35:21.187
Ow!

35:22.000 --> 35:22.989
Fuck.

35:23.436 --> 35:25.767
I'd ice that as soon as you can.

35:26.338 --> 35:29.069
If it hurts in a few days, get an X-ray.

35:31.944 --> 35:34.004
And stay away from Maggie.

35:38.785 --> 35:40.116
Excuse me.

35:43.723 --> 35:45.054
Are those more samples?

35:45.625 --> 35:48.618
Yeah. Help yourself.

35:50.296 --> 35:51.456
Thanks.

35:52.532 --> 35:54.023
I got a job interview today.

35:54.301 --> 35:57.133
Oh, that's great. That's great.

36:00.641 --> 36:01.698
That's great.

36:04.545 --> 36:06.206
Hello, ladies!

36:08.716 --> 36:10.377
No samples today.

36:10.618 --> 36:12.882
What do you mean?
I got great stuff for you!

36:13.087 --> 36:15.214
No samples today, thank you.

36:16.123 --> 36:17.112
She's just a friend.

36:17.191 --> 36:18.624
No samples today. Sorry.

36:19.727 --> 36:21.058
Okay. What's going on?

36:22.062 --> 36:24.690
Trey got to you, didn't he?
What'd he give you?

36:24.965 --> 36:27.160
No samples today, thank you. Hawaii.

36:28.937 --> 36:29.995
Hawaii?

36:30.071 --> 36:34.201
No samples today. Doctor's convention.
Sand and surf in Honolulu.

36:35.577 --> 36:37.237
Wow. Okay.

36:39.047 --> 36:40.207
Okay.

36:46.821 --> 36:48.311
I got to get out of here.

36:48.590 --> 36:50.581
You're not going to go see her, are you?

36:51.259 --> 36:52.419
No.

36:53.129 --> 36:54.117
Mmm-hmm.

37:10.946 --> 37:12.105
Maggie!

37:13.349 --> 37:14.338
Hi.

37:14.717 --> 37:16.048
Hey, what's that?

37:16.285 --> 37:17.445
Food.

37:18.954 --> 37:20.945
- For?
- Eating.

37:21.490 --> 37:22.515
They're my noodles!

37:22.592 --> 37:23.922
You already
have a face full of noodles!

37:23.993 --> 37:24.982
Jesus!

37:25.294 --> 37:27.957
My God, you are so selfish.
You're just like my mother.

37:28.265 --> 37:30.095
Did you sleep with your mother?

37:30.166 --> 37:31.224
Ew!

37:31.300 --> 37:33.166
- What?
- You know what?

37:33.537 --> 37:36.130
She's cute, she's available, you'd love her.

37:36.372 --> 37:38.841
The only thing is, she happens to
take up all the oxygen in the room

37:38.909 --> 37:40.376
and hog all the closet space,
but other than that,

37:40.444 --> 37:41.569
you two are perfect for each other.

37:41.644 --> 37:44.205
Is she hotter than you?
I bet she's hotter than you.

37:44.581 --> 37:45.980
She doesn't have a disease, either.

37:46.450 --> 37:47.974
Does that work for you generally?

37:48.051 --> 37:49.814
- What?
- Self-pity.

37:50.721 --> 37:52.212
You are a shithead.

38:02.834 --> 38:03.994
What?

38:04.668 --> 38:05.999
Nothing.

38:11.174 --> 38:12.506
This is nice.

38:18.716 --> 38:21.845
Okay, I think it's time to
take off your clothes and jump me.

38:21.920 --> 38:24.444
Wait. Am I not allowed to say that?

38:25.089 --> 38:26.249
I don't know.

38:26.324 --> 38:30.852
First you bring food,
and then you wanna spend the night,

38:30.928 --> 38:31.953
and then you bring a change of clothes,

38:32.030 --> 38:34.793
and then you bring a razor and,
oh, my God, it's a relationship.

38:34.866 --> 38:35.958
I don't want a relationship.

38:36.033 --> 38:37.763
Well, you can't guarantee
that now, can you?

38:37.836 --> 38:39.895
You might actually have some kind of

38:39.972 --> 38:41.769
latent humanity that
you don't know anything about.

38:41.840 --> 38:44.331
You might like being
in a relationship, and...

38:44.409 --> 38:47.276
Listen, I said this was nice.
I didn't ask you to marry me.

38:50.949 --> 38:53.076
Well, I wouldn't want to be
with someone who was sick, either.

38:59.291 --> 39:00.622
I'm sorry.

39:02.295 --> 39:03.625
- Sorry.
- No.

39:03.695 --> 39:07.188
I just... I did that before,
and it didn't...

39:08.701 --> 39:09.792
It wasn't good.

39:13.406 --> 39:17.308
I'd just been diagnosed,

39:17.510 --> 39:19.307
and he was married.

39:20.313 --> 39:23.476
He helped me, and it didn't end well. So...

39:27.587 --> 39:28.781
It's Trey Hannigan, isn't it?

39:31.425 --> 39:34.086
- Trey Hannigan? It was Trey Hannigan.
- Yeah, well...

39:35.662 --> 39:36.994
Uh...

39:38.766 --> 39:39.857
Are you in love with him?

39:42.603 --> 39:45.093
No, I'm not in love with Trey Hannigan.

39:45.672 --> 39:47.265
I was never in love with Trey Hannigan.

39:47.474 --> 39:50.671
He was... Said he was in love with me.

39:55.082 --> 39:57.414
Which was, you know, a problem.

40:06.194 --> 40:08.059
- Can we just...
- Right, yeah.

40:08.196 --> 40:09.594
- Yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.

40:09.663 --> 40:10.961
- Please.
- Okay.

40:15.035 --> 40:17.971
You get a special thank you
for bringing food.

40:18.306 --> 40:19.466
I do?

40:19.808 --> 40:21.469
Yes, you do.

40:21.977 --> 40:22.966
Mmm.

40:23.812 --> 40:25.974
- You know what?
- What?

40:27.048 --> 40:28.072
What?

40:28.583 --> 40:29.914
I got to pee.

40:31.954 --> 40:33.511
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

40:55.978 --> 40:57.343
Just give me a second, okay?

40:57.513 --> 40:58.502
Okay.

41:16.500 --> 41:17.762
Mmm.

41:19.769 --> 41:21.431
Focus, focus, focus.

41:26.209 --> 41:27.198
Should I keep going?

41:27.377 --> 41:29.208
- This never happens.
- I'm aware.

41:29.546 --> 41:31.037
I'm serious. It doesn't.

41:31.248 --> 41:34.581
No, no, no. Don't worry about it.
It's me. I'm a jinx.

41:35.053 --> 41:36.281
That's really helpful.

41:36.354 --> 41:38.150
You know what? Why don't you
talk about all the other guys

41:38.221 --> 41:41.089
that you slept with that couldn't get it up,
'cause then it would really like...

41:41.159 --> 41:42.649
Shh! Shh! Shh!

41:43.894 --> 41:45.886
Just calm down.

41:47.231 --> 41:49.289
Just give me a minute.

41:51.235 --> 41:52.725
Don't worry about it.

41:52.804 --> 41:53.964
I am worried about it!

41:55.506 --> 41:59.340
Jesus! Can you just please...
Just show me a little kindness?

42:00.512 --> 42:01.671
Please.

42:02.313 --> 42:06.943
Oh, you lying sack of shit!
You do have latent humanity.

42:07.885 --> 42:11.617
- Do you know what's going on here?
- I just want to have sex.

42:12.857 --> 42:14.689
Well, your body's telling you otherwise.

42:15.828 --> 42:17.762
What is that supposed to mean?

42:20.232 --> 42:21.529
Sit up.

42:21.600 --> 42:23.830
- I don't want to sit up.
- Come on. Sit up. Sit up. Sit up. Come on.

42:26.438 --> 42:28.963
All right. Now talk to me.

42:29.441 --> 42:31.102
I don't want to talk.

42:31.176 --> 42:34.373
What else are we going to do?
You've taken sex off the table.

42:34.446 --> 42:35.573
Oh!

42:35.682 --> 42:38.343
Come on. Come on.
Tell me how your day was.

42:39.218 --> 42:40.516
- My day?
- Mmm-hmm.

42:41.454 --> 42:45.117
So I sneak up to my room and
I white out the "D" so it looks like a "B,"

42:45.225 --> 42:47.420
which I did flawlessly. It was undetectable.

42:47.827 --> 42:50.318
And I go down to his study
and I hand him the paper.

42:50.397 --> 42:52.422
And he gives me the face.

42:52.966 --> 42:54.866
And I'm like, "What?"

42:55.668 --> 42:56.692
Mmm-hmm.

42:56.803 --> 43:00.261
And then, from behind his back,
he pulls out the goddamn carbon copy

43:00.340 --> 43:02.331
- that the school sent home.
- Oh, no!

43:03.143 --> 43:04.941
- Yeah.
- Wow.

43:05.012 --> 43:06.672
Genius. Genius.

43:09.517 --> 43:11.643
- You're so competitive.
- No!

43:12.085 --> 43:15.055
Yeah! Yes, you are. Oh, my God, I tell you

43:15.122 --> 43:17.612
I'm involved with Trey Hannigan
and you can't get it up.

43:18.124 --> 43:19.558
I could give a shit about Trey Hannigan.

43:20.394 --> 43:22.328
All you care about is beating him!

43:22.396 --> 43:24.489
- Bullshit!
- You know, it's so prehistoric.

43:24.732 --> 43:26.927
All men care about is performance,

43:27.001 --> 43:28.628
but they have an appendage
that doesn't work

43:28.702 --> 43:31.102
if they're worried about performance.

43:31.605 --> 43:33.664
Mmm. Well, you're an expert, so...

43:38.646 --> 43:40.911
Okay. If I'm an expert,
then why is your company spending

43:40.981 --> 43:43.108
billions making a drug
so that guys can get it up?

43:43.184 --> 43:44.174
Oh, I wish.

43:44.419 --> 43:46.182
It's true. I read it.
Pfizer's making a fuck drug.

43:46.421 --> 43:48.251
Where'd you read that?

43:48.756 --> 43:50.019
I don't know. Ask your guys.

43:50.092 --> 43:53.151
I don't know where I read it.
I'm a drug slut. I read everything.

43:53.527 --> 43:54.961
- What drug?
- I don't know,

43:55.030 --> 43:56.361
but it's hard to believe, isn't it?

43:57.766 --> 43:59.700
It's hard to believe.

44:00.635 --> 44:02.660
- It's gonna be pretty huge, though.
- Oh!

44:03.271 --> 44:07.264
When I think of the size of the problem

44:07.542 --> 44:10.841
and that it's growing larger, really...

44:10.912 --> 44:12.777
- Really.
- I can't even imagine!

44:12.848 --> 44:14.077
You know what I think...

44:14.150 --> 44:15.515
To have found a solution
to the stiffest, hardest...

44:15.585 --> 44:16.573
Wow.

44:16.651 --> 44:20.144
- Pfizer must be swelling with pride.
- I'm gonna stop you.

44:20.323 --> 44:21.847
No tickling! Stop!

44:21.924 --> 44:24.119
Stop! No tickling! No, please!

44:24.193 --> 44:26.855
Don't tickle me just
because you have a limp sense of humor!

44:26.929 --> 44:27.918
Oh!

44:37.640 --> 44:38.835
Hello.

44:43.279 --> 44:44.747
Keep talking.

44:44.815 --> 44:46.406
No more talking.

45:01.665 --> 45:04.031
Who are all these old people?

45:04.735 --> 45:07.568
Uh... Just some people I work with.

45:09.073 --> 45:11.506
Wow. These are beautiful.

45:12.609 --> 45:14.043
It looks like a photograph.

45:14.412 --> 45:15.878
When did you do this?

45:17.047 --> 45:18.036
Uh...

45:19.751 --> 45:22.048
Back when I could hold a brush.

45:22.953 --> 45:24.785
Here's your breakfast.

45:27.624 --> 45:29.388
- Thanks.
- Yeah, well...

45:33.865 --> 45:35.662
I'll call you.

45:37.335 --> 45:38.963
- Don't.
- I will.

45:39.537 --> 45:40.526
I'm not kidding.

45:44.743 --> 45:47.677
I can't do this.

45:50.783 --> 45:52.808
I told you.

46:00.926 --> 46:02.689
Okay, then.

46:02.761 --> 46:04.888
See you.

46:12.338 --> 46:14.170
Your problem is
you don't know how to close!

46:14.241 --> 46:16.606
You gotta tell the docs what they need.

46:16.675 --> 46:17.904
Somebody says no,
that's when the fun starts.

46:17.978 --> 46:18.967
That means you are in.

46:19.045 --> 46:21.376
- My numbers are up.
- Your Zithromax is up. Big deal.

46:21.447 --> 46:23.439
We're not going to Chicago on Zithromax.

46:23.516 --> 46:25.780
Depressed people, Randall,
they're depressed every day.

46:25.852 --> 46:26.840
You gotta move Zoloft.

46:26.919 --> 46:29.514
- I want you to focus on Zoloft.
- Zoloft.

46:29.589 --> 46:33.150
Counseling? Here's some counseling.
Stop being a fucking bitch.

46:33.226 --> 46:34.955
Wait, did I use "you" language?

46:35.028 --> 46:36.086
Trial separation.

46:36.162 --> 46:39.029
I'm so sorry. I need to own my feelings.

46:39.099 --> 46:40.123
Fucking pepperoni.

46:40.200 --> 46:41.189
Let me rephrase that.

46:41.268 --> 46:44.328
I feel that you should stop
being a fucking bitch!

46:46.473 --> 46:48.806
So, I hear we're coming out
with a new sex drug.

46:49.143 --> 46:51.201
- What are you talking about?
- Is it true?

46:51.278 --> 46:54.112
- Where did you hear that?
- Heard it around.

46:54.181 --> 46:57.172
Sildenafil citrate. It's a PDE-5 inhibitor.

46:57.251 --> 46:59.742
They lucked into it during trials
for blood pressure medication.

46:59.820 --> 47:02.948
Guys had massive boners the whole time.
Where did you hear that?

47:03.024 --> 47:04.616
- What's it called?
- Viagra.

47:04.692 --> 47:06.455
- I want it.
- Everybody wants it.

47:06.527 --> 47:07.516
I could sell the shit out of it.

47:07.595 --> 47:10.120
Can you see if there's some Tums
in there for me in the glove compartment?

47:10.197 --> 47:11.562
- Bruce.
- Tums me, buddy.

47:11.632 --> 47:12.827
Bruce.

47:12.901 --> 47:15.334
Bruce. I want that account.

47:15.936 --> 47:17.370
Why would I give it to you?

47:17.439 --> 47:20.134
Who can sell a dick drug better than me?

47:20.808 --> 47:23.243
Ten years, Jamie,
ten excruciating years of marriage.

47:23.312 --> 47:24.939
It's like the lost decade.

47:25.013 --> 47:26.912
Oh, my God!

47:26.982 --> 47:29.280
I don't even know
how to hit on women anymore.

47:29.351 --> 47:30.375
What do you do? What's your game?

47:30.452 --> 47:31.782
You need an IBS.
Do you know what that is?

47:31.852 --> 47:32.877
Irritable Bowel Syndrome?

47:32.954 --> 47:33.943
An Initial Benefit Statement.

47:34.022 --> 47:36.252
Tell them who you are, why you're there
and what you can do for them.

47:36.325 --> 47:37.314
All right? And just be yourself, Josh.

47:37.392 --> 47:38.984
- You'll be fine.
- Thank you very much.

47:39.227 --> 47:41.195
Oh! Look who just walked in.

47:42.432 --> 47:44.194
Now's your chance, "Closer. "

47:44.266 --> 47:45.290
Show me what you got.

47:48.438 --> 47:49.426
Show me.

47:49.771 --> 47:52.297
Hey! Pfizer, how's your fist?

47:52.375 --> 47:53.364
How's your jaw?

47:54.843 --> 47:56.538
Randall, you know Stan Knight, right?

47:56.611 --> 47:59.137
Stan, this is a bright young man
from Pfizer.

47:59.215 --> 48:00.409
Yes, we've met.

48:00.483 --> 48:01.643
- Yeah. How you doing?
- Fantastic.

48:01.718 --> 48:04.482
New study on Zoloft,
25% fewer side effects than Prozac.

48:04.554 --> 48:06.385
So, I'm feeling good.

48:06.456 --> 48:08.287
You'd do better selling him
if you got him laid.

48:08.358 --> 48:09.689
Can you get me laid?

48:10.693 --> 48:13.389
Stan's one of the more respected
diagnosticians in town,

48:13.463 --> 48:15.055
but his real calling is pussy-hound.

48:15.131 --> 48:17.191
Yes, and I think your real calling is pimp.

48:17.701 --> 48:19.861
Now, you're banging Maggie Murdock,
aren't you?

48:20.536 --> 48:21.561
Are.

48:21.638 --> 48:22.696
You are.

48:22.773 --> 48:25.332
Oh, God, those tits are unbelievable!

48:25.408 --> 48:26.876
- So not fair!
- All right.

48:26.944 --> 48:30.435
No, no. You don't see that a lot
in the neurologically damned.

48:30.513 --> 48:32.709
What do you mean, "damned"?
You don't die from Parkinson's.

48:32.783 --> 48:34.580
Well, it's not much of a life, now is it?

48:34.651 --> 48:36.242
What do you mean? Interferon, L-dopa...

48:36.319 --> 48:37.878
It slowed the progress
in the majority of cases.

48:37.955 --> 48:39.252
Listen, Dr. Drug Rep.

48:39.323 --> 48:41.656
You know less than shit, okay?
She's a sick girl.

48:41.726 --> 48:43.625
Oh. Is that what you told your wife?

48:43.694 --> 48:44.956
That's none of your fucking business.

48:45.028 --> 48:46.690
Maggie has all sorts of needs,

48:46.765 --> 48:48.629
and I don't think a pussy like you
is up for the job.

48:48.699 --> 48:49.757
Right, and a married man is?

48:49.833 --> 48:51.426
- Whoa, whoa!
- You really want me to hit you again?

48:52.337 --> 48:54.804
Chill out, man! Chill.
Wait! Don't get aggressive.

48:54.872 --> 48:56.500
Don't get aggressive. Hey!

48:56.574 --> 48:58.633
Whoa! Baby, okay. It's okay.

48:58.710 --> 49:00.199
Inter-fucking-feron, really?

49:00.277 --> 49:01.472
- You know what?
- Hey.

49:01.546 --> 49:02.535
Easy, easy.

49:02.614 --> 49:04.241
- I'm going home.
- No, you're not.

49:04.315 --> 49:07.910
- No, no, no. I'm going home.
- Good. Say hi to your wife.

49:07.986 --> 49:09.078
I'm keeping my eyes on you, buddy.

49:10.688 --> 49:12.451
That freaked me out.

49:13.858 --> 49:16.453
He actually, physically hit you, didn't he?

49:16.529 --> 49:18.689
Yeah, he did, and I was afraid
he was going to do it again.

49:18.763 --> 49:20.788
He might have to up his meds,
that young man.

49:20.899 --> 49:23.459
Or maybe he needs to change to
a drug that's proven more effective

49:23.535 --> 49:25.366
in controlling aggressive behavior.

49:25.437 --> 49:31.206
Zoloft produced 13% fewer outbursts
in a controlled study of adult males.

49:31.544 --> 49:33.273
And I think it's...

49:33.345 --> 49:34.403
Turn to your left.

49:34.480 --> 49:36.277
Turn to your left right now.
Turn to your left.

49:37.049 --> 49:38.482
Those two women, I know both of them.

49:38.551 --> 49:40.212
Which one do you want to take home?

49:42.855 --> 49:46.383
You're a superstar. Confidence is king.

49:47.226 --> 49:51.288
Hey. What do you say we blow this joint,
and then each other?

49:52.466 --> 49:53.591
Okay.

49:54.400 --> 49:55.732
Thank you.

49:58.338 --> 49:59.599
We ready?

49:59.672 --> 50:01.300
- You okay, champ?
- No.

50:06.146 --> 50:07.636
What are you doing? Are you calling her?

50:10.584 --> 50:12.552
Hey, did she go down on you?

50:12.619 --> 50:15.110
Farrah looks at my dick
like it's the Eye of Sauron.

50:17.257 --> 50:18.246
Hello?

50:18.758 --> 50:20.089
Did you call me?

50:20.327 --> 50:22.091
No. I did not call you.

50:22.429 --> 50:24.090
I think you did.

50:24.331 --> 50:26.232
And what would I have said
if I had called you?

50:26.767 --> 50:28.165
That you want to see me?

50:28.602 --> 50:31.834
Well, that would be nice,
except I didn't call you.

50:31.906 --> 50:32.930
Do you want to see me?

50:33.007 --> 50:34.200
I'm hanging up now.

50:34.274 --> 50:37.608
No. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Don't hang up. Don't hang up.

50:40.314 --> 50:41.303
Why?

50:43.718 --> 50:46.243
I like hearing the sound of your voice.

50:52.693 --> 50:53.887
Bye, Randall.

50:53.961 --> 50:55.224
Maggie!

50:59.000 --> 51:02.732
You like hearing the sound of her voice?

51:02.804 --> 51:04.361
Shut up.

51:04.438 --> 51:07.704
Do you have a brain tumor?
Were you molested by a Care Bear?

51:07.809 --> 51:09.605
Were you abducted by aliens?

51:09.677 --> 51:10.702
You hate women.

51:10.779 --> 51:13.247
Why else would you
screw so many of them?

51:13.315 --> 51:15.545
It's time for you to overdose.

51:15.784 --> 51:17.411
Oh! Oh!

51:17.519 --> 51:19.282
Oh, she rejected you!

51:19.354 --> 51:21.118
That's why you want her.

51:21.190 --> 51:23.214
It's the first time in history
that's ever happened.

51:23.292 --> 51:24.520
Excuse me. Excuse me.

51:24.593 --> 51:26.494
I was wondering something.
Aren't you rich?

51:26.563 --> 51:28.689
Why are you sleeping on my couch?

51:31.000 --> 51:32.365
You're my big brother.

51:36.005 --> 51:36.994
Here.

51:37.540 --> 51:40.600
For people who never entered puberty.
Take six.

51:42.946 --> 51:43.935
All right.

51:45.348 --> 51:47.839
- You all right?
- Can I pay by check?

51:47.917 --> 51:51.284
Sam, remember I told you
that the pharmacies only take cash?

51:51.354 --> 51:53.254
Maggie! Mag!

51:54.090 --> 51:55.786
Um... But, listen,
why don't you just get on the bus,

51:55.859 --> 51:57.325
we'll work it out there.
Okay? All right. Good.

51:57.393 --> 51:58.917
Maggie, I want to talk to you.

51:58.995 --> 52:00.861
I can't talk right now, all right?

52:00.931 --> 52:02.795
- I'm getting on a bus to Canada.
- Canada?

52:02.865 --> 52:04.025
Yes. Yes, Canada.

52:04.100 --> 52:06.069
These people can't afford
to pay for their prescriptions here.

52:06.136 --> 52:07.967
Maggie, will we have bathroom breaks?

52:08.038 --> 52:10.370
Sophie, remember I told you
that there's a bathroom on the bus?

52:10.441 --> 52:12.375
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's go.

52:12.443 --> 52:14.707
- Okay. When do you get back?
- Never.

52:15.579 --> 52:17.911
- Tomorrow night, late.
- How late?

52:17.982 --> 52:21.941
Just forget about it, okay? Please?
I'm begging you.

52:29.361 --> 52:30.453
Why don't you take a pen?

52:30.528 --> 52:32.461
I'll send you a pamphlet
and an efficacy statement, okay?

52:32.529 --> 52:34.521
What time is it, do you know?

52:34.633 --> 52:37.534
Wow. Okay, I got to go.
I'll give you a call, okay?

52:39.169 --> 52:43.607
We've come a long, long way together

52:43.675 --> 52:47.202
Through the hard times and the good

52:47.912 --> 52:52.110
I have to celebrate you, baby

52:52.183 --> 52:56.950
I have to praise you like I should

53:00.192 --> 53:01.420
...know.

53:01.494 --> 53:04.520
Know how to handle large sums of money

53:04.597 --> 53:06.531
with harmony and with love,

53:06.599 --> 53:09.932
and that the truth is
that you have high ideals,

53:10.002 --> 53:13.437
and that you are a person
of great personal integrity,

53:13.505 --> 53:17.806
and you will keep your mind focused
upon financial prosperity.

53:32.391 --> 53:35.327
Looks like you got
all your stuff, right? Okay. Good.

53:35.395 --> 53:38.056
- You guys travel home safe.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

53:38.130 --> 53:39.621
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

53:39.966 --> 53:42.298
- Bye, Maggie!
- Bye.

54:03.991 --> 54:05.219
Hi.

54:07.160 --> 54:09.652
When you end it, I get to hate you,

54:09.731 --> 54:12.858
and act all cold,
and tell embarrassing stuff to my friends.

54:13.133 --> 54:14.123
Okay.

54:14.202 --> 54:15.931
And you don't get to move in,

54:16.003 --> 54:19.063
or become friends with my friends,
or introduce me to your parents.

54:19.140 --> 54:21.074
This is what this is, whatever this is.

54:21.142 --> 54:22.166
Are you done?

54:22.677 --> 54:23.975
Have you been here all night?

54:24.046 --> 54:25.410
Yes.

54:30.351 --> 54:32.012
Oh, Christ!

54:36.257 --> 54:38.385
Why am I mad at you already?

55:17.432 --> 55:20.664
Oh, Jamie. It's Brucie.
You want to meet me?

55:20.737 --> 55:24.070
I've got a load of love in my trunk for you.
Something you're going to like.

55:24.140 --> 55:25.539
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

55:25.608 --> 55:27.975
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.
Call me, call me, call me.

55:28.045 --> 55:29.272
You're gonna love me, love me...

55:32.182 --> 55:33.172
Ah!

55:33.751 --> 55:36.014
Jamie, it's Bruce. Where are you?

55:36.085 --> 55:37.484
Who are you?

55:40.858 --> 55:43.622
Let the games begin!

55:48.766 --> 55:51.792
Make it hot! Make it hot!

55:51.869 --> 55:54.030
Ooh, baby, do you know
what that's worth?

55:54.104 --> 55:56.834
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

55:56.907 --> 55:59.432
Men with diabetes,
men with prostate cancer,

55:59.510 --> 56:01.410
men with massive penile injuries.

56:01.478 --> 56:05.346
Men with performance anxiety,
men with any common form of impotence

56:05.416 --> 56:07.008
or sexual dysfunction.

56:07.084 --> 56:09.781
Men without a useful erection in years!

56:09.988 --> 56:11.682
Boing!

56:11.755 --> 56:15.192
Minimum side effects, long-term safety.
This isn't a pill.

56:15.260 --> 56:18.195
This is a revolution. Questions?

56:18.263 --> 56:19.662
Yeah. Where are the samples?

56:19.731 --> 56:21.665
Right here, baby. Right here.

56:21.733 --> 56:24.531
You sure you want one? You want two?
Who wants two?

56:24.603 --> 56:28.266
Did you see this? Bob Dole says
his TV commercials for Viagra

56:28.340 --> 56:31.138
won't hurt his wife's campaign
for President.

56:31.209 --> 56:32.939
He also says the Viagra commercials

56:33.012 --> 56:36.538
won't hurt his campaign
to nail Heather Locklear.

56:36.615 --> 56:39.016
The dick drug! That's my brother's!

56:39.352 --> 56:42.213
Oh, my God!

56:42.288 --> 56:47.419
Viagra, the little pill that has started
a gold rush for its manufacturer,

56:47.493 --> 56:49.154
the drug giant Pfizer.

56:50.630 --> 56:53.292
Jamie! Jamie! Hey!

56:53.633 --> 56:55.794
- Ted Goldstein, ENT.
- Oh, Ted, hi. How are you?

56:55.868 --> 56:58.735
I'm good. Look, I got this friend,
he's a radiologist.

56:58.804 --> 57:00.931
He has a little problem. I thought maybe...

57:01.007 --> 57:02.407
Say no more.

57:03.410 --> 57:04.467
You're a gem.

57:04.543 --> 57:07.308
Viagra is the first-ever pill
to treat impotence.

57:07.381 --> 57:10.543
It's easy, it's effective,
and it's now wildly in demand.

57:13.654 --> 57:15.587
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

57:15.655 --> 57:17.453
Oncologists are writing it,
shrinks are writing it,

57:17.524 --> 57:19.321
gastroenterologists are writing it.

57:19.393 --> 57:21.485
Pediatricians are writing it for themselves!

57:21.995 --> 57:23.758
I mean, pharmacies could
stay open 24 hours

57:23.830 --> 57:24.990
and they still couldn't meet the demand.

57:25.065 --> 57:26.829
We're running 1,200 prescriptions a month.

57:26.901 --> 57:29.835
That's more than my entire year's quota!
And you don't care.

57:29.903 --> 57:33.339
About a bunch of old guys
with stiffies? Nope.

57:33.407 --> 57:34.999
How can you be so callous?

57:35.075 --> 57:38.341
Men are suffering worldwide
from shame and...

57:43.851 --> 57:45.909
And frustration.

57:51.191 --> 57:53.820
Oh, you're my little blue pill.

57:55.496 --> 57:56.827
Oh, for God's sake.

57:56.898 --> 57:59.025
No. What about this do you think is okay?

57:59.100 --> 58:02.161
What are you...
I don't want to see this! No.

58:02.237 --> 58:03.567
What the fuck are you doing?

58:03.638 --> 58:06.369
- No, no, no! This is too much information.
- I just need this.

58:06.442 --> 58:08.705
Are you fucking filming it?

58:09.277 --> 58:10.767
Do you do, like, close-ups and shit?

58:13.549 --> 58:15.038
Who holds it?

58:26.628 --> 58:27.617
Hey.

58:30.566 --> 58:31.795
Wake up.

58:31.868 --> 58:33.266
Oh!

58:34.336 --> 58:35.325
Again?

58:40.609 --> 58:41.599
Maggie!

58:43.346 --> 58:47.009
Come on. I'm an artist. This is work.

58:48.418 --> 58:49.850
Oh, my God.

58:49.918 --> 58:51.409
Say something.

58:54.124 --> 58:55.318
You're just too weird.

58:55.392 --> 58:56.552
Yeah, well...

58:59.429 --> 59:02.557
Hi, there. Jamie Randall here.

59:03.266 --> 59:08.329
Just reporting from bed,
having just fucked my girlfriend.

59:08.905 --> 59:10.702
- And...
- Don't use that word.

59:10.775 --> 59:13.039
What? You use "fuck" all the time.

59:13.110 --> 59:15.304
No, not "fucking. " "Girlfriend. "

59:16.614 --> 59:17.945
That's what you are.

59:22.386 --> 59:23.444
I am?

59:24.488 --> 59:26.080
Yeah, you are.

59:28.459 --> 59:30.256
I guess I am.

59:34.131 --> 59:35.793
Jesus.

59:52.451 --> 59:56.114
I lived in a place called Okfuskee

59:57.355 --> 01:00:00.984
And I had a little girl in a holler tree

01:00:02.661 --> 01:00:06.529
I said, "Little girl it's plain to see

01:00:07.899 --> 01:00:10.767
"Ain't nobody that can sing like me

01:00:10.837 --> 01:00:14.033
"Ain't nobody that can sing like me "

01:00:18.077 --> 01:00:22.207
She said it's hard for me to see

01:00:23.249 --> 01:00:26.844
How one little boy got so ugly

01:00:28.654 --> 01:00:32.021
Yes, my little girly that might be

01:00:33.159 --> 01:00:36.424
But there ain't nobody
that can sing like me

01:00:36.496 --> 01:00:39.363
Ain't nobody that can sing like me

01:00:41.335 --> 01:00:42.767
Way over yonder in the minor key

01:00:46.073 --> 01:00:48.540
Way over yonder in the minor key

01:00:48.608 --> 01:00:49.666
No, Mom.

01:00:49.742 --> 01:00:53.838
No, it's not an aphrodisiac.
It's a vasodilator.

01:00:53.913 --> 01:00:56.542
A vasodilator. No, Ma...

01:00:57.985 --> 01:01:00.146
No, just... No, I...

01:01:00.888 --> 01:01:03.516
Yeah, I've already sold
2,000 prescriptions this month alone.

01:01:04.124 --> 01:01:05.114
It's a lot of money.

01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:10.588
Okay, I really can't talk.
Maggie needs me.

01:01:10.665 --> 01:01:11.824
Okay, bye.

01:01:13.634 --> 01:01:16.570
I thought you said
it was 1,200 prescriptions.

01:01:17.938 --> 01:01:18.927
It is.

01:01:21.509 --> 01:01:23.601
Well, why did you tell her 2,000?

01:01:24.545 --> 01:01:25.535
Did I?

01:01:28.249 --> 01:01:29.306
Are you kidding?

01:01:30.485 --> 01:01:32.077
I don't know, it just sounded better.

01:01:34.757 --> 01:01:36.917
You told your mother a lie
because it sounds better?

01:01:36.991 --> 01:01:40.860
Look, she doesn't know numbers.

01:01:40.929 --> 01:01:43.261
Do you tell me lies
because they sound better?

01:01:43.498 --> 01:01:44.557
No!

01:01:44.633 --> 01:01:45.622
Well, why did you do it with her?

01:01:45.701 --> 01:01:47.725
Because she wants to
know that I'm doing well...

01:01:47.802 --> 01:01:49.360
Okay, but you are doing well,

01:01:49.438 --> 01:01:51.429
so why do you need
to make it sound better?

01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:53.701
Okay, you know what?

01:01:53.775 --> 01:01:56.574
I will call her back up right now,
and I will correct my mistake.

01:01:56.645 --> 01:01:57.771
Okay?

01:02:01.283 --> 01:02:03.183
Tell me four good things about yourself.

01:02:05.454 --> 01:02:06.648
Excuse me?

01:02:07.489 --> 01:02:08.478
You heard me.

01:02:10.093 --> 01:02:11.491
Okay.

01:02:12.528 --> 01:02:15.293
Four good things about myself.

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:17.792
I can...

01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:21.598
Why are we doing this?

01:02:21.671 --> 01:02:23.194
This is just... I don't...

01:02:23.272 --> 01:02:25.707
You can't even think
of four good things about yourself.

01:02:25.775 --> 01:02:26.799
What? I totally can!

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:28.308
Do you think that you're generous?

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:31.805
Do you think you're sweet?

01:02:34.985 --> 01:02:36.145
Not particularly.

01:02:36.219 --> 01:02:37.516
Do you think that you're smart?

01:02:38.655 --> 01:02:40.486
Oh, my God!

01:02:42.492 --> 01:02:43.983
Look at you.

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:48.661
You're this

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:50.990
talented,

01:02:53.336 --> 01:02:58.103
charming, handsome, capable,
determined, smart man.

01:03:03.514 --> 01:03:04.845
I am?

01:03:07.018 --> 01:03:08.485
Yes, you are.

01:03:17.695 --> 01:03:18.685
I can juggle.

01:03:23.367 --> 01:03:25.700
- Does it make it longer?
- Time or inches?

01:03:25.771 --> 01:03:28.136
- How come we can't take it?
- You can.

01:03:28.205 --> 01:03:30.140
Are you saying
that we can get hard?

01:03:30.208 --> 01:03:32.699
There is some indication
of increased lubrication.

01:03:34.613 --> 01:03:37.343
- If they come inside you, does it burn?
- No.

01:03:37.416 --> 01:03:39.407
How about in your mouth?

01:03:40.218 --> 01:03:42.379
Jamie, we want more Viagra!

01:03:42.454 --> 01:03:44.320
- More! More Viagra!
- More Viagra!

01:03:46.391 --> 01:03:48.860
Stan! Come here. Come over here!

01:03:48.928 --> 01:03:52.829
Ladies, this is Dr. Stan Knight,
king of all internists.

01:03:52.898 --> 01:03:54.662
Right? And this is...

01:03:54.734 --> 01:03:56.326
Cassie.

01:03:56.402 --> 01:03:58.563
But my friends call me Lisa.

01:03:59.505 --> 01:04:01.735
Lisa wants to marry a doctor, so good luck.

01:04:01.808 --> 01:04:03.138
Oh, dear.

01:04:03.209 --> 01:04:05.302
Ladies, next round is on me! Okay?

01:04:07.747 --> 01:04:09.374
Nice jacket, man.

01:04:36.443 --> 01:04:38.070
Did you get laid?

01:04:38.445 --> 01:04:39.605
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:41.741
- Six times.
- Mmm.

01:04:42.182 --> 01:04:44.275
I was scared that you were.

01:04:46.019 --> 01:04:47.486
You're crazy.

01:05:03.138 --> 01:05:04.127
What?

01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:06.198
Is everything okay?

01:05:06.808 --> 01:05:08.969
Jamie... Honey?

01:05:09.477 --> 01:05:11.877
- Honey, your heart's beating really fast.
- I know.

01:05:12.147 --> 01:05:13.308
What's...

01:05:14.048 --> 01:05:16.516
Jamie. Jamie. Jamie. Jamie.

01:05:17.686 --> 01:05:19.516
Jamie. It's okay. It's okay.

01:05:19.587 --> 01:05:20.611
Talk to me.

01:05:21.489 --> 01:05:22.478
I...

01:05:23.159 --> 01:05:24.148
I...

01:05:24.393 --> 01:05:27.122
Okay, you know what? Just breathe.
Don't even worry about it.

01:05:27.195 --> 01:05:28.595
Just breathe.

01:05:28.998 --> 01:05:30.659
It's okay.

01:05:32.066 --> 01:05:33.125
I...

01:05:35.971 --> 01:05:37.802
- I love you.
- What?

01:05:40.609 --> 01:05:42.008
Just give me a second, okay?

01:05:42.846 --> 01:05:44.176
Oh, God, I do.

01:05:45.881 --> 01:05:46.870
Uh...

01:05:47.350 --> 01:05:49.010
- No, you don't.
- Don't touch me!

01:05:49.084 --> 01:05:50.415
Okay.
Do you want a glass of water?

01:05:50.486 --> 01:05:51.475
I'm sorry.

01:05:51.554 --> 01:05:53.546
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine. It's fine.

01:05:53.623 --> 01:05:55.317
- A little water?
- Yeah, water.

01:05:57.159 --> 01:05:58.149
Oh, yeah.

01:05:59.162 --> 01:06:01.823
Okay, see? Here you go. Here you go.

01:06:02.933 --> 01:06:03.991
Okay.

01:06:10.073 --> 01:06:12.269
- I love you. I can't stop saying it.
- You don't...

01:06:12.343 --> 01:06:15.607
- Just stop saying that, okay?
- I can't. I love you.

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:17.670
You don't understand.

01:06:18.815 --> 01:06:20.612
I've never said that to anyone before.

01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:24.944
- You've never said "I love you"?
- No.

01:06:26.356 --> 01:06:27.688
You never said it to your parents?

01:06:31.261 --> 01:06:32.286
No.

01:06:32.363 --> 01:06:34.126
- You never said it to your brother?
- Ugh!

01:06:34.365 --> 01:06:36.264
Jesus, you're more fucked up than I am.

01:06:38.102 --> 01:06:40.070
I once said it to a cat.

01:06:42.373 --> 01:06:44.864
- Okay, that makes me feel better.
- It does? Okay, good.

01:06:44.942 --> 01:06:46.705
You can hold me now.

01:06:47.246 --> 01:06:48.303
Okay.

01:06:56.387 --> 01:06:57.377
Oh!

01:06:59.558 --> 01:07:00.751
Joshie!

01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:08.222
That is disgusting.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:11.665
Jamie, I didn't know
you were coming home!

01:07:12.771 --> 01:07:14.102
Oh!

01:07:16.776 --> 01:07:18.174
Hey.

01:07:18.243 --> 01:07:21.440
Listen, it's not what it looks like, okay?

01:07:21.514 --> 01:07:23.038
Well, it kind of is, but...

01:07:23.116 --> 01:07:24.412
Okay, just chill.

01:07:24.483 --> 01:07:25.882
Yeah, chill. Oh, I'm sorry,

01:07:25.951 --> 01:07:28.648
I thought I just caught my brother
masturbating while watching me have sex.

01:07:29.154 --> 01:07:31.247
Well, I was focusing on her.

01:07:31.491 --> 01:07:32.651
Oh, "her. "

01:07:32.759 --> 01:07:34.750
- You mean my girlfriend! I'm sorry.
- No.

01:07:34.827 --> 01:07:36.590
Not on her!

01:07:36.663 --> 01:07:39.962
On her body parts!
Does video make everything look bigger?

01:07:40.033 --> 01:07:42.467
Because I didn't think
her tits were that big.

01:07:42.535 --> 01:07:44.025
Then I saw you,

01:07:44.103 --> 01:07:46.698
and I was like, "What,
did an anaconda get loose on the bed?"

01:07:46.774 --> 01:07:47.797
This is so twisted.

01:07:47.907 --> 01:07:50.808
Do you think Dad's big?
I mean, he was when we were kids,

01:07:50.877 --> 01:07:54.608
but then everything's bigger
when you're a kid, right?

01:07:55.949 --> 01:07:58.111
Fine! Okay? Sorry!

01:07:58.452 --> 01:07:59.543
My self-esteem would prefer

01:07:59.619 --> 01:08:03.021
that you not have a bigger penis
than me right now, that's all!

01:08:03.090 --> 01:08:04.556
Shh! Shh!

01:08:06.794 --> 01:08:08.261
Don't be mad.

01:08:12.032 --> 01:08:14.296
Run, Josh. Run, Josh.

01:08:14.368 --> 01:08:15.767
Run, Joshie.

01:08:15.836 --> 01:08:19.533
We can talk about this like men!
Ow! You're gonna ruin the tape!

01:08:20.374 --> 01:08:23.741
No normal human being
can possibly fit in this back seat.

01:08:23.810 --> 01:08:25.403
That definition excludes you, Josh.

01:08:25.479 --> 01:08:28.470
I'd literally be more comfortable
in the back of a Hot Wheels right now.

01:08:28.749 --> 01:08:31.116
I've lost all feeling in my legs.

01:08:33.921 --> 01:08:35.411
- Are you okay?
- No!

01:08:35.488 --> 01:08:37.651
I'm not talking to you, Josh.

01:08:38.393 --> 01:08:39.826
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

01:08:39.894 --> 01:08:41.054
Okay.

01:10:17.228 --> 01:10:18.354
He's waiting for you.

01:10:18.429 --> 01:10:21.262
- So, how are you doing?
- Fine. How's Maggie?

01:10:25.437 --> 01:10:26.664
Come in!

01:10:27.705 --> 01:10:29.229
- Whoa!
- No, come in, come in.

01:10:33.644 --> 01:10:34.805
Testosterone, man.

01:10:35.114 --> 01:10:38.742
Chicago's in two days. I must prepare.

01:10:39.517 --> 01:10:42.146
It's a fucking orgy
masquerading as a medical convention.

01:10:42.221 --> 01:10:44.415
- You're coming, aren't you?
- I don't know.

01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:47.652
- Oh, right. How's she doing?
- She's great.

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:49.791
Well, I'm not. I need a break.

01:10:50.195 --> 01:10:52.129
HMOs are killing me. Killing me!

01:10:52.197 --> 01:10:55.860
I need a lot of loosely moraled women
to throw themselves at me. Hard.

01:10:56.135 --> 01:10:57.932
Speaking of which...

01:10:58.971 --> 01:11:01.338
Oh, you are a god! You're a god, sir!

01:11:01.407 --> 01:11:02.634
You're really not coming to this?

01:11:02.708 --> 01:11:04.039
You could do something for me.

01:11:04.443 --> 01:11:05.433
Yeah, what's that?

01:11:05.712 --> 01:11:07.975
You could start prescribing Zoloft
instead of Prozac.

01:11:09.214 --> 01:11:10.341
Um...

01:11:11.718 --> 01:11:13.708
Well, Trey's a friend of mine, man.

01:11:15.155 --> 01:11:16.645
I know. I know.

01:11:18.792 --> 01:11:23.388
- Sure. Zoloft. Okay. Why not?
- Great.

01:11:27.367 --> 01:11:29.198
- Hey!
- Hey.

01:11:31.237 --> 01:11:33.068
How was your day?

01:11:33.339 --> 01:11:34.671
Amazing.

01:11:36.076 --> 01:11:37.064
Mmm?

01:11:38.511 --> 01:11:39.843
You?

01:11:39.914 --> 01:11:42.109
Me? My day was...

01:11:42.183 --> 01:11:43.843
My day was swell.

01:11:45.186 --> 01:11:48.178
- I went to the clinic...
- You did?

01:11:48.255 --> 01:11:50.189
...for a scrip

01:11:51.525 --> 01:11:56.053
and waited for three hours sitting next
to a man with a fork stuck in his head.

01:11:56.564 --> 01:11:57.758
- What?
- Yep.

01:11:57.832 --> 01:12:03.202
And then I went
to the pharmacy to get the scrip filled.

01:12:04.873 --> 01:12:07.534
Which was closed,

01:12:08.876 --> 01:12:11.107
so no meds for Maggie.

01:12:19.187 --> 01:12:20.211
Are you okay?

01:12:23.124 --> 01:12:24.682
Why, do I look like shit?

01:12:24.759 --> 01:12:26.056
- I didn't say that.
- Yeah.

01:12:26.127 --> 01:12:29.256
You didn't say. You didn't say it out loud.

01:12:37.806 --> 01:12:39.138
Thanks, I'd love one.

01:12:42.577 --> 01:12:43.909
Sorry.

01:12:48.483 --> 01:12:50.850
You think maybe you've had enough?

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:53.583
Nope, I don't, but you do.

01:12:54.257 --> 01:12:55.246
Excuse me?

01:12:55.825 --> 01:12:58.761
Tell me, Randall, what exactly is it
about me that's so desirable?

01:12:58.996 --> 01:13:02.590
There's going to be 600 girls
dying to blow you at this convention.

01:13:02.832 --> 01:13:04.994
- Well, I'm not going to the convention.
- Why not?

01:13:05.135 --> 01:13:11.301
Go out with some sexy, limber
ex-cheerleader from Alabama,

01:13:11.674 --> 01:13:15.167
who's just dying to discuss
market projections and sales techniques.

01:13:15.612 --> 01:13:19.605
Or just a hot HMO administrator
who likes to bake cookies

01:13:19.683 --> 01:13:23.175
and rub your head
while you discuss the evils of generics.

01:13:23.453 --> 01:13:25.546
Or just, you know, I don't know,
a normal person,

01:13:25.622 --> 01:13:29.024
who has energy and likes to do things
and have fun!

01:13:29.093 --> 01:13:30.081
I happen to want you.

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:33.892
Why? Why? What are you trying to prove?

01:13:34.365 --> 01:13:36.730
Are you trying to show
that you're not a flake?

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:40.964
Are you trying to stick with something
for once in your goddamn life?

01:13:41.038 --> 01:13:43.473
I mean, you do realize
that you are not a good person

01:13:43.541 --> 01:13:45.532
because you pity-fuck the sick girl, right?

01:13:58.557 --> 01:14:01.616
I almost went home with
someone from the clinic today.

01:14:01.826 --> 01:14:02.987
All right.

01:14:04.662 --> 01:14:06.323
- There, you see?
- All right.

01:14:07.498 --> 01:14:09.330
Don't forget your pager.

01:14:47.707 --> 01:14:49.436
Come with me to Chicago.

01:14:56.383 --> 01:14:58.578
- Keith! How you doing, man?
- Jamie. Good.

01:14:58.651 --> 01:15:00.812
So good to see you.
Everything going well?

01:15:01.054 --> 01:15:04.387
I'm going to go off and do some girly thing,
whatever that is.

01:15:04.724 --> 01:15:07.056
- How will I reach you?
- I'll beep you.

01:15:09.896 --> 01:15:10.885
Stage One?

01:15:11.965 --> 01:15:13.058
I'm sorry?

01:15:13.134 --> 01:15:14.567
My son's a Stage Three.

01:15:15.069 --> 01:15:16.797
It's not obvious, don't worry.

01:15:18.139 --> 01:15:19.470
We're across the street.

01:15:20.775 --> 01:15:24.438
Whenever you get tired of this bullshit
and want to hear what's really going on...

01:15:25.079 --> 01:15:26.740
Thank you.

01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:37.922
Fuck soup.

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.990
Fuck shoelaces.

01:15:40.261 --> 01:15:42.992
Fuck jewelry. And fuck brushing teeth.

01:15:44.932 --> 01:15:48.096
- Fuck...
- Trying to tie your tie. Fuck...

01:15:48.170 --> 01:15:49.364
Trying to button down a shirt.

01:15:49.438 --> 01:15:51.769
And fuck that meditation shit.

01:15:53.608 --> 01:15:58.068
And who knew God wanted us
to be so good

01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:00.410
at giving hand jobs?

01:16:03.452 --> 01:16:06.785
My husband is always smiling.

01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:19.291
Parkinson's has made me

01:16:20.702 --> 01:16:22.534
more sensitive and more compassionate.

01:16:22.805 --> 01:16:27.538
Hopefully, got a long way to go in all this.
I feel good, and...

01:16:27.710 --> 01:16:31.578
So, it's a constant battle of
trying to maintain some dignity

01:16:31.648 --> 01:16:32.978
and grace in society.

01:16:33.216 --> 01:16:36.379
And to overcome that,
you just live with what you have.

01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:50.492
Offering to hold the kid for just a minute,
and he ends up in that tree over there.

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:55.394
One of my girlfriends asked me once
if she could get me anything.

01:16:55.671 --> 01:16:59.335
I said, "How about a new brain?
Nothing fancy. "

01:16:59.576 --> 01:17:01.669
She said, "My husband's not using his. "

01:17:03.514 --> 01:17:05.004
Wait. Wait.

01:17:06.016 --> 01:17:10.510
Never mind. Sorry.
I thought I heard a cure coming.

01:17:14.758 --> 01:17:16.750
But there are good things.

01:17:17.028 --> 01:17:21.692
You have to understand
that you're still yourself.

01:17:22.033 --> 01:17:25.695
You're still there. And life goes on.

01:17:26.371 --> 01:17:29.363
And life is beautiful. Thank you.

01:17:37.382 --> 01:17:39.043
Parkinson's, right?

01:17:39.884 --> 01:17:41.045
Oh, no. No.

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:42.451
No, your wife.

01:17:42.887 --> 01:17:44.718
Girlfriend.

01:17:46.725 --> 01:17:47.885
Stage One.

01:17:48.127 --> 01:17:49.889
Good days and bad days, huh?

01:17:50.395 --> 01:17:51.886
Mostly good days.

01:17:52.798 --> 01:17:53.787
You?

01:17:53.966 --> 01:17:55.796
Wife. Since '73.

01:17:56.569 --> 01:17:57.900
Stage Four.

01:17:58.637 --> 01:18:00.229
You got any advice?

01:18:00.472 --> 01:18:03.066
- You don't need my advice.
- Come on. I'm very trainable.

01:18:05.578 --> 01:18:08.775
My advice is to go upstairs,
pack your bags, and leave a nice note.

01:18:08.847 --> 01:18:10.576
Find yourself a healthy woman.

01:18:12.918 --> 01:18:17.083
I love my wife. I do.
But I wouldn't do it over again.

01:18:19.091 --> 01:18:20.923
The thing nobody tells you,

01:18:20.994 --> 01:18:24.020
this disease will steal
everything you love in her.

01:18:24.097 --> 01:18:25.655
Her body, her smile, her mind.

01:18:27.267 --> 01:18:29.599
Sooner or later, she'll lose motor control.

01:18:30.604 --> 01:18:33.437
Eventually, she won't even
be able to dress herself.

01:18:33.506 --> 01:18:36.839
Then, the fun really begins.
Cleaning up her shit.

01:18:37.277 --> 01:18:39.609
Frozen face. Dementia.

01:18:41.616 --> 01:18:43.515
It's not a disease, it's a Russian novel.

01:18:47.521 --> 01:18:50.011
Look, I'm sorry. I'm out of line.

01:18:51.459 --> 01:18:52.790
Hang in there.

01:18:56.731 --> 01:18:59.722
Did you realize there are
other people with Parkinson's?

01:19:00.066 --> 01:19:01.898
How remarkable!

01:19:02.236 --> 01:19:04.898
Amazing people. People doing things.

01:19:05.139 --> 01:19:09.337
Like this one woman runs marathons,
and another one scuba dives.

01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:12.243
And they're pissed off
and they're tired of being marginalized.

01:19:12.313 --> 01:19:13.974
Oh, my God, they are so cool!

01:19:15.149 --> 01:19:17.447
I feel good. I feel really good.

01:19:17.518 --> 01:19:18.883
I feel better than I
have felt in a long time,

01:19:18.884 --> 01:19:20.249
and you brought me here.

01:19:20.322 --> 01:19:23.654
I mean, okay, whatever,
it was the wrong convention, sure, but...

01:19:24.592 --> 01:19:26.925
Jamie, I... Jamie.

01:19:30.031 --> 01:19:32.193
- I have been such a bitch to you.
- Oh, no.

01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:35.327
And you didn't even run away.
How is that possible?

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:37.595
It's like, this is...

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.341
Like, the first time in my life that I've

01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:45.009
ever not felt alone.

01:19:45.348 --> 01:19:48.942
That someone is there for me.
Do you know what that means?

01:19:49.284 --> 01:19:51.116
Oh, my God.

01:19:55.024 --> 01:19:56.218
I love you.

01:19:58.361 --> 01:19:59.349
I do.

01:20:01.297 --> 01:20:04.289
I love you. I love you, I love you.

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:06.465
I really love you.

01:20:35.966 --> 01:20:37.331
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:20:37.401 --> 01:20:39.062
What are you doing?

01:20:40.003 --> 01:20:41.163
Nothing.

01:20:41.672 --> 01:20:43.162
I fell asleep.

01:20:48.879 --> 01:20:50.643
A cure for Parkinson's?

01:20:51.249 --> 01:20:52.510
That's what I'm asking.

01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:53.842
Pfizer, I'm a GP.

01:20:54.084 --> 01:20:58.020
Twenty universities, 15 teaching hospitals,
every major drug company,

01:20:58.088 --> 01:20:59.920
and the goddamn NIH
are all working on this.

01:21:00.191 --> 01:21:01.886
And I'm sure the second they find it,

01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:03.688
you're gonna be
the first in line to sell it to me.

01:21:04.094 --> 01:21:06.256
Well, in the meantime, she gets worse.

01:21:06.531 --> 01:21:09.796
What is this, General Hospital?
What do you want me to do?

01:21:09.868 --> 01:21:11.267
I want you to feel bad about it, Stan.

01:21:11.536 --> 01:21:13.970
If I felt bad about every patient
that I couldn't help,

01:21:14.038 --> 01:21:15.199
then I don't make it through the day.

01:21:15.274 --> 01:21:16.934
What are the cutting edge treatments?

01:21:17.208 --> 01:21:19.404
I don't know.
You want me to get you a list?

01:21:19.478 --> 01:21:20.877
Great. Tomorrow.

01:21:23.882 --> 01:21:25.714
Pfizer, you're a nice kid.

01:21:25.885 --> 01:21:29.218
You're starting to do well.
You sure you want to do this?

01:21:29.388 --> 01:21:31.913
And a list of doctors,
and someone who I can contact at NIH.

01:21:32.057 --> 01:21:33.045
Thank you, Stan.

01:21:34.894 --> 01:21:36.054
Sure.

01:21:58.584 --> 01:21:59.813
See this green area here?

01:22:02.088 --> 01:22:03.418
I'm sorry.

01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:08.960
Tell me, anybody

01:22:10.263 --> 01:22:11.594
You okay?

01:22:16.670 --> 01:22:18.798
Take the Z-Pak. Okay?

01:22:18.873 --> 01:22:19.862
Jesus!

01:22:21.141 --> 01:22:24.270
Do you really give a damn for me?

01:22:28.850 --> 01:22:31.114
I'm sorry, Mr. Randall.
That credit card is declined.

01:22:31.953 --> 01:22:34.285
About a thing that's bothering me

01:22:34.355 --> 01:22:37.188
The benefits of chelation,
every toxic metal is removed.

01:22:37.258 --> 01:22:39.726
I was a rambling pony

01:22:39.794 --> 01:22:41.227
We've achieved complete remission

01:22:41.295 --> 01:22:43.526
in patients with
advanced metastatic cancer,

01:22:44.298 --> 01:22:45.322
MS...

01:22:45.533 --> 01:22:46.522
Fuck!

01:22:46.667 --> 01:22:48.134
...Parkinson's, lupus.

01:22:48.971 --> 01:22:51.495
This therapy changes people's lives.

01:22:51.973 --> 01:22:53.805
He forgot "world peace. "

01:22:55.377 --> 01:22:57.776
Are you saying to me
that we flew 2,000 miles,

01:22:57.845 --> 01:23:00.474
on our own nickel, so you can tell me
that our appointment's been postponed?

01:23:01.549 --> 01:23:02.743
For two weeks?

01:23:03.652 --> 01:23:05.552
I'd like to talk to Dr. Rosenblum, okay?

01:23:06.054 --> 01:23:08.146
Do I look like I care?

01:23:08.490 --> 01:23:11.982
I don't give a shit where he is!
I don't understand...

01:23:13.562 --> 01:23:15.553
Get the head of the hospital on the phone.

01:23:15.831 --> 01:23:17.856
We've arranged our entire schedule
around that,

01:23:17.933 --> 01:23:18.958
and then you come and you tell me...

01:23:19.035 --> 01:23:21.935
No, you don't understand. Okay?
We waited two weeks...

01:23:22.304 --> 01:23:25.398
I would like to talk
to the head of the hospital about it.

01:23:27.442 --> 01:23:28.432
Hey.

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:32.269
Hey.

01:23:32.681 --> 01:23:34.479
- I am so fed up with those people.
- I want to go home.

01:23:34.551 --> 01:23:36.041
Okay, look, we can do the test,
and then go home, okay?

01:23:36.119 --> 01:23:37.176
Randall.

01:23:37.252 --> 01:23:39.778
There's just all this red tape
and all this new protocol...

01:23:39.856 --> 01:23:42.916
Don't try to sell me! Please! Okay?
I'm not going to get better.

01:23:43.192 --> 01:23:46.855
- That's bullshit.
- This is bullshit. I'm tired and I'm bored.

01:23:46.930 --> 01:23:48.523
What are you bored of?

01:23:48.599 --> 01:23:51.032
Parkinson's isn't my life!
I have Parkinson's.

01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:53.797
Why can't I just live my life
instead of becoming this project?

01:23:53.871 --> 01:23:55.861
Do you know that
what's ahead of me is bad enough?

01:23:56.105 --> 01:23:57.595
- Don't you want to get...
- No!

01:23:57.875 --> 01:24:00.537
You want. This has become
way too important to you.

01:24:00.777 --> 01:24:02.404
What are you talking about?
Don't you want to get better?

01:24:02.545 --> 01:24:07.039
Yes! Desperately! It's not going to happen.
All right? News flash, there's no cure.

01:24:08.819 --> 01:24:11.481
Apparently you need to know
that I'll get better in order to love me.

01:24:12.623 --> 01:24:13.885
That's insane.

01:24:23.969 --> 01:24:25.959
You need to get your stuff
out of my apartment.

01:24:26.403 --> 01:24:27.894
What the hell?

01:24:28.573 --> 01:24:32.372
You're on the fast track, Randall.
Chicago, then management.

01:24:32.577 --> 01:24:34.204
Next stop, CEO.

01:24:35.213 --> 01:24:36.907
You can't do that
with a sick person holding you back.

01:24:36.981 --> 01:24:38.142
I can do anything I want.

01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:39.881
I know.

01:24:42.754 --> 01:24:44.415
You're a good man.

01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:47.151
In fact, you're a wonderful man.

01:24:47.225 --> 01:24:49.318
Much better
than you give yourself credit for.

01:24:50.662 --> 01:24:53.325
Nobody wants to be
the one who runs away.

01:24:53.599 --> 01:24:56.089
- I'm not running away.
- It's not your choice.

01:25:01.106 --> 01:25:04.338
Let's just go home.
We can even make love.

01:25:08.014 --> 01:25:09.504
And then you have to leave.

01:25:24.130 --> 01:25:25.461
This is so stupid.

01:25:25.531 --> 01:25:26.623
Stop.

01:25:31.504 --> 01:25:32.836
We don't have to do this.

01:25:33.707 --> 01:25:34.799
Good-bye.

01:27:08.571 --> 01:27:11.131
Hi. You have reached M. Murdock.

01:27:11.207 --> 01:27:14.973
If I'm not picking up, it's probably
because I don't want to talk to you.

01:27:18.748 --> 01:27:21.081
This is actually sad.

01:27:22.152 --> 01:27:24.313
Are you trying to get it
in the actual garbage,

01:27:24.387 --> 01:27:25.946
or just around it, to piss it off?

01:27:33.163 --> 01:27:34.824
Stan! What's up?

01:27:35.098 --> 01:27:38.591
What's fucking up is your friend,
Lisa-Cassie, whatever her name is,

01:27:38.669 --> 01:27:41.661
is having a pajama party
at some rich guy's house this evening.

01:27:41.939 --> 01:27:43.031
Pajama party?

01:27:43.107 --> 01:27:44.096
What's a pajama party?

01:27:44.508 --> 01:27:46.703
Is that, like, girls wearing pajamas?
Getting naked?

01:27:46.777 --> 01:27:51.771
I thought maybe you might bring by
a little vitamin V, some little men in blue.

01:27:52.049 --> 01:27:55.280
Stan, I'd love to. I don't think I can.
I'm feeling a little...

01:27:55.352 --> 01:27:56.342
What are you doing?

01:27:56.421 --> 01:27:57.785
Yes, Stan, it's me, Jamie.

01:27:57.855 --> 01:28:00.255
I'll totally be there. See you later. Bye.

01:28:00.524 --> 01:28:02.493
Hey, you and I are going to a pajama party.

01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:05.120
So, you should get ready,
'cause I'm in pajamas.

01:28:05.997 --> 01:28:07.089
I'm having second thoughts, Jamie.

01:28:07.165 --> 01:28:08.927
I haven't been to a pajama party
since 4th grade.

01:28:08.999 --> 01:28:10.466
What if people start
taking their clothes off?

01:28:10.535 --> 01:28:13.060
Oh, my God! I didn't want
to come here in the first place.

01:28:13.138 --> 01:28:14.230
You're the one who wanted to come.

01:28:14.306 --> 01:28:15.500
Will people have to see me naked?

01:28:15.574 --> 01:28:16.973
I can't even pee in front of other people.

01:28:17.042 --> 01:28:18.031
You have a beautiful body.

01:28:18.109 --> 01:28:20.634
I don't know how many times I have
to tell you, you have a beautiful body.

01:28:20.712 --> 01:28:22.509
It's actually very upsetting
when you say that.

01:28:25.317 --> 01:28:27.308
Well, look who's here!

01:28:27.652 --> 01:28:30.645
How working class. Love it.

01:28:31.557 --> 01:28:32.648
Come in.

01:28:49.342 --> 01:28:54.336
How the fuck am I supposed to do
good medicine on 50 patients a day?

01:28:55.014 --> 01:28:56.345
Plus rounds.

01:28:56.682 --> 01:29:00.346
And phone calls every day with family...
Fucking idiots,

01:29:00.587 --> 01:29:04.352
telling you, "No, you're wrong,"
because they looked it up on the Internet.

01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:10.353
I fight over billing,
I fight over prescription coverage.

01:29:11.698 --> 01:29:15.794
The insurance companies
are dedicated to not paying you.

01:29:17.371 --> 01:29:20.363
And the big law firms, man,
they're just waiting.

01:29:20.707 --> 01:29:25.701
They're just betting you're going to
make that one big mistake.

01:29:27.714 --> 01:29:31.377
This profession for me,
it was a higher calling.

01:29:31.718 --> 01:29:33.777
You know? Make people's lives better.

01:29:39.293 --> 01:29:41.125
And look at me.

01:29:44.231 --> 01:29:45.722
Here they are, for Christ's sake.

01:29:45.967 --> 01:29:48.901
Randall, get up from the floor!
Come with me.

01:29:49.202 --> 01:29:51.694
Come with me. Come on! Come on!

01:29:51.906 --> 01:29:53.066
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Are you all right?

01:29:53.308 --> 01:29:56.334
Go forth, my son. Be fruitful and multiply.

01:29:58.246 --> 01:30:02.580
The thing about the software business
is it's very, very volatile.

01:30:02.917 --> 01:30:06.478
You never know where
the financial model's going to go.

01:30:06.754 --> 01:30:08.881
It changes every six months.

01:30:08.957 --> 01:30:11.358
And you never know
what these hospitals are gonna want.

01:30:11.427 --> 01:30:14.487
One day
it's peer-to-peer connectivity,

01:30:14.563 --> 01:30:18.896
then next it's top-down integration
with their preexisting infrastructure.

01:30:21.770 --> 01:30:23.032
You can touch them, if you want.

01:30:23.372 --> 01:30:25.033
Oh! Oh.

01:30:26.275 --> 01:30:27.606
Thank you.

01:30:29.779 --> 01:30:31.177
- This way. You'll see.
- No, no, no.

01:30:31.246 --> 01:30:33.111
- I don't think we should do this.
- I have a surprise for you.

01:30:33.182 --> 01:30:35.515
No, no, no. Turn around.
I've got a surprise.

01:30:36.118 --> 01:30:38.348
This is my homegirl, Khae.

01:30:39.522 --> 01:30:40.511
Whoa!

01:30:41.458 --> 01:30:43.118
She's Thai.

01:30:43.625 --> 01:30:44.957
And I'm Thai-curious.

01:30:45.729 --> 01:30:47.663
Engine turning over won't you start?

01:30:49.632 --> 01:30:52.863
This one's come to tear me all apart

01:30:53.636 --> 01:30:55.797
She's Jamie-curious.

01:30:58.174 --> 01:31:01.234
Be still my heart

01:31:01.311 --> 01:31:03.404
- So am I.
- No, no, wait. I don't...

01:31:03.747 --> 01:31:06.511
Engine turning over won't you start?

01:31:07.217 --> 01:31:10.244
This one's come to tear me all apart

01:31:10.321 --> 01:31:12.413
Be still my heart

01:31:12.489 --> 01:31:14.981
Did I mention that
I just took my company public?

01:31:15.326 --> 01:31:16.520
It's a pretty exciting thing

01:31:16.594 --> 01:31:18.754
because you work
on something for so long,

01:31:18.828 --> 01:31:21.525
and then
when it comes, it's...

01:31:22.533 --> 01:31:24.763
You know, you see the fruits bear...

01:31:24.835 --> 01:31:29.499
Okay! So, I really have
mixed feelings about this.

01:31:33.511 --> 01:31:36.002
We like Jamie.

01:31:36.313 --> 01:31:39.977
We like Jamie very much.

01:31:40.452 --> 01:31:43.079
Oh. Oh.

01:31:43.655 --> 01:31:44.815
What's wrong?

01:32:04.210 --> 01:32:06.200
Sorry! I'm sorry!

01:32:06.545 --> 01:32:08.206
- Josh!
Be careful.

01:32:08.815 --> 01:32:11.476
- I'm sorry. Stan.
Hey, Pfizie.

01:32:11.550 --> 01:32:13.017
Josh! Ow!

01:32:15.388 --> 01:32:16.376
Josh! Oh!

01:32:16.555 --> 01:32:18.547
Wait! We were just talking!

01:32:18.958 --> 01:32:21.051
- Hi.
- Hi. We got to go.

01:32:21.127 --> 01:32:22.116
Now?
- Josh!

01:32:22.394 --> 01:32:24.488
- It was a pleasure to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you.

01:32:24.564 --> 01:32:25.588
We'll keep in touch.

01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:29.500
It feels like a frozen Popsicle.

01:32:29.936 --> 01:32:32.268
Shit. I didn't know that could even happen.

01:32:32.338 --> 01:32:35.205
It's very rare, but it happens.

01:32:35.274 --> 01:32:37.902
- Do you think they'll have to amputate?
- Shut the fuck up, Josh, and drive!

01:32:37.977 --> 01:32:38.967
Bad joke.

01:32:40.179 --> 01:32:43.115
Fuck! Sorry. I was looking for the shift!

01:32:43.684 --> 01:32:45.242
- So fucking...
- Sorry.

01:32:45.619 --> 01:32:46.915
You know, for whatever it's worth,

01:32:46.986 --> 01:32:49.615
this has truly been
the best night of my life.

01:32:49.690 --> 01:32:50.714
That's wonderful.

01:32:50.791 --> 01:32:52.451
No, seriously. I'm not even kidding.

01:32:52.692 --> 01:32:53.990
And I have you to thank for it.

01:32:54.061 --> 01:32:57.087
I mean, I never thought I would have
an experience like this ever in my life.

01:32:57.331 --> 01:33:01.631
And this is the incredible thing.
This is why I'm so happy right now.

01:33:01.869 --> 01:33:06.897
Because I fucked that girl.
Oh, my shit, I fucked that girl!

01:33:06.974 --> 01:33:07.964
And I'm thinking to myself,

01:33:08.042 --> 01:33:11.704
"Oh, my God, this is empty!
I feel absolutely nothing at all! "

01:33:12.212 --> 01:33:13.680
- That's great, Josh.
- Yeah.

01:33:13.748 --> 01:33:16.511
All those years I was so jealous of you
for having empty sex,

01:33:16.583 --> 01:33:18.449
and now I was the one
having the empty sex,

01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:21.454
and I realized in that moment
that if I hadn't experienced it,

01:33:21.788 --> 01:33:26.055
I wouldn't have known
how much I didn't want it. You know?

01:33:26.127 --> 01:33:30.928
And now I can go back home to Farrah
and feel really good about myself

01:33:30.999 --> 01:33:35.231
for the first time in my entire life.

01:33:35.436 --> 01:33:36.835
And it's all because of you, Jamie.

01:33:37.071 --> 01:33:38.936
It's all because of my big brother Jamie,

01:33:39.007 --> 01:33:41.373
with the enormous cock
that won't go down!

01:33:42.678 --> 01:33:44.077
So thank you, brother!

01:33:44.346 --> 01:33:45.573
Sorry! My bad!

01:33:49.351 --> 01:33:52.183
Plus, my Pfizer stock's up 40%.

01:33:58.928 --> 01:33:59.952
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:34:00.029 --> 01:34:02.691
- Can I help you?
- I'm having a drug reaction.

01:34:02.932 --> 01:34:04.229
What kind of drug reaction?

01:34:07.504 --> 01:34:08.970
Oh. Oh.

01:34:10.973 --> 01:34:12.965
Just take a seat
and we'll be right with you.

01:34:22.552 --> 01:34:23.712
What?

01:34:27.056 --> 01:34:28.388
Chicago.

01:34:29.626 --> 01:34:30.820
I got it.

01:34:30.927 --> 01:34:35.955
Dude. Congratulations!
That is unbelievable.

01:34:36.566 --> 01:34:40.730
Jamie, that's everything that
you've wanted. That's incredible, man.

01:34:40.971 --> 01:34:44.805
I'm very proud of you. I'm not surprised,
but I am very proud of you.

01:34:45.075 --> 01:34:46.736
You know who's going to be thrilled,
is Mom and Dad.

01:34:46.977 --> 01:34:50.378
Jamie Randall makes good.
That's incredible, man.

01:34:50.447 --> 01:34:52.416
You should be very, very proud of yourself.

01:34:52.483 --> 01:34:53.472
Mmm.

01:34:59.824 --> 01:35:02.122
If you're going to serve beef bourguignon,

01:35:02.193 --> 01:35:04.161
you should at least offer
a proper Burgundy.

01:35:04.495 --> 01:35:06.827
Or a Pinot, for Christ's sake.

01:35:13.005 --> 01:35:14.062
Randall.

01:35:15.339 --> 01:35:16.328
Maggie.

01:35:19.644 --> 01:35:21.635
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Jeremy.

01:35:22.114 --> 01:35:23.775
- Justin.
- Justin! Justin.

01:35:26.183 --> 01:35:27.515
I'll go get the car.

01:35:27.853 --> 01:35:30.014
That would be great, Justin.

01:35:42.268 --> 01:35:43.928
I... I was...

01:35:50.876 --> 01:35:52.276
I tried to call you...

01:35:52.545 --> 01:35:54.103
I'm with someone.

01:35:54.180 --> 01:35:55.942
Yeah, I can see that.

01:36:00.552 --> 01:36:01.713
So...

01:36:04.123 --> 01:36:05.317
How are you?

01:36:07.126 --> 01:36:08.115
I'm good.

01:36:09.395 --> 01:36:10.384
Good.

01:36:12.432 --> 01:36:13.626
Come on.

01:36:14.567 --> 01:36:16.125
I gotta go.

01:36:16.603 --> 01:36:17.797
Maggie?

01:36:24.243 --> 01:36:25.403
It

01:36:27.915 --> 01:36:29.246
was nice to see you.

01:36:34.755 --> 01:36:36.484
You're killing me, Randall.

01:36:37.591 --> 01:36:41.323
- Hey. There he is! You ready to celebrate?
- Hey.

01:36:41.995 --> 01:36:42.984
Maggie!

01:36:44.498 --> 01:36:46.524
- Hi, Bruce.
- How are you?

01:36:48.268 --> 01:36:49.496
What are you celebrating?

01:36:49.770 --> 01:36:52.672
This young rock star is about to
take Chicago by storm.

01:36:57.178 --> 01:36:58.304
You got Chicago?

01:37:02.450 --> 01:37:05.385
Congratulations. It was good
to see you, Bruce. I should go.

01:37:05.452 --> 01:37:06.442
Nice to see you, Maggie.

01:37:07.689 --> 01:37:08.781
Peace.

01:37:09.224 --> 01:37:10.316
Uh...

01:37:15.630 --> 01:37:18.565
So, I called it, didn't I call it?
What'd I tell you? Say, "I called it. "

01:37:18.633 --> 01:37:20.100
- You should've put money on it.
- I called it.

01:37:20.168 --> 01:37:21.397
Where you gonna live?

01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:24.233
Downtown, maybe.
Somewhere far away from my family.

01:37:24.305 --> 01:37:25.567
Downtown?

01:37:25.808 --> 01:37:29.072
You? You want Near North, man.
Pussy!

01:37:29.811 --> 01:37:32.474
And bistros, bars,
pussy, pussy, pussy.

01:37:34.983 --> 01:37:37.145
Why don't I move out near you?
The 'burbs.

01:37:37.253 --> 01:37:38.743
We'll go get a beer every once in a while.

01:37:38.821 --> 01:37:41.483
Nah. You don't want to do that. No.

01:37:41.824 --> 01:37:42.984
Why not?

01:37:51.234 --> 01:37:54.293
I got a big raise, buddy. Big raise.

01:37:54.837 --> 01:37:56.169
- You're kidding me.
- Thanks to you!

01:37:56.973 --> 01:37:58.031
Those bastards.

01:37:58.574 --> 01:38:01.908
Buddy, I was never going to get Chicago.
I'm too valuable to them in the field.

01:38:02.012 --> 01:38:03.001
I can't believe this.

01:38:03.079 --> 01:38:06.014
Give me some credit!
It takes a sophisticated eye

01:38:06.116 --> 01:38:08.880
to spot talent in colossal fuck-ups
such as yourself.

01:38:09.786 --> 01:38:12.016
- I don't understand.
- Don't be so naive.

01:38:12.088 --> 01:38:13.350
I didn't actually want to go to Chicago.

01:38:13.423 --> 01:38:14.913
I wanted you to think
I wanted to go to Chicago,

01:38:14.991 --> 01:38:16.356
so you'd want to go to Chicago.

01:38:16.426 --> 01:38:17.984
So you'd work your ass off to get there.

01:38:18.061 --> 01:38:19.426
- Oh, Bruce, this is unbelievable.
- Me,

01:38:19.629 --> 01:38:22.098
I love the road! I love a stinky motel!

01:38:22.466 --> 01:38:25.402
I love the barren back roads
and strip malls of the heartland!

01:38:25.636 --> 01:38:26.660
That's what I love.

01:38:26.737 --> 01:38:28.068
Why would I want to live
in my own house?

01:38:28.138 --> 01:38:29.162
That I pay for?

01:38:29.239 --> 01:38:30.707
Why would I want to
watch my kids play Little League?

01:38:31.209 --> 01:38:33.700
Why the fuck would I want to
sleep in the same bed as my wife?

01:38:33.778 --> 01:38:35.712
Why the fuck would I wanna do that?

01:39:06.712 --> 01:39:07.804
Okay, so...
Okay, so...

01:39:10.415 --> 01:39:12.883
- What's...
- Talk?

01:39:12.951 --> 01:39:14.145
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:39:14.921 --> 01:39:17.445
- Hi, there. Hi. I'm Maggie Murdock.
- Hello!

01:39:18.957 --> 01:39:22.415
I'm about to have
delicious reprobate sex with...

01:39:23.962 --> 01:39:24.952
What's your name?

01:39:25.031 --> 01:39:26.259
Oh, come on.

01:39:26.332 --> 01:39:29.323
Oh, right, right. Jamie something.

01:39:29.401 --> 01:39:34.304
And we're taping it so that he can
always remember how totally hot I am.

01:39:34.541 --> 01:39:35.735
Was.

01:39:35.808 --> 01:39:38.106
Kids, if you're watching this,

01:39:38.177 --> 01:39:40.543
you put it back in Mommy's
secret hiding spot right now

01:39:40.613 --> 01:39:43.480
or you will be sorry.
There will be consequences!

01:39:45.385 --> 01:39:46.716
What else?

01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:48.646
Um...

01:39:51.991 --> 01:39:53.982
Just how happy I am,

01:39:55.162 --> 01:39:57.186
in this moment, right now.

01:39:59.667 --> 01:40:02.135
The way the light's
hitting that face of yours.

01:40:03.937 --> 01:40:07.032
There's this little breeze
coming in through the window.

01:40:08.675 --> 01:40:13.340
It doesn't matter if I have 10,000
more moments like this, or

01:40:15.282 --> 01:40:17.409
just this one, because

01:40:20.521 --> 01:40:22.011
it's all the same.

01:40:24.559 --> 01:40:26.753
Yeah. Just that.

01:40:28.896 --> 01:40:30.956
Right now, this moment.

01:40:35.971 --> 01:40:37.632
I have this.

01:40:51.319 --> 01:40:52.445
No. Damn it!

01:40:53.221 --> 01:40:54.849
Richard! Richard!

01:40:55.191 --> 01:40:56.714
Where is she?

01:41:14.844 --> 01:41:21.807
I been drifting along
in the same stale shoes

01:41:23.553 --> 01:41:29.150
Loose ends tying the noose
in the back of my mind

01:41:29.226 --> 01:41:30.784
Come on! Come on.

01:41:32.795 --> 01:41:33.820
Hey!

01:41:34.197 --> 01:41:35.323
Hey!

01:41:37.099 --> 01:41:40.297
To where the puzzles and pagans lay

01:41:41.672 --> 01:41:43.036
Maggie!

01:41:44.307 --> 01:41:46.741
Hey! Mag!

01:41:50.814 --> 01:41:51.803
Jamie?

01:41:52.215 --> 01:41:53.204
Pull over.

01:41:53.451 --> 01:41:55.281
No, I can't "pull over"!

01:41:55.619 --> 01:41:57.280
Just for a second! Pull over!

01:42:00.491 --> 01:42:03.927
I need to talk

01:42:04.228 --> 01:42:05.252
to you.

01:42:06.130 --> 01:42:09.327
I don't want to talk to you.

01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:15.862
When I wake up
someone will sweep up my lazy bones

01:42:17.375 --> 01:42:23.872
And we will rise in the cool of the evening

01:42:25.717 --> 01:42:27.480
Wait, wait. Okay.

01:42:28.821 --> 01:42:31.084
Open the door. Okay.

01:42:38.263 --> 01:42:39.423
Sorry.

01:42:42.333 --> 01:42:44.029
- I need you.
- Please go away.

01:42:44.403 --> 01:42:46.394
I drove a really long way to say that.

01:42:46.472 --> 01:42:47.632
What? Am I supposed to be impressed?

01:42:48.273 --> 01:42:49.297
I don't know. Yes.

01:42:51.343 --> 01:42:54.312
Look, can you just get off the bus
so we can talk for a second?

01:42:54.546 --> 01:42:57.242
- Just for a second.
- We're on a schedule.

01:42:57.884 --> 01:42:59.544
Five minutes. Please.

01:43:00.686 --> 01:43:03.178
You guys don't mind
if we take five minutes, do you?

01:43:03.256 --> 01:43:04.780
He's handsome.

01:43:05.858 --> 01:43:07.189
- Five minutes.
- He is.

01:43:07.761 --> 01:43:08.921
Five minutes, then I'll let you go.

01:43:19.305 --> 01:43:21.466
I'm full of shit, okay?

01:43:23.710 --> 01:43:27.670
No, I'm knowingly full of shit.

01:43:30.717 --> 01:43:32.048
Because...

01:43:33.220 --> 01:43:34.585
Because...

01:43:37.023 --> 01:43:38.184
I have...

01:43:38.692 --> 01:43:43.527
I have never cared about anybody,
or anything, in my entire life.

01:43:43.998 --> 01:43:46.432
And the thing is,
everybody just kind of accepted that.

01:43:46.500 --> 01:43:48.525
Like, "That's just Jamie! "

01:43:51.906 --> 01:43:53.396
And then you...

01:43:56.644 --> 01:43:57.976
Jesus.

01:43:58.679 --> 01:43:59.839
You.

01:44:05.686 --> 01:44:06.846
You.

01:44:11.525 --> 01:44:12.788
You didn't see me that way.

01:44:16.297 --> 01:44:18.425
I have never known anyone

01:44:20.101 --> 01:44:24.094
who actually believed that I was enough.

01:44:26.608 --> 01:44:27.906
Until I met you.

01:44:35.951 --> 01:44:38.318
And then you made me believe it, too.

01:44:41.289 --> 01:44:44.259
So, unfortunately,

01:44:46.127 --> 01:44:47.618
I need you.

01:44:48.464 --> 01:44:50.125
And you need me.

01:44:52.068 --> 01:44:53.228
No, I don't.

01:44:54.136 --> 01:44:55.660
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

01:44:55.738 --> 01:44:56.763
Yes, you do.

01:44:57.140 --> 01:44:58.333
Stop it. Stop saying that.

01:44:59.175 --> 01:45:01.166
- You need someone to take care of you.
- No, I don't.

01:45:01.444 --> 01:45:03.037
Everybody does.

01:45:11.287 --> 01:45:13.347
I'm going to need you
more than you need me.

01:45:15.725 --> 01:45:17.990
- That's okay.
- No, it's not!

01:45:18.996 --> 01:45:20.623
It isn't fair.

01:45:23.166 --> 01:45:24.963
I have places to go.

01:45:26.203 --> 01:45:27.192
You'll go there.

01:45:29.172 --> 01:45:30.730
I just may have to carry you.

01:45:37.849 --> 01:45:40.715
I can't ask you to do that.

01:45:42.687 --> 01:45:43.847
You didn't.

01:45:50.495 --> 01:45:51.587
Hey,

01:45:52.764 --> 01:45:55.426
let's just say in some

01:45:56.468 --> 01:45:59.834
alternate universe,
there's a couple that's just like us, okay?

01:45:59.904 --> 01:46:03.305
Only she's healthy and he's perfect.

01:46:04.042 --> 01:46:08.036
And their world is about how much money
that they're gonna spend on vacation,

01:46:08.113 --> 01:46:10.376
or who's in a bad mood that day,

01:46:10.448 --> 01:46:13.077
or whether they feel guilty
about having a cleaning lady.

01:46:16.555 --> 01:46:17.715
I don't want to be those people.

01:46:19.358 --> 01:46:20.847
I want us.

01:46:23.896 --> 01:46:25.056
You.

01:46:27.299 --> 01:46:28.459
This.

01:46:45.250 --> 01:46:47.981
I used to worry a lot about
who I'd be when I grew up.

01:46:50.589 --> 01:46:53.582
You know,
like how much money I'd make or...

01:46:54.728 --> 01:46:56.662
Someday I'd become some big deal.

01:46:59.666 --> 01:47:02.533
Sometimes the thing you most want
doesn't happen.

01:47:03.837 --> 01:47:08.501
And sometimes the thing
you never expect to happen, does.

01:47:09.743 --> 01:47:13.577
Like giving up my job in Chicago
and everything,

01:47:14.581 --> 01:47:18.109
and deciding to stay
and apply to med school.

01:47:19.619 --> 01:47:21.110
I don't know.

01:47:21.522 --> 01:47:23.683
You meet thousands of people,

01:47:24.692 --> 01:47:27.024
and none of them really touch you.

01:47:29.296 --> 01:47:31.787
And then you meet one person,

01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:36.464
and your life is changed forever.

01:47:39.774 --> 01:47:43.301
Suppose I never ever saw you

01:47:45.213 --> 01:47:47.977
Suppose we never ever called

01:47:50.117 --> 01:47:53.884
Suppose I kept on singing love songs

01:47:53.955 --> 01:47:58.551
Just to break my own fall

01:47:58.627 --> 01:48:02.893
Just to break my fall

01:48:03.865 --> 01:48:08.700
Just to break my fall

01:48:09.071 --> 01:48:13.633
Just to break my fall

01:48:14.543 --> 01:48:19.037
Break my fall
Break my fall

01:48:20.416 --> 01:48:24.249
All my friends say
that of course it's gonna get better

01:48:24.319 --> 01:48:25.480
Gonna get better

01:48:25.555 --> 01:48:32.051
Better, better, better, better
Better, better, better!

01:48:32.128 --> 01:48:35.428
I never love nobody fully

01:48:37.867 --> 01:48:40.837
Always one foot on the ground

01:48:42.972 --> 01:48:46.966
And by protecting my heart truly

01:48:47.044 --> 01:48:51.640
I got lost in the sounds

01:48:51.715 --> 01:48:56.880
I hear in my mind all of these voices

01:48:56.954 --> 01:49:02.085
I hear in my mind all of these words

01:49:02.159 --> 01:49:07.256
I hear in my mind all of this music

01:49:07.331 --> 01:49:12.064
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart

01:49:12.369 --> 01:49:17.272
I hear in my mind all of these voices

01:49:17.341 --> 01:49:22.507
I hear in my mind all of these words

01:49:22.580 --> 01:49:27.950
I hear in my mind all of this music

01:49:28.019 --> 01:49:32.217
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart

01:49:33.024 --> 01:49:37.324
It breaks my heart

01:49:38.196 --> 01:49:42.530
When it breaks my heart

01:49:43.568 --> 01:49:47.629
When it breaks my heart

01:49:48.606 --> 01:49:51.007
When it breaks my heart

01:49:51.076 --> 01:49:53.566
Breaks my heart

01:49:53.645 --> 01:49:55.773
When it breaks my heart

01:49:56.182 --> 01:50:04.048
When it breaks my heart

01:50:05.305 --> 01:50:11.260
