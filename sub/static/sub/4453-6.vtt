00:39.603 --> 00:41.605
No! No!

00:41.730 --> 00:43.524
It ain't worth it.

00:43.649 --> 00:45.234
No.

00:48.779 --> 00:50.072
Mei!

00:52.241 --> 00:53.241
It's okay.

02:23.207 --> 02:24.875
He wanted to go home.

03:15.217 --> 03:16.552
Need to talk to him.

03:20.472 --> 03:22.558
Thirty million dead in south China.

03:23.225 --> 03:24.893
Scores by my own hand.

03:25.602 --> 03:27.563
A dozen or so, maybe, here.

03:28.105 --> 03:30.566
Mr. Bohannon,
I am exhausted by all the killing.

03:31.150 --> 03:34.236
You gonna pay out
that man's wages to his son.

03:35.028 --> 03:36.739
For the duration. This ends now.

03:37.156 --> 03:39.283
I admired Mr. Tao.
He was a brave man.

03:39.408 --> 03:42.327
Give me an affirmative so I can
walk out of here with a clean shirt.

03:47.583 --> 03:48.959
It's the least I can do.

03:52.379 --> 03:53.589
Nobody else dies.

03:59.344 --> 04:01.221
I no take his money.

04:01.805 --> 04:03.557
Pride ain't gonna bring him back.

04:10.397 --> 04:12.733
Won't ease the hurt none, neither...
Nothing does.

04:16.153 --> 04:18.071
I take my father to China.

04:23.076 --> 04:24.453
A translator?

04:24.578 --> 04:27.456
For Christ's sake, have Chang send
for one of the little shits.

04:27.581 --> 04:30.667
He can have 'em here in a day.
Need a translator I can trust.

04:31.794 --> 04:34.797
Fine, all right. Fair enough.

04:34.922 --> 04:38.383
You know, Bohannon,
since you're gonna be up there anyway,

04:38.509 --> 04:40.928
you mind picking up
a bolt of gingham for Hanna

04:41.053 --> 04:42.554
and some rock candy for the boys?

04:42.679 --> 04:45.307
And Janie's canary flew away last night,

04:45.432 --> 04:46.975
got spooked by the fireworks.

04:47.100 --> 04:50.562
So, there's an avian depository there,
just north of Downtown...

04:50.687 --> 04:53.273
Ji... Jim. I'm going to get a translator.

04:53.732 --> 04:55.400
Well, keep it in mind.

04:56.860 --> 04:59.363
Most folks don't get to San Francisco
as often as you.

05:00.364 --> 05:01.448
Get back quick.

05:02.157 --> 05:03.157
Be gone a day.

05:31.353 --> 05:32.688
All aboard!

06:07.180 --> 06:08.390
Step aside!

06:21.653 --> 06:24.072
- Brigham.
- Thomas.

06:24.865 --> 06:26.617
Gentle... Thank you, gentlemen.

06:29.453 --> 06:34.207
Well, what brings the Defender
of the Saints to Laramie?

06:34.583 --> 06:36.793
Without a telegram
or even an invitation.

06:37.461 --> 06:39.671
Not that you're not welcome.

06:43.133 --> 06:46.887
You owe me half a million dollars
for the Mormon graders I sent you, Thomas.

06:47.012 --> 06:48.639
Payment is long overdue.

06:49.056 --> 06:51.350
Sit, please.

07:01.443 --> 07:02.611
My good man,

07:03.195 --> 07:06.114
I would not dream
of withholding payment,

07:07.074 --> 07:10.118
were I not so viciously
cash poor at present.

07:10.243 --> 07:13.080
The government pays out
$16,000 per mile.

07:13.205 --> 07:15.582
You're making five miles per day!

07:15.707 --> 07:18.794
Which requires an enormous
outlay of capital,

07:18.919 --> 07:20.462
as you can imagine.

07:21.046 --> 07:23.882
I'll give you a day on the matter.
I'm at the hotel.

07:24.549 --> 07:27.219
I can't do anything
on such short notice.

07:28.553 --> 07:32.057
Then you'll be without a third
of your workforce come sundown tomorrow.

07:34.267 --> 07:36.770
Every last damn nickel, Thomas!

08:14.933 --> 08:15.976
What's the hold-up?

08:17.602 --> 08:18.645
Repair crew.

08:19.521 --> 08:20.939
Bridge ain't safe.

08:23.900 --> 08:26.236
You can pick up a train
to San Fran from Sacramento.

08:27.154 --> 08:29.531
It's a two-day ride
by the Dutch Toll Road.

08:31.700 --> 08:33.700
How 'bout this nice looking
work road right here?

08:34.202 --> 08:36.288
- She'll shave a day off.
- Obliged.

08:40.542 --> 08:41.876
Sit tight.

08:42.001 --> 08:44.602
They'll have the bridge repaired
in a few days. Three at the most.

08:45.922 --> 08:47.215
No good, bossman.

08:47.340 --> 08:49.885
Too hot. Waiting no good.

08:51.386 --> 08:52.596
Take us.

08:53.847 --> 08:56.224
Please... Take us?

08:59.019 --> 09:00.729
Ain't got the time,
nor the supplies.

09:00.854 --> 09:03.356
Here, give that to the foreman.

09:04.232 --> 09:07.027
Tell him you want a hot meal
and your own tent for the night.

09:41.269 --> 09:42.479
Hell.

10:04.960 --> 10:06.128
Ho.

10:08.588 --> 10:10.924
- Railroad man.
- Stagecoach Mary.

10:11.758 --> 10:13.343
Headed to Sacramento?

10:13.468 --> 10:15.345
- Truckee?
- That's right.

10:15.846 --> 10:18.241
There's bridge repair ahead,
you'll have to go around at the camp.

10:18.265 --> 10:20.642
But then you're straight and smooth
all the way to the barn.

10:20.767 --> 10:22.811
You got an easy ride on
up to the river,

10:22.936 --> 10:24.896
but you wanna take care crossing.

10:25.021 --> 10:26.815
She's running high
and the bed is jagged.

10:26.940 --> 10:28.191
Obliged.

10:29.276 --> 10:31.778
Sacramento's awful far.
You in need?

10:32.112 --> 10:34.197
I can use a side of bacon,
you got any spare?

10:34.322 --> 10:37.450
I got some to sell.
I could let it go for $3.

10:44.124 --> 10:45.292
One dollar.

10:46.710 --> 10:47.836
You see any pigs out here?

10:50.046 --> 10:52.007
Drive to Truckee three day.

10:52.132 --> 10:53.967
Sun hot. Meat spoil.

10:54.467 --> 10:57.929
Bridge crew will be happy to pay
top dollar for some fresh cut bacon.

10:58.054 --> 11:01.099
Fresh yesterday. Yesterday $3.

11:01.224 --> 11:02.809
Tomorrow, one dollar.

11:04.895 --> 11:06.897
Two dollars then... Today.

11:16.907 --> 11:18.783
Pleasure doing business with you, Mary.

11:19.743 --> 11:21.578
Careful on that river, railroad man.

11:24.080 --> 11:25.248
Heh!

11:28.251 --> 11:29.669
Glad we ran into 0l' Mary.

11:32.088 --> 11:33.298
Pay too much.

11:37.594 --> 11:38.762
You are tough, ain't you?

11:44.351 --> 11:45.685
So China?

11:47.103 --> 11:49.648
San Francisco steamer to Hong Kong.

11:50.357 --> 11:52.108
I have gold eagle, right?

11:53.151 --> 11:55.779
No. Railroad'll pay.

11:56.696 --> 11:59.216
Figured there wasn't nothing left for you
back in China, is all.

12:01.493 --> 12:02.702
My father,

12:03.328 --> 12:06.206
he no let rebel leader take me.

12:07.540 --> 12:09.042
He give up everything.

12:11.336 --> 12:12.671
Everything except you.

12:16.466 --> 12:18.551
Now, I bring my father home.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.097
Yeah, I tried that once.

12:23.723 --> 12:25.100
Going back home.

12:27.352 --> 12:30.355
Did it for my grandfather...
and my father.

12:35.068 --> 12:36.569
Hell, I did it for honor.

12:44.577 --> 12:47.038
Sometimes, I still wake up
with ashes in my mouth.

12:52.168 --> 12:54.254
My father say you good man.

12:55.839 --> 12:57.340
Honorable man.

13:05.098 --> 13:06.725
Thank you.

13:14.065 --> 13:15.233
Goodnight.

13:53.521 --> 13:54.898
Let me get this straight.

13:55.023 --> 13:57.233
Brigham Young is here to get paid

13:57.359 --> 13:59.319
for services you contracted?

13:59.861 --> 14:00.904
Yes.

14:01.488 --> 14:02.697
And if he isn't satisfied,

14:02.822 --> 14:05.617
he's going to pull his workers
and send them home?

14:05.742 --> 14:08.453
To the Great Salt Lake.

14:08.578 --> 14:10.205
Poor miserable bastards...

14:10.330 --> 14:12.290
How do you take it?
Light and sweet.

14:14.667 --> 14:16.002
We're flush, New York.

14:16.920 --> 14:19.681
There's better things for you and I to do
with the railroad's money.

14:21.466 --> 14:23.551
You know, in the cattle business,

14:23.676 --> 14:27.931
the only thing more valuable
than beef on the hoof is information.

14:28.932 --> 14:32.102
And what information have you in mind
for Mr. Young?

14:32.560 --> 14:35.355
All kinds of information
can be valuable.

14:35.480 --> 14:38.608
Particularly information
regarding the whereabouts of rustlers.

14:39.734 --> 14:43.363
Now, didn't you mention something to me
about a map from the Central Pacific?

14:47.492 --> 14:48.952
Here's to rustlers.

14:49.953 --> 14:51.162
And schemers.

15:20.275 --> 15:21.943
Do you know who I am, young lady?

15:23.361 --> 15:25.113
My mama taught me to love you.

15:26.114 --> 15:30.452
Same as I loved Jesus and Joseph Smith.

15:31.453 --> 15:32.829
You're a Mormon.

15:32.954 --> 15:34.164
Jack Mormon.

15:34.956 --> 15:37.542
We was on our way to Salt Lake City

15:38.334 --> 15:39.961
when the Yavapai attacked.

15:42.547 --> 15:44.716
You've spent time amongst the Lamanites.

15:44.841 --> 15:45.884
Yeah.

15:46.468 --> 15:51.306
I thought I'd have myself
a nice Mormon husband when I was grown.

15:52.140 --> 15:54.017
A family of sister wives...

15:55.977 --> 15:58.897
I thought I'd spend
every Sunday in the Temple,

15:59.981 --> 16:03.318
listening to the Lion of the Lord
preach the Word.

16:06.237 --> 16:08.072
I thought I'd spend my whole life

16:08.656 --> 16:10.450
spittin' distance from you.

16:11.451 --> 16:14.996
You would have been
very welcome in Zion, child.

16:15.747 --> 16:18.124
Yeah, well, instead I got
this marked up face,

16:19.250 --> 16:20.835
little bit of Indian magic,

16:21.669 --> 16:23.213
and a brothel full of whores.

16:27.842 --> 16:29.344
You're still Mormon.

16:31.638 --> 16:32.764
Jack.

16:45.276 --> 16:47.362
It's never too late...

16:48.696 --> 16:51.366
to return to the fold
and be forgiven, my child.

16:53.117 --> 16:56.704
Heavenly Father's loving embrace
awaits us all.

16:58.665 --> 17:00.124
We have only to accept it.

17:04.587 --> 17:06.089
I will pray for you.

17:32.574 --> 17:34.409
H0! Ho, ha!

17:36.411 --> 17:38.037
Hold this.

17:39.080 --> 17:40.748
Go around, bossman.

17:41.207 --> 17:43.710
No. Dutch Toll's too far.

17:45.128 --> 17:46.796
We got to cross here.

17:47.714 --> 17:49.424
Slow and steady.

17:49.882 --> 17:51.175
You do as I say, all right?

17:54.554 --> 17:55.680
Easy.

17:56.347 --> 17:57.515
Ho! Ho!

17:58.433 --> 17:59.517
Easy, now!

18:00.351 --> 18:01.436
Easy!

18:12.447 --> 18:14.115
Easy.

18:14.240 --> 18:17.785
Damn it. The bottom's too rough,
got to turn these horses. Hup!

19:21.808 --> 19:23.142
Swim for the shore!

19:29.816 --> 19:30.942
Swim for the bank!

20:25.371 --> 20:26.789
Le-tkr/Teengo!

20:26.914 --> 20:29.792
No! Mei! Mei!

20:29.917 --> 20:32.086
Let it go.

20:47.518 --> 20:49.645
You shouldn't be up
after all you've been through.

20:49.771 --> 20:51.647
I heard Brigham Young was outside.

20:51.773 --> 20:54.400
You've got to let the slippery elm
do its work.

20:55.109 --> 20:56.986
I am. I... I Will.

20:57.111 --> 21:00.406
From bed.
In case of infection, you need to rest.

21:01.449 --> 21:04.786
Eva, thank you.

21:04.911 --> 21:07.330
I truly appreciate
everything that you've done,

21:07.455 --> 21:08.956
and I promise you that I will rest.

21:09.081 --> 21:11.751
But I... I need a story, Eva.

21:12.168 --> 21:14.128
I haven't had a decent scoop in months.

21:14.253 --> 21:17.131
Slippery elm don't work
on your schedule, Miss Ellison.

21:17.256 --> 21:20.468
If you don't respect it,
it can turn real bad.

21:21.135 --> 21:22.595
I'm fine.

21:27.266 --> 21:29.685
Now, what is your interest
in the railroad, Mr. Young?

21:30.269 --> 21:33.898
The interest is not mine,
madam, but Heavenly Father's.

21:34.023 --> 21:36.859
I'm His instrument in this,
as in everything.

21:36.984 --> 21:37.984
So...

21:39.070 --> 21:41.572
God wants a railroad?

21:44.242 --> 21:45.409
Just this morning,

21:46.828 --> 21:49.705
I met a young lady
who was attacked by savages

21:49.831 --> 21:51.666
on her family's pilgrimage West.

21:52.083 --> 21:53.334
Let me ask you,

21:54.669 --> 21:56.379
would Heavenly Father,

21:56.504 --> 22:00.299
who sent a million gulls to clear the
locusts for his starving people,

22:00.424 --> 22:02.552
would He want His saints

22:02.677 --> 22:05.596
scalped and defiled
on their way to Zion?

22:06.264 --> 22:08.808
So, you're hoping the
Union Pacific's route

22:08.933 --> 22:13.688
will allow the faithful safe passage
to the Promised Land?

22:14.188 --> 22:16.023
Salt Lake City is to be the terminus.

22:17.024 --> 22:18.609
The terminus?

22:22.363 --> 22:26.242
Forgive me, Mr. Young...

22:26.367 --> 22:27.367
but...

22:28.202 --> 22:30.621
Is that your faith speaking?

22:31.205 --> 22:33.624
I have assurances from both railroads.

22:36.043 --> 22:37.920
Are you ill, Miss Ellison?

22:38.045 --> 22:39.672
Can I offer you a drink of water?

22:39.797 --> 22:42.174
I'm... I'm fine.

22:42.300 --> 22:44.427
Thank you, that... that's all.

22:44.552 --> 22:47.054
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Young.

22:47.471 --> 22:48.681
Thank you.

23:39.523 --> 23:40.816
Please, get on the horse.

23:41.275 --> 23:42.652
No.

23:42.777 --> 23:44.320
The wagon's gone.

23:44.445 --> 23:46.125
We've lost most of our supplies, and it...

23:46.238 --> 23:48.532
This has gone on long enough.
We gotta go back to Truckee.

23:49.116 --> 23:50.618
Go without.

23:51.369 --> 23:52.828
I bury my father.

23:55.623 --> 23:56.874
He's gone.

23:58.918 --> 24:00.211
Mei, it's over.

24:01.921 --> 24:04.006
We both got to live
with things left undone.

24:10.805 --> 24:12.765
Shit.

24:43.796 --> 24:45.006
We'll bury him here.

24:46.632 --> 24:49.927
No. No.

25:36.015 --> 25:37.475
Set that shovel down. Sit.

25:37.600 --> 25:40.311
It's son's duty to bury father.

25:44.398 --> 25:45.983
Just be his daughter, then.

25:47.026 --> 25:48.277
Come on.

25:58.829 --> 26:00.790
You have dug many graves.

26:01.457 --> 26:03.375
Too many to count.

26:06.629 --> 26:08.506
But the worst was the ones I couldn't bury.

26:12.968 --> 26:16.472
When my mother was killed,
we couldn't bury.

26:18.474 --> 26:19.809
No wake.

26:20.392 --> 26:21.727
No funeral.

26:24.063 --> 26:27.483
No grave for ancestor to take care of.

26:30.986 --> 26:32.488
Her ghost wander...

26:35.199 --> 26:38.160
Tired, hungry...

26:43.374 --> 26:44.875
All alone.

26:47.253 --> 26:48.587
Now my father,

26:50.506 --> 26:52.424
his ghost too must wander...

26:53.676 --> 26:56.011
Hungry, lonesome...

26:59.056 --> 27:00.432
Just like my mother.

27:09.608 --> 27:11.193
Maybe they'll find each other.

27:23.622 --> 27:27.710
Collie Huntington
sat at my dinner table

27:27.835 --> 27:30.504
and assured me of his commitment

27:30.629 --> 27:32.756
to a Salt Lake City terminus.

27:32.882 --> 27:35.217
Clearly, he intends to go north,

27:35.342 --> 27:38.137
bypassing Salt Lake altogether.

27:38.262 --> 27:41.023
I fail to see what this has to do
with the money you owe me, Thomas.

27:41.056 --> 27:44.226
We are both victims
of Huntington's treachery.

27:45.060 --> 27:49.356
I have engaged vast resources
toward Salt Lake, as promised.

27:49.857 --> 27:52.568
Including plans to bridge
the Lake itself.

27:52.693 --> 27:53.986
Mrs. Palmer.

27:54.570 --> 27:58.407
As you can see, it is an
expensive bridge, Mr. Young.

28:00.075 --> 28:03.120
Now, you came here for payment,
and payment you will have,

28:03.245 --> 28:06.999
along with the great
Transcontinental Railroad

28:07.124 --> 28:09.793
and all its goods and services,
capital and trade,

28:09.919 --> 28:11.879
flowing through your backyard...

28:13.005 --> 28:14.840
The lifeblood of Zion.

28:14.965 --> 28:17.593
Just as soon as the railroad is complete.

28:18.761 --> 28:21.013
I shall have payment in full

28:21.138 --> 28:23.057
before I leave this room, madam,

28:23.849 --> 28:28.103
or I shall call every sober saint home
to Utah.

28:28.229 --> 28:31.273
You leave here with your workforce

28:31.398 --> 28:34.151
and you will have
no payment whatsoever!

28:34.485 --> 28:36.862
Nor railroad terminus.

28:37.321 --> 28:38.781
You will remain as you are...

28:39.448 --> 28:41.158
An aging charlatan,

28:41.951 --> 28:46.372
the polygamous master
of a doomed and desert-locked sect!

28:48.749 --> 28:51.168
Or... take this map,

28:51.961 --> 28:54.880
proof of the Central Pacific's
dirty dealings,

28:55.005 --> 28:56.340
as down payment.

28:58.175 --> 29:01.345
Brigham, allow me to keep
every available worker

29:01.470 --> 29:04.181
laying track toward Salt Lake.

29:08.143 --> 29:10.354
Our contract stands for now.

29:11.313 --> 29:14.358
Lay one track north of Salt Lake,

29:15.359 --> 29:19.071
and you'll learn why they call me
the Lion of the Lord.

29:19.738 --> 29:21.991
I've defeated the United States Army.

29:22.700 --> 29:24.702
I'd damn sure make short work of you.

29:26.537 --> 29:27.913
I'm going home.

29:28.831 --> 29:32.835
I'm weary of gentile serpents

29:33.711 --> 29:36.046
and their honey-lipped harlots.

29:47.766 --> 29:51.895
Well, I believe that man just called me
a "honey-lipped harlot."

29:53.856 --> 29:56.734
I believe he just called you

29:57.568 --> 30:00.070
my honey-lipped harlot.

30:02.364 --> 30:04.116
Steady on, New York.

30:04.241 --> 30:05.951
We got a land deal to finish.

30:10.539 --> 30:11.790
Shh...

30:12.750 --> 30:14.251
I found you by the hotel.

30:15.127 --> 30:17.004
You have an infection.

30:17.129 --> 30:19.381
We have to keep your fever down
while you fight it.

30:19.757 --> 30:22.134
No, Miss Ellison, stop that.

30:22.259 --> 30:24.720
Please, lay back.
No, you need the bed.

30:25.095 --> 30:26.305
Louise.

30:28.599 --> 30:30.392
My honey-lipped harlot.

30:34.104 --> 30:36.607
Hey, I'm your friend.

30:37.775 --> 30:39.276
Now, lay down.

31:46.218 --> 31:47.886
My mother's things.

32:05.195 --> 32:06.530
Please.

32:07.531 --> 32:08.699
Come.

33:04.004 --> 33:05.214
For my father.

33:05.339 --> 33:08.050
Light will help ghost find his way home.

33:11.011 --> 33:12.429
For your ghosts.

33:13.222 --> 33:16.683
Those you have buried
and those you could not.

33:23.190 --> 33:24.900
When light goes out...

33:27.361 --> 33:28.445
they will be home.

34:48.775 --> 34:50.360
The night is cold.

34:51.862 --> 34:53.905
Too cold to sleep outside.

35:52.255 --> 35:54.132
I lost my wife and boy.

36:00.764 --> 36:02.099
I'm sorry.

36:08.814 --> 36:10.148
Thank you...

36:11.983 --> 36:15.612
for everything, bossman.

36:18.573 --> 36:19.991
Cullen.

36:21.993 --> 36:23.370
It's Cullen.

36:25.831 --> 36:27.040
Cullen.

37:28.018 --> 37:30.187
I ain't slept this late
since before the war.

37:31.021 --> 37:32.773
Long journey today.

37:36.860 --> 37:38.361
Coffee first.

37:40.697 --> 37:42.866
Brother.

37:43.450 --> 37:45.410
My father has declared
a work stoppage.

37:45.952 --> 37:48.246
We're to report home
to Salt Lake immediately.

37:48.371 --> 37:49.915
Are you certain, my son?

37:51.541 --> 37:54.544
Collie Huntington
has deceived him.

37:55.712 --> 37:58.590
This is a great blessing.

37:59.883 --> 38:01.510
Your time is upon us.

38:02.052 --> 38:04.471
Are you prepared
for your ascension?

38:05.514 --> 38:09.309
With your help, and by the grace
of Heavenly Father, I will be.

38:11.228 --> 38:13.188
I'll go order the men to start packing.
Brother.

38:16.691 --> 38:21.988
A band of apostates
lurks in the Utah hinterlands.

38:22.739 --> 38:26.576
If these unholy creatures
unearth themselves,

38:26.701 --> 38:30.247
they will destroy us
with their hideous lies.

38:30.747 --> 38:33.500
They have already tried to destroy me.

38:35.585 --> 38:39.256
Collie Huntington
has deceived him.

38:39.840 --> 38:43.552
Aaron Hatch and his clan.

38:43.677 --> 38:46.263
We must root them out,
Brother Phineas.

38:47.013 --> 38:48.682
I'll speak to my father on it.

38:49.266 --> 38:51.601
Perhaps he knows their whereabouts.

39:07.117 --> 39:08.785
This'll ease the cramps some.

39:13.331 --> 39:15.083
Still gonna hurt a few days, though.

39:35.312 --> 39:36.897
You're an angel.

39:47.407 --> 39:49.326
No one's ever cared for me like you.

39:51.202 --> 39:52.829
Not even my own mother.

40:18.188 --> 40:19.731
<i>"Brigham Young has assurances</i>

40:19.856 --> 40:22.567
<i>"that the terminus of the great
Transcontinental Railroad</i>

40:22.692 --> 40:26.279
<i>"will be Utah's capitol.
But I have it on good authority</i>

40:26.404 --> 40:31.284
<i>"that the Union Pacific's plan
to bridge a large lake is a boondoggle.</i>

40:31.993 --> 40:34.204
<i>"There is no larger lake
than the Great Salt Lake</i>

40:34.329 --> 40:35.997
<i>"for which the city is named.</i>

40:36.498 --> 40:39.209
<i>"Which leads me to wonder, dear reader,"</i>

40:39.334 --> 40:42.921
<i>"is the Union Pacific
deliberately falsifying its plans"</i>

40:43.046 --> 40:45.173
<i>"in order to deceive the Mormon leader?"</i>

40:48.093 --> 40:49.719
<i>"Thomas 'Doc' Durant has promised</i>

40:49.844 --> 40:53.098
<i>"'Christmas in New York,
New Year's in San Francisco.'"</i>

40:53.974 --> 40:56.393
<i>"A romantic notion from a man
who has served time"</i>

40:56.518 --> 40:58.395
<i>"for defrauding
the American treasury."</i>

41:00.021 --> 41:03.858
<i>"But where will the Central Pacific
and Union Pacific meet, if at all?</i>

41:04.567 --> 41:07.696
<i>"Will the American people
ever have the railroad they deserve?"</i>

41:08.238 --> 41:10.073
<i>"Or, like Brigham Young,"</i>

41:10.198 --> 41:13.535
<i>"have we all been hoodwinked
by the notorious railroad baron"</i>

41:13.660 --> 41:16.162
<i>"in the greatest swindle
of our time?"</i>

41:25.088 --> 41:26.256
Been more than a day.

41:26.589 --> 41:28.133
Long story, Jim.

41:28.258 --> 41:30.927
Well, where's the damn translator?

41:31.428 --> 41:32.762
You're looking at him.

41:33.263 --> 41:35.473
I don't suppose you have a canary
in your pocket?

41:35.598 --> 41:37.142
Well, hell, who cares?

41:38.601 --> 41:40.103
We got bigger fish.

41:43.940 --> 41:46.276
- Shit.
- No shit.

41:46.401 --> 41:49.612
President Ulysses S. Grant
has called a meeting in Salt Lake City.

41:49.738 --> 41:53.116
Huntington's already on his way there.
And you, my friend, are late.

41:53.241 --> 41:55.201
Get your ragged-lookin' ass to Utah.

41:55.326 --> 41:57.662
I'll see to it John here
gets to the tunnel.

41:59.581 --> 42:01.499
Fong!
