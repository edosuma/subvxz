WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:03.344
<i>Previously on</i> Justified...

00:04.605 --> 00:05.709
You're hit!

00:06.006 --> 00:07.952
It's not me. It's you.

00:08.108 --> 00:10.520
He lost a lot of blood.
He went out in the ambulance.

00:10.611 --> 00:11.715
Hasn't opened his eyes since.

00:11.812 --> 00:12.984
That's my heroin!
Dewey...

00:13.046 --> 00:14.320
Or you don't think
I'll shoot?

00:14.615 --> 00:17.323
I will shoot.
The way I shot Wade Messer!

00:17.384 --> 00:18.692
We got you on tape, Dewey,

00:18.785 --> 00:20.458
talking heroin, big dreams.

00:20.654 --> 00:22.133
You heard that?
About Messer, too.

00:22.289 --> 00:23.859
You're saying you're
going after Boyd Crowder?

00:24.124 --> 00:25.569
We're going after him
under the RICO Statute.

00:25.692 --> 00:26.693
We're gonna bury him.

00:26.793 --> 00:27.897
And you want me to help?

00:27.995 --> 00:30.032
Before you go? Yeah.

00:30.330 --> 00:32.970
You were lousy at running
heroin, Boyd Crowder.

00:33.133 --> 00:37.240
But from what I'm told, you are
really good at robbing banks.

00:37.337 --> 00:39.749
I came here
to go over the rules.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.218
How you make a call. How
you record a conversation.

00:42.309 --> 00:43.652
How I send
an emergency signal.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.587
What to do if
I'm in danger. Yeah.

00:45.812 --> 00:47.348
And you're clear?
Mmm-hmm.

00:47.548 --> 00:48.549
Then we're good.

00:48.916 --> 00:51.419
<i>Are you serious? This is...
Is really happening?</i>

00:51.518 --> 00:52.588
Papework's been filed.

00:52.686 --> 00:54.188
Just a matter of
routine approvals.

00:54.254 --> 00:56.666
I'll be there, all moved in,
in a few weeks.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.070
Goddamn, she's beautiful.

01:01.194 --> 01:03.174
Oh, little lady, you're
wide awake, aren't you?

01:07.935 --> 01:09.414
Want Mr. Turtle?

01:16.109 --> 01:17.349
I'll tell you a secret.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.854
Your daddy is pretty tough,

01:20.914 --> 01:22.757
but he is no match
for the graveyard shift.

01:28.455 --> 01:30.264
Oh, Raylan,

01:30.357 --> 01:33.201
what in the world is
worth missing this for?

02:05.726 --> 02:06.727
Bourbon.

02:09.162 --> 02:10.232
Tequila.

02:18.405 --> 02:19.679
Hey, Yankee.

02:19.773 --> 02:20.979
If you're looking
for the whorehouse,

02:21.074 --> 02:23.315
it's just around the corner,
just past the Starbucks.

02:25.078 --> 02:27.319
I'm looking for
a Federals named Aguilar.

02:27.414 --> 02:28.916
Don't suppose that's you?

02:30.083 --> 02:32.324
It depends.
On?

02:32.419 --> 02:33.591
What it is you want.

02:35.922 --> 02:38.493
Never really developed
a taste for tequila.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.037
Kind of hard to understand
how you make a drink

02:40.127 --> 02:41.435
out of
something like that...

02:41.495 --> 02:43.441
Sharp, inhospitable.

02:44.698 --> 02:45.870
Same reason
I never understood

02:45.966 --> 02:47.343
the fascination
with the artichoke.

02:48.101 --> 02:49.546
Who are you? DEA?

02:49.636 --> 02:51.513
Now, Bourbon is
easy to understand.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.107
Tastes like
a warm summer day.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.379
Texas Ranger?

02:54.775 --> 02:55.776
U.S. Marshals Service.

02:57.210 --> 02:59.349
Just got a couple questions,
I'll be on my way.

03:00.614 --> 03:01.684
Four weeks ago,

03:01.782 --> 03:04.353
you reported finding an
abandoned truck in the desert

03:04.451 --> 03:07.455
with the bodies of some
drug-running Americans.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.364
You read the report.
I have nothing more to say.

03:09.456 --> 03:11.060
I ain't looking
to jam you up.

03:11.158 --> 03:13.365
Makes no difference to me
if you hijacked the truck

03:13.460 --> 03:14.666
hoping to find some drugs,

03:14.728 --> 03:16.799
instead got a wagonload
of dead gringos.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.706
Don't even care if a little
money was exchanged.

03:18.799 --> 03:21.712
How you boys do things down
here is none of my business.

03:21.802 --> 03:24.681
I just want to know about
the other men in that desert,

03:24.738 --> 03:26.581
the ones
that walked out alive.

03:28.308 --> 03:29.480
You walk through that door,

03:29.543 --> 03:31.318
putting your hat on
like you mean business,

03:31.378 --> 03:33.380
like God gave you
a big set of swinging <i>cojones</i>.

03:34.314 --> 03:36.351
Look around you.
This is Mexico, <i>cabrón</i>.

03:36.983 --> 03:38.894
And that star you wear
don't mean shit.

03:38.985 --> 03:40.555
Now, a Ranger badge...
Ah, a Ranger badge,

03:40.654 --> 03:41.826
that means something.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.892
They bang it out of
a 1948 Mexican silver coin.

03:44.991 --> 03:46.902
And
you don't even have a gun,

03:46.993 --> 03:48.063
which is a good thing,

03:48.161 --> 03:50.266
or else I'd stick your
Yankee ass in a Mexican prison

03:50.363 --> 03:52.400
where you can eat
shit for all I care.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.106
Now take that worthless star
and get out of my city.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.078
Thank you for the drink.

04:04.177 --> 04:05.554
I'll be in touch.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.090
This is Mexico, <i>cabrón!</i>

05:20.020 --> 05:21.590
I told you
I'd be in touch.

05:58.058 --> 06:00.800
Welcome to the United States
of America, chief.

06:00.861 --> 06:04.502
Around these parts,
this star means something.

06:07.467 --> 06:08.571
Feel like talking?

07:27.380 --> 07:29.087
You want to smoke that shit,

07:29.883 --> 07:31.123
do it outside my truck.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.062
And one more.

07:48.735 --> 07:50.271
"I believe
that banking institutions

07:50.337 --> 07:53.011
"are a greater threat to our
liberties than standing armies."

07:54.741 --> 07:56.015
Thomas Jefferson.

07:59.746 --> 08:01.191
Right this way,
Mr. Crowder.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.831
Would you like a private room,
Mr. Crowder?

08:11.925 --> 08:13.370
No, ma'am. I believe
this will be a quick one.

08:24.871 --> 08:27.351
Excuse me!
Can I please get some help?

08:30.610 --> 08:32.783
I'll be fine.
Thank you, Mr. Crowder.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.890
Thank you.
You're welcome.

08:39.986 --> 08:41.465
I appreciate your help.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.243
Boyd!

10:46.846 --> 10:47.847
Where's Hollis?

10:48.748 --> 10:50.750
I let him go.

10:52.585 --> 10:54.496
Yet I hired him
to do the job.

10:55.755 --> 10:58.031
Well, Ava, I figure
what's mine is yours,

10:58.124 --> 10:59.933
what's yours is mine,
so I...

11:00.593 --> 11:02.266
Thought I'd just
do it myself.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.799
Besides, all that's left
is lo paint.

11:04.864 --> 11:06.502
I can get to that tomorrow.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.169
Then what?

11:08.268 --> 11:09.474
You tell me.

11:10.770 --> 11:12.977
I got to wake up.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.851
Do you want
a coke or a coffee?

11:17.343 --> 11:18.515
Well, you got
a cold beer?

11:18.978 --> 11:20.048
I do.

11:20.146 --> 11:21.454
You got two?

11:22.448 --> 11:23.654
I just got out of bed.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.059
I'm just trying
to make you smile.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.163
Look, Ava,

11:30.790 --> 11:32.326
I know what
you're going through.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.003
Being in prison
ain't easy on anybody.

11:36.629 --> 11:38.631
I mean, I have been there...

11:38.698 --> 11:39.733
More than once.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.646
If you want to
talk about it...

11:44.637 --> 11:45.707
I mean, hell, girl,

11:45.805 --> 11:47.307
if you want to talk
about anything, really.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.419
Let me get you that beer.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.397
Mexico went well.

12:35.455 --> 12:36.763
How'd you know?

12:37.190 --> 12:38.931
You seem happy.
You never seem happy.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.698
What are you talking about?
I'm always happy.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.598
You found the Federals?
Found him,

12:43.696 --> 12:45.869
had a very fruitful
conversation,

12:45.932 --> 12:48.640
and in return, I set him up
with some nice accommodations

12:48.735 --> 12:51.716
in the El Paso lockup
so he doesn't disappear.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.273
He gave me a witness
who was with Boyd

12:53.373 --> 12:55.375
when Johnny Crowder
and the rest were killed.

12:55.441 --> 12:58.217
We get his testimony,
Boyd's looking at murder one.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.758
Make that the centerpiece
of your RICO case.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.117
Who's the witness?
Dewey Crowe.

13:05.051 --> 13:07.429
Dewey Crowe?
Dewey Crowe.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.296
Should I tell him,
or you?

13:09.389 --> 13:10.732
Dewey Crowe
is being released.

13:11.157 --> 13:13.103
That's unfortunate.
Charges didn't stick.

13:13.159 --> 13:14.968
His confession
to killing Messer...

13:15.061 --> 13:16.233
He said he was
just joking.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.302
He also says
that he took the heroin

13:18.398 --> 13:20.071
just to keep it
off the streets.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.771
You know,
doing his civic duty.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.814
Call Reardon. Get him
to block the release.

13:23.903 --> 13:25.246
It's not that simple.
Why not?

13:25.305 --> 13:27.012
Because of your history with
Mr. Crowe, Raylan.

13:27.106 --> 13:28.676
I'm sure you remember
the Federal Government

13:28.775 --> 13:30.777
awarding him 300 grand
a couple months back,

13:30.843 --> 13:33.653
tacitly admitting harassment
by the Marshals Service,

13:33.746 --> 13:35.987
in the person
of Raylan Givens.

13:36.082 --> 13:38.358
To which his lawyer
believes his current detention

13:38.451 --> 13:40.158
bears more than
a passing resemblance.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.425
Bottom line is,

13:41.754 --> 13:44.166
Dewey Crowds getting out
in about three hours.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.829
Well, maybe
that's not such a bad thing.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.830
Yeah. Screw it.
Let's not even fight it.

13:50.930 --> 13:51.965
We'll give him some rope.

13:52.031 --> 13:54.477
Dewey's gonna screw up again.
When he does, I'll be there.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.377
Except lawyers being lawyers,

13:56.469 --> 13:58.608
she's petitioned that you stay
1,000 feet away from him.

13:58.671 --> 13:59.877
Now I got to
keep my distance?

13:59.972 --> 14:01.042
Pretty much.

14:01.140 --> 14:02.778
But we get Dewey,
we get Boyd.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.015
That is why I'm here.
Yes.

14:05.111 --> 14:09.685
Officially, my boss is
not gonna let me let you

14:09.782 --> 14:11.693
violate Dewey Crowe's
civil rights.

14:11.784 --> 14:14.731
So... What are you gonna do?

14:28.634 --> 14:30.409
You're off
the chain, man. Good luck.

14:30.503 --> 14:31.982
Keep moving.

14:47.653 --> 14:49.394
Thank you, Jesus.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.491
<i>Cómo estás,</i> Dewey?

14:53.259 --> 14:54.897
Christ! Raylan?

14:54.994 --> 14:56.496
How's it going, amigo?

14:56.562 --> 14:57.597
We ain't <i>amigos.</i>

14:57.697 --> 14:59.404
Oh, so,
you speak a little Spanish.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.274
That must have come
in handy down in Mexico.

15:01.367 --> 15:02.778
I got no idea
what you're talking about

15:02.869 --> 15:05.042
Federals named Aguilar
who says different.

15:05.104 --> 15:07.846
Hey, my lawyer told me you come
within 1,000 feet, that's harassment.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.045
You best back up.

15:09.108 --> 15:10.246
They got cameras all over.

15:10.343 --> 15:11.913
His description
fits you to a

15:12.011 --> 15:14.582
Nazi tattoo, funny hair,
stupid-looking.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.182
That could be 10,000 people.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.025
How am I supposed to read that?
It's in Mexican.

15:21.020 --> 15:22.590
Oh, then you just have to
take my word for it.

15:22.688 --> 15:24.429
Mexican government
wants to extradite you

15:24.524 --> 15:25.935
back to Nuevo Laredo,

15:26.025 --> 15:28.369
put you on trial for the
murder of Johnny Crowder

15:28.428 --> 15:30.203
and a truckload
of others.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.709
Well, I ain't never
been to Mexico in my life.

15:32.765 --> 15:33.766
That's not what's
in question, Dewey.

15:33.866 --> 15:35.709
I didn't kill
Johnny Crowder.

15:36.202 --> 15:37.476
Well, then tell me who did.

15:37.570 --> 15:38.742
Maybe I can help you out.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.644
Yeah, I ain't a rat.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.417
And like I said,
I wasn't even there.

15:43.476 --> 15:44.887
Then you got yourself
a problem.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.722
I can give you maybe a week
to jog your memory,

15:48.548 --> 15:50.619
and then it's off
to a Mexican jail.

15:50.716 --> 15:53.287
And we both know that's a world
away from titties and tequila.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.491
Yeah, I'm clone talking.
I got a bus to catch.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.069
You're a card
in fate's right hand.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.468
Don't you see
how it's gonna play out?

16:00.560 --> 16:01.834
What the hell
does that mean?

16:01.928 --> 16:03.305
It means you
need to be smart.

16:03.396 --> 16:07.071
What I need
is a $6 blowjob!

16:07.133 --> 16:09.113
A smarter move,
I cannot imagine.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.506
Oh, you're kidding me, man.

16:43.469 --> 16:45.608
Goddamn government seizure?

17:26.479 --> 17:27.924
Get you something?

17:29.048 --> 17:30.220
Teena?

17:32.552 --> 17:33.656
Mina, Dewey.

17:34.086 --> 17:35.895
And it's, uh,
back to Abigail.

17:35.988 --> 17:37.365
What the hell happened?

17:38.491 --> 17:40.869
When Audry's closed down,
put me at the crossroads.

17:40.927 --> 17:42.270
I didn't know
which way to go.

17:42.595 --> 17:45.576
The next day,
God sent me a sign...

17:45.665 --> 17:47.110
“Now hiring."

17:47.199 --> 17:48.507
What happened to Mina?

17:48.568 --> 17:50.548
I mean Teena...
Or whatever the hell.

17:50.603 --> 17:51.604
I don't know.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.942
She wasn't
my sister, exactly.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.247
It was nice when you
played like you were, though.

17:56.342 --> 17:57.719
Huh?

17:57.777 --> 17:59.848
You want something, Dewey?
On me.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.756
Ooh, hey.
What you got in mind?

18:02.848 --> 18:05.260
Um, how about
the twofer plus two?

18:05.851 --> 18:07.797
It's two pancakes
and two eggs

18:07.887 --> 18:10.800
with either two slices of
bacon or a couple of links.

18:13.059 --> 18:15.300
Any chance I can maybe
jam one last bone in you?

18:16.395 --> 18:17.567
He bothering you?

18:17.630 --> 18:19.632
I'm okay, baby.

18:20.366 --> 18:21.538
Didn't I knock him out?

18:23.703 --> 18:24.943
Well, look at you.

18:26.205 --> 18:28.742
Got your freedom,
and then... Bam!

18:28.874 --> 18:31.650
New job, new man,
whole new deal.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.314
Not like I thought
about it too hard.

18:33.412 --> 18:36.484
Just kind of happened,
like fate or something.

18:36.582 --> 18:37.720
Nah, you saw a sign.

18:39.552 --> 18:40.963
Well, I'll be damned.

18:46.592 --> 18:47.764
Don't you get it?

18:48.728 --> 18:49.900
Don't you see?

18:50.329 --> 18:53.435
You lost it, I found it,

18:54.400 --> 18:56.073
and then I found you.

18:57.403 --> 18:58.473
It's my sign.

18:59.572 --> 19:02.075
Okay. Well,
I got to get back to it.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.314
How about that twofer?
No, no. I'm good.

19:04.410 --> 19:05.912
But thank you.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.616
Thank you!

19:07.680 --> 19:08.920
Anytime!

19:17.590 --> 19:19.263
You look pretty.

19:20.626 --> 19:22.299
Early day.
Where you off to?

19:23.195 --> 19:26.335
Tammy Lee took me back
at the beauty salon,

19:26.432 --> 19:27.502
gave me the morning slot.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.170
I didn't know
you were working.

19:29.268 --> 19:30.338
First day back.

19:30.436 --> 19:33.781
Needed a reason to get dressed
before 4:00 in the afternoon.

19:38.544 --> 19:40.387
Ava, there's something
we need to talk about.

19:40.479 --> 19:42.618
Tammy Lee's waiting.
It won't take but a minute.

19:47.553 --> 19:50.193
While you were locked up,
I had some time to think,

19:50.856 --> 19:52.164
time to look around.

19:53.459 --> 19:54.961
Harlem's dying.

19:55.795 --> 19:59.470
Mines mostly shut down,
stores closed or closing,

20:00.800 --> 20:02.837
no money, no work...

20:02.902 --> 20:04.882
Not worth having...
No... No offense.

20:05.504 --> 20:07.381
People are giving up,

20:07.473 --> 20:09.714
selling what they got,
and moving on.

20:10.209 --> 20:13.053
But if there's a chance for
us, Ava, it's not here.

20:16.082 --> 20:19.928
Now, if... If I were to
come into a good sum soon...

20:22.988 --> 20:24.365
Would you come away with me?

20:25.191 --> 20:27.068
What are you talking about?
Come away where?

20:27.159 --> 20:29.400
Costa Rica,
Brazil, maybe...

20:29.495 --> 20:31.668
Someplace they got
white sand and blue water.

20:31.731 --> 20:32.869
No.

20:32.932 --> 20:34.707
I don't want to hear this.

20:34.767 --> 20:37.338
How... How much money
you comin' into, Boyd?

20:39.171 --> 20:40.844
I don't want to hear this.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.886
I... I ain't talking about
running from trouble, Ava.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.012
Ain't gonna be no trouble.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.254
I'm talking about
leaving Harlan.

20:47.346 --> 20:48.882
Escaping.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.622
This is our home, Boyd,
the home that we're fixing up.

20:51.717 --> 20:53.094
And you want to leave?

20:53.185 --> 20:55.791
If we stay
in this ghost town, Ava,

20:55.888 --> 20:58.095
together or otherwise,

20:58.190 --> 20:59.533
how long you think
it's gonna be

20:59.592 --> 21:01.196
before we turn into
ghosts ourselves?

21:02.394 --> 21:04.874
Oh, you saying that like
we ain't dead already.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.642
I got to go to work.

21:13.572 --> 21:14.915
All right.

21:17.309 --> 21:19.789
I will be back in a jiff.

21:44.804 --> 21:47.080
What the hell, Raylan?
What are you doing here?

21:47.139 --> 21:48.812
Come to see you.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.854
What are you thinking?

21:50.943 --> 21:52.980
I mean, are you shitting me?
I work here.

21:53.078 --> 21:55.422
Yeah. Few days now.
That's good.

21:55.481 --> 21:56.653
Good place to meet.

21:56.749 --> 21:59.320
You can't do this. You can't
sneak up on me like this.

21:59.418 --> 22:01.329
First off,
I didn't sneak up.

22:01.420 --> 22:02.524
Second, yes, loan.

22:02.621 --> 22:04.601
What if Boyd came?
What would you do then?

22:04.657 --> 22:07.263
Boyd would not be caught
dead near a beauty parlor,

22:07.326 --> 22:10.330
though I bet he's thrilled to
get 10% off his hair spray.

22:10.429 --> 22:11.931
Funny.
I use a paste.

22:11.997 --> 22:15.001
I don't think I can do this.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.011
What you need to do
is contact me...

22:18.003 --> 22:20.381
Particularly when I
reach out again and again

22:20.472 --> 22:21.951
and I don't
hear from you.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.452
That way,
there are no surprises.

22:24.443 --> 22:25.513
Fine.

22:27.613 --> 22:28.853
Sit down.

22:35.387 --> 22:36.957
I'm afraid to
look him in the eye,

22:37.022 --> 22:38.558
say good morning
the wrong way,

22:38.657 --> 22:40.864
give him cause to put a
hole through my head.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.065
Why would he have any
reason to do such a thing?

22:43.162 --> 22:44.732
I don't know.

22:44.830 --> 22:46.537
Do I have to know?

22:46.632 --> 22:47.975
I mean,
can't I just have a feeling?

22:48.033 --> 22:49.171
How's he acting?

22:49.235 --> 22:51.408
Doing anything different?

22:51.503 --> 22:55.315
Making changes, talking about
buying a new car, boat,

22:55.374 --> 22:57.012
making big plans?

22:58.811 --> 23:00.518
He bought a $300 tow truck.

23:00.579 --> 23:01.649
There you go.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.250
How's that for a plan?
Could be something.

23:03.349 --> 23:05.329
He could fix it up, sell it.

23:05.384 --> 23:08.160
Yeah. It'd be a $20 profit.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.194
Okay.

23:13.325 --> 23:14.497
The reason I'm here...

23:15.160 --> 23:17.106
Dewey's out of prison.
He's gonna come and see Boyd.

23:17.196 --> 23:18.402
I want you to
keep an eye on him.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.844
Fine. Is that all?

23:21.901 --> 23:23.039
That's all.

23:24.003 --> 23:25.243
That, and be cool.

23:26.939 --> 23:29.010
We're setting up
a command post at Arlo's.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.747
You need anything,
I'm that close.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.794
Hey!

23:47.893 --> 23:49.270
Where the hell is everybody?

23:49.361 --> 23:51.238
Yeah. Back here.

23:51.297 --> 23:52.799
Well,
what's going on?

23:52.898 --> 23:54.104
Earl and The Pig
went to eat.

23:54.199 --> 23:56.270
They did what?
They said they?! be quick.

23:56.368 --> 23:58.575
Well, call them and tell
them to get back here.

23:58.637 --> 23:59.775
And to bring me something!

23:59.872 --> 24:02.216
I'm so hungry, I could eat the
ass out of a low-flying duck.

24:05.811 --> 24:07.222
Why you still standing
there like that?

24:08.714 --> 24:10.751
Found him outside,
grabbed him up.

24:18.724 --> 24:20.465
It's good to
see you again, Boyd.

24:20.559 --> 24:21.731
I was hoping we could talk.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.478
Hey!

24:28.567 --> 24:30.274
Frisk him.

24:30.336 --> 24:31.781
Boyd!

24:31.837 --> 24:33.248
I come in peace.

24:36.508 --> 24:38.146
He's clean.

24:38.243 --> 24:39.586
How did you get here?

24:39.645 --> 24:41.318
What do you mean?
How did you get here?

24:41.413 --> 24:43.324
I... I walked.

24:43.415 --> 24:45.588
From prison?
The Pancake House.

24:46.151 --> 24:47.653
I left the pen
yesterday by bus.

24:47.753 --> 24:50.495
I... I came partway in,
and then I hot-wired a car.

24:50.589 --> 24:51.795
What kind of car?

24:51.857 --> 24:53.530
I don't know.
The one with the horse.

24:53.625 --> 24:55.662
Toyota? Ford Mustang.
You lying to me.

24:55.761 --> 24:56.762
I ain't lying.

24:57.262 --> 24:58.832
Cassette player or CD?
Cassette.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.501
Any of them lying around?

25:00.599 --> 25:02.943
ARS Live, man,
<i>Champagne Jam.</i>

25:03.869 --> 25:05.712
- I love that record.
- Me, too.

25:06.472 --> 25:08.349
Why you asking
all these questions, Boyd?

25:08.440 --> 25:11.182
I know I didn't
leave you on good terms.

25:11.276 --> 25:12.653
That is correct.

25:12.711 --> 25:15.783
Robbing me at gunpoint
was not on good terms.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.828
Yeah, and I'm sorry
about that, Boyd.

25:17.883 --> 25:19.453
I'm real sorry. But...

25:22.354 --> 25:23.958
I found this.

25:25.491 --> 25:28.472
This is the only link
I have with family, Boyd.

25:29.294 --> 25:32.503
I gave it to someone special,
and the bitch lost it.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.474
But now it's found.

25:36.301 --> 25:38.042
That's a powerful sign, Boyd.

25:39.138 --> 25:41.379
My turtle dog come back to me,

25:42.374 --> 25:44.149
and I come back to you.

25:45.244 --> 25:46.314
See?

25:47.079 --> 25:48.717
Now, I got to talk
to you about something.

25:48.814 --> 25:52.523
Only thing that matters is what
I want to talk about, Dewey.

25:54.987 --> 25:57.058
Now, I want to know

25:57.156 --> 26:00.831
exactly why you're not sitting
in a prison cell as we speak.

26:03.262 --> 26:04.502
I was there, Dewey.

26:05.197 --> 26:07.040
I heard you say
you killed Wade Messer.

26:07.099 --> 26:09.909
Now, all of a sudden, you're
here, sitting in my bar.

26:10.002 --> 26:11.777
They can't touch a hair
on Dewey Crowe's head,

26:11.870 --> 26:13.042
else it's harassment,

26:13.105 --> 26:14.243
on account of the civil suit

26:14.339 --> 26:16.114
that I won against
the federals,

26:16.208 --> 26:17.778
particularly Raylan Givens.

26:18.744 --> 26:20.189
Well, what do you want?

26:24.116 --> 26:25.925
I just want back in, Boyd.

26:28.687 --> 26:29.893
I just want you
to trust me again.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.028
Carl.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.062
Come on.

26:55.047 --> 26:56.048
Tow truck?

26:56.115 --> 26:57.116
Tow truck.

26:57.216 --> 26:59.389
Wasn't Crowder involved
running drugs in a tow truck?

26:59.451 --> 27:00.953
Like Hot Rod Dunham
before him.

27:01.420 --> 27:03.730
Well, if he's still in the drug-running
business, might explain this.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.902
That's Cyrus Boone,
known dealer in Harlan.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.768
I got those
about 36 hours ago.

27:09.328 --> 27:11.239
Maybe we should
pay Cyrus a visit.

27:11.730 --> 27:13.175
This a friend of yours?

27:19.838 --> 27:21.579
Never seen him before
in my life.

27:27.012 --> 27:28.650
Hey! Good morning!

27:29.915 --> 27:32.293
Where you from?
Maryland.

27:32.351 --> 27:34.126
Way it works hereabouts,

27:34.186 --> 27:37.998
a man comes onto another man's
land with no seeming purpose,

27:38.090 --> 27:40.366
that man might be
taken as a trespasser,

27:40.459 --> 27:41.494
might get himself shot.

27:42.027 --> 27:44.667
Just assessing the land,
devising a number,

27:44.763 --> 27:47.039
unless I misread the sign
on the road...

27:47.132 --> 27:48.509
"For sale by owner."

27:48.600 --> 27:50.841
You are the owner?
De facto.

27:50.936 --> 27:53.041
You might want to reconsider before
threatening a potential buyer.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.777
House has been on
the market for some time.

27:55.841 --> 27:57.184
Is that because
you can't let it go

27:57.276 --> 27:58.550
or because it's stuck
in a bad market?

28:00.045 --> 28:01.786
You don't strike me
as the sentimental type.

28:01.847 --> 28:03.622
I'm gonna go with bad market.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.993
But I am prepared to pay
your full asking price

28:07.052 --> 28:09.123
in cash today.

28:11.056 --> 28:14.629
And by today,
you mean immediately.

28:15.460 --> 28:16.632
Indeed.

28:18.897 --> 28:20.843
Forgive me if I ain't
the run-of-the-mill tater tot

28:20.899 --> 28:22.207
whose eyes go all pinwheels

28:22.301 --> 28:23.712
at a stack of stolen money.

28:24.002 --> 28:26.380
Stolen?
I am offended, sir.

28:26.471 --> 28:28.348
You don't even want to
come up and see the house.

28:28.407 --> 28:29.818
I can see it fine from here.

28:29.908 --> 28:32.514
It doesn't have,
uh, curb appeal.

28:32.578 --> 28:34.819
My daddy pretty much
having let it go to ruin,

28:34.880 --> 28:36.325
but it does have history.

28:37.316 --> 28:41.230
My kin moved to this land
from Miller's Creek in 1903.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.732
A lot of them gave their
lives to hold on to it,

28:43.822 --> 28:47.065
a couple of them buried
right up there by the house.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.833
I stand corrected.
You are the sentimental type.

28:51.029 --> 28:53.509
Alas, all things must pass.

28:54.533 --> 28:56.240
What do you say, friend?
Isn't it time to sell?

28:56.335 --> 28:57.439
It is time to sell.

28:58.237 --> 28:59.580
But not to you.

29:02.841 --> 29:05.344
You have second thoughts, you'll
have no trouble finding me.

29:05.410 --> 29:06.946
You have no idea.

29:15.387 --> 29:16.627
What's the call on Cyrus?

29:19.591 --> 29:20.695
Yo, man.

29:21.126 --> 29:22.730
You hook me up?
Damn, Crackpot.

29:22.794 --> 29:24.796
What, you on the fast train?
I just saw you yesterday.

29:24.896 --> 29:26.534
So?
"So?"

29:26.932 --> 29:29.538
So, if you OD, it's gonna be
your own goddamn fault.

29:30.135 --> 29:31.546
You hear me?

29:32.904 --> 29:34.577
Don't be
goose-necking in here.

29:35.307 --> 29:36.547
Come on.

29:41.546 --> 29:42.581
You understand?

29:43.448 --> 29:44.950
Shit.

29:46.418 --> 29:48.796
Yeah. Yeah. I understand.

29:49.488 --> 29:50.762
I'm cool!

29:59.331 --> 30:00.969
Halt. U.S. Marshals.

30:11.476 --> 30:12.580
What?

30:13.745 --> 30:14.746
No Cyrus.

30:15.280 --> 30:17.658
What does that mean?
He was abducted by aliens?

30:17.749 --> 30:18.853
He wasn't
answering his phone.

30:18.950 --> 30:20.759
Earl just got back.
The house is empty.

30:22.287 --> 30:23.425
I don't like it, Boyd.

30:24.423 --> 30:25.766
What are we doing?

30:26.124 --> 30:27.194
Are we really
doing this thing?

30:27.759 --> 30:28.863
Yeah.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.470
Why?
Because.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.812
Any more questions?
Yeah.

30:36.702 --> 30:39.012
How we gonna get away with
this with the feds up our ass?

30:39.604 --> 30:40.776
We needed Cyrus.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.779
8 ball, side pocket.

30:53.885 --> 30:55.831
You want back in?

30:55.887 --> 30:58.197
I got a job that needs doing.

30:58.290 --> 30:59.633
Anything you say, Boyd.

31:00.659 --> 31:01.967
Anything.

31:03.028 --> 31:04.405
Hell, yeah.

31:18.377 --> 31:19.378
See that?

31:23.348 --> 31:26.557
Good things happen to those
who wait for stupid.

31:26.651 --> 31:28.597
I believe that was in
the Sermon on the Mount.

31:28.687 --> 31:30.496
We get Dewey transporting,
we get our leverage back.

31:30.655 --> 31:32.726
He tells a judge about
Crowder-on-Crowder crime.

31:32.824 --> 31:34.497
You want to follow
Crowder or Crowe?

31:35.560 --> 31:37.198
Your call.

31:38.196 --> 31:39.231
Let's go after Dewey.

32:11.096 --> 32:14.305
You know, he once told me he worked
at Disney World dressed as Goofy...

32:14.633 --> 32:16.112
In a water-skiing show.

32:17.369 --> 32:19.371
Well, some guys
just peak too early.

32:29.214 --> 32:31.285
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

32:44.229 --> 32:46.573
Want to hang back,
let KSP do their thing?

32:46.631 --> 32:47.769
Yeah, why not?

32:49.234 --> 32:50.474
How you doing there?

32:50.569 --> 32:51.741
Do you mind
steppin' out of your vehicle?

32:52.437 --> 32:53.507
I do.

32:53.605 --> 32:54.913
We need to
search your vehicle.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.316
What, this vehicle?

32:56.408 --> 32:58.183
License and registration,
please.

32:58.276 --> 33:00.256
Not today, friend.
What?

33:00.612 --> 33:02.592
Oh, they didn't tell you
who I am?

33:03.348 --> 33:05.919
I am Dewey goddamn Crowe,

33:05.984 --> 33:07.986
and I'm gonna keep on driving

33:08.086 --> 33:09.861
so I can save
the state of Kentucky

33:09.955 --> 33:12.458
and the government of
the United States of America

33:12.524 --> 33:15.164
another $300,000

33:15.260 --> 33:17.763
for harassment,
"nelgigence,"

33:17.829 --> 33:19.365
and general "mal-fee-essence".

33:19.931 --> 33:22.207
So, have a nice day
and kiss my ass.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.208
Shit.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.255
You all right, Dewey?

34:12.717 --> 34:13.821
Raylan?

34:16.855 --> 34:18.197
1,000 feet?

34:18.255 --> 34:20.668
I'm pretty sure that's
just a figure of speech.

34:22.726 --> 34:24.070
Are you okay?

34:24.663 --> 34:26.074
I'm fine.
Good.

34:26.164 --> 34:27.574
Now get your ass
out of that truck.

34:27.666 --> 34:30.612
No. You can't touch me.
I'm Teflon.

34:34.339 --> 34:35.373
I'll only ask once.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.853
I'm gonna help you
out of your vehicle.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.411
You understand?

34:39.511 --> 34:41.684
What I understand
is my constitutional...

34:43.281 --> 34:44.521
Ohh!

34:44.583 --> 34:46.062
Oh, you broke my jaw!

34:46.518 --> 34:49.362
Goddamn! You broke my jaw!

34:49.420 --> 34:51.094
What'd you have to
do that for?

34:51.188 --> 34:53.533
What's in the bag?
What bag?

34:53.592 --> 34:55.594
That bag, dipshit.

34:55.694 --> 34:57.867
I've never seen
that bag before in my life.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.408
Dewey, you're in
a world of shit.

34:59.898 --> 35:02.708
First, you're facing extradition
to Mexico. Second...

35:02.767 --> 35:05.111
Second, whatever we find in
this bag, that's on you.

35:05.203 --> 35:07.376
If we find drugs in that bag,
what do we call that?

35:07.706 --> 35:10.152
Transportation and distribution
of illegal substances.

35:10.241 --> 35:11.743
That don't look
good on a resume.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.118
No, it does not.

35:13.211 --> 35:15.122
How many years
would he be in for that?

35:15.213 --> 35:17.159
- Well, he's not a first-time offender.
- No.

35:17.248 --> 35:18.921
It's got to be
at least seven to 10.

35:19.050 --> 35:20.996
Depends on the judge. Could be more.
Uh-huh.

35:22.320 --> 35:24.061
Maybe just let
KSP handle this.

35:24.222 --> 35:25.394
Maybe.

35:27.659 --> 35:30.663
Dewey, you think Boyd
gives a shit about you?

35:31.096 --> 35:32.905
Boyd gives
a big shit about me.

35:37.068 --> 35:38.342
Open the bag.

35:40.772 --> 35:42.752
I heard you the first time.

35:54.085 --> 35:55.189
Where is it?

35:55.286 --> 35:56.458
Where is what?

35:56.521 --> 35:59.365
I don't know, but whatever
it is, it ain't here.

36:02.460 --> 36:04.030
Which bank did you say
you saw Boyd in?

36:04.763 --> 36:06.436
First River.

36:10.268 --> 36:11.542
Let's do this.

36:23.515 --> 36:24.653
Lick the floor!

36:25.884 --> 36:27.386
I said now!

36:29.788 --> 36:31.290
I said down!

36:32.824 --> 36:34.201
That means you, too,
Dolly Parton.

36:35.560 --> 36:36.971
Please...

36:43.201 --> 36:46.205
All right, everybody, keep
your head down and your mouth shut!

36:46.304 --> 36:47.681
This will all be over
in a minute!

36:47.739 --> 36:49.013
Nobody gets hurt!

36:57.916 --> 36:59.054
Got it?

37:00.485 --> 37:01.589
Got it.

37:10.428 --> 37:11.600
Let's do it.

38:09.988 --> 38:11.626
Yeah, let's follow Dewey.

38:11.723 --> 38:13.794
Yeah. Good call, Gutterson.

38:42.420 --> 38:43.763
You reached out.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.192
Here I am. See?

38:47.192 --> 38:48.364
I can listen.

38:48.459 --> 38:51.201
Why just
the security-deposit boxes?

38:51.296 --> 38:52.673
What's that,
a riddle?

38:54.265 --> 38:56.267
Come on, Raylan.
It's late, and I'm cold.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.211
Was it Boyd's idea
to send me after the truck,

38:58.303 --> 38:59.338
or was that you?

38:59.437 --> 39:01.644
I don't... I don't know
what we're talking about.

39:01.706 --> 39:04.778
We're talking about the bank job
Boyd pulled off this afternoon.

39:05.276 --> 39:06.448
First I heard of it.

39:06.477 --> 39:08.684
That's gonna be your line?
It's the truth.

39:08.780 --> 39:10.225
If it ain't,
you're going back to prison.

39:10.315 --> 39:11.555
Worse, you'll be a suspect.

39:11.649 --> 39:12.855
Suspect?

39:12.951 --> 39:14.453
Yeah. Criminal co-conspirator.

39:14.519 --> 39:16.692
You'll be looking at Boyd's
charges, plus a few of your own.

39:16.788 --> 39:18.199
If someone gets killed,
that's on you, too.

39:18.289 --> 39:20.530
Jesus, Raylan,
I'm not lying.

39:20.625 --> 39:21.797
I'm prone to believe you.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.498
The problem is,
if you didn't know about it,

39:23.561 --> 39:25.507
then you're of no use to us,
in which case,

39:25.563 --> 39:27.008
you're going back to prison.

39:27.065 --> 39:28.373
You understand your dilemma?

39:29.834 --> 39:31.643
Ava, am I being clear?

39:31.703 --> 39:33.376
Yes, Raylan,
crystal clear.

39:33.471 --> 39:35.473
I'm just having a nervous
collapse here, is all.

39:35.540 --> 39:36.644
You don't have that luxury.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.881
You need to pull yourself
together and do the job.

39:39.744 --> 39:42.520
So, I should just start
asking probing questions

39:42.580 --> 39:44.355
like I'm curious, like...

39:44.415 --> 39:46.554
Like it ain't about
anything particular?

39:46.651 --> 39:49.222
Hell, I was in Brigadoon
In seventh grade.

39:49.320 --> 39:51.823
I guess I can act.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.062
Ava, I know you.

39:54.325 --> 39:56.566
You knew me then.
What do you know now?

39:56.661 --> 39:58.504
Then, now...
It's the same.

40:00.565 --> 40:02.067
It's the same.

40:04.068 --> 40:05.945
You remember the day
I came back to Harlan?

40:06.037 --> 40:07.243
Hardly.

40:07.338 --> 40:08.749
I recall it well.

40:08.840 --> 40:11.753
You opened your screen door,
kissed me, and invited me in,

40:11.843 --> 40:14.687
then showed me a bloodstain
on your dining-room carpet.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.915
Bowman.

40:17.015 --> 40:18.756
Christ, that was
a long time ago.

40:18.850 --> 40:20.693
You recall the days
leading up to it?

40:22.186 --> 40:23.893
It was clear to me.

40:25.456 --> 40:27.959
I knew I would shoot him.
I'd had enough.

40:29.627 --> 40:31.368
And I just had to
see it through.

40:31.429 --> 40:33.409
You made him dinner,
a whole spread...

40:33.464 --> 40:35.876
His favorites, if I recall.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.038
He was delighted.

40:37.101 --> 40:39.047
He had no sense
of your intention.

40:40.271 --> 40:42.217
He never saw it coming.

40:45.376 --> 40:47.378
Because he believed me.

40:49.113 --> 40:52.219
Because I acted like everything
was the way it always was.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.957
Because he had never
suspected otherwise.

40:56.721 --> 40:58.223
No, he did not.

41:04.162 --> 41:05.232
See?

41:06.331 --> 41:07.935
I know you, Ava.

41:09.233 --> 41:11.110
I know you can do this.

41:12.136 --> 41:13.615
So you damn well better.

41:32.857 --> 41:35.030
What the hell, Boyd?
What is this?

41:36.361 --> 41:37.704
Paperwork?

41:38.496 --> 41:40.134
Goddamn notebook?

41:40.198 --> 41:42.872
Looks like a ledger,
some deeds.

41:43.534 --> 41:44.706
We got the wrong box.

41:46.304 --> 41:47.840
No, we got the right box.

41:48.373 --> 41:49.681
This isn't money.

41:50.208 --> 41:51.619
Where's all the money?

42:01.786 --> 42:03.060
Well, you're lucky.

42:03.154 --> 42:06.363
Leslie's not supposed to let people
in here that might upset me.

42:06.457 --> 42:08.300
Sorry. I should have
come a week ago.

42:08.359 --> 42:10.669
Me who's sorry.
All this shit.

42:11.963 --> 42:13.374
Slipping in my old age.

42:13.464 --> 42:15.876
He didn't get you
'cause you're slipping, Ari.

42:15.967 --> 42:17.503
I brought you something.

42:18.169 --> 42:20.308
I don't suppose
that's doctor recommended.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.373
Civil war doctor, maybe.

42:22.473 --> 42:24.714
You want to abstain,
I'll drink in your honor.

42:24.809 --> 42:27.153
Just waft the fumes
in my direction.

42:27.211 --> 42:28.815
To your speedy recovery.

42:30.314 --> 42:31.884
So, how's it going?
Ah...

42:31.983 --> 42:33.985
Willa has been
baptized a Catholic.

42:34.052 --> 42:36.032
Mmm!
That grandma's idea?

42:36.087 --> 42:37.828
She fears for
her immortal soul.

42:37.889 --> 42:38.993
Well, do you blame her?

42:39.057 --> 42:41.037
Kid's got half your DNA.

42:42.260 --> 42:43.568
How's work?

42:43.661 --> 42:44.901
Going after Boyd Crowder,

42:44.996 --> 42:47.875
at a snail's pace, I might
add, so not to spook him.

42:48.833 --> 42:52.906
That explains why you haven't scooted
down to see your papist daughter.

42:53.004 --> 42:56.542
Big deal now...
RICO case, all eyes watching.

42:56.607 --> 42:58.416
Got to be neat and tidy,
by the book.

42:58.509 --> 43:00.455
Not how you'd like it done.

43:00.545 --> 43:02.286
Doubt that's how
we'll get him.

43:02.380 --> 43:04.951
Your C.I. in the Crowder camp
isn't some help?

43:06.350 --> 43:08.455
Yeah. I know more
than I let on.

43:09.187 --> 43:13.932
And, no, I would not have green-lit
Ava Crowder as said C.I.,

43:14.025 --> 43:15.595
nor you as her handler.

43:16.427 --> 43:19.101
But I'm not in charge
at the moment,

43:20.031 --> 43:21.567
might not be again,

43:22.567 --> 43:24.103
don't know why
I'm even interested,

43:24.202 --> 43:26.273
except out of
sheer damn boredom.

43:26.370 --> 43:27.542
Cheers.

43:34.445 --> 43:35.788
Well, I know
you didn't come here

43:35.880 --> 43:37.826
just to check
on my condition

43:37.915 --> 43:40.987
and jeopardize my convalescence
with some high-class bourbon.

43:42.587 --> 43:45.261
Remind me why
I'm gonna be patient.

43:45.323 --> 43:47.826
Not back him into a corner
and force him to draw?

43:48.292 --> 43:50.294
Plug him face-to-face.

43:51.496 --> 43:52.634
Get it done quick.

43:53.397 --> 43:54.899
Save us all a big headache.

43:54.966 --> 43:57.310
Make the world a better
place for a little while.

43:58.803 --> 44:00.578
Yeah, you could kill Boyd.

44:03.107 --> 44:06.418
Then you'd be headed down to
Florida without a star and a gun.

44:09.514 --> 44:11.357
And you might be
seeing your daughter

44:11.449 --> 44:14.430
through the glass on visitation
days at the penitentiary.

44:19.590 --> 44:22.764
Or, Raylan,
there's another way it goes,

44:23.661 --> 44:26.835
where you try and you fail
and the bullet finds you.

44:27.598 --> 44:28.804
Unlikely.

44:28.866 --> 44:31.312
I know you think so,

44:31.369 --> 44:32.871
but if you'll allow me...

44:34.105 --> 44:35.948
You get to be my age,

44:36.474 --> 44:38.385
do the job
as long as you do...

44:40.545 --> 44:42.650
Sometimes it just
doesn't go your way.

44:49.287 --> 44:50.891
- You tell him I got to see him!
- All right.

44:50.988 --> 44:52.194
You tell him
it's Dewey Crowe!

44:52.290 --> 44:54.167
All right!

44:54.225 --> 44:56.068
It's Dewey Crowe.
What the hell, Boyd?

44:56.160 --> 44:57.332
What the hell, what?

44:57.395 --> 44:58.840
You set me up.
How you figure that?

44:58.896 --> 45:00.967
The Staties and the Feds
were waiting for me.

45:01.032 --> 45:03.034
They knew I was coming
before they even saw me.

45:03.134 --> 45:05.205
You said you wanted back in,
so I gave you a job.

45:05.403 --> 45:08.009
You told me what was
in that bag was important!

45:08.072 --> 45:10.211
I told you that
the job was important.

45:10.308 --> 45:12.015
What,
carrying your underpants?

45:12.076 --> 45:13.180
Well, it hadn't have
been underpants,

45:13.411 --> 45:15.584
your sorry ass would be
sitting in jail right now!

45:16.247 --> 45:17.726
What in the hell
happened to your face?

45:17.815 --> 45:19.317
Raylan broke my jaw.

45:19.984 --> 45:21.054
Why?

45:21.152 --> 45:22.688
I don't know why!

45:23.821 --> 45:24.993
But I'm...
I'm tired of it!

45:28.659 --> 45:30.229
I'm tired of it.

45:35.499 --> 45:37.001
You my friend, Boyd?

45:38.102 --> 45:39.410
Yeah, I'm your friend.

45:42.773 --> 45:44.411
I got to talk to you, Boyd.

45:46.344 --> 45:47.550
About...

45:49.614 --> 45:53.926
Mexico,
and I... I...

45:55.453 --> 45:58.593
And I don't know.
I just... I'm tired.

46:00.858 --> 46:01.962
What do you want, Dewey?

46:06.731 --> 46:08.142
I want to go back.

46:08.866 --> 46:11.472
I want it to be like
it used to be at the church,

46:12.203 --> 46:14.046
when we was
Crowder's commandos.

46:14.105 --> 46:15.277
You, me, and Devil.

46:15.373 --> 46:16.477
Yes!

46:16.574 --> 46:19.282
And the pork brothers,
giving me no end of shit.

46:20.978 --> 46:23.788
The music cranked so loud

46:23.881 --> 46:27.055
that we almost blew
the roof off that old church.

46:29.053 --> 46:31.829
Bombing around
in my Cadillac

46:31.922 --> 46:34.402
and making war plans
and drinking 'shine.

46:39.163 --> 46:41.143
Why can't it be
like that again, Boyd?

46:42.500 --> 46:45.481
Those were simple days,
good days.

46:45.569 --> 46:48.516
Weren't they? They were good days.
They were.

46:53.844 --> 46:55.482
Carl,

46:55.579 --> 46:58.685
go out front and pour me and Dewey
a couple glasses, would you?

46:58.783 --> 47:00.456
Come on over here.

47:01.319 --> 47:02.491
Have a seat.

47:08.426 --> 47:10.702
Dewey, I'm gonna tell you
something in confidence.

47:11.862 --> 47:13.933
It's all coming to an end.

47:14.832 --> 47:16.175
What do you mean?

47:16.267 --> 47:17.678
Well, look around you.

47:18.703 --> 47:21.445
Whatever it was
we was hoping for,

47:22.106 --> 47:24.450
those days have
long since passed.

47:25.609 --> 47:26.883
Now, I...

47:27.511 --> 47:29.320
I ain't saying
I'm giving up,

47:30.614 --> 47:34.653
but I am saying I never thought
that it would be this hard.

47:37.188 --> 47:40.226
It seems like maybe those
good clays are gone forever.

47:43.227 --> 47:45.229
I don't know, man.
I feel like...

47:45.963 --> 47:48.170
I feel like we can make it
like it was before.

47:51.469 --> 47:53.005
I want to
show you something.

48:02.747 --> 48:04.351
You see that man
right there?

48:05.249 --> 48:07.058
That's my granddaddy.

48:07.551 --> 48:08.928
Fella next to him
is my great uncle,

48:09.019 --> 48:10.430
with all their union brothers.

48:12.189 --> 48:14.032
Now, Harlan county
was a boomtown then.

48:15.326 --> 48:20.241
Those men saw hard,
bitter times, Dewey Crowe,

48:21.832 --> 48:23.903
but they also saw a future.

48:28.739 --> 48:32.209
Now, you look closely,
you can see it in their eyes.

48:34.512 --> 48:36.219
Go on. Take a look.

48:36.280 --> 48:37.850
Can't even see their eyes.

48:44.422 --> 48:45.423
Boyd!

48:50.094 --> 48:51.198
Whew.

48:54.265 --> 48:57.075
You, uh, think he was a...

48:57.134 --> 48:58.408
A rat for the federals?

48:58.969 --> 49:00.949
I think I couldn't
trust him anymore.

49:04.742 --> 49:07.621
Now, they'll follow me,
no doubt,

49:07.711 --> 49:09.054
but you be sure.

49:10.381 --> 49:12.554
You wait 20 minutes
after I leave.

49:13.751 --> 49:15.389
Then you roll him up
in a carpet,

49:15.453 --> 49:17.558
and you make him disappear.
