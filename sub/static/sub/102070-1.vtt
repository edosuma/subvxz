WEBVTT

01:44.030 --> 01:44.863
Oh hello.

01:46.698 --> 01:47.433
Hello.

01:47.466 --> 01:48.566
Who are you?

01:51.203 --> 01:51.903
Hey!

01:52.972 --> 01:53.973
Yeah?

01:56.042 --> 01:56.942
Is this your dog?

02:00.578 --> 02:01.313
Sorry, what?

02:02.580 --> 02:03.748
Is this your dog?

02:08.154 --> 02:09.554
What?

02:09.587 --> 02:10.389
What?

02:12.091 --> 02:13.459
You're smiling.

02:13.492 --> 02:17.829
Oh, no, I didn't except
your accent to be your voice.

02:18.497 --> 02:20.399
I mean, that's all.

02:21.666 --> 02:23.202
What's wrong with it?

02:23.235 --> 02:24.003
Nothing.

02:26.338 --> 02:29.141
I was
so sad the day I met you.

02:44.622 --> 02:46.325
I can't remember why.

02:49.528 --> 02:52.431
Just stop listening.
Stop thinking.

02:53.865 --> 02:54.632
Tune it out.

02:59.038 --> 03:02.807
What's that thing you're
supposed to do? Count sheep?

03:02.841 --> 03:06.011
One sheep, two sheep,

03:06.045 --> 03:08.880
black sheep, blue sheep.

03:13.519 --> 03:14.320
Blue.

03:16.055 --> 03:18.958
I wonder if Blue ever worries.

03:18.991 --> 03:20.526
Nah.

03:20.559 --> 03:21.527
Blue doesn't worry.

03:26.999 --> 03:28.833
All these little pieces.

03:30.569 --> 03:32.871
So much to remember.

03:36.976 --> 03:39.478
That smoke smell in Jude's hair.

03:39.512 --> 03:41.313
Samantha telling
stories of the road

03:41.347 --> 03:44.550
and Ben agonizing
over the playlist.

03:47.852 --> 03:48.720
What was the song?

03:52.258 --> 03:54.393
I can't remember anymore.

03:56.595 --> 03:58.197
Focus on the important things.

04:04.170 --> 04:05.237
Jude Andrew Williams.

04:09.542 --> 04:11.377
We were married on
October 14, 2021.

04:13.078 --> 04:14.113
A Thursday.

04:33.065 --> 04:35.700
I should be writing this down.

05:03.062 --> 05:05.130
Everyone in, act like
you like each other.

05:05.164 --> 05:06.432
Pressed in tighter.

05:06.465 --> 05:08.133
Tighter, tighter, tighter.

05:08.167 --> 05:09.568
Everyone say "cliche"!

05:09.602 --> 05:11.437
Cliche!

05:11.470 --> 05:13.038
- I got you a drink.
- Oh, thank you.

05:13.072 --> 05:15.074
- Emma, get in here.
- Okay, yeah.

05:15.107 --> 05:16.408
Tim, get in!

05:16.442 --> 05:17.775
Okay.

05:21.013 --> 05:22.615
- Oh.
- Wait.

05:22.648 --> 05:23.716
One, two, three, cheese!

05:23.748 --> 05:25.750
Cheese!

05:25.783 --> 05:26.986
Thank you.

05:27.019 --> 05:28.254
- Be right back.
- Send that to me.

05:28.287 --> 05:29.288
- I'm sending it.
- Okay, good.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.660
You okay?

05:34.693 --> 05:36.894
- Yeah.
- He's bitter.

05:36.929 --> 05:40.065
Uh, I just got ahold of
work and I'll be two seconds.

05:44.270 --> 05:45.304
Hello?

05:45.337 --> 05:46.705
<i>Hey, it's Jude.</i>

05:48.840 --> 05:50.175
Are you calling me?

05:50.209 --> 05:51.277
<i>Uh, yeah.</i>

05:51.310 --> 05:52.478
<i>Why? Is this not a good time?</i>

05:52.511 --> 05:56.015
No, no, no, just that
cowards like me only text.

05:56.048 --> 05:58.284
<i>Oh, well,
well, I did text,</i>

05:58.317 --> 06:00.619
<i>but then I realized
I wasn't gonna get</i>

06:00.653 --> 06:02.354
<i>to hear that cool accent again.</i>

06:02.388 --> 06:03.589
<i>So, uh...</i>

06:03.622 --> 06:06.292
Um, um.

06:06.325 --> 06:07.693
I'm at a Halloween
party so sorry

06:07.726 --> 06:09.194
if it's a little bit loud.

06:09.228 --> 06:10.362
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

06:10.396 --> 06:11.297
<i>How is yours?</i>

06:11.330 --> 06:12.431
Yeah, it's fine.

06:12.464 --> 06:14.199
Just a typical Halloween party.

06:14.233 --> 06:17.636
<i>Cool, well, uh you
better get back to it then.</i>

06:19.238 --> 06:20.439
Actually it's a bag of wank.

06:20.472 --> 06:21.774
<i>It's what?</i>

06:21.806 --> 06:23.142
It's just shit,
it's really shit.

06:25.877 --> 06:28.647
<i>I bet you my Halloween
party is 10 times worse.</i>

06:32.318 --> 06:33.285
Prove it.

06:34.386 --> 06:35.721
Can't it wait till tomorrow?

06:35.754 --> 06:37.122
A dog might've
been hit by a car,

06:37.156 --> 06:38.524
the details are unclear.

06:38.557 --> 06:39.458
Do you want me
to come with you?

06:39.491 --> 06:40.693
No, no, no, no, you stay here.

06:40.726 --> 06:42.328
Have fun and I'll
speak to you tomorrow.

06:46.665 --> 06:47.433
Hey!

06:49.335 --> 06:51.236
Are you George Washington?

06:51.270 --> 06:52.304
No.

06:52.338 --> 06:53.706
No, I'm Claude Bourgelat.

06:53.739 --> 06:54.973
Who's Clark Bergo...

06:55.007 --> 06:57.242
- Who's Claude-
- Come on up,

06:57.276 --> 06:58.043
I'll buzz you.

06:58.077 --> 06:59.144
Which way am I going?

06:59.178 --> 07:00.312
Just that way.

07:08.587 --> 07:12.191
Claude Bourgelat, the
French veterinary surgeon

07:12.224 --> 07:13.726
who actually opened
up the very first

07:13.759 --> 07:16.195
veterinary practices in Lyon.

07:16.228 --> 07:17.262
Lyon.

07:19.765 --> 07:21.233
Is your costume a
guy who Googles things

07:21.266 --> 07:22.534
and pretends he
already knew 'em?

07:22.568 --> 07:24.737
That is my costume.

07:25.938 --> 07:27.206
Yeah, funny, you're
actually the only

07:27.239 --> 07:28.207
person to get it right.

07:33.911 --> 07:36.715
- Shall I.. Can I?
- Yeah, come meet

07:36.749 --> 07:37.983
these clowns, come on.

07:38.984 --> 07:40.419
Welcome.

07:41.553 --> 07:42.321
Come, come.

07:46.225 --> 07:48.193
Everybody, this is Emma.

07:48.227 --> 07:49.261
Emma, this is everybody.

07:52.398 --> 07:54.099
Jude Andrew Williams.

07:54.133 --> 07:55.234
He always had a
camera in his hand

07:55.267 --> 07:57.269
and a photograph in his mind.

07:57.302 --> 07:59.271
Yeah, come on, man!

08:00.472 --> 08:02.074
He
could seem guarded at first

08:02.107 --> 08:04.576
but if you ever needed to
know how he really felt

08:04.610 --> 08:06.945
you could just look
at his pictures.

08:24.129 --> 08:28.934
It was hard to believe that
was only the beginning.

09:05.504 --> 09:06.705
Can I kiss you?

09:11.310 --> 09:12.878
I'm not available.

09:12.911 --> 09:14.880
Right. Tom.

09:14.913 --> 09:15.647
Tim.

09:15.747 --> 09:16.950
Tim.

09:16.982 --> 09:18.150
That's even worse.

09:20.652 --> 09:21.553
So, do you love him?

09:21.587 --> 09:22.387
- No.
- No?

09:23.856 --> 09:25.390
Then why are you with him?

09:25.424 --> 09:28.694
It's just what's
happening right now.

09:28.727 --> 09:29.628
Yeah, but that's not even true

09:29.661 --> 09:31.196
'cause you're here right now.

09:33.832 --> 09:36.902
I, uh, I can respect that
you're doing your thing,

09:36.936 --> 09:40.372
just take note that
I asked I guess.

09:42.407 --> 09:43.442
Noted.

09:45.945 --> 09:47.212
After you.

09:53.185 --> 09:54.887
That didn't happen!

10:19.378 --> 10:21.480
<i>It feels
wrong to make this about us.</i>

10:22.581 --> 10:23.950
<i>It's bigger than that.</i>

10:25.617 --> 10:26.418
So much bigger.

10:28.921 --> 10:30.389
We'd hear stories
from somewhere like

10:30.422 --> 10:32.558
the coast of
Maryland or Florida.

10:33.993 --> 10:36.628
Always there, not here.

10:38.163 --> 10:39.933
Like the story of the
man stranded in the ocean

10:39.966 --> 10:41.935
picked up by a fishing boat.

10:41.968 --> 10:44.202
It turned out he was
another fisherman,

10:44.236 --> 10:46.438
his boat washed up to
shore four days later.

10:47.406 --> 10:49.274
He said he couldn't
remember how to steer it

10:49.308 --> 10:50.909
so he decided to swim home.

10:54.613 --> 10:57.416
Or the woman in the marathon
who forgot to stop running.

11:04.456 --> 11:07.259
There's something quite beautiful
to these stories at first.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.964
But then a pilot
forgot how to fly.

11:15.969 --> 11:18.604
They call it NIA.

11:18.637 --> 11:20.138
Neuroinflammatory Affliction.

11:22.174 --> 11:24.776
It can affect anyone,
and there's no cure.

11:28.380 --> 11:30.616
Ben was the first person
we knew to get sick.

11:31.817 --> 11:33.785
We say get sick, but
that's not really it.

11:35.220 --> 11:39.625
Some people snap all at
once, other people fade away.

11:42.794 --> 11:45.430
I'm not really sure
which one is worse.

11:55.074 --> 11:55.841
Sup?

11:57.309 --> 11:59.045
Nothing apparently.

11:59.078 --> 12:00.145
Fell asleep.

12:32.244 --> 12:33.378
Jude?

12:33.412 --> 12:34.846
- Yeah?
- Hey, I'm going now.

12:35.681 --> 12:37.315
All right.

12:37.349 --> 12:38.517
You good?

12:38.550 --> 12:40.053
Yeah, just waking up.

12:40.086 --> 12:41.353
All right, well,
I'll see you later.

12:41.386 --> 12:42.554
- All right, babe.
- Bye, darling.

12:42.587 --> 12:43.755
Bye, bye, bye.

12:56.035 --> 12:57.602
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:57.636 --> 12:59.705
How many have we got
today? We're already packed.

12:59.738 --> 13:00.439
Just two.

13:01.640 --> 13:02.607
Come on, bud.

13:02.641 --> 13:04.177
All right, come here.

13:04.209 --> 13:05.911
I got ya, all right.

13:07.612 --> 13:08.647
Hello, you.

13:10.649 --> 13:13.418
All right, let's see if
we can find your family.

13:13.452 --> 13:14.720
Oh, yeah.

13:14.753 --> 13:15.520
Come here.

13:16.922 --> 13:18.024
- Oh, hey, I can get that.
- Oh, that's all right.

13:18.057 --> 13:19.125
- Yeah, all good.
- Oh okay.

13:19.158 --> 13:20.258
All set.

13:20.292 --> 13:21.593
- Thanks, Frank.
- Sure.

13:22.661 --> 13:23.829
Sorry, your name again?

13:26.132 --> 13:26.898
Emma.

13:26.933 --> 13:28.533
Emma, right!

13:28.567 --> 13:30.136
Right, right.

13:30.169 --> 13:33.106
Well, it's not to
uh... yeah, yeah.

14:05.138 --> 14:05.938
Jude?

14:10.275 --> 14:11.010
I thought that was you.

14:11.043 --> 14:12.744
Naps.

14:12.778 --> 14:13.845
How's it going, man? You good?

14:13.879 --> 14:15.114
Good, and you?

14:15.148 --> 14:16.015
Yeah, good
to see you man.

14:16.048 --> 14:16.782
Yeah, it's been awhile.

14:16.815 --> 14:17.682
What brings you here?

14:17.716 --> 14:18.617
I'm playing here tonight.

14:18.650 --> 14:19.986
- Here?
- Yeah.

14:20.019 --> 14:20.987
- No shit.
- Yeah.

14:22.654 --> 14:25.524
- You're still at it.
- That's right.

14:25.557 --> 14:26.625
Awesome, that's awesome.

14:26.658 --> 14:28.027
- You should come.
- Tonight?

14:28.060 --> 14:28.860
Yeah.

14:30.529 --> 14:32.430
Well, I gotta
check with my wife.

14:32.464 --> 14:34.299
- Wife?
- Yeah, I got married.

14:34.332 --> 14:35.767
Get the fuck outta here.

14:35.801 --> 14:36.668
Holy shit, man.

14:36.701 --> 14:38.670
- Man, we gotta catch up.
- Yeah.

14:38.703 --> 14:39.671
You got a minute?

14:39.704 --> 14:41.274
Yeah, I got a minute.

14:41.306 --> 14:42.340
- You need a hand or what?
- Yeah, of course, come on.

14:42.374 --> 14:43.109
- All right.
- Are you still rolling

14:43.142 --> 14:44.010
with the same crew?

14:44.043 --> 14:44.944
Yeah, I still see 'em.

14:44.977 --> 14:46.112
Yeah, yeah, yeah, what happened?

14:46.145 --> 14:47.013
Playing solo or what?

14:47.046 --> 14:48.047
Hey, man. Stop it.

14:48.080 --> 14:49.714
- What happened?
- Nothing.

16:28.580 --> 16:30.548
Coming by, sorry, sorry.

16:34.819 --> 16:36.222
- Mr. Johnson.
- Where the hell

16:36.255 --> 16:37.822
- have you been?
- Yeah, I'm so sorry, sir.

16:37.856 --> 16:39.557
You were supposed to
be here an hour ago.

16:39.591 --> 16:40.927
Yeah, I, there's
no excuse, sir.

16:40.960 --> 16:42.560
We wanted pictures of
the girls getting ready.

16:42.594 --> 16:44.763
We paid for pictures of
the girls getting ready.

16:44.796 --> 16:45.897
Yeah, I understand, I-

16:45.932 --> 16:47.934
- No, no, I don't think
you do understand.

16:47.967 --> 16:49.901
Those moments are gone,
we don't get those back.

16:49.936 --> 16:52.470
We had to get my nephew
here to take pictures.

16:52.504 --> 16:53.438
Yeah, sorry, sir.

16:54.606 --> 16:55.807
I'll get a full
deposit back to you.

16:55.840 --> 16:56.775
Hey, hey.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.411
Just take some fucking pictures.

16:58.443 --> 16:59.844
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.

17:06.953 --> 17:08.354
<i>Hi, love.</i>

17:08.387 --> 17:09.521
Hi, Mom.

17:09.554 --> 17:10.423
<i>How is it, then?</i>

17:10.455 --> 17:11.823
Yeah, fine.

17:11.856 --> 17:12.757
How was Germany?

17:12.791 --> 17:14.293
<i>Oh, didn't I tell you?</i>

17:14.327 --> 17:15.928
<i>That trip got postponed.</i>

17:15.962 --> 17:17.430
<i>I'm still at home, but I'll
be going there in a few weeks.</i>

17:17.462 --> 17:19.831
Mom, you have to
tell me these things,

17:19.864 --> 17:21.499
I'm coming to see
you in a month.

17:21.533 --> 17:22.435
- <i>Hun-</i>
- Will you be back by then?

17:22.467 --> 17:23.802
<i>I thought I did tell ya.</i>

17:24.971 --> 17:25.972
<i>Didn't I?</i>

17:26.005 --> 17:28.307
<i>But don't worry, I'll be back.</i>

17:28.341 --> 17:29.507
<i>How are ya?</i>

17:29.541 --> 17:30.875
I'm okay.

17:30.909 --> 17:33.812
Work's getting stressful,
but I'm looking forward

17:33.845 --> 17:35.047
to coming and seeing ya.

17:35.081 --> 17:36.382
I wish they hadn't
grounded all those flights

17:36.415 --> 17:39.051
so I could come sooner,
but it's all right.

17:39.085 --> 17:42.288
<i>Oh, remind me.
Is David coming with ya?</i>

17:42.321 --> 17:43.255
- Jude?
- <i>What?</i>

17:44.656 --> 17:45.958
Jude.

17:45.992 --> 17:47.326
<i>Oh, God, what did I say?</i>

17:47.360 --> 17:49.128
<i>Chris, Henry, David, Jude.</i>

17:49.161 --> 17:51.330
<i>You know I was never
good with names anyhow.</i>

17:52.999 --> 17:54.532
Yeah.

17:54.566 --> 17:58.037
Yeah, no, but it's not the first
time you've forgotten, Mom.

17:59.271 --> 18:01.240
I know I told ya I could
only get the one ticket.

18:01.273 --> 18:02.841
<i>Of course, that's right.</i>

18:02.874 --> 18:04.909
<i>Well, hug Jude for me, will ya?</i>

18:04.944 --> 18:06.012
Yeah.

18:09.914 --> 18:11.516
Mom.

18:11.549 --> 18:12.617
<i>What?</i>

18:13.918 --> 18:14.886
Are you feeling okay?

18:14.919 --> 18:16.688
<i>Yes, love. I'm great.</i>

18:17.889 --> 18:19.392
<i>You let me do the
worrying over here.</i>

18:27.866 --> 18:28.833
You all right?

18:28.867 --> 18:29.901
Yeah, you?

18:33.905 --> 18:35.941
I'm not even a vet anymore,
I'm just an executioner.

18:35.975 --> 18:36.775
I hate it.

18:38.110 --> 18:39.445
I had to put down the
most beautiful pup today,

18:39.478 --> 18:41.013
she had the most
expressive eyes.

18:41.047 --> 18:42.415
They were like human eyes.

18:44.483 --> 18:46.952
I was gonna call you and see
if I could take her home.

18:48.054 --> 18:48.820
Let's...

18:49.989 --> 18:50.855
Please let's not
get into that again.

18:50.889 --> 18:51.856
It's just one dog.

18:51.890 --> 18:53.792
No, but it's not just one.

18:53.825 --> 18:55.928
If we take one we'll
probably take 17

18:55.961 --> 18:58.431
and we already got Blue,
we don't have room.

18:59.631 --> 19:01.633
You know that we can't.

19:16.415 --> 19:17.916
What's happening?

19:21.253 --> 19:22.488
Why are you stopping?

19:25.657 --> 19:27.960
Yeah, I don't think this
bus is going anywhere.

19:31.997 --> 19:34.967
What is
happening right now?

19:36.469 --> 19:38.104
Attention.

19:38.137 --> 19:42.341
If you are lost or need
assistance, call 707

19:42.374 --> 19:44.809
and have your ID ready.

19:44.843 --> 19:47.980
If someone you know
is lost or missing,

19:48.013 --> 19:51.683
check the missing person
database or call 811

20:21.046 --> 20:23.048
Do you think anybody's immune?

20:23.082 --> 20:24.016
Oh yeah.

20:24.049 --> 20:25.551
Me, for instance.

20:25.584 --> 20:28.720
All right, so it doesn't
affect the geniuses amongst us.

20:28.753 --> 20:31.789
What if the
only person who's immune

20:31.823 --> 20:33.025
already has Alzheimers?

20:33.058 --> 20:33.825
Ooh.

20:33.858 --> 20:34.659
So you'd never know.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.529
Ooh, yeah.

20:36.562 --> 20:38.998
That is so fucked up
that's probably how it is.

20:39.031 --> 20:40.665
Or what if this is
just the next phase

20:40.698 --> 20:43.202
of human evolution and we
should just embrace it?

20:43.235 --> 20:45.004
We fucked everything up
so badly that the only way

20:45.037 --> 20:47.872
to survive this is
just by forgetting.

20:47.906 --> 20:50.708
Mm hmm, yeah,
I like that, too.

20:52.578 --> 20:53.878
What about dogs?

20:53.912 --> 20:55.314
Do you think dogs
are susceptible?

20:55.347 --> 20:56.582
Unclear.

20:56.615 --> 20:58.250
They rely more on
associative memories,

20:58.284 --> 21:00.718
so just don't change
the way you smell

21:00.752 --> 21:02.087
and keep feeding him
and you'll be fine.

21:02.121 --> 21:04.889
Hey, don't you fucking
forget about me, Blue!

21:06.559 --> 21:08.160
Oh, I'm sorry, bud.

21:08.194 --> 21:10.695
I didn't think you'd
take that so seriously.

21:10.728 --> 21:11.863
Yeah, I love you, too.

21:12.764 --> 21:14.099
Yeah, sorry, buddy.

21:17.369 --> 21:19.538
It's a shame we can't
take some of them.

21:19.572 --> 21:22.208
The dogs.

21:22.241 --> 21:24.410
They've been putting
down so many recently.

21:28.380 --> 21:29.747
What?

21:29.781 --> 21:31.749
Yeah, just like a
puppy or something.

21:32.651 --> 21:34.153
I'm sure Blue wouldn't mind.

21:36.255 --> 21:37.056
What?

21:38.624 --> 21:40.092
You said we couldn't.

21:41.293 --> 21:43.095
When?

21:43.128 --> 21:45.564
We had an argument about
this last week and then

21:45.598 --> 21:48.167
we were just about to get
into it again on the bus.

21:55.975 --> 21:56.942
Very good.

21:56.976 --> 21:58.310
- Jude, I'm-
- Almost.

21:58.344 --> 22:00.279
This is an ongoing argument
that we've been having,

22:00.312 --> 22:03.249
we were just about to get
into it half an hour ago.

22:03.282 --> 22:04.283
It was just now.

22:06.118 --> 22:08.087
I don't remember that.

22:08.120 --> 22:09.622
Oh my God.

22:14.693 --> 22:16.161
Did you know this was happening?

22:16.195 --> 22:18.664
No, how am I
gonna know I forgot?

22:18.697 --> 22:19.965
Do you know who I am?

22:19.999 --> 22:21.267
Yeah, you're my
wife, Emma Veta.

22:21.300 --> 22:22.735
Where did we meet?
What's your father's name?

22:22.767 --> 22:24.169
- Where did you grow up?
- Emma!

22:32.111 --> 22:34.713
This is gonna be
like Ben, isn't it?

22:46.625 --> 22:47.792
When your disaster

22:47.825 --> 22:51.130
is everyone's disaster,
how do you grieve?

22:57.303 --> 22:59.638
When Ben first started
losing his memory

22:59.672 --> 23:02.474
he wanted us to record
every song he'd ever written

23:02.508 --> 23:03.875
before they were all gone.

23:24.563 --> 23:26.498
Wanna do it again?

23:26.532 --> 23:29.168
One, two, three, four.

23:40.346 --> 23:41.547
You got this.

23:41.580 --> 23:44.083
Just relax, you got this.

23:44.116 --> 23:46.185
It's not happening.

23:46.218 --> 23:48.020
It's not happening,
it's just not happening.

23:48.053 --> 23:49.355
You got it.

23:49.388 --> 23:53.325
If you want, we can just
record the guitar first

23:53.359 --> 23:56.695
and the vocals and then
I can open up the bass.

23:56.729 --> 23:58.931
Yeah, sounds good.

23:58.964 --> 23:59.732
Okay.

24:09.775 --> 24:11.043
He tried
so hard not to see him scared.

24:12.244 --> 24:13.345
I guess we all did.

24:13.379 --> 24:14.580
I got an idea.

25:30.222 --> 25:33.025
I can't
tell if I'm torturing myself,

25:33.058 --> 25:35.194
pretending like I'm
gonna find the answer.

25:37.329 --> 25:39.331
I keep going back
to the beginning.

26:17.269 --> 26:18.403
<i>This is Jody Ryerson.</i>

26:18.437 --> 26:20.506
<i>Leave a message after the tone.</i>

26:20.539 --> 26:22.908
<i>The mailbox is
full and cannot accept</i>

26:22.942 --> 26:24.643
<i>any new messages at this time.</i>

26:24.676 --> 26:25.444
<i>Goodbye.</i>

26:39.091 --> 26:41.560
If you are
experiencing NIA symptoms

26:41.593 --> 26:45.932
I need you over here.

26:45.965 --> 26:47.432
Don't worry
about the car.

26:48.634 --> 26:50.669
If you are here on
behalf of someone else,

26:50.702 --> 26:53.872
please make a line to my right.

26:53.906 --> 26:55.507
Listen carefully!

26:55.541 --> 27:00.479
If you are experiencing NIA
symptoms, I need you over here.

27:01.613 --> 27:04.017
If you are here on
behalf of someone else,

27:04.049 --> 27:06.218
please make a line to my right.

27:06.251 --> 27:09.421
If you were here yesterday
and did not get in,

27:09.454 --> 27:11.557
please have your
ticket stubs ready.

27:11.590 --> 27:12.925
I dropped mine!

27:14.726 --> 27:15.894
Excuse me!

27:15.929 --> 27:18.031
On behalf of someone
else, over here.

27:18.063 --> 27:20.465
Sign the consent form,
have your money ready.

27:20.499 --> 27:21.767
- All sign the consent form.
- Gloria, over here!

27:21.800 --> 27:23.268
Okay,
okay, okay, people.

27:24.469 --> 27:25.939
Have your ticket stubs ready.

27:25.972 --> 27:29.575
I'm sorry, we
can't accept anyone under 25.

27:29.608 --> 27:30.876
What do you mean?

27:30.909 --> 27:32.644
The brain
isn't fully developed.

27:32.678 --> 27:35.714
If you are experiencing
NIA symptoms, over here.

27:38.417 --> 27:39.585
- Nurse!
- Are you kidding

27:39.618 --> 27:40.419
me right now?

27:40.452 --> 27:42.220
- Can I help you?
- Yes!

27:42.254 --> 27:43.022
Excuse me.

27:44.590 --> 27:46.425
What is this? Have
you found a cure or?

27:46.458 --> 27:48.460
This is for the chance
to be in a clinical trial,

27:48.493 --> 27:49.761
it's a lottery.

27:49.795 --> 27:51.096
Okay, but does it work?

27:51.129 --> 27:53.231
I mean, if you get into
the trial, does it work?

27:53.265 --> 27:55.267
All I know is
that it's a trial.

27:55.300 --> 27:56.802
Fill this out, turn it out
when you get to the door

27:56.835 --> 27:58.604
and have your money ready, okay?

28:01.840 --> 28:03.508
We have to
wait in line anyway,

28:03.542 --> 28:05.143
you can't jump ahead.

28:05.177 --> 28:06.278
And I wanna go in.

28:06.311 --> 28:07.913
I don't care about anybody else.

28:07.947 --> 28:09.848
I'm talking about me.

28:09.881 --> 28:11.149
I don't know.

28:11.183 --> 28:13.685
I don't know, but my
dad, he's lost his ID.

28:13.719 --> 28:14.720
Fine, fine!

28:15.554 --> 28:18.423
Guy pushed in front!

28:18.457 --> 28:22.327
Which line is
it? This one or that one?

28:24.796 --> 28:26.598
Over here.

28:36.508 --> 28:39.277
Roses felt too easy, but
I didn't know what you liked

28:39.311 --> 28:40.646
so I got you daisies.

28:40.679 --> 28:42.447
Aren't daisies weeds?

28:42.481 --> 28:43.482
Huh?

28:43.515 --> 28:44.650
Aren't daisies weeds?

28:44.683 --> 28:46.551
Oh, well good to
see you and goodnight.

28:46.585 --> 28:47.519
I'm kidding!

28:47.552 --> 28:48.587
Come here.

28:52.091 --> 28:53.358
Yeah, I think I'm gonna
do a couple more years

28:53.392 --> 28:54.826
as a vet tech to
save up some money

28:54.860 --> 28:56.728
to go back to
school to study bio,

28:56.762 --> 29:00.133
eventually be in the labs
and maybe publish one day.

29:00.165 --> 29:00.899
We'll see.

29:01.733 --> 29:02.501
What about you?

29:04.403 --> 29:05.170
What about me?

29:05.203 --> 29:06.705
What are you doing?

29:06.738 --> 29:10.776
Oh, well, I've been around a
lot with Ben and Sam touring,

29:12.377 --> 29:14.013
- taking pictures.
- Yeah.

29:14.047 --> 29:16.481
For different bands,
different magazines.

29:16.515 --> 29:17.683
Oh, cool.

29:17.716 --> 29:18.483
Yeah.

29:18.517 --> 29:19.918
I helped them record.

29:19.952 --> 29:22.521
It was a cool way to spend
the first half of my 20s, but

29:23.855 --> 29:27.459
things got a little outta
hand with drinking, drugs.

29:30.228 --> 29:33.398
Uh, Sam's parents were out
here so we came here to dry out

29:34.533 --> 29:36.301
and kinda never really left.

29:37.536 --> 29:38.770
Is that why you
don't drink anymore?

29:38.804 --> 29:40.272
Yeah.

29:40.305 --> 29:43.775
What was it that
happened to make you stop?

29:45.577 --> 29:49.748
That's a pretty intense
second date question.

29:50.749 --> 29:51.550
Sorry.

29:52.584 --> 29:53.953
I'm just being nosy.

29:53.986 --> 29:55.387
Just tell me to shut up.

29:55.420 --> 29:57.123
So, actually, do you
want me to leave?

29:57.156 --> 29:58.423
I'll go.

29:58.457 --> 29:59.758
No, it's all right,
I'll go. You stay here.

30:01.827 --> 30:03.862
Anyway, you, it's
not our second date.

30:03.895 --> 30:04.763
It's not?

30:04.796 --> 30:06.565
No, first one was Halloween.

30:06.598 --> 30:08.366
Well, I definitely
don't count that.

30:08.400 --> 30:09.601
Because you can't count.

30:09.634 --> 30:11.236
No, because you
said it didn't happen.

30:11.269 --> 30:12.071
What didn't happen?

30:12.105 --> 30:12.904
This.

30:17.143 --> 30:18.577
Sorry.

30:18.610 --> 30:19.878
- No!
- Sorry, sorry.

30:19.911 --> 30:22.547
No, I thought it was
a smooth, cool moment,

30:22.581 --> 30:25.383
- but if you're not uh-
- No, no, don't be silly.

30:25.417 --> 30:27.419
Uh, I just...

30:27.452 --> 30:29.654
I'm just not very good at this.

30:29.688 --> 30:30.756
What?

30:32.324 --> 30:33.792
Do you wanna have sex?

30:36.294 --> 30:37.295
Don't laugh!

30:38.797 --> 30:40.665
I really need your
fucking consent.

30:40.699 --> 30:42.300
Oh my God, uh...

30:43.502 --> 30:44.269
Yes.

30:45.804 --> 30:48.607
But I know you're going
through some shit with Tom,

30:48.640 --> 30:49.841
- I don't wanna-
- Tim.

30:49.875 --> 30:50.642
Tim.

30:52.145 --> 30:54.813
Yeah, and he's just a friend.

30:56.648 --> 30:58.383
Yeah,
does he know that?

31:02.854 --> 31:04.823
Not in those exact words.

31:07.692 --> 31:09.128
Well, I get that.

31:09.162 --> 31:11.463
So, let's just wait.

31:14.733 --> 31:15.901
I'm not going anywhere.

32:36.748 --> 32:37.883
Hello?

32:37.916 --> 32:39.384
<i>Jude Williams, please.</i>

32:39.417 --> 32:41.419
This is his wife,
who's speaking?

32:41.453 --> 32:44.756
<i>I'm Dr. Dormer with
DPC Research Development.</i>

32:45.958 --> 32:46.959
<i>The NIA trial.</i>

32:48.961 --> 32:50.029
<i>Hello?</i>

32:50.062 --> 32:51.529
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

32:51.563 --> 32:54.033
<i>Can I speak
with your husband?</i>

32:54.066 --> 32:58.436
Um, it's probably best
that you just speak to me

32:58.470 --> 33:01.473
'cause I'm the one that
submitted the application.

33:01.506 --> 33:03.742
<i>Jude has been
selected for the clinical trial</i>

33:03.775 --> 33:05.877
<i>on an NIA suppressant.</i>

33:05.911 --> 33:07.612
<i>I see from the forms
that were submitted</i>

33:07.646 --> 33:09.915
<i>that he's exhibiting
NIA symptoms, correct?</i>

33:11.850 --> 33:12.617
<i>Hello?</i>

33:12.651 --> 33:13.885
Yeah, sorry.

33:13.919 --> 33:14.954
Yeah, I'm here.

33:17.822 --> 33:19.557
So, he's gotten in?

33:19.591 --> 33:21.826
<i>He's been
accepted for an evaluation.</i>

33:21.860 --> 33:23.963
<i>If he passes he'll be
invited to participate</i>

33:23.996 --> 33:25.897
<i>in the actual trials.</i>

33:25.932 --> 33:28.267
<i>We're trying to
move quickly here.</i>

33:28.301 --> 33:30.769
<i>Can we schedule an appointment
for him to come in tomorrow?</i>

33:33.471 --> 33:36.342
The government has the
cure, they have the true cure,

33:36.375 --> 33:39.145
not the one they're giving
us that doesn't work.

33:39.178 --> 33:41.147
They've been keeping
NIA on the streets

33:41.180 --> 33:43.983
just like that fuck
Reagan did with AIDS.

33:44.016 --> 33:45.917
And who's doing
something about it?

33:45.952 --> 33:48.087
Are you? I am because I care.

33:48.120 --> 33:50.957
I don't want this sickness,
this population control.

33:50.990 --> 33:52.924
They're keeping us down.

33:52.959 --> 33:54.492
They have the true cure.

34:20.219 --> 34:23.322
Wear one of these
and when you're done

34:23.356 --> 34:26.025
filling this paperwork out
somebody will call your name.

34:27.559 --> 34:29.627
Keep your mask on and
fill this paperwork out.

34:50.682 --> 34:51.450
Emma?

34:52.351 --> 34:53.219
Hey.

34:53.252 --> 34:54.053
Oh my God, Sam.

34:55.254 --> 34:56.322
Good to see you, hey.

34:56.355 --> 35:00.326
Oh, it's good to see you.

35:00.359 --> 35:01.193
It's been a minute.

35:01.227 --> 35:02.727
Yeah, I know. Yeah.

35:02.761 --> 35:04.263
I'm just here for the day, just

35:04.296 --> 35:06.232
- running errands.
- Yeah.

35:06.265 --> 35:07.400
Right.

35:07.433 --> 35:08.434
Right, yeah.

35:09.368 --> 35:10.769
Oh, it's good to see ya.

35:10.802 --> 35:12.104
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?

35:12.138 --> 35:13.372
I'm good, yeah, I'm good.

35:13.406 --> 35:15.107
- Yeah?
- Yeah, really, I'm just...

35:16.442 --> 35:17.443
How are you?

35:17.476 --> 35:19.677
Yeah, no, yes, I am just...

35:19.711 --> 35:22.481
Just making phone calls
and all that stuff.

35:24.816 --> 35:26.718
Sorry I haven't called.

35:27.919 --> 35:28.954
Yeah.

35:28.988 --> 35:30.956
Yeah, same. I'm...

35:30.990 --> 35:32.058
I wanted to.

35:34.326 --> 35:35.327
Oh, darling.

35:36.962 --> 35:38.931
You must think I'm the
biggest asshole on the planet.

35:38.964 --> 35:39.864
No, I don't.

35:39.898 --> 35:40.765
No, I don't, that's ridiculous.

35:40.799 --> 35:42.234
I do not think that at all.

35:43.835 --> 35:44.803
Sorry, I'm just.

35:44.836 --> 35:46.439
- Yeah, sorry.
- It's okay.

35:46.472 --> 35:48.974
Um, tell Jude I say hi, okay?

35:49.008 --> 35:50.109
Yeah, I will.

35:50.142 --> 35:51.110
It's good to
see you, I just...

35:51.143 --> 35:52.744
Good to see you.

35:52.777 --> 35:53.979
I just wasn't expecting
to see you, that's all.

35:54.013 --> 35:54.947
Yeah.

35:54.980 --> 35:56.449
Yeah, no worries.

35:56.482 --> 35:57.950
- I'll give you a bell.
- Okay.

35:57.983 --> 35:59.018
- Okay.
- Bye.

36:08.626 --> 36:10.628
Any history
of heart disease?

36:10.662 --> 36:11.564
Nope.

36:11.596 --> 36:12.831
High cholesterol?

36:12.864 --> 36:14.066
Nope.

36:14.100 --> 36:15.067
Diabetes?

36:15.101 --> 36:16.668
Nope.

36:16.701 --> 36:17.937
Do you take drugs?

36:20.139 --> 36:21.006
What does
that got to do with-

36:21.040 --> 36:22.740
- We'll find out either way,

36:22.774 --> 36:24.009
- so better to get it out now.
- Oh, it's not gonna

36:24.043 --> 36:24.977
be a problem, I've been clean

36:25.010 --> 36:27.947
for five years and nine months.

36:29.381 --> 36:30.915
So, how long
would you say you've been

36:30.950 --> 36:32.485
experiencing symptoms of NIA?

36:34.186 --> 36:35.753
Like a month.

36:35.787 --> 36:39.592
I can remember some things,
but other things are just gone.

36:39.624 --> 36:42.161
Like details, I
can't do details.

36:43.362 --> 36:47.032
Like I can remember
people, who they are,

36:47.066 --> 36:49.301
but I can't zero in.

36:49.335 --> 36:52.037
Your brain may be
trying to bridge the gaps,

36:52.071 --> 36:53.539
taking other moments
you still remember

36:53.572 --> 36:55.241
and merging with false memories.

36:59.211 --> 37:00.513
So, the treatment.

37:00.546 --> 37:03.815
Is it like what?
It's like a pill or?

37:03.848 --> 37:06.051
We'll be
doing an oral CP.

37:06.085 --> 37:07.652
Sorry, what?

37:07.685 --> 37:09.355
An oral cranial puncture.

37:09.388 --> 37:11.991
Think of it as clearing
a clogged pathway.

37:12.024 --> 37:15.361
The brain is separated
into four major lobes.

37:15.394 --> 37:19.365
The one most closely associated
with memory being temporal.

37:19.398 --> 37:22.401
Now, we remove the lateral
through he roof of the mouth.

37:23.835 --> 37:26.138
Inter-cranial hypertensions.

37:41.187 --> 37:42.188
- Jude?
- Yeah?

37:43.189 --> 37:44.756
Are you okay?

37:44.789 --> 37:45.591
Yeah.

37:47.560 --> 37:49.328
But what are the risks?

37:49.361 --> 37:51.763
We have some literature
we can send home with you

37:51.796 --> 37:53.165
that really walks
you through the ins

37:53.199 --> 37:54.567
and outs of the procedure.

37:54.600 --> 37:57.869
It's not complicated, but
there are significant risks.

37:57.902 --> 37:59.672
We have a counselor on
hand to help make sure

37:59.704 --> 38:01.540
you understand what
we're dealing with.

38:22.794 --> 38:24.630
To identify
a neuroinflammation begin

38:24.663 --> 38:26.298
by asking baseline questions.

38:29.468 --> 38:33.205
What's your name?
How old are ya?

38:33.239 --> 38:34.440
What's your favorite color?

38:38.143 --> 38:41.046
This is all they've
given ya? Brain teasers?

38:41.080 --> 38:43.549
I thought there was supposed
to be some sort of procedure.

38:43.582 --> 38:47.253
Yeah, it's brain
teasers and...

38:50.855 --> 38:51.657
And?

38:53.025 --> 38:53.925
Surgery.

38:56.761 --> 38:59.531
They take like a
metal straw and...

39:04.103 --> 39:05.104
I don't wanna do it, Em.

39:06.838 --> 39:08.107
What'd the doctor say?

39:08.140 --> 39:09.275
They don't even know
if it's gonna work,

39:09.308 --> 39:10.842
it's like a trial.

39:12.011 --> 39:13.911
Let's see and find
out, let's poke around

39:13.946 --> 39:16.749
in some dude's skull and
hope we don't cripple him

39:16.781 --> 39:18.317
and make him go blind.

39:19.151 --> 39:20.619
I'm not doing it, man.

39:20.653 --> 39:24.590
I could just wind up with no
memory, no legs, and no eyes.

39:24.623 --> 39:27.259
And if I'm gonna forget who I am

39:27.293 --> 39:29.962
then I'd at least like to be
able to see where I'm going.

39:31.664 --> 39:33.132
So you made
up your mind then.

39:33.165 --> 39:34.199
Yeah.

39:36.868 --> 39:37.936
Do I not get a say in this?

39:37.970 --> 39:39.171
Emma, you can't ask me

39:39.204 --> 39:40.472
- to sit there while-
- But Jude, I am asking ya,

39:40.506 --> 39:42.041
I am asking ya,
I have to ask ya.

39:42.074 --> 39:44.310
I get it, you don't wanna go
blind or end up in a wheelchair

39:44.343 --> 39:45.477
but if there's a chance
that we can stop it

39:45.511 --> 39:47.212
then I don't understand
why you won't try.

39:47.246 --> 39:49.214
- I know you're upset-
- I'm not fucking upset, Jude!

39:49.248 --> 39:51.684
Well, you don't sound
very not fucking upset!

40:00.392 --> 40:01.893
My mom's starting to fade.

40:06.265 --> 40:07.499
Why didn't you tell me?

40:07.533 --> 40:09.867
Because I can't do
anything about it, Jude.

40:09.901 --> 40:11.337
I've got a ticket
that I can't change

40:11.370 --> 40:14.006
for weeks from now and now
I've got this, I've got you.

40:14.039 --> 40:15.507
So what am I supposed to do?

40:15.541 --> 40:16.342
Just go off to England while
my husband forgets about me?

40:16.375 --> 40:18.010
I'm not fucking doing that.

40:18.043 --> 40:19.244
I'm not losing my mom and my
husband in the same breath,

40:19.278 --> 40:20.746
so I need you to
explain it to me.

40:20.779 --> 40:23.315
Can you explain it to me
why you won't do this?

40:23.349 --> 40:24.350
What? Because you don't care?

40:24.383 --> 40:26.685
No, of course I
fucking care, Emma.

40:28.187 --> 40:29.555
This is happening to me.

40:31.023 --> 40:33.192
This is fucking
scary for me, too.

40:33.225 --> 40:34.026
I'm scared.

40:38.364 --> 40:39.298
I'm fucking scared.

41:05.257 --> 41:07.393
Who am I? How old am I?

41:08.827 --> 41:10.162
What's my favorite color?

41:15.434 --> 41:16.268
Jude, please.

41:18.237 --> 41:19.271
I'm scared, too.

41:27.146 --> 41:31.417
You're my wife, Emma
Vita Ryerson Williams.

41:31.450 --> 41:32.251
You're 28.

41:35.354 --> 41:40.192
Your favorite color is yellow.

41:42.428 --> 41:44.329
Describe a memory
that took place

41:44.363 --> 41:45.831
in the room that you're in.

41:49.435 --> 41:50.636
- You fucking-
- Whoa, easy, take it easy.

41:50.669 --> 41:53.405
Take it easy, easy.

41:53.439 --> 41:55.240
You fucking!

41:55.274 --> 41:57.509
Well, you didn't
like the gray walls in there,

41:57.543 --> 42:00.179
you said they reminded you
of rainy days back home.

42:03.482 --> 42:05.617
So you painted 'em yellow.

42:09.321 --> 42:10.456
- Come on.
- No!

42:13.358 --> 42:15.694
What time
of year was it?

42:15.727 --> 42:16.528
Summer.

42:20.899 --> 42:23.469
No, winter.

42:35.881 --> 42:37.249
We had just bought a fish.

42:38.550 --> 42:40.552
What fish?

42:40.586 --> 42:42.221
You called him Ampersand.

42:42.254 --> 42:44.389
Emma and Jude.

42:44.423 --> 42:46.291
Emma and Jude.

42:46.325 --> 42:49.528
Do you remember why
we bought the fish?

43:40.145 --> 43:41.647
Look at this little guy.

43:46.818 --> 43:50.023
He doesn't have a clue
what's going on in the world.

43:50.055 --> 43:54.459
No NIA, no cancer, no crusades.

43:54.493 --> 43:56.528
Just gets to swim around
having a good time.

43:56.562 --> 43:57.796
We should be so lucky.

43:59.398 --> 44:01.733
That's what I feel
like when I'm with you.

44:01.767 --> 44:03.135
Like a fish?

44:03.168 --> 44:04.436
No, you know what I meant.

44:05.972 --> 44:08.440
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

44:11.443 --> 44:12.578
Let's get married.

44:16.281 --> 44:17.082
Okay.

44:18.116 --> 44:19.885
No, I'm not joking.

44:19.918 --> 44:21.119
Me neither.

44:21.153 --> 44:22.387
I wanna spend the rest
of my life with you.

44:22.421 --> 44:23.455
I wanna fucking marry you.

44:23.488 --> 44:24.656
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

44:40.940 --> 44:41.707
Shit.

44:42.641 --> 44:43.909
Change your mind already?

44:43.943 --> 44:46.144
No, I don't have a ring.

44:49.348 --> 44:51.316
Then buy me a fish.

44:51.350 --> 44:52.150
Yeah?

45:09.701 --> 45:12.537
Do you know that this
is a type of memory

45:13.839 --> 45:16.042
exclusively tied to the touch?

45:17.476 --> 45:18.877
Haptic memory.

45:21.580 --> 45:22.648
Haptic?

45:26.818 --> 45:29.521
Did you read that in your book?

45:41.400 --> 45:44.070
I haven't forgotten
how you feel.

46:02.721 --> 46:04.556
Will you touch me?

47:07.786 --> 47:09.588
They say
you can't forget feelings

47:11.490 --> 47:12.824
and I still believe that.

47:15.360 --> 47:16.162
Even after Ben.

47:21.934 --> 47:23.069
Sam?

47:23.102 --> 47:25.071
What, what, what, what, what?

47:25.104 --> 47:26.505
Are you all right?

47:26.538 --> 47:27.639
Darling, what's
happening? What's happening?

47:27.672 --> 47:30.642
He's just freaking
out, Emma, I can't.

47:30.675 --> 47:31.476
It'll be okay, it'll be okay.

47:31.510 --> 47:32.677
What the fuck!

47:33.812 --> 47:35.313
Get out!

47:35.347 --> 47:36.149
Ben?

47:37.649 --> 47:39.317
Ben?

47:39.351 --> 47:40.119
- Ben?
- Jude?

47:40.153 --> 47:41.120
Yeah.

47:41.954 --> 47:43.156
You all right?

47:45.057 --> 47:46.591
Jude.

47:46.625 --> 47:47.692
Can I come in?

47:49.795 --> 47:50.595
I don't know.

47:50.629 --> 47:52.131
I'm coming in, all right?

47:56.701 --> 47:57.736
What's going on?

47:59.838 --> 48:00.539
Jude!

48:00.572 --> 48:01.807
Yeah?

48:01.840 --> 48:02.707
Yeah, we're good.

48:02.741 --> 48:04.210
We're good, right? We're good.

48:04.243 --> 48:05.377
Yeah, we're okay.

48:05.410 --> 48:06.611
He's... Emma.

48:06.645 --> 48:07.779
Are you all right?
Did he hurt you?

48:07.813 --> 48:09.015
He just grabbed a knife

48:09.048 --> 48:10.549
and he doesn't even
remember my name right now.

48:10.582 --> 48:11.850
- Calm down.
- I thought I was in my house,

48:11.883 --> 48:14.352
man, and then this fucking
bitch just walks in.

48:14.386 --> 48:15.720
I don't fucking know her.

48:15.754 --> 48:17.156
I don't fucking know her!

48:17.190 --> 48:19.691
No, no, no, this is your
house. This is your house.

48:19.724 --> 48:21.393
- It is, right?
- Yeah, that's Samantha.

48:21.426 --> 48:23.328
- Sam.
- I don't know Sam.

48:23.361 --> 48:24.696
Man, you've been
together for a while.

48:24.729 --> 48:27.833
Shit, you've known her
longer than you've known me.

48:27.866 --> 48:28.867
- I have?
- Yeah.

48:30.702 --> 48:31.670
Look at your chest.

48:32.838 --> 48:34.339
Look, look, look.

48:34.372 --> 48:35.174
Here.

48:40.679 --> 48:41.446
You see?

48:42.714 --> 48:44.616
Ben, you're sick,
man, you got NIA.

48:47.086 --> 48:49.754
You had it for awhile, it's
making you forget shit.

48:51.456 --> 48:52.924
Sam's been helping you through.

48:55.194 --> 48:56.695
Yeah, you guys are
great together, man.

48:56.728 --> 48:58.697
Shit, you make music
together. You're awesome.

49:01.433 --> 49:02.235
Hey.

49:04.203 --> 49:05.271
Hey!

49:05.304 --> 49:06.638
It's not your fault, man.

49:08.907 --> 49:09.808
Can I take this?

49:13.645 --> 49:15.114
Come on, man.

49:20.785 --> 49:21.786
Okay.

49:21.820 --> 49:23.289
Why the fuck me, man?

49:23.322 --> 49:24.723
Just relax, bud.

49:24.756 --> 49:27.026
- Why the fuck me?
- Relax, it's not your fault.

49:32.965 --> 49:33.865
Ben Richards was

49:33.899 --> 49:35.467
from Hidalgo County, Texas.

49:36.768 --> 49:39.105
He's a songwriter,
and like many,

49:39.138 --> 49:41.240
believed that music
would save the world.

49:43.642 --> 49:44.743
It's wrong.

49:44.776 --> 49:47.246
The ambiance is
so... it's wrong.

49:47.280 --> 49:48.413
Huh?

49:49.315 --> 49:50.815
I'm gonna go record outside.

49:51.917 --> 49:53.885
It's all wrong,
let's get outta here.

49:53.919 --> 49:55.787
Remember the counts?

49:55.820 --> 49:57.789
- I can't remember.
- No, man.

49:57.822 --> 49:58.623
Why not?

50:01.360 --> 50:02.128
His mother was Lizette

50:02.161 --> 50:03.162
and his father was Dave,

50:04.763 --> 50:06.966
and since he moved away he
called them every Sunday.

50:14.639 --> 50:15.840
We're trying to have a baby.

50:15.874 --> 50:17.509
Sam!

50:17.542 --> 50:18.743
We've been together for
so long, it's about time.

50:18.777 --> 50:20.612
Sam,
that's so exciting!

50:20.645 --> 50:21.948
Yeah.

50:21.981 --> 50:22.847
When
he first started to lose

50:22.881 --> 50:24.951
his memory Ben kept it a secret.

50:26.785 --> 50:29.454
Just like everyone
did back then.

50:38.663 --> 50:40.333
Ben could turn any
room into a concert

50:40.366 --> 50:41.566
when he was inclined to.

50:43.069 --> 50:43.902
That was his gift.

50:47.739 --> 50:49.075
This is who we all remembered.

50:52.144 --> 50:53.578
Who we were clutching on to.

51:24.110 --> 51:25.877
Don't fall in.

51:25.910 --> 51:26.811
Don't.

51:26.845 --> 51:27.480
- Will you come-
- Don't, Jude.

51:27.512 --> 51:28.680
Honestly, Jude.

51:28.713 --> 51:29.482
- Do not fall in.
- Don't you fucking d...

51:29.514 --> 51:30.383
This is so scary,

51:30.416 --> 51:31.417
- do not do that.
- Emma, no!

51:31.450 --> 51:33.085
Stop, stop it, stop.

51:33.119 --> 51:34.220
You're gonna get us in trouble.

51:34.253 --> 51:35.988
- You jump, I jump!
- Stop it.

51:36.022 --> 51:38.723
Get off me, I'm trying
to see the whales.

51:38.757 --> 51:41.994
Oh yeah, I got told
if we're gonna see one

51:42.028 --> 51:42.861
it's gonna be right here.

51:42.894 --> 51:43.895
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

51:43.929 --> 51:44.930
Okay.

51:48.467 --> 51:49.701
You all right? Do
you want anything?

51:49.734 --> 51:51.736
Um, I'll have a tea.

51:51.770 --> 51:52.737
If they've got tea, black tea.

51:52.771 --> 51:53.638
Yeah? Okay.

51:56.042 --> 51:58.044
If you see one
tell him to wait.

51:58.077 --> 51:59.644
I will just for you.

52:05.151 --> 52:07.353
- Jude!
- Yeah, what?

52:07.386 --> 52:08.154
Nothing.

52:22.134 --> 52:24.602
All right, we're just getting
word into the newsroom now.

52:24.636 --> 52:27.872
Moments ago DPC issued
a statement indicating

52:27.906 --> 52:31.410
that the early results of their
controversial NIA treatments

52:31.444 --> 52:34.113
are quote
overwhelmingly positive.

52:34.146 --> 52:36.148
Now, in that same
statement they also say

52:36.182 --> 52:38.317
that due to overwhelming
demand that they

52:38.350 --> 52:41.287
are not able to accept
any new applicants.

52:41.320 --> 52:42.887
What do you make of that?

52:42.921 --> 52:45.558
I guess if this treatment
is having some success,

52:45.590 --> 52:47.059
that's wonderful news.

52:47.093 --> 52:49.562
Overwhelmingly positive
certainly sounds like they

52:49.594 --> 52:50.963
- might be onto something.
- What can I get you?

52:50.996 --> 52:52.797
It does, but
they have already closed off

52:52.831 --> 52:54.899
a very selective monitor
to the general public

52:54.934 --> 52:58.070
and I assume that
the FDA has been-

52:58.104 --> 52:59.438
- Tea.

52:59.472 --> 53:00.738
There are
people with loved ones

53:00.772 --> 53:04.143
who are afflicted with
this who want a chance.

53:06.811 --> 53:09.281
Stop, don't touch me!

53:10.483 --> 53:12.017
Stop here!

53:12.051 --> 53:14.086
Stop it!
Get away from me!

53:14.120 --> 53:16.589
Stop! Stop it!

53:16.621 --> 53:18.357
Stop! Turn
the boat around!

53:18.390 --> 53:19.691
Stop the boat!

53:19.724 --> 53:21.360
We have to go back,
we have to go back.

53:21.393 --> 53:22.461
Stop!

53:22.495 --> 53:24.563
I don't know who you are!

53:25.697 --> 53:27.199
- Help me!
- Stop her!

53:28.234 --> 53:29.168
- Stop her!
- Help me!

53:29.201 --> 53:30.503
- Okay.
- Help me!

53:30.536 --> 53:31.669
- What's happening?
- Help!

53:31.703 --> 53:32.972
Turn the boat around!

53:33.005 --> 53:34.639
No, stop touching me, please.

53:34.672 --> 53:35.941
Just get away from me.

53:35.975 --> 53:37.842
We have to go back, please!

53:37.876 --> 53:39.777
Don't! Stop it!

53:39.811 --> 53:41.981
Back off, back up.

53:42.014 --> 53:43.182
Get away!

53:45.151 --> 53:46.185
Em?

53:46.218 --> 53:47.685
Go back,
we need to go back!

53:47.719 --> 53:49.054
- Em?
- Jude!

53:49.088 --> 53:50.356
Em!

53:59.999 --> 54:00.633
Hurry!

54:00.665 --> 54:02.201
Throw it in!

54:02.234 --> 54:03.868
Turn the boat around!

54:10.209 --> 54:12.777
Overwhelmingly positive results.

54:14.346 --> 54:16.982
The first sign of a cure
and they shut everyone out.

54:20.752 --> 54:22.288
It's no wonder people
are going crazy.

54:26.058 --> 54:29.028
And while they went crazy
all we could do was wait.

54:30.062 --> 54:31.931
Wait to hear that we got an in.

54:31.964 --> 54:34.033
Wait to hear that we
were gonna be okay.

54:37.203 --> 54:38.337
We're gonna be okay.

54:38.370 --> 54:39.672
This procedure works.

54:39.704 --> 54:42.041
A viral video is
causing a stir today

54:42.074 --> 54:46.078
of a Dr. Sam Tomlin of
the DPC walking viewers

54:46.111 --> 54:49.448
through a step-by-step
tutorial of the procedure

54:49.481 --> 54:52.717
which supposedly puts
a halt to NIA symptoms.

54:54.220 --> 54:56.055
Already we're getting reports
from local emergency rooms

54:56.088 --> 54:58.691
of more than a dozen new
patients who've attempted

54:58.723 --> 55:00.593
the procedure on themselves.

55:02.461 --> 55:03.662
We're gonna be okay.

55:04.997 --> 55:06.365
We have increased
police presence

55:06.398 --> 55:09.935
and cannot stress enough
this is not a proven cure.

55:09.969 --> 55:11.270
Step back now!

55:11.303 --> 55:13.639
It is, at
best, a promising lead

55:13.672 --> 55:15.040
in the road to a cure.

55:16.275 --> 55:18.244
We urge everyone to remain calm.

55:21.981 --> 55:24.816
We're gonna be okay.

55:30.422 --> 55:31.190
Hello?

55:33.158 --> 55:33.959
Yes, speaking.

55:41.634 --> 55:43.469
Sorry, I thought
he was already in.

55:47.439 --> 55:50.609
Yeah, that's...
that's not possible.

55:50.643 --> 55:53.345
Um, can I speak to
Dr. Dormer please?

55:57.650 --> 55:59.418
Well, can I talk to someone?

55:59.451 --> 56:00.486
Who's your supervisor?

56:02.121 --> 56:03.255
Yeah, but there's been a mistake

56:03.289 --> 56:04.523
and you need to check again.

56:07.126 --> 56:09.962
Or I need to someone
who can sort it out.

56:09.995 --> 56:11.096
Fine.

56:11.130 --> 56:14.199
Yeah, fine.

56:14.233 --> 56:15.100
Fuck.

56:15.134 --> 56:16.135
Jude.

56:18.836 --> 56:19.705
They said they didn't
take you 'cause you've

56:19.738 --> 56:20.973
got drugs in your system.

56:22.174 --> 56:23.475
What?

56:23.509 --> 56:25.477
You know what
they're talking about?

56:25.511 --> 56:26.779
Nope.

56:26.811 --> 56:28.213
Jude, you can't lie
to me about this stuff.

56:28.247 --> 56:30.983
Emma, I swear to God, I've
been sober for five years.

56:31.016 --> 56:33.152
You know that, I wouldn't
just fuck things up like that.

56:33.185 --> 56:33.986
So what? They're just lying?

56:34.019 --> 56:35.554
Unless it's a mistake.

56:35.587 --> 56:36.488
What did they say?

56:37.723 --> 56:40.225
They said they found
cocaine in your system

56:40.259 --> 56:42.328
and now you can't get
the procedure done.

56:43.762 --> 56:44.730
Is that true?

56:44.763 --> 56:46.231
No, it can't be true.

56:52.904 --> 56:53.706
Jude.

56:55.541 --> 56:56.342
Fuck.

56:57.743 --> 56:58.544
What?

57:00.012 --> 57:03.549
I ran into an old
friend from way back

57:03.582 --> 57:05.551
and I used to party
a lot with him.

57:07.252 --> 57:08.520
I thought we just caught up.

57:12.291 --> 57:15.294
I don't remember, but that's
the only time I could've...

57:19.264 --> 57:21.400
So it's possible, then.

57:40.486 --> 57:42.221
I just need a minute.

57:48.961 --> 57:51.029
Damn.

58:12.851 --> 58:14.853
I can't do this.

58:23.028 --> 58:24.563
What do you mean?

58:24.596 --> 58:28.267
He's been forgetting
pieces of himself

58:28.300 --> 58:31.336
for the last six months.

58:35.040 --> 58:36.275
Tonight he just forgot me.

58:37.709 --> 58:38.977
Oh, darling.

58:39.011 --> 58:40.446
This is going to get worse.

58:44.383 --> 58:45.884
I love him, Emma.

58:47.352 --> 58:49.021
I love him so much.

58:52.658 --> 58:54.393
But it's a sinking ship.

58:55.727 --> 58:59.231
I can either tie myself to
him and get dragged down

59:00.699 --> 59:05.704
or cut loose and
try to stay alive.

59:10.008 --> 59:11.643
I understand, but-

59:11.677 --> 59:14.112
- I don't think you
understand, Emma.

59:14.146 --> 59:17.483
I truly hope you never
have to understand.

59:17.516 --> 59:21.520
The man who promised he
was gonna love me forever,

59:23.322 --> 59:26.325
he just tried to stab
me with a kitchen knife

59:26.358 --> 59:27.826
that my mother gave him.

59:29.328 --> 59:31.563
What the fuck am I
supposed to do right now?

59:35.400 --> 59:36.835
They lost each other.

59:42.441 --> 59:43.342
But I won't lose you.

59:48.247 --> 59:49.715
Tell me about our first kiss.

59:55.754 --> 59:56.555
Jude.

1:00:01.961 --> 1:00:06.465
The walls, there were
these black shapes.

1:00:14.373 --> 1:00:15.908
Well, I don't
remember the walls.

1:00:17.910 --> 1:00:19.244
Can I kiss you?

1:00:21.113 --> 1:00:23.482
Our first kiss can't
be in line for the loo.

1:00:24.816 --> 1:00:25.584
I didn't say that.

1:00:25.617 --> 1:00:26.518
No?

1:00:26.552 --> 1:00:29.354
No, I said I'm not available.

1:00:29.388 --> 1:00:31.189
Right, Tim.

1:00:31.223 --> 1:00:32.357
Tom.

1:00:32.391 --> 1:00:33.559
But I thought
his name was Tim.

1:00:33.592 --> 1:00:35.028
Yeah, but you
always called him Tom.

1:00:35.060 --> 1:00:36.728
- Tom.
- Tim.

1:00:36.762 --> 1:00:37.563
Tim.

1:00:38.998 --> 1:00:40.632
That's even worse.

1:00:40.666 --> 1:00:41.867
So, do you love him?

1:00:41.900 --> 1:00:43.569
- No.
- No?

1:00:43.602 --> 1:00:45.904
You didn't even have
to think about it.

1:00:45.939 --> 1:00:47.239
No, I didn't.

1:00:50.009 --> 1:00:51.243
Tell me about the walls.

1:00:53.980 --> 1:00:55.514
I don't remember the walls.

1:01:10.862 --> 1:01:12.097
What's this?

1:01:12.999 --> 1:01:14.600
It's a picture of you.

1:01:19.504 --> 1:01:20.539
What's this?

1:01:24.643 --> 1:01:25.945
Do you know who I am?

1:01:25.979 --> 1:01:27.013
You're Emma.

1:01:28.213 --> 1:01:30.315
Then why'd you have
to write this down?

1:01:30.349 --> 1:01:31.483
I'm doing my best.

1:01:36.055 --> 1:01:37.656
When were we married, Jude?

1:01:42.794 --> 1:01:44.363
April.

1:01:44.396 --> 1:01:46.798
No, uh, August.

1:01:46.832 --> 1:01:47.566
August?

1:01:49.167 --> 1:01:50.636
When did we get married, Jude?

1:01:52.671 --> 1:01:57.643
Uh, it was a
Wednesday in August.

1:01:58.410 --> 1:01:59.778
Just...

1:01:59.811 --> 1:02:01.047
Just focus on the details,
the memory has dozens

1:02:01.080 --> 1:02:02.481
of threads to the
other memories.

1:02:02.514 --> 1:02:05.384
Was it in a church?

1:02:12.357 --> 1:02:13.659
I don't know.

1:02:14.493 --> 1:02:15.661
Was it a big wedding?

1:02:20.666 --> 1:02:22.200
Steps.

1:02:22.234 --> 1:02:23.136
Steps.

1:02:23.168 --> 1:02:24.536
Yeah, we kissed on some steps.

1:02:25.737 --> 1:02:29.042
It was a Thursday,
it was just us,

1:02:29.075 --> 1:02:31.510
we decided we didn't
wanna wait until the date.

1:02:32.577 --> 1:02:34.579
What color
was the dress?

1:02:34.613 --> 1:02:35.414
White.

1:02:38.417 --> 1:02:39.217
Blue.

1:02:41.853 --> 1:02:44.456
Do you remember who was there?

1:02:58.537 --> 1:02:59.538
Uh...

1:03:04.409 --> 1:03:05.210
Ben.

1:03:07.146 --> 1:03:08.714
Samantha.

1:03:08.747 --> 1:03:10.549
Congratulations.

1:03:10.582 --> 1:03:12.118
I love you, I'm so happy.

1:03:12.151 --> 1:03:14.020
He played us a song.

1:03:14.053 --> 1:03:16.189
- I wrote this for you.
- No, no, no.

1:03:16.221 --> 1:03:18.623
He gave us a song.

1:03:20.492 --> 1:03:21.293
Our song.

1:04:08.874 --> 1:04:10.809
Close your eyes.

1:04:10.842 --> 1:04:11.610
Why?

1:04:11.643 --> 1:04:12.911
Just close 'em.

1:04:23.022 --> 1:04:25.557
Do you remember meeting me?

1:04:31.830 --> 1:04:32.798
A waterpark.

1:04:34.332 --> 1:04:38.637
I remember a waterpark and
it was October, it was cold.

1:04:40.705 --> 1:04:41.974
Hi.

1:04:42.008 --> 1:04:43.742
It was the day they
shutdown the park.

1:04:44.676 --> 1:04:46.212
Everything was going
outta business,

1:04:46.245 --> 1:04:48.547
every day was
something's last day.

1:04:51.483 --> 1:04:52.651
We were the
oldest people there.

1:04:52.684 --> 1:04:54.419
We were the only people there.

1:05:03.428 --> 1:05:05.330
I was so sad
the day I met you.

1:05:08.366 --> 1:05:09.634
Why?

1:05:09.668 --> 1:05:11.170
Can't remember.

1:05:12.704 --> 1:05:14.840
I just know that after I saw
you I wasn't sad anymore.

1:05:29.888 --> 1:05:32.791
We were married October
14th of last year.

1:05:33.725 --> 1:05:34.759
We didn't have a wedding,

1:05:34.793 --> 1:05:36.761
we just went right
to the courthouse.

1:05:38.763 --> 1:05:40.333
Ben and Sam were there.

1:05:40.365 --> 1:05:41.466
Your dad was there.

1:05:42.400 --> 1:05:43.768
Your friends, my friends.

1:05:45.403 --> 1:05:47.240
It was a mad dash
with no warning and

1:05:48.140 --> 1:05:49.908
still so many people made it.

1:05:53.411 --> 1:05:55.047
I'm so sorry I don't remember.

1:05:58.583 --> 1:06:00.485
It's not your fault, though.

1:06:13.732 --> 1:06:16.635
I haven't
forgotten how I feel.

1:06:24.277 --> 1:06:26.745
So much to remember.

1:06:26.778 --> 1:06:28.080
All these little pieces.

1:06:30.316 --> 1:06:32.018
For some people
NIA is a slow drip,

1:06:33.286 --> 1:06:34.920
for others it's a
stop all at once.

1:06:36.521 --> 1:06:37.522
For you it's slow.

1:06:44.663 --> 1:06:45.463
This can work.

1:06:48.935 --> 1:06:49.969
Okay, left!

1:06:51.503 --> 1:06:52.504
No, my left!

1:06:54.439 --> 1:06:55.341
Keep going!

1:06:56.508 --> 1:06:57.742
Perfect!

1:06:57.776 --> 1:06:59.844
Pretty fucking cool, huh?

1:07:01.513 --> 1:07:02.747
Yeah, it's cool!

1:07:02.781 --> 1:07:03.548
Hang on.

1:07:09.188 --> 1:07:11.023
Every
day he rediscovers the city.

1:07:11.057 --> 1:07:12.657
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck!

1:07:12.691 --> 1:07:13.960
Places
we had known in special ways

1:07:13.993 --> 1:07:16.295
were strange again.

1:07:16.329 --> 1:07:17.696
Move back.

1:07:17.729 --> 1:07:18.530
All right.

1:07:23.468 --> 1:07:24.669
I think it took.

1:07:24.703 --> 1:07:26.339
Some things were easy.

1:07:30.809 --> 1:07:31.978
Hang on.

1:07:32.011 --> 1:07:34.512
And
some things are hard.

1:07:34.546 --> 1:07:35.982
Have we been here before?

1:07:40.019 --> 1:07:41.519
No.

1:07:41.553 --> 1:07:42.921
No, we haven't.

1:07:45.224 --> 1:07:47.093
Because
his losses were mine, too.

1:07:53.332 --> 1:07:54.899
What the?

1:07:54.934 --> 1:07:56.469
What is this, a fish?

1:07:56.501 --> 1:07:57.236
Yeah.

1:07:57.269 --> 1:07:58.903
I got it with you.

1:07:59.904 --> 1:08:00.839
Do you like it?

1:08:02.375 --> 1:08:04.410
What, what, what?

1:08:04.443 --> 1:08:05.211
What?

1:08:05.244 --> 1:08:06.379
Oh, my God.

1:08:07.879 --> 1:08:11.750
No!

1:08:11.783 --> 1:08:14.053
- We got matching tats.
- We did indeed.

1:08:15.021 --> 1:08:15.988
Do I know you better

1:08:16.022 --> 1:08:17.189
than you know yourself?

1:08:18.057 --> 1:08:20.192
Right now, maybe.

1:08:21.093 --> 1:08:22.428
Why did we tattoo fish?

1:08:30.369 --> 1:08:32.038
- Oh, thank god!
- What?

1:08:34.073 --> 1:08:35.107
Oh shit, I couldn't, uh...

1:08:37.376 --> 1:08:40.046
I knew that we lived on
Ormand but I couldn't remember

1:08:40.079 --> 1:08:41.746
which door so I just
knocked on 'em all

1:08:41.780 --> 1:08:44.549
and nobody wanted to help me.

1:08:44.582 --> 1:08:45.384
Darling.

1:08:46.718 --> 1:08:47.719
Here you go.

1:08:50.588 --> 1:08:51.390
It's okay.

1:08:52.891 --> 1:08:54.460
- I
- find myself wondering how

1:08:54.493 --> 1:08:56.895
to build a future if you keep
having to rebuild the past.

1:08:58.931 --> 1:09:01.033
Yeah, it woulda been
nice to know that I fucking

1:09:01.067 --> 1:09:02.634
had this and I don't know.

1:09:06.638 --> 1:09:09.175
Life goes
forwards, not backwards.

1:09:13.079 --> 1:09:15.481
I'm still reading about
the brain, taking notes.

1:09:18.084 --> 1:09:21.853
I don't know, feeling
like I'm doing something.

1:09:31.696 --> 1:09:32.498
Mom?

1:09:34.533 --> 1:09:37.303
<i>Uh, is
this Emma Ryerson?</i>

1:09:37.336 --> 1:09:39.004
Oh my God, is she okay?

1:09:39.038 --> 1:09:41.840
<i>She's all right.
We identified her.</i>

1:09:41.873 --> 1:09:44.944
<i>She's in the hospital now and
people are looking after her.</i>

1:09:44.977 --> 1:09:46.412
Does she know who she is?

1:09:46.445 --> 1:09:49.014
<i>She knows her
first name. Bits and pieces.</i>

1:09:49.048 --> 1:09:50.116
Um...

1:09:51.716 --> 1:09:56.721
Could you tell her that Emma,
that her daughter loves her

1:09:57.957 --> 1:10:01.260
and I haven't forgotten
and that I'm gonna try

1:10:01.293 --> 1:10:02.894
and be there as soon as I can.

1:10:04.196 --> 1:10:05.965
Would you tell her that please?

1:10:21.180 --> 1:10:23.882
<i>What
were we even trying to save?</i>

1:10:23.915 --> 1:10:25.317
<i>Our experiences together?</i>

1:10:28.053 --> 1:10:30.589
<i>Is that all I love about him?</i>

1:10:34.593 --> 1:10:37.429
<i>I wish I could look at him and
just find what went missing.</i>

1:10:39.165 --> 1:10:40.232
<i>But he looks the same.</i>

1:10:45.037 --> 1:10:46.838
Jude, I'm so tired of this.

1:11:07.226 --> 1:11:10.663
I have to
ask you something.

1:11:10.695 --> 1:11:11.463
Okay.

1:11:13.199 --> 1:11:15.134
I'm not sure how.

1:11:16.268 --> 1:11:17.069
Is it scary?

1:11:19.238 --> 1:11:20.039
Yeah.

1:11:24.076 --> 1:11:28.013
I've been doing some
reading about the procedure

1:11:28.047 --> 1:11:30.082
and what they were
gonna do to me.

1:11:31.417 --> 1:11:32.218
Okay.

1:11:33.785 --> 1:11:35.654
And I was thinking
we could do it.

1:11:36.622 --> 1:11:37.523
Do it?

1:11:37.556 --> 1:11:38.890
Yeah, or you could do it.

1:11:40.125 --> 1:11:40.925
At work.

1:11:42.794 --> 1:11:44.063
Are you being serious?

1:11:45.130 --> 1:11:48.601
Yeah, I know it sounds
crazy, but they have

1:11:48.634 --> 1:11:51.903
these videos online and
they swear that it worked.

1:11:52.904 --> 1:11:54.607
No, they swear that it worked.

1:11:54.640 --> 1:11:57.909
You take this long needle
and you find this nerve

1:11:57.943 --> 1:11:59.078
at the base of the brain-

1:11:59.111 --> 1:12:00.312
- You didn't wanna do
it when professionals

1:12:00.346 --> 1:12:01.614
were gonna do it,
Jude, I'm a vet.

1:12:01.647 --> 1:12:03.315
Yeah, I know,
but I'm going, Em.

1:12:05.084 --> 1:12:06.619
We have to try and
I'm gonna feel better

1:12:06.652 --> 1:12:07.919
knowing that it's you.

1:12:07.953 --> 1:12:08.954
No, you can't
ask me to do that.

1:12:08.988 --> 1:12:10.122
No, but I am asking you.

1:12:12.291 --> 1:12:14.126
But what if, um...

1:12:14.159 --> 1:12:16.095
What if something goes
wrong or I hurt you

1:12:16.128 --> 1:12:18.097
or I make it worse or
you get an infection?

1:12:18.130 --> 1:12:19.897
Well, I wouldn't of
asked you if I hadn't

1:12:19.932 --> 1:12:21.300
thought about all of that.

1:12:22.968 --> 1:12:23.768
I trust you.

1:12:26.272 --> 1:12:27.839
I don't know what else to do.

1:12:34.146 --> 1:12:35.880
I don't know what else there is.

1:13:11.250 --> 1:13:13.986
Stay here, I'm
gonna go and check.

1:13:35.708 --> 1:13:37.209
Okay, we're all safe.

1:13:38.944 --> 1:13:41.180
<i>This ridge should
soften into a membrane</i>

1:13:41.213 --> 1:13:42.548
<i>that will give a little
when you push it.</i>

1:13:42.581 --> 1:13:44.849
<i>This area will be
the puncture point.</i>

1:13:44.882 --> 1:13:46.218
Okay.

1:13:46.251 --> 1:13:48.886
Okay, this is what we
use to open dog's mouths

1:13:48.920 --> 1:13:50.888
when we clean the teeth.

1:13:50.922 --> 1:13:53.225
It won't really fit, but it
will stop you from biting.

1:13:54.426 --> 1:13:55.227
Wider.

1:13:58.197 --> 1:13:59.231
How's that?

1:13:59.264 --> 1:14:00.032
How do I look?

1:14:18.417 --> 1:14:19.718
Um...

1:14:19.752 --> 1:14:21.620
Carfentanil could kill
you so I'm gonna give you

1:14:21.653 --> 1:14:22.920
some Telazol for the pain-

1:14:24.390 --> 1:14:26.225
- Jude-
- No drugs, I gotta be...

1:14:26.258 --> 1:14:27.292
- I wanna be-
- Jude.

1:14:27.326 --> 1:14:28.861
No, please, fuck that shit.

1:14:28.893 --> 1:14:29.661
Come on.

1:15:00.092 --> 1:15:01.727
You ready?

1:15:04.696 --> 1:15:05.464
- I'm ready.
- You ready?

1:15:05.497 --> 1:15:06.632
Yeah, yeah.

1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:10.636
Take a deep breath.

1:15:10.669 --> 1:15:12.271
Deep breath.

1:15:13.839 --> 1:15:14.606
Breathe.

1:15:14.640 --> 1:15:15.441
Deep breath.

1:15:16.875 --> 1:15:19.378
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:15:23.449 --> 1:15:24.650
You all right?

1:15:24.683 --> 1:15:25.951
You all right?

1:15:25.984 --> 1:15:26.752
Yeah, we got this.

1:15:26.785 --> 1:15:28.020
Come on, come on.

1:15:28.053 --> 1:15:29.455
Yo!

1:15:29.488 --> 1:15:30.789
Yo!

1:15:34.059 --> 1:15:35.761
All right, let's
get it. Come on.

1:15:35.794 --> 1:15:37.362
Are you sure?

1:15:37.396 --> 1:15:38.597
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's
go, let's go, let's go.

1:15:38.630 --> 1:15:42.936
Here we go, come on.

1:15:42.968 --> 1:15:44.536
Okay, deep breath.

1:15:48.207 --> 1:15:50.309
Deep breath, deep
breath, deep breath.

1:15:50.342 --> 1:15:51.109
Deep breath.

1:15:53.245 --> 1:15:54.713
Jude, I don't know.

1:15:58.217 --> 1:15:59.518
Jude, I don't
know, I don't know.

1:16:14.233 --> 1:16:15.167
Close your eyes.

1:16:16.335 --> 1:16:17.402
- Why?
- Just close 'em.

1:16:21.507 --> 1:16:24.176
All right, pretend
we're somewhere hot.

1:16:24.209 --> 1:16:25.844
- Okay.
- Like the jungle.

1:16:25.878 --> 1:16:27.479
No, Hawaii.

1:16:27.513 --> 1:16:28.914
Hawaii?

1:16:28.948 --> 1:16:31.450
All right, so we're in Hawaii.

1:16:32.417 --> 1:16:33.685
Let's pretend we
just got married.

1:16:33.719 --> 1:16:35.320
We did
just get married.

1:16:35.354 --> 1:16:36.755
Oh yeah.

1:16:36.788 --> 1:16:40.092
So, all right, it's our
honeymoon, we're in Hawaii,

1:16:40.125 --> 1:16:44.496
and we're in the water
but you gotta sneak off

1:16:44.530 --> 1:16:49.535
because there is
jellyfish and sharks.

1:16:50.035 --> 1:16:51.336
And the water is
dead clear so I'll be

1:16:51.370 --> 1:16:52.571
able to spot 'em a mile away.

1:16:52.604 --> 1:16:54.139
No, but it's like
three a.m. so it's dark.

1:16:56.475 --> 1:16:59.378
And if you look out
onto the horizon

1:16:59.411 --> 1:17:01.513
you can see like
la lightnening storm=.

1:17:01.547 --> 1:17:02.781
Am I naked?

1:17:02.814 --> 1:17:04.783
Hell yeah, it's a
honeymoon. Always.

1:17:05.617 --> 1:17:06.852
Me, too.

1:17:06.885 --> 1:17:08.053
Sounds perfect.

1:17:08.921 --> 1:17:09.721
Yeah.

1:17:10.923 --> 1:17:13.392
Perfect Hawaiian honeymoon.

1:17:13.425 --> 1:17:15.594
Don't ever forget it.

1:17:23.769 --> 1:17:24.570
Easy.

1:17:26.405 --> 1:17:27.172
Easy.

1:17:29.508 --> 1:17:30.876
What happened?

1:17:30.909 --> 1:17:31.710
You blacked out.

1:17:31.743 --> 1:17:32.946
- I blacked out?
- Yeah.

1:17:34.680 --> 1:17:36.081
Jude, slowly, slowly.

1:17:41.620 --> 1:17:43.288
Oh.

1:17:43.322 --> 1:17:44.122
Did we get it?

1:17:45.090 --> 1:17:46.124
I'm not sure.

1:17:46.158 --> 1:17:47.793
How long was I out for?

1:17:47.826 --> 1:17:48.627
10 minutes.

1:17:49.828 --> 1:17:50.762
Oh, for God sake, Jude.

1:17:50.796 --> 1:17:51.998
It was so scary.

1:18:07.179 --> 1:18:08.447
Did I hurt ya?

1:18:10.449 --> 1:18:11.483
Did I help ya?

1:18:19.391 --> 1:18:20.525
How long until we'll know?

1:18:46.518 --> 1:18:47.552
You going somewhere?

1:18:49.688 --> 1:18:50.489
Who are you?

1:18:52.357 --> 1:18:53.158
What?

1:18:55.861 --> 1:18:56.628
Oh, fuck off.

1:18:56.662 --> 1:18:58.397
Fuck off, Jude.

1:18:58.430 --> 1:18:59.765
For fuck's sake!

1:19:00.866 --> 1:19:02.035
That's so annoying!

1:19:02.068 --> 1:19:03.335
How could you tell?

1:19:03.368 --> 1:19:04.870
I could see you chew
your lip you were trying

1:19:04.903 --> 1:19:06.905
to do your stupid
smile you stupid twat.

1:19:06.939 --> 1:19:08.840
- Sorry.
- Oh, thank you.

1:19:08.874 --> 1:19:10.175
Good morning.

1:19:16.748 --> 1:19:17.984
Hey, can we take the
car, just go do like

1:19:18.017 --> 1:19:19.351
a road trip or something?

1:19:20.552 --> 1:19:22.187
Put this guy in the back seat.

1:19:24.123 --> 1:19:24.890
Do you feel up for that?

1:19:24.923 --> 1:19:25.724
Yeah.

1:19:26.558 --> 1:19:28.027
Yeah, I could use the air.

1:19:47.546 --> 1:19:49.347
Out of all the concerts
that you've been to,

1:19:49.381 --> 1:19:50.882
what was the worst?

1:19:52.451 --> 1:19:54.252
Uh...

1:19:54.286 --> 1:19:57.522
Oh, I saw Courtney
Love in Vegas.

1:19:57.556 --> 1:20:01.727
She came out, sang
one line, and got hit

1:20:01.760 --> 1:20:03.862
with a chocolate bar and left.

1:20:03.895 --> 1:20:05.131
No.

1:20:05.164 --> 1:20:06.465
She said, "Fuck
you, Las Vegas!"

1:20:08.134 --> 1:20:09.068
And then she left.

1:20:10.602 --> 1:20:11.971
What about you?

1:20:12.004 --> 1:20:13.805
Uh, you at karaoke last year.

1:20:15.307 --> 1:20:19.244
Absolutely traumatic experience
for me and everyone around.

1:20:19.277 --> 1:20:20.312
Traumatic?

1:20:20.345 --> 1:20:21.580
Oh, completely tone deaf.

1:20:22.748 --> 1:20:24.150
It's good you have
hands, though.

1:20:25.517 --> 1:20:28.453
Everything shuts down
when you start singing.

1:20:28.487 --> 1:20:31.224
♪ Do do do do ♪

1:20:31.256 --> 1:20:33.425
♪ Do do do do ♪

1:20:33.458 --> 1:20:34.626
♪ Do be do be be ♪

1:20:34.659 --> 1:20:36.328
It's the face
that you do as well.

1:20:36.361 --> 1:20:37.796
I can't even look at ya.

1:20:39.431 --> 1:20:42.034
I folded my ears in on
themselves 'cause I can't do it.

1:21:00.886 --> 1:21:02.754
- Oh, is that fun?
- Blue!

1:21:02.788 --> 1:21:03.990
Is that fun?

1:21:04.023 --> 1:21:04.823
Blue, Blue!

1:21:04.856 --> 1:21:06.591
- Catalog, Blue.
- Blue!

1:21:06.625 --> 1:21:07.659
Yeah, boy.

1:21:07.692 --> 1:21:09.128
Have you got the key?

1:21:09.162 --> 1:21:10.263
Huh?

1:21:10.295 --> 1:21:12.165
Have you got the key?

1:21:12.198 --> 1:21:13.698
Yeah, he said the mailbox.

1:21:24.010 --> 1:21:24.810
No?

1:21:28.680 --> 1:21:29.481
Hang on.

1:21:43.562 --> 1:21:45.330
- He must have forgot.
- Okay.

1:21:55.208 --> 1:21:57.742
I still have no news on my mom.

1:21:57.776 --> 1:21:58.543
Still?

1:21:59.411 --> 1:22:01.080
Did you try your aunt?

1:22:01.113 --> 1:22:02.714
Yeah, I've tried her as well.

1:22:17.896 --> 1:22:21.033
Yeah, I got something
I need to say to you

1:22:21.067 --> 1:22:23.069
but it doesn't feel
like the right time.

1:22:24.036 --> 1:22:25.804
But I don't feel
like I can wait.

1:22:26.805 --> 1:22:27.606
Okay.

1:22:30.109 --> 1:22:31.710
Uh...

1:22:32.711 --> 1:22:35.714
I wrote it down so I
wouldn't mess it up.

1:22:50.062 --> 1:22:54.300
There's no easy way to say
this, but it didn't work.

1:23:12.351 --> 1:23:14.753
I woke up this morning and
I didn't recognize you.

1:23:29.268 --> 1:23:30.835
So it definitely didn't work.

1:23:33.973 --> 1:23:35.975
Emma, now I'm starting
to forget even you.

1:23:43.015 --> 1:23:46.751
Dear Emma, I wanted
to write this to you,

1:23:46.785 --> 1:23:49.322
I wanted to say this
to you while I still

1:23:49.355 --> 1:23:50.822
have as much of me as I do.

1:23:52.959 --> 1:23:55.860
Every morning I wake
up and I have to look

1:23:55.894 --> 1:23:57.762
at Polaroids with
names on 'em just so

1:23:57.796 --> 1:23:59.398
I can remember that he's Blue.

1:24:00.665 --> 1:24:03.468
Or like this
morning when we left

1:24:03.501 --> 1:24:05.804
I had to let you go out
first because I couldn't

1:24:05.837 --> 1:24:07.173
remember which car was ours.

1:24:12.244 --> 1:24:16.781
There's chaos all around
us, people freaking out

1:24:16.815 --> 1:24:19.218
looking for cures, we're
losing our friends,

1:24:19.251 --> 1:24:22.821
you're losing your mom,
borders are sealed,

1:24:22.854 --> 1:24:24.156
flights are grounded,

1:24:24.190 --> 1:24:27.159
and people are getting
lost on their own streets.

1:24:28.827 --> 1:24:30.829
And in the middle of it
it feels like it's just us

1:24:30.862 --> 1:24:32.431
doing whatever the fuck we can.

1:24:35.935 --> 1:24:38.570
So I wanted to come out
here while it's still quiet

1:24:40.872 --> 1:24:44.642
so that I could look
you in the eye in case

1:24:44.676 --> 1:24:49.681
before I'm all gone and tell
you that you are the love

1:24:50.882 --> 1:24:54.719
of my life because you
make me laugh every day

1:24:55.955 --> 1:24:58.590
and you make my life worth
living and you make me

1:24:58.623 --> 1:25:00.026
feel like I'm not alone.

1:25:01.961 --> 1:25:06.966
And if things were normal,
then you'd be the person

1:25:08.467 --> 1:25:10.535
that'd make it okay that I
gotta grow old and die someday

1:25:10.568 --> 1:25:13.939
because at least I got to spend
some of that time with you.

1:25:17.243 --> 1:25:22.248
But things aren't normal
and so I guess instead,

1:25:24.582 --> 1:25:28.653
or as well, I love you
because you stayed.

1:25:29.888 --> 1:25:31.190
Because when things got scary

1:25:31.223 --> 1:25:33.459
you knuckled down
and you stayed.

1:25:36.761 --> 1:25:38.264
And you got me through each day.

1:25:42.101 --> 1:25:45.171
And I hope I did the same
for you, or I hope that

1:25:46.571 --> 1:25:48.941
I can still do the
same for you somehow.

1:26:05.491 --> 1:26:09.428
Yeah, yeah, I just had to
because I feel we gotta be real.

1:26:09.462 --> 1:26:14.467
Yeah.

1:26:51.971 --> 1:26:54.173
What's this? Come on.

1:26:54.206 --> 1:26:55.007
Come on.

1:26:58.410 --> 1:26:59.578
Oh, come here.

1:27:01.046 --> 1:27:02.381
Yeah, yeah.

1:27:03.748 --> 1:27:04.950
You can't get that stick.

1:27:04.984 --> 1:27:08.120
You can't get there first.

1:27:08.154 --> 1:27:09.321
You can't get that stick.

1:27:09.355 --> 1:27:11.123
You can't get that stick.

1:27:11.157 --> 1:27:12.057
- Hey!
- Hey.

1:27:14.160 --> 1:27:15.027
This dog's cool.

1:27:17.263 --> 1:27:18.998
His name's Blue.

1:27:19.031 --> 1:27:20.533
Oh, Blue! Yeah.

1:27:22.101 --> 1:27:23.169
Yeah.

1:27:23.202 --> 1:27:25.070
Yeah, Blue. Come on.

1:27:27.705 --> 1:27:28.740
What?

1:27:28.773 --> 1:27:30.042
Come on.

1:27:42.955 --> 1:27:44.889
Oh no, are
they turning us around?

1:27:44.923 --> 1:27:46.891
Uh, I don't know.

1:27:56.635 --> 1:27:58.270
IDs please.

1:27:58.304 --> 1:28:00.072
Is this road
closed, sir, or what?

1:28:00.105 --> 1:28:01.073
Just the IDs.

1:28:01.106 --> 1:28:02.208
Why?

1:28:02.241 --> 1:28:04.009
Government
mandated for

1:28:04.043 --> 1:28:06.045
the missing persons database.

1:28:06.078 --> 1:28:07.079
We're not missing.

1:28:09.315 --> 1:28:10.115
Not yet.

1:28:11.617 --> 1:28:13.085
Okay, go on through.

1:28:28.133 --> 1:28:29.201
How many today?

1:28:29.235 --> 1:28:30.069
Oh, just one.

1:28:31.803 --> 1:28:33.539
Maybe people are remembering
to close their gates.

1:28:33.572 --> 1:28:34.739
Yeah, well, I've got that.

1:28:34.772 --> 1:28:36.141
Cheers.

1:28:36.175 --> 1:28:37.076
Here you are.

1:28:39.078 --> 1:28:40.145
Here you go.

1:28:40.179 --> 1:28:41.180
Thank you.

1:28:45.451 --> 1:28:46.818
- Here.
- Thank you much.

1:28:46.851 --> 1:28:48.354
That'll take care of it.

1:28:49.521 --> 1:28:51.390
Let me give you this.

1:28:51.423 --> 1:28:52.191
Thanks.

1:28:53.758 --> 1:28:58.163
Hey, um, just wondering if
you know where Frank is.

1:28:58.197 --> 1:29:00.099
He's the guy that
usually comes here.

1:29:00.132 --> 1:29:00.966
He's called Frank.

1:29:02.134 --> 1:29:04.802
Frank hasn't
been here in weeks.

1:29:04.836 --> 1:29:05.638
I'm Annie.

1:29:07.106 --> 1:29:08.240
Do you not remember me?

1:29:08.274 --> 1:29:09.742
No, of course I knew,
I was just wondering

1:29:09.774 --> 1:29:12.111
if you've heard from Frank.

1:29:13.679 --> 1:29:17.449
No, I haven't.

1:29:17.483 --> 1:29:19.084
Sorry.

1:29:55.587 --> 1:29:57.723
Where you off to?

1:29:57.756 --> 1:29:58.557
On the hike.

1:30:00.025 --> 1:30:00.892
Why do you wanna go on a hike?

1:30:00.925 --> 1:30:02.361
It's winter, it'll be cold.

1:30:02.394 --> 1:30:04.596
I asked you last night, you
said we could go on a hike.

1:30:07.933 --> 1:30:09.168
Yeah, you're
right, I did say that

1:30:09.201 --> 1:30:11.869
I just didn't think
you'd remember.

1:30:11.903 --> 1:30:13.706
Are you coming or?

1:30:13.739 --> 1:30:15.708
Yeah.

1:30:41.133 --> 1:30:41.899
Come on.

1:30:53.445 --> 1:30:55.247
Beautiful, huh?

1:30:55.280 --> 1:30:56.949
Come on, let's get it.

1:30:56.982 --> 1:30:58.283
What?

1:30:58.317 --> 1:31:00.419
- Let's go, like-
- Oh, Jude.

1:31:01.954 --> 1:31:03.322
Just go like here.

1:31:05.257 --> 1:31:06.125
Right there.

1:31:06.158 --> 1:31:07.259
For fuck's sake.

1:31:10.295 --> 1:31:11.929
What do you want me to do?

1:31:11.964 --> 1:31:13.399
You know, just do your thing.

1:31:16.835 --> 1:31:18.537
Oh, Jude, this is...

1:31:18.570 --> 1:31:19.805
This is gonna look shit.

1:31:21.273 --> 1:31:22.741
Turn around.

1:31:22.775 --> 1:31:24.243
- Nightmare.
- Look, whale.

1:31:37.022 --> 1:31:40.292
Oh, Jude, I'm not
in the mood for this.

1:31:41.360 --> 1:31:42.461
- That's good.
- No.

1:31:42.494 --> 1:31:43.829
- Yeah, walk towards me.
- Enough, enough.

1:31:43.862 --> 1:31:45.464
Yeah, that's good,
that's good, that's good.

1:31:45.497 --> 1:31:47.232
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:31:47.266 --> 1:31:48.233
Yes.

1:31:55.707 --> 1:31:57.276
Oh shit, can I get one more?

1:31:58.377 --> 1:31:59.144
Just here?

1:32:00.312 --> 1:32:02.614
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:32:04.450 --> 1:32:05.484
Yes!

1:32:27.673 --> 1:32:29.708
It's a nice camera.

1:32:29.741 --> 1:32:30.843
I hope it turns out.

1:32:41.220 --> 1:32:42.020
Jude?

1:32:48.527 --> 1:32:49.328
Jude.

1:32:50.729 --> 1:32:51.530
Hey.

1:32:53.265 --> 1:32:54.500
- Jude.
- What?

1:32:54.533 --> 1:32:55.667
- Everything okay?
- No, no, no.

1:32:55.701 --> 1:32:57.402
- What?
- No, no, Jude.

1:32:57.436 --> 1:32:58.904
You all right?

1:32:58.938 --> 1:33:00.072
- No.
- Is there a problem?

1:33:00.105 --> 1:33:01.340
- Jude, who am I?
- Huh?

1:33:01.373 --> 1:33:02.407
- Who am I?
- I don't Know.

1:33:02.441 --> 1:33:03.709
Do not touch me, please.

1:33:03.742 --> 1:33:04.643
No, Jude, look
at me, look at me.

1:33:04.676 --> 1:33:05.644
What, what, can I help?

1:33:05.677 --> 1:33:06.645
- I'm your wife.
- Can I help?

1:33:06.678 --> 1:33:07.981
- What?
- I'm your wife, Emma.

1:33:08.013 --> 1:33:09.515
- All right, I can't do this.
- Jude, Jude.

1:33:09.548 --> 1:33:11.149
- Jude, I'm your wife.
- Out of my personal space

1:33:11.183 --> 1:33:12.384
- here, can you-
- Jude, I'm your wife.

1:33:12.417 --> 1:33:13.318
Jude, look at me. Who am I?

1:33:13.352 --> 1:33:14.853
No, don't touch me, man.

1:33:14.887 --> 1:33:16.522
Look, we left the
house this morning-

1:33:16.555 --> 1:33:17.723
- Are you fucking crazy?

1:33:17.756 --> 1:33:18.657
We left the
house this morning.

1:33:18.690 --> 1:33:19.892
All right, all right, I don't-

1:33:19.925 --> 1:33:21.426
- Who am I and what's
my favorite color?

1:33:21.460 --> 1:33:22.728
- Are you deranged?
- Who am I, what's my fav-

1:33:22.761 --> 1:33:23.862
- Are you deranged?
- Jude, Jude, just relax.

1:33:23.896 --> 1:33:24.763
- Will you not touch me?
- Just relax.

1:33:24.796 --> 1:33:26.865
- Fuck, man.
- Jude.

1:33:26.899 --> 1:33:28.166
- Please, we leave together.
- Will you not touch me?

1:33:28.200 --> 1:33:31.370
- I just told you once.
- Jude, I'm going crazy.

1:33:31.403 --> 1:33:32.538
Please, just look me.

1:33:32.571 --> 1:33:35.507
Jude, look at-

1:33:44.316 --> 1:33:46.351
Listen, I don't know
if you're a psychopath

1:33:46.385 --> 1:33:48.086
or you're sick or
what's going on

1:33:48.120 --> 1:33:50.289
but it's got nothing to
do with me, all right?

1:33:51.256 --> 1:33:52.457
I'm sorry I pushed you.

1:33:57.997 --> 1:34:00.299
I'll see if I can
get you some help.

1:34:06.672 --> 1:34:07.472
Jude!

1:34:26.491 --> 1:34:27.526
Jude.

1:35:48.573 --> 1:35:50.876
<i>I was
so sad the day I met ya.</i>

1:35:54.579 --> 1:35:56.381
Oh, hello.

1:35:57.282 --> 1:35:58.684
Hello.

1:35:58.717 --> 1:35:59.718
Who are you?

1:36:04.623 --> 1:36:08.061
<i>I
can't remember why.</i>
