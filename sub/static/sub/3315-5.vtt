I'm very sorry.

00:11.432 --> 00:13.738
I know these aren't the results
we're hoping for,

00:13.771 --> 00:16.075
but we're at five cycles now,

00:16.109 --> 00:19.550

It's a fertility totem.

It's very old.

02:17.284 --> 02:19.355
Sumerian or Babylonian.

02:19.388 --> 02:21.860
But either way,
you place it under your bed

02:21.894 --> 02:24.900
during intimacy,
and as strange as it may sound,

02:24.933 --> 02:26.837
you get a baby.

02:26.870 --> 02:28.808
Yeah, I know
what you're thinking,

It's the reason I'm here,

or so I've been told
all my life.

02:37.759 --> 02:41.567
I appreciate the thought,
but I can't take this from you.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.403
Sure you can.

02:43.436 --> 02:45.842
I'm not the baby type,
so it's completely wasted on me.

I promise you it works.
You can keep it

02:47.879 --> 02:49.583

you can see anything
in those baby monitors.

12:31.546 --> 12:35.854

I swear I saw him

climbing out of the crib

I feel crazy
just thinking about it.

12:53.389 --> 12:56.095

12:56.128 --> 12:58.265

what's going on in your mind.

12:58.299 --> 13:02.842
Is it possible for a baby
to hate its mother?

13:02.875 --> 13:04.846
You think your baby hates you?

13:04.879 --> 13:07.384
He'll be crying for hours,
and no matter what I do,

13:07.417 --> 13:09.388
I can't get him to settle down.

13:09.421 --> 13:11.960
But then Norma or my husband
holds him for a few seconds,

13:11.993 --> 13:14.097
and he falls asleep instantly.

13:14.131 --> 13:17.972
I think you're talking
about the pickle jar syndrome.

13:18.005 --> 13:19.976
I don't know that one.

13:20.009 --> 13:22.548
You spent two hours
loosening the pickle jar,

13:22.581 --> 13:25.386
and then Norma
and your husband step in

13:25.420 --> 13:27.525
and pop it right open.

13:27.558 --> 13:30.931
‐You see what I mean?
‐Yeah, but it's more.

13:30.964 --> 13:33.870
It's a feeling I get from him.

13:33.904 --> 13:38.412
He's tired
and stressed out, like you.

13:39.916 --> 13:41.886
Maybe even because of you.

13:41.920 --> 13:46.462
Babies can pick up
on stress, you know,

13:46.496 --> 13:50.036
which is maybe why
he's even so fussy.

13:51.506 --> 13:53.877
But to answer you,

13:53.910 --> 13:58.620
no, a baby cannot
hate its mother.

13:58.653 --> 14:00.624
Okay.

14:00.657 --> 14:05.433
But it's not crazy
to sometimes get that feeling.

14:05.466 --> 14:08.172
Do you have anyone
helping you at night?

14:08.205 --> 14:10.577
My husband's on a shoot.

14:10.611 --> 14:12.380
‐What about a night nurse?
‐I don't want

14:12.414 --> 14:14.384
anyone else raising my baby.

14:14.418 --> 14:16.956
I can barely deal
with my housekeeper.

14:16.990 --> 14:21.198
Just for a few weeks
until you find some balance,

14:21.231 --> 14:23.904
until your hormones level out.

14:23.937 --> 14:26.943
I'm sorry, Dr. Berger, but no.

14:26.976 --> 14:30.183
And I don't want
any pills, either.

14:30.216 --> 14:31.920
We don't have to jump
into any medications

14:31.953 --> 14:33.924
‐if you don't want to.
‐Okay.

14:33.957 --> 14:37.531
We can just start off
with some strategies

14:37.565 --> 14:39.334
to help you and your baby.

14:39.367 --> 14:43.209
‐Okay.
‐Now, some might seem
a little new agey.

14:43.242 --> 14:45.079
But that doesn't mean
they don't work.

14:45.113 --> 14:46.381
Okay.

14:48.720 --> 14:51.358
Hey, Aaron. (gasps)
You like that?

14:51.392 --> 14:54.966
‐(Aaron babbling)
‐Oh, that's a nice temperature.

14:54.999 --> 14:58.072
It's very cozy in here. (gasps)

14:58.105 --> 15:00.544
You like your little baby spa,
don't you?

15:00.577 --> 15:02.347
(laughing):
Yeah.

15:02.380 --> 15:04.351
Oh, ready?
I'll get your shoulder

15:04.384 --> 15:06.355
and your elbows

15:06.388 --> 15:10.096
and then your other shoulder
and your other elbow.

15:10.129 --> 15:11.499
What do you think about it?

15:11.533 --> 15:13.035
Oh, yeah.

15:13.068 --> 15:14.371
‐(Aaron babbles)
‐(gasps)

15:14.404 --> 15:18.647
(Liv speaks baby talk)

15:18.680 --> 15:21.251
It's fun in here. (gasps)

15:21.285 --> 15:23.289
Yeah. Oh.

15:23.322 --> 15:25.627
(laughs)

15:27.197 --> 15:29.000
Shh. Shh, shh, shh.

15:35.012 --> 15:37.016
Shh, shh...

15:39.555 --> 15:42.427
Shh. Shh, shh, shh. Shh.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.027
(static)

16:02.233 --> 16:04.037
‐Hey.
‐Listen.
‐(static)

16:04.070 --> 16:06.008
I... I‐I don't...
I don't hear anything.

16:06.041 --> 16:08.145
Exactly. Those detox baths

16:08.179 --> 16:11.151
Berger recommended
are making all the difference.

16:11.185 --> 16:13.557
And the podcast she turned me
onto‐‐ Soothing Waves‐‐

16:13.590 --> 16:18.032
it's like heaven with earbuds,
total decompression.

16:18.065 --> 16:19.702
‐That's great, hon, but I, um...
‐Mm‐hmm.

16:19.735 --> 16:21.573
I got to run. I want to get
some coffee before my audition.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.108
I already made you one.

16:23.142 --> 16:25.012
What?

16:26.481 --> 16:28.452
Oh. That is so sweet, baby.

16:28.485 --> 16:30.456
I... I don't know what to say.

16:30.489 --> 16:32.293
I'm the one who needs
to say something.

16:32.327 --> 16:33.563
Thank you.

16:33.597 --> 16:36.335
Dr. Berger made
all the difference.

16:36.368 --> 16:38.472
Even Norma's impressed.
She didn't try

16:38.507 --> 16:40.777
‐to school me once today.
‐Now, that's a miracle.

16:40.811 --> 16:42.347
‐(laughs)
‐(Aaron cries softly)

16:42.380 --> 16:44.719
‐Um...
‐Don't worry.

16:44.752 --> 16:46.321
I got this. Go on.

16:46.355 --> 16:48.192
‐Okay.
‐Break a leg.

16:48.225 --> 16:50.731
Thank you. Mmm.

16:52.300 --> 16:54.605
‐I love you.
‐I love you.

16:56.509 --> 16:58.145
(crying)

16:58.178 --> 17:00.416
You got this, Liv. (laughs)

17:00.449 --> 17:03.188
‐(crying loudly)
‐(lullaby playing on toy)

17:05.426 --> 17:07.498
Shh. Shh.

17:07.531 --> 17:10.637
(lullaby distorting)

17:10.671 --> 17:12.440
(eerie whooshing)

17:14.545 --> 17:18.052
(eerie whispering)

17:21.826 --> 17:23.496
How did you get here?

17:23.530 --> 17:26.603
And why do you look different?

17:32.815 --> 17:34.652
Did you put this
in Aaron's crib?

17:34.685 --> 17:36.789
Why do you have something
like that?

17:36.823 --> 17:40.296
That's my business, Norma.
I just need to know.

17:40.329 --> 17:42.768
(speaking Spanish)

17:42.801 --> 17:44.538
(growling)

17:44.572 --> 17:46.441
‐I can't work here.
‐Where are you going?

17:46.475 --> 17:48.747
(speaks Spanish)

17:50.884 --> 17:52.487
Norma!

17:53.590 --> 17:55.694
(door closes)

17:55.727 --> 17:57.765
(low growling)

18:07.483 --> 18:09.822
(low growling)

18:09.855 --> 18:13.162
(door opens,
light switch clicks)

18:25.621 --> 18:28.359
(metallic creaking)

18:28.392 --> 18:31.599
(hissing,
metallic creaking)

18:33.903 --> 18:35.907
(rhythmic metallic knocking)

18:35.941 --> 18:39.180
(metallic scraping)

18:43.355 --> 18:45.594
(metallic creaking)

18:48.332 --> 18:51.706
(eerie voices chanting)

19:03.563 --> 19:04.598
(screeches)

19:07.370 --> 19:10.644
(panting)

19:10.677 --> 19:12.246
(gasps)

19:12.280 --> 19:15.219
I don't blame Norma
for leaving. I mean,

19:15.252 --> 19:17.256
I wouldn't want to be around
one of these, either.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.227
It looks fucking satanic.

19:19.260 --> 19:21.365
It didn't look like that
when I got it.

19:22.367 --> 19:25.272
I... I‐I don't even know
what to say to that.

19:25.306 --> 19:28.479
I mean, what are you saying‐‐
that it's‐it's changing?

19:28.513 --> 19:31.485
Where'd you get that, anyways?

19:31.519 --> 19:33.890
Just some new age store.

19:33.923 --> 19:36.829
It's just like a talisman,
good luck thing.

19:36.863 --> 19:38.833
It's no big deal.

19:38.867 --> 19:42.908
I just... want to know how
it ended up in Aaron's crib.

19:42.941 --> 19:44.912
Well, I‐I sure as hell
didn't put it there.

19:44.945 --> 19:46.783
I'm not saying you did.

19:46.816 --> 19:49.287
Then what about the basement?

19:49.320 --> 19:53.362
I told you. It seems like a
raccoon got trapped down there.

19:53.395 --> 19:55.901
Those claw marks were huge.

19:55.934 --> 19:58.773
I mean, babe, what are you
actually saying here?

19:58.807 --> 20:01.244
That we have, what, a‐a ghost?

20:01.278 --> 20:02.681
I mean, come on.

20:02.715 --> 20:04.752
I don't know.

20:05.721 --> 20:08.860
Personally, I'm a little
weirded out that you think

20:08.893 --> 20:12.400
this ugly‐ass thing is
responsible for our baby.

20:12.433 --> 20:13.937
And I am very weirded out

20:13.970 --> 20:16.776
that I've had
to sleep over it all this time.

20:17.978 --> 20:20.015
But...

20:20.049 --> 20:22.554
what I think
is actually happening is

20:22.588 --> 20:24.859
that you're just
very, very tired,

20:24.892 --> 20:27.865
and your imagination's
in‐in overdrive.

20:27.898 --> 20:30.670
I... I thought
you were feeling better.

20:30.704 --> 20:32.306
I thought
Berger made a difference.

20:32.340 --> 20:35.580
‐She did.
‐Doesn't sound like it.

20:35.614 --> 20:37.818
I mean, look at you.

20:37.851 --> 20:39.989
I'm getting worried, baby.

20:40.022 --> 20:43.462
(sniffles)
You don't need to be.

20:46.468 --> 20:48.706
Liv...

20:48.740 --> 20:50.710
NCIS wants me back, okay?

20:50.744 --> 20:54.017
There's this flashback episode
for my character.

20:54.050 --> 20:58.325
You know, an actual part,
not just a stand‐in with lines.

20:58.358 --> 21:00.730
And I'll be in scenes
with real actors.

21:00.764 --> 21:02.501
That's great, honey.

21:02.534 --> 21:04.505
Yeah, but we're shooting nights,

21:04.538 --> 21:06.609
and I cannot do it
if you're gonna be freaking out

21:06.642 --> 21:10.449
over raccoons
and weird fucking statues.

21:12.487 --> 21:15.994
Please let me know that we're
not going backwards, all right?

21:16.027 --> 21:18.800
You got to give me a reason
not to worry, please.

21:18.833 --> 21:21.071
I'm okay.

21:21.104 --> 21:23.910
Really.

21:42.948 --> 21:45.419
(gasps)

21:45.452 --> 21:49.728
‐(gasping)
‐(Aaron babbling)

21:59.548 --> 22:03.055
(loud static, whooshing)

22:05.392 --> 22:07.396
(static continues)

22:13.543 --> 22:15.614
(Aaron cries softly)

22:21.759 --> 22:23.963
Oh.

22:55.192 --> 22:58.733
(high‐pitched static)

22:58.766 --> 23:02.574
EERIE MALE VOICE:
I...

23:02.608 --> 23:04.912
(device chirps softly)

23:04.945 --> 23:07.918
(eerie whooshing on monitor)

23:07.951 --> 23:10.890
It's static. It's‐it's like
there's interference

23:10.924 --> 23:13.696
‐or something.
‐That's what I thought at first,

23:13.730 --> 23:15.600
but then I tried something.

23:15.634 --> 23:18.005
(static whirring)

23:18.038 --> 23:21.011
Baby... how long
have you been up

23:21.044 --> 23:22.514
messing around with this?
You were supposed

23:22.547 --> 23:23.850
to be getting some sleep.

23:23.883 --> 23:25.152
Just listen.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.593
This is it sped up five times.

23:28.626 --> 23:32.701
(static)

23:34.070 --> 23:35.907
Hear that?

23:35.941 --> 23:40.049
Listen. Just listen, Matt.
Please.

23:41.652 --> 23:43.790
(static)

23:43.823 --> 23:49.568
(repeating after recording):
"I"... "want"... "him."

23:50.637 --> 23:53.041
"I want him."

23:54.645 --> 23:57.149
(crying):
"I want him."

23:57.183 --> 23:58.886
Don't tell me
those aren't words!

23:58.920 --> 24:03.896
I‐I don't know
what I'm hearing, okay?

24:03.930 --> 24:07.036
I got to try
and get this clearer.

24:08.873 --> 24:10.910
EERIE MALE VOICE:
I...

24:10.944 --> 24:14.050
‐Fuck!
‐...want ...him.

24:14.083 --> 24:17.557
(shuddering breaths)

24:31.552 --> 24:33.923
(static)

24:44.110 --> 24:46.081
Please don't be mad.

24:46.114 --> 24:47.784
I asked her to come over.

24:49.588 --> 24:51.892
Hi, Liv.

24:58.105 --> 25:00.510
Let me listen.

25:05.987 --> 25:09.628
(static)

25:17.043 --> 25:19.882
(quietly):
Just‐just listen again, please.

25:19.915 --> 25:22.019
I don't have to.

25:22.053 --> 25:24.892
I know what isn't there.

25:24.925 --> 25:26.996
‐But it's so clear.
‐Liv,

25:27.029 --> 25:30.970
the human brain has evolved
to find connections.

25:31.004 --> 25:33.241
‐No.
‐Yeah.

25:33.275 --> 25:34.812
"Pareidolia" is what
it's called.

25:34.845 --> 25:39.588
When the mind sees
patterns and faces

25:39.621 --> 25:43.095
in nature, like faces on Mars,

25:43.128 --> 25:46.635
or the Virgin Mary
in a piece of burnt toast.

25:46.669 --> 25:48.873
And there are also
auditory pareidolia,

25:48.906 --> 25:50.877
like when fans hear, "Paul is

25:50.910 --> 25:53.583
a dead man"
in one of the Beatles' songs.

25:53.616 --> 25:56.889
‐So I'm delusional.
‐No. You're human.

25:56.922 --> 25:59.093
You're human.

25:59.127 --> 26:03.168
Your hormones are
on a roller‐coaster ride.

26:03.201 --> 26:06.141
You're stressed out
and sleep‐deprived.

26:06.174 --> 26:09.180
Very few people understand
just how debilitating

26:09.213 --> 26:11.184
the lack of sleep can be.

26:11.217 --> 26:13.188
I don't think
this is about my lack of sleep.

26:13.221 --> 26:16.027
It's exactly
what this is about.

26:16.060 --> 26:18.331
You're not thinking clearly.

26:18.365 --> 26:23.308
The sooner you accept that,
the sooner we can move forward.

26:25.713 --> 26:29.153
I'm prescribing Zoloft,

26:29.187 --> 26:32.026
50 milligrams per day.

27:01.251 --> 27:03.288
(shallow breathing)

27:10.335 --> 27:12.941
RORY:
To Matt‐‐ the first one
of us to make it.

27:12.974 --> 27:14.343
‐Yay.
‐(cheering)

27:14.377 --> 27:15.947
Proud of you, buddy.

27:15.980 --> 27:17.684
All right, that's,
like, the ninth toast.

27:17.717 --> 27:19.353
I think you're just using me
as an excuse to drink.

27:19.387 --> 27:21.792
Ah, just kissing your butt, man,

27:21.826 --> 27:22.961
so you don't forget
about your old college buddies

27:22.994 --> 27:24.197
‐from the film department.
‐Mm.

27:24.230 --> 27:25.834
‐Yeah.
‐Just remember.

27:25.867 --> 27:27.871
The world needs tall,
geek character actors.

27:27.904 --> 27:29.340
And great set decs.

27:29.373 --> 27:31.411
Or editors/sound designers

27:31.444 --> 27:33.983
with their own equipment, hmm?

27:34.016 --> 27:35.854
All right, I think you guys
are getting carried away.

27:35.887 --> 27:37.991
It's only seven lines.

27:38.024 --> 27:40.395
‐All right?
‐Oh, that's it?
‐Oh, wow.

27:40.429 --> 27:42.801
Haven't seen one of these
since I was a kid.

27:42.834 --> 27:44.972
You find this in a flea market?

27:45.005 --> 27:46.976
MATT:
Oh, yeah.
We used to love game nights.

27:48.411 --> 27:50.717
EMMA:
I always wanted to try one,

27:50.750 --> 27:53.121
‐and tonight's
the perfect night for it.
‐Yeah.

27:53.154 --> 27:55.125
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

27:55.158 --> 27:58.231
‐Maybe another time.
‐No. Matt, it's okay.

28:01.304 --> 28:03.843
(sighing)

28:03.876 --> 28:05.880
EMMA:
We call on the spirits.

28:05.914 --> 28:08.719
Speak to us...

28:08.753 --> 28:10.055
we beseech you.

28:10.088 --> 28:11.224
(snorts)

28:13.295 --> 28:15.165
If anyone is there,

28:15.199 --> 28:18.973
please communicate with us.

28:20.209 --> 28:22.146
‐Beseech.
‐(muffled chuckle)

28:22.179 --> 28:24.718
Shut up and focus.

28:25.920 --> 28:27.156
Give us a sign.

28:27.189 --> 28:29.260
MATT:
We've played this
a million times.

33:07.482 --> 33:09.486
I don't understand.

33:09.521 --> 33:11.792
It's Ba'al. It's a demon,

33:11.825 --> 33:16.200
and you're going to tell me
how to get rid of it.

33:16.234 --> 33:18.271
BERNADETTE:
It doesn't make any sense.

33:18.304 --> 33:21.310
Ba'al is fertility god.
He isn't a demon.

33:21.344 --> 33:23.582
Well, he's sure as hell
acting like one.

33:23.616 --> 33:26.320
One of these contains
a banishment ritual,

33:26.354 --> 33:28.491

‐Grim what?

33:28.526 --> 33:31.397
Grimoires. They're compendiums
of black magic.

33:31.430 --> 33:34.704
I only have them
for historical reasons.

33:34.738 --> 33:36.642
They were all written
by old white men

33:36.675 --> 33:38.712
who bought into the whole
anti‐pagan demonic thing.

It's all church branding,
fairy tale stuff, Hollywood.

33:46.260 --> 33:50.035
Well, maybe you don't know
as much about it as you think.

33:50.068 --> 33:52.172
My parents dabbled
in the sacred arts,

33:52.206 --> 33:54.376
but I have been hardcore
into magic since high school.

33:54.410 --> 33:56.280
Magic‐‐ it saved my life.

I was on drugs,
abusing my body, but paganism‐‐

33:58.586 --> 34:01.123
it opened up
a whole new world for me,

34:01.157 --> 34:03.696
a new universe
that turned everything around.
