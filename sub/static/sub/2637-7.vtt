WEBVTT

00:01.718 --> 00:04.209
Watch this, it's really cool. Ahem.

00:04.387 --> 00:06.446
Call Leonard Hofstadter.

00:06.623 --> 00:10.559
<i>Did you say, "Call Helen Boxleitner"?</i>

00:12.462 --> 00:16.421
No. Call Leonard Hofstadter.

00:16.599 --> 00:20.296
<i>Did you say, "Call Temple Beth Seder"?</i>

00:21.538 --> 00:23.870
- No.
- Here, let me try.

00:24.541 --> 00:28.637
Call M' kflono M' kflooniloo. Ha-ha. Ha.

00:29.312 --> 00:31.439
<i>Calling Rajesh Koothrappali.</i>

00:37.454 --> 00:40.252
Oh. It's very impressive.

00:40.890 --> 00:42.619
And a little racist.

00:43.727 --> 00:46.195
If we're through playing
Mock the Flawed Technology...

00:46.362 --> 00:47.886
...can we get on with "Halo" night?

00:48.064 --> 00:50.157
We were supposed to start at 8.
It's now 8:06.

00:50.333 --> 00:51.732
So we'll start now.

00:51.901 --> 00:53.994
We have to decide
if those lost six minutes...

00:54.170 --> 00:57.105
...will come out of game time,
bathroom time or the pizza break.

00:57.273 --> 00:59.036
We could split it two, two and two.

00:59.209 --> 01:02.269
If we're having anchovies on the pizza,
we can't take it out of bathroom time.

01:03.613 --> 01:05.513
What fresh hell is this?

01:06.316 --> 01:08.477
- Hey, Penny. Come on in.
- Hey, guys.

01:08.651 --> 01:13.111
See a Penny, pick her up,
and all the day, you'll have good luck.

01:15.425 --> 01:17.518
No, you won't. Uh...

01:17.694 --> 01:20.527
- Can I hide out here for a while?
- Sure. What's going on?

01:20.697 --> 01:23.564
Well, there's this girl I know
from back in Nebraska, Christy.

01:23.733 --> 01:26.258
She called me up,
she's like, "Hey, how's California? "

01:26.436 --> 01:28.768
And I'm like, "Awesome,"
because it's not Nebraska.

01:28.972 --> 01:31.839
The next thing I know,
she's invited herself to stay with me.

01:32.008 --> 01:34.704
-8:08.
- Shh.

01:35.445 --> 01:38.073
She got here today
and she's just been in my apartment...

01:38.248 --> 01:42.344
...yakking about every guy she slept with
in Omaha, which is every guy in Omaha...

01:42.519 --> 01:45.044
...and washing
the sluttiest collection of underwear...

01:45.221 --> 01:47.121
...you have ever seen
in my bathroom sink.

01:47.290 --> 01:50.555
Is she doing it one thong at a time
or does she throw it all in?

01:50.727 --> 01:53.457
Like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse?

01:55.031 --> 01:57.556
- He really needs to dial it down.
- I know.

01:59.102 --> 02:02.037
So if you don't like this Christy,
why are you letting her stay?

02:02.205 --> 02:05.072
She was engaged to my cousin
while sleeping with my brother...

02:05.241 --> 02:06.538
...so she's kind of family.

02:08.011 --> 02:10.309
Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst.

02:10.479 --> 02:12.380
Who needs "Halo"
when we can be regaled...

02:12.549 --> 02:15.575
...with the delightfully folksy tale
of the whore of Omaha?

02:16.619 --> 02:18.587
Oh... I don't think she's a whore.

02:18.755 --> 02:20.382
No, yeah, she's definitely a whore.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.957
I mean, she has absolutely no standards.

02:23.126 --> 02:25.390
This one time, she was at...

02:25.562 --> 02:26.722
Where's Howard?

02:26.896 --> 02:28.124
Bonjour, mademoiselle.

02:28.298 --> 02:30.095
I understand you're new in town.

02:31.634 --> 02:32.931
Oh, good grief.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:03.132 --> 03:08.001
Ugh. I cannot believe Christy let Howard
into my apartment.

03:08.404 --> 03:10.668
And I cannot believe people pay
for horoscopes...

03:10.840 --> 03:15.174
...but on a more serious note,
it's 8:13 and we're still not playing "Halo. "

03:15.345 --> 03:18.246
Okay, fine. We'll just play one-on-one
until he gets back.

03:18.414 --> 03:20.143
One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one.

03:20.316 --> 03:24.116
We play teams, not one-on-one.
One-on-one.

03:24.587 --> 03:28.751
Well, the only way we can play teams
at this point is if we cut Raj in half.

03:29.025 --> 03:32.984
Sure, cut the foreigner in half.
There's a billion more where he came from.

03:33.363 --> 03:35.422
Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I'll play.

03:35.598 --> 03:38.123
- Great idea.
- Uh, no.

03:39.168 --> 03:43.229
The wheel was a great idea.
Relativity was a great idea.

03:43.406 --> 03:46.307
This is a notion,
and a rather sucky one at that.

03:47.176 --> 03:49.201
- Why?
- Why? Oh...

03:49.379 --> 03:52.815
- Penny, Penny, Penny.
- What, what, what?

03:52.982 --> 03:56.145
This is a complex battle simulation
with a steep learning curve.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.719
There are myriad weapons,
vehicles and strategies to master...

03:58.888 --> 04:00.913
...not to mention
an extremely intricate back-story.

04:02.292 --> 04:05.557
Cool! Whose head did I just blow off?

04:06.195 --> 04:07.219
Mine.

04:08.398 --> 04:11.561
Okay, I got this. Lock and load, boys.

04:12.168 --> 04:14.193
It's the only way we can play teams.

04:14.370 --> 04:17.805
But whoever's her partner will be hamstrung
by her lack of experience, not to mention-

04:19.175 --> 04:20.971
Ha-ha! There goes your head again.

04:21.611 --> 04:25.069
Okay, it's not good sportsmanship
to shoot somebody who's just re-spawned.

04:25.248 --> 04:27.148
You need to give them a chance to-
Now, come on.

04:28.651 --> 04:30.551
Raj, Raj, she's got me cornered.
Cover me.

04:30.720 --> 04:32.847
Cover this, suckers.

04:34.223 --> 04:35.315
Penny, you are on fire.

04:35.491 --> 04:37.584
Yeah, and so is Sheldon.

04:39.462 --> 04:42.226
Okay, that's it.
I don't know how, but she is cheating.

04:42.398 --> 04:45.993
No one can be that attractive
and this skilled at a video game.

04:46.169 --> 04:48.364
Wait, Sheldon, come back.
You forgot something.

04:48.538 --> 04:49.596
What?

04:49.772 --> 04:51.501
This plasma grenade.

04:53.910 --> 04:56.344
Ha! Look, it's raining you.

04:57.580 --> 05:01.016
You laugh now,
you just wait until you need tech support.

05:02.685 --> 05:04.983
Gosh. He's kind of a sore loser, isn't he?

05:05.154 --> 05:08.612
Well, to be fair,
he's also a rather unpleasant winner.

05:08.791 --> 05:10.656
Well, it's been fun.

05:10.827 --> 05:12.590
Penny, we make such a good team.

05:12.762 --> 05:15.560
Maybe we could enter
a couple of "Halo" tournaments sometime.

05:16.099 --> 05:18.533
Or we could just have a life.

05:19.602 --> 05:22.196
I guess for you, that's an option.
Ha-ha. Ha.

05:22.638 --> 05:24.162
- Good night, Leonard.
- Good night.

05:24.340 --> 05:26.831
As usual, nice talking to you, Raj.

05:28.211 --> 05:30.270
What do you suppose she meant by that?

05:31.280 --> 05:32.907
She's an enigma, Raj.

05:33.716 --> 05:36.651
There's a certain ethic to the game,
Penny, a well-established-

05:36.819 --> 05:39.344
- She's gone, Sheldon.
- Oh.

05:39.522 --> 05:41.387
Well, she could have said goodbye.

05:42.458 --> 05:44.619
Okay, I have a problem.

05:44.794 --> 05:48.059
It's called carpal tunnel syndrome,
and quite frankly, you deserve it.

05:49.766 --> 05:50.790
What's wrong?

05:50.967 --> 05:56.769
Well, um, Howard and Christy
are kind of hooking up in my bedroom.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.299
- Are you sure?
- Look, I grew up on a farm, okay?

06:00.476 --> 06:04.412
From what I heard, they're either having sex
or Howard's caught in a milking machine.

06:07.216 --> 06:08.911
Do you mind if I stay here tonight?

06:09.085 --> 06:12.282
No. Yeah, take the couch, or my bed.
I just got new pillows.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.719
Hypoallergenic.

06:15.258 --> 06:16.589
Uh, the couch is good.

06:16.759 --> 06:19.023
Hold that thought. Leonard, a moment.

06:23.132 --> 06:24.599
You have a problem with this.

06:24.767 --> 06:25.791
Where do I begin?

06:25.968 --> 06:28.801
It's up to you. Crazy person's choice.

06:28.971 --> 06:31.303
Well, first, we don't have house guests.

06:31.474 --> 06:34.500
Frankly, if I could afford the rent,
I'd ask you to leave.

06:35.278 --> 06:37.940
Your friendship means a lot
to me as well. What else?

06:38.514 --> 06:40.778
Well, our earthquake supplies.

06:40.950 --> 06:43.350
- We have a two-man, two-day kit.
- So?

06:43.519 --> 06:46.784
So if there's an earthquake
and the three of us are trapped here...

06:46.956 --> 06:49.948
...we could be out of food
by tomorrow afternoon.

06:50.693 --> 06:52.820
Are you suggesting
that if we let Penny stay...

06:52.995 --> 06:55.122
...we might succumb to cannibalism?

06:55.298 --> 06:58.165
No one ever thinks it'll happen
until it does.

06:59.469 --> 07:04.304
Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh
off our bones while we sleep, you can stay.

07:04.740 --> 07:09.575
- Ha. What?
- He's engaging in reductio ad absurdum.

07:10.446 --> 07:14.007
It's the fallacy of extending someone's
argument to ridiculous proportions...

07:14.183 --> 07:17.277
...and then criticizing the result.
And I don't appreciate it.

07:18.154 --> 07:20.520
I'll get you a blanket and a pillow.

07:20.823 --> 07:25.157
Okay, since I'm obviously being ignored
here, let's go over the morning schedule.

07:25.328 --> 07:27.853
I use the bathroom from 7 to 7:20.

07:28.030 --> 07:30.498
Plan your ablutions
and bodily functions accordingly.

07:32.001 --> 07:34.265
How am I supposed to
plan my bodily functions?

07:34.437 --> 07:36.701
I suggest no liquids after 11 p. m.

07:37.673 --> 07:40.369
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Leonard.

07:41.410 --> 07:43.503
Hm-hm. Wrong.

07:46.349 --> 07:47.373
I'm listening.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.518
Your head goes on the other end.

07:49.685 --> 07:51.676
- Why?
- It's culturally universal.

07:51.854 --> 07:53.617
A bed, even a temporary bed...

07:53.789 --> 07:56.553
...is always oriented with the headboard
away from the door.

07:56.726 --> 08:01.493
It serves the ancient imperative
of protecting oneself against marauders.

08:04.534 --> 08:06.331
- I'll risk it.
- Ooh.

08:06.502 --> 08:07.867
Anything else I should know?

08:08.037 --> 08:11.973
Yes. If you use my toothbrush,
I'll jump out that window.

08:13.476 --> 08:16.343
Please don't come to my funeral.
Have a good night.

08:18.881 --> 08:20.974
- Sorry about that.
- That's okay.

08:21.150 --> 08:25.553
FYl, his toothbrush is the red one
in the Plexiglas case under the UV light.

08:25.721 --> 08:29.122
- Ha. Got it.
- Well, sleep tight.

08:29.292 --> 08:31.089
Thanks.

08:33.828 --> 08:36.855
Funny expression, sleep tight. Ha-ha. Ha.

08:38.267 --> 08:40.428
It refers to
the early construction of beds...

08:40.602 --> 08:44.403
...which featured a mattress suspended
on interlocking ropes, which occasionally-

08:45.141 --> 08:47.109
Sleep tight.

10:01.884 --> 10:03.181
What are you doing?

10:06.689 --> 10:10.250
Every Saturday since we've lived in
this apartment I have awakened at 6:15...

10:10.426 --> 10:13.088
...poured a bowl of cereal,
added a quarter cup of milk...

10:13.262 --> 10:17.995
...sat on this end of this couch, turned on
BBC America, and watched Doctor Who.

10:18.801 --> 10:19.859
Penny's still sleeping.

10:21.504 --> 10:23.938
Every Saturday
since we've lived in this apartment...

10:24.106 --> 10:26.074
...I have awakened at 6:15,
poured myself-

10:26.242 --> 10:28.369
I know.
Look, you have a TV in your room.

10:28.544 --> 10:30.205
Why don't you have breakfast in bed?

10:30.613 --> 10:34.413
Because I am neither an invalid
nor a woman celebrating Mother's Day.

10:36.352 --> 10:37.580
What time is it?

10:38.020 --> 10:39.544
Almost 6:30.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.690
I slept all day?

10:42.291 --> 10:44.122
No, it's 6:30 in the morning.

10:44.860 --> 10:47.294
What the hell is your problem?

10:48.464 --> 10:50.989
Okay, this cereal
has lost all its molecular integrity.

10:51.167 --> 10:54.000
I now have a bowl
of shredded wheat paste.

10:54.970 --> 10:57.632
Hola, nerd-migos.

10:59.975 --> 11:02.205
Why do you people hate sleep?

11:03.179 --> 11:04.942
Are you wearing my robe?

11:06.449 --> 11:08.576
Oh, yeah. Sorry, I'll have it cleaned.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.083
That's okay, keep it.

11:11.854 --> 11:14.288
- Where's Christy?
- In the shower.

11:14.557 --> 11:16.787
By the way,
where did you get that loofa mitt?

11:16.959 --> 11:19.553
Yours reaches places
that mine just won't.

11:23.733 --> 11:25.928
You used my loofa?

11:26.102 --> 11:28.502
More precisely, we used your loofa.

11:28.671 --> 11:31.299
I exfoliated her brains out.

11:33.476 --> 11:35.410
You can keep that too.

11:35.878 --> 11:40.076
Ah. Well, then, we'll probably need to talk
about your stuffed-bear collection.

11:41.484 --> 11:43.645
Howard?
- In here, milady.

11:44.887 --> 11:48.482
Mm. There's my little engine that could.

11:53.095 --> 11:55.996
There's one beloved children's book
I'll never read again.

11:56.599 --> 11:58.590
Hi. Christy.

11:58.768 --> 12:00.395
- Hey, Leonard.
- I'm Sheldon.

12:00.569 --> 12:02.764
Right. You're Howard's entourage.

12:05.274 --> 12:07.174
So, Christy, what are your plans?

12:07.343 --> 12:10.779
Well, Howard said he'd take me shopping
in Beverly Hills.

12:10.946 --> 12:14.643
Yeah, no, I meant plans to find
someplace to live other than with me.

12:14.817 --> 12:17.786
Not that I don't love having you,
but it's a little crowded.

12:17.953 --> 12:20.012
Penny, you're always welcome
to stay with us.

12:20.189 --> 12:23.249
Oh, terrific.
Now we're running a cute little B & B.

12:24.026 --> 12:25.857
Let me offer a little thinking here.

12:26.028 --> 12:29.156
- Why doesn't Christy stay with me?
- You live with your mother.

12:29.331 --> 12:31.993
I do not. My mother lives with me.

12:33.002 --> 12:36.699
It's settled. Christy will stay with Howard,
Penny can go back to her apartment.

12:36.872 --> 12:39.306
And I'll watch the last 24 minutes
of Doctor Who...

12:39.475 --> 12:42.535
...although at this point,
it's more like Doctor Why Bother.

12:43.679 --> 12:47.240
- Sheldon, you just can't dictate-
- No more talking. Everybody go.

12:48.250 --> 12:51.845
So, what do you say?
Wanna repair to Casa Wolowitz?

12:52.021 --> 12:54.546
What is that, like a Mexican deli?

12:54.723 --> 12:56.918
I'm sorry,
I should have mentioned this earlier.

12:57.092 --> 12:58.821
My last name is Wolowitz.

12:58.994 --> 13:01.554
Oh. That's so cool.

13:01.730 --> 13:04.130
My first Jew.

13:07.236 --> 13:10.672
I imagine there aren't
very many kosher cornhuskers.

13:13.008 --> 13:15.704
- But you're still taking me shopping?
- Anything you want.

13:15.878 --> 13:18.210
Okay, I'll go pack my stuff.

13:20.783 --> 13:24.344
When they perfect human cloning,
I'm gonna order 12 of those.

13:26.388 --> 13:28.185
Howard, can't you see she's using you?

13:28.357 --> 13:31.622
Who cares? Last night,
she pulled off her blouse and I wept.

13:31.794 --> 13:33.455
Look, Howard, I know her, okay?

13:33.629 --> 13:37.065
She'll have sex with anyone
as long as they keep buying her things.

13:37.466 --> 13:38.933
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:39.101 --> 13:40.466
Yay.

13:43.038 --> 13:47.566
If you'll excuse me,
I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.

13:55.518 --> 13:58.419
I'm sorry,
we cannot do this without Wolowitz.

13:58.587 --> 14:01.522
We can't order Chinese food
without Wolowitz?

14:01.690 --> 14:02.952
Let me walk you through it.

14:03.125 --> 14:05.821
Our standard order is,
the steamed dumpling appetizer...

14:05.995 --> 14:08.122
...General Tso's chicken,
beef with broccoli...

14:08.297 --> 14:10.697
...shrimp with lobster sauce,
and vegetable lo mein.

14:10.866 --> 14:12.766
Do you see the problem?

14:14.236 --> 14:16.204
I see a problem.

14:16.372 --> 14:19.967
Our entire order is predicated
on four dumplings and four entrées...

14:20.142 --> 14:22.633
...divided amongst four people.

14:24.480 --> 14:26.641
So we'll just order three entrées.

14:26.815 --> 14:28.407
Fine. What do you wanna eliminate?

14:28.584 --> 14:31.485
- And who gets the extra dumpling?
- We could cut it into thirds.

14:31.654 --> 14:33.121
Then it's no longer a dumpling.

14:33.289 --> 14:37.089
Once you cut it open, it is, at best,
a very small open-faced sandwich.

14:37.560 --> 14:38.822
Hi, fellas.

14:38.994 --> 14:43.624
Oh. Where's your annoying little friend
who thinks he speaks Mandarin?

14:43.799 --> 14:46.199
He's putting his needs
ahead of the collective good.

14:46.368 --> 14:48.768
Where he comes from,
that's punishable by death.

14:49.405 --> 14:52.135
I come from Sacramento.

14:55.544 --> 14:58.479
Can we get an order of dumplings,
but with three instead of four?

14:58.647 --> 15:00.171
No substitutions.

15:00.349 --> 15:02.749
This isn't a substitution.
It's a reduction.

15:02.918 --> 15:05.318
Okay. No reductions.

15:06.088 --> 15:08.556
Fine. Bring us three orders of dumplings.

15:08.724 --> 15:11.192
- That's 12, we'll each have four.
- That works.

15:11.360 --> 15:13.851
No. Because we'll need
to eliminate another entrée.

15:14.029 --> 15:15.257
No eliminations.

15:16.665 --> 15:19.099
If we have extra,
we'll just take the leftovers home.

15:19.268 --> 15:22.863
And divide it how? I'm telling you,
we cannot do this without Wolowitz.

15:23.038 --> 15:24.505
Wolowitz is with his girlfriend.

15:24.673 --> 15:27.233
If you'd let me invite Penny,
you would've had a fourth.

15:27.409 --> 15:29.138
Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food?

15:29.311 --> 15:31.575
She uses a fork
and she double-dips her egg rolls.

15:32.114 --> 15:35.481
- We don't order egg rolls.
- Exactly. But we'd have to if she was here.

15:35.651 --> 15:37.118
Can we please make a decision?

15:37.286 --> 15:41.689
Not only are there children starving in India,
there's an Indian starving right here.

15:43.158 --> 15:45.388
There's an idea.
Why don't we go out for Indian food?

15:45.561 --> 15:47.188
Ecch.

15:47.730 --> 15:49.129
You're nice boys.

15:49.298 --> 15:52.563
Tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm gonna bring you the four dumplings.

15:52.735 --> 15:54.464
When I'm walking over to the table...

15:54.637 --> 15:57.504
...maybe I get bumped,
one of the dumplings fall to the floor.

15:57.673 --> 15:58.697
No one has to know.

16:00.542 --> 16:01.668
I'll know.

16:07.650 --> 16:10.141
- How about soup?
- Yeah, we can always divide soup.

16:10.319 --> 16:11.809
What about the won tons?

16:18.093 --> 16:19.822
Oh. Hey, guys, what's up?

16:19.995 --> 16:21.986
It's "Halo" night.

16:22.831 --> 16:24.230
Yeah? Okay.

16:25.968 --> 16:27.435
So?

16:27.936 --> 16:30.928
With Wolowitz spending all of his time
with your friend Christy-

16:31.106 --> 16:35.099
She's not my friend. Friends do not
get their friends' Care Bears all sweaty.

16:36.111 --> 16:39.911
Right, anyway, uh,
with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere...

16:40.082 --> 16:42.516
...we had something
we wanted to ask you.

16:42.685 --> 16:44.585
- Sheldon?
- Yes. Ahem.

16:47.389 --> 16:50.381
Penny,
we would very much appreciate it...

16:50.559 --> 16:53.187
...if you would be the fourth member
of our "Halo" team.

16:54.129 --> 16:58.031
I don't think I need to tell you
what an honor this is.

17:00.235 --> 17:01.600
Oh. That's so sweet.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.795
But I'm going out dancing
with a girlfriend.

17:03.972 --> 17:06.270
You can't go out, it's "Halo" night.

17:06.642 --> 17:08.803
Well, for Penny, it's dancing night.

17:08.977 --> 17:10.944
- You go dancing every Wednesday?
- No.

17:11.113 --> 17:12.410
Then it's not dancing night.

17:14.316 --> 17:15.907
Look, why don't we play tomorrow?

17:16.085 --> 17:19.542
Tonight is "Halo" night.
It's like talking to a wall.

17:20.489 --> 17:24.084
All right, now, Sheldon,
you and I are about to have a problem.

17:25.894 --> 17:27.987
Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.

17:28.163 --> 17:30.927
Yes, but you didn't portray her
as completely irrational.

17:31.433 --> 17:33.367
All right, fellas, I gotta go.

17:33.535 --> 17:35.628
But good luck.

17:38.340 --> 17:42.003
Maybe we should've asked if we could go
dancing with her and her girlfriend.

17:42.177 --> 17:44.372
Okay, assuming we could dance,
which we can't...

17:44.546 --> 17:46.446
...there are three of us and two of them.

17:46.615 --> 17:50.915
- So?
- It's the Chinese restaurant all over again.

17:51.086 --> 17:54.078
I assure you that cutting
a dumpling in thirds is child's play...

17:54.256 --> 17:58.488
...compared with three men each attempting
to dance with 67 percent of a woman.

17:59.661 --> 18:03.119
For God's sakes, Sheldon,
you are driving me crazy.

18:03.298 --> 18:05.630
Your anger is not with me,
but with mathematics.

18:05.801 --> 18:07.530
I'm pretty sure my anger is with you.

18:07.703 --> 18:10.399
What is happening to us?
We're falling apart.

18:12.141 --> 18:14.609
- Who are you calling?
- The only man who can restore...

18:14.777 --> 18:17.268
...any semblance of balance
to our universe.

18:17.446 --> 18:18.913
Hi, this is Howard Wolowitz.

18:19.081 --> 18:20.605
And this is Christy Vanderbelt.

18:20.783 --> 18:24.514
We can't get to the phone
right now because we're having sex.

18:26.622 --> 18:29.090
You're not gonna put
that on your message, are you?

18:29.258 --> 18:30.850
No, I'm just kidding. I'll re-record it.

18:34.797 --> 18:36.094
Sheldon, think this through.

18:36.265 --> 18:39.291
You're going to ask Howard
to choose between sex and " Halo. "

18:39.468 --> 18:43.131
No, I'm going to ask him
to choose between sex and "Halo 3."

18:43.605 --> 18:45.698
As far as I know,
sex has not been upgraded...

18:45.874 --> 18:49.037
...to include hi-def graphics
and enhanced weapon systems.

18:49.211 --> 18:52.840
You're right, all sex has is nudity,
orgasms and human contact.

18:53.315 --> 18:54.976
My point.

18:55.484 --> 18:59.181
I'm just saying you can take the
damn plastic off the couch once in a while.

18:59.354 --> 19:01.481
Why, so you
and Howard can hump on it?

19:03.358 --> 19:05.622
Ladies, ladies,
I'm sure there's a middle ground.

19:05.794 --> 19:08.058
- Shut up, Howard!
- Shut up, Howard!

19:08.797 --> 19:11.493
You guys talk.
I'll take my scooter out for a little spin.

19:11.667 --> 19:13.999
Are you happy?
You drove your son out of the house.

19:14.169 --> 19:15.796
Why don't you stop butting in?

19:15.971 --> 19:18.997
- What are you guys doing here?
- It's "Halo" night.

19:19.408 --> 19:23.674
He's not a man, he's a putz. And don't you
take that tone with me, you gold digger.

19:23.846 --> 19:25.507
- What did you call me?
- You heard me.

19:25.681 --> 19:28.343
And I'll tell you,
you're barking up the wrong tree.

19:28.517 --> 19:31.577
Because as long as you're around,
Howard is out of the will.

19:31.753 --> 19:34.984
You know what, I got better offers.
I'm out of here.

19:35.157 --> 19:38.991
That's right.
Go back to Babylon, you whore.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.425
So "Halo" night, huh?

19:46.335 --> 19:49.532
- I thought she was the whore of Omaha.
- Shh.

19:55.510 --> 19:58.946
Sheldon, you got him in your sights. Fire!
He's charging his plasma rifle.

19:59.114 --> 20:01.878
- I can't shoot now, I'm cloaking.
- Now, Raj, kill Sheldon.

20:02.050 --> 20:03.108
I can't see him.

20:03.285 --> 20:05.776
That's why they call it cloaking,
dead man.

20:05.954 --> 20:08.684
- Start throwing grenades.
- I'm all out.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.623
Hey, guys, my friends and I
got tired of dancing...

20:11.793 --> 20:14.023
...so we came over to have sex
with you.

20:14.196 --> 20:15.686
Now, Raj, jump in the tank.

20:15.864 --> 20:18.890
- We said no tanks.
- There are no rules in hell.

20:19.067 --> 20:22.264
Son of a bitch.
Med-pack! I need a med-pack!

20:23.972 --> 20:25.371
Told you.

20:25.540 --> 20:27.770
There's a sniper.
Use your rocket launcher.

20:27.943 --> 20:30.207
All I've got is a needler
and I'm all out of ammo!

20:30.379 --> 20:33.075
And now you're out of life.

20:34.683 --> 20:38.619
- Why did you hit pause?
- I thought I heard something.

20:38.787 --> 20:40.778
- What?
- No, it- Never mind.

20:40.956 --> 20:42.651
Sorry, go.
