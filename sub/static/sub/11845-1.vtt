It was buried among Tess's things.
It's a-

It's a letter Nasedo

16:04.494 --> 16:07.930
It says, “I am your one

16:07.998 --> 16:11.434
“I'll protect you

20:02.332 --> 20:04.858
That's only part of the reason.

The other part is that I don't want you

I know what it's like to be apart from you.

- Hisjob is to get a guilty plea.
- But he said that if we plead not guilty...

Jeff, if we plead guilty to a felony, then
there's a case against them in criminal court.
