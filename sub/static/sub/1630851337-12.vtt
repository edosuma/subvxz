most‐watched television show

Yeah!
Yeah!

00:36.203 --> 00:38.272
This is unbelievable.
Can we cut a chair?

00:38.272 --> 00:39.540
Alright.
Whoa!

00:39.540 --> 00:43.177
Coaches and band photo,

Thank you, everybody!
Yes! Let the knockouts continue!

Want another bite

00:48.482 --> 00:50.284
I'm all right.

00:50.284 --> 00:51.585
You don't want the finger?

Same old ‐‐

00:57.391 --> 00:59.359
It's been great. Yeah, man.
It's great to be here.

00:59.359 --> 01:01.695
I want to introduce you
to our next group.

01:01.695 --> 01:03.163
We've got BrittanyBree.

01:03.163 --> 01:04.831
She's from Louisiana
with a little bit of Texas.

♪ Why
Sing!

01:07.201 --> 01:09.136

01:11.805 --> 01:13.373

01:13.373 --> 01:15.576
Both of them have
really nice, textured voices,

01:15.576 --> 01:19.313
so raspy, tone, character.

01:19.313 --> 01:21.181
It's going to be tough
deciding between them.

01:21.181 --> 01:22.683
Cool.
Let's bring them out.

01:22.683 --> 01:25.419
Hello.
Hi! Look who's here!

01:25.419 --> 01:27.821
What?
Ed Sheeran is here.

01:27.821 --> 01:30.724
Hey, guys.
This is crazy. How you doing?

01:30.724 --> 01:32.226
I flipped out.
Wow!

01:32.226 --> 01:35.829
Ed Sheeran is
a massive inspiration to me.

01:35.829 --> 01:37.431
You guys enjoying
the process of it?

01:37.431 --> 01:39.800
Yes, it's a lot.
Oh, I love
your accent.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.169
It's beautiful.
Oh, thank you.

01:42.169 --> 01:43.804
Is this in the process
of being finished,

01:43.804 --> 01:45.172
or are you kind of
leaving it...?

01:45.172 --> 01:46.273
Okay.

01:46.273 --> 01:47.608
It's been
a couple years now,

01:47.608 --> 01:49.309
so I'm kind of leaving it
where it's at.

01:49.309 --> 01:51.211
I won't show you.
I've got my whole, you know...

01:51.211 --> 01:54.448
Oh, oh. We're about to get
a shirtless Ed Sheeran moment.

01:55.249 --> 01:57.451
So, BrittanyBree
is gonna to go first.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.186
I'm going to sing
"Best Part."

01:59.186 --> 02:01.288
By H. E. R. and Daniel Caesar?
Yes.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.290
So, what made you
want to do it?

02:03.290 --> 02:04.558
I just feel like
this is happening,

02:04.558 --> 02:06.460
so this is the best part
of my life.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.396
I never thought
that I would be on "The Voice."

02:10.631 --> 02:13.467
Having secular artists
turn around for me

02:13.467 --> 02:15.502
in a genre that I'm not even
comfortable in,

02:15.502 --> 02:17.304
it was, like ‐‐
it was mind‐blowing.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.673
♪ You're the best pa‐a‐art

02:19.673 --> 02:23.544
But this is actually the type
of music that I want to create.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.512
I want to create a bridge

02:25.512 --> 02:27.614
in between the gospel world
and secular world.

02:27.614 --> 02:29.149
♪ Whoa, hey

02:29.183 --> 02:32.219
♪ If you love me,
won't you say something ♪

02:32.252 --> 02:34.521
Your voice is magical.
I love it.
Thank you.

02:34.521 --> 02:38.392
My only comment to you
is adapting your style

02:38.392 --> 02:42.196
just a little bit
to be a little more tender

02:42.196 --> 02:43.430
and a little more
vulnerable.
Okay.

02:43.430 --> 02:46.200
Think about what you would say
kind of up close

02:46.200 --> 02:49.169
to somebody that you love,
and not to the rafters.

02:49.169 --> 02:54.241
Okay.
I think you've got a clear,
amazing vocal ability.

02:54.241 --> 02:55.809
I like the way you kind of
cut up your runs,

02:55.809 --> 02:58.178
but I think
smoothing them out,

02:58.178 --> 02:59.680
let them flow
a little bit more, okay?
Okay.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.516
It makes the times that
you really riff and go for it ‐‐

03:02.516 --> 03:04.585
it just makes them
so much more powerful.

03:04.585 --> 03:07.521
Not everybody gets to work
with Ed Sheeran. Come on.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.823
It was very exciting
to get his feedback.

03:09.823 --> 03:13.227
It was mind‐blowing.

03:13.227 --> 03:14.595
You've got a really wonderful
tone, as well.

03:14.595 --> 03:15.829
Really, really nice.
Thank you.

03:15.829 --> 03:18.165
Brittany was great.
I think her tone

03:18.165 --> 03:20.334
is something
that stands out.

03:20.334 --> 03:22.669
You know how you hear Rihanna
and you know it's Rihanna,

03:22.669 --> 03:25.205
or you hear Bieber,
you definitely know it's Bieber?

03:25.205 --> 03:27.407
Ariana, you know it's her?
I think that's what

03:27.407 --> 03:29.276
you're looking for
with vocal tone.

03:29.276 --> 03:32.079
So, I picked the song
"Bruises" by Lewis Capaldi.

03:32.079 --> 03:33.413
Okay.
I'm adopted, and so, like,

03:33.413 --> 03:35.449
the emotion behind the song
kind of connects

03:35.449 --> 03:37.384
with the proverbial "bruises"
that are left behind

03:37.384 --> 03:40.220
from feeling, you know,
those questions.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.788
I struggled with
a sense of self‐worth,

03:41.788 --> 03:45.492
so I reached out to my birth mom
in hopes to find some answers.

03:45.492 --> 03:48.529
Something that I found out
was how I came to be.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.464
It was nothing like
I had imagined,

03:50.464 --> 03:53.333
and to understand now
that my adoption was not

03:53.333 --> 03:56.136
a position of
"I don't want you,"

03:56.136 --> 03:57.571
it was out of sacrifice.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.306
"This is what
I need to do to give you

03:59.306 --> 04:02.543
the life that you deserve."
So, that was a big realization.

04:02.543 --> 04:05.045
♪ But I hope I never lose
the bruises ♪

04:05.078 --> 04:07.080
♪ That you left behind

04:07.080 --> 04:08.649
What I loved about
Samuel's voice

04:08.649 --> 04:10.551
was the rasp he gets.

04:10.551 --> 04:13.520
I love when people can get
a bit of grit behind it.

04:13.520 --> 04:14.621
♪ Hold ya

04:14.621 --> 04:18.759
I do feel that your connection
with this song is deeper

04:18.759 --> 04:20.360
than just you liking it.
Yeah.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.729
I love it when, in the chorus,
it goes gruff.

04:22.729 --> 04:25.532
Yeah.
And I think there's
tiny bits in the verses

04:25.532 --> 04:27.768
sometimes where you force it
just a little bit,

04:27.768 --> 04:29.303
but I think keep
the verses chilled,

04:29.303 --> 04:31.205
and then when it gets to
the chorus, it explodes.

04:31.205 --> 04:32.806
Yeah. That reward.
Yeah, I wouldn't give away

04:32.806 --> 04:34.675
your secret power yet.
Yeah.

04:34.675 --> 04:39.413
The question is, are you able
to deploy it selectively?

04:39.413 --> 04:42.716
It's inherently got, like,
pain built into it.

04:42.716 --> 04:45.385
It's got story
built into it.

04:45.385 --> 04:47.287
You want to emotionally connect
with the audience.
Yeah.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.189
It'll make them want
to snuggle up to your voice,

04:49.189 --> 04:50.290
you know what I'm saying,
a little more.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.725
And that's almost
more important

04:51.725 --> 04:53.360
than hitting all the notes,
sometimes.
Yeah.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.596
It's just not focusing on
getting everything exact.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.464
It's more about the feeling
and emotion behind it.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.700
That's huge,
coming from both of you.
Thank you.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.435
You're the reason I've gigged
for the last four years,

05:01.435 --> 05:03.136
and I wouldn't be here
without gigging.
Yeah.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.439
John definitely cut his teeth
like I cut my teeth,

05:05.439 --> 05:07.374
and luck is when preparation
meets opportunity.
Yeah.

05:07.374 --> 05:09.443
And when John's luck happened,
he was so prepared

05:09.443 --> 05:11.245
because he'd been gigging
every single day.

05:11.245 --> 05:13.247
But this is the preparation
to that point,

05:13.247 --> 05:15.182
so keep doing the gigs,
keep writing the songs,

05:15.182 --> 05:16.583
and yeah.
Thank you guys.

05:16.583 --> 05:19.620
With Samuel, I think it's
right up his alley style‐wise.

05:19.620 --> 05:22.589
As long as he executes it,
he's gonna do a beautiful job.

05:22.589 --> 05:25.492
For BrittanyBree, I just want
her to show that journey

05:25.492 --> 05:29.296
and make sure that every note
she sings is connected

05:29.296 --> 05:30.397
and it's for a purpose.

05:30.397 --> 05:32.466
This is gonna be
tough for me,

05:32.466 --> 05:36.336
but I just know how proud
I am of both of you

05:36.336 --> 05:37.704

you're gonna be.

05:37.704 --> 05:39.173

Thank you.

my favorite person that

10:52.960 --> 10:55.229
ever comes out on
the stage 'cause you
have your game face on.

and the band kind of dropped

physically, emotionally.

Man, Samuel.

11:05.806 --> 11:09.009
Way to pick a song
that you obviously can feel.

11:09.009 --> 11:13.881
To have someone telling a story
that you believe every word...

11:13.881 --> 11:15.149
Yeah, thank you.
...and I thought that
was really cool

11:15.149 --> 11:18.052
that you let all of us in,
and it was a beautiful job.

11:18.052 --> 11:19.920
Thank you very much.
Beautiful job.

11:19.920 --> 11:21.855
Kelly, I need help. Please.
I know, I know.

11:21.855 --> 11:23.190
This one's difficult.
I feel like

11:23.190 --> 11:25.926
Samuel maybe picked
the better competitive song.

11:25.926 --> 11:28.996
BrittanyBree brought it
to such a competitive level

11:28.996 --> 11:30.964
and, you know, aesthetically,
physically, all of that,

11:30.964 --> 11:33.534
and it made me really want
to hear her again.

11:33.534 --> 11:34.568
Okay.
So, maybe BrittanyBree.

11:34.568 --> 11:35.769
Thank you. Thank you.
Alright.

11:37.237 --> 11:40.574
BrittanyBree, I thought you
delivered a killer performance

11:40.574 --> 11:43.877
and did some
amazing things vocally.
Thank you.

11:43.877 --> 11:47.881
On the flip side, I feel like
Samuel just had a moment.

11:47.881 --> 11:49.183
You were
making me feel it

11:49.183 --> 11:50.784
and the rest of
the audience feel it,

11:50.784 --> 11:54.555
and I would be leaning
towards Samuel. Mm‐hmm.

11:54.555 --> 11:56.223
Thank you.

11:56.223 --> 11:59.293
BrittanyBree,
I was on the edge of my seat

11:59.293 --> 12:01.295
for that entire performance.

12:01.295 --> 12:02.997
It's so exciting
to listen to you

12:02.997 --> 12:05.199

where you're going to go.

12:05.199 --> 12:06.700
Thank you.

12:06.700 --> 12:08.535
Samuel,
your voice is so cool

12:08.535 --> 12:09.903
and has so many colors

12:09.903 --> 12:13.974
that are so specific
and sound so soulful,

12:13.974 --> 12:15.843
and there's so much texture
and grit.

12:15.843 --> 12:19.146
It sounds like your voice
has been through a lot,

12:19.146 --> 12:21.148
but you never lose control.
Thank you.

12:21.148 --> 12:25.052
I think in this space, I would
have to give it to Samuel.

12:25.052 --> 12:29.156
Thank you, coaches. Thank you.

12:29.156 --> 12:30.991
Alright, John,
it comes down to you, buddy.

12:30.991 --> 12:33.794

12:33.794 --> 12:34.995
Uh‐oh.
I don't know what to do

12:34.995 --> 12:37.665
because both of you
are so, so good.

12:37.665 --> 12:39.099
Samuel,
it just felt like

12:39.099 --> 12:41.869
you were thoroughly
connected to this song.

12:41.869 --> 12:43.804
I think that was the best
performance you've given

12:43.804 --> 12:45.272
on the show so far.
Thank you.

12:45.272 --> 12:49.243
BrittanyBree, you're just
one of the more gifted singers

12:49.243 --> 12:50.678

12:50.678 --> 12:52.513
I grew up on the music
you grew up on,

12:52.513 --> 12:55.149
so it hits
a special chord with me,

12:55.149 --> 12:58.919

a really great job. Thank you.

this knockout...

13:16.170 --> 13:20.741

13:22.543 --> 13:24.011

13:24.011 --> 13:26.880

and he has this authenticity

13:26.880 --> 13:29.116

connection to music

13:29.116 --> 13:30.784

let me remind you

13:40.961 --> 13:42.529
BrittanyBree is available
to steal.

13:42.529 --> 13:44.898
BrittanyBree, anything
you'd like to say to John?

13:44.898 --> 13:47.835
I have never sung secular music,
only gospel,

13:47.835 --> 13:50.104
so this is just
mind‐blowing for me.

13:50.104 --> 13:52.873
Great job.
Give it up one more time

20:09.445 --> 20:10.647
You can achieve anything.

20:10.647 --> 20:13.683

20:13.683 --> 20:15.785

I now have a career.

This is the cutest thing
I've ever seen,

25:33.566 --> 25:36.535
and I'll start with
The Cunningham Sisters.

25:36.535 --> 25:39.205
You guys have been
favorites of mine

25:39.205 --> 25:40.573
since you came onto
the show.

25:40.573 --> 25:42.341
I don't even know if you know
that or if you care,

25:42.341 --> 25:45.311
but you have been,
you have a lot about you,

25:45.311 --> 25:46.645
and it's really
incredible.

25:46.645 --> 25:49.315
Hailey, holy crap.
Like, wow.

25:49.315 --> 25:52.318
Y‐You really dug down deep
and you gave it

25:52.318 --> 25:55.488
a knockout‐worthy
performance. Thank you.

25:55.488 --> 25:57.656
I would give this knockout
to Hailey.

25:57.656 --> 26:00.559
The Cunningham Sisters,
it's always such a pleasure

26:00.559 --> 26:04.029
to hear your voices,
together, individually.

26:04.029 --> 26:05.531
Thank you.
Thank you.

26:05.531 --> 26:11.170
Hailey Mia,
oh, my God. What is happening?!

26:11.170 --> 26:15.207
That was so, so stunning
and so powerful.

26:15.207 --> 26:18.310
To see your growth ‐‐
I'm just astounded

26:18.310 --> 26:19.712
by what I just watched,

26:19.712 --> 26:22.381
and I'm obsessed
with the three of you.

26:24.083 --> 26:27.753
I love hearing The Cunningham
Sisters harmonize together.

26:27.753 --> 26:29.355
It's so nice.

26:29.355 --> 26:32.358
And, Hailey, having you
give the angst in the way

26:32.358 --> 26:35.094
that felt like you knew what
you were singing about ‐‐

26:35.094 --> 26:37.196
it was very compelling.

26:37.196 --> 26:39.598
Thank you, coaches.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.700
Alright, Kel,
it comes down to you.

26:41.700 --> 26:45.271
The Cunningham Sisters,
I love that you both have
incredibly different tones,

26:45.271 --> 26:48.073
but they blend
so magically together.

26:48.073 --> 26:51.677
Hearing this message of this
song from such young hearts,

26:51.677 --> 26:55.181
it's just such a beautiful,
pure thing.

26:55.181 --> 26:57.316
And, Hailey, you showed up
for rehearsal,

26:57.316 --> 27:00.586
and I was like,
"Wait, what?"

27:00.586 --> 27:03.622
Like, with a big,
huge voice.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.525
And you're all so gifted,
and you're so young,

27:06.525 --> 27:09.495
so you feel like such a jerk,
like, having to go,

27:09.495 --> 27:12.465
"Sorry, I picked the other one,"
you know? And so...

27:12.465 --> 27:14.700
Kelly, who is the winner
of this knockout?

27:14.700 --> 27:17.770
I just need y'all to know,
as a mama, this is so hard.

27:17.770 --> 27:20.473
I love when you take
your hair and hide.

27:20.473 --> 27:22.441
I just wanna
hide in it and run.

27:22.441 --> 27:25.177
I do that all the time.
I'm just stalling.

27:27.079 --> 27:29.215
But I've got to pick.

27:30.483 --> 27:32.751
The winner of this knockout
is Hailey.

27:32.751 --> 27:36.689
Hailey, congratulations!
Oh, my God!

27:36.689 --> 27:39.291
That knockout
was so hard for me,

27:39.291 --> 27:41.527
but Hailey, she just really
came alive.

27:41.527 --> 27:44.730
She's got rasp, kind of reminded
me of, like, The Cranberries.

27:44.730 --> 27:46.232
I had to go with Hailey.

27:46.232 --> 27:47.566
Coaches, let me remind you

27:47.566 --> 27:49.335
The Cunningham Sisters
are available to steal.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.470
Ladies, anything you'd like
to say to your coach?

27:51.470 --> 27:53.572
It's just been so awesome
to work with you, Kelly,

27:53.572 --> 27:55.274
and we just love you
so much.
Oh!

27:55.274 --> 27:57.309
Give it up one more time
for The Cunningham Sisters,

27:57.309 --> 27:58.677
ladies and gentlemen!

27:58.677 --> 28:00.513
The Cunningham Sisters
are great,

28:00.513 --> 28:03.315
but in the knockouts,
I only have one steal.

28:03.315 --> 28:06.385
I want someone to make me
feel that passion

28:06.385 --> 28:08.354
and feel like I need
to have them on my team.

28:08.354 --> 28:09.755
I'm just
so proud of her.

28:09.755 --> 28:11.724
You just gotta do it.
Like, she really
transformed.

28:11.724 --> 28:13.659
It was incredible.
I can't believe she's 13.

28:13.659 --> 28:14.660
I can't, either.

28:23.582 --> 28:25.906
Alright, so,
how is everyone feeling?

28:25.906 --> 28:28.298
I'm feeling good,
knockout‐wise.

28:28.298 --> 28:30.366
My team is good.
Wait, who has
a steal left?

28:30.366 --> 28:31.601
I do.
I do.

28:31.601 --> 28:32.869
I tried to use mine.
I used mine already.

28:32.869 --> 28:34.270
I tried and I tried,
but I failed.

28:34.270 --> 28:35.805
Oh, yeah, you ‐‐
What happened?

28:35.805 --> 28:37.307
Right, but you have
to congratulate me, though,

28:37.307 --> 28:38.775
because this is the one time
that has ever happened.

28:38.775 --> 28:41.811
I don't like it. I'm sorry.
It's making me unhappy.

28:41.811 --> 28:42.812
I don't like that.

28:42.812 --> 28:43.780
Oh.
Okay.

28:43.780 --> 28:45.014
Oh, I'm sorry.
Okay.

28:45.014 --> 28:46.750
We'll whip out
the emotional blackmail.

28:46.750 --> 28:48.685
Yes, yes.

28:48.685 --> 28:50.687
Do they have any idea?
About you?

28:50.687 --> 28:51.888
Yeah.
No.

28:51.888 --> 28:53.790
Cool.
They're gonna
be very excited.

28:53.790 --> 28:55.291
I mean, it would be

28:55.291 --> 28:56.693
a bit of an anticlimax
if they were like, "Ugh."

28:56.693 --> 28:57.994
I hope they don't
drop dead.

28:57.994 --> 28:59.763
Should I tell you
about my pairing?
Yeah.

28:59.763 --> 29:01.297
Ryleigh and David.

29:01.297 --> 29:03.733
David auditioned
with "Breathin," my song.

29:03.733 --> 29:07.871
He really likes to put his own
twist on female pop songs.
Cool.

29:07.871 --> 29:11.608
Ryleigh has this huge voice
with so much pop sensibility

29:11.608 --> 29:13.009
and so much soul.
I'm excited to see it.

29:13.009 --> 29:15.879
I'm excited, too.
Okay. should we bring them in?

Hey.
He's won Grammys.

29:24.687 --> 29:28.324

a couple years ago

29:51.614 --> 29:54.818

something about, I think,
the way that they sing

30:02.992 --> 30:04.828
and the way they write,
I connect with it

I have not heard that song
sung in that way.

30:30.019 --> 30:32.689

the fact it was open tuning

30:32.689 --> 30:35.859
had me geeking out for a second.
I am a fan.

was gorgeous.

and I think Ryleigh will be able

31:52.001 --> 31:55.305
to put her own spin on it
and it'll be great.

31:55.305 --> 31:57.574
♪ Loved by you

31:57.574 --> 31:58.942
Cool! Good stuff.

31:58.942 --> 32:00.744
You can sing!
Thank you.

32:00.744 --> 32:03.279
For me, I would love to
hear this half a step down,

32:03.279 --> 32:05.949
because I think when it gets
to the really high bits ‐‐

32:05.949 --> 32:07.751
I do this all the time
when I play live.

32:07.751 --> 32:09.052
Like, "Thinking Out Loud,"
I can't sing in

32:09.052 --> 32:10.787
its original key,
it's so high.
Yeah.

32:10.820 --> 32:11.955
So I just take it down
a half‐step...
Yeah.

32:11.955 --> 32:13.623
...and the confidence
of hitting those notes,

32:13.623 --> 32:15.959
there would be
no fear in that.

32:15.959 --> 32:17.560
It'd just be like,
"That's the note."
Yeah.

32:17.560 --> 32:18.928
Let's definitely try it.

32:18.928 --> 32:20.930
I don't want to lose
those low notes, though,

32:20.930 --> 32:23.266
'cause I know those notes are
low for you in the beginning.
Yeah, yeah.

32:23.266 --> 32:25.301
So when we try it a half down,
keep in mind,

32:25.301 --> 32:27.637
just giving support
from the front and the back.

32:27.637 --> 32:29.739
Mm‐hmm.

That was amazing.

Oh, my Lord.

38:17.787 --> 38:20.457
Look at what you all
did to her.

38:20.457 --> 38:23.359
You're putting her
through so much pain.

38:23.359 --> 38:24.427
Is it too late to quit?

38:25.995 --> 38:28.898
Ryleigh, you are
such a star.
Thank you.

38:28.898 --> 38:33.403
I just love the charisma
and the individuality

38:33.403 --> 38:34.838
you bring to everything
that you do.

38:34.838 --> 38:37.941
David, I think the choice that
set up the whole performance

38:37.941 --> 38:41.811
to be so great was you just
doing it acoustic on the guitar.

38:41.811 --> 38:44.981
It just allowed your voice
to inhabit this whole room.

38:44.981 --> 38:47.550
Thank you so much, man.
That means a lot.
So good.

38:47.550 --> 38:49.719
My daughter's
a big Selena Gomez fan,

38:49.719 --> 38:53.490
and I liked how cool
and different your version was.

38:53.490 --> 38:56.393
If I were picking
over all the rounds,

38:56.393 --> 38:57.761
I would pick Ryleigh,
but today,

38:57.761 --> 39:00.830
I would have picked David
just on that one performance.

39:00.830 --> 39:03.633
Super helpful.

39:03.633 --> 39:04.834
That's o‐‐
That's one way.

39:04.834 --> 39:07.604
I kind of understand why
she paired y'all.

39:07.604 --> 39:09.272
You are very different,
but you're both

39:09.272 --> 39:10.807
very free‐spirited.

39:10.807 --> 39:12.642
David, sometimes I feel
like, when people
bring out instruments,

39:12.642 --> 39:14.677
it kind of hinders
what they would do vocally,

39:14.677 --> 39:16.846
and it enhanced
what you do vocally,

39:16.846 --> 39:19.482
and I thought that was
really, really cool.

39:19.482 --> 39:20.817
Thank you so much.
Like, literally,

39:20.817 --> 39:22.452
you were, like, playing,
and you're like, "Hold on."

39:22.452 --> 39:24.421
And then you came back.
And I was like,

39:24.421 --> 39:26.556
"Alright, David."

39:26.556 --> 39:30.560
Ryleigh, vocally,
aesthetically, spirit‐wise,

39:30.560 --> 39:33.997
you're, like, one of the ‐‐
you know, a record label
is just like, "Done."

39:33.997 --> 39:35.965
Like, it's like you're,
like, a whole package.

39:35.965 --> 39:38.635
There's something so cool
about you for me.

39:38.635 --> 39:39.969
Even watching you while
you're sitting on a stool,

39:39.969 --> 39:41.704
"I wonder how she's gonna sit
on the stool."

39:41.704 --> 39:43.540
You're just cool.
That's star power.

39:43.540 --> 39:44.808
It, like, reminds me of
like Annie Lennox.

39:44.808 --> 39:46.543
So I'm leaning towards
Ryleigh,

39:46.543 --> 39:50.847
but David did
a really great job. Thank you.

39:50.847 --> 39:54.818
David, you're putting your stamp
all over that thing, man.

39:54.818 --> 39:56.953
I've never had
the confidence

39:56.953 --> 40:00.523
to fix my hair while playing
guitar at the same time, ever.

40:00.523 --> 40:01.724
It's like,
"Oh, my God" ‐‐

40:01.724 --> 40:02.859
It's a stunning feat.
Like, literally,

40:02.859 --> 40:05.528
there's sweat running
into my eyes, but I can't ‐‐ Ugh!

40:05.528 --> 40:06.663
Well, you had a mullet
for a while,

40:06.663 --> 40:08.331
so it was all
in the back.

40:08.331 --> 40:10.300
Well, I don't anymore...
He gave one of, like, those.

40:10.300 --> 40:11.935
...Kelly Clarkson.

40:11.935 --> 40:14.938
But then, Ryleigh,
I'm already drawn to you

40:14.938 --> 40:16.673
before you even started
singing.

40:16.673 --> 40:18.808
Then you started to perform,
and it's like,

40:18.808 --> 40:21.945
"Okay, there's a thing,
and it's obvious."

40:21.945 --> 40:25.415
I would go with Ryleigh.
Thank you, coaches.

40:25.415 --> 40:26.850
Alright, Ari,
it all comes down to you.

40:26.850 --> 40:30.520
Give us some thoughts.
What an honor
and privilege

40:30.520 --> 40:32.722
it's been to work with
you both.

40:32.722 --> 40:35.992
David, what you did today
is so special.

40:35.992 --> 40:39.429
This performance really
allowed us to get to know you

40:39.429 --> 40:41.297
in a new way
as an artist.

40:41.297 --> 40:42.665
You really let us all in
in a way

40:42.665 --> 40:46.469
that was really disarming,
and that's so beautiful.

40:46.469 --> 40:47.937
Thank you, Ari.
Thank you.

40:50.006 --> 40:51.641
Ryleigh,
you have the vocals

40:51.641 --> 40:54.811
of all the greats
of every genre,

40:54.811 --> 40:57.313
like, kind of put
in a blender.

40:57.313 --> 40:58.948
And the presence
of Ryleigh ‐‐

40:58.948 --> 41:01.551
you're a rock star,
you're a pop star,

41:01.551 --> 41:04.421
you're a disco diva,
and it's special

41:04.421 --> 41:07.357
to see you be you.

41:07.357 --> 41:10.260
Ari, not an easy decision.
No.

41:10.260 --> 41:12.829
Who is the winner
of this knockout?

41:17.767 --> 41:20.370
The winner of
this knockout...

41:23.773 --> 41:25.675
...is Ryleigh.

41:25.675 --> 41:28.411
Ryleigh Plank, congratulations,
you're moving on

41:28.411 --> 41:29.646
to the live play‐offs.

41:29.646 --> 41:31.815
I love you.
I love you.

41:31.815 --> 41:36.986
I had to go with Ryleigh.
I think she's one in a billion.

41:36.986 --> 41:41.057
Beautiful!
She's just the real deal.

41:41.057 --> 41:43.727
The fact that Ariana
has that faith in me

41:43.727 --> 41:46.329
is so extremely heartwarming.

41:46.329 --> 41:47.831
I'm just honored
and so grateful.

41:47.831 --> 41:49.933
Coaches, let me remind you that
David is available to steal.

41:49.933 --> 41:52.469
David, anything you'd like
to say to your coach?

41:52.469 --> 41:54.504
Ari,
this whole experience has been

41:54.504 --> 41:56.005
a highlight of my life.
Me too.

41:56.005 --> 41:58.775
You better believe I'm gonna get
a lunchbox tattoo on my arm.

41:58.775 --> 42:01.411
Give it up one more time
for David Vogel,

42:01.411 --> 42:02.412
ladies and gentlemen.

42:03.813 --> 42:07.484
Let's go!
Oh, wow. Oh!

42:07.484 --> 42:09.519
That's the sound of a steal

42:09.519 --> 42:13.790
for David Vogel!
From John Legend!

42:13.790 --> 42:15.558
David adds something different
to my team.

42:15.558 --> 42:17.527
We have no one
that sounds like him.

42:17.527 --> 42:20.029
I think Team Legend
just got a bit stronger.

42:20.029 --> 42:22.632
You're still gonna get
the tattoo, right? Okay.

42:22.632 --> 42:24.401
I don't know
about this tattoo, now.

42:24.401 --> 42:28.371
A Legend tattoo, maybe. So happy!

42:28.371 --> 42:29.606
Thank you, John.
Amazing.

42:29.606 --> 42:32.809
Thank you so much.
I am thrilled.
