01:23.654 --> 01:25.087
Warden.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.086
Warden.

01:29.654 --> 01:31.154
Bernadine.

01:31.952 --> 01:34.183
Everything is set.

01:34.185 --> 01:38.386
Good. Deputy Morgan will
notify you when it's time.

01:39.120 --> 01:40.253
Okay.

01:59.252 --> 02:01.053
Mrs. Jimenez?

02:02.919 --> 02:05.183
Have you heard anything?
Did they stop it?

02:05.185 --> 02:07.550
No. No.

02:11.220 --> 02:12.984
Okay. Come here,
come here.

02:12.986 --> 02:15.120
Sit, sit.

02:16.352 --> 02:17.386
Look.

02:19.219 --> 02:22.984
Nothing will happen
until we get clearance, okay?

02:22.986 --> 02:25.020
We haven't gotten clearance.

02:28.654 --> 02:30.585
We'll let you know.

02:30.587 --> 02:32.386
We'll let you know
when it's time.

02:49.052 --> 02:51.150
- <i>When do we want it?</i>
- <i>Here and now.</i>

02:51.152 --> 02:53.250
- What do we want?
- Respect for life.

02:53.252 --> 02:55.084
- When do we want it?
- Here and now.

02:55.086 --> 02:57.118
- What do we want?
- Respect for life!

02:57.120 --> 02:59.017
- When do we want it?
- Here and now.

02:59.019 --> 03:00.984
- What do we want?
- Respect for life!

03:00.986 --> 03:02.983
- When do we want it?
- Here and now.

03:02.985 --> 03:04.318
- What do we want?
- Respect for life!

03:04.320 --> 03:06.650
- When do we want it?
- Here and now.

03:21.985 --> 03:23.254
Bernadine?

03:26.186 --> 03:28.853
We heard back from
the director's office.

03:31.619 --> 03:33.853
Thank you, Deputy.

04:21.286 --> 04:22.920
Down. Down.

06:31.586 --> 06:33.120
I can try his foot.

07:02.586 --> 07:04.517
We can try his femoral vein.

07:04.519 --> 07:06.854
Get going. Do it.

07:08.985 --> 07:10.886
I'm here, Victor.

07:24.685 --> 07:27.251
Blessed is thy fruit
of thy womb Jesus.

07:27.253 --> 07:29.318
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

07:29.320 --> 07:32.017
now and at the hour
of my death.

07:50.952 --> 07:55.385
Mr. Jimenez,
can I get you anything?

08:29.253 --> 08:31.385
Do you have a final statement?

08:52.985 --> 09:00.284
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

09:01.053 --> 09:04.651
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

09:04.653 --> 09:06.887
on earth as it is in heaven.

09:09.919 --> 09:12.853
Give us this day
our daily bread...

09:14.318 --> 09:17.117
and forgive us
our trespasses,

09:17.119 --> 09:20.986
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

09:22.486 --> 09:25.019
Lead us not into temptation.

10:14.985 --> 10:16.352
Do something.

10:22.251 --> 10:25.249
What is happening?

10:25.251 --> 10:27.651
- I...
- Did you put enough in him?

10:27.653 --> 10:30.450
His heart was just slowing down.
I don't know why it didn't stop.

10:30.452 --> 10:32.120
He should be
unconscious.

10:36.120 --> 10:37.950
His vein's infiltrated.

10:37.952 --> 10:39.549
Find another vein.

10:39.551 --> 10:41.651
- Do you have more drugs?
- Uh, I don't know.

10:41.653 --> 10:43.516
Get the director
on the phone.

10:47.451 --> 10:49.987
Warden, he's dead.

10:59.386 --> 11:00.450
Are you sure?

11:00.452 --> 11:01.986
Yes.

11:05.086 --> 11:07.453
Do you wanna get the doctor
in here to confirm?

11:10.952 --> 11:12.219
Warden?

11:13.486 --> 11:15.353
Yes. Get the doctor.

11:18.953 --> 11:21.420
We call his death,
10:47 p.m.

11:52.519 --> 11:55.050
Well, we got a couple more
requests from two reporters.

11:55.052 --> 11:58.950
They're local. They just wanna come in
and maybe talk with you for a few minutes.

11:58.952 --> 12:02.117
But I know you're busy. Maybe they
can talk to you or somebody else...

12:02.119 --> 12:03.884
Monica is in charge
of all media requests.

12:03.886 --> 12:07.517
I know, but she's been telling people no because
that's what you've been telling her to say.

12:07.519 --> 12:12.119
Sonia, I do not want
any media in this prison.

12:15.252 --> 12:17.550
Okay. Well, that lawyer
from Legal Action Now

12:17.552 --> 12:20.350
wants to bring one or two people
in to visit Woods.

12:20.352 --> 12:23.284
They think he might get
his appeal decision today.

12:23.286 --> 12:25.149
Are they
representing him now?

12:25.151 --> 12:27.117
I don't think so.
I guess they just wanna see him.

12:27.119 --> 12:28.918
They faxed their
paperwork in last night.

12:28.920 --> 12:31.987
Then they need to make sure
they're on his visitation list.

12:32.919 --> 12:36.383
- Make sure nobody comes in with him.
- Mm-hmm.

12:36.385 --> 12:39.449
They're always trying to bring
people in to visit the inmates.

12:39.451 --> 12:40.853
Okay.

12:41.986 --> 12:43.684
Anything else, Sonia?

12:43.686 --> 12:45.118
No.

12:48.152 --> 12:50.316
You know, Woods' mom's
funeral is today.

12:50.318 --> 12:51.385
I know.

12:52.552 --> 12:57.083
Block out a full hour for
the executive staff meet today.

12:57.085 --> 12:58.954
We'll be done by 2:00.

13:01.919 --> 13:03.319
Okay.

13:06.219 --> 13:09.283
Mr. Hugger. Mr. Martinez.

13:09.285 --> 13:11.253
- Good morning.
- Yeah, good.

13:40.985 --> 13:42.352
Woods, you're up.

14:03.519 --> 14:04.617
Open 32.

14:04.619 --> 14:05.683
<i>Copy that.</i>

14:19.984 --> 14:21.550
Woods, you can't
put all these up.

14:31.419 --> 14:32.982
Mr. Johnson.

14:32.984 --> 14:34.986
- Mr. Brooks.
- Warden.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.286
Mr. Woods.

14:40.118 --> 14:43.317
If you want to phone someone
after your mother's funeral,

14:43.319 --> 14:44.986
I will allow that.

14:56.318 --> 14:57.419
You're set.

15:25.385 --> 15:26.918
Oh, jeez.

15:29.251 --> 15:30.853
Oh.

15:31.386 --> 15:32.919
I'm sorry.

15:33.952 --> 15:35.320
Okay.

15:42.518 --> 15:44.219
Move your foot.

16:03.686 --> 16:07.149
<i>...seem dark
even when the sun is shining.</i>

16:07.151 --> 16:09.150
<i>When you're in bed,
the pitch black of your room</i>

16:09.152 --> 16:12.350
<i>can offer more comfort
than a loved one's embrace.</i>

16:12.352 --> 16:14.483
<i>When you feel
that your soul is tired</i>

16:14.485 --> 16:17.249
<i>even in the happiest of moments.</i>

16:17.251 --> 16:19.949
<i>If you've struggled
with depression before,</i>

16:19.951 --> 16:22.617
<i>if you tried
other medications...</i>

16:22.619 --> 16:24.219
Bernadine.

16:25.319 --> 16:26.986
Is it too loud?

16:27.452 --> 16:28.953
No.

16:35.286 --> 16:37.886
You have to go to work
in four hours.

16:39.385 --> 16:40.919
So do you.

16:42.119 --> 16:44.886
I know. I'm fine.

16:46.118 --> 16:48.350
Well, I wanna share a bed
with my wife.

16:48.352 --> 16:53.220
Now, Bernadine, how long
is this gonna be going on?

16:53.984 --> 16:55.419
I don't know.

16:57.685 --> 16:59.185
Go to bed.

17:00.451 --> 17:01.852
Go on.

17:02.218 --> 17:03.385
Please?

17:07.219 --> 17:08.252
Go.

18:51.586 --> 18:54.986
Man, I don't know who's
worse about those damn birds,

18:55.585 --> 18:57.352
him or Woods.

18:59.653 --> 19:01.853
They're both
strange fuckers.

19:07.653 --> 19:10.986
Do you think they're gonna
go through with it this time?

19:12.385 --> 19:14.319
We'll know any day now.

19:16.952 --> 19:20.017
I hear the attorney general
might recommend an investigation

19:20.019 --> 19:22.249
into what happened
with Jimenez.

19:22.251 --> 19:23.518
Is that true?

19:25.518 --> 19:29.852
If there is a review, I will make
sure that it happens internally.

19:33.252 --> 19:36.017
Well, we handled
everything by the book.

19:36.019 --> 19:37.416
You know that, right?

19:37.418 --> 19:40.182
Nobody was gonna find
a working vein.

19:40.184 --> 19:41.949
Jimenez didn't drink
any water that day.

19:41.951 --> 19:43.352
Why didn't he?

19:48.019 --> 19:51.119
I'm reviewing protocol
with the director next week.

19:51.651 --> 19:53.385
I'll give you any updates.

19:57.618 --> 19:59.417
It's a group of lawyers.

19:59.419 --> 20:02.350
How much trouble could
they possibly cause?

20:02.352 --> 20:04.149
They just wanna talk
to the guy.

20:04.151 --> 20:06.283
Hey, they're not on
his visitation list,

20:06.285 --> 20:08.650
and they're not a part
of his legal team.

20:08.652 --> 20:13.349
If they wanna talk to him, they can write
him a letter, call him on the phone.

20:13.351 --> 20:14.183
Those are the rules.

20:14.185 --> 20:16.284
He's not gonna do that.
You know that.

20:16.286 --> 20:18.517
He's numb, he's...
he's cut people out,

20:18.519 --> 20:20.353
people have cut him out now.

20:21.151 --> 20:23.683
Now his mom is dead.

20:23.685 --> 20:25.517
I just want him to know

20:25.519 --> 20:28.353
that there are people
out there that support him.

20:29.118 --> 20:31.118
He didn't get his appeal,
did he?

20:33.386 --> 20:35.615
It's just a conversation.

20:35.617 --> 20:38.118
Marty, no, I can't.

20:41.119 --> 20:43.117
You know,
for the past seven years,

20:43.119 --> 20:45.349
you've blocked every
single attempt I've made

20:45.351 --> 20:48.150
to try to get him to be
treated like a human being.

20:48.152 --> 20:49.917
You're gonna kill him.
Isn't that enough?

20:49.919 --> 20:54.317
I have treated him like a human
being every step of the way.

20:54.319 --> 20:56.249
It's not my job
to bypass the rules

20:56.251 --> 20:58.117
to accommodate
your special request.

20:58.119 --> 21:00.949
Special request.
How is it a special request?

21:00.951 --> 21:02.683
Open the gates, please.
I'd like to leave now.

21:02.685 --> 21:06.549
- That's a special request?
- I have to maintain order and safety in this prison.

21:06.551 --> 21:08.150
I got over a thousand bodies

21:08.152 --> 21:11.117
that I have to ensure
are safe and accounted for.

21:11.119 --> 21:13.950
It's hard enough without you
complicating things.

21:13.952 --> 21:15.316
What you have to do
is protect yourself

21:15.318 --> 21:17.016
now that this place
is under fire

21:17.018 --> 21:19.683
since you botched
the last execution.

21:19.685 --> 21:21.349
- Get out of my office.
- Put up the barricades,

21:21.351 --> 21:24.017
keep the outside world out
so you can kill him

21:24.019 --> 21:25.548
as under the radar
as possible.

21:25.550 --> 21:29.050
- Get out.
- And remove any dignity the man has left to boot.

21:29.052 --> 21:31.317
- Go.
- Yeah, I'm going, but I'm not going far.

21:31.319 --> 21:33.650
Just so you know,
I am going to fight for him

21:33.652 --> 21:35.150
right up until
the very moment

21:35.152 --> 21:37.253
you stick that needle
in his arm.

21:37.951 --> 21:39.252
Just so you know.

22:23.219 --> 22:24.249
Anthony.

22:24.251 --> 22:26.185
It's good
to see you, man.

22:28.252 --> 22:30.650
Now, you promised me you
was gonna eat some potatoes.

22:30.652 --> 22:33.650
You look a lot skinnier than
the last time I saw you.

22:33.652 --> 22:36.186
Yeah? Potatoes, huh?

22:36.951 --> 22:39.516
Uh, I tried. I forgot.

22:39.518 --> 22:41.017
I'm a little busy.

22:43.419 --> 22:45.249
How are you holding up?

22:45.251 --> 22:47.616
Uh, you know,
it is what it is.

22:47.618 --> 22:49.453
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

22:50.351 --> 22:53.182
Hey, man,
I wanted to apologize

22:53.184 --> 22:55.183
for not coming
to see you last week.

22:55.185 --> 22:58.516
- It was just, my mama had passed and...
- I get it.

22:58.518 --> 23:01.516
You know what, I just...
I didn't wanna see anybody that day.

23:01.518 --> 23:03.249
I get it. I understand.

23:03.251 --> 23:05.683
Yeah, but you drove
all that way, you know.

23:05.685 --> 23:07.186
No worries.

23:08.685 --> 23:09.982
All right.

23:09.984 --> 23:12.083
So what's going on,
Marty?

23:12.085 --> 23:14.253
Tell me.
You got some news?

23:16.151 --> 23:17.250
Uh-huh.

23:17.252 --> 23:20.615
You're gonna be
my last client, Anthony.

23:20.617 --> 23:22.353
I'm retiring.

23:24.618 --> 23:26.649
What... What happened?

23:26.651 --> 23:28.349
What happened?
I don't know.

23:28.351 --> 23:31.249
I've been doing this for 30
years, that's what happened.

23:31.251 --> 23:33.683
For five years you've been telling
me they'd have to carry you out

23:33.685 --> 23:36.017
before you leave
Legal Action Now.

23:36.019 --> 23:37.452
Yeah, lawyer humor.

23:39.451 --> 23:42.182
Look, I know you got to do
what you got to do, Marty,

23:42.184 --> 23:44.183
but you're the first
lawyer I've ever had

23:44.185 --> 23:47.153
that's made me feel like I
actually got a shot at this.

23:50.985 --> 23:54.649
I think it's time
the kids took over.

23:54.651 --> 23:57.183
Uh, I had a baby lawyer today

23:57.185 --> 24:00.116
teach me how to do a press
conference on Snapchat.

24:00.118 --> 24:02.252
It's time to see
what they can do.

24:07.118 --> 24:08.952
I don't believe you.

24:35.585 --> 24:37.982
You have some
catching up to do.

24:37.984 --> 24:39.852
All right.

24:40.919 --> 24:42.683
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:42.685 --> 24:44.683
What you got there?

24:44.685 --> 24:47.153
Ah, libations.

24:48.985 --> 24:51.216
- And how are you?
- Oh, I'm great.

24:51.218 --> 24:54.253
I mean,
now that I'm here.

24:57.652 --> 25:00.983
You know,
Director said Mrs. Jimenez

25:00.985 --> 25:04.583
wants to handle all the
arrangements for burial.

25:04.585 --> 25:06.186
Mm-hmm.

25:09.151 --> 25:10.549
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

25:10.551 --> 25:14.019
She... Thank you.

25:14.684 --> 25:19.018
She doesn't want the state
doing jack shit.

25:19.517 --> 25:21.982
And I can understand that.

25:21.984 --> 25:25.650
But I am pretty sure
she has no money.

25:25.652 --> 25:28.186
- Bernadine.
- What?

25:32.518 --> 25:36.253
We're not at the prison
anymore. We're here.

25:39.985 --> 25:41.916
You're right, we're here.

25:41.918 --> 25:43.152
Yeah.

25:48.084 --> 25:53.982
So, how's your...
how's your children?

25:53.984 --> 25:56.283
How many kids do you have?

25:56.285 --> 25:59.916
My God.
You suck at conversation.

25:59.918 --> 26:02.415
Officer. Officer.

26:02.417 --> 26:04.650
- Hey, hey.
- Thomas.

26:04.652 --> 26:06.515
- Give me those keys.
- No.

26:06.517 --> 26:08.549
- No, hey.
- You dropped my purse.

26:08.551 --> 26:10.220
You made me drop it.

26:10.984 --> 26:12.682
No keys for you.

26:12.684 --> 26:14.382
Bernadine.

26:14.384 --> 26:17.448
- No.
- No way, no way.

26:17.450 --> 26:19.415
Thomas, I'm fine.

26:20.984 --> 26:23.217
I'm the warden
and I'm fine.

26:23.219 --> 26:25.217
Come here.
You're not driving.

26:25.219 --> 26:27.117
- No.
- Yes.

26:27.119 --> 26:30.083
- You give me those keys.
- Don't do that to me.

26:30.085 --> 26:32.516
Don't do that to me,
because I'm fine.

26:32.518 --> 26:35.382
You give me those keys
or I'm gonna start dancing.

26:35.384 --> 26:38.251
Oh, hell.

26:41.318 --> 26:42.451
Get in there.

26:44.317 --> 26:45.649
I am the warden.

26:45.651 --> 26:47.082
Yeah, you are.

26:47.084 --> 26:49.548
I do a damn good job.

26:49.550 --> 26:52.484
I do a goddamn good job.

26:53.018 --> 26:54.853
Yeah, you do.

26:58.385 --> 26:59.986
That's all I'm saying.

27:02.351 --> 27:04.649
All right, come on.
I'll take you home.

27:04.651 --> 27:07.249
And Jonathan can drop you
back here

27:07.251 --> 27:10.385
for your car
in the morning, okay?

27:36.984 --> 27:40.650
<i>By late Monday, the blaze
threatened more than 108 structures.</i>

27:40.652 --> 27:43.515
<i>Bradley Ross, a heavy
fire equipment operator,</i>

27:43.517 --> 27:45.549
<i>was seriously injured
battling the fire</i>

27:45.551 --> 27:48.083
<i>when the bulldozer
he was operating rolled over.</i>

27:48.085 --> 27:50.083
<i>Ross was rushed
to Highland General</i>

27:50.085 --> 27:52.150
<i>and is expected to make
a fast recovery.</i>

27:52.152 --> 27:54.050
<i>We now go over to Pam Dawson</i>

27:54.052 --> 27:57.385
<i>in our newsroom
with a special update. Pam?</i>

27:59.984 --> 28:04.016
<i>The final appeal for the man
convicted of killing Officer Robert Collins</i>

28:04.018 --> 28:06.916
<i>15 years ago
was denied this evening.</i>

28:06.918 --> 28:08.516
<i>Anthony Woods
has been on death row</i>

28:08.518 --> 28:10.382
<i>for the shooting of
Officer Collins</i>

28:10.384 --> 28:13.218
<i>and will now await
a death warrant from the state.</i>

28:13.985 --> 28:15.215
<i>Mr. Woods' legal team</i>

28:15.217 --> 28:17.116
<i>is expected to fight
for a reprieve</i>

28:17.118 --> 28:19.382
<i>to prevent his
forthcoming execution.</i>

28:19.384 --> 28:23.117
<i>Ultimately, the governor has the
power to grant Mr. Woods clemency,</i>

28:23.119 --> 28:25.919
<i>even moments before
his execution.</i>

28:44.484 --> 28:46.017
Hey.

28:46.019 --> 28:48.185
Hey, baby,
what's wrong?

28:49.985 --> 28:52.285
Come on, talk to me, huh?
What's wrong?

28:53.318 --> 28:55.449
Tell me. Huh?

28:55.451 --> 28:58.382
I'm okay. I'm okay.

28:58.384 --> 28:59.853
You sure?

29:02.517 --> 29:03.985
Yeah.

29:10.951 --> 29:12.451
I can't sleep.

29:14.484 --> 29:15.952
Mm-hmm.

29:18.450 --> 29:20.451
I can't go to sleep.

29:22.651 --> 29:24.184
You all right?

29:25.218 --> 29:26.285
Yeah.

29:38.351 --> 29:39.419
All right.

30:02.550 --> 30:03.985
Yeah.

30:04.518 --> 30:06.052
I'll do it again.

30:06.985 --> 30:08.319
You sure?

30:09.517 --> 30:10.985
Yeah.

30:12.652 --> 30:14.516
You're under
no obligation...

30:14.518 --> 30:16.352
No, it's fine.

30:17.450 --> 30:19.415
I'll do it.

30:19.417 --> 30:23.115
We're getting a different
medical person though, right?

30:23.117 --> 30:24.152
Yes.

30:25.285 --> 30:27.986
And the director
will be there this time.

30:29.217 --> 30:30.351
Okay.

30:31.652 --> 30:35.116
Deputy Morgan
will also be there to, um,

30:35.118 --> 30:38.252
support and assist
when necessary.

30:41.385 --> 30:44.582
Thomas, we're gonna need another
volunteer for a rehearsal.

30:44.584 --> 30:48.185
Bring some officers around this
afternoon to speak with me.

30:48.618 --> 30:50.085
I'll do it.

30:50.652 --> 30:54.285
- Thank you.
- No, I mean, I'll do it.

30:56.418 --> 30:58.984
The guys can practice
strapping me in.

31:03.517 --> 31:05.185
That's not your job.

31:06.517 --> 31:08.282
It won't be a problem.

31:08.284 --> 31:11.117
They just strap me up
and take me down, right?

31:15.485 --> 31:16.886
Okay.

31:17.451 --> 31:19.219
I'll put you down.

31:24.351 --> 31:27.148
Four hours
from the execution,

31:27.150 --> 31:30.181
all communication with
outside parties will cease.

31:30.183 --> 31:34.015
That includes Mr. Lumetta,
friends, family members,

31:34.017 --> 31:38.115
but you can be with the chaplain
the entire day,

31:38.117 --> 31:40.152
all the way through
the procedure.

31:41.117 --> 31:43.349
You will have to take
your clothes off,

31:43.351 --> 31:46.319
wear the shirt, the pants,
the shoes issued to you.

31:47.350 --> 31:49.082
When it's time
for the procedure,

31:49.084 --> 31:51.115
you will be walked
to the chamber

31:51.117 --> 31:54.384
where five officers will
restrain you to the gurney.

31:55.450 --> 31:59.318
A medical professional will
prepare you for your injection.

32:00.183 --> 32:03.015
Officer will insert
the midazolam.

32:03.017 --> 32:06.282
That will render you
unconscious.

32:06.284 --> 32:09.650
The second drug
is pancuronium bromide,

32:09.652 --> 32:11.982
which causes paralyzation.

32:11.984 --> 32:15.516
The last drug
is potassium chloride,

32:15.518 --> 32:17.918
which will cease
heart function.

32:19.183 --> 32:22.349
At that point,
medical personnel

32:22.351 --> 32:25.148
will confirm
the execution complete.

32:25.150 --> 32:28.482
Now, if you wanna talk
to Mr. Lumetta about this,

32:28.484 --> 32:31.184
later you can,
but do you have any questions?

32:37.518 --> 32:41.385
Do you have any family that
would like to claim your body?

32:46.218 --> 32:49.419
If there are no family members
that wish to claim your body,

32:50.551 --> 32:53.249
your remains
will be laid to rest

32:53.251 --> 32:57.252
in a plot here on our property
owned by the state.

33:05.652 --> 33:11.452
Mr. Woods, you have the option
of selecting your witnesses.

33:15.518 --> 33:21.152
It's good to have one or two
people who you know by your side.

33:23.917 --> 33:25.385
Maybe your lawyers.

33:38.317 --> 33:39.418
No?

33:44.684 --> 33:46.219
Okay.

33:48.184 --> 33:49.284
Okay.

36:41.018 --> 36:43.118
Woods,
you all right there?

36:47.384 --> 36:51.316
- Hey, what's going on?
- Need backup.

36:51.318 --> 36:53.151
<i>Coming your way now.</i>

36:56.384 --> 36:58.982
Man, watch out.
They coming. The guard's coming.

36:58.984 --> 37:00.215
Open, 32.

37:00.217 --> 37:01.984
<i>Roger.</i>

37:07.318 --> 37:08.749
Calm down.

37:08.751 --> 37:12.284
- Leave my boy alone! He ain't done nothin'!
- Hey, hey.

37:13.983 --> 37:18.015
Get off me! Let me die!
Let go! Let me die!

37:18.017 --> 37:19.549
Calm down!
Get control of yourself!

37:19.551 --> 37:22.149
We have a medical signal three.
We need backup.

37:22.151 --> 37:25.582
No more appeals!
Fuck it. I did it. Kill me!

37:25.584 --> 37:28.981
Kill me!
I said what I done!

37:28.983 --> 37:33.284
I said what I done!
Let me go!

38:06.285 --> 38:07.419
Officers.

38:40.251 --> 38:41.351
Dan.

38:43.584 --> 38:45.048
Hi there.

38:45.050 --> 38:46.582
Get my guys there,

38:46.584 --> 38:49.852
I'll take a Johnny Black.
And Marty.

38:55.051 --> 38:56.851
Thanks for telling me.

38:59.984 --> 39:01.385
How's he doing?

39:03.683 --> 39:05.251
He's gonna be okay.

39:08.284 --> 39:10.852
You'll be able to see him
in a few days.

39:13.583 --> 39:15.117
Okay.

39:21.651 --> 39:24.382
I won't be around
much longer.

39:24.384 --> 39:26.851
I'm done after Anthony.

39:29.350 --> 39:31.251
What are you gonna do?

39:32.083 --> 39:33.851
Shit, I don't know.

39:34.449 --> 39:35.918
Teach.

39:38.516 --> 39:40.581
That's what you want?

39:40.583 --> 39:42.950
The thought makes me
wanna throw up.

39:47.017 --> 39:49.351
But I know
I don't want this.

39:51.617 --> 39:53.948
I don't wanna see
another client

39:53.950 --> 39:56.984
try to bust his head open,
commit suicide...

39:58.184 --> 40:00.285
before you guys
get to him.

40:04.950 --> 40:07.184
You know what side I'm on.

40:13.651 --> 40:15.319
Think about this.

40:17.117 --> 40:22.118
When I win,
my client gets to not die.

40:32.484 --> 40:34.218
How do you keep
doing it?

40:35.550 --> 40:37.184
I do my job.

40:39.318 --> 40:42.649
You wanna believe
there's good guys and bad guys,

40:42.651 --> 40:45.118
and I'm one of the bad guys.

40:47.183 --> 40:49.985
But I give these men
respect, Marty.

40:51.517 --> 40:53.052
All the way through.

40:53.617 --> 40:55.649
I give them
real-world training

40:55.651 --> 40:58.985
for whenever some of them
might get out.

41:02.450 --> 41:04.384
You can't save the world.

41:08.584 --> 41:10.084
Yeah.

41:12.650 --> 41:14.351
That's the problem.

41:24.150 --> 41:25.917
Thanks for the drink.

41:26.584 --> 41:28.417
You have a good night,
Warden.

41:29.450 --> 41:30.885
Night.

42:09.051 --> 42:10.384
Good evening, baby.

42:12.017 --> 42:14.347
Good evening.

42:14.349 --> 42:17.383
I know you said you didn't
want anything this year, but...

42:18.450 --> 42:21.481
Oh. Oh.

42:21.483 --> 42:23.181
Happy anniversary.

42:23.183 --> 42:25.481
Jonathan.

42:25.483 --> 42:26.949
Yeah.

42:26.951 --> 42:29.118
It is beautiful.

42:29.617 --> 42:31.118
I know.

42:32.449 --> 42:35.251
I wanna get back
to where we were, Bernadine.

42:35.651 --> 42:37.251
And I know we can.

42:38.118 --> 42:39.118
Hmm?

42:44.251 --> 42:45.351
Hmm.

42:48.549 --> 42:51.017
Oh. And you're
gonna like this.

43:06.384 --> 43:07.451
Give me that.

43:30.583 --> 43:31.982
Oh, Bernadine.

43:36.316 --> 43:37.949
Ohh.

43:37.951 --> 43:40.415
- I love you, baby.
- I love you too.

43:40.417 --> 43:41.985
I love you too.

43:45.517 --> 43:47.251
Oh, you feel so good.

43:49.018 --> 43:50.384
Yeah, I want you.

43:51.517 --> 43:53.283
I want you so bad.

43:53.917 --> 43:55.951
- Baby.
- Yeah.

44:04.384 --> 44:05.852
Damn.

44:06.317 --> 44:07.451
Mmm.

44:15.317 --> 44:18.018
I want this to be
my last year.

44:21.383 --> 44:23.118
Your last year for what?

44:26.449 --> 44:30.183
It's not that far off from
when we talked about retiring.

44:35.384 --> 44:38.052
What? Wait, babe.

44:39.449 --> 44:40.917
The...

44:42.217 --> 44:43.915
Is that what
this is all about?

44:43.917 --> 44:47.482
That... This is
my anniversary.

44:47.484 --> 44:50.282
Oh, God.
I can't believe you.

44:50.284 --> 44:52.116
Baby, I think
stepping away from our jobs

44:52.118 --> 44:54.314
would be good for us,
be good for you.

44:54.316 --> 44:57.682
You know what? You do
what you need to do.

44:57.684 --> 45:01.081
And mine is not a job.
It's a profession.

45:01.083 --> 45:02.614
And me, it will be good
for me too.

45:02.616 --> 45:05.051
Yeah, it's all about you.

45:07.850 --> 45:11.348
I don't know if this is gonna make
things better, but I'm trying.

45:11.350 --> 45:14.448
I'm the one who gave things up
in this marriage.

45:14.450 --> 45:19.215
What did you give up?
What did you give up?

45:19.217 --> 45:22.116
I'm just reminding you
that I sacrificed...

45:22.650 --> 45:23.982
because I love you.

45:23.984 --> 45:26.648
And I respect your profession.

45:26.650 --> 45:28.450
And I want this to work.

45:31.250 --> 45:35.151
But I don't see how
it's gonna work...

45:36.183 --> 45:38.918
living with
an empty shell of a wife.

45:39.983 --> 45:42.150
I need a pulse, Bernadine.

45:43.249 --> 45:48.417
I need to know that you're still
here, that I'm still here.

45:56.616 --> 45:57.985
Okay.

46:37.349 --> 46:40.447
<i>Anthony has always
maintained culpability</i>

46:40.449 --> 46:42.447
<i>in the crime of robbery,</i>

46:42.449 --> 46:44.247
<i>which he did commit
that night,</i>

46:44.249 --> 46:46.215
<i>for which he has
more than paid,</i>

46:46.217 --> 46:49.414
<i>serving almost 15 years
on death row.</i>

46:49.416 --> 46:53.081
<i>Yet... Yet he maintains,
and we maintain,</i>

46:53.083 --> 46:56.547
<i>that he was not involved
in the shooting.</i>

46:56.549 --> 46:59.080
<i>Surveillance footage of the
convenience store that night</i>

46:59.082 --> 47:01.247
<i>shows two masked men.</i>

47:01.249 --> 47:03.147
<i>The shooter was left-handed</i>

47:03.149 --> 47:05.514
<i>and considerably shorter
than Anthony Woods,</i>

47:05.516 --> 47:06.948
<i>who is right-handed.</i>

47:06.950 --> 47:08.515
<i>And new ballistic technology</i>

47:08.517 --> 47:11.916
<i>proves that the type of gun
used in the shooting</i>

47:11.918 --> 47:14.047
<i>of Officer Collins that night</i>

47:14.049 --> 47:16.681
<i>was owned by James Taylor.</i>

47:16.683 --> 47:18.347
<i>This was also confirmed</i>

47:18.349 --> 47:21.681
<i>by several people who knew
James from his neighborhood.</i>

47:21.683 --> 47:25.447
<i>Four of the five eyewitnesses
have recanted their statements.</i>

47:25.449 --> 47:28.247
<i>Most of the jurors
from the original trial</i>

47:28.249 --> 47:32.114
<i>have stated that they cannot
say with 100% certainty</i>

47:32.116 --> 47:34.315
<i>that Anthony Wood
was the shooter.</i>

47:34.317 --> 47:37.417
<i>All this...
and James Taylor.</i>

47:50.917 --> 47:53.851
Abolish the death penalty!

47:59.116 --> 48:02.251
The last meal is your choice.

48:03.317 --> 48:04.384
Anything.

48:05.150 --> 48:07.384
Anything you want,
just about.

48:13.517 --> 48:18.852
Like seafood, halal.

48:23.516 --> 48:25.051
Vegan.

48:26.082 --> 48:28.383
A lot of guys
want steak and lobster.

48:34.384 --> 48:38.980
But it's your...
it's your choice.

48:38.982 --> 48:40.984
You get to choose.

48:48.183 --> 48:49.450
Mr. Woods.

48:51.117 --> 48:53.350
You do something
for yourself.

49:02.182 --> 49:04.150
You need to eat something.

49:05.384 --> 49:07.184
Let me know.

49:08.116 --> 49:09.984
Hang on, Mr. Woods.

49:15.117 --> 49:17.517
<i>"I am an invisible man.</i>

49:18.684 --> 49:23.218
No, I am not a spook like those
who haunted Edgar Allan Poe.

49:24.216 --> 49:28.317
Nor am I one of your
Hollywood movie ectoplasms.

49:28.983 --> 49:34.081
I am a man of substance,

49:34.083 --> 49:37.851
of flesh and bone,
fiber and liquids.

49:38.982 --> 49:41.450
And I might even be said
to possess a mind.

49:43.183 --> 49:46.649
I am invisible, understand,

49:46.651 --> 49:50.883
simply because people
refuse to see me.

49:51.684 --> 49:54.014
Like the bodiless heads you see

49:54.016 --> 49:57.017
sometimes in circus sideshows,

49:57.651 --> 50:00.682
it is as though
I have been surrounded

50:00.684 --> 50:04.983
by mirrors of hard,
distorting glass.

50:06.149 --> 50:10.248
When they approach me,
they see only my surroundings,

50:10.250 --> 50:13.451
themselves, or figments
of their imagination.

50:14.684 --> 50:18.051
Indeed, everything and anything,

50:20.483 --> 50:22.117
except me."

50:45.182 --> 50:46.218
Hey.

50:52.284 --> 50:54.314
Aren't you supposed
to be at work?

50:54.316 --> 50:55.317
I left early.

50:55.983 --> 50:57.917
I wanted to catch you.

51:01.516 --> 51:03.648
Bernadine, I can't.

51:03.650 --> 51:05.116
Okay.

51:05.684 --> 51:07.951
Where have you been staying?

51:09.316 --> 51:10.980
A motel nearby.

51:10.982 --> 51:12.250
Which one?

51:16.651 --> 51:19.915
I need to pack up
and head out of here.

51:19.917 --> 51:22.451
- Are you coming home?
- I don't know, Bernadine.

51:25.416 --> 51:26.983
I miss you.

51:31.283 --> 51:32.418
I, uh...

51:34.383 --> 51:35.883
I gotta go.

52:44.917 --> 52:46.215
It's always this easy?

52:46.217 --> 52:48.251
You can resist a little
if you want to.

52:49.116 --> 52:50.980
Treat him like you would.

52:52.383 --> 52:55.150
There usually
isn't any resistance.

52:57.349 --> 53:01.050
After you restrain him, I want you all
to wait in the room with the major,

53:01.650 --> 53:03.984
just in case we need you
back out here.

53:05.117 --> 53:06.950
You got that, Major?

53:13.616 --> 53:15.050
Logan?

53:24.516 --> 53:26.850
Logan?

53:27.549 --> 53:29.051
Logan?

53:32.550 --> 53:34.084
Logan.

53:35.583 --> 53:38.017
I'm sorry.

53:38.484 --> 53:39.951
I, um...

53:42.250 --> 53:44.850
I couldn't stop seeing him.

53:48.683 --> 53:50.851
You can't be on the team.

53:54.650 --> 53:57.017
I'll find your
replacement this week.

54:03.683 --> 54:05.250
I'm sorry, Bernadine.

54:16.384 --> 54:22.148
This process...
Our department's top priority.

54:22.150 --> 54:27.883
The procedure...
The procedure is safe to...

54:28.583 --> 54:31.382
Warden.
Sorry to interrupt.

54:31.384 --> 54:33.647
Our mail clerk brought me
something this afternoon.

54:33.649 --> 54:37.282
Sonia, there's plenty of people you
can talk to about the mail besides me.

54:37.284 --> 54:38.384
I know.

54:40.917 --> 54:42.418
But this should be you.

55:15.117 --> 55:17.151
They've never
been here before.

55:17.982 --> 55:21.251
Warden, he shouldn't
have to die alone.

56:24.449 --> 56:25.513
<i>Bernie.</i>

56:27.649 --> 56:29.513
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

56:29.515 --> 56:30.981
It's me, baby girl.

56:30.983 --> 56:32.382
Oh, God, you scared me.

56:32.384 --> 56:34.415
I know, I know. Shh.

56:36.416 --> 56:37.681
All right.

56:46.549 --> 56:48.183
What are you doing here?

56:54.649 --> 56:56.384
This is our home.

57:13.415 --> 57:14.983
This is our home.

57:25.917 --> 57:27.117
Oh.

57:32.582 --> 57:33.914
Hmm.

57:33.916 --> 57:36.014
No justice, no peace.

57:36.016 --> 57:40.980
No justice, no peace.
No justice, no peace.

57:40.982 --> 57:43.513
No justice, no peace.

57:43.515 --> 57:45.980
No justice, no peace.

57:45.982 --> 57:48.015
I am Anthony Woods!

57:48.017 --> 57:50.647
We are Anthony Woods!

57:50.649 --> 57:55.314
I am Anthony Woods!
I am Anthony Woods!

57:55.316 --> 57:57.680
I am Anthony Woods!

57:57.682 --> 58:02.251
We are Anthony Woods!
We are Anthony Woods!

58:05.982 --> 58:08.981
You really could've
e-mailed me these papers.

58:08.983 --> 58:10.647
Oh, we know.

58:10.649 --> 58:15.114
But we thought maybe it'd make a
difference if we asked you in person.

58:15.116 --> 58:19.414
Oh, we know that
there's a limit, we do.

58:19.416 --> 58:23.251
But we really wanted to bring in
another witness on Robert's side.

58:24.116 --> 58:27.117
It's his son, our grandson.

58:28.283 --> 58:32.150
We already have ten people
attending the execution.

58:33.116 --> 58:37.248
Mrs. Williams, he's his son.

58:37.250 --> 58:40.218
And we just want him
to have some closure.

58:41.682 --> 58:44.080
I understand that.
I'm sorry.

58:44.082 --> 58:47.115
But is there anybody
from his side coming?

58:47.117 --> 58:49.947
I mean,
most people like him

58:49.949 --> 58:51.981
don't usually have much
family sticking around.

58:51.983 --> 58:53.648
Can't we take
one of their places?

58:53.650 --> 58:56.151
It's not done like that,
Mrs. Collins.

58:58.917 --> 59:00.514
We understand.

59:00.516 --> 59:05.513
Mrs. Williams,
I'm sure you've made exceptions before.

59:05.515 --> 59:07.382
No, I haven't.

59:07.982 --> 59:09.413
Or you just won't.

59:09.415 --> 59:10.980
Sandra.

59:10.982 --> 59:12.417
He wants to go.

59:15.116 --> 59:16.984
There's nothing
you can do?

59:17.316 --> 59:18.383
No, ma'am.

59:22.449 --> 59:24.116
Thank you for your time.

59:24.950 --> 59:26.283
Certainly.

59:28.150 --> 59:31.114
Are you permitting them to
make that noise out there?

59:31.116 --> 59:32.948
It's outside
my jurisdiction.

59:32.950 --> 59:34.382
It's not state property.

59:35.249 --> 59:37.381
Are they gonna be there
the day it happens?

59:37.383 --> 59:39.314
I'm sure they will be.

59:39.316 --> 59:42.280
She can't
control who shows up outside.

59:42.282 --> 59:43.513
Come on, honey.

59:43.515 --> 59:45.048
I know
it's your job...

59:45.050 --> 59:47.681
not to get
personally involved,

59:47.683 --> 59:50.283
but can you imagine...

59:51.183 --> 59:53.617
how difficult this is
for a mother?

59:54.449 --> 59:57.915
Hmm? Do you have children,
Mrs. Williams?

59:57.917 --> 01:00:00.383
Sandy, let's go.

01:00:06.917 --> 01:00:10.181
Can... Can you understand

01:00:10.183 --> 01:00:13.916
what all this kind of thing
does to a family?

01:00:27.516 --> 01:00:29.114
Thank you.

01:00:29.116 --> 01:00:31.151
You're welcome,
Mr. Collins.

01:00:52.917 --> 01:00:54.917
I feel good
about the team.

01:00:56.616 --> 01:00:59.647
And you made
the right call,

01:00:59.649 --> 01:01:01.916
removing Logan
from this duty.

01:01:13.316 --> 01:01:15.984
You know, that warden's
position opened up.

01:01:18.049 --> 01:01:20.017
You'd make a good warden.

01:01:22.282 --> 01:01:23.382
You think so?

01:01:24.483 --> 01:01:26.513
I can handle it.

01:01:26.515 --> 01:01:28.383
Been seeing you do it
for years.

01:01:33.316 --> 01:01:36.051
Of course,
there's no death row in that prison.

01:01:41.683 --> 01:01:43.851
I'm gonna go for it.

01:01:46.515 --> 01:01:47.983
You should.

01:01:48.348 --> 01:01:49.449
Really.

01:01:52.982 --> 01:01:54.380
Good luck.

01:01:54.382 --> 01:01:55.948
Thanks.

01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:58.416
We haven't been
to the bar in a while.

01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:05.249
I've been having dinner
with Jonathan.

01:02:07.416 --> 01:02:08.449
That's good.

01:02:14.248 --> 01:02:17.249
I'm really glad you two are
having dinner together again.

01:02:45.615 --> 01:02:48.313
Warden, I'm seeing
a lot of you lately.

01:02:48.315 --> 01:02:50.079
Thank you.

01:02:50.081 --> 01:02:53.014
Pretty soon, your wife will
be seeing a lot more of you.

01:02:53.016 --> 01:02:55.382
Oh, retirement will be
good for both of us.

01:02:57.415 --> 01:03:00.983
It's always during these times
that I see you around here.

01:03:03.583 --> 01:03:05.182
It's my 12th.

01:03:06.082 --> 01:03:11.016
Hey, have you been able
to talk with Woods?

01:03:12.115 --> 01:03:14.249
He's not really one
you talk to.

01:03:15.248 --> 01:03:18.050
I'm just trying to let
him go at his own pace.

01:03:18.649 --> 01:03:21.414
Well, keep trying,
if you can.

01:03:21.416 --> 01:03:24.984
It just... He has
shut down completely.

01:03:26.248 --> 01:03:30.380
Warden, you know a lot of
these guys that come in here

01:03:30.382 --> 01:03:32.282
aren't very religious.

01:03:34.016 --> 01:03:36.180
These services are
really the only time

01:03:36.182 --> 01:03:41.981
they can scream and holler
and get all that stuff out.

01:03:41.983 --> 01:03:44.016
Even if it's through
a gospel song.

01:03:45.316 --> 01:03:48.246
Sometimes when I try
to talk to Woods,

01:03:48.248 --> 01:03:51.182
he just screams and hollers
like the rest of them.

01:03:53.582 --> 01:03:56.115
If it were up to me,
I'd stay.

01:03:57.016 --> 01:03:59.450
I've always felt drawn
to this kind of work.

01:04:01.081 --> 01:04:03.079
But my wife started
seeing things in me

01:04:03.081 --> 01:04:04.982
those nights
I'd come home.

01:04:07.249 --> 01:04:10.282
I think Victor Jimenez
was the last straw.

01:04:14.416 --> 01:04:15.983
I can't sleep.

01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:25.383
You are gonna
enjoy retirement.

01:04:26.282 --> 01:04:27.383
I think so.

01:04:29.482 --> 01:04:33.350
Warden, um, I'll try
to talk to him again.

01:04:34.949 --> 01:04:36.250
Thanks, David.

01:05:07.383 --> 01:05:11.346
So, how was it
with Philip and Danisha?

01:05:13.181 --> 01:05:15.349
Well, my students
are great.

01:05:16.615 --> 01:05:18.216
I'm gonna miss them.

01:05:23.949 --> 01:05:26.116
I talked to Chris
today at the firm.

01:05:26.483 --> 01:05:27.851
And, uh...

01:05:31.082 --> 01:05:34.316
we're in a good place
financially for this to happen.

01:05:35.282 --> 01:05:36.450
On my end.

01:05:39.215 --> 01:05:41.851
You do what you need to do
when you're ready.

01:05:56.981 --> 01:06:00.382
Why are you so sure
now is the time?

01:06:03.082 --> 01:06:05.217
Because I felt
like I was shrinking.

01:06:06.948 --> 01:06:12.015
I've been giving more to my
students than to myself, than to us.

01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:18.850
And I'm sorry.

01:06:20.583 --> 01:06:24.350
Bernadine,
I see you at night...

01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:30.250
and I don't think you wanna live
in fragments anymore either.

01:06:33.116 --> 01:06:36.216
I think you wanna be whole.

01:06:45.616 --> 01:06:49.250
Even if it's not with me,
I think you wanna be whole.

01:07:18.181 --> 01:07:19.383
I want...

01:07:20.516 --> 01:07:26.316
I want us...
to be whole again.

01:07:41.116 --> 01:07:42.613
When did you
find out?

01:07:42.615 --> 01:07:44.047
About a week ago.

01:07:44.049 --> 01:07:46.950
- She's coming today, yeah?
- Yep.

01:07:47.649 --> 01:07:49.680
She... She wouldn't
have sent the photo,

01:07:49.682 --> 01:07:52.247
she... she wouldn't
be coming to see me

01:07:52.249 --> 01:07:54.249
if she didn't want us
to be a family.

01:07:55.315 --> 01:07:57.915
This is...
This is a good sign.

01:07:58.583 --> 01:08:00.050
I feel it.

01:08:00.515 --> 01:08:01.949
I really do.

01:08:03.383 --> 01:08:04.883
Mm-hmm.

01:08:05.515 --> 01:08:07.850
This is a good sign.

01:08:14.282 --> 01:08:15.316
Say it.

01:08:18.082 --> 01:08:21.979
Why'd she wait until now
to talk to you?

01:08:21.981 --> 01:08:25.180
Why is she
just seeing you now?

01:08:25.182 --> 01:08:29.212
After all the things that you've
been going through, Anthony,

01:08:29.215 --> 01:08:31.413
you don't need
any more disappointments.

01:08:31.416 --> 01:08:33.212
Any more?

01:08:33.215 --> 01:08:35.113
Then you don't think
they'll give me clemency?

01:08:35.115 --> 01:08:36.647
Well, that's what
we're fighting for.

01:08:36.649 --> 01:08:38.014
You don't think
that'll happen?

01:08:38.015 --> 01:08:39.514
I don't know
what'll happen.

01:08:39.515 --> 01:08:42.947
I'm just saying that we should
keep our expectations realistic

01:08:42.948 --> 01:08:44.115
for everything.

01:08:47.249 --> 01:08:49.249
This is why you're retiring.

01:08:50.515 --> 01:08:51.982
You're giving up.

01:08:52.981 --> 01:08:55.613
I am not giving up.
I am not giving up.

01:08:55.616 --> 01:08:58.113
But I've been around
a long time.

01:08:58.115 --> 01:09:01.147
And... I just don't think
one can find hope

01:09:01.149 --> 01:09:02.647
in other people's decisions.

01:09:02.649 --> 01:09:05.082
You've given me hope.

01:09:06.247 --> 01:09:08.279
Marty, you...

01:09:08.282 --> 01:09:10.447
- Let's go.
- I got... I got a family now.

01:09:10.448 --> 01:09:12.680
I got a... Look.

01:09:12.682 --> 01:09:15.246
I got a family,
and that gives me hope.

01:09:15.247 --> 01:09:16.250
Let's go.

01:09:17.215 --> 01:09:21.149
Hey, I can't do this
on my own anymore.

01:09:21.915 --> 01:09:23.247
I... I can't.

01:09:23.249 --> 01:09:25.983
I... I can't do this
on my own.

01:09:47.982 --> 01:09:50.214
- What do we want?
- Respect for life.

01:09:50.216 --> 01:09:52.613
- When do we want it?
- Here and now.

01:09:52.616 --> 01:09:54.947
- What do we want?
- Respect for life.

01:09:54.949 --> 01:09:56.980
- When do want it?
- Here and now.

01:09:56.982 --> 01:09:59.147
- What do we want?
- Respect for life.

01:09:59.149 --> 01:10:01.347
- When do we want it?
- Here and now.

01:10:01.349 --> 01:10:03.647
- What do we want?
- Respect for life.

01:10:03.649 --> 01:10:05.946
- When do we want it?
- Here and now.

01:10:05.948 --> 01:10:08.046
- I am...
- Anthony Woods.

01:10:08.048 --> 01:10:10.079
- We are...
- Anthony Woods.

01:10:10.081 --> 01:10:12.113
- I am...
- Anthony Woods.

01:10:12.115 --> 01:10:14.147
- We are...
- Anthony Woods.

01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:16.114
- I am...
- Anthony Woods.

01:10:16.116 --> 01:10:18.113
- We are...
- Anthony Woods.

01:10:18.115 --> 01:10:20.213
- I am...
- Anthony Woods.

01:10:20.215 --> 01:10:22.414
- We are...
- Anthony Woods.

01:10:22.416 --> 01:10:24.446
- I am...
- Anthony Woods.

01:10:24.448 --> 01:10:26.514
- We are...
- Anthony Woods.

01:10:26.516 --> 01:10:28.513
- I am...
- Anthony Woods.

01:10:28.515 --> 01:10:30.514
- We are...
- Anthony Woods.

01:10:30.516 --> 01:10:32.580
- I am...
- Anthony Woods.

01:10:32.582 --> 01:10:34.547
- We are...
- Anthony Woods.

01:10:34.549 --> 01:10:36.646
- I am...
- Anthony Woods.

01:10:36.648 --> 01:10:38.947
- We are...
- Anthony Woods.

01:10:38.949 --> 01:10:40.647
- I am...
- Anthony Woods.

01:10:40.649 --> 01:10:42.481
- We are...
- Anthony Woods.

01:11:29.283 --> 01:11:31.082
Tony.

01:11:38.982 --> 01:11:43.382
You... You look, uh...

01:11:45.348 --> 01:11:47.115
You look the same.

01:12:16.548 --> 01:12:18.883
What made you agree
to see me?

01:12:21.415 --> 01:12:25.049
Because you're the most important
person in the world to me.

01:12:28.448 --> 01:12:32.281
I shouldn't have waited
so long to tell you.

01:12:32.283 --> 01:12:35.281
And I shouldn't have told
you the way that I did.

01:12:35.283 --> 01:12:38.646
But, Tony, that day that you
were arrested, I really...

01:12:38.648 --> 01:12:41.946
Just... Just don't.

01:12:41.948 --> 01:12:43.979
We don't need to talk
about that stuff.

01:12:43.981 --> 01:12:47.180
Tony, that day that,
uh, you were arrested...

01:12:47.182 --> 01:12:48.250
Stop.

01:12:52.449 --> 01:12:54.249
You're not listening to me.

01:12:56.282 --> 01:13:01.382
You're trying to explain yourself to
me, but I... I know.

01:13:02.547 --> 01:13:03.982
I know.

01:13:04.482 --> 01:13:07.016
I... I know you feel sorry.

01:13:07.547 --> 01:13:10.383
I know you feel guilty.

01:13:11.348 --> 01:13:13.579
You fucked up.

01:13:13.581 --> 01:13:17.546
I just... I just...
I don't wanna hear any of that right now.

01:13:17.548 --> 01:13:23.250
Talking about the past isn't
gonna help save my life, E.

01:13:25.582 --> 01:13:27.250
You're here now.

01:13:28.081 --> 01:13:31.183
I'm here now with you.

01:13:33.048 --> 01:13:34.882
And I still love you.

01:13:37.348 --> 01:13:39.015
And I forgive you.

01:13:42.316 --> 01:13:45.016
It's taken so long,

01:13:46.316 --> 01:13:50.913
but I can't live
with this... this...

01:13:50.915 --> 01:13:53.149
I can't hate anymore.

01:13:55.316 --> 01:13:57.983
Not with what they're
about to do to me.

01:14:02.049 --> 01:14:03.849
I need to see him.

01:14:05.981 --> 01:14:07.982
I need to see him.

01:14:09.981 --> 01:14:13.046
Okay? I... I just
need to see him.

01:14:13.048 --> 01:14:15.914
We can just... We can, um...

01:14:15.916 --> 01:14:19.379
Wow. We could be together,
you know?

01:14:19.381 --> 01:14:21.579
Just be like... like...

01:14:21.581 --> 01:14:23.949
I can have a family again,
you know?

01:14:27.249 --> 01:14:28.283
Tony,

01:14:30.182 --> 01:14:32.014
that night
that they arrested you,

01:14:32.016 --> 01:14:33.379
I was pregnant and I had
to make a decision.

01:14:33.381 --> 01:14:35.146
Did you not hear everything
I just said, Evette?

01:14:35.148 --> 01:14:36.679
You were about to be
convicted of a murder

01:14:36.681 --> 01:14:39.380
- and I was barely out of high school.
- I told you I don't...

01:14:39.382 --> 01:14:41.281
There was someone else that wanted
to marry me. I was scared, okay?

01:14:41.283 --> 01:14:43.047
I don't need to hear this shit no more.
I know you're sorry.

01:14:43.049 --> 01:14:44.348
I'm not sorry.

01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:50.080
I wrote those letters
to explain why I left

01:14:50.082 --> 01:14:52.247
and why I wasn't
at your trial

01:14:52.249 --> 01:14:55.147
and why I couldn't tell
you about the pregnancy,

01:14:55.149 --> 01:14:58.380
but I am not sorry
for any of it.

01:14:58.382 --> 01:15:02.412
I'm not sorry for choosing
the better option.

01:15:02.414 --> 01:15:05.146
And I'm not sorry for
choosing to leave you

01:15:05.148 --> 01:15:06.380
when you needed me
the most

01:15:06.382 --> 01:15:09.916
so that I could build
a life for myself.

01:15:11.481 --> 01:15:17.115
And I'm not sorry for choosing
the well-being of my son...

01:15:22.248 --> 01:15:23.449
our son...

01:15:24.981 --> 01:15:26.915
over you...

01:15:28.581 --> 01:15:30.182
over us.

01:15:31.648 --> 01:15:35.249
Because I would make those
choices again if I had to.

01:15:37.116 --> 01:15:41.349
I wanted you to know the truth
about Michael before the...

01:15:50.548 --> 01:15:52.416
before the execution.

01:15:57.248 --> 01:15:58.316
I love you.

01:15:59.415 --> 01:16:02.379
And there is no reason for
you to still believe that,

01:16:02.381 --> 01:16:04.982
but I... I know you do.

01:16:06.181 --> 01:16:11.512
You, Anthony Woods,
are loved.

01:16:11.514 --> 01:16:13.580
People are fighting
for you.

01:16:13.582 --> 01:16:18.083
People are doing what I couldn't
do, and I own that.

01:16:19.448 --> 01:16:20.883
I ran.

01:16:22.215 --> 01:16:23.381
And...

01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:29.448
I have chosen a life
of barely existing.

01:16:30.348 --> 01:16:32.316
And I love my son.

01:16:33.681 --> 01:16:36.281
And I'm happy that
he has a home...

01:16:37.515 --> 01:16:40.180
and a good education

01:16:40.182 --> 01:16:43.047
and more opportunities
than you and...

01:16:43.049 --> 01:16:46.016
you and I have ever had.

01:16:46.681 --> 01:16:49.114
But when I die,

01:16:49.116 --> 01:16:52.646
I will only be a memory
to a handful of people.

01:16:52.648 --> 01:16:54.949
But when you die...

01:16:58.081 --> 01:17:02.915
your name will live on
for lifetimes.

01:17:21.649 --> 01:17:23.381
I'm sorry.

01:17:27.049 --> 01:17:29.249
Tony, I'm sorry.

01:17:33.214 --> 01:17:35.983
You can see
your son, okay?

01:17:38.382 --> 01:17:39.416
Babe.

01:17:58.148 --> 01:18:00.050
Come on, Woods.

01:18:30.381 --> 01:18:33.112
<i>I'm here with Anthony's defense
attorney, Marty Lumetta,</i>

01:18:33.114 --> 01:18:35.512
<i>who says it's not over yet
and that his team</i>

01:18:35.514 --> 01:18:38.579
<i>has already asked for a reprieve
from the governor's office,</i>

01:18:38.581 --> 01:18:42.014
<i>whose decision could override
that of the parole board.</i>

01:18:42.016 --> 01:18:43.946
<i>Mr. Lumetta, thank you
for joining us today.</i>

01:18:43.948 --> 01:18:46.213
- <i>I know how extremely busy you are.</i>
- <i>Sure.</i>

01:18:46.215 --> 01:18:49.546
<i>These next 24 hours
are crucial for you,</i>

01:18:49.548 --> 01:18:51.413
<i>your team,
and of course, Anthony.</i>

01:18:51.415 --> 01:18:54.345
<i>Can you explain to us
what happens next?</i>

01:18:54.347 --> 01:18:56.579
<i>You say it's not over.</i>

01:18:56.581 --> 01:18:58.613
<i>Oh, well, no.
It's not over.</i>

01:18:58.615 --> 01:19:01.646
<i>We've asked for a reprieve
from the governor's office</i>

01:19:01.648 --> 01:19:03.545
<i>considering
what happened.</i>

01:19:03.547 --> 01:19:06.646
<i>What happened during
the state's last execution,</i>

01:19:06.648 --> 01:19:09.346
<i>we're hoping that would
certainly be reason enough</i>

01:19:09.348 --> 01:19:12.380
<i>to hold off any further
actions regarding Anthony</i>

01:19:12.382 --> 01:19:16.078
<i>until we get more answers
about what happened last time.</i>

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.245
<i>And how is he doing?</i>

01:19:18.247 --> 01:19:20.246
<i>Well, his spirits
are up.</i>

01:19:20.248 --> 01:19:24.546
<i>We're heartened by all
the public support.</i>

01:19:24.548 --> 01:19:28.680
<i>Um, Anthony is actually
quite moved by it all.</i>

01:19:28.682 --> 01:19:34.982
<i>I... I definitely see in him
more hope these last few days.</i>

01:19:35.681 --> 01:19:38.013
- <i>Thank you, Mr. Lumetta.</i>
- <i>My pleasure.</i>

01:19:38.015 --> 01:19:39.545
<i>The controversy
surrounding this...</i>

01:19:39.547 --> 01:19:41.113
Do you think he did it?

01:19:41.115 --> 01:19:42.646
<i>...has reignited debates
about the death penalty</i>

01:19:42.648 --> 01:19:45.178
<i>and whether or not it is an
effective form of punishment</i>

01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:47.382
<i>within our criminal
justice system.</i>

01:19:53.016 --> 01:19:55.950
I wasn't sure you really
wanted to hear my opinion.

01:20:00.048 --> 01:20:04.512
I don't know if he killed
the guy or not,

01:20:04.514 --> 01:20:05.915
but...

01:20:07.415 --> 01:20:10.850
it's hard watching what's
about to happen to that guy.

01:20:22.949 --> 01:20:27.382
Woods has a son.
His name is Michael.

01:20:30.247 --> 01:20:33.983
Michael doesn't know
Woods is his dad.

01:20:38.081 --> 01:20:40.883
Woods just found out
Michael was his.

01:20:49.181 --> 01:20:51.315
She's supposed to
bring Michael...

01:20:53.247 --> 01:20:56.248
over to meet Woods
for the first time tomorrow.

01:21:03.649 --> 01:21:08.380
His lawyers keep
filing these appeals,

01:21:08.382 --> 01:21:10.215
and they all get denied.

01:21:14.282 --> 01:21:19.381
I ask him
where he wants to be buried,

01:21:20.348 --> 01:21:25.883
what he wants for
his bullshit last meal.

01:21:29.648 --> 01:21:31.313
And he's still gonna die,

01:21:31.315 --> 01:21:36.914
just no matter what I do
or don't do.

01:21:36.916 --> 01:21:38.115
He's...

01:21:39.948 --> 01:21:41.216
He's dead.

01:21:41.916 --> 01:21:43.449
Just dead.

01:21:44.382 --> 01:21:47.949
They're all dead.
All of them, all of them.

01:21:49.515 --> 01:21:50.982
Twelve.

01:21:54.947 --> 01:21:56.248
I'm sorry.

01:21:58.515 --> 01:21:59.913
Why are you apologizing?

01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:02.112
I'm... sorry.

01:22:02.114 --> 01:22:05.046
I'm trying
to be supportive.

01:22:05.048 --> 01:22:07.013
I'm trying
to understand you.

01:22:07.015 --> 01:22:10.412
I just don't...
I can't be touched right now.

01:22:10.414 --> 01:22:11.448
Jonathan.

01:22:14.115 --> 01:22:16.850
You can't understand.

01:22:18.548 --> 01:22:21.982
That's the problem.
I don't know how to fix it.

01:22:24.414 --> 01:22:28.248
Because you can't know
what it's like to look...

01:22:29.515 --> 01:22:34.280
at these people every day,
to talk to them every day.

01:22:34.282 --> 01:22:39.349
Look in their faces,
look in their families' faces.

01:22:41.115 --> 01:22:45.413
You can't know that because
you don't do what I do,

01:22:45.415 --> 01:22:47.182
what I have to do.

01:22:49.447 --> 01:22:52.312
I just need you to know that.
That's it.

01:22:52.314 --> 01:22:53.348
Just...

01:22:57.581 --> 01:22:59.448
I just need you
to know that...

01:23:03.348 --> 01:23:05.149
I am alone...

01:23:06.681 --> 01:23:08.949
and nobody can fix it.

01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:16.281
Bernadine.

01:23:20.381 --> 01:23:22.380
<i>Find your new home rental.</i>

01:23:22.382 --> 01:23:25.316
<i>Did you know you can hire
a real estate agent...</i>

01:23:37.247 --> 01:23:39.145
Yes.

01:23:39.147 --> 01:23:42.182
All the equipment has
been checked and cleared.

01:23:43.482 --> 01:23:44.849
Right.

01:23:45.649 --> 01:23:47.115
Okay.

01:23:49.114 --> 01:23:51.381
When will I get my paperwork?

01:23:53.281 --> 01:23:54.315
Okay.

01:23:55.648 --> 01:23:57.114
Yes.

01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:02.114
All right, thank you, sir.
Thank you.

01:24:04.282 --> 01:24:05.448
Right. Goodbye.

01:24:45.247 --> 01:24:48.416
Evette, this is
Bernadine Williams.

01:24:49.415 --> 01:24:50.449
Um...

01:24:51.382 --> 01:24:52.982
give me a call.

01:24:54.981 --> 01:24:56.249
Thank you.

01:25:11.114 --> 01:25:13.115
They should be here soon.

01:25:15.981 --> 01:25:18.380
I'll give you 45 minutes.

01:25:18.382 --> 01:25:19.849
Okay?

01:25:21.381 --> 01:25:22.849
Thank you.

01:26:19.247 --> 01:26:20.382
Water?

01:26:23.915 --> 01:26:25.182
Thank you.

01:26:26.515 --> 01:26:27.982
You're welcome.

01:27:19.047 --> 01:27:20.979
Yes?

01:27:20.981 --> 01:27:23.646
I'll call him back as soon
as I get to my office.

01:27:23.648 --> 01:27:27.216
Hey. Has Evette Wilkinson
showed up yet?

01:27:28.347 --> 01:27:29.416
Are you sure?

01:27:31.514 --> 01:27:32.914
Okay.

01:27:57.214 --> 01:27:58.315
Mr. Woods.

01:28:03.115 --> 01:28:04.849
I'm sorry.

01:29:08.513 --> 01:29:09.881
Um...

01:29:11.114 --> 01:29:13.178
Bernadine Williams here.

01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:14.216
Um...

01:29:17.314 --> 01:29:21.148
we need you
to call over here.

01:29:21.647 --> 01:29:25.014
I need you to call,
Evette.

01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:30.448
Okay. Just call.

01:29:44.247 --> 01:29:47.082
There's still time, Anthony.

01:29:48.513 --> 01:29:54.511
Clemency has hap... has happened
right up until the last minutes,

01:29:54.513 --> 01:29:56.112
the last seconds.

01:29:56.114 --> 01:30:00.512
We have our assistant glued
to the phone, standing by.

01:30:00.514 --> 01:30:03.848
As soon the governor calls,
we're gonna jump into action.

01:30:12.248 --> 01:30:13.949
You know what?

01:30:16.580 --> 01:30:19.181
You know,
all the people want...

01:30:21.547 --> 01:30:25.949
no matter who they are, no matter where
they've been, no matter what they've done,

01:30:27.381 --> 01:30:32.148
all we want is to be seen
and to be heard.

01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:34.182
That's it.

01:30:37.247 --> 01:30:40.512
That's what this whole fucked up
thing on this earth is all about,

01:30:40.514 --> 01:30:42.679
to be seen and to be heard.

01:30:42.681 --> 01:30:44.981
And for the last
few weeks, Anthony,

01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:48.381
people have seen you,

01:30:50.414 --> 01:30:52.949
people are listening to you.

01:30:56.348 --> 01:30:59.182
I know it's hard for you
to believe, I know that.

01:31:00.281 --> 01:31:03.315
But you do not have
to be alone.

01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:10.478
It is not over.

01:31:16.081 --> 01:31:18.249
It's not over.

01:31:26.647 --> 01:31:28.114
Chaplain.

01:31:40.481 --> 01:31:44.181
I'm gonna be right here, Anthony.
I ain't going anywhere.

01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:47.380
I ain't going anywhere.

01:31:48.414 --> 01:31:49.882
Okay?

01:31:51.381 --> 01:31:53.216
I will be right here.

01:32:58.381 --> 01:32:59.646
Scarlett?

01:32:59.648 --> 01:33:00.945
Ma'am.

01:33:00.947 --> 01:33:02.344
Mrs. Collins?

01:33:02.346 --> 01:33:05.914
Miss Williams, are you
expecting any delays?

01:33:07.181 --> 01:33:09.079
Someone from
the governor's office

01:33:09.081 --> 01:33:12.381
could call up to the last
second to call it off.

01:33:13.313 --> 01:33:16.948
But... you think that's
gonna happen this time?

01:33:18.215 --> 01:33:20.149
No, I don't...
I don't think so.

01:33:20.681 --> 01:33:22.982
But, you know,
you never know.

01:33:23.547 --> 01:33:26.149
Oh, good Lord.

01:33:35.915 --> 01:33:37.315
Thank you.

01:33:40.380 --> 01:33:43.380
Um, I'll let you know
when it's time.

01:34:02.047 --> 01:34:04.081
May I share something
with you?

01:34:21.914 --> 01:34:25.014
"For I am certain that
neither death nor life,

01:34:26.314 --> 01:34:29.149
neither angels
nor heavenly powers,

01:34:30.647 --> 01:34:33.380
neither present nor future,

01:34:34.246 --> 01:34:37.082
neither the world above
nor below, in fact,

01:34:38.246 --> 01:34:40.448
nothing at all
in all creation,

01:34:41.948 --> 01:34:44.849
is able to separate us
from the love of God."

01:34:56.680 --> 01:34:58.082
Anthony.

01:34:59.413 --> 01:35:02.848
That love of God is seen
everywhere around you.

01:35:04.346 --> 01:35:06.949
The lawyers who've
been fighting for you.

01:35:08.247 --> 01:35:11.211
The people who've been shouting
your name every single day

01:35:11.213 --> 01:35:13.214
right outside this prison.

01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:19.248
They're gonna
keep on loving you,

01:35:21.047 --> 01:35:23.181
no matter how this ends.

01:36:27.513 --> 01:36:28.982
Warden?

01:36:34.014 --> 01:36:36.347
We heard back
from the governor's office.

01:39:06.046 --> 01:39:08.414
Would you like
to make a final statement?

01:39:19.481 --> 01:39:22.849
First, I'd like to address
the Collins family.

01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:28.044
I just wanna let
you all know that,

01:39:28.046 --> 01:39:30.214
despite this situation,

01:39:31.648 --> 01:39:33.912
I know that you all
are still convinced

01:39:33.914 --> 01:39:35.981
that I killed your father,

01:39:38.114 --> 01:39:42.380
your son, your brother,

01:39:44.146 --> 01:39:48.148
but I didn't shoot
your family member.

01:39:50.147 --> 01:39:53.280
I'm so sorry for your loss.

01:39:54.546 --> 01:39:58.447
I really am, sincerely.

01:40:03.946 --> 01:40:07.247
To all the people
that supported me,

01:40:10.979 --> 01:40:12.347
I'm truly grateful.

01:40:14.980 --> 01:40:16.515
Even when your support

01:40:17.613 --> 01:40:21.981
and your love wasn't clear to me, I...
I still felt it,

01:40:25.214 --> 01:40:28.048
and no one can
take that away from me.

01:40:33.547 --> 01:40:35.248
And to my family...

01:40:39.481 --> 01:40:41.048
I love you, Ma.

01:40:44.613 --> 01:40:46.913
I'll see you soon.

01:40:51.113 --> 01:40:54.347
And to all the people that
are about to take my life,

01:40:57.147 --> 01:40:59.847
may God have mercy
on your soul.

01:43:48.446 --> 01:43:49.913
Warden?

01:43:52.914 --> 01:43:54.148
Warden?

01:43:59.180 --> 01:44:02.112
Time of death,
11:23 p.m.

01:44:15.446 --> 01:44:16.913
Warden.

01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:22.248
Bernadine.

01:44:31.147 --> 01:44:34.881
Go ahead and record the
time of death as 11:23 p.m.

01:44:58.214 --> 01:45:00.112
Disconnect the room.

01:45:00.114 --> 01:45:02.248
Take his body
to the exam room.

01:45:12.579 --> 01:45:15.247
Are you here, Bernadine?

01:45:15.914 --> 01:45:17.181
Are you here?

01:46:24.101 --> 01:46:29.101
