00:01.500 --> 00:03.540
Previously on "How To Get Away
With Murder"...

00:03.540 --> 00:04.670
Why are you all lying?

00:04.670 --> 00:05.750
You're listed as Jane Doe
in all the paperwork,

00:05.750 --> 00:07.210
so no one will know.

00:07.210 --> 00:09.380
Claire, hi.
It's Tegan Price.

00:09.380 --> 00:10.880
I wanted to meet up
if you have time.

00:10.880 --> 00:13.120
Gabriel: I screwed up.
They found out who I am.

00:13.120 --> 00:15.170
Mr. Maddox, when was the last
time you saw D.A. Miller?

00:15.170 --> 00:16.170
Laurel:
Do you know what happens

00:16.170 --> 00:17.500
to infants
when they see trauma?

00:17.500 --> 00:20.540
He could have PTSD for the rest
of his life, Bonnie.

00:20.540 --> 00:22.620
I did it.
For me.

00:22.620 --> 00:24.120
So don't even think
about leaving us.

00:24.120 --> 00:26.000
-Nate has a plan.
-What is it?

00:26.000 --> 00:27.620
The Governor
killed Miller.

00:27.620 --> 00:30.250
We just got
the DNA results back.

00:30.250 --> 00:31.920
Someone manufactured
those positive results.

00:31.920 --> 00:33.170
Miller.

00:33.170 --> 00:34.500
We have
someone in custody

00:34.500 --> 00:36.380
who we hope will shed light
on Miller's involvement.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.250
Gabriel:
Professor Keating?

00:41.250 --> 00:43.040
I think
I need a lawyer.

00:43.040 --> 00:44.540
I'm hoping that's you.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.620
Hi.

01:21.330 --> 01:22.420
-What did they arrest him for?

01:22.420 --> 01:23.500
I'm gonna go find out --

01:23.500 --> 01:25.120
But you're not actually
gonna represent him.

01:25.120 --> 01:27.580
Well, he's already told the FBI
agents that I'm his attorney.

01:27.580 --> 01:28.790
Yeah,
because it's a setup.

01:30.620 --> 01:33.290
How do I know you're not
working with the FBI?
What?

01:33.290 --> 01:36.170
You could be trying to get me
to say something on a wire.
No.

01:37.380 --> 01:38.420
No wire.

01:39.830 --> 01:42.170
Please, I don't
have anyone else.

01:43.500 --> 01:45.420
Meeting with him would
only prove how close
you are with him.

01:45.420 --> 01:47.420
-I'm his professor --
-It's the FBI --

01:47.420 --> 01:48.920
they clearly know
that he's Sam's son.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.750
Exactly, and this is them
just starting to gather evidence

01:50.750 --> 01:52.080
to take us all down.

01:53.170 --> 01:55.000
They ask you
anything about Sam?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.460
No, they never
mentioned him.

01:56.460 --> 01:57.960
So they didn't ask you
anything about me?

01:57.960 --> 01:59.170
No, they just
wanted to know

01:59.170 --> 02:00.580
if I saw Nate with Miller
at the wedding.

02:00.580 --> 02:02.330
Did you?

02:02.330 --> 02:04.540
No. And that's what
I told them.

02:04.540 --> 02:06.170
So I have no idea
why I'm here.

02:07.620 --> 02:09.750
All he's ever done
is lie to us, Annalise.

02:09.750 --> 02:12.080
So more reason for me to go
there to see if you're right.

02:12.080 --> 02:14.170
-And if we are?
-Then you all get gold stars.

02:14.170 --> 02:15.620
-In prison.
-Okay, uh,

02:15.620 --> 02:17.080
I know what we do, right?
Gabriel was at the wedding,

02:17.080 --> 02:19.170
so we say he killed Miller.
-For what reason?

02:19.170 --> 02:21.170
We'll figure it
out later.

02:21.170 --> 02:23.620
Do nothing until
you hear from me.

02:26.420 --> 02:27.960
You're not
making any sense.

02:27.960 --> 02:30.420
-None of this is making sense.
-They arrested you for a reason.

02:30.420 --> 02:32.420
I think you know why.
You're just not telling me.

02:32.420 --> 02:33.790
I'm telling you
everything I know.

02:37.120 --> 02:38.670
I'm out.

02:38.670 --> 02:40.460
-Why?
-Because I don't believe you.

02:40.460 --> 02:42.670
Maybe I never should've.
Lesson learned.

02:42.670 --> 02:43.670
Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

02:46.670 --> 02:48.380
I was talking to Miller
before he went missing.

02:55.500 --> 02:58.540
He reached out to me shortly
after I got into your class.

02:58.540 --> 03:00.460
He said that his old boss
was investigating you

03:00.460 --> 03:02.210
and that he needed me
to help find out more.

03:03.750 --> 03:05.250
He said he would help me
find out what happened to Sam.

03:05.250 --> 03:06.580
It's the only reason
I agreed.

03:06.580 --> 03:08.290
What'd the two of you
find out?
Nothing.

03:08.290 --> 03:10.210
That's why we barely
even talked, honestly.

03:12.420 --> 03:14.210
So I was right.
You were lying to me.

03:14.210 --> 03:16.830
Because I knew you wouldn't
help me if I told you.

03:16.830 --> 03:20.000
Look, I obviously can't
call my mom, all right? So...

03:20.000 --> 03:21.670
Please.

03:21.670 --> 03:23.080
Don't leave me
in here alone.

03:35.210 --> 03:37.960
How did you not know that
Miller was investigating me?
Because it's not true.

03:37.960 --> 03:40.290
Why would Gabriel
lie about that?
For a million reasons.

03:40.290 --> 03:41.960
We don't know him,
Annalise.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.120
Well, you didn't know
your boyfriend, either.
That's very clear now.

03:44.120 --> 03:45.580
When did Gabriel say
they started talking?
It doesn't matter --

03:45.580 --> 03:47.120
It could've been recent --
Or it could've been

03:47.120 --> 03:48.500
before you started
dating the man!

03:48.500 --> 03:49.920
No. He was there for me
during Julie --

03:49.920 --> 03:52.670
He was working you
that whole time.
According to Gabriel!

03:52.670 --> 03:54.250
Well, I believe him.
You believed
the Governor, too.

03:54.250 --> 03:55.250
How'd that turn out?

03:59.460 --> 04:00.790
I got played,
damn straight.

04:00.790 --> 04:03.040
But so did you.
So let him go, Bonnie.

04:03.040 --> 04:04.380
It's time.
You hear me?

04:04.380 --> 04:06.500
Hey, hey.
This is good.

04:06.500 --> 04:07.920
We can use Gabriel.

04:07.920 --> 04:09.620
-How?
-Get him to feed something

04:09.620 --> 04:11.540
to the FBI that links
Miller to the Governor.

04:11.540 --> 04:13.460
We have no proof
that they worked together.

04:13.460 --> 04:16.210
That was just an assumption that
you both made this whole time.

04:16.210 --> 04:18.000
You want us to trust
your gut on Gabriel?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.580
Well, then you have
to trust mine on this.

04:24.250 --> 04:28.040
Find something that points them
to the Governor --

04:28.040 --> 04:30.170
otherwise,
the FBI hangs us all.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.920
Thanks for meeting.

04:45.920 --> 04:48.380
I know you're probably slammed
with the Miller investigation.

04:48.380 --> 04:51.040
Isn't that
why you called?

04:51.040 --> 04:52.540
-What?
-The D.A.'s missing,

04:52.540 --> 04:56.330
probably dead, and you work with
Annalise Keating now, so...

04:56.330 --> 04:58.750
What's Annalise
have to do with Miller?

04:58.750 --> 05:00.500
That's what I was
hoping you'd tell me.

05:04.670 --> 05:08.710
I assumed Jorge Castillo
was behind this, like Denver.

05:08.710 --> 05:09.920
That's why
I called you.

05:09.920 --> 05:12.250
We haven't found anything
to support that theory.

05:12.250 --> 05:13.790
So now you suspect
Annalise?

05:13.790 --> 05:16.620
-I didn't say she was a suspect.
-Then what are you saying?

05:16.620 --> 05:18.710
That I'm open
to all possibilities.

05:18.710 --> 05:20.460
And since you work
with the woman,

05:20.460 --> 05:22.580
perhaps you could
offer the FBI some help.

05:24.580 --> 05:27.210
I helped you take down
Jorge Castillo.

05:27.210 --> 05:29.040
And we protected you,
just like we can here.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.750
Protect me
from what?

05:33.750 --> 05:35.920
Just call me if you notice
anything out of the ordinary.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.170
Okay?

05:40.540 --> 05:41.830
Of course.

05:58.250 --> 06:00.290
-Sign.
-You sure?

06:00.290 --> 06:02.580
Like you gave me
a choice.

06:02.580 --> 06:04.460
We have court
in an hour.

06:04.460 --> 06:06.880
We'll find out what they're
charging you with there.

06:06.880 --> 06:08.580
Connor:
I'm thinking the charge could
be obstruction of justice --

06:08.580 --> 06:11.580
Michaela: For what?
Lying about the extent of
his relationship with Miller.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.330
Be honest.
Did you contact Miller,

06:13.330 --> 06:15.710
or did he
contact you?

06:15.710 --> 06:18.380
He contacted me.
You swear you had
nothing to do

06:18.380 --> 06:19.830
with his disappearance?
Of course not.

06:19.830 --> 06:21.380
You were the last person
to call him

06:21.380 --> 06:22.580
on the night
of the wedding.

06:22.580 --> 06:24.710
The wedding we were all at,
so by that logic,

06:24.710 --> 06:26.460
you'd all be suspects
in his disappearance, too.

06:27.710 --> 06:29.080
Maybe they're making up
the charges.

06:29.080 --> 06:30.920
It's their way to force him
to be an informant --

06:30.920 --> 06:32.750
-Who's he informing on?
-Us.

06:32.750 --> 06:34.120
Are we really
talking about this here?

06:35.250 --> 06:37.670
Did you deny knowing
Sam was your father?

06:37.670 --> 06:39.250
-No.
-Are you sure?

06:39.250 --> 06:42.790
Because concealing information
is a felony under Title 18 --

06:42.790 --> 06:46.210
I swear they never directly
asked me about you or Sam.

06:46.210 --> 06:47.920
He had a go bag
with a fake I.D.

06:47.920 --> 06:49.500
Forgery is
a federal offense.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.790
It was a driver's license.
That's only a state crime.

06:51.790 --> 06:54.830
Why do you have a fake license?
-I carry it on me at protests --

06:54.830 --> 06:56.080
so that way,
if I got arrested,

06:56.080 --> 06:57.580
they'd book me
under a fake name.

06:57.580 --> 06:59.420
So if the Feds run
Mark Jackson's name,

06:59.420 --> 07:01.710
they're not gonna
find anything bad?

07:01.710 --> 07:03.380
Not bad enough for me
to be sitting here.

07:03.380 --> 07:05.500
Judge Horning:
Good morning. This is
the U.S. District Court,

07:05.500 --> 07:08.040
Eastern District
of Pennsylvania.

07:08.040 --> 07:09.420
First up
on the docket is

07:09.420 --> 07:12.290
the United States
v. Gabriel Maddox.

07:12.290 --> 07:14.500
Mr. Maddox,
will you please stand

07:14.500 --> 07:16.580
and face the charges
against you?

07:18.000 --> 07:21.920
Due to your actions on
the 13th of August in 2014

07:21.920 --> 07:23.880
in the county of
St. Louis, Missouri,

07:23.880 --> 07:25.580
the Federal Government
is charging you

07:25.580 --> 07:30.540
with one count of violating
Section 802 of the Patriot Act.

07:30.540 --> 07:32.120
-What the hell?
-Quiet.

07:32.120 --> 07:34.000
Your Honor, on what grounds
is the government throwing

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
this trumped-up charge
at my client?
What?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.040
Domestic terrorism.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.540
We will prove the extent

07:37.540 --> 07:38.620
of the defendant's
criminal actions at trial.

07:38.620 --> 07:41.380
You don't accuse
a law student of terrorism

07:41.380 --> 07:44.080
and then bury
the evidence until trial.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.500
Fine. The government's
happy to show the court

07:45.500 --> 07:47.580
just how legitimate
this charge is.

07:47.580 --> 07:49.880
Bordal: This photo
was taken by a reporter

07:49.880 --> 07:52.790
during the Ferguson protests
in 2014.

07:52.790 --> 07:55.120
FBI investigators were
only recently able

07:55.120 --> 07:57.830
to identify the depicted
individual as Gabriel Maddox.

07:57.830 --> 08:00.330
What's illegal about protesting
a police shooting, Your Honor?

08:00.330 --> 08:01.920
Protesting is legal.

08:01.920 --> 08:05.420
Attacking law enforcement
with a chemical agent is not.

08:05.420 --> 08:06.540
Annalise: This man
is wearing a mask.

08:06.540 --> 08:08.620
This could be
anyone, Judge.

08:08.620 --> 08:10.710
Further inculpatory evidence
will be presented

08:10.710 --> 08:12.960
once a trial date
has been set.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.290
Judge Horning: Very well.

08:14.290 --> 08:16.080
Due to the severe nature
of these allegations,

08:16.080 --> 08:17.540
I'm setting bail
at $1 million.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.880
Next case.

08:19.880 --> 08:22.790
The United States
v. Karl Jones.

08:22.790 --> 08:24.330
Will counsel from both sides...

08:24.330 --> 08:27.330
...please approach and announce
your presence for the record...

08:32.750 --> 08:34.920
Here we go.

08:34.920 --> 08:36.750
You should've called me
for help a long time ago.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.210
What's this?

08:38.210 --> 08:40.170
The call log
to Miller's burner phone.

08:41.670 --> 08:43.710
Oh, you found
Miller's burner number?

08:43.710 --> 08:45.880
Annalise got it
from Gabriel.

08:45.880 --> 08:47.460
Let's hope one of those calls
is to the Governor herself.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.460
Everyone's worried
about Bonnie losing it, but...

08:55.460 --> 08:56.500
maybe that's you.

08:59.380 --> 09:01.120
Take a page,
see who Miller was calling.

09:07.790 --> 09:09.460
Hey.

09:09.460 --> 09:12.040
Bonnie: They're charging
Gabriel with terrorism.

09:12.040 --> 09:14.380
-We heard.
-"We"?

09:14.380 --> 09:15.960
I'm with Nate.
Did he
find anything?

09:15.960 --> 09:17.920
Not yet.
Give me some time.

09:17.920 --> 09:20.750
We don't have much time
before Gabriel cracks.

09:22.500 --> 09:23.710
Annalise: Tell me
this is not you.

09:26.210 --> 09:27.290
You want me
to lie to you again?

09:28.920 --> 09:31.330
I was in the right.
Doesn't look that way.

09:31.330 --> 09:33.330
They started throwing
tear gas at us.

09:33.330 --> 09:35.380
People were screaming.
I-It was complete chaos.

09:35.380 --> 09:38.170
I reacted. That doesn't
make me a terrorist.

09:38.170 --> 09:40.170
They're trying
to turn you.

09:40.170 --> 09:42.420
Turn me?
Turn me against who?

09:42.420 --> 09:44.040
Know what? Write down
all your passwords.

09:44.040 --> 09:45.790
Phone,
computer, e-mails,

09:45.790 --> 09:47.750
and for your fake
identities, too.

09:47.750 --> 09:49.540
-Why?
-Because that prosecutor said

09:49.540 --> 09:51.880
that they have more proof
of your terrorist activity,

09:51.880 --> 09:54.460
so I'm guessing it's in some of
your old correspondence, too.

09:56.210 --> 09:58.120
Unless you're afraid
of what I'll find.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.620
-Was it him in the photo?
-Of course.

10:04.620 --> 10:06.120
So we let him
rot in jail?

10:06.120 --> 10:07.620
Unless you want
to rot with him.

10:07.620 --> 10:10.000
Here are his passwords.
-He just gave you these?

10:10.000 --> 10:11.830
Well, not all of us
have to hack.

10:11.830 --> 10:14.040
Go through his e-mails,
texts, posts that he wrote

10:14.040 --> 10:15.670
leading up
to the protest.

10:15.670 --> 10:17.170
Find anything that
the prosecution

10:17.170 --> 10:19.120
could construe
as terrorism.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.670
Call me at the office.
-Wait.

10:20.670 --> 10:23.000
You'll see Tegan
if you go to work.
Eventually, yes.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.750
She's gonna ask you why we were
shady about the Nate civil suit.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.330
Is now the best time to lie
to an FBI informant?

10:32.250 --> 10:33.830
You know what?
This was my mistake.

10:33.830 --> 10:35.790
I'll take care of it.
How?

10:35.790 --> 10:37.620
Don't worry.
I got this.

10:40.920 --> 10:43.500
Ms. Price?
Michaela!

10:43.500 --> 10:45.580
How absolutely lovely
to see you.

10:45.580 --> 10:47.460
You hate me again.
Are you surprised?

10:47.460 --> 10:48.710
Look --
You look.

10:48.710 --> 10:50.290
Because if you've
come tip-toeing in here

10:50.290 --> 10:52.290
to "make things right"
yet again --

10:52.290 --> 10:53.580
There's a reason we lied
about not filing

10:53.580 --> 10:56.250
the wrongful death
suit.

10:56.250 --> 10:59.670
The FBI is looking
into Nate.

10:59.670 --> 11:01.330
Why?
I don't know.
But it...

11:02.710 --> 11:04.250
...it might be
Miller's disappearance.

11:06.580 --> 11:08.120
Why would Nate
hurt Miller?

11:08.120 --> 11:09.210
Well, obviously,
he didn't.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.620
So you know something?

11:10.620 --> 11:12.670
They probably think
Miller losing the Inquest

11:12.670 --> 11:14.290
pissed off Nate.

11:14.290 --> 11:16.000
But that's why we didn't
want you filing the suit.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.040
So that Nate wouldn't draw
any more attention to himself.

11:24.830 --> 11:27.250
-What else is going on?
-Nothing.

11:27.250 --> 11:29.380
You swear on
your unborn children?

11:29.380 --> 11:31.250
On one adorable
future president child.

11:32.380 --> 11:35.210
Oh, good. I was just
coming to see Ms. Price,

11:35.210 --> 11:37.540
but maybe, uh,
you can fill me in.

11:37.540 --> 11:39.290
-A-About?
-Gabriel Maddox.

11:39.290 --> 11:40.880
Apparently, Annalise
is defending him

11:40.880 --> 11:42.210
on a terrorism charge.

11:43.620 --> 11:44.830
You wanna explain?

11:54.380 --> 11:56.880
-Tell me something good.
-It's all bad, if you ask me.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.960
-Shouldn't you be at work?
-When your boss is "missing,"

11:58.960 --> 12:01.080
they let you come and go
as you please.

12:01.080 --> 12:03.580
Here.
Gabriel used his alias

12:03.580 --> 12:06.330
to post the home addresses
of every cop in Ferguson.

12:06.330 --> 12:08.170
Could be construed
as a threat of violence.

12:08.170 --> 12:09.460
Oliver,
can you bury it?

12:09.460 --> 12:11.380
Sorry, I'm looking
at our wedding photos.

12:11.380 --> 12:13.040
-Focus.
-I'm checking to make sure

12:13.040 --> 12:14.880
there's no photos
of Miller with Nate.

12:14.880 --> 12:16.460
Oh, God. Like I need
any more problems.

12:16.460 --> 12:19.420
I got another one. I went
through Gabriel's text messages

12:19.420 --> 12:22.250
from the past few months.
-We need something from 2014.

12:22.250 --> 12:23.500
Just look.

12:25.790 --> 12:27.500
Told you.
All he does is lie.

12:33.580 --> 12:34.830
What's wrong?

12:38.330 --> 12:41.250
You've been talking
to your mother about me.

12:41.250 --> 12:42.540
No, I haven't.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.040
"How is she
treating you?

12:46.040 --> 12:48.170
Has she ever
asked you about me?"

12:49.710 --> 12:51.420
You said you were only looking
at messages around Ferguson --

12:51.420 --> 12:53.250
You have me
to blame for that.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.830
Well, those messages
aren't about you.

12:55.830 --> 12:57.080
They're about Michaela.

12:59.500 --> 13:00.960
-I swear.
-What?

13:00.960 --> 13:03.380
Who tells their mom about a girl
they've kissed four times?

13:03.380 --> 13:05.210
Me, okay?

13:05.210 --> 13:07.040
Look, if I'm happy,
she's happy.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.710
She just likes to hear
those kind of things.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.210
All right.

13:15.210 --> 13:16.540
Here.

13:18.830 --> 13:21.290
You have her number?
Just in case
I need to call her

13:21.290 --> 13:22.500
to tell her
what her son is up to.

13:23.830 --> 13:25.380
Prove you're not lying.

13:31.380 --> 13:33.500
Hey, Ma, it's me.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.920
Yeah, this is a friend's phone.
My phone's dead.

13:35.920 --> 13:39.000
I just --
I wanted to talk to you.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.080
I screwed up again.

13:42.710 --> 13:45.250
Yeah, with Michaela.

13:45.250 --> 13:48.210
Her birthday just passed,
and, um,

13:48.210 --> 13:49.330
I forgot.

13:49.330 --> 13:51.540
So she's pissed at me.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.170
Now, look, lady,

13:53.170 --> 13:54.960
I did not call you
for you to yell at me.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.460
I called
for a little love.

13:56.460 --> 13:57.420
Now, if you're not
gonna give me that,

13:57.420 --> 13:58.710
I can just hang up.

14:13.380 --> 14:15.580
Hey.
Hey.

14:15.580 --> 14:17.080
How you holding up?

14:17.080 --> 14:19.120
I'm just trying
to keep myself distracted

14:19.120 --> 14:21.040
until we know more.

14:22.960 --> 14:26.210
Do you know the name of Ron's
friend in the Governor's office?

14:26.210 --> 14:28.120
Why?
He mentioned he knew
someone there.

14:28.120 --> 14:30.540
I just never
heard the name.

14:30.540 --> 14:31.960
You think the Governor had
something to do with this?

14:31.960 --> 14:33.330
I don't know
what to think.

14:35.460 --> 14:37.250
No.

14:37.250 --> 14:38.750
No one from the Governor's
office ever called here.

14:38.750 --> 14:40.380
I would remember.

14:41.540 --> 14:45.080
God.
It's his mother again.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.380
Mrs. Miller, hi.

14:48.580 --> 14:51.670
Yes, I know.

14:51.670 --> 14:54.500
I promise I'll call
as soon as I hear anything.

14:54.500 --> 14:55.960
Are you getting
any sleep yet?

14:57.830 --> 14:59.080
Me neither.

15:01.920 --> 15:03.830
Woman: We're sorry.

15:03.830 --> 15:05.790
You have reached a number
that has been disconnected

15:05.790 --> 15:07.880
or is no longer in service.

15:07.880 --> 15:10.120
You hungry?

15:10.120 --> 15:11.540
I could run out
and get hoagies.

15:11.540 --> 15:13.080
Go home.
I'll finish up.

15:23.250 --> 15:25.750
What?

15:25.750 --> 15:28.080
You hate
what you did.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.500
I've been there.

15:29.500 --> 15:32.750
But there's
a world where...

15:32.750 --> 15:34.120
you don't
hate yourself so much.

15:37.080 --> 15:38.920
I mean,
no one takes up boxing

15:38.920 --> 15:40.540
if they don't have
some anger to get out.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.880
That's not why I box.
Or that's what
you tell yourself,

15:42.880 --> 15:44.960
that we're not animals.

15:44.960 --> 15:47.330
We got self-control.

15:47.330 --> 15:50.290
But people have been killing
people with their bare hands

15:50.290 --> 15:53.960
since the beginning
of time.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.210
It's in our nature.

15:59.790 --> 16:03.040
There's a world
where you're okay

16:03.040 --> 16:05.040
with what you did,
is all.

16:10.830 --> 16:12.170
Go home.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.710
That's Ron
at 15 months.

16:35.710 --> 16:38.170
Our dog Frisco
would never leave his side.

16:42.500 --> 16:43.580
Come and sit.

16:52.620 --> 16:54.460
Thank you.

17:05.120 --> 17:07.960
They haven't
told me much.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.380
I thought maybe
you might know something.

17:10.380 --> 17:13.120
So when
you called, I...

17:13.120 --> 17:15.670
They're not telling me
much, either.

17:24.750 --> 17:27.210
What is it?
You can tell me anything.

17:30.250 --> 17:33.330
Do you know if Ron was
in contact with the Governor?

17:33.330 --> 17:35.210
I know he had a friend
who worked there,

17:35.210 --> 17:39.290
but do you know
who that is?

17:39.290 --> 17:42.670
No, I don't remember him
talking much about the Governor.

17:42.670 --> 17:44.290
No, wait.

17:44.290 --> 17:46.830
When they found out
she had taken money

17:46.830 --> 17:48.380
from that
opioid company...

17:49.790 --> 17:51.500
...I didn't like her
after that,

17:51.500 --> 17:54.170
and neither did Ron.

17:54.170 --> 17:56.500
Why?

17:56.500 --> 17:58.710
I'm just trying
to make sense of all this.

18:01.290 --> 18:03.580
Of course you are.

18:03.580 --> 18:04.790
You miss him.

18:08.420 --> 18:09.670
Oh...

18:14.210 --> 18:17.830
The day of the wedding,
after you and Ron had the fight,

18:17.830 --> 18:19.120
he came here.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.170
Uh, he --
he didn't tell me much.

18:21.170 --> 18:22.580
He just said
he messed up,

18:22.580 --> 18:26.500
and he needed my engagement ring
to make it right.

18:26.500 --> 18:29.580
And I knew he cared
very much about you,

18:29.580 --> 18:30.880
so I gave it to him.

18:32.620 --> 18:34.380
And he left...

18:37.330 --> 18:38.710
Did he propose?

18:42.620 --> 18:44.210
No.
Oh, God.

18:44.210 --> 18:46.210
I shouldn't
have said anything.

18:46.210 --> 18:48.670
It's okay.

18:52.330 --> 18:53.330
Hey. Bonnie...

18:57.670 --> 19:01.330
I know that God would not
take away my son,

19:01.330 --> 19:04.880
not so soon after
my husband's passing.

19:04.880 --> 19:06.500
I know that,

19:06.500 --> 19:09.250
and I know
they will find him.

19:09.250 --> 19:12.710
So you hold on
to that hope,

19:12.710 --> 19:16.710
because we're all going
to be together here soon.

19:16.710 --> 19:17.920
I know it.

19:31.960 --> 19:34.380
I'm not doing this
without my lawyer.

19:34.380 --> 19:37.040
So you don't want us
to drop the charges?

19:37.040 --> 19:38.960
No, I want
a full immunity deal

19:38.960 --> 19:41.460
so the FBI can never throw these
baseless charges at me again.

19:41.460 --> 19:42.920
Valid charges.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.620
You're just lucky we only
hit you with one count.

19:44.620 --> 19:46.330
Really?
I'm just curious.

19:46.330 --> 19:47.960
What is it
that I did?

19:47.960 --> 19:49.290
D.A. Miller,

19:49.290 --> 19:51.040
a man you were working
as a mole for,

19:51.040 --> 19:52.790
is missing...
Stop.

19:52.790 --> 19:54.420
...and your only alibi
is your lawyer.

19:54.420 --> 19:56.250
You know, honestly,
I thought

19:56.250 --> 19:57.670
you all would be
a little smarter than this.

19:57.670 --> 20:00.540
The same lawyer who used to be
married to your father,

20:00.540 --> 20:01.960
Sam Keating.

20:03.330 --> 20:05.580
There it is.

20:05.580 --> 20:07.670
I've been waiting for you
to bring that up.

20:07.670 --> 20:10.880
So this -- all of this is --
it's about Annalise, right?

20:10.880 --> 20:12.460
That's the truth?

20:12.460 --> 20:14.380
Do you think there's something
we should know about her?

20:14.380 --> 20:15.580
I didn't say that.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.460
We can
give you immunity.

20:20.460 --> 20:22.500
You just have to work for us
instead of her.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.000
I don't work for her.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.460
Are you sure
about that?

20:28.420 --> 20:31.420
We know everything,
Gabriel.

20:31.420 --> 20:33.830
Cooperate...
or end up in jail.

20:41.290 --> 20:42.620
Can I think?

20:53.000 --> 20:54.830
Woman: At the tone,

20:54.830 --> 20:57.120
please record your message.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.790
It's me.

20:58.790 --> 21:02.000
Just checking in to see
if you have any info for us.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.540
Give me a call
when you can.

21:03.540 --> 21:04.920
Sooner the better.

21:10.210 --> 21:12.790
Sorry. This is the first
free second I've had all day.

21:12.790 --> 21:15.210
Yeah. I get it.
Representing terrorists
is pretty demanding.

21:15.210 --> 21:17.120
I can't handle
the scolding right now.

21:17.120 --> 21:19.790
That's not
why I called you in.

21:19.790 --> 21:21.380
I have a great idea.

21:21.380 --> 21:24.500
We do a press conference
on the Maddox case.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.750
-No.
-No, just think about it.

21:25.750 --> 21:29.540
C&G intern being unjustly
charged with terrorism.

21:29.540 --> 21:31.670
White-shoe law firm
shining a spotlight

21:31.670 --> 21:34.500
on institutional racism.
If the spotlight
is too big,

21:34.500 --> 21:36.330
then the Feds will force us
into a trial.

21:36.330 --> 21:38.380
Since when have you been
afraid of a trial?

21:38.380 --> 21:40.250
He's a law student who doesn't
want that attention.

21:40.250 --> 21:42.170
The two of us could use that
kind of attention right now.

21:44.920 --> 21:46.290
I mean, Jensen's probably
rallying the --

21:46.290 --> 21:47.790
the Board
to fire us as we speak.

21:47.790 --> 21:49.830
-We'll sue.
-All I'm saying is,

21:49.830 --> 21:51.460
let's go
on the offense here.

21:51.460 --> 21:52.750
You love a good fight...

21:52.750 --> 21:54.500
...and you made me
love them, too.

21:54.500 --> 21:56.040
I said no.

21:58.920 --> 22:00.880
Annalise. What --
What aren't telling me?

22:00.880 --> 22:03.290
Hmm?

22:03.290 --> 22:05.250
Hey, look, okay.

22:05.250 --> 22:08.540
After what you did for me
with Nora, I owe you.

22:08.540 --> 22:09.880
So let me help.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.120
You can help by doing
exactly what I just said.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.500
No press conference.

22:23.290 --> 22:24.750
Michaela: I know
how to keep Tegan quiet.

22:24.750 --> 22:26.250
Let me talk to her.
I'm taking stress
off your plate.

22:26.250 --> 22:27.670
Be happy.

22:27.670 --> 22:30.500
Tegan was already an FBI source
for Antares, right?

22:30.500 --> 22:32.000
Which means she might
rat us out to them, too.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.170
So, Oliver?

22:35.040 --> 22:37.710
-She made me do this.
-Just show them.

22:43.670 --> 22:46.080
-Have you already sent this?
-No. But we should.

22:46.080 --> 22:48.330
-It's a horrible idea.
-If Tegan thinks the FBI

22:48.330 --> 22:50.040
couldn't protect
her Jane Doe identity,

22:50.040 --> 22:51.960
she'll be less likely
to talk to them again.

22:51.960 --> 22:53.580
Why not just deport her, too,
since you're so good at that?

22:53.580 --> 22:54.960
She's suspicious of us,

22:54.960 --> 22:56.670
but this e-mail
will scare her into silence.

22:56.670 --> 22:58.000
We should send it, right?

22:58.000 --> 22:59.670
If my father sees this e-mail,
he will kill her.

22:59.670 --> 23:00.960
He can't in prison.

23:00.960 --> 23:02.330
-I thought you liked Tegan.
-I love her.

23:02.330 --> 23:04.500
That is why I know
what will scare her.

23:04.500 --> 23:05.790
The only people you're scaring
right now is us

23:05.790 --> 23:07.460
with your sociopathic
little brain.

23:07.460 --> 23:08.880
-Okay, my sociopathic big brain.
-Oliver.

23:10.120 --> 23:11.670
You promise that
they won't be able

23:11.670 --> 23:13.120
to trace this back to us,
right?
Are you serious?

23:13.120 --> 23:14.250
-No, Annalise.
-No, Annalise.

23:14.250 --> 23:15.460
I only want
to hear from Oliver.

23:17.670 --> 23:19.790
They'll ping it
to a Mongolian sheep farmer

23:19.790 --> 23:21.040
before they look here.

23:57.210 --> 23:58.580
Nate find anything?

23:58.580 --> 23:59.880
No.

23:59.880 --> 24:01.710
Dude's a task master --
I'll give him that.

24:04.290 --> 24:05.620
Pour me one.

24:13.250 --> 24:16.040
What the hell?

24:16.040 --> 24:17.250
You're talking
to his ma?

24:19.750 --> 24:21.880
I saw her.

24:25.960 --> 24:28.120
You want
to get better or no?

24:28.120 --> 24:30.750
You hadn't found anything
tying him to the Governor --

24:30.750 --> 24:32.710
So his mom's
gonna help with that?

24:32.710 --> 24:33.830
It was worth a try.

24:33.830 --> 24:35.080
Hey.

24:38.750 --> 24:40.960
Do what you want.

24:40.960 --> 24:42.920
Just tell me
about these things.

24:42.920 --> 24:45.790
At least
so I can help.

24:45.790 --> 24:47.080
Okay?

25:05.080 --> 25:07.330
-Find Miller yet?
-Nope.

25:07.330 --> 25:09.080
Anything
on our terrorist?

25:09.080 --> 25:10.710
Nada, but damn
if this young man's e-mail game

25:10.710 --> 25:12.170
was not strong.

25:12.170 --> 25:14.750
I mean...these women he was
at college with just ate it up.

25:14.750 --> 25:16.580
-Show me.
-Unh-unh. Do not show her.

25:16.580 --> 25:18.040
-Why?
-You still like him.

25:18.040 --> 25:19.750
I just wanna know
if they're not as hot as I am.

25:19.750 --> 25:21.380
No one's as hot as you.

25:21.380 --> 25:23.920
Oh, except for you standing
next to Gabriel.

25:23.920 --> 25:26.670
Mm, ah, we do look
good together.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.170
He told his mom
about you.

25:30.170 --> 25:31.290
-What?
-He did?

25:31.290 --> 25:33.080
Yeah. Those texts
weren't about Annalise.

25:33.080 --> 25:35.210
They were about you.
-I told you not to tell her.

25:35.210 --> 25:36.880
-Why not?
-So you don't think

25:36.880 --> 25:38.250
of giving him
a second chance.

25:38.250 --> 25:40.000
Hand me
this computer.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.380
Okay, you guys have to stop
making me out to be

25:42.380 --> 25:43.750
some pathetic,
boy-crazy --

25:43.750 --> 25:46.710
Oliver: Disaster who has
terrible instincts about men?

25:46.710 --> 25:49.170
Rude.
Seriously, I am
one of those men.

25:49.170 --> 25:51.380
Why are you looking
at Gabriel's manny cam?

25:51.380 --> 25:53.540
We never watched the footage
of the feds arresting him.

25:53.540 --> 25:55.790
So if they went outside
the scope of the warrant,

25:55.790 --> 25:57.250
we can get
the charges dropped.

25:57.250 --> 25:59.330
That would also require us
telling the FBI

25:59.330 --> 26:00.920
that Frank put a camera
in Gabriel's --

26:00.920 --> 26:02.460
-We're desperate.

26:02.460 --> 26:03.920
Get on board.

26:12.460 --> 26:14.290
Your Honor,
I'm requesting a motion

26:14.290 --> 26:17.080
to dismiss the charges.
On what grounds?

26:17.080 --> 26:19.620
My client has been openly
critical of the police force

26:19.620 --> 26:21.330
and their treatment
of people of color.

26:21.330 --> 26:23.920
And as a result,
the FBI has labeled him

26:23.920 --> 26:26.620
as a "Black Identity
Extremist."

26:26.620 --> 26:28.880
As if it's so "extreme" to think
that black lives matter.

26:28.880 --> 26:31.330
Oh, no playing the race card,
Ms. Keating.

26:31.330 --> 26:33.580
Well, it's not a card
if it's a fact, Judge,

26:33.580 --> 26:36.670
and the FBI has used that label
to transform my client

26:36.670 --> 26:38.750
from an activist
to a terrorist.

26:38.750 --> 26:40.330
And if they can't find
the evidence to prove it,

26:40.330 --> 26:41.380
then they'll
fabricate it.

26:41.380 --> 26:42.500
Objection.

26:42.500 --> 26:45.420
-There's no proof of that.
-You want proof?

26:45.420 --> 26:48.380
My client was so concerned
with being illegally monitored

26:48.380 --> 26:50.380
by law enforcement
that he decided

26:50.380 --> 26:51.580
to monitor himself
in his own apartment.

26:51.580 --> 26:53.250
And thank God he did.
What the hell is this?

26:53.250 --> 26:54.620
-You'll thank us later.
-As you can see,

26:54.620 --> 26:56.670
the agent
plants the evidence

26:56.670 --> 26:58.830
that the FBI can't find
in the first place.

27:04.250 --> 27:07.290
Now, this mask
is the only evidence

27:07.290 --> 27:10.170
that's connecting Mr. Maddox
to the man in the photo.

27:10.170 --> 27:12.920
So, as such,
I am asking permission

27:12.920 --> 27:17.120
to play that race card
and get this case dismissed.

27:17.120 --> 27:20.080
Judge Horning: Mr. Bordal, would
you like to drop these charges,

27:20.080 --> 27:21.830
or are you going
to humiliate your office

27:21.830 --> 27:24.210
by having me
dismiss them?

27:24.210 --> 27:25.290
My apologies, Your Honor.

27:25.290 --> 27:26.290
And, yes,

27:26.290 --> 27:27.960
the government
officially withdraws

27:27.960 --> 27:30.880
all charges
against Mr. Maddox.

27:30.880 --> 27:32.080
Case dismissed.

27:39.580 --> 27:41.830
-You've been recording me?
-Not us -- Frank.

27:41.830 --> 27:43.620
-That's sick.
-You mean smart.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.250
You were Miller's mole
this whole time.

27:45.250 --> 27:47.380
Let me get this straight.
You've been watching me

27:47.380 --> 27:49.170
sleep, get dressed,
shower?

27:49.170 --> 27:50.460
I always turned away
for those parts.

27:50.460 --> 27:51.790
Are you mad at us
for watching you,

27:51.790 --> 27:53.250
or at yourself

27:53.250 --> 27:54.380
for not knowing that
there was a camera there?

27:54.380 --> 27:55.750
Does it matter?

27:55.750 --> 27:57.330
Look, I can report all of you
to the police right now.

27:57.330 --> 27:58.920
And I'm guessing
this whole camera situation

27:58.920 --> 28:00.210
isn't the worst thing
you've all done.

28:00.210 --> 28:02.040
Quiet. That footage
is the only thing

28:02.040 --> 28:04.750
that kept your ass from jail.
So say thank you.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.500
-I'm leaving.
-You are not.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.420
Take him to your place.
Don't let him leave your sight.

28:08.420 --> 28:09.790
Behave.

28:12.670 --> 28:14.120
Any word from Tegan?

28:14.120 --> 28:15.620
No news is good news.

28:15.620 --> 28:17.420
Since when is that true?

28:19.670 --> 28:20.880
You rang?

28:20.880 --> 28:23.380
This is weird, right?

28:23.380 --> 28:25.580
What is?
Uh, her -- her student
being charged

28:25.580 --> 28:27.000
for terrorism
in the first place,

28:27.000 --> 28:28.670
but then not
telling me about it.

28:30.170 --> 28:31.670
You're taking
this personally?

28:34.920 --> 28:37.750
I'm just saying, the last time
you called me in here to talk

28:37.750 --> 28:39.540
was to ask me
about Annalise.

28:39.540 --> 28:41.120
That's not true.
And Eve Rothlo.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.420
Okay,
maybe that's true.

28:44.880 --> 28:46.540
What do you do
for fun?

28:46.540 --> 28:49.380
Do you play golf,
poker?

28:49.380 --> 28:51.250
Have any friends
at all?

28:51.250 --> 28:52.920
Because this
"thirsty for Annalise"

28:52.920 --> 28:54.120
is not a good look.

28:54.120 --> 28:55.620
For either of us,
you mean.

28:57.120 --> 28:58.920
Joke.

28:58.920 --> 29:01.290
No, I don't
have any friends.

29:01.290 --> 29:04.040
Why don't, uh, us two,
uh, go get a drink?

29:05.710 --> 29:07.170
I've got so much work.

29:09.290 --> 29:10.420
Rain check.

29:12.750 --> 29:14.210
Sir,
I.T.'s on the phone.

29:14.210 --> 29:16.000
She says it's urgent.

29:20.330 --> 29:21.960
This is Crawford.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.120
Talk before
I shoot myself.

29:52.750 --> 29:56.080
Miller called
this number.

29:56.080 --> 29:58.500
It's registered
to Maria Sloane in Cleveland.

29:58.500 --> 29:59.710
Who's this?

30:01.880 --> 30:03.750
Who?

30:03.750 --> 30:05.790
The adoption,
Annalise.

30:08.960 --> 30:09.830
Maria:
Hi, Miss Keating.

30:09.830 --> 30:11.460
This is Maria Sloane

30:11.460 --> 30:12.540
from the Department of
Children and Family Services

30:12.540 --> 30:14.170
in Cleveland.

30:14.170 --> 30:16.380
Miller dug up
the adoption papers

30:16.380 --> 30:19.040
and gave them
to Birkhead.

30:19.040 --> 30:20.830
Well, we can't give this
to the FBI.

30:20.830 --> 30:22.420
It's the only thing we have
linking Miller to the Governor.

30:22.420 --> 30:24.420
The adoption links me
to Sam's killer.

30:24.420 --> 30:26.210
How's that gonna help us?
-No one says it does.

30:26.210 --> 30:28.500
It's just --
just all we got.

30:36.500 --> 30:39.210
Why don't you
get a knife?

30:39.210 --> 30:40.960
Cut me open,
bleed me dry.

30:42.960 --> 30:44.960
That's what
you all want, right?

30:44.960 --> 30:46.830
'Cause I'm not the one
killing people around here.

30:46.830 --> 30:48.170
I just clean up the mess.

30:48.170 --> 30:51.540
Like that's why I worked
my ass off my entire life --

30:51.540 --> 30:53.580
just to be your damn maid.

30:53.580 --> 30:56.420
So, go on.

30:56.420 --> 30:58.210
Take what's left of me!

31:13.880 --> 31:16.290
So what's more fun?

31:16.290 --> 31:18.290
Watching me here
or watching me on camera?

31:18.290 --> 31:22.040
You were quieter
at home.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.830
Did you know they were
watching us when you kissed me?

31:23.830 --> 31:25.120
You kissed me.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.420
So that's a yes?

31:26.420 --> 31:28.040
We didn't know
there was a camera then.

31:28.040 --> 31:29.830
I did.
We were spying on you

31:29.830 --> 31:31.080
like you were
spying on us.

31:31.080 --> 31:33.290
And what'd you
find out, Laurel? Hmm?

31:33.290 --> 31:34.620
Nothing, right?

31:34.620 --> 31:36.420
Because Miller was too smart
to go to your apartment.

31:36.420 --> 31:38.120
I talked to the guy
like three times.

31:38.120 --> 31:39.460
And, honestly,
all of you would've done

31:39.460 --> 31:41.120
the same exact thing
if you were in my shoes.

31:41.120 --> 31:42.290
We'd never be
in your shoes

31:42.290 --> 31:44.210
because we're not
morons.

31:44.210 --> 31:46.380
You want to make me
the enemy?

31:46.380 --> 31:49.170
The only reason I did any
of this was about my father.

31:51.620 --> 31:52.790
Wanting to know him.

31:55.830 --> 31:57.250
There's nothing wrong
with that.

32:04.540 --> 32:05.620
It's Annalise.

32:08.250 --> 32:11.000
You've been honest with me,
so now it's my turn.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.170
'Cause you've
been lying?

32:12.170 --> 32:13.330
Listen.

32:17.420 --> 32:19.330
Governor Birkhead has
had a target on my back

32:19.330 --> 32:21.250
ever since
the Supreme Court case.

32:21.250 --> 32:22.460
I'm aware.
But did you know that

32:22.460 --> 32:24.000
she had
Nate Senior killed?

32:26.460 --> 32:28.080
Yeah, see what interesting
things you find out

32:28.080 --> 32:29.460
when you
shut your mouth?

32:30.830 --> 32:32.170
And she had
help doing it.

32:34.500 --> 32:35.580
Who?

32:35.580 --> 32:38.080
Miller.

32:38.080 --> 32:40.460
Still no sign of Miller.

32:40.460 --> 32:42.000
Or Nate.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.500
Or Nate killing Miller.

32:44.500 --> 32:46.250
Ooh, look at
that cute one.

32:46.250 --> 32:48.330
Okay, we could just, uh,
delete that bad boy.

32:48.330 --> 32:49.830
Connor: Like you two won't be
seared into my memory

32:49.830 --> 32:51.750
until the day I die.

32:54.250 --> 32:55.750
Can you delete
that one, too?

32:58.580 --> 33:00.380
Oliver:
Okay, we're done.

33:00.380 --> 33:02.790
Miller's not in
any of the photos.

33:02.790 --> 33:04.380
We are home free.

33:04.380 --> 33:06.290
Until Gabriel sells us out.

33:08.080 --> 33:09.670
Gabriel: Why not just
tell the FBI?

33:09.670 --> 33:11.960
I can't.

33:11.960 --> 33:13.420
Why?

33:13.420 --> 33:15.120
'Cause the Governor
has something on me.

33:18.380 --> 33:20.880
I tried to adopt Wes
when he was 11.

33:25.290 --> 33:26.960
Don't answer.

33:26.960 --> 33:29.420
Nothing you say is gonna make
her, or you, feel better.

33:32.830 --> 33:34.670
Hi, Mrs. Miller.

33:34.670 --> 33:36.580
Wes had no one.

33:36.580 --> 33:39.380
His mother was dead, his father
wasn't in the picture.

33:39.380 --> 33:41.710
I wanted to give him
a family...

33:41.710 --> 33:44.830
Sam was against it.
He said he'd end our marriage.

33:44.830 --> 33:47.710
Wes found out.

33:48.960 --> 33:50.710
Maybe that's why
he killed Sam.

33:54.420 --> 33:57.580
You said Wes was
just your student.
He was.

33:57.580 --> 33:59.040
But you lied about everything
that came before that.

33:59.040 --> 34:00.540
I got
your charges dropped.

34:00.540 --> 34:02.790
You owe me.

34:02.790 --> 34:04.210
Or would you rather
the Governor get away

34:04.210 --> 34:05.500
with killing
an innocent man?

34:08.330 --> 34:10.040
Help us
take her down.

34:13.460 --> 34:15.790
You're okay
meeting alone?

34:15.790 --> 34:16.880
Yeah.

34:16.880 --> 34:19.460
Really?

34:19.460 --> 34:21.670
I'm more than happy
to call your lawyer.

34:21.670 --> 34:23.080
It's about her.

34:25.040 --> 34:26.170
I want protection.

34:28.380 --> 34:30.000
This is the FBI --
we can do that.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.080
I mean it.

34:32.830 --> 34:34.710
I'm all my mom has.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.620
Deal.

34:43.250 --> 34:45.380
D.A. Miller
told me something

34:45.380 --> 34:46.580
that might help
your investigation.

34:46.580 --> 34:48.380
But you're just
telling me this now?

34:48.380 --> 34:50.290
I was scared. And, apparently,
I had a right to be.

34:50.290 --> 34:53.040
The guy
is now missing.

34:53.040 --> 34:56.040
What did Miller
tell you?

34:56.040 --> 34:59.830
That Annalise
tried to adopt Wes Gibbins

34:59.830 --> 35:01.000
when he was a kid.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.670
Miller thought this was proof
that she was somehow involved

35:05.670 --> 35:09.420
in my dad's murder.

35:09.420 --> 35:12.460
So this person you're scared of,
who you think

35:12.460 --> 35:15.210
might have something to do
with Miller's disappearance?

35:15.210 --> 35:17.170
It's Annalise Keating?

35:20.540 --> 35:23.120
No.

35:23.120 --> 35:25.210
I heard Miller
on the phone once.

35:25.210 --> 35:27.830
It was about
the adoption.

35:27.830 --> 35:30.330
He was talking
to someone about it.

35:31.380 --> 35:33.620
Who?

35:33.620 --> 35:35.170
Someone named Lynne.

35:52.920 --> 35:55.500
Think he's playing us?

35:55.500 --> 35:59.080
I think
they're all playing us.

35:59.080 --> 36:00.920
But not for long.

36:16.880 --> 36:18.080
You wanted to see me?

36:18.080 --> 36:19.670
Always, yeah.

36:21.540 --> 36:24.330
You, uh --
You trust Tegan?

36:24.330 --> 36:25.710
Why are you
asking me that?

36:25.710 --> 36:29.790
She recently got an e-mail
that caught I.T.'s attention.

36:29.790 --> 36:31.500
What was in
the e-mail?

36:31.500 --> 36:32.380
Not important.

36:32.380 --> 36:33.750
But I know the two of you
are close, so --

36:33.750 --> 36:35.880
Says who?
Close for you, I mean.

36:37.420 --> 36:39.290
Uh, just, you know --
just tell me

36:39.290 --> 36:42.080
if you ever catch wind
of anything...

36:42.080 --> 36:43.540
out of the ordinary.

36:45.750 --> 36:47.080
Of course.

36:51.380 --> 36:53.210
You know why
you should trust her?

36:55.380 --> 36:57.500
Because she knew about your
misconduct long before I did.

36:57.500 --> 36:59.620
And she never used it
against you.

36:59.620 --> 37:01.920
That was all me.

37:15.710 --> 37:17.170
It's Crawford.

37:17.170 --> 37:20.670
I need access
to another employee's e-mails.

37:20.670 --> 37:22.170
Annalise Keating.

37:30.710 --> 37:32.170
Hey.

37:34.040 --> 37:36.080
Did you do it?

37:36.080 --> 37:37.620
Of course.

37:37.620 --> 37:39.170
You can go home,

37:39.170 --> 37:40.210
tell all
your pervy friends.

37:41.540 --> 37:44.500
After you let me in.

37:44.500 --> 37:45.830
Why?

37:45.830 --> 37:48.080
What -- now you want me?

37:48.080 --> 37:50.170
I wanna show you
where the stupid camera is.

38:15.250 --> 38:17.580
You're welcome.

38:20.880 --> 38:22.710
And just for the record,

38:22.710 --> 38:24.580

FBI agents descended

40:32.290 --> 40:34.290
on the town
of Brickerville tonight

40:34.290 --> 40:36.830
after an anonymous tip
led to the discovery

40:36.830 --> 40:38.500
of an abandoned car.

40:38.500 --> 40:40.170
Inside the trunk,

40:40.170 --> 40:42.620
police found a man's body
they've confirmed belongs

40:42.620 --> 40:45.920
to Philadelphia District
Attorney Ronald Miller.

40:45.920 --> 40:48.460
Law enforcement hasn't
revealed any information

...and supporters of law
enforcement across the nation.

40:57.250 --> 40:59.170
Ronald Miller had been with

40:59.170 --> 41:03.880
the Philadelphia District
Attorney's office for 11 years.

He made his mark early...

Just now.
...in a number

We're just receiving
a breaking news update here

41:27.880 --> 41:29.620
regarding
D.A. Miller's death.

41:29.620 --> 41:31.500
Reports out of Harrisburg
are saying

41:31.500 --> 41:34.620
that the FBI agents in charge
of D.A. Miller's case

41:34.620 --> 41:36.290
were just seen arriving

41:36.290 --> 41:38.670
at the Governor's mansion
in Harrisburg.

41:38.670 --> 41:41.170
At this time, the nature of
Governor Birkhead's involvement

41:41.170 --> 41:42.460
in this case is unclear.

41:42.460 --> 41:44.000
-Gabriel for the win.
-Annalise for the win.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.040
All of us for the win 'cause
we're not going to jail tonight.

41:46.040 --> 41:47.500
Or tomorrow,
either, hopefully.

41:47.500 --> 41:49.580
So let's break out the booze
and have a toast

41:49.580 --> 41:51.170
for the old wicked witch
Governor getting her due.

41:51.170 --> 41:52.330
-Don't jinx it.
-There's no such thing.

41:52.330 --> 41:54.120
For more now on this breaking
story out of Harrisburg...

41:54.120 --> 41:56.040

your text alert?

No, it's my Instagram.

You need to change that.

41:58.580 --> 41:59.540
our State Government Affairs
correspondent,

41:59.540 --> 42:00.710
Elijah Harrison Stamps...

42:00.710 --> 42:02.170
Connor needs to call
his mom right now.

42:02.170 --> 42:03.790
...who is live
outside the Governor's mansion.

42:03.790 --> 42:05.290
She just posted
a photo of us.

42:05.290 --> 42:06.500
No, she didn't.

42:06.500 --> 42:07.790
She did.
