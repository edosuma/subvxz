WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:03.733
(Man) We have two
auto accident victims.

00:03.734 --> 00:05.175
First, 21-year-old female
driver, unconscious,

00:05.176 --> 00:06.436
lost pulse at the scene.
Possible facial fractures.

00:06.437 --> 00:09.609
Went v-tach. B.P. 82
over 54. Heart rate 130s.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.181
Respiratory rate 30s.

00:11.182 --> 00:13.012
(Man) Second passenger,
ejected from the car.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.684
Unconscious, head
trauma, flail chest.

00:14.685 --> 00:17.487
B.p. 50 over palp.
Heart rate 150s.

00:17.488 --> 00:19.149
I don't have a pulse.

00:19.150 --> 00:21.191
Get the paddles ready.
She's crashing. She crashed!

00:21.192 --> 00:23.353
Start c.P.R. We're losing
her! We're losing her!

00:23.354 --> 00:27.098
(Monitor emitting
continuous tone)

00:28.559 --> 00:30.029
Donna whirley.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.132
She presented with
multiple traumatic injuries.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.303
She arrested on
the way to trauma.

00:33.304 --> 00:34.464
We couldn't bring her back.

00:34.465 --> 00:38.068
Her companion is
still in intensive care.

00:38.069 --> 00:41.040
Uh, ordinarily, it's just the
transpo people we meet.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.073
I'm not your ordinary m.E.

00:43.074 --> 00:44.214
Oh?

00:44.215 --> 00:46.546
The sooner I get to them,

00:46.547 --> 00:48.648
the sooner they can move on.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.320
I'd say, this
one's already left.

00:50.321 --> 00:52.322
(People speaking indistinctly)

00:52.323 --> 00:55.685
I will send transpo
in when I'm done.

00:55.686 --> 00:58.688
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

00:58.689 --> 01:02.433
(Woman speaks
indistinctly over P.A.)

01:03.834 --> 01:05.195
(Elevator bell dings)

01:05.196 --> 01:06.196
(Sighs)

01:06.197 --> 01:07.597
Excuse me.

01:07.598 --> 01:10.300
Uh, are you from
the m.E.'S office?

01:10.301 --> 01:11.341
That's right.

01:11.342 --> 01:13.343
My, uh, my daughter
Donna is, uh...

01:13.344 --> 01:16.106
Oh, yes. I know. I'm
very sorry for your loss.

01:16.107 --> 01:17.777
Thank you. I...

01:17.778 --> 01:20.150
Look, I, uh, I have to know,

01:20.151 --> 01:21.481
was Carrie drunk?

01:21.482 --> 01:23.113
Who's Carrie?

01:23.114 --> 01:24.314
She was the one who was driving.

01:24.315 --> 01:26.216
What are you saying
about my daughter?

01:26.217 --> 01:27.457
I'm asking if she was drunk.

01:27.458 --> 01:28.818
Was your daughter drunk?

01:28.819 --> 01:30.660
My daughter is dead.
Mine's in a coma.

01:30.661 --> 01:32.492
Because she was drunk!

01:32.493 --> 01:34.164
You know, she's always
been a bad influence.

01:34.165 --> 01:35.265
Shut up!

01:35.266 --> 01:37.497
(People speaking indistinctly)

01:37.498 --> 01:38.668
(Woman) Stop that.

01:38.669 --> 01:41.201
(Men grunting and
speaking indistinctly)

01:41.202 --> 01:43.703
Aah! (Sputters)

01:43.704 --> 01:46.506
You lost your child, and
you may still lose yours.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.838
You want answers?
Try not to kill each other

01:48.839 --> 01:51.641
before I have a chance
to find them, okay?

01:51.642 --> 01:53.343
(Thuds)

01:53.344 --> 01:55.185
(Man) You grab the
back door, all right?

01:55.186 --> 01:58.818
Dani, you're up. The victim's
name is Donna whirley.

01:58.819 --> 02:01.191
Steer clear of the parents.

02:01.192 --> 02:04.224
(People speaking indistinctly)

02:04.225 --> 02:05.855
I'm driving you back
to the office, aren't I?

02:05.856 --> 02:07.657
Oh, sorry.

02:07.658 --> 02:10.400
I had a lovely
evening. Do you mind?

02:10.401 --> 02:12.302
No, I don't mind. You've
got a very important job to do.

02:12.303 --> 02:14.704
Next time someone calls
me with a broken sprinkler,

02:14.705 --> 02:16.436
I hope you'll understand.

02:16.437 --> 02:19.439
As long as you still come home.

02:19.440 --> 02:24.215
(Laughs)

02:26.477 --> 02:28.478
From the geography
and the skid marks,

02:28.479 --> 02:30.620
everything points to the mustang

02:30.621 --> 02:32.322
as the cause.

02:32.323 --> 02:35.255
The driver's wallet
was on the floorboard.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.257
And this was thrown from the car

02:37.258 --> 02:38.758
along with the passenger.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.330
(Camera shutter clicking)

02:40.331 --> 02:42.332
(Tools whirring)

02:42.333 --> 02:45.235
Donna whirley.
She didn't make it.

02:45.236 --> 02:47.337
What was the condition
of her seat belt?

02:47.338 --> 02:48.838
Nothing wrong with it.

02:48.839 --> 02:51.401
But the main thing I
wanted you to see was this.

02:51.402 --> 02:53.943
(People speaking indistinctly)

02:53.944 --> 02:54.944
Where'd you find that?

02:54.945 --> 02:56.347
Driver's side door pocket.

03:00.811 --> 03:03.753
(Megan) Donna whirley,
age 21, ejected from the car.

03:03.754 --> 03:06.256
Multiple facial lacerations,

03:06.257 --> 03:08.258
bilateral pelvic fractures,

03:08.259 --> 03:09.559
flail chest.

03:09.560 --> 03:12.262
Let this be a lesson, gentlemen.

03:12.263 --> 03:14.224
Wear your seat belts.

03:14.225 --> 03:16.426
She has an old scar on her foot.

03:16.427 --> 03:18.268
Uh, it might be from a surgery.

03:18.269 --> 03:21.301
She's got a chalky white
substance on her pants leg.

03:21.302 --> 03:23.273
I already swabbed it
and got it to the lab.

03:23.274 --> 03:24.874
Muchas gracias.

03:24.875 --> 03:27.277
You know, what I don't get is...

03:27.278 --> 03:28.508
(Camera shutter clicks)

03:28.509 --> 03:29.679
This girl's blood
alcohol was negative.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.281
It was her friend who was drunk.

03:31.282 --> 03:32.412
So?

03:32.413 --> 03:34.284
So you're riding shotgun
with your drunk friend,

03:34.285 --> 03:35.985
who's speeding and
weaving through traffic,

03:35.986 --> 03:37.547
and you don't
wear your seat belt?

03:37.548 --> 03:39.289
The garage said there
was nothing wrong with it.

03:39.290 --> 03:40.550
He has a good point.

03:40.551 --> 03:42.552
If you're Donna, why
do you even let Carrie

03:42.553 --> 03:44.794
get behind the wheel in the first
place? That's another good point.

03:44.795 --> 03:47.627
Let us posit that there's a
logical explanation for both.

03:47.628 --> 03:50.300
We will not know why
Carrie was behind the wheel

03:50.301 --> 03:52.302
until she regains consciousness.

03:52.303 --> 03:56.406
But as for the seat belt...

03:56.407 --> 03:57.767
What are you looking for?

03:57.768 --> 04:01.241
Anything that would
inhibit range of motion.

04:03.374 --> 04:04.544
Ethan?

04:04.545 --> 04:05.775
Yeah.

04:05.776 --> 04:08.879
Hand me a probe.

04:12.323 --> 04:15.285
Our preliminary information
is that your daughter died from

04:15.286 --> 04:17.787
multiple traumatic injuries.

04:17.788 --> 04:19.289
I'm very sorry.

04:19.290 --> 04:21.491
Right.

04:21.492 --> 04:23.393
And w... and why
are the police here?

04:23.394 --> 04:25.034
We're here to ask, uh,

04:25.035 --> 04:26.996
do you know the
whereabouts of your daughter

04:26.997 --> 04:28.798
before she got into that car?

04:28.799 --> 04:30.400
Why? W-What does that matter?

04:30.401 --> 04:32.902
(Curtis) The driver of
the car, Mrs. Whirley,

04:32.903 --> 04:34.444
was under the drinking age,

04:34.445 --> 04:36.846
but over the legal limit
for blood alcohol level.

04:36.847 --> 04:39.749
(Scoffs) I knew it! Oh, god.

04:39.750 --> 04:42.952
Carrie was always dragging
Donna somewhere against her will,

04:42.953 --> 04:45.385
and now... Donna's the
one that ends up dead.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.687
Why haven't you arrested Carrie?

04:47.688 --> 04:48.988
She killed our daughter.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.490
If our information is correct,

04:50.491 --> 04:52.462
she will be arrested.

04:52.463 --> 04:54.664
Shh.

04:54.665 --> 04:56.065
(Crying)

04:56.066 --> 04:57.867
Hey, come on.

04:57.868 --> 04:59.529
Come on.

04:59.530 --> 05:00.770
(Crying continues)

05:00.771 --> 05:01.932
Shh.

05:04.675 --> 05:07.937
You'll never guess what showed
up on Carrie Greyson's X-ray.

05:07.938 --> 05:09.839
A bullet? How'd you know that?

05:09.840 --> 05:12.443
Carrie's in the
hospital. (Exhales)

05:13.914 --> 05:15.685
A through and through.

05:15.686 --> 05:17.348
This wasn't a traffic fatality.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.920
This was murder.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.422
(Fabric snaps)

05:22.423 --> 05:24.855
♪♪♪

05:29.329 --> 05:30.500
The bullet lodged
in the posterior apex

05:30.501 --> 05:32.432
of the left ventricle
of the heart.

05:32.433 --> 05:33.703
The heart is inflamed,

05:33.704 --> 05:35.405
but no signs of
cardiac tamponade.

05:35.406 --> 05:37.507
We'll continue to monitor
Carrie throughout the acute phase

05:37.508 --> 05:38.668
for any hemorrhage or rupture.

05:38.669 --> 05:39.940
So when can we have the bullet?

05:41.412 --> 05:43.414
I'll take it from here, doctor.

05:45.376 --> 05:47.617
Why didn't he
answer my question?

05:47.618 --> 05:49.849
He just did, but it went
over your shiny little head.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.851
The heart is like
any other tissue.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.483
You hurt it, it heals.

05:53.484 --> 05:54.984
The healing process
takes a couple of days...

05:54.985 --> 05:56.486
The acute phase, that is.

05:56.487 --> 05:59.128
Remove the bullet too soon,
the heart wall will rupture.

05:59.129 --> 06:00.490
So the answer to my question is,

06:00.491 --> 06:01.462
we can have it in
a couple of days.

06:01.463 --> 06:03.433
Hey, wait a minute.

06:03.434 --> 06:06.496
Now I-I don't wanna spoil
your plans for my daughter,

06:06.497 --> 06:08.768
but you can forget
about getting that bullet.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.440
The doctors say, she
could recover just fine

06:10.441 --> 06:11.741
without removing it.

06:11.742 --> 06:12.902
(Sam) Donna whirley is dead.

06:12.903 --> 06:14.504
Your daughter's been shot.

06:14.505 --> 06:17.577
That bullet is our best clue
at finding out who did this.

06:17.578 --> 06:20.049
When she wakes up,
she'll be happy to tell you.

06:20.050 --> 06:21.812
And if she remains in the coma?

06:23.113 --> 06:25.955
(Cell phone chirps)

06:25.956 --> 06:27.587
Garage has something for us.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.520
We'll see you later.

06:32.563 --> 06:34.524
Mr. Greyson,

06:34.525 --> 06:37.898
would you at least allow
me to see your daughter?

06:45.736 --> 06:48.739
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

06:51.482 --> 06:53.643
(Exhales)

06:53.644 --> 06:57.017
(Beeping continues)

07:01.922 --> 07:03.553
Was she wearing long sleeves?

07:03.554 --> 07:05.154
I don't know.

07:05.155 --> 07:07.858
They removed her
clothes in the E.R.

07:09.730 --> 07:12.562
May I have your
permission to examine them?

07:12.563 --> 07:16.106
They might help us
find out what happened.

07:17.908 --> 07:20.570
Yeah, sure.

07:20.571 --> 07:22.572
Hey.

07:22.573 --> 07:24.674
I looked for you at lunch.

07:24.675 --> 07:26.015
Uh, I had to run
back to my place.

07:26.016 --> 07:27.747
The window sensor
went off again.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.579
The same one I've been telling
you needed a new battery?

07:29.580 --> 07:31.481
(Laughs) Well, you
could've changed it yourself.

07:31.482 --> 07:33.553
Oh, well, then I would
need the secret code

07:33.554 --> 07:35.555
to disarm your elaborate
home defense system.

07:35.556 --> 07:36.856
Dr. Hunt called.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.858
Uh, she's on her way
back from the hospital.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.930
She needs to see you and
Kate in autopsy immediately.

07:40.931 --> 07:43.563
Okay. Uh, duty calls.

07:43.564 --> 07:45.595
Uh...

07:45.596 --> 07:46.736
(Exhales)

07:46.737 --> 07:48.037
Uh, perdon.

07:48.038 --> 07:49.969
(Clears throat)

07:49.970 --> 07:53.544
Uh, me gusto tu
vestuario. Esta muy bonita.

07:56.246 --> 07:58.007
Seriously?

07:58.008 --> 07:59.949
Nada?

07:59.950 --> 08:02.852
Me gusto tu vestuario.

08:02.853 --> 08:04.554
(Morris) What do you got?

08:04.555 --> 08:05.815
(Woman) This car over here.

08:05.816 --> 08:07.717
We found paint
transfer on the Fender

08:07.718 --> 08:10.119
that matches the paint
from Carrie's mustang.

08:10.120 --> 08:11.561
(Tools whirring)

08:11.562 --> 08:13.523
Okay, so the mustang hit it.

08:13.524 --> 08:15.595
According to witnesses, it
was the only car involved

08:15.596 --> 08:17.597
in the accident that
wasn't hit directly

08:17.598 --> 08:20.169
by Carrie's car
during the accident.

08:20.170 --> 08:21.631
The contact was made prior.

08:21.632 --> 08:23.603
Prior? Mm-hmm.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.835
And then there's this.

08:25.836 --> 08:27.907
This was found
under that driver's seat.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.579
(Whirring continues)

08:29.580 --> 08:32.582
Seven live rounds, one empty.

08:32.583 --> 08:35.514
So who's the car registered to?

08:35.515 --> 08:37.516
Rob Martin.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.819
(Whirring continues)

08:42.553 --> 08:44.554
You said you wanted to see us.

08:44.555 --> 08:46.025
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out

08:46.026 --> 08:48.197
how Carrie and
Donna were positioned

08:48.198 --> 08:49.629
when they were shot.

08:49.630 --> 08:50.760
Correct me if I'm wrong,

08:50.761 --> 08:52.261
but they were sitting
next to each other.

08:52.262 --> 08:53.633
Yeah, I know that.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.665
But was it a random firing

08:55.666 --> 08:57.837
or was somebody aiming at them?

08:57.838 --> 08:59.669
Kate...

08:59.670 --> 09:03.613
You are Donna.

09:03.614 --> 09:05.615
You brought me in here
to be a target dummy?

09:05.616 --> 09:07.677
Okay. I will be Donna.

09:07.678 --> 09:09.749
And you will be Carrie and
get a bullet in your heart.

09:09.750 --> 09:12.181
Peter, you get to shoot us.

09:12.182 --> 09:13.624
Oh, my dream come true.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.326
All right, the bullet
enters Donna here,

09:17.327 --> 09:20.790
exits here, enters Carrie here.

09:20.791 --> 09:22.662
So, Peter, what do you see?

09:22.663 --> 09:24.765
Wait. Turn back that way again.

09:26.637 --> 09:28.938
They're both turning
away from the shot.

09:28.939 --> 09:31.741
Because Donna saw the gun,

09:31.742 --> 09:33.002
so it wasn't random.

09:33.003 --> 09:34.744
All right, so she screams "gun,"

09:34.745 --> 09:36.205
and they both
instinctively turn away.

09:36.206 --> 09:38.207
But there was no bullet
hole in the car door.

09:38.208 --> 09:39.849
And the bullet is
only mildly deformed,

09:39.850 --> 09:42.111
so it had to have come
through the open window.

09:42.112 --> 09:43.653
So?

09:43.654 --> 09:45.114
So does anybody know
how high off the ground

09:45.115 --> 09:46.816
the window opening
of a '95 mustang is?

09:46.817 --> 09:48.317
An excellent question.

09:48.318 --> 09:49.819
Let me know when you find out.

09:49.820 --> 09:51.621
(Chuckles)

09:51.622 --> 09:53.162
We done?

09:53.163 --> 09:54.664
We're never done.

09:54.665 --> 09:56.296
Mm.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.904
(Morris) How you
feeling, Mr. Martin?

10:04.905 --> 10:06.605
Two pins, both legs,

10:06.606 --> 10:08.007
and they won't give
me any more morphine.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.709
How would you feel?

10:09.710 --> 10:11.010
What happened to your hands?

10:11.011 --> 10:12.842
Airbag burns.

10:12.843 --> 10:14.744
I didn't even know
it was possible.

10:14.745 --> 10:16.686
So much for getting
gunshot residue.

10:16.687 --> 10:18.748
The '95 mustang,

10:18.749 --> 10:20.219
we know the driver was drunk.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.122
We know she sideswiped
you before the accident.

10:23.123 --> 10:26.796
And we also know both she
and her passenger were shot.

10:26.797 --> 10:28.698
Which brings us
to the gun we found

10:28.699 --> 10:29.829
under your driver seat.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.361
The one with one round
conspicuously fired.

10:32.362 --> 10:33.863
Hold on a second.

10:33.864 --> 10:35.364
No way.

10:35.365 --> 10:37.036
I'm a process server.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.038
I wind up in bad places
talking to bad people

10:39.039 --> 10:40.239
all the time.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.911
You ever shoot one
of these bad people?

10:41.912 --> 10:44.674
No. But you do like scaring
people with that gun, don't you?

10:44.675 --> 10:47.046
In fact, you were cited
for pulling it just last year.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.849
So this girl sideswipes you,

10:49.850 --> 10:51.721
you chase after
her, pull your gun

10:51.722 --> 10:52.852
to scare the crap out of her,

10:52.853 --> 10:54.183
somehow it goes off.

10:54.184 --> 10:56.185
She sideswiped me, and
your damn right I went after her,

10:56.186 --> 10:57.727
to get her license plate number.

10:57.728 --> 10:59.088
I didn't touch my gun.

10:59.089 --> 11:00.830
You're an angry man, Mr. Martin.

11:00.831 --> 11:02.331
Because I'm in pain.

11:02.332 --> 11:04.163
Can't you get them to
give me more morphine?

11:04.164 --> 11:05.695
Yeah.

11:05.696 --> 11:07.437
We'll get right on that.

11:11.842 --> 11:13.142
Take away the fired round,

11:13.143 --> 11:14.673
I still wouldn't
believe that jerk.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.877
Yeah, but how are we
gonna prove he's the shooter?

11:17.878 --> 11:21.251
We gotta get that bullet.

11:27.017 --> 11:28.187
Donna and Carrie were
hit by the same bullet.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.358
The irony is, the
wounds were survivable.

11:29.359 --> 11:30.820
It was the crash
that killed Donna.

11:30.821 --> 11:32.321
Bud and Sam have any leads?

11:32.322 --> 11:33.963
They think it might
be a case of road rage,

11:33.964 --> 11:36.295
but Carrie's parents won't
allow the bullet to be removed,

11:36.296 --> 11:37.426
so without it...

11:37.427 --> 11:38.968
Bud and Sam are stuck.

11:38.969 --> 11:40.830
(Peter) Maybe, maybe not.

11:40.831 --> 11:42.171
I've been going over

11:42.172 --> 11:43.432
the measurements
of Carrie's car.

11:43.433 --> 11:45.134
The shot could've come
through the window,

11:45.135 --> 11:47.206
but unless it originated
in a truck or an s.U.V.,

11:47.207 --> 11:48.477
it's borderline.

11:48.478 --> 11:51.180
But if what they weren't in
the car when they were shot?

11:51.181 --> 11:53.012
What if they got into
the car to get away from

11:53.013 --> 11:54.844
whoever it was that
was shooting at 'em?

11:54.845 --> 11:56.846
That would explain how
Carrie got behind the wheel,

11:56.847 --> 11:59.048
if they were both
running for their lives.

11:59.049 --> 12:00.449
If this isn't road rage,
then you'd have to think

12:00.450 --> 12:02.151
one of them was the target

12:02.152 --> 12:03.492
and the other
one got in the way.

12:03.493 --> 12:04.824
We need to know where they were

12:04.825 --> 12:06.425
before they got in that car.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.457
Let's get on it.

12:08.458 --> 12:10.729
They were on...

12:10.730 --> 12:12.731
(Imitates Marlon Brando in
"Superman") The planet Krypton.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.263
Ethan, I'm not in the mood.

12:14.264 --> 12:15.765
(Normal voice) The
chalky white substance

12:15.766 --> 12:17.907
on Donna's pant
leg is kryptonite.

12:17.908 --> 12:19.939
Or the closest thing to it.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.510
Look...

12:21.511 --> 12:23.472
Kryptonite doesn't
actually exist, of course,

12:23.473 --> 12:26.345
but if you'll just
move down the line,

12:26.346 --> 12:28.747
a new mineral was
recently discovered

12:28.748 --> 12:31.220
in a Serbian mine...

12:31.221 --> 12:33.823
That almost exactly matches

12:33.824 --> 12:35.254
the chemical
formula for kryptonite,

12:35.255 --> 12:37.286
stolen by Lex Luthor in that

12:37.287 --> 12:39.789
abysmal failure of a
movie, "Superman returns"...

12:39.790 --> 12:43.762
Sodium, lithium,
boron, silicate hydroxide.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.764
It's not green,
it's chalky white,

12:45.765 --> 12:48.037
and it was on Donna's pant leg.

12:48.038 --> 12:49.198
How did it get there?

12:49.199 --> 12:50.369
That's what I asked myself.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.371
Turns out, Donna
was a geology major

12:52.372 --> 12:55.044
and an intern at
the college museum.

12:55.045 --> 12:58.107
Now the museum just
recently received a sample

12:58.108 --> 13:01.050
of kryptonite from Serbia.

13:01.051 --> 13:02.982
¿Quien es El gran superhero?

13:02.983 --> 13:04.814
Hey, yo soy.

13:04.815 --> 13:05.985
♪ Yo soy ♪

13:05.986 --> 13:07.156
What the hell is wrong with you?

13:07.157 --> 13:08.487
I'm learning Spanish.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.819
Look, you're not the
only one who can woo...

13:09.820 --> 13:10.990
(Imitates al Pacino in
"scarface") The latinas, man.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.361
Dani doesn't speak
Spanish, Ethan.

13:12.362 --> 13:13.792
(Normal voice) Really?
What is she, Portuguese?

13:13.793 --> 13:15.464
Ethan!

13:15.465 --> 13:16.926
What about Carrie's
clothes in the hospital?

13:16.927 --> 13:18.297
Did you get a trace on them?

13:18.298 --> 13:19.829
You won't even let
me enjoy this moment?

13:19.830 --> 13:21.401
No. Get back to work.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.880
Just popped in to say hello.

13:30.881 --> 13:32.211
Hello.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.143
And ask where this is going,

13:34.144 --> 13:36.385
as in us, you and
me, the future.

13:36.386 --> 13:37.546
(Sighs)

13:37.547 --> 13:40.820
Is subtle not in
your vocabulary?

13:42.993 --> 13:45.455
I think we should
move in together.

13:47.597 --> 13:49.899
Donna was nice enough.

13:49.900 --> 13:52.031
When was the last time
any of you saw Donna?

13:52.032 --> 13:53.933
Last night. She was
boxing up her samples

13:53.934 --> 13:55.364
when she just took off.

13:55.365 --> 13:57.406
Said she was late
meeting Carrie.

13:57.407 --> 13:58.837
Late meeting her where?

13:58.838 --> 13:59.969
Uh, Duke's?

13:59.970 --> 14:02.111
It's a campus bar
about six blocks away.

14:02.112 --> 14:03.943
But they must have
gotten their wires crossed,

14:03.944 --> 14:06.415
because Carrie showed
up here, looking for her.

14:06.416 --> 14:08.978
Really? Then what happened?

14:08.979 --> 14:11.250
She just left. That's all.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.924
Okay, thanks.

14:17.127 --> 14:19.128
Wait.

14:19.129 --> 14:20.429
Hang on, Sam.

14:20.430 --> 14:22.631
Excuse me. Who is that?

14:22.632 --> 14:23.993
Oh.

14:23.994 --> 14:26.865
Uh, Suzie foster.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.367
The rest of you are arm in arm.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.600
No love lost between
Donna and Suzie?

14:31.601 --> 14:33.202
She and Donna were up
for the same scholarship.

14:33.203 --> 14:34.643
Donna won.

14:34.644 --> 14:36.475
You know, it's funny,
come to think of it,

14:36.476 --> 14:38.177
Carrie was staring
at that picture, too.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.179
Oh, really? When?

14:40.180 --> 14:41.611
Right before she ran outta here.

14:45.285 --> 14:46.455
Okay.

14:46.456 --> 14:48.588
(Camera phone shutter clicks)

14:53.964 --> 14:59.328
Hey. Lace.

14:59.329 --> 15:00.629
What are you doing here?

15:00.630 --> 15:02.071
Grandma's waiting downstairs,

15:02.072 --> 15:04.073
but you said you wanted
a picture for your office,

15:04.074 --> 15:06.005
so here it is.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.177
What do you think?

15:09.309 --> 15:11.510
What do I think?
I think I love it.

15:11.511 --> 15:14.483
Oh, thank you. It's beautiful.

15:14.484 --> 15:16.986
What about right there?

15:16.987 --> 15:18.989
Yeah. Perfect.

15:21.491 --> 15:23.093
Aw.

15:25.295 --> 15:27.027
Wow, lace.

15:29.299 --> 15:32.432
Ugh. Lacey. Ah.

15:34.164 --> 15:36.235
(Mutters)

15:36.236 --> 15:37.968
(Picture slides against wall)

15:39.970 --> 15:42.111
Congratulations. Hey, Lacey.

15:42.112 --> 15:43.272
For what?

15:43.273 --> 15:44.443
I put you up for

15:44.444 --> 15:45.614
the Philadelphia
medical association

15:45.615 --> 15:47.416
public service award. You won.

15:47.417 --> 15:48.577
I did what?

15:48.578 --> 15:50.019
I didn't do it for you.

15:50.020 --> 15:51.520
I did it to enhance the
prestige of this office.

15:51.521 --> 15:53.682
Ceremony's tomorrow.
Look your best.

15:53.683 --> 15:56.525
Bye, Lacey.

15:56.526 --> 15:58.427
God, I hate award ceremonies.

15:58.428 --> 16:00.990
Crappy food and
chitchat with strangers.

16:00.991 --> 16:03.592
Well, then why don't
you just take Aidan?

16:03.593 --> 16:05.434
No.i could not do that to him.

16:05.435 --> 16:06.735
You took him to see a body.

16:06.736 --> 16:08.067
I mean, this has gotta
be an improvement.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.238
(Chuckles)

16:09.239 --> 16:10.400
(Cell phone rings)

16:13.603 --> 16:16.006
Lace, sorry. I gotta go.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.508
Thank you, thank you,
thank you for my picture.

16:19.509 --> 16:23.013
I love it. Say hello to grandma.

16:25.355 --> 16:28.287
A picture is worth a
thousand words, Suzie.

16:28.288 --> 16:29.618
(Beeps)

16:29.619 --> 16:31.991
What's that one say?

16:35.065 --> 16:38.597
I wasn't a Donna whirley fan.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.129
That doesn't mean I shot her.

16:40.130 --> 16:42.131
The accident happened at 9:30.

16:42.132 --> 16:43.772
You got out of chem lab at 9:00.

16:43.773 --> 16:45.734
Did you take a ride
down the highway?

16:45.735 --> 16:47.536
And lose my parking space?

16:47.537 --> 16:49.038
No way.

16:49.039 --> 16:50.709
No, I walk to class and back.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.211
It's 20 minutes across campus.

16:52.212 --> 16:55.544
Did you talk to anyone?
Did anyone see you?

16:55.545 --> 16:57.086
I'm sure somebody saw me.

16:57.087 --> 16:59.148
I mean, I'm not
invisible. (Chuckles)

16:59.149 --> 17:02.151
Look, if I had a gun and
was psycho enough to use it,

17:02.152 --> 17:05.125
don't you think someone
would've heard the shot?

17:06.326 --> 17:08.327
Why didn't you like Donna?

17:08.328 --> 17:10.559
Donna got a
scholarship she wanted.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.161
No, that wasn't it.

17:12.162 --> 17:14.363
My problem with Donna was that

17:14.364 --> 17:16.235
she was always
playing poor little sick girl

17:16.236 --> 17:18.407
because she had lupus.

17:18.408 --> 17:19.809
(Morris) Lupus?

17:24.574 --> 17:27.077
I ran the a.N.A.
Test like you asked.

17:30.820 --> 17:31.781
Negative.

17:31.782 --> 17:33.482
Mm-hmm.

17:33.483 --> 17:35.784
This girl did not have
lupus. She's in perfect health.

17:35.785 --> 17:39.428
So maybe Suzie was lying.

17:39.429 --> 17:41.430
Why would she lie
about something like that?

17:41.431 --> 17:43.163
(Sighs)

17:47.737 --> 17:49.168
Oh, god.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.739
What?

17:50.740 --> 17:52.571
Carrie.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.072
The girl in the hospital

17:54.073 --> 17:55.674
with a bullet lodged
in the wall of her heart,

17:55.675 --> 17:57.446
her inflamed heart.

17:57.447 --> 17:59.308
That's a symptom of lupus.

17:59.309 --> 18:00.479
I don't get it.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.810
Two girls, same
height, same hair color,

18:01.811 --> 18:03.582
same body type.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.083
Oh, no.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.415
The paramedics at the scene,

18:06.416 --> 18:08.317
they... they must
have misidentified her,

18:08.318 --> 18:10.159
and we never
questioned it. (Sighs)

18:10.160 --> 18:12.792
This is not Donna.

18:14.864 --> 18:16.866
It's Carrie.

18:21.731 --> 18:22.702
How the hell could this happen?

18:22.703 --> 18:24.173
I know you're
upset, Mr. Greyson...

18:24.174 --> 18:25.804
Upset?! One minute
we're with our daughter,

18:25.805 --> 18:27.806
the next, the whirleys
show up with a priest

18:27.807 --> 18:29.678
and a hospital administrator,

18:29.679 --> 18:31.510
telling us there'd
been a mistake.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.642
A mistake?!

18:33.643 --> 18:35.684
I don't give a damn
what anyone says.

18:35.685 --> 18:37.686
That's our daughter in that bed.

18:37.687 --> 18:40.349
Mr. Greyson.

18:40.350 --> 18:42.721
Did your daughter have
surgery on her left foot?

18:42.722 --> 18:43.852
What the hell does that matter?

18:43.853 --> 18:45.324
Did they put a screw in it?

18:45.325 --> 18:47.897
Yes. In high school. Why?

18:49.799 --> 18:53.662
I took these x-rays
about a half-hour ago

18:53.663 --> 18:54.803
in our morgue,

18:54.804 --> 18:56.765
of Carrie's foot.

18:56.766 --> 18:59.409
I'm very sorry.

19:09.179 --> 19:10.680
(Tablet clatters)

19:19.759 --> 19:20.789
How...

19:20.790 --> 19:24.533
Uh, neither of them
had I.D. On their person.

19:24.534 --> 19:26.665
Donna's book bag was
found outside the car

19:26.666 --> 19:28.367
near your daughter,

19:28.368 --> 19:29.798
and your daughter's wallet
was found inside the car

19:29.799 --> 19:31.169
next to Donna.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.871
(Curtis) Because of
their physical similarities,

19:32.872 --> 19:35.544
the paramedics
mistook one for the other.

19:35.545 --> 19:37.877
It was a tragic
misunderstanding.

19:42.512 --> 19:44.513
(Voice breaks) Who
killed my daughter?

19:44.514 --> 19:48.857
There is a chance that it
might be a case of road rage.

19:48.858 --> 19:52.321
However, we do not
have access to the bullet.

19:52.322 --> 19:54.793
Then get it.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.825
That's up to the whirleys now.

19:56.826 --> 19:58.697
And we can't order
them to comply

19:58.698 --> 20:00.629
any more than we
could order you...

20:00.630 --> 20:01.831
Do you think I give a damn?!

20:05.835 --> 20:08.977
My wife collapsed
in the hospital

20:08.978 --> 20:10.309
when they told us.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.841
She's under sedation right now.

20:12.842 --> 20:14.883
Our lives are ruined.

20:14.884 --> 20:17.986
And as god as my
witness, I will sue everyone

20:17.987 --> 20:19.948
who had anything to do with this

20:19.949 --> 20:22.392
for the horror we've
been put through!

20:30.500 --> 20:32.831
Anything I can do?

20:32.832 --> 20:35.805
I wish there were.

20:45.315 --> 20:48.677
So Carrie was Donna
and Donna was Carrie.

20:48.678 --> 20:50.519
I'm really glad
I'm not in charge.

20:50.520 --> 20:51.880
Thanks for nothing. Mm-hmm.

20:51.881 --> 20:53.251
What are you doing?

20:53.252 --> 20:55.684
I am checking out
the trace results

20:55.685 --> 20:58.256
from Donna's clothes that
we got from the hospital.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.488
I thought you did that already.

20:59.489 --> 21:00.959
No, no, no, that was
when Donna was Carrie.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.661
This is from the real Donna.

21:02.662 --> 21:05.634
Here. Look at this.

21:05.635 --> 21:07.936
Her sleeve and the whole
right side of her jeans

21:07.937 --> 21:10.769
were saturated in this diluted

21:10.770 --> 21:12.270
acetic acid solution.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.773
Battery acid goes
everywhere in a car accident.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.345
No, it's not battery acid.

21:16.346 --> 21:17.846
It's a stop bath.

21:17.847 --> 21:19.848
It stops the action of
the developing solution

21:19.849 --> 21:21.850
when developing photographs.

21:21.851 --> 21:23.352
Who the hell does that anymore?

21:23.353 --> 21:24.853
I do.

21:24.854 --> 21:27.787
Why am I not surprised?

21:29.689 --> 21:31.591
It's a dying art, man.

21:34.964 --> 21:37.997
(People speaking indistinctly)

21:55.915 --> 21:57.416
Wow. Visiting you at work

21:57.417 --> 22:00.088
is a lot more satisfying
than the other way around.

22:00.089 --> 22:01.050
Yeah? Mm.

22:01.051 --> 22:02.421
Well, then we're
gonna have to work on

22:02.422 --> 22:03.592
your definition of "satisfying."

22:03.593 --> 22:05.924
(Chuckles) Okay.

22:05.925 --> 22:08.026
Here's your shot.

22:08.027 --> 22:11.329
There is this stupid
thing that I have to go to

22:11.330 --> 22:12.831
for work tonight.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.903
And I was thinking,
the one thing

22:14.904 --> 22:16.405
that might make
it more bearable,

22:16.406 --> 22:18.767
is if you came with me.

22:18.768 --> 22:19.968
(Chuckles) Wow.
Maybe. (Chuckles)

22:19.969 --> 22:22.340
Well, put it like that,
how can I refuse?

22:22.341 --> 22:24.714
Okay.

22:30.019 --> 22:33.121
Oh, typical
off-campus apartment.

22:33.122 --> 22:34.823
Nice building.

22:34.824 --> 22:36.825
Poor parents. I can't imagine.

22:36.826 --> 22:39.127
The relief of having
your child survive...

22:39.128 --> 22:41.660
Yeah, and then it gets
ripped right out from under you.

22:41.661 --> 22:44.993
I don't see a trove of
photography chemicals.

22:44.994 --> 22:46.896
Me neither.

22:49.439 --> 22:51.099
Four locks on the door?

22:51.100 --> 22:53.041
Bars on a second-story window?

22:53.042 --> 22:54.903
(Rattles handle)

22:54.904 --> 22:57.145
(Drawer clicks open)

22:57.146 --> 22:58.146
Hey.

22:59.549 --> 23:01.780
Pepper spray.

23:01.781 --> 23:03.783
This girl was afraid of someone.

23:09.919 --> 23:11.990
So are you going
to sleep with him?

23:11.991 --> 23:13.422
What?

23:13.423 --> 23:15.093
Well, I mean, it's been
a month now, right?

23:15.094 --> 23:17.125
Dad's already in Barbados
with that girl he's known like...

23:17.126 --> 23:18.697
Yes, yes, I know.

23:18.698 --> 23:21.399
No, and Aidan and I are
not going to sleep together.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.532
So dad having sex
means you can't have any?

23:23.533 --> 23:25.073
Well, why should
being divorced from him

23:25.074 --> 23:27.035
be any different than
being married to him?

23:27.036 --> 23:28.106
What's that mean?

23:28.107 --> 23:30.609
Nothing. Aidan and
I are taking our time,

23:30.610 --> 23:32.410
which is something I
would hope you would do

23:32.411 --> 23:34.082
until you're at least 40.

23:34.083 --> 23:35.014
Relax, mom. I get it.

23:35.015 --> 23:36.715
(Cell phone rings)

23:36.716 --> 23:39.648
(Ring)

23:39.649 --> 23:41.149
Go ahead, Peter.

23:41.150 --> 23:43.091
We just got done talking
to the campus police.

23:43.092 --> 23:44.623
Carrie had a stalker.

23:44.624 --> 23:45.794
She got letters

23:45.795 --> 23:47.826
and flowers and
photographs of her

23:47.827 --> 23:48.997
taken from around the campus,

23:48.998 --> 23:50.459
all sent anonymously.

23:50.460 --> 23:51.860
Then one day, she comes
home, and she swore

23:51.861 --> 23:53.201
that someone had
been sleeping in her bed,

23:53.202 --> 23:54.833
so she went to
the campus police.

23:54.834 --> 23:56.765
So creepy.

23:56.766 --> 23:58.767
Did the police do anything?

23:58.768 --> 24:01.139
Not much. She'd thrown
out all the letters and photos.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.211
They checked with all the
local photo processing places

24:03.212 --> 24:05.974
just the same, but they
came up with nothing.

24:05.975 --> 24:07.145
This sounds very strange.

24:07.146 --> 24:08.477
Why didn't the
greysons say something?

24:08.478 --> 24:11.019
My guess is that
Carrie never told them.

24:11.020 --> 24:12.521
I mean, you met her father.

24:12.522 --> 24:14.152
He would've yanked her
out of that school in seconds.

24:14.153 --> 24:16.185
Okay, thanks.

24:18.227 --> 24:20.759
(Man) The Philadelphia
medical association

24:20.760 --> 24:22.460
was founded in 1865

24:22.461 --> 24:25.564
with the goal of consolidating
new medical knowledge

24:25.565 --> 24:27.235
and procedures coming out of...

24:27.236 --> 24:29.197
This could possibly
be the worst date ever.

24:29.198 --> 24:31.169
I'm having a wonderful time.

24:31.170 --> 24:33.241
Oh, you are such
a liar. (Chuckles)

24:33.242 --> 24:34.203
(Laughs)

24:34.204 --> 24:36.505
No. Getting to
know the real you,

24:36.506 --> 24:38.176
which is all I
really care about.

24:38.177 --> 24:40.248
If this is the real
me, we're in trouble.

24:40.249 --> 24:41.850
Good.

24:41.851 --> 24:43.251
(Man) ...And has
focused on education,

24:43.252 --> 24:45.013
public service,

24:45.014 --> 24:46.755
and the popularization

24:46.756 --> 24:49.518
of the medical professional
community. What?

24:49.519 --> 24:52.821
To that end, we have
a number of awards

24:52.822 --> 24:54.492
to present tonight.
Where are we going?

24:54.493 --> 24:56.965
First up, it is my pleasure...
What about your award?

24:56.966 --> 25:00.669
To introduce the recipient
of our public service award,

25:00.670 --> 25:03.933
Dr. Megan hunt.

25:11.180 --> 25:14.212
(Megan chuckles)

25:14.213 --> 25:16.785
This is where

25:16.786 --> 25:19.688
I had my first real kiss.

25:19.689 --> 25:20.749
No.

25:20.750 --> 25:21.850
David faulkner.

25:21.851 --> 25:23.021
(Laughs)

25:23.022 --> 25:24.152
I was in tenth grade,

25:24.153 --> 25:26.625
and he was in eleventh.

25:26.626 --> 25:28.997
And did you break his heart?

25:28.998 --> 25:31.059
Um...

25:31.060 --> 25:32.801
Actually, I think I did.

25:32.802 --> 25:34.302
Of course you did. (Laughs)

25:34.303 --> 25:37.165
The first in a long
line, I've no doubt.

25:37.166 --> 25:39.037
No.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.239
There haven't been that many.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.672
I-I know what I want,

25:43.673 --> 25:45.644
and...

25:45.645 --> 25:47.576
I'm willing to wait.

25:47.577 --> 25:50.950
Are you still waiting?

25:52.181 --> 25:55.184
Just kiss me.

26:12.271 --> 26:15.274
(Woman singing
pop music indistinctly)

26:19.008 --> 26:22.050
Lace, it's time for bed, honey.

26:22.051 --> 26:25.714
♪ Uh-oh, here it comes again ♪

26:25.715 --> 26:27.986

26:27.987 --> 26:31.660
(Woman singing indistinctly)

26:31.661 --> 26:32.961
Lacey.

26:32.962 --> 26:35.824
Your mom would kill me

26:35.825 --> 26:37.365
if she knew you
were up this late.

26:37.366 --> 26:39.167

26:58.718 --> 27:00.218
(People speaking indistinctly)

27:00.219 --> 27:02.220
Mother. What happened?

27:02.221 --> 27:04.793
I-I went to tell her
to get ready for bed,

27:04.794 --> 27:06.755
and she was on the
floor unconscious.

27:06.756 --> 27:08.396
Did she hit her head?
Did she have a seizure?

27:08.397 --> 27:10.028
Megan, I don't know anything.

27:10.029 --> 27:12.230
Oh, god.

27:12.231 --> 27:14.062
You.

27:14.063 --> 27:15.333
My name is Dr. Megan hunt.

27:15.334 --> 27:16.805
I'm with the medical
examiner's office.

27:16.806 --> 27:18.636
My daughter Lacey
Fleming was admitted here

27:18.637 --> 27:20.108
a half an hour ago.

27:20.109 --> 27:21.810
I want to see the attendingnow.

27:21.811 --> 27:23.641
Ma'am, you don't
talk to me that way.

27:23.642 --> 27:26.274
And you certainly don't
summon my attending that way.

27:26.275 --> 27:28.977
Now sit your ass down, and he'll
be with you as soon as he can.

27:28.978 --> 27:31.920
I assume you're
talking about me.

27:31.921 --> 27:33.421
We meet again.

27:33.422 --> 27:34.422
My daughter... what happened?

27:34.423 --> 27:35.954
She collapsed from ketoacidosis.

27:35.955 --> 27:38.286
Her blood sugar
registered a 450.

27:38.287 --> 27:39.988
We found ketones in her urine.

27:39.989 --> 27:42.190
Now that combined
with islet cell antibodies,

27:42.191 --> 27:44.362
means there's a
high probability of...

27:44.363 --> 27:46.264
Type 1 diabetes.

27:46.265 --> 27:47.836
My brother has it.

27:47.837 --> 27:50.038
Diabetes?

27:50.039 --> 27:52.741
I know it's a shock, but
Lacey will be all right.

27:52.742 --> 27:54.242
The main thing right now

27:54.243 --> 27:56.374
is to get her blood sugar
level back to normal.

27:56.375 --> 27:57.746
We're moving her now.
Give us a few minutes,

27:57.747 --> 27:59.879
and a nurse will
take you to her.

28:08.758 --> 28:10.759
Donna whirley's heart
started bleeding last night.

28:10.760 --> 28:12.761
The doctors had no
choice but to operate.

28:12.762 --> 28:15.193
She's in recovery, and
you have your bullet.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.925
How is Lacey doing?

28:16.926 --> 28:20.298
A lot better than
Megan, I guarantee you.

28:20.299 --> 28:21.770
It's not a match.

28:21.771 --> 28:23.832
So Rob Martin is in the clear.

28:23.833 --> 28:25.904
And none of the accident victims

28:25.905 --> 28:28.737
saw Suzie foster's black
s.U.V. On the highway.

28:28.738 --> 28:30.438
Back to hunting for darkrooms.

28:30.439 --> 28:31.439
Darkrooms?

28:31.440 --> 28:33.411
Uh, Donna's shirt
and pants were soaked

28:33.412 --> 28:35.113
with an acid bath used
to develop photographs,

28:35.114 --> 28:36.885
and Carrie's stalker was
sending her photographs.

28:36.886 --> 28:39.387
So we figure that they
found out who he was

28:39.388 --> 28:41.289
and confronted
him in his darkroom.

28:41.290 --> 28:43.451
Only there are no commercial
darkrooms anymore.

28:43.452 --> 28:44.853
So how'd the girls find it?

28:44.854 --> 28:47.395
We don't know, but I want
to show you something.

28:47.396 --> 28:51.159
Okay, I am shooting you the
photograph right now. (Beeps)

28:51.160 --> 28:53.331
Something in that picture

28:53.332 --> 28:56.104
made Carrie grab
Donna out of a bar

28:56.105 --> 28:58.867
and drag her to
Carrie's eventual death.

28:58.868 --> 29:01.210
What?

29:04.473 --> 29:07.476
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

29:09.248 --> 29:10.418
Megan.

29:10.419 --> 29:12.020
Megan, enough.

29:12.021 --> 29:14.022
You're driving me nuts.

29:14.023 --> 29:15.954
And you're driving
yourself nuts.

29:15.955 --> 29:18.828
Honey, you need
to get some rest.

29:20.459 --> 29:24.363
(Beeping continues)

29:33.072 --> 29:36.075
(People speaking indistinctly)

29:40.109 --> 29:42.410
How is she?

29:42.411 --> 29:44.382
They think she's gonna make it.

29:44.383 --> 29:47.986
They're moving her
to her own room now.

29:47.987 --> 29:50.989
I just keep thinking about
how brave she's already been

29:50.990 --> 29:54.422
and how much braver
she's gonna have to be.

29:54.423 --> 29:57.095
Did Donna ever mention
that Carrie had a stalker?

29:57.096 --> 29:58.867
A stalker?

29:58.868 --> 30:00.498
No, never.

30:00.499 --> 30:02.270
Oh, god. Is that who did this?

30:02.271 --> 30:04.002
Maybe. We think that

30:04.003 --> 30:06.504
Carrie and Donna
confronted him together.

30:06.505 --> 30:08.336
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

30:08.337 --> 30:10.178
Carrie never wanted to be alone.

30:10.179 --> 30:11.480
Now I understand why.

30:13.582 --> 30:15.583
I-I don't know if this helps,

30:15.584 --> 30:17.585
but we found a box
in Donna's room...

30:17.586 --> 30:19.417
Carrie's keepsakes.

30:19.418 --> 30:20.919
Carrie must have, you know,

30:20.920 --> 30:23.451
given it to her for safekeeping.

30:23.452 --> 30:24.953
Where's the box?

30:24.954 --> 30:26.294
Well, it's right here.

30:26.295 --> 30:27.856
I mean, we were gonna
give it to the greysons,

30:27.857 --> 30:30.498
but it got a little heated as
I'm sure you heard. Mind?

30:30.499 --> 30:32.461
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.

30:35.564 --> 30:36.564
Thank you.

30:51.520 --> 30:53.251
(Bell jingles)

30:53.252 --> 30:57.026
(Chuckles)

31:06.996 --> 31:09.498
I have no idea what that is.

31:13.372 --> 31:16.044
Hey, did you hear about Lacey?

31:16.045 --> 31:17.375
Yeah. It's crazy, huh?

31:17.376 --> 31:18.876
She's gonna be fine.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.549
My lease runs out at
the end of next month.

31:21.550 --> 31:23.081
That's what made me think of it.

31:23.082 --> 31:25.083
I-I spend most nights
at your place anyway.

31:25.084 --> 31:26.915
You've gone from
"keep it casual"

31:26.916 --> 31:29.057
to "cohabitation" pretty
quickly, don't you think?

31:29.058 --> 31:31.489
Ay, dios mio! You guys
know I'm standing here, right?

31:31.490 --> 31:33.191
I follow my heart.

31:33.192 --> 31:35.193
Maybe... It's too
soon, Dani. That's all.

31:35.194 --> 31:37.025
I'm just invisible. When does
too soon become too late?

31:37.026 --> 31:39.267
(Chuckles) Maybe my... my
entire existence... I don't know. Uh...

31:39.268 --> 31:41.269
I'm just asking. Is completely
meaningless to everyone.

31:41.270 --> 31:42.570
I don't think you
were just asking me.

31:42.571 --> 31:44.432
I think that you're, you know...
Really? You really think...

31:44.433 --> 31:46.074
Kind of... i think you're
pushing me a little bit, you know?

31:46.075 --> 31:47.405
Pushing you?

31:47.406 --> 31:49.278
Hey, hey, perdon. ¿que es esto?

31:50.639 --> 31:52.140
What is this?

31:52.141 --> 31:53.581
That's a picture of the interns

31:53.582 --> 31:54.912
at the college museum.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.414
Okay, and... and
Carrie's stalker

31:56.415 --> 31:57.545
was sending her
photographs, right?

31:57.546 --> 31:58.916
Yeah.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.420
Mira! it's this guy.

32:04.653 --> 32:06.194
How the hell do you know that?

32:06.195 --> 32:08.326
His t-shirt. "The arbus center."

32:08.327 --> 32:09.497
It's an artist commune downtown.

32:09.498 --> 32:12.301
They develop their
photographs manually.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.338
Philly p.D.!

32:20.339 --> 32:23.642
Taking the stairs, partner!

32:50.639 --> 32:52.601
Hey, guys.

32:56.645 --> 32:58.676
(Morris) These are
all pictures of Carrie.

32:58.677 --> 33:00.378
(Peter) That's the hospital.

33:00.379 --> 33:02.750
That's Donna's room.

33:02.751 --> 33:05.713
What if he doesn't
know it's Donna?

33:05.714 --> 33:08.286
What if he still
thinks it's Carrie?

33:08.287 --> 33:10.088
He's gonna take her out.

33:10.089 --> 33:12.061
We've gotta get to the hospital.

33:29.678 --> 33:31.579
Um, excuse me.

33:31.580 --> 33:33.281
What are you doing?

33:33.282 --> 33:35.043
Just borrowing your microscope.

33:35.044 --> 33:36.344
(People speaking indistinctly)

33:36.345 --> 33:38.516
Okay, uh, I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

33:38.517 --> 33:40.288
This is hospital property, okay?

33:40.289 --> 33:41.649
Hey, listen.

33:41.650 --> 33:43.351
I'm about to catch a murderer.

33:43.352 --> 33:45.593
You want to cut me some slack?

33:45.594 --> 33:47.225
Okay.

33:47.226 --> 33:49.097
Yeah.

33:49.098 --> 33:51.559
What are you looking at?

33:51.560 --> 33:54.763
Fungus from the
fingernail of the killer.

34:00.609 --> 34:03.172
(Switch clicks) Hello, Suzie.

34:05.444 --> 34:08.416
What are you doing here?

34:08.417 --> 34:11.319
I'm just, uh, here
to visit a friend.

34:11.320 --> 34:12.620
Really?

34:12.621 --> 34:14.482
With a syringe in your hand.

34:14.483 --> 34:16.254
I'm just wondering

34:16.255 --> 34:18.256
how you went from
being in love with Carrie

34:18.257 --> 34:19.557
to wanting her dead.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.689
I was never in love with her.

34:21.690 --> 34:24.362
Come on, Suzie.

34:24.363 --> 34:27.135
You broke into her apartment,

34:27.136 --> 34:29.597
you laid down in her bed,

34:29.598 --> 34:31.639
you left trace of
the fingernail fungus

34:31.640 --> 34:33.341
on your left thumb.

34:33.342 --> 34:34.642
Yeah.

34:34.643 --> 34:37.805
I saw that in the
police station.

34:37.806 --> 34:39.577
Tell me...

34:39.578 --> 34:41.609
How did it feel to

34:41.610 --> 34:44.712
wrap yourself up
in her sheets, good?

34:44.713 --> 34:46.854
Carrie was supposed
to be my best friend,

34:46.855 --> 34:48.386
not Donna's.

34:48.387 --> 34:49.687
Oh.

34:49.688 --> 34:51.719
I was always there for her,
even if she didn't know it.

34:51.720 --> 34:53.391
Then she shows up with Donna,

34:53.392 --> 34:55.663
starts screaming at me
for what I've put her through.

34:55.664 --> 34:56.794
Me, her biggest fan.

34:56.795 --> 34:58.326
Right.

34:58.327 --> 35:02.099
I told her that Donna
had gotten between us.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.401
She laughed at me.

35:03.402 --> 35:04.702
She mocked me.

35:04.703 --> 35:07.605
Up until then, she'd been...

35:07.606 --> 35:09.437
Perfect.

35:09.438 --> 35:11.179
I'm so sorry.

35:11.180 --> 35:12.680
You shoulda seen
the look on their faces

35:12.681 --> 35:14.512
when I pulled out that gun.

35:14.513 --> 35:17.345
They weren't mocking me then.

35:17.346 --> 35:19.517
Suzie, you need help.

35:19.518 --> 35:22.720
This is 100%
glacial acetic acid.

35:22.721 --> 35:25.523
Do you know what it
does when it hits a vein?

35:25.524 --> 35:26.625
More than you do.

35:28.397 --> 35:30.358
(Glass shatters)

35:30.359 --> 35:31.559
(Grunts)

35:31.560 --> 35:35.133
(Grunting)

35:37.606 --> 35:38.807
Aah! Oh!

35:40.409 --> 35:43.471
(Panting) Ow!

35:43.472 --> 35:45.573
You okay?

35:45.574 --> 35:46.744
(Grunts)

35:46.745 --> 35:47.775
(Morris) Get her
out of here, Sam.

35:47.776 --> 35:49.418
(Handcuffs click) (Grunts)

35:51.720 --> 35:53.721
You're not suing the
medical examiner's office

35:53.722 --> 35:55.423
or the city.

35:55.424 --> 35:56.584
The hell I'm not.

35:56.585 --> 35:57.855
It'll take years,
and you'll lose.

35:57.856 --> 36:00.628
Do you really want to
relive that pain every day

36:00.629 --> 36:03.431
and still have no resolution?

36:03.432 --> 36:06.634
Lady, I'll relive it
until the day I die.

36:06.635 --> 36:08.336
Of course.

36:08.337 --> 36:09.837
But what if...

36:09.838 --> 36:12.800
There were a way to
ease some of that pain?

36:12.801 --> 36:15.504
What do you mean?

36:22.681 --> 36:23.752
What are they doing here?

36:27.356 --> 36:31.189
Carrie gave this to
Donna to keep for her.

36:33.662 --> 36:34.823
(Latch clicks)

36:44.703 --> 36:45.903
When I was Carrie's age,

36:45.904 --> 36:47.905
I used to have a
box like that, too...

36:47.906 --> 36:51.809
Old concert tickets, my
grandmother's watch.

36:51.810 --> 36:55.714
But I never had a friend
that I would entrust it to.

36:57.246 --> 36:59.317
Carrie wasn't a bad influence.

36:59.318 --> 37:01.589
We know that now. She was a...

37:01.590 --> 37:03.721
Good girl, a good friend.

37:03.722 --> 37:06.425
And when she needed
help, she turned to Donna.

37:08.427 --> 37:10.458
(Clears throat)
You've all suffered.

37:10.459 --> 37:13.631
You've all had your
worlds turned upside down.

37:13.632 --> 37:16.764
For 36 hours, the whirleys
thought their daughter was dead.

37:16.765 --> 37:20.438
And for 36 hours, you
cared for Donna as your own.

37:20.439 --> 37:22.770
Out of this tragedy,
one girl has survived,

37:22.771 --> 37:25.743
and she has all
four of you to thank

37:25.744 --> 37:28.476
for the love and the
support that she's gotten,

37:28.477 --> 37:31.719
and she is gonna need every
bit of that love and support

37:31.720 --> 37:35.723
to help her come to terms
with losing her best friend.

37:35.724 --> 37:37.786
Don't you want to
be a part of that?

37:39.628 --> 37:41.859
Do we want to be a part of what?

37:41.860 --> 37:44.733
A part of our daughter's life.

37:46.865 --> 37:49.798
Please.

37:59.878 --> 38:01.749
Yes.

38:01.750 --> 38:04.413
Yes, we do.

38:15.724 --> 38:17.064
(Megan) Hey.

38:17.065 --> 38:19.927
Hi.

38:19.928 --> 38:21.769
So... (Sighs)

38:21.770 --> 38:24.802
The real me... you got
quite a dose last night.

38:24.803 --> 38:27.034
(Chuckles) How's Lacey?

38:27.035 --> 38:28.636
She's okay.

38:28.637 --> 38:30.077
She's gonna be in the
hospital for a couple more days.

38:30.078 --> 38:31.879
Which is where you should be.

38:31.880 --> 38:34.482
And, no, nothing
about last night's

38:34.483 --> 38:35.783
gonna scare me off,

38:35.784 --> 38:38.616
if that's what you
were wondering.

38:38.617 --> 38:39.787
(Snaps)

38:39.788 --> 38:41.089
Here.

38:42.691 --> 38:45.052
Give that to Lacey.

38:45.053 --> 38:47.355
Are you really this perfect?

38:47.356 --> 38:49.026
No. (Laughs)

38:49.027 --> 38:51.799
(Laughs) Thank god.

38:51.800 --> 38:55.704
Now stop distracting my boys
and get the hell outta here.

39:02.871 --> 39:04.872
(Knocks on doorjamb)

39:04.873 --> 39:08.015
Commissioner Travers,
nice to see you again.

39:08.016 --> 39:09.877
I've asked Kate to join us.

39:09.878 --> 39:11.419
The misidentification

39:11.420 --> 39:13.421
of Carrie Greyson
and Donna whirley

39:13.422 --> 39:16.083
is a big black
eye for this office.

39:16.084 --> 39:17.455
How do you figure?

39:17.456 --> 39:18.956
We weren't the
first on the scene,

39:18.957 --> 39:20.458
or the second or third.

39:20.459 --> 39:22.860
Your m.E. Had the
body for a day and a half

39:22.861 --> 39:25.092
without noticing the mistake.

39:25.093 --> 39:26.934
In all fairness, Megan
had no reason to think

39:26.935 --> 39:28.095
there'd been a mistake.

39:28.096 --> 39:30.898
Come on. You
know the game, Kate.

39:30.899 --> 39:32.600
By the way,

39:32.601 --> 39:35.042
how'd you get the greysons
to drop their lawsuit?

39:35.043 --> 39:37.905
I just appealed to the
goodness of their nature.

39:37.906 --> 39:40.908
(Chuckles) Well, whatever
you said, it worked.

39:40.909 --> 39:42.910
And now we have an image problem

39:42.911 --> 39:44.912
with only one solution.

39:44.913 --> 39:47.014
Where is Megan hunt?

39:47.015 --> 39:50.387
Mnh-mnh. She's not
taking the fall for this.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.920
This is my office
and my responsibility.

39:52.921 --> 39:55.092
Curtis...

39:55.093 --> 39:57.965
You realize what you're saying?

39:57.966 --> 39:59.868
We got the killer, didn't we?

40:01.630 --> 40:03.130
Congratulations...

40:03.131 --> 40:06.103
Kate.

40:06.104 --> 40:09.438
You're chief again.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.613
That was very noble of you.

40:15.614 --> 40:16.884
You'd have done the same.

40:16.885 --> 40:18.916
You all right?

40:18.917 --> 40:20.818
I'm fine.

40:20.819 --> 40:21.989
At least now

40:21.990 --> 40:24.421
I don't have to deal with
Megan's award ceremony.

40:24.422 --> 40:25.993
Why? What did she do this time?

40:25.994 --> 40:27.926
(Laughs)

40:34.763 --> 40:37.705
(Crying) Mom, I'm so scared.

40:37.706 --> 40:39.707
I know you are, honey.

40:39.708 --> 40:40.938
I know.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.971
How could I even have
diabetes? I'm not overweight.

40:43.972 --> 40:46.173
That's type 2 diabetes.
It's... it's acquired.

40:46.174 --> 40:47.915
Yours is different.

40:47.916 --> 40:50.047
It's still incurable, right?

40:50.048 --> 40:52.950
And I'm gonna, like,
lose my legs or go blind?

40:52.951 --> 40:54.722
Lacey, listen to me.

40:54.723 --> 40:57.224
You forget everything
that you have ever heard

40:57.225 --> 40:58.926
about diabetes, okay?

40:58.927 --> 41:01.158
Those are misconceptions.

41:01.159 --> 41:05.633
It is a completely
manageable condition.

41:05.634 --> 41:10.768
And I am gonna be with
you every step of the way.
