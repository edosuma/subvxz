-Los Angeles and it's a lot of lessons.
-[whoos of agreement]

04:22.971 --> 04:25.682
A lot of lessons
that I had to learn the hard way

04:25.765 --> 04:29.185
because I really didn't have no
one particular person to raise me.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.770
The world raised me.

04:30.853 --> 04:33.648
And I've learned a lot of things.
I'm here tonight to share with you.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.862

[clicks tongue, clears throat]
it was really hard for me to breathe

04:46.536 --> 04:47.996

05:07.307 --> 05:08.474

[puffs in mic, laughs]
my inheritance was that DNA.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.863

[whooping]

05:35.835 --> 05:37.837
[clapping]

05:39.881 --> 05:43.676
But I knew that if things
are getting a little out of control

05:43.968 --> 05:47.180
when I would walk around the house
with no panties on

05:47.263 --> 05:50.099
and I would hear round of applause.
I would hear clapping.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.225
[audience laughs]

05:51.434 --> 05:55.813
I was like, who is clapping in here?
Who is-- who is clapping over here?

05:55.897 --> 05:56.898
It was my ass.

05:56.981 --> 05:58.566
-It was my ass.
-[whooping]

05:58.649 --> 06:01.235

06:03.363 --> 06:06.199
-[inhales, steadily exhales]
-[continued laughing]

06:06.783 --> 06:10.661
You know, what's crazy is Ms. Tina,
Ms. Tina Knowles-Lawson,

06:11.746 --> 06:12.705
Beyoncé mama.

06:13.122 --> 06:13.956
She had invited me--

06:14.040 --> 06:15.750
I got invited
to her birthday party, right?

06:15.833 --> 06:17.543
But she didn't invite me,
somebody else had.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.962
They didn't know I was gonna be there.
So what happened was--

06:20.046 --> 06:21.964
[whooing, laughing]

06:22.048 --> 06:22.924
[clapping]

06:23.049 --> 06:24.967
I was at the birthday party, right?

06:25.051 --> 06:27.845
And Beyoncé had came in.
And her suit was banging.

06:27.929 --> 06:30.556
And I was like,
"Oh my God, this suit is amazing!"

06:30.640 --> 06:32.392
She said the suit was
from Christian Siriano.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.435
I was like,
"Christian Siriano made that suit?

06:34.519 --> 06:36.020
Oh, I know Christian Siriano.

06:36.104 --> 06:38.356
-I'mma ask him to make me a suit too."
-[audience chuckles]

06:38.439 --> 06:39.899
She's like, "Okay." So then...

06:40.024 --> 06:41.067
[audience howls]

06:41.192 --> 06:43.403
When he sent me the suit, right?
He gave it to me

06:43.486 --> 06:44.862
fresh off the runway, right?

06:44.946 --> 06:47.907
I couldn't even pull it up on my thighs
or nothing. It didn't fit.

06:48.032 --> 06:50.743
So I was like kind of devastated.
So then I thought to myself,

06:50.827 --> 06:52.662
"Let me call Beyoncé mama.

06:52.745 --> 06:55.623
Just take a shot in the dark to see
if she let me borrow that suit, right?"

06:55.706 --> 06:56.874
So I called Beyoncé mama.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.961
I said, "Hey, Ms. Tina, how you doing?

07:00.086 --> 07:01.003
[audience laughs]

07:01.129 --> 07:05.091
You know that suit that Beyoncé was
wearing that night at the party,

07:05.341 --> 07:07.718
do you think that Beyoncé
will let me borrow it?"

07:07.802 --> 07:10.847
She was like, "You know what's crazy?
She was talking about gifting that to you.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.932
But I don't know
if you going to be able to fit it.

07:13.015 --> 07:15.643
You know, Beyoncé had three kids
and you didn't have none."

07:15.726 --> 07:17.854
-I was like...
-[roaring whoos]

07:18.146 --> 07:20.440
-Well...

07:21.399 --> 07:23.192
We'll see, you know.

07:23.526 --> 07:24.944
[audience cackling]

07:25.111 --> 07:26.487
We'll see, I-- [blows lips]

07:26.821 --> 07:29.574
Girl, I got a needle and thread.
Don't worry about that.

07:29.740 --> 07:31.033
[laughter]

07:31.200 --> 07:32.785
So then, she called Beyoncé.

07:32.869 --> 07:36.831
The next day, the suit is at my house.
The suit is like at my front door.

07:36.914 --> 07:37.915
I was like, "Oh my God.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.835
-Beyoncé is the most dopest person
-[uproarious cheering]

07:40.918 --> 07:43.838
-in the whole wide world!"
-[whistling in agreement]

07:44.088 --> 07:47.133
Beyoncé is the epitome
of women supporting other women.

07:47.216 --> 07:48.885
That's girl power to the fullest,

07:48.968 --> 07:51.762
like, she supporting other women.
That's what I love about her, right?

07:51.846 --> 07:55.975
And then, I had put the suit on.
And it fit me perfectly!

07:56.058 --> 07:58.352
It was a little loose in the titties
'cuz I don't have none.

07:58.436 --> 08:00.480
-[audience laughing]
-But it fit me perfectly, right?

08:00.563 --> 08:03.191
It fit me perfectly.
So then, I called Beyoncé mama, said,

08:03.274 --> 08:06.360
"Hey, Ms. Tina. It fit perfect.
The suit fit perfect."

08:06.444 --> 08:07.487
She was like, "It do?"

08:07.570 --> 08:09.697
I said, "Yeah, it was a little loose
on the breast area

08:09.780 --> 08:11.199
but everything else fits perfectly."

08:11.324 --> 08:13.618
And she was like, "For real?"
I was like, "Yeah."

08:13.701 --> 08:15.453
She was like, "Wow, I'm shocked."

08:15.536 --> 08:18.748
-[audience laughs]
-I was like, "Shots fired, Ms. Tina!"

08:18.831 --> 08:21.083
-[audience laughing]
-[Haddish chuckles]

08:22.126 --> 08:25.004
So my homegirl's like,
"We should go to the gym.

08:25.087 --> 08:27.507
Let's go to the gym.
Like, your body used to be banging.

08:27.590 --> 08:30.176
You was a track star.
Used to run cross-country,

08:30.259 --> 08:31.677
used to do all these things.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.846
Get that body back.
Get back in the gym, Tiffany.

08:33.929 --> 08:34.889
Get back in the gym."

08:34.972 --> 08:38.851
I said, "I became a comedian so that
I could get fat if I felt like it bitch."

08:38.934 --> 08:40.645
[roars of laughter]

08:40.770 --> 08:42.355

08:43.147 --> 08:45.149

I can smoke some weed up here
and that's totally legal.

18:21.850 --> 18:25.020
They turned into jackasses.
That's what the fuck happened to me!

18:25.104 --> 18:27.147
-[roaring laughter]
-My friend called me, she's like,

18:27.231 --> 18:28.607
"Tiffany, come on, let's go out."

18:28.690 --> 18:31.110
I'm like, "Nah, girl. I gotta go to bed."
She's like, "Tiffany,

18:32.236 --> 18:33.904
have you celebrated this year?"

18:34.029 --> 18:35.989
I was like, "What do you mean?
Have I celebrated?"

18:36.073 --> 18:37.116
"Did you celebrate?"

18:37.366 --> 18:38.283
[laughing]

18:38.367 --> 18:40.953
"Celebrate what, bitch?
What are you talking about?"

18:41.411 --> 18:42.830
-[laughing]
-"Tiffany.

18:43.622 --> 18:48.460
You was the very first African American
female stand-up comedian to host SNL.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.546
-And you won an Emmy for that.
-[cheering]

18:50.629 --> 18:53.132
-You won an Emmy for it!
-[continued cheering]

18:53.423 --> 18:54.675
Did you celebrate?

18:54.883 --> 18:59.972
Did you celebrate, Tiffany?"
I said, "No. I went to my next job

19:00.055 --> 19:02.391
trying to get an Emmy
for that motherfucker."

19:02.474 --> 19:03.433
[laughter]

19:03.642 --> 19:04.518
She said, "Okay.

19:05.102 --> 19:07.563
But you was in a movie with Kevin Hart

19:07.646 --> 19:10.691
and it made
over a hundred million dollars.

19:10.774 --> 19:11.775
[audience whoos]

19:11.900 --> 19:14.611
You was in a movie
that made a hundred million dollars.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.363
Did you go out to celebrate that,
Tiffany?"

19:16.446 --> 19:17.698
I said, "No--

19:17.781 --> 19:19.158
You know what? Yes, I did.

19:19.241 --> 19:21.660
I celebrated by cashing that check
from that movie

19:21.743 --> 19:23.245
-that made a hundred million."
-[whoos]

19:23.328 --> 19:24.830
-That was my celebration.
-[clapping]

19:24.955 --> 19:27.207
-Thank you. Check it!
-[laughter]

19:29.251 --> 19:30.502
She said, "But Tiffany,

19:31.420 --> 19:34.673
when you were 16, you could not read.
You learned how to read.

19:34.756 --> 19:35.799
And then you wrote a book.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.343
And it came out and it was
on the New York's Best Seller's list.

19:38.802 --> 19:42.181
You did an audio book. And that was
on the New York's Best Seller's list.

19:42.264 --> 19:46.185
And you got nominated for a Grammy
for reading out loud, bitch!

19:46.268 --> 19:47.936
-[uproarious laughter]
-Did you celebrate?

19:48.020 --> 19:49.271
Did you celebrate?

19:49.354 --> 19:52.149
-[cheering]
-Gettin' the Grammy for reading out loud.

19:52.232 --> 19:55.027
Do you know how inspiring that is
to people that hate readin'?

19:55.110 --> 19:57.738
Bitch, there's people out here
who can't see that can read.

19:57.821 --> 20:00.407
Now they finna be reading,
to get Grammys!"

20:00.490 --> 20:01.491
[laughter]

20:01.617 --> 20:02.492
I said, "Girl.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.704
No, I'm not working on
my Hooked on Phonics program

20:05.829 --> 20:08.123
so I can write a better book
that's more eloquent."

20:08.207 --> 20:09.166
[audience laughs]

20:09.291 --> 20:10.459
She said, "Tiffany.

20:12.002 --> 20:13.629
It's gonna be a gang of dick
in the club."

20:13.712 --> 20:16.006
I said, "You should've just said that
in the first place!"

20:16.089 --> 20:18.133
[howling laughter]

20:18.217 --> 20:19.092
[clapping]

20:19.218 --> 20:20.135
[whoos]

20:20.385 --> 20:24.056
I was out there partying my ass off,
dancing, drinking,

20:24.139 --> 20:26.934
drinking more than I ever drank
in my whole entire life.

20:27.017 --> 20:28.310
I was drinking everything.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.312
Anything somebody handed to me,
I was drinking it.

20:30.395 --> 20:34.024
Man, I was so messed up,
my kidneys failed on me. I was... [sighs]

20:34.107 --> 20:35.734
I'm pretty sure I peed in the Uber.

20:35.817 --> 20:37.945
-I know my Uber rating went down.
-[roaring laughter]

20:38.528 --> 20:39.863
Got me to the hotel.

20:39.988 --> 20:43.867
Boom, I went to sleep, right?
They wake me up in the middle of the day,

20:43.992 --> 20:45.994
said, "Tiffany, you got to do a video.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.038
You got to do a video
to let everybody know

20:48.163 --> 20:51.166
where you gonna be at tonight.
Got to let everybody know."

20:51.250 --> 20:55.045
And I said, "Oh, okay.
But I don't feel so good. [groans]

20:55.128 --> 20:56.380
I don't think I should do it."

20:56.463 --> 20:58.465
They said, "Get out in the sun.
You can do it."

20:58.548 --> 21:01.843
If you see this video,
this video will tell you

21:01.927 --> 21:04.179
this is not gonna be a good show.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.641
-[roaring laughter]
-This show is gonna be horrible.

21:07.724 --> 21:10.269
I didn't know where the fuck
I was gonna be performing at.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.186
It was bad.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.772
It was just a...
It was another bad choice.

21:13.897 --> 21:15.399
It's a bad idea. Just look.

21:16.066 --> 21:18.318
-What up, y'all. This is me, Tiffany.
- [screaming laughter]

21:18.402 --> 21:20.612

-I can't open my eyes, y'all.
-[laughter]

21:28.662 --> 21:31.290
Not even that, I partied all morning.

21:31.456 --> 21:32.666
I went to bed at seven.

21:33.208 --> 21:35.377
It's whatever time it is right now.

21:47.764 --> 21:50.475
-I forget the name of the theater.
- [roaring laughter]

21:51.310 --> 21:54.563
Go to my website Tiffanyhaddish.com,

-[laughter]

22:26.178 --> 22:27.554
She not ready.

22:27.637 --> 22:29.765
Anybody with any common sense
is gonna be like,

22:29.848 --> 22:30.932
"That show's gonna be bad.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.976
She don't even know

22:33.060 --> 22:33.935
[laughing]

22:34.019 --> 22:36.104
Wind blowin' through
my partial weave,

22:36.188 --> 22:37.898
-two tracks slapping in the back.
-[laughing]

22:37.981 --> 22:39.983
You can barely see it,
but it's back there flapping.

22:40.692 --> 22:43.528
Horrible. I go back to sleep.

22:43.612 --> 22:46.406
They wake me up,
"Tiffany, it's time to get to the theater.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.325
Get to the theater,
"We gotta do your makeup."

22:48.408 --> 22:50.452
I can't sit up.
I can't sit up in the chair straight.

22:50.535 --> 22:51.870
They said, "Lay on the couch."

22:51.953 --> 22:53.955
It was like they was getting me ready
for my funeral.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.624
-I was just laying there dead.
-[laughter]

22:56.875 --> 22:59.628
[howling laughter]

23:10.722 --> 23:12.724
[uproarious laughter]

23:25.695 --> 23:28.448
Come on. You gotta get to the stage."
They get me to the stage.

23:28.615 --> 23:29.908
I hear them announce me.

23:30.158 --> 23:31.660
Right before the announcement,

23:31.743 --> 23:34.913
you know, the comic on stage was killing.
They killing. I'm like,

23:34.996 --> 23:37.124

Said, "You sold out this theater, Tiffany.
You sold it out.

23:58.353 --> 24:00.188

Over 4000 people standing on their feet,
cheering for me.

24:24.671 --> 24:29.134
All these cellphone lights,
3000 cellphone lights up in the air,

24:29.217 --> 24:31.887
making it even brighter.
And I'm looking out.

24:32.471 --> 24:33.680
And my soul looking out.

24:34.264 --> 24:35.307
[laughter]

24:35.515 --> 24:37.934
And my soul looked at me and said,
"Bye, bitch."

24:38.018 --> 24:40.103
[uproarious laughter]

24:40.312 --> 24:41.563
[clapping]

24:41.771 --> 24:43.106
I said, "Wait!

24:45.192 --> 24:47.944
She said, "Mm-mm, we don't do cellphones.
Cellphones be snitching.

24:48.028 --> 24:49.863
-We don't do that.

Why y'all shit locked up."

24:57.078 --> 24:58.914
[clapping fading]

24:59.039 --> 25:02.042
The next day, the next day, right?
[laughs] The next day,

25:02.417 --> 25:04.169
I get home. I go to sleep.

25:04.544 --> 25:05.504
I wake up.

25:06.046 --> 25:07.547
When I open up my phone,

25:07.839 --> 25:12.093
it's like on the front page of Google:
"Tiffany Haddish bombs in Miami,

25:12.177 --> 25:15.305
does a horrible New Year's Eve show.
Oh my God, it's horrible."

25:15.388 --> 25:18.183
Right? I'm just like, "Oh, well."
I just tweeted, "Yeah, this happened.

25:18.266 --> 25:19.100
I'm so sorry.

25:19.184 --> 25:21.978
I'll make sure I prayed on it.
I'll make sure this never happens again."

25:22.062 --> 25:24.356
Right? And I leave it alone. Hours later,

25:24.439 --> 25:26.399
I started getting these phone calls.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.068
First, Kevin Hart calls me.

25:28.193 --> 25:30.070
-[affected accent] "Tiffany!
-[audience laughs]

25:30.195 --> 25:31.112

I said, "Yeah, I'm good."

25:32.280 --> 25:33.907
"You sure?"
I said, "Yeah, I'm sure."

25:33.990 --> 25:36.326
He said, "You ain't gonna kill yourself
or nothing, are you?"

25:36.409 --> 25:39.913
I said, "No. Why would I kill myself?"
"Shit. I'm just sayin'." [blows lips]

25:39.996 --> 25:40.997
[chuckles] "What?

25:41.081 --> 25:43.291
[indistinct vocalizations]

25:43.458 --> 25:45.043
[hissing, coughing]

25:45.293 --> 25:46.878
[indistinct vocalizations]

25:47.045 --> 25:49.381
The fuck? Kevin?
Are you dodging tennis balls?

25:49.464 --> 25:51.508
-Why are you making this noise?"
-[audience laughs]

25:52.842 --> 25:55.136
"Just making sure you're good."
"I'm good, Kevin. I'm good."

25:55.220 --> 25:56.513
"All right. All right."

25:56.596 --> 25:58.056
Click. He hanged up.

25:58.223 --> 25:59.224
Then I get a call--

26:00.100 --> 26:01.518
Oprah Winfrey.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.895
-[audience whoos]
-Oprah Winfrey calls me.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.397

26:08.733 --> 26:11.152
I know that you're gonna have
better shows."

26:11.319 --> 26:14.573
I said, "Thank you, Oprah.
When we're gonna start gardening?"

26:14.656 --> 26:16.533
"Gotta call you back. Bye!"

26:16.616 --> 26:18.118
[audience laughs]

26:19.953 --> 26:21.413
Then Martin Luther King called me.

26:21.496 --> 26:23.248
-I said, "Well, God damn!
-[laughing]

26:23.331 --> 26:25.875
I'm bringing the dead back
with my bad-ass show?"

26:25.959 --> 26:27.002
[howling laughter]

26:27.961 --> 26:29.212
[clapping, whooing]

26:29.504 --> 26:31.756
Now here's the crazy thing.
Here's the crazy thing.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.174
Sinbad called me.

26:33.341 --> 26:37.304
Now, to me,
that is fucking amazing. Sinbad!

26:37.387 --> 26:39.264
He's a legend. And my mom,

26:39.389 --> 26:41.766
my mom is in love with Sinbad.
When I was growing up,

26:41.850 --> 26:44.561
my mom was pretty mean to me, right?
She used to say stuff to me like,

26:44.644 --> 26:47.230
"Dang, you bald-headed on the side.
I can see your thoughts."

26:47.314 --> 26:49.274
-I'm like, "Damn, mom!
-[roaring laughs]

26:49.566 --> 26:50.442
You did my hair."

26:50.525 --> 26:52.694
"Who dressed you?
You look like a dirty little kid."

26:52.819 --> 26:54.863
-"You dressed me! You, mama!"
-[laughing]

26:55.238 --> 26:57.991
She said some mean stuff to me,
like "You look like your ugly-ass daddy.

26:58.074 --> 27:00.577
You ain't gonna be shit."
Well, look at me now, bitch. [cackles]

27:00.785 --> 27:02.454
[cheering]

27:02.746 --> 27:04.748
[clapping]

27:07.667 --> 27:10.795
I started thinking to myself,
"My mama, she might be mean to me.

27:10.879 --> 27:13.923
But the only reason she's mean to me
is because she knows

27:14.007 --> 27:15.925
that I'm the better version of her.

27:16.259 --> 27:17.677
[laughing]

27:18.094 --> 27:20.263
It's like she's Pic 'N' Save,

27:20.555 --> 27:21.848
and I'm Big Lots.

27:21.973 --> 27:23.683
[roaring laughter, cheers]

27:25.727 --> 27:26.561
[Haddish laughs]

27:28.605 --> 27:30.565
She was in love with Sinbad.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.651
She used to talk about Sinbad
all the time, right?

27:32.734 --> 27:36.321
So when he called me,
my first thought was,

27:36.571 --> 27:39.783
"I should fuck Sinbad, get pregnant,
and make my mama babysit."

27:40.116 --> 27:42.118
[audience laughs]

27:47.707 --> 27:49.709
That's the ultimate revenge right there.

27:50.126 --> 27:51.378
[laughing]

27:51.670 --> 27:54.172
But then I was like,
"Nah, he probably too old."

27:54.631 --> 27:56.341
[laughter]

27:56.591 --> 27:57.967
But then we started to talk, right?

27:58.051 --> 28:00.095
He said, "Tiffany, how you doing?
How you holding up?"

28:00.178 --> 28:03.139
I said, "I'm good. I'm holding up good."
He said, "Let me tell you something.

28:03.223 --> 28:04.641
I had shows on New Year's Eve too.

28:04.724 --> 28:07.686
And I did bad, man. Two shows.
Both of them were really bad."

28:07.769 --> 28:11.064
I said, "For real?" He said, "Yeah, man.
But, you know, what's crazy is,

28:11.147 --> 28:13.566
nobody talked about my show.
So, you know what that means."

28:13.650 --> 28:17.028
I said, "What?" He said, "Cuz you know,
they all talked about you."

28:17.112 --> 28:19.572
I said, "Yeah?"
He said, "That means you made it.

28:19.656 --> 28:20.657
You a star."

28:21.241 --> 28:23.493
[whooing, clapping]

28:29.916 --> 28:32.919
[cheering intensifies]

28:33.795 --> 28:36.381
[whoos]

28:41.052 --> 28:42.887
But it's crazy 'cuz like,

28:43.221 --> 28:46.599
[stammering] I'm so always like...
I have a big heart.

28:46.683 --> 28:48.935
And I feel... I think I feel everything.

28:49.018 --> 28:50.103
Like, [clicks tongue]

28:50.645 --> 28:51.479
three weeks ago,

28:51.563 --> 28:54.941
I was asleep, right? Sleeping good.
Then in the middle of the night,

28:55.024 --> 28:58.236
two o'clock in the morning,
I wake up. And my heart was so hurt.

28:58.319 --> 28:59.279
I was just hurting.

28:59.487 --> 29:02.031
I don't know why. And I went ahead,
and I tweeted about it, right?

29:02.115 --> 29:04.951
I said,  "I don't know what's going on.
I don't know why I woke up crying.

29:05.034 --> 29:07.120
But I feel much better now
that I prayed about it.

29:07.203 --> 29:09.164
And I went back to sleep, right?
When I woke up--

29:09.247 --> 29:10.999
This is how I know I'm famous.
When I woke up,

29:11.082 --> 29:13.418
that shit was on the front page
of my Google again,

29:13.501 --> 29:15.962
talking about
"Tiffany Haddish claims depression.

29:16.045 --> 29:18.506
It says crying was cathartic."
I was like, "First of...

29:18.590 --> 29:20.300
[intensifies]
What the fuck is 'cathartic'?

29:20.383 --> 29:22.051
-[audience laughs]
-Ain't no body says shit

29:22.135 --> 29:23.720
about catharticism.

29:23.803 --> 29:26.931
Okay? I don't even know
what religion that is!"

29:27.056 --> 29:29.058
[roaring laughter]

29:29.517 --> 29:32.604
Then I looked it up
and I was like, "Oh...

29:32.687 --> 29:35.732
-[laughter]
-Okay, 'cathartic'. Alright."

29:35.815 --> 29:38.151
But I didn't say I was depressed.
And I know,

29:38.234 --> 29:40.695
I know what depression is, first-hand.

29:40.779 --> 29:43.406
I know. I was homeless
three different times in my life.

29:43.531 --> 29:47.368
I know what the fuck depression is.
And they even gave me medication for it.

29:47.452 --> 29:50.705
I'mma tell you right now, alright?
I don't like that medication.

29:50.789 --> 29:54.626
I don't like it at all.
I rather be moist and crazy... [exhales]

29:54.918 --> 29:56.336
[laughing]

29:56.628 --> 29:59.672
than dry and sane.
That medication dry you up!

29:59.756 --> 30:00.965
[cheering, clapping]

30:01.132 --> 30:02.050
They dry you up!

30:02.592 --> 30:04.052
[whooing]

30:04.344 --> 30:08.473
Do you know how hard it is to walk fast
when your coochie dry?

30:08.556 --> 30:09.432
[laughter]

30:10.183 --> 30:12.936
You ever see them older ladies
try to cross the street?

30:13.061 --> 30:15.480
They had to hunch in like that.
They crawled up like a shrimp.

30:15.563 --> 30:16.898
-Like this, right here.
-[cackling]

30:16.981 --> 30:18.858
When they crawled up
like that right there,

30:18.942 --> 30:21.277
-that mean they coochie dry.
-[audience laughs]

30:21.486 --> 30:23.696
You gotta walk with your legs
cocked open like this.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.740
-You gotta walk slow.
-[laughing, clapping]

30:26.491 --> 30:28.701
'Cuz if you move fast,
your coochie's just gonna blow up.

30:28.785 --> 30:29.911
[puffs into mic]

30:29.994 --> 30:31.621
-[laughing]
-It's gonna catch on fire.

30:31.955 --> 30:34.040
-Gotta put Carmex on your lips and shit.
-[whooing]

30:34.123 --> 30:35.750
[audience laughs]

30:37.919 --> 30:40.463
-Sorry, that was funny to me.
-[laughter]

30:41.089 --> 30:43.216
I did that one time. It tingled too much.

30:43.299 --> 30:44.843
[screaming cackles]

30:45.260 --> 30:47.428
Carmex is not for your coochie lips,
just so you know.

30:47.679 --> 30:48.888
[audience laughs]

30:49.305 --> 30:51.224
They should put that on the container.

30:51.599 --> 30:53.226
[laughing]

30:54.477 --> 30:57.230
But it was crazy to me
'cuz people keep talking about it,

30:57.313 --> 31:00.108
they were talking about it like,
"Oh, Tiffany's claiming her depression."

31:00.191 --> 31:01.568
And I was not depressed.

31:01.651 --> 31:03.778
I just felt hurt for a moment.

31:03.903 --> 31:08.616
And I cried and I think personally, me,
I believe that crying is a removal

31:08.700 --> 31:09.534
of old beliefs

31:09.617 --> 31:11.661
and a replacement of new ones.

31:11.744 --> 31:13.872
You gotta remember,
see, we were all born crying.

31:13.955 --> 31:15.582
That was your first mode of communication.

31:15.665 --> 31:17.417
That's the first way
you communicate, crying.

31:17.500 --> 31:20.336
Like babies, that's their first way
to communicate, right?

31:20.420 --> 31:22.046
Nobody goes,

31:22.130 --> 31:24.966
the baby be in the bed, sleeping.
The baby's like--

31:25.049 --> 31:26.968
[wailing]

31:27.051 --> 31:28.011
[giggling]

31:28.136 --> 31:29.429
-Nobody's like,
-[laughing]

31:29.721 --> 31:31.681
-"That baby is manic.
-[continued laughing]

31:32.348 --> 31:34.517
Somebody get that baby
some Paxil, please."

31:34.642 --> 31:35.852
[howling laughter]

31:36.728 --> 31:38.730
[clapping]

31:42.108 --> 31:45.194
[chuckles] But nobody says
those babies need therapy.

31:45.612 --> 31:48.907
Nobody says those babies need
any kind of drugs.

31:49.032 --> 31:53.703
All they say is "Hold the baby.
Love the baby. Talk to the baby.

31:53.786 --> 31:55.872
Communicate with the baby."

31:56.039 --> 32:00.418
So what does that say that we need?
Somebody to hold us sometimes, love on us,

32:00.501 --> 32:01.753
-communicate with us.
-[cheering]

32:01.836 --> 32:03.713
-And then maybe,
-[whooing]

32:03.838 --> 32:06.674
maybe you won't feel so fucked up!

32:06.925 --> 32:08.009
[audience laughs]

32:08.176 --> 32:10.261
[uproarious cheers]

32:11.763 --> 32:13.181
Any questions?

32:14.933 --> 32:15.934
I'm here to teach.

32:16.142 --> 32:17.477
[audience laughs]

32:18.394 --> 32:19.437
Speaking of babies,

32:20.021 --> 32:21.439
I was at this party, right?

32:21.522 --> 32:25.318
I was at this party and it was popping.
And Drake's dad was there.

32:25.401 --> 32:27.612
-I don't know if y'all seen Drake's dad.
-[woman whoos]

32:27.737 --> 32:31.491
You know who Drake is, right? The rapper?
Well, his dad was at the party,

32:31.574 --> 32:32.408
so was Drake.

32:32.492 --> 32:34.953
But his dad was there.
And I don't know if you've ever seen him,

32:35.036 --> 32:37.956
but he looked like
the black Inspector Gadget.

32:38.081 --> 32:39.040
[laughing]

32:39.123 --> 32:40.291
Mixed with Super Fly.

32:40.458 --> 32:42.377
[whooing]

32:42.543 --> 32:43.795
And he was talking to me.

32:43.878 --> 32:46.547
He was like, "Tiffany,
you got a very bright career ahead of you.

32:46.631 --> 32:48.883
You plan on having any kids?
You plan on having any babies?

32:48.967 --> 32:51.803
I was like, "Ah, I don't know.
If God want me to,

32:51.886 --> 32:55.306
maybe in the next two or three years.
Maybe. Otherwise, I'll just adopt.

32:55.390 --> 32:57.141
Get some foster kids
or something like that."

32:57.225 --> 32:59.018
He said, "Well, you let me know.

32:59.435 --> 33:01.437
[laughing]

33:02.939 --> 33:03.982
Let me know.

33:05.274 --> 33:06.234
I make stars.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.820
You know, Drake is my son. Heh."

33:08.945 --> 33:10.029
[audience laughs]

33:10.488 --> 33:13.533
I said, "I know. Hold on one second,
Mister Gadget."

33:14.200 --> 33:15.618
[laughter]

33:16.452 --> 33:17.286
"Drake.

33:17.954 --> 33:18.788
Drake.

33:19.080 --> 33:22.959
-Drake, Drake! Drake! Drake."
-[laughing]

33:23.042 --> 33:25.586
He's like, "What, Tiff, what?"
-[clears throat] "Can I talk to you

33:25.670 --> 33:27.755
for a sec? Come here.
Let me talk to you for a second."

33:27.839 --> 33:30.299
He was like, "What? What's up?"
"Look here, Drake.

33:30.383 --> 33:34.387
[stammers] I would much rather be
your baby mama...

33:35.138 --> 33:36.222
than your step mama.

33:36.305 --> 33:37.932
-Get your daddy, nigga.
-[roaring laughter]

33:38.016 --> 33:39.100
Get your daddy!

33:39.225 --> 33:40.601
[whooing]

33:40.893 --> 33:41.728
Get him!"

33:42.145 --> 33:44.147
[cheering, clapping]

33:47.567 --> 33:49.485
You know what's crazy, is like--

33:50.194 --> 33:53.906
One of the things that I learned in life
is like how to survive, right?

33:53.990 --> 33:55.241
Like I'm a survivor.

33:55.324 --> 33:57.160
-[giggles] Mm. [laughs]
-[laughing]

33:59.370 --> 34:02.540
[chuckles] And when I was younger,

34:02.623 --> 34:06.461
it was so crazy 'cuz like I would hook up
with dudes 'cuz I was like so hungry.

34:06.544 --> 34:09.172
I weighed like a hundred pounds
and I was starving.

34:09.255 --> 34:12.675
And I would like, you know,
go out for dinner and lunch,

34:12.759 --> 34:14.427
-and breakfast, and...
-[audience laughs]

34:14.510 --> 34:16.054
[laughs] I was hungry.

34:16.387 --> 34:17.346
And...

34:17.847 --> 34:21.559
I'd be like, "Oh shoot, my cycle late.
Oh my God, what am I going to do?

34:21.641 --> 34:25.688
And then I would just go to Six Flags
and I would get on every roller coaster

34:25.772 --> 34:27.732
-[laughing]
-like six or seven times

34:27.815 --> 34:29.442
and I drink a fifth of Hennessy.

34:29.525 --> 34:30.443
-And...
-[laughter]

34:30.525 --> 34:31.860
Then my cycle would start.

34:31.944 --> 34:33.237
-That's how you do...
-[whooing]

34:34.155 --> 34:35.697
an abortion on a budget.

34:36.407 --> 34:38.326
[cackling]

34:39.744 --> 34:41.204
[clapping]

34:42.789 --> 34:45.083
-That was the late 1900s. [giggles]
-[continued laughter]

34:51.755 --> 34:52.965
[Haddish exhales slowly]

34:55.676 --> 34:56.552
Yup.

34:56.803 --> 34:59.013
But it's not even a joke. It's the truth.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.181
-That's when...
-[clapping]

35:00.264 --> 35:02.266
That's what you learn in foster care,
thinking like,

35:02.350 --> 35:03.726
"How am I gonna get rid of this!"

35:04.185 --> 35:06.020
I can't afford Planned Parenthood.

35:06.270 --> 35:07.605
[audience laughs]

35:08.022 --> 35:09.482
"You got Coca-Cola cans?"

35:09.565 --> 35:11.109
"Yeah. Six Flags."

35:11.526 --> 35:13.528
[roaring laughter]

35:14.237 --> 35:15.655
[clapping]

35:17.448 --> 35:19.450
[cackling]

35:22.078 --> 35:25.289
I don't think either one
of these companies is gonna sponsor me.

35:25.373 --> 35:27.708
[laughing, whooing]

35:31.379 --> 35:33.965
-But I ain't got no kid! [laughs]
-[audience laughs]

35:35.508 --> 35:36.843
[continued laughing]

35:37.885 --> 35:40.054
It's what happens when you raise yourself.

35:41.222 --> 35:44.684
It's the shit I learned, man.
It's the things I'm just here to teach.

35:44.767 --> 35:46.769
[laughing, clapping]

35:47.937 --> 35:49.564
[cheering]

35:50.648 --> 35:53.025
One of the valuable lessons
I learned in life

35:53.109 --> 35:55.361
that I think every woman should know is,
you know...

35:56.154 --> 36:00.116
Never let anybody with dirty hands
touch your cuckoo.

36:00.449 --> 36:01.784
[laughter]

36:02.034 --> 36:04.287
I learned this lesson
the hard way in life.

36:04.370 --> 36:06.831
I learned it the hard way.
I was about 17, right?

36:06.914 --> 36:08.666
I was on the school bus, alright?

36:08.749 --> 36:12.628
It was after the track practice,
and this boy I liked or whatever,

36:12.712 --> 36:14.797
and he is like, you know,
we was making out.

36:14.881 --> 36:18.259
He's like, "Can I touch your coochie?"
I was like, "Okay."

36:18.342 --> 36:19.844
[audience laughs]

36:19.969 --> 36:21.053
And I let him touch it.

36:21.971 --> 36:22.930
Next day,

36:23.556 --> 36:25.808
-I was itching like a motherfucker.
-[laughing]

36:25.933 --> 36:27.185
I was itching bad.

36:27.268 --> 36:30.605
I was like, "Oh, shit. Something's wrong."

36:30.855 --> 36:33.149
And I went to my homegirl and I was like,

36:34.525 --> 36:35.943
-[inhales] "Girl,
-[cackles]

36:36.152 --> 36:38.029
I think he gave me AIDS."

36:38.237 --> 36:39.530
[howling laughter]

36:39.697 --> 36:43.159
She was like, "What's wrong?"
I said, "My coochie itching really bad.

36:43.242 --> 36:44.493
I'm pretty sure it's AIDS."

36:44.577 --> 36:47.872
She was like, "No, Tiffany.
I heard my mom talking about this.

36:47.955 --> 36:49.665
You just need to put--
It's something white.

36:49.749 --> 36:52.543
-Yeah, mayonnaise. Put mayonnaise on.
-[screaming laughter]

36:52.627 --> 36:53.628
I was like, "What?"

36:53.711 --> 36:55.379
She was like,
"Yeah, put mayonnaise on it."

36:55.463 --> 36:58.507
So I went home.
I put mayonnaise on my cuckoo.

36:58.799 --> 37:01.844
[audience laughs]

37:03.137 --> 37:04.305
I went to sleep.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.265
When I woke up,

37:06.349 --> 37:09.268
-my left coochie lip was gone, y'all.
-[screaming laughter]

37:09.977 --> 37:12.605
-[clapping]
-My whole left lip was gone.

37:13.022 --> 37:15.983
My right lip was on super swole.
I was like, "Uh-oh.

37:17.443 --> 37:18.653
I'm growing a penis.

37:18.861 --> 37:20.571
[cackling]

37:21.239 --> 37:23.908
-I'm going through the change."
-[continued laughing]

37:24.116 --> 37:27.495
So I thought, "Or maybe... Okay,
maybe I'm not going through the change.

37:27.578 --> 37:28.704
Maybe it's just an infection.

37:28.788 --> 37:33.459
What Grandma say if you get an infection?
Oh yeah, put some peroxide on it."

37:33.542 --> 37:34.919
-[audience oohs]
-So...

37:35.586 --> 37:37.380
-[blowing hard into mic]
-[audience laughs]

37:39.548 --> 37:41.592
My coochie looked like it had rabies.

37:41.884 --> 37:43.219
[laughing]

37:43.844 --> 37:45.972
I was foaming. It was bad. [chuckles]

37:46.055 --> 37:47.306
[continued laughing]

37:47.515 --> 37:49.850
I went to her, she's like,
"Girl, you stupid."

37:49.934 --> 37:52.353
-[audience laughs]
-I was like, "Nobody raised me, bitch!

37:52.436 --> 37:54.105
I'm just going off things

37:54.188 --> 37:56.148
-that I hear from other people!
-[laughing]

37:56.274 --> 37:58.442
This is why I'm glad
there's the Internet now.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.987
This was the 1900s.
The bitch didn't know no better.

38:01.153 --> 38:02.363
[laughing, clapping]

38:05.658 --> 38:08.995
-[continued laughing]
-[Haddish snickering]

38:10.621 --> 38:11.914
It was so bad.

38:12.623 --> 38:15.793
I went back to sleep.
I went to bed to sleep. When I woke up,

38:15.876 --> 38:19.255
my right coochie lip looked like
it was a hot dog

38:19.338 --> 38:21.674
-in the microwave for too long.
-[audience laughs]

38:22.133 --> 38:23.884
[screaming laughter]

38:29.056 --> 38:30.725
We're not gonna show that image.

38:31.017 --> 38:33.144
[roaring laughter]

38:33.394 --> 38:34.687
[clapping]

38:35.146 --> 38:36.439
[whoos]

38:36.939 --> 38:39.900
Turns out I just had a yeast infection
on steroids.

38:40.401 --> 38:42.403
So what did we learn from this?

38:43.529 --> 38:45.239
Dirty nails, dirty D.

38:46.532 --> 38:48.993
-That motherfucker can't touch me.
-[laughing]

38:49.076 --> 38:50.661
-And...
-[clapping]

38:51.329 --> 38:53.205
Don't put mayonnaise on your pussy.
[chuckles]

38:53.372 --> 38:54.999
[audience laughs]

38:56.042 --> 38:58.044
[clapping, cheering]

39:00.629 --> 39:01.756
You know,

39:01.839 --> 39:05.384
when I was homeless in the city
full of my family members, right?

39:05.676 --> 39:09.638
And this is the thing, like,
now that I'm successful,

39:09.722 --> 39:12.808
family members feel like they could just
ask me for money.

39:13.726 --> 39:16.020
Just ask me, just like, like I owe them.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.189
Like, wait, hold up, bitch.

39:18.689 --> 39:20.691
[laughing]

39:21.776 --> 39:24.487
When I was sleeping in my Geo Metro
two-door hatchback

39:24.570 --> 39:25.821
and it was middle of winter,

39:25.905 --> 39:27.156
and I asked if I could come over

39:27.239 --> 39:29.408
and sleep on your couch
and you told me no.

39:29.617 --> 39:30.868
[shouts of affirmation]

39:31.118 --> 39:32.161
Why do you think

39:32.661 --> 39:35.039
-I'mma give you a dime?
-[audience laughs]

39:35.122 --> 39:38.292
"Because blood is thicker than the cold."
No, it ain't, bitch!

39:38.376 --> 39:41.003
-[gruff] I'm still cold in my heart.
-[laughing]

39:41.212 --> 39:42.463
I ain't forgot!

39:42.546 --> 39:44.548
[cheering]

39:45.841 --> 39:47.134
I ain't forgot!

39:50.513 --> 39:53.599
Wait till I get Alzheimer's
and then ask me for some shit.

39:53.849 --> 39:56.644
-[audience laughs]
-[Haddish giggles]

39:57.436 --> 39:58.521
That's how I feel.

39:59.647 --> 40:01.273
'Cuz I work my ass off.

40:01.357 --> 40:04.527
-I work really, really, really hard.
-[woman whoos]

40:04.610 --> 40:05.444
And I work so hard

40:05.528 --> 40:07.863
because I want to bless
the ones that did look out for me.

40:07.947 --> 40:09.740
Like my granny, she looked out.

40:09.865 --> 40:13.035
So now she needs a little help,
I got her staying in my house.

40:13.119 --> 40:14.787
And you know, [chuckles]

40:15.037 --> 40:18.541
I love her to death,
but she is a major cock-blocker.

40:18.624 --> 40:20.751
-I can't even have sex in my house.
-[audience laughs]

40:21.001 --> 40:24.422
She's a super cock-blocker.
I didn't block no cock from her. But...

40:24.547 --> 40:25.923
-[laughing]
-Nam sayin'?

40:26.048 --> 40:27.675
She had five kids, four baby daddies.

40:27.758 --> 40:30.177
-Ain't nobody stop her.
-[roaring laughter]

40:32.513 --> 40:33.639
[continued laughing]

40:34.056 --> 40:37.059
Let me bring a man in the house,
she hear a man, she in there clappin'

40:37.143 --> 40:39.186
like it's church Sunday or somethin'.
She-- [laughs]

40:39.353 --> 40:42.523
And then we talking like,
"Yeah, so, ah, so, ah,

40:43.023 --> 40:46.110
you... you wanna make out?
He's like, "Oh yeah."

40:46.193 --> 40:47.403
Starting touch on my waist.

40:47.486 --> 40:48.946
And then you hear my grandma:

40:49.071 --> 40:50.906
-[popping claps]
-[audience laughs]

40:51.031 --> 40:52.741
[yelling] "What y'all doing up in there?

40:53.159 --> 40:55.161
Bring me in. Let me look at it!"

40:55.703 --> 40:57.705
[laughing, clapping]

40:58.873 --> 41:01.083
[stammering]
"You, you live-- You live with somebody?"

41:02.334 --> 41:03.711
"She live with me."

41:03.919 --> 41:04.795
[audience laughs]

41:05.546 --> 41:06.839
[cackling]

41:09.717 --> 41:10.759
Always blocking!

41:11.343 --> 41:13.596
That's why I ain't had no dick
all last year.

41:14.096 --> 41:15.723
-[laughter]
-[Haddish snickering]

41:18.142 --> 41:18.976
It's all good.

41:19.059 --> 41:20.311
I'm fixing up her house.

41:20.686 --> 41:24.148
I'm actually trying to buy her a house
just so I can put her in there

41:24.231 --> 41:25.608
so I can get some dick in mine.

41:25.691 --> 41:27.067
[audience laughs]

41:27.610 --> 41:28.944
[clapping, whooing]

41:32.948 --> 41:34.575
I'm dead fucking serious. [giggles]

41:34.992 --> 41:36.076
It's not a joke.

41:36.243 --> 41:37.244
[laughter]

41:37.912 --> 41:38.871
[Haddish chuckles]

41:39.830 --> 41:42.124
A lot of my--
Since I've been getting popular, you know,

41:42.208 --> 41:44.001
a lot of my exes have been popping up.

41:44.084 --> 41:48.088
A lot of my exes have been popping up
and what I have realized is that like

41:48.172 --> 41:52.468
I don't know
what it is about my vagina, but... [sighs]

41:53.344 --> 41:55.804
These dudes,
they don't want to get they life straight.

41:55.888 --> 41:58.891
They don't get they life together,
but they all get braces.

41:59.058 --> 42:00.142
[howling laughter]

42:01.352 --> 42:03.771
And I'm trying to figure out
what is it about my pussy

42:03.854 --> 42:07.900
that make you decide once we break up,
"I'mma get my teeth together."

42:08.150 --> 42:09.401
[laughing]

42:14.198 --> 42:18.285
It's always the dudes I think got money
but they don't got no damn money.

42:18.452 --> 42:19.745
[audience laughs]

42:19.995 --> 42:23.040
And I'm not -- I figured out
what my favorite kind of man is.

42:23.123 --> 42:26.752
It used to be like a fit man
with abs and stuff, you know,

42:26.835 --> 42:30.047
like I used to love that
but I realized they are fucking broke.

42:30.256 --> 42:31.423
[laughing]

42:32.591 --> 42:35.010
-That's why they got abs.
-[audience laughs]

42:35.427 --> 42:37.179
They hungry just like I was.

42:37.471 --> 42:38.931
[laughter]

42:41.016 --> 42:44.144
And it's hard to fuck a skinny dude.
Like I love to ride.

42:44.228 --> 42:46.146
I'mma rider! I'mma rider! [laughs]

42:46.480 --> 42:48.649
[cackling]

42:49.483 --> 42:50.609
[clapping]

42:50.859 --> 42:52.778
Sometimes you be riding on a skinny guy,

42:52.861 --> 42:55.155
he got a flat-ass belly and shit.

42:55.447 --> 42:58.325
Them bones. Them bones be rubbing up
against your thighs,

42:58.409 --> 43:01.161
make it look like you've been
pole dancing all night and shit.

43:01.245 --> 43:02.371
[cackling]

43:03.330 --> 43:06.875
All bruised up in this motherfucker
'cause he's so god damn skinny.

43:08.669 --> 43:09.545
[Haddish giggles]

43:10.129 --> 43:12.756
I like how some woman
in the back was like, "Shit!"

43:12.881 --> 43:13.924
[laughter]

43:14.049 --> 43:16.427
'Cuz she just fucked
a skinny dude yesterday.

43:16.510 --> 43:19.096
-[audience laughs]
-This bullshit here.

43:20.097 --> 43:21.390
That shit be hurting!

43:22.725 --> 43:23.976
But they do have D, though.

43:25.644 --> 43:28.897
And you trying to ride.
You're like, "I'mma sit on this..."

43:29.023 --> 43:31.567
-[laughter]
-You be tryin' to ride you like, "Yeah."

43:31.650 --> 43:33.736
But they so fucking skinny,

43:34.028 --> 43:35.571
they ain't got nothing to stop you

43:35.696 --> 43:37.448
-from sliding up to the front
-[laughing]

43:37.865 --> 43:40.284
and busting him in the mouth, like,
"Well, there you go.

43:41.327 --> 43:43.162
Go on and eat that.
That's for you right there.

43:43.245 --> 43:44.204
That's fast food.

43:44.580 --> 43:46.915
I'm up here at your mouth already,
might as well open up."

43:46.999 --> 43:49.001
-Ah...
-[roaring laughter]

43:50.919 --> 43:53.756
That's why I prefer
like a more heavyset dude.

43:53.839 --> 43:55.299
Like a dude with a little gut on 'em.

43:56.133 --> 43:58.052
That's what I prefer, a little belly.

43:58.844 --> 44:01.180
-Little... [blows raspberry]
-[audience laughs]

44:02.723 --> 44:04.767
Look like he got a lot of parasites.

44:04.975 --> 44:06.435
[laughing]

44:06.810 --> 44:07.978
Bloated like you, sir.

44:08.562 --> 44:10.564
[whooing]

44:11.774 --> 44:13.609
First off, I know you can cook.

44:13.692 --> 44:16.153
-[audience laughs]
-I know I ain't gonna be hungry.

44:17.738 --> 44:19.657
[chuckles]
And you got that little belly on you.

44:19.990 --> 44:21.533
-Mm...
-[laughter]

44:22.368 --> 44:23.911
That's that coochie bumper.

44:24.620 --> 44:26.372
That keep you from falling off.

44:26.497 --> 44:27.706
[laughing]

44:28.415 --> 44:30.834
Get on that. You can lay down.
He lay down like that.

44:30.918 --> 44:32.211
He put that mofuka up.

44:32.294 --> 44:34.046
-[Haddish exhales]
-[laughter]

44:34.380 --> 44:37.049
"There you go your dick,
there it go. Okay.

44:37.424 --> 44:39.426
-[Haddish laughs]
-[audience laughs]

44:41.387 --> 44:44.139
[soft voice]
Okay, there it go. I'm feeling now.

44:44.640 --> 44:46.225
Hey dick....

44:46.350 --> 44:47.351
[audience laughs]

44:47.685 --> 44:51.438
-You ready to disappear in this pussy?"
-[laughing]

44:51.897 --> 44:53.982
He's like, "Stop playing
and get on that mofuka."

44:54.066 --> 44:54.900
"Alright."

44:55.025 --> 44:56.360
[laughter]

44:56.944 --> 45:00.322
You climb up on that shit
like you on a ride at Six Flags.

45:00.447 --> 45:01.365
"Okay."

45:01.448 --> 45:02.574
[laughing]

45:02.950 --> 45:04.243
You lock in right there.

45:04.326 --> 45:05.786
He let that belly down. Pop!

45:05.869 --> 45:08.205
-That land on your thighs.
-[howling laughter]

45:08.956 --> 45:12.042
Now you can't move, bitch.
All you can do is this. Right here.

45:13.001 --> 45:15.003
That's it. 'Cuz that belly hold you down.

45:15.170 --> 45:17.172
[screaming laughter]

45:18.549 --> 45:20.926
[cackling, clapping]

45:22.469 --> 45:24.722
-"Ooh..." [laughs]
-[audience laughs]

45:25.222 --> 45:28.434
-You riding on that dick like, "Whee!
-[laughing]

45:28.851 --> 45:30.561
Now come on, suck on my titties."

45:30.644 --> 45:33.021
He's like, "Whoever titty's the biggest
gets sucked on first."

45:33.105 --> 45:34.148
Like, "Shit!"

45:34.356 --> 45:35.941
[audience laughs]

45:36.400 --> 45:39.278
-[whooping]
-[Haddish puckering]

45:43.741 --> 45:46.577
When you really take the time
to really look at a penis,

45:47.244 --> 45:49.246
it's nothing but a vagina that fell out.

45:49.413 --> 45:51.123
[laughter]

45:52.958 --> 45:54.334
[continued laughter]

45:54.418 --> 45:56.420
I mean, if you really look at it,
you can tell.

45:57.254 --> 46:00.507
Like... The testicles are the ovaries.

46:01.300 --> 46:03.010
The sack is the uterus.

46:03.635 --> 46:06.346
The shaft is the vaginal canal.

46:06.722 --> 46:08.348
And the tip is a clitoris.

46:08.432 --> 46:09.433
Your pussy fell out.

46:09.516 --> 46:12.686
[cackling, cheering]

46:13.771 --> 46:15.355
[clapping]

46:16.398 --> 46:20.277
Scientific proven fact. It's a fact.
Every single one of us humans,

46:20.360 --> 46:22.029
we start out as female.

46:22.112 --> 46:24.281
The first three months,
you start out as female.

46:24.364 --> 46:25.866
Then the chromosome kicks in.

46:27.034 --> 46:28.744
That's why God felt bad for y'all, men.

46:28.827 --> 46:31.830
God felt bad and gave you
strong arms and strong legs.

46:31.914 --> 46:32.748
[laughter]

46:32.915 --> 46:35.667
So you can hold on to things
'cuz you couldn't hold onto your pussy.

46:35.751 --> 46:38.378
-So.
-[howling laughter]

46:40.339 --> 46:41.256
He felt bad.

46:41.548 --> 46:42.883
[continued laughter]

46:43.842 --> 46:45.844
[whooping, clapping]

46:49.640 --> 46:51.016
[Haddish snickering]

46:52.142 --> 46:56.855
[sighs] My favorite part is to watch a man
sleeping with no clothes on

46:57.189 --> 46:59.024
and just to look at his balls.

46:59.358 --> 47:00.609
[audience laughs]

47:01.443 --> 47:04.071
Balls never ever stop moving.

47:04.154 --> 47:07.991
-Balls are always in motion.
-[laughing]

47:08.909 --> 47:10.077
They never stop moving.

47:10.160 --> 47:12.746
That's how-- If I'm like,
"Oh, is he dead?"

47:12.830 --> 47:16.166
I just look at his balls.
I don't even check to see if he breathing.

47:16.291 --> 47:18.043
[cackling]

47:18.961 --> 47:20.045
Balls be like this...

47:20.671 --> 47:22.673
[roaring laughter]

47:25.133 --> 47:26.635
[whooing]

47:29.847 --> 47:31.849
[continued laughter]

47:32.140 --> 47:34.142
When you get close to them,
if you get close,

47:34.226 --> 47:36.311
all the wrinkles come out.
They'll be like, "Hi."

47:36.478 --> 47:37.729
[audience laughs]

47:38.272 --> 47:39.565
[clapping]

47:40.107 --> 47:42.818
If you move back, they'll be like,
"Why did you leave?"

47:44.319 --> 47:46.989
-Looking like elephant knees and shit.
-[laughter]

47:48.574 --> 47:51.243
That's just some of the things
I've learned in life.

47:51.493 --> 47:52.703
[laughing]

47:52.953 --> 47:53.829
Knowledge.

47:54.621 --> 47:55.956
[laughs]

47:56.707 --> 48:00.002
It's so stupid, but I feel like, later on,

48:00.335 --> 48:03.005
like in the next month or so,
y'all gonna reflect back on that,

48:03.088 --> 48:05.132
like, "That was really good knowledge."

48:05.257 --> 48:06.550
[audience laughs]

48:06.675 --> 48:09.761
-[clapping]
-That-- that is helpful.

48:10.596 --> 48:11.889
[cheering]

48:14.224 --> 48:16.101
Are you praying for me, sir? [chuckles]

48:17.144 --> 48:19.771
-He's like, [gruff] "Oh, shit."
-[laughter]

48:21.899 --> 48:24.318
-[Haddish laughs]
-[audience laughing]

48:24.735 --> 48:27.154
You know religion is something that,
to me,

48:27.279 --> 48:30.490
I'm always trying
to figure it out religion, right?

48:30.574 --> 48:32.200
Like, I've tried them all.

48:32.326 --> 48:35.203
I literally have tried
all the religions, okay?

48:35.329 --> 48:38.165
I tried Scientology and I realize
I can't fuck with that.

48:38.248 --> 48:40.250
They got bunk beds.
I don't do bunk beds.

48:40.334 --> 48:41.335
[audience laughs]

48:41.543 --> 48:44.630
Catholicism, I tried that.
But they get up and down too much.

48:44.713 --> 48:46.048
And then the wine ain't real.

48:46.131 --> 48:49.384
They givin' you grape juice and shit
in like fake-ass paper crackers.

48:49.468 --> 48:51.929
-Where the fuck is the seasoning?
-[laughter]

48:53.513 --> 48:56.183
Jehovah Witness.
I like Jehovah Witnesses

48:56.266 --> 48:59.436
because for your--
Like, first off, you get exercise

48:59.519 --> 49:01.647
'cuz you walking around
from door to door, right?

49:01.730 --> 49:04.566
And they give you
the best butterscotch candies ever.

49:04.816 --> 49:06.944
-[audience laughs]
-[Haddish chuckles]

49:08.862 --> 49:10.405
Some people know what I'm talking about,

49:10.489 --> 49:12.157
some people are like,
"They give out candy?"

49:12.240 --> 49:14.076
-[audience laughs]
-For every Watchtower

49:14.159 --> 49:15.535
you get a butterscotch.

49:15.953 --> 49:18.288
[laughter]

49:19.665 --> 49:21.041
That's when I was a kid.

49:22.292 --> 49:26.213
And through all of that, [stammering]
I realized like, Judaism, I love it,

49:26.296 --> 49:28.256
but you have to know Hebrew.
You have to know this.

49:28.340 --> 49:30.550
You gotta be a certain way.
You gotta do all these things.

49:30.634 --> 49:33.053
And I've been to like
over 500 bar mitzvahs.

49:33.136 --> 49:35.263
And I'm tired of people
telling me to go to the kitchen.

49:35.347 --> 49:37.265
"No, motherfucker,
I'm supposed to be here."

49:37.349 --> 49:39.434
-[howling laughter]
-[exasperated exhale]

49:41.853 --> 49:44.481
So now I'm just, I'm spiritual.

49:44.564 --> 49:46.108
I'm very spiritual, okay?

49:46.191 --> 49:47.609
-I'm a spiritual person.
-[cheering]

49:48.777 --> 49:50.779
[clapping]

49:55.158 --> 49:58.161
But there's something
that's really been bothering me a lot.

49:58.620 --> 50:01.665
And I don't know if y'all noticed this,
but have y'all seen

50:01.915 --> 50:03.792
these billboards all over the cities?

50:03.875 --> 50:06.795
Like no matter what city I go to,
no matter where I'm at,

50:07.254 --> 50:09.464
I see billboards for the Shenyun.

50:09.965 --> 50:11.967
[audience laughs]

50:12.217 --> 50:15.929
The Shenyun.
Has anybody ever been to this Shen--

50:16.013 --> 50:19.766
Is this a religion or a cult?
What the fuck is a Shenyun?

50:20.183 --> 50:21.518
[laughter]

50:21.685 --> 50:23.770
Has anybody ever seen this?
Has anybody?

50:23.854 --> 50:26.523
Oh, you been?
I went to look them up on YouTube

50:26.606 --> 50:28.358
to see like what do they do
at the Shenyun.

50:28.442 --> 50:30.318
Maybe they got a video
or a little advertisement.

50:30.402 --> 50:33.447
And I was like watching. And I was like,
"Oh, they just dance? That's it?

50:33.530 --> 50:34.489
They just dance?

50:34.573 --> 50:37.117
I could be in the Shenyun."
Now, I would love to be the first...

50:37.200 --> 50:41.121
'Cuz like every black person wants to be
the first black person to do something.

50:41.246 --> 50:42.831
-[laughter]
-So I want to be the first

50:42.914 --> 50:47.002
African-American Jew
to be in a Shenyun performance.

50:47.419 --> 50:48.628
[audience laughs]

50:49.421 --> 50:51.423
[roaring laughter]

50:51.673 --> 50:52.841
[clapping]

50:54.676 --> 50:56.094
That's one that's on Crenshaw.

50:56.178 --> 50:57.804
-That's on Crenshaw.
-[continued laughter]

50:57.888 --> 51:00.849
You can see that billboard
on Crenshaw and 48th. [giggles]

51:00.932 --> 51:01.808
[laughing]

51:02.517 --> 51:03.810
That's me in the Shenyun.

51:03.894 --> 51:05.771
It's crazy, speaking of dancing,

51:05.854 --> 51:08.982
like, I've always wanted to be like
a professional dancer.

51:09.316 --> 51:12.110
And when I was younger,
a bunch of my friends,

51:12.194 --> 51:15.363
they started like dancing
in the strip club, right?

51:15.447 --> 51:18.950
And this is when we was kind of poor,
and I was like a hundred pounds.

51:19.034 --> 51:20.911
And I was like, "Oh, man,
they was making money."

51:20.994 --> 51:23.580
I thought maybe I can get in there
and get on the pole.

51:23.663 --> 51:25.082
I could dance, right?

51:25.165 --> 51:28.460
-[audience laughs]
-So it's like... I said, "I'mma audition.

51:28.543 --> 51:31.588
I'mma audition for, you know,
be a stripper." [laughs]

51:31.713 --> 51:32.672
[laughter]

51:32.756 --> 51:34.424
And I went in that audition, I was like...

51:34.508 --> 51:35.675
[humming tune]

51:36.593 --> 51:38.512
[howling laughter]

51:41.848 --> 51:43.183
[clapping]

51:44.726 --> 51:46.937
They was like,
"Get your ass off the stage." [laughs]

51:47.437 --> 51:52.025
Apparently pop-lockin' and moonwalking
is not stripper dancing.

51:52.150 --> 51:53.068
[laughter]

51:53.151 --> 51:54.986
And then I was like,
"Can I be a waitress?"

51:55.112 --> 51:57.489
They was like, "Hell no.
You probably gonna steal the food."

51:57.572 --> 51:59.199
-And they was right.
-[audience laughs]

52:00.158 --> 52:02.244
So then I would just hang out
with my homegirls

52:02.327 --> 52:04.037
and pick up they money
for them or whatever

52:04.121 --> 52:05.455
and just like be there with them.

52:05.539 --> 52:07.207
And as I was there,

52:07.290 --> 52:10.460
I started to realize like
the laziest strippers

52:10.544 --> 52:13.213
