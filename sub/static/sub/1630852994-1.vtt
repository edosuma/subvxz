00:14.764 --> 00:16.558
I'm Jimmy DiResta, and I'm a maker.

00:16.641 --> 00:19.352
That's a hip way of saying
I make things… like this.

00:19.436 --> 00:20.562
Pretty cool, right?

00:21.312 --> 00:22.522
Walk with me.

00:22.605 --> 00:25.608
For years, I made my name
as a toy designer in New York City.

00:25.692 --> 00:29.487
Then I realized I don't like the city,
I don't like designing toys,

00:29.571 --> 00:32.240
and to be honest with you,
I don't really like kids.

00:32.323 --> 00:33.992
It's not like I hate them or anything.

00:34.075 --> 00:36.536
It's just it's,
"Check out my little Timmy."

00:36.619 --> 00:37.787
I don't care.

00:37.871 --> 00:38.830
Look at my birds.

00:40.832 --> 00:42.584
So anyway, I quit my job,

00:42.667 --> 00:46.087
I left the city,
and I moved upstate to here, my farm.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.673
I got land, I got animals,

00:49.340 --> 00:51.217
and best of all, I have this!

00:51.718 --> 00:53.678
The ultimate maker workshop!

00:54.471 --> 00:58.892
Inside, I have every kind of tool
and machine imaginable to make things.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.853
Pretty impressive stuff, huh?

01:02.854 --> 01:06.232
Really? You're labeling the table
like that's some sort of impress--

01:06.316 --> 01:07.817
"Bag"? We can just--

01:07.901 --> 01:10.278
Okay. Graphics guy trying to be funny.

01:10.361 --> 01:12.781
Can we please get on with it? Anyway…

01:12.864 --> 01:15.867
So I got a call to be on a TV show
'cause I'm a maker celebrity or whatever.

01:15.950 --> 01:18.161
I said, "Sure. Cool." Why not, right?

01:18.244 --> 01:19.204
So I agreed.

01:19.954 --> 01:21.956
Then I found out who I'd be working for.

01:22.040 --> 01:22.957
<i>Jimmy!</i>

01:23.041 --> 01:24.375
<i>-Hi.</i>
<i>-Hi!</i>

01:24.459 --> 01:25.376
<i>Jimmy!</i>

01:25.460 --> 01:26.294
<i>Hey, Jimmy.</i>

01:26.377 --> 01:27.504
What do you want?

01:27.587 --> 01:29.380
<i>Okay, Mr. Grouch.</i>

01:30.590 --> 01:35.053
Thirty years of expert build experience,
and I'm taking orders from half-pints.

01:35.136 --> 01:38.556
Because misery loves company,
I brought my buddies in on it with me.

01:38.640 --> 01:39.474
Say hi, guys.

01:39.557 --> 01:40.391
-Howdy!
-Hello!

01:40.475 --> 01:43.478
That's Jackman.
He's an engineer, and he plans everything.

01:43.561 --> 01:45.688
It's really annoying, but he's good at it.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.232
That's Derek, my best friend.

01:47.315 --> 01:50.443
Big guy and even bigger softie.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.403
This is Graz.

01:52.487 --> 01:53.988
Good maker, bad jokes.

01:54.489 --> 01:55.782
And Canadian Pat.

01:56.741 --> 01:59.369
Well, your guess is as good as mine.

01:59.452 --> 02:00.453
Let's have some fun.

02:04.624 --> 02:06.501
Together, we'll take pitches on this.

02:06.584 --> 02:09.170
Listen to whatever
their dumb little brains can come up with.

02:09.254 --> 02:11.422
<i>The Pig Tripper. It trips the pig.</i>

02:11.506 --> 02:14.175
-Wow.
-So a catapult that throws cat poop?

02:14.259 --> 02:16.052
<i>-Yes.</i>

02:16.136 --> 02:19.222
If it's interesting or doable,
I'll build it. If not--

02:19.305 --> 02:20.265
Next!

02:20.348 --> 02:21.516
-Next!
<i>-No way.</i>

02:21.599 --> 02:22.976
-Next!
<i>-Shut up!</i>

02:23.059 --> 02:24.936
-Some builds will be good.

02:25.019 --> 02:26.855
Dino Taco Toilet.

02:26.938 --> 02:28.439
Are you not entertained?

02:28.523 --> 02:30.108
Some builds will be bad.

02:30.191 --> 02:32.443
Graz, I told you
the scissors were gonna be too heavy!

02:32.527 --> 02:33.570
Make a bigger handle!

02:33.653 --> 02:35.697
But all of them
will be absolutely pointless.

02:35.780 --> 02:37.907
-Yeah!
-That is disgusting.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.827
Whoa!

02:41.411 --> 02:44.622
<i>-I want the unicorn to fart!</i>
-I can't believe I'm doing this.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.791
-Go, Graz!

02:46.875 --> 02:49.878
Why are we doing this?
Because we make things. That's what we do.

02:49.961 --> 02:52.922
-Thought we weren't supposed to have fun.
-I'm not having fun!

02:53.715 --> 02:55.717
We're gonna show these kids,
if they can dream it up…

02:55.800 --> 02:58.803
<i>I want it to be a guitar boat that floats.</i>

02:58.887 --> 03:00.013
You're onto something there.

03:00.096 --> 03:01.681
…it can be built.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.017
<i>Oh!</i>

03:04.100 --> 03:05.685
<i>That is so cool!</i>

03:05.768 --> 03:07.687
Hey, it might even
inspire them to build

03:07.770 --> 03:09.898
outside their little <i>Minecraft</i> -y world,
or whatever.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.816
-Do I wanna do it?

03:11.900 --> 03:13.401
Dumbest thing we've ever made.

03:13.484 --> 03:16.571
Not really.
But this isn't about me, is it?

03:16.654 --> 03:18.781
-So here we are.
<i>-You better get to work!</i>

03:18.865 --> 03:20.867
Funny how their dreams are my nightmare.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.162
Come on, Jimmy. Have some fun.

03:24.245 --> 03:25.079
Whatever.

03:40.094 --> 03:43.181
All right. In a minute, there's gonna be
a couple children on-screen.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.432
They're gonna pitch us ideas.

03:44.515 --> 03:46.976
We're gonna decide which one
is gonna be the one that we make.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.770
We're gonna have everything
at our disposal

03:48.853 --> 03:51.147
to make whatever dumb idea
these kids come up with.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.982
And, uh, here we are.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.317
A real motivator.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.069
-All right, come on, guys!

03:56.819 --> 03:58.488
-Hey! What's your name?
<i>-My name's Adrian.</i>

03:58.571 --> 03:59.864
<i>And my name is Christian.</i>

03:59.948 --> 04:01.950
Have you guys ever invented stuff before?

04:02.033 --> 04:03.076
<i>Um…</i>

04:03.159 --> 04:04.244
<i>-Well…</i>
-That's a no.

04:04.827 --> 04:06.871
-What's your name, buddy?
<i>-Grant.</i>

04:06.955 --> 04:08.456
-Tell me your names.
<i>-William.</i>

04:08.539 --> 04:10.250
<i>Jasmine and James.</i>

04:10.333 --> 04:11.626
Jasmine and James.

04:11.709 --> 04:13.002
<i>-Yeah.</i>
-Where are you?

04:13.086 --> 04:15.088
-Where are you in the world?
<i>-In our house.</i>

04:16.005 --> 04:19.050
-What city?
<i>-Not your beeswax!</i>

04:19.133 --> 04:20.885
-Stranger danger.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.637
Okay, what's your idea?

04:22.720 --> 04:26.224
<i>There's gonna be</i>
<i>a bunch of goats in my garage,</i>

04:26.307 --> 04:31.271
<i>and a roller coaster weaving</i>
<i>from my roof into my backyard.</i>

04:31.354 --> 04:33.773
Are you trying to get
two ideas for the price of one?

04:33.856 --> 04:36.859
<i>-Yes. I want goats and a rollercoaster.</i>

04:37.360 --> 04:40.071
-Pitch me.
-<i>The Fart Humidifier.</i>

04:40.154 --> 04:41.990
-What?
-That was my nickname in high school.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.867
<i>The Fart Humidifier sucks up your fart,</i>

04:44.951 --> 04:47.787
<i>and then puts it in a bottle</i>
<i>to spray at anybody.</i>

04:47.870 --> 04:50.873
Now, why would I want
to put a fart in a bottle and spray it?

04:50.957 --> 04:52.292
<i>Sweet vengeance.</i>

04:54.460 --> 04:57.547
<i>This is a suit that can go to outer space,</i>

04:57.630 --> 05:00.925
<i>and it's faster than light speed.</i>

05:01.009 --> 05:03.094
-That's easy enough.
-That's great, what else?

05:03.177 --> 05:06.431
<i>This is a door</i>
<i>that leads to outer space.</i>

05:06.514 --> 05:07.765
Okay!

05:07.849 --> 05:08.933
<i>The next idea.</i>

05:09.017 --> 05:10.893
You guys have an invention for me?

05:12.854 --> 05:14.689
Now is the pitch time.

05:14.772 --> 05:16.316
-Now.
-Be nice to them.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.942
-They're nice kids.
-Pitch me!

05:18.026 --> 05:22.572
<i>My idea is a model of every superhero</i>

05:22.655 --> 05:25.533
<i>spray-painted in the exact color,</i>

05:25.616 --> 05:30.038
<i>and it has the same special effects</i>
<i>as the superheroes' powers.</i>

05:30.538 --> 05:33.124
That's interesting.
You ever hear of Toys "R" Us?

05:34.334 --> 05:35.168
<i>What now?</i>

05:35.668 --> 05:37.545
They've gone out of business, Jimmy.

05:37.628 --> 05:39.756
<i>-Now it's time for the demonstration.</i>

05:39.839 --> 05:41.716
Make sure it's just air, brother.

05:46.929 --> 05:49.390
I'll give you $30,000
for 25% of your company.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.643
-<i>No! Stop!</i>
-I'm out.

05:52.727 --> 05:54.729
-I think that might be…
<i>-Yeah.</i>

05:54.812 --> 05:58.024
-…the dumbest idea we've heard today.
<i>-Okay, Boomer.</i>

05:59.567 --> 06:02.695
<i>Have you ever just hated</i>
<i>when people gave you a Dutch Oven?</i>

06:02.779 --> 06:03.738
Next!

06:03.821 --> 06:05.907
<i>-I got more! I got more! I got more!</i>
-Next.

06:05.990 --> 06:07.909
<i>-No way.</i>
<i>-Can you build me a time machine?</i>

06:07.992 --> 06:09.744
-Next!
<i>-Oh no…</i>

06:09.827 --> 06:12.246
-All right. Don't call us, we'll call you.
-<i>Okay.</i>

06:12.330 --> 06:14.290
<i>I'll just go down in my basement.</i>

06:15.666 --> 06:17.251
-Next!

06:18.795 --> 06:21.339
I think we take all the money
from the budget of this show

06:21.422 --> 06:24.092
and donate it to the school system
over there. What do you think?

06:25.927 --> 06:27.887
-He's a nice boy.
-All right.

06:28.513 --> 06:29.931
-What's your names?
<i>-Asher.</i>

06:30.014 --> 06:31.766
<i>-Farah.</i>
-Where do you guys live?

06:31.849 --> 06:34.477
<i>We live in the USA.</i>

06:34.560 --> 06:37.021
-All right. Who's the smarter one?

06:37.105 --> 06:38.731
<i>Of course, it's the girl.</i>

06:38.815 --> 06:41.275
Of course. I… I kind of was sensing that.

06:41.359 --> 06:42.610
<i>Who's the dumbest?</i>

06:45.071 --> 06:46.447
At least he knows his place.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.157
You have an idea to pitch us?

06:48.241 --> 06:51.077
<i>It's gonna be a T. rex</i>

06:51.160 --> 06:53.704
<i>that shoots out tacos.</i>

06:54.205 --> 06:56.499
A T. rex, as in a T. rex dinosaur?

06:56.582 --> 06:57.750
<i>-Yeah!</i>
<i>-Yes!</i>

06:57.834 --> 07:00.211
Jimmy, find out
where it shoots tacos from.

07:00.294 --> 07:01.129
Tell me more.

07:01.212 --> 07:03.464
<i>Actually,</i>
<i>they're not gonna be regular tacos.</i>

07:03.548 --> 07:07.510
<i>They're gonna have candy.</i>
<i>They're gonna be called the candy tacos.</i>

07:07.593 --> 07:08.970
-Candy taco.
-Interesting.

07:09.053 --> 07:11.597
<i>And some of the tacos</i>
<i>are gonna be real tacos.</i>

07:14.725 --> 07:16.686
<i>He loves tacos.</i>

07:16.769 --> 07:19.522
Are you talking about yourself
in the third person, like Don King?

07:20.898 --> 07:25.069
So you said a T. rex dinosaur?
Why not a Stegosaurus or "mega-sore-ass"?

07:25.153 --> 07:28.197
<i>T. rex because it's the biggest dinosaur,</i>

07:28.281 --> 07:31.868
<i>so it can hold more and more tacos</i>
<i>than any other dinosaur.</i>

07:31.951 --> 07:33.619
It shoots tacos out of which end?

07:34.829 --> 07:37.665
<i>His mouth and his nose!</i>

07:37.748 --> 07:40.126
-His mouth and his nose.
-Phew.

07:40.209 --> 07:43.546
Um, okay, I'm buying it.
I think you're onto something there.

07:43.629 --> 07:46.716
<i>-It has little, tiny arms.</i>
-He's got little, tiny arms, like Graz.

07:46.799 --> 07:49.010
<i>Tiny ones. Like, this tiny.</i>

07:50.887 --> 07:54.098
I'm warming up to this idea.
And how big do you see it? How tall?

07:54.182 --> 07:56.350
-<i>Fourteen-feet tall.</i>
-Fourteen feet.

07:56.434 --> 07:59.812
But the doors here are only 12,
so we might have to go lower than that.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.647
<i>Twelve-feet tall!</i>

08:03.483 --> 08:04.901
That's a pretty easy client.

08:04.984 --> 08:07.111
Chill for a minute.
Let me talk to my team.

08:07.195 --> 08:09.530
-I think there's something here.
-I think it's good.

08:09.614 --> 08:13.910
Dinosaur, tacos. Nice little conveyor belt
to have him spit out the mouth.

08:13.993 --> 08:15.453
I don't think it's bad at all.

08:15.536 --> 08:17.663
Visually, it's a huge dinosaur
that shoots out tacos.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.248
-Who doesn't love that?
-It's good.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.585
We can cross-pollinate all of our skills.
I think it's gonna be a good one.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.003
Exciting! Don't be so excited.

08:24.086 --> 08:25.796
-You might poop yourselves.
-Too late.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.717
-All right, guys, we're gonna do it.
<i>-Yes!</i>

08:29.800 --> 08:33.471
A dinosaur that shoots
candy tacos out of his mouth. We're good?

08:33.554 --> 08:36.265
-<i>Yeah!</i>
-We'll let you know when it's done.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.226
-See you later!

08:38.809 --> 08:40.144
45 years of build experience,

08:40.228 --> 08:42.897
we're making a dinosaur
that spits tacos out of his mouth.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.482
At least it's not a Fart Humidifier.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.490
Let's figure this thing out.

08:52.573 --> 08:54.742
To get to where we're going,
we need to have a dinosaur.

08:54.825 --> 08:56.953
So let me draw the big T. rex.

08:57.036 --> 09:00.665
What are we building this out of?
Plywood and then covering it with foam?

09:00.748 --> 09:03.834
Uh, the two-inch thick insulation foam
on top of the plywood?

09:03.918 --> 09:06.587
We'll glue it down.
A combination of that expanding stuff.

09:06.671 --> 09:09.757
The head, we put a lot of detail
in, 'cause that'll be kind of the focus.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.509
Oh, definitely. Yeah. How big the teeth?

09:12.093 --> 09:14.220
How are we all going to get this
all attached together?

09:14.303 --> 09:17.431
The body's gonna be its own thing.
The head's gonna be its own thing.

09:17.515 --> 09:20.476
Do we have one main pivot point
that goes through the neck?

09:21.102 --> 09:24.188
I see what you're saying.
So the jaw can pivot on there as well.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.357
-Right.
-Potentially. That's a good idea.

09:26.440 --> 09:29.193
Are the tacos gonna drop out of
the mouth there? Or what's gonna happen?

09:29.277 --> 09:32.113
Yeah. The jaw will open up,
and the taco's gonna go…

09:32.655 --> 09:34.407
We're gonna put a conveyor belt.

09:34.490 --> 09:37.702
The belt is gonna be in the body,
like a straight shot behind the hump.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.288
Oh, and it goes all the way up
into the mouth.

09:40.371 --> 09:42.915
Yeah, the tacos
are gonna come up here.

09:42.999 --> 09:46.544
And how are you gonna power
the conveyor belt? Hand-crank? Motor?

09:46.627 --> 09:47.753
I see it like this.

09:47.837 --> 09:50.631
I'm gonna draw it just outside the body.
It's gonna come like this…

09:50.715 --> 09:53.843
So build it totally separate,
then we put it in after.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.971
We can put that clicky sound.
Remember I said we get that "click"?

09:57.054 --> 09:59.807
We could put a one-way ratchet here
so that when you're clicking it,

09:59.890 --> 10:02.059
it creates tension, that clickety sound.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.269
I think it could work.

10:03.352 --> 10:05.646
How are we gonna do this?
Jackman, what do you want to take?

10:05.730 --> 10:08.149
I'll do the head. I like
the mechanics of it. That'll be fun.

10:08.232 --> 10:09.817
-The head?
-Yeah. I'll help you.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.902
Eric, you and me
on the body and conveyor belt?

10:11.986 --> 10:13.446
-Sure, that'll work. Yeah.
-All right?

10:13.529 --> 10:14.905
-Pat?
-Wanna work on the teeth?

10:20.369 --> 10:23.122
-I think that's a yes.
-He's gonna work on the teeth.

10:23.205 --> 10:24.999
-Sounds good.
-Let's get materials.

10:34.634 --> 10:35.968
-Some plywood.
-Okay.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.054
-A couple two-by-fours.
-Okay.

10:38.846 --> 10:39.930
Two-by-twos.

10:40.014 --> 10:41.474
Okay. All right.

10:42.099 --> 10:44.977
I'll grab two of the epoxies.
This is the stuff we need.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.187
Why is it so heavy?

10:48.064 --> 10:49.273
Okay.

10:50.900 --> 10:51.901
We gotta make the body.

10:52.943 --> 10:55.696
Now, obviously,
our specialty isn't building dinosaurs,

10:55.780 --> 10:59.241
but we do know a few things
about structural integrity.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.995
The first thing we have to do
is cut an outline of the body

11:03.079 --> 11:04.747
from three-quarter-inch plywood.

11:09.669 --> 11:13.506
Then we attach the two sides
of the body together with two-by-fours.

11:14.298 --> 11:16.467
Bring the knee forward a touch more maybe.

11:17.051 --> 11:20.304
None of us have built a giant dinosaur,
but we can build anything.

11:21.889 --> 11:23.099
We're pros.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.567
I'd like to see it
get a little bit of a tail.

11:39.824 --> 11:42.702
Now that the dino body
is pretty solid, it's time to take it 3D.

11:42.785 --> 11:45.162
Add some foam, some shape, some dimension.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.124
The body's coming along quick,

11:48.207 --> 11:51.127
so hopefully Graz and Jackman
can keep up with that head.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.549
-Where were we?
-Where am I?

11:56.632 --> 11:58.259
-We're gonna build the boxes.
-Yeah.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.139
To make a solid head
for a giant dinosaur,

12:03.222 --> 12:05.891
first, we have to make a mold box
that's mostly dinosaur-head shaped.

12:05.975 --> 12:08.728
It's already looking
like a dinosaur skull. I see it.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.563
But with a long-brim fishing hat.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.273
-When it's really, really sunny out.
-Yeah.

12:12.356 --> 12:15.443
{Jackman] 'Cause we have an articulating
jaw, we need to make two boxes.

12:15.943 --> 12:17.903
One for the top of the head
and one for the bottom.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.990
If all goes according to plan,
we'll have a nice foam form.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.534
We can strip these off
and then carve it down to shape.

12:23.617 --> 12:25.119
-Oh!

12:25.202 --> 12:26.954
-That was a wasp.
-Whoa.

12:27.037 --> 12:29.373
-I think it just stung me.
-Are you serious?

12:29.457 --> 12:31.250
Oh, yeah. It's… Yeah, it's…

12:31.333 --> 12:33.043
He got you right there.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.379
-Do you want me to suck out the poison?
-Can you?

12:36.088 --> 12:36.922
Yo, guys!

12:37.798 --> 12:38.632
Guys!

12:40.551 --> 12:41.802
Yo, hey!

12:42.636 --> 12:43.512
Jimmy!

12:44.972 --> 12:46.515
We had our first accident.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.601
Uh, Jackman got stung by a wasp.

12:53.230 --> 12:55.232
-Right here.
-Did you really get stung?

12:55.316 --> 12:57.151
-Yeah.
-I can just kiss it.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.198
-You smell good.
-Thank you.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.324
-Bye.

13:06.494 --> 13:07.328
All right.

13:07.411 --> 13:09.705
-I think this box is ready to go.
-That should be good.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.874
We're gonna pour the foam in this.
Two-part foam.

13:11.957 --> 13:16.754
It mixes as a liquid, turns to a solid,
and expands 11, 10 times or so.

13:16.837 --> 13:19.215
It looks like a rising loaf of bread.
It's gonna look awesome.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.801
So let's do some math.
We'll figure out the volume of this guy,

13:21.884 --> 13:23.844
figure out what 1/11th of that is,

13:23.928 --> 13:26.764
and then we'll carve it down
once it's solid in an hour or so.

13:28.516 --> 13:31.268
Let's call this 14, and then this one 6.

13:31.352 --> 13:34.230
-So, Graz, 8,760. Remember that number.
-8,760.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.816
Divided by whatever 144 times 12 is.

13:36.899 --> 13:40.569
What is 36 times 20 times… 5?

13:41.153 --> 13:42.321
Oh, God.

13:42.404 --> 13:43.572
Ten? Thirteen.

13:43.656 --> 13:47.117
We're gonna do 12. So three cubic feet.
So one and a half of these kits will fill…

13:47.201 --> 13:49.161
Is this all you guys have done?

13:49.245 --> 13:52.373
Yeah. I'm sorry, this is
the best-looking part of the dinosaur.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.250
-What part is it?
-The good part.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.752
You might want
to work on it a bit more.

13:56.836 --> 13:57.711
All right.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.714
Go work on your dinosaur,
we gotta get to pouring.

14:01.215 --> 14:02.883
Don't touch anything either.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.594
-So 79--
-Dude, let's just pour.

14:06.345 --> 14:07.596
-Okay.
-Yeah.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.390
-We're doing this?
-Yeah. Let's do it.

14:14.728 --> 14:16.605
<i>-All right, go.
</i>

14:18.732 --> 14:21.402
-Are… Are you as excited as I am?
-Yeah.

14:29.410 --> 14:32.079
-The foam's pretty cool.
-It is very cool.

14:38.460 --> 14:41.338
This is Canadian Pat,
known for three things,

14:41.422 --> 14:43.424
two of which are not having sleeves.

14:43.507 --> 14:45.801
Third being the lathe.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.761
This is the lathe.

14:48.387 --> 14:49.889
It's more than my friend.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.056
It's my lover.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.516
Aww!

14:52.600 --> 14:55.477
Anyway, today,
I'm gonna turn some dino teeths.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.813
And to do that, I'm gonna take that dowel,

14:57.897 --> 14:59.982
install it in the chuck and then spin it.

15:01.442 --> 15:04.612
It takes a long time to learn
the lathe, but Pat is a master.

15:05.112 --> 15:07.364
He can pretty much make anything
on this machine.

15:07.448 --> 15:08.365
Let's do this!

15:15.539 --> 15:17.833
The lathe spins the wood
really fast.

15:17.917 --> 15:22.379
I just take this U-shaped turning tool,
called the gouge, hold my hand steady,

15:22.463 --> 15:26.383
and cut away little pieces of wood
until it looks like a cute dino tooth.

15:29.136 --> 15:30.888
Hey, guys. Do we need more?

15:30.971 --> 15:33.307
-A couple more.
-Yeah, we need a bunch more.

15:33.390 --> 15:34.934
-Three, four?
-Fifteen?

15:35.017 --> 15:36.101
Twenty?

15:40.522 --> 15:41.398
Oh.

15:41.482 --> 15:42.858
I think I felt it move.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.864
We finished the dinosaur skeleton.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.575
The next step is gonna put
the two-inch insulation foam on it.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.411
We're gonna glue it between
all the seams and glue it to the plywood.

15:54.495 --> 15:56.747
That'll give it some real gravitas.

15:56.830 --> 15:58.165
What's gravitas?

15:58.916 --> 16:00.084
Never mind.

16:02.044 --> 16:06.715
Typically, this pink polystyrene foam
is used for insulation on houses.

16:08.676 --> 16:11.637
But it's the perfect material
to add some shape to our dinosaur

16:11.720 --> 16:13.472
without adding a lot of weight.

16:13.555 --> 16:16.100
They're gonna show all this on the show?
All this building?

16:16.183 --> 16:18.394
No. They're gonna waste
millions of megabytes

16:18.477 --> 16:20.229
on footage they're not gonna use.

16:20.312 --> 16:23.399
Then just do a big montage?
To what type of music they'll use?

16:23.482 --> 16:26.485
- They'll use some fake-ass AC/
- DC.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.077
Now that we got
all the foam glued together,

16:35.160 --> 16:37.579
we're gonna start sculpting it
with the hot wire.

16:38.747 --> 16:39.915
That gets hot quick.

16:39.999 --> 16:43.085
That'll make it look more like
a real three-dimensional dinosaur,

16:44.586 --> 16:47.589
and less like a bunch of foam pieces
glued to a plywood frame.

16:50.009 --> 16:53.595
I think it looks good! The gesture,
the shape, the volume is starting to show.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.889
-Yeah.
-Now, I kind of care.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.224
I knew you'd love it.

16:57.307 --> 17:00.436
I'm gonna work on rounding this out,
you can sweep up yourself.

17:01.937 --> 17:02.938
Thank you.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.149
Now that the foam is hardened,

17:05.232 --> 17:09.528
it's time for Graz and Jackman
to open up that box and see what we got.

17:11.238 --> 17:12.448
Does that look good?

17:12.948 --> 17:13.907
That's pretty good.

17:13.991 --> 17:15.576
So the conveyor belt that goes back here,

17:15.659 --> 17:17.911
that's where the tacos'll pop up
inside the dinosaur.

17:17.995 --> 17:19.538
-Like that. Yeah.
-Perfect.

17:22.541 --> 17:23.792
All right.

17:23.876 --> 17:27.171
I think the next thing we do
is bring it to the band saw

17:27.254 --> 17:29.381
and start cutting the jawline.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.967
This is probably a two-man job
'cause it's so big,

17:32.051 --> 17:34.261
but, um, after that, what do you wanna do?

17:34.344 --> 17:37.431
Probably some handsaws
to get it kind of chunky-shaped,

17:37.514 --> 17:40.142
and then power-carving
with an angle grinder?

17:40.225 --> 17:41.935
That'll do all the detail stuff.

17:42.019 --> 17:43.353
-Cool.
-Cool.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.564
-Yeah.
-I got it.

17:45.647 --> 17:47.316
Yep. Thanks.

17:47.399 --> 17:48.776
Yep, thanks. I got it.

17:48.859 --> 17:51.361
-This is marine flotation foam.

17:51.445 --> 17:54.239
Strictly used in things like boats
and surfboard repair.

17:54.323 --> 17:55.616
You drive, I'll guide.

17:56.283 --> 17:57.785
Because of its fairly low density,

17:57.868 --> 18:00.120
a band saw cuts
through the foam like butter.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.751
And it's easy
to fine-tune with hand tools.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.504
Because we poured
such a large mass of foam,

18:08.587 --> 18:10.464
the heat buildup caused a few cracks.

18:10.964 --> 18:14.426
Those are easy to fill and shape later,
so you won't know they were there.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.096
Ta-da! I finished the teeth.

18:17.179 --> 18:18.555
Dude, you killed it.

18:18.639 --> 18:20.516
Jackman, Graz.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.142
Yeah, and Pat.

18:28.023 --> 18:30.859
And now, on to the eyes!

18:32.152 --> 18:33.779
Now that we have the rough shape

18:33.862 --> 18:35.823
we can prepare the head
for the teeth and eyes.

18:36.573 --> 18:37.783
Dude, they look great.

18:38.617 --> 18:42.079
-It looks so dumb.
-The goofiest-looking dinosaur.

18:42.162 --> 18:43.205
I love it!

18:45.999 --> 18:48.085
-Can you get that piece there?
-Yeah.

18:48.168 --> 18:51.630
What you see us doing here
is putting brown craft paper

18:51.713 --> 18:55.676
and just regular white glue,
just crafting glue. It creates a skin.

18:55.759 --> 18:57.302
Papier-mâché, if you will.

18:57.386 --> 19:00.389
If you have an extra 14 gallons
of white glue laying around,

19:00.472 --> 19:01.598
you could do this too.

19:01.682 --> 19:03.475
It's gonna look like real skin.

19:03.559 --> 19:06.270
All right. This is starting
to look like a real dinosaur.

19:06.353 --> 19:08.230
You good working for a few minutes alone?

19:08.814 --> 19:11.567
-Why? Where you going?
-I'm gonna work on the conveyor belt.

19:12.484 --> 19:13.986
And I'm stuck doing this?

19:14.820 --> 19:16.697
Oh, okay.

19:16.780 --> 19:20.033
What you see here
is the taco delivery system.

19:20.617 --> 19:23.745
It's gonna be the conveyor belt
inside of the dinosaur.

19:23.829 --> 19:24.663
Jimmy?

19:25.205 --> 19:27.541
And this is a little model
of our dinosaur.

19:27.624 --> 19:30.127
The conveyor belt's
gonna be right inside the body

19:30.210 --> 19:31.587
and come up through the mouth.

19:31.670 --> 19:32.504
Jimmy?

19:33.005 --> 19:35.382
Each one of these disks
pile together

19:35.465 --> 19:38.177
to make the roller end
of the conveyor belt,

19:38.260 --> 19:41.221
and the conveyor belt's
gonna roll on each end like that.

19:41.305 --> 19:42.639
-Since--
-Jimmy?

19:42.723 --> 19:44.391
What do you need?

19:44.474 --> 19:47.060
I have a feeling you're not coming back
to help me finish this.

19:47.144 --> 19:49.313
Soon as I'm done with this, my dear,
I will come.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.149
Okay, conveyor belt.

20:01.158 --> 20:03.952
We have a nice, smooth action.
It works really well.

20:20.969 --> 20:24.223
So that's gonna be the clicker mechanism.
So when we crank this,

20:24.306 --> 20:26.266
it has a one-way positive motion.

20:29.102 --> 20:32.022
You won't be able to go backwards
to un-deliver the taco.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.786
<i>Attention, Jimmy.</i>
<i>Children calling.</i>

20:45.869 --> 20:48.580
<i>-Attention, Jimmy. Children calling.</i>

20:50.958 --> 20:52.751
-<i>Jimmy!</i>
-Jimmy?

20:53.252 --> 20:55.462
-<i>Jimmy!</i>
-I think you're wanted.

20:55.963 --> 20:58.340
-So what's going on?
-<i>We have a couple of questions.</i>

20:58.423 --> 21:00.676
All right. We got a lotta work.
Let's hear it.

21:02.010 --> 21:04.805
-<i>Are you guys done building the dinosaur?</i>
-No.

21:05.389 --> 21:08.183
<i>Will someone be able to go inside of it?</i>

21:08.267 --> 21:09.101
No, next!

21:09.184 --> 21:11.937
<i>Will he be a mean dinosaur?</i>

21:12.020 --> 21:13.438
No!

21:13.522 --> 21:15.190
<i>-What color is he?</i>
What?

21:15.274 --> 21:16.358
<i>What color is he?</i>

21:16.441 --> 21:17.693
What color did you want?

21:19.069 --> 21:20.195
<i>-Black!</i>
<i>-Black! Black!</i>

21:20.279 --> 21:22.948
It's not that color.
What's next? What's the next question?

21:23.031 --> 21:25.075
<i>How far can it spit the tacos?</i>

21:25.158 --> 21:25.993
Far enough.

21:26.076 --> 21:26.910
<i>Yay!</i>

21:27.953 --> 21:30.038
Get to the point! Get to the point!

21:30.706 --> 21:33.250
<i>Well, there's something</i>
<i>we forgot to tell you.</i>

21:34.626 --> 21:38.338
<i>After eating all of those tacos,</i>
<i>he's gonna need a toilet, because--</i>

21:38.422 --> 21:40.173
<i>Because poo-poo.</i>

21:42.384 --> 21:43.969
<i>Bonus request!</i>

21:45.429 --> 21:46.888
<i>That sucks.</i>

21:46.972 --> 21:48.682
Toilet poo-poo?

21:48.765 --> 21:50.517
What are you talking about here?

21:50.600 --> 21:52.477
We are way too far along
to make adjustments.

21:52.561 --> 21:55.272
<i>He needs a toilet.</i>

21:55.355 --> 21:56.565
-All right.
-<i>Yay!</i>

21:56.648 --> 21:58.817
What if we put
the toilet between his feet?

21:58.900 --> 22:01.945
And whoever is gonna be catching
the taco sits on the toilet?

22:02.029 --> 22:03.572
<i>-Okay.</i>

22:03.655 --> 22:05.615
All right, Dino Taco Toilet.

22:07.034 --> 22:08.452
-We'll figure it out.
<i>-Yay!</i>

22:08.535 --> 22:09.786
-We're good?
-<i>Yeah!</i>

22:09.870 --> 22:11.163
<i>Toilet! Toilet! Toilet!</i>

22:11.246 --> 22:12.748
-Pull the plug.
Bye, guys.

22:17.085 --> 22:18.545
So the kid wants a toilet.

22:18.628 --> 22:20.380
Underneath is not possible.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.883
We could potentially
put a toilet right here.

22:24.551 --> 22:25.719
Taco's gonna fall.

22:26.219 --> 22:29.222
Anybody sitting on the toilet will
catch it. It'll be like a makeshift seat.

22:29.306 --> 22:31.516
-So if we put it there…
-Yeah?

22:31.600 --> 22:34.061
…which way
should the toilet be facing?

22:34.144 --> 22:35.771
Facing in like that?

22:35.854 --> 22:38.315
Yeah, but if you face it that way,

22:38.398 --> 22:40.609
you're gonna be staring
right at the dinosaur's--

22:40.692 --> 22:44.112
Jimmy, why don't we just make
the toilet instead of buying one?

22:44.196 --> 22:45.739
This is a show about making stuff.

22:45.822 --> 22:48.950
Have it face that way. Like he said,
catch it over your shoulder.

22:49.034 --> 22:52.371
We can do like an outhouse toilet…
out of wooden planks.

22:52.454 --> 22:55.248
Yeah, maybe I can make a<i> pot de chambre.</i>

22:55.332 --> 22:57.167
Like a chamber pot.

22:57.250 --> 23:00.837
A chamber pot. Like a pot that goes
underneath. Like an outhouse toilet.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.840
-You're okay building the toilet seat?
-Yeah.

23:03.924 --> 23:05.592
-You build the chamber pot.
-Yup.

23:05.675 --> 23:08.637
You continue ruining the head, you two.
Let's get back to work.

23:15.143 --> 23:18.021
So I'm about to turn that log
into a chamber pot.

23:18.105 --> 23:19.564
What is a chamber pot, you ask?

23:19.648 --> 23:22.526
Well, it's just a bowl
that collects…

23:26.321 --> 23:28.490
I'm going to turn
the chamber pot on the lathe,

23:28.573 --> 23:32.494
but first, I have to cut this wood down
to a more manageable size.

23:33.161 --> 23:33.995
Let's do this.

23:38.458 --> 23:40.794
Woo-hoo!

23:42.629 --> 23:44.423
Agh!

24:05.694 --> 24:07.112
Okay, that's better.

24:07.195 --> 24:09.865
But this piece
is still too big for the lathe,

24:09.948 --> 24:12.534
so I need to round it up a bit
before I start turning it.

24:12.617 --> 24:13.827
Let's go to the band saw now.

24:17.747 --> 24:19.541
And now, off to the lathe.

24:19.624 --> 24:20.834
Let's have some fun.

24:26.923 --> 24:28.091
Woo-hoo!

24:35.932 --> 24:38.101
This kind of wood
is called white ash.

24:38.185 --> 24:39.144
<i>White ash.</i>

24:39.769 --> 24:41.354
It is still green on the inside,

24:41.438 --> 24:44.024
which just means
it's still got some moisture in it.

24:44.107 --> 24:47.611
And that's a good thing
because it makes it a little softer

24:47.694 --> 24:49.613
and easier to shape into a bowl.

24:51.948 --> 24:53.909
I really like turning green wood

24:54.493 --> 24:56.995
because the sap from the tree
lubricates the tool,

24:57.078 --> 24:58.747
and then it cuts like butter.

24:59.915 --> 25:02.167
This pooping bowl is almost complete.

25:02.250 --> 25:05.837
It just needs a friend
to make him a seat.

25:05.921 --> 25:08.507
So I'm gonna make a toilet
for the dinosaur.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.300
Gonna make a little pooper for it.

25:10.383 --> 25:12.677
Not gonna really be
a regular type of toilet,

25:12.761 --> 25:14.638
more of an outhouse type of toilet.

25:14.721 --> 25:17.432
What I'm gonna do
is screw these boards down

25:17.516 --> 25:18.642
to have a little seat.

25:19.809 --> 25:21.728
Gonna cut a hole in the top here,

25:21.811 --> 25:24.606
so you can sit on it,
you know, to do your business.

25:24.689 --> 25:27.984
I never used a pooper like this before,
but it should work.

25:29.861 --> 25:31.696
-That'll work.

25:31.780 --> 25:33.740
This is gonna be the base for it.

25:35.075 --> 25:37.160
A clean bowl is a happy bowl.

25:39.913 --> 25:41.164
Whoo.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.795
-All right, see how it looks?
-Think it's ready.

25:47.462 --> 25:48.463
All right.

25:50.090 --> 25:52.509
-You gonna drop it? Ready?
-It's so heavy.

25:52.592 --> 25:54.052
-Drop it.
-Yeah.

25:56.471 --> 25:57.305
Here.

25:57.847 --> 25:59.933
-You got it?
-Grab the nose.

26:00.016 --> 26:01.142
-I got it.
-I'll climb up.

26:01.226 --> 26:02.727
I'll catch it if it falls.

26:04.187 --> 26:06.565
-Oh boy.
-Oh God. Is it really that heavy?

26:06.648 --> 26:08.650
-Oh boy.
-I thought you're holding it back.

26:08.733 --> 26:09.985
You guys get it?

26:12.279 --> 26:13.154
Ah, there you go.

26:13.738 --> 26:16.992
Oh my God, it looks amazing. 

26:17.075 --> 26:19.995
-It looks really good!
-The teeth makes it all.

26:20.078 --> 26:21.329
It really does.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.456
Seriously the teeth look amazing, Pat.

26:23.540 --> 26:26.418
Derek, let's give this a throw-in.
Let's see what happens.

26:26.918 --> 26:28.128
So we have a dinosaur,

26:28.211 --> 26:31.172
but these little brats asked
for a taco-spitting dinosaur,

26:31.256 --> 26:33.550
so we need to get
the conveyor belt installed.

26:33.633 --> 26:36.469
Paul, can you reach in and grab it?
'Cause I can't go up any higher.

26:36.553 --> 26:37.679
Kind of.

26:37.762 --> 26:39.889
We're not gonna be able
to go up and over this.

26:39.973 --> 26:41.891
And that's too high right there.

26:41.975 --> 26:43.602
Yeah, that's too high.

26:43.685 --> 26:45.854
We left the space
for the conveyor belt,

26:45.937 --> 26:49.399
but it's not big enough.
So we'll have to make some adjustments.

26:49.482 --> 26:50.400
What do you think?

26:50.483 --> 26:52.068
-You know best.
-All right.

26:52.152 --> 26:54.154
-You're the smartest man in the room.
-Ah! Jesus!

26:54.237 --> 26:56.948
-Well, I'll take that back.
-There's a tool for every job.

26:57.032 --> 26:59.868
And sometimes that tool is a chainsaw.

26:59.951 --> 27:02.203
Tell my kids I love… like them a lot.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.293
What is he cutting out?

27:08.376 --> 27:10.795
The whole structure
that was holding it together.

27:10.879 --> 27:13.423
All right, we can always remove one.
Don't go crazy.

27:13.506 --> 27:15.133
Perfect fit. Moving on.

27:15.216 --> 27:18.136
The only thing
is to get the mouth to open and close.

27:18.219 --> 27:21.848
So what should happen
is this counterweight will close the jaw.

27:21.931 --> 27:23.850
Then the weight of the tacos will open it,

27:23.933 --> 27:27.020
but I don't think the weight
is gonna be enough to open this.

27:27.103 --> 27:28.730
We're gonna need something more.

27:28.813 --> 27:31.232
Maybe if we make really big, heavy tacos--

27:31.316 --> 27:33.276
-Yeah, like a brick taco?
-Yeah.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.695
The plan was to balance the jaw
with a counterweight

27:35.779 --> 27:37.989
so the weight of the tacos pop it open,

27:38.073 --> 27:40.617
but we failed to account for one fact.

27:40.700 --> 27:43.036
Tacos don't weigh that much.

27:43.119 --> 27:45.538
-Will the boys solve the problem?

27:45.622 --> 27:49.334
Oh, problems, problems.

27:49.417 --> 27:51.878
<i>We got a problem! Problem!</i>

27:52.504 --> 27:55.548
So instead of relying
on gravity and taco mass,

27:55.632 --> 27:58.218
we're gonna have to find a way
to use the rotating motion

27:58.301 --> 28:00.804
of the conveyor belt
to open and close the jaw.

28:03.765 --> 28:06.935
I wanna explain what's happening. This is
the axle at the top of the conveyor.

28:07.018 --> 28:09.229
So if we put a cam on the end,

28:09.312 --> 28:11.523
screw a block right there,
and when that rotates

28:11.606 --> 28:14.234
as the conveyor belts going… Ta-dunk.

28:14.317 --> 28:16.194
-Ta-dunk.
-That's the noise it makes.

28:16.277 --> 28:18.530
So every rotation
of the crank down at the bottom…

28:18.613 --> 28:19.531
-Yep.
-Yep.

28:19.614 --> 28:21.324
…you'll get a jaw opening at the top.

28:21.408 --> 28:25.495
And then to return the jaw back up,
we'll put some rubber bands here

28:25.578 --> 28:27.330
that go like that and pull the jaw--

28:27.414 --> 28:29.999
-Closed.
-Yup. Let's give this a shot.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.336
I also reduced the friction
in the jaw pivot,

28:33.420 --> 28:35.463
so the jaw now has no friction in it.

28:36.047 --> 28:38.049
I'm gonna push the conveyor up by hand.

28:38.133 --> 28:40.719
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Is it working?

28:40.802 --> 28:42.512
-It's working. That's perfect!
-It is.

28:42.595 --> 28:44.222
-Is it?
-Look at that!

28:44.305 --> 28:45.849
Test taco, go.

28:48.893 --> 28:51.020
-Bam! It's perfect.
-Did he get it?

28:52.439 --> 28:53.815
Problem solved.

28:55.150 --> 28:56.359
Problem solved!

29:00.905 --> 29:04.367
We gotta paint. We gotta put the tabs
on the conveyor belt to hold the tacos.

29:04.451 --> 29:06.619
Let's keep things moving along, let's go!

29:06.703 --> 29:10.248
We're almost there, but a build like this
has a lot of details to finish up,

29:10.331 --> 29:12.792
so it's time for everybody to pitch in.

29:13.293 --> 29:15.503
I put Pat in charge
of some dinosaur toenails.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.756
That's good.
That's right on the right spot.

29:17.839 --> 29:20.049
I'll take those toenails
over mine any day.

29:20.133 --> 29:22.218
Yeah, but how we gonna
physically attach them?

29:22.302 --> 29:24.137
Cut it flat and glue it in place.

29:24.220 --> 29:26.139
That's not a plan. They're gonna fall off.

29:26.222 --> 29:29.392
When he goes to the store and goes
and gets his own coffee, they'll fall off.

29:29.476 --> 29:31.519
But that's never gonna happen,
so they won't fall off.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.980
Perfect. Thanks.
Go back to where you were.

29:34.063 --> 29:34.898
Thank you!

29:35.648 --> 29:39.444
As for me, I'm sculpting
some tiny T. rex arms on the band saw.

29:44.741 --> 29:45.867
Derek.

29:45.950 --> 29:46.868
Pssh!

29:50.580 --> 29:53.500
Raise the roof!
Whoop-whoop!

29:53.583 --> 29:56.795
Jackman, Graz, and Derek
are gluing on little round pegs

29:56.878 --> 29:58.505
that'll hold the tacos in place.

29:59.881 --> 30:02.050
-Do it. You won't.

30:02.133 --> 30:05.720
I'm making sure
that none of these taco pegs get stuck.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.264
-Oh, there it goes! Oh, there it goes!
-Yay!

30:08.348 --> 30:10.099
Here we go! Here we go!

30:10.183 --> 30:11.142
So excited.

30:16.022 --> 30:18.900
And I'm installing the hand crank
that will power the conveyor belt.

30:20.485 --> 30:22.570
Everything is finally coming together.

30:22.654 --> 30:25.073
After all this work, I have to admit it,

30:25.156 --> 30:28.660
I'm pretty excited to actually see
this taco-spitting T. rex in action.

30:29.202 --> 30:31.204
-It works!
-Dude, it works!

30:35.834 --> 30:38.837
It's done.
Asher and Farah better appreciate this.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.047
-Lighten up.
-Look at this, it's beautiful!

30:41.130 --> 30:42.715
It should be in a frickin' museum.

30:42.799 --> 30:44.634
The pinnacle of your career.

31:00.650 --> 31:04.070
-Anybody else get burnt today?
-Yeah, what is going on with you guys?

31:04.153 --> 31:06.406
Pat, that's like
a Canadian sunburn right there?

31:06.489 --> 31:09.659
Yeah, like red and white, and maple leaf.

31:09.742 --> 31:11.870
You might want to invest
in sleeves next time.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.288
You guys ready to do this?

31:13.371 --> 31:14.247
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

31:14.330 --> 31:15.164
You ready?

31:15.790 --> 31:17.917
All right, let's talk to the kiddos.
Let's go!

31:19.043 --> 31:21.045
Hey, Asher. Farah.

31:21.129 --> 31:23.548
This is it, the big day, we're here.

31:23.631 --> 31:25.508
Remind me what you wanted.

31:25.592 --> 31:31.180
<i>I wanted a dinosaur that shoots tacos</i>
<i>out of its mouth, and it has a toilet.</i>

31:31.264 --> 31:34.058
-What did they say?
<i>-Dinosaur Taco Toilet!</i>

31:35.560 --> 31:37.478
I'm not gonna lie, it wasn't easy.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.814
Took us all week to figure it out,

31:40.481 --> 31:44.110
and I think you're gonna be very happy
with the results. Are you ready?

31:44.193 --> 31:45.570
<i>Yeah!</i>

31:46.279 --> 31:47.280
And here it is.

31:52.201 --> 31:53.369
<i>-Yeah.</i>

31:53.953 --> 31:55.455
So this doesn't impress you?

31:55.538 --> 31:57.624
<i>-No.</i>
-You ungrateful little brats.

31:57.707 --> 31:59.000
<i>It better be something else.</i>

31:59.083 --> 32:00.919
-So you don't like this?
<i>-No!</i>

32:01.002 --> 32:03.004
-Do you wanna see the real thing?
-<i>Yeah!</i>

32:03.087 --> 32:05.089
-Are you ready?
<i>-Yes!</i>

32:05.173 --> 32:06.549
All right, hit it.

32:15.099 --> 32:16.184
<i>Yeah!</i>

32:19.020 --> 32:20.271
<i>-Dinosaur!</i>
-<i>Dino!</i>

32:21.731 --> 32:23.066
<i>-Taco!</i>
-<i>Taco!</i>

32:24.734 --> 32:26.653
<i>-Toilet!</i>
-<i>Toilet!</i>

32:28.821 --> 32:30.156
<i>Tac-cocos!</i>

32:30.239 --> 32:33.159
-The taco dispenser's right up in here.

32:33.242 --> 32:37.205
We got the beautifully crafted teeth,
made by our friend here, Canadian Pat.

32:37.288 --> 32:39.332
The beautifully sculpted head,

32:40.166 --> 32:42.043
sculpted by Jackman and Graz.

32:42.126 --> 32:44.879
And the tacos are delivered
right onto the toilet,

32:44.963 --> 32:47.131
handcrafted by Derek from Malden.

32:47.715 --> 32:48.549
<i>Toilet!</i>

32:53.596 --> 32:56.265
-What do you think?
-<i>This is amazing!</i>

32:56.349 --> 32:57.684
<i>I want it!</i>

32:57.767 --> 33:00.019
I bet you guys wanna see
somebody sit on that toilet

33:00.103 --> 33:02.271
and get a taco dropped
in their mouth. Yes?

33:02.355 --> 33:03.356
<i>-Yeah!</i>
<i>-Yeah, yes!</i>

33:03.940 --> 33:06.401
<i>Wait, can you take a turd in it right now?</i>

33:06.484 --> 33:09.696
In due time, we'll make a crap
in the toilet just for you, my man.

33:09.779 --> 33:11.531
Who do you wanna see on the toilet?

33:11.614 --> 33:13.116
<i>-Dinosaur!</i>
<i>-Jimmy!</i>

33:13.199 --> 33:15.159
No, no, no, I'm the host of the show.

33:15.243 --> 33:16.536
I don't go on no toilets.

33:16.619 --> 33:19.122
Okay, Derek, get on the toilet.

33:19.205 --> 33:20.039
Me?

33:20.623 --> 33:22.542
-You guys are ready for this now?

33:22.625 --> 33:24.335
<i>Crank the lever.</i>

33:24.419 --> 33:27.547
What are we waiting for?
Let's get this thing fired up!

33:41.310 --> 33:42.812
Are you not entertained?

33:43.646 --> 33:47.275
Guys, you asked for something special,
not just regular tacos.

33:47.358 --> 33:50.278
-Do you remember what you asked for?
<i>-Candy tacos.</i>

33:50.361 --> 33:51.362
Candy tacos?

33:51.446 --> 33:52.655
<i>-Uh-huh.</i>
<i>-Yeah!</i>

33:52.739 --> 33:54.198
Do you see what that is?

33:54.699 --> 33:55.700
<i>Candy tacos.</i>

33:55.783 --> 33:57.952
Do you know how hard it is
to find candy tacos?

33:58.036 --> 33:59.287
<i>No.</i>

33:59.370 --> 34:00.538
Guys?

34:08.504 --> 34:09.630
<i>Yeah!</i>

34:16.012 --> 34:17.096
<i>-Yay!</i>
<i>-Yeah!</i>

34:20.099 --> 34:22.602
<i>Good job! Good, good boy!</i>

34:22.685 --> 34:24.520
Guys,
I think they're happy with it.

34:24.604 --> 34:26.647
-I think we've done our job.
-Mmm.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.900
You just had five grown men

34:28.983 --> 34:32.820
build a dinosaur that vomits tacos
into a toilet. Are you happy?

34:33.321 --> 34:34.655
<i>Yeah!</i>

34:34.739 --> 34:37.075
-Did I build what you wanted?
-<i>Yeah!</i>

34:37.158 --> 34:38.576
<i>You did awesome!</i>

34:38.659 --> 34:40.745
What are you still doing here?
Get off my farm!

34:40.828 --> 34:41.829
<i>Okay, bye-bye.</i>

34:43.247 --> 34:45.249
How many more of these
do we gotta build?

34:45.333 --> 34:48.002
I don't know, but I've never had
so much cheese in my pants.

34:48.086 --> 34:50.797
-What are we gonna do with this?
-Actually, I did one other time.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.673
But I rather not talk about it.

35:11.901 --> 35:16.197
Did you know Taco Tuesdays
are on Thursdays around here?

35:16.280 --> 35:17.448
How weird is th--

35:28.835 --> 35:30.837
Pat, what are you guys doing?

35:30.920 --> 35:31.838
Oh.

35:31.921 --> 35:33.131
No, we're just…

35:33.214 --> 35:35.508
What are you guys doing? Get out of here!
