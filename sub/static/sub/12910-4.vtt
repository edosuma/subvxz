00:26.990 --> 00:28.870
Treat me right.

00:30.740 --> 00:32.630
Gimme a good piece.

00:32.820 --> 00:35.000
Hey, give it here!

00:41.120 --> 00:43.300
This shit's good!

00:57.100 --> 01:00.530
What?
I'm takin' a toke, c'mon!

01:01.270 --> 01:02.400
No!

01:02.600 --> 01:04.910
- C'mon, I bring you money.
- Go!

01:05.610 --> 01:06.860
Go!

01:08.190 --> 01:10.080
- No, ten.
- One rock.

01:10.280 --> 01:12.580
- Ten!
' Stop it!

01:12.780 --> 01:14.250
He said ten euro!

01:15.490 --> 01:18.210
- C'mon, I'll bring it later.
- Stop it!

01:18.410 --> 01:21.130
Give me a rock, just one!

01:21.330 --> 01:23.220
I said stop!

02:20.020 --> 02:21.490
Hello?

02:21.680 --> 02:23.570
'113, your complaint?'

02:24.390 --> 02:26.900
I can hear shooting from my house.

02:30.230 --> 02:31.990
'Yes, they're shooting.'

02:32.190 --> 02:33.950
- 'Address?'
- Via Fuentes.

02:34.150 --> 02:37.500
- 'Anyone wounded?'
- I don't know.

04:23.050 --> 04:25.640
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Fuck off!

04:25.850 --> 04:27.520
You fuck off!

04:30.770 --> 04:32.660
Turn left.

04:37.860 --> 04:39.750
Turn right.

04:47.040 --> 04:49.340
Put your hands on the scanner.

05:03.510 --> 05:05.180
Strip.

05:20.650 --> 05:24.200
Soldier, we want no trouble here.

05:33.080 --> 05:37.470
This yard gets smaller every day,
Don Pietro.

05:37.670 --> 05:40.260
Don't worry, Antonio, when I get out,

05:40.470 --> 05:42.970
I'll send you a postcard of Vesuvius,

05:43.180 --> 05:44.850
improve your view.

05:45.050 --> 05:47.350
Look at them laugh! A postcard?

05:47.560 --> 05:50.360
- Don't you like Vesuvius?
- Send one to them too!

05:51.020 --> 05:53.110
Sure, I like Vesuvius!

05:59.440 --> 06:04.030
- Are you Pietro Savastano?
- What the fuck's it to you?

06:05.530 --> 06:07.620
I have to talk to you.

06:07.830 --> 06:10.130
Hear him? He has to talk to me.

06:10.330 --> 06:11.800
I heard.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.930
I came here just to meet with you.

06:17.420 --> 06:21.260
- And why's that?
- We gotta talk business.

06:21.460 --> 06:24.260
- Wow!
- It's somethin' big!

06:24.510 --> 06:27.440
What business? See where we are?

06:33.810 --> 06:36.530
See? End of discussion!

06:36.730 --> 06:39.860
Get out of the sun, chocolate bar,
you'll melt!

06:48.490 --> 06:51.000
Maybe I wasn't clear,

06:51.200 --> 06:54.550
I gotta get out,
I can't stay in here.

06:56.040 --> 07:00.430
The hearing's been postponed again,
I can't figure out why.

07:00.670 --> 07:03.680
- Till when?
- Nine months.

07:03.880 --> 07:06.390
What the fuck is it, a pregnancy?

07:06.590 --> 07:09.390
Pietro, I did all I could,
still nothing,

07:09.600 --> 07:11.680
the judge is smart,

07:11.930 --> 07:15.360
but they can't hold you much longer,
they'll have to release you.

07:18.100 --> 07:23.320
Counselor, that asshole warden
has me in a bind.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.830
There are loads of problems
on the outside.

07:26.030 --> 07:29.240
They gotta hear my voice,
in a year it'll be too late.

07:30.910 --> 07:32.800
There's just one solution...

07:35.210 --> 07:37.590
a transfer request.

07:37.790 --> 07:40.180
If you agree...

07:46.630 --> 07:49.140
By now even the monkeys out there

07:49.340 --> 07:52.890
think they can
sit at a table with men.

08:09.410 --> 08:12.120
Motherfucker!

08:13.580 --> 08:17.340
Can't even get a decent shower
in this shithole!

08:19.080 --> 08:21.380
Shower's no good here.

08:22.790 --> 08:25.510
Not going out?
Don't you like to play ball?

08:25.710 --> 08:29.260
Kids play, men talk business.

08:29.470 --> 08:31.140
Again?

08:32.140 --> 08:35.900
You don't get it.
You and me have nothing to say.

08:37.559 --> 08:40.360
Do you know crack addicts?

08:41.309 --> 08:43.400
They're bad business,

08:44.070 --> 08:47.410
it's dangerous work,
50 9200s too much,

08:47.610 --> 08:49.700
we can give 10.

08:51.530 --> 08:53.830
10 is good for you and for us.

09:04.250 --> 09:08.840
When my son was little,
I'd take him to see the monkeys

09:09.050 --> 09:12.810
and he said: "Daddy, how come

09:13.010 --> 09:16.770
such stupid animals
wanna do what people do?"

09:18.520 --> 09:21.950
Monkeys are nice
when they obey their master,

09:22.150 --> 09:25.990
because if they want to be in charge,
they're dangerous,

09:26.190 --> 09:28.280
they gotta be put down.

09:48.920 --> 09:53.390
We gotta talk, go over percentages.

09:59.720 --> 10:01.810
There's nothin' to say,

10:02.440 --> 10:04.740
we've already talked about this,

10:04.940 --> 10:08.070
you set the percentages
with Don Pietro personally.

10:08.270 --> 10:10.990
We can't change 'em.

10:11.650 --> 10:15.830
I know, that's why
I sent my man to jail,

10:16.030 --> 10:18.000
but Don Pietro won't talk to him.

10:21.200 --> 10:23.510
Tokumbo is like my brother,

10:23.710 --> 10:26.290
what he says is like me saying it,

10:26.500 --> 10:30.130
but if Don Pietro won't talk to him,
then I'll decide,

10:30.340 --> 10:33.140
next time we'll give you
only what we say.

10:33.340 --> 10:35.230
You don't get it,

10:35.430 --> 10:38.860
this is Italy,
we give the orders here!

10:39.060 --> 10:42.600
You gotta do what we say,
and that's it!

10:43.890 --> 10:47.860
Back home, they say if you pull
a rope too hard, the mule dies,

10:48.060 --> 10:50.860
then you'll have to carry
your own rocks for the house.

10:52.900 --> 10:56.750
Be an asshole
and I'll bury you under those rocks,

10:57.700 --> 11:00.000
you and yours!

11:03.750 --> 11:05.830
We just want to talk.

11:08.130 --> 11:10.430
There's trouble with the blacks.

11:12.460 --> 11:14.850
The monkeys
are the least of my problems.

11:15.050 --> 11:18.180
They gave less than half
of what they should

11:18.800 --> 11:22.350
and want to talk to you
or they won't work.

11:22.600 --> 11:27.490
Everyone wants to talk to me,
but I can't talk to anyone.

11:27.940 --> 11:30.030
The Africans sent a guy here.

11:32.110 --> 11:34.410
I have nothin' to say to them,

11:34.610 --> 11:37.540
not on the outside,
or in this shithole.

11:45.750 --> 11:49.290
Tell Ciro to take a ride with Gennaro

11:49.540 --> 11:52.470
to make these shit blacks
change their minds.

11:53.420 --> 11:57.380
You're sure?
Isn't it better to listen?

11:58.590 --> 12:00.890
We already have lots of problems.

12:13.860 --> 12:16.990
We can't let the Africans
dictate the rules to us,

12:17.200 --> 12:21.450
we can't, we'll solve a small problem

12:21.950 --> 12:24.670
and find another hundred
on our backs.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.430
Alright.

12:29.620 --> 12:31.380
I'll talk to Ciro, don't worry.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.300
Tell Ciro to take Gennarino with him.

13:07.830 --> 13:10.760
- Can I be honest with you?
- Sure.

13:10.960 --> 13:14.720
I know Dad doesn't want
the Africans to handle this area,

13:15.550 --> 13:18.050
but I think it's stupid.

13:18.260 --> 13:20.970
Your father's ruled this clan
for 2O years,

13:21.760 --> 13:23.650
he knows what he has to do.

13:23.850 --> 13:25.820
But does he know
there's just blacks here?

13:26.010 --> 13:28.940
Your father
doesn't consider this area,

13:29.310 --> 13:31.280
just the percentage,

13:31.480 --> 13:34.610
he doesn't give shit about the rest.

13:44.780 --> 13:48.540
I think it's a mistake,
if we want to keep control,

13:48.750 --> 13:51.250
we gotta be realistic.

13:59.260 --> 14:02.600
It didn't seem like Naples,
it seemed like Africa!

14:03.930 --> 14:07.560
That's their territory,
we can't do nothin' about it.

15:21.670 --> 15:24.600
They say they won't pay
a fuckin' thing more.

15:52.990 --> 15:55.300
Call a doctor!

15:59.630 --> 16:01.380
Get a doctor!

16:48.880 --> 16:51.680
'Please, don't leave me,

16:51.890 --> 16:53.640
I got only you...

16:54.140 --> 16:57.070
If you leave me, how can I live?'

17:03.440 --> 17:05.740
- Come here!
- Guards!

17:07.400 --> 17:08.660
Guards!

17:08.859 --> 17:10.530
Inspector!

17:14.530 --> 17:16.420
Guards!

17:28.720 --> 17:31.220
Savastano, to Administration!

17:54.570 --> 17:57.500
You have something to tell me,
Warden?

17:57.700 --> 17:59.590
I know you weren't there,

17:59.790 --> 18:02.920
but we don't have to watch the sky
to see where the rain's from.

18:04.170 --> 18:07.710
I've been saying that to myself
since I came here.

18:08.340 --> 18:11.470
L'll leave you
to grow old in solitary,

18:11.680 --> 18:14.810
and all visits and packages
are suspended, as of today.

18:15.010 --> 18:17.310
No problem, Warden,

18:17.510 --> 18:19.820
I can do without everything.

18:21.270 --> 18:24.200
But are you sure
you can do without me?

19:32.380 --> 19:33.850
Run!

20:36.440 --> 20:40.210
- You haven't touched your food?
- The chef can't cook.

20:40.410 --> 20:43.950
While you were in solitary,
another four people were hurt,

20:44.160 --> 20:46.250
this tension's no good for anybody.

20:46.450 --> 20:50.220
Your warden's making the mess,
I make things work.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.340
Your transfer request was denied,

20:57.050 --> 20:59.350
you have to stay here.

21:02.600 --> 21:05.810
I moved mountains, but nothing.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.660
Know what I think?

21:16.860 --> 21:18.620
What?

21:18.820 --> 21:22.370
The mess here is making things worse.

21:23.320 --> 21:26.260
You have to cut the hardline,

21:26.490 --> 21:29.290
if you want to live easy,
you have to open talks.

21:32.460 --> 21:34.430
You know why I am what I am.

21:37.340 --> 21:39.840
Even as a kid,

21:40.050 --> 21:44.010
if someone broke my balls,
I never stepped back.

21:48.770 --> 21:51.480
You keep doing your job,
counselor,

21:51.690 --> 21:54.190
and I'll keep doing mine.

22:12.290 --> 22:15.420
'I need a lover, I'll get one,

22:16.340 --> 22:18.220
then there'll be talkin' done.

22:20.260 --> 22:22.840
In this house there ain't no sun,

22:23.050 --> 22:25.220
always yellin',
no peace for no one...'

22:37.940 --> 22:39.490
Guards!

22:39.690 --> 22:41.160
Guards!

22:43.030 --> 22:46.040
We're gettin' flooded! Guards!

22:46.700 --> 22:49.000
What's it take for them to get here?

22:49.200 --> 22:51.290
You two, cell 40.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.170
Let's

22:53.370 --> 22:57.960
Titonna, Manna, Esposito
and Cozzolino, cell 6.

22:58.170 --> 22:59.210
Get moving!

22:59.420 --> 23:01.720
Titonna, are you sleeping? C'mon!

23:01.920 --> 23:04.010
The others upstairs.

23:06.140 --> 23:08.440
Put me with the African.

23:56.980 --> 23:59.280
You'll give me 30,

23:59.480 --> 24:01.150
instead of 50...

24:03.490 --> 24:05.990
if you help me tomorrow.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.020
It's over.

24:57.370 --> 24:59.880
- Hello, Don Pietro!
- Hello!

25:31.950 --> 25:34.530
Stop! What are you doing?

26:40.310 --> 26:42.810
If you stop, we can talk.

26:47.270 --> 26:50.200
I promise to do all I can
to meet your demands,

26:50.400 --> 26:52.910
but stop this!

27:07.630 --> 27:12.850
If you have requests,
get back in your cells first.

27:13.050 --> 27:15.980
This fucking warden's still talkin'!

28:15.450 --> 28:16.490
Please sit down.

28:34.340 --> 28:37.890
- Who's this?
- Big Man John, wrestling champ.

28:41.050 --> 28:43.440
Warden, he looks like you.

28:44.970 --> 28:47.900
My wife gave it to me,
she says so too.

28:50.060 --> 28:52.780
- Do you like wrestling?
- Only if I win.

28:54.820 --> 28:56.910
You can't always win.

29:02.950 --> 29:05.040
Alright, Warden.

29:07.960 --> 29:09.080
First floor,

29:09.290 --> 29:12.640
Tokumbo, cell 60, transfer.

29:15.670 --> 29:17.970
Tokumbo, did you hear that?

29:18.170 --> 29:21.100
Get your stuff together,
you're being transferred.

29:21.300 --> 29:22.980
Why?

29:23.220 --> 29:24.350
Why?

29:38.190 --> 29:39.670
Rino!

29:41.110 --> 29:44.250
- See who's in command?
- I knew it.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.170
I brought you a gift from Don Pietro.

29:47.370 --> 29:48.840
Thanks.

29:50.710 --> 29:52.790
- Take care.
- Bye.

30:24.910 --> 30:28.040
See what I had to think up
to get you back?

30:28.240 --> 30:31.380
The warden realizes
who's really in control.

30:39.550 --> 30:43.310
To Don Pietro Savastano!
Just Hamsik's as great.

30:43.510 --> 30:46.010
- He made another goal!
- He never misses.

30:46.220 --> 30:49.230
He made a nice goal
right up the warden's ass!

30:49.470 --> 30:51.780
To Don Pietro!

30:58.900 --> 31:02.660
- Don Pietro, we're all here.
- To you, Don Pietro!

31:03.910 --> 31:05.790
We're the best.

31:05.990 --> 31:08.920
- You can talk.
- 'Thank you all.

31:09.160 --> 31:11.880
We have to talk business.'

31:12.660 --> 31:14.550
First thing:

31:14.750 --> 31:19.140
weekly allowances
are upped to 500 euros,

31:19.340 --> 31:22.880
'cause inmates' families
shouldn't need for anything.

31:24.340 --> 31:27.890
We gotta find another contact
for what Comte can't give,

31:28.100 --> 31:31.860
but not that shithead
who's in such a rush to talk to me.

31:34.140 --> 31:36.450
We have to keep spreading out.

31:36.650 --> 31:39.450
In Melito, Caivano, Arzano,

31:39.650 --> 31:41.820
they have to realize it's us now.

31:43.450 --> 31:45.410
'We have to spread to lower Lazio,'

31:46.240 --> 31:48.130
all the way to Rome.

31:50.700 --> 31:53.830
'I have to talk to you alone,
Immortal.'

31:58.540 --> 32:00.100
You can talk.

32:02.920 --> 32:04.680
You have to do a job for me.

32:05.630 --> 32:10.850
'We gotta end it with
the "black market", it's no good.'

32:20.650 --> 32:22.740
We gotta stay on our toes!

32:23.400 --> 32:26.530
- You're sure you're okay with it?
- Yeah!

32:26.740 --> 32:30.080
Your dad will be really happy
you came with us!

32:30.280 --> 32:34.040
Fuck dad, I'm happy if you are.

33:03.110 --> 33:05.080
I gotta see the episode!

33:05.280 --> 33:07.990
- Give me a drag?
- We'll see a nice film tonight!

33:08.200 --> 33:09.670
First Don Antonio!

33:09.860 --> 33:12.370
The episode's on at 8:30.

33:13.540 --> 33:16.670
- When's the film start?
- At 9:10!

33:24.710 --> 33:28.970
Remember just one thing:
you have to stay in the car, okay?

33:30.050 --> 33:32.850
With the motor always running,
never get out!

33:33.050 --> 33:35.020
I understand, Ciro.

33:35.220 --> 33:37.310
Good, let's go!

33:38.230 --> 33:38.940
Go!

35:34.380 --> 35:36.470
What the fuck are you doin' here?

35:36.890 --> 35:39.190
Get moving, go!

35:40.220 --> 35:42.520
Go, move!

36:01.040 --> 36:04.170
- What did I say?
- Stay in the car, motor on.

36:04.370 --> 36:06.340
- But you?
- I got out.

36:06.540 --> 36:09.260
- And you turned the motor off.
- But I thought...

36:09.420 --> 36:13.260
Don't, just do what I say,
that's it!

36:21.930 --> 36:24.440
- I'm sorry, Ciro.
- Sorry my ass!

36:24.640 --> 36:28.400
Never get out of the car again,

36:28.610 --> 36:31.950
you have to always be ready to run,
hear me?

36:32.150 --> 36:35.080
If you weren't Savastano's son,
I'd cut your head off.

36:38.200 --> 36:40.290
Sorry, it won't happen again.

36:44.250 --> 36:47.180
I got scared and understood nothing.

36:58.010 --> 36:59.480
Gennaro,

37:01.390 --> 37:04.600
you weren't scared, okay?

37:05.930 --> 37:08.020
You got out of the car

37:09.060 --> 37:11.150
because you wanted to shoot,

37:12.400 --> 37:15.750
you wanted to waste one of those
shits with your own hands.

37:17.200 --> 37:18.320
Okay?

37:21.410 --> 37:23.500
You weren't scared.

37:25.540 --> 37:27.620
Let's

37:30.540 --> 37:32.010
Go!

37:36.840 --> 37:39.340
'Horrific, is the only way to describe

37:39.550 --> 37:43.100
the terrifying images of death
coming from Naples.

37:43.300 --> 37:45.610
A massacre of the black community,

37:45.850 --> 37:49.060
almost certainly ordered by
the godfathers of the drug trade...'

38:15.170 --> 38:17.890
You done? Get up.

38:22.260 --> 38:24.150
Stand up.

38:38.900 --> 38:40.990
Gennaro, you have to toughen up.

38:43.070 --> 38:44.540
You're a Savastano.

38:57.670 --> 39:01.020
Good! A deal's a deal,
right, Zecchinetta?

39:02.970 --> 39:05.270
You got lucky this time,

39:05.470 --> 39:07.970
we didn't come directly
to your house,

39:08.180 --> 39:11.940
so lots of people with no fucking
connection, lost their lives.

39:13.350 --> 39:16.490
You blacks are all the same at night,

39:18.070 --> 39:19.950
you lucked out,

39:21.070 --> 39:23.160
but don't try it again,

39:23.780 --> 39:27.130
'cause next time
we'll move in daylight

39:27.330 --> 39:29.630
and we don't miss in daylight.

39:35.250 --> 39:39.430
'In the silence of the night
you want to die,

39:40.670 --> 39:44.630
you have no air,
you lack breath and sigh,

39:46.300 --> 39:50.690
you made love all alone,
and then as your tears came,

39:50.890 --> 39:55.280
your heart is breaking
at the sound of my name.

39:55.900 --> 40:00.490
And your pillow
is stained with lipstick...'

40:00.690 --> 40:02.580
Don Pietro,

40:02.780 --> 40:04.870
the guards are here.

40:05.070 --> 40:06.740
The guards?

40:08.160 --> 40:10.460
What the fuck do they want?

40:24.260 --> 40:26.140
What's this?

40:26.760 --> 40:30.110
Go, Savastano, your lawyer's waiting.

41:07.090 --> 41:10.220
- Solitary?
- Nothing more can be done.

41:10.430 --> 41:12.730
They're transferring you
to a maximum security...

41:12.930 --> 41:13.980
Counselor,

41:14.520 --> 41:17.860
if I'm in solitary, it's over for me.

41:18.400 --> 41:23.610
The warden sent you the guard
you knew, just to screw you better.

41:26.400 --> 41:30.160
The phone call last night was bugged

41:30.370 --> 41:33.300
and there's nothing more I can do.

41:34.830 --> 41:37.330
Read it yourself,

41:38.080 --> 41:40.800
they put it all down,
nothing's missing:

41:41.000 --> 41:43.090
the drugs they found on you,

41:43.340 --> 41:45.840
the attempt to bribe
the police officer,

41:46.050 --> 41:50.720
and what you ordered
by phone last night

41:51.850 --> 41:54.150
it's more than enough for them.

42:12.410 --> 42:14.490
A car!

42:31.680 --> 42:34.180
Ciro, is it all okay?

42:37.930 --> 42:39.610
- Is it all okay?
- It's all okay.

42:40.850 --> 42:42.320
Here.

42:42.520 --> 42:44.820
- To your health!
- And to yours!

42:47.940 --> 42:50.450
- Bye, Gennaro.
- Bye, Ciro.

42:57.950 --> 43:00.040
He's crazy about me!
