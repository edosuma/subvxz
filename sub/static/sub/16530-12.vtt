00:01.202 --> 00:01.335
.

00:06.374 --> 00:07.308
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:07.941 --> 00:08.942
sexually based offenses

00:08.976 --> 00:12.113
are considered
especially heinous.

00:12.146 --> 00:14.382
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.415 --> 00:16.284
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.317 --> 00:17.585
are members of an elite squad

00:17.618 --> 00:19.820
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.323
These are their stories.

00:23.591 --> 00:27.095
male announcer:
This is honor.

00:27.128 --> 00:30.498
This is service.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.601
This is courage.

00:33.634 --> 00:38.406
This is Captain Beth Williams.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.241
This is the United States
Army...

00:40.274 --> 00:43.244
[gunshot]
2.0.

00:45.446 --> 00:46.847
- What do you think, Captain?

00:46.880 --> 00:49.450
- I'm honored and humbled, sir.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.319
- Be humble on your own time.

00:51.352 --> 00:53.087
You're one of
the best soldiers we have.

00:53.121 --> 00:55.156
Silver Star,
first female Ranger,

00:55.189 --> 00:56.824
three confirmed kills.

00:56.857 --> 00:59.193
We didn't just pull
your name out of a hat.

00:59.227 --> 01:01.529
- Now it's time for the country
to hear your story.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.297
Once you're off leave,
I will escort you

01:03.331 --> 01:04.565
on a three-month media tour

01:04.598 --> 01:06.600
throughout this great nation
of ours.

01:06.634 --> 01:10.438
Lots of bright lights,
lots of cameras.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.306
This is your new mission.

01:16.877 --> 01:20.581
[indistinct chatter]

01:20.614 --> 01:21.582
- Beth.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.451
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:23.484 --> 01:28.156
- Hey.
Thank you so much for coming.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.457
- Hey, babe.

01:29.490 --> 01:30.624
- Hey.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.662
- So, uh,
have you two love birds

01:34.695 --> 01:36.197
set a date yet or what?

01:36.230 --> 01:38.199
- Next year, May 20th.
Right, baby?

01:38.232 --> 01:40.301
- Yeah.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.604
- Speech, speech,
speech, speech...

01:43.637 --> 01:47.175
[everyone chanting]
- No, no, no.

01:49.377 --> 01:53.113
- Hey!
[laughter, cheers]

01:54.948 --> 01:58.352
- People are always asking
what drives me.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.388
When thing's get tough,

02:00.421 --> 02:03.357
and I have to dig deep,

02:03.391 --> 02:06.427
where do I find my strength?

02:06.460 --> 02:08.362
It's here--

02:08.396 --> 02:10.498
my home,

02:10.531 --> 02:12.633
my family,

02:12.666 --> 02:14.235
my friends.

02:14.268 --> 02:16.237
You're my strength.

02:16.270 --> 02:18.706
Thank you
for always believing in me.

02:18.739 --> 02:21.542
- So here's champagne
for our real friends,

02:21.575 --> 02:23.744
and real pain
for our sham friends.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.179
[laughter]

02:25.213 --> 02:26.314
Let's drink!
- Yeah!

02:26.347 --> 02:27.715
- Hear! Hear!
- Cheers.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.183
[laughter]

02:29.217 --> 02:30.251
- Cheers.

02:37.425 --> 02:40.394
[tense music]

*

02:47.435 --> 02:50.471
[groaning]

02:51.439 --> 02:53.407
- Oh, my God.

02:53.441 --> 02:55.343
Are you okay?
- I'm good.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.545
- Don't move, you're hurt.
Let me help you.

02:57.578 --> 03:00.548
- [groans]

03:00.581 --> 03:03.484
- Yes, uh, I need an ambulance.

03:06.987 --> 03:09.457
- Fin, what do we got?

03:09.490 --> 03:11.259
- The vic's name
is Beth Williams.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.693
That jogger found her.

03:12.726 --> 03:15.363
She's in bad shape.
She can barely talk.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.664
- You said
she was sexually assaulted?

03:16.697 --> 03:18.366
- It looked that way.
Her skirt was torn,

03:18.399 --> 03:19.800
her underwear was pulled down.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.436
She had blunt force trauma
to the back of the head.

03:22.470 --> 03:24.405
- And what else
do we know about her?

03:24.438 --> 03:26.440
- UNI found her military ID.

03:26.474 --> 03:28.642
She's a captain
in the United States Army.

03:28.676 --> 03:31.545
- You're kidding me.
- I looked her up.

03:31.579 --> 03:34.548
She's a Ranger--
best of the best.

03:34.582 --> 03:35.716
That's why I called you, Liv.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.585
I thought you'd wanna be
early on this.

03:37.618 --> 03:40.321
- "Captain Beth Williams, 26.

03:40.354 --> 03:41.455
"Born and raised in Queens.

03:41.489 --> 03:44.325
"First woman to graduate
Ranger school.

03:44.358 --> 03:47.461
Three tours in Iraq.
Earned a Silver Star."

03:47.495 --> 03:49.263
So a local girl makes good,

03:49.297 --> 03:52.333
and this is
her "welcome home" present.

03:57.605 --> 04:00.574
[dramatic music]

04:43.484 --> 04:44.217
- So there's
our blunt force object.

04:45.252 --> 04:49.390
CSU's running it,
seeing if we can get any prints.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.559
- Hey, CSU found Beth's backpack
under a bush.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.994
Lookit what was inside.
50 C-notes.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.396
Hey, Fin,
when you were a Ranger,

04:55.429 --> 04:56.897
you ever walk around
with 5 grand?

04:56.930 --> 04:58.332
- More like $5.

04:58.366 --> 05:00.468
- So what? The perp just
leaves that behind?

05:00.501 --> 05:02.370
- Maybe that's not
what he was after.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.871
- Question is
why is she walking around

05:03.904 --> 05:04.972
with 5 Gs cash?

05:05.005 --> 05:06.407
- Yeah,
could be any number of reasons,

05:06.440 --> 05:08.075
but this neighborhood
kinda narrows it down.

05:08.108 --> 05:09.109
- Let's not jump to
any conclusions.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.879
Fin, why don't you coordinate
with the Army CID,

05:11.912 --> 05:13.947
and see if they know anything
that might be helpful.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.417
Carisi, get with Rollins
at the hospital.

05:16.450 --> 05:17.885
I'll meet you there.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.520
And let's find out
what Captain Williams was doing

05:19.553 --> 05:21.321
up here last night.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.594
Rollins, how's Beth doing?

05:26.627 --> 05:28.962
- She--she just got out of
Neuro-ICU.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.098
Uh, and they sutured up
her head wound.

05:31.131 --> 05:32.933
Sounds like she's doing okay.

05:32.966 --> 05:35.002
But they are gonna keep her here
under observation,

05:35.035 --> 05:35.869
until they can rule out
complications.

05:35.903 --> 05:36.937
- Okay, can we talk to her?
- Yeah.

05:36.970 --> 05:39.106
The doctor said yes,
as long as we keep it short.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.107
- I'm glad she's all right.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.141
Sounds like
he got pretty brutal.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.076
- Yeah, but she put up
a hell of a fight herself.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.578
She had several
offensive wounds--

05:44.612 --> 05:47.448
lots of cuts and scratches
on her knuckles.

05:47.481 --> 05:48.582
- Makes sense.
A woman like her

05:48.616 --> 05:50.017
is not gonna go down
without a fight.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.151
- And there's
some blood on her legs.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.052
Some of it could've come
from the perp.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.887
- Yeah, the guy gets cut
during the tussle.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.390
- Okay, so let's run it.
Maybe we'll get lucky.

05:56.424 --> 05:58.125
- Yeah, and, uh,
family's been contacted.

05:58.158 --> 06:00.093
The mom and the fiancé
are in the waiting room.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.962
- All right,
so you two talk to the family.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.030
I'll talk to Beth.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.134
- Did you see Beth last night?

06:07.167 --> 06:09.069
- Well, we had, uh,
a little party

06:09.102 --> 06:10.070
over at Mickey and George's

06:10.103 --> 06:13.006
to celebrate her graduation
from Ranger school.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.542
I left early,

06:14.575 --> 06:17.945
and--and Beth said
she'd be home later.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.680
When she didn't show up,
I just--

06:19.713 --> 06:23.517
you know, I just figured she--
she spent the night with Mickey.

06:23.551 --> 06:25.886
- Sylvia, um...

06:25.919 --> 06:29.056
we found a lot of cash
in Beth's backpack.

06:29.089 --> 06:31.124
It's $5,000.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.695
Do you know of any reason
why she'd be walking around

06:34.728 --> 06:38.098
with that kinda money?
- No. [sobs]

06:40.501 --> 06:43.003
- Beth?
- Yes, ma'am?

06:43.036 --> 06:47.107
- I'm Lieutenant Benson
from the Special Victims Unit.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.076
Are you feeling
well enough to talk?

06:52.713 --> 06:54.682
It's gonna be okay.

06:54.715 --> 06:55.983
I promise.

06:56.016 --> 06:59.052
- Thank you.
I...

07:01.154 --> 07:03.190
[sobs]
I appreciate that.

07:03.223 --> 07:07.194
- I know that this is tough,
but I'd like to ask you

07:07.227 --> 07:09.162
a few questions
about the assault,

07:09.196 --> 07:11.932
if that's okay.

07:11.965 --> 07:12.933
- Okay.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.568
- Do you know
who did this to you?

07:14.602 --> 07:17.938
- I can't believe
this really happened.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.607
The timing is--

07:22.576 --> 07:24.478
This is the last thing
I need right now.

07:24.512 --> 07:29.116
- What do you mean?
- I'm starting a press tour...

07:29.149 --> 07:31.519
next week for the Army.

07:31.552 --> 07:36.023
The goal is to project
strength, courage, power.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.659
I can't be in here

07:38.692 --> 07:41.028
talking about getting raped,
for God's sake.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.596
- First of all, Beth,

07:42.630 --> 07:46.233
nothing has changed.

07:46.266 --> 07:50.003
You're the same person
that you were before this--

07:50.037 --> 07:54.575
the same strong person.

07:54.608 --> 07:57.077
Do you think you can tell me
what happened?

08:00.848 --> 08:02.783
Do you know who did this to you?

08:08.088 --> 08:10.791
- I wanna talk to Major Dantley.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.560
He's my superior officer.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.662
- Okay, I understand that.

08:14.695 --> 08:17.598
But the more you can tell me,
the more helpful I can be.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.299
[door opens]

08:19.332 --> 08:20.367
- Excuse me, Lieutenant,

08:20.400 --> 08:23.136
we need to take Ms. Williams
upstairs for more tests.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.738
- If you could just give me
two more minutes.

08:24.772 --> 08:25.939
- We need to do this quick.

08:25.973 --> 08:29.610
I've already discussed all this
with the other detective.

08:29.643 --> 08:32.646
- I'm okay.
I can walk.

08:38.786 --> 08:40.821
- You got any news on Beth?
- Yeah, she's stable.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.790
They're still running tests,
but the doctors are hopeful.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.825
- She called me when
she got here--told me to come.

08:44.858 --> 08:45.859
She said
she can't remember anything?

08:45.893 --> 08:48.028
- With her type of injury,
that--that's common.

08:48.061 --> 08:50.631
You just gotta
give this time, Mickey, okay?

08:50.664 --> 08:51.732
Listen, I'm gonna
have to ask you guys

08:51.765 --> 08:54.201
some questions now, okay?

08:54.234 --> 08:57.204
All right, so this--this party--
what time did Beth leave?

08:57.237 --> 08:59.640
- Around 11:00.
You know, I asked her to stay,

08:59.673 --> 09:01.141
but she wanted to be
with her mom.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.743
- And you didn't offer
to walk her home?

09:02.776 --> 09:04.845
- She didn't want me leaving
the party on her account.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.214
- Beth's pretty independent.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.149
- Does Beth usually
carry lots of cash?

09:09.182 --> 09:11.785
- Cash? No, I--
she's in the Army.

09:11.819 --> 09:13.721
- Well, we found $5,000
in her backpack.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.355
Any idea where that came from?

09:15.388 --> 09:17.057
- No clue.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.859
- What did you two guys do
after the party?

09:18.892 --> 09:22.195
- Well,
we stayed up playing Xbox.

09:22.229 --> 09:25.332
I asked Beth to stay--
you know, hang out.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.737
We shouldn't have
let her leave alone.

09:31.371 --> 09:32.372
- Listen, uh, George,

09:32.405 --> 09:33.807
why don't you give
me and Mickey a few minutes.

09:33.841 --> 09:35.709
All right?
Thanks.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.146
Hey, listen, Mickey,
I'm gonna have to talk to you

09:39.179 --> 09:41.248
about some
pretty personal stuff now.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.684
It's standard procedure.
- Yeah, sure, no problem.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.853
- Did you and Beth have sex
in the past 48 hours?

09:45.886 --> 09:47.354
- Um, yeah.

09:47.387 --> 09:50.223
I mean, we haven't seen
each other in five months, so...

09:50.257 --> 09:51.759
- Okay, did you use a condom?

09:51.792 --> 09:55.796
- No, um...
Beth's on the pill, so...

09:55.829 --> 09:58.365
- Okay, I'm gonna--
I'm gonna have to swab you now.

09:58.398 --> 10:01.368
- Um, yeah.

10:01.401 --> 10:04.638
- They're calling her
the face of Army 2.0,

10:04.672 --> 10:07.808
Captain Beth Williams,
the first woman to graduate

10:07.841 --> 10:10.644
from the rigorous Ranger
training program

10:10.678 --> 10:13.146
is set to embark
on a publicity tour

10:13.180 --> 10:17.384
showcasing the Army's new
and more progressive attitude.

10:17.417 --> 10:21.254
The hope is that the Captain
Williams marketing campaign

10:21.288 --> 10:24.224
will help with the current
recruiting efforts.

10:24.257 --> 10:27.127
Now, Captain Williams was kept
to the same standards

10:27.160 --> 10:30.297
as the men, that's thanks to
the Army's new

10:30.330 --> 10:32.833
gender-integrated assessment
program

10:32.866 --> 10:36.937
which guarantees parity,
regardless of gender.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.839
- She's as strong as
any of the male Rangers.

10:38.872 --> 10:41.809
- Impressive.
- Everybody's not impressed.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.777
Found this hater online.

10:43.811 --> 10:46.413
He's one of those
Men's Rights Movement guys.

10:46.446 --> 10:48.849
Check out those posts.
- "Captain Beth Williams

10:48.882 --> 10:50.751
"might as well be
Captain Crunch.

10:50.784 --> 10:51.985
Army ain't what it used to be.
Hoo-ah."

10:52.019 --> 10:53.420
- "I think I saw
Captain Hot Pants

10:53.453 --> 10:54.454
"waiting for the N train today.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.357
"Next time, I'll do a service
for the country,

10:57.390 --> 10:58.992
and push her onto the tracks."
- Yeah.

10:59.026 --> 11:02.429
- The N train sounds local.
- Calls himself "Superman78."

11:02.462 --> 11:04.898
- Okay, so some loser who lives
in his parents' basement

11:04.932 --> 11:07.300
hates women.
- Okay, but he made a threat.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.203
So this is the closest thing
we have to a lead,

11:10.237 --> 11:12.305
so let's track down
Superman for real,

11:12.339 --> 11:13.807
and find out
where he was last night.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.175
- I'll call Barba--
see if I can get a warrant

11:15.208 --> 11:16.309
for the RedChanIt server--

11:16.343 --> 11:18.445
see if we can get
this guy's real name.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.447
- Sergeant.

11:20.480 --> 11:23.450
- Who's that guy?
- That's Major Robert Dantley.

11:23.483 --> 11:24.885
Captain Williams has been
serving under him

11:24.918 --> 11:25.853
for the past two years

11:25.886 --> 11:27.988
he'll be traveling around
the country with her

11:28.021 --> 11:29.322
on her press tour.

11:31.491 --> 11:34.928
- Detective Tutuola got in touch
with me about Captain Williams.

11:34.962 --> 11:36.129
Horrible.
- Yeah.

11:36.163 --> 11:38.298
- Anything you need, please know
you have our full support.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.968
- Oh, thank you, Major.
I appreciate that.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.402
- As I'm sure
you can understand,

11:42.435 --> 11:43.370
it's in everyone's best interest

11:43.403 --> 11:45.939
if this tragic event
remains confidential.

11:45.973 --> 11:48.375
Last thing we want--last thing
Captain Williams wants--

11:48.408 --> 11:51.278
is for this unfortunate event
to be played out in the press.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.814
- Well, I think
we can both agree

11:53.847 --> 11:54.982
that our primary concern

11:55.015 --> 11:56.817
is what's best
for Captain Williams.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.519
- Terrific.
So she'll be a Jane Doe?

11:59.552 --> 12:01.822
- Well, if that's
what she wants.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.456
Ultimately it's her decision.

12:03.490 --> 12:07.060
You know, some survivors
prefer to go public.

12:07.094 --> 12:09.062
It encourages other women
to come forward.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.331
- Of course.

12:11.364 --> 12:14.367
- So, Major, um,
do you have any idea

12:14.401 --> 12:16.770
what Captain Williams was doing
at 207th street

12:16.804 --> 12:19.072
at 4:00 in the morning?
- No, ma'am.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.875
- Were you aware of any issues,
or any problems?

12:21.909 --> 12:23.811
- No, ma'am.
[knocking on door]

12:23.844 --> 12:25.445
- Excuse me, Lieutenant, a word?

12:25.478 --> 12:26.980
- Excuse me, Major.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.519
- Rape kit came back.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.087
The semen DNA's a match
for Mickey Reid,

12:34.121 --> 12:35.455
her fiancé, as to be expected.

12:35.488 --> 12:36.990
- So the perp wore a condom?
- Maybe.

12:37.024 --> 12:38.558
We didn't find
any traces of lubricant.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.260
I'm guessing
the guy didn't finish.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.528
The good news is that
the lab did find

12:41.561 --> 12:43.330
somebody else's blood
on Beth's skin.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.432
- He in the system?
- Ah, he's all over it.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.300
Jose Marquez, 35.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.069
He's got a rap sheet
from here to Yonkers,

12:49.102 --> 12:51.038
including felony assault.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.076
- Excuse me, guys,

12:56.109 --> 12:59.046
looking for Jose Marquez.
Heh?

12:59.079 --> 13:01.014
You guys, Jose Marquez?

13:01.048 --> 13:02.916
- That's me.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.584
Do me a favor--
move the Bobcat, all right?

13:04.617 --> 13:07.354
- Yeah, we got a few questions
about where you were last night.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.022
- I'm a little busy right now.
Can this wait?

13:09.056 --> 13:10.924
- No, it can't.

13:15.062 --> 13:17.130
Why don't you start with
what happened to your eye.

13:17.164 --> 13:18.932
- I got in a fight.

13:18.966 --> 13:21.001
- With Beth Williams?

13:21.034 --> 13:23.103
- Yeah, you could say that.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.405
Why are you asking?
- Well, she was assaulted.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.908
- Yeah, and your blood
was found on her legs, Jose.

13:27.941 --> 13:30.577
- Yeah, well,
that makes sense.

13:30.610 --> 13:33.380
- How's that?
- Check this video out.

13:36.516 --> 13:39.119
[cheering]

13:39.152 --> 13:42.990
[indistinct cheers
and applause]

13:43.023 --> 13:44.491
- Is that what I think it is?

13:44.524 --> 13:46.093
- Yeah.

13:46.126 --> 13:47.995
It's a fight club, man.

13:48.028 --> 13:51.064
[cheering]

14:03.576 --> 14:06.179
[all chanting]
Beth! Beth! Beth! Beth!

14:14.354 --> 14:15.488
- I already told you, people.
I didn't rape Beth Williams.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.358
Hell, I couldn't even
get a jab in there.

14:18.391 --> 14:19.426
I was just trying to get my--
- You know what, hold up,

14:19.459 --> 14:21.394
where was this fight?
- [sighs]

14:21.428 --> 14:23.663
It's always at the warehouse
on 203rd street.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.133
- That's four blocks from
where Beth was assaulted, Jose.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.034
- What's that supposed to mean?

14:27.067 --> 14:28.668
- It means you might have
a fragile ego.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.637
You don't like getting
your ass kicked by a woman.

14:30.670 --> 14:32.305
- Oh, come on, man.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.174
Home girl kicked my ass
fair and square.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.376
I got nothing but
mad respect for her.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.578
- Listen, does anybody
ever bet on these fights?

14:38.611 --> 14:41.248
- Yeah, everyone.
- What about the fighters?

14:41.281 --> 14:43.150
- There's a purse--
$5,000.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.452
Winner take all--
all cash.

14:45.485 --> 14:48.155
- And when did you leave?
- Right after the fight.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.256
It was 3:30 in the morning.

14:49.289 --> 14:50.457
My wife took me
to see the doctor,

14:50.490 --> 14:52.459
so I could get these.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.127
I'm not your guy.
- I'd like to believe

14:54.161 --> 14:55.562
everything you said,
but I don't.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.697
- [sighs]

14:57.730 --> 15:00.267
Look, I'm no angel,

15:00.300 --> 15:03.336
but this particular thing--
I'm clean.

15:03.370 --> 15:06.339
She gave me a beat down, and
that's the last time I saw her.

15:12.312 --> 15:13.713
- Hey.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.382
Doctor says
you're feeling better.

15:15.415 --> 15:18.285
- I am. Thank you.
- Good.

15:18.318 --> 15:19.352
So Beth...

15:19.386 --> 15:23.190
- I prefer
Captain Williams, ma'am.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.625
- Oh, okay.

15:25.658 --> 15:28.128
Okay. Captain Williams.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.163
Whatever you prefer.

15:34.601 --> 15:38.638
So, Captain Williams...

15:38.671 --> 15:41.608
were you able to remember
any of the details, or--

15:41.641 --> 15:43.210
- No.

15:43.243 --> 15:44.644
I tried,
but it's still a bit foggy.

15:44.677 --> 15:45.512
- That's all right.

15:45.545 --> 15:48.181
So how 'bout we start
at the beginning,

15:48.215 --> 15:49.749
and we'll just
take it from there.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.119
You were at the party

15:52.152 --> 15:54.387
earlier that evening
at your fiancé's apartment.

15:54.421 --> 15:55.555
- Yes.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.590
- Okay, and where'd you go
after that?

16:01.194 --> 16:03.730
Do you remember
being at the fight club?

16:05.798 --> 16:09.269
It's okay, Captain.
I am not here to judge you.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.403
I promise you that.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.705
- I appreciate that, ma'am.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.441
And you are correct.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.510
I participated in a mixed
martial arts event that evening.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.712
I needed to make
some quick money.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.614
My mom has early Parkinson's,

16:21.648 --> 16:23.283
and there's
an experimental drug she needs

16:23.316 --> 16:24.751
that isn't covered by insurance.

16:24.784 --> 16:27.420
- All right, so did--

16:27.454 --> 16:29.289
did any of the men
come onto you?

16:29.322 --> 16:31.158
Were they disrespectful?

16:31.191 --> 16:33.293
- No one came onto me.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.428
- Okay.
So, um,

16:35.462 --> 16:37.664
how did you find out
about the fight club?

16:37.697 --> 16:40.233
- My old martial arts coach
runs it.

16:40.267 --> 16:42.569
- Uh-huh.
And what time did you leave?

16:42.602 --> 16:45.538
- 4:26.
I checked my watch.

16:45.572 --> 16:48.575
- Were you with anyone?
- No, I was alone.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.443
- Did you see anyone
following you?

16:50.477 --> 16:53.546
- No, I obviously
let my guard down.

16:53.580 --> 16:57.217
- No,
you didn't do anything wrong.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.618
This--this isn't on you.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.453
- I respectfully
disagree, ma'am.

17:00.487 --> 17:02.689
As a Ranger, I'm taught
to stay mentally alert,

17:02.722 --> 17:05.325
physically strong,
and morally straight.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.593
Under no circumstances,

17:06.626 --> 17:09.329
will I ever embarrass
my country.

17:09.362 --> 17:13.266
- A predator raped
and assaulted you.

17:13.300 --> 17:17.270
Embarrassment doesn't even
enter the conversation.

17:17.304 --> 17:19.639
- I suppose we see things
differently.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.379
- Okay.

17:28.748 --> 17:30.517
Thank you.

17:41.694 --> 17:44.731
You know, I know
that this is, uh,

17:44.764 --> 17:48.368
difficult, Captain.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.802
And I just want to assure you

17:49.836 --> 17:54.774
that I will do
everything in my power

17:54.807 --> 17:57.577
to find the person
who's responsible for this.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.383
- And what do I do, Lieutenant?

18:05.818 --> 18:08.388
What's my mission?

18:10.557 --> 18:12.525
- To heal.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.537
- Jose Marquez's
alibi checks out.

18:24.571 --> 18:27.874
He was at a 24-hour
walk-in clinic called CityMed.

18:27.907 --> 18:29.776
He has a fractured rib too.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.778
- Huh, she really did a number
on that dude.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.713
- And then a couple hours later,
she gets beat down.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.682
How does that happen?
- Here's what we do know.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.350
Captain Williams was assaulted

18:37.384 --> 18:39.552
four blocks from
where she fought Jose.

18:39.586 --> 18:40.787
- So we think that
somebody followed her

18:40.820 --> 18:42.722
from the fight club?
- Well, it was a room

18:42.755 --> 18:45.525
full of drunk, amped-up men,

18:45.558 --> 18:47.560
so, I mean,
it's certainly possible.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.762
I think that we should talk to
her martial arts coach.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.564
He's the one
who organizes these things.

18:51.598 --> 18:54.367
And get the name of every person
who was in that room.

18:57.737 --> 18:59.639
- I still can't believe
what happened.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.308
Beth's a fierce warrior.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.810
- You two are close?
- I've been training Beth

19:03.843 --> 19:05.578
since she was in
the eighth grade.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.414
- Did any man
pay special attention to her

19:07.447 --> 19:10.483
the night of the fight?
- Well, to be honest,

19:10.517 --> 19:12.485
having Beth on our card
was a huge draw,

19:12.519 --> 19:14.954
but it's not sexual in any way.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.490
People came to see
two skilled fighters face off.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.426
We take it seriously.
- I'm sure you do.

19:19.459 --> 19:21.461
What time did you leave?
- I didn't.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.729
I have a loft
in the same building

19:22.762 --> 19:24.597
where I hold the fights.
Slept there.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.466
My girlfriend was with me
all night.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.867
- Okay, we're gonna
need to talk to her too.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.470
- We also need the names of
everybody who was there.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.372
- Is that really necessary?
I mean, I--

19:32.405 --> 19:33.973
I don't wanna betray
anyone's privacy.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.676
- This is a rape investigation,
Randy.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.445
We're beyond privacy.

19:40.647 --> 19:43.383
- And suspect number 20
bites the dust.

19:43.416 --> 19:44.751
Tom Metz let the club
at 2:00 a.m.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.719
He got an E-ZPass hit
half an hour later

19:46.753 --> 19:47.787
on his way home to Stamford.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.856
- Well, it's hard to assault
somebody in New York

19:49.889 --> 19:51.691
when you're in Connecticut.
- [chuckles] Yeah.

19:51.724 --> 19:54.861
So that leaves what?
27 more angry idiots,

19:54.894 --> 19:56.663
who like to bet on
inter-gender fist fighting

19:56.696 --> 19:58.931
at 4:00 in the morning?
- Okay, our friends at RedChanIt

19:58.965 --> 19:59.899
finally got back to us.

19:59.932 --> 20:02.502
We got a real name
for this online troll--

20:02.535 --> 20:05.972
"Superman78."
His name is Gary Cook.

20:06.005 --> 20:08.441
- Gary Cook.
Gary Cook.

20:08.475 --> 20:10.910
He's on our list.
- Yeah, got him right here.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.846
He's an Army vet--
dishonorably discharged.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.648
He has three drug convictions,

20:15.682 --> 20:18.518
and in his spare time, he works
as a freelance I.T. guy.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.853
- Yeah, when he's not
trolling Beth online.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.755
Check out what he posted today.

20:22.789 --> 20:25.392
- "I saw our Rangerette give
quite a show the other night.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.660
I wonder if she screws
as good as she fights."

20:27.694 --> 20:29.462
- Bring him in.
"Superman78"--

20:29.496 --> 20:32.832
let's see how tough
our Man of Steel really is.

20:46.479 --> 20:47.680
- How's it going?
- Gary Cook?

20:47.714 --> 20:49.482
NYPD--
Detective Rollins--

20:49.516 --> 20:51.551
talk to you for a sec.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.954
- About what?
- Captain Beth Williams.

20:54.987 --> 20:57.524
- Hm.

20:57.557 --> 20:58.758
- Carisi!

21:01.894 --> 21:04.431
Stay down!
- Get away from me, bitch!

21:04.464 --> 21:05.665
- Hands behind your back!
- Stop resisting!

21:05.698 --> 21:07.534
Stop resisting!

21:07.567 --> 21:08.801
- [grunts]
[groaning]

21:08.835 --> 21:09.969
- [grunts]

21:10.002 --> 21:11.704
- [groans]

21:11.738 --> 21:14.574
- Where's the fire, Gary? Huh?

21:14.607 --> 21:15.808
- [groans]

21:24.617 --> 21:25.585
- When's the last time
you saw Captain Williams?

21:26.419 --> 21:28.555
- After the fight,
I was having a smoke--

21:28.588 --> 21:29.789
saw her leaving.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.324
- Did you follow her?
- For a little.

21:31.358 --> 21:33.025
- Okay, so now
we're getting somewhere.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.894
I mean,
this is confusing, right?

21:34.927 --> 21:37.096
She's hot,
but she's full of herself.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.164
She's strong, she's tough,

21:38.197 --> 21:40.099
so you gotta show her
what a real man can do, right?

21:40.132 --> 21:43.470
- Did you hit her, Gary?
With a rock maybe?

21:43.503 --> 21:47.507
- I hit her with a firm
and respectful handshake.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.476
- A handshake?
This is the woman you called--

21:49.509 --> 21:51.878
and I--I quote--
"an Army publicity stunt

21:51.911 --> 21:54.013
with a nice rack."

21:54.046 --> 21:56.883
- What pill do you take?
The bright blue,

21:56.916 --> 21:59.452
politically correct pill,
like the rest of the sheep?

21:59.486 --> 22:02.021
Or are you red pill thinkers?

22:02.054 --> 22:04.791
- Well, what's in the red pill?
- Truth.

22:04.824 --> 22:07.093
And the truth is
I cherish women.

22:07.126 --> 22:09.829
The entire manosphere does so.
- Manosphere?

22:09.862 --> 22:12.899
- If you would chew on
this red pill for a moment,

22:12.932 --> 22:15.568
perhaps its not a great idea

22:15.602 --> 22:19.038
for a woman to be boxing a man

22:19.071 --> 22:21.908
at 4:00 in the morning
in a warehouse.

22:21.941 --> 22:26.045
Maybe God put women here
for nobler purposes.

22:26.078 --> 22:28.080
- Right, nobler purposes,
like making babies?

22:28.114 --> 22:28.948
Cooking? Cleaning?

22:28.981 --> 22:32.419
- Worked for
the last thousand years.

22:32.452 --> 22:35.788
- What happened after
this wonderful handshake, Gary?

22:35.822 --> 22:38.558
- I said, "Good fight."

22:38.591 --> 22:40.059
She walked away,

22:40.092 --> 22:43.830
then I hopped into a cab
to go see my grandma.

22:43.863 --> 22:46.533
- Grandma?
Is this guy real?

22:46.566 --> 22:47.900
- Look,
he's not helping himself,

22:47.934 --> 22:51.404
but there's no DNA match.
There's no witnesses.

22:51.438 --> 22:53.105
- How's Captain Williams doing?

22:53.139 --> 22:54.407
- Well, she's coming around,

22:54.441 --> 22:56.042
but this is
really tough for her.

22:56.075 --> 22:57.577
I mean, we don't see
a lot of victims

22:57.610 --> 22:59.512
that are decorated war heroes.

22:59.546 --> 23:01.548
- Yeah, she's used to
being the aggressor.

23:01.581 --> 23:04.183
That's part of our creed.
Rangers lead the way.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.585
- That's why
she's really struggling.

23:05.618 --> 23:07.420
- Think she can ID this guy?

23:07.454 --> 23:09.088
- She says that
her memory's still foggy,

23:09.121 --> 23:10.857
but maybe if
we show her a picture

23:10.890 --> 23:14.861
of this Renaissance man,
that'll clarify things.

23:21.534 --> 23:23.970
Captain Williams...
- Hi, wasn't expecting you.

23:24.003 --> 23:25.505
- Uh, where are you going?

23:25.538 --> 23:27.206
- To my mom's house.
- Did your doctor release you?

23:27.239 --> 23:28.475
- [chuckles]
Following my own orders.

23:28.508 --> 23:31.511
- Captain, uh,
it's just been 24 hours.

23:31.544 --> 23:33.980
Your--your body
needs time to recover.

23:34.013 --> 23:36.082
They--they still have to
do tests on your head.

23:36.115 --> 23:37.617
- Thank you, ma'am,

23:37.650 --> 23:39.185
but I'm quite in tune
with my body.

23:39.218 --> 23:40.987
- Okay, uh,

23:41.020 --> 23:43.055
we--we'd like to talk to you
in private for a moment--

23:43.089 --> 23:46.493
if that's okay. I have a-a photo
that I'd like to show you.

23:52.164 --> 23:54.100
- Him.

23:54.133 --> 23:56.636
- You sure?
- He definitely looks familiar.

23:56.669 --> 23:59.672
I remember that he was smoking
a cigarette outside the fight.

23:59.706 --> 24:02.208
And I've seen him creeping
around my gym a few times.

24:02.241 --> 24:05.144
- Okay, so what about
the actual assault?

24:05.177 --> 24:08.681
You remember seeing
this man's face?

24:08.715 --> 24:09.982
- Yes.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.653
- Okay.
So Captain, can you--

24:13.686 --> 24:16.489
can you walk us through
all of this?

24:16.523 --> 24:18.525
Right? The fight ends,

24:18.558 --> 24:20.693
and then you saw this man
smoking a cigarette.

24:20.727 --> 24:23.696
- Yeah, he followed me
down the block,

24:23.730 --> 24:27.133
then I finally turned around
and confronted him.

24:27.166 --> 24:30.670
Then I--I shoved him,
and told him to back off.

24:30.703 --> 24:33.172
- Did he?
- I thought he did.

24:33.205 --> 24:35.207
He walked away.

24:35.241 --> 24:38.177
So I kept walking
towards the subway.

24:38.210 --> 24:41.514
Then I heard footsteps.

24:41.548 --> 24:43.149
I turned...

24:45.184 --> 24:48.187
It was him.
- You're sure?

24:48.220 --> 24:50.089
- Yes, ma'am.

24:53.125 --> 24:54.661
- Okay.

24:54.694 --> 24:56.529
We'll bring him in.

24:57.664 --> 25:00.066
- Captain Williams.

25:00.099 --> 25:03.936
I know how tough you are.
I was a Ranger also.

25:03.970 --> 25:06.639
- Sua sponte.
- Back at you.

25:06.673 --> 25:07.940
But like we both know,

25:07.974 --> 25:10.209
every soldier needs
a little R&R.

25:10.242 --> 25:11.544
Why don't you stay another day?

25:11.578 --> 25:13.312
Read a book, watch TV.
It can't hurt.

25:13.345 --> 25:16.683
- Thank you,
but my mom needs me.

25:16.716 --> 25:18.651
And with all due respect,
hanging out in a hospital

25:18.685 --> 25:20.519
isn't my idea of R&R.

25:27.727 --> 25:30.663
- She's hardcore.
- Yeah, agreed.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.565
You don't think it's odd
that she didn't ask us

25:32.599 --> 25:36.135
more about Cook?
She didn't even ask us his name.

25:36.168 --> 25:38.971
She didn't even ask if
we were going to arrest him.

25:39.005 --> 25:41.007
- Well, see, if she asks
about her assailant,

25:41.040 --> 25:43.009
she's admitting
she let it happen.

25:48.114 --> 25:50.983
- So Captain Williams ID'd
Gary Cook.

25:51.017 --> 25:53.085
Let's charge him.
- Loved to, trust me,

25:53.119 --> 25:53.986
but we got a problem.

25:54.020 --> 25:56.188
- Two problems actually.
Both are big.

25:56.222 --> 25:57.824
- Awesome.
Who wants to go first?

25:57.857 --> 26:01.127
- Well, turns out that
Gary Cook's grandma

26:01.160 --> 26:03.596
lives at the St. James
Assisted Living Facility.

26:03.630 --> 26:05.765
And I--I talked to two witnesses
that put him there.

26:05.798 --> 26:08.267
They have a sign-in sheet.
- His grandma? You're kidding.

26:08.300 --> 26:12.104
- No.
And look at the sign-in time.

26:12.138 --> 26:14.273
- 4:50 a.m.
So where is this?

26:14.306 --> 26:16.108
- It's in Yonkers.
It's at the--

26:16.142 --> 26:18.310
the corner of Ashburton Avenue
and North Broadway.

26:18.344 --> 26:20.279
- So Captain Williams
was assaulted

26:20.312 --> 26:22.148
between 4:30 and 5:00.

26:22.181 --> 26:23.850
- At 207th Street.

26:23.883 --> 26:25.818
- It takes 20 minutes to get to
that part of Yonkers

26:25.852 --> 26:27.186
in a car or train.

26:27.219 --> 26:28.855
- What's the other problem?
- This.

26:28.888 --> 26:31.290
- This is surveillance footage
from an auto glass shop

26:31.323 --> 26:33.192
on 203rd Street
the night of the assault.

26:33.225 --> 26:34.226
Now there's Beth--all right.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.028
She's walking out of
the fight club warehouse.

26:36.062 --> 26:37.363
- Right, and there's
Gary Cook coming in.

26:37.396 --> 26:39.165
- Right, right, right,
and he starts to follow her.

26:39.198 --> 26:41.868
- Right, which syncs up with
Captain Williams' story.

26:43.202 --> 26:45.271
Okay, she's about to
shove him, right?

26:45.304 --> 26:47.674
- No.
Not exactly.

26:51.811 --> 26:53.846
He shakes her hand.
He walks the other way,

26:53.880 --> 26:55.381
just like he said.

26:58.751 --> 27:01.087
- Cook's telling the truth.

27:19.005 --> 27:19.138
.

27:19.171 --> 27:19.672
- Ready?
- Excuse me.

27:21.273 --> 27:25.144
- Captain Williams.
- Hey.

27:25.177 --> 27:26.679
We're late
getting in the hospital

27:26.713 --> 27:28.147
for my mom's treatment.
- I'm so sorry.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.148
It's--it's important.

27:29.181 --> 27:32.151
- What do you need?
- It's about Gary Cook,

27:32.184 --> 27:34.053
uh, the man that
you identified.

27:34.086 --> 27:36.088
Look, I--I know that
this is very difficult,

27:36.122 --> 27:38.224
and--and I just wanna help.

27:38.257 --> 27:40.426
You understand that, right?
- Of course.

27:40.459 --> 27:42.762
- Okay, so I just wanted to--

27:42.795 --> 27:44.831
to make sure that you were clear

27:44.864 --> 27:47.800
about--about what you saw,
about what you remember.

27:47.834 --> 27:50.236
So if you could just quickly
think back to that night.

27:50.269 --> 27:53.239
Are you sure that Gary Cook
is the man that attacked you?

27:53.272 --> 27:54.807
- Yes.

27:56.075 --> 27:58.444
- So here's where
we're having the problem.

27:58.477 --> 28:03.015
Two of my detectives
found ironclad witnesses,

28:03.049 --> 28:07.486
who put Gary Cook 50 blocks
from where you were that night.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.055
So you understand
what I'm saying.

28:09.088 --> 28:13.092
He--he can't be the guy.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.227
- I must've made a mistake.

28:15.261 --> 28:18.765
- Okay, please--wait--
Captain Williams, look,

28:18.798 --> 28:21.868
I'm just trying to
figure this out with you, okay?

28:21.901 --> 28:23.035
- I've been called back to base.

28:23.069 --> 28:24.904
I fly out tonight
with Major Dantley.

28:24.937 --> 28:26.038
- Tonight?

28:26.072 --> 28:28.074
I thought you were staying
two weeks for your mother?

28:28.107 --> 28:31.911
- Duty calls.
- How 'bout you stay a few days?

28:31.944 --> 28:33.312
Give yourself a chance to heal.

28:33.345 --> 28:35.815
Give us a chance
to find your assailant

28:35.848 --> 28:37.249
and put him behind bars.

28:37.283 --> 28:40.753
And--and in my experience,

28:40.787 --> 28:42.855
that will help you find closure.

28:42.889 --> 28:44.924
- Soldiers don't need closure,
Lieutenant.

28:44.957 --> 28:46.926
Soldiers need a mission.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.735
[engine turns over,
car starts]

28:59.238 --> 29:02.241
- We're in the middle of
an active investigation,

29:02.274 --> 29:05.177
Captain Williams
was brutally assaulted

29:05.211 --> 29:07.313
three days ago.

29:07.346 --> 29:09.315
And we need her help.

29:09.348 --> 29:11.918
You can't just keep her here
a few more days?

29:11.951 --> 29:13.920
- I got a chain in command,
just like you.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.988
Army feels it's best for her
to get back with us.

29:16.022 --> 29:17.256
- I get that, sir,

29:17.289 --> 29:19.558
but she has
an important mission here--

29:19.591 --> 29:21.260
helping us find the punk
that hurt her.

29:21.293 --> 29:23.796
- I'm just as worried about
Captain Williams as you are.

29:23.830 --> 29:25.297
Hell, I'm a lot more worried.

29:25.331 --> 29:27.133
We've known each other
for five years.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.802
She's one of my soldiers--
a fellow Ranger.

29:29.836 --> 29:30.870
But she needs to
get back to base.

29:30.903 --> 29:34.140
- With all due respect,
this isn't just about her.

29:34.173 --> 29:36.575
It's about
other potential victims.

29:36.608 --> 29:40.146
While this guy is free,
he is a threat to other women.

29:40.179 --> 29:42.281
- I appreciate that, Lieutenant,

29:42.314 --> 29:44.283
but I need soldiers who are
engaged in the present,

29:44.316 --> 29:46.152
and the longer
Captain Williams stays here,

29:46.185 --> 29:48.888
stuck in the mire of
this unresolved tragedy,

29:48.921 --> 29:50.556
the worse it is for all of us.

29:50.589 --> 29:52.024
- And the more likely it is

29:52.058 --> 29:53.826
the press gets wind
of what happened.

29:53.860 --> 29:57.029
Is that it?
- No, that's not it.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.934
I've known Beth since
she was in her slick sleeves--

30:01.968 --> 30:04.937
watched her evolve as a person,
and as a soldier.

30:04.971 --> 30:06.873
And I'm getting her back to
where the hell she belongs,

30:06.906 --> 30:10.877
but make no mistake,
I'm on her side.

30:10.910 --> 30:13.880
Trust me on that.
- I do.

30:13.913 --> 30:16.115
I just hope your approach works.

30:19.919 --> 30:21.153
- Okay, so the subway stop

30:21.187 --> 30:22.321
Beth was headed to
is right down there.

30:22.354 --> 30:23.990
- Closest bar--
right near the park.

30:24.023 --> 30:26.292
- Only place around here
opened late night too.

30:26.325 --> 30:27.426
After you.

30:27.459 --> 30:29.862
- Ugh!

30:29.896 --> 30:31.330
- There you go.

30:31.363 --> 30:34.333
All the receipts from
the night of January 8th.

30:34.366 --> 30:36.068
Your people already
went through 'em.

30:36.102 --> 30:37.203
- Yeah, well, we're gonna
check their homework.

30:37.236 --> 30:38.637
- That's a lot of receipts
for one night.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.072
Big business, huh?

30:40.106 --> 30:42.008
- Karaoke night.
- Right.

30:42.041 --> 30:45.077
Did you happen to see
this girl walking by that night?

30:45.111 --> 30:47.313
Maybe somebody following her?

30:47.346 --> 30:50.149
- That'd be a no,
and another no.

30:55.988 --> 30:57.389
- Okay, so these are
all the people

30:57.423 --> 31:00.927
who were here closing.
I say we divide and conquer.

31:02.929 --> 31:04.463
- Or we talk to this guy.

31:04.496 --> 31:06.332
- Michael Reid...

31:06.365 --> 31:08.100
Is this Mickey?
- Yeah.

31:08.134 --> 31:09.936
It's the fiancé,
and check out the time.

31:09.969 --> 31:12.371
- 4:25 a.m.
That's right around the time

31:12.404 --> 31:14.006
Beth was assaulted
a block from here.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.108
Son of a bitch lied to us.

31:22.414 --> 31:25.284
Mickey Reid!
NYPD!

31:26.452 --> 31:28.087
- Hey, what's going on?
- Where's Mickey?

31:28.120 --> 31:29.255
- Uh, I don't know.
- You don't know?

31:29.288 --> 31:30.456
Or is that what Mickey
told you to say?

31:30.489 --> 31:33.059
- Step aside.
- He's not here--I swear.

31:33.092 --> 31:34.393
- Oh, you swear, huh?
Just like you swear

31:34.426 --> 31:35.995
you were playing
video games with Mickey

31:36.028 --> 31:38.397
the night Beth was raped?
- I was!

31:38.430 --> 31:40.366
- You ever heard of
obstruction of justice?

31:40.399 --> 31:42.201
- All right, we're clear.
You know, we know

31:42.234 --> 31:43.970
that Mickey was not here
with you that night.

31:44.003 --> 31:45.972
We know that.
- George...

31:46.005 --> 31:48.074
you were just looking out
for your friend, and I get that,

31:48.107 --> 31:50.977
but now it's time for you
to look out for yourself.

31:51.010 --> 31:52.378
- [sighs]

31:52.411 --> 31:55.381
The morning after it happened,
Mickey called--

31:55.414 --> 31:57.416
asked me to cover for him.

31:57.449 --> 32:00.286
He said he was out
drinking alone all night,

32:00.319 --> 32:02.021
and it might look bad.
- Why would it look bad?

32:02.054 --> 32:03.389
They're happily engaged.

32:03.422 --> 32:07.026
- Actually, Beth broke it off
after the party.

32:07.059 --> 32:09.161
That's why she walked
home alone.

32:09.195 --> 32:11.263
Mickey was crushed.

32:11.297 --> 32:13.465
Told her to get out.
- Really?

32:13.499 --> 32:16.035
They looked pretty cozy
at the hospital.

32:16.068 --> 32:17.103
- After everything
that happened,

32:17.136 --> 32:19.071
I guess Beth changed her mind.

32:19.105 --> 32:20.539
- Did Mickey know
about the fight club?

32:20.572 --> 32:23.042
- Yeah.
He didn't want her to do it.

32:23.075 --> 32:23.976
- Okay.

32:24.010 --> 32:26.712
What time did Mickey
really leave the party?

32:26.745 --> 32:29.281
- Uh--uh, 20 minutes after Beth?

32:29.315 --> 32:31.150
[phone buzzes]

32:31.183 --> 32:33.019
There's no way
he could've done this.

32:33.052 --> 32:35.354
Mickey's been in love with Beth
since the fifth grade.

32:36.588 --> 32:38.224
- Okay, so TARU's up on
Mickey's phone.

32:38.257 --> 32:39.158
They've got an address.
Benson and Fin

32:39.191 --> 32:40.993
are on their way there now.
- Where is he?

32:41.027 --> 32:44.163
- 850 Como Ave.
That's Beth's mom's house.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.139
- There's Mickey's car.

32:54.340 --> 32:57.343
- Yeah, Mrs. Williams is at
the hospital all night.

32:57.376 --> 32:59.511
What's he doing here?
- Nothing good.

32:59.545 --> 33:02.281
Lights are out inside.
I don't like this.

33:06.385 --> 33:09.055
- NYPD! Open up!

33:09.088 --> 33:10.022
[clattering]

33:10.056 --> 33:12.324
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

33:18.530 --> 33:20.166
Mickey?

33:23.635 --> 33:26.072
Hello?
Anybody home?

33:26.105 --> 33:27.339
- Clear!

33:29.508 --> 33:31.177
- Basement.
- Mickey Reid?

33:31.210 --> 33:33.445
NYPD!
Are you in here?

33:33.479 --> 33:35.181
- Hello?

33:35.214 --> 33:38.016
- Down here, Lieutenant!
- Captain Williams?

33:42.154 --> 33:43.289
- [grunts, pants]
- Captain Williams?

33:43.322 --> 33:44.823
- It's okay! I'm fine.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.126
[grunting, panting]

33:47.159 --> 33:48.527
- Do you have a weapon?

33:48.560 --> 33:50.296
- I have all I need.
[grunts]

33:50.329 --> 33:51.330
- Captain Williams!
Step away!

33:51.363 --> 33:53.799
Step away from him right now!
Finn, call a bus.

33:53.832 --> 33:55.834
Hey, Captain Williams,
step away.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.403
Hey! Listen to me.

33:57.436 --> 34:00.606
- [screaming] No! No! No!
- Step away!

34:00.639 --> 34:04.042
- [sobbing]

34:05.144 --> 34:08.247
- It's okay.
- [sobbing] I'm sorry.

34:08.280 --> 34:11.150
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

34:11.183 --> 34:12.818
- I'm sorry.
- It's over.

34:12.851 --> 34:16.288
- [sobbing]
- It's over now.

34:23.495 --> 34:23.629
.

34:26.165 --> 34:28.834
- I gotta tell ya, Captain,
I am at a loss for words.

34:31.503 --> 34:34.473
How did we get here?
- When I figured out it was him,

34:34.506 --> 34:36.208
I had to handle Mickey my way--

34:36.242 --> 34:38.810
make him look me in the eye,
make him suffer.

34:38.844 --> 34:42.114
But it's over. I'm good now.
- Well, I'm not.

34:42.148 --> 34:45.717
It's not your decision
whether or not we prosecute.

34:49.655 --> 34:52.124
So you wanna tell me
what really happened?

34:52.158 --> 34:56.228
- He was so drunk--
angry.

34:56.262 --> 34:57.696
I tried to calm him down.

34:57.729 --> 35:00.499
He started getting physical,
and I turned to walk away.

35:00.532 --> 35:03.135
- And he hit you?
- Yeah.

35:03.169 --> 35:04.770
Mickey and I--

35:06.872 --> 35:09.241
We've been going in
different directions for years.

35:09.275 --> 35:10.542
His world kept getting smaller,

35:10.576 --> 35:12.411
and my world
kept getting bigger.

35:12.444 --> 35:15.514
- He obviously has
a lot of pent-up anger.

35:15.547 --> 35:16.482
Look, I gotta tell ya.

35:16.515 --> 35:21.620
You've put me in
a very difficult position.

35:21.653 --> 35:24.190
You've lost all credibility
as a witness,

35:24.223 --> 35:26.858
and not to mention what you just
did in there is a crime.

35:26.892 --> 35:29.161
- He deserved it.
- I understand that.

35:29.195 --> 35:30.796
But the DA's office--

35:30.829 --> 35:33.532
not a big fan of
vigilante justice.

35:33.565 --> 35:34.700
- Are you gonna charge me
with a crime?

35:34.733 --> 35:37.769
- I don't know.

35:37.803 --> 35:40.772
If you start to cooperate,
and help us convict Mickey,

35:40.806 --> 35:43.642
I will talk to the DA,
and see if we can help you out.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.850
We're arraigning Mickey
tomorrow morning.

35:51.883 --> 35:55.487
I would like you to be there.

35:55.521 --> 35:58.557
[siren wails]

36:00.592 --> 36:03.195
- People versus Michael Reid.

36:03.229 --> 36:04.530
Are you Michael Anthony Reid?

36:04.563 --> 36:06.898
Is that your true
and correct name?

36:06.932 --> 36:08.467
- Yes, Your Honor.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.637
- On the charge of
rape in the first degree,

36:11.670 --> 36:13.705
how do you plead?
- Not guilty.

36:13.739 --> 36:15.774
And we request RoR.

36:15.807 --> 36:19.211
Mr. Reid is gainfully employed,
has no priors,

36:19.245 --> 36:21.780
and has numerous ties
to the community.

36:21.813 --> 36:23.315
He is not a flight risk.

36:23.349 --> 36:25.217
- [sighs] I cannot believe
she's not here.

36:25.251 --> 36:27.486
- Given the defendant's record
and ties to the community,

36:27.519 --> 36:30.256
I'm denying People's request
for remand.

36:31.690 --> 36:34.926
- Yes, this is Lieutenant Benson
calling from the NYPD.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.963
I'm trying to locate
Captain Beth Williams.

36:39.598 --> 36:41.267
Yes, thank you very much.

36:44.603 --> 36:45.804
I know that you feel

36:45.837 --> 36:48.607
like you've made
your peace with this,

36:48.640 --> 36:50.776
but I like I said,

36:50.809 --> 36:54.513
you need to tell a jury
what Mickey did to you.

36:54.546 --> 36:55.814
- What I let him do to me.

36:55.847 --> 36:58.584
- None of this is on you--

36:58.617 --> 36:59.551
none of it.

36:59.585 --> 37:01.887
- I was supposed to be
a courageous leader,

37:01.920 --> 37:04.556
a role model for
all the little girls out there.

37:04.590 --> 37:05.657
I feel like a fraud.

37:05.691 --> 37:07.826
- Look, something like this
changes you.

37:07.859 --> 37:10.529
But it doesn't reduce you.

37:10.562 --> 37:13.565
You can still be
that role model.

37:13.599 --> 37:15.667
You are courageous.

37:15.701 --> 37:18.704
And if you testify,
I am confident

37:18.737 --> 37:20.572
that we can put Mickey
behind bars

37:20.606 --> 37:24.543
for a very long time.

37:24.576 --> 37:28.547
- If I testify...

37:28.580 --> 37:31.850
will my name get out there?
- Yes, it's possible.

37:31.883 --> 37:36.322
But in my work over the years
with survivors,

37:36.355 --> 37:40.025
there is this amazing power--

37:40.058 --> 37:43.695
this freedom--
in coming forward.

37:43.729 --> 37:46.632
- It's different.

37:46.665 --> 37:49.335
I'm a soldier.
- No, it isn't.

37:52.338 --> 37:54.673
Rangers lead the way...

37:54.706 --> 37:56.408
remember?

38:03.715 --> 38:07.386
Are you sure?
- Yes, positive.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.722
- I'm proud of you, Captain.

38:10.756 --> 38:12.290
- Beth.

38:32.378 --> 38:34.012
Good afternoon.

38:34.045 --> 38:37.416
As you know, Michael Reid
was just indicted for rape.

38:37.449 --> 38:42.388
I instructed the court to not
refer to the victim as Jane Doe.

38:42.421 --> 38:45.757
I feel it is my duty
to step forward--

38:45.791 --> 38:47.726
to tell the world the truth.

38:49.795 --> 38:53.031
My name is
Captain Beth Williams.

38:53.064 --> 38:57.035
On January 8th, I was raped.

38:58.437 --> 39:03.375
This does not lessen my ability
or worth as a soldier.

39:03.409 --> 39:06.011
It will not define me.

39:06.044 --> 39:08.914
It will not break me.

39:08.947 --> 39:12.918
I'm not ashamed of
what happened.

39:12.951 --> 39:16.422
I stand here
with one mission only--

39:16.455 --> 39:19.157
to encourage other survivors
of sexual assault

39:19.190 --> 39:20.726
to do the same.

39:22.728 --> 39:27.433
There is only honor
in being a survivor.
