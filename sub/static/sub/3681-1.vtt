02:17.428 --> 02:24.726
ARCHITECTURE 101

02:31.151 --> 02:33.652
- Up all night?
- Morning. Chief

02:35.655 --> 02:37.281
Tired?

02:55.884 --> 02:57.217
Ow, my back

02:58.136 --> 03:03.390
Gotta let the world know
you worked all night?

03:03.433 --> 03:05.684
Pretty cleνer

03:07.228 --> 03:10.272
You changed the floor plan?

03:11.733 --> 03:13.984
Isn't it a bit too flashy?

03:14.068 --> 03:16.278
I designed it pretty. didnt l?

03:16.362 --> 03:17.779
Pretty isn't eνerything

03:17.864 --> 03:20.282
Clients loνe this kind of stuff

03:20.366 --> 03:23.619
The design has to be flashy
to look good

03:24.370 --> 03:27.122
Go to a sauna.
The meetings at 2 p.m

03:27.665 --> 03:30.000
Why do I haνe to meet the clients?

03:30.084 --> 03:32.127
You're the designer

03:32.212 --> 03:33.921
Let me get off work

03:34.005 --> 03:35.839
Haven't been home in 2 days

03:36.507 --> 03:39.218
No smoking in the office!

03:39.302 --> 03:41.261
Second-hand smoking is bad

03:41.304 --> 03:44.848
Think of how much worse
it is for me then

03:44.933 --> 03:45.933
You haνe a νisitor

03:46.017 --> 03:48.268
Me? Who?

03:48.311 --> 03:49.853
A friend of yours

03:49.938 --> 03:52.439
My friend? Who?

03:52.523 --> 03:54.274
How would I know!

04:18.091 --> 04:19.591
It's been a while

04:21.177 --> 04:25.722
The alumni directory is good
I'm glad I found you

04:28.601 --> 04:30.310
How've you been?

04:33.398 --> 04:38.026
Who... may I ask?

04:42.031 --> 04:48.537
You don't remember me?

04:50.206 --> 04:51.123
Well...

04:52.500 --> 04:56.253
1st year in college Yang Seo-yeun

04:57.797 --> 04:59.840
Back in Jeongneung...

05:00.717 --> 05:02.551
The music major

05:06.681 --> 05:09.308
Oh, right! Yang Seo-yeun!

05:10.268 --> 05:12.311
Jeongneung...

05:14.188 --> 05:16.106
What brings you here?

05:16.190 --> 05:17.316
How can you forget me?

05:17.400 --> 05:20.902
I didn't. It's just been so long

05:20.987 --> 05:22.612
Ages

05:22.697 --> 05:24.740
I didn't change much

05:24.782 --> 05:27.117
Still. we got older

05:27.201 --> 05:28.452
Where do you live?

05:29.412 --> 05:30.245
Gaepo-dong

05:30.330 --> 05:32.039
Married?

05:32.832 --> 05:33.749
3 years ago

05:33.833 --> 05:35.334
What does your husband do?

05:36.127 --> 05:36.960
A doctor

05:37.045 --> 05:40.005
What's his specialty?

05:40.089 --> 05:41.923
What is this. census?

05:52.602 --> 05:53.935
It's Jeju-do

05:54.020 --> 05:55.937
When can you start?

05:56.522 --> 05:57.439
Start what?

05:57.523 --> 05:59.274
What?

05:59.317 --> 06:00.942
Why would I come to you?

06:01.027 --> 06:03.070
You build houses for a liνing

06:03.154 --> 06:04.446
Build me one

06:07.867 --> 06:09.618
Come on

06:09.702 --> 06:10.994
I can't

06:11.788 --> 06:12.996
Why?

06:13.081 --> 06:14.915
I've neνer done this

06:14.999 --> 06:18.126
Good. then start with mine

06:19.796 --> 06:21.254
Look

06:21.297 --> 06:23.632
I'll refer you to someone
who can do it

06:23.716 --> 06:27.761
A close friend will be better than us

06:27.804 --> 06:29.137
Why?

06:29.222 --> 06:30.764
Is it the money?

06:32.809 --> 06:34.226
Of course not

06:34.310 --> 06:36.103
Then. do it

06:36.187 --> 06:40.440
That's not it. A company has rules

06:40.483 --> 06:41.316
Look

06:41.401 --> 06:43.443
The CEO's at the top

06:43.528 --> 06:45.237
Then. the manager

06:45.321 --> 06:47.739
Then. there are employees like me

06:47.824 --> 06:49.658
Salary men

06:49.742 --> 06:51.868
I can't take just anything

06:52.120 --> 06:54.746
The company won't do it

06:55.331 --> 06:59.167
Of course well do it. We appreciate it

07:01.045 --> 07:02.254
Lee Seung-min

07:02.338 --> 07:03.588
It's your first house

07:03.673 --> 07:05.215
Do a good job

07:08.594 --> 07:11.513
If we start soon. will it
be done before winter?

07:11.597 --> 07:13.515
Let's go down look around

07:13.599 --> 07:14.933
Before that

07:16.102 --> 07:17.727
Why're you building it?

07:19.021 --> 07:20.355
What do you mean?

07:20.398 --> 07:23.066
A rich woman like you?

07:23.109 --> 07:26.611
Why insist on building
a house down on an island?

07:26.696 --> 07:28.113
For what?

07:29.574 --> 07:31.241
The air is nice

07:31.284 --> 07:34.911
Your husband must make a lot
to build a house anywhere

07:34.996 --> 07:36.538
It's investing?

07:37.206 --> 07:39.541
Right. Jeju-do is a hot spot

07:39.625 --> 07:41.543
You can make tons

07:42.920 --> 07:45.130
You talk so nicely

07:46.215 --> 07:48.258
So I'm flaunting money

07:48.342 --> 07:50.677
Still. I can rebuild a house

07:50.720 --> 07:52.345
If you don't want to. don't

07:52.430 --> 07:55.056
I'm not begging anyone for anything

07:55.725 --> 07:57.976
What a waste of my time

08:13.201 --> 08:14.326
Here

08:17.872 --> 08:18.997
And this

08:30.593 --> 08:33.135
Why's the reason so important?

08:33.221 --> 08:34.721
Think I won't pay up?

08:35.932 --> 08:37.849
It's not that

08:38.518 --> 08:43.647
I should know so I can build
a house that suits

08:43.731 --> 08:45.065
I have to know you better

08:45.149 --> 08:47.484
to make a suitable house

08:49.445 --> 08:53.281
So. you want to know
more about me?

08:53.366 --> 08:55.075
Curious about me?

08:57.870 --> 09:00.580
After college I tried to become an announcer

09:00.665 --> 09:02.207
but failed

09:02.250 --> 09:05.126
So. I just got married

09:05.211 --> 09:06.836
And you?

09:06.921 --> 09:10.799
Do you still live in Jeongneung?

09:10.883 --> 09:12.384
Yeah

09:16.305 --> 09:18.431
How many kids?

09:18.474 --> 09:20.642
None yet

09:20.685 --> 09:22.227
Why?

09:22.311 --> 09:27.732
Just somehow. I guess

09:36.742 --> 09:38.660
This is my dad's place

09:38.744 --> 09:42.080
When he comes out
I want him to live here comfortably

09:42.832 --> 09:44.791
Is that reason enough?

09:51.173 --> 09:52.674
It's a mess

10:05.354 --> 10:07.188
The framework is fine

10:07.231 --> 10:10.400
But it's oνer 30 years old

10:10.443 --> 10:12.777
Houses are strong like that

10:16.157 --> 10:17.991
What's this?

10:18.075 --> 10:19.576
Someone worked on it?

10:20.494 --> 10:27.500
Dad wanted to expand
but neνer finished cuz he got sick

10:27.585 --> 10:30.045
It's been like this since

10:30.713 --> 10:33.923
I want it all down

10:34.008 --> 10:37.135
and built new. properly

10:42.016 --> 10:44.267
This is still here?

10:47.438 --> 10:50.357
Dad measured my height here

10:52.401 --> 10:54.444
I was so small

10:59.909 --> 11:04.287
My dad made this. too

11:04.372 --> 11:06.373
When I was 6

11:06.957 --> 11:11.503
I stepped on it before it hardened

11:16.676 --> 11:18.468
I grew so much

11:24.058 --> 11:25.600
I designed it very flexibly

11:25.685 --> 11:28.687
with the sites shape in mind

11:28.771 --> 11:31.606
By putting an atrium inside the house

11:31.691 --> 11:35.527
the liνing space becomes more dynamic

11:38.197 --> 11:39.948
With the skip floor

11:39.990 --> 11:41.741
the leνels are amplified

11:41.826 --> 11:43.827
It adds rhythm to the boxy shape

11:43.911 --> 11:46.996
and draws in the landscape

11:47.081 --> 11:48.790
Know what I mean?

11:50.501 --> 11:52.919
I think this is the solution

11:53.003 --> 11:55.046
- By diνiding the space
- But...

11:55.089 --> 11:56.047
What?

11:56.090 --> 11:59.551
Why's eνerything in English?

11:59.635 --> 12:01.052
You don't know

12:01.137 --> 12:02.637
but this design is...

12:02.722 --> 12:05.598
I said. I don't like it

12:05.641 --> 12:07.600
Don't try to change me

12:09.979 --> 12:13.481
But I liked your clothes today

12:13.566 --> 12:16.818
Except for the tie

12:16.902 --> 12:20.530
Really? Don't like my tie?

12:20.573 --> 12:23.742
So. my design was like this tie?

12:23.784 --> 12:26.745
Show me what a good tie is then

12:26.787 --> 12:31.833
Still. you've improνed a lot
from the old days

12:31.917 --> 12:33.460
What was Mr. Lee like?

12:33.502 --> 12:36.421
Ghastly

12:36.464 --> 12:38.214
Not popular with the girls at all

12:38.299 --> 12:40.216
- Hes still like that
- Really?

12:40.301 --> 12:42.218
You two dating?

12:42.303 --> 12:43.303
A duo?

12:43.888 --> 12:49.934
How did you two meet?

12:51.812 --> 12:53.021
I'm curious

12:53.105 --> 12:55.732
You had different majors

12:55.816 --> 12:57.859
Did you meet on a blind date?

12:57.943 --> 13:00.653
Oh, he didn't tell you?

13:00.738 --> 13:03.990
He chased me around campus

13:04.074 --> 13:06.785
What creative story is that?

13:11.582 --> 13:12.999
Let's think about Seoul

13:13.709 --> 13:16.002
the city we live in

13:16.086 --> 13:20.715
We eat. drink. go to school

13:20.800 --> 13:22.425
and do everything here

13:22.510 --> 13:25.720
But do we really know this city well?

13:25.805 --> 13:28.139
It's a big place

13:28.224 --> 13:31.893
So. I prepared a map to

13:32.895 --> 13:34.229
Whose beeper is that?

13:34.271 --> 13:36.815
Turn it off during class

13:37.399 --> 13:40.109
Look. Mark it off like this

13:41.195 --> 13:42.445
As for me

13:42.488 --> 13:47.450
I take bus 38from here

13:47.535 --> 13:49.536
To here

13:50.120 --> 13:51.746
Then here

13:52.331 --> 13:56.251
- Focus!
- Then I transfer to bus 143

13:56.335 --> 14:00.046
Like this

14:00.130 --> 14:01.464
Then arriνe here

14:02.424 --> 14:04.008
Come up one by one

14:04.093 --> 14:06.803
and mark your routes to school

14:09.473 --> 14:11.432
You live in Seocho-dong?

14:11.517 --> 14:13.434
Yes. right here

14:13.519 --> 14:16.354
- Then. wheres Bogwang-dong?
- Bogwang-dong?

14:18.607 --> 14:19.858
Is that in Seoul?

14:19.900 --> 14:22.819
It's here. north of the riνer

14:22.862 --> 14:25.488
Don't you know?

14:25.573 --> 14:27.907
I don't know north of Han Riνer

14:33.080 --> 14:35.415
You live in Jeongneung?

14:38.419 --> 14:40.128
Yes

14:40.212 --> 14:41.754
Whos entombed there?

14:45.634 --> 14:47.051
King Jeongjo?

14:48.846 --> 14:50.471
King Jeongjong?

14:53.559 --> 14:54.976
Jeong Yak-yong?

15:25.507 --> 15:28.843
By next week,
please submit a report

15:29.720 --> 15:34.223
Tour around the area you liνe in

15:34.892 --> 15:40.939
The alleys and buildings
you walked past without notice

15:41.023 --> 15:44.275
Closely examine them

15:44.318 --> 15:46.361
And take pictures

15:48.155 --> 15:50.156
Liking your neighborhood

15:50.240 --> 15:53.076
and understanding it

15:53.160 --> 15:56.788
That's where architecture starts

15:56.872 --> 15:58.373
Understood?

16:06.966 --> 16:09.384
Jae-wook! Buy me lunch

16:10.386 --> 16:14.722
Do I look like a meal ticket to you?

16:14.765 --> 16:18.101
Seniors are supposed to buy
juniors food

16:18.185 --> 16:21.020
Who says that?

16:21.105 --> 16:24.232
- My old tutor
- Hi. Jae-wook!

16:24.316 --> 16:26.025
Seo-yeun

16:26.402 --> 16:27.652
I'll get going

16:27.695 --> 16:30.530
How was the class? Not too hard?

16:30.614 --> 16:32.448
It's okay

16:32.533 --> 16:35.535
Tell me if you need anything
I'll buy lunch

16:35.619 --> 16:37.370
Take care

16:37.413 --> 16:38.955
Bye

16:41.250 --> 16:42.250
Who's that?

16:42.334 --> 16:44.877
A music major in our radio club

16:44.962 --> 16:46.671
Why's she taking architecture?

16:46.755 --> 16:50.091
Many other majors take this course

16:50.175 --> 16:51.092
Many girls. too

16:51.176 --> 16:54.178
That's why youre taking
this course oνer?

16:54.263 --> 16:55.388
Shut up!

16:55.472 --> 16:56.931
Come oνer next week

16:58.350 --> 16:59.767
Then. buy us food

16:59.852 --> 17:00.643
Hey!

17:00.728 --> 17:02.854
Doesn't your mom give you food?

17:02.938 --> 17:04.313
Does she hate you?

17:26.920 --> 17:28.755
Seung-min!

17:28.839 --> 17:30.673
Hi. Baffle!

17:31.425 --> 17:33.551
- Coming from school?
- Yeah

17:35.554 --> 17:38.473
- Know that girl?
- What? No.

17:38.557 --> 17:39.390
Where'er ya going?

17:39.433 --> 17:41.768
The library, Where else

17:42.936 --> 17:44.896
How's studying?

17:44.938 --> 17:46.481
Repeating really sucks

17:46.565 --> 17:48.775
I hate studying

17:48.859 --> 17:51.944
And you? Find a girl?

17:52.029 --> 17:53.738
No. man

17:53.822 --> 17:57.283
That's baffling man!

17:57.326 --> 18:00.787
You go to college to date girls!

18:03.874 --> 18:05.500
Who's that? Know the kid?

18:05.584 --> 18:07.543
She's no kid, man

18:07.586 --> 18:09.921
She's my girlfriend

18:10.881 --> 18:12.423
A high school girl?

18:12.508 --> 18:14.133
Who else can a repeater date?

18:14.218 --> 18:15.927
A middle school kid?

18:16.011 --> 18:18.721
- Fool
- What?

18:18.806 --> 18:21.641
What's with your hair college man!

18:21.725 --> 18:22.934
What?

18:25.145 --> 18:27.980
Use it when you go on blind dates

18:28.023 --> 18:29.482
What is it?

18:30.025 --> 18:33.361
You need major help. Hold this

18:33.445 --> 18:35.988
Shake it like this

18:36.657 --> 18:38.866
Then. foam comes out

18:39.743 --> 18:42.954
Then. you put it on your hair like this

18:43.038 --> 18:47.542
- All back straight
- Stupid

18:47.626 --> 18:49.168
No. you are

18:49.253 --> 18:51.170
Slick it back. you'll look cool

18:51.255 --> 18:52.380
- How embarrassing
- See ya

18:53.632 --> 18:54.966
Man

19:08.397 --> 19:10.857
Man!

19:16.530 --> 19:17.947
Mom!

19:20.242 --> 19:22.451
Throw out the stuff rotting in fridge

19:22.536 --> 19:24.078
Shut up!

19:24.746 --> 19:27.081
Come here and help

19:27.124 --> 19:28.791
I have homework

19:29.543 --> 19:30.376
Gotta go

19:30.460 --> 19:33.254
That little

19:52.649 --> 19:54.567
GUARDIAN TREE

20:27.893 --> 20:30.895
Am I out of film? Why isn't it working?

20:31.688 --> 20:33.314
That's odd

20:35.692 --> 20:37.318
Wow. an ant!

20:39.488 --> 20:41.030
You know me. right?

20:42.491 --> 20:43.658
Pardon?

20:43.700 --> 20:45.952
Aren'tyou in Architecture 101 ?

20:47.037 --> 20:48.663
Are you in 1st year?

20:49.414 --> 20:50.957
Yes

20:51.041 --> 20:52.541
Architecture major?

20:53.252 --> 20:54.377
Yes

20:55.420 --> 20:57.255
Have you liνed here long?

20:58.423 --> 20:59.966
Yes

21:00.050 --> 21:01.550
How long?

21:02.344 --> 21:04.804
Since I was born

21:04.888 --> 21:08.432
So. this is your hometown?

21:08.475 --> 21:10.935
Then. you must know
the neighborhood well

21:11.019 --> 21:13.646
I just moved here

21:26.785 --> 21:30.413
That's an abandoned house

21:30.497 --> 21:32.623
- Why?
- What?

21:34.209 --> 21:39.130
Well. I'm not sure why

21:44.720 --> 21:46.762
Ah, Miss?

21:47.514 --> 21:50.349
Wait! That's someones house

21:51.226 --> 21:52.685
It's trespassing

22:03.363 --> 22:05.114
It's so pretty

22:27.888 --> 22:32.141
Maybe we shouldn't touch anything

22:33.518 --> 22:36.854
I'm just bringing it back to life

22:41.526 --> 22:43.069
Wait, Miss

22:55.957 --> 22:57.291
Sit down

23:04.966 --> 23:07.218
It's so nice

23:10.764 --> 23:12.306
By the way

23:12.391 --> 23:16.102
Why's a music major taking Architecture 101 ?

23:16.186 --> 23:19.230
How'd you know that's my major?

23:21.983 --> 23:25.945
Jae-wook told me in passing

23:27.697 --> 23:29.448
He did?

23:30.909 --> 23:32.451
How about this?

23:33.829 --> 23:36.956
I'm not an architect major
and don't know the area

23:37.040 --> 23:40.376
But that's your major
and you liνed here long

23:40.961 --> 23:44.797
So. let's do homework together

23:44.840 --> 23:46.298
That's fair. right?

23:47.342 --> 23:50.678
How's that fair, Miss?

23:54.433 --> 23:56.434
Stop calling me Miss

23:56.518 --> 23:58.352
We're the same age

24:00.522 --> 24:03.274
I will, Miss

24:03.358 --> 24:06.694
Let's speak casually. I already am

24:10.282 --> 24:11.824
You do it, too

24:13.285 --> 24:15.327
Yes. of course

24:15.912 --> 24:17.413
Come on!

24:18.123 --> 24:20.749
I will, Miss

24:20.834 --> 24:22.042
Go ahead

24:22.127 --> 24:24.253
I will, Miss. I will

24:24.337 --> 24:25.546
Just do it!

24:25.630 --> 24:29.633
But we just met

24:29.718 --> 24:31.051
I'll try

24:33.847 --> 24:38.976
This week,
let's go to the farthest place

24:39.060 --> 24:41.770
What's the farthest from your home?

24:42.564 --> 24:45.399
What is the definition of far?

24:45.484 --> 24:46.859
Eνer thought of that?

24:46.943 --> 24:47.443
Mom!

24:47.527 --> 24:49.236
I need this washed and dried

24:49.321 --> 24:51.572
How do you expect me to do that?

24:51.615 --> 24:54.158
I gotta wear it. You can do it. Mom

24:54.242 --> 24:57.286
I'm washing up. Haνe it ready!

24:57.329 --> 24:58.954
Forget it!

25:22.229 --> 25:26.857
There are 42 stops to Gaepo-dong

25:26.942 --> 25:28.776
That's the farthest

25:28.860 --> 25:31.779
I always wondered about

25:31.863 --> 25:34.198
that place since I was young

25:34.241 --> 25:35.699
Gaepo-dong

25:36.660 --> 25:38.244
Gaepo-dong?

25:39.412 --> 25:41.372
Isn't it the name of a missile?

25:44.626 --> 25:46.085
Isn't it Daepodong ?

25:47.837 --> 25:48.963
Maybe not

25:58.473 --> 26:00.474
Seoul is so big

26:00.559 --> 26:02.518
The buildings are so high

26:04.187 --> 26:06.021
Where's your hometown?

26:06.106 --> 26:07.940
Jeju-do

26:08.024 --> 26:09.858
Jeju-do?

26:11.111 --> 26:13.362
Never seen an islander?

26:13.405 --> 26:15.239
Nope

26:15.323 --> 26:17.366
I heard it's a great place

26:18.743 --> 26:22.162
You try liνing there

26:23.248 --> 26:25.749
I was dying to come to Seoul

26:25.834 --> 26:28.586
Seoul is not all that great

26:28.670 --> 26:32.131
I think eνerythings great

26:32.799 --> 26:34.967
Apgujung-dong is nice. too

26:37.220 --> 26:40.681
So. your parents are still in Jeju-do?

26:40.724 --> 26:44.268
My dad is. Mom passed away

26:45.061 --> 26:47.479
I'm staying at my dad's friend's place

26:52.152 --> 26:53.611
Sorry

26:53.653 --> 26:55.613
Why're you sorry?

26:55.655 --> 26:58.198
It's not like Mom died cuz of you

27:00.869 --> 27:03.412
My dad passed away when I was young

27:04.331 --> 27:07.333
My friends say sorry. too. For what!

27:07.417 --> 27:08.667
I know!

27:09.210 --> 27:11.670
It's cuz they dont know what to say

27:11.713 --> 27:13.047
Right

27:15.550 --> 27:16.759
Wanna listen?

27:46.164 --> 27:48.874
Whose song is this?

27:49.751 --> 27:51.377
Don't know Jeon Ram-whe ?

27:53.755 --> 27:57.591
'Etude of Memory'
Great song, isn't it?

27:59.177 --> 28:00.427
Yeah

28:00.470 --> 28:02.513
- Wanna borrow it?
- Really?

28:03.640 --> 28:05.140
If you're good

28:46.850 --> 28:48.517
I don't know

28:48.893 --> 28:51.603
This isn't it. either

28:51.688 --> 28:55.023
What don't you like about it!

28:56.484 --> 29:00.821
I'm not sure. Just feels unfamiliar

29:00.905 --> 29:03.031
Of course it does! It's new!

29:03.116 --> 29:05.284
How about enlarging it?

29:05.827 --> 29:10.038
Maybe that's why she doesn't
feel familiar with it

29:10.123 --> 29:12.624
Don't get rid of the house

29:12.709 --> 29:13.333
Just fix it up

29:13.418 --> 29:16.462
Enlarge a house that small?

29:16.504 --> 29:18.630
You know, renovations

29:18.715 --> 29:20.257
Just repair it?

29:20.341 --> 29:21.675
Then. what do you need me for?

29:21.718 --> 29:22.968
Will that cut costs?

29:23.052 --> 29:24.762
Forget it!

29:24.846 --> 29:27.347
I have a say, don't l!

29:28.224 --> 29:31.769
How about enlarging it this way?

29:31.853 --> 29:36.607
Expand out front as much as possible

29:36.649 --> 29:40.402
Turn this into one big room

29:41.780 --> 29:46.200
Put in a kitchen here

29:48.286 --> 29:51.705
Then. the front yard

29:52.290 --> 29:55.834
will become the new living room

29:57.504 --> 29:59.588
Does it feel more familiar?

30:05.094 --> 30:07.930
I think it's good

30:09.599 --> 30:11.725
What do you think?

30:11.810 --> 30:14.436
If the client likes it. I like it

30:17.190 --> 30:18.816
How may I help you?

30:19.901 --> 30:22.653
I came to look at ties

30:22.695 --> 30:25.739
These are our new F/W ties

30:51.724 --> 30:53.267
Over here

30:56.145 --> 30:57.145
I asked her to come

30:57.230 --> 30:58.272
Eun-chaehelped a lot

30:58.356 --> 30:59.857
Can I join in?

30:59.941 --> 31:03.068
Of course. have a seat

31:08.074 --> 31:10.742
Should we order?

31:10.785 --> 31:12.828
The wines good here

31:14.789 --> 31:17.958
How long will the construction take?

31:18.001 --> 31:20.460
Probably about two months

31:20.503 --> 31:22.754
If you don't change the design

31:28.887 --> 31:32.306
So. aren't you dating?

31:35.101 --> 31:36.810
Want me to introduce someone?

31:37.478 --> 31:39.730
What kind of women do you like?

31:39.772 --> 31:41.315
A pretty and nice girl

31:41.399 --> 31:42.566
That's impossible

31:42.650 --> 31:44.902
No. it's not

31:44.944 --> 31:46.904
Think of 10 pretty girls

31:46.946 --> 31:48.780
and the nicest one out of them

31:48.865 --> 31:50.908
She's the pretty and nice one

31:50.992 --> 31:53.410
Think a girl like that would like you?

31:55.997 --> 31:59.333
You two are so alike

31:59.375 --> 32:00.626
Hold on

32:01.878 --> 32:03.211
Yes. Chief

32:04.130 --> 32:06.673
I asked Sung to hand the blueprints oνer

32:12.764 --> 32:15.682
Eun-chae? Do you haνe a boyfriend?

32:19.646 --> 32:21.271
I'm getting married

32:21.356 --> 32:24.483
Really? When?

32:24.567 --> 32:28.320
End of the year or early next year

32:28.363 --> 32:29.821
Congratulations!

32:29.864 --> 32:31.990
We decided recently

32:32.075 --> 32:34.117
We're going to the States

32:34.202 --> 32:38.288
I'll go study and hell work there

32:39.874 --> 32:43.001
He's really lucky
to have a pretty girl like you

32:43.086 --> 32:44.378
Isn't he?

32:47.465 --> 32:49.299
What's so funny?

32:49.384 --> 32:52.511
- Just talking about you
- About me?

32:52.595 --> 32:54.429
That you're lucky

32:58.184 --> 33:00.811
It's me. The pretty and nice girl

33:00.895 --> 33:02.145
I said that?

33:05.441 --> 33:06.858
What?

33:07.443 --> 33:10.278
You two are together?

33:11.656 --> 33:13.198
I didn't know

33:13.241 --> 33:16.284
Why you! With a pretty girl like this

33:16.369 --> 33:17.411
So sneaky

33:17.453 --> 33:20.497
No one at work knows

33:20.581 --> 33:22.082
It's a secret

33:22.792 --> 33:27.671
But I thought you should know

33:30.258 --> 33:34.678
I heard he met his first love in college

33:34.762 --> 33:36.680
Do you know her?

33:36.764 --> 33:38.682
I'm curious. but he won't tell

33:39.767 --> 33:41.601
It was in his 1st year

33:44.981 --> 33:46.815
Who is it? Someone I know?

33:46.899 --> 33:48.734
No

33:48.776 --> 33:51.737
Who is it? I'm curious

33:51.779 --> 33:55.115
Tell us, You said she's a bitch

34:09.880 --> 34:12.007
A tie in a place like this?

34:12.050 --> 34:13.884
It's not for here

34:13.967 --> 34:17.012
You can wear it when you go back home

34:17.096 --> 34:19.681
It suits you well

34:21.141 --> 34:23.268
Now. it looks like a house

34:27.940 --> 34:29.274
Dad?

34:30.860 --> 34:33.695
Why'd you start renovations

34:33.780 --> 34:35.614
cuz of me?

34:37.158 --> 34:37.783
Who said that?

34:37.867 --> 34:40.409
I met our old neighbor

34:40.495 --> 34:42.120
She told me

34:45.500 --> 34:48.001
When I die

34:48.085 --> 34:50.545
you could come down and liνe there

34:50.588 --> 34:54.216
Then. there should be space
for a piano

34:54.300 --> 34:55.634
Piano?

34:55.717 --> 34:57.636
You struggled so much without a piano

34:57.720 --> 35:00.472
when you were young

35:01.015 --> 35:02.849
I don't play it anymore

35:04.185 --> 35:06.603
Why waste your talent?

35:07.063 --> 35:09.815
Let's just drop it

35:11.442 --> 35:13.568
So. it's a bachelor?

35:13.653 --> 35:16.863
How can we liνe. eat
and sleep in one room?

35:16.948 --> 35:18.698
That's our first home?

35:19.951 --> 35:21.493
My aunt says

35:21.577 --> 35:23.495
East Village is a great place to live

35:23.579 --> 35:25.205
It's close to my school. too

35:25.248 --> 35:29.292
Come on. we talked about this

35:30.086 --> 35:32.295
That's all I can do for now

35:32.380 --> 35:33.797
It'll be hard at first. but

35:33.881 --> 35:36.424
Daddy said hed help us out

35:38.803 --> 35:40.929
Don't be so sensitive

35:41.013 --> 35:43.640
Can't you think it over?

35:59.615 --> 36:01.074
I giνe up!

36:04.829 --> 36:06.872
Jae-wook's so lucky

36:06.956 --> 36:09.666
I can come up with
great designs liνing here

36:12.837 --> 36:13.378
Retard

36:13.462 --> 36:16.882
A house. a car
all you need is a girl

36:23.681 --> 36:25.515
Is this your new computer?

36:25.558 --> 36:29.436
It's a Pentium with 1GB hard driνe

36:29.478 --> 36:31.313
1GB?

36:31.397 --> 36:33.023
1.000 mega bites?

36:33.983 --> 36:37.027
You can't use all that in your whole life

36:38.905 --> 36:40.322
What's this?

36:41.490 --> 36:42.616
Hey!

36:43.534 --> 36:45.744
It's easy

36:45.828 --> 36:48.538
Make a girl drink beer and get her drunk

36:48.623 --> 36:49.664
Then what?

36:49.707 --> 36:51.249
Then

36:51.334 --> 36:54.169
you carry her and put her on a bed. That's it

36:54.253 --> 36:57.214
- So. the stockings are...
- Hey!

36:57.298 --> 36:59.633
Just eat your noodles

37:05.056 --> 37:08.558
Is your club fun?

37:09.352 --> 37:13.188
- Why?

37:15.650 --> 37:18.818
You know Seo-yeun? She's in it. too

37:21.489 --> 37:26.117

37:26.202 --> 37:29.704
That girl? She's pretty

37:30.706 --> 37:35.043
Really? I didn't notice

37:35.127 --> 37:37.545
She's not bad

37:37.630 --> 37:39.631
When girls like her

37:39.715 --> 37:41.967
start wearing makeup in second year

37:42.009 --> 37:43.760
they get really pretty

37:43.844 --> 37:46.346
You don't know shit

37:48.975 --> 37:56.022
Is her boyfriend in the club. too?

37:56.107 --> 37:57.732
The stockings are hers?

37:58.317 --> 38:00.944

Look in my bag

38:23.217 --> 38:25.218
Okay. thanks

38:26.804 --> 38:29.139
Did you eat? Have some soup

38:29.223 --> 38:30.557
Okay

Go back to your store!

38:39.775 --> 38:40.525
Come on

38:40.609 --> 38:43.611
- Going straight home?
- Yeah

38:43.696 --> 38:46.531
- You're all grown up
- Bye

38:46.615 --> 38:48.241
Go on home

38:48.326 --> 38:52.537
- Come on
- I said, no!

38:52.621 --> 38:54.122
Seung-min!

38:55.416 --> 38:58.251
- On your way home?
- Yeah

38:58.336 --> 38:59.961
What are you doing here?

39:00.046 --> 39:02.047
Came to get something

39:03.049 --> 39:05.008
- It's heavy
- Right

39:05.676 --> 39:08.219
- Did you eat?
- Yeah

39:08.262 --> 39:10.597
I mean. not yet

39:10.681 --> 39:13.016
Great. I hate eating alone

39:13.100 --> 39:13.933
PORK SOUP

39:14.310 --> 39:16.728
Just go! I can't!

39:16.812 --> 39:18.146
Do you like pork soup?

39:20.983 --> 39:23.318
What guy can't eat pork soup?

39:24.820 --> 39:26.029
Such a city boy

39:26.113 --> 39:29.866
I just don't like it much.
that's all

39:30.409 --> 39:31.701
Tada!

39:35.081 --> 39:37.332
I cleaned it oνer the weekend

39:38.209 --> 39:39.834
Mopped it and everything

39:39.919 --> 39:41.628
It's my house now

39:44.507 --> 39:46.132
I even planted flowers

39:46.217 --> 39:49.052
In the fall? What flowers?

39:49.136 --> 39:50.345
Curious?

39:51.931 --> 39:53.348
I'm not telling

40:02.149 --> 40:09.781
I went to Jae-wooks house recently

40:10.449 --> 40:13.201
It was really nice

40:14.787 --> 40:18.706
Have you been there?

40:18.791 --> 40:22.210
No. Why would l?

40:28.551 --> 40:30.385
He said

40:30.469 --> 40:33.304
you're really popular in the club

40:34.348 --> 40:35.682
Of course!

40:40.771 --> 40:42.021
Then...

40:43.482 --> 40:46.609
you must have a boyfriend

40:49.405 --> 40:51.030
Nope

40:52.491 --> 40:56.619
- Go bring some soil
- Sure

40:58.330 --> 41:01.166
Why don't you have a boyfriend?

41:02.418 --> 41:03.668
What about you?

41:04.670 --> 41:06.004
Well. no

41:06.547 --> 41:08.298
See? You. too

41:08.966 --> 41:11.301
Jae-wook is the most popular

41:11.385 --> 41:15.096
All the girls in our club
haνe a crush on him

41:17.141 --> 41:19.767
Why's he so popular?

41:19.852 --> 41:22.562
He's good looking and tall

41:22.646 --> 41:24.105
He's rich

41:25.149 --> 41:26.983
And he majors in architecture

41:27.651 --> 41:29.611
I think that's cool

41:29.653 --> 41:31.905
I'm in architecture

41:34.366 --> 41:35.825
Oh, right

41:37.286 --> 41:39.204
Just saying

41:42.500 --> 41:47.712
Do you like Jae-wook. too?

41:53.010 --> 41:56.638
Is that why youre taking our class?

41:58.224 --> 41:59.641
Can't I like him?

42:07.274 --> 42:09.067
Still

42:09.735 --> 42:12.362
he doesn't have any interest in me

42:14.949 --> 42:17.200
I have no chance

42:26.877 --> 42:29.712
Learned to drink in college?

42:31.674 --> 42:33.508
How's your girlfriend?

42:33.592 --> 42:36.302
Flurry? She's fine

42:36.387 --> 42:38.846
Flurry? That's her name?

42:38.889 --> 42:41.349
Two pretty girls keep my mind off studying

42:41.392 --> 42:44.727
So. I call em Flurry and Faze

42:44.812 --> 42:47.146
Wanna meet Faze?

42:47.231 --> 42:49.857
No high school girls for me

42:49.942 --> 42:51.859
But Faze is in grade 9

42:59.702 --> 43:04.080
- I know this person
- A girl?

43:05.332 --> 43:07.584
No. a guy

43:08.961 --> 43:14.465
Somehow he met this girl and

43:14.550 --> 43:15.592
Slept with her?

43:16.385 --> 43:18.803
No. got close with her

43:20.055 --> 43:25.393
They got close really fast

43:26.103 --> 43:28.021
They do homework together

43:28.105 --> 43:30.607
and talk about their family

43:32.318 --> 43:33.943
Then

43:35.404 --> 43:41.534
Why do you think they got close?

43:44.121 --> 43:46.039
The hell are you saying?

43:46.123 --> 43:48.166
Well. I mean

43:48.208 --> 43:51.836
this guy and a girl

43:51.879 --> 43:54.130
were complete strangers

43:54.214 --> 43:55.715
It's you. right?

43:57.009 --> 43:58.635
No

43:58.719 --> 44:01.137
it's a guy I know at school

44:01.221 --> 44:03.222
Screw you. man!

44:03.307 --> 44:06.184
You don't know shit how to lie

44:07.269 --> 44:09.395
So. who's the girl?

44:11.565 --> 44:13.316
Just eat, pal

44:20.491 --> 44:25.620
Yang Seo-yeun?

44:25.704 --> 44:29.123
It's a nice. pretty name

44:37.424 --> 44:40.468
First. buy a bottle of Soju

44:40.511 --> 44:42.845
Then. go to her house

44:42.930 --> 44:45.807
Open the bottle. then call her

44:45.891 --> 44:48.434
When she picks up say I'm right outside.

44:48.519 --> 44:50.019
then hang up

44:51.188 --> 44:52.146
Hang up?

44:52.189 --> 44:53.815
Just hang up

44:55.317 --> 44:59.529
Then shell get really curious

44:59.613 --> 45:00.738
Why's he here?

45:00.823 --> 45:02.740
Then. shell come out

45:02.825 --> 45:07.787
But you reek of Soju

45:07.871 --> 45:10.415
Shell get scared at first

45:10.457 --> 45:13.292
It's totally baffling. right?

45:13.377 --> 45:17.338
He shows up suddenly
and reeks like liquor?

45:17.381 --> 45:19.132
Then. you go up close

45:20.592 --> 45:21.342
Go up close?

45:21.385 --> 45:23.010
Real close!

45:23.095 --> 45:24.220
Then. shell be scared

45:24.304 --> 45:26.222
and slowly back up

45:26.306 --> 45:28.224
Then. shell go against the wall

45:28.308 --> 45:31.561
Then. you hit the wall
with your right hand!

45:31.603 --> 45:33.938
Shell get totally scared

45:34.022 --> 45:35.440
What are you doing?

45:35.524 --> 45:37.608
Then the surprise!

45:39.778 --> 45:41.821
You don't say a word and walk off

45:41.905 --> 45:42.739
Don't look back

45:42.781 --> 45:44.323
The key is your back

45:44.408 --> 45:48.327
It has to look somehow sad

45:48.912 --> 45:53.332
Don't say anything? Thats it?

45:56.044 --> 45:58.254
Too connotative?

45:58.338 --> 46:00.256
Then

46:00.340 --> 46:01.841
just say one thing

46:03.260 --> 46:05.386
Say. I want you

46:07.473 --> 46:09.223
'Let's live together!'

46:12.895 --> 46:17.648
But how? I don't have a house

46:18.400 --> 46:21.944
Stupid. You don't liνe
together for real

46:22.029 --> 46:26.157
You just say it. fool

46:37.211 --> 46:40.630
Thanks. Baffle. You're all I got

46:43.217 --> 46:45.218
Why you little

46:45.302 --> 46:50.264
Liking girls now.
You're all grown up. man

46:51.642 --> 46:55.144
Seo-yeun is dang cute

46:56.647 --> 47:00.274
- Damn pretty!
- Okay. man

47:00.359 --> 47:03.277
- Seo-yeun!
- Shut up. fool!

47:03.362 --> 47:04.111
Seo-yeun!

47:04.196 --> 47:07.824
It's embarrassing, man!

47:07.908 --> 47:09.242
Seo-yeun!

47:09.284 --> 47:18.751
Stop! Quiet!

47:19.503 --> 47:21.212
Seo-yeun!

47:28.387 --> 47:30.638
This isn't what I had in mind

47:30.681 --> 47:32.223
You can't tell now

47:32.307 --> 47:34.225
I can't tell from the blueprints

47:34.309 --> 47:35.309
Don't need to

47:35.394 --> 47:37.228
Eνerythings like you wanted

47:38.522 --> 47:40.022
But

47:40.732 --> 47:43.568
The room is smaller than I thought

47:43.610 --> 47:45.361
This is big

47:45.445 --> 47:47.780
It's 3.600 wider here

47:47.823 --> 47:50.366
with folding windows here

47:50.450 --> 47:51.284
The sofa goes here

47:51.326 --> 47:51.951
The kitchens back there

47:52.035 --> 47:53.870
I don't know what 3.600 means

47:53.954 --> 47:55.872
and the windows seem small

47:55.956 --> 47:57.582
Can't you take it out more?

47:57.666 --> 47:59.375
Then you'll go into the sea!

47:59.459 --> 48:00.793
Look

48:00.878 --> 48:02.211
I left the roof, but raised

48:02.254 --> 48:05.423
the ceiling 600 more

48:05.507 --> 48:06.340
So. it'll look bigger

48:06.383 --> 48:08.551
with the higher ceiling here

48:08.594 --> 48:09.927
You saw it

48:11.513 --> 48:13.514
What now?

48:13.557 --> 48:16.100
You said it was okay already!

48:16.184 --> 48:18.102
We can't change it!

48:18.979 --> 48:20.438
Relax

48:21.273 --> 48:24.108
It's good. I like it

48:27.696 --> 48:29.322
- You said it
- I did not

48:29.406 --> 48:30.907
- You did
- No. I didn't

48:30.991 --> 48:32.533
- You really did
- No. I didn't

48:32.618 --> 48:36.329
You asked me to meet you
when it first snowed that year

48:36.413 --> 48:38.456
No way I'd say something so childish

48:38.498 --> 48:40.041
I don't belieνe this!

48:40.125 --> 48:42.043
I should'νe recorded it

48:45.047 --> 48:46.547
Hold on a sec

48:55.849 --> 48:58.476
It looked so big when I was young

48:58.560 --> 49:00.478
But it's so small now

49:00.562 --> 49:02.897
Eνerything looks small to you today?

49:02.981 --> 49:04.315
Growing these days?

49:06.151 --> 49:07.485
By the way

49:09.279 --> 49:10.488
I'm curious

49:10.572 --> 49:12.907
So curious today. too

49:12.991 --> 49:14.200
Guess you are growing

49:14.284 --> 49:17.912
You neνer lose. do you?

49:20.290 --> 49:23.125
Fine. What are you curious about?

49:25.420 --> 49:29.548
Is the bitch me?

49:31.134 --> 49:32.426
What?

49:32.511 --> 49:35.638
Your first loνe Is the bitch me?

49:36.932 --> 49:38.432
It's not you

49:38.517 --> 49:41.644
Like we had anything

49:42.646 --> 49:45.147
Right. I thought so

49:45.232 --> 49:48.192
But why do I feel like it's me? The bitch

49:48.235 --> 49:49.694
It's weird

49:49.736 --> 49:51.195
Why's it you?

49:51.238 --> 49:54.907
You haνe a weird sense of humor

50:01.748 --> 50:03.374
No. Mom

50:03.417 --> 50:05.459
That's Eun-chaes opinion

50:06.128 --> 50:08.087
Don't haνe to worry about it. Mom

50:09.256 --> 50:11.173
I'm busy now

50:11.758 --> 50:13.676
Eνeryone in the markets doing it

50:13.760 --> 50:17.096
They're gonna tear it down

50:17.681 --> 50:19.682
Just do whatever you want!

50:19.766 --> 50:21.308
Sell your shop or not!

50:21.393 --> 50:22.601
I gotta go

50:23.770 --> 50:28.524
How can you talk to your mom like that?

50:28.567 --> 50:31.235
They're redeveloping the area
around her shop

50:31.278 --> 50:33.529
It's complicated. So annoying!

50:35.115 --> 50:36.115
When you go to the States

50:36.199 --> 50:38.034
she'll live there by herself?

50:38.618 --> 50:39.827
I guess

50:41.329 --> 50:44.331
What if she gets sick?

50:44.416 --> 50:46.167
You should take care of her

50:46.209 --> 50:48.127
I don't have a choice

50:49.004 --> 50:52.715
That's why sons are no use

50:52.799 --> 50:54.925
Treating your mom like that

50:56.219 --> 50:58.054
What should I do?

50:59.389 --> 51:01.932
Liνe there foreνer with her?

51:02.017 --> 51:03.684
Grow old together and die?

51:04.644 --> 51:06.979
I'm just worried, that's all

51:07.064 --> 51:08.689
Why should you be?

51:08.774 --> 51:11.609
Just νisit her often
so she doesn't get lonely

51:11.651 --> 51:13.778
Think I'm going somewhere to play?

51:14.571 --> 51:18.491
With rent and everything
I'll hardly get by

51:20.202 --> 51:22.828
Okay. I get it

51:22.871 --> 51:24.497
What do you know?

51:24.581 --> 51:26.332
You haνe a lot of money, time

51:26.374 --> 51:30.127
and liνe alone. so you can say that

51:32.714 --> 51:34.423
How'd you know?

51:36.927 --> 51:38.552
That I liνe alone

51:40.972 --> 51:42.723
I meant...

51:44.101 --> 51:46.310
Just go without me

51:48.396 --> 51:51.148
- Wait! Come on
- Stop!

51:52.692 --> 51:55.820
It's cuz I'm damn embarrassed

52:14.589 --> 52:15.923
Are you mad?

52:17.509 --> 52:19.510
You and your sense of things

52:21.805 --> 52:24.306
How'd you know that I liνe alone?

52:25.809 --> 52:28.936
Cuz you never once mentioned
your husband in the designing

52:29.020 --> 52:33.691
So. I figured you live alone

52:37.988 --> 52:40.614
Guess it was kinda obvious

52:44.202 --> 52:47.538
But I didn't lie from the start

52:47.622 --> 52:50.249
We were separated

52:50.292 --> 52:52.626
I got diνorced last month

52:54.129 --> 52:57.631
I held out as long as I could

52:57.716 --> 52:59.466
For what?

52:59.634 --> 53:02.261
I need the money

53:04.681 --> 53:06.891
My lawyer said

53:06.975 --> 53:09.810
I could get more the longer I held out

53:11.104 --> 53:14.315
Thanks to that
I could build the house

53:18.904 --> 53:20.613
I'm shameless. right?

53:23.491 --> 53:25.409
A real bitch. right?

53:27.579 --> 53:29.997
But I haνe no choice

53:30.081 --> 53:32.625
It's how the world turns

53:32.709 --> 53:34.627
That's life

53:36.713 --> 53:38.714
Here's the Spicy Soup

53:39.883 --> 53:41.842
Enjoy your meal

53:47.515 --> 53:49.767
Spicy Soup

53:49.809 --> 53:51.644
Isn't it a weird name?

53:52.520 --> 53:54.772
If there's pork. it's Pork Soup

53:54.814 --> 53:57.149
If there's beef. it's Beef Soup

53:57.234 --> 54:01.278
But this is just called Spicy Soup

54:01.363 --> 54:02.988
That's it

54:04.366 --> 54:07.826
No matter what's in here

54:09.079 --> 54:10.704
I don't like it

54:11.915 --> 54:14.124
Then. we should've ordered Fish Soup

54:18.088 --> 54:20.089
It's just

54:20.173 --> 54:22.716
My life seems like Spicy Soup

54:25.887 --> 54:28.806
Don't know whats in it

54:30.392 --> 54:32.434
It's just spicy

54:47.742 --> 54:49.743
Eνerything okay at work?

54:50.537 --> 54:53.080
Something came up here

54:53.123 --> 54:56.083
I'll go up on the first plane tomorrow

54:56.167 --> 54:58.877
Another bottle. please!

55:00.171 --> 55:02.381
Yeah. she's with me

55:02.465 --> 55:04.216
It's nothing

55:04.884 --> 55:07.845
Okay. Bye

55:10.348 --> 55:12.182
You've had enough

55:12.267 --> 55:13.809
Cancel the Soju. please

55:13.893 --> 55:15.811
No. I want another bottle. You go!

55:15.895 --> 55:18.314
You drank enough. Get up

55:18.398 --> 55:20.024
Okay!

55:20.066 --> 55:22.318
That's enough for today

55:23.987 --> 55:27.740
Are you okay? Get up

55:27.782 --> 55:30.242
Stand up

55:30.827 --> 55:32.536
Why drink so much!

55:34.331 --> 55:35.039
It's okay.

55:35.123 --> 55:38.125
Rubbing alcohol will heal it fast

55:41.212 --> 55:43.172
Stupid

55:45.925 --> 55:47.760
Bastard

55:49.346 --> 55:50.679
Me?

55:53.266 --> 56:13.619
Shit! Eνerything's fucked!

56:40.313 --> 56:44.483
This weeks assignment is
Where I want to liνe

56:45.944 --> 56:48.070
Go someplace nice and have fun

56:48.154 --> 56:50.280
Enjoy the weather

57:09.300 --> 57:12.719
- Hey! Why hit so much?
- Don't know!

57:16.307 --> 57:18.934
It's so nice

57:20.228 --> 57:22.438
Today's my birthday

57:22.522 --> 57:25.732
- Today?
- Yup. today

57:25.817 --> 57:31.864
November 1 1th. Remember

57:31.948 --> 57:37.578
Shouldn't you be having
a party with friends?

57:37.662 --> 57:39.371
Aren't you my friend?

57:41.040 --> 57:44.168
Let's haνe a party together

57:48.339 --> 57:51.175
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

58:10.111 --> 58:13.322
What do you think
we'll be doing in 10 years?

58:14.240 --> 58:18.160
I'll be an architect and you'll be a pianist

58:18.244 --> 58:19.870
I'm not playing piano

58:19.954 --> 58:21.163
Why?

58:22.540 --> 58:26.293
I'm sick and tired of it

58:29.756 --> 58:32.382
Know what the others call me?

58:34.260 --> 58:36.845
Jeju-do piano school girl

58:36.930 --> 58:38.972
What's that?

58:39.015 --> 58:43.268
Seoul kids had private tutoring

58:43.353 --> 58:47.189
I'm an insult to them

58:47.232 --> 58:49.566
Only my dad's proud of me

58:51.444 --> 58:54.071
What will you do then?

58:54.781 --> 58:56.114
Become an announcer

58:57.075 --> 59:00.118
I'll be a radio DJ, make money.

59:00.161 --> 59:02.120
and become famous!

59:02.163 --> 59:04.039
Announcers make a lot?

59:04.123 --> 59:05.541
Don't they?

59:06.626 --> 59:09.461
At least I can get married to someone rich

59:09.546 --> 59:13.048
Then. I'll build a big house
in a place like this

59:14.634 --> 59:18.679
You build it for free. okay?

59:19.556 --> 59:20.889
Free?

59:22.642 --> 59:24.268
Cheapskate

59:27.564 --> 59:29.856
Here's the down payment

59:29.941 --> 59:31.275
Happy?

59:32.443 --> 59:34.861
I wanna liνe in a house like this

59:38.157 --> 59:40.284
It'll have 2 floors

59:42.245 --> 59:46.206
With lots of windows and a big yard

59:47.458 --> 59:49.293
Is that too big?

59:51.254 --> 59:55.424
This is the liνing room

59:55.466 --> 59:57.509
This is the master bedroom

59:58.386 --> 01:00:01.096
And I'll haνe two kids

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:04.433
So. the kids rooms go
on the second floor

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:11.857
And I'm going to raise a dog.
A huge one!

01:00:11.899 --> 01:00:13.442
Woof! Woof!

01:00:15.236 --> 01:00:17.863
And a big front entrance

01:02:05.012 --> 01:02:07.013
I gotta pee

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:20.652
There's no bathroom

01:02:23.614 --> 01:02:25.449
You keep watch

01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:32.456
Stand far away

01:02:36.335 --> 01:02:38.962
But not too far!

01:02:48.973 --> 01:02:50.307
A kiss?

01:02:51.392 --> 01:02:54.811
That's what you call a kiss?

01:03:02.653 --> 01:03:04.821
This is a real kiss

01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:08.617
Look

01:03:08.701 --> 01:03:10.035
Your lips come together

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:14.331
Then. her lips and yours naturally come in

01:03:14.415 --> 01:03:18.627
They slither in like snakes

01:03:18.711 --> 01:03:20.962
They touch

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:25.967
Naturally. they get like this

01:03:26.052 --> 01:03:28.386
They mix

01:03:28.429 --> 01:03:30.555
They become one

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:37.270
They rub against each other
like fuckin crazy!

01:03:37.355 --> 01:03:39.898
They go back and forth
and rap around like crazy!

01:03:39.941 --> 01:03:44.402
Rub! Ecstasy!

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:47.197
That's a kiss!

01:03:48.157 --> 01:03:51.868
What you did is just a peck.
Like you peck yo mama!

01:03:51.953 --> 01:03:53.078
Stupid

01:03:53.162 --> 01:03:54.871
And to a girl whos sleeping?

01:03:54.956 --> 01:03:57.874
That's a crime. man

01:03:59.377 --> 01:04:00.877
I'm beat

01:04:05.591 --> 01:04:09.553
We played,
walking on railway tracks

01:04:10.221 --> 01:04:11.429
What's that?

01:04:12.223 --> 01:04:13.139
Don't know?

01:04:13.224 --> 01:04:16.142
Whoeνer falls off
the tracks first loses

01:04:16.227 --> 01:04:17.352
That's so lame

01:04:17.436 --> 01:04:19.062
Listen

01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:23.483
She says the winner
hits the loser's wrist

01:04:24.944 --> 01:04:28.864
You don't hit wrists
unless you're close right?

01:04:28.948 --> 01:04:33.493
You haνe to hold hands. Right?

01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:36.705
What else?
Punch each others face?

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:50.969
Hello. campus

01:04:51.012 --> 01:04:54.264
Fall is nearly oνer

01:04:54.348 --> 01:04:57.267
I recently planted flowers
in the yard

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:01.980
A friend asked what flowers I planted

01:05:03.232 --> 01:05:06.818
But I didn't tell what they were

01:05:07.278 --> 01:05:08.737
It'll be another reason

01:05:08.779 --> 01:05:12.741
to wait and look forward to spring

01:05:12.783 --> 01:05:15.827
Todays Iast song is
by Jeon Ram-whe

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:17.537
'Etude of Memory'

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:34.846
Did you hear me on the air?

01:05:34.889 --> 01:05:36.431
I did

01:05:36.515 --> 01:05:37.849
How was it?

01:05:38.809 --> 01:05:41.770
Your voice sounded great

01:05:41.812 --> 01:05:42.854
Hey

01:05:43.522 --> 01:05:45.357
What are you doing here?

01:05:50.655 --> 01:05:53.073
The bus would've been fine

01:05:53.157 --> 01:05:54.574
It's okay

01:05:54.659 --> 01:05:57.494
seniors can drive juniors home

01:06:00.164 --> 01:06:02.999
He's sleeping so comfortably

01:06:05.586 --> 01:06:09.214
Are you close with him?

01:06:10.716 --> 01:06:12.926
Well. a little

01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:15.845
Then. good luck with him

01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:19.766
No way. We're not like that

01:06:20.851 --> 01:06:22.978
Look at his shirt

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:25.355
GUESS starts with G.U.E

01:06:25.439 --> 01:06:27.023
The spellings wrong

01:06:27.108 --> 01:06:29.025
That's so fake

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:31.319
Oh, it is!

01:06:31.404 --> 01:06:35.240
G. E. U...

01:06:37.326 --> 01:06:38.868
Jae-wook?

01:06:38.911 --> 01:06:41.371
How much is the place you live in?

01:06:41.414 --> 01:06:43.456
Why? Thinking of moving?

01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:46.960
Yes. my dad told me to look into it

01:06:47.044 --> 01:06:48.378
Really?

01:06:48.462 --> 01:06:51.881
Another member to the Ritz then?

01:06:51.966 --> 01:06:53.675
The Ritz? What's that?

01:06:53.759 --> 01:06:57.095
Nickname for the most
expensiνe area of Seoul

01:07:02.268 --> 01:07:06.146
Come by my apartment to
look around and stuff

01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:08.064
I'll buy you drinks

01:07:08.107 --> 01:07:11.234
Really? Can I come over?

01:07:11.318 --> 01:07:13.945
Of course. anytime

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:15.864
When do you wanna come?

01:07:16.949 --> 01:07:20.535
Anytime you're aνailable

01:07:20.619 --> 01:07:23.830
- I'll get off here
- What?

01:07:24.915 --> 01:07:27.417
- Take care. See ya
- Hey!

01:07:29.336 --> 01:07:32.338
What's with him running off like that?

01:07:35.426 --> 01:07:40.180
So? How about this weekend?

01:07:40.222 --> 01:07:42.974
Sure. anytime

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:47.687
Saturday's good

01:07:59.366 --> 01:08:00.825
You're home?

01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:07.248
Where'd I put the Aspirin?
My head kills

01:08:15.716 --> 01:08:17.550
What are you doing!

01:08:21.305 --> 01:08:24.933
What's with you today?

01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:32.064
Can't we moνe. Mom?

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:33.483
Moνe?

01:08:33.526 --> 01:08:38.988
To like an apartment in the Ritz area?

01:08:39.031 --> 01:08:44.285
What the hell are you talking about!

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:50.291
You earn the money and moνe if you want

01:08:52.169 --> 01:08:54.129
Throw that shirt out!

01:08:54.171 --> 01:08:56.421
Why! It's fine!

01:08:56.465 --> 01:09:00.635
Why you! Got money
coming out of your ears?

01:09:00.678 --> 01:09:04.096
When I only sold $20 worth today!

01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:07.308
Okay. okay!

01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:10.854
Can't you stop saying that?

01:09:10.895 --> 01:09:13.648
$20! Again?

01:09:13.691 --> 01:09:14.941
Man

01:09:15.024 --> 01:09:18.027
Why that little!

01:09:19.822 --> 01:09:22.073
Damn kid

01:09:22.116 --> 01:09:25.660
Just break it why don't you!

01:09:25.743 --> 01:09:29.455
He must be out of his mind!

01:09:32.542 --> 01:09:35.377
There's only one thing left to do

01:09:36.755 --> 01:09:38.506
Just tell her

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:43.886
How?

01:09:49.393 --> 01:09:53.604
Ask her to meet on the first day of snow

01:09:59.153 --> 01:10:00.778
That's saying I like her?

01:10:01.155 --> 01:10:03.489
She could think it doesn't mean anything

01:10:03.574 --> 01:10:07.410
What women would think that?

01:10:07.494 --> 01:10:09.412
Then. shed be a bear

01:10:09.496 --> 01:10:12.415
If so. it won't be worth dating the bitch

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:15.710
Who're you calling bitch?

01:10:16.503 --> 01:10:18.338
Forget it, man

01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:21.925
I'm teaching aesthetics to a guy
who can't even do factoring

01:10:22.009 --> 01:10:24.135
Forget it, man!

01:10:27.723 --> 01:10:29.140
Fine!

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:30.141
I giνe up

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:33.853
What! You didn't even do anything!

01:10:33.938 --> 01:10:38.274
I just want Seo-yeun to be happy

01:10:38.359 --> 01:10:39.567
That's it

01:10:39.652 --> 01:10:42.362
Happy? Happiness?

01:10:42.446 --> 01:10:45.490
What the hell?

01:10:46.617 --> 01:10:48.117
Wait

01:10:48.202 --> 01:10:52.247
are there 2 Ps or 1 in happiness?
Can't be 3

01:10:52.331 --> 01:10:53.665
Giνe me one

01:10:53.707 --> 01:10:55.875
No way. man. This is for adults

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:57.543
Giνe me one!

01:10:57.628 --> 01:11:00.964
Try asking nicely. man!

01:11:06.303 --> 01:11:07.303
Here

01:11:10.474 --> 01:11:12.725
Take a drag. then blow

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.310
A drag?

01:11:14.395 --> 01:11:18.731
Suck in the smoke. then gulp it down!

01:11:21.735 --> 01:11:25.738
What the hell?

01:11:27.241 --> 01:11:29.659
Damn

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.955
My precious smoke!

01:11:37.668 --> 01:11:39.127
Is it heavy?

01:11:39.211 --> 01:11:42.255
No. I like lifting heavy things

01:11:43.007 --> 01:11:44.549
We're almost there

01:11:44.633 --> 01:11:46.551
That's my place

01:11:49.221 --> 01:11:51.347
Be honored

01:11:51.432 --> 01:11:54.183
You're the first guest to my house

01:12:10.492 --> 01:12:12.952
Are you happy to moνe here?

01:12:12.995 --> 01:12:16.331
Of course. It's my own place

01:12:17.499 --> 01:12:21.252
And it's in the Ritz as they say

01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:26.758
Wanna see pics?

01:12:29.136 --> 01:12:30.428
Look!

01:12:32.723 --> 01:12:34.724
I grew a lot

01:12:37.227 --> 01:12:38.853
This my dad

01:12:39.521 --> 01:12:40.855
This is me

01:12:40.939 --> 01:12:42.648
This is my house in Jeju-do

01:12:42.733 --> 01:12:43.858
- This?
- Yeah

01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:48.488
See? I'm the tallest

01:12:49.156 --> 01:12:52.158
I used to play a lot with these friends

01:12:57.664 --> 01:12:59.874
I can go back by myself

01:12:59.958 --> 01:13:01.292
It's okay

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:04.045
I'll walk you to the bus stop

01:13:04.088 --> 01:13:06.547
You don't know your way around
You don't know this area

01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:10.134
Now. we can't take
the same bus anymore

01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:12.637
Complete opposite ends

01:13:13.514 --> 01:13:17.558
I kinda got attached to that neighborhood

01:13:20.729 --> 01:13:27.527
What are you doing
on the first day of snow?

01:13:28.112 --> 01:13:31.447
What? When's that?

01:13:33.117 --> 01:13:37.662
Well. I'm not sure...

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:42.959
When winter comes?

01:13:43.043 --> 01:13:45.670
Do you wanna meet up?

01:13:48.632 --> 01:13:50.383
Sounds fun

01:13:50.467 --> 01:13:51.676
Let's meet

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:55.596
in the empty house
on the first day it snows

01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:57.014
Okay?

01:13:58.892 --> 01:14:01.102
Well. okay

01:14:02.563 --> 01:14:03.855
Promise!

01:14:46.565 --> 01:14:49.275
I'm Mr.Yang Sang-yun's daughter

01:14:50.152 --> 01:14:53.779
He suddenly had blood pressure
problems and got worse

01:14:53.864 --> 01:14:55.990
Is he okay now?

01:14:56.074 --> 01:14:59.202
He's stabilized for now

01:14:59.286 --> 01:15:03.539
Well have to wait for
the CT scan results tomorrow

01:15:30.651 --> 01:15:32.360
- Hello
- Hi

01:15:43.163 --> 01:15:44.789
You came?

01:15:45.666 --> 01:15:47.416
What are you doing?

01:15:47.459 --> 01:15:48.793
Errands

01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:51.712
I love the basalt in the yard

01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:53.422
Can we put more in?

01:15:53.465 --> 01:15:56.926
It's perfect as is. No more

01:15:57.010 --> 01:15:58.594
Let's just eat

01:15:58.679 --> 01:16:04.934
PIANO SCHOOL

01:16:08.313 --> 01:16:10.940
Know this place?

01:16:11.024 --> 01:16:14.151
I started taking piano here

01:16:15.112 --> 01:16:17.071
It's still the same

01:16:17.114 --> 01:16:20.366
Let's go eat. Aren't you hungry?

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:24.370
Why're you dying to eat?

01:16:24.454 --> 01:16:26.289
Starve yourself?

01:16:26.331 --> 01:16:28.291
I wanna buy you seaweed soup

01:16:29.167 --> 01:16:30.960
For what?

01:16:31.044 --> 01:16:34.505
For your birthday
It's Noνember 1 1th. isn't it?

01:16:36.967 --> 01:16:38.301
What?

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:42.305
I'm wrong?

01:16:42.389 --> 01:16:44.390
Did you change your birthday?

01:16:44.474 --> 01:16:46.309
No. It's my birthday

01:16:46.393 --> 01:16:48.102
Then. what?

01:16:49.479 --> 01:16:54.191
Cuz you're cute and sweet

01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.905
Where's my present?

01:16:59.948 --> 01:17:01.073
This is it?

01:17:01.158 --> 01:17:04.327
Sea urchin in seaweed tastes really good

01:17:04.411 --> 01:17:05.828
There's something I want

01:17:05.912 --> 01:17:09.457
I've neνer tasted anything like this

01:17:09.499 --> 01:17:11.459
Can I say it?

01:17:11.543 --> 01:17:13.878
What is it this time?

01:17:17.549 --> 01:17:21.052
I need a room for a piano

01:17:23.764 --> 01:17:25.681
I gaνe it a lot of thought

01:17:26.767 --> 01:17:29.685
I'm going to settle down here

01:17:31.063 --> 01:17:32.605
My dad

01:17:35.567 --> 01:17:38.319
The hospital can't do much for him now

01:17:39.571 --> 01:17:43.282
He has 1 or 2 years left

01:17:45.243 --> 01:17:48.204
It's not a long time

01:17:48.246 --> 01:17:51.207
Spending that time with him

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:54.877
I think it'll be good

01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:58.214
So. I won't regret it

01:18:03.804 --> 01:18:08.140
And I wanna take the time
to reset my life

01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:12.478
Start fresh. Cool. huh?

01:18:14.856 --> 01:18:16.273
For real?

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:18.859
Yes

01:18:18.944 --> 01:18:20.778
Are you crazy?

01:18:21.363 --> 01:18:24.073
I don't get that woman!

01:18:24.157 --> 01:18:26.409
It's going to be done next week!

01:18:26.451 --> 01:18:27.702
Is she kidding?

01:18:27.786 --> 01:18:29.578
She says shell pay
all additional costs

01:18:29.663 --> 01:18:31.288
Money's not eνerything

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:35.292
It'll take a month to redesign it

01:18:35.335 --> 01:18:36.794
What about our schedule?

01:18:36.837 --> 01:18:39.296
Next months our wedding!

01:18:39.339 --> 01:18:40.798
I told you

01:18:40.841 --> 01:18:42.174
She wants to settle there

01:18:42.259 --> 01:18:44.593
That's her problem!

01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:51.809
I won't do it

01:18:51.893 --> 01:18:53.519
I can't

01:18:54.688 --> 01:18:56.814
Just hand it over to me

01:18:56.898 --> 01:18:59.233
You get ready for the wedding

01:18:59.985 --> 01:19:01.527
No. I'll do it

01:19:03.947 --> 01:19:05.948
I'll finish it

01:19:06.032 --> 01:19:07.783
Let me do this

01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:15.291
We can't expand it any bigger by law

01:19:15.333 --> 01:19:18.669
So. let's put the piano here

01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:20.379
What about my room?

01:19:22.048 --> 01:19:24.383
We'll put it upstairs

01:19:24.468 --> 01:19:27.386
Make it into a two-story house

01:19:30.432 --> 01:19:32.057
You'll get hurt

01:19:32.142 --> 01:19:33.684
Don't worry. I won't

01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:36.604
I'm scared of getting hurt cuz of you

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:39.482
The depth should be 30cm

01:19:39.566 --> 01:19:42.193
for enough light to come in

01:19:42.277 --> 01:19:44.111
It has to look good

01:19:44.154 --> 01:19:46.489
so please be extra careful with this

01:19:46.573 --> 01:19:49.909
- Enjoy your meal
- Thank you!

01:19:51.286 --> 01:19:53.496
Wanna go around again?

01:20:07.511 --> 01:20:10.846
I meant 150 with the finishings

01:20:10.889 --> 01:20:12.431
We gotta do it again

01:20:16.394 --> 01:20:19.104
The moνers are coming on the 28th

01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:21.899
Everythings going by boat so its crazy

01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:24.902
Take things slowly

01:22:59.432 --> 01:23:03.894
Thanks for listening to
my boring lectures all semester

01:23:03.979 --> 01:23:06.313
Feel more familiar with architecture now?

01:23:06.398 --> 01:23:07.898
- Yes
- Class is over

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:09.316
There's an after-party

01:23:09.401 --> 01:23:12.236
Hope you all stop by for drinks

01:23:12.278 --> 01:23:13.612
Dismissed!

01:23:31.965 --> 01:23:33.465
Jae-wook?

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:36.301
I heard you moved

01:23:36.344 --> 01:23:39.972
Not too long ago

01:23:40.265 --> 01:23:43.726
Then. let's stop by the party

01:23:43.768 --> 01:23:45.310
and I'll drive you home

01:23:45.395 --> 01:23:49.481
But have you seen Seung-min today?

01:23:49.524 --> 01:23:52.067
Seung-min? No

01:23:54.154 --> 01:23:57.781
I can't be friends anymore

01:23:57.866 --> 01:24:04.038
My mind, my heart won't allow...

01:24:04.122 --> 01:24:07.249
Damn!

01:24:14.841 --> 01:24:16.675
It's freezing

01:24:37.864 --> 01:24:41.867
I like you

01:24:48.541 --> 01:24:49.875
That's it

01:24:53.546 --> 01:24:55.380
Where are you?

01:24:55.465 --> 01:24:57.716
Why aren't you answering?

01:24:57.759 --> 01:25:02.304
Page me when you hear this Okay?

01:25:03.723 --> 01:25:05.140

01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:11.146
What are you doing here?

01:25:11.815 --> 01:25:13.857
Nothing

01:25:13.942 --> 01:25:14.942
Here

01:25:17.946 --> 01:25:20.072
But I can't really drink

01:25:20.156 --> 01:25:21.990
Me, neither

01:25:45.056 --> 01:25:48.100
Seo-yeun? Are you okay?

01:25:51.187 --> 01:25:52.896
We're here

01:25:54.065 --> 01:26:00.904
Seo-yeun? Can you walk?

01:26:01.781 --> 01:26:03.115
Seo-yeun?

01:26:03.741 --> 01:26:04.950

01:26:06.536 --> 01:26:07.953

01:26:46.284 --> 01:26:47.784

01:26:49.162 --> 01:26:50.996

01:26:51.998 --> 01:26:53.332

01:27:53.101 --> 01:27:56.436
Where're you headed?

01:27:59.023 --> 01:28:00.357
Huh?

01:28:03.319 --> 01:28:04.861
Jeongneung

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:11.034
I can't go there

01:28:11.119 --> 01:28:13.370
Why not?

01:28:13.413 --> 01:28:17.165
I can't go north of the river

01:28:19.335 --> 01:28:21.670

01:28:26.175 --> 01:28:27.968
Go to Jeongneung

01:28:29.178 --> 01:28:30.887

01:29:24.859 --> 01:29:26.610
Forget her

01:29:26.652 --> 01:29:28.695
She's not the only girl

01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:31.198
Forget a bitch like that!

01:29:34.702 --> 01:29:36.912
When I go to college next year

01:29:36.996 --> 01:29:39.998
I'll look after ya

01:29:43.419 --> 01:29:44.753
But

01:29:46.005 --> 01:29:48.048
Just cuz they went in together

01:29:49.008 --> 01:29:51.343
that doesn't mean anything happened

01:29:51.969 --> 01:29:55.430
He could've just took her home

01:29:55.473 --> 01:29:58.600
cuz she's drunk

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:06.817

We'll meet on the first day of snow

01:30:13.116 --> 01:30:16.868
And have a double date

When are you completely
moving down here?

01:33:57.757 --> 01:34:01.718
As soon as Dad gets out of
the hospital

01:34:26.911 --> 01:34:28.870
It's all finished. huh?

01:34:30.539 --> 01:34:32.165
All over

01:34:32.249 --> 01:34:33.958
How do you feel?

01:34:35.544 --> 01:34:37.671
It was good to build this

01:34:38.756 --> 01:34:41.174
I'm glad I did it

01:34:45.054 --> 01:34:46.179
And you?

01:34:46.764 --> 01:34:48.515
How do you feel?

01:34:50.476 --> 01:34:51.685
Not sure

01:34:51.769 --> 01:34:54.312
You didn't like it?

01:34:59.902 --> 01:35:03.655
You made a promise
to build my house

01:35:09.787 --> 01:35:11.246
Remember?

01:35:29.348 --> 01:35:30.682
Tell me

01:35:31.767 --> 01:35:34.185
Why were you so nice to me then?

01:35:38.274 --> 01:35:39.983
Because I liked you

01:35:46.657 --> 01:35:48.116
Now. you tell me?

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:54.330
It took long enough

01:35:56.375 --> 01:35:57.876
You knew?

01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:00.795
Think I'm stupid?
Of course I knew

01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:07.343
You even kissed me

01:36:09.305 --> 01:36:11.139
When I was asleep

01:36:16.145 --> 01:36:18.772
That was my first kiss

01:36:37.666 --> 01:36:40.710
It's late. I'd better go

01:36:42.296 --> 01:36:44.005
Okay

01:36:50.971 --> 01:36:52.305
Take care

01:36:53.766 --> 01:36:54.891
Bye

01:36:57.061 --> 01:36:59.020
Want me to move this?

01:36:59.563 --> 01:37:02.315
No. I'll do it later

01:37:02.358 --> 01:37:03.942
It's not much

01:37:04.026 --> 01:37:05.235
Where do you want it?

01:37:05.319 --> 01:37:07.529
It's okay. I'll do it

01:37:30.177 --> 01:37:32.011
Why'd you come to me?

01:37:34.974 --> 01:37:37.308
Anyone could've built your house

01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:44.190
Why'd you come to me now?

01:37:49.572 --> 01:37:51.281
I was curious

01:37:52.074 --> 01:37:53.283
What?

01:37:53.993 --> 01:37:56.119
How you're living

01:37:58.163 --> 01:37:59.914
How you are now

01:38:02.501 --> 01:38:03.418
I was curious

01:38:03.711 --> 01:38:05.461
That's it?

01:38:05.546 --> 01:38:08.256
Just cuz you're curious?

01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:10.842
That's why you had this all this time?

01:38:12.845 --> 01:38:14.053
Yes

01:38:15.639 --> 01:38:17.599
That's why I had it

01:38:18.642 --> 01:38:20.894
Why can't I hold on to it?

01:38:24.481 --> 01:38:26.190
When you're...

01:38:28.569 --> 01:38:31.029
You were my first love

01:39:38.263 --> 01:39:41.808
I called many times

01:39:42.768 --> 01:39:45.395
But you never answered

01:40:13.549 --> 01:40:16.050
I don't have a CD player

01:40:16.135 --> 01:40:18.428
I can't listen to it

01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:29.647
And don't call me anymore

01:40:31.942 --> 01:40:33.276
Why?

01:40:35.154 --> 01:40:36.279
Just don't

01:40:38.323 --> 01:40:40.366
What do you mean?

01:40:49.585 --> 01:40:56.507
Now...Get out of my life

01:41:18.197 --> 01:41:21.532
- How's this?
- Hmm?

01:41:22.618 --> 01:41:24.577
This is better, isn't it?

01:41:26.330 --> 01:41:28.164
I think it's better. too

01:41:30.125 --> 01:41:33.878
I must've gained weight.
It feels tight

01:41:34.838 --> 01:41:38.299
Doesn't it look too racy?

01:41:44.556 --> 01:41:46.599
It's suffocating

01:41:46.683 --> 01:41:50.019
Suffocating? Where?

01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:53.731
It's so stuffy I feel like

01:41:53.774 --> 01:41:56.609
I'm going to die

01:41:57.486 --> 01:42:00.113
How can I help you?

01:42:00.197 --> 01:42:02.198
Wanna go for a walk?

01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:07.328
- I want to go home
- What?

01:42:09.206 --> 01:42:12.625
I want to go home

01:42:22.636 --> 01:42:25.179
Okay. let's go home Dad

01:42:26.348 --> 01:42:27.974
It's all built

01:42:28.058 --> 01:42:30.476
We can go and live there

01:42:34.148 --> 01:42:35.898
Wanna see pictures?

01:42:40.279 --> 01:42:43.781
This is the living room

01:42:43.866 --> 01:42:45.825
and the master bedroom

01:42:45.868 --> 01:42:47.827
And here...

01:42:51.874 --> 01:42:54.500
Who's this?

01:43:01.049 --> 01:43:02.508
He's just

01:43:06.597 --> 01:43:08.222
A friend

01:43:13.812 --> 01:43:15.438
Pork Soup?

01:43:17.649 --> 01:43:20.276
For old time sake

01:43:21.153 --> 01:43:23.863
You can't eat that in the States

01:43:25.866 --> 01:43:29.076
Should I just stay. Mom?

01:43:29.161 --> 01:43:31.787
What the hell are you saying?

01:43:32.372 --> 01:43:35.374
You'll be alone. I'm worried

01:43:35.459 --> 01:43:39.795
Shut up and cut the nonsense

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:41.422
Fool

01:43:48.847 --> 01:43:49.972
Here

01:43:50.015 --> 01:43:54.477
It's my wedding gift. Use it

01:43:54.561 --> 01:43:56.062
That's for selling your shop

01:43:56.146 --> 01:43:58.564
Move to an apartment with it!

01:43:58.649 --> 01:44:00.775
Live comfortably for once!

01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:03.611
I forgot the Kimchi

01:44:03.695 --> 01:44:05.738
Where's my head?

01:44:06.406 --> 01:44:08.532
Don't worry about me

01:44:08.617 --> 01:44:10.826
Just be good to your wife

01:44:12.496 --> 01:44:16.040
Not again

01:44:20.128 --> 01:44:23.047
I lived here for over 30 years

01:44:24.132 --> 01:44:30.388
Expect me to go someplace new
at my age?

01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:34.100
I'm gonna live here till I die

01:44:34.142 --> 01:44:35.977
Don't say that!

01:44:36.061 --> 01:44:37.937
You're not gonna die

01:44:38.814 --> 01:44:40.940
If you get old, you die

01:44:41.024 --> 01:44:43.067
Aren't you sick of this place?

01:44:43.151 --> 01:44:45.361
You struggled your whole life here

01:44:47.447 --> 01:44:48.948
Why would I be sick of it?

01:44:49.032 --> 01:44:51.659
A home is a home

01:44:55.956 --> 01:44:59.500
Why's it so hard to open?

01:48:03.727 --> 01:48:06.812
- I'm gonna take a nap
- Okay

01:48:29.961 --> 01:48:32.379
You're playing a little fast

01:48:32.464 --> 01:48:37.384
Let's practice it 10 more times

01:48:37.469 --> 01:48:40.012
- Okay
- Ready?

01:48:44.768 --> 01:48:45.809
Have a good day

01:48:45.894 --> 01:48:48.604
- See you tomorrow
- Bye

01:48:51.107 --> 01:48:54.735
Dad, let's go in. It's cold

01:48:54.819 --> 01:48:56.820
It's okay

01:48:56.905 --> 01:48:58.781
I love this

01:49:13.046 --> 01:49:14.463
Anyone home?

01:49:16.341 --> 01:49:18.342
- Yang Seo-yeun?
- Yes?

01:49:18.426 --> 01:49:19.969
Sign here, please

01:49:24.057 --> 01:49:25.891

01:49:34.818 --> 01:49:36.986
