00:29.520 --> 00:34.136
Mm. This place is starting
to look more like a...

00:34.160 --> 00:35.606
museum...

00:35.630 --> 00:37.606
than a storefront.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.540
Maybe we ought to start charging
admission, what do you think?

00:42.040 --> 00:44.100
- Maybe.
- Hm.

00:45.440 --> 00:46.510
All right.

00:52.850 --> 00:57.326
I'm gonna go stop by for
some coffee uh... Want some?

00:57.350 --> 00:59.150
Yeah. I'll take my usual.

05:28.420 --> 05:31.390
- I got five minutes.
- I won't be long.

05:38.970 --> 05:40.700
Why weren't you guys
at Dad's funeral?

06:29.450 --> 06:31.526
Can I still stay at the house?

06:31.550 --> 06:34.550
Claire, I'm not going
to kick you out.

06:36.260 --> 06:37.760
Are you keeping the shop open?

06:38.490 --> 06:40.890
- Yes.
- Do I still work there?

06:42.930 --> 06:44.130
Do you wanna work there?

06:44.970 --> 06:46.000
Yeah. Of course.

06:46.800 --> 06:47.830
Then, yes.

06:48.340 --> 06:49.500
That's fine.

06:51.410 --> 06:52.540
Are we done?

06:55.340 --> 06:56.410
Yeah, I'm done.

08:51.190 --> 08:52.530
Read this one before?

08:54.500 --> 08:55.630
Yeah.

08:56.760 --> 09:00.000
- How much is it?
- Two dollars.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.880
You wanna come out
with me tonight?

11:34.320 --> 11:36.766
- Claire?
- Oh, hey.

11:36.790 --> 11:39.236
- You made it.
- Yeah, yeah. I uh...

11:39.260 --> 11:41.460
I was just passing through,
thought I'd stop by.

11:43.830 --> 11:45.076
I brought your book.

11:45.100 --> 11:46.876
- You left it at the store.
- Oh, thanks.

11:46.900 --> 11:50.216
You... you really
didn't have to do that.

11:50.240 --> 11:53.246
I was passing through so,
you know, passing through.

11:53.270 --> 11:54.756
Yeah.

11:54.780 --> 11:56.410
You know what? You should stay.

11:57.040 --> 11:58.240
Um...

11:59.780 --> 12:02.750
- Yeah, I don't...
- Come on. Order a drink.

12:04.050 --> 12:07.320
Okay. Can I get a whiskey, neat?

12:19.630 --> 12:23.546
Oh, that's Vicki and Steve.

12:23.570 --> 12:28.070
They're here every week, same
time, doing the same thing.

12:28.540 --> 12:31.156
- Oh.
- Yeah.

12:47.160 --> 12:48.390
Come on.

12:50.830 --> 12:52.270
What's up, Check?

12:55.870 --> 12:59.246
Ended up with this sailboat

12:59.270 --> 13:03.440
that I bought on eBay when I
was drunk out of my mind.

13:04.580 --> 13:05.756
That cannot be true.

13:05.780 --> 13:09.826
Um. It's true. It's true.
Paton's honor.

13:11.620 --> 13:16.496
But like I always say, life is either
a daring adventure or nothing at all.

13:16.520 --> 13:17.766
You always say that?

13:17.790 --> 13:19.636
Did you come up with that?

13:19.660 --> 13:24.246
I always say it and... No. No.

13:24.270 --> 13:28.570
But... you know, whoever said
it, it's true, no matter what.

13:29.740 --> 13:31.000
Right.

18:46.020 --> 18:47.026
No.

18:49.160 --> 18:51.120
Please tell me you
took something.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.430
I didn't take anything.

18:55.230 --> 18:56.476
Gimme your hand.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.360
- Why?
- Just gimme your hand.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.340
Cross your eyes.

19:10.580 --> 19:11.580
Cross.

19:12.880 --> 19:13.910
Close your eyes.

19:15.120 --> 19:16.180
Open.

19:19.720 --> 19:20.790
Did I pass, officer?

19:22.190 --> 19:23.390
This isn't a joke.

20:27.050 --> 20:28.050
I'll be right back.

22:08.720 --> 22:09.720
Claire?

22:10.260 --> 22:12.890
Oh, I love those.

22:17.970 --> 22:19.000
Stay away from me, okay?

22:25.240 --> 22:27.610
Um, hey look, I...

22:28.610 --> 22:31.840
I'm just trying to
be a friend here.

22:37.890 --> 22:41.020
Uh... uh...

23:50.720 --> 23:51.860
$41.12

25:00.660 --> 25:01.990
Ay... hey

25:04.870 --> 25:06.070
Um... hm.

25:08.700 --> 25:10.540
I'm sorry to have
kept you waiting.

26:25.780 --> 26:27.150
What's at Graystone?

26:28.520 --> 26:29.720
It sounds spooky.

26:31.590 --> 26:32.720
I'm not crazy.

27:46.230 --> 27:47.230
What?

29:44.610 --> 29:47.486
All right, all right, all right.

29:47.510 --> 29:49.796
Favorite color on three.

29:49.820 --> 29:50.880
All right.

29:52.790 --> 29:54.850
One...

29:55.390 --> 29:56.390
Two...

29:57.660 --> 29:59.506
- Three.
- Paloma.

29:59.530 --> 30:01.360
What is Paloma?

30:06.870 --> 30:10.100
I don't know. I don't know.

31:42.200 --> 31:43.200
What?

31:46.030 --> 31:48.070
Nothing. I like it.

31:50.100 --> 31:51.540
I've never been anywhere.

31:52.970 --> 31:54.940
- Not even on a road trip?
- No.

31:55.210 --> 31:56.286
No?

31:56.310 --> 31:58.326
My parents traveled a lot before

31:58.350 --> 32:00.550
us kids came along and then...

32:03.150 --> 32:05.320
things got complicated.

32:09.790 --> 32:11.436
Is that because of Graystone?

32:13.290 --> 32:14.290
My turn.

32:16.430 --> 32:17.700
Why are you here?

32:21.100 --> 32:22.500
I followed you up here.

32:26.970 --> 32:31.016
Okay, that sounded a lot
less creepier in my head.

32:34.080 --> 32:35.210
Okay, my turn.

32:35.680 --> 32:36.680
Question two.

32:37.780 --> 32:39.150
What's Graystone?

32:44.920 --> 32:47.060
Place where you
send crazy people.

32:48.330 --> 32:49.460
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:50.900 --> 32:53.600
Are we gonna end up there?

33:55.130 --> 33:56.360
Hi, Claire.

33:57.630 --> 33:58.630
Hi.

33:59.130 --> 34:00.446
What's goin' on?

34:00.470 --> 34:03.040
I just needed to get
some of Dad's old files.

34:05.670 --> 34:08.409
Right. Everything
should be back here.

34:34.100 --> 34:35.716
What're you doing?

34:35.739 --> 34:38.746
Um... I'm trying to
fix this typewriter.

34:38.770 --> 34:39.770
I think I broke it.

34:43.639 --> 34:45.280
I like these drawings.

34:46.150 --> 34:48.350
Yeah? Me too.

34:49.179 --> 34:50.449
Is it your book?

34:51.520 --> 34:52.266
Sorta.

34:52.290 --> 34:53.750
If it your friend's book?

34:56.090 --> 34:57.496
Um...

34:57.520 --> 34:58.520
Is she here?

35:46.140 --> 35:47.246
What?

35:47.270 --> 35:49.270
I've got a couple
of offers already.

35:51.240 --> 35:52.840
You can't sell the shop.
It's Dad's.

35:54.980 --> 35:57.180
I can. He left it to me.

35:58.550 --> 36:00.620
Um, if you don't want
it, I can take it.

36:02.290 --> 36:04.920
You can't expect me
to do that, Claire.

36:06.960 --> 36:07.960
Why not?

36:11.700 --> 36:12.700
Come on, Lily.

38:37.110 --> 38:43.026
Well, you know that... I... I'm
going to need a new tailor. The...

38:43.050 --> 38:48.426
The clothes here... I... they just don't
seem to fit me they way I'm used to them.

38:48.450 --> 38:50.020
Nothing fits right.

38:51.360 --> 38:52.560
I think you look fine.

38:54.260 --> 38:57.530
Oh, well, thank you.

38:59.330 --> 39:01.500
And... where's Frank?

39:09.010 --> 39:10.010
Dad died.

39:10.480 --> 39:11.610
He had a stroke.

39:19.650 --> 39:21.720
Well, when is the funeral?

39:22.960 --> 39:24.020
It was last week.

39:26.660 --> 39:28.306
- Oh.
- I should've told you sooner.

39:28.330 --> 39:29.630
Sorry, I just...

39:30.300 --> 39:31.830
Was it a nice service?

39:34.670 --> 39:35.516
Yeah.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.476
Well, that's good.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.440
He was one of the good ones.

39:41.040 --> 39:46.080
He... used to have a box
filled with mementos... uh...

39:47.450 --> 39:49.656
Tickets to the theater...

39:49.680 --> 39:52.696
little notes we'd written
to each other...

39:52.720 --> 39:57.436
um... pictures of... places
we planned to visit.

39:57.460 --> 39:58.820
Things like that.

40:01.190 --> 40:04.500
He came every Sunday,
after Church, to see me.

40:49.140 --> 40:50.180
Okay.

41:59.880 --> 42:00.856
Hmm.

42:00.880 --> 42:03.426
Do you have anything
you'd want to pursue?

42:03.450 --> 42:05.056
No, should I?

42:05.080 --> 42:08.526
It's... totally up
to you, isn't it?

42:08.550 --> 42:10.836
It's not too late to
go back to college.

42:10.860 --> 42:14.506
Or maybe pursue a romantic
relationship with someone.

42:14.530 --> 42:15.706
Yeah.

42:15.730 --> 42:17.260
Like that's gonna happen.

42:20.200 --> 42:22.800
Well, um... how is Jo?

42:24.240 --> 42:25.900
- Still here?
- Hm.

42:27.170 --> 42:28.540
What have you been up to?

42:31.010 --> 42:32.240
Um, I saw my mom.

42:33.010 --> 42:34.010
Oh, did you?

42:35.680 --> 42:36.850
And how is she?

42:38.650 --> 42:40.326
She's good.

42:40.350 --> 42:41.990
What did you guys talk about?

45:25.520 --> 45:27.120
Is it the Fourth of July, today?

45:31.720 --> 45:33.020
Yeah. I think it is.

45:35.760 --> 45:38.930
You know uh... I've
never seen fireworks.

45:40.500 --> 45:41.500
What?

45:43.040 --> 45:44.040
Yeah.

45:45.440 --> 45:46.440
You wanna go?

45:47.270 --> 45:48.910
No. It's crowded.

45:49.580 --> 45:50.780
Don't be a weirdo.

45:51.640 --> 45:52.640
And hot.

45:54.110 --> 45:56.210
Oh... come on.

45:57.350 --> 45:58.820
Come on, Claire, please.

45:59.320 --> 46:00.820
Please, please.

46:01.490 --> 46:03.166
Please, please.

46:03.190 --> 46:04.196
Please, please.

46:04.220 --> 46:06.636
Please, please. Claire, come on.
Please, please.

46:06.660 --> 46:08.190
Okay, okay, okay, we'll go.

46:08.860 --> 46:10.330
- Really?
- Yes, really.

46:11.460 --> 46:12.506
- Yes?
- Yes.

46:12.530 --> 46:13.770
- Yes?
- Yes.

46:26.150 --> 46:27.480
Should've brought flowers.

47:18.530 --> 47:20.460
Oh, God.

47:26.010 --> 47:27.886
Somebody's excited.

47:27.910 --> 47:30.070
Yes. Yes, I am.

47:34.310 --> 47:35.580
You know what?

47:36.420 --> 47:37.480
Just do this.

47:48.830 --> 47:50.630
Yeah. That's it.

47:56.700 --> 47:58.416
- Hi.
- Hey.

47:58.440 --> 48:00.286
I've a huge favor to ask.

48:00.310 --> 48:01.486
- Oh, no.
- Okay.

48:01.510 --> 48:02.586
Can you watch Lily?

48:02.610 --> 48:05.616
- No, we're going out.
- I can't. I have plans.

48:05.640 --> 48:07.056
It'll only be for an hour, so...

48:07.080 --> 48:08.856
No, I don't think
that'll be a good idea.

48:08.880 --> 48:11.880
I got called in to work for an emergency
and Angie's at the restaurant.

48:16.390 --> 48:17.496
This is not happening.

48:17.520 --> 48:19.806
I'm s... s... sorry. Maybe
you should go home...

48:19.830 --> 48:20.936
All right. I'll do it.

48:20.960 --> 48:22.006
Thank you.

48:22.030 --> 48:23.336
- Does Angie know?
- Claire!

48:23.360 --> 48:25.976
Of course. I'll be back soon.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.700
I want you to behave
for your Aunt, okay?

48:28.500 --> 48:29.500
Thanks.

48:33.070 --> 48:36.116
How you play is, if
someone has a six

48:36.140 --> 48:39.386
and they have... or
they have another card

48:39.410 --> 48:40.856
If someone lays down,

48:40.880 --> 48:43.556
they could take that card
and give it to someone

48:43.580 --> 48:47.626
and then, if they don't have
it, they have to go fish.

48:47.650 --> 48:48.826
So, what card do you have?

48:48.850 --> 48:51.866
Like, if you had a six,
you could give it to me.

48:51.890 --> 48:54.766
A six? I don't have a six.

48:54.790 --> 48:56.490
- Then, I'll go fish.
- Oh.

48:57.330 --> 48:59.560
Okay, game's over. Let's go.

49:00.270 --> 49:02.716
Jo, you know we can't go.

49:02.740 --> 49:04.216
Where were you going to go?

49:04.240 --> 49:06.886
Going to the
fireworks' festival.

49:06.910 --> 49:08.570
Have you ever seen
the fireworks?

49:09.540 --> 49:11.416
Oh, so Claire...

49:11.440 --> 49:15.086
Claire, seriously, why don't we go?
Lily, would love to go.

49:15.110 --> 49:17.720
We can go. We can go and have fun.
Come on.

49:18.650 --> 49:20.320
Who can say no to these faces?

52:58.140 --> 53:00.316
Where were you? You okay?

53:00.340 --> 53:01.786
Where were you?

53:01.810 --> 53:03.416
I went to see the fireworks.

53:03.440 --> 53:05.116
Oh, that's not right.

53:05.140 --> 53:07.910
Get in the car, please.

53:08.410 --> 53:09.610
Take her to the car.

53:17.120 --> 53:18.490
Look, I'm sorry.

53:19.120 --> 53:20.590
Told Rich I had plans.

53:26.300 --> 53:28.830
How could... how
could you do this?

54:17.680 --> 54:20.850
Did it not even cross your mind
that you might be dangerous?

54:24.590 --> 54:25.590
What?

54:26.890 --> 54:29.066
You of all people...

54:29.090 --> 54:30.490
you should know...

54:32.560 --> 54:34.630
we grew up in the same house.

54:35.800 --> 54:37.676
It's not like that.

54:37.700 --> 54:40.740
And you can act like
this is because of Jo?

54:41.470 --> 54:43.916
Because you left years ago.

54:43.940 --> 54:45.686
What did Dad do to deserve that?

54:45.710 --> 54:46.910
He was selfish.

54:48.010 --> 54:49.426
He was selfish.

54:49.450 --> 54:52.656
He was in the same imaginary
world as the rest of you.

54:52.680 --> 54:55.750
And she almost died
because of it.

54:57.090 --> 54:59.060
I found Mom, Claire.

55:01.060 --> 55:02.936
Before it was too late.

55:02.960 --> 55:04.960
I found her. Not Dad.

55:08.800 --> 55:12.400
I do not want that to
happen to my little girl.

55:20.810 --> 55:21.810
I'm not Mom.

55:23.150 --> 55:24.550
Yes, you are.

55:25.850 --> 55:26.850
Yes, you are.

56:52.240 --> 56:53.986
I don't wanna leave
my kids away.

56:54.010 --> 56:56.686
I've never seen you before.
Get out of here.

56:56.710 --> 56:58.256
No, no.

56:59.340 --> 57:01.410
Ah. Oh, no. No. Aah.

58:04.140 --> 58:05.710
I didn't want...

58:06.910 --> 58:07.950
Jo, go away.

58:09.580 --> 58:10.780
Jo, please.

58:15.020 --> 58:16.020
Please get out.

58:19.420 --> 58:20.490
Okay.

58:25.760 --> 58:26.760
Okay.

59:22.690 --> 59:24.560
Shit.

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:42.270
How are you feeling, Claire?

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:48.970
Has anything changed
since we last spoke?

01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:04.406
The buyers were hesitant and...

01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:07.390
they were talking about turning it into
something other than a bookstore...

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:10.846
which I didn't like.

01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:12.316
So...

01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:14.986
I thought maybe it's
time for a change.

01:05:15.010 --> 01:05:16.616
I could get out of the
restaurant business.

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.280
Be my own boss.

01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:21.680
And we could spend
more time together.

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:32.090
At least until we get the
logistics sorted out.

01:05:34.590 --> 01:05:36.506
Maybe in the meantime, we...

01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:39.776
try to keep you from
breaking anything.

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:43.606
I made out a little 'do not touch'
sign for the... typewriter.

01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:49.170
Just kidding.

01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:56.750
Are we okay?

01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:03.120
Yeah, we're okay.

01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:07.266
Great.

01:06:07.290 --> 01:06:08.730
So I'll see you
at the bookstore.

01:06:09.530 --> 01:06:10.530
Yeah.

01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:17.230
Okay.
