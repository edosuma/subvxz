00:02.203 --> 00:03.274
THAT'S IT, FRAN.
ONE MORE PUSH.

00:03.274 --> 00:05.106
(Meredith)
AS BABIES, WE WERE EASY.

00:05.106 --> 00:07.038
ONE CRY
MEANT YOU WERE HUNGRY...

00:07.038 --> 00:09.009
(baby crying)
IT'S A BOY.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.011
HOW IS HE? IS HE OKAY?

00:11.011 --> 00:12.243
ANOTHER, YOU WERE TIRED.

00:12.243 --> 00:14.185
HE'S PERFECT.

00:14.185 --> 00:17.118
(continues crying)

00:17.118 --> 00:20.221
(Washington's "Holy Moses"
playing)

00:20.221 --> 00:24.095
♪ HEY, HOW WE BREATHE
AND HOW WE CHOKE ♪

00:24.095 --> 00:28.028
IT'S ONLY AS ADULTS
THAT WE BECOME DIFFICULT.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.131
HEY, WAKE UP,
PRETTY LADY.

00:30.131 --> 00:33.104
MM. (laughs)

00:33.104 --> 00:34.205
MORNING.

00:34.205 --> 00:36.137
(Mark) IT'S GONNA BE
A GREAT MORNING.

00:36.137 --> 00:38.109
WE MADE YOU
EGGS BENEDICT.

00:38.109 --> 00:39.240
WHERE'S SOFIA?

00:39.240 --> 00:41.242
NAPPING.
OOH. TRY THE EGGS.

00:41.242 --> 00:43.314
THE--THE BACON
IS JALAPENO-INFUSED.

00:43.314 --> 00:44.315
TOMORROW WE'RE MAKING

00:44.315 --> 00:46.317
SHORT RIBS
INFUSED WITH CABERNET.

00:46.317 --> 00:48.379
I JUST WANT COFFEE
INFUSED WITH CREAM.

00:48.379 --> 00:50.081
NO, YEAH, BUT JUST TRY
THE HOLLANDAISE.

00:50.081 --> 00:51.382
I-I HAVE TO GET READY.
I HAVE A BIG SURGERY--

00:51.382 --> 00:53.154
HOLD ON.
SO I--AAH.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.155
OOH.
MMM.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.256
I'M SO SORRY.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.228
MMM.
WE START TO HIDE
OUR FEELINGS,

00:57.228 --> 00:58.429
PUT UP WALLS.

00:58.429 --> 01:01.192
♪ LEAVE IT ALONE ♪

01:01.192 --> 01:03.364
♪ LEAVE IT ALONE ♪

01:03.364 --> 01:05.136
♪ I KNOW YOU'RE DANGEROUS ♪

01:05.136 --> 01:07.268
IT GETS TO THE POINT WHERE
WE NEVER REALLY KNOW

01:07.268 --> 01:08.439
HOW ANYONE THINKS OR FEELS.

01:08.439 --> 01:09.440
WHAT?

01:09.440 --> 01:10.441
MY KEY'S NOT WORKING.

01:10.441 --> 01:12.143
YES, BECAUSE I CHANGED
THE LOCKS.

01:12.143 --> 01:13.144
OH, COME ON!

01:13.144 --> 01:14.345
YES, THIS ISN'T MY TRIAL,

01:14.345 --> 01:16.247
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN
LOCK ME OUT OF MY OWN MOUSE LAB.

01:16.247 --> 01:17.378
MYMOUSE LAB.

01:17.378 --> 01:19.350
BAILEY, DON'T--

01:19.350 --> 01:23.184
WITHOUT MEANING TO,
WE BECOME MASTERS OF DISGUISE.

01:24.285 --> 01:26.217
(April) Q's HYPERGLYCEMIC, TOO.

01:26.217 --> 01:27.218
WHAT?

01:27.218 --> 01:28.359
(sighs)

01:28.359 --> 01:30.361
WHICH MEANS THAT ABOUT 20%
OF THE MICE WITH IMPLANTS

01:30.361 --> 01:32.163
HAVE DIABETES AGAIN.

01:32.163 --> 01:34.225
LOOK, WE--WE SHOULD REALLY
TELL DR. WEBBER.

01:34.225 --> 01:35.226
NO, WE ARE NOT TELLING HIM.

01:35.226 --> 01:36.367
WELL, OKAY, BUT, UM--

01:36.367 --> 01:39.099
KEPNER, IT IS PRECISELY
BECAUSE OF CHALLENGES LIKE THIS

01:39.099 --> 01:41.272
THAT I HANDPICKED YOU
FOR THIS TRIAL.

01:41.272 --> 01:42.473
YOU HANDPICKED ME BECAUSE

01:42.473 --> 01:44.305
CRISTINA, ALEX, AND JACKSON
ALL SAID NO.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.307
AND BECAUSE YOU GO
ABOVE AND BEYOND.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.309
LOOK, YOU SOLVE PROBLEMS
LIKE NO ONE ELSE CAN.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.480
SAY IT WITH ME.

01:49.480 --> 01:51.482
I SOLVE PROBLEMS...

01:51.482 --> 01:53.344
LIKE--LIKE NO ONE ELSE CAN.
LIKE NO ONE ELSE CAN.

01:53.344 --> 01:56.116
EXACTLY.
NOW LET'S GET TO WORK.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.318
(Owen) FIFTH YEAR

01:57.318 --> 01:59.190
IS THE HARDEST YEAR
OF YOUR RESIDENCY.

01:59.190 --> 02:01.252
EVERY SURGERY YOU DO
WILL GO ON YOUR RECORD,

02:01.252 --> 02:03.254
THE WINS AND THE LOSSES.

02:03.254 --> 02:04.355
IN JUST A FEW MONTHS,
YOU WILL...

02:04.355 --> 02:06.157
(lowered voice)
WHAT DID I MISS?

02:06.157 --> 02:07.328
(lowered voice)
YOU'RE O.B. NOW?

02:07.328 --> 02:09.330
(chuckles) OH, HOW THE MIGHTY
HAVE FALLEN, HUH?

02:09.330 --> 02:12.203
(lowered voice) SHE MISSES ZOLA.
HER UTERUS HURTS.

02:12.203 --> 02:14.265
OH, LEAVE HER ALONE,
DIRTBAG.

02:14.265 --> 02:15.336
...OF THE MORE COMPLICATED
SURGERIES YOU'VE SCRUBBED IN.

02:15.336 --> 02:16.407
(whispers)
YOU ARE EMBARRASSING ME.

02:16.407 --> 02:18.239
I'M GETTING
TO DELIVER BABIES.

02:18.239 --> 02:19.240
I'M MAKING LIFE,
YOU KNOW?

02:19.240 --> 02:20.241
(lowered voice)
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:20.241 --> 02:22.343
YOU'RE MAKING ME GAG.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.245
OKAY, SLUMMING IT IN O.B.
FOR A FEW WEEKS IS OKAY.
DESCRIBE HOW YOU OVERCAME
CERTAIN CHALLENGES...

02:24.245 --> 02:25.376
WHATEVER.
SOLVED PROBLEMS,
MANAGED YOUR TEAM.

02:25.376 --> 02:28.279
WEARING THE VAGINA SQUAD SCRUBS
IN PUBLIC?

02:28.279 --> 02:30.150
DON'T WAIT TO DO THIS.
YOU'LL REGRET IT LATER.
IT'S--UGH.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.352
(whispers)
WE HAVE STANDARDS, MEREDITH.

02:31.352 --> 02:33.384
(Owen) IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
THAT YOU RACK UP

02:33.384 --> 02:37.157
AS MANY GOOD OUTCOMES
AS POSSIBLE FOR YOUR BOARDS.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.289
I AM IMPLEMENTING A SYSTEM.

02:38.289 --> 02:40.491
I WILL RECEIVE AN E-MAIL
IF ANY OF YOU EXCEED

02:40.491 --> 02:43.494
MORE THAN TEN BAD OUTCOMES
IN YOUR O.R.

02:43.494 --> 02:45.366
TEN--ANY MORE IS UNACCEPTABLE.

02:45.366 --> 02:47.167
WELCOME, DR. KEPNER.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.539
SORRY. I GOT STUCK
IN THE LAB WITH BAILEY.

02:48.539 --> 02:50.241
(tablet beeps)
I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU WERE.

02:50.241 --> 02:52.243
I CARE THAT YOU
ALREADY HAVE, LET'S SEE...

02:52.243 --> 02:54.445
(beep)
UH, TWO BAD OUTCOMES
IN YOUR O.R.

02:54.445 --> 02:55.446
(residents) OOH.

02:55.446 --> 02:57.308
LOSER.

02:57.308 --> 02:59.210
OF COURSE THAT'S NOTHING

02:59.210 --> 03:02.483
COMPARED TO KAREV'S
IMPRESSIVE FIVE BAD OUTCOMES.

03:02.483 --> 03:03.484
OH! (laughs)

03:03.484 --> 03:04.485
I KEEP GETTING DUD PATIENTS.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.186
TELL IT TO
YOUR BOARD EXAMINERS.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.318
THE POINT, PEOPLE,

03:07.318 --> 03:10.261
IS TO KEEP YOUR BAD OUTCOMES
TO A MINIMUM,

03:10.261 --> 03:13.464
OR YOU WILL BE HARD-PRESSED
TO FIND A FELLOWSHIP NEXT YEAR.

03:13.464 --> 03:15.195
(whispers)
WHO ARE YOU TEXTING?

03:15.195 --> 03:16.427
WHO DO YOU THINK?

03:16.427 --> 03:17.528
(cell phone chimes)

03:19.530 --> 03:21.272
UH, DR. YANG,

03:21.272 --> 03:24.235
ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU'RE
GETTING ALL THIS DOWN?

03:24.235 --> 03:25.336
MM-HMM.

03:25.336 --> 03:27.408
BAD OUTCOMES ARE BAD,

03:27.408 --> 03:29.340
WHICH IS WHY I HAVE ZERO
SO FAR,

03:29.340 --> 03:31.211
A PERFECT RECORD
I PLAN TO CONTINUE

03:31.211 --> 03:32.543
DURING MY ORTHO ROTATION
THIS WEEK.

03:32.543 --> 03:35.416
NO ONE DIES
DURING A HIP REPLACEMENT.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.417
LET'S HOPE.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.289
(Lexie) I'M SORRY.

03:38.289 --> 03:39.420
MM-HMM.
I WILL MAKE SURE
THAT THE SCRUB NURSE

03:39.420 --> 03:40.591
SEPARATES YOUR MACRODISSECTORS
FROM YOUR MICROS.

03:40.591 --> 03:43.294
I TOLD HER THAT YESTERDAY,
BUT SHE MUST HAVE FORGOTTEN,

03:43.294 --> 03:45.456
WHICH I KNOW SOUNDS LIKE
AN EXCUSE,

03:45.456 --> 03:46.557
AND I AM SORRY
FOR THAT TOO--

03:46.557 --> 03:47.558
(clears throat) LEXIE.
YES.

03:47.558 --> 03:49.430
LEAVE. NOW.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.501
OKAY.

03:50.501 --> 03:52.563
(sighs)

03:52.563 --> 03:55.506
HEY. CAN YOU GO HAVE SEX
WITH HIM AND MAKE HIM BE NICER?

03:55.506 --> 03:57.408
I TOLD YOU, HE'S GOING TO BE
HARD ON YOU

03:57.408 --> 03:59.310
UNTIL YOU LEARN
ALL OF HIS QUIRKS.

03:59.310 --> 04:00.411
THEY'RE NOT QUIRKS.

04:00.411 --> 04:02.273
THEY'RE THESE SCARY,
NITPICKY RULES...

04:02.273 --> 04:03.444
(whispers)
JUST TO DRIVE ME CRAZY.

04:03.444 --> 04:04.515
(laughs)
(normal voice)
LIKE WHAT IS THE DEAL

04:04.515 --> 04:06.347
WITH HIM NEEDING 16 TOWELS
IN THE O.R.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.448
AT ALL TIMES?

04:07.448 --> 04:08.519
WELL, IF I GIVE YOU
ALL THE ANSWERS,

04:08.519 --> 04:10.321
YOU'LL NEVER LEARN
ON YOUR OWN.

04:10.321 --> 04:12.483
YOU'RE JUST AS MEAN
AS HE IS.
(elevator bell dings)

04:12.483 --> 04:13.484
(laughs)

04:13.484 --> 04:14.585
HI. HOW'S YOUR DAY GOING?

04:14.585 --> 04:17.257
BAD.
MY O.R. IS A MESS,

04:17.257 --> 04:19.360
MY CASELOAD IS AN EXERCISE
IN BORING.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.561
WHICH YOU CAN'T TELL ME

04:20.561 --> 04:22.463
BECAUSE WE CAN'T TALK
ABOUT NEURO.

04:22.463 --> 04:23.634
RIGHT.

04:23.634 --> 04:26.467
I KNOW SOMETHING ELSE
WE CAN DO INSTEAD.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.399
NO KISSING
IN THE HOSPITAL.

04:28.399 --> 04:29.600
WHY NOT?

04:29.600 --> 04:31.372
WE DON'T WORK TOGETHER
ANYMORE.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.503
(laughs)
YOU'RE JUST MY WIFE.

04:32.503 --> 04:34.405
(pager beeps)
OOH.

04:34.405 --> 04:35.546
9-1-1.

04:35.546 --> 04:37.277
WAIT.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.379
OKAY. NOW YOU CAN GO.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.550
(indistinct conversations)

04:39.550 --> 04:41.352
(cell phone chimes)

04:41.352 --> 04:42.513
(sighs)
I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL

04:42.513 --> 04:44.284
THAT THEY'RE GETTING ALONG,
RIGHT?

04:44.284 --> 04:45.616
BUT I'M NOT, THOUGH.
I'M BITTER.

04:45.616 --> 04:47.518
ALL THEY DO
IS COOK TOGETHER

04:47.518 --> 04:49.390
AND TALK ABOUT FOOD
AND WATCH SHOWS

04:49.390 --> 04:51.592
WHERE OTHER PEOPLE
TALK ABOUT FOOD AND...

04:51.592 --> 04:53.564
(indistinct conversations)

04:53.564 --> 04:55.295
UH, DON'T--DON'T READ THAT.
"I'LL BEND YOU OVER

04:55.295 --> 04:56.597
THE CONFERENCE ROOM TABLE
AND"--OH!

04:56.597 --> 04:58.529
OKAY, WHY DID YOU LET ME
READ THAT?

04:58.529 --> 04:59.600
MY HUSBAND CAN'T GET
ENOUGH OF ME.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.372
JEALOUS?

05:01.372 --> 05:02.573
YES, ACTUALLY.

05:02.573 --> 05:05.406
ARIZONA AND I HAVEN'T HAD
MUCH "ALONETIME" LATELY,

05:05.406 --> 05:06.607
AND SO INSTEAD, WE EAT.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.339
OH, THAT'S DEPRESSING.

05:08.339 --> 05:09.440
YEAH, LET'S JUST TALK
ABOUT THE CASE. (chuckles)

05:09.440 --> 05:10.481
OKAY. WHAT IS IT?

05:10.481 --> 05:11.512
OKAY.

05:11.512 --> 05:12.643
HIP REPLACEMENT,
SHOULDER DISLOCATION?

05:12.643 --> 05:14.685
(chuckles) THIS IS YOUR FIRST
TIME COPILOTING WITH ME.

05:14.685 --> 05:16.687
YOU THINK I'M GONNA BORE YOU
WITH ROUTINE CRAP?

05:22.322 --> 05:23.624
MR. AND MRS. MOSER? HI.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.496
HI. SORRY.

05:25.496 --> 05:28.499
MY, UH, LAZY SACK HUSBAND
THINKS THAT THIS IS HIS BED.

05:28.499 --> 05:29.630
OH, IT'S--IT'S NOT?

05:29.630 --> 05:31.432
NO, THIS IS
OUR PATIENT'S PARENTS.
YEAH.

05:31.432 --> 05:32.663
THIS IS DR. YANG. SHE'S MY
CO-SURGEON ON THE CASE.

05:32.663 --> 05:34.705
OH,
SO NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:34.705 --> 05:36.507
(exhales)

05:36.507 --> 05:37.638
GET UP!

05:37.638 --> 05:39.540
COME ON. PRETEND YOU HAVE
MANNERS FOR A SECOND.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.341
WHAT, THE KIND OF MANNERS
THAT ALLOW YOU

05:41.341 --> 05:42.673
TO INSULT YOUR HUSBAND
IN FRONT OF STRANGERS?
STOP IT.

05:42.673 --> 05:44.615
(man) STOP FIGHTING.

05:44.615 --> 05:46.677
YOU'RE SCARING THE DOCTORS.

05:46.677 --> 05:48.519
HI. TYLER.

05:48.519 --> 05:50.481
I'M, UH, I'M NOT STARING
AT YOUR BOOBS.

05:50.481 --> 05:53.424
I MEAN, I-I AM,
BUT I-I CAN'T HELP IT.

05:53.424 --> 05:54.485
(both laugh)

05:54.485 --> 05:56.356
(chuckles)
TYLER SUFFERS FROM

05:56.356 --> 05:58.589
A DEGENERATIVE BONE DISEASE
CALLED CERVICAL SPONDYLOSIS.

05:58.589 --> 06:00.591
HE WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT
TWO YEARS AGO,

06:00.591 --> 06:02.633
WHICH FURTHER INJURED
HIS NECK,

06:02.633 --> 06:04.435
AND SO WE ARE GONNA
BUILD HIM A NEW ONE

06:04.435 --> 06:05.696
IN A 3-DAY, 3-PART SURGERY.

06:05.696 --> 06:06.697
MM.

06:06.697 --> 06:08.699
DO NOT POINT
THAT CAMERA AT ME!

06:08.699 --> 06:10.370
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL,
SWEETIE.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.572
(groans)

06:11.572 --> 06:14.545
OH, ARE YOU THE O.B.?
DRUGS, PLEASE.

06:14.545 --> 06:16.647
WHERE'S THE ATTENDING?
SHE'S STUCK
IN AN EMERGENCY C.

06:16.647 --> 06:17.678
THEY WERE DRIVING HOME
TO OLYMPIA WHEN HER WATER BROKE.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.510
(groans)
SHE'S TWO WEEKS EARLY.

06:19.510 --> 06:20.651
HI, MARY. I'M DR. GREY.

06:20.651 --> 06:22.453
OH, I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE,
JUST GIVE ME DRUGS.

06:22.453 --> 06:24.384
OKAY, LET'S SEE IF WE HAVE
TIME FOR THAT.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.586
OVER HERE, HONEY.
WOW. YOU'RE CROWNING.

06:25.586 --> 06:26.717
OH. WOW?

06:26.717 --> 06:28.459
DID YOU JUST SAY "WOW"?

06:28.459 --> 06:30.421
THIS--THIS IS IT.
IT'S ALL HAPPENING.

06:30.421 --> 06:31.722
OHH. CLAY, I SWEAR TO GOD,

06:31.722 --> 06:34.565
IF YOU DON'T POINT THAT CAMERA
SOMEPLACE ELSE!

06:34.565 --> 06:36.597
OH, GOD!

06:36.597 --> 06:38.429
ARE--ARE YOU PUSHING?
SHE SHOULDN'T PUSH, RIGHT?

06:38.429 --> 06:39.470
JUST GIVE ME A SECOND.

06:39.470 --> 06:40.631
LOOK OVER HERE.
I'LL DISTRACT YOU.

06:40.631 --> 06:41.732
BRAIN TUMOR!

06:41.732 --> 06:42.733
BRAIN TUMOR.

06:42.733 --> 06:44.705
I CALL BRAIN TUMOR
ON THE VIDEO CAMERA!

06:44.705 --> 06:46.607
YOU CAN'T CALL BRAIN TUMOR
RIGHT NOW.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.679
IT'S MY TUMOR.
I MAKE THE RULES.

06:48.679 --> 06:50.541
BRAIN TUMOR?
NOBODY SAID ANYTHING.

06:50.541 --> 06:51.742
SHE HAS
A GRADE IV ASTROCYTOMA.

06:51.742 --> 06:52.743
YOU COULDA LED
WITH THAT.

06:52.743 --> 06:54.485
IT'S BEEN A LITTLE HECTIC.

06:54.485 --> 06:55.646
AAH!

06:55.646 --> 06:58.449
OHH!

06:58.449 --> 06:59.490
HEAD.

06:59.490 --> 07:09.760
AAH!

07:14.134 --> 07:17.137
HI, EMMA.

07:17.137 --> 07:19.009
SWEET LITTLE GIRL.

07:19.009 --> 07:20.471
IT'S CALLED
A BUTTERFLY TUMOR

07:20.471 --> 07:22.172
BECAUSE IT EXTENDS INTO
BOTH SIDES OF THE BRAIN.

07:22.172 --> 07:23.944
SHE HAS ABOUT SIX MONTHS.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.976
SHE'S DYING, SO THEY DECIDED
TO HAVE A BABY?

07:25.976 --> 07:27.117
WELL, THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

07:27.117 --> 07:29.480
SO I HAD ST. CATHERINE'S
SEND OVER ALL HER SCANS,

07:29.480 --> 07:30.981
AND I WANT YOU
TO TAKE THEM TO DEREK

07:30.981 --> 07:32.483
AND GET HIM TO DO A CONSULT.

07:32.483 --> 07:33.954
DEREK HATES ME.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.125
YOU ARE BETTER OFF
TAKING THEM YOURSELF.

07:35.125 --> 07:36.156
THE ONLY THING HOLDING
OUR MARRIAGE TOGETHER

07:36.156 --> 07:37.528
IS THAT WE CAN'T TALK
ABOUT NEURO,

07:37.528 --> 07:39.990
SO HE CAN'T KNOW THAT I HAD
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

07:39.990 --> 07:42.132
SO YOU'RE USING ME?
I'M YOUR TUMOR MULE?

07:42.132 --> 07:43.964
DO YOU WANT HIM
TO STOP YELLING AT YOU?

07:43.964 --> 07:45.165
HE NEEDS TO BE INSPIRED.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.502
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

07:51.502 --> 07:53.473
(Emma fusses)

07:53.473 --> 07:55.005
HEY, KAREV,
TRADE WITH ME.

07:55.005 --> 07:56.076
ORTHO FOR CARDIO.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.247
I MEAN,
YOU NEED A GOOD OUTCOME,

07:57.247 --> 07:59.109
AND I'M JUST DOING A STUPID
NECK SURGERY WITH CALLIE.

07:59.109 --> 08:01.081
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS A STUPID NECK SURGERY.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.983
YOU'RE JUST AFRAID
OF TANKING YOUR WINNING STREAK,

08:02.983 --> 08:04.214
SO NOW YOU WANT BACK ON
THE EASY TRAIN.

08:04.214 --> 08:05.516
NOT HAPPENING.

08:05.516 --> 08:07.117
WHAT EASY TRAIN?

08:07.117 --> 08:09.219
UH, THAT'S WHAT DR. KAREV
CALLS YOUR SERVICE.

08:09.219 --> 08:11.191
'CAUSE YOUR PATIENTS
NEVER DIE.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.523
IT'S A COMPLIMENT.

08:12.523 --> 08:13.994
OH, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE FACT

08:13.994 --> 08:15.566
THAT YOU'RE PILING UP
BAD OUTCOMES?

08:15.566 --> 08:17.197
THEY WERE DUD PATIENTS.

08:17.197 --> 08:20.230
OH, I'M SURE. SHALL WE?

08:20.230 --> 08:23.103
WHO DO I HAVE TO PAY TO GET
THE TENNIS MATCH ON IN HERE?

08:23.103 --> 08:25.135
UH, WE'LL HAVE A NURSE
LOOK INTO IT.

08:25.135 --> 08:27.007
YEAH, WELL, MAKE SURE
SHE'S CUTE.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.508
(chuckles)
CHUCK CAIN, 71.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.210
CAME INTO THE E.R.
LAST NIGHT

08:30.210 --> 08:33.083
AFTER A SYNCOPAL EPISODE.

08:33.083 --> 08:35.085
THE SCAN SHOWED
A NARROWED AORTIC VALVE

08:35.085 --> 08:38.048
THAT WE WILL REPLACE
DURING OPEN-HEART PROCEDURE.

08:38.048 --> 08:39.249
OPEN HEART?

08:39.249 --> 08:41.121
IT'S A SAFE SURGERY.
DON'T WORRY.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.153
I DON'T CARE ABOUT SAFE.
I CARE ABOUT THE SCAR.

08:43.153 --> 08:44.154
HOW BIG?

08:44.154 --> 08:45.596
10 INCHES AT MOST.

08:45.596 --> 08:47.057
10? NOPE.

08:47.057 --> 08:49.099
NOT DOING IT.

08:49.099 --> 08:50.530
(sighs)

08:50.530 --> 08:52.132
TRUST ME.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.034
A-A SCAR
IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY

08:54.034 --> 08:56.166
FOR HOW MUCH BETTER
YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL.

08:56.166 --> 08:57.167
HOW OLD
DO YOU THINK I AM?

08:57.167 --> 08:58.238
YOU'RE 71.

08:59.309 --> 09:01.141
BECAUSE YOU READ THE CHART.

09:01.141 --> 09:04.074
BUT IF YOU DIDN'T,
YOU'D SAY 60, RIGHT?

09:04.074 --> 09:05.075
(mutters)

09:05.075 --> 09:06.546
LOOK,
I'M IN INCREDIBLE SHAPE,

09:06.546 --> 09:08.048
AND THE LADIES AGREE.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.149
(chuckles)

09:09.149 --> 09:10.320
BUT LOOK, THE MINUTE
YOU OPEN UP MY CHEST,

09:10.320 --> 09:11.582
I'M DONE.

09:11.582 --> 09:13.253
THERE'S NO MORE MEETING WOMEN
AT THE POOL

09:13.253 --> 09:14.585
WITH A SCAR LIKE THAT.

09:14.585 --> 09:16.086
I MEAN, ALL THEY'LL SEE

09:16.086 --> 09:17.588
IS A FUTURE
OF DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS,

09:17.588 --> 09:20.130
HOSPITAL VISITS,
AND--AND BAD SEX.

09:20.130 --> 09:22.092
SO, NO.
NO OPEN-HEART SURGERY.

09:22.092 --> 09:23.163
LOOK, MR. CAIN.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.334
WE'LL INVESTIGATE
ALTERNATIVES.

09:24.334 --> 09:26.196
AND GET ME A DECENT PILLOW
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT.

09:26.196 --> 09:28.298
MY ASS HAS GOT MORE CUSHION
THAN THIS THING.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.246
(mouths words)

09:36.246 --> 09:38.208
IS IT JULY YET?

09:38.208 --> 09:41.151
'CAUSE I NEED A WHOLE NEW
CROP OF RESIDENTS.

09:41.151 --> 09:43.113
HUH. LITTLE GREY
STILL STRUGGLING?

09:43.113 --> 09:44.254
OH, SHE'S DROWNING.

09:44.254 --> 09:45.355
I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW LUCKY I HAD IT

09:45.355 --> 09:47.087
UNTIL MEREDITH
WAS OFF MY SERVICE.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.089
(chuckles)

09:49.089 --> 09:51.191
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO READ
THESE BUDGET REPORTS?

09:51.191 --> 09:52.362
NO. WHY DO YOU THINK
I GAVE UP THAT JOB?

09:52.362 --> 09:53.624
YOU'RE A HUGE HELP.

09:53.624 --> 09:56.226
HOMEMADE MAPLE-GINGER SCONES.

09:56.226 --> 09:57.227
TRY.

09:57.227 --> 09:58.268
OH, NO, NO, NO, REALLY.

09:58.268 --> 09:59.299
I JUST HAD A BIG LUNCH.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.231
THE SCONE'S A VERY TOUGH
PASTRY TO MAKE.

10:01.231 --> 10:03.103
YOU HAVE TO BE EXACT
WITH THE INGREDIENTS,

10:03.103 --> 10:04.104
THE BAKING TEMPERATURE--

10:04.104 --> 10:05.175
HEY, HOW IS THE HOUSE COMING?

10:05.175 --> 10:06.206
OH, WE'RE WORKING ON
THE DRYWALL NOW.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.207
REALLY?

10:07.207 --> 10:08.378
MM-HMM.

10:08.378 --> 10:11.341
ALL RIGHT. I GET IT.
I'M A BORE.

10:11.341 --> 10:12.683
BUT AVERY'S DOING
ALL MY SURGERIES,

10:12.683 --> 10:14.685
AND I'M TAKING UP COOKING
TO KEEP MY MIND SHARP

10:14.685 --> 10:17.217
FOR WHEN THE NEXT BIG CASE
ROLLS IN.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.388
YEAH, YOU KEEP
TELLING YOURSELF THAT.

10:18.388 --> 10:20.150
DR. SHEPHERD.

10:20.150 --> 10:21.291
YES.

10:21.291 --> 10:22.352
DR. GREY IS LOOKING FOR YOU.
SHE SAYS IT'S IMPORTANT.

10:22.352 --> 10:23.353
MY WIFE?

10:23.353 --> 10:24.354
NOPE.

10:24.354 --> 10:26.396
(sighs and groans)

10:26.396 --> 10:27.698
LEXIE.

10:27.698 --> 10:29.159
(siren wailing)

10:29.159 --> 10:30.160
TRY A SCONE.

10:30.160 --> 10:31.201
(pen thumps)

10:31.201 --> 10:32.362
YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO.

10:32.362 --> 10:34.134
UH...

10:34.134 --> 10:35.135
(chuckles)

10:35.135 --> 10:37.207
ATTABOY.
MMM.

10:37.207 --> 10:40.140
(Callie) TODAY WE'RE TAKING OUT
THE OLD HARDWARE.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.142
TOMORROW SLOAN WILL REMOVE
THE SCAR TISSUE.

10:42.142 --> 10:45.716
AND THEN WE'LL IMPLANT
THE CAGE.

10:45.716 --> 10:47.678
YEAH! ALL RIGHT.

10:47.678 --> 10:49.379
SO... YOU'RE TURN.

10:49.379 --> 10:50.380
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

10:50.380 --> 10:51.421
(laughs)

10:51.421 --> 10:53.653
JUST GET IN THERE
AND, UH,

10:53.653 --> 10:55.185
YOU KNOW, HAVE FUN WITH IT.

10:55.185 --> 10:56.687
WHY WOULDN'T YOU JUST DO
A FUSION IN THIS CASE?

10:56.687 --> 10:58.258
ISN'T THAT STANDARD PROCEDURE?

10:58.258 --> 10:59.429
HE'S HAD FOUR FUSIONS ALREADY,

10:59.429 --> 11:00.691
SO WE'RE REALLY GOING FOR
A LONG-TERM SOLUTION.

11:00.691 --> 11:02.192
REALLY GET IN THERE
WITH THE DRILL.

11:02.192 --> 11:03.393
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
COME ON.

11:03.393 --> 11:05.165
(whirring)

11:05.165 --> 11:07.437
BUT THE RISK OF PARALYSIS IS
QUITE HIGH WITH YOUR APPROACH.

11:07.437 --> 11:09.439
OUR APPROACH, AND ONLY
LAME SURGEONS DO FUSIONS.

11:09.439 --> 11:11.301
WE'RE NOT LAME.

11:11.301 --> 11:12.703
WE'REFUN...AND BADASS.

11:12.703 --> 11:14.204
HERE, LIKE THIS.

11:14.204 --> 11:16.206
(grunts)
THERE YOU GO.

11:16.206 --> 11:18.208
OH, OH, OH.

11:18.208 --> 11:19.710
(laughs) YEAH.

11:19.710 --> 11:21.281
THERE YOU GO.
FELT GOOD, RIGHT?

11:21.281 --> 11:22.352
YEP.
YEAH.

11:22.352 --> 11:24.184
(cell phone chimes)

11:24.184 --> 11:25.185
(text message alert dings)

11:25.185 --> 11:27.257
DR. YANG, THAT'S YOUR PHONE.

11:27.257 --> 11:29.189
REALLY?

11:29.189 --> 11:30.220
DURING SURGERY?

11:30.220 --> 11:31.261
OH, IT COULD BE ANYONE.

11:31.261 --> 11:32.262
MM-HMM.

11:32.262 --> 11:33.263
(chimes)

11:33.263 --> 11:34.464
(ding)

11:34.464 --> 11:36.196
MELANIE, COULD YOU PLEASE READ
DR. YANG'S MESSAGE ALOUD?

11:36.196 --> 11:37.227
MELANIE, DON'T DO THAT.

11:37.227 --> 11:38.328
YES, MELANIE, DO.
IT COULD BE CHIEF HUNT.

11:38.328 --> 11:40.400
HE MIGHT NEED DR. YANG
ON AN URGENT MATTER.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.401
(chimes)

11:41.401 --> 11:42.402
(ding)

11:42.402 --> 11:43.403
YEP.
DEFINITELY SOUNDS URGENT.

11:43.403 --> 11:44.474
(chimes and dings)

11:44.474 --> 11:45.776
MELANIE, DON'T TOUCH
THAT PHONE!

11:45.776 --> 11:47.707
JUST, UM...

11:47.707 --> 11:49.279
TURN IT OFF.

11:49.279 --> 11:50.340
(monitor beeps rhythmically)

11:56.416 --> 11:58.448
NO MORE TEXTING ME
IN THE O.R.

11:58.448 --> 12:01.291
WELL, DID ANYONE...

12:01.291 --> 12:02.422
NO.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.224
GOOD.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.356
'CAUSE THE ONLY THING GETTING ME
THROUGH THESE BUDGET REPORTS

12:06.356 --> 12:07.497
IS THAT,

12:07.497 --> 12:09.299
AND I GET TO DO THIS.

12:09.299 --> 12:11.401
MMM.

12:11.401 --> 12:13.433
(both moaning)

12:13.433 --> 12:14.504
I HAVE TO CHECK
ON MY PATIENT.

12:14.504 --> 12:15.806
MNH-MNH.

12:15.806 --> 12:17.307
I DON'T WANT CALLIE
TO GIVE ME A BAD OUTCOME.

12:17.307 --> 12:19.369
I'LL BE QUICK.
COME ON.

12:19.369 --> 12:20.440
AH. (laughs)

12:20.440 --> 12:21.772
BACK, BACK, BACK, BACK,
BACK, BACK.

12:21.772 --> 12:23.743
OKAY, BUT, OH, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

12:23.743 --> 12:27.347
HUNT,
I FOUND LAST YEAR'S BUDGET.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.319
I WAS JUST WON--WHOA.
OH, WHOA.

12:29.319 --> 12:30.420
UM, UH, UH, EXCUSE ME.

12:30.420 --> 12:32.422
NO, IT'S OKAY.
I WAS JUST LEAVING.

12:32.422 --> 12:33.784
MM.

12:33.784 --> 12:36.256
AHEM.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.258
KEEP YOUR PHONE ON.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.330
OKAY.

12:40.330 --> 12:42.432
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM?

12:42.432 --> 12:43.433
RICHARD--

12:43.433 --> 12:45.465
HUNT,
YOU'RE A CHIEF NOW.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.267
ACT LIKE IT.

12:49.800 --> 12:53.303
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM?

12:55.345 --> 12:56.346
(door closes)

12:56.346 --> 12:58.378
SO TELL ME
YOU FOUND THE ARTICLE

12:58.378 --> 12:59.449
I ASKED YOU FOR
TWO DAYS AGO.

12:59.449 --> 13:01.381
NO, BUT I'M REALLY CLOSE.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.383
THIS IS THE CHART OF A PATIENT
WITH A BUTTERFLY TUMOR.

13:03.383 --> 13:04.454
BUTTERFLY TUMORS
ARE INOPERABLE.

13:04.454 --> 13:06.286
NO, I-I KNOW,
BUT THIS PATIENT,

13:06.286 --> 13:08.418
SHE'S A NEW MOM, AND IT'S
A REALLY SAD STORY, ACTUALLY,

13:08.418 --> 13:10.560
BUT I WAS WONDERING IF YOU
COULD DO A QUICK CONSULT--

13:10.560 --> 13:12.562
THIS IS WHY YOU NEEDED
TO FIND ME SO URGENTLY...
(elevator bell dings)

13:12.562 --> 13:14.494
TO TELL A WOMAN
HER TUMOR'S INOPERABLE,

13:14.494 --> 13:16.526
TO REMIND HER HOW SAD
HER STORY IS?

13:16.526 --> 13:17.527
NO, I-I-I JUST--

13:17.527 --> 13:19.399
JUST FIND THE ARTICLE.

13:19.399 --> 13:20.530
(sighs)

13:20.530 --> 13:22.432
HEY, UM, APRIL, I CAN'T COVER
THE E.R. TONIGHT.

13:22.432 --> 13:23.834
I HAVE TO DO RESEARCH
FOR SHEPHERD.

13:23.834 --> 13:24.875
NO, WHAT? I--

13:24.875 --> 13:26.436
I--TAKE IT UP WITH SHEPHERD.

13:26.436 --> 13:27.807
I--COME O--

13:27.807 --> 13:29.339
(sighs)

13:29.339 --> 13:30.440
WHERE ARE MY MOUSE LABS?

13:30.440 --> 13:32.382
OH, UH, S-SORRY. I WAS STUCK
IN THE O.R. ALL DAY,

13:32.382 --> 13:34.314
TRYING NOT TO FALL BEHIND
IN MY SURGERIES.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.847
OH, SO YOU'D RATHER JUST FALL
BEHIND IN MY OPINION OF YOU?

13:36.847 --> 13:38.849
I WILL TAKE CARE OF IT
RIGHT AWAY.

13:38.849 --> 13:41.551
IT'S HARD TO BE A TEAM WHEN ONLY
ONE PLAYER CARES, KEPNER.

13:41.551 --> 13:43.553
NOW WE REMOVED
ALL THE OLD HARDWARE,

13:43.553 --> 13:46.326
AND WE'RE ALL SET TO IMPLANT
THE CAGE TOMORROW.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.397
SO JUST TRY TO GET
SOME REST, OKAY?

13:47.397 --> 13:49.329
(Mrs. Moser) OH, WELL,
I'M GONNA STAY THE NIGHT

13:49.329 --> 13:50.830
AND MAKE SURE, UH,
HE'S GOT SOME COMPANY.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.903
I'LL STAY.
I-I-I DON'T NEED THE REST.

13:52.903 --> 13:54.404
A-AND I DO?

13:54.404 --> 13:55.535
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT

13:55.535 --> 13:58.408
HOW--HOW BIG THE--THE BAGS
UNDER YOUR EYES ARE, SO--

13:58.408 --> 13:59.870
WHAT?
AREN'T VISITING HOURS OVER?

14:01.341 --> 14:02.342
YES.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.843
THEY ARE.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.445
SORRY.

14:05.445 --> 14:06.616
UH...

14:06.616 --> 14:08.378
UM, UH, ALL RIGHT.
WELL, CALL IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

14:08.378 --> 14:09.519
ALL RIGHT?
OKAY.

14:09.519 --> 14:11.481
(sighs) OKAY.

14:11.481 --> 14:13.353
WHEW.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.424
WELL...

14:14.424 --> 14:16.556
SURGERY BRINGS OUT
THE WORST IN PEOPLE.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.628
MARRIAGE BRINGS OUT
THE WORST IN THEM.

14:18.628 --> 14:19.930
I'M GRATEFUL
THEY DROPPED EVERYTHING

14:19.930 --> 14:21.531
TO HELP TAKE CARE OF ME,

14:21.531 --> 14:23.894
BUT SERIOUSLY, THE SECOND
I'M BETTER, I'M MOVING OUT.

14:23.894 --> 14:25.865
I NEED SOME PEACE AND QUIET.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.537
WELL...

14:27.537 --> 14:29.539
LET ME HELP YOU
GET SOME NOW, OKAY?

14:29.539 --> 14:30.901
(chuckles)

14:37.377 --> 14:38.408
MM!

14:40.911 --> 14:42.382
WH-WHAT THE HELL?

14:42.382 --> 14:43.553
I WANT TO CHECK YOUR REFLEXES
EVERY HALF-HOUR

14:43.553 --> 14:45.515
TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO
NERVE DAMAGE FROM THE SURGERY.

14:45.515 --> 14:46.656
(sighs)

14:46.656 --> 14:48.618
(toothbrush scrubs)

14:51.661 --> 14:53.393
(sighs)
YOU'RE HOME ALREADY?

14:53.393 --> 14:55.465
YEAH, IT'S THE ADVANTAGE
OF A BORING CASELOAD.

14:55.465 --> 14:56.666
WELL, DID YOUR DAY
GET ANY BETTER?

14:56.666 --> 14:59.499
YES, IF YOU COUNT
THE FRIED CHICKEN SANDWICH

14:59.499 --> 15:02.402
I GOT IN THE CAFETERIA.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.974
MMM.

15:03.974 --> 15:05.435
(kissing)

15:05.435 --> 15:06.536
ANY INTERESTING CASES
TOMORROW?

15:06.536 --> 15:07.677
MEREDITH.

15:07.677 --> 15:08.678
NO WORK TALK.

15:08.678 --> 15:10.580
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

15:11.942 --> 15:13.513
MEREDITH.

15:13.513 --> 15:14.914
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL DEREK
ABOUT MARY'S TUMOR?

15:14.914 --> 15:16.987
I-I-I DID.
HE SAID IT WAS INOPERABLE.

15:16.987 --> 15:18.488
DID YOU SHOW HIM THE SCANS?

15:18.488 --> 15:19.519
DID YOU TELL HIM IT WAS IN
THE FRONTAL LOBE?

15:19.519 --> 15:20.590
UH, I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE.

15:20.590 --> 15:23.623
UM, I AM NAKED AND WET
IN THE SHOWER, SO--

15:23.623 --> 15:25.625
DEREK'S A TUMOR JUNKIE.
HE NEEDS TO SEE THE SCANS

15:25.625 --> 15:28.498
AND MEET THE PATIENT
TO SPARK THE CASE,

15:28.498 --> 15:30.700
THE SAME WAY HE NEEDS
A 16th TOWEL IN THE O.R.

15:30.700 --> 15:32.532
TO POSITION HIS ARM
ON THE MICROSCOPE.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.934
ARE YOU GONNA REMEMBER ALL THIS
OR DO I NEED TO WRITE IT DOWN?

15:34.934 --> 15:37.567
NAKED AND WET
IN THE SHOWER.

15:37.567 --> 15:38.568
I NEED TO WRITE IT DOWN.

15:39.970 --> 15:40.971
(indistinct conversations)

15:40.971 --> 15:42.612
CHUCK CAIN.

15:42.612 --> 15:45.445
I GAVE YOU HIS BLOOD WORK
FIVE HOURS AGO.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.447
ALEX, I NEED YOU TO COVER
THE E.R. TONIGHT.

15:47.447 --> 15:48.618
NO.

15:48.618 --> 15:50.580
LOOK, BEFORE MIDNIGHT
WOULD BE NICE.

15:50.580 --> 15:52.652
(man) I'M STILL LOOKING.
IT'S THE E.R. PEOPLE WILL DIE
IF WE'RE NOT THERE.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.954
WHICH WILL BE YOUR FAULT,
NOT MINE.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.456
GOT IT. HERE YOU GO.
(sighs)

15:56.456 --> 15:57.657
FINALLY.

15:57.657 --> 16:00.530
ALEX, PLEASE, CAN'T YOU JUST
BE A PERSON FOR A SECOND?

16:00.530 --> 16:02.032
SEE?

16:02.032 --> 16:04.494
THIS IS WHY YOU DON'T
DESERVE THIS JOB.

16:04.494 --> 16:05.595
YOU'RE BAD AT IT.

16:05.595 --> 16:07.667
YOU GET ALL STRESSED OUT
AND FRANTIC

16:07.667 --> 16:09.039
AND NOBODY WANTS TO LISTEN
TO YOU.

16:09.039 --> 16:11.501
YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY,
AND YOUR VOICE...

16:11.501 --> 16:12.602
(high-pitched, nasal voice)
IT GETS ALL HIGH AND NASALLY

16:12.602 --> 16:13.643
LIKE THIS WHEN YOU'RE NERVOUS.

16:13.643 --> 16:14.704
IT'S ANNOYING.

16:14.704 --> 16:16.006
(normal voice)
YOU'RE ANNOYING, SO, NO,

16:16.006 --> 16:17.477
I CAN'T BE A PERSON
FOR A SECOND.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.508
DEAL WITH YOUR OWN CRAP!

16:28.988 --> 16:31.991
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

16:33.523 --> 16:35.495
STILL NOT PARALYZED.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.626
GOOD.

16:36.626 --> 16:39.029
DO YOU KNOW YOU SNORE?

16:39.029 --> 16:41.031
YES, AND I'VE BEEN TOLD
IT'S ADORABLE.

16:41.031 --> 16:42.032
IT'S NOT.

16:42.032 --> 16:43.033
(Mr. Moser) MORNING.

16:43.033 --> 16:44.574
OH, SORRY WE'RE LATE,
BABY.

16:44.574 --> 16:46.506
OH, OF COURSE, YOUR,
UH, SMARTY-PANTS FATHER

16:46.506 --> 16:48.638
REFUSED TO CHECK
THE TRAFFIC REPORT.

16:48.638 --> 16:49.639
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

16:49.639 --> 16:51.010
UH, HE CAN'T EAT
BEFORE SURGERY.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.782
SEE? I TOLD YOU,
NO FOOD ALLOWED.

16:52.782 --> 16:54.013
OH, PLEASE.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.045
ONE LITTLE DOUGHNUT
WON'T HURT.

16:55.045 --> 16:56.516
ACTUALLY, IT WILL,

16:56.516 --> 16:57.587
JUST LIKE IT WILL IT HURT
ALL OF YOU

16:57.587 --> 16:58.648
BY PROMOTING, UH,
HIGH CHOLESTEROL

16:58.648 --> 17:00.750
AND PLAQUE BUILDUP.

17:00.750 --> 17:02.622
(Mrs. Moser chuckles)

17:02.622 --> 17:04.054
(indistinct conversations)

17:04.054 --> 17:06.056
(elevator bell dings)

17:06.056 --> 17:07.097
AH.

17:07.097 --> 17:08.698
I CONFIRMED YOUR CONSULTS,

17:08.698 --> 17:10.600
AND I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA ASK ME
ABOUT THAT--THAT ARTICLE, BUT--

17:10.600 --> 17:12.532
OH, YOU--YOU HAVEN'T
FOUND IT YET?
LOOK!

17:12.532 --> 17:14.604
BUTTERFLY TUMOR.

17:14.604 --> 17:15.665
(sighs)

17:18.768 --> 17:20.610
(elevator bell dings)
HUH.

17:20.610 --> 17:21.741
WAIT. I MEAN,
ALL THE DOCTORS WE'VE SEEN

17:21.741 --> 17:23.613
SAID THE TUMOR'S INOPERABLE.

17:23.613 --> 17:25.675
SURGERY COULD PUT HER
IN A COMA OR KILL HER.

17:25.675 --> 17:26.746
IT'S JUST ANOTHER SET
OF SCANS.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.078
EXACTLY,
AND IT'LL BE GOOD FOR YOU

17:28.078 --> 17:29.679
TO HAVE
SOME ALONE TIME WITH EMMA.

17:29.679 --> 17:31.821
YOU KNOW, THAT WAY I CAN DIE
KNOWING THAT

17:31.821 --> 17:33.823
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
DROP HER ON HER HEAD.

17:33.823 --> 17:35.655
(Emma fussing)

17:35.655 --> 17:37.627
FINE.

17:37.627 --> 17:38.828
RUN THE SCANS.

17:42.592 --> 17:44.134
OKAY.

17:44.134 --> 17:45.765
I REALLY DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.567
TWO MORE MOMS JUST CAME IN.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.099
WELL, YEAH, BUT A-AS LONG
AS NO ONE'S CROWNING,

17:49.099 --> 17:50.570
THEY'LL BE FINE.

17:50.570 --> 17:51.841
(squeaks)

17:51.841 --> 17:53.103
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

17:53.103 --> 17:54.774
UH, RESEARCHING A NEW SURGERY
FOR MY NECK GUY.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.606
WHAT ARE YOU FEEDING
MY MOUSE?

17:56.606 --> 17:59.109
Q. IS DIABETIC.
A DOUGHNUT COULD KILL HIM.

17:59.109 --> 18:00.680
THEN WHY IS HE
IN YOUR OFFICE?

18:00.680 --> 18:02.112
SO MEREDITH
CAN RUN TESTS ON HIM.

18:02.112 --> 18:04.754
ARE YOU REALLY GONNA DO
HER GRUNT WORK?

18:04.754 --> 18:07.157
OH, BAILEY BLAMES ME
FOR RICHARD LOSING HIS TRIAL.

18:07.157 --> 18:10.720
THE LAST THING SHE WANTS
IS FOR ME TO WORK ON IT.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.622
WHICH IS WHY YOU'RE DOING IT
IN SECRET.

18:12.622 --> 18:14.794
OKAY, THAT IS THE WORST IDEA
I'VE EVER HEARD.

18:14.794 --> 18:15.795
SERIOUSLY.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.767
I AM YOUR CHIEF RESIDENT,
DR. GREY.

18:17.767 --> 18:20.770
(Meredith and Cristina laughing)

18:22.832 --> 18:24.774
(deepened voice)
WHICH MEANS IF YOU CROSS ME,

18:24.774 --> 18:27.837
I WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE
A LIVING HELL.

18:27.837 --> 18:30.840
I WILL PUT YOU ON CALL
EVERY NIGHT,

18:30.840 --> 18:33.713
I WILL ASSIGN YOU
DUMB INTERNS,

18:33.713 --> 18:35.145
AND I WILL MAKE SURE

18:35.145 --> 18:39.689
THAT YOU GET EVERY EXPLODING
BOWEL AND ROTTING LIMB

18:39.689 --> 18:41.821
THAT COMES
INTO THIS HOSPITAL.

18:43.193 --> 18:44.624
OKAY.

18:44.624 --> 18:45.825
RELAX. I'LL DO IT.

18:47.697 --> 18:50.800
O-OKAY.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.704
IT'S 'CAUSE I MADE
MY VOICE DIFFERENT, RIGHT?

18:54.704 --> 18:56.166
THAT'S--
THAT'S WHY YOU LIS--

18:56.166 --> 18:57.767
GO AWAY BEFORE YOU
EMBARRASS YOURSELF MORE.

18:59.809 --> 19:00.910
(cell phone chimes)

19:00.910 --> 19:02.912
(text message alert dings)

19:02.912 --> 19:05.175
OH, THAT'S OWEN.
DUTY CALLS.

19:05.175 --> 19:08.648
ARE YOU TWO TALKING YET,
OR IS IT JUST SEX?

19:08.648 --> 19:09.719
NOT JUST SEX.

19:09.719 --> 19:11.781
HOT, DIRTY,
STAND-ON-MY-HEAD SEX.

19:11.781 --> 19:13.653
I'LL TAKE THAT AS A NO.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.725
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHO CARES IF WE TALK?

19:15.725 --> 19:17.227
BESIDES, IF YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING,

19:17.227 --> 19:20.690
HOW ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
WASTING YOUR FIFTH YEAR

19:20.690 --> 19:22.662
PLAYING AROUND
WITH VAGINAS AND MICE, HUH?

19:22.662 --> 19:23.733
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT?

19:23.733 --> 19:25.865
DO YOU REALLY
STAND ON YOUR HEAD?

19:25.865 --> 19:27.937
I'M VERY TALENTED.

19:27.937 --> 19:29.869
OH.

19:29.869 --> 19:32.242
THIS PROCEDURE
IS MINIMALLY INVASIVE.

19:32.242 --> 19:34.744
AND THE GREAT NEWS IS,

19:34.744 --> 19:36.746
THE SCAR WILL LOOK LIKE THIS.

19:36.746 --> 19:37.847
IT'S MUCH SMALLER.

19:37.847 --> 19:39.679
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
BUT I WANT THIS INSTEAD.

19:39.679 --> 19:40.750
(tablet beeps)

19:40.750 --> 19:42.682
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

19:42.682 --> 19:43.753
THAT'S
MY FRIEND TONY'S GROIN.

19:43.753 --> 19:44.884
I HAD HIM E-MAIL ME
A PICTURE LAST NIGHT.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.916
HE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM
WITH HIS VALVE LAST YEAR,

19:46.916 --> 19:50.189
AND HIS DOCTOR REPLACED IT WITH
A CATHETER THROUGH THE GROIN.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.221
SEE? BARELY ANY SCAR.

19:51.221 --> 19:53.823
IT'S CALLED A T-A-V-I.

19:53.823 --> 19:55.725
YEAH, A TAVI IS
AN EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE.

19:55.725 --> 19:56.926
THERE ARE--
THERE ARE TONS OF RISKS--

19:56.926 --> 19:59.229
UH, BLEEDING, STROKE--

19:59.229 --> 20:00.970
LOOK, I'M THE ONE HAVING THIS
AND PAYING FOR IT, RIGHT?

20:00.970 --> 20:02.902
SO IF I SAY I WANT A TAVI,
GIVE ME A TAVI.

20:02.902 --> 20:06.776
LOOK, THERE IS A MUCH SAFER
SOLUTION TO YOUR PROBLEM.

20:06.776 --> 20:08.778
IT'S CALLED A-A RASH GUARD.
YOU WEAR IT AT THE POOL.

20:08.778 --> 20:09.879
NO ONE WILL SEE YOUR SCAR.

20:09.879 --> 20:11.711
CLEARLY YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
TO PALM BEACH.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.713
ONLY FATTIES WEAR RASH GUARDS.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.785
(lowered voice) I CAN'T
GET THROUGH TO THIS GUY.

20:15.785 --> 20:16.916
(lowered voice)
HE WANTS A TAVI.

20:16.916 --> 20:19.789
LOOK INTO IT AND DECIDE
IF HE'S A GOOD CANDIDATE.

20:22.252 --> 20:24.223
I'LL LOOK INTO A TAVI.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.955
SEE? NOW THAT'S THE ANSWER
I WAS LOOKING FOR.

20:25.955 --> 20:27.257
I KNEW YOU HAD IT IN YOU,
KID.

20:28.828 --> 20:31.301
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

20:31.301 --> 20:33.903
(jangles keys)

20:33.903 --> 20:35.735
UH, HEY, GREY.

20:35.735 --> 20:36.936
UH, NO, KEEP WALKING.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.269
EYES AHEAD. ACT NORMAL.

20:39.269 --> 20:41.741
I SAW KEPNER TAKE A MOUSE
INTO THAT ROOM.

20:41.741 --> 20:42.872
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:42.872 --> 20:44.243
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.945
YOU BLINKED.
(whispers) OKAY.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.947
(lowered voice) OKAY,
NOW YOU KNOW SOMETHING.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.248
IS SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THE DEVICE?

20:49.248 --> 20:50.249
(lowered voice) I REALLY
SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT IT.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.751
GREY.

20:51.751 --> 20:52.982
BAILEY'S NOT GONNA
FIND OUT ABOUT IT?

20:52.982 --> 20:54.824
BAILEY LOCKED ME OUT OF
MY OWN MOUSE LAB.

20:54.824 --> 20:55.955
I'M NOT TELLING HER CRAP.

20:57.827 --> 20:59.028
SOME OF THE MICE
ARE HYPERGLYCEMIC.

20:59.028 --> 21:00.960
WE'RE RUNNING SOME TESTS
TO FIND OUT WHY.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.962
ALL RIGHT,
THIS IS WHAT YOU DO--

21:02.962 --> 21:04.263
GET A HEALTHY MOUSE,
RUN SOME LABS,

21:04.263 --> 21:05.995
AND COMPARE THE STATS.
CAN YOU DO THAT?

21:05.995 --> 21:07.036
WELL, APRIL'S BEING
A LITTLE BIT--

21:07.036 --> 21:08.898
OH, YOU CAN HANDLE KEPNER,
GREY.

21:08.898 --> 21:10.940
NOW I'M ON CALL, SO PAGE ME
WHEN YOU GET THE RESULTS.

21:10.940 --> 21:11.941
OKAY.

21:11.941 --> 21:13.803
ALL RIGHT.

21:13.803 --> 21:15.274
WH--UH...

21:15.274 --> 21:18.908
HI THERE. UH, UM,
BEAUTIFUL DAY, ISN'T IT?

21:21.010 --> 21:22.281
OH, DAMN IT.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.783
YOU NEED A HAND?

21:23.783 --> 21:25.985
UH, NO, JU-JUST,
THE CAGE WON'T FIT.

21:25.985 --> 21:28.858
HIS BONE'S SO DESTROYED,
THE SCREWS WON'T HOLD.

21:28.858 --> 21:29.989
(sighs deeply)
WE SHOULD DO
THE FUSION INSTEAD.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.891
NO.
WELL, I RESEARCHED IT.

21:31.891 --> 21:34.293
(sighs)
WE CAN RE-FUSE HIM IF WE TAKE
DOWN ENOUGH OF HIS SCAR TISSUE--

30:26.525 --> 30:27.897
AND ALTERNATING
CROSS CONNECTORS.

30:27.897 --> 30:28.958
I'M GONNA LINK
THE THREE RODS TOGETHER.

30:28.958 --> 30:30.930
WHAT? YOU CAN USE
THE COBALT RODS FOR THIS?

30:30.930 --> 30:32.061
WHAT DO YOU CARE?
YOU'RE OFF THE CASE.

30:32.061 --> 30:34.003
(metal clinks)

30:34.003 --> 30:36.035
GO!

30:36.035 --> 30:37.506
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET THE NEXT ONE.

30:37.506 --> 30:38.507
(clicks)

30:38.507 --> 30:39.969
(grunts)

30:39.969 --> 30:42.912
I COMPARED HEALTHY
AND HYPERGLYCEMIC MICE.

30:42.912 --> 30:44.513
IT LOOKS LIKE THE ISLET CELLS
ARE BEING REJECTED.

30:44.513 --> 30:46.515
SO IT'S NOT THE DEVICE.
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

30:46.515 --> 30:47.877
(clicks)

30:47.877 --> 30:49.048
UH, IT COULD BE

30:49.048 --> 30:51.020
A RECURRENCE
OF AUTOIMMUNITY...

30:51.020 --> 30:52.621
OR A PROBLEM
WITH THE ENGRAFTMENT.

30:52.621 --> 30:54.954
MAYBE IT'S NOT THE CELLS
BEING REJECTED.

30:54.954 --> 30:57.056
MAYBE THEY'RE JUST NOT SURVIVING
BECAUSE OF OTHER CAUSES.

30:57.056 --> 30:58.857
SO WE SHOULD CHECK FOR SIGNS
OF REJECTION?

30:58.857 --> 31:01.530
EXACTLY. OKAY.
BUMP ME.

31:01.530 --> 31:02.962
(elevator bell dings)

31:02.962 --> 31:04.533
WE'RE LOOKING
IN THE WRONG PLACE.

31:04.533 --> 31:05.895
THE DEVICE IS WORKING,

31:05.895 --> 31:07.596
BUT SOMETHING IS HARMING
THE ISLET CELLS.

31:07.596 --> 31:08.867
HOW DID YOU FIGURE THAT OUT?

31:08.867 --> 31:09.999
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

31:09.999 --> 31:12.942
SO TELL BAILEY TO LOOK
FOR SIGNS OF REJECTION.

31:12.942 --> 31:15.574
AND WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU ARE?

31:15.574 --> 31:17.046
WHAT, GOD,
IS THAT WHO YOU ARE?

31:17.046 --> 31:19.078
DR. BAILEY, SHE WAS JUST
DOING WHAT I ASKED HER TO DO.

31:19.078 --> 31:20.609
BECAUSE EITHER YOU'RE GOD,

31:20.609 --> 31:23.582
OR YOU ARETHEMOST RECKLESS,
ARROGANT RESIDENT

31:23.582 --> 31:25.955

IN MY ENTIRE CAREER.

31:25.955 --> 31:28.657
I MEAN, TO PUT YOUR HANDS
ON ANOTHER CLINICAL TRIAL

31:28.657 --> 31:30.920
AFTER YOU ALREADY RUINED ONE
IS A LEVEL OF STUPIDITY

31:30.920 --> 31:32.621
SO STAGGERING--

31:32.621 --> 31:35.024
I DELEGATED.
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO--

31:35.024 --> 31:36.966
YOU ARE FIRED
FROM MY TRIAL, KEPNER.

31:36.966 --> 31:38.097
AND YOU...

31:38.097 --> 31:39.999
(clenched teeth)
JUST GIVE ME BACK MY MOUSE.

31:39.999 --> 31:41.000
I--

31:41.000 --> 31:44.603
NOT UNTIL YOU READ
MY RESEARCH.

31:44.603 --> 31:45.604
DR. BAILEY!

31:45.604 --> 31:47.136
(deepens voice)
READ MY RESEARCH.

31:47.136 --> 31:49.078
(grunts)

31:51.981 --> 31:53.612
MM.

31:55.945 --> 31:57.146
HEY, THAT KINDA WORKS.

31:58.647 --> 32:00.089
(Derek) OKAY, I'VE CLEARED OUT
THE TUMOR

32:00.089 --> 32:02.121
ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BRAIN,
BUT LOOK.

32:02.121 --> 32:04.693
SEE ALL THOSE VESSELS
BLOCKING THE WAY NOW?

32:04.693 --> 32:06.125

OF DEFENSE.

32:06.125 --> 32:08.157

SO SMART.

32:08.157 --> 32:10.059
IT GROWS
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BRAIN

32:10.059 --> 32:12.601
SO WE'LL BE TOO SCARED
TO CROSS OVER.

32:12.601 --> 32:15.164

THAT'S--THAT'S SOMETHING.

32:15.164 --> 32:16.966
