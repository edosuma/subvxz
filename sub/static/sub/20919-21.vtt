<i>An alien named
the Beyonder took pieces of worlds,</i>

00:07.431 --> 00:10.233
<i>then mashed them together

00:10.369 --> 00:12.857
<i>The people
from those places, including the Avengers,</i>

00:12.924 --> 00:14.244
<i>were brought

00:14.312 --> 00:16.279
<i>The Beyonder calls this
his experiment.</i>

00:16.393 --> 00:18.533
<i>We call it twisted
and dangerous.</i>

00:18.997 --> 00:21.315
<i>After Loki joined our side,
we tried to use</i>

00:21.383 --> 00:23.948
<i>the Asgardian Bifrost
to send everyone home.</i>

00:24.065 --> 00:25.666
<i>It didn't work.</i>

00:26.459 --> 00:29.056
<i>The Beyonder retaliated by splitting
Hulk in two,</i>

00:29.151 --> 00:31.057

both away.</i>

00:33.058 --> 00:35.666

00:42.808 --> 00:44.775

02:03.215 --> 02:06.504
Hey, birdie! Now that
I have your attention...

02:08.394 --> 02:12.738
Well, well, well. Bruce Banner, I presume?
Good to see you alive.

02:12.879 --> 02:16.664
Can't believe you two are here.
But, man, am I glad you are.

02:16.751 --> 02:18.454
Welcome to Weirdworld.

02:21.301 --> 02:23.324
Excuse me a sec.

02:24.433 --> 02:26.621
Quit toying with it
and take it down!

02:28.029 --> 02:29.660
You know what this place
reminds me of?

02:29.762 --> 02:31.785
The time I took down
a Chitauri warship

02:31.853 --> 02:33.066
that landed in the jungle

02:33.134 --> 02:34.540
in South America.

02:34.855 --> 02:37.363
- They were tough.
- Whoa!

02:37.551 --> 02:40.215
But it turns out
the piranhas were tougher.

02:44.668 --> 02:46.813
That's it.
Hold it steady.

02:51.954 --> 02:54.821
Widow, wanna drop the
Hawksquatch, or should I?

02:54.908 --> 02:56.392
Allow me.

03:04.821 --> 03:06.212
Electro-spears.

03:06.439 --> 03:09.884
They have xylem tree sap here
that generates 10,000 volts.

03:10.071 --> 03:12.743
You do not want to know
how I discovered that.

03:13.196 --> 03:16.259
Bruce Banner,
the wizard of Weirdworld.

03:16.892 --> 03:19.493
I'm surprised you haven't
built a coconut radio.

03:19.605 --> 03:20.861
Right, Natasha?

03:21.316 --> 03:22.837
All righty, then.

03:23.084 --> 03:25.051
Let's get you back
to Avengers Tower.

03:25.345 --> 03:28.388
I'm not going anywhere.
I've got unfinished business.

03:28.673 --> 03:29.829
Look out!

03:34.234 --> 03:35.249
The Hulk!

03:35.370 --> 03:37.249
Knew he couldn't resist.

03:44.218 --> 03:46.072
He's still split
into two people.

03:46.159 --> 03:47.781
I was prepared for that.

03:47.968 --> 03:50.242
But I wasn't prepared
for this.

03:50.367 --> 03:53.289
What are you waiting for, Hulk?
Fight me!

04:03.435 --> 04:04.514
Gotcha!

04:14.803 --> 04:17.194
No.
That should've held him.

04:19.865 --> 04:21.608
Get back here!

04:22.812 --> 04:25.570
Bruce, forget the Hulk.
Leave him here in the jungle

04:25.680 --> 04:27.729
and come back
to the Avengers with us.

04:28.148 --> 04:31.812
I can't leave. Not until I've
taken care of him for good.

04:32.226 --> 04:35.578
But isn't this what you've
always wanted? To be free of the Hulk?

04:36.023 --> 04:37.804
I'll never
be free of the Hulk.

04:37.953 --> 04:40.179
Not as long as he's still alive.

04:43.376 --> 04:44.726
Take cover.

04:55.859 --> 04:58.945
The creatures, the landscape,
the weather?

04:59.140 --> 05:02.617
And even the sky.
I've seen weirder.

05:05.804 --> 05:08.035
Like I said, weird.

05:08.226 --> 05:12.091
I've seen a lot of stuff in my life,
but this place is all new to me.

05:12.304 --> 05:14.539
Remind you of anything
you've seen?

05:16.296 --> 05:19.203
Earth to Romanoff!
I heard you.

05:19.515 --> 05:21.742
Natasha's not really one
for small talk.

05:21.864 --> 05:24.695
Everything for her
is need-to-know basis.

05:25.078 --> 05:28.703
Hey, you never know when something from
a past mission will come in handy.

05:28.817 --> 05:31.710
And it's good to know about
your teammates' experiences.

05:34.797 --> 05:36.078
Hulk's been here.

05:36.976 --> 05:38.148
This way.

05:38.786 --> 05:41.585
See? Third destroyed
village this week.

05:41.804 --> 05:43.757
This is what
the Hulk does.

05:46.390 --> 05:50.124
Burn marks.
This wasn't the Hulk.

05:50.664 --> 05:54.350
Besides, he's always been able to
control his rage from hurting anyone.

05:54.515 --> 05:57.703
Yeah. Any good in him,
any control, was me.

05:58.054 --> 06:00.840
Now that we're two people,
he's just raw anger,

06:01.093 --> 06:04.148
and stopping him
is my responsibility.

06:06.004 --> 06:07.851
You know the Hulk
better than I do.

06:08.015 --> 06:11.249
If we have to take him down,
you have any ideas or tips?

06:11.335 --> 06:13.686
Or is that on
a need-to-know basis too?

06:13.828 --> 06:15.421
I don't know. Maybe.

06:15.775 --> 06:17.843
This isn't small talk.

06:19.039 --> 06:21.789
This is the mission.
You need to talk more.

06:22.468 --> 06:24.820
Maybe you need to talk less.

06:25.249 --> 06:27.562
Look, I'm not worried
about the Hulk.

06:27.887 --> 06:31.867
I'm more worried about Bruce.
The split's changed him.

06:41.949 --> 06:44.865
What are we waiting for?
He's out in the open.

06:45.187 --> 06:47.999
Stay here, unless you want
to wander into the trap too.

06:48.203 --> 06:49.687
What kind of trap?

07:03.117 --> 07:05.742
- Whoa.
- Carnivorous plants.

07:05.929 --> 07:08.117
I bioengineered them
to attack Hulk's scent.

07:11.202 --> 07:13.148
- Got him.
- You got him.

07:13.304 --> 07:15.101
But what do you plan
to do with him?

07:20.888 --> 07:24.056
Oh, it's not his plan.
It's mine.

07:24.664 --> 07:26.006
Friend of yours?

07:26.084 --> 07:29.781
Banner, how rude of you
not to introduce us.

07:30.558 --> 07:34.867
I am known as Morgan Le Fay,
queen of this realm.

07:35.187 --> 07:39.372
She's a sorceress. Manipulates
magic energy. Ruler of Weirdworld.

07:39.531 --> 07:42.041
She doesn't
exactly seem friendly.

07:42.484 --> 07:45.328
I'm working for her.
Morgan Le Fay and I

07:45.498 --> 07:47.382
are gonna kill the Hulk.

07:50.031 --> 07:52.679
- You're going to what?
- Kill the Hulk?

07:53.078 --> 07:56.226
I'm willing to do whatever
it takes to stop him.

07:57.242 --> 07:59.671
Oh, don't
be so overdramatic.

07:59.851 --> 08:03.890
You can't escape. Besides, you might
like what I've planned for you.

08:04.046 --> 08:06.210
Probably not, but you might.

08:16.812 --> 08:18.289
Get him!

08:39.085 --> 08:40.710
That tar pit
should've held him!

08:40.866 --> 08:45.052
- Bruce, you can't hurt the Hulk.
- It's probably not even possible.

08:45.382 --> 08:47.968
He's our teammate and friend,
just as much as you are.

08:48.069 --> 08:49.273
And there's no telling

08:49.341 --> 08:51.218
what it
could do to you if Hulk is hurt.

08:51.562 --> 08:53.640
You have no idea
what it's like to live with

08:53.708 --> 08:55.710
that kind of power
and anger every day.

08:56.039 --> 08:58.468
We need the Hulk's
power and anger.

08:58.624 --> 09:00.624
You've been on more missions
with the green guy.

09:00.733 --> 09:03.233
Help Bruce remember
what Hulk does for us.

09:03.301 --> 09:04.671
He remembers.

09:04.804 --> 09:06.429
I remember everything,

09:06.527 --> 09:08.734
and you'll never be
able to understand.

09:09.492 --> 09:11.062
He would never admit it,

09:11.332 --> 09:14.289
but Bruce is pretty good
at the angry thing too.

09:22.543 --> 09:24.249
Do you know
what I just realized?

09:24.397 --> 09:26.960
You like
the mindless green brute.

09:27.081 --> 09:29.601
Well, that does
complicate my plans.

09:29.802 --> 09:33.039
Better to take the complications
out of the picture.

09:36.698 --> 09:39.929
Gotta be faster than that if
you're gonna get the drop on us.

09:40.164 --> 09:43.828
Thank you for the tip.
I'll try and remember that!

09:59.859 --> 10:02.382
Ooh! You're a feisty one.

10:09.641 --> 10:10.987
Huh?

10:13.730 --> 10:16.229
What an adorable little threat.

10:26.262 --> 10:27.688
When I get loose,

10:27.824 --> 10:30.417
gonna smack you into next week!

10:31.246 --> 10:33.668
I really hate anyone
who talks too much.

10:33.816 --> 10:35.863
It means
no one can hear me.

10:36.059 --> 10:39.552
Although it also means
you won't get any last words.

10:42.660 --> 10:44.809
I know you're here, Hulk.

10:46.627 --> 10:48.566
I can feel you.

10:49.783 --> 10:52.051
This is my chance
to finally be normal,

10:52.332 --> 10:54.067
to be me again,

10:54.324 --> 10:56.801
and to rid the world of you.

11:02.777 --> 11:04.343
Igneous polymer crystal.

11:04.559 --> 11:07.165
Twelve times stronger
than diamonds.

11:07.361 --> 11:11.131
You were never supposed to exist.
You were a mistake.

11:11.321 --> 11:14.286
You've always broken everything,
and I've had to fix it!

11:14.478 --> 11:17.868
But now?
Now I'm going to fix you.

11:27.439 --> 11:29.306
You want rid of me, huh?

11:29.423 --> 11:31.782
Now you know how I feel!

11:33.173 --> 11:35.041
Thermal chloride
is pretty painful.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.806
Here, take some more pain!

11:36.874 --> 11:38.220
Take all of it!

11:41.415 --> 11:42.454
Like that?

11:42.618 --> 11:44.689
Corrosive nanite pollen
from local flowers.

11:44.757 --> 11:46.306
Pretty smart, huh?

11:49.407 --> 11:51.165
You're nothing but
a destructive monster.

11:51.298 --> 11:52.876
I'm the smart one!

11:53.165 --> 11:55.294
You don't know how long
I've wanted to do this.

11:58.446 --> 12:00.978
Stay down,
you monster!

12:25.442 --> 12:28.227
You've already been slowly
destroying me for years.

12:28.314 --> 12:29.731
Go ahead.

12:30.270 --> 12:32.265
Finish me, you beast.

12:33.267 --> 12:35.950
Not a beast.

12:38.239 --> 12:41.348
I am you.

12:47.372 --> 12:49.387
You'll never be me.

13:20.309 --> 13:21.695
We have the Hulk.

13:21.833 --> 13:24.450
You don't need to hold my friends anymore.
Let them go.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.152
They attacked me.

13:26.387 --> 13:28.538
Besides, your friends

13:28.606 --> 13:30.770
don't seem
to like you very much.

13:36.197 --> 13:39.231
But since you've grown so
attached to them for some reason,

13:39.318 --> 13:41.734
I'll release Black Widow
and Captain Marvel

13:41.821 --> 13:43.762
after I'm done with the Hulk.

13:44.352 --> 13:48.411
I... I'm sorry,
Natasha, Carol.

13:48.976 --> 13:51.510
I'm sorry it's come to this.
Please understand.

14:03.425 --> 14:05.054
Are you having fun, Hulk?

14:05.122 --> 14:06.450
Not that it matters.

14:06.551 --> 14:09.044
What's important
is that I'm having fun.

14:09.636 --> 14:11.356
But I had better
get on with it.

14:11.661 --> 14:13.788
I have places to be,
things to do,

14:13.856 --> 14:17.044
worlds to conquer,
and a Hulk to disintegrate!

14:49.410 --> 14:51.278
It has to be this way.

14:52.075 --> 14:53.856
The Hulk needs to be destroyed.

14:55.083 --> 14:57.109
Destroyed?
Oh, no.

14:57.223 --> 15:00.045
I don't intend to let
such a monster go to waste.

15:00.132 --> 15:03.082
I'm going to absorb
his magical essence.

15:03.208 --> 15:08.489
Once it courses through me,
oh, it will be beautiful!

15:08.895 --> 15:10.817
You don't know
the Hulk like I do.

15:11.004 --> 15:13.223
You won't be able
to control his power.

15:13.387 --> 15:17.090
The only person who can do that is...
well, me.

15:17.464 --> 15:21.636
Well, it's a little late for that now,
isn't it?

15:22.152 --> 15:23.887
But this wasn't the plan, Morgan!
You'll...

15:23.958 --> 15:25.528
- You don't know what
- I don't care

15:25.596 --> 15:27.596
what you think, servant!

15:29.606 --> 15:32.411
I'm glad we could have
this little chat.

15:39.989 --> 15:42.176
And what do you think
you're doing?

15:42.378 --> 15:44.026
Fixing things.

15:47.883 --> 15:48.989
We have to stop her.

15:49.057 --> 15:51.086
- She's gonna use the Hulk to...
- We heard.

15:57.891 --> 16:01.159
Tsk, tsk.
Oh, Bruce.

16:01.227 --> 16:05.062
I guess you get to share
in the Hulk's fate.

16:09.227 --> 16:12.633
I call these my very angry horsemen.

16:31.125 --> 16:33.617
Leave the very
angry horsemen to me.

16:33.758 --> 16:36.125
Just find a way
to get through to the Hulk.

16:53.594 --> 16:54.883
Hey, horsey.

16:54.964 --> 16:56.313
Giddyap!

17:06.811 --> 17:08.211
You okay?

17:08.656 --> 17:10.009
I-I don't know anymore.

17:10.164 --> 17:11.711
Yeah, you do.

17:13.344 --> 17:14.895
Still trying to thwart me?

17:16.289 --> 17:18.797
Oh, I
almost feel bad for you.

17:18.969 --> 17:20.750
Only I don't!

17:37.664 --> 17:40.984
One, two... three!

17:43.703 --> 17:45.570
Using magic on magic.

17:45.821 --> 17:47.539
It's like you've
done that before.

17:47.726 --> 17:50.187
Not that I'd know,
since you won't share.

17:54.133 --> 17:57.163
Sorry about your little horseys.
They seemed nice.

17:57.288 --> 17:59.866
Not really up to the task,
but nice.

17:59.953 --> 18:04.004
Ech! It's like I have to do
everything myself!

18:25.527 --> 18:27.655
The gamma energy
didn't create you.

18:27.848 --> 18:30.507
It just brought out a side of me
that already existed.

18:31.007 --> 18:33.734
When I'd get frustrated about
not understanding something,

18:33.898 --> 18:35.983
it was the Hulk
that pushed me through.

18:36.252 --> 18:40.671
When someone stole my work, it was the
Hulk who made me stand up for myself.

18:41.296 --> 18:45.702
I'm sorry, Hulk. I'm sorry for
hating you all this time.

18:45.895 --> 18:48.978
Aw. Saying
your last good-byes?

18:49.616 --> 18:51.718
Better hurry.

18:58.085 --> 18:59.858
There is no you and me.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.218
It's us.

19:01.390 --> 19:04.952
And together,
we're incredible.

19:07.869 --> 19:09.818
No!

19:09.905 --> 19:12.574
Bruce! Hulk! No!

19:15.710 --> 19:17.535
This was never a fight
you could win,

19:17.603 --> 19:19.852
but it was cute
to watch you try.

19:24.920 --> 19:27.569
It's too late to save Bruce,

19:27.707 --> 19:30.257
but we can still stop Morgan!

19:42.480 --> 19:44.098
The green beast?

19:44.363 --> 19:45.957
But that's impossible!

19:47.004 --> 19:49.754
Hulk smash!

19:50.207 --> 19:53.457
I don't know how you bested
my disintegration spell,

19:53.647 --> 19:56.303
but you won't best this one!

20:02.657 --> 20:04.082
Where's Bruce?

20:04.270 --> 20:06.070
You're not gonna
find him there,

20:06.409 --> 20:08.121
if you know what I mean.

20:08.497 --> 20:10.855
I have no idea
what you mean.

20:10.952 --> 20:14.721
Your compassion for the green
monster has doomed you.

20:14.878 --> 20:19.496
Bad ending for you.
Happy ending for me!

20:22.110 --> 20:24.110
The evil witch
has left the building.

20:24.262 --> 20:26.180
Time for us to ghost.

20:35.769 --> 20:39.026
You know, I think I'm actually
gonna miss this place.

20:40.161 --> 20:42.043
So, anyone want
to explain to me

20:42.130 --> 20:43.597
what happened
to Bruce Banner?

20:43.738 --> 20:46.644
Carol, it's me.
All of me.

20:46.835 --> 20:49.302
It took Weirdworld
to make me understand.

20:49.621 --> 20:51.785
Hulk and Bruce Banner

20:51.946 --> 20:54.449
are just two halves
of the same person.

20:54.676 --> 20:56.695
Get out. So you're back!

20:56.816 --> 20:58.418
As a smart Hulk.

20:58.513 --> 21:01.684
- And Black Widow knew it right away.
- I did?

21:01.983 --> 21:04.684
Guess friends can be pretty
good at saying things

21:04.894 --> 21:06.786
without actually saying it.

21:06.973 --> 21:08.785
Thanks for coming to save me.

21:08.954 --> 21:11.543
It means a lot that
the Avengers would send...

21:11.851 --> 21:14.894
Wait.
Why did they send both of you?

21:26.035 --> 21:28.426
Aw, forget it.
Let's get outta here.

21:28.547 --> 21:30.289
This place is weird.
