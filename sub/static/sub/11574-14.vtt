WEBVTT

00:06.549 --> 00:08.961
Hey, Kenzi, where's
the sharpening stone?

00:11.762 --> 00:13.343
Kenzi?

00:42.418 --> 00:47.003
Hey, Kenz. | forgot that
you were taking off today.

00:47.089 --> 00:51.048
I hope you and Nate are having
fun living the rock InI ro|| dream.

00:51.135 --> 00:54.218
Anyway, I was just wondering how
many spoonfuls the coffeemaker takes

00:54.305 --> 00:56.261
and whether or not I should
become Lachlan's champion

00:56.349 --> 00:59.056
against this evil thing
that's coming our way.

01:04.732 --> 01:07.599
--Morning, Bo.
--Lachlan.

01:07.693 --> 01:11.481
Sorry to barge in but I need
you to do me a little favour.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.813
I need you to bring someone to me.

01:13.908 --> 01:16.775
Someone who has wisdom
on how to tackle our enemy.

01:20.957 --> 01:22.413
Who?

01:28.172 --> 01:30.379
That was amazing.

01:30.466 --> 01:35.176
I mean, it's totally unreal that
I'm actually here with Sadie.

01:35.263 --> 01:39.597
I mean, I have watched the
Lethal Grace series a hundred times.

01:39.684 --> 01:42.972
I mean, I can recite
every movie verbatim.

01:43.062 --> 01:49.228
Me and my friends, we measure up every
girlfriend we've ever had against you.

01:49.318 --> 01:51.479
If we had ever had any.

01:52.655 --> 01:54.737
That is so sweet.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.948
What is your website called?

02:03.416 --> 02:07.034
|t's cooler-than-thou-art.com.

02:07.128 --> 02:11.371
I mean, our readers are so stoked that
you're going to be in an R-rated film again.

02:13.509 --> 02:15.795
I do it all for you guys.

02:15.886 --> 02:19.925
I'm so lucky to have
such a devoted fan base.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.510
Are you all right?

02:22.601 --> 02:24.432
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine. Fine.

02:24.520 --> 02:29.560
I'm just--|'m so happy
that you're here with me.

02:29.650 --> 02:33.188
Don't worry, it happens all the time.

02:33.279 --> 02:38.273
I'm sorry. I just told myself
that I wasn't going to do this.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.985
[roaring]

02:50.504 --> 02:53.371
Hello. You with the headset?

02:53.466 --> 02:55.878
I think this guy's having a stroke.

02:58.804 --> 03:01.716
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.719
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

03:04.810 --> 03:07.722
My love carries a death sentence.

03:07.813 --> 03:09.895
l was lost for years,

03:09.982 --> 03:12.644
searching, while hiding,

03:12.735 --> 03:16.899
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

03:16.989 --> 03:21.858
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

03:27.458 --> 03:31.246
She's an Afreet. Sub-class of the Djinn.

03:31.337 --> 03:33.828
Like "genie in a bottle" Djinn?

03:33.923 --> 03:37.836
More like "trap her in a
magic lamp and force her

03:37.927 --> 03:39.667
to spill all her secrets,"
that kind of thing.

03:39.762 --> 03:42.344
You think she's knows
something about the Garuda?

03:42.431 --> 03:47.175
The Afreet are malevolent powerful
beings with such great, great wisdom.

03:47.269 --> 03:50.102
Well, can't we just ask her
advice? Wow, that is good.

03:50.189 --> 03:52.054
It's not bad, huh.

03:52.149 --> 03:56.768
Well, we could, yes, but the Afreet
will only cooperate if they're enslaved.

04:00.866 --> 04:04.324
Look, I am not into the
whole enslaving thing.

04:04.412 --> 04:07.279
I thought you'd have noticed,
given the whole Lauren situation.

04:08.457 --> 04:11.870
Sometimes, a leader has to
make very hard decisions.

04:13.838 --> 04:20.585
The doctor has a very important
role to play in the coming battle.

04:20.678 --> 04:26.594
And I've placed a tremendous amount
of faith in her ability to deliver.

04:26.684 --> 04:28.015
If we defeat the Garuda,

04:28.102 --> 04:32.391
then you and l, we can revisit
the whole Lauren situation.

04:32.481 --> 04:34.517
Oh, you know we will.

04:37.153 --> 04:40.395
The Afreet usually stay within
their own plain of existence.

04:40.489 --> 04:44.732
But this Sadie character has been crossing
back and forth now for millennia,

04:44.827 --> 04:48.365
causing a lot of mischief and a lot of
grief, so it's time she answered for it.

04:48.456 --> 04:51.163
So, you just want me to stroll onto
a movie set and kidnap a celebrity?

04:51.250 --> 04:55.664
No. It's better for you to catch
her unawares at the Swarga Lounge.

04:55.754 --> 04:59.463
She's been spotted there
every night this week.

04:59.550 --> 05:02.633
Okay, great. So, just hand
over the magic lamp.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.210
Well, you're going to have
to get that off Lambert.

05:04.305 --> 05:05.841
--Who's Lambert?
--Ryan Lambert.

05:05.931 --> 05:08.092
The guy that I sent to your
little birthday party.

05:08.184 --> 05:10.891
He's the inventor-type. He's actually
rather good with his hands.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.435
Of course, you sent him.

05:13.522 --> 05:14.682
Hoping you two hit it off.

05:14.773 --> 05:17.560
He's not really keen on parting
with his creations, you know.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.232
You are such a--

05:19.320 --> 05:24.565
I'm the Naga. With all
of Fae-dom to save.

05:24.658 --> 05:28.242
I'm counting on you
to be my champion.

05:31.874 --> 05:33.364
Baby steps.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.871
So, what did you see in your vision?

05:39.965 --> 05:41.626
The Garuda.

05:41.717 --> 05:44.424
The Garuda. They died
off a long time ago.

05:44.512 --> 05:45.843
Not all of them.

05:45.930 --> 05:50.139
All through the Great Fae War, this
Garuda was feeding on our violence,

05:50.226 --> 05:52.717
our hatred and we never knew it.

05:52.811 --> 05:54.312
Yeah, but you ended the war.

05:54.396 --> 05:57.229
I cut off its food supply,
but it didn't die.

05:57.316 --> 06:01.901
And like a starved dog, it's meaner
than ever and it's coming for me.

06:01.987 --> 06:05.024
--What's it want?
--It knows I was the Blood King.

06:05.115 --> 06:08.528
It wants me to unwrite the laws
so that it can start another war.

06:22.925 --> 06:24.506
[cell phone beeps]

06:30.015 --> 06:39.515
Ah, Kenzi. Bobolicious. A.W.H.F.Y.
Hell yes, will call A.S.A.F.P.

06:39.608 --> 06:46.901
L.Y.L.A.S. Kenzi. Ah.
Love you like a sister, too.

06:46.991 --> 06:49.778
[cell phone ringing]

06:49.868 --> 06:50.948
Hey, Trick.

06:51.036 --> 06:53.118
Bo. I know what's coming for us.

06:53.205 --> 06:55.036
Yeah. So do |. The Garuda.

06:55.124 --> 06:56.955
--How do you know that?
--Lachlan.

06:57.042 --> 07:00.034
But listen, I can't really talk right now
because I'm kind of on a mission for him.

07:00.129 --> 07:02.336
This is the same Lachlan you
wanted to kill yesterday?

07:02.423 --> 07:04.004
Well, a girl can change her mind, Trick.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.924
Indeed. Come see me
as soon as you can.

07:07.011 --> 07:08.467
lwill.

07:14.518 --> 07:16.179
What's up?

07:16.270 --> 07:21.936
I'm not sure. Lachlan's been confiding
in Bo. He's bound up in all of this.

07:22.026 --> 07:23.641
You think he's on our side?

07:23.736 --> 07:28.025
I don't know. And I
don't like not knowing.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.401
What about you? Everything all right?

07:31.577 --> 07:34.865
--Fine.
--You're nursing tea.

07:39.460 --> 07:42.793
When we went to see the Luduan,
I had a moment alone with her

07:42.880 --> 07:45.963
and she forced me to speak a truth.

07:46.050 --> 07:48.086
And...?

07:48.177 --> 07:54.218
I said, "I can't love Ciara."
Not that I don't, that I can't.

07:57.061 --> 07:59.768
I know this is difficult for you,

07:59.855 --> 08:04.269
but with the Garuda at our doorstep,
we need you at your best.

08:04.360 --> 08:07.397
If you can't love Ciara, then
you have to move past her.

08:07.488 --> 08:13.734
I don't want to move past her, Trick.
I had to move past Bo.

08:13.827 --> 08:17.820
And if there is anyone else in this world
that I should be able to love, it is Ciara.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.744
This just doesn't make any sense.

08:24.088 --> 08:28.081
Only you know what this all means.

08:28.175 --> 08:31.963
No, there's another.

09:14.304 --> 09:17.341
Hello? Hi. Hey.

09:17.433 --> 09:21.767
Bo. That bracelet
looks amazing on you.

09:21.854 --> 09:25.642
Well, I wear it all the time. I love it.

09:25.733 --> 09:28.645
Just wish you could have stuck
around the party a little longer.

09:28.736 --> 09:31.728
So, someone should have called
ahead for me about a lamp.

09:31.822 --> 09:35.189
Uh huh. Hey, hold this.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.244
I want you to hit me.

09:41.331 --> 09:42.195
Excuse me?

09:42.291 --> 09:46.330
This, cutting-edge technology.
It will protect me from all impacts.

09:46.420 --> 09:47.785
I won't feel a thing.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.871
Oh! Ah.

09:55.637 --> 09:58.094
--Needs a few tweaks.
--Hmm.

09:58.182 --> 09:59.797
l'll fix it.

10:03.145 --> 10:04.635
So, you're here for a lamp?

10:04.730 --> 10:06.186
Yes.

10:14.656 --> 10:20.743
Lamps. Lamps. Lamps.
This one is only half-finished.

10:20.829 --> 10:25.744
That one. That one... no that one's got
a spontaneous combustion problem.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.325
What kind of Afreet did you
say that you were looking for?

10:28.420 --> 10:29.751
The movie star type.

10:29.838 --> 10:33.831
Still, that's a long list.
Afreets love the spotlight.

10:33.926 --> 10:36.133
You know Sadie? Deadly Grace?

10:36.220 --> 10:38.381
--Lethal Grace.
--Yeah, whatever.

10:38.472 --> 10:41.760
Femme fatale. Devious, mercurial.

10:41.850 --> 10:45.138
Probably feeds on adoration.

10:47.272 --> 10:51.857
Ah! This one should do the trick.

10:51.944 --> 10:53.024
That is not a lamp.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.396
And you are not Aladdin.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.444
The whole lamp thing,
it's just a metaphor.

10:56.532 --> 10:59.990
You know genies don't
actually go inside this, right?

11:00.077 --> 11:05.617
Yeah, well, it's more like a
containment vessel. |t's complicated.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.789
Look, you do this...

11:11.672 --> 11:15.631
...and presto, your evil
Afreet is trapped.

11:15.717 --> 11:18.129
--|nside a music box?
--|t's not a music box.

11:18.220 --> 11:20.802
You've got to think of it...

11:20.889 --> 11:24.473
...in a way that's not
three-dimensional. Can you...

11:24.560 --> 11:28.803
Bottom line, when you marry ancient
science and modern Fae technology,

11:28.897 --> 11:30.979
you get some pretty surprising
and effective results.

11:31.066 --> 11:33.557
--Huh?
--G reat. Thank you.

11:33.652 --> 11:37.691
So, you just come in here,
you're dressed in your bracelet

11:37.781 --> 11:40.739
and you are trying to butter me up.

11:40.826 --> 11:44.660
Didn't even send me a thank you card,
by the way. I'm starting to feel used.

11:46.164 --> 11:48.416
You said it was from an admirer.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.206
You didn't even tell me who—

11:50.294 --> 11:52.080
You didn't even tell me
who the hell you were.

11:52.170 --> 11:55.162
Well, you're supposed to be some
kind of detective. Just saying.

11:55.257 --> 11:57.293
Are you going to give
me that thing or not?

11:57.384 --> 12:00.842
I don't give anything to anybody,
but I will sell it to you.

12:00.929 --> 12:02.760
How much?

12:02.848 --> 12:06.682
Well, for the Ash's errand girl,
I'll put it on the Ash's tab.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.724
I am nobody's errand girl.

12:08.812 --> 12:13.181
Sure. Here you go. Careful.

12:13.275 --> 12:15.140
Sometimes, it takes
a little bit of finesse.

12:15.235 --> 12:18.477
I can give you a workshop,
actually, over dinner?

12:18.572 --> 12:21.359
How about over my dead body?

12:21.450 --> 12:26.365
Hope not. That would be
a waste of a fine body.

12:26.455 --> 12:30.573
Well, you certainly have started a fire.

12:30.667 --> 12:34.205
Oh, yeah? Down there?

12:34.296 --> 12:35.411
Over there.

12:35.505 --> 12:39.168
Huh? Goddamn! Oh, man!

12:56.318 --> 13:00.436
[cell phone ringing]

13:00.530 --> 13:02.191
Hey, Kenz.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.945
Wha--no, I can't hear you.

13:06.036 --> 13:09.073
Yeah, I know it's loud. I can't hear you.

13:09.164 --> 13:11.576
Yeah, Kenzi, just move
away from the speaker.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.832
|--| got to go, Kenz. Bye.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.704
Stargazing.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.879
Bo!

13:23.971 --> 13:26.883
Get on over here, gorgeous. Come on.

13:32.604 --> 13:37.189
Sadie, this is Bo. She is an
extra special client of mine.

13:37.275 --> 13:40.688
I love your hair.
Where do you get it done?

13:40.779 --> 13:45.193
Oh, um... my bathroom.

13:45.283 --> 13:48.616
Well, then I'll have to send
my stylist to your bathroom.

13:49.871 --> 13:52.578
You're so pretty. What's your story?

13:52.666 --> 13:59.378
Um... well, I do mostly freelance,
um, you know, sort of...

13:59.464 --> 14:01.420
Well, you wouldn't be interested.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.796
Consulting. Bo is a consultant.

14:04.886 --> 14:09.220
High-level, hush-hush,
international intrigue, that kind of thing.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.218
It's very impressive.

14:11.309 --> 14:14.893
Love it. You are so adorable.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.561
Isn't she, though?

14:19.943 --> 14:21.149
Careful.

14:21.236 --> 14:26.776
Yeah. Excuse me. Hey. Hey, Ryan.

14:26.867 --> 14:29.483
--Hey, babe.
--Let me buy you a drink.

14:29.578 --> 14:32.411
--A drink?
--Be right back.

14:32.497 --> 14:36.115
How about a pint of what the
freaking hell are you doing here?

14:36.209 --> 14:37.369
I'm more of a bourbon man,

14:37.461 --> 14:38.826
--actually. Thank you.
--Hey, Ryan.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.421
--Hey, sweetie.
--Coming Saturday?

14:40.505 --> 14:43.622
Wouldn't miss it. Oh, no. I'm sorry.

14:43.717 --> 14:46.129
I got a lunch date in
Buenos Aires. Can't make it.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.755
I thought you're not
allowed back there?

14:47.846 --> 14:51.213
No. You're the one who's not
allowed back there, you minx.

14:51.308 --> 14:52.969
And the lovely lady is drinking...?

14:53.060 --> 14:54.220
I will have a water.

14:54.311 --> 14:55.221
--Su re.
--Water.

14:55.312 --> 14:58.270
And an explanation. Why are you here?

14:58.356 --> 15:00.642
A man is not allowed to
come to his favourite place

15:00.734 --> 15:03.191
and just drink and share a laugh?

15:03.278 --> 15:04.984
I'm not laughing.

15:05.072 --> 15:08.280
I noticed. Bit of a buzzkill, you know.

15:09.826 --> 15:12.989
You ran off without the user guide.

15:13.080 --> 15:17.449
And I never got your number.

15:17.542 --> 15:20.500
And you know, this whole
playing hard to get thing...

15:20.587 --> 15:24.125
I am not playing hard to get.

15:24.216 --> 15:26.457
I thought you said all I had
to do was turn the crank.

15:27.636 --> 15:30.343
I also said it takes finesse.

15:32.265 --> 15:35.098
Oh, and there's an incantation.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.096
Which is?

15:37.187 --> 15:40.145
I'll tell you if you let me watch.

15:40.232 --> 15:41.597
I've never seen an Afreet get trapped.

15:41.691 --> 15:45.479
Wha--What? You don't even
know if this is going to work?

15:45.570 --> 15:48.778
Well, the theory's sound.
Should be a piece of cake.

15:51.034 --> 15:57.621
But if it's not, you're going to want
me around, right? I mean, just in case?

15:57.707 --> 16:01.325
Fine. What is this incantation?

16:01.419 --> 16:03.375
Abracadabra!

16:05.590 --> 16:08.457
I'm a sucker for tradition, that's all.

16:16.351 --> 16:19.593
So, how long have you known her?

16:19.688 --> 16:21.019
Are you jealous?

16:21.106 --> 16:24.143
I'm not jealous. What can
you tell me about her?

16:24.234 --> 16:28.068
I don't really know what her powers are
exactly. It's different for every Afreet.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.897
But most can turn people into animals.

16:30.991 --> 16:33.698
Some can turn themselves
into fire-breathing dragons

16:33.785 --> 16:36.117
or inanimate objects. It's cool.

16:36.204 --> 16:39.446
--|t's a nice bag of tricks.
--Mhm.

16:39.541 --> 16:43.705
And every Djinn can be
controlled in one of two ways.

16:43.795 --> 16:47.663
One--stick him in a lamp.
Two---put your mark on him.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.008
What kind of mark?

16:49.092 --> 16:54.632
Primitive stuff like scars,
brands, tattoos, mutilation--

16:54.723 --> 16:57.715
Okay, let's just stick to the lamp, okay?

16:57.809 --> 16:58.924
What are you doing for breakfast?

16:59.019 --> 17:00.134
What?

17:00.228 --> 17:02.605
Jet's all gassed up. I know
this great café in Budapest.

17:02.689 --> 17:03.724
What are you doing for breakfast?

17:03.815 --> 17:08.809
Oh, wow. Are you actually trying
to pick me up with a private jet,

17:08.904 --> 17:11.941
--Yes.
--because, boy, did you misread me.

17:12.032 --> 17:15.274
Oh, come on. Every woman,
no matter how independent,

17:15.368 --> 17:18.405
secretly wants to be
taken care of, right?

17:18.496 --> 17:22.239
And every guy secretly
wants a boot to the face.

17:22.334 --> 17:23.790
Yeah.

17:26.963 --> 17:30.126
Dyson .

17:30.217 --> 17:34.802
Back to offer up another
sacrifice so soon.

17:34.888 --> 17:37.800
But you have nothing left that I want.

17:42.479 --> 17:47.018
What foolish deal do you
wish to make today?

17:47.108 --> 17:53.650
Don't speak to me of deals. You took
more than you claimed you would.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.948
He who has the manhood to
accuse a Norn of treachery

17:57.035 --> 18:05.625
may soon find himself
with no manhood at all.

18:14.052 --> 18:17.419
How did I wrong you, pup-pup?

18:17.514 --> 18:20.176
You said you were taking my love of Bo.

18:20.267 --> 18:23.384
You overreached. You took
my love of Ciara, as well.

18:23.478 --> 18:28.063
I took exactly what I said,
no more, no less.

18:28.149 --> 18:30.401
Speak plainly, crone.

18:34.906 --> 18:39.866
You know well that when a
wolf mates, he mates for life.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.989
When you gave your love
to this woman, this Bo,

18:42.080 --> 18:47.791
you gave her all of it,
which you then sacrificed to me.

18:47.877 --> 18:51.790
You have no love left to give.

19:12.444 --> 19:13.900
Bo, wait!

19:20.577 --> 19:22.693
Bo. Bo.

19:24.706 --> 19:26.662
Bo! Just wait up.

19:31.212 --> 19:34.249
Oh, deadly.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.047
This girl needs a doctor!

19:36.134 --> 19:37.795
Nothing any doctor can do for her now.

19:37.886 --> 19:40.172
And what, Sadie just teleported away?

19:40.263 --> 19:43.300
No. I still don't know what her skill is.

19:45.727 --> 19:51.768
You know, I was really hoping to
spend some more time with Sadie.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.940
You know, she just
seems so fascinating.

19:54.027 --> 19:56.268
Why are you following me?

19:59.491 --> 20:01.903
Sorry.

20:01.993 --> 20:03.733
Nothing personal.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.286
Abracadabra.

20:11.378 --> 20:12.618
No, the words have to
come with the music.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.873
--We|l, you didn't say that.
--We|l, I thought it was obvious.

20:14.964 --> 20:16.579
Abracadabra.

20:16.674 --> 20:18.005
No, you've got to start
over again. Just--

20:18.093 --> 20:19.173
--What?
--Just give it to me.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.637
--No.
--One sec. Let me just try that.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.177
Oh!

20:26.434 --> 20:28.675
No finesse whatsoever.

20:43.493 --> 20:48.829
What is this? You dickheads
stuck me in a lamp?

20:54.712 --> 20:57.749
Wow! Hot.

20:57.841 --> 20:59.001
Why don't we just talk this through,

20:59.092 --> 21:01.378
and then we can sit around
and toast marshmallows?

21:01.469 --> 21:04.085
No talk. Both burn.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.385
Uh, Ryan?

21:08.476 --> 21:10.888
There's a trigger for a
sliding wall right here.

21:13.648 --> 21:15.434
[BO] Huh?

21:15.525 --> 21:16.435
Use the bracelet.

21:16.526 --> 21:18.482
--What?
--Use the bracelet!

21:20.738 --> 21:22.524
Wasn't that worth a thank you card?

21:24.325 --> 21:25.280
Hold her off.

21:25.368 --> 21:28.030
Whatever you are doing,
could you hurry it up?

21:28.121 --> 21:29.657
You're doing great out there.
Just give me three more seconds.

21:29.747 --> 21:32.329
Those are three very long
seconds. A little help here.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.538
Will you hurry up?!

21:46.055 --> 21:49.218
That is a lot of stairs.
l'm sensing a theme.

21:49.309 --> 21:50.219
Yeah, it's a bit of maze in here.

21:50.310 --> 21:53.302
Helps keep the prisoners from
getting the lay of the land.

21:53.396 --> 21:54.602
What?

21:54.689 --> 21:57.806
Well, the driver's behind this wall,
but this wall is supposed to be a door.

21:57.901 --> 21:59.687
Oh, fantastic.

21:59.777 --> 22:05.613
Oh, man. What was I doing?
What was I doing when I built this?

22:07.952 --> 22:08.816
Oh, no.

22:08.912 --> 22:10.743
--What?
--Oh.

22:10.830 --> 22:14.743
l was sampling single malts,
trying to decide which distillery to buy.

22:18.004 --> 22:20.711
Well, there's a maintenance hatch in
every single one of these rooms. I'll find it.

22:20.798 --> 22:23.050
What kind of Fae did
you say you were again?

22:23.134 --> 22:25.420
I didn't.

22:25.512 --> 22:26.672
I'm a Loki.

22:26.763 --> 22:29.550
What? As in the Norse
god of mischief Loki?

22:29.641 --> 22:33.554
Not the Loki, a Loki.
There's a great big family of us.

22:33.645 --> 22:36.261
And the whole god thing,
that was just P.R. back in the day.

22:36.356 --> 22:38.722
You know, humans, they are
very, very, very gullible.

22:38.816 --> 22:40.727
And what about the
whole mischief thing?

22:40.818 --> 22:42.479
Oh, that part's true.

22:48.618 --> 22:51.735
Gears? This thing runs on gears?

22:51.829 --> 22:52.989
It's amazing, isn't it?

22:53.081 --> 22:55.788
God, I love being me.

22:55.875 --> 22:58.207
Hey, what about you,
I mean, succubus?

22:58.294 --> 22:59.795
Come on, how great is that?

22:59.879 --> 23:00.959
Well, actually, it's not
always so much fun--

23:01.047 --> 23:04.130
No, don't--don't spoil
my fantasies, please.

23:04.217 --> 23:08.335
I mean, feeding on sexual energy,
that is a diet that I can get behind.

23:08.429 --> 23:11.512
Hey, how does it work when
you pleasure yourself?

23:11.599 --> 23:15.467
Uh, buddy, we have not known each
other long enough for this conversation.

23:15.562 --> 23:19.350
No, no, seriously, I mean, when
you get hungry, you feed on sex.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.977
And sometimes you get
hungry, but you're all alone.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.059
Can you satisfy yourself?

23:25.321 --> 23:28.279
Now come on. When am I ever
going to meet another succubus?

23:31.286 --> 23:35.199
Actually, it makes me even hungrier.

23:35.290 --> 23:37.246
I can give you something for that.

23:39.377 --> 23:40.332
Did you just find us a way out?

23:40.420 --> 23:43.958
No, not yet. But I did turn the
outer shell into a wireless relay.

23:46.426 --> 23:49.714
Which means I can respond to the
500 texts my roommate has sent me.

23:49.804 --> 23:52.386
Or who do you have on speed dial?

23:57.061 --> 23:59.143
[cell phone ringing]

24:02.025 --> 24:03.231
--Bo?
--Dyson.

24:03.318 --> 24:05.400
l'm trapped in a magic lamp,
but it's not a lamp.

24:05.486 --> 24:07.442
--What?
--It looks like a music box.

24:07.530 --> 24:09.236
Just go with it. It's a metaphor.

24:09.324 --> 24:12.657
Anyway, the last time I saw it, it was in
the private room at the Swarga Lounge.

24:12.744 --> 24:15.110
--Bo, what the hell's going on?
--|t's a long story.

24:15.204 --> 24:18.332
Just get me out and I will share it
with you over many, many beers.

24:20.835 --> 24:23.668
Bo? Bo?

24:23.755 --> 24:25.962
Problem?

24:26.049 --> 24:28.165
Sounds like.

24:28.259 --> 24:31.342
Sorry, no surge protection.

24:31.429 --> 24:32.885
Hey!

24:38.227 --> 24:39.683
Come.

24:43.566 --> 24:45.477
--Going down?
--Never.

24:45.568 --> 24:47.024
Up it is.

24:59.165 --> 25:00.325
Where are we now?

25:00.416 --> 25:01.576
Top floor.

25:01.668 --> 25:02.748
The attic?

25:02.835 --> 25:06.669
Don't be so literal. It's a
Turkish bath spa kind of thing.

25:10.802 --> 25:13.919
Well, were you sober when
you designed this part?

25:15.682 --> 25:18.674
Uh, I guess not.

25:21.688 --> 25:24.725
Oh, great! What do we do now?

25:24.816 --> 25:26.602
Well, try not to use
up too much oxygen

25:26.693 --> 25:30.185
because there's not a lot
of ventilation in here.

25:30.279 --> 25:32.486
l'll fix this.

25:32.573 --> 25:35.110
Yeah.... yeah.

25:35.201 --> 25:36.657
[RYAN] Okay.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.160
Oh, god, it's...

25:42.667 --> 25:44.123
Fixing this.

26:08.151 --> 26:11.063
Ow!

26:11.154 --> 26:14.817
I thought you were supposed
to be good at this stuff?

26:14.907 --> 26:18.946
I am good. You know
how I know I'm good?

26:19.036 --> 26:21.527
Because I built a trap that
even I can't get out of.

26:21.622 --> 26:23.283
Oh, that's so comforting.

26:23.374 --> 26:26.411
Hey! What's your problem?

26:26.502 --> 26:30.745
We're on a genie hunt here.
Aren't you having any fun?

26:30.840 --> 26:32.751
This isn't some adventure.

26:32.842 --> 26:34.878
All of Fae-dom depends on me.

26:34.969 --> 26:37.676
ReaHy?

26:37.764 --> 26:41.552
Wow! I mean, someone takes
themself a little seriously.

26:43.519 --> 26:48.980
Maybe, a bit. The Ash
is wearing off on me.

26:49.066 --> 26:52.854
Hey, what's the deal
with you two, anyway?

26:52.945 --> 26:55.527
He kind of sort of wants
me to be his champion.

26:55.615 --> 26:56.980
It's the word he keeps using.

26:57.074 --> 26:59.406
I think it sounds more
like being owned by him.

26:59.494 --> 27:01.109
Well...

27:06.834 --> 27:10.452
I mean, it makes sense
that he wants you.

27:10.546 --> 27:12.047
You're awesome.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.920
--Thanks.
--No, really.

27:17.011 --> 27:21.755
You don't want to be owned and
that's what's amazing about you.

27:21.849 --> 27:23.680
When you go out trying
to save the world,

27:23.768 --> 27:26.851
you're not doing it for the Light or
the Dark, you're doing it for you.

27:28.523 --> 27:33.358
You put your ass at risk, it's not
because you're someone's puppet.

27:33.444 --> 27:36.231
You do it because it's your ass to risk.

27:39.325 --> 27:43.910
Guess l'd ride to hell and
back to support that.

27:43.996 --> 27:47.488
Plus, ljust really hate being bored.

27:47.583 --> 27:49.619
I'm a total idiot.

27:49.710 --> 27:51.371
Wait a minute.

27:54.298 --> 27:56.334
l was pulling the wrong gear.

28:04.100 --> 28:06.887
I give you our exit strategy.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.061
Grab your jacket.

28:23.953 --> 28:25.409
Just--

28:35.006 --> 28:36.962
[RYAN screaming]

28:38.009 --> 28:40.546
There's your exit strategy, darling.

28:44.056 --> 28:46.889
And now it's your turn.

28:50.730 --> 28:52.015
Nicely done.

28:52.106 --> 28:54.563
Our only chance of escape
just got the shaft.

28:54.650 --> 28:56.390
Don't you know your stories?

28:56.485 --> 29:00.103
There's always some chump
coming along to rub a magic lamp

29:00.197 --> 29:02.279
and make a bad deal with a genie.

29:02.366 --> 29:03.651
We're stuck here now.

29:03.743 --> 29:06.860
What? No, that's impossible.

29:06.954 --> 29:10.492
I need to be out there in
the world, adored by humans.

29:10.583 --> 29:11.572
How will I feed?

29:11.667 --> 29:15.159
That's a good question. You just
killed the guy who built this.

29:20.468 --> 29:24.086
Wait. What are you doing?

29:24.180 --> 29:28.765
Screw you. Screw this
lamp. I'm done here.

29:28.851 --> 29:29.840
Done how exactly?

29:29.936 --> 29:32.678
l'll burn so hot, l'll destroy everything.

29:32.772 --> 29:36.105
No! No, you can't.

29:36.192 --> 29:38.899
Not when I finally have my
chance to spend time with you.

29:38.986 --> 29:40.442
What?

29:43.491 --> 29:45.277
Are you a fan?

29:45.368 --> 29:49.702
Oh, I am your number
one fan. I love you.

29:49.789 --> 29:52.872
You are the greatest
star that ever lived.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.416
Not feeling it.

29:59.298 --> 30:02.005
Must have something to do with that.

30:16.440 --> 30:17.941
How's that?

30:18.025 --> 30:27.195
Better. Now tell me, what's your
favourite thing that I've done? Hmm?

30:28.995 --> 30:30.451
Uh...

30:32.039 --> 30:35.406
I can't believe it.
This really is a prison lamp.

30:40.089 --> 30:42.956
And it's broken. |f Bo is trapped--

30:43.050 --> 30:44.665
You'll free her.

30:44.760 --> 30:49.379
It would require an
alchemist's skill to fix this.

30:49.473 --> 30:52.385
The Afreet is powerful
and we have her trapped.

30:52.476 --> 30:55.013
If we can contact her,
we can control her.

30:55.104 --> 30:56.810
Not while the lamp's broken.

30:56.897 --> 30:58.637
Well, what the hell do we do, Trick?

30:58.733 --> 31:01.315
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

31:01.402 --> 31:04.109
Y'all know I got perfect pitch, right?

31:16.459 --> 31:18.700
Yeah, I know the song.

31:21.714 --> 31:26.174
[whistling]

31:26.260 --> 31:29.002
I cried so hard when
you died at the end.

31:29.096 --> 31:32.964
And then when you came back
to life, I cried even harder.

31:36.645 --> 31:40.604
You should have seen
me in my theatre days.

31:40.691 --> 31:47.403
Oedipus Rex. Sophocles wrote the
part of Jocasta for me, you know.

32:06.967 --> 32:09.174
--Bo?
--Dyson?

32:09.261 --> 32:10.671
What's going on in there?

32:10.763 --> 32:15.223
I'm trapped. I'm trying to keep
an Afreet from going super nova.

32:15.309 --> 32:17.300
Where is the Afreet now?

32:17.394 --> 32:21.387
She's here. And she is so wonderful.

32:23.275 --> 32:27.644
You like me. You really like me!

32:37.373 --> 32:38.954
Bo?

32:39.041 --> 32:44.877
I'm letting her feed off me to try to keep
her happy, but it hurts, Trick, it hurts.

32:44.964 --> 32:46.920
H-How do I fight her?

32:47.007 --> 32:50.090
Djinns do the bidding of the
one who controls the lamp.

32:50.177 --> 32:52.589
Bo doesn't control the lamp.

32:52.680 --> 32:54.090
Neither do we.

32:54.181 --> 32:56.342
Oh, no. There's another way.

32:56.433 --> 32:58.014
How do I put my mark on her?

32:58.102 --> 33:00.468
Through branding, scarring, tattoos.

33:00.563 --> 33:02.895
But the mark has to be personal.
It has to be charmed.

33:02.982 --> 33:06.520
l have an idea. Get me back inside.

33:06.610 --> 33:09.192
Hale, Siren the tune backwards.

33:09.488 --> 33:14.448
[whistling]

33:22.376 --> 33:25.243
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

33:25.337 --> 33:28.044
It's just being with you
is so overwhelming.

33:29.758 --> 33:31.544
| get that a lot.

33:31.635 --> 33:36.880
You know what would really make
my dreams come true? One kiss.

33:38.767 --> 33:42.180
How could I refuse such a fan?

34:00.122 --> 34:01.703
Who's your daddy, bitch? Huh?

34:01.790 --> 34:02.870
No way.

34:02.958 --> 34:04.334
Yeah. I'm afraid so.

34:04.418 --> 34:07.034
You got something you
want to say to me?

34:07.129 --> 34:10.621
Your wish is my command, mistress.

34:10.716 --> 34:12.547
A girl could get used
to the sound of that.

34:12.635 --> 34:15.968
Your mark will fade eventually,
and then we'll see who's laughing.

34:16.055 --> 34:19.547
We'll be laughing from
the outside of this lamp.

34:22.853 --> 34:24.764
I thought you were dead.

34:27.316 --> 34:29.102
I told you I'd fix it.

34:32.571 --> 34:34.107
Well, now that you got
the genie under control,

34:34.198 --> 34:37.531
nice work by the way, we can use her.

34:37.618 --> 34:40.860
The main power supply
is way, way down there.

34:40.955 --> 34:46.200
Just command her to burn hot
as she can straight down.

34:46.293 --> 34:47.794
This whole place will go boom.

34:47.878 --> 34:49.118
That sounds painful.

34:49.213 --> 34:54.082
Might be. Or might be that
we get released unharmed.

34:54.176 --> 34:56.918
--Fifty-fifty.
--Fifty-fifty?

34:57.012 --> 34:59.594
You rather stay here forever with me?

35:00.933 --> 35:02.798
Burn it. Burn it all.

35:26.041 --> 35:29.454
--Bo?
--| 'm right here.

35:29.545 --> 35:35.165
Hey. It's a nice crib. Could
use a little colour though.

35:35.259 --> 35:39.252
Thank you, guys. I'll give you
the whole debrief later, okay?

35:51.567 --> 35:53.273
Was that Lethal Grace?

35:55.154 --> 35:57.440
There was supposed to be
a lamp in this equation.

35:57.531 --> 36:01.115
I don't set foot in a lamp for
less than a million dollars.

36:01.201 --> 36:03.658
Here's the deal--you get the
info that you need from her

36:03.746 --> 36:05.236
and then she goes free.

36:05.331 --> 36:06.446
She's dangerous.

36:06.540 --> 36:07.780
|'|| command her to go
back to her own plain,

36:07.875 --> 36:09.957
where she'll never hurt anyone again.

36:10.044 --> 36:11.909
And you'll never get your hands on her.

36:12.004 --> 36:14.416
--There's a battle coming.
--Yeah, I know.

36:14.506 --> 36:19.045
And that battle is only worth winning
if we keep being the good guys.

36:19.136 --> 36:22.754
We don't take slaves.

36:22.848 --> 36:25.009
So, you've decided to be my champion?

36:25.100 --> 36:29.685
No. I won't. I've gone this long
without playing by anyone's rules

36:29.772 --> 36:31.854
and I'm not going to start now.

36:35.569 --> 36:38.561
Maybe I didn't clearly
articulate what's coming after us.

36:38.655 --> 36:40.395
No, | get it.

36:40.491 --> 36:43.528
And I will face it with you,

36:43.619 --> 36:45.484
as your partner.

36:47.748 --> 36:49.704
Hey, it's my mark on her.

36:54.046 --> 36:55.627
Partners.

37:07.726 --> 37:11.059
If I'd known engineering paid so well,
I never would have dropped math.

37:11.146 --> 37:14.889
--Thanks for that.
--The Ash sends his thanks.

37:14.983 --> 37:17.645
So, was he able to get what
he wanted from Sadie?

37:17.736 --> 37:20.603
I don't know. I didn't
ask and he didn't say.

37:20.697 --> 37:23.939
So, after what we went through,
I certainly hope so.

37:26.620 --> 37:30.909
|... I had a good time.

37:30.999 --> 37:33.786
It was weird, but fun.

37:39.508 --> 37:45.094
From where l was standing, that was the
best night that l have had in a decade.

37:45.180 --> 37:47.171
Thank you.

37:47.266 --> 37:50.133
So, let me take you out now.
Show you a good time.

37:50.227 --> 37:52.934
Come on.

37:53.021 --> 37:59.688
|, um... I've just come through some
pretty complicated emotional stuff.

37:59.778 --> 38:04.738
So, thank you, but I have to pass.

38:04.825 --> 38:06.281
Okay.

38:09.621 --> 38:12.533
For the record,

38:12.624 --> 38:14.831
you are the most enthralling, inspiring

38:14.918 --> 38:19.708
and seriously ass-kicking
person that l have ever met.

38:19.798 --> 38:23.256
And I would be happy to
make sure you knew that

38:23.343 --> 38:25.800
every second that l
was in your company.

38:25.888 --> 38:29.301
If you ever invite me in
your company again, that is.

38:29.391 --> 38:30.892
--Wow.
--A|so,

38:30.976 --> 38:33.592
I don't come with any baggage.
And I'm not really interested in yours.

38:33.687 --> 38:36.429
So, clean slate?

38:38.525 --> 38:40.106
That's refreshing.

38:44.239 --> 38:49.700
So, if I hear from you again,
or if I don't,

38:49.786 --> 38:53.870
I'll be thinking about you. Bye.

39:07.513 --> 39:08.798
I'm sorry.

39:08.889 --> 39:10.345
l'll fix it.

39:22.861 --> 39:26.274
Dyson. Thought I'd find you here.

39:26.365 --> 39:29.027
Where have you been?
Why haven't you returned my calls?

39:29.117 --> 39:32.575
I meant to. It's been crazy.

39:32.663 --> 39:35.075
Things always are with you.

39:35.165 --> 39:37.372
What's going on, Dyson? Talk to me.

39:37.459 --> 39:38.539
Not here.

39:38.627 --> 39:41.619
Enough! Stop putting me off.

39:41.713 --> 39:44.329
Say whatever it is you need
to say right here, right now,

39:44.424 --> 39:48.258
or I'll fly to Zurich and I'll stay there
and you'll never get the chance.

39:49.805 --> 39:55.721
I learned today that there's
something broken inside of me.

39:55.811 --> 39:57.847
It's a thing that can't be fixed.

39:57.938 --> 39:59.053
What happened?

39:59.147 --> 40:02.310
I went to see a Norn.

40:02.401 --> 40:04.483
I know about the Norn.

40:04.570 --> 40:07.858
I heard the rumours and I don't
blame you for Stephan's death.

40:07.948 --> 40:09.813
I'm glad you didn't deal with
the Norn, no one ever should.

40:09.908 --> 40:15.574
I did deal with her. Just not then.

40:15.664 --> 40:19.407
It was recently to save Bo's life.

40:20.168 --> 40:22.295
What did she take?

40:22.379 --> 40:30.218
I offered her my wolf,
but she took my love instead.

40:30.304 --> 40:37.016
No. No. No.

40:37.102 --> 40:41.266
I did what I had to do. I'm sorry.

40:41.356 --> 40:44.018
Everyone knew? Trick? Hale?

40:44.109 --> 40:48.398
No. I'm the only one who wears this.

40:48.488 --> 40:51.104
No one else.

40:51.199 --> 40:56.284
Ciara, I can't... I can't love you.

40:56.371 --> 40:58.202
But I swear if I could, I would.

40:58.290 --> 40:59.871
Just don't.

41:03.337 --> 41:08.957
You couldn't give up your wolf to
save your best friend, my husband,

41:09.051 --> 41:11.463
who you knew for a hundred years.

41:11.553 --> 41:12.963
But you were willing
to give up your wolf

41:13.055 --> 41:16.513
for this woman you've
known for a few months?

41:16.600 --> 41:19.683
You were willing to give
up everything for her?

41:21.480 --> 41:23.061
Yes.

41:25.567 --> 41:31.187
You should have told me right
from the start. And you know it.

41:31.281 --> 41:32.896
You're not the man I thought you were.

41:32.991 --> 41:34.822
Ciara, please.

41:34.910 --> 41:37.196
Don't. Just don't.

41:47.547 --> 41:49.048
--Oh my god.
--Wow.

41:49.132 --> 41:52.590
Wow. Wow. Wow. That was...

41:52.678 --> 41:55.169
--Uh huh.
--Holy cow.

41:55.263 --> 42:01.008
That thing you did with the
sucking the chi and the blowing...

42:01.103 --> 42:03.719
And it is true, you are
very good with your hands.

42:03.814 --> 42:06.351
Thank you.

42:06.441 --> 42:10.104
You know, inhibitions, theyjust,
they get in the way, don't they?

42:13.699 --> 42:17.738
Wait. Have you ever
been with one of us?

42:20.455 --> 42:21.911
Am | your first?

42:21.998 --> 42:23.659
First what?

42:23.750 --> 42:25.365
You don't know, do you?

42:25.460 --> 42:27.997
What?

42:28.088 --> 42:30.374
l'm Dark Fae.

42:30.465 --> 42:32.171
--What?!
--|'m Dark Fae.

42:32.259 --> 42:39.347
No. No, no. I mean, I assumed because
you were working with the Ash that...

42:39.433 --> 42:42.470
| work with a lot of
people that I shouldn't.

42:42.561 --> 42:44.267
That's why we're good together.

42:44.354 --> 42:46.731
I'm like you.

42:46.815 --> 42:47.725
There are no rules.

42:47.816 --> 42:50.102
That is perfect. Just perfect.

42:50.193 --> 42:52.184
--I thought you were unaligned.
--I am.

42:52.279 --> 42:54.691
So, what's the problem?
Do you think all Dark Fae are bad,

42:54.781 --> 42:56.066
all Light Fae are good? Is that it?

42:56.158 --> 42:58.991
No, it's just the Dark have
not exactly been my B.F.F.s.

42:59.077 --> 43:02.615
Well, I'm not defined by my clan.

43:02.706 --> 43:05.618
Listen, there are no rules here.

43:05.709 --> 43:10.578
No strings attached.
You want to walk? Go ahead.

43:19.473 --> 43:25.139
Well, with the way my legs are shaking,
I don't think I could right now.

43:28.732 --> 43:30.347
No rules.
