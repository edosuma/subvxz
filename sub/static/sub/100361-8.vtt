Nick?

00:52.469 --> 00:54.054
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:54.554 --> 00:55.513
[exhales]

00:55.889 --> 00:57.932
I know I've missed dinner.

00:59.601 --> 01:02.520
Mrs. Skolka, thank God you're home.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.397
[scoffs] What's this?

01:04.814 --> 01:06.024
What does it look like?

01:07.984 --> 01:09.652
A hostage situation?

01:11.404 --> 01:13.907
Um, may...? May I be excused?

01:13.990 --> 01:15.909
-You don't have to ask--
-Yes, you may.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.411
Well, thank you for a lovely evening.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.371
There's an apple tart in the oven.

01:23.249 --> 01:26.002
Again, I... I apologize.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.046
You know, Frankie had a thing.

01:28.129 --> 01:29.881
Frankie always has a thing.

01:29.964 --> 01:33.093
I have one thing.
I want to spend time with my wife.

01:33.176 --> 01:36.721
As affectionate as Chef Bert is,
somehow, it-it's just not the same.

01:36.805 --> 01:40.892
I want more time with you, too.
And I promise you I'll make it up to you.

01:40.975 --> 01:42.852
Fine. You can start on Thursday.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.270
Absolutely.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.314
What-- What's Thursday?

01:46.815 --> 01:49.359
We leave for Hawaii.
The Food and Wine Festival.

01:49.442 --> 01:50.443
Oh, God.

01:50.985 --> 01:52.362
That's next weekend?

01:53.404 --> 01:55.907
Saturday is Frankie Fest 2020.

01:55.990 --> 01:58.868
Okay, just because Frankie
gave her birthday a name

01:58.952 --> 02:00.078
doesn't make it a festival.

02:00.161 --> 02:03.164
But I've been appointed grand marshal.
I have a hat.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.750
And we've planned this vacation
for months.

02:05.834 --> 02:06.960
I know.

02:07.043 --> 02:10.463
And I was incredibly excited about it
until I forgot.

02:10.547 --> 02:13.133
But it's just, you know
how crazy Frankie gets.

02:13.216 --> 02:16.678
Yeah, I was at Frankie Fest 2019.
In fact, I sponsored it.

02:16.761 --> 02:18.721
Shouldn't that get us off the hook
for this year?

02:18.805 --> 02:23.643
Missing her birthday to go to a place
with a chocolate lazy river?

02:24.477 --> 02:26.563
I mean, that's a double whammy!

02:30.650 --> 02:34.195
This is the part where you say,
"Well, why don't we just bring Frankie?"

02:36.239 --> 02:37.949
I see you're not saying that.

02:38.032 --> 02:41.744
This was supposed to be
a romantic getaway. No third wheels.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.038
Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:44.122 --> 02:46.833
Frankie's got her own wheel.
His name is Jack.

02:46.916 --> 02:48.126
We could bring them both.

02:48.209 --> 02:49.502
Celebrate her big day,

02:49.586 --> 02:52.422
and then send them both down
the chocolate river to their own villa.

02:52.505 --> 02:55.592
I don't know. I met Frankie's
last boyfriend, and his rattail.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.302
Where did this one wash up from?

02:57.385 --> 02:59.137
From your charity event.

02:59.220 --> 03:02.223
Still... I don't want to go away
with a guy I don't know.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.602
How about we all have dinner
tomorrow night?

03:05.685 --> 03:08.062
That way you can get to know Jack
for yourself.

03:08.146 --> 03:12.025
And if the two of you hit it off,
then we pull the trigger on Hawaii.

03:12.108 --> 03:13.318
And if we don't?

03:14.444 --> 03:16.237
I'll have to give back the hat.

03:19.657 --> 03:21.534
-No, they charge for it.
-Just throw that away then.

03:21.618 --> 03:22.911
-They charge us.
-And we won't--

03:22.994 --> 03:25.121
Uh, look what Dan just brought me.

03:26.581 --> 03:28.625
I don't like this.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.418
[Mallory] You guys are so cute.

03:30.501 --> 03:32.503
Yes. What could be cuter
than two grown men

03:32.587 --> 03:34.214
wearing bibs that say "Beef Brothers"?

03:34.297 --> 03:35.590
Come on, get pumped.

03:35.673 --> 03:37.800
Besides, our short rib
is already waist-deep in marinade.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.136
It's T-minus 22 hours
until short rib o'clock.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.554
Up top!

03:42.805 --> 03:44.390
Okay, we'll let you two get back to it.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.517
Hey, are we still on
for the Flower Fields before dinner?

03:46.601 --> 03:47.977
Totally jazzed.

03:48.061 --> 03:51.564
I might have to get down on all fours
just to really smell the blooms.

03:53.149 --> 03:54.567
-Bye.
-Smell the blooms.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.319
-Not in the bib.
-Oh, okay.

03:56.402 --> 03:59.030
Um, we're gonna go stretch our stomachs
for tomorrow.

03:59.113 --> 04:00.240
Okay, let's go.

04:01.115 --> 04:02.158
So cute.

04:02.700 --> 04:05.161
You know that was all bullshit
about him loving the flowers

04:05.245 --> 04:06.955
and smelling the blooms, right?

04:08.039 --> 04:09.958
It was his idea to go.

04:11.167 --> 04:14.128
Right. That's because you're
in the early part of your relationship

04:14.212 --> 04:17.090
when he's pretending
to like everything that you like.

04:17.799 --> 04:20.385
He's not pretending. We just happen
to like the same things.

04:20.802 --> 04:22.845
-Like what?
-Like...

04:22.929 --> 04:25.515
hot yoga, pistachio gelato,
<i>The Joy Luck Club.</i>

04:25.598 --> 04:28.017
Okay, if he says
he likes <i>The Joy Luck Club,</i>

04:28.101 --> 04:30.019
then you haven't even met him yet.

04:30.103 --> 04:33.231
-What?
-What straight man likes a sweeping drama

04:33.314 --> 04:35.733
about women reckoning
with maternal sacrifice?

04:35.817 --> 04:37.277
He's evolved!

04:37.610 --> 04:41.197
Sorry I'm not as cynical as you,
but Dan is who he says he is.

04:42.865 --> 04:44.534
-Okay.
-Okay.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.912
-And who's his favorite musician?
-Ed Sheeran. Oh...

04:48.579 --> 04:49.998
I think we're done here.

04:51.499 --> 04:54.711
Frankie Fest, Hawaii Edition. [gasps]

04:54.794 --> 04:56.671
I love that idea!

04:57.046 --> 05:01.467
I knew there was a reason
I made you grand marshal.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.886
This is much bigger, though,
than Frankie Fest.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.388
Oh, bite your tongue.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.974
No, imagine, Nick and Jack become friends,

05:08.057 --> 05:11.227
and the four of us all hang out,
all the time.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.395
Even in the bath?

05:12.854 --> 05:14.022
Not in the bath.

05:14.105 --> 05:16.733
Okay, we'll hash out that specific later.

05:16.816 --> 05:19.819
Look, the point is,
you and I will never have to choose

05:19.902 --> 05:22.030
between our fellas and each other.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.824
But wait. What if the guys
don't hit it off tonight?

05:24.907 --> 05:28.661
Oh, they will hit it off,
because we're gonna make them hit it off.

05:28.745 --> 05:32.123
And if worst comes to worst,
I've always got Twister

05:32.206 --> 05:35.501
and four tabs of acid in the linen closet.

05:35.585 --> 05:39.464
This could really lead
to all kinds of couple adventures.

05:39.547 --> 05:43.134
Yes! After Hawaii, we could swing by Japan

05:43.217 --> 05:47.722
to soak in the hot springs
with snow monkeys.

05:47.805 --> 05:50.141
We'll hash out that specific later.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.938
"Reggie Teinert is survived
by his wife, Dorothy,

05:56.022 --> 06:00.234
their four children,
and 12 grandchildren."

06:00.318 --> 06:01.486
Poor things.

06:02.445 --> 06:03.571
"Their names are--"

06:03.654 --> 06:05.698
Is this really necessary, Sol?

06:06.407 --> 06:10.203
Robert, we are going
to this memorial service,

06:10.286 --> 06:12.622
and my decision is final, and--

06:12.955 --> 06:14.290
Was I convincing that time?

06:14.374 --> 06:18.461
No. Because for the fifth time,
I do not remember this guy.

06:18.795 --> 06:22.131
That's why they have photo displays
at funerals.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.801
And to honor the deceased, of course.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.219
We'll catch the next one.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.596
But you and Reggie served together.

06:28.679 --> 06:30.723
Over 50 years ago!

06:30.807 --> 06:34.435
What about his widow? She went
to all that trouble of tracking you down.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.104
Maybe she's just like one of those mothers

06:36.187 --> 06:38.606
who invites everyone in the class
to her son's birthday.

06:38.689 --> 06:43.611
Robert, I've thought about this
a lot lately, and when my day comes--

06:43.694 --> 06:45.696
-Sol!
-Whether from cancer

06:45.780 --> 06:49.617
or the stress of trying to pick
the fastest moving line at Whole Foods,

06:49.700 --> 06:52.620
I hope folks show up for me.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.084
Fine. But we sit in the back,

06:58.167 --> 07:00.420
and we leave during the closing hymn.

07:00.795 --> 07:04.382
These things are really just
about putting butts in seats.

07:04.841 --> 07:08.052
And honoring the deceased, of course.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.137
Of course.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.935
Hey, so let me ask you something,

07:16.018 --> 07:18.271
and you have to promise
to be totally honest.

07:18.354 --> 07:21.732
-Great, that sounds ominous.
-No, no, it's nothing bad.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.403
So, you know how we both love
<i>The Joy Luck Club?</i>

07:25.486 --> 07:26.571
Oh, yeah.

07:26.654 --> 07:28.156
What's your favorite scene?

07:30.158 --> 07:32.285
I really couldn't pick a favorite.

07:32.368 --> 07:33.494
Pick one.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.831
[exhales] Okay, um...

07:36.914 --> 07:39.625
Oh, uh, y-you know that...
that awesome one...

07:39.709 --> 07:43.087
uh, where you first see...

07:44.672 --> 07:45.715
Joy Luck.

07:46.048 --> 07:48.426
-Joy Luck is not a person!
-Oh, shit.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.763
You don't even like Ed Sheeran, do you?

07:53.264 --> 07:55.224
I hate his voice, hate his face.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.309
[exhales]

07:56.392 --> 07:59.604
So you were just saying all that stuff
because you thought I would like it?

07:59.687 --> 08:02.690
Has no man ever done this to you before?

08:02.773 --> 08:05.193
I know I'm punching above my weight here.

08:05.276 --> 08:08.613
Look, I like you. I just--
I want to know the real you.

08:08.696 --> 08:12.033
-Why? I thought we had a good thing going.
-[laughs]

08:12.116 --> 08:13.284
-I just...
-[laughs]

08:14.619 --> 08:16.162
I don't want to screw it up.

08:16.245 --> 08:19.415
Won't we screw it up
if we're not being ourselves?

08:20.458 --> 08:21.959
Here, I'll start.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.377
I hold grudges.

08:24.295 --> 08:26.714
Margo Clark stole my boyfriend in college,

08:26.797 --> 08:31.552
and I just left her waxing studio
a bad Yelp review.

08:32.428 --> 08:35.431
I might have used the words
"staph infection."

08:35.890 --> 08:37.475
[laughs]

08:38.392 --> 08:39.268
Your turn.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.269
[laughs]

08:40.353 --> 08:42.480
I don't hold grudges.

08:42.855 --> 08:48.236
But I have been told I have
a difficult time admitting I'm wrong.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.072
I strongly disagree, obviously.

08:51.822 --> 08:53.616
Look at us being real.

08:54.283 --> 08:55.117
[Dan chuckles]

08:55.201 --> 08:57.453
Does this mean we can bail
on the flower thing?

08:57.537 --> 08:59.497
Or are you gonna hold a grudge?

08:59.580 --> 09:00.998
Till the day you die.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.334
Oh, all right. All right. Yay, flowers.

09:04.460 --> 09:05.795
-[smooches]
-[Jack] Ah.

09:05.878 --> 09:08.506
You, sir, are a sight for old eyes.

09:08.589 --> 09:09.757
You're not so bad yourself.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.425
Hey, Jack. [slight chuckle]

09:11.509 --> 09:12.760
Oh. [chuckles]

09:13.719 --> 09:15.471
Are you grooming me?

09:15.555 --> 09:17.974
It's just a little thing we do
for all our dinner guests.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.267
How cosmopolitan.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.727
Jack, could I get you some water, or...

09:21.811 --> 09:24.564
or tea, or... maybe a quieter tie?

09:25.356 --> 09:26.607
What's happening here?

09:26.691 --> 09:29.068
Nothing. You've never worked
for the IRS.

09:29.151 --> 09:31.028
-Is that correct?
-Correct.

09:31.112 --> 09:34.407
And, uh, when Nick comes,
be sure to make eye contact.

09:34.865 --> 09:36.659
He thinks it's a sign of strength.

09:36.742 --> 09:39.704
And it's always better to be
a good listener than a good talker.

09:39.787 --> 09:41.581
Pop quiz. What did I just say?

09:41.914 --> 09:44.333
Uh, I'm... I'm picking up
a weird vibe here.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.587
Yeah. I'm sorry, Jack.
We want tonight to... to go really well,

09:47.670 --> 09:49.880
and Nick is kind of a hard sell.

09:49.964 --> 09:52.174
-Oh, ladies, relax.
-[Frankie chuckles]

09:52.258 --> 09:54.010
I'm the guy
that convinced Capitol Records

09:54.093 --> 09:56.929
to let Garth Brooks do
the "Chris Gaines" album.

09:57.305 --> 10:00.224
If I could sell that soul patch,
I could sell anything.

10:00.308 --> 10:02.268
Wasn't that whole thing
a complete disaster?

10:02.351 --> 10:04.729
I told Garth it was a bad idea!

10:05.479 --> 10:09.066
-Ugh, great, now I'm sweating.
-Just be yourself.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.610
Without that tie.

10:11.736 --> 10:15.114
All I know is
I was on Facebook two days ago,

10:15.197 --> 10:17.033
and now they won't let me back in.

10:17.116 --> 10:20.620
As your begrudging IT specialist,
I ask that you own your part in this.

10:20.703 --> 10:23.998
-I feel that Facebook hates me.
-[Bud groans]

10:24.081 --> 10:26.292
Okay, now your password is reset.

10:28.044 --> 10:31.672
"Frankie's dying, but I can't watch.
I'm in too much pain."

10:32.340 --> 10:33.507
Dad? Why?

10:33.591 --> 10:38.929
She was dying of laughter
at that hilarious Marge video,

10:39.013 --> 10:41.265
"When an ostrich attacks."

10:41.349 --> 10:43.351
Except you didn't
actually post Marge's video.

10:43.434 --> 10:46.520
And now someone named Nan Jo Steen
is sharing memories of Mom

10:46.604 --> 10:48.439
and asking when she can bring a casserole.

10:48.522 --> 10:49.732
Oh, no.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.984
Can we fix this?

10:52.318 --> 10:55.363
Just be glad that most
of your Facebook friends are cats.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.448
[Robert clears throat]

10:57.531 --> 10:59.325
[exhales] How do I look?

11:00.660 --> 11:03.579
Great. Just lose the shades
when we get to the funeral home.

11:03.663 --> 11:07.625
Oh, no, they stay on,
so no one can see I'm not crying.

11:09.251 --> 11:10.127
[camera clicks]

11:11.879 --> 11:12.963
[Frankie exhales]

11:16.425 --> 11:20.221
[exhales] Nick, did you know
that Jack was in the music business?

11:20.304 --> 11:21.347
That's right.

11:25.267 --> 11:28.646
Go on, honey.
Tell him what kind of music you like.

11:29.355 --> 11:32.191
Uh, you know, all kinds.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.986
No way.
Jack likes all kinds of music, too.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.780
What a coincidence.

11:37.863 --> 11:40.658
If it hadn't just happened,
I wouldn't have believed it. [chuckles]

11:41.659 --> 11:43.035
[Frankie clears throat]

11:43.119 --> 11:46.247
Nick, did you know
that Jack used to be super rich?

11:46.330 --> 11:48.916
That's terrible. I'm so sorry.

11:49.375 --> 11:53.546
Well, you should know better than anyone
that money can't buy you happiness.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.634
He's joking. [stammers] It's a joke.

11:58.718 --> 11:59.677
[Grace laughs]

12:02.096 --> 12:06.225
Grace and I are thinking we should all go
to Japan and soak with the snow monkeys.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.602
We haven't hashed out that specific.

12:08.686 --> 12:09.729
In Nagano...

12:09.812 --> 12:11.564
[speaking Japanese]

12:14.316 --> 12:16.777
-Are you fluent in Japanese?
-[chuckles]

12:16.861 --> 12:22.116
Would you say I was fluent if I could walk
into the biggest record label in Tokyo

12:22.199 --> 12:27.079
and negotiate a landmark deal for Yoko Ono
in her native Japonic language?

12:27.163 --> 12:28.330
Wow.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.667
Then... no. They had absolutely no idea
what I was saying.

12:31.751 --> 12:35.045
-[all laugh]
-And Yoko did not come out on top.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.298
-[all laugh]
-But I loved being over there.

12:37.381 --> 12:39.508
Japanese baseball is my religion.

12:40.050 --> 12:42.928
Get out! I'm a Yomiuri Giant.
What's your team?

12:43.012 --> 12:44.930
Oh. The Nippon-Ham Fighters.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.140
-Obviously.
-Oh.

12:46.599 --> 12:50.019
But I did once catch a home run hit
by Sadaharu Oh.

12:50.102 --> 12:53.481
Broke my hand.
Best compound fracture of my life.

12:54.023 --> 12:56.442
Nothing. I got nothing.

12:58.694 --> 13:00.863
[exhales] Still nothing.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.866
Maybe you were his senior officer?

13:03.949 --> 13:05.701
A wartime role model?

13:06.076 --> 13:09.538
I was the ship's weatherographer,
and I never left the Caribbean.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.707
The greatest contribution
I made to the war

13:11.791 --> 13:14.418
was telling hungover sailors to buck up.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.212
And maybe those were precisely the words

13:16.295 --> 13:19.340
a young, impressionable Reggie
needed to hear.

13:22.092 --> 13:24.178
-Hello, I'm Sol.
-Sol.

13:24.261 --> 13:27.431
-And this is Robert from the Navy.
-[gasps]

13:27.515 --> 13:29.225
Robert! [gasps]

13:29.308 --> 13:30.392
Oh!

13:32.311 --> 13:34.146
Finally, we meet.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.439
My condolences.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.608
Thank you so much for coming.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.860
We saved a seat for you right up front.

13:39.944 --> 13:40.903
Oh, no, no, no.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.197
We'd hate to intrude on family.

13:43.280 --> 13:45.991
Oh, hush. You practically are family.

13:46.367 --> 13:47.910
Uh, sir,

13:48.911 --> 13:52.414
could you show Robert and Sol
to their seats?

13:52.498 --> 13:53.707
[slight exhales]

13:56.252 --> 13:58.254
Where did you two sneak off to?

13:58.337 --> 14:02.466
I had my booze concierge
deliver a vintage bottle of Yamazaki.

14:02.550 --> 14:06.345
Wow, Nick doesn't get the Yamazaki
for just any man.

14:06.428 --> 14:08.889
I hope not. It's a hundred dollars a sip.

14:08.973 --> 14:09.974
-Ooh.
-[Nick] Jack.

14:10.057 --> 14:12.393
-You've been to Hawaii, right?
-[Jack] Ooh.

14:12.476 --> 14:15.521
How would you two like to join us there
for Frankie's birthday next weekend?

14:15.604 --> 14:16.438
[gasps]

14:16.522 --> 14:19.483
There's a food and wine soiree,
all-star lineup.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.819
And we can have Emeril whip up a cake.

14:21.902 --> 14:24.530
Are you serious? I love Emeril!

14:24.613 --> 14:25.573
-Bam!
-Oh!

14:25.656 --> 14:30.870
Oh, Nick, I love that spontaneous idea
that just came to you all on your own.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.580
Oh, so it's a plan.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.540
-Here's to Hawaii!
-[Jack chuckles]

14:34.999 --> 14:36.250
-[Nick] Hawaii.
-Hawaii.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.209
[Grace] To Hawaii.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.919
To the Fab Four!

14:39.336 --> 14:42.256
[gasps] We should all get
matching haircuts.

14:42.339 --> 14:43.883
-[Grace chuckles]
-[knocking]

14:44.216 --> 14:46.343
[stammers] I'll get it. Goodness.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.765
[Frankie] Is this an aphrodisiac?

14:51.849 --> 14:53.642
Jac-Jacob? What are you doing here?

14:53.726 --> 14:54.977
I'm here to see Frankie.

14:55.603 --> 14:58.063
Oh, well, unfortunately,
it's not a good time.

14:58.147 --> 14:59.273
[Jacob] I know.

14:59.356 --> 15:02.693
I saw the news on Facebook.
That's why I came.

15:02.776 --> 15:05.696
On Facebook? What... What do you mean?

15:05.779 --> 15:08.866
-I'm so sorry, Grace.
-Uh...

15:10.993 --> 15:11.952
[Frankie chuckles]

15:12.411 --> 15:13.454
Frankie!

15:14.204 --> 15:15.039
Frankie!

15:16.457 --> 15:17.416
Oh!

15:18.417 --> 15:19.335
Jacob.

15:20.127 --> 15:21.211
[Jacob] Oh, Frankie.

15:23.339 --> 15:27.092
Jacob is Frankie's former yam... supplier.

15:27.176 --> 15:29.595
-Oh.
-[Grace] Apparently just in from Santa Fe.

15:29.678 --> 15:31.305
-[Frankie exhales]
-[Grace] Uh...

15:32.014 --> 15:36.185
-How are you feeling, Frankie?
-Well, um, okay, all things considered.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.812
I... I'm, uh... I'm a little bloated.

15:38.896 --> 15:41.065
My knees hurt. My back, too.

15:41.148 --> 15:42.900
It doesn't like to be upstaged.

15:42.983 --> 15:44.985
Oh, my hearing is shot.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.987
It's all falling apart, really.

15:47.529 --> 15:50.366
Jacob. Jacob, you remember Nick.

15:50.449 --> 15:53.619
And this is Jack, Frankie's boyfriend.

15:53.702 --> 15:56.789
They're getting very serious,
and we're all going to Hawaii together.

15:57.665 --> 16:01.043
-You always did live life to the fullest.
-[Frankie exhales]

16:01.126 --> 16:02.211
Oh.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.004
Yeah, he's going in for another one.

16:09.259 --> 16:11.011
[Barry] And when you make the reservation,

16:11.095 --> 16:15.057
they let you pick out
the specific rib you're going to eat.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.684
Oh, wait. Where are our rib bibs?

16:16.767 --> 16:20.854
Oh, no. They must have gotten burned
when I lit them on fire.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.731
But Mallory said we looked so cute.

16:22.815 --> 16:23.774
I lied.

16:23.857 --> 16:26.652
[chuckles] I love it when you are honest
about lying.

16:27.152 --> 16:28.153
Your cabernet.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.949
Oh, actually, these are the wrong glasses.

16:32.032 --> 16:34.201
-I'm sorry, I'll--
-These are Bourgogne glasses.

16:34.284 --> 16:37.246
They're used for more complex
and velvety reds.

16:37.329 --> 16:40.124
Oh, it's going to be a long night.

16:40.207 --> 16:42.501
I apologize. Just one moment.

16:42.584 --> 16:44.044
[Dan] Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

16:45.504 --> 16:49.675
I'm sorry. I used to wait tables,
so I guess I have high standards.

16:50.300 --> 16:53.137
You know what? You were right.
I'm glad you said something.

16:53.220 --> 16:56.223
And I'm glad our waiter's
going to go spit in our food.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.393
I'm gonna see if he needs anything.

17:02.938 --> 17:04.106
Jordy!

17:04.189 --> 17:07.735
I have loved Reggie since I met him.

17:08.652 --> 17:11.488
And I will never stop loving him.

17:12.448 --> 17:16.493
We are blessed to have
someone very special with us.

17:18.328 --> 17:19.371
Robert?

17:22.374 --> 17:25.085
Robert, would you say a few words?

17:26.712 --> 17:29.423
It would mean so much to Reggie.

17:31.383 --> 17:34.136
You should probably go
with the "buck up" story.

17:34.678 --> 17:35.804
[exhales]

17:42.936 --> 17:45.606
What the hell is Jacob doing here?

17:46.106 --> 17:50.819
And where the "H" did I hide
my emergency Starburst?

17:50.903 --> 17:54.281
You gnawed through it all
during the broadcast of <i>Peter Pan LIVE!</i>

17:54.364 --> 17:56.033
I wanted it to succeed.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.285
Unlike someone I know.

17:58.660 --> 17:59.828
Hey.

17:59.912 --> 18:03.499
Jacob said he saw the news on Facebook.

18:03.582 --> 18:04.917
What... What could that mean?

18:05.000 --> 18:09.296
I did post a selfie of me and Jack
on our two-month textiversary.

18:09.379 --> 18:11.507
It might have gone viral. I wouldn't know.

18:11.590 --> 18:15.803
I spilled Hawaiian Punch
all over my MacBook, and it dead.

18:15.886 --> 18:19.348
That's it. I will bet you
a purse full of Starburst

18:19.807 --> 18:22.768
he found out you're in a relationship,
and he can't handle it.

18:22.851 --> 18:23.852
You think?

18:24.394 --> 18:26.438
You haven't heard from Jacob
since you broke up.

18:26.730 --> 18:30.109
Now he shows up the minute you have
a new boyfriend? [annoyed chuckle]

18:30.192 --> 18:32.903
[exhales] It is weird
he didn't phone first.

18:32.986 --> 18:34.655
I could've been in Japan.

18:34.738 --> 18:37.074
And boy, he laid it on thick.

18:37.866 --> 18:39.326
He even hugged me.

18:39.409 --> 18:40.536
He hates me!

18:40.619 --> 18:41.662
That's true.

18:42.162 --> 18:45.124
But it's unlike Jacob
to resort to hug warfare.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.960
Oh, he's a man.
It's typical male behavior.

18:48.043 --> 18:49.753
Only wanting what they can't have.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.797
Well, of course he still wants me.

18:51.880 --> 18:55.884
If anything, he's a victim,
helpless against my enchantments.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.010
[Frankie exhales]

18:58.220 --> 19:01.390
Do you really have
a purse full of Starburst?

19:01.682 --> 19:03.142
So, Jacob, how are you?

19:03.684 --> 19:07.187
I just can't help but be angry with God.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.275
Frankie, you're happy with Jack, right?

19:11.567 --> 19:13.318
Like Bill Murray in a photobomb.

19:13.402 --> 19:16.405
Yeah. Then you have to get back in there
and send Jacob packing.

19:16.488 --> 19:19.533
Now? In the night? In the dark?

19:19.616 --> 19:21.451
You don't want Jack to get the wrong idea

19:21.535 --> 19:23.704
now that things
are starting to fall into place.

19:24.121 --> 19:28.750
N-Now that Nick loves Jack,
we're this close to having it all.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.295
That guy is sucking all the air
out of that room.

19:31.378 --> 19:33.589
I feel like he's coming for my lungs next.

19:33.672 --> 19:36.717
-Preaching to the choir here, fella.
-Jack, on the other hand...

19:36.800 --> 19:39.052
Frankie, what a catch.

19:39.136 --> 19:41.763
Yeah. It's worth protecting,
don't you think?

19:41.847 --> 19:42.890
[grunts in frustration]

19:42.973 --> 19:47.227
Man alive, how many times
do I have to break up with this guy?

19:49.104 --> 19:52.316
There was a heaviness
aboard the ship that day.

19:52.399 --> 19:54.610
-Morale was low.
-[organ playing]

19:54.693 --> 19:57.613
-There was a tropical storm...
-This is Henson, right?

19:58.113 --> 20:00.240
-Palm trees swayed violently...
-Hanson, actually.

20:00.324 --> 20:01.241
Right.

20:01.658 --> 20:04.411
It's amazing to be able to put a face
to the story.

20:04.494 --> 20:06.622
-The story?
-Then I found Reggie on the main deck.

20:06.705 --> 20:09.291
He's probably too proud to talk about it.

20:09.374 --> 20:12.961
I mean, to pull Reggie
out of the bombed-out ship

20:13.295 --> 20:16.590
moments before it sank
into the port of Saigon.

20:17.549 --> 20:21.386
I approached him, and I said, "Hello."

20:22.137 --> 20:25.641
And that would be the Vietnamese Saigon?

20:25.724 --> 20:28.143
Not... Not the Caribbean one?

20:28.936 --> 20:30.479
[Robert] I could tell he was tired.

20:30.562 --> 20:32.314
I looked into Reggie's eyes,

20:33.106 --> 20:36.151
the eyes of youth, of innocence,

20:36.526 --> 20:37.861
of fear,

20:37.945 --> 20:39.071
of war.

20:39.863 --> 20:40.948
And I said...

20:41.740 --> 20:42.991
"Buck up."

20:43.784 --> 20:46.411
And by God, did he buck up.

20:46.828 --> 20:49.039
He bucked up for himself that day,

20:49.998 --> 20:53.043
but he also bucked up for America.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.474
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.518
-Really moving, sir.
-Thank you.

21:09.601 --> 21:11.103
There's been a mistake.

21:11.186 --> 21:12.145
Wonderful speech.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.273
They think you're Henson, not Hanson.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.984
Henson, Hanson. We were all brothers, Sol.

21:17.401 --> 21:20.112
Well, one brother doesn't remember Reggie,

21:20.195 --> 21:23.115
and the other brother
pulled his unconscious body

21:23.198 --> 21:24.700
from the bloodied waters

21:24.783 --> 21:27.244
while Viet Cong bullets whizzed by.

21:27.703 --> 21:31.581
Which brother do you think
was invited to do the eulogy?

21:33.250 --> 21:34.293
[exhales]

21:34.960 --> 21:37.421
This is punishment for leaving the house.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.424
[Barry gasps]

21:40.507 --> 21:42.175
There she is.

21:42.259 --> 21:44.511
There's my lady rib. [chuckles]

21:44.594 --> 21:45.887
I love you so much.

21:47.514 --> 21:49.141
Thank you, Jordy.

21:49.433 --> 21:52.894
It means the world to us
that you, you know, brought this over.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.730
Just doing my job.

21:54.813 --> 21:56.148
That's what all heroes say.

21:56.231 --> 21:58.817
Okay. Hey, you need to settle.

21:59.985 --> 22:02.821
Okay, so, this five-pounder
was smoked for eight hours

22:02.904 --> 22:05.866
-at 180 degrees.
-One hundred and eighty degrees.

22:05.949 --> 22:06.825
[Barry chuckles]

22:06.908 --> 22:09.911
Isn't this supposed to be a savory brown?

22:10.495 --> 22:12.247
'Cause what I'm seeing is black.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.082
-Oh, shit.
-He was a waiter.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.084
He has a great eye for meat.

22:16.501 --> 22:21.006
Uh, what you're seeing is a lightly
charred surface, finished with--

22:21.089 --> 22:24.009
-Scallion oil.
-I think I know burnt when I see it.

22:24.092 --> 22:26.595
And you've got
that great eye for meat, so...

22:26.678 --> 22:29.181
It's not burnt. It's charred.

22:29.264 --> 22:30.182
Hmm. Hmm.

22:30.265 --> 22:31.558
Well, those are synonyms.

22:31.641 --> 22:34.561
No. No, they're not.
They're different words.

22:34.644 --> 22:35.854
Don't worry, I got this.

22:36.396 --> 22:37.939
I think we're gonna have
to send this back.

22:38.023 --> 22:42.110
No! No, we're not. All the other ribs
are taken. Tell him, Jordy.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.446
Barry is correct, sir.
This is the last one.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.365
Uh, this one is fine, right? This is fine.

22:46.448 --> 22:48.075
-No, it's not!
-This is fine. This is fine.

22:48.158 --> 22:50.077
It's not. We paid good money for this.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.703
Well, actually, Barry paid--

22:51.787 --> 22:52.662
[gasps]

22:52.746 --> 22:55.082
-[gasps]
-And it is burnt.

22:55.457 --> 22:57.000
You'll see when I cut into it--

22:57.084 --> 22:59.378
Oh, no, no! I... I will cut into it.

22:59.461 --> 23:02.464
And you know what I'm gonna see
when I get in there, huh?

23:02.547 --> 23:04.549
Burnt stuff! Yeah.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.385
Dan. Dan, don't--

23:07.469 --> 23:08.595
Aha! Ha!

23:09.471 --> 23:11.681
See? See? What color is that? Hmm?

23:11.765 --> 23:13.308
[all] Savory brown.

23:13.392 --> 23:14.851
Sir, I'm afraid you're wrong.

23:14.935 --> 23:18.105
I am not wrong! It is scorched!

23:18.188 --> 23:19.147
Look!

23:19.231 --> 23:20.232
[all gasp]

23:20.941 --> 23:21.942
[yells] Dude!

23:22.025 --> 23:23.110
What the fuck?

23:25.153 --> 23:26.988
[stifled laugh] Jordy, more wine.

23:32.911 --> 23:35.288
I hate to be the one to tell you this,

23:35.956 --> 23:37.499
but you're too late.

23:38.500 --> 23:39.876
It's moving that fast?

23:39.960 --> 23:44.714
Hey, at our age,
you have to make every minute count.

23:45.340 --> 23:46.758
You're so brave.

23:47.467 --> 23:49.469
Oh, how am I supposed
to compete with that?

23:49.553 --> 23:53.598
He grows his own vegetables,
and I travel with two inhalers.

23:53.682 --> 23:57.394
But you've got new guy energy.
That guy's angry at God.

23:57.477 --> 23:59.312
You're fine. Yeah, it's fine.

23:59.396 --> 24:01.731
Let's keep our eye on the prize, people.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.400
-Frankie?
-Hawaii?

24:03.483 --> 24:05.527
We will have both.

24:06.987 --> 24:09.906
So, have you... got a second opinion?

24:09.990 --> 24:11.783
Well, in matters like this, I...

24:11.867 --> 24:14.411
I like to think
that I'm the final authority.

24:14.494 --> 24:18.081
But if you must know, Grace and Nick
are pretty stoked on it.

24:19.124 --> 24:20.917
What the hell does that even mean?

24:21.001 --> 24:23.670
Fine, I'll say it. They're Team Jack.

24:24.296 --> 24:28.884
And Grace is right, you only came sniffin'
around because I'm off the market.

24:28.967 --> 24:32.512
Frankie. I didn't come here
because you're dating someone.

24:32.596 --> 24:33.555
You didn't?

24:33.638 --> 24:36.558
I came here
because I found out you're dying.

24:40.854 --> 24:42.856
Could you repeat that last part?

24:43.940 --> 24:44.774
[exhales]

24:46.318 --> 24:49.696
Looks like it's my turn to buck up.

24:50.322 --> 24:53.533
Thank you again.
That was quite the speech.

24:53.909 --> 24:55.952
Dorothy, I have to tell you something.

24:56.036 --> 24:58.788
It's not too late.
We can still get out of here.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.249
Is what Robert said to Reggie,

25:01.333 --> 25:03.710
as he was stabbing a shark
and pulling him to safety.

25:03.793 --> 25:05.295
It's okay, Sol.

25:06.671 --> 25:08.840
I am not who you think I am.

25:09.591 --> 25:11.801
I'm Robert Hanson, not Henson.

25:11.885 --> 25:17.224
The Robert Hanson that attended
basic training in NTC San Diego in '63?

25:17.307 --> 25:20.685
Well, yes. But I am not the man
who saved your husband.

25:20.769 --> 25:23.355
I know that. That was Henson.

25:23.438 --> 25:26.733
And between us, he turned out to be
a bit of a jackass.

25:27.067 --> 25:30.278
Can we say that about a war hero?

25:30.362 --> 25:31.738
Bless his heart.

25:31.821 --> 25:33.406
Sure, we're forever grateful,

25:33.490 --> 25:35.700
but he lorded that over Reggie
his whole life.

25:35.784 --> 25:39.538
He even guilted us
into funding his son's student film,

25:39.621 --> 25:42.082
which turned out to be pretty offensive.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.710
Then why did you reach out to me,
of all people?

25:47.003 --> 25:48.922
Reggie never told you, did he?

25:49.005 --> 25:51.925
-Hmm?
-He struggled all through basic training.

25:52.008 --> 25:54.553
And one day, when he already had
two strikes against him,

25:54.636 --> 25:57.097
he forgot to polish his shoes.

25:57.180 --> 26:00.850
And when the commander came in
to inspect them, they were perfect,

26:00.934 --> 26:03.270
because someone

26:03.853 --> 26:05.480
had shined them for Reggie.

26:06.147 --> 26:07.732
I did. [slight chuckle]

26:07.816 --> 26:10.193
Robert does love a shiny shoe.

26:10.694 --> 26:12.487
If Reggie had failed that inspection--

26:12.571 --> 26:14.614
They would have revoked his liberty.

26:15.240 --> 26:18.410
Well, I am glad he was able
to get off the base that weekend,

26:18.493 --> 26:21.955
but what I did was hardly an act of valor.

26:22.038 --> 26:25.417
Sweetie, that was the weekend he met me.

26:25.500 --> 26:26.418
[gasps]

26:26.501 --> 26:29.337
We were married for 50 years.

26:29.546 --> 26:31.965
He told our kids that story all the time.

26:32.048 --> 26:35.844
You taught us how far
a little kindness can go.

26:37.512 --> 26:39.097
Oh, you've got to meet everyone.

26:39.180 --> 26:41.057
Let me go and corral the troops.

26:41.766 --> 26:42.892
Junior!

26:44.519 --> 26:47.981
Henson saved his life,
but Hanson gave him one.

26:49.357 --> 26:51.610
-I just can't believe it.
-Why?

26:52.027 --> 26:54.446
You've been looking after me for 30 years.

26:54.529 --> 26:56.948
Only because I didn't think
you were looking.

27:02.996 --> 27:04.122
[Sol] Aww.

27:04.205 --> 27:05.206
Oh!

27:08.877 --> 27:10.962
He said we were beef brothers.

27:12.297 --> 27:14.007
He put on a fucking bib.

[cell phone chimes]

27:18.011 --> 27:19.971
-[Mallory groans]
-How many apologies is that?

27:20.305 --> 27:22.098
Ten text messages,

27:22.182 --> 27:24.017
17 facepalm emojis,

27:24.100 --> 27:28.396
and however many times he said,
"I am such a fuck-knuckle,"

27:28.480 --> 27:31.316
as security escorted him out.

27:32.609 --> 27:33.652
[sighs]

27:34.069 --> 27:36.071
These are very heartfelt, though.

27:38.031 --> 27:40.825
You can't keep seeing him.
You know that, right?

27:41.284 --> 27:43.203
He assassinated our dinner.

27:43.286 --> 27:44.579
May it rest in peace.

27:44.663 --> 27:47.624
-It's not like he punched a person.
-Even worse.

27:47.707 --> 27:49.668
He punched a short rib.

27:50.043 --> 27:52.295
Nobody's perfect, right?

27:52.921 --> 27:54.839
And he's so good with the kids.
Oh, my gosh.

27:54.923 --> 27:57.801
-He punched a short rib.
-Yeah.

27:58.134 --> 28:00.053
I know. I know. It's just...

28:00.762 --> 28:02.889
Now I have to start all over
with someone else?

28:02.972 --> 28:04.849
Listen, on the plus side,

28:04.933 --> 28:07.602
you get to drag a new person
to see those dumb flowers.

28:07.686 --> 28:11.648
And you get to have lots of hot sex
to the sounds of Ed Sheeran.

28:12.691 --> 28:13.858
You guys seeing this?

28:14.401 --> 28:17.696
Table 12 didn't finish their rib.
[chuckles]

28:20.782 --> 28:22.158
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

28:24.494 --> 28:25.870
Thank God.

28:25.954 --> 28:28.915
I think I've been holding my breath
since I saw Sol's post.

28:28.998 --> 28:31.209
Well, I feel like just kicking him
in the shins

28:31.292 --> 28:33.002
for putting you through all this.

28:33.086 --> 28:35.213
I can't imagine how I would feel

28:35.296 --> 28:38.258
if I found out I was dying via Facebook.

28:38.341 --> 28:42.637
I was so shaken. I was standing in line
to buy a green-chile torta

28:42.721 --> 28:44.389
when I saw it on my phone.

28:44.472 --> 28:46.474
I walked out of the market, got in my car,

28:46.558 --> 28:49.561
and drove 13 hours straight here.

28:49.644 --> 28:52.439
You walked away from a Santa Fe Sammich...

28:52.814 --> 28:54.816
during peak chile season...

28:55.400 --> 28:56.818
just for me?

28:56.901 --> 28:57.944
Frankie.

28:58.027 --> 28:59.654
Of course I did.

29:00.613 --> 29:02.240
-Oh!
-[chuckles]

29:04.367 --> 29:07.871
Yeah. Okay, it's...
it's a dynamic situation,

29:07.954 --> 29:11.040
but we have to dictate the tempo.
You have to up your game.

29:11.124 --> 29:13.376
-Do you have any candy in your pocket?
-What? No.

29:13.460 --> 29:17.255
What? He just said I had new guy energy.

29:17.338 --> 29:21.259
I know I did, buddy. But now it's up
to you to breathe life into those words.

29:24.345 --> 29:27.515
I cannot believe you drove
all the way here,

29:27.599 --> 29:30.852
and now you've got to drive
all the way back.

29:31.478 --> 29:34.272
Let me get you a can of gas for the road.

29:35.857 --> 29:38.568
I'm not going back to Santa Fe just yet.

29:38.943 --> 29:40.028
You're not?

29:41.154 --> 29:43.656
Grace was right about one thing.

29:43.740 --> 29:46.367
I didn't know what I had
until it was gone.

29:47.160 --> 29:50.955
And I am not gonna make
that same mistake again.
