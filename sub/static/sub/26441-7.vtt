- A lot.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.353
Kandokan labour laws.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.636
Ever since the People Power
protest movements,

09:59.280 --> 10:02.432
companies have to make sure
a minimum 10% of the workforce

10:02.520 --> 10:05.115
are actual people, at all levels.

10:05.640 --> 10:09.270
Like the slogan says,
real people need realjobs.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.233
Work gives us purpose, right?

10:11.320 --> 10:12.720
Some work, maybe.

- AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>Product incoming.</i>

10:15.840 --> 10:20.790
If I ever get bored, I imagine
customers opening their parcels

10:20.880 --> 10:22.633
back on Kandoka.

10:23.680 --> 10:25.114
Their big smiles.

10:25.760 --> 10:27.752
I only ever got a present the once,
but...

10:28.640 --> 10:30.472
Oh, I can never forget how it felt.

10:31.360 --> 10:35.149
Like... Like a little box of happiness.

10:35.680 --> 10:36.680
(LAUGHS)

10:38.000 --> 10:39.434
Just one present your whole life?

10:40.360 --> 10:42.033
My birthday last year.

10:42.120 --> 10:45.272
A little box of chocolates
from Judy, our Head of People.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.553
Oh, it was so amazing.

10:48.680 --> 10:51.752
What about your mum and dad,
didn't they ever get you a present?

10:51.840 --> 10:52.990
Never knew them.

10:53.760 --> 10:58.710
But I can still imagine
families opening these packages.

10:59.600 --> 11:02.991
We make them happy
by doing what we do here.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.196
(CHUCKLES)

11:04.560 --> 11:07.155
You have a great approach to life, Kira.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.195
Thank you.

11:10.200 --> 11:13.318
That's so lovely of you. Nobody's ever
said something that nice to me.

11:17.640 --> 11:20.109
Where are these packing slips
generated from?

11:20.200 --> 11:24.513
I don't know. They just arrive here
on little instruction slips.

11:25.920 --> 11:28.515
Kira, have you ever met anyone here
who's worried?

11:29.120 --> 11:30.236
Or needs help?

11:34.480 --> 11:35.480
Help with what?

11:35.560 --> 11:37.313
- I don't know.

Word of advice,
the TeamMates can hear everything.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.394
- If they choose.
- Everything?

11:47.480 --> 11:50.075
Constant random monitoring.

11:50.160 --> 11:51.753
No such thing as privacy here.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.319
Are you from the union? Is that it?

11:55.760 --> 11:57.717
Just trying to get a sense of the place.

11:59.720 --> 12:02.713
Well, best way to get along,
do as you're told,

12:03.800 --> 12:05.917
try not to bump into the robots.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.279
If you can manage that,
you might end up on a poster.

12:12.600 --> 12:13.795
That's you!

12:14.320 --> 12:16.915
- Film star looks.
- (LAUGHING)

12:17.800 --> 12:19.314
I got extra credit for it.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.710
Sent a poster to my little girl
for her bedroom wall.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.631
- How old is she?
- Six.

12:25.720 --> 12:28.679
- Where is she?
- She's upstairs. Just had her finals.

12:29.840 --> 12:31.274
No, she's back home on Kandoka.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.030
She made me this.

12:33.680 --> 12:37.435
Lacquered with arcadium.
Outlast anything, this will.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.320

12:50.760 --> 12:53.275
Twice a year I splurge
on an economy shuttle.

12:53.360 --> 12:55.795
The rest of our wages
I put away for her education.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.835
I do this job
so she doesn't end up like her dad.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.837
- Her dad's all right.
- Well...

13:03.480 --> 13:07.110
I was a rubbish husband to her mum,
but I'm making up for it.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.073
It's tough being away from family.

13:10.800 --> 13:14.714
Well, at least I'm working.

This was done somewhere else
before it gets to Fulfilment.

21:25.600 --> 21:27.398
Something is very wrong here at Kerblam.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.633
And if you two
don't do something about it,

21:30.720 --> 21:33.599
I might start to suspect
that you're responsible.

you'll have me to answer to.

21:53.360 --> 21:54.635

into his office, obviously.

41:34.160 --> 41:35.355
It wasn't meant for her.

41:36.360 --> 41:39.194
The system took her.
It's been fighting back against me.

41:40.560 --> 41:44.031
Because it knew what you were planning.
The maintenance man!

41:44.400 --> 41:48.189
Access to everywhere,
noticed by hardly anyone.

41:48.280 --> 41:49.873
Have you been killing other workers?

41:50.440 --> 41:52.511
I needed test subjects to be sure

41:52.600 --> 41:55.240
the detonation forces would work
in such a small concentration.

41:55.840 --> 41:58.071
What... What?
Charlie, how do you know all this stuff?

41:58.160 --> 42:00.311
I lied on my application.

42:00.400 --> 42:03.199
Gave you a sob story
so you'd let me in and you bought it.

42:03.280 --> 42:05.749
I've studied cybernetics, explosives,
teleportation.

42:05.840 --> 42:06.840
I have worked for this.

42:06.920 --> 42:08.274
I don't understand it.

42:08.840 --> 42:09.840
Ten percent.

42:11.200 --> 42:14.238
They want us to be grateful
that 10% of people get to work.

42:14.320 --> 42:17.040
What about the other 90%?
What about our futures?

42:17.120 --> 42:21.433
Because without action, next time
it will be 7%, then five, then one.

42:22.200 --> 42:23.953
I am stronger than you.

42:24.400 --> 42:26.073
I am not going to stand by
and accept it.

42:26.640 --> 42:29.838
People like me, my generation,
we change things.

42:29.920 --> 42:30.990
We make things happen.

42:31.080 --> 42:33.037
Even if it costs people's lives?

42:33.600 --> 42:37.833
You kill a load of customers at Kerblam,
let the systems take the fall for it,

42:37.920 --> 42:41.675
erode people's trust in automation,
make people angry.

42:41.760 --> 42:44.036
Imperfect technology
without a conscience.

42:44.120 --> 42:45.760
Machines malfunction,
that's what they do.

42:45.840 --> 42:48.878
No, mate, that's what you're doing.
Seriously malfunctioning.

42:48.960 --> 42:50.155
I'm not your mate.

42:50.240 --> 42:52.994
Except Kerblam's system
does have a conscience.

42:53.080 --> 42:55.311
It's been fighting you, Charlie.
It knew it.

42:55.400 --> 42:59.394
It sent a message across the galaxy
begging for help.

42:59.480 --> 43:03.554
That TeamMate in Slade's office,
it was coming for you.

43:04.880 --> 43:06.155
And then Kira,

43:06.560 --> 43:09.553
it took her,
knowing how you felt about her,

43:09.640 --> 43:11.996
to show you how it would feel.

43:12.560 --> 43:15.439
Because how you feel right now
about Kira

43:15.520 --> 43:20.311
is how all those families and friends
will feel if your plan goes off.

43:20.400 --> 43:21.800
I don't care.

43:21.880 --> 43:24.793
I think you do.
I think you came here with a plan,

43:24.880 --> 43:26.678
but you didn't expect to fall in love.

43:26.760 --> 43:27.955
But that's what happens.

43:29.000 --> 43:32.357
Use it, Charlie. Learn from it, please.

43:33.280 --> 43:35.795
No! No.

43:36.680 --> 43:41.357
If that's the price to change
how everyone on Kandoka sees technology,

43:41.440 --> 43:42.954
then it is worth it for the cause.

43:43.040 --> 43:44.696
This isn't a cause.
You're not an activist.

43:44.720 --> 43:46.040
This is cold-blooded murder.

43:46.120 --> 43:47.839
We can't let the systems take control!

43:47.920 --> 43:49.513
The systems aren't the problem.

43:49.600 --> 43:54.231
How people use and exploit the system,
that's the problem.

Not enough time to fix it.

(SIGHS) Not enough time for that either.

44:27.240 --> 44:28.240
Maybe worth a go.
