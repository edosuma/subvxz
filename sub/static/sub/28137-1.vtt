WEBVTT

00:13.883 --> 00:16.886
[light music]

01:23.779 --> 01:26.651
[Davenport] Recently, uh...

01:26.695 --> 01:29.654
I don't know, I've been taking some time to, uh,

01:30.612 --> 01:32.440
meditate on death

01:33.528 --> 01:35.617
and the remains of

01:36.487 --> 01:39.229
mortal objects.

01:39.273 --> 01:44.495
Skulls, bones, I managed
to spend a day in a morgue.

01:44.539 --> 01:46.106
And I'm not gonna tell you

01:46.149 --> 01:48.717
how I convinced them to let me
linger there, but they did.

01:49.935 --> 01:51.459
And that's another story.

01:52.242 --> 01:53.591
But, uh,

01:53.635 --> 01:56.246
I believe with a creative life

01:56.290 --> 02:00.163
that, uh,
contemplation of mortality

02:00.946 --> 02:03.949
is essential meditation.

02:03.993 --> 02:09.085
Consider the way the feces
from all the animals

02:09.128 --> 02:12.175
and rotting carcasses
of all dead creatures

02:12.219 --> 02:13.916
feeds the planet,

02:15.178 --> 02:17.920
and bring about new life.

02:17.963 --> 02:22.054
So death
is in a fundamental way...

02:23.491 --> 02:24.883
creative.

02:26.233 --> 02:31.151
And to die
is to feed the environment

02:32.064 --> 02:35.198
with a life giving force.

02:37.200 --> 02:40.160
[light music]

03:02.660 --> 03:04.619
[bird chirping]

03:12.279 --> 03:15.325
Let's meditate on the idea

03:15.369 --> 03:16.805
of a building.

03:19.808 --> 03:21.853
Is it bricks and mortar?

03:22.767 --> 03:24.639
Is it steel and glass?

03:25.814 --> 03:28.817
Imagine a day

03:28.860 --> 03:30.775
when the walls
and the structures

03:30.819 --> 03:34.736
that we live in
grow and change organically

03:34.779 --> 03:36.607
around us,

03:36.651 --> 03:40.481
according to carefully
calculated algorithms.

03:42.047 --> 03:43.745
Now, you could stop
at the basement renovation,

03:43.788 --> 03:44.920
you'd still have
the income suite.

03:44.963 --> 03:46.182
But I think the coach house
would have

03:46.226 --> 03:48.532
an enormous long term value
to the property.

03:48.576 --> 03:51.013
I don't know,
but it is a little pricy.

03:52.319 --> 03:55.365
Well, perhaps we can
reduce the surface area

03:55.409 --> 03:56.497
for you guys in here.

03:56.540 --> 03:57.976
-[clatters]
-[Jonathan] Oh!

03:58.020 --> 04:00.675
Doesn't seem very solid either.

04:00.718 --> 04:02.981
Well, uh, that...
that was a model. Uh, the...

04:03.025 --> 04:05.680
the actual final result
would be more durable.

04:05.723 --> 04:07.334
Yeah, you know what, Jonathan,
we actually have to go.

04:07.377 --> 04:08.770
I'm sorry, the sitter's gonna be
at the house

04:08.813 --> 04:10.293
-in 15 minutes.
-Ah, that's right.

04:10.337 --> 04:11.425
We have to go, Glenn.

04:11.468 --> 04:12.991
You've given us a lot
to think about.

04:13.035 --> 04:15.037
-Great.
-Um, we'll touch base next week

04:15.080 --> 04:17.168
-and see where we're at.
-Okay. Yeah, of course.

04:17.213 --> 04:18.649
But, meaning to ask you.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.303
Lear...

04:20.346 --> 04:21.826
Any relationship
with the architect

04:21.870 --> 04:24.612
-Davenport Lear?
-Uh, no. No. No relation.

04:24.655 --> 04:26.570
-Oh, well. Hey.
-Talk to you soon.

04:26.614 --> 04:27.963
-Yeah.
-Okay. Thanks, John.

04:28.659 --> 04:29.660
[door closes]

04:33.447 --> 04:35.013
The future, my friends,

04:35.971 --> 04:38.321
China.

04:38.365 --> 04:41.977
A land with the demands
of population

04:42.020 --> 04:46.155
and a government that benefits from capitalistic greed.

04:46.198 --> 04:49.724
But without the requisite
permission required

04:49.767 --> 04:53.293
by private enterprise
to make radical, bold

04:53.336 --> 04:55.860
and sometimes
unpopular decisions.

04:55.904 --> 04:58.733
I... I know you don't have
the same restrictions in China,

04:58.776 --> 05:01.039
but I assure you,
you do not want

05:01.083 --> 05:04.869
uh, Davenport to leverage
his draconian opinions

05:04.913 --> 05:07.350
on your, uh... on your project.

05:09.047 --> 05:10.745
Yeah.

05:10.788 --> 05:12.486
Yeah. Well, we're sort of, uh,
[stammers]

05:12.529 --> 05:14.749
an autonomous franchise.

05:14.792 --> 05:16.316
No, no, no, no.
[chuckles]

05:16.359 --> 05:19.362
Wait. Yeah, yeah. You'll have
the exact same design team

05:19.406 --> 05:22.104
you would as if you're working
under Davenport.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.367
Yeah.

05:24.411 --> 05:25.847
Yeah. A little bit of magic.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.109
[laughs]

05:27.152 --> 05:29.024
No, sir. Yeah, I understand.
Okay. Well...

05:29.067 --> 05:30.199
[speaks in Chinese]

05:32.723 --> 05:33.724
Not bad.

05:36.379 --> 05:38.120
Little early for that kind
of volume isn't?

05:38.163 --> 05:39.687
[babies crying]

05:41.079 --> 05:42.254
Oh, the twins are up.

05:43.517 --> 05:44.996
Yeah. I got it.

05:47.738 --> 05:49.610
[phone rings]

05:50.611 --> 05:52.352
[Tom] Hello? Yeah.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.356
[babies crying]

06:00.708 --> 06:02.840
[cell phone ringing]

06:03.798 --> 06:05.321
Yeah. Hello, who's this?

06:05.365 --> 06:07.323
Is this Glenn Lear I have
the pleasure of speaking with?

06:07.367 --> 06:09.064
Yeah, this is Glenn Lear.
Who's this?

06:09.107 --> 06:12.633
My name is Tyler, I work
for your father, Davenport Lear.

06:12.676 --> 06:15.244
He asked me
to make contact with you.

06:15.287 --> 06:17.072
What for? I... I haven't...

06:17.115 --> 06:18.421
I haven't spoken to him
in years.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.467
Your father specifically
requested

06:20.510 --> 06:22.425
I contact all of his children.

06:22.469 --> 06:24.514
He wants you in LA this weekend.

06:24.558 --> 06:27.038
Tyler, it'd be nice get
a little bit more, uh, warning

06:27.082 --> 06:29.476
when I'm being summoned
by the great man, you know.

06:29.519 --> 06:33.001
I'm sorry. I called as soon
as he asked me too.

06:33.044 --> 06:36.526
Let's not leave out
the enormous egos involved

06:36.570 --> 06:39.616
in this great creative act.

06:39.660 --> 06:42.663
[Davenport]Would it not inflate
any man's head

06:42.706 --> 06:47.276
to know that he is shaping
the very landscape

06:47.319 --> 06:49.887
on which humanity treads?

06:49.931 --> 06:53.195
Not even the best among us
is entirely immune

06:53.238 --> 06:54.414
to this hubris.

06:57.939 --> 07:00.463
Tyler, the day that I need
someone to pay for my flights

07:00.507 --> 07:02.117
is the day I put a gun
to my head.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.075
So, no. You tell dad
to keep his money,

07:04.119 --> 07:06.121
I don't need it.
And I will see you tomorrow.

07:06.164 --> 07:07.339
Okay, bye.

07:07.383 --> 07:08.863
Ridiculous.
[chuckles]

07:08.906 --> 07:10.212
Okay, so we need your signature.

07:10.255 --> 07:11.431
-Yeah.
-[Amelia] There, there.

07:11.474 --> 07:13.041
Okay, and I need my, uh...

07:13.084 --> 07:14.825
-My ticket's on my phone please.
-Here is your paper ticket.

07:14.869 --> 07:16.348
Okay. But on my phone.

07:16.392 --> 07:17.872
You just put your thumb here.

07:17.915 --> 07:19.439
-It'll show up when you...
-Okay, great.

07:19.482 --> 07:20.701
-Is the car ready?
-Car's ready.

07:20.744 --> 07:22.137
-Okay, let's go.
-And your bag's in your car.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.617
-Okay, please stop talking.
-And you're car's warm

07:23.660 --> 07:25.183
-Let's get the car and let's go.
-There's just one more

07:25.227 --> 07:26.228
thing we need.

07:26.271 --> 07:27.098
-Phil's waiting outside.
-[groans]

07:27.142 --> 07:28.491
He's been waiting for two hours,

07:28.535 --> 07:29.840
-Just give him five minutes.
-Okay, send him in.

07:29.884 --> 07:30.972
-Just five minutes.
-Send him in.

07:31.015 --> 07:31.929
Send him in.

07:34.541 --> 07:36.760
Wonderful, so, uh, Mr. Lear
just has a few minutes

07:36.804 --> 07:38.458
-before he catches him flight.
-[Kent] Hello, Phil.

07:38.501 --> 07:40.590
-Hey, Kent. How are you?
-I'm good.

07:40.634 --> 07:41.983
You're fired.

07:42.026 --> 07:43.724
-[Phil] What?
-You're fired.

07:43.767 --> 07:44.942
What do you mean I'm fired?

07:44.986 --> 07:46.466
This deal that just blew up
in your face

07:46.509 --> 07:48.206
cost me a lot of money. Okay?

07:48.250 --> 07:50.513
I don't like losing money
so you're fired.

07:50.557 --> 07:51.949
You've never had a bad deal?

07:51.993 --> 07:54.299
[Kent] No, Phil.
I've never had a bad deal.

07:54.343 --> 07:55.736
If I could just say,
he has a wife

07:55.779 --> 07:57.172
-and three kids...
-Amelia, get a security...

07:57.215 --> 07:58.782
-His wife just...
-Stop talking.

07:58.826 --> 08:00.218
Take his security pass.
Get his ass

08:00.262 --> 08:01.959
-out of the building. Right now.
-I'm on to it, sir.

08:02.003 --> 08:03.091
I'm so sorry, Phil. Um...

08:03.134 --> 08:04.396
[Kent] Please, stop...
stop talking.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.398
-One-thirty.
-[Kent] Stop talking.

08:07.574 --> 08:08.575
Sorry...

08:12.840 --> 08:15.103
I think he is retiring.

08:15.146 --> 08:16.670
I think he's gathering us
all together

08:16.713 --> 08:18.846
so he could tell us how he's
gonna divide up the company.

08:22.153 --> 08:23.503
You know, Rory's coming.

08:26.636 --> 08:28.856
-Rory's coming?
-Yup.

08:28.899 --> 08:30.161
I mean, that's
what they told me.

08:30.684 --> 08:31.685
Huh.

08:32.554 --> 08:34.078
Uh, where is he?

08:34.688 --> 08:37.691
[light music]

08:52.140 --> 08:53.924
[waves crashing]

08:58.233 --> 09:00.452
You're one tough son of a bitch
to find, you know that?

09:04.108 --> 09:07.198
This is your weekend.
I have plans.

09:07.242 --> 09:09.418
Okay, uh, I know. I'm sorry.

09:09.461 --> 09:12.726
It's important to me.
It's about my dad.

09:12.769 --> 09:14.205
-[Sally] Davenport?
-Yes.

09:14.249 --> 09:16.599
He wants me to come to LA. Okay?

09:16.643 --> 09:18.775
And I think he's gonna announce
his retirement,

09:18.819 --> 09:20.734
and he's flying me down there
first class, Sal.

09:20.777 --> 09:22.344
And I think... I think
this is finally it.

09:22.387 --> 09:24.259
I think he's finally decided
that I'm the one.

09:24.868 --> 09:26.043
[scoffs]

09:26.087 --> 09:27.262
The one?

09:27.305 --> 09:29.525
The one to take over
the company.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.049
What? He practically
abandoned you.

09:41.189 --> 09:42.886
[Diana] Hi there, you two.

09:42.930 --> 09:44.322
-Hi, Diana. Is, uh,
-[Diana] Hi.

09:44.366 --> 09:45.628
-is Rory here?
-Uh, no.

09:45.672 --> 09:46.977
-But, uh, Kent's inside.
-Okay.

09:51.329 --> 09:52.374
Hey.

09:54.115 --> 09:56.117
-Hey.
-Hey, please, let me get those.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.422
-You've had a long trip. Please.
-Yeah?

09:57.466 --> 09:58.728
-You sure? All right. Here.
-Oh, yes.

09:58.772 --> 09:59.860
Got it, I've got it.

09:59.903 --> 10:01.383
-Yeah.
-I got it, I got it.

10:01.426 --> 10:02.602
-Yeah. Okay. All right.
-I've got the... Yeah.

10:02.645 --> 10:04.255
-Yeah?
-[Diana grunts]

10:05.343 --> 10:06.562
[Tom] No, on Tuesday.

10:08.825 --> 10:10.131
Uh-huh.

10:14.352 --> 10:16.354
All right. All right,
I'll see him then.

10:17.181 --> 10:18.226
[grunts]

10:25.755 --> 10:26.843
[approaching footsteps]

10:28.802 --> 10:30.194
[Diana] Excuse me, Kent.

10:31.326 --> 10:34.242
Regan, Tom, how are you guys?

10:34.285 --> 10:36.244
Good to see you as always, Kent.

10:36.287 --> 10:37.811
How ya doin'?
How are things on your end?

10:37.854 --> 10:40.378
Well, constantly busy, you know,
making money hand over fist.

10:40.422 --> 10:42.511
-[Tom chuckles]
-How's the architecture game?

10:42.554 --> 10:43.991
Pretty good, pretty good.

10:44.034 --> 10:45.340
Davenport keeps us hopping.

10:45.383 --> 10:46.994
-[Kent] I'll bet he does.
-[chuckles]

10:48.299 --> 10:49.300
Regan.

10:50.301 --> 10:51.563
How are the twins?

10:53.914 --> 10:56.003
Happily with the nanny so we can
get some sleep this weekend.

10:56.046 --> 10:57.657
[Kent] Oh, I doubt we'll be
doing much of that.

10:59.267 --> 11:00.311
Really, Kent?

11:02.531 --> 11:03.706
[sighs]

11:05.447 --> 11:07.710
Oh, she's still a bit
of a bitch, eh, Tom?

11:07.754 --> 11:08.798
[sighs]
Don't mind her.

11:08.842 --> 11:10.408
She's just a bit sleep deprived.

11:12.149 --> 11:13.455
Oh, thanks.

11:13.498 --> 11:15.370
Diana, when Davenport
gets here I'd, uh,

11:16.197 --> 11:17.720
have Delia go home.

11:17.764 --> 11:18.939
It's a work weekend.

11:22.116 --> 11:23.160
Kent?

11:26.773 --> 11:30.951
Architecture is returning
to something more primal.

11:31.995 --> 11:34.128
More nomadic.

11:34.171 --> 11:37.740
Like the landscape
in which we lived.

11:37.784 --> 11:40.700
But truthfully, is architecture
really a field

11:40.743 --> 11:47.924
that aims to service
basic pragmatic human needs?

11:47.968 --> 11:50.535
[Davenport] Or is it
something else?

11:50.579 --> 11:56.759
Is it something more kin
to a religious calling,

11:56.803 --> 12:00.545
where temples are erected
to pay tribute

12:01.459 --> 12:04.288
to the great rulers of the day?

12:04.332 --> 12:07.335
[melancholy music]

12:18.302 --> 12:20.391
[Tom] You must be Glenn?
I'm Tom, Regan's husband.

12:20.435 --> 12:21.697
Heard a lot of good things
about you.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.003
-Tom.
-[door closes]

12:23.046 --> 12:24.047
Nice to meet you.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.094
Is, uh, dad here yet or...

12:27.137 --> 12:28.486
No, no. No, please.

12:29.270 --> 12:30.532
Thanks.

12:30.575 --> 12:31.968
Can I get you
something to drink, uh, glass

12:32.012 --> 12:33.883
-of water or something?
-No, I'm good. Good, thanks.

12:36.277 --> 12:38.322
Wow.

12:38.366 --> 12:40.716
It's nice to see Davenport
can afford such a, uh,

12:40.760 --> 12:42.805
beautiful retreat.

12:42.849 --> 12:45.939
[Tom] Well, by Lear standards
it's actually quite modest.

12:45.982 --> 12:47.505
Right. Modest.

12:48.811 --> 12:50.508
Is this Davenport's idea
of modest?

12:53.337 --> 12:55.731
Why do you think
he would bring us all here?

12:55.775 --> 12:59.561
Well, he wants to divide up
the kingdom, of course.

13:01.911 --> 13:04.609
Shoulda known Kent would
get the jump on all of us.

13:04.653 --> 13:06.002
Fuck you, Glenn.

13:06.046 --> 13:07.525
Oh! Welcome to LA.

13:07.569 --> 13:09.658
[Tom] How about we don't
start the weekend like this?

13:09.701 --> 13:10.702
No, it's okay, Tom.

13:11.965 --> 13:14.228
Kent's always been
a bit of a bastard.

13:14.271 --> 13:15.795
I'm not just speaking
metaphorically here,

13:15.838 --> 13:16.796
all right, Kent?

13:18.319 --> 13:20.147
Glenn, I don't know
if you know Diana,

13:20.190 --> 13:21.888
she's Davenports
personal assistant.

13:21.931 --> 13:23.367
[Glenn] Oh, of course,
I know Diana.

13:23.411 --> 13:24.629
How are you, dear?

13:24.673 --> 13:26.240
Grand. Grand, thank you.

13:26.283 --> 13:29.025
Uh, busy. You know your father.
Keep me running around.

13:29.591 --> 13:30.853
[chuckles]

13:30.897 --> 13:32.637
He hasn't slowed down
even in his age, huh?

13:32.681 --> 13:33.943
No.
[laughs]

13:33.987 --> 13:36.467
But I hear you have, um,
a firm in Toronto now,

13:36.511 --> 13:38.469
and a design
at the Biennale last year?

13:38.513 --> 13:39.557
-[Glenn] I did. Yeah.
-Wow.

13:39.601 --> 13:40.820
That's great.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.430
Thanks. Yeah,
it's prestigious, you know.

13:42.473 --> 13:44.345
Doesn't get me too many clients
but I do all right.

13:44.388 --> 13:45.912
[Tom] What kind of projects
you working on?

13:45.955 --> 13:47.391
uh, mostly residential stuff.

13:47.435 --> 13:50.786
Oh. Translation,
kitchen and bathroom renos.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.614
So, condos. That's fantastic.

13:52.657 --> 13:54.616
I... I hear the, uh,
market is booming up there.

13:54.659 --> 13:56.748
Oh, not for old Glenn here.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.968
There is no way that
he would be standing in a house

13:59.012 --> 14:01.188
of Davenport's
if it wasn't the promise

14:01.231 --> 14:03.016
of a big chunk of cash.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.105
Am I right, big brother?

14:05.148 --> 14:08.499
-[Glenn] Fuck you, Kent.
-Oh, no. Fuck you, Glenn.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.893
Ah! Diana,
I have to pop out for a bit

14:10.937 --> 14:12.547
so I will see you at dinner.

14:12.590 --> 14:14.462
But please, set an extra place,
because I am bringing a friend.

14:14.505 --> 14:16.203
No, Kent. It's a family dinner
this evening.

Oh, fuck!

Jonathan, Glenn Lear.

15:05.165 --> 15:06.470
Yeah, listen. I thought
I'd call you.

15:06.514 --> 15:09.299
I... You know, I realized
the, uh, the plywood

15:09.343 --> 15:12.085
geometric thing might have been
a stretch, and I could, uh...

15:12.128 --> 15:13.390
Yeah. I could tell...
I got the feeling

15:13.434 --> 15:15.740
your wife didn't really like it.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.960
Could you just give it
till Monday?

15:18.004 --> 15:19.831
That's... Yeah, 'cause we put
a lot of work into it.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.224
[stammers]
I really appreciate it, John.

15:22.095 --> 15:24.140
Okay. Thanks.

-You look good.

-Yeah, everybody's

-[Diana] Hey, Rory.

16:20.544 --> 16:22.024
Any trouble finding the place?

16:22.068 --> 16:24.244
[Rory] No, no. I've been here
loads of times.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.681
Really? I thought Davenport
liked to keep this place empty.

16:26.724 --> 16:29.075
Uh, no. He, uh, he lets me stay
here when I'm in town.

16:29.118 --> 16:31.338
It's my little LA pad

-Uh, can we wait

16:38.823 --> 16:40.869
until he's settled 'cause, uh,
dinner's in half an hour. Okay?

downstairs with us?

til tomorrow.

[Glenn] Tomorrow?

18:29.195 --> 18:31.197
That's not what he told us.
I thought he'd be here today.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.763
Well, he's a very busy man.

18:32.807 --> 18:34.374
Oh.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.289
I guess the rest of us have
nothing but time on our hands.

18:36.332 --> 18:37.855
[Diana] That's not
what I meant, Glenn.

18:40.206 --> 18:43.078
Well, I mean he made a point
of flying us all in

18:43.122 --> 18:44.427
so I was just wondering

18:44.471 --> 18:46.081
Well, maybe he just wanted
you all to reconnect

18:46.125 --> 18:47.691
before he got here, you know.

18:47.735 --> 18:49.563

Um, actually, you know,
you could do something for me.

Um, my daughter, Delia,
she's gonna stay for dinner so,

18:55.134 --> 18:57.310

been a Daniel

or a Race or something sexy.

19:22.944 --> 19:24.859

your dad's age.

an asshole.

to come inside

So, Glenn with two N's,
tell me about yourself.

21:54.835 --> 21:56.924
How is it you ended
up in Toronto,

21:56.967 --> 21:59.666

strange older brother?

21:59.709 --> 22:02.712
Uh, personally I'd love to hear
about South America.

22:02.756 --> 22:03.800
Yeah.

22:03.844 --> 22:04.888
Are you avoiding

22:04.932 --> 22:06.325
-the hard questions, Glenn?
-No, no.

22:06.368 --> 22:08.109
-Come on, now. That's no fun.
-[chuckles]

22:08.152 --> 22:10.241
Delia, mind yourself
there, please.

22:10.285 --> 22:12.200
[Delia] Yes, Mother.

22:12.243 --> 22:14.202
No, no. It's fine, Delia.
Actually, I live in Toronto

22:14.245 --> 22:16.683
because that's where Davenport
first met my mother.

22:16.726 --> 22:19.947
Uh, she's the first wife who's
name no one can seem to remember

22:19.990 --> 22:22.079
but it's actually Helen.

22:22.123 --> 22:24.343
-Where's Helen now?
-She lives in Toronto.

22:24.386 --> 22:26.214
And, uh, I go and see her
from time to time

22:26.257 --> 22:29.652
and she suffers from dementia,
she's about 80. Yeah.

22:29.696 --> 22:31.045
[Delia] That's depressing.

22:31.088 --> 22:33.613
But if Davenport Lear
was gonna make things work

22:33.656 --> 22:35.528
he was gonna have
to do two things.

22:35.571 --> 22:37.138
He was gonna have
to change locations

22:37.181 --> 22:39.358
and he was gonna have
to upgrade his wife.

22:39.401 --> 22:42.099
So, he dumped
the old model, my mom

22:42.143 --> 22:43.710
and he took up with Kent's mom.

22:43.753 --> 22:45.320
A very charming woman

22:45.364 --> 22:47.453
and thinks to seem to go
swimmingly for a while.

22:48.628 --> 22:50.151
But then, you know,
he got a little bored,

22:50.194 --> 22:52.283
he started shopping the aisles
until he picked up

22:52.327 --> 22:56.636
with Rosalyn, who is the, uh,
beautiful, very affluent

22:56.679 --> 22:59.508
and, uh, lovely mother
to Rory and Regan.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.423
And, uh...

23:02.468 --> 23:04.034
Sadly she got sick.

23:04.078 --> 23:06.254
And she had cancer
and she passed on.

23:07.255 --> 23:08.865
Um...

23:08.909 --> 23:10.867
So, I... I don't know.
I just somehow feel

23:10.911 --> 23:12.782
like this is a setup

23:12.826 --> 23:15.611
for the next
cancer announcements.

23:15.655 --> 23:17.700
Davenport was never happy
with Helen.

23:19.310 --> 23:20.703
He spent most weekends
at our place

23:20.747 --> 23:22.575
even while he was
still married to her.

23:22.618 --> 23:24.141
You know, but she...

23:24.185 --> 23:26.927
She badgered him
and she pushed him out.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.319
If she hadn't been
such a bitch to him,

23:28.363 --> 23:29.582
he may never have left Toronto.

23:31.018 --> 23:33.020
But she made sure he got
as far away as possible

23:33.063 --> 23:35.326
and so after he left there was
no reason for us to stay.

23:37.198 --> 23:38.721
In a way, you know,
[chuckles]

23:38.765 --> 23:42.029
I think he did us a favor.

23:42.072 --> 23:44.379
And I have his breakup
with your mom to thank

23:44.423 --> 23:45.859
for me getting my start
in New York.

23:45.902 --> 23:48.122
So I say, "Thank God
for that." Hmm?

23:48.165 --> 23:49.515
I'm really glad
my poor old mother

23:49.558 --> 23:51.473
could help service
your fucking life in some way.

23:51.517 --> 23:54.041
Hey, get off your
righteous martyr horse, Glenn.

23:54.084 --> 23:55.434
You're way too old for this

23:55.477 --> 23:56.609
-self-pity bullshit.
-[Regan] Okay, it's no one's

23:56.652 --> 23:58.828
fault that he left your mother.

23:58.872 --> 24:01.265
Some mirages
just can't work. Okay?

24:02.832 --> 24:05.269
There's no passion,
it's as simple as that.

24:09.839 --> 24:12.712
[Glenn] Sometimes things
just don't work out.

24:12.755 --> 24:16.063
We're all here in the spirit
of openness, right?

24:16.106 --> 24:18.326
All of us here are grown-ups,
some more than others.

24:20.415 --> 24:22.243
I think it's time
that you guys know

24:22.286 --> 24:23.592
what it was like
being the eldest

24:23.636 --> 24:25.289
-in this fucked up family.
-[Regan] Uh, okay.

24:25.333 --> 24:28.815
Yes, we're all officially dying
to hear about it, Glenn.

24:28.858 --> 24:31.905
At first it was just Davenport,
me and Helen.

24:34.168 --> 24:36.953
Davenport always worked a lot,
but he was home, you know.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.088
And he would help me
with my homework and shit,

24:41.131 --> 24:42.568
but I used to study piano
as a kid

24:42.611 --> 24:45.005
and I fucking hated the piano,

24:45.048 --> 24:48.965
but I was too scared
to give it up, you know.

24:49.009 --> 24:51.968
Because it was the only time
that I had him all to myself.

24:52.012 --> 24:54.362
You know? And he was mine.

24:54.405 --> 24:56.756
You know, I just... I don't know
what I did to Davenport,

24:56.799 --> 24:59.280
you know, to make him stop
wanting me when I was a kid.

24:59.323 --> 25:01.804
Glenn, he never stopped
loving you.

25:04.415 --> 25:05.895
Diana, what would you know
about that?

25:08.419 --> 25:10.291
You know, I never had
much time with...

25:11.292 --> 25:13.816
Davenport as a child either.

25:13.860 --> 25:15.339
But when he disappeared
from my life,

25:15.383 --> 25:16.950
you know what I did?
I sought him out

25:16.993 --> 25:19.822
and I confronted him like a man.

25:19.866 --> 25:21.737
And we have a pretty good
relationship today.

25:22.608 --> 25:23.696
[Glenn] Lucky you.

25:25.349 --> 25:26.960
You never call him,
you never visit.

25:27.003 --> 25:30.137
I actually come to LA
quite a lot.

25:30.180 --> 25:32.748
And I never make a trip here
without announcing it to him.

25:32.792 --> 25:35.272
Well, he just...
He's just always busy.

25:35.316 --> 25:37.100
You know, he's just never
really seemed to have the time.

25:38.754 --> 25:40.364
Well, we're all gathered.

25:41.670 --> 25:43.411
The great man has called us.

25:44.934 --> 25:47.720
We don't know why.
We don't know where he is.

25:47.763 --> 25:49.548
[laughing]

25:51.462 --> 25:55.118
Now that's classic
Davenport. Huh?

25:55.162 --> 25:57.164
I'd love to hear
about South America, Rory.

25:57.207 --> 25:58.600
-[Glenn] Yeah, Ror.
-Yeah.

25:58.644 --> 26:00.471
Regale us with the tails of your

26:00.515 --> 26:02.909
youthful-carefree travels.
Carry away.

26:02.952 --> 26:04.563
Well, there's not much
to say really.

26:04.606 --> 26:07.914
I mean, I spent the last year
in my motorcycle traveling

26:07.957 --> 26:09.002
through South America.

26:11.091 --> 26:12.571
Cool. What for?

26:14.398 --> 26:15.704
I don't know.
I just felt the need

26:15.748 --> 26:17.010
to get away from everything.

26:18.098 --> 26:19.360
Didn't you ever feel like that?

26:21.057 --> 26:23.103
Sure. Sure, I know.
Of course I did.

26:23.146 --> 26:24.321
I just... I got a job

26:24.365 --> 26:26.106
and I got a kid
I gotta support, you know.

26:28.021 --> 26:29.500
On that treadmill,
you know what I mean?

26:29.544 --> 26:31.546
I can't bear any more
of this self-pity.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.243
I need a smoke.
Come on, Natalie, let's go.

26:33.287 --> 26:35.115
You can be
such an asshole, Kent.

26:35.158 --> 26:37.770
Say that word again. I love it
when you say it like that.

26:37.813 --> 26:38.858
[Glenn] We're finally
gathered here,

26:38.901 --> 26:40.163
we're doing a little
family sharing

26:40.207 --> 26:41.556
and you brought
exotic dancer here,

26:41.600 --> 26:43.340
now you both need
to fucking smoke.

26:43.384 --> 26:44.428
Great!

26:44.472 --> 26:45.821
I'm an actress.

26:45.865 --> 26:47.170
I'm sure you are, gorgeous.

26:47.214 --> 26:48.824
You know what,
I should punch you in the face.

26:48.868 --> 26:49.912
[Glenn] Well, fucking bring it.

26:49.956 --> 26:51.261
Yeah, I'm gonna bring it, buddy.

26:51.305 --> 26:52.611
[Tom] Gentlemen!

26:52.654 --> 26:54.134
Glenn, I don't know you
very well

26:54.177 --> 26:55.788
and you've obviously got
some issues.

26:55.831 --> 26:57.877
But that is
way too much hostility.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.661
Guess what, Tom, I don't know
you very well either.

26:59.705 --> 27:01.358
Maybe mind
your fucking business, okay?

27:01.402 --> 27:03.056
This family is my business.

27:03.099 --> 27:04.274
Oh, is it really your business?

27:04.318 --> 27:05.928
Is that why you married
my sister, Regan?

27:05.972 --> 27:07.626
Who's by the way,
way too fucking hot

27:07.669 --> 27:08.975
and young for you, okay?

27:10.019 --> 27:11.455
For a little piece?

27:11.499 --> 27:13.632
A little piece
of the family business there?

27:13.675 --> 27:15.546
Of course that's why
he married her.

27:15.590 --> 27:16.983
Kent, you're gonna turn
on me now too?

27:17.026 --> 27:18.506
-What's the matter with you?
-[Kent] Come on, Tom.

27:18.549 --> 27:19.594
There's nothing
to be ashamed of.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.422
It was a political marriage,
so what?

27:21.465 --> 27:23.511
We have a beautiful
and healthy marriage.

27:23.554 --> 27:26.035
[cackles]
Come on, let's get some wine.

27:26.079 --> 27:27.384
[Glenn laughs]

27:27.428 --> 27:30.387
You think Davenport Lear's
gonna come in here

27:30.431 --> 27:32.172
and tell us that
he's dying of cancer,

27:32.215 --> 27:34.696
and that he's finally decided
to choose a successor?

27:34.740 --> 27:36.437
And it's gonna be none other
than that's right,

27:36.480 --> 27:37.917
half-weighted,
middle-aged mediocrity

27:37.960 --> 27:39.658
Tom Cornwall here.

27:39.701 --> 27:41.094
You're the man
for the job, Tommy.

27:41.137 --> 27:42.965
-He's not dying.
-[Glenn] Oh, he's... What?

27:43.009 --> 27:44.532
Then why would he
bring us all together?

27:46.186 --> 27:47.448
[Regan] I think Glenn's right.

27:48.536 --> 27:50.016
I think he's dying.

27:50.059 --> 27:51.278
I mean, maybe not right now,

27:51.321 --> 27:54.629
but I... I think this is...
this is weird.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.326
Gathering us like this.
I mean, I haven't seen Glenn

27:56.370 --> 27:58.154
-since our mother's funeral.
-[Glenn] Exactly.

27:59.503 --> 28:01.070
Because we know the truth.

28:01.114 --> 28:02.768
the truth is that Davenport
doesn't call his favorite son

28:02.811 --> 28:05.335
because he has some desire
to have a family get together.

28:05.379 --> 28:06.685
Right? I mean, usually, Delia,

28:06.728 --> 28:08.338
I'm the one who's invited
to the sober events.

28:08.382 --> 28:09.862
Shut the fuck up!

28:12.516 --> 28:14.214
Which reminds me, Diana,

28:14.257 --> 28:16.477
do you think you could get us
some more of this, uh...

28:16.520 --> 28:18.174
Would you get it yourself?

28:18.218 --> 28:19.741
My mom's not the help.

28:19.785 --> 28:22.701
Oh, sweetheart, I... I have
to tell you she actually is.

28:22.744 --> 28:24.441
[Delia] No, she isn't.

28:26.661 --> 28:28.402
Would you tell them?

28:28.445 --> 28:29.577
[Tom] Tell them what?

28:31.274 --> 28:33.146
Tell them why
they're really here.

28:33.189 --> 28:35.626
Diana, why are we really here?

28:38.020 --> 28:41.154
Davenport invited you all here
this weekend

28:41.197 --> 28:44.723
for a very specific reason.

28:44.766 --> 28:47.726
This Sunday
he's marrying my mom.

28:47.769 --> 28:48.988
That's what's happening.

28:49.031 --> 28:50.598
[Diana] Delia, you shouldn't
have said that.

28:50.990 --> 28:52.600
Why not?

28:52.643 --> 28:55.559
'Cause I can't stand watching
them treat you like dad's maid.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.301
Dad?

28:58.345 --> 29:00.347
He's gonna be my father too.

29:00.390 --> 29:01.652
So just get used to it.

29:06.222 --> 29:09.008
That's fucking
perfectly ridiculous.

29:09.051 --> 29:10.531
[Kent chuckles]
I agree with Glenn.

29:10.574 --> 29:13.969
I mean, enough is enough,
the guy's like 80 years old.

29:14.013 --> 29:16.406
It's not ridiculous,
it's just a fact.

29:16.450 --> 29:18.713
-[scoffs]
-And he's only 75.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.106
-Oh, wow.
-Delia, be a pet

29:20.149 --> 29:21.890
and go get a sweater for me
from my room please.

29:26.199 --> 29:28.114
[retreating footsteps]

29:33.336 --> 29:35.774
Davenport is Delia's father.

29:35.817 --> 29:37.210
Well, he will be
after the wedding,

29:37.253 --> 29:38.951
-I guess.
-No. I mean he is

29:38.994 --> 29:40.300
her actual father.

29:42.128 --> 29:44.695
It happened 18 years ago.
I'm not enormously proud of it,

29:44.739 --> 29:46.959
-but it happened.
-What?

29:49.178 --> 29:50.789
Delia doesn't know.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.486
Okay? And Davenport is trying
to deal with the right things.

29:52.529 --> 29:55.837
So I would appreciate it if you
would all keep that quiet.

29:55.881 --> 29:58.361
Davenport and I want to be able
to tell her ourselves.

29:59.362 --> 30:00.581
Jesus Christ.

30:00.624 --> 30:02.452
[Diana] Oh, it's just...
It's time to just

30:02.496 --> 30:03.889
get it all out
in the open, you know?

30:03.932 --> 30:05.760
Enough secrets in this family.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.154
Wait, you had a child with dad?

30:11.026 --> 30:12.071
[Tom] Diana...

30:13.768 --> 30:15.248
Really?

30:15.291 --> 30:17.163
I didn't want you to find out
like this, I'm sorry.

30:17.206 --> 30:18.512
And Davenport had
wanted to tell you

30:18.555 --> 30:19.687
after he arrived, but...

30:21.297 --> 30:22.429
This Sunday...

30:23.734 --> 30:26.172
at this house...

30:26.215 --> 30:29.653
there will be a wedding
and that is why you're all here.

30:29.697 --> 30:32.047
Go to bed, young lady. Go, hmm.

30:32.091 --> 30:34.397
[retreating footsteps]

30:37.574 --> 30:38.619
[Kent grunts]

30:48.759 --> 30:50.109
-Hey.
-Hey.

30:52.024 --> 30:53.852
-It's okay.
-[sighs]

30:53.895 --> 30:56.071
-They'll come around, Mom.
-[scoffs]

31:00.423 --> 31:02.208
I don't even know why
you guys bothered

31:02.251 --> 31:03.949
to invite them all anyway.

31:05.211 --> 31:07.213
They all just think
it's a big payout.

31:11.260 --> 31:13.393
Oh, my love.

31:13.436 --> 31:15.221
You don't understand a thing.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.008
Love you.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.839
[Regan] Rory,
what are you doing?

31:24.883 --> 31:26.188
-What are you doing?
-I'm... I'm...

31:26.232 --> 31:28.408
-I'm leaving.
-No, you're not. No, no, no.

31:28.451 --> 31:29.757
You can't...
you can't leave me, Rory.

31:29.800 --> 31:31.106
Do not do this to me.

31:31.150 --> 31:32.455
What's the point of all this?

31:34.588 --> 31:36.068
Who cares
if dad's marrying Diana?

31:36.111 --> 31:37.721
-It doesn't matter.
-[stammers]

31:37.765 --> 31:40.855
I don't care but I mean
he's not even here.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.771
I'm sick of being manipulated
all the time.

31:43.814 --> 31:45.816
Last time when you left me I...

31:45.860 --> 31:47.731
I couldn't breathe,
I couldn't stand it.

31:47.775 --> 31:49.081
I... I don't... I don't know.

31:49.124 --> 31:50.604
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

31:52.693 --> 31:56.262
Having you here is like
the sun is shining again.

31:56.305 --> 31:57.350
Stop it.

31:59.743 --> 32:02.659
I'm not happy
when you're not around.

32:02.703 --> 32:06.054
It's not healthy for us
to be around each other.

32:07.360 --> 32:08.578
Why do think I'm in a hiding?

32:08.622 --> 32:11.407
[stammers]
You know, why did you come here?

32:11.451 --> 32:13.540
Because Tommy said
this was important.

32:15.324 --> 32:16.891
I thought Davenport was dying.

32:19.154 --> 32:20.982
-Huh?
-[Diana] What about me?

32:21.026 --> 32:22.679
What about you?

32:22.723 --> 32:23.811
[keys jingle]

32:25.030 --> 32:26.683
[Diana] Don't I mean
anything to you?

32:30.339 --> 32:31.384
[Glenn] Of course.

32:32.515 --> 32:33.821
We were young.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.433
That was a long time ago.
[chuckle]

32:41.220 --> 32:43.396
I mean, I don't really think
about it that much

32:43.439 --> 32:44.658
to be honest with you.

32:45.746 --> 32:46.834
I do.

32:47.704 --> 32:49.054
Every single day.

32:51.665 --> 32:52.753
Well, as it turns out

32:52.796 --> 32:54.624
I'm gonna need
a little bit more time.

32:54.668 --> 32:55.886
Yeah, I know we said the weekend

32:55.930 --> 32:58.280
but it's the family,
you don't wanna push.

32:58.324 --> 33:00.239
No, he's not here yet.

33:00.282 --> 33:02.241
Yes, Mr. Chairman, I understand.

33:02.284 --> 33:03.329
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

33:03.372 --> 33:04.678
[speaks Chinese]

33:04.721 --> 33:05.940
Whoa, you're not thinking
of leaving are you?

33:05.984 --> 33:07.159
Well, you can't...
you can't leave.

33:08.899 --> 33:11.119
-Really?
-Yeah.

33:11.163 --> 33:13.295
You know, see
what he's got going on.

33:13.339 --> 33:14.688
Yeah, I see
what he's got going on.

33:14.731 --> 33:16.472
Clearly, he knocked
this woman up 18 years ago

33:16.516 --> 33:17.865
and the company's gonna be hers.

33:17.908 --> 33:19.475
Not the first guy to have
his judgement skewered

33:19.519 --> 33:21.390
by a nice pair of tits
but probably not the last.

33:21.434 --> 33:22.913
Oh, he definitely won't
be the last.

33:22.957 --> 33:24.350
[Glenn] Where the fuck
did you come from?

33:24.393 --> 33:25.786
I think if you leave now,

33:25.829 --> 33:28.267
you're gonna blow
your chances with Davenport.

33:28.310 --> 33:29.877
What chances
are you talking about?

33:29.920 --> 33:31.748
The guy doesn't give a shit.
He doesn't care about his kids,

33:31.792 --> 33:33.402
he never has.

33:33.446 --> 33:35.448
I mean, it's like I'm denying
to any connections to this guy,

33:35.491 --> 33:36.666
it's fucking embarrassing.

33:36.710 --> 33:38.016
And then he thinks
I'm gonna give a shit

33:38.059 --> 33:39.408
-about his third marriage?
-[Kent] It's a test.

33:39.452 --> 33:41.062
Don't you guys see that?

33:41.106 --> 33:42.716
[Tom] What?

33:42.759 --> 33:44.979
Well, maybe you don't see it.
Maybe I'm the only one the does

33:45.023 --> 33:46.502
'cause I don't give a shit
about his money

33:46.546 --> 33:47.851
or his precious firm,
but don't you think

33:47.895 --> 33:49.244
it's some kinda test?

33:49.288 --> 33:51.203
Go on, genius. What do you got?

33:51.246 --> 33:53.074
I think that
he's brought us here

33:53.118 --> 33:54.728
thinking it's about a wedding,

33:54.771 --> 33:56.643
but I think it's about more
than just a wedding.

33:57.470 --> 33:58.645
No. I don't think so.

33:58.688 --> 34:00.864
[Kent] You're already
here, Glenn.

34:00.908 --> 34:02.170
Could either of you afford
to leave?

34:02.214 --> 34:04.172
I mean, can either of you afford
to leave

34:04.216 --> 34:05.782
and not see for yourselves?

34:05.826 --> 34:08.219
[Glenn] Look.
Rory's his favorite son.

34:08.263 --> 34:09.917
I'm the outsider.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.266
Don't confuse it.

34:11.310 --> 34:12.485
-You know what, Glenn?
-What?

34:12.527 --> 34:13.572
That means we have
something in common.

34:13.616 --> 34:14.661
-Do we?
-Yeah, we're both outsiders.

34:14.704 --> 34:15.748
-Are we?
-Yeah.

34:15.792 --> 34:18.273
We both wanna get
what we deserve.

34:18.317 --> 34:20.449
All right?
We may not be brothers

34:20.493 --> 34:21.668
but I've spent my entire life

34:21.710 --> 34:23.061
helping you build
your father's firm.

34:23.103 --> 34:25.106
So I know what you're saying.

34:25.150 --> 34:27.935
What do we have to show for it?

34:28.762 --> 34:30.110
[Glenn] We?

34:30.155 --> 34:33.201
Tom, I run a minuscule firm
in Toronto. Okay?

34:33.245 --> 34:36.422
I got a couple of interns
mostly on the volunteer basis.

34:36.465 --> 34:40.252
I have problems selling
renovations to yuppies.

34:40.295 --> 34:42.688
That's my fucking world.
I don't we have much in common.

34:42.732 --> 34:43.777
You're a nice guy though.

34:43.820 --> 34:44.908
Glenn.

34:44.952 --> 34:46.170
-What?
-You're a very good designer.

34:46.214 --> 34:48.172
-How the fuck do you know?
-Because I know.

34:48.216 --> 34:49.826
Davenport follows your work.

34:49.870 --> 34:51.393
You may not think he does
but he does.

34:51.437 --> 34:53.003
And I have seen your stuff too.

34:53.047 --> 34:55.223
The Biennale entry was sublime.

34:56.964 --> 34:58.008
Sublime?

34:58.400 --> 35:00.924
Sublime.

35:00.968 --> 35:03.492
I think you oughta stick around
until Davenport gets here.

35:03.536 --> 35:05.233
What do you have to lose?
He's right.

35:07.192 --> 35:08.323
My pride.

35:08.367 --> 35:10.195
Oh, of course. Your pride.

35:10.238 --> 35:11.283
Fuck you.

35:11.326 --> 35:12.762
[Kent laughs]

35:12.806 --> 35:14.416
Look, I'm gonna stick it out.

35:14.460 --> 35:15.852
I think you'll regret it
if you don't.

35:15.896 --> 35:16.984
What's the worst scenario?

35:17.027 --> 35:18.464
You have to sit though
a tacky wedding

35:18.507 --> 35:21.031
and eat some
questionable catering.

35:21.075 --> 35:22.424
And spend time with family.

35:22.468 --> 35:23.556
[laughs]

35:23.599 --> 35:24.905
Now I'm gonna buy you a drink.

35:25.732 --> 35:26.950
[Glenn] So early?

35:26.994 --> 35:28.517
-Yeah.
-Nice.

35:28.561 --> 35:31.564
[foreboding music]

35:39.920 --> 35:41.574
[knocks on door]

35:41.617 --> 35:42.836
-[door opens]
-Hello?

35:42.879 --> 35:44.577
[Regan] Hey.

35:44.620 --> 35:47.841
Uh, I just wanted to see if
you needed help with anything.

35:47.884 --> 35:49.538
[Diana] Uh, no. No, thanks.

35:52.280 --> 35:53.412
Is that your dress?

35:54.239 --> 35:55.283
Yeah.

35:56.850 --> 35:57.981
Can I see it?

35:59.157 --> 36:00.636
Yeah, sure. Help yourself.

36:02.377 --> 36:04.118
[Regan] Actually, no.
Um, on you.

36:05.554 --> 36:06.555
Um...

36:07.600 --> 36:08.601
Yeah.

36:15.869 --> 36:18.132
[Regan] You have
a great body. Wow.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.742
[Diana] Thank you.

36:19.786 --> 36:21.353
All this time that
we worked together,

36:21.396 --> 36:23.224
I guess it was one of those
little things I never noticed.

36:24.486 --> 36:25.792
I mean, my dad must've, but...

36:28.011 --> 36:31.189
I don't know how, uh,
anyone gets close to him.

36:32.364 --> 36:33.930
He's always been so detached.

36:35.671 --> 36:37.151
He loves you.

36:42.112 --> 36:43.549
[sighs]
Um, I don't know.

36:44.376 --> 36:46.116
You could use something.

36:47.292 --> 36:48.423
Well, I didn't want
to think formal,

36:48.467 --> 36:50.686
I mean, it's just
a garden wedding.

36:50.730 --> 36:53.907
Yeah, I know. But we should
add a little something to it.

36:53.950 --> 36:55.430
Oh, I have this woman
that I go to sometimes,

36:55.474 --> 36:57.650
we could drop by.
She could fix it up.

36:57.693 --> 36:59.129
I've gotta organize the catering

36:59.173 --> 37:01.175
and the flowers and...

37:01.219 --> 37:02.263
You can delegate.

37:03.438 --> 37:04.570
It's not a secret anymore

37:04.613 --> 37:06.615
and God knows Tom wants
to be kept busy.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.358
[both chuckle]

37:10.402 --> 37:12.926
Just never imagined myself
picking up catering

37:12.969 --> 37:14.362
for Davenport's wedding.

37:14.406 --> 37:15.755
-[Glenn] Yeah.
-Thanks for coming along.

37:15.798 --> 37:17.800
Yeah. Well, Kent wasn't
gonna get off his ass.

37:17.844 --> 37:19.759
You know him.

37:19.802 --> 37:21.282
-[cell phone ringing]
-Hmm?

37:26.156 --> 37:28.550
Hey, Tyler.

37:28.594 --> 37:30.900
Nope. Everybody's out picking up
things for the wedding.

37:32.815 --> 37:34.861
Yeah, everybody's fine.
I mean, Glenn was gonna leave

37:34.904 --> 37:37.472
but, uh, Tom and I
convinced him to stay.

37:39.344 --> 37:40.693
When are you guys showing up?

37:41.563 --> 37:43.826
[revving]

37:52.095 --> 37:53.314
Can I ask you something?

37:54.881 --> 37:55.882
Sure.

37:57.623 --> 37:58.841
Why did you marry Tom?

38:00.539 --> 38:02.367
Oh, he, um...

38:03.890 --> 38:05.326
He was a loyal foot solider.

38:07.110 --> 38:09.765
My dad always liked him.
He was...

38:09.809 --> 38:11.593
the kinda guy you could count on
to get the work done

38:11.637 --> 38:13.813
and never the kinda guy
that was gonna be a threat, so.

38:14.857 --> 38:15.989
And do you love him?

38:17.686 --> 38:18.687
Sure.

38:19.471 --> 38:20.559
Yeah, in a way.

38:23.779 --> 38:25.477
I guess our marriage is, um...

38:27.087 --> 38:30.177
more of a business arrangement,
if that makes any sense.

38:30.873 --> 38:31.961
It does.

38:34.399 --> 38:37.402
[somber music]

38:46.585 --> 38:48.717
[Davenport] Architects are
the artist is who will shape

38:48.761 --> 38:50.980
the textures

38:51.024 --> 38:53.200
and the landscapes
of the future.

38:54.506 --> 38:57.683
So it is our moral duty

38:57.726 --> 38:59.162
to protect the world

38:59.206 --> 39:03.906
from this appalling,
environmental degradation.

39:05.168 --> 39:07.519
This planet is our home.

39:09.434 --> 39:12.872
We are its stewards,
its caretakers...

39:14.134 --> 39:16.005
and nothing more.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.401
[Tom] I've been kissing
Davenport's ass for 20 years,

39:20.445 --> 39:22.577
I'd like a little piece.
I think I've earned it.

39:22.621 --> 39:24.187
I gotta see how
the weekend pans out

39:24.231 --> 39:26.364
but I got
a pretty big project going.

39:27.539 --> 39:29.410
Think I could use a partner.

39:29.454 --> 39:31.020
So, Tom, why not Davenport?

39:31.064 --> 39:33.371
Davenport would never go for it.
And without him,

39:33.414 --> 39:36.374
without the Lear name
it's a dead in the water.

39:36.417 --> 39:39.812
So I'm curious, Tom,
why won't Davenport go for it?

39:39.855 --> 39:41.857
[Tom] Well, he's got
pretty strict codes

39:41.901 --> 39:43.293
about architectural projects

39:43.337 --> 39:46.209
that don't meet
his environmental ideal.

39:46.253 --> 39:47.515
[Glenn] Okay,
so where is this project?

39:48.081 --> 39:49.299
China.

39:49.343 --> 39:50.736
[Glenn laughing]

39:50.779 --> 39:51.954
-[Wilhelmina] These fit.
-Wow.

39:51.998 --> 39:53.303
[Wilhelmina] Casual
for a wedding dress.

39:53.347 --> 39:55.218
Oh, well, we're just trying
to keep it simple.

39:55.262 --> 39:56.611
Yeah, but still,

39:56.655 --> 39:58.047
there's nothing simple
about a wedding, is there?

39:58.091 --> 40:00.615
Well, it's just
immediate family, so, yeah.

40:00.659 --> 40:02.138
Yeah.
[gasps]

40:02.182 --> 40:04.445
I don't know, I think such
a special occasion

40:04.489 --> 40:06.404
requires a very special dress.

40:06.447 --> 40:09.189
Sure! Sure, sure. But, I, uh,
I... I like this dress.

40:09.232 --> 40:11.017
I like it too.

40:11.060 --> 40:13.323
I just think we need
to zhoosh it up a bit

40:13.367 --> 40:16.326
and, um, give it
some more distinction.

40:16.370 --> 40:18.024
-[Regan] Exactly. Yeah, I agree.
-Yeah.

40:18.067 --> 40:19.242
-Yeah, um...
-[clears throat]

40:19.286 --> 40:20.287
Where's my...

40:26.641 --> 40:28.382
I'm gonna show you some flowers

40:28.426 --> 40:30.297
and you're gonna tell me
what you like.

40:30.340 --> 40:31.994
Who cares what I like,
you just pick 'em.

40:32.647 --> 40:33.866
I care.

40:36.042 --> 40:38.479
Pink or yellow?

40:38.523 --> 40:40.046
Or pink and yellow?

40:40.089 --> 40:41.961
Too... too traditional.

40:44.267 --> 40:47.270
[light music]

40:54.060 --> 40:55.278
What do you think?

40:56.062 --> 40:57.933
I like it.

40:57.977 --> 41:00.588
I mean, it's simple
but with a certain something.

41:00.632 --> 41:02.285
Not too sexy.

41:02.329 --> 41:03.417
-No.
-Wouldn't want Davenport

41:03.461 --> 41:05.898
-having a heart attack.
-[chuckles]

41:05.941 --> 41:08.204
Davenport's in very good shape
for a man of his age.

41:08.248 --> 41:09.597
Well, he should be.

41:09.641 --> 41:11.860
I mean, you look good
enough to eat.

41:11.904 --> 41:13.166
What do you think?

41:19.738 --> 41:20.956
[sniffles]

41:21.000 --> 41:22.480
-[both] Oh.
-[sobbing]

41:22.523 --> 41:23.959
Oh, are you... are you okay?

41:24.003 --> 41:25.439
-[Wilhelmina] You're all right.
-Okay, hold on. Hold on.

41:25.483 --> 41:26.440
-You're good, you're good.
-[sobs]

41:27.876 --> 41:29.791
-Is it the dress?
-[crying]

41:29.835 --> 41:31.532
No, it's not the dress.
[sniffles]

41:32.577 --> 41:33.621
I'll get you a drink.

41:33.665 --> 41:35.710
-Jesus.
-[Diana sobbing]

41:35.754 --> 41:37.973
-Are you okay?
-[Diana] I just never...

41:38.017 --> 41:39.105
[sniffles]
I never thought

41:39.148 --> 41:40.846
I'd end up like this.

41:40.889 --> 41:42.195
Like this.
[crying]

41:42.238 --> 41:44.110
Well then, what, like what?

41:44.153 --> 41:45.720
I mean, you...
you look beautiful,

41:45.764 --> 41:48.157
you're marrying a really rich
and successful older man.

41:48.201 --> 41:50.116
-I mean, it could be worse.
-I know.

41:50.159 --> 41:53.249
I know I should be...
I should be really grateful.

41:53.293 --> 41:54.729
I know that, I just...

41:54.773 --> 41:56.078
I just imagined

41:56.122 --> 41:58.341
it would be different.
That's all.

41:58.385 --> 41:59.386
[gasps]

42:01.431 --> 42:03.172
[Tom] The Chinese are crazy.

42:03.216 --> 42:05.131
All right, they have more money
then they know what to do with.

42:05.174 --> 42:08.090
But they are obsessed
with having a Lear project.

42:08.134 --> 42:09.222
Yeah, but even with me
helping you,

42:09.265 --> 42:10.658
it still wouldn't be
a Lear project.

42:10.702 --> 42:12.399
[Tom] Uh, well, first of all
you are a Lear.

42:12.442 --> 42:15.315
But I can also sell them
on the legacy idea.

42:15.358 --> 42:17.056
But why can't you just make
the deal with the Chinese

42:17.099 --> 42:18.797
and use Regan as your partner?

42:18.840 --> 42:21.234
Regan doesn't wanna do anything
that even smacks of...

42:22.452 --> 42:23.845
Behind Davenport's back.

42:23.889 --> 42:25.630
Look, I don't know how
I feel about that myself.

42:25.673 --> 42:26.892
[Tom] You can do what you want,

42:26.935 --> 42:28.502
you're not a part
of this company.

42:28.546 --> 42:30.460
You never have been. You're free
to make your own decisions.

42:30.504 --> 42:33.159
And by the way, you are a Lear.

42:33.202 --> 42:34.595
From what I understand
from Davenport,

42:34.639 --> 42:35.944
you could use the money.

42:35.988 --> 42:37.772
He told you that?

42:37.816 --> 42:39.121
Well, he implied it once.

42:39.165 --> 42:40.688
[Glenn] What did he say?

42:40.732 --> 42:41.950
It doesn't matter.

42:42.603 --> 42:43.561
Tell me.

42:45.040 --> 42:46.128
-Tell me.
-[Tom] He said

42:46.172 --> 42:48.130
that you are stubborn

42:48.174 --> 42:49.828
and that your firm
will always be...

42:51.177 --> 42:52.526
a two-bit operation.

42:52.570 --> 42:54.572
-Two-bit operation.
-[Tom] That's what he said.

42:54.615 --> 42:56.269
What a fucking prick.

42:56.312 --> 42:58.010
Well, he still admired
your Biennale project.

42:58.053 --> 42:59.533
-We all did. I told you.
-[Glenn] Yeah, sure.

42:59.577 --> 43:00.708
Sure he did.

43:00.752 --> 43:02.971
He saw it. We all saw it.

43:03.015 --> 43:04.103
Man, it was...

43:04.146 --> 43:05.583
Yeah, sublime.
Yeah, I know, I get it.

43:06.453 --> 43:07.497
[scoffs]

43:08.586 --> 43:09.587
All right, I'll do it.

43:10.892 --> 43:12.154
-Really?
-[Glenn] Yeah.

43:12.198 --> 43:13.678
-You sure?
-Sure.

43:13.721 --> 43:15.288
I'll partner with you
on the China project.

43:15.331 --> 43:16.594
That's fantastic.

43:16.637 --> 43:17.769
I don't know anything about it.

43:17.812 --> 43:19.814
[Tom] You will,
you're gonna love it.

43:19.858 --> 43:22.121
And I'm gonna be more than
just a name you can use. Okay?

43:22.164 --> 43:23.818
-[Tom] Yeah, of course.
-I wanna see your plans.

43:23.862 --> 43:25.777
I wanna have legitimate
input on stuff.

43:25.820 --> 43:28.083
That is the whole idea.

43:28.127 --> 43:29.476
It's gonna be great.

43:30.390 --> 43:32.479
[revving]

43:37.702 --> 43:39.225
Davenport, are you here?

43:39.921 --> 43:41.444
[Regan] Dad?

43:41.488 --> 43:43.925
Well, here's the happy crew.

43:43.969 --> 43:45.231
He said he'd be here for dinner.

43:46.319 --> 43:47.625
So you spoke to him?

43:47.668 --> 43:49.148
Well, Tyler actually.

43:49.191 --> 43:50.497
Well, as long
as you have a drink,

43:50.540 --> 43:52.064
you know, table for one.
Good for you.

43:52.107 --> 43:53.979
-[Kent chuckles]
-I asked him to call.

44:06.687 --> 44:09.647
[mellow music]

44:17.263 --> 44:18.525
[knocks on door]

44:21.833 --> 44:23.051
Can I come in?

44:24.966 --> 44:25.967
[Glenn] Sure.

44:27.752 --> 44:29.101
Okay, that's far enough.

44:29.144 --> 44:30.972
Oh, come on. You're no fun.

44:32.800 --> 44:34.454
I don't bite.

44:34.497 --> 44:36.064
Listen, I, uh...

44:36.108 --> 44:37.805
I need you to get dressed,
young lady.

44:37.849 --> 44:39.241
-Okay?
-Young lady?

44:39.285 --> 44:40.416
Yeah, you're barely 18.

44:40.460 --> 44:42.375
-So?
-So your mother will kill me.

44:42.418 --> 44:43.724
I won't tell.

44:43.768 --> 44:44.769
Look, you don't...

44:46.640 --> 44:48.076
-Okay, listen...
-[knocks on door]

44:48.120 --> 44:49.382
Uh, yeah, hello?

44:50.122 --> 44:51.384
[Diana] It's Diana.

44:51.427 --> 44:52.907
Yeah, yeah, come on in.
I'm just, uh,

44:52.951 --> 44:54.561
I'm just getting dressed.

44:54.604 --> 44:55.693
[grunts]

44:56.781 --> 44:59.479
[exhales]
Yeah, come on in.

44:59.522 --> 45:00.828
-Is everything all right?
-[Glenn] Yeah.

45:00.872 --> 45:02.612
Yeah, just, uh,
putting my pants on.

45:02.656 --> 45:05.441
Of course, you are.
Glenn pants on is pants off.

45:05.485 --> 45:06.965
-What's what supposed to mean?
-[Diana] You know exactly

45:07.008 --> 45:08.706
what that's gonna mean.

45:08.749 --> 45:10.577
[Glenn] What's going on?
You all right? You look upset.

45:10.620 --> 45:11.926
-What's going on here?
-No.

45:11.970 --> 45:14.320
No, I'm not all right,
I'm not all right...

45:14.363 --> 45:16.409
I thought I knew
what I was doing

45:16.452 --> 45:18.585
with Davenport, I really did.
It's just, uh...

45:18.628 --> 45:20.152
I'm just not
thinking clearly, Glenn.

45:20.195 --> 45:21.762
[Glenn] Right. No, I understand.

45:21.806 --> 45:22.850
I understand how it is.
But listen,

45:22.894 --> 45:24.286
-could you do me a favor...
-No.

45:24.330 --> 45:25.984
-Come on, come on.
-I'm just, uh...

45:26.027 --> 45:27.725
I thought I loved him, Glenn.

45:27.768 --> 45:29.901
I really did but now
that you're here I just...

45:29.944 --> 45:31.206
-I don't know, I'm just not
-Okay, okay.

45:31.250 --> 45:32.425
-sure.
-Can we have this conversation

45:32.468 --> 45:34.906
a little bit later
in the hallway. Can we?

45:34.949 --> 45:36.168
Listen, let's have
this conversation...

45:36.211 --> 45:37.430
-You're pushing me away again.
-No. No, no.

45:37.473 --> 45:39.127
I'm not. I just want you
to go to the hallway

45:39.171 --> 45:40.781
and then talk
and we'll take a walk.

45:40.825 --> 45:41.739
-Oh, god.
-Okay?

45:41.782 --> 45:42.740
-[Diana] Okay.
-Okay, great.

45:44.437 --> 45:45.612
Okay?

45:45.655 --> 45:47.048
Just wait there
in the hallway. Okay?

45:50.138 --> 45:51.139
[exhales]

45:54.012 --> 45:55.448
[scoffs]

45:55.491 --> 45:57.842
Well, that was interesting.

45:57.885 --> 46:00.279
Listen, kid.
You're killing me, okay?

46:00.322 --> 46:02.324
I'm pushing 50
and you're driving me crazy.

46:02.368 --> 46:03.543
I need you to
get dressed, please.

46:03.586 --> 46:04.718
-You're killing me.
-My mom has

46:04.762 --> 46:05.893
a thing for you.

46:05.937 --> 46:07.199
-She had a thing for me
--[Delia] Oh.

46:07.242 --> 46:08.766
It was 20 years ago.
I was young,

46:08.809 --> 46:11.290
-she was young we were...
-Oh, I think it's still a thing

46:11.333 --> 46:12.770
-It's not, it's not, it's not...
-Don't...

46:12.813 --> 46:14.684
Don't worry, I'm not jealous.

46:14.728 --> 46:17.252
Actually, I think
it's kinda sexy.

46:17.296 --> 46:18.732
[panting]

46:18.776 --> 46:20.342
Oh, my god. Listen,
you gotta go.

46:20.386 --> 46:22.040
Here we go. This way. Okay.

46:22.083 --> 46:23.737
Listen, come on, come on.

46:23.781 --> 46:25.783
Okay. This way, okay.

Regan. Sorry,
I thought you were Delia.

47:05.866 --> 47:07.433
What, she's stalking you now?

47:07.476 --> 47:09.435
Yeah, it started this afternoon.

47:10.915 --> 47:12.177
You should have seen
what happened earlier

at Will's place. Oh, my god.
[chuckles]

47:16.137 --> 47:17.225

and she completely started
losing it.

Where the fuck
is Davenport anyway.

47:21.751 --> 47:22.970
-Fucking disaster.
-Hell, if I know.

47:27.192 --> 47:28.846
Rory, you got me thinking...

47:30.151 --> 47:32.762
[sighs]
I have to stop living this lie.

47:34.373 --> 47:35.461
What do you mean?

47:37.767 --> 47:39.682
My whole life with Tom.
My marriage.

47:39.726 --> 47:41.293
It's a... It's a fucking joke.

47:42.990 --> 47:45.123
Regan, we can't go back there.

47:45.166 --> 47:46.864
We were just kids
playing around.

47:46.907 --> 47:48.169
You know, it's what kids do.

47:48.213 --> 47:50.563
Yeah, when I'm with you
I'm transported back.

47:50.606 --> 47:52.217
-It's fucked up and you know it.
-Okay.

47:52.260 --> 47:54.132
So it's fucked up
but it's how I feel

47:54.175 --> 47:56.134
and it's tearing
me apart inside.

47:56.177 --> 47:58.310
We're twins, okay?

47:58.353 --> 47:59.441
And you're closer to me than

47:59.485 --> 48:01.574
-anyone in this world.
-I know.

48:01.617 --> 48:04.446
We share all this DNA and...

48:04.490 --> 48:06.361
and of course
we have this crazy bond.

48:08.624 --> 48:09.712
But...

48:09.756 --> 48:10.931
[Regan] So you love me?

48:12.498 --> 48:14.152
-'Course I do.
-Okay.

48:14.195 --> 48:15.457
Okay, then say it.

Tyler, hi, where are you?

48:40.134 --> 48:42.354
Okay, well, just get here
as soon as you can.

48:50.405 --> 48:55.323
Uh, that was Tyler,
your father's delayed, um...

48:55.367 --> 48:58.979
I don't know, he's in a plane,
there's a storm, um, so...

48:59.023 --> 49:00.241
Hm.

49:00.285 --> 49:01.895
They're gonna wait to be
cleared for takeoff,

49:01.939 --> 49:03.636
so we might as well
continue dinner without him.

49:04.158 --> 49:05.159
Again.

49:06.378 --> 49:07.509
He's not coming.

49:10.773 --> 49:12.471
Funny how he called us all here

49:12.514 --> 49:14.690
like it was some bloody life
or death situation

49:14.734 --> 49:15.822
and he's not even here.

49:16.954 --> 49:18.477
He's not even here.

49:18.520 --> 49:19.739
[chuckles]

49:21.132 --> 49:22.481
Maybe he doesn't exist.

49:24.178 --> 49:27.529
Maybe he's the Wizard of Oz.

49:27.573 --> 49:29.270
Stop being
so fucking melodramatic.

49:29.314 --> 49:31.403
He's coming,
it's just a weather delay.

49:31.446 --> 49:33.013
How come you always seem to know

49:33.057 --> 49:35.668
so much about
what Davenport is doing?

49:35.711 --> 49:36.930
I don't know anything.
All I said

49:36.974 --> 49:38.584
was that he's coming.
I don't think anyone

49:38.627 --> 49:40.325
really knows
what Davenport's up to.

49:40.368 --> 49:42.240
-He's an enigma.
-[Glenn scoffs]

49:43.719 --> 49:45.678
He's not an enigma.

49:45.721 --> 49:48.681
I think he's a
manipulative-punitive patriarch

49:48.724 --> 49:51.423
who's kept all his kids
on a leash.

49:51.466 --> 49:53.033
Except for the old one
he disowned.

49:53.077 --> 49:54.339
But you know
what the real problem is

49:54.382 --> 49:55.905
with you guys, is that
you could never quite

49:55.949 --> 49:57.951
get yourselves off dad's leash,
could you?

49:57.995 --> 49:59.431
I'm not on a leash.

49:59.474 --> 50:01.520
It's Tom an Regan's story,
it's not mine.

50:01.563 --> 50:03.957
Well, some of us are expected
to work for a living.

50:04.001 --> 50:05.089
[Rory] Tom,

50:05.132 --> 50:06.394
you've never had
to build anything

50:06.438 --> 50:08.527
from scratch like Glenn.

50:08.570 --> 50:10.224
He may not have much
to show for it

50:10.268 --> 50:12.531
but at least he's been given
the privilege of independence.

50:13.532 --> 50:14.881
Thanks for the kind words, kid.

50:17.405 --> 50:19.494
To be honest, I would've...

50:19.538 --> 50:21.801
given my left arm for what you
and Regan had with dad.

50:24.108 --> 50:26.153
Well, it's hard to be a Lear
I guess, uh,

50:26.197 --> 50:27.459
if you're not the Lear.

50:28.155 --> 50:29.417
[Glenn chuckles]

50:29.461 --> 50:32.072
I thought of changing
my profession, Delia.

50:32.116 --> 50:34.161
I thought of fucking
retiring completely.

50:34.205 --> 50:37.164
[Diana] Yeah, we all know
you're need to, uh...

50:37.208 --> 50:39.079
give up when
the going gets though, Glenn.

50:39.123 --> 50:40.341
I don't give up on things, okay?

50:40.385 --> 50:41.821
-I kept at it. Thank you.
-Yeah.

50:41.864 --> 50:43.953
You, you're afraid
to take responsibility

50:43.997 --> 50:45.477
-for your own name.
-[Glenn] That's not true.

50:45.520 --> 50:47.653
[Kent] Oh, I think it is true.

50:47.696 --> 50:49.959
I'm just saying,
Glenn had to do it on his own.

50:52.005 --> 50:53.746
Regan and I worked for the firm,

50:53.789 --> 50:55.922
she still does
but I couldn't take it anymore.

50:56.836 --> 50:58.185
Oh, so that's why you left,

50:58.229 --> 50:59.665
'cause you couldn't
take it anymore, that's why?

50:59.708 --> 51:00.927
[Rory] Yeah.

51:00.970 --> 51:02.494
Riding my motorcycle
through South America

51:02.537 --> 51:04.322
was incredibly therapeutic.

51:04.365 --> 51:06.106
[Diana] And who paid for that?

51:06.150 --> 51:07.890
This, uh, voyage
of self-discovery.

51:07.934 --> 51:09.588
-I did.
-Oh, really?

51:09.631 --> 51:12.765
Really? You don't work.
You never have.

51:12.808 --> 51:14.810
Yeah, I actually never have
thought to ask,

51:14.854 --> 51:16.551
but how... how do you
make a living, Rory?

51:17.596 --> 51:19.032
[Diana] Tell them.

51:19.076 --> 51:20.294
Tell them what?

51:20.338 --> 51:21.730
Oh, here it comes.

51:21.774 --> 51:23.863
[Diana] Davenport has
given him money every month

51:23.906 --> 51:25.734
for years.

51:25.778 --> 51:26.953
[Glenn snaps]
I fucking knew it.

51:26.996 --> 51:28.911
[laughs]
Of course he does.

51:28.955 --> 51:31.044
-What's that supposed to mean?
-[laughs]

51:31.088 --> 51:33.220
It means that
the golden boy is living off

51:33.264 --> 51:35.353
the golden old man still.

51:35.396 --> 51:37.616
All this free spirit bullshit.

51:37.659 --> 51:38.965
You're a trust fund kid.

51:39.008 --> 51:41.141
I respect that.

51:41.185 --> 51:44.710
But not a kid anymore
and it is a handout.

51:44.753 --> 51:46.799
-[Glenn laughs]
-Sure, Glenn.

51:46.842 --> 51:47.930
Whatever you say.

51:49.106 --> 51:50.498
Hey, I've never seen
any of it, okay?

51:50.542 --> 51:51.804
Not a thin red dime.

51:51.847 --> 51:53.501
Well, even if he offered
anything to me

51:53.545 --> 51:54.807
I wouldn't take the dime.

51:54.850 --> 51:56.156
[Glenn] Oh, we'll see
about that, tough guy.

51:56.200 --> 51:59.116
Look, Davenport's human, okay?

51:59.159 --> 52:01.205
if it was up to me I would have
done things differently.

52:01.248 --> 52:03.729
But if you think he's
what's been holding you back,

52:03.772 --> 52:05.252
what bullshit!

52:05.296 --> 52:07.298
Get over it! Get over yourself.

52:09.082 --> 52:10.257
Touché.

52:10.301 --> 52:11.432
You know, incredibly,
actually I thought

52:11.476 --> 52:12.694
this time would be different.

52:13.956 --> 52:15.349
I thought that
near the end of his life

52:15.393 --> 52:17.438
that Davenport would actually
try to reconcile himself

52:17.482 --> 52:19.527
to his abandoned son if...

52:19.571 --> 52:21.529
[scoffs]
Glenn.

52:21.573 --> 52:24.271
He didn't abandon you,
he just hated your mother, okay?

52:24.315 --> 52:25.664
-[Kent chuckles]
-He was trying to get away

52:25.707 --> 52:27.187
from her clawing neediness,
don't you get that?

52:27.231 --> 52:28.710
[Glenn] Yeah, she's
real fucking needy.

52:28.754 --> 52:30.538
That neediness is paid for
by the government of Canada,

52:30.582 --> 52:31.583
okay?

52:33.889 --> 52:34.977
And she's doing really well.

52:35.021 --> 52:36.631
She's got
three geriatric roommates

52:36.675 --> 52:38.242
that she spends
most nights with.

52:38.285 --> 52:40.635
They all fucking drool and cry
and wail through the night.

52:40.679 --> 52:42.811
It's fucking sublime,
you should come visit.

52:42.855 --> 52:44.422
[Regan] I'm sorry, Glenn.

52:44.465 --> 52:46.424
Watching my mother die
was no picnic.

52:47.599 --> 52:49.340
-Okay?
-[Glenn] I could appreciate that

52:49.383 --> 52:50.471
but at least you had Davenport

52:50.515 --> 52:51.646
-to pull her through.
-Yes.

52:51.690 --> 52:53.126
She did, didn't she?

52:53.170 --> 52:54.693
'Cause she was
the love of his life.

52:55.998 --> 52:57.696
-I was in love once.
-Oh!

52:57.739 --> 52:59.741
-Here we go. Mm-hmm.
-I mean, not with your father.

52:59.785 --> 53:02.440
I'm... I'm settling
for your father but...

53:02.483 --> 53:06.052
I couldn't be with the one
that I really loved.

53:06.095 --> 53:09.708
Oh, god. I loved him.

53:09.751 --> 53:11.536
But, um...

53:11.579 --> 53:14.930
He acted like
I never existed, so...

53:14.974 --> 53:17.063
And I wasn't gonna be alone.

53:17.106 --> 53:19.631
And I want to make sure
that Delia was taken care of,

53:19.674 --> 53:22.242
so even if he couldn't...

53:22.286 --> 53:25.071
I made bloody sure his family
would take care of her.

53:26.333 --> 53:27.813
Mom, what are you saying?

53:30.076 --> 53:31.860
[Diana] I'm saying that
Glenn is your father.

53:32.470 --> 53:33.688
What?

53:33.732 --> 53:35.037
-[Regan] What?
-[Tom, Kent and Rory] What?

53:35.081 --> 53:36.909
That's ridiculous.
You just told us last night

53:36.952 --> 53:38.780
that Davenport was her father.

53:38.824 --> 53:40.956
Davenport's my father?

53:41.000 --> 53:42.262
[Glenn] You're just angry
at Davenport

53:42.306 --> 53:43.959
and that's why
you're making a scene correct?

53:44.003 --> 53:45.396
Are you denying
you slept with me?

53:45.439 --> 53:47.224
[Glenn] That was years ago,
what about Davenport?

53:47.267 --> 53:48.573
I didn't sleep with Davenport

53:48.616 --> 53:50.314
until after I was pregnant
because guess what?

53:50.357 --> 53:51.793
I assumed

53:51.837 --> 53:54.274
that you wouldn't manage
to be there for me.

53:57.103 --> 53:58.757
[Glenn] What a story.

53:58.800 --> 54:01.847
[Kent] Oh, where's
all that compassion, Glenn?

54:01.890 --> 54:03.414
[Diana] You know, um, Glenn,

54:03.457 --> 54:05.372
used to come down to LA
looking for his father

54:05.416 --> 54:08.462
and, um, he was always busy
or he was traveling,

54:08.506 --> 54:09.898
and I just...
I couldn't understand it.

54:09.942 --> 54:12.379
I just... I couldn't understand

54:12.423 --> 54:14.686
how a father could hurt
his son like that.

54:17.645 --> 54:20.431
We slept together
on the fourth of July

54:20.474 --> 54:23.782
and, oh, my god
there were fireworks.

54:23.825 --> 54:25.958
Nine months later Delia arrived.

54:27.002 --> 54:28.569
[Rory] Ah...

54:28.613 --> 54:32.181
So the wounded prodigal son
has some baggage of his own.

54:32.225 --> 54:33.270
[chuckles]
Of course he does.

54:33.313 --> 54:34.532
[Diana] Have a look at her.

54:34.575 --> 54:36.447
Look at her.
Take a really good look at her

54:36.490 --> 54:38.884
because she is yours, Glenn.
She is yours.

54:38.927 --> 54:40.973
I mean, I asked Regan,
I mean today in the dressmakers.

54:41.016 --> 54:42.540
I just... I couldn't do it.

54:42.583 --> 54:44.063
You know, if you're not willing
to step up

54:44.106 --> 54:45.543
to your responsibilities
for your kid that's fine,

54:45.586 --> 54:47.893
because you know what?
Davenport will.

54:47.936 --> 54:51.897
Because the wrong Lear is better
than no Lear at all.

54:56.118 --> 54:58.077
You're my father?

54:58.120 --> 54:59.861
-You tried to kiss me.
-I don't know.

54:59.905 --> 55:01.907
-I did not try to kiss you.
-[Diana] You tried to kiss her?

55:01.950 --> 55:03.343
[Glenn] She's been throwing
herself at everybody

55:03.387 --> 55:05.389
since we got here,
ask Rory and ask Kent.

55:05.432 --> 55:07.086
[Diana] Sorry, you wanted
to have sex with your daughter?

55:07.129 --> 55:08.348
Listen, she's not my...
You're not my daughter.

55:08.392 --> 55:09.610
-You're not my daughter.
-[Diana] Oh, no? No?

55:09.654 --> 55:11.308
How do you know?
How do you know? Do you...

55:11.351 --> 55:12.744
Do you deny having sex with me?

55:12.787 --> 55:14.311
-Do you?
-[Glenn] It was 20 years ago

55:14.354 --> 55:16.443
and I was fucking drunk,
and I don't remember.

55:16.487 --> 55:19.185
Wait, so this...
All this, this...

55:19.228 --> 55:21.927
The breakdowns, the misgivings,
what, you couldn't have just

55:21.970 --> 55:24.016
-told us that it was Glenn?
-Well, I didn't want

55:24.059 --> 55:25.322
-to complicate everything.
-Oh!

55:25.365 --> 55:27.019
I don't think
it could be more complicated.

55:27.062 --> 55:29.326
Diana is in love with Glenn.

55:29.369 --> 55:31.806
Glenn would rather be having sex
with his daughter,

55:31.850 --> 55:36.811
who's aunt, my wife Regan
is totally infatuated

55:36.855 --> 55:38.291
with her brother Rory

55:38.335 --> 55:41.250
whose other brother Kent
will fuck anything that walks!

55:41.294 --> 55:44.210
And Tom who would love
to sell Davenports company

55:44.253 --> 55:45.820
to the fucking Chinese

55:45.864 --> 55:47.561
if he could have five minutes
alone with them

55:47.605 --> 55:48.823
so he could sign the papers.

55:48.867 --> 55:50.564
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
-[clamoring]

55:50.608 --> 55:54.176
It's a... It's a...
It's an autonomous franchise.

55:54.220 --> 55:55.395
[Glenn] Bullshit!

55:55.439 --> 55:57.397
It's an autonomous franchise.

55:57.441 --> 55:59.704
He knows. He will know.

55:59.747 --> 56:02.402
I don't, I don't wanna even
be tied to this family anymore.

56:02.446 --> 56:04.535
You know, the word incestuous
come to mind.

56:04.578 --> 56:06.014
-[Tom] Yeah, you think?
-I didn't wanna

56:06.058 --> 56:08.408
have sex with anyone.
I didn't know he was my father.

56:08.452 --> 56:09.844
[Rory] There's no proof
to any of this.

56:09.888 --> 56:11.716
Diana's probably making
the whole thing up.

56:11.759 --> 56:14.327
[Diana] Oh, yeah? Well, like
the night we spent together?

56:14.371 --> 56:15.937
-[Regan] Oh, what now, are you
-[Glenn] What the fuck?

56:15.981 --> 56:17.504
-saying you slept with Rory?
-What are you talking about?

56:17.548 --> 56:18.940
-[Glenn] Him?
-[Diana] Why don't you

56:18.984 --> 56:20.855
tell them all, Rory?

56:20.899 --> 56:22.117
You slept with him?

56:24.598 --> 56:25.599
Rory?

56:26.513 --> 56:27.775
You fucking slut!

56:27.819 --> 56:29.124
-[Tom] Regan!
-What, did you fuck our entire

56:29.168 --> 56:30.212
-Come on!
-family?

56:30.256 --> 56:31.997
Shut up, Tom!

56:32.040 --> 56:34.347
This has nothing to do with you.
Goddamnit!

56:36.131 --> 56:39.308
[Delia] So is Rory my father
or is Glenn my father?

56:39.352 --> 56:42.007
I'm not your father,
I slept with your mom last year.

56:42.050 --> 56:43.487
You don't look
like a newborn to me.

56:43.530 --> 56:45.532
I'm gonna get some whiskey
and a cigar.

56:45.576 --> 56:46.620
Oh, yeah.

56:46.664 --> 56:48.927
Have her DNA tested
by all means.

56:48.970 --> 56:50.537
Glenn, do. But you know what?

56:50.581 --> 56:54.498
your two middle toes
are webbed and so are Delia's.

56:54.541 --> 56:56.500
-Do not talk about my toes.
-It's a coincidence.

56:56.543 --> 56:58.066
-Okay? That's a coincidence.
-I'm sorry.

56:58.110 --> 56:59.590
Oh, really? Really?

56:59.633 --> 57:00.852
No, it's not a coincidence.

57:00.895 --> 57:02.070
But look, here's the thing,

57:02.114 --> 57:04.421
if you don't wanna take
your relationship

57:04.464 --> 57:07.119
with me seriously
and if you don't want to step up

57:07.162 --> 57:09.600
and take responsibility
for your daughter,

57:09.643 --> 57:11.384
well then, your dad will.

57:11.428 --> 57:12.603
Because I will not...

57:12.646 --> 57:15.344
Delia will not be cut out
of this family!

57:15.388 --> 57:19.392
And if my best option
is marrying an old man...

57:19.436 --> 57:22.177
well, fuck me
that's what I'm gonna do.

57:22.221 --> 57:23.483
Don't forget about
the side project with Rory,

57:23.527 --> 57:24.876
'cause then you'll have
a nice fucking

57:24.919 --> 57:26.486
-Lear sandwich to gobble.
-[Diana] Yes, I will.

57:26.530 --> 57:28.532
-Fuck you!
-[Kent] Oh, this is nice!

57:28.575 --> 57:29.924
Okay?

57:29.968 --> 57:32.187
You just came here
because you thought Davenport

57:32.231 --> 57:34.407
was gonna divide up the spoils
between all of us, huh?

57:34.451 --> 57:35.800
[Glenn] You're here
for the same fucking reason.

57:35.843 --> 57:36.888
Who are you kidding?

57:36.931 --> 57:38.193
That and you lusting after

57:38.237 --> 57:40.761
-your brother, that's fucked up.
-Oh, fuck off!

57:40.805 --> 57:42.371
That's how you spell fucked up.

57:43.895 --> 57:45.374
[phone rings]

57:50.379 --> 57:51.468
Hello?

57:59.388 --> 58:00.738
[phone clatters]

58:01.695 --> 58:02.827
[Glenn] What's the matter?

58:02.870 --> 58:04.132
-[Regan] Diana?
-[Delia] Mom?

58:04.176 --> 58:06.004
Oh, my god.

58:06.047 --> 58:07.222
[Regan] Diana, what is it?

58:08.876 --> 58:10.487
Oh, my god, you're father.

58:12.184 --> 58:14.099
Your father had a heart attack
on the plane.

58:14.142 --> 58:15.535
-[Kent] What?
-[Tom] Shit.

58:15.579 --> 58:16.797
Oh, my god.

58:18.451 --> 58:20.279
He died, he died.

58:20.322 --> 58:23.761
What... He... No...
That's impossible.

58:23.804 --> 58:25.197
[sobs]
Oh, god.

58:26.546 --> 58:29.331
[approaching footsteps]

58:29.375 --> 58:30.637
-[sobbing]
-You okay?

58:30.681 --> 58:33.031
It's all right.
It's okay, it's okay.

58:35.207 --> 58:36.948
[crying]

58:44.129 --> 58:48.525
[sobbing continues]

58:49.743 --> 58:52.746
[somber music]

58:58.883 --> 59:01.407
[Davenport] I hang on
to one vision.

59:01.450 --> 59:06.847
And that is,
he who stops dreaming dies.

59:08.501 --> 59:11.199
He who stops hoping dies.

59:12.766 --> 59:14.551
So just hang in there folks.

59:15.203 --> 59:16.770
Contribute.

59:16.814 --> 59:20.078
Stand in a line
to make a difference.

59:20.121 --> 59:23.472
And at the end of the day
just get it done.

59:41.839 --> 59:44.015
No matter how we all feel
about our grievances...

59:45.712 --> 59:47.975
there's no denying that
we lost a great one today.

59:49.673 --> 59:50.761
[Rory] Here, here.

59:51.544 --> 59:53.285
[Tom] Well said.

59:53.328 --> 59:54.547
I'll drink to that.

59:57.463 --> 59:58.943
[Glenn] Yeah, I never
thought much about it.

01:00:02.816 --> 01:00:05.166
I guess I've been caught up
in my own resentments.

01:00:06.951 --> 01:00:09.301
You know I just remembered
my fishing rod.

01:00:09.344 --> 01:00:12.391
Yeah, that was my favorite thing
in the world when I was a boy.

01:00:12.434 --> 01:00:14.219
Davenport gave it to me.

01:00:14.262 --> 01:00:16.830
Maybe he had some business
back in Toronto, I'm not sure.

01:00:16.874 --> 01:00:19.877
Or maybe he was just coming
to see me I don't know.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:23.271
But he showed up at the house
and we got in the car

01:00:23.315 --> 01:00:25.665
and just went out to a lake.

01:00:25.709 --> 01:00:29.016
Davenport knew a guy
so he started talking to the guy

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:30.452
and after a few minutes
sure enough

01:00:30.496 --> 01:00:32.367
we were in a little fishing boat

01:00:32.411 --> 01:00:34.761
on our way out to the middle
of the lake, you know.

01:00:34.805 --> 01:00:36.154
Just me and Davenport

01:00:36.197 --> 01:00:39.592
and this fantastic
little fishing rod he got me.

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:42.900
He had a little tackle box
and box of worms

01:00:42.943 --> 01:00:47.774
and those nice little floats
that bob in the water.

01:00:47.818 --> 01:00:49.602
And we just fished, you know.

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:51.691
And then it happened.

01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:54.912
I got a bite or strike
as he called it, fishing lingo.

01:00:56.130 --> 01:00:57.479
[laughs]

01:00:57.523 --> 01:00:59.481
And then Davenport...

01:00:59.525 --> 01:01:02.180
he popped up and he helped
me reel in this magnificent fish

01:01:02.223 --> 01:01:03.747
and that thing
was like the length of my arm.

01:01:05.357 --> 01:01:07.881
And I remember him asking me,
"You wanna keep it?"

01:01:08.969 --> 01:01:10.231
Of course I did, but...

01:01:11.798 --> 01:01:13.278
But he made me kill it.

01:01:15.236 --> 01:01:17.325
This slimy thing it was
just trying to wiggle free

01:01:17.369 --> 01:01:18.936
in my hand.

01:01:18.979 --> 01:01:21.721
I was clumsily trying to,
you know, whack it in the head

01:01:21.765 --> 01:01:24.463
and he pulled out a pocket knife
and he showed me how to cut it,

01:01:24.506 --> 01:01:26.857
you know, make a fillet
and gut it and everything.

01:01:28.815 --> 01:01:30.991
So we just went back
to his friends property and...

01:01:33.254 --> 01:01:36.518
sat there under the stars
and just...

01:01:36.562 --> 01:01:38.912
cooked the fish in a skillet
with some butter, you know.

01:01:40.784 --> 01:01:42.220
Nothing ever tasted better.

01:01:45.614 --> 01:01:47.747
Davenport never spent
any time with me

01:01:47.791 --> 01:01:48.922
when I was growing up.

01:01:50.794 --> 01:01:53.013
And I know you think that
I didn't care, but I did.

01:01:55.189 --> 01:01:56.800
I had a pretty lonely childhood.

01:01:58.845 --> 01:02:01.848
But I do have Davenport to thank
for my success.

01:02:04.198 --> 01:02:05.678
He came to New York one time

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:09.116
and he whisked me off
to Meadowlands,

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:12.032
the... the horse track
in New Jersey, and, uh...

01:02:12.076 --> 01:02:14.861
It's a fantastic place
and he showed me how to

01:02:14.905 --> 01:02:18.169
pick horses, and we were at it
all day long, we lost a bundle.

01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:20.388
So much money.

01:02:21.955 --> 01:02:23.304
And that was the first
and last time

01:02:23.348 --> 01:02:26.394
that I ever used his money
for any kind of venture.

01:02:32.531 --> 01:02:34.185
And I guess
it was my introduction

01:02:34.228 --> 01:02:35.447
to picking winners.

01:02:35.490 --> 01:02:38.972
And I just moved from horses
to stock market.

01:02:39.016 --> 01:02:40.931
And it's remarkably
similar actually.

01:02:43.281 --> 01:02:44.282
So...

01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:47.546
thank you, Dad for...

01:02:48.852 --> 01:02:50.375
our wonderful day at the track.

01:02:53.204 --> 01:02:55.119
I bought my first bike with dad.

01:02:56.424 --> 01:02:57.904
I kinda tricked him into it,

01:02:57.948 --> 01:03:01.125
I told him I needed cash
to get a car.

01:03:01.168 --> 01:03:02.604
He agreed to give me the cash,

01:03:02.648 --> 01:03:06.086
but insisted on coming along
to meet the guy

01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:07.740
and he said
he knew a lot about cars,

01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:09.046
and he wanted to help.

01:03:09.089 --> 01:03:12.832
So we get there
and it's this middle-aged dude

01:03:12.876 --> 01:03:15.835
whose wife is forcing him
to sell his baby.

01:03:15.879 --> 01:03:17.184
So we go out back...

01:03:18.403 --> 01:03:22.842
and there it is,
this whole cool BMW.

01:03:22.886 --> 01:03:26.715
But I'm waiting for Davenport
to just, likely unload.

01:03:26.759 --> 01:03:28.369
Just... just completely
lose it on me.

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:32.417
But he doesn't
he just goes over to the guy

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:35.681
and starts talking
about the... the mileage,

01:03:35.724 --> 01:03:37.814
the year, the starter,
the engine.

01:03:37.857 --> 01:03:40.120
All this stuff that I...
I had no idea

01:03:40.164 --> 01:03:42.253
dad knew so much about...
about bikes.

01:03:45.473 --> 01:03:48.868
So he pays the guy in cash
and we get back in the car,

01:03:48.912 --> 01:03:50.478
and he says two things.
He says...

01:03:52.437 --> 01:03:57.311
"You have to get a safety course
and you're not allowed to die."

01:03:57.355 --> 01:03:58.835
[all laugh]

01:03:58.878 --> 01:04:00.706
[chuckles]

01:04:00.749 --> 01:04:01.968
I loved him for that.

01:04:07.017 --> 01:04:09.149
My dad story has
to do with prom.

01:04:11.935 --> 01:04:13.937
I of course, wanted
to go with Rory.

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:15.547
Dad didn't think
that was such a hot idea,

01:04:15.590 --> 01:04:19.333
so, you know,
I get pissed off as usual.

01:04:19.377 --> 01:04:22.989
And, uh, I'm gonna make
a moment of it,

01:04:23.033 --> 01:04:24.686
so I'll... I'll go with Mark.

01:04:25.644 --> 01:04:26.688
[scoffs]

01:04:26.732 --> 01:04:30.214
Mark's this absolute pig.

01:04:30.257 --> 01:04:32.042
I think I'm gonna
bring this loser around

01:04:32.085 --> 01:04:34.827
and really piss
old Davenport off.

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:38.613
Mark shows up at the house,
he's got this t-shirt with a tux

01:04:38.657 --> 01:04:40.702
-drawn on the front of it.
-[chuckles]

01:04:40.746 --> 01:04:43.618
Dad thinks
it's hilarious, right?

01:04:43.662 --> 01:04:45.446
Best thing he's ever seen.

01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:49.363
Invites him in, pours him
a nice fine glass of whiskey,

01:04:49.407 --> 01:04:50.799
I come down the stairs.

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.585
I'm obviously expecting
a disaster

01:04:53.628 --> 01:04:55.152
and they're
sitting there talking,

01:04:55.195 --> 01:04:58.720
and Davenport's in the middle
of some frat story of his.

01:04:58.764 --> 01:05:00.592
They're basically best pals
at this point

01:05:00.635 --> 01:05:01.941
and I'm getting really nervous

01:05:01.985 --> 01:05:04.422
because I don't want
to go to prom with this guy.

01:05:06.206 --> 01:05:07.686
Especially if he doesn't
even have the desired effect

01:05:07.729 --> 01:05:09.731
of pissing Davenport off.

01:05:09.775 --> 01:05:11.385
But it's too late.

01:05:12.604 --> 01:05:13.822
So we're off to the prom.

01:05:15.433 --> 01:05:18.305
It goes horribly
and I'm probably drunk.

01:05:19.524 --> 01:05:21.743
And next thing we know

01:05:21.787 --> 01:05:23.223
we're back at the house
parked outside

01:05:23.267 --> 01:05:24.485
in the middle
of the night and...

01:05:27.401 --> 01:05:29.316
Mark just starts trying
to fuck me.

01:05:31.144 --> 01:05:32.972
And I... I' m panicked. I...

01:05:33.016 --> 01:05:34.017
[Regan sniffles]

01:05:35.975 --> 01:05:37.194
You know, I try to push him off,

01:05:37.237 --> 01:05:39.544
I mean, he's huge
so there's not...

01:05:39.587 --> 01:05:42.025
There's not that much
that I can actually do.

01:05:42.068 --> 01:05:43.548
And thank God.
[scoffs]

01:05:46.029 --> 01:05:47.334
The car light turns on...

01:05:49.075 --> 01:05:50.337
and it's Davenport.

01:05:52.122 --> 01:05:53.297
He's dragging him out...

01:05:54.776 --> 01:05:56.909
just beating the shit
out of him.

01:05:58.389 --> 01:06:00.434
I really didn't know
Davenport had it in him.

01:06:00.478 --> 01:06:02.959
I mean,
he was amazing, like a...

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:08.007
like a trained boxer.
[chuckles]

01:06:08.051 --> 01:06:09.530
He's crying like a baby.

01:06:09.574 --> 01:06:11.619
He's bleeding everywhere,
all over his steering wheel

01:06:11.663 --> 01:06:13.143
as he drives away.

01:06:13.186 --> 01:06:14.971
And Davenport just stops...

01:06:18.365 --> 01:06:19.627
and he looks at me...

01:06:25.764 --> 01:06:27.635
and he says,
"You okay, buttercup?"

01:06:31.596 --> 01:06:33.685
[sniffles]

01:06:33.728 --> 01:06:35.992
He straightens my dress
and he walks me inside.

01:06:44.304 --> 01:06:45.479
For the record.

01:06:47.264 --> 01:06:50.180
I think we should just judge
a man by his actions.

01:06:52.443 --> 01:06:56.273
So sure,
Davenport was a great man.

01:06:57.839 --> 01:06:59.493
But I think he was just that.

01:07:00.755 --> 01:07:01.756
A man.

01:07:02.714 --> 01:07:05.238
Pros and cons. Flaws and all.

01:07:08.415 --> 01:07:09.938
And he is dead

01:07:09.982 --> 01:07:12.332
which is sad but

01:07:12.376 --> 01:07:14.943
I think we should just
remember him for what he was.

01:07:15.683 --> 01:07:16.815
A man.

01:07:17.555 --> 01:07:19.296
A womanizer.

01:07:20.297 --> 01:07:21.950
A huge ego.

01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:24.736
A father.

01:07:25.954 --> 01:07:29.349
A benefactor, a mentor.

01:07:29.393 --> 01:07:33.571
Neglectful. Forgetful.
Cold shoulder.

01:07:35.747 --> 01:07:37.053
But just a man...

01:07:38.532 --> 01:07:42.101
to be loved no more or no less
than he deserved.

01:07:43.842 --> 01:07:46.758
'Cause if you take away
this legacy,

01:07:46.801 --> 01:07:50.370
the buildings and the wise words

01:07:50.414 --> 01:07:52.720
and the money, then

01:07:52.764 --> 01:07:54.592
[scoffs]
what about the man is left

01:07:54.635 --> 01:07:55.810
for you to love?

01:07:57.595 --> 01:07:58.770
Father?

01:08:00.119 --> 01:08:01.120
Maybe.

01:08:02.121 --> 01:08:03.296
No more.

01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:07.126
Probably much less.

01:08:07.170 --> 01:08:08.997
I think that's
a little harsh, love.

01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:10.869
[Delia] No, Mom.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.350
It's what he deserves.

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.223
It's what
everyone really deserves.

01:08:18.268 --> 01:08:19.486
Honesty.

01:08:22.837 --> 01:08:24.143
A toast then.

01:08:25.884 --> 01:08:28.147
To the great Davenport Lear.

01:08:28.191 --> 01:08:30.323
-Davenport Lear.
-Davenport Lear.

01:08:30.367 --> 01:08:31.368
[glasses clink]

01:08:33.631 --> 01:08:35.459
[Tyler clears throat]

01:08:35.502 --> 01:08:39.245
I let myself in.
I'm sorry if I started you.

01:08:39.288 --> 01:08:41.595
You should know I've just come
from the hospital.

01:08:41.639 --> 01:08:43.814
They took his body there
as soon as we landed.

01:08:43.858 --> 01:08:44.903
[Regan] Oh, god.

01:08:44.946 --> 01:08:47.210
You should also know...

01:08:47.252 --> 01:08:49.125
something incredible
has happened.

01:08:51.038 --> 01:08:53.171
They revived him.

01:08:53.216 --> 01:08:54.390
-What are you talking about?
-[Delia] What?

01:08:54.434 --> 01:08:55.609
-[Tom] He's alive?
-[Glenn] How?

01:08:55.653 --> 01:08:56.915
-Are you serious right now?
-[Rory] How?

01:08:56.957 --> 01:09:00.005
[Tyler] He's under observation
but he's stable.

01:09:00.048 --> 01:09:01.093
Wait a minute, is this come kind

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:02.486
-of joke?
-You said he was lucid.

01:09:02.529 --> 01:09:03.965
[Tyler] I know you all have
a lot of questions.

01:09:04.009 --> 01:09:06.359
We'll know in the morning.
I suggest just...

01:09:06.403 --> 01:09:07.578
Just stay here

01:09:07.621 --> 01:09:09.232
and I'll report back
first thing.

01:09:10.537 --> 01:09:13.149
[Kent] Hey, Tyler, wait.
I'm coming with you.

01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:17.587
-[exhales]
-Oh, my god, Diana.

01:09:17.631 --> 01:09:18.850
-It's a miracle.
-[chuckles]

01:09:45.964 --> 01:09:48.095
What a fucking mess.

01:09:49.881 --> 01:09:51.011
[sighs]

01:09:51.055 --> 01:09:52.404
Do you think
they'll have the wedding?

01:09:56.714 --> 01:09:58.194
I guess so at some point.

01:10:01.022 --> 01:10:03.286
So you do
love Davenport after all.

01:10:05.244 --> 01:10:07.855
Yeah, of course.
I mean, he's my father.

01:10:09.988 --> 01:10:12.599
Even though he fucked you
for most of your life

01:10:12.643 --> 01:10:14.949
you'll always have
that fishing trip.

01:10:17.735 --> 01:10:19.215
Something like that.

01:10:21.478 --> 01:10:22.479
[door closes]

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:25.264
[Rory] What's wrong?

01:10:27.310 --> 01:10:28.441
I just...

01:10:29.834 --> 01:10:31.618
can't be on my own tonight,
that's all.

01:10:33.316 --> 01:10:34.534
Okay, uh...

01:10:36.101 --> 01:10:37.276
Mm.

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.365
What are you doing?

01:10:39.409 --> 01:10:41.715
Oh, just please don't make me
be on my own tonight.

01:10:43.151 --> 01:10:45.502
-I just want to kiss you.
-You can't even be here.

01:10:45.545 --> 01:10:46.764
Why?

01:10:46.807 --> 01:10:48.722
My, my dad.

01:10:52.770 --> 01:10:54.075
-[Diana] Hug me.
-[Rory] Diana...

01:10:54.119 --> 01:10:55.773
Oh, look. Stop.

01:10:55.816 --> 01:10:57.165
Diana, stop.

01:11:00.168 --> 01:11:01.909
I shoulda said
something before but...

01:11:03.650 --> 01:11:04.695
the thing is, uh...

01:11:06.653 --> 01:11:08.264
I'm in love with someone else.

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:10.831
Your sister.

01:11:14.444 --> 01:11:15.532
Make love to me.

01:11:16.924 --> 01:11:19.013
-Please, I need it.
-Diana...

01:11:19.057 --> 01:11:20.754
I really need this tonight.

01:11:20.798 --> 01:11:22.321
[Rory] You...

01:11:22.365 --> 01:11:24.149
-[Diana] Please.
-[Rory] Stop....

01:11:25.629 --> 01:11:26.673
-Fucking get off him.
-[Rory] Shit.

01:11:26.717 --> 01:11:28.284
-[Diana] Oh, my god.
-Get off of him.

01:11:28.327 --> 01:11:30.155
-Oh, my god, what are you doing?
-[Rory] Hey, what are you...

01:11:30.198 --> 01:11:31.243
Get off of him. Get...

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:32.331
-[Rory] Diana!
-What are you doing?

01:11:32.375 --> 01:11:33.593
-Don't you touch him.
-[Rory] Hey!

01:11:33.637 --> 01:11:35.116
-You shouldn't be touching him.
-Oh, my god!

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:36.988
Get off me! Don't touch me!

01:11:37.031 --> 01:11:38.468
-Hey! Wait, Diana!
-[Regan] You fucking slut!

01:11:38.511 --> 01:11:40.165
-Diana!
-Get the fuck off him!

01:11:40.208 --> 01:11:41.775
-Fucking get out!
-[Diana screams]

01:11:41.819 --> 01:11:43.299
[Rory] Just stay out.

01:11:44.125 --> 01:11:45.170
[door closes]

01:11:45.213 --> 01:11:48.216
[foreboding music]

01:11:57.617 --> 01:11:59.576
[Rory] So are we all headed
to the hospital this morning?

01:12:03.406 --> 01:12:05.582
-Davenport!
-[Davenport laughs]

01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:10.282
Oh, my god.
Let me give you all a hand.

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:12.502
I can't believe
they all showed up, Tyler.

01:12:13.459 --> 01:12:14.895
Oh, boy.

01:12:15.983 --> 01:12:18.072
What's going on?

01:12:18.116 --> 01:12:19.857
How come
none of you are dressed?

01:12:21.598 --> 01:12:23.600
Aren't we supposed
to attend a wedding?

01:12:23.643 --> 01:12:25.776
[Tom laughing]

01:12:25.819 --> 01:12:26.951
[Regan] You nut.

01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:34.262
[priest] We're gathered
here today

01:12:34.306 --> 01:12:38.702
in front of these
sacred mountains in Maliwoo.

01:12:38.745 --> 01:12:40.965
The mountain of my people
of the Chumash

01:12:41.008 --> 01:12:42.532
who lived and loved here.

01:12:42.575 --> 01:12:46.231
They hold witness
to this beautiful union today.

01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:49.626
We ask mother earth

01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:54.021
that she bless this marriage
with abundance

01:12:54.065 --> 01:12:56.328
and that you may grow stronger

01:12:56.372 --> 01:12:59.375
and more in love
through every season.

01:12:59.418 --> 01:13:03.422
We ask all the forces
of nature here today

01:13:03.466 --> 01:13:05.685
to bless this sacred union

01:13:06.382 --> 01:13:08.558
and we pray

01:13:08.601 --> 01:13:12.866
that you may always find love
for each other in your heart.

01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:15.303
And that you may be safe
and protected

01:13:16.217 --> 01:13:17.654
as well as your family.

01:13:19.482 --> 01:13:20.483
Aho.

01:13:32.582 --> 01:13:34.192
[Tyler] We are gathered
here today

01:13:34.235 --> 01:13:37.587
to witness the marriage
of Davenport and Diana.

01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:39.676
But before we begin,

01:13:39.719 --> 01:13:41.678
Davenport would like
to say a few words.

01:13:46.596 --> 01:13:48.598
[Davenport] A hand, please.

01:13:48.641 --> 01:13:49.642
Thank you.

01:13:50.774 --> 01:13:51.862
[Davenport grunts]

01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:53.429
I got it.

01:13:55.126 --> 01:13:56.257
Oh, boy.

01:14:00.174 --> 01:14:02.612
Always kinda freaked me,
this close to the edge,

01:14:02.655 --> 01:14:03.830
I don't know.

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:07.443
[exhales]

01:14:09.662 --> 01:14:12.099
I guess I should
thank you all for coming.

01:14:14.058 --> 01:14:16.582
Before we really get started

01:14:16.626 --> 01:14:18.454
and anything
more formal than this.

01:14:18.497 --> 01:14:21.413
I thought that I might, uh...

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:24.242
tell you a couple of things
that I've been sitting on

01:14:24.285 --> 01:14:27.114
and kept to myself
for a long time.

01:14:27.158 --> 01:14:29.900
I know Diana
has told you all that, uh,

01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:32.380
Delia is my daughter.

01:14:33.686 --> 01:14:35.601
Well, uh...

01:14:37.951 --> 01:14:39.300
She's not my daughter.

01:14:40.824 --> 01:14:43.261
I had a vasectomy

01:14:43.304 --> 01:14:47.047
after Roselyn died
so she can't be my daughter.

01:14:47.091 --> 01:14:49.615
And it's no disrespect
to you, Diana.

01:14:52.052 --> 01:14:56.230
It's just that after
my second wife died...

01:14:56.274 --> 01:15:01.627
I couldn't really bear to bring
another life on this earth.

01:15:03.368 --> 01:15:05.413
[clicks tongue]
And, uh, when I...

01:15:06.850 --> 01:15:10.549
slept with you those years ago,

01:15:10.593 --> 01:15:13.596
you were very sad
and very vulnerable.

01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:16.990
And I couldn't resist you.

01:15:19.210 --> 01:15:20.951
And I'm ashamed of that.

01:15:22.387 --> 01:15:25.564
But I'm also a man and, uh...

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.263
I always felt that you and Glenn

01:15:29.307 --> 01:15:31.788
had something going on
with each other and, uh,

01:15:32.745 --> 01:15:36.967
Delia's toes.
[laughs]

01:15:37.010 --> 01:15:39.883
And so I figured that
she was Glenn's child.

01:15:41.624 --> 01:15:44.409
And lately, uh, you know...

01:15:45.715 --> 01:15:47.238
have been thinking about...

01:15:48.761 --> 01:15:51.459
my life and, uh...

01:15:52.809 --> 01:15:54.027
what it's about.

01:15:54.071 --> 01:15:57.596
My finances, my legacy.

01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.598
God, that's a terrible word.
I hate that word.

01:15:59.642 --> 01:16:02.993
But it's fact.

01:16:03.036 --> 01:16:04.124
I am vain.

01:16:05.256 --> 01:16:06.518
And my family.

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:11.088
And that's why
I brought you all here together,

01:16:11.131 --> 01:16:13.786
um, back to the compound
if you will.

01:16:14.831 --> 01:16:16.920
And, um...
[exhales]

01:16:18.182 --> 01:16:19.575
The last day or so,

01:16:19.618 --> 01:16:22.360
Tyler and I have been holed up
in a room over there

01:16:22.403 --> 01:16:25.842
because I had Tyler and Kent
who I enlisted

01:16:25.885 --> 01:16:28.888
put surveillance materials
all around the house

01:16:28.932 --> 01:16:31.456
and in the automobiles.

01:16:31.499 --> 01:16:33.414
Tyler and I have been
holed up over there

01:16:33.458 --> 01:16:35.634
watching all of your, uh,

01:16:35.678 --> 01:16:39.072
-behavior and emotions and, uh,
-Jesus Christ.

01:16:39.116 --> 01:16:43.642
just in reactions
and it was nice to see.

01:16:43.686 --> 01:16:46.123
And it's amusing
and interesting.

01:16:47.428 --> 01:16:48.516
[exhales]

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:52.259
And sometimes it's been
very touching.

01:16:53.086 --> 01:16:54.261
But sad.

01:16:56.655 --> 01:16:57.874
I enlisted Kent

01:16:57.917 --> 01:17:00.659
because he's always had
no vested interests

01:17:00.703 --> 01:17:03.357
in any of my finances or wealth

01:17:03.401 --> 01:17:05.969
or where it should go
or his part in it or anything.

01:17:06.012 --> 01:17:07.710
So you can understand
why I put him

01:17:07.753 --> 01:17:09.059
in the room with all of you.

01:17:10.147 --> 01:17:11.844
So he could bear witness

01:17:12.715 --> 01:17:14.760
to the eulogies,

01:17:14.804 --> 01:17:18.634
to the sincerity,
to the honesty.

01:17:18.677 --> 01:17:22.681
And in a couple of cases
real heart felt honesty...

01:17:24.378 --> 01:17:25.641
and sincerity.

01:17:27.425 --> 01:17:32.386
But throughout the weekend
there has been a sense of...

01:17:34.258 --> 01:17:35.999
"What's in it for me?"

01:17:39.306 --> 01:17:41.134
A sense of entitlement.

01:17:43.136 --> 01:17:44.616
That disturbed me.

01:17:46.052 --> 01:17:48.228
I can honestly say
that I feel that

01:17:48.272 --> 01:17:51.710
I've been able look
into the hearts

01:17:51.754 --> 01:17:54.278
and minds,
and in two or three cases

01:17:54.321 --> 01:17:56.062
the souls

01:17:56.106 --> 01:17:57.760
of each and every one of you.

01:18:00.327 --> 01:18:02.634
And I can say that, uh,

01:18:03.548 --> 01:18:06.986
I'm goddamn sure where we stand.

01:18:09.815 --> 01:18:10.816
Tyler.

01:18:15.995 --> 01:18:18.650
[Glenn] I think he's a manipulative-punitive patriarch.

01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:19.999
[Tom] I've been kissing
Davenport's ass

01:18:20.043 --> 01:18:21.740
for 20 years.
I'd like a little piece.

01:18:21.784 --> 01:18:23.307
[Diana] You wanted to have sex
with your daughter.

01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:24.961
[Regan] Rory, say you love me.

01:18:25.004 --> 01:18:27.528
[Delia] My mom has
a thing for you.

01:18:27.572 --> 01:18:30.140
[Diana] And if my best option
is marrying an old man,

01:18:30.183 --> 01:18:31.968
then fuck me
that's what I'm gonna do.

01:18:32.011 --> 01:18:34.884
[Tom] No, it's a... it's a...
it's an autonomous franchise!

01:18:36.668 --> 01:18:39.540
[laughing]

01:18:39.584 --> 01:18:40.716
[Tom] Not fucking funny.

01:18:40.759 --> 01:18:42.369
Dad, can I just ask
you a question?

01:18:42.413 --> 01:18:44.502
So the heart attack,
there was no heart attack.

01:18:44.545 --> 01:18:45.721
That was all bullshit?

01:18:45.764 --> 01:18:48.506
Yeah. You got a problem
with that?

01:18:48.549 --> 01:18:50.290
[Glenn] No. Just that
our own brother helped rig it.

01:18:50.334 --> 01:18:51.596
I made it up.

01:18:51.639 --> 01:18:52.858
[Kent] Wait a second,
I was at the hospital

01:18:52.902 --> 01:18:54.207
with you last night
and you were connected

01:18:54.251 --> 01:18:55.556
to a whole bunch of wires
and tubes, I mean...

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:56.775
-[Davenport] Rigged.
-I thought you were dying.

01:18:56.819 --> 01:18:58.211
Why... why would you fake

01:18:58.255 --> 01:18:59.691
-something like that?
-You went as far as rigging

01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:00.823
-that you were in a hospital?
-Guys, I'm sorry, okay?

01:19:00.866 --> 01:19:02.215
I didn't know
that he was going to

01:19:02.259 --> 01:19:03.826
-take it this far.
-What the fuck?

01:19:03.869 --> 01:19:05.958
Were you in the fucking scam
or were you half in on the scam.

01:19:06.002 --> 01:19:07.220
-I don't get it then.
-Oh, my god.

01:19:07.264 --> 01:19:07.960
I didn't know about...

01:19:10.223 --> 01:19:10.920
What about the wedding?

01:19:10.963 --> 01:19:13.226
What about the wedding?

01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:16.316
[Diana] Was there ever
gonna be a wedding?

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:19.798
After all we've learned about
each other this entire weekend.

01:19:20.843 --> 01:19:22.192
The going back and forth.

01:19:22.235 --> 01:19:24.368
The inner twining. The emotions.

01:19:24.411 --> 01:19:26.326
You still think
there should be a wedding?

01:19:27.632 --> 01:19:29.068
You're a bastard.

01:19:29.112 --> 01:19:31.331
No. Technically speaking,

01:19:31.375 --> 01:19:35.292
Kent, the son
is the only bastard in the area.

01:19:38.121 --> 01:19:39.122
[clears throat]

01:19:39.992 --> 01:19:41.167
[sighs]

01:19:41.211 --> 01:19:42.212
Thank you.

01:19:48.087 --> 01:19:49.132
[grunts]

01:19:50.655 --> 01:19:52.526
How could you use me like that?

01:19:54.267 --> 01:19:55.965
Excuse me?

01:19:56.008 --> 01:19:57.836
Madam, who are you talking to?

01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:01.318
You can't even make up your mind
between Glenn and Rory.

01:20:02.188 --> 01:20:04.234
What do you mean use you?

01:20:04.277 --> 01:20:05.409
What are you doing?

01:20:07.150 --> 01:20:08.194
Huh?

01:20:08.238 --> 01:20:09.587
[Diana] I have a daughter.

01:20:09.630 --> 01:20:10.849
Not by me.

01:20:12.459 --> 01:20:14.157
You have a grandchild.

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.855
I'll love her accordingly.
She understands that.

01:20:21.077 --> 01:20:22.687
See.
[clears throat]

01:20:22.730 --> 01:20:25.516
That's where
you're wrong, old man.

01:20:25.559 --> 01:20:27.692
Who does this
to the people he loves?

01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:31.348
I second my mom.

01:20:34.133 --> 01:20:36.135
I don't want anything
to do with you.

01:20:36.179 --> 01:20:38.616
'Cause I don't want anything
to do with a man

01:20:38.659 --> 01:20:40.183
who treats his family like this.

01:20:41.619 --> 01:20:44.013
You're an unbelievable
asshole Davenport.

01:20:45.318 --> 01:20:46.493
Really?

01:20:47.755 --> 01:20:48.844
Come on.

01:20:49.627 --> 01:20:50.846
You know what?

01:20:53.587 --> 01:20:55.328
I want to say I was sorry.

01:20:56.764 --> 01:20:59.071
-I'll pray for you.
-Thank you, ma'am.

01:20:59.115 --> 01:21:00.464
I don't need prayers.

01:21:01.204 --> 01:21:02.205
Than you.

01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:05.861
Um, well.

01:21:05.904 --> 01:21:07.253
[grunts]

01:21:08.211 --> 01:21:09.429
Here we are.

01:21:10.648 --> 01:21:11.649
[grunts]

01:21:19.918 --> 01:21:20.963
You're the puzzle.

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:23.791
You know why?

01:21:23.835 --> 01:21:26.098
You're a whiz kid business man.

01:21:27.230 --> 01:21:29.841
A financial probably genius.

01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:31.887
I don't know
what genius really means.

01:21:33.671 --> 01:21:35.803
And so you should be
the perfect person

01:21:35.847 --> 01:21:37.022
to run my steak.

01:21:38.937 --> 01:21:41.026
But you got a problem, boy.

01:21:42.506 --> 01:21:45.596
You don't like architecture.

01:21:48.033 --> 01:21:49.556
Not to mention you keep

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:51.602
referring to him
as the bastard son.

01:21:53.038 --> 01:21:54.387
Even though he, uh...

01:21:55.606 --> 01:21:57.825
takes part in this...

01:21:57.869 --> 01:22:01.568
insensitive and outrageous plan
of yours.

01:22:01.612 --> 01:22:04.136
Only to see you fake death
in a fucking hospital bed.

01:22:06.399 --> 01:22:07.966
You're the bastard Davenport.

01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:11.230
I may be a bastard...

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:17.541
but the fact
is you are a bastard.

01:22:19.282 --> 01:22:23.982
You know what, I'm tired
of being part of this charade.

01:22:24.026 --> 01:22:26.767
So goodbye Davenport.
It was... It was a great visit.

01:22:27.725 --> 01:22:29.379
And I am sorry to all of you

01:22:29.422 --> 01:22:31.163
because I didn't realize
he was gonna go this far

01:22:31.207 --> 01:22:33.557
and none of you deserve this.

01:22:36.081 --> 01:22:37.343
I feel terrible.

01:22:39.563 --> 01:22:41.957
[retreating footsteps]

01:22:45.656 --> 01:22:47.179
Davenport, look,
I hope you know that--

01:22:47.223 --> 01:22:48.833
[Davenport] Hey.

01:22:48.876 --> 01:22:50.008
You're done here.

01:22:51.053 --> 01:22:52.402
Get out of my sight.

01:22:55.187 --> 01:22:56.188
Now.

01:22:57.059 --> 01:22:58.712
Tell your story walking.

01:23:00.497 --> 01:23:01.585
Okay.

01:23:02.586 --> 01:23:04.457
-I want a divorce.
-Good.

01:23:12.857 --> 01:23:14.032
You know what?

01:23:16.861 --> 01:23:18.689
You can break my heart.

01:23:21.518 --> 01:23:24.869
You're the only one
who breaks my heart.

01:23:26.392 --> 01:23:27.654
You broke ours.

01:23:29.308 --> 01:23:30.788
You broke our hearts.

01:23:34.139 --> 01:23:35.184
[sighs]

01:23:36.402 --> 01:23:38.796
I'm fucked.

01:23:38.839 --> 01:23:40.885
Don't expect me to work
for this company anymore.

01:23:40.928 --> 01:23:43.105
I'm done. I'm so done, Dad.

01:23:44.758 --> 01:23:45.977
That's the word.

01:23:46.021 --> 01:23:47.805
If you go

01:23:47.848 --> 01:23:49.981
don't ever forget that word.

01:23:50.547 --> 01:23:51.548
Dad.

01:23:55.334 --> 01:23:56.335
[Davenport sighs]

01:23:58.120 --> 01:23:59.208
[Regan sniffles]

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:02.080
I hope you enjoyed this.

01:24:07.390 --> 01:24:08.695
Regan, wait up.

01:24:15.441 --> 01:24:16.573
[Glenn] Bravo.

01:24:18.792 --> 01:24:20.055
Nice work, Davenport.

01:24:21.404 --> 01:24:23.058
You're leaving too?

01:24:23.101 --> 01:24:24.450
[Glenn] I have a flight
in the morning.

01:24:28.150 --> 01:24:29.673
You should know,
you booked it, right?

01:24:29.716 --> 01:24:31.762
[Davenport] That's right,
I booked it.

01:24:31.805 --> 01:24:34.373
You still want
something from me?

01:24:34.417 --> 01:24:37.159
Why, because I'm the last man
standing, is that it?

01:24:37.202 --> 01:24:39.465
Maybe. You know why?

01:24:40.814 --> 01:24:42.207
'Cause you got game.

01:24:42.947 --> 01:24:44.340
You got a shot.

01:24:45.689 --> 01:24:48.083
If you fuck it up,
you're an asshole.

01:24:51.129 --> 01:24:52.435
You can keep the kingdom.

01:24:55.351 --> 01:24:57.092
May you reign
for a thousand years.

01:25:01.008 --> 01:25:03.272
[retreating footsteps]

01:25:15.675 --> 01:25:16.676
[sighs]

01:25:20.724 --> 01:25:21.855
Gone.

01:25:24.293 --> 01:25:25.511
Gone!

01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:29.863
[somber music]

01:26:02.418 --> 01:26:04.507
[clapping]

01:26:21.001 --> 01:26:22.002
[door opens]

01:26:32.056 --> 01:26:33.188
Can I get a ride?

01:26:35.668 --> 01:26:36.887
Where you going?

01:26:36.930 --> 01:26:37.931
[chuckles]

01:26:39.629 --> 01:26:40.891
i don't know.

01:26:48.812 --> 01:26:50.117
I just wanna go with you.

01:27:01.999 --> 01:27:03.087
i love you.

01:27:15.186 --> 01:27:16.883
[engine starts]

01:27:38.078 --> 01:27:39.515
[Glenn] Now, I've done
some revising

01:27:39.558 --> 01:27:41.386
and I think if we cut
some of the design flourishes

01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:42.996
and stick to the original plan,

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:44.781
we'll still be able to come in
under budget, which is nice.

01:27:44.824 --> 01:27:45.956
So what do you guys think?

01:27:46.739 --> 01:27:47.871
I like it.

01:27:47.914 --> 01:27:49.612
What do you think, hun?

01:27:49.655 --> 01:27:52.658
But it's not as creative
as the last plan was, but...

01:27:53.616 --> 01:27:55.661
Yeah, well, maybe it's, uh,

01:27:55.705 --> 01:27:58.882
just a little more practical,
you know.

01:27:58.925 --> 01:28:01.101
You never wanna let
the architecture get in the way

01:28:01.145 --> 01:28:02.451
of the functionality.

01:28:02.494 --> 01:28:04.017
-I agree.
-Yeah.

01:28:05.758 --> 01:28:07.151
I'm glad you guys like it.

01:28:07.934 --> 01:28:08.935
Sold.

01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:12.983
[foreboding music]

01:28:18.597 --> 01:28:20.295
[Amelia] Sir, if I can begin
by saying I know

01:28:20.338 --> 01:28:21.818
that SOM, they are angry

01:28:21.861 --> 01:28:23.123
-and it... it's my
-[Kent] Amelia, please take

01:28:23.167 --> 01:28:24.386
-fault. Please...
-a seat.

01:28:24.429 --> 01:28:25.952
-I can make this right.
-Please.

01:28:25.996 --> 01:28:27.302
Please, take a seat.

01:28:32.829 --> 01:28:35.135
Um, in my defense, sir,

01:28:35.179 --> 01:28:36.572
I've been loyal

01:28:36.615 --> 01:28:37.660
-without mistake for...
-Tell me something, Amelia.

01:28:37.703 --> 01:28:38.835
How was your weekend?

01:28:42.621 --> 01:28:45.494
-My weekend, sir? I...
-Yeah.

01:28:45.537 --> 01:28:46.886
Listen, we're just gonna...

01:28:48.845 --> 01:28:50.412
We're just gonna
start over, okay?

01:28:54.981 --> 01:28:56.548
Okay, Mr. Lear.

01:28:56.592 --> 01:28:57.854
Oh, no.
[chuckles]

01:28:57.897 --> 01:28:59.290
Please call me Kent.

01:29:01.423 --> 01:29:04.339
Well I've been with Lear
and Partners for 20 years so,

01:29:04.382 --> 01:29:05.949
I'd say that most
of my experience has been

01:29:05.992 --> 01:29:08.778
with projects
on an international scale.

01:29:08.821 --> 01:29:10.519
[man] Well, why'd you leave
that company?

01:29:11.694 --> 01:29:13.913
Well, I, uh...

01:29:13.957 --> 01:29:16.481
I wanted to try
and build something on my own.

01:29:16.525 --> 01:29:19.658
Even if it meant starting
with something a little smaller.

01:29:20.964 --> 01:29:22.531
[man] What makes you so sure
you're qualified

01:29:22.574 --> 01:29:23.836
to renovate my basement?

01:29:28.014 --> 01:29:29.015
[sighs]

01:29:36.458 --> 01:29:39.112
[Delia] I'm doing rounds
of the local architecture firms

01:29:39.156 --> 01:29:41.114
to see if anyone
could use an assistant.

01:29:43.552 --> 01:29:45.510
[Glenn] Well, what kind
of job experience do you have?

01:29:46.598 --> 01:29:47.860
The job's not for me.

01:29:47.904 --> 01:29:50.385
I'm just helping
with the search.

01:29:50.428 --> 01:29:52.648
It's for a woman
whose got a lot of experience

01:29:52.691 --> 01:29:54.998
working for a big shot LA firm.

01:29:56.303 --> 01:29:58.175
Does she still work there?

01:29:58.218 --> 01:29:59.829
-[Delia] No.
-[door opens]

01:30:03.789 --> 01:30:05.574
-Hey.
-[Glenn] Hi!

01:30:05.617 --> 01:30:08.533
Um, figured I needed a change.

01:30:13.886 --> 01:30:16.454
I would love that.
I would really love that.

01:30:20.066 --> 01:30:23.069
[light music]

01:30:32.078 --> 01:30:34.080
[waves crash]

01:30:34.124 --> 01:30:37.083
I hope you don't think
I'm an awful father.

01:30:37.127 --> 01:30:38.520
Well, you don't pay me
to offer up

01:30:38.563 --> 01:30:40.783
my personal opinions.

01:30:40.826 --> 01:30:43.438
You sure as hell offer them up
though, don't you?

01:30:43.481 --> 01:30:45.135
[chuckles]
From time to time.

01:30:47.006 --> 01:30:50.793
Just had to stop waiting
until I die.

01:30:52.708 --> 01:30:54.536
One of the problems
with having...

01:30:56.233 --> 01:30:57.887
a successful...
[coughs]

01:30:57.930 --> 01:31:02.587
career, is that sometimes
you raise children

01:31:02.631 --> 01:31:06.939
that never want to take
responsibility for themselves.

01:31:06.983 --> 01:31:08.463
-[Tyler chuckles]
-And...

01:31:09.028 --> 01:31:10.726
When I...

01:31:10.769 --> 01:31:13.032
When they were saying
all those things,

01:31:14.077 --> 01:31:15.470
it broke my heart.

01:31:17.341 --> 01:31:19.386
It broke my fucking heart.

01:31:20.170 --> 01:31:22.215
[coughing]

01:31:22.259 --> 01:31:23.303
[Tyler] You all right?

01:31:25.131 --> 01:31:27.482
-[sighs]
-So what are we gonna do now?

01:31:28.395 --> 01:31:29.440
Well, I got...

01:31:30.702 --> 01:31:33.444
one more thing to do
before I die.

01:31:33.488 --> 01:31:34.750
What are you talking about?

01:31:35.751 --> 01:31:36.839
I want you to...

01:31:37.796 --> 01:31:39.494
-[grunts]
-What's this?

01:31:39.537 --> 01:31:40.712
Be the...

01:31:41.670 --> 01:31:45.238
trustee over my assets

01:31:46.109 --> 01:31:47.632
for five years.

01:31:49.199 --> 01:31:51.418
And when that time is done...

01:31:53.943 --> 01:31:55.945
Forgive me, I just gotta rest.

01:31:55.988 --> 01:31:57.686
-It's all right.
-When it's done

01:31:57.729 --> 01:32:00.297
just make sure...

01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:04.257
that you divide it evenly
among all them equally.

01:32:05.432 --> 01:32:07.522
And that, uh, would include

01:32:08.392 --> 01:32:09.436
Tom...

01:32:10.612 --> 01:32:11.656
Diana...

01:32:12.788 --> 01:32:14.659
my granddaughter Delia.

01:32:15.791 --> 01:32:16.835
[sighs]

01:32:18.228 --> 01:32:19.664
[grunts]

01:32:19.708 --> 01:32:21.927
And after that time delay...

01:32:21.971 --> 01:32:23.233
[coughing]

01:32:24.713 --> 01:32:26.976
-You all right?
-Excuse me for coughing

01:32:27.019 --> 01:32:28.847
in your face, oh.

01:32:28.891 --> 01:32:31.850
That will have been able
to get their lives on track.

01:32:33.025 --> 01:32:35.593
And maybe they'll resist

01:32:35.637 --> 01:32:39.423
somehow the lifestyle
of the easy money.

01:32:39.466 --> 01:32:43.253
Well, that actually seems
remarkably wise, sir.

01:32:46.691 --> 01:32:48.301
Why didn't we just
do this before?

01:32:49.085 --> 01:32:50.739
Son. Come on.

01:32:51.348 --> 01:32:53.698
I'm an old fool.

01:32:53.742 --> 01:32:57.267
Jesus Christ,
don't be so severe on me.

01:32:59.704 --> 01:33:02.054
[Tyler] So what
are you gonna do now?

01:33:02.098 --> 01:33:04.709
I got a specialist that says...

01:33:05.928 --> 01:33:09.279
I got about a year and...

01:33:09.322 --> 01:33:13.631
I just don't see myself
spending all that time

01:33:13.675 --> 01:33:15.241
hooked up to a bunch of

01:33:16.852 --> 01:33:18.244
tubes and...

01:33:19.942 --> 01:33:23.249
uh, drooling in a bucket
while people are...

01:33:24.990 --> 01:33:29.038
starring at me over my crib
feeling sorry for me.

01:33:30.996 --> 01:33:32.476
Sir, you're really dying?

01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:35.522
We're all gonna die, Tyler.

01:33:36.741 --> 01:33:39.788
Every goddamn one of us
is gonna die.

01:33:39.831 --> 01:33:41.659
Trust me.

01:33:41.703 --> 01:33:44.096
It's just that sometimes
we get lucky.

01:33:45.271 --> 01:33:48.710
You get to choose
where and when.

01:33:49.885 --> 01:33:51.756
And I chose today.

01:33:52.496 --> 01:33:53.671
[Tyler] What?

01:33:53.715 --> 01:33:55.325
[Davenport] I mean, this far...

01:33:57.109 --> 01:33:58.458
[Tyler] What are you
talking about?
