00:22.433 --> 00:24.373
Thank you.

00:27.367 --> 00:28.797
Vettu cake?

00:28.833 --> 00:31.173
Deep fried balls
of deliciousness.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.800
Or a heart attack
waiting to happen,

00:32.833 --> 00:35.603
- depending on your world view.
- And capacity for joy.

00:35.633 --> 00:38.673
Never had a sweet tooth.
That's why I stay so slim.

00:38.700 --> 00:40.430
I am amazed
you have any teeth left at all

00:40.467 --> 00:42.197
when the temptation
to knock them out

00:42.233 --> 00:43.803
is so frequently overwhelming.

00:43.833 --> 00:46.473
Stealing toilet paper again,
Dr Walker?

00:46.500 --> 00:48.700
Just medical supplies for
my outreach programme.

00:48.733 --> 00:49.773
What outreach programme?

00:49.800 --> 00:52.370
Aid To Plantation
have asked for a mobile clinic.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.030
I left the paperwork
on your desk.

00:54.067 --> 00:56.367
You should have told me
in person. It's impossible.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.200
You've got clinics here,
visits booked.

00:58.233 --> 01:01.633
But it's been arranged.
They're expecting me.

01:01.667 --> 01:04.227
- Who's covering your shifts?
- I am.

01:04.266 --> 01:05.467
Not any more, you aren't.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.330
- What?
- Take him with you.

01:07.367 --> 01:08.527
I'll look after things here.

01:08.567 --> 01:10.297
- No, no, no.
- You're joking, right?

01:10.333 --> 01:12.773
It takes two to run a clinic
with any degree of efficiency.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.170
Really, I can handle this one
on my own.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.370
For once I actually agree
with Dr Walker.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.330
Bon voyage.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.100
What's the matter?

02:00.133 --> 02:02.273
You still haven't told me
where we're going.

02:02.300 --> 02:04.030
North... Ish.

02:04.067 --> 02:05.167
OK.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.130
Where exactly are we going?

02:11.667 --> 02:13.197
Here.

02:13.233 --> 02:15.073
The next state?

02:15.100 --> 02:16.230
Is it?

02:16.267 --> 02:18.797
Then, yeah.

02:18.833 --> 02:20.533
Five hours in a car with you...

02:20.567 --> 02:22.797
Yippee!

03:09.067 --> 03:10.797
The kite festival.

03:10.833 --> 03:12.003
Hey, is that today?

03:12.033 --> 03:15.503
You know, when I was your age
I used to smash lightbulbs

03:15.533 --> 03:17.133
and stick the glass
to the strings

03:17.167 --> 03:19.827
for maximum competitive edge.

03:19.867 --> 03:23.267
Excuse our orderly.
He has chronic verbal diarrhoea.

03:23.300 --> 03:25.170
Terminal if he's not careful.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.400
Mummy-ji... Mummy-ji, please.
Please.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.430
Can I help you?

03:38.500 --> 03:40.430
I was stung by a bee.

03:41.367 --> 03:43.297
It got infected.

03:50.667 --> 03:53.227
Except bees can't sustain
campaigns of violence.

03:53.267 --> 03:56.267
They sting once
and then they die.

03:56.300 --> 03:59.130
Men on the other hand
are more difficult to stop...

04:00.867 --> 04:02.667
AJ, would you look after
this young man

04:02.700 --> 04:04.500
whilst I have a quick word
with his mum?

04:04.533 --> 04:06.473
This way, please.

04:11.267 --> 04:13.827
Could you hold her hair
out of the way, please?

04:13.867 --> 04:15.797
Thank you.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.329
May I?

04:30.233 --> 04:32.703
Is there anything
you want to tell us?

04:32.733 --> 04:36.103
I told you already,
it's just a bee sting.

04:36.133 --> 04:38.033
I understand
you don't want to talk to us,

04:38.067 --> 04:40.467
- but perhaps I could organ...
- Please.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.430
Don't call the police.

04:44.167 --> 04:45.727
OK, Sister.
Wash and dress the wound

04:45.767 --> 04:47.827
and let's start her
on a course of antibiotics.

04:47.867 --> 04:49.427
Yes, Doctor.

04:52.067 --> 04:53.997
It's OK. You'll be fine.

04:58.600 --> 05:01.070
I think we must report this
to the authorities.

05:01.100 --> 05:02.770
Or we could castrate the bastard

05:02.800 --> 05:05.670
and feed his balls
to a marauding tiger.

05:05.700 --> 05:07.070
It makes my blood boil.

05:07.100 --> 05:08.770
Honest to God,
it takes everything in me

05:08.800 --> 05:12.070
not to throttle the little shit.

05:12.100 --> 05:16.530
Do you have a plan more in line
with accepted good practice?

05:16.567 --> 05:19.197
We could always refer her
to a specialist clinic

05:19.233 --> 05:21.073
trained to deal with
vulnerable women.

05:21.100 --> 05:23.700
Which are mostly committed to
saving the marriage and family

05:23.733 --> 05:25.503
no matter what.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.533
- Well, I don't think we have...
- Third fade.

05:27.567 --> 05:29.497
- Nose down.
- Fly out.

05:30.600 --> 05:31.530
Hey!

05:31.567 --> 05:34.767
Now that is
a perfectly executed flic flac.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.230
AJ!

05:36.267 --> 05:38.427
Stop fooling about
and get back to work.

05:40.100 --> 05:41.700
Well, not everybody
can appreciate

05:41.733 --> 05:44.133
the beauty of
airborne acrobatics.

05:52.633 --> 05:54.573
Krish.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.670
I know the doctors
are very good here.

05:58.700 --> 06:00.630
Your mum is going to be fine,
OK?

06:01.667 --> 06:04.127
Promise?

06:04.167 --> 06:07.167
Well, it's Makar Sankranti.

06:07.200 --> 06:11.070
Which means today all good
citizens let go of past sadness

06:11.100 --> 06:13.230
and embrace new beginnings.

06:13.267 --> 06:16.127
So basically it's a chance to
put all the bad stuff behind us

06:16.167 --> 06:18.097
and start again.

06:31.133 --> 06:33.203
Did you know leaf pickers
in the tea industry

06:33.233 --> 06:34.333
are nearly all women

06:34.367 --> 06:37.397
and are paid the lowest
wage of any sector in the state?

06:37.433 --> 06:39.703
And they've been without
any kind of medical care

06:39.733 --> 06:41.303
for over two years.

06:41.333 --> 06:43.203
I'm glad I packed
for a guilt trip.

06:43.233 --> 06:45.273
Why did they call you?

06:45.300 --> 06:47.600
Someone saw my picture
in the paper and got in touch.

06:47.633 --> 06:49.673
Now it all makes sense.

06:49.700 --> 06:53.130
I'm in the presence
of an angel of mercy.

06:53.167 --> 06:55.797
- They asked for help.
- Come on, admit it.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.503
You've dragged me out here
on a whim

06:57.533 --> 06:58.703
so you can play Lady Bountiful.

06:58.733 --> 07:01.803
Look, there was no dragging
involved. And you know that.

07:01.833 --> 07:04.533
I know it amuses you to cast
me as the cultural interloper

07:04.567 --> 07:06.497
but actually you're wrong.

07:54.367 --> 07:56.197
Hello.

07:56.233 --> 07:58.733
Hi, erm...I'm here from
the Good Karma Hospital.

07:58.767 --> 08:00.327
Sorry, we're a little early.

08:00.367 --> 08:02.767
This is Dr Varma
and I'm Dr Walker.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.070
- You're the doctors?
- Yes.

08:04.100 --> 08:06.770
Come with me, I'll show you
where the workers' quarters are.

08:06.800 --> 08:09.300
- Is it far?
- It's better if we drive.

08:09.333 --> 08:11.533
Sure. Erm...why don't
you get in the front?

09:36.067 --> 09:38.697
"Do not disturb."
Can't you bloody read?

09:38.733 --> 09:40.673
Paul. It's me, Greg.

09:42.167 --> 09:45.127
Come on. Open the door!

09:45.167 --> 09:49.527
Morning.

09:49.567 --> 09:51.367
I've been trying
to call you all day.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.330
Wait till you see this.

09:55.667 --> 09:58.327
Ta-dah!

09:58.367 --> 10:00.197
It's Makar Sankranti.

10:00.233 --> 10:03.403
The day that marks the sun's
passage into Capricorn.

10:03.433 --> 10:04.833
The Kite Festival?

10:04.867 --> 10:07.427
Wasn't that one of the things
Maggie wanted to do?

10:07.467 --> 10:10.127
Right. Yeah.

10:10.167 --> 10:11.397
Maybe another time.

10:11.433 --> 10:15.533
But the sun embarks on the
tenth part of its orbit today

10:15.567 --> 10:19.567
and Enki the sea goat is eager
to impart new knowledge.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.570
Come on.
It's a kite festival.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.700
Not obscure dance theatre.

10:25.233 --> 10:27.103
I'm sorry, mate.

10:27.133 --> 10:28.303
Have you got company?

10:28.333 --> 10:30.703
What? No. Don't be daft.

10:30.733 --> 10:33.173
It was Maggie's favourite.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.470
Sea goat, you say?

10:34.500 --> 10:37.130
- Yeah.
- I'll need a shower first.

11:18.333 --> 11:20.033
There's more abdominal symptoms.

11:20.067 --> 11:22.027
And half of them
seem badly malnourished.

11:22.067 --> 11:23.567
Probably occupational.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.300
Also the use of pesticides
without protective clothing

11:26.333 --> 11:28.733
can cause respiratory problems.

11:28.767 --> 11:30.427
This is hard work.

11:30.467 --> 11:32.167
But you knew that, right?

11:32.200 --> 11:33.430
Yeah.

11:33.467 --> 11:34.727
Last few.

11:34.767 --> 11:37.497
Don't forget we need to put the
tents up before it gets dark.

11:37.533 --> 11:38.833
There's no need.

11:38.867 --> 11:41.397
Didn't I tell you?
Accommodation's provided.

11:42.367 --> 11:43.997
Next.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.500
Hi.

11:56.533 --> 11:58.403
You're already here?
My apologies.

11:58.433 --> 11:59.803
And you've brought a friend?

11:59.833 --> 12:02.273
- Er...
- Colleague.

12:02.300 --> 12:03.830
I'm Dr Gabriel Varma.

12:03.867 --> 12:06.467
Kabir Nambeesan.
So nice to meet you.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.230
I'm so happy to see you.

12:08.267 --> 12:09.727
Everybody's
very eager to meet you.

12:09.767 --> 12:11.067
They're dying to meet you.

12:11.100 --> 12:12.570
There's so many places
to show you.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.430
So many things to tell you.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.467
I'm really excited.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.530
Do you two know each other?

12:18.567 --> 12:19.827
Yeah. Didn't she tell you?

12:19.867 --> 12:21.797
I'm Ruby's uncle.

12:24.467 --> 12:26.027
So happy to see you.

12:26.067 --> 12:27.697
You too.

12:27.733 --> 12:30.573
Have you eaten? Did you
eat something on the way?

12:30.600 --> 12:33.430
- Food?
- There is good food. Come.

12:33.467 --> 12:35.497
Dr Varma, please.

12:37.300 --> 12:39.100
Come, come, come.

12:39.133 --> 12:41.473
Doesn't look broken but we
should send him for an X-ray.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.430
Yes, Doctor.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.797
Good afternoon, Doctor.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.670
Will you excuse me for...
just one minute?

13:00.667 --> 13:03.327
I thought we agreed
not to call the police.

13:03.367 --> 13:07.267
- My domestic violence patient?
- I haven't called anybody.

13:07.300 --> 13:10.270
So why is there a uniformed
police officer with her?

13:10.300 --> 13:13.800
Gifted surgeon, yes.
Clairvoyant, not so much.

13:13.833 --> 13:16.673
Perhaps she decided
to make a statement after all?

13:19.433 --> 13:21.373
Wait.

13:27.467 --> 13:29.197
Where's she gone?

13:29.233 --> 13:31.173
She was here a minute ago.

13:33.867 --> 13:36.027
Dad, please, Dad.

13:36.067 --> 13:37.667
- Dad.
- Neelam!

13:38.567 --> 13:39.797
Neelam...

13:39.833 --> 13:42.673
He's her husband.

13:42.700 --> 13:43.830
Let them go.

13:50.833 --> 13:52.773
Shit.

14:09.333 --> 14:11.173
There she blows.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.330
Smooth and steady.

14:12.367 --> 14:13.827
The world is a jungle, baby.

14:13.867 --> 14:16.067
Hear me roar!

14:24.633 --> 14:26.033
Talking of tigers...

14:26.067 --> 14:27.597
Look,
I think I'm being stalked.

14:27.633 --> 14:29.103
Lydia.

14:29.133 --> 14:31.233
Oi, Lydia.
Look at my big cat.

14:32.133 --> 14:33.773
Not now.

14:35.867 --> 14:37.697
Isn't she a charm?

14:37.733 --> 14:38.903
Cats. Women.

14:38.933 --> 14:41.573
Think they'll do one thing.
Usually do something else.

14:41.600 --> 14:42.770
Too right, mate.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.100
Careful here.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.773
No. That could be
a tangle there.

14:47.767 --> 14:49.497
Watch it. Watch it. Careful.

14:49.533 --> 14:51.333
Argh!

14:56.600 --> 14:59.400
You soft sausage.

15:12.233 --> 15:14.173
What'd you do that for?

15:22.700 --> 15:24.630
Lydia, the kite...there it is.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.700
Neelam. You forgot these.

15:37.733 --> 15:39.403
It's very important
you take them.

15:39.433 --> 15:41.703
Three times a day
and complete the course.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.597
Speak out.

15:44.633 --> 15:46.273
Please.

15:46.300 --> 15:48.670
Before he does something worse.
And he will.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.130
Even if I could leave him,

15:52.167 --> 15:54.297
even if we had
somewhere else to go,

15:54.333 --> 15:55.773
he would find us.

15:55.800 --> 15:59.800
- Not if you went to a shelter.
- Prisons,

15:59.833 --> 16:03.373
where you're forced to live in
complete isolation, you mean?

16:04.400 --> 16:05.800
You could start again.

16:05.833 --> 16:08.003
Move to another part
of the country.

16:08.767 --> 16:10.727
My home is here.

16:10.767 --> 16:14.397
Home is somewhere
you should feel safe.

16:14.433 --> 16:16.403
Thank you for the antibiotics,
Dr Fonseca,

16:16.433 --> 16:18.433
and I appreciate your concern,

16:18.467 --> 16:21.097
but how I live my life
is up to me.

16:45.467 --> 16:47.827
Sugar?

16:47.867 --> 16:50.427
It's beautiful.

16:50.467 --> 16:53.597
Your grandmother
worked these bushes,

16:53.633 --> 16:57.033
as did her mother before her.

16:57.067 --> 16:59.997
Your whole family has lived here
for generations...

17:07.567 --> 17:09.426
Did my father live here too?

17:10.599 --> 17:13.369
Yes, of course.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.329
As a boy,
this is where he grew up.

17:16.666 --> 17:18.597
And where is he now?

17:20.733 --> 17:23.433
Doesn't stay in touch much now.

17:23.467 --> 17:26.097
He's a very,
very private person.

17:28.467 --> 17:30.397
That's one word for it.

17:32.767 --> 17:35.197
I prefer selfish.

17:35.233 --> 17:36.603
Irresponsible.

17:36.633 --> 17:38.703
Cowardly.

17:38.733 --> 17:40.603
Why else would he just
walk out on us both

17:40.633 --> 17:42.573
when I was just a baby?

17:49.600 --> 17:51.770
Our parents worked very hard,
you know.

17:53.333 --> 17:56.033
Worked every hour
of day and night to...

17:56.067 --> 17:58.297
to give him a good education,

17:58.333 --> 18:01.073
to send him abroad to study.

18:01.100 --> 18:03.200
He was supposed to
get a job there

18:03.233 --> 18:05.573
and send money back home.
That was the plan.

18:09.133 --> 18:11.073
That's not what happened.

18:11.867 --> 18:13.797
He met your mother.

18:16.133 --> 18:21.133
When our father died, when he
came back home for the funeral,

18:24.100 --> 18:29.170
that's when it really hit him,
how our mother had aged.

18:29.200 --> 18:32.700
I suppose he felt he couldn't
just leave her, you know,

18:32.733 --> 18:35.003
to deal
with all the creditors and...

18:37.133 --> 18:38.803
It was a very difficult time
for him.

18:38.833 --> 18:41.203
Difficult for him?

18:41.233 --> 18:43.673
He couldn't even manage
a card on my birthday.

18:47.067 --> 18:48.467
In his defence, all I can say,

18:48.500 --> 18:51.070
is that maybe his mind
was somewhere else...

18:51.100 --> 18:52.830
He had...responsibilities.

18:52.867 --> 18:56.427
Yes, to his wife and daughter.

19:05.167 --> 19:07.627
I'm sorry, OK.
On his behalf, I'm sorry.

19:10.167 --> 19:12.427
I'm sorry. It's been a long day.

19:12.467 --> 19:14.397
I'm going to turn in.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.627
Thank you for the tea.

19:45.567 --> 19:46.767
Are you OK?

19:46.800 --> 19:48.730
Please just leave me alone.

19:51.100 --> 19:53.300
- Look...
- I don't wanna talk.

19:53.333 --> 19:55.273
Please.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.500
Your mother was educated
and financially independent.

20:03.167 --> 20:05.267
So?

20:05.300 --> 20:06.730
She could survive by herself.

20:06.767 --> 20:09.797
She didn't have a choice.

20:09.833 --> 20:13.033
For a poor family in India,
with serious debt,

20:13.067 --> 20:14.597
it would be
a very different story.

20:14.633 --> 20:17.403
Of course. Of course you're
going to side with him.

20:17.433 --> 20:18.673
I'm not taking anyone's side.

20:18.700 --> 20:21.370
You still won't give me an inch,
will you?

20:21.400 --> 20:23.170
You have a chance
to build a relationship

20:23.200 --> 20:24.300
with an uncle who cares

20:24.333 --> 20:26.803
and instead you've come
to put your family on trial.

20:26.833 --> 20:29.033
Get out!

20:29.067 --> 20:31.097
- What?
- You heard me. Get out!

20:31.133 --> 20:34.273
Where am I supposed to go?

20:34.300 --> 20:36.670
You know everything.
Why don't you go figure it out?

20:38.667 --> 20:40.597
OK, OK.

21:09.767 --> 21:12.727
- Right. Pint of Sadlers?
- Not for me.

21:12.767 --> 21:14.097
Pork scratchings?

21:14.133 --> 21:15.573
He doesn't
have pork scratchings.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.130
I know.

21:17.167 --> 21:19.197
How are you doing, Paul?

21:19.233 --> 21:21.773
Come on. Stay.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.730
Toast the sea goat.

21:23.767 --> 21:25.297
It's a beautiful evening.

21:25.333 --> 21:27.173
You can't stay holed up
in that hotel room

21:27.200 --> 21:29.100
feeling sorry
for yourself forever.

21:29.133 --> 21:31.073
I can do what I like.

21:37.800 --> 21:41.830
Poor bugger doesn't know
what to do with himself.

21:41.867 --> 21:44.167
You've got to let him grieve
in his own way.

21:44.200 --> 21:47.230
Otherwise you'll end up pushing
him away when he needs you most.

21:47.267 --> 21:49.197
Well, thanks for the insight.

21:52.200 --> 21:53.800
Well, I'd better
get back to work.

21:53.833 --> 21:55.773
- Yeah.
- See you later.

24:02.700 --> 24:05.470
Third night on the trot,
isn't it?

24:05.500 --> 24:07.430
Said the pot to the kettle.

24:08.800 --> 24:11.770
- Proverbial idiom.
- Yes, I know.

24:11.800 --> 24:14.330
But I'm trying to avoid
an empty house.

24:14.367 --> 24:16.467
I'm not a natural workaholic.

24:20.600 --> 24:23.200
- Neelam!
- Help me. Please.

24:23.233 --> 24:25.373
It's OK, I've got you.

24:25.400 --> 24:27.170
It's OK, can you hear me?

24:27.200 --> 24:28.430
Are you in pain?

24:28.467 --> 24:30.797
We're going to examine you
now, Neelam.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.370
Where does it hurt?
Can you hear me?

24:35.400 --> 24:37.330
Where's all the blood
coming from?

24:39.100 --> 24:40.800
There's a small laceration
to her scalp.

24:40.833 --> 24:43.173
Fresh bruising to the neck.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.130
Doesn't explain all the blood.

24:45.167 --> 24:48.167
Check the monitor
and check her vitals.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.130
Unless the blood isn't yours...

24:57.067 --> 24:59.327
He's conscious.

24:59.367 --> 25:01.297
What happened to you,
Mr Saga?

25:04.567 --> 25:06.497
We had a disagreement.

25:08.833 --> 25:10.773
Obviously.

25:12.600 --> 25:14.830
I er...I hit him
with a cricket bat

25:14.867 --> 25:17.467
and he cracked his head
on the banister when he fell.

25:19.433 --> 25:21.503
Put a dressing on.

25:21.533 --> 25:23.473
- OK.
- Get on with it.

25:29.333 --> 25:30.673
OK, ready.

25:30.700 --> 25:32.630
One. Two. Three. Lift.

25:33.767 --> 25:34.867
He'll need a few stitches

25:34.900 --> 25:37.570
but I don't think there's
any serious damage done.

25:39.667 --> 25:41.427
Can I call you back?

25:41.467 --> 25:42.827
Krish?

25:42.867 --> 25:44.597
Are you hurt?

25:45.833 --> 25:47.533
- Mari?
- Yes, Doctor?

25:47.567 --> 25:49.467
- Go ahead. We'll catch you up.
- OK.

25:49.500 --> 25:50.800
You heard Dr Fonseca.
Come on.

25:52.600 --> 25:54.530
Krish.

25:58.167 --> 26:00.097
I did what you said.

26:02.800 --> 26:04.730
I killed the bee.

26:21.767 --> 26:24.297
- I'd like to talk about...
- I couldn't sleep last night,

26:24.333 --> 26:28.173
so I went through the list
of complaints again.

26:28.200 --> 26:30.700
I think there's an issue
with the water supply.

26:32.333 --> 26:34.203
Do you want to talk
about last night or...

26:34.233 --> 26:37.573
You know they pump water from
their local lake to this well?

26:39.167 --> 26:40.527
Yes.
That's where it's treated.

26:40.567 --> 26:42.227
Yeah.
Contaminated drinking water

26:42.267 --> 26:44.127
could explain
the wide range of symptoms.

26:44.167 --> 26:46.397
- It's possible.
- Unless you have a better idea?

26:46.433 --> 26:49.333
- No? Good.
- Hi.

26:49.367 --> 26:51.067
I hoped I would find you here.

26:51.100 --> 26:53.670
Er...if you could spare her
for an hour or two,

26:53.700 --> 26:56.200
I would like to take Dr Ruby
on a tour of the estate,

26:56.233 --> 26:57.303
show her the factory.

26:57.333 --> 27:00.733
Erm...I'd really love that,
but I have patients.

27:00.767 --> 27:04.097
But it won't take more than
an hour. I promise you.

27:04.133 --> 27:06.203
I'd really like to.

27:06.233 --> 27:07.633
I can't...

27:07.667 --> 27:09.597
- Really?
- Sorry.

27:12.267 --> 27:14.567
I can manage here...

27:14.600 --> 27:16.670
For an hour.

27:16.700 --> 27:18.630
See?

27:19.600 --> 27:22.300
Are you sure?

27:22.333 --> 27:24.733
You now have 59 minutes.

27:24.767 --> 27:26.427
Come on. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

27:26.467 --> 27:29.027
OK. Erm...thank you.

27:49.433 --> 27:51.073
Krish, go and get changed.

27:57.867 --> 28:01.367
The first time my husband hit
me, I was six months pregnant.

28:03.100 --> 28:06.630
I think he resented having
a rival for my affections.

28:06.667 --> 28:09.067
Someone who needed me
more than he did.

28:11.367 --> 28:14.067
But I forgave him. Because
I knew it stemmed from love.

28:14.100 --> 28:15.830
That's no excuse.

28:15.867 --> 28:17.427
Since then
I've been beaten weekly

28:17.467 --> 28:20.267
for the tiniest indiscretions.

28:20.300 --> 28:22.270
Leaving the house
without permission,

28:22.300 --> 28:25.670
not cooking the rice
to his satisfaction,

28:25.700 --> 28:27.630
imagined flirtations...

28:29.700 --> 28:33.270
My husband drinks away his wages
and I have never complained.

28:33.300 --> 28:35.230
Because I have
never had a choice.

28:36.500 --> 28:38.630
But if you report Krish,

28:38.667 --> 28:40.397
if you rob my son of his future,

28:40.433 --> 28:43.073
then my whole life
will have been in vain.

28:43.767 --> 28:45.697
Do you understand?

28:53.467 --> 28:55.667
The leaves are cut four times,

28:55.700 --> 28:58.600
and then oxidised for 40 minutes
in this machine

28:58.633 --> 29:02.173
and then they're dried
and filtered through here.

29:05.267 --> 29:08.667
Chai from God's own country.

29:08.700 --> 29:11.630
Medium-toned with a strong body,

29:11.667 --> 29:15.597
refreshing briskness
with just a hint of fruit.

29:17.633 --> 29:18.703
- See?
- Strong.

29:18.733 --> 29:20.303
Strong.

29:20.333 --> 29:22.273
I sound like a commercial
for tea.

29:23.267 --> 29:24.597
So silly.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.400
You know, when my mother
was too old to work the bushes,

29:31.433 --> 29:34.273
she persuaded the company
to set up a museum

29:34.300 --> 29:37.270
and she conducted
her own private tours.

29:37.300 --> 29:41.130
The tourists loved her.
Always smiling and joking.

29:41.167 --> 29:43.297
Very bad jokes.

29:43.333 --> 29:44.533
There she is there.

29:45.700 --> 29:49.170
She had a way of making
everyone she met feel special.

29:52.167 --> 29:54.097
- That's my grandmother?
- Yeah.

29:57.567 --> 29:59.597
I know if she was alive
to see you today,

29:59.633 --> 30:01.573
she would be really proud.

30:04.867 --> 30:06.527
That's my daughter, Barsha.

30:06.567 --> 30:08.197
She's the Treasurer here.

30:08.233 --> 30:10.773
Barsha, your cousin,
Dr Ruby Walker.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.730
Hi.

30:16.133 --> 30:18.573
So, when's the baby due?

30:18.600 --> 30:20.530
- April.
- April.

30:22.300 --> 30:24.570
Well, I can check you over
if you like?

30:24.600 --> 30:25.770
Or maybe an ultrasound?

30:25.800 --> 30:27.470
We have a portable unit
in the truck.

30:27.500 --> 30:29.330
No, thank you.

30:29.367 --> 30:32.097
- Barsha...
- It's... It's really simple.

30:32.133 --> 30:33.303
I could show you your baby.

30:33.333 --> 30:35.403
I would like that.
That would be really nice.

30:35.433 --> 30:37.333
Yeah, I'm very busy.

30:37.367 --> 30:39.297
Some other time.

30:41.233 --> 30:43.173
OK.

30:47.067 --> 30:49.427
I'm really sorry.

30:49.467 --> 30:50.567
It's OK.

30:50.600 --> 30:52.800
Usually she's not like this,
she's very friendly.

30:52.833 --> 30:55.803
But it's probably the hormones.

30:55.833 --> 30:58.103
Pregnancy can do
strange things to your mind.

30:58.133 --> 30:59.673
Yeah, yeah.

30:59.700 --> 31:03.200
I'm telling you that!

31:03.233 --> 31:05.573
You know, I should probably
get back to Dr Varma.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.130
Thank you
for showing me around.

31:09.167 --> 31:12.467
Listen, I wanted to ask you,
what are you doing later today?

31:12.500 --> 31:13.530
Not a lot.

31:13.567 --> 31:15.797
Er...do you want to come
to the bungalow for a bit?

31:15.833 --> 31:17.773
We're having
a small get-together.

31:17.800 --> 31:20.830
Just a few relatives
and friends.

31:20.867 --> 31:24.127
They've been cooking for days
and it would be nice if you...

31:24.167 --> 31:25.727
Get Dr Varma along
if you want.

31:25.767 --> 31:28.327
OK. Yeah, I... I'd love that.

31:28.367 --> 31:30.097
That'll be great.

31:30.133 --> 31:31.833
- So I'll see you later.
- Yeah. Thank you.

31:31.867 --> 31:33.797
- Great.
- Thank you.

31:45.067 --> 31:46.627
Bit early for that, in't it?

31:46.667 --> 31:49.327
Sun's over
the yardarm somewhere.

31:49.367 --> 31:51.267
Do you know how much
that cost me?

31:51.300 --> 31:54.770
That's why I normally frequent
less salubrious establishments.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.730
Yeah. That and the company.

31:58.467 --> 32:00.127
Are you here to apologise?

32:00.167 --> 32:02.067
Pff.

32:02.100 --> 32:05.300
Apology accepted.
Now go and play up your own end.

32:05.333 --> 32:06.673
Yeah, all right.

32:06.700 --> 32:07.800
Oi.

32:07.833 --> 32:09.773
Give me that beer.

32:28.467 --> 32:31.727
Maggie was reading this
when she died.

32:31.767 --> 32:33.827
Proper whodunit.

32:33.867 --> 32:35.567
Only I can't bring myself

32:35.600 --> 32:38.500
to read
beyond the page she bookmarked.

32:38.533 --> 32:42.773
Cos to go on without her feels
like a betrayal of some kind.

32:46.800 --> 32:48.200
I thought maybe it'd help

32:48.233 --> 32:50.333
doing all the stuff
we never had time for.

32:51.467 --> 32:54.767
Just makes me miss her more.

32:54.800 --> 32:57.030
When I'm on my own
I want to be with other people.

32:57.067 --> 32:59.567
When I'm with other people
I want to be on my own.

33:00.533 --> 33:02.103
I'm like that bird,

33:02.133 --> 33:05.173
flies around
in ever-decreasing circles

33:05.200 --> 33:07.330
till it disappears
up its own arse.

33:09.300 --> 33:11.500
Don't be that bird.

33:11.533 --> 33:13.433
It's mythical.

33:13.467 --> 33:15.397
Doesn't actually exist.

33:21.367 --> 33:23.297
Sometimes I wonder if I do.

33:41.533 --> 33:45.033
I checked a stool sample
and it's definitely bilharzia.

33:45.067 --> 33:47.297
I was waiting for someone from
the Tea Company to call me back

33:47.333 --> 33:49.833
so we can order
the praziquantel.

33:49.867 --> 33:52.327
It was a good spot.

33:52.367 --> 33:54.627
- Is that a compliment?
- A statement of fact.

33:54.667 --> 33:56.667
Do you even know
what a compliment is?

33:56.700 --> 33:58.030
Yes. Empty praise

33:58.067 --> 34:01.167
offered by insecure people
to please others.

34:02.167 --> 34:04.097
How was the grand tour?

34:05.200 --> 34:07.130
I'm glad I went.

34:09.567 --> 34:11.496
Thanks.

34:11.533 --> 34:14.603
Tea.

34:14.632 --> 34:17.473
You know I don't think I'm
a better person than you.

34:18.833 --> 34:21.803
OK.

34:21.833 --> 34:23.672
That was a compliment,
by the way.

34:23.699 --> 34:27.800
Thanks, er...
thanks for the clarification.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.496
And I... I guess I know a lot.

34:31.533 --> 34:33.803
But not everything.

34:33.833 --> 34:37.072
You seem to know
quite a lot too.

34:37.100 --> 34:39.530
Maybe even about some things
that I don't know.

34:40.733 --> 34:43.072
About tea, for example.

34:43.100 --> 34:45.400
Now that you
went on the tea tour.

34:48.467 --> 34:50.397
I'm trying to apologise here.

34:51.733 --> 34:52.803
Well, erm, promise me

34:52.833 --> 34:55.672
that you'll never try
and apologise ever again.

35:00.833 --> 35:03.033
My parents died
when I was very young.

35:05.367 --> 35:07.297
I still think about them
every day.

35:11.867 --> 35:15.227
I had no right to judge you
for wanting to come here.

35:21.500 --> 35:24.530
- This isn't necessary.
- Just go with it.

35:24.567 --> 35:26.497
And the other one.

35:27.433 --> 35:29.173
Good.

35:49.267 --> 35:52.027
Would this, erm,
would this be a weird time

35:52.067 --> 35:56.127
to ask if you want to
come to a party?

35:56.167 --> 35:59.727
They just want to say thanks,
so it's up at the bungalow.

35:59.767 --> 36:01.697
Yes, I'll come.

36:02.600 --> 36:04.330
OK. Cool.

36:04.367 --> 36:06.027
It's about 3 or 4pm, I think.

36:09.533 --> 36:12.133
If you want to.
I mean, it's no biggy.

36:12.167 --> 36:14.367
- Yes.
- Yeah, OK, good. Cool.

36:14.400 --> 36:17.700
I was thinking we could meet
later tonight at the festival...

36:17.733 --> 36:21.633
I could show you
my kite moves...

36:21.667 --> 36:24.067
OK. Very good.
Eight o'clock.

36:24.100 --> 36:25.800
Er...and not a moment later.

36:25.833 --> 36:28.033
Our patients need new sheets.

36:28.067 --> 36:30.597
AJ, when you've finished your
pretend call to the laundry,

36:30.633 --> 36:32.603
which closed at midday,

36:32.633 --> 36:34.833
could you take Neelam
and Krish to the waiting area

36:34.867 --> 36:37.267
and make sure they have
something to eat and drink?

36:37.300 --> 36:39.230
Go with him. You'll be fine.

36:46.767 --> 36:48.067
- Dr Nair?
- Yeah.

36:48.100 --> 36:49.370
- Do you have a moment?
- Yes.

36:49.400 --> 36:51.070
When we're done here,

36:51.100 --> 36:52.530
I think I might
phone a colleague

36:52.567 --> 36:54.227
and have my wife arrested.

36:54.267 --> 36:55.827
For attempted murder.

36:55.867 --> 36:58.127
And when she cites
a decade of domestic abuse,

36:58.167 --> 36:59.727
I'd like to see
how that pans out.

36:59.767 --> 37:03.427
My wife reads too much,
has an over-active imagination.

37:03.467 --> 37:06.527
You had her scalp in your hand.

37:06.567 --> 37:08.697
Occasionally things
get physical.

37:08.733 --> 37:11.803
We have a fiery relationship.

37:11.833 --> 37:14.403
But domestic abuse?
Come on now.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.303
I've scraped enough women
off the floor

37:16.333 --> 37:19.133
to know the difference.

37:19.167 --> 37:21.097
- Stitch him up.
- With pleasure.

37:23.700 --> 37:26.200
Sharp scratch.

37:38.433 --> 37:40.333
Sure, I'll try a little bit
of everything.

37:42.700 --> 37:44.630
It looks amazing.
Honestly.

37:46.533 --> 37:49.203
Thank you.

37:53.100 --> 37:54.100
Your Great-Auntie Pooja

37:54.133 --> 37:57.033
is asking if her dhal
is better than Abha's.

37:57.067 --> 37:58.767
Er...

37:58.800 --> 38:01.330
What's the correct answer?

38:01.367 --> 38:02.567
I can't tell you that.

38:02.600 --> 38:04.230
But I can tell you
that Auntie Pooja

38:04.267 --> 38:06.327
didn't speak to her husband
for two years

38:06.367 --> 38:08.427
after he criticised
her sambol,

38:08.467 --> 38:10.467
so I'll let you decide.

38:10.500 --> 38:12.370
Erm... The best.

38:21.200 --> 38:22.400
Hi.

38:22.433 --> 38:26.303
So are you, erm, my first cousin

38:26.333 --> 38:28.273
or my second cousin
once removed?

38:30.533 --> 38:32.433
This.

38:32.467 --> 38:33.627
OK, go ahead.

38:33.667 --> 38:35.597
Be careful with that. OK?

38:37.633 --> 38:39.103
Husband?

38:39.133 --> 38:42.033
No, no.
No. We're not married.

38:42.067 --> 38:44.097
He's very handsome.
Is he single?

38:44.133 --> 38:45.303
Yes.

38:45.333 --> 38:46.473
Single, I mean. Not...

38:48.700 --> 38:49.770
She says in that case

38:49.800 --> 38:52.570
you should leave him
in the hands of a real woman.

39:02.133 --> 39:05.173
Why do I get the feeling my day
is about to get even worse?

39:12.100 --> 39:13.830
I was talking to Paul.

39:13.867 --> 39:17.467
Says he can't imagine
a future without his wife.

39:17.500 --> 39:21.830
And when he told me that,
this afternoon,

39:21.867 --> 39:24.067
I kid you not,

39:24.100 --> 39:26.200
I had a sodding great lump
in my throat.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.670
You'd have
to have a heart of stone

39:30.700 --> 39:33.100
not to feel for the fella.

39:33.133 --> 39:35.673
I'm not really good
at handling stuff like that.

39:37.400 --> 39:39.330
So I knew
there had to be more to it.

39:41.367 --> 39:44.297
So I delved
into my innermost psyche,

39:45.733 --> 39:47.833
by which I mean
I downed three pints,

39:47.867 --> 39:52.197
watched women's volleyball
on Sky Sports

39:52.233 --> 39:53.373
and I realised...

39:54.367 --> 39:57.697
I realised...I was jealous.

40:00.367 --> 40:04.427
Because I know you'll never
feel lost without me.

40:13.300 --> 40:15.330
You're right.

40:15.367 --> 40:17.297
I don't need you.

40:20.067 --> 40:21.997
I don't need anyone.

40:23.233 --> 40:25.173
But I choose to be with you.

40:26.600 --> 40:28.530
Isn't that enough?

40:43.267 --> 40:44.667
Hey, buddy.

40:44.700 --> 40:47.170
Do you want me to show you
some new tricks?

40:47.200 --> 40:49.370
I can show you the axel
or the black hole?

40:50.367 --> 40:52.297
None of you understand, do you?

40:53.200 --> 40:55.030
Krish.

40:55.067 --> 40:56.997
Krish.

40:59.700 --> 41:01.400
Er...Krish.

41:01.433 --> 41:03.273
Guys.

41:03.300 --> 41:05.130
If you could just... One second.

41:05.167 --> 41:08.227
Dr Nair! Dr Fonseca!

41:08.267 --> 41:10.127
Excuse me, please,
you can't leave.

41:10.167 --> 41:11.497
Hey. Hey.

41:11.533 --> 41:13.173
Get off me. Get off me

41:13.200 --> 41:16.400
or I'll have you arrested
for assaulting a police officer.

41:16.833 --> 41:19.433
Dad.

41:19.467 --> 41:21.397
Get inside.

41:27.233 --> 41:29.573
Neelam.

41:29.600 --> 41:31.630
Thank you for your efforts,
Dr Fonseca,

41:31.667 --> 41:35.597
but I'm afraid you failed to
take one detail into account.

41:36.700 --> 41:38.630
And what's that?

41:39.833 --> 41:41.773
I love him.

42:33.400 --> 42:35.330
Dr Varma.

42:37.133 --> 42:39.073
Hold on a second.

42:47.367 --> 42:49.727
Dr Walker was right.

42:49.767 --> 42:51.697
These people need our help.

42:53.500 --> 42:55.430
I'll... I'll call you back.

42:55.467 --> 42:57.397
He's lying to her.

42:59.733 --> 43:01.233
Kabir is lying to Ruby?

43:01.267 --> 43:03.097
I told him it was a bad idea.

43:03.133 --> 43:04.233
It's not fair on her

43:04.267 --> 43:06.367
and I don't think I should be
the one to tell her.

43:06.400 --> 43:08.570
- Tell her what?
- She needs to talk to him.

43:08.600 --> 43:11.070
Ask him
why he really wants her here.

43:11.100 --> 43:13.330
Wait.
What are you talking about?

43:13.367 --> 43:15.297
Just tell her to talk to him.

44:02.133 --> 44:04.073
- Hey.
- Hey.

44:08.767 --> 44:11.797
Erm... I need to talk to you.

44:12.400 --> 44:13.530
OK.

44:13.567 --> 44:14.997
There's something
I need to...

44:25.733 --> 44:28.273
I'm sorry,
am I interrupting something?

44:29.700 --> 44:31.470
No, no, no. Not at all.

44:31.500 --> 44:33.130
Yes, you are.

44:33.167 --> 44:35.197
I got you some tea.

44:35.233 --> 44:37.733
Are you going to tell us
what's going on here?

44:37.767 --> 44:39.167
What are you doing?

44:39.200 --> 44:40.500
What's going on?

44:40.533 --> 44:42.673
He's been lying to you.

44:42.700 --> 44:44.630
What?

44:52.833 --> 44:56.173
What's going on?

44:56.200 --> 44:59.300
I thought if I told you the
truth, you wouldn't come here.

45:01.400 --> 45:03.330
Well, what truth?

45:04.733 --> 45:06.673
What do you know?

45:09.367 --> 45:11.297
Tell me!

45:14.633 --> 45:16.573
I'm your father, Ruby.

45:19.467 --> 45:20.797
What?

45:20.833 --> 45:22.773
I'm sorry.

45:28.267 --> 45:29.697
OK.
