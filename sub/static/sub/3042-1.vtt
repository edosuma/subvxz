00:57.173 --> 01:00.009
We have killed Babylonians!

01:02.804 --> 01:05.640
<i>We have killed Mesopotamians!</i>

01:07.684 --> 01:10.019
<i>We have killed Assyrians!</i>

01:10.186 --> 01:11.688
Mycenaeans!

01:11.979 --> 01:13.606
Sumerians!

01:14.232 --> 01:15.566
But...

01:17.568 --> 01:20.571
<i>...we have never had the pleasure...</i>

01:21.614 --> 01:23.282
<i>...of killing...</i>

01:24.325 --> 01:25.743
...an Akkadian.

01:32.625 --> 01:34.794
Which limb do I take first?

01:37.588 --> 01:39.924
May the gods have pity on you.

01:41.342 --> 01:44.679
Because my brother will not.

02:14.542 --> 02:15.543
Boo.

03:20.524 --> 03:21.859
You missed.

03:38.209 --> 03:40.544
You're lucky we have the same mother.

03:49.553 --> 03:54.433
<i>Before the time of the pyramids,
a fearsome horde came from the east...</i>

03:54.517 --> 03:58.104
<i>...and swept across the barren lands
of the ancient world.</i>

04:09.198 --> 04:13.911
<i>By the law of the horde, their
greatest warrior was proclaimed their king.</i>

04:18.165 --> 04:20.500
<i>His name was Memnon.</i>

04:22.128 --> 04:25.506
<i>He was the greatest swordsman
the world had ever seen.</i>

04:46.152 --> 04:51.157
<i>With the predictions of a sorcerer, who
could foretell the outcome of every battle...</i>

04:52.116 --> 04:54.785
<i>...Memnon slaughtered
all who resisted him...</i>

04:59.123 --> 05:02.334
<i>...until only a brave few remained.</i>

05:16.223 --> 05:17.099
Silence!

05:17.183 --> 05:19.685
My father has called for silence!

05:20.019 --> 05:22.354
Hold your tongues!

05:29.403 --> 05:34.074
We are gathered in this place
to put our differences aside.

05:34.450 --> 05:36.619
There is still time for us...

05:36.911 --> 05:39.079
<i>...the last of the free tribes...</i>

05:39.747 --> 05:42.875
...to stand together against this tyrant.

05:43.334 --> 05:46.003
With his sorcerer at his side...

05:46.420 --> 05:48.589
...no mortal can defeat Memnon.

05:48.714 --> 05:51.884
And, if the sorcerer were to die...

05:53.093 --> 05:54.261
<i>...what then?</i>

05:54.345 --> 05:57.264
It's too late for your schemes, Pheron.

05:57.973 --> 06:02.978
I have raided Memnon's caravans,
broken the supply lines to his troops...

06:03.187 --> 06:06.273
...but he still swept across
the land like a plague.

06:06.523 --> 06:10.819
I will not send my people to their deaths
in a battle that can't be won.

06:10.903 --> 06:13.906
And what people would that be, Balthazar?

06:14.740 --> 06:16.742
<i>You are the ruler of nothing...</i>

06:17.201 --> 06:19.036
<i>...but a pile of rocks...</i>

06:19.411 --> 06:20.746
...and sand.

06:22.873 --> 06:24.291
If I am no king...

06:26.877 --> 06:28.837
...why are you on your knees before me?

06:28.921 --> 06:30.714
Balthazar! Guards!

06:42.726 --> 06:46.480
Akkadians.
I thought they were wiped out long ago.

06:46.647 --> 06:49.066
They are the last of their kind.

06:49.149 --> 06:52.653
By their hand, the sorcerer will die.

06:53.070 --> 06:56.657
You put your faith in a clan of cutthroats
who kill for money?

06:56.782 --> 06:59.994
They are more than that.
They are skilled assassins...

07:00.202 --> 07:03.288
<i>...trained for generations
in the deadly arts.</i>

07:03.497 --> 07:08.002
What price do these mercenaries
ask from us, Father?

07:08.836 --> 07:10.671
Twenty blood rubies.

07:10.963 --> 07:12.923
That's the last of our treasury.

07:13.007 --> 07:14.341
Be quiet!

07:16.719 --> 07:20.723
If these men kill the sorcerer,
will you fight?

07:34.528 --> 07:35.863
So be it.

07:37.948 --> 07:40.325
As long as one of us still breathes...

07:41.994 --> 07:43.996
...the sorcerer will die.

07:48.625 --> 07:49.710
Assassin!

07:55.132 --> 07:56.508
Him...

07:56.800 --> 07:58.510
...we'll kill for free.

08:04.808 --> 08:07.895
We can reach
Memnon's encampment by nightfall.

08:09.146 --> 08:11.315
Why do you keep that filthy beast?

08:11.732 --> 08:13.901
He doesn't mean anything by it.

08:13.984 --> 08:15.444
Horses are faster.

08:15.611 --> 08:17.279
But camels are smarter.

09:05.285 --> 09:07.079
That one's mine.

09:07.621 --> 09:08.914
Live free.

09:10.666 --> 09:12.000
Die well.

09:14.670 --> 09:16.463
Stop! Listen to me!

09:16.547 --> 09:18.382
<i>I am a high priest of Set.</i>

09:18.632 --> 09:22.970
Spare me, and I shall bless thee
in five different languages.

09:23.553 --> 09:26.807
You will scream in five different languages,
horse thief!

09:26.890 --> 09:27.808
Wait!

09:52.499 --> 09:54.084
I'm not that heavy.

10:22.279 --> 10:24.906
Look out for the fat one! He's behind you!

10:31.663 --> 10:32.831
Help me!

10:32.956 --> 10:35.250
<i>Help me, whoever you are!</i>

10:36.001 --> 10:37.544
Thank you, good sir.

10:37.627 --> 10:38.628
Quiet.

10:38.754 --> 10:41.506
There's an enormous reward
for my safe return.

10:58.857 --> 11:00.692
The sorcerer's tent.

11:11.953 --> 11:13.205
Back!

11:28.929 --> 11:30.138
That way!

11:30.222 --> 11:32.182
Find the other one!

12:21.481 --> 12:23.650
You've been betrayed, Mathayus.

12:25.151 --> 12:26.653
You know my name?

12:27.362 --> 12:29.030
And why you're here.

12:37.455 --> 12:39.291
He's in the tent!

13:29.049 --> 13:31.384
A living, breathing Akkadian.

13:31.885 --> 13:34.054
<i>This is a rare pleasure.</i>

13:38.183 --> 13:41.019
I hear you train yourselves
to bear great pain.

13:41.227 --> 13:44.230
You must teach me this,
if you live long enough.

13:57.077 --> 14:00.580
Not looking so full of yourself,
are you now, assassin?

14:00.997 --> 14:02.373
You...

14:02.791 --> 14:05.418
Betrayed your own father!
Yes.

14:05.752 --> 14:07.837
He was very shocked.

14:08.088 --> 14:11.424
You could tell by the look on his face.

14:13.093 --> 14:14.719
<i>By my father's head...</i>

14:16.763 --> 14:18.556
...I pledge my allegiance.

14:18.848 --> 14:21.017
You have proven your loyalty, Takmet.

14:21.101 --> 14:23.144
This one still lives.

14:38.201 --> 14:39.327
Beautiful.

14:42.747 --> 14:44.249
<i>Bring him to me.</i>

14:51.506 --> 14:52.590
Mathayus.

14:55.969 --> 14:57.428
Live free.

15:01.140 --> 15:03.309
Die well, my brother.

15:11.651 --> 15:12.902
So...

15:14.445 --> 15:16.239
...how shall this one die?

15:16.322 --> 15:18.408
He shall not die tonight.

15:18.491 --> 15:19.576
Really?

15:20.910 --> 15:21.995
<i>We shall see.</i>

15:22.078 --> 15:24.289
Nor shall he die by your hand...

15:24.706 --> 15:26.791
...or any hand you command.

15:33.298 --> 15:35.174
You have seen this in a vision?

15:35.258 --> 15:38.928
To ignore this would bring great misfortune.

15:39.470 --> 15:42.140
<i>The gods show him favor on this night.</i>

15:42.348 --> 15:43.683
Just the gods?

15:50.356 --> 15:51.858
A puzzle, then:

15:53.067 --> 15:57.905
How to kill you without using my hand
or any hand I command.

16:20.219 --> 16:22.180
Fascinating, isn't it?

16:22.638 --> 16:26.476
This smoke, it causes the fire ants
to abandon their homes, you see?

16:33.900 --> 16:37.403
All the sooner to feast on our naked heads.

16:38.613 --> 16:40.990
- You think that's funny?
- It's a little bit funny.

16:41.074 --> 16:45.328
You see, I am about to escape.
You, on the other hand, will die horribly...

16:45.411 --> 16:47.080
...for leaving me to die last night!

16:47.163 --> 16:48.998
So, what are you waiting for?

16:49.082 --> 16:50.875
You see that one up there?

16:50.958 --> 16:55.004
<i>He's been drinking that yak piss for
an hour. And sometime very soon...</i>

16:55.755 --> 16:57.256
You see?

17:10.560 --> 17:12.939
Where's the horse thief?

17:41.300 --> 17:44.178
All right, come on,
get me out of here.

17:46.472 --> 17:47.807
Do you...

17:47.890 --> 17:49.642
...promise not to kill me?

17:50.434 --> 17:51.894
Yes, I promise.

17:51.978 --> 17:56.315
Remember, you are an Akkadian. You make
an oath, you always have to keep it.

17:57.066 --> 17:58.317
That's right.

17:58.818 --> 18:02.822
Promise to take me with you
and share in the spoils of your adventures.

18:03.990 --> 18:04.991
What?

18:05.199 --> 18:07.535
All right, fine. Yes, I promise.

18:28.347 --> 18:30.349
All right. Now, hold still.

18:30.933 --> 18:32.268
<i>Here's one.</i>

18:32.852 --> 18:34.270
<i>That's a big one!</i>

18:34.562 --> 18:36.355
My, here comes the mother!

18:38.107 --> 18:39.942
So, where are we going?

18:40.026 --> 18:43.613
To Memnon's kingdom
to avenge my brother's death.

18:47.700 --> 18:49.201
Never touch the bow.

18:49.285 --> 18:50.536
Not a problem.

18:52.371 --> 18:54.373
- Who are you calling?
- My ride.

19:02.048 --> 19:03.799
It's a nice camel.

19:07.303 --> 19:10.264
Not much room back here.
Scoot up, please.

19:12.224 --> 19:13.601
We had a deal!

19:13.726 --> 19:16.896
That's right. And I haven't killed you. Yet.

19:25.488 --> 19:28.074
What news from my sorceress today?

19:56.519 --> 19:57.978
What news?

19:58.854 --> 20:01.690
Your armies will conquer in the west.

20:01.941 --> 20:05.361
Queen Isis' forces will
scatter to the four winds.

20:10.241 --> 20:13.119
Give the generals the news.
Have them make their armies ready.

20:13.202 --> 20:14.787
Yes, my lord.

20:29.385 --> 20:31.220
You think I'm cruel, don't you?

20:31.303 --> 20:34.557
Perhaps you've forgotten
what it's like outside these walls.

20:34.640 --> 20:36.642
<i>Heartless, ignorant...</i>

20:36.976 --> 20:38.394
...and savage.

20:41.397 --> 20:43.315
But I can change that.

20:43.649 --> 20:46.652
<i>I will bring order after centuries of chaos.</i>

20:47.319 --> 20:49.864
<i>An order which will last for 1,000 years!</i>

20:53.951 --> 20:56.412
Rivers of blood can never bring peace.

20:56.495 --> 20:58.664
But they can bring obedience!

20:59.290 --> 21:01.292
<i>That will suffice for now.</i>

21:03.919 --> 21:06.589
<i>And when I become the king of legend...</i>

21:08.007 --> 21:12.511
...then you shall take your place beside me,
on a throne...

21:13.345 --> 21:15.014
<i>...and in my bed.</i>

21:16.181 --> 21:17.683
But, my lord...

21:18.809 --> 21:22.980
...in your bed,
I would lose my gift of sight.

21:24.064 --> 21:27.067
And you would lose your advantage in battle.

21:27.985 --> 21:32.489
The day I speak of
is the day I no longer need your vision.

21:40.915 --> 21:42.249
Gomorrah.

21:43.292 --> 21:48.213
After a hard day of looting and pillaging,
there is no greater city than Gomorrah.

21:48.839 --> 21:50.507
Except maybe Sodom.

21:53.969 --> 21:55.638
I wish I could join you.

21:55.804 --> 21:57.222
You're not going?

21:58.223 --> 22:03.062
Believe me, I'd like to even the score
with a few of those red guards myself.

22:03.604 --> 22:07.941
But with the price they have on my head,
I'd never make it through the gates.

22:09.234 --> 22:11.153
I have faith in you, my friend.

22:11.236 --> 22:12.738
You'll get us in.

22:31.298 --> 22:35.302
You see? They've got the city sealed up
tighter than a crab's buttocks.

22:35.427 --> 22:38.722
I wish there was something
I could do to help, but I...

22:39.098 --> 22:40.349
But there is.

22:46.313 --> 22:48.357
What business do you have here?

22:48.690 --> 22:50.692
I've come to collect a bounty.

22:52.277 --> 22:53.362
Horse thief.

22:53.445 --> 22:56.615
I know this dog.
They'll behead him for sure this time.

22:57.741 --> 23:00.077
He'll be all the prettier without it.

23:06.125 --> 23:09.294
- What happened?
- You got us in. I knew you could do it.

23:09.461 --> 23:12.631
A jug of your finest wine
for my road-weary friend here.

23:13.132 --> 23:16.885
Wait a minute.
The last thing that I remember was...

23:16.969 --> 23:19.721
...this huge Akkadian fist
coming straight into my...

23:19.805 --> 23:21.432
Here's your wine, sir.

23:22.015 --> 23:25.018
Let me know if there's
anything else you'd like.

23:26.645 --> 23:29.148
It's good to be back in the big city.

23:29.815 --> 23:31.442
Watch my camel for me.

23:31.650 --> 23:32.985
Gladly.

23:33.318 --> 23:35.320
Been working here long time?

23:36.530 --> 23:37.948
How's the kabob?

23:48.834 --> 23:53.714
Merchandise, the highest quality.
Steel forged by the monks of Pompeii.

23:53.797 --> 23:58.594
The world's finest swords. You can't get
respect in Gomorrah without a quality blade...

23:58.677 --> 24:03.348
Birds of paradise! Birds of prey!
The most beautiful birds in the world.

24:04.057 --> 24:07.060
Hey, soldier, those big
muscles look cramped.

24:07.186 --> 24:10.522
- Perhaps one of us can help you relax.
- Maybe all of us.

24:39.551 --> 24:41.720
Mister! Guide, mister!

24:41.970 --> 24:44.723
You need a guide to find
your way in Gomorrah.

24:47.392 --> 24:50.312
A good guide could show me
a way into Memnon's palace.

24:50.395 --> 24:55.400
But a smart guide wouldn't,
or he'd be shown into Memnon's dungeon.

25:10.832 --> 25:12.501
I don't have it!

26:14.604 --> 26:16.565
Do you want to earn this one?

26:28.326 --> 26:31.163
Get ready. I'll kill half, you kill half.

26:34.499 --> 26:36.835
All right. I'll kill them all.

26:37.169 --> 26:40.046
How about we go around them
and not kill anybody?

26:45.844 --> 26:48.180
Good Lord! Are you going to kill me?

26:48.680 --> 26:49.848
Maybe later.

26:50.182 --> 26:52.809
Memnon's always threatened to have my head.

26:53.351 --> 26:55.937
Don't touch that.
What is it?

26:56.521 --> 26:59.149
That's my special magic powder.

26:59.524 --> 27:01.193
Magic powder?

27:01.651 --> 27:06.656
Yeah, magic powder. It's from a Chinese
formula that I procured at great expense.

27:07.574 --> 27:11.912
If I get the recipe right,
it'll move mountains.

27:12.037 --> 27:14.372
Clear roadways in an instant.

27:14.539 --> 27:17.876
Do great things, wonderful things.

27:19.961 --> 27:21.796
Or terrible things.

27:25.383 --> 27:28.053
Like all my inventions,
Memnon will use it for war.

27:28.136 --> 27:29.512
Where is Memnon?

27:30.555 --> 27:32.515
You mean to kill him, do you?

27:34.809 --> 27:35.769
Yes.

27:36.561 --> 27:39.981
In that case,
I'd say he was in the training courtyard.

28:53.888 --> 28:55.890
No! Let me go!

28:58.393 --> 29:00.061
<i>I didn't do anything!</i>

29:04.816 --> 29:06.985
You know the penalty for thievery.

29:08.361 --> 29:09.404
No!

29:36.097 --> 29:37.432
No!

29:42.145 --> 29:43.938
Intruder!

30:03.541 --> 30:05.001
Follow me!

30:07.879 --> 30:09.005
You again.

30:09.172 --> 30:10.924
How do I get out of here?

30:11.549 --> 30:12.967
Through that door.

30:14.302 --> 30:15.470
What's that?

30:15.553 --> 30:17.472
That's one of my latest inventions.

30:17.555 --> 30:21.976
<i>It was meant to be a quick means of
transportation, but landing was a problem.</i>

30:23.269 --> 30:24.437
Open!

30:26.064 --> 30:26.856
<i>Open!</i>

30:26.940 --> 30:28.650
Don't touch that, you'll set it off.

30:28.733 --> 30:29.817
Right.

30:49.087 --> 30:50.421
A man.

30:51.214 --> 30:52.465
What is this place?

30:52.548 --> 30:56.177
Memnon's harem.
But he visits so rarely.

30:56.261 --> 30:58.596
And it gets so lonely.

31:02.517 --> 31:04.185
Can't you leave me alone, Thorak?

31:04.269 --> 31:06.062
Watch your tongue, Philos.

31:06.604 --> 31:09.524
Careful with those!
They're delicate instruments.

31:09.607 --> 31:12.944
You're lucky Lord Memnon
has a taste for your science...

31:13.278 --> 31:14.946
...you old fool!

31:17.865 --> 31:22.870
If I find out that you had anything to do
with this intruder, I will send the executioner.

31:25.873 --> 31:27.500
We know how to please.

31:28.418 --> 31:30.670
I'm sure you do, but...
Stay.

31:30.753 --> 31:33.798
Stay with us.
Now's not a good time.

31:33.881 --> 31:36.884
We will make your every fantasy come true.

32:08.207 --> 32:09.542
Kill him!

32:29.228 --> 32:30.688
After him!

32:46.829 --> 32:48.164
Go get him!

33:19.445 --> 33:22.532
Are you going to try to kill me
or just stare at me?

33:28.829 --> 33:29.956
Ow!

33:33.209 --> 33:34.710
Take a breath.

33:59.318 --> 34:00.903
Gods be praised!

34:05.741 --> 34:07.910
How dare you touch me?

34:12.248 --> 34:15.583
Sorceress, I am an Akkadian,
hired to kill you.

34:16.085 --> 34:19.672
I find myself in the position
where you are more use to me alive.

34:19.755 --> 34:21.757
Don't make me change my mind.

34:24.927 --> 34:29.931
And he said, "It's not the size of the hump,
it is the motion of the camel. "

34:39.275 --> 34:41.944
Alas, I must leave you now.

34:48.117 --> 34:49.659
There's the traitor!

34:49.869 --> 34:51.704
Great gods.

35:03.841 --> 35:08.179
He's dead!
Just admit it, you smelly camel.

35:09.972 --> 35:12.641
I am your master now! You belong to me!

35:12.975 --> 35:14.977
He is dead! Dead!

35:15.311 --> 35:16.479
Dead!

35:18.397 --> 35:21.067
You are alive! I knew it!

35:21.317 --> 35:22.651
Right.

35:23.652 --> 35:25.738
I was just saying to the camel:

35:25.821 --> 35:28.949
"Camel, no one could kill
our good friend Mathayus. "

35:29.784 --> 35:30.785
Get on.

35:30.868 --> 35:34.163
Why should I make it easy for you?
You're sworn to kill me.

35:34.246 --> 35:35.873
Others will die first.

35:38.501 --> 35:39.919
That's comforting.

35:41.796 --> 35:43.464
Who's your friend?

35:43.589 --> 35:45.049
Memnon's sorcerer.

35:45.758 --> 35:48.928
Memnon's sorcerer? Are you insane?

35:49.094 --> 35:50.971
She's going to get us all killed!

35:51.055 --> 35:54.183
Memnon must leave
the safety of his palace to get her.

35:54.266 --> 35:58.854
So you're going to use me first,
and then kill me. I feel so much better.

35:59.188 --> 36:02.316
I could do it the other way around
and kill you first.

36:02.525 --> 36:04.193
Where are we going?

36:05.277 --> 36:06.946
The Valley of the Dead.

36:07.029 --> 36:08.531
The Valley of the Dead?

36:08.614 --> 36:13.452
Nobody goes to the Valley of the Dead!
That's why they call it the Valley of the Dead!

36:14.703 --> 36:16.247
Wait for me, please!

36:25.548 --> 36:30.386
Take a dozen of your best men,
track him down, kill him...

36:32.263 --> 36:34.181
...and bring her back to me.

36:35.641 --> 36:37.643
Send me news when he's dead.

36:38.561 --> 36:40.145
Yes, my lord.

36:40.229 --> 36:41.689
My lord...

36:42.648 --> 36:46.151
...there are rumors spreading to the armies
that she is gone.

36:48.737 --> 36:49.822
Is this true?

36:49.905 --> 36:52.074
- It is, my lord.
- Then silence them.

36:52.741 --> 36:56.412
They must believe she is here,
if only for a short time.

37:03.085 --> 37:05.254
And when you find the Akkadian...

37:13.095 --> 37:14.847
...give him this from me.

37:20.102 --> 37:22.438
Are we where I think we are?

37:23.856 --> 37:24.857
Yes.

37:27.443 --> 37:28.610
Home.

38:11.570 --> 38:13.614
Where are you going, sorceress?

38:24.374 --> 38:25.918
In a hurry to get back to Memnon?

38:26.001 --> 38:29.129
No, to get away from you!
I'll never go back to Memnon!

38:29.505 --> 38:32.174
He's kept me prisoner since I was a child.

38:37.596 --> 38:40.224
Why did you help me that night in the tent?

38:42.643 --> 38:45.813
I knew you were the one man
who could help me escape.

38:56.240 --> 38:59.868
Run, if you like. But there are
worse dangers out there than me.

39:19.513 --> 39:21.723
What? You can't find it?

39:22.558 --> 39:23.892
It's around here somewhere.

39:23.976 --> 39:25.477
What are you looking for?

39:25.561 --> 39:27.896
Just a place to get out of the storm.

39:28.897 --> 39:30.399
What storm?

39:30.732 --> 39:32.317
You'll see.

39:41.410 --> 39:42.828
Thorak.

39:43.829 --> 39:45.664
Memnon didn't come, did he?

39:46.081 --> 39:47.958
He sent his maggots to do his work.

39:48.041 --> 39:49.960
He's smarter than you think.

39:51.044 --> 39:52.713
Or more cowardly.

39:53.422 --> 39:55.382
Can I go home now?

39:59.303 --> 40:00.470
Stay here.

40:01.388 --> 40:02.848
Cover up.

40:02.931 --> 40:04.266
You'll be safe.

40:29.791 --> 40:31.918
He's attacking. Alone?

40:32.002 --> 40:34.171
The sun has fried his brain.

40:34.421 --> 40:37.257
1,000 duranas to the one
who brings me his head!

41:23.261 --> 41:25.013
Akkadian bastard!

41:27.891 --> 41:29.392
<i>Where is he?</i>

41:41.279 --> 41:42.614
<i>This way!</i>

41:47.244 --> 41:48.912
<i>You two first!</i>

42:32.080 --> 42:33.874
Stay on the stones!

43:30.013 --> 43:31.514
Come with me.

44:04.381 --> 44:05.799
Don't touch that.

44:37.539 --> 44:38.832
Coward!

44:40.250 --> 44:42.252
Show your face!

45:28.298 --> 45:29.632
The Akkadian.

45:39.642 --> 45:41.269
Mathayus!

46:17.805 --> 46:22.060
You are alive! You swatted them
like flies! You are invincible!

46:49.962 --> 46:52.382
Tell me, do you think you can save him?

46:54.300 --> 46:55.760
His fever's high.

46:56.260 --> 46:59.764
<i>The poison was made with scorpion venom.
If he does live...</i>

46:59.889 --> 47:03.559
...the blood of the scorpion
will always flow through his veins.

47:43.808 --> 47:45.226
Sorceress?

47:57.238 --> 47:58.906
It is a miracle.

48:00.408 --> 48:03.744
She cured you. I knew it! I felt her magic!

48:05.538 --> 48:09.542
<i>It almost killed her.
But, the gods, they were on our side.</i>

48:14.881 --> 48:18.718
Why? Why would you risk your life
to save mine?

48:19.802 --> 48:22.388
Because I believe you can save the people.

48:22.555 --> 48:24.557
The people are not my problem.

48:24.974 --> 48:26.309
Memnon is.

48:27.393 --> 48:30.062
You and the people have the same problem.

48:57.924 --> 49:00.885
Pardon, my lord. A message from Thorak.

49:04.096 --> 49:06.098
Finally, the Akkadian is dead.

49:12.939 --> 49:14.774
Something wrong, my lord?

49:16.275 --> 49:17.610
Not at all.

49:18.861 --> 49:20.571
Everything is in order.

49:21.155 --> 49:23.658
<i>In fact, things are going so well...</i>

49:24.116 --> 49:26.285
...that I'm moving up our plans.

49:27.286 --> 49:30.957
Tomorrow night, we feast
to celebrate our impending victory.

49:31.248 --> 49:34.835
And then we'll drive the last of the rebels
into the sea.

49:35.044 --> 49:36.379
<i>Now go.</i>

49:38.839 --> 49:40.257
My lord.

49:41.050 --> 49:44.804
It is customary for the sorceress
to be present at these meetings.

49:45.388 --> 49:47.181
Why is she not here today?

49:47.306 --> 49:48.724
She is indisposed.

49:48.891 --> 49:50.893
It is nothing serious, I hope.

49:51.310 --> 49:53.229
If it were serious...

49:53.312 --> 49:55.398
...then you would know about it.

49:56.982 --> 49:58.317
Now go!

50:04.031 --> 50:05.366
She is alive.

50:05.825 --> 50:08.327
She is with him and he is coming here.

50:08.828 --> 50:10.162
Get ready.

50:23.384 --> 50:26.178
It works!

50:27.847 --> 50:32.351
<i>My lady, how lovely to see you out here
in this desolate place.</i>

50:32.685 --> 50:34.687
Let me show you. It works!

50:35.354 --> 50:37.356
<i>Come, come, come.</i>

50:37.857 --> 50:39.442
<i>My lady sorceress.</i>

50:42.862 --> 50:44.238
<i>You see?</i>

50:44.530 --> 50:46.031
I worked it out.

50:46.699 --> 50:50.202
My Chinese formula. My magic powder works!

50:50.536 --> 50:53.205
<i>All I needed was salt, petered salt.</i>

50:53.706 --> 50:57.042
It was here all the time.
This place is just full of it.

50:57.376 --> 51:00.379
By the way,
do any of you happen to have any water?

51:09.054 --> 51:11.223
What do you think,
it is safe to drink?

51:14.226 --> 51:15.311
Not anymore.

51:15.394 --> 51:18.981
Delicious. You see, the sandstone must act
as a natural filter.

51:19.315 --> 51:20.316
Quiet.

51:27.239 --> 51:29.742
I'm alive! I'm alive!

51:33.412 --> 51:34.955
For the moment.

51:58.062 --> 51:59.230
Mathayus!

52:01.023 --> 52:02.191
Move.

52:15.579 --> 52:16.664
Assassin!

52:17.748 --> 52:19.500
<i>The gods are good to me.</i>

52:19.875 --> 52:24.880
When we last met, you offered to kill me.
Now I have a chance to return the favor.

52:25.297 --> 52:27.049
You are trespassers here.

52:27.216 --> 52:30.719
<i>Our survival depends
on this place being kept a secret.</i>

52:31.345 --> 52:34.640
So we have a problem,
as long as you're alive.

52:34.723 --> 52:37.309
No problem.
I can keep a secret like no other.

52:37.393 --> 52:40.688
In fact, I cannot remember how we got here.
We took a left turn...

52:40.771 --> 52:43.983
It's too late for that.
Balthazar!

52:44.733 --> 52:48.570
This place is sanctuary
for all of Memnon's enemies. You know that.

52:48.779 --> 52:51.740
- This man is dangerous!
- Your judgment is clouded.

52:51.824 --> 52:54.493
My judgment keeps all of you alive!

52:54.743 --> 52:57.413
This man cannot be
trusted and I'll prove it.

52:57.997 --> 52:59.623
Bring the woman to me!

53:04.128 --> 53:07.339
The first man to touch her
will have to come through me.

53:14.847 --> 53:17.349
I had hoped for nothing less.

54:29.046 --> 54:30.547
That's not fair!

54:51.443 --> 54:52.444
Get him!

54:57.991 --> 54:59.034
Go!

55:07.834 --> 55:08.877
Yeah!

55:15.425 --> 55:16.885
Do you yield?

55:16.969 --> 55:19.388
- Never!
- Then you're a fool.

55:19.846 --> 55:23.100
We're brothers in the same cause.
Brothers?

55:23.183 --> 55:27.187
You brought death to my people.
Memnon will follow you.

55:27.562 --> 55:29.815
He will come for his sorceress.

55:30.440 --> 55:33.193
<i>Yes, I know who she is.</i>

55:33.485 --> 55:35.737
Memnon will stop at nothing
to see her return.

55:35.821 --> 55:40.826
He'll come swifter and deadlier once
he has her. Memnon will stop at nothing.

55:41.285 --> 55:44.955
Hide here as long as you can,
but believe me when I say he'll find you.

55:45.038 --> 55:49.626
And if he isn't stopped, he'll sweep
across this land and kill all of you.

55:52.254 --> 55:54.589
And who's going to stop him, Akkadian?

55:54.673 --> 55:55.632
You?

55:56.258 --> 55:59.302
Will you stand alone
before the fury of his armies?

56:03.265 --> 56:04.182
Yes.

56:25.120 --> 56:29.291
A gentleman always lets a lady win.
Best two out of three?

56:31.126 --> 56:32.461
Dates?

56:33.170 --> 56:34.838
Thank you.

57:22.177 --> 57:24.179
<i>Cassandra!</i>

57:58.588 --> 58:00.090
I've had a vision.

58:01.383 --> 58:05.554
Memnon will follow me here
and destroy these people.

58:06.137 --> 58:07.472
You know this?

58:16.398 --> 58:18.233
The things I see...

58:18.566 --> 58:20.819
...are like shimmers in a pond.

58:22.070 --> 58:26.074
Some are certain and some remain shadows.

58:26.950 --> 58:28.618
<i>But I do know this:</i>

58:29.327 --> 58:33.331
Memnon will release his armies
and ride straight through this place.

58:33.790 --> 58:36.042
Memnon will die by my hand.

58:43.341 --> 58:46.052
It seems the gods favor
me tonight, Akkadian.

59:03.278 --> 59:05.113
If you face Memnon...

59:06.364 --> 59:07.699
...you'll die.

59:10.368 --> 59:12.203
That is your destiny.

59:17.542 --> 59:19.544
I make my own destiny.

01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:11.888
I need your help.

01:00:54.055 --> 01:00:56.391
Where do you think you're
going with my horse?

01:00:56.474 --> 01:00:57.433
To Gomorrah.

01:00:57.517 --> 01:00:59.477
Nothing we say will stop him.

01:01:00.228 --> 01:01:01.854
Without your sorceress?

01:01:01.938 --> 01:01:06.818
She returned to save the lives of your people.
I won't let her face Memnon's wrath alone.

01:01:06.901 --> 01:01:07.902
Step aside.

01:01:07.986 --> 01:01:10.738
Akkadian, you are riding to your death.

01:01:11.406 --> 01:01:13.241
If I let you ride alone...

01:01:17.579 --> 01:01:20.248
...what glory will there be left for me?

01:01:51.154 --> 01:01:53.156
This night we celebrate.

01:01:54.365 --> 01:01:55.533
Eat...

01:01:56.034 --> 01:01:57.869
...and drink your fill...

01:01:58.536 --> 01:02:01.372
...for tomorrow we ride into battle.

01:02:07.003 --> 01:02:10.340
I would have captured him myself,
but he ran like a coward.

01:02:10.631 --> 01:02:12.800
He left his bow behind.

01:02:15.887 --> 01:02:17.221
My lord...

01:02:18.473 --> 01:02:21.184
...there is something
troubling our soldiers.

01:02:22.310 --> 01:02:23.811
How distressing.

01:02:24.562 --> 01:02:25.688
Pray tell.

01:02:27.065 --> 01:02:31.235
It's been said
the sorceress is no longer by your side.

01:02:33.154 --> 01:02:35.490
Soldiers will fall prey to...

01:02:36.491 --> 01:02:38.242
...idle palace gossip.

01:02:38.826 --> 01:02:41.496
<i>You have my word, she is perfectly safe.</i>

01:02:41.829 --> 01:02:44.499
If the men are to fight, to die...

01:02:45.333 --> 01:02:47.418
...they may need more than that.

01:02:50.171 --> 01:02:51.672
You doubt my word?

01:02:51.798 --> 01:02:53.466
It is not that, sire.

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:57.095
It's just she is a symbol
from which the men derive courage.

01:02:57.178 --> 01:02:59.514
Symbols are most effective when seen.

01:02:59.597 --> 01:03:00.765
My lord.

01:03:07.939 --> 01:03:09.941
I am here at your request.

01:03:11.067 --> 01:03:12.652
<i>Pardon my absence.</i>

01:03:13.402 --> 01:03:15.238
I was not well.

01:03:16.697 --> 01:03:20.451
But our impending
victory has lifted my spirit.

01:03:21.702 --> 01:03:24.205
Is this sufficient to placate your men?

01:03:26.707 --> 01:03:28.876
Tell them what you see, sorceress.

01:03:34.090 --> 01:03:35.925
I see a great victory.

01:03:38.219 --> 01:03:41.889
Your enemies will reveal themselves to you.

01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:52.275
Halt!

01:03:54.485 --> 01:03:55.987
What is in the cart?

01:03:56.404 --> 01:03:57.905
What is in the cart?

01:03:58.906 --> 01:04:02.076
<i>Actually, it is a bit of a surprise.</i>

01:04:04.078 --> 01:04:06.581
<i>A gift for tonight's festivities.</i>

01:04:06.998 --> 01:04:08.916
Prince Takmet's request.

01:04:10.418 --> 01:04:11.752
Very nice.

01:04:17.675 --> 01:04:18.843
Well, now.

01:04:19.302 --> 01:04:21.470
Let's see that pretty little face.

01:05:12.146 --> 01:05:13.981
Now go to my chambers.

01:05:14.482 --> 01:05:16.275
We have things to discuss.

01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:24.200
My sincerest apologies, my lord.

01:05:28.496 --> 01:05:30.164
I understand.

01:05:32.666 --> 01:05:35.503
You are fearful, weak.

01:05:42.343 --> 01:05:44.178
The feast is over.

01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:47.556
To bed, men, for tomorrow we conquer!

01:05:52.353 --> 01:05:54.063
Fortify the palace guard.

01:06:10.871 --> 01:06:13.040
All right, that was the easy part.

01:06:13.290 --> 01:06:15.793
- Everybody know what to do?
- Cripple the guards.

01:06:15.876 --> 01:06:17.253
Ignite the powder.

01:06:17.336 --> 01:06:19.130
And try not to get killed.

01:06:21.048 --> 01:06:23.134
What are you doing here? You could get hurt.

01:06:23.217 --> 01:06:24.510
So could you.

01:06:24.593 --> 01:06:26.053
Stay in the wagon.

01:06:27.721 --> 01:06:29.682
You watch yourself, Akkadian.

01:06:31.225 --> 01:06:33.060
No need for concern, miss.

01:06:33.144 --> 01:06:34.979
He's gonna pay for that.

01:06:43.237 --> 01:06:46.407
Seal the gates. Seal all the gates.

01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:55.249
Though I'm relieved to see you unharmed...

01:06:57.501 --> 01:07:00.004
...I am surprised the
Akkadian didn't kill you.

01:07:00.087 --> 01:07:02.590
He was after you. I was merely a pawn.

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:04.466
But you escaped his grasp.

01:07:04.550 --> 01:07:06.385
I'm not without my wiles.

01:07:08.053 --> 01:07:09.972
Yes, I'm well aware of that.

01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:11.515
<i>Bring them.</i>

01:07:18.105 --> 01:07:19.982
Tomorrow my victory is complete.

01:07:20.065 --> 01:07:23.569
That is your vision?
As I said, I have seen it.

01:07:24.028 --> 01:07:25.112
Have you?

01:07:27.615 --> 01:07:29.450
I sense a change in you.

01:07:29.950 --> 01:07:31.785
<i>You seem somehow...</i>

01:07:33.454 --> 01:07:34.705
...diminished.

01:07:35.122 --> 01:07:36.790
I assure you...

01:07:37.291 --> 01:07:38.876
...I am myself.

01:07:39.126 --> 01:07:40.294
Good.

01:07:40.961 --> 01:07:43.881
A small demonstration
shouldn't trouble you, then.

01:07:59.647 --> 01:08:00.981
A simple test.

01:08:40.562 --> 01:08:41.814
Now go.

01:08:42.356 --> 01:08:44.024
<i>Everyone leave!</i>

01:08:58.205 --> 01:09:00.707
Where am I going?
Stop.

01:09:01.207 --> 01:09:04.545
It's over there. It should be just there.

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:17.975
Good man.

01:09:52.426 --> 01:09:53.760
Well, well.

01:09:55.929 --> 01:09:57.431
<i>What have we here?</i>

01:10:08.984 --> 01:10:10.319
One at a time!

01:10:23.457 --> 01:10:25.959
Six urns. Four cobras.

01:10:26.376 --> 01:10:27.711
Now...

01:10:28.295 --> 01:10:30.297
...let's see what you can see.

01:11:02.871 --> 01:11:04.122
Excellent.

01:11:05.165 --> 01:11:07.000
<i>One empty pot left now.</i>

01:11:14.216 --> 01:11:15.717
Who dies first?

01:11:34.194 --> 01:11:35.821
We're almost there.

01:11:45.038 --> 01:11:46.581
You know what I see?

01:11:46.915 --> 01:11:48.250
Fear.

01:11:50.043 --> 01:11:52.212
You have lost your power.

01:11:53.255 --> 01:11:55.257
Thrown it all away.

01:12:12.190 --> 01:12:14.443
What magic is this?
Mine.

01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:18.113
I see your fate, hollow king.

01:12:19.239 --> 01:12:21.074
And its time has come.

01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:27.539
Do you wish to test magic against steel?

01:12:40.427 --> 01:12:43.597
I've come for the woman and your head.

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.809
The assassin and the sorceress.

01:12:48.435 --> 01:12:50.103
How romantic.

01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:53.356
I'll bury you both together!

01:13:51.623 --> 01:13:53.124
And here it is.

01:13:54.250 --> 01:13:55.835
The foundation stone.

01:14:21.736 --> 01:14:23.655
Hurry, we're running out of time.

01:14:23.738 --> 01:14:25.740
I'm hurrying! I'm hurrying!

01:14:58.481 --> 01:14:59.733
Fire in front.

01:15:00.066 --> 01:15:01.860
<i>Palace guard at your back.</i>

01:15:01.943 --> 01:15:04.654
Looks like I'll be keeping
my head after all.

01:15:17.834 --> 01:15:19.419
Kill the witch!

01:16:16.601 --> 01:16:18.019
Mathayus!

01:17:01.312 --> 01:17:03.147
For your father.

01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:04.041
Die well, assassin.

01:18:37.742 --> 01:18:40.453
It seems the gods favor
me tonight, Akkadian.

01:18:51.923 --> 01:18:53.758
Mathayus!

01:19:17.448 --> 01:19:21.702
Hurry up and light it.
You hurry up. This is your invention.

01:19:27.792 --> 01:19:29.126
Follow me.

01:20:11.502 --> 01:20:13.587
Ready! Weapons!

01:20:50.166 --> 01:20:51.500
Attack!

01:20:58.966 --> 01:21:01.135
So much for not getting killed.

01:21:08.309 --> 01:21:09.643
Catch this.

01:22:19.213 --> 01:22:20.631
Hail to the king!

01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:25.386
I knew it from the start.

01:22:25.469 --> 01:22:26.470
Hail!

01:22:27.054 --> 01:22:28.639
Mathayus!

01:23:01.839 --> 01:23:05.217
Stay here with us, Balthazar.
There's much work to be done.

01:23:05.342 --> 01:23:07.845
I have to look after my own people.

01:23:08.095 --> 01:23:09.513
You're a king now.

01:23:10.139 --> 01:23:11.807
<i>And a good one, I think.</i>

01:23:12.683 --> 01:23:16.353
Don't forget how you got here,
or the people you came from.

01:23:16.854 --> 01:23:19.106
My people will live on through me.

01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:23.277
Remember, there will always be
a place for you here.

01:23:24.194 --> 01:23:25.529
Live free.

01:23:26.530 --> 01:23:28.282
Rule well.

01:23:33.829 --> 01:23:38.667
Remember, Nubian eyes will be watching you,
Scorpion King.

01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:47.051
I see a time of great peace
and prosperity ahead.

01:23:47.801 --> 01:23:49.511
How is it you see this?

01:23:49.887 --> 01:23:53.098
Don't the legends say
you'll lose your powers if you...

01:23:55.225 --> 01:23:59.063
Can you think of a better way to keep
a king from taking advantage?

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:01.732
<i>Neither could my ancestors.</i>

01:24:03.317 --> 01:24:05.694
How long will this time of peace last?

01:24:08.739 --> 01:24:10.991
Nothing lasts forever, my king.

01:24:12.576 --> 01:24:15.913
And that is the destiny of all kingdoms.

01:24:16.747 --> 01:24:19.083
Then we'll make our own destiny.
