Honey, when you were
talking about those flowers,

01:43.037 --> 01:45.437
was it a metaphor for anything?

01:45.439 --> 01:46.872
Was it?

01:46.874 --> 01:49.174
Honey? Metaphor?

01:50.578 --> 01:52.611

be furious, but nothing.

which of us should be

02:10.664 --> 02:12.397

Smithers, I see
you're one of those

02:37.525 --> 02:39.825
truly devoted people
who make one forget

02:39.827 --> 02:42.094
love is an illusion.

02:42.096 --> 02:44.429
Eh, I'm just a man

(rolling "R"):
Rolando.

03:10.157 --> 03:12.124
Well, I believe in true love.

I saw profit.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.294

Hey, Homie.

03:20.067 --> 03:22.801
That's our cue.

03:22.803 --> 03:25.237
Lenny, when you say
"That's our cue,"

03:25.239 --> 03:26.705
then you're supposed
to leave.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.507
Dear God, so many times

03:28.509 --> 03:30.842
I must have looked
like a complete ass.

03:30.844 --> 03:33.145
Homer, this is the
part of the marriage

03:33.147 --> 03:35.214
where the needle
is on "E,"

03:35.216 --> 03:38.550
but we still have
a little more gas.

03:38.552 --> 03:41.887
The brink of doom,
where I do my best work.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.689
And I want to break
out of our rut,

03:43.691 --> 03:45.824
so I brought us
a nice lunch.

03:45.826 --> 03:49.361
Oh, honey, you've given me
a big appetite.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.829
For what?

03:50.831 --> 03:52.564
HOMER:<i> Careful, Homer,</i>
<i> she's expecting</i>

03:52.566 --> 03:54.566
<i> a non-food answer.</i>

03:54.568 --> 03:57.703

Oh...

03:57.705 --> 03:59.037
<i> Well, I have to admit,</i>

03:59.039 --> 04:00.906
<i>that was suggested by the nose.</i>

04:00.908 --> 04:03.075
(nasally):
<i> Finally, some credit.</i>

04:03.077 --> 04:04.509
Mmm...

04:04.511 --> 04:07.179
Wait, I want to know that
you're really gonna change.

04:07.181 --> 04:10.215
Marge, I get it.
I truly get it.

04:10.217 --> 04:13.452
And to prove it,
I'm eating a carrot.

04:13.454 --> 04:16.455
Oh...

04:16.457 --> 04:17.756
Mmm.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.726
Sir, do you need help
with that tea bag?

04:20.728 --> 04:23.128
No, I can talk
to Nigel by myself.

04:24.565 --> 04:27.132
Nigel, you were wrong
about the Crimean War,

04:27.134 --> 04:28.567
and you're wrong now.

04:28.569 --> 04:30.435
Love can endure.

04:30.437 --> 04:33.205
Oh, I could dissolve
that union as easily

04:33.207 --> 04:36.141
as the tea dissolves
this sugar.

04:36.143 --> 04:37.909
Smithers, did you see him
heft that sugar cube?

04:37.911 --> 04:39.278
Did I.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.046
Monty, I can
break up that couple,

04:41.048 --> 04:43.915
and I'd wager five million
on it.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.751
Dollars or pounds?
Pounds.

04:45.753 --> 04:48.220
Sterling or flesh?
Sterling, this time.

04:48.222 --> 04:50.722
Oh, that money is
as good as mine.

05:04.338 --> 05:06.238
Thanks, Alfred,
but my marriage is

05:06.240 --> 05:09.107
in a very unusual
condition-- good--

05:09.109 --> 05:11.009
and I want to get home.
Now, now.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.511
I'm an old friend
of your boss',

05:12.513 --> 05:14.279
and if you turn me down,

05:14.281 --> 05:16.181
it will not go
down favorably.

05:16.183 --> 05:18.250
Will it go down unfavorably?

05:18.252 --> 05:20.285

You thumped one melon

06:33.894 --> 06:36.328
If you knew anything
about me, you would know

06:36.330 --> 06:39.831
I would never, ever shop

Homer, have you ever thought
there might have been

06:41.935 --> 06:46.271
other melons-- bigger,
smaller, more exciting?

06:46.273 --> 06:49.408

You drew me in fifth grade,

and I've never
gotten over you.

06:54.014 --> 06:57.716

wondered something.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.704
Who are you talking about
when you say "Midge"?

07:19.706 --> 07:21.106

Homer's wife attractive?

07:31.485 --> 07:33.452
Yeah. She barely
knows I exist.

07:33.454 --> 07:35.654
Which is the only thing
I got going for me.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.823
Well, how would you like me
to set you up

I haven't even put
a coin in the meter.

09:39.279 --> 09:42.547
Just what I needed
to hear.

09:42.549 --> 09:44.215
Oh... Oh, damn it.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.151
(gasps)

09:47.521 --> 09:50.956
Aw, maybe now I can
finish my novel.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.525
I just wish I hadn't
left it in there.

09:58.065 --> 10:00.265
Yeah, well, don't worry,
you still got old Moe.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.934
Moe 2.0.
It's a whole new me.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.970
I even bought one
of those new gizmos

10:04.972 --> 10:07.572
that everyone's using.

10:07.574 --> 10:09.374
Why'd you close
the bar?

10:09.376 --> 10:12.077
Well, I've been set up
in a high-end establishment

10:12.079 --> 10:13.812
by a well-heeled backer.

10:13.814 --> 10:16.147
Really, you should see
the heels on this guy.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.816
MoHo House?

10:17.818 --> 10:21.119
Yes, MoHo House, the vaguely
British, invitation-only club

10:21.121 --> 10:23.655
<i> that celebrities</i>
<i> who don't want publicity</i>

10:23.657 --> 10:25.457
<i> can be sure to be seen at.</i>

10:25.459 --> 10:28.026
<i> I'm going there now.</i>
<i> Don't tell anyone.</i>

10:29.262 --> 10:31.463
Tonight is the grand opening
for the town's hottest

10:31.465 --> 10:33.765
new destination,
run by the man most in demand

10:33.767 --> 10:37.102
for Springfield's
haunted houses, Moe Szyslak.

10:37.104 --> 10:38.570
(growling)

10:38.572 --> 10:39.904
Oh, sorry,
force of habit.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.139
(chuckles)
How you doing?

10:41.141 --> 10:42.307
Good to see you,
Mr. Mayor.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.442
Bumblebee Man,<i> ¿cómo está?</i>

10:44.444 --> 10:46.077
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:46.079 --> 10:49.581
No can do, Mr. "Movie Star."

10:49.583 --> 10:50.949
Your last picture...
(chuckles)

10:50.951 --> 10:52.183
was a bomb.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.352
The trailer gave away too much,

10:54.354 --> 10:56.321
like, uh, the fact
that it was terrible.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.789
I deserve a good time.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.324
I can have a good time.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.059
The heck with Homer.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.429
Thanks for the lift, Homer.

11:04.431 --> 11:05.830
(tires screech)

11:05.832 --> 11:07.265
(groans)

11:07.267 --> 11:10.602

taking this seriously enough.

BURNS:
What are you up to, Nigel?

11:15.876 --> 11:18.143
Oh, just stacking the deck
in my favor,

11:18.145 --> 11:20.211
as sporting men are wont to do.

11:20.213 --> 11:23.114
A posh club,
beautiful single men and women,

11:23.116 --> 11:27.519
irresistible temptations
to my unsuspecting quarry.

11:27.521 --> 11:30.388
(scoffs) Good luck
breaking them apart.

11:30.390 --> 11:31.790
See you.
Hmm.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.324

11:33.326 --> 11:34.959
HOMER:
<i> I can have fun by myself.</i>

11:34.961 --> 11:36.695
Would you care
to spill a drink on me

11:36.697 --> 11:38.863
and use it as an excuse
to meet me?

11:38.865 --> 11:40.298
Can I eat the cherry first?

11:40.300 --> 11:41.966
Don't take too long.

11:41.968 --> 11:44.035
I might;
I asked for extra cherries.

11:44.037 --> 11:47.072
(whispering loudly):
They don't charge
for extra cherries.

11:47.074 --> 11:51.076
Monty, what say we make
this wager something meaningful?

11:51.078 --> 11:52.143
Like what?

11:52.145 --> 11:54.079
How about my
entire fortune

11:54.081 --> 11:56.014
against your
boy Friday?

11:56.016 --> 11:57.015
(gasps)

11:57.017 --> 11:58.683
Smithers?

11:58.685 --> 11:59.818
(grunting)

11:59.820 --> 12:01.920
Oh.
(groans)

12:01.922 --> 12:04.055
Well, I can't possibly
lose. You're on.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.658
Mr. Burns, you can't use me
as a gambling chip.

12:06.660 --> 12:08.526
Check your contract.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.428
(sighs)
I'll be darned.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.330
It also says I'm permitted
to mold your hair

12:12.332 --> 12:14.165
into whimsical shapes.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.233
Smithers want
a cracker?

12:15.235 --> 12:17.368
(groans)
Got to get a better lawyer.

12:17.370 --> 12:20.004
Ooh, those fingers.

12:20.006 --> 12:21.206
(chattering)

12:21.208 --> 12:22.941
The chimp yes,
the clown no.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.242
Don't tell me,

12:24.244 --> 12:26.111
it's because I'm Jewish.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.212
No, it's 'cause
you're a has-been

12:27.214 --> 12:28.580
nobody likes,
all right?

12:28.582 --> 12:30.582

it's because I'm Jewish.

12:30.584 --> 12:31.883

12:31.885 --> 12:32.951
Moe, good
to see you.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.686
Oh, good to
see you, Midge.

12:34.688 --> 12:36.955
Boy, who knew you'd look so
great in a strapless dress?

12:36.957 --> 12:38.189
Well, thank you.

12:38.191 --> 12:41.559
Methinks I see my opportunity.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.428
Why are you
telling me?

12:43.430 --> 12:45.263
I always considered
us friends.

12:47.234 --> 12:48.867
So, let--
uh, what's your name there?

12:48.869 --> 12:51.202
Brant-- Brant here
pour something for you.

12:51.204 --> 12:54.038
We got loads of microbrew
with crazy names,

12:54.040 --> 12:57.642
like, uh, Hops-along Cassidy
and Michelob.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.711
So, uh, where's Homer?

12:59.713 --> 13:01.713
We're not spending as
much time together.

13:01.715 --> 13:03.615
MOE:
<i> Whoa, this night,</i>
<i> when I opened up</i>

13:03.617 --> 13:07.218
<i> a fabulous new bar,</i>
<i> just got interesting.</i>

13:07.220 --> 13:08.486
(soft jazz music plays)

13:08.488 --> 13:10.188
Hey, Stogie, how about
a little "Moonglow"?

13:11.324 --> 13:12.657
Not the real moon.

13:12.659 --> 13:14.459
Oh, you mean
the drug.

13:14.461 --> 13:15.760
No, the song.

13:15.762 --> 13:18.263
("Moonglow" playing)

13:18.265 --> 13:22.400
"Moonglow,"
that's my favorite song.

13:22.402 --> 13:25.003
Yeah, you came into
my bar seven years ago

13:25.005 --> 13:26.771
and you played it
on the jukebox.

13:26.773 --> 13:29.107
I remember things like that.

13:29.109 --> 13:30.942
So, you want to dance?

13:30.944 --> 13:34.379
I actually do it a lot, but,
uh, nobody sees behind the bar.

13:37.350 --> 13:40.084
I guess one dance
couldn't hurt.

13:43.123 --> 13:44.923
So, can you
start Monday?

13:44.925 --> 13:46.791
Oh, you won't break up
the Simpsons.

13:46.793 --> 13:50.662
I'm not used to getting my arms
all the way around someone.

13:50.664 --> 13:53.765
Oh, God, I can't work for a man
I'm not in love with.

13:53.767 --> 13:55.900
<i> I've got to fix this now.</i>

13:57.304 --> 13:59.604
Simpson, you need to patch
things up with your wife now.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.873
We're fine.
Excuse me, bartender?

14:01.875 --> 14:04.676
I ordered three dozen wings
and I only count 35.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.144
Listen to me,

14:06.146 --> 14:07.679
this was gonna be a birthday
present for my mother,

14:07.681 --> 14:09.647
but I want you
to give it to Marge.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.282
Okay, what's the gag?

14:11.284 --> 14:13.818
You have to reconcile
with your wife.

14:13.820 --> 14:15.820
Mm, there's always a catch.

14:15.822 --> 14:19.023
I've seen a whole different side
of you tonight, Moe.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.693
MOE:
<i> Whoa, she's waving me home</i>

14:21.695 --> 14:23.194
<i> like a third-base coach.</i>

14:23.196 --> 14:24.996
<i> But could I really</i>
<i> do that to Homer?</i>

14:24.998 --> 14:26.831
<i> Damn it, I need time</i>
<i> to think here.</i>

14:26.833 --> 14:29.534
Sorry, this is great, but I got
to go stick plastic ribbons

14:29.536 --> 14:30.869
onto toothpicks.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.103
That don't just happen.

14:33.340 --> 14:37.642
If Moe can change,
why can't my husband?

14:37.644 --> 14:41.579
Well, um, seems to me the reason
your husband won't change

14:41.581 --> 14:43.715
is 'cause he knows he's got
a great thing with you.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.316
If he suddenly treated
you different,

14:45.318 --> 14:46.885
that should worry you.

14:46.887 --> 14:48.419
I mean, duh, I guess.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.054
You know? Duh?

14:50.056 --> 14:51.656
Hey, Marge.
Homie!

14:51.658 --> 14:52.991
I got you something.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.660
(sobbing)

14:55.662 --> 14:56.928
What the...?

14:56.930 --> 14:59.330
That's not from you.

14:59.332 --> 15:02.066
Can't you at least open it
so I can find out what it is?

15:07.374 --> 15:08.673
Marge, I got
the best gift

15:08.675 --> 15:10.441
I ever got you
in my life.

15:10.443 --> 15:11.743
Huh?

15:11.745 --> 15:13.745
(groans)
Okay,

15:13.747 --> 15:17.115
that's not great.
And why, if you were
trying to be close,

15:17.117 --> 15:19.684
would you spend the whole
evening away from me?

15:19.686 --> 15:22.687
Hey, you've taken me off
the market since I was 18,

15:22.689 --> 15:24.789
which I immediately
regret saying.

15:24.791 --> 15:26.457
Look, I'm on my knees.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.192
Why aren't you forgiving me?

15:29.262 --> 15:30.962
I'll follow you.

Why, Nigel here.

19:12.085 --> 19:14.785
Sir, you're imagining
people again.

19:14.787 --> 19:17.355
Well, then who gave
me this check?

19:17.357 --> 19:19.924
That's a coupon
for free frozen yogurt.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.325
Bah!

19:24.130 --> 19:27.165
Where is he going, and why is
my check torn to shreds?

19:27.167 --> 19:29.534
You don't have to pay him,
he'll be fine.

19:29.536 --> 19:32.003
Use me in a wager,
will he?

19:32.005 --> 19:33.638
Mmm!
Mmm.
