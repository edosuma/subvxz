WEBVTT

00:04.506 --> 00:08.169
I can't believe we're gonna have
an actual TV star in our homeroom.

00:08.277 --> 00:10.643
Come on, Lilly,
give the guy some space.

00:10.712 --> 00:13.306
I'm sure the whole reason he's coming
to school here in the first place

00:13.382 --> 00:15.111
is so he can be treated
like a normal kid.

00:15.184 --> 00:18.779
But he's not a normal kid.
He's Jake Ryan!

00:19.421 --> 00:23.687
The dreamy zombie slayer
on <i>Zombie High. </i>

00:26.295 --> 00:29.287
I never miss that show!
This is so awesome.

00:29.431 --> 00:32.423
I'm going to be this close
to a famous person.

00:33.936 --> 00:36.928
What am I, a grilled cheese sandwich?

00:37.172 --> 00:39.436
When you're Miley,
you might as well be.

00:41.009 --> 00:43.102
- He's coming! He's coming!
- He's coming! He's coming!

00:43.545 --> 00:47.037
Guys, guys, just calm down.

00:47.149 --> 00:52.314
Even though Jake's a big TV star,
here he's just another student

00:52.387 --> 00:55.686
who totally destroys zombies!

00:55.791 --> 00:57.190
Dude, you rock!

00:58.060 --> 01:00.585
Hey, thanks, man, but if it's okay,

01:00.662 --> 01:02.926
I'd like to say something to the class
before we start.

01:03.031 --> 01:04.191
Of course.

01:04.266 --> 01:06.234
- This is so cool!
- I know!

01:07.502 --> 01:10.528
Now look, I know my coming here
may be a distraction

01:10.606 --> 01:13.473
since I am, well, you know, a superstar,

01:13.542 --> 01:15.601
and <i>T'ween</i> magazine's
Hottie of the Year.

01:15.711 --> 01:18.009
- I framed the cover!
- Me, too.

01:18.113 --> 01:20.809
- I hung it in my bathroom!
- Me, too.

01:20.916 --> 01:25.182
Oh, my gosh, we have so much
in common! We both love you!

01:27.489 --> 01:32.483
Excuse me, superstar,
Hottie of the Year, your point?

01:32.895 --> 01:37.127
My point is, is that even though
I am all of those things,

01:37.232 --> 01:41.168
I want each and every one of you
to think of me as someone just like you.

01:41.336 --> 01:42.997
Really?

01:44.773 --> 01:46.764
Well, try, okay?

01:48.110 --> 01:50.908
- Say your line, just once, please!
Yeah, say it. Say it!

01:50.979 --> 01:52.776
Oh, come on! Say it!

01:55.684 --> 02:00.178
Dude, I slayed you once.
Don't make me slay you again.

02:02.591 --> 02:04.491
I can't believe how cool he is!

02:04.559 --> 02:07.551
I can't believe how cool he thinks he is.

02:08.030 --> 02:10.328
Hi, I'm <i>This Week In Hollywood's</i>

02:10.399 --> 02:13.493
Bree Yang Shixian
Takahashi Samuels.

02:15.003 --> 02:18.404
We're doing a story
on Jake Ryan's return to a normal life.

02:18.707 --> 02:21.039
Do you mind if we get a few shots?

02:21.109 --> 02:24.044
Not at all. How's my hair?

02:25.247 --> 02:26.680
Doesn't matter.

02:27.449 --> 02:30.680
Now, we want everything
to look totally normal.

02:31.019 --> 02:32.213
So I'll need makeup on Jake

02:32.287 --> 02:34.448
and some prettier-looking people
around him.

02:37.960 --> 02:40.258
Tell me again why you don't want
people to know

02:40.329 --> 02:43.594
- you're Hannah Montana.
- Because they'd treat me like that.

02:44.933 --> 02:47.731
Oh, yeah, it's much nicer over here
with Dandruff Danny.

02:55.610 --> 02:57.202
<i> Come on!</i>

02:57.279 --> 02:59.770
<i>You get the limo out front</i>

03:01.283 --> 03:04.741
<i>Hottest styles, every shoe, every color</i>

03:04.853 --> 03:08.721
<i>Yeah, when you're famous</i>
<i>it can be kind of fun</i>

03:08.790 --> 03:13.523
<i>It's really you</i>
<i>but no one ever discovers</i>

03:13.595 --> 03:16.928
<i>Who would have thought</i>
<i>that a girl like me</i>

03:16.999 --> 03:22.232
<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

03:22.337 --> 03:26.296
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

03:26.408 --> 03:28.171
<i>Chill it out, take it slow</i>

03:28.243 --> 03:29.904
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

03:30.012 --> 03:34.506
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

03:34.616 --> 03:36.140
<i>Mix it all together</i>

03:36.251 --> 03:39.345
<i>And you know that</i>
<i>it's the best of both worlds</i>

03:43.725 --> 03:46.489
Excuse me. Coming through.
Jake! Jake!

03:46.561 --> 03:48.927
Actual student, trying to learn.

03:52.334 --> 03:56.065
This is ridiculous. He's a TV star.
Big whoop!

03:56.605 --> 04:00.439
I'm starting
to think somebody's jealous.

04:00.509 --> 04:01.976
No, I'm not.

04:02.044 --> 04:04.239
And stop singing.

04:04.312 --> 04:07.679
I don't care that everyone's falling
all over him. I care that he's milking it.

04:08.050 --> 04:09.540
He's not milking it.

04:09.651 --> 04:13.087
You're the one who said he only came
here so he could be a normal kid.

04:13.155 --> 04:16.488
And that's when I said,
"No, Mr. President, you rock. "

04:18.192 --> 04:21.390
Oh, yeah. You can really tell
he hates all this attention.

04:21.495 --> 04:22.963
Let's get some shots down there, Jake.

04:23.031 --> 04:24.328
All right.

04:24.399 --> 04:25.661
Hey, s'up?

04:28.537 --> 04:30.004
Whoa!

04:31.973 --> 04:34.373
He asked me, "S'up?"

04:35.010 --> 04:37.501
- Miley?
A little help here!

04:44.519 --> 04:48.546
Hey, Jackson, this paint job is sweet.

04:49.224 --> 04:50.486
Hey, can I try that?

04:50.559 --> 04:53.084
Sure, just, uh,
make sure you get a good grip.

04:53.295 --> 04:55.957
- That thing's got a little bit of a...
- Oh!

04:56.164 --> 04:57.426
...kick.

04:59.568 --> 05:02.969
Wow! Dad, for me?
You shouldn't have!

05:03.171 --> 05:04.263
I didn't.

05:05.841 --> 05:08.935
My lease was up and I figured,
"What the heck?"

05:09.845 --> 05:11.073
So, what do you think?

05:11.146 --> 05:14.843
I think it makes Jackson's car
look like a piece of

05:14.916 --> 05:18.079
pie. Yummy, yummy pie.

05:18.153 --> 05:20.383
- Not so fast, slick.
- I just want to sit in it.

05:20.489 --> 05:21.683
Let me make this simple.

05:21.756 --> 05:25.453
I don't want you touching this car.
I don't want you breathing on this car.

05:25.560 --> 05:28.825
I don't want you looking at this car
for more than ten seconds

05:28.930 --> 05:32.696
without express written consent
of major league baseball.

05:35.704 --> 05:37.501
Dude, he so owns you.

05:39.674 --> 05:40.868
Whoa!

05:45.080 --> 05:47.378
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Vernon?
Something wrong with my locker?

05:47.482 --> 05:49.143
No, no.

05:49.251 --> 05:52.277
I just thought Jakey needed more room.

05:53.889 --> 05:55.186
What?

05:55.290 --> 05:59.158
And that's when I said,
"No, Mr. Trump. You're fired!"

06:00.395 --> 06:03.262
Hey, do you think one of you guys
can save me a seat in the cafeteria?

06:03.365 --> 06:04.798
- I'll do it!
- I can!

06:04.866 --> 06:06.356
Thank you.

06:07.602 --> 06:10.901
- Oh, Tony!
- Jakey!

06:11.006 --> 06:13.702
I just asked if you could get
the squeak out of the door.

06:14.042 --> 06:18.172
This is above and beyond.
Give me some love.

06:18.680 --> 06:20.147
- You da man.
- No, you da man.

06:20.215 --> 06:21.978
- Oh, no, you da man.
- No, you da man.

06:22.083 --> 06:23.744
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, great.

06:23.818 --> 06:26.446
Who da man that knows
where my locker is?

06:27.122 --> 06:29.716
- Oh, wow. Was this your...
- Yes, it's my locker.

06:29.791 --> 06:32.658
- Don't sweat it, Milly.
- Miley.

06:32.827 --> 06:34.260
Like it matters.

06:34.563 --> 06:37.430
Here's your stuff. Come with me.

06:37.499 --> 06:40.991
You're down by the boiler room.
Locker one.

06:42.837 --> 06:44.134
- What's this?
- Cheese.

06:44.239 --> 06:46.969
While you're down there,
reset the traps.

06:50.779 --> 06:56.809
Now while you're taking the test,
I expect complete silence.

07:01.156 --> 07:02.987
What was that?

07:03.892 --> 07:07.384
I had a Hannah thing last night,
and I overslept and missed breakfast.

07:12.234 --> 07:17.297
Okay, normally I'd be polite
and ignore that, but ow!

07:17.372 --> 07:19.840
If that's the thunder,
I don't want to be around for the...

07:20.976 --> 07:22.409
...lightning.

07:22.677 --> 07:27.205
Trust me. Been there, smelled that,
don't want to go back.

07:27.482 --> 07:30.042
Stewart, you know the rules.

07:30.218 --> 07:33.710
Oh, I hope you have enough there
for everybody.

07:34.689 --> 07:37.658
Only if they take
really, really small bites.

07:37.759 --> 07:41.388
I'm the only one that gets to do
sarcasm around here. Give it.

07:42.564 --> 07:43.724
Thank you.

07:43.832 --> 07:46.323
You guys got to stop
sneaking food into class.

07:46.434 --> 07:48.800
I'm already wearing my fat jeans.

07:53.041 --> 07:55.407
- Hi, Jake.
- I was gonna say that!

07:56.711 --> 07:58.372
S'up, Jake? S'up?

07:59.948 --> 08:01.643
- Lilly, you dropped something.
- What?

08:01.750 --> 08:03.183
Your dignity.

08:04.719 --> 08:06.243
Sorry I'm late, Mr. Corelli.

08:06.354 --> 08:09.050
I had a premiere to go to last night
and overslept.

08:09.157 --> 08:10.886
Oh, and let me tell you,

08:10.992 --> 08:16.055
Natalie Portman, Britney Spears
and Jake Gyllenhaal, name-droppers.

08:16.264 --> 08:17.561
Tell me about it.

08:17.766 --> 08:20.667
Keep smiling, and go.

08:24.506 --> 08:25.905
Thanks, Pat.

08:31.846 --> 08:34.440
Sorry, I didn't have time for breakfast.

08:34.616 --> 08:38.985
Can't have that.
It's the most important meal of the day.

08:39.054 --> 08:40.885
Enjoy.

08:41.623 --> 08:44.990
But I didn't and he gets to...

08:47.228 --> 08:49.753
Okay, I've heard enough out of you.

08:49.864 --> 08:53.664
Ladies and gentlemen,
gentlemen, gentlemen...

08:53.735 --> 08:55.930
Start your pencils.

08:56.004 --> 08:59.405
On your marks. Get set.

08:59.507 --> 09:00.940
Test!

09:03.044 --> 09:04.978
Hey, Miley,
can I borrow a pencil?

09:05.647 --> 09:08.741
I don't have one, and stop talking.
You're gonna get us both in trouble.

09:09.617 --> 09:11.448
Oh. Here, I have one, take mine.

09:12.620 --> 09:13.712
Thanks.

09:15.223 --> 09:17.691
Real smart. Now, how are you going
to finish your test?

09:17.792 --> 09:20.158
Oh, right. Do you have a pencil?

09:21.463 --> 09:23.363
- Weren't you listening? I don't...
- Ladies!

09:23.865 --> 09:27.096
What's with
the chitty-chatty bang-bang?

09:27.202 --> 09:30.365
- Jake started it.
- She's right. It's my fault.

09:30.472 --> 09:33.964
Jake, no, please. No need to be heroic.

09:34.042 --> 09:37.170
You do enough of that on the TV.

09:37.512 --> 09:40.743
If he were really heroic,
he would've brought a pencil!

09:40.815 --> 09:43.978
None of us knows
how hard it is to be a celebrity.

09:45.687 --> 09:47.712
Well, I do.

09:48.990 --> 09:50.890
I mean, I do imagine.

09:51.726 --> 09:54.217
You know what I do imagine?

09:54.295 --> 09:58.391
You and your back talk
and your gurgling intestines

09:58.500 --> 10:00.559
in the principal's office.

10:02.771 --> 10:04.102
Stop.

10:04.506 --> 10:08.772
I can't let this happen.
Leave the girl. I'm the one you want.

10:09.577 --> 10:11.943
If you've got the guts.

10:13.982 --> 10:17.816
I did that in the season three finale.
Nominated for an Emmy.

10:19.487 --> 10:22.012
Thank you. Thank you.
- No. Stop.

10:22.090 --> 10:24.285
But this isn't about me.

10:24.359 --> 10:27.260
Here, Miley, take this. It might help.

10:28.696 --> 10:31.187
An autographed picture of you?

10:31.299 --> 10:35.759
Yeah, the principal's been riding me
for one. Maybe it'll soften him up.

10:38.339 --> 10:41.831
Look at him. He never stops giving!

10:46.114 --> 10:49.015
"Don't let the zombies get you down.

10:49.083 --> 10:52.109
"Your favorite zombie slayer,

10:52.220 --> 10:54.745
" Jake fatheaded Ryan!"

10:55.924 --> 11:00.657
Ooh, looks like somebody's not happy
with their new celebrity classmate.

11:00.762 --> 11:02.593
You're darn right!

11:04.098 --> 11:06.965
Ever since he's gotten here,
he's just been obnoxious.

11:07.035 --> 11:09.902
He gets everything he wants
just because he's famous.

11:09.971 --> 11:12.132
Well, he's not the only star
at this school

11:12.207 --> 11:14.869
and I think it's about time that
she starts getting some of the perks.

11:14.976 --> 11:17.206
Another star? Really? Who?

11:18.613 --> 11:19.978
Me.

11:20.882 --> 11:22.281
I'm Hannah Montana.

11:23.117 --> 11:25.517
Yeah, and I'm J-Lo Mein.

11:25.787 --> 11:28.915
No, really, I am Hannah Montana!

11:28.990 --> 11:32.756
Come to this address after school
and I'll prove it to you.

11:40.268 --> 11:42.600
Are you out of your Hannah head?

11:42.670 --> 11:45.662
You can't tell Bree Yang Shixian
Takahashi Samuels this!

11:47.308 --> 11:49.708
It's like Clark Kent
ripping off his clothes

11:49.811 --> 11:53.975
and showing everyone his blue tights
at the Daily Planet Christmas party!

11:54.315 --> 11:56.374
I mean, why should I keep it a secret?

11:56.484 --> 11:58.918
If I told, then I wouldn't have
a locker in the basement,

11:58.987 --> 12:01.012
I wouldn't get sent
to the principal's office

12:01.122 --> 12:04.523
and I could eat breakfast in class
until I puke.

12:04.592 --> 12:07.959
Which Tony the janitor
would happily clean up!

12:10.164 --> 12:12.257
Hey, Miley. It's me, Jake.

12:13.568 --> 12:15.502
I'm in disguise.

12:16.204 --> 12:19.605
As what, an egomaniac TV star
in a hat?

12:20.642 --> 12:23.873
You're lucky. If my ego
wasn't so big, that would've hurt.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.948
Look, I was wondering
if I could talk to you for a minute.

12:28.049 --> 12:29.346
Sure.

12:31.352 --> 12:33.684
Sorry, Lilly, I meant Miley.

12:33.755 --> 12:34.949
No problem.

12:36.357 --> 12:39.224
He knows my name!

12:40.762 --> 12:42.593
Let me guess. You need me to move

12:42.664 --> 12:44.495
'cause I'm in
your favorite tan spot, right?

12:44.732 --> 12:49.760
Actually, I was just coming over
to apologize for everything.

12:50.371 --> 12:53.238
I'm really not a bad guy, and I hope
I get the chance to show you that.

12:53.675 --> 12:55.006
Why do you care what I think?

12:55.944 --> 12:57.434
Well, to be honest,

12:57.512 --> 13:00.538
you're the only one at school
who hasn't been falling all over me,

13:00.648 --> 13:02.115
and I kind of like that.

13:02.183 --> 13:05.584
- Plus, you're cute.
- Really? You think I'm cute?

13:05.687 --> 13:07.416
Not that I care.

13:07.522 --> 13:09.922
Dude, you're Jake Ryan!

13:09.991 --> 13:12.960
Yeah, I guess my disguise didn't work.

13:13.027 --> 13:16.394
- Wow, shocker.
- Come on, do the line! Do the line!

13:16.464 --> 13:19.490
- I would, but I'm kind of...
- Do the line!

13:21.202 --> 13:23.466
Dude, I slayed you once.
Don't make me slay you again.

13:24.005 --> 13:25.302
Yeah, you're better on TV.

13:26.941 --> 13:28.772
Miley, wait up.

13:28.876 --> 13:31.310
Look, I'm sorry, it's just...

13:31.379 --> 13:34.507
Well, most of the time
this whole star thing is cool,

13:34.582 --> 13:36.914
but sometimes I wish I could turn it off.

13:36.985 --> 13:40.386
- You know, just be a normal kid.
- Really? You do?

13:40.455 --> 13:41.945
Oh, my gosh!

13:43.124 --> 13:45.251
It's Jake Ryan!

13:46.761 --> 13:48.251
Jake. I love you!
I guess I'll see you at school.

13:51.432 --> 13:54.265
You know,
after you talk to that reporter,

13:54.335 --> 13:57.463
it's going to be like that
when people spot Miley.

13:57.538 --> 14:01.338
Okay, guys, it's a bathroom.
I kind of need to do this alone.

14:03.011 --> 14:05.980
- Are you sure you're ready for that?
- No.

14:06.080 --> 14:10.949
Lilly, I think talking to that reporter
was the biggest mistake of my life.

14:11.019 --> 14:13.715
On the upside, he thinks I'm cute.
Not that I care.

14:20.595 --> 14:23.587
- Start!
- Sounds like a dead battery, son.

14:23.665 --> 14:27.101
It can't be. I have to pick up Jennifer
for the Coldplay concert.

14:27.368 --> 14:29.165
Turn over, you piece of junk!

14:29.270 --> 14:32.706
No, no, no.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that, baby.

14:32.874 --> 14:35.741
Son, you can apologize all you want,
but without a new battery,

14:35.810 --> 14:39.177
you'd have an easier time turning
over Uncle Earl in his waterbed.

14:41.349 --> 14:42.941
Hey, Dad, do you think maybe I could...

14:43.017 --> 14:44.143
Oh, no!

14:44.218 --> 14:47.153
Come on, you were sixteen once.
Don't you remember?

14:47.221 --> 14:50.281
I sure do, which kicks
that "no" up to a "heck, no"!

14:50.825 --> 14:53.623
Please? I promise to be
a perfect gentleman.

14:53.695 --> 14:54.923
I'll bring her back on time.

14:55.029 --> 14:57.497
I won't make her go any faster
than the legal limit.

14:57.765 --> 15:00.734
Do you give that same speech
to Jennifer's father?

15:00.835 --> 15:03.201
No, but do you think that'd work?

15:03.771 --> 15:05.739
It ain't working on me.

15:06.507 --> 15:08.907
Please, Dad. I mean, have a heart.

15:11.045 --> 15:14.412
Okay, son, here you go.

15:21.022 --> 15:24.014
Come on, Dad. You said I could go.

15:26.527 --> 15:28.722
It was harder than I thought.

15:29.297 --> 15:33.393
Oh, I almost forgot. My sculpting spray.

15:34.202 --> 15:36.363
You never know
when you're gonna wanna

15:36.471 --> 15:38.996
lock it in. Ooh.

15:41.242 --> 15:42.641
Funny story.

15:42.744 --> 15:46.680
I took my son's car in
to get a new battery and...

15:52.587 --> 15:56.785
Well, long story short,
it needs a new door.

15:57.091 --> 15:59.025
Three days?

15:59.093 --> 16:02.722
It only took the garbage truck
two seconds to rip it off.

16:04.932 --> 16:06.194
Gotta go!

16:14.375 --> 16:16.570
So, son, what you doing home
so soon?

16:16.644 --> 16:19.545
Coldplay catch a cold? Get it?

16:19.614 --> 16:20.876
Coldplay?

16:21.349 --> 16:24.409
- Come on, let's go in the house.
- No, wait, Dad.

16:25.052 --> 16:26.713
I have to tell you something
about the car.

16:26.821 --> 16:28.288
Oh, your car's fine.

16:28.356 --> 16:31.154
Got a new battery for it. My gift to you.

16:31.259 --> 16:34.922
Now, come on, let's go on in the house
and we'll wrestle like we used to.

16:34.996 --> 16:37.328
It's not my car. Yours.

16:37.398 --> 16:40.367
- Something happened.
- What?

16:40.501 --> 16:42.969
When I was going to pick up Jennifer,
very carefully,

16:43.037 --> 16:47.565
her dad brought out the Rottweiler to
make sure that the dog had my scent.

16:48.142 --> 16:52.306
And one of the spikes
on his collar kind of...

16:53.314 --> 16:55.441
Well, look for yourself.

16:59.120 --> 17:03.250
Dang flabbit! Jackson Rod Stewart!
This is

17:03.324 --> 17:05.121
just a part of life.

17:05.193 --> 17:08.094
The important thing is no one was hurt.

17:09.931 --> 17:13.162
Wait, that's it?
That's all you're going to say?

17:13.233 --> 17:14.791
It wasn't your fault.

17:14.868 --> 17:17.997
Sometimes things happen
and it's nobody's fault.

17:18.071 --> 17:20.973
So let's go on in the house
and I'll bake some brownies

17:21.041 --> 17:23.567
- and let you lick the spoon.
- Ooh.

17:23.644 --> 17:26.840
Wrestling and brownies? Who died?

17:27.848 --> 17:31.546
You mean a father can't even bake
for his son and put him in a half nelson

17:31.652 --> 17:33.745
- without something being wrong?
- You're right.

17:33.855 --> 17:37.416
I'm acting like you,
being all suspicious of me.

17:37.525 --> 17:39.891
Oh, just let me put away
my sculpting spray.

17:39.961 --> 17:41.326
No!

17:42.597 --> 17:46.624
My door!
Where's my door?

17:48.069 --> 17:52.699
Okay, I know it looks bad,
but it wasn't my fault.

17:52.807 --> 17:56.709
So, you want nuts with those brownies
and some of the little sprinkly things?

17:56.811 --> 18:00.474
Dang flabbit! Robbie Ray Stewart!

18:06.854 --> 18:08.082
It was a secret.

18:08.155 --> 18:11.318
A really good secret
that kept my whole life perfect.

18:11.392 --> 18:15.021
And now it's just gone
because I wanted pancakes in class.

18:17.431 --> 18:20.559
I just wish you had thought of that
before you invited that reporter over.

18:20.635 --> 18:23.160
Me, too! I made a mistake.

18:23.237 --> 18:28.004
I'm a teenager. We act without thinking
and we get zits. It's what we do.

18:28.910 --> 18:32.073
So, any idea how you're gonna
get yourself out of this one?

18:32.413 --> 18:36.144
Daddy, that's your job.
You're a dad. That's what you do.

18:37.752 --> 18:40.880
How are you gonna help me
if you can't even keep up?

18:41.389 --> 18:43.983
Well, we don't have long
until the reporter gets here,

18:44.091 --> 18:45.922
but I do have a little bit of an idea.

18:47.094 --> 18:48.925
Let me just get these
brownies out to Jackson

18:48.996 --> 18:51.260
before his masseuse gets here.

18:52.199 --> 18:54.827
- What masseuse?
- Don't ask.

19:03.077 --> 19:05.170
Hi. I'm <i>This Week In Hollywood's</i>

19:05.279 --> 19:08.180
Bree Yang Shixian
Takahashi Samuels.

19:09.784 --> 19:11.979
I'm looking for Hannah Montana.

19:12.086 --> 19:15.419
Sweet niblets, that girl's done it again.

19:16.824 --> 19:18.155
Done what?

19:18.559 --> 19:22.188
My daughter has a little bit
of an overactive imagination.

19:22.263 --> 19:24.697
She likes to pretend she's celebrities.

19:24.799 --> 19:27.996
Last week, she was the Olsen twins.
Both of them.

19:28.069 --> 19:30.936
You talk about a <i>Full House. </i> Whoo!

19:31.038 --> 19:33.472
Anyhow, sorry if she caused you
any trouble.

19:33.541 --> 19:35.236
Not so fast.

19:35.309 --> 19:38.472
I've been doing a little research,
and the buzz

19:38.546 --> 19:43.176
is that Hannah Montana lives
somewhere in this neighborhood.

19:43.284 --> 19:44.478
Well, not in this house.

19:44.552 --> 19:46.520
Be sure to grab yourself
a sprig of that rosemary

19:46.587 --> 19:50.614
out of the garden on the way out.
It's delicious on fish.

19:50.725 --> 19:52.784
- Bye-bye now.
It's okay, Daddy.

19:52.860 --> 19:54.953
We don't need to pretend anymore.

19:55.029 --> 19:57.395
I think it's time
that the world knew the truth.

20:00.034 --> 20:02.002
I'm Hannah Montana.

20:04.739 --> 20:06.832
I'm ready for my close-up!

20:08.109 --> 20:09.098
Really?

20:09.176 --> 20:13.169
The closer I get, the more you look
like a bad Hannah impersonator.

20:13.280 --> 20:16.681
Oh, yeah?
Could a Hannah impersonator do this?

20:20.021 --> 20:22.080
<i> This is the life,</i>
<i>hold on tight</i>

20:22.156 --> 20:23.180
Oh, yeah!

20:23.257 --> 20:26.454
<i>And this is the dream, it's all I need</i>

20:26.560 --> 20:28.755
<i>Oh, yeah, you never know where you</i>

20:28.829 --> 20:30.262
<i>La-la-la-la</i>

20:30.331 --> 20:33.789
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>
<i>My name's not really Miley</i>

20:33.868 --> 20:36.564
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>
<i>I'm Hannah Montana, believe me</i>

20:36.670 --> 20:37.728
<i>Ooh!</i>

20:49.750 --> 20:50.978
Wow.

20:51.986 --> 20:54.511
I know. So where should
we do the interview? On the couch?

20:54.588 --> 20:55.885
Oh, uh...

21:00.061 --> 21:04.088
Who's at the door?
Is it my extra cheesy pizza?

21:04.432 --> 21:07.868
Get out of here, Elvis.
I'm trying to do an interview.

21:07.935 --> 21:10.665
My brother thinks he's Elvis.

21:10.905 --> 21:12.133
Hey, there, pretty mama.

21:12.239 --> 21:15.106
You wanna interview the King?

21:16.677 --> 21:20.704
Actually, I think
I've got everything I need.

21:21.949 --> 21:24.247
Thank you, Hannah.

21:25.619 --> 21:27.211
Elvis.

21:27.755 --> 21:30.622
I haven't officially introduced myself.

21:30.691 --> 21:33.216
I'm Billy Ray Cyrus!

21:34.495 --> 21:37.589
Okay, that's it, we're out of here!
Go, go, go.

21:42.103 --> 21:45.231
Y'all come back now, ya hear?

21:47.274 --> 21:50.334
It looks like you lucked out
this time, bud. But be careful.

21:50.411 --> 21:53.403
Next time you ring that Hannah bell,
you might not be able to unring it.

21:53.514 --> 21:56.915
Don't worry, Daddy, if I ever really do
decide to tell the world I'm Hannah,

21:56.984 --> 21:59.384
I'll be extra sure it's what I want to do.

21:59.854 --> 22:02.550
Yeah, well, if you do decide to do that,

22:02.623 --> 22:04.682
me and your brother's gonna
be standing there with you.

22:04.792 --> 22:07.386
Yep. In the meantime,
I'll be in the hot tub

22:07.461 --> 22:10.919
waiting for my daddy
to bring me a chicken fried steak.

22:11.799 --> 22:15.428
- There is no way...
- Car door. Uh-huh.

22:18.606 --> 22:20.540
It wasn't my fault!

22:20.608 --> 22:24.135
Let it go, Daddy.
Elvis has left the building.

22:24.211 --> 22:26.702
Uh-huh.
