OLDER TED: So, kids, there are
many buildings in New York City.

00:19.119 --> 00:22.520
<i>Thousands of apartments,</i>
<i>Millions of stories,</i>

00:23.289 --> 00:26.850
<i>And even though it's been decades,</i>
<i>and someone else lives there now,</i>

00:26.960 --> 00:31.454
<i>there's one apartment in particular,</i>
<i>that will always be our apartment,</i>

00:32.399 --> 00:34.924
<i>I have so many great memories</i>
<i>of that place,</i>

00:35.035 --> 00:37.230
<i>Marshall playing video games,</i>

00:37.570 --> 00:39.970
<i>Lily painting on the fire escape,</i>

00:40.807 --> 00:43.901
- MAN: Hey!
- Sorry, Mr. Matson!

00:45.111 --> 00:48.205
<i>And me making the coffee,</i>
<i>I had this coffee pot,</i>

00:48.314 --> 00:52.808
<i>It was probably 50 years old at that time,</i>
<i>and it made truly terrible coffee,</i>

00:52.919 --> 00:54.648
<i>We called it Shocky,</i>

00:55.021 --> 00:57.046
- Plugging in.
- Saving game.

00:59.526 --> 01:00.618
(GASPING)

01:01.861 --> 01:04.056
<i>I loved every last detail of that place,</i>

01:04.164 --> 01:07.565
<i>right down to the incredibly tacky swords</i>
<i>we hung on the wall,</i>

01:07.667 --> 01:11.797
<i>I never wanted any of it to change,</i>
<i>but that's not how life works,</i>

01:14.074 --> 01:16.565
You guys will never believe
what just happened to us.

01:16.676 --> 01:18.268
I don't even believe it myself.

01:18.378 --> 01:21.643
We were in Queens
and we decided to stop by my apartment.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.215
Wait, her apartment?

01:23.316 --> 01:25.614
I thought Aunt Lily lived with you
and Uncle Marshall.

01:25.718 --> 01:29.677
I could see how you would think that,
but I have to have my own place.

01:29.789 --> 01:31.279
It's an independence thing.

01:31.391 --> 01:35.020
- When was the last time you were there?
- Three months ago.

01:35.328 --> 01:37.819
What? It's like fat pants.

01:37.931 --> 01:42.425
You hope you never have to use them,
but you're glad to know they're there.

01:44.003 --> 01:45.800
- What the hell?
- What?

01:47.040 --> 01:48.837
This is my apartment.

01:49.175 --> 01:51.370
- Where?
- Right here!

01:53.480 --> 01:54.970
What the hell?

01:55.682 --> 01:57.479
Lily, this is a Chinese restaurant.

01:57.584 --> 02:00.678
No! No! This was my apartment!

02:01.221 --> 02:04.384
My dresser was right... That's my dresser!

02:05.325 --> 02:07.885
And this is my closet.

02:08.428 --> 02:12.592
And I spilled nail polish there.
There's the stain!

02:12.999 --> 02:14.466
Hi, how many?

02:15.001 --> 02:17.697
- Lily!
- Yes. You know me?

02:17.804 --> 02:22.673
Yeah, from your homecoming picture.
You're much prettier in the person.

02:23.776 --> 02:26.506
Yeah, I know, the bangs were a mistake.

02:26.613 --> 02:27.944
Where is my stuff?

02:28.047 --> 02:31.175
It's all in the back.
We could wrap it up for you.

02:31.284 --> 02:32.945
You want it to go?

02:33.219 --> 02:36.916
- This is my apartment.
- Not anymore.

02:38.124 --> 02:40.092
No way. You're making this up.

02:40.193 --> 02:42.593
Yeah, the building would've had
to give you some kind of notice.

02:42.695 --> 02:44.356
They sent you a notice about this.

02:44.464 --> 02:46.796
- When?
- Three month ago.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.528
And here's your mail. Minus magazines.

02:50.837 --> 02:54.637
Well, still, legally they can't just toss you
out on the street, you have a lease.

02:54.741 --> 02:57.710
Okay, so I didn't have
a written lease as such.

02:57.810 --> 03:00.973
But go ask my landlady, Mrs. Conroy.

03:01.214 --> 03:03.910
She may be 98 years old, but she still...

03:05.151 --> 03:06.550
She's dead, isn't she?

03:06.653 --> 03:08.587
Never even saw the bus.

03:09.789 --> 03:13.225
My apartment is a Chinese restaurant.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.456
- What am I gonna do?
- Come live with us.

03:17.230 --> 03:18.925
- Really?
- Of course.

03:19.332 --> 03:21.163
- You sure about this, Ted?
- Yeah.

03:21.267 --> 03:24.828
I mean, you basically live here anyway.
It's not like it'll change anything.

03:24.938 --> 03:27.429
No, it's like it'll change everything!

03:27.540 --> 03:29.872
Oh, Ted! You are so screwed.

03:29.976 --> 03:34.140
- What are you talking about?
- And why is that girl checking you out?

03:34.247 --> 03:35.976
Because I look good.

03:36.616 --> 03:39.380
BARNEY: Now focus.
You and Marshall are roommates.

03:39.485 --> 03:42.545
You have an amazing apartment.
Marshall and Lily just got engaged.

03:42.655 --> 03:43.781
Yeah. So?

03:43.890 --> 03:46.984
So, you're not still gonna be his roommate
when he gets married, are you?

03:47.093 --> 03:49.220
Someone's going to move out.
So, who's it going to be?

03:49.329 --> 03:52.093
Come on, Barney, I'm sure they've talked
about who gets the apartment.

03:52.198 --> 03:53.790
You've talked about
who gets the apartment, right?

03:53.900 --> 03:55.561
Yeah, we've talked about it.

03:56.002 --> 03:58.835
So, when Lily and I get married,

03:59.906 --> 04:03.603
- who's gonna get the apartment?
- That's a tough one.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.675
You know who I think
could handle a problem like that?

04:07.780 --> 04:11.409
- Who?
- Future Ted and Future Marshall.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.850
Totally. Let's let those guys handle it.

04:16.389 --> 04:17.981
Damn it, Past Ted!

04:19.259 --> 04:20.783
You blew it, dude.

04:20.892 --> 04:22.986
Now that Lily's there,
it's a whole new dynamic.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.087
- They're edging you out.
- That's crazy.

04:25.198 --> 04:28.224
They're not edging me out.
Marshall's my best friend.

04:28.334 --> 04:30.359
One of my best friends.

04:30.870 --> 04:32.929
He wouldn't do that to me.

04:33.172 --> 04:35.663
Just keep your eyes open.
That's all I'm saying, Teddy.

04:35.775 --> 04:38.539
Little things are gonna be changing
around that apartment.

04:38.645 --> 04:40.442
Come on, Barney,
you're just being paranoid.

04:40.546 --> 04:43.344
Okay, seriously, what is this girl's deal?

04:44.651 --> 04:46.676
- Sort of on a date with her.
- What?

04:46.786 --> 04:49.846
Yeah, yeah. I found her online.

04:49.956 --> 04:53.687
I'm tired of the whole bar scene,
the one-night hookups.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.852
I'm looking for a soul mate.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.362
Someone who I can love and cuddle.

04:58.865 --> 05:01.060
Or, so it says in my profile.

05:01.567 --> 05:04.035
(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

05:04.137 --> 05:09.871
But this girl, she wants the same stuff,
and it's bumming me out.

05:10.009 --> 05:11.840
All right, Ted, call me from the hospital.

05:11.944 --> 05:13.536
- All right.
- You're going to the hospital?

05:13.646 --> 05:15.739
No, see, he's gonna go back over there.
I'm gonna call him.

05:15.848 --> 05:17.110
He's gonna pretend it's an emergency call

05:17.216 --> 05:18.706
from a family member at the hospital.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.979
Oh, Lord! The fake emergency?

05:21.120 --> 05:24.487
That is the lamest,
most pathetic cop-out in the book.

05:24.590 --> 05:25.887
I expect more from you, Barney.

05:25.992 --> 05:28.688
Well, stay tuned.
I'm working on some stuff.

05:28.795 --> 05:31.229
But in the meantime, wish me luck.

05:33.099 --> 05:35.499
So, are you gonna talk to Marshall?

05:35.601 --> 05:38.069
He's gonna want the apartment.
I'm gonna want the apartment.

05:38.171 --> 05:42.130
- It's gonna lead to an argument. So, no.
- That's real healthy.

05:42.475 --> 05:46.673
So, when a serious issue comes up,
your response is just to avoid it?

05:47.447 --> 05:49.745
I should really make this call.

05:50.149 --> 05:51.741
Oh, can I do it?

05:55.254 --> 05:56.414
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

05:56.522 --> 05:57.887
Excuse me.

05:59.158 --> 06:01.649
- Hello.
- Hi there, sexy.

06:02.362 --> 06:06.059
- Hello, Aunt Kathy. What's up?
- Oh, nothing.

06:06.399 --> 06:09.766
Just sitting here,
thinking about you, hot stuff.

06:10.503 --> 06:11.936
An accident?

06:12.438 --> 06:14.872
Well, is Uncle Rudy gonna be okay?

06:15.508 --> 06:20.002
Aunt Kathy's got an itch
that only you can scratch, big boy.

06:21.748 --> 06:23.079
Oh, God!

06:23.182 --> 06:26.447
Why did he think
he could build his own helicopter?

06:26.753 --> 06:27.981
Come on, Daddy.

06:28.087 --> 06:31.022
Break me off a piece
of that white chocolate.

06:32.625 --> 06:35.651
Well, if he needs a transplant,
he can have mine.

06:35.762 --> 06:37.491
I'll be right there.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.220
You know, I...

06:42.335 --> 06:43.427
(SOBBING)

06:43.536 --> 06:45.231
See you guys later.

06:45.872 --> 06:47.464
(SOBBING) Put it on my tab.

06:49.876 --> 06:53.676
This'll be nice.
The three of us living together.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.772
I think it's a good setup.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.718
Man, this coffee's great.

07:01.354 --> 07:03.015
It's really great.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.055
Too great.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.331
What happened to Shocky?

07:12.432 --> 07:13.626
(GASPS)

07:20.239 --> 07:23.367
- What's this?
- My coffee maker. From my apartment.

07:23.476 --> 07:26.604
- Makes great coffee, right?
- Yeah, definitely.

07:27.046 --> 07:28.980
I mean, so does Shocky.

07:29.081 --> 07:33.074
Really? I always thought Shocky's coffee
tasted kind of rusty.

07:33.352 --> 07:35.013
Yeah. No. It did.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.885
I mean, I kind of like the rusty taste.

07:38.658 --> 07:40.853
I'm used to it. I don't know.

07:41.127 --> 07:44.995
Also, Lily's coffee maker doesn't,
you know, shock people.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.333
No, it's just...
You gotta admit that shock, that...

07:49.435 --> 07:51.528
(GRUNTS) Wakes you up in the morning.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.696
You know what else wakes you up
in the morning?

07:53.806 --> 07:55.000
Coffee.

07:56.509 --> 07:58.568
That's great. You're right.

07:59.679 --> 08:02.375
Roomies! I love it.

08:03.816 --> 08:06.580
They're edging me out.
They're totally edging me out.

08:06.686 --> 08:10.281
- I didn't believe it, but you're right.
- Told you. That Lily, she's a shrewd one.

08:10.389 --> 08:13.222
Yeah. She got you
a nice new coffee maker.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.853
- How dare she?
- It's not just the coffee maker.

08:17.630 --> 08:19.825
Done. The painting's done.

08:21.100 --> 08:23.125
- That is great.
- Nice.

08:23.870 --> 08:26.805
- Where do you wanna hang it?
- I don't know.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.698
Over the piano?

08:30.643 --> 08:33.009
Yeah, that would be a good place for it.

08:33.111 --> 08:36.808
Too bad the swords are there.
We kind of love those swords.

08:38.583 --> 08:40.950
Well, those swords have been up there
a long time.

08:41.053 --> 08:43.783
I know, right. I'd really miss them, too.

08:44.290 --> 08:46.315
So maybe Marshall's room.

08:47.660 --> 08:48.752
Okay.

08:50.129 --> 08:52.996
He was gonna take the swords down!
Can you believe that?

08:53.099 --> 08:55.795
Ted, why don't you just talk to him?
He's your best friend.

08:55.902 --> 08:57.028
That is I think.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.563
One of your best friends.

09:01.340 --> 09:04.241
The point is, maybe it's time
for some healthy communication.

09:04.343 --> 09:07.506
Healthy communication?
That's the worst idea ever!

09:08.080 --> 09:10.310
Look, you held off their first advance.
That's good.

09:10.416 --> 09:14.113
- Now, it's time to counterstrike.
- Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do?

09:14.220 --> 09:18.350
You gotta mark your territory.
And I don't mean missing the toilet.

09:18.658 --> 09:20.626
You gotta do something big.

09:20.726 --> 09:24.127
- What, like, buy a new sofa?
- Bigger.

09:24.964 --> 09:28.161
Katie's here. Okay, real quick.
Last night, epiphany.

09:28.267 --> 09:29.996
I realized what the world of dating needs.

09:30.102 --> 09:32.468
Ready? A lemon law.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.871
- A lemon law, like for cars.
- Exactly.

09:35.975 --> 09:38.808
From the moment the date begins,
you have five minutes to decide

09:38.911 --> 09:40.902
whether you're going
to commit to an entire evening.

09:41.013 --> 09:43.641
And, if you don't, it's no hard feelings,
just, "Good night.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.842
"Thanks for playing. See you never."

09:47.053 --> 09:49.613
The lemon law. It's gonna be a thing.

09:49.722 --> 09:51.883
Possibly starting right now.

09:54.126 --> 09:58.927
- Hi, Katie. Barney.
- Hi! It's good to finally meet you.

10:03.169 --> 10:07.162
Yeah. Katie, you are about to be
a part of history.

10:13.746 --> 10:15.407
Tell your friends.

10:16.582 --> 10:18.106
It's gonna be a thing.

10:19.452 --> 10:23.479
Man, Ted's been acting weird.
He's started labeling all his food.

10:23.589 --> 10:26.558
He even carved "Ted"
into that block of cheese.

10:26.659 --> 10:29.127
Yeah. Well, now it's Ed's.

10:31.230 --> 10:35.291
- I think he's not cool with me moving in.
- No, that's not it.

10:35.735 --> 10:38.863
I mean, you basically lived here all along.
Ted loves you.

10:38.971 --> 10:42.907
- So, what's he PMS-ing about?
- I don't know.

10:43.009 --> 10:46.206
But when he's ready to talk to me about it,
he'll come and talk to me about it.

10:46.312 --> 10:49.577
Are you kidding?
You guys never talk about anything.

10:49.682 --> 10:51.912
He'll just let it fester under the surface

10:52.018 --> 10:54.714
until he does something big
and passive-aggressive.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.913
You clearly don't know Ted.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.723

Oh, awesome! It's great, right?

11:11.070 --> 11:14.733
Yeah, I guess.
I'm just not sure if Lily's gonna like it.

11:16.442 --> 11:18.171
Well, I like it.

11:18.277 --> 11:22.236
So, I'm just gonna keep it right here,
if that's cool.

11:23.449 --> 11:25.747
Of course. I mean, we all live here,

11:25.851 --> 11:29.082
so we should all be able to have things
the way we want them.

11:29.188 --> 11:30.382
Exactly.

11:30.489 --> 11:32.184
Great. Terrific.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.217
You like the phone booth. It stays.

11:35.327 --> 11:37.386
I like this painting.

11:37.496 --> 11:42.297
So, I'm just gonna hang it
right here on the wall.

11:49.175 --> 11:51.268
Oh, so it's like that, is it?

12:04.924 --> 12:06.118
You're a jerk!

12:06.225 --> 12:09.661
No, I'm a visionary. Lemon law!
It's gonna be a thing!

12:13.232 --> 12:16.861
For the record, your little lemon law
is a symbol of everything that's wrong

12:16.969 --> 12:18.994
with our no-attention-span society.

12:19.105 --> 12:21.369
No, wrong, lemon law's awesome.

12:21.841 --> 12:25.208
It takes longer than five minutes
to really get to know someone.

12:25.311 --> 12:29.077
You keep giving up on people so quickly,
you could miss out on something great.

12:29.181 --> 12:31.581
Okay, you're on a blind date.

12:31.684 --> 12:34.278
Sitting across the table is that guy.

12:35.287 --> 12:37.847
You really think it'll take
more than five minutes

12:37.957 --> 12:40.585
to realize there will be
no date number two?

12:40.693 --> 12:42.024
Yes, I do.

12:42.128 --> 12:44.824
For all I know, that guy's my soul mate.

12:46.799 --> 12:48.790
Bad move Scherbatsky.

12:49.869 --> 12:52.531
Hi. Have you met Robin?

12:54.306 --> 12:55.796
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:58.144 --> 12:59.236
All right, Marshall.

12:59.345 --> 13:02.178
We're deciding right now
who gets this apartment.

13:02.281 --> 13:05.478
May lead to an argument,
but we're settling this.

13:06.452 --> 13:09.683
- Or we could flip a coin.
- Yeah, let's flip a coin.

13:11.257 --> 13:13.725
- Flip it.
- Okay. I'm flipping it. Here I go.

13:13.826 --> 13:15.453
- Flip it.
- Okay, here I go. I'll flip it.

13:15.561 --> 13:16.892
- Flip it. Go ahead.
- I'm flipping!

13:16.996 --> 13:18.224
Flip it.

13:19.098 --> 13:20.725
But before I do,
I just want to say something.

13:20.833 --> 13:22.767
You didn't even wanna move in here
in the first place.

13:22.868 --> 13:24.665
You said a prewar building
was bad for your allergies.

13:24.770 --> 13:25.759
That was five years ago.

13:25.871 --> 13:28.237
Now you can get prescription-level
antihistamines over the counter.

13:28.340 --> 13:30.433
Oh, snap. What else you got?

13:31.410 --> 13:33.901
Okay, I'm flipping. Heads or tails?

13:34.146 --> 13:36.512
- You don't need two rooms.
- Heads or tails, Marshall?

13:36.615 --> 13:39.448
- Like you need two rooms.
- We might be starting a family soon.

13:39.552 --> 13:40.519
Oh, no, you're not!

13:40.619 --> 13:42.814
There's no way you're having a baby
while you're still in law school.

13:42.922 --> 13:44.822
- It's gonna be at least three years.
- It could be sooner.

13:44.924 --> 13:47.552
We're not that careful
with our birth control! Two, zip.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.754
Oh, come on! You know damn well,
I move out, that room's going unused.

13:50.863 --> 13:52.330
Oh, and I suppose
you'll get a new roommate?

13:52.431 --> 13:55.696
Who's it gonna be? Barney?
You know, he cooks naked.

13:56.202 --> 13:59.296
Yeah, well, at least Barney
wouldn't take the swords down.

13:59.405 --> 14:02.738
We were bros!
These swords represent our bro-hood.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.572
And you took them down to make room
for your fiancée's stupid painting?

14:05.678 --> 14:08.647
My fiancée? Suddenly, she's "my fiancée"?

14:09.014 --> 14:10.447
Lily's a part of who I am.

14:10.549 --> 14:13.313
And if you're such a bro,
she's a part of who you are, too.

14:13.419 --> 14:15.444
She's a bro by extension.

14:15.554 --> 14:18.022
I deserve this apartment, Marshall.

14:18.424 --> 14:20.051
No more than I do.

14:21.227 --> 14:23.388
Great. So, let's flip for it.

14:24.964 --> 14:26.192
Flip it.

14:34.340 --> 14:36.774
So, is this how we're deciding
who gets the apartment?

14:36.876 --> 14:38.241
I guess so.

14:38.844 --> 14:41.608
How we doing this exactly?
Is this like, to the death?

14:41.714 --> 14:44.205
We should probably figure that out.

14:44.917 --> 14:47.215
He's okay. He's okay. He's okay.

14:47.953 --> 14:51.252
- Can I observe something?
- That this is kind of awesome?

14:51.357 --> 14:52.346
Totally.

14:52.458 --> 14:55.689
- I can't believe we didn't do this before.
- I know.

14:55.828 --> 14:57.056
(BOTH GRUNTING)

14:57.563 --> 14:58.860
Thank you.

15:00.499 --> 15:01.796
I can't believe this.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.233
I'm sitting here
with a beautiful woman I just met,

15:04.336 --> 15:07.669
eating at my favorite restaurant. Sweet.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.470
Well, it's a nice place.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.010
It's good to know the future has ribs.

15:13.112 --> 15:16.980
In the future, food will most likely
be served in gel-cap form.

15:17.349 --> 15:20.409
Plus, cows will probably have
died out by then.

15:20.886 --> 15:22.581
Or be our leaders.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.419
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

15:24.523 --> 15:27.549
Just one second. Hello?

15:27.660 --> 15:28.684
(CACKLING)

15:28.794 --> 15:31.592
Time's running out, Scherbatsky.
Last chance for the lemon law.

15:31.697 --> 15:32.857
Leave me alone.

15:32.965 --> 15:35.456
Four fifty-six. Four fifty-seven.
Four fifty-eight.

15:35.567 --> 15:37.592
We're only just getting
to know each other.

15:37.703 --> 15:42.163
Say I'm right and this could all be over.
This could be your call from the hospital.

15:42.608 --> 15:43.905
Sorry.

15:44.009 --> 15:45.271
Let me guess.

15:45.377 --> 15:48.141
There's been a crazy accident
and you have to go.

15:48.247 --> 15:52.980
No! I would never do that.
I don't wanna go anywhere. I'm all yours.

15:54.486 --> 15:57.922
Look, if you're a hooker,
I don't have a lot of money.

16:00.392 --> 16:01.552
(GRUNTING)

16:01.660 --> 16:03.059
- Oh, that was awesome.
- I know.

16:03.162 --> 16:04.390
Do it again.

16:04.496 --> 16:06.896
Okay, but this time,
jump up and I'll swipe your legs.

16:06.999 --> 16:08.057
Oh, yeah.

16:08.167 --> 16:10.192
(GRUNTING)

16:15.874 --> 16:18.274
Look. Here's why I should get the place.

16:18.377 --> 16:20.470
You and Lily. You get to be married.

16:20.579 --> 16:24.982
What do I get, right? I get to be unmarried,
alone, minus two roommates,

16:25.084 --> 16:27.848
and, on top of that, I have to be homeless!
Does that seem fair?

16:27.953 --> 16:30.319
- Oh, boo-freaking-hoo.
- What?

16:31.023 --> 16:34.584
Woe is me! I'm not married yet!
My ovaries are shrinking!

16:34.693 --> 16:38.185
Ted! If you wanted to be married by now,
you would be, but you're not.

16:38.297 --> 16:40.959
And you know why?
Because you're irrationally picky,

16:41.066 --> 16:44.160
you're easily distracted,
and you're utterly anhedonic.

16:44.269 --> 16:45.702
- "Anhedonic"?
- Anhedonic.

16:45.804 --> 16:49.433
- It means you can't enjoy anything.
- The hell I can't. I'm enjoying this.

16:49.541 --> 16:51.270
I know. This rules!

16:53.045 --> 16:54.239
(YELLING)

16:55.581 --> 16:58.880
- Hey, I'm sorry I took the swords down.
- Dude, that's okay!

16:58.984 --> 17:01.111
It led to this totally rad sword fight,
didn't it?

17:01.220 --> 17:02.710
Yeah, it did.

17:04.455 --> 17:05.888
(BOTH GRUNTING)

17:06.191 --> 17:07.852
You remember
when we first got these swords?

17:07.960 --> 17:09.222
It was the day we moved in.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.121
Congratulations, Marshall.

17:11.230 --> 17:13.493
We live in an apartment
with swords on the wall.

17:13.598 --> 17:16.762
List of life-Iong dreams,
you're now half as long.

17:16.868 --> 17:19.463
Crap. I'm missing one of those screws
for this table.

17:19.570 --> 17:22.368
Well, just use this wood glue. It'll hold.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.398
Yeah!

17:24.843 --> 17:25.901
(GRUNTING)

17:27.012 --> 17:28.309
(LILY SCREAMING)

17:32.351 --> 17:34.615
Oh, God! I'll be right there.

17:34.720 --> 17:39.123
Kevin, I'm so sorry. I have to go.
My friend's been stabbed with a sword.

17:39.758 --> 17:41.191
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

17:43.362 --> 17:45.796
Klingon insult. You have no honor.

17:46.265 --> 17:48.859
You know, if you felt this way,
you could have just been up front.

17:48.967 --> 17:51.800
No, I swear that was a real call. I just...

17:52.104 --> 17:53.571
Oh, forget it.

17:56.942 --> 18:01.470
I stabbed Lily. I stabbed my fiancée.

18:02.681 --> 18:06.617
Come on, Marshall.
Do you really think she's still your fiancée?

18:08.087 --> 18:09.486
I'm kidding.

18:10.389 --> 18:13.483
Hey, I think you guys
should have the apartment.

18:14.026 --> 18:16.494
But you fought so bravely for it.

18:16.595 --> 18:20.087
I wasn't fighting for the apartment.
I was fighting for...

18:20.199 --> 18:23.726
I don't know.
For everything to stay the way it is.

18:24.470 --> 18:26.597
But I'm not gonna get that, so...

18:26.705 --> 18:29.265
Seriously, take the place. It's yours.

18:29.374 --> 18:30.739
Is she okay?

18:30.843 --> 18:32.777
Well, they're just patching her up.
She's gonna be fine.

18:32.878 --> 18:35.938
So, get this.
I was on a date with this girl Jackie.

18:36.982 --> 18:40.679
What? You said she's fine. So, anyway,
I was on a date with this girl Jackie.

18:41.186 --> 18:44.349
Wow, Jackie.
You make a really great first impression.

18:44.456 --> 18:49.325
I have a feeling that tonight
you might end up being Jackie... oh.

18:51.897 --> 18:55.526
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to lemon-law you.

18:57.069 --> 19:00.937
It's out there. It's a thing!
The lemon law is a thing!

19:01.039 --> 19:03.007
Damn. I should've called it Barney's law.

19:03.108 --> 19:06.475
- But, you totally got...
- Just let him have this one.

19:07.846 --> 19:08.904
All set.

19:09.014 --> 19:13.144
She said she'd like to see the knights
of the poorly-constructed round table.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.485
That's us.

19:18.423 --> 19:20.084
A sword fight?

19:20.792 --> 19:22.817
- Sorry, Lily.
- Sorry, Lily.

19:23.061 --> 19:26.030
On Monday, I'm gonna have to tell
my kindergarten class,

19:26.131 --> 19:28.429
who I teach not to run with scissors,

19:28.534 --> 19:32.300
that my fiancé ran me through
with a fricking broadsword!

19:33.338 --> 19:36.865
Well, just to be fair,
it didn't go all the way through.

19:37.209 --> 19:41.976
I'm sorry. Is this a discussion of the degree
to which you stabbed me?

19:43.448 --> 19:45.712
You're right. I'm sorry.

19:46.485 --> 19:50.387
We were fighting to see
who gets the apartment. And I won.

19:50.489 --> 19:53.322
You didn't win. I gave it to you.

19:53.425 --> 19:55.450
- You know what, if I had tried...
- Okay, wait, wait, wait!

19:55.561 --> 19:59.088
I don't want that apartment!
It's a boy apartment.

19:59.198 --> 20:05.159
It's full of swords and video games
and kind of smells like dude.

20:08.173 --> 20:11.404
I mean, it's fine for now,
but when we get married,

20:11.810 --> 20:14.244
I wanna start a new life with you.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.070
In a new place.

20:17.816 --> 20:21.343
- Gonna miss the old place.
- I will, too.

20:22.688 --> 20:24.883
We're not getting married for, like, a year.

20:24.990 --> 20:26.981
Yeah, that's Future Marshall's problem.

20:27.092 --> 20:29.583
- Let that guy deal with it.
- Totally.

20:30.429 --> 20:34.160
Maybe it's the massive blood loss talking,
but I'm starving.

20:34.833 --> 20:38.291
- Let's go get some dinner.
- I know just the place.

20:39.838 --> 20:41.135
A Chinese restaurant.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.834
- I still don't believe it.
- I told you.

20:44.042 --> 20:45.532
Okay, a toast.

20:46.378 --> 20:48.505
Life is full of changes.

20:48.981 --> 20:53.111
One day you have an apartment,
the next day it's a House of Dumplings.

20:53.218 --> 20:56.779
But the important stuff doesn't change.
To the important stuff.

20:56.888 --> 20:57.946
- Here, here.
- Cheers.

20:58.056 --> 20:59.853
- Well said.
- Cheers.

20:59.958 --> 21:01.585
To the lemon law.

21:03.362 --> 21:04.727
Self click.

21:05.264 --> 21:09.223
And, by the way, I bought these glasses.
Bought them at Ikea.

21:09.401 --> 21:11.164
These are my glasses!

21:11.803 --> 21:14.601
I love this song.
I haven't heard this in forever.

21:14.740 --> 21:17.868
I'm pretty sure this is a mix tape
you made me in sophomore year.

21:17.976 --> 21:19.466
Yeah, right.

21:19.578 --> 21:23.036
Lily, your apartment makes
the best Shanghai dumplings.
