00:18.228 --> 00:19.362
Arastoo, what's going on?

00:19.396 --> 00:20.830
It's my brother,
Hamid, in Iran.

00:20.864 --> 00:22.765
He's sick. I have
to go back,

00:22.800 --> 00:24.467
make sure he's getting
the best care.

00:24.501 --> 00:26.703
You can't go back. You were exiled.
It's not

00:26.737 --> 00:28.371
your decision, Cam.

00:28.405 --> 00:30.173
Arastoo's thinking
of going back to Iran.

00:30.207 --> 00:32.408
Isn't that dangerous for him?
Yeah, very.

00:32.442 --> 00:34.277
I booked a flight, Cam.

they had a bad outing.
Oof.

01:51.455 --> 01:53.256
Hey, you know,
speaking

01:53.290 --> 01:54.624
of sports, I have
a question for you.

01:54.658 --> 01:56.292
It's somewhat bones-related.

01:56.326 --> 01:58.561
Please.
I welcome all questions

01:58.595 --> 02:00.830
about the skeletal system.
Right, okay. So in baseball,

02:00.864 --> 02:03.266
there's this surgery.
It's called Tommy John surgery.

02:03.300 --> 02:05.968
You mean ulnar collateral
ligament reconstruction.

02:06.003 --> 02:07.837
Some people say that, uh,
pitchers that come back

02:07.871 --> 02:09.572
after having this surgery
are even better.

02:09.606 --> 02:11.507
We're talking wicked fastball.

02:11.542 --> 02:13.142
Wicked being good or wicked bad?

02:13.177 --> 02:14.377
Wicked in baseball
is always good, Bones.

02:14.411 --> 02:16.612
Wicked.

02:16.647 --> 02:17.980
So... let's say this guy
who's had this surgery,

02:18.015 --> 02:19.115
he's, uh, he's playing today.

02:19.149 --> 02:20.550
According to
studies I've read,

02:20.584 --> 02:23.052
successful recovery
is directly proportional

02:23.087 --> 02:25.254
to time spent
in physical therapy.

02:25.289 --> 02:27.657
Generally, a year
is recommended.

02:27.691 --> 02:29.192
So let's say he's only,

02:29.226 --> 02:30.693
I don't know, completed
eight months of therapy.

02:30.728 --> 02:33.062
Statistically, it's unlikely

02:33.097 --> 02:34.530
he will have a wicked outing.

02:34.565 --> 02:36.432
Wicked! Ha-ha!

02:36.467 --> 02:38.468
I'm telling you, it's so great
living with a genius.

02:38.502 --> 02:40.536
You are very fortunate
to have me.

02:40.571 --> 02:42.238
I'll get Christine ready for preschool.
All right.

02:42.272 --> 02:43.740

02:48.112 --> 02:49.345
Christine...

02:49.379 --> 02:51.080
Yeah, it's me.

02:51.115 --> 02:52.381
Listen, I gotta make a bet.

02:52.416 --> 02:54.083
(phone ringing)

02:54.118 --> 02:55.384
Arastoo!

02:55.419 --> 02:56.619
I was hoping I'd hear from you.

02:56.653 --> 02:58.421
What's all that noise?

02:58.455 --> 03:00.022
Well, I'm just picking up
some ice cream for my brother.

03:00.057 --> 03:01.524
I'm at this place,
Jasmine and Rose,

03:01.558 --> 03:02.859
and I'm telling you,
they have the best

03:02.893 --> 03:04.193
orange blossom ice cream
you've ever had.

03:04.228 --> 03:05.862
Well, Hamid must be

03:05.896 --> 03:07.263
feeling pretty well
if you're getting him ice cream.

03:07.297 --> 03:08.498
The lab results just came back.

03:08.532 --> 03:10.500
Not one glioblastoma.

03:10.534 --> 03:12.668
So he's in full remission?
That's amazing.

03:12.703 --> 03:15.505
It also means,
one week from today,

03:15.539 --> 03:18.307
I will be coming home.

03:18.342 --> 03:20.109
I am so happy.

03:20.144 --> 03:21.711
For your brother, for you...

03:21.745 --> 03:23.546
and for me,
because I've missed you so much.

03:23.580 --> 03:25.348
Arastoo?
Are you still there?

03:25.382 --> 03:27.183
Sorry, Cam, I got to go.
SAROYAN: Wait, why?

03:27.217 --> 03:29.485
VAZIRI:There's this guy...
I don't want to scare you,

03:29.520 --> 03:30.720
but I think he's following me.

03:30.721 --> 03:31.881
Have they dug up your record?

03:31.889 --> 03:33.055
I have no record.
Officially.

03:33.090 --> 03:35.358
Hold on, I think I can lose him.

03:45.636 --> 03:46.936
SAROYAN:
Arastoo, are you there?

03:46.970 --> 03:48.204
Yeah, I'm okay.

03:48.238 --> 03:49.605
I don't know who that was,
but...

03:49.640 --> 03:51.574
(grunting)

03:53.844 --> 03:55.111
SAROYAN:
Arastoo?

03:55.145 --> 03:57.413
Arastoo!

03:58.782 --> 04:01.117
You.
Get Dr. Hodgins and Angela.

04:01.151 --> 04:02.618
And call Agent Booth at the FBI.

04:02.653 --> 04:04.020
Tell him I need him now!

04:04.054 --> 04:06.622
(voices speaking Farsi)

04:08.358 --> 04:10.359
I just spoke to Dr. Brennan.
She's on her way.

04:10.394 --> 04:11.661
Have you been able
to talk to him yet?

04:11.695 --> 04:13.095
Uh, no, not directly.

04:13.130 --> 04:14.497
But whoever took Arastoo
doesn't know

04:14.531 --> 04:15.811
that the line
is still connected,

04:15.833 --> 04:17.533
so we can hear
what's happening.

04:17.567 --> 04:19.267
Sort of.
Are you recording this?

04:19.303 --> 04:21.003
I started as soon as
he was taken.

04:21.038 --> 04:23.005
(voices speaking Farsi)

04:23.040 --> 04:24.173
Whoa, whoa.

04:24.208 --> 04:25.648
That-that was Arastoo.
HODGINS: Yeah.

04:25.676 --> 04:27.076
He said something about a vase?

04:27.110 --> 04:29.011
No, I think he said
"Valiasr Street."

04:29.046 --> 04:30.479
It's a thoroughfare in Tehran.
AUBREY: Do you have him?

04:30.514 --> 04:32.248
Is the call still live?
Shh, shh, shh.

04:32.282 --> 04:33.983
What are you doing here?
Where's Booth?

04:34.017 --> 04:35.718
He's on with the NSA, the CIA,
whole alphabet soup--

04:35.752 --> 04:37.553
anybody that's got
eyes and ears in Iran.

04:37.588 --> 04:39.388
He'll be here as soon as he can.
Did you try

04:39.423 --> 04:41.490
tracking him through
the GPS in his cell?

04:41.525 --> 04:42.725
He's using a cell
he bought in Iran.

04:42.759 --> 04:44.694
Angie, can you...
I'm good,

04:44.728 --> 04:46.095
but hacking into

04:46.129 --> 04:48.064
Iran's telecommunications
network?

04:48.098 --> 04:50.967
(voices speaking Farsi)
Oh, God, what's happening?

04:51.001 --> 04:53.703
(shouting in Farsi)

04:56.273 --> 04:57.673
(call cuts off)

05:20.364 --> 05:22.431
Mr. Vaziri,

05:22.466 --> 05:24.500
I am Majid Namazi.

05:24.534 --> 05:25.935
You're in Parliament.

05:25.969 --> 05:27.570
I've seen your picture
in the paper.

05:27.604 --> 05:29.305
Then you know
I am a man of influence.

05:29.339 --> 05:31.040
A member of the Majlis.

05:31.074 --> 05:32.942
What is this place?

05:32.976 --> 05:34.977
And who
is this?

05:35.012 --> 05:36.913
This is a surgical center
that is vacant.

05:36.947 --> 05:38.547
So we won't be discovered.

05:38.582 --> 05:39.849
NAMAZI:
Yes.

05:39.883 --> 05:41.217
As for the remains,

05:41.251 --> 05:43.552
that's why you are here.

05:43.587 --> 05:45.521
I want to leave.

05:45.555 --> 05:46.822
I am an American citizen.

05:46.857 --> 05:48.524
I demand to be let go.
In this country,

05:48.558 --> 05:50.426
you are still
an Iranian citizen.

05:50.460 --> 05:52.895
And I have an edict

05:52.930 --> 05:55.231
issued in 1997

05:55.265 --> 05:56.832
charging you with crimes

05:56.867 --> 05:58.100
against
national security.

05:58.135 --> 05:59.902
I was 18 years old.

05:59.937 --> 06:01.804
I wrote a-a poem about democracy

06:01.838 --> 06:03.239
that was printed in some
underground magazine...

06:03.273 --> 06:04.440
An act which
was considered

06:04.474 --> 06:06.008
undermining
to the Islamic Republic.

06:06.043 --> 06:07.243
But that edict

06:07.277 --> 06:08.778
was never even issued.
Otherwise,

06:08.812 --> 06:10.246
I never would have been allowed
to return to Iran.

06:10.280 --> 06:11.580
An oversight.

06:11.615 --> 06:13.015
One that I can correct,

06:13.050 --> 06:15.985
which would land you
in prison for many years.

06:17.421 --> 06:18.621
Unless...

06:18.655 --> 06:20.990
an arrangement can be made.

06:21.024 --> 06:22.391
What kind of arrangement?

06:22.426 --> 06:23.993
I am told,
since fleeing to America,

06:24.027 --> 06:27.396
you have become an expert
in forensic anthropology.

06:27.431 --> 06:29.365
Please...

06:29.399 --> 06:31.033
a demonstration.

06:31.068 --> 06:33.235
Make me believe
that you are

06:33.270 --> 06:35.771
as invaluable as I am told.

06:41.979 --> 06:44.313
The victim is male.

06:44.348 --> 06:47.083
Moderate to complete closure
of the endocranial sutures

06:47.117 --> 06:48.985
suggests an age
of 25 to 30.

06:49.019 --> 06:50.219
Furrows and punctures

06:50.253 --> 06:51.654
to the left temporal
and zygomatic bone

06:51.688 --> 06:52.888
indicates the body was scavenged

06:52.923 --> 06:54.390
by a mid-sized carnivore.

06:54.424 --> 06:56.392
The victim's dentition
is slightly worn,

06:56.426 --> 07:00.062
evidence he likely grew up
in an urban environment.

07:03.867 --> 07:07.036
Also, he suffers
from micrognathia,

07:07.070 --> 07:09.638
a distinct genetic condition

07:09.673 --> 07:11.440
which you also exhibit...

07:13.410 --> 07:16.979
...leading me to conclude
the victim is your son.

07:20.250 --> 07:23.252
His name is Darius.

07:23.286 --> 07:25.588
He was my only son.

07:25.622 --> 07:28.124
A good son.

07:28.158 --> 07:30.526
Yet he ends up like this.

07:30.560 --> 07:31.827
Didn't the authorities
investigate?

07:31.862 --> 07:33.496
How did you steal his remains?

07:33.530 --> 07:34.897
The only question
that concerns you

07:34.931 --> 07:38.134
is what happened to my son.

07:38.168 --> 07:40.069
If I don't get satisfaction,

07:40.103 --> 07:44.573

Booth is right.

a great pistachio.

09:24.348 --> 09:25.548

09:33.123 --> 09:34.357
Yeah, so he couldn't
have been taken too far.

09:34.391 --> 09:35.825
Arastoo knew the phone
call was active.

09:35.860 --> 09:38.394
So instead of asking
where they were going,

09:38.429 --> 09:40.930
he mentioned
specific landmarks.

09:40.965 --> 09:44.300
Yeah, like the, uh,
the Navab Safavi Highway here,

09:44.335 --> 09:45.902
uh, Valiasr Street...

09:45.936 --> 09:48.771
I pulled garbled sounds
from the background,

09:48.806 --> 09:52.375
like, uh, passing trains
at Rah Ahan Square

09:52.409 --> 09:53.910
or the protestors
at Azadi Tower.

09:53.944 --> 09:55.445
That's amazing.
Yeah.

09:55.479 --> 09:56.980
Now, we know
the car stopped here:

09:57.014 --> 09:59.382
Taleghani Street.
MONTENEGRO: So, now listen.

09:59.416 --> 10:03.453
They took three flights
of stairs or 36 steps.

10:03.487 --> 10:05.388
(footsteps)

10:05.422 --> 10:07.156
The question is,
are they going up or down?

10:07.191 --> 10:08.391
Up.

10:08.425 --> 10:09.959
The footsteps
aren't loud,

10:09.994 --> 10:11.694
which means they're using
the balls of their feet

10:11.729 --> 10:14.030
rather than their heels,
which occurs on descending.

10:14.064 --> 10:16.266
Wow. That's
very impressive.

10:16.300 --> 10:17.867
I used to work surveillance.

10:17.902 --> 10:19.202
Domestic
surveillance?

10:19.236 --> 10:20.436
I was just starting
to like you.

10:20.471 --> 10:21.905
Hey, whatever it takes
to keep you safe.

10:21.939 --> 10:24.974
So what's three stories up
at that location?

10:25.009 --> 10:28.611
Uh, it's a center
for plastic surgery.

10:28.646 --> 10:29.846
Or it used to be.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.281
It looks like it's closed now.

10:46.363 --> 10:47.931
I am sweating, Seeley.

10:47.965 --> 10:49.499
And it's not
because of the heat.

10:49.533 --> 10:50.967
You're doing great, okay?

10:51.001 --> 10:52.402
Everything's gonna
be fine, all right?

10:52.436 --> 10:54.037
Danny said, uh, this
guy's gonna meet us

10:54.071 --> 10:55.738
around the square somewhere.
Okay.

10:57.241 --> 10:58.875
As-salaam alaikum, Mr. Booth.

10:58.909 --> 11:00.310
Dr. Saroyan, I assume.

11:00.344 --> 11:02.979
Welcome to the Islamic Republic.
All right, thanks.

11:03.013 --> 11:04.447
Danny tells me you need a guide.
I am Hooshmand.

11:04.481 --> 11:06.073
One name, like Beyoncé.

11:06.074 --> 11:07.690
Great, how much you charge
for showing us the city?

11:07.714 --> 11:08.851
No, no, no, no.

11:08.852 --> 11:10.687
Danny pays me,
which is why he is my friend.

11:10.721 --> 11:13.523
Please, huh? Follow me.

11:13.557 --> 11:16.292
And Arastoo, is he's safe?
Oh, yes. He is very well.

11:16.327 --> 11:19.762
He was taken by a very powerful
man here named Majid Namazi.

11:19.797 --> 11:23.399
A member of the Parliament
here in Iran.

11:23.434 --> 11:26.402
Mr. Namazi, this is
Agent Booth and Dr. Saroyan.

11:26.437 --> 11:29.672
Please make yourself
comfortable.

11:31.241 --> 11:32.976
These are two tickets
back to America.

11:33.010 --> 11:35.812
The flight leaves
this afternoon.

11:35.846 --> 11:37.847
If you are on it, there
will be no unpleasantness.

11:37.881 --> 11:39.349
SAROYAN:
Wait, no!

11:39.383 --> 11:40.783
I need to see Arastoo.

11:40.818 --> 11:43.586
You said you can help us.
HOOSHMAND: I am.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.288
Sometimes there is a limit
to what can be accomplished.

11:45.322 --> 11:47.123
I'm keeping you safe.

11:47.157 --> 11:48.925
That is what I
promised Danny.

11:48.959 --> 11:51.794
BOOTH:
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

11:51.829 --> 11:53.196
What if we can help you?

11:53.230 --> 11:54.597
"Help"?
Yeah, help.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.866
If Arastoo is
actually unharmed,

11:56.900 --> 11:59.102
that means you need him alive.

12:00.838 --> 12:04.207
You have a murder
that needs to be solved.

12:04.241 --> 12:07.477
And if you brought him

12:07.511 --> 12:10.480
to an abandoned surgical center
rather than a real morgue,

12:10.514 --> 12:13.750
that means you're operating
outside the law.

12:13.784 --> 12:16.185
It is unwise to threaten me.
This is not a threat.

12:16.220 --> 12:18.287
This is an offer.
We're here to help you.

12:18.322 --> 12:20.082
You already have one
forensic anthropologist.

12:20.090 --> 12:23.226
I can offer you a great
coroner in Dr. Saroyan.

12:23.260 --> 12:25.294
Yeah, and an entire Jeffersonian
forensic team.

12:25.329 --> 12:27.230
And the FBI
in exchange for Arastoo

12:27.264 --> 12:30.066
after we solve your murder.

12:58.362 --> 12:59.762
Arastoo!

12:59.797 --> 13:01.330
Cam! Booth!
What are you doing here?

13:01.365 --> 13:02.832
Arastoo, I never thought
I'd see you again.

13:02.866 --> 13:03.900
Hey! Hey! Hey!

13:03.934 --> 13:05.601
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Hey, hey!

13:05.636 --> 13:07.370
Hands off her!
Hey, get your hands off of her!

13:07.404 --> 13:09.572
NAMAZI:
They are not married.

13:09.606 --> 13:12.508
If they kissed like that in the
public, they would be arrested.

13:13.777 --> 13:15.378
You're in my country now.

13:15.412 --> 13:17.580
You understand?

13:19.450 --> 13:22.385
Now, do what you promised.

13:22.419 --> 13:24.587
What's he talking about?
Booth made a deal.

13:24.621 --> 13:26.689
We help and you get to go free.

13:29.159 --> 13:31.060
The victim's name
is Darius Namazi.

13:31.095 --> 13:33.563
He was 25 years old.

13:33.597 --> 13:37.033
Looks like you already
started the autopsy.

13:37.067 --> 13:38.534
Excellent work.

13:38.569 --> 13:40.703
Should be. I learned
from watching you.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.738
BOOTH: All right, look, what's
the official cause of death?

13:42.773 --> 13:45.041
Officially the victim
died from a broken neck

13:45.075 --> 13:47.877
after accidentally falling
down the stairs at his house.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.979
Government tox screen indicated
he was drunk at time of death.

13:50.013 --> 13:51.948
NAMAZI:
My son did not drink.

13:51.982 --> 13:53.349
This wasn't an accident.

13:53.383 --> 13:55.017
BOOTH: All right,
look, we need you

13:55.052 --> 13:57.019
to hook up the video link
to the Jeffersonian, okay?

13:57.054 --> 13:58.087
Can you do that now?

13:58.122 --> 14:00.223
(speaking Farsi)

14:03.360 --> 14:04.794
MONTENEGRO:
<i>We were able to bypass all</i>

14:04.828 --> 14:07.230
<i>of the government</i>
<i>Internet filters.</i>

14:07.264 --> 14:09.499
Which means we should be
connected...

14:09.533 --> 14:10.036
now.

14:10.060 --> 14:12.097
Hey. Nice work.
Can you see us?

14:12.169 --> 14:13.904
I-I see you, Booth.
Are you okay?

14:13.905 --> 14:16.239
BOOTH: Yeah, everyone's fine here.
SAROYAN: Hey, everyone, I know

14:16.274 --> 14:18.542
we're 6,000 miles away,
but I want us to run this

14:18.576 --> 14:20.744
like any other crime scene.

14:20.778 --> 14:22.446
I'm sending you all the X rays
and photos I have of the victim.

14:22.480 --> 14:23.414
When and where were
the remains found?

14:23.438 --> 14:24.481
Monday morning.

14:24.482 --> 14:27.517
The housekeeper found him at the
base of the stairs at his place.

14:27.552 --> 14:30.754
Hey, gang, in terms of insect
activity, we should be looking

14:30.788 --> 14:32.956
at the same beetles
and blowflies that we have here.

14:32.990 --> 14:34.591
Don't worry, we'll get
the bugs overnighted to you.

14:34.625 --> 14:36.993
SAROYAN: Based solely
on lividity, I'd say that

14:37.028 --> 14:39.863
the body was there four or five
days before being discovered.

14:39.897 --> 14:43.667
Hold on, if the body was
found inside the house,

14:43.701 --> 14:46.002
why does it look like a werewolf
was snacking on the remains?

14:46.037 --> 14:47.704
BRENNAN: Scavengers must've
gotten inside.

14:47.739 --> 14:49.706
Some of the gnaw marks
are definitely from rats,

14:49.741 --> 14:51.942
but there was
also a larger scavenger.

14:51.976 --> 14:54.344
Well, because we're in Iran,
the most likely candidate would

14:54.378 --> 14:56.913
be a jackal, so I'll need
you to swab to confirm.

14:56.948 --> 14:59.282
BRENNAN: There are multiple
impact wounds bilaterally

14:59.317 --> 15:01.184
to the radii and ulnas.

15:01.219 --> 15:02.719
VAZIRI:
Also subperiosteal

15:02.754 --> 15:05.822
bone bruising, consistent
with a fall down stairs.

15:05.857 --> 15:07.257
Okay, what
about evidence of booze?

15:07.291 --> 15:09.693
Uh, he was supposedly
drunk, right?

15:09.727 --> 15:11.428
I ran tests on what was left
of the victim's throat.

15:11.462 --> 15:13.396
Definitely alcohol.
Right, and since she hasn't

15:13.431 --> 15:15.265
tested the liver yet,
it's possible that alcohol

15:15.299 --> 15:17.200
was forced down his throat.

15:17.235 --> 15:20.170
That's the only explanation.
That's the victim's father.

15:20.204 --> 15:22.305
VAZIRI: The alcohol
itself is known

15:22.340 --> 15:24.241
as Aragh Sagi;
it's a homemade brew

15:24.275 --> 15:26.143
made out of fermented raisins.

15:26.177 --> 15:27.511
Even though alcohol is illegal,

15:27.545 --> 15:29.012
it's a common drink
among Iranian youth.

15:29.046 --> 15:31.248
Mr. Vaziri,

15:31.282 --> 15:33.350
the concomitant fracturing

15:33.384 --> 15:35.519
to the left temporal!
Blunt force trauma.

15:35.553 --> 15:37.554
Same as the other injuries.

15:37.588 --> 15:38.889
The force profile is wrong.

15:38.923 --> 15:40.590
Take a look
at the incisive edges

15:40.625 --> 15:42.559
along the fracture lines.

15:42.593 --> 15:45.128
So the victim was hit
before going down the stairs?

15:45.163 --> 15:47.931
Which means he was murdered.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.168
So you were right, Mr. Namazi.

15:51.202 --> 15:52.736
This was not an accident.

15:52.770 --> 15:55.639
I'll draw up
a report right away.

15:55.673 --> 15:58.942
Everything you need so your
own team can build a case.

15:58.976 --> 16:01.511
I believe we've done our part.

16:01.546 --> 16:03.780
No.

16:03.815 --> 16:05.615
All of you will
continue your work,

16:05.650 --> 16:07.818
and you will find
who killed my son.

16:07.852 --> 16:11.421
Until then... no one is leaving.

16:25.438 --> 16:27.739
Cam, this is Officer Zamaani.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.494
He's gonna be working
with us on the case.

16:29.529 --> 16:31.029
Darius was my cousin.

16:31.063 --> 16:32.664
This is the only reason
I am assisting

16:32.698 --> 16:34.332
with an illegal investigation.

16:34.367 --> 16:36.034
See here? these are all
the crime scene photos taken

16:36.068 --> 16:37.202
the day the body was found.

16:37.236 --> 16:38.770
SAROYAN:
And there's clearly evidence

16:38.804 --> 16:40.672
of scuff marks and blood spatter
all over the stairs.

16:40.706 --> 16:42.107
Right, there's no forced entry.

16:42.141 --> 16:43.508
I can see why they
ruled this an accident.

16:43.543 --> 16:45.343
Thank you.
We are as thorough

16:45.378 --> 16:47.812
and as professional
as you Americans.

16:47.847 --> 16:49.714
So what can you tell
us about Darius?

16:49.749 --> 16:51.183
Darius was a good man.

16:51.217 --> 16:53.051
He was smart, handsome.

16:53.085 --> 16:54.452
My uncle was very proud of him.

16:54.487 --> 16:56.354
Did you know that
he drank alcohol?

16:56.389 --> 16:59.157
Unfortunately, many young
Iranians today drink.

16:59.192 --> 17:00.992
Because of American movies.

17:01.027 --> 17:02.961
You drink?

17:02.995 --> 17:05.463
I do not disobey the law,
I enforce it.

17:05.498 --> 17:07.965
Did Darius have
a girlfriend?

17:08.000 --> 17:10.367
No. He was too busy.

17:10.403 --> 17:12.737
He spent many hours at his job.

17:12.771 --> 17:14.705
Darius worked at the bank, right?
Yes.

17:14.740 --> 17:16.608
His father placed him
in a very prestigious bank.

17:16.642 --> 17:19.377
Wait a second.
This picture right here.

17:19.412 --> 17:21.146
The doorknob.
Where does that door lead to?

17:21.180 --> 17:22.547
What part of the house?
That was, uh,

17:22.582 --> 17:24.148
Darius' home office.

17:24.183 --> 17:26.585
What did they miss?
No. No, I assure you.

17:26.618 --> 17:28.118
I checked that room myself.
No blood.

17:28.154 --> 17:30.422
That right?
Take a look closer, huh?

17:30.456 --> 17:31.856
Look at all the other
doorknobs here.

17:31.891 --> 17:33.592
They got fingerprints on it.

17:33.626 --> 17:35.994
This one here?
It's been wiped clean.

17:36.028 --> 17:37.429
So the question is
what did the killer want

17:37.463 --> 17:39.331
that was in that room?
That room

17:39.365 --> 17:40.765
was Darius' office, right?
Yes.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.067
Right, I'm gonna have
to go talk

17:42.101 --> 17:43.221
to the people he worked with

17:43.236 --> 17:44.970
at the bank.

17:45.004 --> 17:47.672
NAMAZI: <i>Agent Booth,</i>
<i>this is Omid Turan.</i>

17:47.707 --> 17:50.642
The president of Eram Bank.
Also an old family friend.

17:50.676 --> 17:52.677
Majid, do you understand
the danger you are

17:52.712 --> 17:54.762
putting me in by getting
this American involved?

17:54.786 --> 17:55.580
All right, look,

17:55.581 --> 17:58.021
Mr. Turan, I'm not looking to
get anybody thrown in jail here.

17:58.050 --> 17:59.884
That's why we're here after hours.
People could think there is

17:59.919 --> 18:01.086
a problem at the bank.

18:01.120 --> 18:02.821
This is a very
proud institution.

18:02.855 --> 18:05.190
I understand that,
but still Darius was murdered.

18:05.224 --> 18:07.525
And we need your help.
Please, Omid?

18:10.429 --> 18:12.364
Darius was a good worker.

18:12.398 --> 18:14.766
He would put in 60, 70 hours

18:14.800 --> 18:16.368
between Saturday and Thursday.

18:16.402 --> 18:17.736
Did you see Darius
last Thursday?

18:17.770 --> 18:20.305
On Thursday...

18:20.339 --> 18:23.475
Darius and I talked
before he left for home.

18:23.509 --> 18:25.844
I told him to leave
his concerns at the bank.

18:25.878 --> 18:27.312
But he would worry
about his work.

18:27.346 --> 18:29.381
What was he worried about?

18:29.415 --> 18:31.049
There was a contractor.

18:31.083 --> 18:34.085
Darius had denied him a loan
for a construction project.

18:34.120 --> 18:35.954
Darius said the man
had threatened him.

18:35.988 --> 18:37.689
Omid, why am I only

18:37.723 --> 18:39.424
now hearing this?
I did not think

18:39.458 --> 18:42.093
it was serious, but now...
Okay, look.

18:42.128 --> 18:43.561
I'm gonna need
that contractor's file.

18:43.596 --> 18:44.829
I'm also gonna need Darius', uh,

18:44.864 --> 18:46.898
work computer
and all of his files.

18:50.202 --> 18:52.737
CHRISTINE:
<i>Mommy, what day</i>

18:52.772 --> 18:54.105
will Daddy be home?

18:54.140 --> 18:56.808
Soon, I hope.
You always

18:56.842 --> 18:58.243
tell me to be precise.

18:58.277 --> 19:01.379
"Soon" is not precise.
I know,

19:01.414 --> 19:03.181
sweetheart, but right now

19:03.215 --> 19:04.883
"soon" is the best I can offer.
(doorbell rings)

19:04.917 --> 19:07.819
Daddy?

19:07.853 --> 19:09.087
W-Wait...

19:09.121 --> 19:11.723
No, Christine, wait.

19:11.757 --> 19:14.292
Oh, hello, there.

19:14.327 --> 19:16.261
I thought you were my dad.

19:16.295 --> 19:18.296
Really?
Uh, can I help you?

19:18.331 --> 19:20.598
My name's Jimmy, and what was
your name, little girl?

19:20.633 --> 19:23.301
I don't tell my name
to strangers.

19:23.336 --> 19:25.937
I tell strangers that
my daddy works for the FBI.

19:25.971 --> 19:27.739
Smart kid.

19:27.773 --> 19:30.141
Yes. She takes after her mother.
Finish packing up

19:30.176 --> 19:31.710
your backpack, sweetheart.
We're gonna leave in a minute.

19:31.744 --> 19:35.080
I was hoping to speak
with your husband.

19:35.114 --> 19:37.082
Why?
I'm here to collect on a debt.

19:37.116 --> 19:39.617
$30,000.

19:39.652 --> 19:42.821
I'm sure he'd like to settle
to avoid me coming around again.

19:42.855 --> 19:45.223
If you send an invoice
for whatever it's f...

19:45.257 --> 19:47.425
I thought you said
you were the smart one.

19:47.460 --> 19:50.895
Are you talking
about a gambling debt?

19:53.165 --> 19:56.701
Your husband lost big
on a double or nothing.

19:56.736 --> 19:58.903
It happens.

19:58.938 --> 20:02.140
It was on a baseball game,
wasn't it?

20:02.174 --> 20:02.803
Two days ago.

20:02.827 --> 20:04.509
Since it seems he's
avoiding his obligations,

20:04.510 --> 20:07.112
he should know that his debt

20:07.146 --> 20:09.848
could become your
responsibility.

20:09.882 --> 20:11.816
You need to leave.

20:11.851 --> 20:14.018
Leave this property now
or I'm calling the police.

20:14.053 --> 20:15.820
This is my number.

20:15.855 --> 20:17.722
Why don't you give me a call
as soon as you have the money?

20:17.757 --> 20:18.923
Otherwise, I'm gonna
have to drop by again,

20:18.958 --> 20:20.959
and you don't want
that kind of stress...

20:20.993 --> 20:22.994
being pregnant and all.

20:24.764 --> 20:26.297
MONTENEGRO:
<i>The bone scans</i>

20:26.332 --> 20:27.866
Arastoo sent were perfect.

20:27.900 --> 20:31.102
The replicas I'm printing
are exact duplicates.

20:31.137 --> 20:33.204
Hey, sweetie,
where have you been?

20:33.239 --> 20:35.073
I started printing out the bones

20:35.107 --> 20:36.054
almost an hour ago.

20:36.078 --> 20:37.870
I had to drop off
Christine at my dad's!

20:37.944 --> 20:38.830
What, no day care today?

20:38.854 --> 20:41.079
The reason she's
with my dad is not important.

20:41.080 --> 20:44.048
Really? 'Cause the crazy,
worried expression on your face

20:44.083 --> 20:46.117
is singing a whole
different tune.

20:46.152 --> 20:47.886
We have a case to solve.

20:47.920 --> 20:51.523
Unless you want Arastoo and Cam
to stay over there forever.

20:51.557 --> 20:53.057
And Booth.

20:53.092 --> 20:55.193
Right. And Booth.

20:55.227 --> 20:56.928
Blunt force trauma

20:56.962 --> 20:58.797
to the left temporal,

20:58.831 --> 21:00.999
partially obscured by predation.

21:01.033 --> 21:03.435
I entered the fracture pattern
into the computer.

21:03.469 --> 21:06.271
Whatever hit the victim
was multifaceted

21:06.305 --> 21:08.740
and definitely not
a common object

21:08.774 --> 21:11.376
like a hammer or a tire iron.
Also impact fractures

21:11.410 --> 21:13.912
to the right and left ulna
and radius bones,

21:13.946 --> 21:15.814
ribs and left clavicle.

21:15.848 --> 21:19.284
Arastoo sent me a splinter
from the wound to the clavicle.

21:19.318 --> 21:22.120
It's poplar, most likely
from the staircase in the house.

21:22.154 --> 21:25.123
Which leads us to the last
and most horribly awful set

21:25.157 --> 21:27.459
of injuries that Arastoo
noted in his report.

21:27.493 --> 21:31.496
Half a dozen strikes
extending over the whole body

21:31.530 --> 21:35.500
with some sort of V-shaped
blunt force instrument.

21:35.534 --> 21:37.735
Yeah, Arastoo thought
the victim may have been beaten

21:37.770 --> 21:40.138
by a metal two-by-four, the kind
used in framing a house.

21:40.172 --> 21:41.739
Possible, but
at this point,

21:41.774 --> 21:44.042
to name the weapon would
be pure supposition.

21:44.076 --> 21:46.177
Maybe, but Booth's trying
to track down a suspect

21:46.212 --> 21:48.213
who's a contractor.
And apparently,

21:48.247 --> 21:50.482
the guy has a record
for almost beating a man

21:50.516 --> 21:52.016
to death last year.

21:55.625 --> 21:57.226
(door opens)

22:04.400 --> 22:07.636
I don't know, is it me, or does
he just look guilty and scared?

22:17.780 --> 22:18.780
Stand down.

22:18.781 --> 22:20.581
Don't worry.

22:26.455 --> 22:28.856
He's CIA?

22:28.891 --> 22:30.291
No, no, no, no, no.
No, I'm not CIA.

22:30.325 --> 22:31.559
You tell him I'm not CIA.

22:31.593 --> 22:32.860
I'm here to ask him questions.

22:32.895 --> 22:35.029
I'm doing things
by the law only.

22:41.370 --> 22:43.070
He understands.

22:43.105 --> 22:44.972
And he's ready
to cooperate.

22:45.007 --> 22:46.541
Tell him that we know
that he threatened Darius,

22:46.575 --> 22:48.075
that Darius' neighbors
saw his truck

22:48.110 --> 22:50.311
at the house the
day of the murder.

22:59.922 --> 23:02.857
He says he went
to visit Darius

23:02.891 --> 23:05.660
in order to bribe him
but didn't meet.

23:07.462 --> 23:08.796
I believe him, tell him that.

23:08.831 --> 23:10.097
Tell him I believe him.

23:10.132 --> 23:11.232
Tell him.

23:39.795 --> 23:41.462
Okay, okay.

23:41.496 --> 23:43.898
He says, uh, that
Darius argued

23:43.932 --> 23:45.733
with a blonde-haired
foreign woman

23:45.767 --> 23:47.735
who left his
house very angry.

23:47.769 --> 23:49.737
Blonde, well, she would
definitely stand out.

23:49.771 --> 23:51.639
Someone must have seen that.
All right, well, that's a start.

23:51.673 --> 23:53.608
Do you want me
to ask him anything else?

23:53.642 --> 23:55.443
No, I don't want you
to ask him anything else.

23:55.477 --> 23:56.644
We're done here.

24:09.858 --> 24:11.859
Hey, so Hodgins will
just be a second.

24:11.894 --> 24:14.228
He's just going through
the evidence you overnighted.

24:14.263 --> 24:15.229
How are you guys
holding up?

24:15.264 --> 24:16.264
We're doing okay.

24:16.265 --> 24:17.632
Uh, no, we're not.

24:17.666 --> 24:18.833
It's crazy.

24:18.867 --> 24:20.167
We're being watched
all the time.

24:20.202 --> 24:22.803
So no time for summer
romance then?

24:22.838 --> 24:25.740
Well, premarital sex is
punishable by 100 lashes, so...

24:25.774 --> 24:26.941
Lashes?

24:26.975 --> 24:29.043
The Law of Hodoud
is rarely enforced.

24:29.077 --> 24:30.912
And "rarely" is
good enough for you?

24:30.946 --> 24:32.480
Look, I know you
blame me for coming

24:32.514 --> 24:33.814
to Iran in the
first place.

24:33.849 --> 24:35.416
And I'm sorry
it's come to this.

24:35.450 --> 24:37.184
But if I hadn't come,
my brother would be dead.

24:37.219 --> 24:39.420
No, I know,
I know.

24:39.454 --> 24:41.088
I just want us
to have our life back.

24:41.123 --> 24:42.189
We will.

24:42.224 --> 24:45.026
And I'll risk a lash
to convince you.

24:45.060 --> 24:46.394
(snaps)

24:46.428 --> 24:47.595
Hey, hey, hey, stop.

24:47.629 --> 24:49.697
Sorry.

24:49.731 --> 24:52.033
Okay, we do have a murder.
VAZIRI: Right.

24:52.067 --> 24:54.368
So I was combing over
the victim's clothing,

24:54.403 --> 24:57.505
and I found several
blonde hairs.

24:57.539 --> 24:59.373
Also there's traces
of vaginal fluid

24:59.408 --> 25:00.908
transferred
onto his underwear.

25:00.943 --> 25:03.044
Oh, okay, well, Dad's not
gonna be happy about that.

25:03.078 --> 25:05.146
What about the phone?
VAZIRI: It was repaired.

25:05.180 --> 25:07.381
We'll upload the memory
so you can have access.

25:07.416 --> 25:09.383
Hey, so I know
what fed on the victim.

25:09.418 --> 25:10.918
<i>Canis familiaris.</i>

25:10.953 --> 25:13.020
A dog?
HODGINS: Specifically, a dachshund.

25:13.055 --> 25:15.289
A wiener dog ate
the victim?

25:15.324 --> 25:17.558
HODGINS: Yeah, two of them, actually--
they were bred for hunting,

25:17.592 --> 25:20.828
so for them, the victim was a,
was a victory dinner.

25:20.862 --> 25:22.930
Dogs in Iran are considered
ritually unclean.

25:22.965 --> 25:25.499
They're rare, mostly brought in
by foreigners.

25:25.534 --> 25:27.268
HODGINS:
Yeah, and from what I've read,

25:27.302 --> 25:29.236
dogs need their own passports.

25:29.271 --> 25:30.538
So we might be looking

25:30.572 --> 25:33.607
for a blonde woman
with two wiener dogs.

25:33.642 --> 25:35.576
I'll tell Booth.

25:36.878 --> 25:38.179
(taps on door)

25:38.213 --> 25:40.614
I was told not
to bother you,

25:40.649 --> 25:42.450
but I thought
that you'd want to know.

25:42.484 --> 25:45.820
The CIA and the FBI
are working on a plan "B"

25:45.854 --> 25:48.289
to get Booth, Cam and
Arastoo out of Iran.

25:48.323 --> 25:50.224
So you interrupted
my work on plan "A"

25:50.258 --> 25:52.660
to tell me
there <i>may</i> be a plan "B."

25:52.694 --> 25:54.929
I'm sorry, I just wanted
to do something.

25:54.963 --> 25:59.100
I didn't want to feel quite
as useless as I am right now.

26:00.068 --> 26:01.969
I understand
how you feel.

26:02.004 --> 26:04.338
So far the only thing I've
been able to determine is

26:04.373 --> 26:07.908
the victim wasn't beaten
with a steel two-by-four.

26:07.943 --> 26:09.377
So what was he
hit with?

26:09.411 --> 26:11.512
I don't know.

26:11.546 --> 26:13.447
I feel like the answer's
in front of me,

26:13.482 --> 26:14.949
but, um, for
some reason,

26:14.983 --> 26:16.384
I'm unable to focus.

26:16.418 --> 26:19.253
Because you're worried
about Booth?

26:19.287 --> 26:20.855
Yes.

26:22.357 --> 26:23.958
But not because
he's in Iran.

26:25.961 --> 26:27.928
You want me to elaborate.

26:27.963 --> 26:29.964
Only if you want to.

26:29.998 --> 26:34.001
Typically, when I have
a personal issue,

26:34.036 --> 26:35.970
I turn to Angela
for advice,

26:36.004 --> 26:39.407
but then you were
the one that said

26:39.441 --> 26:42.276
that Booth shouldn't go
undercover to that poker game

26:42.310 --> 26:44.111
because he's
an addict.

26:44.146 --> 26:45.479
(sighs)

26:45.514 --> 26:47.648
You said there would
be consequences.

26:47.682 --> 26:50.785
So Booth is
gambling again?

26:54.122 --> 26:55.589
A man came
by the house.

26:55.624 --> 26:56.924
He gave me this card.

26:56.958 --> 27:00.394
He said Booth
owed him $30,000.

27:00.429 --> 27:04.265
And then he made
thinly veiled threats

27:04.299 --> 27:05.633
to me and Christine.

27:05.667 --> 27:08.669
Did you tell Booth
about any of this?

27:08.703 --> 27:10.371
Not when he's in Iran.

27:10.405 --> 27:11.739
Good.

27:11.773 --> 27:15.042
Till he gets back,
I'll look into this Jimmy guy.

27:15.077 --> 27:17.011
It's not your
problem, Aubrey.

27:17.045 --> 27:18.446
It is if I can help.

27:18.480 --> 27:21.415
Hey, now I don't
feel so useless.

27:27.389 --> 27:30.257
I tracked her down through
the passports for her dogs,

27:30.292 --> 27:31.725
both dachshunds.

27:31.760 --> 27:33.594
Oksana Kozlov, blonde.

27:33.628 --> 27:35.496
She's an executive for
a Russian oil company.

27:35.530 --> 27:36.931
Well, I'm gonna
need those dogs.

27:36.965 --> 27:38.532
There might be evidence
in them or on them.

27:38.567 --> 27:41.035
She shipped them back
to Russia two days ago.

27:41.069 --> 27:43.337
WOMAN: I demand to be told
what I am doing here.

27:43.371 --> 27:45.739
Why are we not
at the police station?

27:45.774 --> 27:48.175
You're here because we know your
little canine comrades snacked

27:48.210 --> 27:50.711
on a murder victim
by the name of Darius Namazi.

27:50.745 --> 27:53.414
We also have a witness who
saw you fight with Darius

27:53.448 --> 27:55.716
the day he died.
Did you try to leave the country?

27:55.750 --> 27:57.218
It is not what
you think.

27:57.252 --> 27:58.486
Darius and I...

27:58.520 --> 28:00.187
We were in love.
Really? Yeah?

28:00.222 --> 28:02.456
Because Darius' family has
no idea who the hell you are.

28:02.491 --> 28:04.491
Because he knew his father
would not approve of him

28:04.493 --> 28:07.027
sleeping with a woman
who was not Iranian.

28:07.062 --> 28:08.996
Are you saying he
disregarded religious law?

28:09.030 --> 28:10.965
I am saying
he was a reformer.

28:10.999 --> 28:13.334
How about the fight you had
the day he was killed?

28:13.368 --> 28:14.768
It was after work.

28:14.803 --> 28:16.370
I found him alone.

28:16.404 --> 28:17.705
He had been drinking.

28:17.739 --> 28:20.407
He was afraid.

28:20.442 --> 28:22.843
When I tried to get him to
tell me what was the matter,

28:22.878 --> 28:24.778
Darius refused.

28:24.813 --> 28:26.213
Said it was
too dangerous.

28:26.248 --> 28:28.048
But I wanted to help.

28:28.083 --> 28:29.650
I demanded he tell me.

28:29.684 --> 28:31.519
He yelled at me.

28:31.553 --> 28:33.154
We fought.

28:33.188 --> 28:34.622
And he told
me to leave.

28:34.656 --> 28:37.424
That's the last
time I saw him.

28:37.459 --> 28:39.493
No. No, you lie!
Stop.

28:39.528 --> 28:41.228
After you left, what happened?

28:41.263 --> 28:43.564
Nothing, I didn't
hear from him,

28:43.598 --> 28:46.967
so I came back to the house
on Monday to apologize.

28:47.002 --> 28:50.004
That's when I found
Darius and the dogs.

28:50.038 --> 28:52.940
It was terrible.

28:52.974 --> 28:55.743
I shipped the dogs home so
they wouldn't be killed.

28:58.880 --> 29:02.249
But Darius...

29:02.284 --> 29:04.652
I loved him.

29:04.686 --> 29:06.520
NAMAZI:
Agent Booth.

29:06.555 --> 29:07.955
Sanjar.

29:07.989 --> 29:09.924
Come.

29:16.364 --> 29:18.766
I have reviewed
Vaziri's work so far.

29:18.800 --> 29:21.235
The initial report was right.

29:21.269 --> 29:23.304
My son was a drunk,
a fornicator.

29:23.338 --> 29:25.673
He was a traitor to
his own government.

29:25.707 --> 29:28.075
Even in death, he was eaten
by an unclean animal.

29:28.109 --> 29:29.810
He was also murdered.

29:29.844 --> 29:32.846
This investigation
is over.

29:32.881 --> 29:35.783
You and your friends
are free to leave.

29:43.563 --> 29:44.597
Guys, change of plans.

29:44.631 --> 29:46.165
Pack up whatever you need,
I want to get out

29:46.199 --> 29:47.333
of here in five,
let's go.

29:47.367 --> 29:48.867
Wait, are you serious?
We can't just leave.

29:48.902 --> 29:51.070
Wh-What about what Angela found
on the victim's phone?

29:51.104 --> 29:52.838
We're so close to
catching the murderer.

29:52.872 --> 29:54.740
What are you
talking about?

29:54.774 --> 29:56.909
Angela recovered a text alert
from a security company

29:56.943 --> 29:58.877
that was monitoring
your son's laptop.

29:58.912 --> 30:00.813
The text said someone was trying
to access Darius' laptop.

30:00.847 --> 30:02.715
And this was
after he was dead.

30:02.749 --> 30:04.750
The killer must have stolen the
computer from his home office.

30:04.784 --> 30:06.552
Right, and then wiped
the prints from the door.

30:06.586 --> 30:08.287
Was Angela able
to track down who it was?

30:08.321 --> 30:10.407
No. I'm not going to waste
any more time on this.

30:10.408 --> 30:12.325
Why not?
Because your son drank?

30:12.359 --> 30:14.226
Because he fell in love with
a woman you disapprove of?

30:14.260 --> 30:17.196
I'm not surprised
you defend him.

30:17.230 --> 30:20.299
In the eyes of Allah,
you're also a disgrace.

30:20.333 --> 30:21.333
How dare you.

30:21.334 --> 30:22.768
Cam.
No.

30:22.802 --> 30:24.403
I will not let him say
another word against you.

30:24.437 --> 30:25.604
You don't even
know Arastoo.

30:25.639 --> 30:26.972
And yet you condemn him?

30:27.007 --> 30:28.641
You don't see
what he does every day

30:28.675 --> 30:30.509
to uphold the pillars
of your religion.

30:30.543 --> 30:32.344
Prayers, fasting,

30:32.379 --> 30:33.746
giving to the needy.

30:33.780 --> 30:36.749
The only acts of defiance
he's ever committed

30:36.783 --> 30:38.817
have been
in the name of love.

30:40.720 --> 30:42.040
So I don't care
what you do to me,

30:42.055 --> 30:44.923
I will not listen
to you judge him.

30:45.892 --> 30:47.559
VAZIRI:
The Koran says,

30:47.594 --> 30:50.396
"Allah is best aware of him
who strayeth from his way,

30:50.430 --> 30:54.266
and he is best aware
of those who walk aright."

30:54.300 --> 30:58.337
It's not for us to hold
ourselves above the Prophet.

30:58.371 --> 30:59.738
Only God is allowed
to judge.

30:59.773 --> 31:02.708
Our job is to show
compassion and mercy.

31:04.377 --> 31:06.145
VAZIRI:
Mr. Namazi,

31:06.179 --> 31:07.980
if you take away
the threat of imprisonment,

31:08.014 --> 31:11.016
we promise we will see
this through.

31:21.828 --> 31:23.529
Jimmy Kosinski.

31:23.563 --> 31:26.532
Wow, I'm surprised
that you had the nerve

31:26.566 --> 31:29.401
to use your actual name on
your business card there.

31:29.436 --> 31:32.071
Well, I find it helps
so people know what to call me.

31:32.105 --> 31:34.145
Okay, look, Jimmy, I just want
to be clear with you.

31:34.174 --> 31:37.576
You stay away
from Booth and his family.

31:37.610 --> 31:39.712
Agent Aubrey...

31:39.746 --> 31:43.582
let me put forth
a hypothetical situation.

31:43.616 --> 31:46.351
Suppose I were a bookie

31:46.386 --> 31:49.154
and an FBI agent
owed me, say,

31:49.189 --> 31:52.791
$30,000.

31:52.826 --> 31:54.860
You'd have me just forget
about the debt?

31:54.894 --> 31:57.529
I'd say you'd have to be
an idiot not to.

31:57.564 --> 31:58.697
Hmm.

31:58.732 --> 32:00.699
And what do you think
the FBI would do

32:00.734 --> 32:04.169
if information
about this hypothetical debt

32:04.204 --> 32:05.838
were made public? Say...

32:05.872 --> 32:07.740
to a newspaper?

32:07.774 --> 32:09.742
My guess is, the FBI

32:09.776 --> 32:13.445
would immediately revoke the
agent's top secret clearance,

32:13.480 --> 32:17.015
possibly even make an example
out of him and fire him.

32:17.050 --> 32:18.784
You do realize that
you're talking about blackmail.

32:18.818 --> 32:20.719
No, I'm talking
hypotheticals.

32:20.754 --> 32:23.822
But when you think about it,

32:23.857 --> 32:26.158
$30,000 really isn't that much.

32:26.192 --> 32:29.995
Not when you consider
the alternatives.

32:33.700 --> 32:35.467
Dr. Brennan,
this blunt force trauma injury

32:35.502 --> 32:37.302
to the left temporal bone
is unlike any I've ever seen.

32:37.337 --> 32:38.737
BRENNAN:
Yes.

32:38.772 --> 32:40.172
Angela already ran
the fracture pattern

32:40.206 --> 32:41.440
through the computer.

32:41.474 --> 32:43.142
It doesn't correspond

32:43.176 --> 32:45.144
to any commonly known
blunt force weapons.

32:45.178 --> 32:46.945
Which means we
should look at

32:46.980 --> 32:48.580
the crime scene photos
in case the victim was struck

32:48.615 --> 32:51.250
with an uncommon item,
like a small statue

32:51.284 --> 32:52.785
or some piece of furniture.

32:52.819 --> 32:54.386
Nothing like that will correlate

32:54.420 --> 32:55.954
to the injury in question.

32:55.989 --> 32:57.656
But you haven't even
looked at the photos.

32:57.690 --> 32:59.958
But I did closely examine

32:59.993 --> 33:03.495
the fracture to the victim's
left proximal tibia.

33:03.530 --> 33:06.698
It's an impact fracture.
So what?

33:06.733 --> 33:08.667
It's the same as a dozen others

33:08.701 --> 33:11.303
caused by the fall
down the stairs.

33:11.337 --> 33:13.238
Except the other fractures
from the stairs

33:13.273 --> 33:14.740
occurred mediolaterally.

33:14.774 --> 33:16.475
This indirect fracture

33:16.509 --> 33:18.143
was the result of
a pulled ligament.

33:18.178 --> 33:20.712
Which would only happen
if the victim had been moved.

33:20.747 --> 33:23.048
And if the victim was moved,

33:23.082 --> 33:24.516
that means that
the victim's house

33:24.551 --> 33:27.553
may not be the actual
scene of the crime.

33:27.587 --> 33:29.254
MONTENEGRO:
Hey.

33:29.289 --> 33:31.256
Where's Booth?

33:31.291 --> 33:34.126
Did you track down whoever stole
the victim's laptop?

33:34.160 --> 33:35.460
Yeah,

33:35.495 --> 33:36.895
from the IP address

33:36.930 --> 33:38.463
where this guy tried
to access the computer.

33:38.498 --> 33:42.267
Uh, his name is Sanjar Zamaani.

33:42.302 --> 33:44.369
That's the victim's cousin.

33:44.404 --> 33:46.538
(doorbell buzzes)

33:48.908 --> 33:51.109
Hey, where's the laptop?
What?

33:51.144 --> 33:52.845
I don't know what you're talking about.
No, no. I know you stole it.

33:52.879 --> 33:54.246
You tried to access it
from here.

33:54.280 --> 33:56.582
Get out!
How dare you accuse me?

33:56.616 --> 33:57.950
(grunting)

34:02.689 --> 34:05.390
Okay! Okay, I admit it.

34:05.425 --> 34:06.692
I took the computer.

34:06.726 --> 34:08.005
But I only did it
to protect him.

34:08.027 --> 34:09.428
Protect him from who?

34:09.462 --> 34:10.929
From my uncle, his father.

34:10.964 --> 34:12.965
If he looked at Darius' laptop,

34:12.998 --> 34:15.266
he would see the e-mails between
Darius and that Russian woman.

34:15.301 --> 34:16.869
Russian woman? Get up here.

34:16.902 --> 34:18.971
You knew about her
the whole time?

34:19.005 --> 34:20.873
Yes, I knew everything.

34:20.907 --> 34:23.275
Uh, the drinking, the woman,

34:23.309 --> 34:26.411
even that Darius was on
the Internet advocating for

34:26.446 --> 34:28.313
women's rights
and freedom of speech.

34:28.348 --> 34:30.482
I knew how ashamed
my uncle would be.

34:30.516 --> 34:32.717
I took the computer
so he would never find out.

34:32.752 --> 34:34.186
What would your uncle do
if he found out?

34:34.219 --> 34:35.387
NAMAZI:
Sanjar.

34:35.420 --> 34:37.489
Agent Booth,

34:37.523 --> 34:38.857
we need to get you out of here.

34:38.891 --> 34:40.425
Someone has called
into the station

34:40.460 --> 34:41.860
and told the general

34:41.895 --> 34:43.027
about everything
you have been doing.

34:43.062 --> 34:45.063
How much time?
One hour at most.

34:45.098 --> 34:46.364
After that, you
and your friends

34:46.399 --> 34:48.132
could be thrown in prison.

34:53.844 --> 34:56.179
Are you into the victim's computer?
Uh, yeah.

34:56.214 --> 34:58.749
But the bad news is, Booth
says we only have 15 minutes

34:58.784 --> 35:00.685
before the police shut
this whole thing down.

35:00.719 --> 35:02.187
Hey, what about
the cousin's claim

35:02.221 --> 35:03.688
that Darius was working

35:03.722 --> 35:05.623
to make Iran
a democracy?

35:05.658 --> 35:07.025
Well, that seems to be true.

35:07.059 --> 35:08.760
The computer was set up
to get around

35:08.794 --> 35:12.030
all the government filters
so he can access Facebook,

35:12.064 --> 35:13.531
Twitter, Tumblr...

35:13.566 --> 35:14.766
The government's pretty strict,

35:14.800 --> 35:16.267
so it's certainly a motive.

35:16.302 --> 35:17.802
You know, his father is
part of the government.

35:17.837 --> 35:19.337
Darius would have been
an embarrassment.

35:19.371 --> 35:21.139
Wait a minute.

35:21.173 --> 35:22.774
You think that
his father killed him?

35:22.808 --> 35:24.943
I'm just saying...
Well, then,

35:24.977 --> 35:27.712
why kidnap Arastoo
to help solve the crime?

35:27.746 --> 35:29.180
Maybe he just wanted
to find out if there was

35:29.215 --> 35:31.749
enough evidence
to tie him to the murder.

35:31.784 --> 35:33.218
And as soon as they
started finding evidence,

35:33.252 --> 35:34.619
he shut down the investigation.

35:34.653 --> 35:37.422
Yeah.

35:37.456 --> 35:39.324
Mr. Vaziri, take a look at

35:39.358 --> 35:43.528
the V-shaped fracture
to the left tibia.

35:43.562 --> 35:45.563
I've looked at him over and
over. What does it matter?

35:45.598 --> 35:46.965
Because he was killed
on a staircase.

35:46.999 --> 35:48.199
BOOTH:
Oh, come on, Bones,

35:48.234 --> 35:49.467
even you said he was killed

35:49.502 --> 35:50.768
and was brought
back to his own house

35:50.803 --> 35:52.270
and pushed
down the stairs.

35:52.304 --> 35:53.638
The fractures weren't caused
by a weapon.

35:53.672 --> 35:55.507
They were caused
by falling against steps,

35:55.541 --> 35:57.542
but not the rounded steps
at the victim's house.

35:57.576 --> 35:58.943
These had
squared-off edges.

35:58.978 --> 36:00.945
Wait, so he was killed
on one staircase,

36:00.980 --> 36:02.280
then later pushed down a second?
It's the perfect way

36:02.314 --> 36:03.781
for the killer to
cover up the crime.

36:03.816 --> 36:05.950
Also, look at the angle
of each strike.

36:05.985 --> 36:08.853
The victim didn't just
tumble down the stairs.

36:08.888 --> 36:10.989
He rolled
in a curved trajectory.

36:11.023 --> 36:13.458
So we're looking
for a grand staircase

36:13.492 --> 36:14.993
like the one
in the victim's house.

36:15.027 --> 36:17.462
But with steps made from
something harder than wood.

36:17.496 --> 36:19.163
The bank where Darius worked!

36:19.198 --> 36:20.832
The-the, the staircase
is made out of marble

36:20.866 --> 36:22.166
and it's curved.
Would that cause the injuries?

36:22.201 --> 36:23.635
Well, yes. Yes.

36:23.669 --> 36:25.403
I'll do the calculations

36:25.437 --> 36:27.839
and send you
the measurements to match.

36:27.873 --> 36:30.308
Hey. I was just watching
you guys in my office.

36:30.342 --> 36:32.810
Did you say something
about "bank," Booth?

36:32.845 --> 36:35.613
Because I just decrypted
something on Darius' computer.

36:35.648 --> 36:40.518
Have you guys come across
someone named Omid Turan?

36:40.553 --> 36:42.787
That's the president
of the bank.

36:42.821 --> 36:44.255
Uh, well,
he's also an embezzler.

36:44.290 --> 36:46.524
Darius was compiling evidence
against him.

36:46.559 --> 36:48.192
So Omid is our killer.
We got him.

36:48.227 --> 36:50.929
He must be the one that called
the police and shut us down.

36:50.963 --> 36:52.230
(pounding on door)
MAN: Police!

36:52.264 --> 36:53.565
(shouting in Farsi)

36:54.800 --> 36:57.068
Police! (shouting in Farsi)

37:02.775 --> 37:03.775
Oh, my God.

37:03.809 --> 37:05.276
Booth!

37:05.311 --> 37:08.012
(speaking Farsi)

37:08.047 --> 37:09.480
Hooshmand, what are you doing here?
My men and I

37:09.515 --> 37:11.182
are here to protect
you from the police.

37:11.216 --> 37:13.585
I told Danny I would keep
you safe, so I keep you safe.

37:13.619 --> 37:15.853
Was it worth it?

37:15.888 --> 37:17.322
We can finally
arrest a murderer.

37:17.356 --> 37:19.457
Is that worth it? Huh?

37:23.329 --> 37:25.096
All right. Thank you.

37:25.130 --> 37:27.732
♪ ♪

37:38.677 --> 37:41.946
SAROYAN: This is easily the best tea
I have ever had.

37:41.981 --> 37:43.448
VAZIRI:
The secret is rose petals.

37:43.482 --> 37:44.816
They put a pinch in every cup.

37:44.850 --> 37:46.384
Nice.

37:46.418 --> 37:48.853
Well, I expect you to make this
for me every morning.

37:48.887 --> 37:50.755
I will send you some.

37:50.789 --> 37:52.924
So, Mr. Namazi, I have to ask,

37:52.958 --> 37:55.126
uh, now that you know more
about your son,

37:55.160 --> 37:57.595
do you still disapprove
of the life he was living?

37:57.630 --> 37:59.530
Yes.

37:59.565 --> 38:01.566
Because in the
eyes of Allah,

38:01.600 --> 38:04.335
Darius was not a good Muslim.

38:04.370 --> 38:05.903
I still mourn his loss

38:05.938 --> 38:08.072
because...

38:09.875 --> 38:12.644
...I loved my son.

38:15.214 --> 38:17.815
I know this
trip was...

38:17.850 --> 38:20.318
difficult,
to say the least, but...

38:20.352 --> 38:22.553
if you allow me,

38:22.588 --> 38:24.656
I would like
a chance to apologize

38:24.690 --> 38:27.425
and show you my gratitude.

38:27.459 --> 38:29.794
That's, uh...
really very kind of you,

38:29.828 --> 38:31.796
but you see,
we have a plane to catch.

38:31.830 --> 38:33.998
And I'm sure you understand that
we-we don't want to miss that,

38:34.033 --> 38:35.266
so...

38:35.300 --> 38:37.168
Hooshmand should
be here soon, so...

38:37.202 --> 38:39.137
Actually, uh,
we'll meet you at the airport.

38:39.171 --> 38:41.105
What, you want to risk
getting into more trouble?

38:41.140 --> 38:43.708
No, we've got to say
good-bye to his brother.

38:47.046 --> 38:50.515
HAMID: <i>I cannot believe</i>
<i>you are here in Tehran.</i>

38:50.549 --> 38:51.949
And you really came all the way
just for this fool?

38:51.984 --> 38:54.352
Hey, be nice.
(laughs)

38:54.386 --> 38:56.020
All I am saying--
I feel like she could do better.

38:56.055 --> 38:57.155
SAROYAN:
Thanks.

38:57.189 --> 38:58.990
I'll-I'll keep that in mind.

38:59.024 --> 39:01.292
He did make sure I lived,

39:01.326 --> 39:02.527
so maybe he's not

39:02.561 --> 39:04.028
that big of a fool.

39:04.063 --> 39:06.564
High praise.

39:06.598 --> 39:09.767
Maybe the next time I see you,

39:09.802 --> 39:12.003
it's in the United States.

39:12.037 --> 39:14.472
Say, at a wedding.

39:15.908 --> 39:18.409
I would like that.

39:21.547 --> 39:23.514
Hamid, I'm sorry,
but we're gonna have to leave

39:23.549 --> 39:25.283
if we're going to make it
to the airport.

39:25.317 --> 39:28.352
Then let's make sure
this moment lasts

39:28.387 --> 39:31.189
until the next time, huh?

39:38.731 --> 39:41.933
(crickets chirping)

39:41.967 --> 39:44.102
(phone ringing)

39:44.136 --> 39:45.269
Hello.

39:45.304 --> 39:46.671
Hey, it's me.

39:46.705 --> 39:47.972
BRENNAN:
Is everything okay?

39:48.006 --> 39:49.407
Did you give Jimmy the money?

39:49.441 --> 39:51.476
I'm meeting him
in a half an hour.

39:51.510 --> 39:53.111
Listen, I wanted to let you know

39:53.145 --> 39:55.279
that I talked
to Booth's ex-bookie,

39:55.314 --> 39:56.380
Jason Samuels.

39:56.415 --> 39:58.182
Does Booth owe him money,
as well?

39:58.217 --> 39:59.617
No. Samuels said
that Booth called him

39:59.651 --> 40:00.952
and tried to place a bet,

40:00.986 --> 40:02.553
but Samuels refused to take it,

40:02.588 --> 40:04.722
which is probably why
Booth turned to Jimmy.

40:04.757 --> 40:05.957
The reason why Booth did

40:05.991 --> 40:07.592
what he did
is not important to me.

40:07.626 --> 40:09.494
All I care
is that the debt is paid

40:09.528 --> 40:11.596
and that Christine
and I are safe.

40:11.630 --> 40:13.397
All right.
Consider it done.

40:13.432 --> 40:15.099
(door opens) Oh, I have to go.
Booth is here.

40:15.134 --> 40:17.468
Thank you, Aubrey.
BOOTH: Hello?

40:17.503 --> 40:20.004
Hi.
Hi.

40:20.038 --> 40:23.007
It's... it's good to see you.

40:23.041 --> 40:24.375
Oh, yeah, so good to see you.

40:24.409 --> 40:25.643
Look at that.

40:25.677 --> 40:27.278
Where's Christine?
She sleeping?

40:27.312 --> 40:28.613
No.

40:28.647 --> 40:30.782
I mean, I-I don't know.

40:30.816 --> 40:32.850
She's with my dad.
Oh!

40:32.885 --> 40:34.418
Well, that's good.
A little time for ourselves.

40:34.453 --> 40:35.887
Stop.

40:35.921 --> 40:37.922
First, I want
to say

40:37.956 --> 40:40.424
how proud I am of you.

40:40.459 --> 40:42.126
For helping
Arastoo and Cam

40:42.161 --> 40:45.163
and your bravery

40:45.197 --> 40:46.998
in confronting the authorities

40:47.032 --> 40:49.667
in the Islamic Republic.

40:51.837 --> 40:53.304
Everything okay, Bones?

40:54.606 --> 40:57.108
No.

40:57.142 --> 40:59.410
Before you left,
you asked me a question

40:59.444 --> 41:03.114
about a surgical procedure
common to baseball players.

41:05.050 --> 41:07.852
Um, okay... why are we talking
about baseball?

41:07.886 --> 41:09.187
I just... I just got home.

41:09.221 --> 41:10.521
Let's make a drink
or something.

41:10.556 --> 41:11.756
I need to know
why you asked me

41:11.757 --> 41:12.990
that question.

41:13.025 --> 41:14.292
What? Come on.

41:14.326 --> 41:16.427
Are you serious?
That was like a week ago.

41:16.461 --> 41:18.729
Please, just answer
my question, Booth.

41:18.764 --> 41:19.997
I don't know.

41:20.032 --> 41:22.200
Just was, uh...

41:22.234 --> 41:23.701
just wanted to have
a conversation, you know?

41:23.735 --> 41:24.969
I was curious.

41:25.003 --> 41:27.271
Are you gambling?

41:27.306 --> 41:29.774
I need you
to tell me the truth.

41:29.808 --> 41:33.044
Because without the truth,
we have nothing.

41:33.078 --> 41:37.548
So, please... are you?

41:37.583 --> 41:40.484
No, I'm not.

41:42.688 --> 41:44.722
Jimmy, your bookie, came here.

41:44.756 --> 41:46.390
I paid him
everything you owe.

41:46.425 --> 41:47.725
Wait. Jimmy?

41:47.759 --> 41:49.260
What-what do you mean?
You paid Jimmy?

41:49.294 --> 41:51.028
I need you to leave.
No, no.

41:51.063 --> 41:52.830
No, no. Look, I'm sorry.
What happened, it was just,

41:52.865 --> 41:54.565
it was just a mistake,
all right?

41:54.600 --> 41:56.567
Look, I made one bet. That was it.
No, it wasn't!

41:56.602 --> 41:58.836
Why are you still lying?!
I'm not lying, okay? Look...

41:58.871 --> 42:00.151
All right, look,
I'm sorry, okay?

42:00.172 --> 42:01.672
Let me fix this.
Bones, please.

42:01.707 --> 42:03.641
Just... let me fix this, okay?
I'm sorry.

42:03.675 --> 42:05.276
I-I messed up.

42:05.310 --> 42:07.545
I-I wasn't thinking.
Just hear me out on this.

42:07.579 --> 42:09.513
I'm sorry. Look at me.

42:09.548 --> 42:10.915
Look, I love you.

42:10.949 --> 42:12.416
I don't believe you.

42:12.451 --> 42:15.319
Not now.

42:18.957 --> 42:21.025
Go.
