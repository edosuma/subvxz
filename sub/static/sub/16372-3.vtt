WEBVTT

00:23.040 --> 00:25.032
Cameras online.

00:25.560 --> 00:29.110
<i>- Requesting permission to proceed.
- Permission granted, team leader.</i>

00:45.840 --> 00:48.992
<i>Unit two.
Routine northern perimeter check.</i>

01:03.640 --> 01:05.438
We've got movement on the south...

01:07.520 --> 01:09.034
Say again.

01:09.640 --> 01:11.359
Unit three?

01:11.640 --> 01:13.518
Unit three, come back.

01:14.520 --> 01:16.239
Unit two, respond.

01:16.400 --> 01:19.120
<i>Unit two. Unit two, respond.</i>

01:29.000 --> 01:31.834
That's the last one.
Set the charges. We're out in 90.

01:45.400 --> 01:46.436
<i>Thirty seconds.</i>

01:51.880 --> 01:53.792
In the beginning there was light.

01:54.240 --> 01:57.312
Then I said, "Let there be darkness."

02:15.640 --> 02:18.280
We have no idea where she is
or what he's doing with her.

02:18.440 --> 02:21.080
Kirk thinks Agnes is his
granddaughter, he won't hurt her.

02:21.280 --> 02:23.590
You really think Kirk
is your biological father?

02:23.760 --> 02:26.355
I don't know what to believe
but it's possible.

02:26.520 --> 02:27.795
- She had a vision.
- A memory.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.311
- Of being at that house.
- When you were 4. Is that reliable?

02:31.480 --> 02:34.518
Alexander Kirk shot up a church
full of federal agents to get you.

02:34.680 --> 02:37.479
You almost died because of him.
Not exactly father of the year.

02:37.680 --> 02:41.196
I agree, he had a reason for going
that far, and it wasn't a family reunion.

02:41.360 --> 02:44.671
Kirk said he was doing what it took to
get his daughter away from Reddington.

02:44.840 --> 02:46.559
Look how far we went
to do the same.

02:46.720 --> 02:49.679
- Where are you on finding him?
- We're searching, believe me.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.389
Kirk's got properties
all over the world.

02:52.560 --> 02:55.553
Private houses.
Commercial real estate, planes, boats.

02:55.720 --> 02:58.713
- Is this the evidence from his place?
- Some of it.

02:58.880 --> 03:01.236
Some? This is our case.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.631
Not anymore.
We're coordinating a search...

03:03.800 --> 03:06.474
...with over a dozen governments.
Main Justice is running point.

03:06.640 --> 03:08.438
- We need to see everything.
- Not gonna happen.

03:08.600 --> 03:11.638
- Ressler, why not?
- You lost your security clearance, Keen.

03:11.800 --> 03:15.999
Technically, both of you guys
are victims in this case.

03:22.160 --> 03:25.471
You know what, dig in.
As it is I'm violating federal code.

03:25.680 --> 03:28.275
I could go to jail
for even showing you what I have.

03:33.440 --> 03:34.920
You're back.

03:52.120 --> 03:53.440
I'm so glad you're okay.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.036
Look.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.033
I'm sorry.

04:00.640 --> 04:03.519
- I never wanted to hurt anybody.
- You didn't care who you hurt.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.996
- Samar.
- No. It's okay.

04:06.320 --> 04:09.154
We knew what pain it would cause...

04:09.320 --> 04:11.789
...and we did it anyway
to protect our daughter.

04:12.800 --> 04:17.079
I know you may not accept it,
but I hope you can at least understand.

04:20.640 --> 04:22.279
Reddington.

04:22.440 --> 04:25.000
You should know I'm requesting
a transfer. I won't stay.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.593
This is where you wanted to meet?

04:35.000 --> 04:38.516
I wonder what poor soul Mr. Kaplan
buried down there.

04:38.680 --> 04:40.592
Where is Mr. Kaplan?

04:43.440 --> 04:46.114
I understand why you ran.

04:46.280 --> 04:51.116
You believe your family's in danger
because of who I am.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.715
But what you don't grasp
is you're also in danger...

04:53.880 --> 04:55.075
...because of who you are.

04:55.960 --> 04:58.919
Alexander Kirk says he's my father.

04:59.840 --> 05:02.753
I'm doing everything in my power
to find Agnes...

05:02.920 --> 05:05.310
- ...and bring her home safely.
- Do you have leads?

05:06.440 --> 05:07.715
- Yes.
- What?

05:08.280 --> 05:11.398
- Who?
- I'll be handling it on my own.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.439
I know you feel betrayed.

05:17.400 --> 05:20.040
Samar and Aram feel betrayed,
everyone feels betrayed.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.475
But...

05:22.560 --> 05:25.359
...my daughter is missing.

05:25.560 --> 05:28.519
And if you have any idea how
to find her, you've gotta tell me.

05:28.720 --> 05:29.836
No, I don't.

05:34.880 --> 05:38.669
I expected Kirk to go underground
after the FBI's raid at his estate.

05:38.840 --> 05:41.480
He didn't. I have it on good authority,
he reached out...

05:41.640 --> 05:46.032
...to a uniquely inventive young man
named Miles McGrath.

05:46.240 --> 05:47.993
Who is that?

05:48.200 --> 05:51.034
He's a venture capitalist of sorts,
for criminals.

05:51.240 --> 05:54.790
What those in the tech industry
might call an "incubator."

05:55.000 --> 05:58.277
You really believe if we find McGrath,
he'll lead us to Kirk?

05:58.440 --> 06:01.592
Not us. Me.

06:02.640 --> 06:04.472
Miles McGrath was a child prodigy.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.916
He wrote the code
for OnScreen at Princeton.

06:07.080 --> 06:10.118
OnScreen? It's a multi-billion dollar
social media platform.

06:10.280 --> 06:13.637
He founded it. Within a couple of years,
the board of directors...

06:13.800 --> 06:16.634
...found he was a high-functioning
sociopath. Pushed him out.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.918
He sued them, won the suit
for over 100 million dollars.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.072
Turned his back on
legitimate business.

06:22.240 --> 06:24.391
He invested his money
in a new business.

06:24.560 --> 06:27.598
- Incubating crimes.
- You mean like an angel investor?

06:27.760 --> 06:30.480
Criminals come to him,
pitch their business plan.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.758
If he likes it, he invests his money
for a cut of the profits.

06:33.920 --> 06:35.149
That's an amazing idea.

06:35.320 --> 06:38.597
I mean it's horrible,
but it's an amazing concept.

06:38.760 --> 06:41.480
Okay, so, what's McGrath's
connection to Alexander Kirk?

06:41.640 --> 06:43.518
I don't know. All Reddington told me...

06:43.680 --> 06:47.230
...was he's staying at the Sovereign
Royale tonight on business in London.

06:47.400 --> 06:50.598
Reddington is flying over, hopes to
drop in on him in the morning.

06:50.800 --> 06:52.632
So that's it, we just wait?

06:52.800 --> 06:55.599
What if he checks out
before Reddington gets there?

06:55.760 --> 06:59.959
Get me the Bureau's attachÃ© in London.
I want eyes on McGrath. Now.

07:14.320 --> 07:15.549
We destroyed the place.

07:15.720 --> 07:18.599
The city won't have full power restored
for at least five days.

07:18.760 --> 07:19.876
All we needed was three.

07:20.080 --> 07:21.833
- Construction?
- Completed.

07:22.040 --> 07:24.600
Halbeck thinks we can keep
the casualties under a dozen.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.034
Sweet.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.635
Think we're ready to roll
into phase two.

07:30.440 --> 07:32.113
Rear entrance.

07:45.600 --> 07:46.636
He's not our target.

07:49.640 --> 07:52.838
I'll have these sent to the FBI.
Maybe there's a connection.

07:59.280 --> 08:00.350
Hey!

08:47.280 --> 08:48.634
<i>What did you do, Harold?</i>

08:48.840 --> 08:51.514
I asked New Scotland Yard
to keep eyes on McGrath. No more.

08:51.680 --> 08:53.990
Now three families
have to bury their loved ones.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.994
I'm aware of what happened,
no need to make it worse.

08:57.160 --> 08:59.516
<i>Maybe if you were more communicative
we could have avoided this.</i>

08:59.720 --> 09:02.633
I was very clear with Elizabeth,
you were not to get involved.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.075
<i>- Where's McGrath?
- Who knows?</i>

09:04.240 --> 09:07.631
He checked out of the Sovereign Grand
after those detectives were killed.

09:07.800 --> 09:10.156
Thanks to you, Harold,
he's on high alert...

09:10.360 --> 09:12.716
<i>...and we just lost my best lead
on Kirk and Agnes.</i>

09:12.880 --> 09:16.510
Maybe not. When he was killed, one
of the detectives was in the process...

09:16.680 --> 09:19.639
- ...of uploading a photo to NSY, London.
- Who's the photo of?

09:19.800 --> 09:23.635
We don't know yet. The upload was
interrupted mid-stream by the killer.

09:23.840 --> 09:26.639
<i>Data was incomplete.
Aram's looking at it now.</i>

09:26.800 --> 09:29.599
Looks like we're involved,
whether you like it or not.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.313
How's it going with the photo?

09:33.360 --> 09:36.797
It's not. I tried to recreate it
using a hex editor...

09:36.960 --> 09:39.919
...and a customized bit of software
to carve it off the drive.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.196
Of course you did.

09:41.800 --> 09:45.350
But there wasn't enough
data to run...

09:45.560 --> 09:49.270
...so I tried a new ISM algorithm.

09:50.560 --> 09:51.789
This is all I got.

09:57.640 --> 09:58.915
Oh, my God.

09:59.240 --> 10:01.471
- That's it.
- What's it?

10:01.800 --> 10:02.950
Symmetry.

10:03.160 --> 10:05.117
Some people's faces
are symmetrical.

10:05.280 --> 10:06.634
- Yours isn't but...
- Thank you.

10:06.800 --> 10:10.919
No. No, no, I just mean your right eye is
a twinch larger than your left which is...

10:11.680 --> 10:14.639
- It's adorable. Plus, your chin kind of...
- Your idea?

10:15.200 --> 10:17.510
Right. Symmetry.

10:17.720 --> 10:18.870
Just, here...

10:19.040 --> 10:20.156
Watch this.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.472
All we're asking for is an update here.
Okay, we're in the dark.

10:23.680 --> 10:26.752
Surely, there is something
that you can tell us.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.752
I know it's hard to hear...

10:28.920 --> 10:31.799
...but the Bureau
doesn't have any actionable intel...

10:31.960 --> 10:33.792
...on the whereabouts of Kirk or Agnes.

10:33.960 --> 10:35.713
- Why don't you get some?
- Tom, please.

10:35.880 --> 10:39.317
- No, she works for the Bureau.
- And the Bureau is doing all we can.

10:39.480 --> 10:41.915
Agent Savino is leading
a team of agents...

10:42.120 --> 10:45.352
...and combing through all evidence
confiscated from Kirk's residence.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.751
The residence in Cape Breton,
where you lost him?

10:48.440 --> 10:50.079
I'm not sure that's fair.

10:50.240 --> 10:53.756
The FBI failed to locate Mr. Kirk,
as did the regional police.

10:53.960 --> 10:56.031
- Do you have any idea what this is like?
- Tom!

10:56.200 --> 10:58.795
She was targeted, accused
of being a Russian agent...

10:58.960 --> 11:01.600
...forced to go on the run,
only to be victimized again.

11:01.800 --> 11:04.269
I'm sorry. I just need a minute.

11:04.440 --> 11:05.476
Liz.

11:06.560 --> 11:07.960
Liz.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.039
It's okay.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.317
Mark Savino's office, please.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.631
<i>- Savino.
- Mark, hi, this is Diane...</i>

11:24.800 --> 11:26.280
...in Gerald Walker's office.

11:26.440 --> 11:30.434
Listen, Gerry just got a surprise visit
from Tom and Elizabeth Keen.

11:30.600 --> 11:35.117
<i>And well, they're very interested to know
where we are with the whole case.</i>

11:35.280 --> 11:37.875
<i>- I'm kind of in the weeds here.
- Look, it can't wait.</i>

11:38.040 --> 11:41.238
<i>They're very upset, and she asked
to speak with you directly.</i>

11:41.400 --> 11:43.551
<i>I told them to wait
in conference room nine.</i>

11:43.760 --> 11:46.434
Fine, tell Gerry I'm on my way.

13:00.360 --> 13:01.396
Let's just go.

13:01.560 --> 13:05.156
- Liz, we came here for answers...
- I'm sure he's given us all he can.

13:05.680 --> 13:08.149
- Thank you so much for your time.
- I'm sorry.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.351
You and I aren't done here.

13:16.960 --> 13:19.111
- Find anything?
- About Agnes, maybe.

13:19.280 --> 13:20.794
About my mother, definitely.

13:22.320 --> 13:24.357
Got your message. You cracked it.

13:24.520 --> 13:26.910
We cracked it. Symmetry.

13:27.080 --> 13:28.719
That was the key here, look.

13:28.880 --> 13:31.952
Okay, this is everything
I can recover from the original data.

13:32.160 --> 13:35.198
About half a face
and with lousy resolution.

13:35.360 --> 13:38.000
But if we mirror the image.

13:38.200 --> 13:41.398
And then make a few tweaks
to connect the halves.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.919
You get one complete face.

13:44.080 --> 13:47.790
A completely symmetrical face,
which nobody actually has.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.520
It gave us enough comparison
points to run a search.

13:50.720 --> 13:53.952
Now we have to hope one of the hits
that came back is our suspect.

13:54.120 --> 13:55.190
How many?

13:55.360 --> 13:56.635
Fourteen.

13:56.800 --> 13:59.554
Three are dead.
Five are in prison so...

14:00.360 --> 14:02.192
Our guy's one of the remaining six.

14:04.520 --> 14:06.512
<i>You ever play Call of Duty?</i>

14:06.960 --> 14:08.235
You should.

14:08.400 --> 14:09.436
It's cool.

14:09.600 --> 14:12.240
I assume you didn't come
all the way here with good news.

14:12.400 --> 14:14.153
That depends.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.516
Are two Scotland Yard
detectives watching...

14:16.680 --> 14:18.319
...my hotel in London good news?

14:18.480 --> 14:20.278
Well, two dead detectives now.

14:20.640 --> 14:22.518
- Watching you?
- Don't know.

14:22.680 --> 14:27.038
But I can tell you one of them snapped a
few photos of your man Bradley outside.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.318
<i>You think they got enough
to make an ID? Let them.</i>

14:30.480 --> 14:33.712
I did two tours in Fallujah with Bradley.
He's as loyal as they come.

14:33.880 --> 14:35.837
Even if they find him, he won't talk.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.231
You understand
why I can't take that chance.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.230
Now, hang on,
Dean Bradley's like a brother to me.

14:41.480 --> 14:45.110
- And we need him for this job.
- Nice catch.

14:45.320 --> 14:47.676
Those are quick reflexes.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.480
I was never very athletic.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.634
I don't want him hurt.

14:52.440 --> 14:53.715
<i>My point...</i>

14:53.920 --> 14:56.355
...is there's a reason
why your reflexes are so good.

14:57.480 --> 15:00.200
See, you're a technician.
You're an operative.

15:00.760 --> 15:03.320
An instrument of a larger plan.

15:03.480 --> 15:05.915
I, on the other hand, am a strategist.

15:06.080 --> 15:09.118
You whip that can at me,
and I'll catch it.

15:09.280 --> 15:13.797
But only because I calculated the risk
that someone might throw it in advance.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.834
So why don't you leave
the risk assessment to me?

15:17.000 --> 15:20.835
And where am I supposed to find
a replacement so late in the game?

15:21.480 --> 15:24.757
Not my problem.

15:25.840 --> 15:28.116
But you'd better think of something.

15:28.480 --> 15:31.279
I don't intend to lose my investment.

16:13.480 --> 16:15.073
Reddington, we hit a dead end.

16:15.280 --> 16:18.079
<i>I gather Aram couldn't identify
the person in the photo.</i>

16:18.240 --> 16:19.276
Actually, he did.

16:19.440 --> 16:22.353
Someone got to him before we could
interview him. Dean Bradley.

16:22.520 --> 16:25.035
<i>An ex-SEAL, two tours in Iraq,
highly decorated.</i>

16:25.200 --> 16:26.429
<i>He was shot while jogging.</i>

16:26.600 --> 16:29.957
I told you.
I need long-reach matches.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.759
The black guy, where is he?

16:32.240 --> 16:34.277
- Dembe.
- Yeah, Dembe. Where is he?

16:36.920 --> 16:40.675
Get this, we searched his car.
Found a helmet camera and dive gear.

16:40.840 --> 16:42.877
Not entirely unusual, he was a SEAL.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.751
<i>Well, maybe he wasn't
as retired as he let on.</i>

16:45.920 --> 16:47.479
<i>A few nights ago near Savannah...</i>

16:47.640 --> 16:50.838
...a power station was hit by a four-man
team wearing that equipment.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.275
<i>Any witnesses left alive?</i>

16:52.440 --> 16:55.797
None. Guards never saw it coming.
My guess is they came out of the water.

16:55.960 --> 16:58.191
<i>- Four frogmen.
- Yeah.</i>

16:58.360 --> 17:00.192
<i>- Interesting.
- How so?</i>

17:00.360 --> 17:03.512
I know an ex-SEAL commander
recruited some former colleagues...

17:03.680 --> 17:05.478
<i>...formed an elite heist crew.</i>

17:05.640 --> 17:09.599
I hired them once to get back a
shamefully expensive Patek Philippe...

17:09.760 --> 17:12.798
...I foolishly left on a nightstand
in Ras Al Khaimah...

17:12.960 --> 17:17.272
...after a dalliance
with a lovely but very...

17:17.440 --> 17:19.352
Oh, never mind.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.319
Where are we at?

17:23.560 --> 17:26.916
Don't tell me you lost
that damn watch again.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.511
Johan. Truth be told...

17:30.680 --> 17:33.752
...I traded it for a bowl of pongol
and a slightly used Ruger...

17:33.920 --> 17:36.310
...after a particularly
rough night in Bengaluru.

17:36.480 --> 17:39.757
But I will forever be grateful
to you for retrieving it.

17:39.920 --> 17:41.400
Listen, pal, I have a job.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.075
Can it wait a day?
I've got a deal going down tomorrow.

17:44.240 --> 17:47.119
No, it can't, I'll double
whatever you're being paid.

17:47.280 --> 17:51.160
Come on, Johan, burn the deal,
help out an old friend.

17:51.440 --> 17:52.874
Would if I could, Red.

17:54.280 --> 17:55.919
But I've got a partner in this one.

17:56.080 --> 17:57.514
Biggest mistake I ever made.

17:57.920 --> 18:00.230
- Sounds like Martin and Lewis.
- Who?

18:00.400 --> 18:04.110
<i>3 Ring Circus, The Stooge,
Sailor Beware? Martin and Lewis.</i>

18:05.160 --> 18:09.916
- What the hell you talking about?
- Partnerships can be very rough.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.998
You know, B.J. Simpson and I
started a lawn-mowing business...

18:18.200 --> 18:21.557
...in the summer of '72, bagging,
hedging, the whole ball of wax.

18:21.720 --> 18:26.397
One day, I'm out rototilling
Pat Hunt's garden...

18:26.600 --> 18:29.718
...I go in for a bottle of pop,
must have been 110.

18:29.920 --> 18:31.957
And there's B.J.
in the sunken living room...

18:32.120 --> 18:35.192
...shoes off, feet on the couch,
eating a fried bologna sandwich...

18:35.360 --> 18:38.194
...watching Mike Douglas.
Mike Douglas, can you imagine?

18:38.360 --> 18:41.000
- I quit that day.
- Who are Martin and Lewis?

18:42.440 --> 18:44.079
Point is...

18:44.320 --> 18:47.074
- ...I haven't had a partner since.
- Lucky man.

18:47.240 --> 18:49.835
Guy I'm in bed with is nuts.
Killed one of my best men.

18:54.520 --> 18:57.080
Johan, you should walk away.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.596
I'd help you out if I could,
offer a man...

19:01.640 --> 19:03.632
...but this sounds like a mess.
A real mess.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.917
I am so sorry.

19:08.120 --> 19:11.238
Anyway, I've taken
too much of your time already.

19:12.640 --> 19:14.438
Call me when you
get things sorted out.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.198
Hey...

19:20.800 --> 19:23.713
...you seriously think you can get
a man on such short notice?

19:24.960 --> 19:26.917
Depends on my cut.

19:29.840 --> 19:30.910
Time for our feeding?

19:31.080 --> 19:34.835
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
He's here for your protection.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.036
Agnes?

19:38.040 --> 19:42.034
We're making progress. I told you
Miles McGrath is an incubator...

19:42.240 --> 19:45.039
...that he's our link to Alexander Kirk.

19:45.240 --> 19:50.474
Turns out he's been incubating a crime
with a man named Johan Halbeck.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.040
- What's that?
- That's you.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.953
Halbeck's running a mission tomorrow.

19:54.120 --> 19:57.352
He needs a man with your expertise.

19:57.680 --> 19:58.830
And you volunteered me?

19:59.360 --> 20:01.431
Desperate times.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.195
Staying close to Halbeck
will lead to McGrath...

20:04.760 --> 20:09.915
...and as a bonus, the FBI can stop
whatever crime they're planning.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.116
Study date?

20:12.040 --> 20:15.397
This is what the FBI confiscated
from Kirk's estate.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.359
Anything interesting?

20:17.720 --> 20:20.189
Yeah. My mother's journal.

20:20.760 --> 20:22.399
She talks about you.

20:22.560 --> 20:23.880
About the affair.

20:24.680 --> 20:26.831
I'm up to the part
where she writes about you...

20:27.000 --> 20:29.310
...pressuring her to leave her husband.

20:29.800 --> 20:32.076
Halbeck will have questions.

20:32.240 --> 20:34.391
If he senses
you're not who you say you are...

20:34.560 --> 20:37.155
- ...he'll dispose of you.
- Yeah, I know the drill.

20:53.360 --> 20:54.430
Check, can you hear me?

20:55.000 --> 20:56.559
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

20:59.920 --> 21:01.479
<i>Willem Eckervelt.</i>

21:01.640 --> 21:03.791
Reddington says you were a MARSOF.

21:03.960 --> 21:05.599
Six years.

21:05.920 --> 21:08.674
Started off in Mazar-e Sharif
as part of the oh-five ISAF.

21:08.840 --> 21:11.196
Sent to provide security
during the Afghan elections.

21:11.360 --> 21:15.559
- Went to Pol-e Khomri...
- With the reconstruction team?

21:16.560 --> 21:19.200
Yeah. Four months.

21:19.360 --> 21:21.556
<i>Then a few of us were shipped off
to Deh Rashan.</i>

21:21.720 --> 21:23.040
What province is that?

21:23.600 --> 21:24.636
Uruzgan.

21:25.960 --> 21:27.360
He's good.

21:31.080 --> 21:34.039
Turn-ons include redheads
and long walks on the beach.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.112
You guys looking for a soldier...

21:36.360 --> 21:37.874
...or a date?

21:42.640 --> 21:44.074
Fair enough.

21:45.720 --> 21:48.997
What are you, 180 soaking wet?

21:49.200 --> 21:50.873
<i>How do I know
you can handle yourself?</i>

21:51.080 --> 21:53.117
<i>Because Reddington says so.</i>

21:53.280 --> 21:54.350
Maybe.

21:54.520 --> 21:57.558
But Reddington wouldn't mind
if Janowski here kicks the tires.

22:04.880 --> 22:06.997
Okay. I got nothing.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.152
Signal is down. Signal is down.

22:11.880 --> 22:13.712
- What do you wanna do?
- I promised to trust him.

22:13.880 --> 22:15.439
He made me swear not to interfere.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.034
All right, Aram, roll backup.

22:21.200 --> 22:22.953
We can't let him get beat to death.

22:46.560 --> 22:48.472
Clever boy.

22:55.600 --> 22:58.832
Oh, thank God. Aram, hold backup.

22:59.320 --> 23:02.438
Well, Mr. Eckervelt,
you got yourself a job.

23:02.600 --> 23:04.637
Tomorrow, 7 a.m.

23:24.640 --> 23:25.790
Heel.

23:46.560 --> 23:48.836
<i>Seeing Masha with Constantin...</i>

23:49.000 --> 23:51.435
<i>...makes me think of my own father.</i>

23:51.600 --> 23:55.355
<i>I wonder what he would say now
about the choices I've made.</i>

23:55.560 --> 24:00.237
<i>Look at me, in love with the man
I was sent to seduce and betray.</i>

24:00.400 --> 24:01.675
<i>An American.</i>

24:01.840 --> 24:04.912
<i>Raymond wants me to run,
take Masha and disappear with him.</i>

24:05.080 --> 24:07.231
<i>But how could I do that to her?</i>

24:07.400 --> 24:09.119
<i>She's my entire life.</i>

24:09.880 --> 24:11.360
<i>She's everything.</i>

24:26.680 --> 24:27.830
Was I asleep?

24:29.440 --> 24:31.238
Liz, you okay?

24:36.680 --> 24:39.434
Reddington didn't just have an affair
with my mother.

24:44.360 --> 24:46.238
She was assigned to him.

24:46.960 --> 24:49.156
To be in his life.

24:50.080 --> 24:52.356
The way you were assigned
to be in mine.

24:53.320 --> 24:55.835
For which I am forever grateful.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.639
Be careful, okay?

24:57.880 --> 25:00.952
I lost Agnes, I can't lose you too.

25:01.120 --> 25:03.032
You haven't lost her.

25:04.200 --> 25:06.590
When this is over,
you're gonna have both of us back.

25:11.400 --> 25:12.436
Heads up, people.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.310
7 a.m.
Our asset's in play.

25:15.480 --> 25:17.631
We have six vehicles
in floating box formation.

25:17.800 --> 25:19.678
Agents Ressler and Navabi
are to the southeast.

25:19.840 --> 25:22.275
<i>- Any visual?
- Still no movement, standing by.</i>

25:22.440 --> 25:23.760
Thank you for doing this.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.479
<i>I can't tell you
how much I appreciate it.</i>

25:25.640 --> 25:27.597
Come on, Liz,
we're not gonna do this now.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.399
She hates me.

25:29.560 --> 25:31.233
Yes, for now.

25:31.640 --> 25:32.756
She needs time.

25:33.440 --> 25:34.874
We all do.

25:35.040 --> 25:36.713
We all do?

25:37.680 --> 25:38.716
You hate me too?

25:38.960 --> 25:40.838
I don't hate you, Liz.

25:41.560 --> 25:43.916
<i>- But I do hate what you did.
- Target on the move.</i>

25:44.080 --> 25:46.037
<i>Charlie team is the trigger.
They have command.</i>

25:46.200 --> 25:48.192
They're making a left
towards Mason.

25:53.560 --> 25:55.631
What are we walking into?

25:57.400 --> 25:59.357
When I point at something, destroy it.

25:59.520 --> 26:00.874
That's all you need to know.

26:10.480 --> 26:13.632
There's your target. Four armed guards,
two in back, two in the front.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.877
You and Janowski
take the ones in the back.

26:17.360 --> 26:18.794
What are they doing?

26:18.960 --> 26:20.758
<i>Anybody see anything?</i>

26:20.920 --> 26:22.673
No, no vehicles approaching.

26:26.040 --> 26:27.394
They're getting out.

26:29.240 --> 26:30.390
They're on the train!

26:45.160 --> 26:48.278
- We need to know what's on that train.
- I am way ahead of you, sir.

26:49.320 --> 26:51.710
Except there is no train.
I mean, there's no train...

26:51.920 --> 26:53.115
...officially scheduled
on the track at this time.

26:53.280 --> 26:56.159
Well, it's there. Keen,
get on the phone and figure out why.

26:56.320 --> 26:59.199
Agent Ressler, you and the other
surveillance units, get there now.

26:59.360 --> 27:02.797
Call HRT, let them know they might
be boarding a hijacked train.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.354
I wouldn't.

27:27.040 --> 27:28.235
<i>CDC.</i>

27:28.400 --> 27:30.710
<i>- You guys crazy?
- Then who does have the authority?</i>

27:30.880 --> 27:32.280
- Keen.
- Get him on the phone.

27:32.440 --> 27:34.830
Liz. It's a CDC shipment.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.357
They must be transporting
some kind of biohazardous materials.

27:47.320 --> 27:49.118
What did we come here for?

27:52.760 --> 27:55.070
That was CDC's Washington director.

27:55.240 --> 27:57.880
- What are they moving?
- Six containers holding samples...

27:58.040 --> 28:00.430
...of every Class A
infectious substance.

28:00.720 --> 28:04.714
Ebola, dengue, polio,
HIV, and maybe 50 others.

28:04.880 --> 28:08.032
"Class A: substances capable
of causing permanent disability...

28:08.200 --> 28:10.510
...life-threatening, or fatal disease
in humans or animals."

28:10.680 --> 28:12.080
- My God.
- That's why McGrath...

28:12.240 --> 28:14.800
...had Halbeck shut down
the substations near Savannah.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.957
They triggered
the CDC's transfer protocol.

28:17.120 --> 28:20.238
They won't keep Class A substances
in a facility...

28:20.400 --> 28:23.199
...using only backup generators
for more than 72 hours.

28:23.360 --> 28:26.990
They're moving the samples to a secure
satellite lab outside Philadelphia.

28:39.400 --> 28:40.800
What's wrong?

28:41.640 --> 28:43.711
I was tracking the train
using Central Traffic Control's...

28:43.880 --> 28:45.712
...rail-monitoring system,
but the signal just went dark.

28:45.880 --> 28:46.916
How's that possible?

28:47.120 --> 28:49.430
I do not know.

28:49.600 --> 28:52.069
Let me see if I can access
the CTC's video grid.

28:52.240 --> 28:53.720
Tom, if you can hear us,
say something.

28:53.880 --> 28:56.793
Sorry, but the train should be visible
on this camera by now.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.229
It should be right there.

28:58.400 --> 29:00.676
That train,
you're telling me it just disappeared?

29:00.880 --> 29:03.270
Tom, Tom, if you can hear us,
say something.

29:05.200 --> 29:06.839
Tom.

29:13.520 --> 29:16.797
Singleton freight station,
mile marker 272.

29:16.960 --> 29:19.680
That's what you said, and we're here,
but nothing's come through.

29:19.840 --> 29:22.355
That's not possible.
There's only one rail line in the area.

29:22.520 --> 29:24.512
The train was going at least 40.
It should have passed you...

29:24.680 --> 29:26.353
<i>- ...two minutes ago.
- No, it didn't.</i>

29:26.680 --> 29:29.115
That was HRT on the line,
they're sending a Blackhawk...

29:29.280 --> 29:30.839
...with HRT operatives
out of Quantico.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.753
They can jump down
onto the roof of the train.

29:32.920 --> 29:35.071
That won't do us much good
if we don't know where it is.

29:35.240 --> 29:38.358
Aram, I want the exact coordinates
of its last known location.

29:38.520 --> 29:40.398
- Right here, sir.
- Send it to Agents Ressler and Navabi.

29:40.560 --> 29:43.997
That train didn't just vanish. Get out
there, figure out what's going on.

29:47.040 --> 29:48.838
Don't know if you can hear me,
the train's coming to a stop.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.151
- I'll try to get you coords if I can.
- Eckervelt.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.559
It's time to go.

30:02.120 --> 30:03.520
Where are we?

30:03.840 --> 30:07.356
Clear the area.
Ten minutes, then we roll.

30:08.440 --> 30:11.399
Mr. McGrath, this concludes
our broadcast day.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.119
What did I tell you, Halbeck?

30:13.280 --> 30:15.556
Leave the strategy
to the scrawny kids.

30:15.720 --> 30:16.995
<i>Tell Vincent
I'll meet him at the Lodge in 20.</i>

30:17.160 --> 30:19.720
Nice working with you, sir.

30:20.160 --> 30:21.913
Patronizing son of a bitch.

30:22.080 --> 30:23.719
<i>Aram, are you sure
about those coordinates?</i>

30:23.920 --> 30:25.752
I think so, why?

30:25.920 --> 30:28.276
Because I'm standing
where the train went missing...

30:28.440 --> 30:30.318
...and you said
there was only one track.

30:30.480 --> 30:33.040
<i>- Yeah, that's true.
- Why am I looking at another one?</i>

30:33.320 --> 30:35.232
<i>Some kind of a split-off line
going west.</i>

30:36.320 --> 30:38.198
West? No.

30:38.360 --> 30:41.159
By the looks of this material,
it's been put in recently.

30:41.360 --> 30:43.113
Wait, Halbeck and McGrath
built a second rail line?

30:43.320 --> 30:45.676
- Going where?
- We're about to find out.

30:59.080 --> 31:00.480
I think we found our train.

31:00.640 --> 31:03.075
<i>- Where?
- About 200 yards from the split-off.</i>

31:03.240 --> 31:05.038
The second set of tracks
leads to some kind of hangar.

31:05.200 --> 31:08.318
Okay, satellite mapping in the area,
done three weeks ago...

31:08.480 --> 31:10.472
...doesn't show a hangar
or a split-off.

31:10.680 --> 31:12.433
Maybe not,
but we're looking at both of them.

31:12.640 --> 31:15.030
They must be unloading
the CDC containers. We'll take a look.

31:15.200 --> 31:18.272
Negative. You two
aren't going anywhere. Sit tight.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.196
That's it, we're clear. Let's roll.

31:34.720 --> 31:37.519
- You sure you got the right one?
- Sample number 17.

31:37.720 --> 31:39.837
That was our deal. The rest is mine.

32:07.040 --> 32:09.157
You gotta be kidding me.

32:11.120 --> 32:12.236
Johan.

32:12.400 --> 32:14.278
Where the hell was that guy going?
The guy with the case.

32:14.720 --> 32:17.235
Please do not tell me
you parted with the best samples.

32:17.400 --> 32:19.710
Just one. Take it easy,
I told you I had a partner.

32:19.880 --> 32:21.200
I'm your partner now, Johan.

32:21.360 --> 32:24.558
And I've been out promising prospective
buyers the full complement...

32:24.720 --> 32:25.790
...of Class A weaponry.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.037
Do you have any idea
what was in that sample?

32:28.200 --> 32:30.317
Sorry, Raymond.
I don't know what to tell you.

32:30.480 --> 32:33.075
Well, I insist on speaking
with this so-called partner.

32:33.240 --> 32:35.391
At least let me try to buy it back.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.679
Be my guest.

32:38.840 --> 32:41.878
Miles McGrath.
His men went to meet him at the Lodge.

32:42.040 --> 32:43.633
It's a bar. Find him, talk to him.

32:43.800 --> 32:45.598
Hell, I hope you shoot the bastard.

32:50.040 --> 32:52.475
Sir, HRT is on site.
They're moving in now.

32:59.680 --> 33:00.716
Drop your weapons!

33:01.920 --> 33:04.310
- Down on the ground now!
- Drop your weapons!

33:10.400 --> 33:11.800
Drop it!

33:17.160 --> 33:18.310
We got a gun!

33:18.480 --> 33:20.597
- Reddington?
- He's gone.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.633
The feds are Halbeck's problem.

33:24.800 --> 33:27.395
All that matters to me
is that we are right on schedule.

33:38.880 --> 33:41.111
Gentlemen, mind if I join you?

33:41.280 --> 33:43.749
Yeah. We do.

33:45.440 --> 33:49.514
- Raymond Reddington.
- The Raymond Reddington?

33:49.680 --> 33:51.194
The Concierge of Crime?

33:51.360 --> 33:52.589
Man in the hat?

33:52.800 --> 33:54.439
Spy who stayed out in the cold?

33:54.600 --> 33:58.116
Haven't heard that last one.
Never read the Le CarrÃ© novel.

33:58.280 --> 34:00.840
Dembe, we should see
if we can get the audio book...

34:01.000 --> 34:02.593
...on cassette for the car.

34:03.080 --> 34:05.356
Now, about that sample.

34:05.800 --> 34:06.950
Screw you, I'm not...

34:11.159 --> 34:12.389
You were saying?

34:18.040 --> 34:20.235
- Wanna tell me what's going on?
- Take it easy.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.152
So your comms conveniently go dark...

34:22.320 --> 34:24.072
...the moment that train
goes off our radar?

34:24.239 --> 34:26.152
It's this place, look around.
They gotta be running...

34:26.320 --> 34:27.833
...some kind of broad-spectrum
signal jamming.

34:28.040 --> 34:30.475
- Where's Reddington?
- I had no idea he'd be here.

34:30.639 --> 34:33.280
Listen to me,
they opened one of the containers.

34:33.440 --> 34:34.476
What are you talking about?

34:34.639 --> 34:36.472
They took out one of the samples and
they gave it to one of McGrath's men.

34:36.639 --> 34:39.712
- You don't have everything.
- What sample?

34:40.280 --> 34:42.397
I don't know. But right now
it's on its way to McGrath.

34:42.600 --> 34:45.752
Some place called the Lodge.
Reddington and Dembe went after it.

34:45.920 --> 34:47.070
Get in.

34:48.719 --> 34:50.040
I don't know where he is.

34:50.199 --> 34:52.396
I'm supposed to call
to arrange delivery.

34:57.680 --> 34:59.353
Mr. Kirk.

34:59.760 --> 35:00.830
I have it.

35:01.560 --> 35:03.040
Yeah.

35:03.600 --> 35:04.954
Fine.

35:05.880 --> 35:07.678
I'll have it sent right away.

35:08.320 --> 35:10.232
Bench outside Dan's Tavern.

35:10.520 --> 35:12.989
A bar on Sedgwick. Half hour.

35:13.760 --> 35:17.231
Thank you
for your cooperation, Mr. McGrath.

35:17.400 --> 35:19.471
Just calculating my odds.

35:19.640 --> 35:21.791
I'd say my only chance
of leaving this room...

35:21.960 --> 35:26.352
- ...is by giving you what you want.
- You're a good strategist, Miles.

35:26.560 --> 35:29.678
But your odds
are longer than you think.

35:29.840 --> 35:32.514
The FBI found that missing train.

35:32.680 --> 35:36.151
Along with Halbeck and his team
and the CDC samples.

35:36.360 --> 35:39.671
In fact, I'd imagine
they'd be on their way here by now.

35:43.600 --> 35:46.798
Wait. Don't, Reddington!
Reddington, we can make a deal.

35:46.960 --> 35:49.634
Look, I know people,
what do you want?

35:49.800 --> 35:51.234
Don't walk away from me!

35:52.600 --> 35:53.795
Reddington!

36:04.200 --> 36:05.680
Not an ideal time, Harold.

36:05.840 --> 36:08.116
<i>You knew about that train hangar
and you didn't tell us.</i>

36:08.280 --> 36:11.159
<i>Yes. As I said,
I'm working on my own for the moment.</i>

36:11.320 --> 36:13.710
Ressler and Samar just called,
they found McGrath...

36:13.880 --> 36:15.997
<i>- ...handcuffed to a corpse.
- Wonderful.</i>

36:16.160 --> 36:18.595
<i>- I have to go.
- Wait, McGrath...</i>

36:18.760 --> 36:21.798
- ...did he tell you how to find Kirk?
- We just heard from the CDC.

36:21.960 --> 36:25.920
The missing sample, number 17, it's
cultures taken from the Ribowski virus.

36:26.120 --> 36:27.156
I know that name.

36:27.320 --> 36:29.391
One of the most deadly
viral pathogens we know of.

36:29.560 --> 36:33.918
<i>Killed tens of thousands
in Europe and Asia in the early 1900s.</i>

36:34.360 --> 36:36.829
Reddington. Reddington?

36:38.600 --> 36:40.796
Raymond, there's no one.

36:51.320 --> 36:53.118
Well done, Constantin.

36:53.280 --> 36:55.715
<i>I was about to say
the same to you, Raymond.</i>

36:55.880 --> 36:58.031
<i>So close, and yet so far.</i>

36:58.200 --> 36:59.873
<i>Still as tenacious as ever.</i>

37:00.040 --> 37:02.999
How'd you know I'd be here?
Even I didn't know a half hour ago.

37:03.160 --> 37:04.913
I knew because I'm the better man...

37:05.080 --> 37:07.549
<i>...always have been.
- I have what you want.</i>

37:07.720 --> 37:10.155
And I know why you want it.
So it's true then.

37:10.320 --> 37:13.233
After all these years, everything
you've feared has happened.

37:13.400 --> 37:15.915
<i>- It isn't over yet.
- It doesn't have to be.</i>

37:16.080 --> 37:18.993
You can have your virus.
All I want is Agnes in return.

37:19.160 --> 37:21.277
I don't think so, old boy.

37:21.440 --> 37:25.229
I will die before you
ever hold my granddaughter again.

37:51.640 --> 37:53.552
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

37:53.720 --> 37:56.280
<i>- What's going on?
- Nothing much, just hanging out.</i>

37:56.440 --> 37:58.033
<i>- Making a little dinner.
- Oh, yeah?</i>

37:58.200 --> 37:59.520
What are you making?

37:59.680 --> 38:02.673
<i>- Just some pasta, nothing big.
- Impressive. I never cook.</i>

38:02.880 --> 38:05.190
Plus, cooking for one is so hard,
you always have leftovers...

38:05.360 --> 38:07.920
...and then you get tired
of eating the same thing.

38:08.080 --> 38:09.560
Right,
so I'll just bring you some tomorrow.

38:10.120 --> 38:12.954
Look, I was going to ask you
for coffee...

38:13.120 --> 38:15.919
<i>...but since you're deep
in marinara sauce...</i>

38:16.080 --> 38:17.150
I need your help.

38:17.320 --> 38:20.597
About the transfer,
I don't know what to do.

38:20.760 --> 38:23.912
So, should I shower?
Or what time is dinner gonna be ready?

38:24.080 --> 38:27.391
- Oh, is someone there?
- Yes, but it's fine. We were...

38:27.560 --> 38:28.835
I didn't mean to interrupt.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.719
<i>- You're not interrupting.
- No, it's fine. I have to go.</i>

38:30.880 --> 38:32.599
I'll see you tomorrow.

38:44.400 --> 38:47.120
<i>Today, the doctor confirmed
our worst fears.</i>

38:47.280 --> 38:49.511
<i>Constantin is going
to need blood transfusions...</i>

38:49.720 --> 38:51.677
<i>...to raise his blood count.</i>

38:52.000 --> 38:54.071
<i>He's known his whole life
this day might come.</i>

38:54.240 --> 38:55.799
<i>But still, it's...</i>

38:55.960 --> 38:57.633
<i>It's terrifying.</i>

38:58.120 --> 39:01.113
<i>The only blessing
is that this accursed disease...</i>

39:01.280 --> 39:04.114
<i>...that has afflicted his family
for generations is passed...</i>

39:04.320 --> 39:05.595
<i>...from father to son.</i>

39:06.000 --> 39:08.515
<i>And that Masha is safe.</i>

39:35.280 --> 39:36.600
Masha.

39:38.600 --> 39:40.080
I got it.

39:55.080 --> 39:56.309
You lost him.

39:56.480 --> 39:57.516
Yeah.

39:57.680 --> 39:59.399
Our best shot at finding Agnes.

40:05.720 --> 40:08.633
I think I know why
Kirk wanted that virus.

40:08.840 --> 40:11.639
I saw him getting a blood transfusion
at Cape Breton.

40:11.840 --> 40:14.560
My mother wrote
about his family's history.

40:14.760 --> 40:17.320
Generations of Rostovs
had the same disease.

40:17.480 --> 40:20.359
A rare blood disorder
that's been killing them for centuries.

40:20.560 --> 40:22.677
Kirk is dying.

40:23.520 --> 40:26.957
And the Ribowski virus is a
temporary antidote to what afflicts him.

40:27.120 --> 40:28.952
Ribowski virus, that's what...

40:29.120 --> 40:31.794
Sample 17, isn't that a Class A toxin?

40:32.320 --> 40:35.996
- How's that gonna help him?
- He has aplastic anemia.

40:36.520 --> 40:40.070
A systemic failure to produce
viable bone marrow cells.

40:40.480 --> 40:44.599
It's been a death sentence
for generations of men in his family.

40:44.760 --> 40:46.274
Except a distant uncle...

40:46.440 --> 40:49.239
...who had contracted
the Ribowski virus.

40:49.400 --> 40:52.154
After getting the virus,
the uncle lived longer...

40:52.320 --> 40:55.074
...than any other Rostov
with the blood disease.

40:55.240 --> 40:58.312
So Kirk wanted the virus to recreate
what happened to his uncle?

40:58.480 --> 41:01.678
Yes. It's a simple
math problem, really.

41:01.840 --> 41:05.800
Kirk's disease prevents his body
from producing enough blood cells.

41:06.120 --> 41:09.875
The Ribowski virus
results in a rare form of leukemia.

41:10.040 --> 41:12.680
Which creates the opposite problem,
too many blood cells.

41:12.840 --> 41:15.480
So he's gonna give
himself leukemia?

41:15.640 --> 41:18.280
- Isn't that gonna kill him?
- Eventually.

41:18.440 --> 41:20.238
But by offsetting his blood disease...

41:20.400 --> 41:22.278
...he buys himself a few more years.

41:22.440 --> 41:26.036
- No one could be that desperate.
- But he is that desperate, Elizabeth.

41:26.200 --> 41:28.510
Because he no longer has you.

41:29.880 --> 41:33.157
You wanted to know
why he went so far to find you.

41:33.320 --> 41:35.710
Why there seemed to be nothing
he wouldn't do...

41:35.880 --> 41:38.873
...to physically get hold of you.
Now you know.

41:39.040 --> 41:43.000
He needs a biological descendant
to save his life.

41:43.160 --> 41:44.594
A genetic donation...

41:44.960 --> 41:48.556
...from the woman he believes
to be his long-lost daughter.

41:48.720 --> 41:52.600
That's what you are to him.
A collection of cells.

41:52.800 --> 41:55.713
This isn't about saving you from me.

41:55.880 --> 41:58.839
This is about saving you for him.

41:59.240 --> 42:01.835
- Well, he doesn't have me.
- No.

42:03.080 --> 42:04.912
But he has Agnes.
