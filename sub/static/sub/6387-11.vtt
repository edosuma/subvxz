WEBVTT

00:06.751 --> 00:09.702
What's up,
24-hour party people?

00:10.197 --> 00:11.831
Hey, Hank, you're just in time.

00:11.865 --> 00:13.557
Have a seat.
We're just about to say grace.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.181
For lunch? Really?

00:15.215 --> 00:16.715
I thought that was more
of a dinner thing.

00:16.749 --> 00:18.950
Don't get me wrong--I've had
some fabulous midday meals,

00:18.984 --> 00:20.851
but I never thought
to thank the chairman for 'em.

00:20.886 --> 00:22.954
But that's just me...

00:22.988 --> 00:24.655
an ungrateful heathen...

00:24.690 --> 00:28.658
highway to hell and whatnot.

00:30.461 --> 00:31.594
What's he doing?

00:31.628 --> 00:32.728
Shh.
Be quiet.

00:32.762 --> 00:35.263
If you must know, I am letting go

00:35.298 --> 00:36.931
and letting God.

00:36.965 --> 00:38.299
Letting God what?

00:38.333 --> 00:39.801
Letting him in...

00:39.835 --> 00:42.137
Letting him take care of me...

00:42.171 --> 00:43.872
Letting him help me stay sober.

00:43.906 --> 00:45.775
Does he let you out for
a drink every once in a while?

00:45.809 --> 00:47.511
Nailed it.

00:47.545 --> 00:49.279
Kid, don't leave me hanging.

00:49.313 --> 00:50.780
You're gonna have to go, Hank.

00:50.815 --> 00:52.950
- Why? What?
- I can't have you in my home

00:52.984 --> 00:55.085
if you're going to mock
and challenge my sobriety.

00:55.120 --> 00:56.554
I'm not challenging your sobriety,

00:56.588 --> 00:58.857
but mocking it is kind of fun.

01:02.128 --> 01:04.062
Okay, I'll be good.
I promise.

01:04.096 --> 01:06.565
Sorry, Hank. I've already
discussed this with Gabriel.

01:06.600 --> 01:07.567
Who the fuck is Gabriel?

01:07.601 --> 01:09.602
My sponsor and personal savior.

01:09.636 --> 01:11.437
Sure they didn't brainwash you
over there, Batesy?

01:11.471 --> 01:13.373
And what if they did?

01:13.407 --> 01:15.475
Maybe my brain needed washing, huh?

01:15.509 --> 01:16.776
- Jesus.
- Yes.

01:16.810 --> 01:19.612
Exactly, Hank.
You just hit it on the head.

01:19.647 --> 01:22.548
Jesus.

01:25.018 --> 01:27.586
I'm gonna go.

01:27.620 --> 01:28.587
Yeah.

01:28.621 --> 01:30.089
I appreciate that, Hank.

01:30.123 --> 01:31.757
No, no, I'm gonna hit the road.

01:31.791 --> 01:33.258
My work here is done.

01:33.293 --> 01:35.761
My life and my career
at an all-time low,

01:35.795 --> 01:36.895
New York is calling--

01:36.930 --> 01:38.630
What do you make of them big apples?

01:38.665 --> 01:41.966
Do you need a ride to the airport?

01:46.171 --> 01:56.510

02:38.188 --> 02:40.255
Can I get a Heineken, please?

02:40.290 --> 02:41.657
Sure.
Coming right up.

02:41.691 --> 02:45.894
- What the fuck do you want?
- I'm just saying hey.

02:45.929 --> 02:49.064
So did you end up signing
with Larry Levine?

02:49.099 --> 02:50.599
No.

02:50.634 --> 02:53.235
That didn't work out
quite as well as I'd hoped.

02:53.269 --> 02:55.504
Yeah, I actually heard all about it.

02:55.538 --> 02:56.872
I'm sorry.

02:56.906 --> 02:58.641
There's no keeping a secret
in this town.

02:58.675 --> 03:01.911
So you ready to come back to me yet?

03:01.945 --> 03:04.881
- Eat shit and die, Charlie.
- Okay.

03:07.084 --> 03:08.718
Oh, I also heard that Karen and Bates

03:08.752 --> 03:09.886
gave you the bum's rush.

03:09.921 --> 03:11.121
You're welcome to come back and crash

03:11.155 --> 03:12.155
at the villa if you want.

03:12.190 --> 03:13.490
I'd rather sleep in the Porsche.

03:13.524 --> 03:15.058
You can always park it
out in front of the villa.

03:15.093 --> 03:17.595
Don't worry your ugly,
bald head about it, okay?

03:17.629 --> 03:19.163
I'm going back to New York anyway.

03:19.197 --> 03:21.064
- I'm leaving tomorrow.
- I'm gonna miss you.

03:21.099 --> 03:23.000
- No, you won't.
- Yes, I will.

03:23.034 --> 03:24.501
No, if you were truly gonna miss me,

03:24.536 --> 03:26.770
then you wouldn't have done
something to drive me away.

03:26.804 --> 03:29.773
Well, maybe you should realize
my limitations

03:29.807 --> 03:33.177
and stop expecting me
to be someone I'm not.

03:33.211 --> 03:35.213
Nice, right?

03:35.247 --> 03:37.515
I really kind of zinged you
with that one, huh, buddy?

03:37.549 --> 03:40.451
Look, I'm sorry I let you down, okay?

03:40.485 --> 03:42.519
I'm really very sorry.

03:42.553 --> 03:45.221
I'm more sorry than I've
ever been about anything ever.

03:45.256 --> 03:47.523
And that's saying a lot.

03:47.558 --> 03:51.527
Oh...

03:51.561 --> 03:54.363
And Lizzie gave Stu a blowie
in exchange for a role

03:54.397 --> 03:56.431
in <i>Santa Monica Cop,</i> and I'm
really torn up about it.

03:57.834 --> 03:59.968
You're a real fucking
narcissist, you know that?

04:00.002 --> 04:02.371
Yes, but it still hurts.

04:02.405 --> 04:04.273
And who else do I have to share

04:04.307 --> 04:06.341
my pitiful tales of woe with?

04:06.376 --> 04:08.310
So you gonna come pick up
your stuff before you go?

04:08.344 --> 04:09.911
Maybe...

04:09.946 --> 04:11.346
I will.
Maybe I won't.

04:11.381 --> 04:12.581
Maybe I'll just sit

04:12.615 --> 04:14.316
on this barstool all night long
drinking, huh?

04:14.350 --> 04:16.151
You'll just have to wait
and see, won't you?

04:16.185 --> 04:17.685
Now fuck off.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.122
Be gone with you.

04:38.010 --> 04:41.111
Hey.
Lizzie, right?

04:41.145 --> 04:42.479
Oh, Hank.
Hello.

04:42.513 --> 04:44.314
Hey, I heard you gave Stu a blow job.

04:44.348 --> 04:48.518
Oh.

04:48.552 --> 04:50.720
I'm sorry.
It's just--it's very hard

04:50.754 --> 04:52.154
to keep a secret
in this town--

04:52.188 --> 04:54.323
- Impossible.
- Yeah, ain't that the truth.

04:54.357 --> 04:57.192
Yeah, you kind of tore his heart out.

04:57.226 --> 04:59.093
Yeah, well, so did you.

04:59.128 --> 05:01.262
Yeah, but he gave mine
the finger first, so...

05:01.297 --> 05:03.131
What do you care anyway?
I thought you hated him.

05:03.165 --> 05:04.532
I do...right now.

05:04.567 --> 05:06.000
But that doesn't mean
I want anybody else

05:06.035 --> 05:07.468
treating him like shit.

05:07.503 --> 05:09.537
I know.
I feel bad about it--I do.

05:09.572 --> 05:12.140
Whatever.
Shit happens.

05:12.175 --> 05:13.842
Blow jobs can be accidental.

05:13.876 --> 05:15.210
- I know, right?
- Yeah.

05:15.244 --> 05:16.945
You could be laughing
like you heard a joke,

05:16.980 --> 05:19.781
"Ha ha ha ha, oh, sorry.

05:19.816 --> 05:21.150
I'm so sorry."

05:21.152 --> 05:22.985
Well, it was an accident.

05:23.019 --> 05:24.787
What are you doing here anyway?

05:24.821 --> 05:26.122
I have the night off work.

05:26.156 --> 05:27.523
I felt like wetting my whistle.

05:27.557 --> 05:30.692
Well, can I--can I buy you
a whistle-wetter?

05:30.727 --> 05:33.128
You know what?
I have a better idea.

05:33.162 --> 05:36.731
What do you think about going
back to Charlie's place

05:36.765 --> 05:38.533
- and wetting our whistles there?
- What about Charlie?

05:38.567 --> 05:40.068
He's out for the night.

05:40.103 --> 05:42.304
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

05:42.339 --> 05:43.639
Well, I do have to pick up my stuff.

05:43.673 --> 05:44.907
See?
It's a good idea, right?

05:44.942 --> 05:46.376
I'm not gonna sleep with you.

05:46.410 --> 05:48.478
Oh.
You're not?

05:48.513 --> 05:50.113
No. I couldn't do that
to the poor bastard--

05:50.148 --> 05:51.982
at least I don't think I could.

05:52.016 --> 05:54.418
I mean, you'd pretty much
have to tie me up

05:54.452 --> 05:56.654
like Kathy Bates in <i>Misery,</i>
only instead of hobbling me,

05:56.688 --> 05:58.856
you'd have to, you know...

05:58.891 --> 06:00.591
rape me.

06:00.626 --> 06:01.926
That sounds like fun.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.994
Oh, dear.

06:04.029 --> 06:05.930
♪ Undercover ♪

06:05.964 --> 06:07.698
♪ undercover ♪

06:07.732 --> 06:10.600
♪ undercover of the night ♪

06:10.635 --> 06:12.935
All right, Lizzie,
I am reasonably certain

06:12.970 --> 06:14.537
that I'm not gonna have sex with you.

06:14.571 --> 06:16.905
Oh, I know you're not.

06:16.940 --> 06:18.207
I'm glad to hear that.

06:18.241 --> 06:20.676
And how do you know this exactly?

06:20.711 --> 06:23.546
Surprise!

06:23.580 --> 06:26.616
Holy shitness.

06:26.650 --> 06:29.086
Everyone I love and loathe
all in one room.

06:29.120 --> 06:31.622
We decided to throw you
a going-away party, Hank.

06:31.656 --> 06:32.623
It was Charlie's idea.

06:32.658 --> 06:34.626
- Mine.
- You shouldn't have.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.094
Sent Lizzie to try
to lure you back here.

06:36.128 --> 06:38.464
- Did she do a good job?
- She did very well.

06:38.498 --> 06:40.900
I thought she wanted to,
you know, fuck me.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.868
Yeah, she's a very good actress.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.872
- You were acting, right?
- Of course.

06:47.341 --> 06:49.742
- I'm still mad at you.
- Of course you are.

06:49.777 --> 06:52.813
In the meantime, enjoy your party.

07:09.464 --> 07:14.134
- ...Once...***
- What's wrong with you?

07:14.169 --> 07:16.470
So are you really going this time?

07:16.504 --> 07:17.638
Yep.

07:17.672 --> 07:19.673
Are you gonna miss the shit out
of me or what?

07:19.708 --> 07:21.175
It's always the same thing, you know,

07:21.209 --> 07:22.509
whether you're coming or going.

07:22.544 --> 07:24.177
My heart skips a beat or two,

07:24.212 --> 07:27.780
and then I just have to clear up
the mess you leave behind.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.248
Oh, you found a new way of calling me

07:29.283 --> 07:31.350
a charming asshole--
Good for you, Karen.

07:31.384 --> 07:32.584
- Yeah.
- But I've got to be off

07:32.619 --> 07:33.752
like a prom dress.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.353
You've got a lot of shit to deal with.

07:35.388 --> 07:37.355
Oh, I have some shit.

07:37.390 --> 07:38.590
Who's the creeper?

07:38.624 --> 07:41.293
Hank, I want you to meet Gabriel.

07:41.327 --> 07:42.361
Oh, nice to meet you, Gabe.

07:42.395 --> 07:44.797
- It's Gabriel.
- Yeah?

07:44.831 --> 07:46.065
So, what gives, dude?

07:46.099 --> 07:47.833
I mean, I appreciate you coming
to the send-off and all,

07:47.868 --> 07:49.368
but the last thing
you need is a fucking party.

07:49.403 --> 07:51.704
That is exactly what I said.

07:51.739 --> 07:52.972
- Right?
- Karenina.

07:53.007 --> 07:54.107
Do you have a tampon?

07:54.141 --> 07:55.675
I just started bleeding
in my "prannies."

07:56.978 --> 07:58.378
Ambrosia.

07:58.413 --> 08:00.380
I love a woman on her period.

08:00.415 --> 08:02.416
- Oh, my God.
- You do?

08:03.751 --> 08:05.819
I think it's very important

08:05.853 --> 08:08.888
to challenge Richard's sobriety.

08:08.923 --> 08:10.690
Great minds, Gabe.

08:10.725 --> 08:12.625
That's what I was doing,
and he kicked me out for it.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.327
There's positive ways
of doing it, Hank.

08:14.361 --> 08:15.795
You were negging him.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.563
How does Gabe know I was negging him?

08:17.597 --> 08:19.531
It's Gabriel.
And he tells me everything.

08:19.566 --> 08:20.766
- I tell him everything.
- Everything?

08:20.800 --> 08:22.368
- Everything.
- Huh. Does he know

08:22.402 --> 08:24.570
about the glorious man-gina?

08:24.605 --> 08:25.971
Everything, Hank.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.406
I'm not ashamed.

08:27.441 --> 08:29.041
- Moody.
- Oh, hey, Sam.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.543
- What's up, man?
- How you doing?

08:30.577 --> 08:32.010
What are you leaving for,
motherfucker?

08:32.044 --> 08:33.746
You did fire me, buddy.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.248
How do you feel?

08:35.282 --> 08:36.883
- You want a drink right now?
- I do...So much.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.852
- Here, motherfucker.
- No, no, no, no.

08:38.885 --> 08:40.419
Don't fucking raise
your hand on me, man.

08:40.453 --> 08:41.654
Who the fuck is this clown?

08:41.688 --> 08:43.490
That's his personal savior.

08:43.525 --> 08:46.694
Do you need a drink right now?

08:47.996 --> 08:49.630
No.

08:49.665 --> 08:51.199
No, I don't need a drink.

08:51.233 --> 08:55.070
- You see the difference, right?
- I do.

08:55.104 --> 08:57.772
Oh, you're my angel, Gabriel.

08:57.807 --> 08:59.774
It's a pleasure.

08:59.808 --> 09:01.275
Fuck is that all about, man?

09:01.310 --> 09:03.845
Fuck if I know.

09:03.879 --> 09:06.046
- Man, we good, right?
- I don't know, Sam.

09:06.081 --> 09:08.015
You fired me,
you dangled me off a balcony,

09:08.049 --> 09:09.283
and then you replaced me

09:09.317 --> 09:10.784
with my daughter's stupid
fucking boyfriend.

09:10.818 --> 09:12.752
I did all that shit
out of love, motherfucker.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.420
That's how it's done where I'm from.

09:14.454 --> 09:15.755
You know that, man.

09:15.789 --> 09:18.157
I'm gonna miss you anyway,
though, buddy, for real.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.025
- We was good together.
- All right.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.528
Well, how's it working out
with Tyler anyway?

09:22.562 --> 09:23.829
Oh, that motherfucker's
excellent, man.

09:23.864 --> 09:26.733
I mean, this motherfucking kid
got my rhythm down pat.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.568
I mean, you kind of had
my shit, too, yo.

09:28.603 --> 09:30.904
But I had to improvise
around that pretentious shit

09:30.939 --> 09:32.640
you was writing, but the kid--
he spikes it every time, man,

09:32.674 --> 09:34.208
- with some bong-bong.
- Great.

09:34.243 --> 09:35.276
Thanks for the download.

09:35.310 --> 09:37.445
Hey.

09:40.582 --> 09:43.149
Hey.
You brought Kali, huh?

09:43.184 --> 09:46.052
Yeah. I think I got
another shot at her and shit.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.353
- Oh.
- She really warming up

09:47.388 --> 09:48.621
to a kid, man.

09:48.655 --> 09:50.323
And I've been
on some real gentlemen shit--

09:50.357 --> 09:53.125
you know, fucking opening doors,
"Thank you."

09:53.160 --> 09:55.394
When she sneeze,
I fucking bless the bitch.

09:55.429 --> 09:56.829
All right.
Good for you, man.

09:56.863 --> 09:58.431
I-I hope it works out.
She's a good gal.

09:58.465 --> 10:00.166
Motherfuckin' right she is, man.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.969
And her career's
about to blow up to the moon.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.838
So not only this bitch
gonna make me more money

10:04.872 --> 10:07.774
than I already have,
I love the shit out of her.

10:07.809 --> 10:09.276
Thinking about putting
a baby up in her ass.

10:09.311 --> 10:10.745
"In her ass"?

10:10.779 --> 10:12.480
- I mean getting her pregnant.
- Oh, yeah.

10:12.514 --> 10:13.981
Yeah. No, I know
what you're talking about.

10:14.016 --> 10:16.118
But I'm just thinking maybe
you should think about that.

10:16.152 --> 10:17.486
Why the fuck not, man?

10:17.520 --> 10:20.121
The sun got nine planets.
I can have nine baby mamas.

10:20.155 --> 10:22.957
- Wow.
- Enjoying your par-tay?

10:22.991 --> 10:25.426
Yeah, but I'm still mad at you.

10:25.460 --> 10:27.461
Duly noted.

10:27.495 --> 10:29.062
Damna-lama, Runkle.

10:29.096 --> 10:30.430
Who the fuck
is that bitch right there?

10:30.464 --> 10:32.031
What the fuck?

10:32.065 --> 10:34.667
Oh, you have a little
flotsam and jetsam there.

10:34.701 --> 10:36.068
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, there we go.

10:36.102 --> 10:37.502
Excuse me, gentlemen.

10:37.536 --> 10:39.570
I have to redo my makeup now.

10:41.907 --> 10:43.341
Jesus!

10:43.376 --> 10:45.176
Could you two be any more obvious?

10:45.210 --> 10:47.879
What the fuck
crawled up your ass, Runkle?

10:47.913 --> 10:49.113
We're just talking here.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.282
Lizzie has to work
first thing in the morning,

10:51.316 --> 10:53.183
and we are discussing her character.

10:53.218 --> 10:54.284
Oh, I see.

10:54.319 --> 10:55.419
So how does your character

10:55.453 --> 10:57.021
feel about having his dick
in your mouth?

10:57.055 --> 10:59.222
- Don't be crude, Charlie.
- That's disgusting.

10:59.257 --> 11:00.691
What do you mean it's disgusting?

11:00.725 --> 11:02.793
It actually happened.
In real life.

11:02.827 --> 11:05.329
- It was business.
- Strictly business.

11:05.363 --> 11:06.797
Yep.
Pure biz...

11:06.831 --> 11:11.201
Pure heavenly biz.

11:11.235 --> 11:12.735
You just blew him again, didn't you?

11:12.770 --> 11:15.504
I thought it was <i>a</i> blow job--

11:15.539 --> 11:17.373
one blow job.

11:17.407 --> 11:19.408
What's the difference
between one blow job and two?

11:19.442 --> 11:21.044
Blow jobs are like handshakes.

11:21.078 --> 11:22.712
My world is crumbling.

11:22.746 --> 11:25.082
You know, you're really
going to have to find a way

11:25.116 --> 11:26.483
to put this behind you, Runkle.

11:26.518 --> 11:28.519
In the meantime, could you
get me another drink?

11:28.554 --> 11:30.688
Oh, and while you're at it, Charlie...

11:30.723 --> 11:32.357
just...

11:32.391 --> 11:33.758
balance...

11:33.792 --> 11:35.893
Thank you.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.599
Ugh.

11:42.569 --> 11:45.037
- Something's wrong.
- What are you going on about?

11:45.072 --> 11:48.340
Stu and I, we haven't fucked
in, like, days.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.608
What's so weird about that?

11:49.643 --> 11:51.844
Sometimes you need a break
from hitting that shit.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.679
No, trust me, it's weird.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.582
Usually the guy can't keep
his hands off me, okay?

11:56.616 --> 11:57.950
- Mm-hmm.
- Fuck, the last time

11:57.984 --> 11:59.251
something like this happened,

11:59.285 --> 12:00.953
Charlie was playing secretary
with his secretary.

12:00.987 --> 12:02.387
- Remember that shit?
- Who can forget?

12:02.421 --> 12:05.357
That was, like,
the beginning of the end.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.326
But I'm sure
it'll work itself out, you know.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.561
Everybody goes through
their peaks and valleys.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.263
Yeah, you and Karen?

12:11.297 --> 12:12.531
Never.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.032
That shit was fierce.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.367
What can I say?

12:15.401 --> 12:17.202
See, that's what I'm talking about.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.971
- I want that.
- Okay, look, here's an idea.

12:19.005 --> 12:20.372
Why don't you just go grab

12:20.407 --> 12:22.474
that well-hung <i>macher</i> of yours
and jump his bones,

12:22.508 --> 12:24.109
- remind him what he's missing?
- Mm.

12:24.143 --> 12:26.211
We're just guys.
We're stupid sometimes--

12:26.246 --> 12:27.680
a lot of times.

12:27.714 --> 12:29.414
I know.

12:29.448 --> 12:31.283
Don't go, Hanky.

12:31.317 --> 12:33.652
Life's so much more interesting
when you're around.

12:33.686 --> 12:35.020
I don't think Karen and Becca

12:35.055 --> 12:36.956
would agree with you on that one.

12:36.990 --> 12:39.058
They fucking love you
to pieces, you dumb shit.

12:39.093 --> 12:40.126
We all do.

12:40.161 --> 12:42.028
You just have trouble loving yourself.

12:42.062 --> 12:43.296
Hmm?

12:43.330 --> 12:45.465
Oh, thank you,
Dr. Sigmund Smurf.

12:45.499 --> 12:46.832
Well, you're welcome.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.734
That'll be five cents, please.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.269
Wouldn't it be great
if we could just go back

12:50.303 --> 12:53.639
to being stupid and happy
like those two?

12:53.674 --> 12:56.976
It's so sweet.

12:57.011 --> 12:58.311
- Oh.
- Can I join?

12:58.345 --> 12:59.679
Ooh, a big giraffe.

12:59.714 --> 13:01.982
Okay, now, this--
this would be a threesome

13:02.016 --> 13:03.850
- for all times.
- Oh, yeah.

13:03.885 --> 13:05.018
Oh, yeah.

13:05.053 --> 13:06.486
This shit would be off the chain.

13:06.521 --> 13:09.523
Our chemistry
would be like--pow.

13:09.557 --> 13:11.259
Okay?
I would be the fucking spice,

13:11.293 --> 13:13.695
the sexual tabasco.

13:13.729 --> 13:16.164
You guys could have
your sensual, your lovemaking,

13:16.198 --> 13:17.799
and I'd work the balls
and the assholes

13:17.833 --> 13:20.001
- and all that shit. No.
- Yeah.

13:20.035 --> 13:21.235
You know you want it.

13:21.270 --> 13:23.103
God damn it.

13:23.138 --> 13:25.873
Do you hear
how sexually frustrated I am?

13:25.907 --> 13:27.274
Yes. Yes.

13:27.308 --> 13:28.274
Fuck. I'm hot.
Get off.

13:28.309 --> 13:29.576
I need to find Stu.

13:29.610 --> 13:32.044
I love that little chick.

13:32.079 --> 13:34.380
- Oh, me too.
- Stop it.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.788
I was looking all over for you.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.557
Here I am.

13:43.591 --> 13:44.791
Not talking to Stu.

13:44.826 --> 13:45.993
Just doing my job.

13:46.027 --> 13:47.494
Look, I'm sorry

13:47.529 --> 13:50.064
that I've been such a freak
about everything.

13:50.098 --> 13:52.000
You're entitled
to your feelings, Charlie,

13:52.034 --> 13:53.701
but we're not exactly married,
you know?

13:53.736 --> 13:55.737
I know.
You're absolutely right.

13:55.771 --> 13:56.872
You are right.

13:56.906 --> 13:59.474
And I think I would like
to change that.

14:00.910 --> 14:02.010
What are you talking about?

14:02.044 --> 14:03.211
I just--
I'd like to put

14:03.246 --> 14:05.714
all this nasty blow jobs stuff

14:05.748 --> 14:08.083
behind us and get serious.

14:08.117 --> 14:10.986
I want to have a real
relationship with you, Lizzie.

14:11.020 --> 14:12.654
You and me.

14:12.689 --> 14:13.989
Sitting in a tree.

14:14.024 --> 14:16.425
- K-i-s-s-i-n-g.
- You're so sweet, Charlie.

14:16.459 --> 14:18.961
It's just I've been thinking
about this a lot lately.

14:18.995 --> 14:21.096
And I think I realized something.

14:21.131 --> 14:24.333
I think you might be my last hope

14:24.368 --> 14:25.668
for true love.

14:25.702 --> 14:28.871
But how can that be, Charlie?

14:28.906 --> 14:31.007
You've been so furious with me
for blowing you.

14:31.041 --> 14:33.910
Yes, and that still doesn't sit well.

14:33.944 --> 14:35.778
But, like I said,
I've been thinking about it,

14:35.813 --> 14:39.081
and I don't think
that it's a deal-breaker.

14:39.116 --> 14:40.950
So here are my terms:

14:40.984 --> 14:45.120
If you would be willing
to not blow anyone but me,

14:45.154 --> 14:48.257
then I would be willing to give
the two of us a real shot.

14:48.291 --> 14:49.391
What do you say?

14:52.228 --> 14:54.429
No.

14:54.463 --> 14:56.865
No?

14:56.899 --> 14:58.867
Just like that, no?

14:58.902 --> 15:01.804
Look, we're at very different
places in our lives, Charlie.

15:01.838 --> 15:03.739
I'm at the beginning
of what I hope will be

15:03.773 --> 15:04.840
an interesting journey,

15:04.875 --> 15:06.375
and you're...

15:06.410 --> 15:07.610
At the end?

15:07.644 --> 15:09.613
I didn't say that.

15:09.647 --> 15:10.780
But you were thinking it.

15:10.815 --> 15:13.484
No, I wasn't.

15:19.124 --> 15:21.325
Okay, I'm gonna go, Charlie.

15:21.359 --> 15:22.860
I have to get some rest
before tomorrow,

15:22.894 --> 15:25.395
and my jaw is just killing me.

15:25.430 --> 15:30.333
Look, why don't we put a pin
in this for the moment?

15:30.367 --> 15:32.335
Okay?

15:39.976 --> 15:42.345
Um, what are we doing?

15:42.379 --> 15:44.380
Oh, I don't know, baby.

15:44.414 --> 15:47.817
I just thought you might want
to fuck me silly

15:47.851 --> 15:50.153
on Charlie's bed.

15:51.723 --> 15:53.924
I don't know, Marcy.
That seems kind of wrong.

15:53.959 --> 15:56.527
- What?
- What?

15:56.561 --> 16:00.598
We play all kinds
of crazy fucking sex games

16:00.632 --> 16:02.634
involving humiliating
my ex-husband,

16:02.668 --> 16:04.735
and this is sick and wrong,
all of a sudden?

16:04.770 --> 16:06.171
What the fuck is up with you, Stu?

16:06.205 --> 16:08.106
Nothing.

16:08.141 --> 16:09.541
You're on your period.

16:09.576 --> 16:11.477
So fucking what?

16:11.511 --> 16:12.745
We'll throw down a towel.

16:12.779 --> 16:14.347
You said you loved my bloody cooch.

16:14.382 --> 16:16.216
How bloody we talking?

16:16.251 --> 16:18.485
Just started.
A little rusty.

16:18.520 --> 16:21.855
Uh...
I do love your bloody cooch.

16:21.890 --> 16:23.991
Okay, yeah.
Yeah, okay.

16:24.025 --> 16:25.726
You want to fuck?
Let's fuck.

16:25.760 --> 16:28.228
Yeah.
There's my stallion.

16:28.263 --> 16:31.965
Here comes <i>El Presidente.</i>

16:32.000 --> 16:33.567
Open wide for...

16:33.601 --> 16:35.535
- Come on, daddy.
- Yeah. There we are.

16:35.570 --> 16:37.237
Yeah.

16:43.277 --> 16:45.779
- What the fuck, Stu?
- What?

16:45.813 --> 16:47.881
You're not even remotely hard.

16:47.915 --> 16:50.650
- Getting there.
- Not really.

16:50.684 --> 16:51.851
Don't stare.

16:51.886 --> 16:54.320
You're always hard.

16:54.354 --> 16:55.487
Well, I had a few cocktails.

16:55.522 --> 16:56.889
So fucking what?

16:56.923 --> 16:58.824
I could tie you off
and shoot you up with heroin

16:58.858 --> 17:01.060
and you'd still have a muscly
baby's arm between your legs.

17:01.095 --> 17:03.696
I don't see why you have
to emasculate me, Marcy.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.999
Something's up with you, Stu.

17:06.032 --> 17:07.968
There is nothing up with me, Marcy.

17:08.002 --> 17:10.002
Nothing.

17:12.307 --> 17:14.575
Obviously.

17:19.648 --> 17:21.617
God damn it.

17:21.651 --> 17:25.589
You!

17:27.592 --> 17:28.926
Hey, sweetie.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.495
How you doing?

17:30.529 --> 17:31.896
- Good.
- Yeah?

17:31.930 --> 17:33.164
Things are good.

17:33.199 --> 17:35.901
I feel like we're
in a good place right now.

17:35.935 --> 17:37.736
I trust him.
I really do.

17:37.770 --> 17:40.472
I was asking more
about your general well-being.

17:40.506 --> 17:42.207
Not your relationship.

17:42.241 --> 17:43.675
Oh.

17:43.710 --> 17:46.044
I'm peachy.

17:46.079 --> 17:48.213
Are you gonna miss me?

17:48.247 --> 17:49.748
Yes and no.

17:49.782 --> 17:51.115
Oh, that's right.
You like me better

17:51.150 --> 17:52.217
when I'm in New York, right?

17:52.251 --> 17:53.351
Come on, dad.

17:53.385 --> 17:54.986
You do have a tendency
to blow into town

17:55.020 --> 17:56.854
and cause a fair amount of chaos.

17:56.889 --> 17:58.689
This is true.

17:58.723 --> 18:01.625
Well, prepare for life
to get a lot more boring

18:01.660 --> 18:02.960
without me around.

18:02.994 --> 18:05.062
I think we can handle it.
Right, mom?

18:05.097 --> 18:09.666
Boring right now sounds like
the south of France to me.

18:09.700 --> 18:11.034
Well, you two may need
a break from me,

18:11.068 --> 18:14.304
but I'm gonna miss you guys
something awful.

18:14.338 --> 18:16.973
The older I get,
the clearer it becomes

18:17.007 --> 18:18.341
that you two were the best thing
that ever happened

18:18.376 --> 18:20.243
to an old fool like me.

18:20.278 --> 18:22.946
And I just love you both so much.

18:22.980 --> 18:25.782
I want you to be happy.

18:25.817 --> 18:27.818
Oh, my God.

18:27.852 --> 18:28.819
Did you get that?

18:28.853 --> 18:30.354
Yeah, I think I did.

18:30.389 --> 18:32.423
What?
What'd I do?

18:32.457 --> 18:35.026
Well, you were just totally sincere.

18:35.060 --> 18:36.695
I mean, not even remotely glib.

18:36.729 --> 18:38.330
- Huh.
- And you didn't even swear.

18:38.364 --> 18:40.999
Right?

18:41.034 --> 18:43.602
Fancy that. I should try
that shit more--

18:43.636 --> 18:45.036
Oh, shit.

18:45.071 --> 18:47.638
It's okay.

18:47.673 --> 18:49.540
You should go change
your T-shirt.

18:49.575 --> 18:51.609
You still get me wet.

18:51.643 --> 18:54.345
You didn't hear that.

19:03.922 --> 19:05.390
What the fuck?

19:05.424 --> 19:06.825
I'm sorry, Hank.

19:06.859 --> 19:07.826
You weren't supposed to see that.

19:07.860 --> 19:10.061
Fucking-A right I wasn't.

19:11.864 --> 19:13.965
Look, I was overcome with emotion.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.035
I mean, he's done so much for me.

19:17.070 --> 19:18.504
He kissed me.
On the mouth.

19:18.538 --> 19:19.538
Yeah, he does that sometimes.

19:19.573 --> 19:20.639
I felt something.

19:20.674 --> 19:21.974
Obviously.

19:22.009 --> 19:23.543
We went with it.

19:23.577 --> 19:25.979
Yeah, you went with it all the
way to fucking Blow Job City.

19:26.013 --> 19:27.381
Okay, what can I say?

19:27.415 --> 19:29.483
It felt like the thing to do.
For the nonce.

19:29.517 --> 19:31.018
What can you say?

19:31.052 --> 19:33.721
Your fucking wife
is sitting right out there.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.523
I know.
It's just...

19:35.557 --> 19:37.392
Karen and I, we're just

19:37.426 --> 19:39.494
in different emotional
zip codes right now.

19:39.528 --> 19:40.929
Yeah, I'll say.

19:40.963 --> 19:42.564
You're in fucking emotional
West Hollywood right now.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.266
It's not about gay or straight.

19:44.300 --> 19:45.734
No, it never is with you.

19:45.768 --> 19:47.702
Look, Karen does not understand

19:47.737 --> 19:49.571
what I'm going through right now.

19:49.606 --> 19:52.907
I'm all raw and churned up inside.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.044
It's gonna be okay.

19:56.078 --> 19:57.411
I'm gonna find my way back to her,

19:57.446 --> 19:58.713
I promise.

19:58.747 --> 19:59.847
Yeah, that's what I always said.

19:59.881 --> 20:01.449
Didn't quite make it, though, did I?

20:01.483 --> 20:03.117
And it's not right to toy with her.

20:03.152 --> 20:05.886
Oh, toy.
Yeah, you're one to talk.

20:05.921 --> 20:07.855
Yeah, but for once,
I'm not the one in the wrong.

20:07.889 --> 20:10.091
There is no right or wrong, Hank,

20:10.125 --> 20:12.059
not when you trust your instincts.

20:12.093 --> 20:14.895
Bates, you were getting
sucked off by your sponsor.

20:19.166 --> 20:21.300
I should go home.

20:23.604 --> 20:26.373
This--this was not a good idea.
It's just--

20:26.407 --> 20:29.176
It's just--it's too much
too soon.

20:29.210 --> 20:31.011
I'll take you, 'cause we
have things to discuss.

20:31.045 --> 20:33.046
Yes.
Yes, we do, Gabriel.

20:33.081 --> 20:35.382
A great many things, my dear boy.

20:39.119 --> 20:41.321
Keep an eye on Karen for me?

20:41.355 --> 20:42.956
Sure.

20:42.990 --> 20:44.624
And don't get any weird ideas.

20:44.658 --> 20:46.092
What the fuck, dude?

20:46.127 --> 20:47.694
You were just tonsils-deep
in that guy,

20:47.728 --> 20:49.629
and you're asking me
to behave myself with your wife?

20:49.664 --> 20:51.665
Yes.

20:51.699 --> 20:53.600
Why is that weird?

20:53.634 --> 20:55.936
Get the fuck out of here.

21:05.546 --> 21:07.313
- You all right?
- Yeah.

21:07.348 --> 21:09.115
I just, you know,

21:09.149 --> 21:10.517
I wanted to get some fresh air.

21:10.551 --> 21:13.052
God, it's kind of a freak show
up there.

21:13.086 --> 21:14.921
Oh, you don't know
the half of it, lady.

21:14.955 --> 21:16.656
Really?

21:18.191 --> 21:20.493
So Bates and the creeper went home.

21:20.527 --> 21:22.328
- Thank God.
- Really?

21:22.362 --> 21:23.929
Tell me what you really feel.

21:25.164 --> 21:27.098
No, it's just nice to have a break

21:27.132 --> 21:28.099
from the project.

21:28.133 --> 21:29.333
Project?

21:29.367 --> 21:31.669
Yes, his rehabilitation, you know.

21:31.703 --> 21:33.170
It's this huge project.

21:33.204 --> 21:35.539
There's, like, no space
for anything else right now.

21:35.573 --> 21:36.940
Come on.

21:36.974 --> 21:38.341
Don't be so hard on yourself.

21:38.375 --> 21:40.443
Why shouldn't I be hard on myself?

21:40.477 --> 21:44.314
I pick the most absurdly wrong men,

21:44.348 --> 21:47.050
and then I just ping-pong
between them.

21:47.085 --> 21:50.254
Wouldn't say you're
a serial ping-pongamist.

21:50.289 --> 21:51.389
Big deal.

21:51.423 --> 21:53.558
I'm just tired

21:53.592 --> 21:56.528
of always keeping it together
for someone else, you know.

21:56.563 --> 21:59.331
It just--I want to be
the crazy one some--

21:59.366 --> 22:01.300
I want to, like, strip off my clothes

22:01.335 --> 22:02.401
and just run down the street naked.

22:02.436 --> 22:04.403
I would very much like to see that.

22:04.437 --> 22:05.571
I would camp out

22:05.605 --> 22:07.407
to buy tickets.

22:07.441 --> 22:10.076
What?

22:17.787 --> 22:19.855
Bates asked me to behave myself.

22:19.889 --> 22:21.557
Oh, fuck that.

22:21.591 --> 22:24.326
I like you when you're crazy.

22:24.361 --> 22:25.428
You're leaving tomorrow, right?

22:25.462 --> 22:26.863
- I am.
- So what's the difference?

22:26.897 --> 22:28.430
I've heard that before.
It doesn't end well.

22:28.465 --> 22:30.700
It does end well.
It always ends well.

22:30.734 --> 22:32.369
Mm.

22:36.974 --> 22:39.509
I can't believe these words
are about to come out

22:39.544 --> 22:41.378
of my mouth,
but let's not do this, Karen.

22:41.412 --> 22:44.448
You've got so much shit going on
in your life right now.

22:44.482 --> 22:45.616
You don't want to add this to the mix.

22:45.650 --> 22:47.718
- Really? I do.
- Yeah.

22:47.752 --> 22:50.354
Besides, if you sampled
my wares again,

22:50.388 --> 22:52.256
you couldn't just do it once.

22:52.290 --> 22:53.824
- You know that.
- So what?

22:53.858 --> 22:57.294
And then you'd be in a world
of conflicted emotional shit.

22:57.328 --> 22:58.929
And shit.

22:58.963 --> 23:03.167
- You know?
- You're right.

23:03.201 --> 23:05.869
Thank you for letting me
be the crazy one for once.

23:05.904 --> 23:07.338
It's my pleasure.

23:07.372 --> 23:12.443
It was nice for me to be
the sane one for once.

23:12.477 --> 23:16.714
It gave me a morally righteous boner.

23:16.749 --> 23:18.216
Is that what that was?

23:18.250 --> 23:19.217
Mm-hmm.

23:19.251 --> 23:21.052
Maybe that was just you.

23:21.087 --> 23:22.821
I hope so.

23:27.827 --> 23:30.262
Oh, kill me now.

23:33.066 --> 23:35.935
Come on.

23:41.208 --> 23:42.675
There you--

23:42.709 --> 23:46.012
Stop.

23:46.046 --> 23:48.681
Mwah.
Mwah.

24:03.465 --> 24:05.833
Hey, have you guys
seen Tyler anywhere?

24:05.868 --> 24:09.003
No.

24:09.037 --> 24:10.972
Are you okay?

24:11.006 --> 24:12.607
Then after that shit, I hit that bitch

24:12.642 --> 24:14.209
with a motherfucking minivan.

24:14.244 --> 24:15.711
W-what's a minivan?

24:15.745 --> 24:18.247
Two in the front,
five in the rear.

24:18.281 --> 24:20.216
Shit, yo.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.685
All right, break it up, funny people.

24:22.719 --> 24:25.021
- Anybody seen Kali?
- Too many.

24:25.055 --> 24:26.722
Maybe she in the bathroom, man.

24:26.756 --> 24:28.057
- Uh-huh.
- Hit this shit.

24:35.132 --> 24:38.034
Uh, hold on.
I'll be out in a second.

24:44.909 --> 24:46.309
What's with you
barging in the bathroom?

24:46.344 --> 24:47.978
- Is that your only move?
- Shit.

24:48.012 --> 24:50.681
You got to be fucking kidding me.

24:52.184 --> 24:55.219
- Oh.
- What, she walked in on me.

24:55.253 --> 24:56.354
- I had to hide.
- You think

24:56.388 --> 24:57.588
this is fucking funny?

24:57.622 --> 24:59.323
No, but I think it was inevitable.

24:59.357 --> 25:01.125
My daughter is out there right now.

25:01.159 --> 25:02.760
You think it's okay to disrespect her?

25:02.794 --> 25:04.862
Oh, come on, man,
I'm only human, okay?

25:04.897 --> 25:06.664
We hit it off.
She pulled me in here.

25:06.699 --> 25:07.766
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

25:07.800 --> 25:09.467
Restrain yourself.
I don't know.

25:09.502 --> 25:11.069
Break up with Becca.
Take your pick.

25:11.103 --> 25:12.603
Life is messy, man.
Okay?

25:12.638 --> 25:13.971
Sometimes shit happens.

25:14.006 --> 25:15.106
That's the best you've got?

25:15.140 --> 25:16.407
"Shit happens"?

25:16.442 --> 25:18.743
You know what, you are
such a fucking hypocrite, Hank.

25:18.777 --> 25:20.411
You put Karen and Becca
through more shit

25:20.446 --> 25:22.347
than I can dream up and fit
into one fucking screenplay,

25:22.381 --> 25:23.915
and here you are, standing here,

25:23.949 --> 25:25.784
giving me fucking life lessons?

25:25.818 --> 25:26.918
You know, face it,

25:26.953 --> 25:29.254
I am a better, younger version of you,

25:29.288 --> 25:32.357
so just fuck off, old man.

25:41.267 --> 25:43.567
Jesus. What is that,
a fucking buffalo back there?

25:46.606 --> 25:48.407
What the fuck, man?
Hey, Hank!

25:48.441 --> 25:51.910
Hey! What the fuck
are you doing, man?

25:51.945 --> 25:53.011
Hank!

25:53.045 --> 25:54.679
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

25:54.713 --> 25:57.849
No!

25:57.883 --> 26:00.351
Come on!
Stop it!

26:00.385 --> 26:02.720
Christ.
What are you doing?

26:17.266 --> 26:20.902
Charlie Runkle, you know
how to throw a party, man.

26:20.936 --> 26:24.606
Oh, thank you.

26:26.175 --> 26:29.044
