WEBVTT

00:04.805 --> 00:08.008
(upbeat music playing)

00:13.514 --> 00:15.516
(tires screeching)

00:21.189 --> 00:23.257
Sorry to cut your
evening short, ladies.
Don't be.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.158
Who's this high-value fugitive?

00:24.192 --> 00:25.293
Hans Mattis.

00:25.326 --> 00:26.560
GREGORIO:
Hit man, right?

00:26.594 --> 00:27.795
Prime suspect
in the assassination

00:27.828 --> 00:28.896
of that SEAL commander.

00:28.929 --> 00:31.332
Yeah, Mattis arrived
at the airport under an alias.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.201
Homeland caught him
on surveillance.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.468
He took a cab

00:34.502 --> 00:36.204
and was dropped off here
ten minutes ago.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.206
So he's close.
Yeah, and dangerous.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.108
All right, we got
to get a visual on him

00:40.141 --> 00:41.809
and follow him.
Is Pride coming?

00:41.842 --> 00:43.311
He's coordinating with Homeland.

00:43.344 --> 00:44.812
He'll be here soon.
Let's gear up.

00:44.845 --> 00:45.746
No body armor, Sebastian.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.248
We need to blend in.
Right.

00:47.281 --> 00:49.650
Look, we're gonna have
to split up, all right?

00:49.683 --> 00:50.818
Keep the comms open.

00:50.851 --> 00:52.186
If you spot Mattis,

00:52.220 --> 00:53.687
don't engage unless provoked.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.189
Understood?
Got it.

00:55.223 --> 00:56.224
Let's roll.
Okay.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.193
I-I'll just go this way.

00:59.227 --> 01:01.229
*

01:19.880 --> 01:22.316
SEBASTIAN:
Suspect spotted on Toulouse.

01:22.350 --> 01:24.285
Ah, he made me.

01:24.318 --> 01:25.619
He's heading east down...
(car horn honks)

01:25.653 --> 01:27.521
he's heading east down Royal.
I'm in pursuit.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.557
All right, keep your distance.
On our way.

01:31.392 --> 01:32.426
(tires screech)

01:32.460 --> 01:34.595
(horn honks)
MAN: Hey!

01:34.628 --> 01:36.830
*

01:36.864 --> 01:38.232
I'm on St. Peter.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.471
Federal agent! Freeze!

01:46.540 --> 01:48.409
Where are you, Sebastian?

01:48.442 --> 01:49.477
SEBASTIAN (over comms):
Mattis ducked down an alley.

01:49.510 --> 01:50.644
I'm in pursuit.

01:50.678 --> 01:51.879
SONJA:
What alley, Sebastian?

01:51.912 --> 01:53.314
Where are you?

01:53.347 --> 01:54.848
GREGORIO:
Hold up! Wait for backup.

01:54.882 --> 01:57.185
SEBASTIAN:
Oh, my God. I'm taking fire!

01:57.218 --> 01:58.852
Where, Sebastian? Where?

01:58.886 --> 01:59.853
SEBASTIAN:
Stop! NCIS!

01:59.887 --> 02:01.322
(two gunshots)

02:01.355 --> 02:02.390
(gasps)

02:02.423 --> 02:04.192
(bystanders screaming)

02:13.434 --> 02:14.435
Sebastian.

02:14.468 --> 02:15.469
You all right?

02:19.473 --> 02:21.242
He's dead.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.410
That's not Mattis.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.313
He had a gun.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.480
He had a gun,
he was gonna shoot me.

02:26.514 --> 02:29.450
Okay, okay.
So, then, where's the gun?

02:29.483 --> 02:30.351
WOMAN:
Dave?! Dave!

02:30.384 --> 02:32.353
Dave!
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.455
What are you doing?
Dave? Dave!

02:34.488 --> 02:36.657
Get her out
of here.
Dave, no!

02:36.690 --> 02:39.227
Dave!
Dave!

02:40.594 --> 02:42.930
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:42.963 --> 02:45.766
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

02:45.799 --> 02:48.269
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:48.302 --> 02:49.570
* How, how, how, how

02:49.603 --> 02:51.939
* Hey, hey

02:57.778 --> 02:58.946
* You gotta come on.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.952
(siren wailing)

03:07.855 --> 03:09.857
(sobbing)

03:12.360 --> 03:14.362
(indistinct radio chatter)

03:15.763 --> 03:17.965
Don't torture yourself,
Sebastian.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.567
That's-that's his wife.
Should I say something?

03:19.600 --> 03:20.768
No.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.236
Let NOPD do their job.

03:22.270 --> 03:24.872
You find, uh,
you find gunshot residue on him?

03:24.905 --> 03:27.908
You know we can't
talk about this.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.743
I saw you swab his hands,
though.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.845
Yeah, too early to be sure.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.481
That's a no.

03:34.882 --> 03:38.419
Just... just tell me
that you found something. Okay?

03:38.452 --> 03:40.854
Please.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.424
Some fibers,
maybe a little plastic,

03:43.457 --> 03:45.526
under the fingernails.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.861
And again, we can't
be talking about this.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.897
Sebastian.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.800
I've been speaking with every
NOPD officer on the scene.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.369
They know how important it is
to recover that missing weapon.

03:55.403 --> 03:57.738
Okay. I'm gonna wrap this up.

03:57.771 --> 04:00.808
Then I'm gonna take
you home, Sebastian.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.647
You okay?

04:06.680 --> 04:08.516
I was, uh, I was
in pursuit of Mattis

04:08.549 --> 04:10.284
through the-the courtyard.

04:10.318 --> 04:13.954
He ducked into this alley,
then, uh, he took a shot at me

04:13.987 --> 04:15.523
as I was rounding...

04:15.556 --> 04:17.991
I tried to round
the corner.

04:18.025 --> 04:20.928
Then I felt a bullet
whiz past my head, but...

04:20.961 --> 04:22.563
But, Sebastian...

04:22.596 --> 04:24.598
are you okay?

04:26.066 --> 04:27.968
No.

04:28.001 --> 04:30.704
I-I shot someone.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.873
I know.

04:34.742 --> 04:38.011
I, uh, moved over
to... to this corner

04:38.045 --> 04:39.813
and I identified myself.

04:39.847 --> 04:40.981
That's when
I saw the gun.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.517
He was, he was
pointing it right at me

04:43.551 --> 04:45.052
and I took two shots,
but it wasn't Mattis.

04:45.085 --> 04:46.754
They said his name was
Dave Dawson.

04:46.787 --> 04:47.888
(sobbing): No, please,
please, please, please, no!

04:47.921 --> 04:49.923
No!

04:51.625 --> 04:53.861
What did I do?

04:53.894 --> 04:56.430
You did what
you were trained for.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.067
All right?

05:00.100 --> 05:01.402
Let's get you out of here.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.837
Get you
away from this.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.072
SEBASTIAN:
So what now?

05:05.105 --> 05:06.940
PRIDE:
You go home.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.910
You're on administrative duty
until NOPD clears the scene

05:09.943 --> 05:11.111
and FBI starts
their investigation.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.980
FBI?

05:13.013 --> 05:14.415
It's routine.

05:14.448 --> 05:15.816
And it's okay.

05:15.849 --> 05:16.984
'Cause you saw a gun.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.520
Yes, I-I did, Pride, I swear.

05:19.553 --> 05:21.088
I know.

05:21.121 --> 05:23.123
GREGORIO:
Hey.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.359
Wade's parked around the corner
waiting for you.

05:25.393 --> 05:26.627
You know, away from the crowd.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.095
Um...

05:28.128 --> 05:31.331
NOPD's gonna need your weapon.

05:34.468 --> 05:37.337
Right.
It's... it's evidence now.

05:38.138 --> 05:40.340
(sighs)

05:44.712 --> 05:45.779
Come on, baby.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.347
Walk you out.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.523
This is on me, King.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.057
We should've went in pairs.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.959
I mean, Mattis is
a dangerous assassin

05:58.992 --> 06:01.462
and Sebastian's still a probie.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.564
Don't Monday morning
quarterback, Christopher.

06:03.597 --> 06:04.932
Y'all did your job.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.734
And we're gonna
continue doing it.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.035
Keep gathering evidence.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.036
SONJA:
Yeah.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.438
That's a problem.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.172
There's no gun
on the scene, King.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.040
And we couldn't find the slug

06:13.073 --> 06:14.975
in the wall where
the bullet should be.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.711
I mean, there's
not even a mark.

06:17.745 --> 06:18.979
Well, what about surveillance?

06:19.012 --> 06:21.148
None of that, either.
No cameras.

06:21.181 --> 06:23.116
All we have
is Sebastian's story.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.886
Well, the gun's got
to be somewhere.

06:25.919 --> 06:28.756
Unless it's not.

06:28.789 --> 06:32.526
It's possible
Sebastian made a mistake.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.430
WADE:
You need to stop
obsessing about this.

06:36.464 --> 06:38.932
Honestly, I-I don't think
that I can.

06:38.966 --> 06:41.435
I mean, every time I
close my eyes, I just...

06:41.469 --> 06:43.437
I see Dave
Dawson's face.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.673
Well, you've been involved
in a shooting, Sebastian.

06:45.706 --> 06:48.509
It's gonna take time
to process.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.077
Okay, I'll make that tea.

06:52.112 --> 06:55.148
I just... You know, all
that-that FLETC training

06:55.182 --> 06:57.084
and the manuals
and the target practice...

06:57.117 --> 07:00.521
I had no idea that it would,
it would feel like this.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.490
How could you have?

07:02.523 --> 07:04.992
Training isn't real.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.226
It doesn't take into account

07:06.259 --> 07:07.895
adrenaline or fear

07:07.928 --> 07:09.530
or a dozen
other variables.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.665
But it prepares you,
like it did last night,

07:11.699 --> 07:13.133
to take action when you need to.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.068
See, that's what
I keep wondering.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.037
You know, did I need to?

07:17.070 --> 07:19.607
Or am I just another one
of those cops

07:19.640 --> 07:21.909
that you see on the news,
who-who overreacted

07:21.942 --> 07:23.143
and made the wrong call?

07:23.176 --> 07:25.178
You defended yourself,
Sebastian.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.780
End of story.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.248
(sighs)

07:28.281 --> 07:30.117
I guess.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.919
Look...

07:31.952 --> 07:34.955
it's gonna take time to cope
with these feelings.

07:34.988 --> 07:38.559
It... it won't happen
this morning.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.561
(Sebastian sighs)

07:40.594 --> 07:43.897
Maybe you need
a little distraction.

07:43.931 --> 07:46.800
Watch a movie
or play a video game.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.103
Yeah, maybe you're right.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.540
Good.

07:52.573 --> 07:53.974
(sighs)

07:54.007 --> 07:57.044
Details of the incident
are forthcoming,

07:57.077 --> 07:59.780
but we can confirm that a man
was shot and killed

07:59.813 --> 08:02.516
last night by a federal agent.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.217
It's being said that
the victim was a tourist.

08:04.251 --> 08:06.153
I cannot confirm
that information yet.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.789
However, as acting mayor,

08:08.822 --> 08:10.524
my promise
to the citizens of New Orleans

08:10.558 --> 08:13.060
is that the truth of what
happened here will come out.

08:17.598 --> 08:20.200
PRIDE:
NOPD had no luck finding
the gun Sebastian saw.

08:20.233 --> 08:22.202
I'm hoping that
you all did better.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.971
Well, we were out there
all morning.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.306
Didn't find a gun or any
evidence there ever was a gun.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.675
Interviewed dozens
of witnesses.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.643
Plenty saw Sebastian
chasing Mattis.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.845
No one saw the shooting,
let alone Dawson with a gun.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.046
But they all agree
on one thing.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.047
They heard two
shots out there.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.215
That's all.

08:35.248 --> 08:36.917
Number of times Sebastian fired.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.919
SONJA: Hey, we're doing
the best we can right now.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.053
If there is a gun,

08:40.087 --> 08:41.154
we'll find it.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.156
We all know how exacting
Sebastian is.

08:43.190 --> 08:46.326
He says he saw a gun,
no ifs about it.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.828
It was there.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.863
We need to go back out
to the crime scene

08:49.897 --> 08:51.565
and reinterview
the witnesses.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.567
All right, we can
do that, but...

08:53.601 --> 08:55.669
Clock is ticking, okay?

08:55.703 --> 08:58.171
High-profile shooting
involving a federal agent.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.140
We've all seen how the media
plays this out.

09:00.173 --> 09:02.643
Conclusions are gonna get
jumped to real soon

09:02.676 --> 09:05.078
if we don't find something
to back up Sebastian's story.

09:05.112 --> 09:06.313
Okay, but there's two dozen cops
out there.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.115
All due respect,
you go out there now,

09:08.148 --> 09:09.149
you're only gonna
get in the way.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.283
SONJA:
We got other problems,

09:10.317 --> 09:11.985
like a hit man
that's still at large

09:12.019 --> 09:13.320
and a trail
that's gone cold.

09:17.825 --> 09:19.292
All right. All right,
what do we know about Mattis?

09:19.326 --> 09:22.596
He's wanted in seven
different countries

09:22.630 --> 09:23.597
for a dozen assassinations.

09:23.631 --> 09:24.765
If he's in New Orleans,

09:24.798 --> 09:25.999
he's got a target here.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.768
Any known accomplices?

09:27.801 --> 09:29.136
He travels with a
forged passport,

09:29.169 --> 09:31.271
gets his equipment in
whatever city he's operating.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.272
He has to have help.

09:32.305 --> 09:33.306
Maybe Dave Dawson.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.208
Dawson's a 37-year-old machinist

09:35.242 --> 09:37.110
out of Fort Worth.
No criminal record.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.847
He and his wife were in town
on a romantic getaway--

09:39.880 --> 09:41.782
the farthest they've been
outside of Texas.

09:41.815 --> 09:44.184
Not exactly international
assassin material.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.186
The only thing Dawson
and Mattis have in common

09:46.219 --> 09:47.688
is that they were
in the same place

09:47.721 --> 09:49.022
at the wrong time last night.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.024
But Dawson pulled a gun
on Sebastian

09:51.058 --> 09:52.359
while he was pursuing
a wanted fugitive.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.327
Now, may be a coincidence,

09:54.361 --> 09:56.630
but it just feels like
there's more to it than that.

09:56.664 --> 09:58.899
And I have a feeling you're
too close to the situation.

09:58.932 --> 09:59.967
Isler.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.268
What are you doing back in town?

10:01.301 --> 10:03.170
And a pleasant hello
to you, too, Percy.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.705
You're here for Sebastian?

10:04.738 --> 10:06.373
Can we have a word?

10:12.212 --> 10:14.047
PRIDE:
Hey.

10:14.081 --> 10:17.184
I want to make this as easy
as possible on all of us.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.285
All right?
Okay.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.287
No games.
No funny business.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.722
We go by the book,
to the letter,

10:21.755 --> 10:23.356
and we get it over with.

10:23.390 --> 10:26.359
D.C. sends a deputy director
to investigate a shooting.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.729
Does that sound
"by the book" to you?

10:28.762 --> 10:33.066
'Cause to me i-it sounds
like an overreaction.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.067
Dwayne.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.368
I'm not a director anymore.

10:36.770 --> 10:39.006
I'm a special agent,
just like you.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.274
They demoted you.

10:41.308 --> 10:44.678
After our Russian misadventure

10:44.712 --> 10:46.279
the last time
I was down here.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.415
Now, they gave me
two options.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.383
Resign or reassign.

10:50.417 --> 10:53.253
And I'm not ready to give up
my career, not yet.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.889
I'm sorry for your troubles,
Raymond.

10:55.923 --> 11:01.128
But I can't say I'm sorry you're
here to work on Sebastian's case

11:01.161 --> 11:02.996
because together
we can clear him fast.

11:03.030 --> 11:06.266
Look, you're not listening to
me. We're not working together.

11:06.299 --> 11:08.802
I'm here under
official capacity

11:08.836 --> 11:11.304
under strict orders:
collect evidence

11:11.338 --> 11:13.306
and hold Special Agent Lund
accountable.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.009
Well, that won't be a problem
'cause Sebastian acted properly.

11:16.043 --> 11:17.778
Yeah, well, for his sake,
I hope you're right.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.279
What do you mean?

11:19.312 --> 11:22.215
That means leave
the Dave Dawson shooting to me.

11:22.249 --> 11:25.485
He could be connected
to our fugitive hit man.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.721
That's why he pulled
a gun on Sebastian.

11:27.755 --> 11:30.390
There's a lot of assumptions
in that statement.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.862
There's something
you need to see.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.933
(sighs)

11:47.007 --> 11:48.876
SEBASTIAN:
Stop! NCIS!

11:50.944 --> 11:53.180
This footage was shot
behind Dawson's back.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.381
You can't see a gun here.

11:54.414 --> 11:55.315
Play it again.

11:55.348 --> 11:56.516
Slow motion.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.451
(slowed):
NCIS!

12:02.022 --> 12:03.791
Play it as many times you want
at any speed you want.

12:03.824 --> 12:04.925
You still won't see a gun.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.359
Doesn't mean
it's not there.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.795
We got another
big problem.

12:07.828 --> 12:08.996
This has been viewed

12:09.029 --> 12:10.397
over 25,000 times already.

12:10.430 --> 12:11.664
It's going viral.

12:11.698 --> 12:15.268
Federal agent shoots an unarmed
tourist in the French Quarter.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.170
I don't need to tell you
the damage that this footage...

12:17.204 --> 12:18.772
No, you don't.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.255
PRIDE: Did you get some rest?
SEBASTIAN: Not really.

12:35.288 --> 12:37.124
You know, there's
a lot on my mind,

12:37.157 --> 12:38.992
like what's about
to happen in here.

12:39.026 --> 12:40.427
Nothing to worry about.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.395
Isler is gonna ask you some
questions, you'll answer 'em.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.897
Any advice on
how to answer?

12:43.931 --> 12:45.298
Honestly, Sebastian,
that's how.

12:45.332 --> 12:46.934
Nice to see you again,
Special Agent Lund.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.335
I'm sorry it's under
these circumstances.

12:51.071 --> 12:53.073
You're welcome to watch
from observation.

12:59.947 --> 13:01.148
You're nervous?

13:01.181 --> 13:03.016
SEBASTIAN:
Yeah, I am. I'm sorry.

13:03.050 --> 13:05.152
ISLER:
It'd be weird if you weren't.

13:05.185 --> 13:08.321
Now...

13:08.355 --> 13:12.893
in your own words,
what happened last night?

13:12.926 --> 13:16.163
Okay, um, it was
a surveillance operation

13:16.196 --> 13:18.398
of Hans Mattis
in the French Quarter.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.300
Um, the suspect made me
and then fled.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.069
I chased after him.

13:22.102 --> 13:24.137
Um, when I announced myself
as a federal agent...

13:24.171 --> 13:26.406
"Hans Mattis took
a shot at you.

13:26.439 --> 13:29.509
You pursued him into an alley
where you shot Mr. Dawson."

13:29.542 --> 13:31.845
It's from your official
statement, Special Agent Lund.

13:31.879 --> 13:34.347
I want to know what happened.

13:34.381 --> 13:37.217
I... I don't understand.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.889
I remember being
in your shoes.

13:41.922 --> 13:45.492
Was fresh out of Quantico,
my first pursuit,

13:45.525 --> 13:48.061
chasing the suspect,
adrenaline starts pumping,

13:48.095 --> 13:49.362
the bullet starts flying,

13:49.396 --> 13:51.431
and your whole world
turns upside down.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.400
Yeah, that sounds
about right.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.936
You say that Hans Mattis
took a shot at you,

13:55.969 --> 13:58.872
but you don't actually remember
seeing that happen, do you?

13:58.906 --> 14:00.974
No. I-I felt the bullet
pass by my ear,

14:01.008 --> 14:03.510
but I didn't see Mattis
pull the trigger, no.

14:03.543 --> 14:04.945
So, you turned into an alley,

14:04.978 --> 14:06.646
having just barely escaped
a bullet to your head,

14:06.679 --> 14:09.116
you say Mr. Dawson
was holding a gun on you.

14:09.149 --> 14:10.951
Yeah, he was.
You sure?

14:10.984 --> 14:13.954
I am.
As sure as you are that
Hans Mattis took a shot at you

14:13.987 --> 14:15.022
in the first place?

14:15.055 --> 14:17.290
I mean, I-I know what I saw.

14:17.324 --> 14:21.461
I assume...
that you have seen this.

14:21.494 --> 14:24.031
Stop! Freeze!

14:24.064 --> 14:26.033
Yeah, I've seen that.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.001
You don't see the gun,
but-but Dawson has it.

14:28.035 --> 14:30.303
See, that's the problem.

14:33.506 --> 14:34.975
I have forensic
analysis here.

14:39.012 --> 14:41.949
No GSR, no bullet casing,
no slug.

14:41.982 --> 14:45.052
I have two dozen
witness statements.

14:45.085 --> 14:48.655
No one saw Dave Dawson
with a gun, except you.

14:48.688 --> 14:50.924
You, Sebastian,
the one person who shouldn't

14:50.958 --> 14:51.959
be expected
to remember this.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.994
I'm telling you,
Dawson had a gun.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.429
And the evidence
doesn't support that.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.365
From what I see,
or more precisely,

14:58.398 --> 15:00.968
what I don't see here,
it appears

15:01.001 --> 15:02.602
that no one fired on you.

15:02.635 --> 15:04.637
It's not true.

15:04.671 --> 15:07.107
Are you willing to swear to that
under oath in front of a jury?

15:07.140 --> 15:09.977
A jury? Are y... are you
bringing me up on charges?

15:10.010 --> 15:13.113
I'm collecting facts.
And the facts say

15:13.146 --> 15:14.581
that you shot a man
who appears to be unarmed.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.116
And if that holds up,

15:16.149 --> 15:17.650
you will absolutely
be brought up on charges.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.452
Nothing anyone
can do about that.

15:19.486 --> 15:23.390
Wh... wh-what does that mean?

15:23.423 --> 15:25.458
It means that until
this inquiry is resolved,

15:25.492 --> 15:28.261
NCIS has authorized me

15:28.295 --> 15:30.130
to collect your badge.

15:50.017 --> 15:51.451
What the hell was that?

15:51.484 --> 15:53.020
I'm surprised I made it
out of the squad room

15:53.053 --> 15:54.087
without you jumping me.

15:54.121 --> 15:55.688
You just ambushed
Sebastian.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.090
I was just doing my job.

15:57.124 --> 15:58.391
I got nothing personal
against your boy.

15:58.425 --> 16:01.094
That was all kinds
of personal.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.595
Lund is green
in the field.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.331
He was in a heightened
situation, alone,

16:04.364 --> 16:05.732
without backup.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.767
He was scared and he
shot an unarmed man.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.702
Now, that's not personal;
that's reality.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.538
You need to back off.
Why?

16:11.571 --> 16:14.407
Because we worked a few cases
together, bent a few rules,

16:14.441 --> 16:16.276
because cops look out
for cops, why?

16:16.309 --> 16:17.710
Because Sebastian
says Dawson was armed

16:17.744 --> 16:19.079
and I'm gonna prove it.

16:19.112 --> 16:21.448
Pride, no...
Pride, Pride.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.551
You're gonna pursue
your missing assassin

16:24.584 --> 16:26.353
and you're gonna leave
the Dawson shooting alone.

16:26.386 --> 16:27.787
Do you hear me?
I know what this is.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.123
You're pissed at me, right?
You lost your job.

16:30.157 --> 16:31.458
You think it's my fault.
That's fine.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.692
But leave Sebastian
out of this.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.161
Hey, hey, I'm not the
one that you need

16:34.194 --> 16:35.162
to be worried about here.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.164
What do you mean by that?

16:38.231 --> 16:41.134
That means stay out of my way.

16:41.168 --> 16:44.371
Now, you want to help Lund,
you get him a good lawyer.

16:44.404 --> 16:45.772
You stay in your lane

16:45.805 --> 16:48.175
and do not interfere
in my investigation.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.713
Where's Sebastian?

16:53.746 --> 16:55.615
He ducked out
when you chased after Isler.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.250
Didn't say a word
about the interview,

16:57.284 --> 16:58.318
but I'm guessing
it didn't go well.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.053
We've been officially warned

17:00.087 --> 17:02.089
off the Dawson investigation.

17:02.122 --> 17:04.357
Wait, so we're supposed to stop
trying to clear Sebastian?

17:04.391 --> 17:06.293
No. We'll do it on the QT,
right, Pride?

17:06.326 --> 17:08.195
Well, we're not giving up.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.330
We're also not gonna get
in the FBI's way,

17:10.363 --> 17:12.265
officially or unofficially.

17:12.299 --> 17:14.267
Well, whatever we're gonna
do, we'd better do it fast.

17:14.301 --> 17:15.402
The video
of Sebastian shooting

17:15.435 --> 17:18.105
is spreading like wildfire.

17:18.138 --> 17:19.706
The city is gonna start
calling for his head.

17:19.739 --> 17:23.210
And if I'm right and Dawson
is connected to Hans Mattis...

17:23.243 --> 17:24.411
We find Mattis,
we prove the connection.

17:24.444 --> 17:25.712
And exonerate Sebastian.

17:25.745 --> 17:26.746
LASALLE:
Finding Mattis

17:26.779 --> 17:28.348
is the problem.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.716
Patton's been going
through surveillance cameras

17:29.749 --> 17:31.284
in the Quarter all day, no luck.

17:31.318 --> 17:32.685
That's Mattis' M.O.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.254
Got a well-protected target

17:34.287 --> 17:36.089
impossible to get,
Mattis is your guy.

17:36.123 --> 17:37.590
He slips in, he slips out.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.726
I mean, how is it this guy
never leaves any evidence?

17:39.759 --> 17:41.228
He's like a ghost.

17:41.261 --> 17:42.162
But he's not a ghost.
He's a man.

17:42.195 --> 17:44.231
And every man leaves a trace,

17:44.264 --> 17:45.398
especially when you
disrupt his plan.

17:45.432 --> 17:46.599
Give me good news, P.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.235
Surveillance cameras
came up nil,

17:48.268 --> 17:49.836
so I dove into the NOPD's

17:49.869 --> 17:51.438
radio chatter
after the shooting.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.273
I figured someone
might've reported Mattis

17:53.306 --> 17:54.541
fleeing the scene.
You got a hit?

17:54.574 --> 17:56.276
Not on Mattis
but on a black Camry

17:56.309 --> 17:58.311
that was stolen two
blocks from the scene.

17:58.345 --> 18:00.313
What, you think
Mattis stole the car?

18:00.347 --> 18:02.182
If that's the case, he'd be
halfway to Mexico by now.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.351
No, actually,
he's still in New Orleans.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.453
NOPD's license plate reader
just tagged

18:06.486 --> 18:08.288
the black Camry in the Marigny.

18:08.321 --> 18:10.257
Plate doesn't match
make or model.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.159
Got to be Mattis.
Steals a car and changes

18:12.192 --> 18:14.361
the plates to a different one
to cover his tracks.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.329
If he stuck around
knowing we're chasing him,

18:16.363 --> 18:18.198
he could be staying
to complete his mission.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.666
Then we got to stop him
from pulling that trigger.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.501
Where's the car now, Patton?

18:21.534 --> 18:23.703
On Esplanade.
Let's roll.

18:29.376 --> 18:31.478
MAN:
Yo, check it out.

18:31.511 --> 18:32.712
It's NCIS.

18:32.745 --> 18:34.781
What y'all doing here?

18:34.814 --> 18:36.816
Sir, gonna have to
ask you to move on.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.218
No way.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.353
Listen,
we're on official business,

18:40.387 --> 18:41.188
so we'll need you to leave.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.223
MAN:
Or what?

18:43.256 --> 18:44.524
You gonna shoot me?

18:44.557 --> 18:46.193
Come on, everybody,
get your phones out.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.361
Gregorio, forget about it.
Help us out with the car.

18:48.395 --> 18:49.329
We're not gonna forget
about what's going on.

18:49.362 --> 18:50.897
Everyone needs to see this.

18:50.930 --> 18:53.266
Car's engine is still warm.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.701
All right, search the area. He's
got to be around here somewhere.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.436
Yeah, it's gonna be a problem
with our little fan club

18:56.469 --> 18:57.937
over here.
MAN:
Come on, man,
take your phone out.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.572
They're up to something.

18:59.606 --> 19:02.375
All right, everyone,
you need to disperse now.

19:02.409 --> 19:03.576
We're not going anywhere.

19:03.610 --> 19:04.744
This is not a request.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.579
There's a dangerous fugitive

19:06.613 --> 19:08.648
in the area.
Yeah. You.

19:08.681 --> 19:11.918
Okay, you made your point.
You got your videos.

19:11.951 --> 19:14.621
Please move
before anybody gets...

19:14.654 --> 19:15.888
WOMAN: Get out,
get out, get out!

19:15.922 --> 19:17.790
(woman screams)

19:17.824 --> 19:21.194
Get out of the way!
Out of the way!

19:25.232 --> 19:26.333
Go up.

19:26.366 --> 19:27.634
Come on,
come on, come on.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.269
Let's go. Everybody out.

19:29.302 --> 19:32.305
Quick. Shh, shh, shh, quiet.

19:41.314 --> 19:42.949
If Mattis was here,
he's gone now.

19:42.982 --> 19:46.386
Yeah, he was here, all right.

19:46.419 --> 19:47.920
King.

19:47.954 --> 19:50.390
Come take a look at this.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.464
PRIDE:
Laura Dawson.

19:57.497 --> 19:58.865
Dave Dawson's widow.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.667
GREGORIO:
Why would Mattis

20:00.700 --> 20:01.768
kill Dawson's wife?

20:01.801 --> 20:02.835
'Cause Pride's right.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.371
Dawson's connected to Mattis.

20:04.404 --> 20:06.939
Still no idea why.

20:06.973 --> 20:10.310
But we're one step closer
to clearing Sebastian's name.

20:21.621 --> 20:24.291
Laura Dawson's throat
was slit from ear to ear,

20:24.324 --> 20:25.758
severing her carotid artery.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.560
She bled out instantly.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.696
Gonna assume you didn't find
any forensic evidence

20:29.729 --> 20:31.831
pointing to our missing hit man,
Mattis?

20:31.864 --> 20:34.467
Aside from expert knife work,
no.

20:34.501 --> 20:38.471
Uh, I did, however,
find trace fibers

20:38.505 --> 20:40.573
underneath
Mrs. Dawson's fingernails,

20:40.607 --> 20:43.543
similar to that of the ones
found on her husband's body.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.544
What kind of fibers?

20:44.577 --> 20:46.646
Some sort of industrial plastic,

20:46.679 --> 20:48.348
but without Sebastian,

20:48.381 --> 20:49.682
I had to send the sample

20:49.716 --> 20:51.284
to outside experts
for more details.

20:51.318 --> 20:53.353
Be nice to get
him back, Dwayne.

20:53.386 --> 20:54.654
Working on it, Loretta.

20:57.957 --> 21:00.627
NOPD cordoned off
a mile radius of the crime scene

21:00.660 --> 21:01.894
after we found Mrs. Dawson.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.530
Mattis still managed
to escape.

21:03.563 --> 21:04.964
We were on top of them,
how did they get away again?

21:04.997 --> 21:06.699
Well, the lookie-loos
didn't help.

21:06.733 --> 21:08.935
Mattis could have slipped
off into the crowd.

21:08.968 --> 21:11.838
Why would he go
out of his way

21:11.871 --> 21:13.306
to kill Dawson's wife?

21:13.340 --> 21:14.941
No idea, but it makes
the connection

21:14.974 --> 21:16.376
between Dawson and Mattis.

21:16.409 --> 21:17.810
Yeah, but it's not enough
to prove

21:17.844 --> 21:19.746
Sebastian was justified
in shooting him.

21:19.779 --> 21:20.880
We need evidence.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.949
Like the gun Sebastian
saw Dawson holding.

21:22.982 --> 21:26.653
All right, well, what if
Laura took the gun?

21:26.686 --> 21:28.054
In the chaos of
the shooting last night?

21:28.087 --> 21:29.856
Well, I was at the scene, King.

21:29.889 --> 21:30.890
I mean, she didn't go
within ten feet

21:30.923 --> 21:32.659
of her husband's body.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.694
Yeah, but you weren't there
when he went down.

21:34.727 --> 21:36.062
The gun could have
skittered in her direction.
Even if she took it,

21:36.095 --> 21:37.897
she would have tossed it
as soon as she had a chance.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.666
Well, maybe she never
had the chance.

21:39.699 --> 21:42.068
She was with the police
all day being interviewed.

21:42.101 --> 21:43.770
They wouldn't have gone
through her purse.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.838
And then she was escorted
back to her hotel

21:45.872 --> 21:46.973
just before we showed up.

21:47.006 --> 21:48.941
Is that why Mattis
went to her room?

21:48.975 --> 21:51.911
What's so special about this gun
to risk getting caught?

21:51.944 --> 21:53.580
Well, Mattis has a job in town.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.081
That's why he's still here.

21:55.114 --> 21:57.484
And if he killed Laura Dawson
for that gun,

21:57.517 --> 21:59.952
it means he might need it
to complete his mission.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.588
A lot of ifs and maybes.

22:01.621 --> 22:02.822
So let's prove it.

22:02.855 --> 22:04.991
Somebody out there has
a target on their back,

22:05.024 --> 22:07.960
somebody worthy
of Mattis' skill set.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.830
Means a VIP. High security.

22:10.863 --> 22:13.500
We'll look for matches.
Yeah, I'll dig into
the Dawsons again

22:13.533 --> 22:14.667
and see if we can find
a connection to Mattis.

22:14.701 --> 22:16.603
No, leave the Dawsons
out of it.

22:16.636 --> 22:18.505
Isler made it clear
it's not our case.

22:18.538 --> 22:19.939
We'll honor that. Understood?

22:19.972 --> 22:21.941
Yes.
All right.
Yeah.

22:21.974 --> 22:23.976
Thank you.
Miss Loretta.

22:26.045 --> 22:27.146
Something tells me

22:27.179 --> 22:29.148
you're not gonna leave
the Dawsons alone.

22:29.181 --> 22:32.018
Sebastian said
there was a gun.

22:32.051 --> 22:35.021
But there's
no forensic evidence.

22:35.054 --> 22:38.024
Going back to
that crime scene.

22:38.057 --> 22:42.695
NOPD and FBI forensic agents
were all over that scene.

22:42.729 --> 22:44.531
What do you think
you're gonna find?

22:44.564 --> 22:46.132
Not me. Sebastian.

22:46.165 --> 22:48.701
He's the one expert who
hasn't been all over it

22:48.735 --> 22:50.437
and the only one I trust.

22:50.470 --> 22:53.039
Sebastian's shaken up,
Dwayne, and you know that.

22:53.072 --> 22:54.874
And I don't blame him.

22:54.907 --> 22:58.578
There's video of the shooting
on loop everywhere he turns.

22:58.611 --> 23:00.413
I know, Loretta.
I'm sure he feels

23:00.447 --> 23:02.482
like the entire city's
turned against him,

23:02.515 --> 23:04.050
like they just see
him as another cop

23:04.083 --> 23:06.919
with an itchy
trigger finger...

23:06.953 --> 23:09.055
What?

23:09.088 --> 23:11.624
The city doesn't know him
like we do.

23:12.759 --> 23:15.962
Maybe that's something
I can help with.

23:23.970 --> 23:26.839
Timing couldn't be worse
for a surprise visit, Loretta.

23:26.873 --> 23:28.140
Husband and wife tourists
were murdered

23:28.174 --> 23:29.609
within a day
of each other.

23:29.642 --> 23:31.110
I need to make
a statement.

23:31.143 --> 23:33.813
Husband hasn't been
ruled a murder yet.

23:33.846 --> 23:36.849
I'm not so sure they're
tourists, so keep that in mind.

23:41.120 --> 23:44.691
You've come to convince me
that Special Agent Lund's

23:44.724 --> 23:47.159
not liable
for Dave Dawson's killing.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.762
No, that's
not my place, Zahra.

23:49.796 --> 23:53.600
I've come to convince you not
to prosecute him on television.

23:53.633 --> 23:55.167
You've seen the video?

23:55.201 --> 23:57.870
Your friend shot
an unarmed man.

23:57.904 --> 24:01.207
I know what it looks like,
but it's not the full story.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.775
It's a familiar one these days.

24:02.809 --> 24:04.677
Dawson was a machinist;
his wife, a bookkeeper.

24:04.711 --> 24:06.078
They were on vacation.

24:06.112 --> 24:08.180
Got caught in your
friend's crosshairs.

24:08.214 --> 24:09.215
What am I missing?

24:09.248 --> 24:12.084
Laura Dawson wasn't caught
in anyone's crosshairs.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.687
She was killed
by a dangerous person,

24:14.721 --> 24:17.790
an assassin planning to murder
someone else in the city,

24:17.824 --> 24:19.726
the city you're charged
to protect.

24:19.759 --> 24:21.928
We think the Dawsons
were connected.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.930
Of course, you can prove this?

24:25.097 --> 24:28.034
A lot of people are angry,
Loretta.

24:28.067 --> 24:29.536
I'm angry.

24:29.569 --> 24:31.904
You, of all people,
should understand that.

24:31.938 --> 24:33.105
I do.
There is

24:33.139 --> 24:35.542
a long list of victims
like Dawson,

24:35.575 --> 24:37.243
many of them people of color,

24:37.276 --> 24:39.546
who need us to take a stand.

24:39.579 --> 24:40.246
I'm very aware.

24:40.279 --> 24:42.114
But you don't want me to talk

24:42.148 --> 24:43.750
about the erosion
of public trust.

24:43.783 --> 24:45.552
No, you want me

24:45.585 --> 24:48.721
to spin a tale
about an international assassin.

24:48.755 --> 24:51.123
I want you to stop fanning
the flames

24:51.157 --> 24:53.192
until all the facts are in.

24:53.225 --> 24:55.194
Give Sebastian
the benefit of the doubt.

24:55.227 --> 24:57.029
Because he's your friend.

24:57.063 --> 24:58.264
You're right about
one thing, Loretta.

24:58.297 --> 24:59.866
It's not your place.

24:59.899 --> 25:02.669
You can't come asking
for special consideration.

25:02.702 --> 25:04.671
I'm not asking
for special consideration.
Well, what do you call it, then?

25:04.704 --> 25:07.073
A favor?
A debt because you supported me?

25:07.106 --> 25:08.307
I'm not a dealmaker.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.742
That was my predecessor.

25:09.776 --> 25:11.143
And you see where it put him.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.145
All I want

25:13.179 --> 25:15.548
is for you
to do the right thing.

25:15.582 --> 25:17.550
Never been a challenge before,

25:17.584 --> 25:19.686
until you started running
for mayor.

25:19.719 --> 25:22.889
The right thing's to acknowledge
the public's trust,

25:22.922 --> 25:25.224
hold law enforcement
accountable.

25:25.257 --> 25:29.161
And if you can't see past
your loyalty to your friend,

25:29.195 --> 25:31.230
we've got nothing left
to discuss.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.209
Is anyone staring?

25:43.242 --> 25:45.111
Yeah. Me.

25:45.144 --> 25:46.946
Get in here already.

25:46.979 --> 25:49.782
I'm sorry.
I'm trying not to stand out.

25:49.816 --> 25:53.119
Trying not to stand out kind of
makes you stand out, Sebastian.

25:53.152 --> 25:55.688
I mean, Isler took my badge.
He told you not to pursue
the investigation.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.857
Isler's tied up
with Laura Dawson's murder.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.126
I'll worry about him.
You just worry

26:00.159 --> 26:02.328
about finding evidence
of a gun.
Well, hold on, hold on.

26:02.361 --> 26:04.864
FBI's on the cutting edge
of forensic technology.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.266
High density metal
detectors, sonar imaging.

26:07.299 --> 26:10.002
What if Isler's
right and I'm wrong?

26:10.036 --> 26:13.339
Sebastian, I can't be the only
one here who believes you.

26:13.372 --> 26:15.274
You got to believe in you, too.

26:17.376 --> 26:19.979
All right?
Let's walk the scene.

26:20.012 --> 26:23.816
Not as a participant in
a shooting but as a scientist.

26:23.850 --> 26:25.852
We're missing something.

26:29.355 --> 26:30.723
(sniffs)

26:30.757 --> 26:34.160
Okay, so, uh...

26:34.193 --> 26:35.828
I was chasing Mattis.

26:35.862 --> 26:38.865
I came around
this blind corner here.

26:40.667 --> 26:42.034
That's when I...

26:42.068 --> 26:45.872
I felt the bullet
pass by my ear.

26:45.905 --> 26:47.740
Did you see Mattis shoot?

26:47.774 --> 26:50.309
No, I-I mean,
I didn't see anything.

26:50.342 --> 26:53.312
I-I leapt back for cover, here.

26:53.345 --> 26:56.048
And then everything after that
was-was pure instinct.

26:56.082 --> 26:57.283
I-I moved to this wall,

26:57.316 --> 27:00.286
here, and then I, uh,

27:00.319 --> 27:02.288
I spun around.

27:02.321 --> 27:04.657
And Dawson was right there,

27:04.691 --> 27:08.094
pointing a gun at me.

27:09.128 --> 27:12.098
You did what you had to do.

27:13.132 --> 27:15.234
If Dawson shot at you,

27:15.267 --> 27:17.670
there has to be a bullet.

27:17.704 --> 27:19.706
Why haven't we found it?

27:22.374 --> 27:24.310
The trajectory
of the shot...

27:26.312 --> 27:28.815
...would've had it slamming
into this wall, but-but,

27:28.848 --> 27:30.449
even if it ricocheted,
it would've left some kind

27:30.482 --> 27:33.452
of a strike mark or GSR,
some kind of a...

27:33.485 --> 27:35.922
some kind of a sign.

27:35.955 --> 27:37.189
What is it?

27:39.025 --> 27:40.292
Sebastian.

27:40.326 --> 27:41.761
Of course.

27:41.794 --> 27:43.329
Yeah, we're thinking about this
all wrong.

27:43.362 --> 27:45.364
Those-those forensic experts
and-and their equipment,

27:45.397 --> 27:48.134
they were looking for
a traditional lead slug.

27:48.167 --> 27:52.872
That's why they never found
the bullet.

27:52.905 --> 27:54.907
Because it wasn't made of metal.

27:54.941 --> 27:56.976
(chuckles softly)

27:59.378 --> 28:00.847
Glass bullets.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.081
Say again?

28:02.114 --> 28:03.349
I was shot at

28:03.382 --> 28:05.718
with a glass bullet.

28:05.752 --> 28:08.087
Similar idea to what
sky marshals use on airplanes

28:08.120 --> 28:09.321
so that they don't pierce
the fuselage.

28:09.355 --> 28:11.891
Wouldn't that still leave
gunshot residue
on Dawson's body?

28:11.924 --> 28:14.060
Well, not if he shot at me
with an air-powered gun.

28:14.093 --> 28:16.295
See, these bullets, they're
designed to shatter on impact,

28:16.328 --> 28:18.297
but they can be lethal in the
hands of the right shooter.

28:18.330 --> 28:19.431
Like Mattis.

28:19.465 --> 28:21.300
Okay.

28:21.333 --> 28:23.469
How did Dawson end up
with Mattis' special gun?

28:23.502 --> 28:25.905
Dave Dawson is a machinist,
with a workshop

28:25.938 --> 28:28.440
and materials capable
of manufacturing

28:28.474 --> 28:30.242
a weapon like
we're talking about.

28:30.276 --> 28:31.811
Yeah, actually, we think
that he printed it.

28:31.844 --> 28:33.980
From, uh, graphene
carbon fiber.

28:34.013 --> 28:36.949
That's the trace that Wade
found on the Dawson body.

28:36.983 --> 28:37.817
See, it's stronger
than metal,

28:37.850 --> 28:39.451
but it's easy
to pass through security.

28:39.485 --> 28:40.419
Perfect for our killer.

28:40.452 --> 28:42.388
Mattis goes to meet
the Dawsons in the Quarter

28:42.421 --> 28:43.522
to collect his weapon.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.424
Sebastian gets in the way.

28:45.457 --> 28:48.427
Laura scoops up the gun to
protect her husband and herself.

28:48.460 --> 28:50.429
Mattis kills her
to tie up loose ends,

28:50.462 --> 28:53.032
then takes the gun
to finish the job.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.534
We locate Mattis,
we find the weapon.

28:55.567 --> 28:59.338
Right. So, all you guys need
to do to clear my name

28:59.371 --> 29:01.540
is to catch
an uncatchable assassin

29:01.573 --> 29:04.176
before he uses
an undetectable gun

29:04.210 --> 29:06.412
to kill an unidentified target.

29:08.014 --> 29:10.116
Piece of cake.

29:11.550 --> 29:13.185
Let's get to work.

29:25.164 --> 29:26.866
You took Lund back
to the scene of a shooting

29:26.899 --> 29:28.000
he's being investigated for?

29:28.034 --> 29:29.001
I know it looks bad...

29:29.035 --> 29:30.302
No, I don't think you do.

29:30.336 --> 29:32.839
Or maybe,
maybe you just don't care.

29:32.872 --> 29:35.007
You're operating
under a microscope here.

29:35.041 --> 29:36.342
Every move you make
is being scrutinized.

29:36.375 --> 29:38.344
Dawson was armed,

29:38.377 --> 29:40.346
he shot at Sebastian,
and we found evidence.

29:40.379 --> 29:43.015
No, no, no,
you found a theory.

29:43.049 --> 29:44.383
Glass bullets
and an air-powered gun.

29:44.416 --> 29:45.985
You're gonna need a weapon
to prove it.

29:46.018 --> 29:48.487
Mattis killed Laura
for that weapon.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.157
Which proves a connection
between all of them.
Mm.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.993
Dawson crafted a gun
so that Mattis...
Yeah, so that Mattis

29:54.026 --> 29:55.895
could-could pull off some sort

29:55.928 --> 29:58.197
of high-profile
assassination, yes.
It fits his M.O.

29:58.230 --> 30:00.166
Explains why he's
still in New Orleans.

30:00.199 --> 30:02.534
Yes, and it conveniently clears
Sebastian of any wrongdoing.

30:02.568 --> 30:05.171
You can accuse me of a
lot of things, Raymond.

30:05.204 --> 30:08.174
I bend the rules, I
improvise, I go my own way.
(chuckles): Yeah.

30:08.207 --> 30:11.177
But I would never lie
to protect Sebastian.

30:11.210 --> 30:13.179
If I thought
he wasn't justified,

30:13.212 --> 30:15.915
I would've taken
his badge myself.

30:15.948 --> 30:18.184
Mattis has the gun.

30:18.217 --> 30:19.585
He intends to use it.

30:19.618 --> 30:21.253
Help us stop him.

30:21.287 --> 30:22.922
Save two lives

30:22.955 --> 30:24.924
and take down an internationally
wanted killer.

30:24.957 --> 30:26.893
We can both get a win here.

30:29.228 --> 30:32.831
Clearly, you're about to ask me
for something.

30:34.366 --> 30:38.971
My team's been working nonstop
to locate Mattis' target.

30:39.005 --> 30:41.373
Scoured every piece of chatter
coming in and out of the area.

30:41.407 --> 30:44.576
No high-value VIPs
deserving of a Mattis hit.

30:44.610 --> 30:46.612
At least none that we know of.

30:46.645 --> 30:48.414
Well, if you think I know,
I don't.

30:48.447 --> 30:49.448
But you can find out.

30:49.481 --> 30:51.350
Deputy director
of the FBI

30:51.383 --> 30:53.986
has access to intel
that I don't have.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.521
I'm not a deputy director
anymore,

30:55.554 --> 30:57.023
just a field agent like you.

30:57.056 --> 30:59.658
Who can access the FBI database.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.994
I know it's a big ask...
It's an impossible ask.

31:02.028 --> 31:03.930
Look, even if I wanted to,
my clearance has been revoked.

31:03.963 --> 31:05.664
You're a political animal,
Raymond.

31:05.697 --> 31:08.100
You spent your entire career
cultivating relationships.

31:08.134 --> 31:11.037
You have friends.
Yeah, which I intend to keep.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.272
Unlike you, I still have
a chance of saving my career.

31:13.305 --> 31:15.474
You keep saying things
like that.

31:15.507 --> 31:17.343
Unlock the door, Pride.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.178
You know something
about my career that I don't?

31:19.211 --> 31:21.180
All I know is that this
conversation is over.

31:21.213 --> 31:22.681
Now, unlock the damn door.

31:22.714 --> 31:25.351
We're not done.
This isn't happening, Pride.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.653
I'm not calling in a favor
to save your agent's ass.

31:27.686 --> 31:29.221
You have to.
Why's that?

31:29.255 --> 31:31.057
Because it won't
just save Sebastian.

31:31.090 --> 31:32.925
It'll save Mattis' target, too.

31:32.959 --> 31:35.227
And quite frankly,
Raymond,

31:35.261 --> 31:37.663
it's the right thing to do.

31:40.699 --> 31:42.969
All right.
Back in business.

31:43.002 --> 31:45.004
Got us an I.D.
on Mattis' target.

31:45.037 --> 31:45.972
How'd you come by that, King?

31:46.005 --> 31:47.974
Friends in high places.

31:49.175 --> 31:50.943
GREGORIO:
Colonel Rafiq Kassar.

31:50.977 --> 31:52.111
Who is that?

31:52.144 --> 31:53.312
Former Syrian intelligence
commander.

31:53.345 --> 31:54.546
He cut a deal with the U.S.

31:54.580 --> 31:55.547
PRIDE:
CIA's bringing him

31:55.581 --> 31:58.050
to a black site at a nearby base
for questioning.

31:58.084 --> 31:59.451
Former bosses
must've hired Mattis

31:59.485 --> 32:01.087
to take him out before he talks.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.989
Yeah, where's the colonel now?

32:03.022 --> 32:05.591
On a CIA charter inbound for
Louis Armstrong International.

32:05.624 --> 32:07.659
Landing in 30 minutes.
We need to get
to the airport

32:07.693 --> 32:08.660
and take Mattis down.

32:08.694 --> 32:09.728
Wait, what-- hold on.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.230
That's-that's too risky.

32:11.263 --> 32:12.731
Just contact the pilot,
get him to divert.

32:12.764 --> 32:15.167
No good. Plane's on a closed
circuit communications blackout.

32:15.201 --> 32:17.636
Then, I don't know, h-hack
their communications.

32:17.669 --> 32:19.305
I already tried. It didn't work.

32:19.338 --> 32:21.340
This is our chance to find
the gun and clear you.

32:21.373 --> 32:23.142
I know. It's...

32:23.175 --> 32:24.143
I was thinking about
it, all right?

32:24.176 --> 32:25.978
And-and if one of you guys

32:26.012 --> 32:28.014
gets hurt trying
to get my badge back...

32:28.047 --> 32:29.081
Sebastian, appreciate
the sentiment,

32:29.115 --> 32:30.482
but if we don't
stop Mattis now,

32:30.516 --> 32:32.084
who knows how
much more blood

32:32.118 --> 32:34.386
he'll spill? Let's go.

32:42.194 --> 32:44.363
(security wand beeping)

32:54.240 --> 32:56.108
SONJA: Air traffic control
just cleared

32:56.142 --> 32:57.609
a private jet
for final approach.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.111
LASALLE:
We're still five minutes out.

33:05.117 --> 33:06.085
(tires screech)

33:10.822 --> 33:12.524
Air-powered gun, glass bullets.

33:12.558 --> 33:14.626
Mattis will have to get close
to his target.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.595
There,
Gulfstream taxiing to a stop.

33:35.481 --> 33:36.782
Any sign of Mattis?

33:36.815 --> 33:39.418
Got him! He's behind the nose!

33:39.451 --> 33:42.288
(gunshot)
NCIS! Get him in the car!

33:42.321 --> 33:44.223
(gunshots)

33:44.256 --> 33:45.657
Go, go, go!

33:45.691 --> 33:47.226
(engine revs, tires screeching)

33:50.429 --> 33:51.763
Find him, find him. Go!

33:58.204 --> 33:59.738
What the hell?

33:59.771 --> 34:01.140
Where did he go?
Hey.

34:01.173 --> 34:03.609
Check it out.

34:04.676 --> 34:06.245
We've lost him.

34:23.329 --> 34:25.297
LASALLE:
No sign of this joker, Gregorio.

34:25.331 --> 34:26.732
Copy that, Lasalle.

34:26.765 --> 34:28.767
Mattis must've made it
into the terminal.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.602
I'm inside now.

34:30.636 --> 34:32.638
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

34:51.223 --> 34:53.459
MAN (over P.A.):
Bravo three red, Concourse D.

34:53.492 --> 34:56.795
Bravo three red,
Concourse D.

35:03.502 --> 35:04.870
GREGORIO: Just spotted Mattis,
B Concourse.

35:09.841 --> 35:13.579
Don't move.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.581
That's how you always
get away, huh?

35:15.614 --> 35:17.283
It's pretty clever, actually.

35:17.316 --> 35:19.151
After an
assassination,

35:19.185 --> 35:21.187
the only people who don't get
scrutinized at the scene

35:21.220 --> 35:23.322
are the cops.

35:25.524 --> 35:26.725
Don't.

35:26.758 --> 35:27.793
Put your hands up.

35:29.195 --> 35:30.929
Now!

35:30.962 --> 35:32.898
Get down on your knees.

35:32.931 --> 35:35.867
Move, move.

35:41.840 --> 35:44.176
We've been looking for this.

36:03.795 --> 36:04.963
My phone

36:04.996 --> 36:06.565
has been ringing off the hook.

36:06.598 --> 36:09.835
A whole lot of attaboys.

36:09.868 --> 36:11.737
Can't say I'm surprised.

36:11.770 --> 36:14.606
Agencies across the globe
extending their thanks

36:14.640 --> 36:17.843
to the man who brought down
Hans Mattis.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.245
Ah, apparently,
that's the word going around.

36:19.278 --> 36:20.379
Someone out there decided

36:20.412 --> 36:21.913
to give me all the credit.

36:23.882 --> 36:25.251
All I care about

36:25.284 --> 36:27.953
is giving you Mattis' gun.

36:29.488 --> 36:30.922
Sebastian's shooting is cleared.

36:30.956 --> 36:32.924
He's cleared.

36:32.958 --> 36:36.828
And you... can give him this.

36:38.397 --> 36:39.931
Well, that calls for a toast.

36:39.965 --> 36:43.302
No. Thanks. I'm good.

36:43.335 --> 36:46.204
Looks like everybody won.

36:47.005 --> 36:49.475
And you get to go back
to your bosses a hero.

36:49.508 --> 36:52.478
You know, you were right about
a lot of things here, Pride.

36:52.511 --> 36:54.546
But there was something
that you got wrong.

36:56.315 --> 36:58.850
I didn't come out here to
investigate Sebastian's shooting

36:58.884 --> 37:00.286
to cover my own ass.

37:00.319 --> 37:01.953
I did it to cover yours.

37:03.522 --> 37:08.460
Someone in D.C.
has it out for you.

37:08.494 --> 37:09.861
Someone powerful.

37:09.895 --> 37:12.664
Who expected this whole thing
to go the other way.

37:14.032 --> 37:15.867
I'm guessing you don't know
who it is.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.536
I don't.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.771
But I was told to end your
career, whatever it takes.

37:22.040 --> 37:24.310
That's why you backed me
off the Dawson case.

37:24.343 --> 37:27.313
Looking out for me.

37:27.346 --> 37:28.714
Trying to.

37:28.747 --> 37:29.915
Didn't make it easy.

37:29.948 --> 37:31.417
I do what I have to.

37:31.450 --> 37:33.051
(laughs softly)

37:33.084 --> 37:35.887
Well.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.490
You might want to learn
to make adjustments.

37:38.524 --> 37:41.493
I'm on your side,

37:41.527 --> 37:43.061
but next time
you cross the line,

37:43.094 --> 37:45.431
you won't be able to cross back.

37:47.866 --> 37:49.368
Raymond?

37:50.469 --> 37:52.804
Everyone's going to the bar.

37:52.838 --> 37:55.641
You sure you don't want to give
this back to Sebastian yourself?

37:57.108 --> 37:59.711
It'll mean a lot more
coming from you.

38:02.113 --> 38:04.316
Watch your back.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.656
(guitar playing)

38:12.658 --> 38:15.794
* I was born on the river

38:15.827 --> 38:18.997
* I was born a sinner...

38:19.030 --> 38:21.367
No Dwayne?

38:21.400 --> 38:23.602
No, he's grabbing Sebastian.
But don't worry,

38:23.635 --> 38:25.437
I minored in mixology
at Quantico.

38:25.471 --> 38:26.638
What can I make you?

38:26.672 --> 38:28.374
(both laugh)

38:28.407 --> 38:29.608
I'll have a beer.

38:29.641 --> 38:30.809
And keep 'em coming.

38:30.842 --> 38:32.110
It's been a long couple of days.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.345
Yes, ma'am.

38:33.379 --> 38:35.046
Uh, make that two.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.782
And they're on me.

38:38.584 --> 38:41.019
May I sit with you?

38:41.052 --> 38:42.020
Hmm.

38:42.053 --> 38:44.923
* To wash us all away

38:44.956 --> 38:47.859
* Lord,
come and save us all... *

38:47.893 --> 38:51.797
My people tell me Sebastian
was cleared of any wrongdoing.

38:51.830 --> 38:55.534
Mm-hmm.
And I wanted to look you
in the eye and say

38:55.567 --> 38:57.403
you were right.

38:57.436 --> 38:59.605
* Mississippi risin'...

38:59.638 --> 39:01.873
Thank you.

39:01.907 --> 39:05.611
I also wanted to tell you
I wasn't wrong.

39:05.644 --> 39:08.079
I did what I thought
was best, Loretta.

39:08.113 --> 39:10.048
I held law enforcement
accountable.

39:10.081 --> 39:11.650
And I'd do it again.

39:11.683 --> 39:12.918
You have always been stubborn.

39:12.951 --> 39:14.553
I have.

39:14.586 --> 39:17.556
That's why I need someone
like you around me.

39:17.589 --> 39:19.558
Someone to challenge me.

39:19.591 --> 39:21.427
Give me perspective.

39:21.460 --> 39:24.630
Hmm. And I've always
been contrary.

39:24.663 --> 39:27.566
More than that,
I want you to believe in me

39:27.599 --> 39:30.135
the same way you believe
in Sebastian.

39:30.168 --> 39:33.672
What are you
asking me, Zahra?

39:33.705 --> 39:36.642
Join my campaign.

39:36.675 --> 39:39.445
Help me run for mayor
permanently, help me win.

39:39.478 --> 39:42.414
We could do so much
good for the city.

39:42.448 --> 39:44.516
(laughing):
I'm very flattered.

39:44.550 --> 39:48.019
That's not a yes.

39:48.053 --> 39:51.089
Okay, yes, but I'm not
gonna pull any punches.
Right.

39:51.122 --> 39:53.659
If I think you're wrong,
I'll tell you to your face.

39:53.692 --> 39:56.127
Okay.
And if you go
after my family again...

39:56.161 --> 39:58.430
No, I understand now.

39:58.464 --> 40:01.166
I-I won't make you
choose between us.

40:01.199 --> 40:02.934
Thank you, brother.

40:02.968 --> 40:04.703
All right, who's ready-ready
to get their drink on here?

40:04.736 --> 40:06.672
Hey!
Hey!

40:06.705 --> 40:08.440
Pride said
first round's on him.

40:08.474 --> 40:09.841
Sebastian's got the second round
since we cleared his name.

40:09.875 --> 40:11.477
Where is he, by the way?

40:11.510 --> 40:13.445
Pride's grabbing him,
but they're not here yet.

40:13.479 --> 40:14.680
Guys, I think we're gonna have

40:14.713 --> 40:16.682
to give Sebastian
a little more time.

40:16.715 --> 40:17.949
* Risin', risin'

40:17.983 --> 40:18.850
Yeah.

40:18.884 --> 40:21.152
* Risin', risin'

40:21.186 --> 40:24.456
* Yeah, risin', risin'

40:24.490 --> 40:27.993
* Oh, oh, oh, oh.

40:28.026 --> 40:29.495
(knocking)

40:30.929 --> 40:32.664
Hey.

40:32.698 --> 40:35.567
Hey.

40:35.601 --> 40:37.569
Can I come in?

40:37.603 --> 40:40.105
Oh, yeah. Of course,
yeah, come on in.

40:42.007 --> 40:44.776
I know everyone's probably
waiting for me at the bar.

40:44.810 --> 40:46.177
Obviously, you know,

40:46.211 --> 40:48.113
I'm so grateful
for what you guys did, you know?

40:48.146 --> 40:49.715
I'm just, uh...

40:49.748 --> 40:52.584
Not in the mood to celebrate?

40:52.618 --> 40:53.919
Yeah.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.120
That's okay.

40:55.153 --> 40:58.156
You feel like talking?

41:00.291 --> 41:02.728
It's just, no one
ever mentioned to me

41:02.761 --> 41:04.963
what it would feel
like, you know?

41:04.996 --> 41:08.099
Well, it's not something
you can describe...

41:08.133 --> 41:10.135
or plan for.

41:13.171 --> 41:15.541
You took a life.

41:16.708 --> 41:20.612
No matter how justified,

41:20.646 --> 41:23.615
you carry that weight
with you forever.

41:23.649 --> 41:26.718
Does it get any lighter?

41:29.655 --> 41:32.791
With time,
you learn how to shoulder it.

41:32.824 --> 41:36.227
That much I can promise.

41:39.064 --> 41:43.268
It's a constant reminder
of what this work costs,

41:43.301 --> 41:45.036
why it's important.

41:46.638 --> 41:49.207
Yeah, the responsibility we have

41:49.240 --> 41:52.711
carrying a badge and a gun.

41:52.744 --> 41:55.080
Yeah.

41:56.247 --> 41:58.584
Hmm.

42:01.753 --> 42:04.522
Can you carry that weight,
Sebastian?

42:07.292 --> 42:10.128
Continue to do the job?
