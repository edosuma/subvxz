18:05.818 --> 18:08.721
How is this pretend?!
I'm actually flying, okay?!

18:08.755 --> 18:11.158
But...we're gonna
do great.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.593
We're gonna do great,
'cause I got this.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.628
We're coming in for a nice,
smooth landing.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.299
Whoo!

18:20.567 --> 18:21.901
I love you, Mom.
I love you, too.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.371
And I love you,
Delilah.
Ugh.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.639
Uh, really?
And eye roll now?

18:26.673 --> 18:28.475
Fine.
I love you, too.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.477
No, if you're gonna use that
tone, then what's the point?

18:30.510 --> 18:32.312
Let's everybody
hold hands.
Hey, hey, hey, no!

18:32.345 --> 18:34.214
Hands on the wheel.
You're flying.
God forbid,

18:34.247 --> 18:36.449
we had one moment of closeness
before we die.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.618
Which we're
not going to.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.687
'Cause I am in
full control.

18:41.854 --> 18:44.157
Here we go.
Let's get some.

[ All screaming ]

18:47.494 --> 18:50.330
It's okay!
It's okay!

It's okay! I got this!

[ Engine sputtering ]

19:10.917 --> 19:11.718
[ Thud ]

19:14.221 --> 19:15.555
What do you mean
you can't get me a team?

19:15.588 --> 19:19.292
They are lost.
Two of them are children!

19:19.326 --> 19:21.828
What kind of a dumb-ass hick,
stupid t--

19:21.861 --> 19:23.663
I got to go.

19:23.696 --> 19:26.599
I just called the so-called
USPIS Agency

19:26.633 --> 19:28.535
and they tell me you're on
a mental-health sabbatical.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.570
Now, since I don't want to
get fired for helping

19:30.603 --> 19:33.240
a mental patient, let's just
pretend this little episode

19:33.273 --> 19:34.541
didn't happen.
Do you understand?

19:34.574 --> 19:36.676
There is a plane
crashed out there!

19:36.709 --> 19:38.545
This is Alaska!

19:38.578 --> 19:40.380
There's always a plane
crashed out there.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.382
And when people report
a missing person,

19:42.415 --> 19:47.520
real agencies like mine,
the FBI, will send help.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.889
Until then, you can go back
to whatever loony bin

19:49.922 --> 19:52.592
or yoga retreat that will
get your head right.

19:52.625 --> 19:53.726
Are we clear?

19:53.760 --> 19:54.694

Yes.

Afternoon, ma'am.

20:29.929 --> 20:32.265
We heard you're putting
together a posse.

20:32.299 --> 20:33.766
Yeah, I was.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.736
What are you guys, some crazy
secessionist group?

20:36.769 --> 20:38.538
No, ma'am.
We're the Army.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.740
Alaskan Free State battalion.
First mountain division!

20:40.773 --> 20:42.409
How many divisions
are there?

20:42.442 --> 20:43.576
One.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.345
Well...

20:45.378 --> 20:46.779
I could do worse.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.448
And I could
definitely do better,

20:48.481 --> 20:49.916
but I could certainly
do worse.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.451
Let's roll.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.486
General Carol,
we got ourselves a mission!

Hooah!
