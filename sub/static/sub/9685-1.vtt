Boy, why are you crying?

00:46.296 --> 00:48.798
l was crying because l couldn't
get my shadow to stick.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.509
Besides, l wasn't crying.

00:51.509 --> 00:54.387

01:02.395 --> 01:04.480

01:32.884 --> 01:34.719

01:45.480 --> 01:47.899
l don't ever want to become a man.
Yuck!

01:47.899 --> 01:50.819
l always want to be a little boy
and to have fun.

01:53.488 --> 01:56.491
We wanna be like Peter Pan

01:56.491 --> 01:59.202
We don't wanna grow up

02:01.913 --> 02:03.999
Brad.

02:04.082 --> 02:06.001
I'm at my daughter's play.

02:06.084 --> 02:08.586
Then when it's time to be a man

02:08.711 --> 02:11.506
We're not gonna show up

02:11.589 --> 02:15.010
lt's impossible. I'm on a plane
to London tomorrow night with my family.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.720
A children's hospital--

02:16.803 --> 02:20.390
A children's hospital is dedicating
an entire wing to Granny Wendy.

02:21.808 --> 02:25.395
- Peter, you're missing it.
- All right.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.397
Want a meeting tomorrow, a.m.?

02:27.397 --> 02:30.483
Dad, my game.
You promised.

02:30.608 --> 02:32.610
Listen, it's my son's big game.

02:32.694 --> 02:36.197
Last game of the season, Santa Series.
l gotta be there. l promised.

02:36.197 --> 02:38.908
So, we'll make it a short meeting.

02:38.908 --> 02:41.911
l'll be there.
My word is my bond.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.998
We never, never, never, never

02:45.081 --> 02:48.418
Never, ever wanna grow up
Yuck

02:49.294 --> 02:51.212
Strike three, you're out!

02:58.094 --> 03:01.389
Jack! Come on, Blue Jays!

03:09.814 --> 03:12.609
Where is your father?
He's missing it.

03:12.692 --> 03:16.196
Daddy'll be here.
He promised.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.989
- Jerry, Jack--
- Jim.

03:18.114 --> 03:21.409
l said that. Take the video camera,
go to the game, film what l miss.

03:21.493 --> 03:24.412
-Can l say something?
-Mr. Banning, here's the tribute speech.

03:24.496 --> 03:25.914
- On cards?
- Yes, sir.

03:25.997 --> 03:28.291
- Number those. Who wrote it?
- Ned Miller.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.085
l loved his annual report.
Read it back to me.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.879
''Lord Whitehall, honored guests,
for the past 70 years...

03:33.004 --> 03:34.798
- the Granny Wendy we honor tonight...
- That's nice.

03:34.881 --> 03:38.093
has given hope and care and life
to hundreds of homeless children.''

03:38.218 --> 03:39.386
Great. Very personal.

03:39.511 --> 03:41.596
Mommy, where is Daddy?

03:52.607 --> 03:54.484
- My briefcase--
- Banning.

04:05.286 --> 04:07.914
Well, gotta fly.

04:07.998 --> 04:10.709
Don't worry. More people crash
in cars than on planes.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.919
lt's safer to fly
than crossing the street.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.295
Don't look down.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.714
Well, if it's your time to go,
it's your time to go.

04:16.798 --> 04:20.719
And remember,
don't let your arms get tired!

04:20.719 --> 04:23.013
What if it's
the pilot's time to go?

04:24.097 --> 04:26.516
Come on, keep us alive, Banning!

04:26.599 --> 04:30.687
- Okay, come on!
- Hi, Mrs. Banning! I'm from the office.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.981
- Which one's your son?
- He's up to bat.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.983
Thank you.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.409
Don't look at me. Focus!

04:44.409 --> 04:47.287
Stay focused.
Come on, Jack. One time.

04:52.917 --> 04:55.086
Please not a curve ball.

04:55.086 --> 04:58.298
Mama wants a new pair of shoes.
Drive me home, Jack!

05:04.387 --> 05:06.014
That's a game.

05:16.900 --> 05:20.612
Two, four, six, eight
Who do we appreciate

05:20.612 --> 05:23.406
Blue Jays

05:55.188 --> 05:57.107
Yeah, Brad.
That's real good.

06:04.906 --> 06:08.201
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

06:08.284 --> 06:11.204
Please do not allow
this minor turbulence to disturb you.

06:21.798 --> 06:26.094
For now, please sit back and relax,
and enjoy the remainder of the flight.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.679
Thank you.

06:27.804 --> 06:32.017
- Look what Jack drew.
- That's very nice, dear.

06:32.017 --> 06:34.686
- What's that?
- Fire.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.896
Fire? Really?

06:36.896 --> 06:38.690
- ls that our plane?
- Yep.

06:40.108 --> 06:43.486
- Who are all these people?
- That's Jack, that's me...

06:43.486 --> 06:46.906
that's Mom, and that's you.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.117
Where's my parachute?

06:51.703 --> 06:53.204
I'm not gonna make it
to my next birthday.

06:53.288 --> 06:55.498
You're not gonna die
without a phone and fax machine.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.500
I'm halfway there.
l got the phone in the briefcase.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.918
Talk to him.

07:06.009 --> 07:07.886
Why didn't l have
a parachute, Jackie?

07:08.011 --> 07:09.804
Take a wild guess.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.598
- Jackie--
- Jack.

07:12.891 --> 07:14.809
Will you stop that?
You can break a window.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.895
They're double-layered.
You can't break them.

07:16.895 --> 07:19.105
Give me that.

07:21.399 --> 07:23.902
You're afraid
you're gonna get sucked out.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.403
I'm not afraid
of being sucked out.

07:25.487 --> 07:28.198
Yes, you are. You're afraid
you're going to be sucked out.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.908
Just stop.

07:32.702 --> 07:36.498
Jack, next season I'm coming
to six games. l promise.

07:36.581 --> 07:39.417
Yeah, be sure
to buy enough videotape.

07:40.502 --> 07:43.588
Hey, Jack.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.716
My word is my bond.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.802
Yeah, junk bonds.

07:51.388 --> 07:54.683
What the hell's the matter with you?
When will you stop acting like a child?

07:54.808 --> 07:57.102
l am a child.

07:57.102 --> 07:58.395
Grow up.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.399
lt's been a long time.

08:02.399 --> 08:04.109
Let's have fun, Peter.

08:04.109 --> 08:07.320
London's a magical place for children.
Well, it was for us.

08:07.404 --> 08:10.782
lt's gotten very expensive. Jack, don't.
You could put someone's eye out.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.493
Maggie.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.079
- Peter, it's number 14.
- Oh, 14.

08:16.204 --> 08:19.708
Okay. Now, what do you say to
Granny Wendy? ''How do you do?''

08:19.791 --> 08:22.293
Jack, get down from there.
You'll break your neck. Be careful.

08:22.419 --> 08:26.297
ls Granny Wendy the real Wendy
from my play?

08:26.381 --> 08:28.717
- Not really.
- Sort of.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.595
Don't be a sloucher.
Take that gum out of your mouth.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.097
lt's time to look our best.
Remember, dears:

08:35.097 --> 08:38.684
First impressions are the most
important. Shoes tied, shirt tucked.

08:38.809 --> 08:41.479
Give me this. All right.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.606
Remember, you're in England,
land of good manners.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.693
- Uncle Tootles.
- lt's snowing!

08:58.705 --> 09:00.915
Look at these adorable children!

09:00.999 --> 09:03.710
lt's good to see you,
Libby, Linda-- Lisa!

09:03.793 --> 09:06.588
- Liza.
- l said that.

09:06.588 --> 09:08.298
Moira, how are you?

09:11.301 --> 09:14.679
Look at the size of the--
Look at you, such a big, sweet thing.

09:17.515 --> 09:17.891
- Granny Wendy will be right down.
- She's upstairs? Oh, good.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.188
No baseball.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.190
- Did you do this for us?
- Yes, l did.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.317
- Thank you.
- l've been cooking all week.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.695
What have you been cooking?
Mince pies? Brandy snaps?

09:30.820 --> 09:32.906
Oh, Peter, look at this.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.908
- Who's that?
- lt's you.

09:34.991 --> 09:37.118
- Was l ever that young?
- Yes.

09:37.202 --> 09:40.914
- What's gotten into you?
- Oh, this house has gotten to me.

09:40.997 --> 09:44.417
Some of those things l was
when l was young have never left me.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.712
Oh, thank God, Peter.
We were children in these rooms.

09:47.712 --> 09:50.382
Lost, lost, lost.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.592
Lost what?

09:52.592 --> 09:55.011
l've lost my marbles.

09:56.012 --> 09:59.391
- Okay. Lisa?
- Liza.

09:59.516 --> 10:01.393
Liza. l thought he was
supposed to be in a home.

10:01.518 --> 10:04.479
lt broke Wendy's heart. After all,
Tootles is Wendy's first orphan.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.815
- Which is which?
- The large bag is mine...

10:06.898 --> 10:09.192
that one's Moira's, and
the two smaller ones are the children's.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.694
Hello, boy.

10:19.911 --> 10:21.705
Hello, Wendy.

10:30.505 --> 10:33.508
l told you, Gran,
l'd get him here, by hook or by crook.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.015
Sorry it's been
so long between visits.

10:41.099 --> 10:45.186
lt's been ten years between visits,
but never mind.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.605
Come and give me a squdge.

10:59.617 --> 11:02.787
And this lovely lady can't--
it can't be Maggie.

11:02.912 --> 11:05.290
Yes, it can.
And know what, Great-Grandma?

11:05.415 --> 11:08.918
- l just played you at school.
- And don't you just look the part.

11:09.002 --> 11:09.294
Oh, can this giant be Jack?
How much you've grown in a year.

11:09.294 --> 11:13.298
Oh, can this giant be Jack?
How much you've grown in a year.

11:13.298 --> 11:13.882
l'm supposed to tell you about
congratulations for opening the...

11:13.882 --> 11:18.011
l'm supposed to tell you about
congratulations for opening the...

11:18.011 --> 11:18.303
orphan hospital,
and how great the dedication is.

11:18.303 --> 11:22.307
orphan hospital,
and how great the dedication is.

11:22.307 --> 11:23.892
And-- Yeah.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.311
- Thank you so very much.
- You're welcome.

11:26.311 --> 11:27.103
Now, there is one rule l insist
be obeyed while you are in my house.

11:27.103 --> 11:32.400
Now, there is one rule l insist
be obeyed while you are in my house.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.611
No growing up.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.615
Stop this very instant...

11:38.615 --> 11:41.910
and that includes you,
Mr. Chairman of the Board Banning.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.495
Sorry. Too late, Gran.

11:43.495 --> 11:43.912
And what is so terribly important
about your terribly important business?

11:43.912 --> 11:47.999
And what is so terribly important
about your terribly important business?

11:47.999 --> 11:52.212
Well, you see, when a big company's
in trouble, Dad sails in.

11:52.212 --> 11:55.382
- And if there's any resistance, Dad--
- He's exaggerating.

11:55.382 --> 11:55.715
l'm still into mergers and acquisitions
and l'm dabbling into land development.

11:55.715 --> 11:59.803
l'm still into mergers and acquisitions
and l'm dabbling into land development.

11:59.803 --> 12:02.806
Any resistance,
and he blows them out of the water.

12:06.601 --> 12:07.394
So, Peter, you've become a pirate.

12:07.394 --> 13:16.379
So, Peter, you've become a pirate.

13:16.379 --> 13:17.380
- Peter!
- What?

13:17.505 --> 13:20.091
Brad's on the line.
He says it's urgent.

13:27.015 --> 13:30.101
- Peter, do you like my dress?
- Great, Gran. Real nice.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.104
Thanks.

13:34.189 --> 13:36.107
Brad. Good news?

13:37.609 --> 13:39.611
What?

13:39.694 --> 13:42.489
What Sierra Club report?
l thought we had these guys.

13:44.282 --> 13:48.203
He's trying to suck my blood,
and he drools all over my neck.

13:48.203 --> 13:50.580
- What did they find?
- Peter, that's a portable phone.

13:50.580 --> 13:53.792
- A Cozy Blue Owl?
- There's nine other room in the house.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.919
Well, listen.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.297
Tell them there've always been
casualties of evolution.

13:59.381 --> 14:01.383
Ask them if anybody misses
the Tyrannosaurus Rex.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.510
l do. Boy, do l ever.

14:03.593 --> 14:05.720
Wow. Are you kidding?

14:05.720 --> 14:07.097
Wait a minute. A ten-inch owl
has a 50-mile mating radius?

14:07.097 --> 14:11.101
Wait a minute. A ten-inch owl
has a 50-mile mating radius?

14:11.101 --> 14:14.104
Why don't they just
fornicate someplace else?

14:14.187 --> 14:14.479
A $5 billion deal falling apart
because of this?

14:14.479 --> 14:19.609
A $5 billion deal falling apart
because of this?

14:19.609 --> 14:21.611
Why doesn't somebody just
shoot me in the head?

14:22.320 --> 14:23.780
Bang! Bang!

14:23.905 --> 14:26.616
- Will everybody just shut up!
- l'm sorry.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.493
Leave me alone for one moment.

14:28.618 --> 14:31.287
Moira, get them outta here.
l'm on the phone call of my life.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.916
Come on, Jack. Out.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.294
Come with me.

14:38.420 --> 14:42.215
l'll show you the window where your
father and l used to blow out the stars.

14:45.802 --> 14:48.096
l never should have come. l should
have stayed till the deal was done.

14:48.179 --> 14:51.015
You haven't been here for ten years,
though Granny asked you every year.

14:51.099 --> 14:54.185
- l've been busy.
- You promised the kids some real time.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.980
- l just got here.
- You've done nothing but yell at them.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.482
- That's not true.
- How many more broken promises, Peter?

14:59.607 --> 15:01.609
l'm sorry.

15:06.406 --> 15:09.409
lt's Brad.
l gotta take this call.

15:09.492 --> 15:11.119
l gotta fix this.

15:11.119 --> 15:14.205
No. You've got
to fix your family first.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.007
Peter, hello. Are you there?

15:29.304 --> 15:30.597
What--

15:32.807 --> 15:35.810
- l'm sorry about your deal.
- You hated the deal.

15:35.810 --> 15:39.314
l hated the deal, but l'm sorry
you feel so badly about it.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.109
Your children love you.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.487
They want to play with you.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.697
How long do you think that lasts?

15:48.782 --> 15:51.910
Soon Jack may not even
want you to come to his games.

15:53.411 --> 15:56.706
We have a few special years
with our children...

15:56.790 --> 15:59.918
when they're the ones
that want us around.

16:00.001 --> 16:03.004
After that, you're going to be running
after them for a bit of attention.

16:04.506 --> 16:07.217
lt's so fast, Peter.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.804
lt's a few years,
and then it's over.

16:13.890 --> 16:16.518
And you are not being careful.

16:18.395 --> 16:20.897
And you are missing it.

16:27.404 --> 16:29.280
Peter, where are you?

16:36.913 --> 16:37.497
All children,
except one, grow up.

16:37.497 --> 16:42.794
All children,
except one, grow up.

16:42.794 --> 16:45.880
You know where fairies come from,
don't you, Maggie?

16:46.881 --> 16:51.094
''When the first baby laughed
for the first time...

16:51.094 --> 16:54.097
the laugh broke
into a thousand pieces...

16:54.180 --> 16:56.516
and they all went skipping about.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.685
That was the beginning of fairies.''

16:58.810 --> 17:00.186
And look.

17:02.814 --> 17:04.190
l'm Wendy.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.403
Or was, a long time ago.

17:08.486 --> 17:08.987
But Jack says
you're not the really real Wendy.

17:08.987 --> 17:12.991
But Jack says
you're not the really real Wendy.

17:12.991 --> 17:15.201
Ah, well, you see where Jack is?

17:16.493 --> 17:19.914
Well, that is the same window,
and this is the same room...

17:19.998 --> 17:20.790
where we made up stories about Peter and
Neverland and scary old Captain Hook.

17:20.790 --> 17:24.919
where we made up stories about Peter and
Neverland and scary old Captain Hook.

17:24.919 --> 17:25.211
And do you know, Mr. Barrie--
well, Sir James-- our neighbor...

17:25.211 --> 17:29.299
And do you know, Mr. Barrie--
well, Sir James-- our neighbor...

17:29.299 --> 17:33.511
he loved our stories so much
that he wrote them all down in a book...

17:33.511 --> 17:36.598
oh, dear me, 80 years ago.

17:36.598 --> 17:39.309
You're really old.

17:39.309 --> 17:41.394
That's very true.

17:41.519 --> 17:45.315
l'm sorry l have to break this up,
but l have to steal Granny Wendy...

17:45.315 --> 17:48.485
or she'll be late for the most
important event of her life.

17:52.697 --> 17:53.990
Oh, dear.

17:54.115 --> 17:57.786
Daddy, l made something for you.
You're gonna love this.

17:57.911 --> 18:01.706
lt's a hug. Next time you fly
you won't have to be scared.

18:01.706 --> 18:04.084
She's made you a parachute.

18:04.209 --> 18:06.294
That's very clever, dear.

18:07.587 --> 18:11.216
Jack, get away from there.
What have l told you about open windows?

18:11.299 --> 18:14.511
Keep this window closed.
l've told you this a hundred times.

18:14.511 --> 18:18.682
- Do we have open windows at home?
- No, they've all got bars on them.

18:18.682 --> 18:20.683
Come on, into bed.

18:23.687 --> 18:25.605
Who took my baseball?

18:25.688 --> 18:29.484
That mean, scary man
at the window stole it.

18:29.609 --> 18:29.984
- There's no scary man.
- But he says he's a window washer.

18:29.984 --> 18:35.698
- There's no scary man.
- But he says he's a window washer.

18:35.698 --> 18:38.284
- What is this?
- This is a baseball glove.

18:38.410 --> 18:41.579
You can catch things with it,
take hot things out of the oven...

18:41.705 --> 18:43.206
or hit your sister with it.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.793
Tootles made it for me.

18:46.918 --> 18:49.087
- lt smells nice.
- lt's paper, honey.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.216
Night.

18:56.219 --> 18:58.513
Hey, Jack.

18:58.596 --> 19:00.015
Faker.

19:01.182 --> 19:03.810
Jack, you're in charge now.

19:03.893 --> 19:07.814
This is my very special watch
so you can keep track of the time.

19:07.897 --> 19:10.692
Don't go out, Mom, please.

19:15.613 --> 19:16.990
Good night.

19:25.081 --> 19:29.210
Dear night lights,
protect my sleeping babes.

19:29.210 --> 19:32.589
Burn clear and steadfast tonight.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.304
l read recently that they're
now using lawyers instead of rats...

19:39.387 --> 19:41.306
for scientific experiments.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.100
They do this for two reasons.

19:44.184 --> 19:47.896
One, the scientists become
less attached to the lawyers.

19:49.397 --> 19:52.692
And two, there are certain things
that even rats won't do.

19:59.199 --> 20:02.702
l want to thank the board of trustees
of the Great Ormond Street Hospital...

20:02.786 --> 20:06.289
for having me here this evening,
and beg your forgiveness...

20:06.414 --> 20:09.292
because normally l'm used to
addressing shareholders.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.004
We don't know each other, and l doubt
that we have very much in common...

20:13.004 --> 20:17.092
We don't know each other, and l doubt
that we have very much in common...

20:17.092 --> 20:20.512
except this wonderful woman,
Wendy Angela Darling.

20:23.807 --> 20:26.017
Granny Wendy brought me
in from the cold.

20:26.101 --> 20:28.395
She taught me to read and write.

20:28.520 --> 20:31.606
She even found people
to be my parents and adopt me.

20:33.817 --> 20:35.485
She's loved so many children...

20:35.610 --> 20:36.111
just so efforlet-- effors--
effortlessly.

20:36.111 --> 20:40.198
just so efforlet-- effors--
effortlessly.

20:40.198 --> 20:42.701
That's her achievement.

20:42.784 --> 20:45.620
Many of you here tonight
were once lost children...

20:45.703 --> 20:49.499
but Granny Wendy found parents
and homes for each of you...

20:49.582 --> 20:52.210
and saved you--
that's her miracle.

20:53.420 --> 20:56.715
And l know that if you could stand now
you would express...

20:56.798 --> 21:00.302
much better than l have
your feelings of...

21:00.385 --> 21:01.803
gratitude...

21:04.597 --> 21:06.015
appreciation...

21:08.601 --> 21:11.312
and warm feelings...

21:11.396 --> 21:13.314
for this wonderful woman.

21:28.913 --> 21:31.082
l guess we do have
something in common.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.211
We're orphans.

21:55.315 --> 21:56.816
Hook!

23:17.689 --> 23:19.399
Are you all right?

23:36.916 --> 23:39.085
Thank you, Nigel-- Norman?

23:39.085 --> 23:42.213
- Neville, sir.
- Neville. ls that English?

23:42.297 --> 23:43.882
Merry Christmas.

23:46.009 --> 23:48.219
- l was proud of you.
- Really?

23:48.219 --> 23:50.180
lt was a beautiful speech.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.698
Hello?

24:19.918 --> 24:22.504
My God. The children.

24:27.717 --> 24:30.303
Maggie? Jack, answer me!

24:34.307 --> 24:37.894
The wind came up,
the door closed on me...

24:38.019 --> 24:40.605
and the children were screaming.

24:53.910 --> 24:55.286
The window.

25:08.717 --> 25:12.303
''Dear Peter, your presence is required
at the request of your children.''

25:15.390 --> 25:16.182
''Kindest personal regards,
JAS Hook...

25:16.182 --> 25:20.186
''Kindest personal regards,
JAS Hook...

25:20.186 --> 25:21.813
Captain.''

25:26.609 --> 25:28.611
Have to fly.

25:28.611 --> 25:31.489
Have to fight.
Have to crow.

25:31.489 --> 25:33.992
Have to save Maggie.
Have to save Jack.

25:35.618 --> 25:37.495
Hook is back.

25:38.413 --> 25:39.789
Who?

25:41.082 --> 25:42.584
Gran?

25:47.505 --> 25:51.301
Well, the lab boys
can analyze this little lot.

25:51.384 --> 25:52.719
Mr. and Mrs. Banning, we've wired the
phones, and two men will stay outside.

25:52.719 --> 25:56.806
Mr. and Mrs. Banning, we've wired the
phones, and two men will stay outside.

25:56.806 --> 26:00.685
Of course, it is possible this whole
thing is some kind of ridiculous prank.

26:00.685 --> 26:02.979
My children are missing.

26:02.979 --> 26:07.192
Yes, but the literary history
of the family and everything suggests--

26:07.192 --> 26:11.112
- Well, let's hope so.
- l've forgotten how to fly.

26:11.196 --> 26:13.198
Yes, well, one does.

26:14.282 --> 26:16.201
Good night, then, ma'am, sir.

26:19.204 --> 26:21.706
No more happy thoughts.

26:23.208 --> 26:24.709
Lost.

26:38.807 --> 26:41.393
Nothing we can do.
The police will do everything--

26:41.518 --> 26:44.020
The police can do nothing.

26:44.104 --> 26:47.107
Oh, really? Maybe we should
call the American police.

26:47.190 --> 26:51.194
ln a crisis, we English always
make a cup of tea. Moira, would you?

26:51.194 --> 26:52.904
- Tea?
- Of course, Gran.

26:52.988 --> 26:55.990
Don't forget to warm the pot.

26:56.116 --> 26:57.993
- l'll go. Moira--
- Peter.

26:58.118 --> 26:59.994
You stay.

27:01.079 --> 27:04.082
Don't worry, Granny Wendy.
l wasn't going to leave.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.794
Hand me my book, please.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.010
lt's time to tell you at last.

27:17.595 --> 27:19.597
Tell me what?

27:20.307 --> 27:25.395
How far back
can you remember, Peter?

27:25.395 --> 27:28.815
l remember the hospital
on Great Ormond Street.

27:28.898 --> 27:30.817
You worked with orphans,
you taught me to read.

27:30.900 --> 27:34.404
You arranged for the adoption by my
American parents, Hank and Jane Banning.

27:34.404 --> 27:37.407
You were 12-- nearly 13.

27:37.490 --> 27:39.284
l mean before that.

27:39.409 --> 27:41.619
There's nothing before that.

27:42.704 --> 27:44.914
Try, Peter. Do try.

27:47.417 --> 27:48.793
Nothing.

27:53.089 --> 27:56.301
You know, when l was young...

27:58.386 --> 28:01.389
no other girl held your favor
the way l did.

28:03.892 --> 28:07.187
l half expected you to alight
on the church and forbid my vows...

28:07.187 --> 28:09.189
on my wedding day.

28:10.315 --> 28:12.692
l wore a pink satin sash.

28:15.904 --> 28:17.906
But you didn't come.

28:19.407 --> 28:20.784
Grandma--

28:21.910 --> 28:26.081
Yes, l was an old lady
when l wrapped you in blankets...

28:26.081 --> 28:27.999
a grandmother...

28:28.083 --> 28:29.084
with my 13-year-old granddaughter
asleep in the bed-- Moira.

28:29.084 --> 28:33.213
with my 13-year-old granddaughter
asleep in the bed-- Moira.

28:33.213 --> 28:35.090
And when you saw her...

28:36.216 --> 28:39.719
that was when you decided
not to go back to Neverland.

28:41.805 --> 28:42.806
Where?

28:43.890 --> 28:46.101
To Never-Neverland.

28:47.310 --> 28:48.812
Moira! l'm getting Moira.

28:48.895 --> 28:52.190
- l've tried to tell you so many times--
- Maybe the tea's ready.

28:52.315 --> 28:55.819
- l knew you'd forgotten.
- l'm not ready to deal with this now.

28:55.902 --> 29:00.115
The stories are true,
l swear to you.

29:00.115 --> 29:02.993
l swear on everything l adore.

29:03.118 --> 29:06.287
And now he's come back
to seek his revenge.

29:06.413 --> 29:08.999
The fight isn't over
for Captain James Hook.

29:08.999 --> 29:12.085
He wants you back. He knows
you'll follow Maggie and Jack...

29:12.085 --> 29:12.919
to the ends of the earth and beyond,
and by heaven you must find a way.

29:12.919 --> 29:18.508
to the ends of the earth and beyond,
and by heaven you must find a way.

29:18.508 --> 29:21.511
Only you can save your children.

29:23.304 --> 29:26.099
Somehow you must go back.

29:27.183 --> 29:30.020
You must make yourself remember.

29:32.313 --> 29:34.107
Remember what?

29:36.401 --> 29:39.487
Peter, don't you know who you are?

30:01.217 --> 30:02.594
Yes, boy.

30:20.695 --> 30:22.113
Sorry.

30:31.206 --> 30:32.582
Parachute.

31:19.879 --> 31:22.716
Firefly from hell!

31:24.509 --> 31:26.219
Big damn bug!

31:38.982 --> 31:41.693
Oh, it is you, it is!
A big you.

31:41.818 --> 31:44.404
l guess it's not bad that you're big.
You were always bigger than me.

31:44.487 --> 31:46.781
But now maybe this means
you'll be twice as much fun.

31:48.616 --> 31:50.410
What fun we'll have again!
What times!

31:50.493 --> 31:51.911
What great games!

31:56.082 --> 31:57.917
You're a little f--

31:59.586 --> 32:01.087
Fairy.

32:05.216 --> 32:06.301
Pixie.

32:06.301 --> 32:09.095
And if less is more,
there's no end to me, Peter Pan.

32:09.179 --> 32:11.598
- Peter Banning.
- Pan.

32:11.598 --> 32:13.808
Whoever you are,
it's still you.

32:13.892 --> 32:16.603
'Cause only one person
has that smell.

32:16.686 --> 32:17.979
Smell?

32:18.104 --> 32:20.690
The smell of someone who's ridden
the back of the wind, Peter.

32:20.815 --> 32:23.318
The smell of a hundred fun summers
of sleeping in trees...

32:23.401 --> 32:25.487
adventures with lndians and pirates.

32:25.612 --> 32:29.282
Oh, remember, Peter? The world was ours.
We could do everything or nothing.

32:29.282 --> 32:32.285
All l had to be was anything,
'cause it was always us.

32:34.120 --> 32:34.496
Oh, no. lt's finally happened.
l'm having a total nervous breakdown.

32:34.496 --> 32:38.583
Oh, no. lt's finally happened.
l'm having a total nervous breakdown.

32:38.583 --> 32:40.418
Peter, follow me
and all will be well.

32:40.418 --> 32:43.505
Or l'm dying.
l'm heading towards the white light.

32:43.588 --> 32:46.383
l've left my body.
See, there's my house way down there.

32:46.508 --> 32:48.802
There are my feet.
Oh, my God. Where are we going?

32:48.885 --> 32:51.513
- To save your children, of course.
- How do you know about my kids?

32:51.596 --> 32:54.599
Everybody knows. Captain Hook's
got them and you've got to fight him.

32:54.682 --> 32:56.101
Let's fly!

33:02.816 --> 33:05.610
lt is true, then.
You did grow up.

33:08.279 --> 33:11.700
l drank poison for you.
You used to call me Tink.

33:11.700 --> 33:14.786
- Have you forgotten everything?
- Are you in there, little bug?

33:14.786 --> 33:17.414
l'm not a bug.
l'm a fairy.

33:21.918 --> 33:24.087
l do not believe in fairies.

33:24.212 --> 33:26.715
Every time someone says,
''l do not believe in fairies''...

33:26.798 --> 33:29.509
somewhere there's a fairy
that falls down dead.

33:29.592 --> 33:31.511
l do not believe in fairies!

33:42.981 --> 33:45.191
Oh, my God,
l think l killed it.

33:46.609 --> 33:49.279
Are you alive, little bug?
Look out!

33:49.404 --> 33:52.407
Clap your hands, Peter.

33:52.407 --> 33:54.409
lt's the only way to save me.

33:57.120 --> 33:58.580
Louder.

33:59.497 --> 34:01.499
Louder, Peter!

34:02.917 --> 34:04.419
Okay, l'm clapping!

34:06.504 --> 34:08.715
Oh, God, you're alive.

34:08.715 --> 34:11.217
All right, now.
Who am l?

34:13.219 --> 34:14.596
You're, um--

34:18.683 --> 34:21.811
You're a Freudian hallucination
having something to do with my mother...

34:21.895 --> 34:24.188
and l don't know why you have wings,
but you have very lovely legs...

34:24.313 --> 34:26.608
and you're a very nice tiny person,
and what am l saying?

34:26.690 --> 34:29.194
l don't know who my mother was, l'm
an orphan, and l've never taken drugs...

34:29.319 --> 34:31.196
because l missed the '60s,
l was an accountant.

34:31.987 --> 34:33.406
Guess again.

34:35.492 --> 34:37.994
Oh, look. Stars.

34:37.994 --> 34:41.498
That's right, Peter. Second star to
the right and straight on till morning.

34:43.708 --> 34:45.502
Neverland.

35:46.688 --> 35:49.816
What a nightmare. Moira!

36:03.496 --> 36:05.707
Hear ye, hear ye!

36:05.790 --> 36:08.501
Roll out. Roll out!

36:14.382 --> 36:17.302
Neverbirds!
Three for a farthing.

36:17.385 --> 36:19.804
Pies for sale.

36:19.888 --> 36:21.806
Lovely fish !

36:21.890 --> 36:23.516
Fresh fish!

36:23.600 --> 36:27.103
We keep the eyes in
so they'll see you through the week.

36:32.192 --> 36:35.612
Excuse me.
ls there a pay phone around here?

36:35.695 --> 36:37.989
- That is so real.
- Peter, get back here!

36:37.989 --> 36:39.616
Get down, get low.

36:39.699 --> 36:41.117
Hide!

36:42.994 --> 36:46.206
Hello.
lf it ain't the Mother lnferior.

36:46.289 --> 36:48.208
Gentlemen,
l'm looking for someone.

36:48.291 --> 36:51.711
l fancy them shiny shoes
for my booty.

36:51.795 --> 36:53.380
You can get them at Armani.

36:54.714 --> 36:58.009
Tink, help me!

36:58.093 --> 37:00.595
Tinkerball-- Tinkerbun--

37:00.720 --> 37:02.514
Don't get no blood on them boots!

37:02.597 --> 37:04.307
They's mine!

37:04.391 --> 37:06.184
Help me, Tinkerbell!

37:06.893 --> 37:08.895
You pixie devil!

37:12.899 --> 37:15.485
Oh, please don't.
l have a bad back.

37:16.820 --> 37:18.697
Ya pixie devil !

37:26.788 --> 37:28.707
Are you related to Mighty Mouse?

37:34.087 --> 37:36.715
lf you insist on seeing Hook
and desire to be alive when you do so...

37:36.798 --> 37:38.383
do exactly what l say.

37:38.508 --> 37:41.719
Your left arm is dead,
it hangs lifeless at your side.

37:41.803 --> 37:45.390
Lean on the crutch!
Left foot turned in.

37:45.515 --> 37:48.602
Tilt your head and glare
with your good eye.

37:48.685 --> 37:51.187
Now crack your mouth and drool.

37:51.312 --> 37:53.606
Now growl. Growl !

37:53.690 --> 37:55.191
- How are you?
- Not bad, and you?

37:55.316 --> 37:57.110
- Not bad!
- All right!

38:17.297 --> 38:20.592
Put your faces on, girls.
Here comes Smee!

38:25.597 --> 38:27.098
Follow that hook!

38:27.182 --> 38:29.517
Make way for the hook!

38:31.519 --> 38:33.813
He's gonna love this hook!

38:41.696 --> 38:43.615
Hook, show us the hook

38:43.698 --> 38:45.617
Hook, give us the hook

39:16.606 --> 39:19.984
Good morning, Neverland!

39:19.984 --> 39:23.196
Good morning, Mr. Smee!

39:23.196 --> 39:26.407
- Tie down the main mast, mateys...
- Aye!

39:26.407 --> 39:29.202
'cause here he is--
the cunning king fish...

39:29.285 --> 39:31.079
the bad barracuda...

39:31.204 --> 39:31.788
a man so deep,
he's almost unfathomable.

39:31.788 --> 39:38.002
a man so deep,
he's almost unfathomable.

39:38.002 --> 39:41.715
A man so quick,
he's even fast asleep.

39:42.799 --> 39:44.301
Thank you.

39:44.301 --> 39:48.012
Now, let's give him a very big hand,
'cause he's only got one.

39:50.390 --> 39:54.185
l give you
the steel-handed stingray...

39:54.185 --> 39:56.688
Captain James Hook!

40:08.408 --> 40:10.493
See how greatly
the men favor you, sir?

40:10.618 --> 40:14.289
The pewling spawn--
how l despise them.

40:14.414 --> 40:15.790
Go get 'em, Captain !

40:20.211 --> 40:21.713
Thank you, thank you.

40:23.590 --> 40:24.090
Well, my stupid, sorry,
parasitic sacks of entrails...

40:24.090 --> 40:31.389
Well, my stupid, sorry,
parasitic sacks of entrails...

40:31.389 --> 40:33.308
revenge is mine.

40:34.893 --> 40:36.394
Long live the hook!

40:36.519 --> 40:39.814
l baited that hook,
and now l'm very proud to announce...

40:39.898 --> 40:41.816
we have his children.

40:41.900 --> 40:45.487
Oh, my God.
Jack and Maggie.

40:45.487 --> 40:47.489
Long live Hook

40:47.489 --> 40:50.200
Finally l'm going
to kill Peter Pan...

40:50.200 --> 40:54.120
that cocky boy who cut off my hand
and fed it to the crocodile!

40:55.205 --> 40:57.415
And who killed
that cunning crocodile?

40:57.499 --> 40:59.000
Who stuffed him?

40:59.000 --> 41:01.002
Who made him into a quiet clock?

41:01.002 --> 41:04.089
Who went into the other world
and stole Pan's children?

41:04.089 --> 41:06.508
And who didn't believe
l could do it?

41:07.592 --> 41:10.220
Who doubted me?

41:10.303 --> 41:13.181
Who amongst us does not belong?

41:13.306 --> 41:16.017
Someone here does not belong,
a stranger amongst the loyal.

41:16.101 --> 41:18.186
l will weed you out.

41:20.980 --> 41:22.399
You!

41:32.200 --> 41:33.993
Where's the carpet, Smee?

41:34.119 --> 41:35.787
Oh, sorry, sir.

41:38.415 --> 41:40.000
You.

41:40.083 --> 41:41.918
That's right, you.

41:42.001 --> 41:44.504
No, not you. Not you.

41:45.505 --> 41:46.506
You.

41:51.594 --> 41:54.389
You bet against me
bringing Pan back here, didn't you?

41:54.389 --> 41:55.390
No.

41:57.183 --> 41:59.102
Tell your captain the truth.

42:02.689 --> 42:05.483
Oh, say it.

42:06.609 --> 42:08.903
- l did.
- Yes, you made a boo-boo.

42:09.988 --> 42:11.698
The Boo Box.

42:11.781 --> 42:14.617
Not that!
Not the Boo Box!

42:15.618 --> 42:16.494
Good.

42:29.716 --> 42:31.718
You cannot lie to the captain!

42:31.801 --> 42:33.011
Boo!

42:35.680 --> 42:38.683
- Long live Hook
- Put me down !

42:38.808 --> 42:42.312
l want my mommy!
l want my daddy!

42:43.396 --> 42:45.398
Hello, children.

42:45.482 --> 42:47.901
Comfy? Cozy?

42:47.984 --> 42:50.904
Those are my kids!

42:55.492 --> 42:58.203
Are you okay?
Everything's going to be all right.

42:58.286 --> 43:00.789
Get out of the way!

43:00.914 --> 43:02.999
Daddy's here.

43:02.999 --> 43:07.087
Hook, l want those kids, or you better
get an attorney that's better than me.

43:07.087 --> 43:09.798
- Who are you?
- Peter Banning, attorney at law.

43:09.798 --> 43:11.883
- Those are my children.
- Those are your--

43:12.008 --> 43:13.593
- Children.
- These are your children?

43:13.718 --> 43:14.803
- Yes, they are.
- And you're--

43:14.886 --> 43:16.805
- Peter.
- You're Peter?

43:21.184 --> 43:24.604
- ls there an echo in here?
- My great and worthy opponent?

43:24.687 --> 43:27.190
- Yes.
- No! Smee!

43:27.315 --> 43:28.900
Who is this impostor?

43:28.983 --> 43:31.695
Peter-floggin'-flyin'-Pan !

43:31.695 --> 43:34.281
No, l'm not Peter Pan.

43:34.281 --> 43:36.282
l am just an ordinary--

43:36.407 --> 43:38.702
l've got a sworn affidavit
by a T-Bell.

43:38.785 --> 43:42.580
l've got his medical history,
l've even got his dental records.

43:42.580 --> 43:44.791
- Excuse me.
- You tryin' to do me out of a job?

43:44.916 --> 43:47.210
- What's the matter with you?
- May l show you something?

43:47.293 --> 43:49.713
- Will you let go of me?
- Release him.

43:49.796 --> 43:52.007
- May l show you this?
- Will you shut him up?

43:52.007 --> 43:54.509
Oh, flog off.
Just shut up.

43:56.302 --> 43:59.681
- Captain, put these on.
- l want to see the scar.

43:59.806 --> 44:01.391
The hypertrophy.

44:01.516 --> 44:05.312
Here's the scar where you sliced him
during the Tiger Lily incident.

44:05.395 --> 44:08.398
- That's my appendix.
- What's this?

44:08.398 --> 44:08.690
Fairy footprints. He's Peter Pan
or l've got a dead man's dinghy.

44:08.690 --> 44:16.406
Fairy footprints. He's Peter Pan
or l've got a dead man's dinghy.

44:16.406 --> 44:18.700
ls it you?

44:18.700 --> 44:21.411
My great and worthy opponent?

44:22.579 --> 44:24.581
But it can't be.

44:25.707 --> 44:27.208
Not this pitiful, spineless, pasty,
bloated codfish l see before me.

44:27.208 --> 44:32.297
Not this pitiful, spineless, pasty,
bloated codfish l see before me.

44:32.297 --> 44:34.591
You're not even
a shadow of Peter Pan.

44:38.595 --> 44:42.015
l think we have an obligation
to clarify this Pan problem...

44:42.098 --> 44:43.892
- This disaster.
- which must be remedied.

44:44.017 --> 44:46.311
- Expediently, l agree.
- l want my children.

44:46.394 --> 44:49.481
- For me the stakes can be no higher.
- For me they can have sunk no lower.

44:49.606 --> 44:51.983
l want my war!

44:52.108 --> 44:53.902
Blow him out of the water, Dad!

44:53.902 --> 44:56.488
Daddy's handling this.
lt's okay.

44:56.613 --> 44:59.282
Oh, come on, Peter.
Pick up your weapon.

45:00.408 --> 45:01.910
All right.

45:04.287 --> 45:05.705
How much?

45:14.714 --> 45:17.384
Hoist and raise the kiddies!

45:17.509 --> 45:19.385
Dad, help!

45:24.599 --> 45:27.102
l'll make you a deal,
Mr. Chairman of the Board.

45:27.185 --> 45:29.896
Fly up there and touch
the outstretched fingers...

45:29.979 --> 45:32.482
of your frightened children,
and l'll set them free.

45:32.607 --> 45:33.983
l can't fly.

45:34.109 --> 45:37.696
Explode out of there!
Stop the charade! Free your children!

45:37.779 --> 45:39.697
- Dad, help!
- Daddy!

45:41.991 --> 45:45.286
- l beg your pardon?
- l have a real problem with heights.

45:45.412 --> 45:47.289
You must be joking.

45:48.999 --> 45:52.293
Peter Pan has a real problem
with heights.

45:53.420 --> 45:55.880
- l'm not Peter Pan.
- Dad, help!

45:56.006 --> 45:58.300
lt's okay.
Hang on, son.

45:58.383 --> 46:01.010
l'm coming, sweetheart.
Someone give me a hand.

46:01.094 --> 46:03.012
l already have.

46:06.599 --> 46:08.518
Help us, Daddy!

46:12.480 --> 46:14.315
- Come on !
- Save us, Daddy!

46:14.399 --> 46:16.401
Save me, Daddy!

46:17.902 --> 46:21.614
You know who you are.
What new game is this, Peter? Fly!

46:21.698 --> 46:23.908
Stop pretending!

46:26.494 --> 46:28.997
Fly! l know it's you!

46:34.002 --> 46:37.714
Be the Pan you are.
Fly.

46:37.714 --> 46:39.716
Fly. Think a happy thought.

46:39.716 --> 46:40.008
All you have to do is touch our fingers
and we'll be able to go home.

46:40.008 --> 46:44.095
All you have to do is touch our fingers
and we'll be able to go home.

46:44.095 --> 46:48.308
Touch them, Peter,
and it's all been just a bad dream.

46:48.308 --> 46:50.894
Just reach out and touch them.

46:53.313 --> 46:55.482
Flap your arms and fly!

46:57.692 --> 46:59.486
Reach !

46:59.486 --> 47:01.905
Come on, Daddy.
Mommy could do it.

47:06.284 --> 47:06.618
Smee, l don't understand.
Why doesn't he fly? ls he not Peter Pan?

47:06.618 --> 47:10.705
Smee, l don't understand.
Why doesn't he fly? ls he not Peter Pan?

47:10.705 --> 47:13.583
He's Peter Pan,
all right, Captain.

47:13.583 --> 47:14.083
He's just been away from Neverland for
so long, his mind's been ''junk-tified.''

47:14.083 --> 47:18.213
He's just been away from Neverland for
so long, his mind's been ''junk-tified.''

47:18.213 --> 47:20.382
He's forgotten everything.

47:26.179 --> 47:28.515
Please don't give up.

47:39.192 --> 47:40.485
Dad.

47:41.486 --> 47:43.405
l wanna go home.

47:46.699 --> 47:49.285
Gentlemen,
l'm afraid l have decided...

47:49.411 --> 47:51.413
to cancel the war.

47:52.414 --> 47:55.416
He can't fly,
but he can swim!

47:55.500 --> 47:57.293
Kill them.

47:57.293 --> 47:59.295
Kill them all.

47:59.295 --> 48:02.215
- Dad!
- Bring on the plank!

48:05.010 --> 48:11.808
And l never want to hear
the name ''Peter Pan'' again!

48:11.808 --> 48:14.394
What about the name ''Hook''?
ls that how you want to be remembered?

48:14.519 --> 48:20.692
As a bully? Or as the great warrior
who defeated a heroic Pan?

48:20.692 --> 48:26.197
One week and l'll get him in shape,
and you can have your dirty old war.

48:26.197 --> 48:26.614
lt's a trick, Captain. Let me blast
that buzzing vixen to pixie hell.

48:26.614 --> 48:30.702
lt's a trick, Captain. Let me blast
that buzzing vixen to pixie hell.

48:30.702 --> 48:32.203
Smee.

48:33.913 --> 48:36.416
You promised people
the war of the century.

48:36.499 --> 48:38.918
Your whole life has been
building to this moment.

48:38.918 --> 48:41.713
Mortal combat, glory,
Hook versus Pan!

48:41.713 --> 48:43.715
That is not Pan.

48:57.479 --> 48:58.980
Two days.

48:59.105 --> 49:01.983
Four--
bare minimum for a decent Pan.

49:02.108 --> 49:03.902
Three. Final offer.

49:03.902 --> 49:05.612
Done.

49:07.697 --> 49:09.783
And you better deliver,
Miss Bell...

49:09.783 --> 49:13.703
or no amount of clapping will bring you
back from where l will send you.

49:16.498 --> 49:19.292
Hear me, men.
For reasons of good form...

49:19.417 --> 49:22.587
l've decided that the so-called Pan
will return in three days...

49:22.712 --> 49:24.881
to commence the arbitrament
of the sword.

49:24.881 --> 49:26.383
Smee, translate.

49:26.508 --> 49:28.385
ln three days
we're gonna have a war...

49:28.385 --> 49:30.887
a battle between good and evil,
to the death.

49:37.894 --> 49:39.395
Help me.

51:22.582 --> 51:24.083
Snow!

51:27.879 --> 51:30.006
Hot.

51:30.006 --> 51:31.508
What?

51:43.812 --> 51:45.814
Help!

51:49.317 --> 51:51.403
Get me down !

51:56.116 --> 51:57.909
Oh, you're alive!

51:57.992 --> 52:01.079
Oh, get me down!
l believe!

52:01.204 --> 52:03.498
Lost Boys, Lost Boys,
wake up!

52:10.588 --> 52:12.090
Pan's back!

52:12.215 --> 52:14.718
Lost Boys, wake up!

52:15.885 --> 52:18.179
That was my pillow!

52:18.304 --> 52:20.598
Sure, yeah, l'm up.

52:22.809 --> 52:25.604
Wake up, you sleepyheads!

52:25.604 --> 52:27.981
Pan's back!

52:44.998 --> 52:46.916
Who's the shrub?

52:48.793 --> 52:50.879
Bangerang!

52:59.012 --> 53:00.680
That ain't Peter Pan.

53:00.805 --> 53:03.016
- He's old.
- He's fat.

53:03.016 --> 53:05.018
Not so fat to me.

53:05.101 --> 53:08.480
He's an old, fat grandpa man.

53:13.985 --> 53:15.403
Rufio!

53:23.119 --> 53:25.789
Oh, that is so dangerous.

53:30.085 --> 53:32.003
That's enough!

53:33.380 --> 53:35.882
Okay, mister. All right.
The show's over now.

53:36.007 --> 53:36.508
You put that thing away, put it down
before you poke somebody's eye out.

53:36.508 --> 53:40.595
You put that thing away, put it down
before you poke somebody's eye out.

53:40.595 --> 53:43.014
You're not old enough to shave.
What are you doing with a sword?

53:43.098 --> 53:45.892
Flying around--
This is an insurance nightmare!

53:46.017 --> 53:48.395
What is this,
some Lord of the Flies preschool?

53:48.395 --> 53:50.897
Where are your parents?

53:50.897 --> 53:52.816
Who's in charge here?

53:55.318 --> 53:57.904
No, Mr. Skunkhead
with too much mousse.

53:57.988 --> 53:59.781
You are just a punk kid.

53:59.906 --> 54:02.117
l want to speak to a grown-up.

54:02.200 --> 54:05.120
- All grown-ups are pirates.
- Excuse me?

54:05.203 --> 54:07.497
We kill pirates.

54:08.790 --> 54:10.792
l'm not a pirate.

54:10.917 --> 54:13.420
lt so happens l am a lawyer.

54:14.379 --> 54:16.089
Kill the lawyer!

54:17.215 --> 54:19.092
l'm not that kind of lawyer.

54:42.407 --> 54:43.783
l've been shot!

54:48.788 --> 54:51.416
Help! Help me, somebody!

54:57.213 --> 54:59.716
Boys, listen!
He married Wendy's granddaughter!

54:59.799 --> 55:02.594
Hook has kidnapped his kids.
He's just out of shape.

55:02.719 --> 55:04.888
We have to make him bangerang.

55:07.599 --> 55:10.393
Why are you doing this to me?

55:10.518 --> 55:12.812
Rufio, you're the best with a sword.

55:12.896 --> 55:15.815
Please teach him.
We gotta make him remember.

55:29.496 --> 55:30.789
Excuse me.

55:45.303 --> 55:46.679
- Help me!
- Help me!

55:46.805 --> 55:48.598
- Not you.
- Not you?

56:05.698 --> 56:07.117
Helmets!

56:14.207 --> 56:15.583
Oh, my. A wall.

56:23.091 --> 56:24.718
Stop it!

56:26.719 --> 56:29.389
Lost Boys, stop it!

56:36.187 --> 56:38.481
Play!

57:04.090 --> 57:07.510
You're dead, jolly man.

57:07.594 --> 57:11.890
He can't do those things.
He can't even play simple games.

57:11.890 --> 57:14.809
Hook has got his kids,
and l've got three days...

57:14.893 --> 57:18.396
to get him ready to fight,
and l need everybody's help.

57:18.480 --> 57:21.900
Peter Pan's gots kids?

57:29.407 --> 57:33.620
You can't fly, fight, or crow.

57:33.620 --> 57:35.497
So...

57:35.580 --> 57:36.998
if any of you says this here scug
ain't Peter Pan, cross the line.

57:36.998 --> 57:47.008
if any of you says this here scug
ain't Peter Pan, cross the line.

57:47.008 --> 57:48.385
Hi.

57:48.510 --> 57:50.720
What? Be right back.

57:52.013 --> 57:55.100
- What?
- You are embarrassing me!

59:09.299 --> 59:11.801
Oh, there you are, Peter.

59:31.112 --> 59:32.405
But, Peter, you've grown up.
You promised never to grow old.

59:32.405 --> 59:41.206
But, Peter, you've grown up.
You promised never to grow old.

59:41.206 --> 59:43.416
His nose got real big.

59:43.416 --> 59:47.003
Well, welcome back to Neverland,
Pan the Man.

59:47.087 --> 59:50.715
Don't listen to that stinkin' fairy
and that brainless fungus!

59:50.799 --> 59:53.510
l got Pan's sword.
l'm the Pan now.

59:53.510 --> 59:59.391
You think this guy's
gonna take it from me, Rufio?

59:59.391 --> 01:00:03.103
Wait! lf Tink believes,
maybe he is.

01:00:08.817 --> 01:00:11.194
Are you gonna follow
this drooler...

01:00:11.319 --> 01:00:13.989
against Capitán Hook?

01:00:14.114 --> 01:00:17.409
What's he doin' here
if he's not Peter Pan, huh?

01:00:17.492 --> 01:00:21.287
He don't look happy here.
And who are them kids Hook's got?

01:00:21.287 --> 01:00:23.915
- Give him a chance!
- Those are my kids.

01:00:23.999 --> 01:00:27.001
And Hook is gonna kill them
unless we do something.

01:00:28.211 --> 01:00:31.297
Help me. Please?

01:00:31.381 --> 01:00:34.217
Come on! Give him a chance!

01:00:40.682 --> 01:00:43.184
l should claw myself
with my own hook, Smee.

01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:47.188
Not to kill Pan
when l had the chance.

01:00:47.188 --> 01:00:51.109
What have l done?
What have l done, Smee?

01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:54.779
Agreed to a preposterous plan?
An absurd war?

01:00:54.779 --> 01:00:58.491
Now l'm bound by
my indefatigable good form to wait.

01:00:58.616 --> 01:01:01.494
- l'll fix you a nice plate.
- Wait for what?

01:01:01.619 --> 01:01:02.996
Whether it be three days or decades,
he will always be a fat old Pan.

01:01:02.996 --> 01:01:07.083
Whether it be three days or decades,
he will always be a fat old Pan.

01:01:07.083 --> 01:01:09.794
Oh, l hate being
disappointed, Smee...

01:01:09.919 --> 01:01:12.297
and l hate living
in this flawed body...

01:01:12.297 --> 01:01:14.716
and l hate living in Neverland...

01:01:14.799 --> 01:01:17.302
and l hate, l hate...

01:01:17.385 --> 01:01:17.719
l hate Peter Pan!

01:01:17.719 --> 01:01:29.481
l hate Peter Pan!

01:01:29.481 --> 01:01:32.192
Smee, l've just had
a sublime vision.

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:39.908
All the jagged parts of my life
have come together...

01:01:39.991 --> 01:01:43.912
to form a complete
and mystical whole.

01:01:46.206 --> 01:01:47.707
An epiphany.

01:01:47.791 --> 01:01:49.918
A piffy what?

01:01:51.002 --> 01:01:54.506
- My life is over.
- You mean you've lost your appetite?

01:01:54.506 --> 01:01:57.509
Yes. Good-bye.

01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:01.596
Where are you going?
Are you getting dramatic?

01:02:01.679 --> 01:02:03.181
Good-bye, Smee.

01:02:03.306 --> 01:02:06.101
Captain, why don't we play
with your island, eh?

01:02:06.101 --> 01:02:06.393
You know, all the little injuns
and soldiers and all the Lost Boys?

01:02:06.393 --> 01:02:14.317
You know, all the little injuns
and soldiers and all the Lost Boys?

01:02:14.317 --> 01:02:15.110
No stopping me this time, Smee.
This is it.

01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:19.197
No stopping me this time, Smee.
This is it.

01:02:19.197 --> 01:02:22.617
Don't make a move, Smee.
Not a step.

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:25.203
My finger's on the trigger.

01:02:25.203 --> 01:02:28.290
- Don't try to stop me.
- On, not again.

01:02:28.415 --> 01:02:32.585
This is it.
Don't try to stop me this time, Smee.

01:02:32.585 --> 01:02:34.713
Don't try to stop me
this time, Smee.

01:02:34.796 --> 01:02:35.088
Don't you dare try to stop me this time.
Try to stop me.

01:02:35.088 --> 01:02:40.510
Don't you dare try to stop me this time.
Try to stop me.

01:02:40.510 --> 01:02:43.513
You'd better get up off your ass.
Get over here, Smee!

01:02:43.596 --> 01:02:45.098
- l'm comin'!
- Stop me!

01:02:45.098 --> 01:02:48.685
This is not a joke!
l'm committing suicide!

01:02:53.314 --> 01:02:55.692
-Don't ever frighten me like that again.
-l'm sorry.

01:02:55.817 --> 01:02:59.696
- Are you some kind of sadist?
- l'm sorry. How do you feel now?

01:02:59.779 --> 01:03:02.490
- l want to die.
- Oh, now, now.

01:03:02.615 --> 01:03:05.410
- There's no adventure here.
- You call this no adventure?

01:03:05.410 --> 01:03:07.996
Death is the only
great adventure l have left.

01:03:07.996 --> 01:03:11.416
- Let's get you into bed.
- lt's all over.

01:03:11.416 --> 01:03:13.918
- Don't upset yourself.
- l want to go beddy-bye.

01:03:13.918 --> 01:03:16.379
- You're still you, l'm still me.
- My career is over.

01:03:16.379 --> 01:03:20.592
- There's wars you haven't thought of.
- This war was supposed to end all wars.

01:03:20.592 --> 01:03:23.720
- And it will.
- The ultimate war.

01:03:23.803 --> 01:03:26.306
Rock-a-bye Captain
in the crow's nest

01:03:26.389 --> 01:03:29.893
There must be a way to get at him, Smee,
to get even with him...

01:03:30.018 --> 01:03:32.687
to get him where
it really would hurt.

01:03:32.812 --> 01:03:34.898
There must be something
l haven't thought of.

01:03:34.898 --> 01:03:37.192
Where is he vulnerable?

01:03:37.317 --> 01:03:41.112
Don't let's have any more of this talk
about doin' away with yourself.

01:03:41.196 --> 01:03:45.200
l mean, what would the world be like
without Captain Hook?

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:47.786
lndeed. Good form, Smee.

01:03:47.786 --> 01:03:50.705
What would the world be like
without Captain Hook?

01:03:50.705 --> 01:03:54.501
- There you go.
- l'm ready for my nightcap.

01:03:54.501 --> 01:03:57.295
Abso-floggin'-lutely.

01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:00.006
l think a bit of skulduggery
would do you good.

01:04:00.090 --> 01:04:03.093
Take your mind off
this Pan business.

01:04:03.093 --> 01:04:07.389
First thing tomorrow morning, we'll
shoot some lndians out of Long Tom.

01:04:07.389 --> 01:04:11.518
l'm tired of killing lndians and Lost
Boys. l've killed them most of my life.

01:04:11.518 --> 01:04:14.187
l want to kill Peter Pan.
l want to kill him!

01:04:14.312 --> 01:04:17.107
Give me the power to kill him.

01:04:17.107 --> 01:04:18.692
Oh, dear.

01:04:27.992 --> 01:04:29.619
l've just had an apostrophe.

01:04:29.703 --> 01:04:31.913
l think you mean an epiphany.

01:04:31.997 --> 01:04:35.416
Lightning has just struck my brain.

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:37.419
Well, that must hurt.

01:04:37.502 --> 01:04:40.714
- Pan's kids.
- What about them?

01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:48.596
- You could make 'em like you.
- Say what?

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:59.190
- We could make the buggers love you.
- No, Smee.

01:05:00.108 --> 01:05:02.902
No little children love me.

01:05:02.986 --> 01:05:06.614
- Captain, that is the point.
- What do you mean?

01:05:06.698 --> 01:05:09.701
That is the ultimate revenge.

01:05:09.784 --> 01:05:12.787
- What is?
- Pan's kids in love with Hook.

01:05:12.912 --> 01:05:15.790
- What are you getting on about?
- lt's the ultimate payback.

01:05:15.916 --> 01:05:18.084
- What is?
- lmagine Pan's puss...

01:05:18.209 --> 01:05:20.503
- Yes?
- when he faces you...

01:05:20.587 --> 01:05:23.506
and his kids
standin' beside you...

01:05:23.506 --> 01:05:24.382
ready to fight for the sleaziest sleaze
of the Seven Seas, Captain James Hook.

01:05:24.382 --> 01:05:28.511
ready to fight for the sleaziest sleaze
of the Seven Seas, Captain James Hook.

01:05:28.511 --> 01:05:30.889
- Captain, it's beautiful.
- Yes, l see.

01:05:31.014 --> 01:05:32.891
Don't worry about that, Captain.
Thank you.

01:05:33.016 --> 01:05:35.685
You know, Smee, l like it!

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:41.483
Oh, Smee, what a superb idea
l've just had!

01:05:41.608 --> 01:05:45.195
Tomorrow l'll make
Pan's brats love me.

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:48.490
Oh, Peter Pan will fly again.
He'll remember how.

01:05:48.615 --> 01:05:52.410
And if he doesn't, those dirty
Lost Boys will jog his memory.

01:05:52.494 --> 01:05:53.912
Yes, you'll see.

01:05:53.995 --> 01:05:57.082
He'll crow, he'll fight,
he'll fly...

01:05:57.207 --> 01:05:59.501
and then, he'll die.

01:06:09.594 --> 01:06:12.806
Pick 'em up
Move 'em down

01:06:12.889 --> 01:06:16.184
Pick 'em on up
Move 'em on down

01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:19.604
Ain't no time to celebrate

01:06:19.604 --> 01:06:22.899
You are old and overweight

01:06:22.982 --> 01:06:26.194
Gotta lose a million pounds

01:06:26.194 --> 01:06:28.989
- Get your fat butt off the ground
- Reach on down and touch your toes

01:06:29.114 --> 01:06:31.199
Reach on down and touch your toes

01:06:31.199 --> 01:06:34.494
How long since
you looked at those

01:06:34.619 --> 01:06:37.789
Shape up
Lose weight

01:06:37.914 --> 01:06:40.291
Get thin
Gotta win

01:06:40.416 --> 01:06:43.712
- Jumpin' jacks are good for you
- Now your face is turnin' blue

01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:48.592
Swing your arms around your back

01:06:48.717 --> 01:06:51.094
- Give yourself a heart attack
- Gotta train

01:06:51.094 --> 01:06:53.596
- Gotta train
- ln the rain

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:56.891
ln the sun
ln the snow

01:06:57.017 --> 01:06:59.185
- Ten below
- Gotta move

01:06:59.311 --> 01:07:01.187
Gotta crow

01:07:03.314 --> 01:07:05.316
Go easy on me.
l'm a beginner.

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:06.693
Low! High!

01:07:10.113 --> 01:07:13.408
Fight, Gramps.
Give it your best shot.

01:07:13.491 --> 01:07:16.119
Rufio's only trying to help.
Listen, learn.

01:07:16.119 --> 01:07:18.580
Okay. Ready?
l don't want to hurt you.

01:07:22.709 --> 01:07:25.879
- Watch it. He don't have armor on.
- Be bangerang, old man.

01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:42.479
What are you doing?
How does this help me get my kids back?

01:07:42.479 --> 01:07:44.189
What do l have to do next?

01:07:44.314 --> 01:07:47.817
Next: time to fly.

01:07:54.616 --> 01:07:56.201
Just think happy thoughts.

01:07:56.284 --> 01:07:58.495
Peter, think happy thoughts.

01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:03.708
All you need is one happy thought.
One happy thought will make you fly.

01:08:03.708 --> 01:08:05.794
l got it!

01:08:05.794 --> 01:08:06.211
Not being in this slingshot
would make me very happy!

01:08:06.211 --> 01:08:11.216
Not being in this slingshot
would make me very happy!

01:08:11.216 --> 01:08:13.009
He's goin' up!

01:08:13.093 --> 01:08:15.011
He's comin' down !

01:08:18.598 --> 01:08:22.519
Now pay attention, class.
We have a lot to go over.

01:08:22.602 --> 01:08:23.520
Lesson one:
Why parents hate their children.

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:29.984
Lesson one:
Why parents hate their children.

01:08:29.984 --> 01:08:31.319
Anyone?

01:08:32.112 --> 01:08:34.698
Doesn't Mommy
read to us every night?

01:08:34.781 --> 01:08:35.490
You, the cute little urchin
in the front row.

01:08:35.490 --> 01:08:39.618
You, the cute little urchin
in the front row.

01:08:39.618 --> 01:08:40.287
Won't you share your thoughts
with the whole class?

01:08:40.287 --> 01:08:44.416
Won't you share your thoughts
with the whole class?

01:08:44.416 --> 01:08:47.417
l said Mommy
reads to us every night...

01:08:47.502 --> 01:08:50.296
because she loves us very much.

01:08:50.296 --> 01:08:52.799
Loves you?
lsn't that the--

01:08:52.881 --> 01:08:54.801
The ''L'' word, Captain.

01:08:54.884 --> 01:08:56.886
Oh, yes.
No, child.

01:08:57.011 --> 01:08:59.014
l think your mother
reads to you every night...

01:08:59.096 --> 01:09:02.100
in order to stupefy you to sleep.

01:09:02.184 --> 01:09:06.395
So that she and Daddy can sit down
for three measly minutes without you...

01:09:06.395 --> 01:09:08.481
and your mindless,
inexhaustible...

01:09:08.606 --> 01:09:11.818
unstoppable, repetitive
and nagging demands.

01:09:11.901 --> 01:09:15.113
''He took my toy.''
''She hit my bear.''

01:09:15.196 --> 01:09:17.907
''l want to potty.''
''l want a cookie.''

01:09:17.907 --> 01:09:20.201
''l want to stay up.''
''l want, l want.''

01:09:20.201 --> 01:09:21.786
''Me, me, me.''

01:09:21.912 --> 01:09:24.080
''Mine, mine, mine.''

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:26.416
''Now, now, now.''

01:09:27.417 --> 01:09:30.587
Can't you understand, child?

01:09:30.712 --> 01:09:34.883
- They tell you stories to shut you up.
- And conk you out.

01:09:34.883 --> 01:09:38.720
That's not true, Jack.
You're a liar!

01:09:38.803 --> 01:09:40.889
Lie? Me?

01:09:43.308 --> 01:09:44.809
Never.

01:09:45.810 --> 01:09:48.897
The truth is far too much fun.

01:09:51.482 --> 01:09:54.402
Oh, my child,
before you were born...

01:09:54.486 --> 01:09:58.114
your parents would stay up all night
together just to see the sunrise.

01:09:58.114 --> 01:09:59.908
Don't be frightened.

01:09:59.991 --> 01:10:00.617
Maggie, before you were born,
they were happier.

01:10:00.617 --> 01:10:05.914
Maggie, before you were born,
they were happier.

01:10:05.914 --> 01:10:07.707
They were free.

01:10:08.791 --> 01:10:11.419
You're a bad man.

01:10:11.502 --> 01:10:13.713
Flunk the maggot.

01:10:13.713 --> 01:10:15.715
Abso-floggin'-lutely.

01:10:15.715 --> 01:10:18.385
An ''F''?

01:10:20.011 --> 01:10:22.681
- He gave me an ''F''!
- Jack.

01:10:24.516 --> 01:10:27.686
Your father went to your sister's
school play, did he not?

01:10:28.395 --> 01:10:31.606
But did he go
to your baseball game?

01:10:34.484 --> 01:10:35.902
How'd you know about that?

01:10:35.985 --> 01:10:38.488
He missed the most
important game...

01:10:38.613 --> 01:10:39.280
on what might have been the most
important day of your young life.

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:44.911
on what might have been the most
important day of your young life.

01:10:44.911 --> 01:10:47.205
- l wanna tear your hook off!
- Easy.

01:10:47.205 --> 01:10:49.791
l hate you, Mr. Hook!

01:10:49.916 --> 01:10:54.003
What did l tell you, Smee?
No little children love me.

01:10:54.003 --> 01:10:57.799
'Course they do. Come on, you.
You're depressin' the captain.

01:10:57.799 --> 01:11:01.219
Jack, you listen to me.
Never let him make you forget.

01:11:01.302 --> 01:11:04.514
- Never forget Mommy and Daddy!
- Maggie.

01:11:04.514 --> 01:11:06.391
Think of a way to run home!

01:11:06.516 --> 01:11:09.186
- Run home!
- Run home?

01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:15.108
You are home.

01:11:17.694 --> 01:11:18.987
Right?

01:11:34.085 --> 01:11:36.004
Oh, yeah.

01:12:02.614 --> 01:12:05.200
No, no.
We don't use them.

01:12:05.283 --> 01:12:08.495
- Why do you have them?
- So we don't have to use them.

01:12:09.704 --> 01:12:12.207
Don't crowd me!

01:12:12.207 --> 01:12:13.708
Come on, Thud Butt!

01:12:25.804 --> 01:12:28.014
- Everybody say grace.
- Bless this, Lord--

01:12:28.098 --> 01:12:29.516
Grace!

01:12:39.108 --> 01:12:41.402
All my favorite Never-foods.

01:12:41.486 --> 01:12:45.782
Yams, mammee apples
and banana squash.

01:12:45.782 --> 01:12:54.082
Wash it down with
calabash and poe-poe.

01:12:54.082 --> 01:12:56.501
Can you blow on this?

01:12:56.584 --> 01:12:57.502
Thank you.

01:13:22.318 --> 01:13:24.279
This is good.

01:13:37.083 --> 01:13:38.585
Are you eating that?

01:13:41.004 --> 01:13:43.089
No. Please.

01:13:43.214 --> 01:13:44.716
Eat.

01:13:44.716 --> 01:13:47.302
What's the deal?
Where's the real food?

01:13:47.385 --> 01:13:51.598
lf you can't imagine yourself being
Peter Pan, you won't be him, so eat up!

01:13:51.598 --> 01:13:54.684
Eat what? There's nothing here.
Gandhi ate more than this.

01:13:54.684 --> 01:13:57.020
This used to be
your favorite game.

01:13:57.104 --> 01:14:00.106
Forget the games. l want real food.
l want steak, eggs, coffee--

01:14:00.190 --> 01:14:01.107
You can't! Eat your heart out,
you crinkled, wrinkled fat-bag!

01:14:01.107 --> 01:14:05.195
You can't! Eat your heart out,
you crinkled, wrinkled fat-bag!

01:14:05.195 --> 01:14:08.114
- You're very ill-mannered.
- You're a slug-eating worm.

01:14:08.198 --> 01:14:11.201
- You can do better than that.
- You're encouraging them.

01:14:11.284 --> 01:14:13.495
Yeah, show me your fastball,
dust-brain.

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:16.414
You paunchy,
sag-bottomed puke pot!

01:14:16.498 --> 01:14:18.500
Bangerang, Rufio!

01:14:18.583 --> 01:14:21.586
You are a very poor role model
for these kids. Do you know that?

01:14:25.090 --> 01:14:27.008
l bet you don't have
a fourth-grade reading level.

01:14:27.092 --> 01:14:30.095
- Hemorrhoidal suck-navel.
- Maybe a fifth-grade reading level.

01:14:33.181 --> 01:14:36.810
Boil-dripping, beef-fart-sniffing

01:14:36.893 --> 01:14:38.812
Bangerang, Rufio!

01:14:38.895 --> 01:14:41.314
Someone has a severe ca-ca mouth.

01:14:41.397 --> 01:14:43.316
You are a fart factory...

01:14:43.399 --> 01:14:47.112
slug-slimed sack of rat guts
and cat vomit...

01:14:47.195 --> 01:14:51.116
cheesy, scab-picked,
pimple-squeezing finger bandage.

01:14:51.116 --> 01:14:53.785
A week-old maggot burger
with everything on it...

01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:56.204
and flies on the side!

01:14:58.498 --> 01:15:01.918
- Substitute chemistry teacher.
- Rufio, hit him back.

01:15:03.086 --> 01:15:04.003
Mung tongue.

01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:07.298
- Math tutor.
- Pinhead.

01:15:08.299 --> 01:15:09.801
- Prison barber.
- Mother lover.

01:15:09.884 --> 01:15:12.512
- Nearsighted gynecologist.
- ln your face, camel cake!

01:15:12.595 --> 01:15:16.099
- ln your rear, cow derriere.
- Lying, crying, spying ultra-pig!

01:15:16.182 --> 01:15:18.310
You lewd, crude, rude
bag-of-prechewed-food dude.

01:15:18.393 --> 01:15:20.187
Bangerang, Peter!

01:15:22.397 --> 01:15:25.692
You-- You man!
Stupid, stupid man!

01:15:25.817 --> 01:15:28.820
lf l'm a maggot burger,
why don't you just eat me?

01:15:28.903 --> 01:15:31.489
You two-toned, zebra-headed,
slime-coated...

01:15:31.614 --> 01:15:34.993
pimple-farmin', paramecium brain,
munchin' on your own mucus...

01:15:35.118 --> 01:15:37.204
suffering from Peter Pan envy!

01:15:37.287 --> 01:15:38.914
What's a paramecium brain?

01:15:38.997 --> 01:15:42.083
l'll tell you what a paramecium is.
That's a paramecium!

01:15:42.208 --> 01:15:45.587
lt's a one-celled critter
with no brain that can't fly!

01:15:45.712 --> 01:15:48.715
Don't mess with me, man.
l'm a lawyer!

01:15:48.798 --> 01:15:50.592
Banning. Banning.

01:15:55.388 --> 01:15:58.099
Rufio! Rufio!

01:15:58.099 --> 01:16:00.519
Banning is bangerang!

01:16:04.105 --> 01:16:04.397
Oh, Rufio, why don't you just
go suck on a dead dog's nose?

01:16:04.397 --> 01:16:16.618
Oh, Rufio, why don't you just
go suck on a dead dog's nose?

01:16:16.618 --> 01:16:19.412
- You're doing it.
- Doing what?

01:16:19.496 --> 01:16:22.082
Using your imagination, Peter.

01:16:48.107 --> 01:16:51.111
You're playing with us, Peter.

01:16:51.194 --> 01:16:53.196
You're doing it.

01:17:14.884 --> 01:17:16.803
Drink your poe-poe, Peter.

01:17:18.597 --> 01:17:21.099
How is it?

01:17:21.182 --> 01:17:22.601
Bangerang.

01:17:24.603 --> 01:17:25.979
Catch !

01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:36.489
Hey, Pockets, catch!

01:17:37.615 --> 01:17:39.993
Oh, Don't Ask.

01:17:53.882 --> 01:17:55.508
Bangerang!

01:18:03.517 --> 01:18:05.894
Hey, Pan the Man, catch this!

01:18:05.894 --> 01:18:08.313
- Peter, look out!
- Watch out!

01:18:40.887 --> 01:18:42.597
Bangerang.

01:18:58.613 --> 01:19:02.701
Peter, can l talk to you?

01:19:02.701 --> 01:19:04.619
Sure, Thud.

01:19:05.704 --> 01:19:07.581
l remember Tootles.

01:19:07.706 --> 01:19:09.708
- You do?
- He was lost too.

01:19:09.791 --> 01:19:12.085
How could you know Tootles?

01:19:12.210 --> 01:19:14.587
He was a Lost Boy.

01:19:14.587 --> 01:19:16.798
These are his marbles.

01:19:18.383 --> 01:19:21.011
These are his happy thoughts.

01:19:28.810 --> 01:19:32.605
- He really did lose his marbles.
- Yeah, he lost 'em good.

01:19:35.316 --> 01:19:37.402
- Peter, you know what?
- What?

01:19:37.485 --> 01:19:40.697
My happy thought will help you.

01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:42.907
What's your happy thought, Thud?

01:19:43.783 --> 01:19:46.703
Mine's my mother.

01:19:46.786 --> 01:19:49.581
Do you remember
your mother, Peter?

01:19:49.706 --> 01:19:51.583
Wish l could.

01:19:54.210 --> 01:19:55.587
Listen.

01:20:04.012 --> 01:20:04.387
At night when l'm alone

01:20:04.387 --> 01:20:08.391
At night when l'm alone

01:20:08.391 --> 01:20:11.686
l lie awake and wonder

01:20:11.812 --> 01:20:13.479
My mom sang that song.

01:20:13.605 --> 01:20:14.188
My young Jack, tell me about the game
of baseball. l can't remember.

01:20:14.188 --> 01:20:18.318
My young Jack, tell me about the game
of baseball. l can't remember.

01:20:18.318 --> 01:20:21.780
Are the mates standin'
or are they on horseback?

01:20:23.907 --> 01:20:24.908
The stars are all my friends

01:20:24.908 --> 01:20:28.995
The stars are all my friends

01:20:28.995 --> 01:20:32.916
Till the nighttime ends

01:20:32.999 --> 01:20:33.500
So l know l'm not alone

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:37.587
So l know l'm not alone

01:20:37.587 --> 01:20:40.006
When l'm here

01:20:40.006 --> 01:20:42.384
On my own

01:20:42.509 --> 01:20:42.884
lsn't that a wonder

01:20:42.884 --> 01:20:47.013
lsn't that a wonder

01:20:47.013 --> 01:20:47.305
When you're alone

01:20:47.305 --> 01:20:51.309
When you're alone

01:20:51.309 --> 01:20:55.188
You're not alone

01:20:55.313 --> 01:20:56.689
Not really alone

01:20:56.689 --> 01:21:44.696
Not really alone

01:21:44.696 --> 01:21:47.407
Good night, Neverland!

01:22:25.904 --> 01:22:28.615
What is it?
l hear it again.

01:22:30.116 --> 01:22:32.911
Smee, is that crocodile
back from the dead?

01:22:33.995 --> 01:22:35.997
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

01:22:38.416 --> 01:22:40.418
ls that the clock?

01:22:42.712 --> 01:22:46.299
You killed that croc years ago, Captain.
We smash every clock we find.

01:22:46.382 --> 01:22:48.802
The little elf
didn't know any better.

01:22:51.304 --> 01:22:53.014
To the museum at once.

01:23:06.986 --> 01:23:07.695
Shine 'em up! Put a fresh coat
of varnish on your peg right here!

01:23:07.695 --> 01:23:11.700
Shine 'em up! Put a fresh coat
of varnish on your peg right here!

01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:15.412
Treasure maps!
Authentic treasure maps!

01:23:25.088 --> 01:23:27.215
Broken clocks.

01:23:27.298 --> 01:23:27.715
Each one ticked its last tock,
and now all is well.

01:23:27.715 --> 01:23:32.887
Each one ticked its last tock,
and now all is well.

01:23:32.887 --> 01:23:35.599
- Just listen.
- l don't hear anything.

01:23:36.892 --> 01:23:40.020
l know!
Good form. Exactly.

01:23:40.103 --> 01:23:42.897
Jack, you see this?
Come over here.

01:23:42.981 --> 01:23:46.693
You can take it. This is Barbecue's
very own bedside clock.

01:23:46.693 --> 01:23:48.987
He was quite an infamous pirate.

01:23:48.987 --> 01:23:52.907
l smashed this clock
immediately after l gutted him.

01:23:52.991 --> 01:23:56.620
And his ship made
such a pretty bonfire on the waves.

01:24:04.210 --> 01:24:05.795
What is that...

01:24:05.879 --> 01:24:07.505
l hear?

01:24:09.090 --> 01:24:11.009
A ticking!

01:24:12.510 --> 01:24:15.096
Smee, stop it!
Stop the ticking!

01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:17.515
Stop it! Stop that tick!

01:24:19.309 --> 01:24:22.020
There's no tickin' here.
There's nothin' left to tick.

01:24:24.105 --> 01:24:26.191
Oh, my God.

01:24:26.316 --> 01:24:27.192
This is for the ticking
that might have been.

01:24:27.192 --> 01:24:31.279
This is for the ticking
that might have been.

01:24:31.279 --> 01:24:34.199
- Abso-floggin'-lutely!
- Get his father's watch.

01:24:36.993 --> 01:24:38.787
Go on.

01:24:38.912 --> 01:24:42.499
You know you want to.
Give it a try.

01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:45.001
Go on.

01:24:45.001 --> 01:24:47.295
This is for...

01:24:47.295 --> 01:24:50.090
never letting me blow bubbles
in my chocolate milk!

01:24:51.091 --> 01:24:53.593
- Yes!
- Good form! Bravo!

01:24:53.593 --> 01:24:55.720
Here you go.
lsn't that wonderful?

01:24:55.804 --> 01:24:59.307
This is for never letting me
jump on my own bed.

01:25:00.308 --> 01:25:03.186
Make time stand still, laddie.

01:25:03.311 --> 01:25:07.106
For always making promises
and breaking them.

01:25:07.190 --> 01:25:09.484
For never doing anything with me.

01:25:11.111 --> 01:25:13.488
For a father who's
never there, Jack.

01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:20.495
Jack, for a father
who didn't save you on the ship.

01:25:21.496 --> 01:25:23.582
He wouldn't save us.

01:25:23.707 --> 01:25:26.000
Who couldn't save you, Jack.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.712
He-- He wouldn't.
He didn't even try.

01:25:29.796 --> 01:25:33.091
He was there and we were there,
and he wouldn't try.

01:25:36.219 --> 01:25:39.180
Jack, he will try.

01:25:41.182 --> 01:25:43.602
And the question will be...

01:25:43.685 --> 01:25:47.188
when the time comes,
do you want to be saved?

01:25:48.606 --> 01:25:50.692
Don't you answer now.

01:25:50.817 --> 01:25:54.487
Now it's time to be
whatever you want to be.

01:25:56.197 --> 01:25:58.783
Put behind you
any thoughts of home...

01:25:58.908 --> 01:26:01.703
that place of broken promises.

01:26:02.704 --> 01:26:03.788
That what?

01:26:05.207 --> 01:26:08.418
Have l ever made a promise, Jack...

01:26:08.501 --> 01:26:11.504
l have not kept?

01:26:14.090 --> 01:26:16.092
Have l, son?

01:26:44.412 --> 01:26:46.790
Come on. Let's go.

01:26:55.006 --> 01:26:56.716
l don't like this game.

01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:59.886
Steal Hook's hook
as fast as you can.

01:27:00.011 --> 01:27:01.888
lt'll make you proud.

01:27:02.013 --> 01:27:05.183
Then you'll crow like Pan.

01:27:05.308 --> 01:27:16.486
Confound it, Druscilla, glove me.
The game is about to start.

01:27:16.486 --> 01:27:19.489
l need my bubbly.
Give me my bubbly.

01:27:24.786 --> 01:27:27.205
Steal Hook's hook, then crow.

01:27:47.184 --> 01:27:48.894
Jackie, boy!

01:27:49.019 --> 01:27:52.105
This is for all the games
your daddy missed.

01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:56.109
Hook would never
miss your games, son.

01:27:56.192 --> 01:27:58.111
You're almost there.
Just take it.

01:27:58.194 --> 01:28:00.780
- What's he looking at?
- You're this close.

01:28:00.905 --> 01:28:03.116
What's the matter?
lt's right there.

01:28:03.199 --> 01:28:04.618
Grab it.

01:28:06.912 --> 01:28:09.080
Come on, Jack.

01:28:09.206 --> 01:28:11.082
And-a-one...

01:28:12.792 --> 01:28:15.503
and-a-two,
and a toodle-loodle-loo!

01:28:21.718 --> 01:28:23.011
Strike!

01:28:23.094 --> 01:28:33.688
Wait for the good pitches.

01:28:33.688 --> 01:28:39.319
Jack, Jack, he's our man!
lf he can't do it, nobody can !

01:28:39.319 --> 01:28:40.779
He's stealing second!

01:28:45.492 --> 01:28:47.494
Stop it!

01:28:47.494 --> 01:28:51.581
We're playing this game according
to Master Jack's rules. Bad form.

01:28:51.581 --> 01:28:54.208
Sit down now.
Let's resume the game.

01:28:54.208 --> 01:28:56.419
Very violent sport,
isn't it, baseball?

01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:06.304
Run home, Jack!
Run home, Jack!

01:29:13.603 --> 01:29:15.480
''Run home, Jack.''

01:29:15.605 --> 01:29:19.692
Smee! No!
They've got it backwards!

01:29:19.692 --> 01:29:21.694
Tell them to turn it around!

01:29:21.694 --> 01:29:23.613
Maggie?

01:29:23.697 --> 01:29:25.782
Switch !

01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:32.706
Home run, Jack!

01:29:34.708 --> 01:29:37.085
Home run, Jack.

01:29:45.301 --> 01:29:47.387
He can't hit the curve.

01:30:12.579 --> 01:30:14.915
My Jack!

01:30:16.916 --> 01:30:18.209
My Jack.

01:30:27.510 --> 01:30:30.305
You did it!
Hoist him up!

01:30:34.684 --> 01:30:37.895
That's my boy!
You did it, son!

01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:49.908
Two, four, six, eight!

01:30:49.991 --> 01:30:52.285
Who do we appreciate?

01:30:52.410 --> 01:30:54.579
Jack! Jack!

01:31:16.017 --> 01:31:18.103
Gotta fly.

01:31:20.396 --> 01:31:22.398
Happy thought.

01:31:23.983 --> 01:31:26.694
One great big happy thought.

01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:28.780
Less is more.

01:31:30.615 --> 01:31:31.992
l can!

01:33:03.416 --> 01:33:06.085
''Tootles, Wendy...

01:33:06.085 --> 01:33:32.695
John, Michael, Peter.''

01:33:32.695 --> 01:33:36.616
Be careful, Peter.
You're a lot taller than you used to be.

01:33:37.909 --> 01:33:39.995
Well, say something.

01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:44.708
Do you like my dress?

01:33:48.503 --> 01:33:50.380
You look beautiful.

01:33:55.885 --> 01:33:59.514
- What's the occasion?
- You are.

01:34:00.515 --> 01:34:03.101
lt's a ''welcome home'' party.

01:34:08.314 --> 01:34:11.192
- What happened here?
- Hook.

01:34:11.317 --> 01:34:13.319
Burnt it when
you didn't come back.

01:34:34.090 --> 01:34:35.717
Kiss.

01:34:41.014 --> 01:34:42.599
Wendy.

01:34:45.685 --> 01:34:49.480
This is Wendy's house.
Noodles and Nibs built it for her.

01:34:52.692 --> 01:34:54.319
l remember.

01:34:56.613 --> 01:34:59.282
- Wendy used to sit in that chair.
- Yes.

01:34:59.282 --> 01:35:01.785
But it wasn't there.
lt was here.

01:35:03.119 --> 01:35:05.288
We used to sit here
while she'd darn socks...

01:35:05.413 --> 01:35:06.790
and tell us stories.

01:35:08.083 --> 01:35:10.418
She slept here.

01:35:10.501 --> 01:35:12.420
Tink, your apartment
was right here.

01:35:12.504 --> 01:35:13.880
Yes.

01:35:14.005 --> 01:35:19.386
Little Michael
had his basket bed right here.

01:35:19.386 --> 01:35:21.096
John.

01:35:28.812 --> 01:35:31.981
Taddy. My Taddy.

01:35:36.986 --> 01:35:39.906
Mother used to put him in the pram
to keep me company.

01:35:45.787 --> 01:35:47.914
l remember my mother.

01:35:48.999 --> 01:35:50.792
l remember her.

01:35:53.086 --> 01:35:56.381
You can be sure of
very fine schools indeed.

01:35:56.506 --> 01:35:57.006
First he will attend Whitehall,
then Oxford...

01:35:57.006 --> 01:36:01.094
First he will attend Whitehall,
then Oxford...

01:36:01.094 --> 01:36:03.513
and of course,
after graduation...

01:36:03.597 --> 01:36:07.309
he will prepare for a judgeship
in the highest court...

01:36:07.392 --> 01:36:10.312
making time for marriage
and family...

01:36:10.395 --> 01:36:13.815
and all of that,
just like his father.

01:36:13.898 --> 01:36:16.401
lsn't that what grown-ups
want for their children?

01:36:16.484 --> 01:36:18.486
l was afraid because
l didn't want to grow up...

01:36:18.611 --> 01:36:22.115
because everybody who grows up
has to die someday.

01:36:22.115 --> 01:36:24.117
So l ran away.

01:36:34.586 --> 01:36:37.213
Tink...

01:36:37.213 --> 01:36:40.008
you came and you saved me.

01:36:40.008 --> 01:36:43.720
You brought me to Neverland.
You taught me to fly.

01:36:46.806 --> 01:36:49.100
But l was still a little boy...

01:36:49.184 --> 01:36:51.394
and l missed my mother...

01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:54.480
so l decided to fly home
to my very own window.

01:36:55.982 --> 01:36:59.486
But it was shut.
They'd forgotten about me.

01:37:03.907 --> 01:37:06.284
l found other windows to visit...

01:37:06.409 --> 01:37:09.496
ones that weren't
shut closed on me.

01:37:09.579 --> 01:37:13.083
That's how l met Wendy.
l chased my shadow in her nursery.

01:37:13.208 --> 01:37:28.390
l expected my shadow and l
would join together like drops of water.

01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:30.016
Boy.

01:37:32.519 --> 01:37:34.395
Why are you crying?

01:37:36.689 --> 01:37:38.316
What's your name?

01:37:39.484 --> 01:37:43.196
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.
What's yours?

01:37:43.279 --> 01:37:50.287
l came back many times for Wendy,
always in the spring.

01:37:50.287 --> 01:37:53.290
And Wendy kept getting older...

01:37:53.415 --> 01:37:54.791
and older...

01:37:54.916 --> 01:37:59.003
and then l came back
the last time.

01:37:59.003 --> 01:38:01.714
Peter, l can't come with you.

01:38:01.798 --> 01:38:04.092
l've forgotten how to fly.

01:38:05.301 --> 01:38:07.220
l'm old, Peter.

01:38:08.305 --> 01:38:11.516
Ever so much more than 20.

01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:14.186
- l grew up a long time ago.
- No! No!

01:38:14.311 --> 01:38:16.896
- You promised.
- l have children of my own now.

01:38:16.896 --> 01:38:19.482
They have children of their own.

01:38:19.482 --> 01:38:20.316
That's my grandchild, Moira,
asleep in the bed.

01:38:20.316 --> 01:38:24.404
That's my grandchild, Moira,
asleep in the bed.

01:38:24.404 --> 01:38:26.698
When l saw her
lying there sleeping...

01:38:26.781 --> 01:38:29.784
that moment,
something changed in me forever.

01:38:29.909 --> 01:38:32.120
l shall give her a kiss.

01:38:33.288 --> 01:38:35.415
No, Peter.
No buttons.

01:38:35.415 --> 01:38:37.000
No thimbles.

01:38:37.083 --> 01:38:46.509
l couldn't bear Moira's heartbreak
when she finds she can't keep you.

01:38:46.509 --> 01:38:49.387
l mean a real kiss.

01:39:13.411 --> 01:39:16.581
l can see why you have trouble
finding a happy thought.

01:39:17.916 --> 01:39:20.793
So many sad memories, Peter.

01:39:22.295 --> 01:39:24.297
Bye, Taddy.

01:39:25.882 --> 01:39:29.302
Not Taddy. Daddy.

01:39:30.011 --> 01:39:31.304
Daddy!

01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:37.102
Peter, you're a daddy.

01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:42.106
Hi, Jack.

01:39:42.190 --> 01:39:46.111
l know why l came back.
l know why l grew up.

01:39:46.194 --> 01:39:49.489
l wanted to be a father.

01:39:49.614 --> 01:39:51.491
l'm a daddy.

01:39:53.702 --> 01:39:55.412
My happy thought.

01:39:56.288 --> 01:39:58.582
l got it.

01:39:58.582 --> 01:40:00.208
l found it!

01:40:02.585 --> 01:40:03.503
l lost it.

01:40:05.088 --> 01:40:08.091
Just hold that
happy thought, Peter!

01:40:35.118 --> 01:40:36.912
Peter Pan!

01:41:01.394 --> 01:41:02.979
Pan.

01:41:04.105 --> 01:41:06.107
He's back!

01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:03.999
Play!

01:42:33.111 --> 01:42:35.113
You are the Pan.

01:42:55.592 --> 01:42:56.593
You can fly, you can fight
and you can crow.

01:42:56.593 --> 01:43:46.685
You can fly, you can fight
and you can crow.

01:43:46.685 --> 01:43:48.311
Tink, you in there?

01:43:51.814 --> 01:43:55.485
- Are you sad?
- l'm neither. Please go away.

01:43:55.610 --> 01:43:57.112
Oh, you're sick.

01:43:57.195 --> 01:43:59.614
Maybe you need a Band-Aid
or a thermometer.

01:43:59.698 --> 01:44:02.200
Thermometer'd make it all better.
That's how Nibs made Wendy better.

01:44:02.284 --> 01:44:06.079
- No, Peter, it's not about that.
- Oh, yes it is.

01:44:06.204 --> 01:44:08.790
Nibs put the thermometer
in her mouth.

01:44:09.916 --> 01:44:11.501
Got all better.

01:44:13.795 --> 01:44:15.797
Don't we have
the greatest adventures?

01:44:17.590 --> 01:44:21.011
Do you remember your next great
adventure to save your kids, Peter?

01:44:21.803 --> 01:44:23.388
Kids?

01:44:24.681 --> 01:44:26.600
Peter Pan's got kids?

01:44:27.601 --> 01:44:29.519
Why are you in Neverland?

01:44:29.603 --> 01:44:31.479
Easy. To always be
a little boy and have fun.

01:44:31.604 --> 01:44:34.607
l like this game.
Ask me another one.

01:44:48.580 --> 01:44:50.916
Oh, dear me! l did it.

01:44:50.999 --> 01:44:54.502
Tink, look what happened.
You broke your house.

01:44:57.714 --> 01:44:59.299
You're humongous.

01:45:01.509 --> 01:45:04.387
This is the only wish
l ever wished for myself.

01:45:05.889 --> 01:45:08.808
Peter, this is the biggest feeling
l've ever felt.

01:45:08.892 --> 01:45:10.811
This is the biggest feeling
l've ever had...

01:45:10.894 --> 01:45:14.606
and this is the first time
l've been big enough to have it.

01:45:14.606 --> 01:45:17.817
Peter, l want to give you a kiss.

01:45:21.696 --> 01:45:23.782
No. l mean a real kiss.

01:45:29.704 --> 01:45:32.207
l love you, Peter Pan.

01:45:32.290 --> 01:45:34.500
- l love--
- Yes?

01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:36.920
- Her.
- Her who?

01:45:38.004 --> 01:45:40.799
More. Moira!

01:45:40.882 --> 01:45:42.884
l love Moira...

01:45:44.094 --> 01:45:46.596
and Jack and Maggie.

01:45:50.308 --> 01:45:52.185
Jack and Maggie.

01:45:57.398 --> 01:45:59.484
l have a plan.

01:46:00.819 --> 01:46:03.488
Come on.
You gotta come.

01:46:03.613 --> 01:46:06.616
When it's all over, you'll leave
and never come back again.

01:46:12.289 --> 01:46:14.291
What are you staring at, Peter?

01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:17.502
Save them.

01:46:17.502 --> 01:46:19.504
Go save them.

01:46:22.090 --> 01:46:23.508
You silly ass. Go.

01:47:04.799 --> 01:47:05.216
You know, Jack, it's a very special time
when a pirate gets his first earring.

01:47:05.216 --> 01:47:09.304
You know, Jack, it's a very special time
when a pirate gets his first earring.

01:47:09.304 --> 01:47:11.306
Such a very,
very beautiful feeling.

01:47:11.389 --> 01:47:14.601
lt's like the first time
you run someone through with your blade.

01:47:17.020 --> 01:47:17.979
Now, Jack, l'm going to ask you
to bend your head ever so slightly.

01:47:17.979 --> 01:47:21.983
Now, Jack, l'm going to ask you
to bend your head ever so slightly.

01:47:21.983 --> 01:47:24.486
A little more. That's it.

01:47:24.611 --> 01:47:26.696
And brace yourself, lad...

01:47:26.780 --> 01:47:27.197
because this
is really going to hurt.

01:47:27.197 --> 01:47:39.709
because this
is really going to hurt.

01:47:39.709 --> 01:47:42.086
Smee, what is that?

01:47:52.806 --> 01:47:55.308
Who is that, Captain?

01:47:59.104 --> 01:48:01.105
lt's Peter Pan.

01:48:01.105 --> 01:48:03.900
Has it been three days?

01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:05.902
'Tis true, Peter.

01:48:05.985 --> 01:48:08.405
Time does fly.

01:48:10.281 --> 01:48:12.993
And so do you, l see.

01:48:12.993 --> 01:48:13.702
How did you ever manage to fit
into those smashing tights again, Peter?

01:48:13.702 --> 01:48:21.918
How did you ever manage to fit
into those smashing tights again, Peter?

01:48:21.918 --> 01:48:24.712
Hand over my son now,
and you and your men may go free.

01:48:24.712 --> 01:48:26.798
Why don't you ask
the lad yourself?

01:48:26.881 --> 01:48:29.884
Jack, someone to see you, son.

01:48:33.888 --> 01:48:37.017
Jack, give me your hand.
We're going home.

01:48:37.017 --> 01:48:38.602
l am home.

01:48:39.686 --> 01:48:41.104
Good form.

01:48:41.187 --> 01:48:44.107
You see, Peter, he is my son.

01:48:44.107 --> 01:48:44.983
He loves me dearly and l'm prepared
to fight dearly for him.

01:48:44.983 --> 01:48:49.112
He loves me dearly and l'm prepared
to fight dearly for him.

01:48:49.112 --> 01:48:52.615
l've waited long
to shake your hand with this.

01:48:52.615 --> 01:48:55.493
Peter Pan,
prepare to meet thy doom.

01:48:56.411 --> 01:48:59.414
Dark and sinister man,
have at thee.

01:49:29.319 --> 01:49:31.279
Don't you love it, laddie?

01:49:31.404 --> 01:49:34.783
Once you shed blood and dole out
cruelty, it's hard to stop.

01:49:34.908 --> 01:49:37.285
lt's a pirate's life, my lad!

01:49:39.412 --> 01:49:42.999
-Don't l know him, Captain?
-No. You've never seen him in your life.

01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:47.795
You won't believe this,
but l've found my happy thought.

01:49:47.879 --> 01:49:51.091
lt took me three days to find it,
but guess what happened when l did?

01:49:51.216 --> 01:49:53.510
Up l went.

01:49:53.593 --> 01:49:55.387
You know what
my happy thought was?

01:49:59.683 --> 01:50:01.393
lt was you.

01:50:10.902 --> 01:50:14.989
That's my dad,
but he hates to fly.

01:50:14.989 --> 01:50:17.200
Bangerang!

01:50:19.286 --> 01:50:20.704
Bangerang!

01:50:56.990 --> 01:50:59.701
Call out the village militia!
We'll need every last man!

01:51:08.418 --> 01:51:09.294
lf there's anybody not fighting,
get here quick!

01:51:09.294 --> 01:51:22.182
lf there's anybody not fighting,
get here quick!

01:51:22.182 --> 01:51:23.016
Form ranks!

01:51:23.016 --> 01:51:28.313
Form ranks!

01:51:28.313 --> 01:51:31.107
Get ready to show 'em
the white light we're made of, boys!

01:51:31.107 --> 01:51:34.402
Remember the fires from hell
that forged you !

01:51:34.486 --> 01:51:36.613
Charge!

01:51:38.281 --> 01:51:38.990
Now!

01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:44.204
- Me eyes!
- l'm blind!

01:51:44.287 --> 01:51:47.207
We'll show you who's chicken!
Watch this!

01:52:10.605 --> 01:52:13.316
Smee, do something intelligent.

01:52:15.485 --> 01:52:18.113
Smee! Smee! What about Smee?

01:52:21.408 --> 01:52:25.120
What about Smee?
Smee's me. What about me?

01:52:33.002 --> 01:52:34.587
Thudball !

01:52:46.391 --> 01:52:47.309
Fire!

01:52:58.987 --> 01:53:00.780
Gangway!

01:53:02.490 --> 01:53:04.784
Look out below!

01:53:10.415 --> 01:53:13.418
Help! Somebody, help!

01:53:24.512 --> 01:53:26.097
Take it!

01:53:27.098 --> 01:53:29.809
Lost Boys, down!

01:53:35.815 --> 01:53:37.484
My eyes!

01:53:37.609 --> 01:53:40.612
lt's time for Smee.

01:53:50.789 --> 01:53:54.083
Where do you think you're going?
Get away from that window!

01:54:04.803 --> 01:54:06.012
Hook!

01:54:09.808 --> 01:54:12.102
Rufio.

01:54:15.396 --> 01:54:17.690
The old man is mine.

01:54:17.815 --> 01:54:19.901
Jack!

01:54:19.901 --> 01:54:21.611
Save me!

01:54:21.694 --> 01:54:23.405
My Maggie.

01:54:38.294 --> 01:54:40.004
Jack!

01:54:41.881 --> 01:54:44.592
- Wait. Ain't you--
- Peter Pan.

01:54:47.804 --> 01:54:49.681
- Come on.
- Daddy!

01:55:01.109 --> 01:55:04.195
Peter Pan's my...

01:55:04.195 --> 01:55:05.989
dad?

01:55:19.419 --> 01:55:21.212
- Maggie!
- Get it off me!

01:55:24.591 --> 01:55:26.593
l'll never lose you again.

01:55:29.679 --> 01:55:32.682
Lost Boys,
we got 'em on the run !

01:55:51.701 --> 01:55:53.203
Bangerang!

01:56:07.884 --> 01:56:10.011
Here comes Pan!

01:56:14.391 --> 01:56:16.101
Looky, looky, l got Hooky.

01:56:18.812 --> 01:56:20.688
Hook! No!

01:56:28.488 --> 01:56:31.616
- Do you know what l wish?
- What?

01:56:33.994 --> 01:56:34.494
l wish l had a dad...
like you.

01:56:34.494 --> 01:56:42.794
l wish l had a dad...
like you.

01:56:42.794 --> 01:56:45.588
Oh, Dad, l'm sorry.

01:56:55.891 --> 01:56:58.518
Are you ready for me, Peter?

01:56:59.603 --> 01:57:02.814
Come on. Humor the Hook.

01:57:02.814 --> 01:57:04.107
Dad?

01:57:11.114 --> 01:57:12.490
l wanna go home.

01:57:12.615 --> 01:57:15.285
What are you talking about?
You are home.

01:57:27.714 --> 01:57:29.883
Where are you going?

01:57:44.188 --> 01:57:45.398
Lost Boys!

01:57:45.481 --> 01:57:48.193
Victory banquet!

01:57:48.193 --> 01:57:50.612
Peter! Where are you going?

01:57:50.612 --> 01:57:53.114
Come back here and fight me!

01:57:53.198 --> 01:57:55.408
l'll find you wherever you are.
Do you hear me?

01:57:55.492 --> 01:57:57.702
Bad form, Peter! Come back!

01:57:57.786 --> 01:58:01.498
You need a mother
very, very badly!

01:58:04.292 --> 01:58:06.794
Smee, follow me.
Stairs.

01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:09.881
Just movin' your personals
somewhere safer.

01:58:11.883 --> 01:58:14.594
l swear to you, wherever you go,
wherever you are...

01:58:14.719 --> 01:58:15.220
l vow there will always be daggers
bearing notes signed ''James Hook.''

01:58:15.220 --> 01:58:19.307
l vow there will always be daggers
bearing notes signed ''James Hook.''

01:58:19.307 --> 01:58:20.016
They will be flung at the doors
of your children's children's children.

01:58:20.016 --> 01:58:24.104
They will be flung at the doors
of your children's children's children.

01:58:24.104 --> 01:58:25.980
Do you hear me?

01:58:36.116 --> 01:58:37.617
What do you want, old man?

01:58:41.913 --> 01:58:45.000
- Just you.
- You got me, James Hook.

01:58:49.212 --> 01:58:51.798
Pan the Avenger is back.

01:58:51.881 --> 01:58:55.802
And the Hook is waiting,
Peter Pan.

01:59:05.895 --> 01:59:08.106
Put up your swords.
lt's Hook or me this time.

01:59:08.189 --> 01:59:10.692
- Prepare to die, Peter.
- To die would be a great adventure.

01:59:10.692 --> 01:59:13.194
Death is the only adventure
you have left.

01:59:24.706 --> 01:59:43.683
- l remember you being a lot bigger.
- To a ten-year-old, l'm huge.

01:59:43.683 --> 01:59:45.811
No pain, no gain, James.

01:59:48.813 --> 01:59:50.106
Pan!

02:00:00.116 --> 02:00:01.993
Good form, old man.

02:00:06.414 --> 02:00:10.293
You know you're not really Peter Pan,
don't you? This is only a dream.

02:00:10.418 --> 02:00:12.795
When you wake up,
you'll just be Peter Banning...

02:00:12.879 --> 02:00:16.299
a cold, selfish man who drinks too much,
is obsessed with success...

02:00:16.382 --> 02:00:19.302
and runs and hides
from his wife and children.

02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:24.891
- l believe in you.
- l believe in you.

02:00:25.016 --> 02:00:26.518
l believe in you, Peter.

02:00:27.894 --> 02:00:29.979
l believe in you.

02:00:31.481 --> 02:00:33.483
You are the Pan.

02:00:33.608 --> 02:00:35.485
You're Peter Pan.

02:00:37.779 --> 02:00:39.781
l believe in you...

02:00:39.906 --> 02:00:41.616
Peter Pan.

02:01:01.302 --> 02:01:02.887
- Bad form!
- Stop!

02:01:04.097 --> 02:01:06.099
Now we end this.

02:01:15.316 --> 02:01:17.610
You blackguard!

02:01:28.205 --> 02:01:29.915
Hello.

02:01:29.998 --> 02:01:32.917
Tick-tock, tick-tock,
Hook's afraid of an ordinary clock.

02:01:32.917 --> 02:01:36.796
l think not. l think James Hook's
afraid of time ticking away!

02:01:57.901 --> 02:02:00.487
Good form, Peter.

02:02:00.612 --> 02:02:02.489
l am fallen.

02:02:05.283 --> 02:02:07.702
Give me my dignity.
You took my hand.

02:02:07.786 --> 02:02:09.996
You owe me something.

02:02:22.717 --> 02:02:23.301
You killed Rufio, you kidnapped
my children. You deserve to die.

02:02:23.301 --> 02:02:27.389
You killed Rufio, you kidnapped
my children. You deserve to die.

02:02:27.389 --> 02:02:30.100
Strike, Peter Pan.

02:02:30.183 --> 02:02:32.185
Strike true.

02:02:32.185 --> 02:02:34.104
Daddy...

02:02:34.104 --> 02:02:37.315
let's go home, please?

02:02:37.315 --> 02:02:40.401
He's just a mean old man
without a mommy.

02:02:41.194 --> 02:02:43.196
Yeah, Dad.
Let's go.

02:02:43.196 --> 02:02:45.699
He can't hurt us anymore.

02:02:45.699 --> 02:02:48.910
Bless you, child.
Good form, Jack.

02:02:48.994 --> 02:02:52.914
After all, what would
the world be like without...

02:02:54.416 --> 02:02:56.209
Captain Hook?

02:02:57.585 --> 02:03:01.381
l want you to take your ship and go.

02:03:01.506 --> 02:03:04.217
And l never want to see
your face in Neverland again.

02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:15.020
- Look out!
- Fools! James Hook is Neverland!

02:03:16.813 --> 02:03:19.691
Whenever children read,
it will say...

02:03:19.691 --> 02:03:22.902
''Thus perished Peter Pan.''

02:03:34.289 --> 02:03:36.291
What's happening?
What is happening?

02:04:00.398 --> 02:04:03.985
l want my mommy!

02:04:24.881 --> 02:04:27.008
Hook's gone.

02:04:33.306 --> 02:04:35.308
Bangerang!

02:04:38.603 --> 02:04:41.105
No more Hook!
No more Hook!

02:04:46.486 --> 02:04:48.488
Hooray for Pan the Man !

02:04:56.413 --> 02:04:58.790
What's wrong, Peter?

02:04:58.915 --> 02:05:00.792
l can't stay and play.

02:05:00.917 --> 02:05:03.211
l've done what l came to do
and now l have to go back.

02:05:03.294 --> 02:05:05.213
No, Peter, please.

02:05:07.715 --> 02:05:10.510
Tink, make my kids glow.

02:05:20.020 --> 02:05:22.105
Jack, Maggie...

02:05:22.188 --> 02:05:22.897
all you have to do is think one
happy thought, and you'll fly like me.

02:05:22.897 --> 02:05:30.905
all you have to do is think one
happy thought, and you'll fly like me.

02:05:30.905 --> 02:05:32.115
Mommy!

02:05:33.408 --> 02:05:35.911
My dad...

02:05:35.994 --> 02:05:38.079
Peter Pan.

02:05:41.791 --> 02:05:44.002
Tink, you know the way.

02:05:44.085 --> 02:05:46.504
l'll be just behind you.

02:06:08.109 --> 02:06:11.988
Don't leave us, Peter,
and don't say good-bye.

02:06:11.988 --> 02:06:13.907
What's good-bye?

02:06:13.990 --> 02:06:17.911
lt's going away. That's what it is.
Forgetting about us all over again.

02:06:17.994 --> 02:06:22.207
You're all my Lost Boys.
l'll never forget you.

02:06:22.207 --> 02:06:23.708
Never.

02:06:26.794 --> 02:06:28.797
So who do l leave in charge?

02:07:04.916 --> 02:07:07.919
l want you to take care
of everyone who's smaller than you.

02:07:08.002 --> 02:07:09.087
Okay.

02:07:09.212 --> 02:07:11.506
Then who do l look after?

02:07:12.507 --> 02:07:14.217
Neverbugs.

02:07:15.385 --> 02:07:17.304
Little ones.

02:07:39.409 --> 02:07:42.704
That was a great game.

02:08:23.620 --> 02:08:26.206
She looks like an angel.

02:08:26.289 --> 02:08:28.708
Let's not wake her yet.

02:09:15.588 --> 02:09:16.005
Oh, my dear child.
Have you been up all night?

02:09:16.005 --> 02:09:22.304
Oh, my dear child.
Have you been up all night?

02:09:22.304 --> 02:09:26.182

so often in my dreams...

02:09:26.182 --> 02:09:28.518
when l wake up,
they're still there.

02:09:31.813 --> 02:09:32.814

Say it, Peter.
Say it and mean it.

02:10:46.680 --> 02:10:48.807
l believe in fairies.

02:10:48.890 --> 02:10:52.185
You know that place
between asleep and awake?

02:10:52.310 --> 02:10:54.312
That place where
you still remember dreaming?

02:10:56.397 --> 02:10:59.818
That's where
l'll always love you...

02:10:59.901 --> 02:11:01.611
Peter Pan.

02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:06.199
That's where l'll be waiting.

02:11:26.302 --> 02:11:27.804
Nana!

02:11:27.804 --> 02:11:31.391
Oh, give us a kiss.

02:12:07.218 --> 02:12:09.095
Lost Boys.

02:12:09.179 --> 02:12:11.890

02:12:11.890 --> 02:12:12.515
l'd love to chat, but l gotta
climb a drainpipe right now.

02:12:12.515 --> 02:12:16.603
l'd love to chat, but l gotta
climb a drainpipe right now.

02:12:16.603 --> 02:12:18.813
Why? 'Cause l ran out
of fairy dust.

02:12:18.897 --> 02:12:21.399

''Why?''

02:12:27.906 --> 02:12:31.201

Excuse me.
Do you have an appointment?

02:12:46.591 --> 02:12:49.594
What did l tell you
about this window?

02:12:49.719 --> 02:12:51.304
Always keep it open !

02:12:53.098 --> 02:12:55.809
Never, ever, ever close it!

02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:17.289
l have to take this.

02:13:17.289 --> 02:13:17.914
Brad, have you ever wondered what it's
like to feel the exhilaration of flying?

02:13:17.914 --> 02:13:22.001
Brad, have you ever wondered what it's
like to feel the exhilaration of flying?

02:13:22.001 --> 02:13:24.379
Feel this.

02:13:24.504 --> 02:13:26.381

02:13:29.300 --> 02:13:31.886
To infinity and back again.

02:13:32.012 --> 02:13:34.180
Hello, Peter.

02:13:34.306 --> 02:13:37.184

02:13:39.311 --> 02:13:42.397

02:13:53.700 --> 02:13:56.286

A tear for every happy thought.
