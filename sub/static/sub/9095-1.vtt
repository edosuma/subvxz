00:38.705 --> 00:42.624
An eight-year-old boy from Manhattan
was delivered dead on arrival today-

02:33.236 --> 02:35.154
The Centers for Disease Control.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.197
Are we dealing with an epidemic?

02:37.282 --> 02:40.367
Whatever the carrier,
we know that it's not the water.

02:40.451 --> 02:42.870
We don't believe that it's airborne.

02:42.954 --> 02:46.832
One, two, three, four--

03:11.524 --> 03:15.235
Strickler's Disease
was first diagnosed two years ago.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.741
We're no better off now.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.376
I needed you
to see this for yourself, Dr. Tyler.

03:34.589 --> 03:37.049
It's the same
at every hospital in the city.

03:37.133 --> 03:41.094
For the lucky ones,
it's a lifetime in leg braces.

03:44.015 --> 03:46.850
Most of these kids won't make it.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.452
We need your help.

06:18.419 --> 06:21.004
Strickler's Disease came to New York...

06:21.089 --> 06:24.007
like a thief in the night,
threatening to steal...

06:24.092 --> 06:27.427
an entire generation of our children
from before our eyes.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.846
Dr. Peter Mann, Deputy Director
of the Centers for Disease Control--

06:29.931 --> 06:33.600
The killer was cunning. It was deadly.

06:33.684 --> 06:37.771
Neither a cure
nor a vaccine could be found.

06:37.855 --> 06:40.023
We at the CDC had to contain it...

06:40.108 --> 06:42.859
before it could spread
beyond Manhattan Island.

06:42.944 --> 06:46.238
So we went after its carrier,
the common cockroach.

06:46.322 --> 06:48.949
Or rather she did.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.535
Dr. Susan Tyler is the reason
that there hasn't been...

06:51.619 --> 06:54.913
a new case of Strickler's
in this city for six months.

06:54.997 --> 06:56.915
Dr. Susan Tyler.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.917
Dr. Susan Tyler,
Professor of Entomology...

06:59.001 --> 07:00.919
at the New York State University.

07:01.003 --> 07:03.505
Thank you, Peter.

07:03.589 --> 07:07.676
I don't think I need to tell you
New Yorkers just how resilient...

07:07.760 --> 07:11.138
the common cockroach is.

07:11.222 --> 07:14.516
Since it has proven to be
virtually immune to chemical control...

07:14.600 --> 07:16.726
we had to find a new avenue of attack.

07:16.811 --> 07:21.231
So, with the aid of genetics labs
across the country...

07:21.315 --> 07:26.486
we recombined termite and mantid DNA
to create a biological counteragent...

07:26.571 --> 07:30.157
a new species to be our six-legged ally...

07:30.241 --> 07:33.660
in wiping out the roach population.

07:34.745 --> 07:38.123
We call it the "Judas" breed.

07:38.207 --> 07:42.377
Once in contact with
the Judas' secretions...

07:42.462 --> 07:44.921
the common roaches
were infected with an enzyme...

07:45.006 --> 07:47.090
which caused their metabolism
to go into overdrive.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.341
Come on, Susan!

07:48.426 --> 07:49.759
You're missing it.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.595
No matter how much
the common roaches ate...

07:51.679 --> 07:53.597
every last member of the nest...

07:53.681 --> 07:56.099
starved to death within a matter of hours.

07:56.184 --> 07:58.602
I hope someone's taping this.

07:58.686 --> 08:00.604
This announcement's been
a long time coming...

08:00.688 --> 08:02.689
- ladies and gentlemen.
- Coming home.

08:02.773 --> 08:06.943
The Strickler's outbreak
has officially been contained.

08:07.028 --> 08:11.740
- The epidemic is over.
- Hey, Susan. Honey.

08:11.824 --> 08:12.782
Any other questions?

08:12.867 --> 08:14.826
Dr. Mann, what did this victory
mean to you personally?

08:14.911 --> 08:17.746
It means that I can
move on to other projects with the...

08:17.830 --> 08:21.166
Our 15 minutes are gone.

08:21.250 --> 08:25.086
And personally
it's where I met my wife.

08:25.171 --> 08:29.966
What is this? Is this
some kind of Catholic guilt thing?

08:30.051 --> 08:33.303
We don't even know
what the impact is of what we did.

08:33.386 --> 08:35.304
The impact is that...

08:35.389 --> 08:38.433
a lot of kids will be running around
next year because of you.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.434
A lot of kids.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.522
- Hey!
- Maybe we get lucky.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.150
Maybe a couple of them'll be ours someday.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.152
Oh, a couple, huh?

08:49.237 --> 08:50.904
Oh, okay. We're not rushing things.

08:50.988 --> 08:53.448
I didn't want to overtax you.
It's been a hard year.

08:54.742 --> 08:56.660
It's been a great year.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.016
Oxfords. Seven and a half.

10:43.100 --> 10:46.269
Black. Leather soles.

11:52.962 --> 12:05.014
Funny, funny shoes.

12:05.099 --> 12:07.058
Funny--

12:10.396 --> 12:14.107
Can you raise it a little bit on the left?
It's sort of drooping. Don't you think?

12:16.944 --> 12:19.446
Husband, incoming, 6:00.

12:21.657 --> 12:24.868
- I'm sorry I was late.
- Everything crazy out there today?

12:24.952 --> 12:27.412
I got T.B. breaking out
all over the city...

12:27.496 --> 12:30.123
and the mayor's in my face
about scaring off another convention.

12:30.207 --> 12:32.792
It's Bruce.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.627
I'll call him later.

12:34.712 --> 12:38.465
So, nice lunch, huh?

12:39.425 --> 12:41.301
- Very nice lunch.
- Choose.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.262
- What's this?
- Come on, choose.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.769
Oh, honey, why'd you get this?

12:50.853 --> 12:52.687
Baby in a bottle.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.191
It's ours.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.734
Dr. Chadwick said
if you take that twice a we--

12:57.818 --> 13:01.196
- Do you know where this comes from?
- Sure.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.324
It comes from the urine
of Italian menopausal nuns.

13:05.409 --> 13:08.661
So? Monks bottle their own wine, so--

13:09.705 --> 13:11.664
Not natural, Peter.

13:14.502 --> 13:17.253
Would you at least think about this?

13:17.338 --> 13:18.963
For the last six months...

13:19.048 --> 13:22.342
I've been the one running around
with ice in my underwear.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.471
And that's not natural.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.520
I really got to go.

13:35.731 --> 13:37.732
See you.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.750
Hold it right there, sir.

13:57.378 --> 14:01.589
CDC.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.884
Hey, Boss, welcome to disease land.

14:04.969 --> 14:07.595
- Tuck it in.
- All right. All right.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.597
We sure this is yellow fever?

14:09.682 --> 14:12.350
- What, are you ignoring your pages now?
- Listen, l--

14:12.434 --> 14:15.186
Okay, these two cops saw the broken scaffold,
and then the paint mess here.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.063
And then they looked
through that cellar window.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.567
Go ahead. Take a look.

14:30.786 --> 14:32.120
Pleasant, isn't it?

14:32.204 --> 14:36.124
Couldn't let 'em out
until you gave me the okay, so--

14:36.208 --> 14:40.753
This piece of shit chapel here
is a front for the Triads.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.006
Chinese mob.

14:43.090 --> 14:46.509
The snake had people in from UNAD.
Slave labor.

14:46.594 --> 14:48.094
How long have they been operating?

14:48.178 --> 14:50.346
I don't know. Five, six years. Too long.

14:50.431 --> 14:53.641
- Oh, have you had lunch?
- Uh-huh.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.352
Try to keep it down
when you see this, okay?

15:13.245 --> 15:15.955
Roughly three dozen people
were trapped in here.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.708
One toilet, no paper.

15:18.792 --> 15:22.795
We got bacterial samples reading off the
scale, though nothing's airborne.

15:23.464 --> 15:26.966
- We got a Reverend Harry Ping.
- Preacher?

15:27.051 --> 15:30.219
Yeah. Preacher, if you can imagine that.
He ran this place.

15:30.804 --> 15:32.013
But there's no sign of him.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.106
So what do you say, boss?

15:42.191 --> 15:45.068
Quarantine 'em.
Quarantine the cops that found it.

15:45.152 --> 15:47.570
Quarantine anybody who touched anything.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.614
Immigration's gonna love you.

15:49.698 --> 15:52.033
Tell 'em to send the flowers
to the usual address.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.160
You got it.

15:57.998 --> 16:00.750
Piece of shit on the ceiling.

16:00.834 --> 16:02.919
- Figure that one out.
- Here you go, Josh.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.338
The subway?

16:05.422 --> 16:08.091
You know what?
This is what I love about my job.

16:08.175 --> 16:10.635
I get to travel, see the world...

16:10.719 --> 16:12.845
and meet new exotic cultures.

16:12.930 --> 16:16.474
It's... It's all bacterial,
but hey, what the fuck, right?

16:22.147 --> 16:26.025
You're gonna be okay.
We'll take care of you.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.486
Hey, she doesn't speak English.

16:29.738 --> 16:31.948
You tell her, please.

17:00.060 --> 17:02.145
Man, she's delirious.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.276
- What's she saying?
- I don't know.

17:08.359 --> 17:12.821
She keeps saying
something like the dark angels.

17:12.906 --> 17:15.450
She says they're coming to get her.

17:15.534 --> 17:18.869
Chinese people, man.
They come up with some pretty wild stuff.

17:20.289 --> 17:22.832
- Thanks a lot, Miguel.
- Board up every exit.

17:22.915 --> 17:26.085
If this leads to the subways,
I don't want anything to spread.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.087
Quarantine everybody.

17:37.598 --> 17:43.519
But in the middle of the third date,
he tells me that he wears women's underwear.

17:44.396 --> 17:45.772
What a pervert.

17:45.856 --> 17:48.107
This city is full of perverts.

17:49.318 --> 17:51.194
Some of your fans.

17:51.278 --> 17:54.447
- You're the bug lady, right?
- That's me.

17:54.531 --> 17:55.782
We're here to deal.

17:57.826 --> 18:00.411
When you pick them up, you should
pick 'em up by this front vein on the wing...

18:00.496 --> 18:02.538
'cause it's the strongest part
of the wing.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.123
See, that way you don't break it.

18:04.208 --> 18:07.627
Now, let's see what else
you have in here. Oh, look.

18:07.711 --> 18:10.671
- What do we have here?
- Swallowtail?

18:10.756 --> 18:14.258
- Excellent.
- How come you like bugs so much?

18:17.471 --> 18:19.680
Just imagine that you're one of them.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.600
What, eating furniture and stuff?
That's gotta suck.

18:22.684 --> 18:24.519
No, no, no.
Now, don’t judge them too quickly.

18:24.603 --> 18:28.314
These guys were building castles while
dinosaurs were still wimpy little lizards.

18:33.862 --> 18:36.948
Now, say you’re him.
He's what we call a soldier.

18:37.032 --> 18:39.826
Now, there is no way
that you would ever quit fighting...

18:39.910 --> 18:42.203
no matter how badly injured you were.

18:42.287 --> 18:44.205
It would be a battle to the death.

18:47.417 --> 18:50.253
But most insects don't kill...

18:50.337 --> 18:52.255
unless their territory is invaded.

18:52.339 --> 18:55.716
You'd just stun your prey up here.

18:55.801 --> 18:59.887
And then you drag it all the way down
through here to there...

18:59.972 --> 19:02.723
into what is kind of like a pantry.

19:04.643 --> 19:05.601
We eat it alive?

19:05.686 --> 19:09.355
Yeah. You're not really squeamish
about those kind of things.

19:09.439 --> 19:12.775
This is the nest.
It's the heart of the colony.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.360
The big enchilada.

19:14.444 --> 19:17.989
- Why?
- If anything were to happen to the nest...

19:18.073 --> 19:19.991
the entire colony would die out.

19:20.075 --> 19:21.868
I'd just bail and start my own.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.786
Well, you couldn't do that.

19:23.871 --> 19:27.331
See... that big guy there?
Next to the queen?

19:27.416 --> 19:29.375
Wait. Look over there.

19:29.459 --> 19:33.462
He's the king. And out of all the nest,
he's the only fertile male.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.464
He got a good deal.

19:35.549 --> 19:38.217
Yeah.

19:38.302 --> 19:41.179
It's a simple structure
designed for their survival.

19:41.263 --> 19:44.098
It's perfectly balanced,
and it's very beautiful.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.100
Whatever peels your banana, lady.

19:46.185 --> 19:49.103
So, you wanna buy
the butterflies, or what?

19:49.188 --> 19:50.771
You know what?

19:50.856 --> 19:53.816
You guys have done a really good job.
So, how about five bucks?

19:53.901 --> 19:55.276
That's your best?

19:55.360 --> 19:58.029
- I'm gonna show her the weird bug.
- Costs a dollar just to look.

19:58.113 --> 20:00.364
It's a really great bug.
Got it on the subway.

20:00.449 --> 20:03.701
- We kind of broke it a little.
- Okay. My best offer.

20:03.785 --> 20:07.997
Ten bucks for everything, plus a specimen
jar, some tweezers and some mounts.

20:08.081 --> 20:09.999
Deal.

20:10.083 --> 20:13.794
Are you crazy? This is the best.
This is our meal ticket.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.923
Come on. Bug's almost dead anyway.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.272
It's yours.

20:33.357 --> 20:36.525
- You gave 'em ten bucks.
- They're from Alphabet City.

20:36.610 --> 20:39.820
There's much worse things
they could be selling.

20:39.905 --> 20:43.366
Oh, no. Your papers.
Help me get the window.

20:43.450 --> 20:45.660
Susan. Push.

20:45.744 --> 20:48.412
- Oh, come on.
- Oh, I hate this window.

20:48.497 --> 20:51.165
Okay, on three. One, two, three.

20:58.423 --> 21:02.343
Who the hell do you think you are
putting my two officers on quarantine?

21:02.427 --> 21:05.388
Listen to me, Captain.
Those two, they go home...

21:05.472 --> 21:07.890
they kiss their wives,
they kiss their kids...

21:07.975 --> 21:09.892
and I'm the one with
a full-blown epidemic--

21:09.977 --> 21:12.436
Come on, Chuy. We have to make dinner.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.897
- Dinner.
- I don't care.

21:14.982 --> 21:16.899
Well, I do care! Jesus, God, I hate cops.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.901
They make the worst coffee.

21:18.986 --> 21:24.657
- Shiny wire.
- Don't stare. People look back if you stare.

21:24.741 --> 21:28.452
I've had limited success with
this combination of pheromones...

21:28.537 --> 21:30.913
because it tends to wear off.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.165
But now, watch this male when I add sound.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.796
See, this is a female
I recorded in the field.

21:39.548 --> 21:43.217
Look at him go.
It's like the Donna Summer of cricketdom.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.846
Wow. He wants it bad.

21:47.681 --> 21:49.932
Siren song.

21:50.017 --> 21:53.269
If we put these speakers
in fields that are overinfested...

21:53.353 --> 21:56.355
we can collect the males,
save the crops...

21:56.440 --> 21:58.774
and restore the balance of the ecosystem.

21:58.859 --> 22:01.277
All without putting
harmful chemicals in food.

22:05.073 --> 22:07.033
What the hell?

22:49.409 --> 22:51.619
Shit!

22:51.703 --> 22:55.790
Those kids, we've gotta find them.

23:01.088 --> 23:03.631
- I can't believe this.
- What?

23:03.715 --> 23:07.259
I spend an hour in the field.
I get a weekend's worth of crap.

23:07.344 --> 23:10.721
Oh, speaking of that.
That turd that I took to the lab?

23:13.100 --> 23:15.726
I found these in it.

23:17.938 --> 23:19.063
What are they?

23:19.147 --> 23:21.565
- Buttons.
- Buttons?

23:21.650 --> 23:23.901
Maybe they needed fiber.

23:55.934 --> 23:57.852
Wow.

23:57.936 --> 24:01.856
Oh, my God. You’re just a baby.

24:36.349 --> 24:38.476
Oh, my God.

24:46.860 --> 24:50.070
The transfer
of recombinant genetic material...

24:50.155 --> 24:54.033
from termites and mantids into Judas breed
will allow rapid enzymatic change...

24:56.495 --> 24:59.830
...insuring 100% sterility
in all Judas females...

25:02.083 --> 25:04.543
...utilization of a suicide gene...

25:07.464 --> 25:11.217
...leading to a life expectancy
of 120 to 180 days.

27:59.010 --> 28:01.303
Not too little...

28:01.388 --> 28:04.223
and not too much.

28:10.230 --> 28:12.690
You rub it in.

28:12.774 --> 28:15.818
Around and around.

28:15.902 --> 28:17.778
Like this, huh?

28:17.862 --> 28:20.781
Let the leather take it.

28:24.327 --> 28:26.537
Funny shoes.

28:26.621 --> 28:29.540
Aieee. Mr. Funny Shoes.

28:38.591 --> 28:40.592
No one is there.

28:40.677 --> 28:42.594
It's empty.

28:43.847 --> 28:46.348
Chuy, listen to me.

28:46.433 --> 28:50.185
They have Jesus on the cross...

28:50.270 --> 28:53.731
but that is not a holy place.

28:56.276 --> 28:58.277
Can you call me back tonight?

28:58.361 --> 29:00.696
Thanks, Officer.

29:00.780 --> 29:03.449
Cops are on it.

29:04.284 --> 29:05.451
Good.

29:06.453 --> 29:08.537
Well, they said--

29:08.621 --> 29:12.708
Can you do me a favor
and hold off working at night for awhile?

29:12.792 --> 29:15.335
I can't do that. I was actually
thinking I had to get back...

29:15.420 --> 29:19.339
Susan, someone broke into
your office, okay?

29:19.424 --> 29:21.550
I'm sorry about you losing your specimen...

29:21.634 --> 29:24.720
- but let's try and get our priorities straight.
- This is not just a specimen.

29:24.804 --> 29:29.057
I did a pH test, and there are only
two species that match what I found.

29:29.142 --> 29:31.810
Now, one of them
is a leafcutter ant in the Amazon.

29:31.895 --> 29:35.814
The other one
we released here three years ago.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.279
You said--

29:44.157 --> 29:47.910
You said the ones we released
only had a life span of six months.

29:47.994 --> 29:50.621
We engineered them to be sterile adults.

29:50.705 --> 29:53.081
The Judases were not supposed to last
past one generation.

29:53.166 --> 29:56.919
- So what happened?
- The one I examined today was a baby.

29:57.003 --> 30:00.380
They were designed to die.
They are breeding.

30:09.682 --> 30:12.518
I shine them good.

30:16.689 --> 30:20.275
Chuy, Black Lincoln. Chuy?

30:20.360 --> 30:23.612
Black Lincoln. This one.

30:23.696 --> 30:25.614
Chuy...

30:25.698 --> 30:27.574
pay attention, please.

30:46.636 --> 30:48.554
This is where you found the bug?

30:48.638 --> 30:51.056
Yeah, man. But they changed the lock.

30:54.727 --> 30:56.812
You sure you haven't seen one of those?

30:56.896 --> 30:59.815
No. What is it?

30:59.899 --> 31:03.819
It's an ootheca. It's kind of
a fancy name for an egg case.

31:03.903 --> 31:07.030
There's probably more,
like, weird bugs inside of it.

31:07.115 --> 31:09.908
No way. I see one of those, I puke.

31:17.292 --> 31:19.668
Here you go.

31:19.752 --> 31:23.046
- Here.
- Hold on.

31:23.131 --> 31:25.757
Is there money to be made
on this egg thing?

31:25.842 --> 31:28.302
- Sorry.
- Dealing days are over. Vamonos.

31:28.386 --> 31:31.221
These egg things look nasty.

31:31.306 --> 31:33.015
Thought you liked finding nasty things.

31:33.099 --> 31:35.893
Well, what if we go find these things.
She'll pay us, right?

31:35.977 --> 31:37.978
Is that all you think about?

31:44.652 --> 31:47.070
Come on.

32:10.428 --> 32:12.804
This bug. What does it look like?

32:23.650 --> 32:25.817
Did you hear that?

32:55.890 --> 32:58.850
- How deep does this go?
- Let's see.

33:05.358 --> 33:07.776
Let's take a look.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.118
- You see anything?
- Not yet.

33:19.205 --> 33:21.623
Shit.

33:21.708 --> 33:23.709
I dropped it.

33:23.793 --> 33:27.087
I can't reach it.

33:27.171 --> 33:29.381
Let me try. My hands are smaller.

33:46.774 --> 33:49.943
- Just leave it.
- Well, no. Wait. I think I'm almost there.

33:57.702 --> 34:00.620
I already told you this is CDC business.

34:00.705 --> 34:03.790
And I'm telling you that
those lockers are MTA business.

34:03.875 --> 34:06.543
Okay, we'll-- we'll pay for the lock
that we broke, Officer.

34:06.627 --> 34:08.754
- I mean, whatever we can do...
- Lady, who am I talking to now?

34:08.838 --> 34:11.465
- You or him?
- You're talking to me, okay? You're talking to me.

34:14.260 --> 34:15.594
All we wanna see is...

34:15.678 --> 34:17.387
See what? That's the old
maintenance bridge, buddy.

34:17.472 --> 34:19.389
This insect that we are looking for...

34:19.474 --> 34:21.516
Look, man. Your lady want a bug...

34:21.601 --> 34:25.103
or its eggs, or whatever she wants,
that's fine by me.

34:25.188 --> 34:28.065
But it's like Swiss cheese down there.

34:28.149 --> 34:31.610
Tunnels in, tunnels out, old tracks.

34:31.694 --> 34:35.322
You go messing around, break your neck,
and it's my ass on the line.

34:35.406 --> 34:39.034
Lace-up shoes. Black. Nine West.

34:39.118 --> 34:41.911
Chuy, finish your sandwich.

34:41.996 --> 34:44.081
It's good. It's chicken.

34:44.165 --> 34:46.833
Penny loafers. Eleven.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.168
Double E.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.511
Hey.

34:59.847 --> 35:02.390
- He's really good at that.
- Oh, yes.

35:02.475 --> 35:05.435
He imitates anything.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.979
Doesn't he go to school?

35:09.857 --> 35:13.318
He doesn't need school. He's special.

35:14.403 --> 35:16.947
What you making there?
Is that a superhero?

35:17.990 --> 35:20.408
Mr. Funny Shoes.

35:20.493 --> 35:23.286
He knows everything about shoes.

35:23.371 --> 35:25.705
- Hey, I'm talking to you.
- No, you're talking at me!

35:25.790 --> 35:29.000
You come back with the proper permits.
Maybe we'll have a conversation.

35:29.085 --> 35:31.878
- Great. We'll do lunch.
- Yeah, I look forward to it.

35:34.048 --> 35:36.675
Uptown.

35:36.759 --> 35:37.884
What happened?

35:37.969 --> 35:41.346
Napoleon is alive and well
and working for the MTA.

35:41.430 --> 35:43.348
We have to get down there.

35:43.432 --> 35:45.851
He wants a permit?
I'll give him a real special one.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.373
What's that?

36:21.512 --> 36:23.930
Is that the egg thing?

36:26.142 --> 36:28.351
Give me a hand.

36:29.729 --> 36:31.897
Oh, man, that smells.

37:00.009 --> 37:01.927
I can hear the bugs inside.

37:02.011 --> 37:06.014
Come on. Cut it.
She's gonna give us at least 40 bucks.

37:25.368 --> 37:26.576
What's up?

37:27.578 --> 37:29.788
I think there's a guy down there.

37:37.713 --> 37:41.800
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

37:42.927 --> 37:45.679
Oh, shit! It's got me!

37:49.267 --> 37:52.644
Help! Oh, God, please! Please, help me!

37:56.732 --> 37:59.150
Alex!

38:13.291 --> 38:17.794
A philosopher named Hobbes
once wrote that...

38:17.878 --> 38:21.381
"Life, by its very nature,
is nasty, brutish and short. "

38:21.465 --> 38:23.925
An ant would put it more succinctly:

38:24.010 --> 38:25.969
Can I eat it or will it eat me?

38:26.053 --> 38:29.097
It's this kind of simplicity...

38:29.181 --> 38:32.058
that governs the phylum Insecta.

38:36.272 --> 38:37.772
Hello?

38:37.857 --> 38:40.775
- It's me. I got the permits.
- You did?

38:40.860 --> 38:43.320
- We're going down first thing tomorrow.
- Okay, that's great.

38:43.404 --> 38:45.655
Listen, honey, I gotta go right now.
I'll call you later.

38:45.740 --> 38:48.033
- ... or of cellular phones...
- Okay.

38:48.117 --> 38:50.702
as my distinguished colleague
can tell you.

38:52.288 --> 38:55.790
So, you think your little Frankenstein
has got the better of you?

38:55.875 --> 38:58.043
I was hoping you could tell me.

38:58.127 --> 39:01.171
I really need to find
some answers, Walter.

39:01.255 --> 39:03.214
Dear Susan...

39:04.759 --> 39:08.720
is it answers you want from me,
or is it absolution?

39:09.764 --> 39:12.182
You still think
making the Judases was wrong?

39:13.517 --> 39:16.311
Three years ago,
I would've called it unforgivable.

39:18.356 --> 39:23.026
But I have two grandchildren who are
alive today probably because of you.

39:24.904 --> 39:28.823
It would be a tad hypocritical
for me to pass judgement.

39:28.908 --> 39:30.784
That's not an answer, Walter.

39:32.244 --> 39:34.162
It's not an easy question.

39:34.246 --> 39:38.083
But as to the Judases...

39:38.167 --> 39:41.002
I think it's likely some survived.

39:42.755 --> 39:46.257
Evolution has a way
of keeping things alive.

39:47.301 --> 39:49.761
But they all died in the lab.

39:51.138 --> 39:55.558
Yes, Susan.
But you let them out... into the world.

39:57.770 --> 40:00.480
The world's a much bigger lab.

42:52.653 --> 42:54.612
Funny shoes.

43:27.813 --> 43:31.816
Hold on. Something's blocking filter "D."

43:33.402 --> 43:36.487
Something's blocking filter "D"!

43:51.128 --> 43:53.004
Jules, come on, man. Hurry it up.

43:53.714 --> 43:55.048
Fuck off.

43:55.132 --> 43:56.883
It's not a date.

44:07.770 --> 44:09.228
Oh, God.

44:09.313 --> 44:10.647
What's the problem?

44:12.524 --> 44:14.859
I think it's a kid.

44:27.456 --> 44:31.250
- Yeah.
- Hi, Peter. It's Remy.

44:31.335 --> 44:35.046
- Yeah, hi.
- Is Susan there? I need to talk to her.

44:35.130 --> 44:37.340
- How you doin'?
- Fine.

44:37.424 --> 44:38.675
It's really important.

44:38.759 --> 44:40.718
Yeah, sure.

45:13.585 --> 45:16.629
What are you doing?

45:16.714 --> 45:18.798
What do you got there?

45:18.882 --> 45:21.008
- Where?
- Right down there. In your hand.

45:21.093 --> 45:24.929
- Nothing.
- Oh, are we testing it?

45:25.013 --> 45:26.639
Maybe.

45:26.724 --> 45:31.269
- Are we testing it?
- Uh-huh, maybe. I don't know. Could be.

45:31.353 --> 45:33.855
- It's Remy.
- Oh, good. Okay. So give me the phone.

45:33.939 --> 45:36.649
Come on. Come here.

45:36.734 --> 45:39.444
Give me the phone.

45:39.528 --> 45:41.320
- Are we testing it?
- Yes.

45:41.405 --> 45:43.114
Can you hold on, Remy?

45:47.119 --> 45:49.036
Hey. What's up?

45:54.209 --> 45:56.544
- They found what?
- At the water filtration plant.

45:56.628 --> 45:59.422
- What's going on?
- Okay, I'll be there in about 20 minutes.

45:59.506 --> 46:00.423
- Okay.
- Okay.

46:00.507 --> 46:01.966
- Bye.
- Bye.

46:06.013 --> 46:07.388
How long you got?

46:07.473 --> 46:09.348
Patience.

46:18.066 --> 46:21.027
We'll just try again.

46:22.488 --> 46:24.405
Try again.

46:28.577 --> 46:30.953
You know,
sometimes these things can be wrong.

46:36.001 --> 46:38.669
That's okay. I gotta go, okay? Bye, babe.

46:41.215 --> 46:43.424
Susan, we got the subway thing today.

46:43.509 --> 46:46.969
Yeah, I know. I'm just gonna have to
meet you there when I'm done.

46:47.054 --> 46:49.013
Wait.

46:50.182 --> 46:52.350
When you're done from what?

47:15.457 --> 47:18.584
Boots, toys, beer bottles...

47:18.669 --> 47:22.380
body parts, cocaine-filled condoms...

47:22.464 --> 47:24.674
little baby alligators.

47:24.758 --> 47:27.677
Shit, you wouldn't believe
the stuff I'd seen.

47:27.761 --> 47:29.846
Yep.

47:29.930 --> 47:33.307
They flush 'em down. We fish 'em out.

47:34.059 --> 47:37.019
But this thing.
We didn't know what this was.

47:37.104 --> 47:39.897
We were thinking about throwing it away,
but then I remembered Remy.

47:39.982 --> 47:41.691
Jeremy plays bass in my band.

47:44.278 --> 47:46.070
Anyway. So--

47:54.162 --> 47:56.622
Yep. I remember Remy says to me...

47:56.707 --> 47:59.917
"If it's got more than four legs,
it's not a mammal. "

48:01.962 --> 48:04.255
It's a lobster, right?

48:33.076 --> 48:36.662
My father saw me stay in bed...

48:36.747 --> 48:41.250
he'd go get the pitcher
of cold water, and whoosh!

48:43.879 --> 48:46.881
I tell you, that's some alarm clock.

49:07.903 --> 49:09.820
Wow.

49:12.866 --> 49:15.743
- How big did you say these bugs are?
- Come on. Hurry up.

49:15.827 --> 49:18.371
You know, my shift's almost over.
I need my beauty sleep.

49:18.455 --> 49:21.999
Man, if I'm blowing off my Saturday,
then so are you.

49:22.084 --> 49:24.585
Yeah. It looks like somebody
requested you for overtime.

49:26.755 --> 49:29.882
Come on. Hurry up.
Let's find these things.

49:29.967 --> 49:32.843
We've got a long way to go.

49:40.143 --> 49:42.186
All right. Watch your step there.

49:42.270 --> 49:45.231
We've got burrows going
down seven stories here.

49:45.315 --> 49:47.692
- No shit?
- Oh, yeah.

49:47.776 --> 49:50.319
It's five stories down, partner.

49:50.404 --> 49:52.738
You fall, I don't wanna
come back and pick you up.

49:52.823 --> 49:56.867
Okay, it's all yours. Go ahead.

50:00.831 --> 50:03.249
- It's 48 hours anyway.
- I can't wait that long.

50:03.333 --> 50:05.543
It's 48 hours. Now listen,
you got something to write with?

50:05.627 --> 50:08.295
- Yes, yes. I write it.
- You gotta write this down.

50:08.380 --> 50:10.297
Come on. Here's the case number.
It's two-seven--

50:10.382 --> 50:12.967
Wait a sec. Two, seven. Yes, two-seven--

50:13.051 --> 50:15.636
- Eight-three.
- Eight-three.

50:15.721 --> 50:19.140
- All right. You got that?
- What does this mean, case number?

50:19.224 --> 50:22.977
It means I deal with you
in 48 hours, okay?

50:44.958 --> 50:47.418
Mr. Funny Shoes.

51:50.440 --> 51:52.900
People actually do live down here?

51:52.984 --> 51:55.236
Yeah, man. The mole people.

51:55.320 --> 51:58.239
This section was pretty popular
all the way to Fulton Street.

51:58.323 --> 52:02.618
Tweeked-out crackheads,
dopeheads, shitheads, mental cases.

52:02.702 --> 52:05.162
Then suddenly, poof! All gone.

52:05.247 --> 52:08.499
Rumors got started.
Someone found a couple of stiffs.

52:08.583 --> 52:11.335
They make up
some crap about a killer.

52:11.419 --> 52:13.337
Overcoat Slim, Long John.

52:15.006 --> 52:17.466
Now, down here is the land of talk.

52:19.177 --> 52:21.178
The wildest version goes the farthest.

52:21.263 --> 52:24.348
This is mole speak, man. Hobo language.

52:24.432 --> 52:26.225
Most of'em, they can't read or write.

52:26.309 --> 52:30.646
They mark out an area with a sign or
drawing, and it's as good as closed.

52:30.730 --> 52:32.815
Here, here. See? This one.

52:32.899 --> 52:34.859
This one says, "Go away.

52:36.319 --> 52:39.155
Man with gun. " That's me.

52:46.079 --> 52:48.664
- Yeah?
- Hey, it's me again.

52:48.748 --> 52:50.958
- Susan?
- Yeah.

52:51.042 --> 52:52.376
- Hey, Susan.
- Peter?

52:52.460 --> 52:55.129
Yeah. Susan?

52:55.213 --> 52:57.214
- Can you hear me?
- Barely.

52:57.299 --> 52:59.216
I haven't found a thing yet.

52:59.301 --> 53:02.595
Okay, I have. I have to talk to you
right away in person.

53:03.805 --> 53:05.723
How long would it take
to get back to the platform?

53:05.807 --> 53:09.059
About 30 minutes,
you knock off the sightseeing.

53:09.144 --> 53:10.227
Susan--

53:10.312 --> 53:13.898
I'll meet you at the platform
at a quarter to 12:00.

53:13.982 --> 53:15.441
Honey, did you say quarter to 12:00?

53:17.235 --> 53:18.235
Peter?

53:19.362 --> 53:21.906
Susan, the test was positive.

53:21.990 --> 53:23.949
- The test was positive.
- Peter?

53:24.034 --> 53:27.703
Peter, I can't hear you!
Oh, damn it.

53:27.787 --> 53:30.456
The test was...

53:30.540 --> 53:34.293
Susan! Shit. Susan?

53:42.844 --> 53:45.262
She didn't wait long enough.

54:53.164 --> 54:56.834
Hi, Doc. Susan sent you some homework.

55:10.432 --> 55:12.141
I see--

55:13.018 --> 55:15.311
What's this? Look!

55:15.395 --> 55:18.647
The organs are... perfectly formed.

55:23.236 --> 55:25.654
They were functional.

55:25.739 --> 55:29.283
I'm guessing here, and, of course...

55:29.367 --> 55:33.746
they don't have
a complete specimen, but--

55:33.830 --> 55:35.706
What do you think it is?

55:35.790 --> 55:40.627
This thing...
is not just some random mutation.

55:40.712 --> 55:44.757
It's a highly evolved soldier caste...

55:44.841 --> 55:47.134
formidable killer.

55:47.218 --> 55:50.387
It couldn't have developed in a vacuum.

55:52.223 --> 55:54.391
It's part of a colony.

56:15.205 --> 56:17.414
This way, this way.

56:17.499 --> 56:19.416
Should have stayed at the office.

56:19.501 --> 56:22.002
- How much longer do we have to go?
- Keep looking around.

56:22.087 --> 56:24.046
It's the size of your palm.

56:25.256 --> 56:27.674
Man. Take a whiff.

56:27.759 --> 56:31.470
- God, it smells like acid.
- No. It's ammonia.

56:39.687 --> 56:41.605
Hey, guys.

56:46.111 --> 56:49.113
There's some weird shit here.

56:49.197 --> 56:51.615
What kind of weird shit?

56:54.327 --> 56:56.286
Lots of it.

56:58.123 --> 57:00.082
Oh, Jesus.

57:08.967 --> 57:12.094
God!

57:13.388 --> 57:15.305
Man!

57:17.475 --> 57:20.227
Go ahead and ask him. Ask.

57:23.690 --> 57:26.525
You seen anything like this before?

57:26.609 --> 57:29.945
Why're you asking me if I've ever seen
some shit like this before?

57:30.029 --> 57:32.573
Do I look like I've seen
some shit like this before?

57:32.657 --> 57:35.576
Hell, no, I ain't never seen
no shit like this before!

57:35.660 --> 57:39.913
Who the fuck would wanna climb up
these walls and hang one of these?

57:39.998 --> 57:43.667
Must've been a big elephant-ass
motherfucker. I don't know who the fuck...

57:45.003 --> 57:47.588
The Delancey Street station
will be closing in five minutes.

57:47.672 --> 57:50.632
Please find alternate routes
to your destination.

57:56.598 --> 57:59.850
- Carlito?
- Yeah?

58:50.109 --> 58:52.069
Oh, come on, Peter. Hurry up.

59:34.028 --> 59:37.447
Do you have the time?

59:39.450 --> 59:41.368
Sir, the time?

01:00:16.487 --> 01:00:20.407
You know, my father always
wanted me to become a dentist.

01:00:20.491 --> 01:00:22.576
I said, "No way.

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:26.997
I'm not gonna spend my life
looking into people's open mouths. "

01:00:27.081 --> 01:00:30.542
What could be worse than that, right?

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:33.837
Oh, man, I've never been this deep.

01:00:33.921 --> 01:00:36.173
This is the old Armory Station.

01:00:37.759 --> 01:00:39.718
Hey, they built it
around the turn of the century.

01:00:39.802 --> 01:00:42.095
It's been closed for decades.

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:45.057
- Yeah, I guess we covered everything.
- Hey, look.

01:00:46.684 --> 01:00:48.393
You got your shit. I'm happy for you.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:50.771
Let's get the hell outta here, huh?

01:00:50.855 --> 01:00:53.273
Okay, Josh, I want a full team
in here by 6:00 tonight.

01:00:53.358 --> 01:00:55.317
All right.

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:57.194
Oh, shit!

01:00:57.278 --> 01:01:00.197
- What the fuck?
- No, don't!

01:01:01.574 --> 01:01:03.575
Look what the fuck you did, man!

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:06.244
You see the size of that thing?

01:01:30.645 --> 01:01:32.562
Peter, are you all right?

01:01:32.647 --> 01:01:34.773
It's okay, Josh.

01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:37.776
It's okay. I think I'm okay.

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:43.782
- Get the hell off me.
- Yeah, I think he's okay too.

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:45.909
How am I gonna get you back up?

01:01:45.993 --> 01:01:48.078
I don't know.

01:01:49.205 --> 01:01:51.123
See a way up?

01:01:51.207 --> 01:01:53.125
- No.
- Shit.

01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:55.961
There is no way up.

01:02:02.427 --> 01:02:06.221
- Oh, man, that's gonna work!
- Do you know a better way up?

01:02:06.973 --> 01:02:08.890
Hey...

01:02:08.975 --> 01:02:11.893
show that to the station manager.

01:02:11.978 --> 01:02:14.521
Tell him Leonard said
he's gonna have his bubble-butt...

01:02:14.605 --> 01:02:16.481
if he don't have someone down here
in ten--

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:18.775
Wait a second.
I can't find my way back alone.

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:21.903
Look, look, look.
Just go back the same way we came.

01:02:21.988 --> 01:02:23.488
Wait, wait.

01:02:26.075 --> 01:02:28.201
- All right.
- Take the first tunnel to the left.

01:02:28.286 --> 01:02:29.995
Then go to the fourth, right?
Then right, right, left, right?

01:02:30.079 --> 01:02:34.332
Left, fourth-- Peter, can I just
stay here and help you guys back up?

01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:38.211
Toss the glow-sticks down
and just go, Josh, please.

01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:39.796
Just keep headin' up.
You're gonna get there.

01:02:39.881 --> 01:02:42.591
- Hurry!
- All right, all right! I got it.

01:05:25.796 --> 01:05:27.964
Help me!

01:05:28.049 --> 01:05:31.760
Help! Please, help!

01:05:31.844 --> 01:05:34.763
Help! Please!

01:05:34.847 --> 01:05:37.474
Help!

01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:43.563
Please! Please! Somebody, please help me!

01:10:10.497 --> 01:10:13.791
There were four brothers

01:10:16.754 --> 01:10:19.714
Piece of shit.

01:10:19.798 --> 01:10:21.716
This is really weird.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:24.177
We should've seen some
track bunnies by now.

01:10:24.261 --> 01:10:28.139
- What are they?
- Track bunnies. Rats.

01:10:28.224 --> 01:10:30.391
They're usually around.

01:10:30.476 --> 01:10:33.186
- They big?
- You damn right.

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:40.443
Yeah, yeah
Got a telegram this mornin'

01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:44.072
Sayin' my wife was dead

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:47.533
Show it to Mr. Moore
He said, Might as you know, boy

01:10:47.618 --> 01:10:50.078
You gotta plow ol' Red

01:10:50.162 --> 01:10:53.706
That white man says,
"It's rainin' and I'm way behind

01:10:55.542 --> 01:11:00.255
I may let you bury that woman, Sam
one of these old dinner times"

01:11:00.339 --> 01:11:04.217
I told him, "No, Mr. Moore"

01:11:04.301 --> 01:11:06.636
I dropped what I was doin'

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:10.765
Whoa, I cried
till my eyes was red

01:11:10.849 --> 01:11:13.935
You know I love that woman

01:11:14.019 --> 01:11:16.312
And now she's gone

01:11:16.397 --> 01:11:19.649
Could you just knock it off, please?
Knock it off.

01:11:19.733 --> 01:11:22.402
- Hey, I sing when I'm nervous.
- Yeah.

01:11:22.486 --> 01:11:24.696
Turn these lights back on.

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:28.616
- What?
- You said the cables are still alive.

01:11:28.701 --> 01:11:31.119
- Oh, man.
- Maybe we can rewire them.

01:11:31.203 --> 01:11:33.246
There you go again.

01:11:33.330 --> 01:11:36.249
- What?
- How are you gonna rewire all of this?

01:11:36.333 --> 01:11:40.086
- You need a whole crew down here to do that.
- What is your problem, man?

01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:43.464
- Do you need a memo every time you take a shit?
- Oh, don't go there.

01:11:45.592 --> 01:11:48.803
You better be careful
how you speak to people.

01:12:00.858 --> 01:12:03.318
Josh?

01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:06.696
He wouldn't be comin' from there.

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:17.290
Manny, what the hell are you doin' here?

01:12:17.374 --> 01:12:19.083
Hurry.

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:22.045
The lady needs help.

01:12:25.674 --> 01:12:28.217
Hey, honey, we're coming!

01:12:28.302 --> 01:12:30.553
Oh, Jesus, please hurry.

01:12:30.637 --> 01:12:32.889
Please. Come on!

01:12:52.951 --> 01:12:55.787
Oh, no! It's coming!

01:12:55.871 --> 01:12:58.831
What the fuck is that?
Come on. Get her, man!

01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:01.959
Get her! What the fuck is that?

01:13:02.044 --> 01:13:04.712
- What the fuck...
- Go!

01:13:12.096 --> 01:13:15.390
Look there! There! There!
The car! The car!

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:25.108
Close the door!
Close the fuckin' door!

01:13:46.547 --> 01:13:50.299
What the fuck was that?

01:13:59.351 --> 01:14:02.603
- Come on. Here. Here, here, here!
- Just wait a minute!

01:14:02.688 --> 01:14:04.355
Fuck it! You wait a minute!
I wanna make sure!

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:05.273
It's not dead.

01:14:05.357 --> 01:14:08.151
Yeah, well, it's gonna be!
Very soon, lady!

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:33.509
- There it is.
- Drag it out.

01:14:33.594 --> 01:14:35.678
- There it is!
- Drag it out!

01:14:55.073 --> 01:14:57.617
You better tell me...

01:14:57.701 --> 01:15:00.745
what the hell's goin' on around here.

01:15:13.383 --> 01:15:15.676
Oh, man.

01:15:20.891 --> 01:15:23.809
Okay, Leonard. Okay.

01:15:23.894 --> 01:15:27.188
It's gonna be fine. You'll be fine.

01:15:27.272 --> 01:15:29.982
Okay.

01:15:30.067 --> 01:15:32.401
You just stay calm.

01:15:32.486 --> 01:15:34.403
Okay, there we go.

01:15:35.572 --> 01:15:37.406
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:15:37.491 --> 01:15:40.076
Oh, Christ.

01:15:44.665 --> 01:15:48.668
- Josh will be here soon. He'll bring us some help.
- You're dreamin', man.

01:15:48.752 --> 01:15:51.045
If your boy was comin' back,
he'd have been here by now.

01:15:51.129 --> 01:15:53.673
- They got his ass, man. They ate his ass, man.
- We don't know that.

01:15:53.757 --> 01:15:55.925
And if you think there's not
another one of those things out there...

01:15:56.009 --> 01:15:58.719
what has been puttin'
that shit all over the walls?

01:15:58.804 --> 01:16:01.806
Listen, Leonard.
If you keep on screaming like that...

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:05.309
we're gonna meet the rest of its family.

01:16:07.187 --> 01:16:09.480
Manny? Manny, be careful.

01:16:09.565 --> 01:16:11.607
- It-It's dead.
- No, no, no.

01:16:11.692 --> 01:16:13.943
I emptied two clips
into that thing and it kept comin'.

01:16:14.027 --> 01:16:17.530
Wait, wait a second. Help me turn it over.

01:16:20.784 --> 01:16:22.702
Peter, these are lungs.

01:16:22.786 --> 01:16:25.997
What the hell is she talkin' about?

01:16:27.332 --> 01:16:31.085
Biology 101. You know,
insects don't have lungs.

01:16:31.169 --> 01:16:35.047
- That's what limits their size.
- The secretions are the same.

01:16:35.132 --> 01:16:37.341
Oh, God.

01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:41.887
When I increased the Judas’s metabolism, I
must have sped up its breeding cycle.

01:16:41.972 --> 01:16:44.890
I mean, we're talking tens,
hundreds of thousands of generations.

01:16:44.975 --> 01:16:47.893
- I mean, who knows how many mutations.
- Listen, l--

01:16:47.978 --> 01:16:50.605
I just don't fuckin' get this.
How could the--

01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:53.524
How could the Judas evolve into this?

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:56.986
Think generations, not years, okay?

01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:59.655
It took only 40,000 generations
for apes to turn into humans.

01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:01.240
So?

01:17:01.325 --> 01:17:04.910
We changed its DNA, Peter.
I mean, we don't know what we did!

01:17:04.995 --> 01:17:07.246
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Wait a minute! Hold on!

01:17:07.331 --> 01:17:11.626
If that thing has been around, how come--
How come nobody's ever seen it?

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:14.462
I think we have.

01:17:22.929 --> 01:17:26.432
Sometimes an insect will evolve
to mimic its predator.

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:32.021
A fly can look like a spider.

01:17:33.065 --> 01:17:35.691
A caterpillar can look like a snake.

01:17:37.694 --> 01:17:40.780
The Judas evolved to mimic its predator.

01:17:45.035 --> 01:17:46.994
Us.

01:17:48.205 --> 01:17:50.289
Nobody up there knows about this?

01:17:50.374 --> 01:17:54.377
Nobody would. Not until it's too late.

01:17:54.461 --> 01:17:56.504
These things can imitate us.

01:17:56.588 --> 01:17:59.840
They can infiltrate us and breed a legion
before anyone would even notice.

01:17:59.925 --> 01:18:05.554
How could you do this?

01:18:07.057 --> 01:18:09.600
You take something
and you make it like a man.

01:18:09.685 --> 01:18:12.103
- A man who's not a man, he's a--
- Manny!

01:18:12.187 --> 01:18:14.897
- He's a thing!
- Manny!

01:18:14.981 --> 01:18:16.482
That steals my child!

01:18:16.566 --> 01:18:19.318
Manny, you tell her,
'cause she don't give a goddamn.

01:18:19.403 --> 01:18:21.696
- Your kid's gone.
- Hey, shut up.

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:24.323
- My leg's chewed to the bone!
- Shut up, will ya? Shut the fuck up!

01:18:24.408 --> 01:18:26.742
- And they're both talkin' about insects with lungs!
- Shut up!

01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:34.750
Oh, shit! They're everywhere!

01:18:37.713 --> 01:18:40.923
Manny, get over here!

01:18:56.022 --> 01:18:58.607
It's the blood!

01:18:59.401 --> 01:19:02.445
- The smell of the blood is driving them crazy!
- Oh, shit!

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:06.741
We have to cover the scent!

01:19:06.825 --> 01:19:09.243
Manny, give me your razor.
Give me your razor!

01:19:23.467 --> 01:19:26.719
Here. Take it. Rub it on the windows.

01:19:26.803 --> 01:19:28.262
- Anywhere where there's a crack.
- Wha--

01:19:28.346 --> 01:19:30.890
- Just do it!
- Come on!

01:19:37.856 --> 01:19:38.856
What the... What is it?

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:41.942
Scent glands. Insects use them
to identify themselves.

01:19:42.027 --> 01:19:44.028
Here. Rub it all over yourself.

01:19:44.112 --> 01:19:46.906
They won't attack you
if they think you’re one of them.

01:19:48.408 --> 01:19:50.826
Me!

01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:23.025
It worked.

01:20:33.537 --> 01:20:35.496
Do you mind if...

01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:37.081
Go ahead.

01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:40.209
Manny, give me your lighter.

01:20:41.253 --> 01:20:43.879
Look. This is where we are.

01:20:45.131 --> 01:20:47.258
Now, these tunnels
may lead to the surface.

01:20:47.342 --> 01:20:49.552
- Yes.
- If we can get...

01:20:49.636 --> 01:20:53.180
this car moving,
we might be able to make it.

01:20:53.265 --> 01:20:54.807
What--

01:20:54.891 --> 01:20:57.017
What do you mean, might?

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:01.647
I mean, probably.

01:21:01.731 --> 01:21:03.524
But even if they do...

01:21:03.608 --> 01:21:08.153
this thing's been down here
rotting for half a century.

01:21:08.238 --> 01:21:10.698
- How do you know it'll move?
- Listen to me. Listen.

01:21:12.325 --> 01:21:16.161
This car is a CR-17 from Coney Island.

01:21:16.246 --> 01:21:19.206
Believe me, it was made to last.

01:21:20.667 --> 01:21:22.668
Now, Manny...

01:21:22.752 --> 01:21:26.755
there's a track relay switch
in this room here.

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:29.925
- You switch the tracks. That'll get us going.
- Yes, I'll try.

01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:31.802
- I'll try.
- Do.

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:33.637
There's a fuse box down the tracks.

01:21:33.722 --> 01:21:37.182
If I can rewire it,
I can juice up the whole system.

01:21:37.267 --> 01:21:39.143
Leonard, man.

01:21:39.227 --> 01:21:42.062
- Look at yourself, l--
- I'll do it.

01:21:42.147 --> 01:21:44.982
Hey, if you talk me through it,
I'll go out there.

01:21:45.066 --> 01:21:47.651
- All you've gotta do is...
- No, no, no, no. I'll go.

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:50.195
- I'll go.
- Why?

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:53.949
I know much more about
what's out there than you do.

01:22:00.081 --> 01:22:02.791
You're right.

01:22:02.876 --> 01:22:05.836
You understand the creature, and...

01:22:07.505 --> 01:22:10.633
Leonard knows the subway, so--

01:22:12.385 --> 01:22:14.637
so this is the way it's gotta be.

01:22:14.721 --> 01:22:17.348
- Whatever happens, it's Manny and me.
- Why?

01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:20.392
You two have gotta stay on this car.

01:22:21.561 --> 01:22:24.521
You gotta get back up.

01:22:26.107 --> 01:22:28.359
You gotta undo this.

01:22:30.153 --> 01:22:32.112
So, I'll go.

01:22:33.448 --> 01:22:35.324
We'll go.

01:22:35.408 --> 01:22:37.326
Yes.

01:23:00.308 --> 01:23:02.726
I have to put this on you now.

01:23:10.777 --> 01:23:13.028
They mimic us. We mimic them.

01:23:18.952 --> 01:23:22.371
Peter, Peter. Peter, look.

01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:26.542
You'll find two wires...

01:23:26.626 --> 01:23:29.169
one green, the other blue.

01:23:31.881 --> 01:23:33.549
Okay.

01:23:34.718 --> 01:23:37.886
Man, this shit can't be sanitary.

01:23:37.971 --> 01:23:40.014
Take it off.

01:23:40.098 --> 01:23:43.017
No, man. Leave it on. Leave it on.

01:24:02.954 --> 01:24:05.706
Don't touch it.

01:24:05.790 --> 01:24:08.125
Try not to sweat.

01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:10.627
They sense chemical changes.

01:24:12.088 --> 01:24:14.089
Oh, okay.

01:24:15.717 --> 01:24:18.302
Okay, I'll try not to sweat.

01:25:33.419 --> 01:25:35.838
Susan, he's in.

01:25:35.922 --> 01:25:38.173
He just needs to find the switch.

01:25:39.050 --> 01:25:41.009
Good.

01:26:13.877 --> 01:26:15.919
Green. Blue.

01:26:16.004 --> 01:26:18.255
Green, blue. Green, blue.

01:26:29.309 --> 01:26:31.226
Shit.

01:27:24.447 --> 01:27:28.492
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh--

01:27:29.535 --> 01:27:32.329
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:27:33.706 --> 01:27:36.124
Oh, shit.

01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:11.576
Chuy, it's me.

01:28:11.661 --> 01:28:15.080
Come on, Manny. What's takin' you so long?

01:28:15.164 --> 01:28:18.041
Do these subway tracks
lead to the regular train tunnels...

01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:21.086
at Grand Central and Penn Station?

01:28:21.170 --> 01:28:23.714
Yeah, yeah.

01:28:23.798 --> 01:28:26.883
Well, they'll use them
to migrate out of the city.

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:30.929
After that, they'll set up
colonies anywhere they can.

01:28:33.474 --> 01:28:34.808
Fuck.

01:28:38.021 --> 01:28:40.439
Now, every specimen
we've seen has been female...

01:28:40.523 --> 01:28:43.900
because a male would be a lighter 
color and it would have no wings.

01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:46.987
And if they are holding true
to the Judas’s spawning pattern...

01:28:47.071 --> 01:28:50.824
the nest will have only one fertile male.

01:28:50.908 --> 01:28:54.995
Now, if we could catch
that male and kill him...

01:28:55.079 --> 01:28:57.789
then the females won't be able to breed...

01:28:57.874 --> 01:29:00.334
and the whole generation could die out.

01:29:02.378 --> 01:29:04.421
Where the hell is the male?

01:29:07.508 --> 01:29:10.761
Chuy, come here.

01:29:10.845 --> 01:29:13.305
Come here. Come here.

01:29:15.933 --> 01:29:17.809
Friends.

01:29:17.894 --> 01:29:20.395
Come here, please.

01:29:37.538 --> 01:29:40.457
Oh, goddamn it! He must be in trouble!

01:29:42.335 --> 01:29:45.253
- He must be in trouble!
- Wait. Listen.

01:29:49.008 --> 01:29:52.177
- Oh, Jesus!
- I'm goin' out there.

01:29:54.430 --> 01:29:56.515
You stay here.

01:29:56.599 --> 01:29:59.434
Listen. If the car starts...

01:29:59.519 --> 01:30:02.979
I'll meet you at the end of the platform.

01:30:33.511 --> 01:30:35.929
Oh, my God.

01:30:48.151 --> 01:30:50.110
Oh, Manny.

01:31:31.736 --> 01:31:35.238
Yes! Yes! CR-17 from Coney Island!
Goddamn it!

01:31:57.845 --> 01:32:01.097
Oh, shit! Goddamn it!

01:32:07.063 --> 01:32:09.731
Goddamn! Shit!

01:32:22.036 --> 01:32:24.996
Leonard!

01:32:27.083 --> 01:32:29.876
Get away! Go away! I'm bleeding!

01:32:29.961 --> 01:32:32.295
- Found a way out, on a dumbwaiter.
- Go away!

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.297
Peter, I'm bleeding. Go away!

01:32:34.382 --> 01:32:36.258
I can't stop it.

01:32:36.342 --> 01:32:40.262
- I can't stop it. They'll be here soon.
- Where's my wife?

01:32:40.346 --> 01:32:43.098
- Go away.
- Where's Susan?

01:32:43.182 --> 01:32:45.433
- Where's Susan?
- She went to get Manny.

01:33:00.783 --> 01:33:04.286
They haven't seen us yet. Don't move.

01:33:13.629 --> 01:33:16.047
Peter, go!

01:33:33.899 --> 01:33:37.861
- At an old general station
- Oh, my God.

01:33:39.739 --> 01:33:43.325
Please send a train

01:33:43.409 --> 01:33:45.493
Leonard?

01:33:46.829 --> 01:33:51.333
You see
My health is failin' me

01:33:52.418 --> 01:33:56.046
And I ain't got too much time

01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:33.958
- Come on, Chuy.
- Hurry!

01:34:34.043 --> 01:34:36.586
All right, come on in.
That's all right. That's a good boy.

01:34:36.671 --> 01:34:39.381
No, no, it's all right.
Stop. Stop it.

01:34:39.465 --> 01:34:41.466
It's okay. It's okay. All right, Peter.

01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:44.886
Come on. Get in. Get in, Peter.
Come on. Chuy, shh! Stop it!

01:34:44.970 --> 01:34:46.888
Stop it!

01:34:52.978 --> 01:34:55.313
Get in, get in, get in.

01:34:55.398 --> 01:34:59.359
- Peter, what are you doing?
- I gotta stop them here.

01:34:59.443 --> 01:35:01.820
Oh, no. Peter, don't do this!

01:35:01.904 --> 01:35:04.447
Peter! No! No!

01:35:04.532 --> 01:35:07.200
Oh, Jesus! Don't! No!

01:35:07.284 --> 01:35:09.744
Chuy! Chuy! Stop it. Stop it.

01:35:19.130 --> 01:35:20.672
Train!

01:35:20.756 --> 01:35:24.259
We're here! Help!

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:35.729
Oh, Jesus.

01:36:09.346 --> 01:36:12.474
Go on, Chuy. Go on.

01:36:12.558 --> 01:36:15.643
Get out! Hurry! Go!

01:36:51.597 --> 01:36:53.556
Fuck you!

01:39:41.225 --> 01:39:43.726
Look out!

01:40:53.505 --> 01:40:55.715
Oh, my God.

01:40:55.799 --> 01:40:57.759
It's the male.

01:41:02.765 --> 01:41:04.265
No!

01:41:04.349 --> 01:41:09.103
You will not hurt him! No! Turn around!

01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:13.316
Turn around!

01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:51.354
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:43:14.771 --> 01:43:17.190
Police and emergency crews
continue their work...

01:43:17.274 --> 01:43:21.194
in the aftermath of tonight’s explosions
on the Lower East Side.

01:43:24.239 --> 01:43:26.991
Hustle up! Teams leader!

01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:53.142
We swept the area twice.

01:43:53.227 --> 01:43:55.519
It's burned.

01:43:55.604 --> 01:43:58.439
Nothing could have survived down there.

01:43:59.524 --> 01:44:02.068
What about one of us?

01:44:11.119 --> 01:44:13.162
I'm sorry, Susan.

01:44:14.998 --> 01:44:16.999
I really am.

01:44:31.807 --> 01:44:33.766
Shiny wire.

01:45:16.143 --> 01:45:19.186
Mountain boots. Ten.

01:45:19.271 --> 01:45:20.771
Brown.

01:46:06.234 --> 01:46:09.862
We're gonna have a baby.
We're gonna have a baby.
