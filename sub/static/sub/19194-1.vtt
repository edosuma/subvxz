WEBVTT

00:32.223 --> 00:34.459
You got the right idea.

00:34.559 --> 00:37.930
- Oh, yes, back to work.
- Hey, there's the man of the hour.

00:38.030 --> 00:39.598
- Happy birthday, man.
- Thank you.

00:39.698 --> 00:41.667
How you feeling?
Feeling older? Feeling wiser?

00:41.767 --> 00:44.509
Well, it all blends together
after a little while.

00:50.175 --> 00:51.944
I wouldn't touch that.

00:52.044 --> 00:54.611
I'm gonna eat all of it.
That's what's gonna happen.

00:59.150 --> 01:00.886
See that?

01:00.986 --> 01:03.054
Come here real quick.

01:03.154 --> 01:06.189
Glen, can you bring up visual
on the shaft real quick, please?

01:10.895 --> 01:12.931
Visual's coming up now.

01:13.831 --> 01:15.200
How far down are we?

01:15.300 --> 01:19.071
We are passing
the 1,000-foot marker... now.

01:20.171 --> 01:22.205
Let's take it further.

01:36.987 --> 01:40.526
- Can we pick up the drop please?
- Yeah, speed that up.

01:40.826 --> 01:42.859
3,000 feet.

01:52.969 --> 01:54.770
What was that?

01:57.007 --> 01:59.042
You seeing that?

02:00.778 --> 02:04.738
Wait, can you rewind that,
take it back? Sasha!

02:07.317 --> 02:09.118
What the...

02:13.423 --> 02:16.014
- That's C-shaft, isn't it?
- Yeah.

02:16.894 --> 02:18.263
All right.

02:18.363 --> 02:20.997
- Be safe.
- Yeah.

02:22.032 --> 02:24.033
Bring that back up.

02:37.581 --> 02:39.315
Sasha!

02:56.016 --> 02:57.650
Bill!

02:58.452 --> 03:00.319
What's going on?

03:04.144 --> 03:06.025
Oh, God!

03:40.581 --> 03:43.213
<i>We got a war going on down here.</i>

03:50.754 --> 03:53.737
<i>A global assault on a scale
the world has never seen.</i>

03:53.837 --> 03:56.934
<i>We have reports that these
invading creatures are terrestrial</i>

03:57.034 --> 03:59.162
<i>and of subterranean origin.</i>

04:01.265 --> 04:05.103
<i>The world's military forces are making
no gains against these masses</i>

04:05.203 --> 04:08.580
<i>and are heavily outnumbered by what
some are calling "demon hordes."</i>

04:08.680 --> 04:12.209
<i>Reports of mass migrations and the beaching
of thousands of marine animals</i>

04:12.309 --> 04:16.414
<i>along the European coastline
appear to be precursors to the eclipse.</i>

04:16.514 --> 04:19.750
<i>If we're still on the air,
stay in your homes.</i>

04:19.851 --> 04:23.421
<i>Take shelter. Our nation is under attack.</i>

04:23.521 --> 04:26.257
<i>Similar events are happening
all over the world.</i>

04:26.357 --> 04:30.027
<i>We want to repeat, take shelter now.</i>

04:30.127 --> 04:33.965
<i>After 24 horrific hours
and a second eclipse,</i>

04:34.065 --> 04:38.539
<i>the world needs to recover.
No one knows what this means for us.</i>

04:40.905 --> 04:45.443
<i>The president has proposed the creation
of a new department of homeland security.</i>

04:45.543 --> 04:50.282
<i>The DHS, which will ensure the preparedness
of our nation in the months and years ahead.</i>

04:50.382 --> 04:54.152
<i>Military installations now circle
the globe and all deep-core fissures.</i>

04:54.252 --> 04:59.791
<i>These facilities, known as "gates," stand guard
against the dire possibility of another event.</i>

04:59.891 --> 05:04.161
<i>That harrowing 24 hours of terror
known as the "Day of Reckoning."</i>

05:37.111 --> 05:39.000
There you are, buddy.

05:39.530 --> 05:41.767
Not doing so well, are you?

05:42.767 --> 05:45.003
Seen better days.

05:45.803 --> 05:49.174
You and me both. Come here, little man.

05:49.274 --> 05:52.141
I know. This sucks.

05:54.145 --> 05:57.954
Sorry, little buddy. Time to go home.

06:05.990 --> 06:09.594
All right, we got it. Bagged and tagged.

06:10.894 --> 06:13.331
- What do we got?
- Next time, I think you should go in.

06:13.431 --> 06:15.467
Goddamn!

06:16.367 --> 06:20.038
- Is it still alive?
- No. Too many jellybeans, I think.

06:20.138 --> 06:21.739
Poor little guy never had a chance.

06:21.839 --> 06:24.909
That asbestos thing, by the way,
hasn't gone away yet.

06:25.009 --> 06:27.042
That's next on my list.

06:29.279 --> 06:31.149
Boss, I'm serious. It's...

06:31.249 --> 06:33.552
- Yep.
- It's kind of a big...

06:34.252 --> 06:35.887
Yeah.

06:36.387 --> 06:38.889
No, the other way, the other way.

06:52.169 --> 06:55.637
Thanks a lot, Mr. Wilson.
Appreciate it. All right.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.766
Hi, Laura.

07:21.866 --> 07:23.734
Hi, Milton.

07:24.533 --> 07:26.794
I need to borrow your skeleton.

07:27.094 --> 07:30.773
- Sure. It's right over there.
- Thank you.

07:36.212 --> 07:37.946
I was wondering.

07:38.046 --> 07:43.022
I mean, I know your ex-husband
has your son for the weekend...

07:44.222 --> 07:48.792
and obviously you're gonna have to eat,
so I thought that you might...

07:54.298 --> 07:59.104
That's... that's very thoughtful
of you, Milton. It just...

07:59.404 --> 08:01.238
Rain check?

08:01.738 --> 08:03.973
Sure. Yeah, I understand.

08:04.875 --> 08:07.477
I'll put that check with the others.

08:15.986 --> 08:17.853
See you later.

08:19.022 --> 08:20.856
I'd love to.

08:22.692 --> 08:24.927
You would? Love to what?

08:26.697 --> 08:28.765
Have dinner.

08:29.299 --> 08:31.100
You would?

08:32.102 --> 08:35.744
Well, okay, then. No more rain checks.

08:36.774 --> 08:39.741
I will pick you up at 8:00, promptly.

08:42.379 --> 08:44.246
See ya.

09:06.803 --> 09:08.674
Here's the thing.

09:11.776 --> 09:14.011
See that girl right over there?

09:16.246 --> 09:17.849
Yeah.

09:18.849 --> 09:20.484
Stop!

09:20.737 --> 09:22.785
Go talk to her.

09:39.669 --> 09:44.539
I'm sorry, but your beautiful smile
has entirely distracted me.

09:47.844 --> 09:50.947
Okay, no make-out session
in front of your friends.

10:05.829 --> 10:08.234
You worried about the eclipse tomorrow?

10:09.584 --> 10:11.220
Yeah.

10:12.270 --> 10:15.204
I mean, they say that millions
of people died.

10:19.042 --> 10:22.180
Hey, don't worry, okay?

10:22.780 --> 10:26.984
I mean, there's been so many
eclipses since, and no monsters.

10:27.084 --> 10:28.685
Yeah.

10:31.421 --> 10:33.858
You know, I'm staying
with my dad this weekend.

10:34.958 --> 10:38.329
- Yes.
- And your parents are off to Palm Springs.

10:38.429 --> 10:41.499
- Yes.
- Well?

10:41.599 --> 10:44.201
Are you asking me out on a date?

10:44.901 --> 10:48.039
Yes, I am. I mean, as long as
you don't have other plans.

10:48.139 --> 10:49.832
Stop.

10:50.795 --> 10:53.649
- You think your dad will let you?
- Yeah.

10:54.108 --> 10:56.414
I mean, he's pretty cool.
My mom doesn't think so,

10:56.514 --> 11:00.285
but he's a lot less parental than my mom.

11:00.385 --> 11:02.221
And controlling.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.372
What happened between them?

11:06.940 --> 11:08.576
Me.

11:09.626 --> 11:11.861
Well, and the reckoning, but...

11:13.229 --> 11:16.799
I don't know. They just kinda
split up after I was born.

11:18.468 --> 11:22.774
But it's like, "what are you gonna do?",
you know? I just try not to think about it.

11:22.874 --> 11:25.475
Well, at least your parents are around.

11:45.895 --> 11:48.366
- Yeah?
- <i>We need you down here right away.</i>

11:48.466 --> 11:50.268
<i>We just went red.</i>

11:50.368 --> 11:52.437
<i>Today's there's been
major seismic activity</i>

11:52.537 --> 11:56.741
<i>below the two-mile line over the last
eight hours, and it's converging.</i>

11:56.841 --> 11:59.544
<i>The other facilities
have confirmed activity, too.</i>

11:59.644 --> 12:02.880
<i>I don't think this is a drill.
This is the real deal,</i>

12:02.980 --> 12:04.981
<i>and we are a go on containment.</i>

12:30.657 --> 12:32.325
Chief.

12:34.577 --> 12:36.981
I don't think this one's a drill.

12:37.081 --> 12:39.083
I don't know, man.

12:39.183 --> 12:41.539
But we'll be ready this time.

12:43.019 --> 12:45.721
Ain't something I'm inclined
to go through again.

12:52.629 --> 12:54.898
It's all good, yeah?

12:55.398 --> 12:57.667
Honestly, I think it's broken.

13:10.180 --> 13:12.498
Hey. How's it going?

13:12.598 --> 13:15.453
Good. It's good to see you, too.

13:15.853 --> 13:18.688
- Where's your mom?
- In the kitchen.

13:21.725 --> 13:24.195
- Hey, Laura.
- Hey.

13:24.295 --> 13:27.498
Sorry I missed you last month.

13:27.598 --> 13:29.389
And the month before that.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.770
And the month before that.

13:32.870 --> 13:34.672
It's okay.

13:34.772 --> 13:36.674
You look good.

13:36.774 --> 13:40.444
You... heard about the eclipse
on Saturday, yeah?

13:40.544 --> 13:45.149
- Yeah, everyone has.
- And you'll be with him for it, right?

13:45.249 --> 13:47.519
Yeah, yeah.

13:48.419 --> 13:50.871
But I'm not looking
to have a heartfelt conversation

13:50.971 --> 13:53.725
about what happened 15 years ago,
if that's where this is going.

13:53.825 --> 13:56.994
That's not where this was going.
Why do you always do that?

13:57.094 --> 13:59.763
You always turn everything back on me.

13:59.863 --> 14:02.466
I don't do that, Laura. You do that.

14:03.066 --> 14:04.733
Really?

14:05.602 --> 14:07.839
I'm just here for our son.

14:08.539 --> 14:10.007
- Honey?
- Yes, I am ready.

14:10.107 --> 14:14.511
I'm actually waiting on you guys
with my bag at the door. Are you done?

14:16.246 --> 14:19.484
- Do you see this? Do you see what you do?
- I know.

14:20.434 --> 14:23.304
- I love you.
- I love you, too, Mom.

14:23.404 --> 14:24.822
Have fun and be safe.

14:24.922 --> 14:28.092
I want him home Sunday evening, please.

14:28.192 --> 14:29.426
Yeah.

14:29.526 --> 14:32.128
- Can I drive?
- No.

14:53.318 --> 14:55.526
Jiminy Christmas!

14:58.089 --> 15:00.357
We lost grid 7!

15:00.457 --> 15:02.159
Oh, man!

15:02.259 --> 15:04.728
They don't pay me enough for this, man!

15:10.100 --> 15:12.589
Copy, copy.

15:32.123 --> 15:34.724
If it's Mom, I'm asleep.

15:37.427 --> 15:39.296
- Yo.
- <i>Dave?</i>

15:39.396 --> 15:42.299
<i>Dave, it's Uncle Ted.
You know what's going on?</i>

15:42.399 --> 15:45.986
- <i>You gotta listen to me very carefully.</i>
- It's like one in the morning, Ted.

15:46.086 --> 15:48.088
<i>What the hell does that matter?</i>

15:48.188 --> 15:51.192
<i>Stella sent you a map in an email.</i>

15:51.292 --> 15:53.158
It's Uncle Ted.

15:53.894 --> 15:56.497
No, no comprende.

15:56.597 --> 15:58.933
Speak slowly. Pretend like
you're talking to an idiot.

15:59.033 --> 16:02.603
<i>Apparently I am, smart ass.
I'm talking about what's happening.</i>

16:02.703 --> 16:04.972
<i>I'm talking about another event.</i>

16:05.072 --> 16:09.110
<i>You got till about midday tomorrow
to wrangle up your family</i>

16:09.210 --> 16:13.912
<i>and get your ass up here
to Barstow before the eclipse.</i>

16:15.148 --> 16:19.453
<i>What we're reporting now is a second
mass die-off in the Gulf of Mexico</i>

16:19.553 --> 16:21.589
<i>within hours of the Norway event,</i>

16:21.689 --> 16:26.427
<i>which scientists say is eerily similar to
the events preceding the Day of Reckoning.</i>

16:26.527 --> 16:27.862
Hey, Dad?

16:29.162 --> 16:31.465
Dad, you're gonna want to come see this.

16:31.565 --> 16:35.001
<i>The second sign will be a mass migration.</i>

16:35.101 --> 16:39.540
- <i>It's happening all over the world again.</i>
- <i>Fears mount for the second precursor</i>

16:39.640 --> 16:43.811
<i>that would signal another event
like the one 15 years ago.</i>

16:43.911 --> 16:47.013
- <i>The final sign...</i>
- The eclipse.

17:10.954 --> 17:14.560
<i>It's God's way.
The world has become very evil.</i>

17:14.660 --> 17:18.713
<i>This is his way of cleansing his world.
It's his world, after all. He created it.</i>

17:18.813 --> 17:20.799
<i>We were given a warning...</i>

17:20.949 --> 17:22.550
Ted?

17:23.798 --> 17:26.969
<i>David, it's Laura. Have you seen the news?</i>

17:27.669 --> 17:30.606
Yeah, of course. It's been on all night.

17:30.706 --> 17:34.643
<i>David, please. Please,
I want you to bring Tyler home.</i>

17:34.743 --> 17:38.096
- <i>Milton's made arrangements at a shelter.</i>
- Laura, you can trust me. I'm his father.

17:38.196 --> 17:40.231
He's safe here.

17:53.027 --> 17:55.677
<i>I don't trust this house.
He'll be safer with us.</i>

17:55.777 --> 17:56.932
Us?

17:57.032 --> 18:00.556
<i>That is not... that is not what I meant.
Can you not do this right now?</i>

18:00.656 --> 18:04.341
<i>This is not a joke.
I want you to bring Tyler home now!</i>

18:06.541 --> 18:10.086
Okay, yeah, you win. I'll...

18:11.746 --> 18:14.181
Yeah, I'll bring him over right now.

18:18.719 --> 18:21.523
As soon as he's done with what he's doing.

18:21.623 --> 18:24.993
- <i>What do you mean? What is he doing?</i>
- Yeah, he's working on a project right now.

18:25.093 --> 18:27.928
It's for school. I'll have him right over.

18:29.930 --> 18:33.936
What is this? "555-2674."
555-2674. 555-2674.

18:37.638 --> 18:40.028
Tyler, Tyler, Tyler, buddy.

18:40.708 --> 18:42.415
All right.

18:44.379 --> 18:46.228
Come in.

18:47.014 --> 18:49.084
Laura, everything's been
prearranged with the shelter,

18:49.184 --> 18:52.220
but we gotta get there early
before it fills up.

18:52.320 --> 18:53.955
I can't find Tyler.

18:54.055 --> 18:56.925
That's okay. We got time. Let me
show you a trick. Where's your computer?

18:57.025 --> 18:58.859
It's right there.

19:02.797 --> 19:04.664
That your phone?

19:05.900 --> 19:08.373
- That's his number?
- Yeah.

19:18.679 --> 19:21.280
- Skate park.
- Yeah.

19:23.150 --> 19:26.220
How could it happen
on such a beautiful day?

19:31.425 --> 19:34.162
- You think we'll see tomorrow?
- Don't say that.

19:34.662 --> 19:36.932
Maybe it won't even happen.

19:37.532 --> 19:41.168
And you know what? If it does, we'll hide.
A lot of people survived.

19:45.773 --> 19:47.807
Don't leave me.

19:48.909 --> 19:51.779
Not even for a mondo board with spitfires.

19:55.682 --> 19:57.286
Hey.

19:57.686 --> 19:59.975
You know, my mom, she says my dad

20:00.075 --> 20:02.933
wasn't there for her
when she needed him most.

20:04.625 --> 20:07.894
I won't do that to you. I promise.

20:11.299 --> 20:12.716
Holy crap.

20:18.905 --> 20:20.909
Look at that.

20:21.009 --> 20:23.042
It's the second sign.

20:25.113 --> 20:27.581
They're swarming everywhere!

20:31.836 --> 20:33.703
Come on.

21:02.184 --> 21:04.418
What the hell is going on?

21:11.208 --> 21:12.943
Oh, my God.

21:51.531 --> 21:55.148
Maybe I should reconfirm
our reservations at the shelter.

21:59.273 --> 22:01.109
Let's go.

22:01.209 --> 22:03.979
Yes, this is Milton Sing. S-i-n-g.

22:04.079 --> 22:06.513
I have a reservation for five.

22:50.457 --> 22:52.458
Back online.

23:10.410 --> 23:12.078
Carl!

23:29.095 --> 23:31.131
Please! Please! No!

23:59.426 --> 24:01.572
Tyler! Tyler!

24:01.672 --> 24:03.330
Dad!

24:04.798 --> 24:07.569
- I oughta wring your neck, buddy.
- I'm sorry. She had nowhere else to go.

24:07.669 --> 24:09.885
I'm so sorry, Mr. Shepherd.

24:10.385 --> 24:12.340
- Wait. What is that?
- Emergency sirens.

24:12.440 --> 24:15.277
- I didn't know we had those.
- Yeah, me neither. Come on, let's go.

24:15.877 --> 24:17.101
- Uncle Ted...
- My skateboard.

24:17.201 --> 24:19.815
We'll get it later. Uncle Ted's got
some kind of bunker in the desert.

24:19.915 --> 24:22.947
We need to get your mom and get
out of the city. Come on, this way.

24:23.047 --> 24:24.986
- Tyler!
- Hey, speak of the devil.

24:25.086 --> 24:28.257
- Tyler!
- Yeah, let's get in.

24:29.357 --> 24:33.953
All right, come on, let's get in.
Perfect timing, Laura, as always.

24:50.576 --> 24:52.714
- Hey, Milton.
- David.

24:52.814 --> 24:55.512
You know your way to Barstow?

24:55.612 --> 24:59.719
We're going to the Topanga Shelter.
I told you Milton made arrangements.

25:03.690 --> 25:06.094
We have a little over an hour, you guys.

25:06.794 --> 25:09.729
Right. An hour it is.

25:21.774 --> 25:23.879
You know your way to Topanga, Milton?

25:23.979 --> 25:26.948
Yes, I know my way to Topanga, David.

25:27.048 --> 25:30.661
- I just don't remember going this way.
- David, please.

25:34.888 --> 25:37.957
- How far?
- We're fine, we're fine.

25:41.695 --> 25:43.363
Shit.

25:51.605 --> 25:54.640
He's coming! Lucifer!

26:02.917 --> 26:05.138
Come on, come on.

26:05.238 --> 26:07.122
We're not gonna make it.

26:07.222 --> 26:10.757
- We are gonna make it.
- That's just her being positive.

26:32.753 --> 26:35.047
Repent your soul!

26:39.853 --> 26:41.688
There it is.

27:27.668 --> 27:31.973
Step back! Women and children only!
Women and children only!

27:32.073 --> 27:35.010
Step back! Women and children only!

27:35.110 --> 27:38.013
- Women and children only.
- What?

27:38.113 --> 27:40.268
Stand in this line.
Women and children only!

27:40.368 --> 27:43.652
Sir, sir, officer, this is my group.
We made arrangements.

27:43.752 --> 27:46.120
Hold on right there.
Step to the right, sir.

27:46.220 --> 27:49.390
- This is my group. We made arrangements.
- I'm sorry. The shelter's nearly full.

27:49.490 --> 27:52.660
It's women and children only.
I can't help you. I'm sorry.

27:52.760 --> 27:56.564
You're not listening to me, okay?
He called yesterday and made arrangements.

27:56.664 --> 28:00.268
Women and children only.
Women and children only!

28:00.368 --> 28:03.238
Women and children only! Back up, sir.

28:03.338 --> 28:07.207
Step to the side, sir!
Women and children only!

28:07.607 --> 28:10.045
- You take care of your mom, okay?
- No, no, I'm not leaving you.

28:10.145 --> 28:12.480
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. Go.

28:12.580 --> 28:14.555
- It's fine. Go, hurry.
- Dad, I'm not gonna...

28:14.655 --> 28:18.070
Listen to me! Take care of your mother
and get into the shelter. That's an order.

28:18.270 --> 28:20.666
You understand? Go! Go!

28:20.766 --> 28:23.408
Hey, I reinforced the house,
remember? It's fine.

28:23.508 --> 28:26.109
You got it. You got it.

28:27.061 --> 28:29.196
- It's gonna be okay.
- He'll be fine.

28:29.296 --> 28:33.167
- We gotta go.
- You can't do this! You can't separate us!

28:33.267 --> 28:37.567
- Sorry, sir. Women and children only.
- Come on, David, we gotta get out of here.

28:40.274 --> 28:42.109
Come on.

28:45.913 --> 28:48.981
- Please. Hurry up.
- Hold up, hold up.

28:50.084 --> 28:51.152
No, I'm sorry.

28:51.252 --> 28:52.931
- Tyler!
- Tyler! Tyler!

28:53.031 --> 28:56.057
- No, Tyler! Damn it!
- I'm not gonna leave you!

28:56.157 --> 28:59.962
- No! He's my dad! I'm gonna stay with him!
- Listen to me! Please come in.

29:01.162 --> 29:04.632
That's it! Shelter's full! No more people!

29:04.732 --> 29:09.157
We are at capacity!
Hey, shelter is full! No more people!

29:09.437 --> 29:11.906
- We are at capacity!
- Sir, please listen to me!

29:12.006 --> 29:14.975
I have my family here.
We made arrangements.

29:15.075 --> 29:18.046
- We are at capacity!
- Never mind! Let's go! Laura, come on!

29:18.146 --> 29:20.682
- You're not listening to me!
- Laura, let's go! Ty, go!

29:20.782 --> 29:23.351
Let's go. We gotta find shelter now.

29:23.451 --> 29:27.088
- There are women here, and children!
- Let's go. Come on, let's go.

29:27.188 --> 29:31.291
No more people! No more people! I'm sorry.

29:35.018 --> 29:37.555
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

29:38.555 --> 29:40.150
- They're not picking up?
- No.

29:40.250 --> 29:42.660
- It's going straight to voicemail.
- Yes, it's going straight to voicemail.

29:42.760 --> 29:45.796
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

29:46.196 --> 29:49.833
David, are you sure about
the house being reinforced?

29:49.933 --> 29:52.169
No, I just said that.

29:52.769 --> 29:55.423
Breathe, Laura. We can still make
a run for Ted's place in the desert.

29:55.523 --> 29:57.208
The desert? Are you kidding me?
We'll never make it.

29:57.308 --> 29:59.952
We'll take the back roads, avoid
the highway. We'll be out of the city.

30:00.052 --> 30:02.030
We have ten minutes.
We have to find somewhere now.

30:02.130 --> 30:05.749
I know where we're going. We're gonna go
to the school. It's only a few minutes away.

30:05.849 --> 30:07.852
- We have a secure basement.
- That place will be mobbed by now.

30:07.952 --> 30:11.489
That basement isn't secure. There's ten
different ways in, kids go in there to make out.

30:11.589 --> 30:14.225
Young man, just trust me.
It's gonna be fine!

30:14.325 --> 30:16.794
- It's the place to go!
- The basement isn't secure!

30:16.894 --> 30:21.353
Okay, everybody, just calm down!
Just breathe and calm down.

30:24.100 --> 30:26.436
We'll be fine! It's a secure basement.

30:26.536 --> 30:29.685
- Milton.
- Is he still not picking up?

30:40.183 --> 30:42.819
- What do we do?
- It's all stopped.

30:42.919 --> 30:44.855
- Nobody's moving.
- What is going on?

30:44.955 --> 30:47.708
- What's happening?
- I can't go anywhere.

30:47.808 --> 30:50.048
We'll figure it out, guys.

31:32.034 --> 31:34.538
Laura, go see if there's a door.
Tyler, see if there's some opening.

31:34.638 --> 31:37.018
See if there's anywhere to hide.

31:38.974 --> 31:42.044
- Come on, there's a door there.
- I'll go over here.

32:12.842 --> 32:16.513
Yo, Dad! I don't know what to do!
It's locked up. I can't get in.

32:16.613 --> 32:19.517
- I know. Get in the car.
- Guys, we gotta go now!

32:19.617 --> 32:22.419
They'll tear the school apart.
We gotta get out of the city.

32:22.519 --> 32:25.289
I know the way to the L.A. River.
We can take it all the way to the dirt.

32:25.389 --> 32:27.725
- I'll drive.
- Let me drive!

32:27.825 --> 32:29.426
Hey!

32:29.526 --> 32:31.113
I got it.

32:31.794 --> 32:34.774
No! No!
You're not gonna get me killed today!

32:35.605 --> 32:37.517
This is my car!

32:38.139 --> 32:41.400
Milton! Milton! Milton!

32:44.607 --> 32:47.409
Get in the car. Get in the car.

32:48.311 --> 32:51.013
Dad, go, go! Drive, drive, drive!

32:52.331 --> 32:54.279
Oh, my God.

33:59.648 --> 34:02.686
- Anything?
- No.

34:03.486 --> 34:06.557
- Maddie, you still with us?
- Yeah.

34:07.357 --> 34:09.947
We're gonna be okay, all right? All of us.

34:10.047 --> 34:14.030
- How far is Ted's?
- Hundred miles or so.

34:15.931 --> 34:18.001
Hey, it'll get us
out of the city, all right?

34:18.101 --> 34:21.538
Do we have weapons or anything?
Does salt really kill them?

34:21.638 --> 34:23.407
Yes.

34:23.507 --> 34:25.342
And cold.

34:25.942 --> 34:28.344
Why would God do this to us?

34:28.444 --> 34:31.114
I mean, is this really a part of his plan?

34:31.214 --> 34:37.127
Honey, we're not... we're not sure
where these things come from.

34:37.226 --> 34:41.525
Nobody knows why they're here
or what they want.

34:41.625 --> 34:46.063
<i>We call them demons,
but that's just one of many theories.</i>

34:46.163 --> 34:48.732
<i>Some say it's God's will.</i>

34:49.032 --> 34:51.301
- <i>Are they here to test us?</i>
- <i>Maybe.</i>

34:51.400 --> 34:55.706
<i>Others think they've just been here
for a very, very long time,</i>

34:55.806 --> 34:58.207
<i>just hibernating.</i>

35:00.943 --> 35:02.646
Just waiting.

35:03.446 --> 35:05.647
Is that what you believe?

35:06.849 --> 35:08.938
I don't know anymore.

35:13.489 --> 35:17.227
- What? What was that?
- We need to find a new car.

35:17.327 --> 35:19.172
- What?
- How much further?

35:19.272 --> 35:21.364
20 miles or so.

35:21.897 --> 35:23.066
You don't know.

35:23.166 --> 35:25.970
Hey, it's not my car, Laura.
I didn't fill it up.

35:26.770 --> 35:29.204
We just gotta find a new car.

35:53.829 --> 35:55.900
Dad, what is going on?

35:56.400 --> 35:58.069
We need a new ride.

36:00.269 --> 36:02.872
- Hey, what about that one?
- Yeah.

36:02.972 --> 36:05.275
Everybody stay here.
Laura, get behind the wheel.

36:05.375 --> 36:09.130
If you see anything,
just get out of here. Drive.

36:12.698 --> 36:14.500
Be safe.

36:28.731 --> 36:31.166
Is there someone in there?

36:55.249 --> 36:56.828
Just stay calm.

37:20.082 --> 37:23.252
- Jesus, look at that.
- Oh, my God.

37:59.989 --> 38:01.990
Oh, my God.

38:07.163 --> 38:10.249
Mom, no. You're gonna catch his attention.

39:24.275 --> 39:26.501
Go, go, go, go!

40:17.408 --> 40:20.781
- Where is it?
- We're close.

40:22.383 --> 40:24.454
Oh, man.

40:25.254 --> 40:27.288
This is it.

40:34.796 --> 40:36.832
All right, Ted.

40:37.632 --> 40:39.802
Told you guys.

40:39.902 --> 40:42.038
Teddy, we are here!

40:42.138 --> 40:44.216
- Hey, Uncle Ted?
- Knock again.

40:44.316 --> 40:45.942
Ted!

40:46.842 --> 40:50.296
- Uncle Ted!
- I know you can hear us. We're here.

40:50.396 --> 40:51.814
- Hello?
- Ted, buddy!

40:51.914 --> 40:54.550
Can you hear me, Ted? Uncle Ted.

40:54.650 --> 40:57.052
<i>Ted, hey, I know you're in there. Open up.</i>

40:57.152 --> 40:59.154
<i>Uncle Ted, can you hear me?</i>

40:59.254 --> 41:02.334
- <i>Teddy! Teddy!</i>
- <i>Is there another way in?</i>

41:02.434 --> 41:04.093
- Is he even inside?
- Yeah, he's in here.

41:04.193 --> 41:07.429
I'm just gonna grab a rock. See if you
can get his attention in the big one.

41:07.529 --> 41:08.597
Ted!

41:08.697 --> 41:11.671
- He's in there.
- It's Laura. Open up. We're here.

41:11.771 --> 41:13.869
Ted! He's in here.

41:16.205 --> 41:19.707
- Dad, are you sure he's in there?
- Yes. Ted! Ted!

41:26.048 --> 41:30.358
<i>Yeah, it's motion activated,
it's just gotta... it's gonna alert him.</i>

41:31.120 --> 41:32.808
<i>Ted!</i>

41:33.421 --> 41:35.108
Ted!

41:36.125 --> 41:40.261
Come on, Ted. Come on, buddy.
I know you're in there.

41:42.263 --> 41:44.617
Dad, what are we supposed to do?

41:48.202 --> 41:51.926
You guys just keep trying
over here. I'm gonna...

41:52.374 --> 41:55.284
- Just keep banging on that door.
- Dad!

41:55.384 --> 41:57.011
Ted!

41:58.646 --> 42:00.054
Hello?

42:02.383 --> 42:04.120
- Man!
- Ted!

42:04.220 --> 42:08.956
- Are you sure that this is the right place?
- Yes. I just talked to him.

42:22.670 --> 42:25.307
Dad. Dad, Mom, they're coming!
They're coming!

42:25.407 --> 42:27.766
- I know! Goddamn it!
- David!

42:27.866 --> 42:29.709
He's here!

42:34.248 --> 42:37.233
Come on. Try the door again.
Try the main door. Try the main door.

42:37.553 --> 42:39.689
Find something. Just...

42:39.789 --> 42:42.324
David! David!

42:42.424 --> 42:45.561
Okay. Come on, come on.

42:45.661 --> 42:49.764
Come on, come on.
Ty, give me a hand. Stand on it.

42:54.685 --> 42:57.140
- Uncle Ted, please let us in!
- David, they're here!

42:57.240 --> 42:59.976
- We gotta go now!
- Get back, get back.

43:00.076 --> 43:02.444
Uncle Ted, if you can hear me,
please just open the door.

43:02.544 --> 43:04.814
Please open the door, Uncle Ted.

43:05.564 --> 43:08.250
- Dad!
- <i>David, get in!</i>

43:08.350 --> 43:10.909
Dad, Dad, Dad, it's open!
It's open! Come on!

43:11.009 --> 43:12.914
Go, go, go!

43:13.014 --> 43:16.273
- Go, go, go!
- Close it, close it, close it!

43:21.646 --> 43:24.499
- Everybody okay?
- We're good.

43:24.816 --> 43:27.186
Ted. Ted!

43:27.286 --> 43:30.856
I'm sorry. I didn't hear you
until you started banging.

43:30.956 --> 43:33.192
Awesome place, Ted.

43:33.292 --> 43:36.395
Saltwater sprinklers. Thanks, kid.

43:36.695 --> 43:39.523
- Hi, I'm Maddie.
- Hi, Maddie. Nice to meet you.

43:39.623 --> 43:41.304
- Thank you so much.
- Stella, hey.

43:41.404 --> 43:45.704
I'm glad you made it. Laura,
oh, my gosh. I'm so glad you're here.

43:45.804 --> 43:49.821
David, you were supposed to be
up here before the eclipse.

43:55.980 --> 43:58.184
David, this is Garrett.

43:58.584 --> 44:00.852
Corporal Garrett Jensen.

44:02.286 --> 44:04.300
Homeland Security.

44:07.425 --> 44:12.368
David Sheppard. That's my kid Tyler,
and his mom, my ex-wife.

44:12.598 --> 44:16.135
Garrett's father and I
were in the Gulf War together.

44:17.035 --> 44:20.540
I got... I got separated from my unit.

44:22.740 --> 44:26.966
Lucky for me, I remembered good
old Ted here had this place, so...

44:27.666 --> 44:29.713
here I am.

44:30.814 --> 44:32.883
That was lucky.

44:39.657 --> 44:43.062
- My sidearm bothering you, friend?
- Guns make me nervous.

44:44.062 --> 44:46.069
Ain't that the point?

44:55.939 --> 44:58.177
They gonna do that all night?

44:58.277 --> 45:01.246
Yeah, they probably will now.
The buzzards know we're here.

45:01.346 --> 45:04.883
Nothing is getting in here
without an invitation.

45:04.983 --> 45:06.352
I can attest to that.

45:06.452 --> 45:09.721
If I was you, I think I'd feel
lucky to be in here at all.

45:10.271 --> 45:13.509
This is one of those days that no one
should have to live through,

45:13.609 --> 45:16.495
let alone a second time,
but we are going to.

45:16.595 --> 45:18.697
We're gonna survive this. All of us.

45:18.797 --> 45:21.166
Now how about we get dinner started?

45:21.266 --> 45:23.502
Burn through some time here.

45:23.602 --> 45:28.407
You guys made it just in time for one
of Stella's all-time special recipes.

45:28.507 --> 45:31.710
- Right, baby?
- I guess so, if you like stew.

45:31.810 --> 45:35.245
- Laura, would you mind helping me?
- Plenty of stew for everyone.

45:39.516 --> 45:42.152
What? Yeah. That would be great.

46:04.609 --> 46:06.497
<i>Is anyone listening?</i>

46:08.113 --> 46:09.887
Pardon me.

46:17.522 --> 46:20.591
The world's gonna be
a different place by morning.

46:24.028 --> 46:26.331
It's gonna be a long night.

46:26.431 --> 46:28.599
Give me a hand with this.

46:50.487 --> 46:52.576
Can they see us through the walls?

46:52.676 --> 46:54.865
Like by heat or something?

46:57.262 --> 47:00.530
- That's not how it works.
- How's it work then?

47:02.400 --> 47:04.569
I don't know exactly.

47:04.669 --> 47:08.141
Like they say, movement, light.

47:08.607 --> 47:10.677
You know what I think?

47:11.777 --> 47:14.180
I think they see right into you.

47:16.080 --> 47:17.885
Right into your soul.

47:21.485 --> 47:25.410
I think it's crystal clear that these
things are the devil's work...

47:26.390 --> 47:28.659
and therefore, creatures of God.

47:28.759 --> 47:30.705
They're here to test us.

47:30.805 --> 47:34.633
Test you. Test your spirit.
Test your guts.

47:34.733 --> 47:39.522
They might tear your flesh,
but they're feeding on your soul.

47:40.605 --> 47:43.087
Are you a religious man, corporal?

47:45.676 --> 47:47.513
I am today.

47:48.113 --> 47:51.640
Were you in the military
during the first Day of Reckoning?

47:55.686 --> 48:00.526
I was... I was on a refinery 15 years ago.

48:00.926 --> 48:03.579
Down south in Louisiana
when the first one hit.

48:03.679 --> 48:07.916
They... they come right up,
right up from underneath us.

48:08.016 --> 48:12.361
Black things with black eyes,
clawing and tearing.

48:13.172 --> 48:16.942
157 of us on that rig...

48:17.442 --> 48:19.310
and all of them...

48:20.978 --> 48:22.714
I ran.

48:24.164 --> 48:26.618
Ran right into this refuse pond
right out back,

48:26.718 --> 48:30.952
and it was so thick with salt,
it was like mud.

48:31.723 --> 48:34.541
And I just buried myself...

48:34.941 --> 48:39.031
in that white slop.

48:40.331 --> 48:42.534
I could see them in the skies though,

48:42.634 --> 48:45.337
charging and stomping,

48:45.437 --> 48:47.806
attacking anything that moved.

48:47.906 --> 48:50.408
Millions. Millions.

48:51.208 --> 48:54.380
So I stayed there, just watching.

48:54.880 --> 48:58.151
All my workmates, all my friends...

48:59.251 --> 49:01.253
just getting eaten alive.

49:06.023 --> 49:07.547
But...

49:07.976 --> 49:11.307
that's why they call it
the Day of Reckoning.

49:12.762 --> 49:15.032
It's the day God gives to the devil.

49:29.730 --> 49:34.000
How about some of us
try to get some sleep?

49:35.136 --> 49:37.172
Yeah, sure.

49:37.272 --> 49:40.242
Yeah, I think a little shut-eye
might be good for us all?

49:40.342 --> 49:42.811
I'd be happy to take the first watch.

49:42.911 --> 49:47.683
And I'd be happier to have another touch
of that intoxicating whiskey, miss Stella.

49:50.785 --> 49:53.088
How about a game of cards?

49:53.188 --> 49:56.692
- Yeah, sounds good.
- You guys play. I'm beat.

49:56.792 --> 50:01.531
Come on, Laura. One game. You and me
versus Ted and Stella. It'll be fun.

50:02.431 --> 50:05.507
I'm good. You guys play.
I'm beat. Good night, guys.

50:05.607 --> 50:08.804
Laura, just one game.

50:09.832 --> 50:12.240
I don't think he wants you to go to sleep.

50:16.678 --> 50:19.033
All right, why don't we all just relax...

50:19.714 --> 50:21.116
Okay.

50:21.216 --> 50:24.060
This is what we call
"military intervention."

50:24.420 --> 50:29.327
Now, why don't you just put that knife
back on the table there, friend?

50:41.935 --> 50:46.776
- What the hell is this?
- He's been holding us hostage, Laura.

50:47.176 --> 50:49.679
Did you just clue into that?

50:50.479 --> 50:54.450
Ted, he was... he was not gonna let me in,

50:54.550 --> 50:58.453
but Stella, she's got
a real soft heart, bless her.

50:58.553 --> 51:00.354
Bless her.

51:02.321 --> 51:04.795
Alright, I just need the shelter
for the rest of the night.

51:04.895 --> 51:07.626
- Then we can all go our separate ways.
- Why don't you just calm down?

51:07.726 --> 51:11.433
- I'm really losing my patience with you.
- Hey, we're all in here together.

51:11.533 --> 51:13.502
This is crazy. No one's gonna do anything.

51:13.602 --> 51:17.372
- Why'd you have that knife?
- It's down now. Just put down the gun.

51:17.472 --> 51:21.493
You know what's going on out there.
You don't wanna bring that in here, right?

51:21.593 --> 51:23.312
No one's done anything to you.

51:23.412 --> 51:26.348
I'm starting to feel like I'm...
I'm not really welcome here anymore.

51:26.448 --> 51:28.277
Yeah, okay, think about it, right?

51:28.377 --> 51:31.825
What are you gonna do? You gonna shoot us?
Start piling up carcasses in here?

51:31.925 --> 51:34.890
- You don't think they're gonna smell that?
- I'll do whatever I gotta do.

51:34.990 --> 51:39.094
I survived the last one, okay?
I can survive the next one.

51:39.194 --> 51:40.435
Yeah.

51:45.166 --> 51:48.337
All right. Nice try. Nice try, really.

51:48.437 --> 51:51.303
Ain't gonna be no heroes today, okay?

51:51.973 --> 51:54.179
- Now...
- Quiet!

51:54.279 --> 51:56.489
- Listen.
- What?

51:57.279 --> 52:00.081
I'm not hearing anything, right?
I mean, where did they go?

52:19.000 --> 52:20.868
It's too quiet.

52:58.773 --> 53:00.808
Well, it works on vampires.

53:05.513 --> 53:07.982
It's gonna be all right, baby.

53:08.517 --> 53:09.885
Dad!

53:09.985 --> 53:12.486
All right, get down, get down.

53:15.189 --> 53:18.827
Tyler, get over here and tie him up.
Tie his hands.

53:20.350 --> 53:23.232
- Laura, find where it came in.
- Oh, my God.

53:23.432 --> 53:25.866
She needs medical attention now.

53:32.072 --> 53:34.676
Stella, look at me, honey.
You're gonna be okay, okay?

53:34.776 --> 53:37.680
- We don't have much time.
- Stella, honey, look at me if you can.

53:37.780 --> 53:39.999
I'm right here, okay?

53:40.099 --> 53:43.388
- Sorry, we gotta wrap 'er up, we gotta go.
- We're not leaving, damn it.

53:43.488 --> 53:45.752
I can't help her out there.

53:49.457 --> 53:51.960
- It's okay, Stella.
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

53:52.060 --> 53:54.595
I can do it. I can do it.

54:03.554 --> 54:05.357
We won't last two minutes
when they get in here.

54:05.457 --> 54:08.152
- Those doors will hold.
- Not for eight hours.

54:18.769 --> 54:20.971
We're running out of time.

54:24.375 --> 54:26.478
There's a back tunnel...

54:26.578 --> 54:29.181
leads to the canyon on the north side.

54:29.281 --> 54:31.697
Good cover. You go.

54:32.917 --> 54:34.720
Y'all just gonna leave me here?

54:34.820 --> 54:39.435
Ted, you know what's happening to me.

54:43.761 --> 54:46.330
You can't stay here, baby.

54:47.865 --> 54:51.437
I got a vehicle. I hid it
in the valley about two miles away.

54:51.537 --> 54:54.474
I didn't tell Ted 'cause I didn't think
he'd let me in if he knew I had a ride.

54:54.574 --> 54:57.075
- Another goddamn lie!
- For survival, Ted!

54:57.175 --> 55:00.612
It's called the Day of Reckoning, not
the day of let's all just be best friends.

55:00.712 --> 55:04.416
It's got a full tank of gas.
I can get you a long way from here.

55:04.516 --> 55:06.518
And go where?

55:08.018 --> 55:10.789
The gate. The gate's about...

55:10.889 --> 55:13.892
- it's only 12 miles away.
- The gate? That's your idea? The gate?

55:13.992 --> 55:17.567
- That's where these monsters came from.
- They're not there anymore.

55:17.667 --> 55:20.466
It's a secure facility,
and they got safe rooms for personnel,

55:20.566 --> 55:24.202
but I can get you all in. All of y'all.

55:26.304 --> 55:28.774
- You got a better idea?
- Why didn't you mention this before?

55:28.874 --> 55:31.971
I got cut off. I told you that!

55:34.979 --> 55:37.414
They'll have medical attention there.

55:40.051 --> 55:41.352
All right.

55:42.953 --> 55:44.754
Let's go.

55:48.392 --> 55:52.397
You get us to your facility in one piece,
maybe we'll forget about tonight.

55:52.497 --> 55:55.366
- Right?
- I'll get you there.

56:05.676 --> 56:07.346
Shotgun.

56:07.446 --> 56:09.949
- I call it.
- Rock salt rounds.

56:10.049 --> 56:11.785
Grenade launcher.

56:13.751 --> 56:15.752
Street sweeper.

56:20.558 --> 56:22.178
Hey.

56:25.596 --> 56:27.398
You never know.

56:30.501 --> 56:31.749
I'm good.

56:51.622 --> 56:53.490
It's time.

57:52.850 --> 57:55.787
- How much further, friend?
- I'd say it's about a couple clicks.

57:55.887 --> 57:59.695
- That's military speak for a kilometer.
- Yes, smart ass, I know what that is.

57:59.795 --> 58:02.251
Just keep on point.

58:03.729 --> 58:05.997
- I'm fine.
- You're okay. You're okay.

58:06.097 --> 58:08.324
I could help y'all carry stuff
if I wasn't tied up.

58:08.424 --> 58:12.067
You don't need your hands
to walk, corporal. Keep moving.

58:13.337 --> 58:15.240
Think we can trust him?

58:15.340 --> 58:18.377
Yeah, for now,
as long as we're all at risk.

58:19.677 --> 58:21.478
You know...

58:23.981 --> 58:25.816
I just...

58:26.951 --> 58:32.199
- What? I didn't say anything.
- It's just your timing. As always, it's...

58:33.225 --> 58:36.061
Well, not everything revolves
around your schedule.

58:36.161 --> 58:39.363
Are you guys seriously
gonna do this right now?

58:39.463 --> 58:42.501
We should be in that shelter
right now with everyone else.

58:42.601 --> 58:45.838
Not out here, like last time.

58:46.238 --> 58:49.299
- This isn't like last time.
- Why? 'Cause you're actually here?

58:49.399 --> 58:52.043
- Mom.
- Sorry, buddy.

59:21.239 --> 59:22.874
- Tyler...
- It's dead.

59:22.974 --> 59:26.476
Yeah, it doesn't matter.
Stand back. Get back over here.

59:29.747 --> 59:33.652
Looks like it's in pain.
Like it's screaming or something.

59:33.752 --> 59:35.986
It'd be a really cool Instagram.

59:37.721 --> 59:40.524
Come on, get your stuff. Let's go.

59:58.375 --> 59:59.976
Maddie!

01:00:00.811 --> 01:00:02.513
Sorry, I'm coming.

01:00:10.053 --> 01:00:11.735
Help me, Tyler!

01:00:13.458 --> 01:00:15.727
Maddie, Maddie, Maddie!

01:00:15.827 --> 01:00:19.062
Come here! Come here! Maddie, no!

01:00:23.501 --> 01:00:25.505
No! No, no, no.

01:00:33.911 --> 01:00:37.347
Let's go. Let's go. Go, go, go, go!

01:00:40.050 --> 01:00:42.319
David, I can help.

01:01:40.301 --> 01:01:43.286
Come on, let's go.

01:02:03.791 --> 01:02:05.859
You gotta be kidding me.

01:02:09.961 --> 01:02:11.372
What was that?

01:02:14.301 --> 01:02:17.120
- What?
- Jinn.

01:02:17.972 --> 01:02:20.006
I set that kill switch.

01:02:22.811 --> 01:02:25.366
- Start the car.
- Come on!

01:02:25.466 --> 01:02:27.323
Start the car.

01:02:39.927 --> 01:02:42.595
I forgot I hit the kill switch.

01:02:44.999 --> 01:02:46.968
Stella! No!

01:02:47.068 --> 01:02:50.652
Stella, please! Stella, please!

01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:54.948
Stella! No!

01:02:58.712 --> 01:03:01.350
Give me the gun. No, Stella, no.

01:03:01.650 --> 01:03:05.720
Don't do that, Stella.
Stella, don't do that.

01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:09.469
Don't. Don't, Stella, no.

01:03:10.724 --> 01:03:12.361
Don't you dare!

01:03:12.461 --> 01:03:15.930
Give me the gun, Stella.
Give me the gun, Stella!

01:03:16.030 --> 01:03:19.568
No! No! Give me the gun.

01:03:19.668 --> 01:03:23.339
Stella, please, give me the gun.

01:03:24.339 --> 01:03:26.742
Give me the gun, baby.

01:03:28.342 --> 01:03:30.745
Give me the gun, honey.

01:03:31.745 --> 01:03:34.747
Give it... give it to me!

01:03:36.517 --> 01:03:38.954
Come here, Stella. Stella, come to me.

01:03:39.054 --> 01:03:42.357
- Ted, that's enough.
- Come here. No! Come here!

01:03:42.457 --> 01:03:45.660
Stella! Stella! Come here!

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:49.631
We gotta go. They're coming.
They're coming. Come on, get in! Go, go!

01:03:49.731 --> 01:03:52.199
Now! Now! Go! Go!

01:03:54.068 --> 01:03:57.206
- We gotta go! We gotta go!
- Stella!

01:03:58.306 --> 01:04:00.874
- Drive!
- Stella!

01:04:01.375 --> 01:04:02.816
Stella!

01:04:03.744 --> 01:04:05.546
Stella!

01:04:06.847 --> 01:04:09.384
- Come on, go!
- No!

01:04:09.484 --> 01:04:11.308
Drive now!

01:04:33.774 --> 01:04:36.812
<i>Now there's been no break
in the attacks so far.</i>

01:04:36.912 --> 01:04:39.945
<i>The whole area was under siege
throughout the night.</i>

01:04:40.045 --> 01:04:42.992
<i>Evacuation centers did not hold,</i>

01:04:43.092 --> 01:04:47.088
<i>and Topanga Shelter
was leveled during the attack.</i>

01:04:47.188 --> 01:04:50.792
<i>Our early reports indicate that
there has been mass destruction</i>

01:04:50.892 --> 01:04:54.295
<i>of multiple safety zones in that area.</i>

01:05:21.488 --> 01:05:25.092
Unit five-four-niner to base.
I'm carrying wounded civilians. Over.

01:05:27.895 --> 01:05:31.144
This is five-four-niner.
Do you read? Over.

01:05:32.833 --> 01:05:34.701
Anybody there?

01:05:36.336 --> 01:05:38.772
Why would they have the door open?

01:05:39.973 --> 01:05:41.777
I don't know.

01:05:42.777 --> 01:05:44.578
Let's go see.

01:05:45.613 --> 01:05:47.198
Do you mind?

01:06:34.328 --> 01:06:36.732
I thought you said someone would be here.

01:06:37.332 --> 01:06:39.436
There should be,

01:06:39.536 --> 01:06:41.773
unless something went wrong.

01:07:14.368 --> 01:07:16.206
Where is everyone?

01:07:17.506 --> 01:07:20.675
I don't know what happened.
Maybe they're all in safe rooms.

01:07:20.775 --> 01:07:23.985
- Where are those?
- Lower level.

01:07:24.345 --> 01:07:26.179
Basement.

01:07:28.215 --> 01:07:29.818
Ted.

01:07:30.018 --> 01:07:31.573
Your back.

01:07:31.673 --> 01:07:33.720
What the hell?

01:07:34.722 --> 01:07:37.826
- It's nothing.
- Do you guys got a hospital here?

01:07:37.926 --> 01:07:41.296
Not at this end, but there's
a supply room. Downstairs.

01:07:41.396 --> 01:07:43.532
All right, corporal.

01:07:43.632 --> 01:07:45.505
Down we go.

01:07:53.607 --> 01:07:56.477
We gotta get this power back on,
so we can actually get into the safe rooms.

01:07:56.577 --> 01:07:59.781
- Get me to the machine room. I can do it.
- It's up here on the left. I'll show you.

01:07:59.881 --> 01:08:02.349
And medical's all the way down the hall.

01:08:03.784 --> 01:08:05.651
Come on, Maddie.

01:08:06.186 --> 01:08:08.689
Hey, go with them. I'll...

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:12.088
I'll catch up
after I get this knocked out.

01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:22.102
Are you ready, sweetheart?

01:08:24.571 --> 01:08:26.875
They've been fracking this hole for years,

01:08:26.975 --> 01:08:30.444
flooding it with saltwater
as a defense measure.

01:08:30.845 --> 01:08:33.964
They even pulled a mountain
of salt from the local flats, but...

01:08:34.064 --> 01:08:35.984
the hole's too deep.

01:08:36.084 --> 01:08:39.496
They kept us on standby
in case it ever happened again.

01:08:49.729 --> 01:08:51.600
Oh, great.

01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:55.136
- Laura, will you grab that?
- Careful. Careful, careful.

01:08:55.236 --> 01:08:57.270
How does it look?

01:09:11.151 --> 01:09:14.220
- Hey.
- Not too bad.

01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:20.799
Go, Dad.

01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:23.231
- You're pretty handy.
- Let's go find those guys.

01:09:23.331 --> 01:09:25.545
Get down to a safe room.

01:09:49.328 --> 01:09:52.125
This is gonna sting
just a little bit, okay?

01:09:54.799 --> 01:09:56.633
Where is he?

01:09:57.656 --> 01:09:59.336
We should hurry it up.

01:10:01.205 --> 01:10:03.896
- You see him?
- Hey.

01:10:03.996 --> 01:10:07.213
They're inside the facility.
We need to get somewhere secure.

01:10:07.313 --> 01:10:10.616
- We only have two hours left.
- That can be a long time.

01:10:10.716 --> 01:10:12.785
There's a storage room
where we first come in.

01:10:12.885 --> 01:10:15.221
Volatile chemicals,
so the doors are blast proof.

01:10:15.321 --> 01:10:18.040
Good. Let's go.

01:10:19.874 --> 01:10:21.743
How's he doing?

01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:50.264
David! Gun!

01:11:21.919 --> 01:11:24.322
- Hey! What the hell?
- Hey!

01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:31.653
I'm sorry.

01:11:36.184 --> 01:11:38.273
Come on, come on, let's go.

01:11:56.237 --> 01:11:58.004
Okay.

01:11:59.541 --> 01:12:02.209
Go, go, go. Come on, come on, come on.

01:12:06.848 --> 01:12:08.651
We good?

01:12:08.751 --> 01:12:11.298
- We good?
- Yeah.

01:12:22.497 --> 01:12:24.369
What are we gonna do?

01:12:29.137 --> 01:12:31.941
- Water pipes?
- These are the dispersal lines here,

01:12:32.041 --> 01:12:35.144
so the circulation tank must be
somewhere on the other side of this wall.

01:12:35.244 --> 01:12:36.846
God, David.

01:12:36.946 --> 01:12:39.783
- Yeah, this is the easy part.
- What are you gonna do?

01:12:40.883 --> 01:12:42.716
Even the odds.

01:12:43.985 --> 01:12:45.588
Come here.

01:12:45.738 --> 01:12:48.941
You're doing a good job, buddy, okay?
I got one more job for you.

01:12:49.041 --> 01:12:51.377
You take care of your mom while I'm gone.

01:12:54.713 --> 01:12:59.051
Okay, these pipes feed a salinization
system somewhere in here.

01:12:59.151 --> 01:13:01.587
I'm gonna redirect the saltwater
to the circulation tank.

01:13:01.687 --> 01:13:03.519
What do you need from me?

01:13:04.589 --> 01:13:08.033
- Keep my family safe.
- I can do that.

01:13:12.364 --> 01:13:14.031
Hey.

01:13:19.237 --> 01:13:22.041
Is this really the time for that?

01:13:22.941 --> 01:13:25.142
I'll meet you guys back here.

01:13:28.813 --> 01:13:30.816
Just be safe.

01:13:30.916 --> 01:13:32.750
Be safe.

01:13:57.875 --> 01:13:59.412
Come on.

01:13:59.512 --> 01:14:02.379
- Guys, come on.
- Run, run, run, run, go!

01:16:43.809 --> 01:16:47.411
- We can't go this way! It's a dead end!
- What?

01:16:49.046 --> 01:16:50.749
Come on.

01:16:50.849 --> 01:16:53.116
Oh, my God, look!

01:17:12.403 --> 01:17:14.390
<i>Pull the fire alarm.</i>

01:17:14.490 --> 01:17:17.191
<i>Pull the fire alarm! Pull it!</i>

01:17:22.279 --> 01:17:24.716
Keep your family safe, kid.

01:17:29.354 --> 01:17:32.199
Make room, meat.

01:17:40.999 --> 01:17:43.067
Uncle Ted, no!

01:17:45.303 --> 01:17:46.691
Laura!

01:17:53.545 --> 01:17:55.479
Tyler, there!

01:18:01.618 --> 01:18:03.756
No. I'm out! I'm out!

01:18:03.856 --> 01:18:06.923
- Ted, no, no, Ted!
- Tyler! Tyler!

01:19:10.454 --> 01:19:12.289
It's over.

01:19:15.092 --> 01:19:17.104
Let's get out of here.

01:19:34.111 --> 01:19:35.746
They're coming back.

01:20:09.213 --> 01:20:11.215
Tyler! Tyler!

01:20:13.150 --> 01:20:14.118
No.

01:20:14.686 --> 01:20:18.617
Are you okay? Are you okay?
Look at me. Are you okay?

01:20:18.717 --> 01:20:20.525
I'm sorry.

01:20:21.426 --> 01:20:23.829
This is not our world anymore.

01:20:23.949 --> 01:20:27.921
That's okay. Don't worry about him.
He's not gonna be hurting very much longer.

01:20:28.521 --> 01:20:30.522
None of us will.

01:20:32.726 --> 01:20:34.728
I told you.

01:20:35.628 --> 01:20:38.032
God took today off.

01:20:39.232 --> 01:20:41.087
This is the devil's day.

01:20:41.187 --> 01:20:42.800
No!

01:20:46.994 --> 01:20:51.409
It's okay. All right, baby.
Ty, are you all right? Help him out.

01:20:57.116 --> 01:20:59.250
Dad! Dad! Dad!

01:21:06.726 --> 01:21:08.209
Stay down.

01:21:13.598 --> 01:21:17.174
- David?
- Stay down. Stay down, it's okay.

01:21:40.178 --> 01:21:41.959
Oh, man.

01:21:46.364 --> 01:21:48.868
Okay, okay, okay.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:21:48.968 --> 01:21:52.238
Grab that. Grab that, grab that.
Okay, okay.

01:21:52.338 --> 01:21:55.274
Okay, we need some hydrosulfite. Here.

01:21:55.374 --> 01:21:58.275
We need water. Water, water, water!

01:22:09.187 --> 01:22:12.322
- Ready?
- Guys, guys, we need to hurry.

01:22:14.326 --> 01:22:15.961
We need tape. Tape! Tape!

01:22:16.061 --> 01:22:19.190
- Where's the duct tape?
- Here's the tape.

01:22:20.199 --> 01:22:22.703
- Guys, guys, guys...
- Get back there. Get back there.

01:22:24.003 --> 01:22:26.086
David, come on.

01:22:26.186 --> 01:22:28.994
We've got to go now, guys!
Come on! Come on, hurry!

01:22:31.276 --> 01:22:34.928
We gotta go now, guys!
Come on! We have to go now!

01:22:36.311 --> 01:22:38.014
Get over here!

01:22:59.371 --> 01:23:02.373
- Everybody okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:23:11.742 --> 01:23:13.744
This hurts so bad!

01:23:29.367 --> 01:23:31.370
You're fine.

01:23:31.470 --> 01:23:33.303
You're fine.

01:24:00.215 --> 01:24:01.882
Hey.

01:24:03.001 --> 01:24:05.014
Can I drive?

01:24:05.471 --> 01:24:07.248
No.

01:24:11.142 --> 01:24:14.582
<i>But for now, the darkness has passed...</i>

01:24:14.682 --> 01:24:17.015
<i>and it's a time of recovery,</i>

01:24:17.115 --> 01:24:20.152
<i>to stand once again in the face of evil</i>

01:24:20.252 --> 01:24:23.639
<i>and let it be known
that we will not kneel.</i>

01:24:23.739 --> 01:24:25.758
<i>We will not cower.</i>

01:24:25.858 --> 01:24:29.961
<i>We will fight,
and we shall not be defeated.</i>
