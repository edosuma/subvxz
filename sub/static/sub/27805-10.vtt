WEBVTT

00:01.659 --> 00:04.910
Oh, my God, I can't believe
the wedding is in ten days!

00:05.151 --> 00:07.296
Oh, my God, the wedding is in ten days.

00:07.381 --> 00:09.465
Babe, please, pick an emotion.

00:09.550 --> 00:11.550
It's just there's so much to do.

00:11.586 --> 00:14.003
Shannon, Ben? Would one of you pick up

00:14.088 --> 00:15.721
the welcome bags for
the out-of-town guests?

00:15.756 --> 00:17.789
Well, sounds to me like
you're gonna need somebody

00:17.842 --> 00:20.059
very dependable for that responsibility,

00:20.094 --> 00:22.228
so... Ben?

00:24.315 --> 00:26.398
I don't want to complain,
Clem, but Shannon is your

00:26.434 --> 00:29.235
maid of honor and I'm
just your bridesboy,

00:29.270 --> 00:31.520
yet I seem to be doing everything.

00:31.606 --> 00:33.772
Come on, that's not true.

00:33.824 --> 00:37.109
Look at this list. Ben, Ben,
Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben.

00:37.161 --> 00:39.194
There is only one place
I like hearing my name

00:39.247 --> 00:41.497
called out that many times,
and to put it politely,

00:41.582 --> 00:43.249
none of y'all would be there.

00:46.203 --> 00:49.288
Oh, Shannon,
there is one thing that you could do.

00:49.340 --> 00:51.957
I need somebody to help me pick
out a cute pair of sneakers

00:52.009 --> 00:53.509
to change into after the ceremony.

00:53.594 --> 00:57.263
Wow, Clem, you're gonna be wearing
those for most of your wedding.

00:57.298 --> 01:00.766
That is a huge thing to trust me with.

01:05.188 --> 01:07.139
Fine. I'll do it.

01:07.608 --> 01:09.058
Thank you.

01:09.143 --> 01:12.194
Okay, I'm just gonna have
to make this fun for myself.

01:12.280 --> 01:15.364
I'll find a store with a hot salesman
who has great taste in shoes.

01:16.264 --> 01:18.144
Which will have to be Bloomie's
'cause I've already

01:18.169 --> 01:21.203
"tried on all the shoes" at Barney's.

01:23.991 --> 01:25.240
So what do you need sneakers for?

01:25.326 --> 01:27.209
I can't dance all night in heels,

01:27.295 --> 01:29.295
even though our first
dance is just gonna be us

01:29.330 --> 01:33.198
swaying back and forth like
a lame eighth grade dance.

01:33.250 --> 01:34.550
Um...

01:34.635 --> 01:39.037
my eighth grade dance was
a straight-up grind fest.

01:39.090 --> 01:40.839
Besides, I thought
you guys were gonna salsa,

01:40.891 --> 01:43.542
like you always dreamed of.
What happened?

01:43.594 --> 01:46.545
Nothing. We just decided, as a couple,

01:46.597 --> 01:48.981
that Nick is uncomfortable
dancing in public.

01:49.016 --> 01:50.733
I'm not uncomfortable.

01:50.818 --> 01:52.985
Look, I just don't like the terror

01:53.020 --> 01:55.020
that it instills in every
part of my body, okay?

01:56.857 --> 01:58.240
I don't know what your issue is.

01:58.326 --> 01:59.775
- You're a great dancer.
- Yes.

01:59.860 --> 02:01.276
Sure, here, with you in the kitchen.

02:01.362 --> 02:05.247
I mean, I can do this... ugh, ugh...

02:05.333 --> 02:06.415
all day long.

02:06.500 --> 02:10.836
You can, but the question is,
should you?

02:11.439 --> 02:13.539
How do we feel about the
sneakers at Nordstrom?

02:13.591 --> 02:15.708
'Cause I just remembered I may have...

02:15.760 --> 02:18.177
tried on all the shoes
at Bloomie's, too.

02:27.929 --> 02:28.887
Hey, Nick.

02:28.939 --> 02:31.140
- Can you do me a favor?
- What's up?

02:31.225 --> 02:33.642
My sody's all the way over there.

02:39.233 --> 02:40.199
Thank you.

02:48.075 --> 02:49.158
Respect.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.132
- Hey, Freddy. How's it going?
- Where's Clem?

02:57.218 --> 02:59.218
I'm great, thank you for asking.

03:00.334 --> 03:03.055
Hey, Shannon. How's work?

03:03.765 --> 03:06.058
I'm in tenth grade.

03:07.240 --> 03:08.310
Hey, Dad.

03:08.396 --> 03:09.595
What do you want?

03:09.647 --> 03:12.014
Every time I show up,
you ask me what do I want,

03:12.099 --> 03:13.399
like you're not happy to see me.

03:13.434 --> 03:15.934
So what do you want?

03:17.069 --> 03:19.688
I sort of need a favor.
There was an incident at work.

03:19.774 --> 03:23.158
We were investigating a
possible homicide out in Queens.

03:23.244 --> 03:25.527
Found a bag of heads, and, uh,

03:25.613 --> 03:28.580
we realized, yup, homicide.

03:29.195 --> 03:32.367
Whoa, you found a bag of heads?

03:32.453 --> 03:34.036
Yeah, what did I just say?

03:35.372 --> 03:37.256
Anyway, Clem...

03:38.959 --> 03:42.461
...the department classifies that as
"on-the-job trauma,"

03:42.513 --> 03:44.296
so they're making me get counseling,

03:44.348 --> 03:47.165
and I figured since your future
mother-in-law is a shrink,

03:47.218 --> 03:48.801
I was hoping you could ask her to...

03:48.853 --> 03:51.770
Uh-uh. No way.
I am not letting you use Rose

03:51.806 --> 03:53.605
- for free counseling.
- I don't need Rose

03:53.641 --> 03:55.107
for free counseling.

03:55.142 --> 03:58.477
I just need her to sign a form
that says I had counseling.

03:59.552 --> 04:03.649
Oh... you just want Rose
to commit fraud.

04:03.701 --> 04:06.652
Why does your generation
have to label everything?

04:07.691 --> 04:10.989
I just want to deal with my
psychological stress in a normal way.

04:11.024 --> 04:14.660
You mean, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug?

04:14.695 --> 04:17.245
No, more like glug, glug, puff, puff,

04:17.331 --> 04:19.248
lady, lady, glug, glug.

04:20.668 --> 04:21.800
Forget it, Dad.

04:21.836 --> 04:23.168
I'm not gonna let you
use Rose like that.

04:23.220 --> 04:24.336
Fine.

04:25.193 --> 04:28.140
Nick, my future son-in-law.

04:28.624 --> 04:30.008
How's it going, buddy?

04:30.060 --> 04:31.781
Don't fall for it, Nick!

04:31.813 --> 04:34.146
Freddy, there's absolutely no way

04:34.181 --> 04:36.047
I'm helping you with my mother.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.850
But I'm fine, thanks for asking.

04:41.906 --> 04:44.773
So I guess the only thing
we haven't finalized

04:44.859 --> 04:47.993
is whether or not your father
will sing at the wedding.

04:48.028 --> 04:50.329
Rose, don't put any pressure on them.

04:50.364 --> 04:52.331
You kids can decide later.

04:52.366 --> 04:55.033
♪ But considering I'm
a Broadway star... ♪

04:56.704 --> 04:58.754
You got to give the
people what they want.

05:00.591 --> 05:03.074
Ooh! You could sing for our first dance.

05:03.127 --> 05:07.846
Do you know any songs
that are slow and boring?

05:08.406 --> 05:09.460
Do I?

05:12.019 --> 05:15.086
I remember our first dance.

05:15.139 --> 05:17.623
People said I couldn't do
The Worm in my gown.

05:18.192 --> 05:20.642
I proved them wrong.

05:20.728 --> 05:22.361
I wish I could've seen that.

05:22.396 --> 05:23.812
- Oh, you will.
- Mm-hmm.

05:26.509 --> 05:29.434
Dad, I need your help.

05:29.486 --> 05:31.609
Clem wants to do a big salsa number,

05:31.644 --> 05:34.823
okay, but I am freaked out about
doing it in front of a crowd.

05:34.910 --> 05:36.910
Son, you're great in front of a crowd.

05:36.911 --> 05:38.043
You're a college professor.

05:38.078 --> 05:39.778
You lecture to hundreds of people a day.

05:39.830 --> 05:43.081
Yes, yes, I do,
but not on my tippy toes.

05:43.133 --> 05:46.117
Well, lucky for you, son,
I know a thing or two

05:46.170 --> 05:49.421
about public humiliation. I was in <i> Cats.</i>

05:50.317 --> 05:51.423
Tell you what,

05:51.475 --> 05:53.625
I'll come over this week
and help you lose your fear.

05:53.677 --> 05:56.395
You really think it'll work?
'Cause I want to surprise Clem.

05:56.430 --> 05:58.480
I know it will. Wear comfortable shoes,

05:58.566 --> 06:01.350
eat a good breakfast,
and stretch beforehand.

06:01.435 --> 06:05.487
♪ 'Cause your thighs
are gonna be on fire! ♪

06:07.274 --> 06:09.992
Thank you so much for picking
up the tablecloths tomorrow.

06:10.077 --> 06:11.326
I would do it myself,

06:11.412 --> 06:13.528
but I kind of sort of can't drive.

06:13.614 --> 06:15.497
Wait, what? You can't drive?

06:15.583 --> 06:16.748
- Mm-mm.
- You know what?

06:16.784 --> 06:19.001
I am not gonna judge you
right before your wedding,

06:19.086 --> 06:23.488
so I am simply gonna say,
"Hey, girl, that's not weird."

06:23.540 --> 06:24.823
I know.

06:24.875 --> 06:27.993
My dad promised that he would teach me,
but he never did.

06:28.045 --> 06:30.429
Something always got in the way,

06:30.464 --> 06:34.182
and that something
usually became my stepmom.

06:34.268 --> 06:36.685
Sweetheart, I am really sorry

06:36.770 --> 06:39.021
Freddy broke all of his promises to you.

06:39.106 --> 06:41.773
Yeah, he's the worst. This morning,

06:41.809 --> 06:45.360
he told me that the police
department wants him to have therapy,

06:45.446 --> 06:48.030
and he asked me if you would
sign some form for him.

06:48.954 --> 06:50.616
Can you believe that?

06:50.651 --> 06:51.950
Send him to me.

06:51.986 --> 06:53.201
What?

06:53.287 --> 06:55.621
You heard me, baby, send him to me.

06:55.656 --> 06:57.155
Rose, no.

06:57.207 --> 06:59.691
Just because he's my father,
you shouldn't feel obligated

06:59.743 --> 07:01.376
to help him with one of his scams.

07:01.462 --> 07:04.162
Oh, I'm gonna help him,
all right, but not in the way

07:04.214 --> 07:06.381
he's expecting,

07:06.467 --> 07:08.050
and I'm not gonna give
him that signature

07:08.135 --> 07:10.252
until I see some actual growth.

07:10.337 --> 07:15.641
Good luck. The man can't even
grow the pot plant in his closet.

07:15.676 --> 07:17.225
Clem, you are gonna thank me.

07:17.311 --> 07:19.711
Don't you want to be in a
better place with your father

07:19.763 --> 07:20.879
before the wedding?

07:20.931 --> 07:24.016
Well, I'm not currently
seething with hatred

07:24.068 --> 07:25.734
every waking moment of the day,

07:25.819 --> 07:28.770
so we're kind of at an all-time high.

07:29.288 --> 07:32.324
But things are gonna be better,
you'll see.

07:32.359 --> 07:36.078
You just happen to be speaking
to the best damn therapist

07:36.163 --> 07:37.946
in the city of New York.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.667
You should put that on your card.

07:41.702 --> 07:44.619
Oh, my God, you did.

07:46.707 --> 07:48.457
Thanks for seeing me, Rose.

07:48.542 --> 07:50.042
Here's that form for you to sign.

07:50.094 --> 07:53.261
And, uh, here's 20 bucks
for your trouble.

07:53.347 --> 07:55.180
That's a five.

07:56.550 --> 07:58.016
But thank you.

07:58.811 --> 08:00.852
Ooh, now let me find my pen.

08:00.888 --> 08:03.638
You know, I get so overwhelmed,
I lose things.

08:03.724 --> 08:05.440
Do you ever get overwhelmed, Freddy?

08:06.333 --> 08:07.776
Nice try, Rose.

08:09.196 --> 08:11.229
Trying to trick me into
talking about my feelings.

08:11.281 --> 08:12.564
Well, it ain't gonna happen.

08:12.616 --> 08:16.952
Right, because real men don't
talk about their feelings.

08:17.037 --> 08:20.822
I understand. Most men
get that from their father.

08:20.908 --> 08:23.375
Not me. I never got
anything from my father,

08:23.410 --> 08:25.577
except for good hair and dyslexia.

08:27.664 --> 08:29.664
There it is.

08:29.750 --> 08:33.001
And it is out of ink. You know what?

08:33.087 --> 08:35.285
Freddy, why don't you have
a seat on the couch

08:35.339 --> 08:38.957
while I search for another one.

08:39.009 --> 08:40.893
So your father was a real jerk, huh?

08:40.995 --> 08:43.628
Eh, the louse was never home anyway.

08:43.679 --> 08:45.897
Chef Boyardee was the
closest thing I had

08:45.933 --> 08:48.650
to a male role model.

08:48.736 --> 08:51.603
Fat chef bastard.

08:52.488 --> 08:54.773
Well, it sounds like you
had to take care of yourself

08:54.825 --> 08:56.074
when you were a kid.

08:56.110 --> 08:59.277
Are you kidding?
I had to do everything for myself.

08:59.329 --> 09:02.748
One time I...
Do you mind if I put my feet up?

09:03.671 --> 09:04.666
Please.

09:13.969 --> 09:16.709
So Rose really thinks
she can fix our dad?

09:16.777 --> 09:19.578
Doesn't she have better ways
to completely waste her time?

09:19.613 --> 09:23.782
Hey, my mom is the best damn
therapist in New York City.

09:23.817 --> 09:25.284
Oh, yeah, I've seen the card.

09:26.374 --> 09:29.621
But trust me, you do not want
to go inside that man's head.

09:29.673 --> 09:31.823
It's just a bunch of lies, scams,

09:31.876 --> 09:34.710
and every line of dialogue from
<i>Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo.</i>

09:39.680 --> 09:42.701
- Dad, what do you want?
- That was hurtful.

09:44.205 --> 09:46.972
But I do understand why you said it.

09:50.439 --> 09:53.312
So, look, I was thinking,
when you were a kid,

09:53.364 --> 09:57.516
I promised to do some things that
I never got around to doing...

09:57.568 --> 10:00.285
which reminds me,
you should get vaccinated for measles.

10:00.745 --> 10:03.489
Yes, thank you,
I found that out the hard way.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.326
Anyway, I was remembering, you know,

10:07.378 --> 10:10.162
just, uh, going back
through my memories,

10:10.214 --> 10:13.715
on my own, prompted by no one,

10:13.801 --> 10:16.051
that, uh, one of those things was

10:16.137 --> 10:18.470
I never taught you how to drive.

10:18.506 --> 10:21.206
So I was thinking maybe I could
take you out for a lesson.

10:21.258 --> 10:23.296
Wait, you want to take me
out for a driving lesson?

10:23.344 --> 10:25.928
Yeah, why not? Give us a chance to bond.

10:26.013 --> 10:30.766
Who-who is this guy?

10:30.851 --> 10:34.386
It's like the opposite
of a zombie movie.

10:34.438 --> 10:38.056
He got bit and turned into a human.

10:38.109 --> 10:39.858
You know what, Dad,

10:39.910 --> 10:41.243
that's actually a really nice offer.

10:41.328 --> 10:42.727
Let's do it tomorrow.

10:42.780 --> 10:44.729
It'll be interesting
to have you teach me

10:44.782 --> 10:46.832
something legal, for once.

10:46.867 --> 10:49.234
Yeah. I'm glad I stopped by.

10:49.286 --> 10:51.236
It's true what they say.
Good things happen

10:51.288 --> 10:52.454
when you put yourself out there.

10:52.540 --> 10:54.756
Have a nice day, everybody.

10:54.842 --> 10:56.208
Even you.

11:00.214 --> 11:02.414
Okay, now, son,

11:02.466 --> 11:04.850
if you can dance in front
of a teenage girl...

11:06.470 --> 11:09.521
...the most notoriously judgmental
creature on the Earth...

11:11.225 --> 11:13.225
...you can dance at your wedding.

11:14.309 --> 11:17.779
Okay, Shannon, do you swear
to watch this dance rehearsal

11:17.865 --> 11:19.097
and heckle as needed?

11:19.150 --> 11:21.033
Walter, it would be my honor.

11:21.981 --> 11:23.735
Dad, I don't think I can do this.

11:23.787 --> 11:25.770
It's one thing in the kitchen, but here,

11:25.823 --> 11:28.373
under the bright lights
of the living room...

11:28.409 --> 11:29.608
too much pressure.

11:29.660 --> 11:31.627
You can do this, son.

11:31.712 --> 11:34.246
Shannon, are you ready to insult?

11:34.298 --> 11:35.666
Literally always.

11:36.834 --> 11:39.117
And a five, six, seven, eight...

11:39.170 --> 11:42.004
You forgot one through four, genius.

11:42.089 --> 11:43.422
Insult him, not me.

11:50.814 --> 11:53.065
Is this a Mets game? 'Cause you <i> suck!</i>

11:54.852 --> 11:57.102
What is this, Bambi on ice?

11:59.273 --> 12:01.106
Power through, son. Power through.

12:01.158 --> 12:03.575
I'm dying slowly inside.

12:04.099 --> 12:05.486
So am I.

12:08.867 --> 12:12.918
Okay, you got your hands
at ten and two. That's great.

12:12.953 --> 12:15.987
Now, don't be afraid to give
it just a little more gas,

12:16.040 --> 12:19.157
aka, any gas at all.

12:19.210 --> 12:21.126
I'm just a little nervous.

12:21.178 --> 12:24.680
Understood. But we were just
passed by a very plump beagle.

12:25.700 --> 12:29.334
Okay, did you just slow down even more?

12:29.386 --> 12:33.117
- This is a two-ton killing machine.
- Well, so is that beagle,

12:33.152 --> 12:35.524
but he's got some pep in his step.

12:35.609 --> 12:38.610
Okay, I'm sorry, Dad, but this is
as fast as I'm comfortable going.

12:38.646 --> 12:41.396
I get it. Baby steps. Wait.

12:42.288 --> 12:44.399
- Oh, my God, that's the guy.
- What guy?

12:44.485 --> 12:45.617
The guy that cut off all the heads.

12:45.653 --> 12:46.902
Right there in the blue Kia. Follow him!

12:46.987 --> 12:48.370
He's going too fast.

12:48.455 --> 12:50.205
Don't think, just drive.

12:50.291 --> 12:51.573
What happens if we catch him?

12:51.659 --> 12:52.824
We try to apprehend him.

12:52.876 --> 12:55.077
If he swings an axe or anything, duck.

12:56.550 --> 12:57.496
Now step on it!

13:02.586 --> 13:04.052
Finally.

13:04.138 --> 13:06.505
Actual proof that you're a virgin.

13:06.557 --> 13:09.675
All right, all right, all right.
I am done!

13:09.727 --> 13:10.976
No more. No. No.

13:11.011 --> 13:13.228
No!

13:13.314 --> 13:15.931
You can't stop in the middle of a salsa.

13:16.016 --> 13:18.883
That's how Charo tore her ACL.

13:18.936 --> 13:23.238
Nick, there is absolutely no
reason for you to be embarrassed.

13:23.324 --> 13:25.907
Nick, there absolutely is.

13:28.144 --> 13:30.028
Got some sneakers.

13:30.080 --> 13:33.064
Had an awkward run-in with
my ex-lover Sebastian.

13:33.117 --> 13:34.449
We're all good now.

13:35.920 --> 13:37.336
What happened to the furniture?

13:37.371 --> 13:39.421
I swear to God, if you people
threw a party without me...

13:39.506 --> 13:40.789
No, no, no. No, Ben, there was no party.

13:40.874 --> 13:42.291
They're just trying to
help me get over my fear

13:42.376 --> 13:43.542
of dancing at the wedding.

13:43.594 --> 13:44.743
Which is useless.

13:44.795 --> 13:47.245
Okay? Just forget it. I'm-I'm done.

13:47.298 --> 13:48.580
What? No.

13:48.632 --> 13:51.183
No. I may not be that
good of a maid of honor,

13:51.218 --> 13:53.135
but this means a lot to Clem,

13:53.220 --> 13:55.220
so I'm gonna help you get through this.

13:56.408 --> 13:57.389
Even though when you dance,

13:57.441 --> 14:00.642
you look like a goat
in zero gravity, I'm sorry.

14:00.728 --> 14:02.894
Nicky, Nicky, this is so easy to fix.

14:02.946 --> 14:04.563
Watch and learn. Give me a beat, daddy.

14:15.209 --> 14:17.108
How is this supposed to help?

14:17.161 --> 14:18.660
You're even worse than Nick.

14:18.746 --> 14:19.995
I know, but I don't care.

14:20.080 --> 14:21.880
If you're having fun,
you're a great dancer,

14:21.915 --> 14:23.298
even if you're a terrible dancer.

14:23.384 --> 14:26.752
I call it the "Ellen Theory."

14:28.422 --> 14:30.339
Come on, join me, Nicky.

14:30.959 --> 14:32.474
Sure, why the hell not?

14:35.383 --> 14:36.561
Dip me.

14:39.183 --> 14:41.299
That's it, son. You're free!

14:48.467 --> 14:49.491
I don't know if I can keep up
with him, Dad.

14:49.576 --> 14:50.909
He's going too fast.

14:50.944 --> 14:52.644
Of course he's going
fast. The fever's got him.

14:52.696 --> 14:54.946
He needs more heads,
and he needs 'em now.

14:54.998 --> 14:57.282
Oh, God, he's pulling over.

14:58.481 --> 15:01.670
And wait, he's...

15:01.755 --> 15:03.755
an old lady?

15:04.278 --> 15:06.508
What, only a man can be a mass murderer?

15:06.593 --> 15:09.809
You know, it's that kind of attitude
that's holding women back.

15:10.964 --> 15:13.465
She's not the killer, is she?

15:13.517 --> 15:15.100
You were thinking too much.

15:15.135 --> 15:16.635
I had to get you out of your head.

15:16.687 --> 15:18.970
And it worked, didn't it? You drove.

15:19.022 --> 15:21.005
Yeah, I did.

15:21.058 --> 15:23.558
Oh, my God, I drove!

15:24.115 --> 15:27.312
That's a pretty nice
father-daughter moment, huh?

15:27.929 --> 15:30.148
Yeah. It was.

15:30.200 --> 15:33.485
You know, you may want to,
uh, mention that to Rose.

15:33.537 --> 15:35.070
Why would I mention that...

15:35.155 --> 15:37.155
Oh. I get it.

15:37.207 --> 15:39.040
This is just so that
she'll sign your form.

15:39.126 --> 15:40.826
So what if it is? I get what I want.

15:40.878 --> 15:42.377
You get what you want. It's a win-win.

15:42.463 --> 15:44.924
What I want is an actual father.

15:44.949 --> 15:47.532
I can't believe I fell for this...
again.

15:47.584 --> 15:48.633
I'm such an idiot.

15:48.669 --> 15:50.535
Oh, come on, sweetie,
you're not an idiot.

15:50.587 --> 15:51.887
You're just dyslexic.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.725
I need to stop hoping
that you're gonna change.

15:56.810 --> 15:58.560
Come on, Clem, I'm your dad.

15:58.645 --> 16:02.431
Barely. You're just the guy
who had sex with my mom.

16:02.516 --> 16:05.851
And Shannon's mom, and probably
a lot of other people's moms.

16:06.630 --> 16:07.769
Clem!

16:07.855 --> 16:10.489
Clem, at least let me drive you home!

16:10.524 --> 16:12.741
There really is a guy
chopping heads out there!

16:12.826 --> 16:15.944
We tell the public we have leads;
we have no leads!

16:22.686 --> 16:24.635
- Oh. Hey, babe.
- Hey.

16:26.156 --> 16:27.689
How was your driving lesson with Freddy?

16:27.757 --> 16:30.124
Well, it started off with
me thinking I was gonna

16:30.193 --> 16:32.694
get my head chopped off,
and ended with me

16:32.762 --> 16:35.363
wishing that I had my head chopped off.

16:36.419 --> 16:37.198
You okay?

16:37.233 --> 16:38.783
I don't want to talk about it.

16:38.868 --> 16:41.936
The moral of the story
is people don't change.

16:41.988 --> 16:44.105
Well, the moral of this story is,

16:44.157 --> 16:46.290
uh, yeah, they do.

16:51.748 --> 16:54.999
Oh, my God, Nick, what's all this?

16:57.162 --> 16:59.220
Play dance mix.

16:59.255 --> 17:01.140
Calling Dan Minsk.

17:01.175 --> 17:02.293
Damn it.

17:04.644 --> 17:06.145
Stop. Bad phone.

17:06.396 --> 17:08.628
Nick?

17:08.681 --> 17:10.598
Dan. Hey, man, uh,
it's been a long time.

17:10.650 --> 17:11.816
Long time.

17:11.901 --> 17:14.421
Let me guess.
Trying to play a dance mix?

17:14.455 --> 17:15.970
You got it.
All right, got to go, man. Bye.

17:18.108 --> 17:21.108
I'll just do this the old-fashioned way.

17:22.685 --> 17:23.944
Ooh.

17:27.135 --> 17:28.185
Ooh.

17:29.703 --> 17:31.285
Oh. Nick?

17:37.627 --> 17:39.544
Nick, what is going on?

17:40.715 --> 17:43.681
I'm transporting you to Havana, Cuba.

17:45.301 --> 17:49.520
And giving you the wedding dance
that you've always dreamed of.

17:51.724 --> 17:52.690
Are you for real?

17:54.778 --> 17:57.445
May I have this dance...

17:57.480 --> 17:59.513
and every dance,

17:59.566 --> 18:00.865
for the rest of our lives?

18:01.493 --> 18:02.283
Yes!

18:08.241 --> 18:10.408
Oh, baby, look at these dance moves.

18:10.493 --> 18:11.909
Ooh,<i> en fuego.</i>

18:18.443 --> 18:19.700
Are you sure you're
gonna be able to do this

18:19.752 --> 18:21.702
in front of 250 people?

18:21.754 --> 18:23.504
Well, I did it in front of Shannon.

18:23.556 --> 18:24.538
Oh, well, then, you're good.

18:24.591 --> 18:25.723
Yeah.

18:32.726 --> 18:35.013
Shannon, I cannot believe
I'm going to say this,

18:35.098 --> 18:39.901
but thank you so much for
tormenting my fiancé.

18:40.915 --> 18:44.072
Anytime.

18:44.107 --> 18:45.356
Whether he wants it or not.

18:47.110 --> 18:48.609
Clem, sweetheart,

18:48.662 --> 18:51.079
I am so sorry that I
was not able to make

18:51.114 --> 18:53.031
real progress with your father.

18:53.116 --> 18:56.817
I was so sure that if he had a
genuine father-daughter moment,

18:56.870 --> 18:58.419
that he'd be hungry for more.

18:58.455 --> 19:01.005
Rose... I hate to say I told you so,

19:01.091 --> 19:04.959
but, as you know,
I was raised very poorly, so...

19:05.011 --> 19:06.627
I told you so.

19:07.804 --> 19:10.831
I just was so sure that I
could get through to him.

19:11.430 --> 19:14.268
Aw, heck, now I just got
to order new business cards

19:14.304 --> 19:17.838
that say, "One of the best
damn therapists in New York."

19:22.445 --> 19:23.511
Hello, Clem.

19:23.563 --> 19:25.679
Dad. What do you want?

19:25.732 --> 19:29.701
Wow. Does not hurt less with repetition.

19:29.786 --> 19:30.702
Hello, everybody.

19:30.787 --> 19:31.869
- Hey.
- Hi, Dad.

19:31.955 --> 19:33.654
- Hey, Freddy.
- Not you.

19:35.158 --> 19:38.910
Look, Clem,
when you said that thing in the car,

19:38.995 --> 19:40.995
it really made me think.

19:41.047 --> 19:45.249
I don't want to be just a guy
that had sex with your mom.

19:45.834 --> 19:46.718
And your mom.

19:48.922 --> 19:53.040
I want to be a dad...
who had sex with your mom.

19:53.936 --> 19:56.877
Well, it's not exactly a Hallmark card,

19:56.930 --> 19:58.546
but it's not nothing.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.098
I mean it.

20:00.183 --> 20:02.383
In fact, I had
such a nice time with you,

20:02.435 --> 20:04.318
I-I started to think maybe I should be

20:04.354 --> 20:06.387
in my daughters' lives a little more.

20:06.439 --> 20:08.156
Booyah!

20:09.743 --> 20:13.745
Ha ha! I told <i> you</i> so.

20:13.830 --> 20:15.896
Hey, I deserve a little credit.

20:15.949 --> 20:18.232
I laid down the daughter
guilt pretty hard.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.835
Let us not forget about
the guy chopping heads.

20:20.870 --> 20:24.872
I mean, it all started with him.

20:25.786 --> 20:29.010
Yeah, he's the real hero here.

20:29.598 --> 20:32.847
If we ever catch him,
I'm gonna shake that man's hand.

20:34.717 --> 20:37.385
So, is this what families do?

20:37.437 --> 20:40.188
You all hang out and
stare at each other?

20:43.548 --> 20:45.526
How long do we sit here for?
