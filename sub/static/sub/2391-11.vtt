FOR THE MAYOR

YOUR DAD WAS BUSTED TRYING
TO BUY AN EIGHT BALL

05:59.820 --> 06:02.380
FROM AN UNDERCOVER COP
AT AN EAGLES CONCERT IN '74.

06:02.390 --> 06:03.982

AND A COLLISION ON HER RECORD
BEFORE SHE GRADUATED.

06:06.760 --> 06:10.924

I HEAR YOU CAN DIG UP DIRT

06:19.780 --> 06:23.102
THE FIRST TWO VICTIMS,
CATHERINE WILLS, ANDREA SIMMS,

06:23.110 --> 06:25.749
WERE FOUND IN 2001 AND 2002,

IN THEIR BLOOD,

HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

07:24.670 --> 07:27.002
WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT THE KILLER?

07:27.010 --> 07:30.138
HE HATES WOMEN,
CRAVES ATTENTION, HE'S A LOSER.

07:31.580 --> 07:34.572
THE WEEKEND KILLINGS
SUGGEST THAT THE GUY
HAS A TRADITIONAL JOB.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.070
AMY POLK WAS FOUND

07:36.080 --> 07:38.241

SOME LOCAL BARS ON HER WRIST

07:38.250 --> 07:39.683

FOR EMANCIPATION WHEN SHE WAS 16

07:49.300 --> 07:50.562
AND THEN MOVED TO HOLLYWOOD.

07:50.570 --> 07:52.367
ACCORDING TO THE
INTERNET MOVIE DATABASE,

07:52.370 --> 07:55.862
SHE WENT ON TO PLAY SUCH ROLES
AS TRUCKER'S GIRLFRIEND,

07:55.870 --> 08:00.239
SCREAMING MAID,
AND BI-CURIOUS ROOMMATE.

08:02.810 --> 08:06.371
YOUR MOTHER WAS MARRIED
IN 1985 FOR 36 DAYS.

08:06.380 --> 08:09.611
SHUT UP!
TO A PRO SKIER SHE
MET ON SPRING BREAK.

08:09.620 --> 08:12.418

08:38.010 --> 08:40.717
THAT'S NOTHING COMPARED

08:40.720 --> 08:44.178
IT'S TIME TO THINK GLOBAL
AND ACT LOCAL.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.319
OKAY.

08:48.320 --> 08:51.756

DOUBLE THE FEE,

08:53.800 --> 08:57.190

BOUGHT THE DOMAIN NAME.

08:59.900 --> 09:02.368
WITH YOUR SLEUTH PROWESS

THINK ABOUT IT.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.329
THERE IS JUST
ONE MORE THING,

09:24.330 --> 09:26.286
ABOUT MY FOLKS
I WAS WONDERING ABOUT.

09:26.290 --> 09:28.758
YOU P.I.s HAVE ACCESS
TO SEARCH ENGINES

09:28.760 --> 09:31.092
THAT WOULD TAKE ME WEEKS
TO HACK INTO, SO...

09:31.100 --> 09:32.636
