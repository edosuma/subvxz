'The new, hotly anticipated
Grand Theft Auto is being released today.

00:04.213 --> 00:07.861
'And fans are revved up,
and gearing up to buy it.

00:07.934 --> 00:13.909
'Set in 1980s Miami, Vice City lets
you be a gangster in your own home.

00:13.910 --> 00:18.694
'And promises to be as colourful and
controversial as its predecessors.'

00:18.702 --> 00:22.689
'Yes, as for the seminal
Grand Theft Auto III,

00:22.690 --> 00:24.721
'the question game watchers
are asking is,

00:24.722 --> 00:27.050
'can Sam Houser's
Rockstar Games pull off

00:27.063 --> 00:29.079
'making the most
successful game ever,

00:29.111 --> 00:32.003
'twice, in the space of one year?'

00:32.369 --> 00:34.393
'You're listening to WYNZ,

and best radio station.

'Expectation is sky-high,
but just how good is it?

00:52.189 --> 00:56.156
'Let's take a call. I've got Newark's
Phil Lombard on the line.'

00:56.157 --> 01:00.160
'Hey, Sam Houser is a genius, man.
This game is beautiful.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.180
'I bought it at midnight.

01:01.181 --> 01:03.197
'I had to stand in line
for four hours to get it.

01:11.145 --> 01:14.152
'I have been playing it
ever since. It is huge.

01:14.153 --> 01:17.156
'They've recreated
the whole of 1980s Miami.

01:17.157 --> 01:20.112
'They've made a living,
breathing city.

01:20.113 --> 01:23.105
'There is a great storyline
this time, amazing visuals,

01:23.236 --> 01:25.311
'loads of kick-ass
'80s radio stations,

01:25.312 --> 01:27.299
'and a huge number
of cool missions.'

01:27.300 --> 01:29.287
'Sounds great.'
'It is, Steve.

01:29.288 --> 01:32.263
'But what makes it genius is
the size of the gameplay area.

01:32.264 --> 01:33.319
'And the detail.

01:33.320 --> 01:36.311
'GTA III was seminal.
It changed the whole of gaming.

01:36.312 --> 01:38.279
'I think this one is even better.'

01:38.280 --> 01:42.235
'Phil, I'm going to let you
get back to playing with yourself.

'Hello, Peggy, is that right?
You're up...'

01:52.296 --> 01:55.283
Terry.

01:55.284 --> 01:57.291
Have you seen the figures?

01:57.292 --> 01:59.327
We've sold a million units.

01:59.328 --> 02:01.303
A million.

02:01.304 --> 02:03.328
In one fucking day.

02:05.304 --> 02:07.268
Aaaaargh!

<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

02:20.320 --> 02:23.331
So whatever we do next, we have
to take it to the next level.

02:23.332 --> 02:26.267
I know we are all excited about
how Vice City has done,

02:26.268 --> 02:30.251
but EA are breathing down our necks
and we have demanding fans.

02:30.252 --> 02:34.291
So, I want to create a world full
of incredible realistic detail

02:34.292 --> 02:36.303
that evokes real emotions
in the players.

02:36.304 --> 02:37.327
Far more than we did in Vice.

02:37.328 --> 02:40.315
Take-Two are expecting
the next GTA within a year,

02:40.316 --> 02:43.247
by which they mean nine months.
We can do this in a year.

02:43.248 --> 02:45.307
I had to discourage about 50
people from leaving every week.

02:45.308 --> 02:48.311
We can't put everyone through that
again. Well, so we hire more people.

02:48.312 --> 02:52.303
Boyz N The Hood. Menace II Society.
Colors, I want a fucking cool vibe.

02:52.304 --> 02:56.267
That is the world we're in.
South-Central LA. Compton and Watts.

02:56.268 --> 02:58.283
A black hood game?
Those barrios are vibe.

02:58.284 --> 03:01.263
You remember when the Crips and
Bloods were fighting in the '80s?

03:01.264 --> 03:03.315
We can't make a game about that.
Why not? We are British.

03:03.316 --> 03:05.255
We know nothing about it.

03:05.256 --> 03:08.267
Hey, look, we're good at making
games about American culture

03:08.268 --> 03:10.251
because we grew up absorbed in it.

03:10.252 --> 03:12.271
But you're talking about
a real American conflict.

03:12.272 --> 03:15.271
Exactly, something real that is
not just an iteration of a TV show

03:15.272 --> 03:19.279
or a film. Because we are outsiders,
we see America for what it is.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.240
Better than they do.

03:27.264 --> 03:29.332
There she is. The successful wife.

03:33.276 --> 03:37.264
I got us Italian. Oh, great.
I am starving. Long day.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.283
Johnny. Dinner.

03:46.284 --> 03:49.295
May the Lord bless this meal
and grant us a compassionate

03:49.296 --> 03:54.303
and understanding heart, in
Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen.

03:54.304 --> 03:57.276
All right. This looks good. Yeah!

04:20.327 --> 04:24.315
Listen, I'm going to need your help
with this. We need to push it.

04:24.316 --> 04:26.311
Now, we need to be
careful, though, Sam.

04:26.312 --> 04:29.251
You know, finishing Vice City
nearly killed everyone.

04:29.252 --> 04:32.243
If we go bigger, it is going to be
harder. It is not just about scale.

04:32.244 --> 04:35.303
Come on, little brother.
You are the clever, funny one.

04:35.304 --> 04:38.292
We need new ideas to move us on.

04:42.272 --> 04:44.279
So, if you want to push boundaries,

04:44.280 --> 04:47.279
we should have a black
lead character.

04:47.280 --> 04:51.263
Yeah, great idea.
Yeah, let's take it black.

04:51.264 --> 04:55.319
Can you have a black lead in a game?
Has anyone done that? No. We will.

04:55.320 --> 04:59.295
Could we get Samuel L Jackson?
Yeah, I'm sure we could.

04:59.296 --> 05:00.327
You can get anyone.

05:00.328 --> 05:03.267
Film stars don't matter,
all right, forget film stars.

05:03.268 --> 05:05.323
This game has got to be something
that goes beyond film.

05:05.324 --> 05:07.307
It does something film can't do.

05:07.308 --> 05:12.252
How? I don't know, that is why
we are talking about it. Ooh!

05:15.244 --> 05:16.272
Hello?

05:18.260 --> 05:20.315
Well, hello, Margaret.
Of course I remember you.

05:20.316 --> 05:22.244
How can I help?

05:24.260 --> 05:25.300
Uh-huh.

05:28.252 --> 05:29.332
I see.

05:31.260 --> 05:34.295
Well, Margaret,
let me stop you there.

05:34.296 --> 05:36.287
It sounds to me like
the treatment you had

05:36.288 --> 05:38.275
may well be medical malpractice

05:38.276 --> 05:40.295
and, gee, I would love to help.

05:40.296 --> 05:42.331
But I don't think you should use me.

05:42.332 --> 05:45.267
I think you should speak to a lawyer

05:45.268 --> 05:47.296
who may be able to better
represent you.

05:49.320 --> 05:54.319
Well, to be frank, I've become
a little toxic as a lawyer.

05:54.320 --> 05:57.247
I got Howard Stern
and a 2 Live Crew rap album

05:57.248 --> 05:58.315
banned for violating obscenity laws

05:58.316 --> 06:01.319
and subsequently no-one
wants to be represented

06:01.320 --> 06:03.328
by a kooky moral campaigner.

06:05.240 --> 06:08.259
You should try my friend,
Frank Simpson. He is a good man.

06:08.260 --> 06:10.260
A fine advocate.

06:13.276 --> 06:16.280
Why do I do it? What can I say?

06:18.244 --> 06:19.308
Because I am Batman.

06:21.264 --> 06:25.252
Because for some reason,
God rose this asshole up to do good.

06:27.240 --> 06:31.280
Well, I appreciate the call.
All right. Goodnight.

07:00.300 --> 07:04.275
We just made the biggest
selling game in history!

07:04.276 --> 07:06.251
We've lined up the usual suspects

07:06.252 --> 07:07.323
for a cheese ball competition,

07:07.324 --> 07:10.299
so, if you want to be a rock star,
you have got to play the game.

07:10.300 --> 07:14.267
Right, now, listen up.
Last year's record was 68.

07:14.268 --> 07:16.271
Anyone who beats that,
you get the holiday

07:16.272 --> 07:18.319
and I will throw in
a triple pass, all right?

07:18.320 --> 07:20.251
Eat the cheese.

07:20.252 --> 07:24.319
Don't, don't... Oh, no, look.
That is disgusting. That is carnage.

07:24.320 --> 07:26.299
That is a cheese fondue right there.

07:26.300 --> 07:30.324
What? What is it?
I bought you something.

07:34.312 --> 07:40.247
It is the first TTS convertible
in America. What? For me?

07:40.248 --> 07:44.275
It's a thank you. For everything
you've done for Rockstar.

07:44.276 --> 07:45.324
And for me.

07:50.244 --> 07:54.244
You'll be too busy to ever drive it,
of course. Yeah, of course.

07:57.272 --> 08:01.331
Look, Vice City is good,
really good,

08:01.332 --> 08:03.295
but you and I know we are only

08:03.296 --> 08:06.263
just scratching the surface of
what these games can do now.

08:06.264 --> 08:07.287
And for the next one,

08:07.288 --> 08:10.299
I want to create a completely
real world, right? For grown-ups,

08:10.300 --> 08:15.235
where you don't have to become
a penguin or some shitty hairy elf.

08:15.236 --> 08:17.235
When people talk about video games

08:17.236 --> 08:20.291
the way they talk about
films and music, Jamie,

08:20.292 --> 08:22.260
that is when we have done it.

08:25.244 --> 08:26.304
Enjoy that.

08:30.296 --> 08:33.279
'A blue Pontiac,
registered stolen

08:33.280 --> 08:36.259
'this evening at 23:00 hours,

08:36.260 --> 08:42.251
'license plate 0093,

08:49.260 --> 08:51.279
'Officers Spencer and Watt

'appears to be a trauma injury...'

09:07.240 --> 09:12.316
What is your full name, please,
Devin? I need your full name, son.

09:16.312 --> 09:19.283
Devin Darnell Moore.

09:19.284 --> 09:22.292
Darnell Moore. Date of birth?

09:26.244 --> 09:30.324
Look, son, you are in a lot of
trouble, you need to start helping.

09:35.268 --> 09:38.296
OK. Let's do your fingerprints.

09:53.288 --> 09:55.280
He's got a gun!

09:57.316 --> 09:59.255
What's going on?

09:59.256 --> 10:00.327
Ace, Ace, we got a fucking problem!

10:00.328 --> 10:02.268
Jesus!

11:18.248 --> 11:21.244
Honey, there's a muffin for you here.

11:26.268 --> 11:28.280
We leave in five minutes, OK?

11:38.264 --> 11:40.307
I've got lacrosse tonight, Dad.

11:40.308 --> 11:45.252
Can you pick me up at seven?
What's that? Lacrosse. Tonight.

11:53.252 --> 11:55.255
Fayette, Alabama, please.

11:55.256 --> 11:58.271
Can I get the number
of the Fayette police station?

11:58.272 --> 12:00.331
You know how in traditional
role-playing games you can

12:00.332 --> 12:03.275
train yourself to be
a better shitty swordsman,

12:03.276 --> 12:05.279
or do better shitty
little goblin spells?

12:05.280 --> 12:08.307
Our hero, Carl, should be able
to improve himself too.

12:08.308 --> 12:10.255
Like, to change.

12:10.256 --> 12:12.243
So you can make him
thinner, or fatter,

12:12.244 --> 12:15.239
or sexier, or stronger, you know.
You can change him. Morning, Jamie.

12:15.240 --> 12:17.319
People have been able to do
that in RPGs for a while.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.323
Yes, but that is always
to help you complete

12:19.324 --> 12:21.251
some sort of narrow mission.

12:21.252 --> 12:23.299
All right, now we're going
to offer the players the chance

12:23.300 --> 12:25.319
to adapt themselves as they go.
Shape themselves.

12:25.320 --> 12:29.259
Not because they need to for the
game, just because they want to.

12:29.260 --> 12:31.291
All right, so if you want Carl
to get a haircut, you can.

12:31.292 --> 12:34.267
If you want him to go and get new
threads, you just go and buy them.

12:34.268 --> 12:36.327
And then doing these things will
change how other characters

12:36.328 --> 12:39.287
relate to you in the game.
But if it's not linked to missions,

12:39.288 --> 12:42.247
won't all that feel a bit
irrelevant and super nerdy?

12:42.248 --> 12:43.263
No, I don't think so.

12:43.264 --> 12:44.311
I think it will make people feel

12:44.312 --> 12:47.243
incredibly emotionally
linked to Carl.

12:47.244 --> 12:49.255
You are the hero. The hero is you.

12:49.256 --> 12:54.259
OK, Terry, if you could send Carl to
get a haircut - go and get dreads -

12:54.260 --> 12:57.251
would that not feel good?
Ha-fucking-ha.

12:57.252 --> 13:00.295
Jen, you want a tattoo?
Via Carl, you can go and get one.

13:00.296 --> 13:04.239
Jamie, you want a six pack.
You can get one. Got one.

13:04.240 --> 13:07.319
Dan, you want to have sex,
via Carl, finally, you can.

13:07.320 --> 13:12.303
If you make Carl attractive enough,
somebody should have sex with him.

13:12.304 --> 13:14.319
This is beyond what film can do.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.315
Guys, we're going
to create the first

13:16.316 --> 13:19.324
truly adaptable hero
across any art-form.

13:40.296 --> 13:45.327
Devin, my name is Jack Thompson. I am
an attorney at law based in Miami.

13:45.328 --> 13:48.323
I am very sorry about
the situation you are in.

13:48.324 --> 13:53.280
I'd like to understand how it
happened. Why it happened.

13:55.316 --> 13:58.319
When they arrested you
in Mississippi, apparently you said,

13:58.320 --> 14:02.311
"Life is like a video game,
you have got to die sometime."

14:02.312 --> 14:04.296
Is that what you said?

14:12.280 --> 14:14.327
Who are you?

14:14.328 --> 14:16.292
He doesn't know why he did it.

14:17.312 --> 14:21.268
He said it was like a flashback,
like he was playing the game.

14:22.292 --> 14:26.296
He is just a sweet, stupid lost kid.
He got arrested and he panicked.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.307
I just don't believe
he would have killed those men

14:30.308 --> 14:33.259
if he had not spent hours a day
practising doing exactly

14:33.260 --> 14:35.291
the same thing in that
cop killer game.

14:35.292 --> 14:38.259
You don't know it was the game
that made him act that way.

14:38.260 --> 14:39.311
But it WAS the game.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.303
He is still guilty of murder.

14:41.304 --> 14:45.268
Yes, he is,
and nothing will change that.

14:46.280 --> 14:47.327
Come on, you're a lawyer.

14:47.328 --> 14:51.300
I think the people that make these
games are partly responsible.

14:52.300 --> 14:55.243
I mean, think about it.

14:55.244 --> 14:58.307
They're drenching our children
in depravity and violence,

14:58.308 --> 15:01.307
training our kids to be killers
and making money out of it.

15:01.308 --> 15:05.327
They... They make an entertainment
that normalises horrendous violence.

15:05.328 --> 15:07.308
It makes me sick.

15:10.312 --> 15:13.235
You're going to fight them.

15:13.236 --> 15:15.267
You don't think I should?

15:15.268 --> 15:16.331
I feel compelled to.

15:16.332 --> 15:20.283
We're raising a generation of kids
steeped in sex and violence

15:20.284 --> 15:22.304
and no-one's doing anything about it.

15:24.248 --> 15:27.272
I think this is what's
required of me.

15:38.236 --> 15:41.279
This is vibe.

15:41.280 --> 15:44.255
Very cheery.

15:44.256 --> 15:47.247
Yeah,
this is what I'm talking about.

15:47.248 --> 15:49.331
Get video of every
street around here, Jamie.

15:49.332 --> 15:52.319
Is it safe?
Yeah, get filming, it's fine.

15:52.320 --> 15:55.259
Hiya.

15:55.260 --> 15:56.263
Lookin' real good.

15:56.264 --> 15:58.295
We should get the
programmers down here too

15:58.296 --> 16:01.311
so they can see it for themselves,
iterate on it.

16:01.312 --> 16:03.316
The streets speak to you. Whoo!

16:05.296 --> 16:07.267
I feel very English.

16:07.268 --> 16:08.327
You don't look it.

16:08.328 --> 16:12.271
You look like a bad... shit mother!

16:12.272 --> 16:13.316
You know what I'm saying?

16:14.316 --> 16:17.247
Are we... hoping to see a drive-by?

16:17.248 --> 16:18.299
Do you mind if I don't film that?

16:18.300 --> 16:20.327
We should get the programmers
firing some guns too,

16:20.328 --> 16:23.236
so they know how they
sound and feel.

16:42.256 --> 16:44.287
Who are you?
Hey, my man, don't sweat it.

16:44.288 --> 16:47.248
These are English fellas
I'm showing around.

16:48.308 --> 16:51.259
Why you got that rip
in your jeans, boy?

16:51.260 --> 16:52.311
Is that a Crip thing?

16:52.312 --> 16:54.303
Is it?
I'm not a Crip, I promise you.

16:54.304 --> 16:55.311
By cool, these are...

16:55.312 --> 16:58.283
Do not tell me to be cool, nigga!

16:58.284 --> 17:01.235
I'll decide when I'mma be cool.
Who are you?

17:01.236 --> 17:03.243
I'm DJ Dog from South Park, man.

17:03.244 --> 17:05.299
These fellas are just here
doing research on a game.

17:05.300 --> 17:07.291
They make Grand Theft Auto.

17:11.252 --> 17:12.296
Y'all make GTA?

17:15.268 --> 17:17.276
Y'all some Rockstars.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.282
Yo, I love that game!
I play it for hours!

17:20.284 --> 17:23.303
Tell them I play it for hours.
Don't I play it for hours? Hmm-hmm.

17:23.304 --> 17:26.323
Yo... Y'all want to make
a game around here?

17:26.324 --> 17:29.251
Yeah, a game that's set here.
Maybe you could help us.

17:29.252 --> 17:30.311
Like, can I be in it?

17:30.312 --> 17:33.331
Like, I'm a performer, I've got
my own record label and I'm an actor.

17:33.332 --> 17:35.287
Yeah, man, what's your name?

17:35.288 --> 17:37.267
And where do you get your jewellery?

17:37.268 --> 17:38.327
I'll show you. OK.

17:38.328 --> 17:40.272
Good.

17:45.324 --> 17:48.243
Carl's got this girl
he's dating in the game.

17:48.244 --> 17:49.263
Denise, we said.

17:49.264 --> 17:50.279
Denise, right.

17:50.280 --> 17:53.271
Oh, 21-11. Next gangster.

17:53.272 --> 17:55.291
You should be able to take
her on different dates,

17:55.292 --> 17:57.263
do stuff that affects
the relationship

17:57.264 --> 17:58.279
and how she behaves to you,

17:58.280 --> 18:00.327
like in real life.
Come on then, Houser.

18:00.328 --> 18:02.243
I'm gonna take you down.

18:02.244 --> 18:05.247
Be able to take her to bars or
out driving, buy her flowers.

18:05.248 --> 18:07.323
Can you take her on a drive-by?
Some girls would love that.

18:07.324 --> 18:10.243
Ho-ho!
What was that, Jamie?

18:10.244 --> 18:12.267
And I want a proper sex scene
this time round.

18:12.268 --> 18:13.279
A full-on sex scene.

18:13.280 --> 18:16.263
If you treat Denise right, she'll
have sex with you. It's only fair.

18:16.264 --> 18:18.283
You can't put a sex scene
in a game, Sam. Yes, you can.

18:18.284 --> 18:20.283
Why not? Sex is a part of life.

18:20.284 --> 18:23.268
Films and music tackle sex
all the time - why can't we?

18:25.312 --> 18:27.324
2-0, wanker.

18:49.312 --> 18:50.331
Oh, Ray, sorry I'm late.

18:50.332 --> 18:52.315
I had a hell of a time
finding the place.

18:52.316 --> 18:55.267
No problem. We're all here.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.311
My friend Ray here is
an excellent trial lawyer.

18:57.312 --> 19:01.243
He believes as strongly as I do
that Rockstar and Sony are,

19:01.244 --> 19:04.303
to some degree, responsible
for the deaths of your loved ones.

19:04.304 --> 19:08.259
We believe what Devin did
was an impulsive act,

19:08.260 --> 19:11.307
made more likely due to the fact
that he played a violent video game

19:11.308 --> 19:13.271
for weeks beforehand.

19:13.272 --> 19:18.299
And we're gathering a handful of
expert witnesses to testify in court

19:18.300 --> 19:23.247
that there is a clear link between
teenagers playing violent games

19:23.248 --> 19:24.312
and violent behaviour.

19:25.320 --> 19:28.259
You saying that the game's
responsible for his actions,

19:28.260 --> 19:30.300
that will let Devin off the hook,
won't it?

19:32.252 --> 19:34.243
I don't know about the others here,

19:34.244 --> 19:36.279
but I want that boy
to face up to what he did.

19:36.280 --> 19:38.260
I want him on death row.

19:40.260 --> 19:43.259
We don't believe what Devin
did was premeditated.

19:43.260 --> 19:45.247
You don't know it wasn't.

19:45.248 --> 19:46.271
No, I don't.

19:46.272 --> 19:49.299
I'm not saying he's not responsible
for what he did - he is -

19:49.300 --> 19:52.239
and he will face that
in a criminal court.

19:52.240 --> 19:55.323
Our civil case isn't
designed to get him off,

19:55.324 --> 19:57.327
but we want the makers
of these obscene games

19:57.328 --> 20:00.331
to take some responsibility and
help stop other police officers

20:00.332 --> 20:05.328
from being killed in the same way
that James and Arnold and Ace were.

20:07.304 --> 20:09.283
Don't you want that too?

20:09.284 --> 20:13.255
And we want you to have
some form of compensation...

20:13.256 --> 20:14.327
for your loss.

20:14.328 --> 20:16.327
You think you can win?

20:16.328 --> 20:18.303
We will win, I promise you,

20:18.304 --> 20:21.287
because I will fight this as hard
as I've ever fought anything

20:21.288 --> 20:24.315
and because I believe what
Martin Luther King said -

20:24.316 --> 20:29.308
"The arc of history is long,
but it bends towards justice."

20:33.236 --> 20:36.299
This lawsuit will put the video game
industry on trial.

20:36.300 --> 20:40.279
Strickland versus Sony, the makers
of PlayStation and Rockstar Games,

20:40.280 --> 20:42.319
the makers of Grand Theft Auto

20:42.320 --> 20:46.251
is a lawsuit designed to make every
police officer in America safer.

20:46.252 --> 20:48.331
How much are you seeking in damages?

20:48.332 --> 20:51.255
600 million for the families.

20:51.256 --> 20:52.303
Isn't that excessive?

20:52.304 --> 20:54.279
I don't think so.

20:54.280 --> 20:57.328
We're going to destroy Rockstar
Games, you can count on that.

21:01.300 --> 21:06.275
Listen, there's some born-again
Christian nutbag lawyer in Florida

21:06.276 --> 21:08.239
bringing a civil case against us

21:08.240 --> 21:10.283
for that supposed copycat
killing in Alabama.

21:10.284 --> 21:12.236
For what Devin Moore did?

21:15.308 --> 21:17.251
Are Take-Two worried about?

21:17.252 --> 21:21.275
No. It's America -
it's ligation-crazy.

21:21.276 --> 21:24.239
They've put their lawyers on it,
you don't have to do anything,

21:24.240 --> 21:26.311
but you should be aware of it,
that's all.

21:26.312 --> 21:29.243
OK.

21:29.244 --> 21:31.251
I'm aware.

21:31.252 --> 21:32.308
OK, good.

21:34.324 --> 21:37.256
Coming to play ping pong? Sure.

21:38.300 --> 21:40.260
What's this lawyer's name?

22:01.288 --> 22:05.264
How long have you been playing
that game? Jesus, Patty!

22:06.288 --> 22:09.291
I didn't pick you up, I'm sorry.
Oh, that's OK.

22:09.292 --> 22:11.247
It's not what it looks like.

22:11.248 --> 22:13.327
I just thought I'd better
exactly understand

22:13.328 --> 22:15.323
what it is I'm objecting to.

22:15.324 --> 22:18.271
It's unbelievable.
From the moment you start playing,

22:18.272 --> 22:21.283
it encourages you to hurt people
and you start doing it.

22:21.284 --> 22:23.239
It's disturbing.

22:23.240 --> 22:25.307
I mean, how dare these people
make this depraved garbage

22:25.308 --> 22:28.299
and force it on our children.
Yes, Jack.

22:28.300 --> 22:32.283
A disgusting picture of America
made by some Brits.

22:32.284 --> 22:35.272
I really wish ill on the people
who make this filth.

23:00.324 --> 23:02.284
Who are you?

23:09.304 --> 23:12.320
Perfect. Cheers, man.

23:16.312 --> 23:18.327
What's that? A T-shirt I bought.

23:18.328 --> 23:20.331
It's a list of all
the pharmaceutical drugs

23:20.332 --> 23:23.247
found in Dom Simpson's blood
system when he died.

23:23.248 --> 23:25.331
He's not the greatest film producer
ever - that's James Cameron.

23:25.332 --> 23:27.331
Cameron's a director,
not a producer.

23:27.332 --> 23:31.291
Simpson produced Top Gun, Bad Boys
and Beverly Hills Cop.

23:31.292 --> 23:34.239
End of.
Don't forget Flashdance.

23:34.240 --> 23:36.323
It's not even just what he produced,
it's how he produced it.

23:36.324 --> 23:38.323
Unashamed to be populist
and entertaining.

23:38.324 --> 23:41.307
Never compromised and basically
invented the action comedy.

23:41.308 --> 23:44.259
Hey, Sam, the guys...
Ah, Jamie, have you spoken to JP

23:44.260 --> 23:46.251
about our new game engine yet?

23:46.252 --> 23:48.239
Well, no,
I haven't been to San Diego yet.

23:48.240 --> 23:49.295
Well, can you get on that, please?

23:49.296 --> 23:51.319
I don't want to have to lease
a game engine any more -

23:51.320 --> 23:53.295
I want us to have our own one.

23:53.296 --> 23:56.284
And not just for GTA -
for all our games. OK.

24:01.296 --> 24:04.243
When you start dressing
in Armani and cowboy boots

24:04.244 --> 24:06.259
and start taking hard drugs
like Don there,

24:06.260 --> 24:08.288
you'll know what's been going on.

24:22.244 --> 24:26.275
So we've created a new game engine
to replace RenderWare.

24:26.276 --> 24:30.243
We're calling it
the Rockstar Advanced Game Engine -

24:30.244 --> 24:31.331
RAGE.

24:31.332 --> 24:34.271
OK, so... how are we going
to show Sam what it can do?

24:34.272 --> 24:36.243
He wants to see something soon.

24:36.244 --> 24:40.259
We were thinking we could take
some GTA scenes and show how

24:40.260 --> 24:41.319
the movement would be improved.

24:41.320 --> 24:44.283
No, he's going to want
to see something new.

24:44.284 --> 24:47.283
Trying to build a new game
engine is about producing

24:47.284 --> 24:49.255
an authenticity to movement, right?

24:49.256 --> 24:51.276
Yeah.

24:55.328 --> 24:59.283
Do ping pong.
Sam loves table tennis.

24:59.284 --> 25:02.251
If you can show him how
the ball will move in flight

25:02.252 --> 25:06.331
and get that right... Not shooting
someone or driving a car?

25:06.332 --> 25:09.291
Ping pong.

25:09.292 --> 25:13.243
OK. Is my taxi here?
I've got to get to the airport.

25:13.244 --> 25:14.307
Er... yeah, it's here.

25:14.308 --> 25:17.283
It would really help if we could
have some more people, Jamie.

25:17.284 --> 25:19.287
20 guys from here got put on GTA.

25:19.288 --> 25:21.283
Yeah, I know.
It's the same everywhere.

25:21.284 --> 25:24.291
Everyone's on GTA now till it's
released - it's the way it is.

25:24.292 --> 25:28.256
Don't ask me where the next
game is going to come from.

25:39.244 --> 25:41.292
Paging Dr Sexton...

25:45.304 --> 25:49.275
What surprised us, when we first
showed violent material to children,

25:49.276 --> 25:51.331
was how much brain
activity it produces

25:51.332 --> 25:56.239
here, an area called
the posterior cingulate.

25:56.240 --> 25:57.319
MRI research with veterans

25:57.320 --> 25:59.303
and victims of violent crime
has shown that

25:59.304 --> 26:02.255
this is an area of the brain
where we store distressing or

26:02.256 --> 26:04.307
traumatic events for
long-term memory.

26:04.308 --> 26:07.299
You're saying that the same area
of the brain that processes

26:07.300 --> 26:10.279
traumatic stress in real life

26:10.280 --> 26:13.271
is also triggered by
violent entertainment?

26:13.272 --> 26:15.251
Especially in teenagers,

26:15.252 --> 26:18.271
because their brains
aren't fully formed yet.

26:18.272 --> 26:20.275
People don't know this, Doctor -
they should -

26:20.276 --> 26:23.283
and you can prove it.

26:23.284 --> 26:25.327
Would you be willing to testify
to this in court?

26:25.328 --> 26:28.291
Of course, if necessary.
The neurology is clear.

26:28.292 --> 26:31.259
Has anyone ever asked you
to do that? No...

26:31.260 --> 26:32.320
Not yet.

26:38.248 --> 26:42.243
Your weapons training is
absolutely vital, because,

26:42.244 --> 26:45.283
as an old gunny sergeant
taught me, in combat,

26:45.284 --> 26:47.291
you don't rise to the occasion -

26:47.292 --> 26:50.323
you sink to the level
of your training.

26:50.324 --> 26:52.263
The point is this -

26:52.264 --> 26:55.259
what we teach you in training
will come out in combat...

26:55.260 --> 26:57.295
without thought.

26:57.296 --> 27:01.235
And that is why your training
needs to be the most accurate,

27:01.236 --> 27:04.324
most authentic it can be.

27:14.284 --> 27:16.331
When we use these violent games
to train soldiers,

27:16.332 --> 27:19.255
we call them combat simulators.

27:19.256 --> 27:22.279
When young kids use them at home,
they're murder simulators.

27:22.280 --> 27:24.255
You call these games
murder simulators?

27:24.256 --> 27:26.255
The same thing is going on
in both situations.

27:26.256 --> 27:27.319
You're training young
people to kill.

27:27.320 --> 27:31.296
They're making killing a conditioned
reflex stimulus response.

27:34.236 --> 27:36.247
Dave, would you be willing
to say these things

27:36.248 --> 27:38.291
in an expert witness statement
or in court? Sure.

27:38.292 --> 27:41.300
Everything that's in my book,
I am willing to say in court.

27:42.312 --> 27:44.259
Great.

27:44.260 --> 27:46.323
This coming from a man of your
first-hand military experience

27:46.324 --> 27:48.311
will really have an impact on a jury.

27:48.312 --> 27:50.287
Well, I'm happy to help,

27:50.288 --> 27:53.284
because I think that this
is a serious social issue.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.312
Say, can I trouble
you for an autograph?

28:01.236 --> 28:02.276
My pleasure.

28:07.260 --> 28:10.271
This sex scene in San Andreas
has got to be good.

28:10.272 --> 28:12.267
It's not some Benny Hill bit.

28:12.268 --> 28:14.327
It's got to be something proper
that can get people excited.

28:14.328 --> 28:17.327
Have you seen what they've
animated yet? No. Have you?

28:17.328 --> 28:22.255
No. They were looking at this scene
where Carl goes round to see Denise,

28:22.256 --> 28:24.323
she invites him in for coffee,
he goes in,

28:24.324 --> 28:27.248
has full-blown sex...

28:28.296 --> 28:31.235
...and a blowjob.
Sounds great. When can we see it?

28:31.236 --> 28:33.263
It's going to be hard
to get this stuff in, Sam.

28:33.264 --> 28:36.251
I know. No-one's ever done a sex
scene in a game before. I know,

28:36.252 --> 28:38.319
I know, but it's really important
for the vibe of the game

28:38.320 --> 28:42.235
and it has to be as good as
the best sex scenes in movies.

28:42.236 --> 28:44.299
As good as... Last Tango?

28:44.300 --> 28:46.315
Angel Heart? Nine 1/2 Weeks?

28:46.316 --> 28:50.275
As good as the Top Gun sex scene.

28:50.276 --> 28:52.295
Fucking Tom Cruise
and Kelly Mc-wotsit?

28:52.296 --> 28:54.247
You're joking!

28:54.248 --> 28:56.323
Anyway, everyone's favourite
sex scene from Top Gun is the one

28:56.324 --> 28:59.239
where all the men play
topless volleyball.

28:59.240 --> 29:02.260
Whatever. Just make it fucking good.

29:31.328 --> 29:33.271
Jack.

29:33.272 --> 29:34.307
Jack.

29:34.308 --> 29:35.315
Oh, hello, Sally.

29:35.316 --> 29:37.243
How are you?

29:37.244 --> 29:39.247
I hear you're campaigning
against the people

29:39.248 --> 29:40.319
who make those violent video games.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.315
That's right, I am. Good for you.

29:42.316 --> 29:45.331
Go get 'em, Jack.
They're fucking with our kids.

29:45.332 --> 29:47.319
Fuck these people.

29:47.320 --> 29:49.283
Fuck 'em.

29:49.284 --> 29:51.311
Well, I certainly intend to.

29:51.312 --> 29:54.311
Thank you. Can I make a donation?

29:54.312 --> 29:58.243
Oh, no need.
Just send us your prayers.

29:58.244 --> 30:00.243
I'll be on 60 Minutes tonight.

30:00.244 --> 30:01.311
I'll watch you!

30:01.312 --> 30:03.275
I'll pray for you...

30:03.276 --> 30:06.272
and I'll send them some hate mail.

30:07.304 --> 30:09.271
God bless you.

30:09.272 --> 30:12.251
'Shooting, stealing,

30:12.252 --> 30:14.311
'Grand Theft Auto has
always been controversial

30:14.312 --> 30:17.243
'and it's now the subject
of a civil lawsuit.

30:17.244 --> 30:19.239
'Florida attorney Jack Thompson

30:19.240 --> 30:22.239
'is bringing the case
against the makers of GTA.

30:22.240 --> 30:24.256
'You think that playing
Grand Theft Auto...'

30:25.320 --> 30:28.299
'Well, there's plenty of blame...'
'Turn your TV on -

30:28.300 --> 30:30.271
'that guy from Florida's
on the news.'

30:30.272 --> 30:33.275
Yeah, we're watching it.
'..responsible for what he did.'

30:33.276 --> 30:35.319
This Jack Thompson
seems to be everywhere.

30:35.320 --> 30:38.239
'He's been sending loads
of aggressive e-mails'

30:38.240 --> 30:39.267
to Take-Two management, OK?

30:39.268 --> 30:41.307
If he sends any to us,
we've been instructed not to reply.

30:41.308 --> 30:43.299
'Forward them straight
to me or Kolbe.

30:43.300 --> 30:45.251
'She'll send them to the lawyers.'

30:45.252 --> 30:47.259
'I believe that if it
wasn't for that video game,

30:47.260 --> 30:49.275
'Devin Moore wouldn't
have killed those cops.

30:49.276 --> 30:52.299
'Rockstar Games gave him
a cranial menu that popped up

30:52.300 --> 30:55.275
'and offered him the option
to kill the police officers,

30:55.276 --> 30:56.287
'shoot them in the head

30:56.288 --> 30:57.299
'and flee in a police car.

30:57.300 --> 31:00.251
'What we're saying is that
Devin Moore, in effect,

31:00.252 --> 31:01.319
'was trained to do what he did.

31:01.320 --> 31:05.311
'He bought a murder simulator and
he played it for hundreds of hours.

31:05.312 --> 31:07.275
'He's primarily a cop-killing...'

31:07.276 --> 31:09.319
That's just fucking whack.
I'll call you later, Terry.

31:09.320 --> 31:11.303
A game does not make
someone a criminal.

31:11.304 --> 31:14.255
If he hadn't played Vice,
he'd have played something else.

31:14.256 --> 31:16.295
If it's the cop-killing in the game
that's the problem,

31:16.296 --> 31:18.315
maybe we should tone it
down for San Andreas.

31:18.316 --> 31:21.259
A bit. No way, Jamie,
this is a free country.

31:21.260 --> 31:23.263
We're allowed to make
the game we want to make.

31:23.264 --> 31:25.323
We can't go around curtailing
people's artistic freedoms

31:25.324 --> 31:27.315
because of one lunatic.

31:27.316 --> 31:30.255
'If you tell the tales,
you define the culture.

31:30.256 --> 31:33.327
'Rockstar Games are telling tales
full of violence and depravity.'

31:33.328 --> 31:36.259
Parents have no idea
what their kids are playing.

31:36.260 --> 31:39.323
That's the problem. Yeah, but that's
not our fault, is it? It's theirs!

31:39.324 --> 31:41.251
They don't understand games

31:41.252 --> 31:43.259
and they want to blame
someone for these deaths,

31:43.260 --> 31:45.319
but rather than blame this kid's
parents or failed education

31:45.320 --> 31:49.247
or zero job prospects,
this man wants to blame us.

31:49.248 --> 31:51.287
I'm not changing a single
thing about GTA.

31:51.288 --> 31:53.299
OK, I agree,
I just don't think any of us like

31:53.300 --> 31:55.295
being accused of making
a murder simulator.

31:55.296 --> 31:58.255
Well, that's good, because we don't,
we make entertainment.

31:58.256 --> 32:01.287
'How do you want to make a game
that suggests, even for a moment,

32:01.288 --> 32:04.327
'that it's OK to kill police
officers?

32:04.328 --> 32:06.324
'Why do you want to do that?'

32:09.248 --> 32:12.291
'As he fled,
Moore stole a bunch of car keys.

32:12.292 --> 32:14.303
'He climbed into
a police car out front

32:14.304 --> 32:16.243
'and hit the road.

32:16.244 --> 32:17.303
'It was over within seconds.

32:17.304 --> 32:20.271
'Inside, three people
had been murdered.'

32:20.272 --> 32:23.327
I'll be in Baton Rouge - I've got
to debate Louisiana Law School.

32:23.328 --> 32:26.295
Up against a bunch of nightmare
Southern liberals.

32:26.296 --> 32:28.331
And Friday, I'm set up to be
on The Today Show again.

32:28.332 --> 32:30.303
I got a client dinner that night.

32:30.304 --> 32:33.263
Mm-hm.

32:33.264 --> 32:34.303
Hello?

32:34.304 --> 32:36.288
'I'm going to kill you fuckers.'

32:39.260 --> 32:40.320
What is it?

32:44.292 --> 32:46.260
Oh, it's gay boy!

33:21.324 --> 33:25.299
It's just kids being stupid.
Oh, I know.

33:25.300 --> 33:27.271
People who really wanna kill you,

33:27.272 --> 33:29.295
they don't phone you up
and warn you, they just do it.

33:29.296 --> 33:32.235
Yes, I know.

33:32.236 --> 33:34.247
We can't let things
like this stop us.

33:34.248 --> 33:36.311
What sort of message would that send?

33:36.312 --> 33:39.235
I agree, Jack.

33:39.236 --> 33:42.311
How about, as you burn the grass,
you get high,

33:42.312 --> 33:45.319
so it becomes harder to do.
Controls get harder.

33:45.320 --> 33:48.239
That's really funny.

33:48.240 --> 33:50.235
Jamie! How was Vienna?

33:50.236 --> 33:52.251
Good. Tiring.

33:52.252 --> 33:53.311
I need you to go
to Edinburgh tomorrow

33:53.312 --> 33:55.327
to talk to the animators
of the Truth mission, OK?

33:55.328 --> 33:58.307
They need to be better. I was
supposed to have this weekend off.

33:58.308 --> 34:00.263
I've got that stag party, remember?

34:00.264 --> 34:01.319
You're just going
to have to skip it.

34:01.320 --> 34:04.259
Yeah, it's crunch time,
I need people to dig deep.

34:04.260 --> 34:06.323
That's how I dig. We're six months
off delivering this game now

34:06.324 --> 34:09.243
and whole chunks of it
are still shit and boring.

34:09.244 --> 34:11.283
There's animation glitches
in the street scenes still,

34:11.284 --> 34:14.271
the mo-cap's terrible. Terry,
we need to hire more QA people.

34:14.272 --> 34:16.279
Take-Two won't let you
hire anyone else.

34:16.280 --> 34:18.299
At this rate, the game's going
to be six months later

34:18.300 --> 34:21.263
than we said it would be when we
said it would be six months late.

34:21.264 --> 34:23.319
I'm not going to release a shit
product into the world, guys.

34:23.320 --> 34:26.259
I'm sorry about that.
If we can't hire more people, fine -

34:26.260 --> 34:28.299
we'll just have to take people off
Manhunt and Warriors.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.306
Jamie, go to Edinburgh,
then go to Toronto

34:30.308 --> 34:32.291
and get people working on GTA.

34:32.292 --> 34:35.286
Also, I've just heard there are 63
tracks you still haven't licensed?

34:35.288 --> 34:37.275
I'm on it. They take time.

34:37.275 --> 34:39.283
You gave us 160 to do.

34:39.284 --> 34:40.286
Oh, and by the way,

34:40.288 --> 34:43.299
James Brown's publishers said they
definitely won't let us use Payback.

34:43.300 --> 34:46.243
Go back to them, persuade them,
you're really good at that

34:46.244 --> 34:48.324
and that's a really important
track for the game.

34:49.324 --> 34:52.264
Come on, mate! You're Mr Wolf!

35:18.236 --> 35:21.235
Hi, honey, good game?

35:21.236 --> 35:22.300
Uh-huh.

35:23.300 --> 35:26.244
Hey! You OK?

35:27.316 --> 35:30.235
Slow down!

35:30.236 --> 35:31.279
What's the matter?

35:31.280 --> 35:33.323
Someone took my lacrosse stick,
I think.

35:33.324 --> 35:35.307
What do you mean, "took"?

35:35.308 --> 35:37.279
On purpose?

35:37.280 --> 35:40.247
I don't know. Maybe I lost it.

35:40.248 --> 35:42.311
It doesn't matter. Hey!

35:42.312 --> 35:44.331
What's going on?

35:44.332 --> 35:47.267
Everything OK at school?

35:47.268 --> 35:51.303
Yeah. You'd tell me if there was
something wrong, wouldn't you?

35:51.304 --> 35:56.299
Look, I know you think these games
hurt people, Dad, but, you know,

35:56.300 --> 35:59.324
not every kid's about to pull
a Columbine, Dad, you know?

36:08.288 --> 36:10.315
What's wrong?

36:10.316 --> 36:12.292
He's having a tough time.

36:15.288 --> 36:17.327
This is all my fault.

36:17.328 --> 36:19.283
No, it's not.

36:19.284 --> 36:21.332
He'll be fine.
I won't let him be bullied.

36:24.288 --> 36:26.284
I'll go to the school.

36:27.332 --> 36:30.247
I'll talk to the kids.

36:30.248 --> 36:32.239
Do a convocation.

36:32.240 --> 36:34.319
Is that a good idea?
We don't want to make it worse.

36:34.320 --> 36:37.243
I won't.

36:37.244 --> 36:38.328
I'll make them understand.

36:46.316 --> 36:49.247
...those sunglasses
look like goggles.

36:49.248 --> 36:53.240
But this one's perfect,
that's good. OK. Hey!

36:55.252 --> 36:57.311
What?

36:57.312 --> 37:00.283
We've been looking at how we can
incorporate the sexual content

37:00.284 --> 37:03.303
you want in San Andreas
without hurting sales.

37:03.304 --> 37:05.288
We'll do this later. OK.

37:07.288 --> 37:10.243
It's a question of how far we
can push the creative envelope

37:10.244 --> 37:12.287
in this area and still
get a mature rating.

37:12.288 --> 37:17.239
If we get an adults-only rating,
about 80% of shops and distributors

37:17.240 --> 37:20.271
in the US, particularly Wal-Mart,
won't stock the game.

37:20.272 --> 37:23.255
I've always been clear about this -
this stuff is not gratuitous.

37:23.256 --> 37:25.307
It's done within context
and it's been linked to the story.

37:25.308 --> 37:28.327
What's acceptable as sexual content
is different in different countries.

37:28.328 --> 37:31.259
I can send you a full list
of the various dos and don'ts.

37:31.260 --> 37:32.287
It'll depress you.

37:32.288 --> 37:35.283
Broadly, male nudity is acceptable
as long as the penis isn't erect.

37:35.284 --> 37:37.287
No erect cocks? That's right.

37:37.288 --> 37:39.323
The US is the most sensitive
country by miles.

37:39.324 --> 37:42.271
No penises, no vaginas, no nipples.

37:42.272 --> 37:45.263
So that scene you've got animated
of Carl having sex with Denise,

37:45.264 --> 37:47.303
that will get us an instant
adults-only label here

37:47.304 --> 37:49.291
and needs removing.
That's ridiculous.

37:49.292 --> 37:51.243
We don't all live in a virtual Utah.

37:51.244 --> 37:53.319
I know, I wish we could include
that stuff, but it's not feasible.

37:53.320 --> 37:56.235
What's wrong with this country?

37:56.236 --> 37:58.287
I can walk down the road
and get an Uzi if I want to,

37:58.288 --> 38:00.287
they're sending kids off
to kill people in Iraq

38:00.288 --> 38:03.259
and heaven for-fucking-bid
anyone sees a woman's nipple!

38:03.260 --> 38:06.255
That's America. The Jack Thompsons
of this world won't have it.

38:06.256 --> 38:07.315
I don't care what he thinks.

38:07.316 --> 38:09.255
I'm not going to bend to this.

38:09.256 --> 38:10.311
Sex is a perfectly acceptable thing

38:10.312 --> 38:12.287
to have in a piece
of adult entertainment

38:12.288 --> 38:15.235
and we are not pushing
boundaries without it.

38:15.236 --> 38:17.303
Maybe we should just be an AO game.

38:17.304 --> 38:20.259
We're a game for adults -
fine, let's just be that.

38:20.260 --> 38:22.275
That would be retail suicide.
Who cares!

38:22.276 --> 38:25.279
So we sell half of what we hoped -
at least we get to make our game.

38:25.280 --> 38:27.295
I'm not having the content
of my game dictated to me

38:27.296 --> 38:29.296
by a bunch of moronic shopkeepers!

38:31.308 --> 38:34.268
Don Simpson wouldn't
settle for it, would he?

38:35.316 --> 38:37.275
What would he do?

38:37.276 --> 38:39.319
He'd hire an aircraft carrier,
fill it with prostitutes,

38:39.320 --> 38:43.291
take 15 different types of class-A
drugs and then, I think,

38:43.292 --> 38:45.332
he'd accept the power
of the marketplace.

38:52.288 --> 38:54.280
Fine, take the scene out.

38:56.292 --> 38:58.331
There's no time, the game's due.

38:58.332 --> 39:00.284
Happy?

39:09.324 --> 39:11.263
Blank Rome has been confirmed

39:11.264 --> 39:13.287
as the defence counsel
for Rockstar and Take-Two.

39:13.288 --> 39:15.303
That is a big, serious law firm.

39:15.304 --> 39:18.275
They're going to fight you
every step of the way. Good!

39:18.276 --> 39:20.299
You know what? I want this fight.

39:20.300 --> 39:23.307
Believe me, Jack, they will look
into every corner of your life,

39:23.308 --> 39:26.295
of our lives,
to try and discredit you.

39:26.296 --> 39:28.331
Let 'em - I've got nothing to hide.

39:28.332 --> 39:31.327
You ever smoke dope at college?
Fake a tax receipt?

39:31.328 --> 39:33.271
Failed to pay a fine?

39:33.272 --> 39:37.243
They'll try and find out, they'll
try and pathologize your behaviour.

39:37.244 --> 39:39.271
Make you seem like a fanatic.

39:39.272 --> 39:41.295
Forget what I've done.

39:41.296 --> 39:44.275
I'm going to do my best to make
their lives a living hell.

39:44.276 --> 39:48.275
No, don't try and attack them.
They are not the target, are they?

39:48.276 --> 39:50.332
The target is the video games
industry.

39:52.236 --> 39:56.243
Keep your eye on the target,
Jack. Right.

39:56.244 --> 40:00.236
Here's Villagio's.
Let's pray for a parking space.

40:01.308 --> 40:04.247
You know this Jack Thompson guy?
What about him?

40:04.248 --> 40:07.239
You know he got Howard Stern
thrown off the air? Yeah?

40:07.240 --> 40:10.284
He got a 2 Live Crew album banned
and now he's having a go at us.

40:10.285 --> 40:13.287
The whole Devin Moore case,
they're just using us as scapegoats.

40:13.288 --> 40:17.259
These people have an issue
with the entire gaming industry.

40:17.260 --> 40:21.239
They'll find any excuse.
Yeah, but this guy wins.

40:21.240 --> 40:23.263
He's relentless and
he's clearly obsessive.

40:23.264 --> 40:25.235
He won against a rap band,
that's all.

40:25.236 --> 40:26.327
You're not taking this
seriously enough.

40:26.328 --> 40:30.303
Listen, we've got Blank Rome, yeah?
A seriously heavyweight law firm.

40:30.304 --> 40:32.247
He won't know what's hit him.

40:32.248 --> 40:34.279
They say Thompson's
his own worst enemy.

40:34.280 --> 40:37.252
He's a bigmouth, can't help himself.

40:39.264 --> 40:43.259
"Your client and what it does

40:43.260 --> 40:45.327
"is indefensible.

40:45.328 --> 40:48.327
"You disgrace us as lawyers.

40:48.328 --> 40:51.299
"Shame on you."

40:51.300 --> 40:53.299
You OK?

40:53.300 --> 40:54.331
Doing battle, honey.

40:54.332 --> 40:56.256
Doing battle.

40:58.316 --> 41:00.280
Good night.

41:06.312 --> 41:10.267
"These men have done
their level best

41:10.268 --> 41:15.299
"to promote what John Paul II
called a 'culture of death'

41:15.300 --> 41:18.328
"to an entire generation
of American children."

41:20.264 --> 41:23.323
Make this filth disappear...

41:23.324 --> 41:25.255
Torturing our children,

41:25.256 --> 41:27.295
violence...

41:27.296 --> 41:29.328
depravity...

41:36.300 --> 41:41.295
"Absolutely the dumbest thing
you ever did was hire Blank Rome

41:41.296 --> 41:43.320
"as your law firm."

41:53.320 --> 41:57.247
John, Dave. Thanks so much
for coming, all of you. Hey, Jack.

41:57.248 --> 41:59.263
When the judge hears
your expert testimonies,

41:59.264 --> 42:01.267
there'll be no way
he can dispute the influence

42:01.268 --> 42:03.276
of Grand Theft Auto on Devin's case.

42:10.296 --> 42:12.279
Who are they? Blank Rome.

42:12.280 --> 42:14.248
Rockstar's lawyers.

42:27.268 --> 42:30.291
Jack, a word.

42:30.292 --> 42:32.267
800.

42:32.268 --> 42:35.307
800 pages from Blank Rome
describing all your campaigning,

42:35.308 --> 42:37.247
despite the case being active,

42:37.248 --> 42:39.319
including press releases that you
have written about this case

42:39.320 --> 42:43.235
before it's even been heard.
Ray, they want me off the case.

42:43.236 --> 42:45.259
They're scared of me.

42:45.260 --> 42:49.263
You've been on The Today Show
seven times talking about this!

42:49.264 --> 42:53.307
Eight times. And Fox News.
You know it's not allowed.

42:53.308 --> 42:56.323
You're killing our case, Jack,
before it's even started.

42:56.324 --> 43:00.239
Did you write to the CEO
of Take-Two telling him

43:00.240 --> 43:03.283
that you're going to take him
for every penny that he has?

43:03.284 --> 43:06.247
Yes, I did, and I don't regret it.

43:06.248 --> 43:10.235
Did you say in the press that
Sony dumping GTA on American kids

43:10.236 --> 43:13.236
was "effectively Pearl Harbor 2"?

43:23.240 --> 43:26.279
All of these communications
are fundamental violations

43:26.280 --> 43:28.267
of Bar ethical codes.

43:28.268 --> 43:30.315
If you think I'm going to allow
this sort of grandstanding

43:30.316 --> 43:32.331
in my courtroom,
you are absolutely wrong.

43:32.332 --> 43:35.291
OK, I understand your position,
Your Honour.

43:35.292 --> 43:37.267
That's become very clear.

43:37.268 --> 43:41.299
Myself and Mr Reiser have discussed
that and I'm happy to step down.

43:41.300 --> 43:46.299
My colleague can prosecute it
very ably without my assistance.

43:46.300 --> 43:50.263
It's not up to you whether you take
part or not, it's up to me.

43:50.264 --> 43:53.279
And given your manner and your
numerous violations of Bar ethics,

43:53.280 --> 43:55.328
you're right,
you will not be taking part.

44:30.240 --> 44:31.244
Mom... Is Dad OK?

44:34.240 --> 44:37.296
I mean, he told one of the moms at
school today he was Eliot Ness.

44:41.256 --> 44:43.332
He's got his big civil case,
you know how he gets.

44:45.296 --> 44:49.295
He's doing what
the Lord wants him to.

44:49.296 --> 44:54.239
He said he's going to come to the school
and talk about violence in video games.

44:54.240 --> 44:55.311
Is that what's bothering you?

44:55.312 --> 44:59.255
Don't worry, honey, your dad is
a brilliant public speaker.

44:59.256 --> 45:01.319
He won't embarrass you.

45:01.320 --> 45:04.287
You should be pleased you've got
a dad who's prepared to do

45:04.288 --> 45:06.272
these things, huh?

45:18.320 --> 45:20.300
All rise.

45:29.256 --> 45:30.324
Be seated.

45:34.316 --> 45:36.295
The question before this court is

45:36.296 --> 45:38.323
whether Devin Moore's crimes

45:38.324 --> 45:42.263
are the result of his use of
Grand Theft Auto

45:42.264 --> 45:46.239
and, despite their expertise
and interesting points they raise,

45:46.240 --> 45:48.247
since the plaintiff's experts have

45:48.248 --> 45:50.263
acknowledged that they have
never met Devin Moore

45:50.264 --> 45:53.279
and have no personal knowledge of
his specific crimes,

45:53.280 --> 45:56.256
I cannot consider their evidence.

45:58.248 --> 46:00.235
Since they have never met Devin,

46:00.236 --> 46:03.235
they cannot know if he engaged
in scripted behaviour.

46:03.236 --> 46:06.271
In fact, I am entirely unpersuaded
he carried out his violent

46:06.272 --> 46:09.327
actions because he had been
programmed by a video game.

46:09.328 --> 46:13.331
Therefore, summary judgment is
granted in favour of the defendants.

46:13.332 --> 46:15.328
Case dismissed.

46:16.332 --> 46:18.248
That's outrageous.

46:33.288 --> 46:35.268
Jack...

46:36.272 --> 46:38.279
Jack.

46:38.280 --> 46:40.255
Jack!

46:40.256 --> 46:43.283
Nice job, guys. You must be very
pleased with yourselves.

46:43.284 --> 46:47.311
Mr Thompson, you should be aware
that we're going to ask

46:47.312 --> 46:50.315
the Florida Bar to look at
your behaviour in this case

46:50.316 --> 46:53.275
for your repeated
professional misconduct.

46:53.276 --> 46:58.243
Guys, I'm not the one breaking
the law. Your clients are.

46:58.244 --> 47:01.307
Every time they sell one of those
violent, evil games to a child.

47:01.308 --> 47:03.300
Excuse me.

47:12.288 --> 47:16.315
Dan? They chucked it out. They
chucked what out? What do you think?

47:16.316 --> 47:19.275
The Thompson civil case - the judge
threw it out.

47:19.276 --> 47:20.319
Blank-Rome did us proud.

47:20.320 --> 47:23.260
So, it's over? It's over.

47:25.264 --> 47:28.303
It was ridiculous to blame those
murders on the games anyway.

47:28.304 --> 47:30.319
Forget it.
Listen, San Andreas is due.

47:30.320 --> 47:33.264
Clear your head - finish the game.

48:29.328 --> 48:33.236
Terry! What are you talking
about...? Thanks, man.

49:15.328 --> 49:19.323
So, how's life in Westchester, Pat?
Great. You must come up some time.

49:19.324 --> 49:21.324
Yeah, I must. I'd like that.

49:22.328 --> 49:26.255
So, here you are, Pat,

49:26.256 --> 49:31.239
the first official copy of
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.

49:31.240 --> 49:35.288
Two years of work, our biggest
and best game ever, I think.

49:39.292 --> 49:41.311
I'm sure it'll be
a massive hit for you.

49:41.312 --> 49:44.299
Anything we need to know about from
a ratings board perspective?

49:44.300 --> 49:47.272
No, it should be another mature
rating. Good.

49:48.276 --> 49:52.287
Yazooks! Man, have you played
GTA: San Andreas yet?

49:52.288 --> 49:55.323
It is unbelievable how much cool
stuff there is to do in this game.

49:55.324 --> 49:59.259
Driving, gambling, dancing,
killing people - you can turn

49:59.260 --> 50:02.283
Carl into whatever kind of bad ass
hero you want him to be.

50:02.284 --> 50:06.271
Change his clothes, change his
weapons, get him fit, get him fat,

50:06.272 --> 50:08.243
make him whatever you want.

50:08.244 --> 50:10.312
Trust me, you're going
to love it. Pow!

50:13.312 --> 50:18.304
Mm-hmm. OK, thanks, I appreciate you
telling me right away.

50:22.300 --> 50:24.275
Blank-Rome has submitted a motion

50:24.276 --> 50:27.247
to the Florida Bar Association to
have me disbarred.

50:27.248 --> 50:30.247
They're claiming I tried to hide
my previous disciplinary record,

50:30.248 --> 50:32.272
which is a lie.
I disclosed everything...

50:34.280 --> 50:37.244
Little bastards!

50:39.328 --> 50:41.323
Come back here!

50:41.324 --> 50:43.323
Come back here!

50:43.324 --> 50:45.308
Asshole!

50:47.300 --> 50:49.307
Keep running! Come back here!

50:49.308 --> 50:51.299
Come back! Fuck off, loser!

50:51.300 --> 50:53.240
You fat fuck!

50:57.324 --> 51:01.311
Do you want to make a report?
Not unless it happens again.

51:01.312 --> 51:03.328
I'm sorry. Careful.

51:06.240 --> 51:09.276
You still think I did the right
thing, taking on these guys?

51:10.328 --> 51:13.280
Of course I do.

51:14.284 --> 51:16.315
But you don't want this.

51:16.316 --> 51:18.264
No.

51:21.280 --> 51:26.235
It just feels so degrading to have
to engage with these people.

51:26.236 --> 51:28.324
It makes me angry
and that affects you.

51:29.328 --> 51:32.235
Don't worry about us.

51:32.236 --> 51:37.243
You're doing righteous work,
Jack Thompson.

51:37.244 --> 51:40.316
If you judge a man by his enemies,
you're a great man.

52:09.248 --> 52:11.267
What do you want from me, Lord?

52:11.268 --> 52:14.239
Is this what you want,
me fighting these people?

52:14.240 --> 52:16.235
Because it feels like death.

52:16.236 --> 52:19.243
It's so destructive to my soul
and my family.

52:19.244 --> 52:21.332
I'm not sure how much longer I can
endure it.

52:24.292 --> 52:28.284
If this is your will, Father, show me
a sign.

52:31.284 --> 52:32.328
Stop me from hating them.

52:35.288 --> 52:38.240
Give me the strength to not hate
them.

52:39.324 --> 52:41.331
Hey, fella!

52:41.332 --> 52:43.332
Move along, please!

53:04.260 --> 53:05.319
Terry!

53:05.320 --> 53:09.243
Have you seen the number of comments
we're getting back,

53:09.244 --> 53:10.267
the RPG and San Andreas?

53:10.268 --> 53:12.319
People love how they can adapt Carl.
Forget that.

53:12.320 --> 53:15.244
Have you seen how many units we've
sold?

53:16.248 --> 53:18.320
That's amazing. It is amazing.

53:20.316 --> 53:22.323
Stop what you're doing, everybody!

53:22.324 --> 53:24.240
Ping-pong competition.

53:25.300 --> 53:28.284
Figures must be amazing cos it
does not get better than that!

53:44.312 --> 53:46.292
Hoi. Hoi!

55:08.236 --> 55:09.292
JP...

55:12.260 --> 55:14.239
I fucking love it!

55:14.240 --> 55:17.263
It's the best animated movement I've
ever seen.

55:17.264 --> 55:18.344
Well done, fella, it's ace.

55:21.260 --> 55:22.311
It should be our next game.

55:22.312 --> 55:23.328
Table tennis? Yeah.

55:24.328 --> 55:28.263
Re-doing Pong? We'll do World
Championship Table Tennis.

55:28.264 --> 55:30.307
We'll do the best, most exciting,
most authentic,

55:30.308 --> 55:33.256
table tennis game that's ever been
made. Right!

55:38.276 --> 55:40.296
What?

55:43.268 --> 55:46.284
'You're incredible, you should get
paid for this.'

55:49.236 --> 55:50.295
Come on, girl!

55:50.296 --> 55:52.276
How did they get a hold of this?

55:57.252 --> 55:59.239
Don't answer that. I'm serious.

55:59.240 --> 56:00.360
This is going to get brutal.

56:03.284 --> 56:06.275
It's had thousands of hits and it's
been on for two hours.

56:06.276 --> 56:08.283
How the fuck did this get out
there?!

56:08.284 --> 56:10.276
Who put this out there?

56:12.264 --> 56:14.295
NO! Nobody answer your phones, OK?

56:14.296 --> 56:16.332
Jesus!

56:18.320 --> 56:21.271
'You're incredible, you
should get paid for this.'

56:21.272 --> 56:23.260
They created this for an M-rated
game?

56:24.284 --> 56:26.264
This is it, Ray.

56:27.264 --> 56:30.311
This is proof that Sam Houser has
absolutely no regard for the law,

56:30.312 --> 56:32.284
or children's welfare.

56:34.300 --> 56:36.292
I prayed for something like this.

56:40.256 --> 56:43.279
Is this part of the game?
You don't think so.

56:43.280 --> 56:45.243
If this scene was in the game,

56:45.244 --> 56:47.295
Rockstar would have
highlighted it with us.

56:47.296 --> 56:48.323
Are you sure about that? Yes.

56:48.324 --> 56:51.235
So where'd it come from?
We're trying to find out.

56:51.236 --> 56:53.303
Yeah, well we need to know because
this kind of thing confirms

56:53.304 --> 56:56.299
everyone's worst fears about the
gaming industry.

56:56.300 --> 56:58.283
This could undo years of lobbying.

56:58.284 --> 57:01.300
If Rockstar misled you, I want to
know.

57:20.252 --> 57:21.284
Patrick!

57:36.272 --> 57:40.283
Pat, I assure you that sex scene is
not in the game.

57:40.284 --> 57:43.319
It's a third party modification, made
by some hacker in their bedroom

57:43.320 --> 57:45.323
and then put on YouTube.

57:45.324 --> 57:48.247
Well, it's had over 20,000 hits now.

57:48.248 --> 57:49.307
The integrity of our rating system

57:49.308 --> 57:53.327
depends on customers trusting our judgment,
so we're going to investigate fully, OK?

57:53.328 --> 57:56.247
And if there's been a violation,

57:56.248 --> 58:00.291
we'll take appropriate action. OK,
Pat, there hasn't been a violation.

58:00.292 --> 58:02.332
I'm telling you it was the modders.

58:19.308 --> 58:22.331
We're confident that the ESRB
investigation will uphold the correct

58:22.332 --> 58:24.315
rating of GTA: San Andreas.

58:24.316 --> 58:27.303
Was the hot copy coding included on
the games disc?

58:27.304 --> 58:30.323
The scene is the work of a group of
hackers or modders who've gone to

58:30.324 --> 58:35.255
significant trouble to alter scenes
in the official version, in violation

58:35.256 --> 58:37.319
of the user software agreement.
OK, thanks.

58:37.320 --> 58:40.263
You've got to be fucking kidding me.
Who's idea was that?

58:40.264 --> 58:42.279
Shut up, Jamie. He usually knows
what he's doing.

58:42.280 --> 58:45.295
Does he?! That we're blaming our
biggest fans?

58:45.296 --> 58:48.296
Where's Sam?
Coming back from Edinburgh.

58:58.296 --> 59:00.256
Shit!

59:04.256 --> 59:07.260
Terry! What were you
fucking thinking?

59:08.260 --> 59:10.275
I'm trying to protect
the company, Sam,

59:10.276 --> 59:14.235
while you were in Edinburgh.
By blaming the modders.

59:14.236 --> 59:17.319
Sorry, but it's the most stupid PR
decision I've heard of in my life.

59:17.320 --> 59:19.247
Sam?

59:19.248 --> 59:20.312
Fuck you.

59:31.276 --> 59:34.276
They've sentenced Devin Moore
to death by lethal injection.

59:36.244 --> 59:37.312
Ah, he's a victim, too.

59:41.292 --> 59:43.272
You want me to...? I got it.

59:46.288 --> 59:47.308
Hello?

59:50.288 --> 59:53.288
Certainly. One moment, please.

59:54.324 --> 59:57.248
It's Hillary Clinton, for you.

01:00:01.312 --> 01:00:04.235
We're here from Blank Rome
to understand

01:00:04.236 --> 01:00:07.275
the situation as best we can so we
can advise your owners, Take-Two,

01:00:07.276 --> 01:00:09.251
and yourselves if necessary,

01:00:09.252 --> 01:00:12.267
on any legal action you may be
likely to face as a result

01:00:12.268 --> 01:00:15.311
of the so-called Hot Coffee scene
that's come to light.

01:00:15.312 --> 01:00:18.271
Sure. I-I'm very happy to help.

01:00:18.272 --> 01:00:21.287
Is the sex scene in the game, as
some people are saying? No, it's not.

01:00:21.288 --> 01:00:24.319
Therefore Patrick Wildenborg, this
Dutch hacker, made it? He created it?

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:27.331
No. So where did it come from?

01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:30.239
It's a scene that we
had created for the game

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:33.240
but then we didn't want to use. It's
not in the game. It was removed.

01:00:37.312 --> 01:00:40.327
The scene would have prevented
the game getting an M rating.

01:00:40.328 --> 01:00:44.283
Yeah, yeah, that's one reason, sure.
But also, I just didn't like it.

01:00:44.284 --> 01:00:47.272
It didn't fit the vibe of the game.
The rendering was shit.

01:00:48.312 --> 01:00:51.323
So, you know,
I said that we'd get rid of it.

01:00:51.324 --> 01:00:55.291
You said, "Get rid of it,"
and it's not in the game.

01:00:55.292 --> 01:00:58.315
So how did Patrick Wildenborg
come across it?

01:00:58.316 --> 01:01:02.287
Well, it's hidden in the code,
so he hacked it.

01:01:02.288 --> 01:01:03.324
So it's in the code.

01:01:06.252 --> 01:01:11.259
Forgive me, the game is made up
of code, isn't it, on the disk? Yes.

01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:13.243
So does it not therefore follow that

01:01:13.244 --> 01:01:15.311
if it's in the code
it's in the game?

01:01:15.312 --> 01:01:17.311
Well, no, it doesn't, it's a little

01:01:17.312 --> 01:01:20.243
more complicated
than that, actually.

01:01:20.244 --> 01:01:22.240
Explain.

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:25.279
The scene is in the code,
but the players can't access it.

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:28.255
But Wildenborg did. Well,
he shouldn't have done, should he?

01:01:28.256 --> 01:01:32.272
What he did was illegal? It breached
the purchaser's license agreement?

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:36.239
It's not as simple as that.

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.295
Whatever the end user
agreement may say,

01:01:38.296 --> 01:01:42.319
modders have a well-known history
of adapting Grand Theft Auto.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.303
Don't they?

01:01:44.304 --> 01:01:47.247
Er, sorry, did somebody offer you
a drink when you came in?

01:01:47.248 --> 01:01:50.303
Do you want a tea or coffee
or anything? No, thank you. Mm-hm.

01:01:50.304 --> 01:01:52.315
If you didn't want
the sex scene in the game,

01:01:52.316 --> 01:01:55.303
why did you leave it there in the
code, where hackers could find it?

01:01:55.304 --> 01:01:58.235
Why didn't you just remove it fully?
Well, Michelle,

01:01:58.236 --> 01:02:01.239
because it is complicated to remove
something like that. It's hard.

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.291
If you fiddle with the code,
it can have a knock-on

01:02:03.292 --> 01:02:06.255
effect on a lot of things
that are very hard to predict.

01:02:06.256 --> 01:02:07.303
We were in the run-up to delivery.

01:02:07.304 --> 01:02:10.259
It was too complicated for you
to remove this prohibited sex

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:13.327
scene from the game?
How many people do you employ?

01:02:13.328 --> 01:02:16.259
You employ 983 people.

01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:19.287
Last year, your company made
over 253 million.

01:02:19.288 --> 01:02:22.287
But you're saying it was
too complicated to remove

01:02:22.288 --> 01:02:25.287
a prohibited sex scene from the code
of the game, code that hackers are

01:02:25.288 --> 01:02:30.244
not only allowed to enter but do so,
sometimes with Rockstar's blessing?

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.275
So, Sam, is it not true that
far from removing the sex scene,

01:02:34.276 --> 01:02:37.311
you deliberately left it in a place
where you knew it was highly

01:02:37.312 --> 01:02:39.319
likely to be found?
No.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:41.272
No. OK? Absolutely not.

01:02:45.288 --> 01:02:47.288
Please, I thought
you guys were on my side?

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:53.283
Let me assure you,
if the Feds prosecute you for this,

01:02:53.284 --> 01:02:56.256
we're a picnic compared to
what you'll face in court.

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:08.331
Mr Thompson. Yes. Hello. Good day.

01:03:08.332 --> 01:03:10.288
This way, please. Thank you.

01:03:19.292 --> 01:03:23.235
Jack Thompson! Thank you so much
for coming to see us.

01:03:23.236 --> 01:03:25.300
Thanks for asking me.
Please. Thank you.

01:03:28.272 --> 01:03:30.323
The Senator's very interested
in what you've been

01:03:30.324 --> 01:03:33.243
saying in the media
about violent video games.

01:03:33.244 --> 01:03:35.279
As a parent and a politician,
Hillary's very

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:38.279
concerned about these games
that are being sold to our children.

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:40.271
Well, I'm delighted to hear that.

01:03:40.272 --> 01:03:44.307
We may have different politics, but
I think this is a bipartisan issue.

01:03:44.308 --> 01:03:46.279
In addition to the violence,

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:50.235
these recent revelations
about this so-called Hot Coffee

01:03:50.236 --> 01:03:53.255
sex scene perfectly demonstrate
what little regard these game

01:03:53.256 --> 01:03:55.255
designers, these Brits,

01:03:55.256 --> 01:03:59.275
have for our federal laws
or the welfare of our children.

01:03:59.276 --> 01:04:01.291
Yes, we are aware of that scene.

01:04:01.292 --> 01:04:04.299
The Senator's keen to have
the House investigate the issue.

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:08.315
But more broadly, what scientific
evidence is there linking

01:04:08.316 --> 01:04:11.235
violent video games
with violent behaviour?

01:04:11.236 --> 01:04:13.271
There's lots of precise
scientific evidence.

01:04:13.272 --> 01:04:16.255
I've been travelling round
the country talking to experts,

01:04:16.256 --> 01:04:19.264
including neurologists from the NIH,
who've done CT scans of...

01:04:20.284 --> 01:04:22.331
Hey, hey, ho, ho,
Rockstar's gotta go!

01:04:22.332 --> 01:04:26.296
Hey, hey, ho, ho,
Rockstar's gotta go!

01:04:55.328 --> 01:04:59.259
After a thorough investigation,
we have concluded

01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:03.319
that sexually explicit material
exists in a fully rendered form

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:07.291
on the final disk
of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.

01:05:07.292 --> 01:05:11.307
The existence of this
undisclosed content has seriously

01:05:11.308 --> 01:05:14.324
undermined the credibility
of the ESRB's rating.

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:20.307
Yeah? 'Where are you?
No-one knows where you are.'

01:05:20.308 --> 01:05:24.307
I'm heading upstate for a bit.
So, the ESRB have found us guilty.

01:05:24.308 --> 01:05:27.247
'They re-rated the game
as adults only.'

01:05:27.248 --> 01:05:30.251
Take-Two are pulling every disk
out of every store

01:05:30.252 --> 01:05:32.323
in America at a cost of 25 million.

01:05:32.324 --> 01:05:34.272
'We need you back here, Sam.'

01:05:55.248 --> 01:05:57.323
The Federal Trade Commission
has been ordered to investigate

01:05:57.324 --> 01:06:00.283
Rockstar over Hot Coffee.
That's good!

01:06:00.284 --> 01:06:03.259
Oh, it's better than good, honey.
It's great.

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:05.283
It'll bring a lot of unwanted
heat on Rockstar.

01:06:05.284 --> 01:06:07.327
This is all because of the briefing
I gave Hillary.

01:06:07.328 --> 01:06:10.299
Oh, your good friend Hillary, huh?
HE LAUGHS

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:13.244
Just goes to prove, if the Lord
asks you to do something...

01:06:14.284 --> 01:06:16.264
...you sure as hell better do it!

01:06:17.308 --> 01:06:20.331
Hello? WOMAN: 'Why are you
such an asshole?'

01:06:20.332 --> 01:06:22.315
Why am I an asshole?

01:06:22.316 --> 01:06:24.331
It's a hate call.

01:06:24.332 --> 01:06:26.324
Why do you think I'm an asshole?

01:06:30.256 --> 01:06:32.248
Are we going to use this?

01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:35.300
What shall we tell them?

01:06:36.312 --> 01:06:38.252
That they're not right.

01:06:39.284 --> 01:06:41.296
OK, what don't you like about it?

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:47.280
Sam, are you all right?

01:06:59.272 --> 01:07:02.323
The House of Representatives have
voted 355 to 21 to investigate

01:07:02.324 --> 01:07:06.275
Hot Coffee and whether we committed
fraud. Fraud?! What fraud?

01:07:06.276 --> 01:07:09.263
Misleading the ratings board.
Misrepresenting the game.

01:07:09.264 --> 01:07:10.291
Well, that's insane!

01:07:10.292 --> 01:07:13.307
We didn't commit fraud,
so we'll be fine. We can fight it.

01:07:13.308 --> 01:07:17.251
Why was that scene
allowed to be left on the disks?

01:07:17.252 --> 01:07:19.251
I thought you ran this company.
Shut up, Terry!

01:07:19.252 --> 01:07:21.303
If something's wrong, somebody
needs to point it out to me!

01:07:21.304 --> 01:07:23.323
Let's not turn this
into a blamestorm.

01:07:23.324 --> 01:07:25.331
Let's just work out
how we get through this.

01:07:25.332 --> 01:07:27.331
This is all due
to this Jack Thompson guy.

01:07:27.332 --> 01:07:29.243
Blank Rome will advise us

01:07:29.244 --> 01:07:31.255
on how to deal with
the Federal Trade Commission.

01:07:31.256 --> 01:07:33.267
Let's be cool-headed about this.
It's a process.

01:07:33.268 --> 01:07:35.327
We can hire experts in Washington
and be guided through it.

01:07:35.328 --> 01:07:37.315
Will the Feds call me in
to give evidence?

01:07:37.316 --> 01:07:39.268
They can call any of us in.

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:44.267
Somehow, this has become personal.

01:07:44.268 --> 01:07:47.255
Somehow, these people in Washington
have become convinced that

01:07:47.256 --> 01:07:49.271
WE are responsible
for teenage sex and violence.

01:07:49.272 --> 01:07:50.319
It is ridiculous!

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:53.299
If these scenes were in a film
or a book, no-one would even blink.

01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:56.259
This beautiful game we made's
only going to be remembered

01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:57.292
for this shit.

01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:02.251
I don't want anyone communicating
by e-mail any more, OK?

01:08:02.252 --> 01:08:03.287
Nothing in writing.

01:08:03.288 --> 01:08:05.295
If we have any important meetings,
we take them

01:08:05.296 --> 01:08:07.307
outside on the street.
And tell the whole office.

01:08:07.308 --> 01:08:10.239
They won't have bugged us.
You don't know that, mate.

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:12.280
And you don't know what
these people are capable of.

01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:26.287
Jamie? Who the fuck gave
all our e-mails to the FDC?

01:08:26.287 --> 01:08:29.323
We had to. Sam, you can't refuse
a request from the Feds.

01:08:29.323 --> 01:08:33.234
If we get this wrong, they could
take all of this. You know that.

01:08:33.236 --> 01:08:35.240
I need to talk to you. Go outside.

01:08:45.296 --> 01:08:47.236
Can I have one?

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:57.251
I don't want you going to
that conference in Vegas

01:08:57.252 --> 01:08:58.323
next weekend, all right?

01:08:58.323 --> 01:09:01.323
I don't want anyone
going to any conferences.

01:09:02.328 --> 01:09:06.247
OK. Those table-tennis
screen shots are shit.

01:09:06.247 --> 01:09:09.295
The crowd perspective's all wrong,
the colours are too muted.

01:09:09.296 --> 01:09:11.331
What has JP been doing
for the last two weeks?

01:09:11.332 --> 01:09:14.279
Well, he's been waiting
for you to feed back on them.

01:09:14.279 --> 01:09:15.319
Here's my feedback. He's fired.

01:09:15.319 --> 01:09:19.251
Sam! No, seriously,
go to San Diego and fire him.

01:09:19.252 --> 01:09:21.314
Twice he's sent screen shots
I wouldn't put up in a classroom.

01:09:21.316 --> 01:09:23.319
Does he realise
how fucking untalented he is?

01:09:23.319 --> 01:09:26.283
Does he wake up going,
"Fuck, I'm not that talented,"

01:09:26.283 --> 01:09:29.279
or is he oblivious
to his own shitness?

01:09:29.279 --> 01:09:31.323
Yeah, sure, I'll ask him that
as I fire him.

01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:37.287
It's all Terry's fault, this.

01:09:39.304 --> 01:09:41.303
Don't you think?

01:09:41.304 --> 01:09:44.323
Which bit? That press release.
It's because he's not a gamer.

01:09:44.323 --> 01:09:48.316
Not really. He doesn't
understand the fans. Sam...

01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:52.264
...it's late.

01:09:53.332 --> 01:09:56.311
Let's go home.
I'll finish this.

01:09:56.312 --> 01:09:58.252
OK.

01:11:00.248 --> 01:11:02.312
Hey. How's it going at the coalface?

01:11:09.292 --> 01:11:13.251
Hi, Jamie. Back from San Diego?
Oh, no, this is my avatar.

01:11:13.252 --> 01:11:16.252
I'm actually having
a holiday on a tropical island.

01:11:19.324 --> 01:11:22.291
I just wanted to let you know,
whatever happens,

01:11:22.292 --> 01:11:24.307
we'll always look after you, OK?

01:11:24.308 --> 01:11:27.260
You're a key part
of the Rockstar family.

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:31.272
Jen?

01:11:32.308 --> 01:11:34.323
It never occurred to me
that you wouldn't.

01:11:34.324 --> 01:11:36.252
Good.

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:41.260
Fuck.

01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:45.260
Leaving early, Terry? It's 11pm!

01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:13.239
So...

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:15.235
you're doing this talk tomorrow
at school.

01:12:15.236 --> 01:12:17.256
Yeah, I'm just writing it.

01:12:20.328 --> 01:12:22.299
Hey.

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:24.252
Don't worry, Son.

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:28.275
Do you realise the shit I've been
getting about this? What,

01:12:28.276 --> 01:12:30.247
because I'm doing this talk?

01:12:30.248 --> 01:12:33.243
They know you're going to tell them
all to stop playing video games.

01:12:33.244 --> 01:12:35.239
They've seen you on TV.

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:37.307
I'm not going to make things worse
for you, Johnny, I promise.

01:12:37.308 --> 01:12:39.256
I want to make it better.

01:12:42.292 --> 01:12:45.288
This is what I've written.
You tell me if you like it.

01:12:48.296 --> 01:12:51.300
"If you play violent video games,
you will go to hell."

01:12:53.256 --> 01:12:55.299
I'm just kidding!

01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:56.324
OK?

01:13:00.252 --> 01:13:01.304
"This...

01:13:02.312 --> 01:13:05.243
"..is the greatest computer
ever devised.

01:13:05.244 --> 01:13:08.295
"You have a choice, but I think
you should be aware of what it is

01:13:08.296 --> 01:13:11.256
"you're putting
on your cranial hard drive.

01:13:13.256 --> 01:13:16.279
"Some of you may resent me
for suggesting you stop playing

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:18.263
"violent video games.

01:13:18.264 --> 01:13:20.235
"Fair enough.

01:13:20.236 --> 01:13:23.240
"You have that right.
But give me this.

01:13:24.296 --> 01:13:27.251
"I don't blame you.

01:13:27.252 --> 01:13:28.315
"I blame the big, isolating,

"money-driven games industry that
wants you to think violence is cool,

01:13:33.316 --> 01:13:38.276
"because I think you all know,
in reality, it's not."

01:13:41.272 --> 01:13:43.248
How's that?

01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:47.283
That's good, Dad. Yeah?

01:13:47.284 --> 01:13:49.256
I think that'll be good. Yeah?

01:13:52.296 --> 01:13:53.312
Thank you.

01:13:56.264 --> 01:13:58.287
I love you, son.

01:13:58.288 --> 01:13:59.327
'At the FTC hearing, '

01:13:59.328 --> 01:14:03.271
if you are found guilty of
false representation, fraud,

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:06.311
eventually you could be looking at
a fine of many millions of dollars.

01:14:06.312 --> 01:14:09.303
It'll be the end of Rockstar Games
if they even go halfway...

01:14:09.304 --> 01:14:10.332
Fine. I get it. I do.

01:14:12.276 --> 01:14:15.283
It'll be a grilling and I'm going
to deal with it in my own way.

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:18.267
I'm going to explain to them exactly
what it is we do at Rockstar

01:14:18.268 --> 01:14:19.291
and how we make games

01:14:19.292 --> 01:14:22.255
because obviously they
don't have a fucking clue.

01:14:22.256 --> 01:14:25.332
OK. But please try
and be humble and serious.

01:14:28.304 --> 01:14:30.240
And please wear a suit.

01:14:31.296 --> 01:14:33.256
I just want it to be over now.

01:14:38.252 --> 01:14:39.256
Where's Jamie?

01:14:40.316 --> 01:14:43.311
How should I know?
Is he away somewhere?

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:45.324
He's not in San Diego
or Edinburgh, is he?

01:14:48.292 --> 01:14:50.272
He wasn't in yesterday either.

01:15:06.256 --> 01:15:08.279
Dan.
Just a tick.

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:10.271
Do you know where Jamie is?

01:15:10.272 --> 01:15:13.303
He's not been in for two days,
has he said anything to you?

01:15:13.304 --> 01:15:14.332
No, mate.

01:16:16.304 --> 01:16:17.324
Hello?

01:16:36.304 --> 01:16:37.308
Hi.

01:16:39.312 --> 01:16:40.328
Hi.

01:16:46.264 --> 01:16:50.295
The Florida Bar Association wants to
disbar me for unprofessional conduct.

01:16:50.296 --> 01:16:52.271
There's going to be a hearing.

01:16:52.272 --> 01:16:55.288
It's just the 31 charges that
I've got to defend myself against.

01:17:00.328 --> 01:17:02.316
Did I underestimate Blank Rome?

01:17:04.284 --> 01:17:05.312
Oh, Jack.

01:17:51.308 --> 01:17:54.239
Mr Houser.

01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:56.235
Good afternoon. This way, please.

01:17:56.236 --> 01:17:59.251
Thank you for coming, Mr Houser.

01:17:59.252 --> 01:18:02.327
We're here to ascertain exactly
how it is that the so-called

01:18:02.328 --> 01:18:06.300
Hot Coffee sex scene ended up
on the DVDs of San Andreas.

01:18:07.316 --> 01:18:11.235
I'm... I'm here to help
in any way I can.

01:18:11.236 --> 01:18:13.275
We have all your e-mail
correspondence on this matter

01:18:13.276 --> 01:18:14.328
over the last three years.

01:18:21.236 --> 01:18:24.252
You like to use profane language in
your e-mails, don't you, Mr Houser?

01:18:29.236 --> 01:18:30.516
Yeah, I'm very sorry about that.

01:18:32.256 --> 01:18:33.260
'Mr Thompson...'

01:18:34.284 --> 01:18:38.247
...I have reviewed over 2,000 pages
of submitted transcripts

01:18:38.248 --> 01:18:40.263
that contend you've abused
the legal system

01:18:40.264 --> 01:18:44.255
by submitting numerous frivolous
and inappropriate filings to court,

01:18:44.256 --> 01:18:46.315
that you've made false statements
to tribunals

01:18:46.316 --> 01:18:50.239
and that you've engaged in
incidents of libel and slander.

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:53.267
The fact is, Your Honour, most
of these accusations are laughable

01:18:53.268 --> 01:18:56.307
and motivated by a malicious desire
for revenge due to the civil case

01:18:56.308 --> 01:18:59.287
I recently brought
against their clients.

01:18:59.288 --> 01:19:02.291
Their accusations stretch
back over 20 years.

01:19:02.292 --> 01:19:05.299
That's the legal equivalent
of going through my trash.

01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:09.255
And more recently, did you write
to Judge James Moore in Alabama

01:19:09.256 --> 01:19:12.263
falsely accusing him of...

01:19:12.264 --> 01:19:16.255
"consorting with criminal bodies"?

01:19:16.256 --> 01:19:18.291
Your Honour, the real fact
of the matter is

01:19:18.292 --> 01:19:21.271
these people don't like me

01:19:21.272 --> 01:19:24.316
because I give them the truth
and it hurts like hell.

01:19:33.296 --> 01:19:35.331
Hey, man, it's me.

01:19:35.332 --> 01:19:39.251
Er, what's happening? How's it gone?

01:19:39.252 --> 01:19:42.252
You can't still be in there. Call
me. I want to know what's happening.

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:07.284
'Jack, it's Patti. Please give me
a call when you get out.'

01:20:24.308 --> 01:20:28.239
'According to the FTC,
Take-Two and Rockstar

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:32.263
'failed to notify consumers that
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

01:20:32.264 --> 01:20:36.283
'contained otherwise hidden nudity
and a sexually-themed mini game.'

01:20:36.284 --> 01:20:40.263
The settlement today requires
that the companies must now develop

01:20:40.264 --> 01:20:44.267
a system to ensure that all
game content is considered

01:20:44.268 --> 01:20:48.243
and reviewed before being submitted
to the ratings authority.

01:20:48.244 --> 01:20:49.283
'In other breaking news...'

01:20:49.284 --> 01:20:51.331
That's it? They got off.

'..As hurricane-force winds

Hey.

01:21:07.244 --> 01:21:08.248
Well done.

01:21:09.316 --> 01:21:12.256
Wrist slap, no fine,
mustn't happen again.

01:21:13.296 --> 01:21:15.296
Couldn't have hoped
for better than that.

01:21:18.292 --> 01:21:20.323
You were in there nine hours.

01:21:20.324 --> 01:21:21.328
Yep.

01:21:28.288 --> 01:21:31.239
I just heard Jack Thompson's
been permanently disbarred

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:33.295
from practising law.

01:21:33.296 --> 01:21:36.235
Maybe he'll leave us alone now.

01:21:36.236 --> 01:21:37.240
Maybe.

01:21:39.268 --> 01:21:41.239
But I doubt it.

01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:43.284
I thought you'd be pleased
to know you'd won.

01:21:49.284 --> 01:21:52.235
Don Simpson died of a heart attack
on the toilet

01:21:52.236 --> 01:21:54.287
with 21 different types of drugs
in his system

01:21:54.288 --> 01:21:56.287
and his trousers round his ankles.

01:21:56.288 --> 01:21:59.328
He'd had so much cosmetic surgery,
people said he barely looked human.

01:22:01.312 --> 01:22:03.252
He's your hero, he is.

01:22:19.304 --> 01:22:22.303
Today, I'm announcing,
along with my colleagues,

01:22:22.304 --> 01:22:26.271
the Family Entertainment
Protection Act.

01:22:26.272 --> 01:22:29.291
This bill will prohibit
the sale of violent

01:22:29.292 --> 01:22:32.319
and sexually explicit
video games to minors.

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:36.295
We need to treat violent video games
the way we treat tobacco,

01:22:36.296 --> 01:22:38.311
alcohol and pornography...

01:22:38.312 --> 01:22:41.307
And Governor Schwarzenegger
has banned the sale of violent games

01:22:41.308 --> 01:22:43.311
to minors in California.

01:22:43.312 --> 01:22:44.328
You are winning.

01:22:46.292 --> 01:22:48.319
What am I winning?

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:50.288
I've been permanently disbarred.

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:55.267
Families of those dead cops
haven't had justice.

01:22:55.268 --> 01:22:57.279
Rockstar Games got off scot-free.

01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:01.243
'We know that these products
are damaging to children...'

01:23:01.244 --> 01:23:02.264
What did I win?

01:23:03.304 --> 01:23:06.240
The law is changing.

01:23:09.268 --> 01:23:11.268
You're a special lady, Patti.

01:23:12.316 --> 01:23:13.324
Thank you.

01:23:16.304 --> 01:23:18.312
Thank you for always supporting me.

01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:50.292
Erm, excuse me.

01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:05.320
You want to let me in?

01:24:08.256 --> 01:24:09.276
No.

01:24:25.324 --> 01:24:27.259
Was this you running away?

01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:31.264
I don't remember the last time
I had any time to myself.

01:24:37.296 --> 01:24:40.243
Why are you here?

01:24:40.244 --> 01:24:41.300
We need you.

01:24:43.268 --> 01:24:45.319
I quit, Sam. I'm going to leave.

01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:49.243
Don't leave. I need a break.
Come here.

01:24:49.244 --> 01:24:50.248
Come here.

01:24:55.296 --> 01:25:00.283
You're one of the most important
people in my life. I need you.

01:25:00.284 --> 01:25:03.263
I'm still going to leave,
despite the nice hug.

01:25:03.264 --> 01:25:06.255
We're just having a bad time
right now cos people are using us

01:25:06.256 --> 01:25:08.307
as a political football, all right?
But that will change.

01:25:08.308 --> 01:25:12.307
And we'll get back to normal.
I don't want to go back to normal.

01:25:12.308 --> 01:25:16.255
The endless crunch times, running
between eight different studios,

01:25:16.256 --> 01:25:19.295
living on a plane and firing people.
It's your company, Sam. Not mine.

01:25:19.296 --> 01:25:22.267
Yeah, but you're a key part of it,
mate. I can't do it without you.

01:25:22.268 --> 01:25:25.255
But Rockstar belongs
to you and Dan and Terry.

01:25:25.256 --> 01:25:27.271
You get all the royalties.

01:25:27.272 --> 01:25:28.712
Do you want to give me some of them?

01:25:37.248 --> 01:25:39.240
I've been thinking
of quitting myself.

01:25:40.276 --> 01:25:42.256
Just stopping the whole thing.

01:25:44.284 --> 01:25:48.263
It's not fun any more.
You can't do that.

01:25:48.264 --> 01:25:52.295
Look, I can leave but you can't
because you're a proper pioneer, Sam.

01:25:52.296 --> 01:25:54.327
You're a genius.

01:25:54.328 --> 01:25:57.300
You're changing the way games
are perceived. I don't know, man.

01:25:58.328 --> 01:26:00.323
I don't even know what
I'm going to do next.

01:26:00.324 --> 01:26:03.311
You'll do your next game...

01:26:03.312 --> 01:26:05.256
and it'll be the best one yet.

01:26:06.296 --> 01:26:07.332
I know it will.

01:26:45.308 --> 01:26:47.252
Hey, what are you doing?!
