00:59.960 --> 01:02.628
OOH!

01:02.663 --> 01:05.798
IT'S CALLED "CELEBRATION CAKE."

01:05.833 --> 01:07.199
OOH, I CAN SEE WHY.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.600
AH, NO TOUCHING
UNTIL IT COOLS

01:08.636 --> 01:10.302
BECAUSE WE WANT IT...

01:10.337 --> 01:12.704
TO TURN OUT LIKE THIS.

01:12.740 --> 01:13.705
OH, THAT IS A BEAUTY.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.941
PHIL, GET A SHOT
OF THAT.

01:15.976 --> 01:17.276
MY DAD SAID
IT BROUGHT GOOD LUCK.

01:17.311 --> 01:19.878
HE USED TO BAKE IT
FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS...

01:19.914 --> 01:21.947
WEDDINGS, BIRTHDAYS,
GRADUATIONS,

01:21.982 --> 01:23.649
AND SOME MORNINGS,
I WOULD JUST WAKE UP,

01:23.684 --> 01:24.950
AND I WOULD SEE THE CAKE
ON THE KITCHEN TABLE,

01:24.985 --> 01:28.187
WHICH MEANT WE WOULD SKIP WORK
AND SCHOOL

01:28.222 --> 01:30.055
AND JUST CELEBRATE LIFE.

01:30.091 --> 01:32.991
WELL, I BET YOU WISH
YOU HAD A DAD LIKE THAT.

01:33.027 --> 01:33.859
ONE LUCKY AUDIENCE MEMBER

01:33.894 --> 01:35.828
IS GOING HOME
WITH THIS CAKE TODAY.

01:35.863 --> 01:36.995
YOU ALL SENT IN

01:37.031 --> 01:38.530
SOME AMAZING
CELEBRATION STORIES,

01:38.566 --> 01:39.865
HOPING TO WIN,

01:39.900 --> 01:40.699
BUT WE DECIDED

01:40.734 --> 01:42.734
WE ARE GOING
TO GIVE THE CAKE TO...

01:42.770 --> 01:45.504
MELISSA AND JACK,
FROM BAINBRIDGE ISLAND.

01:45.539 --> 01:46.872
THEY JUST HAD TWINS.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.173
CONGRATULATIONS,
MELISSA AND JACK.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.241
BILLIE?

01:49.276 --> 01:51.477
WHO GETS THE OTHER CAKE?

01:51.512 --> 01:52.845
WE DO,

01:52.880 --> 01:55.180
BECAUSE WE'RE ABOUT
TO START A NEW CHAPTER

01:55.216 --> 01:57.282
OF <i> WAKE UP, WEST COAST!</i>

02:03.791 --> 02:06.358
NOW, AS MOST
OF YOU KNOW,

02:06.393 --> 02:08.560
WE LOST OUR BELOVED
CO-HOST, LANIE HAYWOOD,

02:08.596 --> 02:09.595
THREE MONTHS AGO,

02:09.630 --> 02:11.563
AFTER A TRAGIC
REACTION

02:11.599 --> 02:12.731
TO HAZELNUT COFFEE.

02:12.766 --> 02:15.267
REMEMBER,
FOOD ALLERGIES ARE NO JOKE.

02:15.302 --> 02:18.370
LANIE WAS BY MY SIDE
FOR 10 YEARS,

02:18.405 --> 02:20.906
WAKING US UP
WITH A SMILE AND A STORY.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.574
LETTING HER GO
HAS NOT BEEN EASY,

02:22.610 --> 02:24.510
BUT THANKS TO YOU,

02:24.545 --> 02:26.178
OUR LOYAL VIEWERS,

02:26.213 --> 02:29.581
AND BILLIE BLESSINGS,
OUR RESIDENT FOOD EXPERT,

02:29.617 --> 02:31.083
WE'RE STILL GOING STRONG.

02:31.118 --> 02:33.552
IN FACT, I THINK
WE'RE STRONGER THAN EVER.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.387
YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT
MAKES OUR SHOW SPECIAL--

02:35.422 --> 02:36.788
WE'RE A FAMILY,

02:36.824 --> 02:38.257
AND FAMILIES TAKE CARE
OF EACH OTHER.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.758
AND TOMORROW,

02:39.793 --> 02:42.094
OUR EXECUTIVE PRODUCER,
RUDY SLATER...

02:42.129 --> 02:43.362
THERE HE IS!
RUDY, WAVE!

02:43.397 --> 02:46.598
HE'LL BE INTRODUCING
OUR NEW CO-HOST.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.200
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHO THAT IS?

02:48.235 --> 02:50.135
THEN SET THOSE ALARMS,
EVERYBODY,

02:50.171 --> 02:52.471
BECAUSE TOMORROW MORNING,
YOU'RE GOING FIND OUT!

02:52.506 --> 02:53.338
THANK YOU FOR THAT
SPECTACULAR CAKE.

02:53.374 --> 02:56.542
WELL, DON'T BE AFRAID
TO TRY IT AT HOME,

02:56.577 --> 02:58.710
AND REMEMBER,
YOU CAN'T BUY HAPPINESS,

02:58.746 --> 02:59.745
BUT YOU CAN BAKE IT.

02:59.780 --> 03:00.779
CHEERS TO THAT.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.317
AND WE'RE OFF.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.152
WHO IS IN CHARGE
OF MY TELEPROMPTER?

03:07.188 --> 03:08.287
IT'S TOO SLOW.
I CAN'T...

03:08.322 --> 03:09.922
YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:09.957 --> 03:11.790
WHAT'S EATING LANCE?

03:11.825 --> 03:12.791
OH, HE'S JUST MAD

03:12.826 --> 03:14.593
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHO THE NEW CO-HOST IS.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.061
WELL, NOBODY DOES.

03:16.096 --> 03:17.396
LANCE HAS BEEN AROUND
THE LONGEST.

03:17.431 --> 03:18.630
HE THOUGHT
HE SHOULD HAVE A SAY.

03:19.800 --> 03:20.999
IF IT WERE UP TO LANCE,

03:21.035 --> 03:22.467
HE'D CLONE HIMSELF
AND CO-HOST

03:22.503 --> 03:24.069
WITH HIS FAVORITE PERSON
IN THE WORLD.

03:24.104 --> 03:26.004
BE NICE.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.273
IT'S YOU, ISN'T IT?

03:28.309 --> 03:30.609
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHO THE NEW CO-HOST IS.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.811
YOU'RE THE ONLY REASON
PEOPLE STILL WATCH THIS SHOW,

03:32.846 --> 03:34.012
SINCE LANIE DIED.

03:34.048 --> 03:35.080
LET'S KEEP IT POSITIVE.

03:35.115 --> 03:36.114
I AM POSITIVE.

03:36.150 --> 03:37.649
I JUST CALL IT LIKE I SEE IT.

03:37.685 --> 03:39.251
WELL, WE'LL ALL FIND OUT
LATER ON TONIGHT

03:39.286 --> 03:41.787
WHEN RUDY TELLS US
AT DINNER.

03:41.822 --> 03:44.289
HAVE EITHER OF YOU SEEN
ANY OF THE SOUND GUYS?

03:44.325 --> 03:45.624
SOMETHING'S GOING WRONG
WITH THE EQUIPMENT.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.159
GRETCHEN AND RUDY
WENT UP TO HIS OFFICE

03:47.194 --> 03:48.260
AFTER THE SHOW.

03:48.295 --> 03:49.628
RUDY'S HEADSET
MUST BE ON.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.396
NOBODY CAN FIGURE OUT
HOW TO TURN IT OFF.

03:53.234 --> 03:54.132
<i>YOU ARE NOT HIRING
THAT WOMAN.</i>

03:54.168 --> 03:55.367
<i>OVER MY DEAD BODY.</i>

03:55.402 --> 03:57.002
OH, SOMEBODY
MUST HAVE PATCHED THAT.

03:57.037 --> 03:59.304
RUDY'S HEADSET SHOULD NEVER
COME THROUGH THAT SPEAKER.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.039
IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO
TO THE CONTROL ROOM.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.541
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
LET THEM KNOW.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.109
<i>I WILL DESTROY THIS SHOW.</i>

04:04.144 --> 04:06.745
SO, KIKI...
YOU'RE RUDY'S ASSISTANT, RIGHT?

04:07.881 --> 04:09.648
I AM NOT GOING IN THERE.

04:09.683 --> 04:12.184
BILLIE IS THE ONLY ONE
HE ACTUALLY LIKES.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.954
WELL, THANKS
FOR THAT VOTE OF CONFIDENCE.

04:16.991 --> 04:18.957
AHEM.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.392
I PROMISE YOU.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.628
HOW MANY TIMES

04:22.663 --> 04:24.062
DO I HAVE TO HEAR
THE SAME STORY?

04:24.098 --> 04:25.831
I AM SO SICK AND TIRED OF THIS.

04:25.866 --> 04:26.732
DO NOT CROSS ME!

04:26.767 --> 04:28.834
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF DOING.

04:29.870 --> 04:30.836
WHAT IS IT?

04:30.871 --> 04:31.903
YOUR MIC IS ON.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.705
WE CAN HEAR YOU GUYS IN THE SET.

04:35.009 --> 04:36.708
OH, PERFECT.

04:38.178 --> 04:39.077
THIS IS GREAT.

04:39.113 --> 04:40.812
WHAT JOKER WAS RESPONSIBLE
FOR THAT, HUH?

04:40.848 --> 04:42.347
DON'T PRETEND
LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW.

04:42.383 --> 04:43.715
WAS THAT YOUR GOAL

04:43.751 --> 04:44.850
WHEN YOU GOT UP
THIS MORNING?

04:44.885 --> 04:47.252
TO SEE HOW MANY WAYS
I CAN HUMILIATE GRETCHEN TODAY?

04:47.288 --> 04:48.687
MAYBE YOU WERE THE ONE
THAT LEFT THE MIC ON,

04:48.722 --> 04:50.922
JUST TO LET EVERYBODY
KNOW WHO'S IN CHARGE.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.824
I AM IN CHARGE, RUDY.

04:52.860 --> 04:53.892
I AM THE PRESIDENT
OF PROGRAMMING.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.260
YOU DON'T HAVE
THE AUTHORITY

04:55.296 --> 04:57.396
TO HIRE A CO-HOST
WITHOUT MY APPROVAL.

04:57.431 --> 04:58.497
YOU WORK FOR ME.

04:58.532 --> 05:00.198
ACTUALLY,
I WORK FOR YOUR FATHER.

05:03.437 --> 05:04.736
YOU WENT TO MY FATHER?

05:04.772 --> 05:06.872
HE SIGNED THE CONTRACT
THIS MORNING.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.043
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
BREAK UP WITH ME?

05:11.078 --> 05:11.843
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN CLEANER.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.254
YOU KNOW,
YOU WOULD HAVE MADE MY LIFE

05:22.289 --> 05:23.121
A WHOLE LOT EASIER

05:23.157 --> 05:24.456
IF YOU HAD AGREED
TO BE THE CO-HOST

05:24.491 --> 05:25.524
WHEN I FIRST ASKED YOU.

05:25.559 --> 05:26.858
I TOLD YOU,
I HAVE TOO MUCH TO DO.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.260
COME ON, WHO DOESN'T
WANT TO BE A STAR

05:28.295 --> 05:29.294
OF THEIR OWN
TELEVISION SHOW?

05:29.330 --> 05:30.529
LOOK, I RUN
MY OWN RESTAURANT,

05:30.564 --> 05:31.930
AND I LIKE TEACHING
PEOPLE HOW TO COOK.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.031
WELL, GOOD DEEDS

05:33.067 --> 05:34.132
MAKE GOOD
REFRIGERATOR MAGNETS,

05:34.168 --> 05:35.267
AND NOBODY PAYS
ANY ATTENTION

05:35.302 --> 05:36.601
TO EITHER OF THOSE.

05:36.637 --> 05:37.703
ARE WE STILL ON
FOR THAT DINNER TONIGHT?

05:37.738 --> 05:38.870
YEAH, SURE.
WHY WOULDN'T WE BE?

05:38.906 --> 05:40.439
SEEMED LIKE
IT MIGHT BE CANCELED.

05:40.474 --> 05:43.275
MISS BLESSINGS HAS SUGGESTED
THAT I UPDATE YOU ON DINNER.

05:43.310 --> 05:45.377
SO HERE IT IS.

05:45.412 --> 05:46.611
NOW WE ALL KNOW

05:46.647 --> 05:48.647
THAT GRETCHEN IS NOT VERY HAPPY
ABOUT LANIE'S REPLACEMENT,

05:48.682 --> 05:50.482
BUT SOMEONE ELSE HERE IS TRYING

05:50.517 --> 05:52.651
TO KEEP ME
FROM HIRING A CO-HOST.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.152
THAT LITTLE STUNT
WITH THE MICROPHONE

05:54.188 --> 05:55.987
IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

05:56.023 --> 05:59.124
WHOEVER IS TRYING
TO SABOTAGE MY SHOW,

05:59.159 --> 06:00.726
WHEN I FIND OUT
WHO YOU ARE,

06:00.761 --> 06:02.094
YOU'RE FIRED.

06:02.129 --> 06:02.994
OKAY THEN.

06:05.366 --> 06:06.965
WHY DO I SUDDENLY FEEL
LIKE STAYING HOME?

06:08.435 --> 06:10.435
YOUR AUNT CALLED
WHILE YOU WERE IN RUDY'S OFFICE.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.304
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO MEET HER
AT THE FARMER'S MARKET

06:12.339 --> 06:13.338
30 MINUTES AGO.

06:13.374 --> 06:14.840
I COMPLETELY FORGOT.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.109
YOU LEFT YOUR PHONE
IN THE DRESSING ROOM,

06:17.144 --> 06:18.076
AND YOUR BAG...

06:18.112 --> 06:19.111
OKAY.

06:19.146 --> 06:21.146
ALSO YOUR CAR KEYS.

06:21.181 --> 06:23.115
DID YOU WANT ME TO TAKE THE CAKE
TO THE RESTAURANT FOR YOU?

06:23.150 --> 06:25.951
NO, I WANT YOU TO BE
MY ASSISTANT INSTEAD OF RUDY'S

06:25.986 --> 06:27.919
BECAUSE CLEARLY
I HAVE A GREATER NEED.

06:27.955 --> 06:28.787
SORRY, I GOT DIBS.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.790
SEE YOU LATER.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.326
NO?

06:41.001 --> 06:43.101
THAT IS A THING OF BEAUTY.

06:43.137 --> 06:43.969
THAT'S A HYBRID.

06:44.004 --> 06:44.970
HOW MUCH?

06:45.005 --> 06:46.505
FOR YOU?
$3.00 A POUND.

06:46.540 --> 06:47.539
TWO.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.041
NOBODY'S GOT TOMATOES
LIKE THESE.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.677
$2.00, AND I'LL TAKE A BOX.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.047
I'M SO SORRY I'M LATE.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.182
HEY, GIL.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.717
HEY, BILLIE.

06:58.752 --> 06:59.718
$2.00.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.319
FOR YOU.

07:01.355 --> 07:02.487
AND WHAT ELSE?

07:02.523 --> 07:03.655
OH, HERE'S A LIST.

07:06.026 --> 07:06.992
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.

07:07.027 --> 07:09.561
NO, YOU DON'T WANT
TO KNOW WHAT I'M THINKING.

07:09.596 --> 07:13.165
YOU DON'T LIKE THE SHOW,

07:13.200 --> 07:15.233
EVERYBODY IN TELEVISION
IS SELF-ABSORBED,

07:15.269 --> 07:16.802
AND IT'S TAKING ME AWAY
FROM THE RESTAURANT.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.036
WELL, IT IS
TAKING YOU AWAY

07:18.071 --> 07:19.004
FROM THE RESTAURANT.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.105
AUNT CASSANDRA,

07:20.140 --> 07:21.473
WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING
TO KEEP THIS RESTAURANT OPEN

07:21.508 --> 07:22.507
FOR 12 YEARS.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.409
IN THE THREE YEARS
SINCE I'VE BEEN ON THE SHOW,

07:24.445 --> 07:25.377
WE HAVE WAIT LISTS.

07:25.412 --> 07:26.411
NO, WE HAVE
WAIT LISTS

07:26.447 --> 07:28.146
'CAUSE YOU WROTE
A COOKBOOK.

07:28.182 --> 07:31.049
YES, WHICH I GET
TO SHARE EVERY MORNING.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.751
I THINK
IT HELPS PEOPLE.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.220
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU WENT ON A DATE?

07:35.255 --> 07:37.556
HOW DID WE GET
FROM "I'M SORRY I'M LATE,"

07:37.591 --> 07:38.557
TO DATES?

07:38.592 --> 07:40.225
LOOK, I KNOW THE SHOW'S
GOOD FOR THE RESTAURANT.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.393
I JUST DON'T THINK

07:41.428 --> 07:44.029
THAT RUDY
APPRECIATES YOU.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.063
RUDY IS MY FRIEND.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.097
HE BROUGHT ME ON

07:46.133 --> 07:48.400
BECAUSE HE BELIEVES
IN THE BOOK.

07:48.435 --> 07:49.935
HE CARES
ABOUT THE MESSAGE.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.436
RUDY CARES ABOUT HIMSELF.

07:51.472 --> 07:52.938
TV PEOPLE
JUST WANT TO BE FAMOUS.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.139
OH, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THEM.

07:55.576 --> 07:56.942
ARE THOSE TURNIPS?

07:56.977 --> 07:58.944
OH, YEAH, MAURICE HAD
A DREAM LAST NIGHT.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.346
HE WAS STANDING IN
A FIELD OF TURNIPS.

08:01.381 --> 08:04.249
AUNT CASSANDRA,
NOBODY LIKES TURNIPS.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.450
THEY TASTE
LIKE MEDICINE.

08:05.486 --> 08:06.551
YOU KNOW
WHAT HE'S LIKE

08:06.587 --> 08:07.719
WHEN HE GETS UPSET.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.054
WHY IS MAURICE UPSET?

08:09.089 --> 08:10.021
HE THINKS

08:10.057 --> 08:11.857
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO
CLOSE THE RESTAURANT.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.191
WHAT?

08:13.227 --> 08:14.125
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID
THIS MORNING.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.026
HE THINKS

08:15.062 --> 08:16.261
THAT RUDY'S GOING
TO MAKE YOU CO-HOST

08:16.296 --> 08:16.995
AND THAT YOU'RE
GOING TO SELL.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.564
I AM NOT SELLING
THE RESTAURANT,

08:19.600 --> 08:20.699
AND I TOLD RUDY,

08:20.734 --> 08:22.133
I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO BE THE CO-HOST.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.134
WELL, DON'T
LOOK AT ME.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.736
I'M NOT THE ONE
COOKING TURNIPS.

08:30.944 --> 08:31.910
UGH.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.381
TA-DAH!

08:37.951 --> 08:39.551
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:39.586 --> 08:41.285
MAURICE INVENTED
A NEW RECIPE.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.054
IT CAME TO ME IN A DREAM.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.489
JUAN AND KIKI
ARE HELPING ME TEST.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.424
THIS MIGHT NOT BE
THE BEST NIGHT

08:46.460 --> 08:47.425
TO TRY A NEW RECIPE.

08:47.461 --> 08:48.426
WE'RE COMPLETELY BOOKED.

08:48.462 --> 08:49.828
PLUS, REMEMBER?

08:49.863 --> 08:50.795
IT'S RUDY'S DINNER.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.230
WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT
ABOUT THE CO-HOST?

08:52.266 --> 08:53.698
JUST TASTE.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.302
CHEF INCREDIBLE
IS MAKING MAGIC.

08:58.372 --> 08:59.304
YOU HATE IT.

08:59.339 --> 09:02.674
"HATE" IS A STRONG WORD.

09:02.709 --> 09:03.909
IT WAS
A LITTLE BITTER.

09:05.312 --> 09:06.478
I'M JUST A BARTENDER.

09:06.513 --> 09:09.114
I DON'T NORMALLY EAT
VEGETABLES.

09:11.285 --> 09:13.418
FEATHERS, BUDDY,
HOW YOU DOING?

09:13.453 --> 09:15.320
YOU STAY. YOU STAY.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.755
THAT'S A GOOD DOG.
YEAH, THAT'S MY BABY.

09:16.790 --> 09:19.791
OH! OH... OH!

09:19.826 --> 09:20.959
HMM.

09:20.994 --> 09:23.528
OH.

09:23.564 --> 09:25.764
FEATHERS MIGHT NOT BE
THE BEST JUDGE, MAURICE.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.098
JUST NEEDS A LITTLE WORK,
THAT'S ALL.

09:29.836 --> 09:32.070
MAURICE, YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT, RIGHT?

09:33.574 --> 09:35.440
SURE.

09:35.475 --> 09:37.676
WELL, THIS HAS BEEN
A STRESSFUL PERIOD,

09:37.711 --> 09:39.844
BUT I PROMISE,
AFTER TONIGHT,

09:39.880 --> 09:41.346
EVERYTHING IS GOING
TO GO BACK TO NORMAL, OKAY?

09:45.018 --> 09:46.685
OKAY.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.788
THAT'S A GOOD BOY.
THAT'S A GOOD BOY.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.332
AFTERNOON,
MR. SLATER.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.033
YOU HAVE A PACKAGE.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.301
OH, YEAH?
WHAT IS IT.

10:03.337 --> 10:04.803
LOOKS LIKE A CAKE.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.338
HUH.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.509
YOU'RE WELCOME.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.662
HEY, IT'S ME.

10:30.697 --> 10:33.198
I'VE GOT THE CONTRACT.
EVERYTHING LOOKS GREAT.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.199
SHE WAS A LITTLE UPSET.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.534
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE CAN BE LIKE,

10:36.570 --> 10:39.137
BUT DON'T WORRY,
EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL.

10:40.574 --> 10:42.540
WELL, WHY DON'T WE SAY...

10:42.576 --> 10:44.542
HALF AN HOUR FROM NOW?

10:44.578 --> 10:45.577
OKAY...

10:45.612 --> 10:46.778
AND LISTEN...

10:46.813 --> 10:49.381
EVERYTHING IS GOING
TO BE GREAT, HUH?

10:49.416 --> 10:50.849
OKAY. BYE.

10:58.392 --> 11:00.025
MM.

11:23.150 --> 11:24.082
UM...

11:24.117 --> 11:27.318
I DECIDED NOT TO SERVE
THE TURNIPS TONIGHT,

11:27.354 --> 11:29.087
BUT I'M NOT GIVING UP.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.088
BLESSINGS
IN THE KITCHEN,

11:30.123 --> 11:31.289
CHAPTER ONE,

11:31.324 --> 11:33.825
"ALL GREAT CHEFS
TAKE WHISKS."

11:33.860 --> 11:35.460
YOU KNOW THAT'S A TERRIBLE PUN.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.429
HASN'T STOPPED PEOPLE FROM
BUYING COOKBOOKS, THOUGH.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.963
YEAH.

11:41.702 --> 11:42.767
DID RUDY GET HERE YET?

11:42.803 --> 11:44.102
NO, AND HIS ASSISTANT,

11:44.137 --> 11:45.937
SHE'S PRETTY PANICKED
EVEN FOR HER.

11:45.972 --> 11:46.938
HER NAME'S KIKI.

11:46.973 --> 11:47.839
YOU SEE HER
THREE TIMES A WEEK.

11:47.874 --> 11:50.608
OH, AND HIS FIANCEE
ISN'T HERE YET EITHER.

11:50.644 --> 11:52.510
YOU KNOW, THE...
THE FUN ONE.

11:52.546 --> 11:53.478
THEY HAD A BIG
FIGHT THIS MORNING.

11:53.513 --> 11:54.312
YEAH,
WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED?

11:54.347 --> 11:56.948
TABLE TWO, AND NO
SCALOPPINI TONIGHT.

11:56.983 --> 11:58.349
OH, BOY.
THAT'S THE HEAD OF THE NETWORK.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.118
WHAT AM I GOING
TO TELL HIM ABOUT RUDY?

12:02.489 --> 12:03.455
BILLIE BLESSINGS.

12:03.490 --> 12:04.856
MY FAVORITE CHEF.

12:04.891 --> 12:05.757
I'M SO GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT.

12:05.792 --> 12:06.858
MAKE IT?

12:06.893 --> 12:07.859
I'VE BEEN WAITING
THREE MONTHS

12:07.894 --> 12:09.094
FOR RUDY TO PICK
A NEW CO-HOST.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.261
LET'S GET IT
OVER WITH!

12:10.297 --> 12:11.663
AND WHO IS THIS?

12:11.698 --> 12:15.100
THIS IS MY AUNT,
CASSANDRA SHAW.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.534
AUNT CASSANDRA,
THIS IS VERNON DIVOSS.

12:16.570 --> 12:17.669
OH, BILLIE.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.104
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
YOU WERE RELATED

12:19.139 --> 12:19.938
TO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
IN THE WORLD.

12:21.675 --> 12:23.875
DOES THAT LINE
USUALLY WORK FOR YOU?

12:26.246 --> 12:27.712
A STRAIGHT-SHOOTER,
JUST LIKE YOUR NIECE.

12:27.748 --> 12:28.513
I HOPE YOU'RE PROUD OF HER.

12:28.548 --> 12:30.115
SHE'S THE BEST
PART OF THE SHOW.

12:31.218 --> 12:33.818
WHY DON'T WE JUST GO ON IN?

12:33.854 --> 12:35.553
WE'LL TALK.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.288
HMM!

12:37.324 --> 12:38.523
TV PEOPLE.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.060
WELL, WHERE THE HECK IS RUDY?

12:42.095 --> 12:43.661
TOO IMPORTANT TO SHOW UP
AT HIS OWN DINNER?

12:43.697 --> 12:44.662
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT?

12:44.698 --> 12:46.531
THANK YOU.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.032
- HAVE YOU HEARD FROM HIM?
- NO.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.033
WHY ISN'T HE HERE?

12:49.069 --> 12:51.469
I'VE TRIED
ALL HIS NUMBERS.

12:51.505 --> 12:52.971
DO YOU THINK GRETCHEN
CANCELED THE SHOW?

12:53.006 --> 12:55.807
NO, SHE CAN'T DO THAT
WITHOUT HER FATHER'S CONSENT.

12:57.511 --> 12:58.843
FINALLY.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.478
OH, HEY,
EVERYBODY.

13:00.514 --> 13:01.646
HEY, SORRY I'M LATE.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.181
I, UH...

13:03.216 --> 13:05.817
HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE
DRIVING MY CAR.

13:05.852 --> 13:07.352
ACTUALLY, BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

13:07.387 --> 13:09.053
I HAD A BIT OF TROUBLE
FINDING MY CAR.

13:15.962 --> 13:16.995
WHEN I BOUGHT THIS CHANNEL,

13:17.030 --> 13:18.830
I HAD A DREAM.

13:18.865 --> 13:20.932
RUDY SLATER
MADE THAT DREAM COME TRUE,

13:20.967 --> 13:22.734
BY PRODUCING A SHOW

13:22.769 --> 13:24.936
THAT BROUGHT US
NATIONAL ATTENTION.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.505
LET'S HOPE OUR NEW CO-HOST
CAN MAKE US EVEN BIGGER.

13:27.541 --> 13:28.773
RUDY.

13:32.746 --> 13:34.045
THANK YOU, VERNON.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.248
UM...

13:37.284 --> 13:38.883
THIS AFTERNOON,

13:38.919 --> 13:40.084
DESPITE MANY ATTEMPTS

13:40.120 --> 13:41.085
TO KEEP IT
FROM HAPPENING,

13:41.121 --> 13:43.922
A NEW CO-HOST
SIGNED A CONTRACT

13:43.957 --> 13:45.857
TO JOIN
<i>WAKE UP WEST COAST.</i>

13:45.892 --> 13:48.259
NOW,
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT,

13:48.295 --> 13:51.296
SHE'S A PART OF OUR FAMILY NOW,

13:51.331 --> 13:52.230
AND IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.399
MM?

13:54.434 --> 13:56.935
STARTING TONIGHT,

13:56.970 --> 14:00.705
OUR SHOW
IS ON A NEW PATH.

14:04.578 --> 14:06.911
RUDY?

14:06.947 --> 14:07.946
YOU OKAY?

14:10.350 --> 14:11.482
IT'S OKAY.
TAKE IT EASY!

14:13.687 --> 14:14.586
SOMEBODY CALL 911!

14:14.621 --> 14:15.553
TAKE IT EASY.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.095
IS HE REALLY DEAD?

14:24.130 --> 14:25.763
I'D SAY THAT'S AFFIRMATIVE.

14:25.799 --> 14:29.067
OH, HE SEEMED
SO HEALTHY.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.502
GUYS LIKE THAT, MAN,
HARD DRIVING...

14:31.538 --> 14:32.670
SOMETIMES, THEY JUST DROP.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.138
BILLIE BLESSINGS?

14:34.174 --> 14:35.139
YOU OWN THIS RESTAURANT?

14:35.175 --> 14:36.908
YES.

14:36.943 --> 14:37.675
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CLOSE.

14:37.711 --> 14:38.810
CLOSE?

14:38.845 --> 14:40.078
WE NEED TO SEARCH
THE PREMISES.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.913
BUT WE'RE STILL SERVING DINNER.

14:41.948 --> 14:44.115
THE EMTs DID
A PRELIMINARY TOX SCREEN.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.817
IT APPEARS
THAT RUDY SLATER WAS POISONED.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.988
CYANIDE.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.656
I'M HAPPY TO MAKE
THE ANNOUNCEMENT MYSELF,

14:51.691 --> 14:52.924
BUT IT MIGHT BE
LESS UPSETTING

14:52.959 --> 14:53.725
COMING FROM YOU.

14:58.865 --> 15:01.032
SO VERY SORRY
ABOUT THIS.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.301
YOU COME BACK
ANY TIME.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.503
DINNER WILL BE ON US,

15:05.538 --> 15:06.671
AND DON'T YOU WORRY.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.873
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE FINE.

15:08.909 --> 15:10.275
OKAY?

15:15.582 --> 15:16.381
WE'RE HOLDING THE STAFF

15:16.416 --> 15:17.949
AND THE PEOPLE
FROM THE PRIVATE PARTY,

15:17.984 --> 15:19.817
EXCEPT THE GUY
WHO OWNS THE NETWORK.

15:19.853 --> 15:21.152
WE ALREADY QUESTIONED HIM.

15:21.187 --> 15:22.954
BILLIE BLESSINGS!

15:22.989 --> 15:24.122
MY WIFE LOVES HER.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.990
GOT ALL THESE QUOTES
UP ON THE FRIDGE.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.825
"STIR UP YOUR COURAGE."
"BAKE A FRIEND."

15:27.861 --> 15:29.560
I'LL INTERVIEW HER.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.796
WHAT,
YOU GOT A CELEBRITY CRUSH?

15:31.831 --> 15:32.964
IT'S A LONG LIST.

15:32.999 --> 15:35.400
WHY DON'T YOU
GET STARTED?

15:35.435 --> 15:37.268
SOMEONE LOST
HIS SENSE OF HUMOR.

15:38.405 --> 15:39.170
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.

15:39.205 --> 15:41.806
THEY CANNOT KEEP US HERE
ALL NIGHT.

15:41.841 --> 15:43.408
I NEED MY SLEEP.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.909
CLEARLY, THE MOST
IMPORTANT PROBLEM WE FACE

15:44.945 --> 15:46.044
RIGHT NOW.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.979
WELL, SOME OF US HAVE TO DO
A SHOW TOMORROW, PHILLIP.

15:48.014 --> 15:50.682
THERE MIGHT NOT BE
A SHOW TOMORROW.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.684
I STILL CAN'T
REACH GRETCHEN.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.720
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

15:55.755 --> 15:56.821
IAN?

15:57.924 --> 15:59.324
HEY, BILLIE.

16:00.727 --> 16:01.859
IS THERE SOME PLACE WE CAN TALK?

16:01.895 --> 16:03.828
SURE.

16:03.863 --> 16:04.862
FOLLOW ME.

16:04.898 --> 16:07.398
MY OFFICE
IS UPSTAIRS.

16:07.434 --> 16:09.834
I GUESS
THEY KNOW EACH OTHER.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.669
MM.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.541
HER FATHER WAS A COP
BEFORE HE OPENED THE RESTAURANT.

16:16.576 --> 16:20.178
IAN...
WAS HIS PARTNER.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.447
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.049
WE SHOULD FIND
BETTER WAYS TO MEET.

16:25.085 --> 16:26.684
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME?

16:26.720 --> 16:28.386
THE NIGHT WE OPENED.

16:28.421 --> 16:29.554
RIGHT.

16:29.589 --> 16:30.421
WE WERE ALL SURPRISED.

16:30.457 --> 16:34.025
EDDIE BLESSINGS,
STARTING A RESTAURANT.

16:34.060 --> 16:35.893
IT WAS REALLY THE ONLY THING
ON HIS BUCKET LIST

16:35.929 --> 16:37.228
AFTER HE RETIRED.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.698
YOU STILL SEEING THAT GUY?
THE FUTURE SENATOR?

16:42.302 --> 16:43.468
NOT FOR A WHILE.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.903
OH.

16:45.939 --> 16:47.972
I SEE YOU
ON THAT MORNING SHOW SOMETIMES.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.707
YOU'RE GOOD.

16:56.616 --> 16:57.815
HOW'S YOUR WIFE?

16:57.851 --> 16:58.850
EX-WIFE.

17:00.420 --> 17:01.386
OH, I'M SORRY.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.588
NO, IT'S OKAY.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.256
WE HAVE A GREAT KID.
EMMA.

17:05.290 --> 17:06.991
EIGHT YEARS OLD.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.459
SHE ALREADY READS FASTER
THAN I DO.

17:12.432 --> 17:13.297
IS THIS AWKWARD?

17:13.333 --> 17:14.832
NO.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.567
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASIER
TO TALK TO ME

17:16.603 --> 17:18.368
THAN SOME STRANGER.

17:19.939 --> 17:21.939
DO YOU REALLY THINK
RUDY WAS MURDERED?

17:21.974 --> 17:23.473
WELL, IT'S HARD
TO GET CYANIDE POISONING

17:23.510 --> 17:24.442
BY ACCIDENT.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.511
CYANIDE.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.179
IT USUALLY GETS MISSED.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.113
LOOKS LIKE A HEART ATTACK,

17:29.149 --> 17:30.748
ANAPHYLAXIS.

17:30.784 --> 17:33.084
ONE OF THE EMTs
SMELLED ALMONDS.

17:33.119 --> 17:34.819
MOST PEOPLE CAN'T SMELL CYANIDE,
GENETICALLY.

17:36.790 --> 17:38.956
IN A WAY,
YOUR FRIEND'S LUCKY.

17:38.992 --> 17:42.193
AT LEAST WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

17:42.228 --> 17:43.428
NOW WE CAN FIND HIS KILLER.

17:48.668 --> 17:51.402
<i>RUDY SLATER, WHO DROPPED DEAD
AT BLESSINGS' KITC</i>

17:51.438 --> 17:52.937
<i>A POPULAR BISTRO OWNED</i>

17:52.972 --> 17:54.238
<i>BY THE COOKING EXPERT</i>

17:54.274 --> 17:56.574
<i>ON HIS AWARD-WINNING
MORNING SHOW.</i>

17:56.609 --> 17:58.242
<i>THE RESTAURANT
WAS CLOSED BY POLICE</i>

17:58.278 --> 17:59.977
<i>IN A BIZARRE CASE
OF FOOD POISONING</i>

18:00.013 --> 18:01.746
<i>THAT COULD BE MURDER.</i>

18:05.418 --> 18:07.752
HI, BABY!

18:09.422 --> 18:10.955
LOOK WHAT I GOT!

18:15.628 --> 18:16.627
YOU USED
TO DO THIS FOR ME

18:16.663 --> 18:18.996
ALL THE TIME
WHEN I COULDN'T SLEEP.

18:19.032 --> 18:21.232
WELL, TONIGHT,
I'M DOING IT FOR ME,

18:21.267 --> 18:23.134
AND IF YOU'RE NICE,

18:23.169 --> 18:23.968
I MIGHT SHARE.

18:26.306 --> 18:29.474
SO WHAT DID IAN SAY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?

18:29.509 --> 18:31.142
DO THEY HAVE ANY SUSPECTS?

18:31.177 --> 18:32.977
I DON'T THINK SO.

18:33.012 --> 18:35.480
HE ASKED IF I KNEW ANYBODY
WHO WOULD WANT TO KILL RUDY.

18:35.515 --> 18:36.414
IT'S HARD TO THINK

18:36.449 --> 18:38.282
OF SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T WANT
TO KILL RUDY.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.450
AUNT CASSANDRA.

18:39.486 --> 18:40.618
I KNOW
YOU LOVED HIM,

18:40.653 --> 18:43.254
BUT THE MAN WAS MURDERED.

18:46.860 --> 18:48.960
SO, WHAT WAS IT LIKE?

18:48.995 --> 18:50.995
SEEING IAN AGAIN?

18:51.030 --> 18:52.096
WHY?

18:52.132 --> 18:53.965
DON'T YOU "WHY" ME.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.634
YOU GUYS WERE HIGH
SCHOOL SWEETHEARTS.

18:56.669 --> 18:59.303
YOU WENT TO PROM
TOGETHER.

18:59.339 --> 19:00.705
PROM WAS YEARS AGO,

19:00.740 --> 19:02.473
AND SOME OF US
HAVE MOVED ON.

19:02.509 --> 19:04.008
OH, PLEASE.

19:04.043 --> 19:05.610
REMEMBER WHEN WE OPENED
THE RESTAURANT,

19:05.645 --> 19:08.045
AND HE BROUGHT
THAT GIRLFRIEND OF HIS?

19:08.081 --> 19:11.282
I SAW THE WAY YOU GUYS
LOOKED AT EACH OTHER.

19:11.317 --> 19:12.683
IT TOOK EVERYTHING I HAD
NOT TO TELL HIM

19:12.719 --> 19:13.784
HE WAS MAKING

19:13.820 --> 19:14.886
THE BIGGEST MISTAKE
OF HIS LIFE.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.787
FIRST OF ALL,
I WAS ENGAGED,

19:16.823 --> 19:18.723
AND HE ENDED UP
MARRYING THAT GIRLFRIEND.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.458
AND HOW DID THAT WORK OUT
FOR BOTH OF YOU?

19:20.493 --> 19:22.393
I HOPE
YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO FIX US UP.

19:22.428 --> 19:25.530
OH, HONEY,
IF I WAS TRYING TO FIX YOU UP,

19:25.565 --> 19:26.764
I'D JUST COME RIGHT OUT
AND SAY IT.

19:30.837 --> 19:34.205
YOU KNOW, RUDY NEVER SAID
WHO THE NEW CO-HOST WAS.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.606
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO START
TOMORROW.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.644
WELL, MAYBE
THEY'LL CANCEL THE SHOW.

19:47.787 --> 19:48.819
WELL, I SUPPOSE
YOU KNOW

19:48.855 --> 19:49.921
WE ARE STILL GOING ON.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.155
I SUGGESTED
WE CANCEL,

19:51.191 --> 19:52.190
BUT DOES ANYONE
EVER LISTEN TO ME?

19:52.225 --> 19:54.325
NO, I'VE GOT ONE.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.993
GRETCHEN SAYS WE HAVEN'T
CANCELED IN 25 YEARS,

19:56.029 --> 19:57.728
AND NOW SHE'S OUR NEW
EXECUTIVE PRODUCER,

19:57.764 --> 19:59.597
WHICH IS LIKE
STRIKING A MATCH

19:59.632 --> 20:01.332
IN A ROOM FULL OF GASOLINE,

20:01.367 --> 20:02.700
AND DO YOU KNOW
WHO RUDY HIRED

20:02.735 --> 20:04.402
TO BE MY NEW CO-HOST?

20:04.437 --> 20:06.938
A LITTLE FLY SPECK HE FOUND
ON SOME COMMUNITY TV STATION

20:06.973 --> 20:08.606
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.575
COMPLETE AMATEUR.
ZERO EXPERIENCE.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.910
I'M SURE HE HAD A REASON.

20:12.946 --> 20:13.945
DO NOT CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

20:13.980 --> 20:14.879
THE MINUTE SHE GOT HERE,

20:14.914 --> 20:16.180
SHE LOCKED HERSELF
IN HER DRESSING ROOM.

20:16.216 --> 20:17.048
SHE IS NOT COMING OUT,

20:17.083 --> 20:17.982
WHICH IS PERFECT,

20:18.017 --> 20:20.751
BECAUSE WE GO LIVE
IN 30 MINUTES, PEOPLE!

20:20.787 --> 20:23.421
DID ANYBODY TRY
TO TALK TO HER?

20:23.456 --> 20:24.589
MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN LISTENING

20:24.624 --> 20:25.923
TO WHAT I'VE
BEEN SAYING.

20:25.959 --> 20:28.960
THIS WHOLE SHOW IS
GOING UP IN FLAMES.

20:28.995 --> 20:31.095
POOF!

20:32.765 --> 20:34.465
TIFFANY?

20:34.500 --> 20:36.934
IT'S BILLIE BLESSINGS.

20:36.970 --> 20:38.135
I'D LOVE TO SAY HI.

20:38.171 --> 20:41.305
I'M SO GLAD
TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.917
I CAN'T GO OUT THERE.

20:52.952 --> 20:53.951
I TOLD RUDY

20:53.987 --> 20:56.053
I DON'T DO
LIVE TELEVISION.

20:56.089 --> 20:58.422
NO, MY STYLE SHOW
WAS PRERECORDED.

20:58.458 --> 20:59.924
WHAT IF I MAKE A MISTAKE?

20:59.959 --> 21:01.259
RUDY SAID
THAT HE'D HELP ME,

21:01.294 --> 21:03.060
BUT NOW HE'S GONE.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.629
HE KNEW YOU
COULD DO THIS.

21:04.664 --> 21:06.330
THAT'S WHY
HE HIRED YOU.

21:06.366 --> 21:07.798
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I GET STAGE FRIGHT.

21:07.834 --> 21:10.334
I FREEZE RIGHT UP.

21:10.370 --> 21:11.969
I FELT EXACTLY
THE SAME WAY

21:12.005 --> 21:13.838
WHEN I STARTED.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.239
YOU DID?

21:15.275 --> 21:17.308
I TOLD RUDY
I WOULD FAINT.

21:17.343 --> 21:18.409
KNOW WHAT HE SAID?

21:18.444 --> 21:19.810
"PEOPLE LOVE SURPRISES."

21:22.382 --> 21:23.814
HE GAVE ME
A GREAT TIP.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.683
HE TOLD ME

21:25.718 --> 21:27.918
IF SOMEONE ASKS YOU A QUESTION
YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER,

21:27.954 --> 21:29.487
REPEAT IT BACK.

21:29.522 --> 21:30.921
SO YOU HAVE TIME TO THINK.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.491
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.726
WHY DON'T I GO GET MAKEUP?

21:37.664 --> 21:38.763
RUDY SAID

21:38.798 --> 21:41.832
THAT YOU WERE THE NICEST PERSON
THAT HE'S EVER MET.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.434
HE WAS RIGHT.

21:43.469 --> 21:44.802
YOU CAN DO THIS.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.177
GRETCHEN, IT'S BILLIE.

22:15.401 --> 22:16.200
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

22:17.437 --> 22:19.203
GRETCHEN!

22:19.238 --> 22:20.504
ARE YOU OKAY?

22:22.408 --> 22:23.808
WHY ARE YOU IN HERE?

22:23.843 --> 22:25.810
I WAS JUST...

22:25.845 --> 22:26.844
I DON'T KNOW.

22:26.879 --> 22:27.745
I WAS JUST TRYING

22:27.780 --> 22:29.580
TO WRAP MY MIND
AROUND WHAT HAPPENED.

22:29.615 --> 22:30.915
DIDN'T YOU GET THE MESSAGE?

22:30.950 --> 22:33.417
I TOLD KIKI TO CALL YOU
LAST NIGHT.

22:33.453 --> 22:34.985
MY PHONE
WAS TURNED OFF.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.721
I'VE CANCELED
THE COOKING SEGMENT.

22:36.756 --> 22:38.255
CANCELED? WHY?

22:38.291 --> 22:39.857
I'M TAKING YOU OFF THE SHOW.

22:39.892 --> 22:41.425
YOU'RE FIRING ME?

22:41.461 --> 22:42.927
LOOK, I DON'T THINK
IT'S APPROPRIATE

22:42.962 --> 22:45.196
FOR YOU TO BE HERE,
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

22:45.231 --> 22:47.598
GRETCHEN,
RUDY DIED AT MY RESTAURANT,

22:47.633 --> 22:48.766
BUT I DIDN'T KILL HIM.

22:48.801 --> 22:50.401
DON'T MAKE ME PLAY
YOUR LITTLE GAMES.

22:50.436 --> 22:52.236
I HAVE ENOUGH
ON MY PLATE.

22:52.271 --> 22:53.337
IF YOU NEED
EXPLANATIONS,

22:53.373 --> 22:55.973
I SUGGEST
YOU TALK TO THE POLICE.

23:08.454 --> 23:10.354
YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM.

23:10.390 --> 23:12.022
THEY'LL THINK SHE DID IT.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.224
WELL THEN,
YOU NEED TO TELL BILLIE.

23:13.259 --> 23:14.725
I CAN'T.

23:14.761 --> 23:15.893
TELL BILLIE WHAT?

23:15.928 --> 23:17.395
UH...

23:17.430 --> 23:18.429
THE POLICE LEFT,

23:18.464 --> 23:20.564
AND THE KITCHEN IS CLEAN.

23:21.801 --> 23:24.635
TELL HER,
OR I'LL TELL HER MYSELF.

23:24.670 --> 23:26.404
EXCUSE ME.
CAN I COME IN?

23:26.439 --> 23:27.438
WELL, I HOPE
THIS MEANS

23:27.473 --> 23:28.806
WE CAN OPEN BACK UP.

23:28.841 --> 23:31.642
I NEED TO SPEAK TO MAURICE.

23:31.677 --> 23:33.210
MAURICE? WHY?

23:33.246 --> 23:34.645
THERE WAS A CAKE
AT RUDY'S APARTMENT

23:34.680 --> 23:36.113
THAT TESTED POSITIVE
FOR CYANIDE.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.784
IT COULDN'T HAVE
BEEN THE CAKE.

23:39.819 --> 23:41.152
RUDY DROVE
TO THE RESTAURANT.

23:41.187 --> 23:43.053
THAT WOULD TAKE
AT LEAST 40 MINUTES.

23:43.089 --> 23:45.423
CYANIDE KILLS PEOPLE
IN SECONDS.

23:45.458 --> 23:47.224
UNLESS IT'S BAKED.
IT COMBINES WITH THE SUGAR.

23:47.260 --> 23:48.926
IT CAN TAKE HOURS
TO BREAK DOWN.

23:48.961 --> 23:50.461
WHAT IS GOING
ON HERE?

23:50.496 --> 23:52.563
DID YOU DELIVER A CAKE
TO RUDY'S BUILDING YESTERDAY?

23:52.598 --> 23:54.064
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAY ANYTHING.

23:55.635 --> 23:57.134
I DID.

23:58.204 --> 23:59.503
WHAT?

23:59.539 --> 24:00.805
I'M PLACING YOU
UNDER ARREST

24:00.840 --> 24:01.705
FOR THE MURDER OF RUDY SLATER.

24:21.494 --> 24:23.327
THEY KNEW MY FATHER.

24:23.362 --> 24:24.428
I REMINDED THEM

24:24.464 --> 24:25.229
THAT YOU'RE ALLOWED
TO SEE VISITORS

24:25.264 --> 24:27.798
BEFORE THEY TAKE YOU
DOWN TO BOOKING.

24:27.834 --> 24:29.133
MAURICE...

24:29.168 --> 24:30.701
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

24:30.736 --> 24:32.470
WHY DID YOU TAKE THAT CAKE
TO RUDY?

24:32.505 --> 24:36.106
WHEN I CAME TO WORK YESTERDAY,
IT WAS ON THE COUNTER.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.509
I FIGURED YOU BAKED IT
THE NIGHT BEFORE,

24:38.544 --> 24:40.878
BECAUSE YOU WERE GOING
TO HAVE IT ON THE SHOW,

24:40.913 --> 24:43.113
AND THEN I GOT
A TEXT FROM YOU

24:43.149 --> 24:44.982
ASKING ME TO BRING IT
TO RUDY'S APARTMENT,

24:45.017 --> 24:46.383
SO I DID.

24:46.419 --> 24:48.519
I DIDN'T...
I DIDN'T SEND YOU A TEXT.

24:48.554 --> 24:49.887
IT WAS YOUR NUMBER.

24:49.922 --> 24:53.324
YOUR NAME POPPED
RIGHT UP ON MY SCREEN.

24:53.359 --> 24:54.558
I WAS WITH RUDY
ON THE SET.

24:54.594 --> 24:57.027
WHY WOULD I SEND A CAKE
TO HIS APARTMENT?

24:57.063 --> 24:58.329
HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

24:58.364 --> 24:59.563
WHY DIDN'T YOU CHECK?

24:59.599 --> 25:00.865
IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE
I NEEDED TO CHECK

25:00.900 --> 25:03.501
UNTIL RUDY GOT POISONED,

25:03.536 --> 25:05.569
THEN THE POLICE WERE THERE
AND I COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

25:05.605 --> 25:06.871
YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM.

25:06.906 --> 25:08.639
THERE'S MORE.

25:10.009 --> 25:11.876
WHEN I GOT BACK
TO THE RESTAURANT,

25:11.911 --> 25:15.579
I FOUND AN OLD CAN OF RAT POISON
UNDER THE SINK.

25:15.615 --> 25:16.714
CYANOCIDE.

25:16.749 --> 25:19.350
THE ONLY INGREDIENT
IS CYANIDE.

25:19.385 --> 25:20.918
MAURICE...

25:20.953 --> 25:22.753
I DIDN'T PUT IT TOGETHER.

25:22.788 --> 25:25.923
I FIGURED SOMEBODY FOUND IT
IN THE BASEMENT.

25:25.958 --> 25:29.760
NO ONE USES CYANIDE
FOR PEST CONTROL ANYMORE.

25:29.795 --> 25:32.663
YOU CAN'T EVEN BUY IT.

25:32.698 --> 25:35.266
I KNEW IT WAS DANGEROUS,

25:35.301 --> 25:36.901
SO I TOOK IT
AND PUT IT IN MY CAR.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.235
IN YOUR CAR?

25:38.271 --> 25:40.571
WELL, I COULDN'T THROW IT
IN THE DUMPSTER.

25:40.606 --> 25:42.106
THERE WAS ENOUGH CYANIDE
IN THAT CAN

25:42.141 --> 25:44.942
TO WIPE OUT HALF THE WEST COAST.

25:44.977 --> 25:47.211
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS,

25:47.246 --> 25:48.712
NOT AT FIRST.

25:50.616 --> 25:52.182
AFTER RUDY DIED, I HID IT.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.217
THAT'S EVIDENCE!

25:53.252 --> 25:54.251
THERE'S SOMEONE

25:54.287 --> 25:56.887
TRYING TO MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE YOU POISONED RUDY.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.255
IF I TOLD THE POLICE

25:58.291 --> 25:59.723
ABOUT THAT CYANIDE,

25:59.759 --> 26:02.560
YOU'D BE IN HERE, NOT ME,

26:02.595 --> 26:04.795
AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

26:04.830 --> 26:06.931
IF YOU DON'T TELL THEM,
AND THEY FIND IT,

26:06.966 --> 26:08.265
THEY'LL THINK YOU POISONED RUDY.

26:16.442 --> 26:17.741
CAN YOU GET FEATHERS?

26:17.777 --> 26:21.211
HE'S ALONE AT MY APARTMENT.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.213
OKAY.

26:35.227 --> 26:37.294
THEY'RE KEEPING HIM.

26:38.764 --> 26:40.064
THEY HAVE
SECURITY FOOTAGE

26:40.099 --> 26:42.032
OF HIM DELIVERING
THAT CAKE,

26:42.068 --> 26:43.734
AND THEY SAY HE'S A FLIGHT RISK.

26:43.769 --> 26:45.669
THE D.A. HAS TWO DAYS
TO PRESS CHARGES.

26:45.705 --> 26:47.671
I DON'T SEE HOW THEY CAN.
HE HAS NO MOTIVE.

26:47.707 --> 26:48.939
HE HAS A RECORD.

26:48.975 --> 26:50.674
WHAT?

26:50.710 --> 26:51.742
YEAH, MAURICE
HAS BEEN ARRESTED BEFORE.

26:55.715 --> 26:56.947
MAURICE WAS JUST
RUNNING THE STREETS

26:56.983 --> 26:58.182
WHEN YOUR FATHER MET HIM,

26:58.217 --> 26:59.617
AND HIS FAMILY?

26:59.652 --> 27:01.418
LIKE A BARREL OF SNAKES,

27:01.454 --> 27:02.286
AND YOUR FATHER TRIED
TO HELP HIM,

27:02.321 --> 27:04.555
BUT MAURICE KEPT GETTING
INTO TROUBLE.

27:04.590 --> 27:05.756
WHAT KIND OF TROUBLE?

27:05.791 --> 27:06.924
BREAK-INS, MOSTLY,

27:06.959 --> 27:09.293
AND THAT'S HOW HE ENDED UP
IN PRISON,

27:09.328 --> 27:10.461
BUT THAT'S WHEN HE LEARNED
HOW TO COOK,

27:10.496 --> 27:13.697
'CAUSE YOUR FATHER CONVINCED HIM
TO GO INTO THE PROGRAM.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.467
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

27:16.502 --> 27:18.068
BECAUSE IT WAS NOT MY PLACE
TO TELL YOU,

27:18.104 --> 27:19.637
AND BESIDES,
YOUR FATHER SAID

27:19.672 --> 27:21.939
DON'T JUDGE HIM
BY HIS MISTAKES.

27:21.974 --> 27:25.242
WHAT MATTERS IS
HOW HE'S CHANGED.

27:30.850 --> 27:31.782
HOW ARE WE GOING
TO GET THROUGH THIS?

27:33.653 --> 27:35.753
OH, MY GOSH.

27:37.423 --> 27:38.622
EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME.
HEY, HEY, HEY.

27:38.658 --> 27:40.057
STAY WITH ME.
COME ON.

27:41.494 --> 27:42.993
'SCUSE US!
'SCUSE US.

27:43.029 --> 27:43.794
COMING THROUGH.
COMING THROUGH.

27:43.829 --> 27:45.596
COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON.

27:45.631 --> 27:47.164
HEY, OUT OF THE WAY!
OUT OF THE WAY.

27:47.199 --> 27:48.565
COMING...
COMING THROUGH.

27:48.601 --> 27:50.467
HERE WE GO, HERE WE GO.
OUT OF THE WAY.

27:56.475 --> 27:57.474
OH, MAN,

27:57.510 --> 27:58.776
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THAT.

27:58.811 --> 27:59.777
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

27:59.812 --> 28:00.811
ACTUALLY,
IT KIND OF IS.

28:00.846 --> 28:02.146
I KNEW
IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

28:02.181 --> 28:03.013
I SHOULD HAVE WARNED YOU,

28:03.049 --> 28:04.481
BUT GRETCHEN SAID
I'D GET BETTER FOOTAGE

28:04.517 --> 28:05.983
IF I CAUGHT YOU
BY SURPRISE.

28:06.018 --> 28:08.252
WHY DON'T I MAKE
SOME COFFEE?

28:08.287 --> 28:09.420
CHAPTER FIVE...

28:09.455 --> 28:12.756
"EVERY CONVERSATION
IS IMPROVED BY PIE."

28:12.792 --> 28:14.291
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?

28:14.326 --> 28:16.160
GRETCHEN TOLD EVERYONE
MAURICE WAS ARRESTED.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.061
AND KIKI CALLED ME,

28:17.096 --> 28:18.829
AND WE COULDN'T LEAVE
YOU BY YOURSELF.

28:21.734 --> 28:23.667
WHY WOULD MAURICE KILL RUDY?

28:23.703 --> 28:24.401
MAURICE DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY.

28:24.437 --> 28:25.803
MAURICE CAN'T EVEN
KILL A SPIDER.

28:25.838 --> 28:28.605
HE TAKES THEM OUTSIDE.

28:28.641 --> 28:30.507
GRETCHEN SAID THE POLICE
HAVE SECURITY FOOTAGE OF HIM

28:30.543 --> 28:31.341
DELIVERING THE CAKE.

28:31.377 --> 28:32.876
'CAUSE HE GOT A TEXT
FROM MY PHONE,

28:32.912 --> 28:34.845
TELLING HIM TO DELIVER IT THERE.

28:34.880 --> 28:35.713
YOU TOLD HIM TO DO IT?

28:35.748 --> 28:38.482
SOMEBODY ELSE
MUST HAVE USED MY PHONE.

28:38.517 --> 28:39.817
HERE,
HAVE SOME COFFEE.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.251
IT'LL HELP YOU THINK.

28:42.555 --> 28:43.454
WE SHOULD BE
SYSTEMATIC.

28:45.024 --> 28:46.223
I MADE A SPREADSHEET.

28:46.258 --> 28:47.357
EVERYONE FROM
THE RESTAURANT

28:47.393 --> 28:48.559
AND THE TV STUDIO

28:48.594 --> 28:49.426
AND THEIR CONNECTION
TO RUDY.

28:49.462 --> 28:51.428
COMPUTER GEEK
TO THE RESCUE.

28:52.698 --> 28:54.865
LOOK, I KNOW
SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE HIM,

28:54.900 --> 28:57.468
BUT HE CHANGED MY LIFE.

28:57.503 --> 28:58.502
HE GAVE THE COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS

28:58.537 --> 29:00.204
AT MY COLLEGE,

29:00.239 --> 29:02.005
AND WHEN I TOLD HIM THAT
I WANTED TO WORK IN TELEVISION,

29:02.041 --> 29:03.073
HE HIRED ME,

29:03.109 --> 29:04.808
A FARM GIRL
WITH NO EXPERIENCE.

29:04.844 --> 29:06.910
WELL, OKAY, FARM GIRL.
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

29:06.946 --> 29:08.145
OKAY.

29:08.180 --> 29:09.146
ALL OF THE
CONTACT NUMBERS

29:09.181 --> 29:10.347
ARE ON THE RIGHT.

29:10.382 --> 29:11.315
I'VE STARRED
THE PEOPLE

29:11.350 --> 29:12.349
WITH THE
STRONGEST MOTIVES.

29:12.384 --> 29:13.584
IT'S NOTHING
PERSONAL.

29:13.619 --> 29:14.818
I JUST TRIED
TO BE OBJECTIVE.

29:14.854 --> 29:15.819
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

29:15.855 --> 29:17.221
WHY DO I
HAVE A STAR?

29:17.256 --> 29:18.155
YOU KNOW HOW RUDY SAID

29:18.190 --> 29:20.424
SOMEONE WAS TRYING
TO SABOTAGE THE SHOW?

29:20.459 --> 29:22.092
LAST WEEK,

29:22.128 --> 29:24.161
SOMEONE EMAILED
LANIE'S OLD CONTRACT TO LANCE.

29:25.731 --> 29:27.998
BEFORE SHE DIED,
SHE WAS MAKING TWICE HIS SALARY.

29:28.033 --> 29:29.700
OUCH.

29:29.735 --> 29:33.704
SO LANCE DEMANDED A RAISE
TWICE THE AMOUNT.

29:33.739 --> 29:34.772
IT WASN'T IN THE BUDGET,

29:34.807 --> 29:37.207
SO RUDY MADE A LIST OF EVERYONE
HE COULD CUT...

29:37.243 --> 29:40.444
LANCE, BILLIE, OR PHIL.

29:40.479 --> 29:41.712
HE WANTED TO FIRE ME?

29:41.747 --> 29:42.913
YOU'RE THE HIGHEST-PAID
CAMERA OPERATOR

29:42.948 --> 29:44.014
ON THE SHOW.

29:45.618 --> 29:46.683
DID RUDY CALL YOU
YESTERDAY?

29:46.719 --> 29:48.685
BECAUSE I SAW A NOTE
IN HIS OFFICE.

29:48.721 --> 29:51.188
YEAH, BUT HE DIDN'T FIRE ME,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

29:51.223 --> 29:53.357
HE WANTED THE PASSWORD
TO THE FILM ARCHIVES

29:53.392 --> 29:54.858
SO HE COULD WATCH
AUDITION FOOTAGE.

29:54.894 --> 29:56.727
IT WAS JUST AFTER
THAT BIG FIGHT.

29:56.762 --> 29:58.495
I ASSUMED HE WAS LOOKING
FOR A DIFFERENT CO-HOST.

29:59.899 --> 30:02.566
MAYBE WE SHOULD GIVE TIFFANY
A STAR, TOO.

30:02.601 --> 30:03.400
I MEAN, IF SHE WAS AFRAID

30:03.435 --> 30:04.802
HE WAS GOING
TO CHANGE HIS MIND...

30:04.837 --> 30:06.436
I THINK
WE SHOULD GIVE THIS LIST

30:06.472 --> 30:07.805
TO THE POLICE.

30:07.840 --> 30:09.573
I AGREE
WITH AUNT CASSANDRA.

30:09.608 --> 30:10.707
WHOA, MAYBE YOU DIDN'T SEE...

30:10.743 --> 30:12.609
THERE'S A STAR BESIDE YOUR NAME.

30:12.645 --> 30:13.811
YOU DON'T WANT TO INVESTIGATE?

30:13.846 --> 30:15.546
NO.

30:15.581 --> 30:16.780
NO...

30:22.955 --> 30:24.555
IF WE'RE NOT INVESTIGATING,

30:24.590 --> 30:27.224
HOW COME YOU IN HERE,
LOOKING LIKE NANCY DREW?

30:27.259 --> 30:29.259
YOU SAW THAT LIST.

30:29.295 --> 30:30.727
MAURICE IS THE BEST SUSPECT,

30:30.763 --> 30:32.462
AND I NEED TO PROVE
THAT HE DIDN'T DO IT.

30:32.498 --> 30:33.797
OH, IS THAT
JUST A FEELING?

30:33.833 --> 30:35.599
HOW YOU GOING TO PROVE IT?

30:35.634 --> 30:37.568
WELL, I THOUGHT I'D START
AT RUDY'S APARTMENT,

30:37.603 --> 30:39.937
SEE IF HE HAD
ANY OTHER VISITORS YESTERDAY.

30:39.972 --> 30:40.838
YOU KNOW, THIS MIGHT SEEM

30:40.873 --> 30:42.272
A LITTLE OBVIOUS
TO POINT OUT RIGHT NOW,

30:42.308 --> 30:44.508
BUT YOUR FATHER
WAS THE POLICE OFFICER,

30:44.543 --> 30:45.576
NOT YOU.

30:45.611 --> 30:47.344
MAURICE IS FAMILY.

30:47.379 --> 30:48.979
I AM NOT ABOUT
TO LET HIM GO TO JAIL

30:49.014 --> 30:50.247
FOR A CRIME HE DIDN'T COMMIT.

31:00.459 --> 31:01.425
I KNEW IT WAS YOU.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.260
IT'S ME.

31:03.295 --> 31:05.095
BILLIE BLESSINGS.

31:05.130 --> 31:06.864
MY WIFE WATCHES YOU
EVERY MORNING.

31:06.899 --> 31:09.399
CAN I GET AN AUTOGRAPH?

31:11.203 --> 31:12.703
"POOKIE," HUH?

31:12.738 --> 31:14.004
YEAH, IT'S A PET NAME.

31:15.708 --> 31:17.140
SHE USED TO BE TERRIFIED
TO COOK,

31:17.176 --> 31:19.042
BUT YOU GAVE HER
CONFIDENCE,

31:19.078 --> 31:19.943
CHANGED HER WHOLE LIFE.

31:19.979 --> 31:21.178
AW...

31:21.213 --> 31:22.145
AND WHAT'S
YOUR NAME?

31:22.181 --> 31:24.014
OH, ZACH.

31:24.049 --> 31:26.617
I GUESS YOU'RE HERE
ABOUT MR. SLATER.

31:26.652 --> 31:29.453
LOOK, I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED,

31:29.488 --> 31:31.154
BUT I'M AFRAID I CAN'T LET YOU
INTO THE APARTMENT.

31:31.190 --> 31:32.122
ACTUALLY, I WAS WONDERING

31:32.157 --> 31:33.690
IF ANYONE ELSE CAME TO SEE RUDY
YESTERDAY,

31:33.726 --> 31:35.158
BESIDES THE MAN
WHO BROUGHT THE CAKE.

31:35.194 --> 31:37.294
NO, NOT THAT I SAW, NO,

31:37.329 --> 31:40.030
BUT THE POLICE TOOK A COPY
OF THE SECURITY FOOTAGE.

31:40.065 --> 31:41.131
MAYBE
THEY'LL FIND SOMETHING.

31:41.166 --> 31:42.332
COPY?

31:42.368 --> 31:43.634
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU HAVE THE FOOTAGE?

31:43.669 --> 31:46.003
OH...

31:46.038 --> 31:47.170
I DON'T THINK I'M ALLOWED

31:47.206 --> 31:49.306
TO SHOW ANYBODY
BESIDES MANAGEMENT.

31:49.341 --> 31:52.109
NOT EVEN
FOR A FRIEND OF YOUR WIFE?

31:55.681 --> 31:57.714
SO IT RUNS 24-7.

31:57.750 --> 31:58.916
WE RECORD IT
TO THIS COMPUTER,

31:58.951 --> 32:00.150
AND THEN BACK IT UP
TO A SERVER OFF-SITE

32:00.185 --> 32:02.653
EVERY NIGHT.

32:02.688 --> 32:05.255
THAT'S MAURICE.

32:05.291 --> 32:07.357
THAT WAS
YESTERDAY MORNING,

32:07.393 --> 32:09.059
ABOUT 9:00...

32:09.094 --> 32:10.861
THE USUAL RESIDENTS
COMING AND GOING,

32:10.896 --> 32:13.563
AND THEN MR. SLATER
CAME HOME AT 3:00.

32:19.305 --> 32:21.104
THAT'S IT.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.005
NOBODY ELSE CAME IN

32:22.041 --> 32:25.175
UNTIL HE LEFT
ABOUT FOUR HOURS LATER.

32:25.210 --> 32:27.511
WAIT.
CAN YOU GO BACK?

32:27.546 --> 32:28.478
SURE.

32:29.748 --> 32:30.747
OKAY, STOP.

32:30.783 --> 32:31.848
RIGHT THERE.

32:31.884 --> 32:33.583
WHO IS THAT?

32:33.619 --> 32:35.852
MISS DIVOSS.
HIS FIANCEE.

32:37.389 --> 32:38.322
SHE DIDN'T COME IN,
AND I DIDN'T WAVE,

32:38.357 --> 32:41.091
'CAUSE I...
WELL, I'M TRYING TO BE DISCREET.

32:41.126 --> 32:42.359
SHE WAS JUST STANDING THERE?

32:43.729 --> 32:45.095
LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO GET ANYONE IN TROUBLE.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.764
OF COURSE NOT.

32:47.800 --> 32:50.300
OKAY, BETWEEN YOU AND ME?

32:50.336 --> 32:52.235
MR. SLATER WAS KIND
OF A LADIES' MAN,

32:52.271 --> 32:54.571
ONE GIRLFRIEND
AFTER ANOTHER.

32:54.606 --> 32:57.207
HE WAS SEEING SOMEBODY
BEFORE MISS DIVOSS.

32:57.242 --> 32:59.609
AND SHE USED TO HANG AROUND
THE SAME WAY, ALL MOONY,

32:59.645 --> 33:01.311
JUST WATCHING THE BUILDING

33:01.347 --> 33:03.413
LIKE, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE HE'D CHANGE HIS MIND,

33:03.449 --> 33:05.282
BUT HE WAS A PLAYER.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.117
MAY HE REST IN PEACE.

33:07.152 --> 33:10.220
NO, ONCE HE MOVED ON,
IT WAS OVER.

33:10.255 --> 33:11.888
YOU THINK THAT'S WHY
GRETCHEN DIDN'T COME INSIDE?

33:11.924 --> 33:13.757
BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT MR. SLATER
HAD MOVED ON?

33:13.792 --> 33:15.993
WELL, I CAN'T SAY FOR SURE,

33:16.028 --> 33:17.294
BUT I DID SEE HIM
WITH A BRUNETTE A FEW TIMES.

33:17.329 --> 33:18.362
REAL STUNNER.

33:22.935 --> 33:24.568
PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS.

33:26.038 --> 33:27.337
ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME?

33:27.373 --> 33:28.638
I WASN'T PLANNING TO.

33:28.674 --> 33:29.673
I CAME BY
THE RESTAURANT

33:29.708 --> 33:31.641
JUST AS YOU WERE LEAVING.

33:31.677 --> 33:34.244
YOU HAD SUCH AN
INTENSE EXPRESSION,

33:34.279 --> 33:35.746
I DECIDED TO SEE
WHERE IT'D TAKE US.

33:35.781 --> 33:37.748
WHY WERE YOU
AT THE RESTAURANT?

33:37.783 --> 33:39.249
OH, I HEARD YOU
FINAGLED YOUR WAY

33:39.284 --> 33:40.584
INTO SEEING
MAURICE TERREBONE.

33:40.619 --> 33:42.019
FINAGLE? NO.

33:42.054 --> 33:43.787
VISITS ARE PERMITTED.

33:43.822 --> 33:45.689
WELL, MOST OFFICERS
WON'T ALLOW IT,

33:45.724 --> 33:47.657
AND RUDY'S DOORMAN
DEFINITELY WASN'T ALLOWED

33:47.693 --> 33:49.960
TO SHOW YOU THAT
SECURITY FOOTAGE.

33:51.997 --> 33:53.530
INTERFERING WITH
A POLICE INVESTIGATION

33:53.565 --> 33:54.831
IS A CRIME,

33:54.867 --> 33:56.466
BUT IF YOU WANT
TO HELP MAURICE,

33:56.502 --> 33:57.968
THIS ISN'T THE
WAY TO DO IT.

33:58.003 --> 33:59.469
IAN, YOU MUST HAVE SEEN
GRETCHEN DIVOSS

33:59.505 --> 34:00.804
ON THAT SECURITY FOOTAGE.

34:00.839 --> 34:02.005
WHY WAS SHE THERE?

34:02.041 --> 34:03.507
I CAN'T TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THE CASE.

34:03.542 --> 34:04.674
AND YESTERDAY,

34:04.710 --> 34:06.276
GRETCHEN AND RUDY
GOT INTO A BIG FIGHT,

34:06.311 --> 34:09.846
AND GRETCHEN TOLD RUDY
SHE'D BREAK HIM.

34:09.882 --> 34:10.847
DID YOUR FATHER
EVER TELL YOU

34:10.882 --> 34:12.815
ABOUT OCCAM'S RAZOR?

34:12.851 --> 34:15.518
THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATION
IS USUALLY THE BEST.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.853
MAYBE SHE CAME
BY RUDY'S APARTMENT

34:17.889 --> 34:19.822
TO APOLOGIZE.

34:19.858 --> 34:21.792
IS THAT
WHAT SHE TOLD YOU?

34:21.827 --> 34:23.693
LOOK, MAURICE
GAVE RUDY THE CAKE,

34:23.728 --> 34:25.027
NOT GRETCHEN.

34:25.063 --> 34:29.632
IAN, MAURICE
DOESN'T HAVE A MOTIVE.

34:29.668 --> 34:32.002
HE DIDN'T LIKE RUDY'S
INFLUENCE OVER YOU.

34:32.036 --> 34:32.902
HE WAS AFRAID

34:32.938 --> 34:34.670
YOU WERE GETTING
SWEPT UP IN THAT SHOW.

34:34.706 --> 34:35.739
OKAY, ACCORDING

34:35.774 --> 34:37.373
TO EVERYONE
I'VE SPOKEN TO,

34:37.409 --> 34:38.875
THAT RESTAURANT
IS HIS WHOLE LIFE.

34:38.911 --> 34:40.577
HE HAS NOTHING ELSE.

34:40.612 --> 34:43.146
SO THE PROSPECT
OF LOSING THAT,

34:43.181 --> 34:45.181
I BET IT MADE HIM
FEEL PRETTY DESPERATE.

34:45.217 --> 34:47.217
NOT ENOUGH
TO KILL SOMEONE.

34:47.252 --> 34:48.652
HE'S MADE BAD
DECISIONS BEFORE.

34:48.687 --> 34:50.187
LOOK, MAURICE
TOOK THAT CAKE TO RUDY

34:50.222 --> 34:51.721
BECAUSE HE GOT
A TEXT FROM ME

34:51.757 --> 34:52.922
TELLING HIM
TO TAKE IT...

34:52.958 --> 34:55.125
ONLY I DIDN'T SEND
HIM THE TEXT.

34:56.628 --> 34:57.861
LOOK, I KNOW
WE HAVE HISTORY,

34:57.896 --> 34:59.596
BUT I CAN'T TAKE
YOUR PHONE.

34:59.631 --> 35:00.997
LOOK, TAKE IT.
LOOK THROUGH IT.

35:01.033 --> 35:03.166
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
LOOK, TAKE IT.

35:03.202 --> 35:05.335
YOU WON'T FIND ANYTHING.

35:13.212 --> 35:15.545
HEY, FEATHERS!

35:15.581 --> 35:16.746
HI.

35:16.782 --> 35:18.181
DO YOU WANT TO GO
FOR A SLEEPOVER?

35:18.217 --> 35:19.516
COME ON.
LET'S GO.

35:19.551 --> 35:20.617
LET'S GET LEASHED UP.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.519
COME ON.
COME ON, BUDDY. COME ON.

35:22.554 --> 35:24.187
OH, YEAH, WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE SO MUCH FUN.

35:24.223 --> 35:26.056
YES, WE ARE.

35:26.091 --> 35:28.692
LET ME GRAB
ALL YOUR STUFF.

35:28.727 --> 35:30.894
ALL RIGHT.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

35:30.929 --> 35:32.462
WHERE'RE YOU GOING, BUDDY?
WHAT'S OVER THERE?

35:32.498 --> 35:35.699
YOU WANT A TREAT?
OKAY, I'LL GET YOU A TREAT.

35:35.734 --> 35:36.733
I'LL GET YOU A TREAT.

35:36.768 --> 35:39.035
OH!

35:39.071 --> 35:40.737
OH, MY GOODNESS.

35:40.772 --> 35:42.706
OH, MY GOODNESS.

35:42.741 --> 35:44.207
LET ME THINK. OKAY.

35:44.243 --> 35:45.675
OKAY.

35:48.013 --> 35:49.646
ALL RIGHT.

35:49.681 --> 35:51.481
OKAY, WHAT DO I DO?
WHAT DO I DO?

35:53.252 --> 35:54.384
ALL RIGHT, UH...

35:54.419 --> 35:57.087
OH, BOY.

35:57.122 --> 35:58.722
OH...

36:01.493 --> 36:03.326
HEY, DON'T LOOK AT ME
LIKE THAT.

36:03.362 --> 36:04.327
YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING
TO COME OVER HERE

36:04.363 --> 36:05.162
AND SEARCH THIS PLACE.

36:05.197 --> 36:06.463
YOU WANT YOUR DADDY
TO GO TO PRISON?

36:11.436 --> 36:13.570
OH, BOY.
OKAY, LET'S GO, FEATHERS.

36:17.176 --> 36:19.342
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, LITTLE GUY.

36:19.378 --> 36:21.745
OKAY.

36:21.780 --> 36:23.780
OKAY, COME HERE.

36:23.815 --> 36:25.415
ALL RIGHT.

36:26.818 --> 36:28.251
OKAY,
LET ME LET YOU LOOSE.

36:28.287 --> 36:29.286
HANG ON, HANG ON.

36:29.321 --> 36:30.453
OKAY, GO.

36:42.334 --> 36:43.466
IT'S OKAY, BUDDY.

36:43.502 --> 36:45.302
IT'S NOTHING.

37:06.858 --> 37:07.757
YOU RECOGNIZE THIS?

37:08.760 --> 37:10.694
NO.

37:10.729 --> 37:11.628
YOU SURE THE
DOOR WAS LOCKED?

37:13.332 --> 37:15.665
WE DIDN'T FIND ANY
SIGN OF FORCED ENTRY.

37:15.701 --> 37:18.301
BECAUSE WHOEVER DID THIS
MUST HAVE A KEY,

37:18.337 --> 37:21.004
LIKE THEY HAVE A KEY
TO THE RESTAURANT,

37:21.039 --> 37:22.072
WHICH IS HOW THEY GOT
THE CAKE

37:22.107 --> 37:23.907
INTO THE RESTAURANT KITCHEN.

37:23.942 --> 37:26.209
YEAH, UNLESS
THE PERSON WHO DID THIS

37:26.245 --> 37:27.510
ISN'T RUDY'S KILLER.

37:27.546 --> 37:30.013
OCCAM'S RAZOR.

37:30.048 --> 37:32.048
THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATION
IS USUALLY THE BEST.

37:34.019 --> 37:34.918
MAURICE COULDN'T
HAVE DONE THIS,

37:34.953 --> 37:37.220
BECAUSE HE'S IN JAIL.

37:37.256 --> 37:38.755
MAYBE THEY SAW ME
AT RUDY'S BUILDING.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.523
OR THEY SAW YOU
DOING SOMETHING ELSE

37:40.559 --> 37:43.226
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

37:43.262 --> 37:46.396
WELL, YOU WERE FOLLOWING ME,
SO YOU KNOW EVERYTHING.

38:06.952 --> 38:08.218
IT'S JUST TEMPORARY.

38:09.554 --> 38:11.021
<i>SO, TIFFANY,</i>

38:11.056 --> 38:12.589
<i>THIS IS YOUR
SECOND DAY WITH US.</i>

38:12.624 --> 38:15.592
<i>HOW DO YOU
LIKE US SO FAR?</i>

38:15.627 --> 38:18.094
<i>HOW DO YOU LIKE HAVING ME?</i>

38:18.130 --> 38:20.030
<i>OH, BOY. LOOKS LIKE
SHE'S GOING TO MAKE ME SAY IT.</i>

38:22.334 --> 38:25.802
<i>I FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE BEEN
PART OF OUR FAMILY FOREVER.</i>

38:25.837 --> 38:27.637
<i>AM I RIGHT, VIEWERS?</i>

38:27.673 --> 38:28.938
WHY ARE YOU NOT
AT THE STUDIO?

38:28.974 --> 38:29.906
I CALLED IN SICK.

38:29.941 --> 38:31.141
I CAN'T TAKE
ANOTHER DAY

38:31.176 --> 38:32.475
AS GRETCHEN'S
ASSISTANT.

38:32.511 --> 38:33.877
<i>LOSING OUR EXECUTIVE PRODUCER</i>

38:33.912 --> 38:36.313
<i>THE NIGHT BEFORE YOU STARTED...</i>

38:36.348 --> 38:37.781
<i>THAT WAS A SHOCK.</i>

38:37.816 --> 38:38.548
<i>IT WAS A SHOCK.</i>

38:38.583 --> 38:40.583
I THINK LANCE HAS
A CRUSH ON HER.

38:40.619 --> 38:42.619
HE'S FOLLOWING HER AROUND
LIKE A BABY DUCK.

38:42.654 --> 38:43.653
<i>BUT I UNDERSTAND</i>

38:43.689 --> 38:46.289
<i>THE POLICE ALREADY HAVE SOMEONE
IN CUSTODY.</i>

38:46.325 --> 38:48.224
THIS MAY SOUND CRAZY, BUT...

38:48.260 --> 38:49.726
DO YOU THINK RUDY
WAS SEEING HER?

38:52.130 --> 38:54.731
I GUESS YOU DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THE PICTURES.

38:54.766 --> 38:56.299
THESE WERE POSTED

38:56.335 --> 38:57.600
TWO DAYS
BEFORE RUDY DIED.

38:57.636 --> 38:59.069
I THINK

38:59.104 --> 39:00.270
IT'S WHAT HE AND GRETCHEN
WERE FIGHTING ABOUT.

39:01.973 --> 39:03.406
WHO WOULD TAKE THESE?

39:03.442 --> 39:04.507
RUDY THOUGHT

39:04.543 --> 39:05.742
GRETCHEN HIRED
A PRIVATE DETECTIVE

39:05.777 --> 39:07.344
BECAUSE SHE WAS JEALOUS,

39:07.379 --> 39:08.244
AND SOMEONE LEAKED
THESE PICTURES

39:08.280 --> 39:09.813
TO THIS WEBSITE.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.915
WHAT IF GRETCHEN
LEAKED THE PICTURES?

39:13.118 --> 39:14.484
GRETCHEN?

39:14.519 --> 39:15.685
WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?

39:15.721 --> 39:18.088
SHE TOLD RUDY
SHE'D DESTROY THE SHOW.

39:19.791 --> 39:21.524
THAT'S PRETTY CRAZY,
EVEN FOR GRETCHEN.

39:21.560 --> 39:24.461
GRETCHEN WAS AT RUDY'S
APARTMENT BUILDING

39:24.496 --> 39:25.829
THE DAY HE DIED.

39:28.567 --> 39:29.599
ARE YOU SAYING
GRETCHEN KILLED HIM?

39:31.837 --> 39:32.702
I THINK
I NEED TO PAY TIFFANY A VISIT,

39:32.738 --> 39:35.305
AND FIND OUT
WHY GRETCHEN WAS SO UPSET.

39:38.577 --> 39:39.342
BILLIE!

39:40.812 --> 39:42.145
I WAS STRESS SHOPPING.

39:42.180 --> 39:43.079
IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN
YOU WERE HERE,

39:43.115 --> 39:44.614
I WOULD HAVE COME
STRAIGHT FROM THE STUDIO.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.319
OH, I GUESS MY SECRET'S OUT.

39:49.354 --> 39:51.054
I'M YOUR BIGGEST FAN.

39:51.089 --> 39:51.888
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE

39:51.923 --> 39:53.089
YOU'RE HERE
IN MY LITTLE KITCHEN.

39:54.860 --> 39:56.526
I WATCHED YOU ON
THE SHOW THIS MORNING.

39:56.561 --> 39:58.628
YOU DID A GREAT JOB.

39:58.663 --> 40:01.698
THAT IS JUST BECAUSE
YOU TALKED ME OFF THAT LEDGE.

40:04.102 --> 40:05.802
HOW DID...

40:05.837 --> 40:07.704
HOW DID RUDY FIND YOU, ANYWAY?

40:07.739 --> 40:09.906
I HAD A STYLE SHOW.

40:09.941 --> 40:11.875
I WAS COMMUNITY TV.

40:11.910 --> 40:14.177
NOBODY EVER SAW IT,

40:14.212 --> 40:15.812
BUT RUDY SHOWED UP ONE DAY

40:15.847 --> 40:18.848
AND TOLD ME
THAT HE WOULD MAKE ME A STAR.

40:18.884 --> 40:20.650
JUST BETWEEN
YOU AND ME,

40:20.685 --> 40:23.920
I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHY HE DID THAT.

40:23.955 --> 40:27.257
DO YOU THINK
THAT RUDY COULD HAVE BEEN...

40:27.292 --> 40:30.560
MAYBE JUST
A LITTLE BIT IN LOVE WITH YOU?

40:31.696 --> 40:32.362
YOU SAW THE PICTURES.

40:34.099 --> 40:36.566
I WAS AFRAID THAT WOULD HAPPEN.

40:36.601 --> 40:37.500
YOU MUST THINK
I'M A TERRIBLE PERSON.

40:37.536 --> 40:39.169
NO! NO.

40:39.204 --> 40:41.337
OUR RELATIONSHIP
WAS STRICTLY PROFESSIONAL.

40:41.373 --> 40:43.740
THAT'S WHY THOSE PICTURES
WERE SO UPSETTING.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.675
GRETCHEN CALLED ME

40:45.710 --> 40:48.044
AS SOON AS SHE SAW THEM.

40:48.079 --> 40:50.180
SHE SAID THAT I DIDN'T KNOW
WHO I WAS DEALING WITH.

40:50.215 --> 40:52.682
MM.
SOUNDS LIKE GRETCHEN.

40:52.717 --> 40:55.018
RUDY SAID
THAT SHE COULD BE A BIT JEALOUS,

40:55.053 --> 40:57.387
AND RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING,
HE DIDN'T WANT ME ON SET.

40:57.422 --> 40:59.289
WE HAD TO MEET
IN COFFEE SHOPS.

40:59.324 --> 41:00.290
HE EVEN SNUCK ME
INTO HIS APARTMENT

41:00.325 --> 41:02.392
THROUGH THE SERVICE ENTRANCE.

41:02.427 --> 41:03.626
YOU WENT TO HIS APARTMENT?

41:03.662 --> 41:05.261
OH, NO, NOT LIKE THAT.

41:05.297 --> 41:06.863
JUST TO SIGN THE CONTRACTS.

41:06.898 --> 41:08.965
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN THERE
THE DAY RUDY GOT THE CAKE.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.734
I WAS THERE
FOR FIVE MINUTES,

41:11.770 --> 41:13.269
AND I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

41:13.305 --> 41:15.772
I SIGNED THE CONTRACTS
AND I LEFT.

41:15.807 --> 41:17.474
PLEASE DON'T TELL
THE POLICE.

41:17.509 --> 41:18.641
WAIT...

41:18.677 --> 41:20.577
IT WASN'T
JUST FOR THE PICTURES.

41:20.612 --> 41:22.045
AS SOON AS I MET RUDY,

41:22.080 --> 41:23.613
I STARTED GETTING
THESE PHONE CALLS

41:23.648 --> 41:25.482
FROM THIS UNLISTED NUMBER.

41:25.517 --> 41:28.585
THEY WOULD BREATHE
AND THEN THEY WOULD HANG UP.

41:28.620 --> 41:30.587
I FOUND A MESSAGE ON MY CAR
IN LIPSTICK.

41:30.622 --> 41:32.655
"CO-HOST," CROSSED OUT
WITH A BIG X.

41:32.691 --> 41:35.291
RUDY THOUGHT IT WAS
SOMEBODY FROM THE SHOW,

41:35.327 --> 41:36.860
AND HE SAID
THEY WERE UNSTABLE...

41:38.363 --> 41:39.929
BUT THE DAY
THAT RUDY DIED...

41:41.333 --> 41:43.299
HE TOLD ME
HE KNEW WHO WAS DOING IT.

41:43.335 --> 41:44.734
HE HAD PROOF.

41:44.769 --> 41:46.569
HE WAS PLANNING
ON TAKING IT TO THE POLICE.

41:46.605 --> 41:47.604
TIFFANY!

41:47.639 --> 41:48.938
YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM.

41:48.974 --> 41:50.306
I CAN'T.

41:50.342 --> 41:52.609
I MEAN,
DON'T YOU SEE?

41:52.644 --> 41:56.112
SOMEONE KILLED RUDY.

41:56.147 --> 41:58.081
IF THEY THINK
THAT I KNOW SOMETHING,

41:58.116 --> 41:59.916
THEY'LL KILL ME, TOO.

42:05.690 --> 42:06.789
HEY.

42:06.825 --> 42:07.757
OH, THANK GOODNESS.

42:07.792 --> 42:08.858
WHAT'S GOING ON?

42:08.894 --> 42:09.792
THE POLICE SAID
WE COULD RE-OPEN.

42:09.828 --> 42:10.627
CASSANDRA SAID

42:10.662 --> 42:12.328
IF YOU DIDN'T GET HERE
IN FIVE MINUTES,

42:12.364 --> 42:13.463
SHE WAS GOING
TO MAKE ME A SOUS-CHEF.

42:13.498 --> 42:14.597
WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?

42:14.633 --> 42:16.165
I HAVE BEEN CALLING YOU ALL DAY.

42:16.201 --> 42:17.534
I DON'T HAVE MY PHONE.

42:17.569 --> 42:18.635
OH, HONESTLY!

42:18.670 --> 42:19.502
YOU WOULD LOSE
YOUR HEAD

42:19.538 --> 42:20.703
IF IT WASN'T ATTACHED
TO YOUR NECK.

42:20.739 --> 42:21.938
WE HAVE 40 RESERVATIONS,

42:21.973 --> 42:23.172
AND A WAIT LIST,

42:23.208 --> 42:24.874
AND WE OPEN
IN A HALF HOUR.

42:24.910 --> 42:26.543
LISTEN UP,
PEOPLE!

42:26.578 --> 42:28.778
I WANT YOUR BEST
EFFORTS TONIGHT.

42:28.813 --> 42:30.880
WE NEED TO RE-OPEN
WITH CONFIDENCE,

42:30.916 --> 42:32.982
SO THAT OUR CUSTOMERS
CAN RETURN

42:33.018 --> 42:35.518
TO THE PLACE THAT THEY
HAVE LOVED AND TRUSTED

42:35.554 --> 42:36.819
FOR THE LAST
12 YEARS.

42:36.855 --> 42:39.188
LET'S GO.

42:39.224 --> 42:40.323
CAN YOU TAKE OVER,
PLEASE?

42:40.358 --> 42:42.325
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING.

42:42.360 --> 42:43.693
I...

42:54.506 --> 42:57.507
I THINK WE SHOULD SEND
THE STAFF HOME.

42:57.542 --> 42:59.208
I MEAN, MAYBE THEY DIDN'T KNOW
WE WERE OPEN.

42:59.244 --> 43:01.210
NO, THEY DID.

43:01.246 --> 43:02.845
I CALLED EVERY
RESERVATION

43:02.881 --> 43:04.681
AND THE ENTIRE
WAIT LIST.

43:04.716 --> 43:06.049
THEY KNEW.

43:08.353 --> 43:10.420
I GUESS THE PROSPECT
OF CYANIDE POISONING

43:10.455 --> 43:11.721
KILLED THEIR APPETITES.

43:32.444 --> 43:33.676
DIDN'T HAVE
A WAY TO CALL YOU,

43:33.712 --> 43:36.713
SO I JUST THOUGHT
I'D SWING BY.

43:36.748 --> 43:38.948
COULD'VE CALLED
THE RESTAURANT.

43:38.984 --> 43:39.949
WELL, I WANTED
TO MAKE SURE

43:39.985 --> 43:41.017
I GOT YOU IN
PERSON, THOUGH.

43:41.052 --> 43:42.318
MM.

43:44.723 --> 43:47.056
MAURICE DID RECEIVE A TEXT
FROM YOUR NUMBER.

43:47.092 --> 43:48.057
WE CHECKED HIS PHONE.

43:48.093 --> 43:49.425
HE DELETED THE TEXT,

43:49.461 --> 43:50.960
BUT TECH TEAM
FOUND IT AGAIN.

43:50.996 --> 43:53.630
WE LOCATED ALL THE
PHONE COMPANY RECORDS,

43:53.665 --> 43:54.931
AND IT TURNS OUT
THAT TEXT HE GOT...

43:56.334 --> 43:57.200
WAS SPOOFED.

43:57.235 --> 43:58.935
SPOOFED?

43:58.970 --> 44:00.103
SOMEONE USED
AN ILLEGAL PROGRAM

44:00.138 --> 44:02.405
TO SUBSTITUTE YOUR NUMBER
FOR THEIRS,

44:02.440 --> 44:04.807
AND THE ONLY WAY TO CATCH THAT
IS THE SERIAL NUMBER.

44:04.843 --> 44:06.476
OH, AND WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?

44:06.511 --> 44:09.445
DIDN'T MATCH YOUR PHONE.

44:09.481 --> 44:10.446
SO YOU WERE RIGHT.

44:11.750 --> 44:13.783
LOOKS LIKE
SOMEONE SET HIM UP.

44:13.818 --> 44:15.385
ANY IDEA WHO THAT WAS?

44:15.420 --> 44:16.986
OH, NO, THE SERIAL NUMBER
WAS FAKE, TOO.

44:17.022 --> 44:18.421
IT'S A PRETTY
GOOD TRICK.

44:18.456 --> 44:19.389
NO WAY TO TRACE IT.

44:19.424 --> 44:21.391
MM.

44:21.426 --> 44:22.358
WELL...

44:22.394 --> 44:25.028
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,
I COULD MAKE YOU DINNER.

44:26.531 --> 44:29.766
ABOUT TO TAKE THREE DOZEN STEAKS
DOWN TO A SOUP KITCHEN, SO...

44:29.801 --> 44:30.933
I WOULD LIKE THAT.

44:30.969 --> 44:31.934
COME ON.

44:40.378 --> 44:41.577
NOW I SEE
WHY YOU'RE SO FAMOUS.

44:43.181 --> 44:45.314
MAURICE IS
THE REAL CHEF,

44:45.350 --> 44:47.250
AND MY DAD.

44:47.285 --> 44:50.787
WELL, YOU DO
A GREAT IMPERSONATION.

44:52.357 --> 44:54.590
YEAH, WHEN I FIRST GOT
OUT OF COLLEGE,

44:54.626 --> 44:57.126
I WROTE FOOD REVIEWS
FOR THIS LITTLE PAPER.

44:57.162 --> 45:00.763
SO WHEN MY DAD
OPENED THE RESTAURANT,

45:00.799 --> 45:03.366
HE AND MAURICE
RAN THE KITCHEN.

45:03.401 --> 45:05.501
I DID THE "VISION" THING.

45:05.537 --> 45:06.936
WHAT WAS THE VISION?

45:06.971 --> 45:08.137
FOOD IS LOVE.

45:08.173 --> 45:10.106
I KNOW IT
SOUNDS CORNY,

45:10.141 --> 45:12.141
BUT IT WAS SO TRUE,

45:12.177 --> 45:13.543
FOR BOTH OF THEM,

45:13.578 --> 45:15.611
AND I WANTED PEOPLE
TO GET THAT MESSAGE.

45:16.915 --> 45:19.148
WELL, I THINK WE DO.

45:21.419 --> 45:23.519
YEAH, WELL,
IT WAS A LOT OF WORK,

45:23.555 --> 45:25.021
ESPECIALLY IN THE BEGINNING.

45:26.825 --> 45:28.624
IS THAT WHY
YOU NEVER GOT MARRIED?

45:28.660 --> 45:32.261
FUTURE SENATOR SAID
I MARRIED THE RESTAURANT.

45:33.398 --> 45:35.298
- OUCH.
- YEAH.

45:35.333 --> 45:39.335
AUNT CASSANDRA NEVER FELT
WE WERE A GREAT MATCH.

45:39.370 --> 45:41.738
THEN MY DAD DIED,

45:41.773 --> 45:44.040
AND I HAD TO TEACH MYSELF
HOW TO BE A CHEF.

45:44.075 --> 45:45.742
I WROTE A COOKBOOK,

45:45.777 --> 45:47.243
AND RUDY PUT ME
ON THE SHOW,

45:47.278 --> 45:50.880
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I ENDED UP HERE...

45:50.915 --> 45:52.181
COOKING DINNER FOR YOU.

45:54.219 --> 45:56.152
WELL, WHAT CAN I SAY?

45:56.187 --> 45:58.321
SOMETIMES, I GUESS
I JUST GET LUCKY.

45:59.791 --> 46:01.424
AND...

46:01.459 --> 46:03.025
WHY DID WE STOP DATING?

46:04.295 --> 46:06.129
TRUTHFULLY?

46:09.033 --> 46:11.534
WELL, YOU WERE HEADING OFF
TO COLLEGE,

46:11.569 --> 46:15.071
AND I WAS TRAINING TO BE A COP,

46:15.106 --> 46:18.207
SO I JUST TOLD MYSELF
YOU WERE OVER MY PAY GRADE.

46:18.243 --> 46:20.510
MY DAD WAS A COP.

46:22.046 --> 46:24.247
BY THE TIME
I PUT THAT TOGETHER,

46:24.282 --> 46:25.748
YOU WERE WITH THE SENATOR.

46:25.784 --> 46:28.718
AND BY THE TIME
HE AND I BROKE UP,

46:28.753 --> 46:29.685
YOU WERE MARRIED.

46:29.721 --> 46:32.955
YEAH.

46:32.991 --> 46:34.924
I GUESS WE JUST KEPT
MISSING EACH OTHER.

46:34.959 --> 46:37.627
UH, SPEAKING OF WHICH,

46:37.662 --> 46:39.195
ISN'T THERE SOME RULE

46:39.230 --> 46:42.064
ABOUT HAVING DINNER
WITH SUSPECTS?

46:42.100 --> 46:44.467
I DON'T SEE ANY SUSPECTS.

46:44.502 --> 46:45.601
YOU'RE NOT LOOKING
HARD ENOUGH.

46:45.637 --> 46:49.305
D.A. DECIDED
NOT TO PRESS CHARGES.

46:49.340 --> 46:50.773
OH!

46:50.809 --> 46:54.811
MAURICE, I CAN'T
BELIEVE YOU'RE HERE.

46:54.846 --> 46:56.112
I WANTED
TO TELL YOU.

46:56.147 --> 46:57.313
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW

46:57.348 --> 46:58.114
WHEN IT WOULD BE
OFFICIAL.

46:59.417 --> 47:00.383
YOU SHOULD GO.

47:00.418 --> 47:01.384
MAURICE!

47:01.419 --> 47:03.786
NO. IT'S OKAY.

47:03.822 --> 47:05.188
I'LL LET YOU TWO CATCH UP.

47:07.625 --> 47:10.226
THANK YOU.
IT'S AMAZING.

47:15.867 --> 47:17.233
WHAT WAS THAT
ALL ABOUT?

47:17.268 --> 47:20.102
I DON'T TRUST HIM,
AND YOU SHOULDN'T EITHER.

47:20.138 --> 47:21.003
HE'S THE REASON

47:21.039 --> 47:23.005
WHY THEY DECIDED
NOT TO PRESS CHARGES.

47:23.041 --> 47:24.941
MAYBE...

47:24.976 --> 47:26.409
OR MAYBE
THEY HAVE MORE INTEREST IN YOU.

47:32.517 --> 47:33.883
YOU REALLY THINK
I'M A SUSPECT?

47:33.918 --> 47:37.687
IAN'S PARTNER FOUND ME
OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE.

47:37.722 --> 47:39.188
HE SAID, "DON'T GET
TOO COMFORTABLE."

47:39.224 --> 47:40.957
AND IF THE POLICE THINK

47:40.992 --> 47:42.658
YOU BAKED THAT CAKE
FOR RUDY,

47:42.694 --> 47:43.626
HE'S GOING TO MAKE YOU PAY.

47:45.597 --> 47:49.332
AND RUDY DIED
IN YOUR RESTAURANT.

47:49.367 --> 47:52.401
I DON'T THINK IT'S WISE

47:52.437 --> 47:54.470
TO INVITE THE DETECTIVES
OVER TO DINNER.

47:54.505 --> 47:55.838
I DIDN'T INVITE HIM.

47:55.874 --> 47:58.374
HE JUST SHOWED UP.

47:58.409 --> 47:59.342
YOU KNOW
WHAT YOUR FATHER SAID

47:59.377 --> 48:01.177
ABOUT IAN JACKSON?

48:01.212 --> 48:02.411
HE'S NICE,

48:02.447 --> 48:04.013
AND THAT'S
HIS SUPERPOWER.

48:04.048 --> 48:06.249
CRIMINALS,
THEY TRUST HIM,

48:06.284 --> 48:09.585
AND YOU COULD BE
TELLING HIM THINGS

48:09.621 --> 48:11.053
THAT COULD GET YOU IN TROUBLE,

48:11.089 --> 48:12.188
AND YOU WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW.

48:12.223 --> 48:14.223
I GAVE HIM MY PHONE.

48:14.259 --> 48:16.192
WHAT?

48:16.227 --> 48:18.394
AND I HAVE THE CYANIDE.
IT'S IN MY CLOSET.

48:20.064 --> 48:21.264
WELL, LOOK,
YOU DIDN'T HIDE IT VERY WELL.

48:21.299 --> 48:22.732
IT WAS RIGHT IN YOUR CUPBOARD.

48:22.767 --> 48:24.233
WHY WOULD YOU TAKE IT?

48:24.269 --> 48:26.602
I DIDN'T WANT THE POLICE
TO SEARCH YOUR APARTMENT.

48:26.638 --> 48:28.871
AND WHAT HAPPENS
IF THEY SEARCH YOUR HOUSE?

48:28.907 --> 48:31.040
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN
THAT FAR YET.

48:31.075 --> 48:32.508
YOU WERE IN JAIL, NOT ME.

48:34.946 --> 48:37.213
COME ON, FEATHERS.

48:37.248 --> 48:39.048
ATTABOY.

48:39.083 --> 48:42.718
YOU DO THAT EVERY NIGHT?

48:42.754 --> 48:44.186
MAURICE TERREBONE.

48:44.222 --> 48:45.688
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D BE SO HAPPY

48:45.723 --> 48:48.090
TO SEE YOU FUSSING
OVER THAT DOG.

48:49.928 --> 48:51.761
THEY THINK BILLIE DID IT?

48:51.796 --> 48:53.296
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

48:53.331 --> 48:54.597
WELL, THAT DETECTIVE
NEEDS TO WORK

48:54.632 --> 48:56.365
ON HIS POWERS OF OBSERVATION.

48:56.401 --> 48:58.968
BILLIE WAS RUDY'S ONLY FRIEND,

48:59.003 --> 49:00.903
AND THERE'S A WHOLE PHONEBOOK
OF PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T LIKE HIM,

49:00.939 --> 49:03.205
STARTING WITH THAT PRICKLY ONE
HE WAS ABOUT TO MARRY.

49:03.241 --> 49:04.273
GRETCHEN.

49:04.309 --> 49:05.141
YEAH, GRETCHEN...
DIDN'T YOU SAY

49:05.176 --> 49:07.443
THAT THEY HAD
SOME KIND OF BIG FIGHT

49:07.478 --> 49:08.544
RIGHT BEFORE HE DIED?

49:08.579 --> 49:10.947
YEAH, GRETCHEN THOUGHT RUDY
WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR.

49:12.183 --> 49:13.482
MM-HMM.

49:13.518 --> 49:15.418
LOOKS LIKE TROUBLE TO ME.

49:15.453 --> 49:17.787
TIFFANY SAID THEIR RELATIONSHIP
WAS STRICTLY PROFESSIONAL.

49:17.822 --> 49:20.323
OF COURSE
SHE SAID THAT.

49:20.358 --> 49:22.658
MY FIRST HUSBAND?
DENY, DENY, DENY.

49:22.694 --> 49:24.827
THEY DENY WHEN YOU
CATCH THEM RED-HANDED.

49:24.862 --> 49:27.263
IT'S WHAT
THEY CLING TO.

49:27.298 --> 49:29.098
OH, LOOK.

49:29.133 --> 49:32.568
LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE BEEN
TALKING BUSINESS FOR A WHILE.

49:32.603 --> 49:34.170
CHRISTMAS WAS
NINE MONTHS AGO,

49:34.205 --> 49:35.738
AND WE WEREN'T EVEN
LOOKING FOR A CO-HOST.

49:35.773 --> 49:37.306
WELL, I GUESS
GRETCHEN HAD PLENTY OF TIME

49:37.342 --> 49:38.307
TO BUILD UP A RESENTMENT.

49:38.343 --> 49:40.776
I THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
STALKING TIFFANY.

49:40.812 --> 49:42.678
I HOPE TIFFANY TOLD THE POLICE.

49:42.714 --> 49:44.113
SHE WAS TOO AFRAID.

49:44.148 --> 49:45.915
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HER.
SHE WAS TERRIFIED.

49:50.855 --> 49:51.787
TIFFANY MOON?

49:54.058 --> 49:55.825
I REALLY CAN'T TALK.

49:55.860 --> 49:56.959
IT SHOULDN'T TAKE LONG.

49:58.296 --> 50:00.296
THOSE PHOTOS
ARE MISLEADING.

50:00.331 --> 50:02.431
RUDY AND I WERE NOT
IN A RELATIONSHIP.

50:02.467 --> 50:03.399
ACCORDING TO HIS PHONE RECORDS,

50:03.434 --> 50:04.967
YOU CALLED HIS PRIVATE NUMBER
ONCE A MONTH

50:05.003 --> 50:06.602
FOR THE LAST NINE MONTHS.

50:06.637 --> 50:07.837
I CAN EXPLAIN.

50:07.872 --> 50:09.472
I WAS HOPING YOU'D SAY THAT.

50:21.352 --> 50:23.185
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

50:23.221 --> 50:26.122
THE SAME AS YOU.
PAYING MY RESPECTS.

50:26.157 --> 50:28.157
KIKI TELL YOU
I'M GOING ON STRIKE?

50:28.192 --> 50:29.392
EVERYTHING OUT OF FOCUS

50:29.427 --> 50:30.626
'TIL YOU'RE
BACK ON THE SHOW,

50:30.661 --> 50:31.660
WITH COOKIES.

50:31.696 --> 50:34.230
CHAPTER TEN, "GOOD COOKIES
MAKE GOOD FRIENDS."

50:34.265 --> 50:35.998
IT'S NO FUN
WITHOUT YOU.

50:36.034 --> 50:37.767
I'M FUN.

50:39.170 --> 50:40.536
STILL WORKING
ON THAT SPREADSHEET?

50:40.571 --> 50:42.338
WHO GETS A STAR TODAY?

50:42.373 --> 50:43.339
GRETCHEN.

50:43.374 --> 50:44.306
YEAH,

50:44.342 --> 50:45.307
PRETTY SURE SHE LEFT
A THREATENING MESSAGE

50:45.343 --> 50:46.409
FOR TIFFANY,

50:46.444 --> 50:47.643
ON HER CAR,

50:47.678 --> 50:48.844
IN LIPSTICK.

50:48.880 --> 50:50.046
OKAY.

50:50.081 --> 50:51.680
THAT'S UNSETTLING.

50:53.384 --> 50:54.483
HMM.

50:54.519 --> 50:55.484
HOW LONG DO YOU
THINK I HAVE

50:55.520 --> 50:56.919
BEFORE SHE KICKS ME OUT?

50:56.954 --> 50:58.354
SHE CAN'T KICK YOU
OUT OF A FUNERAL.

50:58.389 --> 50:59.855
SAYS WHO?

51:01.292 --> 51:02.992
I NEED TO TALK TO TIFFANY.

51:03.027 --> 51:04.860
REMIND ME TO CALL HER

51:04.896 --> 51:06.495
NEXT TIME I NEED
A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR.

51:11.069 --> 51:13.002
BILLIE BLESSINGS.

51:13.037 --> 51:14.336
I HEARD YOU GOT YOURSELF FIRED.

51:14.372 --> 51:17.273
WELL, YOUR FANS
ARE IN AN UPROAR.

51:17.308 --> 51:18.674
I DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU HAD SO MANY.

51:18.709 --> 51:19.942
WE'RE GETTING SLAMMED
ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

51:19.977 --> 51:21.610
I'M SORRY.

51:21.646 --> 51:23.112
HEY, I TOLD MY DAUGHTER
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

51:23.147 --> 51:24.880
I COULDN'T TALK HER
OUT OF IT.

51:24.916 --> 51:27.016
SHE'S A LITTLE TEMPERAMENTAL.

51:27.051 --> 51:29.885
DO YOU THINK WE HAVE
ENOUGH TEA SANDWICHES?

51:29.921 --> 51:31.253
GET OUT OF MY WAY.

51:31.289 --> 51:33.389
AND HERE SHE IS.
PERFECT TIMING.

51:33.424 --> 51:35.191
YOU MADE YOUR POWER PLAY.

51:35.226 --> 51:37.026
NOW I'D APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU'D LEAVE SO I CAN MOURN.

51:37.061 --> 51:38.461
I WAS JUST SAYING,
WE NEED TO FIND A WAY

51:38.496 --> 51:39.962
TO GET BILLIE
BACK ON THE SHOW.

51:39.997 --> 51:41.864
WE'LL HAVE TIFFANY
INTERVIEW HER.

51:41.899 --> 51:42.965
THEY CAN FACT-CHECK
A FEW RUMORS.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.100
MAYBE EVEN FIND
THE KILLER,

51:44.135 --> 51:45.901
FLUSH THEM
OUT OF HIDING.

51:45.937 --> 51:48.270
DO WE REALLY WANT THE SHOW
TO HAVE THAT KIND OF REPUTATION?

51:48.306 --> 51:49.905
YES.

51:49.941 --> 51:53.075
I MEAN, YES,
I WOULD LIKE TO BE ON THE SHOW.

51:53.111 --> 51:54.376
NO, IT'S TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE.

51:54.412 --> 51:56.245
GREAT, THE MORE
INAPPROPRIATE, THE BETTER.

51:56.280 --> 51:58.013
OUR RATINGS WILL GO
THROUGH THE ROOF.

52:03.087 --> 52:05.721
I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

52:11.596 --> 52:14.096
SHE CLAIMS SHE SENT RUDY
A DEMO LAST CHRISTMAS.

52:15.266 --> 52:17.366
SHE WANTED TO DO
A STYLE SEGMENT.

52:18.803 --> 52:19.902
RUDY TOOK AN INTEREST.

52:19.937 --> 52:21.403
HIS FIANCEE SAID

52:21.439 --> 52:22.838
THERE WASN'T ENOUGH MONEY
IN THE BUDGET.

52:22.874 --> 52:24.106
SMART WOMAN.

52:24.142 --> 52:25.741
DOES IT STRIKE YOU AS STRANGE

52:25.776 --> 52:27.743
THAT TIFFANY TRIES
TO GET ON THE SHOW,

52:27.778 --> 52:29.145
AND SIX MONTHS LATER,
LANIE HAYWOOD DIES?

52:29.180 --> 52:30.112
THAT WAS
A FOOD ALLERGY.

52:35.319 --> 52:37.453
TIFFANY WAS
PRETTY JUMPY YESTERDAY.

52:37.488 --> 52:39.321
SHE'S HIDING SOMETHING.

52:42.493 --> 52:44.326
WHAT IF RUDY
KILLED LANIE

52:44.362 --> 52:46.028
SO HE COULD PUT
TIFFANY ON THE SHOW?

52:46.063 --> 52:47.596
BECAUSE HE WANTED
TO BE WITH HER?

52:47.632 --> 52:51.033
MAYBE.

52:51.068 --> 52:52.468
THEN ONCE TIFFANY GOT
A SIGNED CONTRACT,

52:52.503 --> 52:53.769
SHE GOT RID OF HIM.

52:56.007 --> 52:57.306
HEY...

52:57.341 --> 52:58.440
DID YOU KNOW
ABOUT THIS?

53:06.250 --> 53:08.117
NO.

53:08.152 --> 53:10.653
AND WE ARE BACK!

53:10.688 --> 53:11.520
WELL, VIEWERS,

53:11.556 --> 53:13.322
WE HAVE A VERY
SPECIAL GUEST TODAY...

53:13.357 --> 53:14.823
BILLIE BLESSINGS.

53:14.859 --> 53:15.958
GOOD TO HAVE YOU
BACK, BILLIE.

53:15.993 --> 53:17.459
IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE.

53:17.495 --> 53:18.827
I'M GOING
TO CUT RIGHT TO THE CHASE.

53:18.863 --> 53:20.462
A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW

53:20.498 --> 53:23.165
HOW RUDY SLATER
GOT THAT POISONED CAKE.

53:23.201 --> 53:24.833
LET'S ASK
THE QUESTION.

53:24.869 --> 53:25.801
DID YOU BAKE IT?

53:27.438 --> 53:28.804
WHO DO YOU THINK
BAKED THE CAKE?

53:34.045 --> 53:34.977
UH...

53:38.683 --> 53:40.015
I'M NOT SURE.

53:40.051 --> 53:41.984
YOU MUST HAVE SOME IDEA.

53:42.019 --> 53:43.419
THE OTHER DAY,

53:43.454 --> 53:44.820
YOU SAID YOU WERE
FEELING THREATENED.

53:44.855 --> 53:46.155
DID I SAY THAT?

53:46.190 --> 53:48.157
I DON'T REMEMBER.

53:48.192 --> 53:49.425
IT SOUNDED

53:49.460 --> 53:50.826
LIKE RUDY WAS WORRIED
FOR YOUR SAFETY.

53:52.964 --> 53:54.763
<i>I DOUBT I USED
THOSE EXACT WORDS.</i>

53:54.799 --> 53:56.198
<i>THAT SOUNDS
PRETTY DRAMATIC.</i>

53:56.234 --> 53:58.500
SHE'S COMPLETELY
OFF-SCRIPT.

53:58.536 --> 54:00.269
SHOULD I CUT
TO COMMERCIAL?

54:00.304 --> 54:02.004
THREATENING
MESSAGES ON YOUR CAR...

54:02.039 --> 54:03.038
KEEP IT GOING.

54:03.074 --> 54:04.340
<i>POSTED PICTURES
OF YOU AND RUDY</i>

54:04.375 --> 54:05.474
<i>ON THE INTERNET.</i>

54:05.509 --> 54:07.443
<i>OH, THOSE PICTURES
ARE NOT ACCURATE.</i>

54:07.478 --> 54:08.210
<i>NO, I MEAN, THEY HAPPENED,</i>

54:08.246 --> 54:09.411
<i>BUT NOT THE
WAY IT LOOKS.</i>

54:09.447 --> 54:15.050
<i>MY RELATIONSHIP WITH RUDY
WAS STRICTLY PROFESSIONAL.</i>

54:15.086 --> 54:16.752
<i>RUDY FIGURED OUT
WHO WAS TRYING TO HURT YOU</i>

54:16.787 --> 54:18.287
<i>BEFORE HE DIED, DIDN'T HE?</i>

54:18.322 --> 54:20.889
<i>HE TOLD YOU HE HAD PROOF.</i>

54:20.925 --> 54:22.258
I GUESS
THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS HIDING.

54:22.293 --> 54:24.493
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL THE POLICE?

54:24.528 --> 54:26.328
DON'T WORRY.

54:26.364 --> 54:28.097
WE'RE ALL HERE
FOR YOU.

54:28.132 --> 54:29.231
I PROMISE,

54:29.267 --> 54:31.033
WE'RE GOING
TO KEEP YOU SAFE.

54:38.676 --> 54:40.476
I DIDN'T TELL THE POLICE...

54:42.380 --> 54:44.346
BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID.

54:44.382 --> 54:46.248
DO YOU KNOW WHO KILLED RUDY?

54:46.284 --> 54:48.951
NO...

54:48.986 --> 54:50.953
BUT I THINK
THEY KILLED LANIE.

54:50.988 --> 54:52.154
LANIE HAYWOOD?

54:52.189 --> 54:53.422
<i>RUDY NEVER
UNDERSTOOD</i>

54:53.457 --> 54:55.524
<i>HOW SHE DIED
FROM HAZELNUT COFFEE.</i>

54:55.559 --> 54:58.127
<i>SHE WAS TOO CAREFUL
WITH HER FOOD ALLERGIES,</i>

54:58.162 --> 55:00.029
SO WHEN I STARTED
RECEIVING THREATS,

55:00.064 --> 55:03.432
HE SAID HE THOUGHT
LANIE HAD BEEN POISONED.

55:04.969 --> 55:07.202
WE NEED A TOX SCREEN
ON LANIE HAYWOOD.

55:07.238 --> 55:09.171
I WANT HER TESTED
FOR EVERYTHING...

55:09.206 --> 55:10.939
ESPECIALLY CYANIDE.

55:20.985 --> 55:22.484
A LITTLE TOUGH TO GET
A WORD IN EDGEWISE,

55:22.520 --> 55:24.420
BUT THAT WAS
QUITE THE SCOOP.

55:24.455 --> 55:26.021
NICE JOB?

55:26.057 --> 55:27.589
I THINK SHE'S THE MOST
CLEVER PERSON

55:27.625 --> 55:29.258
I HAVE EVER MET.

55:29.293 --> 55:30.392
WELL, NOT REALLY THAT CLEVER.

55:30.428 --> 55:32.294
I WASN'T REALLY SURE
WHICH WAY THAT WAS GOING TO GO.

55:32.330 --> 55:33.796
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU WERE DOING AT FIRST,

55:33.831 --> 55:36.865
AND THEN I REALIZED
THAT IF I TOLD EVERYBODY ON TV,

55:36.901 --> 55:38.267
NOBODY COULD HURT ME.

55:38.302 --> 55:41.937
I FEEL SAFE
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN WEEKS.

55:41.972 --> 55:44.773
LANIE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MURDERED.

55:44.809 --> 55:45.741
NOW IS NOT THE TIME
TO CELEBRATE.

55:48.679 --> 55:50.612
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN WRONG
ABOUT YOU, TIFFANY.

55:50.648 --> 55:51.814
FOR THAT, I'M SORRY.

55:51.849 --> 55:54.616
I HAD NO IDEA YOU
WERE SO FRIGHTENED.

55:55.820 --> 55:57.019
LET'S TALK.

56:01.492 --> 56:02.491
BILLIE,

56:02.526 --> 56:03.959
THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST
AMAZING LIVE INTERVIEWS

56:03.994 --> 56:04.893
I HAVE EVER SEEN.

56:04.929 --> 56:05.928
I WISH I COULD HAVE DONE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

56:05.963 --> 56:08.964
YOU MUST REALLY BE PROUD.
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.

56:21.846 --> 56:23.412
FIRST LESSON
OF LIVE TELEVISION,

56:23.447 --> 56:26.148
YOU NEVER GET WHAT YOU EXPECT.

56:26.183 --> 56:28.484
YOU LOOKED A LITTLE SURPRISED
OUT THERE.

56:28.519 --> 56:29.485
MAYBE YOU WERE HOPING

56:29.520 --> 56:32.421
THAT TIFFANY WOULD SAY
GRETCHEN KILLED RUDY.

56:32.456 --> 56:34.757
TO BE HONEST,
I'VE WONDERED THAT MYSELF.

56:34.792 --> 56:35.891
I SAW THOSE PICTURES
ON THE INTERNET,

56:35.926 --> 56:37.659
AND BELIEVE ME,

56:37.695 --> 56:40.195
I CAUGHT AN EARFUL WHEN I SIGNED
TIFFANY'S CONTRACT.

56:40.231 --> 56:42.331
YEAH, I HAVE
TO ADMIT,

56:42.366 --> 56:44.066
I WAS STARTING TO GET
A LITTLE WORRIED...

56:44.101 --> 56:46.902
RIGHT UP
UNTIL THAT LANIE SHOCKER.

56:46.937 --> 56:47.903
DOESN'T IT BOTHER YOU

56:47.938 --> 56:49.071
THAT TWO PEOPLE
WE CARED ABOUT

56:49.106 --> 56:51.240
WERE MURDERED?

56:54.044 --> 56:55.377
I LIKE YOU, BILLIE,

56:55.413 --> 56:57.012
BUT GRETCHEN IS MY LITTLE GIRL.

56:57.047 --> 56:58.614
IF YOU HURT HER,

56:58.649 --> 57:00.849
I WILL MAKE YOU PAY.

57:07.725 --> 57:09.224
LISTEN...

57:09.260 --> 57:11.560
TIFFANY WAS AFRAID.

57:11.595 --> 57:12.795
I WANTED
TO HELP HER TALK.

57:12.830 --> 57:14.930
I HAD NO IDEA SHE WAS GOING
TO SAY THAT STUFF ABOUT LANIE.

57:14.965 --> 57:16.098
YOU SHOULD STOP.

57:16.133 --> 57:19.535
WE NEED TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS.

57:19.570 --> 57:22.771
NOBODY EVER SUSPECTED
LANIE HAYWOOD WAS POISONED.

57:22.807 --> 57:23.906
WHAT DID YOU HOPE
TO GAIN

57:23.941 --> 57:25.707
BY BRINGING IT UP
ON LIVE TV?

57:25.743 --> 57:26.642
I DIDN'T BRING IT UP.

57:26.677 --> 57:27.910
TIFFANY DID.

57:27.945 --> 57:29.311
I THINK
YOU HAD TIFFANY ANNOUNCE IT

57:29.346 --> 57:30.712
TO MAKE YOURSELF LOOK INNOCENT.

57:30.748 --> 57:32.080
HIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT.

57:32.116 --> 57:33.582
WHAT WOULD I BE HIDING?

57:33.617 --> 57:34.583
YOU TELL ME.

57:34.618 --> 57:36.285
GRETCHEN DIVOSS SAID

57:36.320 --> 57:38.220
YOU BAKED MUFFINS
THE DAY LANIE DIED.

57:38.255 --> 57:39.655
THREE PEOPLE SAID

57:39.690 --> 57:41.423
THEY SAW YOU
GIVE ONE TO LANIE.

57:41.459 --> 57:42.491
YOU THINK I POISONED HER?

57:42.526 --> 57:45.260
RUDY FOUND OUT,
YOU POISONED HIM, TOO.

57:45.296 --> 57:46.495
YOU HAD MAURICE TERREBONE

57:46.530 --> 57:48.964
DELIVER THAT CAKE
RIGHT ON CAMERA,

57:48.999 --> 57:49.932
AND THEN YOU SENT HIM
A FAKE TEXT

57:49.967 --> 57:51.333
TO GET BOTH OF YOU OFF THE HOOK.

57:51.368 --> 57:53.569
I DID NOT SEND THAT TEXT.

57:53.604 --> 57:54.803
OKAY, BUT YOU DID WRITE
THAT SCARY MESSAGE

57:54.839 --> 57:55.871
IN YOUR OWN HOUSE

57:55.906 --> 57:57.806
TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
THE KILLER WAS STALKING YOU.

57:57.842 --> 57:59.341
WHY ASSUME THAT?

57:59.376 --> 58:00.142
WOULDN'T IT MAKE MORE SENSE

58:00.177 --> 58:01.677
THAT SOMEONE BROKE
INTO MY HOUSE?

58:01.712 --> 58:02.611
WE FOUND
A RECEIPT ON YOUR PHONE.

58:02.646 --> 58:03.812
YOU BOUGHT LIPSTICK.

58:03.848 --> 58:05.080
<i>PASSION FLOWER.</i>

58:05.115 --> 58:06.648
IT MATCHES
THE LIPSTICK

58:06.684 --> 58:08.951
THAT WAS USED
ON TIFFANY'S CAR,

58:08.986 --> 58:11.753
AND IN RUDY'S WINE CLOSET.

58:11.789 --> 58:12.788
WELL, YOU MUST SEE
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

58:12.823 --> 58:14.423
SOMEONE IS SETTING ME UP.

58:14.458 --> 58:16.158
WE ARE EXPLORING
OTHER SUSPECTS,

58:16.193 --> 58:17.493
BUT THE EVIDENCE
IS PRETTY STRONG.

58:17.528 --> 58:19.661
I DIDN'T WANT LANIE'S JOB.

58:19.697 --> 58:21.463
I TOLD RUDY
I WOULDN'T TAKE IT.

58:21.499 --> 58:23.031
THAT'S A CONVENIENT STORY,

58:23.067 --> 58:25.300
SINCE RUDY'S NOT HERE
TO CONFIRM OR DENY IT.

58:25.336 --> 58:27.269
AM I UNDER ARREST?

58:27.304 --> 58:30.706
WE HAVE TO WAIT
FOR LANIE'S TOX SCREEN.

58:30.741 --> 58:32.040
I DIDN'T KILL ANYONE.

58:32.076 --> 58:33.609
THAT'S WHAT
MY PARTNER THINKS.

58:33.644 --> 58:36.311
MYSELF, I'M STARTING
TO ACQUIRE A FEW DOUBTS.

58:43.921 --> 58:45.320
KIKI OWENS?

58:49.827 --> 58:51.860
HEY, SO--
SO WHAT DID THE COPS SAY?

58:51.896 --> 58:53.362
DID THEY MENTION
THAT LIST?

58:53.397 --> 58:54.496
PEOPLE RUDY WANTED
TO FIRE?

58:54.532 --> 58:55.664
THEY DON'T CARE
ABOUT THAT LIST.

58:55.699 --> 58:56.798
THEY THINK
I DID IT.

58:56.834 --> 58:58.200
WHAT? WHY?

58:58.235 --> 59:00.335
BECAUSE I WANTED
LANIE'S JOB.

59:00.371 --> 59:01.203
NO, NO, NO, NO,

59:01.238 --> 59:03.071
YOU'RE THE NICEST PERSON
ON THIS SHOW.

59:03.107 --> 59:04.740
THAT'S NOT
WHAT THE POLICE THINK.

59:04.775 --> 59:05.674
WELL IF IT'S
ABOUT LANIE'S JOB,

59:05.709 --> 59:07.976
THEN THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING
AT TIFFANY.

59:08.012 --> 59:08.944
I MEAN, SHE'S THE ONE
THAT GOT IT,

59:08.979 --> 59:11.647
PLUS SHE TRIED TO GET
ON THE SHOW BEFORE.

59:11.682 --> 59:12.981
TIFFANY?

59:13.017 --> 59:14.316
YEAH, SHE SENT US A DEMO
LAST CHRISTMAS.

59:14.351 --> 59:15.484
SHE WANTED TO DO,
LIKE, A STYLE SEGMENT.

59:15.519 --> 59:16.885
PHIL!

59:16.921 --> 59:18.820
OH, NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO.

59:18.856 --> 59:20.822
DON'T GO ALL SHERLOCK
ON ME.

59:20.858 --> 59:23.325
I'M NOT SAYING
THAT TIFFANY KILLED LANIE.

59:23.360 --> 59:24.993
WHAT IF SHE DID?

59:25.029 --> 59:26.128
FIRST OF ALL,

59:26.163 --> 59:27.829
YOU SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION
TO YOUR OWN INTERVIEW.

59:27.865 --> 59:30.265
RUDY DIDN'T THINK
TIFFANY WAS A KILLER.

59:30.301 --> 59:31.500
SHE WAS BEING THREATENED.

59:31.535 --> 59:33.001
HE WAS TRYING TO PROTECT HER.

59:33.037 --> 59:34.870
ACCORDING TO TIFFANY.

59:34.905 --> 59:36.538
MAYBE SHE MADE UP ALL THAT STUFF
ABOUT BEING THREATENED

59:36.574 --> 59:37.673
JUST TO THROW EVERYBODY OFF.

59:37.708 --> 59:38.807
NUMBER TWO,

59:38.842 --> 59:41.944
TIFFANY DOES NOT HAVE
THE BANDWIDTH TO KILL ANYONE.

59:41.979 --> 59:43.512
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
SHE WANTS US TO THINK.

59:43.547 --> 59:44.746
SHE HAS THE MOTIVE.

59:46.150 --> 59:48.617
WE KNOW RUDY WAS LOOKING
AT AUDITION FOOTAGE.

59:48.652 --> 59:51.086
MAYBE WE SHOULD CHECK OUT
THAT DEMO REEL.

59:51.121 --> 59:52.154
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE NOTICED,

59:52.189 --> 59:54.756
BUT THERE ARE COPS
CRAWLING ALL OVER THIS PLACE.

59:54.792 --> 59:55.924
I SHOULDN'T EVEN BE
TALKING TO YOU.

59:55.960 --> 59:57.459
YOU COULD GIVE ME
THAT PASSWORD.

59:57.494 --> 59:59.361
THE AUDITION FOOTAGE
ISN'T ON THE SERVER.

59:59.396 --> 01:00:00.762
YOU CAN ONLY ACCESS IT
FROM TWO COMPUTERS,

01:00:00.798 --> 01:00:02.264
RUDY'S AND MINE.

01:00:02.299 --> 01:00:03.765
I CAN MEET YOU AFTER WORK.

01:00:05.502 --> 01:00:06.635
WHY ARE YOU
STILL HERE?

01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:10.339
YOU NEED TO LEAVE,
RIGHT NOW...

01:00:11.842 --> 01:00:13.575
AND IF I EVER SEE YOU
TALKING TO HER AGAIN,

01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:14.543
YOU'RE FIRED.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.753
WHERE ARE YOU?

01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:26.221
ON MY WAY HOME...

01:00:26.256 --> 01:00:27.222
OR JAIL.

01:00:27.257 --> 01:00:28.256
I'M NOT SURE.

01:00:28.292 --> 01:00:29.224
YOU SEE THE INTERVIEW?

01:00:29.259 --> 01:00:30.626
LISTEN, UM...

01:00:30.661 --> 01:00:31.560
THE COPS ARE HERE
SEARCHING YOUR HOUSE.

01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:33.662
MAURICE...

01:00:33.697 --> 01:00:34.463
DON'T WORRY,
I TOOK CARE OF IT

01:00:34.498 --> 01:00:36.431
WHILE YOU WERE
AT RUDY'S FUNERAL.

01:00:36.467 --> 01:00:39.067
<i>UH, I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD COME BACK YET.</i>

01:00:39.103 --> 01:00:40.135
OKAY.

01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:42.571
LAY LOW FOR A WHILE.

01:00:53.951 --> 01:00:55.117
IT'S NICE TO KNOW
IT'S STILL YOUR FAVORITE PLACE.

01:00:59.289 --> 01:01:01.490
LET ME GUESS.

01:01:01.525 --> 01:01:04.660
YOU'RE WAITING FOR THE POLICE
TO FINISH SEARCHING YOUR HOUSE.

01:01:04.695 --> 01:01:06.128
CAN YOU BLAME ME?

01:01:08.332 --> 01:01:10.098
PEACE OFFERING.

01:01:10.134 --> 01:01:13.468
MY DETECTIVE PARTNER
GOT A LITTLE OVERHEATED.

01:01:13.504 --> 01:01:16.772
SO IS THIS
SOME NEW STRATEGY

01:01:16.807 --> 01:01:18.006
SO I DON'T REALIZE

01:01:18.042 --> 01:01:20.142
I'M BEING
INTERROGATED?

01:01:20.177 --> 01:01:21.843
LOOK...

01:01:21.879 --> 01:01:24.012
I DON'T THINK YOU KILLED RUDY.

01:01:24.048 --> 01:01:25.947
YOU COULD TALK TO ME, THOUGH,
AND TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW.

01:01:25.983 --> 01:01:28.684
IT'D HELP ME.

01:01:28.719 --> 01:01:30.652
TALK TO YOU
AS A DETECTIVE,

01:01:30.688 --> 01:01:32.120
OR AS A FRIEND?

01:01:32.156 --> 01:01:34.790
WELL, DETECTIVES HAVE FRIENDS.

01:01:36.326 --> 01:01:39.394
WELL, AT LEAST
THAT'S WHAT I'VE HEARD.

01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:41.663
LOOK, IAN...
TIFFANY MOON

01:01:41.699 --> 01:01:42.864
WAS AT RUDY'S
APARTMENT

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:44.700
THE DAY HE DIED.

01:01:44.735 --> 01:01:46.835
SHE GOT IN THROUGH
SOME SIDE ENTRANCE

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:47.836
SO NO ONE
WOULD SEE HER

01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:48.904
GETTING IN
THE BUILDING.

01:01:48.939 --> 01:01:50.138
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY
SOMETHING BEFORE?

01:01:50.174 --> 01:01:51.673
I WAS TRYING
TO PROTECT HER.

01:01:51.709 --> 01:01:53.008
SHE SAID

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:54.376
THAT IF THE KILLER KNEW
THAT SHE WAS THERE,

01:01:54.411 --> 01:01:55.177
THEY MIGHT TRY
TO HURT HER,

01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:57.546
BUT NOW I'M STARTING
TO WONDER...

01:01:57.581 --> 01:01:59.548
AND YOU NEED
TO CHECK THAT DEMO,

01:01:59.583 --> 01:02:01.249
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S ON IT,

01:02:01.285 --> 01:02:02.684
BUT RUDY WAS DEFINITELY LOOKING
FOR IT

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:03.585
BEFORE HE DIED.

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:05.420
OKAY.

01:02:05.456 --> 01:02:06.421
THANK YOU.

01:02:06.457 --> 01:02:07.489
FOR WHAT?

01:02:07.524 --> 01:02:08.557
FOR TRUSTING ME.

01:02:20.637 --> 01:02:21.903
PHIL?

01:02:40.157 --> 01:02:41.056
PHIL!

01:02:45.062 --> 01:02:46.027
PHIL!

01:03:01.178 --> 01:03:02.711
IT'S A GOOD THIN

01:03:02.746 --> 01:03:03.578
THE WHOLE HOUSE
WOULD HAVE BURNED DOWN,

01:03:03.614 --> 01:03:05.313
WITH HIM IN IT.

01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:06.414
IS HE GOING
TO BE OKAY?

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:07.749
YEAH, HE SEEMS OKAY.

01:03:07.785 --> 01:03:09.785
THEY'RE TAKING HIM
TO THE E.R. TO BE SURE.

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:10.519
I'M GOING
TO NEED YOUR NAME

01:03:10.554 --> 01:03:12.087
AND CONTACT
INFORMATION, PLEASE.

01:03:12.122 --> 01:03:13.922
EXCUSE ME!

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:15.891
OH, ONE SECOND.

01:03:15.926 --> 01:03:16.992
HEY, DO I KNOW YOU?

01:03:17.027 --> 01:03:18.426
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

01:03:18.462 --> 01:03:20.495
PEOPLE ARE KILLING
MY GRASS.

01:03:20.531 --> 01:03:21.797
OKAY, MA'AM...

01:03:34.444 --> 01:03:35.844
BILLIE TEXTS ME.

01:03:35.879 --> 01:03:37.145
SHE ASKS ME TO MEET
HER AT MY HOUSE

01:03:37.181 --> 01:03:39.981
SO WE COULD LOOK AT
TIFFANY MOON'S DEMO.

01:03:40.017 --> 01:03:42.017
I PUT THIS CRAZY
IDEA IN HER HEAD

01:03:42.052 --> 01:03:44.085
THAT TIFFANY
KILLED LANIE

01:03:44.121 --> 01:03:45.520
TO GET HER JOB,

01:03:45.556 --> 01:03:47.622
AND, I DON'T KNOW,
I FELT REALLY BAD ABOUT IT.

01:03:47.658 --> 01:03:48.490
SO I WENT HOME.

01:03:48.525 --> 01:03:50.192
I FIGURED
I COULD SHOW BILLIE THE TAPE

01:03:50.227 --> 01:03:51.793
AND WE'D JUST PUT IT ALL
BEHIND US,

01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:53.195
BUT AS SOON AS I WALKED
IN THAT DOOR,

01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:56.264
SOMEONE CRACKED ME
ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD.

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:57.532
THAT'S THE LAST THING
I REMEMBER.

01:03:57.568 --> 01:03:58.667
YOU THINK BILLIE DID IT?

01:03:58.702 --> 01:04:00.435
NO.

01:04:04.474 --> 01:04:06.208
WE'RE GOING TO NEED
A COPY OF THAT DEMO.

01:04:06.243 --> 01:04:08.610
IF YOU THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE,
GIVE ME A CALL.

01:04:08.645 --> 01:04:10.145
YEAH.

01:04:11.849 --> 01:04:14.182
WE'VE GOT TO GET
A COPY OF TIFFANY'S DEMO.

01:04:14.218 --> 01:04:16.384
HE KNEW SHE WAS COMING OVER.

01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:17.552
WHY IS HE PROTECTING HER?

01:04:17.588 --> 01:04:18.954
WELL, LET'S
CHECK HER GPS.

01:04:18.989 --> 01:04:20.288
SEE IF IT PUTS HER
AT NARDI'S HOUSE.

01:04:20.324 --> 01:04:21.723
NO, WE CAN'T.

01:04:21.758 --> 01:04:23.024
WE HAVE HER
TRACKING DATA,

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:24.392
AND IT'S LEGAL.
SHE GAVE US THE PHONE.

01:04:24.428 --> 01:04:25.460
IT'S NOT HOW I WORK.

01:04:25.495 --> 01:04:27.329
YEAH, I KNOW
HOW YOU WORK.

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:29.064
FRIENDS WITH EVERYONE.

01:04:29.099 --> 01:04:30.532
IRON FIST IN A VELVET GLOVE.

01:04:30.567 --> 01:04:33.034
YOU SEEMED A LITTLE
TOO COZY WITH HER

01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:35.370
THE OTHER NIGHT,
WHEN SHE MADE YOU DINNER.

01:04:35.405 --> 01:04:37.572
SO YOU TRACKING ME NOW, TOO?

01:04:37.608 --> 01:04:39.474
ACTUALLY,
I WAS FOLLOWING THE CHEF.

01:04:39.509 --> 01:04:41.009
I WAS SURPRISED
TO SEE YOU THERE.

01:04:41.044 --> 01:04:42.010
TO BE HONEST,

01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:43.745
IT KIND OF MAKES ME QUESTION
YOUR OBJECTIVITY.

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:46.882
MY OBJECTIVITY IS INTACT,
THANKS.

01:04:46.917 --> 01:04:48.583
I APPRECIATE
YOUR CONCERN.

01:04:48.619 --> 01:04:52.320
THEN LET'S JUST
CHECK THE GPS.

01:04:52.356 --> 01:04:53.588
IT SHOULDN'T BE
A PROBLEM

01:04:53.624 --> 01:04:54.556
UNLESS SHE'S GOT
SOMETHING TO HIDE, RIGHT?

01:05:02.099 --> 01:05:03.999
TAKE THAT AS A YES.

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:07.068
YOU WALKED AWAY
FROM THE SCENE OF A CRIME?

01:05:07.104 --> 01:05:09.671
I DIDN'T WALK.
I DROVE.

01:05:09.706 --> 01:05:11.840
THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME
TO TELL HER ABOUT THE CYANIDE.

01:05:11.875 --> 01:05:12.774
CYANIDE?

01:05:12.809 --> 01:05:13.842
YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:05:13.877 --> 01:05:15.343
I MADE A MISTAKE.

01:05:15.379 --> 01:05:16.711
I'LL CALL THE POLICE.

01:05:16.747 --> 01:05:17.846
NO, YOU WON'T!

01:05:17.881 --> 01:05:19.180
I CAN JUST EXPLAIN
WHAT HAPPENED.

01:05:19.216 --> 01:05:20.248
AND THEN WHAT?

01:05:20.284 --> 01:05:21.216
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO SIT DOWN

01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:24.219
AND HAVE A NICE PIECE
OF CELEBRATION CAKE?

01:05:24.254 --> 01:05:25.954
WHO WOULD WANT TO BLOW UP
PHIL'S PLACE, ANYWAY?

01:05:25.989 --> 01:05:28.256
HE WAS ABOUT TO SHOW ME
TIFFANY'S DEMO.

01:05:28.292 --> 01:05:30.725
I THINK IT MIGHT CONNECT HER
TO LANIE'S MURDER.

01:05:30.761 --> 01:05:31.927
YOU THINK

01:05:31.962 --> 01:05:33.128
SHE KILLED LANIE?

01:05:33.163 --> 01:05:35.096
AND SHE WAS
IN RUDY'S APARTMENT

01:05:35.132 --> 01:05:36.064
THE DAY HE DIED.

01:05:38.302 --> 01:05:39.367
TIFFANY QUIT.

01:05:39.403 --> 01:05:40.302
QUIT?

01:05:40.337 --> 01:05:41.469
I FOUND HER LEAVING
A NOTE ON YOUR DESK

01:05:41.505 --> 01:05:43.405
AFTER THE POLICE
INTERVIEWS.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.407
SHE SAID LIVE TELEVISION
IS TOO STRESSFUL.

01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:46.408
SHE'S GOING BACK

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:47.375
TO PEEBLES FALLS.

01:05:47.411 --> 01:05:48.443
WHEN?

01:05:48.478 --> 01:05:49.544
SOUNDS LIKE TONIGHT.

01:05:49.579 --> 01:05:51.079
SOMEBODY'S IN A HURRY.

01:05:51.114 --> 01:05:51.913
WE HAVE TO STOP HER.

01:05:51.949 --> 01:05:52.781
LEAVE YOUR PHONE.

01:05:52.816 --> 01:05:54.416
THE POLICE HAD IT.

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:55.450
THEY CAN TRACK YOU.

01:05:55.485 --> 01:05:56.885
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:58.787
I THINK TIFFANY KILLED LANIE
AND RUDY.

01:05:58.822 --> 01:06:00.288
UH...
I'LL GO WITH HER.

01:06:02.826 --> 01:06:04.326
DO YOU HAVE A PLAN?

01:06:04.361 --> 01:06:06.428
TO KEEP TIFFANY FROM LEAVING.

01:06:14.838 --> 01:06:16.471
MAYBE WE'RE TOO LATE.

01:06:22.112 --> 01:06:23.278
TIFFANY?

01:06:25.882 --> 01:06:27.449
TIFFANY?

01:06:32.289 --> 01:06:33.421
WHY WOULD SHE RUN?

01:06:33.457 --> 01:06:35.457
SHE WASN'T EVEN
A SUSPECT.

01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:37.325
MAYBE SOMETHING CHANGED.

01:06:38.462 --> 01:06:39.461
BILLIE?

01:06:41.732 --> 01:06:42.764
WELL, YOU'VE
CAUGHT ME.

01:06:42.799 --> 01:06:44.632
CAUGHT YOU?

01:06:44.668 --> 01:06:47.635
I WAS TRYING TO SNEAK AWAY,
BUT I FORGOT MY PHONE.

01:06:47.671 --> 01:06:48.803
HOPE YOU'RE NOT MAD.

01:06:48.839 --> 01:06:50.505
YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE.

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:52.007
THOSE TWO DETECTIVES
INTERVIEWED ME.

01:06:52.042 --> 01:06:53.475
I TOLD THEM EVERYTHING I KNOW.

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:54.809
YOU TOLD THEM
YOU WERE AT RUDY'S APARTMENT?

01:06:55.979 --> 01:06:57.679
I MIGHT HAVE SKIPPED OVER
THAT PART,

01:06:57.714 --> 01:06:59.681
BUT THAT JUST SEEMS LIKE
THE KIND OF FIDDLY DETAIL

01:06:59.716 --> 01:07:00.849
THAT EVERYBODY WOULD GET
CAUGHT UP ON.

01:07:00.884 --> 01:07:03.351
PHIL SAID RUDY HAD A RECORDING
IDENTIFYING THE KILLER.

01:07:03.387 --> 01:07:04.652
- HE DID?
- HE DOES?

01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:06.021
YEAH, WELL...
HE MIGHT.

01:07:06.056 --> 01:07:06.888
I THINK SO.

01:07:06.923 --> 01:07:08.456
PHIL SAID
IT WAS AT RUDY'S APARTMENT.

01:07:08.492 --> 01:07:09.724
IN HIS APARTMENT?

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.359
WE SHOULD TELL THE POLICE.

01:07:11.395 --> 01:07:12.694
PHIL TOLD THE POLICE,

01:07:12.729 --> 01:07:13.528
THE POLICE LOOKED FOR IT.

01:07:13.563 --> 01:07:14.863
THEY COULDN'T FIND IT,

01:07:14.898 --> 01:07:16.131
BUT PHIL SAYS
IT'S PROBABLY THERE.

01:07:16.166 --> 01:07:17.999
SO IF WE WANT
TO CATCH THE KILLER,

01:07:18.035 --> 01:07:19.968
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND
THIS RECORDING ON OUR OWN.

01:07:20.003 --> 01:07:21.302
IN RUDY'S APARTMENT.

01:07:21.338 --> 01:07:22.337
RIGHT.

01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:23.338
HOW DO WE GET IN?

01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:25.040
OH, I KNOW HOW.

01:07:35.419 --> 01:07:36.451
DON'T WORRY.

01:07:36.486 --> 01:07:39.020
RUDY SAID NOBODY EVER USES
THE SERVICE ENTRANCE.

01:07:39.056 --> 01:07:41.489
THE SECURITY CAMERAS BACK HERE
DON'T EVEN WORK.

01:07:48.865 --> 01:07:50.365
WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE DOING HERE?

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.499
PROVING
TIFFANY KNOWS

01:07:51.535 --> 01:07:53.001
HOW TO GET INTO
RUDY'S APARTMENT.

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.339
DID PHIL SAY THAT,
ABOUT THE RECORDING?

01:07:58.375 --> 01:07:59.841
NO, BUT THERE IS A RECORDING.

01:07:59.876 --> 01:08:01.676
IT MAY CONNECT TIFFANY
TO LANIE'S MURDER,

01:08:01.711 --> 01:08:02.510
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
SHE TRIED TO KILL PHIL

01:08:02.546 --> 01:08:04.612
TO KEEP HIM
FROM SHOWING IT TO ME.

01:08:04.648 --> 01:08:05.880
SHE TRIED TO KILL PHIL?

01:08:07.717 --> 01:08:08.817
FOUND IT.

01:08:16.626 --> 01:08:18.859
KIND OF SPOOKY,
ISN'T IT?

01:08:18.895 --> 01:08:21.462
IS THIS HOW YOU GOT IN?
THE DAY RUDY DIED?

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:23.698
WELL, THIS IS HOW
I ALWAYS GOT IN.

01:08:23.733 --> 01:08:24.732
RUDY DIDN'T WANT
GRETCHEN TO KNOW

01:08:24.768 --> 01:08:26.533
WE WERE TALKING.

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:38.645
OKAY, I THINK
WE SHOULD SPLIT UP.

01:08:38.682 --> 01:08:40.582
THAT IS A TERRIBLE IDEA.

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:41.716
WHY DON'T YOU CHECK
THE KITCHEN?

01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:47.287
DO YOU HAVE
YOUR PHONE?

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:48.223
YEAH, WHY?

01:08:48.258 --> 01:08:49.157
TURN ON THE RECORDER.

01:08:49.192 --> 01:08:50.725
TRY TO GET HER TO SAY
SHE WAS HERE THAT DAY.

01:08:53.497 --> 01:08:54.295
WHERE IS RUDY'S
WINE CLOSET?

01:08:54.331 --> 01:08:55.763
UH, DOWN THE HALL,
BY THE BEDROOM.

01:08:55.799 --> 01:08:57.298
OKAY.

01:08:57.334 --> 01:08:58.867
TESTING. TESTING.

01:09:10.514 --> 01:09:12.279
SO, DO YOU...

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:14.182
DID YOU COME HERE
OFTEN?

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:15.917
UH...

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:21.622
BILLIE!
BILLIE!

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:24.826
BILLIE!

01:09:24.861 --> 01:09:26.261
WE JUST FOUND A...

01:09:26.296 --> 01:09:27.795
WHAT IS THAT?

01:09:31.868 --> 01:09:32.834
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:35.170
KIKI?

01:09:36.406 --> 01:09:37.971
SOMEBODY MUST HAVE
FOLLOWED US.

01:09:39.475 --> 01:09:42.042
SHE DIDN'T SAY
WHERE SHE WAS GOING?

01:09:42.078 --> 01:09:43.545
I'M NOT HER BABYSITTER.

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:44.779
LOOK, GUYS, WE CAN
DO THIS HERE,

01:09:44.814 --> 01:09:46.848
OR I CAN TAKE
ALL THREE OF YOU

01:09:46.883 --> 01:09:47.948
DOWN TO THE STATION.

01:09:49.886 --> 01:09:50.818
I THINK WE FOUND HER.

01:10:01.898 --> 01:10:02.664
NOBODY CAME IN.

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:05.033
I'VE BEEN AT THIS DESK
ALL NIGHT.

01:10:06.636 --> 01:10:08.236
I JUST NEED
THE KEYS.

01:10:13.143 --> 01:10:14.409
POLICE!

01:10:33.296 --> 01:10:35.063
COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP.

01:10:36.333 --> 01:10:37.465
KEEP TRYING, KEEP TRYING.

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.167
I CANNOT GET A SIGNAL!

01:10:40.837 --> 01:10:42.537
OH, MY GOD.

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:43.438
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

01:10:43.473 --> 01:10:44.405
WHERE'S KIKI?

01:10:45.442 --> 01:10:46.608
KIKI?

01:10:51.081 --> 01:10:52.380
IS SHE DEAD?

01:11:02.993 --> 01:11:04.826
WHAT HAPPENED?

01:11:04.861 --> 01:11:06.261
I'M CALLING
AN AMBULANCE.

01:11:06.296 --> 01:11:07.028
NO, PLEASE DON'T.

01:11:07.063 --> 01:11:08.463
YOU PROBABLY
HAVE A CONCUSSION.

01:11:08.498 --> 01:11:09.430
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET IN TROUBLE.

01:11:09.466 --> 01:11:10.431
OH, DON'T WORRY.

01:11:10.467 --> 01:11:12.433
SHE'S ALREADY
IN TROUBLE.

01:11:12.469 --> 01:11:13.935
WE DIDN'T BREAK IN.
I HAD A KEY.

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:15.670
WE WERE JUST LOOKING

01:11:15.705 --> 01:11:18.106
FOR THE RECORDING...
OF RUDY'S KILLER.

01:11:18.141 --> 01:11:19.440
TIFFANY FOUND A GUN.

01:11:19.476 --> 01:11:20.742
I SENT HER TO GET BILLIE.

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:22.610
THAT'S THE LAST THING
I REMEMBER.

01:11:22.646 --> 01:11:23.911
HOLD ON.

01:11:33.123 --> 01:11:33.988
IT WAS THERE.

01:11:34.024 --> 01:11:36.858
WHY WOULDN'T THE POLICE
HAVE TAKEN IT

01:11:36.893 --> 01:11:38.192
WHEN THEY SEARCHED
RUDY'S APARTMENT?

01:11:38.228 --> 01:11:40.128
THE GUN WAS REGISTERED TO RUDY.

01:11:40.163 --> 01:11:41.262
PURCHASED LEGALLY,

01:11:41.298 --> 01:11:41.996
AND IT WASN'T RELATED
TO THE CASE.

01:11:42.032 --> 01:11:43.998
CAN YOU FOLLOW ME?

01:11:44.034 --> 01:11:45.566
I NEED TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

01:11:51.574 --> 01:11:52.807
A RECORDING?

01:11:52.842 --> 01:11:53.741
OF RUDY'S MURDERER?

01:11:53.777 --> 01:11:55.877
OKAY, I MIGHT HAVE
BENT THE TRUTH A LITTLE,

01:11:55.912 --> 01:11:57.445
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
I JUST FIGURED OUT

01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:58.513
WHO DID THIS.

01:11:58.548 --> 01:11:59.881
I JUST NEED TWO HOURS.

01:11:59.916 --> 01:12:01.482
JUST GIVE ME TWO HOURS
TO PROVE IT.

01:12:01.518 --> 01:12:03.284
IT'S NOT YOUR JOB TO PROVE IT,

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.119
AND THE MORE YOU TRY,
THE MORE GUILTY YOU LOOK.

01:12:05.155 --> 01:12:06.854
I DIDN'T RANSACK
THIS APARTMENT,

01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:08.389
AND I COULDN'T HAVE
KNOCKED KIKI OUT.

01:12:08.425 --> 01:12:09.891
I WAS LOCKED IN THIS CLOSET.

01:12:09.926 --> 01:12:11.959
WHY DID YOU COME HERE?

01:12:11.995 --> 01:12:13.161
YOU SENT ME A TEXT.

01:12:13.196 --> 01:12:14.629
I DIDN'T SEND YOU A TEXT.

01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:15.963
I LEFT MY PHONE
AT THE RESTAURANT.

01:12:18.735 --> 01:12:20.234
WHY'D YOU GO
TO PHIL NARDI'S HOUSE?

01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:22.070
HE SENT ME A TEXT
TELLING ME TO COME OVER.

01:12:22.105 --> 01:12:23.671
PHIL SAID
YOU SENT HIM A TEXT.

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:26.341
SOMEONE IS TRYING TO FRAME ME,

01:12:26.376 --> 01:12:28.009
AND THEY WERE HERE,
IN THIS APARTMENT.

01:12:28.044 --> 01:12:29.377
I JUST NEED TWO HOURS.

01:12:29.412 --> 01:12:30.812
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.

01:12:33.616 --> 01:12:34.282
LET'S GO.

01:12:34.317 --> 01:12:35.983
WHAT ABOUT THE POLICE OFFICER?

01:12:36.019 --> 01:12:36.684
HE'S LETTING US LEAVE?

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:37.885
WE REALLY
DON'T HAVE TIME

01:12:37.921 --> 01:12:40.221
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

01:12:42.425 --> 01:12:43.191
WHY AREN'T WE PICKING HER UP?

01:12:43.226 --> 01:12:44.926
THE PERSON
WHO KILLED RUDY SLATER

01:12:44.961 --> 01:12:47.495
LOCKED BILLIE AND TIFFANY MOON
IN A WINE CLOSET

01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:48.696
AND TRASHED RUDY'S APARTMENT.

01:12:48.732 --> 01:12:51.165
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.

01:12:51.201 --> 01:12:52.500
IF WE LET BILLIE GO,
THEY'LL FOLLOW HER.

01:12:52.535 --> 01:12:53.468
WHY?

01:12:53.503 --> 01:12:56.371
SAME REASON
THEY TRIED TO KILL PHIL NARDI...

01:12:56.406 --> 01:12:57.472
KEEP HER
FROM FINDING EVIDENCE.

01:12:58.775 --> 01:13:00.508
I HOPE
SHE HASN'T BRAINWASHED YOU

01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:01.843
WITH HER MAGIC FOOD.

01:13:07.117 --> 01:13:08.349
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

01:13:08.385 --> 01:13:09.717
PHIL'S HOUSE.

01:13:09.753 --> 01:13:11.452
I NEED TO SEE
THE RECORDING.

01:13:11.488 --> 01:13:12.553
TIFFANY COULDN'T HAVE
DONE THIS.

01:13:12.589 --> 01:13:14.055
SHE WAS LOCKED
IN A CLOSET.

01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:15.723
MAYBE SHE HAS A HELPER.

01:13:15.759 --> 01:13:17.358
LANCE.

01:13:21.798 --> 01:13:22.730
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

01:13:22.766 --> 01:13:24.532
YEAH,
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

01:13:25.935 --> 01:13:27.769
COME ON. BABY.
DON'T LET ME DOWN.

01:13:28.972 --> 01:13:29.871
WHAT DO I WIN
IF YOU'RE WRONG?

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:45.253
PHIL MIGHT NOT BE
HAPPY TO SEE YOU.

01:13:45.288 --> 01:13:46.621
I DON'T HAVE
A CHOICE.

01:13:48.358 --> 01:13:49.857
WAIT HERE.
I'LL BE BACK.

01:14:06.876 --> 01:14:08.843
I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

01:14:08.878 --> 01:14:10.178
YOU KNOW THE POLICE TOLD ME
TO CALL THEM

01:14:10.213 --> 01:14:11.679
IF YOU TRIED TO CONTACT ME.

01:14:11.714 --> 01:14:13.381
I JUST NEED FIVE MINUTES,
PLEASE.

01:14:15.151 --> 01:14:16.517
LOOK, I KNOW
WHO KILLED LANIE AND RUDY,

01:14:16.553 --> 01:14:18.419
BUT I CAN'T PROVE IT
WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

01:14:21.324 --> 01:14:22.824
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON.

01:14:27.063 --> 01:14:30.598
MAYBE HE FORGAVE HER.

01:14:30.633 --> 01:14:31.599
MAYBE.

01:14:49.352 --> 01:14:51.052
PHIL'S LAPTOP
WAS DESTROYED IN THE FIRE,

01:14:51.087 --> 01:14:53.821
BUT WE CAN ACCESS THE RECORDING
FROM RUDY'S COMPUTER AT WORK.

01:15:01.564 --> 01:15:03.064
KIKI AND I WILL
GO IN THE BACK.

01:15:03.099 --> 01:15:04.332
YOU DISTRACT
THE GUARD.

01:15:04.367 --> 01:15:05.466
I'M NOT A VERY GOOD ACTRESS.

01:15:05.502 --> 01:15:06.834
YOU'LL DO FINE.

01:15:21.751 --> 01:15:23.651
WHY DID YOU
SEND HER AWAY?

01:15:23.686 --> 01:15:26.053
SO WE HAVE TIME
TO LOOK AT THE DEMO.

01:15:26.089 --> 01:15:27.989
BUT WHAT IF
LANCE FOLLOWED US?

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:29.524
I DON'T THINK HE DID.

01:15:44.541 --> 01:15:46.574
I'M GOING IN.
CALL PHIL NARDI.

01:15:46.609 --> 01:15:48.376
MAKE HIM GIVE YOU
NAMES, ALL RIGHT?

01:15:48.411 --> 01:15:50.344
EVERYONE THAT AUDITIONED
FOR THAT CO-HOST JOB...

01:15:53.383 --> 01:15:55.483
PHIL NARDI SENT A VIDEO.

01:15:58.555 --> 01:16:00.555
OKAY, I'M GOING TO NEED
THE PASSWORD TO RUDY'S COMPUTER

01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:02.390
TO GET INTO IT.

01:16:03.393 --> 01:16:04.258
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

01:16:05.895 --> 01:16:07.028
NOT THIS TIME.

01:16:11.501 --> 01:16:12.400
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:16:12.435 --> 01:16:14.235
COULD YOU DROP THE NICE
ACT FOR TWO MINUTES?

01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:15.503
ISN'T THAT WHY
YOU BROUGHT ME HERE?

01:16:15.538 --> 01:16:16.804
TO CONFRONT ME
WITH MY DEMO,

01:16:16.839 --> 01:16:18.339
MAKE ME CONFESS?

01:16:18.374 --> 01:16:19.840
I DIDN'T WANT IT TO BE TRUE.

01:16:19.876 --> 01:16:21.642
WHY?

01:16:21.678 --> 01:16:24.245
IS IT SO HARD TO BELIEVE
THAT I COULD DO LANIE'S JOB?

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.813
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

01:16:25.848 --> 01:16:28.182
I RAN THE TV STATION
AT MY COLLEGE.

01:16:28.217 --> 01:16:29.517
I DID EVERYTHING.

01:16:29.552 --> 01:16:30.284
EDITING, PRODUCING, TALENT...

01:16:32.021 --> 01:16:32.853
WHEN RUDY MET ME,

01:16:32.889 --> 01:16:35.189
HE SAID
I WAS EVEN BETTER THAN LANIE

01:16:35.224 --> 01:16:36.324
BECAUSE I'M SMART.

01:16:36.359 --> 01:16:38.192
SO I CAME HERE,

01:16:38.227 --> 01:16:41.662
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN HE SAW MY DEMO?

01:16:41.698 --> 01:16:42.730
HE LAUGHED.

01:16:42.765 --> 01:16:44.665
HE SAID
IF I WANTED LANIE'S JOB,

01:16:44.701 --> 01:16:46.701
I WOULD HAVE
TO BUY MY OWN NETWORK.

01:16:46.736 --> 01:16:48.035
LANIE WOULD
NEVER RETIRE.

01:16:48.071 --> 01:16:48.836
SO YOU POISONED HER.

01:16:48.871 --> 01:16:50.938
THAT RAT POISON
WAS 60 YEARS OLD.

01:16:50.974 --> 01:16:51.906
I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD WORK.

01:16:51.941 --> 01:16:53.040
WHERE DID YOU GET IT?

01:16:53.076 --> 01:16:55.876
I FOUND IT IN THE BARN
WHEN I WENT HOME OVER CHRISTMAS.

01:16:55.912 --> 01:16:58.179
KIKI, YOU'RE SO TALENTED.

01:16:58.214 --> 01:17:00.381
YOU COULD HAVE SUCCEEDED
IN SO MANY OTHER WAYS.

01:17:00.416 --> 01:17:01.349
THAT'S EASY
FOR YOU TO SAY.

01:17:01.384 --> 01:17:03.384
YOU WERE RUDY'S PET.

01:17:03.419 --> 01:17:05.286
HE GAVE YOU EVERYTHING,

01:17:05.321 --> 01:17:06.420
AND HE KEPT GIVING YOU MORE,

01:17:06.456 --> 01:17:07.955
EVEN THOUGH
YOU DIDN'T DESERVE IT.

01:17:07.991 --> 01:17:10.291
SO YOU FRAMED ME
BECAUSE YOU WERE ANGRY.

01:17:10.326 --> 01:17:13.127
I WASN'T ANGRY.
YOU JUST MADE IT SO EASY.

01:17:13.162 --> 01:17:14.395
"KIKI, CAN YOU CHECK
MY SCHEDULE?

01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:16.330
SEND FLOWERS
TO THAT GUEST?

01:17:16.366 --> 01:17:18.332
FIND MY CAR KEYS?"

01:17:18.368 --> 01:17:19.600
SO THAT'S HOW YOU GOT
INTO THE RESTAURANT,

01:17:19.636 --> 01:17:21.936
PLANTED THE CAKE
AND THE RAT POISON.

01:17:21.971 --> 01:17:22.770
THAT'S HOW I DID IT ALL.

01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:24.472
YOU WERE SO HELPFUL.

01:17:24.507 --> 01:17:26.807
KEYS, PASSWORDS,
CREDIT CARDS...

01:17:26.843 --> 01:17:28.342
I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS.

01:17:28.378 --> 01:17:31.412
YOU SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION.

01:17:31.447 --> 01:17:33.781
PEOPLE IN TELEVISION
DON'T HAVE FRIENDS.

01:17:33.816 --> 01:17:35.650
<i>I'M GOING
TO READ THE CLOSE OF THE SHOW,</i>

01:17:35.685 --> 01:17:37.084
<i>WHERE WE WISH EVERYONE
A GREAT DAY</i>

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:37.952
<i>AND WELCOME THEM</i>

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:39.754
<i>TO WAKE UP WITH US
AGAIN TOMORROW.</i>

01:17:39.789 --> 01:17:41.989
<i>UH, WELL, THAT'S...
THAT'S LANIE'S PART</i>

01:17:42.025 --> 01:17:44.258
<i>SO YOU SHOULD READ ONE
YOU COULD GET.</i>

01:17:44.293 --> 01:17:45.926
<i>YOU DON'T THINK
I CAN DO LANIE'S JOB?</i>

01:17:45.962 --> 01:17:46.927
<i> NO, I'M JUST SAYING</i>

01:17:46.963 --> 01:17:48.996
<i>THAT SHE'S BEEN HERE
FOR, LIKE, 10 YEARS,</i>

01:17:49.032 --> 01:17:50.331
<i>SO SHE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.</i>

01:17:50.366 --> 01:17:51.966
<i>OH...</i>

01:17:52.001 --> 01:17:54.635
<i>WELL, I DON'T THINK
SHE'LL BE AROUND MUCH LONGER,</i>

01:17:54.671 --> 01:17:56.604
<i>AND RUDY PROMISED
THE JOB TO ME.</i>

01:17:56.639 --> 01:17:58.506
THERE'S OUR MYSTERY HOST.

01:18:17.994 --> 01:18:19.393
THAT'S ONE WAY.

01:18:19.429 --> 01:18:21.228
THE POLICE
FOLLOWED US.

01:18:21.264 --> 01:18:22.730
IF YOU SHOOT ME,
THEY'LL FIND YOU.

01:18:22.765 --> 01:18:24.999
I'LL TELL THEM
YOU SHOT YOURSELF...

01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:26.000
OUT OF GUILT.

01:18:26.035 --> 01:18:27.368
I TRIED TO STOP YOU.

01:18:27.403 --> 01:18:29.003
TRAGICALLY, I FAILED.

01:18:29.038 --> 01:18:31.138
THEY'LL NEVER BELIEVE YOU,

01:18:31.174 --> 01:18:32.406
NOT AFTER THEY SEE THAT DEMO.

01:18:32.442 --> 01:18:34.141
OH, THAT DEMO
DOESN'T PROVE A THING!

01:18:34.177 --> 01:18:35.409
THAT'S WHAT I SAID TO RUDY.

01:18:35.445 --> 01:18:37.144
"SAYING
SOMEONE MIGHT LEAVE THE SHOW

01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:38.379
DOESN'T MAKE YOU A MURDERER."

01:18:38.414 --> 01:18:40.214
BUT SAYING
YOU KILLED THEM DOES.

01:18:42.185 --> 01:18:43.684
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:44.719
SHOOT ME, TOO?

01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:55.830
COME ON!

01:18:58.768 --> 01:18:59.934
I'LL TAKE THE STUDIO.

01:18:59.969 --> 01:19:00.735
OKAY.

01:19:21.724 --> 01:19:23.257
MMPH!

01:19:23.292 --> 01:19:25.159
SHH...

01:19:37.607 --> 01:19:39.173
I WOULDN'T RUN.

01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:43.010
COULD MAKE GREAT TV.

01:19:50.186 --> 01:19:52.086
I'M SORRY.

01:19:57.927 --> 01:19:58.893
GO.

01:20:08.004 --> 01:20:10.070
IT TOOK A WHILE
TO GET US HERE,

01:20:10.106 --> 01:20:12.106
BUT I'M SO GLAD
WE'RE ALL AT THE SAME TABLE.

01:20:13.543 --> 01:20:16.477
YOU KNOW,
A VERY WISE MAN ONCE SAID,

01:20:16.512 --> 01:20:18.245
WHEN YOU BREAK BREAD
WITH SOMEONE,

01:20:18.281 --> 01:20:19.413
YOU MAKE THEM YOUR FRIEND.

01:20:21.517 --> 01:20:23.517
TO RUDY,
FOR MAKING US FRIENDS.

01:20:23.553 --> 01:20:24.952
TO RUDY.

01:20:27.156 --> 01:20:28.155
AND TO BILLIE.

01:20:29.458 --> 01:20:30.624
WELCOME BACK.

01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:32.092
OH, THANK YOU.

01:20:32.128 --> 01:20:33.160
AND I'M GLAD

01:20:33.196 --> 01:20:35.162
WE TALKED TIFFANY
INTO STAYING.

01:20:37.667 --> 01:20:39.066
AND BILLIE...
UM...

01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:43.103
RUDY MEANT A LOT TO ME,

01:20:43.139 --> 01:20:45.539
AND WHEN I THOUGHT THAT YOU...

01:20:45.575 --> 01:20:47.474
WELL, LOOK, WHAT I'M
TRYING TO SAY IS...

01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:50.611
I SHOULDN'T HAVE FIRED YOU.
I'M SORRY.

01:20:50.646 --> 01:20:53.214
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

01:20:54.383 --> 01:20:55.282
OKAY,
NO MORE TALKING.

01:20:55.318 --> 01:20:56.650
LET'S EAT.

01:20:58.087 --> 01:20:59.587
THIS SMELLS AMAZING.

01:21:00.823 --> 01:21:02.323
AH, DELICIOUS.

01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:04.892
OH, MAN, THIS IS
FANTASTIC.

01:21:04.927 --> 01:21:06.794
WHAT IS THIS?

01:21:06.829 --> 01:21:08.329
IT'S TURNIP.
MWAH!

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:20.307
EXCUSE ME.

01:21:32.021 --> 01:21:33.254
HEY.

01:21:33.289 --> 01:21:35.356
THANKS FOR THE INVITE.

01:21:35.391 --> 01:21:37.858
WHY DON'T YOU COME INSIDE?

01:21:37.894 --> 01:21:39.393
THE LAST TIME I SAW

01:21:39.428 --> 01:21:40.895
YOUR AUNT CASSANDRA
AND MAURICE,

01:21:40.930 --> 01:21:43.230
THEY WERE
PRETTY UPSET.

01:21:43.266 --> 01:21:45.933
WELL, YOU DID TRY
TO ARREST ME.

01:21:45.968 --> 01:21:47.234
I THINK I SHOULD
GET A FEW POINTS

01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:48.269
FOR LETTING YOU
WALK AWAY

01:21:48.304 --> 01:21:50.371
FROM RUDY'S APARTMENT.

01:21:50.406 --> 01:21:52.206
AND FOR EXPLAINING
THAT CAN OF CYANIDE

01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:54.074
THAT WAS IN MAURICE'S CAR

01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:56.510
TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

01:21:58.748 --> 01:22:01.448
HOW DID YOU KNOW
IT WAS KIKI?

01:22:01.484 --> 01:22:02.583
WHEN WE WERE
AT RUDY'S APARTMENT,

01:22:02.618 --> 01:22:05.019
I ASKED WHERE RUDY'S
WINE CLOSET WAS,

01:22:05.054 --> 01:22:06.553
AND SHE TOLD ME,

01:22:06.589 --> 01:22:07.788
WITHOUT ASKING WHY,

01:22:07.823 --> 01:22:09.123
WHICH IS STRANGE,

01:22:09.158 --> 01:22:10.958
GIVEN ALL THE QUESTIONS
SHE USUALLY ASKS.

01:22:10.993 --> 01:22:13.560
IT WAS AS IF
SHE ALREADY KNEW,

01:22:13.596 --> 01:22:14.628
AND THEN WE GOT LOCKED IN,

01:22:14.664 --> 01:22:17.197
AND THEN I STARTED THINKING
ABOUT OCCAM'S RAZOR,

01:22:17.233 --> 01:22:18.599
THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATION.

01:22:20.102 --> 01:22:22.603
WHO HAD ACCESS
TO ALL THAT INFORMATION...

01:22:22.638 --> 01:22:25.539
CREDIT CARDS, EMAILS,
KEYS, SCHEDULES?

01:22:25.574 --> 01:22:26.540
KIKI.

01:22:26.575 --> 01:22:27.741
YEAH.

01:22:27.777 --> 01:22:31.312
SHE'S SMART...
JUST LIKE RUDY SAID...

01:22:31.347 --> 01:22:33.614
AND SHE MADE HERSELF
INDISPENSABLE.

01:22:33.649 --> 01:22:35.149
SHE HAD THE EXPERTISE
TO HACK YOUR PHONE

01:22:35.184 --> 01:22:37.985
AND SEND SPOOF TEXTS.

01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:40.754
OCCAM'S RAZOR.

01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:41.989
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT
PUTS ANOTHER POINT

01:22:42.024 --> 01:22:45.125
IN MY FAVOR...

01:22:45.161 --> 01:22:47.061
WHICH MEANS,
TECHNICALLY,

01:22:47.096 --> 01:22:49.930
I GET A FRESH START.

01:22:49.966 --> 01:22:51.999
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY.

01:22:52.034 --> 01:22:54.268
A GOOD DESSERT MAKES
ANYTHING POSSIBLE.

01:22:54.303 --> 01:22:55.269
YOU WANT
TO COME IN

01:22:55.304 --> 01:22:57.838
FOR SOME CELEBRATION CAKE?

01:22:57.873 --> 01:22:58.872
CAKE?

01:23:02.378 --> 01:23:04.545
WHAT ARE WE CELEBRATING?

01:23:06.048 --> 01:23:07.114
TEAMWORK.

01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:08.816
I LIKE IT.

01:23:08.851 --> 01:23:10.417
SO DO I.

01:23:10.453 --> 01:23:12.386
COME ON.
