WEBVTT

00:06.417 --> 00:07.250
Hey, Rudy.

00:11.834 --> 00:12.875
What are you doing?

00:12.959 --> 00:16.041
Oh, just cutting expenses
by timing everyone's shower.

00:16.125 --> 00:18.542
Jack has exactly five seconds
of hot water left.

00:19.125 --> 00:21.458
Three, two, and...

00:25.375 --> 00:27.417
I love the sound of saving money.

00:29.709 --> 00:31.333
Again with the hot water, Rudy?

00:31.417 --> 00:33.750
I know it costs more to run this place
than you expected,

00:33.834 --> 00:36.458
but these temperature fluctuations
are giving me split ends.

00:38.500 --> 00:41.125
Do you want to live in a world
where I have split ends?

00:49.458 --> 00:50.792
Oh, yo, Milton.

00:50.875 --> 00:53.041
Your ex-girlfriend Julie's
out in the courtyard.

00:54.875 --> 00:56.417
You gonna try and win her back again?

00:56.500 --> 00:57.875
Uh, yeah.

00:58.834 --> 01:01.208
I'm gonna show her the new Milton

01:01.291 --> 01:02.500
is a man.

01:03.834 --> 01:06.792
Does the new man Milton
know he has toilet paper on his shoe?

01:06.875 --> 01:08.166
He does now.

01:11.542 --> 01:13.750
Milton, you look so--

01:13.834 --> 01:15.208
Cool? Yeah.

01:15.291 --> 01:17.709
Daddy made some changes.

01:20.041 --> 01:21.041
Friday night,

01:21.125 --> 01:22.917
You and me...

01:23.750 --> 01:24.750
Are going out.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.667
And you're gonna get all up in...

01:26.750 --> 01:29.000
Aah, this.

01:30.417 --> 01:32.083
This is my new boyfriend Dan.

01:33.291 --> 01:34.458
Oh.

01:35.667 --> 01:36.875
Nice to meet you.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.458
Taking Julie to Matt Dorsey's
Senior party on Friday night.

01:42.542 --> 01:44.166
Dude, that's the biggest
party of the year.

01:44.250 --> 01:46.625
And we're going in Dan's car.

01:46.709 --> 01:48.542
Because he's a man.

01:48.625 --> 01:50.834
Who drives a car.

01:50.917 --> 01:52.208
Unfortunately for you,

01:52.291 --> 01:54.667
I don't date boys anymore.

01:56.041 --> 01:57.041
Well...

01:57.125 --> 01:58.375
As a matter of fact,

01:58.458 --> 02:01.375
Jerry and I are going to that party

02:01.458 --> 02:02.917
in a car.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.333
Hmm?

02:04.959 --> 02:06.458
Oh, please.

02:06.542 --> 02:07.917
You may have a license,

02:08.000 --> 02:09.792
but you don't have anything to drive.

02:13.875 --> 02:15.500
Jerry, can you get us an automobile?

02:16.375 --> 02:18.000
Dude, I can't even get us a car.

02:19.750 --> 02:22.917

03:00.250 --> 03:02.083
Hey, Nurse Kippler,

03:02.166 --> 03:03.959
rocking the blue station wagon.

03:04.041 --> 03:05.667
Hey, Matt's having a party Friday night

03:05.750 --> 03:07.125
and Milton and I would love to borrow--

03:07.208 --> 03:09.291
You're the nurse.
You're supposed to help people.

03:11.417 --> 03:13.458
Whoa. Check out that ride.

03:18.625 --> 03:20.625
Oh, that's my dad. I forgot my lunch.

03:22.792 --> 03:23.834
Thanks, Dad.

03:26.125 --> 03:27.667
Jerry, I think we should just give up.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.166
We're never gonna find a car.

03:29.291 --> 03:31.333
Dude, let's take your dad's car
to the party.

03:31.375 --> 03:33.417
Jerry, he only lets me
drive it if he's in--

03:33.500 --> 03:35.208
Ohh.

03:36.041 --> 03:38.709
You-- you are a bad influence,

03:39.375 --> 03:41.417
but all right.
We'll take my dad to the party.

03:41.875 --> 03:43.834
What? No. No, no, no.

03:43.917 --> 03:45.458
We borrow the car.

03:45.542 --> 03:47.291
Just without him in it.

03:47.375 --> 03:48.291
Are you kidding?

03:48.375 --> 03:49.583
If anything happened to that car,

03:49.667 --> 03:51.208
I'd be grounded for the rest of my life.

03:52.208 --> 03:53.750
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

03:55.458 --> 03:57.500
Look, we'll have it back
before he even knows it's gone.

03:57.583 --> 03:59.959
-
- What kind of a boy do you think I am?

04:00.041 --> 04:02.000
The kind of boy who wants
his girl to know he's a man.

04:02.083 --> 04:03.291
I'll pick you up at 6:00.

04:04.125 --> 04:06.375
All right. Whoo!

04:08.166 --> 04:09.583
Come on. Hit the dummy.

04:09.667 --> 04:12.375
Here at the Warrior Academy, we are men.

04:12.458 --> 04:14.667
So let me hear you
unleash your inner beast!

04:15.375 --> 04:17.625
Flap your arms, flap your wings,

04:17.709 --> 04:19.625
float like a butterfly.

04:19.709 --> 04:21.500
Flap your arms, flap your wings,

04:21.583 --> 04:23.750
float like a butterfly.

04:25.875 --> 04:27.166
No, no, guys.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.834
Come on, you can't just take your beast
and go home.

04:31.125 --> 04:32.917
Oh, good job, girls.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.917
And now let's return
to our cooldown cocoons.

04:38.083 --> 04:40.000
Ow! What are you doing, Jack?

04:40.083 --> 04:42.917
You don't just grab a guy mid-cocoon.

04:44.583 --> 04:46.375
What are you doing to our dojo?

04:46.458 --> 04:47.792
What? We needed more money,

04:47.875 --> 04:49.625
so I found a new type of customer.

04:49.709 --> 04:51.583
You've turned the dojo into a mom gym.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.458
What? That's not true.

04:54.542 --> 04:56.166
Lois is a grandmother,

04:56.250 --> 04:57.667
and Charlene wants kids

04:57.750 --> 04:59.834
but her husband wants to wait
so they can travel.

04:59.917 --> 05:01.000
Rudy!

05:01.792 --> 05:02.875
What has happened to you?

05:02.959 --> 05:04.291
What has happened to you?

05:05.417 --> 05:08.500
You used to appreciate
all the little things that I do.

05:08.583 --> 05:10.458
Did you even notice the lavender sachet

05:10.542 --> 05:11.959
I hung up in the bo staff closet?

05:13.458 --> 05:15.041
Jack, you have got to help me.

05:17.166 --> 05:18.834
This is the Warrior Academy.

05:18.917 --> 05:21.083
This place should be filled with warriors.

05:21.166 --> 05:23.458
You're right.
I am the sensei of the Warrior Academy

05:23.542 --> 05:25.291
and it is high time that I man up.

05:25.375 --> 05:26.417
-
- Ooh!

05:26.500 --> 05:27.917
My cranberry scones are ready.

05:29.834 --> 05:32.417
I mean, my man-berry scones are ready.

05:36.333 --> 05:38.333
<i>♪ Hey, come on ♪</i>

05:38.375 --> 05:40.166
<i>♪ And no matter how much
I chop and punch ♪</i>

05:40.250 --> 05:43.000
<i>♪ It's not as cool as
Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

05:47.542 --> 05:49.208
Yo, what are we doing?
Why are we stopping?

05:49.959 --> 05:53.125
So I can squeegee off that mosquito
that went splat on the windshield.

05:53.208 --> 05:54.667
Dude, you drive two miles an hour.

05:54.750 --> 05:56.250
That mosquito didn't go splat.

05:56.375 --> 05:58.625
He landed on the windshield
and died of boredom.

05:59.917 --> 06:01.625
Look, I have to keep this car clean.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.208
The only reason my dad let me borrow it

06:03.291 --> 06:05.250
is because I told him
I was going to the library.

06:05.333 --> 06:06.417
Oh, yeah.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.166
I told my mom
I was going to the library too.

06:09.208 --> 06:10.333
You think she bought that?

06:11.333 --> 06:13.750
I don't know.
She was still laughing when I left.

06:18.500 --> 06:19.542
So, gentlemen,

06:19.625 --> 06:22.041
welcome to the Wasabi Warrior Academy.

06:22.125 --> 06:25.125
This is a wall to wall
combat training center.

06:26.542 --> 06:28.583
You can smell the sweat in the air.

06:29.458 --> 06:30.834
It kind of smells like biscuits.

06:30.917 --> 06:32.250
They're called scones.

06:33.834 --> 06:35.709
Why would we leave Muscle Universe

06:35.792 --> 06:37.041
to come to this gym?

06:37.125 --> 06:39.458
I've never even heard of
anybody that works out here.

06:41.375 --> 06:42.542
Oh, really?

06:43.333 --> 06:44.792
I suppose you've never heard of...

06:45.667 --> 06:48.500
Arnold Schwarzenrudy.

06:49.709 --> 06:50.625
Who's he?

06:50.709 --> 06:52.417
Yeah, Rudy. Who's he?

07:15.709 --> 07:18.041
<i>Ja</i> , I'm Rudy's cousin,

07:18.125 --> 07:19.750
Arnold Schwarzenrudy.

07:20.250 --> 07:23.041
Look at me. I'm so very huge.

07:25.542 --> 07:27.291
He's the strongest man I've ever known.

07:27.375 --> 07:29.417
I once saw him bench press
a thousand pounds

07:29.500 --> 07:30.834
while he was bench pressing a man

07:30.917 --> 07:32.875
who was bench pressing a thousand pounds.

07:35.083 --> 07:37.583
<i>Ja</i> , I don't think
this is the place for you.

07:37.667 --> 07:39.875
This is where real men work out.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.000
Not a scrawny little wimpy man like you.

07:42.917 --> 07:44.959
Ha! I think I'm in pretty good shape.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.166
That's a good one!

07:48.542 --> 07:49.709
<i>Ja.</i>

07:49.792 --> 07:52.250
Oh, you call those obliques?

07:52.291 --> 07:54.083
I call them "oh, please."

07:55.166 --> 07:57.083
You call those abs?

07:57.166 --> 07:59.000
I call them "flabs."

08:00.000 --> 08:02.166
You call those triceps?

08:02.250 --> 08:03.834
I call them...

08:03.917 --> 08:05.834
"Not good triceps."

08:07.500 --> 08:08.542
Wow, you're right.

08:09.417 --> 08:11.959
Compared to you, I'm a mess.

08:12.041 --> 08:14.041
Boys, we're training here.

08:15.709 --> 08:16.917
Great. Welcome.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.792
Is what I would be saying

08:22.875 --> 08:25.125
if your squeezing my hand actually hurt,

08:25.208 --> 08:26.291
but it doesn't.

08:26.417 --> 08:27.959
Because I'm huge.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.667
Aah! No. No more handshakes.

08:30.750 --> 08:32.375
Let's just fist bump.

08:43.750 --> 08:46.709
That toilet was absolutely heinous.

08:46.792 --> 08:48.750
It smelled like it had been
used by a hundred truckers

08:48.834 --> 08:50.959
with serious digestive problems.

08:51.709 --> 08:52.625
Huh.

08:52.709 --> 08:54.083
Smelled fine when I went in.

08:58.959 --> 09:00.250
Dude?

09:01.917 --> 09:03.500
Isn't this where you parked the car?

09:04.709 --> 09:06.333
This is exactly where I park--

09:08.250 --> 09:10.959
Oh, my dad's car was stolen.

09:12.417 --> 09:15.500
No!

09:16.291 --> 09:18.500
Look at me. Look, I know
this looks bad, okay?

09:18.583 --> 09:20.000
But you need to calm down.

09:22.959 --> 09:24.333
Oh, no.

09:24.417 --> 09:26.458
My cherry-berry lip balm was in the car.

09:28.041 --> 09:30.375
No!

09:35.333 --> 09:37.166
Well, I guess there's nothing left to do

09:37.250 --> 09:38.667
but call my dad and tell him

09:38.750 --> 09:40.000
I never went to the library

09:40.083 --> 09:41.583
and that I got his car stolen.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.375
I mean, yeah. I guess
that's the right thing to do, right?

09:45.458 --> 09:47.709
- Yeah.
- Have him drive out here and pick us up.

09:47.792 --> 09:49.458
And because you two
will have a lot to talk about,

09:49.542 --> 09:51.500
you can go ahead and drop me
off at Matt Dorsey's party.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.542
Then a couple hours later
once you guys have cooled down,

09:54.625 --> 09:56.959
you know, you can swing by, pick me up
somewhere around elevenish.

09:57.041 --> 09:57.875
- Jerry.
- Okay.

09:57.959 --> 09:59.917
- You're not going to the party.
- Right, right.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.208
Gah! I left my phone in the car.

10:05.291 --> 10:06.834
Could this get any worse?

10:07.125 --> 10:09.041
Oh, yeah, without a car,
you can't get Julie back.

10:10.333 --> 10:11.458
Thanks, Jerry.

10:11.542 --> 10:12.709
Now give me your phone.

10:12.792 --> 10:14.667
Okay, here you go.

10:16.291 --> 10:19.041
Wait, you have a GPS locator app too.

10:19.125 --> 10:21.000
- Yeah.
- We can use this to track my phone

10:21.083 --> 10:22.875
- and find the car.
- Oh, sweet.

10:22.959 --> 10:24.709
Oh, it says it's four miles from here

10:24.792 --> 10:27.041
at Fairmont Avenue and Clark Street.

10:27.125 --> 10:28.625
What are you guys doing here?

10:28.709 --> 10:32.125
Yeah. Gas stations
are for people who have cars.

10:32.667 --> 10:35.125
We had a car. It got stolen from us.

10:35.208 --> 10:36.291
Yeah.

10:36.375 --> 10:38.375
Hey, kind of like
you stole Julie from Milton.

10:38.792 --> 10:41.000
Yeah, I did. Up top!

10:41.083 --> 10:42.667
Oh, yeah!

10:43.417 --> 10:44.709
Thanks for that, Jerry.

10:45.709 --> 10:48.083
Look, we need a ride
so we can get my car back.

10:48.166 --> 10:49.834
I'm not giving you losers a ride.

10:51.583 --> 10:55.333
Listen to me, you king-sized
piece of arm candy.

10:55.417 --> 10:56.959
You are going to get in that car

10:57.041 --> 10:58.917
and drive us over to Fairmont and Clark.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.792
But first, I'm gonna go inside

11:00.875 --> 11:02.000
and get myself a drink!

11:02.083 --> 11:03.500
Maybe some corn doodlers.

11:03.583 --> 11:05.834
Does anybody else want anything?

11:09.041 --> 11:10.083
Good!

11:20.291 --> 11:23.083
Dude, you've been hogging
this bench for an hour.

11:23.166 --> 11:25.125
You're gonna have to let someone else
use the weights.

11:25.208 --> 11:27.125
You gotta find something else to lift.

11:28.083 --> 11:29.625
No problem.

11:36.625 --> 11:38.417
Thanks for giving us a second chance.

11:38.500 --> 11:40.083
Now you'll see the Warrior Academy

11:40.166 --> 11:41.166
for what it really is.

11:46.917 --> 11:48.250
Rudy, what is going on?

11:48.333 --> 11:50.125
These guys are taking over, Jack.

11:50.208 --> 11:52.291
These meatheads are
multiplying like rabbits.

11:52.375 --> 11:54.667
Big, loud, grunting, oily rabbits.

11:55.583 --> 11:56.500
Hey, Rudy.

11:56.583 --> 11:57.917
Rack this for me.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.709
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

12:02.166 --> 12:03.291
Aah.

12:06.291 --> 12:07.834
Hey, big guy.

12:08.291 --> 12:09.709
Can I talk to you for a minute?

12:10.625 --> 12:13.125
Look, this workout facility
is for everybody.

12:13.208 --> 12:14.458
And that's why...

12:14.542 --> 12:16.166
We have this code of conduct on the wall.

12:16.250 --> 12:18.542
Oh, I'm sorry, Jack.

12:18.625 --> 12:20.000
I didn't see it.

12:20.083 --> 12:21.792
Oh, it's perfectly understandable.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.041
It's an easy thing to miss.

12:41.917 --> 12:43.458
We gotta strip this baby fast.

12:43.542 --> 12:45.834
The boss is sending a guy named Nicky
over for the parts.

12:47.166 --> 12:48.500
I've heard of these places.

12:48.583 --> 12:50.542
They break down your car into parts.

12:50.625 --> 12:51.959
They're called chop shops.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.375
Hey, that's kind of fun to say.

12:56.458 --> 12:58.458
Chop shop. Chop shop. Chop shop.

12:58.542 --> 13:00.000
Would you please stop saying "chop shop"?

13:01.333 --> 13:03.166
Milton, what's the plan?

13:07.792 --> 13:09.709
Well, maybe Nicky should answer that.

13:10.583 --> 13:12.291
Hey, I'm Nicky.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.500
I'm the guy your boss
sent over to pick up the car.

13:15.750 --> 13:17.250
We haven't even broken it down yet.

13:17.333 --> 13:18.375
No, it's okay.

13:18.458 --> 13:20.125
He told me to come on down to the shop

13:20.208 --> 13:21.291
and stop the chop...

13:22.417 --> 13:23.375
Pop.

13:26.875 --> 13:28.750
See, he's giving this car to his wife

13:28.834 --> 13:30.375
to surprise her for her birthday.

13:30.458 --> 13:31.875
The boss doesn't have a wife.

13:33.625 --> 13:35.500
That's what makes it a surprise.

13:36.041 --> 13:37.250
Ooh.

13:38.875 --> 13:40.000
We just lifted this one.

13:40.083 --> 13:41.959
So you're gonna have to
hot wire it to get it started.

13:42.041 --> 13:43.083
Yeah.

13:44.917 --> 13:46.166
Yeah.

13:46.250 --> 13:47.375
That's what I'll do.

13:48.917 --> 13:50.417
The old hot wire.

13:58.125 --> 13:59.834
I'm just gonna pop the hood.

14:04.959 --> 14:07.458
Now I'm going to pop the hood.

14:10.458 --> 14:11.709
Yo, Milton. You okay?

14:13.083 --> 14:14.834
- Jerry!
- Oh, sorry.

14:14.917 --> 14:16.083
Yo, Nicky, you all right?

14:16.917 --> 14:18.166
You're not Nicky.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.250
Guys.

14:30.291 --> 14:31.417
No, not the car!

14:31.500 --> 14:32.750
Aw, man.

14:44.917 --> 14:46.625
Dan, help me!

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Whoa!

15:04.417 --> 15:05.291
Jerry,

15:06.000 --> 15:07.208
call the cops.

15:08.250 --> 15:09.125
On it.

15:10.917 --> 15:14.500
Milton, I've never seen
this manly side of you before.

15:15.583 --> 15:17.542
Well, it's-- it's always been here.

15:18.166 --> 15:20.250
You just couldn't see it
'cause I didn't have a car.

15:21.500 --> 15:22.917
I was really wrong about you.

15:23.750 --> 15:24.917
You do have a car.

15:26.500 --> 15:29.500
You think that we could
go to that party together?

15:37.166 --> 15:38.500
Unfortunately for you,

15:39.959 --> 15:41.417
I don't date girls anymore.

15:45.041 --> 15:47.125
I mean, I date women.

15:48.625 --> 15:49.625
Is it over?

15:53.417 --> 15:54.458
There's your date.

15:55.625 --> 15:56.792
You should go.

16:01.959 --> 16:04.375
Yo, we got the car back. We should go.

16:04.750 --> 16:05.792
No.

16:06.959 --> 16:09.250
We didn't come this far just to go home.

16:10.542 --> 16:12.875
We're gonna go to that party,
and you know what?

16:13.709 --> 16:15.166
We're gonna look cool doing it.

16:15.250 --> 16:16.959
- All right.
- Yeah.

16:17.792 --> 16:19.291
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

16:19.417 --> 16:20.875
Uh, excuse me?

16:20.959 --> 16:22.875
Who washed their dog in the shower?

16:23.834 --> 16:25.542
No, man. That's all me.

16:25.625 --> 16:29.125
Had to shave the pecs
and pits for a pose-off.

16:31.041 --> 16:33.875
He made me get the hard to reach places.

16:36.458 --> 16:38.333
Rudy, we can't live like this anymore.

16:38.417 --> 16:39.709
They won't listen to us.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.458
There is one person they might listen to.

16:43.917 --> 16:45.375
All right, all right.

16:45.458 --> 16:47.041
Listen up, apes.

16:49.041 --> 16:50.208
<i>Ja.</i>

16:50.917 --> 16:53.542
It takes a big man to lift 700 pounds.

16:54.166 --> 16:55.834
But it takes an even bigger man

16:55.917 --> 16:57.166
to clean up after himself

16:57.250 --> 16:58.792
and show people respect.

16:59.250 --> 17:01.667
Look, this is our gym now.

17:01.750 --> 17:03.166
We don't have to listen to you,

17:03.250 --> 17:05.041
your cousin, or anybody else.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.166
Oh, <i>ja</i> ?

17:06.250 --> 17:08.375
Well maybe you'll listen to my muscles.

17:10.834 --> 17:12.542
-
- Ohh.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.291
I just popped a glute.
It's perfectly normal.

17:17.917 --> 17:18.959
Rudy, what is happening?

17:19.041 --> 17:20.125
I sprung a leak.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.792
Uh, you're getting smaller, dude.

17:24.875 --> 17:26.375
No. No, I'm not.

17:31.125 --> 17:32.458
Now you're getting bigger.

17:32.542 --> 17:34.750
No. Just pumping up.

17:34.834 --> 17:36.959
Must I remind you I'm huge?

17:42.291 --> 17:44.166
Rudy, I broke the handle.

17:44.250 --> 17:45.291
I can't turn it off.

17:46.959 --> 17:48.959
Ah. Ah.

17:51.959 --> 17:53.583
I'm getting too huge!

17:58.125 --> 18:00.417
Hey, it's just that guy, Rudy.

18:02.542 --> 18:03.709
Listen, little man.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.250
We're gonna do what we want.

18:05.333 --> 18:06.792
Hey, take your hands off of him.

18:07.583 --> 18:09.000
What are you gonna do?

18:14.417 --> 18:17.083
Oh, no! What are you crazy or something?

18:17.166 --> 18:19.458
Are you gonna play nice
and start acting like a human being?

18:19.542 --> 18:20.750
Yes! Yes!

18:26.208 --> 18:27.583
What's wrong with you, man?

18:28.250 --> 18:29.917
You hurt my arm,

18:30.542 --> 18:32.083
and my feelings.

18:34.041 --> 18:35.583
How did you learn to do that?

18:35.667 --> 18:37.041
I study martial arts.

18:37.125 --> 18:40.250
And the first thing you learn
is what's more important than strength

18:40.333 --> 18:41.959
is respect for other people.

18:42.875 --> 18:44.834
<i>Ja</i> , the boy's right.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.208
Sorry, I was still in character.

18:50.250 --> 18:51.917
Look, if you guys want to stay here,

18:52.000 --> 18:53.291
you're gonna have to follow the rules.

18:54.375 --> 18:56.709
This place is more to you guys
than a gym, isn't it?

18:56.792 --> 18:57.750
Yeah.

18:58.417 --> 18:59.458
It's our home.

19:02.125 --> 19:04.375
All right. Focus, breathe,

19:04.458 --> 19:05.583
And kick.

19:05.667 --> 19:07.375
Hyah!
- Hyah.

19:07.458 --> 19:09.375
Hey, way to get your leg up, mongo.

19:10.041 --> 19:11.583
Has anyone seen Titus?

19:12.166 --> 19:13.458
Flap your arms,

19:13.542 --> 19:14.834
flap your wings,

19:14.917 --> 19:17.125
float like a butterfly.

19:18.667 --> 19:20.417
-
- Hey, Rudy,

19:20.500 --> 19:21.750
your scones are ready.

19:21.834 --> 19:24.083
No. Our scones.

19:24.166 --> 19:25.750
Ooh!

19:48.875 --> 19:50.542
Wow, Krupnick.

19:50.625 --> 19:51.875
Killer ride.

19:52.583 --> 19:55.041
I see you know how to show up
to my party in style.

19:55.125 --> 19:57.041
Sorry we're late, Matt.

19:57.125 --> 19:59.166
We got this Mustang out on the open range,

19:59.250 --> 20:01.792
and he wanted to do what mustangs do.

20:05.542 --> 20:06.750
Run wild.

20:06.834 --> 20:08.333
Oh, right.

20:08.417 --> 20:09.291
Gina.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.667
I've got my cherry-berry lip balm.

20:11.750 --> 20:13.375
It makes my lips taste like cherry,

20:14.333 --> 20:15.542
and berry,

20:15.625 --> 20:16.917
and bomb.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.375
Let's get this party thumping!

20:22.417 --> 20:23.834
Jerry, Milton,

20:23.917 --> 20:25.375
I'm glad you guys are here.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.959
Ooh! That's right. You heard him.

20:29.041 --> 20:30.500
He's glad we're here.

20:30.583 --> 20:32.667
That's because we're men now, Jerry.

20:32.750 --> 20:34.917
Tonight was a night
that changed our lives.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.792
From this day forward, we fear nothing.

20:42.917 --> 20:43.750
Gah!

20:43.834 --> 20:46.291
My dad's gonna stop by the library
to bring me a study snack.

20:46.375 --> 20:47.709
-
- We've got to get the car back.

20:47.792 --> 20:49.083
Go, go, go!

20:56.625 --> 20:57.750
Whoo.

21:00.375 --> 21:02.667
It was really nice of your sister
to let us use her bike.

21:02.750 --> 21:05.166
Yeah, she said I could use it
as long as I took care of it.

21:12.250 --> 21:14.000
Where have you guys been?

21:14.083 --> 21:17.166
I have some honeys
I want to introduce you to.

21:20.917 --> 21:21.792
Ohh.

21:21.875 --> 21:23.542
Well, if you got the honeys,

21:23.625 --> 21:25.542
then here come the queen bees.

21:26.208 --> 21:27.041
King bees.

21:27.125 --> 21:28.834
We're king bees, dude.

21:28.917 --> 21:30.875
Oh, what is wrong with you?

21:56.959 --> 21:57.834
<i>Poor soul.</i>

22:01.875 --> 22:02.750
<i>Yes!</i>
