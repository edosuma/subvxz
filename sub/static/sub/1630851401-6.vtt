00:31.080 --> 00:32.040
<i>Help me.</i>

00:44.320 --> 00:45.480
Are you awake?

00:47.240 --> 00:48.480
I brought coffee.

00:50.720 --> 00:51.720
Thank you.

00:57.080 --> 00:58.080
I'm proud of you.

01:02.000 --> 01:02.920
What's up?

01:05.080 --> 01:06.920
I told you yesterday.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.800
Now we can look forward to
the election,

01:08.880 --> 01:10.680
and you'll get something
to write about.

01:11.520 --> 01:12.520
That's a promise.

03:20.760 --> 03:22.400
Yeah?

03:22.480 --> 03:23.480
What's happened?

03:26.160 --> 03:27.160
Just a detour.

03:29.240 --> 03:30.680
What are you doing here?

03:31.960 --> 03:36.200
I'm here to help. Everything you
could tell Inger, you can tell me.

03:37.160 --> 03:38.160
Yeah.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.480
The attack will happen soon.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.760
I'm definitely on the inside, but...

03:43.840 --> 03:46.640
don't use anything
but the blog for communication.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.160
They're still paranoid.

03:50.040 --> 03:51.920
-Is the attack in Berlin?
-Mm-hm.

03:52.640 --> 03:55.680
Cato's plan is related to
the election.

03:57.560 --> 04:00.360
Change Germany to change Europe.

04:01.480 --> 04:03.760
They have finances, digital assets...

04:03.840 --> 04:07.920
We must strike fast as soon as I know
the target, but that's still unclear.

04:09.760 --> 04:10.760
Do you have anything?

04:23.720 --> 04:26.240
The Germans have lost
contact with an agent.

04:32.080 --> 04:34.240
They want you to know who he is,

04:34.320 --> 04:36.640
so you don't end up
in any difficult situations.

04:40.960 --> 04:41.960
Mm-hm.

04:44.840 --> 04:45.840
His name is Jan.

04:47.480 --> 04:48.480
So you know him?

04:50.360 --> 04:51.720
Yes. Or...

04:53.480 --> 04:56.760
He worked with the crypto financing,
but...

04:58.400 --> 04:59.400
He's dead.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.040
What happened?

05:05.840 --> 05:08.480
Have you guys said anything
about me to the Germans?

05:08.560 --> 05:09.720
No.

05:10.680 --> 05:12.440
Someone leaked Jan's identity.

05:13.120 --> 05:15.800
They have someone on the inside,
that's why he was killed.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.200
Almost me too.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.640
Supposedly someone high up
in the system, in the ministry.

05:23.560 --> 05:26.200
They call their source The Scorpio.

05:31.440 --> 05:33.200
The police won't find Jan.

05:34.800 --> 05:35.800
They...

05:37.640 --> 05:40.200
burned his body,
and dissolved the remains in acid.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.200
Soon all this will be over.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.400
And you'll go back home and...

05:57.480 --> 05:58.600
live a normal life.

06:04.680 --> 06:06.800
I don't think a normal life is...

06:08.960 --> 06:10.560
possible anymore.

06:13.760 --> 06:15.440
That's how it feels now.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.480
But it will get better.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.400
I killed him.

06:26.480 --> 06:27.480
Jan.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.200
I shot him. I...

06:34.520 --> 06:35.880
Oh, fuck.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.400
Did they force you to do it?

06:41.480 --> 06:42.880
He asked me to.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.720
Let's just finish
what we came here to do.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.360
Tell Inger they trust me now.

06:54.440 --> 06:56.680
And don't tell her I shot him.

06:58.120 --> 07:00.840
I shouldn't have told you either.
Sorry.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.080
Tell her I'm on top of this.

07:10.880 --> 07:11.880
It's me.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.400
Ole?

07:51.760 --> 07:53.280
It looks good.

07:53.920 --> 07:54.720
Hi.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.040
Your post. It's good.

07:57.720 --> 07:59.840
I started reading it
and I almost can't stop.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.800
Are you on my computer?

08:04.520 --> 08:06.360
You have my password?

08:06.440 --> 08:07.640
Yes, you gave it to me.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.280
No, I didn't.

08:11.360 --> 08:12.960
Okay. Is that a problem?

08:15.800 --> 08:17.200
No, I just...

08:19.000 --> 08:20.560
Well, it's not exactly okay.

08:20.640 --> 08:22.680
I think you should
take a look at the ending.

08:22.760 --> 08:25.760
Try to punch it up a little.
And change the picture.

08:25.840 --> 08:27.440
-I put some examples on...
-OK...

08:29.000 --> 08:30.280
Where have you been?

08:31.000 --> 08:32.920
What the hell do you want me to do?

08:34.480 --> 08:38.080
I gave up my entire life to fight
for our cause! I even killed a cop.

08:38.160 --> 08:41.000
What do I have to do to make you
stop treating me like a child?

08:41.080 --> 08:43.400
-Listen, I promised...
-No! Now you listen to me!

08:43.480 --> 08:46.360
You guys need someone
to write your heroic epic? Fine.

08:46.440 --> 08:48.800
You can find someone else
because I am sick of this!

08:49.440 --> 08:50.440
Ragna.

08:54.480 --> 08:55.480
Ragna.

08:58.640 --> 09:00.120
I see your point, OK?

09:00.680 --> 09:03.440
We can talk about it later,
but I want to show you something.

09:05.760 --> 09:06.760
Come on.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.280
I want to show you something.

09:29.520 --> 09:31.000
Your agent's dead.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.160
Our agent is dead?

09:34.880 --> 09:37.560
-Yes.
<i>-I'm sorry, Kathi.</i>

09:37.640 --> 09:38.800
Oh, shit.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.280
That can't be true.

09:44.360 --> 09:46.360
And I'm afraid
you can't tell anyone.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.240
So who killed him?

09:50.360 --> 09:53.200
-We don't know. We'll find out.
-No, we will find out.

09:53.280 --> 09:55.440
LKA will go in full force
when they hear it.

09:55.520 --> 09:57.560
Yes, and that's why
you can't tell anyone.

09:57.640 --> 10:00.560
Well, we have to.
They killed our agent.

10:00.640 --> 10:02.320
Yes, and our agent confirms

10:02.400 --> 10:06.040
that someone leaked
Jan's identity to them.

10:06.120 --> 10:07.360
Oh, fuck!

10:17.400 --> 10:21.640
So... Did she say which department?
Did you get a name?

10:22.440 --> 10:24.040
Scorpio.

10:24.120 --> 10:27.520
Someone high up in the
Verfassungsschutz or the Ministry.

10:28.280 --> 10:30.240
-Scorpio?
-That's it.

10:31.400 --> 10:32.200
Scorpio.

10:32.280 --> 10:34.680
<i>Their goal is</i>
<i>to change the election.</i>

10:34.760 --> 10:38.320
How can they change the election?
What can they do to change the votes?

10:38.400 --> 10:41.040
<i>We don't know yet.</i>
<i>That's why we need your help.</i>

10:41.120 --> 10:42.760
What do you want me to do?

10:43.840 --> 10:48.160
Like I said, we're very interested
in the crypto financing part of this.

10:48.240 --> 10:51.080
And we would like everything
your ministry has on that.

10:51.160 --> 10:52.600
That is top secret.

10:53.720 --> 10:56.840
<i>We need to look into the crypto files</i>
<i>that Jan was involved in.</i>

10:57.480 --> 11:00.600
<i>They may give us information</i>
<i>on what they are financing.</i>

11:01.480 --> 11:03.720
You're asking me
to commit high treason.

11:03.800 --> 11:09.040
<i>Until you find The Scorpio, we are</i>
<i>your only chance to stop the terror.</i>

11:17.680 --> 11:18.680
OK.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.840
I'll get you the files
and I'll give you 48 hours.

11:22.920 --> 11:25.840
Then I have to start
investigating the missing agent.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Thank you.

11:57.240 --> 11:58.800
That's enough. Come.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.000
Come, come, come.

12:07.320 --> 12:08.640
Sorry I'm late.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.640
Urgent meeting.

12:11.720 --> 12:14.000
-What meeting?
-An urgent one.

12:14.080 --> 12:16.720
I'm just asking because
I tried to call you before.

12:16.800 --> 12:19.480
Yes, I know. And now I'm here. Eva?

12:19.560 --> 12:23.360
In the further evaluation of the
Safar brothers' telecommunications,

12:23.440 --> 12:25.520
one man appears
particularly frequently.

12:25.600 --> 12:29.840
They call him The Teacher.
His real name is Fahdil Al Dabbas.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.720
He lives in Berlin
and works as an electrical engineer.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.960
He has a wife and four children.

12:35.040 --> 12:37.520
All members of the Muslim community
in Kreuzberg.

12:37.600 --> 12:41.880
In the Iraq war, Fahdil was one
of Saddam Hussein's best snipers.

12:41.960 --> 12:45.880
They call him The Teacher because
he trained snipers during the war.

12:47.120 --> 12:49.440
It's not clear from the chats
what they're up to,

12:49.520 --> 12:52.480
but they keep exchanging information
about the upcoming elections.

12:52.560 --> 12:55.400
Especially about Amira Hamad's
public appearances.

12:58.240 --> 13:00.640
Hamad's sharp criticism
of radical Salafism

13:00.720 --> 13:02.800
makes her a traitor
in The Teacher's eyes.

13:02.880 --> 13:04.280
OK. Let's have him monitored.

13:04.360 --> 13:07.040
I'll talk to the prosecutor
after the meeting.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.200
Any news on the C4 explosives?

13:10.560 --> 13:12.640
We just can't find it.

13:13.240 --> 13:14.840
How is that possible?

13:17.640 --> 13:18.640
Helmut?

13:19.360 --> 13:20.760
Our missing man.

13:20.840 --> 13:24.320
LKA Brandenburg wants to search for
him. He's been silent for too long.

13:25.680 --> 13:26.800
We're still waiting.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.520
-What are we waiting for?
-We wait another two days.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.160
Summarize that in a report, please.

13:37.280 --> 13:39.160
Then I can look at it all again.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.480
Yeah. Sure.

13:42.360 --> 13:45.360
HASIR RESTAURANT

13:46.600 --> 13:49.320
You must try the tea. It's fantastic.

13:51.480 --> 13:54.640
I brought you here because this is
where everything began for me.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.800
My most important
formative experience.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.440
Back when I was studying
here in Berlin,

14:01.520 --> 14:04.080
I was in this area,
sitting at this exact table,

14:04.680 --> 14:07.080
drinking black tea,
like we're doing now.

14:07.160 --> 14:09.160
I was reading
Nietzsche and Spinoza,

14:09.240 --> 14:11.240
trying to understand
how they see emotions,

14:11.320 --> 14:13.560
and how they affect
people and culture.

14:14.560 --> 14:16.400
Spinoza was a stoic in many senses,

14:16.480 --> 14:21.920
but he denied
that reason could defeat emotion.

14:22.680 --> 14:25.560
This has huge consequences,
because it means that our culture,

14:25.640 --> 14:27.000
our collective identity,

14:27.080 --> 14:29.960
is shaped over time
by our common emotions.

14:30.040 --> 14:32.320
It felt like I was reading the code.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.600
Like I had taken the red pill
from The Matrix.

14:34.680 --> 14:36.400
As I was having this epiphany,

14:36.480 --> 14:39.280
I suddenly noticed that all
the people passing by had stopped.

14:39.360 --> 14:40.720
They were just staring at me.

14:43.880 --> 14:46.320
People were staring
because you understood Spinoza?

14:46.400 --> 14:49.160
I thought so at first,
but they were staring at that TV.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.480
And then I witnessed...

14:56.080 --> 14:58.880
how emotion trumps reason.

14:59.920 --> 15:02.000
That was September 11, 2001.

15:03.200 --> 15:07.720
That TV showed the second plane
crashing into the second tower live.

15:07.800 --> 15:10.480
And they showed it again.
And again and again.

15:10.560 --> 15:14.560
Emotions. Emotions. Emotions.
I was in complete shock.

15:14.640 --> 15:18.440
-Not because of what was on the TV.
-Because of what then?

15:19.080 --> 15:21.720
Because around me
stood young Arabs...

15:22.360 --> 15:24.600
born and raised in Germany...

15:24.680 --> 15:26.760
and their eyes just lit up.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.800
They just couldn't fucking hide it.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.160
It was like a silent triumph.

15:31.760 --> 15:35.120
And that's when I understood that
Spinoza and Nietzsche were right.

15:36.320 --> 15:38.320
<i>The liberal idea</i>
<i>of mixing "us" and "them"</i>

15:38.400 --> 15:41.560
<i>in order to build a peaceful society</i>
<i>is just a big fucking lie.</i>

15:42.360 --> 15:45.280
<i>If we want to change anything,</i>
<i>our culture...</i>

15:45.360 --> 15:47.600
<i>If we want to make people</i>
<i>think like we do,</i>

15:47.680 --> 15:50.280
<i>we have to change people's emotions.</i>

15:52.520 --> 15:55.360
Osama Bin Laden got that part right.

15:55.440 --> 15:59.120
There is no "us and them".
There is only "us or them".

15:59.200 --> 16:01.360
We have to fight
with everything we've got.

16:01.440 --> 16:04.440
We have to create unique,
emotional experiences.

16:06.680 --> 16:10.560
How... What are these unique
experiences going to be?

16:10.640 --> 16:11.960
A wake up call.

16:13.120 --> 16:14.880
An inciting incident.

16:15.840 --> 16:20.560
Your job is
to create narratives, stories,

16:20.640 --> 16:22.800
based on an inciting incident.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.520
Make people care about their culture.

16:25.600 --> 16:29.480
Make Europe care about Europe again.

16:41.560 --> 16:44.320
Is it part of the plan
that we won't survive?

16:50.200 --> 16:52.320
Are you willing to
sacrifice your life...

16:52.400 --> 16:54.120
to save Europe?

16:57.400 --> 16:58.400
Yes.

16:59.240 --> 17:00.440
I am.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.520
That's why I brought you here.

17:07.240 --> 17:09.600
I wanted to share
my experience with you.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.960
Because I noticed it the first time
I read your texts.

17:13.040 --> 17:14.480
You stir up emotions.

17:15.560 --> 17:17.200
You stirred up my emotions.

17:55.520 --> 17:56.520
Thomas.

17:58.200 --> 18:01.280
-Good you're here. We must talk.
-I heard. I'll speak to him.

18:01.800 --> 18:04.760
-I know he had to be careful, but...
-Chris, it's all right.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.120
He's coming!

18:18.640 --> 18:19.640
What?

18:21.720 --> 18:22.720
They're scared of you.

18:23.320 --> 18:24.720
Fear is good.

18:24.800 --> 18:25.800
Keeps us awake.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.720
-I'm scared too.
-Oh, yeah?

18:29.680 --> 18:32.040
-Of what?
-Have you talked to Ole?

18:32.120 --> 18:34.400
No. What's wrong?

18:34.480 --> 18:37.480
I think he's too fixated
on the girl.

18:37.560 --> 18:39.320
He believes in her, as do I.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.680
You're like brothers,
but you should keep an eye on him.

18:42.760 --> 18:45.800
-He has no control over his feelings.
-He knows what he's doing.

18:47.320 --> 18:48.600
What about you?

18:52.120 --> 18:54.280
Do you know what you're doing?

18:55.440 --> 18:56.760
If you'd waited twelve hours,

18:56.840 --> 18:59.920
Jan would've been exposed without
everyone sitting here in fear.

19:01.120 --> 19:04.320
To whom do you want to
prove your power? Cato?

21:22.560 --> 21:23.560
Yeah?

21:27.360 --> 21:28.880
OK. Yeah. Just hang on.

21:46.360 --> 21:48.080
Yeah. No, of course.

21:48.160 --> 21:49.680
Okay, tomorrow then.

21:49.760 --> 21:50.760
Fine. Bye.

21:53.080 --> 21:54.680
What the hell are you doing?

21:55.480 --> 21:57.600
-What's happening tomorrow?
-Ragna.

21:57.680 --> 22:00.240
Sorry. I just...

22:02.200 --> 22:04.480
What would you do
if you were in my position?

22:05.120 --> 22:07.280
No one tells me anything,
I'm just bossed around

22:07.360 --> 22:09.280
I don't even know if I'll survive.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.640
Am I just supposed to accept that?

22:13.440 --> 22:16.440
I understand there are rules,
but those rules are fucked up.

22:16.520 --> 22:18.960
-Am I a part of this, or what?
-I know.

22:19.040 --> 22:20.840
But I can't tell you anything. OK?

22:23.680 --> 22:24.560
Sorry.

22:25.800 --> 22:28.000
Come here.
I want to show you something.

22:45.880 --> 22:48.160
Look. This is the IP address
you used earlier.

22:50.800 --> 22:51.800
And now...

22:53.720 --> 22:55.280
Now I have sent you a message.

22:58.480 --> 22:59.480
Yeah?

23:09.640 --> 23:10.880
There's nothing here.

23:12.760 --> 23:13.760
No.

23:15.600 --> 23:16.760
It's not there.

23:16.840 --> 23:18.160
But if you look here.

23:19.040 --> 23:22.040
SEARCH:

23:22.120 --> 23:23.680
And click here.

23:33.600 --> 23:36.600
I can make people communicate
without knowing it.

23:37.880 --> 23:41.960
I decide what they write
and who writes to whom.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.040
All I need is the IP address.

23:47.600 --> 23:48.600
Wow.

24:04.280 --> 24:05.280
Sorry.

24:05.800 --> 24:07.800
-I'm sorry. I...
-No, I...

24:08.680 --> 24:10.600
-I just thought that...
-Sorry, I...

24:11.400 --> 24:13.880
I just wasn't expecting that.

24:13.960 --> 24:16.640
No, of course not.
I wasn't expecting it either.

24:18.560 --> 24:19.720
-I'm sorry.
-Hey.

24:22.240 --> 24:25.000
I'm guessing there are rules
about this as well.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.680
Not getting distracted.

24:32.360 --> 24:33.440
Yes.

24:33.520 --> 24:34.800
Good night.

24:36.480 --> 24:37.480
Good night.

24:41.520 --> 24:43.040
Tomorrow I'll introduce you.

24:44.360 --> 24:45.360
To Cato?

24:48.520 --> 24:51.520
To a life-changing experience.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Good night.

25:16.600 --> 25:17.960
-Hey.
-Come in.

25:19.320 --> 25:21.880
No, I don't want to disturb
your family.

25:21.960 --> 25:25.280
There's no one here since my
ex-husband moved out, so come on in.

25:31.560 --> 25:34.200
I have some pretty good Barolo
if you like.

25:35.640 --> 25:37.960
Actually, with the cork
pressed inside.

25:38.040 --> 25:39.640
That's fine.

25:52.600 --> 25:55.440
So he took your wine opener, huh?

25:55.520 --> 25:58.520
Yes. And the wine glasses.

26:03.320 --> 26:04.200
Here.

26:07.480 --> 26:08.480
Cheers.

26:24.360 --> 26:25.360
Sorry.

26:26.440 --> 26:29.000
-Not very ladylike, I know.
-No, that's...

26:31.880 --> 26:33.960
I guess I have to drink up
my courage.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.520
I could go to jail for this.

26:44.400 --> 26:46.560
You're trying to prevent
the world blowing up.

26:47.440 --> 26:50.440
I'll tell that to the prosecutors
if this goes to hell.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.520
This is not going to hell.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
No.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.600
No, of course not.
I didn't mean to...

26:57.680 --> 26:58.680
I'm sorry.

27:01.360 --> 27:04.000
Inger told me about your girlfriend,
the informant.

27:05.680 --> 27:08.160
We will all do our best.

27:11.120 --> 27:12.320
Yeah.

27:12.400 --> 27:15.400
-I'm sorry. I didn't...
-No, I know. I'm sorry.

27:16.320 --> 27:17.960
I'm... I just...

27:23.880 --> 27:26.480
Do you mind
if I just sit here for a while?

27:29.160 --> 27:30.160
No.

28:05.920 --> 28:07.000
Good morning.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.520
Morning.

28:12.200 --> 28:16.200
I have to leave in five and my maid
comes in 45 minutes, so...

28:17.280 --> 28:20.520
-I'll be gone by then.
-No, it's all right.

28:33.280 --> 28:34.280
Yes?

28:36.360 --> 28:37.360
What?

28:41.200 --> 28:42.200
Shit.

28:43.720 --> 28:47.120
OK, we'll skip the status meeting
and go to Böhringer immediately.

28:47.200 --> 28:48.480
I'll hurry.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.520
He disappeared without a trace.

28:50.600 --> 28:53.600
No message to anyone we monitor.
Nothing.

28:53.680 --> 28:56.360
We didn't have time to set up
his surveillance at all.

28:56.440 --> 28:59.280
As soon as we knew he existed,
he was gone.

28:59.360 --> 29:00.520
Wait, Eva.

29:00.600 --> 29:03.480
Do you think it's possible
that we have a leak?

29:05.440 --> 29:07.960
-Do you know something?
-Do you think it's possible?

29:08.800 --> 29:10.320
Anything is possible.

29:10.880 --> 29:11.840
Who?

29:14.080 --> 29:15.080
I have no idea.

29:22.560 --> 29:24.200
<i>Minister...</i>

29:24.280 --> 29:27.840
To make it really clear,
we urgently advise you to cancel

29:27.920 --> 29:30.840
all events with over
1,000 participants today,

29:30.920 --> 29:32.240
for security reasons.

29:32.800 --> 29:34.520
Because a terrorist attack

29:34.600 --> 29:38.280
among 1,000 people isn't
mediagenic enough? How cynical.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.080
No, I'm just trying to be realistic.

29:40.160 --> 29:42.560
If it were up to me,
we would cancel all events.

29:42.640 --> 29:45.880
Stegemann, what do you say?
Can you keep this city safe?

29:48.120 --> 29:50.120
The situation is under control.

29:50.200 --> 29:51.680
Again, just to make clear

29:51.760 --> 29:55.240
why they call
Fahdil Al Dabbas The Teacher.

29:55.320 --> 29:59.520
He trained snipers and was himself
Saddam Hussein's best sniper.

29:59.600 --> 30:02.360
He can kill someone
from two kilometers away.

30:02.440 --> 30:05.160
He completed electrical
engineering training in Germany.

30:05.240 --> 30:07.960
That means he can build
a detonator out of a toaster.

30:08.800 --> 30:11.000
You don't need to
paint the devil on the wall

30:11.080 --> 30:14.080
because you lost a terrorist
and twelve kilograms of C4.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.880
We all got it.
It's not that complicated.

30:16.960 --> 30:19.200
But I cannot follow
your suggested solutions.

30:19.280 --> 30:23.280
One of the events that we consider
among the most likely targets

30:23.360 --> 30:25.320
is your public televised debate

30:25.400 --> 30:28.080
with Amira Hamad and
Rudolf Hensel tomorrow evening.

30:29.200 --> 30:31.560
-And now you want to scare me too?
-No.

30:32.200 --> 30:35.240
But we strongly advise you
to cancel the event.

30:35.320 --> 30:37.280
That's the easiest way for you.

30:37.360 --> 30:40.120
While I'll have to deal with
a massive shitstorm,

30:40.200 --> 30:42.080
when it later turns out
that we canceled

30:42.160 --> 30:44.560
the last important TV debate
with the top candidates

30:44.640 --> 30:46.880
because we don't do our job properly.

30:46.960 --> 30:50.360
What kind of logic is that?
We're doing our job right now.

30:50.440 --> 30:53.800
Then find the man. Germany will not
postpone the election because of you.

30:53.880 --> 30:54.880
Minister...

30:55.920 --> 30:58.000
My main task is security.

30:58.080 --> 30:59.760
-And the threat...
-Rainer.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.240
What do you think?

31:04.880 --> 31:06.840
I think we still have some time.

31:06.920 --> 31:09.920
Maybe the situation clears up
by tomorrow evening.

31:11.360 --> 31:14.440
In the meantime, we should
work on alternative solutions.

31:14.520 --> 31:15.520
Right.

31:16.200 --> 31:19.080
Let's look for alternative solutions.

31:19.160 --> 31:20.160
Thank you.

31:31.400 --> 31:33.080
Shitstorm from the NAD?

31:33.160 --> 31:36.520
Fear of Islamists
who were trained in Germany

31:36.600 --> 31:38.760
is exactly what
they would crucify him for.

31:40.600 --> 31:44.080
We must inform the other candidates
directly about the possible threat.

31:45.680 --> 31:47.560
OK. I'll take care of it.

31:48.440 --> 31:51.440
But don't get your hopes up.
They'll all appear.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.120
<i>We wish you a wonderful morning.</i>

32:14.200 --> 32:16.120
<i>Good morning, dear viewers.</i>

32:16.200 --> 32:20.120
<i>Today we'll first look at</i>
<i>the eagerly awaited TV debate</i>

32:20.200 --> 32:24.520
<i>between the three leading candidates</i>
<i>for the office of Federal Chancellor.</i>

32:24.600 --> 32:25.400
Hi.

32:25.480 --> 32:26.800
<i>According to recent polls,</i>

32:26.880 --> 32:30.120
<i>Interior Minister von Hardenberg</i>
<i>of the Conservative Party</i>

32:30.200 --> 32:33.360
<i>is a few percentage points ahead of</i>
<i>Social Democrat Amira Hamad.</i>

32:33.440 --> 32:36.960
<i>But Rudolf Hensel, the leader</i>
<i>of the New Alternative for Germany,</i>

32:37.040 --> 32:40.080
<i>made significant gains</i>
<i>at the expense of the other parties.</i>

32:40.160 --> 32:43.560
<i>Tonight, all three candidates</i>
<i>will debate each other</i>

32:43.640 --> 32:45.200
<i>in the Berlin Congress Center.</i>

32:46.720 --> 32:48.080
All three of them are useless.

32:48.960 --> 32:50.120
All three.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.920
And of course they don't dare
to let Teupitz participate.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.240
Who is Teupitz?

32:54.320 --> 32:56.160
The number two of NAD.

32:56.240 --> 32:57.720
A true visionary.

32:58.400 --> 32:59.800
Firm. Determined.

33:00.360 --> 33:01.880
But she is the worst of all.

33:03.520 --> 33:04.520
Amira Hamad.

33:06.240 --> 33:08.520
All she represents
is the downfall of Europe.

33:09.840 --> 33:12.200
Her mother is Cypriot,
her father is Egyptian.

33:12.280 --> 33:14.120
Came to Berlin as a political refugee

33:14.200 --> 33:16.880
after the coup
of the Greek military junta in 1974.

33:16.960 --> 33:19.880
Explain to me why this woman

33:19.960 --> 33:23.000
should be the leader of
the most powerful country in Europe?

33:23.080 --> 33:24.400
A refugee...

33:24.480 --> 33:26.040
multicultural...

33:26.120 --> 33:28.600
left-wing liberal...

33:28.680 --> 33:29.840
atheist...

33:29.920 --> 33:30.920
feminist...

33:31.640 --> 33:34.880
The leader of a party founded
during the industrial revolution.

33:34.960 --> 33:37.600
She has nothing new to contribute.
Nothing!

33:39.280 --> 33:41.600
Germany needs a new political wave.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.280
Get dressed.
I wanna show you something.

34:17.840 --> 34:18.840
Yes.

34:18.920 --> 34:23.080
I'm just going through
the information on the Russians.

34:23.800 --> 34:26.920
There's more than enough there
for me to begin working with.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.480
<i>I'm finding names</i>

34:28.560 --> 34:31.600
<i>that I recognize from the</i>
<i>Ziminov files from your superiors.</i>

34:31.680 --> 34:34.960
Hey! You're going to focus on
one thing, and that's Ragna.

34:35.040 --> 34:38.160
If there's a connection, we can
talk about that later. Not now.

34:38.240 --> 34:41.800
Ragna needs you and I need you.
That's the deal.

34:41.880 --> 34:44.680
I'm not going to abandon
Ragna or Kathi or anyone.

34:44.760 --> 34:47.840
I'm just saying I'm going to
go after him. Full force.

34:48.600 --> 34:51.880
<i>This crypto thing means something big</i>
<i>is happening. I will find out what.</i>

34:53.360 --> 34:55.400
Wait, hold on. Bye.

34:57.480 --> 34:58.680
<i>Hi!</i>

34:58.760 --> 35:01.280
<i>-Hello.</i>
<i>-Hi! How are you?</i>

35:05.560 --> 35:09.720
He told me he was going to
buy you a trampoline. Did he?

35:09.800 --> 35:12.920
<i>Yes. I'm going to</i>
<i>learn to do a front-flip</i>

35:13.000 --> 35:15.200
<i>-and maybe a handstand.</i>
-Cool!

35:16.080 --> 35:17.920
Can you zoom in again, please?

35:21.200 --> 35:22.720
No. Nothing.

35:22.800 --> 35:25.360
Go on. Mr. Secretary of State.

35:25.440 --> 35:27.360
I've informed the candidates.

35:28.080 --> 35:29.720
Let me guess. They want to be on TV.

35:29.800 --> 35:33.240
Those were not exactly her words,
but I think that is the truth.

35:34.080 --> 35:36.080
You get all the resources you need.

35:36.160 --> 35:39.960
Even the special forces.
That should be enough, right?

35:40.040 --> 35:41.040
Shit.

35:56.840 --> 35:57.840
Hello.

35:59.200 --> 36:03.240
GSG-9 will position four snipers two
hours before the candidates arrive.

36:07.920 --> 36:09.640
They should be here in ten minutes.

36:21.800 --> 36:22.720
-Hello.
-Hello.

36:22.800 --> 36:25.120
-Can we have one of these?
-Yes.

36:25.680 --> 36:26.800
Put this on.

36:34.240 --> 36:36.240
-Whoa, that's big...
-Yes.

36:49.880 --> 36:52.360
-Have they all been checked?
-All of them.

36:52.440 --> 36:55.400
One of them had an old record
for illegal possession of drugs.

36:55.480 --> 36:56.840
We sent him home.

37:10.520 --> 37:11.520
Come on.

37:14.160 --> 37:16.920
Perfect. Send them up.
They should check the hall first.

37:18.560 --> 37:20.240
What is Hensel doing here already?

37:20.320 --> 37:22.000
Looks like a rehearsal.

37:26.760 --> 37:29.760
THE TV DUEL
ALL THE CANDIDATES - LIVE

37:42.840 --> 37:43.840
Amira Hamad?

37:52.160 --> 37:53.160
Wait here.

37:53.240 --> 37:55.520
-Why?
-Just wait here and you'll see.

38:14.080 --> 38:16.680
Amira Hamad will need
extra protection tonight.

38:19.160 --> 38:20.120
Hello.

38:21.760 --> 38:22.760
Hi, Dad.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
Continue.

39:01.760 --> 39:03.080
Hey!

39:24.400 --> 39:27.000
