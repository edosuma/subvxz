WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:03.125
- Previously on "12 Monkeys "...
- They're coming.

00:03.253 --> 00:05.209
They've been one step ahead of us
the whole way.

00:05.339 --> 00:07.045
I know who the Witness is.

00:07.174 --> 00:09.540
Cole's not a concern. I killed him.

00:09.676 --> 00:11.962
- We have work to finish.
- Come on.

00:12.137 --> 00:14.048
- What are you doing?
- Meet the new boss.

00:14.223 --> 00:16.589
You're walking through a red forest.

00:16.725 --> 00:18.590
While you're busy saving mankind,

00:18.727 --> 00:20.888
someone has to figure out
how to save you.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.478
It matters what we do here. This time.

00:24.149 --> 00:25.855
It's over, Cole.

00:25.984 --> 00:29.522
The paradox has destroyed your
ability to travel back to your time.

00:29.655 --> 00:30.690
You live here now.

00:30.822 --> 00:33.074
It was Aaron. That's how they found us.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.191
Mr Ramse's
going to try and stop you.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.030
And when he does, I'm gonna kill him.

00:41.667 --> 00:45.159
COLE: Where are you right now?
Somewhere warm?

00:45.879 --> 00:52.125
Safe? Next to someone you love?
Now what if all that was gone?

00:53.178 --> 00:55.669
And the only thing you could do
is survive?

00:57.391 --> 01:00.599
You would, right? You'd try.

01:02.312 --> 01:05.804
You'd do things. Horrible things.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.312
Until you lose that last thing
you have left...

01:10.529 --> 01:11.644
yourself.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.522
But what if you could take it back?

01:16.952 --> 01:20.786
All of it. A reset switch.

01:22.749 --> 01:24.080
You'd hit it, right?

01:25.836 --> 01:27.622
You'd have to.

01:27.754 --> 01:28.914
Even if you didn't want to.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.301
Because sometimes
the choice isn't even yours.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.044
It's fate.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.328
- You didn't think I could find you?
- (COUGHS)

02:04.499 --> 02:06.080
- You thought you could hide?
- (COUGHS)

02:06.209 --> 02:07.244
(GASPS)

02:07.377 --> 02:09.117
(COUGHS)

02:13.091 --> 02:15.173
(LAUGHS)

02:17.554 --> 02:19.545
You think this is funny?

02:19.681 --> 02:24.300
You're... you're angry... with me?

02:26.563 --> 02:30.397
You destroyed everything in my life.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.851
You're no savior, Cole.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.568
You're just a savage.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.274
You wanna know what makes a savage?

02:41.328 --> 02:43.865
Seeing shit no kid should ever see.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.908
And then doing
the same thing to survive.

02:47.834 --> 02:48.869
l was just a boy.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.206
Watching the world die alone.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.377
Now I know
who I have to thank for that.

03:00.097 --> 03:01.337
(COUGHS)

03:05.268 --> 03:06.883
Who are they?

03:07.020 --> 03:09.011
- (SIGHS)
-Hmm?

03:11.066 --> 03:12.397
Who are they?

03:29.376 --> 03:32.789
Aaron, just tell us
who you've been talking to.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.003
Cassie.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.255
We could survive the plague.

03:40.262 --> 03:41.468
But not with him.

03:44.099 --> 03:46.806
AARON: Come with me. Stop this. Please.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.852
Please?

04:07.622 --> 04:09.078
Is it growing here?

04:11.209 --> 04:12.460
What's it coming from?

04:13.503 --> 04:16.995
lf botany were my field of expertise,
Mr Whitley,

04:17.132 --> 04:18.918
none of us would be alive.

04:19.050 --> 04:21.507
We'd all be lying dead
in an empty greenhouse.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.010
Temporal interference of some kind.

04:24.139 --> 04:27.006
Or could merely be a random
sampling of the time stream

04:27.142 --> 04:29.929
caused by electro-magnetic build-up.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.141
An anomaly.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.057
This is not random.

04:33.190 --> 04:35.055
You know, I've been thinking.

04:35.192 --> 04:37.729
As soon as my hands heal,
I want you to give me the injections.

04:38.862 --> 04:40.853
I want you to send me to 2015.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.985
And if you survived,
where would that get us?

04:49.915 --> 04:52.702
The mission is over, Mr Whitley.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.541
Then what are we doing here? Hmm?

04:56.296 --> 04:59.254
The men who attacked us
were sending a message.

04:59.341 --> 05:02.424
Focus on our perimeter.
Double our security.

05:02.552 --> 05:05.715
We don't have the manpower to fend off
an attack. Not after Spearhead.

05:07.098 --> 05:08.508
Look, Jones...

05:12.062 --> 05:17.102
...if you're really done here,
let it go.

05:19.152 --> 05:22.770
We should shut this thing down.
Move on.

05:32.874 --> 05:36.287
Well, their numbers are thinning.
Looks like your message was received.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.543
Which is surprising
cos it was so subtle.

05:39.172 --> 05:42.335
But, still, I wouldn't take it as a sign
that they're not ready for a fight.

05:42.467 --> 05:46.756
If you believe their sentries have been
diminished, why not a direct assault?

05:46.930 --> 05:49.592
Sentries. (LAUGHS)

05:49.766 --> 05:53.975
You... you use the term "sentries."
That is so old-timey.

05:54.145 --> 05:56.477
Where are you from, exactly?

05:58.149 --> 05:59.400
Huh?

06:00.443 --> 06:03.901
Listen, friend, I thought they
were light the first time I went in,

06:04.030 --> 06:05.861
and they took off half my crew.

06:05.991 --> 06:08.778
Hence our little... collaboration.

06:08.910 --> 06:12.823
But trust me when | tell you,
they are lean but mean.

06:12.998 --> 06:15.330
I think you will find us formidable.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.245
Oh, well, no doubt.

06:19.170 --> 06:22.412
But I do not want
that place all shot up.

06:22.549 --> 06:25.006
After you're done with your thing,
it's mine.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.342
Our deal will be honored, Mr Deacon.

06:27.512 --> 06:31.505
As long this plan of yours
is successful.

06:31.725 --> 06:36.139
Don't you worry.
They're not gonna see this coming.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.770
- (SIGHS)
- This isn't something I wanna do.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.272
But I will.

06:48.783 --> 06:49.818
COLE: And you know that.

06:57.292 --> 07:00.284
- I just wanted to save you.
- Who are they?

07:04.007 --> 07:05.838
There's a woman.

07:08.303 --> 07:10.009
She's the only one I ever saw.

07:11.806 --> 07:16.300
They know it's coming.
They're planning for it.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.139
How do they release the virus?

07:19.022 --> 07:20.057
I don't know.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.641
They're preparing for something.

07:26.321 --> 07:29.654
She said it was the "coming of the 12."

07:29.824 --> 07:31.200
What else?

07:32.327 --> 07:35.945
They financed a project... Colorado.

07:37.916 --> 07:38.996
They're gonna hide.

07:40.293 --> 07:44.286
Some kind of facility. That's
where they'll be when the world dies.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.208
Ramse.
You ever meet a man named Ramse?

07:49.260 --> 07:50.466
Alright. How do we find them?

07:50.595 --> 07:54.179
Markridge.
The woman is one of their key investors.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.222
They'll kill me for this.

08:02.190 --> 08:07.150
And then him... and then you.

08:11.616 --> 08:12.651
Makes sense.

08:12.867 --> 08:16.735
Makes sense that they'd finance
the company that creates the plague.

08:17.539 --> 08:22.704
COLE: We need to find this investor.
Could be the one key we've been missing.

08:24.379 --> 08:26.370
We can't let him go. He knows more.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.473
COLE: Aaron!

08:52.198 --> 08:53.608
(YELLS)

09:01.207 --> 09:02.913
Oh, my God.

09:04.335 --> 09:05.791
- Oh, my God!
- Oh! Hey!

09:06.004 --> 09:08.586
- We gotta get outta here now.
- We can'tjust leave him here to die!

09:08.715 --> 09:10.797
Cassie! He made his choice! Come on!

09:10.967 --> 09:13.583
- (AARON SCREAMS)
- AARON: Cassie!

09:15.764 --> 09:17.925
(SCREAMS)

09:39.079 --> 09:40.740
Cassie, I'm sorry.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.246
What happened wasn't your fault.

09:44.375 --> 09:48.334
- Aaron...
- Betrayed us. He betrayed me.

09:49.214 --> 09:51.671
- Yeah. But it's not that simple.
- We have work to finish.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.172
We have to focus.

10:00.600 --> 10:04.309
That woman.
One of Markridge's key investors.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.597
Yeah.

10:05.730 --> 10:08.437
Chances are she knows the new CEO.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.437
You gotta be kidding me.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.159
Who are all these people?

10:25.333 --> 10:28.575
Doctors, shareholders.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.576
They're all here
for the keynote address.

10:30.713 --> 10:34.706
They all want to know where
the new CEO is gonna lead Markridge.

10:45.478 --> 10:50.598
Leland Goines, my father,
was just a man.

10:52.277 --> 10:54.188
But what kind of man?

10:55.572 --> 11:01.112
A charitable man,
a giving man, a wise man.

11:01.911 --> 11:06.371
And, most importantly... a family man.

11:06.499 --> 11:10.162
Except that my father
was none of those things.

11:10.295 --> 11:15.380
No. My father
was only ever a Markridge man.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.669
(APPLAUSE)

11:23.224 --> 11:27.593
I love you, Dad. Miss you.

11:29.314 --> 11:31.521
That's why we're all here today,
isn't it?

11:31.649 --> 11:35.392
Not to eulogize, but to capitalize.

11:35.528 --> 11:38.144
Through continued advancements
in bio-engineering.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.063
Through government contracts.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.237
Through strategic partnerships
and a renewed push

11:43.369 --> 11:45.280
into pharmaceutical retail.

11:45.413 --> 11:49.076
We will realize my father's vision
for Markridge.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.450
And we will transcend it.

11:51.586 --> 11:53.668
(APPLAUSE)

11:55.173 --> 11:56.253
They love her.

11:56.382 --> 11:59.499
Looks like she finally got
the dosage right on those meds.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.713
One more thing.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.263
The dodo.

12:06.100 --> 12:11.311
Silly thing. Couldn't fly. Too fat.

12:11.439 --> 12:15.899
Flapped its wings futilely...
into extinction.

12:17.528 --> 12:21.567
My father created Markridge
as a place to defy the order of things.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.735
To ignore the rules.

12:23.868 --> 12:28.578
To laugh at Mother Nature
and spit in the face of Father Time.

12:28.706 --> 12:32.324
Beginning today, Markridge
will start repairing the damage

12:32.502 --> 12:34.959
that men like my father
have done to this world.

12:35.129 --> 12:38.587
Through genetic manipulation,
we will give new birth

12:38.758 --> 12:41.841
to what man has
so arrogantly made extinct.

12:41.970 --> 12:47.306
The lease is up. Time to give
the world back to its rightful owners.

12:47.433 --> 12:48.468
The animals!

12:49.602 --> 12:54.767
The lions and tigers and bears.
The furry-faced caretakers.

12:54.899 --> 12:57.641
- Let's get to her before they kill her.
- Yeah.

12:58.611 --> 13:04.151
Right to work. This year the dodo.
Next year, the unicorn!

13:05.201 --> 13:07.408
- MAN: Miss Goines.
- MAN 2: Over here.

13:07.537 --> 13:10.779
Excuse me. Sorry. No. Sorry.

13:11.874 --> 13:12.909
Jennifer!

13:15.336 --> 13:18.123
Otter eyes. Back from thin air.

13:18.256 --> 13:19.666
We need to talk.

13:20.633 --> 13:24.171
That whole Night Room thing?
What a rabbit hole.

13:24.304 --> 13:28.388
(LAUGHS) I was off my meds. Super cray.

13:28.516 --> 13:34.512
Like I saw things. Like you.
Disappearing before my eyes. (LAUGHS)

13:35.857 --> 13:38.143
Lots of nuts in that bar. (LAUGHS)

13:38.276 --> 13:39.516
But I'm all better now.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.643
You sure about that?
Because the dodo bird...

13:41.779 --> 13:44.521
Oh, my God, those guys are such dicks.
(LAUGHS)

13:44.657 --> 13:48.775
I just wanted to see their faces when
they realized I set their money on fire.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.036
I have other plans for my company.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.201
So you're not cloning a dodo?

13:54.334 --> 13:58.077
Of course I am. I'm not a liar.
I hate you.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.961
Jennifer, we need your help.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.507
There's an investor in Markridge,
a real power player.

14:04.635 --> 14:07.627
- We're trying to find out who it is.
- She talks too much.

14:07.764 --> 14:10.346
CASSIE:
They've probably made key investments

14:10.516 --> 14:12.768
that have led
to significant advancements...

14:12.894 --> 14:16.261
- Blip-blop-blibbity-blah.
- ...in your father's work.

14:16.397 --> 14:19.013
That's all I hear
when your face hole opens.

14:21.694 --> 14:25.403
I don't have time for your crazy
bullshit. There's too much at stake.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.567
And my patience is gone.

14:30.328 --> 14:35.698
Ethan Seki. Venture capitalist. Genius.

14:35.833 --> 14:41.078
That's who you're looking for.
Has a gift. Knows things.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.795
When to invest, when not to.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.341
COLE: That's Ramse.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.461
- That's him?
- Yeah.

14:49.597 --> 14:52.805
He looks exactly the same.
I don't know how that's possible?

14:52.934 --> 14:55.676
Maybe it's Jones's injections.
You said...

14:57.772 --> 15:00.605
You said they make it
so time moves around you.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.849
Maybe they have an effect
on cellular aging.

15:03.903 --> 15:07.236
He's recently become obsessed
with this government project.

15:07.365 --> 15:09.526
Was looking for an intro.

15:09.659 --> 15:12.150
- Raritan Valley...
- Raritan Valley National Laboratory?

15:12.328 --> 15:15.786
That's it. Called about it today.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.951
- Today...
- What is it?

15:18.084 --> 15:19.449
We need to leave. Now.

15:20.878 --> 15:24.837
Jennifer, thank you. Again.

15:32.557 --> 15:35.173
(PHONE RINGS)

15:40.273 --> 15:42.059
It's done. He knows.

15:47.530 --> 15:48.861
CASSIE: What's Raritan?

15:48.948 --> 15:51.906
It's where they built the machine
that sent me here. Project Splinter.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.615
What does Ramse want with it?

15:53.786 --> 15:55.526
My mission begins with that facility.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.494
It's the only thing that can
stop their plan.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.033
He wants to destroy it.

15:59.167 --> 16:01.783
If he does, it'll protect the future.
And his son.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.555
What are you seeing?

16:16.225 --> 16:21.185
RAMSE: I'm trying to remember
the future... my past.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.937
Your longing for your son
will soon be over.

16:27.820 --> 16:32.154
I can't remember his face.

16:32.366 --> 16:37.076
We're coming to the end.
It's natural to be afraid.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.455
Who is that?

16:49.592 --> 16:53.426
Your security.
He will accompany you to Raritan.

16:54.597 --> 16:55.757
I don't need him.

16:59.602 --> 17:03.686
STRIKING WOMAN: Today is a great day,
but we must still be cautious.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.850
Your anonymous investments
in their research

17:05.983 --> 17:10.727
made your existence here possible.
But now their role in this is finished.

17:10.863 --> 17:14.697
The circle is completing,
tightening with each action.

17:14.825 --> 17:18.659
It's not completed
till I get to that machine.

17:23.584 --> 17:24.744
It's been a long time.

17:24.877 --> 17:28.369
We had to allow their research
to progress without interference.

17:28.506 --> 17:30.121
That meant sacrificing influence.

17:31.175 --> 17:33.416
It's a delicate balance
and it ends today.

17:34.470 --> 17:38.383
Your entry into Project Splinter
will expose us, but it's necessary.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.262
As you know,
it's a difficult place to get into.

17:49.694 --> 17:51.559
They're ready.

17:52.238 --> 17:56.072
Gentlemen, prepare to witness
Mother Nature at her finest.

17:57.159 --> 18:00.322
The animals are drawn
to the sub-sonic frequency of the core.

18:00.496 --> 18:04.205
Well, the... just trust me,
for years at Spearhead,

18:04.333 --> 18:05.664
this was a huge headache for me.

18:05.793 --> 18:09.456
And this many all at once...
that place is going dark.

18:11.507 --> 18:12.872
Let's see what you got.

18:13.009 --> 18:14.840
As long as you hold up
your end of the bargain.

18:14.969 --> 18:16.630
I'm sorry, what was that again?

18:17.722 --> 18:20.304
You make sure that bitch pays
for what she did to Spearhead.

18:55.635 --> 18:59.924
The grid's gone haywire.
The core shut down. It overheated.

19:00.056 --> 19:01.091
How is that possible?

19:01.223 --> 19:04.056
Something blocked the exhaust.
The system crashed.

19:04.185 --> 19:07.803
This is it. They're coming.

19:27.625 --> 19:30.287
(SIGHS) OK. Initiate splinter sequence.

19:41.597 --> 19:42.837
Did it work?

19:43.641 --> 19:46.849
28 years. (SIGHS)
Can't know for sure, though, can we?

19:47.853 --> 19:49.389
TECH: I don't think the data is lying.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.849
We have achieved
temporal displacement

19:51.982 --> 19:54.189
and have found a way
to make it incredibly boring.

19:54.985 --> 19:58.978
I know, I know.
Progress is a game of inches.

19:59.115 --> 20:01.902
Leaps and bounds are only in hindsight.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.241
I've been around
long enough to understand that.

20:04.370 --> 20:07.328
But it's like Kat always used to say,
you know, man,

20:07.456 --> 20:12.917
"Sometimes science is literally
like watching paint dry."

20:13.045 --> 20:15.957
(SIGHS) We're ready, man.
We're ready for a living specimen.

20:16.090 --> 20:19.833
And I'm not talking about a plant.
I'm talking about a primate subject.

20:19.969 --> 20:23.257
Distortion of time and space and its
effect on plants is considerable.

20:23.389 --> 20:27.223
Right? Green to red.
Organic matter in states of flux.

20:28.352 --> 20:31.435
- You could kill anything that...
- It'll work. It'll work.

20:33.649 --> 20:34.980
This came for you, sir.

20:38.821 --> 20:40.402
The money has landed.

20:42.616 --> 20:45.449
Uh, everybody out. Let's go.
You, too, man.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.868
You sure?
I can help with the dog and pony show.

20:47.997 --> 20:51.080
- Not this time, you can't.
- I'll finish logs in the morning.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.923
Right through here.
These exhaust tunnels are the way in.

21:11.228 --> 21:12.308
Let's go.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.403
(GUNFIRE)

21:28.621 --> 21:29.861
Fire!

21:57.691 --> 21:59.943
- Katarina...
- What are you gonna do with that?

22:06.325 --> 22:07.360
Jones.

22:18.087 --> 22:22.922
- CASSIE: What is this place?
- COLE: That's home.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.721
CASSIE: That's a lot of security.

22:32.726 --> 22:35.513
More than we ever saw
at a Markridge facility.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.188
How the hell do we get in?

22:39.358 --> 22:41.394
Exhaust tunnels...

22:46.699 --> 22:50.567
Mister Seki, it is a great pleasure
to finally meet you, sir.

22:55.499 --> 22:58.241
- It works?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

22:58.377 --> 23:01.995
To the degree I mentioned. I mean, we
can't bring anything backwards, right?

23:02.131 --> 23:04.213
Cos that's currently...
Like, that's impossible.

23:05.759 --> 23:08.091
We've had extraordinary success
sending things forward,

23:08.220 --> 23:09.835
so the potential is limitless.

23:12.141 --> 23:14.348
You've received the payments, right?

23:14.476 --> 23:15.852
Very generous. Yes.

23:15.978 --> 23:18.720
The advancements it will garner
are incalculable.

23:18.856 --> 23:21.142
But, sir, I need to know
what you're doing here.

23:21.275 --> 23:23.140
What are you planning?
This is my life's work.

23:23.277 --> 23:25.268
You've made the arrangements.

23:26.322 --> 23:30.736
You will have full, unauthorized
access to my machine, yes.

23:30.868 --> 23:32.233
The item?

23:40.502 --> 23:42.242
This took a lot to procure.

23:45.507 --> 23:50.251
- Mister Seki, this is beyond dangerous.
- Thank you.

23:51.847 --> 23:52.882
Yeah. OK, man.

23:53.015 --> 23:55.722
Well, uh, you know, everything is set,
as per your request.

23:55.851 --> 23:59.560
- Are you sure you wanna do this?
- Thank you for you work, Dr Jones.

24:33.097 --> 24:34.132
(GRUNTS)

24:35.432 --> 24:37.969
Security breach!
Evacuate through the tunnels!

24:38.102 --> 24:41.094
We need the woman.
The rest are meaningless.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.276
Tell security. Nine men down.

24:51.699 --> 24:54.190
We've got nine men down, at least.

24:55.285 --> 24:56.661
Doors to the chamber secured.

24:56.829 --> 24:59.912
- We need to get to the tunnels.
- We'll never make it.

25:05.713 --> 25:09.831
Marcus... I failed.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.048
What are you doing?

25:20.310 --> 25:21.891
Come on.

25:29.069 --> 25:30.855
Come on. Machine's this way.

25:35.159 --> 25:36.990
- (DOOR OPENS)
- COLE: Shit.

25:38.704 --> 25:39.989
(DOOR CLOSES)

25:40.122 --> 25:42.534
- I'm guessing that's not there in 2043.
- (SIGHS)

25:45.377 --> 25:50.246
OK, we'll split up. Better one of us
reaches the machine than neither.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.335
Alright.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.881
Go down this corridor,
down the hallway, down the stairs.

25:57.014 --> 26:01.929
Machine's a few doors in.
If you run into Ramse, be careful.

26:02.061 --> 26:05.144
I don't really know him any more.
I don't know what he's capable of.

26:06.899 --> 26:07.934
You ready?

26:52.945 --> 26:54.651
You're walking through a red forest.

26:56.824 --> 26:58.405
You're walking through a red forest.

26:59.701 --> 27:01.077
The grass is tall.

27:02.329 --> 27:03.614
Most of the blood has washed away.

27:16.552 --> 27:18.292
Don't move.

27:19.888 --> 27:20.968
Cole?

27:22.015 --> 27:23.266
Don1.

27:28.689 --> 27:30.520
You're alive.

27:32.234 --> 27:34.316
- Tokyo... I thought...
- That you killed me?

27:34.486 --> 27:37.068
I thought Tokyo
was as far as you ever got.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.192
Now I know.

27:42.995 --> 27:47.329
This whole time... it was you.

27:48.834 --> 27:49.869
Why?

27:50.085 --> 27:52.167
You're still asking that question?

27:55.090 --> 27:58.173
This... this place...

28:01.930 --> 28:05.422
Without me coming here,
it would never have happened.

28:05.559 --> 28:09.177
Jones didn't even want me there
in 2043.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.058
And it was mine.

28:12.191 --> 28:14.557
Hey. Hey!

28:16.737 --> 28:18.352
Easy.

28:19.323 --> 28:24.158
It took time travel
to create time travel.

28:24.286 --> 28:28.996
That's how it works.
There are no straight lines, brother.

28:29.124 --> 28:31.035
And now you wanna destroy it?

28:31.877 --> 28:33.538
(SIGHS)

28:37.382 --> 28:40.590
I wanna go home. To my son.

28:42.346 --> 28:44.758
- I'm done here.
- If this were really about your son...

28:46.475 --> 28:48.807
You wouldn't want him to grow up
just to die.

28:50.145 --> 28:53.057
You'd let him go.
You wouldn't kill an entire world.

28:53.190 --> 28:55.101
Foster found a cure.

28:55.234 --> 28:56.269
We'll find another one.

28:57.319 --> 29:00.152
That is our world... not this.

29:02.241 --> 29:06.280
I spent the last 28 years
living with ghosts.

29:09.706 --> 29:15.167
Our only future is the future.

29:15.295 --> 29:16.796
Is that what you've become?

29:18.006 --> 29:20.122
Someone who will kill
seven billion to save one.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.875
- You'd do the same thing.
- No. I wouldn't.

29:23.011 --> 29:24.797
Forhen

29:24.972 --> 29:30.968
You're gonna tell me you're risking your
life coming back here this whole time...

29:32.020 --> 29:33.556
...was for everyone?

29:35.941 --> 29:37.306
No.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.146
Cassie.

29:42.239 --> 29:45.106
You love her. I love my son.

29:46.576 --> 29:48.237
He deserves a future.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.949
I did what I had to.

29:52.165 --> 29:57.501
Now you... pull the trigger.

30:10.225 --> 30:12.591
Ah, your wonder machine
is right through there.

30:13.562 --> 30:17.521
They're about to reboot their core.
Re-route the exhaust system.

30:18.567 --> 30:23.561
We'll be back online in 20...
19... 18... seven...

30:23.697 --> 30:26.063
(GUNFIRE)

30:26.241 --> 30:27.401
(GRUNTS)

30:39.212 --> 30:43.330
Three... two... one. Core reboot.

30:45.302 --> 30:46.417
JONES: Don't move.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.221
Hello again.

30:56.355 --> 31:01.349
Uh... I would put that down
if I was you.

31:01.485 --> 31:03.476
JONES: Apologies, Mr Deacon.

31:03.612 --> 31:06.729
But you're looking at someone
who has nothing to live for.

31:15.624 --> 31:18.206
We represent the future, madam.

31:20.212 --> 31:22.919
We do not wish
to be relegated to the past.

31:23.048 --> 31:26.540
- Then stand down.
- That, we cannot do.

31:26.676 --> 31:30.134
No more killing.
Let the people of this facility go.

31:30.305 --> 31:33.388
- They are no opposition.
- And in return?

31:34.643 --> 31:36.008
Is this what you came for?

31:37.771 --> 31:40.513
- Yes.
- It's yours.

31:42.109 --> 31:45.567
Don't believe her. She killed
everyone at Spearhead for this thing.

31:45.737 --> 31:48.854
- She'll never give it up.
- My mistake.

31:51.451 --> 31:53.066
I'm willing to pay for it.

31:56.748 --> 31:58.909
You can't change the past.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.751
Nobody can.

32:06.091 --> 32:10.755
All that matters...
is what happens here.

32:15.016 --> 32:16.051
In this time.

32:20.981 --> 32:26.021
Let them go.
You let them walk, the machine is yours.

32:26.153 --> 32:31.773
Or... I'll kill everyone in this room.

32:39.124 --> 32:42.116
- You were my brother.
- I know.

32:42.294 --> 32:48.631
I thought I killed you.
I lived with that guilt for a long time.

32:50.302 --> 32:53.590
Killing you again
can't be the last thing I do here.

32:53.722 --> 32:55.883
It didn't have to be this way.

32:57.350 --> 32:59.011
Sometimes, you're out of moves.

33:00.896 --> 33:02.557
Atari.

33:04.608 --> 33:05.973
Atari.

33:14.701 --> 33:17.818
Whoa. It's alright. It's alright.

33:17.954 --> 33:20.821
- Easy.
- How is it alright, exactly?

33:20.957 --> 33:22.367
Put the gun down.

33:24.085 --> 33:28.454
This is him? Ramse? The Witness?

33:28.590 --> 33:30.546
- The Witness?
- It's not that simple.

33:30.675 --> 33:33.382
- You think I'm the Witness.
- Do it, Cole.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.719
- I'm not doing anything.
- Shoot him.

33:36.223 --> 33:40.262
No. Easy. I'm not the Witness.

33:41.144 --> 33:43.556
- Bullshit.
- Cassie, don't do this.

33:43.688 --> 33:49.024
"Don't do this?" He's killing everyone.

33:49.152 --> 33:51.359
It's about his son. I can talk to him.

33:51.488 --> 33:56.699
Tell me, Ramse. Can we talk about this?

33:57.953 --> 34:03.698
- You, put the gun down now.
- Don't! Don't do anything.

34:06.211 --> 34:09.669
Cassie... put the gun down.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.088
Please.

34:32.112 --> 34:33.318
He made his choice.

34:34.531 --> 34:35.896
No!

34:37.534 --> 34:38.740
Cassie!

34:53.925 --> 34:56.792
Disarm them. And let them go.

34:56.928 --> 35:02.048
Wait, uh, I would not recommend
that. They are going to be a problem.

35:02.142 --> 35:03.928
Foryou,notus.

35:06.896 --> 35:07.931
Marcus.

35:44.517 --> 35:46.929
- There's no exit wound.
- Cassie.

35:47.062 --> 35:48.927
Tell me what to do.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.020
I'm bleeding internally.

35:53.234 --> 35:57.193
- We need help. We need to call someone.
- They won't make it in time.

36:06.623 --> 36:08.204
Send her to Jones.

36:09.250 --> 36:11.707
We're both gonna die here.

36:13.129 --> 36:16.371
She'll save her. She won't save me.

36:17.509 --> 36:20.376
- RAMSE: You inject her with that.
- That could kill her.

36:20.553 --> 36:22.384
She's gonna die here anyway, man.

36:40.407 --> 36:43.399
- CASSIE: What are you doing?
- I'm sending you to Katarina.

36:44.869 --> 36:46.200
Cole, this won't work.

37:06.182 --> 37:08.047
- You OK?
- Mm-hmm.

37:10.103 --> 37:11.559
Good bye.

37:13.022 --> 37:14.808
I'm gonna see you soon.

37:16.901 --> 37:20.143
I don't think so. (SNIFFS)

37:24.242 --> 37:25.448
Aah.

38:09.204 --> 38:11.115
You make it back there...

38:13.124 --> 38:17.493
..you find my son. Alright?

38:20.173 --> 38:22.380
Tell him I tried to protect him.

38:25.178 --> 38:28.841
I... Itried.

39:02.006 --> 39:03.542
The Twelve are ready.

39:05.426 --> 39:09.135
All Twelve? All healthy?

39:09.264 --> 39:10.549
Would you like to see them?

39:28.825 --> 39:33.444
How beautiful.
At last, the next cycle has begun.

39:35.206 --> 39:39.290
MAN: In 28 years, they'll be ready.
This is quite the undertaking.

39:40.253 --> 39:43.416
STRIKING WOMAN: It has to be.
Nothing is more important.

39:56.769 --> 39:59.226
The cycle is complete.

40:00.940 --> 40:02.601
Make sure it is ready.

40:03.568 --> 40:05.900
You're certain of all this?

40:06.029 --> 40:08.270
The Witness has spoken.

40:10.158 --> 40:12.023
But what of Jose Ramse?

40:13.328 --> 40:17.116
STRIKING WOMAN:
On this day, November 11 th of 2015,

40:17.248 --> 40:19.830
history will show that
Ethan Seki will be found dead

40:19.959 --> 40:22.575
beside the accelerator
he helped finance.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.870
His circle will come to an end.

40:25.632 --> 40:27.463
And James Cole?

40:28.801 --> 40:31.087
STRIKING WOMAN:
James Cole will flee into obscurity,

40:31.262 --> 40:37.258
his future unknown to us.
All of this is pre-ordained.

40:37.393 --> 40:40.135
Scripted by time. Unmovable.

40:40.271 --> 40:44.105
Because there is nothing
more powerful than fate.

41:01.209 --> 41:02.198
What are you doing?

41:02.335 --> 41:06.248
No one has to die.
We'll find another way.

41:06.381 --> 41:08.497
We'll find another way.

41:13.513 --> 41:17.802
We will need her. Lock her up.

41:21.312 --> 41:23.268
Come with me.

41:25.024 --> 41:28.107
Where's Cole? Did he go in that thing?

41:28.987 --> 41:30.943
Yes, and he'll never come back.

41:35.284 --> 41:36.740
You were saying?

41:39.330 --> 41:41.446
What is this?

41:48.589 --> 41:50.250
(GASPS)

41:56.889 --> 41:58.845
Cassie.

42:06.024 --> 42:11.735
MAN: The virus? Isn't there a better
way? Something more reliable.

42:11.904 --> 42:14.771
STRIKING WOMAN: The release
of the virus is out of our hands.

42:14.907 --> 42:16.647
Exactly as it should be.

42:16.784 --> 42:20.368
What an extraordinary itinerary.
Around the world,

42:20.496 --> 42:25.206
12 cities in just a few months.
Tell me this trip is for pleasure.
