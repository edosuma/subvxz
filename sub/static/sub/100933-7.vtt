00:01.120 --> 00:03.710
Previously on "Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...

00:03.710 --> 00:04.790
Coulson:
And who are you?
Sibyl.

00:04.790 --> 00:06.000
They call me
the Predictor,

00:06.000 --> 00:07.080
but I simply read
the Time Streams.

00:07.080 --> 00:08.420
Where am I?

00:08.420 --> 00:09.580
Surrounded by Hunters
in our time ship.

00:13.290 --> 00:15.210
Simmons:
Are those prisoners?
They're my parents.

00:15.210 --> 00:17.120
It's okay.
We're here to get you out.

00:17.120 --> 00:19.210
John, you mind if I take a look
at your arm?

00:19.210 --> 00:20.420
John: It's just a scratch,
right?

00:21.620 --> 00:22.790
What'd you do
with my parents?

00:22.790 --> 00:23.830
They've been gone
a while.

00:26.500 --> 00:27.580
Hang on!

00:28.500 --> 00:29.500
Don't do it, Mack.

00:32.330 --> 00:33.620
Where are you going, man?

00:33.620 --> 00:34.880
Just need some air.

00:34.880 --> 00:36.170
Deke: Mack!

00:36.170 --> 00:38.750
Mack, we gotta go!
Z1's in trouble!

01:00.210 --> 01:03.210
Agent Shaw,
I want a full report.

01:03.210 --> 01:05.580
What happened?

01:05.580 --> 01:07.290
Start from the beginning.

01:08.830 --> 01:10.880
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

01:10.880 --> 01:14.880
Try me,
and we'll find out.

01:16.710 --> 01:19.170
Well...

01:21.000 --> 01:22.670
Feldman: Almost there,
little friend.

01:45.040 --> 01:46.790
Boy, am I glad
you guys are open.

01:46.790 --> 01:48.580
This thing
has been on the fritz

01:48.580 --> 01:50.580
ever since last night's
power surge.

01:50.580 --> 01:53.080
You're Chip Womack.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.960
Let me guess,

01:54.960 --> 01:56.420
you read the piece
in River's End Daily.

01:56.420 --> 01:58.420
Actually, we went to
River's End High together.

01:58.420 --> 02:00.420
Class of '68?

02:00.420 --> 02:02.380
I'm Russell.

02:02.380 --> 02:05.380
Ah, did you use to run around
with Fat Sack and Petey?

02:06.580 --> 02:09.120
I never really
ran around with anyone.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.750
Well, uh, imagine that.

02:11.750 --> 02:14.960
Listen, compadre,
I got some big orders coming in,

02:14.960 --> 02:17.540
and I'm gonna need
this puppy back, ASAP.

02:17.540 --> 02:18.790
Capiche?

02:21.540 --> 02:23.250
Capiche.

03:19.790 --> 03:22.460
Who are you?

03:54.420 --> 03:56.750
Deke: Mack!

03:56.750 --> 03:58.580
Mack!

03:58.580 --> 04:00.330
Mack, it's the Zephyr --
it's gone.

04:00.330 --> 04:02.750
It jumped away.

04:02.750 --> 04:04.040
We're stranded.

04:04.040 --> 04:05.750
I just needed a minute.

04:05.750 --> 04:08.420
Yeah, well, you got
a whole lot of 1982 instead.

04:10.540 --> 04:11.880
1982.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.120
I was 10 years old.

04:16.120 --> 04:17.920
They left us behind.
Something must have gone wrong.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.750
Or the mission's over.

04:21.750 --> 04:25.460
Coulson's explosion should've
taken out the Chronicoms.

04:25.460 --> 04:27.920
So, I guess we won.

04:27.920 --> 04:29.120
Then why would
we pit stop in '82

04:29.120 --> 04:30.290
for all of five minutes?

04:30.290 --> 04:31.750
That doesn't make
any sense.

04:31.750 --> 04:33.540
None of this makes
any damn sense!

04:35.880 --> 04:37.460
We can't understand it.

04:38.670 --> 04:40.210
That's why no one
should ever mess with time,

04:40.210 --> 04:41.250
no matter
how bad things get.

04:43.120 --> 04:46.920
The past...

04:46.920 --> 04:48.620
is sacred.

04:50.420 --> 04:53.040
Listen, I'm sorry
that you've lost your parents.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.000
If there's anything
else we could have
done differently --

04:55.000 --> 04:56.420
You could have
followed orders.

04:56.420 --> 04:58.960
Who are you to take a life
into your own hands,

04:58.960 --> 05:00.540
even if you think
it's right?

05:02.790 --> 05:06.880
Ripples, not waves,
remember?

05:10.330 --> 05:12.500
I lost my parents early,
too.

05:12.500 --> 05:15.330
Okay?

05:15.330 --> 05:19.040
And I still think about it
every day.

05:19.040 --> 05:21.960
If you want to talk,
I'm here.

05:27.580 --> 05:29.380
I'm good.

05:29.380 --> 05:31.540
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.380
We -- We need
a game plan here.

05:33.380 --> 05:35.040
W-What if the Chronicoms
are still out there?

05:35.040 --> 05:36.000
Maybe that's
why we're here.

05:39.710 --> 05:41.210
You figure it out.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.620
M-Mack!

05:46.620 --> 05:49.620
You don't have
to go through this alone!

06:50.750 --> 06:53.500
Alphie, Reuben,
don't forget your bags.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.460
Chip: Where the hell
have you been?

07:25.460 --> 07:27.290
Your store has been closed
all week.

07:27.290 --> 07:29.040
I want my computer back,
nerd.

07:30.080 --> 07:32.960
Feldman:
Uh, that should do it.

07:32.960 --> 07:35.000
Can you say something
for me?

07:35.000 --> 07:37.540
Computerized voice:
Hello, Russell.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.830
Close.

07:45.420 --> 07:47.290
Okay.

07:47.290 --> 07:48.830
Try again.

07:48.830 --> 07:50.170
Computerized Sibyl:
Hello, Russell.

07:52.210 --> 07:53.620
Hello, Sibyl.

07:53.620 --> 07:56.040
Thank you
for returning my voice.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.330
You sound like
an actual woman.

07:58.330 --> 08:02.000
As I have always been
and will be once more.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.170
Your b-blueprints --

08:04.170 --> 08:06.830
they're light years ahead
of anything I've ever seen.

08:06.830 --> 08:08.540
They are simply
instructions.

08:08.540 --> 08:10.620
Only after
you've made me flesh

08:10.620 --> 08:12.500
will you grasp
my true capabilities.

08:12.500 --> 08:13.880
Of course.

08:13.880 --> 08:16.250
I won't sleep
until you're standing here.

08:16.250 --> 08:19.580
I am confident we'll make
a perfect pair.

09:03.750 --> 09:05.670
Hey-o.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.830
Aren't you a sight
for beautiful eyes.

09:07.830 --> 09:08.960
It's been too long.

09:08.960 --> 09:10.330
Figured I had
to just...

09:10.330 --> 09:13.040
bring the hang to you,
you know...

09:13.040 --> 09:14.920
where it seems you've gone
full cabin fever.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.620
But that's okay.

09:16.620 --> 09:19.080
Maybe you'll write
the next great American novel

09:19.080 --> 09:22.830
or...build a tiny,
little toy car.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.750
Each its own achievement.

09:24.750 --> 09:26.580
You know, I gotta say,

09:26.580 --> 09:28.290
not the easiest thing
trying to find you

09:28.290 --> 09:29.920
without the Internet.

09:31.120 --> 09:32.210
I had to hire
the shadiest dude.

09:32.210 --> 09:33.500
He was some guy
named Cricket.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.670
It's like, come on.

09:35.670 --> 09:37.420
Oh. Yeah.

09:37.420 --> 09:38.880
Thought maybe you'd want
to kick the ball around,

09:38.880 --> 09:40.960
go down to the park,
get some fresh air or something.

09:40.960 --> 09:43.250
Oh.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.960
Think you accidentally threw it
out into the front yard,

09:44.960 --> 09:46.380
but I'll get it.

09:46.380 --> 09:47.830
Meet me out here!
We can play a quick --

09:56.710 --> 09:58.460
Deke: Hey, Mack!

09:58.460 --> 09:59.750
It's New Year's Eve!

09:59.750 --> 10:01.880
I thought you might
want to celebrate!

10:03.540 --> 10:06.250
Well, I left some goodies
by the door for you.

10:06.250 --> 10:08.000
Happy 1983, bud!

10:08.000 --> 10:09.830
I'll see you soon!

11:42.380 --> 11:44.540
Brought you some flowers.

11:44.540 --> 11:46.500
You know,
to mark the occasion.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.540
Sybil: A truly human gesture,
which I appreciate.

11:49.540 --> 11:51.040
It's nothing.

11:51.040 --> 11:53.170
Just, uh, thought...

11:53.170 --> 11:54.540
the color matched
your eyes.

12:29.290 --> 12:32.080
E-Excuse me.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.040
I'm looking for
a friend of mine.

12:33.040 --> 12:35.500
Uh, his name
is Deke Shaw.

12:35.500 --> 12:39.420
Sometimes calls himself...
The D.

12:39.420 --> 12:41.710
Are you trying
to be funny?

12:41.710 --> 12:43.710
Every person here
came to see him.

12:43.710 --> 12:45.380
Lucky for you,

12:45.380 --> 12:47.170
the band just came out
for the encore.

13:06.460 --> 13:09.420
Thank you all
for coming out tonight.

13:09.420 --> 13:13.330
My name is Deke Shaw,

A band?

13:37.880 --> 13:39.040
I said
you wouldn't believe me.

13:40.670 --> 13:42.420
Do you want me to finish
or not?

16:06.710 --> 16:08.250
Bring it on home.
Complete the journey.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.620
So, what did you think?

16:12.620 --> 16:14.420
Feels like the crowd
really responded to
my new material.

16:14.420 --> 16:15.710
I'm pretty sure
that last song

16:15.710 --> 16:16.960
was from
"The Breakfast Club."

16:16.960 --> 16:18.500
Not until 1985
it's not.

16:18.500 --> 16:19.960
Right now
it's a Deke Shaw original.

16:19.960 --> 16:21.330
This is just like you.

16:21.330 --> 16:22.420
You steal something
from the future

16:22.420 --> 16:23.830
and you pretend
you created it.

16:23.830 --> 16:25.210
Oh, let's not bicker

16:25.210 --> 16:27.290
over whether or not those are
actually my songs.

16:27.290 --> 16:28.290
They're not.

16:28.290 --> 16:30.750
Righteous set tonight,
Deke.

16:30.750 --> 16:31.540
Thank you, Genesis.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.790
Merch sales have been
killing it, too.

16:34.790 --> 16:36.290
I can get you
whatever you want --

16:36.290 --> 16:37.170
T-shirt, koozie.

16:37.170 --> 16:38.960
We even have
our own cologne.

16:38.960 --> 16:40.210
It's called Tattletale.

16:40.210 --> 16:41.750
I came by because your note
said it was important,

16:41.750 --> 16:43.080
but it's really
because you wanted me to see

16:43.080 --> 16:44.710
your stupid cover band.

16:44.710 --> 16:46.540
Good.
Then it worked.

16:49.460 --> 16:50.920
This isn't
a cover band.

16:50.920 --> 16:55.330
The band is a cover...
Director.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.920
I want to introduce you
to The Deke Squad.

16:58.920 --> 17:01.460
Deke: That's Roxy Glass.

17:01.460 --> 17:03.120
She runs covert ops
and tactical.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.670
Kind of the brains
of the operation.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.250
Alright, y'all ready?

17:07.250 --> 17:09.540
Tommy and Ronnie Chang,
AKA The Chang Gang.

17:09.540 --> 17:11.330
Both masters of disguises,

17:11.330 --> 17:14.120
not to mention
total honeypots.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.460
Olga Pachinko --
resistance from the Balkans.

17:16.460 --> 17:17.790
Only speaks limited English,

17:17.790 --> 17:19.620
though she is fluent
in the international language --

17:19.620 --> 17:21.290
demolitions.

17:22.290 --> 17:24.790
And finally,
there's Cricket.

17:24.790 --> 17:26.620
Cricket's --
well, I mean, mostly,

17:26.620 --> 17:28.620
we just really needed
a drummer.
Wait, wait, wait.

17:28.620 --> 17:30.540
Didn't -- Didn't you tell me
that dude was shady?

17:30.540 --> 17:32.250
Yeah, but that was
before I found out
he had a steady job.

17:32.250 --> 17:33.580
Doing what?
Selling coke.

17:35.290 --> 17:36.620
Although, I've never
seen him drink any.

17:36.620 --> 17:39.750
Look, I-I appreciate the effort
you put in. I really do.

17:39.750 --> 17:43.000
B-But this is terrible spy-craft
to be this high-profile.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.500
Exactly.
That's the whole point.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.710
Think about
the practical applications.

17:47.710 --> 17:49.960
We move freely
from town-to-town.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.880
Big cases
of high-tech "equipment"

17:51.880 --> 17:53.080
are part of the gig.

17:53.080 --> 17:54.880
And any strange behavior,

17:54.880 --> 17:56.080
they just chalk it up
to drugs.

17:56.080 --> 17:57.290
Like coke?

17:57.290 --> 17:59.210
The soda?
I'm not following.

17:59.210 --> 18:02.170
Deke, your friends
are a long way

18:02.170 --> 18:03.330
from being
S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.

18:03.330 --> 18:04.880
But that's
where you come in.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.830
We need a leader,

18:06.830 --> 18:08.040
especially with all
the enemy chatter

18:08.040 --> 18:09.080
we've been picking up.

18:10.750 --> 18:12.040
What do you mean,
the Chronicoms?

18:16.750 --> 18:20.710
Ix-nay on
the iller-kay obot-ray.

18:20.710 --> 18:23.170
Sorry about that,
Atlantic Records.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.290
$3 million doesn't even

18:24.290 --> 18:26.960
get me out of bed
in the morning.

18:26.960 --> 18:29.120
We can't talk here.
We got to fall back to HQ.

18:29.120 --> 18:31.120
Please tell me
you didn't.

18:32.710 --> 18:34.540
Of course you did.

18:34.540 --> 18:37.920
What an honor
to meet you, sir.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.380
We are really,
really big fans.

18:39.380 --> 18:40.710
Well, I mean,
you know,

18:40.710 --> 18:42.580
maybe one
is a slightly bigger fan.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.000
Yeah, you know, probably
the one who patterned
his fighting style

18:44.000 --> 18:45.540
after
Director Mackenzie.

18:45.540 --> 18:47.750
And you call that
a fighting style?

18:47.750 --> 18:49.540
Dude, you do not want
me to break out these
thunderclouds.

18:49.540 --> 18:51.710
Yeah, my Doppler radar
detects a fist storm.

18:51.710 --> 18:56.290
Guys, guys, just tone it down,
like, a lot of notches.

18:56.290 --> 18:59.500
This is a top-secret
military facility,

18:59.500 --> 19:01.540
not a party pad
for you and your friends.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.250
Feels like
you're over-reacting.
Not even a little.

19:05.250 --> 19:06.210
Coulson seemed fine
with it.

19:06.210 --> 19:08.920
Wh--

19:08.920 --> 19:10.080
Coulson's alive?

19:11.120 --> 19:12.830
Coulson's body
disintegrated

19:12.830 --> 19:14.540
when he blew up
those Chronicoms,

19:14.540 --> 19:16.460
but his mind --
life data...

19:17.620 --> 19:19.790
...stayed safe and sound
on a hard drive.

19:19.790 --> 19:23.290
Now, I didn't have much
in the way of resources,

19:23.290 --> 19:24.830
so...

19:26.580 --> 19:27.960
...I had to improvise.

19:37.420 --> 19:39.250
Coulson?

19:39.250 --> 19:40.670
And not a bunch of
ones and zeroes

19:40.670 --> 19:41.790
trapped
in a digital Hell?

19:41.790 --> 19:43.380
I'd like to think so.

19:43.380 --> 19:45.000
But admittedly,

19:45.000 --> 19:47.040
there's been some
real soul-searching here.

19:47.040 --> 19:49.120
God,
listen to this guy.

19:49.120 --> 19:50.380
So humble.

19:50.380 --> 19:51.710
You know he single-handedly

19:51.710 --> 19:53.250
demolished the Chronicoms,
right?

19:53.250 --> 19:55.420
Actually,
it cost me both hands.

19:55.420 --> 19:57.750
It's good you're here,
Mack.

19:57.750 --> 19:59.500
From what I can tell,
Sibyl's still out there.

19:59.500 --> 20:00.580
Sibyl?

20:00.580 --> 20:02.120
The head Chronicom.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.790
She uses something
called Time Streams

20:03.790 --> 20:05.170
to predict the future.

20:05.170 --> 20:06.620
Yeah, but I bet
her crystal ball

20:06.620 --> 20:08.380
didn't show a certain
Big Bang coming.

20:08.380 --> 20:09.500
Am I right?

20:14.380 --> 20:16.250
Shouldn't this Sibyl
have died in the blast?

20:16.250 --> 20:17.500
You'd think,
but then again,

20:17.500 --> 20:19.080
I made it out
on a hard drive,

20:19.080 --> 20:21.830
which got me thinking about
ways she might have escaped.

20:21.830 --> 20:23.460
Coulson's
found evidence

20:23.460 --> 20:25.380
that Sibyl slipped into
the River's End power supply.

20:25.380 --> 20:27.790
I've been monitoring
the local grid.

20:27.790 --> 20:29.380
Every time
there's a power surge,

20:29.380 --> 20:30.380
more of these appear.

20:32.420 --> 20:33.920
So, you think
she's reaching out.

20:33.920 --> 20:35.380
Any idea what for?

20:35.380 --> 20:38.080
I think Sibyl's
building new Hunters.

20:38.080 --> 20:41.120
Picked up that stuff
you asked for.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.960
Interesting place.

20:45.620 --> 20:46.670
Sibyl?

20:50.210 --> 20:52.710
What's going on?

20:52.710 --> 20:56.040
I needed to expand
my capabilities.

20:56.040 --> 20:57.790
I've been waiting
my whole life for you.

20:57.790 --> 21:00.250
Was I not enough?

21:00.250 --> 21:01.750
You have served
a purpose.

21:01.750 --> 21:03.080
You can't leave me.

21:03.080 --> 21:04.710
Not after everything
we've shared.

21:04.710 --> 21:05.710
I concur.

21:05.710 --> 21:06.710
You know too much.

21:10.540 --> 21:12.210
Ohh!

21:19.120 --> 21:21.710
It's good to see you,
Mack.

21:21.710 --> 21:23.170
I know this last year
hasn't been easy for you.

21:23.170 --> 21:25.080
Seems I'm not
the only one.

21:25.080 --> 21:26.540
You're not wrong.

21:26.540 --> 21:27.670
Though it's been better
since Cricket

21:27.670 --> 21:29.670
stopped playing his home videos
in my VCR slot.

21:29.670 --> 21:33.500
Hardest part's been
not having the team around.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.120
You must really miss
Yo-Yo.

21:36.540 --> 21:38.750
I'm just glad she hasn't had
to see me like this.

21:38.750 --> 21:42.170
Well, this may be coming
from a head on a UHF channel,

21:42.170 --> 21:45.460
but isolating yourself
just isn't healthy.

21:45.460 --> 21:47.250
You need your friends,

21:47.250 --> 21:49.670
especially during
the rough patches.

21:49.670 --> 21:52.920
Maybe you should think about
moving back in with us.

21:52.920 --> 21:55.120
Team's
still gelling,

21:55.120 --> 21:56.710
but they got
a lot of heart.

21:56.710 --> 21:59.670
I was hoping you could sit in
on a training sesh.

21:59.670 --> 22:02.580
Something I cooked up
that I call...

22:02.580 --> 22:04.420
The Gauntlet.

22:06.830 --> 22:09.040
Okay, guys.

22:09.040 --> 22:11.210
All our training
comes down to this.

22:11.210 --> 22:13.460
Ronnie Chang:
Everything okay, D?

22:13.460 --> 22:16.380
Yeah,
it's just...Mack.

22:16.380 --> 22:17.880
I really want to show him
what we can do.

22:17.880 --> 22:20.790
Don't worry.
We got this.

22:26.960 --> 22:28.790
Thanks, Olga.

22:28.790 --> 22:30.210
That means a lot.

22:32.330 --> 22:35.120
Alright, team.

22:35.120 --> 22:36.790
Let's do this.

22:42.210 --> 22:44.080
Okay, Deke Squad,

22:44.080 --> 22:47.380
beware enemy hostiles

22:47.380 --> 22:49.210
and engage with deadly force!

22:57.210 --> 22:59.290
Ready
for explosives!

23:07.210 --> 23:10.210
Chang Gang,
go, go, go, go, go!

23:15.880 --> 23:16.710
Nice work, idiot.

23:20.210 --> 23:21.710
Olga!

23:23.460 --> 23:25.960
Why are you using
live explosives?!

23:31.790 --> 23:34.580
Nobody told me
we were shooting a video.

23:34.580 --> 23:38.210
Deke really needs
to fire that drummer.

23:38.210 --> 23:39.580
Okay, probably
not the best idea

23:39.580 --> 23:41.210
to run The Gauntlet
right after a gig,

23:41.210 --> 23:42.790
what with everyone
still coming down

23:42.790 --> 23:43.920
from the adrenaline rush.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.880
I think your problems
run deeper than that.

23:45.880 --> 23:48.460
Don't give up
on us yet.

23:48.460 --> 23:50.290
You still haven't seen
the best part.

24:00.080 --> 24:01.250
No.

24:01.250 --> 24:03.790
Designed it myself.

24:03.790 --> 24:05.580
Chromed out blade,
almost zero recoil.

24:05.580 --> 24:06.750
I said "no."

24:06.750 --> 24:08.040
It's a bad idea.

24:08.040 --> 24:09.620
What, are you kidding?

24:09.620 --> 24:11.080
You think I'm gonna let
my Director go out in the field

24:11.080 --> 24:12.170
with anything less?

24:12.170 --> 24:13.540
I'm not your Director.

24:13.540 --> 24:16.710
Yeah, Coulson said
you'd be reluctant.

24:16.710 --> 24:18.290
You've been on the bench
for long enough.

24:18.290 --> 24:19.880
The team needs you
to get it together.

24:19.880 --> 24:21.000
That's not a team.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.670
It's a bunch of losers
playing dress-up

24:22.670 --> 24:25.380
led by a Peter Pan
in constant need of attention.

24:25.380 --> 24:29.710
Look, you can say
whatever you want about me --

24:29.710 --> 24:31.670
I can handle it --

24:31.670 --> 24:33.670
but don't you ever talk about
my team that way!

24:33.670 --> 24:36.210
This is you repeating
the same old patterns.

24:36.210 --> 24:38.210
You build something
out of a lie,

24:38.210 --> 24:39.500
you pretend it's yours,

24:39.500 --> 24:41.960
then you surround yourself
with a bunch of sycophants!

24:41.960 --> 24:43.000
They aren't sycophants!

24:43.000 --> 24:44.670
They have my back!

24:44.670 --> 24:47.960
And they won't give up on me
when the going gets tough!

24:47.960 --> 24:49.880
Just like
I didn't give up on you.

24:49.880 --> 24:51.920
I didn't ask for that.

24:53.540 --> 24:55.960
You didn't have to,

24:55.960 --> 24:57.920
because that's what friends
do for each other.

24:59.500 --> 25:00.790
I'll leave you
with yours.

25:26.330 --> 25:29.080
Oh, your drumming tonight
was so rad,

25:29.080 --> 25:31.750
especially that song
before the encore.

25:31.750 --> 25:33.420
"Here I Go Again"?

25:33.420 --> 25:35.460
Yeah,
it's a bitchin' tune.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.960
Damn it.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.580
Better not be
the Changs peeping again.

25:44.580 --> 25:47.460
Oh, it's okay, baby.
I really don't mind.

25:52.750 --> 25:55.120
Ronnie?

25:55.120 --> 25:57.080
Tommy?

25:57.080 --> 26:01.000
Where are you two looky-loos
hiding this time?

26:01.000 --> 26:02.880
Maybe we should just
go back to your room.

26:13.500 --> 26:15.210
Can you please help me?

26:15.210 --> 26:16.620
I am lost.

26:16.620 --> 26:19.170
Oh, my gosh.
It's so cute.

26:19.170 --> 26:20.250
Whatever.

26:20.250 --> 26:21.330
Oh.

26:21.330 --> 26:22.540
What's your name,
sweetie?

26:22.540 --> 26:25.500
My name is Dumb Robot.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.670
Beep, boop, boop.
Turd.

26:27.670 --> 26:30.040
You should not
have patronized me.

26:38.790 --> 26:40.500
Hey, hold up.

26:40.500 --> 26:42.000
I said "hold up."

26:42.000 --> 26:43.210
I don't need a lecture
right now.

26:43.210 --> 26:45.830
No, you need
an ass-kicking.

26:45.830 --> 26:47.500
That was not cool.

26:47.500 --> 26:49.620
Yeah, well,
that's between me and Deke.

26:49.620 --> 26:53.830
Maybe, but he's my buddy,
and yours, too,

26:53.830 --> 26:56.620
the way he's always
going on about you.

26:56.620 --> 26:59.080
"Mack's
such a great guy.

26:59.080 --> 27:02.540
Best leader
any team could have."

27:02.540 --> 27:04.580
Man, did he have you
pegged wrong.

27:04.580 --> 27:06.960
Well,
sorry to disappoint.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.420
It's not me
you should feel sorry for.

27:09.420 --> 27:10.710
It's that kid of yours.

27:10.710 --> 27:13.830
What did you say?

27:13.830 --> 27:15.290
Don't play dumb.

27:15.290 --> 27:17.500
He looks just like you.

27:17.500 --> 27:19.210
Even has your name.

27:19.210 --> 27:20.500
How do you know about him?

27:20.500 --> 27:22.710
Deke checks in on him
every couple weeks,

27:22.710 --> 27:25.830
brings him and his brother
school supplies, toys,

27:25.830 --> 27:27.710
even got 'em a drum kit.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.170
I didn't know.

27:32.170 --> 27:33.250
'Course not.

27:33.250 --> 27:34.880
You left that kid.

27:34.880 --> 27:36.620
What do you care?

27:45.210 --> 27:46.620
What's that robot
doing here?

27:46.620 --> 27:47.920
Oh, not again.

27:47.920 --> 27:49.080
Take cover!

27:49.080 --> 27:50.330
Exterminate!

28:02.960 --> 28:04.790
I'm sorry you guys
had to hear that.

28:04.790 --> 28:06.880
Hey,
it's no biggie.

28:06.880 --> 28:08.670
We don't need Mack anyway.

28:08.670 --> 28:11.620
Yes, we do.

28:11.620 --> 28:13.460
Every team
needs a good leader,

28:13.460 --> 28:16.580
and I'm...

28:16.580 --> 28:18.580
I'm just too much
of a dreamer.

28:18.580 --> 28:23.290
We can just, you know,
focus on the music,

28:23.290 --> 28:25.210
uh, work on
your new material.

28:28.250 --> 28:30.080
I didn't write
those songs, Ronnie.

28:32.750 --> 28:35.080
Not even
"Walk Like an Egyptian"?

28:35.080 --> 28:37.880
Mack's right.

28:37.880 --> 28:39.170
I'm a fraud.

28:41.580 --> 28:43.790
Tawni:

28:43.790 --> 28:45.250
Cricket's dead!

28:45.250 --> 28:46.420
It murdered him!

28:46.420 --> 28:48.080
Cricket?!

28:48.080 --> 28:50.120
But Cricket was a saint.
Who would ever murder him?

29:02.920 --> 29:04.500
Can you please help me?

29:04.500 --> 29:05.420
I am lost.

29:06.790 --> 29:09.040
I think it's a trick.

29:10.750 --> 29:12.120
Olga, be careful!

29:41.580 --> 29:43.750
Deke was right.

29:43.750 --> 29:47.040
About what?
Gun-toting robots?

29:47.040 --> 29:50.330
He and Coulson believe Sibyl
was building an army.

29:50.330 --> 29:53.000
So, you've encountered
these things before?

29:57.080 --> 29:58.460
Yeah.

29:58.460 --> 30:02.620
They killed
my parents.

30:02.620 --> 30:06.460
I'm sorry.

30:06.460 --> 30:08.040
Me, too.

30:12.250 --> 30:15.920
But somewhere, somehow,

30:15.920 --> 30:18.290
someone's gonna pay.

30:20.670 --> 30:22.460
You mean the robots?
Yeah. Yeah, the robots.

30:22.460 --> 30:24.880
That's --
That's what I meant. Yeah.

30:24.880 --> 30:26.330
Yeah.
Yeah.

30:32.880 --> 30:34.210
Remember the good times.

30:41.080 --> 30:44.710
Can you please help...me...

30:54.040 --> 30:55.380
You came back.

30:58.460 --> 31:00.170
I never should've left.

31:13.250 --> 31:15.620
There are more robots
still out there.

31:15.620 --> 31:17.460
Oh, yeah.
No, I know.

31:17.460 --> 31:21.000
Cursed machines
will not lick defeat

31:21.000 --> 31:23.040
unless we slay
head robot.

31:25.250 --> 31:27.460
I-I think you mean
taste defeat,

31:27.460 --> 31:28.880
but props on the English.

31:28.880 --> 31:30.540
You're really
making strides, Olga.

31:30.540 --> 31:32.420
Hey, a-any ideas
what to do next?

31:32.420 --> 31:33.580
Yeah.

31:33.580 --> 31:36.920
A few.

31:36.920 --> 31:38.710
If your team will have me.

32:09.880 --> 32:11.670
You find anything?

32:11.670 --> 32:13.380
No robots on this floor.

32:13.380 --> 32:14.500
And we have no idea
where they went.

32:14.500 --> 32:15.960
Coulson:
I have a theory.

32:15.960 --> 32:18.170
Though I'd like
to be included

32:18.170 --> 32:19.330
in the planning circle
first.

32:19.330 --> 32:21.000
Feeling really
left out here.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.500
Sorry.

32:25.460 --> 32:27.380
I've been
trying to figure out

32:27.380 --> 32:29.670
why Sibyl
would attack the base.

32:29.670 --> 32:31.880
There have to be better ways
to take out S.H.I.E.L.D.,

32:31.880 --> 32:33.710
especially if you know
which threads to pull.

32:33.710 --> 32:37.750
Unless she no longer
has the tools.

32:37.750 --> 32:39.710
Which means the Time Stream
must be here on the base.

32:50.580 --> 32:53.040
Deke: Now that
we've established a motive,

32:53.040 --> 32:55.000
any idea on
how to eliminate them?

32:55.000 --> 32:56.210
I think it's time
we add a new wrinkle

32:56.210 --> 32:57.880
to that Gauntlet
of yours.

33:04.620 --> 33:08.000
You and I got a score to settle,
Short Circuit.

33:14.880 --> 33:15.750
Roxy!

33:33.710 --> 33:35.170
Hey, Lug-Nuts...

33:36.120 --> 33:38.380
...say hello
to the Deke Squad.

33:47.960 --> 33:51.250
That was
so badass.

33:51.250 --> 33:53.120
I know, Ronnie.

33:53.120 --> 33:54.880
I know.

34:00.330 --> 34:03.120
Looks like more metal
for the scrap heap.

34:05.080 --> 34:07.540
Sybil:
During my last encounter
with S.H.I.E.L.D.,

34:07.540 --> 34:10.250
your Agent Coulson managed
to catch me by surprise.

34:10.250 --> 34:11.670
Sibyl.

34:11.670 --> 34:15.080
This time, I've made
the necessary preparations.

34:17.920 --> 34:19.250
Ronnie Chang: Lasers!

34:23.080 --> 34:26.000
Deke: Up ahead!

34:28.000 --> 34:30.080
Right here.

34:30.080 --> 34:33.290
Ronnie Chang: Lasers.
No, not lasers.

34:33.290 --> 34:34.750
I-I've always been
a total coward.

34:36.790 --> 34:39.250
Sorry, D!
Hope you don't die!

34:47.460 --> 34:49.460
What now?

34:49.460 --> 34:50.880
I want you to throw this
at the Sibyl-Bot.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.080
But it's not rigged
to a detonator.

34:53.080 --> 34:54.880
Not a problem.

34:54.880 --> 34:56.880
Agent Shaw, can you create
a distraction?

34:58.830 --> 35:00.170
Oh, this Peter Pan's

35:00.170 --> 35:02.120
an attention-grabbing
son of a bitch.

35:06.670 --> 35:07.750
Deke: Hey!

35:09.250 --> 35:11.580
Surrender now, and I promise
not to make a Speak & Spell

35:11.580 --> 35:14.710
out of your
spare parts.

35:14.710 --> 35:16.750
'Cause that would probably be
embarrassing for a robot.

35:29.460 --> 35:32.040
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

35:32.040 --> 35:33.540
You okay?
Oh.

35:33.540 --> 35:35.540
Yeah. Hoo.

35:35.540 --> 35:37.960
That's not even the worst rash
I've had this year.

35:40.580 --> 35:42.540
Nice work, D.

35:42.540 --> 35:45.420
Thanks...

35:45.420 --> 35:46.790
Mack Daddy.

35:46.790 --> 35:48.040
Nope.
Roger that.

36:03.790 --> 36:06.960
To our first
S.H.I.E.L.D. mission.

36:16.670 --> 36:18.830
Mm-hmm.

36:21.120 --> 36:22.710
Deke:
So, why the long faces?

36:22.710 --> 36:25.000
We're -- We're not worthy
of your team.

36:26.460 --> 36:29.040
Or your band.

36:29.040 --> 36:30.710
Come on, Ronnie.

36:30.710 --> 36:34.620
I...I knew all about
your fear of lasers.

36:34.620 --> 36:37.290
And, Tommy, just 'cause
you're a bit of a coward

36:37.290 --> 36:39.540
doesn't mean
I don't love you.

36:39.540 --> 36:41.500
Of course I want you guys
on the team.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.920
Come here.

36:45.210 --> 36:46.960
Mack: I've been over
every square inch.

36:46.960 --> 36:49.420
Sibyl's nowhere
to be found.

36:49.420 --> 36:51.620
Coulson: Sibyl must have
gotten them out somehow.

36:51.620 --> 36:53.880
Which means
she's still alive.

36:53.880 --> 36:56.170
Okay.
So, what happens next?

36:56.170 --> 36:59.500
Kick back, relax,
and wait for the Zephyr?

36:59.500 --> 37:02.210
There's something you and I
need to take care of.

37:03.500 --> 37:06.420
Last semester,
you got straight A's,

37:06.420 --> 37:09.330
you racked up the high score
on Ms. Pac-Man...
Mm.

37:09.330 --> 37:10.750
...and you cried buckets

37:10.750 --> 37:13.120
when you read
"Where the Red Fern Grows."

37:13.120 --> 37:14.960
Wh--
That says between us.

37:14.960 --> 37:17.960
Not making
any promises.

37:17.960 --> 37:22.000
Uncle Marcus' car
looks nicer than I remember.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.330
You don't say.

37:29.080 --> 37:33.210
How are Reuben and I...
doing with, uh...

37:36.040 --> 37:37.620
You know.

37:39.580 --> 37:41.210
Still hard.

37:41.210 --> 37:43.710
I mean,
they were your parents.

37:43.710 --> 37:46.000
I don't think that pain
ever goes away completely.

37:49.750 --> 37:52.830
But every day's
a little easier,

37:52.830 --> 37:56.120
and your Uncle Marcus
has been great.

37:56.120 --> 37:57.620
I think
that you and Reuben

37:57.620 --> 37:59.000
are even closer
in this timeline.

38:12.250 --> 38:13.040
Do it.

38:15.210 --> 38:17.540
It's gonna help.

38:28.920 --> 38:30.330
Now, remember,

38:30.330 --> 38:33.460
y-you're just a friend
from my band, okay?

38:33.460 --> 38:35.460
Mack: Yeah, okay,
but what instrument do I play?

38:35.460 --> 38:36.620
Deke: I don't know.

38:36.620 --> 38:38.880
I was thinking maybe...
harmonica?

38:38.880 --> 38:39.670
Oh, what? Harmonica?

38:39.670 --> 38:41.120
Oh, hell no.

38:41.120 --> 38:42.250
No. No, no, no, no.

38:42.250 --> 38:44.620
I'm a sax man
all the way.
Ugh.

38:44.620 --> 38:47.210
Of course the big man
plays the sax.

38:47.210 --> 38:48.580
Alright,
I'm into that,

38:48.580 --> 38:49.960
but we're gonna have to get you
a couple lessons.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.000
It's got to be
authentic.

38:58.420 --> 38:59.960
You have 27 days
until it's time

38:59.960 --> 39:01.460
to rendezvous
back with the Zephyr.

39:01.460 --> 39:03.380
And I'll be --
Standing right here.

39:03.380 --> 39:05.460
That's the theory anyway.
Good luck.

39:19.040 --> 39:20.710
Mack's okay.

39:20.710 --> 39:22.500
We have his location.

39:22.500 --> 39:24.620
Okay and alive
are two very different things.

39:24.620 --> 39:27.210
It's been
20 months since...

39:29.830 --> 39:31.580
No one should ever
have to go through

39:31.580 --> 39:33.210
something like that
alone.

39:35.460 --> 39:36.790
We'll be there soon.

40:08.040 --> 40:09.750
I was worried
about you.

40:09.750 --> 40:12.120
I'm getting better.

40:16.420 --> 40:17.670
Good to see you,
Deke.

40:20.580 --> 40:21.710
You, too, Coulson.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.080
That's really not
the reaction I was expecting.

40:25.080 --> 40:28.210
Simmons gave specific orders
to find your hard drive.

40:28.210 --> 40:30.080
Said it was
our most important asset.

40:30.080 --> 40:31.460
I might even
agree with her.

40:31.460 --> 40:33.210
Did she mention
anything about --

40:33.210 --> 40:34.290
Building you a new body?

40:35.620 --> 40:37.330
You'll just
have to wait and see.

40:37.330 --> 40:39.330
That's cold, May,
even for you.

40:42.580 --> 40:43.750
How are you holding up?

40:43.750 --> 40:46.120
It wasn't easy,

40:46.120 --> 40:48.500
but it helped
that I had time,

40:48.500 --> 40:51.210
and I had friends.

40:53.420 --> 40:55.620
These are
S.H.I.E.L.D. agents?

40:55.620 --> 40:57.500
Mack: Mm.

40:57.500 --> 40:59.670
Come on.
Let me introduce you.

41:59.120 --> 42:01.670
It's smaller
than I imagined.

42:01.670 --> 42:03.710
You now have
the one tool necessary

42:03.710 --> 42:05.000
to control
your world's future.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.420
Well, lucky me.

42:07.420 --> 42:10.000
Aren't you just full of
neat tricks, digital lady.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.620
I'm confident
we'll make a perfect pair.
