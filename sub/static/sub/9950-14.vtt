'Comes a time in a man's life
where he has to sit back,

00:08.725 --> 00:12.725
'take stock of things and ponder
that old philosophical chestnut -

00:13.645 --> 00:17.645
'how the fuck did I end up here?'

'I'll tell you who's to blame

'Y'ask me, that shows initiative.

time off for good behaviour.'

00:43.245 --> 00:45.083
Gallagher!

00:45.085 --> 00:49.085
What?

00:49.965 --> 00:53.965
'Or an extra three

Y'know, you miss the simple things.

01:33.285 --> 01:37.285
S'all right. Too much peace
and not enough war.

01:39.725 --> 01:41.363
Time, Frank.

01:41.365 --> 01:45.365
See ya.

01:51.205 --> 01:55.205
Be a good lad, Frank.
Head straight home.

Frank?

'And straight back into another?'

02:22.245 --> 02:24.643
She looks familiar.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.883
Mavis? Margaret?

02:26.885 --> 02:29.403
Oh, no, no, wait, wait -
Monica, innit?

02:29.405 --> 02:32.643
I remember you. Been a while.

02:32.645 --> 02:35.283
Three months
since you last bothered to visit.

02:35.285 --> 02:39.285
I thought you might want
some space.

02:41.165 --> 02:43.405
I've brought you some fags
and a can.

02:45.325 --> 02:49.325
They're in the car.

02:49.645 --> 02:51.683
You look well.

02:51.685 --> 02:53.043
You don't.

02:53.045 --> 02:55.603
I know you've been round the block
a bit, Monica, y'know,

02:55.605 --> 02:57.885
but just a shame you didn't
jog round it.

02:59.245 --> 03:01.843
Just a bloody joke!

03:01.845 --> 03:03.203
Been an emotional time.

03:03.205 --> 03:04.723
Well, yeah, course.

03:04.725 --> 03:06.603
Most societal structures collapse

03:06.605 --> 03:10.605
when the patriarchal figure
is removed.

03:16.085 --> 03:17.243
Frank?

03:17.245 --> 03:21.083
I had a lot of hopes and dreams
when I was your age.

03:21.085 --> 03:23.923
Places I wanted to go.
Things I wanted to do.

03:23.925 --> 03:26.043
Ambition.

03:26.045 --> 03:30.045
None of 'em involved
growing a fuckin' moustache.

03:33.725 --> 03:34.803
So, where to?

03:34.805 --> 03:35.603
Pub.

03:35.605 --> 03:39.605
Home.

03:39.765 --> 03:43.765
Home it is.

03:51.645 --> 03:55.243
All right, Frank.
Enjoy your holiday?

03:55.245 --> 03:57.563
I've had worse. You've been busy.

03:57.565 --> 04:00.003
Well, I'm not the only one.

04:00.005 --> 04:02.203
Come on. Let's get you inside.

04:02.205 --> 04:04.643
All right, all right...
what's the rush?

04:04.645 --> 04:07.803
Oh. I know what's going on.

04:07.805 --> 04:11.805
You do?

04:17.845 --> 04:21.845
Pa-a-arty!

04:22.765 --> 04:26.765
Dad!

04:27.205 --> 04:31.205
Yeah, hi. Where's everybody else?

04:38.125 --> 04:40.923
This is my maths test.

04:40.925 --> 04:43.843
This is my English.

04:43.845 --> 04:46.043
And this is art.

04:46.045 --> 04:50.045
Right, lovely.

04:51.325 --> 04:54.763
What, is this you? Crying because
your daddy's all banged up?

04:54.765 --> 04:58.765
No. That's Jesus. He's upset
because you did a bad thing.

05:00.045 --> 05:02.923
Yeah... well, bit judgmental
of the lad.

05:02.925 --> 05:05.643
I mean, he's never had to struggle.
No wife, no kids

05:05.645 --> 05:09.003
and his dad was God.
Silver spoon up the arse, that one.

05:09.005 --> 05:12.363
She did really want to visit you
more. It's just Monica's all...

05:12.365 --> 05:13.643
y'know...

05:13.645 --> 05:14.443
Monica's what?

05:14.445 --> 05:16.683
Got burning ears, apparently.

05:16.685 --> 05:17.683
Monica!

05:17.685 --> 05:21.643
Hey - Jockey's open now.
Free man deserves a drink, eh?

05:21.645 --> 05:23.923
Thought you'd never ask.

05:23.925 --> 05:25.363
Are you coming back?

05:25.365 --> 05:29.365
Back on all fours, hopefully.

05:29.885 --> 05:30.923
Monica!

05:30.925 --> 05:34.925
That couple of drinks will soften
the blow.

05:39.365 --> 05:43.365
Come on, shift it.

05:50.325 --> 05:54.323
Frank, once you get a drink, there's
something we've got to talk about.

05:54.325 --> 05:58.325
Oh, don't ruin the moment, Mon.
Calm before the proverbial storm.

05:59.805 --> 06:03.805
Wait for it. Wait for it...

06:04.725 --> 06:08.725
Pa-a-a-arty!

06:11.805 --> 06:15.123
13.40.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.963
So what, we're early?

06:16.965 --> 06:18.363
Pounds. Your tab.

06:18.365 --> 06:21.523
Plus interest for every month
when it wasn't paid, so...

06:21.525 --> 06:24.483
call it 20. You got done.
Don't expect a reward.

06:24.485 --> 06:27.003
Expect? It's my right as a free man.
I want my party!

06:27.005 --> 06:29.763
Oh, for God's sake, Frank,
I'll buy you a drink...

06:29.765 --> 06:31.683
A drink? No, no, no.

06:31.685 --> 06:35.083
I don't want a drink, I want
parades, banners, dancing fucking

06:35.085 --> 06:39.085
elephants! But no, you couldn't do
that for me, that one little thing!

06:42.045 --> 06:44.923
When's my time, Mon?
When's my fucking party?

06:44.925 --> 06:48.083
Frank... Ohh!

06:48.085 --> 06:52.085
Oh, yeah. That's guilt, that is.
Eating away at you.

06:53.805 --> 06:57.283
Yeah, and that's... y'know...
pissing yourself because...

06:57.285 --> 06:58.203
well... the same.

06:58.205 --> 06:59.803
Fuck's sake, Frank!

06:59.805 --> 07:02.283
She's having a baby, you idiot!

07:02.285 --> 07:03.323
No, she's not!

07:03.325 --> 07:05.123
We can't!

07:05.125 --> 07:08.363
I know. And I'm going to deal
with it. I promise you.

07:08.365 --> 07:10.923
Family's big enough.
There'll be no more.

07:10.925 --> 07:13.323
She had an abortion!

07:13.325 --> 07:14.363
I was going to tell you,

07:14.365 --> 07:18.365
but it wasn't the... it wasn't
the right time...

07:18.765 --> 07:22.243
It's a bit late now! You promised,
you fucking promised me...

07:22.245 --> 07:23.963
I did, I had the abortion!

07:23.965 --> 07:27.163
Well, if you had the abortion, what
the bloody hell's that? Tapeworm?

07:27.165 --> 07:30.723
It were twins.
One of them survived...

07:30.725 --> 07:33.763
Frank! She's having a baby right
now, whether you like it or not.

07:33.765 --> 07:35.763
So go and get hot water
and towels. Move it!

07:35.765 --> 07:37.563
Got her fuckin' claws in me...

07:37.565 --> 07:38.885
Bloody hell!

07:40.525 --> 07:44.525
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.083
Aagh!

07:46.085 --> 07:50.085
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

07:50.325 --> 07:52.443
All right, all right.

07:52.445 --> 07:53.763
Don't worry.

07:53.765 --> 07:56.723
We'll sue them, for benefits,
clothing allowance,

07:56.725 --> 07:59.323
room and board, everything.
They fucked up.

07:59.325 --> 08:02.203
This is the NHS's baby, not ours.
Might even make a profit...

08:02.205 --> 08:04.043
I didn't have it on the NHS.

08:04.045 --> 08:08.045
I wanted to have it holistically,
so I saw this lovely woman,

08:08.405 --> 08:11.403
Linda Wallace, she said
she's part-Cherokee

08:11.405 --> 08:14.723
and she said that it was
a more natural way...

08:14.725 --> 08:16.603
Ohh, f...

08:16.605 --> 08:20.605
Scalding bath and a bottle of gin,
a one-way trip down the staircase,

08:21.005 --> 08:25.005
but no, you had to go
and visit Gypsy Rose fucking Lee!

08:25.325 --> 08:27.643
She's Cherokee, not Romany!

08:27.645 --> 08:30.523
She comes from bloody
Southend-on-Sea!

08:30.525 --> 08:32.164
Come on, Mon, you push now...

08:37.325 --> 08:41.044
Come on, son, you can do it!
You're a survivor!

08:49.165 --> 08:52.685
Monica. Monica!

08:54.205 --> 08:56.363
Nothing personal. It's just...

08:56.365 --> 09:00.365
had plans for you.
Not-being-born plans.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.603
What's with the fancy dress?

09:03.605 --> 09:05.043
Going for ice cream.

09:05.045 --> 09:08.203
Oh, no, no, you lot have got
a baby to look after.

09:08.205 --> 09:09.963
I can't do it all myself.

09:09.965 --> 09:12.123
It's his birthday.

09:12.125 --> 09:13.003
Eighteen.

09:13.005 --> 09:14.803
Oh, so you've come of age.

09:14.805 --> 09:18.763
Which means we don't get child
benefit to look after you any more.

09:18.765 --> 09:20.163
No.

09:20.165 --> 09:24.165
Great. Another fuckin'
waste of space, leeching off us.

09:26.125 --> 09:28.163
Gotta do something about her, Frank.

09:28.165 --> 09:32.165
She's not left her room all week.
You need an extra pair of hands.

09:38.405 --> 09:41.005
S'all right, s'all right.

09:44.445 --> 09:48.445
Are you planning on rejoining
society any time soon?

09:51.565 --> 09:54.363
I've killed a baby, Frank.

09:54.365 --> 09:57.683
I've snuffed out
a tiny little light.

09:57.685 --> 09:59.403
Do you know how that feels?

09:59.405 --> 10:02.003
It wasn't a baby.
It was barely even a foetus.

10:02.005 --> 10:04.805
I've coughed up stuff
with more personality.

10:06.205 --> 10:10.205
That - that, downstairs, with
lungs like Pavarotti, that's a baby.

10:11.725 --> 10:14.203
It's been a week
since you've even glanced at him.

10:14.205 --> 10:15.883
I've got post-natal...

10:15.885 --> 10:18.163
Oh, every time, post-natal,
pre-natal,

10:18.165 --> 10:21.923
it's always excuses with you, Mon.

10:21.925 --> 10:25.925
How can I hold that baby, knowing
what I've done to his brother?

10:26.405 --> 10:30.405
Knowing what I've taken from him?

10:30.605 --> 10:34.605
They would have been besties.
They would've dressed the same.

10:34.925 --> 10:37.843
They would've got into all
kinds of scrapes. Bill and Ben.

10:37.845 --> 10:41.403
The fabulous Gallagher boys.

10:41.405 --> 10:45.405
Please, please, please, please,
forgive me. Please, forgive me.

10:47.645 --> 10:49.883
Please, please...

10:49.885 --> 10:53.723
This isn't even your kid, this is
the bloody Oxfam Africa baby!

10:53.725 --> 10:56.243
There's no need to be racist!

10:56.245 --> 11:00.245
No, I told you - no more kids.
You made the choice

11:00.325 --> 11:03.683
and you are not making me take care
of another fucking child alone.

11:03.685 --> 11:07.443
So whatever you think this...
this fucking Christmas tree

11:07.445 --> 11:11.243
is for, whatever help
you think it's giving you -

11:11.245 --> 11:15.245
it's clearly not enough, is it?

11:18.005 --> 11:22.005
You're right. It's not.

11:22.685 --> 11:26.523
We need to have a funeral
for little Bill.

11:26.525 --> 11:30.525
Go down to Ches's and get some
fizzy wine. Decent stuff.

11:32.205 --> 11:35.843
And what are you gonna do?

11:35.845 --> 11:37.403
There's lots to organise.

11:37.405 --> 11:41.405
Right. Good. More like it.

11:44.725 --> 11:46.683
Muslim matchmakers are very...

11:46.685 --> 11:49.163
Yes, I know.

11:49.165 --> 11:50.843
Frank.

11:50.845 --> 11:54.845
Right, er, some sparkling wine
and some beer...

11:56.725 --> 11:58.323
..please?

11:58.325 --> 12:01.163
No "welcome back", "good to see
you", "how have you been?"

12:01.165 --> 12:02.923
Why? Did you go somewhere?

12:02.925 --> 12:06.643
You really are a pig ignorant piece
of shit, aren't you, Gallagher?

12:06.645 --> 12:07.923
Need a hand?

12:07.925 --> 12:10.843
No, fine, thanks.
She is doing my fucking head in.

12:10.845 --> 12:13.963
I said to Ches I'd cover
while Mary Mae shits out that baby,

12:13.965 --> 12:16.483
but I didn't know I'd have to deal
with that psycho.

12:16.485 --> 12:17.763
So, about this drink...?

12:17.765 --> 12:20.803
I can't, Frank.
I know what you're like.

12:20.805 --> 12:23.843
You'll have a few drinks,
few too many,

12:23.845 --> 12:27.845
end up sticking it in Monica again,
nine months later, little baby.

12:28.165 --> 12:31.963
Seven billion folk on this planet.
Somebody's got to take a stand.

12:31.965 --> 12:35.965
It's not for me. It's for Mon.
She's got the baby blues. Please.

12:38.565 --> 12:41.363
All right. I'll serve you.

12:41.365 --> 12:43.763
If you can name all your kids.

12:43.765 --> 12:47.765
Without hesitating.

12:51.285 --> 12:52.603
So, there's, uh...

12:52.605 --> 12:54.683
Hesitation! Fuck off, Frank.

12:54.685 --> 12:57.603
Come on, the nearest offie
is fucking miles away!

12:57.605 --> 13:01.605
Gi'ya chance to think
about what you've done.

13:02.605 --> 13:06.605
Hiya, mate.

13:12.885 --> 13:16.643
Sorry, my dad's not in,
he's out looking for work

13:16.645 --> 13:19.123
and my mum's helping
the mental handicapped.

13:19.125 --> 13:21.403
Relax. It's all right.
I'm not the social.

13:21.405 --> 13:25.269
I'm Fiona.
I got the call to come home.

13:31.732 --> 13:33.552
What about this one?

13:33.604 --> 13:36.224
Second second reminder.

13:36.233 --> 13:37.191
So..?

13:37.193 --> 13:37.991
Bin.

13:37.993 --> 13:39.231
Right. Remember.

13:39.233 --> 13:43.233
Red means dead.

13:46.233 --> 13:47.191
But brown...?

13:47.193 --> 13:51.193
Goes down!

13:56.793 --> 14:00.111
Look good.

14:00.113 --> 14:02.253
How's, uh... whats is name?

14:02.327 --> 14:03.445
Steve.

14:03.447 --> 14:05.965
No...

14:05.967 --> 14:08.685
Is it? Steve?
That doesn't sound right?

14:08.687 --> 14:12.687
Fine. Your grandson's fine, too.
Thanks for asking.

14:12.967 --> 14:16.967
She's my sister.

14:17.767 --> 14:20.485
So... you just happened to
be in the neighbourhood...?

14:20.487 --> 14:23.445
Mum called. About the...

14:23.447 --> 14:24.565
..d-e-a-d b-a-b-y.

14:24.567 --> 14:27.245
Dead baby.

14:27.247 --> 14:30.085
Oh. Right. Yeah. About that...

14:30.087 --> 14:32.685
Fiona! Ahhh!

14:32.687 --> 14:33.845
How are you?

14:33.847 --> 14:36.645
Much better for seeing you, love.

14:36.647 --> 14:38.005
Mum, you're dressed!

14:38.007 --> 14:39.525
Is it too much?

14:39.527 --> 14:43.527
It's all right to show a little
bit of tit at a funeral, isn't it?

14:51.807 --> 14:55.605
What d'you think?

14:55.607 --> 14:58.845
Hello? Opinions, opinions?

14:58.847 --> 15:00.725
Normally, you're full of them...

15:00.727 --> 15:04.727
I'm just... I'm just sorry, Mum.

15:05.087 --> 15:07.805
What you've had to go through.
Losing the baby.

15:07.807 --> 15:09.685
I made a little coffin.

15:09.687 --> 15:12.285
They showed you how to do
it on Blue Peter.

15:12.287 --> 15:14.725
I think it was
really for household pets...

15:14.727 --> 15:16.565
So, uh...

15:16.567 --> 15:19.725
Do you want me to go pick up the...

15:19.727 --> 15:22.485
The body. I mean, is at the
undertaker's or the hospital or..?

15:22.487 --> 15:25.885
I think they probably just flushed
it down the toilet.

15:25.887 --> 15:27.925
They wouldn't do that!

15:27.927 --> 15:30.685
Oh, well, they don't understand,
do they, Fiona?

15:30.687 --> 15:32.485
They're just like your father.

15:32.487 --> 15:35.365
It's a foetus, it doesn't have
a personality.

15:35.367 --> 15:37.605
But what's an acorn?

15:37.607 --> 15:40.325
It's just an oak tree
waiting to happen.

15:40.327 --> 15:42.845
So, when you said the baby
was stillborn...

15:42.847 --> 15:45.125
Well, I don't know the exact
technical term...

15:45.127 --> 15:49.127
I mean, termination sounds a bit
harsh, doesn't it?

15:49.887 --> 15:52.205
I have dropped everything,
I have rushed over here...

15:52.207 --> 15:56.207
You haven't changed, have you?
Always ready to judge me.

15:57.567 --> 16:00.685
I've not changed?!
This is you all over - milkin' it!

16:00.687 --> 16:02.565
Playing the victim,
centre of attention.

16:02.567 --> 16:06.125
Meanwhile, there's a real baby
downstairs, a bunch of bills,

16:06.127 --> 16:07.805
and a whole world you've ignored

16:07.807 --> 16:11.805
because it doesn't revolve around
you!

16:11.807 --> 16:13.445
Tears are not going to work.

16:13.447 --> 16:17.447
You're right, Fiona.
I'm a terrible, terrible person.

16:17.767 --> 16:21.767
You're right.

16:41.287 --> 16:45.287
I told you. Out of jail for a week.
They'll be dragging him in again.

16:45.727 --> 16:49.727
Always happens like that.
They get institutionalised, see?

16:50.607 --> 16:51.645
You speak to Mum?

16:51.647 --> 16:53.245
Nah, just a text.

16:53.247 --> 16:54.325
Did she say who...?

16:54.327 --> 16:58.327
No. Just one of me brother's were...

17:01.527 --> 17:02.885
I'm glad it weren't you.

17:02.887 --> 17:06.887
I'm glad it weren't you!

17:10.487 --> 17:12.204
I wasn't stealing from her.

17:12.207 --> 17:15.724
Here, don't you lot need a warrant?
You can't just barge on in here...

17:15.727 --> 17:17.964
- Is it Ian?
- Is who Ian? What you lot doing here?

17:17.967 --> 17:19.204
Just tell us who's dead, Dad!

17:19.207 --> 17:22.885
Please not little Liam?

17:22.887 --> 17:26.444
Did your mother call you?
Oh, fuck's sake...!

17:26.446 --> 17:30.447
You know who she's got up
there with her? Fiona.

17:31.367 --> 17:33.085
Nobody's dead!

17:33.087 --> 17:37.087
Your mother got up the duff...
twins. She had an abortion.

17:37.207 --> 17:40.925
Fifty percent success rate.
Thanks to Cherokee Linda.

17:40.927 --> 17:42.605
Fifty percent...

17:42.607 --> 17:44.605
I know why
they call your lot the plod!

17:44.607 --> 17:47.765
He's saying we've got
a new family member, mate.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.165
Right, so...
Why did she call us here, then?

17:50.167 --> 17:53.365
Probably to say goodbye to
whatever slid down her leg.

17:53.367 --> 17:54.645
Oh, that's a classic...!

17:54.647 --> 17:55.685
That's crazy.

17:55.687 --> 17:58.565
Yeah, and it's driving me fucking
crazy so listen, just shut up,

17:58.567 --> 18:00.045
be nice, and do what she wants.

18:00.047 --> 18:01.925
So is it a new brother
or sister, we've got?

18:01.927 --> 18:05.645
Does it matter? It's a baby.
It cries, it shits, it eats money.

18:05.647 --> 18:09.647
Fuck's sake... This is ridiculous.
I was told it was an emergency.

18:11.847 --> 18:14.285
It is an emergency! Or is a soul
in limbo to be sniggered at!

18:14.287 --> 18:15.085
I didn't me...

18:15.087 --> 18:17.365
Carl. Show some respect.

18:17.367 --> 18:21.367
Mother.

18:21.607 --> 18:25.607
Sweet sister.

18:25.647 --> 18:29.647
The Brothers Grimm.

18:35.167 --> 18:36.445
I'll see to that, shall I?

18:36.447 --> 18:40.447
Oh, as you're nearest. Thanks, love.

18:41.767 --> 18:45.767
I don't know how to stop him
crying. I'm sorry.

18:52.807 --> 18:54.365
This it, then? No Ian?

18:54.367 --> 18:56.965
No Liam? No Deborah?

18:56.967 --> 18:58.645
She's in Afghanistan, in't she?

18:58.647 --> 19:00.885
Still, you might have thought
that flying home

19:00.887 --> 19:04.887
for her own brother's funeral might
have been slightly more important.

19:05.167 --> 19:08.605
Still, typical Debbie.
Just goes to show.

19:08.607 --> 19:12.607
Have you not changed yet?

19:15.527 --> 19:19.525
Oh. You got this one.

19:19.527 --> 19:23.527
Better than nothing, I suppose.

19:24.287 --> 19:28.287
Shh, shh...
You've got nothing to be sorry about.

19:37.647 --> 19:41.647
There's a place that I read about,
called the Rainbow Road.

19:42.967 --> 19:45.965
And when you lose someone...
a family member...

19:45.967 --> 19:48.045
or someone you love, even a pet...

19:48.047 --> 19:49.805
they're not really gone...

19:49.807 --> 19:53.807
they're just waiting for you.

19:55.647 --> 19:59.045
I'll see you again,
Little William Gallagher.

19:59.047 --> 20:00.285
We all will.

20:00.287 --> 20:03.765
On the Rainbow Road.

20:03.767 --> 20:07.767
When it's our time.

20:09.927 --> 20:13.927
# Somewhere

20:14.447 --> 20:18.285
# Over the rainbow... #

20:18.287 --> 20:20.845
What's up with you?!

20:20.847 --> 20:24.847
I'm giving this event the exact
level of respect it deserves.

20:25.087 --> 20:26.565
She's our mum.

20:26.567 --> 20:27.885
You don't change, do you?

20:27.887 --> 20:31.045
World's just there for you
to take the piss out of.

20:31.047 --> 20:32.765
D'you know what's in that box?

20:32.767 --> 20:33.925
I'll give you a clue.

20:33.927 --> 20:37.445
It starts with
"fuck" and ends with "all".

20:37.447 --> 20:38.485
# Somewhere...

20:38.487 --> 20:40.005
It means something to her.

20:40.007 --> 20:42.645
Mum loves having kids. Nah.

20:42.647 --> 20:44.325
Mum loves being pregnant.

20:44.327 --> 20:46.965
She likes being
the centre of attention.

20:46.967 --> 20:49.685
She hates having kids.

20:49.687 --> 20:53.485
That's the glitch in the masterplan.

20:53.487 --> 20:55.285
Still think you're better than
the rest of us, yeah?

20:55.287 --> 20:56.765
Carl!

20:56.767 --> 21:00.767
I'm sure whatever you want to
discuss with Phillip is very important...

21:01.567 --> 21:04.485
but we're trying to bury your dead
brother.

21:04.487 --> 21:08.487
So can it just wait a minute?

21:09.407 --> 21:12.365
# If happy little bluebirds fly

21:12.367 --> 21:14.925
# Above the rainbow

21:14.927 --> 21:18.927
# Why, oh, why... can't... #

21:22.087 --> 21:26.087
How much did he weigh,
when he were born?

21:26.527 --> 21:29.605
I don't like to put an exact
figure on it, y'know...

21:29.607 --> 21:32.045
They can get sensitive.
Bulimic, and that.

21:32.047 --> 21:34.565
Right, course.

21:34.567 --> 21:38.567
He had all his shots?

21:39.567 --> 21:43.205
Diphtheria, tetanus, polio...
Bubonic plague...?

21:43.207 --> 21:46.725
Is there a point to this?
He's fine!

21:46.727 --> 21:49.125
He's happy as a... baby.

21:49.127 --> 21:51.365
Nothing about this is fine.

21:51.367 --> 21:52.645
Oh, here it comes.

21:52.647 --> 21:54.925
Why can you lot never come back
with a smile?

21:54.927 --> 21:57.485
Always have to slip
a dagger in there, don't you?

21:57.487 --> 22:01.487
I'm just saying. Don't do to Stella
what you did to me.

22:03.487 --> 22:07.045
Yeah, give her a nice life,
happy home, family around her?

22:07.047 --> 22:10.565
I didn't get much of a childhood.
You made me the mother.

22:10.567 --> 22:14.567
You fucked off and abandoned us,
riding your high horse out of town.

22:15.007 --> 22:19.007
Some fucking mother you turned out
to be, eh?!

22:19.487 --> 22:23.487
Told you not to come back.

22:24.287 --> 22:28.287
Lip. Wait up.

22:28.807 --> 22:32.807
Take Frank down the pub. Monica.
Get them nice and drunk.

22:33.807 --> 22:35.485
Funeral party.

22:35.487 --> 22:39.405
You're not seriously falling for
his bullshit, are you?

22:39.407 --> 22:40.925
I'm taking the kids.

22:40.927 --> 22:44.005
Just tell me, from the heart,
you think it's the wrong thing to do.

22:44.007 --> 22:45.965
That they'd be better off here
with them.

22:45.967 --> 22:49.967
Just say it, and I'll keep it shut,
and do nothing.

22:54.167 --> 22:58.167
Drinks are on me! Don't worry.
Fiona's going to baby-sit the kids.

23:00.767 --> 23:02.965
Stella!

23:02.967 --> 23:06.967
Never hear the end of that one!

23:07.047 --> 23:10.725
Thanks, Fiona.
Total star, as always.

23:10.727 --> 23:12.001
Yeah.

23:27.943 --> 23:30.141
What?
Not bother answering your phone?

23:30.143 --> 23:34.143
Er, no, not when it's my day off
and I'm trying to have a lie-in.

23:37.502 --> 23:40.260
Look, I just need to go home
for an hour or so,

23:40.262 --> 23:43.100
I need to speak to Steve about something,
my head's all over the place.

23:43.102 --> 23:46.945
- "Hi, Kev, how are you, Kev?
Sorry for waking you, Kev."
- I just need your help.

23:47.247 --> 23:48.845
No! No, I can't.

23:48.847 --> 23:50.607
I'm rubbish with kids.

23:50.611 --> 23:53.231
This is Frank's daughter. Stella.

23:53.242 --> 23:54.480
And this is his new baby.

23:54.482 --> 23:55.960
This is Uncle Kev.

23:55.962 --> 23:59.962
Just Kev. Kev's fine.
Why can't Frank look after them?

24:03.202 --> 24:04.920
Fiona, what have you gone and done?

24:04.922 --> 24:07.480
I can't turn up at home with two
new kids. I need to warn Steve.

24:07.482 --> 24:09.480
Once I explain to him
what it's like for them

24:09.482 --> 24:11.280
here with Mum and Dad,
how bad it is,

24:11.282 --> 24:13.480
he'll probably suggest
the idea himself.

24:13.482 --> 24:15.960
Say, "Bring 'em to stay here!"

24:15.962 --> 24:17.680
Ohh!

24:17.682 --> 24:20.560
You do realise
that I am still saying no, right?

24:20.562 --> 24:22.400
Two hours, tops.

24:22.402 --> 24:26.000
You just said one a minute ago.

24:26.002 --> 24:30.002
Oh, Fiona. Fiona!

24:30.202 --> 24:33.000
So, you're Stella.

24:33.002 --> 24:34.720
What's this one called?

24:34.722 --> 24:38.722
Heineken?

24:38.802 --> 24:42.000
I keep on thinking about y'know,
what might have been.

24:42.002 --> 24:44.400
His little face
lighting up on Christmas Day.

24:44.402 --> 24:46.880
"Is that a bike, Mummy?

24:46.882 --> 24:50.882
"Did Santa bring it all the way
from the North Pole?"

24:51.322 --> 24:52.920
I need a slash.

24:52.922 --> 24:56.640
Poor kid. Just like Elvis.
He had a stillborn twin brother.

24:56.642 --> 24:59.560
The King was haunted by it,
all his life.

24:59.562 --> 25:00.840
Oh, don't say that.

25:00.842 --> 25:02.280
Yeah, don't.

25:02.282 --> 25:05.640
Maybe I should have another,
y'know, to keep him company.

25:05.642 --> 25:07.720
Oh, you want to give
your fanny a rest, love.

25:07.722 --> 25:11.722
Overworked as it is.

25:11.922 --> 25:13.440
Eh, come on, Mon.

25:13.442 --> 25:15.040
Turn that frown upside down.

25:15.042 --> 25:17.360
We're finally getting our party.

25:17.362 --> 25:21.362
How can you celebrate
at a time like this?

25:21.522 --> 25:25.160
This whole thing was meant
to cure your post-bloody-natalism.

25:25.162 --> 25:28.000
Cure?

25:28.002 --> 25:29.480
I'm not ill, Frank.

25:29.482 --> 25:33.400
I'm a human being
with feelings and emotions.

25:33.402 --> 25:35.840
I've been through
a very traumatic event.

25:35.842 --> 25:38.800
How many kids
have you had before, Mon, eh?

25:38.802 --> 25:40.640
Jesus, how many abortions, Mon?

25:40.642 --> 25:44.000
Double figures.
So c'mon, cheer up.

25:44.002 --> 25:46.480
Have a drink, few pills, a party.

25:46.482 --> 25:49.240
That's the best medicine.

25:49.242 --> 25:52.160
Right?

25:52.162 --> 25:53.680
# Baby love

25:53.682 --> 25:55.920
# My baby love

25:55.922 --> 25:58.800
# Baby, oh, oh... #

25:58.802 --> 26:00.840
What?

26:00.842 --> 26:03.120
Can you not even pretend
to take this seriously?

26:03.122 --> 26:04.520
No.

26:04.522 --> 26:07.680
I'm trying, Fiona is,
even Dad's doing his bit.

26:07.682 --> 26:09.040
Oh, yeah.!

26:09.042 --> 26:11.080
Fiona's taking it
really fucking serious!

26:11.082 --> 26:12.480
Off the scale.

26:12.482 --> 26:13.920
What's that supposed to mean?

26:13.922 --> 26:17.840
Oh, mate. Can't you work out
the pieces, Columbo?

26:17.842 --> 26:20.280
We're here.

26:20.282 --> 26:23.280
Fiona, Stella, the new baby,

26:23.282 --> 26:27.282
they're not.

26:28.362 --> 26:29.720
Nah, she wouldn't.

26:29.722 --> 26:32.640
She already has.

26:32.642 --> 26:34.200
Wait, where you going?

26:34.202 --> 26:36.680
Where do you think?

26:36.682 --> 26:37.840
Carl!

26:37.842 --> 26:41.842
Don't say owt!

26:42.282 --> 26:44.920
Enough!

26:44.922 --> 26:46.240
Aaaaaargh!

26:46.242 --> 26:48.400
Enough!

26:48.402 --> 26:50.400
Stop it!

26:50.402 --> 26:52.920
Stop that now!

26:52.922 --> 26:55.600
How dare you disgrace
your brother's memory!

26:55.602 --> 26:57.960
They've nicked them!
They've nicked them!

26:57.962 --> 26:59.320
What are you talking about?

26:59.322 --> 27:00.000
Shut up!

27:00.002 --> 27:03.160
Fiona. She's taken the kids!

27:03.162 --> 27:04.480
I know.

27:04.482 --> 27:06.960
No. Away. For good.

27:06.962 --> 27:10.962
Will you shut up?
Just shut it, will you!

27:17.402 --> 27:18.640
Frank!

27:18.642 --> 27:20.480
What?

27:20.482 --> 27:21.840
My babies!

27:21.842 --> 27:25.842
Fiona! She's taken my babies!

27:30.482 --> 27:34.482
Babies eat cornflakes, don't they?

27:35.082 --> 27:37.560
Babies eat cornflakes,
everyone does, don't they?

27:37.562 --> 27:40.720
Right.

27:40.722 --> 27:43.040
Stella?

27:43.042 --> 27:45.520
Oh, right, you're playing
hide 'n' seek, are you?

27:45.522 --> 27:49.522
All right, you've won.

27:54.362 --> 27:55.480
Oh, no!

27:55.482 --> 27:57.840
No, no!

27:57.842 --> 28:00.640
No!

28:00.642 --> 28:01.960
Stella!

28:01.962 --> 28:04.200
So much for happy bloody families.

28:04.202 --> 28:06.360
Where's Fiona taken them?

28:06.362 --> 28:10.120
I'm not telling you
fucking anything.

28:10.122 --> 28:11.200
You're a squealer.

28:11.202 --> 28:12.440
What if it were your kid, Lip?

28:12.442 --> 28:16.442
What if Fiona decided you
weren't fit to look after Katie, eh?

28:16.762 --> 28:19.640
We'll get the police on her,
social, everyone.

28:19.642 --> 28:23.642
I am not letting that uppity bitch
take my children from me. Not now, not ever.

28:23.882 --> 28:25.200
Ssh. Ssh now.

28:25.202 --> 28:26.680
Don't shush me!

28:26.682 --> 28:29.480
No, no. This is what
we always wanted, Mon.

28:29.482 --> 28:31.040
The big dream.

28:31.042 --> 28:33.120
To be free of the kids.

28:33.122 --> 28:34.880
Let 'em go, on the breeze.

28:34.882 --> 28:36.320
You're a monster!

28:36.322 --> 28:40.322
You've buried
an empty fucking box today.

28:42.202 --> 28:44.800
Get away from me, you repulsive...

28:44.802 --> 28:48.802
cunt!

28:49.042 --> 28:50.880
Being honest.

28:50.882 --> 28:54.120
I know you feel the same way.
This is it.

28:54.122 --> 28:58.122
This is our chance.

29:00.042 --> 29:02.360
Just get out, Frank!

29:02.362 --> 29:06.362
I wish you had
never, never come back.

29:06.762 --> 29:08.680
Now, out!

29:08.682 --> 29:12.682
Go on!

29:12.802 --> 29:16.802
Out! Go on.

29:20.082 --> 29:21.800
Take a good look.

29:21.802 --> 29:22.960
Eh?

29:22.962 --> 29:25.640
Take a fucking photo.

29:25.642 --> 29:29.642
Because this, this is the last time

29:29.882 --> 29:33.882
you will ever see
Vernon Francis Gallagher.

29:45.802 --> 29:49.802
Forgot me fags.

29:57.242 --> 30:00.418
- Lost. I've lost 'em.
- What do you mean you've lost 'em?

30:00.722 --> 30:02.640
Well, one minute they were there,

30:02.642 --> 30:06.642
and then they weren't.

30:07.082 --> 30:08.360
Frank...

30:08.362 --> 30:09.560
I...

30:09.562 --> 30:12.680
I've lost your kids.

30:12.682 --> 30:16.682
I'm so sorry, mate.

30:20.322 --> 30:22.920
See if you can make the rest of
'em disappear, there'll be

30:22.922 --> 30:25.320
a little something extra
in your pay packet this week.

30:25.322 --> 30:29.120
Frank! This is serious.

30:29.122 --> 30:32.680
Kev Ball. Smarter than he looks.

30:32.682 --> 30:34.840
Admittedly no great achievement.

30:34.842 --> 30:38.800
But, he's got no kids,
nothing tying him down.

30:38.802 --> 30:41.560
Oh, he's got it all sorted,
has our Kev.

30:41.562 --> 30:43.720
But me, 16 years old,

30:43.722 --> 30:47.722
walked out of school
for the last time, world at my feet.

30:48.482 --> 30:50.720
And what did I do?
I had kids. Tons of them.

30:50.722 --> 30:53.600
Boat loads of the
mewling, whining twats.

30:53.602 --> 30:54.640
Oi!

30:54.642 --> 30:57.200
Frank Gallagher. Fucking genius.

30:57.202 --> 31:00.200
Keep fucking and breeding,
fucking and breeding.

31:00.202 --> 31:02.400
Each kid, 16 to 18 years.

31:02.402 --> 31:04.280
At least,

31:04.282 --> 31:06.080
that's prison.

31:06.082 --> 31:09.720
Socrates. Alexander the Great.
Julius Caesar. Lenny Da Vinci.

31:09.722 --> 31:11.120
All great men.

31:11.122 --> 31:13.880
None of 'em were stupid
enough to have any kids.

31:13.882 --> 31:16.520
But we can't all do great things.

31:16.522 --> 31:20.120
Life is long. Have to fill it
somehow. Distract yourself.

31:20.122 --> 31:21.600
Films. Telly.

31:21.602 --> 31:23.400
Music. Pub.

31:23.402 --> 31:25.400
Fiddling on fucking mobile phones

31:25.402 --> 31:29.040
like the meaning of life
might pop up any second.

31:29.042 --> 31:31.520
Worshipping overpaid ponces

31:31.522 --> 31:34.960
who's only loyalty
is to the almighty pound.

31:34.962 --> 31:38.840
Waiting for that moment,

31:38.842 --> 31:42.842
that wonder that will put everything

31:43.082 --> 31:46.040
into some kind of order,
that will say

31:46.042 --> 31:48.920
"Your life was not in vain."

31:48.922 --> 31:52.160
Mind you, I'd still let Franny Lee
shit in my mouth for nothing.

31:52.162 --> 31:55.762
But he was a different class
though, like Buzzer and Bell!

31:58.322 --> 32:02.000
Yeahhhhhh!

32:02.002 --> 32:05.320
We're not nearly here.

32:05.322 --> 32:09.322
But to fill your empty
little life with family,

32:09.482 --> 32:13.482
ungrateful, selfish family,
that's the biggest joke of all.

32:14.322 --> 32:18.322
Regret whatever you did or
you didn't, the lives you ruined,

32:18.802 --> 32:21.280
the ones you saved,
it makes no difference.

32:21.282 --> 32:22.480
It all ends in dust.

32:22.482 --> 32:25.800
And I'm tired
of pretending not to care

32:25.802 --> 32:27.720
or caring not to pretend

32:27.722 --> 32:31.722
and I can't remember
what it was like before them.

32:33.922 --> 32:36.560
Before the fucking kids, the bills,

32:36.562 --> 32:39.800
the towering horror of family life

32:39.802 --> 32:43.720
casting its shadow over every single
fucking breath I take,

32:43.722 --> 32:45.320
another mouth to feed,

32:45.322 --> 32:49.322
another wailing anguished mouth
to tell me what I already know.

32:51.842 --> 32:55.842
I am not good enough.

32:55.962 --> 32:58.360
And them,

32:58.362 --> 33:02.362
they're always the ones to leave.

33:03.202 --> 33:07.202
I've had it the wrong way round.
Should have been me.

33:14.402 --> 33:18.402
Magic mystery bus to wherever.

33:19.842 --> 33:23.842
One-way ticket,
thank you, no return.

33:28.602 --> 33:32.602
I'm the one who needs to walk away.

33:36.842 --> 33:38.240
Dad?

33:38.242 --> 33:40.360
Oh, what are you doing here?

33:40.362 --> 33:41.600
I followed you.

33:41.602 --> 33:45.000
Well, don't.
You're better off with Fiona.

33:45.002 --> 33:46.480
I mean,

33:46.482 --> 33:49.600
I don't paint eggs
and go to the swing park,

33:49.602 --> 33:51.760
or have teddy bear's
fucking tea parties.

33:51.762 --> 33:53.640
You're better off with her.

33:53.642 --> 33:56.440
You getting on mate or what?

33:56.442 --> 33:59.800
Get off! You were a mistake.
Don't you get it?

33:59.802 --> 34:02.540
You ruined my life,
the day you were born.

34:02.542 --> 34:03.542
Oh, what's that?

34:03.623 --> 34:05.183
Another one, another trap?

34:05.237 --> 34:06.977
You ruined my life!

34:27.059 --> 34:31.239
Right. Look everywhere for them.
Yeah? Every street, every alley.

34:31.252 --> 34:34.112
They've got to be here somewhere.

34:34.187 --> 34:36.065
How do you lose two fucking kids?

34:36.067 --> 34:37.385
It's my day off.

34:37.387 --> 34:39.985
Somebody's
gonna need to keep Monica busy.

34:39.987 --> 34:42.745
Stella, come on now,
where are you?

34:42.746 --> 34:45.745
Me?

34:45.746 --> 34:49.065
If she finds out
they're missing... Boom!

34:49.067 --> 34:50.985
How am I gonna do that?

34:50.987 --> 34:54.987
You're a smart lad, Kev.
You'll work summat out.

34:59.347 --> 35:03.347
Lillian, I need your help.

35:03.867 --> 35:07.867
Stella!

35:08.387 --> 35:09.905
Stella.

35:09.907 --> 35:11.145
Stella, love.

35:11.147 --> 35:14.585
Feel for you. You've not
been around much, have you?

35:14.587 --> 35:18.587
Patreesha's practically taken
over being Ches' mum.

35:19.187 --> 35:23.187
Expect she'll be, er, pushing you out
the picture when the baby pops out.

35:23.787 --> 35:27.105
Nah. We're family.

35:27.107 --> 35:30.505
Where's Ches and Mary Mae now?

35:30.507 --> 35:32.105
Round at Patreesha's.

35:32.107 --> 35:36.107
Oh, right.

35:37.947 --> 35:41.505
Stella!

35:41.507 --> 35:43.265
Stella!

35:43.267 --> 35:47.267
Stella! Come on home!

35:48.787 --> 35:49.985
What we gonna do?

35:49.987 --> 35:53.785
I don't know.
Fiona always sorted this shit out.

35:53.787 --> 35:56.505
Well, she's landed us
all in it this time, hasn't she?

35:56.507 --> 35:58.265
You know, Mum's gonna go mental.

35:58.267 --> 36:00.025
Stella!

36:00.027 --> 36:01.465
You know what? Call the police.

36:01.467 --> 36:03.465
Have Fiona dragged off
in fucking chains.

36:03.467 --> 36:07.105
Fuck that! What if we
just don't find them.

36:07.107 --> 36:11.107
I mean Stella and the baby.
What if they're just... Gone.

36:13.827 --> 36:17.827
Stella!

36:21.227 --> 36:25.227
Didn't have me bus fare.
Quid should do it.

36:30.187 --> 36:33.065
Never understood
the appeal of these places.

36:33.067 --> 36:35.985
I mean, look at that kid.

36:35.987 --> 36:39.987
Definition of "easily amused"
that one.

36:45.667 --> 36:48.825
Look, kiddo, we don't have
to part on bad terms.

36:48.827 --> 36:50.945
You told me to go away.

36:50.947 --> 36:54.105
Well, yeah, I did, but...

36:54.107 --> 36:56.065
You said I was a mistake.

36:56.067 --> 37:00.067
Yeah, and it was. But, you know,
all me kids were mistakes.

37:06.347 --> 37:10.347
Look. My father, he was...

37:10.867 --> 37:12.265
You all right, love?

37:12.267 --> 37:13.345
You all right, love?

37:13.347 --> 37:15.105
Is this man bothering you?

37:15.107 --> 37:17.945
Oh, great! The curtain twitchers.

37:17.947 --> 37:19.345
I'm her dad, love.

37:19.347 --> 37:21.865
He's not my dad.

37:21.867 --> 37:23.385
She's just in a mood.

37:23.387 --> 37:24.145
Do you know him?

37:24.147 --> 37:25.345
He's not my dad.

37:25.347 --> 37:27.145
Look, I think
maybe you should leave.

37:27.147 --> 37:28.825
Well, that's the plan.

37:28.827 --> 37:31.785
So I suggest you should
mind your own fucking beeswax.

37:31.787 --> 37:34.145
Right. That's it.
I'm phoning the police.

37:34.147 --> 37:36.505
Look, I'm her fucking father!

37:36.507 --> 37:37.825
He's not my dad.

37:37.827 --> 37:40.785
It is a disgrace. Nowhere
is safe from them these days.

37:40.787 --> 37:42.585
I'm telling you, you weirdo.

37:42.587 --> 37:45.265
I am not one of them.
I'm one of you.

37:45.267 --> 37:47.505
I'm just a simple person,

37:47.507 --> 37:50.025
struggling with
the hopes and fears of parenthood.

37:50.027 --> 37:51.985
My dad is nice and kind.

37:51.987 --> 37:53.385
I'm kind!

37:53.387 --> 37:57.387
And he never tells me to go away
and he never shouts at me

37:57.947 --> 38:01.947
and he takes me places
and he loves me.

38:02.427 --> 38:06.427
I love you!

38:13.027 --> 38:17.027
I want to go
and play on the swings now.

38:29.467 --> 38:30.825
See, told you.

38:30.827 --> 38:32.665
So why don't you
take your pitchforks

38:32.667 --> 38:34.625
and go and torment
some other poor bastard.

38:34.627 --> 38:36.225
You've gotta be careful, you know.

38:36.227 --> 38:38.185
I'm sorry
but you do look like a right weirdo.

38:38.187 --> 38:40.587
Come on.

38:48.787 --> 38:52.787
Oh, for fuck's sake.

38:55.867 --> 38:59.025
Hiya, Monica, where you off to?

38:59.027 --> 39:00.585
Home.

39:00.587 --> 39:03.425
I've got you this. It needs a walk.

39:03.427 --> 39:04.705
It's missing a leg.

39:04.707 --> 39:07.785
It's a stray.
They were going to put it down.

39:07.787 --> 39:08.905
Terminate it.

39:08.907 --> 39:11.705
Awww. It's only got three legs.

39:11.707 --> 39:13.025
Yeah, I know.

39:13.027 --> 39:17.027
Poor little bugger.
Nobody to love you. Nobody to care.

39:19.187 --> 39:21.065
Just like me.

39:21.067 --> 39:24.785
Come here, you.

39:24.787 --> 39:27.625
You take your time. Get acquainted.

39:27.627 --> 39:30.305
Why are you being so nice to me?

39:30.307 --> 39:32.905
I'm just being neighbourly,
you know and all that.

39:32.907 --> 39:35.305
I might be post natal
but I'm not post stupid.

39:35.307 --> 39:39.307
What are you hiding?

39:39.627 --> 39:42.545
Kev? Where's the kids?

39:42.547 --> 39:44.905
Yes, that's the thing, isn't it,
Fiona?

39:44.907 --> 39:48.907
You steal my children, and then you
abandon them with this idiot.

39:48.947 --> 39:50.785
It's my day off!

39:50.787 --> 39:52.305
You lost them?

39:52.307 --> 39:55.025
Well, don't blame him.
You're the one that done this.

39:55.027 --> 39:57.985
Oh, that's right, I was the one
who ignored them, who made Stella

39:57.987 --> 40:01.987
look after a little baby
all by herself. It was all me, Mum.

40:05.187 --> 40:09.025
You get that one. But that's all.

40:09.027 --> 40:11.945
You should have been beaten
every day of your life.

40:11.947 --> 40:13.505
Why did you come back?

40:13.507 --> 40:15.185
To show us where we were going wrong?

40:15.187 --> 40:16.265
You asked me.

40:16.267 --> 40:19.385
Well, I wish I hadn't.
You're tearing this family apart.

40:19.387 --> 40:21.865
I was the one who kept it together!
For years!

40:21.867 --> 40:23.465
I was the fucking glue!

40:23.467 --> 40:25.385
No childhood, no let up.

40:25.387 --> 40:28.065
Where were you? Where the
fuck was you?

40:28.067 --> 40:30.627
All right, Fiona... Ow!

40:32.587 --> 40:36.545
Eh, eh, can you keep the noise down?
The baby's sleeping.

40:36.547 --> 40:39.385
Where were they?

40:39.387 --> 40:42.705
With me. We went to the swing park.

40:42.707 --> 40:44.465
Why? Was there a problem?

40:44.467 --> 40:46.225
No, no. You are not doing this.

40:46.227 --> 40:50.185
You are not whitewashing over this.
She stole our children.

40:50.187 --> 40:51.305
Give me the baby, Frank.

40:51.307 --> 40:52.425
Dad. It's Dad.

40:52.427 --> 40:53.945
Give him to me.

40:53.947 --> 40:55.865
You are not taking our kids.

40:55.867 --> 40:56.905
No, you're not.

40:56.907 --> 40:58.345
You think this changes anything?

40:58.347 --> 41:00.705
How long are you going to
stay for this time, Mum?

41:00.707 --> 41:04.225
How many years is it gonna take
to get a loaf of bread?

41:04.227 --> 41:07.425
Stella!

41:07.427 --> 41:08.665
Where's the baby?

41:08.667 --> 41:11.785
In there with their dad.

41:11.787 --> 41:15.265
Go on then, tell her.
She's not taking our children.

41:15.267 --> 41:17.225
They're on my side.

41:17.227 --> 41:19.425
We're not on anyone's side. Jesus!

41:19.427 --> 41:22.665
You seriously think it's fine to
leave these kids with him and her?

41:22.667 --> 41:24.465
Nah, you're right.

41:24.467 --> 41:25.905
I mean, you were stuck with us.

41:25.907 --> 41:28.465
And look what a fuck-up
you turned out.

41:28.467 --> 41:29.985
Piss off.

41:29.987 --> 41:33.987
Exactly. You turned out OK.
So did I. And Ian...

41:34.107 --> 41:37.665
Well, Ian's marrying a tranny but,
you know, it's wonderful,

41:37.667 --> 41:39.385
best of both worlds.

41:39.387 --> 41:41.865
And Debbie, off tackling insurgents,

41:41.867 --> 41:45.867
and Liam, getting his act together,
Buddhism - it's crazy!

41:46.547 --> 41:47.825
What about me?

41:47.827 --> 41:51.705
Could be worse. Could be a Tory.

41:51.707 --> 41:55.707
It doesn't change anything.
They don't care about us.

41:56.467 --> 42:00.467
They never will.

42:01.027 --> 42:05.027
Dad didn't get the bus.
He was going away but he didn't.

42:07.547 --> 42:11.547
Why not?

42:11.747 --> 42:15.747
There were financial issues vis-a-vis
the purchase of a ticket.

42:17.747 --> 42:21.747
I'll lend it you.
Nah, I'll give it you.

42:23.307 --> 42:27.307
Anything you like.

42:28.307 --> 42:30.745
You don't want to.

42:30.747 --> 42:34.747
You can't, can you?

42:35.627 --> 42:39.627
Not while there's still some of us
around.

42:44.147 --> 42:46.985
Right. Get your coats.

42:46.987 --> 42:48.785
Get your coats!

42:48.787 --> 42:51.705
Come on, you lot always think
the worst about me, don't you?

42:51.707 --> 42:53.905
Come on. Come on!

42:53.907 --> 42:57.907
Drinks. For the family.

43:05.347 --> 43:07.265
It's OK, it's OK, I'll do it.

43:07.267 --> 43:09.745
Erm, I'm not useless.

43:09.747 --> 43:12.465
I know your game.
Trying to sideline me.

43:12.467 --> 43:13.865
Fucking wise to you.

43:13.867 --> 43:15.185
Watch your mouth, you.

43:15.187 --> 43:16.985
Don't talk to her like that.

43:16.987 --> 43:19.185
I can fight my own battles,
you mad bitch.

43:19.187 --> 43:21.025
Who are you calling a mad bitch?

43:21.027 --> 43:22.625
I'm calling you a mad bitch!

43:22.627 --> 43:24.547
Fuck's sake!

43:27.307 --> 43:30.185
It's not a party
without a proper fight.

43:30.187 --> 43:34.187
I am so turned on right now.

43:35.587 --> 43:39.587
You did a good job.

43:39.707 --> 43:41.705
S'pose.

43:41.707 --> 43:44.907
I s'pose there are a couple of
things I could learn from you.

43:47.787 --> 43:50.905
Mum!

43:50.907 --> 43:54.105
I can't, I'm post natal.

43:54.107 --> 43:55.585
C'mon.

43:55.587 --> 43:57.385
You're not bloody post natal.

43:57.387 --> 44:00.105
You just want to be
the centre of attention.

44:00.107 --> 44:03.065
There's lots of things you don't
know about me, Fiona Gallagher.

44:03.067 --> 44:04.065
Come on.

44:04.067 --> 44:06.065
Ooh!

44:06.067 --> 44:10.067
Fi, go and get her a drink.

44:17.747 --> 44:21.747
Come on, Fi, come and dance.
Come on.

44:22.147 --> 44:23.625
Come on, we're dancing.

44:23.627 --> 44:27.627
Come and have a dance.

44:28.507 --> 44:30.865
Somebody's nicked all our pills
from behind the bar.

44:30.867 --> 44:32.585
Wonder who that could be?

44:32.587 --> 44:36.587
I tell you what, do us a favour
and we'll say no more about it.

44:39.547 --> 44:42.065
Some twat's still not
shifted his car from outside.

44:42.067 --> 44:46.065
You know what to do.

44:46.067 --> 44:50.067
My kids say they hate me,
but secretly they love me.

44:52.067 --> 44:56.067
And I love them but secretly
hate them, well, not so secretly,

44:57.387 --> 44:59.305
but it doesn't matter.

44:59.307 --> 45:03.307
They'll whinge and whine and moan
and groan about the shadow I cast.

45:05.427 --> 45:09.427
That I defined their lives.
But it's all upside down.

45:12.387 --> 45:15.027
It was them that defined me.

45:20.707 --> 45:24.707
Without them I'm just that guy
at the end of the bar.

45:25.547 --> 45:29.547
That guy quite possibly soiling
himself on the public transport.

45:29.827 --> 45:33.425
The fella sitting slumped on
a park bench, Sunday afternoon,

45:33.427 --> 45:35.467
as the world dissipates around him.

45:42.187 --> 45:45.425
Or, you know, maybe I would
have been an investment banker

45:45.427 --> 45:49.025
with a surgically enhanced wife
and a penis extension for a car,

45:49.027 --> 45:53.027
but either way, I'm not part
of them. They're parts of me.

45:58.027 --> 45:59.547
All of 'em.

46:30.027 --> 46:34.027
These annoying, ungrateful,
amazing bastards I call my kids,

46:37.187 --> 46:41.187
think for themselves,
speak their mind, go their own way,

46:41.347 --> 46:43.505
show me how it should be done.

46:43.507 --> 46:47.507
And, most importantly,
first and foremost to a man,

46:47.747 --> 46:51.747
they'll always know what the most
vital necessity in this life is...

46:54.987 --> 46:57.505
..right?

46:57.507 --> 46:58.625
Right?

46:58.627 --> 47:00.978
Scatter!
