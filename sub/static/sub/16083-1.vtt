01:26.880 --> 01:27.869
Mommy!

02:41.120 --> 02:43.236
What brings you to the center?

02:43.880 --> 02:47.953
Complete tear of the anterior
cruciate ligaments in my right leg.

02:48.600 --> 02:49.669
That must hurt.

02:50.320 --> 02:51.514
Yes, it hurts.

02:52.240 --> 02:55.915
Can you talk me through your accident?

02:58.400 --> 03:00.630
l was going downhill, too fast I guess.

03:00.800 --> 03:03.439
My skis got tangled and...

03:06.400 --> 03:07.594
I went flying.

03:08.320 --> 03:11.118
Why did you fall that particular day?

03:11.920 --> 03:12.909
I don't know.

03:13.080 --> 03:15.355
Most likely,
I was going too fast and l...

03:15.840 --> 03:17.956
My skis got tangled...

03:19.280 --> 03:21.510
Why did your skis get tangled?

03:28.000 --> 03:29.956
Sometimes we lose sight of things.

03:30.120 --> 03:33.510
We don't know where we're going,
we're running, we're rushing,

03:33.680 --> 03:35.750
we're looking ahead, never behind.

03:36.040 --> 03:37.109
We trip and fall.

03:39.160 --> 03:40.115
Right?

03:42.840 --> 03:45.229
Sometimes
we can't get back on our feet.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.278
Say "my knee," will you?

03:52.440 --> 03:53.270
Slowly.

03:53.920 --> 03:54.670
Please.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.154
"My knee."

03:56.680 --> 03:57.590
"Me-ll

03:58.000 --> 03:58.876
"We."

04:01.320 --> 04:03.993
What if I'd said shoulder?

04:04.160 --> 04:06.071
- What then?
- It doesn't work every time.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.675
But I'll read you something

04:08.880 --> 04:10.871
and you tell me what you think.

04:12.040 --> 04:14.918
"The knee
signifies the capacity to let go,

04:15.320 --> 04:16.355
"give way

04:16.560 --> 04:17.515
"or even retreat,

04:17.680 --> 04:21.149
"since it is a joint
that allows only backward flexion.

04:22.440 --> 04:24.158
"Pain in the knee

04:24.560 --> 04:26.516
"suggests that one has difficulty

04:26.680 --> 04:29.035
"accepting an event in one's life,

04:29.320 --> 04:33.632
"and healing proceeds
along the same psychological path."

04:35.680 --> 04:37.716
It may be pop psychology,

04:38.040 --> 04:40.190
but think it over

04:41.080 --> 04:43.435
and come back to talk again.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.116
Sure.

04:49.520 --> 04:50.839
What happened?

07:29.520 --> 07:30.635
Recognize me?

07:31.600 --> 07:32.350
No.

07:34.920 --> 07:37.957
- Can't you go eat together?
- No, not without you.

07:38.320 --> 07:39.992
We need you to defend us.

07:40.240 --> 07:43.835
You look like death warmed over.
Who'd hassle you at this time?

07:44.640 --> 07:45.516
Dream on!

07:45.880 --> 07:48.394
Who'd hit on two zombies

07:48.880 --> 07:50.552
coming out of a club?

07:50.720 --> 07:51.755
I'm going to bed.

07:52.040 --> 07:53.792
I did recognize you earlier.

07:53.960 --> 07:55.075
Just not right away.

07:55.240 --> 07:56.229
Tony, we're gone.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.231
Now it's all coming back.

07:58.720 --> 07:59.550
Tony.

07:59.720 --> 08:00.914
Your name's Tony.

08:01.720 --> 08:02.675
Right?

08:03.680 --> 08:06.513
- I knew it was a man's name.
- Where'd we meet?

08:06.680 --> 08:08.636
Faces before names.
You remember me?

08:08.800 --> 08:10.552
You remembered my face.

08:10.720 --> 08:14.156
Earlier, you rock up
and flick water in my face.

08:14.320 --> 08:16.675
- You don't remember my face.
- I do.

08:16.840 --> 08:18.239
Love you, Tony.

08:18.720 --> 08:19.835
How about breakfast?

08:21.440 --> 08:24.557
Let's go have breakfast.
Look me in the eye and say no.

08:27.760 --> 08:29.955
- See?
- Wait a second, I can do it.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.155
- Wait for what?
- I'll do it.

08:31.320 --> 08:31.957
Go on.

08:32.919 --> 08:34.318
2, 3, you lose!

08:34.520 --> 08:36.238
Come on, breakfast!

08:37.840 --> 08:39.511
No, come on, please!

08:44.600 --> 08:45.635
Jeez!

08:47.840 --> 08:49.034
Check out the mural.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.155
Mind-boggling.

08:52.280 --> 08:54.350
So, we have a foosball table.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.275
Overgrown teen.

09:01.400 --> 09:02.230
Out of tune.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.558
Nice place you have here.

09:05.320 --> 09:07.276
Check out the rest if you want.

09:08.320 --> 09:09.548
I won't be long.

09:18.000 --> 09:18.796
What?

09:19.760 --> 09:20.829
Can I just say...

09:21.160 --> 09:23.390
Rich or poor, your feet still stink.

09:24.960 --> 09:27.030
A hint of truffle in hot chocolate.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.158
You don't shave it, just grate it.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.231
It's not cheese, it's a truffle.

09:32.560 --> 09:34.710
The simplest things are the best.

09:36.560 --> 09:37.879
What do you do?

09:38.240 --> 09:39.275
| make food.

09:39.720 --> 09:40.550
You're a cook?

09:40.720 --> 09:44.156
Not anymore. I own a restaurant.

09:44.320 --> 09:47.118
- You did business or culinary school?
- Neither.

09:47.280 --> 09:50.033
I realized I enjoyed
making people happy.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.072
If it's partly down to me,

09:52.760 --> 09:55.115
| feel like I serve a purpose.

09:55.520 --> 09:56.396
Magnificent.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.353
What about you guys?

09:58.560 --> 09:59.834
| sell clothes.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.274
That I choose.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.548
A bit like you,
I enjoy making people happy.

10:05.760 --> 10:08.513
Giving them style, allure, personality.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.229
Solal?

10:12.160 --> 10:14.958
My thing in life
is making myself happy.

10:17.120 --> 10:20.078
So, I do nothing.
That's when I'm happiest.

10:20.240 --> 10:20.990
Right.

10:21.320 --> 10:22.389
And you, Tony?

10:22.600 --> 10:23.715
I'm a lawyer.

10:26.120 --> 10:27.678
You don't run with intellectuals?

10:27.840 --> 10:29.512
It's not that, it's...

10:30.560 --> 10:32.198
- Criminal lawyer?
- Sure.

10:32.360 --> 10:33.236
Criminal law?

10:33.400 --> 10:35.675
- Not only, but some.
- Foosball time.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.832
- You're sick of me talking shop.
- I'm interested.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.708
Make an effort or else it's boring.

10:43.880 --> 10:45.108
If it makes you happy.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.391
So, where did we meet?

10:47.600 --> 10:48.919
We met at

10:49.360 --> 10:50.509
Le Pulp.

10:50.680 --> 10:52.159
- The club?
- Long ago.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.550
l tended bar when l was a student.

10:54.720 --> 10:55.516
Stop.

10:55.680 --> 10:58.638
And I think
you were a solid regular.

10:58.800 --> 11:00.279
Hanging around the bar,

11:00.440 --> 11:03.000
dipping your hand in ice buckets
and doing that...

11:03.600 --> 11:04.669
To the girls.

11:05.720 --> 11:07.517
As if to say, you...

11:07.720 --> 11:09.392
You're going to bed with me.

11:09.600 --> 11:10.555
It worked?

11:10.720 --> 11:12.233
Pretty good, yeah.

11:12.640 --> 11:13.959
So you imitated me.

11:14.120 --> 11:16.873
I thought you'd remember
that we met back then.

11:18.040 --> 11:18.836
Cute.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.276
- But you didn't.
- Not at all, but it worked. Look...

11:23.320 --> 11:24.639
- What?
- What you wanted.

11:25.360 --> 11:28.113
- Breakfast with you is what I wanted?
- Sure.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.519
No, I wanted...

11:54.160 --> 11:55.070
See you.

11:55.440 --> 11:56.395
See you...

11:58.360 --> 11:59.952
Very soon, I hope.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.518
Can I give you my mobile?

12:05.680 --> 12:06.749
If you want.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.035
Catch.

12:12.800 --> 12:13.835
The code

12:14.120 --> 12:15.997
is 1-7-7-6.

12:27.520 --> 12:28.509
He's fantastic.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.028
Yeah, fantastic.

12:30.440 --> 12:31.350
I love him.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.159
You want my mobile?

12:39.840 --> 12:40.670
Catch.

12:42.920 --> 12:44.035
Solal!

12:44.280 --> 12:47.750
How come it works for those guys?
And with me, never!

12:48.320 --> 12:51.118
When you throw her your phone,
she's like...

12:51.680 --> 12:53.591
And you're like...

12:54.280 --> 12:55.633
That's so not true!

13:00.320 --> 13:02.231
Prop your knee back on here.

13:02.920 --> 13:03.670
There.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.756
You want to finish up on your own?

13:13.840 --> 13:15.796
Here, take the shower.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.038
I'm in the next room, okay?

14:02.120 --> 14:03.030
Sit down.

14:19.120 --> 14:20.030
Hey.

14:25.840 --> 14:26.909
You okay?

14:27.080 --> 14:28.035
Good, and you?

14:28.240 --> 14:29.639
Not bad at all.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.552
- Your mobile.
- Thank you.

14:34.720 --> 14:35.994
You didn't miss it?

14:36.600 --> 14:38.079
You didn't miss me?

14:41.400 --> 14:42.071
What's this?

14:42.240 --> 14:43.912
The list of people who called.

14:47.240 --> 14:48.992
Can I get an espresso?

14:49.160 --> 14:50.354
No, sorry, don't.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.755
- We don't have time.
- How come?

14:53.240 --> 14:56.550
I want you to see something, like now.

14:58.080 --> 14:59.274
My dear friends,

14:59.920 --> 15:01.558
we can be fearless

15:01.720 --> 15:02.869
before God.

15:03.080 --> 15:05.594
Whatever we ask,
we shall receive from Him...

15:05.800 --> 15:06.835
Recognize me?

15:11.000 --> 15:11.830
Take a seat.

15:16.680 --> 15:18.079
| see that everybody's here.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.151
lf everybody's in position,

15:20.320 --> 15:21.514
we can go on.

15:21.880 --> 15:22.710
Thanks.

15:23.640 --> 15:26.234
If you'd all please stand...

15:27.600 --> 15:30.160
Marie, before God and your witnesses,

15:32.280 --> 15:34.714
| invite you to take your vows.

15:35.920 --> 15:38.673
Do you take as your husband, Slim,

15:38.840 --> 15:42.116
to love and to hold
till death do you part?

15:44.120 --> 15:45.109
I do.

15:45.680 --> 15:46.874
And you, Slim,

15:47.200 --> 15:48.952
do you take Marie

15:49.240 --> 15:50.275
as your wife,

15:50.680 --> 15:53.433
to love and to hold
till death do you part?

15:53.640 --> 15:54.516
I do.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.192
You don't put it on!

15:58.360 --> 15:59.076
Here.

16:12.560 --> 16:13.834
- Done.
- The kiss!

16:14.000 --> 16:17.390
| now pronounce you husband and wife.

16:42.720 --> 16:43.994
What is it?

16:44.800 --> 16:46.711
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.154
Tell me what's wrong.

16:52.520 --> 16:55.159
You didn't feel that l was...

16:56.640 --> 16:57.709
too...

16:58.040 --> 16:58.995
Too what?

17:00.320 --> 17:01.548
Too open.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.069
Too open?

17:03.640 --> 17:04.709
Minded?

17:07.560 --> 17:09.198
What are you talking about?

17:09.359 --> 17:10.679
Too open where?

17:10.839 --> 17:12.159
Too open inside.

17:12.599 --> 17:13.635
Your pussy?

17:14.839 --> 17:15.715
No.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.114
Not at all.

17:18.520 --> 17:19.999
It was wonderful.

17:22.079 --> 17:24.435
It was perfect, I promise you.

17:25.440 --> 17:26.759
Why'd you say that?

17:29.560 --> 17:31.039
That's why you're crying?

17:32.640 --> 17:33.709
What's wrong?

17:34.400 --> 17:36.038
Somebody told you that?

17:39.920 --> 17:41.194
Who told you that?

17:42.280 --> 17:44.589
Tell me. I'll punch his lights out.

17:44.760 --> 17:45.875
Who said that?

17:46.160 --> 17:48.549
Who's the idiot who told you that?

17:48.840 --> 17:52.150
Only a guy with a small dick
says that, babe.

17:54.560 --> 17:55.879
Your pussy is...

17:57.360 --> 17:58.793
It's like a mouth.

18:00.680 --> 18:01.908
Without teeth.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.149
Just ideal.

18:05.360 --> 18:07.351
A pussy like an old lady's mouth.

18:09.760 --> 18:12.115
- No, seriously.
- Who told you that?

18:12.760 --> 18:13.909
My...

18:14.760 --> 18:16.990
Tell me, which asshole said that?

18:17.200 --> 18:18.189
My ex-husband.

18:18.720 --> 18:19.994
Before he left?

18:20.200 --> 18:21.428
As grounds for...

18:22.440 --> 18:23.316
separation.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.077
Your pussy's like that, ciao.

18:29.840 --> 18:32.673
I gotta go, I found a chick
with one like that.

18:32.840 --> 18:33.955
Right?

18:34.320 --> 18:35.719
- Cool guy.
- Exactly.

18:35.880 --> 18:37.677
You married a great guy.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.878
You've gotta stop
meeting jerks, you know.

18:43.360 --> 18:44.634
You're not a jerk, are you?

18:48.410 --> 18:49.370
No

18:51.880 --> 18:53.598
Huge hesitation.

18:53.760 --> 18:55.637
I'm not a jerk, l'm...

18:56.560 --> 18:57.959
the king of jerks.

18:59.320 --> 19:00.514
Get it?

19:00.680 --> 19:02.079
I thought as much.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.868
I'm the captain, | send them along...

19:12.520 --> 19:13.316
I love you.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.231
You can't love me so soon.

19:17.640 --> 19:18.516
Can't I?

19:19.320 --> 19:20.150
No.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.029
What time is it?

19:24.560 --> 19:25.913
I'll wait ten minutes.

19:26.320 --> 19:28.072
I'm not asking for that much.

19:29.640 --> 19:30.709
Five?

19:42.040 --> 19:44.110
We'll just rotate your leg a little.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.352
You can't extend it further?

19:46.560 --> 19:47.959
That's as far as it goes?

19:48.120 --> 19:49.599
We'll make do with that.

19:49.760 --> 19:51.079
Hold still.

19:51.240 --> 19:53.435
Here we go. Stay very still.

20:02.560 --> 20:03.709
Yes, | see.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.352
The knee's swollen again.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.432
There we are, 60.

20:25.640 --> 20:27.278
Rémi has some work to do.

20:27.880 --> 20:30.553
First to get the swelling down.

20:30.720 --> 20:32.631
Then to recover mobility.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.230
What's up?

20:44.040 --> 20:46.952
- l was passing by.
- You said not to expect you.

20:49.040 --> 20:49.836
Wendy!

20:50.880 --> 20:52.074
- Hey there!
- Hello.

20:52.240 --> 20:53.559
Show the lady...

20:54.160 --> 20:55.195
to table 4.

20:55.720 --> 20:56.550
Evening.

20:56.920 --> 20:59.753
Fire me up another king prawns, please.
For table 8.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.352
We'll take good care of you.

21:06.400 --> 21:07.276
Remember me?

21:08.040 --> 21:09.598
Sure, at the wedding.

21:10.880 --> 21:12.029
And the nightclub.

21:18.200 --> 21:19.315
You smoke?

21:19.600 --> 21:20.271
No.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.557
There's a smoke shop opposite.

21:26.560 --> 21:27.959
You stole my man.

21:28.560 --> 21:31.199
You could at least
buy me a pack of cigarettes.

21:34.880 --> 21:36.950
- What are you doing?
- Chatting.

21:37.120 --> 21:38.075
You need sugar?

21:38.240 --> 21:39.355
On the bar.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.357
| see. I'm not welcome.

21:41.560 --> 21:42.231
Well spotted.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.197
Excuse me. Do your thing.

21:50.080 --> 21:50.956
Cheers!

21:53.680 --> 21:54.829
Who is that girl?

21:55.960 --> 21:56.836
Agnes.

21:57.120 --> 21:58.189
But to you?

21:58.400 --> 22:01.756
We were together five years,
broke up three years ago.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.115
She's a bit strange.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.510
She's not well, on antidepressants.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.797
I've become a kind of brother.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.638
Or mother, I don't know.

22:10.640 --> 22:12.676
She sensed someone new in my life

22:12.920 --> 22:14.751
and she came to stir shit.

22:14.920 --> 22:18.151
It's the first time there's someone new
since you broke up?

22:18.520 --> 22:19.236
Yes.

22:21.960 --> 22:22.949
What's that mean?

22:25.120 --> 22:27.873
You don't meet someone new
every five minutes.

22:28.360 --> 22:29.429
Or I don't.

22:30.560 --> 22:31.675
You, maybe.

22:36.370 --> 22:37.910
On a lighter note,

22:38.200 --> 22:40.350
the chef has prepared for you, miss,

22:41.120 --> 22:44.112
king prawns
roasted in armagnac, Catalan style.

22:44.680 --> 22:45.669
Sound good?

22:48.880 --> 22:50.313
That pot, there.

22:50.520 --> 22:52.192
Gentlemen, you're done. Finished.

22:52.360 --> 22:54.430
- Nearly done.
- No, you're done.

22:54.800 --> 22:55.789
Thank you.

22:58.880 --> 23:00.996
- Enjoy your evening.
- You too.

23:29.040 --> 23:30.519
I want this place tidy!

23:31.040 --> 23:32.917
- Fast.
- What are you doing?

23:33.080 --> 23:34.115
Tidy!

23:34.320 --> 23:35.389
Georgio!

23:37.200 --> 23:38.155
Joseph!

23:38.440 --> 23:39.714
I'd like you to meet

23:39.880 --> 23:41.074
the love of my life!

23:41.400 --> 23:44.039
Welcome to my humble dispensary, miss.

23:44.200 --> 23:45.997
As far as your eye can see,

23:46.160 --> 23:47.912
take whatever you want.

23:48.080 --> 23:49.274
- It's yours.
- Is this yours?

23:49.440 --> 23:50.793
- No, all yours.
- All mine?

23:50.950 --> 23:52.200
Joseph and I

23:53.000 --> 23:54.558
make it our gift to you.

23:55.040 --> 23:57.679
Help yourself.
To creams, to toothbrushes.

23:58.120 --> 23:59.712
To venom pumps!

24:00.080 --> 24:01.752
I'll add it all to his tab.

24:01.920 --> 24:02.875
As usual.

24:03.680 --> 24:04.669
Some Xanax.

24:05.400 --> 24:06.799
Please. Two boxes.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.912
For you? You're on that?

24:09.080 --> 24:10.069
'Course not!

24:10.240 --> 24:11.559
Why do you take that?

24:11.720 --> 24:14.109
Tell me, what about Viagra?

24:14.640 --> 24:15.868
Yes, Viagra.

24:16.360 --> 24:18.078
We have some, naturally.

24:18.250 --> 24:20.580
- I'd like to try.
- Cut it Out.

24:20.760 --> 24:21.715
You want some fun?

24:21.880 --> 24:23.518
- Dangerous for the heart?
- No.

24:23.680 --> 24:25.591
No risks? The liver?

24:25.760 --> 24:26.590
No problem.

24:27.120 --> 24:29.315
- I'll take one box.
- You don't need it.

24:29.520 --> 24:31.511
- How long's it last?
- 12 hours.

24:31.680 --> 24:32.795
12 hours!

24:33.840 --> 24:35.671
- You're getting it?
- I want to try.

24:35.840 --> 24:38.308
- I hear it's...
- Totally. lt's radical.

24:38.520 --> 24:41.751
Puts a spring in your step.
Out in the street, oh, sorry.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.751
You hear about the new one?

24:47.920 --> 24:49.194
It's called Viazac.

24:49.840 --> 24:51.592
A combo of Viagra and Prozac.

24:51.760 --> 24:54.069
You can't get it up,
but you don't care.

24:55.200 --> 24:57.077
For now, just Viagra.

24:57.240 --> 24:58.559
You dated her?

24:58.720 --> 25:00.870
I didn't date her. I met her once...

25:01.040 --> 25:02.439
Georgio, you can tell me.

25:02.640 --> 25:03.516
Yes!

25:03.680 --> 25:05.238
Yes, I slept with her!

25:05.400 --> 25:07.277
But I can't remember her name.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.431
That has to tell you something.

25:11.440 --> 25:12.634
I don't get it.

25:13.960 --> 25:16.076
Besides me, or before me,

25:16.560 --> 25:18.039
you only dated models?

25:18.400 --> 25:19.230
No.

25:19.960 --> 25:21.996
You dated normal girls?

25:22.280 --> 25:23.235
What's normal?

25:23.400 --> 25:25.516
A girl like me. A normal girl.

25:26.160 --> 25:27.513
You think you're normal?

25:27.680 --> 25:29.671
- Sure I am.
- You're not at all normal.

25:29.840 --> 25:31.956
I am. You know what I mean.

25:32.640 --> 25:35.108
Look, l was young, l was stupid.

25:35.280 --> 25:38.875
I wanted to date beautiful women
to feel good about myself.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.913
Some folks, it's cars.
Me, it was models.

25:43.080 --> 25:44.513
That's all, it's no...

25:45.360 --> 25:46.839
It's pretty shallow.

25:47.400 --> 25:48.276
See...

25:51.680 --> 25:52.874
Listen.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.915
- I prefer a girl like you.
- Yeah, I bet.

25:57.080 --> 25:59.071
To a whole harem of them.

25:59.240 --> 26:00.434
- Really?
- Yes.

26:19.240 --> 26:21.913
Are you comfortable there? Need a hand?

26:22.680 --> 26:24.352
I'll bring you the menu.

26:50.720 --> 26:52.836
- What are you doing?
- lroning.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.228
What's going on?

26:54.800 --> 26:55.949
I need to relax.

26:56.120 --> 26:57.439
I'm on edge, can't sleep.

26:57.640 --> 26:58.675
Anything wrong?

27:01.560 --> 27:03.232
I want a baby from you.

27:06.160 --> 27:07.832
Don't laugh when I say that.

27:08.960 --> 27:09.949
Don't laugh!

27:12.120 --> 27:13.997
I want a baby from you, seriously.

27:14.320 --> 27:18.359
I want a little guy or girl,
whatever comes along.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.158
With your face, your eyes.

27:22.320 --> 27:23.958
With your crappy moods.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.397
Let's discuss it tomorrow.

27:28.600 --> 27:31.592
- It's not an urge, it's a need.
- It is an urge.

27:32.880 --> 27:34.313
I never wanted one.

27:34.600 --> 27:37.273
It meant nothing to me.
Now, I'm ready.

27:37.440 --> 27:39.908
We'll see
if you're still ready tomorrow.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.791
You're out of your mind!

27:43.760 --> 27:45.796
- You're not laughing now.
- You madman!

27:45.960 --> 27:48.952
You're gonna make me a baby?
Make me a baby!

27:50.000 --> 27:51.513
Come to bed.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.279
You go. I'll do some shirts.

27:53.440 --> 27:54.998
No, come to bed with me.

27:56.000 --> 27:56.750
Come on.

27:56.920 --> 27:59.070
- Sure you'll sleep?
- I think so, yes.

27:59.240 --> 28:01.435
- You think so?
- Yes, with Iron Man.

28:01.640 --> 28:02.436
Oh yeah?

28:02.920 --> 28:04.069
- Okay, sure.
- Sure what?

28:04.240 --> 28:06.435
- Hand back my shorts.
- Okay.

28:08.400 --> 28:10.834
On the subject,
"Must You Ruin Everything?"

28:11.160 --> 28:14.152
the next speaker is Ms. Tony Jezequel

28:14.880 --> 28:16.313
for the opposition.

28:21.960 --> 28:23.518
Hypocritical Secretaries,

28:24.360 --> 28:26.032
friends and brothers,

28:27.640 --> 28:29.358
must you ruin everything?

28:30.800 --> 28:32.756
As if the world were new?

28:33.400 --> 28:35.118
As if it were the ﬁrst morning?

28:35.960 --> 28:37.712
As if it were still dawn ?

28:37.880 --> 28:39.233
Can he still catch up?

28:39.640 --> 28:41.232
Let me get into the horse's head.

28:47.840 --> 28:49.990
The truth, honorable Secretaries,

28:50.520 --> 28:52.636
is that what has already been ruined,

28:53.400 --> 28:55.516
our founding disillusion,

28:56.680 --> 28:57.908
is our freedom.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.355
We won!

29:07.760 --> 29:11.435
You must have nothing to lose
to love heart and soul.

29:12.080 --> 29:15.868
You must eclipse the giddiest heights
to dare to plunge headlong.

29:22.440 --> 29:26.035
You must endure the fall of empires
and the greatest storms

29:27.440 --> 29:29.396
to be together in that moment.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.278
You must have lived,

29:34.680 --> 29:36.033
you must have lost,

29:36.200 --> 29:37.679
o i/er and again,

29:38.840 --> 29:40.637
to triumph with you.

29:42.440 --> 29:45.989
Love is nothing
when it’s new, clean and pure.

29:47.080 --> 29:49.355
Love before the storm
is not a decision.

29:49.560 --> 29:50.390
It’s a decree.

29:52.800 --> 29:56.270
When the event,
accident or opportunity occurs,

29:56.440 --> 29:57.395
be there.

29:58.560 --> 29:59.629
Standing.

30:00.760 --> 30:02.716
Find the word, action or look.

30:04.720 --> 30:05.869
Yes, my love,

30:06.400 --> 30:07.753
in that moment,

30:08.320 --> 30:09.639
rely on me.

30:10.240 --> 30:11.673
I won't go missing.

30:12.200 --> 30:13.553
At that minute,

30:14.560 --> 30:15.754
I'll be there.

30:17.400 --> 30:18.549
And so,

30:19.120 --> 30:20.599
I predict,

30:22.160 --> 30:23.991
we shall be the winners.

30:36.720 --> 30:39.837
All is lost, for nothing is won.
Where are you?

30:41.000 --> 30:41.716
My love,

30:42.920 --> 30:45.957
a mouth, a second, a touch.
I'll be there.

30:46.440 --> 30:48.874
I saw your aside to Georgio.
Where are you?

30:49.040 --> 30:49.950
Here!

30:50.120 --> 30:51.075
There.

30:51.240 --> 30:52.639
Was I so ridiculous?

30:54.640 --> 30:55.959
Not ridiculous, theatrical.

30:56.200 --> 30:59.795
Listen. It wasn't ridiculous,
it was super moving.

30:59.960 --> 31:03.316
I felt I was seeing
a part of you for the first time.

31:04.040 --> 31:06.315
It was magnificent, beautiful even.

31:06.880 --> 31:10.190
- I had you in tears too?
- Quit poking fun at her!

31:10.360 --> 31:14.148
It's beautiful, she gave of herself.
She took a risk in life!

31:14.320 --> 31:15.116
Your caviar.

31:16.880 --> 31:18.074
With an egg?

31:18.640 --> 31:19.959
Maybe with the beluga.

31:20.120 --> 31:21.269
The beluga!

31:21.440 --> 31:23.670
This is the best caviar
or there's better?

31:24.000 --> 31:27.595
Best doesn't mean anything in caviar.
It's the size of the eggs

31:27.920 --> 31:29.239
that makes the difference.

31:29.400 --> 31:32.073
Fact is,
caviar comes from saltwater sturgeon...

31:32.240 --> 31:32.990
Not only.

31:33.640 --> 31:35.710
- They're freshwater fish?
- They're both.

31:36.040 --> 31:36.711
Wanna bet?

31:36.880 --> 31:38.632
Sir, we need your expertise.

31:38.960 --> 31:39.790
500.

31:41.640 --> 31:42.868
Okay, tell me...

31:43.160 --> 31:45.515
Sturgeons live in the sea, right?

31:46.440 --> 31:48.351
Actually, in both habitats.

31:48.560 --> 31:50.152
Salt water and fresh water.

31:50.640 --> 31:51.436
Fine.

31:51.640 --> 31:52.311
Here...

31:52.840 --> 31:54.398
You big fat tart.

31:57.360 --> 31:58.554
You take his money?

31:58.720 --> 32:00.119
Of course. I won it.

32:00.280 --> 32:01.713
It's a game, Solal.

32:06.640 --> 32:08.119
Are you not feeling well?

32:08.280 --> 32:10.794
Fat tart's cute, like sweettart.

32:10.960 --> 32:13.918
No, it means what it says.
Big fat whore.

32:14.080 --> 32:17.038
I'm not smart enough
to understand the difference.

32:17.320 --> 32:18.992
Chug that caviar!

32:19.320 --> 32:22.995
I didn't say that.
| just said your style's medieval.

32:23.720 --> 32:25.950
I'd love to be someone's big fat tart.

32:26.280 --> 32:27.759
Don't come crying to us.

32:30.880 --> 32:33.110
C'mon, you play sex games
with your wife or...

32:33.280 --> 32:34.713
- I doubt it.
- Sure they do.

32:34.880 --> 32:35.790
She coats my...

32:35.960 --> 32:37.439
hair with sunflower oil.

32:45.080 --> 32:46.195
She's not my fat tart.

32:46.360 --> 32:47.554
What's that ring?

32:47.720 --> 32:48.755
A gift from Babeth.

32:48.960 --> 32:50.313
What's written on it?

32:50.960 --> 32:54.111
I had it engraved
with a sublime letter he wrote me.

32:54.280 --> 32:56.430
- The whole letter? The full text?
- Yes.

32:56.720 --> 32:57.709
Beautiful.

32:58.640 --> 33:00.312
Babeth and l are going...

33:00.520 --> 33:01.316
Up the aisle?

33:01.520 --> 33:03.829
Not going up the aisle,
rolling in the aisles!

33:06.040 --> 33:08.315
- Let's look together.
- No, I'm looking!

33:09.120 --> 33:10.269
We look together.

33:10.440 --> 33:11.714
It says you're pregnant?

33:11.920 --> 33:13.069
How many lines?

33:15.920 --> 33:16.636
Two lines.

33:16.800 --> 33:18.631
- You're pregnant?
- I'm pregnant?

33:18.800 --> 33:19.915
I'm pregnant.

33:28.520 --> 33:29.748
I'm pregnant!

33:33.440 --> 33:34.953
Thank you, you're pregnant.

33:35.400 --> 33:36.515
You're pleased?

33:37.200 --> 33:38.030
Yes.

33:41.000 --> 33:41.989
You okay?

33:42.640 --> 33:43.595
Are you okay?

33:43.760 --> 33:45.352
I can feel my ribcage

33:46.280 --> 33:47.679
constricting.

33:50.720 --> 33:52.039
How old is it now?

33:52.200 --> 33:53.758
Maybe one month.

33:54.320 --> 33:55.309
One month old?

33:56.040 --> 33:57.996
Hold on, it's this big.

33:58.160 --> 33:59.195
A marble.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.152
Sweetheart,

34:13.320 --> 34:15.958
I never said I wasn't happy with Daddy.

34:16.199 --> 34:19.510
We were very happy, your dad and me,
we had a lot of fun.

34:20.440 --> 34:22.078
We did crazy things.

34:22.560 --> 34:26.438
But, at some point,
it all stopped being fun.

34:27.440 --> 34:31.319
Yes, grownups are complicated.
That's why I tell you to enjoy it.

34:31.520 --> 34:33.511
Make the most of your childhood.

34:33.679 --> 34:35.750
Later, it starts getting complicated.

34:36.360 --> 34:37.793
Okay, in that case,

34:38.000 --> 34:41.036
hang up like Daddy said
and we'll talk tomorrow.

34:42.159 --> 34:42.831
I love you.

34:44.639 --> 34:45.550
Bye.

35:07.760 --> 35:09.512
Georgio Milevski,

35:09.680 --> 35:11.875
do you take
as your lawful wedded wife

35:12.040 --> 35:15.032
Marie-Antoinette Jezequel?

35:15.840 --> 35:16.431
I do.

35:16.640 --> 35:18.392
Marie-Antoinette Jezequel,

35:19.240 --> 35:21.674
do you take
as your lawful wedded husband

35:21.840 --> 35:24.274
Georgio Milevski?

35:31.280 --> 35:32.269
I don't.

35:36.040 --> 35:36.995
I do.

35:40.960 --> 35:43.076
I hear you came without rings.

35:44.880 --> 35:46.916
- Us?
- You're the bride and groom.

35:47.320 --> 35:48.639
We didn't want any.

35:48.800 --> 35:50.233
l pronounce you

35:50.400 --> 35:51.992
husband and wife.

36:25.160 --> 36:28.516
What were Georgio and Tony
doing on top of the cake?

36:28.680 --> 36:30.159
Naughty newlyweds!

36:39.000 --> 36:40.274
To the happy couple!

36:44.080 --> 36:45.832
I'd love some salami.

36:46.080 --> 36:47.832
Does Georgio Milevski,

36:48.120 --> 36:49.758
to whom I give my sister...

36:50.720 --> 36:51.709
Bullshit.

36:52.720 --> 36:53.755
Temporarily.

36:53.920 --> 36:56.354
I'd like to know, how come no rings?

36:56.560 --> 36:59.358
We don't need rings, this is the future.

37:08.160 --> 37:10.515
It's called
consumm-eating your marriage!

37:10.680 --> 37:12.591
Tony! Cut the damn thing.

37:32.720 --> 37:33.630
Agnes!

37:33.800 --> 37:35.199
Agnes, dammit!

37:43.240 --> 37:44.195
Holy shit!

37:45.920 --> 37:47.433
Sir, leave this to us.

37:49.440 --> 37:51.078
We have the tablets here.

37:51.240 --> 37:53.629
Miss, if you hear me, squeeze my hand.

37:53.880 --> 37:56.952
- Fuck!
- I told you to keep an eye on her.

37:57.760 --> 37:58.909
She's breathing?

37:59.680 --> 38:02.035
- Is she breathing?
- Just a second, sir.

38:02.200 --> 38:03.679
Watch out, the knife.

38:06.280 --> 38:07.315
Okay, she's breathing.

38:08.760 --> 38:10.034
She's breathing.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.398
Ready? Lift!

38:26.920 --> 38:28.638
- Where'll you take her?
- Cochin.

38:28.800 --> 38:30.597
No, the American Hospital.

38:30.760 --> 38:32.034
I know a guy there.

38:33.240 --> 38:34.434
You're family? A friend?

38:34.640 --> 38:35.629
A friend.

38:36.560 --> 38:39.233
Do you know
if she's on antidepressants or anything?

38:39.400 --> 38:41.914
Abilify, 5 mg. Three times a day.

38:42.080 --> 38:43.991
- l'll pack a bag for her.
- Please.

38:45.200 --> 38:47.509
- Her doctor prescribed it?
- Dr. Ménes.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.674
Various narcotics, happy pills.

38:51.840 --> 38:54.912
- Such as?
- Cocaine, MDMA, ecstasy.

38:55.200 --> 38:55.996
Amphetamines.

39:20.720 --> 39:21.709
I'm okay.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.278
You know why she did it?

39:29.000 --> 39:30.035
Do you?

39:30.640 --> 39:31.436
Yes.

39:31.840 --> 39:32.670
Why?

39:35.680 --> 39:37.113
I told her you were pregnant.

39:42.440 --> 39:45.955
So the baby is head down,
which is favorable.

39:46.120 --> 39:48.236
Can you put the heart on again?

39:48.400 --> 39:50.994
It won't be long now. Here it comes.

39:51.360 --> 39:51.997
See?

39:52.920 --> 39:55.388
Abdomen, a limb, brain...

40:04.800 --> 40:07.109
Everything's fine. Nothing to report.

40:07.280 --> 40:08.918
Everything's just fine.

40:09.440 --> 40:11.954
He's a little bit emotional because...

40:12.120 --> 40:14.190
That's a good thing. It's good.

40:14.560 --> 40:15.595
Shimon Peres.

40:15.760 --> 40:18.320
The first ever ultrasound
by Shimon Peres.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.238
- You know, don't you?
- Yes.

40:23.720 --> 40:26.393
We don't want to know. No telling, okay?

40:26.640 --> 40:27.675
Big nose...

40:30.560 --> 40:31.629
Say it.

40:32.640 --> 40:34.631
With your head. Nod yes or...

40:35.320 --> 40:37.675
- Was that a wink?
- You don't want to hear.

40:37.840 --> 40:38.955
Don't say it.

40:39.400 --> 40:40.515
Mime it.

40:42.880 --> 40:44.711
Don't tell me if you know.

40:44.880 --> 40:46.518
At any rate, he's...

40:47.040 --> 40:48.314
It's very beautiful.

40:48.560 --> 40:49.549
Our baby.

40:51.360 --> 40:53.112
Can we circumcise immediately?

40:53.680 --> 40:56.319
Who knows
if there's anything to circumcise?

40:57.200 --> 41:00.272
- What makes you think it's a boy?
- I don't know. He said he.

41:00.440 --> 41:01.634
He said it. The baby.

41:01.800 --> 41:03.233
That's it, baby.

41:06.920 --> 41:07.750
Sorry.

41:07.920 --> 41:10.673
No, I think it's wonderful. Very good.

41:19.640 --> 41:20.834
She's awake?

41:22.960 --> 41:23.995
Is she conscious?

41:25.520 --> 41:27.033
What's the doctor say?

41:28.920 --> 41:30.512
What does the doctor say?

41:32.200 --> 41:33.918
Has she eaten anything?

41:34.560 --> 41:35.709
No, you go.

41:36.040 --> 41:37.155
Call me after.

41:37.640 --> 41:40.518
So it's just a matter of options.

41:40.680 --> 41:41.954
And design.

41:42.320 --> 41:43.799
The color's not an issue.

41:44.840 --> 41:46.831
Wheels, rocking or standard.

41:47.000 --> 41:47.989
Okay.

41:50.880 --> 41:51.869
Well?

41:52.840 --> 41:54.034
Like she said...

41:55.000 --> 41:56.399
Which do you prefer?

41:58.640 --> 42:01.029
If it's too deep, you hurt your back.

42:02.280 --> 42:03.713
The height's adjustable.

42:05.760 --> 42:07.159
Look, honestly...

42:09.280 --> 42:11.669
I don't care. Get whichever you want.

42:11.840 --> 42:14.070
Seriously, wheels, rocking...

42:14.960 --> 42:16.916
Right, that one.

42:17.080 --> 42:18.149
There you go.

42:21.520 --> 42:22.509
What about...

42:23.640 --> 42:24.675
You're awake?

42:25.760 --> 42:27.716
Give me a second, I'll call you back.

42:30.640 --> 42:32.198
Get the one you want.

42:33.400 --> 42:34.150
You choose.

42:34.320 --> 42:35.958
I'll be on the phone.

42:40.560 --> 42:41.549
Georgio!

42:59.320 --> 43:00.309
lt's Agnes.

43:11.400 --> 43:12.913
You took your pills?

43:14.240 --> 43:15.673
Why? What's wrong?

43:20.280 --> 43:21.429
Sleep. I'll be back.

43:43.440 --> 43:44.953
Just practice flexing it.

43:45.120 --> 43:47.509
Go as far as you can without pain.

43:47.680 --> 43:50.592
If it hurts,
you let it straighten up again.

43:55.040 --> 43:57.952
I'm here for six weeks, all in all.

43:58.560 --> 43:59.436
You?

43:59.680 --> 44:02.433
Five.
But I'll go mad cooped up here.

44:02.880 --> 44:06.873
When I leave here,
you think I'll be walking?

44:07.040 --> 44:07.677
Sure.

44:08.280 --> 44:09.599
You're nuts.

44:09.840 --> 44:11.751
You'll never walk in 5 weeks.

44:11.920 --> 44:12.670
She will.

44:12.840 --> 44:15.035
Cruciate rehab?
6 months to 4 years.

44:15.200 --> 44:16.030
What?

44:16.240 --> 44:18.037
If she's lucky, Nabil.

44:18.800 --> 44:21.997
It's at least 2 years. Seriously.

44:22.160 --> 44:25.152
- The doctors are bullshitting me?
- They're kidding you!

44:25.400 --> 44:27.789
She's no athlete,
she's not 20 anymore.

44:28.280 --> 44:30.748
Hold on, I'm not saying you're old.

44:31.440 --> 44:33.396
Straight up, it's true about your knee.

44:33.600 --> 44:34.350
The minimum?

44:34.560 --> 44:37.597
To walk as if nothing had ever happened?

44:38.320 --> 44:39.309
Now that's...

44:39.960 --> 44:41.518
That'd be freaky.

44:41.920 --> 44:42.955
Man overboard!

44:46.680 --> 44:48.591
Know who I had dinner with yesterday?

44:49.120 --> 44:49.836
No.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.115
Your father.

44:51.880 --> 44:53.757
He calls me every Sunday.

44:56.200 --> 44:59.158
To see how I'm doing. If I'm holding up.

44:59.840 --> 45:02.035
He always said he likes you a lot.

45:02.200 --> 45:03.838
We like each other a lot.

45:04.440 --> 45:06.032
He'd really like

45:07.280 --> 45:08.838
to see you more often.

45:10.240 --> 45:11.355
I take note.

45:11.560 --> 45:14.597
I'll do all I can
to rectify the situation,

45:14.760 --> 45:17.832
which I would rather
not have neglected in recent months.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.831
You mean me or him?

45:20.320 --> 45:22.117
In this instance, my father.

45:22.280 --> 45:23.508
It's becoming a habit.

45:23.800 --> 45:24.596
To?

45:25.120 --> 45:29.272
To have to rectify situations
neglected for months and months.

45:56.400 --> 45:57.549
Where are you?

46:01.840 --> 46:02.829
Okay.

46:05.560 --> 46:06.549
Bye.

46:24.560 --> 46:25.549
Please...

46:26.120 --> 46:27.633
It's okay, I give up.

46:27.800 --> 46:29.711
I give up looking after her.

46:29.880 --> 46:30.995
No more.

46:32.000 --> 46:32.955
Hear me?

46:33.560 --> 46:36.711
I had to look after her one last time.
Now, no more.

46:37.160 --> 46:38.149
Tony, please.

46:38.520 --> 46:39.953
Listen to me.

46:42.760 --> 46:44.512
l have a right to your attention.

46:44.680 --> 46:47.114
No, your credit's run out. It's over.

46:47.280 --> 46:49.032
Finished. I'm leaving you.

46:53.080 --> 46:55.080
You can't leave me like this.

46:55.160 --> 46:58.232
- Just because I'm a bit late.
- Just because you're late?

46:58.960 --> 47:00.439
- You're shitting me?
- No.

47:00.640 --> 47:04.599
You don't think I'm leaving you
because you're late? Seriously?

47:04.760 --> 47:07.433
I think
you're deciding this tonight...

47:07.640 --> 47:08.868
Or decided tonight...

47:09.040 --> 47:10.359
l'm deciding tonight

47:10.560 --> 47:14.030
after it's escalated
for many long weeks and months.

47:14.200 --> 47:15.792
And l was very patient.

47:18.400 --> 47:19.310
Look".

47:20.040 --> 47:21.393
I won't look after her anymore.

47:21.600 --> 47:24.717
It's too late.
I don't give a damn about her.

47:25.200 --> 47:28.909
I couldn't leave the girl to croak.
Get it?

47:33.160 --> 47:34.195
Don't go.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.319
Stop, please.

47:42.920 --> 47:43.796
Stop!

47:44.120 --> 47:45.792
You have to eat something.

47:46.040 --> 47:47.678
Look on the bright side.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.149
Right now...

47:50.440 --> 47:51.555
you're sad.

47:52.040 --> 47:54.110
But, and there is a but,

47:55.120 --> 47:56.394
you're better off alone.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.831
It's like in the Leo Ferré song.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.195
"As time goes, everything goes.

48:04.240 --> 48:06.435
"The lost years have left you gray.

48:06.880 --> 48:07.995
"You're alone but...

48:08.160 --> 48:08.956
"At peace!"

48:11.240 --> 48:13.071
l was upset, I'm sorry.

48:14.920 --> 48:16.035
I got that.

48:19.320 --> 48:20.150
And?

48:21.640 --> 48:22.868
And I apologize.

48:25.320 --> 48:27.276
Thanks, but it makes no difference.

48:29.000 --> 48:29.876
To what?

48:30.280 --> 48:31.838
l have to look after her.

48:37.520 --> 48:40.273
So last night
when you said you'd stop,

48:40.440 --> 48:42.032
it was just to calm me down?

48:42.400 --> 48:43.389
No.

48:43.840 --> 48:47.355
Last night l'd no idea
you could treat me like shit.

48:47.560 --> 48:50.154
- l was upset. I apologize.
- You're often upset.

48:50.320 --> 48:51.548
l have to look after her.

48:51.720 --> 48:53.711
You don't have to look after her.

48:54.520 --> 48:57.910
I understand, she's in a bad way.
It's horrible.

48:58.080 --> 49:00.389
But I don't see
why you have to look after her.

49:00.600 --> 49:03.034
She'll go to a facility
where they'll look after her.

49:05.560 --> 49:06.959
Subject closed.

49:08.520 --> 49:10.875
The subject is closed.

49:11.840 --> 49:13.432
l have to look after her.

49:14.400 --> 49:16.868
And nothing will stop me.

49:19.400 --> 49:20.435
Is that clear?

50:19.040 --> 50:21.395
I cry for no reason, I...

50:22.720 --> 50:24.836
I can't sleep anymore.

50:25.200 --> 50:26.918
I lose my temper easily.

50:28.080 --> 50:30.196
I'm scared the baby will feel it.

50:30.600 --> 50:33.592
I want him to feel
his mom's in a good place.

50:33.760 --> 50:36.194
I mean, happy, calm...

50:36.440 --> 50:37.793
In that case,

50:37.960 --> 50:41.430
from your description
of these moods' duration and intensity,

50:41.640 --> 50:42.959
I think it's...

50:44.320 --> 50:47.437
It's preferable
that I should intervene medically,

50:47.640 --> 50:50.518
with solutions
that involve medication, of course,

50:50.680 --> 50:52.875
to allow you to feel better.

50:54.720 --> 50:58.554
We're talking medication
that's absolutely harmless for the child.

50:59.320 --> 51:00.514
What do you think?

51:01.120 --> 51:01.996
I don't know.

51:02.160 --> 51:03.388
How about we try it?

51:07.200 --> 51:08.758
For a pregnant woman

51:09.160 --> 51:12.391
to have these ups and downs
in her behavior,

51:12.600 --> 51:13.874
is that the baby blues?

51:14.040 --> 51:15.792
No, that comes after the birth.

51:15.960 --> 51:17.757
There's more afterwards?

51:18.200 --> 51:19.918
Baby blues is a depression

51:20.080 --> 51:21.672
that occurs after the birth.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.194
That'll be fun.

51:29.880 --> 51:32.348
- Can I see you a moment?
- Of course.

51:32.560 --> 51:33.515
Be right there.

51:41.560 --> 51:43.551
I love you. I want this child.

51:44.840 --> 51:46.956
But 24/7 with you is beyond me.

51:49.040 --> 51:50.792
So I've found a little place,

51:51.280 --> 51:53.032
just there, right there,

51:53.560 --> 51:55.232
maybe three doors down,

51:55.600 --> 51:56.919
on the same block.

51:57.200 --> 51:59.111
No need to cross the street even.

51:59.520 --> 52:00.270
Furnished.

52:01.280 --> 52:04.033
I'll take some underwear
and a toothbrush,

52:04.200 --> 52:06.270
for when I've no time to come by.

52:06.440 --> 52:07.873
I'll be here all the time.

52:08.040 --> 52:10.554
But when I need space or we fight,

52:10.720 --> 52:12.995
when we get in each other's faces...

52:16.680 --> 52:18.796
The doctor says it's a good idea.

52:23.040 --> 52:26.077
That it's pointless
creating stress for no reason.

52:26.680 --> 52:28.113
When are you leaving?

52:29.080 --> 52:31.799
I think the landlord can give me the keys

52:31.960 --> 52:33.313
early next week.

52:35.120 --> 52:38.396
It'll be better.
For you, me and most of all the baby.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.389
We'll only have
the good times together.

52:41.960 --> 52:45.669
We'll be happy to see each other,
we'll laugh. We've lost that.

53:23.200 --> 53:23.996
You okay?

53:25.040 --> 53:25.870
No, not okay.

53:30.760 --> 53:31.875
This is it.

53:33.000 --> 53:36.788
Basically, it's an office,
with a bedroom back there.

53:37.600 --> 53:39.033
Look, check it out.

53:42.160 --> 53:45.311
For if you ever
sleep over with the baby.

53:45.520 --> 53:49.354
Or if you're at the office
and | stay here to work,

53:49.560 --> 53:50.675
I look after the baby.

53:52.520 --> 53:53.635
There you go.

53:54.120 --> 53:56.793
For me to stay here
it had to be offices,

53:56.960 --> 54:00.396
and I met a guy
who's got a lot of talent

54:01.120 --> 54:03.350
and wanted
to go into business with him...

54:03.560 --> 54:04.436
Win-win.

54:05.160 --> 54:05.990
Not bad, huh?

54:06.160 --> 54:07.991
A kitchenette over there.

54:15.120 --> 54:16.997
And this is my brother-in-law.

54:17.600 --> 54:18.271
Solal.

54:22.400 --> 54:23.879
You stocked up on wine.

54:28.120 --> 54:30.839
Stocked up?
l have a few bottles of wine...

54:33.520 --> 54:35.670
You know,
for business meals and stuff,

54:35.840 --> 54:37.432
I need the bare minimum.

54:44.440 --> 54:46.192
And all these glasses and plates?

54:46.400 --> 54:48.311
If you're in a bad mood,
come back later.

54:48.760 --> 54:49.670
I'm in a bad mood?

54:49.840 --> 54:50.670
Who knows...

54:52.800 --> 54:54.119
I'm in a bad mood?

54:55.320 --> 54:57.311
Quit fucking with me!

54:58.080 --> 54:59.069
Let me go!

54:59.240 --> 54:59.877
Stop it.

55:00.040 --> 55:01.951
Quit fucking with me!

55:02.720 --> 55:03.948
Can't you stop a second?

55:04.120 --> 55:05.519
Check her hand!

55:05.680 --> 55:07.079
Let go of me!

55:07.240 --> 55:08.355
You cut your hand?

55:08.560 --> 55:09.709
Let me go!

55:09.880 --> 55:12.075
Give her a break, you jerk!

55:12.440 --> 55:13.919
Come on, let's go!

55:26.880 --> 55:31.192
Good morning, Mr. Larcher and Mr. Colin,
here on orders of the court.

55:31.400 --> 55:33.868
Do Mr. and Mrs. Milevski live here?

55:34.680 --> 55:36.079
May I come in, please?

55:37.680 --> 55:41.036
Mr. Milevski is legally bound
to repay a considerable sum

55:41.200 --> 55:44.272
and we're here
to proceed with repossession.

55:44.560 --> 55:45.197
Come in.

55:45.400 --> 55:47.072
The locksmith and movers.

55:47.520 --> 55:49.272
Could we just close the door?

55:51.120 --> 55:55.432
Mr. Colin will repossess
the items of furniture listed here.

55:55.720 --> 55:57.438
We'll start right away.

56:00.000 --> 56:01.638
Please take a seat, ma'am.

56:03.920 --> 56:04.955
Please...

56:05.920 --> 56:07.797
We'll start with the inlaid table.

56:08.680 --> 56:10.079
Wrap it up a little.

56:11.280 --> 56:12.554
That table's mine.

56:12.720 --> 56:15.837
- In what sense?
- lt belonged to my great-grandmother.

56:16.080 --> 56:20.232
Ma'am, by decision of the court,
both spouses are liable for the debt.

56:20.400 --> 56:22.038
l've inventoried the furniture.

56:22.200 --> 56:25.158
Unfortunately,
all the furniture will have to go.

56:25.800 --> 56:28.439
I'm sorry, but it's the law.
l have no choice.

56:28.640 --> 56:29.834
Go ahead, gentlemen.

56:31.280 --> 56:32.679
Bubble-wrap it.

56:33.400 --> 56:36.676
Those two cabinets and the dresser.

56:36.840 --> 56:37.795
And the table.

56:39.080 --> 56:41.435
Let's start on the bedroom now.

56:42.640 --> 56:43.789
The television, please.

56:49.800 --> 56:50.869
Shit!

56:54.440 --> 56:56.192
The little fuckers!

57:06.840 --> 57:07.511
I'm sorry.

57:07.680 --> 57:10.558
I know it can't be
very easy for you right now

57:11.760 --> 57:13.830
to have stuff like this happen.

57:14.720 --> 57:16.711
| signed the documents, I...

57:17.120 --> 57:19.031
I thought it was an empty threat.

57:20.400 --> 57:21.389
You see?

57:24.440 --> 57:25.429
I'm sorry.

57:29.440 --> 57:31.396
You're mad about your furniture?

57:33.080 --> 57:34.195
Stuff you liked?

57:35.920 --> 57:39.230
It's all in a warehouse
and we have a month to buy it back.

57:39.400 --> 57:41.391
I'll pay and we'll pick it up.

57:41.960 --> 57:43.313
They'll give it back.

57:43.600 --> 57:45.272
The rest was mine, so screw that.

57:45.440 --> 57:47.715
I kind of like this Japanese vibe.

58:03.160 --> 58:04.991
You need to save your skin.

58:07.800 --> 58:10.109
I didn't wait all these years

58:10.600 --> 58:12.113
to have a child,

58:13.240 --> 58:14.753
only to bail out

58:16.240 --> 58:19.118
just when I'll have a family at last.

58:24.840 --> 58:26.398
Call that a Kleenex?

58:27.440 --> 58:29.032
It's a sponge.

58:30.000 --> 58:30.989
Blow.

58:32.200 --> 58:33.428
Blow!

58:33.920 --> 58:34.875
Not so hard.

58:35.400 --> 58:37.436
You'll blast it everywhere. Blow.

58:38.040 --> 58:39.268
That's disgusting.

58:40.280 --> 58:43.431
I don't believe this.
I've totally got a...

58:43.640 --> 58:45.870
Worse than a hospital case.

58:52.360 --> 58:53.270
Thanks.

58:55.320 --> 58:56.878
Where do you want to sit?

58:58.360 --> 58:59.190
There.

58:59.400 --> 59:00.674
- Here?
- Sure.

59:01.760 --> 59:02.988
Make some room.

59:06.840 --> 59:08.558
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

59:08.720 --> 59:11.996
Folks fresh off the slab
are here in post-op.

59:12.160 --> 59:13.639
- Zombies.
- That's phase 1.

59:13.800 --> 59:15.392
They sleep all day long.

59:15.600 --> 59:18.160
- Then comes semi-renfo.
- Phase 2.

59:18.320 --> 59:20.117
You have limited mobility.

59:20.280 --> 59:22.032
- Then renfo.
- Phase 3.

59:22.240 --> 59:24.071
- You're phase 3?
- Phase 2.

59:24.880 --> 59:26.757
- l'm phase 2.
- He's terminal phase.

59:28.640 --> 59:30.153
He's nearly done.

59:30.320 --> 59:32.151
He'll head back to his village.

59:32.560 --> 59:33.959
Know his zip code? 7-1.

59:34.760 --> 59:35.795
You live in 7-1?

59:36.680 --> 59:37.829
In the provinces?

59:41.000 --> 59:42.877
- Where are you from?
- Burgundy.

59:43.160 --> 59:47.199
- Dude, Burgundy's in the provinces.
- Provinces is down south, fool.

59:47.360 --> 59:48.395
lt's down south?

59:48.600 --> 59:51.034
The provinces
is the bit around Marseille.

59:51.200 --> 59:52.872
So what do you call up north?

59:53.080 --> 59:54.911
That's Metropolis.

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.149
Wassup, nigga!

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:03.635
I'll put him on.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:04.835
Francois Hollande.

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:11.836
We're gonna hang out together.

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:14.159
For sure. Dope.

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.436
How come you're Arab with straight hair?

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.278
- I'm not Arab.
- You're not?

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.999
- What are you?
- French.

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.114
He says I'm Arab.

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.714
- You look Arab.
- Spanish, I'd say.

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.393
See? Spanish, Portuguese...

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.431
His hair and body are out of sync.

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:31.757
Yours is in sync with your body?

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:34.355
l have kinky hair and I'm proud of it.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.709
It's like a sponge.

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.438
Arabs have kinky hair.

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:41.315
He's got whitey's hair.
Call his hair Francois, his body Omar.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:44.358
Call his hair Francois!

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:46.273
I prefer my tuft to that.

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:50.673
Keep strutting, little man!

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:53.035
- I got you down.
- You see a woman and floss.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:07.233
What are you doing here?

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.359
You want something from me?

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:13.551
No, nothing, don't worry.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.151
- Something to tell me?
- Not either.

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.158
Happy your furniture's back?

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.270
What?

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:47.953
Hello, beautiful beloved.

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:49.348
How are you?

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.352
I missed you terribly.

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.314
I missed everything.

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:57.275
Your laugh.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:59.556
I even missed your sulking.

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:08.994
This isn't very...

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.518
It's not very sensible.

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:37.268
My waters have broken.

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:41.679
The child's coming?

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:45.109
- Is it moving?
- I'm not having contractions.

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.236
- There have to be contractions?
- Yes.

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:48.789
Let's go.

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:50.873
Let's go to the clinic.

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.236
Come on...

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:53.829
I'll call them.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.069
Don't make any...

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:57.836
- Sudden movements.
- No, not in black.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.036
- Don't start.
- I know what I'll wear.

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:03.033
Screw that,
we don't have time. Hold still!

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:06.558
No dresses today.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:07.596
Please.

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.193
- Get dressed.
- Calm down.

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:10.110
You calm down.

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:31.031
He said hello.

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:33.952
Look, he's looking at you!

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.076
Holy shit!

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.071
It really is a boy.

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.269
Welcome to you.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.513
It's Mommy and Daddy.

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:50.075
- Welcome, my love.
- Mommy and Daddy.

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.798
Welcome, sweetheart.

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.197
He is so cute.

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.594
He has your eyes.

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.633
Support his head.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.915
I'm not sure how.

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.229
- Like that.
- Like that?

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.150
I can't see the baby's face.

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:14.670
There we are.

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:17.070
How about I take one
of you and baby?

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.149
The camera's complicated.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.837
You won't starve to death.

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:25.116
Mom came by yesterday with Solal.

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.838
She already came?

01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:34.231
Tasty. What else is there?
Chocolate, coffee, lemon?

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:35.875
Lemon pie.

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:38.714
- No, lemon macaroons.
- They're lemon pie.

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:41.792
- The flavor's lemon pie?
- Lemon meringue pie.

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.917
- Lemon meringue?
- That's right.

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:49.950
You're right.
Tastes of lemon inside.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:52.756
And a hint of meringue outside.

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.109
The whole point...

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:55.829
of macaroons.

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:58.989
- How's the mommy feeling?
- Okay.

01:04:59.160 --> 01:04:59.990
He has a name?

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:01.275
- Yes.
- Not yet.

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:04.712
- He has a name.
- We haven't decided.

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:06.837
We chose Simbad.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.389
I need to think it over.
Can we tell you later?

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.397
- I'll come back.
- Thank you.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.430
See you later.

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.915
Didn't we agree yesterday on Simbad?

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:17.196
Simbad's the sailor, Simbad's...

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:19.597
lt's mythology, it's...

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:21.598
It's travel. Simbad's great.

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.830
Eliot sounds like
a dumbass intellectual.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.399
You like Simbad, dad?

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.116
No.

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.628
That's not a name.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:31.110
And Marie-Antoinette is? Right?

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:33.958
Simbad's great.

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:36.349
Simbad then?

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:55.354
What's the plan?

01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:00.117
There's a superb boat that picks you up
at the dock down there, if you call them.

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:02.555
I found a merry, muscular sailor

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:04.233
with bulging biceps for you.

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:05.310
You'll come with?

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:07.636
No. Today, we're going to see Agnes.

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:11.756
We're going to introduce Simbad
to Agnes today.

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.638
"We're going"? She's not coming?

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.870
Don't worry,
l'll drive down, meet her...

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:17.832
- And you...
- I'll come with you.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.958
I'm not going to take my car
to meet up with you.

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:23.429
Stop. Give it a rest.

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:26.036
Enough.

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:35.199
Just one more.

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:37.035
There you go.

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:38.594
It's over.

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:48.630
Okay?

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:50.869
Check him out.

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:52.830
How are you?

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:54.838
Hey, beautiful beloved.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:56.755
Well then?

01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:59.353
- Isn't he cute!
- See that?

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:00.994
Who's the lady?

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:02.915
Is it Auntie?

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:04.869
Auntie Agnes?

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:06.553
You're looking at me?

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:10.754
- He's so fragile, be careful.
- Of course.

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:13.751
Hold still, there you go.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:17.235
With his godmother. He'll love it later.

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:30.198
You're beautiful, aren't you?

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.029
He wants a feed.

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:32.877
You think?

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:35.874
- I don't think, I know.
- It's been a while.

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.540
He feeds every 3 hours.

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:40.192
You'll love your godmother?

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:43.640
Come on, you want to see Mommy.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.233
Don't you want to see Mommy?

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:47.152
He was happy with Auntie, too.

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:48.753
Let's give you some food.

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:49.796
Dessert?

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.712
What do you guys want? Clafoutis?

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:52.915
No dessert for me.

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:54.911
Raspberry clafoutis. You love it.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.513
I'm going to the bathroom.

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:06.714
She's happy now.

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:08.914
Thank you, my love.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:13.996
Say, where she's staying,
she's bored, I can tell.

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:15.991
Can she move in with us a while?

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.519
Marguerite Duras!

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:52.948
I love you.

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:31.756
We saw you!

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:33.273
That is so fine!

01:09:34.399 --> 01:09:36.118
Beautiful jellabah.

01:09:36.279 --> 01:09:39.352
But bad news.
We're not going out. Get your pajamas.

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:41.309
You can go out.

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:43.551
We'll have a quiet night in.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.558
Tell us another one!

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:48.279
- Nobody believes you.
- You can't go out alone?

01:09:48.439 --> 01:09:51.352
Classy, Georgio!
Staying in with wife and baby.

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:52.515
Great guy!

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.154
He is so young.

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.275
Respect.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:58.591
It's alien to you.
Marriage, a family, you've no idea.

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:01.033
Tonight, I'm grounded.

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:05.519
I'm staying home.

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:08.830
Unless...

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:09.990
Unless

01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:12.556
my love is kind enough

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.392
to set me free.

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:16.914
Like a bird of paradise.

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.590
To flutter off with his friends.

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:24.390
It's up to you, I'm not your mother.

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:25.835
There we go!

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:30.229
To Tony!

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:31.753
To my long-lost freedom!

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:36.676
Thanks, Tony.

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.754
Return to the space center.

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:53.430
ls macaroni okay with you?

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:55.711
Whatever. I'm not staying for dinner.

01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:57.438
l have a business meeting.

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:04.000
Tonight,
the day we get back from vacation?

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:05.836
Yes.

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:09.359
You're not sleeping here?

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.189
No.

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:14.433
I don't want to wake you
if I get in late.

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:22.077
I'll drop Simbad off at 9
on the way to the gynecologist's.

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:25.516
No, at 9, I'm signing off
on the sale of a building.

01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:27.035
So?

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:31.391
So, next time, tell me earlier.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.228
My love, you okay?

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:00.916
Who's she?

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:04.429
I don't know.

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:07.873
Are you nuts!

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.832
I told you, I don't know her.

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:12.992
I swear I don't remember.

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:16.593
Okay, look, here's your son.

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:19.238
- Wipes, diapers.
- I swear!

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:20.635
Everything you need.

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.438
I don't know who she is.

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:25.715
I didn't cheat.

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:29.069
I did not cheat on you.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.992
No, I know, I was with a girl in bed.

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:35.908
But nothing happened.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:37.834
l was drugged up.

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:44.516
- Since when have you...
- Always.

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.951
I've always got strung out.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:49.430
And then...

01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:51.315
| get over it.

01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:57.793
And back on the attack.

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.318
Why didn't you ever say?

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:03.509
Because for me,

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:05.995
the husband and father is supposed...

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.235
not to falter.

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:11.073
He holds things together.

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:14.429
He stays strong in all circumstances.

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:20.590
He's not the guy who trembles
or shits himself, see?

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:24.831
I wanted you to see me that way.

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:29.431
| always thought
those moments belonged only to me

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:31.392
and concerned only me.

01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:33.156
Those moments

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:35.550
were when I could behave like a shit.

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:37.828
Because deep down...

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:42.871
| feel that's what I am.

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.712
I don't know you, in fact.

01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:58.912
We don't know each other.

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:07.835
Forgive me.

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:11.634
Please.

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:14.153
You move back in here.

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:16.559
Or else we divorce.

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:20.593
I can't go on like this.

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:24.709
Okay.

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:30.590
But before that, I need therapy.

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:34.197
l have to get rid of this.

01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:37.393
Then I'll come back.

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:45.559
Know what we'll do?

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:49.110
We'll have a party to celebrate.

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:52.397
We'll go away for a weekend
and invite all our buddies.

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:06.552
Have you ever spoken
to couples who go way back?

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:08.438
How come they're still together?

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:11.115
They haven't got over cheating?

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:14.078
They haven't got over doubts and drugs?

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:16.629
They've got over everything together.

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.518
Now, couples split up like that.

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:20.915
First sign of trouble, let's split up.

01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:23.355
A kid, let's split up.
Let's have another.

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.437
We'll split up again anyway.

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:27.790
To split up, you have to be together.

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:29.518
You guys aren't together.

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:31.872
We're together separately.

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:33.359
- Right.
- I love him.

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:34.754
Leaving his wife sobbing...

01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:37.354
You judge from the outside.
What do you know?

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:38.879
- I don't.
- You do.

01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:43.235
You've never liked him.
You've condemned him from the start.

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:45.152
You never give him a chance.

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:47.117
| always said he's wrong for you.

01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:48.993
Quite honestly,

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:50.798
putting your son through this...

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:55.392
Through what?
I want my son to live with both parents!

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:56.953
- You can't do it.
- I can.

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.076
You'll see.

01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:01.117
You'll see that I can do it.

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:02.599
Keep going like this

01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:05.593
and, one day,
you'll have an accident. For real.

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:10.559
A brother has to say
what he thinks of a situation.

01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:12.676
It's my responsibility. What's that?

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:13.955
My tranquilizers.

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:18.071
He's the dopehead
and you're on a cure? Of tranquilizers?

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.717
Look, this is how you eat it.

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.359
You're jealous?

01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:35.039
- No.
- As if!

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:38.073
I saw those jealous eyes.

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:43.269
You think I'd steal your man?

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:44.919
I don't steal other people's men.

01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:46.911
Look at me, I'm talking to you.

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:51.191
I don't steal other people's men.

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:54.591
- Fine.
- l have the man I love!

01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:57.672
Georgio, the man you love!

01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:58.397
My love!

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:01.950
Come on!

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:03.315
Dammit!

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:05.316
Calm down.

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:06.919
Where's my glass?

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:17.431
Calm down.

01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:20.950
- l have an announcement to make.
- Without the glass.

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:23.630
Listen to me!

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:26.229
Sit down, you!

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:31.393
You know what the party's for tonight?

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.594
I'll leave it to Georgio to tell you.

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:37.428
Stand up!

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:43.358
Go on, tell them.

01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:49.790
I'll tell you what the party's for.

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:53.910
Georgio is going to start therapy.

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:04.670
Because he has addictions.

01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:06.751
Because he's hooked on alcohol.

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:11.152
Because he runs away,
abandoning his wife and child.

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:14.951
Because he's sick.

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:17.111
And because he hurts people.

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:19.635
Tony, stop.

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:21.995
Tony, stop?

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:23.832
No, Tony won't stop.

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:26.960
Tony is sick of it!

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.070
Sick, sick, sick of it!

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:45.869
Drink some water.

01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:47.516
Come on.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:50.715
Come on, I said.

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:54.550
I'm not good enough
to be with your friends?

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:56.199
All your friends

01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:58.237
from beauty and fashion!

01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.355
From youth!

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:00.949
From drugs!

01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:06.194
You have to be on drugs
to be accepted into your circle.

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:07.749
It's true!

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:32.794
Nine euros.

01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:35.191
- Your two boxes.
- Thanks.

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:36.679
- Hi, Joseph.
- Evening, Tony.

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:37.670
- Okay?
- And you?

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:38.989
Cute little flower!

01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:41.594
To brighten the place up for Christmas.

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:43.352
One Prozac, one Xanax.

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:44.959
Okay, one of each.

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:46.633
- All good?
-Great.

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:47.790
Right.

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:49.555
Coming right up.

01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:55.831
Christian.

01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:57.869
Law school.

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:01.597
- How are you?
- Good, and you?

01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:04.115
You've gone bald. A total train wreck.

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:05.713
Taken a real hit.

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:07.636
There you go.

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:09.119
- On your tab?
- On my tab.

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:10.190
As usual.

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:12.316
Anyway, I'll be back in the week.

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:13.669
You've had a baby?

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:14.909
Wonderful.

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:16.391
Simbad...

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:18.397
Christian, an old friend.

01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:22.029
- What's your husband do?
- My husband's...

01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:24.799
Did I take my pills?

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:26.188
Yes, I put them there.

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:29.198
I saw you put them in your bag.

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:30.355
There they are.

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:32.950
It was cool running into you.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.115
Big kiss.

01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:36.709
Be strong.

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:47.634
| forgot my little Simbad!

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:51.758
How could I forget you?

01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:57.832
Dad, was he a shaken baby?

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.958
Shaken babies are babies
that are shaken very hard

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:03.111
by frazzled mothers who sob and howl,

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:05.874
Shut up! Will you shut up!

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.349
That's a shaken baby.

01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:10.955
- It's underestimated.
- And after-effects?

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:12.678
- After what?
- After-effects.

01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:13.795
Look at Babeth.

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:18.634
She could be an example.

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:21.075
That's Georgio.

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:22.639
Sweetie, it's Daddy.

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:25.314
- He doesn't care about Daddy.
- He's across the world.

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:28.919
Come on, baby.

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:31.191
- Look who it is.
- Who’s this?

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:32.349
Hi, Daddy.

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:35.757
Look at you/ Aren't you gorgeous!

01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:36.995
Where are you?

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:37.956
Australia.

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:39.519
Guess who can stand up.

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.072
Show Daddy you can stand up.

01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:48.591
You ’re fabulous!

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:52.272
/ called to say Merry Christmas.

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:55.355
You okay?

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:01.155
I've got to go, we're going to eat.

01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:02.150
Miss you both.

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:05.834
Ciao, Simbad

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:07.675
Ciao, buddy.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.592
My love! My baby./

01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:12.394
You see your father?

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:14.716
What's he doing? Island-hopping?

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:16.715
No, he's...

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:18.154
He's had a breakdown.

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.833
He's in a bad way.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.319
It's understandable.

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:22.953
He lost his father.

01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:26.678
Obviously, he needs to be away
from his wife and son,

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:28.990
on a boat in Australia to think.

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:31.669
That raises the bar for when you die.

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:33.519
Where will we go?

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:36.240
Japan maybe?
The Great Wall of China?

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:37.436
Slow down.

01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:38.709
Look at him.

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:41.030
He was nice and calm.

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:43.031
After your Skype, he's agitated.

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.758
Sure, he saw his daddy.

01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:48.993
No, he saw something on a computer,
not his father.

01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:51.674
Young babies don't understand mirrors.

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:54.149
They can't understand Skype
because it's flat.

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:55.316
Okay, Lila.

01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:57.750
New subject maybe, we're done with that.

01:22:58.200 --> 01:22:59.110
Excuse me.

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:05.877
| feel like a parrot,
endlessly repeating itself.

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.792
Except she never wakes up.

01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:10.079
The day he remarries,

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:12.993
she'll say
it's to understand his first marriage.

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:15.116
Apparently, love's like that.

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:35.995
Shit!

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:42.309
Can you hear me?

01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:43.755
Okay, sir.

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:45.194
She's breathing.

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:53.550
- She ever attempt suicide?
- Never.

01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:55.438
- We have a pulse.
- She took that.

01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:57.159
Okay, I'll keep the tube.

01:23:57.320 --> 01:23:58.389
Look at me.

01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:00.878
You took the whole tube?

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:02.955
Can you hear me?

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:04.712
Tell me what happened.

01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:06.154
Her husband called.

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:07.992
I'd like your sister to tell me.

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:09.070
She can't talk.

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:10.878
Tell me, I'm listening.

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:13.316
l'll pack a bag for her.

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:19.590
Solal.

01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:21.234
Yes, I'm here.

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:23.152
Get in, it'll reassure her.

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:52.068
What can I get you?

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:55.273
Sparkling water, please.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.399
Lightly sparkling.

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:00.079
You're looking better.

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:02.429
That's not hard.

01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:07.873
I want a divorce.

01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:18.195
You love me?

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:19.316
Yes.

01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:21.079
So, that's settled.

01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:22.195
The check!

01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:23.588
It's not settled.

01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:25.712
The problem isn't you or me.

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:27.598
The problem's us together.

01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:29.838
Isn't that a Phil Collins song?

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:34.996
What are you after? Tell me.

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.998
Live apart and never see you.

01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:39.396
You'll be able to do whatever, whenever.

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:42.114
Nobody will scream at you,
there'll be no tears...

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:45.233
You hit on me, remember.

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:47.789
- I hit on you?
- You saw me with my crew.

01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:49.439
Out drinking. You saw it.

01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:52.519
You sized me up, right? You're a lawyer.

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:55.879
I wasn't some guy you met in a library.

01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:00.514
You leave people for the same reasons...

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:04.793
- Exactly.
- The same thing that first attracted you.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.228
Precisely the same reasons.

01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:07.150
Okay.

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:11.029
So the next guy will attract you
for a reason, then you'll leave him.

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:14.078
- When do you build something?
- We're building nothing.

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:16.595
- Really?
- We destroy each other, that's all.

01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:20.589
Not you.

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:23.191
- Not me?
- You're indestructible.

01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:24.315
In any case...

01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:26.198
Modesty, ever heard of it?

01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:31.633
When you love someone,

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:33.199
it hurts, it's not easy.

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:36.238
- You don't hurt much.
- Don't tell me what I feel.

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:37.799
You're a pain in the ass.

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:38.870
What the hell!

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:41.634
I've got to burst into tears
all the time?

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:44.791
How do you know what I feel?

01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:46.393
You want me to...

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:49.034
- What do you want?
- You fought for us?

01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:50.030
- Yes.
- No.

01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:51.315
- Yes.
- Not one second.

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:56.995
What's "fighting" mean?
Screaming, bleeding...

01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:58.832
That's not how I fight.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.877
| find a way to stop you leaving.

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:03.758
That's how I fight for us.

01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:08.430
Why must I be
what you want me to be?

01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:11.918
You came over to me

01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:14.150
precisely because I am what I am.

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:21.151
Why not accept what you have?

01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:23.792
I can't go on like this.

01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:27.072
Monday, we're together.
Wednesday, we're not.

01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:29.071
Thursday, you'll move back in.

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:30.639
Friday, no you won't.

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:33.837
Next Monday, you cheat on me.
Next Wednesday, you love me.

01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:35.388
I can't take any more.

01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:37.068
I prefer...

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:41.349
I prefer this

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:42.237
to that...

01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:44.750
That's called an electrocardiogram.

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:46.558
Like that, you're alive.

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:48.073
Like that, you're dead.

01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:51.832
I prefer not to be in love,
and not get hurt.

01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:57.434
That's what you want?

01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:59.198
Yes, that's what I want.

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:10.352
What about our boy?

01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:14.233
Until the divorce settlement,
alternate weekends.

01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:18.039
The nanny brings him over,
so we don't meet.

01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:36.676
No.

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:39.594
What do you want?

01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:40.556
No divorce.

01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:42.153
- Not an option.
- Okay.

01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:44.550
If we divorce,
I keep him, you visit...

01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:46.517
That's not going to happen.

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:49.035
We'll both hire lawyers and the judge...

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:50.633
I hire you as my lawyer.

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:52.599
No, I won't do it.

01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:55.116
Sorry, I want you to be my lawyer.

01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:57.874
- Not possible.
- It's what will happen.

01:28:58.080 --> 01:28:59.433
I'll pay you a fortune.

01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:01.432
I don't want your money.

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:02.959
It's Agnes's money.

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.030
Take it.

01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:15.195
What is this!

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:18.079
We'll have to explain to Simbad.

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:22.556
Let him be. He's suffered enough.

01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:26.076
For you, letting people be
means not explaining things.

01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:29.193
- You do talk crap.
- We have to tell him.

01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:30.793
- Shut up!
- We tell him.

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:32.393
At 1 year old! Tell him what?

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:34.556
What the hell! He can't talk!

01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:36.711
He understands, he senses it.

01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:40.278
We tell him.
We sit down and talk to him.

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:43.159
We tell him it's over
and we're separating.

01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:44.639
You live with Daddy.

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:47.314
Then with Mommy.
Your parents have split up.

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:50.637
Make an appointment,
see when he can fit us in.

01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:51.916
So?

01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:54.271
I say we tell him. How's best?

01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:58.277
- How do we do it?
- Yes, how?

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:00.869
Like this.

01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:02.189
Stop it, Georgio.

01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:11.875
Listen up.

01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:14.110
I'll see my son as much as you.

01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:15.799
Or I'll start talking.

01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:16.995
Let go of me!

01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:29.994
If you think your lawyer tricks
will keep my son from me,

01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:31.639
you're kidding yourself.

01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:34.788
Don't forget
the pills you popped pregnant,

01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:37.235
and constantly freaking out
in front of him.

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:38.150
Remember?

01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:40.370
I've got witnesses.

01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:42.192
And you'll lose custody.

01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:44.590
Use your head for once in your life.

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:47.309
Got me?

01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:14.999
Take your weight.

01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:18.988
Easy does it.

01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:20.719
Very slowly.

01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:24.196
There you go, very good.

01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:25.828
That's great.

01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:33.269
Give me five.

01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:48.513
My beauty!

01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:50.796
I missed you so much!

01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:53.911
Let me take a look at you.

01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:36.431
You decide what I juggle.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.911
Kiwi, orange, spoon, you choose.

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:41.548
Kiwi, orange and open yogurt.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.228
An open yogurt?

01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:46.069
Sneaky!

01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:47.514
Here we go.

01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:49.668
Move back.

01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:54.075
Hold on, we're taking cover.

01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:36.748
See? I can still make you laugh.

01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:41.798
Sex!

01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:53.792
Now we're divorced,
I can propose to you again.

01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:55.793
Yes, you can.

01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:58.670
I can't guarantee the answer.

01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:04.029
Hold on...

01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:07.035
l was looking for my teddy bear, dammit.

01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:08.914
She's such a pain!

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:18.237
You've had dental work?

01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:19.674
Had them whitened?

01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:20.909
Just go!

01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:23.719
Your bitch act! So annoying!

01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:26.953
Enough, get up.

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.111
Listen! The little boy!

01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:30.909
Hide in there.

01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:34.595
He's my son.
He can see his dad in bed with his mom.

01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:37.991
We're separated and you're dating.
lt'll confuse him.

01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:39.554
Mommy!

01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:41.836
On one condition. Tonight we fuck.

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:44.238
Or I stay here.
Here he comes!

01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:45.874
- Tonight we fuck?
- Yes.

01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:47.189
Touch my balls.

01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:49.670
I'm going.

01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:57.395
Hippopo!

01:34:57.800 --> 01:34:59.438
Bring Hippo. You slept well?

01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:02.591
Morning, my love!

01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:04.439
Morning, sweetheart.

01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:05.709
I'm hungry.

01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:07.154
I'll go get breakfast.

01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:12.996
She's reunited with her true love.

01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:16.953
Dropped it.

01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:18.874
Give it to Hippo.

01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:22.110
Who's that?

01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:27.392
Look who's popped out! Da...

01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:28.356
Daddy!

01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:33.599
Come here, you!

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.228
You've changed.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.149
You're serene.

01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:46.756
I'm back to how I was before.

01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:48.155
Before what?

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.149
Before I met you.

01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:53.670
- Have you changed?
- I'm off everything.

01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:57.556
One coffee's exceptional.
For me now, it's a psychotropic.

01:35:57.720 --> 01:35:59.870
- Stop.
- | drink camomile, don't smoke.

01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:01.109
I'm on nothing.

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:03.510
Damn.

01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:06.589
What about Agnes?

01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:09.396
I'm done with her. She's on her own.

01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:11.833
As my father used to say,

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.594
abandon those who abandon themselves.

01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:20.595
I didn't get what happened last night.

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:24.591
Why all of a sudden, yes?
Now all of a sudden, no?

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:26.711
That was last night.
Today's real life.

01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:28.279
Last night wasn't real life?

01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:29.873
No, it was a parenthesis.

01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:33.355
It wasn't a parenthesis.

01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:35.113
The rest is a parenthesis.

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:40.718
Finished your coffee?

01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:43.675
Drink up and...

01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:47.196
You changed your batteries recently.

01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:51.519
Come on, stop.

01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:53.113
We can go away together.

01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:56.909
We can go eat mussels in Deauville.

01:36:58.280 --> 01:36:59.998
No, because Simbad...

01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:01.874
Waffles in Brussels.

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:05.191
Couscous in Marrakesh.

01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:06.954
They do lemon tagine?

01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:10.279
Where's my phone?
I'll call Mohamed at La Mamounia.

01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:13.796
They set sail for Marrakesh

01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:17.592
to eat couscous with their son, Simbad!

01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:20.038
All aboard for adventure!

01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:25.679
Who wants to start today?

01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:26.750
Me first!

01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:30.275
Go on.

01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:33.430
Today, I'd like to ask forgiveness.

01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:35.989
Ask forgiveness?

01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:37.835
What for?

01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:45.276
For the pain I may have caused Tony.

01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:48.114
And you, Simbad.

01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:00.033
| ask your forgiveness.

01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:03.355
Do you forgive me?

01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:08.079
You heard him, Simbad?

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.433
Do you forgive him now?

01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:14.677
- It's not me.
- What's not you?

01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:17.599
lt's Mommy.

01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:27.795
There!

01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:38.393
What about you, Tony?

01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:41.239
How do you take that?

01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:47.351
I hope he means it.

01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:50.672
Of course I mean it.

01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:56.109
lt's giving me...

01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:59.115
It's like pins and needles, don't worry.

01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:01.588
That's too strong.

01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:03.557
- Try to relax first.
- Me?

01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:06.956
No stress. Life's cool.

01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:11.110
Go with what feels right.
Stronger up top, less below.

01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:12.913
- How about 15?
- Sure.

01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:14.911
And another thing...

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.069
Check that out!

01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:18.798
It's cool, I love it.

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:20.309
Kissy kiss!

01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:23.828
Tony, look.

01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:26.994
Look at your thighs,
compared to mine.

01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:29.514
Here we go.

01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:31.272
That's an obese muscle.

01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:33.597
You're making it do that.

01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:34.909
No, I'm not.

01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:40.233
The noise it makes.

01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:56.557
- You're kidding me.
- Like it?

01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:59.320
You didn't think
I'd forget my son's 7th birthday?

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.274
You're happy to see me?

01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:05.518
- You're happy to see me?
- Yes.

01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:07.113
She's happy to see me!

01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:10.919
You want me to ride him?

01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:12.993
Excuse me, watch out.

01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:14.834
He'll collapse under you.

01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:19.278
Welcome to my estate...

01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:34.109
Put your arm down.

01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:35.310
Take that!

01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:36.555
Get him back!

01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:41.115
Help!

01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:52.237
Can't you take off your jacket?

01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:54.392
People will think you're a waiter.

01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:55.994
You look like a waiter.

01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:57.673
That's lucky because...

01:40:57.840 --> 01:40:58.795
I'm a waiter.

01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:03.998
We have Pouilly de Chantemarais.

01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:06.311
1978, if you'd care to taste.

01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:08.598
Very attractive color.

01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:10.034
Sir, of course.

01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:12.834
May |?

01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:15.359
- A drop.
- lt's alcohol.

01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:17.391
Won't do sir any harm.

01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:19.035
Sir

01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:21.397
is celebrating his 77th year.

01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:24.354
Just wet your lips.

01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:26.149
Drink up.

01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:33.715
Today's special offer is
Monbouillet St. Sylvestre Roche Foucault.

01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:35.916
We're multitasking here.

01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:37.593
Sorry, excuse me.

01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:38.630
That's great.

01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:40.592
- Which table?
- There but...

01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:41.670
I've got it.

01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:45.311
l'll guess. Gut instinct.

01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:50.552
Clear table 10, please.

01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:52.908
Table 8, please.

01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:54.149
Hurry.

01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:05.234
Watch out!

01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:06.950
Excuse me.

01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:12.919
Sorry, I'm a beginner.

01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:24.678
It's the birthday of sir...

01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:25.795
Simbad!

01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:39.509
For me?

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:41.592
Yes, for you.

01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:43.159
Put it to good use.

01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:51.279
Not the one you wanted?

01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:52.676
It is?

01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:55.150
Let me see.

01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:56.629
Look!

01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:09.597
- What?
- Let me say thank you.

01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:10.954
Please do.

01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:21.389
Good Lord, the child is ill.

01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:22.796
He's infected.

01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:24.552
Time for bed.

01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:26.593
Come on, let's go.

01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:29.638
Can I sleep with Dad?

01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:32.715
Sure, why not?

01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:35.110
- All his stuff's in...
- It's not far.

01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:38.551
Don't get mad. I won't steal him.

01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:40.153
I'm not mad at you.

01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:42.715
I can see
why it would make you happy.

01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:43.949
It's not my choice.

01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:46.680
The child expressed the wish...

01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:47.750
You see?

01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:51.153
Your toothbrush is in the bag there.

01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:55.955
Not a word for me?

01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:57.235
Goodnight, Mom.

01:43:58.160 --> 01:43:59.309
Goodnight, my love.

01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:01.798
Let's get our pajamas on.

01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:03.871
Let's take our vest off fast,

01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:07.072
then let's take off our shirt.
Hurry, hurry.

01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:24.830
Open up.

01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:29.034
What do you want?

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:30.556
To bone you.

01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:36.915
Open up.

01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:39.035
Please.

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:41.273
- Leave me alone.
- It's dangerous.

01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:42.793
In case of fire or flood,

01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:44.075
you'll be trapped.

01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:45.878
Don't worry about me.

01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:51.194
You bust the...

01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:52.953
I wanna see my chick.

01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:54.594
You bust the lock?

01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:57.112
- That's not all I'll bust.
- Stop.

01:44:57.280 --> 01:44:58.110
I want to talk.

01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:00.556
I think I caught something. Look!

01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:03.109
- I don't want to look.
- Touch it!

01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:04.429
- I swear.
- I won't.

01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:07.158
- No violence.
- Get out!

01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:11.231
- Get out of my room.
- Okay, your room, my room...

01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:14.278
- You're bored, that's all.
- No, missing you.

01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:16.910
Go to bed. I want to read.

01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:18.274
I do what I want.

01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:23.628
You're cute, you know.

01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:25.509
Straight up.

01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:28.828
Dumb you're a dummy.

01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:37.234
That's not pata negra. lt's shit.

01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:39.512
- Real pata negra...
- It isn't.

01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:42.035
- Real pata negra...
- It's not as good.

01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:43.391
What?

01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:45.272
It's not as good as pata negra.

01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:46.755
It's nothing like it.

01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:50.356
This is crappy serrano
cured maybe three months.

01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:54.236
- Why do they call it pata negra?
- Pata negra, jabugo, bellota...

01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:56.436
- They chose the wrong guy.
- Exactly.

01:45:56.760 --> 01:45:59.354
Bellota, you know,
been there, done that.

01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:00.595
Duckie!

01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:02.632
That's not bellota.

01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:05.709
- It's from Auvergne.
- Auvergne?

01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:08.190
Why call it pata negra then?

01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:12.878
They get a lot of Germans and Russians,
so they rip those guys off.

01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:15.711
They think we're tourists.

01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:18.410
There is something Polish about you.

01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:21.549
Sorry.

01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:25.354
In a restaurant.

01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:28.033
Yeah, go ahead.

01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:33.034
You're kidding?

01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:38.158
Does Bouvet know?

01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:42.191
Hold on, I'll be right there.

01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:44.078
I'll call him from the office.

01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:46.834
I'm on my way.
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:48.792
Okay, see you in a second.

01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:51.036
That's nuts! See you.

01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:55.555
Bricourt, ring a bell?
The CEO accused of killing his wife,

01:46:55.720 --> 01:46:56.835
all over the news.

01:46:58.400 --> 01:46:59.833
He chose me to defend him.

01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:02.589
- Just imagine!
- Wonderful.

01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:05.228
A huge trial in the high court.

01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:07.356
A juicy case, as they say.

01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:09.916
Right?

01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:12.915
- Right.
- That's good. Great.

01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:17.351
- You're not happy for me?
- Super happy.

01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:20.154
You're defending a motherfucker.
Fantastic.

01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:26.591
I've got to get back.

01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:30.992
For our firm, it's huge.
You have no idea.

01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:33.151
We've ordered. Let's eat first.

01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:35.872
We can have dinner anytime,

01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:38.429
but this could be once in a lifetime.

01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:41.319
Come along if you want.

01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:45.633
Don't I get a "Have fun"?

01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:46.869
Have fun.

01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:11.749
Tony!

01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:16.038
- What?
- Are you coming down?

01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:17.997
I'll be there in a minute.

01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:19.434
We're waiting here.

01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:21.915
- Where you going?
- Shopping in Hossegor.

01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:23.958
- Why?
- I've got a date.

01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:25.229
Jibril!

01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:32.070
What's up?

01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:34.037
More noise than back in the hood.

01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:36.270
Drive us to Hossegor to go shopping.

01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:39.159
- Were you sleeping?
- Save it for later!

01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:43.793
- This isn't Boyz n the Hood!
- Go back to bed!

01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:45.428
It's Saturday!

01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:48.718
l was dreaming of naked chicks.
You ruined it.

01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:51.189
It was a dream. Wake up now!

01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:21.077
Greg! Take your photo!

01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:28.589
Cut it out!

01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:31.713
- Jibril...
- Damn!

01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:35.830
Excuse me, can I buy you a coffee?

01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:37.275
Special offer.

01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:40.309
- Can I buy you a soda?
- Snooty ass.

01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:42.238
I got an Audi.

01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:44.119
You're hot, shortie!

01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:47.829
Tony, why do you hang with us?

01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:52.676
We're not the same age,

01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:54.910
not the same social background.

01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:56.832
You're not as smart as us.

01:49:57.040 --> 01:49:58.553
And you hang out with us.

01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:02.271
- Seriously, how come?
- You got an ulterior motive?

01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:05.716
I don't need one.
I like you guys. You're fun.

01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:07.839
You're real clowns.

01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:09.314
Who's your favorite?

01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:10.919
Out of all of you?

01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:12.718
Not counting Arabs and Blacks.

01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:22.109
What brings you here?

01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:25.154
- We don't have an appointment.
- Sure we do.

01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:29.835
Just a second.

01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:42.590
I'm listening.

01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:44.034
"I'm listening"?

01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:45.879
That's you listening?

01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:50.034
We're not in court. Chill out, counsel!
You talk to me as if...

01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:51.918
So tell me what you want.

01:50:55.280 --> 01:50:57.589
Am I allowed to say I miss you?

01:50:58.840 --> 01:50:59.636
What?

01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:00.790
It's allowed?

01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:02.632
- Or banned?
- So?

01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:04.592
You miss me,
so I come running?

01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:07.320
I'm just saying I miss you.
Maybe I messed up.

01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:10.956
Maybe I see you dropping out of my life
and it drives me nuts.

01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:13.509
It's dumb you only realize that now.

01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:18.348
You know, in a few days, it's 10 years.

01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:22.671
Reason enough to have dinner.

01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:25.719
You want to see me
because it does you good.

01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:28.678
So you just drop by
but what about me?

01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:31.593
Fact is, I want to see you
because I love you.

01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:34.115
And you love me, so you avoid me.

01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:36.191
- Understand the difference?
- So?

01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:37.998
What can you give me now

01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:40.230
that you couldn't ten years ago?

01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:41.515
It'll be different?

01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:42.749
- Better.
- Better?

01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:44.751
You see the daylight,

01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:46.990
you love reading under a tree?

01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:50.277
You don't need 30 hangers-on
to be happy?

01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:53.989
- It's about wanting to read books.
- About wanting the same things.

01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:56.720
Great!
We could read under the same tree.

01:51:57.360 --> 01:51:58.509
The same book.

01:51:58.680 --> 01:51:59.749
Alright...

01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:02.639
We buy two copies, so we can discuss it.

01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:05.998
It's been ten years
of you threatening me,

01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:08.674
and, next day,
proposing to me again.

01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:12.196
The day after, you promise
to square up your tax situation.

01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:15.591
Years later, nothing's changed.
You run with the same crowd.

01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:17.557
It's just hot air.

01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:21.640
I want to be happy. Let me be happy.

01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:24.155
If you love me,
you'd want me to be happy.

01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:25.833
Let me be happy!

01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:29.035
I can't make you happy?

01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:31.156
You know
you can't make me happy!

01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:33.675
Me neither.
I didn't make you happy.

01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:36.195
Let's stop this charade!

01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:42.155
You've got a man. Is that it?

01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:45.229
Is that it?

01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:48.194
Yes, I've got a man.

01:52:57.280 --> 01:52:58.508
You know that...

01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:02.437
You leave Simbad out of that.

01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:04.798
I don't want this man...

01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:08.876
I don't want this man living with Simbad.
You know that?

01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:11.156
You know
you have no say in my life?

01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:12.799
I don't care who you bang,

01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:15.872
but my son
is not to have any relationship

01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:17.871
with a man I've never met.

01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:20.190
Hold on, you're out of your mind.

01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:21.793
I'm not out of my mind.

01:53:23.560 --> 01:53:24.754
I don't know this guy.

01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:27.036
My son does not
go anywhere near him.

01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:28.599
You hear me, Tony?

01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:32.753
If your man
goes anywhere near my son, honey,

01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:36.556
I'll take care of your shit
and not in a lawyer's office.

01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:38.598
You can start right now.

01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:41.917
My son has met my man
and they get on just fine.

01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:56.958
Defying me, are you?

01:53:57.680 --> 01:53:59.989
You decide right and wrong?

01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:02.230
You decide for him?

01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:04.550
What did you do to me for years?

01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:06.278
I never laid a hand on you.

01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:09.159
You want a medal
for not laying a hand on me?

01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:11.515
What about the psychological abuse?

01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:14.035
You don't think it hurts
more than a punch?

01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:15.315
Tony, stop it!

01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:17.313
He's leaving, cut it out.

01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:19.034
Leave, Georgio.

01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:21.950
Stay there.

01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:25.430
Calm down.

01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:26.675
Sit down.

01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:17.199
I'll miss you guys.

01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:20.754
Stay in touch.

01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:28.799
Look after your knee.

01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:35.389
Take care.

01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:40.391
- Love ya, wallah.
- Same here.

01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:41.670
See you, guys.

01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:45.034
Drive safely.

01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:53.798
Go ahead, take a seat.

01:55:56.680 --> 01:55:57.795
How's your leg?

01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:02.556
I'm still limping,
but I'm happy to be walking again.

01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:05.759
Let's start with Simbad's drawings.

01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:07.751
They've progressed nicely over the year.

01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:10.354
- These are the older ones?
- That's right.

01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:13.839
The progression
from the start of the year is...

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:15.274
We'd chosen a theme.

01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:17.192
The theme was the sea.

01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:20.353
A slight problem with...

01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:23.028
Traffic.

01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:28.069
Even on a motorcycle,
it's tricky, the bike lanes...

01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:29.798
Anyway, I'm sorry.

01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:31.356
Hello.

01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:33.109
How are you?

01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:34.349
Hello!

01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:38.028
We started with his drawings.
Very interesting.

01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:42.189
We were discussing them
with the doctor here.

01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:44.353
He did these? All of them?

01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:46.357
Yes, he did. They're Simbad's.

01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:48.996
They're learning to tell the time?

01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:52.514
Have learned.
Ask him the time, you'll see.

01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:53.954
He never talks about it.

01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:56.628
Sure he does.
I ask him and he tells me.

01:56:56.880 --> 01:56:59.269
He even reads the time on my watch.

01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:10.319
He applies himself well.

01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:11.236
Really?

01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:13.512
- Seriously?
- Very well.

01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:16.114
Remarkably so for a boy.

01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:17.235
For a boy?

01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:20.518
Generally, boys take more time

01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:22.194
to write neatly.

01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:24.391
Girls tend to be

01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:27.280
better at applying themselves
to handwriting.

01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:30.159
He gets it from his mother.
The elegance...

01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:32.598
is perhaps from my father.

01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:35.357
My father was very elegant.

01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:26.149
I'm delighted you both could make it

01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:28.880
because we have very good news for you.

01:58:29.160 --> 01:58:31.879
He will be promoted to the next grade.

01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:33.753
So we're very happy,

01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:37.037
after the tricky start he made.

01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:39.192
Congratulations to you both.

01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:41.590
You helped him to progress.

01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:43.990
You can be proud of him.

01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:46.149
Thank you.

01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:50.236
- Is that all for today?
- I think so.

01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:51.276
Okay.

01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:54.159
Thank you very much for your patience.

01:58:55.280 --> 01:58:56.269
Thanks again.

01:58:56.440 --> 01:58:57.429
You're welcome.

01:58:57.840 --> 01:58:58.670
Good bye.

01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:00.516
Good bye?
