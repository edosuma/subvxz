WEBVTT

00:03.004 --> 00:04.923
Shadow,
we're gonna be releasing you

00:05.090 --> 00:07.300
later this afternoon.
Your wife...

00:09.552 --> 00:11.721
...she died in the early hours
of this morning.

00:12.681 --> 00:14.557
An automobile accident.

00:15.517 --> 00:16.935
I love you, puppy.

00:17.977 --> 00:19.062
I'm a leprechaun.

00:19.896 --> 00:20.939
My lucky coin.

00:27.570 --> 00:29.447
You are pretending you cannot

00:29.614 --> 00:32.450
believe in impossible things.

00:36.037 --> 00:38.456
Give me my fucking
coin, dead wife.

00:38.623 --> 00:40.125
Ah!

00:40.291 --> 00:42.877
I was killed by a god.
Which fucking god?

00:43.044 --> 00:44.796
Wednesday. Oh!

00:45.755 --> 00:46.881
Fuck that guy.

00:48.425 --> 00:49.968
Do you know who he is?

00:51.177 --> 00:52.554
Who he really is?

00:53.221 --> 00:54.472
Shadow Moon.

00:55.140 --> 00:56.391
You're my man now.

00:57.851 --> 00:59.018
He's hustling you.

00:59.185 --> 01:00.687
He's a hustler.

01:03.064 --> 01:04.399
Hello, Shadow.

01:04.566 --> 01:06.735
- You're working for Wednesday.
- Yeah.

01:06.901 --> 01:07.944
Kill him.

01:11.573 --> 01:13.241
You are on a path...

01:13.408 --> 01:15.368
from nothing to everything.

01:17.078 --> 01:18.705
He does not know our world.

01:22.751 --> 01:23.877
I'm easing him in.

01:25.211 --> 01:27.756
What's a god?
Can we even know they exist?

01:27.922 --> 01:30.467
People believe things.
Which means they're real.

01:30.633 --> 01:34.262
So what came first, gods or the
people who believed in them?

01:34.888 --> 01:36.514
You've done well with me.

01:36.681 --> 01:38.767
Now, you owe.

01:38.933 --> 01:40.727
I'm calling it in.

01:40.894 --> 01:42.562
Mr. Wednesday.

01:45.940 --> 01:47.484
Overdue.

01:48.193 --> 01:50.487
I hear war...

01:56.951 --> 01:58.411
I am...

01:58.578 --> 02:02.040
Odin!

02:02.707 --> 02:04.375
You wanted a war...

02:04.542 --> 02:06.711
...you have one.

02:08.213 --> 02:11.132
Is this real?
Did that just happen?

02:11.508 --> 02:13.259
It's still happening?

04:19.260 --> 04:20.803
<i>Your destination
is on the right.</i>

04:20.970 --> 04:23.056
I know where I'm going!

04:41.908 --> 04:43.117
Dude.

04:43.284 --> 04:44.494
You're a mess.

04:44.661 --> 04:48.665
He could've killed... me.

04:52.210 --> 04:53.419
Show him.

05:18.987 --> 05:20.154
Challenge.

05:20.905 --> 05:22.740
Buroklammer.

05:25.910 --> 05:26.869
Mister...?

05:27.036 --> 05:28.538
World.

05:32.667 --> 05:34.919
I am Mr. World.

05:36.170 --> 05:37.755
Welcome to Black Briar.

05:38.840 --> 05:40.591
I'll destroy the old fucker.

05:40.758 --> 05:42.468
I'm going to take him out.

05:42.635 --> 05:45.596
I'm going to take them all...
out.

05:45.763 --> 05:46.806
No.

05:47.765 --> 05:50.435
We can't move
without preparation,

05:50.601 --> 05:52.645
off balance and unready.

05:54.522 --> 05:56.315
We'll marshal our forces,

05:58.067 --> 06:02.113
and eradicate his paternal stain
from the geriatric tomes

06:02.280 --> 06:04.449
of every decrepit church,
temple,

06:04.615 --> 06:06.951
and back-alley apothecary.

06:08.077 --> 06:11.039
When the time comes...

06:13.332 --> 06:16.461
...the gutters will run black
with ichorous spume,

06:16.627 --> 06:20.131
and the ossuaries
shall overflow with his dust.

06:20.965 --> 06:23.968
This is a time...

06:25.094 --> 06:26.846
for preparation.

06:27.889 --> 06:31.601
I can't sell war
without my best salesman.

06:36.397 --> 06:37.648
You...

06:39.108 --> 06:41.569
...need to find her.

06:57.668 --> 06:59.837
Find Media.

07:02.507 --> 07:03.841
Oh!

07:15.478 --> 07:16.896
Fuck!

how such a sweet old man
could have so many enemies.

09:09.425 --> 09:12.595
Oh, it's perfectly simple,
my dear. Jealousy.

09:12.762 --> 09:14.889
Pure unmitigated jealousy.

09:15.056 --> 09:16.641
They all want what I have.

09:16.807 --> 09:19.018
A good time, wherever I go.

09:19.185 --> 09:21.062
He's the original good time
that was had by all.

09:21.229 --> 09:23.648
I get to ride along with you.

09:23.814 --> 09:25.608
I must be the luckiest
girl in the world.

09:25.775 --> 09:27.610
That you are.

09:27.777 --> 09:29.862
But it's my bloody luck
you're feeding on, dead wife.

09:34.659 --> 09:36.577

♪ I'm trying to escape
the memory ♪

09:41.123 --> 09:43.000
What is the House on the Rock?

09:43.167 --> 09:47.296
A place where people
come to look, play, and wonder.

09:47.463 --> 09:48.464
Like Disney World.

09:48.839 --> 09:50.383
Dear old Walt.

09:50.549 --> 09:54.011
Built a Magic Kingdom
without any magic.

09:54.178 --> 09:56.681
Whereas in some parts
of Florida, there is real magic.

09:56.847 --> 10:01.018
Oh, remember the mermaids
of Weeki Wachee, Sweeney?

10:02.019 --> 10:04.689
Aye. Been there
and done several of them.

10:04.855 --> 10:07.024
Who knew they'd
be into that kind of thing.

10:07.191 --> 10:09.277
They're a very
passionate species.

10:13.197 --> 10:14.991
Do you believe
in mermaids now?

10:19.870 --> 10:21.497
I don't know
what I believe in yet.

10:21.664 --> 10:23.374
I guess...

10:24.959 --> 10:28.087
I dunno, I...
I guess I believe in him.

10:30.715 --> 10:32.258
I want to believe in you.

10:44.395 --> 10:46.105
<i>Sixty years ago,</i>

10:46.272 --> 10:49.191
<i>Alex Jordan began
to build a house</i>

10:49.358 --> 10:54.155
<i>on a high spot of rock
in a field he did not even own.</i>

10:56.532 --> 10:58.034
<i>And even more,</i>

10:58.200 --> 11:00.328
<i>he could not have
told you why.</i>

11:03.080 --> 11:05.916
<i>And people came
to see him build it.</i>

11:06.083 --> 11:07.877
<i>The curious and the puzzled,</i>

11:08.044 --> 11:09.962
<i>and those who were neither.</i>

11:10.629 --> 11:14.342
<i>They could not honestly
have told you why they came.</i>

11:14.884 --> 11:18.512
<i>So, he did what any
sensible American male</i>

11:18.679 --> 11:20.389
<i>of his generation would do:</i>

11:20.973 --> 11:23.809
<i>he began to charge them money.</i>

11:24.185 --> 11:27.355
<i>Nothing much.
A nickel. A quarter.</i>

11:27.521 --> 11:29.357
<i>And he kept building,</i>

11:29.523 --> 11:31.984
<i>and the people kept coming.</i>

11:32.151 --> 11:34.362
<i>So, he took those nickels
and quarters</i>

11:34.528 --> 11:37.948
<i>and made something
even bigger and stranger.</i>

11:38.366 --> 11:40.743
<i>He filled the land
beneath the house</i>

11:40.910 --> 11:43.704
<i>with things for people to see,</i>

11:43.871 --> 11:45.456
<i>and they came.</i>

11:45.623 --> 11:49.293
<i>Millions of them every year.</i>

11:53.130 --> 11:55.424
Sorry, ma'am.
The attraction's closing.

11:55.591 --> 11:57.593
I'll show you out.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.273
You are here for the meeting.

12:53.107 --> 12:55.276
I wasn't formally invited.

12:57.862 --> 13:00.197
Uh. Hello.

13:04.869 --> 13:06.537
- Salim?
- Hi.

13:06.704 --> 13:09.957
What the fuck
are you doing here?

13:11.584 --> 13:13.252
Do you boys
need a minute?

13:20.217 --> 13:25.014
I need the eyes of Argus
on my side to see my enemies.

13:26.724 --> 13:28.934
Make the connection for me.

13:31.520 --> 13:34.523
Black Briar is
for the use of the president.

13:34.982 --> 13:38.944
The president
is a cardboard cut-out.

13:39.111 --> 13:43.324
I am the man behind the men,

13:43.491 --> 13:45.201
behind the man.

13:47.495 --> 13:49.622
Operation Paperclip.

13:50.456 --> 13:52.291
The moon landing.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.585
Roswell.

13:54.752 --> 13:56.921
The Compton Crack Wars.

13:57.087 --> 13:59.590
You work for me.

13:59.757 --> 14:04.720
You... have always
worked for me.

14:06.472 --> 14:08.098
So when I say

14:08.265 --> 14:13.103
I need to see
through the eyes of Argus,

14:13.270 --> 14:16.732
you make the connection.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.777
<i>Oh, it is indeed
a beautiful Easter Sunday</i>

14:19.944 --> 14:22.363
<i>here in the nation's
capital, Tracy.</i>

14:22.530 --> 14:24.448
<i>The East Coast can expect</i>

14:24.615 --> 14:27.368
<i>mostly mild temperatures
and sunshine today,</i>

14:27.535 --> 14:29.161
<i>while our friends
in Kentucky</i>

14:29.328 --> 14:31.247
<i>are still reeling from
a freak weather phenomenon</i>

14:31.413 --> 14:34.208
<i>which has killed thousands of
acres of spring crops.</i>

14:34.375 --> 14:37.086
<i>In other weather news,
there seems to be some trouble</i>

14:37.253 --> 14:38.754
<i>brewing out
in southern Wisconsin</i>

14:38.921 --> 14:40.589
<i>where a severe weather--</i>

15:32.308 --> 15:34.226
What's the hold-up, Shadow?

15:34.935 --> 15:37.354
You're a god, but you can't
open a fucking gate.

15:37.521 --> 15:39.189
You just give me a minute?

15:40.649 --> 15:42.735
You want me to bust it,
Shadow? I can.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.486
Wha--?

15:54.872 --> 15:56.582
Mad Sweeney?

15:57.041 --> 15:58.417
Is that you?

15:59.293 --> 16:02.630
Or is that Wednesday's bullshit
I smell?

16:02.796 --> 16:04.798
A keen nose,
Mr. Fancypants.

16:04.965 --> 16:06.675
But that ain't Irish
sexy you're smelling.

16:07.301 --> 16:09.261
It's Roadkill Rhonda over here.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.889
Nancy!

16:14.224 --> 16:16.393
So, who'd you bring me?
John Henry?

16:16.560 --> 16:19.688
No, choo-choo train.
No John Henry. You know that.

16:19.855 --> 16:21.440
Oh, Whiskey Jack?

16:21.607 --> 16:22.733
No whiskey.

16:22.900 --> 16:24.860
No Whiskey Jack.

16:25.361 --> 16:28.030
- Not even the rabbit?
- Ha!

16:28.572 --> 16:30.741
You are persona non grata
in the rabbit community.

16:30.908 --> 16:32.701
I think you know why.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.913
So, Easter told me to tell you

16:36.080 --> 16:37.247
she ain't coming

16:37.414 --> 16:40.084
on account of you mowing
over bunnies with your car

16:40.250 --> 16:43.128
like some kinda
fucking rabbit racist.

16:45.964 --> 16:47.383
Shadow Moon!

16:47.549 --> 16:50.177
Did I or did I not just thrust
your rusty butt

16:50.344 --> 16:52.137
into bespoke haberdashery

16:52.304 --> 16:54.181
just a few days ago?

16:55.599 --> 16:57.226
You're very welcome
to come to the house,

16:57.393 --> 16:59.228
but you're not
invited to the party.

16:59.395 --> 17:01.271
Oh, I'm just keeping an eye
on my husband.

17:01.438 --> 17:03.315
Well, look at him.
He's got a spring in his step

17:03.482 --> 17:05.150
he didn't have
when he left prison.

17:05.317 --> 17:07.528
Which is strange
since his wife was murdered.

17:08.362 --> 17:11.573
Highways can be
very dangerous places.

17:11.740 --> 17:13.617
If it's any comfort, I know
what it's like to be dead.

17:13.784 --> 17:15.869
I once sacrificed myself
for knowledge.

17:16.036 --> 17:19.123
I-I hung on the great tree,
Yggdrasil,

17:19.289 --> 17:21.208
for nine days and nine nights.

17:21.542 --> 17:23.377
And look at you now,
all alive.

17:23.544 --> 17:25.879
And I learned a great deal.

17:26.296 --> 17:28.716
You don't have
to be roadkill forever.

17:29.717 --> 17:32.720
I'm sure we can come
to an arrangement.

17:34.221 --> 17:37.474
Fuck you and your glass eye.

17:48.902 --> 17:51.864
- Find your coin?
- No such luck.

17:52.573 --> 17:54.992
But I did pick up some trash
along the way.

17:55.159 --> 17:57.035
Figured you might want
your treasure back.

17:57.786 --> 17:59.747
It seems like you found
your lucky charm.

18:02.166 --> 18:04.084
You sound like a man
who'd fight to get back

18:04.251 --> 18:06.253
into those maggoty panties.

18:06.420 --> 18:08.338
You sure that's what you want?

18:19.391 --> 18:21.810
I gave you the freedom
to do anything you wanted.

18:21.977 --> 18:24.938
To go anywhere you wanted.
Why are you here?

18:25.105 --> 18:28.192
This is my anywhere.
I'm following my heart.

18:28.358 --> 18:30.277
But you're not using
your head, Salim.

18:30.444 --> 18:33.113
I am a Jinn.
You are a mortal man.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.033
And yet you need me.
You desire me.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.744
What I desire is to do my job.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.540
This is not a safe place.

18:44.666 --> 18:45.751
Not tonight.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.420
Please, Salim.

18:49.630 --> 18:50.672
Go.

18:51.048 --> 18:52.925
I do not grant wishes.

18:57.679 --> 18:59.973
Hey, Salim-not-Salim.

19:00.516 --> 19:03.769
It is... showtime.

19:06.939 --> 19:09.149
Do I know you? Hubal?

19:09.316 --> 19:10.692
Manat?

19:10.859 --> 19:13.946
No, uh, my name is Salim.
I am with him.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.281
Oh...

19:17.407 --> 19:19.159
So, tell me, do we have
a full house?

19:19.326 --> 19:21.703
I showed them to the carousel,
as you requested.

19:21.870 --> 19:25.874
- How many?
- A dozen, perhaps. No more.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.962
It'll be enough
to light the fire.

19:31.004 --> 19:32.047
There is one...

19:33.173 --> 19:34.591
who was not invited.

19:46.687 --> 19:47.771
Shadow.

19:52.693 --> 19:55.737
- Can't ride without a coin.
- Feck off. Give us a coin now.

19:55.904 --> 19:58.198
She's not on my list,
nor are you.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.200
Come on, shit-for-brains!

20:00.784 --> 20:02.828
You know me!
I'm working for your man!

20:03.954 --> 20:07.499
He was most specific...
about you.

20:18.927 --> 20:20.095
Anansi.

20:29.563 --> 20:31.857
You invited the Old Gods
to your party?

20:33.317 --> 20:35.152
I was old in the desert

20:35.319 --> 20:37.779
before they sacrificed
the first horse to you.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.823
I will be heard.

20:41.408 --> 20:42.784
Unless you are afraid.

20:46.246 --> 20:51.043
The wit and wisdom of Queen
Bilquis defeated King Solomon.

20:53.503 --> 20:55.589
At the start of any new quest
for adventure,

20:55.756 --> 20:59.176
it behooves us to consult
the Norns,

20:59.343 --> 21:01.511
our foretellers of destiny.

21:03.013 --> 21:04.890
After you, Your Majesty.

21:50.519 --> 21:52.437
Oh, that's a good one.

21:52.604 --> 21:54.314
What's it say?

21:54.481 --> 21:56.942
A man's fortune
is his own business, Shadow.

21:58.318 --> 21:59.653
Nobody's sharing?

22:33.854 --> 22:36.189
"Every ending
is a new beginning.

22:36.356 --> 22:38.191
Your lucky number is none.

22:39.776 --> 22:41.737
Your lucky color is dead.

22:42.237 --> 22:43.905
Motto: Like father, like son."

22:44.072 --> 22:47.868
Oh, like all fortunes, Shadow:
opaque on arrival,

22:48.035 --> 22:50.912
inevitable in retrospect.
Shall we?

22:56.168 --> 22:59.713
It's a motherfuckin' fortune
from a fuckin' wax dummy.

23:00.464 --> 23:01.631
Dummy!

23:09.848 --> 23:12.267
Apparently, the houses
in this area were built by

23:12.434 --> 23:15.437
some skinny white motherfucker
named Frank Lloyd Wright.

23:15.979 --> 23:19.149
Some say his evil twin brother
built this one:

23:20.025 --> 23:21.735
Frank Lloyd Wrong.

23:21.902 --> 23:24.154
Another skinny
white motherfucker.

23:25.322 --> 23:26.948
You carry on, Nancy.

23:27.115 --> 23:29.117
I'll catch up with you all
at the Raven.

23:29.284 --> 23:31.203
Indeed.

23:51.515 --> 23:53.850
Zorya Vechernyaya.

23:55.435 --> 23:57.604
Evening star,
lady of the sunset.

23:57.771 --> 24:00.565
Do you know
how beautiful you look?

24:01.274 --> 24:02.818
I am old.

24:03.735 --> 24:06.530
Your tongue
is a wicked thing.

24:06.696 --> 24:08.406
We're both old.

24:08.698 --> 24:11.076
But nobody's ever complained
about my tongue.

24:12.702 --> 24:14.746
You make me young again.

24:15.247 --> 24:16.915
Forget your foolish war!

24:17.082 --> 24:19.126
There will be better times
in the days to come.

24:19.292 --> 24:20.710
I promise you that.

24:27.551 --> 24:29.970
How was your bank robbery,
huh?

24:30.846 --> 24:32.764
It got you here, Czernobog.

24:32.931 --> 24:34.724
And I'm grateful
that you are here.

24:34.891 --> 24:36.351
I'll need your wisdom

24:36.518 --> 24:38.395
as well as your hammer
before we're through.

24:38.562 --> 24:40.230
I'm not here because of you.

24:40.397 --> 24:44.025
I'm here because I lost
a game of checkers to your boy.

24:46.570 --> 24:48.280
Will you join me backstage?

24:48.446 --> 24:50.782
I come in my own time.

24:51.825 --> 24:53.827
I want to hear the music.

24:53.994 --> 24:55.120
It's...

24:56.997 --> 24:58.623
disgusting.

25:12.095 --> 25:13.388
Enjoy.

25:18.143 --> 25:19.394
You wanna dance?

25:26.067 --> 25:27.652
You're a big one.

25:28.653 --> 25:30.655
Built like a brick shithouse.

25:31.364 --> 25:32.657
28-inch shoulders;

25:32.824 --> 25:35.535
long, lean lines.

25:35.869 --> 25:37.954
But your posture's for shit.

25:39.789 --> 25:42.584
Been hunchin' over
your whole life.

25:46.755 --> 25:48.423
When you take a man's
measurements,

25:48.590 --> 25:51.676
you get a bill
for his life expenses.

25:52.302 --> 25:55.764
Little Shadow Moon
was a shrimpy little kid...

25:56.348 --> 25:58.725
roughed around
on the block until what...

25:58.892 --> 26:01.645
14, you put on two feet
and 60 pounds?

26:01.811 --> 26:03.021
Fifteen.

26:05.148 --> 26:07.859
Still 15 on the inside though,
ain't you, boy?

26:10.904 --> 26:14.199
You know, I got a son,
stupid as a man

26:14.366 --> 26:16.701
who bought his stupid
at a two-for-one sale.

26:17.452 --> 26:19.329
You remind me of him.

26:19.496 --> 26:21.414
All right,
well, if you don't mind,

26:21.581 --> 26:23.458
I'll just take that
as a compliment.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.502
Being called late
than a motherfucker

26:25.669 --> 26:28.046
on the day they handed out
brains is a compliment to you?

26:30.423 --> 26:32.717
Being compared
to a member of your family.

26:39.516 --> 26:41.434
You might not be
the worst choice

26:41.601 --> 26:44.020
old One-Eye could have made,
come to that.

26:47.524 --> 26:49.109
Hey, I want a fortune.

26:50.443 --> 26:52.362
All the people coming to your
boss's thing are already here.

26:52.529 --> 26:54.072
- Gimme a coin.
- No.

26:54.239 --> 26:56.032
And I told you two
to get the fuck out.

26:56.199 --> 26:58.118
Don't make her upset.
I have seen what she can do.

26:58.285 --> 27:00.036
Actually, you haven't
even seen like the tiniest-

27:00.203 --> 27:02.247
Just give the fucking
corpse a coin.

27:18.972 --> 27:21.141
- It's broken.
- A broken fortune?

27:21.308 --> 27:22.684
It-it's blank.

27:22.851 --> 27:24.227
Maybe it's because you are dead.

27:24.394 --> 27:25.812
You don't have any more fortune.

27:25.979 --> 27:28.315
I'll write one for you.
In the very near future,

27:28.481 --> 27:30.400
you give the fuckin'
leprechaun his coin back,

27:30.567 --> 27:31.985
lie down, and rot.

27:32.610 --> 27:33.945
Wanna try your luck?

27:35.196 --> 27:37.198
All my luck is yours,
dead wife.

27:37.365 --> 27:40.910
Don't need to read about it.
Just break the fuckin' machine.

27:44.080 --> 27:45.999
So, over the centuries,

27:46.166 --> 27:50.003
people in other countries
felt called to places of power.

27:50.170 --> 27:52.088
They knew there was
an energy there,

27:52.255 --> 27:55.717
a focus point, a channel,
a window to the Immanent.

27:55.884 --> 27:58.928
And they built churches,
cathedrals,

27:59.095 --> 28:01.973
or they'd, they'd erect
a stone circle.

28:02.140 --> 28:03.808
Well, you get the idea.

28:03.975 --> 28:05.894
But there's churches
all through the States.

28:06.061 --> 28:07.979
No, in the good old USA,

28:08.146 --> 28:10.273
people still heed the call
of the transcendent void,

28:10.440 --> 28:12.150
but they respond to it

28:12.317 --> 28:14.069
by building a model
out of beer bottles

28:14.235 --> 28:15.737
of somewhere
they've never visited,

28:15.904 --> 28:17.906
or by erecting
a giant bat house

28:18.073 --> 28:19.574
in some part of the country

28:19.741 --> 28:21.826
that bats have traditionally
declined to visit.

28:22.410 --> 28:24.537
Or they sell T-shirts
and hotdogs.

28:24.704 --> 28:26.164
Roadside attractions!

28:26.331 --> 28:28.875
Where they buy that hotdog
and they buy that T-shirt.

28:29.042 --> 28:32.003
And then they wander around
feeling satisfied on a level

28:32.170 --> 28:34.130
that they cannot truly describe,

28:34.297 --> 28:37.926
and profoundly dissatisfied
on a level beneath that.

28:38.093 --> 28:40.428
You know, you have got some
pretty whacked-out theories.

28:40.595 --> 28:44.099
Nothing theoretical about it,
you should know that by now.

28:44.432 --> 28:47.477
Time... to ride.

29:16.589 --> 29:18.550
Feel the power, Shadow.

29:26.641 --> 29:31.104
Like a prayer wheel going round
and round, accumulating power.

29:31.604 --> 29:33.523
Gazed upon by the faithful.

29:59.841 --> 30:01.718
If you follow the signs,

30:01.885 --> 30:04.095
you'll never have
any mother-fucking fun!

30:08.933 --> 30:10.935
Won't you join us, Shadow?

30:12.562 --> 30:14.355
I'll keep you safe.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.724
You having fun yet, Shadow?

30:59.025 --> 31:00.485
Ride 'em, Nancy.

32:10.096 --> 32:12.140
Where the fuck am I now?

32:14.267 --> 32:15.476
Hey.

32:20.773 --> 32:22.900
How long was I out for?

32:32.076 --> 32:33.578
I'm dreaming.

32:36.205 --> 32:37.665
It is real.

32:39.083 --> 32:40.793
We're just backstage.

32:41.836 --> 32:43.546
Waiting in the wings.

32:44.297 --> 32:47.300
Inside Wednesday's memories.

32:48.926 --> 32:50.845
All right, so, you... what...?

32:51.012 --> 32:53.056
You're saying we're in his head?

32:53.222 --> 32:54.766
More or less.

33:00.813 --> 33:03.858
Wait! But I can...
I can feel the cold.

33:04.025 --> 33:06.861
- I-I can smell the air.
- Of course.

33:07.028 --> 33:10.239
If this meeting were being held
in my head, it would be warm.

33:10.823 --> 33:14.369
The breeze from the incense
markets would be intoxicating.

33:14.911 --> 33:18.206
There would be hanging gardens
and golden ziggurats...

33:18.706 --> 33:22.460
and silken beds
in which to make love.

34:31.070 --> 34:33.531
Time for a story!

34:35.700 --> 34:37.368
'Cause sometimes,

34:38.244 --> 34:41.789
people need reminding
of things.

34:41.956 --> 34:44.667
We have been fighting...

34:45.501 --> 34:50.381
since the Portuguese invaded
the Gold Coast of Ghana!

34:51.883 --> 34:54.886
We stay at war.

34:56.012 --> 34:58.973
And just because we are few

34:59.140 --> 35:00.850
and they are many,

35:01.017 --> 35:04.604
does not mean

35:04.771 --> 35:07.732
that we are lost!

35:13.821 --> 35:16.949
When people
first came to America,

35:17.116 --> 35:19.243
they brought us with you.

35:20.495 --> 35:25.249
Me, Loki, Thor, Nancy...

35:26.167 --> 35:29.504
the Lion-God, all of you.

35:30.838 --> 35:33.174
We rode in their minds
and took root.

35:33.716 --> 35:37.553
But gradually, they abandoned us
for a better deal.

35:38.221 --> 35:40.515
A new life in a new land.

35:41.974 --> 35:45.978
Our true believers passed away,
or stopped believing.

35:46.562 --> 35:48.648
Left us to fend
for ourselves,

35:48.815 --> 35:52.235
to get by
on what little smidgens

35:52.401 --> 35:55.154
of belief or worship
we could find.

35:55.321 --> 35:58.157
And that's what we've done.
We've gotten by.

35:58.741 --> 36:01.994
We live in cracks
at the edges of society.

36:02.161 --> 36:04.914
Old, forgotten Gods

36:05.081 --> 36:07.333
in a land without Gods.

36:07.500 --> 36:10.044
But there are New Gods
growing in America.

36:10.211 --> 36:12.463
They've already replaced us.

36:12.839 --> 36:15.675
Now they want
to destroy us, completely,

36:15.842 --> 36:20.179
and if you think otherwise,
you are fooling yourselves.

36:20.346 --> 36:22.515
You want us to go to war?

36:22.849 --> 36:27.687
You called everyone here
for this nonsense?

36:27.854 --> 36:32.441
Most of us have lived in peace
in this country for a long time.

36:32.608 --> 36:35.236
I have seen the New Gods rise.

36:35.403 --> 36:37.530
I have seen them fall!

36:38.990 --> 36:42.118
- I say we wait.
- Czernobog is with us.

36:42.285 --> 36:44.579
He has brought his hammer
to the fight.

36:44.745 --> 36:49.792
Yeah, when the time is right,
my hammer will swing.

36:49.959 --> 36:51.878
And we will need it.

36:52.044 --> 36:55.339
Believe me, these New Gods
are not going anywhere soon.

36:55.923 --> 36:59.093
From one God of War
to another...

36:59.969 --> 37:03.306
when I look out my window,
I see no battlefields.

37:03.472 --> 37:05.266
I hear no war cries.

37:05.641 --> 37:08.644
Then you are not
looking hard enough, Mama-ji.

37:09.145 --> 37:10.605
Odin's right.

37:12.565 --> 37:15.401
These New Gods
have more followers,

37:15.568 --> 37:17.153
more attention,

37:17.320 --> 37:19.155
more power

37:19.322 --> 37:20.823
than we ever did.

37:20.990 --> 37:22.617
Where he is wrong...

37:23.826 --> 37:25.995
is in thinking
this is a bad thing.

37:27.747 --> 37:30.499
They showed me
how to use their tools.

37:30.917 --> 37:35.504
Now I can bring my message
directly to my people.

37:36.339 --> 37:39.342
I accept my worship, my way.

37:39.508 --> 37:42.303
And I grow in power.

37:42.470 --> 37:44.680
The choice is yours.

37:46.182 --> 37:49.518
Evolve or die.

37:57.777 --> 37:59.111
I believe him.

38:13.876 --> 38:15.628
I lost everyone.

38:19.674 --> 38:23.886
Everyone that I...
I ever cared about.

38:25.638 --> 38:27.181
Everything I knew.

38:29.600 --> 38:31.060
To a point where I...

38:32.186 --> 38:33.980
I forgot who I was.

38:37.316 --> 38:38.776
Lost my light.

38:40.403 --> 38:41.988
That's what my mom
would've said.

38:46.826 --> 38:48.035
But Wednesday...

38:52.415 --> 38:53.791
Odin...

38:56.585 --> 38:58.129
...is helping me remember.

38:59.672 --> 39:02.675
He's giving me the chance
to, to be worthy

39:02.842 --> 39:05.177
of, of that unwavering faith
and belief

39:05.344 --> 39:08.556
that- that my mother
once had in me. And...

39:09.724 --> 39:11.767
it sounds to me like he's
offering you the same thing.

39:11.934 --> 39:14.937
So, why won't you just
let him help you?

39:17.314 --> 39:18.774
Just help him.

39:20.026 --> 39:23.237
Help him remind the people
who you are!

39:23.404 --> 39:25.281
Regain the faith
of your Creator
