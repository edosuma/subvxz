Oh thank you.

01:56.834 --> 01:57.969
My favorite.

01:58.002 --> 01:59.003
I might have
another one for you.

01:59.037 --> 02:00.138
Really?

02:00.170 --> 02:01.739
Oh boy.

02:01.773 --> 02:03.908

02:08.079 --> 02:09.113

02:09.146 --> 02:10.782
That's my son Lance over there.

02:10.815 --> 02:12.215
- Hey, how you doing?
- Ken Glinevich.

02:12.249 --> 02:14.052
Kim is my girlfriend.

02:14.085 --> 02:16.253
Okay, well, welcome
to the neighborhood.

02:16.286 --> 02:18.856
- A bit of a weirdo?
- Ken.

02:20.424 --> 02:21.559
That's funny.

02:21.592 --> 02:23.828
I wouldn't say
weirdo, maybe weird.

02:23.861 --> 02:25.362
- Okay, well.
- But without the O.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.397
Leave your weird on the side,

02:27.431 --> 02:29.734
'cause we don't do
weird over here.

02:29.767 --> 02:31.069
Okay.

02:31.102 --> 02:32.103
Could you do me a favor?

02:32.136 --> 02:33.771
Could you take those for me?

02:33.805 --> 02:35.205
Okay, thank you.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.708
- Right here, put this inside.

There we go.

02:40.978 --> 02:44.214
The sun is out,
so my guns are out.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.382
- I'm sorry.
- Come on ladies.

02:45.415 --> 02:46.684
- Back to work.
- Nice to meet you.

02:46.718 --> 02:48.485
- Alright.

02:48.518 --> 02:50.320
Let me know if
you need my help.

02:50.353 --> 02:52.990
- Sorry.
- Open the door.

02:53.024 --> 02:55.392
Sorry about that.

02:55.425 --> 02:56.794

02:56.828 --> 02:58.596

02:58.629 --> 02:59.597
- I got it.
- So you been here a while?

02:59.630 --> 03:00.665
My mom's house.

03:00.698 --> 03:01.833
Your mom lives here too?

03:01.866 --> 03:02.700
No.

03:04.001 --> 03:06.637
She passed about five years ago.

03:06.671 --> 03:08.271
Sorry about that.

03:10.507 --> 03:12.409
She's a nice girl.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.011
She lives here, too?

03:14.045 --> 03:15.813
Her name's Truth.

03:15.847 --> 03:17.280
What kind of name is that?

03:17.314 --> 03:19.751
Well.

03:19.784 --> 03:22.053
I always forget to ask her.

04:08.666 --> 04:09.499
Alright.

04:11.702 --> 04:13.271
Woo, that is it.

04:13.303 --> 04:14.437
- We are done.
- That's it?

04:14.471 --> 04:15.606
We are done, thank you.

04:15.640 --> 04:17.175

- Come here, come here.

04:17.208 --> 04:18.108
- Thank you, thank you.
- You're the best.

04:18.142 --> 04:19.309
What would I do without you?

04:19.341 --> 04:20.476
You know what
you'd do without me?

04:20.510 --> 04:21.779
- You'd go unsatisfied.
- Stop it.

04:21.813 --> 04:23.080
Stop.

04:23.114 --> 04:24.682
- I gotta go.
- Okay.

04:24.715 --> 04:26.383
What, what do you
mean you gotta go?

04:26.416 --> 04:27.618
I gotta go, yeah.

04:27.652 --> 04:28.418
Aren't you gonna
help and unpack?

04:28.451 --> 04:29.654
No.

04:29.687 --> 04:32.522
Van Steed's mom's dog
is in the hospital.

04:32.557 --> 04:33.791
- His mom's dog's in...
- Yeah.

04:33.825 --> 04:34.792
- You alright with that?
- Okay, that's fine.

04:34.826 --> 04:36.027
- Alright.
- That's fine.

04:36.060 --> 04:36.961
We'll visit, Lance
and I can do it.

04:36.994 --> 04:38.129
Plus, it'll be good for him

04:38.162 --> 04:39.897
to get a little manual
labor in, right?

04:39.931 --> 04:41.265
What's that supposed to mean?

04:41.299 --> 04:42.266
- Ken, no, stop.
- It means you're a twink,

04:42.300 --> 04:43.835
and you need to get a
little muscle on you.

04:43.868 --> 04:45.069
- Okay go take care of the dog.
- Is that what you call that?

04:45.102 --> 04:46.971
Yeah that's what I call that.

04:47.004 --> 04:47.905
- Go ahead, touch it.
- I won't touch that.

04:47.939 --> 04:49.173
Touch it, come on.

04:49.207 --> 04:50.107
- You know you want to touch it.
- Mom.

04:50.141 --> 04:51.042
- Let's go, come on.
- What's the matter?

04:51.075 --> 04:52.310
You gotta learn how
to defend yourself.

04:52.342 --> 04:52.977
Let's go, the dog
needs your help.

04:53.010 --> 04:54.946
Wiseacre.

04:54.979 --> 04:56.314
- Alright babe, I gotta go.
- We'll be fine.

04:56.346 --> 04:58.115
- Thank you, love you.
- Thank you, love you.

04:58.149 --> 04:59.016
I do, I love you.

04:59.050 --> 05:00.751
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

05:00.785 --> 05:02.019
Alright.

05:02.053 --> 05:03.054
We gotta go.

05:05.189 --> 05:06.389
- Let's get to your mom's dog.
- I'm sorry.

05:06.423 --> 05:08.092
Real gentleman, huh?

05:08.125 --> 05:09.827
- You'll learn to love him.
- Will I?

05:09.861 --> 05:11.329
He grows on you.

05:11.361 --> 05:12.763
- Is that possible?
- Come here.

05:12.797 --> 05:13.965
Give me a hug.

05:15.333 --> 05:17.635
We'll be fine, I promise.

05:17.668 --> 05:18.936
I don't know.

05:20.037 --> 05:21.305
It's all gonna be good.

05:21.339 --> 05:23.440
- Okay?
- I know.

05:23.473 --> 05:24.742
Don't let go.

06:23.100 --> 06:23.935
Okay.

07:43.814 --> 07:44.715
What the...

08:32.063 --> 08:33.063
Is that a...

08:36.534 --> 08:37.802
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,

08:37.835 --> 08:40.504
oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

08:49.213 --> 08:51.182
Are you okay?

08:51.215 --> 08:52.483
Me?

08:52.516 --> 08:53.417
Yeah.

08:53.451 --> 08:54.685
Are you sure?

08:54.718 --> 08:57.455
You look like you
just saw a ghost.

09:07.131 --> 09:08.332
Lundquist Industries.

09:08.365 --> 09:10.000
This is Elena, how
may I help you?

09:10.034 --> 09:10.835
Please hold.

09:10.868 --> 09:11.669
Yes?

09:11.702 --> 09:13.471
A moment, sir?

09:13.504 --> 09:14.438
What is it?

09:14.472 --> 09:15.806
May I come in?

09:16.941 --> 09:17.775
Yes.

09:23.414 --> 09:25.649
It's been activated, sir.

09:27.184 --> 09:28.119
What has?

09:30.454 --> 09:31.789
The prototype.

09:34.291 --> 09:36.026
What prototype.

09:36.060 --> 09:37.795
The prototype, sir.

09:55.846 --> 09:58.015
What are we looking for?

10:06.724 --> 10:07.559
Okay.

10:10.828 --> 10:12.296
It was right here.

10:12.329 --> 10:13.598
I swear.

10:13.632 --> 10:14.798
What was?

10:14.832 --> 10:17.468
The little thing, what
I was talking about.

10:17.501 --> 10:19.503
It was right here, it
was under this sheet.

10:19.537 --> 10:21.739
The little green thing.

10:21.772 --> 10:23.340
Okay.

10:23.374 --> 10:24.842
I gotta give it to you, Lance.

10:24.875 --> 10:28.212
This is the most creative
excuse I've ever heard.

10:28.245 --> 10:29.280
If you just wanted to hang out,

10:29.313 --> 10:31.248
I'm right across the street.

10:31.282 --> 10:33.217
I really gotta give it
to you, Lance, props.

10:33.250 --> 10:34.084
Come on.

10:35.920 --> 10:40.324
Come on.

10:40.357 --> 10:41.626
This was fun.

10:41.660 --> 10:43.194
So I guess I'll be
seeing you around.

10:43.227 --> 10:45.229
Whoa whoa whoa, wait a second.

10:45.262 --> 10:46.631
Did you see that?

10:49.400 --> 10:50.201
Come on.

11:01.680 --> 11:04.348
Lance, what are we...

11:04.381 --> 11:05.382
Sh, quiet.

11:14.659 --> 11:16.493
Lance, what is that?

11:21.600 --> 11:23.000
I have no idea.

11:38.148 --> 11:39.250
Truth, what are you doing?

11:39.283 --> 11:41.352
Hey baby, what are you doing?

11:41.385 --> 11:42.186
No no no.

11:42.219 --> 11:43.688
Hey little buddy.

11:43.722 --> 11:45.322
What are you doing?

11:47.659 --> 11:50.027
- Truth, Truth.
- Lance, stop.

11:51.161 --> 11:52.664
He's kind of cute.

11:52.697 --> 11:54.832
He's like a little baby
Frankenstein or something.

11:54.865 --> 11:56.668
Don't call him that.

11:58.435 --> 11:59.370
It's okay, little dude.

11:59.403 --> 12:01.405
We're not gonna hurt you.

12:12.950 --> 12:15.720
What do you think he is?

12:15.754 --> 12:17.589
I have no idea.

12:17.622 --> 12:18.856
- Who's that?
- Shit.

12:18.889 --> 12:20.491
Hey Lancey, what
are you doing?

12:20.524 --> 12:23.695
You having a little
make out party?

12:23.728 --> 12:24.562
Holy...

12:26.063 --> 12:28.265
- Oh my God, what the...
- No.

12:28.299 --> 12:29.133
Whoa.

12:30.034 --> 12:31.670
What is that?

12:31.703 --> 12:32.637
Glinevich.

12:32.671 --> 12:34.171
Careful.

12:34.204 --> 12:34.838
- Don't hurt him.
- Hey!

12:34.872 --> 12:36.073
Please don't hurt him.

12:36.106 --> 12:38.976
Hey little poop poop poop
poop poop. Are you a poop poop?

12:40.578 --> 12:42.413
- Don't say that.
- Oh yeah, no no no.

12:42.446 --> 12:44.214
That thing, stay calm everybody.

12:44.248 --> 12:45.316
- I got this.
- No, no, leave him alone.

12:45.349 --> 12:46.517
- I got this.
- Stop.

12:46.551 --> 12:47.451
Hey!

12:47.484 --> 12:49.086
Stay right there, no no no, hey.

12:49.119 --> 12:50.521
Don't go, come here.

12:50.555 --> 12:51.355
No!

12:53.290 --> 12:55.459
Stop, let him go.

12:55.492 --> 12:57.696
Let him go, stop, stop.

12:57.729 --> 12:59.296
Get back here.

12:59.330 --> 13:00.665
Come on dude, stop.

13:00.699 --> 13:01.599
- Don't do that.
- Oh my God, what's going on?

13:01.633 --> 13:02.866
Glinevich, stop running.

13:02.900 --> 13:04.703
You're too fat.

13:04.736 --> 13:05.903
- Where'd he go?
- What has happened?

13:05.936 --> 13:06.870
Where'd it go?

13:06.904 --> 13:08.105
- No.
- Where'd it go?

13:08.138 --> 13:10.341
It was like a little
green Dale Earnhardt.

13:10.374 --> 13:12.276
Stop, he's gone, he's gone.

13:12.309 --> 13:14.713
- Stop stop.
- No hey, wait.

13:14.746 --> 13:17.247
This way, I could smell him.

13:18.415 --> 13:20.517
Glinevich,
what are you doing?

13:20.552 --> 13:23.053
Lance, do you have any
idea what that thing is?

13:23.087 --> 13:24.955
This is a Chupacabra, my friend.

13:24.988 --> 13:26.223
- Okay?
- What?

13:26.256 --> 13:27.692
And do you have
any idea how much

13:27.726 --> 13:30.260
National Geography will pay
for a carcass like that?

13:30.294 --> 13:32.896
- You can't kill him!
- Oh sweetie, sweetie.

13:32.930 --> 13:33.765
I'm a man.

13:34.799 --> 13:36.033
I'm a hunter.

13:36.066 --> 13:39.604
I do what God put me on
this Earth to do, okay?

13:39.637 --> 13:40.938
Alright?

13:40.971 --> 13:42.774
Plus, I can use the money.

13:42.807 --> 13:45.643
What are you talking about?

13:45.677 --> 13:46.910
Come on.

13:46.944 --> 13:48.145
- We're coming with you than.
- Get in!

13:48.178 --> 13:50.314
Get your little
butts in the car.

13:50.347 --> 13:52.684
- Oh my God.
- Let's do this!

13:53.484 --> 13:54.318
Manhunt.

14:08.399 --> 14:09.634
Glinevich, your shoe's untied.

14:09.667 --> 14:11.669
Where'd you go,
you little monster?

14:11.703 --> 14:14.572
Oh, you didn't
fall for it, did you?

14:14.606 --> 14:16.006
Alright kids.

14:16.039 --> 14:17.541
The woods is no
place for ladies,

14:17.575 --> 14:18.942
so you guys stay right here.

14:18.976 --> 14:20.144
You, stay right there.

14:20.177 --> 14:21.378
Van Steed and I are going in.

14:21.412 --> 14:23.581
You stay here, keep
an eye on things.

14:23.615 --> 14:25.416
Got it, good.

14:25.449 --> 14:26.618
Good luck, you two.

14:26.651 --> 14:28.152
Watch out for the Chupacabra.

14:28.185 --> 14:31.155
Oh wait, there it is!

14:31.188 --> 14:32.590
Easy, guys, easy.

14:36.059 --> 14:37.394
These two idiots.

14:37.428 --> 14:41.098
Those two idiots are
never gonna find him.

14:43.601 --> 14:47.237
Come here, you
little Chupacabra.

14:47.271 --> 14:52.276
Think how much money we're
gonna make off of this thing.

15:07.524 --> 15:08.459
This way?

15:12.697 --> 15:13.530
Yeah.

15:18.469 --> 15:20.237
Hey Chupacabra.

15:20.270 --> 15:21.606
Hey Chupa Chupa.

15:41.759 --> 15:44.027
Are there any
animals out here?

15:44.061 --> 15:47.431
- Like muskrats, or...
- Muskrats?

15:47.464 --> 15:49.466
- Mountain lions.
- Maybe bears.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.201
Take down a
muskrat, don't you?

15:51.235 --> 15:53.070
- I don't know.
- Look pretty fierce.

15:55.072 --> 15:56.306
There he is.

15:56.340 --> 15:58.408
Careful, don't spook him.

15:58.442 --> 16:00.678
What's he doing?

16:01.579 --> 16:03.080
Hey little dude.

16:04.582 --> 16:06.350
What's up, man?

16:06.383 --> 16:10.420
- He's so cool.
- Hey buddy, how are you?

16:10.454 --> 16:12.991
What you doing over there?

16:13.023 --> 16:15.025
It's okay.

16:15.058 --> 16:16.326
Hey, it's okay.

16:17.996 --> 16:20.330
Maybe he'll like you more.

16:22.232 --> 16:24.569
- It's okay.
- Look, he's chewing.

16:24.602 --> 16:26.905
You got something in your mouth?

16:26.938 --> 16:27.839
Or is he...

16:29.439 --> 16:30.842
- Gum, gum?
- He's mimicking the gum.

16:30.875 --> 16:32.242
Yeah, that's what it is.

16:32.276 --> 16:33.978
Give him a piece,
see what he does.

16:34.012 --> 16:35.412
- Minty fresh?
- Here, little buddy.

16:35.445 --> 16:36.280
Unwrap it first, though.

16:36.313 --> 16:38.115
Want to try it?

16:38.148 --> 16:38.983
Come here.

16:40.317 --> 16:41.586
He's into it.

16:46.123 --> 16:47.892
Oh he likes it, look.

16:49.493 --> 16:50.962
Don't swallow it now.

16:50.995 --> 16:52.730
It stays in your stomach
for like six years.

16:52.764 --> 16:55.165
Come here, Chupa Chupa.

16:55.198 --> 16:56.868
Come here, Chupa Chupa.

16:56.901 --> 16:58.435
It's Glinevich.

16:58.468 --> 16:59.704
Go go go go go.

17:04.241 --> 17:06.743
Come here, you little Chupa.

17:08.478 --> 17:09.313
Chupa.

17:10.180 --> 17:11.683
Easy, Chupa Chupa.

17:18.623 --> 17:20.758
He's just passing by.

17:29.333 --> 17:31.603
Okay, look, he's leaving.

17:35.573 --> 17:36.941
Alright, they passed us.

17:36.975 --> 17:38.475
Come on, let's go.

17:40.444 --> 17:41.813
- Come on, it's okay.
- Come on buddy.

17:41.846 --> 17:43.881
- Come on little dude.
- You can trust us, come on.

17:43.915 --> 17:44.983
Come on buddy, don't worry.

17:45.016 --> 17:45.917
- Come on baby.
- You're okay.

17:45.950 --> 17:47.652
You're okay, come on buddy.

17:47.685 --> 17:50.220
You can trust us, come on.

17:50.253 --> 17:51.623
It's alright.

17:51.656 --> 17:53.024
There you go.

17:53.057 --> 17:54.993
There we go, alright.

17:56.460 --> 17:57.962
Let's go this way.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.366
Make sure he doesn't
spit the gum out.

18:02.399 --> 18:04.669
I don't want him to litter.

18:32.429 --> 18:33.430
Hi neighbor.

18:33.463 --> 18:34.364
Hey, how are you?

18:34.398 --> 18:35.265
I'm good.

18:35.298 --> 18:36.934
The house looks so good.

18:36.968 --> 18:39.937
Oh man, I get so
into this once a year.

18:39.971 --> 18:42.707
Mine looks so boring
now compared to yours.

18:42.740 --> 18:43.641
Well, I got plenty.

18:43.675 --> 18:45.109
I could decorate your side.

18:45.143 --> 18:46.443
I could do your whole house.

18:46.476 --> 18:47.879
- You would do that?
- Your porch, backyard.

18:47.912 --> 18:51.582
Nice.

18:52.984 --> 18:56.219
Come on, come on
buddy, good boy.

18:56.253 --> 18:58.022
There he is.

18:58.056 --> 18:59.757
Come on, bud.

18:59.791 --> 19:01.893
No leaves, come on.

19:01.926 --> 19:03.161
Well that spider's
a little creepy.

19:03.193 --> 19:05.096
Careful, don't get too close.

19:05.129 --> 19:06.496
Oh, I hope it doesn't bite.

19:06.530 --> 19:09.533
- Yeah.
- It's so nice.

19:09.567 --> 19:10.467
Hey!

19:10.500 --> 19:13.303
Ken, what are you doing?

19:13.336 --> 19:15.006
Hey, where's Lance?

19:15.039 --> 19:17.407
I just got
home, I don't know.

19:17.441 --> 19:18.843
Good afternoon.

19:20.578 --> 19:21.511
Hi?

19:21.545 --> 19:24.916
Can I help you?

19:24.949 --> 19:27.018
What the heck is
going on with his shoes?

19:27.051 --> 19:29.453
I was wondering if any of
you had seen this individual?

19:29.486 --> 19:32.056
We have information suggesting
he's in the neighborhood.

19:33.256 --> 19:35.193
Wait wait wait, get back.

19:35.225 --> 19:37.028
Get back here.

19:37.061 --> 19:39.229
Hold on a second.

19:39.262 --> 19:40.631
He's quite dangerous,

19:40.665 --> 19:42.332
- so if you should see him.
- Dangerous?

19:42.365 --> 19:44.769
Please call that
number immediately.

19:44.802 --> 19:47.805
Whoa, there's a 50,000
dollar reward for this thing?

19:47.839 --> 19:49.539
- Yes sir.
- 50,000 dollars.

19:49.574 --> 19:51.809
Regardless of our
suspect's short stature,

19:51.843 --> 19:54.011
- I assure you he's...
- Cash?

19:55.378 --> 19:56.379
Well, yes.

19:58.315 --> 19:59.784
I just moved here.

19:59.817 --> 20:00.818
- I haven't seen anything.
- What does he look like?

20:00.852 --> 20:01.953
I got the picture right here,

20:01.986 --> 20:03.487
- you idiot.
- Come on, let's go.

20:03.520 --> 20:04.822
What are you
doing out in public?

20:04.856 --> 20:07.158
Again, he's quite dangerous.

20:07.191 --> 20:09.594
So should any of
you encounter him,

20:09.627 --> 20:12.964
please let us know immediately.

20:12.997 --> 20:13.998
Thank you.

20:23.406 --> 20:24.976
What the heck are we gonna do?

20:25.009 --> 20:26.409
50,000 dollars.

20:26.443 --> 20:28.445
- We have to hide him.
- But what are we gonna do?

20:28.478 --> 20:30.948
- I have an idea.
- Idea.

20:30.982 --> 20:32.315
Come on, come.

20:35.219 --> 20:37.688
No, I mean, have
you seen anything?

20:37.722 --> 20:39.624
No, that doesn't
happen around here.

20:39.657 --> 20:42.226
This whole
neighborhood's changing.

20:43.527 --> 20:45.462
I need to move, I
really need to move.

20:45.495 --> 20:47.665
I don't know, I'm
gonna go check on Lance

20:47.698 --> 20:49.332
and make sure he's okay.

20:49.366 --> 20:50.935
- Yeah, let me know.
- Okay.

20:50.968 --> 20:51.769
Bye.

20:53.470 --> 20:55.873
- Happy decorating.
- Thank you.

20:56.941 --> 20:58.242
I'll get yours later.

20:58.276 --> 20:59.309
Aw, thanks.

21:11.756 --> 21:12.924
There we go.

21:14.692 --> 21:19.529
Come on little dude.

21:22.033 --> 21:23.366
- No way.
- No way.

21:24.302 --> 21:25.303
Lance.

21:25.335 --> 21:26.671
- Yeah.
- No, Lance.

21:26.704 --> 21:28.873
- Oh yeah.
- Okay, well.

21:28.906 --> 21:29.907
Oh just, no.

21:32.109 --> 21:33.811
Lance, come on. We're
not supposed to be here.

21:33.845 --> 21:35.478
We were just taking him here.

21:35.512 --> 21:36.981
Just one game.

21:37.014 --> 21:39.449
I haven't bowled since I
was a little kid, come on.

21:39.482 --> 21:40.952
We really shouldn't
be doing this.

21:40.985 --> 21:42.186
- Look at these lights.
- Look, we're not supposed

21:42.220 --> 21:44.055
to be here, and I
don't want my bosses...

21:44.088 --> 21:46.591
Come on, what
shoe size are you?

21:46.624 --> 21:47.825
- Live a little.
- I can't have

21:47.859 --> 21:49.660
Mr. Spintho and Mr.
Spintho walk in.

21:49.694 --> 21:50.628
Mr. Spintho, Mr. Spintho.

21:50.661 --> 21:52.330
Come on, what shoe size are you?

21:52.362 --> 21:54.265
Okay, just one game, okay?

21:54.298 --> 21:55.867
I'm telling you, just one.

21:55.900 --> 21:58.269
Yeah yeah, just one
game, come on, what size?

21:58.302 --> 22:00.872
- One.
- One, promise.

22:00.905 --> 22:03.107
- One game.
- Come on.

22:08.713 --> 22:10.348
- What is happening?
- What are you doing?

22:10.380 --> 22:12.149
We're bowling.

22:12.183 --> 22:13.483
Come on man.

22:13.516 --> 22:16.419
We're playing, we're
not eating air.

22:16.453 --> 22:18.956
- I'm actually over it.
- Lucky number 10. Here we go.

22:31.969 --> 22:33.604
Get the ball towards the pins.

22:33.638 --> 22:36.641
Get the ball, swing
your arm to the back.

22:39.010 --> 22:40.311
I look like an idiot.

22:40.344 --> 22:41.712
Not feel pain, I don't know.

22:41.746 --> 22:44.081
- Oh, you better go.
- My turn.

22:52.223 --> 22:53.024
Promise.

22:56.594 --> 22:58.863
Bring it back to
your right shoulder.

22:58.896 --> 22:59.897
I'm left handed.

22:59.931 --> 23:02.366
- Left shoulder.
- Left shoulder.

23:04.001 --> 23:06.469
Let the momentum of the ball.

23:14.211 --> 23:15.379
Good, awesome.

23:16.280 --> 23:18.282
You're not bad either.

26:00.778 --> 26:02.746
Lance, Lance, wake up.

26:03.848 --> 26:04.682
What?

26:06.917 --> 26:08.319
I hear someone.

26:09.753 --> 26:11.689
God, what time is it?

26:13.157 --> 26:14.325
Where is he?

26:15.594 --> 26:16.427
He's gone.

26:44.922 --> 26:46.257
- Whoa, yo!
- Yikes.

26:46.290 --> 26:48.159
Where'd you come from?

26:48.192 --> 26:50.694
Halloween a little early, huh?

26:51.630 --> 26:52.997
Geeze.

26:58.769 --> 27:00.137
I think he wants to...

27:00.171 --> 27:01.606
You want to help?

27:01.640 --> 27:03.073
I think he wants to do it.

27:03.107 --> 27:04.609
You want to try?

27:05.776 --> 27:06.710
Show him.

27:23.861 --> 27:24.695
Wipe.

27:25.829 --> 27:26.665
Very good.

27:28.165 --> 27:29.733
That's it, that's it.

27:29.767 --> 27:31.435
Now put 'em in here.

27:36.307 --> 27:38.809
Man, that's a great costume.

27:39.944 --> 27:41.545
Hey, Mr. Spintho.

27:41.580 --> 27:43.247
Hey Mr. Spintho.

27:43.280 --> 27:44.515
How are you guys doing today?

27:44.548 --> 27:45.749
What's going on there?

27:45.783 --> 27:47.586
I see you got a
new helper here.

27:47.619 --> 27:50.788
I gotta tell you, my
kids love Halloween too.

27:50.821 --> 27:52.022
I dress up still.

27:52.056 --> 27:54.158
I love the costumes,
the parties.

27:54.191 --> 27:56.260
Are you taking your
little brother tomorrow?

27:56.293 --> 27:57.728
You ought to,
he's freaking scary.

27:57.761 --> 27:59.196
That's a great costume.

27:59.230 --> 28:01.298
Sounds like a
lot of fun, yeah.

28:01.332 --> 28:02.333
Let's go.

28:02.366 --> 28:04.301
- Come on baby, let's go.
- Bye bye.

28:04.335 --> 28:05.169
Come on.

28:05.202 --> 28:06.638
Alright thanks guys!

28:06.671 --> 28:07.572
Okay guys, thanks.

28:07.606 --> 28:08.772
Bye Mr. Spintho, thanks.

28:08.806 --> 28:10.307
- Bring me back some candy!
- Okay.

28:10.341 --> 28:12.343
And Truth,
next time you crash here,

28:12.376 --> 28:14.613
please turn out the lights.

28:28.593 --> 28:30.394
Did you really
have to bring him?

28:30.427 --> 28:31.929
What am I gonna do,
leave him in the van?

28:31.962 --> 28:33.530
Yeah, he's like
a lost puppy dog.

28:33.565 --> 28:35.866
Oh!

28:35.899 --> 28:37.534
Yes, this is it.

28:37.569 --> 28:39.003
This is the one.

28:39.036 --> 28:41.105
This is the one.

28:41.138 --> 28:43.941
- Oh God, that one?
- Oh yeah.

28:46.410 --> 28:48.178
- No.
- Yes, yes, yes.

28:49.346 --> 28:51.048
- No, no.
- Hey.

28:51.081 --> 28:52.617
This is it, baby, this is it.

28:52.651 --> 28:54.118
- Hey hi there, welcome.
- Oh.

28:54.151 --> 28:55.352
Hey John, you work here?

28:55.386 --> 28:57.087
Yeah, well, if you
want to call it that.

28:57.121 --> 28:58.322
- Nice.
- Ah.

28:58.355 --> 29:00.491
What are you doing
out in public?

29:00.524 --> 29:01.626
Hi Glinevich.

29:01.660 --> 29:03.427
Hey, weirdo.

29:03.460 --> 29:05.029
Listen.

29:05.062 --> 29:07.298
- I am looking for a couch.
- She found it!

29:07.331 --> 29:08.700
- This is it.
- No I did not.

29:08.733 --> 29:10.769
Not really sure what I want,

29:10.801 --> 29:13.237
but I do know that I don't
want to spend a lot of money.

29:13.270 --> 29:14.438
I understand.

29:14.471 --> 29:15.674
I'm not really sure
what I can afford.

29:15.707 --> 29:18.075
Well, we got a great
financial, you know,

29:18.108 --> 29:19.343
different plans, layaway,

29:19.376 --> 29:20.578
you came to the right place.

29:20.612 --> 29:21.512
What kind of couch?

29:21.545 --> 29:22.747
I don't know, I kind of like...

29:22.781 --> 29:24.014
This kind of couch,
this kind of couch.

29:24.048 --> 29:25.115
No, I kind of like
this kind of couch.

29:25.149 --> 29:26.483
No no no no, this is bad.

29:26.517 --> 29:28.485
This is like sitting
on a prison floor.

29:28.519 --> 29:30.220
Which you're very
familiar with, as I recall.

29:30.254 --> 29:32.089
Some people prefer that.

29:32.122 --> 29:33.591
It's a little
stiff, but you know,

29:33.625 --> 29:35.859
a lot of people
prefer that, you know.

29:35.893 --> 29:38.730
- It's a preference.
- You're a preference.

29:38.763 --> 29:40.765
Listen, stop being rude.

29:40.799 --> 29:42.933
- What, come on.
- You're being a jackass.

29:42.966 --> 29:44.902
- Stop it.
- Alright fine.

29:45.836 --> 29:47.504
I gotta whiz.

29:47.538 --> 29:48.606
Where's the ter-let?

29:48.640 --> 29:49.873
It's down in the basement.

29:49.907 --> 29:50.974
- No.
- Just take the escalator

29:51.008 --> 29:52.209
- down there.
- Come on.

29:52.242 --> 29:54.411
Is there an employee
ter-let I can use?

29:54.445 --> 29:55.879
No, not at the moment?

29:55.913 --> 29:57.247
Really, 'cause you were
bringing boys in there

29:57.281 --> 29:58.182
all the time?

29:58.215 --> 29:59.551
You could use the exercise.

30:01.919 --> 30:03.722
Alright, but this
is the couch, baby.

30:03.755 --> 30:04.955
I'm serious.

30:04.988 --> 30:06.123
I've been sitting on
couches my whole life.

30:06.156 --> 30:07.826
I know what I'm
talking about, alright?

30:07.858 --> 30:09.126
Let's, come on.

30:11.629 --> 30:13.130
I'm sorry about that.

30:13.163 --> 30:15.767
I'm still trying to train
him how to act in public,

30:15.800 --> 30:16.967
- and as you can see...
- It's alright.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.737
It's not really
working out very well.

30:18.770 --> 30:20.772
- That's alright.
- You know you get used to it.

30:20.805 --> 30:22.940
- Anyway, yes.
- Well anyway.

30:22.973 --> 30:24.375
This is, you know, I
know you mentioned couch,

30:24.408 --> 30:26.543
- but this is...
- No, I think I like this.

30:26.578 --> 30:27.579
This is cream of the crop.

30:27.612 --> 30:29.046
It's nice and big, it's roomy.

30:29.079 --> 30:31.348
That is cat nap
re-impulse recliner sofa.

30:31.382 --> 30:32.751
- It sounds fancy.
- Kind of.

30:32.784 --> 30:35.085
It's kind of like the
best of both worlds.

30:35.119 --> 30:37.921
Alright, well this comes in
these colors here, alright?

30:37.955 --> 30:40.924
We got this orange, we
got this colonial blue,

30:40.958 --> 30:43.193
we got this pea green, okay.

30:43.227 --> 30:45.864
I don't know, I kind of like...

31:01.445 --> 31:04.114
No, easy buddy.

31:04.148 --> 31:05.082
Easy buddy.

31:06.049 --> 31:08.185
Loving the fashion, huh?

31:08.218 --> 31:09.453
Oh no no no, not scary enough.

31:09.486 --> 31:11.388
Definitely not scary
enough, come on.

31:11.422 --> 31:12.923
What do we got here?

31:12.956 --> 31:14.291
What do we got?

31:14.324 --> 31:15.426
Definitely not
scary enough either.

31:15.459 --> 31:16.661
That would fit you, though.

31:16.694 --> 31:17.928
Sorry man, sorry.

31:17.961 --> 31:19.764
This way, come on.

31:19.798 --> 31:21.532
- Hey, we got nothing.
- What about this?

31:21.566 --> 31:23.066
Oh no no no.

31:23.100 --> 31:24.569
What do you mean?

31:24.602 --> 31:25.770
- I think it's gonna look cute.
- That's not gonna work right?

31:25.804 --> 31:27.171
- Can you see it?
- No.

31:27.204 --> 31:27.971
- That's not gonna fly, right?
- What do you mean?

31:28.005 --> 31:29.406
That's not gonna fly.

31:29.440 --> 31:30.909
Does he look like a little
fairy princess to you?

31:30.941 --> 31:32.710
No, he looks like a big
mean warrior, doesn't he?

31:32.744 --> 31:33.977
I think it'd look cute!

31:34.011 --> 31:35.212
I wonder if this place
has any costumes at all.

31:35.245 --> 31:36.413
I've been looking,
I can't find any.

31:36.447 --> 31:38.015
Oh look, looks
like he works here.

31:38.048 --> 31:39.183
Excuse me, sir.

31:39.216 --> 31:40.685
Excuse me, sir.

31:40.718 --> 31:42.620
Come here for one second.

31:42.654 --> 31:44.521
So we're looking for
Halloween costumes.

31:44.556 --> 31:46.023
All we found was this.

31:46.056 --> 31:47.324
Do you have anything else?

31:47.357 --> 31:48.693
Something a bit
more manly, maybe.

31:48.726 --> 31:51.930
Like you know, for
this guy right here.

31:53.197 --> 31:53.997
Hello?

31:56.935 --> 31:58.502
- It's okay.
- Thanks.

31:59.637 --> 32:01.305
- Come on, let's go.
- We're good, thanks.

32:01.338 --> 32:02.372
Have a good day.

32:02.406 --> 32:03.908
Don't worry about us.

32:03.942 --> 32:04.776
It's okay.

32:05.944 --> 32:08.512
It's okay, you're
okay, it's fine.

32:31.335 --> 32:33.403
Getting some flare-ups.

32:36.273 --> 32:37.207
Oh perfect.

32:45.115 --> 32:47.117
He's not scared at all.

32:49.621 --> 32:54.592
It's easy, dude.

32:55.793 --> 32:57.394
I think he mentioned
something about Yoda.

32:59.229 --> 33:00.531
What?

33:00.565 --> 33:02.634
- I don't see it.
- You good, you good?

33:02.667 --> 33:04.268
You good?

33:04.301 --> 33:06.470
One step at a time.

33:06.503 --> 33:08.505
Natural, he's a natural.

33:09.339 --> 33:10.975
Oh, the Chupacabra!

33:11.009 --> 33:13.778
We caught the Chupacabra!

33:13.811 --> 33:14.646
Come on!

33:24.388 --> 33:25.690
Hello, hi.

33:25.723 --> 33:27.391
This is Ken Glinevich.

33:27.424 --> 33:29.594
I'm calling for Agent Lundquist

33:29.627 --> 33:31.963
about the monster,
I mean, the suspect.

33:31.996 --> 33:33.230
For the reward.

33:35.098 --> 33:35.934
Yeah, no.

33:36.834 --> 33:38.703
Don't put me on hold.

33:38.736 --> 33:40.237
Okay, no I'm okay.

33:41.471 --> 33:43.140
No sir, I'm not drunk.

33:44.441 --> 33:46.443
Agent Lundquist, please.

33:58.990 --> 34:02.526
- Daredevil.
- He wants to go higher.

34:02.560 --> 34:05.162
Put your hands back up there.

34:06.798 --> 34:08.967
Oh no.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.266
Easy buddy.

34:10.300 --> 34:11.668
Whoa.

34:21.110 --> 34:22.045
He just never quits, does he?

34:22.080 --> 34:23.982
No, look at him over there.

34:24.014 --> 34:26.315
I'm loving every minute of this.

34:26.350 --> 34:28.085
He's awesome.

34:28.118 --> 34:31.420
We can't just
keep him forever.

34:31.455 --> 34:34.257
I don't want to
think about that.

34:36.259 --> 34:38.261
I guess my mom could
use the reward money.

34:38.295 --> 34:41.130
Who even knows if there's
actually a reward, Lance?

34:41.164 --> 34:42.498
I mean, something was
fishy about that guy,

34:42.532 --> 34:45.069
and I wouldn't trust him.

34:45.103 --> 34:46.971
I don't know,
I'm just worried.

34:47.005 --> 34:49.107
I mean, what if
Glinevich finds out?

34:49.139 --> 34:51.743
You know, we can
either sit here,

34:51.775 --> 34:54.143
and drive ourselves
absolutely crazy,

34:54.177 --> 34:58.082
worrying about questions we
don't have the answer to,

34:58.116 --> 35:01.284
or we could just
hang out, have fun.

35:01.318 --> 35:04.254
I mean, just live life a little.

35:04.287 --> 35:05.489
Yeah I guess so.

35:05.522 --> 35:07.257
I haven't been this
excited about Halloween

35:07.290 --> 35:09.794
since I was a little kid.

35:09.827 --> 35:11.495
Yeah, me too.

35:11.528 --> 35:12.664
- You're right.
- You know what?

35:12.697 --> 35:13.698
We'll figure it out.

35:13.731 --> 35:15.566
Don't worry, okay?

35:15.600 --> 35:16.433
Okay.

35:17.534 --> 35:19.336
Look at him.

35:19.369 --> 35:21.639
He just can't get enough.

35:21.673 --> 35:23.975
You think he's alright?

35:57.474 --> 36:00.544
How's it going,
Agent Lundquist?

36:00.578 --> 36:02.814
I was under the impression
you'd be coming alone.

36:02.847 --> 36:05.750
Yeah, well this is my
partner, Mr. Van Steed.

36:05.783 --> 36:08.351
Very well, then, have a seat.

36:12.824 --> 36:14.491
So about that 50K.

36:15.560 --> 36:16.460
Patience.

36:17.494 --> 36:18.730
Hi there.

36:18.763 --> 36:20.430
Would you gentlemen like a menu?

36:20.464 --> 36:22.532
We're fine, thank you.

36:22.567 --> 36:24.434
- Gentlemen, eat, please.
- Oh wait wait wait.

36:24.468 --> 36:26.704
Can I get some garlic powder?

36:26.738 --> 36:28.706
I don't do garlic salt.

36:28.740 --> 36:31.109
- Sure thing.
- And some Parmesan cheese.

36:31.142 --> 36:31.976
Sure.

36:33.144 --> 36:35.947
And a side of hot sauce.

36:35.980 --> 36:37.749
- What kind?
- Hot.

36:37.782 --> 36:39.817
Yeah, I meant
like mild or hot.

36:39.851 --> 36:40.685
Hot!

36:41.819 --> 36:42.754
Got ya.

36:42.787 --> 36:44.287
It'll be right up.

36:45.690 --> 36:46.858
Happy?

36:46.891 --> 36:48.559
I will be.

36:48.593 --> 36:50.494
So Mr. Glinevich,

36:50.527 --> 36:53.865
you have knowledge of the
suspect, you've seen him?

36:53.898 --> 36:57.400
We both know that
thing is not human.

36:57.434 --> 36:59.937
- Stay calm, mister...
- Oh I am calm.

36:59.971 --> 37:01.239
And I'll tell you what.

37:01.304 --> 37:02.774
You just tell us how
to get our money,

37:02.807 --> 37:04.075
and we will give you that
little Chupacabra monster,

37:04.108 --> 37:07.979
and we will be on our
way to Isla Moreles.

37:08.012 --> 37:09.847
Do you actually have
it in your possession?

37:09.881 --> 37:11.314
No, but I will.

37:14.185 --> 37:15.019
I promise.

37:15.887 --> 37:17.054
I could do it.

37:20.658 --> 37:21.993
Can I
get you anything else?

37:22.026 --> 37:24.228
No Chupacabra, no money.

37:26.731 --> 37:29.066
Oh, can I get a to-go box?

37:30.333 --> 37:31.401
Sure thing.

37:34.705 --> 37:36.707
You got a pen?

37:36.741 --> 37:37.642
Pardon?

37:37.675 --> 37:39.342
Do you have a pen?

37:47.618 --> 37:48.451
Gracias.

37:51.889 --> 37:54.258
Okay, this is what
I want you to do.

37:54.292 --> 37:56.661
I want you to meet
me at this address.

37:56.694 --> 37:59.297
Thank you, thank you very much.

38:02.667 --> 38:04.101
That was a waste.

38:09.506 --> 38:11.809
Be at that address
tomorrow at midnight.

38:11.843 --> 38:13.678
- I will.
- Okay, okay.

38:23.588 --> 38:28.125
And bring the money, because
no money, no Chupacabra.

38:33.965 --> 38:35.465
Later alligator.

38:39.770 --> 38:41.105
Have a good night.

38:41.138 --> 38:44.709
Oh we will, and Lundquist,
thanks for dinner.

39:23.948 --> 39:24.582
I hear somebody.

39:24.615 --> 39:26.516
Who's out there?

39:27.952 --> 39:29.987
- Hey John.
- Hey, how are you?

39:30.021 --> 39:30.855
- Oh.
- Hi.

39:31.789 --> 39:33.157
Don't do that, you scared me.

39:33.190 --> 39:33.891
- Sorry about that.
- How are you doing?

39:33.925 --> 39:35.159
What's going on?

39:35.192 --> 39:36.761
- How are you?
- Nothing, just hanging out

39:36.794 --> 39:37.995
in the neighborhood.

39:38.029 --> 39:40.831
Okay yeah, I'm just
cooking a little dinner.

39:40.865 --> 39:42.800
Hey, I saw your mom
today down at the store.

39:42.833 --> 39:43.701
- What?
- Yeah,

39:43.734 --> 39:44.769
she's gonna buy a couch.

39:44.802 --> 39:46.337
- Awesome.
- Well almost awesome.

39:46.370 --> 39:47.338
She said she'll be back.

39:47.371 --> 39:48.606
- That's cool.
- Good, yeah.

39:48.639 --> 39:49.607
Yeah almost cool.

39:49.640 --> 39:50.875
She didn't buy it.

39:50.908 --> 39:52.410
You know, she's with
that guy, you know.

39:52.442 --> 39:53.611
So maybe she'll be back.

39:53.644 --> 39:55.947
- Something.
- Yeah, alright guys.

39:55.980 --> 39:57.181
- Wait.
- What?

39:57.214 --> 40:00.017
We have a bit
of a favor to ask.

40:00.051 --> 40:02.219
- Small favor.
- Just a little one.

40:02.253 --> 40:04.288
But you gotta promise
me that you're not

40:04.322 --> 40:06.023
gonna freak out, okay?

40:06.057 --> 40:06.891
Why would I?

40:06.924 --> 40:08.192
Promise, please.

40:08.225 --> 40:11.562
Sure, sure I won't freak out.

40:11.595 --> 40:13.397
- Oh, whoa whoa whoa, no no.
- John, you said you

40:13.431 --> 40:14.298
wouldn't freak out.

40:14.332 --> 40:15.599
Calm down, calm down.

40:15.633 --> 40:16.867
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
- No no no, no.

40:16.901 --> 40:18.069
- Easy, easy, easy.
- No, okay.

40:18.102 --> 40:19.502
He's actually a
really nice guy, John.

40:19.536 --> 40:20.671
He's really sweet,
watch, watch watch watch.

40:20.705 --> 40:21.906
We call him little dude.

40:21.939 --> 40:23.007
- Okay.
- I don't think he likes...

40:23.040 --> 40:24.541
They're looking for him!

40:24.575 --> 40:26.877
50,000 dollars, they're
looking for him.

40:26.911 --> 40:28.346
- No no no.
- Do the trick, do the trick.

40:28.379 --> 40:29.546
- Do the trick, watch watch.
- You have to get it.

40:29.580 --> 40:30.915
You have to get this
little dude out of here.

40:30.948 --> 40:32.482
He loves gum, watch.

40:32.515 --> 40:33.417
- Here, look at this.
- Good, I like gum too.

40:33.451 --> 40:34.885
Really really cute, come on.

40:34.919 --> 40:36.220
- No, you gotta watch.
- Look look, watch watch.

40:36.253 --> 40:37.421
- Just give us two seconds.
- Hey baby.

40:37.455 --> 40:38.990
- Do you want a piece of gum?
- Oh.

40:39.023 --> 40:40.458
You're watching,
you're watching?

40:41.959 --> 40:44.662
- Isn't that cute?
- He's so cute!

40:44.695 --> 40:46.496
Guys, goodnight guys.

40:46.529 --> 40:48.065
- Goodnight, I gotta go.
- John.

40:48.099 --> 40:49.200
- No, no no no, John John.
- No no no no, listen.

40:49.233 --> 40:50.868
- Seriously.
- We really, really,

40:50.901 --> 40:52.203
- really need your help.
- We need your help.

40:52.236 --> 40:53.503
Yeah, okay, what
am I gonna do?

40:53.536 --> 40:54.705
How am I gonna help you?

40:54.739 --> 40:55.973
Let us come
inside John, please.

40:56.007 --> 40:57.375
Please, just...

40:57.408 --> 40:58.809
Glinevich is looking for him.

40:58.843 --> 41:00.945
He could be anywhere
around here.

41:00.978 --> 41:02.246
You gotta call the cops.

41:02.279 --> 41:05.016
You can't take
him in here like...

41:05.049 --> 41:06.183
I don't know.

41:06.217 --> 41:07.517
John, we're
begging you, please.

41:07.551 --> 41:09.787
We have nowhere else to go.

41:12.790 --> 41:14.091
He is kind of cute.

41:14.125 --> 41:15.326
See?

41:15.359 --> 41:17.228
The gum, everything, the
little dude, come on.

41:17.261 --> 41:18.462
- Little dude.
- He's so cute.

41:18.496 --> 41:19.930
Come on, come on come
on come on come on.

41:19.964 --> 41:21.732
- Come on.
- Uncle Johnny's house.

41:21.766 --> 41:24.568
Whoa, no no no,
no, no no no no.

41:24.602 --> 41:25.503
Okay, okay.

41:26.937 --> 41:28.339
- You said okay, right?
- Yeah I said okay, but...

41:28.372 --> 41:29.874
- Okay there we go.
- It's like...

41:29.907 --> 41:31.108
Come on, he's not
gonna hurt you, look.

41:31.142 --> 41:32.476
- It's gonna be fun.
- Johnny's house.

41:32.510 --> 41:34.779
- It's gonna be so much fun.
- Yeah yeah, whoa.

41:34.812 --> 41:36.580
Pretty cool, right?

41:36.614 --> 41:37.782
Look, a chair.

41:38.716 --> 41:39.950
- He likes it.
- He likes it.

41:39.984 --> 41:41.652
- Oh, what's he doing?
- Isn't that cute?

41:41.685 --> 41:43.020
It's just fine,
don't worry about him.

41:43.054 --> 41:43.988
So, what do you think?

41:44.021 --> 41:45.156
You can babysit tomorrow?

41:45.189 --> 41:46.557
- Babysit?
- Yeah.

41:46.590 --> 41:48.192
I mean, I can't take him home.

41:48.225 --> 41:49.260
- My parents would...
- What's he doing

41:49.293 --> 41:50.261
with the light, what's going on?

41:50.294 --> 41:51.495
He's just having a little fun.

41:51.529 --> 41:52.930
- Come on.
- Yeah, he's right at home.

41:52.963 --> 41:54.198
- You can be mad at that.
- Well, you know.

41:54.231 --> 41:55.699
The house has been
kind of lonely.

41:55.733 --> 41:57.134
- So what do you think?
- Maybe I can use a guest.

41:57.168 --> 41:58.402
- Okay, I'll use it...
- Perfect, yeah.

41:58.436 --> 41:59.437
- That sounds great.
- Oh you're the best.

41:59.470 --> 42:00.838
Wait wait wait, ah, wait.

42:00.871 --> 42:02.606
No no, I can't, I can't.

42:02.640 --> 42:04.341
I'm having a Halloween party.

42:04.375 --> 42:06.310
This place is gonna be packed.

42:06.343 --> 42:08.479
No no no no, no.

42:08.512 --> 42:09.814
No, stay away from
there, stay away.

42:09.847 --> 42:11.315
- Hey, don't.
- It's okay, it's fine.

42:11.348 --> 42:12.950
No but it's fine
'cause we're gonna be,

42:12.983 --> 42:14.485
we're gonna go
trick-or-treating with him.

42:14.518 --> 42:15.653
Yeah, okay, alright.

42:15.686 --> 42:16.620
- Though, what do I do with him?
- Stop.

42:16.654 --> 42:18.155
What?

42:18.189 --> 42:19.890
It's not too hard.

42:19.924 --> 42:22.126
I mean, he doesn't eat, right?

42:22.159 --> 42:24.161
- He doesn't eat, okay.
- He doesn't sleep.

42:24.195 --> 42:25.429
That's really it.

42:25.463 --> 42:27.064
All you have to
do is pretty much

42:27.098 --> 42:28.332
not let him out of the house.

42:28.365 --> 42:29.266
I mean, that's it, right?

42:29.300 --> 42:30.801
And you can't tell anyone.

42:30.835 --> 42:32.269
This has to stay between us.

42:32.303 --> 42:34.839
- And no one can know, John.
- What would they want

42:34.872 --> 42:36.740
with a cute little guy
like this, anyways, huh?

42:36.774 --> 42:39.210
He's so harmless,
I mean, look at him.

42:39.243 --> 42:41.078
Yeah, you know.

42:41.112 --> 42:43.080
Come on, he likes you.

42:43.114 --> 42:44.715
- You can tell.
- Does he have a name?

42:44.748 --> 42:45.916
Not yet, no.

42:47.118 --> 42:48.419
- Not yet.
- How about Gary?

42:48.452 --> 42:50.121
Yeah, you like Gary?

42:51.088 --> 42:53.224
- No.
- No, no no no.

42:53.257 --> 42:54.525
- Thanks so much John.
- We'll figure

42:54.559 --> 42:55.960
- it out later.
- You're a lifesaver.

42:55.993 --> 42:57.428
- You're the man.
- You don't even realize.

42:57.461 --> 42:58.662
You're gonna love
hanging out with this guy.

42:58.696 --> 42:59.630
- Right baby?
- Look.

42:59.663 --> 43:01.098
Be good for Uncle John.

43:02.366 --> 43:03.334
- It's gonna be great.
- See, he's so cute.

43:03.367 --> 43:04.603
You two are gonna bond.

43:04.635 --> 43:05.870
- He's the son you never had.
- Have fun.

43:05.903 --> 43:06.770
Right?

43:06.804 --> 43:07.838
- Enjoy.
- Yeah, yeah.

43:07.872 --> 43:09.340
Thank you, you're a lifesaver.

43:09.373 --> 43:10.441
Remember, don't let him
out of the house, okay?

43:10.474 --> 43:12.009
- See you little dude!
- Alright.

43:12.042 --> 43:13.377
Have a fun time!

43:18.415 --> 43:19.416
Oh my God.

43:52.149 --> 43:53.317
You like that?

43:57.288 --> 43:58.088
Yeah.

43:59.423 --> 44:00.691
That's Buster.

44:00.724 --> 44:02.159
Buster.

44:02.193 --> 44:04.762
And the little pink
one, that's Calamity Jane.

44:04.795 --> 44:07.698
Right, and that's
Kermit back there.

44:07.731 --> 44:10.034
He's not green, though.

44:10.067 --> 44:12.503
But the multicolor one,
that's my favorite.

44:12.536 --> 44:13.771
Pistol Pete.

44:13.804 --> 44:14.738
Oh, Pete.

44:16.106 --> 44:17.775
Yeah, Pistol Pete.

44:26.551 --> 44:29.520
Next time, we'll feed them.

44:29.554 --> 44:30.387
Yeah.

44:39.564 --> 44:41.031
That's right.

44:41.065 --> 44:41.899
Yeah.

44:59.718 --> 45:02.453
- Hey!
- Oh Jesus Christ Glinevich.

45:02.486 --> 45:04.288
- What the hell?
- Hey princess.

45:04.321 --> 45:05.222
- What are you doing?
- Come on!

45:05.256 --> 45:06.591
What are you doing man?

45:06.625 --> 45:08.025
I wanted to see the princess.

45:08.058 --> 45:09.661
- Give me the towel.
- Whoa, hey, take it easy.

45:09.694 --> 45:10.928
- Take it easy.
- Hand me the towel.

45:10.961 --> 45:12.631
Give me the towel.

45:12.664 --> 45:14.365
Oh, you're a tough
guy all of a sudden.

45:14.398 --> 45:15.532
Give me the towel, Glinevich!

45:15.567 --> 45:16.735
- Let me see your shmig.
- Don't be a dick!

45:16.767 --> 45:18.902
Alright, take
the freaking towel.

45:18.936 --> 45:20.404
- Princess, relax.
- What are you doing?

45:20.437 --> 45:22.574
This is how we do things.
This is how men do things.

45:22.607 --> 45:23.742
This is not how men do things.

45:23.774 --> 45:24.775
And why is he in the corner?

45:24.808 --> 45:26.578
Because we wanted to say hi.

45:26.611 --> 45:27.845
Now while we're here,

45:27.878 --> 45:29.614
why don't you tell us
where the monster is?

45:29.648 --> 45:30.948
What monster?

45:30.981 --> 45:32.916
Huh, tell me where
the monster is.

45:32.950 --> 45:34.084
What are you talking about?

45:34.118 --> 45:35.019
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

45:35.052 --> 45:37.488
Tell me where the Chupacabra is.

45:37.521 --> 45:39.523
Glinevich, I don't know
what you're talking about.

45:39.557 --> 45:43.994
I saw you in the store
with the Chupacabra.

45:44.028 --> 45:45.095
- I don't know what you're...
- I saw you

45:45.129 --> 45:46.063
and your little girlfriend.

45:46.096 --> 45:47.766
I saw you guys, I saw you.

45:47.798 --> 45:49.967
- No you didn't.
- Oh, just you and her.

45:50.000 --> 45:50.901
You like her?

45:50.934 --> 45:51.835
Don't talk about Truth, man.

45:51.869 --> 45:53.170
Oh, is that her name, Truth?

45:53.203 --> 45:54.438
- That's her name.
- Yeah?

45:54.471 --> 45:55.239
You know what I'd
like to do to her?

45:55.272 --> 45:56.440
Don't start.

45:56.473 --> 45:57.676
I don't know what
you're talking about!

45:57.709 --> 45:59.176
Talk to me! Tell
me tell me tell me.

45:59.209 --> 46:01.078
I saw you, I saw
you, and I saw that

46:01.111 --> 46:02.279
little girlfriend of yours,

46:02.313 --> 46:03.615
and I saw you at
the fucking, oh!

46:03.648 --> 46:04.683
I don't know what
you're talking about.

46:04.716 --> 46:05.784
Look what you're doing to me.

46:05.816 --> 46:06.950
Look what you're doing to me.

46:06.984 --> 46:08.152
- Oh yeah?
- Tell me.

46:08.185 --> 46:09.420
See what my mom has
to say about that.

46:09.453 --> 46:11.455
Hey hey hey hey
hey, hey, come on.

46:11.488 --> 46:12.657
Mom, oh mom!

46:15.125 --> 46:16.628
Come on.

46:16.661 --> 46:17.895
What?

46:17.928 --> 46:19.830
Your boyfriend and his
little weirdo boyfriend

46:19.863 --> 46:23.100
were just in the shower
on me, just came in.

46:23.133 --> 46:24.935
- Ken?
- Yeah, with them.

46:24.968 --> 46:26.170
Hey baby.

46:26.203 --> 46:27.237
Weirdos next door.

46:27.271 --> 46:29.139
Look at 'em, right here.

46:29.173 --> 46:30.908
- What are you doing up here?
- Hey sweetie, hey baby.

46:30.941 --> 46:33.812
- Caught red-handed.
- What are you...

46:33.844 --> 46:35.179
I told him I
wasn't interested,

46:35.212 --> 46:37.414
but he kept on pressing.

46:37.448 --> 46:39.617
Something about KY
jelly and a garden hose.

46:39.651 --> 46:41.686
- What?
- Hey, how are you?

46:41.720 --> 46:42.587
Looking good.

46:42.620 --> 46:44.021
You look good tonight.

46:44.054 --> 46:44.955
- What are you doing here?
- I was just coming,

46:44.988 --> 46:46.156
I was talking to the princess,

46:46.190 --> 46:47.759
and we were just
chiming it up like guys.

46:47.792 --> 46:49.159
Okay, you were
talking to my son

46:49.193 --> 46:50.427
- while he was in the shower?
- Yes, I was talking

46:50.461 --> 46:51.563
to him in the shower.

46:51.596 --> 46:53.263
Why are you bothering my son?

46:53.297 --> 46:54.398
I'm just talking to your son.

46:54.431 --> 46:55.800
- I just wanted to talk...
- In the shower?

46:55.834 --> 46:57.334
Yes, he was in the
shower, so I talked to him.

46:57.368 --> 46:58.268
What is wrong with you?

46:58.302 --> 46:59.771
What is wrong with you?

46:59.804 --> 47:02.039
- Absolutely nothing.
- Okay!

47:02.072 --> 47:04.541
He's got something I need!

47:04.576 --> 47:05.777
That's all I'm saying,

47:05.810 --> 47:07.111
I'm just asking
him for something,

47:07.144 --> 47:08.379
- and he won't give it to me.
- I have no idea

47:08.412 --> 47:09.814
- what he's talking about.
- That's all, I'm sorry.

47:09.848 --> 47:11.115
- What's wrong with you?
- I was in the Navy with guys.

47:11.148 --> 47:13.183
- We did that stuff.
- No guys don't do that stuff.

47:13.217 --> 47:14.418
- Yes, well, they do.
- Guess what?

47:14.451 --> 47:16.788
Guys don't do that
stuff to my son.

47:16.821 --> 47:17.988
- Oh really?
- Yes.

47:18.021 --> 47:19.256
But know that
your son is a liar,

47:19.289 --> 47:21.593
so maybe they should
do that stuff to him!

47:21.626 --> 47:22.960
Look at him, he's insane.

47:22.993 --> 47:24.395
- Look, I am not.
- Look at his eyes.

47:24.428 --> 47:26.163
- Let me just explain.
- Calm down.

47:26.196 --> 47:27.799
I'm calm, okay?

47:27.832 --> 47:29.032
Here's the thing.

47:29.066 --> 47:31.836
Your son knows where I
can get 50,000 dollars.

47:31.870 --> 47:33.337
There's a little
Chupacabra monster.

47:33.370 --> 47:34.572
- I have no idea.
- I'm trying to just

47:34.606 --> 47:35.807
get him to tell me where it is,

47:35.840 --> 47:37.107
but he won't tell
me where it is,

47:37.141 --> 47:38.208
and that's all I want to know.

47:38.242 --> 47:39.744
Ask him, you ask
him where it is.

47:39.778 --> 47:41.078
I won't, I just want to know

47:41.111 --> 47:42.546
- where it is.
- You are out of your mind.

47:42.580 --> 47:43.815
Why don't you ask him
what he plans to do with it?

47:43.848 --> 47:45.082
He's gonna give
me 50,000 dollars,

47:45.115 --> 47:46.383
and I just gotta get this thing,

47:46.417 --> 47:47.852
- and he knows where it is.
- No I don't.

47:47.886 --> 47:49.353
And I'm just trying to get him

47:49.386 --> 47:51.155
to tell me where it is, and
he's lying to me about it.

47:51.188 --> 47:53.090
- Why are you lying?
- Why don't you tell her,

47:53.123 --> 47:55.459
why don't you tell her about
your Isla Moreles plans

47:55.492 --> 47:57.862
after you've gained
this 50,000 dollar?

47:57.896 --> 47:59.496
- What, what?
- Right right right!

47:59.530 --> 48:00.931
- Look at him!
- What?

48:00.964 --> 48:02.266
- Just lying through his...
- I'm not lying!

48:02.299 --> 48:04.268
- Don't get near him!
- Come on, watch.

48:04.301 --> 48:05.135
Alright.

48:06.370 --> 48:08.673
- Get out of my house.
- Get out.

48:08.706 --> 48:09.874
- No.
- You,

48:09.908 --> 48:11.475
and your creepy little
friend over there.

48:11.508 --> 48:13.778
Don't even try to touch me.

48:15.212 --> 48:17.448
- Get out, now.
- You go, mom.

48:19.551 --> 48:20.685
- And don't you ever...
- I swear to God.

48:20.718 --> 48:23.353
Don't you go
near my son again.

48:24.823 --> 48:26.256
- Alright.
- Do you understand?

48:26.290 --> 48:27.725
You know what?

48:27.759 --> 48:29.661
I don't hit women. That's
the kind of guy I am.

48:29.694 --> 48:30.795
That's the kind
of guy you moved...

48:30.829 --> 48:32.262
Oh, you're a stand-up guy.

48:32.296 --> 48:33.497
- Good for you.
- Yeah.

48:33.530 --> 48:34.599
Stand
up guy, Glinevich.

48:34.632 --> 48:35.800
Get the hell out.

48:35.834 --> 48:36.801
Come on, baby,
don't be like that.

48:36.835 --> 48:37.936
- Don't baby me.
- Don't baby me.

48:37.968 --> 48:39.136
- You know, come on.
- Get out!

48:39.169 --> 48:40.404
- Hey.
- Get out of my house now!

48:40.437 --> 48:41.873
- Whoa, whoa!
- Now!

48:41.906 --> 48:45.577
Whoa, okay okay
okay, take it easy.

48:45.610 --> 48:47.277
- You go mom.
- What's the matter with you?

48:47.311 --> 48:48.813
- And you, go.
- Come on.

48:48.847 --> 48:50.314
- We're leaving.
- Get your creepy

48:50.347 --> 48:52.316
- little mustache out of here.
- We're leaving.

48:52.349 --> 48:53.685
- Goodbye.
- I might die

48:53.718 --> 48:55.419
- in the street tonight.
- I don't care.

48:55.452 --> 48:56.654
- Come here!
- We'd be so lucky.

48:56.688 --> 48:57.988
- Don't go near him!
- I swear to God!

48:58.021 --> 48:59.456
- I told you!
- Alright alright alright.

48:59.490 --> 49:01.693
Don't go near him.

49:01.726 --> 49:02.927
We're out of here.

49:02.961 --> 49:04.461
You're a bitch, and
your son is an idiot.

49:04.495 --> 49:06.063
Guess what, now
I'm a single bitch.

49:06.096 --> 49:07.264
He's a liar!

49:07.297 --> 49:10.100
Let's go have incest
with each other.

49:11.435 --> 49:12.436
I've been telling you.

49:12.469 --> 49:15.138
Do you finally understand?

49:15.172 --> 49:16.173
I'm sorry.

49:19.409 --> 49:20.645
Unbelievable.

49:21.579 --> 49:22.647
Party's over.

49:23.480 --> 49:25.415
Un-freaking-believable.

49:27.017 --> 49:29.152
Hey, okay, alright, alright.

49:29.186 --> 49:31.221
I'm sorry, are you okay?

49:31.255 --> 49:32.155
I'm okay.

49:33.691 --> 49:35.359
I'm trying.

49:35.392 --> 49:37.227
I am, I'm trying
as hard as I can.

49:37.261 --> 49:39.096
I know you are, mom.

49:58.181 --> 49:59.684
I'm leaving now!

50:27.110 --> 50:29.546
Be right back, little Gary.

50:57.809 --> 50:59.476
- Hi, John, hi.
- Hi.

50:59.509 --> 51:01.378
Look what I got!

51:01.411 --> 51:02.412
Thank you.

51:03.413 --> 51:05.349
But you didn't have to do that.

51:05.382 --> 51:07.484
Did you just hear all that?

51:07.517 --> 51:09.587
I heard something, but,

51:10.688 --> 51:12.790
you don't want to go inside?

51:12.824 --> 51:14.157
It's cold out, let's go inside.

51:14.191 --> 51:17.494
No, the hot chocolate
will keep us warm.

51:17.527 --> 51:18.896
I need to clear my head.

51:18.930 --> 51:20.598
Fresh air will help.

51:23.400 --> 51:24.969
- Smells good.
- Sure.

51:33.811 --> 51:35.013
So what's your deal?

51:35.046 --> 51:38.783
Are you married, have
a girlfriend, any kids?

51:40.885 --> 51:42.820
I was married.

51:42.854 --> 51:45.489
- What happened?
- I knew something was weird

51:45.522 --> 51:47.025
when she was going
to the chiropractor

51:47.058 --> 51:49.627
like every other day. And
then I knew it was over when

51:49.661 --> 51:52.130
he started making house calls.

51:53.230 --> 51:56.000
Yikes, that's not good.

51:56.034 --> 51:57.935
I always wanted kids.

51:57.969 --> 52:00.170
I'd be a good father.

52:00.203 --> 52:04.842
You know, it's not all
it's cracked up to be.

52:04.876 --> 52:08.478
You get this vision in
your head, you know,

52:09.346 --> 52:11.883
of how you think it should be.

52:11.916 --> 52:13.517
And then your husband
leaves with a waitress,

52:13.551 --> 52:17.755
and that vision and all
those ideas that you had,

52:17.789 --> 52:19.389
they just, they go.

52:23.728 --> 52:24.896
I'm sorry about that.

52:24.929 --> 52:26.329
Don't be sorry.

52:26.363 --> 52:28.966
He was a jerk, and so was Ken.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.234
So I'm better off.

52:31.268 --> 52:32.269
I'm sorry.

52:33.705 --> 52:36.339
Hey, why are we
talking about this?

52:36.373 --> 52:37.942
I should be inviting you
to the Halloween party.

52:37.975 --> 52:39.443
I throw a big Halloween party.

52:39.476 --> 52:42.080
Everybody comes,
the whole block.

52:42.113 --> 52:44.682
This house, it gets packed.

52:44.716 --> 52:46.516
Oh yeah, I'm gonna decorate it.

52:46.551 --> 52:48.553
I mean, you want to come?

52:48.586 --> 52:50.688
Oh God, do I have
to wear a costume?

52:50.722 --> 52:53.356
Well, yeah, I mean,
no, you don't have...

52:53.390 --> 52:55.525
But if you don't, you know,

52:55.560 --> 52:56.894
people are gonna look
at you kind of funny.

52:56.928 --> 52:58.528
Ugh.

52:58.563 --> 53:00.064
I could help you with a costume.
I got a lot of costumes.

53:00.098 --> 53:01.933
I don't think I've
worn a Halloween costume

53:01.966 --> 53:04.936
- in like 20 years.
- 20 years?

53:04.969 --> 53:06.536
Yeah, it's been a long time.

53:06.571 --> 53:08.673
Well you don't know
what you've been missing.

53:08.706 --> 53:10.108
Hm.

53:10.141 --> 53:12.143
What do you say?

53:12.176 --> 53:13.611
You know what?

53:13.644 --> 53:14.779
I'll go.

53:14.812 --> 53:15.646
It sounds like fun.

53:15.680 --> 53:16.513
Alright.

53:19.249 --> 53:20.084
Cool.

53:36.968 --> 53:37.969
Okay okay.

53:39.203 --> 53:41.172
Here I come.

53:41.205 --> 53:43.608
Calm down, little guy.

53:43.641 --> 53:44.809
- How was it?
- Hey.

53:44.842 --> 53:46.077
- Hey buddy, hey.
- Hi guys.

53:46.110 --> 53:47.712
Hi baby.

53:47.745 --> 53:49.714
Did you have fun
with Uncle John?

53:49.747 --> 53:51.115
How did everything go,
how did everything go?

53:51.149 --> 53:52.382
Good, more or less.

53:52.415 --> 53:53.584
He wasn't too much
of a hassle, was he?

53:53.618 --> 53:54.619
- No.
- A lot of energy.

53:54.652 --> 53:57.789
- Yeah, yeah he does.
- Great.

53:57.822 --> 53:58.890
This sucks.

54:00.357 --> 54:01.759
I wish I had a real costume.

54:01.793 --> 54:03.493
What do you mean?

54:03.527 --> 54:04.762
I think you look cute.

54:04.796 --> 54:08.465
Exactly.

54:09.600 --> 54:11.468
- Hey buddy.
- Yeah, you like that?

54:11.501 --> 54:12.603
What you doing?

54:12.637 --> 54:13.470
Cool, huh?

54:14.605 --> 54:16.373
Hey, I have a
date coming tonight.

54:16.406 --> 54:17.842
Really, wow.

54:17.875 --> 54:18.776
A date?

54:18.810 --> 54:20.011
Good for you, John.

54:20.044 --> 54:21.846
Yeah, I was talking
to Kim last night.

54:21.879 --> 54:22.847
Kim?

54:22.880 --> 54:24.682
Yeah, Lance's mom.

54:24.715 --> 54:26.184
I think she likes me.

54:26.217 --> 54:27.450
Who knows?

54:27.484 --> 54:31.055
We might be bumping
uglies tonight.

54:31.088 --> 54:32.623
What?

54:32.657 --> 54:34.491
What did you just say?

54:37.394 --> 54:40.298
- Just a few words.
- What does that even mean?

54:40.330 --> 54:41.531
Combination.

54:41.566 --> 54:42.465
Like from the
60s or something?

54:42.499 --> 54:44.735
It's just, you look great.

54:49.807 --> 54:51.541
Alright baby, you ready?

54:51.576 --> 54:54.579
I'm gonna get your
costume on now, okay?

54:54.612 --> 54:57.014
Okay, now just stand still.

54:57.048 --> 54:58.348
Oh wait, what's the matter?

54:58.381 --> 54:59.817
What's the matter?

54:59.851 --> 55:01.118
- It'll just be a second.
- You're good, you're okay.

55:01.152 --> 55:03.087
Come on, just stand still.

55:03.120 --> 55:05.122
It's gonna look so cool.

55:06.557 --> 55:08.059
It's not the same cloth
from the attic, you're okay.

55:08.092 --> 55:11.262
Ah, where are your,
oh, there we go.

55:12.563 --> 55:14.765
- There they are.
- Looks so good.

55:14.799 --> 55:15.633
Cute!

55:18.135 --> 55:20.805
Have fun guys, be safe.

55:25.943 --> 55:27.979
Come on little dude.

55:28.012 --> 55:30.181
All the trick-or-treaters.

55:32.482 --> 55:34.085
Pretty cool, right?

55:49.767 --> 55:52.036
Coming up to the first house.

55:52.069 --> 55:53.905
You having fun, buddy?

56:04.582 --> 56:06.416
What did you forget?

56:08.119 --> 56:09.587
Oh, did I forget what?

56:09.620 --> 56:10.453
Nothing.

56:11.923 --> 56:12.990
Wow.

56:13.024 --> 56:13.925
You like?

56:14.825 --> 56:16.193
It's good.

56:16.227 --> 56:18.596
Good, yeah, it looks good.

56:18.629 --> 56:20.564
Why thank you, Count.

56:22.033 --> 56:23.401
Oh.

56:23.433 --> 56:25.136
- Am I early?
- Just a little.

56:25.169 --> 56:26.904
- I'm sorry.
- Would you like a drink?

56:26.938 --> 56:28.039
Oh, thank you.

56:28.072 --> 56:29.740
That would be great.

56:43.587 --> 56:44.855
There you go.

56:53.496 --> 56:56.100
Little buddy, don't get scared.

57:02.640 --> 57:04.541
What do you have there?

57:04.575 --> 57:07.311
It's a special
Halloween drink.

57:10.614 --> 57:13.451
It's called a morgue-arita.

57:13.483 --> 57:16.620
Ooh, spooky.

57:16.654 --> 57:19.090
You love Halloween, don't you?

57:19.123 --> 57:20.024
Oh, yeah.

57:22.893 --> 57:25.196
Mm, that's really good.

57:25.229 --> 57:27.131
Yeah, I got it out
of some magazine.

57:27.164 --> 57:28.265
- Yeah?
- Ooh.

57:39.276 --> 57:41.379
- It's good, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

57:41.412 --> 57:42.847
Very good, thank you.

57:42.880 --> 57:46.584
- I'm sorry I came so early.
- Should be here soon.

57:49.787 --> 57:52.857
Hey little dude,
come on, buddy.

57:52.890 --> 57:54.058
First house.

57:56.127 --> 58:00.664
- Come on, don't be scared.
- It's a big deal.

58:00.698 --> 58:01.966
Alright buddy?

58:03.067 --> 58:05.002
Oh yeah, there he is.

58:06.871 --> 58:09.407
One step at a
time, you got this.

58:09.440 --> 58:10.508
- Come on buddy.
- Hi.

58:10.574 --> 58:11.776
- Hello.
- Hello there.

58:11.809 --> 58:12.576
- Trick or treat.
- Trick or treat.

58:12.610 --> 58:13.811
It's his first time.

58:13.844 --> 58:14.879
- He's a little nervous.
- He's a little nervous.

58:14.912 --> 58:16.847
Trick or treat.

58:16.881 --> 58:18.215
Ready, want it,
we'll do it again.

58:18.249 --> 58:19.483
Ready, one two three.

58:19.517 --> 58:20.918
Trick or treat.

58:20.951 --> 58:21.919
See how it works, look.

58:23.354 --> 58:25.189
- There you go.
- Yeah, there you go.

58:25.222 --> 58:27.124
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

58:27.158 --> 58:30.928
We're going to Isla
Moreles, my friend.

58:30.961 --> 58:32.897
You got a nice place.

58:33.898 --> 58:35.399
Yeah.

58:35.433 --> 58:37.101
Got a fish over there.

58:37.134 --> 58:38.736
Just got some new ones.

58:38.769 --> 58:40.404
Oh, and I see you cooked.

58:40.438 --> 58:42.106
You've been slaving all day.

58:42.139 --> 58:44.408
Well, yeah.

58:44.442 --> 58:47.044
Cold cuts, I cook
them all the time.

58:47.078 --> 58:50.147
I could tell, very
nice, very nice.

58:51.248 --> 58:53.784
Hey, want to play a game?

58:53.818 --> 58:55.186
Not really.

58:55.219 --> 58:57.221
Oh, you're gonna
love this game.

58:57.254 --> 58:58.456
You want to play?

58:58.489 --> 58:59.590
Not really.

59:01.792 --> 59:03.461
Okay, we'll eat
more carrots then.

59:03.494 --> 59:04.563
Okay, we'll play a game.

59:04.595 --> 59:05.596
Okay cool.

59:06.497 --> 59:08.766
Do we really need a blindfold?

59:08.799 --> 59:10.768
It's Halloween,
this is a tradition.

59:10.801 --> 59:12.470
- Now if you're scared...
- I'm not scared.

59:12.503 --> 59:13.971
- Oh, you're scared.
- I trust you.

59:14.004 --> 59:15.106
- No we don't have, okay.
- I trust you, let's go.

59:15.139 --> 59:15.973
Alright.

59:18.742 --> 59:21.612
- Someone's scared.
- I'm not scared.

59:21.645 --> 59:22.980
- Your hair is shaking.
- As long as nothing

59:23.013 --> 59:24.515
bites me I'm good.

59:25.749 --> 59:26.784
- How's that?
- You're not gonna

59:26.817 --> 59:27.718
- bite me, are you?
- Good.

59:27.751 --> 59:28.886
And let me see if you can see.

59:28.919 --> 59:30.154
Okay, I'm gonna punch
you in the face.

59:30.187 --> 59:31.355
- Get out.
- And see if like...

59:51.308 --> 59:52.577
You alright?

59:52.611 --> 59:53.844
Here we go.

59:58.716 --> 01:00:01.652
- Trick or treat.
- Oh, come on in.

01:00:01.685 --> 01:00:03.387
Oh, you just stay there.

01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:05.156
You're in safe hands.

01:00:05.189 --> 01:00:07.958
Maybe.

01:00:12.196 --> 01:00:13.464
Into the living room.

01:00:13.497 --> 01:00:16.433
- Yes, please.
- Okay come on little dude.

01:00:17.935 --> 01:00:19.036
Well aren't you just
the cutest little monster.

01:00:19.069 --> 01:00:19.937
Great, isn't he?

01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:21.172
So?

01:00:21.205 --> 01:00:23.874
Trick or treat!

01:00:23.908 --> 01:00:25.476
Grab your hand.

01:00:25.509 --> 01:00:29.280
Oh, your hands are extra
soft for Halloween.

01:00:29.313 --> 01:00:30.381
What is that?

01:00:30.414 --> 01:00:31.749
It's freezing.

01:00:33.384 --> 01:00:35.186
What it is, it's
a part of the body.

01:00:35.219 --> 01:00:36.453
Part of the body?

01:00:36.487 --> 01:00:37.521
Yeah, part.

01:00:37.556 --> 01:00:38.756
Is it brains?

01:00:39.957 --> 01:00:41.425
Yes it is, okay.

01:00:42.459 --> 01:00:43.562
Let's try the next one.

01:00:43.595 --> 01:00:44.395
So.

01:00:45.763 --> 01:00:47.998
Trick or treat.

01:00:48.032 --> 01:00:49.200
No, no no.

01:00:49.233 --> 01:00:52.369
This is the part
where you sing a song,

01:00:52.403 --> 01:00:55.139
or tell a joke, or
just do something

01:00:55.172 --> 01:00:57.975
to make me want
to give you candy.

01:00:59.176 --> 01:01:01.312
Old school huh, okay.

01:01:01.345 --> 01:01:02.880
What's that one?

01:01:02.913 --> 01:01:05.482
What is that?

01:01:05.516 --> 01:01:07.751
- I don't know.
- Part of the body.

01:01:07.785 --> 01:01:11.121
- Part of the body.
- What is that?

01:01:11.155 --> 01:01:13.157
On Halloween night, ooh.

01:01:14.258 --> 01:01:16.561
It's, intestines.

01:01:16.595 --> 01:01:17.428
Yes!

01:01:20.197 --> 01:01:23.367
Trick or
treat, smell my feet.

01:01:24.501 --> 01:01:27.004
Give me something good to eat.

01:01:29.406 --> 01:01:30.908
He's a little, you know.

01:01:30.941 --> 01:01:32.209
We need more.

01:01:34.378 --> 01:01:36.046
Which one is that?

01:01:39.584 --> 01:01:41.418
This one is a grape.

01:01:44.922 --> 01:01:47.324
Yeah, eyeball, grape, yeah.

01:01:48.392 --> 01:01:49.260
I'm good.

01:01:50.194 --> 01:01:52.997
What do I win?

01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:54.832
Well, we've got cold cuts.

01:01:54.865 --> 01:01:56.767
I'll take it.

01:02:00.871 --> 01:02:02.840
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

01:02:02.873 --> 01:02:04.808
- That's okay.
- You know, I just...

01:02:04.842 --> 01:02:05.843
It's alright.

01:02:05.876 --> 01:02:07.244
Anyway, let me put these away.

01:02:07.278 --> 01:02:09.346
- Okay.
- So how was that?

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:10.814
- It was okay.
- You're very good at this,

01:02:10.848 --> 01:02:11.982
for the fist time
ever playing that.

01:02:12.016 --> 01:02:13.017
It's okay.

01:02:20.224 --> 01:02:21.726
Oh, there we go.

01:02:22.627 --> 01:02:23.894
You earned it buddy.

01:02:23.927 --> 01:02:27.064
- You earned it.
- It wasn't that bad, right?

01:02:34.271 --> 01:02:35.674
Apples, really?

01:02:37.041 --> 01:02:38.842
I mean, don't you have lollipops
in there, and everything?

01:02:38.876 --> 01:02:41.178
No, apples, apples
are wonderful.

01:02:41.211 --> 01:02:43.480
- Chocolate...
- Apples are your friend.

01:02:43.514 --> 01:02:45.617
- No.
- They have vitamins

01:02:47.184 --> 01:02:50.954
and minerals, lots of
fiber to help you poop.

01:02:54.825 --> 01:02:55.627
Poop?

01:02:58.862 --> 01:03:00.230
Thanks.

01:03:00.264 --> 01:03:02.166
- Okay we should probably...
- Happy Halloween.

01:03:02.199 --> 01:03:04.234
- Happy Halloween.
- Treat, treat!

01:03:04.268 --> 01:03:06.805
We want to go, we want
to go. Come on, no no no.

01:03:21.619 --> 01:03:22.821
There they are, oh yeah.

01:03:22.853 --> 01:03:24.288
This is it.

01:03:24.321 --> 01:03:25.790
Let's do it.

01:03:25.824 --> 01:03:27.424
Hey, princess.

01:03:27.458 --> 01:03:29.927
Stop right there,
nobody gets hurt.

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.228
- Take it easy.
- Run, run!

01:03:31.261 --> 01:03:32.597
Come here, come here!

01:03:34.064 --> 01:03:35.366
- Hey stop, no no no.
- Princess get out of here.

01:03:35.399 --> 01:03:38.770
- I'm gonna get you!
- Run don't look back!

01:03:39.903 --> 01:03:41.238
Get back here.

01:03:42.172 --> 01:03:43.775
Stop, stop!

01:03:43.808 --> 01:03:44.843
Come on!

01:03:44.908 --> 01:03:46.343
Run baby, run!

01:03:46.377 --> 01:03:48.045
Run, faster!

01:03:48.078 --> 01:03:49.146
Hey!

01:03:52.282 --> 01:03:53.618
Where'd he go?

01:03:54.485 --> 01:03:55.653
Run little dude, run!

01:03:55.687 --> 01:03:57.988
Glinevich, Glinevich!

01:03:58.021 --> 01:04:00.924
Well thank you for a
lovely Halloween party.

01:04:00.958 --> 01:04:02.292
- Well thank you.
- I did not want to come,

01:04:02.326 --> 01:04:04.061
and I had a great time.

01:04:04.094 --> 01:04:05.597
- I'm having a great time.
- Me too.

01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:07.131
I'm glad you came.

01:04:08.465 --> 01:04:10.300
These are delicious.

01:04:11.902 --> 01:04:13.504
Is it?

01:04:13.537 --> 01:04:15.973
I think it's the same, but...

01:04:24.148 --> 01:04:26.383
Come back here, come
back here, come back here.

01:04:26.417 --> 01:04:29.621
That's it, that's it, that's it.

01:04:29.654 --> 01:04:31.288
Oh, we have more party guests.

01:04:31.321 --> 01:04:33.357
That's it, that's it,
that's it, that's it!

01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:34.224
Oh, oh oh.

01:04:36.393 --> 01:04:38.262
Can't get in.

01:04:38.295 --> 01:04:40.230
Oh my God, Ken?

01:04:40.264 --> 01:04:42.032
- Hey babe.
- What are you doing here?

01:04:42.065 --> 01:04:43.066
What's going on?

01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:44.535
- Hey, hey hey.
- Come here!

01:04:44.569 --> 01:04:46.738
- Hey, no!
- Come here now!

01:04:48.338 --> 01:04:49.940
Get out of the way!

01:04:55.713 --> 01:04:57.948
Got ya, you little monster.

01:05:02.821 --> 01:05:05.657
Come on come on
come on come on.

01:05:07.859 --> 01:05:10.895
Oh yeah, come here
you little Chupacabra.

01:05:10.929 --> 01:05:13.430
Settle down, boy, settle down.

01:05:14.531 --> 01:05:16.233
Settle down, settle down.

01:05:16.266 --> 01:05:17.802
- Don't you bite me.
- Little dude, come on!

01:05:17.836 --> 01:05:18.803
Dude!

01:05:18.837 --> 01:05:19.704
What are you doing here?

01:05:19.737 --> 01:05:22.239
Ow!

01:05:33.183 --> 01:05:34.251
Freaking kid.

01:05:36.688 --> 01:05:39.557
Ken, what are you doing here?

01:05:39.591 --> 01:05:40.825
What are you doing here?

01:05:40.859 --> 01:05:42.192
What am I doing?

01:05:42.226 --> 01:05:43.728
- What am I doing here?
- Yes!

01:05:43.761 --> 01:05:45.062
What are you doing here?

01:05:45.095 --> 01:05:47.799
- That's it, I'm done.
- What is that?

01:05:47.832 --> 01:05:49.032
Come here, come here!

01:05:49.066 --> 01:05:50.234
- What are you talking about?
- Come here!

01:05:50.267 --> 01:05:50.902
- You see this?
- Are you serious?

01:05:50.935 --> 01:05:52.135
Bye to mommy.

01:05:52.169 --> 01:05:53.437
Mommy comes with me.

01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:54.906
Are you doing this right now?

01:05:54.939 --> 01:05:56.875
I'm gonna keep her
until I get my Chupacabra.

01:05:56.908 --> 01:05:58.175
- You don't have to do this.
- That's right,

01:05:58.208 --> 01:05:59.443
your little boyfriend
creep-azoid.

01:05:59.476 --> 01:06:01.211
- Stop, let me go!
- I'll shoot her!

01:06:01.245 --> 01:06:02.312
You tell your boyfriend,

01:06:02.346 --> 01:06:04.616
you tell your
boyfriend, the princess,

01:06:04.649 --> 01:06:07.084
I'm gonna shoot his mommy.

01:06:07.117 --> 01:06:09.386
Unless I get my Chupacabra.

01:06:11.522 --> 01:06:12.590
- Lance!
- Come on, let's go!

01:06:12.624 --> 01:06:13.524
Help me!

01:06:13.558 --> 01:06:15.158
Just breathe, just breathe.

01:06:15.192 --> 01:06:16.026
Lance!

01:06:19.162 --> 01:06:20.798
You don't have to
do this, please.

01:06:20.832 --> 01:06:22.600
Yes I do, it's 50,000 dollars.

01:06:22.634 --> 01:06:24.234
Come down, don't make this hard.

01:06:24.268 --> 01:06:25.402
- No!
- Come on!

01:06:25.435 --> 01:06:27.104
Let's keep moving.

01:06:27.137 --> 01:06:29.540
- Isla Moreles.
- Help me!

01:06:29.574 --> 01:06:30.541
Open the car door Van Steed,

01:06:30.575 --> 01:06:31.843
do something for
crying out loud.

01:06:31.876 --> 01:06:34.344
No, please, let me go!

01:06:34.378 --> 01:06:36.280
50 grand, baby.

01:06:37.247 --> 01:06:39.017
Don't try me!

01:06:39.049 --> 01:06:39.884
Come on.

01:06:51.061 --> 01:06:52.396
What was that?

01:07:05.175 --> 01:07:06.611
What do you want?

01:07:11.181 --> 01:07:15.853
It's time we talk.

01:07:40.510 --> 01:07:41.980
I tell you what.

01:07:42.013 --> 01:07:43.246
Why don't we take a break
on this log right here, huh?

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:44.916
Okay, step up.

01:07:44.949 --> 01:07:45.817
There you go.

01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:46.918
Not bad, huh?

01:07:48.385 --> 01:07:51.288
Oh you want some candy, huh?

01:07:51.321 --> 01:07:53.091
How about I take this off?

01:07:53.123 --> 01:07:55.560
Make it a bit easier for you.

01:07:55.593 --> 01:07:57.194
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

01:07:57.227 --> 01:07:58.730
There you go.

01:07:58.763 --> 01:07:59.731
There he is.

01:07:59.764 --> 01:08:01.099
Go for it, man.

01:08:01.131 --> 01:08:01.966
Here, let me help.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.001
There we go.

01:08:03.935 --> 01:08:05.036
There you go.

01:08:05.069 --> 01:08:05.903
Enjoy.

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:10.775
We're gonna get you out of this.

01:08:10.808 --> 01:08:11.976
Mark my words.

01:08:18.015 --> 01:08:20.618
Yeah, more candy, you're right.

01:08:23.386 --> 01:08:24.220
Go for it.

01:08:25.322 --> 01:08:27.658
Getting the hang of it, huh.

01:08:33.665 --> 01:08:35.365
What do you think, more?

01:08:35.399 --> 01:08:38.102
Or do you just want to
play with it? There you go.

01:08:38.136 --> 01:08:39.737
That's one way to do it, huh?

01:08:44.742 --> 01:08:48.245
Truth was right,
you are the man.

01:08:48.278 --> 01:08:49.781
I think so, right?

01:08:54.051 --> 01:08:54.886
Oh.

01:08:56.554 --> 01:08:57.854
This will all be
over soon, buddy.

01:08:57.889 --> 01:08:58.689
Lance.

01:08:58.723 --> 01:09:00.223
Aw, little dude.

01:09:04.895 --> 01:09:06.130
Lance?

01:09:06.163 --> 01:09:07.397
Who's that?

01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:09.000
- Lance, is that you?
- Who is that?

01:09:09.033 --> 01:09:09.934
Who's that?

01:09:11.368 --> 01:09:14.639
- Lance, is that you?
- Is that Truth?

01:09:14.671 --> 01:09:15.505
It's me!

01:09:16.808 --> 01:09:18.876
Wait wait wait,
what's he doing here?

01:09:18.910 --> 01:09:21.011
Whoa whoa whoa,
what's he doing here?

01:09:21.045 --> 01:09:22.647
No no, it's okay.

01:09:23.747 --> 01:09:25.381
- What do you mean?
- It's okay, it's okay.

01:09:25.415 --> 01:09:26.249
What's okay?

01:09:26.283 --> 01:09:27.852
Lance.

01:09:27.885 --> 01:09:31.122
Lance, your mom
has been kidnapped.

01:09:31.154 --> 01:09:31.988
What?

01:09:34.091 --> 01:09:34.926
By who?

01:09:36.027 --> 01:09:37.627
It was Glinevich.

01:09:39.697 --> 01:09:41.198
What?

01:09:41.231 --> 01:09:43.033
It's okay though.

01:09:43.067 --> 01:09:47.504
We have a plan.

01:10:11.562 --> 01:10:15.600
A candy colored clown
they call the Sandman,

01:10:15.633 --> 01:10:19.003
tiptoes through my
room every night.

01:10:23.708 --> 01:10:25.676
Baby, you know I love you.

01:10:25.710 --> 01:10:28.411
But I gotta take
care of myself, baby.

01:10:28.445 --> 01:10:30.848
I gotta look out
for me, sweetie.

01:10:30.882 --> 01:10:32.884
I gotta look out for
me this time, okay?

01:10:32.917 --> 01:10:36.187
And I need to get the heck
out of this freaking town.

01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:38.288
But I loved ya, I did.

01:10:38.321 --> 01:10:40.224
Yeah, for like a second.

01:10:40.258 --> 01:10:42.160
Come on, get the door!

01:10:42.193 --> 01:10:44.562
There's somebody at the door!

01:11:07.450 --> 01:11:08.553
Is it here?

01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:19.362
Come on, you know we had
some good times together.

01:11:21.364 --> 01:11:23.167
The sex was good, wasn't it?

01:11:23.201 --> 01:11:25.203
Yes it was.

01:11:25.236 --> 01:11:26.604
Come on.

01:11:26.637 --> 01:11:27.939
How come we never did this?

01:11:27.972 --> 01:11:29.439
How come we never
tied each other up?

01:11:29.472 --> 01:11:30.308
Do you like John?

01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:31.676
Do you like John?

01:11:31.709 --> 01:11:32.677
Does he doe this to you?

01:11:32.710 --> 01:11:34.712
Does he turn you
on the way I do?

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:39.549
He's, oh!

01:11:39.584 --> 01:11:41.484
That's what I'm
gonna miss about you!

01:11:41.518 --> 01:11:44.188
Your sense of humor, baby.

01:11:44.222 --> 01:11:46.523
I'm gonna be in Isla Moreles.

01:11:46.557 --> 01:11:49.060
I'll send you a postcard.

01:11:50.027 --> 01:11:52.330
Oh, in the basement.

01:11:52.362 --> 01:11:55.166
Well, that just
sounds delightful.

01:12:07.278 --> 01:12:08.279
Bat a dat!

01:12:09.512 --> 01:12:12.884
- Bap bah.
- Take it easy Glinevich.

01:12:12.917 --> 01:12:14.118
Take it easy.

01:12:14.151 --> 01:12:17.889
I'll take it easy when
I get my 50,000 dollars.

01:12:19.290 --> 01:12:21.125
Give me the briefcase.

01:12:22.293 --> 01:12:24.896
- Just be calm.
- You smell that?

01:12:24.929 --> 01:12:26.964
That's Isla Moreles.

01:12:26.998 --> 01:12:29.000
Badoo badoo badoo badoo.

01:12:33.536 --> 01:12:36.539
I'm gonna smell
that cash right now.

01:12:41.879 --> 01:12:43.381
I don't know if
I saw that right,

01:12:43.413 --> 01:12:45.149
'cause I opened it up and
there was nothing in there.

01:12:45.182 --> 01:12:46.751
So let me try it again.

01:12:46.784 --> 01:12:48.719
Okay, oh, look at that!

01:12:50.388 --> 01:12:52.189
There's nothing in there.

01:12:52.223 --> 01:12:53.658
There's nothing in there.

01:12:53.691 --> 01:12:56.294
- What is going on?
- You didn't really think I'd

01:12:56.327 --> 01:12:58.729
give you 50,000 in
cash right away?

01:12:58.763 --> 01:13:00.497
- It's close.
- Yes I did.

01:13:00.530 --> 01:13:02.400
I thought you'd
bring 50,000 in cash,

01:13:02.432 --> 01:13:03.801
'cause that's what you said.

01:13:04.769 --> 01:13:06.637
Who is that, who is that?

01:13:06.671 --> 01:13:07.605
I told you to come alone.

01:13:07.638 --> 01:13:09.640
Get him Steed, get him.

01:13:09.674 --> 01:13:10.942
Patience.

01:13:10.975 --> 01:13:12.109
Patience?

01:13:12.143 --> 01:13:14.645
What do I look like, a doctor?

01:13:26.456 --> 01:13:27.892
Who is it, Steed?

01:13:27.925 --> 01:13:28.960
Who is it, who is it, who
is it, who is it, who is it?

01:13:28.993 --> 01:13:29.827
Who is it?

01:13:31.562 --> 01:13:33.664
What's going on here, huh?

01:13:33.698 --> 01:13:34.598
What's going on?

01:13:34.632 --> 01:13:35.967
I'm the man with the gun, buddy!

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.705
Don't you forget it!

01:13:40.738 --> 01:13:41.572
Watch him!

01:13:55.019 --> 01:13:57.722
You little Chupacabra, come on!

01:13:57.755 --> 01:13:58.589
Come on!

01:13:59.690 --> 01:14:01.993
Come here, you
Chupacabra, come here!

01:14:02.026 --> 01:14:03.526
I'm gonna get you.

01:14:43.034 --> 01:14:46.470
Hey mustache.

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:51.541
Wow.

01:14:51.575 --> 01:14:52.710
Wasn't that hard.

01:14:52.743 --> 01:14:54.879
Good job, Lance.

01:14:54.912 --> 01:14:57.014
Come on, he's this way.

01:15:02.953 --> 01:15:06.390
Jesus, mom!

01:15:06.424 --> 01:15:08.592
- Jesus.
- Thank you.

01:15:08.626 --> 01:15:09.927
Thank you.

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:12.063
I think now is a
good time to leave?

01:15:12.096 --> 01:15:13.097
Thank you.

01:15:14.198 --> 01:15:15.800
Yeah, Lundquist is right.

01:15:15.833 --> 01:15:17.001
Let's do this.

01:15:26.143 --> 01:15:28.112
Lance, where is he?

01:15:28.145 --> 01:15:29.580
He's supposed to be here.

01:15:31.549 --> 01:15:34.318
- Oh no.
- Oh my God, Lance don't!

01:15:35.953 --> 01:15:37.988
Glinevich, no!

01:15:38.022 --> 01:15:40.157
- Stop!
- Hey, stop right there!

01:15:40.191 --> 01:15:42.159
- Chupacabra, stop right there.
- No!

01:15:42.193 --> 01:15:44.028
Hey, what, what are you doing?

01:15:44.061 --> 01:15:45.029
Don't do it, man.

01:15:45.062 --> 01:15:46.230
I won't let you shoot him.

01:15:46.263 --> 01:15:47.331
I'm gonna, I'm
gonna shoot you too.

01:15:47.364 --> 01:15:50.000
- No you won't!
- Yes I will!

01:15:50.034 --> 01:15:51.168
Don't shoot him!

01:15:51.202 --> 01:15:52.436
- What are you doing?
- I'll do it!

01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:53.572
You're supposed
to shoot me first.

01:15:53.604 --> 01:15:54.738
- I will.
- You'll have to

01:15:54.772 --> 01:15:55.673
- shoot me first!
- Get out of the way!

01:15:55.706 --> 01:15:57.041
- Then shoot me!
- I'm gonna!

01:15:57.074 --> 01:15:58.509
- Do it!
- Why are you

01:15:58.542 --> 01:15:59.643
- protecting that thing?
- Because he's my friend!

01:16:17.461 --> 01:16:19.096
John, John, John, John.

01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:20.264
No, come on, buddy.

01:16:20.297 --> 01:16:21.966
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:16:21.999 --> 01:16:23.568
Come on.

01:16:24.835 --> 01:16:25.669
I got you.

01:16:27.338 --> 01:16:30.007
It's done, it's done, it's done.

01:16:31.809 --> 01:16:33.744
John, John, John, easy.

01:16:39.283 --> 01:16:40.284
Lundquist.

01:16:45.122 --> 01:16:48.526
Man, you
really gave it to him.

01:16:49.493 --> 01:16:51.362
He had it coming to him.

01:16:51.395 --> 01:16:52.663
Yes he did.

01:16:52.696 --> 01:16:55.499
It's all over now, alright?

01:16:55.533 --> 01:16:57.701
You really gave it to him.

01:17:01.972 --> 01:17:04.108
Shush, it's okay, it's okay.

01:17:04.141 --> 01:17:05.209
We're safe now.

01:17:05.242 --> 01:17:06.578
It's okay, baby.

01:17:33.237 --> 01:17:36.173
What are you
gonna do with him?

01:17:36.207 --> 01:17:37.942
Does it really matter?

01:17:37.975 --> 01:17:39.476
Not really.

01:17:43.414 --> 01:17:45.082
Bye Ken, you weirdo.

01:17:46.517 --> 01:17:48.118
I'm not a weirdo!

01:17:58.796 --> 01:18:00.164
Hey buddy.

01:18:00.197 --> 01:18:02.233
We're sure gonna miss you.

01:18:02.266 --> 01:18:03.434
It's been fun, huh?

01:18:03.467 --> 01:18:04.902
Go ahead, little buddy.

01:18:04.935 --> 01:18:08.005
- Yeah, time to go, I think.
- It's okay, you can go.

01:18:08.038 --> 01:18:10.174
Mr. Lundquist isn't
gonna hurt you.

01:18:10.207 --> 01:18:11.275
I promise, okay?

01:18:11.308 --> 01:18:12.577
Alright guys.

01:18:14.679 --> 01:18:16.313
- Go ahead, little buddy.
- Let's go, Jeremy.

01:18:16.347 --> 01:18:17.682
Jeremy.

01:18:19.817 --> 01:18:22.587
Go ahead, little dude.

01:18:22.621 --> 01:18:23.954
- It's okay.
- It's okay buddy.

01:18:23.988 --> 01:18:25.389
You'll be safe, go ahead.

01:18:25.422 --> 01:18:26.790
- You're in good hands now.
- It's alright.

01:18:26.824 --> 01:18:28.926
Mr. Lundquist will take
good care of you, okay?

01:18:28.959 --> 01:18:30.327
I sure will.

01:18:30.361 --> 01:18:32.129
Trick or treat?

01:18:32.162 --> 01:18:34.465
- No more trick or treating.
- Not today.

01:18:34.498 --> 01:18:36.000
Maybe next year.

01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:38.902
I'm gonna miss you, too.

01:18:49.546 --> 01:18:51.115
Aw.

01:18:51.148 --> 01:18:52.617
- It's alright, man.
- It's okay baby.

01:18:52.651 --> 01:18:53.951
You can trust him.

01:18:53.984 --> 01:18:56.387
Don't
worry, I promise.

01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:58.222
It's okay man.

01:18:58.255 --> 01:18:59.758
Aw.

01:18:59.790 --> 01:19:00.692
It's okay.

01:19:02.026 --> 01:19:03.160
Don't worry about it.

01:19:03.193 --> 01:19:05.129
You're in good hands with him.

01:19:05.162 --> 01:19:07.998
You know, my grandfather
invented Jeremy

01:19:08.032 --> 01:19:10.200
so many years ago
to serve mankind,

01:19:10.234 --> 01:19:13.571
but was afraid people
would abuse him.

01:19:13.605 --> 01:19:16.675
Use him for evil
instead of for good.

01:19:18.442 --> 01:19:20.077
He's our friend,
Mr. Lundquist.

01:19:20.110 --> 01:19:21.713
Friend.

01:19:21.746 --> 01:19:23.414
I know that, Lance.

01:19:23.447 --> 01:19:27.384
Perhaps it's time we do
what's best for Jeremy.

01:19:27.418 --> 01:19:29.987
Allow him to be happy and free.

01:19:31.255 --> 01:19:32.724
I think that's a great idea.

01:19:32.757 --> 01:19:34.391
I think he's earned that.

01:19:34.425 --> 01:19:37.027
We'll take good care
of him, I promise.

01:19:37.061 --> 01:19:37.861
Sounds like a plan.

01:19:37.895 --> 01:19:39.063
Alright!

01:19:39.096 --> 01:19:40.598
Goodbye, everyone

01:19:40.632 --> 01:19:42.099
- Bye Mr. Lundquist.
- Bye Mr. Lundquist.

01:19:42.132 --> 01:19:43.467
Thank you.

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:45.035
Yeah buddy, staying with us!

01:19:45.069 --> 01:19:46.203
Trick or treat.

01:19:46.236 --> 01:19:47.504
Trick or treat.

01:19:47.538 --> 01:19:49.340
- Come on, guys, let's go.
- Let's go.

01:19:49.373 --> 01:19:51.542
Let's do it.

01:19:51.576 --> 01:19:53.377
Hop in, guys.

01:19:53.410 --> 01:19:54.813
Everyone in the pull.

01:19:54.845 --> 01:19:56.648
One, two, three.

01:19:56.681 --> 01:19:57.615
Moving out.

01:19:58.817 --> 01:19:59.651
Yeah.
