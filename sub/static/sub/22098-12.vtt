00:22.022 --> 00:24.565
NARRATOR: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

00:24.650 --> 00:28.027
I'm promoting you to Captain. I'm making
you commander of the Pegasus Air Group.

00:28.237 --> 00:29.570
You're promoting me?

00:29.822 --> 00:31.531
I need a CAG with guts.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.866
We are the leaders
of this fleet.

00:33.951 --> 00:36.035
As such, we need
to set an example.

00:36.120 --> 00:39.205
Oh, let's just cut through
the hand-holding, shall we?

00:39.289 --> 00:44.085
CAIN: Two of his men murdered one of
my officers while protecting a Cylon.

00:44.169 --> 00:46.879
They're guilty.
They admitted it.

00:46.964 --> 00:49.882
And under regulations,
I have complete authority

00:49.967 --> 00:51.759
to try, convict
and sentence them.

00:51.927 --> 00:55.680
And you and I both know that the
penalty for that crime is death.

00:56.265 --> 00:58.391
ROSLIN: I'm afraid
there's only one end to this.

00:58.475 --> 00:59.809
You've gotta kill her.

01:01.687 --> 01:05.898
Well, I see you got it to eat.
That's progress, I suppose.

01:05.983 --> 01:09.318
Can you get it
to roll over, beg?

01:09.903 --> 01:11.195
(SCOFFING)

01:12.698 --> 01:14.323
BALTAR: Admiral, please!

01:14.783 --> 01:17.160
I thought you might like
a fresh set of clothes.

01:19.663 --> 01:22.331
You know what I miss?
Sports.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.668
I used to go to the pyramid
court just before game time.

01:25.753 --> 01:28.463
Scalp two tickets.
One for me and one for you.

01:28.547 --> 01:31.132
I always liked to feel that
you were there with me.

01:32.926 --> 01:36.012
BALTAR: The Cylons call this
their Resurrection ship.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.848
At the moment, we are too far
away from the Cylon home world

01:38.932 --> 01:42.560
for the normal downloading process to
work. Which is why they built this ship.

01:42.644 --> 01:46.272
It contains the entire apparatus
necessary for Cylon resurrection.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.941
Then any Cylon
who dies out here...

01:49.026 --> 01:50.818
Would be dead.

01:50.903 --> 01:52.612
As in, really dead.

01:52.696 --> 01:55.865
STARBUCK: Our primary objective is
a Cylon vessel called Resurrection.

01:55.949 --> 01:59.285
Our plan is to jump in, in
the Blackbird stealth fighter,

01:59.369 --> 02:02.121
and take out the FTL drives
on the Resurrection ship,

02:02.206 --> 02:03.289
preventing it
from jumping away.

02:03.373 --> 02:04.791
STARBUCK: When the FTL
is destroyed,

02:04.875 --> 02:07.960
then our attack squadrons will go
after the Resurrection ship itself.

02:08.045 --> 02:09.545
How many squadrons?

02:11.215 --> 02:12.507
All of them.

02:13.801 --> 02:17.512
Jack, I want to transfer a
detachment of Marines to Galactica.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.305
ADAMA: I have a mission
for you, Kara.

02:19.389 --> 02:20.848
Anything for you.
You know that.

02:20.933 --> 02:23.309
Position Marines in key areas
throughout the ship.

02:23.727 --> 02:26.562
I will ask for you
over the wireless.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.357
I will call you directly. And
when I have you on the line

02:29.441 --> 02:33.027
and you hear me give the
command, "Execute Case Orange,"

02:33.111 --> 02:36.447
you are to terminate Adama's
command. Start it with Adama.

02:36.532 --> 02:41.911
I want you to pull out your weapon
and shoot Adm. Cain in the head.

04:11.835 --> 04:15.004
This is a frakked up thing
that I've been asked to do,

04:16.340 --> 04:18.132
but we kill people
for a living.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.343
They say shoot, we shoot.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.346
So you're
gonna do this?

04:26.642 --> 04:28.017
Yeah.
I'm gonna do it.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.270
Kara.

04:31.355 --> 04:32.897
I could use
some back-up.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.275
I'll understand
if you can't.

04:40.197 --> 04:41.697
You know better
than that.

04:44.326 --> 04:46.160
Yeah, I guess so.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.711
People have to
have this, Kara.

04:56.672 --> 04:57.838
Trust.

04:59.216 --> 05:01.926
Your word
and my word.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.639
If we don't
have this, then

05:08.225 --> 05:10.726
we really are no
different than the Cylons.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.067
Thank you.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.328
(DOOR OPENING)

05:34.418 --> 05:36.460
(WHISPERING ORDERS)

05:36.753 --> 05:37.753
Absolutely.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.714
Oh, lookee here.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.054
Sunshine boys are here.

05:51.268 --> 05:53.352
You know, the man you killed
saved my life

05:53.437 --> 05:56.063
and the lives of 50 other
men, you miserable frak.

05:56.148 --> 06:00.651
Hey, you?
You call me "sir. "

06:02.320 --> 06:03.320
Yes, sir.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.364
So I guess you were both
getting your poles greased

06:05.449 --> 06:07.700
by that filthy little
robot girl, huh?

06:09.494 --> 06:12.955
I'm sorry. I don't think
I quite heard that right.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.834
The glass...
I can't hear you.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.962
So, why don't you
open the door,

06:20.047 --> 06:23.841
come in, and we'll talk
about it in here?

06:26.470 --> 06:28.471
That's a great idea, Chief.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.514
Oh, they really
wanna do this.

06:30.599 --> 06:32.308
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

06:32.434 --> 06:33.768
(ALL CLAMORING)

06:34.102 --> 06:35.811
MARINE: On your
frakking knees!

06:36.605 --> 06:39.231
Slow it down, slow it down. Just
think about what you're doing here.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.108
Just think about
what we're doing here, guys.

06:41.193 --> 06:42.443
What the frak is this?

06:42.527 --> 06:46.822
Don't worry, sir.
I'll take it real slow, sir.

06:48.325 --> 06:49.492
TYROL: Hey!

07:44.840 --> 07:46.549
(TYROL GRUNTING)

07:49.177 --> 07:52.555
See, the gut,
it's a vulnerable area.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.391
Lt. Thorne
told me that once.

07:55.684 --> 07:59.478
He said, "If you really wanna do
some damage without leaving a mark,

07:59.563 --> 08:00.813
"go for the gut. "

08:00.897 --> 08:03.566
You'd be surprised what you
can do with the simplest things.

08:05.777 --> 08:09.405
A bar of soap,
plain old towel.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.742
How bad
could it be, right?

08:17.372 --> 08:18.414
You'd be surprised.

08:18.665 --> 08:19.957
(GROANING)

08:20.083 --> 08:21.208
Cowards.

08:22.460 --> 08:25.254
Cowards? Is that what you said?

08:26.506 --> 08:28.924
Now, give me that!
You know what?

08:29.009 --> 08:31.594
I lied. I'm not
going slow anymore.

08:32.554 --> 08:33.721
(SCREAMING)

08:34.598 --> 08:35.931
FISK: Attention on deck!

08:40.687 --> 08:42.313
Gage, Vireem.

08:42.397 --> 08:45.274
Out of the cell,
standing tall, right here!

08:47.944 --> 08:50.070
FISK: Remove the restraints
from the prisoners.

08:52.616 --> 08:55.784
Specialist Gage,
let me ask you something.

08:56.453 --> 08:58.662
Those men in there, are they
wearing Colonial uniforms?

08:58.747 --> 08:59.747
Yes, sir.

08:59.831 --> 09:02.750
Specialist Vireem, do you
agree with Specialist Gage here

09:02.834 --> 09:05.252
that those are, in fact,
Colonial officers?

09:05.337 --> 09:06.378
Yes, sir.

09:06.838 --> 09:07.838
They killed Lieutenant...

09:07.923 --> 09:09.506
Shut your frakking mouth!

09:13.803 --> 09:17.223
See, I don't quite
understand what I just saw.

09:17.307 --> 09:20.267
Because I think I saw
you two knuckle-draggers

09:20.352 --> 09:22.603
treating those men
like they were Cylons,

09:22.687 --> 09:24.063
which of course
couldn't be right.

09:24.147 --> 09:27.608
Because, if in fact
that was the case,

09:27.692 --> 09:32.696
then you're both subject to charges
of assaulting a chief and a lieutenant

09:32.822 --> 09:35.324
under color of authority
in a time of war,

09:35.492 --> 09:37.910
which, if I'm not mistaken,

09:39.788 --> 09:43.332
carries a penalty on this
ship that is quite severe.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.169
Now, get the hell
out of here.

09:47.504 --> 09:48.796
Sir.
Sir.

09:58.390 --> 09:59.640
Get out.

10:00.558 --> 10:01.642
Yes, sir.

10:06.481 --> 10:07.690
Sir.

10:09.359 --> 10:10.985
(TYROL COUGHING)

10:16.241 --> 10:17.491
Thank you.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.995
Thank you, Colonel.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.289
I don't want your thanks.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.086
I owe Lt. Thorne my life, as
do many people on this ship.

10:30.797 --> 10:34.216
He was trying
to rape a prisoner.

10:35.427 --> 10:38.887
You can't rape a machine,
Lieutenant.

10:47.731 --> 10:49.356
COMPUTER: ID confirmed.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.321
Do you drink, Thrace?

10:55.405 --> 10:56.572
Only to excess, sir.

10:58.575 --> 10:59.616
(CLEARS THROAT)

10:59.701 --> 11:04.705
"Only to excess"? Learn
that from Col. Tigh, did you?

11:05.749 --> 11:06.915
Not exactly.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.252
I understand
you belted him once.

11:11.254 --> 11:16.133
(STAMMERING) You gonna... That was
something I did without really thinking.

11:17.677 --> 11:22.431
Don't apologize. Some people
get exactly what they deserve.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.224
From what I've read
about your XO,

11:24.309 --> 11:27.603
maybe he needs to get popped in the
mouth every once in a while, hmm?

11:37.489 --> 11:40.115
I know you're
very close with Adama.

11:40.992 --> 11:42.284
Yes, sir.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.787
And I know
he's a good man.

11:46.289 --> 11:50.459
And I know he's had to make some very
hard choices over the last few months.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.710
Lord knows I have.

11:51.795 --> 11:54.380
Well, then maybe you can understand
why he did what he thought he had to do

11:54.464 --> 11:57.299
when you said you were
gonna execute Helo and Tyrol.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.553
Let me tell you something.

12:03.181 --> 12:06.475
I've had to watch a lot of
kids be put into body bags.

12:07.143 --> 12:09.978
They're covered with flags and
they float out that airlock.

12:10.814 --> 12:13.941
You think I don't understand
his feelings toward his men?

12:17.529 --> 12:20.322
Sometimes, terrible
things have to be done.

12:27.163 --> 12:30.416
Inevitably,
each and every one of us

12:30.500 --> 12:34.503
will have to face a moment where
we have to commit that horrible sin.

12:35.171 --> 12:38.966
And if we flinch in that moment,
if we hesitate for one second,

12:40.093 --> 12:43.095
if we let our conscience get in
the way, you know what happens?

12:44.431 --> 12:46.432
There are more kids
in those body bags,

12:47.642 --> 12:49.810
more kids floating out that airlock.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.690
Now, I don't know why,

12:57.193 --> 12:58.861
but I have
a lot of faith in you.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.699
And I want you
to promise me

13:05.326 --> 13:07.744
that when that moment comes,
you won't flinch.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.376
Do not flinch.

13:27.515 --> 13:29.308

from Pegasus, sir.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.695
They got you doing
courier runs now, huh?

13:41.779 --> 13:42.779
Well, I...

13:43.114 --> 13:44.698
I volunteered for this one.

13:48.578 --> 13:50.204
Kara told me
about her...

13:51.748 --> 13:52.748
Her mission.

13:55.919 --> 13:57.711
Come to change my mind?

13:57.921 --> 13:59.880
I just wanted
to hear it from you.

14:06.930 --> 14:08.597
Decision's been made.

Assassination?

14:22.779 --> 14:24.279
That's your decision?

14:27.116 --> 14:30.536
That's how you resolve your
differences with your superior officers?

14:32.080 --> 14:35.207
If you're gonna have some
problem backing up Starbuck,

14:35.291 --> 14:36.625
I can find somebody else.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.297
It's not about me
watching her back.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.552
I'm not going to debate this with you.

14:47.637 --> 14:49.346
This was
a very hard decision.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.015
But I think
the President's right.

14:52.767 --> 14:55.018
This is the best way
to safeguard the fleet.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.687
The... The President?

14:59.691 --> 15:01.441
So you and... You and
the President? This is...

15:01.526 --> 15:02.526
Yes.

15:03.861 --> 15:07.781
She's made of sterner stuff
than people give her credit for.

15:07.991 --> 15:09.950
Is this all I have to sign?

15:11.911 --> 15:13.829
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

You, too, Colonel.

17:03.606 --> 17:07.693
Sorry about this, Saul, but the
Admiral didn't feel comfortable

17:07.777 --> 17:09.194
with our Marines
under your command.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.822
Yeah. Sorry about a lot of things.

17:12.115 --> 17:13.865
Be sure your Marines
and our Marines are aware

17:13.950 --> 17:16.618
of their areas of responsibility
in case we're boarded by the Cylons.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.705
The last thing we need is
Colonials shooting at each other.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.374
Amen to that.

17:46.691 --> 17:47.941
Sit down.

18:08.045 --> 18:12.340
I've asked you here to find out
why the Cylons hate us so much.

18:19.849 --> 18:22.517
I'm not sure I know how to answer that.

18:24.687 --> 18:27.105
I mean, "hate" might not be
the right word.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.483
I don't want to
fence with you.

18:32.361 --> 18:33.904
I just want to know why.

18:39.702 --> 18:41.995
It's what you said
at the ceremony.

18:42.538 --> 18:46.333
Before the attack, when Galactica
was being decommissioned.

18:49.337 --> 18:53.340
You gave a speech. Sounded like
it wasn't the one you prepared.

18:56.093 --> 19:00.680
You said that humanity
was a flawed creation.

19:02.892 --> 19:06.394
And that people still
kill one another

19:07.897 --> 19:10.190
for petty jealousy
and greed.

19:11.400 --> 19:15.737
You said that humanity never asked
itself why it deserved to survive.

19:22.745 --> 19:24.079
Maybe you don't.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.681
Resurrection ship's
firing up their FTL drives.

19:42.765 --> 19:44.057
They're getting ready
to jump.

19:51.607 --> 19:54.776
Don't anyone look out of
the window right now, please.

20:07.081 --> 20:10.709
Starbuck, Apollo. Target's FTL
is history. She's all yours.

20:10.793 --> 20:13.378
STARBUCK: (ON RADIO) Roger that,
Apollo. Red wing initiated. Attack...

20:13.462 --> 20:14.462
APOLLO: Frak!

20:23.014 --> 20:25.807
Sir, I just received an emergency
transponder from the Blackbird.

20:25.975 --> 20:26.975
(ALARM BLARING)

20:27.059 --> 20:28.518
It's the
auto-distress beacon.

20:29.937 --> 20:32.022
Alert the
search and rescue Raptor.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.649
See if he had time
to eject.

20:35.943 --> 20:38.987
Attention on Pegasus. Prepare
to launch attack squadrons.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.406
Copy the Galactica.
Aye, sir.

20:41.490 --> 20:44.659
HOSHI: Attention on Galactica,
prepare to launch attack squadrons.

20:44.744 --> 20:48.496
HOSHI: Starbuck, Pegasus.
Resurrection ship 12 run at 15.

20:49.832 --> 20:51.333
Watch your intervals!

21:00.009 --> 21:01.509
(ALARM BLARING)

21:02.803 --> 21:04.137
Take your posts.

21:12.521 --> 21:15.106
RACETRACK: (ON RADIO)
Engaging Cylon Raiders!

21:15.191 --> 21:17.567
PILOT 1: Hey! Drop down,
I got them!

21:17.652 --> 21:19.361
PILOT 2: Nice work!
Two in one!

21:21.989 --> 21:24.157
PILOT 3: Angle it, angle it,
then take the shot.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.953
PILOT 4: Cover me!
I can't shake them!

21:30.665 --> 21:32.248
Mr. Gaeta.
GAETA: Sir.

21:33.876 --> 21:38.046
Order batteries Alpha through
Echo to switch to salvo fire.

22:05.241 --> 22:06.408
(HISSING)

22:49.785 --> 22:51.411
GAETA: Check
secondary battery.

22:51.495 --> 22:53.371
HOSHI: Full attack mode.
Fire at will.

23:12.641 --> 23:15.727
Tens of thousands of Cylons
are about to die.

23:16.645 --> 23:19.814
Tens of thousands, Gaius.
God will not forgive this sin.

23:21.275 --> 23:23.193
Do you think God
will forgive us?

23:25.821 --> 23:27.197
God forgives all.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.533
Don't listen to her.

23:30.993 --> 23:32.077
You think
she can help you?

23:32.161 --> 23:34.162
You think that that
broken woman can offer you

23:34.246 --> 23:35.830
even a fraction
of what I can?

23:37.083 --> 23:38.583
I know God's
plan for you.

23:39.543 --> 23:41.836
I know how to help you
fulfill your destiny.

23:46.342 --> 23:48.051
Do you know
what I miss most?

23:49.261 --> 23:51.513
You're going to laugh
when I tell you this.

23:54.183 --> 23:55.517
Sports.

23:55.851 --> 23:57.894
Don't do this.
Yeah, that's right.

23:59.146 --> 24:02.357
I used to love getting to the
pyramid game just before tip-off.

24:02.900 --> 24:06.236
By timing it right, I could
sit down right at the horn.

24:08.697 --> 24:11.908
And then let the emotion
of the crowd flood over me,

24:13.244 --> 24:15.036
waves and waves of it.

24:16.205 --> 24:17.872
Like electric current.

24:19.834 --> 24:21.209
That's beautiful.

24:21.502 --> 24:23.545
And I always
had two tickets.

24:24.171 --> 24:25.171
No.

24:26.423 --> 24:27.423
One for me...

24:28.050 --> 24:29.175
Please.

24:31.554 --> 24:33.096
...and one for you.

24:59.206 --> 25:01.708
Apollo, Galactica,
do you read?

25:02.376 --> 25:04.043
Apollo, Galactica,
do you read?

25:05.129 --> 25:06.546
Can you
say your position?

25:07.965 --> 25:11.676
DUALLA: Apollo, Galactica, do you
read? Can you say your position?

25:20.686 --> 25:22.854
Apollo, Galactica,
do you read?

25:25.024 --> 25:28.776
Apollo, Galactica, do you
read? Can you say your position?

25:31.280 --> 25:33.698
DUALLA: Apollo, Galactica,
are you reading this?

25:35.534 --> 25:37.202
Are you out there?

25:50.341 --> 25:54.761
Apollo, Galactica, do you
read? Can you say your position?

25:58.807 --> 26:01.142
Apollo, Galactica,
do you read?

26:06.148 --> 26:07.732
Apollo, Galactica,
are you reading this?

26:10.319 --> 26:11.527
Are you out there?

26:16.492 --> 26:17.992
I'm sorry, Kara.

27:26.437 --> 27:27.895

27:40.617 --> 27:43.077
HOSHI: Captain Thrace is
reporting massive detonations.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.413
The Resurrection ship
has been destroyed.

27:45.748 --> 27:46.748
Yes!

27:46.915 --> 27:48.458
(CREW CLAPPING AND CHEERING)

27:55.382 --> 27:56.716
They've done it.

28:03.807 --> 28:04.807

28:07.102 --> 28:08.353
RACETRACK: He's all right.

28:08.437 --> 28:13.232
He's a little shaken, but I
say again, Apollo is all right.

28:18.655 --> 28:20.698
All the remaining Cylons
have jumped away.

28:20.783 --> 28:22.075
It's over, sir.

28:22.451 --> 28:23.743
(CREW CHEERING)

28:23.827 --> 28:25.286
Congratulations, gentlemen.

28:45.182 --> 28:46.641
I'm ready to die.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.645
Send my soul to God.

28:52.731 --> 28:53.940
Please.

29:19.842 --> 29:21.551
I wish you were here, Lee.

29:23.429 --> 29:24.720
But what the hell.

29:55.836 --> 29:58.129
I am so very proud of you.

30:00.674 --> 30:02.175
TIGH: Secure from

30:11.727 --> 30:13.186
Glad we didn't need
your Marines today.

30:13.270 --> 30:15.271
Yeah. Yeah, me, too.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.900
DUALLA: Signal from
the flagship, sir.

30:19.735 --> 30:21.527
Adm. Cain on the line.

30:22.696 --> 30:24.113
Put her through.

30:30.913 --> 30:32.580
Congratulations, Commander.

30:33.248 --> 30:35.374
Congratulations
to you, too, Admiral.

30:35.876 --> 30:37.460
A significant victory.

30:41.089 --> 30:42.715
Is Starbuck with you?

30:43.091 --> 30:44.509
Yes, she is.

30:54.102 --> 30:55.436
This is Starbuck.

30:55.521 --> 30:58.648
I've been thinking about
what we talked about before.

31:09.117 --> 31:10.868
It's not enough to survive.

31:13.830 --> 31:16.457
One has to be
worthy of surviving.

31:19.419 --> 31:20.628
That's all.

31:23.966 --> 31:25.800
I think that's very wise, sir.

31:28.804 --> 31:29.971
Thank you.

31:45.821 --> 31:48.489
Commander, I wonder if my XO
is standing close by?

31:48.949 --> 31:49.991
Yes, he is.

32:02.212 --> 32:03.337
FISK: Yes, sir.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.047
Congratulations, Jack.

32:05.799 --> 32:07.008
Thank you, sir.

32:17.811 --> 32:19.103
That's all.

32:20.480 --> 32:21.689
Yes, sir.

32:28.864 --> 32:30.239
You look like
you could use a drink.

32:30.324 --> 32:31.324
(SIGHING)

32:45.172 --> 32:46.380
Thank you.

32:47.215 --> 32:49.467
Oh, by the way, there was
something I wanted to tell you.

32:49.551 --> 32:52.345
Last night, I was walking down
this corridor here, when I saw...

32:56.391 --> 32:57.725
(NECK SNAPPING)

33:16.244 --> 33:18.329
No, no, no.

33:19.081 --> 33:20.498
I can't...
I can't do this.

33:20.957 --> 33:24.460
Suicide is a sin.
But I need to die.

33:24.920 --> 33:29.423
What you need is justice.

33:41.978 --> 33:45.815
I know a place where you can
stay, where you will be safe,

33:46.400 --> 33:48.484
where I can
look after you.

33:48.610 --> 33:49.610
Why?

33:50.946 --> 33:52.780
Why would you do that?

33:53.281 --> 33:54.990
Because I love you.

34:36.742 --> 34:38.033
(SIGHING)

35:05.812 --> 35:07.104
Tell me, Admiral,

35:08.648 --> 35:10.065
can you roll over?

35:12.235 --> 35:13.402
Beg?

35:18.950 --> 35:20.451
Frak you.

35:26.833 --> 35:28.042
You're not my type.

35:56.571 --> 36:00.074
FISK: And she died knowing that
her ship and her crew were safe,

36:00.992 --> 36:03.202
and that her mission
had been accomplished.

36:04.704 --> 36:08.582
Nothing was more important to her than
her ship, her crew, and her mission.

36:10.919 --> 36:14.839
And as I take command of Pegasus,
I pledge to uphold those values

36:15.549 --> 36:19.093
that made her such an
effective and heroic leader.

36:30.605 --> 36:33.858
I only knew Adm. Cain for a short time.

36:33.942 --> 36:36.694
So what I have to say
about her will be short.

36:38.655 --> 36:40.406
She faced things.

36:40.740 --> 36:44.076
She looked them right in the
eye and she didn't flinch.

36:46.079 --> 36:48.497
That's something that
we do a lot around here.

36:49.624 --> 36:52.668
We second guess.
We worry.

36:53.753 --> 36:56.589
When I think about what she
went through after the attack...

36:56.965 --> 36:58.215
All alone,

36:59.426 --> 37:01.468
one ship, no help,

37:02.971 --> 37:04.263
no hope...

37:06.308 --> 37:07.766
She didn't give up.

37:09.561 --> 37:10.895
She didn't worry.

37:10.979 --> 37:14.231
She didn't second guess.
She acted.

37:15.025 --> 37:17.693
She did what she thought
needed to be done,

37:17.777 --> 37:19.486
and the Pegasus survived.

37:22.657 --> 37:24.658
It might be hard to admit,

37:26.411 --> 37:27.953
or hard to hear,

37:28.204 --> 37:31.999
but I think that
we were safer with her

37:33.251 --> 37:34.501
than we are without.

37:52.354 --> 37:53.395
STARBUCK: Lee.

37:55.732 --> 37:57.024
Lee, you okay?

37:59.486 --> 38:00.861
Are you okay?

38:02.030 --> 38:04.031
No. Not really.

38:09.829 --> 38:10.913
Hey...

38:12.540 --> 38:14.416
I broke my word to you.

38:14.834 --> 38:16.085
What are you
talking about?

38:16.169 --> 38:17.419
I let you down.

38:18.046 --> 38:19.755
I wasn't there
when you needed me.

38:20.215 --> 38:21.215
Look,

38:23.134 --> 38:25.052
a close call like that...

38:26.930 --> 38:29.223
That'd mess
with anybody's head.

38:31.393 --> 38:32.559
All right?

38:36.064 --> 38:39.316
It turns out I didn't
need you anyway, so...

38:42.862 --> 38:45.531
Let's just be glad that we
both came back alive, all right?

38:46.866 --> 38:48.659
That's just it, Kara.

38:52.205 --> 38:54.456
I didn't want to
make it back alive.

39:39.044 --> 39:41.587
(SOBBING) I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

39:43.923 --> 39:45.299
Same here.

39:53.600 --> 39:54.725
BOOMER: So,

39:55.852 --> 39:57.394
where do we go from here?

40:10.283 --> 40:12.826
ROSLIN: So, how did the Cylon

40:13.787 --> 40:16.789
manage to get off
the Pegasus undetected?

40:17.791 --> 40:19.124
No one really knows.

40:19.793 --> 40:22.586
There was so much chaos in
the aftermath of the attack.

40:23.880 --> 40:27.299
Thank the gods that you did
not have to do what I advised.

40:27.383 --> 40:29.134
That makes me
very happy.

40:29.928 --> 40:32.096
Yes. Thank the gods.

40:33.181 --> 40:34.681
How are you feeling?

40:36.101 --> 40:39.228
Well, I could sleep
for about a year, but...

40:41.356 --> 40:43.148
But you, however,

40:43.775 --> 40:47.277
do not have that luxury
because you have a new job.

40:48.488 --> 40:49.488
Billy?

40:52.075 --> 40:54.243
It took a little while
to find that jeweler.

40:54.327 --> 40:55.327
Thank you.

41:00.208 --> 41:05.045
Rumor has it that I know very
little about military protocol,

41:05.130 --> 41:06.922
but I do believe

41:07.006 --> 41:11.426
that someone who commands
more than one ship

41:11.511 --> 41:13.345
is called an Admiral.

41:24.899 --> 41:27.067
Congratulations,
Adm. Adama.

41:33.408 --> 41:35.159
Thank you, Madam President.

41:37.453 --> 41:39.079
Thank you, Billy.

41:41.374 --> 41:43.167
I never gave up hope.

41:43.251 --> 41:46.712
I just stopped trying
to get these a long time ago.

41:48.214 --> 41:50.257
Just goes to show you, Bill,

41:50.800 --> 41:52.593
never give up hope.

41:53.553 --> 41:55.554
Same goes for you, Laura.

41:56.347 --> 41:57.347
Hmm.

42:00.268 --> 42:01.435
All right.
