00:43.477 --> 00:45.078
Now where was it?

01:14.107 --> 01:14.941
Goodness!

01:32.291 --> 01:33.391
Really?

01:33.393 --> 01:34.995
That's not even HD.

01:36.029 --> 01:37.631
That's a corncob.

01:41.934 --> 01:42.966
I'm trying but...

01:42.968 --> 01:44.303
Give it a sec.

03:09.222 --> 03:11.856
Alright, we've heard
some great ideas from Bret.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.458
And Amanda you are
looking so lovely today.

03:14.460 --> 03:15.760
Show of hands for Bret.

03:15.762 --> 03:16.628
Let's go Bret.

03:16.630 --> 03:19.029
And those for Amanda?

03:19.031 --> 03:20.697
Congratulations Bret.

03:20.699 --> 03:21.766
What's the first
thing you're gonna do

03:21.768 --> 03:23.500
as class president?

03:23.502 --> 03:26.370
Kool-aid in the
drinking fountains.

03:26.372 --> 03:29.673
Come on, that's
so not practical.

03:29.675 --> 03:31.309
Says the also ran.

03:31.311 --> 03:32.510
Seriously!

03:32.512 --> 03:34.546
We already have a
terrible ant problem...

03:34.548 --> 03:36.547
Amanda, that sounds
a little bossy.

03:36.549 --> 03:37.950
Yeah, also ran.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.083
Also ran!

03:40.085 --> 03:41.585
Also ran!

03:41.587 --> 03:42.886
Also ran!

03:42.888 --> 03:44.388
Also ran!

03:44.390 --> 03:45.989
- Also ran!
- Shhh!

03:45.991 --> 03:47.559
Also ran!

03:47.561 --> 03:48.559
Also ran!

03:48.561 --> 03:49.660
Kind words please!

03:49.662 --> 03:50.795
Also ran!

03:50.797 --> 03:52.196
Also ran!

03:52.198 --> 03:53.697
Also ran!

03:53.699 --> 03:54.533
Also ran!

03:58.103 --> 03:59.905
I'm not an also ran.

04:01.541 --> 04:02.707
I'm not an also ran.

04:03.643 --> 04:05.108
You are amazing.

04:05.110 --> 04:06.010
Say it.

04:06.012 --> 04:06.847
I'm hot.

04:07.714 --> 04:09.179
I'm smart.

04:09.181 --> 04:10.517
I'm my own boss.

04:15.388 --> 04:18.625
When I respect myself,
doors will open.

04:23.028 --> 04:24.896
What are
you waiting for?

04:24.898 --> 04:25.999
My clothes.

04:32.705 --> 04:35.506
Breathe in love.

04:35.508 --> 04:37.275
Treat yourself.

04:37.277 --> 04:40.210
Start out your day
in perfect balance.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.129
You like that?

04:58.131 --> 04:59.062
Hell yeah.

04:59.064 --> 05:00.665
Jesus, hand over the ball.

05:00.667 --> 05:01.965
You want me to
fumble your balls?

05:01.967 --> 05:03.634
Just play with them.

05:04.837 --> 05:05.869
Okay.

05:05.871 --> 05:06.705
Ugh no.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.641
Shit.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.441
Really?

05:11.443 --> 05:13.044
I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.078
I got caught up.

05:14.080 --> 05:14.914
Ugh, wait.

05:19.251 --> 05:21.886
Listen Jenny, do
you need a ride or...

05:21.888 --> 05:23.054
That's really sweet of you,

05:23.056 --> 05:24.323
but it's Penny.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.862
That was my favorite shirt.

05:42.342 --> 05:46.110
You've got
a stop sign you asshole!

05:46.112 --> 05:47.511
I can't believe
you're still doing this.

05:47.513 --> 05:49.980
Haven't you been there
longer than most of the guys?

05:49.982 --> 05:52.749
I really don't mind Amanda.

05:52.751 --> 05:54.251
What about last year
when you broke your...

05:54.253 --> 05:57.121
I sprained my ankle so.

05:57.123 --> 05:58.456
You make me crazy.

05:58.458 --> 05:59.723
This is my big break.

05:59.725 --> 06:01.693
Sometimes you have
to do the grunt work.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.561
What, in 10 years they're
gonna make you pizza girl?

06:03.563 --> 06:05.062
Hello ladies.

06:05.064 --> 06:05.997
Bring us something honey?

06:05.999 --> 06:06.831
Nope.

06:06.833 --> 06:08.098
Come on darling.

06:08.100 --> 06:08.967
You know you look a lot
prettier when you smile.

06:08.969 --> 06:09.900
Thank you.

06:09.902 --> 06:11.602
That wasn't a compliment.

06:11.604 --> 06:14.138
These assholes bothering you?

06:14.140 --> 06:15.506
Oh hey.

06:15.508 --> 06:16.708
Hey.

06:16.710 --> 06:17.641
Probably shouldn't
put yourselves

06:17.643 --> 06:18.710
in these types of situations.

06:18.712 --> 06:19.977
Oh.

06:19.979 --> 06:22.179
I forgot to bring
this to our date.

06:22.181 --> 06:24.482
Awe!

06:24.484 --> 06:26.720
Oh, so it was a date huh?

06:28.220 --> 06:29.221
Sleepover?

06:32.458 --> 06:33.292
Okay.

06:35.128 --> 06:36.529
I went too far.

06:37.797 --> 06:38.763
I like the flower.

06:38.765 --> 06:39.599
Damnit.

06:40.667 --> 06:41.799
I suck at this.

06:41.801 --> 06:43.033
No.

06:43.035 --> 06:44.468
Hey, do you want
this while I'm here?

06:44.470 --> 06:45.770
I've kinda got my...

06:45.772 --> 06:46.970
Okay.

06:46.972 --> 06:48.239
Going to town
hall for the thing?

06:48.241 --> 06:50.141
What thing?

06:50.143 --> 06:51.378
You didn't...

06:53.246 --> 06:55.112
The mayor died.

06:55.114 --> 06:56.980
Shit, what?

06:56.982 --> 06:57.816
Oh shit!

06:59.619 --> 07:03.153
This is a tragic
day for Louisburg.

07:03.155 --> 07:06.490
Here with an update,
Sheriff Ross.

07:06.492 --> 07:08.559
Thank you Bret.

07:08.561 --> 07:11.362
Around 0300, Mayor
Gleason was found

07:11.364 --> 07:13.196
deceased in his Buick

07:13.198 --> 07:14.865
after going over a cliff

07:14.867 --> 07:17.235
at the Rock Quarry
in Badger Pocket.

07:17.237 --> 07:18.835
He might have
survived the crash,

07:18.837 --> 07:20.607
but then the coyotes.

07:23.410 --> 07:24.908
What about the
woman he was with?

07:24.910 --> 07:28.379
Oh that would be
Joanne, the Mayor's...

07:28.381 --> 07:30.881
She's recovering
at the hospital.

07:30.883 --> 07:32.484
That's all we have.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.054
Thanks Sheriff.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.955
I'd like to have a
moment of silence

07:37.957 --> 07:42.128
to remember the best Mayor
Louisburg has ever had.

07:43.763 --> 07:45.362
Born and raised here,

07:45.364 --> 07:47.764
he really understood what
our community needed.

07:47.766 --> 07:50.167
He renovated the church

07:50.169 --> 07:51.735
and then he also
negotiated the deal

07:51.737 --> 07:53.970
to bring us a
Honker's restaurant.

07:57.309 --> 07:58.509
Oh that was too much.

07:58.511 --> 07:59.744
Sorry.

07:59.746 --> 08:01.412
It's alright, it
was loud though.

08:01.414 --> 08:02.679
Okay.

08:02.681 --> 08:03.881
Anyway, a lot of you
are probably wondering

08:03.883 --> 08:05.615
what's gonna happen
with the open position.

08:05.617 --> 08:09.619
Well, there will be a
special election in one week.

08:09.621 --> 08:11.054
Candidates need to
submit their paperwork

08:11.056 --> 08:13.256
to Judy by the end of the day.

08:13.258 --> 08:15.492
I myself am running.

08:15.494 --> 08:18.328
I'm having a fundraiser
tonight at Honker's.

08:18.330 --> 08:19.265
Free wings.

08:21.534 --> 08:22.667
Johnson for Mayor.

08:26.939 --> 08:28.405
Coyotes?

08:28.407 --> 08:30.107
You're doing it right?

08:30.109 --> 08:31.843
Not again, mmm mmm.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.344
Amanda this is your chance.

08:34.346 --> 08:35.913
That's what I
thought last time.

08:37.116 --> 08:40.120
Nobody wants to vote
for an also ran.

08:42.489 --> 08:43.489
Hey grandma.

08:45.992 --> 08:47.424
What happened?

08:59.004 --> 09:00.472
Seriously grandma?

09:01.907 --> 09:04.508
I think you need to come
to town and live with me.

09:04.510 --> 09:06.376
Is this my prescription?

09:06.378 --> 09:09.045
Yes, and something else
that I think you should have.

09:09.047 --> 09:11.314
Oh goodness,
I don't need a gun.

09:11.316 --> 09:12.916
I know.

09:12.918 --> 09:14.184
I don't like them
anymore than you do,

09:14.186 --> 09:16.219
but grandma what else
do you have out here?

09:16.221 --> 09:17.789
I've got Thunder.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.058
Thunder is a cat.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.761
But she's my
sweet Thunder pussy.

09:24.763 --> 09:28.366
Okay grandma, can you
please not say that again?

09:28.368 --> 09:29.969
What do you mean?

09:31.604 --> 09:33.471
You know, if the
city would annex Hillview

09:33.473 --> 09:34.738
you'd have police
and fire out here,

09:34.740 --> 09:36.339
it'd be so much safer.

09:36.341 --> 09:37.507
I thought
you already brought that

09:37.509 --> 09:39.410
up with the City Council?

09:39.412 --> 09:43.314
Well, if I was Mayor I
could make that happen.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.583
Well, don't forget, the
Burkhearts and the Nickels

09:45.585 --> 09:47.150
are right next door.

09:47.152 --> 09:49.554
Grandma, the Burkhearts
can barely walk

09:49.556 --> 09:51.354
and the Nickels can never
remember who you are.

09:51.356 --> 09:54.692
You think that they're
gonna protect you?

09:54.694 --> 09:57.463
You've got a
good heart Amanda.

10:00.099 --> 10:00.931
Thanks.

10:00.933 --> 10:01.799
Over here.

10:01.801 --> 10:02.632
Yeah?

10:02.634 --> 10:03.467
Yeah.

10:03.469 --> 10:04.301
You found it?

10:04.303 --> 10:05.870
Is it under this?

10:05.872 --> 10:07.103
Well I hope so.

10:07.105 --> 10:08.941
Alright, here we go.

10:15.581 --> 10:17.749
You can do it.

10:22.021 --> 10:22.854
Oh wow.

10:29.061 --> 10:29.895
Wow.

10:34.867 --> 10:35.702
Got it?

10:37.936 --> 10:38.770
Ooh!

10:40.840 --> 10:41.840
Look at her.

10:46.745 --> 10:48.413
Grandma what's this?

10:50.416 --> 10:54.218
I think that's part of
my old sewing machine.

10:54.220 --> 10:55.220
Oh goodness.

10:56.723 --> 10:59.723
I don't even remember
when I buried this.

10:59.725 --> 11:02.025
Well it says here 1974.

11:02.027 --> 11:04.395
You would have been my age.

11:04.397 --> 11:05.328
Shit.

11:05.330 --> 11:06.329
Watch your mouth.

11:06.331 --> 11:07.667
Sorry grandma.

11:09.601 --> 11:11.202
Oh look.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.837
"Return within seven days."

11:12.839 --> 11:16.006
I think you might have
missed the window.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.141
Beautiful.

11:18.644 --> 11:21.279
Yeah well you can have the
piece of shit if you want.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.114
What?

11:25.718 --> 11:29.889
I think it's about time
that you should have it.

11:33.825 --> 11:34.661
Have fun.

11:46.939 --> 11:47.774
Jeff!

11:49.742 --> 11:50.775
Hey Bret.

11:50.777 --> 11:51.675
Hey buddy!

11:51.677 --> 11:53.511
Hey, question.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.313
Why do you need
maternity leave again?

11:55.315 --> 11:57.213
Come on man, we've
been over this.

11:57.215 --> 11:58.848
No I know I know,
but are you pregnant?

11:58.850 --> 12:00.284
Told you it wasn't a beer gut.

12:00.286 --> 12:01.218
Yeah, seriously though,

12:01.220 --> 12:02.620
you're gonna ditch us man?

12:02.622 --> 12:03.853
Jane's really gonna need me.

12:03.855 --> 12:04.954
I know, I'm just
messing with ya.

12:04.956 --> 12:06.857
Hey look, I got you a gift.

12:06.859 --> 12:07.791
Nice!

12:07.793 --> 12:09.426
Yeah, no problem buddy.

12:09.428 --> 12:11.896
Welcome to fatherhood.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.363
That is the last
thing in your house

12:13.365 --> 12:15.576
that's gonna get any piece
of your wife's boobs.

12:15.578 --> 12:16.663
I would sterilize that.

12:16.665 --> 12:18.135
He's definitely tried it out.

12:18.137 --> 12:20.438
That think cost me
150 bucks Maxwell.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.372
And you're late, why?

12:22.374 --> 12:25.208
Well, my grandma
got robbed again.

12:25.210 --> 12:26.077
Shit.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.011
Yeah.

12:27.013 --> 12:28.145
I'm really sorry to hear that.

12:28.147 --> 12:29.380
Thanks.

12:29.382 --> 12:30.647
As the new Mayor
I will make sure

12:30.649 --> 12:32.683
that things like that
don't happen anymore.

12:32.685 --> 12:35.586
What makes you think you're
definitely gonna be Mayor?

12:35.588 --> 12:37.288
I'm unopposed.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.323
And I'm the best
man for the job.

12:39.325 --> 12:41.424
It's not a microphone brother.

12:41.426 --> 12:42.559
Can you hear me?

12:42.561 --> 12:43.727
What if it's not a man?

12:43.729 --> 12:45.161
What if it's a woman?

12:45.163 --> 12:46.630
I'm running for Mayor too.

12:46.632 --> 12:47.665
Again?

12:47.667 --> 12:48.833
Don't.

12:48.835 --> 12:50.434
Seriously though,

12:50.436 --> 12:51.836
three years ago it didn't
go that great for you.

12:51.838 --> 12:54.204
So what's different
about this time?

12:54.206 --> 12:55.772
Thank you for
bringing that up.

12:55.774 --> 12:57.308
No problem.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.008
You know, I think because
people are tired of bullshit.

12:59.010 --> 13:01.444
And I, if I'm Mayor, will
actually make change.

13:01.446 --> 13:02.947
That's a lot of if's.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.881
It's actually one if.

13:04.883 --> 13:05.815
Wow.

13:05.817 --> 13:07.351
Look at the facts okay.

13:07.353 --> 13:09.420
How many women
presidents have we had?

13:09.422 --> 13:10.621
Wow.

13:10.623 --> 13:11.822
Other countries
are more progressive.

13:11.824 --> 13:12.923
Thanks Jeff.

13:12.925 --> 13:13.857
Like Iceland.

13:13.859 --> 13:15.258
Strip clubs are banned there

13:15.260 --> 13:16.794
and there are
countries in Africa

13:16.796 --> 13:18.094
where babies use their father's

13:18.096 --> 13:19.697
nipples as pacifiers.

13:19.699 --> 13:21.098
You should run
for office there.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.199
Amanda, is this how
this works, like this?

13:24.137 --> 13:25.368
You guys are dicks.

13:25.370 --> 13:26.603
Why would I know
how that works?

13:26.605 --> 13:27.538
Well...

13:27.540 --> 13:28.772
Oh because I have boobs!

13:28.774 --> 13:30.107
- Yes!
- Yeah 'cause you have boobs!

13:30.109 --> 13:31.275
Got it.

13:31.277 --> 13:32.410
Yes, that's exactly
how it works.

13:32.412 --> 13:33.676
How's this feel?

13:35.080 --> 13:36.179
It's umm.

13:36.181 --> 13:37.615
Wait.

13:37.617 --> 13:38.448
Shit!

13:38.450 --> 13:39.282
Give it!

13:41.553 --> 13:42.520
Point Maxwell!

13:42.522 --> 13:43.521
Torture device.

13:49.961 --> 13:51.462
Hey Judy.

13:51.464 --> 13:52.295
Oh hi Amanda.

13:52.297 --> 13:53.130
Hi.

13:53.132 --> 13:54.732
What's this?

13:54.734 --> 13:56.032
This is awesome.

13:56.034 --> 13:57.468
I think you'll
make a great Mayor.

13:57.470 --> 13:58.301
Thank you.

13:58.303 --> 13:59.602
Hold on.

13:59.604 --> 14:01.237
Are you doing what I
think you're doing?

14:01.239 --> 14:02.372
Why, what do you
think I'm doing?

14:02.374 --> 14:03.540
What are you doing?

14:03.542 --> 14:04.742
Oh, she's gonna do it again

14:04.744 --> 14:07.111
so I can get it
for the front page.

14:07.113 --> 14:08.344
Here you go Judy.

14:08.346 --> 14:10.814
And for the headline
it needs to read,

14:10.816 --> 14:13.049
"No more blowjobs with
your tax dollars."

14:13.051 --> 14:14.251
Perfect!

14:14.253 --> 14:15.953
I am so proud of you.

14:15.955 --> 14:18.222
Maybe you can accomplish
what I never could.

14:18.224 --> 14:19.689
Actually Ruthie,

14:19.691 --> 14:22.293
I would love it if you would
be my campaign manager.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.661
Eh, you don't want
an old lady like me.

14:24.663 --> 14:25.862
Get someone young and fresh.

14:25.864 --> 14:27.330
Stop it.

14:27.332 --> 14:29.232
Listen, seriously, I'm
not gonna run without you.

14:29.234 --> 14:30.800
Okay, on one condition.

14:30.802 --> 14:31.635
Okay.

14:31.637 --> 14:33.871
Don't just beat Bret,

14:33.873 --> 14:36.240
annihilate that shit head.

14:36.242 --> 14:37.574
Ruth, I love it.

14:37.576 --> 14:38.409
Language.

14:39.611 --> 14:41.046
That felt good.

14:41.880 --> 14:43.948
Now go get 'em.

14:43.950 --> 14:45.017
Oh my gosh.

14:47.253 --> 14:49.853
There's no going back now.

14:49.855 --> 14:51.288
Yeah.

14:51.290 --> 14:54.123
I would never ever
have the guts to do this.

14:54.125 --> 14:55.391
Stop it, you could do it.

14:55.393 --> 14:56.926
No I couldn't.

14:56.928 --> 14:58.529
Oh, it's Dex.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.164
Oh, how's that going?

15:00.166 --> 15:02.599
Well, actually I am making.

15:02.601 --> 15:05.871
I was, I was making
him dinner tonight.

15:07.606 --> 15:08.771
Mayor.

15:08.773 --> 15:10.676
Mayor!

15:21.620 --> 15:23.820
As Mayor of Louisburg,

15:23.822 --> 15:25.789
I promise that I
will make this town

15:25.791 --> 15:28.559
more business
friendly for shops,

15:28.561 --> 15:31.996
restaurants, hell
gentleman's clubs.

15:31.998 --> 15:33.264
I'm gonna bring it all in.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.498
I'm gonna make this town...

15:35.500 --> 15:37.333
Hi, welcome to Honkers.

15:37.335 --> 15:38.434
Are you here for the fundraiser?

15:38.436 --> 15:39.670
No.

15:39.672 --> 15:40.804
Are you
here for Bret Johnson?

15:40.806 --> 15:41.639
No.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.073
Are you a supporter?

15:43.075 --> 15:46.609
No I'm not, I'm just
picking up a friend.

15:46.611 --> 15:47.545
I look
forward to speaking

15:47.547 --> 15:49.612
with all of you one on one.

15:49.614 --> 15:51.214
Especially Miss Maxwell.

15:51.216 --> 15:53.449
Someone whose support
I did not expect.

15:53.451 --> 15:54.718
Not supporting,
not supporting.

15:54.720 --> 15:55.652
Not supporting.

15:55.654 --> 15:56.487
You are supporting.

15:56.489 --> 15:57.420
No I'm not.

15:57.422 --> 15:58.322
You are, you're here.

15:58.324 --> 15:59.356
Heads up.

16:00.493 --> 16:01.424
I just saw something
coming at me.

16:01.426 --> 16:02.358
What the hell?!

16:02.360 --> 16:04.395
Hey, move with me, come on.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.296
Oh I've got the moves baby.

16:06.298 --> 16:08.066
Okay, alright okay.

16:09.167 --> 16:10.333
Oh yes.

16:10.335 --> 16:12.368
Hey Dex, Dex
what are you doing?

16:12.370 --> 16:14.237
Way to go fellas!

16:14.239 --> 16:17.574
Bret, hey man this
fundraiser was awesome!

16:17.576 --> 16:19.642
City Council, thanks for
all the free food and shit.

16:19.644 --> 16:22.112
You guys are gonna
make the best team.

16:22.114 --> 16:24.280
You guys voting for Bret?

16:24.282 --> 16:27.284
You guys are voting for him.

16:27.286 --> 16:29.019
You want Bret for Mayor?

16:29.021 --> 16:30.554
Dex I'm running.

16:30.556 --> 16:31.990
You're running.

16:32.858 --> 16:35.825
Kinda changes things doesn't it?

16:35.827 --> 16:38.761
Don't worry, I'll
totally vote for you.

16:40.432 --> 16:42.165
Dex are you okay?

16:42.167 --> 16:44.200
Yeah yeah,
just one minute.

16:44.202 --> 16:46.804
Cool, I'm just gonna
let you rest there.

16:46.806 --> 16:47.974
Hey thank you.

16:50.042 --> 16:50.875
What?

16:51.911 --> 16:52.876
Excuse me gentlemen.

16:52.878 --> 16:54.714
I need you, come here.

16:58.850 --> 16:59.782
What's going on?

16:59.784 --> 17:01.684
Is the council backing you?

17:01.686 --> 17:03.386
Well it's a fundraiser.

17:03.388 --> 17:05.556
Oh my god, if I
were Mayor I would

17:05.558 --> 17:06.723
actually make this town better!

17:06.724 --> 17:07.957
I'd be able to
protect my grandma!

17:07.959 --> 17:08.892
What are you gonna do?!

17:08.894 --> 17:10.027
You're gonna put in strip clubs.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.228
Maybe.

17:11.230 --> 17:12.428
Face it, if you win
it's only gonna be

17:12.430 --> 17:13.998
because you have a penis.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.268
Oh, I don't need a penis.

17:18.670 --> 17:20.337
You're not gonna get
the votes because

17:20.339 --> 17:21.538
you're in your 30's,
you're unmarried,

17:21.540 --> 17:22.839
and you have a lousy haircut.

17:22.840 --> 17:24.074
You know what?

17:24.076 --> 17:25.474
You have a terrible
haircut, check it out,

17:25.477 --> 17:27.743
right there, 30's,
unmarried, awful haircut.

17:27.746 --> 17:28.678
What's the difference?

17:28.680 --> 17:30.313
The difference is I'm a dude.

17:30.315 --> 17:31.348
So it doesn't really matter.

17:31.350 --> 17:32.683
My haircut is standard.

17:32.685 --> 17:33.517
Let go!

17:33.519 --> 17:34.684
No!

17:34.686 --> 17:35.918
I wish that men would
behave like women.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.120
The world would be
a lot better place.

17:37.122 --> 17:38.888
I wish women
would act like men,

17:38.890 --> 17:40.557
it'd be more action less talk.

17:40.559 --> 17:41.392
Let go!

17:41.394 --> 17:42.358
No!

17:51.236 --> 17:52.903
Are you okay?

17:52.905 --> 17:55.907
What
just happened, shit?

18:03.815 --> 18:05.583
My watch is broken.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.985
I gotta go.

18:08.987 --> 18:09.988
Good talk.

18:33.478 --> 18:36.280
You
alright in there?

18:36.282 --> 18:37.215
I'm fine.

18:44.356 --> 18:45.191
Oh my god.

18:57.602 --> 18:59.136
Dex, what are you...

19:02.875 --> 19:04.643
Dex, what's going on?

19:06.278 --> 19:07.778
I was gonna make you eggs.

19:07.780 --> 19:08.912
Ew.

19:08.914 --> 19:10.583
But waffles it is.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.853
That's so sweet of you.

19:15.186 --> 19:17.221
What's going on with you?

19:17.223 --> 19:20.089
Shouldn't I be
asking you that?

19:20.091 --> 19:23.159
I didn't think I drank
that much last night.

19:23.161 --> 19:26.163
Hey, do you know who put
that ugly couch there?

19:26.165 --> 19:26.999
You did.

19:28.100 --> 19:28.934
Okay.

19:30.269 --> 19:32.001
Are you wearing makeup?

19:32.003 --> 19:34.838
Don't forget, I'm
cooking you dinner tonight.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.509
Gotta go to pilates.

19:41.179 --> 19:42.847
God, what is this?

19:50.321 --> 19:51.157
Delicious.

20:21.954 --> 20:25.556
Good
morning sunshine.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.089
Why are you dressed like that?

20:27.091 --> 20:29.160
I got an early meeting.

20:37.002 --> 20:37.837
Fuck!

20:52.751 --> 20:53.586
Coffee.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.511
- How ya doing?
- Hey.

21:22.513 --> 21:23.579
- Good to see ya.
- Ugh, hungover.

21:23.581 --> 21:25.281
Yeah yeah.

21:25.283 --> 21:26.284
Oh, alright.

21:31.322 --> 21:32.556
Sorry, excuse me, thanks.

21:32.558 --> 21:35.628
After you,
chivalry is dead.

21:39.197 --> 21:41.130
Oh, careful there hot stuff.

21:41.132 --> 21:42.432
Oh my god, sorry.

21:42.434 --> 21:43.934
I like the vests ladies.

21:43.936 --> 21:45.702
You like women in uniform.

21:45.704 --> 21:48.137
Yeah, potentially
out of uniform too huh?

21:48.139 --> 21:50.139
I'm gonna get you guys
raises when I'm Mayor,

21:50.141 --> 21:51.642
so don't forget to vote alright?

21:51.644 --> 21:52.475
Alright.

21:52.477 --> 21:53.777
Okay.

21:53.779 --> 21:54.613
Nice.

21:55.915 --> 21:58.548
I like the way he walks.

21:58.550 --> 21:59.750
Morning Amanda.

21:59.752 --> 22:00.519
Hey.

22:10.094 --> 22:11.895
Hey, do you know
who put these here?

22:11.897 --> 22:13.732
Bret, he likes cats.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.067
Okay.

22:17.069 --> 22:18.734
What are you doing at...

22:18.736 --> 22:20.771
Yo, what's up?

22:20.773 --> 22:21.972
Hey.

22:21.974 --> 22:22.673
Are you ready for
kickoff tonight?

22:22.675 --> 22:23.540
Yeah.

22:23.542 --> 22:24.907
Oh.

22:26.044 --> 22:28.379
Girls, not inside, please.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.249
Are you okay?

22:32.251 --> 22:34.483
No, suddenly you
catch like my grandpa?

22:34.485 --> 22:35.420
What the...

22:37.923 --> 22:39.489
I need a drink.

22:39.491 --> 22:41.260
Now you're talking.

22:42.727 --> 22:43.659
Nice purse.

22:43.661 --> 22:44.662
Thank you.

22:46.064 --> 22:47.897
Hey, could you get me a cup
of coffee when you go out?

22:52.137 --> 22:52.970
Alright.

22:52.972 --> 22:54.370
What's up boys.

22:54.372 --> 22:55.938
Bring it in.

22:55.940 --> 22:57.139
I actually really wanna talk
to you guys about something.

22:57.141 --> 22:58.607
Listen, I know
it's a little weird

22:58.609 --> 23:01.043
with Amanda and I both
running for Mayor,

23:01.045 --> 23:04.080
but I really need to know
that you guys have my back.

23:04.082 --> 23:05.281
Of course.

23:05.283 --> 23:07.451
Speaking of, I think
for this campaign,

23:07.453 --> 23:11.123
you should probably
stick to wearing makeup.

23:12.390 --> 23:13.557
Huh?

23:13.559 --> 23:15.692
No, no, he's got
great skin, great skin.

23:15.694 --> 23:18.030
But Bret, you have to shave.

23:19.465 --> 23:22.199
What the hell are
you talking about?

23:22.201 --> 23:25.135
I respect a man
who goes natural.

23:25.137 --> 23:26.804
But you need to win.

23:28.873 --> 23:30.773
Wait, are you guys wearing?

23:30.775 --> 23:32.341
You guys wearing makeup?

23:34.379 --> 23:35.578
Hey, just know that
we're here for ya.

23:35.580 --> 23:36.415
Okay.

23:37.549 --> 23:38.482
You're here for me.

23:38.484 --> 23:39.582
You're here for me.

23:39.584 --> 23:41.684
Perfect, good, got it!

23:41.686 --> 23:42.618
You guys are good.

23:42.620 --> 23:43.854
This is a good prank.

23:43.856 --> 23:46.657
Let's see how long
you keep it up huh?

23:48.159 --> 23:50.092
My door's locked.

23:50.094 --> 23:51.994
What's going on there?

23:59.972 --> 24:01.171
And?

24:01.173 --> 24:03.175
Mmm, it's really good.

24:04.776 --> 24:06.076
I'm really impressed.

24:06.078 --> 24:08.744
I thought you could
use a nice quiet dinner.

24:08.746 --> 24:09.747
Thank you.

24:10.849 --> 24:12.816
God, today was so weird.

24:12.818 --> 24:14.717
You know I'm
here for you right?

24:14.719 --> 24:16.821
Mmm hmm, mmm hmm, yeah.

24:26.330 --> 24:27.230
Hey are you okay?

24:27.232 --> 24:28.167
I'm fine.

24:29.201 --> 24:30.035
Okay.

24:31.070 --> 24:32.671
No, I'm not fine.

24:35.174 --> 24:36.772
I'm scared.

24:36.774 --> 24:39.108
I feel like we're
just starting at this

24:39.110 --> 24:40.876
and now you're gonna be Mayor.

24:40.878 --> 24:42.078
It's just a lot.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.413
Hey, that's not
gonna change anything.

24:43.415 --> 24:45.115
Amanda, you're gonna

24:45.117 --> 24:47.019
have guys all over you.

24:47.985 --> 24:48.821
I will?

24:51.055 --> 24:52.388
Are you jealous?

24:52.390 --> 24:53.225
No.

24:54.659 --> 24:55.494
Yes.

24:56.427 --> 24:58.928
Maybe, I don't know, I just,

24:58.930 --> 25:00.062
I have this feeling...

25:00.064 --> 25:01.132
Hey listen,

25:02.701 --> 25:04.768
I'm not like that okay?

25:04.770 --> 25:05.836
I like you.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.904
There are no other guys.

25:10.442 --> 25:13.844
Amanda why is
Bret calling you?

25:13.846 --> 25:15.345
Terrible timing?

25:15.347 --> 25:17.746
Why is he calling you?

25:17.748 --> 25:19.782
I don't know, it
could be anything.

25:19.784 --> 25:21.818
Then answer it.

25:21.820 --> 25:23.319
Okay.

25:23.321 --> 25:25.489
No, answer it now.

25:25.491 --> 25:28.625
You know what Dex, back off.

25:28.627 --> 25:29.461
Sorry.

25:30.829 --> 25:33.165
Geez, I'm not gonna hit you.

25:36.100 --> 25:37.334
Bret.

25:37.336 --> 25:39.502
Hey you really
stepped up your game.

25:39.504 --> 25:42.138
I see a shit ton of
your yard signs around.

25:42.140 --> 25:43.373
What?

25:43.375 --> 25:44.607
I don't have any
yard signs up yet.

25:44.609 --> 25:45.841
Hey, I have a question.

25:45.843 --> 25:48.913
Have you noticed
people acting weird?

25:51.649 --> 25:53.183
No.

25:53.185 --> 25:56.653
Yet, you're the only one
who seems remotely normal.

25:56.655 --> 25:57.988
Alright, I gotta go.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.255
Have a good night.

25:59.257 --> 26:01.057
Oh I will, I have a date.

26:01.059 --> 26:03.059
And she is picking me up.

26:03.061 --> 26:06.396
Which is good 'cause
I can't find my truck.

26:07.232 --> 26:08.066
Later.

26:09.067 --> 26:10.367
Hey there.

26:10.369 --> 26:12.735
You shouldn't be
walking all alone.

26:12.737 --> 26:14.538
Have you
always been a cop?

26:14.540 --> 26:17.174
Have you always been a hottie?

26:17.176 --> 26:18.375
Question.

26:18.377 --> 26:19.943
Got a
1031 at 4th and Main.

26:19.945 --> 26:21.610
Copy that, enroute.

26:35.827 --> 26:36.828
Oh my god.

26:40.498 --> 26:41.630
Hey.

26:41.632 --> 26:42.466
Hi.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.204
What are you doing?

26:46.804 --> 26:48.003
Come here.

26:48.005 --> 26:48.840
Okay.

26:49.707 --> 26:50.706
Just relax.

26:50.708 --> 26:51.542
Okay.

27:26.578 --> 27:27.412
What?

27:28.480 --> 27:30.749
I don't know what to say.

27:31.850 --> 27:33.582
Am I sexy to you Amanda?

27:33.584 --> 27:35.217
Yes, of course you are.

27:38.256 --> 27:41.057
I just wasn't expecting it okay.

27:41.059 --> 27:43.893
Today has been really weird.

27:43.895 --> 27:44.730
Yeah.

27:46.798 --> 27:48.732
I shouldn't have
eaten dinner tonight.

27:48.734 --> 27:50.032
It's probably what it is.

27:50.034 --> 27:51.268
You look great.

27:51.270 --> 27:52.202
That is not what it is.

27:52.204 --> 27:53.203
Yeah look?

27:53.205 --> 27:55.038
I'm totally pooching out.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.640
You are not pooching out.

27:57.642 --> 27:59.209
You just don't get it.

27:59.211 --> 28:00.976
Actually I kinda do.

28:00.978 --> 28:05.048
I just wish you knew
what it was like to be me.

28:05.050 --> 28:06.683
Wait what?

28:06.685 --> 28:07.916
You really don't
know what it's like

28:07.918 --> 28:11.988
to be judged by your
looks every day okay.

28:11.990 --> 28:12.821
Holy shit.

28:12.823 --> 28:14.257
Holy shit!

28:14.259 --> 28:15.892
Amanda the election
stress, look,

28:15.894 --> 28:18.230
it's getting to you already.

28:21.233 --> 28:22.400
Yeah that's,

28:24.202 --> 28:26.438
that's probably what it is.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.174
Hey it's
Bret, leave a message.

28:32.176 --> 28:34.743
Hey Bret, we
should probably talk.

28:34.745 --> 28:35.580
Call me.

28:37.282 --> 28:38.550
This is Amanda.

28:49.360 --> 28:50.195
Oh my god.

28:52.563 --> 28:53.465
Ellensburg.

29:11.248 --> 29:13.082
Back off Queen sucker!

29:13.084 --> 29:14.651
Jesus grandma it's me!

29:14.653 --> 29:15.487
Oh gosh!

29:17.289 --> 29:18.788
I don't see so well.

29:18.790 --> 29:20.790
I thought you were one of them.

29:20.792 --> 29:23.292
What the hell are
you doing here?

29:23.294 --> 29:24.594
Your prescription.

29:24.596 --> 29:25.530
Oh great.

29:26.865 --> 29:29.799
I stopped taking
that shit years ago.

29:29.801 --> 29:33.536
I thought it you needed
it for your strength?

29:33.538 --> 29:36.004
Are you calling me a wiener?

29:36.006 --> 29:37.840
No grandma.

29:37.842 --> 29:39.242
I got one of your yard signs

29:39.244 --> 29:41.913
but someone stole it last night.

29:43.080 --> 29:46.014
You've been doing
some redecorating?

29:46.016 --> 29:49.551
You know I'd vote for
you if I lived in the city.

29:49.553 --> 29:52.521
But you know your mom
and pop would be proud.

29:52.523 --> 29:54.357
Thanks for saying
that grandma.

29:54.359 --> 29:56.024
Bret says I don't
stand a chance.

29:56.026 --> 29:57.993
Well who gives a
shit what he thinks?

29:57.995 --> 30:00.430
The whole City Council
is completely behind him.

30:01.332 --> 30:03.098
Yeah right.

30:03.100 --> 30:06.537
They're giving him
the ole socket wrench.

30:11.443 --> 30:12.711
Are you okay?

30:14.745 --> 30:16.148
So don't worry.

30:17.182 --> 30:19.148
Why do you look so worried?

30:19.150 --> 30:20.384
I don't know.

30:21.719 --> 30:23.988
Do I seem different to you?

30:26.757 --> 30:30.359
I'm not really good
at this kind of crap.

30:30.361 --> 30:32.494
You probably need to get laid.

30:32.496 --> 30:33.495
Grandma!

30:33.497 --> 30:34.830
Oh don't grandma me.

30:34.832 --> 30:38.100
Now is the time to get
as much dick as you can.

30:38.102 --> 30:38.936
Okay.

30:41.138 --> 30:43.908
You've got a
good heart Amanda.

30:45.142 --> 30:46.577
Thanks grandma.

30:48.013 --> 30:49.781
Unlike some people.

30:51.049 --> 30:53.715
Get off my damn
property assholes!

30:55.887 --> 30:57.086
Oh my god.

30:57.088 --> 30:57.923
Grandma!

31:07.098 --> 31:07.933
Hey Roger.

31:23.482 --> 31:26.182
There you are, you're late.

31:26.184 --> 31:28.885
Despite acting like a
drunken fool last night,

31:28.887 --> 31:31.654
you still brought in 12,000.

31:31.656 --> 31:32.491
12,000?

31:37.495 --> 31:40.232
You're not gonna
wash your hands?

31:41.366 --> 31:43.066
Wow you're the City Manager.

31:43.068 --> 31:44.434
Focus Amanda.

31:44.436 --> 31:46.536
What are the top
priorities of the citizens?

31:46.538 --> 31:49.838
Well the quality and then
safety for our community.

31:51.376 --> 31:54.309
Strengthen economies, more
sidewalks, and dog parks.

31:54.311 --> 31:55.578
Dog parks.

31:55.580 --> 31:56.546
If you're gonna
win the debate,

31:56.548 --> 31:57.680
you gotta know this shit.

31:57.682 --> 31:58.517
Rick!

31:59.717 --> 32:00.817
Got it.

32:00.819 --> 32:01.751
Thanks Ruthie.

32:01.753 --> 32:02.918
Just Ruth.

32:02.920 --> 32:04.588
This is my son Rick.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.090
He's at West Point
following in my footsteps.

32:08.092 --> 32:09.325
Oh.

32:09.327 --> 32:10.126
Though we want
him to find a wife

32:10.128 --> 32:12.060
and make a good home.

32:12.062 --> 32:13.796
He also made you signs.

32:13.798 --> 32:14.763
Hi, I'm Amanda.

32:14.765 --> 32:16.699
It's an honor Miss Maxwell.

32:16.701 --> 32:18.367
The signs look great,
thank you so much.

32:18.369 --> 32:21.136
I checked out Bret
and Marge's yard signs,

32:21.138 --> 32:23.606
but yours are better.

32:23.608 --> 32:24.540
Marge who?

32:26.711 --> 32:28.544
That's good.

32:28.546 --> 32:30.214
No name recognition.

32:31.081 --> 32:33.215
She doesn't stand a chance.

32:33.217 --> 32:34.985
Yeah, not a chance.

32:36.687 --> 32:39.588
So you and Ruth have
this all set then?

32:39.590 --> 32:41.659
Oh check out the Jaguars.

32:42.827 --> 32:44.927
Obviously I'm gonna take
your campaign photos.

32:44.929 --> 32:45.861
Yes.

32:45.863 --> 32:46.796
But what else do we need to do

32:46.798 --> 32:48.764
to get you in that Mayors seat?

32:48.766 --> 32:50.567
Well...

32:50.569 --> 32:54.037
Oh my god, just change your
text tone to a ball and chain.

32:54.039 --> 32:56.271
I don't know,
there's just this like,

32:56.273 --> 32:58.741
sensitive side to him
that's really hot.

32:58.743 --> 33:00.443
It seems a little clingy.

33:00.445 --> 33:02.078
No, it's amazing.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.980
It's because you haven't
tried his waffles.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.648
Oh does he make his
own syrup for you?

33:06.650 --> 33:07.484
Ew!

33:08.719 --> 33:09.553
Ouch.

33:12.890 --> 33:13.990
Is that Bret?

33:13.992 --> 33:15.223
Mmm hmm.

33:15.225 --> 33:16.425
You giving him the
ole socket wrench yet?

33:16.427 --> 33:17.659
No.

33:17.661 --> 33:20.029
Alright,
then I've got dibs.

33:20.031 --> 33:20.865
Okay.

33:21.800 --> 33:22.898
Bret.

33:22.900 --> 33:25.702
You're not gonna believe this.

33:25.704 --> 33:29.238
Just meet me where
Honker's used to be.

33:41.552 --> 33:44.587
What the hell is happening?

33:47.425 --> 33:48.424
Don't look so glum.

33:48.426 --> 33:50.158
Come on, let's go.

33:50.160 --> 33:51.426
You're going in?

33:51.428 --> 33:52.663
Yes.

34:01.039 --> 34:01.873
Oh no.

34:05.342 --> 34:07.242
The world has
tipped on it's ass.

34:07.244 --> 34:09.244
Yeah I have a theory.

34:09.246 --> 34:10.846
Does your theory
involve my truck,

34:10.848 --> 34:12.148
because it's missing.

34:12.150 --> 34:13.616
Welcome to Peckers.

34:13.618 --> 34:15.050
Two of you?

34:15.052 --> 34:15.884
No.

34:15.886 --> 34:16.686
Yes.

34:16.688 --> 34:18.690
Right this way please.

34:23.494 --> 34:24.594
Well look who it is?

34:24.596 --> 34:26.596
Grandma!

34:26.598 --> 34:27.931
Oh I'd do him.

34:30.467 --> 34:32.168
Wanna go for a ride?

34:32.170 --> 34:33.302
No.

34:33.304 --> 34:35.672
Well shit sugar dick.

34:35.674 --> 34:39.375
You probably couldn't
handle me anyway.

34:39.377 --> 34:40.210
Ohh.

34:41.645 --> 34:43.279
Guessing she's not
usually like that?

34:43.281 --> 34:44.746
Right.

34:44.748 --> 34:46.983
Okay so, what
happened last night?

34:46.985 --> 34:48.053
Okay, shit.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.121
Right so, so well,

34:52.290 --> 34:53.889
the night started out great.

34:53.891 --> 34:55.657
I did my usual
thing where I called

34:55.659 --> 34:57.092
as many girls as possible.

34:57.094 --> 34:59.895
But instead of one showing
up, four showed up.

34:59.897 --> 35:01.697
So I'm thinking
this is pretty cool.

35:01.699 --> 35:02.864
They're digging me
because I can put

35:02.866 --> 35:05.934
down more drinks
than they're used to.

35:05.936 --> 35:07.436
Then all of a sudden
one of the hot ones

35:07.438 --> 35:10.440
leans into me and whispers,
"I wanna rip your shirt off."

35:10.442 --> 35:13.608
And I'm like, "What
are you waiting for?"

35:13.610 --> 35:14.944
A great moment for me.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.813
And they're all
rubbing all over me.

35:16.815 --> 35:19.114
Me and this other cock
blocker showed up.

35:19.116 --> 35:21.550
And the next thing I know,

35:21.552 --> 35:25.353
they just started
pushing us together.

35:25.355 --> 35:26.723
No!

35:30.895 --> 35:33.429
So that sounds just like
a regular ladies night.

35:33.431 --> 35:35.431
No, I'm pressing charges.

35:35.433 --> 35:37.467
Julie
Burn's acclaimed series

35:37.469 --> 35:39.569
American Women and Men is now

35:39.571 --> 35:42.137
available on DVD and Blu-Ray.

35:42.139 --> 35:44.340
The award winning
documentary that delves

35:44.342 --> 35:47.610
into the great women and
men in American history.

35:47.612 --> 35:50.045
From Martha Washington,
our first president

35:50.047 --> 35:51.813
to Henry Stanton, the pioneer.

35:51.815 --> 35:53.282
Oh my god.

35:53.284 --> 35:55.550
From our brave
soldiers in World War II

35:55.552 --> 35:57.520
to the men who burned
their jockstraps

35:57.522 --> 35:59.554
during the masculism movement.

35:59.556 --> 36:01.391
American Women and Men.

36:05.697 --> 36:06.628
We wished for this.

36:06.630 --> 36:07.797
I didn't wish for this.

36:07.799 --> 36:11.300
Yes, the other
night in the backroom.

36:11.302 --> 36:13.668
I remember the lights burst.

36:13.670 --> 36:15.204
Oh come on.

36:15.206 --> 36:17.907
We were arguing, you
were being a jackass.

36:17.909 --> 36:19.241
Debatable, I remember
you were going on

36:19.243 --> 36:20.842
about how everything
would be better

36:20.844 --> 36:22.344
if men and women flipped.

36:22.346 --> 36:23.679
I was thinking more equal.

36:23.681 --> 36:24.646
Okay well would you go ahead

36:24.648 --> 36:26.983
and magically unwish it?

36:26.985 --> 36:30.085
Maybe I'm not
ready to go back yet.

36:30.087 --> 36:32.487
Would you humor me and try?

36:32.489 --> 36:33.956
Alright fine.

36:33.958 --> 36:35.690
I wish things would go
back to the way they were.

36:35.692 --> 36:37.861
Your heart wasn't in it.

36:40.598 --> 36:42.398
I have no idea, I have
no idea if it worked.

36:42.400 --> 36:43.232
Did it work?

36:43.234 --> 36:44.235
Let's see.

36:46.203 --> 36:47.869
What do you think of these?

36:47.871 --> 36:48.705
Creep.

36:49.574 --> 36:50.773
There's your answer.

36:50.775 --> 36:52.741
Wait, why are you guys
in the storage room?

36:52.743 --> 36:53.608
My grandma's mirror.

36:53.610 --> 36:54.710
Yes, that's it!

36:54.712 --> 36:56.344
That's the missing link!

36:56.346 --> 36:57.947
Where is it?

36:57.949 --> 36:58.780
Remember?

36:58.782 --> 36:59.982
We were both holding it

36:59.984 --> 37:01.050
and we're the only ones
who haven't changed.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.652
Okay yes, and then it sparked

37:02.654 --> 37:04.786
when we touched it to the...

37:04.788 --> 37:07.292
Oh my god, look at this man.

37:08.458 --> 37:11.128
I'm gonna need a
picture with him.

37:12.297 --> 37:13.094
No I'm not gonna
take a picture.

37:13.096 --> 37:14.896
Fine, selfie it is.

37:14.898 --> 37:16.567
Hey handsome, hello.

37:17.835 --> 37:19.235
You like this too much.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.003
I love it, this
is freaking great!

37:21.005 --> 37:24.607
I can't believe you
wanna go home so soon.

37:24.609 --> 37:26.074
I thought I saw it.

37:26.076 --> 37:27.409
Everything goes to Good Will
at the end of the month.

37:27.411 --> 37:28.744
I think they came by yesterday.

37:28.746 --> 37:30.378
Shit, really?

37:30.380 --> 37:32.315
Hi, excuse me.

37:32.317 --> 37:35.116
The girls at table 12 wanna
take a photo with you.

37:35.118 --> 37:37.320
God, one of them tried to
grab my package last week.

37:37.322 --> 37:41.891
If you wanna be shift lead
you gotta make sacrifices.

37:41.893 --> 37:44.393
Okay, so she looks and
acts exactly the same.

37:44.395 --> 37:45.628
Can we concentrate?

37:45.630 --> 37:47.128
The mirror, can we
go to Good Will?

37:47.130 --> 37:47.965
Yeah.

37:52.837 --> 37:53.670
Grandma.

37:55.739 --> 37:57.172
Hey grandma!

37:57.174 --> 37:58.008
Grandma.

37:59.543 --> 38:00.509
Grandma, you remember the mirror

38:00.511 --> 38:02.311
we dug up in your time capsule?

38:02.313 --> 38:04.313
You opened the time capsule?

38:04.315 --> 38:06.815
We opened it remember?

38:06.817 --> 38:10.988
It was in this thing.

38:12.824 --> 38:13.657
So...

38:17.261 --> 38:18.495
It's your turn.

38:20.964 --> 38:22.866
How long you been here?

38:24.034 --> 38:26.471
We got here two nights ago.

38:34.078 --> 38:37.346
Guess you got five days left.

38:37.348 --> 38:38.614
Until what?

38:38.616 --> 38:40.683
To go back through
the mirror honey.

38:40.685 --> 38:44.188
Or stay here forever,
I don't give a shit.

38:47.659 --> 38:50.326
Hey my watch remember,
it broke that night.

38:50.328 --> 38:53.762
So we have exactly
five days at 10:02 pm

38:53.764 --> 38:56.098
to find your very vulgar
grandmother's mirror

38:56.100 --> 38:58.467
or we're stuck here forever.

38:58.469 --> 38:59.701
Hey, plenty of
time for us to go

38:59.703 --> 39:02.605
see a woman's football game.

39:02.607 --> 39:03.505
You think it will be...

39:03.507 --> 39:04.407
Lingerie?

39:04.409 --> 39:05.243
No.

39:06.677 --> 39:07.944
Well I don't think you
can say that definitively

39:07.946 --> 39:10.779
until you actually
see it first hand.

39:10.781 --> 39:12.014
So what
did it look like?

39:12.016 --> 39:14.452
Well it's small, handheld...

39:15.853 --> 39:17.320
It's got a diamond shape.

39:17.322 --> 39:18.987
Like a thingy on the handle.

39:18.989 --> 39:21.892
It's a fork thing,
it was copper.

39:23.094 --> 39:25.996
Yeah, we don't
carry any mirrors.

39:27.998 --> 39:29.799
Okay so why'd you
ask what it looked like

39:29.801 --> 39:32.768
if you don't carry any mirrors.

39:32.770 --> 39:34.704
I was just trying to help.

39:34.706 --> 39:35.540
Cool.

39:48.786 --> 39:49.851
Why is this locked?

39:49.853 --> 39:52.154
I have an idea.

39:52.156 --> 39:53.324
No, mmm mmm.

39:57.462 --> 39:58.594
It's great!

39:58.596 --> 39:59.429
Holy shit!

40:00.331 --> 40:01.332
Oh my God.

40:02.632 --> 40:04.266
Don't get used to this.

40:04.268 --> 40:05.900
Everything okay?

40:05.902 --> 40:07.136
Yes.

40:07.138 --> 40:08.503
Everything is just
fine gentlemen.

40:08.505 --> 40:10.038
I do need to have a
talk with Bret though,

40:10.040 --> 40:11.607
so why don't you guys go ahead

40:11.609 --> 40:13.842
and go to lunch on me.

40:13.844 --> 40:14.677
Really?

40:14.679 --> 40:15.511
Yes.

40:15.513 --> 40:16.445
You deserve it.

40:16.447 --> 40:17.913
You guys have been working hard

40:17.915 --> 40:20.483
and it's your last day
before you take leave so.

40:20.485 --> 40:21.683
You know what, you
guys go ahead and

40:21.685 --> 40:24.152
get a pedicure
too, on the house.

40:24.154 --> 40:25.887
That's what I'm talking about.

40:25.889 --> 40:27.288
Amanda you are so sweet.

40:27.290 --> 40:29.292
Really, you are loved.

40:31.628 --> 40:32.460
See ya.

40:32.462 --> 40:33.797
Bye gentlemen.

40:36.900 --> 40:38.300
So I'm a shitty boss because

40:38.302 --> 40:40.235
I don't buy them
lunches and toe jobs.

40:40.237 --> 40:41.070
What?!

40:41.072 --> 40:42.103
Oh my God no.

40:42.105 --> 40:43.572
Ew, do you know what that means?

40:43.574 --> 40:44.407
Yeah.

40:44.409 --> 40:46.141
Gross.

40:46.143 --> 40:47.742
We need to call the
police about this mirror okay.

40:47.744 --> 40:48.878
Okay.

40:48.880 --> 40:49.779
Like now.

40:49.781 --> 40:50.614
Okay.

40:52.215 --> 40:53.983
The debate, we forgot
about the debate.

40:53.985 --> 40:55.384
Who cares about the debate?!

40:55.386 --> 40:56.951
We're not going to the debate!

40:56.953 --> 40:59.320
What if we mess up the space
time continuum or something?

40:59.322 --> 41:01.290
We have already done that doc.

41:01.292 --> 41:02.991
Look, we will look
for the mirror,

41:02.993 --> 41:04.626
but in the meantime
I think we need

41:04.628 --> 41:05.628
to see where this goes.

41:05.630 --> 41:06.462
Just see where it goes.

41:06.464 --> 41:07.295
Yes, come on.

41:07.297 --> 41:08.463
Yeah run with it, fun.

41:08.465 --> 41:10.132
That mirror is
priority number one.

41:10.134 --> 41:11.469
Fine!

41:17.741 --> 41:20.409
What a wonderful turnout.

41:21.978 --> 41:23.712
We'll start with an
opening statement

41:23.714 --> 41:25.346
from each candidate.

41:25.348 --> 41:26.683
Gentlemen first.

41:30.922 --> 41:32.490
I'm Bret Johnson.

41:33.657 --> 41:36.592
A vote for me means a safer town

41:36.594 --> 41:38.393
and a stronger police and fire.

41:38.395 --> 41:40.628
And I will work on lowering

41:40.630 --> 41:42.998
property taxes for Louisburg.

41:47.205 --> 41:48.139
Ellensburg.

41:49.373 --> 41:52.174
He's a little nervous,
nothing wrong with that.

41:52.176 --> 41:54.543
I'm Marge Crane,
my goal is simple.

41:54.545 --> 41:56.645
Investigate the
nuclear artifacts

41:56.647 --> 41:59.547
that are being smuggled
out of Hanford.

41:59.549 --> 42:01.250
Eliminate them and our water

42:01.252 --> 42:04.119
won't make the tea
taste funny no more.

42:06.723 --> 42:08.389
Amanda Maxwell, City Council.

42:08.391 --> 42:10.159
In addition to
safeguarding our elders

42:10.161 --> 42:12.494
by rezoning
Hillview, I also plan

42:12.496 --> 42:16.532
on leading our community into
a new era of egalitarianism.

42:16.534 --> 42:19.400
Starting with equal
pay for women.

42:19.402 --> 42:21.839
You mean equal pay for men.

42:24.674 --> 42:26.308
Yes.

42:26.310 --> 42:30.248
I meant equal pay for
men, that's what I meant.

42:31.214 --> 42:32.780
And new dog parks.

42:36.520 --> 42:38.954
Why don't you tell us
more about those dog parks?

42:38.956 --> 42:40.523
No, no.

42:40.525 --> 42:43.558
We're gonna talk about
what Jeff just said.

42:43.560 --> 42:44.995
Equal pay for men

42:46.130 --> 42:49.367
and protection against
sexual harassment.

42:50.567 --> 42:53.869
Men should not have
their dignity revoked

42:53.871 --> 42:55.904
or their shirts.

42:55.906 --> 42:58.206
Or be forced to kiss other men.

42:58.208 --> 42:59.708
That's right.

42:59.710 --> 43:00.643
Damnit.

43:00.645 --> 43:01.876
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

43:01.878 --> 43:03.645
You're saying that two
men shouldn't kiss?

43:03.647 --> 43:04.481
No.

43:06.384 --> 43:08.918
No, it's not what I said.

43:08.920 --> 43:13.121
I mean that men who
don't normally kiss men

43:13.123 --> 43:14.590
don't have to do it.

43:14.592 --> 43:15.757
Shouldn't have to.

43:15.759 --> 43:18.293
If they don't want to.

43:18.295 --> 43:20.063
I'm for equal rights.

43:22.600 --> 43:25.733
Bret, I like the
way your shirt fits.

43:25.735 --> 43:28.404
Can you tell my husband
where you got it?

43:28.406 --> 43:29.938
Sure will.

43:29.940 --> 43:31.607
I like that you go natural.

43:31.609 --> 43:32.442
It's bold.

43:33.310 --> 43:34.610
That's good.

43:34.612 --> 43:35.811
Thank you, I appreciate that.

43:35.813 --> 43:37.179
And it's clear
that you don't spend

43:37.181 --> 43:38.947
all your money at the salon.

43:38.949 --> 43:41.050
You've got a very
practical haircut

43:41.052 --> 43:44.652
so you can focus on
more important things.

43:44.654 --> 43:46.487
Thank you for noticing Amanda.

43:46.489 --> 43:48.157
You're welcome.

43:48.159 --> 43:50.793
Let's go ahead and
talk about anything else.

43:50.795 --> 43:53.094
Yeah, are you single?

43:53.096 --> 43:54.862
That's harassment.

43:54.864 --> 43:56.398
Total bullshit!

43:56.400 --> 43:59.835
Look, whether we have a
woman or a man at the helm,

43:59.837 --> 44:00.936
what we need is someone who's

44:00.938 --> 44:03.538
not preoccupied with bickering.

44:03.540 --> 44:05.007
But who can save our sorry asses

44:05.009 --> 44:07.509
from radioactive shit!

44:17.587 --> 44:19.454
I hate you.

44:19.456 --> 44:20.958
I hate you more.

44:31.935 --> 44:34.203
Alright, I'm not
gonna sugarcoat it.

44:34.205 --> 44:36.873
That sucked a hot cheesy vagina!

44:40.043 --> 44:41.777
Not as bad as that swing though.

44:41.779 --> 44:43.279
How am I supposed
to get over that?

44:43.281 --> 44:45.179
Nobody pays attention
to debates, who cares?

44:45.181 --> 44:46.748
I looked like
a freaking idiot.

44:46.750 --> 44:47.949
I mean,

44:47.951 --> 44:50.351
sometimes you have
to look like an idiot

44:50.353 --> 44:53.054
to know how not to become one.

44:53.056 --> 44:54.590
That is the worst
motivational speech

44:54.592 --> 44:56.994
I have ever heard in my life.

44:58.328 --> 45:00.395
When I look at you
I don't see an idiot.

45:00.397 --> 45:02.197
I see a woman.

45:02.199 --> 45:04.132
A woman who's a fighter!

45:04.134 --> 45:06.467
And that fighter wants
to be a champion!

45:06.469 --> 45:07.536
Yes!

45:07.538 --> 45:09.837
So you got hit, whatever.

45:09.839 --> 45:11.407
Ovary up.

45:11.409 --> 45:12.775
Get up off your ass

45:12.777 --> 45:15.411
and get 'em with a
roundhouse kick to the face.

45:15.413 --> 45:16.911
Now I have to
learn how to kick?

45:16.913 --> 45:20.616
No, but you gotta hit better
than a freaking politician.

45:22.085 --> 45:23.853
Alright, watch out.

45:29.493 --> 45:30.958
Yes!

45:30.960 --> 45:32.128
Yes, yes, yes!

45:33.029 --> 45:35.298
Jam out with your clam out.

45:39.235 --> 45:41.170
Alright, damage control.

45:41.172 --> 45:42.570
Alright,
priority number one.

45:42.572 --> 45:43.938
Get out and talk with people.

45:43.940 --> 45:45.842
I'm good with people.

45:49.547 --> 45:52.213
We need quality education
for our children

45:52.215 --> 45:55.217
and protection for our seniors.

45:55.219 --> 45:57.386
And more parks for our dogs.

46:00.056 --> 46:01.989
Listen Penny, if
you see a mirror

46:01.991 --> 46:03.958
that looks like that
could you give me a call?

46:03.960 --> 46:05.728
Yeah I'll call you sweetheart.

46:05.730 --> 46:07.096
Thanks.

46:07.098 --> 46:08.831
You've got to
maintain your focus.

46:08.833 --> 46:10.699
Minimize your distractions.

46:10.701 --> 46:11.534
Got it.

46:13.371 --> 46:16.474
Sorry, now's not
really a great time.

46:18.509 --> 46:20.509
Pick some issues
to differentiate yourself.

46:20.511 --> 46:21.476
Men's rights

46:21.478 --> 46:22.511
Our human rights!

46:22.513 --> 46:23.344
What's going on?

46:23.346 --> 46:24.179
Hey.

46:24.181 --> 46:25.116
Hey Jeff.

46:26.717 --> 46:27.983
What?

46:27.985 --> 46:29.884
Prepare for the
candidates fishing trip.

46:29.886 --> 46:31.253
Don't wanna look
like a dumb shit.

46:31.255 --> 46:32.587
For the big fish
I'm gonna catch.

46:32.589 --> 46:33.788
Have you been working out?

46:33.790 --> 46:34.623
Oh.

46:34.625 --> 46:36.657
Love your shoes.

46:36.659 --> 46:40.362
Protecting a man's
right to a vasectomy

46:40.364 --> 46:42.864
is the main reason
I'm running for Mayor!

46:45.402 --> 46:46.634
You have beautiful eyes.

46:46.636 --> 46:47.703
Perfect.

46:47.705 --> 46:49.371
That's so sweet.

46:49.373 --> 46:52.808
Your hair looks
amazing too, beautiful.

46:52.810 --> 46:54.710
Okay loosen up
for me a little bit.

46:54.712 --> 46:56.779
Alright, sex sells.

46:56.781 --> 46:59.614
While freeing and empowering
men at the same time.

46:59.616 --> 47:00.983
Work your image.

47:00.985 --> 47:04.420
Be the women people
feel they can relate to.

47:04.422 --> 47:05.654
There it is.

47:05.656 --> 47:08.290
Smile with your eyes,
but not your mouth.

47:08.292 --> 47:11.127
Oh my God, oh
my God, oh my God!

47:12.830 --> 47:14.295
You just got maced.

47:14.297 --> 47:15.329
Now you got it!

47:15.331 --> 47:16.665
You look so skinny.

47:16.667 --> 47:17.833
Yeah?

47:17.835 --> 47:20.070
Go punch him in the nuts.

47:21.038 --> 47:22.438
Oh Jeff.

47:22.440 --> 47:23.371
I know.

47:23.373 --> 47:25.107
I get it.

47:25.109 --> 47:25.940
I get it.

47:28.679 --> 47:31.612
You should get your
head gasket checked out.

47:31.614 --> 47:33.581
That's not right.

47:33.583 --> 47:34.583
You did this.

47:34.585 --> 47:35.683
I did that.

47:35.685 --> 47:36.652
I did that.

47:36.654 --> 47:38.820
You did this with your balls.

47:38.822 --> 47:40.788
I freaking love this town!

47:48.766 --> 47:50.132
I don't know
if you're trying to win

47:50.134 --> 47:51.800
or sabotage yourself.

47:51.802 --> 47:53.235
What, I've been
doing your whole list.

47:53.237 --> 47:54.969
My list doesn't
include getting maced

47:54.971 --> 47:56.337
or driving drunk.

47:56.339 --> 47:57.173
Touche.

47:59.944 --> 48:01.143
What is she doing here?

48:01.145 --> 48:02.244
We need the
support of the county's

48:02.246 --> 48:03.811
biggest developer.

48:03.813 --> 48:05.646
Two days before the election.

48:05.648 --> 48:07.081
Don't screw this up.

48:07.083 --> 48:07.916
Hi.

48:07.918 --> 48:08.752
Hi Judy.

48:09.652 --> 48:11.552
Alright, I'll be honest.

48:11.554 --> 48:12.487
Okay.

48:12.489 --> 48:14.121
I've always liked you Maxwell.

48:14.123 --> 48:15.324
But I've been
hearing some things

48:15.326 --> 48:16.858
about you lately.

48:16.860 --> 48:19.228
Super awesome things right?

48:19.230 --> 48:20.695
I guess the best
way of putting it

48:20.697 --> 48:23.030
is you're just not yourself.

48:23.032 --> 48:24.266
That could be my fault.

48:24.268 --> 48:25.766
I'm putting a lot
of pressure on her.

48:25.768 --> 48:28.339
A Mayor lives under pressure.

48:29.306 --> 48:30.838
20,000.

48:30.840 --> 48:32.574
And maybe more from the casino.

48:32.576 --> 48:36.210
Don't worry about the
limit, it's under the table.

48:36.212 --> 48:37.545
Thank you.

48:37.547 --> 48:38.381
Wow, okay.

48:40.484 --> 48:43.018
Yeah, let's go win this thing.

48:43.020 --> 48:44.418
Absolutely.

48:44.420 --> 48:46.788
And if I'm going
to be redeveloping

48:46.790 --> 48:49.324
the Hillview community for Ruth,

48:49.326 --> 48:51.793
I just need to know
the Mayor's on board.

48:51.795 --> 48:54.262
You mean rezoning Hillview.

48:54.264 --> 48:57.699
We're gonna tear it up
and make shiny strip malls.

48:57.701 --> 48:59.567
But what are you gonna
do with the residents?

48:59.569 --> 49:00.768
They'll get bought out.

49:00.770 --> 49:03.204
And the rest is up to them.

49:03.206 --> 49:05.806
Your grandmother will be fine.

49:05.808 --> 49:09.244
Estelle, this
isn't a strip club.

49:09.246 --> 49:11.145
If you say so honey.

49:11.147 --> 49:13.181
Most of them don't
care about money.

49:13.183 --> 49:15.851
And I don't think
they're gonna leave.

49:15.853 --> 49:17.286
Well that's where you come in.

49:17.288 --> 49:18.654
For a city to flourish,

49:18.656 --> 49:21.088
sometimes certain rights
have to be sacrificed

49:21.090 --> 49:23.458
under a little law
called eminent domain.

49:23.460 --> 49:25.694
It's your chance
to get grandma out

49:25.696 --> 49:27.031
and into a home.

49:29.199 --> 49:30.232
Estelle!

49:32.735 --> 49:35.904
Oh you cutie you.

49:35.906 --> 49:38.507
Yeah, it'd have to
be a really nice home.

49:38.509 --> 49:40.942
With really hot attendants.

49:40.944 --> 49:42.610
There's the ovaries.

49:42.612 --> 49:45.348
I think we need
some shots huh?

49:46.516 --> 49:47.983
You know I don't
want your shot.

49:47.985 --> 49:48.819
I'm sorry.

49:50.420 --> 49:51.989
Yeah or your money.

49:52.855 --> 49:54.188
I'm not doing this.

49:54.190 --> 49:55.958
Yeah, I'm not gonna do this.

49:55.960 --> 49:57.826
There is something
wrong with you.

49:57.828 --> 50:00.228
We can't do this without her.

50:00.230 --> 50:01.529
Well, then we're not doing it.

50:01.531 --> 50:02.365
Excuse me.

50:07.705 --> 50:08.538
Okay.

50:10.674 --> 50:11.672
Ouch, shit.

50:11.674 --> 50:13.708
What are you doing?

50:13.710 --> 50:15.043
I'm doing it my way.

50:15.045 --> 50:18.549
You lame ass, bitch
bribing, clit suckers!

50:23.353 --> 50:24.219
Do you want a ride?

50:24.221 --> 50:25.253
Sure.

50:25.255 --> 50:27.657
These guys are skanks anyway.

50:40.638 --> 50:43.672
Is something wrong
with your phone?

50:43.674 --> 50:44.806
We need to talk.

50:44.808 --> 50:47.108
Oh it's this guy.

50:47.110 --> 50:47.944
What?

50:48.846 --> 50:50.545
Where's Dave and Jeff?

50:50.547 --> 50:51.880
Well if I remember correctly,

50:51.882 --> 50:55.349
you gave Jeff six
weeks paternity leave

50:55.351 --> 50:58.420
and Dave I, you're the boss.

50:58.422 --> 50:59.587
Shit.

50:59.589 --> 51:00.521
And I'm...

51:00.523 --> 51:01.757
Just tell me one thing.

51:01.759 --> 51:05.295
Were you planning on
redeveloping Hillview?

51:06.496 --> 51:07.330
You were.

51:08.665 --> 51:10.065
I was pressured into it.

51:10.067 --> 51:11.266
Yeah.

51:11.268 --> 51:13.101
I was just offered
the same deal.

51:13.103 --> 51:15.337
And I'm not caving.

51:15.339 --> 51:16.904
Amanda I swear I
didn't know it would

51:16.906 --> 51:19.074
effect your grandmother.

51:19.076 --> 51:21.175
But you've lost sight
of getting home.

51:21.177 --> 51:23.578
After tomorrow the
mirror won't work.

51:23.580 --> 51:25.146
Have you even been
looking for it?

51:27.551 --> 51:28.483
Hello.

51:28.485 --> 51:29.750
Hey hot stuff.

51:29.752 --> 51:31.219
So Carol was doing a
cleanup in the alley

51:31.221 --> 51:33.954
behind Valley Cafe and I
think we found your mirror.

51:33.956 --> 51:34.792
Yes!

51:35.926 --> 51:36.824
I can't
believe she found it.

51:36.826 --> 51:38.059
I know, I know.

51:38.061 --> 51:39.293
Alright, as soon as
we get the mirror

51:39.295 --> 51:40.895
we're gonna go back
to Honker's, Pecker's

51:40.897 --> 51:42.563
and we're gonna recreate
everything about that night okay?

51:42.565 --> 51:43.399
Fine.

51:44.835 --> 51:45.666
Hey.

51:45.668 --> 51:46.500
Here it is sweetheart.

51:46.502 --> 51:47.668
Oh!

51:47.670 --> 51:49.137
Thank you so much.

51:49.139 --> 51:51.840
Now you can look
at your pretty face.

51:51.842 --> 51:53.741
This isn't the one.

51:53.743 --> 51:54.710
What are you talking about?

51:54.712 --> 51:56.011
That's the mirror, that's...

51:56.013 --> 51:57.244
It doesn't have the
key thing on the end,

51:57.246 --> 51:59.014
the handle is totally different.

51:59.016 --> 52:00.382
This isn't the one.

52:00.384 --> 52:01.817
For my sake I
was hoping it was.

52:01.819 --> 52:03.087
Thanks Penny.

52:09.359 --> 52:12.159
Well I hope you're happy.

52:12.161 --> 52:13.261
Honestly, I kind of am.

52:13.263 --> 52:14.496
I love it here.

52:14.498 --> 52:16.565
The world is a lot
better for me here.

52:16.567 --> 52:17.398
Is it, is it better?

52:17.400 --> 52:18.400
Yeah.

52:18.402 --> 52:19.134
You're turning
into an asshole.

52:19.136 --> 52:19.967
Really?!

52:19.969 --> 52:21.203
Yeah, a little bit.

52:21.205 --> 52:22.369
Because we've
been here six days

52:22.371 --> 52:23.170
things aren't
working out totally

52:23.172 --> 52:24.405
stacked in your favor.

52:24.407 --> 52:25.239
Things flip and
I'm the asshole?!

52:25.241 --> 52:26.407
Yeah okay.

52:26.409 --> 52:27.875
That's not what I meant.

52:27.877 --> 52:29.543
It is exactly what you meant.

52:29.545 --> 52:30.445
You know what, good luck.

52:30.447 --> 52:31.378
Good luck tomorrow.

52:31.380 --> 52:32.279
Oh good luck tomorrow?!

52:32.281 --> 52:33.782
Good luck to you.

52:33.784 --> 52:35.449
No, good luck to you!

52:35.451 --> 52:36.418
You can't
storm off when we're

52:36.420 --> 52:38.786
walking to the same place.

52:46.429 --> 52:49.029
Happy election day everyone.

52:49.031 --> 52:50.165
I'm glad you've
joined us for the

52:50.167 --> 52:52.534
Mayoral Fishing event.

52:52.536 --> 52:54.136
Anyone know where Maxwell is?

52:54.138 --> 52:56.706
No, who cares, let's do this.

53:00.110 --> 53:01.675
Excuse me.

53:01.677 --> 53:03.013
Excuse me folks.

53:04.848 --> 53:05.681
Dude.

53:10.788 --> 53:12.387
We're gonna get schooled.

53:12.389 --> 53:14.725
We're gonna be fine Marge.

53:16.659 --> 53:18.659
Don't do anything
stupid, we can still win.

53:18.661 --> 53:20.395
What's this we, I fired you.

53:20.397 --> 53:22.299
You can't, I own you.

53:23.933 --> 53:25.766
You've come prepared.

53:25.768 --> 53:28.270
A Mayor always comes prepared.

53:28.272 --> 53:29.237
You look dumb.

53:29.239 --> 53:30.471
Here we go!

53:30.473 --> 53:33.543
Which candidate will
be the best catch?

53:47.623 --> 53:48.924
Good.

53:48.926 --> 53:50.257
Thanks.

53:50.259 --> 53:52.159
How 'bout this fresh air folks!

53:52.161 --> 53:54.262
Too bad she's not
gonna catch any fish!

53:54.264 --> 53:57.866
Looks like we got ourselves
a competition folks!

53:57.868 --> 53:59.300
At least I've got my
priorities straight.

53:59.302 --> 54:00.802
You're in my world now honey.

54:00.804 --> 54:03.538
Aren't we supposed to
be keeping this friendly?

54:03.540 --> 54:05.005
At least I've got a
plan for the community.

54:05.007 --> 54:06.741
Oh you have plans?

54:06.743 --> 54:07.842
You have a plan
for the community?

54:07.844 --> 54:09.043
Yeah.

54:09.045 --> 54:09.978
Do you guys wanna
see what kind of

54:09.980 --> 54:11.846
planning skills Amanda has?

54:11.848 --> 54:13.581
Let's see it, allow me.

54:13.583 --> 54:16.284
Allow me to just, whoa!

54:16.286 --> 54:19.487
She's got a big giant fish
on the end of this line!

54:19.489 --> 54:21.288
Let's see here!

54:21.290 --> 54:22.124
Oh no!

54:23.560 --> 54:26.061
Forgot to bait the
hook, how embarrassing.

54:26.063 --> 54:27.128
Oh shit.

54:27.130 --> 54:28.329
Almost as
embarrassing as letting

54:28.331 --> 54:30.632
a man strip the
pole away from her!

54:30.634 --> 54:32.199
If she can't protect
her own fishing pole,

54:32.201 --> 54:36.605
how is she gonna protect the
residents of Ellensburg?!

54:36.607 --> 54:37.838
A lunatic, you
look like a lunatic.

54:37.840 --> 54:39.808
I'm gonna find
that magic mirror.

54:39.810 --> 54:44.512
And that I'm gonna Marty McFly
it out of here without you.

54:44.514 --> 54:46.350
Okay, that happened.

54:47.583 --> 54:49.317
Don't forget to vote folks

54:49.319 --> 54:52.721
and we'll see you at the
election party tonight.

54:54.590 --> 54:55.891
Oh dude!

54:55.893 --> 54:57.893
Remembered all of
this gear, forgot bait.

54:57.895 --> 54:59.494
No it's perfect, it's perfect

54:59.496 --> 55:01.929
because Bret looked like
an over emotional man.

55:01.931 --> 55:03.431
Right?

55:03.433 --> 55:04.766
And Marge caught the fish
but that's like whatever.

55:04.768 --> 55:06.867
You completely have
this in the bag.

55:06.869 --> 55:07.701
Yeah?

55:07.703 --> 55:08.637
Yeah.

55:08.639 --> 55:09.971
Hey, I can hear you guys.

55:09.973 --> 55:11.405
Sorry Marge.

55:11.407 --> 55:12.909
Are we still cool?

55:13.810 --> 55:15.076
Alright.

55:15.078 --> 55:16.344
She's cool.

55:26.089 --> 55:26.987
Thank you.

55:26.989 --> 55:28.523
Nat was right.

55:28.525 --> 55:30.858
You totally got this.

55:30.860 --> 55:32.427
Thanks.

55:32.429 --> 55:34.097
You seem stressed.

55:35.598 --> 55:36.432
May I?

55:42.605 --> 55:44.172
Don't worry.

55:44.174 --> 55:45.407
You're the favorite.

55:45.409 --> 55:48.610
And it's not like Bret
really had a chance.

55:48.612 --> 55:50.011
Why is that?

55:50.013 --> 55:51.478
It's gonna take
more than a few

55:51.480 --> 55:55.116
pretty yard signs for
this town to elect a man.

55:55.118 --> 55:56.483
That's ridiculous.

55:56.485 --> 55:58.719
It's whoever's best for the job.

55:58.721 --> 56:01.723
You're such a strong woman.

56:01.725 --> 56:04.659
And I love that about you.

56:04.661 --> 56:06.429
What are you doing?

56:10.199 --> 56:12.032
This isn't appropriate Rick.

56:12.034 --> 56:15.235
I wanna be more
than just your intern.

56:15.237 --> 56:17.038
Amanda, Amanda.

56:17.040 --> 56:18.005
I knew it.

56:18.007 --> 56:18.841
Okay.

56:20.210 --> 56:21.409
Dex.

56:21.411 --> 56:23.645
Hey I used to
babysit you, remember?

56:23.647 --> 56:24.648
Little slut.

56:25.549 --> 56:27.014
So, this is what it means

56:27.016 --> 56:29.817
when you have a meeting
or a dinner thing huh?

56:29.819 --> 56:30.851
No Dex.

56:30.853 --> 56:32.320
Typical woman.

56:32.322 --> 56:34.825
Selfish, all you want is dick.

56:40.364 --> 56:42.130
Dex!

56:42.132 --> 56:42.965
Dex.

57:00.583 --> 57:01.417
Come on!

57:07.623 --> 57:11.192
Yeah, it's definitely
the head gasket.

57:11.194 --> 57:12.027
No biggie.

57:12.029 --> 57:13.196
Torque wrench.

57:17.400 --> 57:20.569
The one that looks
like a Jedi weapon.

57:24.273 --> 57:26.507
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

57:26.509 --> 57:27.741
Are you crying?

57:27.743 --> 57:29.043
Yeah.

57:29.045 --> 57:30.047
Dude, why?

57:31.181 --> 57:33.449
I could use some comfort.

57:39.322 --> 57:40.788
Dex left me.

57:40.790 --> 57:42.056
That's it?

57:42.058 --> 57:43.824
Okay well let's go
get you some cock.

57:47.964 --> 57:52.032
I just need you to be
here with me right now.

57:52.034 --> 57:54.268
Look, maybe this is the
wake up call you need.

57:54.270 --> 57:55.203
What?!

57:55.205 --> 57:56.371
Amanda you're different.

57:56.373 --> 57:57.204
I'm different?

57:57.206 --> 57:59.040
Yeah you're different.

57:59.042 --> 58:02.277
This whole week you've
been dressing weird,

58:02.279 --> 58:04.311
wearing makeup like a boy.

58:04.313 --> 58:06.980
I'm not surprised
that Dex bailed.

58:06.982 --> 58:08.683
You'd rather discuss
a problem to death

58:08.685 --> 58:10.819
than actually fix it.

58:10.821 --> 58:14.991
You forgot what a freaking
light saber looks like!

58:16.393 --> 58:18.259
Is it this one?

58:20.630 --> 58:22.563
We're friends right?

58:22.565 --> 58:24.666
Tell me what's happening?!

58:24.668 --> 58:27.768
Oh my God, you
wouldn't understand.

58:27.770 --> 58:29.070
Ouch!

58:29.072 --> 58:30.404
Spit it out.

58:30.406 --> 58:31.338
I'm telling you it's...

58:31.340 --> 58:32.174
Ouch!

58:33.143 --> 58:35.576
Look I promise I'll be cool.

58:35.578 --> 58:37.480
Just tell me the truth.

58:38.815 --> 58:41.081
Are you a lesbian?

58:41.083 --> 58:41.916
No.

58:41.918 --> 58:42.750
No?

58:42.752 --> 58:43.585
No.

58:43.587 --> 58:44.853
Great.

58:44.855 --> 58:46.520
Stop it, you're
being an asshole!

58:46.522 --> 58:48.389
Okay, alright!

58:48.391 --> 58:50.224
That's more like it!

58:50.226 --> 58:54.027
It's good to see some of
the old you still in there.

58:54.029 --> 58:55.896
Okay okay fine,
you wanna know?

58:55.898 --> 58:57.398
You wanna know what happened?

58:57.400 --> 58:59.000
It's gonna sound insane but I
will tell you what happened.

58:59.002 --> 59:00.902
Yeah please.

59:00.904 --> 59:03.137
Alright, apparently I
found an old magical mirror

59:03.139 --> 59:05.139
and it sent me
here to this world

59:05.141 --> 59:06.474
where things are backwards.

59:06.476 --> 59:08.842
Where the women act
like men and vice versa.

59:08.844 --> 59:10.078
And you're sure it's not some

59:10.080 --> 59:12.579
old magical crack
that you found?

59:12.581 --> 59:14.449
Bret and I are the only
ones who are the same.

59:14.451 --> 59:17.251
You and everyone else
are totally different.

59:17.253 --> 59:19.387
And it's like, if
I stay here then,

59:19.389 --> 59:21.956
I have a higher likelihood
of becoming Mayor

59:21.958 --> 59:23.391
and then I could
help my grandma.

59:23.393 --> 59:25.759
I could actually do
something to protect her.

59:25.761 --> 59:27.628
But the whole world
here is like confusing

59:27.630 --> 59:29.630
and it's not exactly
what I wished for.

59:29.632 --> 59:31.065
I told you it was
gonna sound insane,

59:31.067 --> 59:32.132
I told you it was
gonna sound crazy.

59:32.134 --> 59:33.333
Amanda...

59:33.335 --> 59:34.001
You said you
wanted to hear it.

59:34.003 --> 59:34.936
Amanda.

59:34.938 --> 59:37.204
I've always had your back.

59:37.206 --> 59:38.405
Right.

59:38.407 --> 59:40.842
And it's bullshit
that you can't be honest

59:40.844 --> 59:41.742
with me right now.

59:41.744 --> 59:42.976
Nat wait!

59:42.978 --> 59:44.212
No, woman up and
solve your shit!

59:44.214 --> 59:47.181
Or maybe you can talk
your truck into working.

59:47.183 --> 59:49.016
Okay, I was telling
the truth Nat.

59:49.018 --> 59:50.018
Yeah whatever.

59:50.020 --> 59:50.851
Hey!

59:50.853 --> 59:52.254
Whatever!

59:55.592 --> 59:57.090
Oh my God.

59:57.092 --> 59:58.592
Hey grandma, it's really
not a good time right now.

59:58.594 --> 01:00:00.962
Get
your ass over here.

01:00:00.964 --> 01:00:02.596
I'm wounded.

01:00:02.598 --> 01:00:03.831
What?

01:00:03.833 --> 01:00:06.166
It's like
I'm bleeding pretty bad.

01:00:06.168 --> 01:00:07.634
Okay, did you call 9-1-1?

01:00:07.636 --> 01:00:11.838
Yup, but
they haven't responded.

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:13.109
Okay grandma,

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:15.944
my truck isn't working
but I'm coming.

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:18.346
I'm gonna be right
there, I'm coming.

01:00:18.348 --> 01:00:20.815
Just
hurry up damnit!

01:00:20.817 --> 01:00:21.885
Shit, shit!

01:00:24.654 --> 01:00:25.485
Hey.

01:00:25.487 --> 01:00:26.320
Hello.

01:00:26.322 --> 01:00:27.255
Hey, I need your help.

01:00:27.257 --> 01:00:29.623
What do you want?

01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:31.960
Listen, I need a favor okay.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:33.594
Bitch please.

01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:36.730
Are you?

01:00:36.732 --> 01:00:38.299
Where are you, are you drunk?

01:00:39.603 --> 01:00:41.938
Why don't I walk you home?

01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:46.206
I know these tactics.

01:00:46.208 --> 01:00:47.476
I've used them.

01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:50.480
Ugh, I'm the girl.

01:00:52.514 --> 01:00:53.616
I'm the girl.

01:00:56.118 --> 01:00:57.552
Hey Sally, take a hike.

01:00:57.554 --> 01:00:59.119
Dude.

01:00:59.121 --> 01:01:00.788
He's not gonna put out anyway.

01:01:00.790 --> 01:01:01.723
He's a little...

01:01:01.725 --> 01:01:02.857
Mental, got it, thanks.

01:01:02.859 --> 01:01:04.259
You saved me.

01:01:04.261 --> 01:01:05.960
Awesome, it's an
emergency, I need a ride.

01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:07.128
I'm in no condition to drive.

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:09.063
I drank all these drinks.

01:01:09.065 --> 01:01:12.032
Compliments of the sexist
bitches, they're really good.

01:01:12.034 --> 01:01:13.601
Cool, I'll drive.

01:01:13.603 --> 01:01:15.605
I don't have my truck.

01:01:16.572 --> 01:01:18.105
I have a car now.

01:01:18.107 --> 01:01:18.940
I love it.

01:01:18.942 --> 01:01:19.873
Don't.

01:01:19.875 --> 01:01:20.708
I really love it.

01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:22.309
Shut up.

01:01:22.311 --> 01:01:23.313
I love it.

01:01:37.092 --> 01:01:38.860
You think she's alright?

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:39.863
I hope so.

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:47.768
Oh my God I hate
this place so much.

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:49.938
I hate it, I hate it here.

01:01:52.708 --> 01:01:55.610
And you have everything
you've ever wanted.

01:01:55.612 --> 01:01:57.045
My God, this is
not what I wanted.

01:01:57.047 --> 01:01:59.313
Oh yeah, you must be suffering

01:01:59.315 --> 01:02:02.418
with all the rules
bent in your favor.

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:06.788
Are you okay?

01:02:06.790 --> 01:02:07.623
No.

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:09.891
No I'm not.

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:11.759
I'm not okay.

01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:14.329
No one thinks I can do anything.

01:02:14.331 --> 01:02:17.831
And it's not the
harassment and the groping.

01:02:17.833 --> 01:02:21.768
'Cause that was fun
for a little while.

01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:24.072
It's the fact that

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:27.177
no one listens to
what I have to say.

01:02:28.310 --> 01:02:29.944
That's how you feel
after only a week?

01:02:29.946 --> 01:02:30.911
Oh stop.

01:02:30.913 --> 01:02:32.179
Don't do that.

01:02:32.181 --> 01:02:33.246
Don't, don't.

01:02:33.248 --> 01:02:36.616
Don't turn it into a thing okay.

01:02:36.618 --> 01:02:39.621
All this is a
complete exaggeration.

01:02:41.357 --> 01:02:43.025
Trust me it's not.

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:26.433
Oh my God, Nat found it!

01:03:26.435 --> 01:03:27.268
How?!

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:28.770
I don't know.

01:03:28.772 --> 01:03:30.304
Well call her!

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:32.139
We're kind of having a thing.

01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:34.141
What do you mean
you're having a thing?

01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:35.375
Are you serious?

01:03:35.377 --> 01:03:36.309
No, I know.

01:03:36.311 --> 01:03:37.578
You're just dragging your feet

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.413
'cause you wanna stay
in your little world

01:03:39.415 --> 01:03:41.382
of puppies and rainbows.

01:03:41.384 --> 01:03:42.719
I'm calling her.

01:03:44.186 --> 01:03:45.786
What's up hymen head?

01:03:45.788 --> 01:03:47.154
Hey Nat.

01:03:47.156 --> 01:03:49.590
Oh wow, she's
already making move.

01:03:49.592 --> 01:03:51.458
Listen, the mirror
that you found,

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:53.527
where did you find it exactly?

01:03:53.529 --> 01:03:55.429
Chill, it's at Howells.

01:03:55.431 --> 01:03:57.898
Okay, well this
is very important.

01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:59.933
We need you to buy
it, we need it.

01:03:59.935 --> 01:04:04.371
Yeah I'd imagine, magic mirrors
are hard to come by right?

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:06.440
You told
her it was magic?

01:04:06.442 --> 01:04:07.407
Gotta go!

01:04:07.409 --> 01:04:09.342
Wait Nat, wait, wait, wait!

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:11.813
Okay we need to turn around.

01:04:11.815 --> 01:04:12.913
We need to turn around
and get back to Howell's

01:04:12.915 --> 01:04:13.848
before they.

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:15.349
What, your grandmother said

01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:18.219
that if the mirror won't
work after 10:02 tonight!

01:04:18.221 --> 01:04:19.487
My grandma is hurt okay!

01:04:19.489 --> 01:04:21.057
She needs our help!

01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:27.630
Yeah okay you're right.

01:04:28.565 --> 01:04:29.566
Thank you.

01:04:54.156 --> 01:04:54.989
Grandma?!

01:04:54.991 --> 01:04:56.257
I'm okay.

01:04:56.259 --> 01:04:58.159
Don't be freaking
out on me here.

01:04:58.161 --> 01:05:01.061
I won't, I won't, let me see.

01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:02.329
That's a lot of blood.

01:05:02.331 --> 01:05:05.233
I'm pathetic, they got
me with my own damn gun.

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:08.034
We just need to
get you out of here.

01:05:08.036 --> 01:05:10.137
Are you still having fun?

01:05:10.139 --> 01:05:11.672
What?

01:05:11.674 --> 01:05:15.442
One day I'll tell you
about my own adventure.

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:17.043
Okay.

01:05:17.045 --> 01:05:18.545
Oh, we gotta get
her to the hospital.

01:05:18.547 --> 01:05:20.449
Can you stand?

01:05:21.951 --> 01:05:23.483
Oh.

01:05:23.485 --> 01:05:25.186
Oh, you know what sugar.

01:05:25.188 --> 01:05:29.056
You're a lot prettier
when you smile.

01:05:29.058 --> 01:05:29.893
Okay.

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:40.168
She's stable.

01:05:44.107 --> 01:05:45.105
I don't know what
I would have done

01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:47.775
if she hadn't made it.

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:50.645
Yeah but she did make
it, she's stable right?

01:05:50.647 --> 01:05:53.346
I just can't
stop thinking like,

01:05:53.348 --> 01:05:55.483
what if this is happening like

01:05:55.485 --> 01:05:57.387
in the old world and I,

01:05:58.453 --> 01:06:00.989
I won't be able to protect her.

01:06:02.424 --> 01:06:04.358
We're running out of time.

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:05.293
I know.

01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:07.295
We have to go, we have to go.

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:08.795
Less then 10 minutes until

01:06:08.797 --> 01:06:11.866
Ellenburg's next Mayor is
announced here at town hall.

01:06:11.868 --> 01:06:13.701
So if you get a
chance, come down

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:16.538
and check out the
exciting finish.

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:20.275
I need to know.

01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:24.210
We have to get the mirror.

01:06:24.212 --> 01:06:25.579
I'm sorry.

01:06:25.581 --> 01:06:27.081
Forget it.

01:06:27.083 --> 01:06:30.820
I'm getting out of this
world with or without you.

01:06:51.708 --> 01:06:52.542
No.

01:06:58.614 --> 01:06:59.980
What do you mean it's gone?

01:06:59.982 --> 01:07:00.947
Someone bought it?

01:07:00.949 --> 01:07:01.783
Who?

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:04.552
It's time to announce.

01:07:04.554 --> 01:07:07.721
Hey, the woman of
the hour made it.

01:07:07.723 --> 01:07:10.891
Our new Mayor Amanda Maxwell.

01:07:10.893 --> 01:07:12.192
Oh hell.

01:07:17.433 --> 01:07:19.701
You're still certifiable.

01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:21.738
Thanks Nat.

01:07:23.906 --> 01:07:27.677
Thank you so much everyone
for supporting me.

01:07:28.844 --> 01:07:32.581
I'm so grateful for a
system that's free of...

01:07:36.585 --> 01:07:38.251
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

01:07:38.253 --> 01:07:39.589
I can't do this.

01:07:40.623 --> 01:07:41.724
I didn't win.

01:07:42.659 --> 01:07:43.491
Judy and Ruth did.

01:07:43.493 --> 01:07:45.395
Your votes were bought.

01:07:46.561 --> 01:07:49.262
I wanna win this on
my own or not at all.

01:07:49.264 --> 01:07:51.032
Let's get out of here.

01:07:51.034 --> 01:07:51.866
Hey.

01:07:51.868 --> 01:07:52.699
Yeah.

01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:53.534
Nat's got it.

01:07:53.536 --> 01:07:54.367
You do?!

01:07:54.369 --> 01:07:55.969
What?

01:07:55.971 --> 01:07:57.038
What this?

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:57.871
That's it.

01:07:57.873 --> 01:07:58.806
Oh God.

01:07:58.808 --> 01:07:59.739
Hey that's Bret's mirror.

01:07:59.741 --> 01:08:01.007
The one we've been looking for.

01:08:01.009 --> 01:08:02.509
Probably why he hasn't
been doing his makeup.

01:08:02.511 --> 01:08:03.444
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

01:08:03.446 --> 01:08:04.445
say that again?

01:08:04.447 --> 01:08:05.945
What?

01:08:05.947 --> 01:08:06.880
That after you give his
girlfriend back his mirror

01:08:06.882 --> 01:08:08.849
we can go grab some cosmos?

01:08:08.851 --> 01:08:10.650
Who the hell are you?

01:08:10.652 --> 01:08:12.286
You know what Sheriff
we got this I think.

01:08:12.288 --> 01:08:13.623
If you say so.

01:08:14.723 --> 01:08:16.223
It's what I've
been telling you Nat.

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:17.625
We need it.

01:08:17.627 --> 01:08:19.260
Oh my God, this is...

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:20.193
We have like eight minutes.

01:08:20.194 --> 01:08:21.461
We need to get to Pecker's.

01:08:21.462 --> 01:08:22.930
But what's gonna
happen when you...

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:25.765
Listen, I promise
you're gonna be fine okay.

01:08:25.767 --> 01:08:27.399
I just want you to
know you've made me

01:08:27.402 --> 01:08:30.904
a much stronger person and
I'm gonna miss the new you.

01:08:30.906 --> 01:08:31.872
This is nonsense.

01:08:31.874 --> 01:08:34.241
No, it's a nuclear artifact.

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:35.542
Marge, back off!

01:08:35.544 --> 01:08:36.743
Hey, let go!

01:08:36.745 --> 01:08:38.243
It's the Hanford smugglers!

01:08:38.246 --> 01:08:39.113
Shut up Marge!

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:39.947
Got the mirror!

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:40.779
Punch you!

01:08:40.782 --> 01:08:42.618
You can't, love hug!

01:08:45.254 --> 01:08:46.519
Amanda, let's go!

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:47.252
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

01:08:47.255 --> 01:08:48.287
Are you okay?

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:50.024
Quarantine the area!

01:08:50.026 --> 01:08:50.890
Marge.

01:08:50.892 --> 01:08:52.493
Marge just...

01:08:55.831 --> 01:08:57.863
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:08:57.866 --> 01:08:58.700
Holy Shit!

01:09:01.437 --> 01:09:02.935
Holy Shit!

01:09:07.642 --> 01:09:09.274
Oh my God.

01:09:09.277 --> 01:09:10.279
Oh my God.

01:09:13.014 --> 01:09:15.649
Hey, for what it's
worth, congrats on the win.

01:09:15.651 --> 01:09:16.486
Thanks.

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:23.524
You know, if we get back,

01:09:23.526 --> 01:09:25.457
you might not get the chance.

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:27.327
Yeah I know.

01:09:27.328 --> 01:09:28.595
You know what I'm
willing to try.

01:09:28.596 --> 01:09:32.100
I mean, the system is
just as corrupt here.

01:09:36.438 --> 01:09:38.941
Hey, when we get back let's,

01:09:40.243 --> 01:09:42.274
let's try to make things better.

01:09:42.277 --> 01:09:43.844
Did you hit your head?

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:49.015
So I have a confession to make.

01:09:49.017 --> 01:09:50.050
Uh oh.

01:09:50.051 --> 01:09:51.551
Yeah.

01:09:51.553 --> 01:09:55.088
I've been saving up my money
to start my own business.

01:09:55.090 --> 01:09:56.290
To compete with me?

01:09:56.292 --> 01:09:57.123
Yeah.

01:09:57.125 --> 01:09:59.193
I'm impressed.

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:02.296
But I was thinking
I'd rather...

01:10:02.298 --> 01:10:04.765
How would you feel
about having a partner?

01:10:04.767 --> 01:10:06.500
You wanna buy in?

01:10:06.502 --> 01:10:07.335
50, 50.

01:10:11.807 --> 01:10:12.773
Alright.

01:10:12.775 --> 01:10:13.607
Whoa!

01:10:14.442 --> 01:10:15.775
I'm sorry, sorry.

01:10:15.777 --> 01:10:18.045
I almost pulled a
Mayor Gleason on us.

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:21.614
Well, one big
difference but yeah.

01:10:23.585 --> 01:10:24.885
Oh come on, really?

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:26.086
Step on it!

01:10:26.088 --> 01:10:26.753
Alright, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:10:27.589 --> 01:10:28.488
Really?

01:10:33.195 --> 01:10:34.228
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:35.964
I'm going!

01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:40.736
Hi, welcome to
Pecker's, hello.

01:10:42.538 --> 01:10:43.770
We were both holding it.

01:10:43.772 --> 01:10:44.604
Okay.

01:10:44.606 --> 01:10:45.939
Alright so just say it.

01:10:45.941 --> 01:10:47.608
Alright, I wish for
our old life back.

01:10:47.610 --> 01:10:48.842
I wish it too.

01:10:51.746 --> 01:10:53.113
Oh, we were holding
it to that thing.

01:10:53.115 --> 01:10:54.415
Right!

01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:55.248
Okay you ready?

01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:56.082
Amanda!

01:10:56.084 --> 01:10:57.318
Nat?!

01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.152
I'm not gonna
lose my best friend!

01:10:58.154 --> 01:10:59.052
No, no, no.

01:11:00.021 --> 01:11:00.954
Don't!

01:11:00.956 --> 01:11:01.958
Don't do it!

01:11:09.764 --> 01:11:10.730
Are we back?

01:11:10.732 --> 01:11:12.000
I don't know.

01:11:22.911 --> 01:11:24.811
Oh thank God.

01:11:24.813 --> 01:11:25.914
Oh thank God.

01:11:27.883 --> 01:11:29.384
Are you serious?

01:11:31.152 --> 01:11:32.752
Whoa?

01:11:32.754 --> 01:11:33.588
Wait.

01:11:38.794 --> 01:11:39.795
Oh my God.

01:11:40.829 --> 01:11:42.163
This is amazing.

01:11:43.031 --> 01:11:44.699
Oh what's amazing?

01:11:46.002 --> 01:11:46.835
Nat?

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:52.805
Are you okay?

01:11:52.807 --> 01:11:55.977
Yeah, what, are
we in a lesbian bar?

01:11:59.115 --> 01:12:01.180
You're still flipped.

01:12:01.182 --> 01:12:02.549
She was holding
the mirror with us

01:12:02.551 --> 01:12:03.550
when we.

01:12:03.552 --> 01:12:04.887
Wait, oh my God.

01:12:08.290 --> 01:12:10.058
It's broken, I don't,

01:12:11.227 --> 01:12:13.260
I don't know how we're
gonna get you back.

01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:14.163
Whatever.

01:12:15.298 --> 01:12:16.796
I'll just stay here
and shake things

01:12:16.798 --> 01:12:18.400
up with you chumps.

01:12:19.768 --> 01:12:20.967
Okay well listen,

01:12:20.969 --> 01:12:23.903
it's gonna be really
weird for you out there

01:12:23.905 --> 01:12:25.706
so you might puke.

01:12:25.708 --> 01:12:27.207
Or pee your pants.

01:12:27.209 --> 01:12:28.676
Or like queef.

01:12:28.678 --> 01:12:30.610
But definitely something's
coming out of my body

01:12:30.612 --> 01:12:34.247
is what you're telling
me right now right?

01:12:34.249 --> 01:12:36.250
Are those fake boobs?

01:12:36.252 --> 01:12:37.117
Yeah.

01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:38.652
Why?

01:12:38.654 --> 01:12:40.723
We'll go over it later.

01:12:43.159 --> 01:12:44.257
Hey Dex.

01:12:44.259 --> 01:12:45.261
Dex wake up.

01:12:47.195 --> 01:12:48.028
Are we home?

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:49.395
No.

01:12:49.397 --> 01:12:50.764
I am.

01:12:50.766 --> 01:12:53.035
Listen, this isn't working.

01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:57.438
We're not a match in any world.

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:58.540
Amanda I...

01:13:00.375 --> 01:13:01.944
I'm gonna throw up!

01:13:06.749 --> 01:13:08.584
What is up with Dex?

01:13:09.919 --> 01:13:12.485
I think we need to
introduce you to Louisburg.

01:13:12.487 --> 01:13:13.653
Yeah?

01:13:13.655 --> 01:13:14.822
Show me what you got.

01:13:14.824 --> 01:13:16.556
Hey listen, been
thinking a lot about the

01:13:16.558 --> 01:13:18.559
whole paternity leave thing.

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:20.295
I wanna do it for ya.

01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:23.630
I wanna make it as
long as possible.

01:13:23.632 --> 01:13:24.564
Really?

01:13:24.566 --> 01:13:25.299
Yeah, you deserve it man.

01:13:25.301 --> 01:13:26.500
Thank you.

01:13:26.502 --> 01:13:27.935
Absolutely, I
genuinely mean that.

01:13:27.937 --> 01:13:30.970
Give me one second boys
I gotta go do something.

01:13:30.972 --> 01:13:32.374
Hey everyone, hi.

01:13:33.575 --> 01:13:35.576
I just wanted to thank
you all for coming out

01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:38.011
and supporting me tonight.

01:13:38.013 --> 01:13:39.779
This is gonna
sound really weird,

01:13:39.781 --> 01:13:42.649
but I've had a
very transformative

01:13:42.651 --> 01:13:44.754
last five or six minutes.

01:13:45.987 --> 01:13:47.653
And I've had a bit
of a change of heart.

01:13:47.655 --> 01:13:50.123
And a change of clothes.

01:13:50.125 --> 01:13:51.960
And I've realized that

01:13:54.663 --> 01:13:56.430
I can't be your Mayor.

01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:57.698
What?

01:13:57.700 --> 01:13:59.099
Yeah, I can't be your Mayor

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:00.400
because I've found
someone who's better

01:14:00.402 --> 01:14:03.002
suited for the position.

01:14:03.004 --> 01:14:05.538
She's determined, she's honest,

01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:08.007
and she's gonna take
this town by the balls.

01:14:08.009 --> 01:14:10.844
So I hope you can
all stand behind me

01:14:10.846 --> 01:14:14.250
in giving your support
to Amanda Maxwell.

01:14:15.217 --> 01:14:20.186
Get up there Maxwell.

01:14:20.188 --> 01:14:22.122
Let's see it.

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:23.290
Thank you Bret.

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:25.259
Wow, those are really kind words

01:14:25.261 --> 01:14:27.293
from someone that
I've gotten to know

01:14:27.295 --> 01:14:30.963
better than I ever
thought I would want to.

01:14:30.965 --> 01:14:32.832
Said with love.

01:14:32.834 --> 01:14:34.033
If I'm elected your Mayor

01:14:34.035 --> 01:14:35.868
I will work with
the City Council

01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:38.505
to hire Bret Johnson
as our City Manager.

01:14:38.507 --> 01:14:41.207
Because he'd be great at that.

01:14:42.244 --> 01:14:43.443
Nice.

01:14:43.445 --> 01:14:44.877
Because if there's
one thing I've learned,

01:14:44.879 --> 01:14:48.383
it's that behind every
great woman there is a man.

01:14:49.584 --> 01:14:51.217
Staring at her ass.

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:02.762
So are you happy with
how the new Mayor

01:15:02.764 --> 01:15:05.265
has been taking
care of Hillview?

01:15:05.267 --> 01:15:08.734
A lot better than the way
she took care of my mirror.

01:15:08.736 --> 01:15:09.569
Sorry.

01:15:09.571 --> 01:15:11.406
Oh that's okay dear.

01:15:12.708 --> 01:15:14.241
Grandma,

01:15:14.243 --> 01:15:16.443
it was really fun seeing
you in the other dimension

01:15:16.445 --> 01:15:17.377
I have to say.

01:15:17.379 --> 01:15:19.512
Oh really, what did I do?

01:15:19.514 --> 01:15:21.448
Oh you know,
cuss like a sailor.

01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:22.649
Oh my goodness.

01:15:22.651 --> 01:15:25.586
Tried to sleep with
every man I know.

01:15:28.124 --> 01:15:29.625
Yeah, it was cool.

01:15:30.793 --> 01:15:31.958
Are you gonna
dig this up again

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.628
in another 30 years?

01:15:34.963 --> 01:15:37.463
Maybe we won't have to.
