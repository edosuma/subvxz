00:13.723 --> 00:16.492
I don't want to see either
one of you ever again.

00:16.559 --> 00:18.026
Do we have a deal or not?

00:18.094 --> 00:20.896
<i>Yeah, we got a deal.</i>

00:22.198 --> 00:23.132
I'm going after him.

00:23.199 --> 00:24.133
We're done.

00:24.200 --> 00:25.667
We're just getting started.

00:25.735 --> 00:28.437
(grunts in pain)

00:28.505 --> 00:29.772
Jenny!

00:29.839 --> 00:32.107
(gunshots)

00:32.174 --> 00:33.175
(groans)

00:34.577 --> 00:37.179
We need to talk about
you having Tarin arrested.

00:37.247 --> 00:39.348
I know you consider
Tarin a friend.

00:39.416 --> 00:40.816
We are more than friends.

00:40.884 --> 00:43.118
<i>We're in love.</i>

00:43.186 --> 00:46.255
You've been carrying
on with this man...

00:46.322 --> 00:47.790
behind my back?

00:47.857 --> 00:49.792
Who are these men, Samir?

00:49.859 --> 00:51.026
These are men I
have recruited.

00:51.094 --> 00:53.195
We can't get the rods
out of the country,

00:53.263 --> 00:55.330
so let's use them as
a radiological bomb.

00:55.398 --> 00:58.834
<i>Then we'll show the
Americans how strong we are.</i>

01:00.770 --> 01:01.703
(grunts)

01:01.771 --> 01:03.071
(groans)

01:03.139 --> 01:04.072
Samir!

01:04.140 --> 01:05.274
Over here!

01:06.342 --> 01:07.543
There are people chasing me.

01:07.610 --> 01:09.077
They have the rods
you are looking for.

01:09.145 --> 01:10.345
I thought you had the rods.

01:10.413 --> 01:12.381
They turned against me.

01:12.449 --> 01:13.649
Just get me out of here.

01:13.716 --> 01:15.017
We'll get you out, Mr. Hassan.

01:15.084 --> 01:16.485
MAN: When things get
this colossally screwed up

01:16.553 --> 01:18.754
people look for
someone to blame.

01:18.822 --> 01:20.689
<i>HASTINGS: So what
have you got in mind?</i>

01:20.757 --> 01:22.691
Renee Walker- she killed
one of our main leads.

01:22.759 --> 01:24.359
You're talking about a
woman who put her life

01:24.427 --> 01:25.861
on the line when
she didn't have to.

01:25.929 --> 01:27.529
Well, someone has to
pay for this, Brian.

01:27.597 --> 01:30.332
I'm sending someone over
from Justice- Kristin Smith.

01:30.400 --> 01:31.967
She'll take care
of everything.

01:32.035 --> 01:35.337
They're setting you up-
don't say another word.

01:35.405 --> 01:37.239
It's too late.

01:37.307 --> 01:39.174
This is over.
We're leaving now.

01:39.242 --> 01:40.175
Hands in the air.

01:40.243 --> 01:41.477
Do it now!

01:41.544 --> 01:43.312
<i>HASTINGS: You offering</i>

01:43.379 --> 01:44.913
to bring in Farhad? Yes.

01:44.981 --> 01:48.350
If you drop the criminal
investigation against Renee Walker.

01:48.418 --> 01:51.553
If we do this, Jack, it's
not for one rescue operation,

01:51.621 --> 01:53.021
it's till this whole thing

01:53.089 --> 01:55.090
is over and done.

01:56.426 --> 01:57.793
Deal.

02:11.808 --> 02:13.909
We're about to transport
him to the embassy.

02:13.977 --> 02:15.577
You have two minutes.

02:15.645 --> 02:17.112
Thank you.

02:21.684 --> 02:24.219
Bashir, clear the room.

02:24.287 --> 02:26.889
Tarin, did they hurt you?

02:26.956 --> 02:28.390
Not yet.

02:28.458 --> 02:30.726
They won't until they
get me to our embassy.

02:30.793 --> 02:32.494
I tried to reason
with my father,

02:32.562 --> 02:33.962
but he wouldn't listen.

02:34.030 --> 02:37.399
He thinks you're involved in
the conspiracy with his brother.

02:37.467 --> 02:40.869
Even after I told him about
us, he doesn't trust you.

02:40.937 --> 02:42.437
You told him about us?

02:42.505 --> 02:44.540
I hoped it would
change his mind.

02:44.607 --> 02:48.043
But if anything, it's made
things worse between us.

02:49.512 --> 02:51.513
(whispers): Come closer.

02:56.119 --> 02:58.053
Listen to me, Kayla,

02:58.121 --> 02:59.488
there is a way out of this.

02:59.556 --> 03:02.391
There are a few men still loyal
to me- Bashir is one of them.

03:02.458 --> 03:05.594
He's agreed to help me escape.

03:05.662 --> 03:07.829
As soon as he's able, Bashir
will slip me a handcuff key,

03:07.897 --> 03:10.065
and he's placed a gun in
the car for me to find.

03:10.133 --> 03:11.099
You won't hurt anyone?

03:11.167 --> 03:13.035
The gun is so I won't have to.

03:13.102 --> 03:15.337
Once I'm free, I
have a place to stay

03:15.405 --> 03:16.872
until the Americans
grant me asylum.

03:16.940 --> 03:20.342
Kayla... I want
you to come with me.

03:20.410 --> 03:23.278
Meet me at the Teodore Hotel.

03:23.346 --> 03:25.280
Promise me you'll come.

03:25.348 --> 03:26.448
(door opens)

03:26.516 --> 03:28.517
Tarin, we need to go.

03:32.822 --> 03:34.823
(handcuffs rattling)

03:42.865 --> 03:45.000
(crickets chirping)

03:46.769 --> 03:47.803
(grunting)

03:47.870 --> 03:50.706
Cole, he's dead!

03:50.773 --> 03:52.274
Just go.

03:52.342 --> 03:54.343
(panting): What?

03:54.410 --> 03:55.644
Just go.

03:55.712 --> 03:58.313
Nobody knows you had
anything to do with this.

03:58.381 --> 03:59.848
It's my fault.

03:59.916 --> 04:01.383
I lied about everything.

04:01.451 --> 04:04.019
Who I am, what I've done.

04:04.087 --> 04:06.688
I'll call the police.

04:06.756 --> 04:09.858
I deserve to take
the blame for this.

04:09.926 --> 04:12.928
(panting)

04:17.800 --> 04:19.267
What's done is done.

04:19.334 --> 04:20.736
We're cleaning this up,

04:20.803 --> 04:22.704
and no one's ever gonna
know what happened.

04:22.772 --> 04:24.272
I don't want you involved.

04:24.340 --> 04:25.707
I'm already involved.

04:25.775 --> 04:29.745
We're gonna strip down his
van so it can't be I.D.'d.

04:29.812 --> 04:32.314
We'll dump the
bodies in the swamp.

04:32.382 --> 04:35.417
Hey. Hey!

04:35.485 --> 04:38.520
They're scum, Dana, and
no one's gonna miss 'em.

04:38.588 --> 04:41.857
You want to go to prison for
the rest of your life? For them?!

04:41.924 --> 04:43.492
Get started on the van.

04:43.559 --> 04:45.794
I'll go get the other one.

04:45.862 --> 04:47.863
(sniffling)

04:50.967 --> 04:52.901
PATTY (over intercom): Mr. Hastings,
the president's on the line.

04:52.969 --> 04:55.203
Thank you. This is Hastings.

04:55.271 --> 04:56.938
Mr. Hastings, I'm
here with Rob Weiss.

04:57.006 --> 04:58.640
I was told you
have urgent news.

04:58.708 --> 04:59.741
Yes, ma'am.

04:59.809 --> 05:01.877
We received a call
from Farhad Hassan.

05:01.944 --> 05:02.944
Farhad?

05:03.012 --> 05:04.613
Yes. As we suspected,
he was trying

05:04.681 --> 05:07.282
to smuggle the nuclear
rods out of the country.

05:07.350 --> 05:10.085
The people he's working
with have turned against him.

05:10.153 --> 05:12.421
What do we know?
Well, Farhad believes

05:12.488 --> 05:14.956
they want to use the rods
to construct a dirty bomb

05:15.024 --> 05:17.159
and set it off somewhere
here in New York City.

05:17.226 --> 05:19.161
Why would they do this?

05:19.228 --> 05:21.229
Between Hassan's
crackdowns and CTU,

05:21.297 --> 05:23.065
we've backed them
into a corner.

05:23.132 --> 05:24.733
This is their response.

05:24.801 --> 05:26.068
Do you believe him?

05:26.135 --> 05:27.335
Yes, I do.

05:27.403 --> 05:28.870
Farhad is turning himself in.

05:28.938 --> 05:31.273
He's agreed to help
us prevent this attack.

05:31.340 --> 05:32.474
Where is Farhad now?

05:32.542 --> 05:33.608
He's in a warehouse

05:33.676 --> 05:35.577
just outside the city
near Forest Hills.

05:35.645 --> 05:38.113
I've enlisted Jack
Bauer to lock him down.

05:38.181 --> 05:39.181
Now, Madam President,

05:39.248 --> 05:40.949
the men who turned
against Farhad

05:41.017 --> 05:43.151
are covert assets
for the I.R.K.

05:43.219 --> 05:44.820
Now, if we can get access

05:44.887 --> 05:46.955
to the I.R.K.
intelligence files,

05:47.023 --> 05:49.791
Farhad may be able to
help us I.D. these men.

05:49.859 --> 05:51.560
It will put us
that much closer

05:51.627 --> 05:54.663
to tracking them down. Those
files are the lifeblood of Hassan's

05:54.731 --> 05:56.665
intelligence operation-
he'll never hand them over.

05:56.733 --> 05:58.633
Especially in his
current frame of mind.

05:58.701 --> 06:00.168
Hell, the man's gone
off the deep end.

06:00.236 --> 06:02.771
Well, maybe this will
pull him out of it.

06:02.839 --> 06:03.939
Tell Hassan we have

06:04.006 --> 06:06.007
found his brother and
I need to speak to him

06:06.075 --> 06:07.008
immediately.

06:07.076 --> 06:08.009
And contact

06:08.077 --> 06:09.411
Tim Woods at Homeland.

06:09.479 --> 06:10.746
Have him put
together a briefing.

06:10.813 --> 06:12.781
<i>I need to exactly
what we're facing</i>

06:12.849 --> 06:15.484
if, God forbid,
this attack happens.

06:15.551 --> 06:17.018
Thank you, Mr. Hastings.

06:17.086 --> 06:18.520
I'll be in the
counsel chamber.

06:18.588 --> 06:20.422
Yes, Madam President.

06:21.758 --> 06:23.859
HASTINGS (over
intercom): Mr. Weiss.

06:23.926 --> 06:24.960
Yeah?

06:25.027 --> 06:25.994
Are we alone?

06:26.062 --> 06:27.095
Yeah. What is it?

06:28.431 --> 06:31.633
I want to let you
know that I've decided

06:31.701 --> 06:33.969
not to pursue charges
against Renee Walker.

06:34.036 --> 06:35.170
What?

06:35.238 --> 06:37.172
Why not? I told you...

06:37.240 --> 06:38.907
We have a lot
more to worry about

06:38.975 --> 06:40.142
right now than blaming Walker.

06:40.209 --> 06:41.610
Walker murdered
a valuable lead

06:41.677 --> 06:43.979
that might have gotten
us to those nuclear rods.

06:44.046 --> 06:45.480
You're not hearing me.

06:45.548 --> 06:48.083
We have a new lead
now- Farhad Hassan-

06:48.151 --> 06:50.318
and that is what
I am pursuing.

06:50.386 --> 06:53.989
You want to replace me as
head of CTU, be my guest.

06:54.056 --> 06:55.724
But until you do,

06:55.792 --> 06:57.692
stay the hell out of my way.

06:57.760 --> 06:59.494
Hastings, you're
making... I'll let you know

06:59.562 --> 07:01.229
when Bauer reaches Farhad.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.501
(sighs)

07:12.275 --> 07:16.478
Okay, Farhad Hassan is located on
the northeast corner of the warehouse.

07:16.546 --> 07:18.280
We're gonna have to move
fast, because he's injured.

07:18.347 --> 07:21.049
King, Lynch, you're gonna
go in from the south.

07:21.117 --> 07:22.384
Owen and I will
cover your flank.

07:22.451 --> 07:23.985
Understood. As soon as we've

07:24.053 --> 07:26.054
got him locked down, we're
gonna initiate our interrogation.

07:26.122 --> 07:27.255
CTU's gonna upload files on

07:27.323 --> 07:28.256
probable suspects-
I need that

07:28.324 --> 07:29.357
available and on a computer

07:29.425 --> 07:30.692
as soon as possible. Yes, sir.

07:30.760 --> 07:32.961
Mr. Bauer, we're getting
a call routed through CTU.

07:33.029 --> 07:33.995
It's Farhad Hassan.

07:34.063 --> 07:35.797
Put it on speaker.

07:35.865 --> 07:37.365
This is Jack Bauer. Go ahead.

07:37.433 --> 07:38.633
(quietly): How close are you?

07:38.701 --> 07:40.368
Ten minutes out. Are you okay?

07:40.436 --> 07:42.804
There's someone here.

07:42.872 --> 07:44.372
(crickets chirping)

07:44.440 --> 07:45.841
They're close.

07:45.908 --> 07:47.742
They're looking for me.

07:47.810 --> 07:50.979
Please... hurry.

07:55.818 --> 07:57.786
Madam President.

07:57.854 --> 07:59.721
I'm told you have my brother.

07:59.789 --> 08:00.956
What happened?

08:01.023 --> 08:02.123
Please.

08:05.695 --> 08:07.195
He called CTU

08:07.263 --> 08:08.897
and surrendered himself.

08:08.965 --> 08:10.465
I don't understand.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.801
The men that Farhad
was working with

08:12.869 --> 08:14.069
turned against him,

08:14.136 --> 08:16.404
and they have taken
the nuclear rods.

08:16.472 --> 08:18.607
Now, he believes that
they intend to construct

08:18.674 --> 08:20.675
a dirty bomb to
attack this city.

08:20.743 --> 08:22.310
Now, apparently,
these men are members

08:22.378 --> 08:23.945
of your covert
intelligence operations

08:24.013 --> 08:25.480
here in the United States.

08:25.548 --> 08:27.983
I find that hard to believe.

08:28.050 --> 08:29.951
Well, your brother
has no reason to lie.

08:30.019 --> 08:32.254
By turning himself in, he's
facing the death penalty.

08:32.321 --> 08:35.222
We have to assume
he's telling the truth.

08:35.291 --> 08:38.260
I need for you to give
us intelligence files

08:38.327 --> 08:40.895
for every asset you
have in this country

08:40.962 --> 08:44.099
so Farhad can identify
these terrorists.

08:44.166 --> 08:47.102
Mr. President,
I have given you

08:47.169 --> 08:48.737
a great deal of latitude

08:48.804 --> 08:50.805
to sort out your
domestic situation,

08:50.873 --> 08:53.842
<i>and now there is a
threat to my homeland,</i>

08:53.910 --> 08:55.777
and I need your cooperation.

08:55.845 --> 08:58.647
I suggest you turn
Farhad over to me

08:58.714 --> 09:00.782
<i>and let my people
question him.</i>

09:00.850 --> 09:02.183
We'll get the
answers you need.

09:02.251 --> 09:04.286
There's no time for thate'a Cm

09:04.353 --> 09:06.087
moving on Farhad as we speak.

09:06.155 --> 09:07.889
They need to
question him on site.

09:07.957 --> 09:09.624
I need the files.

09:09.692 --> 09:12.527
What you're asking is a
serious breach of our security.

09:12.595 --> 09:13.995
I understand that.

09:14.063 --> 09:15.530
But you need to understand

09:15.598 --> 09:18.233
that if this radiological
attack takes place,

09:18.301 --> 09:20.869
I will be forced to retaliate.

09:22.905 --> 09:26.041
You would attack...
my country?

09:26.108 --> 09:29.077
I will have no choice.

09:32.648 --> 09:34.816
I need those files...

09:34.884 --> 09:37.018
and I need them now.

09:42.792 --> 09:46.094
I'll call my acting
head of security.

09:46.162 --> 09:49.030
You'll get the files
in a few minutes.

09:49.098 --> 09:50.932
Thank you.

10:14.223 --> 10:16.725
I want you to know,
Tarin, that I don't believe

10:16.792 --> 10:18.560
you are guilty of treason.

10:18.627 --> 10:21.796
But I have no choice
but to follow orders.

10:21.864 --> 10:24.299
You don't have to
explain yourself, Nabeel.

10:24.367 --> 10:26.568
I would do the same
thing in your position.

10:26.635 --> 10:30.705
I don't hold any
of this against you.

10:31.941 --> 10:34.042
Whatever happens to me,

10:34.110 --> 10:35.677
you must not blame yourself.

10:35.745 --> 10:37.545
Never forget that.

10:37.613 --> 10:39.347
I appreciate that.

10:45.788 --> 10:47.622
Don't move. What
are you doing?

10:47.690 --> 10:49.157
Nabeel, give me
your weapon now.

10:49.225 --> 10:50.425
Slowly, two fingers.

10:50.493 --> 10:51.960
Come on.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.332
Driver, pull over here.

11:03.272 --> 11:05.140
Remove your seat belts.

11:05.207 --> 11:07.942
Put your hands on
your head, both of you.

11:13.149 --> 11:15.283
Get out of the car now.

11:15.351 --> 11:16.885
Don't move.

11:16.952 --> 11:18.153
Give me the keys.

11:22.291 --> 11:23.925
Put your hands down.
Tarin, don't do this.

11:23.993 --> 11:25.927
You'll only make things
worse for yourself.

11:25.995 --> 11:27.996
You know what they'll
do to me at our embassy.

11:28.064 --> 11:29.364
It can't be any worse.

11:29.432 --> 11:31.232
(phone ringing)

11:33.702 --> 11:35.437
It's President Hassan.

11:35.504 --> 11:37.072
Give it to me.

11:37.139 --> 11:38.807
Come on!

11:42.278 --> 11:43.778
Let's go. In the back.

11:43.846 --> 11:46.014
(ringing continues)

11:46.082 --> 11:48.950
Open it up.

11:49.018 --> 11:51.319
Take out your cuffs.
Lock yourselves down.

11:51.387 --> 11:54.122
(ringing continues)

12:00.296 --> 12:02.831
Nabeel isn't answering.

12:02.898 --> 12:04.132
Where is he?

12:04.200 --> 12:06.234
Transporting Tarin
to the embassy.

12:06.302 --> 12:07.969
Keep trying to reach
him on his mobile.

12:08.037 --> 12:10.004
If he doesn't answer,

12:10.072 --> 12:11.573
send a security
team to track him.

12:11.640 --> 12:12.941
Yes, sir.

12:13.008 --> 12:14.142
And contact Colonel Al Jhanis.

12:14.210 --> 12:15.543
Tell him on my authority

12:15.611 --> 12:17.612
to give CTU access to
the files they requested.

12:17.680 --> 12:18.947
Yes, sir.

12:30.659 --> 12:33.628
(phone ringing)

12:33.696 --> 12:34.963
Hello.

12:35.030 --> 12:36.131
It's me. Where are you?

12:36.198 --> 12:37.632
I'm leaving the
U.N. right now.

12:37.700 --> 12:39.200
Is everything all right?

12:39.268 --> 12:41.102
Yes, it worked.
Meet me at the hotel.

12:41.170 --> 12:42.670
I'll be there in ten minutes.

12:42.738 --> 12:45.173
I love you, Kayla.

12:45.241 --> 12:46.808
I'll see you soon.

13:03.837 --> 13:05.560
(over headset): Go ahead, Mr. Hastings.

13:05.615 --> 13:07.049
Farhad, are you there?

13:07.117 --> 13:10.018
Yes, yes, I'm here.

13:10.086 --> 13:11.920
Our field team is approaching
the south entrance.

13:11.988 --> 13:14.490
Stay where you are until
they secure the site.

13:14.557 --> 13:16.592
He's almost on me.

13:16.659 --> 13:18.227
I can't stay here.

13:18.294 --> 13:20.496
Do not move until they
lock down that shooter.

13:20.563 --> 13:22.398
Do you understand me?

13:24.000 --> 13:27.069
Farhad?

13:27.137 --> 13:28.904
Farhad?!

13:28.972 --> 13:31.573
Farhad, talk to me.

13:36.112 --> 13:37.112
(rapid gunshots)

13:40.850 --> 13:42.050
(tires squealing)

13:55.331 --> 13:57.599
Over here!

14:00.170 --> 14:02.237
Medic! Come on! Medic!

14:02.305 --> 14:03.806
JACK: That's him,
that's Farhad.

14:03.873 --> 14:05.707
Owen, take your team
and sweep the area.

14:05.775 --> 14:07.576
Chloe, we've got Farhad,
but he's been hit.

14:07.644 --> 14:09.044
I need those
files immediately.

14:09.112 --> 14:10.979
I.R.K. intelligence
just sent them over.

14:11.047 --> 14:12.047
Good.

14:16.719 --> 14:20.055
(phone ringing)

14:20.123 --> 14:21.323
Yes?

14:21.391 --> 14:22.591
It's done.

14:22.659 --> 14:24.493
Farhad is no longer a problem.

14:24.561 --> 14:25.661
Are you sure?

14:25.728 --> 14:27.196
I shot him twice, but
the police arrived,

14:27.263 --> 14:28.764
and I had to get out of there.

14:28.832 --> 14:31.133
You know where to find us.

14:31.201 --> 14:32.668
Yes.

14:35.672 --> 14:37.206
Mr. Bauer.

14:37.273 --> 14:39.141
Speak to me. We have two large
caliber slugs to the abdomen.

14:39.209 --> 14:41.410
He's bleeding out. I don't think
he's going to make it to the hospital.

14:41.478 --> 14:43.579
Do whatever you have
to do to stabilize him.

14:43.646 --> 14:45.647
We need to talk
to him now. Go!

14:46.716 --> 14:48.183
This is B team.

14:48.251 --> 14:51.620
We found their truck, but
there's no sign of the rods.

15:05.668 --> 15:08.537
Let me know as soon as
these files are uploaded.

15:08.605 --> 15:10.639
Mr. Hassan, in a few seconds,

15:10.707 --> 15:12.808
I'm going to show you
photographs of covert operatives

15:12.876 --> 15:14.810
working for your country
within the United States.

15:14.878 --> 15:16.945
I need you to identify the
men who stole the nuclear rods

15:17.013 --> 15:18.514
from you. Can you
do that for us?

15:18.581 --> 15:19.548
Yes.

15:19.616 --> 15:21.450
Are those files uploaded yet?!

15:21.518 --> 15:22.885
Almost. Come on!

15:22.952 --> 15:24.386
Blood pressure's dropping.
We've got a rapid heartbeat.

15:24.454 --> 15:25.888
What the hell's happening?

15:25.955 --> 15:27.656
He's going into shock.
Give me 20 cc's epinephrine.

15:27.724 --> 15:29.224
You keep that man alive,
do you understand me?

15:29.292 --> 15:31.393
Keep him alive!
Let me do my job!

15:38.301 --> 15:40.068
The telepresence conference

15:40.136 --> 15:42.404
is ready, Madam
President. Thank you.

15:50.246 --> 15:51.880
Good to see you, gentlemen.

15:51.948 --> 15:53.949
Madam President,
Brian Hastings at CTU

15:54.017 --> 15:55.717
has brought us up to speed,

15:55.785 --> 15:57.686
and we're ready to review
some specifics with you.

15:57.754 --> 15:59.021
Good. I'm listening.

15:59.088 --> 16:01.390
If you would refer
to your monitor...

16:01.457 --> 16:04.359
and the diagram of
Midtown Manhattan.

16:04.427 --> 16:06.094
According to CTU,

16:06.162 --> 16:08.997
the stolen nuclear rods have
a maximum explosive yield

16:09.065 --> 16:10.198
of 300 pounds.

16:10.266 --> 16:11.733
That's enough
radiological material

16:11.801 --> 16:13.468
to contaminate approximately
one square mile.

16:13.536 --> 16:15.737
If the device were detonated

16:15.805 --> 16:18.473
in a more densely
populated area of Manhattan,

16:18.541 --> 16:20.075
we could be looking
at casualties

16:20.143 --> 16:23.011
in the tens of thousands.

16:23.079 --> 16:24.513
Dr. Landry?

16:24.581 --> 16:27.182
Most of the deaths would be
from severe radiation poisoning.

16:27.250 --> 16:29.885
The remainder of the
victims would expire

16:29.953 --> 16:31.219
from radiation
induced illnesses.

16:31.287 --> 16:32.521
Primarily leukemia

16:32.589 --> 16:33.855
and other cancers.

16:33.923 --> 16:36.558
We also have to consider
that the affected area

16:36.626 --> 16:37.693
would be rendered
uninhabitable

16:37.760 --> 16:40.195
for approximately 40 years.

16:40.263 --> 16:43.098
Obviously a citywide evacuation
is out of the question.

16:43.166 --> 16:44.866
That's right. There are
millions of people on this island

16:44.934 --> 16:46.068
with few points of egress.

16:46.135 --> 16:47.436
It would take days
to get them out.

16:47.503 --> 16:49.671
Not to mention that going
public with this information

16:49.739 --> 16:51.139
would cause mass panic.

16:51.207 --> 16:53.976
I agree. We need to keep this
threat from the public for now.

16:54.043 --> 16:58.547
Focus our efforts on making sure
that this attack never happens.

16:58.615 --> 17:00.415
CTU believes the nuclear rods
are still outside the city,

17:00.483 --> 17:01.750
so they're fortifying
radiation detection efforts

17:01.818 --> 17:03.118
at the bridges and tunnels.

17:03.186 --> 17:06.421
We are also hardening
high value targets

17:06.489 --> 17:09.124
such as the financial
district, landmarks, subways.

17:09.192 --> 17:11.727
But we can't ignore that the
U.N. may also be a target.

17:11.794 --> 17:14.296
Give the danger, I think we should
evacuate the entire building.

17:14.364 --> 17:16.698
We can resume the conference
from a safe location.

17:20.136 --> 17:23.405
All right, inform the
delegates of the situation.

17:23.473 --> 17:26.040
Thank you, gentlemen.

17:34.917 --> 17:36.785
CTU has your
brother in custody.

17:36.853 --> 17:38.253
He's been shot.

17:38.321 --> 17:39.855
They're trying
to stabilize him.

17:39.922 --> 17:41.056
(two beeps)

17:42.291 --> 17:43.492
Yes?

17:43.559 --> 17:45.394
MAN: Sir, Agent Rahim
is calling for you.

17:45.461 --> 17:46.662
He says he's located Nabeel.

17:46.729 --> 17:47.829
Put him through.

17:49.165 --> 17:51.400
Mr. President, we found
Nabeel and his driver

17:51.467 --> 17:52.968
locked down in the
back of their vehicle.

17:53.036 --> 17:54.636
Tarin has escaped. What?!

17:54.704 --> 17:56.304
Nabeel wishes to
speak to you, sir.

17:56.372 --> 17:57.706
Yes, okay, put him on.

18:00.877 --> 18:03.512
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

18:03.579 --> 18:05.580
Tarin had the gun with him.

18:05.648 --> 18:06.848
I don't understand how.

18:06.916 --> 18:09.017
Are you saying somebody
helped him escape?

18:09.085 --> 18:10.686
It would seem so.

18:10.753 --> 18:12.187
But Mr. President,

18:12.255 --> 18:14.156
there's something
else you need to know.

18:14.223 --> 18:19.027
Right after he escaped, I
overheard Tarin on the phone.

18:19.095 --> 18:22.831
(whispering): I believe he
was speaking to your daughter.

18:26.569 --> 18:29.738
Kayla? Are you
sure about this?

18:29.806 --> 18:30.739
Yes, sir.

18:30.807 --> 18:32.908
It sounded like he
was going to meet her

18:32.975 --> 18:35.444
somewhere in the city.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.794
(phone ringing)

18:55.031 --> 18:56.031
(phone beeps)

18:57.300 --> 18:59.901
Kayla, call me back.

18:59.969 --> 19:02.370
Call me back, Kayla.

19:02.438 --> 19:04.306
(sighs)

19:12.815 --> 19:14.316
Come inside.

19:18.621 --> 19:21.590
Oh, thank God,
you're all right.

19:25.695 --> 19:26.962
Oh!

19:27.029 --> 19:28.864
I contacted an
American lawyer I know

19:28.931 --> 19:31.299
who's an expert at
international law.

19:31.367 --> 19:33.301
He's agreed to meet
us in two hours.

19:33.369 --> 19:35.904
This is such a
terrible situation.

19:35.972 --> 19:37.806
Yet I've never felt so happy.

19:37.874 --> 19:39.708
I feel the same.

19:48.151 --> 19:49.484
Mm!

19:53.923 --> 19:55.957
Mr. Bauer, we did our best.

19:56.025 --> 19:57.559
He didn't make it.

19:57.627 --> 19:59.728
I know you did. Thanks.

19:59.796 --> 20:01.596
We swept the area,
sir. It's clear.

20:01.664 --> 20:02.998
No hostiles. No trace
of the nuclear rods.

20:03.065 --> 20:04.299
Copy that.

20:04.367 --> 20:05.667
CTU, this is Bauer.

20:05.735 --> 20:07.769
We lost him. Farhad's dead.

20:07.837 --> 20:08.904
Damn it.

20:08.971 --> 20:10.438
I still think we've
got another play.

20:10.506 --> 20:13.542
Whoever shot Farhad couldn't
confirm that he was killed.

20:13.609 --> 20:15.177
We came up on him too fast.

20:15.244 --> 20:17.145
They don't know how
badly he was wounded.

20:17.213 --> 20:18.346
So what are you
proposing, Jack?

20:18.414 --> 20:19.781
I'm saying that we use
Farhad as dead bait.

20:19.849 --> 20:21.583
Leak it to the press that
we've got him in custody,

20:21.651 --> 20:22.851
and he survived.

20:22.919 --> 20:24.085
We're transporting
him to a local hospital

20:24.153 --> 20:25.353
where authorities are
going to question him.

20:25.421 --> 20:26.955
They'll have to
make a move on him.

20:27.023 --> 20:28.957
He knows too much.
Sounds like a Hail Mary.

20:29.025 --> 20:30.826
Right now it's the
only play we've got.

20:30.893 --> 20:32.828
But if they make a move on
Farhad, which I think they will,

20:32.895 --> 20:34.196
we'll be waiting for them.

20:34.263 --> 20:36.464
Mr. Hastings, you
said you wanted me in

20:36.532 --> 20:38.300
till this was
resolved. This is it.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.068
We have Hassan's
intelligence files.

20:40.136 --> 20:41.603
We can scan and
cross-reference

20:41.671 --> 20:42.938
with facial
recognition software.

20:43.005 --> 20:45.340
Maybe spot the terrorists
before they attack.

20:45.408 --> 20:46.942
All right, Jack.

20:47.009 --> 20:49.177
It's not exactly
standard procedure

20:49.245 --> 20:51.346
ferrying a dead man's
body across the city,

20:51.414 --> 20:53.014
but I'm willing
to give it a shot.

20:53.082 --> 20:54.216
We'll figure out
a hospital route

20:54.283 --> 20:55.450
and put a press
statement together.

20:55.518 --> 20:56.885
You get ready on your end.

20:56.953 --> 20:58.253
Okay, thank you.

20:58.321 --> 20:59.621
Get that body
ready for transport.

20:59.689 --> 21:00.989
Owen, assemble your men.

21:01.057 --> 21:02.490
Briefing in less than five.

21:10.718 --> 21:12.952
rial one is in position
over the route, sir.

21:13.020 --> 21:15.688
Sniper teams have checked
in. They're all in place.

21:24.931 --> 21:26.232
Come on, hurry up.

21:28.769 --> 21:30.736
(zipping bag)

21:31.671 --> 21:33.939
Let's go.

21:34.007 --> 21:35.541
(both grunting)

21:47.487 --> 21:49.989
(panting)

21:52.426 --> 21:54.760
(water gurgling)

22:06.540 --> 22:09.475
(water burbling)

22:12.646 --> 22:13.913
It's over, Dana.

22:13.980 --> 22:15.214
Let's get the other body

22:15.282 --> 22:16.215
and get cleaned up

22:16.283 --> 22:19.351
before we head back to CTU.

22:27.427 --> 22:29.128
Cole, what about us?

22:31.198 --> 22:32.832
I don't know.

22:37.237 --> 22:40.039
(grunting)

22:41.141 --> 22:42.842
We have just received word

22:42.909 --> 22:45.344
from New York
Counterterrorist Headquarters

22:45.412 --> 22:47.012
that Farhad
Hassan- brother of

22:47.080 --> 22:50.015
Islamic Republic of Kamistan
President Omar Hassan-

22:50.083 --> 22:52.384
has been found alive.

22:52.452 --> 22:55.321
We're told that Farhad
Hassan contacted CTU

22:55.388 --> 22:57.490
a short while ago and agreed
to turn him over to authorities.

22:57.557 --> 22:58.491
Farhad is alive.

22:58.558 --> 23:00.059
What?

23:00.127 --> 23:01.227
CTU responded immediately,

23:01.294 --> 23:02.995
but when they arrived,
they found him shot.

23:03.063 --> 23:05.664
No word yet on how
Farhad Hassan sustained

23:05.732 --> 23:06.899
these gunshot injuries,

23:06.967 --> 23:09.602
but we do know that he
is expected to survive,

23:09.669 --> 23:12.171
and he's being transported

23:12.239 --> 23:13.906
to St. Julian's Hospital
under heightened security

23:13.974 --> 23:15.875
where he will be
questioned by authorities.

23:15.942 --> 23:18.010
This is impossible.

23:18.078 --> 23:19.378
Farhad Hassan has been on the
run since early this evening...

23:19.446 --> 23:21.113
I shot him twice.

23:21.181 --> 23:23.516
But you didn't make
sure he was dead.

23:23.583 --> 23:25.417
I told you I didn't have time!

23:27.420 --> 23:31.457
I'll make this
right. I'll go back.

23:31.525 --> 23:32.558
You're too conspicuous.

23:32.626 --> 23:35.127
Farhad will be
heavily protected.

23:35.195 --> 23:36.562
But if Farhad talks,

23:36.630 --> 23:39.665
the authorities could find us
before we can build the weapon.

23:42.035 --> 23:44.170
You think we don't
know the implications?

23:46.873 --> 23:48.107
We're sending Marcos.

23:48.175 --> 23:50.109
His mother's American.

23:50.177 --> 23:51.644
They won't suspect him.

23:51.711 --> 23:53.913
He's in the truck
with the rods.

23:53.980 --> 23:55.948
The peace treaty
may now be halted

23:56.016 --> 23:57.983
due to a series of
alleged terrorist attacks.

24:10.430 --> 24:11.697
(phone flips open)

24:11.765 --> 24:13.265
(speed-dial tone)

24:15.769 --> 24:17.803
ELAINE (over phone): Hello?

24:17.871 --> 24:19.138
Mom, it's me.

24:19.206 --> 24:20.973
Marcos?

24:21.041 --> 24:23.709
Yes. Listen, I
can't talk for long.

24:23.777 --> 24:25.177
What is it? Are you okay?

24:25.245 --> 24:26.679
I'm fine, Mom.

24:26.746 --> 24:29.481
I need you to do
something for me.

24:29.549 --> 24:30.516
It's very important.

24:30.584 --> 24:32.718
Okay.

24:32.786 --> 24:34.019
Okay. What is it?

24:34.087 --> 24:37.790
I need you to get up right
now and leave the city.

24:37.857 --> 24:38.824
Go to Aunt Shelley's.

24:38.892 --> 24:39.825
Aunt Shelley's?!

24:39.893 --> 24:41.360
Just do it for me, okay?

24:41.428 --> 24:42.361
Don't ask me why.

24:42.429 --> 24:44.063
Leave right now.

24:44.130 --> 24:45.998
Marcos,

24:46.066 --> 24:47.299
this is crazy...

24:47.367 --> 24:48.634
I'm not gonna
leave the apartment

24:48.702 --> 24:50.469
in the middle of the
night for no reason.

24:50.537 --> 24:53.339
There's a reason; I just can't
tell you what it is right now.

24:53.406 --> 24:55.441
Please, Mom, do this for me.

24:55.508 --> 24:56.909
Where are you?

24:56.977 --> 24:58.777
Don't worry about me.

24:58.845 --> 25:00.846
Well, I'm not going
anywhere unless I know

25:00.914 --> 25:01.981
you're all right.

25:02.048 --> 25:03.649
I'll meet you at
Aunt Shelley's,

25:03.717 --> 25:04.650
and I'll explain everything.

25:04.718 --> 25:07.186
Go, Mom, now.

25:09.723 --> 25:11.156
Okay, I'm leaving.

25:11.224 --> 25:12.858
(door latch clanks)

25:12.926 --> 25:15.160
I have to go. I love you.

25:23.903 --> 25:26.005
Are you ready, my friend?

25:27.240 --> 25:28.574
Yes.

25:28.642 --> 25:30.309
Good.

25:30.377 --> 25:31.577
It's time.

25:33.713 --> 25:36.482
You need to keep him
looking alive the entire way.

25:36.549 --> 25:38.951
You're all clear on
what you need to do?

25:39.019 --> 25:40.019
Yes, sir.

25:40.086 --> 25:41.654
Jack, it's Hastings. Go ahead.

25:41.721 --> 25:43.155
We've coordinated
with news outlets.

25:43.223 --> 25:45.624
They put out the false
report of Farhad's arrest

25:45.692 --> 25:46.825
and transport to the hospital

25:46.893 --> 25:47.826
for questioning.

25:47.894 --> 25:49.695
The hook has been baited.

25:49.763 --> 25:51.163
Okay. The most
logical place for them

25:51.231 --> 25:52.498
to attack is when
we're en route.

25:52.565 --> 25:54.033
That's where we're gonna
be our most vulnerable.

25:54.100 --> 25:56.335
Well, NYPD and SWAT
are mobilizing now.

25:56.403 --> 25:57.670
They're going to be embedded

25:57.737 --> 25:59.505
at strategic points
along the way.

25:59.572 --> 26:01.774
They're also securing
St. Julian's Hospital.

26:01.841 --> 26:03.509
Copy that. Tell
the support teams

26:03.576 --> 26:05.444
it is imperative that we
take these terrorists alive.

26:05.512 --> 26:06.779
They've been briefed, Jack.

26:06.846 --> 26:07.780
Okay, we're moving out.

26:07.847 --> 26:09.148
You two take the follow van.

26:09.215 --> 26:10.983
Owen, you're with
me in the ambulance.

26:11.051 --> 26:12.651
Copy that.

26:12.719 --> 26:15.187
Hey, are you all right?

26:15.255 --> 26:16.755
Yes, sir.

26:16.823 --> 26:18.590
(whispering): Look, I
know you and your men

26:18.658 --> 26:20.225
have not had a lot
of field experience,

26:20.293 --> 26:22.227
and we have put you in
an extreme situation.

26:22.295 --> 26:24.163
But I promise you,
if we're attacked,

26:24.230 --> 26:26.065
every part of this
route is covered.

26:26.132 --> 26:27.966
We've got a lot of
support out there.

26:28.034 --> 26:30.336
I'm fine, Mr. Bauer.

26:30.403 --> 26:31.503
Let's do this.

26:34.741 --> 26:36.075
Yeah.

27:02.980 --> 27:04.914
Our delegation is
preparing to head

27:04.982 --> 27:06.249
to McGuire Air force Base.

27:06.317 --> 27:08.184
We'll be setting up a
temporary ops center there,

27:08.252 --> 27:10.653
where we'll be able to
monitor the situation.

27:10.721 --> 27:11.821
And the other delegates?

27:11.889 --> 27:13.289
U.N. Security will
coordinate the evacuation.

27:13.357 --> 27:15.325
Everything should go smoothly.

27:17.027 --> 27:18.695
Can I get you anything,

27:18.763 --> 27:19.829
Madam President?

27:19.897 --> 27:21.898
No, thank you, Rob.

27:21.966 --> 27:23.500
You have done
more than enough.

27:23.567 --> 27:25.769
I'm just sorry that
your first few months

27:25.836 --> 27:28.304
on the job have
been so challenging.

27:28.372 --> 27:30.407
I wouldn't have had
it any other way.

27:33.611 --> 27:35.645
I'll see you in a moment.

27:40.918 --> 27:43.653
I spoke to one of my aides.

27:43.721 --> 27:46.156
He told me my
brother is... dead.

27:46.223 --> 27:48.358
I'm afraid so.

27:48.426 --> 27:50.894
When CTU is finished
with their operation,

27:50.961 --> 27:53.363
I would like Farhad's remains

27:53.431 --> 27:55.565
to be returned to my country.

27:55.633 --> 27:57.333
Personally, I don't
care where his body rots,

27:57.401 --> 28:00.303
but my mother will
want a proper burial.

28:00.371 --> 28:02.372
I'll see that it's done.

28:02.440 --> 28:04.374
But right now, Mr. President,

28:04.442 --> 28:06.409
we must all evacuate the U.N.

28:06.477 --> 28:08.178
I'm not leaving,

28:08.245 --> 28:10.213
Madame President.
I'm staying here.

28:10.281 --> 28:11.714
I don't understand.

28:11.782 --> 28:15.518
My daughter Kayla is missing.

28:15.586 --> 28:18.421
Missing?

28:18.489 --> 28:21.991
Kayla is romantically involved
with my former head of security.

28:22.059 --> 28:23.893
She's run off with him.

28:23.961 --> 28:25.628
Tell me what we
can do to help.

28:25.696 --> 28:26.896
I appreciate that,

28:26.964 --> 28:29.699
but my security teams
are searching for her now.

28:29.767 --> 28:33.002
I understand how
worried you must be,

28:33.070 --> 28:34.771
but there is nothing
that you can do

28:34.839 --> 28:36.105
to help her by staying here.

28:36.173 --> 28:38.942
Please come where
you'll be safe.

28:39.009 --> 28:40.944
I can't, Madam President.

28:41.011 --> 28:43.112
She's somewhere in the city,

28:43.180 --> 28:46.049
with no idea that a
nuclear threat exists.

28:46.116 --> 28:50.954
I won't go anywhere
until she's been found.

28:51.021 --> 28:52.489
All right.

28:55.125 --> 28:56.593
I understand.

28:57.761 --> 28:59.529
I will talk to you very soon.

28:59.597 --> 29:01.064
Thank you.

29:11.242 --> 29:13.042
They're turning
west Sixth Street.

29:13.110 --> 29:14.477
Pulling into the hospital.

29:37.835 --> 29:40.169
Chloe, bring up the
hospital security feed.

29:40.237 --> 29:43.506
Get facial recognition
up and running.

29:48.879 --> 29:51.014
CTU, this is Bauer. We're
moving into position.

29:51.081 --> 29:53.116
Farhad's body's been
taken to his room.

29:54.818 --> 29:57.654
Let's go!

29:59.523 --> 30:02.025
Secure these doors!

30:22.179 --> 30:23.980
HASTINGS: Bring up
the exterior cameras.

30:53.010 --> 30:55.111
âª âª

31:11.795 --> 31:13.463
(phone rings)

31:15.265 --> 31:16.532
This is Bauer.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.534
Jack, it's me.

31:18.602 --> 31:19.836
Hey.

31:19.903 --> 31:21.437
I've been released.
I'm free to go.

31:21.505 --> 31:22.739
Good.

31:22.806 --> 31:24.407
Chloe told me what you did.

31:24.475 --> 31:25.742
You leveraged Hastings.

31:25.809 --> 31:27.377
Said that you would
head up field ops

31:27.444 --> 31:29.045
until this crisis was over

31:29.113 --> 31:33.549
in exchange for CTU dropping
any possible charges against me.

31:33.617 --> 31:36.285
I didn't ask you
to do that, Jack.

31:36.353 --> 31:37.820
I know you didn't.

31:37.888 --> 31:39.989
Look, someone in the White
House is trying to set you up

31:40.057 --> 31:42.091
to take responsibility for
the failure of our mission,

31:42.159 --> 31:44.293
and I couldn't let that happen

31:44.361 --> 31:46.462
because you did nothing wrong.

31:46.530 --> 31:47.797
You understand me?

31:47.865 --> 31:50.266
Renee, you need
to let this go.

31:50.334 --> 31:52.735
You're not responsible
for what's happening

31:52.803 --> 31:54.604
Yeah, okay.

31:54.672 --> 31:59.409
Hey, I meant what
I said earlier.

31:59.476 --> 32:03.179
When this is over, I want
to be there for you...

32:03.247 --> 32:04.313
with you.

32:06.150 --> 32:07.316
I'd like that.

32:07.384 --> 32:10.053
I'll have a CTU agent
take you to my apartment.

32:10.120 --> 32:12.522
I'll meet you there
when this is over.

32:12.589 --> 32:14.323
All right, Jack.

32:15.926 --> 32:18.094
Look, I'm getting chatter
over the comm. I gotta go.

32:18.162 --> 32:20.296
Okay, bye.

32:21.632 --> 32:22.665
This is Bauer. Go ahead.

32:22.733 --> 32:24.000
HASTINGS: Jack,

32:24.068 --> 32:25.635
facial recognition
just picked up a match

32:25.703 --> 32:28.071
with the I.R.K.
intelligence files.

32:28.138 --> 32:30.073
His name's Marcos Al-Zacar.

32:30.140 --> 32:31.140
American-born.

32:31.208 --> 32:32.975
Working undercover
with the I.R.K.

32:33.043 --> 32:34.043
for the last three years.

32:34.111 --> 32:35.144
Where is he?

32:35.212 --> 32:36.145
Approaching the side entrance.

32:36.213 --> 32:37.613
Brown hair, blue scrubs,

32:37.681 --> 32:38.748
wearing aÃ© dark-blue jacket.

32:38.816 --> 32:39.982
Copy that.

32:40.050 --> 32:42.051
Hold on, Jack. he's got
something in his hand.

32:42.119 --> 32:43.519
It looks like a
remote detonator.

32:43.587 --> 32:45.354
I think he's wearing a vest.

32:45.422 --> 32:48.658
Chloe, can you
disarm it from there?

32:48.726 --> 32:50.660
Possibly, if I can pin
down the detonator model,

32:50.728 --> 32:52.762
I may be able to
scramble the arming code

32:52.830 --> 32:54.397
using the transmitter
in the mobile comm.

32:54.465 --> 32:56.165
Get on it. Owen,
you've got a man

32:56.233 --> 32:58.301
approaching your position.
He's got brown hair.

32:58.368 --> 33:00.603
He's wearing green
scrubs and a blue jacket.

33:00.671 --> 33:03.139
Yeah. I see him.

33:03.207 --> 33:04.307
He's our hitter. We believe

33:04.374 --> 33:05.441
he's wearing an explosive vest

33:05.509 --> 33:06.576
with a remote detonator.

33:06.643 --> 33:07.744
Okay. What should I do?

33:07.811 --> 33:09.946
Stay calm and do
whatever he asks.

33:10.013 --> 33:11.748
CTU techs are going to try and
disarm the vest from offsite.

33:11.815 --> 33:14.083
Okay.

33:14.151 --> 33:15.318
Owen?

33:15.385 --> 33:16.586
Owen.

33:16.653 --> 33:18.387
You can do this.

33:18.455 --> 33:21.023
Just try and slow him
down as much as possible.

33:21.091 --> 33:22.892
We've got you covered
every inch of the way.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.527
Yes, sir.

33:24.595 --> 33:26.596
(exhaling)

33:30.434 --> 33:31.667
Excuse me. This
is a secure area.

33:31.735 --> 33:33.136
I'm going to need
to see some I.D.

33:36.874 --> 33:38.941
Listen to me very carefully.

33:39.009 --> 33:41.110
I have a bomb.

33:41.178 --> 33:44.480
Give me your weapon right
now, or I'll kill us both.

33:46.283 --> 33:48.451
Your weapon now.

33:48.519 --> 33:50.086
Okay. Okay.

33:50.154 --> 33:51.487
Just take it easy.

33:51.555 --> 33:53.356
Slowly.

33:53.423 --> 33:55.424
Yeah.

34:03.567 --> 34:05.168
Where is Farhad Hassan?

34:05.235 --> 34:06.569
Third floor.

34:06.637 --> 34:08.304
Take me to him.

34:08.371 --> 34:09.572
Anyone asks who I am,

34:09.639 --> 34:11.239
you say I'm a doctor,
and I'm cleared.

34:11.308 --> 34:12.341
Come on, son.

34:12.409 --> 34:14.076
Okay.

34:14.143 --> 34:16.478
Move.

34:16.547 --> 34:17.713
Okay. Go.

34:43.255 --> 34:44.422
Hello?

34:44.489 --> 34:47.092
Dalia, it's me.

34:47.159 --> 34:48.427
We need to talk.

34:48.494 --> 34:50.228
Don't try to change
my mind, Omar.

34:50.295 --> 34:52.563
I told you, I'm leaving.

34:52.632 --> 34:54.232
I haven't called
to change your mind.

34:54.300 --> 34:58.103
I called because
Kayla may be in danger.

34:58.171 --> 34:59.337
What do you mean?

34:59.405 --> 35:01.773
She's run away with Tarin.

35:01.841 --> 35:02.908
They've been
seeing each other.

35:02.975 --> 35:04.142
I know.

35:06.412 --> 35:07.712
How long have you known?

35:07.780 --> 35:09.648
What difference
does it make, Omar?

35:09.715 --> 35:11.283
What kind of danger is she in?

35:11.350 --> 35:13.085
Farhad is dead.

35:13.152 --> 35:15.253
The nuclear material
he tried to acquire

35:15.321 --> 35:16.855
is in the hands
of the terrorists.

35:16.923 --> 35:19.658
They're going to use
it here in Manhattan.

35:19.725 --> 35:20.792
No.

35:22.628 --> 35:23.762
How did this happen?

35:23.830 --> 35:24.830
I'll explain later.

35:24.897 --> 35:26.932
But right now you
need to call Kayla.

35:26.999 --> 35:29.000
I've left messages, but
she won't return my calls.

35:29.068 --> 35:30.669
But she might talk to you.

35:31.838 --> 35:34.873
Please, Dalia.
She's angry at me.

35:34.941 --> 35:36.675
I had Tarin arrested.

35:36.742 --> 35:38.477
I thought he was part
of the conspiracy.

35:40.012 --> 35:42.447
All right.

35:42.515 --> 35:44.449
But Omar, what about you?

35:44.517 --> 35:46.184
Don't worry about me.

35:46.252 --> 35:48.186
Just help me
find our daughter.

35:48.254 --> 35:51.123
I- I'll try.

35:55.962 --> 35:57.963
Sabira, I need the captain.

36:25.958 --> 36:27.959
(elevator bell dings)

36:36.135 --> 36:38.770
Chloe, it's Jack. We're
moving to the third floor.

36:38.838 --> 36:40.005
Where are we at with the vest?

36:40.072 --> 36:41.573
I've identified
the detonator, Jack.

36:41.641 --> 36:43.775
It's German-made, K7 variant,

36:43.843 --> 36:46.244
but that model is used in
a lot of configurations.

36:46.312 --> 36:47.345
I'm going to need a
visual on the vest.

36:47.413 --> 36:49.080
Copy that.

36:49.148 --> 36:50.515
Owen, it's Jack.

36:50.583 --> 36:53.018
CTU cannot disarm the
vest unless they see it.

36:53.085 --> 36:54.186
I need you to get the hostile

36:54.253 --> 36:55.654
underneath one of the
surveillance cameras

36:55.721 --> 36:56.922
and make him show it to you.

36:56.989 --> 36:58.924
I repeat, CTU cannot
disarm the vest

36:58.991 --> 37:00.325
unless they see it.

37:00.393 --> 37:03.028
You ready?

37:12.505 --> 37:15.040
(over comm): Team three, they're
approaching your position.

37:31.591 --> 37:32.857
What are you doing?

37:32.925 --> 37:35.060
I want to see proof.

37:35.127 --> 37:36.661
Proof of what?

37:36.729 --> 37:37.862
A bomb.

37:37.930 --> 37:41.099
I don't believe you have one.

37:41.167 --> 37:44.536
You don't keep moving,
you're gonna find out.

37:46.339 --> 37:49.941
Right now.

37:50.009 --> 37:54.079
You want Farhad, you show me.

37:55.114 --> 37:57.215
I said, "Move."

37:57.283 --> 37:59.618
No.

38:13.432 --> 38:14.432
Owen did it, Jack.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.767
I've got a visual on the vest.

38:15.835 --> 38:17.569
Now, move.

38:17.637 --> 38:21.339
Okay.

38:22.942 --> 38:24.342
We're set in position
near Farhad's room.

38:24.410 --> 38:25.810
Now, what's the status?

38:25.878 --> 38:27.579
It's a DDR configuration.

38:27.647 --> 38:29.781
I just need to pull up the
frequency of the receiver.

38:29.849 --> 38:31.182
Chloe, you've got
about 30 seconds

38:31.250 --> 38:32.751
before they reach that room.

38:36.856 --> 38:38.790
Got it.

38:38.858 --> 38:40.892
3.15 gigahertz, standard GSM.

38:40.960 --> 38:42.193
Running it through
the mobile comm now.

38:42.261 --> 38:43.895
This'll take a few seconds.

38:46.499 --> 38:48.533
Stand by for assault.

38:54.674 --> 38:56.074
On the floor, face down!

38:56.142 --> 38:57.676
Do it now!

38:57.743 --> 38:58.843
Don't move!

38:58.911 --> 39:01.846
Come on, Arlo. Hurry up.

39:03.282 --> 39:05.917
(timer beeping)

39:15.094 --> 39:16.961
That's it. It's done.

39:17.029 --> 39:18.730
Jack, the vest is disarmed.

39:18.798 --> 39:20.332
Move in. Go, go, go!

39:23.602 --> 39:26.338
(timer beeping)

39:34.146 --> 39:35.447
(grunts)

39:40.553 --> 39:42.554
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

39:45.558 --> 39:47.258
(door slams open)

39:49.328 --> 39:50.528
(gun clicks empty)

39:50.596 --> 39:51.930
It's all right.

39:51.997 --> 39:53.198
It's all right.
Lower your weapons.

39:53.265 --> 39:54.933
It's all right.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.669
I'm going to put my gun away.

39:57.737 --> 39:59.437
We're not here to hurt you.

39:59.505 --> 40:01.039
We just want to talk.

40:01.107 --> 40:03.174
Stay calm.

40:03.242 --> 40:05.377
It's all right.

40:05.444 --> 40:08.813
I just want to talk to you.

40:11.817 --> 40:14.386
No. No!

40:14.453 --> 40:15.887
(grunts)

40:22.128 --> 40:24.129
He's still moving.
Notify the perimeter.

40:31.203 --> 40:34.572
Do not fire! He's unarmed!

40:53.559 --> 40:55.193
(slams shut)

41:02.168 --> 41:04.169
(grunting and panting)

41:19.051 --> 41:21.052
(straining)

41:26.826 --> 41:28.460
This is Bauer.

41:28.527 --> 41:30.195
I'm in the east wing.

41:30.262 --> 41:31.763
Suspect has barricaded himself

41:31.831 --> 41:33.231
in some kind of
pressure chamber.

41:33.299 --> 41:35.633
I need a team down here now
to help me open the door.

41:45.878 --> 41:48.279
(cell phone ringing)

41:48.347 --> 41:49.447
Yes?

41:49.515 --> 41:50.615
MARCOS (on phone):
It was a trap.

41:50.683 --> 41:52.116
Farhad was already dead.

41:52.184 --> 41:54.152
What? The police were waiting.

41:54.220 --> 41:55.720
They tried to ambush
me, but I got away.

41:55.788 --> 41:57.055
Where are you?

41:57.122 --> 41:59.557
I locked myself inside
some kind of oxygen chamber.

41:59.625 --> 42:00.725
They can't get in here.

42:00.793 --> 42:02.360
At least not yet.

42:02.428 --> 42:03.862
You know what you must do.

42:03.929 --> 42:05.296
I can't.

42:05.364 --> 42:08.533
I- I think they-they
scrambled the arming code.

42:08.601 --> 42:10.368
You need to set
it off manually.

42:10.436 --> 42:11.636
I don't know how to do that.

42:11.704 --> 42:12.937
I'll talk you through it.

42:13.005 --> 42:15.073
Can you open the
detonator control?

42:15.140 --> 42:17.475
Yeah. I-I think so.

42:17.543 --> 42:19.744
Um, it's going
to take a minute.

42:19.812 --> 42:21.145
Work quickly.

42:21.213 --> 42:24.549
You cannot let
them take you alive.

42:29.221 --> 42:30.388
Can you hear me?

42:36.495 --> 42:38.496
JACK (over comm):
I just want to talk.
