00:12.012 --> 00:13.304
<i>Previously on </i>Dynasty:

00:13.388 --> 00:16.891
I'd like to speak to Mr. Blake Carrington.
My name is Cristal Jennings.

00:16.975 --> 00:19.644
I was a friend of your late wife,
Cristal Flores.

00:19.728 --> 00:21.479
I think she wanted me to come
and help you.

00:24.190 --> 00:27.318
To the marriage of the Van Kirks
and the Carringtons.

00:27.402 --> 00:30.405
If you wanna thank me,
come to my penthouse tomorrow night.

00:32.323 --> 00:35.118
I have a date tonight.
I need somebody who can fill in.

00:35.201 --> 00:38.204
Something bad happened.
He started freaking and couldn't breathe.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.832
He said he was having a heart attack.
He's... dead.

00:45.503 --> 00:49.466
So, she went from head of PR
to COO in four years?

00:49.549 --> 00:51.760
I know how to pick them.
-I'm not surprised.

00:51.843 --> 00:55.472
I mean, Celia was everyone's favorite
back at the hospital.

00:55.805 --> 00:56.806
Hospital?

00:57.557 --> 01:00.810
She volunteered at a hospital in Mexico.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.187
That's how we met.

01:02.896 --> 01:06.816
I was a patient, and when she told me
what she had been through in Venezuela

01:06.900 --> 01:11.071
and how her dream was to come to America,
I gave her my identity to start a new life

01:11.154 --> 01:12.739
'cause I thought mine was over.

01:13.823 --> 01:15.533
You really didn't know any of this?

01:18.953 --> 01:20.872
Okay. Relax for a second.

01:21.206 --> 01:23.708
-Don't move. Face down.

01:25.502 --> 01:28.463
There you go. I'm a healer.
That was our deal.

01:28.546 --> 01:32.383
Trust me, your hand will heal faster.
You have a lot of tension in your back.

01:32.467 --> 01:35.178
'Cause I have an entire family riding
on my coattails.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.262
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:36.346 --> 01:39.933
What hurts is learning I did
a miserable job getting to know my wife.

01:40.016 --> 01:42.393
What do you wanna know about her?
Ask me anything.

01:43.561 --> 01:44.813
Would you go to dinner with me?

01:46.189 --> 01:48.316
-So you can tell me more about her.
-Okay.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.402
Someplace where it's acceptable
to wear jeans?

01:51.486 --> 01:54.030
-Because that's all I brought.
-I have an idea.

01:54.739 --> 01:56.116
I'll be wheels-up by noon.

01:57.242 --> 02:01.037
Hey, so, good news.
Max's head attorney, Vance,

02:01.121 --> 02:04.207
has the executed contract we need
to complete the sale of CA.

02:04.290 --> 02:06.793
Bad news,
he wants me to fly to New York to get it.

02:06.876 --> 02:10.088
-So, worst news,

02:10.171 --> 02:12.132
Max propositioned me.

02:12.215 --> 02:16.678
I had an escort pretend to be me and sleep
with him to get the contract, but he died.

02:16.761 --> 02:19.472
-Look, it was an accident.

02:19.556 --> 02:22.642
I'm scared Vance might know something
and try to blackmail me.

02:22.725 --> 02:25.103
While you're giving me that look,
which guts me,

02:25.186 --> 02:27.063
know that I know it was wrong,

02:27.147 --> 02:30.483
morally and professionally,
maybe even spiritually.

02:31.568 --> 02:32.735
Please say something.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.155
It seems like every time
we get close to starting over,

02:35.238 --> 02:37.407
the world keeps trying to screw us.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.450
Are you sure
you still wanna be engaged to this?

02:40.076 --> 02:41.119
Can you believe it?

02:42.162 --> 02:45.248
So, your plan is to fly to New York
to get the contract?

02:45.331 --> 02:47.375
Yes, and to handle the escort.

02:47.458 --> 02:50.545
Let's just pray she likes
leather suitcases stuffed with cash.

02:51.629 --> 02:54.465
Ms. Carrington,
Liam Ridley is waiting downstairs for you.

02:55.758 --> 02:57.760
They found him naked in his penthouse.

02:59.679 --> 03:02.265
They said he died of a heart attack.
Nobody saw it coming.

03:02.348 --> 03:05.643
I'm so... shocked and sorry.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.395
I know how much Max meant to you.

03:07.478 --> 03:10.023
Yeah, well, there's more.

03:11.232 --> 03:13.568
Our family in New York
will be throwing a memorial.

03:13.651 --> 03:15.820
-Well, we can go to New York.
-I can't.

03:16.195 --> 03:19.365
See, my mom wasn't close
with her brother, but she knew I was,

03:19.449 --> 03:22.118
so, she's flying over from Capri
to see how I'm doing.

03:24.412 --> 03:26.247
-And to meet my wife.

03:26.331 --> 03:29.000
She's the one who will be
taking over the company now.

03:29.083 --> 03:31.628
-She's gonna have to sign off on the sale.
-Of course.

03:31.711 --> 03:35.715
Unless Uncle Max signed the contract
before he died, but I don't think he did.

03:35.798 --> 03:38.801
I called his lawyers.
They couldn't find the executed copy.

03:41.095 --> 03:44.224
I'll leave you two alone,
but can I talk to you first, Fallon?

03:46.809 --> 03:48.478
-I don't know what to do.
-I do.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.939
You're staying. I'm going to New York.

03:51.022 --> 03:54.943
I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get you
away from these people. Then it's just us.

03:55.652 --> 03:58.905
So, are you here to apologize
or just violate my Dolce?

03:59.530 --> 04:03.243
No, I came because I wanted to put
our differences aside for Steven's sake.

04:03.326 --> 04:06.412
Oh, and the baby's,
who is innocent in all of this.

04:06.496 --> 04:09.707
Well, every despicable human
was once an innocent baby.

04:10.208 --> 04:13.711
Would you let us host a baby shower?
It would mean the world to Steven.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.004
Was that an apology?

04:15.088 --> 04:17.090
An invitation. Don't push it.

04:18.675 --> 04:22.887
Okay, I am sorry
for doubting your pregnancy.

04:23.304 --> 04:26.432
And for exposing your naked body
to all those strangers.

04:27.016 --> 04:29.644
Now... can we host the shower?

04:29.727 --> 04:30.979
Well, that depends.

04:31.062 --> 04:33.523
What do you want everyone
to call you from now on?

04:33.606 --> 04:36.276
"Nana Alexis" or "Meemaw"

04:36.359 --> 04:39.821
or something more classic, like "Granny"?

04:39.904 --> 04:41.739
Listen, you low-level vaginal climber.

04:41.823 --> 04:45.451
We can have a judge take that kid
faster than you removed your diaphragm.

04:45.535 --> 04:48.496
Don't be jealous.
It's an even worse look than that suit.

04:48.746 --> 04:50.873
-Well, you will be

04:50.957 --> 04:54.085
once your grandchild is the heir
to the Carrington fortune

04:54.168 --> 04:55.837
and won't have to settle like you did

04:55.920 --> 04:58.756
for whatever scraps
a two-bit divorce lawyer can get.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.384
But, yes, you can host the shower.

05:01.467 --> 05:02.927
Steven texted me earlier.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.345
Of course he did.

05:05.346 --> 05:06.764
-Calm down.

05:07.265 --> 05:09.976
Fallon, come out, come out,
wherever you're coiled up.

05:10.059 --> 05:11.185
What is happening?

05:11.269 --> 05:16.190
Oh. Glad to see you looking so well,
Mrs. Carrington,

05:16.607 --> 05:18.151
after all you've been through.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.987
-Kirby.
-You don't seem very happy to see me.

05:21.070 --> 05:22.405
Such a surprise.

05:22.488 --> 05:25.325
I would've expected... more tattoos.

05:26.075 --> 05:28.328
Perhaps the names of other families
you've tormented.

05:28.411 --> 05:31.039
Just yours, Alexis, right across my ass.

05:32.373 --> 05:33.499
What's she doing here?

05:33.583 --> 05:36.961
I'm looking for your spawn
who pressed charges against me,

05:37.045 --> 05:39.380
so, I have to go
to court-ordered anger management

05:39.464 --> 05:41.090
just because I wanted
a few words with her.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.509
I believe those words were "assault"
and "battery." I believe Fallon paid off a judge
to say that.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.764
-I want her out.
-Give her a chance.

05:47.847 --> 05:51.392
-The situation is only worsening.
-She set fire to Fallon's room.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.644
I told you a million times,
I didn't do it.

05:53.728 --> 05:56.189
Sorry to interrupt,
but U.S. customs is calling

05:56.272 --> 05:57.690
about a $400,000 shipment.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.818
-We're a bit busy, Gunnerson.
-I'm fine, Dad. You can go.

06:01.527 --> 06:02.653
I promise.

06:02.737 --> 06:05.907
Not far, in case she decides
to manhandle me again.

06:08.159 --> 06:10.495
Do you understand what it does
to a little girl

06:10.578 --> 06:12.163
to be ripped from her parent?

06:12.246 --> 06:15.041
To be shipped halfway around the world
for no reason?

06:15.124 --> 06:16.125
No reason?

06:16.209 --> 06:19.670
You off your meds?
-We both know I didn't start that fire.

06:19.754 --> 06:22.131
-You were always a dramatic brat.
-I was a kid.

06:23.049 --> 06:27.428
And you thought you got rid of me.
You told everyone I was the problem child.

06:27.512 --> 06:31.057
Well, I'm back, bitch.
And I'm your problem now.

06:54.997 --> 06:56.874
Careful. Gently.

06:56.958 --> 07:01.003
They've had a long flight from Japan.
Any stress can affect their tenderness.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.840
I heard that music's quite good
for treating stress.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.007
Should I sing to them?

07:05.091 --> 07:08.052
These are no ordinary
baby back ribs, Anders.

07:08.594 --> 07:09.929
These are <i>kurobuta.</i>

07:10.012 --> 07:12.974
They're from pigs that have
not only been fed Japanese beer,

07:13.057 --> 07:15.601
but they've had Japanese beer
massaged into them.

07:16.185 --> 07:18.813
-I want their life.
-Except for the slaughtered part.

07:19.272 --> 07:22.859
I'm concerned
that your baby-tacular shower

07:22.942 --> 07:26.028
seems to be over-over-the-top
even by Carrington standards.

07:26.112 --> 07:29.323
Don't be. I need to make this an event
Steven cherishes forever.

07:29.407 --> 07:32.368
And wait till you see the baby giraffes
and baby elephants.

07:32.452 --> 07:36.080
-Totes adorbs.
-Baby animals are totes adorbs.

07:36.664 --> 07:39.834
But their fecal business,
not so much, not in this house.

07:39.917 --> 07:42.086
You can have your ribs, but that's it.

07:43.129 --> 07:47.717
But, Miguel, you know that I like
my black-eyed Susans to have more space.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.219
These are strangling each other,
and they cannot breathe.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.220
Hi, Mom.

07:57.602 --> 08:00.229
I do not love this haircut on you.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.401
You must be Fallon. My God.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.321
-You are stunning.
-You're too kind.

08:08.404 --> 08:10.823
-I'm so thrilled to finally meet you.

08:11.824 --> 08:15.870
And George and I, we would have rushed
right down here to Atlanta

08:15.953 --> 08:16.996
for your wedding,

08:17.455 --> 08:20.833
but Jack, or Liam, whatever it is
he's going by these days,

08:20.917 --> 08:22.418
he neglected to even have one

08:22.502 --> 08:26.005
or even tell us about you
until afterwards. Ooh.

08:26.088 --> 08:27.882
We can get to know each other now.

08:27.965 --> 08:30.635
And I'm truly sorry
for the loss of your brother.

08:30.718 --> 08:34.138
-It's so tragic.
-Yes, the tragedy of Max's passing.

08:34.639 --> 08:37.850
It's that I could not be there
to be with him on his deathbed

08:37.934 --> 08:39.894
to give him the finger one last time.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.230
Why am I always late to the party?

08:42.313 --> 08:43.314
Hey.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.775
-All right.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.819
-Fallon, this is my stepfather, George.
-Hi.

08:48.903 --> 08:50.780
Wouldn't you have made
the most gorgeous bride?

08:50.863 --> 08:53.324
-Oh.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.076
I hope you like to swing.

08:58.120 --> 08:58.996
Mm.

09:00.039 --> 09:03.960
Oh, my God.
This is like a Barneys catalog in 3-D.

09:04.043 --> 09:07.213
-You like the Dior. Excellent.
-They're all stunning, Blake.

09:08.089 --> 09:11.342
But I think I'd feel a little weird
trying on my friend's clothes.

09:12.468 --> 09:15.471
-My dead friend's clothes.
-Cristal would want you to.

09:15.555 --> 09:19.475
The Carrington style team... will make
sure that everything fits you perfectly.

09:26.107 --> 09:29.652
<i>♪ When I'm with you, baby</i>
<i>I go out of my head ♪</i>

09:29.735 --> 09:32.989
<i>♪ And I just can't get enough</i>
<i>I just can't get enough ♪</i>

09:33.698 --> 09:37.159
<i>♪ All the things you do to me</i>
<i>And everything you say ♪</i>

09:37.243 --> 09:38.619
<i>♪ I just can't get enough ♪</i>

09:38.703 --> 09:42.081
Liam, maybe guard the alley for once.

09:42.164 --> 09:45.585
Or do you want her to get it
past you for the seventh time, huh?

09:45.668 --> 09:48.129
Sorry, but tennis is a blood sport
around here.

09:48.212 --> 09:50.464
People have been executed
for missing a backhand.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.854
Liam, are you okay?

10:04.937 --> 10:08.399
Oh, he blocked my shot.
And that would've been a winner.

10:08.482 --> 10:11.360
You always do exactly the wrong thing,
Liam, always.

10:12.528 --> 10:15.948
-We're gonna play that point over.

10:17.074 --> 10:18.618
-Yeah.
Unbelievable.

10:20.494 --> 10:23.205
How many of these ridiculous
court-appointed sessions

10:23.289 --> 10:25.082
do I have to sit through, Dr. Toscanni?

10:25.166 --> 10:28.544
It would help me get to the root
of your anger with the Carringtons

10:28.628 --> 10:30.129
if I knew your history with them.

10:30.212 --> 10:33.007
Tell me some of your earlier memories,
before you left.

10:33.090 --> 10:34.717
You mean before I was banished.

10:35.343 --> 10:38.721
They blamed me for setting fire
to Fallon's room and kicked me out.

10:38.804 --> 10:39.722
That sounds painful.

10:39.805 --> 10:42.850
I spent a lifetime
trying to forget the rest of my memories.

10:43.934 --> 10:46.145
That makes me smart, not crazy.

10:46.228 --> 10:49.982
Look, there's something
I don't typically do with my clients.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.151
Don't even think about it.

10:52.234 --> 10:53.819
-Hypnosis.
-Oh.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.947
Would you be open to me
unblocking some of those memories?

10:57.031 --> 10:59.283
Only weak minds can be hypnotized.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.370
I may be a lot of things,
but weak-minded is not one of them.

11:02.453 --> 11:03.663
I have to agree.

11:04.413 --> 11:07.500
But focus on my fist like it's a magnet...

11:08.334 --> 11:10.544
pulling those memories out of your mind.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.423
Just focus on the magnet.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.717
Tell me, what do you remember

11:16.801 --> 11:19.345
before the Carringtons accused you
of starting that fire?

11:20.096 --> 11:22.932
I am seeing something. A man.

11:24.642 --> 11:25.768
A man who...

11:27.061 --> 11:29.480
thinks his fist is a bloody magnet.

11:30.398 --> 11:32.608
And I'm the one who needs therapy.

11:36.487 --> 11:39.990
I'm... so spent.

11:40.074 --> 11:42.952
You killed it out there.
-I'm impressed with Fallon.

11:43.035 --> 11:46.247
Your competitive spirit
is almost as intense as mine.

11:46.330 --> 11:48.958
Oh, no. You wiped the court with us.

11:49.041 --> 11:52.336
And I had to carry Liam's ass,
as usual.

11:55.714 --> 11:58.717
-Oh, just a business call.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.763
Well, this has been a blast,
but I have to run.

12:02.847 --> 12:06.016
-Well, this is disappointing.

12:06.100 --> 12:09.854
We were just getting to know you,
and now I wanna know everything.

12:09.937 --> 12:13.899
I want that, too, but we'll have
several days to connect before you leave.

12:14.191 --> 12:18.195
Atlanta rocks. We need to come more often.
Miguel, I love the flowers.

12:18.696 --> 12:21.615
This is so strange, Fallon.
Liam is staying here.

12:21.699 --> 12:26.162
So, why would you wanna leave instead
of being here to sleep with your husband?

12:30.374 --> 12:33.836
Her first session was more unpleasant
for me than it was for her.

12:34.753 --> 12:36.881
Kirby is a hardheaded woman.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.301
Hardheaded little bitch, is more like it.

12:41.469 --> 12:42.678
So, what'd she tell you?

12:42.761 --> 12:44.930
All I got is she remembers being blamed
for the fire.

12:45.014 --> 12:48.559
Damn it, I didn't bribe you onto the case
to hear what I already know.

12:50.144 --> 12:53.522
I need you to find out
exactly what Kirby remembers.

12:54.148 --> 12:55.232
She's a woman now.

12:55.316 --> 12:58.277
It's gonna be a hell of a lot harder
to take her ass down.

13:02.072 --> 13:04.116
I can't wait till Alexis finds out
she's no longer

13:04.200 --> 13:05.784
the most conniving mother in Atlanta.

13:05.868 --> 13:09.497
-I should set up a cage match.
-The bed's all yours. I'll take the couch.

13:09.580 --> 13:12.791
That's sweet, but that would still
be disrespectful of my fiancé.

13:12.875 --> 13:16.045
I'll slip into another bedroom
once Mommy Dearest goes to sleep.

13:16.128 --> 13:20.007
-Knock, knock.
-Oh, I guess I've been doing it wrong,

13:20.090 --> 13:21.300
knocking before I enter.

13:21.383 --> 13:23.260
You'd think I would've learned by now

13:23.344 --> 13:27.139
after walking in on Liam
doing so many... lonely things.

13:27.806 --> 13:30.935
I wanted you to have something noticeable
to sleep in.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.311
How very considerate.

13:32.394 --> 13:34.563
Oh, that's the front. Okay.

13:34.647 --> 13:35.523
Mm-hm.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.195
Once she takes her sleepy pills,
you'll be able to sneak--

13:41.278 --> 13:43.781
Oh, and I almost forgot to say,
please to keep

13:43.864 --> 13:45.908
your nighttime activities quiet.

13:46.242 --> 13:50.871
My bedroom is right across the hall,
and, well, I can hear everything.

13:59.755 --> 14:01.590
Thank you for coming, Mr. Culhane.

14:02.383 --> 14:03.551
Ada Stone.

14:03.634 --> 14:06.720
I'm sorry. There must be a mistake.
I'm meeting Vance.

14:06.804 --> 14:09.807
Like my new baby?
A 2000-year-old black granite sarcophagus

14:09.890 --> 14:13.727
discovered 16 feet underground
in Alexandria, fully sealed.

14:14.228 --> 14:15.479
He's still in there.

14:15.563 --> 14:18.774
How such a significant object managed
to slip out of Egypt

14:18.857 --> 14:22.236
and into my possession
is an excellent question.

14:22.319 --> 14:26.657
But one thing I've learned in business is
it's best not to ask questions.

14:27.366 --> 14:30.369
I've recently acquired
another valuable possession.

14:30.828 --> 14:33.789
The executed sale of Carrington Atlantic.

14:33.873 --> 14:37.293
The only copy Max Van Kirk signed
before his untimely death.

14:38.085 --> 14:40.713
You look like a serious man,
so, I'll cut to the chase.

14:40.796 --> 14:43.507
You give me a million dollars,
I'll give you the contract.

14:43.591 --> 14:46.468
Where's Vance

14:46.552 --> 14:48.721
Two questions. Ballsy.

14:49.680 --> 14:53.767
You know Vance is Max Van Kirk's attorney.
Was his attorney.

14:53.851 --> 14:55.895
But he also does consulting work for me.

14:55.978 --> 14:59.523
I have high-level consultants
in many places, Mr. Culhane.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.775
I suggest those be
your last questions now.

15:02.401 --> 15:03.444
Do we have a deal?

15:07.031 --> 15:09.909
I have no interest in doing business
with you, Ms. Stone.

15:10.701 --> 15:11.702
Thank you. Take care, homie.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.543
Thanks for letting me crash.

15:20.419 --> 15:24.340
You're the only person in my life
who hasn't tried to kick me out... yet.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.926
You are crazy.

15:27.009 --> 15:30.888
You escaped the Carringtons' psycho ward,
and you're trying to bust back in.

15:30.971 --> 15:34.224
That's certifiable.
Personally, I'm happy you're back.

15:35.142 --> 15:36.810
But if they're not treating you right,

15:36.894 --> 15:39.271
if not even your own dad
is standing up for you,

15:39.355 --> 15:40.856
then what are you doing here?

15:43.442 --> 15:44.735
Kirby?

15:44.818 --> 15:47.279
<i>Kirby.</i>

15:48.697 --> 15:49.615
Hey.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.873
I worry about that sometimes.
Did I block it out?

16:03.545 --> 16:05.673
That's exactly
what they want you to think.

16:05.756 --> 16:07.758
Lucky for you,
you are in excellent company

16:07.841 --> 16:09.677
of people the Carringtons
have screwed over.

16:14.890 --> 16:18.227
I'll admit, when you said you were
taking me out for Japanese food,

16:18.310 --> 16:20.229
I thought you meant in Atlanta.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.272
Well, why stay at home?

16:23.148 --> 16:25.275
The best Japanese restaurant
in the country

16:25.693 --> 16:27.194
is just a jaunt away in Miami.

16:27.778 --> 16:30.739
This is by far the nicest living room
that I've ever been in

16:30.823 --> 16:32.574
that's moving 600 miles an hour.

16:32.658 --> 16:36.078
Ah. You read my mind.
What do you have for us tonight?

16:36.161 --> 16:39.665
In addition to our full bar,
we have the nocturno.

16:39.748 --> 16:41.667
Features a house-made squid-ink syrup.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.837
And our classic cabin special,
the Maine lobstertini.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.673
They all sound delicious.
I'll go with a nocturno.

16:47.756 --> 16:51.093
-Oh, you should try the lobstertini.
-I really wanna try squid ink.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.804
-You'd like the lobstertini.
-Maybe on the way back.

16:54.555 --> 16:56.974
Cristal loved the lobstertini.

16:58.600 --> 17:02.521
Okay. I'll have the lobstertini
and the nocturno.

17:03.522 --> 17:04.690
It's a two-hour flight.

17:08.110 --> 17:09.028
Thank you.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.740
Why are we getting another piano?

17:12.823 --> 17:15.409
This is a Fazioli Brunei,
handmade in Italy.

17:15.951 --> 17:19.788
It's a baby grand for a baby shower
for my baby daddy.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.207
Sam, we already have a baby grand.

17:22.666 --> 17:23.792
Not in the nursery.

17:26.253 --> 17:28.756
-We have a problem.
-Don't tell me you ordered one.

17:28.839 --> 17:31.383
-You are the problem.

17:31.967 --> 17:33.177
I know I screwed up.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.596
I'm killing myself
to make you a baby shower

17:35.679 --> 17:37.890
that will be the envy of all baby showers.

17:37.973 --> 17:40.267
Exactly. You're overcompensating
on a party

17:40.350 --> 17:43.479
instead of connecting with me emotionally
about having a baby.

17:43.562 --> 17:46.440
I wanted to experience this together,
but this makes me wanna be alone.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.609
-Classic Steven.

17:48.692 --> 17:51.195
You're running away from reality,
your go-to.

17:51.278 --> 17:53.906
-Okay, reality police, illuminate me.
-My pleasure.

17:53.989 --> 17:56.158
You're projecting your baby issues onto me

17:56.241 --> 17:58.911
and avoiding the truth,
that you're not ready to be a father.

17:58.994 --> 18:00.829
What? That's outrageous.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.082
Admit it. You don't want this baby either.

18:22.142 --> 18:23.519
<i>Hey.</i>

18:23.602 --> 18:27.481
Tell me you got the contract from Vance
so I can be done with the Van Cuckoos.

18:27.564 --> 18:30.317
His people are not who
we wanna be doing business with.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.820
-Crap.
-Trust me, Fallon, I got a bad vibe.

18:32.903 --> 18:35.072
Of course I trust you. But don't worry.

18:35.155 --> 18:37.157
I'm winning Liam's mom over, somehow,

18:37.241 --> 18:39.952
so, the sale will go through
even without the contract.

18:40.035 --> 18:42.412
Then we can ditch Atlanta
and start Falhane.

18:42.496 --> 18:45.958
-You don't know how badly I want that.
-Listen, pay off the escort

18:46.041 --> 18:48.752
to keep her quiet
and then get your killer ass home.

18:49.336 --> 18:50.838
I can't wait to see you, love.

18:53.549 --> 18:56.135
-I thought I left the light on.

18:57.469 --> 19:00.931
-Oh, my brother.

19:01.014 --> 19:03.684
I can't wait to see him
at his baby shower tomorrow.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.644
Oh, you and George, you must come.

19:05.727 --> 19:08.939
George would love Steven.
They have so much in common.

19:09.439 --> 19:13.235
I didn't want the phone call to wake Liam.
He's such a light sleeper.

19:13.318 --> 19:15.320
-Oh...

19:15.404 --> 19:18.031
It's a big house.
Wouldn't want you to lose your way.

19:19.616 --> 19:20.617
Okay.

19:25.205 --> 19:29.042
I know this is all very overwhelming,
but I appreciate what you're doing.

19:29.126 --> 19:31.503
Anything I can do
to make you more comfortable?

19:31.795 --> 19:33.213
-There's one thing.
-Name it.

19:33.297 --> 19:34.798
I gotta take these shoes off.

19:34.882 --> 19:37.509
I know they cost a fortune,
but they're killing my feet.

19:37.593 --> 19:39.887
Ahem.
-Please, yes.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.182
Thank you.

19:44.349 --> 19:46.059
Oh, and the earrings. Too heavy.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.561
-Oh, don't do that.

19:47.936 --> 19:50.814
-You said I should be comfortable--

19:50.898 --> 19:54.735
Just put the damn earrings back on.
Cristal would never have done that.

19:58.697 --> 20:00.199
I wanna go back to Atlanta.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.951
-You can't just--
-This was a mistake.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.537
You said you wanted to know more
about Celia,

20:05.621 --> 20:07.706
but all you want is a date
with your dead wife.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.960
Turn the plane around, please.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.924
There will be one baby giraffe outside.

20:17.549 --> 20:22.095
-That's a compromise, so, smile.
-Steven was right. This is way too much.

20:22.804 --> 20:24.264
We're not even close to making up.

20:24.348 --> 20:27.226
Surely you didn't think this
was going to make Steven forgive you.

20:27.309 --> 20:30.604
It would've worked for me.
I'm the one making the sacrifice here.

20:30.687 --> 20:33.232
I know what it's like to raise a child
that isn't yours.

20:33.315 --> 20:35.692
But this isn't about me,
and it's not about you.

20:35.776 --> 20:36.693
It's about Steven.

20:43.659 --> 20:48.538
This was a gift from Steven's baby shower.
The theme was golden spoon.

20:48.622 --> 20:50.582
Damn it. I should've thought of that.

20:50.666 --> 20:54.461
He got lots of extravagant gifts
and one very simple one from me.

20:54.962 --> 20:58.799
Ended up being his favorite.
Steven was never into excess.

20:58.882 --> 21:02.469
He just wanted people to be there for him.
He's still the same today.

21:03.637 --> 21:07.182
He's terrified of fatherhood.
He assumes you'll be there for the baby,

21:07.266 --> 21:09.726
but what he needs
is for you to be there for him.

21:11.770 --> 21:12.854
A pillow wall?

21:13.689 --> 21:16.566
-I can just sleep on the couch.
-Your mom is suspicious.

21:16.650 --> 21:19.194
Who's to say she's not gonna drop by
in the night?

21:19.278 --> 21:22.239
Besides, my mom used to build a wall
on Steven's bed

21:22.322 --> 21:24.324
every time he brought a girl home.
It always worked.

21:24.408 --> 21:25.450
I wonder why.

21:29.705 --> 21:33.166
I used to do this to my sister's bed
when my high-school friends would visit.

21:33.250 --> 21:37.087
They only really ever wanted
to be around her. Or on her.

21:37.546 --> 21:41.883
Well, better a sister than a mom.
High-school pool parties at the Manor,

21:41.967 --> 21:44.928
all the boys would come to my yard
for Alexis' milk shakes.

21:45.012 --> 21:47.597
You wanna make this an emotional scar
I'll win.

21:47.681 --> 21:50.309
-Bring it.
-My mom forgot me in Aspen.

21:50.851 --> 21:54.938
Left me alone on a mountain
for 12 hours. I was 8.

21:55.022 --> 21:57.774
My dad sent his assistant
to my middle-school musical.

21:57.858 --> 21:58.734
I was the lead.

21:58.817 --> 22:01.111
It wasn't even his first assistant.
It was a temp.

22:01.194 --> 22:04.740
Two thousand five hunting season.
Dad shot Layla, my dachshund

22:05.407 --> 22:07.576
'cause he thought she was a fox.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.244
Damn. You win.

22:11.121 --> 22:12.414
Did you ever forgive him?

22:13.081 --> 22:14.708
He wasn't his best at the time.

22:16.126 --> 22:19.254
-He died a few months later.
-Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

22:21.631 --> 22:24.134
Right after that,
my mom had a mental breakdown.

22:26.136 --> 22:29.264
I've been scared to hurt her ever since.

22:30.348 --> 22:33.727
Which is why I sit there and say nothing
rather than telling her to shove it.

22:34.561 --> 22:36.897
It's just... easier.

22:36.980 --> 22:40.567
-It's good to stand up for yourself.

22:40.650 --> 22:41.485
Huh.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.196
You're like the Steven of the Van Kirks.

22:44.279 --> 22:46.198
Both of you turned your backs
on the business,

22:46.281 --> 22:47.699
walked away from the family.

22:47.783 --> 22:51.536
-Both of us protected by pillow walls.

22:51.620 --> 22:54.039
-I don't wanna mess up your deal.
-Lies.

22:57.292 --> 22:58.376
I don't know.

22:59.961 --> 23:02.631
For some crazy reason,
I still want her approval.

23:04.633 --> 23:07.469
-It's not stupid at all.

23:14.184 --> 23:15.268
Night.

23:18.313 --> 23:21.441
I'm pleasantly surprised
you're open to trying this again.

23:21.525 --> 23:24.027
As long as you don't try
that magnetic-hand crap.

23:24.111 --> 23:24.986
Let's give it a shot.

23:28.657 --> 23:29.741
Close your eyes.

23:31.952 --> 23:33.203
Begin to let go.

23:35.455 --> 23:36.873
Just relax.

23:38.834 --> 23:43.380
So much so that you won't mind
going asleep for a little bit.

23:45.841 --> 23:49.177
Don't let them take me away. Don't! No!

23:50.971 --> 23:52.389
I don't wanna do this anymore.

23:52.472 --> 23:54.808
-It was working.
-Let's go back to the hand.

23:54.891 --> 23:57.060
We can't stop now, Kirby.

23:57.144 --> 24:00.605
Facing it is the best way
to get the answers we're looking for.

24:00.689 --> 24:01.523
Okay?

24:08.238 --> 24:10.824
You're going to find it hard
to keep your eyes open.

24:14.202 --> 24:15.954
Blake called his divorce lawyer.

24:16.621 --> 24:19.624
It's a bump in the road.
You'll get past it. You always do.

24:19.708 --> 24:22.169
He said he'd destroy me
and I would get nothing.

24:22.252 --> 24:25.589
-If he ever found out about us--
-That's what you're worried about.

24:25.672 --> 24:26.923
That was years ago, Alexis.

24:27.007 --> 24:29.301
A night I will regret
for the rest of my life.

24:29.384 --> 24:30.468
Have you seen Kirby?

24:31.344 --> 24:34.306
That bitch let Mr. Hoppy out of his cage.
I can't find him.

24:34.389 --> 24:36.766
Well, Fallon, I'm sorry.
I'll help you find him.

24:42.898 --> 24:47.194
Kirby, what are you doing?
You shouldn't be here.

24:47.277 --> 24:48.612
You shouldn't have done this.

24:48.695 --> 24:49.946
<i>Shouldn't have done this.</i>

24:50.947 --> 24:53.158
-I gotta go.

24:53.241 --> 24:56.828
You're not allowed to leave, Kirby.
This is court-ordered therapy.

24:57.996 --> 25:00.123
Good morning, everyone.

25:00.207 --> 25:03.668
These hydrangeas look wilty.
I should probably get ahold of Miguel.

25:03.752 --> 25:06.213
Aren't you going to ask your wife
what she wants?

25:06.296 --> 25:09.007
Forgive my son, Fallon.

25:09.507 --> 25:12.177
Fallon, can I please see your plate?

25:12.802 --> 25:13.845
You're sweet.

25:14.429 --> 25:19.601
But I am an independent woman
fully capable of serving myself salmon.

25:19.684 --> 25:22.312
Well, of course
you're an independent woman.

25:22.896 --> 25:26.483
God knows you wouldn't wanna
have to rely on my eunuch son.

25:26.900 --> 25:30.028
Which is why after being married
to you for an hour, Liam,

25:30.445 --> 25:32.280
she already has someone on the side.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.241
You-- You have no idea
what you're talking about.

25:34.324 --> 25:37.035
Don't think I didn't notice those calls
to Michael.

25:37.827 --> 25:39.746
But there's nothing to be ashamed of.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.539
My son, on the other hand...

25:43.208 --> 25:46.878
Weakness. That is an inexcusable trait.
Sadly, you married the king of it.

25:47.963 --> 25:48.964
Okay.

25:50.298 --> 25:53.051
Listen up, you Joan Crawford psycho shrew.

25:53.134 --> 25:55.720
Your son doesn't fight back
not because he's weak

25:55.804 --> 25:57.597
but because he's protective of you.

25:57.681 --> 26:00.058
Or are you too much
of a self

26:00.141 --> 26:03.895
Since I met him, he's asked nothing of me,
and he's given me everything.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.647
Anyone could see his strength.

26:06.564 --> 26:08.775
But you have to look close
to see his soul.

26:09.734 --> 26:14.030
So... open your eyes, if you still can,

26:14.114 --> 26:17.284
because you have no clue
what you're missing.

26:27.085 --> 26:29.004
You had an affair with Alexis?

26:29.921 --> 26:32.799
-Don't. Don't deny it.

26:35.552 --> 26:38.013
-Alexis is right. You need to leave.
-I remember now.

26:38.096 --> 26:39.639
I watched you and Alexis have a fight.

26:39.723 --> 26:41.850
She was afraid Blake would find out
you had an affair.

26:41.933 --> 26:45.437
She saw me hiding. A few days later,
Fallon's bedroom caught on fire.

26:45.520 --> 26:46.688
Guess who got blamed.

26:46.771 --> 26:48.898
I always thought
spoiled brat Fallon did it

26:48.982 --> 26:52.027
because she wanted me gone.
But it wasn't her. It was Alexis.

26:52.569 --> 26:55.405
She needed to get rid of me
in case I let something slip.

26:56.156 --> 26:57.991
I was 12 years old, Dad.

26:58.074 --> 26:59.951
I had no idea
what that conversation meant,

27:00.035 --> 27:02.370
but I paid the price,
when it was your fault.

27:02.454 --> 27:03.538
Kirby, please.

27:04.497 --> 27:06.666
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

27:06.750 --> 27:11.171
Stop it. Stop protecting them
and taking their side over and over again.

27:11.254 --> 27:13.381
Your affair is the reason I was sent away.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.842
You were the reason
I grew up without a father.

27:15.925 --> 27:17.052
I was never crazy.

27:17.135 --> 27:20.388
This family told everyone I was,
and you chose to believe them.

27:29.814 --> 27:31.983
<i>All is good with the escort.</i>
<i>Falhane for the win.</i>

27:32.067 --> 27:34.402
We'll celebrate with champagne
when I get back.

27:34.486 --> 27:38.448
I hate to be the one to burst our bubbly,
but I screwed up big-time.

27:38.531 --> 27:41.826
-I sort of told Liam's mom to shove it.

27:41.910 --> 27:45.163
She was being rude to... the staff.
Look, I'll win her back.

27:45.246 --> 27:47.999
-It's just gonna take longer.
-You'll still be married to Liam.

27:48.416 --> 27:50.668
I am sorry, but what do you want me to do?

27:50.752 --> 27:53.338
This is the last chance we have
to get the contract.

27:56.925 --> 27:59.761
Well, well, well.
I knew you'd be back, Michael.

27:59.844 --> 28:02.806
-People don't turn me down.
-I can wire you the money in an hour.

28:03.807 --> 28:05.517
I wanna show you something first.

28:07.143 --> 28:10.647
Nice escort. Killer cheekbones.
Not a great negotiator.

28:11.356 --> 28:15.610
I gave her double what you offered.
She should have held out for more, but...

28:15.693 --> 28:17.237
I do have her story.

28:17.779 --> 28:21.032
-Your Carrington friend's in deep trouble.

28:21.366 --> 28:26.579
I wonder if Fallon's career would be over
if she went to prison for fraud.

28:27.789 --> 28:29.290
Manslaughter. Ooh.

28:31.501 --> 28:32.961
That sounds bad.

28:33.378 --> 28:35.547
But maybe it would be good for her.

28:35.630 --> 28:38.299
Cervantes went to prison
right before <i>Don Quixote</i> was published.

28:38.383 --> 28:41.636
It was only a hit because of it.
Take your contract.

28:43.054 --> 28:45.640
-I don't want your money.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.434
You're gonna be my new consultant.

28:47.517 --> 28:49.728
It just so happens I need someone
in Atlanta.

28:50.270 --> 28:54.566
Say no, and I go public with the photos
and the escort's testimony,

28:54.649 --> 28:58.153
the one she and I agreed on,
with a few embellishments, of course.

28:58.570 --> 29:02.198
See? I don't just bargain for antiques,
sweetheart.

29:03.116 --> 29:04.451
I bargain for power.

29:16.421 --> 29:19.549

29:20.800 --> 29:22.427

29:22.510 --> 29:25.722
Well, you look positively... matronly.

29:27.223 --> 29:29.559
And how is that little lottery ticket
of yours?

29:29.642 --> 29:30.769
Feeling quite at home.

29:30.852 --> 29:33.605
And you must promise to come and visit us.

29:34.314 --> 29:35.732
Alexis, a word.

29:36.274 --> 29:38.109
Oh. Excuse me.

29:38.276 --> 29:39.569

29:46.785 --> 29:49.913
-Sam went tragically overboard.
-It's nice.

29:51.706 --> 29:52.832
Thank you for lying.

29:54.459 --> 29:55.960
I'm glad you're here, though,

29:56.294 --> 29:58.880
despite your whole
"Blake being Blake" thing.

30:00.340 --> 30:02.425
Actually, it's "Blake time."

30:02.509 --> 30:03.510
Oh, I know.

30:04.928 --> 30:06.262
And I'm thankful for it.

30:08.223 --> 30:12.268
It made me realize I owe you an apology.
I've been critical of you,

30:12.352 --> 30:15.021
as a father,
as a Republican, as a gun nut.

30:15.104 --> 30:16.314
It's a terrible apology.

30:17.524 --> 30:19.192
But you were the one who stayed.

30:20.318 --> 30:23.154
You were the one who... accepted me

30:23.822 --> 30:27.492
and always welcomed me back
every time I left, no questions asked.

30:27.575 --> 30:31.913
-There were some questions.

30:32.914 --> 30:35.416
What if I am a terrible father

30:36.000 --> 30:38.378
and end up running away
just like I always do?

30:40.421 --> 30:43.424
After we lost Adam,
I was scared to have another child.

30:44.467 --> 30:48.972
I didn't know if I could love again.
It wasn't until the day that you were born

30:49.055 --> 30:51.182
that I realized how wrong I was.

30:51.724 --> 30:54.227
These things just come.
You can't force it.

30:57.146 --> 30:59.941
Sam is trying to show you
how onboard he is with it.

31:00.024 --> 31:02.277
He's not even the father.
That's something.

31:03.152 --> 31:04.362
As for you...

31:05.446 --> 31:08.324
you will feel it
when your baby's born, son. Trust me.

31:15.498 --> 31:17.709
-We're literally in a hug.

31:26.801 --> 31:29.721
<i>♪ Baby, my baby don't care for shows ♪</i>

31:29.804 --> 31:32.682
Listen, I know it's another gift

31:32.765 --> 31:36.144
and you're into the socialist
no-luxury agenda thing, but--

31:36.227 --> 31:40.189
Sam, I should've appreciated everything
you've been doing.

31:42.191 --> 31:45.528
It's not what I would've done.
I mean, not even close.

31:45.612 --> 31:46.696
You were right.

31:48.031 --> 31:49.073
I am scared.

31:50.742 --> 31:53.786
But I still wanna go
on this journey with you.

32:05.131 --> 32:08.051
-It was yours.

32:09.218 --> 32:11.387
It's humble and solid.

32:11.471 --> 32:15.183
It gave you support and comfort
when you needed it, and that's my job now.

32:18.061 --> 32:20.021
Why don't we rock this horse together?

32:20.563 --> 32:23.066
No, that was weird. I meant

32:24.776 --> 32:28.154
If you knew how to handle that hellion,
we wouldn't have this issue.

32:28.237 --> 32:32.700
I refuse to have this discussion now.
I have Melissa's thunder to steal.

32:32.784 --> 32:35.411
You were the one responsible
for sending Kirby away.

32:35.828 --> 32:38.289
-This is absurd.
-It makes perfect sense.

32:38.373 --> 32:41.250
You wanted her gone,
so, you did the most despicable--

32:41.334 --> 32:42.585
I did what I had to do.

32:42.669 --> 32:45.713
She was 12.
She didn't have a clue what was going on.

32:45.797 --> 32:49.509
She could've exposed us then.
And who knows? She could expose us now.

32:49.592 --> 32:51.260
We slept together once, Alexis.

32:51.344 --> 32:54.013
And to think that
that's why you sent Kirby away.

32:54.097 --> 32:55.932
When you didn't know what she heard.

32:56.015 --> 33:00.311
You set fire to Fallon's bedroom,
destroyed my daughter's life. For what?

33:00.395 --> 33:02.313
To protect your reputation?

33:02.981 --> 33:04.983
<i>Unless there was something else.</i>

33:06.859 --> 33:10.321
I once asked you about this,
and you said no, Alexis.

33:10.405 --> 33:12.573
Joseph, please.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.118
Am I the father?

33:19.998 --> 33:22.500
Yes. Congratulations.

33:25.294 --> 33:29.716
Don't let them take me away, please.
I didn't do it. I promise.

33:29.799 --> 33:31.884
Don't let them take me away.

33:32.468 --> 33:33.678
Please.

-It was a tense situation. -I didn't know what I was saying.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.166
Yeah. Yeah. Um...

38:09.078 --> 38:11.914
Are you kidding me? I did.
My behavior was unacceptable.

38:11.998 --> 38:15.376
I mean, you showed up this ray of light
after all the darkness.

38:16.127 --> 38:18.504
I don't deserve a second chance,
but I don't wanna lose you.

38:18.587 --> 38:20.589
Would you please stay?

38:27.596 --> 38:30.182
I don't think that would be a good idea...

38:30.850 --> 38:31.809
for either of us.

38:43.404 --> 38:45.990
I wanna thank you all
for coming to this event

38:46.073 --> 38:48.367
which has so much meaning to me,

38:48.868 --> 38:51.746
because it's a celebration of family

38:51.829 --> 38:54.498
and a new arrival in our family. And I couldn't be happier, boy or girl.

38:57.960 --> 39:01.339
I would especially like to thank Sam,
my love,

39:02.006 --> 39:04.342
for making this spectacular event happen.

39:04.884 --> 39:06.969
Well, thank Melissa.

39:07.053 --> 39:09.055
-She really made it happen.
-Oh.

39:11.182 --> 39:14.977
Now let's do this gender reveal.
It's pink for boy, right?

39:15.686 --> 39:18.647
<i>Is it a boy?</i>
<i>Is it a girl?</i>

39:20.858 --> 39:21.859
<i>Is it a boy?</i>

39:21.942 --> 39:25.780
<i>If you knew how to handle</i>
<i>that hellion, we wouldn't have this issue.</i>

39:25.863 --> 39:28.199
<i>I refuse to discuss this now, Anders.</i> <i>I have Melissa's thunder to steal.</i>

39:31.660 --> 39:34.789
<i>You're the one responsible</i>
<i>for sending Kirby away.</i>

39:34.872 --> 39:37.833
<i>This is absurd.</i>
<i>It makes perfect sense.</i>

39:37.917 --> 39:41.504
<i>You wanted her gone,</i>
<i>so, you did the most despicable--</i>

39:41.587 --> 39:43.381
<i>I did what I had to do.</i>

39:43.464 --> 39:47.802
<i>She was 12.</i>
<i>She didn't have a clue what was going on.</i>

39:48.511 --> 39:50.346
<i>She could've exposed us then.</i>

39:51.597 --> 39:52.723
Oh...

39:52.807 --> 39:55.810
Uh... I am so sorry about the confusion.

39:55.893 --> 39:57.770
Video wires must have gotten crossed.

39:57.853 --> 40:02.316
Well, the security-camera footage
was just a menial household matter.

40:02.775 --> 40:04.610
Let's get back to what's important,

40:04.693 --> 40:09.907
and that is... revealing the sex
of my grandchild.

40:10.658 --> 40:13.619
You all need to know the whole story.
The truth.

40:13.702 --> 40:15.579
This is neither the time nor the place.

40:15.663 --> 40:18.499
When is the time to tell everyone
you and Alexis had an affair?

40:19.041 --> 40:21.127
-An affair and a child.

40:21.210 --> 40:23.003
-Fallon.
-That's-- No.

40:23.087 --> 40:26.507
You have been a troubled child
since you stepped foot in this manor.

40:26.590 --> 40:29.718
Liar. You're a filthy liar, Alexis,
and everyone here knows it.

40:30.052 --> 40:31.512
I am a liar?

40:32.972 --> 40:35.724
I am sorry,
but, well, I think you all should know

40:35.808 --> 40:38.978
that the court ordered Kirby
to see a therapist,

40:39.061 --> 40:42.273
and he diagnosed her as a sociopath.

40:42.356 --> 40:44.942
-That's not true.
-He was required to report it to me

40:45.025 --> 40:49.238
-because she is a threat to my daughter.
-I am not.

40:49.321 --> 40:52.241
Kirby, we have tried
to be discreet about this.

40:52.324 --> 40:56.454
Look, I am going to make sure that you
get the best care in a secured facility.

40:56.537 --> 40:57.538
No.

40:58.205 --> 41:00.833
I heard it.
She had an affair with my father.

41:00.916 --> 41:02.001
And a child, Fallon.

41:02.084 --> 41:03.711
-You have to believe me.
Enough.

41:06.672 --> 41:08.424
Kirby is telling the truth.

41:09.675 --> 41:10.593
Anders.

41:11.302 --> 41:13.429
-Don't.
-She's right about the affair.

41:15.264 --> 41:16.849
But Fallon isn't my child.

41:16.932 --> 41:17.975
Oh, thank God.

41:23.939 --> 41:24.940
Steven is.

41:36.243 --> 41:40.206
Okay, wait, so,
my son wouldn't be a Carrington heir?

41:41.081 --> 41:44.668
I can't do this anymore.
I mean, I can just see the headlines now.

41:44.752 --> 41:46.086
"The butler did it."

41:47.755 --> 41:51.467
You're not the father, Steven.
My gyno is.
