00:03.878 --> 00:04.900
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:05.672 --> 00:06.963
I need a drink!

00:07.196 --> 00:08.482
You sound just like Dad.

00:10.001 --> 00:11.062
Dad didn't drink.

00:11.159 --> 00:14.462
Oh, no, no, I know, but your voice is deep like a man's.

00:16.551 --> 00:17.746
You want a beer?

00:17.964 --> 00:20.974
No, no. I have an audition in an hour with this great theater company,

00:21.013 --> 00:24.592
and I have to memorize a monologue from Shakespeare's Richard III.

00:24.776 --> 00:27.535
- Oh. How's that going?
- Bad.

00:29.483 --> 00:31.084
Why would you even want to do Shakespeare?

00:31.371 --> 00:33.940
Well, you know, this could be a great opportunity for me, you know?

00:33.999 --> 00:35.295
Really turn things around,

00:35.347 --> 00:37.634
get people to take me as a serious actor.

00:38.045 --> 00:39.164
Plus, I get to wear a crown.

00:41.048 --> 00:44.405
You know, maybe it would help you to memorize it if you understood the dialogue.

00:44.524 --> 00:48.211
Yeah, but it's like a whole other language.

00:48.309 --> 00:48.965
Well, let me help you.

00:49.910 --> 00:51.048
Let's start with the first line.

00:52.373 --> 00:56.003
Okay, uh, "Now is the winter of our discontent."

00:56.413 --> 00:57.359
Interesting.

00:59.039 --> 01:02.286
Uh, "made glorious summer by this sun of York."

01:02.926 --> 01:04.440
Oh, okay, sure.

01:05.657 --> 01:08.551
"And all the clouds that lowered upon our house

01:08.628 --> 01:11.534
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried."

01:17.085 --> 01:19.037
- You want to get a pizza?
- Oh, God, yes.

01:56.692 --> 01:57.794
- Hey, Michael.
- Hey!.

01:57.832 --> 01:59.337
Oh, how'd the Shakespeare audition go?

01:59.511 --> 02:02.049
I didn't get it. I'm going to be the understudy.

02:02.308 --> 02:03.176
That's great.

02:03.378 --> 02:06.002
Michael, I don't know what that means in rocket science business,

02:06.060 --> 02:08.086
but in show business, it means you suck.

02:09.455 --> 02:10.734
You're looking at this the wrong way.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.558
If the lead actor gets sick, you're in.

02:12.751 --> 02:13.716
This is an opportunity.

02:13.812 --> 02:16.172
You just need to be ready to seize it when your moment comes.

02:16.725 --> 02:18.250
- Yeah?
- Yeah, absolutely.

02:18.346 --> 02:19.832
Remember what happened to Lou Gehrig?

02:20.526 --> 02:24.450
One day, Wally Pipp got sick. Lou filled in for him.

02:24.635 --> 02:26.661
He was so good, he replaced him permanently.

02:26.718 --> 02:29.135
The guy played, like, every single game for 13 years.

02:29.363 --> 02:31.421
Michael, I can't play this part that long.

02:31.484 --> 02:33.295
I'm supposed to go to SeaWorld in three weeks.

02:34.814 --> 02:37.265
The point is you could get your big break,

02:37.463 --> 02:38.799
and you need to be ready.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.782
Yeah, I'll just wait for my chance,

02:42.922 --> 02:45.429
then I'll go out there and be the bt Richard III there ever was.

02:45.591 --> 02:48.330
Well, actually, Sir Laurence Olivier set a pretty high standard for that one.

02:49.267 --> 02:51.390
Hmm. Maybe I should put a "Sir" in front of my name.

02:53.612 --> 02:55.266
Ooh. Girl, girl. Girl, girl.

02:55.555 --> 02:56.597
Well, hello.

02:56.770 --> 02:57.407
Hi.

02:57.523 --> 02:59.221
- Let me help you with that.
- Thanks.

02:59.317 --> 03:01.343
And let me be the first to welcome you to the building.

03:01.536 --> 03:04.914
Oh, actually, I'm moving out of my apartment here and in with my fiancÃ©.

03:05.030 --> 03:06.091
Oh. Here you go.

03:10.698 --> 03:13.746
Joey, she's moving out. This is bad. This is really bad.

03:13.881 --> 03:16.289
Come on, Michael, you didn't have a chance with that girl.

03:17.002 --> 03:18.217
I could still get her. You want to see?

03:18.276 --> 03:19.298
No! Just look.

03:20.137 --> 03:21.912
An apartment is open in the building.

03:22.105 --> 03:23.803
My mother's going to want to move in.

03:24.485 --> 03:25.758
- Really?
- Yes!

03:25.855 --> 03:28.266
When I moved in, she asked me if there was an apartment open for her.

03:28.343 --> 03:29.983
God, she hates being alone,

03:30.138 --> 03:32.576
and now I'm not there anymore to do yard work or

03:32.653 --> 03:34.066
move furniture around.

03:34.158 --> 03:35.870
Whoa, whoa, uh, you move furniture?

03:36.325 --> 03:37.581
It's mostly wicker.

03:38.590 --> 03:40.422
This cannot happen. You have to help me.

03:40.519 --> 03:41.850
All right, all right, all right.

03:41.927 --> 03:43.556
Uh, well, we better take that sign down.

03:43.834 --> 03:45.609
You better just back off, mister!

03:45.763 --> 03:47.017
Oh, get the...!

03:51.635 --> 03:53.650
I didn't hit your car!

03:53.806 --> 03:55.532
You would know if I hit your car!

03:56.069 --> 03:58.031
I just totally hit that guy's car.

04:00.823 --> 04:02.078
What's going on with you guys?

04:02.135 --> 04:03.139
Nothing.

04:03.447 --> 04:06.804
Oh... what do we have here?

04:07.965 --> 04:09.557
A plant for rent?

04:10.442 --> 04:12.465
California. What a bunch of weirdos, huh?

04:12.889 --> 04:13.719
Yeah.

04:14.374 --> 04:15.455
I'll go get nner ready.

04:16.516 --> 04:17.267
Hey, guys.

04:17.461 --> 04:18.754
- Hi, Gina.
- Hey, Howie.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.151
Hey, did you notice anything different about me?

04:21.637 --> 04:22.622
Did you get shorter?

04:23.450 --> 04:25.090
No, I've been working out.

04:25.225 --> 04:26.482
I have a Bowflex.

04:26.596 --> 04:28.738
Good things are happeng to my body almost daily.

04:30.942 --> 04:33.971
Well, I can make good things happen to your body almost daily, too.

04:37.465 --> 04:38.719
I want to marry her.

04:40.571 --> 04:42.249
Hey, that's not supposed to be here.

04:42.288 --> 04:42.983
It's supposed to go over there.

04:43.060 --> 04:44.642
Well, hey, Howie, listen, uh,

04:45.066 --> 04:47.516
we don't want Gina to know about the empty apartment right now,

04:47.567 --> 04:48.821
so maybe don't mention it to her.

04:49.091 --> 04:50.056
Why can't she know?

04:50.095 --> 04:51.734
Uh, because  if she finds out, she'll move into it,

04:51.792 --> 04:53.278
and  we really don't want her living here.

04:53.355 --> 04:54.587
- She'd move in here?
- Howard...

04:54.645 --> 04:55.648
- I want that.
- Howard, no.

04:55.706 --> 04:57.635
- I'm gonna tell her. Gina!
- Howard.

05:01.108 --> 05:02.902
Do you want to have another pizza night, just you and me?

05:03.269 --> 05:05.035
That  was the best night ever!

05:05.101 --> 05:06.259
We watched Die Hard,

05:06.336 --> 05:08.538
and then you showed me your Days of Our Lives cast photo

05:08.627 --> 05:10.066
and pointed out everyone you slept with.

05:10.673 --> 05:12.570
All right, well, we can do that again

05:13.039 --> 05:15.142
if  you don't mention the empty apartment to Gina.

05:15.277 --> 05:16.609
- Really?
- Yeah, but...

05:16.802 --> 05:19.348
this time, we can Die Harder.

05:20.141 --> 05:22.757
The same thing happens, only this time, they're on a plane!

05:28.913 --> 05:30.669
Michael, guess what? Great news!

05:30.702 --> 05:33.226
The guy who plays Richard III has been throwing up all day!

05:33.295 --> 05:33.989
Really?

05:34.337 --> 05:35.610
Yeah, yeah. They think it might be serious--

05:35.649 --> 05:36.825
I'm going to get to go on!

05:36.903 --> 05:38.195
I'm so happy for you.

05:38.311 --> 05:40.708
See, I told you. So, how are the lines coming?

05:40.848 --> 05:42.698
Ah, yeah, words...

05:43.007 --> 05:44.601
the worst part of acting.

05:45.215 --> 05:48.036
I just... I can't get that opening monologue.

05:48.070 --> 05:50.764
I think I have too much information stored in my brain.

05:52.746 --> 05:54.000
It's an interesting theory.

05:55.640 --> 05:57.125
- Hey, guys.
-  Hey.

05:57.260 --> 06:00.257
Do you know what's been happening to the "for rent" signs I've been putting up?

06:00.411 --> 06:02.668
Yeah, yeah, we've been taking 'em down and tearing 'em up.

06:03.980 --> 06:05.408
And why have you been doing that?

06:05.454 --> 06:07.441
Because if my mom finds out there's an apartment here,

06:07.499 --> 06:08.883
she'll want to move in immediately.

06:09.085 --> 06:10.841
Oh. Well, that might be okay.

06:10.880 --> 06:11.844
We're getting along pretty well.

06:11.999 --> 06:12.616
Really?

06:12.674 --> 06:14.208
You think you'd want her as a tenant?

06:14.663 --> 06:16.765
Okay, let's do a little role play, all right?

06:16.880 --> 06:19.450
I'll be Gina, and you come and ask me for the rent.

06:20.421 --> 06:23.078
- Okay. Gina...
- Bite me, Blondie!

06:26.191 --> 06:27.856
That felt so real.

06:29.523 --> 06:30.854
Okay, you know what? You're right.

06:30.931 --> 06:32.224
This can't happen. She's crazy.

06:32.282 --> 06:33.671
oa, whoa, whoa, Alex.

06:33.709 --> 06:35.542
We can talk about her like that, but you can't.

06:35.641 --> 06:37.460
- That's my sister.
- Yeah, that's my mother.

06:37.759 --> 06:39.735
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

06:41.247 --> 06:42.764
Ah, we're just messing with you.

06:43.640 --> 06:44.983
She's crazy,

06:45.130 --> 06:47.641
so look, we have to find someone else to live in that apartment.

06:47.728 --> 06:48.577
Is anybody interested in it?

06:48.654 --> 06:50.506
No. I was thinking of having an open house.

06:50.564 --> 06:51.740
Oh, oh, have one tomorrow.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.708
She has to go to San Diego for a wig convention.

06:53.766 --> 06:56.767
Ooh, San Diego. Only 20 more days till SeaWorld.

06:58.495 --> 07:00.019
Okay, this can totally work.

07:00.058 --> 07:02.082
I-I just have to rent it to someone by tomorrow.

07:02.633 --> 07:03.848
I just wish my husband were here.

07:03.925 --> 07:05.490
He's t real salesman in the family.

07:05.601 --> 07:06.469
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

07:06.495 --> 07:09.054
The last apartment we had open, he rend no problem,

07:09.327 --> 07:10.735
even though there was bad plumbing,

07:10.813 --> 07:11.955
faulty heating,

07:12.053 --> 07:13.153
and there's mold in the walls.

07:14.022 --> 07:16.208
Uh, weren't we the last people to move in?

07:16.997 --> 07:18.802
So, SeaWorld, huh?

07:31.622 --> 07:33.819
All hail King Meatball.

07:35.574 --> 07:37.329
Hey, you gonna come see my play tonight, right?

07:37.387 --> 07:39.836
Pass up a chance to see you in makeup and tights?

07:39.878 --> 07:41.369
That's going to be my Christmas card.

07:42.764 --> 07:44.178
So, you ready to go on?

07:44.249 --> 07:47.434
Yeah, yeah, I got everything down except that damn opening monologue.

07:47.927 --> 07:49.520
Hey, what do you think about sitting in the front row

07:49.559 --> 07:50.897
and mouthing the words to me.

07:51.104 --> 07:51.895
I don't know it.

07:51.953 --> 07:53.494
You know it better than I do.

07:57.802 --> 07:58.419
Hello.

07:58.867 --> 07:59.500
Uh-huh.

08:01.299 --> 08:01.996
Oh.

08:03.209 --> 08:03.943
Okay.

08:04.550 --> 08:06.085
Uh-huh. Thanks. Bye.

08:07.131 --> 08:08.588
Uh-oh.

08:08.828 --> 08:10.337
Paternity test results?

08:12.508 --> 08:15.371
No, that was the theater calling. I'm going on tonight.

08:15.586 --> 08:16.556
You knew that.

08:16.679 --> 08:18.456
Different theater. Different play.

08:20.001 --> 08:20.700
What?!

08:21.212 --> 08:23.998
Well, I liked understudying so much, I took another job.

08:24.125 --> 08:25.842
I over-understudied!

08:27.805 --> 08:28.943
Now, why would you do that?

08:29.001 --> 08:31.760
Well, I figured if I understudied in more than one thing,

08:31.818 --> 08:33.964
it'd increase my odds of getting on stage.

08:34.308 --> 08:37.429
You know, you think just enough to really screw things up for yourself.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.017
I know, I know! I can't believe this.

08:41.164 --> 08:43.875
What are the chances that two people getting sick at the same time?!

08:43.886 --> 08:44.968
Well, it's flu season.

08:45.103 --> 08:46.337
Get a flu shot!

08:46.415 --> 08:47.611
You didn't get a flu shot.

08:47.669 --> 08:49.127
I'm not in a play!

08:50.874 --> 08:52.144
What am I going to do?

08:52.523 --> 08:55.166
Hey, Joey, there was a weird phone message for you.

08:55.262 --> 08:57.693
Your producer called, said you were going on tonight.

08:57.809 --> 08:59.082
Yeah, yeah, yeah, honey. He knows already.

08:59.160 --> 09:00.694
He's in two plays tonight.

09:01.060 --> 09:03.175
Actually, I should hear this.

09:04.095 --> 09:04.983
Well, okay, the message was

09:05.079 --> 09:07.452
"Trent's stuck in Florida, so they need you to play the part of Gus."

09:07.510 --> 09:09.054
You're in three plays?

09:09.092 --> 09:11.656
God! I was afraid it was Gus!

09:11.956 --> 09:13.017
Damn it, Trent!

09:13.133 --> 09:15.100
Unprofessional! Unprofessional! Unprofessional!

09:16.493 --> 09:18.093
So, what's the third play about?

09:21.837 --> 09:23.478
I don't remember!

09:24.378 --> 09:25.958
Joey, what are you going to do?

09:26.074 --> 09:28.099
I don't know. I-I can only do one.

09:28.138 --> 09:29.836
Don't do the one with the monologue in it,

09:29.874 --> 09:30.926
'cause you don't know that very well.

09:30.984 --> 09:34.088
Yeah, but I haven't studied the dancing in that cowboy thing at all.

09:39.847 --> 09:40.965
I don't know it!

09:42.374 --> 09:44.102
Oh, please, do that one.

09:45.403 --> 09:46.406
I can't believe this.

09:46.464 --> 09:47.236
What are the chances?

09:47.294 --> 09:49.669
It's like everything is lining up to screw me!

09:49.844 --> 09:52.229
It's the understudy perfect storm!

10:00.381 --> 10:01.327
Joey!

10:01.519 --> 10:02.947
Thank you for coming in.

10:03.237 --> 10:04.954
Listen, the reason that I called is...

10:05.257 --> 10:07.360
No,  no, no, no. You-You didn't call me. I called you.

10:07.572 --> 10:08.903
Oh, good.

10:10.312 --> 10:12.331
I was just about to make something up.

10:13.772 --> 10:16.550
Okay, look, Bobbie, I got a real problem, and I need your help.

10:16.646 --> 10:18.441
I took an understudy role in this play...

10:18.614 --> 10:20.824
Oh, no! I hate plays!

10:22.179 --> 10:23.275
No, that's not the problem.

10:23.410 --> 10:25.051
Oh, it gets worse?!

10:25.750 --> 10:28.296
Well, I signed up to understudy in three different plays,

10:28.431 --> 10:30.109
and they all want me to go on tonight.

10:30.513 --> 10:31.166
What?!

10:33.119 --> 10:36.518
Oh, why can't you just have a coke problem like everyone else?

10:38.131 --> 10:39.731
I'll give that some thought.

10:40.637 --> 10:42.797
All right,you have to do three plays at once.

10:42.894 --> 10:45.672
Well, lucky for you, I am the queen of multitasking.

10:46.131 --> 10:47.713
Right now, as we are talking,

10:47.829 --> 10:49.570
I am doing butt clenches,

10:49.724 --> 10:53.234
and I'm learning Spanish in this ear piece.

10:53.714 --> 10:55.398
Me llamo Bobbie.

10:56.828 --> 11:00.020
I'm trying to seduce a Mexican soap star.

11:01.424 --> 11:04.708
All right, let's see if we can juggle these.

11:06.045 --> 11:08.754
All three plays are at the same time?

11:08.906 --> 11:09.890
Uh, no, no, no.

11:10.045 --> 11:11.414
One starts a little earlier.

11:11.627 --> 11:13.479
Oh, and one I'm not in until the second act.

11:13.672 --> 11:14.308
Great!

11:14.463 --> 11:15.863
So, you can do both of those.

11:16.094 --> 11:20.111
And for the third, maybe we can get the actor to go on.

11:20.512 --> 11:21.612
How am I going to do that?

11:21.708 --> 11:25.368
Well, I'd offer to call ani threaten to ruin his career,

11:25.548 --> 11:27.556
but it couldn't get much worse.

11:27.653 --> 11:28.810
He's doing a play.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.802
Oh, uh... maybe I can just go talk to him.

11:32.994 --> 11:34.113
You do that.

11:34.248 --> 11:35.773
You'll think of something to say.

11:36.337 --> 11:38.108
You're a big, bright guy.

11:38.270 --> 11:39.741
Yeah, yeah, I get that a lot.

11:41.555 --> 11:42.114
Really?

11:44.449 --> 11:47.478
Well, enough of that "Â¿DÃ³nde esta la playa?" crap.

11:48.563 --> 11:51.322
How do you say, "Take off my bra"?

11:52.499 --> 11:53.907
Quitame mi brassiÃ¨re.

12:02.589 --> 12:04.634
Hey, Alex, how's the open house going?

12:04.673 --> 12:07.557
Okay. We've had a few bites, but no one's really interested.

12:07.897 --> 12:10.496
Oh, did you mention there's a celebrity living in the complex?

12:10.565 --> 12:11.999
There is? Who?

12:12.164 --> 12:13.903
Uh, Sir Joey Tribbiani.

12:15.307 --> 12:17.156
Oh, yeah. Well, let's keep that quiet.

12:17.272 --> 12:19.457
We don't want the paparazzi crawling around here.

12:19.841 --> 12:21.346
Oh, yeah. I hate those bastards.

12:21.384 --> 12:23.063
Always following me around in their helicopters.

12:25.270 --> 12:26.505
All right, well, you'd better rent it soon,

12:26.620 --> 12:28.607
'cause Gina's going to be back from San Diego in a couple of hours.

12:28.685 --> 12:30.440
Okay, well, I'm doing the best I can.

12:30.488 --> 12:32.288
It's not like I've got the greatest prospects here.

12:32.354 --> 12:33.897
Well, look, don't be so choosy, all right?

12:33.955 --> 12:36.789
The important thing is to rent it to someone who's not my sister.

12:36.972 --> 12:38.631
All right? And maybe someone who's hot.

12:38.689 --> 12:40.194
And has Hollywood connections.

12:40.309 --> 12:42.065
- And HDTV!
- Get out of here!

12:45.516 --> 12:46.210
Hey, Michael.

12:47.117 --> 12:50.088
Hey, looks like there's a lot of people at the open... Hi, Gina.

12:51.305 --> 12:52.316
You're here!

12:52.351 --> 12:53.643
Uh, what happened to your wig convention?

12:53.740 --> 12:55.267
Oh, a lot of stylists came down with the flu,

12:55.383 --> 12:57.282
so they canceled the whole thing.

12:57.357 --> 12:59.097
Flu, you are killing me.

13:00.228 --> 13:01.790
All right, Michael, I'm just gonna get your laundry,

13:01.887 --> 13:02.524
and I'll be on my way.

13:02.562 --> 13:03.392
Okay, Ma.

13:04.646 --> 13:06.459
How  long has she been here? Did she see the open house?

13:06.498 --> 13:07.808
No, she came before it started,

13:07.846 --> 13:09.428
but now she has to stay 'till it's over.

13:09.448 --> 13:11.145
So, how are we gonna keep her here?

13:11.223 --> 13:13.615
Uh... Oh, wait. Keeping her here will be easy.

13:13.692 --> 13:15.197
What's her favorite thing to do in the world?

13:15.313 --> 13:16.625
Uh... telling us what to do.

13:16.663 --> 13:17.435
Be more specific.

13:17.514 --> 13:18.595
Uh, telling me what to do.

13:18.652 --> 13:19.289
Exactly.

13:19.405 --> 13:21.315
So, just ask her advice about something.

13:21.450 --> 13:22.511
Uh, like, what?

13:22.646 --> 13:23.746
Uh, all right, don't worry, I'll help.

13:23.823 --> 13:25.476
I've been working on improv with my new theater company.

13:25.553 --> 13:27.318
Watch me think on my feet.

13:28.230 --> 13:29.369
This is scary.

13:30.488 --> 13:32.436
All right, I got your laundry. I'm gonna take off.

13:32.494 --> 13:33.246
Okay, Mom, you know what?

13:33.304 --> 13:36.878
Stay. Just 'cause I want to talk. I have a problem.

13:36.906 --> 13:37.735
With what?

13:37.909 --> 13:39.279
Well, it's a problem with...

13:39.336 --> 13:40.089
A girl.

13:40.224 --> 13:41.758
Yes, with-with a girl.

13:42.067 --> 13:44.885
- Really? What's her name?
- Raisin.

13:49.689 --> 13:52.525
Yes, uh, her-her name is Raisin, and she's a little bit...

13:52.582 --> 13:53.219
Cajun!

13:55.632 --> 13:56.675
Sh-She's a little bit Cajun.

13:56.733 --> 13:58.762
And her father's a dirty cop!

13:59.434 --> 14:01.421
Okay, I'm glad you came to me about this.

14:01.440 --> 14:02.448
Here's what you're gonna do.

14:02.505 --> 14:05.522
Wait, you actually have some advice about my Cajun girlfriend Raisin?

14:07.482 --> 14:10.007
First, there's a few things that you two need to get straight, okay?

14:10.059 --> 14:11.139
Okay, great. I'm taking off.

14:11.285 --> 14:12.404
Joey, where are you going?

14:12.520 --> 14:13.774
It turns out, time-wise,

14:13.871 --> 14:16.205
I can still do Richard III, and then make it across town

14:16.244 --> 14:17.756
for the second act in the cowboy musical.

14:17.794 --> 14:20.399
So now, I got to convince the sick actor in the third play

14:20.438 --> 14:22.356
that he's well enough to go on instead of me.

14:29.289 --> 14:30.669
Okay, I'm ready.

14:36.387 --> 14:37.776
Hey, Tim.

14:39.347 --> 14:40.485
Who are you?

14:41.874 --> 14:43.831
It's me, Joey, your understudy.

14:43.897 --> 14:45.102
What are you doing here?

14:45.160 --> 14:46.395
Oh, ah, your roommate let me in.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.267
I just really wanted to thank you

14:48.420 --> 14:49.806
for giving me the chance to go on tonight.

14:49.845 --> 14:52.146
And I want you know to know that I am not gonna let you down.

14:52.326 --> 14:54.202
I've been busy making the role of Harry my own.

14:54.221 --> 14:55.425
You mean Henry.

14:56.900 --> 14:58.559
Good thing I'm getting out of this one.

14:59.927 --> 15:02.435
Anyway, I-I just wanted to tell you a little story, Tim.

15:02.493 --> 15:03.535
Do you like baseball?

15:03.612 --> 15:06.769
Not really. But I like A-Rod. He's yummy.

15:08.201 --> 15:09.547
Amen. Hmm.

15:10.514 --> 15:13.329
Yeah, anyway, uh, you remind me of this first baseman, Wally Pipp.

15:13.549 --> 15:16.090
Why? Did he die with an understudy in his room?

15:18.201 --> 15:18.973
No...

15:19.709 --> 15:22.904
no, but he was sick one day, and he allowed a young, no-name backup

15:22.992 --> 15:24.330
to come into the game for him.

15:24.422 --> 15:26.062
And he never made it back into the lineup.

15:26.081 --> 15:27.470
- You know why?
- Why?

15:27.566 --> 15:30.456
Because his replacement turned out to be Lou Gehrig,

15:30.712 --> 15:32.641
one of the most beloved figures in baseball,

15:32.719 --> 15:34.956
hitting almost 500 home runs.

15:37.325 --> 15:39.940
- You do know what a home run is?
- I'm not that gay.

15:41.640 --> 15:42.491
Sorry.

15:42.662 --> 15:44.958
Anyway, I just, uh, just wanted to leave you with that little story

15:44.997 --> 15:47.965
before I go out tonight and act one out of the park.

15:48.125 --> 15:50.774
Wait, why are you telling me this? Are you threatening me?

15:50.870 --> 15:51.912
If I was, would it work?

15:52.114 --> 15:54.793
Is this a kind of All About Eve situation?

15:55.399 --> 15:56.843
If it was, would it work?

15:58.241 --> 16:00.312
You know, maybe I am starting to feel a little better.

16:00.505 --> 16:01.546
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:01.624 --> 16:03.090
I think I can go on tonight.

16:03.262 --> 16:04.709
Well, hey, if that's what you want, Tim,

16:04.728 --> 16:06.525
I'm not gonna be the one to stop you.

16:06.613 --> 16:08.328
If only I hadn't stopped by!

16:09.523 --> 16:11.587
You  know, coming in here and trying to talk me into going on--

16:11.664 --> 16:13.811
you may be the worst understudy ever.

16:13.947 --> 16:15.376
You have no idea.

16:21.054 --> 16:22.771
Hey, did you rent the apartment yet?

16:22.887 --> 16:23.967
I did, finally.

16:23.909 --> 16:26.649
Actually, to a really nice girl who just moved here from New York.

16:26.726 --> 16:27.556
Uh-oh.

16:27.671 --> 16:29.842
I hope it's not someone I slept with and never called back.

16:31.270 --> 16:33.064
I doubt it. I mean, what are the odds?

16:33.180 --> 16:34.850
Actually, quite high, yeah.

16:35.340 --> 16:36.873
Come on, let's go tell Michael the good news.

16:37.834 --> 16:40.053
Well, she really sounds worth fighting for,

16:40.149 --> 16:42.195
but, remember, the Cajun are an emotional people.

16:44.124 --> 16:46.324
Okay, Mom. Uh, thanks for the advice.

16:46.418 --> 16:47.653
And I want to meet this Raisin.

16:47.713 --> 16:49.752
Oh, that's actually gonna be difficult, 'cause she lives...

16:49.857 --> 16:50.880
In a submarine.

16:56.089 --> 16:57.420
She, uh... She lives on a submarine.

16:58.636 --> 17:00.065
All right. I'm gonna take off.

17:00.466 --> 17:01.973
Okay, okay.

17:02.313 --> 17:03.971
Keeping this secret's been torturing me.

17:04.053 --> 17:04.960
I can't eat,

17:04.999 --> 17:06.069
I can't sleep,

17:06.248 --> 17:07.499
I can barely Bowflex.

17:08.650 --> 17:11.255
Gina, there's an apartment for rent across the way.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.032
What?!

17:13.207 --> 17:14.673
They didn't want me to tell you, but,

17:14.789 --> 17:16.039
I want you to live here.

17:16.468 --> 17:19.311
I think you deserve to know 'cause you're super, super pretty.

17:20.529 --> 17:22.111
No more Die Hard for you, Howie.

17:22.169 --> 17:24.275
Really? 'Cause I just ordered pizza.

17:24.449 --> 17:25.876
Bring it down, and we'll talk.

17:29.329 --> 17:30.255
Did you know about this?

17:30.371 --> 17:32.568
Hey, hey, hey, she had nothing to do with it.

17:32.602 --> 17:34.975
It's true. I-I would have rented it to you in a second.

17:35.072 --> 17:36.847
I love having you around. In fact...

17:36.924 --> 17:38.873
- Bite me, Blondie.
- Okay.

17:42.383 --> 17:45.083
Wow. So, all day you've been trying to keep me

17:45.122 --> 17:46.723
from finding out about this place.

17:47.071 --> 17:49.348
You guys must have really not wanted me to live here, huh?

17:49.484 --> 17:50.892
Look, Gina, I just...

17:50.988 --> 17:52.841
I just thought it would be better for Michael.

17:52.898 --> 17:56.793
Look, Mom, I'm sorry. I just...

17:57.603 --> 17:58.876
I like things the way they are.

17:58.915 --> 18:00.130
I like having my own space.

18:02.658 --> 18:03.325
Me, too.

18:05.206 --> 18:05.939
What?

18:07.106 --> 18:09.228
Look, there was a time, not too long ago,

18:09.286 --> 18:11.914
when I would have wanted to live the and be closer to you.

18:12.355 --> 18:14.832
But I have to say, this is kind of working out for me.

18:15.275 --> 18:17.359
I mean, I went straight from being a kid to raising a kid.

18:17.417 --> 18:19.171
I've never rlly lived alone before.

18:20.215 --> 18:22.013
I've never lived alone, either.

18:23.848 --> 18:25.417
And it's scary,

18:25.966 --> 18:27.084
but it's nice.

18:27.767 --> 18:29.352
I gothe whole place to myself.

18:29.382 --> 18:31.678
I can listen to bad music whenever I want.

18:31.736 --> 18:33.549
I can light my smelly candles that you hate,

18:33.607 --> 18:35.074
and I can take super-long baths.

18:35.189 --> 18:37.264
He's always interrupting my baths!

18:40.010 --> 18:43.173
I guess I'm figuring out who I am away from you,

18:43.418 --> 18:44.556
and it's strange,

18:45.510 --> 18:47.268
but I'm kind of having fun.

18:48.987 --> 18:49.798
What?

18:53.018 --> 18:54.812
It's just, it's-it's weird. You know?

18:54.947 --> 18:57.378
I-I guess, I didn't want you to smother me,

18:57.436 --> 18:59.052
but now that you're not doing it anymore,

18:59.430 --> 19:00.703
it's actually kind of sad.

19:00.819 --> 19:02.427
You know, I guess things are changing.

19:03.925 --> 19:04.776
Yeah.

19:05.937 --> 19:08.580
In fact, maybe you should start doing your own laundry.

19:11.301 --> 19:14.330
And maybe you guys should start cooking for yourselves, too.

19:14.407 --> 19:16.900
Hey, you are this boy's mother!

19:30.370 --> 19:32.432
Now is the winter of our discontent...

19:34.620 --> 19:35.961
What's the next line?

19:36.996 --> 19:38.134
What's the next line?!

19:39.827 --> 19:41.178
Oh, God, please,

19:41.352 --> 19:43.898
help me get through this, and I promise, from now on,

19:43.918 --> 19:46.675
I will not understudy for more than two plays at once.

19:57.894 --> 20:01.053
Now is the winter of our discontent

20:02.105 --> 20:05.897
Made glorious summer by this son of York,

20:06.490 --> 20:10.284
And all the clouds that lowered upon our house

20:10.774 --> 20:13.495
in the deep bosom of the ocean buried.

20:14.170 --> 20:18.941
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,

20:19.271 --> 20:22.242
Our bruisÃ¨d arms hung up for monuments,

20:22.667 --> 20:26.590
Our stern alarms changed to merry meetings,

20:26.868 --> 20:31.440
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.

20:50.961 --> 20:53.595
Also, enjoy the cowboys!

20:59.401 --> 21:01.619
An all new Will & Grace is coming up nest

21:01.677 --> 21:03.861
right here on NBC.

21:05.029 --> 21:07.412
I can't believe I finally nailed that speech.

21:07.622 --> 21:09.502
It was in the wrong play but still...

21:10.305 --> 21:13.003
