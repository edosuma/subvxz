WEBVTT

00:01.127 --> 00:02.918
-<i> Last year, a competition</i>

00:02.962 --> 00:05.629
<i>was created to test the
nation's best bladesmiths.</i>

00:05.673 --> 00:08.007
<i>Thousands responded,
and this year,</i>

00:08.050 --> 00:09.842
<i>craftsmen from all over
the country</i>

00:09.885 --> 00:12.094
<i>and all walks of life
have come forward</i>

00:12.138 --> 00:13.929
<i>for their chance
to claim the title.</i>

00:13.973 --> 00:15.597
- I'm gonna be the next
"Forged in Fire" champion.

00:15.641 --> 00:16.932
- I want to win!

00:16.976 --> 00:18.392
- It would be a life-changing
moment.

00:18.436 --> 00:19.852
- Welcome to the Forge.

00:19.895 --> 00:22.396
<i>Now the Forge returns
with challenges</i>

00:22.440 --> 00:24.690
<i>unlike anything ever
seen before.</i>

00:24.734 --> 00:26.442
- You'll be using this.

00:26.485 --> 00:30.070
<i>Skill and ingenuity
will be pushed to the limit.</i>

00:30.114 --> 00:32.156
<i>Some will rise to the challenge.</i>

00:32.199 --> 00:33.615
<i>Some will fall.</i>

00:33.659 --> 00:35.619
<i>But only the best
will be crowned</i>

00:35.661 --> 00:37.369
<i>"Forged in Fire" champions</i>

00:37.413 --> 00:39.621
<i>and take home $10,000.</i>

00:39.665 --> 00:42.624
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

00:42.668 --> 00:45.627
<i>¶ ¶</i>

00:45.671 --> 00:49.590
<i>[rock music]</i>

00:49.633 --> 00:51.258
<i>- My name is Kelly Potter.</i>

00:51.302 --> 00:53.969
<i>I've been smithing for about
five years now.</i>

00:54.013 --> 00:56.889
I like the really
labor-intensive part of it

00:56.932 --> 01:00.350
and getting really dirty
and messy and hot.

01:00.394 --> 01:03.312
<i>- My name is Jason Ritchie,
but I go by Ritchie.</i>

01:03.355 --> 01:05.022
<i>Other than being a blacksmith,</i>

01:05.066 --> 01:07.024
I'm a labor worker for a company

01:07.068 --> 01:09.818
that does prefab
steel buildings.

01:09.862 --> 01:11.445
<i>- My name is Josh Weston.</i>

01:11.489 --> 01:14.531
<i>I got into bladesmithing
from "Spartacus."</i>

01:14.575 --> 01:18.077
Something inside of me
lit on fire,

01:18.120 --> 01:21.121
<i>and I had to make swords.</i>

01:21.165 --> 01:23.207
<i>- I'm Jason Redick.</i>

01:23.250 --> 01:25.084
I started making blades
when I was a kid

01:25.127 --> 01:26.752
with my grandfather.

01:26.796 --> 01:29.755
I'm 100% self-taught.

01:29.799 --> 01:31.799
<i>¶</i> ¶

01:31.842 --> 01:34.343
- Welcome to the Forge, smiths.

01:34.386 --> 01:37.179
You're here to engage
in three rounds of competition

01:37.223 --> 01:39.723
specifically designed
to evaluate

01:39.767 --> 01:43.060
every aspect
of edged-weapons forging.

01:43.104 --> 01:44.895
After each round,

01:44.939 --> 01:46.939
you'll hand your work over
to our panel of expert judges...

01:46.982 --> 01:50.150
Internationally known master
bladesmith J. Neilson,

01:50.194 --> 01:52.945
historic weapons re-creation
specialist David Baker,

01:52.988 --> 01:57.032
globally recognized weapons
specialist Doug Marcaida.

01:57.076 --> 01:58.742
They will decide which of you

01:58.786 --> 02:00.702
will be the "Forged in Fire"
champion

02:00.746 --> 02:04.623
and leave here with a check
for $10,000.

02:04.667 --> 02:07.334
In the barrel in front of you
are four rods.

02:07.378 --> 02:10.796
Connected to those rods are
four different types of metal...

02:10.840 --> 02:14.800
Cable, ball bearing,
brick, and spring.

02:14.844 --> 02:18.053
Your first-round challenge
is to take that steel

02:18.097 --> 02:20.764
and forge a blade
in your signature style.

02:20.808 --> 02:23.267
The order
has been randomly chosen.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.435
Jason, you're up first.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.062
Choose your steel.

02:27.106 --> 02:28.564
- I would prefer to have,
like, the steel cable.

02:28.607 --> 02:32.693
I actually really enjoy
working cable.

02:32.736 --> 02:35.028
- Jason, you've chosen
the brick.

02:35.072 --> 02:39.658
- The metal I pulled
is the one I didn't want.

02:39.702 --> 02:42.911
- Josh, you're up next.
Go ahead and choose.

02:42.955 --> 02:46.498
- I want the cable.

02:46.542 --> 02:49.626
- Josh, you drew the cable.
Good luck.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.545
<i>- What a relief.</i>

02:51.589 --> 02:56.091
There's a lot of material
to work with, so I'm excited.

02:56.135 --> 02:58.135
- Kelly, your turn.

02:58.179 --> 03:03.223
<i>¶</i> ¶

03:03.267 --> 03:06.518
Kelly, you've chosen
the spring steel.

03:06.562 --> 03:08.270
- I choose the spring steel,

03:08.314 --> 03:10.856
and I'm not excited
about uncoiling it.

03:10.900 --> 03:12.191
[chuckles]

03:12.234 --> 03:15.152
- Ritchie, there's only
one option left.

03:15.196 --> 03:17.196
You get the ball bearing.

03:17.239 --> 03:19.281
<i>- The metal I'd really love
to work with is spring steel,</i>

03:19.325 --> 03:21.575
and, of course, I end up
with the ball bearing,

03:21.619 --> 03:24.036
which I have never
worked with before,

03:24.079 --> 03:25.746
and I'm pretty damn nervous.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.414
[chuckles]

03:27.458 --> 03:28.999
- The blades themselves

03:29.043 --> 03:31.293
must fall within the following
size parameters...

03:31.337 --> 03:34.755
<i>The length of the blade,
not including the tang,</i>

03:34.798 --> 03:37.925
<i>must be between 9 and 12 inches.</i>

03:37.968 --> 03:39.760
<i>The overall length of the weapon</i>

03:39.803 --> 03:42.888
<i>must not exceed 22 inches.</i>

03:42.932 --> 03:44.389
You need to remember...

03:44.433 --> 03:49.186
That blade has to be
a double-edged dagger.

03:49.230 --> 03:51.063
<i>A double-edged dagger
has two edges</i>

03:51.106 --> 03:54.900
<i>that can be used
when defending or striking.</i>

03:54.944 --> 03:57.402
You will have ten minutes
to work on your design.

03:57.446 --> 04:00.113
You will have three hours
to forge your blades.

04:00.157 --> 04:01.573
Good luck, bladesmiths.

04:01.617 --> 04:03.742
Your time starts now.

04:03.786 --> 04:07.371
<i>¶</i> ¶

04:07.414 --> 04:09.122
<i>- My style of bladesmithing...</i>

04:09.166 --> 04:11.750
I probably lean a little more
towards the rustic style.

04:11.794 --> 04:16.004
I kind of like stuff
from, like, fur trade era.

04:16.048 --> 04:18.465
<i>I am making a camp knife.</i>

04:18.509 --> 04:20.926
<i>Basically, I'm gonna worry
about what I have to do.</i>

04:20.970 --> 04:22.511
<i>I'm not gonna worry too much</i>

04:22.554 --> 04:24.054
about what everybody else
is doing,

04:24.098 --> 04:26.014
because if you spend time
worrying about that,

04:26.058 --> 04:28.183
<i>you're not gonna get done
what you need to do.</i>

04:28.227 --> 04:30.018
<i>¶ ¶</i>

04:30.062 --> 04:33.313
- I really prefer
the Viking Age.

04:33.357 --> 04:35.148
<i>I'm making a seax.</i>

04:35.192 --> 04:36.650
<i>It can do everything,</i>

04:36.694 --> 04:41.238
and it's mean,
and it's gorgeous.

04:41.282 --> 04:43.615
<i>- I'm designing a punch dagger.</i>

04:43.659 --> 04:46.952
The handle of a punch dagger
comes out in sort of a T-shape,

04:46.996 --> 04:50.622
so you punch with it, as opposed
to thrusting with it normally.

04:50.666 --> 04:53.041
<i>I'm a little concerned
about how this ball of steel</i>

04:53.085 --> 04:54.793
<i>is gonna stretch out</i>

04:54.837 --> 04:56.962
and I don't want to leave myself
without enough blade,

04:57.006 --> 04:58.630
<i>without enough thickness
of blade,</i>

04:58.674 --> 05:01.550
<i>because I want to make
something nice and strong.</i>

05:01.593 --> 05:04.052
<i>- I'm going pretty
straightforward in my design</i>

05:04.096 --> 05:06.972
just because I'm very familiar
with my own limits.

05:07.016 --> 05:10.684
<i>I'm gonna make a dagger
that's Scottish-inspired,</i>

05:10.728 --> 05:13.812
<i>but overall
my design's pretty simple.</i>

05:13.856 --> 05:15.897
<i>People shouldn't
underestimate me,</i>

05:15.941 --> 05:17.941
<i>because even though I'm a girl,</i>

05:17.985 --> 05:20.777
I can definitely hammer
with the best of them.

05:20.821 --> 05:24.781
- Bladesmiths, your 10-minute
design window is now closed.

05:24.825 --> 05:28.702
Your 3-hour forging time
starts...

05:28.746 --> 05:29.746
now.

05:29.788 --> 05:34.333
<i>¶</i> ¶

05:34.376 --> 05:38.295
- All of the other contestants
have solid chunks of steel.

05:38.339 --> 05:41.465
<i>I have to forge-weld
this thing together.</i>

05:41.508 --> 05:43.008
- Josh has cable,

05:43.052 --> 05:44.843
so the best thing
you would say is basically

05:44.887 --> 05:48.805
un-twist it, flux it,
twist, flux it.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.932
- Open it up first,
flux the whole thing,

05:50.976 --> 05:53.018
let it cook in there for a sec,

05:53.062 --> 05:54.811
close it back up.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.689
- And we're not talking
about unspooling.

05:57.733 --> 06:01.026
We're just talking
about barely opening it up.

06:01.070 --> 06:03.236
<i>- I'm trying to get
this twist going</i>

06:03.280 --> 06:06.782
and turn it into a billet
that I can now use,

06:06.825 --> 06:09.534
<i>which is gonna put me
40-some minutes</i>

06:09.578 --> 06:11.411
<i>behind everybody else.</i>

06:11.455 --> 06:14.331
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

06:14.375 --> 06:16.500
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

06:16.543 --> 06:17.959
You're kidding me.

06:18.003 --> 06:19.836
Josh has gone right to the press

06:19.880 --> 06:22.672
without cleaning
the inside of that cable.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.967
<i>- My worst fear actually
just popped right out.</i>

06:26.011 --> 06:28.345
<i>I'm getting this
gnarly rat's nest</i>

06:28.389 --> 06:30.764
and it just went...
[imitates spring popping]

06:30.808 --> 06:32.516
<i>And I'm like...</i>

06:32.559 --> 06:33.934
"[bleep]."

06:33.977 --> 06:36.728
Gnarliest start ever.

06:36.772 --> 06:38.730
[bleep].

06:38.774 --> 06:41.024
<i>- My strategy is
to go pretty simple</i>

06:41.068 --> 06:43.026
<i>just so I know I can finish.</i>

06:43.070 --> 06:44.945
I'm not trying
to do anything fancy

06:44.988 --> 06:47.739
just because I don't want to be
the one at the end being like,

06:47.783 --> 06:50.409
"Sorry."

06:50.452 --> 06:54.079
<i>The first thing I do is throw
my spring steel into the forge.</i>

06:54.123 --> 06:55.705
<i>I want to get it good and hot</i>

06:55.749 --> 06:59.626
so I can hopefully flatten it
back out.

06:59.670 --> 07:02.295
- Kelly did exactly
what I hoped she wouldn't do.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.881
She's got enough steel right
there to make three daggers,

07:04.925 --> 07:07.008
and she just put the whole thing
in the forge,

07:07.052 --> 07:08.301
which means she's intending

07:08.345 --> 07:10.387
on trying to pull that apart
and spread it,

07:10.431 --> 07:13.432
where she could have
just cut it in half.

07:13.475 --> 07:16.143
- I used to get into
a little bit of trouble.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.520
<i>I ended up at a halfway house.</i>

07:18.564 --> 07:20.480
That's when I took
that blacksmithing class

07:20.524 --> 07:24.526
and just love learning how to
make things and create things.

07:24.570 --> 07:27.654
<i>That really made
all the difference for me.</i>

07:27.698 --> 07:29.823
<i>¶ ¶</i>

07:29.867 --> 07:32.409
- Big old massive chunk of W2.

07:32.453 --> 07:34.536
It's gonna be a real pain
to move it and shape it.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.538
- Jason's got the block steel.

07:36.582 --> 07:38.790
- W2 steel's
a great cutlery steel,

07:38.834 --> 07:42.627
and he's got the advantage
of it just being a block,

07:42.671 --> 07:45.046
but he doesn't have quite
as much steel as the others,

07:45.090 --> 07:47.007
so he's got to be creative
and economical

07:47.050 --> 07:49.634
about how he's using his steel.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.803
<i>- What I was wanting
to do originally</i>

07:51.847 --> 07:54.556
was forge the block out
into a bar

07:54.600 --> 07:57.642
<i>that I was gonna chisel,
make it all one piece,</i>

07:57.686 --> 08:00.937
<i>and the steel just didn't do
what I thought it was gonna do,</i>

08:00.981 --> 08:05.984
<i>so I just had to scrap the idea
and figure something else out.</i>

08:06.028 --> 08:09.613
<i>¶ ¶</i>

08:09.656 --> 08:11.656
<i>- Usually I work with stuff
that already has a profile,</i>

08:11.700 --> 08:13.575
and I'm just moving it around
a little bit,

08:13.619 --> 08:15.660
<i>as opposed
to completely shaping it</i>

08:15.704 --> 08:17.662
<i>with tools like power hammers
and presses</i>

08:17.706 --> 08:19.289
<i>that I've never used before.</i>

08:19.333 --> 08:21.833
- Ritchie's not letting
that steel get hot enough,

08:21.877 --> 08:24.878
and that's why that press
is screaming in pain.

08:24.922 --> 08:27.088
[machine whirring]

08:27.132 --> 08:29.257
- I have a lot of labor
in my family history,

08:29.301 --> 08:31.843
a lot of proud people
in my family who...

08:31.887 --> 08:33.595
<i>Their sweat and blood and tears,</i>

08:33.639 --> 08:36.306
<i>you know,
really put food on the plate.</i>

08:36.350 --> 08:39.851
It means a lot to me to have
a job where I swing my hammer,

08:39.895 --> 08:42.270
<i>where I sweat, where I bleed,
where I get burned,</i>

08:42.314 --> 08:44.022
because it brings me
back to that.

08:44.066 --> 08:46.399
It's sort of a tribute
to what they went through.

08:46.443 --> 08:47.943
Hot!
Hot.

08:47.986 --> 08:48.986
- Two hours!

08:49.029 --> 08:51.655
You have two hours remaining!

08:51.698 --> 08:55.534
<i>¶</i> ¶

08:55.577 --> 08:58.954
<i>- I feel very comfortable.
I'm going slow, steady.</i>

08:58.997 --> 09:01.039
- Jason, cool as a cucumber,

09:01.083 --> 09:04.251
moving very deliberately,
taking his time.

09:04.294 --> 09:06.002
- [sighs]

09:06.046 --> 09:07.837
- I think he's kicked back,
writing song lyrics in his head

09:07.881 --> 09:09.798
while he's waiting
for his steel to heat up.

09:09.841 --> 09:11.841
He's showing ten years'
experience that he has.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.718
- He is.

09:13.762 --> 09:16.346
It's like watching a master
so purposefully work with metal.

09:16.390 --> 09:19.266
[clanging]

09:19.309 --> 09:21.226
<i>- I had to compress this
into a square.</i>

09:21.270 --> 09:24.604
I had to work it where it's
tight and it's somewhat secure.

09:24.648 --> 09:26.940
<i>That'll hopefully reset
some of the problems</i>

09:26.984 --> 09:28.692
<i>that I had before.</i>

09:28.735 --> 09:30.569
- That's just hard work
right there,

09:30.612 --> 09:33.613
twisting molten steel
with a pipe wrench.

09:33.657 --> 09:35.699
- I finally got my billet made,

09:35.742 --> 09:38.076
<i>and I can now start

That's gonna support the tip.

I love the way you've flared it
out and it curves back in,

13:45.408 --> 13:48.034
so it gives a belly
for slashing.

13:48.078 --> 13:50.119

with the shape,

13:50.163 --> 13:52.413

it's really heavy.

13:52.457 --> 13:53.998
There's a lot of extra meat
in there,

13:54.042 --> 13:56.501
and that's fine
for supporting the tip,

13:56.545 --> 13:58.253

13:58.296 --> 14:01.840

15:24.007 --> 15:25.007
Before we move forward,

I think we have to test

a hardened blade or not.

- I'm gonna do a file test.
- Okay, let's see it.

15:37.729 --> 15:40.229
- If a blade
is properly heat-treated,

15:40.273 --> 15:43.483
the file should skate
right off the edge.

instead of a fuller.

19:11.693 --> 19:13.317
- For this round,
I just plan to concentrate

19:13.361 --> 19:17.655
on finishing grinding
and just getting a handle on it,

19:17.699 --> 19:20.241
<i>being sure the thing's
ready to go.</i>

19:20.285 --> 19:22.285
- What's the first thing
that Jason does?

19:22.328 --> 19:24.078
Nothing but straight
to this handle.

19:24.122 --> 19:25.913
- He's doing
what we expect Jason to do.

19:25.957 --> 19:27.582
He's got his chair.
- He's doing his thing.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.125
- He's moving
nice and methodically.

19:29.169 --> 19:31.009
- Blocking everybody else out.

19:31.045 --> 19:34.130
<i>- I was able to take some
of the thickness out of it.</i>

19:34.174 --> 19:36.841
Everything looks good.

19:36.885 --> 19:39.260
Now I want to start
thinking about a handle.

19:39.304 --> 19:41.262
<i>¶ ¶</i>

19:41.306 --> 19:44.557
- I have not seen Jason grab
any material for a guard.

19:44.601 --> 19:47.161
- I would be very,
very surprised

19:47.187 --> 19:49.061
if he put no guard on that.

19:49.105 --> 19:51.314
- I would be very, very upset.

19:51.357 --> 19:54.150
<i>- I'm a little worried that
not having a guard on there</i>

19:54.194 --> 19:57.320
might affect it,
but it wasn't a specification,

19:57.363 --> 20:00.281
<i>so I believe I'll be okay.</i>

20:00.325 --> 20:02.366
- 90 minutes, bladesmiths!

20:02.410 --> 20:05.161
You are halfway
through round two!

20:05.205 --> 20:08.164
<i>- I'm trying to do
a burn-through tang,</i>

20:08.208 --> 20:10.541
and I had picked a piece of wood

20:10.585 --> 20:13.544
<i>that did not like to burn.</i>

20:13.588 --> 20:16.088
- No, he's not gonna burn
through that.

20:16.132 --> 20:19.967
What is he thinking?

20:20.011 --> 20:21.636
Oh, my God.

20:21.679 --> 20:24.013
- This is
a living [bleep] nightmare

20:24.057 --> 20:25.723
<i>for me right now.</i>

20:25.767 --> 20:29.268
- Oh, man, it's barely
even going on right there.

20:29.312 --> 20:32.230
<i>- Not a thing is working for me.</i>

20:32.273 --> 20:33.981
What the [bleep] am I doing?

20:34.025 --> 20:35.441
[bleep] [bleep].

20:35.485 --> 20:38.402
<i>¶ ¶</i>

20:42.116 --> 20:45.076
<i>[rock music]</i>

20:45.119 --> 20:47.536
<i>¶</i> ¶

20:47.580 --> 20:50.122
<i>- I'm trying to do
a burn-through tang,</i>

20:50.166 --> 20:52.208
and I had picked a piece of wood

20:52.252 --> 20:55.044
<i>that did not like to burn.</i>

20:55.088 --> 20:56.879
- No, he's not gonna burn
through that.

20:56.923 --> 21:00.424
What is he thinking?

21:00.468 --> 21:03.177
<i>- Fireproof wood...
I didn't know that was a thing.</i>

21:03.221 --> 21:05.137
I really feel like there
should be a warning label

21:05.181 --> 21:09.392
on that piece of wood
that says "does not burn."

21:09.435 --> 21:11.102
- You can tell by Josh's
hairstyle right now,

21:11.145 --> 21:13.020
he's getting frustrated.

21:13.064 --> 21:15.273
He's going over there looking
for different material to use.

21:15.316 --> 21:17.441
- Good.

21:17.485 --> 21:19.944
<i>- I pick up deer bone.</i>

21:19.988 --> 21:21.821
<i>I know that the hole inside</i>

21:21.864 --> 21:25.658
is probably gonna be pretty
close to what my tang size is.

21:25.702 --> 21:27.451
I can do this.

21:27.495 --> 21:31.414
<i>I pop a hole in the end,
let my tang out the back,</i>

21:31.457 --> 21:34.250
slap my rivet block on...
Good to go.

21:34.294 --> 21:36.419
Jay.
- Yeah, brother?

21:36.462 --> 21:38.671
- I admire your pace, man.

21:38.715 --> 21:41.275
- Oh, if I could move
any faster, I probably would.

21:41.301 --> 21:43.134
<i>¶ ¶</i>

21:43.177 --> 21:47.305
<i>Got my handle epoxied on
and pinned and shaped up.</i>

21:47.348 --> 21:50.099
I'm real happy
with the way it turned out.

21:50.143 --> 21:52.435
- Jason is, you know,
going slow and steady.

21:52.478 --> 21:55.104
His pace hasn't changed
in this whole challenge.

21:55.148 --> 21:57.857
- I saw him smile.
- Ah, you're lying.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.776
- [laughs]
- Take a picture next time.

22:00.820 --> 22:04.447
- Bladesmiths, you have
30 minutes remaining!

22:04.490 --> 22:09.076
Your blades must have a handle
on them after this round.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.870
<i>¶</i> ¶

22:10.913 --> 22:14.540
- At first, I was planning
on making a guard

22:14.584 --> 22:18.669
<i>and doing something
with wood for my handle, but...</i>

22:18.713 --> 22:21.630
I saw some leather over there,
and I'm like,

22:21.674 --> 22:24.216
<i>"Let's just wrap this up."</i>

22:24.260 --> 22:26.052
- I don't think
any of us believe

22:26.095 --> 22:29.180
that a wrapped piece of leather
around a handle is the solution.

22:29.223 --> 22:32.725
At least she is trying
to get something finished

22:32.769 --> 22:34.435
so she can turn it in.

22:34.479 --> 22:37.897
- I made the decision
to just finish somehow,

22:37.940 --> 22:40.691
<i>and I hope I just push through.</i>

22:40.735 --> 22:42.818
<i>¶</i> ¶

22:42.862 --> 22:45.613
- Ten, nine, eight,

22:45.656 --> 22:48.699
seven, six, five,

22:48.743 --> 22:53.162
four, three, two, one.

22:53.206 --> 22:56.123
Bladesmiths, your time is up.
Stop working.

22:56.167 --> 22:58.125
<i>¶</i> ¶

22:58.169 --> 23:01.962
<i>- I'm not the happiest person
with what I put out today.</i>

23:02.006 --> 23:05.216
My blade is more like something
you would find in prison

23:05.259 --> 23:08.844
than any kind of dagger
you might find.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.263
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

23:11.307 --> 23:13.057
- All right, smiths,
what I'm gonna do

23:13.101 --> 23:15.142
is take each of your blades

23:15.186 --> 23:17.436
and thrust them through
the lids of these steel drums

23:17.480 --> 23:18.938
three times.

23:18.981 --> 23:20.701
This is gonna test
the strength of your tip,

23:20.733 --> 23:23.484
your heat treat, and your
overall construction.

23:23.528 --> 23:27.029
Unfortunately, two of the blades
don't have guards on them.

23:27.073 --> 23:30.616
As your hand might have
a tendency to slide down,

23:30.660 --> 23:32.743
I'm gonna be adding blade stops
to the two knives

23:32.787 --> 23:35.204
that don't have guards on them.

23:35.248 --> 23:37.248
<i>Jason, you're up first.</i>

23:37.291 --> 23:39.667
- Let's go.

23:39.710 --> 23:42.461
Please don't break.
Please don't break.

23:42.505 --> 23:50.428
<i>¶ ¶</i>

23:53.099 --> 23:55.599
- Well, Jason, your tip
held up nicely.

23:55.643 --> 23:58.727
Everything stayed
straight and true,

23:58.771 --> 24:00.771
and there's still
an edge on there.

24:00.815 --> 24:02.575
Nicely done.
- Thank you.

24:02.608 --> 24:04.358
<i>¶ ¶</i>

24:04.402 --> 24:06.527
<i>- Josh, you're up now.
You ready to go?</i>

24:06.571 --> 24:08.529
-<i> Let's stab some steel.</i>

24:08.573 --> 24:16.495
<i>¶</i> ¶

24:20.376 --> 24:22.376
- Worked well, Josh.

24:22.420 --> 24:25.212
Stayed together, no rolling.

24:25.256 --> 24:26.797
If it was a little bit thinner,

24:26.841 --> 24:28.924
I think it would have penetrated
a little bit deeper,

24:28.968 --> 24:31.135
I mean, but it went in there
nicely and held together.

24:31.179 --> 24:32.595
<i>¶ ¶</i>

24:32.638 --> 24:35.097
- [laughs]

24:35.141 --> 24:37.516
<i>- Kelly, let's do it.</i>

24:37.560 --> 24:40.644
<i>- I don't really have a handle.
I don't really have a guard.</i>

24:40.688 --> 24:41.812
I'm super tense.

24:41.856 --> 24:49.737
<i>¶ ¶</i>

24:51.365 --> 24:54.617
- All right, Kelly,
it thrusts very well.

24:54.660 --> 24:57.119
I got good penetration on that.

24:57.163 --> 25:01.665
It did lose the very end
of the tip there.

25:01.709 --> 25:04.668
Not the most comfortable knife
I've ever held in my life...

25:04.712 --> 25:06.295
<i>¶</i> ¶

25:06.339 --> 25:08.839
But it did the task.

25:08.883 --> 25:11.842
Nicely done.

25:11.886 --> 25:14.470
Now we're gonna turn it over
to Doug for the sharpness test.

25:14.514 --> 25:17.765
<i>¶</i> ¶

25:17.808 --> 25:19.767
- We asked you to make
a double edge on your blades.

25:19.810 --> 25:21.352
To test each edge,

25:21.395 --> 25:24.522
I will glide it
through a burlap bag.

25:24.565 --> 25:26.649
Jason, you're up first.

25:26.692 --> 25:28.025
- I'm ready.

25:28.069 --> 25:35.991
<i>¶</i> ¶

25:38.746 --> 25:40.538
- It will cut.

25:40.581 --> 25:43.123
Good job.
- Thank you.

25:43.167 --> 25:45.334
- Josh, you're up next.

25:45.378 --> 25:47.378
- I'm more anxious
for the slice test.

25:47.421 --> 25:50.673
<i>I knew that I had
a good thrust shape.</i>

25:50.716 --> 25:53.717
I don't know that
I've gotten it sharp enough.

25:53.761 --> 25:58.973
<i>¶</i> ¶

25:59.016 --> 26:00.724
Oh.

26:00.768 --> 26:03.519
<i>¶</i> ¶

26:03.563 --> 26:05.729
Holy [bleep].

26:05.773 --> 26:08.274
- Well, Josh,
it's got some spots here

26:08.317 --> 26:11.402
that I can run my hand
safely through it.

26:11.445 --> 26:15.281
It doesn't cut as well
as I thought it would.

26:15.324 --> 26:18.075
Kelly, you're up next.

26:18.119 --> 26:20.494
- I almost can't watch.
[chuckles]

26:20.538 --> 26:28.085
<i>¶</i> ¶

26:35.553 --> 26:39.305
- Well, Kelly, the balance of
the blade is a little bit heavy,

26:39.348 --> 26:41.307
but it will cut.

26:41.350 --> 26:43.892
Good job.
- Thanks.

26:43.936 --> 26:46.228
<i>- Kelly's slice is successful...</i>

26:46.272 --> 26:48.147
Really good, clean cut...

26:48.190 --> 26:52.109
And it's the nail
in the coffin for me.

26:52.153 --> 26:58.073
<i>¶</i> ¶

26:58.117 --> 27:00.909
- Bladesmiths,
the judges have deliberated,

27:00.953 --> 27:02.328
and they've come to a decision.

27:02.371 --> 27:05.122
<i>¶</i> ¶

27:05.166 --> 27:08.626
The bladesmith
leaving the Forge is...

27:08.669 --> 27:11.670
<i>¶</i> ¶

27:17.053 --> 27:20.054
<i>[rock music]</i>

27:20.097 --> 27:23.515
- Bladesmiths,
all three of your weapons

27:23.559 --> 27:25.351
have been tested.

27:25.394 --> 27:28.395
The judges have deliberated,
and they've come to a decision.

27:28.439 --> 27:30.314
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

27:30.358 --> 27:34.985
Kelly, your blade
did not make the cut.

27:35.029 --> 27:37.196
- You know, Kelly,
I got to give you credit

27:37.239 --> 27:39.698
for fighting your way through
the challenge and not giving up.

27:39.742 --> 27:41.367
You gave us a weapon
we could test,

27:41.410 --> 27:44.662
but during the steel-drum test,
your tip not only bent,

27:44.705 --> 27:47.039
<i>but broke off at the very end,</i>

27:47.083 --> 27:51.293
<i>and it's not a finished piece
with a leather-wrapped handle.</i>

27:51.337 --> 27:53.712
So these are things
we just couldn't overlook.

27:53.756 --> 27:56.965
- Kelly, please
surrender your weapon.

27:57.009 --> 27:59.343
<i>¶ ¶</i>

27:59.387 --> 28:02.012
<i>- I agree with the judges'
decision to send me home.</i>

28:02.056 --> 28:04.682
I came here to prove,
I guess, that lady smiths

28:04.725 --> 28:08.060
<i>can also compete and contend.</i>

28:08.104 --> 28:09.812
Hopefully it just encourages
other women

28:09.855 --> 28:10.975
to step up to the plate.

28:14.443 --> 28:18.195
<i>¶</i> ¶

28:18.239 --> 28:20.614
- Jason, Josh, congratulations.

28:20.658 --> 28:22.908
You've made it
to the final round.

28:22.952 --> 28:24.872
When you came here,
we asked you to forge a blade

28:24.912 --> 28:28.455
in your signature style,
using our tools and our forges.

28:28.499 --> 28:29.915
Now we're sending you home

28:29.959 --> 28:32.167
to create an iconic blade
from history...

28:32.211 --> 28:37.005
<i>¶</i> ¶

28:37.049 --> 28:38.049
The kukri.

28:38.092 --> 28:40.050
- Hell, yeah.

28:40.094 --> 28:42.594
<i>- The kukri is a blade
issued to Nepalese soldiers</i>

28:42.638 --> 28:44.513
<i>known as the Gurkhas.</i>

28:44.557 --> 28:47.683
<i>During the Anglo-Nepalese War
in the early 19th century,</i>

28:47.727 --> 28:49.977
<i>the kukri became renowned
in the Western world</i>

28:50.020 --> 28:53.063
<i>for its versatility
on the battlefield.</i>

28:53.107 --> 28:56.191
<i>The kukri's unique curved
design and angle of the blade</i>

28:56.235 --> 29:00.863
<i>gives it the ability to slice
and chop simultaneously.</i>

29:00.906 --> 29:03.699
<i>The Gurkha soldiers were said
to be so skilled with the kukri</i>

29:03.743 --> 29:07.202
<i>that it acted as
an extension of their arm.</i>

29:07.246 --> 29:10.205
<i>Today the kukri is
far more visible worldwide,</i>

29:10.249 --> 29:12.875
<i>seen in films like
"Resident Evil: Extinction"</i>

29:12.918 --> 29:15.878
<i>and "Big Trouble
in Little China."</i>

29:15.921 --> 29:17.921
<i>¶ ¶</i>

29:17.965 --> 29:21.300
It must be a fully functioning,
authentic version

29:21.343 --> 29:23.677
of that deadly weapon.

29:23.721 --> 29:27.681
- I'm really nervous because
I know literally nothing

29:27.725 --> 29:30.726
about this blade.

29:30.770 --> 29:33.645
- You will have five days
to complete this challenge.

29:33.689 --> 29:37.107
At the end of five days,
you will return to this forge

29:37.151 --> 29:39.318
and present your kukri
to our judges.

29:39.361 --> 29:41.737
They will put them
through a series of dynamic

29:41.781 --> 29:44.948
and explosive tests.

29:44.992 --> 29:48.243
At the end of that testing,
they will determine which of you

29:48.287 --> 29:50.287
will be
the "Forged in Fire" champion

29:50.331 --> 29:53.499
and leave with a check
for $10,000.

29:53.542 --> 29:55.167
Good luck, bladesmiths.

29:55.211 --> 29:59.296
We'll see you in five days.

29:59.340 --> 30:03.634
<i>¶</i> ¶

30:03.677 --> 30:05.636
- It's day one in my home forge.

30:05.679 --> 30:08.931
There's a lot less equipment
that I have here...

30:08.974 --> 30:11.600
No press, no power hammer.

30:11.644 --> 30:15.312
<i>I'm back to just my usual
way of working things.</i>

30:15.356 --> 30:17.940
It feels great.
I'm confident here.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.942
Let's crank the heat.

30:19.985 --> 30:22.945
<i>My plan is to make this blade</i>

30:22.988 --> 30:27.282
using three different types
of metals...

30:27.326 --> 30:30.536
<i>A wrought-iron spine,
mild steel,</i>

30:30.579 --> 30:33.664
and then finally the edge bar
is going to be carbon steel,

30:33.707 --> 30:38.418
which is going to give it
that sharp cutting power.

30:38.462 --> 30:41.046
<i>The hardest thing
about making this blade</i>

30:41.090 --> 30:43.215
<i>is getting the welds
to stick together.</i>

30:43.259 --> 30:45.050
<i>¶ ¶</i>

30:45.094 --> 30:48.136
<i>When I cut it open,
we'll be able to see what stuck</i>

30:48.180 --> 30:49.805
<i>and what didn't stick.</i>

30:49.849 --> 30:54.101
<i>¶</i> ¶

30:54.144 --> 30:55.602
[bleep].

30:55.646 --> 30:57.855
None of this is usable.

30:57.898 --> 31:00.107
<i>It was too thick</i>

31:00.150 --> 31:03.819
and did not weld together.

31:03.863 --> 31:07.197
And now I will have
to start over.

31:07.241 --> 31:09.992
Scrap pile.

31:10.035 --> 31:13.871
<i>¶ ¶</i>

31:13.914 --> 31:17.165
<i>- Now that I'm back home,
I feel much more at ease.</i>

31:17.209 --> 31:18.917
I'm used to my equipment.

31:18.961 --> 31:22.087
Where my shop varies is
I run a coal forge here.

31:22.131 --> 31:25.173
<i>Coal will heat your steel
a little quicker.</i>

31:25.217 --> 31:28.010
You can get a little more work
done faster.

31:28.053 --> 31:32.180
<i>I've got a wonderful family,
and if I can win this,</i>

31:32.224 --> 31:33.849
it would mean all the support

31:33.893 --> 31:36.518
that my family's given me
over the years is...

31:36.562 --> 31:39.146
Yeah, they've been correct
to do it.

31:39.189 --> 31:43.108
This is a lot larger of a kukri
than I've made before.

31:43.152 --> 31:45.986
<i>So it's gonna be a little bit
more forging and stuff</i>

31:46.030 --> 31:47.946
<i>than what I'm used to.</i>

31:47.990 --> 31:49.990
Yeah, I wish the head
was a little bit wider.

31:50.034 --> 31:51.575
I think it'll be all right.

31:51.619 --> 31:54.536
<i>Got the blade shaped up
the way I wanted.</i>

31:54.580 --> 31:56.663
The blade seems nice
and straight.

31:56.707 --> 31:59.166
<i>I'm leaving it to cool now.</i>

31:59.209 --> 32:02.210
<i>¶</i> ¶

32:02.254 --> 32:03.879
- This is a critical day for me

32:03.923 --> 32:08.050
<i>because I have got to have
a billet to work with.</i>

32:08.093 --> 32:09.885
No billet, no sword.

32:09.929 --> 32:14.848
<i>¶</i> ¶

32:14.892 --> 32:17.059
Whoo!

32:17.102 --> 32:19.937
I am very, very happy.

32:19.980 --> 32:21.396
Me likey.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.357
<i>The mid-bar is welded together.</i>

32:23.400 --> 32:25.859
I've completely come back
from yesterday.

32:25.903 --> 32:27.694
Pretty, pretty, pretty.

32:27.738 --> 32:29.655
So for the rest of the day,

32:29.698 --> 32:32.908
<i>I'm going to start forging
the profile of this blade.</i>

32:32.952 --> 32:36.954
<i>¶</i> ¶

32:36.997 --> 32:38.413
-<i> It's day three.</i>

32:38.457 --> 32:40.916
After doing a little research
on the shape

32:40.960 --> 32:43.335
and overall style of the kukri,

32:43.379 --> 32:46.463
I realized I had formed
the head wrong.

32:46.507 --> 32:48.507
Now I got to reforge the head.

32:48.550 --> 32:56.550
<i>¶</i> ¶

32:56.892 --> 32:59.810
Well, got a problem.

32:59.853 --> 33:04.314
Right up here near the tip,
it's possibly a crack.

33:04.358 --> 33:05.857
If it really is cracked,

33:05.901 --> 33:08.318
it could break off as soon
as I heat-treat it,

33:08.362 --> 33:10.654
or, worst-case scenario,

33:10.698 --> 33:13.699
it could come off
during the testing.

33:13.742 --> 33:16.743
So I'm gonna go ahead
and fix this while I can.

33:16.787 --> 33:18.578
<i>¶</i> ¶

33:22.292 --> 33:23.875
-<i> It's day three.</i>

33:23.919 --> 33:25.585
I'm hammering out
the tip of this blade,

33:25.629 --> 33:27.337
<i>and while
I'm hammering this out,</i>

33:27.381 --> 33:29.923
<i>I just continue to notice
this seam developing,</i>

33:29.967 --> 33:34.177
so I whack it with a hammer,
and sure enough...

33:34.221 --> 33:37.347
Oh, [bleep].

33:37.391 --> 33:40.267
Splits three inches.

33:40.310 --> 33:42.978
<i>Splits six inches.</i>

33:43.022 --> 33:47.691
<i>This thing splits right down
the middle of the blade.</i>

33:47.735 --> 33:49.609
<i>¶</i> ¶

33:49.653 --> 33:51.778
It just rips the bars apart.

33:51.822 --> 33:53.655
This is the first part
of the journey

33:53.699 --> 33:56.825
where I've hit a road
where I blew a bridge up,

33:56.869 --> 34:00.078
<i>and I just don't know
if I can get across.</i>

34:00.122 --> 34:01.955
[bleep].

34:01.999 --> 34:05.459
<i>¶</i> ¶

34:09.048 --> 34:11.965
<i>[rock music]</i>

34:13.552 --> 34:16.928
- It's day four.
Trying to stay positive.

34:16.972 --> 34:19.222
<i>I can still make this happen.</i>

34:19.266 --> 34:21.141
<i>I've salvaged the good stuff.</i>

34:21.185 --> 34:23.769
<i>I've drawn out
a new piece of steel.</i>

34:23.812 --> 34:26.146
I'm forge-welding them
together.

34:26.190 --> 34:29.191
<i>There's a lot of forging
left to be done.</i>

34:29.234 --> 34:33.904
I am doing my damndest
to win this thing.

34:33.947 --> 34:36.073
<i>¶</i> ¶

34:36.116 --> 34:38.867
<i>- The crack's gone.
We're good.</i>

34:38.911 --> 34:43.038
<i>Now I can heat-treat it.</i>

34:43.082 --> 34:46.291
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

34:46.335 --> 34:48.502
Got to be real careful
not to move it,

34:48.545 --> 34:52.089
just let this thing sit still
inside the oil

34:52.132 --> 34:54.508
and completely cool down.

34:54.551 --> 34:58.261
At this point, I hope I got time
to get everything done.

34:58.305 --> 35:01.181
<i>¶</i> ¶

35:01.225 --> 35:05.393
<i>- At this point, I've got to
try to quench this thing.</i>

35:05.437 --> 35:09.272
It's gonna be difficult
to get an even temperature.

35:09.316 --> 35:12.609
<i>The quench
is the most critical part</i>

35:12.653 --> 35:14.444
<i>of the sword build.</i>

35:14.488 --> 35:16.947
All right, who's ready?

35:16.990 --> 35:18.949
<i>This is it.</i>

35:18.992 --> 35:21.118
<i>If this blade doesn't survive
the quench, I'm sunk.</i>

35:21.161 --> 35:22.702
There's just no coming back
from it.

35:22.746 --> 35:25.163
Three...

35:25.207 --> 35:27.415
two...

35:27.459 --> 35:28.959
one.

35:29.002 --> 35:31.962
<i>[rock music]</i>

35:32.005 --> 35:34.464
<i>¶ ¶</i>

35:34.508 --> 35:38.135
<i>I'm finding absolutely nothing
wrong with this blade.</i>

35:38.178 --> 35:41.847
Everything is exactly
as it should be.

35:41.890 --> 35:43.765
I have a blade!

35:43.809 --> 35:45.892
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

35:45.936 --> 35:53.859
<i>¶</i> ¶

35:56.780 --> 35:58.155
- All right.

35:58.198 --> 36:04.995
<i>¶</i> ¶

36:05.038 --> 36:06.788
- That's good.

36:06.832 --> 36:09.875
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

36:09.918 --> 36:11.418
<i>¶ ¶</i>

36:11.461 --> 36:13.879
- Jason, Josh, welcome back.

36:13.922 --> 36:16.423
Many battles Gurkha soldiers
have fought

36:16.466 --> 36:18.550
were defending forts
just like this one,

36:18.594 --> 36:20.635
so we thought it would be
an ideal place

36:20.679 --> 36:22.137
to test your kukris.

36:22.181 --> 36:23.847
You've had five days
at your home forge

36:23.891 --> 36:25.932
to complete your weapons.

36:25.976 --> 36:28.310
Jason, how did it go?
- Went good.

36:28.353 --> 36:30.729
I was really pleased with
the way everything turned out.

36:30.772 --> 36:34.149
<i>Ran into a few issues, but
I feel good about it overall.</i>

36:34.193 --> 36:36.234
- Nice.
Josh, how did it go?

36:36.278 --> 36:38.028
- It was a good time.
It was rough.

36:38.071 --> 36:40.697
<i>I had some trouble spots,
but I pulled through,</i>

36:40.741 --> 36:42.741
<i>and I'm pretty happy
with the piece.</i>

36:42.784 --> 36:45.160
- Gentlemen, your weapons
look fantastic,

36:45.204 --> 36:47.954
but we know looks
are secondary to performance.

36:47.998 --> 36:49.748
We will now put
both your weapons

36:49.791 --> 36:51.541
through a series of tests.

36:51.585 --> 36:53.585
First up, the strength test.

36:53.629 --> 36:55.420
Doug.

36:55.464 --> 36:57.881
- Bladesmiths,
kukris were multipurpose knives,

36:57.925 --> 36:59.633
as well as weapons of war.

36:59.676 --> 37:02.802
It was also used commonly
to clear the fields of Nepal,

37:02.846 --> 37:04.387
as well as chop wood.

37:04.431 --> 37:06.723
To test the strength
of your kukri,

37:06.767 --> 37:09.643
I will cut through
these sugarcanes.

37:09.686 --> 37:12.520
Jason, you're up. Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

37:12.564 --> 37:16.566
I'm getting nervous 'cause
it's all out of my hands now.

37:16.610 --> 37:19.569
<i>[rock music]</i>

37:19.613 --> 37:27.535
<i>¶</i> ¶

37:28.872 --> 37:31.665
- Well, Jason, this is a beast.

37:31.708 --> 37:33.333
- Thank you.

37:33.377 --> 37:36.336
- I do not see any indentations
in your blade at all,

37:36.380 --> 37:38.129
so it cut nicely,

37:38.173 --> 37:41.466
but the handle construction
is very hard to hold on to,

37:41.510 --> 37:42.926
'cause it's very smooth.

37:42.970 --> 37:46.221
But once again, it did its job.

37:46.265 --> 37:48.306
Good job.
- Thank you.

37:48.350 --> 37:51.810
- Josh, you're up. You ready?
- I'm ready.

37:51.853 --> 37:53.520
Is this thing even gonna hold up

37:53.563 --> 37:55.605
and come out in one piece
at the end?

37:55.649 --> 37:58.149
I have no idea.

37:58.193 --> 38:06.116
<i>¶</i> ¶

38:09.663 --> 38:12.038
- Well, Josh, I don't see
any indentations

38:12.082 --> 38:13.581
on your edge over here.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.375
I like the balance.

38:15.419 --> 38:18.086
Your handle is nice and
comfortable around the hand.

38:18.130 --> 38:20.046
I was able to maintain
control of it,

38:20.090 --> 38:24.259
and the edge is sharp enough
to cut through these sugarcanes.

38:24.303 --> 38:25.885
Good job.

38:25.929 --> 38:28.346
<i>- I think coming
out of the sugarcane test,</i>

38:28.390 --> 38:30.890
we're at a tie right now.

38:30.934 --> 38:34.811
- All right, gentlemen,
next up is the kill test.

38:34.855 --> 38:36.980
The kukri is
a powerful weapon in combat,

38:37.024 --> 38:38.732
so much so that in 1814,

38:38.775 --> 38:40.650
22,000 British soldiers went up

38:40.694 --> 38:43.570
against 600 Gurkhas
armed with a kukri.

38:43.613 --> 38:45.573
The British suffered
massive losses,

38:45.615 --> 38:47.657
and the Gurkhas
never surrendered.

38:47.701 --> 38:51.870
Thus began the legend
and reputation of the kukri.

38:51.913 --> 38:54.289
To test the lethality
and function of your blade,

38:54.333 --> 38:55.790
I will take your kukri,

38:55.834 --> 38:59.085
and I will slash through
these carcasses.

38:59.129 --> 39:00.378
Jason, you're up.

39:00.422 --> 39:02.714
- All right, let's go.

39:02.758 --> 39:04.591
<i>My heart's beating.</i>

39:04.634 --> 39:08.511
Anytime you cut bone, it's
very, very hard on a blade.

39:08.555 --> 39:11.097
<i>If you're gonna get a chip
or something in your blade,</i>

39:11.141 --> 39:13.725
<i>it's gonna happen
when you cut through bone.</i>

39:13.769 --> 39:21.691
<i>¶</i> ¶

39:26.365 --> 39:29.491
- Well, Jason...

39:29.534 --> 39:32.285
the beast over here...
It cuts.

39:32.329 --> 39:34.287
Just the way it
sliced through this time,

39:34.331 --> 39:36.331
I felt the nice curve
in your design.

39:36.375 --> 39:39.584
This, sir, will kill.

39:39.628 --> 39:41.252
- Thank you.

39:41.296 --> 39:44.130
- Josh, you're up. You ready?
- Let's do it.

39:44.174 --> 39:46.424
I'm half excited
and half [bleep] my pants.

39:46.468 --> 39:50.053
Is this blade
even worth its salt?

39:50.097 --> 39:52.889
<i>¶ ¶</i>

39:57.062 --> 40:00.063
<i>¶ ¶</i>

40:00.107 --> 40:03.066

40:06.571 --> 40:14.494
<i>¶</i> ¶

40:20.127 --> 40:21.835
<i>Not again!</i>

40:21.878 --> 40:25.088
I mean, this isn't as
devastating as the burlap bag,

40:25.132 --> 40:29.634
but it is by no means how
I want this thing to perform.

40:31.263 --> 40:33.471
- Well, Josh,
your blade didn't slash

40:33.515 --> 40:35.098
all the way through
the carcasses,

40:35.142 --> 40:39.310
but it did cut,
and those kind of cuts...

40:39.354 --> 40:40.937
will kill.

40:40.981 --> 40:43.106
<i>- Leaving the kill test
is not what I wanted,</i>

40:43.150 --> 40:45.150
but I still feel
like I have a chance here.

40:45.193 --> 40:49.112
I am still super happy
about the handling,

40:49.156 --> 40:53.741
super happy about the balance,
the motion, the control.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.994
Those are all fantastic results.

40:56.037 --> 40:59.247
<i>¶</i> ¶

40:59.291 --> 41:04.169
- Jason, Josh, you were given
five days at your home forge

41:04.212 --> 41:07.714
to design and fabricate
signature kukris.

41:07.757 --> 41:11.050
You've both done
a fantastic job.

41:11.094 --> 41:13.219
- Jason, you got
quite a blade there,

41:13.263 --> 41:15.597
<i>but it's really heavy for me.</i>

41:15.640 --> 41:18.266
<i>You did have some cracks that
opened up during the testing</i>

41:18.310 --> 41:21.561
on that handle, but overall,
it held together.

41:21.605 --> 41:23.646
Damascus accents
are a nice touch,

41:23.690 --> 41:26.274
and your blade edge performed.

41:26.318 --> 41:27.775
- Thank you.

41:27.819 --> 41:30.153
- Comments for Josh?

41:30.197 --> 41:32.989
- Josh, that blade
has great balance.

41:33.033 --> 41:35.617
<i>On a strength test, I was able
to cut through the sugarcane.</i>

41:35.660 --> 41:37.243
<i>I could have kept going</i>

41:37.287 --> 41:38.953
<i>with the balance you have
on your blade,</i>

41:38.997 --> 41:40.914
but then the kill test,

41:40.957 --> 41:45.668
the edge retention on that blade
came into question.

41:45.712 --> 41:49.422
- Gentlemen, this was
a very difficult decision,

41:49.466 --> 41:52.926
but there can only be one

41:56.223 --> 41:59.140
Jason, congratulations.

41:59.184 --> 42:01.309
<i>[rock music]</i>

42:01.353 --> 42:04.604
Josh, unfortunately
you did not make the cut.

42:04.648 --> 42:07.106
- Josh, when I saw your blade
in the strength test,

42:07.150 --> 42:08.650
the way it performed,

42:08.693 --> 42:11.694
I expected it to continue
performing that way,

42:11.738 --> 42:13.655
and your edge retention
didn't hold up,

42:13.698 --> 42:16.074
so that's why I have to
let you go.

42:16.117 --> 42:18.868
- Josh, please surrender
your weapon.

42:18.912 --> 42:20.745
-<i> I'm disappointed,</i>

42:20.789 --> 42:25.208
but what I've learned from
this experience is invaluable.

42:25.252 --> 42:28.253
<i>And even though I didn't walk
away with 10 grand today,</i>

42:28.296 --> 42:30.171
I don't feel like a loser,

42:30.215 --> 42:33.258
<i>so that's a really nice relief
at the end of it.</i>

42:33.301 --> 42:34.801
- Jason, congratulations.

42:34.844 --> 42:36.177
You are
the "Forged in Fire" champion,

42:36.221 --> 42:39.222
which comes
with a $10,000 check.

42:39.266 --> 42:40.348
- Yes.

42:40.392 --> 42:42.350
I just won ten grand.

42:42.394 --> 42:45.103
<i>Oh, God Almighty,
I'm so happy right now.</i>

42:45.146 --> 42:46.563
I can barely talk.

42:46.606 --> 42:48.022
- You got a beast there.

42:48.066 --> 42:49.816
That thing...
You get that thing in motion,

42:49.859 --> 42:51.317
that's gonna
keep going and going.

42:51.361 --> 42:53.611
That edge held up great.
- Thank you.

42:53.655 --> 42:55.321
I came here to prove

42:55.365 --> 42:57.949
<i>that I'm doing the right thing
with my life,</i>

42:57.993 --> 43:00.243
<i>and I feel like
I've accomplished all that.</i>

43:00.287 --> 43:03.538
I'll be bragging about this
for a long time to come.

43:03.582 --> 43:09.210
