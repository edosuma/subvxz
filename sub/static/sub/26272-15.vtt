00:23.562 --> 00:25.406
Okay, ladies,
this is the only cover-up

00:25.447 --> 00:27.822
you will ever need.
It is absolutely magical.

00:28.253 --> 00:30.142
And how much
does this magic cost?

00:30.228 --> 00:33.453
Well, if you ask me,
it's priceless, but for you, $29.99.

00:33.539 --> 00:35.384
Renewable every other month.

00:35.985 --> 00:37.751
Ooh, can you hold this?

00:40.164 --> 00:41.779
Ma'am.

00:42.478 --> 00:46.189
Marshals, is there... is there
something I can do for you?

00:46.275 --> 00:47.750
Your daughter home?

00:48.175 --> 00:52.017
No. She's at school. Why?

00:52.111 --> 00:54.189
We're gonna need to swing by
and pick her up.

00:55.719 --> 00:57.114
Can I get my purse?

00:57.208 --> 00:59.863
Just your purse. We'll come back
and close everything up.

01:00.689 --> 01:03.462
Sherri, is everything all right?
I don't know.

01:03.548 --> 01:05.525
- But are you coming back?
- I don't know.

01:05.611 --> 01:07.759
Well, can I still buy this?

01:13.123 --> 01:14.556
Is he here yet?

01:14.642 --> 01:16.337
Not yet. I just...

01:16.423 --> 01:19.665
I need to make you aware
of something.

01:19.790 --> 01:21.587
Unless it has to do
with Walter Franklin,

01:21.665 --> 01:23.033
I don't want to hear about it.

01:23.181 --> 01:24.704
Well, it sort of does.

01:24.872 --> 01:29.142
Uh, Taylor needed to bring
her son with her to work today.

01:29.314 --> 01:30.564
The heat was out

01:30.650 --> 01:31.790
at her day care and...

01:31.876 --> 01:33.642
Walter Franklin is coming.

01:33.728 --> 01:36.134
I know Walter Franklin
is coming. It'll be fine.

01:36.220 --> 01:37.156
Man's of a
certain age,

01:37.241 --> 01:39.728
I'm sure he's met lots
of children in his lifetime.

01:39.836 --> 01:41.290
- Little help?
- Sorry.

01:43.431 --> 01:44.884
Wha...?

01:45.649 --> 01:47.454
- Did I miss him?
- Uh, he's not here yet.

01:47.533 --> 01:49.259
Does, um, anybody
have a Sharpie?

01:49.345 --> 01:52.329
No. We are not having him
sign books.

01:52.453 --> 01:54.345
But-but they're his.
He-he wrote them.

01:54.431 --> 01:57.306
He is not here to entertain us.
He's a client.

01:57.447 --> 01:59.915
And one of the great legal minds
of the late 20th century.

02:00.001 --> 02:03.150
And Bull's hero. Mine, too.

02:03.415 --> 02:04.884
Any idea what he wants?

02:04.985 --> 02:07.040
None.
Just that he wants to meet.

02:07.126 --> 02:08.892
He has a case
he wants me to consider.

02:09.829 --> 02:10.846
I'm jealous.

02:10.931 --> 02:13.720
Mm. I won't lie, it's a bit
like having Babe Ruth

02:13.806 --> 02:15.806
- ask you to pitch to him.
- Mm.

02:15.891 --> 02:18.673
They just called from the lobby.
He's on his way up.

02:29.328 --> 02:31.808
Dr. Jason Bull,
I presume?

02:32.970 --> 02:34.665
Oh, my mistake.

02:34.806 --> 02:36.781
The folks at my firm said
you were younger than I

02:36.867 --> 02:39.259
and better looking.
I went with my gut.

02:39.782 --> 02:41.814
Mr. Franklin, it's an honor.

02:41.971 --> 02:44.470
You remember the
Arrowsure Corporation?

02:44.611 --> 02:47.986
The gigantic Ponzi scheme
that they had

02:48.072 --> 02:50.118
that the feds took down
a few years ago in Chicago?

02:50.259 --> 02:51.837
How could we not?

02:52.072 --> 02:54.406
100,000 people lost
their savings.

02:54.517 --> 02:56.517
The Madoff of the Midwest.

02:56.603 --> 02:58.251
You remember
Anthony Gibson?

02:58.439 --> 03:00.470
The mid-level accountant
that testified against

03:00.556 --> 03:02.361
the upper-level executives
in the trial?

03:02.486 --> 03:04.376
Of course.
Didn't you represent him?

03:04.461 --> 03:07.525
I did.
And now I represent his wife.

03:08.533 --> 03:10.635
As part of Anthony's plea deal,

03:10.751 --> 03:14.259
and in return for testifying
against his bosses,

03:14.564 --> 03:17.478
he and his family were put into
the Witness Protection Program.

03:17.641 --> 03:20.790
Moved from Chicago, Illinois
to Poughkeepsie, New York.

03:21.322 --> 03:23.526
Got a job in the
Highway Department.

03:23.970 --> 03:26.931
Two weeks ago, he was shot and
killed at 1:00 in the afternoon

03:27.017 --> 03:28.736
by a car driving through
his toll booth

03:28.827 --> 03:30.415
on Highway 11.

03:31.009 --> 03:33.720
Mrs. Gibson intends to sue
the U.S. government

03:33.806 --> 03:35.186
for wrongful death.

03:36.039 --> 03:38.126
The U.S. government.
Yeah, I've heard of them.

03:38.259 --> 03:40.712
You sure you don't want to
pick on someone your own size?

03:40.915 --> 03:43.572
Well, that's where you come in.

03:43.813 --> 03:46.150
Mrs. Gibson is a
tough customer.

03:46.283 --> 03:49.509
She's got enough anger for a
dozen lawsuits, and rightly so.

03:49.595 --> 03:52.026
She wants somebody to pay for
what happened to her husband.

03:52.345 --> 03:54.626
But you're worried jurors
might not sympathize

03:54.712 --> 03:55.720
with Ruth Madoff.

03:55.806 --> 03:58.283
Bingo. Guilt by association.

03:58.447 --> 03:59.728
And of course,
the irony is,

03:59.814 --> 04:02.587
he was one of the good guys,
a working stiff,

04:02.787 --> 04:06.845
one of 300 accountants,
just a guy making a living.

04:07.221 --> 04:08.939
But when the government came in

04:09.025 --> 04:12.435
and asked if anyone would
step up and testify against

04:12.521 --> 04:14.400
these ghouls who were
robbing the public blind,

04:14.486 --> 04:16.517
he was the one fellow

04:16.712 --> 04:19.408
who cleared his throat
and said yes.

04:19.930 --> 04:23.501
Felt it was his obligation.
Felt it was his civic duty.

04:23.728 --> 04:26.884
I get it, but I'm not sure
everyone will.

04:27.238 --> 04:28.876
It's not gonna be an easy sell.

04:28.962 --> 04:30.954
People hear you work
for Arrowsure Corp...

04:31.040 --> 04:32.246
I know.

04:32.634 --> 04:34.506
I assume this is
a contingency case?

04:34.591 --> 04:35.978
You really need
the cash up front?

04:36.064 --> 04:37.431
Look at this place.

04:37.517 --> 04:40.814
Looks like somebody went to Best
Buy for dinner and threw up.

04:42.047 --> 04:43.947
Come on, get a look
at this face.

04:44.050 --> 04:46.361
Don't you want to go
into business with this?

04:47.603 --> 04:49.806
Come on. Come with me,

04:50.351 --> 04:52.501
we'll visit the lady
and her daughter.

04:52.934 --> 04:57.329
Do some good with your life.
Earn yourself some good karma.

04:57.892 --> 05:00.259
My husband agreed to testify

05:00.423 --> 05:01.947
because they promised him

05:02.033 --> 05:04.345
that him and his family
would be safe.

05:04.431 --> 05:07.017
The government
made their case

05:07.103 --> 05:09.018
on my husband's back

05:09.104 --> 05:11.719
and then they just basically
left him for dead.

05:11.805 --> 05:13.525
How the hell am I
supposed to know

05:13.611 --> 05:17.353
that my daughter and I are safe
when that could happen?!

05:18.689 --> 05:19.962
You know what?

05:20.056 --> 05:22.314
I just need compensation
from the government

05:22.408 --> 05:24.723
to get me out of this country.
That's it.

05:24.814 --> 05:26.899
Just get me out of this country,
move someplace

05:27.031 --> 05:29.036
where everybody and his uncle
doesn't have a gun,

05:29.121 --> 05:31.126
so that me and my daughter
can start over. That's it.

05:31.211 --> 05:32.947
And that's what I'm here
to try and help you do,

05:33.025 --> 05:36.179
but take my word for it, you go
in there and demand anything

05:36.265 --> 05:37.310
from a jury,

05:37.396 --> 05:39.829
insult the country
they call home,

05:39.915 --> 05:43.000
and they are gonna be only
too happy to exact revenge

05:43.086 --> 05:44.934
on behalf of the friends
and relatives

05:45.020 --> 05:47.931
who lost everything to the
company your husband worked for.

05:48.017 --> 05:50.415
But, you put away that anger,

05:50.618 --> 05:52.970
and you go in
and present yourself

05:53.056 --> 05:55.231
as the victim
you actually are...

05:55.411 --> 05:59.072
The concerned mother,
the grieving widow...

05:59.377 --> 06:02.368
And you might just get
what you want.

06:04.133 --> 06:05.639
Walter, who is this guy?

06:05.725 --> 06:08.295
I... I don't like him.

06:10.973 --> 06:12.837
Give us a minute, will you.

06:23.243 --> 06:24.366
Who's in there?

06:24.452 --> 06:26.632
Daughter. Tiffany. 15.

06:34.650 --> 06:36.676
Tiffany, my name's
Dr. Jason Bull.

06:36.761 --> 06:38.837
I'm part of your mother's
legal team,

06:39.186 --> 06:41.040
at least for the time being.

06:41.995 --> 06:44.050
You think you and I could talk
for a second?

06:44.455 --> 06:46.251
You're not getting in that way.

06:56.920 --> 06:59.100
You have to climb through.

07:12.998 --> 07:15.043
What can I do
for you, sir?

07:15.621 --> 07:18.095
You're not here to take us
someplace else...

07:20.134 --> 07:21.517
are you?

07:22.283 --> 07:24.517
Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.

07:24.603 --> 07:27.251
Sorry I dragged you
out here.

07:27.759 --> 07:29.724
Sorry I wasted
your time.

07:30.345 --> 07:32.076
You talked to the daughter?

07:32.290 --> 07:33.884
Said hello.

07:35.990 --> 07:38.470
If you ask me, we're repping
the wrong plaintiff.

07:38.954 --> 07:41.001
That 15-year-old girl,

07:41.728 --> 07:43.329
she's your case.

07:43.743 --> 07:45.318
Father turns state's evidence

07:45.404 --> 07:47.770
and suddenly she's yanked out of
the middle of the eighth grade

07:47.855 --> 07:49.739
and her life in Chicago
and dropped into a small town

07:49.824 --> 07:52.206
in New York
where she knows no one?

07:52.347 --> 07:54.503
14 months later,
in a single conversation,

07:54.589 --> 07:56.222
she's told
her father's been killed

07:56.308 --> 07:58.737
and she has
to move again to a motel.

07:58.823 --> 08:01.178
Cut off all contact
with everyone she knows

08:01.264 --> 08:02.699
for the second time in her life?

08:02.785 --> 08:05.557
The government that promised her
a safe, new home

08:05.643 --> 08:07.268
in return for her
father's bravery

08:07.354 --> 08:10.807
has delivered only death,
disruption and heartbreak.

08:13.125 --> 08:16.170
And what about Sherri?
What about the mother?

08:16.698 --> 08:17.711
My opinion?

08:17.797 --> 08:20.667
I wouldn't let her within
100 miles of the courthouse.

08:21.977 --> 08:23.776
<font color=#FF00FF>*BULL (2016)*</font>

<font color=#FF00FF>*BULL (2016)*</font>
Episode Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"Security Fraud"</font>

08:28.987 --> 08:30.457
I need a lawyer.

08:30.598 --> 08:32.028
Oh, all right.

08:32.114 --> 08:36.145
Well, I charge by the
quarter hour, starting... now.

08:36.332 --> 08:38.113
I'm doing some legal legwork
for Bull

08:38.198 --> 08:40.020
and this case he's working on
with Walter Franklin.

08:40.105 --> 08:43.169
Yeah, I'm still jealous.
Yeah, and it turns out,

08:43.254 --> 08:45.660
the government claims
there's no negligence.

08:45.801 --> 08:47.439
They say it has
no relationship

08:47.524 --> 08:49.371
to the case for which
Anthony testified

08:49.457 --> 08:51.271
and they're not responsible
if some random person

08:51.356 --> 08:53.418
shoots a witness in WITSEC,
which is...

08:53.504 --> 08:55.941
Appears some fancy new acronym
for Witness Protection.

08:56.027 --> 08:57.035
Think about it,

08:57.121 --> 08:59.762
if someone shoots up
a movie theater

08:59.848 --> 09:02.759
and a witness
in WITSEC is in there,

09:02.973 --> 09:04.137
that's not their fault.

09:04.223 --> 09:08.018
So-so we need to prove that
the killing was in retribution

09:08.126 --> 09:09.551
for Anthony's testimony

09:09.692 --> 09:11.231
and not just
some random shooting.

09:11.434 --> 09:12.895
My bill is in the mail.

09:12.981 --> 09:14.152
My man.

09:14.238 --> 09:17.048
Guys, so I studied
the case files last night,

09:17.134 --> 09:19.793
and whoever was trying
to kill Anthony Gibson

09:19.879 --> 09:21.691
wasn't exactly a great shot.

09:22.137 --> 09:24.079
What do you mean?
He killed the man, didn't he?

09:24.164 --> 09:26.981
But the ballistics report
says the bullet actually missed.

09:27.254 --> 09:29.999
It hit the side of the
tollbooth, then ricocheted.

09:30.115 --> 09:31.659
That's when it pierced
the victim's chest.

09:31.744 --> 09:33.865
I think the net-net
is still the same.

09:33.951 --> 09:36.956
Anthony Gibson is no longer
spending time with his family.

09:37.264 --> 09:39.218
Yeah, well, I'm on my way
to speak with the marshal

09:39.303 --> 09:40.990
who was in charge
of Anthony's protection.

09:41.076 --> 09:42.264
See what he
has to say.

09:42.350 --> 09:44.771
You should probably call
the big guy at the courthouse.

09:45.014 --> 09:47.584
Tell him the government
doesn't think we have a case.

09:49.053 --> 09:51.076
You don't want me
in the courtroom?

09:51.975 --> 09:54.607
I want you to succeed.
I want you to prevail.

09:54.693 --> 09:56.115
I'm telling you
how to do it.

09:56.201 --> 09:58.119
I told you
I don't like this guy.

09:58.204 --> 10:01.559
Well, I do.
He speaks the truth.

10:01.951 --> 10:04.389
You're a great wife,
you're a great mother,

10:04.661 --> 10:06.717
but I'm afraid that you're
a lousy spokesperson

10:06.803 --> 10:08.342
for your own cause.

10:09.920 --> 10:13.514
We're both prepared
to walk away over this.

10:20.990 --> 10:23.678
Honey, do you think
you're capable of this?

10:27.811 --> 10:29.589
What-what do I have to do?

10:29.787 --> 10:33.873
Aside from sitting at the table,
we'll need you to testify.

10:35.498 --> 10:36.633
Come in.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.475
Do you mind?

10:39.826 --> 10:42.990
Chunk? What's so important?
I got to go into court.

10:44.990 --> 10:47.154
I'm not hearing anything
like that on this end.

10:47.240 --> 10:50.318
We just received a motion
to dismiss from the government.

10:50.678 --> 10:52.881
They're claiming
sovereign immunity.

10:53.717 --> 10:55.219
Forget what I said. Got to go.

10:55.304 --> 10:56.739
What's sovereign immunity?

10:56.824 --> 10:58.232
It's a legal principle
that states

10:58.318 --> 11:00.489
you can't sue the government
without its consent.

11:00.779 --> 11:02.439
That doesn't seem very fair.

11:02.600 --> 11:04.140
Yeah. Right. I mean,
I-it seems like people

11:04.225 --> 11:05.427
are suing the government
all the time.

11:05.512 --> 11:07.834
Well, there are loopholes.

11:08.014 --> 11:11.240
We just have to find one
that applies to our case.

11:11.912 --> 11:15.311
That is, if we're going ahead
with our case.

11:20.671 --> 11:23.537
And furthermore, Your Honor,
suing the government

11:23.623 --> 11:26.289
will cause the taxpayers an
unnecessary financial burden.

11:26.374 --> 11:27.811
Your Honor,
may I remind the court

11:27.897 --> 11:30.959
of an exception to sovereign
immunity under the Bivens Act,

11:31.061 --> 11:33.654
which states that a private
citizen may sue the government

11:33.771 --> 11:35.559
when their constitutional rights
have been violated

11:35.644 --> 11:37.100
by the government's own conduct?

11:37.186 --> 11:38.519
In this case,
they violated

11:38.604 --> 11:41.092
Anthony Gibson's
constitutional right to live.

11:41.178 --> 11:44.029
And they did this by not
assigning more security to him

11:44.115 --> 11:46.459
or his family
when he explicitly requested it.

11:46.545 --> 11:47.701
No, no, no, no, no.

11:47.787 --> 11:50.584
The Bivens exception
requires intent,

11:50.754 --> 11:52.811
which means the government
would have had to knowingly

11:52.896 --> 11:54.889
put Anthony Gibson
in the line of fire.

11:54.974 --> 11:56.109
The plaintiff

11:56.194 --> 11:58.589
is arguing negligence,
which implies

11:58.674 --> 12:01.589
benign neglect as opposed to
a willful dereliction of duty.

12:01.674 --> 12:05.379
Therefore,
Bivens does apply in this case.

12:05.701 --> 12:06.729
Mr. Franklin,

12:06.814 --> 12:09.365
I do have to agree
with Ms. Murphy on this one.

12:09.489 --> 12:10.794
Brace for impact.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.106
I'm sensing this
all might be over

12:12.191 --> 12:13.920
before it ever really begins.

12:14.271 --> 12:15.521
Your Honor, I take your point,

12:15.607 --> 12:18.459
and I-I understand
Ms. Murphy's as well.

12:18.545 --> 12:19.609
Uh, but...

12:19.694 --> 12:22.246
I need to call your attention
to the fact that in addition

12:22.332 --> 12:24.771
to violating Anthony Gibson's
constitutional rights,

12:24.857 --> 12:26.569
we are arguing
breach of contract.

12:26.654 --> 12:29.229
And therefore, I need to draw
the court's attention

12:29.314 --> 12:31.399
to the Graves Act of 1812,

12:31.484 --> 12:33.873
which states very clearly
that when the government

12:33.959 --> 12:36.060
enters into a contract
with a private citizen...

12:36.146 --> 12:37.607
The contract
in this case would be

12:37.693 --> 12:39.522
the Witness Protection
agreement... and the government

12:39.607 --> 12:41.600
does not fulfill their end
of the agreement,

12:41.686 --> 12:43.889
then that private citizen
has the right to sue.

12:43.975 --> 12:44.939
By not protecting

12:45.024 --> 12:48.289
Anthony Gibson, the government
is in breach of its contract.

12:48.374 --> 12:49.509
Yes.

12:49.594 --> 12:51.756
The Graves Act of 1812.

12:52.764 --> 12:55.178
I concur with your reasoning,
Mr. Franklin.

12:55.264 --> 12:56.795
And in light of this,

12:56.881 --> 12:58.666
the motion to dismiss is denied.

12:58.752 --> 13:02.006
We will reconvene this afternoon
to select our jury.

13:02.124 --> 13:04.479
I know you're too young
to understand,

13:04.564 --> 13:06.912
but you just witnessed
an amazing piece of lawyering.

13:07.490 --> 13:08.842
Okay.

13:08.978 --> 13:10.463
If you say so.

13:10.626 --> 13:13.584
I got to ask, where'd you pull
the Graves Act of 1812 from?

13:13.670 --> 13:14.732
I've never heard of that.

13:14.818 --> 13:16.868
One of the perks of being
the oldest guy in the room,

13:16.953 --> 13:19.006
- you've lived through more stuff.
- Uh-huh.

13:19.092 --> 13:21.279
Hey, come on. Anybody hungry?
Want to get some lunch?

13:21.364 --> 13:24.019
I-I know a pizza place
on Spring Street,

13:24.104 --> 13:26.499
knock your socks off.
Best pie in the city.

13:26.584 --> 13:27.719
What do you think,
Tiffany?

13:27.804 --> 13:28.943
I'm from Chicago.

13:29.029 --> 13:31.186
I think my socks are staying
right where they are.

13:32.244 --> 13:33.989
So I understand
that you were the marshal

13:34.074 --> 13:36.119
supervising
Anthony Gibson's relocation

13:36.204 --> 13:37.662
and acclimation here
in Poughkeepsie.

13:37.748 --> 13:40.053
Yeah. So what is it
that you need to know?

13:40.320 --> 13:42.251
Well, I'm gathering Anthony
spent a lot of time

13:42.337 --> 13:44.909
in your office
the last few months of his life.

13:45.095 --> 13:46.915
I'd love to know
what you guys talked about,

13:47.079 --> 13:49.181
the nature of his fears
and concerns.

13:49.474 --> 13:51.627
What he might have said
about whoever was following him.

13:51.712 --> 13:53.735
Look, the truth is,

13:53.964 --> 13:56.789
Anthony and I only met
a few times since he got here.

13:57.321 --> 13:58.821
Really?

13:59.274 --> 14:01.319
I was under the impression
that he sat down with you

14:01.404 --> 14:04.509
a couple of times a month,
pleading for more protection.

14:04.820 --> 14:09.210
Again, I think I sat with him
three times total.

14:09.554 --> 14:11.843
And yes, he certainly did
ask for more security.

14:11.929 --> 14:14.093
But in the absence
of a specific threat,

14:14.194 --> 14:16.280
the WITSEC protocol
really discourages it.

14:16.366 --> 14:18.768
- Why is that?
- Because almost all the people

14:18.854 --> 14:21.937
placed in WITSEC get paranoid
their first year in the program.

14:22.210 --> 14:23.509
I mean, they just do.

14:23.827 --> 14:26.689
And I know that sounds pretty
weak given what happened to him.

14:26.827 --> 14:28.079
But I honestly
don't think

14:28.164 --> 14:29.687
it had anything to
do with testifying

14:29.773 --> 14:31.562
against
the Arrowsure Corporation.

14:32.476 --> 14:35.038
You know, there are a
lot of nuts out there.

14:35.124 --> 14:36.843
And every so often,
one of them wakes up

14:36.929 --> 14:38.523
and says to him or herself,

14:38.609 --> 14:40.499
"I just feel like
shooting someone today."

14:40.765 --> 14:42.046
Okay, then.

14:42.257 --> 14:43.468
All the more reason.

14:43.577 --> 14:45.562
Why would you put the guy
in a tollbooth?

14:45.648 --> 14:47.296
In a big glass box?

14:47.452 --> 14:48.700
Because it is our job

14:48.786 --> 14:51.131
to integrate witnesses
into a new community.

14:51.348 --> 14:54.655
To create new identities
for them, not hide them.

14:55.030 --> 14:57.849
We get them jobs at the mall,
the movie theater,

14:57.934 --> 14:59.702
the family restaurant.

15:00.202 --> 15:04.046
The idea is they're hiding
in plain sight.

15:06.334 --> 15:07.819
You talked to the FBI?

15:08.046 --> 15:09.259
No. Should I?

15:09.452 --> 15:10.601
I don't know.

15:10.687 --> 15:12.958
The last time I told him
I couldn't put more manpower

15:13.044 --> 15:16.219
on his account, he told me
he was gonna talk to the FBI.

15:16.702 --> 15:18.452
Just a thought.

15:19.335 --> 15:21.335
He was a hero.
You know?

15:21.445 --> 15:22.789
Your dad?

15:23.538 --> 15:25.304
He didn't have
to do what he did.

15:25.444 --> 15:26.799
He got nothing for it.

15:26.938 --> 15:28.593
In fact, he lost a lot.

15:29.015 --> 15:31.749
He just felt it was
the right thing to do.

15:35.524 --> 15:37.405
Should I change the subject?

15:39.546 --> 15:41.374
No, I just...

15:45.349 --> 15:47.349
I'll be right back.

15:54.273 --> 15:56.015
You want to talk shop?

15:56.218 --> 15:57.624
Good pie, huh?

15:57.765 --> 15:59.680
This is gonna be
a tricky voir dire.

16:00.687 --> 16:02.898
You're the jury whisperer.

16:04.476 --> 16:07.919
So, while you are asking
the questions,

16:08.004 --> 16:09.741
my team will be
back in the office.

16:09.827 --> 16:12.327
They'll be giving me information
in my ear as to whether

16:12.413 --> 16:14.187
or not
we want that juror.

16:14.273 --> 16:17.562
Now, before you accept
or dismiss anybody,

16:17.648 --> 16:19.023
I want you to look at me

16:19.109 --> 16:20.585
and I will give you
the signal

16:20.671 --> 16:22.468
whether we keep
or cut the juror,

16:22.554 --> 16:25.273
and I will nod yes
or shake my head no.

16:25.465 --> 16:29.195
- Mm-hmm?
- "Yes, no." Got it.

16:30.178 --> 16:33.210
So, let me ask you something.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.109
Do you trust the government?

16:35.195 --> 16:36.570
Is that really
the question you gave him?

16:36.655 --> 16:38.365
Seems a bit on the nose.

16:38.451 --> 16:39.773
No. He's freestyling.

16:39.859 --> 16:41.796
But he's Walter
freakin' Franklin.

16:41.882 --> 16:43.887
I got to believe
he knows what he's doing.

16:43.973 --> 16:45.226
I don't know.

16:45.312 --> 16:47.089
Does anyone trust
the government?

16:47.174 --> 16:48.679
Well, it may have been
on the nose,

16:48.765 --> 16:50.140
but it got us
the answer we needed.

16:50.226 --> 16:51.581
How's it looking on your end?

16:51.667 --> 16:53.382
All systems go on my end.

16:54.835 --> 16:57.366
The plaintiff would like to
dismiss this juror, Your Honor.

16:57.452 --> 16:59.312
I-I thought we wanted
that juror.

16:59.398 --> 17:00.835
We did.

17:05.292 --> 17:08.098
I'm confused.
Why did we let that juror go?

17:08.286 --> 17:10.137
She clearly doesn't
trust the government.

17:10.223 --> 17:12.161
She was exactly
what we're looking for.

17:12.247 --> 17:13.777
Oh, I didn't like her.

17:15.195 --> 17:17.419
Relax. There's plenty more
where she came from.

17:17.505 --> 17:20.536
Gentlemen,
it's gonna be a long day.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.247
Good afternoon, sir.

17:23.333 --> 17:24.372
Good afternoon.

17:24.458 --> 17:28.176
So you've been going to this
one restaurant for a long time...

17:28.270 --> 17:30.185
Years... and one day,
you go in there,

17:30.271 --> 17:32.305
you have a delicious meal,
and, uh,

17:32.562 --> 17:35.094
shortly thereafter,
you get food poisoning.

17:35.609 --> 17:37.414
Are you gonna go back
to this restaurant?

17:37.500 --> 17:38.895
No. I don't think so.

17:38.981 --> 17:40.488
This juror owns
a security service

17:40.574 --> 17:42.059
and donates to police unions.

17:42.144 --> 17:44.172
He's the opposite
of the juror we want.

17:44.851 --> 17:46.117
Your Honor,

17:46.203 --> 17:48.428
this juror is acceptable
to the plaintiff.

17:48.514 --> 17:50.254
What is he doing?

17:51.984 --> 17:54.367
Walter, may I speak with
you privately for a moment?

17:54.453 --> 17:55.547
Of course.

17:55.633 --> 17:56.983
Yeah. Tiffany...

17:59.258 --> 18:00.680
So what the hell
happened in there?

18:00.766 --> 18:02.861
Why didn't you look at me
like we talked about?

18:03.367 --> 18:04.967
What do you mean?
What did we talk about?

18:05.183 --> 18:07.148
The signals. You ignored them.

18:07.391 --> 18:09.916
You picked precisely
the wrong jury.

18:10.243 --> 18:12.548
Precisely the wrong jury?

18:12.711 --> 18:14.351
Seriously, Jason?
Come on.

18:14.437 --> 18:16.618
Aren't we being
a little bit dramatic?

18:16.780 --> 18:18.641
I've been doing this
almost half a century.

18:18.750 --> 18:21.047
I think I know
how to pick a jury.

18:21.704 --> 18:23.065
You hungry? Come on.

18:23.151 --> 18:24.985
I know this pizza place
over on Spring Street,

18:25.070 --> 18:26.940
knock your socks off.

18:28.332 --> 18:30.647
Walter, we just had pizza
a few hours ago.

18:30.927 --> 18:33.407
Okay, then, you pick a place.

18:35.804 --> 18:37.484
You know,
I got to talk to someone

18:37.570 --> 18:38.492
back at the office
about something.

18:38.578 --> 18:40.992
Why don't you take Tiffany
and grab dinner without me?

18:43.880 --> 18:45.258
Tiffany.

18:45.789 --> 18:47.738
Sounds like a plan.

18:54.405 --> 18:56.370
Before you make
that call...

18:56.549 --> 18:58.320
Look at me.

18:58.544 --> 18:59.599
I'm looking.

18:59.685 --> 19:01.039
Do I look like a fool?

19:01.125 --> 19:02.336
What are we talking about?

19:02.422 --> 19:04.157
You know what
we're talking about.

19:04.243 --> 19:05.805
There is no Graves Act of 1812.

19:05.891 --> 19:07.383
You and Franklin made it up.

19:07.603 --> 19:09.168
- We did?
- You did.

19:09.301 --> 19:12.216
I'm informing the judge
tomorrow morning, and I expect

19:12.302 --> 19:14.397
that the case will be thrown out
shortly thereafter.

19:14.605 --> 19:16.430
Have a nice evening, Dr. Bull.

19:18.648 --> 19:20.789
Good day today,
I thought.

19:21.334 --> 19:22.654
Oh...

19:28.034 --> 19:30.299
It was as if someone
had lowered a window shade

19:30.417 --> 19:33.260
in front of his eyes and he
couldn't see clearly anymore.

19:36.006 --> 19:40.288
He didn't remember me explaining
how voir dire would work,

19:40.608 --> 19:41.849
didn't remember

19:41.983 --> 19:43.819
taking me to that pizza place.

19:44.139 --> 19:45.929
All of which is sad.

19:46.780 --> 19:48.835
A great mind like that, but...

19:49.468 --> 19:52.679
inventing
the Graves Act of 1812?

19:52.765 --> 19:55.179
I mean, what are you gonna do?

19:55.265 --> 19:56.304
I don't know.

19:56.390 --> 19:57.960
Which do I worry about first?

19:58.046 --> 20:00.851
The man? The case?

20:03.163 --> 20:05.015
I don't even know
who to reach out to.

20:05.101 --> 20:06.257
His family?

20:06.827 --> 20:08.530
Does he even have a family?

20:08.616 --> 20:10.491
I'll get Danny working on that.

20:10.577 --> 20:13.390
But in the meantime, how do you
want to proceed with the case?

20:13.476 --> 20:15.804
As soon as that judge
realizes she's been conned,

20:15.890 --> 20:18.101
she's gonna be
all over you tomorrow.

20:19.091 --> 20:20.958
I need a favor.

20:21.530 --> 20:23.694
I need you to assume
the role of standby counsel

20:23.780 --> 20:26.374
and prepare for this trial
as if it were your own.

20:26.616 --> 20:28.249
You need to be ready

20:28.335 --> 20:32.046
to take over and cover
for Walter at a moment's notice.

20:33.928 --> 20:35.780
I may have found something
that can help us.

20:35.858 --> 20:36.983
A time machine?

20:37.069 --> 20:38.114
Kind of.

20:38.303 --> 20:40.194
I'm taking it back
to the 19th century, though.

20:40.280 --> 20:43.069
Uh, the Tucker Act of 1887.

20:43.360 --> 20:44.858
It has similar principles
to those

20:44.944 --> 20:46.469
that were asserted
in court today.

20:46.660 --> 20:47.787
It's not
an exact match,

20:47.873 --> 20:49.389
but it's close.

20:49.704 --> 20:52.303
You just get Mr. Franklin to
tell the judge that, you know,

20:52.389 --> 20:54.654
he had the right century
but the wrong act.

20:55.107 --> 20:58.795
I assure you, Your Honor, I did
not intend to mislead the court,

20:58.881 --> 21:00.045
I simply misspoke.

21:00.131 --> 21:02.873
And if you will look at
the Tucker Act of 1887,

21:03.045 --> 21:05.819
you will see that virtually
the same principles apply.

21:07.069 --> 21:10.186
For you, Walter, I'm gonna
let this slide.

21:11.537 --> 21:14.717
But just know I'll have my eye
on you for the rest of the trial.

21:15.966 --> 21:17.358
We live to fight
another day.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.444
With one hand tied
behind our back.

21:21.107 --> 21:23.537
See, I told you we had
nothing to worry about.

21:23.623 --> 21:25.148
What, me worry?

21:25.234 --> 21:26.669
Yeah, say what you will.

21:26.794 --> 21:29.444
You don't have as good a
poker face as you think you do.

21:32.451 --> 21:33.826
You ever miss it?

21:33.912 --> 21:36.137
Being part of something
bigger than yourself?

21:36.223 --> 21:37.319
The meager salary,

21:37.405 --> 21:39.225
getting abused daily
on Twitter.

21:39.395 --> 21:41.131
Twitter stuff didn't happen
when I was here.

21:41.217 --> 21:42.217
Oh.

21:42.303 --> 21:44.569
Well, you left
before it got fun.

21:46.045 --> 21:47.803
Story of my life.

21:47.889 --> 21:49.444
So, listen, Agent Stokes,

21:49.530 --> 21:51.341
I, uh, I hear you met
with Anthony Gibson

21:51.427 --> 21:53.006
about a month
before he died.

21:53.521 --> 21:55.536
Can you tell me
what that was about?

21:58.334 --> 21:59.389
What?

21:59.475 --> 22:01.154
Well, it's just, you know,

22:01.501 --> 22:02.842
I would like to
tell you about it,

22:02.928 --> 22:06.553
but, uh, the Bureau's
got its rules.

22:06.639 --> 22:08.490
- You know?
- Hmm.

22:08.874 --> 22:10.873
Well, listen,
agent to agent,

22:10.959 --> 22:12.632
I know I'm putting you
in a tough position.

22:12.717 --> 22:16.067
I just... I need
something to go on.

22:18.901 --> 22:20.772
I need to use the john.

22:23.405 --> 22:25.325
Feel free to show yourself out.

22:36.295 --> 22:39.084
My father absolutely
followed protocol.

22:39.312 --> 22:42.592
He called the marshals
every time he felt threatened.

22:43.003 --> 22:45.123
You know, I-I watched.

22:46.420 --> 22:48.000
I heard him.

22:48.225 --> 22:50.490
And how often would this happen?

22:50.785 --> 22:53.270
In the last couple months
of his life?

22:53.457 --> 22:56.287
Uh... all the time.

22:57.864 --> 23:00.545
And how would you describe your
relationship with your father?

23:00.667 --> 23:02.412
Objection. Relevance.

23:02.498 --> 23:04.303
Your Honor, part
of the reason we're here

23:04.420 --> 23:06.936
is to assess the impact
and to put a value

23:07.022 --> 23:09.084
on the life of a man
who's no longer with us

23:09.342 --> 23:10.557
because of
what we believe

23:10.643 --> 23:13.240
to be gross dereliction
of responsibility by

23:13.326 --> 23:14.928
the United States government.

23:15.259 --> 23:19.123
What could be more relevant,
more valuable to this jury

23:19.669 --> 23:21.256
than to hear the man's daughter

23:21.342 --> 23:23.959
talk about
what her father meant to her?

23:24.465 --> 23:26.092
This guy's really good.

23:26.422 --> 23:28.037
Maybe I overreacted.

23:28.136 --> 23:30.051
Objection overruled.

23:30.363 --> 23:32.154
You may answer the question.

23:37.649 --> 23:39.659
How do I explain this to you?

23:43.078 --> 23:45.003
My father...

23:45.885 --> 23:47.381
was like the sun.

23:47.467 --> 23:48.787
Yeah.

23:48.873 --> 23:51.123
You know,
every day, you got up,

23:51.619 --> 23:53.889
and every day, he was there.

23:55.665 --> 23:57.605
Like, some days were-were cloudy

23:57.691 --> 24:00.740
because he had something on,
on his mind, like a...

24:00.826 --> 24:04.115
a work thing,
or a family thing,

24:04.201 --> 24:05.803
but every day...

24:07.224 --> 24:08.341
he was there.

24:08.427 --> 24:11.920
You know, just peeking through
so you could feel him.

24:12.144 --> 24:14.334
You know,
letting you know that...

24:15.034 --> 24:16.949
you-you could depend on him.

24:17.300 --> 24:18.733
You know, and if you...

24:18.819 --> 24:21.186
if you needed something,
it didn't, it didn't matter

24:21.272 --> 24:23.497
what else
was going on. He...

24:24.159 --> 24:26.483
He would, he would find a way
to get to you.

24:28.163 --> 24:29.903
To-to-to me.

24:31.732 --> 24:33.732
You know, and now...

24:35.131 --> 24:39.975
it's like,
I-I wake up, and...

24:42.261 --> 24:44.261
there is no sun.

24:48.131 --> 24:50.108
No further questions,
Your Honor.

24:53.451 --> 24:55.490
What is that rustling sound?

24:55.987 --> 24:59.172
Is that the sound of you trying
to reach over your own shoulder

24:59.272 --> 25:00.897
to pat yourself
on the back for deciding

25:00.983 --> 25:02.928
to make this case
about the daughter?

25:03.514 --> 25:04.811
Busted.

25:05.967 --> 25:07.319
Ms. Gibson,

25:07.405 --> 25:11.045
you keep insisting that
your father followed protocol.

25:11.387 --> 25:12.576
Well, he did. So,

25:12.662 --> 25:16.053
you're saying
he called the Marshals office

25:16.213 --> 25:17.756
whenever he was supposed to?

25:17.842 --> 25:19.317
Whenever he was worried?

25:19.546 --> 25:20.663
Whenever...

25:20.771 --> 25:23.288
he was contemplating
doing something

25:23.452 --> 25:26.157
that might jeopardize
his new identity,

25:26.302 --> 25:27.697
his family's new
identity?

25:28.124 --> 25:29.460
Yes, of course.

25:29.669 --> 25:32.024
So, did he call the marshals

25:32.109 --> 25:34.064
when he went back to
your hometown of Chicago

25:34.149 --> 25:36.036
- 11 weeks ago?
- Objection, Your Honor.

25:36.122 --> 25:37.567
On what grounds?

25:37.653 --> 25:39.178
Overruled.

25:39.369 --> 25:41.857
Continue, Counselor.
I want to hear this.

25:49.449 --> 25:52.122
I-I was the one
who went to Chicago.

25:54.851 --> 25:56.216
I missed my boyfriend.

25:56.302 --> 25:58.568
I-I-I missed everything.

25:59.396 --> 26:00.575
I took a train.

26:00.665 --> 26:02.540
And when my dad found out,
he got in his car

26:02.626 --> 26:04.638
to try and beat me there
and bring me back, because

26:04.724 --> 26:06.589
he knew that I made a mistake.
Like...

26:06.907 --> 26:09.257
he knew
that I might be in danger.

26:11.086 --> 26:13.193
He wasn't...
He...

26:13.693 --> 26:16.271
He was trying to protect me.

26:16.357 --> 26:19.362
He wasn't trying to hide
anything from the marshals.

26:20.193 --> 26:21.289
I mean...

26:23.074 --> 26:25.423
He was,
but it wasn't about him.

26:25.509 --> 26:27.034
It was about-about me.

26:27.119 --> 26:29.194
He-he didn't want me to get
in trouble with the government.

26:29.279 --> 26:30.302
So,

26:30.388 --> 26:34.161
your father did drive
to Chicago?

26:35.197 --> 26:36.528
Yes.

26:39.438 --> 26:43.018
So if we're talking
breach of contract here,

26:43.104 --> 26:45.513
is there any bigger breach
of contract

26:45.669 --> 26:48.622
than someone in WITSEC going
back to their former life?

26:48.806 --> 26:51.461
Objection, Your Honor.
Counsel is testifying.

26:51.547 --> 26:54.677
Sustained. Jury will disregard.

26:54.989 --> 26:56.521
Oh, Bull.

26:57.403 --> 26:59.552
Things are starting
to go the other way.

26:59.641 --> 27:01.171
Let's be honest.

27:03.111 --> 27:06.278
The marshals didn't put
your father's life in danger,

27:06.459 --> 27:08.159
did they?

27:09.292 --> 27:11.528
You did. Objection!
Your Honor.

27:11.614 --> 27:12.789
Sustained.

27:13.263 --> 27:15.034
Jury will disregard.

27:15.653 --> 27:17.005
No, they won't.

27:17.091 --> 27:18.333
Withdrawn.

27:19.261 --> 27:21.364
No further questions,
Your Honor.

27:30.553 --> 27:33.977
How could she have not told us
about that trip to Chicago?

27:34.110 --> 27:35.641
I know she's a kid,
but still.

27:35.727 --> 27:38.453
She never even told her
mother. She's ashamed.

27:39.444 --> 27:40.914
It's written all over her face.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.425
She made a horrible mistake.

27:42.510 --> 27:45.055
Now she's convinced herself
that's the reason,

27:45.141 --> 27:47.461
she's the reason
her father's dead.

27:48.821 --> 27:53.696
I know it didn't go exactly the
way we wanted today, but still,

27:54.585 --> 27:56.281
you were mighty impressive
in court.

27:56.367 --> 27:57.345
Hear, hear.

27:57.430 --> 28:00.594
Yeah. That and a bus token
will get us on a bus.

28:01.179 --> 28:03.524
Important thing is
that we prevail.

28:04.516 --> 28:07.516
Hey, I'm hungry. You guys want
to get some pizza? Huh?

28:07.602 --> 28:09.306
I know this pizza place
over on Spring Street,

28:09.391 --> 28:10.481
knock your
socks off.

28:10.567 --> 28:12.567
Best pie
in the city.

28:15.410 --> 28:17.314
We have to find a way to prove
that Anthony's killing

28:17.399 --> 28:19.234
had nothing to do
with that trip to Chicago.

28:19.320 --> 28:22.633
We have to find a way to lay
this back at the marshals' feet.

28:22.719 --> 28:24.335
Danny, that's your cue.

28:24.625 --> 28:26.172
So, remember I told you

28:26.258 --> 28:28.352
how when I interviewed
the FBI agent

28:28.438 --> 28:29.586
that Anthony was talking to,

28:29.672 --> 28:31.758
he practically
handed me his file

28:31.844 --> 28:33.281
on a guy named
"Ted Morris"?

28:33.367 --> 28:34.484
Turns out Ted Morris was

28:34.570 --> 28:36.984
the pension fund administrator
for the Contractors Union.

28:37.141 --> 28:38.475
And as it happened,
he invested

28:38.560 --> 28:42.601
the entire pension fund
in the Arrowsure Corporation.

28:42.687 --> 28:46.969
For which he apparently received
some very sizable kickbacks.

28:47.921 --> 28:49.406
Okay.

28:49.515 --> 28:51.640
How did Anthony figure
into all this?

28:51.726 --> 28:54.289
Well, as an accountant
at Arrowsure Corporation,

28:54.374 --> 28:57.639
the Contractors Union pension
account fell under his purview.

28:57.724 --> 29:02.469
Wait. You mean Anthony Gibson
was in charge of these accounts?

29:02.554 --> 29:04.773
Mm-hmm, and it turns out
that the FBI was in the process

29:04.859 --> 29:07.030
of building a case
against Ted Morris,

29:07.116 --> 29:09.734
and I'm guessing
they wanted Anthony to testify.

29:09.835 --> 29:12.195
Jackpot.
So if you're Ted Morris,

29:12.281 --> 29:14.906
and you know the government
has access to the only guy

29:14.992 --> 29:16.917
who can prove
you weren't acting

29:17.005 --> 29:20.093
in your union's best interest
when you invested their funds,

29:20.257 --> 29:23.529
you'd be only too happy to see
that man meet an untimely end.

29:24.051 --> 29:25.836
Now we're getting somewhere.

29:26.116 --> 29:27.946
What do you think, Walter?

29:35.770 --> 29:36.968
Should we wake him?

29:37.054 --> 29:40.156
No. No, you guys can head out
as soon as you're done.

29:40.242 --> 29:42.461
I'll... I'll get him home.

29:46.353 --> 29:47.867
How long was I asleep?

29:49.011 --> 29:50.706
I don't know.

29:50.792 --> 29:54.234
Hour and a half,
two hours.

29:56.943 --> 29:59.257
I'm starting
to make you nervous, aren't I?

30:00.827 --> 30:04.362
I know you're upset with me
about jury selection, and...

30:05.718 --> 30:08.859
I know you're starting to
wonder if I can pull my weight

30:08.945 --> 30:11.648
when it comes time
to call witnesses,

30:11.749 --> 30:13.351
elicit testimony,

30:13.794 --> 30:17.124
cross-examine,
all that sort of thing.

30:17.695 --> 30:19.419
But I assure you,

30:19.504 --> 30:21.629
there is nobody better
on their feet than me.

30:21.714 --> 30:23.984
Nobody.

30:27.426 --> 30:28.971
Walter...

30:31.041 --> 30:32.859
you are my hero.

30:33.994 --> 30:34.869
But the simple truth is,

30:34.954 --> 30:37.039
we already started
calling witnesses,

30:37.329 --> 30:39.236
eliciting testimony.

30:40.626 --> 30:41.767
All of it.

30:42.016 --> 30:43.955
And you did it.

30:44.721 --> 30:46.330
You were masterful.

30:47.837 --> 30:49.814
But the fact that you don't
remember doing it...

30:49.900 --> 30:51.314
Oh, I remember it.
I remember!

30:51.400 --> 30:53.570
I do... now.

30:55.714 --> 30:57.159
Walter.

31:00.886 --> 31:03.589
I need Benny to take the lead
tomorrow in court.

31:04.769 --> 31:06.558
I'm sorry,
but that little girl's future,

31:06.644 --> 31:07.925
that family's future...

31:08.183 --> 31:10.980
It depends
on us getting this right.

31:17.128 --> 31:18.649
You okay?

31:18.847 --> 31:20.300
I'm fine.

31:22.191 --> 31:23.573
You got a cigarette?

31:23.719 --> 31:25.589
No, I don't smoke.

31:26.120 --> 31:27.503
Do you?

31:28.550 --> 31:31.550
I don't know. It depends
on what year this is.

31:33.295 --> 31:35.335
Damn! I hate getting old!

31:44.674 --> 31:46.261
This is you.

31:47.097 --> 31:48.542
I know.

31:52.081 --> 31:53.761
I'm sorry.

31:54.594 --> 31:56.573
You have nothing
to be sorry for.

32:01.954 --> 32:03.628
See you in the morning.

32:05.940 --> 32:07.583
I'll see you in the morning.

32:10.239 --> 32:12.745
Don't go yet.
I want to make sure he gets inside.

32:19.583 --> 32:20.865
Okay.

32:27.382 --> 32:29.472
Dr. Bull?
Hey.

32:30.290 --> 32:31.704
Glad I caught you.

32:32.407 --> 32:33.439
What's so urgent?

32:33.525 --> 32:34.970
The ballistics results
just came back

32:35.063 --> 32:36.423
on the bullet
that killed Anthony Gibson.

32:36.509 --> 32:37.509
And?

32:37.595 --> 32:39.916
And it matches bullets
used in a gang shooting

32:40.360 --> 32:42.438
in Chicago just over a year ago.

32:42.672 --> 32:43.778
I don't understand.

32:43.863 --> 32:45.128
Well, that gun was
never recovered.

32:45.213 --> 32:47.579
And it appears to have been used
in this killing.

32:48.532 --> 32:49.736
And the defense
is gonna use that

32:49.821 --> 32:51.954
to tie Anthony's trip
to Chicago to his death.

32:52.094 --> 32:54.985
Anthony drove to Chicago,
somebody saw him in Chicago,

32:55.071 --> 32:56.743
the gun came from Chicago.

32:58.143 --> 32:59.524
If Anthony had played
by the rules,

32:59.610 --> 33:01.188
he'd still be alive today.

33:02.422 --> 33:04.477
Everybody's off the hook.

33:05.563 --> 33:08.789
The defense calls
Gerald Montgomery to the stand.

33:09.313 --> 33:12.344
Please, state your relationship
to the Gibson family.

33:12.469 --> 33:14.028
We, uh, lived down
the block from them.

33:14.113 --> 33:16.688
My, uh, son Brian and
the Gibsons' daughter Tiffany

33:16.774 --> 33:18.180
dated for about five months.

33:18.266 --> 33:19.383
And when was
the last time

33:19.469 --> 33:21.368
your son and Tiffany
saw each other?

33:21.680 --> 33:23.258
Apparently, 11 weeks ago.

33:23.648 --> 33:24.957
What do you mean, "apparently"?

33:25.043 --> 33:26.508
Well, I was
told that, uh,

33:26.594 --> 33:27.778
Tiffany snuck into our home,

33:27.863 --> 33:29.360
though truthfully,
I-I never saw her.

33:29.446 --> 33:31.454
Objection. Hearsay.

33:31.629 --> 33:34.149
Sustained. Jury will disregard.

33:34.477 --> 33:36.047
So when was it

33:36.133 --> 33:38.422
that you heard
about Tiffany's visit?

33:38.563 --> 33:41.133
When I opened my front door
and I saw her father,

33:41.219 --> 33:43.039
Anthony Gibson, standing there.

33:43.725 --> 33:44.860
Mr. Gibson was

33:44.946 --> 33:47.563
at your front door
in suburban Chicago?

33:47.649 --> 33:48.368
He certainly was.

33:48.453 --> 33:50.203
And were you surprised
to see him?

33:50.297 --> 33:52.986
Stunned.
And I told him so, loudly.

33:53.187 --> 33:55.562
What do you mean?
What-what exactly did you say?

33:57.226 --> 33:59.427
I told him I thought he was
a reprehensible human being.

33:59.538 --> 34:00.858
I told him
that I had personally lost

34:00.943 --> 34:02.710
almost all my money
on Arrowsure

34:02.796 --> 34:05.460
and their
Ponzi nonsense,

34:05.687 --> 34:08.304
and now I was gonna have
to start all over from nothing,

34:08.687 --> 34:11.514
after working my entire life
to get to where I was.

34:11.748 --> 34:13.567
And how did he react?

34:14.530 --> 34:16.655
Well, he didn't,
he-he just kept asking me

34:16.741 --> 34:17.835
if I knew where
his daughter was.

34:17.920 --> 34:19.045
And did you?

34:19.248 --> 34:21.877
At that point, no,
but even if I had,

34:21.963 --> 34:23.618
I don't think
I would have told him.

34:24.023 --> 34:25.757
I was so angry.

34:26.241 --> 34:27.391
I mean, to me, he got off light.

34:27.476 --> 34:29.710
I... He got to live his life,

34:29.795 --> 34:32.197
he got to go into the Witness
Protection Program, and...

34:32.304 --> 34:35.585
and meanwhile, like, a...
a quarter of his neighborhood

34:35.702 --> 34:37.638
was flat on its ass.

34:37.817 --> 34:41.109
You know, no savings,
no retirement.

34:41.195 --> 34:42.266
No nothing.

34:42.353 --> 34:44.070
The neighborhood
where you were publicly having

34:44.156 --> 34:46.319
this loud conversation
with Anthony Gibson?

34:46.513 --> 34:48.179
Yes. On my stoop.

34:48.733 --> 34:50.518
And I'm sure
the whole damn block heard.

34:50.655 --> 34:53.217
And couldn't any of these
neighbors have followed.

34:53.303 --> 34:55.304
Mr. Gibson back
to Poughkeepsie that night?

34:55.422 --> 34:57.632
Objection. Your Honor,
please.

34:57.725 --> 34:59.291
This is pure speculation.

34:59.377 --> 35:00.618
Sustained.

35:00.744 --> 35:02.658
Jury will ignore the question.

35:02.916 --> 35:04.955
We will reconvene
this afternoon.

35:06.143 --> 35:07.278
The only problem is,

35:07.363 --> 35:08.854
our jurors just don't
have anywhere to put

35:08.939 --> 35:10.634
their empathy for Tiffany.

35:10.813 --> 35:12.738
Her father broke the rules.

35:12.824 --> 35:14.534
And they believe
that's the reason he's dead,

35:14.619 --> 35:16.923
not because of some failure
on the marshals' part.

35:17.503 --> 35:19.673
It really is as simple as that,
isn't it?

35:19.792 --> 35:21.290
I'm afraid so.

35:21.580 --> 35:24.790
So here's a weird one. I just
got back from FBI headquarters.

35:24.876 --> 35:26.362
I wanted to look into
the gang shooting

35:26.447 --> 35:28.736
where ballistics matched
the bullet that killed Anthony,

35:28.946 --> 35:31.626
and guess who was the lead agent
on that case?

35:31.978 --> 35:34.128
Remember the FBI agent
I visited?

35:34.368 --> 35:36.018
Timothy Stokes.

35:36.869 --> 35:39.345
The same Timothy Stokes
who was meeting with Anthony?

35:39.431 --> 35:41.656
The one and only.
And according to the case file,

35:41.780 --> 35:43.655
the gun wasrecovered
in the shooting,

35:43.841 --> 35:47.146
which makes me think that Stokes
held onto it for a rainy day.

35:47.509 --> 35:49.704
So you think Stokes
was an inside man

35:49.790 --> 35:51.204
working for Ted Morris?

35:51.332 --> 35:54.009
I think he's shady all right,
but if anything,

35:54.095 --> 35:56.626
Stokes has a reputation
for being too aggressive

35:56.712 --> 35:58.595
in making his cases,
not throwing them away.

35:58.681 --> 36:01.108
He's got about a dozen
complaints filed against him

36:01.193 --> 36:02.954
for bullying
potential witnesses,

36:03.103 --> 36:05.954
trying to force them to testify,
trying to get them to testify

36:06.040 --> 36:08.010
to things that they're not even
completely comfortable with.

36:08.095 --> 36:10.079
And we know Stokes
was meeting with Anthony

36:10.172 --> 36:11.736
about the Contractors Union
case,

36:11.822 --> 36:14.001
trying to get him to testify

36:14.272 --> 36:16.814
to what he knew about
their accounts and kickbacks.

36:16.900 --> 36:18.845
And a case that could
single-handedly

36:18.993 --> 36:20.689
make this man's career.

36:21.521 --> 36:23.829
Which is why this whole thing
doesn't make any sense.

36:23.915 --> 36:26.619
I mean, why would Stokes want
to have his key witness shot?

36:26.763 --> 36:28.962
A dead witness can't testify.

36:29.414 --> 36:33.877
Crazy thought: you say that
the ballistics report indicated

36:33.963 --> 36:35.928
that the bullet ricocheted
in the tollbooth

36:36.013 --> 36:37.228
before it hit Anthony?

36:37.500 --> 36:38.806
Yeah.

36:39.744 --> 36:41.888
What if he wasn't trying
to kill him at all?

36:41.973 --> 36:43.939
What if he was just trying
to scare him?

36:44.165 --> 36:45.275
Your Honor,

36:45.361 --> 36:48.027
the plaintiff would like
to call a rebuttal witness,

36:48.113 --> 36:49.220
we would like to call.

36:49.306 --> 36:50.921
Agent Timothy Stokes.

36:51.007 --> 36:52.525
Your Honor, this is the first

36:52.611 --> 36:54.208
the defense is hearing
of this witness.

36:54.293 --> 36:56.259
My apologies,
Your Honor, we just

36:56.345 --> 36:59.736
recently learned that Mr. Stokes
had relevant information.

37:00.253 --> 37:02.168
Relevant information, huh?

37:02.978 --> 37:05.408
Well, I guess
we'll all find out together.

37:09.263 --> 37:11.986
You know this
is your witness, don't you?

37:13.094 --> 37:14.720
I'm not sure that's
such a good idea.

37:14.812 --> 37:18.384
Well, your theory,
your witness.

37:18.663 --> 37:21.018
I'm not sacrificing
my guy over some nonsense

37:21.103 --> 37:23.368
you pulled out of your backside
at the last minute.

37:23.751 --> 37:27.158
How do I know this isn't
another Graves Act of 1812?

37:27.382 --> 37:29.619
Your theory, your witness.

37:34.689 --> 37:35.728
Agent Stokes,

37:35.813 --> 37:37.923
thank you for rushing in here
at the last minute.

37:38.222 --> 37:39.317
Not a problem.

37:39.572 --> 37:41.642
Now, you had
a series of meetings

37:41.751 --> 37:44.329
with my client's father,
Anthony Gibson,

37:44.603 --> 37:46.298
in the month before he died,
didn't you?

37:46.383 --> 37:47.478
I did.

37:47.869 --> 37:49.415
You, in fact,

37:49.580 --> 37:52.603
wanted him to testify
against the Contractors Union

37:52.704 --> 37:54.103
in a case you were
investigating.

37:54.189 --> 37:55.754
- Is that correct?
- That is correct.

37:55.897 --> 37:58.806
You wanted him to be your key
witness, in fact, didn't you?

37:59.180 --> 38:01.103
Well, I wanted him
to be awitness.

38:01.189 --> 38:03.509
But yes, I wanted his testimony.
Yes.

38:03.665 --> 38:05.928
But he didn't want
to testify, did he?

38:06.408 --> 38:08.665
He was weighing
his options.

38:08.984 --> 38:10.267
What do you think?

38:10.426 --> 38:12.244
I think he's Walter
freakin' Franklin.

38:12.330 --> 38:15.814
And if anybody deserves
his day in court, it's him.

38:15.900 --> 38:19.345
And you were helping him to
weigh his options, weren't you?

38:19.503 --> 38:20.626
That's my job.

38:20.798 --> 38:22.273
And how do you do that?

38:22.908 --> 38:24.533
Have a conversation.

38:24.970 --> 38:28.119
Try to convince the other party
that they have a civic duty

38:28.205 --> 38:29.462
to share what
they know.

38:29.612 --> 38:30.978
Having a conversation.

38:31.123 --> 38:33.428
Sounds so civilized.

38:33.693 --> 38:34.788
Well, it is.

38:34.873 --> 38:36.845
If you say so,
Agent Stokes,

38:37.212 --> 38:41.314
because I'm looking at a copy
of your personnel file,

38:41.400 --> 38:43.986
and according to this,
you've been disciplined

38:44.087 --> 38:48.525
for bullying witnesses four
times in the last ten years.

38:50.790 --> 38:53.064
You spend a long enough time
in law enforcement,

38:53.150 --> 38:54.455
you're gonna upset people.

38:54.803 --> 38:56.876
If there had been
any truth to those charges,

38:56.962 --> 38:59.182
I would've been dismissed
from the Bureau a long time ago.

38:59.267 --> 39:01.767
Okay, I hear that.
But what possible reason

39:01.853 --> 39:04.884
would people have for filing
false complaints against you?

39:05.203 --> 39:07.884
You were the one who was
following Anthony Gibson

39:07.970 --> 39:09.298
in the months leading up
to his death,

39:09.383 --> 39:10.648
weren't you, Agent Stokes?

39:10.733 --> 39:12.348
You were trying
to intimidate him.

39:12.433 --> 39:13.697
Objection.

39:13.820 --> 39:14.782
Badgering.

39:14.868 --> 39:16.837
Sustained.
The jury will disregard.

39:16.923 --> 39:18.697
Mr. Franklin's
last statement.

39:19.645 --> 39:21.430
Tread lightly, Counselor.

39:21.626 --> 39:22.681
Have no fear, Your Honor,

39:22.784 --> 39:24.389
my feet will never
touch the ground.

39:24.520 --> 39:26.462
Now, how often
did you say

39:26.573 --> 39:28.259
you sought out Mr. Gibson?

39:28.384 --> 39:30.122
I don't know if I ever put
a number to it.

39:30.208 --> 39:31.528
Maybe two or three times.

39:31.614 --> 39:32.841
Two or three?

39:33.193 --> 39:35.106
I would like
to enter into evidence

39:35.200 --> 39:36.408
these cell phone records

39:36.493 --> 39:38.770
derived from multiple
Poughkeepsie cell phone towers.

39:39.062 --> 39:43.169
And here you will find proof of
exactly how often Agent Stokes,

39:43.255 --> 39:45.300
an agent who is based
in New York City,

39:45.386 --> 39:47.871
some 70 miles away,
wasin Poughkeepsie,

39:47.957 --> 39:50.997
stalking his prey,
his cell phone pinging away.

39:52.333 --> 39:53.645
So entered.

39:53.754 --> 39:57.567
17 days, by the way, 17 days,

39:57.653 --> 39:58.872
and, most interestingly,

39:58.958 --> 40:01.396
you'll find that Agent
Stokes's phone pinged

40:01.482 --> 40:03.239
against the tower
on five dates

40:03.331 --> 40:06.505
when Anthony Gibson
called in complaints

40:06.630 --> 40:08.856
to the Marshals office
about being followed...

40:08.942 --> 40:12.192
October 5, October 6,
October 10, October 15,

40:12.285 --> 40:13.381
- October 17...
- That doesn't

40:13.466 --> 40:14.700
prove anything.

40:14.851 --> 40:16.766
I have business
all over this region.

40:17.086 --> 40:18.451
Just because I might
have passed through.

40:18.536 --> 40:19.538
- Poughkeepsie...
- Oh, well, did you

40:19.623 --> 40:22.067
pass through Poughkeepsie
on the day Anthony Gibson died?

40:22.153 --> 40:25.457
Because your phone pinged
in Poughkeepsie that day, too.

40:25.543 --> 40:26.723
Right off the tower

40:26.809 --> 40:28.423
by the tollbooths.

40:30.721 --> 40:31.728
Could it be

40:31.814 --> 40:34.204
because you had something to do
with Anthony Gibson's death?

40:35.603 --> 40:37.558
No. Of course not.

40:37.950 --> 40:39.942
Why would I want to kill
my own witness?

40:40.028 --> 40:42.254
A guy who I wanted
to testify for me.

40:42.387 --> 40:43.825
Of course.
Makes no sense.

40:43.911 --> 40:44.916
Here it comes.

40:45.002 --> 40:46.809
You're a trained FBI agent.

40:46.963 --> 40:48.746
It's a
three-foot-by-three-foot box.

40:48.856 --> 40:50.801
You could have hit him
directly between the eyes

40:50.887 --> 40:52.536
- if you wanted to.
- Exactly.

40:53.093 --> 40:55.207
Too bad the bullet ricocheted

40:55.293 --> 40:57.383
and you accidentally killed him.

40:59.298 --> 41:00.692
Nice.

41:00.830 --> 41:02.140
Smooth.

41:04.168 --> 41:07.173
Poor guy. Doesn't
even know what hit him.

41:07.259 --> 41:10.519
I get the feeling this Walter
fellow has done this before.

41:20.997 --> 41:23.962
Walter, at the risk
of sounding like a sycophant,

41:24.562 --> 41:26.684
it was an honor
to watch you work.

41:27.109 --> 41:28.244
Tell me more.

41:28.743 --> 41:29.856
Well,

41:29.980 --> 41:33.020
this will be forever in
my memory banks, Mr. Franklin.

41:34.156 --> 41:35.246
Well, in all seriousness,

41:35.358 --> 41:37.453
I've had my good moments
and my bad moments.

41:37.539 --> 41:39.348
I think we all know...

41:40.496 --> 41:41.606
I think it's...

41:41.692 --> 41:43.590
time
for me to hang it up.

41:45.964 --> 41:47.621
But I want to
thank you both

41:47.707 --> 41:50.496
for keeping me from embarrassing
myself on the way out.

41:50.902 --> 41:52.817
