00:48.465 --> 00:50.842
David, are you in bed yet?

00:53.721 --> 00:55.471
Yeah, I am.

00:55.556 --> 00:58.349
Okay. Good night.
I love you.

00:58.434 --> 01:00.143
I love you, too.

02:58.428 --> 03:00.429
We'll have
more news here at your

03:00.514 --> 03:02.223
all memories,
all music station

03:02.307 --> 03:05.309
for St. Petersburg and Tampa
at the top of the hour.

03:05.394 --> 03:07.478
Right now I'd like
to send out congratulations

03:07.563 --> 03:09.355
to Thelma Miller
of Orient Park.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.190
She was our
eighth caller yesterday

03:11.275 --> 03:15.778
and collected $225 on our
big money memories jackpot.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.780
Today, it could be you.

03:18.574 --> 03:19.574
Oh, my.

03:19.658 --> 03:21.492
My goodness.
Look at this.

03:21.577 --> 03:24.245
Here you go, Alma.
Your little cart.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.706
What a mess.
That'll do it.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.583
Saltines.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.419
And saltines.

03:31.503 --> 03:34.297
Ex-Lax. You got my Ex-Lax.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.718
Here you go, Bernie.
Hope you feel better.

03:38.802 --> 03:41.012
Don't use that stuff.
Use prunes.

03:41.096 --> 03:42.305
I use both.

03:45.475 --> 03:48.394
Rose, I think these
must belong to you.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.897
Thank you. I'm Rose.
Rose Lefkowitz.

03:50.981 --> 03:52.231
I don't believe we've met.

03:52.316 --> 03:53.941
This is Ben, Rose.

03:54.026 --> 03:55.234
How do you do?

03:57.446 --> 04:00.448
She remembers who I am, she remembers
who she is, so we're doing okay.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.158
Come on, Rose.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.368
That's it.

04:05.203 --> 04:08.164
Poor Rose.
She's really slipping.

04:10.042 --> 04:12.084
Here we go. And...

04:12.169 --> 04:13.336
Swing them to the left

04:13.420 --> 04:15.463
Then you swing them
to the right

04:15.547 --> 04:18.757
Then you do the twist
with all of your might

04:18.841 --> 04:22.094
Truck on down
Let's go to town

04:22.179 --> 04:24.597
And that's what
we call dancing

04:24.681 --> 04:25.723
Let me hear it.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.225
And that's what
we call dancing

04:28.310 --> 04:31.854
Hit it.
That's much better.

04:31.939 --> 04:35.733
Come on, ladies.
Pick them up. Very good.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.109
I mean,
I have to share everything.

04:37.194 --> 04:38.945
Girls, that's wonderful.

04:39.029 --> 04:42.281
I saw this, but I fell asleep.
So I don't know how it ends.

04:42.366 --> 04:44.909
Shake your little shoulders
and get on down

04:44.993 --> 04:48.537
Do the Susy-Q
That's good for you

04:48.622 --> 04:50.998
And that's what
we call dancing

04:51.083 --> 04:52.124
Let me hear it.

04:52.209 --> 04:53.709
And that's
what we call dancing

04:53.794 --> 04:55.962
Hey, Art. Art.

04:58.215 --> 04:59.674
Come on over here.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.842
I could use
some real men here.

05:01.927 --> 05:03.427
If we see any,
we'll send them over.

05:05.222 --> 05:06.639
Hit it.
Yes, yes.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.976
Here we go. And...

05:10.060 --> 05:11.394
Swing them to the left

05:11.478 --> 05:13.479
You ever going to do anything
about that one?

05:13.563 --> 05:15.189
Already have.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.317
Put it to her?

05:18.402 --> 05:19.819
You're disgusting.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.739
So then you haven't, huh?

05:23.824 --> 05:24.824
What?

05:24.908 --> 05:26.951
I say, "So then you haven't."

05:30.539 --> 05:31.747
Here you go, Pops.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.250
Ben. I said one.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.669
Walk on the wild side.

05:36.753 --> 05:39.255
You boys still
trespassing over there?

05:39.798 --> 05:41.132
Yep.

05:42.467 --> 05:46.429
Hey, they're not
even melted yet. Wow.

05:48.306 --> 05:49.640
Okay, let's get a board
under her.

05:49.725 --> 05:50.683
Let's get a pulse,
let's get a blood pressure.

05:51.893 --> 05:53.686
I'll get a line.
No pulse.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.771
Eighty over 50.
Keep pumping.

05:55.856 --> 05:56.856
Ready!

05:56.940 --> 05:58.649
Clear.
Now.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.192
Is there a pulse
or a blood pressure?

06:00.277 --> 06:02.862
Once more.
Everyone off now.

06:02.946 --> 06:03.946
Is there a pulse?
No pulse.

06:05.115 --> 06:06.282
Blood pressure?
No blood pressure.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.616
All right.
Let's call it.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.797
Well, what's the word?

06:21.882 --> 06:23.340
What's the word on what?

06:24.468 --> 06:25.843
The doctor.
That's what.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.553
You went to the doctor.
Now, what'd he say?

06:27.637 --> 06:30.222
It's a breeze.
Everything's fine.

06:30.307 --> 06:31.640
Hey, wait a minute.

06:32.476 --> 06:34.351
Wait right there.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.397
This is me
you're talking to.

06:38.482 --> 06:42.193
Now, you went to the goddamn doctor.
Now, what did he say?

06:44.905 --> 06:47.156
Doctors don't
know everything.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.918
Well, there is the one school
of thought

06:59.002 --> 07:00.836
that says they don't
know nothing.

07:47.759 --> 07:50.719
Well, gentlemen,
mission accomplished.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.142
Hope the water
isn't too cold.

07:56.226 --> 07:57.977
You want it
heated, too?

07:58.061 --> 07:59.645
What about a lifeguard?

08:03.984 --> 08:06.652
Well, the marines
have landed.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.574
The navy's in.

08:14.286 --> 08:16.078
Boy, that's cold.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.538
You're right.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.834
Ah!

08:22.544 --> 08:24.879
Fellows, this is the life.

08:34.054 --> 08:36.265
That'll make your old
ball sac shrivel up.

08:48.111 --> 08:50.863
Well, all in all, that was
a pretty damn crappy day at sea,

08:50.947 --> 08:52.072
wasn't it, boys?

08:52.157 --> 08:53.824
You stink.

08:53.909 --> 08:55.075
Me?

08:55.327 --> 08:57.536
Come on, man.
It's the great unknown out there.

08:57.621 --> 08:59.705
Here.
Here's half your money.

08:59.789 --> 09:02.041
"Half"? What do you...
What is this "half"?

09:02.125 --> 09:04.710
Bonner, you got my
goddamn money now?

09:04.794 --> 09:06.337
Got it right here.
I got it right here.

09:06.421 --> 09:07.880
I'll be with you
in a second, okay?

09:07.964 --> 09:11.425
'Cause if you ain't got it now,
you're not tying up here.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.886
Look, I don't want to get rough
with you, you know,

09:13.970 --> 09:15.387
but I'm not taking half.

09:15.472 --> 09:16.513
Fine. Give it.

09:16.598 --> 09:18.390
What are you...
Get your hands off.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.476
Just get your ass
off my boat, man.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.769
Just get your
ass off my boat.

09:21.853 --> 09:23.020
You believe this?

09:23.104 --> 09:26.857
And take your embarrassing
beach towel with you.

09:26.942 --> 09:29.068
Guy brings a beach towel.
You believe these tourists?

09:29.152 --> 09:33.405
Guy throws up on the deck, he doesn't
catch one fish, gives me half my money.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.491
I need a brew.
You want something cold?

09:35.575 --> 09:36.659
Untie the boat line.

09:36.743 --> 09:39.078
No, wait a minute.
Don't untie the boat line.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.288
Here you go, you bloodsucker.
I have nothing to live on.

09:41.373 --> 09:42.957
Nothing. Zip.

09:45.126 --> 09:49.338
Kirk, come on. You're not actually
gonna take all my money, are you?

09:50.173 --> 09:52.508
You're gonna leave me with
five bucks, aren't you, Kirk?

09:52.592 --> 09:54.468
Not on your life.

09:54.552 --> 09:55.844
Shit!

09:55.929 --> 09:57.846
Come on, Kirk. That money
will bring you no pleasure!

09:57.931 --> 09:59.890
I promise you.
Can I have a word...

09:59.975 --> 10:01.558
You just try
and sleep tonight!

10:01.643 --> 10:03.852
I'll sleep like a baby.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.230
Shit!

10:16.074 --> 10:18.158
We'd like to
rent your boat.

10:18.243 --> 10:19.285
You what?

10:19.369 --> 10:21.870
We'd like to
rent your boat.

10:21.955 --> 10:26.250
We'd like to rent
your boat for 27 days,

10:26.334 --> 10:28.294
if that wouldn't be
too long for you.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.713
No. Yeah.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.799
Yeah? Twenty-seven?

10:35.218 --> 10:38.971
That's my lucky number.
Holy smokes!

10:39.055 --> 10:41.765
Hi. I'm Jack Bonner.
How you doing?

10:41.850 --> 10:43.017
Hi, Jack. I'm Walter.

10:43.101 --> 10:45.019
Hi. Hi, Walter.
Well, come on.

10:48.606 --> 10:51.066
Yeah, take a look around.
Boat sleeps eight,

10:51.151 --> 10:52.985
so you should be
pretty comfortable.

10:53.069 --> 10:56.280
And if you've got a latitude
and a longitude, I can get you there.

10:56.364 --> 10:58.240
And if you don't,
I can still get you there.

10:58.325 --> 11:01.035
We know a great dive spot,
and we have a map.

11:02.537 --> 11:04.371
Great, great.

11:05.248 --> 11:07.750
I guess we can
talk price later.

11:08.835 --> 11:12.004
That door basically
slides back and forth.

11:12.088 --> 11:15.215
It may need some oil.
I haven't dusted in a while,

11:15.300 --> 11:18.844
but I'm gonna do a whole cleanup,
a whole sanitation thing.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.387
You know, if you look
at anything closely enough,

11:20.472 --> 11:22.306
you're bound
to find some flaws.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.350
I'm an experienced
scuba diver

11:24.434 --> 11:26.894
and tour guide,
deep-sea fisherman,

11:26.978 --> 11:30.230
who'll actually
eat tonight. Yes!

11:37.947 --> 11:40.824
In the kitchen.
You're in the kitchen.

11:41.826 --> 11:46.121
And my mother came out on the porch,
and she was screaming...

11:46.206 --> 11:47.581
Give it a rest, Rose.

11:47.665 --> 11:50.542
"You stop
teasing your sister!"

11:51.503 --> 11:52.503
Hiya, Grandpa.

11:52.587 --> 11:53.754
There's the little fellow.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.506
You come right to the courts,
do you?

11:55.590 --> 11:57.091
It's Thursday.

11:57.175 --> 11:59.134
Knows our schedule.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.637
Hi!

12:01.721 --> 12:02.721
Hello, David.

12:02.806 --> 12:04.390
Hello, David.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.100
He's always here.

12:06.184 --> 12:08.060
Does this kid have
a home or what?

12:08.144 --> 12:10.813
Bernie, his parents are divorced.
His mother works.

12:10.897 --> 12:14.650
Hey, I'm an orphan.
Do I go around asking for breaks?

12:16.111 --> 12:20.197
We're going swimming later.
We have room left for one little boy.

12:20.281 --> 12:22.950
And we might even have
a swimming suit for you.

12:23.034 --> 12:25.369
I got mine on.

12:25.954 --> 12:28.747
The navy could
use men like you.

12:34.087 --> 12:37.923
The property's been tied up in
an estate now for over three years.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.509
And, of course,
they really want to sell.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.970
They're not interested
in a long-term lease.

12:43.054 --> 12:45.764
Well, we'd just
like the place for 26 days.

12:45.849 --> 12:48.559
And we'll take it
in "as is" condition.

12:50.311 --> 12:51.687
We're cousins.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.565
We like to vacation
together informally.

12:54.649 --> 12:58.485
As long as there's a swimming pool,
we have everything we need.

12:58.570 --> 13:03.365
$7,500 a month, plus the pool man
and utilities.

13:03.741 --> 13:05.993
We won't be needing
the pool man.

13:06.077 --> 13:09.288
I prefer to do that myself.
They use so much chlorine.

13:09.372 --> 13:11.206
My eyes are very sensitive.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.125
But they're lovely.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.585
Thank you.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.756
The clubhouse
is closed, boys.

13:19.841 --> 13:23.802
Well, maybe they'd give us permission
to use the pool.

13:23.887 --> 13:25.179
We could offer
to pay something.

13:25.263 --> 13:27.973
Wouldn't be fun
if we had permission.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.958
Jack, this is the chart
I was telling you about.

13:55.043 --> 13:58.670
I estimate our position is
right about here, at this point.

13:58.755 --> 14:00.672
I want to get down right along
this fault line.

14:00.757 --> 14:01.840
Just south, right here.

14:01.925 --> 14:03.217
Is this land?
What is this?

14:03.301 --> 14:06.303
This is actually an underwater
configuration map.

14:06.387 --> 14:08.388
It's a heat-sensitive map.
I've seen these.

14:08.473 --> 14:09.890
Yeah, it's a brand-new development.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.934
The Japanese have this.

14:12.018 --> 14:14.561
Yeah, that's right, Jack.
The Japanese. They developed it.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.438
So the point is to
head directly south

14:16.523 --> 14:18.190
right along this line...
Sure.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.692
...until we get right here
on the edge of this fault line.

14:20.777 --> 14:22.110
Perfect.
Can you figure that out?

14:22.195 --> 14:24.863
Yeah. Actually,
I've been around here.

14:24.948 --> 14:26.907
Why don't you keep this?
Okay. All right.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.575
Go get some sodas and sandwiches
and stuff.

14:28.660 --> 14:29.660
Thanks, Jack.

14:29.744 --> 14:30.953
Okay.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.258
All right.
Let's start with line three.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.301
"T, O, Z."

14:46.469 --> 14:47.803
And the next line.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.806
"L, P, E, O."

14:52.809 --> 14:55.143
Try the next line.

15:01.526 --> 15:04.027
"K, O, C..."

15:08.074 --> 15:12.035
"K, O, C, F, E."

15:15.498 --> 15:17.916
Sir, do you have
another pair of glasses?

15:18.001 --> 15:20.460
I don't need any other glasses,
young man.

15:20.545 --> 15:23.297
These are my glasses.
I can read that fine.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.674
Now you just run the pointer.
All right?

15:28.344 --> 15:30.220
Next line.

15:36.019 --> 15:38.604
Sir, is there anything on that line
you can read?

15:38.688 --> 15:40.022
No.

15:40.690 --> 15:44.401
But, young man, remember, road signs
aren't made that small.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.570
I can read road signs.

15:49.324 --> 15:50.532
Okay.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.037
I don't think it's fair.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.789
I've driven everything on wheels
all my life.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.541
Never had a mishap.

16:04.589 --> 16:07.299
Shit. How's your girlfriend?

16:08.217 --> 16:10.260
She's not
my girlfriend.

16:10.345 --> 16:12.346
She just followed me
home that one day.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.806
I don't like her
at all.

16:14.891 --> 16:15.932
You don't, huh?

16:17.435 --> 16:19.311
Hi, Dad.
Hi, honey.

16:19.395 --> 16:21.480
Hi, Mom.

16:21.564 --> 16:23.190
Want to go out to dinner?

16:23.274 --> 16:24.274
Yeah.

16:24.359 --> 16:27.277
No Italian food.
Makes me fart.

16:27.362 --> 16:29.404
Okay. I'll go get Mom.

16:30.073 --> 16:32.157
You know, you're gonna have to
make a friend your own age

16:32.241 --> 16:34.284
one of these days.

16:34.369 --> 16:36.578
I don't like
the kids my age.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.497
I like to hang
around you guys.

16:38.581 --> 16:39.873
Sure you like it here.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.751
There's no pressure,
and we baby you.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.253
It's just that a lot more things bother
me than other guys.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.838
They do, do they?

16:46.923 --> 16:48.674
The trouble with you
is you think too much,

16:48.758 --> 16:51.259
and that's when
a guy gets scared.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.720
You know, Grandpa,
you're right.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.515
I do get scared a lot.

16:56.599 --> 16:58.600
Nobody likes being scared.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.941
Hey, watch out.
Those dolphins look pretty horny.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.586
This is pretty big.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.713
Yeah, pretty big.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.298
You need a hand?

18:53.382 --> 18:55.467
No. No. Thanks, Jack.
We're doing fine.

18:55.551 --> 18:56.885
Excuse me.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.229
What the hell is that?

19:07.313 --> 19:08.855
Who cares?

19:08.940 --> 19:11.858
You know what I bet?
I bet they're dope peddlers.

19:11.943 --> 19:14.945
I'll bet they made
a pickup out at sea.

19:15.029 --> 19:16.613
It's possible.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.073
Should we tell somebody?

19:18.908 --> 19:20.075
No.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.459
Well, by golly,
if our new neighbors are gonna do that,

19:29.544 --> 19:32.003
I don't feel a bit bad about
sneaking in their swimming pool

19:32.088 --> 19:33.839
while they're gone.

19:33.923 --> 19:35.215
Do you think it's safe?

19:35.299 --> 19:36.842
What are they gonna do?
Arrest us?

19:36.926 --> 19:39.302
Look at us. We're
three harmless old men.

19:39.387 --> 19:42.597
Yeah, but who knows
what kind of people they are?

19:46.686 --> 19:50.814
You know, I can't remember the
last time I really took a risk.

19:52.817 --> 19:55.777
Ben's right. I'm in.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.240
What the hell.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.625
Look at that.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.714
The water's really warm.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.758
What the hell are those?

20:24.849 --> 20:26.766
Listen to that.

20:36.193 --> 20:38.278
They make me nervous.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.742
If your friend Ben Luckett
decides to jump off

20:43.826 --> 20:45.076
the top of
the Empire State Building,

20:45.161 --> 20:47.746
does that mean that you have to
do it, too?

20:47.830 --> 20:49.956
I have my pride.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.170
Well.

21:08.059 --> 21:09.559
I feel great!

21:09.644 --> 21:10.685
Me, too.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.855
You wouldn't bullshit me.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.900
My God,
I'm telling the truth.

21:18.527 --> 21:21.780
Why shouldn't he feel good?
I feel tremendous!

21:21.864 --> 21:23.698
I'm ready to
take on the world!

22:26.595 --> 22:30.348
I'm in the mood for love

22:30.433 --> 22:34.185
Simply because you're near me

22:36.731 --> 22:38.481
You get a load
of this guy?

22:38.566 --> 22:42.152
He'll be chasing them dolls
till his dick rots off.

22:42.236 --> 22:44.529
I'm too old for
that kind of thing.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.531
Age isn't everything.

22:46.615 --> 22:47.741
No, no.

22:47.825 --> 22:49.159
Anyway,
it's all up here.

22:49.243 --> 22:50.285
Sure, sure.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.078
Not all up there, pal.

22:52.163 --> 22:53.830
Some of it's down here.

22:53.914 --> 22:57.000
Which, by the way,
is hard as a rock.

22:57.084 --> 22:59.294
You, too?
You got a boner, too?

22:59.378 --> 23:02.589
Blue steel.
Cat couldn't scratch it.

23:02.673 --> 23:04.716
I thought I was
the only one.

23:07.970 --> 23:11.306
We're in the mood for love

23:11.390 --> 23:14.142
Simply because we've got one

23:32.328 --> 23:34.579
You tired?

23:34.663 --> 23:35.789
Aren't you?

23:37.666 --> 23:40.585
I'm wide awake.

23:40.669 --> 23:41.836
What's wrong?

23:42.505 --> 23:44.589
Not a thing.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.550
Art. It's so late.

24:30.052 --> 24:32.345
Are you all right?

24:32.429 --> 24:34.806
Some enchanted evening

24:35.683 --> 24:38.977
You may see a stranger

24:39.061 --> 24:42.147
You may see a stranger

24:42.231 --> 24:44.899
Across a crowded room

25:05.337 --> 25:06.671
Want a piece of candy,
little girl?

25:06.755 --> 25:08.590
Ben!

25:08.674 --> 25:10.091
Ben.

25:22.605 --> 25:24.022
Pong.

25:25.774 --> 25:27.901
Three. Ghost dragon.

25:31.947 --> 25:34.282
Why is everybody
so quiet today?

25:34.366 --> 25:37.076
You're all off in another world
or something.

25:37.161 --> 25:39.537
I was just
thinking to myself.

25:39.622 --> 25:43.291
Me, too.
I was just thinking.

25:46.295 --> 25:50.006
I feel so nice today,
I can't tell you.

26:13.822 --> 26:15.490
Joe.

26:16.367 --> 26:18.034
Let's go!

26:21.664 --> 26:22.664
Morning. Morning.

26:22.748 --> 26:23.790
Hi.

26:27.670 --> 26:29.837
Shit. Excuse me.

26:34.677 --> 26:36.469
Do you think there's
cocaine in that pool?

26:36.553 --> 26:38.554
There might be.

26:45.354 --> 26:47.272
What if we OD?

26:47.356 --> 26:49.649
Well, we'll keep an eye
on each other.

26:49.733 --> 26:52.527
I'll watch him. You watch him.
You watch me.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.195
Perfect.

27:40.576 --> 27:41.784
Stop!

28:36.298 --> 28:37.799
Hey.

28:38.592 --> 28:39.926
Hi.

28:40.511 --> 28:42.887
Looks like you got these things
pretty well-covered.

28:42.971 --> 28:44.847
Looks airtight.

28:45.516 --> 28:48.559
Jack, I can't tell you
what's inside there.

28:52.314 --> 28:55.024
You know,
I'm the captain.

28:55.651 --> 28:59.153
Technically speaking,
I have to know what's in there.

28:59.696 --> 29:02.573
Yeah, but what we're doing
is supposed to be a secret.

29:02.658 --> 29:04.992
Kitty,
I took a maritime oath,

29:05.077 --> 29:06.536
a maritime oath
that forbids me

29:06.620 --> 29:09.414
to even reveal
your names to anybody.

29:10.332 --> 29:13.084
All right. I'll tell you,
but you can't let the others know

29:13.168 --> 29:15.837
that I told you anything.

29:15.921 --> 29:17.630
They'd have to
torture me.

29:17.714 --> 29:21.092
Not a lot of torture.
You know, not... But some.

29:23.679 --> 29:26.305
Nerita peloronta.

29:26.390 --> 29:27.473
What?

29:27.558 --> 29:29.392
Nerita peloronta.

29:30.686 --> 29:32.103
What is that?

29:32.187 --> 29:34.355
They're giant snail shells.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.024
Hmm.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.361
They're extremely rare.

29:40.446 --> 29:43.364
We're gonna take them to the
Museum of Ichthyology in Orlando.

29:43.449 --> 29:45.116
Really?

29:45.200 --> 29:46.784
Yeah, I've been
planning to go there.

29:46.869 --> 29:48.870
I hear it's a great place,
a lot of fish.

29:52.499 --> 29:56.252
God! God, I think it's broken.
God damn it!

29:56.336 --> 29:57.378
Let me help you.

29:57.463 --> 29:59.130
Ice. Get something
cold on it.

29:59.214 --> 30:00.506
Let me just look.

30:00.591 --> 30:01.632
No, no. Don't.
Do not touch it.

30:01.717 --> 30:03.426
I can... I can help you.

30:03.510 --> 30:04.802
No. No, no.

30:12.769 --> 30:14.979
That feels nice.

30:19.401 --> 30:21.068
It's amazing.

30:23.780 --> 30:26.157
Kitty, are you married?

30:26.241 --> 30:27.325
No.

30:27.409 --> 30:28.659
Involved?

30:28.744 --> 30:29.827
No.

30:29.912 --> 30:32.079
Come on.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.499
Those guys are
so good-looking.

30:34.583 --> 30:36.250
Not Walter, maybe,
but...

30:37.836 --> 30:40.171
You don't have anything going
with one of those young guys?

30:40.255 --> 30:42.673
I'm not involved
with anyone.

30:42.758 --> 30:44.008
Okay.

30:45.302 --> 30:49.096
You know, we could go out
and do something sometime.

30:50.432 --> 30:51.849
I don't know if that's such
a good idea.

30:51.934 --> 30:53.601
Why?

30:54.728 --> 30:57.104
I'm not like the other women
you've known.

30:57.189 --> 30:58.898
That's good news.

31:03.820 --> 31:06.697
You're making me
very curious about you.

31:07.950 --> 31:11.536
Well, what if I trusted you
with something very private?

31:11.620 --> 31:13.788
I can keep a secret.
I won't tell anybody.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.164
Not even our kids.

31:20.087 --> 31:23.506
Look, I don't know
what you're thinking,

31:23.590 --> 31:28.886
but if you're thinking
that I'm just out to nail you,

31:30.305 --> 31:31.556
that's not it at all.

31:31.640 --> 31:35.101
I'd just like to get to know you
as a human being.

31:40.107 --> 31:42.900
Okay. I'll see you in the morning.
All right?

31:42.985 --> 31:44.485
What...

31:49.032 --> 31:52.326
Yeah, I got...
I got some things to do, too.

31:56.164 --> 31:59.792
And they didn't give you
any other medication at all

31:59.876 --> 32:01.085
over at the home, huh?

32:01.169 --> 32:03.170
Not a thing, Doc.

32:03.255 --> 32:05.506
Well, Joe,
I gotta tell you,

32:05.591 --> 32:08.759
I have never seen anything
like this before in my life.

32:08.844 --> 32:11.637
It's a...
Well, it's a miracle.

32:11.722 --> 32:13.514
It's a complete remission.

32:17.853 --> 32:21.564
I just love to see you
eat your words, Doc.

32:21.648 --> 32:23.107
Want to arm-wrestle?

32:25.152 --> 32:27.028
How about that?

32:55.557 --> 32:56.599
Alma's not gonna believe it.

32:56.683 --> 32:58.809
You got them, huh?

32:59.144 --> 33:01.228
Come on.
Let's go, shall we?

33:20.749 --> 33:23.918
I'm gonna go ahead
and assume goodwill.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.545
I'm gonna assume
mental illness.

33:27.381 --> 33:30.132
I didn't expect it.
It's such a surprise.

33:30.258 --> 33:33.928
I don't know how to do it.
I didn't buy it. It's just beautiful.

33:39.059 --> 33:41.310
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

33:41.395 --> 33:44.063
We start our second session
of dancing right now.

33:44.147 --> 33:48.401
And our first tune is a special
arrangement of Dancing in the Dark.

33:49.152 --> 33:51.404
Let's waste no time.

34:27.232 --> 34:28.649
Why don't we dance?

34:28.817 --> 34:30.275
What? Sure.

34:48.879 --> 34:50.504
Bernie, Bernie, Bernie.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.547
What am I going
to do with you?

34:52.632 --> 34:55.467
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

34:55.552 --> 34:57.136
Well, you're not
going to dance with me.

34:57.220 --> 35:00.347
That's for sure.
That's for sure.

35:03.059 --> 35:06.103
Happy birthday! Many more!
Thank you.

35:09.566 --> 35:11.484
You're a wonderful dancer.

35:11.568 --> 35:13.736
I think so.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.863
I'm very happy, Bess.

35:16.698 --> 35:19.116
Everything's
happening so fast.

35:19.785 --> 35:21.577
Are you talking
about last night?

35:21.661 --> 35:24.330
No, no.
Last night was fine.

35:24.414 --> 35:26.415
Fine?

35:26.500 --> 35:27.833
More than fine.

35:27.918 --> 35:29.293
Terrific.

35:30.086 --> 35:32.463
I was talking in general.

35:32.547 --> 35:37.384
Well, in general,
I think we're having a great time.

35:38.929 --> 35:40.721
Yes, we are.

35:42.933 --> 35:45.351
Will you still love me
when I can't keep up with you?

35:45.435 --> 35:48.979
Of course. I love you now,
and you can't keep up with me.

35:49.064 --> 35:51.398
You are a pain in the ass.

36:06.331 --> 36:10.084
"There's going to be a problem in the
fuel injection system if you let..."

36:10.961 --> 36:12.962
What does this do?

36:45.078 --> 36:48.622
Reduced to a goddamn
Peeping Tom now, Bonner?

36:48.707 --> 36:50.332
It's embarrassing.

37:55.523 --> 37:56.690
Holy shit.

38:18.546 --> 38:20.923
What's the problem, Jack?

38:21.007 --> 38:22.549
She's not normal.

38:24.886 --> 38:27.888
There's something
very abnormal about her.

38:33.812 --> 38:36.730
Come on. Come on. Come on.

38:39.317 --> 38:40.985
Son of a bitch!

38:42.821 --> 38:44.405
All right.

38:51.746 --> 38:53.497
Come on! Start! Go!

38:55.959 --> 38:58.002
I've put all kinds of
people on this boat.

38:58.086 --> 39:00.295
All kinds, all races.
Come on.

39:00.380 --> 39:03.048
All nationalities,
all creeds!

39:03.133 --> 39:06.343
I... Oh, my God!
I can't believe it won't start!

39:13.601 --> 39:15.310
Oh, my God.

39:30.076 --> 39:34.371
It's... It's hard to know
who to trust, isn't it, Jack?

39:37.459 --> 39:40.669
Oh, my God! God.

39:54.642 --> 39:57.478
I'm in the water,
far from shore.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.314
It's at night.

40:00.857 --> 40:03.650
They've got my boat. Shit.

40:13.161 --> 40:15.037
Good to see you again, Jack.

40:15.163 --> 40:17.206
Let me give you a hand.
I don't want your hand.

40:17.290 --> 40:18.248
Come on, Jack.

40:18.333 --> 40:19.458
Get back! Get back!

40:19.542 --> 40:21.710
You get back!

40:27.550 --> 40:30.761
No. Just put...
Put the towel down.

40:31.513 --> 40:34.181
Just put it down
and back away, please.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.646
Jack, I'm sure you're bothered
by what you've seen,

40:40.730 --> 40:41.772
but if you'll just relax...

40:41.856 --> 40:43.273
Well, I don't
want to relax.

40:43.358 --> 40:44.358
Why don't you let us explain?

40:44.442 --> 40:46.819
'Cause I don't want
to know anything.

40:46.903 --> 40:50.114
And if you try to eat my face off
or take over my body,

40:50.198 --> 40:51.281
you're gonna be
very sorry, mister!

40:51.366 --> 40:52.908
You're gonna be
very sorry!

40:54.410 --> 40:56.620
Face-eating, Jack?

40:56.704 --> 41:00.624
I've never heard of that.
Is that some sort of delicacy?

41:00.708 --> 41:03.627
No. Forget I ever
mentioned it.

41:03.711 --> 41:04.878
Are you sure I shouldn't try it,
Jack?

41:04.963 --> 41:06.463
I'm positive.

41:06.548 --> 41:09.007
Walter, Jack is our friend.
Right, Jack?

41:09.092 --> 41:10.592
Friend. Friend!
That's right.

41:10.677 --> 41:12.636
Friend, 100%.
I'm your friend.

41:12.720 --> 41:15.222
That's all I ever wanted to be.
I want to be your friend.

41:15.306 --> 41:16.807
Well, we do owe
you an explanation.

41:16.891 --> 41:18.642
No, you don't
owe me anything.

41:18.726 --> 41:20.811
All right. You know,
not even for the boat.

41:20.895 --> 41:22.938
Honestly, it's free.

41:23.022 --> 41:26.650
Jack.
Of course we're gonna pay you
for the boat. We're honest.

41:26.734 --> 41:28.318
Of course you're honest.

41:28.403 --> 41:31.363
Did I ever accuse you
of being dishonest?

41:31.447 --> 41:35.033
I accused you of being from another
planet, but an honest planet.

41:35.118 --> 41:37.327
Jack. Jack, sit down.

41:37.412 --> 41:38.412
I don't wanna sit down.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.497
Jack, sit!

41:45.545 --> 41:49.006
Now, Jack, I want you to
listen to me very carefully.

41:49.716 --> 41:52.050
We're Antareans.

41:52.135 --> 41:54.011
We come from
a planet called Antarea.

41:54.095 --> 41:56.388
Yeah, that's what I
pretty much figured.

41:56.472 --> 41:59.099
About 100 centuries ago,
we had an outpost here on Earth,

41:59.184 --> 42:00.976
before the first upheaval.

42:01.060 --> 42:02.477
I think I'm better off
not knowing.

42:05.106 --> 42:08.358
Now, we were able to evacuate
everyone except for my ground crew.

42:08.443 --> 42:10.194
Ground crew?

42:10.278 --> 42:11.737
And now we've
come back for them.

42:15.909 --> 42:19.077
Boy, you know, I thought
I'd been around. I...

42:19.162 --> 42:20.996
Nothing like this has ever
happened to me before.

42:21.080 --> 42:26.043
Jack, you could turn us in,
or perhaps you could do something else

42:26.127 --> 42:28.295
that would make
things difficult for us,

42:28.379 --> 42:32.799
but, believe me, Jack,
we will still get our friends back.

42:32.884 --> 42:35.636
And the only thing
that would happen

42:35.720 --> 42:38.680
is we'd end up renting
someone else's boat.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.482
You know,
I got left behind once.

42:48.566 --> 42:51.985
It was in Coney Island.
I was nine.

42:52.070 --> 42:54.112
It was pretty heavy
for a nine-year-old.

42:54.822 --> 42:56.114
My parents finally
came back for me.

42:56.199 --> 42:57.241
Of course.

42:57.325 --> 42:58.325
Yeah.

42:58.409 --> 42:59.493
And now we've come back.

42:59.577 --> 43:02.037
So that's what you're doing?
You're coming back for your friends?

43:02.121 --> 43:03.872
Exactly.

43:03.957 --> 43:08.126
Jack, this is the most
important thing we've ever done.

43:13.091 --> 43:16.218
You're not gonna hurt me,
are you, Walt?

43:16.302 --> 43:19.596
All we need to do is to get
our friends and leave.

43:20.181 --> 43:21.848
And go...

43:23.184 --> 43:24.893
Yes.

43:24.978 --> 43:26.186
Right.

43:28.231 --> 43:30.607
None of this is bad
for America, I guess.

43:30.692 --> 43:32.234
Of course not.

43:34.988 --> 43:37.030
Well, damn it, I'm in!

43:39.033 --> 43:41.285
This is...
This is incredible.

43:42.203 --> 43:45.247
Right. Now listen, tell me, nothing's
gonna fall off right now, is it?

43:45.331 --> 43:46.665
No.

43:47.709 --> 43:50.294
Come on, Mr. Lefkowitz.

43:50.378 --> 43:51.962
You'll be a new man,
Bernie. Believe me.

43:52.046 --> 43:54.631
Remember, I said...
I said I'd look. Grab there.

43:54.716 --> 43:56.425
I'm not promising
I'll get wet.

43:56.509 --> 43:58.051
Fine. Just look.

43:58.136 --> 44:01.471
By the way, right here is where
a crime is being committed.

44:01.556 --> 44:03.849
Not by me,
because I'm being carried.

44:03.933 --> 44:06.143
Don't you worry, Bernie.
We'll take the fall for you.

44:06.227 --> 44:07.644
Fall, fall.
That's another thing.

44:07.729 --> 44:10.731
I fall, I break my hip,
I can't sue anybody.

44:16.571 --> 44:17.863
It's nice and warm, Bernie.

44:17.947 --> 44:19.573
They're rocks.

44:20.366 --> 44:22.743
What are rocks
doing in a pool?

44:24.579 --> 44:28.248
In an ocean, fine. There I
expect to see plenty of rocks,

44:28.333 --> 44:29.958
but in a pool?

44:30.043 --> 44:31.585
No.

44:39.218 --> 44:42.721
Cowardly, cowardly custard,
can't cut the mustard!

44:44.599 --> 44:46.433
Come on, Bernie!

44:52.774 --> 44:56.151
And it's Joe-Joe
taking the lead.

44:57.487 --> 45:00.030
Come on! Come on!

45:00.114 --> 45:02.032
Come on,
you worn-out old pusses.

45:02.116 --> 45:03.700
Dig, dig, dig, dig!

45:03.951 --> 45:05.911
I'll see you tomorrow.

45:11.292 --> 45:13.377
Hey, fellows!
Fellows! Fellows!

45:13.461 --> 45:15.670
Hey! Somebody's coming!

45:15.797 --> 45:17.130
Get out.
Let's get the hell out of here.

45:17.215 --> 45:19.341
Let's get out of here.
Come on!

45:19.425 --> 45:20.717
Come on.
Get a move on.

45:20.802 --> 45:22.010
Hurry.

45:22.095 --> 45:23.261
Come on in here.

47:25.927 --> 47:28.011
Out of the way!
Let's move!

47:28.888 --> 47:29.846
Jesus!

47:29.931 --> 47:31.014
Let's move!
Come on! Quick!

47:31.098 --> 47:33.475
Come on.
Open the fucking door!

47:34.060 --> 47:36.978
Let's go! Go, go, go, go, go!
Let's go!

47:39.065 --> 47:41.066
Come on! Quick!

47:50.451 --> 47:52.536
I begged you not to go.

47:52.620 --> 47:54.204
You've got
to do something.

47:54.288 --> 47:56.665
There are things from outer space
next door.

47:56.749 --> 47:58.708
You gents just keep
sucking on that oxygen,

47:58.793 --> 48:01.086
they'll probably go back
to their own planet.

48:01.170 --> 48:03.046
Get the police, you idiots.

48:03.130 --> 48:04.339
Hey, look.

48:04.423 --> 48:06.716
I'm not calling no cops
because a couple of geezers

48:06.801 --> 48:09.511
saw some people
from outer space.

48:09.595 --> 48:12.180
If my husband said he saw people from
outer space,

48:12.265 --> 48:13.807
they were from outer space!

48:13.891 --> 48:15.809
Get the goddamn police!

48:15.893 --> 48:17.269
Okay.

48:19.522 --> 48:20.897
Call the police.

48:26.571 --> 48:29.406
They... They must have
concocted this crazy story

48:29.490 --> 48:30.657
to cover themselves.

48:30.741 --> 48:32.284
Spacemen, you say?
Yeah.

48:32.368 --> 48:33.577
That's wonderful.

48:33.661 --> 48:35.537
Well, we'll all be
that old someday.

48:35.621 --> 48:36.621
If we're lucky.

48:36.706 --> 48:37.914
Yeah.

48:37.999 --> 48:39.416
We're gonna shoot on
over to the home there

48:39.500 --> 48:40.750
and straighten
this whole thing out.

48:40.835 --> 48:42.460
Well, I wouldn't
be too hard on them.

48:42.545 --> 48:43.920
Just tell them that
as long as they're

48:44.005 --> 48:46.715
willing to respect our
privacy in the future,

48:46.799 --> 48:48.174
we won't press charges.

48:48.259 --> 48:49.342
We'll keep them on
their side of the fence.

48:49.427 --> 48:50.427
I appreciate it.

48:50.511 --> 48:51.595
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much.

48:51.679 --> 48:53.680
My pleasure. Bye-bye.

49:00.605 --> 49:04.024
Well, I guess we shouldn't
be greedy about it.

49:04.817 --> 49:07.819
We're better off
than before we found it.

49:07.903 --> 49:10.780
Bess said we should take it to
the National Enquirer.

49:10.865 --> 49:13.408
They pay money for
this kind of story.

49:13.492 --> 49:16.453
I wish I had
the guts to go in.

49:16.537 --> 49:17.787
Yeah.

49:18.414 --> 49:21.750
Well, I wish I never even
knew about this place.

49:40.770 --> 49:42.270
What time is it?

49:42.396 --> 49:44.230
Just after 4:00.

50:27.108 --> 50:28.191
I'm gonna go talk to them.

50:28.275 --> 50:30.777
God damn it.
It's ridiculous.

50:54.593 --> 50:56.386
You're Walter.

50:58.431 --> 51:01.141
Well, I'm not
surprised you're here.

51:02.435 --> 51:03.893
There's something
in that pool out there

51:03.978 --> 51:06.062
that a friend of ours
just has to have.

51:06.147 --> 51:09.274
Matter of fact, there's a few of us
could use a little of it.

51:09.358 --> 51:11.067
Well, we don't care who you are
or where you've been,

51:11.152 --> 51:14.320
what you're doing,
what you're up to.

51:14.405 --> 51:16.698
We sure need that pool.

51:18.325 --> 51:20.326
Look, Ben,

51:21.704 --> 51:24.831
I know you're just trying to
help your people.

51:25.458 --> 51:27.792
Well, I'm trying
to help mine.

51:28.335 --> 51:32.881
No. See, my friend,
Joe Finley, he's got cancer.

51:36.844 --> 51:39.095
I'm trying to
save his life.

51:40.055 --> 51:44.684
I'm trying to save 20 lives,
and I'm running out of time.

51:50.399 --> 51:51.775
Ain't a son of
a bitch in the world

51:51.859 --> 51:53.318
has to know
we're in that pool.

51:53.402 --> 51:56.696
We'll just be a few old farts
puddling around in that pool.

51:56.781 --> 51:58.740
Who's gonna know?

52:11.879 --> 52:15.590
Every 10,000 or 11,000 years or so,
I make a terrible mistake.

52:17.885 --> 52:22.013
The last one was when I picked
what you call Atlantis

52:22.097 --> 52:23.306
as our base here on Earth.

52:23.390 --> 52:27.602
Everyone else said, "Use the North Pole."
I said, "No. Too cold."

52:28.687 --> 52:31.272
Sinking never
occurred to me.

52:31.357 --> 52:33.775
You're gonna let us use the pool,
aren't you?

52:33.859 --> 52:36.653
You won't touch those cocoons?

52:36.737 --> 52:39.864
No. No. I swear.

52:41.951 --> 52:43.952
Use the pool.

52:46.664 --> 52:49.165
Thank you. Thank you.

52:56.465 --> 52:59.342
I, for one, don't believe this
alien crap at all.

52:59.426 --> 53:00.510
You don't believe
your husband?

53:00.594 --> 53:01.553
No.

53:01.637 --> 53:02.846
Well, I believe Joe.

53:02.930 --> 53:04.806
I believe him,
and I'm scared.

53:04.890 --> 53:07.141
I don't believe it,
and I'm still scared.

53:07.226 --> 53:09.143
I guess I'm just less
gullible than you guys.

53:09.228 --> 53:11.104
Mary, you have your nerve
calling me gullible.

53:11.188 --> 53:12.856
I have more horse sense
than you'll ever have.

53:12.940 --> 53:16.025
Ladies, ladies, let's just go and
see for ourselves.

53:16.110 --> 53:17.277
Come on.

53:17.361 --> 53:20.196
All right.
Let's meet the aliens.

53:20.281 --> 53:23.157
I hate to go visiting
without a plate of cookies,

53:23.242 --> 53:24.617
a box of candy or something.

53:24.702 --> 53:25.702
We're going home.

53:25.786 --> 53:27.036
Will you
cut it out, Bernie?

53:27.121 --> 53:28.746
Well, we have permission,
don't we?

53:28.831 --> 53:30.206
Those people aren't people.

53:30.291 --> 53:31.875
I'm not gonna have
anything to do with them.

53:31.959 --> 53:33.418
Pipe down.

53:33.502 --> 53:36.337
You're playing
with fire over there.

53:36.422 --> 53:38.882
I'm a citizen.
I believe in this country,

53:38.966 --> 53:41.759
and I'm thinking of blowing the
whistle on the whole goddamn deal.

53:41.844 --> 53:43.887
Come on, Rose.
Stop right there.

53:43.971 --> 53:45.680
What? What?

53:45.764 --> 53:48.516
Stop thinking about yourself.
We're doing this for Joe.

53:48.601 --> 53:51.728
Joe? Is Joe above the law?
Yeah.

53:51.812 --> 53:53.688
Are any of us?

53:53.772 --> 53:57.817
In 1948, Dutch Schultz
walked into my store,

53:57.902 --> 53:58.985
and he said to me...
Dutch Schultz!

53:59.069 --> 54:00.111
Bernie. Bernie, shut up.

54:00.195 --> 54:01.362
Let me tell you
about what Dutch said...

54:01.488 --> 54:03.948
Bernie. Bernie!

54:04.491 --> 54:06.200
If you don't want
to do this for Rose,

54:06.285 --> 54:08.244
if you don't want to do it for yourself,
that's fine,

54:08.329 --> 54:09.662
that's your business.

54:09.747 --> 54:10.914
But if you screw it up
for the rest of us...

54:10.998 --> 54:12.081
Don't threaten me, Joe.

54:12.166 --> 54:13.708
I don't want any
of your threats.

54:13.792 --> 54:15.752
Bernie, please.

54:15.836 --> 54:17.962
Let her come with us
just this once.

54:18.047 --> 54:19.756
No, no. Never.

54:19.840 --> 54:23.217
Rose and I will never
set foot over there again.

54:23.302 --> 54:25.845
Nature dealt us our hand of cards,
and we played them.

54:25.930 --> 54:27.096
Now, at the end of the game,

54:27.181 --> 54:30.642
suddenly you're looking to
reshuffle the deck, huh?

54:31.685 --> 54:34.520
Come on, Rose.
Come on. Let's go.

54:44.365 --> 54:46.699
Anybody have
second thoughts?

54:48.577 --> 54:49.786
Not me.

54:49.870 --> 54:51.371
I'm a citizen, too.

54:52.039 --> 54:54.123
I was in the navy.

54:54.208 --> 54:55.959
I don't see
anything wrong with it.

54:56.043 --> 54:58.044
Then you drive.

54:59.421 --> 55:01.214
I got no license.

55:38.877 --> 55:40.253
Hey, are
your extraterrestrials

55:40.337 --> 55:42.755
gonna make
a personal appearance?

55:43.257 --> 55:45.842
Hey, Pills.
Come on in.

55:48.303 --> 55:50.888
Hi, Pillsbury.
How you doing, pal?

55:50.973 --> 55:53.975
You'll like Pillsbury.
He's a fine fellow.

56:07.114 --> 56:09.741
All right.
Let's start here.

56:09.825 --> 56:12.618
"P, E, Z, O, L, C, F, T, D."

56:15.956 --> 56:18.041
Sir, what line
are you reading?

56:18.125 --> 56:20.168
The bottom one.

56:20.252 --> 56:23.087
We're in a little
bit of a hurry, okay?

56:40.773 --> 56:43.524
Look, look, look.
We gotta go into the club!

56:44.651 --> 56:49.030
I'm gonna take you higher
than you ever

56:49.114 --> 56:53.242
I'm gonna bring you
closer to the river

56:53.327 --> 56:57.747
I'm gonna touch you
Feel you with a thunder

56:57.831 --> 57:00.625
I'm gonna bring you
closer to my life

57:00.709 --> 57:05.421
You're like gravity
pulling me

57:05.506 --> 57:09.467
Gravity pulling me

57:10.302 --> 57:11.844
There you go!

57:14.348 --> 57:18.101
Gravity pulling me

57:18.185 --> 57:19.894
Pulling me

57:30.489 --> 57:32.573
Mutual affection

57:32.658 --> 57:34.742
Molecular reaction

57:34.827 --> 57:36.744
For every action

57:36.829 --> 57:39.122
There's an opposite reaction

57:39.206 --> 57:43.251
Modification
Love and variation

57:43.585 --> 57:46.796
First constellation
Needful simulation

57:47.131 --> 57:50.758
Gravity pulling me

57:51.468 --> 57:55.221
Gravity pulling me

57:55.305 --> 57:59.475
You're like gravity
pulling me

58:00.227 --> 58:02.812
Gravity pulling me

58:04.148 --> 58:06.190
Pulling me

58:12.239 --> 58:13.739
Hey, grandpa!

58:18.537 --> 58:20.663
Look at the old fogey!

58:23.417 --> 58:25.418
Off the floor, grandpa.

58:26.503 --> 58:28.129
Pulling me

58:28.672 --> 58:32.383
Gravity pulling me

58:32.467 --> 58:36.804
You're like gravity
pulling me

58:37.431 --> 58:41.142
Gravity pulling me

58:41.268 --> 58:43.186
Pulling me

58:43.937 --> 58:47.690
I've been to
all of the stars in the sky

58:47.774 --> 58:52.695
And I still can't believe it
Love conquers all

58:57.034 --> 59:00.953
Gravity pulling me

59:01.455 --> 59:05.082
Gravity pulling me

59:05.167 --> 59:09.962
You're like gravity
pulling me

59:10.047 --> 59:14.425
Gravity pulling me

59:23.393 --> 59:25.853
Any residents requiring
weekend transportation

59:25.938 --> 59:27.313
into St. Petersburg

59:27.397 --> 59:30.816
contact Miss Lerner
in her office by 1:00 today.

59:33.362 --> 59:35.404
Hey! Hey!

59:36.573 --> 59:38.741
I want to talk to you two!

59:41.245 --> 59:43.663
The word on the corridor
is that you dudes

59:43.747 --> 59:47.208
are on to some kind of
rejuvenation.

59:51.421 --> 59:53.005
What?

59:53.674 --> 59:55.758
You know what
I'm talking about.

59:55.842 --> 59:57.134
No, we don't.

59:58.303 --> 59:59.762
We wish we could help you.

59:59.846 --> 01:00:02.431
Your wife been climbing trees
for a long time?

01:00:04.518 --> 01:00:06.769
She climbs one
every once in a while.

01:00:06.853 --> 01:00:08.729
Once in a great while.

01:00:08.814 --> 01:00:10.064
That's right.

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:20.259
You know, whenever I'm around you,
I feel really good.

01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:24.347
Really good.
Do I do that to you?

01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:25.973
It happens.

01:01:28.643 --> 01:01:31.395
Do you ever want to
do anything about it?

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:34.440
Well, not the way
you think about it.

01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:39.403
I mean, I can't.

01:01:40.822 --> 01:01:42.448
Right.

01:01:43.116 --> 01:01:44.450
Right.

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:47.828
Well, how does an Antarean

01:01:50.957 --> 01:01:52.875
express affection?

01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:56.253
We share ourselves.

01:01:56.338 --> 01:01:57.630
All right!

01:01:58.298 --> 01:02:00.299
Do you want to try it?

01:02:03.303 --> 01:02:05.513
It's very fulfilling.

01:03:01.736 --> 01:03:03.863
Don't touch me.

01:03:04.531 --> 01:03:07.783
Don't touch you?
What's the big deal?

01:03:07.868 --> 01:03:09.660
All right. I'm gonna
tell you the truth.

01:03:09.744 --> 01:03:11.912
You're not
my first Antarean.

01:03:11.997 --> 01:03:13.372
I'm not naming names...
Jack...

01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:14.457
But...

01:03:14.541 --> 01:03:16.667
Go to the other
side of the pool.

01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:23.215
I hope you're not
gonna take your skin off,

01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:26.469
because I really like
skin on a woman.

01:04:36.081 --> 01:04:38.624
If this is foreplay,
I'm a dead man.

01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:46.382
Three strikes!

01:04:46.466 --> 01:04:49.635
Three strikes!
I knocked them down.

01:04:50.929 --> 01:04:54.223
You have
marvelous form.

01:04:54.307 --> 01:04:55.558
I've bowled with
a lot of women.

01:04:55.642 --> 01:04:57.059
You have a great potential.

01:04:57.143 --> 01:05:01.230
You know, you seem like you're
having a grand time. I know I am.

01:05:01.314 --> 01:05:03.274
Joe, you'll never bowl
another game like that

01:05:03.358 --> 01:05:04.441
as long as you live.

01:05:04.526 --> 01:05:06.443
Don't count on it.
I may turn professional.

01:05:06.528 --> 01:05:07.611
Yeah, sure.

01:05:07.696 --> 01:05:09.238
What's next? What's next?
What's next?

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:10.823
Let's have a party!

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:12.866
A party. I'm for that.

01:05:12.951 --> 01:05:16.203
You bring the hot dog
And I'll bring the bun

01:05:16.288 --> 01:05:18.330
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:21.208
What?

01:05:21.293 --> 01:05:22.835
Look at you goddamn people.

01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:25.212
I mean, I think this
is a serious mistake.

01:05:25.297 --> 01:05:27.548
What are you talking about?
A mistake about what?

01:05:27.632 --> 01:05:29.091
Well, you know,
I promised Walter

01:05:29.175 --> 01:05:31.468
we'd keep it a secret,
and look at this.

01:05:31.553 --> 01:05:35.180
Yeah. Let's not have
too much fun, everybody.

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:37.391
Remember, we're old.

01:05:39.227 --> 01:05:40.644
Not for me.
I'm gonna enjoy everything.

01:05:40.729 --> 01:05:41.770
You do that.

01:05:41.855 --> 01:05:42.938
Where to next, Ben?

01:05:43.023 --> 01:05:44.148
Home.

01:05:44.232 --> 01:05:45.816
Come on. Live a little.

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.443
Joe, Joe, Joe.
Everybody.

01:05:47.527 --> 01:05:48.902
Let's go home.
Get in, darling.

01:05:48.987 --> 01:05:50.446
But I'm not ready
to go home yet.

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:52.364
Come on, come on.
Let's go, let's go.

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:54.366
What's happening suddenly?

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:57.161
Well, I'll go with you, Joe.

01:05:57.245 --> 01:05:58.704
No, you go on home.

01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:00.414
I may have a drink or two.

01:06:02.042 --> 01:06:04.209
Will you keep that for me?

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:10.466
So, good night, you worriers.

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:13.218
Boy! Talk about wet blankets!

01:06:14.262 --> 01:06:16.180
Hey, I'll be fine.

01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:07.481
I still can't believe I did that.

01:07:07.565 --> 01:07:09.149
I always liked chocolate.

01:07:09.234 --> 01:07:11.944
I'll try not to dump
anything on you tonight.

01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:14.113
I mean, I can't promise,
but I'll try.

01:07:37.262 --> 01:07:38.804
Alma...

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:43.100
It's the pool.
It's having an effect...

01:07:43.184 --> 01:07:44.893
It's not the pool.
It's not the water.

01:07:44.978 --> 01:07:47.229
It's not the first time.

01:07:51.359 --> 01:07:52.568
Alma, you're overreacting.

01:07:52.652 --> 01:07:54.236
I knew. I always knew.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:56.905
I just pretended to be stupid,
and I guess I really was.

01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:58.824
No!
But you're the stupid one.

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:01.201
Because things have
been so good between us.

01:08:01.286 --> 01:08:03.245
Nothing's changed, Alma.
Go home, Joe.

01:08:03.329 --> 01:08:07.750
Don't make yourself look any more
ridiculous than you already are.

01:08:07.834 --> 01:08:12.212
I'm happy you're going to live, Joe,
but I've got to live, too.

01:09:29.082 --> 01:09:32.709
Joe. Joe. Try to relax.

01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:35.879
Hey. Are you up
for a swim, maybe?

01:09:36.923 --> 01:09:38.423
Well, sure.

01:09:39.425 --> 01:09:41.301
The pool! The pool!

01:09:41.386 --> 01:09:43.428
Can't you think
about anything else?

01:09:43.513 --> 01:09:45.930
If you and Rose would just come with us,
you'd feel differently.

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:48.517
We don't want to feel differently.
We like the way we feel.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.602
She needs it, Bernie.

01:09:51.437 --> 01:09:53.604
We...
We should discuss this later.

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:55.691
There is nothing to discuss!

01:09:55.775 --> 01:09:57.442
Because you're a hardhead, Bernie.

01:09:57.527 --> 01:09:59.278
You're the most frightened man
I ever knew.

01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:01.029
Christ, I don't have to listen
to you.

01:10:01.114 --> 01:10:03.574
If you sit at this table,
you damn well do!

01:10:04.784 --> 01:10:06.869
You think you're in such great shape,
Finley?

01:10:06.953 --> 01:10:10.038
Your marriage is what's
terminally ill now!

01:10:10.123 --> 01:10:12.749
You really
are an old bastard.

01:10:12.834 --> 01:10:15.294
"Old" is right.
I don't want to be young again.

01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:17.754
Your life is a mess because of
the fountain of youth!

01:10:17.839 --> 01:10:19.548
I don't care how healthy
you think you are!

01:10:19.632 --> 01:10:20.591
Sit down!

01:10:20.675 --> 01:10:22.885
We don't want any part
of that goddamn pool house!

01:10:22.969 --> 01:10:25.971
You can keep the goddamn
fountain of youth!

01:10:26.598 --> 01:10:29.182
No wonder your wife
has no use for you.

01:10:29.267 --> 01:10:30.475
I'm gonna kill
that son of a bitch!

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.227
Joe! Joe!

01:10:32.312 --> 01:10:33.645
Hey!

01:10:42.155 --> 01:10:44.615
Joe! Don't! Joe! Joe!

01:10:44.699 --> 01:10:46.116
Joe!

01:10:50.121 --> 01:10:52.414
It's next door, isn't it?

01:10:52.498 --> 01:10:54.374
It's in that pool
over there, right?

01:10:55.877 --> 01:10:59.004
Get to that pool!
Get out of the way!

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:51.139
What is...

01:11:51.224 --> 01:11:53.392
Oh, my God.
What do we do?

01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:54.601
Ben?

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:57.646
Please, out of the pool.

01:11:57.730 --> 01:11:59.106
Come on, come on!
Everybody out!

01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:06.196
Come on!
Get out of there!

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.824
We have no
business being here!

01:12:11.119 --> 01:12:13.787
Come on!
Out of the water! Get out!

01:12:13.871 --> 01:12:16.456
You don't understand.
We're trespassing.

01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:20.127
Stop! Everybody out!

01:12:21.212 --> 01:12:24.756
You have no right to be here.
You are trespassing here.

01:12:29.429 --> 01:12:31.847
Put down the cocoon.

01:12:31.931 --> 01:12:34.474
I said put down that cocoon!

01:12:34.559 --> 01:12:37.561
Put it down. Put it down.

01:12:38.271 --> 01:12:40.105
I'm calling the police.

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:42.816
Get out!
All of you, get out!

01:14:22.792 --> 01:14:26.294
All this time to
energize the pool.

01:14:26.379 --> 01:14:29.965
Now the life force is completely
drained from the water.

01:14:33.386 --> 01:14:36.513
I'm not gonna be able
to bring them back.

01:14:48.818 --> 01:14:50.735
When Max saw me in that sweater

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:55.157
with the mouton collar
and the ivory buttons,

01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:59.661
he said, "Rose, where the hell
did you get that sweater?"

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:04.082
I stayed mum,

01:15:05.251 --> 01:15:07.752
because I knew you stole it.

01:15:10.131 --> 01:15:12.591
But you stole it for me.

01:15:14.302 --> 01:15:17.387
Max never stole
anything for me,

01:15:18.264 --> 01:15:22.142
and never made anything
as beautiful as that mouton collar.

01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:29.858
Max couldn't do
anything with his hands,

01:15:29.942 --> 01:15:32.611
except when they were all over me.

01:15:35.239 --> 01:15:39.284
And you wouldn't even
kiss my cheek without asking.

01:15:42.455 --> 01:15:47.834
Dumping Max was the smartest move
I ever made.

01:15:55.134 --> 01:15:57.260
Bernie.

01:16:00.598 --> 01:16:04.643
Time for your medicine.
I'll get it.

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:27.123
Here you are.

01:16:28.668 --> 01:16:30.085
Rose.

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:35.507
Rose? Are you asleep?

01:16:37.677 --> 01:16:38.969
Rose.

01:16:44.517 --> 01:16:46.518
Rose?

01:16:48.062 --> 01:16:50.063
Rose.

01:16:58.489 --> 01:16:59.864
Rose.

01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:06.204
Rose.

01:17:08.708 --> 01:17:10.709
I'm so sorry.

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:08.558
Can you help me?

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:13.271
I have to do something for her.
She... She...

01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:18.193
The pool doesn't work anymore.

01:18:18.277 --> 01:18:19.694
It's too late.

01:18:19.779 --> 01:18:22.405
I'll give you
everything I've got.

01:18:25.993 --> 01:18:27.994
I'm sorry, Bernie.

01:18:29.789 --> 01:18:32.832
I wish I could help you.
It's just too late.

01:18:38.964 --> 01:18:40.465
Rosie.

01:18:43.052 --> 01:18:44.761
Rosie.

01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:47.907
Hello, Ben.
Walter.

01:19:48.701 --> 01:19:51.828
I thought maybe you guys had got
the hell out of here already

01:19:51.912 --> 01:19:53.788
after what happened today.

01:19:53.873 --> 01:19:56.624
I came by to tell you
I'm sorry, Walter.

01:19:56.709 --> 01:20:00.587
I... I know we let you down,
and I'm really sorry.

01:20:13.225 --> 01:20:17.103
I had never
experienced the pain

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:23.610
and the grief associated with
death before.

01:20:23.694 --> 01:20:28.239
I've never had anyone
close to me who died.

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.707
Walter,
these things out here,

01:20:38.584 --> 01:20:41.961
can you take them back with you
on that spaceship?

01:20:43.339 --> 01:20:46.132
No. They would never
survive the flight.

01:20:47.218 --> 01:20:50.220
Well, can you put them
back in the ocean?

01:20:52.431 --> 01:20:54.599
Two are gone now.

01:20:57.269 --> 01:20:59.604
Two of my friends are gone.

01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:05.193
We don't have the time to get
them all back into the ocean.

01:21:05.277 --> 01:21:08.196
We must leave this place
tomorrow.

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:11.491
What if we do it tonight?
We'll help you.

01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:16.120
Come on!
Bring that one around here, okay?

01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:18.039
Alma, let me give
you a hand with that.

01:21:18.123 --> 01:21:19.082
There are a lot more.

01:21:19.166 --> 01:21:21.125
Lay this one down outside
and come right back.

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:22.710
Okay. Got it?

01:21:22.795 --> 01:21:24.712
I can't do this alone!

01:21:24.797 --> 01:21:26.256
Hey, somebody give me a hand.

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:28.341
Set it over there.

01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:31.553
Okay.

01:21:31.637 --> 01:21:33.596
Come on! Let's go.
Let's get a hold of this!

01:21:33.681 --> 01:21:35.848
Our base was sinking.

01:21:35.933 --> 01:21:40.144
Time to prepare a passage
for all of us was gone.

01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:45.441
These 20 chose to stay behind so
the rest of us could leave safely.

01:21:47.987 --> 01:21:51.322
They survived here in the ocean
for 10,000 years.

01:21:52.324 --> 01:21:54.576
They can survive again.

01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:56.494
Okay?
Yeah.

01:21:57.955 --> 01:21:58.955
How you guys doing?

01:21:59.039 --> 01:22:00.999
Okay.

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:02.083
You okay?

01:22:02.167 --> 01:22:03.459
Yeah, I'm fine. Fine.

01:22:03.544 --> 01:22:04.752
I've been diving.
It's all right.

01:22:04.837 --> 01:22:06.212
You have?

01:24:25.644 --> 01:24:27.478
I want you all
to consider very carefully

01:24:27.563 --> 01:24:30.606
what I'm about to
suggest to you.

01:24:32.151 --> 01:24:35.486
You and your friends seem
to want what we've got.

01:24:36.989 --> 01:24:40.908
Well, we have room for you.

01:24:42.828 --> 01:24:47.123
We have room for you and about
30 more of your friends.

01:24:47.207 --> 01:24:50.668
You would be students,
of course, but...

01:24:51.837 --> 01:24:54.005
But you'd also be teachers.

01:24:55.674 --> 01:24:58.760
And the new civilizations
that we'll be traveling to

01:24:58.844 --> 01:25:01.846
will be unlike anything
you've ever known.

01:25:04.141 --> 01:25:06.142
But I promise you

01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:10.980
you will all lead
productive lives.

01:25:11.064 --> 01:25:12.774
Forever?

01:25:12.858 --> 01:25:14.817
We don't know
what "forever" means.

01:25:35.756 --> 01:25:39.217
I got a couple of things I...

01:25:41.303 --> 01:25:43.888
I need to talk about with you.

01:25:43.972 --> 01:25:45.056
Yeah?

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:46.557
Yeah.

01:25:50.062 --> 01:25:53.731
I guess me and your grandma
are going away, David.

01:25:54.817 --> 01:25:56.818
Where to?

01:25:56.902 --> 01:26:00.488
Well, that's not important.
What's important is that

01:26:04.076 --> 01:26:09.163
when we get where we're going,
we'll never be sick,

01:26:10.666 --> 01:26:13.835
we won't get any older
and we won't ever die.

01:26:19.716 --> 01:26:21.175
You're joking me, right?

01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:22.426
No.

01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:24.637
No.

01:26:26.098 --> 01:26:29.183
Would I be able to
visit you and Grandma?

01:26:29.643 --> 01:26:32.228
No.

01:26:33.063 --> 01:26:35.273
And we wouldn't be able
to visit you, either.

01:26:35.357 --> 01:26:38.150
And that kind of bothers me.

01:26:38.235 --> 01:26:40.444
I'd never see you again?

01:26:44.658 --> 01:26:45.741
No.

01:26:47.244 --> 01:26:50.371
When would you go, if you did?

01:26:50.455 --> 01:26:53.124
Soon, my boy. Soon.

01:26:54.376 --> 01:26:56.586
And do you know where?

01:26:56.670 --> 01:26:57.795
Where?

01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:59.213
Look up.

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:04.719
Outer space, my lad.

01:27:04.803 --> 01:27:06.596
Outer space.

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:09.432
Who's gonna take
you to outer space?

01:27:09.516 --> 01:27:11.517
It don't matter.

01:27:13.604 --> 01:27:16.564
You wouldn't believe me if I told you,
and I can't tell your mother,

01:27:16.648 --> 01:27:20.735
because she'd then know her
old man had snapped his cap.

01:27:22.487 --> 01:27:25.907
I wonder if they'll
have fishing holes there.

01:27:27.993 --> 01:27:31.120
There's some things they won't have.
They won't have grandsons,

01:27:31.204 --> 01:27:35.416
and they won't
have baseball games,

01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:36.918
and they won't
have hot dogs,

01:27:37.002 --> 01:27:40.421
and they won't have that kind of stuff.
And...

01:27:43.008 --> 01:27:44.800
I'm gonna miss them.

01:27:46.345 --> 01:27:48.679
All right.
Cast it out there.

01:28:00.233 --> 01:28:02.526
I wish we'd get a bite.

01:28:02.653 --> 01:28:05.863
If I could catch one
more great, big fish...

01:28:11.119 --> 01:28:14.747
You know how much
we love you, don't you?

01:28:14.831 --> 01:28:17.166
Of course I do.

01:28:17.250 --> 01:28:19.335
I just don't want you
to forget how much we care

01:28:19.419 --> 01:28:22.380
no matter what we say or do.

01:28:23.090 --> 01:28:24.882
Of course.

01:28:45.737 --> 01:28:47.196
Bye, Grandpa.

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:49.156
Goodbye, little man.

01:28:50.075 --> 01:28:51.701
Smile.

01:28:53.495 --> 01:28:55.955
Bye, Dad. Bye, Mom.

01:28:56.039 --> 01:28:59.000
Stop by next
week sometime, okay?

01:29:01.545 --> 01:29:04.255
Be a good boy.
Mind your mom.

01:29:32.242 --> 01:29:34.493
You having second thoughts?

01:29:36.538 --> 01:29:38.164
Yes.

01:29:40.542 --> 01:29:43.252
So you think it's like Bernie says,
we're cheating nature.

01:29:43.336 --> 01:29:44.462
Yes.

01:29:47.632 --> 01:29:50.301
Well, I'll tell you something.

01:29:50.385 --> 01:29:51.802
The way nature's
been treating us,

01:29:51.887 --> 01:29:54.722
I don't mind
cheating her a little.

01:30:09.154 --> 01:30:11.155
You'll be closing your account
then, Mr. Selwyn?

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:12.281
Yes, I will.

01:30:12.365 --> 01:30:13.866
All in $100 bills?

01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:15.076
Uh-huh.

01:30:15.911 --> 01:30:17.912
Here you go.

01:30:19.873 --> 01:30:21.624
This is for you.

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:23.667
Sir!

01:30:26.671 --> 01:30:30.216
Here. Have fun,
have fun, my friends! Have fun!

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:32.676
Here. Divide it up, girls!
Divide it up! Divide it up!

01:30:33.970 --> 01:30:36.263
There you are.
There you are.

01:30:36.348 --> 01:30:37.890
Racing with the moon

01:30:37.974 --> 01:30:40.518
Hey! Enjoy, enjoy!

01:30:40.602 --> 01:30:43.062
Sailing through
the midnight sun

01:31:02.707 --> 01:31:05.042
He can come in
for a minute.

01:31:11.174 --> 01:31:12.716
Hi.

01:31:20.183 --> 01:31:24.895
They say if we go with them,
we'll live forever.

01:31:30.235 --> 01:31:31.819
And that's good.

01:31:32.571 --> 01:31:36.198
It's probably gonna take you
an eternity to forgive me.

01:31:43.331 --> 01:31:45.082
I'm sorry, Alma.

01:31:47.252 --> 01:31:50.671
I guess I've been ridiculous.
I am sorry.

01:31:51.923 --> 01:31:53.841
I love you.

01:31:55.093 --> 01:31:57.720
You're my whole life.

01:32:01.016 --> 01:32:02.933
I want to go.

01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:08.939
But if it's a choice of only
six more months here with you,

01:32:09.983 --> 01:32:11.692
or living forever
all by myself,

01:32:11.776 --> 01:32:15.196
well, I'll take the six more
months here with you.

01:32:18.116 --> 01:32:20.659
I don't want
to live forever

01:32:22.287 --> 01:32:24.788
if you're not
gonna be with me.

01:32:38.637 --> 01:32:40.971
So, you definitely
trust them?

01:32:41.056 --> 01:32:42.348
We trust them.

01:32:42.432 --> 01:32:45.559
Men should be explorers,
no matter how old they are.

01:32:45.644 --> 01:32:48.896
I don't know about anybody else,
but I'm going.

01:32:55.028 --> 01:32:58.072
Why the hell not?
We're in.

01:32:58.990 --> 01:33:00.616
Are you nervous?

01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:02.326
Me? No.

01:33:02.869 --> 01:33:05.663
You're sure you
want to do this?

01:33:05.747 --> 01:33:10.292
Once I make a decision,
Arthur, I never turn back.

01:33:10.377 --> 01:33:12.920
This is a big one.

01:33:13.004 --> 01:33:14.255
I know.

01:33:32.565 --> 01:33:35.567
Yeah, it's gonna be 72
and clear tonight,

01:33:35.652 --> 01:33:37.987
a great night to see
that total lunar eclipse.

01:33:38.071 --> 01:33:39.321
Check it out.

01:33:39.406 --> 01:33:41.407
But don't get
weird on me, people.

01:33:52.294 --> 01:33:53.460
Let's go. Let's go.

01:33:53.545 --> 01:33:54.795
Sure.

01:33:59.551 --> 01:34:02.386
Quick.
Get me a glass of water.

01:34:03.638 --> 01:34:05.681
Look out.

01:34:11.104 --> 01:34:13.314
Don't do that!

01:34:13.898 --> 01:34:15.733
What is the meaning of this?

01:34:24.617 --> 01:34:28.537
David? Staying up
for the eclipse?

01:34:31.249 --> 01:34:33.876
You don't seem
too enthusiastic.

01:34:36.588 --> 01:34:39.423
Did you and Grandpa
have a fight today?

01:34:40.467 --> 01:34:42.009
No.

01:34:42.093 --> 01:34:44.011
What did he say to you?

01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:50.225
David, I'm very worried
about Grandpa and Grandma.

01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:53.020
What did he say to you?

01:34:53.813 --> 01:34:56.023
I can't tell you.

01:34:56.107 --> 01:34:58.108
They're my parents, David.

01:34:58.193 --> 01:35:00.944
You've got to tell me
what he said to you.

01:35:08.328 --> 01:35:10.621
He made me promise.

01:35:44.406 --> 01:35:46.281
Mom? Dad?

01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:49.159
Mom? Dad?

01:35:54.416 --> 01:35:57.334
Hey, Bernie. Come on.

01:35:59.003 --> 01:36:02.131
You're coming with us, Bernie?

01:36:05.009 --> 01:36:08.887
No. I came to say goodbye.

01:36:08.972 --> 01:36:13.142
I just wanted to tell you I hope
you find what you're looking for.

01:36:14.352 --> 01:36:18.105
Rose is gone, Bernie.
Why stay?

01:36:22.527 --> 01:36:24.570
This is my home.

01:36:25.697 --> 01:36:28.031
This is where I belong.

01:36:29.534 --> 01:36:31.660
Come on. Go with us.

01:36:48.261 --> 01:36:50.012
Bye, Bernie.

01:36:54.392 --> 01:36:56.143
Bye, Bernie.

01:36:56.227 --> 01:36:57.269
Bye.

01:36:57.353 --> 01:36:58.729
I'm gonna miss you.

01:37:13.703 --> 01:37:15.245
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

01:37:16.456 --> 01:37:18.832
Come on. God...

01:37:21.836 --> 01:37:25.088
Only when I need it, right?
Only when I need it.

01:37:27.050 --> 01:37:28.675
Jesus...

01:37:30.261 --> 01:37:31.887
I know something is wrong.

01:37:31.971 --> 01:37:33.514
They're probably out dancing.

01:37:33.598 --> 01:37:36.058
Those folks love to dance.

01:37:36.768 --> 01:37:39.520
Could we talk to
one of their friends?

01:37:40.813 --> 01:37:42.898
We'll go see Pops.

01:37:43.983 --> 01:37:45.943
Will that satisfy you?

01:37:47.028 --> 01:37:48.445
Pops.

01:37:49.364 --> 01:37:50.864
Pops.

01:37:51.783 --> 01:37:54.576
Got a little game of
20 questions for you.

01:37:54.661 --> 01:37:56.370
Pops!

01:37:58.998 --> 01:38:00.624
Shit!

01:38:02.126 --> 01:38:03.669
Hello?

01:38:15.348 --> 01:38:18.016
I don't know
what's going on here.

01:38:20.353 --> 01:38:21.603
Jack, we'd better
take a look down below.

01:38:21.688 --> 01:38:22.729
What?

01:38:22.814 --> 01:38:23.897
We'd better take
a look down below.

01:38:23.982 --> 01:38:26.066
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

01:38:29.028 --> 01:38:31.238
Make sure you get the feed line.
Okay? 'Cause it's gotta be...

01:38:31.322 --> 01:38:33.282
You got it. Good.

01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:38.912
The injector. We've got to make
the injector... It's got...

01:38:38.997 --> 01:38:41.707
You got that, too?
Good. Make sure...

01:38:42.208 --> 01:38:43.667
You go house to house.

01:38:43.751 --> 01:38:46.587
Check the bus stations
and the airports.

01:38:46.671 --> 01:38:48.589
This is a serious
situation we got here.

01:38:48.673 --> 01:38:50.716
The owner of the facility is
on his way from West Palm,

01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:52.134
and he's not happy at all.

01:38:52.218 --> 01:38:55.554
Why don't you start by taking a
good look around the grounds first?

01:38:55.638 --> 01:38:56.638
Okay, gentlemen?

01:38:56.723 --> 01:38:58.223
Okay. Right this way.

01:38:58.308 --> 01:39:00.684
Better advise the commander.

01:39:03.146 --> 01:39:04.438
Don't worry, miss.

01:39:04.522 --> 01:39:07.149
We'll help you find
your father and mother.

01:39:07.233 --> 01:39:08.650
It's right over here.

01:39:08.735 --> 01:39:11.403
We're in deep shit.
You know that?

01:39:29.797 --> 01:39:32.841
David! David!

01:39:32.925 --> 01:39:35.010
Back this way.

01:39:41.392 --> 01:39:42.809
Hey, hey. Whoa!

01:39:51.444 --> 01:39:54.279
In case you're wondering...
Silly Putty.

01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:08.043
Cast off those lines.

01:40:15.802 --> 01:40:20.097
Grandpa, wait for me!
I want to go, too!

01:40:25.103 --> 01:40:26.353
Grandpa!

01:40:26.437 --> 01:40:28.021
What are you doing here?

01:40:28.106 --> 01:40:29.856
Are you all right?
Yeah.

01:40:29.941 --> 01:40:31.566
My gosh.

01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:37.823
David!

01:40:37.907 --> 01:40:39.741
A boat just left the dock.
David!

01:40:39.826 --> 01:40:42.703
A lot of old people aboard,
a kid, some in wheelchairs.

01:40:42.787 --> 01:40:43.870
David!

01:40:43.955 --> 01:40:48.250
We better move on this thing now.
I don't like the looks of it.

01:40:48.334 --> 01:40:50.127
You can't go.

01:40:51.462 --> 01:40:54.673
Only your grandmother
and me from this outfit.

01:41:40.011 --> 01:41:41.344
This is Air 21.

01:41:41.429 --> 01:41:43.138
I think I got them below me.

01:41:43.222 --> 01:41:44.931
Want me to swoop them? Over.

01:41:45.016 --> 01:41:47.684
Roger, Air 21.
You are clear.

01:42:31.437 --> 01:42:34.648
Manta III, this is not a request.
This is an order.

01:42:34.732 --> 01:42:38.902
You are endangering the lives of
your passengers. Cut your engines.

01:42:38.986 --> 01:42:42.447
We are coming alongside
to board your vessel.

01:42:42.532 --> 01:42:45.575
Jack. Don't let them
board us.

01:42:46.244 --> 01:42:47.410
Nobody's gonna
board this boat.

01:42:47.495 --> 01:42:50.247
You just get
your friends here.

01:43:16.065 --> 01:43:18.608
Captain, cut your engines.

01:43:19.277 --> 01:43:23.697
Captain, this is Lieutenant Spark
of the St. Petersburg police.

01:43:23.781 --> 01:43:25.407
You have senior citizens aboard

01:43:25.491 --> 01:43:28.201
who are in no condition
to be out here.

01:43:28.286 --> 01:43:31.872
You have a minor aboard without
proper authority from his mother.

01:43:31.956 --> 01:43:33.665
We want to question you.

01:43:33.749 --> 01:43:36.167
Please, cut your engines now.

01:43:37.044 --> 01:43:40.213
We are coming alongside
to board your vessel.

01:43:40.298 --> 01:43:42.966
Stand by to be boarded.

01:43:43.968 --> 01:43:45.427
David's mother wants him to

01:43:45.511 --> 01:43:47.721
come into the police boat
with her.

01:43:47.805 --> 01:43:50.682
David! Come on. Please.

01:43:50.766 --> 01:43:53.268
Mom and Dad,
where are you going?

01:43:59.066 --> 01:44:01.651
David! You come back here!

01:44:05.323 --> 01:44:06.448
David!

01:44:06.532 --> 01:44:08.283
Bring it around.

01:44:08.367 --> 01:44:11.620
Cut your engines.
Cut your engines and come about.

01:44:11.704 --> 01:44:12.871
Man overboard.

01:44:12.955 --> 01:44:14.623
Man overboard, gentlemen.

01:44:17.043 --> 01:44:18.084
You all right?

01:44:18.169 --> 01:44:19.210
I'm okay!

01:44:19.295 --> 01:44:22.172
I'm not scared!
Get going!

01:44:24.592 --> 01:44:25.884
Let's go!

01:44:47.531 --> 01:44:49.366
David.

01:45:03.339 --> 01:45:05.131
Maintain a visual on the Manta.

01:45:05.216 --> 01:45:06.967
These people must be nuts.

01:45:07.051 --> 01:45:10.053
We're gonna have to
pursue and intercept.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.208
We just went into fog, Chris.

01:46:22.293 --> 01:46:24.252
Rolling out.
Re-check speed selectors.

01:46:24.336 --> 01:46:25.378
Full forward. Wheels up.

01:46:25.463 --> 01:46:26.629
Speed selectors,
re-check, full forward.

01:46:30.926 --> 01:46:33.553
Where the hell
did this come from?

01:46:33.637 --> 01:46:36.473
I don't know.
I can't see a damn thing.

01:46:37.349 --> 01:46:39.184
I've never seen it
roll in so fast.

01:46:40.186 --> 01:46:42.145
My God!

01:46:48.986 --> 01:46:50.987
We get no reading on radar.
Over.

01:46:51.072 --> 01:46:53.990
14X3, we copy.
Have zero visibility.

01:46:54.075 --> 01:46:55.950
We're gonna run into each other.
Go ahead.

01:46:56.035 --> 01:46:58.161
Roger.
Let's shut them down. Over.

01:47:54.301 --> 01:47:56.928
This should more than cover
the cost of the boat.

01:47:57.012 --> 01:47:58.138
I didn't...

01:47:58.222 --> 01:48:02.934
I want to thank you for being
a fine guide and a good friend.

01:48:03.018 --> 01:48:04.519
All right.

01:48:06.355 --> 01:48:08.773
Now, you drive careful,
Walter.

01:48:11.110 --> 01:48:12.902
See you, Walter.

01:48:25.416 --> 01:48:28.168
I guess your
ride's here, huh?

01:48:28.252 --> 01:48:31.171
Look, Kitty,
next time you're in town,

01:48:31.255 --> 01:48:32.839
I want you to
look me up, okay?

01:48:32.923 --> 01:48:36.134
Don't worry, Jack.
You'll know when I'm around.

01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:40.180
You don't know how close I came
to buying a ticket.

01:49:01.827 --> 01:49:02.827
You'd better go.

01:49:02.912 --> 01:49:04.787
Okay. I'm gonna
miss you, Kitty.

01:49:04.872 --> 01:49:06.831
I'm really gonna miss you.

01:49:10.878 --> 01:49:13.129
May the force be with you!

01:51:00.696 --> 01:51:04.407
There can never be an accounting,
in human terms,

01:51:04.491 --> 01:51:07.535
for the tragedy at sea
which has taken the lives

01:51:07.619 --> 01:51:10.872
of these men and women
in what should have been

01:51:10.956 --> 01:51:14.876
the beautiful and peaceful sunset
of their lives.

01:51:16.170 --> 01:51:18.171
Do not fear.

01:51:18.255 --> 01:51:21.215
Your loved ones
are in safekeeping.

01:51:22.009 --> 01:51:26.012
They have moved on to a higher
expression of life,

01:51:26.096 --> 01:51:31.100
not life as we know it,
but in the spirit everlasting.

01:51:31.185 --> 01:51:37.106
Our loved ones are in good hands,
for now and forevermore.

01:51:38.275 --> 01:51:42.612
Join with me now in a moment
of silent prayer.
