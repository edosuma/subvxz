WEBVTT

00:35.785 --> 00:38.746
<i>Yep, that's me. Kronk.</i>

00:38.830 --> 00:41.165
<i>Wait. Where did I go?</i>

00:41.207 --> 00:42.624
<i>Right, there I am.</i>

00:42.709 --> 00:45.127
<i>Covered in cheese like a human pizza.</i>

00:45.211 --> 00:47.004
<i>My life was fine until today.</i>

00:47.047 --> 00:50.215
<i>But now I'm doomed. Doomed!</i>

00:51.217 --> 00:52.760
<i>You know, it wasn't always like this.</i>

00:52.844 --> 00:56.180
<i>I helped save the emperor's life.</i>
<i>Found a rewarding career.</i>

00:56.222 --> 00:57.723
<i>Next slide!</i>

00:57.766 --> 01:00.059
<i>I even made some great new friends.</i>

01:00.977 --> 01:03.896
<i>But look at me now!</i>
<i>Hiding out like a frightened kid</i>

01:03.980 --> 01:05.773
<i>who needs a hug from his teddy bear.</i>

01:05.857 --> 01:08.567
<i>The little yellow one</i>
<i>with the button nose.</i>

01:08.610 --> 01:11.737
<i>If only I could turn back the clock.</i>

01:11.821 --> 01:14.740
<i>Back to a time</i>
<i>when I had a spring in my step</i>

01:14.783 --> 01:17.159
<i>and a smile in my heart.</i>

01:17.786 --> 01:20.579
<i>A time I like to think of as...</i>

01:59.119 --> 02:00.619
<i>Come on!</i>

02:03.957 --> 02:05.958
<i>That's what I'm talking about</i>

02:07.794 --> 02:09.086
<i>Look out! Here it comes!</i>

02:09.963 --> 02:11.630
<i>See him walkin' down the street</i>

02:11.714 --> 02:13.841
<i>With a merry gleam in his eye</i>

02:13.925 --> 02:17.136
<i>He's loved by everyone in this town</i>

02:17.220 --> 02:18.262
<i>He's loved by this town</i>

02:18.304 --> 02:22.099
<i>To look at him now you'd never know</i>
<i>He was once the kind of guy</i>

02:22.142 --> 02:25.060
<i>Who tried to bring an empire down</i>

02:25.145 --> 02:26.478
<i>An empire down</i>

02:26.563 --> 02:30.649
<i>He lost his groove, he lost his way</i>
<i>When he fell in with a woman</i>

02:30.733 --> 02:34.319
<i>Who wanted to take over the world</i>

02:34.404 --> 02:36.655
<i>But then he did a full 180</i>

02:36.698 --> 02:38.824
<i>Said vamoose to the shady lady</i>

02:38.867 --> 02:42.327
<i>Now he'll teach your kid</i>
<i>to talk like a squirrel</i>

02:44.080 --> 02:48.959
<i>And though he spreads such joy</i>
<i>everywhere he goes</i>

02:49.002 --> 02:51.670
<i>Looks like this town's fly guy</i>

02:51.713 --> 02:54.548
<i>Will be the last to know</i>

02:54.632 --> 02:56.925
<i>There is nothing to prove</i>

02:57.010 --> 03:01.180
<i>Don't have to approve</i>
<i>the way that you move</i>

03:01.222 --> 03:04.808
<i>Don't have to be smart</i>
<i>or be rich or be smooth</i>

03:04.851 --> 03:09.021
<i>Don't have to make art</i>
<i>that could hang in the Louvre</i>

03:09.105 --> 03:11.315
<i>If you just go with your heart</i>

03:11.357 --> 03:14.902
<i>-Then you'll be true to your groove</i>
<i>-True to your groove</i>

03:23.369 --> 03:25.662
<i>Yeah, you should be true to your</i>

03:25.705 --> 03:28.373
<i>You should be true to your groove</i>

03:31.419 --> 03:34.546
<i>So right about now</i>
<i>you're probably wondering,</i>

03:34.631 --> 03:36.465
<i>"Hey, where's that emperor guy?"</i>

03:37.383 --> 03:39.051
Wella, wella, boom baby!

03:39.135 --> 03:42.846
Emperor Kuzco here,
coming at you live from the palace.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.181
Hail Kuzco!

03:44.224 --> 03:46.725
No, please, don't grovel. I'd feel stupid.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.518
I'm not that kind of guy anymore.

03:48.561 --> 03:51.480
I'm nice now.
Didn't you see the first movie?

03:52.398 --> 03:54.107
A 50-foot me!

03:54.192 --> 03:57.277
I love that movie,
'cause it's all about me.

03:59.155 --> 04:03.533
But right now it's Kronk's turn
to be in the limelight.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.577
Let me put this as simply as I can.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.704
This one's his movie.

04:07.747 --> 04:10.082
Not my movie. His movie.

04:10.166 --> 04:12.751
Not mine. His, not mine.

04:12.835 --> 04:14.836
His. Not mine. You got it?

04:14.921 --> 04:17.005
Even the little ones? Okay.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.674
I'll be back to check on you later.

04:18.758 --> 04:22.135
Have some popcorn,
a little sippy-sip of your sip stuff.

04:22.220 --> 04:25.264
Places, please. Action!

04:28.393 --> 04:29.643
Ordering!

04:29.727 --> 04:33.272
Waffle platter, extra butter,
two honey-glazed pill bugs

04:33.356 --> 04:36.108
and a chocolate sundae,
hold the cherry.

04:36.150 --> 04:37.985
One diet plate. Got it.

04:38.069 --> 04:41.697
<i>Yeah, it was shaping up</i>
<i>to be another perfect day.</i>

04:41.781 --> 04:45.450
<i>The orders were flying, the joint</i>
<i>was jumping, grease was popping...</i>

04:45.868 --> 04:47.577
<i>And everybody knew my name.</i>

04:47.620 --> 04:49.121
Kronk!

04:49.163 --> 04:51.290
<i>Oh, yeah, I was living the dream.</i>

04:51.332 --> 04:53.333
Hey, Kronk! How about some grub?

04:53.418 --> 04:55.127
-Pacha!
-Hey, Kronk!

04:55.211 --> 04:56.420
Tipo. Chaca.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.550
Put her there, Junior Chipmunks.

05:02.802 --> 05:04.303
Nice handshake, Chippers!

05:04.387 --> 05:07.472
-Someone's been practicing.
-You're too kind.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.933
Pacha, you forgot
your change yesterday.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.476
Hey, thanks, Kronk!

05:11.519 --> 05:14.062
Well, what's right is right. Otherwise...

05:14.147 --> 05:16.815
-It'd be wrong!
-Right.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.276
Boy, the place is packed.

05:19.319 --> 05:22.529
Yeah. Never had this many friends
when I was an evil henchman.

05:22.613 --> 05:25.032
And look at you now, chef at Mudka's.

05:25.116 --> 05:27.409
And head delivery boy!

05:27.493 --> 05:31.705
<i>Delivery Boy logo by permission</i>
<i>of Delivery Boy Local 8675309.</i>

05:31.789 --> 05:35.334
-I get my one-year pin next week.
-That calls for a celebration!

05:35.376 --> 05:37.169
A toast to Kronk!

05:37.253 --> 05:39.171
May you be this happy

05:39.255 --> 05:40.630
till the day you die!

05:49.265 --> 05:51.808
I've come to deliver
this urgent llamagram.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.645
Llamagram. Thank you.

05:58.274 --> 05:59.608
Everything okay, buddy?

06:03.988 --> 06:07.991
Are you kidding? It's just your
run-of-the-mill urgent llamagram.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.583
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

06:16.667 --> 06:20.045
I know. I'll tunnel out of here with
a spoon, escape through the sewers

06:20.129 --> 06:23.173
and live as a quiet
but lonely shepherdess named Maria.

06:24.717 --> 06:25.717
That'll work.

06:26.969 --> 06:29.679
We're out of spoons!
That's it. I'm done for.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.224
Chin up, big guy. I'm here for you.

06:32.308 --> 06:34.684
You! This is all your fault! You...

06:35.478 --> 06:37.646
You're the one who
got me into this mess!

06:37.730 --> 06:40.524
If you'd listened,
you could have had everything.

06:40.566 --> 06:43.235
But no. You had to listen
to Ms. Goody Two-Wings.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.737
Mr. Goody Two-Wings.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.823
Yeah, big talk
coming from a guy in a dress.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.367
-I told you, it's a robe.
-And those are pearls.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.828
Fellas! You're not helping.

06:53.454 --> 06:55.956
Now where was I? Oh, yeah.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.041
Doomed!

06:58.084 --> 07:00.961
-What's with you?
-It's my father.

07:01.045 --> 07:03.338
He's... He's...

07:03.423 --> 07:04.923
Coming for a visit.

07:06.092 --> 07:09.594
"Can't wait to meet your wife and kids
and see your big house on the hill.

07:09.679 --> 07:13.098
"Cordially, your father, Papi."

07:13.141 --> 07:14.349
So?

07:14.434 --> 07:18.770
So Papi said I have to have all those
things if I'm ever gonna be a success.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.356
And I once had them, but I lost them!

07:22.692 --> 07:24.526
-So?
-I never told him that part.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.945
Big whoop. Tell him the truth.

07:27.029 --> 07:30.073
What? Tell him the truth? Are you nuts?

07:30.116 --> 07:33.326
You don't let a guy like Papi down,
or you'll get one of these.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.454
The Cold Shoulder,
the Frenzied Eyebrow,

07:35.538 --> 07:38.582
the Grimace of Doom,
the Sneer of Despair,

07:38.624 --> 07:40.500
the Crippling Wince of Guilt,

07:40.585 --> 07:42.627
the Scowl of Impending Wrath,

07:42.670 --> 07:44.421
and worst of all,

07:44.464 --> 07:47.924
the Nostril Flare of Total Rejection.

07:48.259 --> 07:51.553
Total rejection. Right, right.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.930
I remember it well. Too well.

07:59.687 --> 08:01.771
<i>You see, I was always...</i>

08:01.814 --> 08:03.482
<i>Different growing up.</i>

08:17.330 --> 08:18.997
<i>Papi didn't approve.</i>

08:19.957 --> 08:23.502
<i>He said if I didn't get serious,</i>
<i>I'd never amount to anything.</i>

08:25.338 --> 08:28.006
<i>But nothing I ever did</i>
<i>was good enough for him.</i>

08:55.535 --> 08:59.538
<i>All I ever wanted was a thumbs up</i>

08:59.622 --> 09:01.581
<i>from Papi.</i>

09:01.874 --> 09:03.875
And I was so close.

09:05.294 --> 09:08.296
I once had a beautiful house on a hill.

09:09.090 --> 09:11.216
Papi woulda loved it.

09:11.300 --> 09:13.718
That house was a dream come true.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.721
Are you gonna tell me your life story,

09:16.764 --> 09:19.349
or are we gonna get back
to running a restaurant?

09:19.809 --> 09:22.102
You're right. Priorities.

09:23.938 --> 09:26.898
Get comfortable.
I've got a lot to get off my chest.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.025
Oy! I had to ask.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.069
My nightmare began
on a day like any other.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.739
<i>So, technically, I guess</i>
<i>that would be a "daymare."</i>

09:34.824 --> 09:36.241
<i>But I digress.</i>

09:36.325 --> 09:40.078
<i>It was lunchtime, and I was making</i>
<i>my usual deliveries around town.</i>

09:40.121 --> 09:42.080
<i>I always saved the best stop for last,</i>

09:42.164 --> 09:46.126
<i>to see my dear old friends at the</i>
<i>Flickering Embers Home for Seniors.</i>

09:46.210 --> 09:48.545
<i>A happier group of folks</i>
<i>you'd never hope to meet.</i>

09:48.588 --> 09:53.341
<i>A perfect example of how</i>
<i>to grow old with grace and dignity.</i>

09:53.509 --> 09:55.760
Does this look like a rash to you?

09:55.803 --> 09:58.096
Has anybody seen my teeth?

09:58.598 --> 10:00.765
Oy! My aching knee.

10:01.892 --> 10:04.561
I sure wish there
was some way to stop getting old.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.439
If only they could put youth in a bottle.

10:07.481 --> 10:09.649
I'd pay anything for that.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.401
Again with the youth potion.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.863
How many times do I have to tell you,
there's no such thing!

10:14.947 --> 10:16.906
-But if there were...
-But there's not!

10:16.949 --> 10:18.783
-I said "if"!
-If, schmiff!

10:18.868 --> 10:20.327
Okay, you two lovebirds.

10:20.411 --> 10:23.413
I don't have any youth potion,
but I did bring you lunch.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.373
-Hello, Kronk!
-Hello, Kronk!

10:25.458 --> 10:27.125
-Hiya, Kronk!
-Rudy!

10:27.168 --> 10:29.294
Gimme some stick. What's shaking?

10:29.337 --> 10:30.837
What isn't?

10:30.921 --> 10:33.548
Brought your favorite,
purée of mystery meat.

10:34.759 --> 10:38.637
Now that's a lunch
I can sink my teeth into.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.973
And to complement your meal,
prune juice.

10:43.351 --> 10:46.144
Drink up, everyone! Liquid gold.

10:47.104 --> 10:49.773
How can you drink that stuff?

10:49.815 --> 10:51.733
<i>Kronk says it's good for us.</i>

10:53.319 --> 10:55.487
Good enough for me. Fill her up, Kronk!

10:57.114 --> 11:00.617
-I guess that's everything.
-Aren't you forgetting something?

11:02.328 --> 11:04.829
-No, that's not it.
-Here you go, pal.

11:04.872 --> 11:06.122
From all of us.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.707
Oh, no, Rudy. I couldn't.

11:07.792 --> 11:11.336
We insist! It's for your house fund.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.546
You know. So you can afford that

11:13.631 --> 11:16.800
house on the hill your father
always wanted you to have.

11:16.842 --> 11:20.845
<i>Oh, yeah. And then I could finally</i>
<i>get the big thumbs up from Papi.</i>

11:20.930 --> 11:22.847
Yeah. How's that going?

11:23.349 --> 11:25.433
I'll get there. Someday.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.152
How about fresh pill bug tomorrow?

11:36.195 --> 11:38.446
-All right!
-I'll see you all later.

11:39.865 --> 11:43.243
Oh, boy.
Somebody lose this? Anybody?

11:46.247 --> 11:47.372
That's weird.

11:54.588 --> 11:55.672
Hey!

11:55.715 --> 11:59.342
<i>Little did I know, my life</i>
<i>was about to be changed forever.</i>

11:59.385 --> 12:02.721
<i>If only there'd</i>
<i>been some kind of warning.</i>

12:02.805 --> 12:04.639
<i>A sign.</i>

12:04.724 --> 12:06.349
<i>Anything.</i>

12:08.310 --> 12:11.688
You're a feisty one. Hold still now.

12:25.619 --> 12:28.079
All right.
Where'd you go, you little rascal?

12:28.122 --> 12:31.583
Looking for this?

12:36.547 --> 12:39.007
Hello, Kronk.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.301
Yzma! What are you doing here?

12:41.385 --> 12:44.304
I live here. Ever since
I was thrown out of the palace.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.598
Weird. Never seen you around.

12:46.682 --> 12:49.517
But I've seen you, Kronk.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.603
-You look good.
-You think?

12:51.687 --> 12:54.564
At least you're not a cat anymore.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.357
-Except for that.
-Yes.

12:56.442 --> 13:00.945
An unfortunate side effect
of our last escapade together.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.447
Yeah. Good times.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.325
You drank that potion,
turned you into a cat.

13:05.409 --> 13:08.161
Who would have thought?
It was a pink one like this.

13:08.245 --> 13:09.621
Don't touch the pink one!

13:12.500 --> 13:13.750
It's cough medicine.

13:16.420 --> 13:19.255
Hope you get to feeling better.
I'd love to stay and reminisce, but...

13:19.298 --> 13:22.258
-I've been watching you.
-Yeah.

13:22.843 --> 13:26.471
And I have a proposition for you.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.975
A business proposition.

13:32.394 --> 13:35.855
You see, Kronk,
I'm not the person I once was.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.106
I've changed.

13:37.149 --> 13:39.692
I've turned myself around

13:39.777 --> 13:43.446
and devoted myself to...

13:47.284 --> 13:49.327
Well, that's some turnaround.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.788
I want to help those old geez...

13:51.831 --> 13:54.541
I mean, your friends out there.

13:54.625 --> 13:59.462
Wouldn't you do anything
to ease their suffering, Kronk?

13:59.505 --> 14:02.715
-Of course I would, Yzma.
-Good. Then follow me!

14:05.010 --> 14:06.636
Pull the lever!

14:07.513 --> 14:08.763
This lever?

14:08.848 --> 14:10.473
-I worked out the bugs.
-Just checking.

14:19.483 --> 14:21.401
Wait for it.

14:26.323 --> 14:28.116
This is even better than your last one!

14:31.704 --> 14:34.497
Welcome to my new secret lab.

14:35.124 --> 14:37.709
-Souvenir photo?
-Rats! My eyes are closed.

14:37.751 --> 14:39.544
Follow me!

14:41.589 --> 14:43.214
Looks like someone's been busy.

14:43.257 --> 14:44.757
I've finally done it.

14:44.842 --> 14:47.844
I've created the elixir of life.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.179
The answer to everyone's prayers.

14:50.222 --> 14:51.556
Behold!

14:51.640 --> 14:54.309
The fountain of youth in a bottle!

14:57.062 --> 15:00.023
-Regular and diet.
-What do you call this?

15:00.065 --> 15:03.234
Yzma's Young and Beautiful!

15:03.485 --> 15:04.527
Catchy.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.155
And now that you're here,

15:07.239 --> 15:11.951
I finally have the one person
who can make my plan a success!

15:12.036 --> 15:13.995
And that person would be...

15:14.079 --> 15:16.164
-You.
-Me! I knew that.

15:16.665 --> 15:17.832
Wait. Why me?

15:17.917 --> 15:20.543
Because I'm not exactly what you call

15:20.586 --> 15:22.503
a "people person."

15:22.588 --> 15:24.631
And everyone trusts you.

15:24.715 --> 15:27.550
Those old people will buy
anything you tell them to.

15:27.593 --> 15:30.303
So you want me to sell this to them?

15:30.387 --> 15:34.265
What do you say, Kronk?
Help me to help you to help them?

15:34.350 --> 15:37.101
I can't take money from them.
It wouldn't be right.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.228
Too bad.

15:39.271 --> 15:42.857
Now I guess you'll never get
that great big house on a hill

15:43.275 --> 15:46.361
and the big thumbs up from Papi.

15:47.279 --> 15:48.321
Papi?

15:48.405 --> 15:49.739
Bingo.

15:52.451 --> 15:56.079
<i>He wants to come on up to your house</i>

15:56.789 --> 15:58.623
<i>Have some supper</i>

15:58.707 --> 16:02.126
What will you serve it on, Kronk?
Plastic Tupper?

16:02.169 --> 16:06.881
<i>You don't even own a fixer-upper</i>

16:06.966 --> 16:09.217
<i>Help me to help you to help him</i>

16:09.301 --> 16:10.969
Help you to help me to help who?

16:11.011 --> 16:13.638
I need gold, Kronk!

16:14.348 --> 16:16.474
I mean, you need gold.

16:16.558 --> 16:18.434
<i>So sign your name</i>

16:18.477 --> 16:19.936
<i>On this line</i>

16:19.979 --> 16:21.354
<i>Avoid disaster</i>

16:21.438 --> 16:24.482
"You'll achieve a beautiful connection
with your father."

16:24.525 --> 16:27.151
<i>Just faster</i>
<i>Win Papi's love</i>

16:27.236 --> 16:30.154
<i>With that pile of plaster</i>

16:30.239 --> 16:32.407
<i>Help me to help you to help him</i>

16:32.491 --> 16:33.992
<i>And then you'll hear him say</i>

16:34.034 --> 16:35.660
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

16:35.703 --> 16:37.704
<i>I'm milking the Milky Way</i>

16:37.788 --> 16:40.081
<i>I'm loving this lovely day</i>

16:40.165 --> 16:41.207
<i>And I</i>

16:41.291 --> 16:42.917
<i>Feel like a million</i>

16:43.002 --> 16:44.502
Wow zee wow

16:44.586 --> 16:46.671
<i>This cat is back, and how</i>

16:46.714 --> 16:51.634
<i>I'm taking my big-time bow</i>
<i>when I feel like a million</i>

16:51.677 --> 16:53.845
<i>A million, a million</i>

16:53.929 --> 16:56.431
<i>A million</i>

16:57.516 --> 17:00.518
Yes! Now, sell, sell, sell!

17:02.980 --> 17:04.647
Step right up.

17:04.690 --> 17:08.359
It's finally arrived.
The cure for everything that ails you.

17:08.444 --> 17:11.320
Yzma's Young and Beautiful!

17:14.658 --> 17:16.659
It's a youth potion.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.328
-Here you go.
-Kronk!

17:19.371 --> 17:24.584
Does this stuff really work?

17:29.840 --> 17:31.049
Good enough for me!

17:31.091 --> 17:32.592
Drink up, everyone!

17:32.676 --> 17:34.052
Liquid gold.

17:40.392 --> 17:42.351
Look at my range of motion!

17:42.394 --> 17:44.228
My elbow doesn't creak!

17:44.313 --> 17:46.564
I'm melting away the pounds!

17:46.607 --> 17:48.900
Hair! I've got hair!

17:48.984 --> 17:51.569
By golly, this stuff really works!

18:00.746 --> 18:03.206
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

18:03.707 --> 18:06.959
<i>I'm milking the Milky Way</i>

18:08.045 --> 18:11.089
<i>I'm loving this lovely day</i>

18:11.131 --> 18:14.425
<i>And I feel like a million</i>

18:14.510 --> 18:15.843
Wow zee wow

18:15.928 --> 18:17.970
<i>This cat is back, and how</i>

18:18.055 --> 18:23.559
<i>I'm taking my big-time bow</i>
<i>and I feel like a million</i>

18:23.602 --> 18:28.231
<i>Feel like a million</i>
<i>in a million ways</i>

18:28.273 --> 18:34.403
<i>Feel like a million</i>

18:45.707 --> 18:47.667
Well, that worked.

18:49.294 --> 18:50.545
Suckers!

18:52.631 --> 18:54.132
It's like a dream come true.

18:54.174 --> 18:56.843
I put slime in a bottle,
call it a youth potion

18:56.927 --> 18:58.636
and they can't get enough.

18:58.846 --> 19:01.139
I'll be rich!

19:01.181 --> 19:03.850
I'll be on top of the world! Again!

19:08.438 --> 19:09.647
Shut up!

19:10.315 --> 19:12.984
Could she be crazier? Cuckoo!

19:13.068 --> 19:15.361
You see what's going on here,
don't you, folks?

19:15.445 --> 19:18.614
Here's a hint. You got sewer slime,
fancy packaging,

19:18.657 --> 19:21.659
crazy laugh like a demon from
the bowels of the earth. It's a scam!

19:21.702 --> 19:25.121
Her potion's a fake!
She's selling snake oil, people!

19:25.164 --> 19:26.622
Wake up!

19:26.665 --> 19:28.833
You saw it already?

19:28.876 --> 19:32.003
Well, smarty, I bet you didn't see this!

19:36.508 --> 19:39.010
That's gonna haunt me
in my nightmares.

19:39.094 --> 19:40.595
Can we just move on, please?

19:43.515 --> 19:45.266
Guy in the booth!

19:46.059 --> 19:47.185
Now!

19:55.569 --> 19:58.070
Big load of happy coming through.

20:00.073 --> 20:02.241
Doesn't get better than this, does it?

20:02.326 --> 20:05.161
I'm making tons of cash
for my house fund.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.705
Now if only I could find
a house on a hill.

20:07.789 --> 20:10.541
Kronk, heard you were looking
for a house on a hill.

20:10.626 --> 20:13.753
-You heard right.
-We need money for more potion.

20:13.837 --> 20:16.797
-Yeah?
-So we're selling the senior home.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.216
Good luck with that.

20:20.719 --> 20:21.719
How much?

20:23.096 --> 20:25.181
Sold! Look, everyone!

20:25.224 --> 20:26.557
I sold the house!

20:28.560 --> 20:30.394
Okay. Take care. Bye-bye.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.566
Yeah. It's all coming together.

20:42.241 --> 20:46.744
<i>Dear Papi, remember how you</i>
<i>never thought I'd amount to anything?</i>

20:46.828 --> 20:49.330
<i>Well, I got news for you.</i>

20:49.414 --> 20:50.706
<i>Good news!</i>

20:50.749 --> 20:54.961
<i>I finally got that big house on a hill</i>
<i>you always wanted me to have.</i>

20:55.045 --> 20:56.087
<i>It's really great.</i>

20:56.129 --> 20:59.131
<i>You're gonna love it.</i>
<i>It's got all the amenities.</i>

20:59.216 --> 21:00.383
<i>Swimming pool,</i>

21:01.760 --> 21:03.427
<i>golf course...</i>

21:03.804 --> 21:05.513
<i>The windmill's a killer.</i>

21:06.265 --> 21:07.974
<i>And my favorite part of all...</i>

21:09.685 --> 21:12.770
<i>Pancake Junction!</i>

21:13.438 --> 21:16.691
<i>I even built a cozy little</i>
<i>guest wing just for you.</i>

21:16.775 --> 21:21.320
<i>Yep. Just a big, serious house</i>
<i>for a big, serious guy.</i>

21:21.405 --> 21:24.407
Like me. That's who I am.
Marge, you getting all this?

21:24.449 --> 21:26.284
-Tina.
-Right. Sorry.

21:26.326 --> 21:28.953
Anyway, Papi,
don't just take my word for it.

21:29.037 --> 21:30.663
Come see for yourself.

21:30.747 --> 21:32.957
I know you're
gonna be so proud of your...

21:33.375 --> 21:34.375
Little Kronker.

21:34.459 --> 21:35.918
-Mr. Kronk?
-Yes, Tina?

21:35.961 --> 21:37.295
-Marge.
-Right.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.714
Wait. What?

21:39.798 --> 21:43.175
-A Mr. Rudy is here to see you.
-Rudy? Rudy who?

21:43.260 --> 21:44.635
Hey, Kronk!

21:47.097 --> 21:48.472
That Rudy.

21:48.598 --> 21:50.433
Long time no see!

21:50.475 --> 21:52.393
Rudy! What happened to you?

21:52.477 --> 21:55.896
You're not wearing any clothes.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.064
Oh, that.

21:57.149 --> 22:00.151
I sold my clothes to buy
more of Yzma's youth potion.

22:00.193 --> 22:01.319
You sold your clothes?

22:01.361 --> 22:04.572
I sold everything.
We even sold the senior home.

22:04.656 --> 22:07.116
-You sold your home?
-Yeah. To you.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.451
Yeah.

22:08.994 --> 22:11.829
-We're flat broke.
-That's awful.

22:11.913 --> 22:15.166
I know. I can't afford
any more youth potion.

22:15.584 --> 22:18.586
Think you can do anything
to help out an old friend?

22:20.714 --> 22:22.840
How about if I spot you a bottle?

22:22.924 --> 22:24.842
My precious!

22:25.093 --> 22:29.513
Kronk just wants to keep it.
We must not let him. No!

22:29.973 --> 22:32.683
Something's just not right here.

22:34.144 --> 22:36.020
Figure that out on your own, genius?

22:36.063 --> 22:37.938
Yeah, sure did.

22:38.023 --> 22:40.900
-Figured what out?
-Okay.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.863
Take a look at your pal, Rudy.

22:45.947 --> 22:47.531
This is before.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.658
This is after.

22:49.701 --> 22:52.078
Before. After.

22:52.162 --> 22:53.704
You see any difference?

22:55.374 --> 22:58.125
Can I see "before" again?

23:00.170 --> 23:02.671
Well, I give up.
They look exactly the same.

23:04.716 --> 23:07.635
He looks exactly the same,
so the potion is worthless,

23:07.719 --> 23:11.305
and Yzma's a crook, and it's all
my fault because I helped her do it.

23:11.681 --> 23:14.475
What's the problem?
Look at him. He's happy.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.232
Fine. You win.

23:22.442 --> 23:23.526
Oh, yeah.

23:25.862 --> 23:27.071
Rudy?

23:34.621 --> 23:37.540
Yzma's youth potion is a fake.

23:39.167 --> 23:40.584
She cheated you.

23:51.721 --> 23:54.515
And... I cheated you too.

24:04.693 --> 24:06.026
I'm sorry.

24:17.664 --> 24:19.748
I guess we better go tell the others.

24:20.167 --> 24:22.418
The others! I almost forgot!

24:22.461 --> 24:25.421
They're about to elect Yzma emperor!

24:25.464 --> 24:27.298
I never knew that was an elective office.

24:27.382 --> 24:32.511
-Yzma for emperor!
-Thank you, thank you!

24:32.596 --> 24:35.806
I'd like to thank all the little people,

24:35.849 --> 24:37.349
but what do they matter?

24:37.434 --> 24:40.561
What matters is me, me, me!

24:41.563 --> 24:43.939
And when you elect me
as your new emperor,

24:43.982 --> 24:46.400
I'm going to be on top of the world!

24:55.577 --> 24:57.661
-Stop this charade!
-Yzma's youth potion is a fake!

24:59.414 --> 25:02.500
Kronk? What are you doing?

25:02.542 --> 25:05.586
I want you all to look at Rudy...

25:06.254 --> 25:07.796
And tell me what you see.

25:08.632 --> 25:11.634
That is one hot hunk of man!

25:14.387 --> 25:16.138
He's in his golden years.

25:16.181 --> 25:19.266
Not getting any younger.
Chronologically challenged.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.060
I got wrinkles,

25:21.144 --> 25:23.312
bunions, ear hair!

25:23.355 --> 25:25.439
I'm still old!

25:25.524 --> 25:28.651
Hey, he's right. I'm still old too.

25:29.444 --> 25:32.196
Me too! And Hildy looks like...

25:32.822 --> 25:33.822
Don't even!

25:33.865 --> 25:35.574
Yzma's a crook!

25:36.076 --> 25:38.661
-Yzma's a witch!
-Would you excuse me a moment?

25:39.496 --> 25:40.955
Get her!

25:41.331 --> 25:43.207
She's getting away!

25:45.669 --> 25:47.503
Come on, fellas!

25:47.546 --> 25:49.046
Hit it, girls!

26:33.508 --> 26:36.302
-There she is!
-She's a liar!

26:36.386 --> 26:38.137
-Get her!
-Stop her!

26:38.221 --> 26:41.348
-Don't let her get away!
-Shame on you!

26:42.100 --> 26:43.434
Got you!

26:46.438 --> 26:48.147
Back off, or I'll jump!

26:51.484 --> 26:53.277
Wait! That can't be right.

26:54.070 --> 26:56.947
Okay. Why don't we all
just take a step back?

26:57.032 --> 26:58.657
Not you, Yzma.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.285
She stole everything we have!

27:01.369 --> 27:05.080
Yeah, we didn't chase her
all the way down here for nothing!

27:05.790 --> 27:07.708
Nice moves back there, Hildy.

27:08.251 --> 27:11.545
What about you?
Pouncing like a wildcat.

27:12.756 --> 27:15.299
Hey, I just realized something.

27:15.342 --> 27:17.968
We chased Yzma
all the way down here.

27:18.053 --> 27:19.803
Didn't I just cover that?

27:19.846 --> 27:24.642
Don't you see? We're busting moves
like a bunch of teenagers!

27:25.977 --> 27:27.686
So, what you're saying is,

27:27.771 --> 27:31.940
even though the potion was fake,
we're only as old as we feel.

27:31.983 --> 27:35.861
It's like you should thank Yzma
for robbing you of every last cent.

27:37.155 --> 27:38.489
Wait. That can't be right.

27:38.573 --> 27:41.241
-Let's get her!
-Stand back!

27:41.326 --> 27:42.534
Don't make me use this!

27:44.329 --> 27:46.413
Your cough medicine?

27:46.498 --> 27:49.333
No! My most fiendishly
diabolical potion ever!

27:49.417 --> 27:53.003
When I drink this, you won't
be able to lay a finger on me!

27:59.844 --> 28:01.387
Get her!

28:07.185 --> 28:09.186
-How cute!
-Cutie pie!

28:09.229 --> 28:11.146
See? I told you so.

28:15.944 --> 28:17.361
That's weird.

28:17.445 --> 28:20.531
Let's all reflect on these lessons
on our way home tonight.

28:20.615 --> 28:23.534
Well, everyone, back to the alley.

28:23.576 --> 28:25.911
-You're living in an alley?
-Well, sure.

28:25.995 --> 28:28.163
We sold our house to you.

28:28.206 --> 28:31.542
I got dibs on the cardboard box!

28:31.584 --> 28:33.460
Come on! You had the box last night.

28:33.545 --> 28:34.545
It's my turn.

28:35.380 --> 28:38.298
This is awful.
I've got to find them a place to live.

28:38.383 --> 28:41.510
But where can I find a gigantic house
with 30 extra bedrooms?

28:41.553 --> 28:44.388
Where? Think, think, think!

28:45.056 --> 28:48.058
-You thinking what I'm thinking?
-Too much salt in my spinach puffs?

28:48.101 --> 28:50.185
Oh, no! Your house!

28:50.228 --> 28:51.812
Right!

28:51.896 --> 28:54.857
Whoa, Nelly! Let's not overreact.

28:54.899 --> 28:56.400
You wanna lose your dream house?

28:56.484 --> 28:59.862
That's gonna get us
the big thumbs up from Papi.

28:59.904 --> 29:02.573
If I lose the house, I'll let Papi down.

29:02.615 --> 29:03.824
I can't let Papi down.

29:03.908 --> 29:05.826
But you tricked Rudy out of that house!

29:05.910 --> 29:09.079
Oh, my! It's true!
I took away Rudy's home!

29:09.164 --> 29:11.582
Hey! You got that house
fair and square!

29:11.624 --> 29:13.417
Yeah, but he cheated his best friend!

29:13.460 --> 29:15.252
No, he didn't!

29:16.463 --> 29:18.046
Yes, I did.

29:23.011 --> 29:25.012
I gotta do the right thing.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.139
Rudy!

29:27.932 --> 29:29.349
Let's talk real estate.

29:41.613 --> 29:42.905
Looking jiggy, Burt!

29:42.947 --> 29:44.907
Feeling jiggy, Kronk!

29:50.121 --> 29:54.082
All aboard for Pancake Junction!

29:55.376 --> 29:58.128
Tina! Marge! You'll be okay.

29:58.171 --> 29:59.671
I'll help you land on your feet.

29:59.756 --> 30:01.048
Don't worry about us.

30:01.132 --> 30:03.801
We've been contacted
by a team of headhunters.

30:06.805 --> 30:10.432
-But what's going to happen to you?
-Yes. You're giving up everything.

30:10.475 --> 30:13.644
No worries.
I may be giving up everything,

30:13.728 --> 30:15.813
but it was the right thing to do.

30:15.897 --> 30:18.982
So when you think of our
brief time together here,

30:19.067 --> 30:21.401
don't cry for me, Marge and Tina.

30:24.197 --> 30:25.697
You didn't!

30:26.783 --> 30:28.200
Afraid so.

30:29.452 --> 30:32.162
Oy. Enough with the pity party.
You did good.

30:32.205 --> 30:34.498
End of story. Back to work.

30:34.582 --> 30:37.000
Yeah, but doing good
cost me my dream house.

30:37.085 --> 30:39.294
-And then...
-Don't tell me.

30:39.337 --> 30:40.879
It cost me my girl.

30:40.964 --> 30:42.506
I said don't tell me.

30:42.549 --> 30:45.843
These oven mitts were
the last thing she touched,

30:45.927 --> 30:47.845
other than my fragile heart...

30:47.929 --> 30:48.929
Oy.

30:49.013 --> 30:51.014
Before she walked out of my life.

30:52.141 --> 30:53.475
Roll film!

30:56.980 --> 30:58.063
Wrong movie.

31:00.149 --> 31:03.026
<i>All hail to Camp Chippamunka</i>

31:03.111 --> 31:05.195
<i>We proudly pledge</i>
<i>our troth to thee</i>

31:05.280 --> 31:06.280
What's a troth?

31:06.364 --> 31:08.991
<i>It all happened</i>
<i>at Camp Chippamunka.</i>

31:09.033 --> 31:11.326
<i>And greet our leaders cheerfully</i>

31:11.369 --> 31:12.369
Yeah, right!

31:12.453 --> 31:14.705
<i>We were there</i>
<i>for the Chipmunk Challenge.</i>

31:15.373 --> 31:19.293
<i>We won Troop of the Year</i>
<i>two years running, going for three.</i>

31:19.377 --> 31:22.337
<i>C-H-I-P-P-amunka can't you see</i>

31:22.380 --> 31:25.340
<i>You are the acorn of my eye</i>

31:25.383 --> 31:28.051
Okay, Chippers!
First, we gotta pitch the tents.

31:30.805 --> 31:34.141
And then we'll review
some basic camping terminology.

31:36.811 --> 31:38.645
Hey, Bucky.

31:40.690 --> 31:43.942
There's a new troop leader
named Birdwell...

31:44.027 --> 31:46.737
Who wants to take away our... Trophy!

31:47.488 --> 31:51.033
Look at them.
They're really snot and polish.

31:51.075 --> 31:53.702
Yeah. It's "spit and polish."

31:53.745 --> 31:54.745
-Snot.
-Spit.

31:54.829 --> 31:56.163
-Snot!
-Spit!

31:56.247 --> 31:59.625
Easy, kids. Spit, snot,
same general neighborhood.

31:59.709 --> 32:03.545
And don't worry about
this Birdwell guy, whoever he is.

32:03.588 --> 32:06.423
The important thing here
is that there are no losers.

32:06.507 --> 32:08.926
But you always win. Right, Kronk?

32:09.010 --> 32:10.427
We always win.

32:10.470 --> 32:13.513
But winning's not what really counts.

32:13.598 --> 32:14.973
Remember our motto.

32:15.058 --> 32:17.225
"Keep the focus on fun!"

32:19.145 --> 32:22.814
Two shorts and a long.
The Aquatic Games are about to begin!

32:22.899 --> 32:24.524
You know what that means, Tipo?

32:24.609 --> 32:25.776
Right.

32:25.860 --> 32:28.278
Last one in's a rotten egg!

32:32.784 --> 32:35.535
Halt! Left face!

32:35.620 --> 32:38.664
-Troop leader?
-Yes, Junior Chipmunk?

32:38.748 --> 32:40.123
Permission to speak.

32:40.166 --> 32:41.333
Granted.

32:41.417 --> 32:44.419
Yoli's afraid of the water again.

32:47.465 --> 32:51.009
It's not me! It's Mrs. Queetzo.

32:51.094 --> 32:53.845
Oh, gosh. Well,
we can't have that, can we?

32:53.930 --> 32:55.681
Now, give me the doll.

32:55.765 --> 32:59.017
Yes. I'll have to have
a word with her. Now...

33:01.521 --> 33:03.355
See here, Mrs. Queetzo.

33:03.439 --> 33:06.024
Yoli is a top-notch swimmer,

33:06.109 --> 33:08.819
and she's very, very brave.

33:08.861 --> 33:11.321
So steady as you go, Chipper.

33:11.364 --> 33:14.116
You're in excellent hands.

33:14.242 --> 33:15.283
Yes.

33:16.869 --> 33:19.454
Super-duper! That's more like it.

33:19.497 --> 33:21.373
What did she say?

33:21.457 --> 33:23.750
She's going to be just tickety-boo.

33:23.835 --> 33:24.835
Very well then.

33:24.919 --> 33:27.170
And off you go.

33:30.258 --> 33:33.760
Let the aquatic competition begin!

33:37.682 --> 33:39.850
Yeah!

33:39.892 --> 33:41.560
This is gonna be fun!

33:46.941 --> 33:48.108
Hurry up!

33:51.362 --> 33:53.989
Cannonball! Cannonball!

33:59.120 --> 34:02.789
I'm so proud of my little Chippers.

34:03.082 --> 34:04.541
Oh, dear. Are you all right?

34:07.670 --> 34:09.296
You're a troop leader.

34:09.380 --> 34:12.007
Are you hurt? Can you speak?

34:12.717 --> 34:16.011
Blink if you can hear me.

34:16.054 --> 34:19.890
<i>She was a vision. Feet</i>
<i>like a pair of landlocked tugboats.</i>

34:19.932 --> 34:21.892
<i>Knees like brass doorknobs.</i>

34:21.976 --> 34:25.771
<i>Elbows so rough they could take</i>
<i>the grain right off a two-by-four.</i>

34:25.855 --> 34:27.397
<i>And her eyes.</i>

34:27.440 --> 34:29.900
<i>They say the eyes</i>
<i>are the window to the soul.</i>

34:29.942 --> 34:33.070
<i>Hers were more like</i>
<i>steel-reinforced security doors</i>

34:33.154 --> 34:35.739
<i>with a combination I just had to crack.</i>

34:36.115 --> 34:37.783
<i>No doubt about it.</i>

34:38.117 --> 34:41.870
<i>She was the kinda girl</i>
<i>you'd want to bring home to Papi.</i>

34:58.429 --> 35:01.056
The Chipmunk Handshake
of Fellowship, Level Seven.

35:01.099 --> 35:05.268
A level attainable only by
the most dedicated of troop leaders.

35:05.311 --> 35:06.436
You're good.

35:06.479 --> 35:07.938
Well, you're better.

35:07.980 --> 35:09.356
You're sensational.

35:09.440 --> 35:11.191
You're dazzling.

35:11.275 --> 35:13.443
-I'm Kronk.
-I'm Birdwell.

35:15.613 --> 35:18.240
-You're Birdwell?
-Yes.

35:18.282 --> 35:21.868
-But you're a girl!
-Cannonball!

35:33.256 --> 35:35.841
-Awesome!
-Phat wave, dude!

35:35.925 --> 35:37.175
Nice form, Chippers.

35:37.260 --> 35:39.469
What do you think you're doing?

35:40.471 --> 35:41.638
Cannonball?

35:44.308 --> 35:46.643
Look at poor Mrs. Queetzo!

35:46.686 --> 35:49.146
She's all... All...

35:50.773 --> 35:52.023
Wet!

35:52.108 --> 35:55.652
Well, it is a swimming competition.

35:55.987 --> 35:58.238
It's all about the competition with you?

35:58.322 --> 35:59.865
Yeah. Wait. What?

35:59.949 --> 36:01.992
No matter what it does to the tinies?

36:02.535 --> 36:06.288
Hey, I always put my tinies first.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.666
Obsessed with being first. I knew it!

36:09.750 --> 36:13.003
Fortunately, there are rules
about this sort of thing.

36:13.087 --> 36:15.130
What sort of thing?

36:15.798 --> 36:19.593
Rule 4.7, paragraph A,
subsection 2, revised,

36:19.677 --> 36:21.845
"Troops shall compete
in alphabetical order.

36:21.929 --> 36:24.181
"B before K, except after May,

36:24.265 --> 36:27.684
"or when sounding like A
as in 'neighbor' or 'weigh'."

36:28.060 --> 36:30.645
-Says who?
-Says the Official Chipmunk Rulebook.

36:30.688 --> 36:31.813
No way!

36:33.399 --> 36:34.482
Way!

36:34.525 --> 36:37.444
Troop Kronk is disqualified!

36:39.488 --> 36:43.283
The aquatic competition
goes to Troop Birdwell!

36:44.869 --> 36:46.286
Hey! That's not fair!

36:46.370 --> 36:49.289
You ruined the aquatic event
for my poppets.

36:49.373 --> 36:51.875
But now you've ruined it for my...

36:51.918 --> 36:53.752
-Poppets.
-Poppets! I knew that!

36:53.836 --> 36:56.463
You should've thought of that sooner.

36:56.547 --> 36:58.924
Come along, Chippers! Toodle pip!

37:02.803 --> 37:04.888
Why is this happening?

37:04.972 --> 37:07.599
I just don't understand.

37:07.683 --> 37:09.935
It just doesn't make any sense.

37:10.019 --> 37:12.604
Was it loop over, loop under and pull,

37:12.688 --> 37:14.522
or loop under, loop over and pull?

37:15.483 --> 37:17.317
Tipo? You okay, little pal?

37:17.401 --> 37:19.444
We're gonna lose the trophy
because of her.

37:19.528 --> 37:21.029
Yeah!

37:22.907 --> 37:26.409
Now, now. Let's keep the focus on fun.

37:27.328 --> 37:30.038
-What about her?
-She disqualified us!

37:30.081 --> 37:33.750
Yeah, and you're the best
troop leader ever, Kronk.

37:33.793 --> 37:35.794
She can't do that to you.

37:36.671 --> 37:38.129
Can she?

37:39.632 --> 37:42.467
Just who does she think she is?

37:42.551 --> 37:44.552
Just who does he think he is?

37:46.097 --> 37:49.474
Poor Yoli.
You'll catch your death of cold.

37:50.226 --> 37:52.269
And then he tries to act all innocent.

37:52.311 --> 37:55.605
Thinks he can charm me
with those rippling muscles

37:55.690 --> 37:58.233
and that... That... Crooked smile

37:58.276 --> 38:03.029
and those deep, deep sensitive eyes.

38:07.576 --> 38:10.704
No! He can't do this
to my little Chippers.

38:10.788 --> 38:13.123
She can't do this to my little Chippers.

38:13.207 --> 38:15.292
-Yeah!
-That's it. That's it.

38:15.376 --> 38:18.962
The gloves are coming off.
We're going mano a womano.

38:19.005 --> 38:21.381
-Let the games begin!
-Let the games begin!

39:06.844 --> 39:09.179
Stroke! Stroke!

39:21.150 --> 39:24.527
So. It all comes down to one event.

39:24.570 --> 39:26.321
The Chipmunk Cheer-Off!

39:26.364 --> 39:28.656
-There's only one thing to do.
-There's only one thing to do.

39:28.908 --> 39:31.576
Practice, practice, practice!

39:31.660 --> 39:36.039
Do whatever it takes to win!
Here's how we're gonna do it!

39:36.123 --> 39:39.292
We're gonna hit them hard.
Come at them with everything we got.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.044
Get out there and give a 110 percent!

39:41.128 --> 39:43.797
Whatever happened to
"Keep the focus on fun"?

39:44.715 --> 39:48.885
We can't let him down. We just
gotta win that trophy for Kronk!

39:48.969 --> 39:51.054
You know what I'd do? Cheat.

39:51.847 --> 39:54.724
What am I hearing? You can't do that!

39:55.559 --> 39:56.976
Stop it!

39:57.561 --> 40:00.397
Crybaby, crybaby,
stick your head in pie, baby!

40:00.439 --> 40:02.440
Make him stop! Make him...

40:03.401 --> 40:06.778
Hey! Kronk said,
"Do whatever it takes to win."

40:06.862 --> 40:08.446
Right.

40:09.990 --> 40:11.574
Whatever it takes.

40:13.077 --> 40:15.745
Chin up, Chipmunks! Victory is ours!

40:15.788 --> 40:19.374
Soon as we practice our routine
ten times through without a mistake.

40:22.586 --> 40:25.922
Spirit smiles! I want to see spirit smiles!

40:27.007 --> 40:29.134
Yes. That's more like it!

40:29.218 --> 40:30.718
Peppy and poised!

40:30.761 --> 40:34.431
Remember, don't think of your
opponents as a rival troop.

40:34.473 --> 40:36.641
-Think of them as...
-The enemy!

40:36.725 --> 40:38.101
Layout. Very good.

40:38.144 --> 40:39.978
This is no ordinary cheer-off.

40:40.062 --> 40:41.896
Basket toss. Higher!

40:41.939 --> 40:44.941
This is a test of everything we stand for!

40:44.984 --> 40:48.736
-The culmination of all of our efforts!
-You call that a backflip?

40:48.779 --> 40:52.782
By this time tomorrow,
the trophy will be ours!

40:52.825 --> 40:54.200
Right, Chipmunks?

40:56.579 --> 40:57.745
Chipmunks?

40:58.205 --> 41:00.748
Oh, man! This really stinks.

41:00.791 --> 41:01.875
Yeah.

41:01.959 --> 41:03.418
I want to go swimming.

41:03.461 --> 41:05.170
I want to have some fun.

41:05.254 --> 41:07.297
I want to go home.

41:11.719 --> 41:13.428
This is all her fault.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.638
This is all his fault.

41:16.015 --> 41:19.809
Well, if there's one sure-fire way
to cheer up a Chipmunk...

41:19.852 --> 41:21.519
It's raisin bread.

41:21.604 --> 41:23.480
Okay, flour.

41:23.522 --> 41:25.815
Sugar, raisins, yeast.

41:26.609 --> 41:27.734
I'm out of eggs!

41:39.663 --> 41:41.873
Look at her. She's upset.

41:41.957 --> 41:44.000
Take that, you...

41:44.502 --> 41:47.504
You, you, you, you... Take that!

41:47.546 --> 41:50.507
"Upset"? She's beating me in effigy.

41:50.591 --> 41:55.428
But her soul yearns for
the soothing salve of human kindness.

41:55.513 --> 41:58.181
Go to her. Go.

42:00.768 --> 42:03.269
Hey, look. Aren't those your eggs?

42:06.565 --> 42:08.733
Hey! What are you
doing with my eggs?

42:10.069 --> 42:12.695
What are you doing
with my raisins, sir?

42:12.738 --> 42:15.198
-These aren't yours.
-"Birdwell's raisins.

42:15.282 --> 42:18.993
"Property of Birdwell.
Do not touch except for Birdwell."

42:19.620 --> 42:21.037
You think I would have seen that.

42:23.374 --> 42:25.583
-I need those raisins.
-I need them more.

42:25.668 --> 42:28.586
-You're ruining this.
-You're wrecking it.

42:28.671 --> 42:30.922
-You disqualified us!
-You tried to drown us!

42:31.006 --> 42:33.466
-This is all your fault.
-This is all your fault!

42:33.551 --> 42:35.134
-Is not.
-Is too!

42:35.219 --> 42:36.553
-You twit!
-Give.

42:36.637 --> 42:38.263
-You give!
-You!

43:07.126 --> 43:11.254
So, your kids are really unhappy, huh?

43:12.047 --> 43:13.881
Rock-bottom, actually.

43:15.593 --> 43:19.971
I'm the worst troop leader ever.

43:27.980 --> 43:30.773
-How did we go wrong?
-I just became so competitive.

43:30.858 --> 43:33.318
Yes, but I'm even
more competitive than you.

43:33.402 --> 43:34.736
You mean like that?

43:37.364 --> 43:39.657
Hey, I like it when you laugh.

43:42.036 --> 43:43.119
I've got a proposition.

43:43.162 --> 43:45.330
My eggs, your raisins.

43:45.414 --> 43:48.041
We could bake
beautiful bread together.

43:48.125 --> 43:50.501
Get out your oven mitts.

43:50.586 --> 43:52.629
Things are about to get...

43:53.297 --> 43:54.339
Hot.

45:16.255 --> 45:18.631
I'm queen of the world!

45:44.032 --> 45:46.743
Come on. Throw caution to the wind.

45:46.827 --> 45:50.079
I can't. You'll laugh at me.

45:50.164 --> 45:51.664
Don't you trust me?

45:51.749 --> 45:53.583
I do trust you.

46:01.759 --> 46:04.969
It's like a whole new you.

46:05.053 --> 46:06.429
Really?

46:07.514 --> 46:11.142
I think this has been
the best night of my whole life.

46:11.769 --> 46:13.186
Me too.

46:13.270 --> 46:15.855
Good night, Kronky-poo.

46:15.939 --> 46:19.233
Good night, Ms... Birdy-poo.

46:30.162 --> 46:32.163
Kronky-poo?

46:32.247 --> 46:34.916
I'm okay! I'm fine!

46:42.257 --> 46:44.217
<i>Dear Papi,</i>

46:44.301 --> 46:48.221
<i>remember how I've never</i>
<i>been able to meet the right girl?</i>

46:48.639 --> 46:50.223
<i>Any girl?</i>

46:50.307 --> 46:53.810
<i>Well, I finally found</i>
<i>the woman of my dreams.</i>

46:53.852 --> 46:56.979
<i>She's everything</i>
<i>you could want in a woman...</i>

46:57.022 --> 46:58.314
<i>And more.</i>

46:59.274 --> 47:02.777
<i>Don't get too excited.</i>
<i>We'll take it nice and slow at first.</i>

47:03.904 --> 47:05.613
<i>We'll marry in a fancy ceremony</i>

47:05.656 --> 47:07.448
<i>and have lots of kids. Love, Kronk.</i>

47:15.666 --> 47:16.833
Perfect!

47:21.296 --> 47:24.173
He found his one true love!

47:24.258 --> 47:26.592
That is so beautiful!

47:31.223 --> 47:33.558
Can I have a moment, please?
Turn away.

47:38.105 --> 47:40.940
Okay. Okay. All better.

47:41.024 --> 47:43.943
Go, go, go. Go back to the funny.
I'm bringing you down.

47:45.988 --> 47:49.824
<i>...loyal, brave and courteous</i>

47:49.867 --> 47:53.953
<i>And greet our leaders cheerfully...</i>

47:56.123 --> 47:59.375
-Good morning, Chippers!
-We've got a surprise for you.

48:02.421 --> 48:04.088
Raisin bread!

48:04.882 --> 48:08.050
The one sure-fire way
to cheer up a Chipmunk!

48:09.553 --> 48:12.054
Gotta tell you, Chippers, I'm...

48:12.097 --> 48:14.223
Not proud of how
I've been acting lately.

48:14.266 --> 48:16.267
Neither am I, Kronky-poo.

48:17.394 --> 48:19.312
"Kronky-poo"?

48:19.396 --> 48:24.066
So we're here to declare that
the feud between us is officially over.

48:24.109 --> 48:26.027
That means no more hostility...

48:26.069 --> 48:28.571
-Quarreling...
-One-upmanship...

48:28.614 --> 48:30.489
We're doing it again, aren't we?

48:30.574 --> 48:33.075
They're finishing
each other's sentences.

48:33.160 --> 48:35.161
Yeah, it's creepy.

48:35.913 --> 48:38.331
But nice creepy.

48:38.415 --> 48:41.918
The competition between our
troops has gotten out of hand.

48:41.960 --> 48:44.629
Which brings us to
this afternoon's final event.

48:44.713 --> 48:48.215
-The Chipmunk Cheer-Off.
-You're not canceling the cheer-off?

48:48.258 --> 48:51.636
Yeah. We've been working
on our routines all year!

48:51.720 --> 48:54.305
Very well, but only on one condition.

48:54.389 --> 48:56.641
From now on, we want you to play fair...

48:56.725 --> 48:58.017
Be good sports...

48:58.101 --> 48:59.852
-And...
-And...

48:59.937 --> 49:02.605
Keep the focus on fun!

49:03.231 --> 49:04.440
-I'm so proud of them.
-I'm so proud of them.

49:04.733 --> 49:06.108
Hey, where's Tipo?

49:07.653 --> 49:09.654
Kronk is gonna love this.

49:09.738 --> 49:12.281
Scrape out these seed pods,
mash them into itching powder,

49:12.366 --> 49:15.159
sneak the powder into
their chalk at the cheer-off,

49:15.243 --> 49:18.955
and they'll be completely humiliated
while we achieve total domination!

49:27.714 --> 49:28.798
Everybody ready?

49:28.882 --> 49:30.299
-Megaphones?
-Check!

49:30.425 --> 49:31.759
-Pom-poms?
-Check!

49:31.802 --> 49:33.594
-Team spirit?
-Go, team!

49:33.637 --> 49:34.971
Go, team!

49:35.013 --> 49:38.933
Chaca, there is no "I" in "team."

49:38.976 --> 49:41.894
But there's a "U" in "euphoric."

49:41.979 --> 49:44.063
And there's a "me" in...

49:44.773 --> 49:46.273
"Mediocre."

49:48.568 --> 49:50.319
I got you something.

49:50.362 --> 49:51.696
For me?

49:51.780 --> 49:53.948
I know this is all really new.

49:54.658 --> 49:57.660
And I hope you won't think
that I'm moving too fast,

49:57.744 --> 50:00.746
but there comes a time when
a man's gotta say how he feels.

50:05.669 --> 50:07.128
Oh, Kronk.

50:07.170 --> 50:09.964
Monogrammed oven mitts.

50:11.174 --> 50:12.675
Just my size.

50:16.680 --> 50:19.265
Good luck, Kronky-poo.

50:20.684 --> 50:22.268
Thanks, Ms. Birdy-poo.

50:26.523 --> 50:28.858
Yo, crowd, let's get loud!

50:31.278 --> 50:32.695
Go, Chipmunks!

51:00.557 --> 51:01.724
Awesome!

51:27.959 --> 51:30.753
-All right!
-Yeah!

51:32.464 --> 51:33.547
Yes!

51:34.216 --> 51:36.926
That was wonderful, Kronky-poo!

51:37.010 --> 51:41.013
You're gonna be even better,
not that it matters who wins.

51:41.098 --> 51:43.182
-We've already won.
-We've already won.

51:43.266 --> 51:46.060
Now I know you're just
itching to get out there,

51:46.103 --> 51:48.604
but don't forget to chalk up your hands.

51:48.647 --> 51:50.064
You don't want to fall.

51:50.107 --> 51:51.482
I'm not worried.

51:51.566 --> 51:54.068
I know you'd be there to catch me.

52:12.462 --> 52:13.629
Say what?

52:35.152 --> 52:37.278
This is gonna be so awesome!

52:37.320 --> 52:40.823
-I know. They're really good.
-Yeah, but we're gonna win.

52:40.907 --> 52:42.658
I cheated, just like you said.

52:43.660 --> 52:45.911
That's great, Tipo. Wait, what?

52:45.996 --> 52:48.164
I put itching powder in their chalk.

52:48.248 --> 52:50.583
You said do whatever it takes to win.

52:54.045 --> 52:56.297
<i>I know you'd be there to catch me.</i>

52:56.339 --> 52:58.007
No!

53:15.400 --> 53:16.901
"Tipo's Itching Powder.

53:16.985 --> 53:18.277
"Property of Tipo.

53:18.361 --> 53:19.862
"Do not touch except for..."

53:20.322 --> 53:21.697
Tipo?

53:21.781 --> 53:23.616
How could you?

53:23.700 --> 53:25.326
I'm so disappointed.

53:26.411 --> 53:28.662
Oh, no. What am I gonna do?

53:28.705 --> 53:31.415
Let the kid take the rap.
He'll do easy time.

53:31.499 --> 53:34.376
You put the idea in his head.
Look at him out there.

53:35.045 --> 53:38.547
-He's six.
-The lip. Not the lip.

53:39.466 --> 53:40.925
Don't look directly at it!

53:41.009 --> 53:43.677
Start flapping your jaw,
the girl goes bye-bye.

53:43.720 --> 53:46.222
-Forever?
-Heartbreak City.

53:46.306 --> 53:48.807
-No.
-So you're gonna weasel out

53:48.892 --> 53:51.268
while they send Tipo
off to the big house?

53:52.479 --> 53:55.522
You forgetting something?
You want this, you need that.

53:55.565 --> 53:57.441
Dangerous.
You could have hurt somebody.

53:57.567 --> 54:01.946
I cannot believe that you would disgrace
the Chipmunk name in this manner!

54:02.405 --> 54:04.406
But Tipo needs me.

54:05.325 --> 54:08.077
Let him go! It's all my fault.

54:09.287 --> 54:10.496
Kronky-poo?

54:12.749 --> 54:15.960
You told Tipo to cheat?

54:16.044 --> 54:18.963
I told him... Do whatever it takes to win.

54:26.930 --> 54:28.264
Wait!

54:29.057 --> 54:32.268
-It was all a big mistake.
-I'll say it was.

54:32.352 --> 54:35.479
The biggest mistake of my life!

54:36.898 --> 54:38.941
I thought I could trust you.

54:38.984 --> 54:40.567
But Ms. Birdy-poo...

54:40.610 --> 54:42.695
Don't ever call me that again!

54:43.738 --> 54:45.739
On second thought,

54:46.283 --> 54:48.701
don't call me ever!

55:05.218 --> 55:06.969
She's gone.

55:07.012 --> 55:10.889
And all I have to remember
her by are these.

55:14.436 --> 55:15.686
Now I've got nothing.

55:15.770 --> 55:19.398
No, what you've got
is a full house on fondue night.

55:19.482 --> 55:21.317
Now give me one Havarti party pot

55:21.401 --> 55:24.987
two blue cheese bombs
and a cracker cheddar surprise. Stat!

55:25.030 --> 55:28.032
How can you think of fondue
at a time like this?

55:28.116 --> 55:31.201
Look, you made the right choice.
You saved the kid.

55:31.286 --> 55:32.411
But I lost the girl.

55:32.495 --> 55:35.998
Now I'm a two-time loser, and my
father's gonna be here any minute.

55:36.082 --> 55:38.500
More like any second.

55:39.085 --> 55:40.627
What am I gonna do?

55:40.670 --> 55:42.379
Just tell him the truth.

55:42.464 --> 55:44.673
I can't handle the truth!

55:45.508 --> 55:48.260
Where am I going to find a wife
and kids and house on a hill?

55:48.345 --> 55:49.970
How's dinner coming?

55:50.013 --> 55:53.140
I gotta get the wife and kids
back to our house on the hill.

55:56.519 --> 55:58.354
You want to borrow my house?

55:58.396 --> 56:00.856
-And me?
-And them, if it's no trouble.

56:00.940 --> 56:03.567
Kronk, you should be ashamed
of yourself.

56:03.651 --> 56:06.070
Trust me, I am,
but not as much as I'd be

56:06.154 --> 56:07.988
if Papi finds out I'm a failure.

56:08.031 --> 56:11.033
He'll come with everything.
Cold Shoulder, Frenzied Eyebrow,

56:11.117 --> 56:13.369
Grimace of Doom, Sneer of Despair,
Wince of Guilt,

56:13.411 --> 56:16.246
Scowl of Impending Wrath,
and worst of all,

56:16.331 --> 56:19.416
the Nostril Flare of Total Rejection.

56:23.546 --> 56:24.922
What's wrong with Kronk?

56:25.965 --> 56:29.510
You made him look like a
big fat liar in front of Ms. Birdwell!

56:29.552 --> 56:31.512
Hey, don't guilt-trip the kid!

56:31.554 --> 56:35.224
-It's not his fault.
-No, he's right.

56:35.266 --> 56:36.433
I've got to help him.

56:36.518 --> 56:38.727
Now come on, Chich, he's our friend.

56:38.770 --> 56:39.812
Pacha!

56:39.896 --> 56:42.815
You saw the Nostril Flare
of Total Rejection.

56:42.899 --> 56:45.401
We have to do something
before his father gets here.

56:45.485 --> 56:46.527
Too late. He's here.

56:49.114 --> 56:51.990
-It's him!
-I know what to do!

56:54.577 --> 56:57.413
I'll just wait here, like a sane person.

57:10.718 --> 57:14.263
Kronker?

57:15.723 --> 57:19.226
-Kronker, front and center!
-Yes, sir!

57:23.231 --> 57:24.273
Papi!

57:24.357 --> 57:26.525
What do I look like, your Aunt Matilda?

57:26.609 --> 57:27.860
Put her there!

57:28.903 --> 57:29.945
Papi?

57:32.073 --> 57:33.949
Where are your manners, son?

57:34.325 --> 57:36.535
Sorry. Papi, this is...

57:36.619 --> 57:39.455
-You must be Kronk's wife.
-I'm...

57:41.791 --> 57:43.459
-Chicha.
-Chicha.

57:44.461 --> 57:47.754
How'd this knucklehead
ever land a catch like you?

57:47.797 --> 57:49.965
Well, he just asked.

57:50.800 --> 57:51.967
Really.

57:52.010 --> 57:53.510
And these are my grandkids?

57:55.430 --> 57:58.932
Front and center, kids, and...
Let me have a look at you.

57:59.976 --> 58:02.769
I said front and center!
Names and ages!

58:02.812 --> 58:05.147
Chaca, sir!
Age seven and three-quarters, sir!

58:05.190 --> 58:07.483
And this is Yupi. He's only a half.

58:07.567 --> 58:10.235
And, that's my house up there,

58:10.320 --> 58:11.570
on the hill.

58:16.075 --> 58:18.285
I never thought I'd live to see this.

58:18.328 --> 58:22.289
You, of all people, with a wife,
kids and a house on a hill.

58:23.333 --> 58:25.167
Son, I don't know what to say.

58:32.509 --> 58:34.176
Kronkers!

58:35.386 --> 58:37.679
Now I really don't know what to say.

58:37.722 --> 58:40.682
Who's this... Lovely...

58:40.725 --> 58:43.352
-Lady?
-Well, she's...

58:43.436 --> 58:45.604
-I'm Kronk's...
-Mother-in-law!

58:47.023 --> 58:48.732
-Granny!
-Pach...

58:48.816 --> 58:52.236
Ita! Papi, this is Pachita,

58:52.320 --> 58:53.862
Chicha's mother.

58:56.783 --> 58:58.075
Mother, huh?

59:05.542 --> 59:09.378
Now I see where Chicha gets her looks.

59:09.420 --> 59:11.505
Okay. Who's hungry? Let's eat.

59:11.548 --> 59:12.714
Yeah, I'm starving.

59:12.757 --> 59:15.092
I hope the chef here
knows what he's doing.

59:15.635 --> 59:17.386
Yeah, so do I.

59:18.888 --> 59:22.057
Whoa, little fella!
Where are you going in such a hurry?

59:22.141 --> 59:23.976
Kronk's in trouble! His father's here!

59:24.060 --> 59:26.728
He doesn't have a wife or kids
or a house on the hill.

59:26.813 --> 59:28.689
I've got to help him!

59:28.731 --> 59:31.900
Kronk's in trouble? I know what to do.

59:31.985 --> 59:33.860
Hang on, big fella!

59:33.903 --> 59:36.780
The cavalry's comin'!

59:42.245 --> 59:43.787
Well, isn't this nice, Papi?

59:43.871 --> 59:45.956
You, me, Chicha,

59:46.040 --> 59:47.541
Mom.

59:47.584 --> 59:49.918
So, are you proud of me?

59:49.961 --> 59:51.044
Even a little?

59:51.087 --> 59:54.256
I'm just glad to see you gave up
all those crazy ideas

59:54.340 --> 59:57.426
-about cooking and talking to animals.
-Kronk!

59:58.428 --> 1:00:00.470
Yeah. Crazy.

1:00:00.555 --> 1:00:02.556
-Hey, Kronk, what's cookin'?
-Nothing!

1:00:02.599 --> 1:00:06.977
There's no cooking whatsoever
going on here. No siree.

1:00:07.061 --> 1:00:08.770
-What's he talking about? Him!
-Him who?

1:00:08.855 --> 1:00:10.647
-Guy who was here.
-What?

1:00:10.732 --> 1:00:14.067
-Why's he asking you about cooking?
-Yeah. That's weird.

1:00:14.110 --> 1:00:16.862
It's a... A business deal.

1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:19.239
Kronk's always got something cooking.

1:00:19.282 --> 1:00:20.532
Yeah.

1:00:21.284 --> 1:00:24.328
Speaking of cooking,
what does it take to get food here?

1:00:24.412 --> 1:00:26.788
-Talk to the chef.
-I'll go!

1:00:28.124 --> 1:00:29.499
Perfect.

1:00:29.584 --> 1:00:32.169
Gives us more time
to get to know each other.

1:00:33.171 --> 1:00:34.338
Lucky me.

1:00:34.589 --> 1:00:36.089
I can't do this.

1:00:36.132 --> 1:00:38.842
-Look. Fondue night was your idea.
-Fondue!

1:00:38.926 --> 1:00:42.012
They don't get fed, they come after you.

1:00:42.388 --> 1:00:44.222
Wait. I'll cook.

1:00:46.976 --> 1:00:48.226
Feel that!

1:00:48.311 --> 1:00:49.895
Like a python.

1:00:51.939 --> 1:00:54.024
Ordering. One bucket of brie,

1:00:54.108 --> 1:00:57.152
two Gouda gulps
and a flaming fountain of fondue.

1:00:57.195 --> 1:00:58.528
Cardio special. Got it.

1:00:58.613 --> 1:01:00.989
And a side salad
with poppy seed dressing.

1:01:01.074 --> 1:01:02.074
Papi?

1:01:03.326 --> 1:01:05.327
Kronk! Oh, thank goodness.

1:01:06.663 --> 1:01:09.373
-So?
-So, what?

1:01:09.457 --> 1:01:12.000
Hello! Anybody up there?

1:01:12.043 --> 1:01:13.418
Where's our food?

1:01:13.503 --> 1:01:15.921
I've worked up quite an appetite.

1:01:17.632 --> 1:01:19.257
More water. Be right back.

1:01:19.342 --> 1:01:21.134
Kronk!

1:01:21.177 --> 1:01:24.012
I mean... Kronkles!

1:01:24.055 --> 1:01:26.181
Okay. Stoke the fire. Stir the fondue.

1:01:26.349 --> 1:01:28.016
Chop the onions, lie to Papi.

1:01:28.851 --> 1:01:31.812
-Machu Picchu!
-Kronky-wonky!

1:01:32.522 --> 1:01:33.814
Who is this?

1:01:33.856 --> 1:01:37.442
-Why, I'm the lovely Mrs. Kronk.
-Kronker!

1:01:38.361 --> 1:01:40.195
Right. I'll go check on dinner.

1:01:40.655 --> 1:01:44.074
Hey! Is that any way
to treat the lovely Mrs. Kronk?

1:01:44.158 --> 1:01:47.202
I thought I was the lovely Mrs. Kronk.

1:01:47.286 --> 1:01:51.039
Look at us. Putting on dresses.
Pretending to be women.

1:01:51.249 --> 1:01:52.833
Kronk! What are you doing?

1:01:52.875 --> 1:01:55.877
Dinner rush. Four specials up
and a party of ten in at 8:30.

1:01:55.920 --> 1:01:58.672
-Kronk!
-Kronk? Kronk!

1:01:58.715 --> 1:02:00.298
Let me get this straight.

1:02:00.383 --> 1:02:03.719
She's Mrs. Kronk
and she's Mrs. Kronk?

1:02:03.761 --> 1:02:07.723
-Papi, I can explain.
-I'm the lovely Mrs. Kronk.

1:02:07.807 --> 1:02:10.308
-You're stepping on my face.
-Or maybe not.

1:02:10.393 --> 1:02:13.353
Is there anyone in this town
who isn't Mrs. Kronk?

1:02:14.147 --> 1:02:16.648
-Daddy!
-How about them?

1:02:16.733 --> 1:02:19.901
-Who are they?
-We're Kronk's adorable kids!

1:02:21.988 --> 1:02:23.238
Kronk!

1:02:23.281 --> 1:02:25.407
-Sweetheart!
-Tina, Marge.

1:02:25.450 --> 1:02:26.575
-Marge.
-Tina.

1:02:26.659 --> 1:02:28.994
-Kronk!
-Well, at least that's everybody.

1:02:29.746 --> 1:02:31.413
Boom, baby!

1:02:31.456 --> 1:02:34.374
Like how I weaseled
myself in the movie? Nice.

1:02:34.417 --> 1:02:36.668
-Kuzco?
-How you doing, hot stuff?

1:02:36.753 --> 1:02:37.961
Hot stuff?

1:02:49.056 --> 1:02:52.559
Kronker!

1:02:56.147 --> 1:02:59.775
<i>So this is right</i>
<i>about where we started.</i>

1:02:59.859 --> 1:03:03.904
<i>Miserable. Covered in cheese.</i>

1:03:03.946 --> 1:03:06.698
<i>Trying to hold on to a big fat lie!</i>

1:03:28.679 --> 1:03:30.639
Papi...

1:03:30.723 --> 1:03:33.058
I have a confession.

1:03:33.142 --> 1:03:36.394
I'm not who you think I am. I...

1:03:36.479 --> 1:03:38.563
I'm just a humble fry cook.

1:03:40.399 --> 1:03:42.400
And a delivery boy.

1:03:43.694 --> 1:03:45.695
That's not all.

1:03:46.197 --> 1:03:47.823
Chicha's not my wife.

1:03:48.950 --> 1:03:53.411
None of these folks are my wives.
And these aren't my kids.

1:03:53.496 --> 1:03:55.831
Not even the ones who really are kids.

1:03:56.833 --> 1:03:58.667
Yeah, and that big house up on the hill,

1:03:59.669 --> 1:04:01.670
that's not mine either.

1:04:02.672 --> 1:04:04.047
And Pachita...

1:04:07.677 --> 1:04:09.177
Not even a woman.

1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:12.973
I lied to you, Papi.

1:04:13.015 --> 1:04:15.684
I just wanted you to be proud of me.

1:04:15.726 --> 1:04:17.727
I just wanted to get...

1:04:17.812 --> 1:04:19.896
One of these.

1:04:19.981 --> 1:04:21.940
But all I ever got from you was...

1:04:23.526 --> 1:04:24.693
Yeah, that.

1:04:28.406 --> 1:04:30.031
I'm a failure.

1:04:31.117 --> 1:04:33.201
The truth is...

1:04:33.244 --> 1:04:34.703
I've got nothing.

1:04:40.376 --> 1:04:42.210
But Kronk,

1:04:42.253 --> 1:04:43.712
you've got us.

1:04:45.172 --> 1:04:47.674
And I wouldn't trade
you guys for anything.

1:04:47.717 --> 1:04:50.677
Well, that would explain
why you don't have anything.

1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:54.264
For your information,
Kronk used to have a big house.

1:04:54.348 --> 1:04:55.390
On a hill.

1:04:55.474 --> 1:05:00.145
-But he gave it away to us old folks.
-And he had a girlfriend too.

1:05:00.229 --> 1:05:02.230
They baked us raisin bread.

1:05:02.273 --> 1:05:06.234
He gave up all those things
to protect his friends.

1:05:06.319 --> 1:05:08.528
You were actually
listening to my stories?

1:05:08.571 --> 1:05:10.572
I was weeping on the inside.

1:05:12.408 --> 1:05:13.575
Wait a second.

1:05:18.122 --> 1:05:22.250
I really wouldn't
trade you guys for anything.

1:05:23.044 --> 1:05:24.920
Not even for a thumbs up.

1:05:26.213 --> 1:05:28.423
You see, Papi, you may look at my life

1:05:28.466 --> 1:05:30.258
and think I've got nothing,

1:05:31.093 --> 1:05:33.261
but the truth is...

1:05:34.180 --> 1:05:36.056
I've got everything.

1:05:37.850 --> 1:05:39.309
Not yet, you don't.

1:05:48.611 --> 1:05:50.111
I'm proud of you, son.

1:05:52.448 --> 1:05:53.782
Papi!

1:05:55.534 --> 1:05:57.619
Come here, you little squirt.

1:06:06.671 --> 1:06:08.630
Kronk, wait!

1:06:09.799 --> 1:06:12.842
Tipo! How's my little Chipper?

1:06:12.927 --> 1:06:15.011
I brought a friend.

1:06:22.645 --> 1:06:25.480
Hello, Kronky-poo.

1:06:25.564 --> 1:06:27.148
Ms. Birdy-poo.

1:06:32.363 --> 1:06:34.823
I've missed you so much.

1:06:34.907 --> 1:06:36.449
I missed you more.

1:06:37.493 --> 1:06:38.493
I thought we'd...

1:06:38.536 --> 1:06:40.245
Never see each other again.

1:06:41.372 --> 1:06:43.331
You know what this means.

1:06:43.374 --> 1:06:45.583
If they're finishing
each other's sentences...

1:06:45.668 --> 1:06:47.836
Then it must be true love.

1:06:50.381 --> 1:06:52.799
-Kronk!
-Awesome!

1:06:52.842 --> 1:06:54.926
<i>He's got nothing to prove</i>

1:06:55.011 --> 1:06:59.389
<i>No one has to approve</i>
<i>The way that you move</i>

1:06:59.473 --> 1:07:03.351
<i>Don't have to be smart</i>
<i>or be rich or be smooth</i>

1:07:03.394 --> 1:07:07.564
<i>Take a look in your heart</i>
<i>'Cause it would behoove</i>

1:07:07.648 --> 1:07:09.399
<i>You to know from the start</i>

1:07:09.483 --> 1:07:21.536
<i>-You should be true to your groove</i>
<i>-True to your groove</i>

1:07:21.579 --> 1:07:24.080
<i>Yeah, you should be true to your</i>

1:07:24.165 --> 1:07:26.332
<i>You gotta be true to your groove</i>

1:07:33.549 --> 1:07:35.050
How cute!
