03:30.152 --> 03:32.720
It's not your week, Johnny.

03:33.322 --> 03:36.058
Nope, not your week.

04:15.296 --> 04:17.634
John. How's life?

04:17.733 --> 04:20.668
Same shit, different pile.

04:26.008 --> 04:27.077
Everybody down!

04:27.177 --> 04:30.046
On the ground, now!
Get the hell down!

04:30.146 --> 04:32.650
Hands where I can see 'em!

04:33.750 --> 04:35.885
Open the register!

04:44.026 --> 04:46.093
What's the matter, you deaf?

04:52.868 --> 04:55.169
Hey.

04:56.471 --> 04:58.540
I said, "get down."

05:00.276 --> 05:04.647
You know if you shoot me in the stomach,
my chances of surviving go up, right?

05:05.348 --> 05:07.415
Let me help you out.

05:12.287 --> 05:14.724
How 'bout a hole in the chest?

05:14.824 --> 05:18.061
Oh, yeah, yeah. You're right,
you're right. Effective but unsatisfying.

05:18.161 --> 05:22.698
I'll tell you what. Ha.
The brain stem.

05:25.435 --> 05:27.501
Shoot him!

05:29.905 --> 05:31.474
What? Not your style?

05:31.574 --> 05:33.877
I know, I know.
You're right, you're right.

05:33.977 --> 05:37.013
First thing I do, severed brainstem,
you shit your pants.

05:37.113 --> 05:39.315
You too classy for that.
I got it, I got it.

05:39.415 --> 05:41.384
My favorite.

05:41.484 --> 05:44.354
Classic, but with enough splatter
to let 'em know you mean business.

05:44.454 --> 05:45.555
You fuckin' crazy.

05:45.655 --> 05:47.357
Hey, no, no, no.
I'm crazy and impatient.

05:47.457 --> 05:49.259
Come on, come on. Come on, come on.

05:49.359 --> 05:50.450
- Come on!
- Shoot him!

05:50.550 --> 05:52.562
Don't make me do this myself.
Send me home!

05:52.662 --> 05:55.165
- I don't...
- Shoot me! Shoot me!

05:55.265 --> 05:57.131
Shoot...

05:58.934 --> 06:02.736
You either shoot me,
or stop wastin' my time.

06:51.620 --> 06:54.221
Keep the change.

07:39.901 --> 07:41.170
Ha!

07:41.270 --> 07:43.537
Ha! Ha!

08:07.295 --> 08:10.197
I'm not here. Go away.

08:17.806 --> 08:19.876
- Cindy...
- Save it.

08:19.976 --> 08:24.480
Did I not call you last week,
and tell you I was comin'?

08:24.580 --> 08:25.581
Yeah.

08:25.681 --> 08:28.117
Did I also not email you,
just yesterday,

08:28.217 --> 08:30.653
and remind you that I was comin'?

08:30.753 --> 08:32.688
Yeah, a-and...

08:32.789 --> 08:34.323
And?

08:34.424 --> 08:36.259
And...

08:36.359 --> 08:38.294
I got nothin'.
Look, Cindy, I-I'm sorry.

08:38.394 --> 08:41.128
I don't know what happened.

08:42.964 --> 08:45.468
I know what happened.

08:45.568 --> 08:50.237
Look, Cindy, I'm sorry I forgot
to pick you up from the airport.

08:54.643 --> 08:55.912
Well, if you hadn't have forgotten,

08:56.012 --> 08:59.546
how would I know for sure
that you're my brother?

09:02.326 --> 09:03.976
I'm sorry.

09:04.886 --> 09:07.957
Remember that Jamaican restaurant
we went to with that fish?

09:08.057 --> 09:10.693
Oh, yeah. Coley's, I think it was.

09:10.793 --> 09:13.027
Man, that was so good.

09:13.995 --> 09:17.834
No, no, I had enough
to drink at the wedding.

09:17.934 --> 09:18.768
How was that?

09:18.868 --> 09:20.737
You know me, always a bridesmaid.

09:20.837 --> 09:24.207
Well, that's not gonna change 'cause you
already married to this darn notebook.

09:24.307 --> 09:25.675
You startin' to look alike.

09:25.775 --> 09:26.909
Give me that.

09:27.009 --> 09:28.745
You know my life's in this book.

09:28.845 --> 09:31.779
That's the problem.

09:35.550 --> 09:37.687
You okay?

09:37.787 --> 09:39.853
I'm fine.

09:41.556 --> 09:44.026
I'm fine.

09:44.126 --> 09:47.061
Are you taking your medicine?

09:50.866 --> 09:53.169
Let me see that.

09:53.269 --> 09:54.870
Come on.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.958
Mints?

10:16.058 --> 10:17.392
Really, John?

10:18.393 --> 10:20.830
Look, look, my prescription ran out,

10:20.930 --> 10:22.732
and I don't like takin'
those things anyway.

10:22.832 --> 10:24.734
It make my head all swimmy.

10:24.834 --> 10:27.570
Besides, you're always complainin' about
the shit that comes outta my mouth,

10:27.670 --> 10:30.272
at least now it's minty fresh.

10:35.944 --> 10:38.581
Nice necklace. Who got you that?

10:38.681 --> 10:41.250
Some jerk, brother.

10:41.350 --> 10:45.688
So tell me, how are the,
slums of Brazil treatin' you?

10:45.788 --> 10:48.458
They're fine.
I'm flying back tomorrow.

10:48.558 --> 10:50.726
And <i>favelas</i> aren't slums, John.

10:50.826 --> 10:52.662
There's a lot of culture there.

10:52.762 --> 10:57.667
Oh, cultural slums. That-that makes
it better, but they're still dangerous.

10:57.767 --> 11:00.934
I regret gettin' you involved
in this in the first place.

11:02.103 --> 11:03.805
I'm fine.

11:07.043 --> 11:08.311
You sure about that?

11:08.411 --> 11:10.480
Yes.

11:10.580 --> 11:13.182
I'm just tired, you know.

11:13.282 --> 11:15.082
Jet lag.

11:46.781 --> 11:49.650
Take care of yourself, Johnny.

13:45.633 --> 13:48.104
Katarina.

13:48.204 --> 13:50.606
We'll never win them
over wearing that.

13:50.706 --> 13:55.211
I won't win them over,
but I won't keel over.

13:55.311 --> 13:58.146
Katarina! Katarina!

14:25.673 --> 14:28.175
Cindy.

14:30.445 --> 14:34.349
She's alive. Call an ambulance, now!

14:55.970 --> 14:58.472
- Mornin', boys.
- Sir.

15:10.551 --> 15:12.853
Betty, honey? Coffee please.

15:13.454 --> 15:17.960
<i>Detectives Santo and Bororo from
Rio police are here to see you.</i>

15:18.060 --> 15:22.429
- Okay. Send them in.
<i>- Got it.</i>

15:26.535 --> 15:28.910
- Yeah.
- Good morning, Vice-Consul.

15:29.010 --> 15:32.408
Detective Thiago Santo,
Rio de Janeiro police.

15:32.508 --> 15:36.345
And this is my partner, Carlo Bororo.

15:36.445 --> 15:38.948
- Please, have a seat.
- Oh, thank you.

15:39.048 --> 15:41.751
So, Detective Thiago,
to what do I owe the pleasure?

15:41.851 --> 15:44.687
Bad news, I'm afraid.

15:44.787 --> 15:47.354
One of yours.

15:48.223 --> 15:50.159
Apparently, she was doing social work

15:50.259 --> 15:53.361
for an American non-profit
in the <i>favelas.</i>

16:01.002 --> 16:03.737
You know her.

16:04.005 --> 16:04.874
Is she...

16:04.974 --> 16:06.242
Alive.

16:06.342 --> 16:08.310
Barely.

16:08.410 --> 16:11.411
She was found in the <i>favela.</i>

16:11.980 --> 16:14.884
Who the hell would do this?

16:14.984 --> 16:19.319
When you work with animals,
you're bound to get bit.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.976
Hello?

16:44.379 --> 16:45.947
What?

16:47.983 --> 16:50.486
When?

16:50.586 --> 16:52.822
What hospital?

16:52.922 --> 16:55.589
I'm on my way.

17:46.715 --> 17:49.376
- Thanks.
- Kuka.

17:49.978 --> 17:52.679
You heard about Cindy, yeah?

17:53.548 --> 17:56.650
You don't know anything
about that, do you?

17:58.753 --> 18:01.354
That's what I thought.

18:10.499 --> 18:12.334
You think they all lie.

18:12.434 --> 18:14.902
If the shoe fits on the other foot.

18:41.179 --> 18:42.279
These two go with me.

18:44.333 --> 18:45.367
Hey!

18:45.655 --> 18:47.419
Leave them alone.

18:48.437 --> 18:50.937
They did nothing!

18:53.242 --> 18:54.973
Of course.

18:55.875 --> 18:57.778
They're innocent lambs.

19:07.778 --> 19:10.031
Officer Da Silva.

19:10.331 --> 19:12.760
So glad you could join us.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.061
What?

19:15.457 --> 19:19.066
This is your favela. Your assignment.

19:20.401 --> 19:24.039
The same <i>favela</i> where an American
social worker, Cindy Chapman,

19:24.139 --> 19:26.408
was almost killed a few days ago?

19:26.508 --> 19:28.644
Do you have any witnesses?

19:28.744 --> 19:30.412
Any suspects?

19:30.512 --> 19:33.046
Any leads at all?

19:39.120 --> 19:41.088
Soda.

19:45.376 --> 19:46.509
Very useful.

19:48.395 --> 19:49.798
You're right.

19:49.898 --> 19:53.769
It's not gonna work.
The soda is too warm!

19:53.869 --> 19:56.837
We need ice.

19:57.177 --> 19:58.707
Paulo, get some ice.

20:13.721 --> 20:18.227
The department gave your
gentle approach a chance.

20:18.327 --> 20:21.263
One half-dead American later...

20:21.363 --> 20:24.030
It's time to do it my way.

20:44.318 --> 20:47.287
You made a lot of progress.

20:57.865 --> 21:01.100
Let's avoid a nasty scene here.

21:09.110 --> 21:11.913
I'll make you a deal.

21:12.013 --> 21:14.516
Your best fighter...

21:14.616 --> 21:17.550
against mine.

21:20.221 --> 21:24.426
If we win, we live to
fight another day.

21:24.526 --> 21:27.093
But if we win?

21:29.930 --> 21:34.535
We give you back all your stuff,
we let everyone go...

21:35.236 --> 21:37.770
and we never come back.

21:41.575 --> 21:43.876
A deal.

22:03.671 --> 22:05.546
Hey, man. Come over here.

22:09.485 --> 22:11.190
Don't be scared. Come here.

22:19.179 --> 22:20.967
Thiago, he's good.

22:23.840 --> 22:27.812
But let's see how big a man you
are when our back aren't turned.

22:29.792 --> 22:32.272
No matter what happens to me...

22:33.305 --> 22:35.433
this man is not to be arrested.

22:38.025 --> 22:39.371
Let's do this.

22:53.177 --> 22:54.194
Watch this.

23:10.554 --> 23:12.472
That all you got?

23:40.694 --> 23:43.398
So...

23:43.498 --> 23:45.133
We'll come back

23:45.233 --> 23:47.869
as often as necessary

23:47.969 --> 23:52.538
until we get whoever
attacked the American!

23:57.845 --> 24:00.148
And you.

24:00.248 --> 24:04.183
Don't forget whose side you're on.

24:10.958 --> 24:13.192
Thiago!

24:14.495 --> 24:16.796
I brought the ice!

24:55.903 --> 24:57.205
Manny.

24:57.305 --> 24:59.241
John.

24:59.341 --> 25:01.276
Nice suit.

25:01.376 --> 25:03.810
I see you stopped working out.

25:10.250 --> 25:11.853
Good seein' you, pal,

25:11.953 --> 25:14.990
under the circumstances.

25:15.090 --> 25:16.858
Wanna get something to eat?
You hungry?

25:16.958 --> 25:20.161
- No, I wanna go see my sister.
- That's what I figured.

25:20.261 --> 25:21.460
Come on.

25:50.391 --> 25:52.561
We've put her into an induced coma,

25:52.661 --> 25:56.629
giving her brain a chance to recover.

26:09.009 --> 26:11.177
John?

26:12.913 --> 26:15.181
John, you okay?

26:18.819 --> 26:20.221
Will she make it?

26:20.321 --> 26:21.957
I wish I could tell you.

26:22.057 --> 26:25.794
Given the extent of her wounds,
it's a miracle she made it this far.

26:25.894 --> 26:27.362
Hey, come on in.

26:27.462 --> 26:30.632
John, this is Detective Thiago.

26:30.732 --> 26:33.501
He's in charge of
investigating Cindy's case.

26:33.601 --> 26:37.438
I'm so sorry about
your sister, Mr. Chapman.

26:38.773 --> 26:43.244
The crime in the <i>favela</i> is very
terrible, especially recently.

26:43.344 --> 26:47.248
My men and I will do everything in
our power to find whoever did this.

26:47.348 --> 26:49.984
She was volunteering.
Why would someone attack her?

26:50.084 --> 26:51.713
The <i>favelados</i> see an American...

26:51.813 --> 26:53.853
- they see money.
- So, it was a robbery?

26:53.953 --> 26:57.391
Well, she was found without
the wallet, no cash, no jewelry.

26:57.491 --> 26:58.827
So, do you have any leads?

26:58.927 --> 27:02.197
We're questioning several known
criminals from the neighborhood.

27:02.297 --> 27:04.692
- We'll have something.
- Okay, look, it's been a long day,

27:04.792 --> 27:06.324
let's get you back to
the hotel for some rest.

27:06.424 --> 27:08.369
No, no no. I wanna go
where Cindy was found.

27:08.469 --> 27:10.905
With all due respect, Mr. Chapman,

27:11.005 --> 27:15.577
the <i>favela</i> isn't exactly
a tourist destination.

27:15.677 --> 27:18.579
Well, I'm not your regular tourist.

27:20.882 --> 27:22.117
Good, good, good.

27:22.217 --> 27:26.054
Let's, let's go.
Come on, come on, come on.

27:26.154 --> 27:28.988
Thank you, Detective.
We'll see you downstairs.

27:55.583 --> 28:00.321
It's a terrible thing,
all this violence in the <i>favela.</i>

28:00.421 --> 28:05.060
Just a couple of drug dealers
battling each other to...

28:05.160 --> 28:09.428
to sell more drugs to more
addicts in more areas.

28:12.265 --> 28:15.770
If they think you're on
the wrong side, bang.

28:15.870 --> 28:18.871
Right or wrong.

28:22.075 --> 28:24.145
Your sister is in God's hands now.

28:24.245 --> 28:26.214
I will pray for her.

28:26.314 --> 28:28.549
In my experience, all God's good for

28:28.649 --> 28:31.918
is giving people a reason
to kill each other.

28:34.554 --> 28:38.826
Better than killing each
other without a reason, no?

28:38.926 --> 28:40.926
That's for savages.

28:46.600 --> 28:50.169
Next generation, don't be fooled.

29:15.029 --> 29:18.333
Officer Da Silva,

29:18.433 --> 29:21.569
this is John Chapman,
the victim's brother.

29:21.669 --> 29:24.703
He would like to see the crime scene.

29:25.739 --> 29:29.943
Officer Da Silva is in charge
of the security of the <i>favela.</i>

29:31.646 --> 29:33.178
Whoa!

29:55.669 --> 29:57.005
Mr. Chapman,

29:57.105 --> 30:00.008
my sidearm, please.

30:00.108 --> 30:02.408
Are you alright?

30:04.878 --> 30:06.312
Jet lag.

30:09.649 --> 30:11.650
I should be heading back.

30:17.193 --> 30:20.586
Make sure he doesn't
cause any trouble.

30:25.565 --> 30:28.069
Follow me, Mr. Chapman.

30:28.169 --> 30:29.668
Please.

30:36.743 --> 30:38.379
There.

30:38.479 --> 30:41.714
One of the local children
found her just in time.

30:43.283 --> 30:46.487
Not the most secluded place, is it?

30:46.587 --> 30:48.790
Any witnesses?

30:48.890 --> 30:51.492
So far, no.

30:51.592 --> 30:52.794
Yeah, right.

30:52.894 --> 30:55.997
Nobody saw anything?

30:56.097 --> 31:00.268
The <i>favela</i> is a complicated
place, Mr. Chapman.

31:00.368 --> 31:04.472
Nothing complicated about a
slum controlled by drug dealers.

31:04.572 --> 31:06.905
Come with me.

31:19.586 --> 31:21.122
Look there.

31:21.222 --> 31:23.057
You see that clinic?

31:23.157 --> 31:26.861
It treats 250 people a day.

31:26.961 --> 31:29.330
Who do you think pays for that?

31:29.430 --> 31:31.566
I don't know, the government?

31:31.666 --> 31:34.435
The government forgot about
this place a long time ago.

31:34.535 --> 31:38.139
Day care, doctors, teachers.

31:38.239 --> 31:41.042
Drug money pays for all of it.

31:41.142 --> 31:42.844
The drug dealers take
care of the people here,

31:42.944 --> 31:45.780
and in exchange, the people
protect the drug dealers.

31:45.880 --> 31:48.983
Aren't drug dealers just wonderful?

31:49.083 --> 31:54.386
The world is rarely white and black, Mr.
Chapman, especially here in the <i>favela.</i>

32:18.011 --> 32:19.814
- Everything okay?
- Oh, yes.

32:19.914 --> 32:22.515
Time for her medication.

33:25.011 --> 33:26.447
Nurse!

33:26.547 --> 33:28.115
Nurse.

33:28.215 --> 33:30.148
Come back...

33:31.318 --> 33:35.287
Something's wrong.
It's my sister, she's convulsing.

33:42.027 --> 33:45.632
I need a 100 cc bag of norepinephrine
and Dr. Cristo in ICU 3, stat!

33:45.732 --> 33:48.202
How long has she been like this?

33:48.302 --> 33:51.172
Since right after the
nurse put meds in her IV.

33:51.272 --> 33:52.873
You saw someone inject her IV?

33:52.973 --> 33:56.441
Yeah, it was a nurse. She was Asian.

33:58.378 --> 34:00.481
- Who disconnected this?
- No, I-I didn't do that.

34:00.581 --> 34:03.315
I-It was like that when I came here.

34:07.621 --> 34:09.724
Get the IV going.

34:09.824 --> 34:12.860
Lorazepam going. B.P. dropping!

34:12.960 --> 34:14.793
- Get the paddles, stat!
- We're losing her!

34:26.306 --> 34:27.775
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

34:27.875 --> 34:30.110
There are no Asian
nurses on our staff.

34:30.210 --> 34:32.476
I'll talk to him.

34:35.782 --> 34:38.485
So, what'd they find out?
Who was she?

34:38.585 --> 34:41.954
Johnny, they said there's no
Asian nurses on the staff.

34:43.857 --> 34:46.625
You sure you saw her?

34:50.797 --> 34:53.534
- We'll get to the bottom of this.
- No, that's not good enough.

34:53.634 --> 34:56.969
We need a guard here at all
times to make sure she's safe.

35:00.373 --> 35:03.575
I'll have someone
here as of tomorrow.

35:04.711 --> 35:08.246
- Goodnight, gentlemen.
- Goodnight.

35:14.154 --> 35:17.456
- Catch you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

35:53.293 --> 35:55.127
Excuse me.

35:56.329 --> 35:58.130
Excuse me!

36:03.903 --> 36:05.439
Excuse me.

36:05.539 --> 36:08.275
Excuse me, do you speak English?

36:08.375 --> 36:10.344
Excuse me.

36:10.444 --> 36:13.679
Do you know this woman? Have you...

36:17.584 --> 36:20.452
Where'd you get that necklace?

36:21.454 --> 36:23.457
Necklace.

36:23.557 --> 36:26.024
Where did you get the necklace?

37:24.851 --> 37:27.288
Where did you get the necklace?

37:27.388 --> 37:28.289
Where...

37:28.389 --> 37:29.323
did you get...

37:29.423 --> 37:30.724
the necklace?

37:30.824 --> 37:34.028
Stop! Let him go!

37:34.128 --> 37:38.132
He's wearing Cindy's necklace.

37:38.232 --> 37:40.465
Now!

37:45.705 --> 37:48.607
What the hell are you doing?

37:49.976 --> 37:52.912
He's got on Cindy's necklace.

37:53.282 --> 37:54.438
Cindy's brother.

37:54.715 --> 37:56.050
This is Kuka.

37:56.150 --> 37:58.486
Cindy used to work with his sister,

37:58.586 --> 38:01.522
and she was killed a few days ago.

38:01.622 --> 38:04.724
Cindy gave him the
necklace as a gift.

38:12.398 --> 38:13.701
Maria.

38:13.801 --> 38:16.268
My sister.

38:18.938 --> 38:21.308
I'm sorry.

38:21.408 --> 38:24.109
My condolences.

38:39.560 --> 38:43.664
He says he wants to show
you something that he has.

38:43.764 --> 38:45.697
Let's go.

38:50.837 --> 38:53.738
I'm sorry.

39:05.886 --> 39:09.590
The pages were already
torn out when he found it.

39:09.690 --> 39:11.992
This is definitely Cindy's.

39:12.092 --> 39:14.795
Practically her whole
life was in this thing.

39:14.895 --> 39:16.797
Oh. No, no, no.

39:16.897 --> 39:19.266
You keep it.
She wanted you to have it.

39:19.366 --> 39:21.499
It's the least I can do.

39:25.104 --> 39:27.138
Thank you.

39:35.048 --> 39:37.885
So, what happened to Kuka's sister?

39:37.985 --> 39:39.286
We don't know.

39:39.386 --> 39:41.522
Her body hasn't been found.

39:41.622 --> 39:45.993
There have been a string of similar
occurrences all over town.

39:46.093 --> 39:48.362
All <i>favela</i> kids.

39:48.462 --> 39:51.599
Child prostitutes, mostly.

39:51.699 --> 39:55.069
So, if you haven't found the bodies,
how do you know they're dead?

39:55.169 --> 39:57.605
Around here,
when prostitutes disappear,

39:57.705 --> 40:00.140
there's only two places they end up.

40:00.240 --> 40:03.208
The ocean or the dump.

40:17.957 --> 40:19.691
What?

41:03.940 --> 41:06.434
You done with your recon?

41:07.746 --> 41:10.034
I'm starving.

41:10.634 --> 41:14.940
I could even eat your mother's
fat pussy, that's how hungry I am.

41:15.040 --> 41:18.359
That would be nice.
She needs to go out more.

41:18.659 --> 41:21.554
Don't think on having sex though.

41:21.654 --> 41:23.931
She doesn't screw
guys with small dicks.

41:35.087 --> 41:37.711
And here's the scum of the earth.

41:39.605 --> 41:42.109
- How much?
- 35.

41:42.209 --> 41:44.676
- Anal?
- 50.

41:48.286 --> 41:50.071
Don't move. Stay right there.

41:52.317 --> 41:53.292
Stay!

41:53.392 --> 41:56.295
So, you like little girls?

41:56.545 --> 41:57.576
Come here.

42:02.401 --> 42:05.738
For you. So you don't get in trouble.

42:06.138 --> 42:09.294
Next time, I'll arrest you.

42:19.592 --> 42:21.139
Time's up.

42:25.854 --> 42:27.864
Feel free to come back, asshole.

42:52.912 --> 42:55.346
<i>Obrigado.</i>

43:48.401 --> 43:51.704
Cindy's last appointment.

43:58.010 --> 43:59.880
<i>Hola, Bruno.</i>

43:59.980 --> 44:02.249
H-hello, Bruno. Hi.
This is John Chapman.

44:02.349 --> 44:04.585
I believe you know my sister,
Cindy Chapman?

44:04.685 --> 44:06.453
<i>O-okay?</i>

44:06.553 --> 44:08.689
Hey, listen, I-I need to...

44:08.789 --> 44:11.792
meet with you as soon as possible.

44:11.892 --> 44:12.993
Hello?

44:13.093 --> 44:14.461
You there?

44:14.561 --> 44:17.798
<i>Oh-okay. Okay...</i>

44:17.898 --> 44:19.333
<i>Not at night.</i>

44:19.433 --> 44:22.269
<i>My photo studio's on Via Colina.</i>

44:22.369 --> 44:27.074
<i>Meet me in the cafe outside,
tomorrow at, 7 AM.</i>

44:27.174 --> 44:29.877
<i>There'll be plenty of people there.</i>

44:29.977 --> 44:31.678
Okay, got it.

44:31.778 --> 44:33.146
See you there.

44:33.246 --> 44:35.013
Thank you.

44:44.924 --> 44:46.827
Oh, man.

44:46.927 --> 44:50.564
I've been so freaked out since
I've heard about Cindy.

44:50.664 --> 44:52.099
She's a great girl.

44:52.199 --> 44:54.268
I'm sorry.

44:54.368 --> 44:57.404
- How do you know Cindy?
- I'm a photographer.

44:57.504 --> 45:00.574
She convinced me to take photos
of the <i>favela,</i> you know,

45:00.674 --> 45:04.511
poor kids, but they can
use them to raise money.

45:04.611 --> 45:08.081
Is that why Cindy got hurt?

45:08.181 --> 45:09.881
No.

45:14.620 --> 45:19.159
Have you heard about the...
kid whores disappearing?

45:19.259 --> 45:21.386
You mean the children
from the <i>favela?</i> Yes.

45:21.486 --> 45:24.231
Yeah, yeah.
Everyone thinks they're dead,

45:24.331 --> 45:28.535
but your sister was convinced
that there's something going on.

45:28.635 --> 45:30.103
More than meets the eye.

45:30.203 --> 45:33.774
So, she started doing
her own investigation.

45:33.874 --> 45:36.043
Used her contacts in
the <i>favela,</i> you know,

45:36.143 --> 45:39.079
the charities, even the <i>polícia.</i>

45:39.179 --> 45:42.880
Last week, Cindy called...

45:48.921 --> 45:52.526
Cindy calls me excited,
gives me a place and a time.

45:52.626 --> 45:55.028
She had arranged a
meeting with someone

45:55.128 --> 45:58.198
that could blow this
whole thing wide open.

45:58.298 --> 46:03.303
Your sister had me hide and
take the pictures of the meeting.

46:03.403 --> 46:06.073
So, what did she find out?

46:06.173 --> 46:07.641
She didn't tell me.

46:07.741 --> 46:12.212
A-and I didn't come to find out.
I just take photos, you know?

46:12.312 --> 46:14.046
Did you go to the police?

46:16.816 --> 46:19.886
Listen to me, man.

46:19.986 --> 46:24.024
I really like your sister,
she is a good soul,

46:24.124 --> 46:26.059
but whosoever toes she stepped on,

46:26.159 --> 46:29.229
doesn't have a problem putting
people in the ground.

46:29.329 --> 46:34.001
So, I-I-I talk to you,
but now, I'm done. 'Kay?

46:34.101 --> 46:35.936
So, where are the photos?

46:36.036 --> 46:39.106
I-I gave them to Cindy,
the originals.

46:39.206 --> 46:41.108
Can I have the copies?

46:41.208 --> 46:42.809
No.

46:42.909 --> 46:45.610
They're my insurance.

46:46.645 --> 46:50.017
Okay, well, thanks for your time.

46:50.117 --> 46:52.352
No <i>problema.</i>

46:52.452 --> 46:53.820
Hey. Listen, man,

46:53.920 --> 46:58.892
I appreciate the fact that Cindy
had friends like you in her corner.

46:58.992 --> 47:00.527
You understand?

47:00.627 --> 47:02.694
Means a lot to me.

47:03.462 --> 47:06.564
- Okay.
- Thank you.

49:27.573 --> 49:29.508
Well, that must be the
guy she was meeting.

49:31.077 --> 49:33.480
Yeah, looks like a model citizen.

49:33.580 --> 49:36.016
I'll print 'em out for you,
but it doesn't give you much.

49:36.116 --> 49:36.983
Tats.

49:37.083 --> 49:40.987
The guys who shot at me had these...
elaborate tattoos, full sleeves.

49:41.087 --> 49:42.856
You know, like the
Asian gangster movies?

49:42.956 --> 49:45.025
Yakuza?

49:45.125 --> 49:47.260
- Yeah, but here?
- Well, don't write 'em off.

49:47.360 --> 49:50.230
Brazil has the largest Japanese
population outside of Japan.

49:50.330 --> 49:53.898
Yakuza, they lie low, but they've
been here since the '70s,

49:53.998 --> 49:56.335
and they have no problem
partnering up with local gangs

49:56.435 --> 49:58.399
that will service their needs.

49:59.939 --> 50:02.676
Hey, stop. Back up.

50:02.776 --> 50:04.644
Right there.

50:04.744 --> 50:07.747
Now zoom in. Right there, stop.

50:07.847 --> 50:09.914
Go to the right.

50:11.517 --> 50:13.220
What's that say? Ronos?

50:13.320 --> 50:14.688
Kronos.

50:14.788 --> 50:17.991
Oh, that's a local nightclub.
I know where that is.

50:18.091 --> 50:19.326
Wait a second, I'll take you there.

50:19.426 --> 50:21.628
No, no, no. I cannot get
you mixed up in all this.

50:21.728 --> 50:23.730
Look, you've pulled my ass out
of the fire more than once.

50:23.830 --> 50:25.365
Least I can do is be your chauffeur.

50:25.465 --> 50:27.034
Besides, with someone watching you,

50:27.134 --> 50:29.435
shit will stop blowing
up in this city.

52:19.044 --> 52:21.379
VIP only.

52:47.873 --> 52:49.908
The hell you looking at?

52:55.015 --> 52:57.215
Do you know her?

52:58.150 --> 52:59.052
No.

52:59.152 --> 53:00.820
I know you know her,
and I know you met her.

53:00.920 --> 53:03.390
Make it easier on
yourself and tell me why.

53:03.490 --> 53:05.926
I-I don't remember.

53:06.026 --> 53:08.125
Oh, you don't remember?

53:08.927 --> 53:10.262
You know what?

53:11.498 --> 53:13.800
You didn't wash your hands.

53:13.900 --> 53:15.035
That's nasty.

53:15.135 --> 53:17.535
Let me teach you some hygiene.

53:18.170 --> 53:19.604
No!

53:27.212 --> 53:28.648
Remember her now?

53:28.748 --> 53:32.651
- She was just some <i>puta</i> I met.
- Oh, man, that's my sister.

53:39.224 --> 53:41.226
Any better?

53:42.827 --> 53:44.729
Okay.

54:00.446 --> 54:04.117
- Okay.
- No! Wait! I'll tell you! I'll tell you.

54:04.217 --> 54:06.453
S-some big mouthed <i>favelado</i>

54:06.553 --> 54:07.988
told her about my...

54:08.088 --> 54:09.389
services.

54:09.489 --> 54:11.358
What services?

54:11.458 --> 54:15.095
- Import, export.
- Smuggling.

54:15.195 --> 54:17.497
She started following me.

54:17.597 --> 54:21.501
She saw me make an arrangement with one
of my clients and confronted me about it.

54:21.601 --> 54:22.802
She shouldn't have done that.

54:22.902 --> 54:24.671
No! W-wait! I didn't
do anything to her!

54:24.771 --> 54:27.474
I didn't touch her. I didn't have to.

54:27.574 --> 54:31.144
My client had people there watching.

54:31.244 --> 54:36.249
They saw everything. Her,
the guy in the car, everything.

54:36.349 --> 54:40.120
Who's your client?

54:40.220 --> 54:41.955
Hey, man, the pool's still open.

54:42.055 --> 54:43.789
Okay, okay.

54:45.325 --> 54:47.661
Head out of town. Go northwest.

54:47.761 --> 54:49.396
Th-there's a small dirt road

54:49.496 --> 54:53.266
25 kilometers after <i>Volta
Redonda</i> that leads to hacienda.

54:53.366 --> 54:55.402
My client owns the place.

54:55.502 --> 54:58.004
Okay, but if I find out
you're lying to me,

54:58.104 --> 55:01.206
I'm gonna come back and
finish your swimming lesson.

55:16.989 --> 55:19.357
Okay, ladies!

55:25.330 --> 55:27.100
Today,

55:27.200 --> 55:30.503
we take back the <i>favela.</i>

55:30.603 --> 55:35.809
An American social worker went
there trying to do good things...

55:35.909 --> 55:37.744
and thanks to the animals,

55:37.844 --> 55:41.815
she's in the hospital,
fighting for her life.

55:41.915 --> 55:43.183
It's a shame...

55:43.283 --> 55:47.187
that's what it took to
get our bosses' attention.

55:47.287 --> 55:49.289
But no matter.

55:49.389 --> 55:53.226
Your targets are the
pillars of the drug trade,

55:53.326 --> 55:56.463
the sex trade, the murder.

55:56.563 --> 56:01.832
Take them down, and this
whole mess falls apart.

56:03.268 --> 56:06.673
We're doing God's work...

56:06.773 --> 56:10.210
so no shame.

56:10.310 --> 56:12.379
No guilt.

56:12.479 --> 56:14.948
No pity.

56:15.048 --> 56:18.485
Just... put them in the ground!

56:18.585 --> 56:20.052
So let's go!

56:23.156 --> 56:25.892
Go, go, go, go, go!

56:25.992 --> 56:28.294
Give me all the intel you
have on this <i>hacienda</i> place.

56:28.394 --> 56:29.596
We're on our way there now.

56:29.696 --> 56:32.430
Just, tell 'em to make it fast.

56:33.599 --> 56:35.535
What do you got?

56:35.635 --> 56:37.704
Looks like... just...

56:37.804 --> 56:40.304
- ...shipping manifests.
- Let me see.

56:43.909 --> 56:47.845
My favorite smuggler DJ, Mr. Lima.

56:50.749 --> 56:53.753
Shit. These are fake.

56:53.853 --> 56:57.256
It's already got the customs stamp,
but check out the departure date.

57:01.760 --> 57:03.494
Shit.

57:49.673 --> 57:51.109
Amen.

58:20.306 --> 58:22.408
Wow, we should check this place out.

58:22.508 --> 58:24.677
Oh, I'm sure it's all totally legit.

58:24.777 --> 58:27.380
What's the plan?

58:27.480 --> 58:30.183
I go in. You go back home.

58:30.283 --> 58:32.585
Besides, you need to be
to work soon anyway.

58:32.685 --> 58:36.388
Sure you don't want me to come in
there and save your ass as usual?

59:30.609 --> 59:32.312
Welcome.

59:32.412 --> 59:34.245
What's your pleasure?

59:35.414 --> 59:37.984
I don't know.
It's my first time here.

59:38.084 --> 59:39.385
Lucky you.

59:39.485 --> 59:43.554
Please, take a seat,
and we'll be with you shortly.

01:00:19.853 --> 01:00:22.152
Check out the bar.

01:00:29.821 --> 01:00:32.262
Should I tell Hirimoto?

01:00:33.439 --> 01:00:37.341
Hirimoto is not to be disturbed.
We can handle it.

01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:44.324
We have an unwanted guest.

01:00:49.821 --> 01:00:51.890
Sir, this way, please.

01:01:18.825 --> 01:01:22.718
- Status update.
- Area 1 secure.

01:01:23.296 --> 01:01:26.344
- Area 3 secure.
- Excellent.

01:01:27.002 --> 01:01:29.729
- Double check the list.
- Copy that.

01:01:36.034 --> 01:01:38.068
Have a seat.

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:56.453
Maria. My sister.

01:03:37.322 --> 01:03:39.057
Freeze!

01:03:41.159 --> 01:03:42.995
Down! Down!

01:03:43.095 --> 01:03:45.231
Down!

01:03:45.331 --> 01:03:46.731
Officer requesting backup.

01:03:48.668 --> 01:03:50.336
<i>Officer requesting backup.</i>

01:03:50.436 --> 01:03:53.239
<i>Location: favela northwest,
cul-de-sac.</i>

01:03:53.339 --> 01:03:55.775
<i>Asian man, mid-to-late
30s in custody.</i>

01:03:55.875 --> 01:03:57.443
<i>Suspect is not on list.</i>

01:03:57.543 --> 01:03:58.978
Copy.

01:03:59.078 --> 01:04:01.681
Santo and Bororo on the way.

01:04:01.781 --> 01:04:04.684
All other units, hold positions.

01:04:04.784 --> 01:04:07.718
Repeat, hold position.

01:04:12.123 --> 01:04:13.759
Okay, what's going on?

01:04:13.859 --> 01:04:16.362
Sir, I saw suspicious activity.

01:04:16.462 --> 01:04:18.231
Upon pursuit, I found these two men

01:04:18.331 --> 01:04:20.233
loading children into
the van at gunpoint.

01:04:20.333 --> 01:04:22.969
I disarmed them and radioed in.

01:04:23.069 --> 01:04:25.369
Good job.

01:04:38.917 --> 01:04:41.518
Is this gun registered?

01:04:44.289 --> 01:04:45.923
Good.

01:04:47.292 --> 01:04:49.326
Good.

01:05:24.095 --> 01:05:26.563
Our price just doubled.

01:05:33.371 --> 01:05:36.275
What's going on here?
Where are the manifests?

01:05:36.375 --> 01:05:37.743
The plan's changed.

01:05:37.843 --> 01:05:40.012
Did you take care of our loose ends?

01:05:40.112 --> 01:05:41.981
The American girl?

01:05:42.081 --> 01:05:44.717
Everyone she could
have talked to is dead.

01:05:44.817 --> 01:05:45.785
<i>Good.</i>

01:05:45.885 --> 01:05:49.253
<i>Your money will be
waiting at the docks.</i>

01:06:08.629 --> 01:06:11.910
Officer down. Repeat, officer down.

01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:14.116
Requesting medical assistance.

01:06:35.116 --> 01:06:37.128
Our unwanted guest is on the loose.

01:06:38.198 --> 01:06:41.371
Intruder on the premises.
Sweep the grounds.

01:07:14.722 --> 01:07:16.995
I thought I made it clear that
I was not to be disturbed.

01:07:17.095 --> 01:07:20.481
I'm sorry, Hirimoto,
but we have a situation...

01:07:21.195 --> 01:07:24.365
The American. He's here.
And proving difficult to kill.

01:07:24.865 --> 01:07:26.972
He has the manifests.

01:07:27.072 --> 01:07:29.395
Clear out the merchandise.
And the guests.

01:07:29.595 --> 01:07:32.408
And why don't you pay
a visit to the hospital?

01:07:32.508 --> 01:07:34.323
Yes, Hirimoto.

01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:57.516
Yes?

01:07:57.616 --> 01:08:01.787
<i>The American is causing trouble</i>
at my place of business.

01:08:01.887 --> 01:08:04.022
I'll take care of it.

01:08:14.265 --> 01:08:16.734
I'm sorry about the manifests.

01:08:16.835 --> 01:08:18.470
He-he surprised me.

01:08:18.571 --> 01:08:21.270
I-It won't happen again.

01:08:41.993 --> 01:08:44.895
Mr. Lima.

01:08:49.801 --> 01:08:53.005
I don't care for guns.

01:08:53.104 --> 01:08:55.741
Moving parts.

01:08:55.841 --> 01:08:58.707
Different materials.

01:08:59.844 --> 01:09:03.447
So... dirty.

01:09:07.452 --> 01:09:10.923
Now this...

01:09:11.023 --> 01:09:14.157
is Tamahagane.

01:09:20.465 --> 01:09:23.733
Jewel steel.

01:09:25.737 --> 01:09:28.004
Pure.

01:09:32.477 --> 01:09:36.546
It can cut through anything.

01:09:48.091 --> 01:09:51.228
Like a middleman.

01:10:39.823 --> 01:10:44.521
All units, all units. Disturbance at La
Hacienda Resort. 323 Santiago Street.

01:10:44.621 --> 01:10:48.669
Gunshots reported.
Units requested. Use caution.

01:12:02.994 --> 01:12:04.330
Mr. Chapman?

01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:05.998
What are you doing here?

01:12:06.098 --> 01:12:08.467
These are the men who attacked Cindy.

01:12:08.567 --> 01:12:11.670
Which ones? All of them?

01:12:11.770 --> 01:12:14.707
They had something to do with it.

01:12:14.807 --> 01:12:16.308
Katarina!

01:12:16.408 --> 01:12:20.746
Maria, Kuka's sister, she's here,
I saw her. She's downstairs.

01:12:20.846 --> 01:12:24.314
- What's going on?
- I'll show you. Follow me.

01:12:57.882 --> 01:12:59.251
She was here.

01:12:59.351 --> 01:13:01.687
There were children,
there were people...

01:13:01.787 --> 01:13:04.120
Look.

01:13:05.022 --> 01:13:08.625
Counterfeit shipping manifests.

01:13:15.066 --> 01:13:17.500
They're tryin' to smuggle
the children out.

01:13:18.970 --> 01:13:22.007
Mr. Chapman, why don't you
give me Mr. Lima's briefcase?

01:13:22.107 --> 01:13:25.508
We'll handle it from here.

01:13:32.717 --> 01:13:34.184
Thank you.

01:13:35.019 --> 01:13:36.455
Da Silva,

01:13:36.555 --> 01:13:40.025
take Mr. Chapman to the hotel.

01:13:40.125 --> 01:13:42.926
We'll go check out the docks.

01:14:05.049 --> 01:14:08.153
<i>Mr. Chapman, Why don't you
give me Mr. Lima's briefcase?</i>

01:14:08.253 --> 01:14:10.653
<i>We'll handle it from here.</i>

01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:18.461
Go make sure my sister's okay.

01:14:19.163 --> 01:14:20.797
Please.

01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:42.581
Oh, yeah, I forgot...

01:15:42.681 --> 01:15:46.784
Freeze. Police. All that stuff.

01:17:20.449 --> 01:17:21.838
- Hello?
- Manny, it's me...

01:17:21.938 --> 01:17:23.749
I found the girls,
the missing <i>favela</i> kids.

01:17:23.849 --> 01:17:26.051
The Yakuza are shipping
'em off to Japan.

01:17:26.151 --> 01:17:28.453
Jesus. All right, where are ya?

01:17:28.553 --> 01:17:30.555
At the, dock.

01:17:30.655 --> 01:17:33.258
Porto Del Rio. Dock 9.

01:17:33.358 --> 01:17:34.826
Dock 9, I know where
that is. I got it.

01:17:34.926 --> 01:17:36.261
Listen, get the cops over here.

01:17:36.361 --> 01:17:40.499
Tell them, "Do not radio it in."
Thiago's dirty.

01:17:40.599 --> 01:17:43.633
All right, wait a second, what are
you gonna do till they get there?

01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:47.203
Take in the scenery.

01:17:49.273 --> 01:17:51.874
I was afraid of that.

01:17:52.576 --> 01:17:53.943
Shit.

01:18:04.369 --> 01:18:06.173
I think the American is...

01:18:08.873 --> 01:18:11.473
Hello? What's going on?

01:18:11.773 --> 01:18:13.497
What's going on?

01:18:18.251 --> 01:18:22.162
Send everyone. Take him down!

01:18:25.242 --> 01:18:27.179
We'll take care of it.

01:18:27.279 --> 01:18:29.379
Detective.

01:18:32.283 --> 01:18:34.953
Please forgive my skepticism,

01:18:35.053 --> 01:18:37.487
but I think I'll join.

01:26:53.929 --> 01:26:57.198
You put up a better
fight than your sister.

01:27:43.211 --> 01:27:45.781
It's funny...

01:27:45.881 --> 01:27:48.050
how things work out.

01:27:48.150 --> 01:27:49.950
Right?

01:28:12.441 --> 01:28:14.176
In my locker...

01:28:14.276 --> 01:28:15.912
at the station,

01:28:16.012 --> 01:28:17.446
there is a...

01:28:17.546 --> 01:28:19.849
a list of people.

01:28:19.949 --> 01:28:22.652
Everyone Hirimoto's got on the take.

01:28:22.752 --> 01:28:25.721
The police, the courts,

01:28:25.821 --> 01:28:27.455
the government.

01:28:31.059 --> 01:28:32.762
Give it to Katarina.

01:28:32.862 --> 01:28:35.697
She will make it right.

01:28:39.367 --> 01:28:41.537
I was the first in my family...

01:28:41.637 --> 01:28:44.504
to reach 45.

01:28:46.875 --> 01:28:50.480
Most of my family still
live in the <i>favela.</i>

01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:54.116
And I was going to get us out.

01:28:54.216 --> 01:28:56.284
But...

01:28:57.853 --> 01:29:01.424
such is the will of God.

01:29:01.524 --> 01:29:06.493
God has nothin' to do with this.
You made your own choices.

01:29:12.267 --> 01:29:15.938
I didn't attack your sister, I swear.

01:29:16.038 --> 01:29:20.575
I may be a sinner, but not a savage.

01:29:33.121 --> 01:29:35.959
My judgment is near.

01:29:37.059 --> 01:29:39.328
Do you still have one round...

01:29:39.428 --> 01:29:41.629
in that gun?

01:31:38.613 --> 01:31:40.481
Hey.

01:31:54.429 --> 01:31:57.266
She's just exhausted.

01:31:57.366 --> 01:32:01.571
Even the tiniest effort is
monumental for her right now.

01:32:01.671 --> 01:32:04.273
How long till she's back on her feet?

01:32:04.373 --> 01:32:08.711
Well, Mr. Chapman, there's
something you need to understand.

01:32:08.811 --> 01:32:12.148
The injuries your sister
suffered were very extensive,

01:32:12.248 --> 01:32:15.284
including severe head trauma.

01:32:15.384 --> 01:32:18.254
It's going to be a long, slow process

01:32:18.354 --> 01:32:22.391
for her to get back to
functioning by herself.

01:32:22.491 --> 01:32:25.792
We're talking about
a matter of years.

01:32:43.044 --> 01:32:45.448
Hi, coffee? Black, please.

01:32:45.548 --> 01:32:48.517
Whiskey neat. Make it a double.

01:32:48.617 --> 01:32:51.621
- It's nine in the morning.
- Yeah, you're right.

01:32:51.721 --> 01:32:54.423
Excuse me, make that a single.

01:32:54.523 --> 01:32:56.156
Nice.

01:32:57.392 --> 01:33:02.064
Look, John, you saved
dozens of kids from hell.

01:33:02.164 --> 01:33:04.000
Manny, I...

01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:06.402
It's funny, I thought I'd feel
better once I got these guys,

01:33:06.502 --> 01:33:08.437
but seein' Cindy like
that today, man...

01:33:08.537 --> 01:33:10.072
Stop. Stop.

01:33:10.172 --> 01:33:12.875
You can't think like that.

01:33:12.975 --> 01:33:16.312
You're gonna destroy yourself.

01:33:16.412 --> 01:33:21.448
So, how 'bout... Uncle Manny gives
you something else to destroy?

01:33:22.984 --> 01:33:25.354
See, me and some of the higher-ups
at the State Department

01:33:25.454 --> 01:33:27.223
are always thinking,
"Man, wouldn't it be nice

01:33:27.323 --> 01:33:30.459
to have someone to get the job
done when no one else can?"

01:33:30.559 --> 01:33:33.629
- Isn't that what the CIA is for?
- Come on, their plate's full.

01:33:33.729 --> 01:33:35.631
Between China and the Middle East,

01:33:35.731 --> 01:33:39.168
tryin' to run anything through
that bureaucracy? Forget about it.

01:33:39.268 --> 01:33:41.237
Thank you.

01:33:41.337 --> 01:33:45.341
No, what I'm thinking about is
something a little less official.

01:33:45.441 --> 01:33:48.545
I don't know, man.
My head's still messed up.

01:33:49.145 --> 01:33:52.281
But there is also one other
thing you have to consider,

01:33:52.381 --> 01:33:54.483
Cindy's condition.

01:33:54.583 --> 01:33:58.521
Those medical bills are going
to pile up for years to come.

01:33:58.621 --> 01:33:59.956
What are you gettin' at?

01:34:00.056 --> 01:34:01.824
Come on, man, she doesn't
have any insurance.

01:34:01.924 --> 01:34:03.292
I've been running those
bills through the Embassy.

01:34:03.392 --> 01:34:06.095
How long you think that's gonna last?

01:34:06.195 --> 01:34:11.167
However, if she were a dependent
of a government agent, well...

01:34:11.267 --> 01:34:13.737
That's a whole different ball game.

01:34:14.837 --> 01:34:16.872
So, you're sayin', if I take the job,

01:34:16.972 --> 01:34:19.541
you'll make sure
Cindy's taken care of?

01:34:22.844 --> 01:34:26.513
- But, what if I don't?
- There's only so much I can do.

01:34:47.869 --> 01:34:50.203
When do I start?

01:34:54.442 --> 01:34:56.977
You already did.

01:34:58.513 --> 01:35:00.515
It's your old call sign.
