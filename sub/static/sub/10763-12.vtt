WEBVTT

00:09.109 --> 00:11.244
Well, Morrie, if you're
not cheating on your wife,

00:11.244 --> 00:12.679
and she still suspects you,

00:12.679 --> 00:15.148
then we're obviously dealing
with a trust issue.

00:15.148 --> 00:16.274
MORRIE:
More like a crazy issue.

00:16.783 --> 00:18.614
And I know where she gets it--
from her mother.

00:19.119 --> 00:20.620
Who, by the way,
came for Thanksgiving

00:20.620 --> 00:22.122
and still hasn't left.

00:22.122 --> 00:23.612
Happy New Year.

00:24.057 --> 00:26.059
Perhaps we should tackle
these issues one at a time.

00:26.059 --> 00:27.060
(knocking on door)

00:27.060 --> 00:28.428
I'm in the bathroom, Celeste.

00:28.428 --> 00:29.429
A little privacy?

00:29.429 --> 00:30.418
You see how she gets?

00:31.131 --> 00:32.131
Well, perhaps
what is needed here is a...

00:32.131 --> 00:33.366
CELESTE:
You think I don't know

00:33.366 --> 00:35.068
who you're in there
talking to, Morrie?

00:35.068 --> 00:36.369
It's your little whore,
isn't it?

00:36.369 --> 00:38.805
Hello, whore.

00:38.805 --> 00:41.775
Celeste, if I could interrupt
for just a moment...

00:41.775 --> 00:43.276
A man?! It's worse
than I thought!

00:43.276 --> 00:45.111
WOMAN 2:
Celeste!

00:45.111 --> 00:47.113
CELESTE:
Hang up, Ma.

00:47.113 --> 00:48.481
MA:
You're all on the radio.

00:48.481 --> 00:50.176
I'm listening in the kitchen
.

00:50.450 --> 00:53.253
MORRIE:
How about washing a dish or two
while you're down there?

00:53.253 --> 00:54.654
GIRL:
I cannot stand this yelling.

00:54.654 --> 00:56.189
I'm running away from home!

00:56.189 --> 00:57.457
MORRIE:
Hang up the phone, Britney.

00:57.457 --> 00:59.425
You're going nowhere.

01:00.126 --> 01:03.095
And neither
is this conversation.

01:03.296 --> 01:04.786
Well, that's
our show for today,

01:05.298 --> 01:06.800
with a brief program note.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.803
My KACL colleagues and I
are competing

01:09.803 --> 01:11.671
against a team at KPXY

01:11.671 --> 01:15.175
to see who can shed
the most pounds for charity.

01:15.175 --> 01:17.473
We're off to our
first weigh-in right now.

01:17.844 --> 01:19.345
You can keep track
of our progress

01:19.345 --> 01:21.347
on Channel 6's
Coffee With Kelly.

01:21.347 --> 01:22.816
Wish us luck.

01:22.816 --> 01:25.852
Okay, everybody.
Iet's power this crap down.

01:25.852 --> 01:26.853
Why?

01:26.853 --> 01:28.343
The more you eat
before the contest,

01:28.855 --> 01:30.846
the more you artificially
boost your starting weight.

01:31.357 --> 01:33.760
We got cheeseburgers,
doughnuts, french fries, tacos.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.763
And a duck confit
that's as rich as Donald Trump

01:36.763 --> 01:38.198
and twice as greasy.

01:38.198 --> 01:41.701
Well, it hardly seems in the
spirit of the competition.

01:41.701 --> 01:44.192
The entire premise here
is to raise awareness

01:44.704 --> 01:46.706
about the obesity epidemic in this country.

01:46.706 --> 01:48.196
Come on, Frasier.

01:48.641 --> 01:50.199
The winning team
gets a free trip to Vegas!

01:50.710 --> 01:52.612
(all cheering)

01:52.612 --> 01:54.848
Four glorious days
in Sin City,

01:54.848 --> 01:56.850
with all its
gaudy brilliance--

01:56.850 --> 02:00.353
the feathered headdresses,
the fishnet stockings...

02:00.353 --> 02:03.220
I'm just wearing an aloha shirt, myself.

02:03.523 --> 02:05.491
Come on, Shempsky,
pick up the pace.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.360
I have a digestive disorder

02:07.360 --> 02:09.362
where if I eat too much
or too little,

02:09.362 --> 02:11.364
I get incapacitating
stomach cramps.

02:11.364 --> 02:13.730
ROZ:
It's okay, Noel.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.269
You do what's
right for you.

02:16.269 --> 02:19.272
But wouldn't
a trip to Vegas
be really fun?

02:19.272 --> 02:23.276
And remember, what
happens in Vegas...

02:23.276 --> 02:25.267
stays in Vegas.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.481
Eat up, Doc.

02:28.481 --> 02:29.482
I will do
no such thing.

02:29.482 --> 02:32.185
It's not fair, and it
is unsportsmanlike.

02:32.185 --> 02:33.486
Aw, who's it going to hurt?

02:33.486 --> 02:35.488
(screaming)

02:35.488 --> 02:37.183
Shake it off, kid.

02:37.490 --> 02:38.479
Nobody likes a whiner.

02:44.264 --> 02:47.199
(doorbell rings)

02:48.434 --> 02:49.936
Hey, Niles, Daph.

02:49.936 --> 02:51.437
No time for chitchat.

02:51.437 --> 02:52.426
Pregnant lady
coming through.

02:54.941 --> 02:55.930
What happened
to your wrist?

02:56.442 --> 02:57.443
Oh, uh...

02:57.443 --> 03:01.447
she rolled over in her sleep
and pinned me again.

03:01.447 --> 03:02.937
I even saw it
coming this time,

03:03.449 --> 03:05.940
Iike the big rock in
that Indiana Jones movie.

03:06.452 --> 03:07.453
Does she know she did it?

03:07.453 --> 03:08.681
No, no.

03:08.955 --> 03:10.523
I didn't want
to hurt her feelings,

03:10.523 --> 03:13.226
so I just... I just,
uh... made up an excuse...

03:13.226 --> 03:14.527
What is Eddie doing?

03:14.527 --> 03:17.530
Oh, he's waiting for
a pigeon friend of his.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.225
We call him Barney.

03:19.332 --> 03:23.303
Flies on the balcony every day,
and they stare at each other.

03:23.303 --> 03:24.537
Those crazy animals.

03:24.537 --> 03:26.232
Yesterday, they did
it for three hours.

03:26.539 --> 03:26.903
(scoffs)

03:27.307 --> 03:28.374
No, I'm not making it up.

03:28.374 --> 03:30.239
I watched them the whole time.

03:33.580 --> 03:35.673
Oh, is your wrist
still bothering you, dear?

03:36.282 --> 03:37.350
Oh, just
a little flare-up.

03:37.350 --> 03:39.352
Oh, poor thing
slept on it funny.

03:39.352 --> 03:40.649
Woke up screaming
like a dying rabbit.

03:44.791 --> 03:46.292
Hey, Fras.

03:46.292 --> 03:47.293
How was the weigh-in?

03:47.293 --> 03:48.726
It was appalling, thank you.

03:49.429 --> 03:51.727
My teammates ridiculed me
for not pigging out beforehand.

03:52.432 --> 03:53.967
You know, what is it about teams

03:53.967 --> 03:56.769
and competitions that just
brings out the worst in people?

03:56.769 --> 03:57.937
Here we go again.

03:57.937 --> 03:59.772
What?

03:59.772 --> 04:02.275
Well, Frasier and team sports
are not a happy mix.

04:02.275 --> 04:04.777
Freshman year,
in a bid to please Dad

04:04.777 --> 04:06.642
There is no need
to tell that story

04:06.913 --> 04:10.849
Frasier inadvertently joined 
the girls' field hockey team.

04:12.685 --> 04:16.389
The sign-up sheet said,
"F. Hockey"

04:16.389 --> 04:18.687
I assumed it meant
"freshman" hockey.

04:19.291 --> 04:22.318
The little plaid skirt
didn't tip you off?

04:23.496 --> 04:25.794
I thought it was a kilt!

04:28.701 --> 04:29.702
Well, I'm starving.

04:29.702 --> 04:31.704
Where shall we
go for dinner?

04:31.704 --> 04:33.072
(thump)
What was that?

04:33.072 --> 04:34.340
(gasps) Barney!

04:34.340 --> 04:36.342
Daph, would you take
Eddie to my room?

04:36.342 --> 04:37.639
I don't want him to see this.

04:38.344 --> 04:39.345
Come on, boy.
Come on.

04:39.345 --> 04:40.647
Oh, how did
this happen?

04:40.647 --> 04:42.012
Oh, now, Dad, birds
do fly into windows.

04:42.415 --> 04:46.010
I know. That's why I keep
a safety smudge right there.

04:46.486 --> 04:47.475
Where did it go?

04:49.656 --> 04:51.351
Niles...

04:53.359 --> 04:54.656
I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.

04:55.361 --> 04:56.385
It... it's a reflex.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.688
I... I... I don't
even know I'm doing it.

05:02.602 --> 05:03.694
Are you happy?

05:04.370 --> 05:06.372
You killed Eddie's
little friend.

05:06.372 --> 05:07.669
Poor little guy.

05:09.609 --> 05:11.941
What should we do,
just kick him over the edge?

05:12.378 --> 05:14.505
Dad, wait.
He's still breathing.

05:14.781 --> 05:15.848
Oh! Then pick him up.

05:15.848 --> 05:18.451
But birds are notorious
carriers of disease.

05:18.451 --> 05:19.418
Oh, here. Use my hankie.

05:19.686 --> 05:21.454
I'll take my chances.

05:21.454 --> 05:23.756
Oh, don't you quit
on us, Barney.

05:23.756 --> 05:26.350
You're going
to be good as new.

05:32.432 --> 05:36.425
See? That's why we
need a safety smudge.

05:38.471 --> 05:39.739
We'll be right back

05:39.739 --> 05:42.442
to see how our teams
are doing in the first week

05:42.442 --> 05:44.711
of our Fat to Fit
Weight Loss Challenge,

05:44.711 --> 05:46.406
so stay right here.

05:47.413 --> 05:49.074
Hey, look. It's them.

05:49.382 --> 05:51.451
ROZ: Oh, those robes!

05:51.451 --> 05:53.885
Makes them look like
they're in some kind of cult.

05:54.420 --> 05:58.686
Like the high priests
of Asmodeus the Destroyer.

05:59.025 --> 06:03.860
Asmodeus-- demon of lust,
eater of worlds.

06:04.397 --> 06:08.060
Does nobody read my e-mails?

06:08.568 --> 06:09.432
KELLY: Welcome back.

06:09.869 --> 06:12.572
So let's see how our teams
fared this week.

06:12.572 --> 06:13.561
Come on in, guys!

06:13.806 --> 06:16.809
Come on in!
Okay.

06:16.809 --> 06:18.606
Kenny, who's that
last guy on their team?

06:18.711 --> 06:19.779
Oh, Wayne Shafter.

06:19.779 --> 06:21.644
He's the new
general manager.

06:21.914 --> 06:25.518
So...
we meet again...

06:25.518 --> 06:27.820
Wayne Shafter.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.422
You know him?

06:29.422 --> 06:30.990
We went to high
school together.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.992
He was the captain
of the football team--

06:32.992 --> 06:34.494
Mr. Popularity--
and my chief rival

06:34.494 --> 06:36.996
for the affections of our
Swedish exchange student,

06:36.996 --> 06:38.588
Giselle Johannson-Jansen.

06:39.766 --> 06:42.132
Yeah? So, how
did that work out?

06:42.535 --> 06:45.538
Great. We got married
and had six kids.

06:45.538 --> 06:46.835
What do you think?

06:49.175 --> 06:51.177
Wayne Shafter?

06:51.177 --> 06:52.178
Yeah?

06:52.178 --> 06:53.577
Frasier Crane.

06:53.846 --> 06:56.815
Hey, F. Hockey!

06:58.684 --> 07:00.174
What have you
been up to?

07:00.686 --> 07:01.948
Oh, you know, not much.

07:02.188 --> 07:03.423
Harvard, Oxford,
M.D., PhD.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.757
And then,
just recently--

07:04.757 --> 07:05.746
Hey, remember
that time

07:06.426 --> 07:08.417
I took your chess set
and made you cry?

07:08.528 --> 07:10.096
You did not
make me cry.

07:10.096 --> 07:13.599
I chose to cry as a tactic
to elicit sympathy

07:13.599 --> 07:15.863
and thereby regain
my chess set.

07:16.102 --> 07:19.071
I threw it in the Dumpster
behind the cafeteria, didn't I?

07:19.439 --> 07:21.066
I don't know.
It was never found.

07:21.474 --> 07:23.874
No, I did.

07:24.177 --> 07:25.445
And last up for KACL,

07:25.445 --> 07:27.747
my old friend,
Dr. Frasier Crane.

07:27.747 --> 07:28.748
Hi, Kelly.

07:28.748 --> 07:30.739
Hey, Fras.
Good to see you.

07:31.751 --> 07:33.753
Ooh! Ouch!

07:33.753 --> 07:36.586
One pound heavier, Fras.

07:37.590 --> 07:39.091
Well, that can't be.

07:39.091 --> 07:41.855
I've added a salad
to every meal.

07:44.897 --> 07:46.632
So, at the end
of one week,

07:46.632 --> 07:48.930
it's KPXY down 1 7 pounds,
KACL down nine.

07:49.635 --> 07:50.932
That's all
the time we have.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.639
Join me tomorrow,
when my guests

07:53.639 --> 07:56.642
will be the
Senior Citizen Handbell Chorus.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.945
Have a neat day!

07:58.945 --> 08:01.914
Listen, muscle weighs
more than fat, you know,

08:01.914 --> 08:04.144
and the way I've been
working out lately--

08:04.617 --> 08:06.744
Save it, lard-ass.

08:08.554 --> 08:10.545
Hey, you know, Crane?
When they say,

08:10.923 --> 08:14.126
"Take one for the team, "
they don't mean another cruller.

08:14.126 --> 08:16.094
Oh, shut up, Shafter.
You'rea cruller.

08:16.529 --> 08:18.793
Oh, give it up. I'll drop you
a postcard from Vegas.

08:19.198 --> 08:20.766
We are going to win
this competition, mister.

08:20.766 --> 08:22.631
And when we do, you will
replace that chess set.

08:22.869 --> 08:23.936
Okay, deal.
But if we win,

08:23.936 --> 08:25.631
you're showing up
at our station

08:25.938 --> 08:27.673
in your little
field hockey uniform.

08:27.673 --> 08:29.641
You're on, you fat scoundrel.

08:29.809 --> 08:31.544
All right.
Shake on it.

08:31.544 --> 08:32.738
Psych!

08:33.111 --> 08:34.647
I'm sorry. Sorry.

08:34.647 --> 08:35.515
That wasn't cool. Here we go.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.517
Psych!

08:37.517 --> 08:39.652
Hey, hey, hey. Wait a minute.
It's not a deal

08:39.652 --> 08:41.687
unless we shake on it. Come on.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.655
Come on.

08:43.655 --> 08:46.526
I'm wouldn't do it
for a third time.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.961
All right.

08:48.961 --> 08:50.189
Psych!

08:51.197 --> 08:53.188
God, I missed you.

08:58.571 --> 09:00.072
Hello, Martin.

09:00.072 --> 09:01.061
Hey, Dad.

09:05.912 --> 09:06.946
How's Barney doing?

09:06.946 --> 09:07.947
Oh, he's doing
a lot better today.

09:07.947 --> 09:10.541
Great. I brought
him a treat.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.084
Millet and sunflower kernels,

09:12.084 --> 09:13.847
with added calcium
for beak conditioning.

09:14.086 --> 09:15.144
What happened
to your neck?

09:15.621 --> 09:16.883
Oh, fell out of bed.

09:17.123 --> 09:19.692
He's been so
accident-prone lately.

09:19.692 --> 09:22.662
Every morning,
it's something else.

09:22.662 --> 09:25.256
Shamu jump the tank again?

09:25.731 --> 09:28.734
Fortunately, I moisturized
right before bed,

09:28.734 --> 09:31.965
so I squirted out
like a watermelon seed.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.672
(exhaling deeply)

09:35.007 --> 09:35.803
You all right, son?

09:36.075 --> 09:38.305
Walked upstairs.

09:38.744 --> 09:39.979
Why did you
walk upstairs?

09:39.979 --> 09:42.311
Burning calories.

09:42.682 --> 09:44.083
Oh, yes, I saw you on TV.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.779
You know, that Kelly Kirkland
is quite an actress.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.789
I once saw her in a production
of Love Letters

09:49.789 --> 09:51.090
with Bill Nye the Science Guy.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.081
Tears.

09:55.094 --> 09:57.790
I've decided to rededicate myself to this diet.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.792
The opposing team is captained

10:00.099 --> 10:02.659
by my old high school nemesis,
Wayne Shafter.

10:02.802 --> 10:05.100
(gasps) Which one was he?

10:05.271 --> 10:09.207
Thick neck, dead eyes,
snapped your PBS umbrella.

10:11.711 --> 10:16.015
For the next two weeks,
I shall be a speed-walking,

10:16.015 --> 10:19.610
calorie-burning,
pound-shedding machine.

10:19.685 --> 10:20.674
Daphne,
didn't you purchase

10:21.120 --> 10:23.680
some sort of
stomach-tightening
apparatus for Dad?

10:23.956 --> 10:26.025
The Ab Blaster
or the Flab Buster?

10:26.025 --> 10:28.016
Bring me both of them.
I'll put them together,

10:28.728 --> 10:30.025
see if I can get
a real good workout going.

10:30.396 --> 10:34.696
So... is that
bird nesting

10:34.900 --> 10:37.303
in my cashmere scarf?

10:37.303 --> 10:38.770
Yeah. We tried
a whole bunch of them.

10:39.271 --> 10:40.272
That's the one he likes best.

10:40.272 --> 10:41.102
All right,
that's it.

10:41.407 --> 10:43.242
I want that sky rat
out of here.

10:43.242 --> 10:44.810
Oh, no! Eddie
will be crushed.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.675
The bird
is like his pet.

10:46.879 --> 10:49.439
Eddieisa pet!
He doesn't get to have a pet

10:54.286 --> 10:55.776
I guess Barney
is pretty well recovered.

10:56.255 --> 10:58.257
Yeah, I guess.

10:58.257 --> 11:00.748
Well, time to go, Barney.

11:00.826 --> 11:02.418
Oh, Eddie,
don't worry.

11:02.862 --> 11:04.853
He'll come back and visit you.

11:05.131 --> 11:06.792
It's kind of hard
letting him go.

11:06.932 --> 11:08.668
Now I know how you
must have felt

11:08.668 --> 11:11.660
all those times
when you dropped me off
at musical theater camp.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.972
Sad and frightened...

11:17.677 --> 11:19.872
Lots of emotions, son.

11:22.248 --> 11:24.750
Barney,
remember us fondly

11:24.750 --> 11:27.253
as you spread
your wings

11:27.253 --> 11:29.744
and soar free.

11:31.757 --> 11:33.247
Oh, my God! Barney!

11:33.759 --> 11:34.760
Where did he go?

11:34.760 --> 11:35.988
Is he soaring free?

11:36.295 --> 11:37.830
He bounced off the railing

11:37.830 --> 11:39.331
and landed
on the Cunninghams' balcony.

11:39.331 --> 11:41.333
Dad, look--
his wing just moved.

11:41.333 --> 11:42.334
He's alive!

11:42.334 --> 11:43.335
I'll go get him.

11:43.335 --> 11:44.336
Hurry! Hurry!

11:44.336 --> 11:45.838
Don't you die!

11:45.838 --> 11:48.329
I love you,
you tough old bird.

11:49.842 --> 11:51.833
Not you, Mrs. Cunningham.

11:57.249 --> 11:59.251
Hey, what did I tell you
about smoking in the booth?

11:59.251 --> 12:00.786
Oh, bite me.

12:00.786 --> 12:01.754
I need something
to kill my appetite

12:01.754 --> 12:03.813
besides your stupid ugly face.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.026
Gotcha, Bulldog.

12:07.026 --> 12:08.015
Oww!

12:08.728 --> 12:10.730
What did I tell you
about that?

12:10.730 --> 12:12.998
Thieves! Brigands!

12:12.998 --> 12:15.367
I had three-and-a-half ounces
of sashimi-grade ahi

12:15.367 --> 12:17.336
in the fridge,
and one of you has stolen it.

12:17.336 --> 12:18.337
Not me.

12:18.337 --> 12:19.338
Well, it wasn't me.

12:19.338 --> 12:20.840
And it wasn't Noel.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.842
He thinks I'm going
to do him in Vegas,

12:22.842 --> 12:24.844
so he's barely eaten
in two weeks.

12:24.844 --> 12:26.334
That's why he keeps fainting.

12:28.347 --> 12:30.338
All right, I took it
and I liked it.

12:30.850 --> 12:32.852
What are you going
to do about it? Oww!

12:32.852 --> 12:34.353
fish.
It wasn't even your

12:34.353 --> 12:35.342
Oww!

12:39.358 --> 12:41.360
How long was I out that time?

12:41.360 --> 12:42.349
Ten minutes, big boy.

12:44.296 --> 12:47.333
I've got a bump
the size of an egg.

12:47.333 --> 12:48.334
Don't say "egg"

12:48.334 --> 12:50.336
Don't tell me what to say.

12:50.336 --> 12:52.338
I'm still waiting
for my ahi.

12:52.338 --> 12:54.340
Put a sock in it,
princess.

12:54.340 --> 12:56.342
How dare you!
How dareyou!

12:56.342 --> 12:57.343
(all screaming at once)

12:57.343 --> 12:58.844
People!

12:58.844 --> 13:00.835
People, stop it!

13:02.848 --> 13:05.317
Listen, I understand
that we're all a bit cranky...

13:05.317 --> 13:06.352
Cranky?

13:06.352 --> 13:07.853
We're starving.

13:07.853 --> 13:08.842
I'm not sure I can
hold on much longer.

13:09.355 --> 13:11.357
We've only got
one day more to go.

13:11.357 --> 13:13.859
We can't crack now when
we're this close to victory!

13:13.859 --> 13:16.350
All right, everyone--
take a deep breath.

13:16.862 --> 13:18.853
(all inhale)

13:19.365 --> 13:22.368
(hacking cough)

13:22.368 --> 13:23.369
Yes, Roz.

13:23.369 --> 13:24.870
Cough it all up.

13:24.870 --> 13:27.862
Don't want any
extra phlegm weight.

13:28.374 --> 13:30.876
CROWD (in distance):
"Happy birthday to you..."

13:30.876 --> 13:31.877
Whose birthday is it?

13:31.877 --> 13:33.379
Gina in accounting.

13:33.379 --> 13:34.368
Who's Gina again?

13:34.880 --> 13:35.948
New chick.

13:35.948 --> 13:37.813
So-so face,
little big in the can.

13:37.917 --> 13:38.975
Oh, yeah.

13:39.451 --> 13:41.253
Perhaps I'll go
wish dear Gina well.

13:41.253 --> 13:42.354
Hey, good idea.

13:42.354 --> 13:43.844
FRASIER:
Now that's the team spirit!

13:44.356 --> 13:45.357
We may be dieting

13:45.357 --> 13:46.859
but we can
still nourish ourselves

13:46.859 --> 13:49.361
on some good office fellowship.

13:49.361 --> 13:50.851
Please give Gina
my regards as well.

13:51.363 --> 13:52.364
Okay, Doc, see you.

13:52.364 --> 13:53.866
That's a rog!

13:53.866 --> 13:56.368
Ah, it's a good team.

13:56.368 --> 13:57.870
Good people.

13:57.870 --> 13:59.371
Good God!

13:59.371 --> 14:01.407
Wait!

14:01.407 --> 14:02.908
It's not worth it!

14:02.908 --> 14:04.398
It's sheet cake!

14:06.000 --> 14:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:14.954 --> 14:17.223
Will you stop that
infernal bouncing?

14:17.223 --> 14:18.155
BULLDOG :
No sir, no sir.

14:18.691 --> 14:19.892
Gotta keep moving.

14:19.892 --> 14:22.228
Constant movement
equals constant calorie burn.

14:22.228 --> 14:24.196
You sure you guys don't want
some appetite suppressants?

14:25.998 --> 14:27.898
What the hell
are those things, anyway?

14:28.167 --> 14:30.635
They're fine. They're natura
They have ginseng.

14:31.470 --> 14:32.471
Oh.

14:32.471 --> 14:34.473
Oh, come on in, Dad.

14:34.473 --> 14:35.462
What's going on?

14:35.975 --> 14:36.964
We had a bit of
a discipline breakdown

14:37.376 --> 14:38.377
We've all agreed to spend

14:38.377 --> 14:39.366
the last 1 2 hours
before the final weigh-in

14:40.012 --> 14:40.880
policing each other.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.882
It's a good thing
you had dinner out.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.383
I've purged the apartment of all of foodstuffs.

14:44.383 --> 14:45.941
Who's that gentleman
on the floor?

14:48.254 --> 14:49.955
He passes out
from time to time,

14:49.955 --> 14:51.257
but not to worry.

14:51.257 --> 14:52.958
I'm sure the next searing stomach cramp

14:52.958 --> 14:53.959
will bring him around.

14:53.959 --> 14:55.256
(groaning)

14:56.262 --> 14:57.251
There you are.

14:57.963 --> 14:59.265
You can set your watch
by him.

14:59.265 --> 15:00.163
All right, everybody,

15:00.499 --> 15:02.034
I believe my bathroom
has probably finished

15:02.034 --> 15:03.535
its transformation
into a steam room by now.

15:03.535 --> 15:04.399
If you'll all join me.

15:04.937 --> 15:07.039
We can relax and sweat off

15:07.039 --> 15:09.041
a few extra ounces.

15:09.041 --> 15:10.042
Okay, you
heard the doc.

15:10.042 --> 15:11.031
Let's go, let'
s go, let's go!

15:13.345 --> 15:15.347
Hey, Barney.

15:15.347 --> 15:18.050
How's my favorite patient?

15:18.050 --> 15:19.347
Hey, making progress.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.285
He doesn't even flinch
anymore at the sound
of your voice.

15:23.289 --> 15:24.984
He's letting me
stroke his wing.

15:25.291 --> 15:26.019
You know what?

15:26.292 --> 15:27.691
I'm going to put this birdseed

15:28.127 --> 15:30.129
in a bowl.

15:30.129 --> 15:32.631
Oh... You know,

15:32.631 --> 15:34.133
there's a sad little fellow

15:34.133 --> 15:36.635
who's been dying
to say hello to you all day.

15:36.635 --> 15:38.637
That's better.

15:38.637 --> 15:41.106
Eddie, come on, say hello.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.475
Oh, my God. Eddie!

15:43.475 --> 15:44.476
Eddie!

15:44.476 --> 15:45.477
Hey, Dad.

15:45.477 --> 15:46.466
Oh, no.

15:49.982 --> 15:50.971
I've been thinking.

15:51.483 --> 15:53.474
You know...
Shh.

15:55.988 --> 15:57.455
Keep it quiet.

15:57.957 --> 16:01.222
That wing rub you gave him
put him right to sleep.

16:01.493 --> 16:03.495
Well, that's kinda sweet.

16:03.495 --> 16:05.986
Well, uh, I-I'll just go home.

16:06.498 --> 16:08.500
You know, Dad...

16:08.500 --> 16:12.493
I think he may like me
even more than he likes Eddie.

16:13.105 --> 16:13.969
No contest.

16:18.043 --> 16:20.045
BULLDOG :
How much longer, Doc?

16:20.045 --> 16:22.681
Another half an hov

16:22.681 --> 16:25.517
I can't keep my cigarette lit.

16:25.517 --> 16:27.007
NOEL (weakly):
Roz...

16:27.252 --> 16:29.254
take my hand.

16:29.254 --> 16:30.255
Fine, Noel.

16:30.255 --> 16:32.758
I'll take
your stupid hand.

16:32.758 --> 16:34.760
Where are you?

16:34.760 --> 16:35.761
GIL:
Roz!

16:35.761 --> 16:38.764
Oh, my God!
Put on a towel, you perv!

16:38.764 --> 16:39.765
If I'd known
this sort of thing

16:39.765 --> 16:41.266
went on
in steam rooms,

16:41.266 --> 16:42.255
I would never
have let you lure me in.

16:42.768 --> 16:45.170
All right,
just relax, team.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.172
Feel the steam...

16:47.172 --> 16:50.609
Iiterally melting
the pounds away.

16:50.609 --> 16:52.311
KENNY:
Oh, I'm about to faint.

16:52.311 --> 16:54.613
I'm going
to grab some water.

16:54.613 --> 16:56.315
(door opens and closes)

16:56.315 --> 16:58.617
You sure you want
to leave him alone out there?

16:58.617 --> 17:00.119
He could be on his way
to Pizza Hut.

17:00.119 --> 17:01.553
Good point.

17:01.553 --> 17:03.384
I'll just go
check on him.

17:08.394 --> 17:10.029
ROZ: It's weird.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.031
My skin
tastes kinda salty.

17:12.031 --> 17:16.335
BULLDOG : Oh, I'd say mostly sweet,
but a little salty.

17:16.335 --> 17:17.324
That wasn't me, Bulldog.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.339
GIL: That was me
you licked,

17:21.339 --> 17:22.340
and if it
happens again,

17:22.340 --> 17:24.036
I shall consider
it strike one.

17:33.152 --> 17:34.141
Mmm.

18:01.180 --> 18:05.241
Kenny, what did you just eat?

18:06.452 --> 18:08.215
(sucks teeth) Nothing.

18:09.855 --> 18:10.844
You have a toothpick.

18:11.290 --> 18:13.292
Oh, all right.
I couldn't take it anymore.

18:13.292 --> 18:14.293
I only had a mouthful.

18:14.293 --> 18:16.161
Dear God!

18:16.161 --> 18:17.629
What happened?

18:17.629 --> 18:21.266
This ravenous madman's
just eaten a live pigeon.

18:21.266 --> 18:22.858
No, I didn't!
I only had some seeds.

18:23.235 --> 18:26.138
If Kenny gets seeds,
we all get seeds.

18:26.138 --> 18:27.127
Where are they?

18:27.639 --> 18:29.141
No, get away!
I saw them first!

18:29.141 --> 18:30.642
Give me those!

18:30.642 --> 18:32.132
Stop it.

18:32.644 --> 18:34.146
Stop it!

18:34.146 --> 18:36.637
Stop this madness!

18:37.149 --> 18:39.879
Look at yourselves!

18:40.219 --> 18:42.779
Dear God.

18:43.255 --> 18:46.156
We are hours away from victory,
and look at you.

18:46.658 --> 18:50.526
Pecking around the floor
like a clutch of crazed capons!

18:50.796 --> 18:53.732
Try to conjure up
some image

18:53.732 --> 18:56.335
to give us strength.

18:56.335 --> 18:58.337
Imagine yourselves winning.

18:58.337 --> 19:00.703
Imagine yourselves in Vegas.

19:01.006 --> 19:04.209
I'm still hungry.

19:04.209 --> 19:06.211
Stay out of the hallway.

19:06.211 --> 19:08.213
Eddie just threw up
a dead pigeon

19:08.213 --> 19:10.204
and now he's eating it again.

19:11.550 --> 19:12.312
Okay, that's it.

19:12.551 --> 19:13.540
That'll do for me.

19:16.722 --> 19:18.690
Next up, the final weigh-in

19:18.690 --> 19:21.426

Anything that will add
just an ounce of weight.

19:30.569 --> 19:33.272
Hey, Crane... Iookingforward to seeing you

19:33.272 --> 19:34.573

19:34.573 --> 19:35.437
Oh, yeah?

19:35.774 --> 19:36.832
I'm going be so busy

19:37.276 --> 19:38.277
playing with that new chess set
you're gonna buy me

19:38.277 --> 19:42.281
that I won't even have time
to put on my skirt.

19:42.281 --> 19:44.272
Not that I still have it!

19:44.716 --> 19:46.218

Huddle up.
Here's the plan.

19:53.225 --> 19:54.715
I'll stand in the middle.

19:55.227 --> 19:57.229
You surround me
and lift me up

19:57.229 --> 19:58.719
so I'm not even
touching the scale.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.228
What?

20:03.435 --> 20:06.471
Wow. You have lost
an impressive

20:06.471 --> 20:09.463
44 pounds,
two ounces.

20:09.975 --> 20:12.077
Great job, guys!

20:12.077 --> 20:15.280
I see giant steaks
with legs.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.583
You're hallucinating.

20:17.583 --> 20:18.584
Just pull it together.

20:18.584 --> 20:19.585
No, he's right.

20:19.585 --> 20:21.286
It's the Beef

Oh, my goodness.

20:31.597 --> 20:33.599
44 pounds even.

20:33.599 --> 20:36.466
You lose by two ounces.

20:36.735 --> 20:40.439
No! I'm not getting emphysema for this.

20:40.439 --> 20:41.440
Cut me.

20:41.440 --> 20:42.441
I can't.

20:42.441 --> 20:43.430
Cut me, damn it!

Wow!

21:01.793 --> 21:03.295
Don't go away.

21:03.295 --> 21:06.298
When we come back, we have
a little dance number

21:06.298 --> 21:08.789
that's both "rare"
and "well done. "

21:13.338 --> 21:16.330
Okay, Crane, you won.

21:16.608 --> 21:19.311
