00:01.085 --> 00:02.541
AUDREY 1: Previously on Haven...

00:02.753 --> 00:05.165
-/ need to know more about her.
-GARLAND: Lucy Ripley.

00:05.256 --> 00:06.291
What do you think? Is she your mother?

00:06.382 --> 00:07.417
-NATHAN: You like it.
-Like what?

00:07.550 --> 00:08.585
The weirdness.

00:08.676 --> 00:09.711
That's why you're still here.

00:09.802 --> 00:11.918
No, I'm still here
because a woman who was here

00:12.013 --> 00:14.220
could have been my mom,
and I'd like to find out.

00:14.432 --> 00:16.673
-You seriously can't feel pain?
-No.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.678
AUDREY 1: What’s wrong?
NATHAN: / can feel you.

00:18.769 --> 00:21.055
-How long have you known?
-A while.

00:21.189 --> 00:23.100
Somebody out there with a tattoo
wants to kill me.

00:23.191 --> 00:24.681
I’m hoping that whatever/ ﬁnd buried here

00:24.775 --> 00:26.936
will give me the answers
about how / stay alive.

00:27.737 --> 00:30.604
Doesn’t exact/y look like something
that’s gonna save my life.

00:30.823 --> 00:33.360
DUKE: Is there anything
that you can tell me about this box?

00:33.451 --> 00:35.567
Stories? Legends? Powers?

00:35.661 --> 00:37.197
Why are you working with the Rev?

00:37.288 --> 00:39.279
They said that you were important.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.955
-Who's they? The Rev?
-He's one of them.

00:42.043 --> 00:44.955
You're gonna tell him what he wants to know,
or I will!

00:45.046 --> 00:46.661
-(GUNSHOT)
-Evil

00:46.756 --> 00:47.791
AUDREY 1: The Rev?

00:47.882 --> 00:49.247
He's in the middle of all this.

00:49.342 --> 00:50.627
We're chasing down the troubled.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.458
Your way is gonna get people killed.

00:52.553 --> 00:53.963
It'll be the right people.

00:54.180 --> 00:55.545
The Rev's been talking a long time.

00:55.806 --> 00:57.091
I think he's finally making his move.

00:57.183 --> 00:58.218
(GUNSHOT)

01:11.530 --> 01:13.111
(PANTING)

01:13.199 --> 01:14.405
WOMAN: Hi, Reggie.

01:14.492 --> 01:16.608
Yeah, I know. It's hot, right? (LAUGHS)

01:17.203 --> 01:19.694
Doing great, though.
It's all about hydration.

01:21.082 --> 01:24.165
But you gotta slow down, right,
because you'll cramp up.

01:26.629 --> 01:27.914
(GRUNTS)

01:30.174 --> 01:31.710
Is this your first race, sir?

01:35.596 --> 01:37.632
Can I get a race medic, please?

01:38.140 --> 01:39.175
(GROANS)

01:45.231 --> 01:46.437
(GASPING)

01:53.614 --> 01:54.945
Oh, my...

01:55.199 --> 01:56.234
Oh!

01:58.286 --> 01:59.321
(EXCLAIMS SOFTLY)

02:00.246 --> 02:01.281
Oh.

02:02.498 --> 02:03.658
Help!

02:07.420 --> 02:09.786
-Hot enough for you?
-I wouldn't know.

02:11.048 --> 02:12.083
Your shirt does.

02:12.174 --> 02:13.505
(CHUCKLES) You're hot.

02:14.176 --> 02:16.383
Not as hot as this poor guy, though.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.176
Looks like every drop of water

02:18.264 --> 02:20.596
was just sucked right on out of him.

02:20.683 --> 02:22.890
As for an ID, prints,

02:22.977 --> 02:24.717
they're going to be tough.

02:24.895 --> 02:29.764
But fortunately, we've got, yep, number 15.

02:29.859 --> 02:31.395
"Reggie Buswell."

02:31.694 --> 02:33.855
You ever run a 10k?

02:34.071 --> 02:36.187
-No.
-Wonder if I ever have.

02:36.282 --> 02:39.490
I know Audrey Parker didn't,
but maybe Lucy Ripley did.

02:41.078 --> 02:44.491
You can't keep pretending
what happened didn't happen.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.246
You killed the Rev.

02:47.001 --> 02:50.414
Nathan, there was a full investigation
into my shooting of the Rev, okay?

02:50.504 --> 02:51.914
It cleared.

02:52.173 --> 02:54.209
It's gonna... It's gonna fade away.

02:54.300 --> 02:57.292
Well, right now,
it's all anyone's talking about.

02:59.180 --> 03:00.295
Hey, Dwight.

03:02.183 --> 03:03.923
Oh, man. Reggie?

03:04.060 --> 03:06.642
-We used to go fishing together.
-l'm sorry.

03:06.729 --> 03:07.844
He was troubled?

03:08.230 --> 03:09.606
-Yeah.
-DUKE: You know how?

03:11.067 --> 03:12.523
DWIGHT: Maybe it was this?

03:13.903 --> 03:15.564
Hey. He never said, I never asked.

03:15.654 --> 03:17.235
A lot of people don't like to talk about it.

03:17.323 --> 03:19.655
We were both going to Finnegan's
tomorrow night for the meeting.

03:21.160 --> 03:22.275
What meeting?

03:22.370 --> 03:25.828
Some troubled people
were a little worried about the repercussions

03:25.915 --> 03:29.954
after what happened to the Rev,
so we're getting together.

03:30.252 --> 03:32.117
-lt's people winding each other up.
-Listen.

03:32.213 --> 03:34.875
We're just talking about
how we can start to look out for each other.

03:35.758 --> 03:37.339
Yeah. Maybe you should go.

03:37.426 --> 03:39.212
Maybe I should shut it down.

03:40.429 --> 03:42.260
PATRICK: Hey, come here!

03:42.390 --> 03:43.470
You're not running off! I wanna talk to you.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.343
Get Reggie packed up for the coroner.

03:45.434 --> 03:46.890
PATRICK: Hey! Come here.

03:47.186 --> 03:49.017
I saw you and Reggie
going at it on the course.

03:49.105 --> 03:50.891
Now that volunteer says he's all dried out?

03:50.981 --> 03:52.061
What'd you do to him, huh?

03:52.149 --> 03:53.855
I don't know what you're talking about.

03:54.318 --> 03:55.774
Are you one of those freaks?

03:55.903 --> 03:57.143
Your name is Stu, right?

03:57.238 --> 03:58.398
What's your name?

03:58.572 --> 04:00.858
Patrick Grolsch. Taxpayer, okay? This guy...

04:00.950 --> 04:02.190
Calm down, Mr. Grolsch.

04:02.284 --> 04:04.570
Why? So Haven PD
can cover it up like nothing happened?

04:04.662 --> 04:06.527
You expect us to just roll over

04:06.622 --> 04:08.453
and let these people do whatever they want.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.955
And yet, another freak walks free.

04:14.213 --> 04:16.499
You know, everyone in this town
is tired of what's going on.

04:16.715 --> 04:19.843
And when you screw up again,
you're going down.

04:21.846 --> 04:23.302
Both of you.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.041
NATHAN: It's gotta be
more than a name match.

05:02.386 --> 05:06.595
This is really important to me.
How sure are you?

05:10.227 --> 05:12.218
Gotta go. Call me when you got something.

05:13.564 --> 05:14.599
Coroner report.

05:18.152 --> 05:21.064
"Dehydration inconsistent with exercise."

05:21.614 --> 05:23.024
You don't think that
the trouble was triggered

05:23.115 --> 05:24.651
by the stress of the race, do you?

05:24.742 --> 05:27.825
I don't think so. I've never seen a trouble
triggered byjust physical stress.

05:27.912 --> 05:29.277
Wait a second. There's a new coroner?

05:29.413 --> 05:31.244
What happened to Horace?

05:31.332 --> 05:32.572
Nothing.

05:33.167 --> 05:35.203
I asked Dwight to use a guy in Cleaves Mills.

05:35.294 --> 05:38.502
Might be best to keep this case quiet.

05:38.589 --> 05:41.046
Yeah, 'cause normally we shout
The Troubles from the rooftops.

05:41.133 --> 05:42.919
Even quieter than usual?

05:43.260 --> 05:45.342
NATHAN: We need to let things die down
a little.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.837
Nathan, I did what I had to do.

05:47.932 --> 05:49.297
I'm not questioning that.

05:49.433 --> 05:51.674
But you saw those people this morning.
They're not happy.

05:51.769 --> 05:53.259
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

05:53.938 --> 05:55.269
Wuornos.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.104
On our way.

05:58.484 --> 06:00.190
We've got another dried-out body.

06:06.784 --> 06:08.320
ANNIE: Barry warned me
before we got married

06:08.452 --> 06:11.114
that someday something could happen.

06:11.372 --> 06:12.953
I didn't think it'd be like this.

06:13.666 --> 06:17.124
I'm sorry, Annie.
What... What do you mean by "like this"?

06:17.461 --> 06:19.952
Barry was, you know...

06:21.465 --> 06:22.625
Troubled.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.001
Yeah.

06:24.677 --> 06:26.668
He was trying to protect me, he said.

06:26.804 --> 06:28.340
But he was ashamed.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.718
Anyone else know about his affliction?
How it worked?

06:31.976 --> 06:35.468
Just family. And his friend Stu.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.310
-Stu?
-Stu Pierce.

06:38.023 --> 06:40.810
He was always talking to Barry
about their problems.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.984
He even convinced him to go to that
stupid meeting he was organizing.

06:44.154 --> 06:47.317
Stu was organizing that meeting
for troubled people tomorrow night.

06:48.158 --> 06:49.739
He ran away before I could talk to him.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.238
And both of our victims were attending.

06:58.168 --> 07:01.205
Annie said Stu was compiling
a list of troubled people.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.875
What, so Stu's
some kind of troubled sociopath

07:04.008 --> 07:05.544
that collects the names of troubled people,

07:05.676 --> 07:07.257
and then picks them off one by one?

07:07.344 --> 07:09.721
Barry was ashamed of who he was.

07:09.847 --> 07:13.055
Maybe Stu hates himself so much
he wants to kill people like him.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.845
Okay, the fact that you
came up with that profile so quickly,

07:15.936 --> 07:17.597
that worries me.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.567
Maybe someone figured out
Stu was killing his own.

07:22.693 --> 07:24.900
Maybe they came for revenge.

07:28.699 --> 07:30.064
(GROANING)

07:31.952 --> 07:33.283
Ma'am, are you okay?

07:33.370 --> 07:34.951
Please, my husband!

07:35.039 --> 07:36.620
Your husband? Your husband did this?

07:36.707 --> 07:38.447
No, my husband, Stu.

07:38.542 --> 07:40.874
They attacked us and they took him away.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.373
House is clear. They're gone.

07:43.547 --> 07:45.048
I don't think Stu's the killer.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.714
They've got him.
And they've probably got his list, too.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.463
Then whoever took him
knows the name of every person

07:50.554 --> 07:52.135
going to that meeting.

07:52.222 --> 07:54.554
Our kidnapper has a hit list.

07:56.727 --> 07:58.058
DUKE: No, Mrs. Ryan.

07:58.145 --> 08:02.605
I... I get it. Your daughter liked her secrets.

08:03.317 --> 08:05.399
That's part of her charm.

08:06.278 --> 08:07.563
Uh-huh.

08:11.575 --> 08:12.735
Sure.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.404
I'll inventory her stuff before I send it.

08:17.915 --> 08:18.904
(PHONE BEEPS)

08:20.417 --> 08:22.282
Your grief is touching.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.836
What? She bought it back?

08:32.096 --> 08:33.256
Evi.

08:42.314 --> 08:45.806
"Duke, In case things go bad,
you should have this. I'm sorry."

09:11.051 --> 09:12.882
You've gotta be kidding me.

09:15.472 --> 09:18.134
Colleen, um, I need you to tell me anything

09:18.225 --> 09:21.308
that you can remember
about those men that took Stu.

09:23.021 --> 09:27.355
Well, they were all wearing masks
with gloves and hoods, but, um...

09:28.235 --> 09:29.816
When they were tying me up on the ground,

09:29.903 --> 09:33.487
I remember there was something
on their leg like a tattoo?

09:33.991 --> 09:35.322
In the shape of a circle?

09:35.534 --> 09:41.245
No, it was more like a big number, like a...
Maybe a three and a... And an eight?

09:41.665 --> 09:45.123
It's not a tattoo, but permanent marker's
pretty hard to wash off.

09:45.210 --> 09:47.417
Stu's kidnapper was running in that 10k.

09:47.504 --> 09:50.041
I bet if we checked those race numbers
for a three and an eight,

09:50.174 --> 09:52.756
we're gonna find out he's Patrick Grolsch.

09:53.510 --> 09:54.625
We have your race number,

09:54.720 --> 09:56.836
and we saw you arguing with Stu, all right?

09:56.930 --> 09:58.340
Why did you kidnap him?

09:58.515 --> 10:00.426
Did you decide killing Reggie
and Barry wasn't enough?

10:00.684 --> 10:01.924
You're nuts.

10:02.019 --> 10:04.351
I heard what happened to those two.
How could I have done that?

10:04.730 --> 10:06.516
Maybe you used your affliction.

10:06.690 --> 10:07.930
You're suggesting I'm troubled?

10:08.025 --> 10:09.856
Or you're working with someone that is.

10:10.027 --> 10:12.609
Look. All you have is half a number on a leg.

10:12.696 --> 10:15.187
Okay, listen.
I don't know what your lawyer told you...

10:15.365 --> 10:16.741
Lady, I am a lawyer.

10:16.867 --> 10:19.574
And I have witnesses
that saw you harassing me at the race.

10:19.703 --> 10:22.866
And now you drag me in here
with no probable cause?

10:23.207 --> 10:27.041
I'm filing a suit, a very public suit.

10:34.718 --> 10:35.833
No.

10:35.928 --> 10:38.260
Good luck finding your friend.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.720
I can't believe you just did that.

10:40.808 --> 10:42.469
(SHUSHING) I am trying to protect you.

10:42.893 --> 10:45.475
Because suddenly, I need protecting now?

10:45.604 --> 10:47.845
Why, because I was the only one
that had the nerve

10:47.940 --> 10:50.056
to shoot a guy
that was gonna kill a little girl?

10:50.150 --> 10:52.232
A troubled little girl
who happened to be a cannibal,

10:52.319 --> 10:53.980
and the man you shot was the Rev,

10:54.071 --> 10:55.481
one of this town's leaders.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.028
Is that what you're worried about?

10:57.115 --> 10:58.855
What the town thinks?

10:58.951 --> 11:00.691
What about what you think, Nathan?

11:00.786 --> 11:03.072
You know what?
Actually, since this whole thing started,

11:03.163 --> 11:05.404
you haven't said what you think.

11:05.749 --> 11:07.114
So tell me.

11:09.086 --> 11:10.576
Do you think I did the right thing?

11:12.589 --> 11:13.669
Yes.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.752
I know you did what you had to do

11:16.844 --> 11:18.425
to save that girl's life.

11:19.263 --> 11:21.925
But right now, my opinion doesn't matter,

11:22.015 --> 11:24.677
and I can't do myjob if I'm under indictment.

11:24.768 --> 11:27.259
People are just looking for an excuse,

11:27.354 --> 11:29.936
so at least one of us
has to follow procedure.

11:31.275 --> 11:32.435
Okay.

11:40.617 --> 11:41.823
(THUD)

11:59.469 --> 12:01.005
Teague and Teague Incorporated.

12:01.096 --> 12:03.178
-Yeah.
-I've been looking for you boys.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.138
Had to help with the deliveries.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.181
The paper's already on its third edition.

12:07.269 --> 12:09.385
Everybody wants to read about the Rev.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.477
Yeah, I think I'll wait for the movie.

12:11.815 --> 12:12.850
(CHUCKLES)

12:13.650 --> 12:16.687
I was hoping
I could show you boys something.

12:27.122 --> 12:28.828
What do you think it is?

12:30.417 --> 12:31.623
A silver box.

12:32.753 --> 12:33.868
Yes.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.299
Well, look at that.

12:46.600 --> 12:47.760
Very interesting.

12:47.851 --> 12:50.513
Well, still looks like a silver box to me.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.019
Can I see that?

12:56.026 --> 12:59.314
Well. I've seen this design before.

12:59.404 --> 13:02.271
It's one of our early silversmiths.

13:02.658 --> 13:05.274
You think you could find out
anything more about this box?

13:05.369 --> 13:07.576
What the hell it has to do with the Crockers?

13:07.663 --> 13:09.199
If my father ever owned it?

13:09.289 --> 13:10.404
Well, I'm sorry, Duke.

13:10.499 --> 13:13.491
We're just too busy right now
to take on another project.

13:13.835 --> 13:17.419
I'd be happy to do a little research.
Shouldn't take long at all.

13:17.839 --> 13:18.999
Okay.

13:21.093 --> 13:24.335
Oh, Vince didn't get
a lot of sleep last night, uh...

13:24.930 --> 13:26.295
Shellfish before bed.

13:26.390 --> 13:30.224
Yeah, I'm sorry for my irritability.

13:30.811 --> 13:32.802
Yeah, well,
why don't you just leave the box with...

13:32.896 --> 13:36.138
You know, I...
I think the box should stay with me.

13:39.361 --> 13:40.726
-Dave?
-Mmm?

13:40.862 --> 13:42.398
Let me know if you find anything?

13:43.115 --> 13:44.525
I'd be happy to.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.198
You have a nice day, gentlemen.

13:50.205 --> 13:51.786
I will stop you.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.536
It's time this town faces realities.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.454
All of them.

13:57.045 --> 13:58.876
(CAR ENGINE STARTING)

14:13.478 --> 14:15.139
Come and see me.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.137
I've got a job for you.

14:19.568 --> 14:21.308
(CAR ENGINE STOPS)

15:22.798 --> 15:23.958
Sasquatch?

15:30.639 --> 15:31.879
(GROANS)

15:57.582 --> 16:00.619
You know, we don't talk enough, me and you.

16:01.002 --> 16:02.742
(PANTING)
This doesn't have to get ugly.

16:02.963 --> 16:05.170
I'll walk out of here. It's over.

16:05.715 --> 16:06.921
Great.

16:07.259 --> 16:10.922
If you don't mind, you can just leave the box
in the umbrella stand on your way out.

16:11.888 --> 16:13.264
Give me the key.

16:13.348 --> 16:14.554
Do I actually have to say no to that,

16:14.641 --> 16:16.472
or can Ijust assume
it was a rhetorical statement?

16:19.521 --> 16:21.182
Vince sent you, didn't he?

16:21.439 --> 16:22.975
If you say so.

16:23.567 --> 16:24.727
Dave is helping me.

16:25.694 --> 16:26.900
So it begs the question,

16:27.779 --> 16:28.859
what's so important about that thing

16:28.947 --> 16:31.233
that it's got the two of them
turning on each other?

16:31.408 --> 16:32.523
I didn't ask.

16:32.701 --> 16:34.362
I think you did.

16:34.911 --> 16:37.948
And I think that Vince clammed up on you.

16:39.624 --> 16:40.909
Come on.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.037
Aren't you even a little bit curious?

16:43.253 --> 16:44.618
All right, so why don't you tell me?

16:45.922 --> 16:47.423
I'd love to.

16:48.842 --> 16:51.834
But, uh, I don't have a freaking clue.

16:56.558 --> 16:59.971
Vince and Dave know what it is.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.686
But they don't want us to know.

17:06.943 --> 17:08.683
They're playing us against each other.

17:11.865 --> 17:16.985
So, do we go back to
kicking each other's asses,

17:18.496 --> 17:19.997
or do we find out the truth?

17:42.145 --> 17:43.351
How'd you find Patrick?

17:48.318 --> 17:51.151
He's a lawyer, Parker.
You're just making his case stronger.

17:53.365 --> 17:56.528
Why am I the bad guy
for trying to help you keep yourjob?

17:56.660 --> 17:58.196
You're not a bad guy.

17:58.995 --> 18:01.862
It's just my ability to help troubled people,

18:01.998 --> 18:05.115
I don't... I don't think that comes
from Audrey Parker or Lucy Ripley.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.620
I think that that's just me.

18:09.172 --> 18:13.006
Think it may be the only thing that is,
so I need to keep on doing that,

18:14.302 --> 18:16.384
even it means bending the law.

18:16.513 --> 18:18.378
Well, there's bending and there's breaking.

18:19.391 --> 18:21.302
And the way you're going,
it's just a matter of time

18:21.393 --> 18:23.429
before you're suspended, fired...

18:23.520 --> 18:25.385
-I don't care.
-How about arrested?

18:27.190 --> 18:29.181
You're going to help people from a jail cell?

18:37.409 --> 18:38.774
That's Patrick.

18:38.868 --> 18:40.404
Wait, what...

18:40.870 --> 18:42.076
What are you going to do?

18:42.205 --> 18:44.366
Nathan, that man is jaywalking.

18:46.376 --> 18:48.207
Oh, damn it!

18:49.921 --> 18:53.709
Hey, it was commissioned
by a Fitzwilliam Crocker in 1786.

18:54.342 --> 18:56.833
He’s, uh, one of your distant ancestors.

18:56.928 --> 18:59.214
Any idea of what it
was supposed to be used for?

18:59.556 --> 19:03.219
Snuff? Cuff links? Colonial condoms?

19:03.560 --> 19:07.599
No record of that.
But, uh, it was originally designed as a set.

19:08.064 --> 19:11.397
The silver box you have is actually
the smaller of the two.

19:11.526 --> 19:13.107
I'm going to have to look into that.

19:13.236 --> 19:15.067
Uh...great work, Dave.

19:19.075 --> 19:20.110
Smooth.

19:20.243 --> 19:22.234
Yeah, it's kinda what I do.

19:22.704 --> 19:26.413
Yeah, which makes me wonder
if I'm making a mistake working with you.

19:26.541 --> 19:27.621
You're not.

19:28.043 --> 19:30.204
Besides, if I am,
I can always change my mind.

19:31.629 --> 19:33.369
Glad to see we're on the same page.

19:35.884 --> 19:38.250
I betcha this key

19:39.262 --> 19:41.548
opens this other box
that Dave is talking about.

19:41.639 --> 19:43.220
Your dad never told you about it?

19:43.600 --> 19:44.635
No.

19:45.435 --> 19:47.767
But our conversations
usually were limited to,

19:47.896 --> 19:51.263
"Run down to the liquor store and get me
some Camel nons and a six-pack."

19:52.567 --> 19:54.273
Sounds a lot like my old man.

19:55.278 --> 19:57.769
Did you two get along?

19:58.615 --> 19:59.650
No.

20:00.075 --> 20:02.487
So if your dad had the box,
where'd he put it?

20:02.786 --> 20:05.778
If Simon Crocker was anything,
he was careful.

20:06.247 --> 20:08.784
If it was valuable, he hid it.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.078
Any ideas where?

20:13.338 --> 20:15.454
We need to find his old boat.

20:19.177 --> 20:20.587
Come on.

20:21.846 --> 20:23.427
PATRICK: Get these handcuffs off me.

20:23.515 --> 20:25.301
You have no cause to keep me here!

20:26.643 --> 20:29.430
This... This is textbook harassment.

20:29.521 --> 20:31.682
State law. You need to cross at the corners.

20:31.815 --> 20:32.975
You know what? I was wrong.

20:33.108 --> 20:35.815
It's not that you don't care about
getting fired, you wanna get fired.

20:35.944 --> 20:37.809
-l'll be fine.
-I won't!

20:40.615 --> 20:43.402
Nathan, you're a good cop, okay?
You're gonna be okay.

20:43.493 --> 20:44.983
I won't be fine.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.610
This isn'tjust about work, Parker.

20:46.830 --> 20:48.821
You're notjust my partner.

20:49.666 --> 20:51.122
Not anymore.

And you're trying to kill him?

21:07.016 --> 21:10.008
Where is Stu Pierce? Is he upstairs?

21:10.145 --> 21:11.305
PATRICK: Why don't you check?

21:11.396 --> 21:13.682
If he is, he's probably gonna need a hand.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.560
Wait.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.100
We don't even know what his trouble is.

21:19.195 --> 21:20.696
There is a reason that he wants you

21:20.822 --> 21:22.904
-to go up there.
-Nathan, listen.

21:23.074 --> 21:26.032
You take care of him.
I'm going to go find Stu.

21:26.202 --> 21:28.033
I'm going to be okay, all right?

21:36.087 --> 21:37.998
Stu, where are you?

You can't touch me.
My sweat, it kills people.

Don't worry, you're not going to hurt me.

Lay it on me.
We're gonna get you out of here.

22:36.564 --> 22:39.021
I can see why your dad
thought this was a good hiding place.

22:39.108 --> 22:41.440
Who the hell fishes around down here
unless they have to?

22:41.569 --> 22:43.946
Yeah, Pops was a real genius.

22:46.241 --> 22:48.357
(GROANS)
So why the hell isn't it here?

22:48.451 --> 22:50.442
-Sure this was his boat?
-Yeah.

22:50.537 --> 22:53.529
Last of the floating trash heaps
he collected over the years.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.281
He sold it to Sal before he died.

22:56.918 --> 22:59.455
If the box was so important,
how come he never mentioned it to you?

22:59.796 --> 23:01.286
You know, I don't think he liked me much.

23:01.381 --> 23:03.121
And I'm damn sure he didn't trust me.

23:03.216 --> 23:06.458
(SIGHS) Or maybe he was just
bad at telling you things, like,

23:06.636 --> 23:08.046
"Son, you're troubled."

23:08.388 --> 23:13.052
If you don't mind me asking,
what exactly is your trouble?

23:17.313 --> 23:18.644
I'm a bullet magnet.

23:19.482 --> 23:24.317
If a gun goes off within 100 yards,
the bullet veers off towards me.

23:25.613 --> 23:28.446

23:39.335 --> 23:40.745
Yeah, screwy thing.

23:41.838 --> 23:45.251
My dad knew I was gonna enlist,
yet he never said a word.

23:45.466 --> 23:47.752
He was willing to let me
walk into a battle zone

23:47.844 --> 23:50.506
rather than admit what he was.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.599
What we were.

23:54.267 --> 23:55.347
You know, I, uh...

23:57.103 --> 23:59.435
I think your dad and my dad would
have been bosom buddies.

23:59.522 --> 24:02.104
What? You two lose a bar bet?

24:02.275 --> 24:04.436
Okay, slow down, Sal. I'm sorry.

24:04.527 --> 24:05.858
I was gonna let you know we were here,

24:05.987 --> 24:07.943
but we were just down here
looking for something

24:08.031 --> 24:09.942
that I thought my dad
might have left behind.

24:10.033 --> 24:11.443
On my boat?

24:11.534 --> 24:13.650
Relax. You're gonna blow a gasket.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.363
Before it was your boat,

24:15.663 --> 24:17.870
this was the last boat that
my father owned before he died...

24:17.957 --> 24:20.448
The second-last boat that Simon owned.

24:20.543 --> 24:22.454
Not according to his papers.

24:22.545 --> 24:23.876
I don't know about papers.

24:24.005 --> 24:26.621
That's the reason Simon gave me
such a sweet deal on the lady here.

24:27.717 --> 24:30.709
He was buying a 120
and the owner wanted cash.

24:30.845 --> 24:33.882
A 120? But you... Are you sure?

24:34.140 --> 24:35.220
Yeah.

24:35.308 --> 24:38.345
Okay, Sal. Do you remember the name?

24:38.686 --> 24:39.801
Cape something.

24:40.313 --> 24:43.146
Cape Rouge?

24:43.316 --> 24:44.305
Yeah, that's it.

24:44.400 --> 24:45.901
No, no, no, no. That's impossible.

24:46.027 --> 24:47.813
I won the Cape Rouge in a poker game

24:47.904 --> 24:49.815
on my 21st birthday, okay?

24:50.573 --> 24:51.653
From who?

24:51.741 --> 24:54.483
-Ray Fiegler, up in Castle Rock.
-Fiegler, yup.

24:54.702 --> 24:56.408
He's the guy Simon gave her to.

24:59.916 --> 25:01.406
That means

25:02.543 --> 25:06.331
my father gave me my boat.

25:08.841 --> 25:10.422
STU: Reggie and lwere running.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.420
He wanted to back out of the meeting.

25:13.721 --> 25:15.177
I grabbed his arm around mile two,

25:15.264 --> 25:17.596
and then... And then he started getting sick.

25:18.267 --> 25:20.098
And that's what triggered your affliction.

25:20.395 --> 25:22.681
lwas scared. I ran home.

25:24.607 --> 25:27.019
Found Barry borrowing my mower.

25:28.277 --> 25:30.359
And he put his arm around me
before I could warn him.

25:30.738 --> 25:32.774
We need to take you
somewhere you'll be safe.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.780
I understand.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.570
No, you can't take him away.

25:36.786 --> 25:38.276
It's this town.

25:38.413 --> 25:40.369
It's the stress of the meeting that did this.

25:40.581 --> 25:42.037
I have to go.

25:45.253 --> 25:47.619
Patrick wasn'tjust planning on killing me.

25:47.964 --> 25:49.374
If they hadn't spooked him,

25:49.465 --> 25:50.545
he was going to parade my affliction

25:50.633 --> 25:52.043
around for the whole world to see.

25:52.218 --> 25:54.630
We have Patrick's prints
all over that building.

25:54.721 --> 25:55.801
He's going to prison.

25:55.930 --> 25:57.466
But what if you hadn't stopped him?

25:57.890 --> 26:00.142
This town isn't safe
for people like me anymore.

26:00.476 --> 26:03.092
Fine. I'm going with you.

26:05.481 --> 26:06.732
For what?

26:06.816 --> 26:08.272
Till The Troubles are over,

26:09.152 --> 26:10.642
I won't even be able to touch you.

26:12.947 --> 26:14.448
I don't care.

26:18.953 --> 26:21.114
For better or for worse, right?

26:37.638 --> 26:40.471
Thank God you found that invite list
Patrick stole from me.

26:40.850 --> 26:43.512
Can you imagine what people like him
would do with something like that?

26:44.937 --> 26:46.188
I suppose you should have it.

26:46.355 --> 26:47.811
Why don't you keep it?

26:48.024 --> 26:49.764
Can't help those people where I'm going.

26:50.276 --> 26:51.436
Maybe you can.

26:53.112 --> 26:56.024
Crazy thing is, I still feel bad
I'm gonna miss that meeting.

26:56.657 --> 26:58.113
It's just gonna divide people.

26:58.868 --> 27:01.860
People are already divided.
There's no going back.

27:02.705 --> 27:04.787
All that's left now is for you
to choose a side.

27:15.009 --> 27:16.840
(MOBILE PHONE CHIMES)

27:45.164 --> 27:47.246
It's going to be tough for them.

27:47.750 --> 27:49.411
Touching isn't everything.

27:50.670 --> 27:52.080
Trust me.

27:53.172 --> 27:54.833
Oh, I hope they make it.

27:55.258 --> 27:56.668
They will.

27:59.220 --> 28:00.756
Still thinking about what he said?

28:01.764 --> 28:05.757
About Haven
not being safe for the troubled anymore?

28:06.978 --> 28:08.434
Maybe you're right.

28:09.772 --> 28:12.263
Maybe by shooting the Rev,
I just made things worse.

28:12.775 --> 28:14.640
You did what you thought was right.

28:14.777 --> 28:16.608
I don't know what I think anymore.

28:17.989 --> 28:19.775
-Audrey.
-I'm serious.

28:21.158 --> 28:22.694
How am I supposed to know
right from wrong

28:22.785 --> 28:24.070
if I don't even know
who the hell I am anymore?

28:24.161 --> 28:25.617
I know who you are.

28:27.456 --> 28:28.616
I do.

28:30.793 --> 28:34.251
Because ofyou, I... Ican...

28:37.174 --> 28:38.584
Never mind.

28:47.643 --> 28:48.849
Whose address is this?

28:50.479 --> 28:52.185
If I'm right, it's Lucy Ripley's.

28:56.110 --> 28:57.975
How did you get this?

28:58.946 --> 29:01.403
I've been putting together everything
we've learned about her.

29:01.490 --> 29:03.151
This past year, I...

29:05.119 --> 29:08.407
From photos and the Glendowers,
people who remembered her.

29:08.497 --> 29:10.783
I, I hired a PL in Portland.

29:12.668 --> 29:15.045
This is less than an hour away.

29:15.171 --> 29:17.378
If you leave now,
you can be there before dark.

29:20.509 --> 29:22.010
Thank you.

29:23.554 --> 29:24.964
I hope she has some answers.

29:25.139 --> 29:27.630
And I hope you come back
and tell me what they are.

29:27.975 --> 29:29.351
Of course.

29:29.477 --> 29:31.593
You know, no matter what
she says or what happens,

29:31.687 --> 29:33.348
I'm coming back.

29:37.693 --> 29:39.069
I promise.

29:43.699 --> 29:45.485
You're notjust my partner, either.

29:49.372 --> 29:51.033
I'll be here.

29:53.709 --> 29:54.869
Yeah.

30:45.428 --> 30:46.793
Excuse me.

30:48.431 --> 30:49.921
Are you Lucy Ripley?

30:52.977 --> 30:54.308
My God.

30:55.980 --> 30:57.595
You're really here.

31:00.484 --> 31:01.985
Did someone tell you
that I was coming here?

31:03.612 --> 31:04.943
You did,

31:05.781 --> 31:07.282
27 years ago.

31:16.459 --> 31:18.415
You don't remember anything
about that day?

31:19.503 --> 31:20.618
No.

31:21.839 --> 31:23.579
(SIGHS) I'm sorry, honey.

31:24.633 --> 31:26.339
Guess that means they found you.

31:26.469 --> 31:27.584
Who found me?

31:27.678 --> 31:30.841
Don't know. Not sure you did either.

31:31.640 --> 31:34.131
But 27 years ago,
when you arrived on my doorstep,

31:34.268 --> 31:35.849
you were on the run.

31:35.978 --> 31:38.640
Scared. Asking all kinds of crazy questions.

31:38.939 --> 31:40.645
You said you had my memories.

31:41.317 --> 31:42.352
I did? I said that?

31:42.485 --> 31:43.520
Yes.

31:43.652 --> 31:45.233
I couldn't believe it, but...

31:45.321 --> 31:46.936
Okay, so,

31:48.949 --> 31:51.656
if I'm not you, and I'm not Audrey Parker...

31:51.952 --> 31:53.988
I don't know who you are.

31:55.331 --> 31:58.164
And I... I told you lwas from Haven, Maine?

31:58.375 --> 32:00.206
Yes, you said that you'd been
staying there for a while,

32:00.336 --> 32:02.998
and you were helping people
with strange troubles.

32:04.173 --> 32:05.834
Yeah, that seems to be a pattern.

32:06.050 --> 32:07.540
Someone died.

32:08.010 --> 32:09.796
You discovered a terrible secret,

32:10.012 --> 32:13.345
how all these troubles started,
and how you could finally stop them.

32:13.641 --> 32:16.348
So that's why
these people wanted to find me.

32:16.519 --> 32:18.680
No, they were trying to erase you.

32:20.356 --> 32:21.687
Well, they succeeded,

32:23.818 --> 32:25.274
because I don't remember anything

32:25.361 --> 32:26.817
that you're talking about.

32:28.697 --> 32:31.609
You said that
I could never tell anyone about you,

32:31.700 --> 32:32.860
that we'd even met.

32:33.035 --> 32:35.196
Otherwise, they would come
and erase me, too.

32:35.371 --> 32:38.454
And you said the only person
that I could tell the story to was you,

32:38.541 --> 32:40.497
if you came back.

32:40.876 --> 32:42.707
You said you'd need to know.

32:43.045 --> 32:44.376
Thank you.

All these years, I've been waiting.

32:49.260 --> 32:50.591
I hope I did the right thing.

32:51.095 --> 32:52.380
Hey, what do you mean?

32:53.889 --> 32:56.096
A few months after you left,
a man came here.

32:56.559 --> 32:58.720
Said there were people after you
and that he could help.

32:59.270 --> 33:00.885
But there was something about him I...

33:02.690 --> 33:03.770
I didn't tell him anything.

33:04.275 --> 33:05.560
And he was from Haven?

33:05.734 --> 33:06.985
Do you remember his name?

33:07.069 --> 33:09.401

33:13.242 --> 33:14.778

33:19.582 --> 33:21.538
So basically, your dad buys the Cape Rouge

33:21.625 --> 33:26.085
and arranges for the guy to lose it to you
in a poker game on your 21st birthday.

33:28.883 --> 33:30.089
Yeah.

33:30.217 --> 33:32.299
Gotta be the smartest plan
he ever came up with.

33:33.721 --> 33:35.882
Maybe he was finally trying
to do something nice for you.

33:36.307 --> 33:38.047
No, more likely, there's a catch.

33:39.143 --> 33:40.599
A big one.

33:57.453 --> 33:58.568
I got something.

34:06.795 --> 34:08.171
That's good. Good.

34:09.673 --> 34:10.924
Give me some slack.

34:11.342 --> 34:12.627
A little more.

34:12.760 --> 34:14.591
That's it. Good, good, good.

34:15.638 --> 34:18.630
All the time, the bastard had it
stashed right under my nose.

had hidden below decks.

35:26.041 --> 35:28.032

35:28.544 --> 35:31.081
Lucy Ripley. I found her.

35:31.714 --> 35:34.080
What... What did she say?

35:35.009 --> 35:36.670
That she knew your father.

35:37.094 --> 35:39.380
That he visited her 27 years ago.

35:39.722 --> 35:40.882

35:41.056 --> 35:42.216

35:44.560 --> 35:45.925

Wow. Buddy.

35:52.860 --> 35:54.396
My feelings are actually hurt.

36:26.602 --> 36:27.967
Get him.

36:55.172 --> 36:57.003
He's a freaking Army Ranger. He's fine.

37:03.931 --> 37:05.842

Why didn't you tell me
what I was going after?

38:12.124 --> 38:13.204
Did you get it?

38:13.459 --> 38:16.292
No. Before I realized, it was too late.

38:18.088 --> 38:20.124
If I'd have told you what it really was,

38:20.716 --> 38:24.254
you would have been scared
or you'd just kill Duke, right?

38:25.971 --> 38:27.086
He has it?

38:29.558 --> 38:30.593
He cut me.

38:32.311 --> 38:33.551
What should we do?

Nathan. What are you doing here?

38:45.324 --> 38:47.064
He's probably here to shut us down.

38:49.077 --> 38:50.487
I'm not gonna shut you down, Dwight.

38:51.288 --> 38:53.950
The town finds out that
you're at this kind of meeting...

38:54.082 --> 38:55.788
That's risky, Nathan.

Oh, I can't worry about
what the town thinks anymore.

it didn't last for very long.

39:37.459 --> 39:40.166

Is there anything in that box
that might actually tell us why?

39:43.298 --> 39:44.378
Well, maybe this ledger?

There's some names, there's some
dates, hundreds of years old.

39:48.136 --> 39:50.718
Maybe it's a Crocker family history.

39:59.064 --> 40:01.555
It's just these last few pages, I...

40:03.068 --> 40:04.729
I feel like I recognize the writing.

It's probablyjust
because it's as bad as mine, but...

"Duke, if you're reading this,
then I haven't survived."

Wait, lthought...
I thought that your dad died in an accident.

why did he want you to kill me?
