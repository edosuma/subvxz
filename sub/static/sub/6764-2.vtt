01:35.595 --> 01:36.926
Hurry, hurry, go.

01:37.097 --> 01:40.828
<i>Dear Mom and Dad,
autumn has come early to Minnesota</i>

01:41.000 --> 01:44.663
<i>and I never realized how much
I missed the change of seasons.</i>

01:46.840 --> 01:48.364
Who am I kidding?

01:48.541 --> 01:51.305
It hasn't stopped raining in a week,
it's 40 degrees outside

01:51.478 --> 01:54.276
and they haven't turned on the heat
in the dorm yet.

01:55.515 --> 01:57.380
Man, is it wet out there.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.483
Yeah, well, what's new?

01:59.652 --> 02:01.916
We heard a weather report in the car.
It may snow tonight.

02:02.322 --> 02:03.346
Great.

02:03.523 --> 02:04.717
Better get used to it, Brenda.

02:04.891 --> 02:06.415
Bikini season's over.

02:06.593 --> 02:08.925
See you at dinner.
It's turkey tetrazzini.

02:09.095 --> 02:12.531
Guaranteed to fill you out, not up.
See you.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.874
Hey, are you okay?

02:23.042 --> 02:24.339
Yeah.

02:24.511 --> 02:27.309
It's probably just the weather.
I'm not used to it anymore.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.504
It's probably that poster.

02:28.681 --> 02:32.173
If you keep staring at it, you're gonna
get more and more homesick.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.784
I guess I have to admit

02:35.955 --> 02:38.719
it didn't take long to get used
to the good life out there.

02:38.892 --> 02:41.292
Well, come on, Bren,
you were never really one of them.

02:41.794 --> 02:43.193
What is that supposed to mean?

02:43.363 --> 02:44.887
Well, you came back, didn't you?

02:46.499 --> 02:50.060
Speaking of the good life,
I've got a date tonight.

02:50.236 --> 02:51.828
Congratulations. Anyone I know?

02:52.005 --> 02:53.472
I don't think so.
He's from Rochester.

02:53.640 --> 02:56.234
We met at the academic decathlon
last spring.

02:57.310 --> 02:58.504
Sounds like an interesting guy.

02:58.678 --> 02:59.770
Oh, he is.

02:59.946 --> 03:01.709
And if things go the way
I think they'll go,

03:01.881 --> 03:04.406
I might want the room to myself
for a while tonight.

03:04.584 --> 03:07.144
- I mean, if that's okay with you.
- Yeah, sure.

03:07.320 --> 03:10.289
Anyway, if this...

03:10.757 --> 03:12.987
...is hanging on the doorknob
when you come home tonight,

03:13.159 --> 03:14.990
that means "do not enter," okay?

03:15.161 --> 03:16.526
Very tasteful.

03:17.564 --> 03:18.656
Darla, are you in there?

03:18.831 --> 03:21.197
Yeah, hold on a sec.
Oh, God, that's him.

03:21.367 --> 03:22.391
I look a mess.

03:22.569 --> 03:23.627
You look great.

03:23.803 --> 03:27.637
Well, let's hope he thinks so, huh?

03:30.877 --> 03:31.935
- Hi. Come on in.
- Hi.

03:32.111 --> 03:34.579
I want you to meet my oldest friend
in the world, Brenda Walsh.

03:34.747 --> 03:36.942
- This is Dylan.
- Hi, Brenda.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.947
Hi, Dylan.

03:47.393 --> 03:50.419
<i>George party, Court 4.</i>

03:55.034 --> 03:58.333
<i>Hardaway party, Court 9.</i>

04:10.283 --> 04:11.750
Out. Forty-love.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.283
What you talking about? That's in.

04:13.453 --> 04:14.852
Out by a mile.
What are you, blind?

04:15.021 --> 04:16.249
Celeste, tell him. You saw it.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.649
Sorry, Brandon, it was out.

04:18.423 --> 04:21.552
Hey, don't apologize.
This is war we're playing here.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.320
Serve it up, Sanders. Let's go.

04:38.077 --> 04:40.068
I hate to tell you this,
we're still getting killed.

04:40.246 --> 04:41.270
"We"? Don't look at me.

04:41.447 --> 04:43.711
You guys might as well
be playing singles.

04:44.917 --> 04:48.512
Cel, hit the ball towards Brandon.
He's got a big hole in his racquet.

04:48.688 --> 04:50.383
- Okay.
- Shut up, Sanders.

04:58.898 --> 04:59.922
Oh, nice, nice.

05:01.501 --> 05:03.264
All right! Celeste Lundy.

05:03.436 --> 05:05.495
Next stop, Wimbledon.

05:05.672 --> 05:08.004
Next stop, Pacific Ocean.
I'm going swimming.

05:08.174 --> 05:09.368
- Good game.
- Good game, guys.

05:09.542 --> 05:10.566
Good game.

05:10.743 --> 05:12.506
You gotta face it, Brandon,
tennis is my game.

05:12.679 --> 05:15.477
Yeah, well, Steve, if I spent all summer
at Mommy's country club

05:15.648 --> 05:17.343
practicing with the pros
instead of working,

05:17.517 --> 05:19.144
it would be my game too.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.480
You can't face the fact
that you're never gonna beat me.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.713
Well, how about tomorrow,
same time, same place?

05:24.190 --> 05:25.555
Are you challenging me
to a rematch?

05:25.725 --> 05:27.317
You're a real quick study,
you know that?

05:27.493 --> 05:29.984
- God, do we have to?
- You're on.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.059
We have to.

05:52.852 --> 05:56.583
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea
to let Brandon use Brenda's room.

05:57.123 --> 05:59.489
How is it he can
talk us into anything?

05:59.659 --> 06:03.186
Well, we just better make sure
he doesn't drag her bed out of here.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.459
She will come home
for the holidays.

06:05.631 --> 06:07.599
And for summer vacation.

06:07.767 --> 06:11.999
But she's gone, isn't she?

06:16.709 --> 06:19.974
Do you remember the first day
we took Brenda to nursery school?

06:20.146 --> 06:21.443
Of course I do.

06:21.614 --> 06:24.640
And they made us leave her alone
in that great big room

06:24.817 --> 06:26.216
and I kissed her goodbye

06:26.386 --> 06:29.753
and then you and I stood in the hall
waiting for her to cry.

06:30.289 --> 06:32.382
But she didn't cry.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.287
But I did.

06:35.161 --> 06:36.594
Come here.

06:36.763 --> 06:39.698
Oh, and here we are again.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.500
Let me put this
in a little perspective for you.

06:42.668 --> 06:44.135
Maybe cheer you up a bit.

06:44.303 --> 06:45.736
Okay.

06:45.905 --> 06:49.636
Now, until Brandon comes home
from the beach,

06:49.809 --> 06:54.610
you and I have this big house
all to ourselves.

06:54.781 --> 06:56.908
We can party.

06:57.517 --> 07:00.509
Or maybe something else.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.588
Is this what it's gonna be like
when we're old?

07:07.360 --> 07:12.320
I mean, the two of us rattling around
in this great, big, empty house?

07:12.899 --> 07:14.059
Something like that.

07:15.368 --> 07:17.563
I don't know if I like that.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.602
But I like that.

07:33.820 --> 07:36.789
You know, Brandon,
I'm in the mood for a drink.

07:36.956 --> 07:40.483
How about some gin on the rocks?

07:42.028 --> 07:43.586
I hate this game.

07:43.763 --> 07:44.855
You just hate to lose.

07:45.031 --> 07:47.329
Deal the cards, Sanders.

07:53.172 --> 07:57.006
Jill Flemming has been the object
of every fantasy I have ever had.

07:57.176 --> 07:59.838
Do me a favor, bro.
Keep your fantasies to yourself.

08:00.546 --> 08:01.911
I can't help it.

08:02.081 --> 08:04.015
She was the fastest thing
on this beach.

08:04.183 --> 08:05.673
I can't believe
I never slept with her.

08:05.852 --> 08:07.649
Bro, you were 13 years old.

08:07.820 --> 08:08.980
That's no excuse.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.753
Come on,
fill in the blanks for me, all right?

08:11.924 --> 08:14.415
Torture your buddy a little bit.

08:14.594 --> 08:15.652
What's she like in bed?

08:15.828 --> 08:17.295
I haven't slept with her yet.

08:17.463 --> 08:19.055
Well, why the hell not?

08:19.232 --> 08:21.132
You've been hanging out for a week.
What's wrong?

08:21.300 --> 08:22.767
Nothing. It just hasn't happened yet.

08:22.935 --> 08:25.961
Wait a minute. What am I
talking to you about this for?

08:26.138 --> 08:28.038
- What are you waiting for?
- Nothing, Steve.

08:28.207 --> 08:29.538
And this is none of your business.

08:29.709 --> 08:31.040
Okay, this is none of my business.

08:31.210 --> 08:33.075
But Jill's going back
to New York in three days.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.544
- And if I was going out with her...
- Which you're not.

08:35.715 --> 08:37.842
If I was going out with her,
which I'm not,

08:38.017 --> 08:41.475
and she was sleeping in the bedroom
next to me, which she is,

08:41.654 --> 08:42.985
I would have made a move on her.

08:43.155 --> 08:46.454
Thank you for those
pearls of wisdom, Steve.

08:46.626 --> 08:48.787
Hey, you guys gonna play cards
all afternoon?

08:48.961 --> 08:50.588
We're going swimming.
Wanna come?

08:50.763 --> 08:53.755
I will, but I think young Stevie here
is gonna take a little nap

08:53.933 --> 08:55.059
before the big game tomorrow.

08:58.638 --> 09:00.663
I can beat you at cards.

09:00.840 --> 09:01.864
I can beat you at tennis.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.509
I can beat you at basketball,
volleyball, you name it.

09:06.579 --> 09:08.479
Other than hockey.

09:09.415 --> 09:11.280
And grades.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.742
I can beat you to the water.

09:14.053 --> 09:15.247
All right, you're on.

09:16.722 --> 09:17.746
On your mark.

09:18.190 --> 09:19.214
Get set.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.360
Hey, man, that's not fair.

09:33.773 --> 09:35.536
Hey, Donna, where does this go?

09:35.708 --> 09:37.266
In there.

09:40.079 --> 09:43.014
I thought the landlord said
he was having this place cleaned

09:43.182 --> 09:44.615
before we moved in.

09:44.784 --> 09:46.581
Actually, he said painted.

09:46.752 --> 09:49.482
This refrigerator looks like
a toxic-waste dump.

09:50.122 --> 09:53.319
Are you sure it's safe to leave David
alone with your mom all this time?

09:53.492 --> 09:56.188
Yeah, don't worry, they're fine.
David and I have it all worked out.

09:56.362 --> 09:58.125
She thinks he's living
at the frat with Steve.

09:58.297 --> 10:00.765
Well, let's just pray she doesn't ask
too many questions.

10:01.867 --> 10:05.826
I tell you, David, this is really wonderful
of you to be helping out like this.

10:06.005 --> 10:07.666
In fact, I can't thank you enough.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.171
It's no problem, Mrs. Martin.

10:09.342 --> 10:10.366
Well, I mean it.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.704
What would these girls have done
without you?

10:12.878 --> 10:14.368
I don't know.

10:14.547 --> 10:17.710
Especially with Dr. Martin and I taking
off for Houston day after tomorrow.

10:17.883 --> 10:21.011
I can't believe I'm actually moving
two households in one week.

10:21.187 --> 10:23.382
Could you turn that
just a little bit more that way?

10:24.590 --> 10:26.888
I mean, I know
we're only leaving for a year,

10:27.059 --> 10:29.584
but how do you leave
your whole life behind?

10:29.762 --> 10:30.820
So I figure,

10:30.997 --> 10:33.056
take everything.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.435
It's better to be safe than sorry,
that's what I always say.

10:36.602 --> 10:38.661
That's what Donna always says too.

10:39.338 --> 10:42.102
Well, I bet you can't wait
to move into the frat house, huh?

10:42.708 --> 10:44.608
Do you know which one
you're pledging yet?

10:44.777 --> 10:46.438
No, I'm really not sure yet.

10:46.612 --> 10:48.705
Well, I must say,
there's still a little part of me

10:48.881 --> 10:51.782
that wishes that Donna had decided
to move into the sorority house.

10:51.984 --> 10:56.421
I mean, I had the greatest time
in the sorority when I was in school.

10:56.922 --> 10:59.413
And then,
crime being what it is today...

10:59.592 --> 11:01.082
You sure this neighborhood is safe?

11:01.627 --> 11:03.026
Yeah, it's fine.

11:03.496 --> 11:07.398
<i>Well, entre nous,</i>

11:07.566 --> 11:09.864
Donna's daddy and I
are really relieved

11:10.036 --> 11:11.731
that you're gonna be
living close by, David.

11:12.471 --> 11:15.133
I mean, just in case the girls
need a man around the house.

11:16.242 --> 11:18.437
It's good to know you're just
a phone call away.

11:18.611 --> 11:21.774
Yup, just a phone call away.

11:24.050 --> 11:27.144
I can't believe I have to go back
to the city in three days.

11:27.319 --> 11:30.482
Why is it all New Yorkers
refer to New York as "the city"

11:30.656 --> 11:33.022
as if there are no other cities
in the world?

11:33.192 --> 11:35.023
Because there isn't.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.593
Are you telling me you prefer

11:36.762 --> 11:40.357
your six-story walkup
in Greenwich Village to this?

11:40.533 --> 11:41.761
No, don't get me wrong.

11:41.934 --> 11:45.233
Like the song goes, I love L.A.

11:45.404 --> 11:47.463
But I wanna go home.

11:48.107 --> 11:50.735
This week has been great.

11:51.143 --> 11:52.235
You're great.

11:53.079 --> 11:55.547
You know, they have colleges
out here. You could transfer.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.684
And lose a ton of credits?
No, thank you.

11:58.851 --> 12:01.684
Besides, I only have
one more year left.

12:03.122 --> 12:04.589
Well, I'm gonna miss you.

12:13.632 --> 12:18.069
Brandon, let's stay on the side streets
before we get on the freeway.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.364
This is going a little fast.

12:20.539 --> 12:22.029
Jill, you're going home in three days.

12:22.208 --> 12:24.233
How slow do you wanna go?

12:24.410 --> 12:26.810
Maybe I just don't wanna start
something that I can't finish.

12:27.379 --> 12:28.846
Don't worry about that.

12:29.014 --> 12:31.847
I've been told I'm a real good closer.

12:40.693 --> 12:43.389
Saved by the proverbial bell.

12:52.438 --> 12:53.666
- Dylan.
- In the flesh.

12:53.839 --> 12:55.932
How are you, brother?

12:56.108 --> 12:57.939
- I'm good.
- What's going on, man?

12:58.110 --> 12:59.600
- When did you get back?
- A while ago.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.646
- What took you so long to get here?
- Traffic's a bitch.

13:02.815 --> 13:04.544
Steve, get down here.
Frenchy's back.

13:04.717 --> 13:06.617
Big pool.

13:09.822 --> 13:11.881
You guys, you actually have food
in the refrigerator.

13:12.057 --> 13:13.319
You have Jill to thank for that.

13:13.492 --> 13:15.585
When I got here, they were living
on beer and ketchup.

13:15.761 --> 13:19.162
I'll tell you, you guys really lucked out.
This is a great house.

13:19.331 --> 13:20.355
And the landlady's cute.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.023
Yeah, well, enjoy it while it lasts.

13:22.201 --> 13:24.192
Day after tomorrow
we all turn back into pumpkins.

13:24.370 --> 13:26.668
You can hang here till then if you want.
Everyone else is.

13:26.839 --> 13:29.569
No, thanks. I've got three months'
worth of mail piled up at my house.

13:29.742 --> 13:31.767
I gotta deal with it sometime.

13:32.845 --> 13:33.869
You got any sodas?

13:34.046 --> 13:35.741
In the fridge in the garage.
I'll get it.

13:35.915 --> 13:37.280
Thanks.

13:38.050 --> 13:39.813
I'll tell you, Brandon, you did all right.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.282
That Jill is something.

13:41.453 --> 13:43.887
Thank you, man.
Too bad she lives in New York.

13:44.056 --> 13:45.887
Don't sweat it.
You'll be starting school.

13:46.058 --> 13:48.185
I hear rumors there are girls there.

13:48.360 --> 13:49.657
Don't tell Steve that.

13:50.529 --> 13:52.656
You have nothing to worry about.

13:52.832 --> 13:53.890
- He's a liar.
- He's lying.

13:54.066 --> 13:56.091
- He's lying.
- I already said that.

13:56.902 --> 13:59.370
So, Dylan, tell us about Europe.
Kelly said it was great.

13:59.538 --> 14:00.698
She did?

14:02.441 --> 14:03.465
You sound surprised.

14:03.642 --> 14:07.305
Yeah, well, things aren't exactly
copasetic with me and Kelly right now.

14:07.479 --> 14:08.673
You're kidding. What happened?

14:08.848 --> 14:11.282
I think maybe we got
on each other's nerves a little bit.

14:11.450 --> 14:13.441
What, Kelly got on your nerves?
What a surprise.

14:13.619 --> 14:15.246
Hey, maybe it was me, okay?
I don't know.

14:15.421 --> 14:16.615
Have you seen her? Is she back?

14:16.789 --> 14:17.915
Yeah. She got back last week.

14:18.090 --> 14:19.751
Just in time
for Brenda's goodbye party.

14:19.925 --> 14:22.155
Oh, yeah, man.
I can't believe Bren's gone.

14:22.328 --> 14:23.352
- How's she doing?
- Yeah?

14:23.529 --> 14:25.463
So far, so good.

15:09.575 --> 15:10.974
Yes!

15:11.677 --> 15:14.441
- Serve it to his backhand, baby.
- He doesn't have a backhand.

15:14.613 --> 15:16.205
Just serve the ball.

15:24.623 --> 15:26.921
Yes! That's the match.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.889
Good job, sweetheart.

15:29.061 --> 15:30.756
Came through in the clutch.
Good game, kids.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.557
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, good game.

15:32.731 --> 15:34.790
Come on, come on.
I'm just getting warmed up here.

15:34.967 --> 15:37.128
Forget it, Steve.
Just accept it, they won.

15:37.303 --> 15:39.362
Oh, no, no, no, if Steve wants
to get beaten again,

15:39.538 --> 15:41.699
I really think we should do our best
to accommodate him.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.341
Come on,
let's quit while we're ahead.

15:43.509 --> 15:46.307
Would you like to put money on this?
Make it a little more interesting.

15:46.478 --> 15:48.878
I don't wanna put any money on it.
You know what I'm gonna do?

15:49.048 --> 15:50.538
I'm gonna ruin your day for free.

15:50.716 --> 15:52.149
Let's forget it. I'm wiped out.

15:52.318 --> 15:53.683
Me too. I don't wanna play anymore.

15:53.852 --> 15:55.683
Come on, baby,
this is just getting fun.

15:55.854 --> 15:57.685
Come on, one more game.

15:57.856 --> 15:59.517
Come on.

16:03.729 --> 16:07.028
Aim the syringe, pinch the arm

16:07.199 --> 16:10.293
and inject.

16:11.770 --> 16:13.931
How am I gonna ever do this?

16:14.840 --> 16:17.604
Andrea, what are you doing
with that syringe?

16:17.776 --> 16:19.141
My grandmother's a diabetic.

16:19.311 --> 16:22.747
The oral insulin wasn't working,
so I get to play doctor.

16:22.915 --> 16:25.975
Well, why don't I give you
some pointers, doc?

16:26.151 --> 16:28.210
You gotta do it faster
and be more aggressive.

16:28.387 --> 16:30.218
How do you know?

16:30.389 --> 16:32.448
I was almost a medic
when I was in the Navy.

16:32.624 --> 16:34.592
My mother was so proud,

16:34.760 --> 16:37.251
thought she'd finally be able to say,
"My son, the doctor. "

16:38.130 --> 16:39.757
- So, what happened?
- What happened?

16:39.932 --> 16:41.229
I was great with oranges,

16:41.400 --> 16:43.493
but when it came to sticking needles
in arms and legs,

16:43.669 --> 16:45.864
well, my stomach just wasn't in it.

16:46.038 --> 16:49.030
So it was off to the galley.
She never forgave me.

16:49.208 --> 16:51.870
Well, there are a lot of doctors
in this world,

16:52.044 --> 16:54.308
but there's only one man
who can make a megaburger.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.277
- That's right.
- That's right.

16:56.448 --> 16:59.645
Nat, some things never change.
Do more talking than cooking.

16:59.818 --> 17:00.910
Hey, Dylan.

17:01.086 --> 17:02.917
How are you doing?

17:03.088 --> 17:04.919
- Andrea.
- Dylan, welcome home.

17:05.089 --> 17:07.080
I thought you weren't back
for another week or two.

17:07.259 --> 17:08.385
Well, plans change, you know.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.584
You want something?

17:09.795 --> 17:12.093
Coffee, black.
And you have any peach pie?

17:12.263 --> 17:14.824
- I think I can dig some up.
- Yeah.

17:15.901 --> 17:17.993
So how do you like
Kelly's new apartment?

17:19.038 --> 17:20.266
She got an apartment?

17:20.439 --> 17:21.633
Yeah, didn't you know?

17:21.807 --> 17:23.205
No.

17:24.242 --> 17:27.144
Well, she moved in with David
and Donna down at the beach.

17:27.679 --> 17:28.839
Haven't you talked to them?

17:29.014 --> 17:30.504
No, I just got back last night.

17:32.484 --> 17:34.179
So when are you heading up north?

17:34.353 --> 17:36.617
- North?
- Berkeley.

17:36.789 --> 17:37.813
Oh, yeah.

17:37.990 --> 17:39.753
Well, actually, I'm not. I didn't get in.

17:40.692 --> 17:42.091
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

17:42.261 --> 17:44.092
It's not that big a deal.
Don't worry about it.

17:44.263 --> 17:46.663
But what about you?
When are you leaving for Yale?

17:47.366 --> 17:49.197
You really are out of the loop.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.799
Donna, you've got to
tell your mother the truth.

17:56.975 --> 17:58.408
I can't.

17:58.577 --> 18:01.205
Well, she's gonna find out
sooner or later.

18:01.380 --> 18:02.972
What if she calls
and David picks up?

18:03.148 --> 18:05.708
So we'll get two phone lines.

18:05.884 --> 18:09.684
Okay, well, what if she just stops by
one night and finds him there?

18:09.855 --> 18:13.791
Kelly, she's moving to Houston.
It's not like she can just pop in.

18:13.959 --> 18:17.087
You've got this all figured out,
don't you?

18:19.565 --> 18:21.897
Lying is the only way.
If I tell her the truth,

18:22.067 --> 18:25.127
she'll make me move out.
It's as simple as that.

18:25.304 --> 18:27.568
Oh, my God. He's back.

18:27.739 --> 18:32.142
Well, maybe someone else
has the exact same Porsche.

18:32.878 --> 18:35.847
Right, with the exact
same license plate?

18:36.515 --> 18:38.506
He didn't even call.

18:38.684 --> 18:40.117
Well, he doesn't have our number.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.446
Come to think of it,
he doesn't even know where we live.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.249
It's just as well. We have
nothing to say to each other.

18:45.424 --> 18:48.951
Come on, let's just get out of here.
We'll get some food somewhere else.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.688
You mean to tell me you're not gonna
even go inside and say hello?

18:51.864 --> 18:52.888
No.

18:53.065 --> 18:55.363
Not after what he did to me
in Europe.

18:55.534 --> 18:58.094
It couldn't have been that bad.

18:58.704 --> 18:59.932
It's a long story.

19:00.105 --> 19:01.868
Just drive.

19:04.276 --> 19:05.937
So tell me what happened.

19:06.545 --> 19:09.912
You have to promise not to tell
anybody, not even David.

19:10.082 --> 19:11.947
I promise.

19:12.117 --> 19:13.448
All right.

19:14.186 --> 19:17.781
<i>Well, we were having a great time.
France was beautiful.</i>

19:17.956 --> 19:20.652
<i>Just like the paintings.
Everything was perfect.</i>

19:20.826 --> 19:24.125
<i>But then Dylan found out
he didn't get into Berkeley.</i>

19:24.296 --> 19:26.924
<i>He got so moody and quiet.</i>

19:27.099 --> 19:30.728
<i>All he'd do was sit and read
and drink espresso.</i>

19:30.903 --> 19:34.669
<i>I couldn't stand it anymore.
I got bored out of my mind.</i>

19:38.210 --> 19:39.541
You wanna quit staring at me?

19:40.512 --> 19:42.639
- What?
- I wanna do something.

19:42.814 --> 19:44.611
Can't we just do something?

19:44.783 --> 19:46.546
I'm reading, do you mind?

19:47.119 --> 19:48.143
Let's go back to Paris.

19:48.320 --> 19:51.016
We'll go shopping, we'll go sightseeing,
anything to get out of here.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.750
Hey, you wanna go to Paris,
go to Paris.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.154
Send me a postcard.

19:56.328 --> 19:57.693
Dylan.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.330
What do you want me to say, Kelly?

20:00.566 --> 20:02.227
Nothing.

20:07.105 --> 20:09.300
So I went to Paris
for a couple of days.

20:09.474 --> 20:10.805
And then what happened?

20:10.976 --> 20:13.774
When I got back,
he was still in his usual spot,

20:13.946 --> 20:15.413
still drinking coffee.

20:16.415 --> 20:18.645
<i>But he wasn't reading.</i>

20:18.817 --> 20:20.910
<i>He was with
this gorgeous French girl.</i>

20:21.086 --> 20:22.883
<i>I could tell
by looking at the two of them</i>

20:23.055 --> 20:25.523
<i>that they'd gotten very friendly.</i>

20:28.193 --> 20:30.093
Hi, Kel. How you doing?

20:30.562 --> 20:31.756
This is Brigitte.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.190
How do you do?

20:37.169 --> 20:38.659
She doesn't speak any English.

20:39.471 --> 20:40.631
How convenient.

20:56.588 --> 20:57.816
Are you laughing at me?

20:57.990 --> 21:00.083
No, we're not, Kel. It's just a joke.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.056
In that case, tell me what you said.

21:02.227 --> 21:04.058
Because it loses something
in the translation.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.792
No, no, stay seated.

21:13.038 --> 21:14.562
You slept with her, didn't you?

21:14.740 --> 21:16.674
No, Kel, I didn't sleep with her.

21:20.846 --> 21:23.110
Hey, hey, what has gotten into you?

21:23.282 --> 21:26.115
I go away for three days
and suddenly you're all cheered up.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.010
If you wanna believe I slept with her,
that's fine.

21:29.187 --> 21:31.052
You can believe anything you want.
I don't care.

21:31.223 --> 21:32.520
But you're right about one thing.

21:32.691 --> 21:35.683
With you out of the picture, things
were more upbeat. You know why?

21:35.861 --> 21:38.159
I didn't have to listen
to all your complaining and moaning

21:38.330 --> 21:40.457
and finally
I got some peace and quiet.

21:40.632 --> 21:43.294
Fine, you want peace and quiet?
I'll give you peace and quiet.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.629
Try not to choke on it.

21:49.408 --> 21:52.866
And I didn't talk to him
for three days.

21:53.045 --> 21:54.171
Kelly, you can't let this go.

21:54.346 --> 21:56.507
We've gotta go back there
and you have to talk to him.

21:56.682 --> 22:00.982
Donna, the last person I wanna see
right now is Dylan McKay.

22:07.826 --> 22:10.317
- Damn it!
- Yes.

22:18.704 --> 22:19.966
Sorry.

22:20.138 --> 22:22.800
Oh, what's the matter?
Getting a little tired, poor baby?

22:24.176 --> 22:25.438
Just play the game, Sanders.

22:34.453 --> 22:35.681
What the hell was that?

22:35.854 --> 22:38.084
What's the problem?
If you can't stand the heat...

22:38.256 --> 22:40.315
Give me a break.
You aimed the ball right at her.

22:40.492 --> 22:42.392
Hey, look,
I'm just trying to win, all right?

22:42.561 --> 22:43.619
I don't wanna play anymore.

22:43.795 --> 22:45.786
Hey, come on, it's 4-4. Shake it off.

22:45.964 --> 22:47.522
He's an idiot.

22:55.574 --> 22:57.007
Damn it, Steve!

22:57.175 --> 22:58.699
What the hell's the matter with you?

22:58.877 --> 23:00.538
- I didn't mean to hit you.
- But you did.

23:00.712 --> 23:03.613
- Will you quiet? I'm not talking to you.
- Man, you've got a problem.

23:03.782 --> 23:06.012
- Get out of my face.
- It's supposed to be fun.

23:06.184 --> 23:08.709
- I know it's a big thing...
- Stop!

23:10.555 --> 23:13.752
- Jill, what's the matter?
- You're just as bad as he is, Brandon.

23:13.925 --> 23:15.517
This is supposed to be a tennis game,

23:15.694 --> 23:18.390
not some kind of macho fight
to the death.

23:25.971 --> 23:27.131
I'm sorry, man.

23:27.305 --> 23:28.966
Me too, brother.

23:37.716 --> 23:40.708
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

23:40.886 --> 23:43.548
You're leaving over a tennis game?

23:44.489 --> 23:47.652
Look, Jill, I'm sorry.
I know Steve got a little out of hand.

23:47.826 --> 23:50.818
- Yeah, so did you, Brandon.
- It was just a guy thing.

23:50.996 --> 23:54.557
I know what it was, thank you.
Doesn't mean I have to put up with it.

23:54.733 --> 23:56.701
Well, it doesn't mean
you have to leave, either.

23:56.868 --> 23:58.893
Don't tell me what to do.

23:59.070 --> 24:02.870
I'm not telling you what to do.
I just don't want you to leave, that's all.

24:05.710 --> 24:07.769
No, just get away from me.

24:08.313 --> 24:09.678
Okay.

24:11.850 --> 24:13.317
Do you mind telling me
what I've done?

24:13.485 --> 24:17.649
- Please, Brandon, just go.
- Okay.

24:26.131 --> 24:27.325
I don't believe it.

24:27.499 --> 24:30.093
How is it possible
that I got locked out of every course

24:30.268 --> 24:31.292
in the Drama Department?

24:31.470 --> 24:33.529
It's a big school.
Freshmen never get what they want.

24:33.705 --> 24:36.139
- It's like paying dues.
- Yeah, I guess so.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.776
Besides, who cares?
There's a floor party tonight.

24:38.944 --> 24:40.605
That's what college
is really for, right?

24:40.779 --> 24:42.144
Katie, if I really wanted to party,

24:42.314 --> 24:44.976
I could have stayed in L.A.
Where they really know how it's done.

24:45.150 --> 24:49.143
Brenda, if you hate it here so much,
why'd you come back?

24:50.555 --> 24:53.285
I don't believe this.
It's the middle of the afternoon.

24:53.458 --> 24:55.449
Well, we know
what Darla's studying, right?

24:55.627 --> 24:57.254
See you later, Bren.

24:57.429 --> 24:58.953
Bye.

25:10.308 --> 25:12.776
<i>- Hi, this is Kelly.
- And this is Donna.</i>

25:12.944 --> 25:17.040
<i>And we're here in our new
beach house and you're not.</i>

25:17.215 --> 25:19.615
<i>But leave a message
and we'll invite you over.</i>

25:19.784 --> 25:21.445
<i>Yeah.</i>

25:45.677 --> 25:47.872
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:49.648 --> 25:52.242
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.

25:52.417 --> 25:55.944
- I'm sorry. I guess I overreacted.
- No. No, I'm sorry.

25:56.121 --> 25:58.783
I think I probably came on
a little too strong.

25:58.957 --> 26:01.084
No, you didn't. It's me.

26:01.927 --> 26:06.023
I've been kind of upset lately.
That's why I came out here.

26:06.197 --> 26:08.722
To get out of New York for a while.

26:09.868 --> 26:12.302
Anything you wanna talk about?

26:13.572 --> 26:15.506
Not really.

26:15.674 --> 26:17.301
Okay.

26:19.644 --> 26:21.168
So are you still leaving?

26:23.315 --> 26:24.839
No.

26:25.617 --> 26:29.212
- I'm staying one more night.
- Good.

26:29.788 --> 26:31.415
Listen.

26:33.625 --> 26:36.321
I'm not gonna try to push you
into anything.

26:44.502 --> 26:45.764
Are you okay?

26:45.937 --> 26:47.666
Yeah, I'll live.

26:48.840 --> 26:50.307
I'm sorry.

26:51.076 --> 26:54.739
Apologies.
They seem to be the order of the day.

26:55.914 --> 26:58.075
So anyone for some tennis?

26:59.651 --> 27:02.518
Come on, Sanders.
The least you can do is make us lunch.

27:02.687 --> 27:03.949
Buy us all lunch.

27:04.122 --> 27:05.453
- There you go.
- Yeah.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.592
You guys gotta be kidding.

27:07.759 --> 27:09.886
No, no. I thought you owe me lunch.
You owe me lunch.

27:10.061 --> 27:12.393
- Let's talk about that last serve.
- Let's not talk about it.

27:12.564 --> 27:14.327
- Let's not.
- Come on, let's talk about it.

27:14.499 --> 27:17.366
- Enough.
- I wanna talk about it.

27:21.272 --> 27:24.901
Oh, God. The macaroni and cheese
is really getting to me.

27:25.076 --> 27:28.477
You know,
if it's this hard to put these jeans on,

27:28.647 --> 27:30.672
how is Dylan going to get them off?

27:31.082 --> 27:34.279
Funny. Listen, about tonight.

27:34.452 --> 27:36.249
Can you spend the night
in his room?

27:36.421 --> 27:38.855
I really have to get some sleep.
I'm starting to see double.

27:39.024 --> 27:40.958
Yeah, sure. Sorry.

27:41.760 --> 27:43.352
Darla,
can I borrow your black platforms?

27:43.528 --> 27:44.825
Oh, I'm wearing them, sorry.

27:44.996 --> 27:48.796
God. Everything I have is so preppy.
What do you think, Brenda?

27:48.967 --> 27:51.868
Don't ask her. I mean,
she thinks we're all way too preppy.

27:52.037 --> 27:53.061
I do not.

27:53.238 --> 27:55.229
You should have seen her
before she went Hollywood.

27:55.407 --> 27:59.173
Crewneck sweaters, loafers
and get this, knee socks.

27:59.678 --> 28:02.340
- I never wore knee socks.
- Oh, you lie.

28:02.514 --> 28:05.506
I'm taking your lipstick.
I'll bring it right back.

28:07.352 --> 28:11.379
Bren, are you sure
you won't come with us?

28:11.556 --> 28:14.821
- I'm just not in the mood for it.
- What's the matter with you?

28:14.993 --> 28:18.451
People are gonna think you're
some kind of wonk or something.

28:18.630 --> 28:21.690
I just never thought
that I would be this homesick.

28:21.866 --> 28:24.596
Look, I'm going downstairs
to that party

28:24.769 --> 28:27.795
and I expect you to put on one of those
hot little numbers from Beverly Hills

28:27.972 --> 28:29.439
all of us would kill for

28:29.607 --> 28:31.199
and come downstairs and join us.

28:31.376 --> 28:34.573
Stop feeling sorry for yourself, Bren.

28:34.746 --> 28:38.944
- Thanks, Darla.
- Sure. What are friends for?

28:52.163 --> 28:54.529
Go ahead and call him.
You know you want to.

28:54.699 --> 28:57.167
- I do not.
- Yes, you do.

28:57.335 --> 28:59.064
He cheated on me.

28:59.237 --> 29:02.604
And now it's time for you
to go crawling back to him.

29:02.774 --> 29:05.208
That is disgusting.

29:05.910 --> 29:07.844
Besides,
I don't actually know that he cheated.

29:08.546 --> 29:10.241
Maybe it was all my fault.

29:10.415 --> 29:12.883
Oh, God. I feel so guilty.

29:13.618 --> 29:15.483
What do you have
to feel guilty about?

29:16.688 --> 29:19.316
There's a little something
I haven't told you yet.

29:19.858 --> 29:20.882
What?

29:21.059 --> 29:24.358
There was this cute bartender
at the café in the hotel.

29:24.529 --> 29:25.791
<i>His name was Gaston.</i>

29:25.964 --> 29:28.091
<i>Gaston?
Like in Beauty and the Beast?</i>

29:28.266 --> 29:30.097
<i>Yeah, but he was no beast.</i>

29:31.703 --> 29:33.398
<i>After what Dylan did to me,</i>

29:33.571 --> 29:35.937
<i>I decided to give him a taste
of his own medicine.</i>

29:36.107 --> 29:39.702
- You did? What'd you do?
- I was just about to tell you.

29:39.878 --> 29:43.006
See, Gaston had been bugging me
to go for a drive with him.

29:43.181 --> 29:44.944
Finally, I said yes.

29:45.116 --> 29:47.949
Dylan was so buried in his book
he didn't even know I'd left.

29:48.586 --> 29:52.750
<i>When I got back to the hotel,
Dylan wasn't in the room.</i>

29:52.924 --> 29:55.757
<i>But I knew where to find him.</i>

29:59.564 --> 30:02.192
- You know what time it is?
- No.

30:02.367 --> 30:03.925
Where the hell you been all night?

30:04.402 --> 30:07.166
What do you care when you have
Brigitte to keep you company?

30:07.338 --> 30:09.067
Don't push me, Kel.

30:09.240 --> 30:10.901
Who's whining
and complaining now?

30:11.075 --> 30:13.873
I'm just asking where you've been
for the last five hours.

30:14.045 --> 30:16.138
I went for a drive
if it's any of your business.

30:16.748 --> 30:18.909
- You and the bartender?
- Yes.

30:19.083 --> 30:22.075
And he took me back to his apartment
and I had a great time.

30:25.623 --> 30:27.454
So is it true what they say then,
you know?

30:27.625 --> 30:31.026
About the French lovers?
Was it good?

30:31.596 --> 30:33.461
Very good.

30:37.402 --> 30:39.734
<i>- You hit Dylan?
- Yeah.</i>

30:39.904 --> 30:42.202
- And you slept with Gaston?
- Of course not.

30:42.373 --> 30:44.170
What were you doing
till 2 in the morning?

30:44.642 --> 30:47.668
He drove me around the French
countryside for, like, three hours.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.810
Finally I got him to take me back
to the hotel.

30:50.982 --> 30:53.143
And you let Dylan think
you slept with him?

30:53.585 --> 30:55.212
Yeah.

30:55.386 --> 30:57.547
So I took the bullet train
back to Paris the next day

30:57.722 --> 30:59.747
and I came home a week early.

31:00.325 --> 31:01.758
You've got to tell Dylan the truth.

31:01.926 --> 31:04.861
Oh, right, like he'd believe me.

31:05.029 --> 31:06.189
What was I thinking?

31:07.332 --> 31:11.996
I don't know.
France does strange things to people.

31:12.170 --> 31:13.728
Maybe it's something in the water.

31:17.976 --> 31:21.275
It's the best bottle
in my father's cellar.

31:23.548 --> 31:25.675
Think he'll miss it?

31:25.850 --> 31:28.444
No, I can always blame it on you
and Steve.

31:28.987 --> 31:32.548
No, blame it on Steve.
We blame everything on Steve.

31:33.558 --> 31:35.253
Brandon?

31:37.161 --> 31:39.493
I meant what I said last night.

31:39.664 --> 31:42.895
And if we're going to do this,
please go slow.

31:43.835 --> 31:45.962
I like it slow.

31:55.046 --> 31:57.139
I can't.

31:59.651 --> 32:01.744
What's wrong?

32:03.488 --> 32:05.046
Hey.

32:06.958 --> 32:08.289
You can trust me.

32:12.130 --> 32:14.826
Okay, here goes.

32:17.535 --> 32:22.063
Six months ago,
I was at this little gallery in Tribeca.

32:23.942 --> 32:27.173
It got late,
so I went out to look for a cab.

32:28.713 --> 32:30.305
Probably
shouldn't have been there alone.

32:30.481 --> 32:33.041
It's what everyone says, anyway.

32:34.585 --> 32:38.578
There weren't any cabs,
so I started walking.

32:42.260 --> 32:45.491
I heard these footsteps behind me.

32:47.332 --> 32:49.095
And this guy grabbed me.

32:50.535 --> 32:52.469
He had a knife.

32:54.505 --> 32:56.803
I had to do what he wanted me to.
I didn't have any choice.

32:56.975 --> 33:00.570
Hey, hey, hey, come on.
Don't have to say any more.

33:09.087 --> 33:11.055
I wish I would've known, I...

33:11.222 --> 33:13.417
I don't know, maybe I could've...

33:13.591 --> 33:16.856
- Could've helped or something.
- No, you did and you did help.

33:17.028 --> 33:18.928
Just being with you guys,
I felt like I was back

33:19.097 --> 33:20.792
in the land of the living again.

33:22.100 --> 33:23.658
But then watching you and Steve

33:23.835 --> 33:27.236
try to tear each other's heads off
on the tennis court...

33:28.272 --> 33:30.001
I don't know, it just got to me.

33:30.174 --> 33:33.041
I'm not a violent guy.
Neither is Steve.

33:33.578 --> 33:35.068
I know that.

33:37.915 --> 33:39.280
Telling someone you were raped

33:39.450 --> 33:42.419
is not exactly the greatest way
to start a relationship.

33:42.587 --> 33:45.021
Well, it's better than
not telling someone.

33:47.959 --> 33:49.859
Would you do me a favor?

33:50.028 --> 33:51.427
Anything.

33:52.764 --> 33:54.925
Would you sleep with me tonight?

33:56.234 --> 33:58.600
Are you sure that's what you want?

33:58.770 --> 34:01.500
I wanna sleep with you.

34:01.672 --> 34:03.367
Just sleep.

34:06.611 --> 34:08.909
I wanna feel your arms around me
and know what it's like

34:09.080 --> 34:13.176
to be close with someone again
without being afraid.

34:13.618 --> 34:15.779
Well, you don't have
to be afraid of me.

34:27.965 --> 34:31.422
- You guys, Brenda's sleeping.
- Good.

34:31.601 --> 34:32.933
- Katie.
- I'm sorry.

34:33.103 --> 34:34.400
I know she's your friend and all,

34:34.572 --> 34:36.563
but have you ever met
a stuck-up bitch in your life?

34:36.741 --> 34:41.074
Really. I mean, she thinks she's so hot
just because she's from Beverly Hills.

34:41.245 --> 34:43.007
I don't think she's so hot.

34:43.181 --> 34:45.877
- You guys, you'll wake her up.
- Notice how she's not defending her?

34:46.050 --> 34:47.745
Well, maybe she'll come around.

34:47.918 --> 34:52.219
If not,
this is going to be a very long year.

35:08.639 --> 35:11.130
Hey, I got everything unpacked
in the kitchen.

35:11.309 --> 35:13.573
- Is there anything else?
- No, I think that's it. Thanks.

35:13.744 --> 35:16.975
I am so full. I can hardly walk.

35:17.148 --> 35:20.879
- Oh, my God, that's Donna's mom.
- What's she doing back here again?

35:21.052 --> 35:24.021
- I don't know. Hide in here.
- Why?

35:24.188 --> 35:27.624
It's 1 a. m.
If she sees you here, she'll freak.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.987
Hide, in the shower.

35:31.829 --> 35:34.093
Oh, you.

35:34.265 --> 35:36.130
You know, this is all backwards.

35:36.300 --> 35:39.167
It's the child who's supposed
to be leaving the nest, not me.

35:39.337 --> 35:41.498
You and Daddy
are gonna love Houston.

35:41.672 --> 35:44.937
And we'll be home on weekends.
Soon, I promise.

35:45.109 --> 35:46.838
- Are you gonna be all right?
- I'll be fine.

35:47.011 --> 35:48.444
Don't worry about a thing, okay?

35:49.514 --> 35:50.742
I love you.

35:51.115 --> 35:52.673
I love you too.

35:53.351 --> 35:55.546
- Hi, Mrs. Martin.
- Hi.

35:55.720 --> 35:59.212
- How was dinner?
- Oh, it was wonderful.

35:59.390 --> 36:02.291
Well, girls, the place looks great.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.621
You're gonna have
a terrific time here.

36:05.062 --> 36:06.154
Thanks.

36:08.699 --> 36:13.693
Well, I guess this is it, sweetie.

36:14.505 --> 36:16.871
Oh, Mom,
don't start crying again, okay?

36:17.041 --> 36:18.633
You'll see me
before you can even miss me.

36:18.809 --> 36:20.538
All right, you're right.
I'm just gonna leave

36:20.711 --> 36:22.235
- and get it over with.
- Right.

36:22.413 --> 36:24.779
But first I'm gonna make a stop
in the little girls' room.

36:24.949 --> 36:27.281
No. Yeah...

36:27.451 --> 36:31.945
- It's really... It's a mess.
- Well, I'll shut my eyes, I promise.

36:33.057 --> 36:34.319
David's in there.

36:34.492 --> 36:39.088
Oh, no, no. Mom, Mom, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, you can't go in there.

36:39.263 --> 36:42.960
- Donna, you're being so silly.
- It's just that...

36:43.501 --> 36:44.763
We don't have any toilet paper.

36:44.936 --> 36:47.029
Right. No toilet paper, tissues,
anything of the sort.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.673
Oh, well, in that case
I think I can wait.

36:49.840 --> 36:51.637
- One more hug.
- Okay.

36:52.510 --> 36:54.273
Bye, sweetheart.
I'll call you in the morning.

36:54.445 --> 36:58.677
Okay. Talk to you then.
Have a nice trip.

36:58.849 --> 37:01.340
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye-bye.

37:01.519 --> 37:04.886
- Oh, that was very close.
- I can't believe we pulled it off.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.388
Your parents are actually gone.

37:07.558 --> 37:10.220
Our first night alone together
in our new apartment.

37:10.394 --> 37:12.157
There's no turning back now.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.996
- I'm exhausted. I have to go to bed.
- Yeah.

37:17.168 --> 37:19.136
- Yeah, me too. I'm beat.
- Night all.

37:19.303 --> 37:20.930
Night.

37:28.713 --> 37:32.740
- What are you doing in here?
- Going to bed.

37:32.917 --> 37:35.511
No, not in here, you're not.

37:35.686 --> 37:37.813
Oh, come on, Donna.
You said we'd do it on prom night.

37:37.989 --> 37:40.014
And you've been putting me off
all summer.

37:40.191 --> 37:41.920
We live under the same roof,
for God's sakes.

37:42.093 --> 37:44.061
Isn't that, like, common-law marriage
or something?

37:44.228 --> 37:46.788
David, go to your room.

37:49.333 --> 37:52.461
What did I do in a previous life
to deserve this?

38:08.152 --> 38:11.315
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

38:12.490 --> 38:15.755
- How'd you sleep?
- So good.

38:16.227 --> 38:18.525
Better than I have in months.

38:19.830 --> 38:21.422
I can't tell you
how much it means to me

38:21.599 --> 38:24.033
to feel safe in a man's arms again.

38:24.302 --> 38:27.465
- Thank you.
- No need to thank me.

38:27.638 --> 38:29.833
I had a wonderful time.

38:30.274 --> 38:32.936
Almost as good as having sex.

38:33.344 --> 38:35.778
Yeah, I almost feel like we did.

38:42.086 --> 38:45.681
Are you sure you can't stay in L.A.
A little longer?

38:46.590 --> 38:50.253
No. I gotta get back
to those mean streets.

38:50.428 --> 38:53.761
Few more days of Malibu mellow
and I will definitely lose my edge.

38:55.099 --> 38:56.225
Never.

38:58.035 --> 39:00.936
- Have you ever been to New York?
- No.

39:01.839 --> 39:04.467
I think we're gonna have to do
something about that.

39:31.535 --> 39:32.934
I heard you were back.

39:33.104 --> 39:36.301
I'm back.
The culture shock hasn't worn off yet.

39:39.176 --> 39:40.734
So were you ever gonna call?

39:41.245 --> 39:42.940
Were you ever gonna give me
your number?

39:44.281 --> 39:46.044
Okay, we're even.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.114
On all counts.

39:52.223 --> 39:54.157
Dylan, I was such an idiot.

39:54.859 --> 39:58.056
I was selfish and jealous and mean

39:58.229 --> 39:59.890
and I know you're not
gonna believe this,

40:00.064 --> 40:01.588
but I never slept with that guy.

40:01.766 --> 40:05.327
I only let you think I did
to make you mad and...

40:15.980 --> 40:19.780
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you too.

40:19.950 --> 40:24.649
And for the record, Kel,
I didn't sleep with Brigitte either.

40:24.822 --> 40:26.722
I knew that.

40:45.276 --> 40:49.076
- Brenda, we had a deal.
- And I just broke it.

40:50.681 --> 40:52.774
What are you doing?

40:52.950 --> 40:54.747
Look, Darla, I'm getting out of here

40:54.919 --> 40:57.581
and then you can have the room
all to yourself.

40:57.755 --> 41:00.519
- See you late, Dar.
- Bye. Sorry.

41:00.691 --> 41:05.754
Listen, Brenda, we can hang out
in his dorm from now on.

41:05.930 --> 41:10.264
- No, this was just a terrible mistake.
- Please don't move out, Brenda.

41:10.434 --> 41:13.631
I know I've been a jerk lately,
but we've been friends forever.

41:14.638 --> 41:16.435
Darla, let's face it.

41:16.607 --> 41:18.541
Forever was a long time ago.

41:18.709 --> 41:21.007
And I heard what you and Katie
said about me last night.

41:21.712 --> 41:24.203
Oh, God, Brenda.

41:24.381 --> 41:26.246
I'm so sorry.

41:26.417 --> 41:30.046
Listen, I'll make it up to you,
I promise.

41:30.221 --> 41:33.987
Look, the truth is, it's not about you.
It's me.

41:34.525 --> 41:37.221
I came out here to prove
some kind of a point.

41:37.394 --> 41:39.828
To prove
that I could make it on my own.

41:39.997 --> 41:41.988
That I didn't need to be in L.A.
Where Brandon was

41:42.166 --> 41:43.929
or where all my friends were.

41:44.101 --> 41:46.296
I wanted to be different.

41:46.937 --> 41:49.633
Well, it turns out, I am different.

41:49.807 --> 41:53.573
Not just from my friends back home,
but from you and everyone else.

41:53.744 --> 41:55.507
And that's just the way it is.

42:03.454 --> 42:06.651
Okay, now, connect the cable
from the laser disc player output

42:06.824 --> 42:09.987
into the Auxiliary 2 input.

42:10.160 --> 42:12.219
David, there's a lot of holes in here.

42:12.396 --> 42:14.864
It's the one over on the right.
The one that says "auxiliary. "

42:15.032 --> 42:16.761
Okay, okay, I got it. I got it, okay.

42:16.934 --> 42:18.333
- Got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

42:18.502 --> 42:20.333
All right, now grab the pre-amp cable.

42:20.504 --> 42:22.904
Yeah, but wait, I don't understand
why we need all this.

42:23.073 --> 42:25.906
I mean, my system works just fine
and it's all in one piece.

42:26.076 --> 42:30.012
No, Donna, what you have
is not a system, it's a toy, okay?

42:30.180 --> 42:31.841
Now, when we get this baby
hooked up,

42:32.016 --> 42:33.074
you'll hear the difference.

42:33.250 --> 42:34.774
Do you think
that will be this century?

42:34.952 --> 42:37.079
I mean,
we only have a few years left.

42:37.254 --> 42:40.314
We're almost finished.
Got the cable in?

42:40.524 --> 42:44.085
- Yes, I got it.
- All right, here we go.

42:45.863 --> 42:48.127
Oh, we did it!

42:48.766 --> 42:52.167
- Hey, hello, anybody home?
- Oh, man.

42:52.336 --> 42:53.769
We thought you guys
would be hungry.

42:53.938 --> 42:58.432
- Wow, check out this pad, guys.
- No wonder you gave up the dorm.

42:58.609 --> 43:01.703
There. Well, it doesn't get much better
than this, huh?

43:02.379 --> 43:03.937
Is this a party or what?

43:05.015 --> 43:06.846
- Oh, well, it is now.
- What's happening?

43:07.017 --> 43:09.042
- Dylan.
- Hello, Donna.

43:09.219 --> 43:10.743
Hello.

43:10.921 --> 43:13.253
You guys want pepperoni
or mushroom?

43:13.424 --> 43:15.449
- Both.
- I like both.

43:15.626 --> 43:16.650
Yeah.

43:16.827 --> 43:18.590
Can I talk to you in the kitchen
for a second?

43:18.762 --> 43:20.389
- Thank you, sir.
- Nice catch, man.

43:24.468 --> 43:26.163
- Yo.
- What's wrong?

43:26.337 --> 43:28.737
Dylan and Kelly
are all over each other.

43:31.041 --> 43:32.065
So?

43:32.242 --> 43:34.802
So Brenda called me yesterday
and I told her they broke up.

43:34.979 --> 43:37.709
- Who cares?
- Well, Brenda might care.

43:37.881 --> 43:41.373
But it doesn't matter.
Brenda's halfway across the country.

43:41.552 --> 43:45.010
- Yeah, I guess you're right.
- Let's party.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
