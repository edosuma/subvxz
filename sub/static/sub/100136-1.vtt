<i>A lot of the time, you don't register</i>

00:22.600 --> 00:25.040
<i>the important moments in your life

00:25.840 --> 00:28.200
<i>You only see that they were important
when you look back.</i>

00:29.040 --> 00:30.600
Fuck seat belts.

00:32.840 --> 00:33.720
What should we do?

00:33.800 --> 00:36.400
We need to find somewhere nearby,
somewhere nice.

00:36.760 --> 00:37.760
Holy shit.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.920
Is breaking and entering
the best way of lying low?

00:40.000 --> 00:41.840
I think that's him,
the guy that lives here.

00:41.920 --> 00:43.720
We can just chill here, take our time.

00:44.280 --> 00:47.880
<i>Sometimes James feels like a boy

00:47.960 --> 00:50.760
<i>Being with Alyssa
had started to make me feel things.</i>

00:50.840 --> 00:52.840
- How did you get in here?
- Please don't.

00:58.640 --> 01:00.280
He was going to hurt you, Alyssa.

01:00.360 --> 01:01.560
Fucking drive!

01:01.640 --> 01:04.080
<i>I killed him. She didn't do anything.</i>

01:04.920 --> 01:07.080
- Move!
- Tell them that I did it all.

01:07.160 --> 01:08.080
Then you'll be okay.

01:08.160 --> 01:09.920
- Armed police!

It's Ray. From Saint Joseph's.

02:00.880 --> 02:02.360
We were in the same class.

02:02.920 --> 02:05.600
I had, like, a... medical eye patch
for a bit.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.360
Oh, yeah.

02:11.600 --> 02:12.600
And one of those.

02:18.440 --> 02:20.400
So how are you? You got kids?

02:20.800 --> 02:21.800
No.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.280
- Married?
- No.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.160
So what have you been doing?

02:25.920 --> 02:26.920
Prison.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Oh, right.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.160

02:33.920 --> 02:34.920
I killed someone.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.200
On purpose.

02:41.400 --> 02:42.400
Right.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.360
Shit.

02:51.920 --> 02:52.960
You properly got me there.

02:54.680 --> 02:55.520
You got me.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.920
- You always had a weird sense of humour.
- Yeah.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.920
I'm gonna go kill someone else now.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.480
- Do you want a bag?
- No, thanks.

08:41.640 --> 08:44.760
This is your textbook for the term.

08:54.640 --> 08:55.640
Don't move.

09:00.520 --> 09:01.600
Let's begin.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.520
Foucault is an embarrassment.

09:09.600 --> 09:10.800
He has no class.

09:14.160 --> 09:18.360
"Freedom is what you do
with what's been done to you."

09:18.440 --> 09:19.440
Sartre.

09:20.120 --> 09:22.560
Be the protagonist in your own story.

09:22.640 --> 09:26.920
And that story begins
with an act of intellectual defiance.

09:28.920 --> 09:31.920
Read Max Weber, Erving Goffman.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.320
Or if you want
a more contemporary perspective,

09:34.400 --> 09:35.560
this guy's pretty good.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.440
You're not a student, are you?

10:00.440 --> 10:01.720
You just work here.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.400
People have earned the right
to come to my class.

10:08.440 --> 10:09.440
You haven't.

10:11.560 --> 10:14.440
I don't want to see you again. Okay?

10:26.560 --> 10:28.760
<i>Sometimes people don't see your potential.</i>

10:32.840 --> 10:34.160
<i>So you have to show them.</i>

10:45.800 --> 10:46.800
Was this you?

10:48.520 --> 10:50.120
Is this human shit?

10:51.840 --> 10:52.840
Yeah.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.320
Yours?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Maybe.

11:05.640 --> 11:08.640
You can come to my class...
on one condition.

11:09.560 --> 11:10.560
What?

11:11.240 --> 11:12.520
You have a drink with me.

11:13.400 --> 11:14.440
Once a week.

11:17.040 --> 11:18.040
Okay.

11:31.880 --> 11:34.360
<i>Finally, I could see a future for myself.</i>

11:38.120 --> 11:39.160
<i>And it felt good.</i>

11:40.560 --> 11:44.040

12:35.120 --> 12:36.120
Do you like this?

12:37.640 --> 12:38.640
Not really.

12:45.280 --> 12:46.280
So...

12:47.720 --> 12:48.880
Tell me about yourself.

12:49.640 --> 12:50.640
No.

12:51.720 --> 12:52.720
Okay.

12:56.120 --> 12:57.880
Why did you want to take my class?

12:59.280 --> 13:00.320
I was interested.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.080
In what?

13:04.320 --> 13:05.520
In what the point is...

13:06.600 --> 13:07.800
of anything.

13:08.320 --> 13:09.880
Why aren't you a student?

13:11.520 --> 13:13.680
- You're clearly bright.
- Failed my exams.

13:16.720 --> 13:20.640
Exams rank different levels
of mediocrity, that's all.

13:21.280 --> 13:23.720
Exceptional people don't do well at them.

13:25.840 --> 13:26.840
I didn't.

13:32.720 --> 13:34.400
You are very pretty.

13:38.880 --> 13:39.880
Do you know that?

13:42.240 --> 13:43.440

13:47.920 --> 13:50.680
You're a little salmon, aren't you?

13:52.640 --> 13:53.640
What?

13:54.240 --> 13:56.560
You want to swim against the tide.

14:02.840 --> 14:04.400

14:22.400 --> 14:23.400
Take a taxi.

14:25.320 --> 14:26.320
Thank you.

14:30.240 --> 14:31.240
Do you know something?

14:32.080 --> 14:33.080

16:31.840 --> 16:33.280
Yeah, it's my favourite.

16:35.320 --> 16:36.320
Yeah.

16:38.160 --> 16:39.600

16:40.840 --> 16:42.520

16:51.240 --> 16:52.360
Okay.

16:53.400 --> 16:54.400

17:05.560 --> 17:06.560

17:08.840 --> 17:10.280

17:12.240 --> 17:14.000

17:14.760 --> 17:15.760
Are you gonna go?

17:17.600 --> 17:18.600
I like cheese.

17:24.280 --> 17:26.520
I'd like to take some photographs of you.

17:28.640 --> 17:29.680
What?

17:30.720 --> 17:32.400
Come and see me tomorrow night.

17:33.040 --> 17:34.360
How about tonight?

17:34.440 --> 17:35.880
I can't do tonight.

17:40.920 --> 17:42.440

<i>You can get impatient.</i>

18:37.240 --> 18:38.400
Who is she?

18:40.200 --> 18:43.000
- Oh, I didn't want to worry you.
- What?

18:44.640 --> 18:47.040
I'd only seen her in lectures.

18:47.120 --> 18:48.200
I didn't know her name

18:48.280 --> 18:50.280
until she came to see me
a couple of weeks ago.

18:52.120 --> 18:53.720
I was stupid.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.160
Agreeing to talk to her alone.

18:56.640 --> 18:58.920
She said she was worried about her exams.

18:59.440 --> 19:00.680
I believed her.

19:01.120 --> 19:02.600
She's clearly in love with me.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.440
And now she's made up these lies.

19:07.400 --> 19:08.480
She's threatening me.

19:09.040 --> 19:12.000
She's gonna say I attacked her.
She wants to destroy me.

19:12.080 --> 19:14.760
My life, my work. Everything.

19:14.840 --> 19:16.080
The girl's mad.

19:17.680 --> 19:19.120
So it isn't true?

19:20.040 --> 19:21.440
How can you ask me that?

19:21.520 --> 19:24.360
- No, look, I didn't...
- Get out.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.160
