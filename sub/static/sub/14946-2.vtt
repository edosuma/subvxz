12:33.795 --> 12:35.626
And now, they want
their pound of flesh.

12:35.714 --> 12:37.875
So you come to us
in exchange for what?

12:37.966 --> 12:39.342
I need immunity.

12:39.801 --> 12:42.668
Really?
Immunity in exchange
for information.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.882
Details regarding Liber8.

12:45.515 --> 12:46.641
Associates,

12:47.476 --> 12:48.807
hideouts, financials

12:48.894 --> 12:49.974
and intel.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.348
And how is it
you know these details?

12:53.357 --> 12:54.642
Immunity.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.105
Maybe.

12:59.655 --> 13:02.522
You need to give us
a taste before I agree
to anything.

13:06.203 --> 13:07.238
Hey.

13:08.372 --> 13:09.452
What's that?

13:09.539 --> 13:10.949
None of your business.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.448
Kiera, I'm on your side.

13:13.543 --> 13:14.623
Really?

13:15.087 --> 13:16.998
Because ljust
covered up your theft

13:17.089 --> 13:19.080
of the time travel slice
from other you.

13:19.174 --> 13:20.584
I'm not here
to clean up
your messes, Alec.

13:20.717 --> 13:23.094
I'm sorry.
It was an impulse move.

13:24.554 --> 13:26.260
How is other me
doing anyway?

13:27.557 --> 13:29.058
Desperately trying
to figure out

13:29.142 --> 13:32.134
who sabotaged
the network link
to my CMR.

13:32.229 --> 13:33.639
I'm assuming that was
your handiwork.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.106
Yeah, Ithought
we'd have some
awkward moments

13:35.190 --> 13:37.021
if he could hear and see
everything we're up to.

13:37.109 --> 13:38.315
Good point.

13:38.402 --> 13:40.108
Although, knowing you,
it won't take other you

13:40.195 --> 13:41.480
long to figure
things out.

13:44.866 --> 13:45.992
How's Emily?

13:47.077 --> 13:48.237
She's fine.

13:49.621 --> 13:50.997
Don't screw up her life

13:51.081 --> 13:53.413
now that you've gone to
all this trouble to save her.

13:54.084 --> 13:56.075
The best thing
that you can do
right now, Alec,

13:56.920 --> 13:58.751
is leave her alone.

14:03.093 --> 14:06.585
I think
whoever killed me was after
the time travel device.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.513
Dead me,
had just recovered
the pieces from Lucas.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.762
Can't you replay
the CCTV link from the lab?

14:13.937 --> 14:15.598
I deactivated it
when I arrived.

14:16.440 --> 14:17.475
VVhy?

14:17.566 --> 14:19.522
I couldn't risk him
seeing me.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.190
But I've been thinking.

14:21.278 --> 14:23.234
If her CMR link
was still active

14:23.321 --> 14:25.061
then there's a good chance
that your killer's image

14:25.157 --> 14:26.647
is still in the buffer
of my...

14:26.742 --> 14:28.073
Of his system.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.028
ljust need access
to the equipment.

14:30.954 --> 14:32.319
I can get you in.

14:32.789 --> 14:33.824
Is he there?

14:33.915 --> 14:34.904
Yeah.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.080
All right.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.408
What, you're just
gonna walk in?

14:39.087 --> 14:40.588
He doesn't know
I'm not me.

14:42.132 --> 14:45.465
Besides, he and I
have something
that you and I don't.

14:46.178 --> 14:47.418
What's that?

14:48.847 --> 14:50.007
Trust.

14:59.483 --> 15:00.814
(DOOR CLOSING)

15:03.945 --> 15:05.401
Any luck reconnecting us?

15:05.489 --> 15:06.729
On all fronts, no.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.906
Just one of many things
going on down here
I can't explain.

15:13.789 --> 15:15.120
Oh, good.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.041
You found it.
Yeah.

15:17.125 --> 15:18.581
Under some equipment.

15:19.503 --> 15:20.788
What's going on?

15:22.005 --> 15:23.290
Nothing.

15:24.174 --> 15:25.755
I recovered
the pieces from Lucas.

15:25.842 --> 15:27.127
I put them
on your desk.

15:30.222 --> 15:32.133
(SIGHING) Maybe
Jason found them

15:32.224 --> 15:34.135
and wanted to put them
someplace safe.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.015
And the blood?

15:36.478 --> 15:37.467
What blood?

15:38.105 --> 15:40.266
A few drops
where I found
those slices.

15:42.692 --> 15:43.943
I have no idea.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.109
What are you
not telling me, Kiera?

15:47.197 --> 15:48.403
Nothing.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.360
There is
nothing to tell.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.403
This is good news.

15:57.207 --> 15:59.744
I'm one step closer
to getting home, right?

16:03.421 --> 16:04.627
You hold onto it.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.552
You still have
the missing piece?

16:09.636 --> 16:11.547
Yeah, I'll get it to you.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.139
You know
Piron was working on

16:16.226 --> 16:17.762
a stable anti-matter
power source?

16:17.853 --> 16:19.468
And bought LaRoche Energy.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.266
But... (SIGHING)

16:22.357 --> 16:24.063
I'm kind of worried
that Escher's research

16:24.151 --> 16:25.766
might have died
along with him.

16:27.863 --> 16:29.069
Alec, about Escher...

16:30.031 --> 16:31.191
What about him?

16:32.409 --> 16:34.775
| just think that it...
(CELL PHONE CHIMING)

16:38.373 --> 16:40.238
Is everything okay?

16:41.835 --> 16:43.917
That DNA test
that I did on Jason...

16:45.547 --> 16:46.627
It's a match.

16:49.634 --> 16:51.010
He's my father.

16:57.225 --> 16:58.340
I got this one.

17:00.979 --> 17:03.311
Regular gang business
not interesting enough
for you, Marco?

17:05.317 --> 17:06.602
You just had to
hitch your wagon

17:06.693 --> 17:08.229
to a terrorist organization.

17:08.320 --> 17:10.857
This is bullshit.
We don't want anything
to do with Liber8.

17:10.947 --> 17:12.528
I never said
anything about Liber8.

17:14.868 --> 17:17.109
What, no snappy
comeback?

17:18.914 --> 17:20.495
Even wanna speculate
on who ratted you out?

17:21.124 --> 17:22.580
Well, let me guess.

17:22.667 --> 17:24.282
He just won the election

17:24.377 --> 17:25.787
and he wants to
clean up his mess.

17:26.379 --> 17:29.041
Things would go
a lot smoother for you
if you just cooperated.

17:30.091 --> 17:31.080
Come on, man.

17:31.176 --> 17:32.837
City Hall's
in the pocket of Liber8.

17:32.928 --> 17:35.920
You guys are in bed
with big business.

17:36.014 --> 17:37.254
Shit, I can't even tell you

17:37.349 --> 17:38.930
who the bad guys are anymore.

17:53.531 --> 17:54.816
Travis.

17:54.908 --> 17:55.897
I knew you'd get away.

17:56.952 --> 17:57.987
Ah.

18:01.081 --> 18:02.161
We gotta talk.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.489
We do.

18:05.252 --> 18:06.458
What's happening?

18:06.544 --> 18:07.670
Oh, just the first step

18:07.754 --> 18:09.915
in a whole
new battle strategy.

18:10.006 --> 18:11.257
Let's go.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.009
Hey, Jason.

18:21.851 --> 18:22.886
Dad.

18:23.687 --> 18:24.972
(CHUCKUNG)

18:27.816 --> 18:29.226
You know, I never got to
know my father.

18:32.821 --> 18:34.277
I have a feeling that
you and I share that.

18:37.117 --> 18:41.281
So, how's
the changing history
deal coming along?

18:41.371 --> 18:42.656
Actually,
that's why I'm here.

18:42.747 --> 18:43.736
In the other timeline,

18:43.832 --> 18:45.663
I came here with Emily
and the time travel device.

18:46.376 --> 18:48.412
It brought
all the Freelancers.

18:48.503 --> 18:49.913
There was some shooting.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.165
And she was killed.

18:52.716 --> 18:53.922
That's today.

18:54.009 --> 18:55.124
(WHISPERING) Oh, no.

18:55.218 --> 18:56.207
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

18:57.971 --> 18:59.336
You expecting someone?

19:05.603 --> 19:07.389
Hide, hide, hide,
hide, hide, hide.

19:12.068 --> 19:13.103
Hi.

19:14.279 --> 19:15.314
Hi.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.482
I'm sorry tojust
barge in like this.

19:20.577 --> 19:21.987
No, it's good,
it's fine.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.989
I just needed to
talk to you for a second.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.490
JASON: Oh, yeah, yeah.
I get it.

19:25.582 --> 19:27.163
It's one of
those days, huh?

19:27.917 --> 19:29.953
I, uh, I actually
brought this.

19:38.762 --> 19:41.469
That's, uh, dangerous.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.058
So, I ran some
DNA tests on you.

19:47.145 --> 19:48.385
Mmm-hmm.

19:49.773 --> 19:50.762
Where's Emily?

19:50.857 --> 19:52.188
She's on her way.

19:52.275 --> 19:53.981
JASON: Oh, no,
that's no good.

19:54.611 --> 19:56.272
That's no good.
Emily.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.853
I know you're my father.

19:59.157 --> 20:00.442
Hmm.

20:02.702 --> 20:03.691
Did you hear me?

20:04.037 --> 20:05.117
Hmm?

20:05.997 --> 20:07.578
Are you gonna
say anything?

20:07.665 --> 20:10.793
Uh, I'm not your father.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.037
No,you
don't understand.

20:12.128 --> 20:14.710
We're genetic matches,
father and son.

20:19.511 --> 20:20.796
Oh, shit.

20:22.806 --> 20:24.671
Of course.
Yeah.

20:25.683 --> 20:26.809
(JASON COUGHING)

20:27.769 --> 20:29.100
Uh, so then...

20:31.815 --> 20:33.100
So you're my son?

20:34.818 --> 20:36.024
Maybe.

20:37.153 --> 20:38.689
"Maybe"?

20:40.448 --> 20:41.563
Hey, I got
your message.

20:41.658 --> 20:42.818
Turn around.
What?

20:43.743 --> 20:45.028
Walk.
Okay. Whoa.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.109
What's happening?

20:46.204 --> 20:47.193
I'm saving your life.

20:47.288 --> 20:48.744
Really?
Really.

20:48.832 --> 20:51.039
Enough. You've been
acting weird
ever since yesterday.

20:51.126 --> 20:52.206
What's going on?

20:52.293 --> 20:53.544
I promise I'll explain

20:53.628 --> 20:55.289
everything to you
okay, one day.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.995
Just give me some time
to figure things out.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.876
Can you do that?
Yeah, I can do that.

20:58.967 --> 21:00.298
Whatever you want, Alec.

Okay, come on.

21:12.730 --> 21:13.856
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGING)

21:14.441 --> 21:16.227
Ah, your friend.

21:19.821 --> 21:21.402
I'll handle this one.

21:24.284 --> 21:25.524
What are you doing here?

21:25.618 --> 21:26.824
Being a good citizen.

21:26.911 --> 21:29.027
I, uh, happened to be
in the general vicinity

21:29.122 --> 21:31.738
when Mr. Escher met
his unfortunate end.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.494
Hmm.
Of course you were.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.370
You don't seem surprised
to see me alive.

21:39.382 --> 21:40.588
Should I be?

21:41.092 --> 21:42.468
What do you want?

21:42.552 --> 21:44.634
Just getting ahead
of the shitstorm.

21:44.721 --> 21:47.963
And you better make sure
I don't get forced

21:48.057 --> 21:50.469
into any legal situations
where I have to say anything

21:50.560 --> 21:53.518
about certain things,
certain time travelers.

21:55.690 --> 21:57.100
Who are they?

21:57.192 --> 21:58.648
I don't know.

21:58.735 --> 22:00.066
Time travelers.

22:00.153 --> 22:02.565
They're no friend
of the protector
or us.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.646
What makes you think
we don't have to worry
about them anymore?

22:04.741 --> 22:06.231
Something the
protector said to me

22:06.326 --> 22:07.691
right before
she sprung me.

22:08.786 --> 22:10.162
They have bigger
problems than us.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.365
So, the protector
got you out?

22:12.457 --> 22:13.617
Yeah.

22:22.926 --> 22:24.462
I'll give you two
a minute.

22:31.935 --> 22:33.300
You were right, Garza.

22:35.647 --> 22:37.808
Kagami was
more interested
in his own legacy

22:37.899 --> 22:39.764
than what was best
for Liber8.

22:41.653 --> 22:45.521
I believed him
because he was
my teacher,

22:45.615 --> 22:46.946
my mentor.

22:48.451 --> 22:50.863
IbeHeved
the path of resistance
could be shaped

22:50.954 --> 22:52.785
by a dead man's
final wishes,

22:52.872 --> 22:56.581
and I believe
differently now.

22:57.460 --> 22:58.870
Convenient.

23:00.380 --> 23:01.790
To ensure change,
we must strike

23:01.881 --> 23:02.870
at the heart
of the problem

23:02.966 --> 23:04.547
and strike hard.

23:06.344 --> 23:07.424
We need to rid ourselves

23:07.512 --> 23:11.721
of outsiders and reconnect
to the truth that united us
in the future.

23:14.143 --> 23:17.180
And how exactly
do we achieve that?

23:19.148 --> 23:21.685
Well, if the enemy
won't meet us

23:21.776 --> 23:23.357
on the battlefield,

23:23.444 --> 23:26.026
then we must bring
the battlefield to them.

23:33.288 --> 23:34.448
Give me a second.

23:35.498 --> 23:36.578
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

23:37.375 --> 23:40.242
Your pal here was caught
on the Gallery CCTV

23:40.336 --> 23:41.587
sitting with Escher,

23:41.671 --> 23:43.161
seconds before
he was killed.

23:44.841 --> 23:46.047
I might have left
that part out.

a statement, Detective.

23:48.678 --> 23:51.966
Yes, lwas meeting
Mr. Escher for a business
face-to-face.

23:52.599 --> 23:53.634
Nothing more.

to do here?

24:11.826 --> 24:12.815
Okay!

24:12.910 --> 24:14.866
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
(PANTING)

24:14.954 --> 24:16.285
What's up?
KIERA: Nothing good.

24:16.372 --> 24:18.158
I need you back
at your lab.

24:18.249 --> 24:19.329
It's not actually
my lab.

24:19.417 --> 24:21.624
I can'tjust waltz in there
whenever I want.

24:21.711 --> 24:23.247
That puts me at
a distinct disadvantage.

24:23.338 --> 24:24.874
Well, you were
stealthy enough

24:24.964 --> 24:27.671
to install the firewall
in my CMR uplink.

24:27.759 --> 24:30.000
I need you working on
solving my murder.

24:31.054 --> 24:33.796
Besides, you've always
been really good at

24:33.890 --> 24:35.050
looking out
for yourself, Alec.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.762
You are never gonna
let me live this down,
are you?

24:39.437 --> 24:40.597
Not in this timeline.

24:41.064 --> 24:42.725
I'll find a way
to get you into the lab.

24:44.859 --> 24:46.395
I need a ride.

24:46.486 --> 24:47.726
So calla cab.

24:49.364 --> 24:50.524
(CHUCKUNG)

24:51.199 --> 24:52.564
You're supposed
to be protecting me.

24:52.659 --> 24:53.899
Uh, no.

24:54.702 --> 24:57.114
You wanted protection,
which is why
you're camped out here.

24:57.205 --> 24:58.240
That's not the same thing.

24:59.415 --> 25:01.451
You wanna stay safe?
Stay put.

25:01.542 --> 25:03.874
The City Board of Trade
needs to speak to me
in person.

25:03.961 --> 25:05.576
You want the top
corporate CEOS

25:05.672 --> 25:06.661
in the city to come here?

25:06.756 --> 25:08.292
I really don't care.

25:08.383 --> 25:10.214
Either way,
I'm still down an office.

25:11.052 --> 25:12.041
Your Honor.

25:12.136 --> 25:13.296
Well, you should care.

25:13.388 --> 25:14.377
From what I understand,

25:14.472 --> 25:15.587
your relationship
to the Piron Corp

25:15.682 --> 25:16.717
is very important to you.

25:16.808 --> 25:19.094
Being a new
board member and all.

25:26.484 --> 25:27.815
What's that
supposed to mean?

25:27.902 --> 25:29.733
Well, it means
you can point fingers

25:29.821 --> 25:31.402
because my association
with Liber8

25:31.489 --> 25:32.945
has allowed me
to accomplish my goals,

25:33.658 --> 25:36.821
when you've done exactly
the same thing with Piron.

25:37.578 --> 25:39.443
You've compromised
because that's what happens

25:39.539 --> 25:40.779
ifyou wanna make
a difference.

25:41.499 --> 25:43.956
Or maybe
you don't like results.

25:45.461 --> 25:47.326
I am nothing like you.

25:49.549 --> 25:51.380
Keep telling
yourself that.

25:56.973 --> 25:58.884
I need an ambulance
at the stadium precinct.

26:01.352 --> 26:02.637
(KEYBOARD CLACKING)

26:09.110 --> 26:10.316
Oh, hi.

26:11.112 --> 26:12.648
What the hell
happened in there?

26:12.739 --> 26:13.899
I gave my statement.

26:13.990 --> 26:17.574
Like I said,
there's nothing connecting
me to Escher's killer.

26:17.660 --> 26:19.321
Well, directly.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.493
I know what you did.

26:21.581 --> 26:23.822
I do a lot of things.
You'll have to be
a little more specific.

26:25.793 --> 26:28.626
You killed him.
You killed Escher.

26:30.131 --> 26:32.463
Oh, come on,
don't pretend to be
all broken up about it.

26:38.347 --> 26:39.678
Okay, that was odd.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.677
Can we focus, Matthew?

26:41.768 --> 26:43.429
Oh, yeah, sorry.
Uh, where were we?

26:43.519 --> 26:44.508
Uh,oh,yeah!

26:44.604 --> 26:45.593
We were playing a game

26:45.688 --> 26:47.428
where you seem to think
you know what's going on,

26:47.523 --> 26:49.639
and that's supposed
to have some kind of
effect on me.

26:50.401 --> 26:51.607
Well, you can save
your breath

26:51.694 --> 26:53.935
because nothing
you have to say

26:54.030 --> 26:56.772
is gonna get you
whatever it is you want.

26:59.744 --> 27:02.736
Escher was Alec's father.

27:06.751 --> 27:07.866
Huh.

27:09.378 --> 27:11.084
That I did not see coming.

27:11.172 --> 27:12.412
Alec doesn't know yet

27:12.507 --> 27:13.997
and I don't wanna tell him.

27:14.091 --> 27:16.628
But I'm guessing
that your little
business arrangement

27:16.719 --> 27:18.926
is gonna get
just a bit difficult

27:19.013 --> 27:21.595
when Alec finds out
you murdered his dad.

27:21.682 --> 27:24.549
Yeah, I see your point.
What do you want?

27:24.644 --> 27:26.976
I want what's going
to happen anyway.

27:27.063 --> 27:28.098
Stay away from Alec.

27:31.108 --> 27:32.097
Um...

27:33.820 --> 27:34.809
Which one?

27:37.323 --> 27:38.438
There it is.

27:39.951 --> 27:41.862
You really wanna play
this game with me, Kiera?

27:43.037 --> 27:44.277
How did you find out?

27:44.372 --> 27:45.612
Well, you just told me.

27:48.417 --> 27:49.827
And I'm smart,
I did the math.

27:50.253 --> 27:51.493
What does that mean?

27:51.587 --> 27:53.703
Some things are obvious
when you pay attention.

27:53.798 --> 27:56.335
And, you know,
time travel's involved.

28:00.555 --> 28:03.137
Can we just hit
the lights and get
around this mess?

28:03.224 --> 28:04.384
I'm gonna be late.

28:04.475 --> 28:05.715
We can't do that, sir.

(SIRENS WAILING)
16 en route. We're right
around the corner.

28:13.568 --> 28:15.024
Seriously?

28:15.111 --> 28:16.567
Guys, I don't have
time for this!

28:16.654 --> 28:18.190
Sir, I'm gonna
to have to ask you
to settle down.

28:18.281 --> 28:19.737
We've received
a 911 call

28:19.824 --> 28:21.439
and we're the closest
support unit.

28:21.534 --> 28:24.025
I am ordering you
to ignore that call.

28:37.466 --> 28:39.002
How long
is this gonna take?

28:41.804 --> 28:43.305
Oh, not long at all.

28:53.441 --> 28:55.056
Congratulations
on your win.

28:55.818 --> 28:57.649
Now, we're all
very proud of you.

28:58.112 --> 28:59.568
What do you want?

28:59.655 --> 29:02.146
Well, your campaign
promised accountability.

29:02.241 --> 29:05.028
We just wanna make sure
that you keep that promise
to the voters.

29:07.496 --> 29:09.703
We've prepared a list
of your demands.

29:12.460 --> 29:13.700
My demands?

29:13.794 --> 29:15.000
Our demands.

29:15.504 --> 29:17.631
SONYA: Ithought
we all wanted
the same thing, Jim.

29:18.507 --> 29:19.758
You to live.

29:24.055 --> 29:25.261
TRAVIS: GO.

29:27.308 --> 29:29.799
Corporate interests
in this city

29:29.894 --> 29:33.136
have absorbed
and perverted
democracy at its heart.

29:33.689 --> 29:35.896
Voters elected me
to put an end
to this corruption.

29:36.609 --> 29:38.019
It stretches
from the boardroom

29:38.527 --> 29:39.937
to the police department.

29:40.029 --> 29:41.769
The pillars
of legitimate business

29:41.864 --> 29:45.948
are merely fronts
for large-scale thievery
and extortion.

29:46.035 --> 29:47.866
Do you have any idea
how stupid we look?

29:49.372 --> 29:50.452
Is this coming
through live?

29:50.539 --> 29:52.530
It's on Liber8's website
so anyone can pick it up.

29:53.084 --> 29:54.164
Uh, Alec's here.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.537
Oh, hey.
Hey.

30:04.345 --> 30:05.380
What's With the kid?

30:05.471 --> 30:06.927
Inspector Dillon,
meet Alec Sadler,

30:07.014 --> 30:08.720
my personal
tech genius.

30:08.808 --> 30:10.048
I asked him
to come in.

30:10.393 --> 30:11.508
Hi. Nice to meet you.

30:12.103 --> 30:13.388
(CLEARING THROAT)

30:14.188 --> 30:15.769
I think he can help us
locate the mayor.

30:15.856 --> 30:16.982
And how is he
gonna do that?

30:17.066 --> 30:18.101
I can hear you,
you know.

30:18.192 --> 30:19.523
Then answer the question.

30:20.236 --> 30:22.352
I don't even know
what we're
talking about.

30:26.826 --> 30:28.487
Show him
what you can do.

30:30.830 --> 30:31.945
You there?

30:32.039 --> 30:33.279
Mmm-hmm.

30:33.874 --> 30:36.001
SCAR ALEC: Right.
You can’t talk to me
in front of the other me.

30:36.711 --> 30:38.247
Nice work getting
the other Alec
out of here.

30:40.423 --> 30:41.833
I'm accessing your CMR.

30:41.924 --> 30:44.131
Hopefully I'll be able
to see who killed you.

30:45.678 --> 30:47.043
We might have
a problem here.

30:47.138 --> 30:48.969
Looks like some serious
video interference.

30:50.266 --> 30:52.052
Holy shit!
There's two signals.

30:54.562 --> 30:55.551
You okay?

30:55.646 --> 30:56.931
That DNA thing.

30:57.773 --> 30:59.309
Turns out
I got it backwards.

31:00.443 --> 31:01.853
Whatever it is,
I'm here
for you Alec.

31:03.946 --> 31:04.935
Thanks.

31:05.448 --> 31:06.688
So, listen I think
Ifigured out a way

31:06.782 --> 31:08.318
to find out who killed
the other you.

31:08.409 --> 31:09.990
Looks like both Kieras
were sending video

31:10.077 --> 31:11.487
at the time
the other you
was killed.

31:11.579 --> 31:12.534
Talk to you
for a second?

31:12.621 --> 31:14.157
It may take some time,
but I might be able

31:14.248 --> 31:16.534
to unscramble
the corrupted video.

31:16.625 --> 31:17.956
Get a good look
at your murderer.

31:18.711 --> 31:21.123
Is this is your Alec
or is this our Alec?

31:21.839 --> 31:22.954
What are you getting at?

31:23.716 --> 31:24.922
You know as much
as I've come to terms

31:25.009 --> 31:28.297
with the whole
time travel super suits

31:28.387 --> 31:29.968
multiple everybodies,

31:31.140 --> 31:32.630
I need to know
who I'm dealing with.

31:33.142 --> 31:34.973
Is this the Alec
that we can trust?

31:35.603 --> 31:36.683
Really, Carlos?

31:36.771 --> 31:38.887
All I know
is that this Alec

31:39.565 --> 31:40.600
has never given me

31:40.691 --> 31:41.726
any reason to believe

31:41.817 --> 31:43.273
that he wouldn't
come through for us.

31:43.861 --> 31:45.271
(SIGHING)
We're all
making this up

31:45.362 --> 31:46.738
as we go along, Carlos.

31:46.822 --> 31:47.857
None of us are immune

31:47.948 --> 31:50.610
from making bad decisions.

31:51.452 --> 31:53.158
No matter
what timeline we're from.

31:53.621 --> 31:54.827
(SCOFFS)

31:54.914 --> 31:56.154
There's some
background stuff here

31:56.248 --> 31:57.909
I might be able
to key into.

31:59.001 --> 32:01.868
Might be able to
narrow down a location
using triangulation.

32:02.838 --> 32:04.169
Well, the kid knows
his stuff.

32:04.548 --> 32:05.879
Great. What you got?

32:05.966 --> 32:07.581
Well, the video
is completely masked.

32:07.676 --> 32:09.212
It's bouncing off
a zillion servers

32:09.303 --> 32:11.339
so I can't possibly
track the origin,

32:11.430 --> 32:12.590
but there's some
background noise

32:12.681 --> 32:13.670
and some
video interference

32:13.766 --> 32:16.348
that may be specific
to electromagnetic
radiation in the area.

32:16.852 --> 32:18.137
Gotta admire
his tenacity.

32:18.229 --> 32:19.264
Enough.

32:19.563 --> 32:21.178
"Enough" what?
What?

32:22.024 --> 32:22.979
Found him.

32:23.067 --> 32:24.898
Found the mayor.
Really?

32:24.985 --> 32:26.270
Oh, no way.

32:26.362 --> 32:29.399
Yeah, the live signal
was being spoofed
big-time.

32:29.490 --> 32:30.605
But I had a worm running

32:30.699 --> 32:33.190
from months ago
from when Lucas planted
a virus on our system.

32:33.786 --> 32:35.822
It was just buried
in the digital signature.

32:35.913 --> 32:36.948
l activated it

32:37.039 --> 32:38.620
and traced it back.

32:38.999 --> 32:39.988
Lucky break.

32:40.084 --> 32:41.290
Totally.

32:41.377 --> 32:42.457
Do you have an address?

32:42.545 --> 32:43.625
Yeah, I'll text it to you.

32:43.712 --> 32:44.963
All right, great.

32:45.047 --> 32:46.253
Good work, Betty.

32:46.882 --> 32:48.292
Thank you.
Thanks.

32:54.014 --> 32:55.550
KIERA: This is it.

32:56.267 --> 32:58.132
CARLOS: (SIGHING)
Abandoned warehouse.

32:58.227 --> 33:00.559
Of course, it's always
an abandoned warehouse.

33:26.088 --> 33:27.453
Oh, Jim.

33:28.716 --> 33:32.049
One of you should
probablyjust
shoot me now. (SIGHING)

33:51.739 --> 33:52.819
You still there?

33:52.907 --> 33:53.862
Yep.

33:53.949 --> 33:55.280
The other you
is headed back to the lab

33:55.367 --> 33:56.868
so you might wanna
get yourself out of there.

33:56.952 --> 33:58.908
All right, I'll reset
the network ASAP.

33:58.996 --> 34:01.829
I can keep working
on the CMR playback
of your murder remotely.

34:02.958 --> 34:05.335
Don't worry, Kiera,
we'll find your killer,
I promise.

34:07.254 --> 34:08.630
Thank you, Alec.

34:09.340 --> 34:11.046
We'll get you out
on bail tonight,

34:11.133 --> 34:13.215
but with your priors,
you're looking at
some prison time.

34:13.636 --> 34:15.376
I can do the stint
just fine.

34:17.973 --> 34:19.224
Do me a favor.

34:19.308 --> 34:20.718
Anything within reason.

34:20.809 --> 34:22.891
Put me in the same
cellblock as this guy.

34:22.978 --> 34:24.354
Hey, Jim.
You're a dead man!

34:24.438 --> 34:25.553
Hey! Calm down!
You understand me?

34:25.648 --> 34:27.388
A dead man!
Where you gonna go?

34:27.483 --> 34:28.472
CARLOS: Sit your ass down.

34:28.567 --> 34:29.682
I'll get to you
as soon as I can.

34:29.777 --> 34:31.358
In the meantime,
keep your mouth shut.

34:31.445 --> 34:32.434
(CHUCKUNG)

34:32.529 --> 34:33.814
It's a way too late
for that, Counselor.

34:35.574 --> 34:36.689
But all this

34:37.076 --> 34:38.737
penny-ante corruption

34:39.328 --> 34:42.240
pales in comparison
to the promises
that l was made

34:42.331 --> 34:43.662
by corporations

34:43.749 --> 34:48.914
such as Vickerdale,
Sunmanto, Vermitas
and even Piron

34:49.004 --> 34:50.619
who all wanted me to...

34:53.008 --> 34:54.669
(SIGHING)
So what do we do?

34:55.469 --> 34:56.675
Nothing.

34:57.263 --> 34:58.423
Nothing?

34:58.514 --> 34:59.594
No charges?

35:01.141 --> 35:03.928
Nobody wants
to put this guy
on the witness stand.

35:04.019 --> 35:05.634
Too much to lose.

35:05.729 --> 35:07.890
Hell, even Liber8
looked like heroes

35:07.982 --> 35:09.688
for kidnapping
this scumbag.

35:10.734 --> 35:12.065
Nah, he's done.

35:13.153 --> 35:15.405
He just committed
political suicide.

35:16.532 --> 35:17.612
If he's smart,

35:17.700 --> 35:19.816
he1lnever
show his face
in this city again.

35:23.372 --> 35:25.158
Liber8 played
this one well.

35:29.044 --> 35:30.580
Hearts and minds.

35:35.467 --> 35:36.673
I thought
we were done.

35:36.760 --> 35:38.421
You know, I've always
had a soft spot

35:38.512 --> 35:39.718
for wayward redheads.

35:39.805 --> 35:41.796
Orphan Annie.
Anne of Green Gables.

35:41.890 --> 35:43.755
I don't have
all day, Kellog.

35:43.851 --> 35:45.011
Well, now that
Daddy Warbucks

35:45.102 --> 35:46.467
is out of the way,

35:46.562 --> 35:49.224
I'm betting
you're looking
for a new sponsor.

35:49.398 --> 35:50.387
(SCOFFS)

35:50.816 --> 35:52.317
I'm finally free
of Escher's grip

35:52.401 --> 35:53.766
and now you want me
to work for you.

35:55.321 --> 35:56.401
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:57.656 --> 35:59.647
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

36:01.910 --> 36:04.697
Look, I... I really think
this is a win-win for you.

36:04.788 --> 36:06.995
You get to stay
close to loverboy

36:07.082 --> 36:09.994
and I keep your lies,
real name

36:10.085 --> 36:12.667
and impressive rap sheet
out of circulation.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.541
Fine. Bluff called.

36:15.632 --> 36:17.338
You wanna tell him?
Go for it.

36:17.426 --> 36:19.337
I think I know Alec
well enough.
He'll get over it.

36:19.428 --> 36:20.508
See ya.

36:23.223 --> 36:24.508
I'll raise you.

36:24.600 --> 36:25.806
Then raise me!

36:25.893 --> 36:27.099
Escheh

36:31.648 --> 36:32.728
Bullshit.

36:32.816 --> 36:34.977
You connect me to that,
we both go down!

36:35.903 --> 36:37.359
Besides, we both
wanted him dead.

36:37.446 --> 36:38.561
What you need to realize

36:38.655 --> 36:40.441
is never mess with a girl
who shows a propensity

36:40.532 --> 36:41.988
for deadly force.

36:42.076 --> 36:43.737
That's true,
but that's not what
lwas thinking.

36:43.827 --> 36:45.738
lwas thinking
how you know Alec
well enough

36:45.829 --> 36:49.663
to know that
he would not get over

36:50.584 --> 36:52.370
you killing his father.

36:56.715 --> 36:57.955
Escher was...

37:00.260 --> 37:01.340
Hmm.

37:02.012 --> 37:03.968
ljust found out myself.

37:09.853 --> 37:10.842
It's good to be
in business

37:10.938 --> 37:12.098
with you, Red.

37:13.357 --> 37:14.472
(SOBBING)

37:26.245 --> 37:27.701
(LAUGHING) Wow.

37:28.664 --> 37:30.700
I didn't know
you were in the market.

37:30.791 --> 37:31.951
Neither did I.

37:32.918 --> 37:34.624
I was
in the neighborhood.

37:34.711 --> 37:35.791
I saw the
"For Lease" Sign

37:35.879 --> 37:37.585
and I recognized
it immediately.

37:38.507 --> 37:40.372
This is the home
I grew up in.

37:41.343 --> 37:43.880
My parents,
my grandparents.

37:45.264 --> 37:47.220
We all lived right here.

37:53.021 --> 37:55.433
I learned some
pretty hard lessons
in this place.

37:56.525 --> 37:57.605
SAMANTHA: What are
you doing?

37:57.693 --> 37:59.524
PUBLIC SERVANT:
Calling CPS.

38:00.863 --> 38:04.321
Yeah, I see, uh,
multiple prohibited items.

38:04.408 --> 38:07.275
We're gonna need
a forensic cataloging
team in here.

38:07.369 --> 38:08.779
Search the
entire premises.

38:08.871 --> 38:10.236
How much is that
gonna cost me?

38:10.330 --> 38:11.319
Believe me, ma'am,

38:11.415 --> 38:13.531
the cost is the least
of your worries now.

38:14.376 --> 38:15.707
Unregistered media,

38:16.336 --> 38:18.042
analog or
printed materials,

38:18.672 --> 38:21.630
physical video
or audio media

38:23.385 --> 38:24.670
is classified contraband

38:24.761 --> 38:27.047
and subject to seizure
under Section 702

38:27.139 --> 38:30.097
ofthe
Domestic Intelligence
Surveillance Act.

38:31.101 --> 38:32.682
It must be
surrendered immediately.

38:34.062 --> 38:35.518
That's what
the law says.

38:36.523 --> 38:37.899
You have it memorized.

38:39.067 --> 38:41.228
I was bringing
that box to you.

38:41.695 --> 38:43.481
I don't want this
on my record.

38:44.072 --> 38:45.403
I plan to join
the military.

38:45.491 --> 38:47.152
Fight against
the subversives.

38:47.910 --> 38:49.116
Really?

38:53.290 --> 38:57.249
I have a public service
recruitment pass.

38:57.336 --> 38:58.667
It's, um...

38:59.671 --> 39:00.922
It's worth
1000 life credits

39:01.006 --> 39:02.837
to me, ifyou use it.

39:03.717 --> 39:06.129
I can transmit it to you
via citizen chip.

39:06.970 --> 39:08.506
No CPS search?

39:08.597 --> 39:09.757
No.

39:10.766 --> 39:11.846
And...

39:12.559 --> 39:13.674
I'll knock 10,000 off

39:13.769 --> 39:15.350
your mother's Life Debt.
It won't zero it out,

39:15.437 --> 39:16.973
but it'll come close.

39:31.870 --> 39:32.950
Okay.

39:34.289 --> 39:36.120
I'll come back
for the rest of this later.

39:38.168 --> 39:39.408
You know, ma'am,
you could learn
a thing or two

39:39.503 --> 39:40.993
from your daughter.

39:44.424 --> 39:46.039
You don't think, Kiera.

39:46.134 --> 39:47.635
That was a commitment
you just made.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.095
They'll expect you
to honor it.

39:50.389 --> 39:51.629
I intend to.

39:52.849 --> 39:54.464
I can't believe you.

39:55.769 --> 39:56.758
Tell me

39:57.104 --> 39:59.015
you did that to get me
out of trouble.

40:02.484 --> 40:03.519
I didn't.

40:05.487 --> 40:07.569
IbeHeve
in this war, Mom.

40:09.116 --> 40:10.981
I wanna make a difference.

40:14.830 --> 40:18.163
I'm gonna try
to calm Hannah down.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.180
Prove to me that I can
trust you, Alec.

40:44.526 --> 40:45.857
Prove to me

40:46.194 --> 40:48.355
that you're the one
that can send me
back to my time.

40:49.072 --> 40:50.812
I'm done with time travel.

40:52.868 --> 40:55.450
I'm out
of the family business
from this moment.

41:00.083 --> 41:02.335
ljust wanna make sure
Emily's happy.

41:02.419 --> 41:04.284
That's all that
matters to me.

41:05.255 --> 41:06.961
The longer I'm involved
with all of this,

41:07.049 --> 41:09.506
just the worse
it's gonna get
for you and me.

41:09.593 --> 41:10.708
The other me, that is.

41:11.845 --> 41:14.712
The important thing
is that you love her.

41:15.974 --> 41:17.054
She loves you.

41:18.894 --> 41:20.600
As long as you don't tell
the other me the truth

41:20.687 --> 41:22.552
then everything
will work itself out.

41:24.066 --> 41:25.226
What about me
getting back

41:25.317 --> 41:26.807
to my family?

41:26.902 --> 41:28.858
Is that just gonna
sort itself out?

41:30.197 --> 41:31.312
I don't know.

41:32.658 --> 41:34.740
All I know is that
if there is a way
backforyou

41:34.826 --> 41:37.568
then I'm not the guy
to help you find it.

41:39.831 --> 41:41.082
Who is?

41:43.585 --> 41:45.086
You know who.

41:52.552 --> 41:53.758
Hey.
Hi.

41:55.472 --> 41:56.928
Want some help?

41:58.183 --> 41:59.923
Actually, Ithink
I need to be alone tonight.

42:00.686 --> 42:01.846
Start tomorrow?

42:01.937 --> 42:03.177
Okay.

42:53.321 --> 42:54.606
(GUNSHOT)
