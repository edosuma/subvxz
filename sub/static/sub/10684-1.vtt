SWING VOTE

01:04.519 --> 01:07.876
<i>After a hotly contested race,</i>
<i>Americans go to the polls today...</i>

01:07.890 --> 01:10.757
<i>in what promises to be</i>
<i>a very close election.</i>

01:10.860 --> 01:14.682
<i>The Republican Andrew Boone,</i>
<i>hoping to hold on to the Oval Office...</i>

01:14.697 --> 01:17.018
<i>by edging out...</i>

01:17.033 --> 01:19.331
<i>the Democratic challenger</i>
<i>Donald Greenleaf.</i>

01:40.590 --> 01:43.007
Bud...
Bud.

01:44.360 --> 01:45.019
Bud!

01:49.065 --> 01:50.507
I'll call...
I'll call him back.

01:51.233 --> 01:54.100
If we had a phone, you could.
Come on!

01:56.806 --> 01:59.400
Goddamnit! It's cold.

01:59.475 --> 02:02.376
We're gonna be late again.
You need a shower.

02:03.346 --> 02:05.371
Can't believe
you slept in your clothes!

02:16.859 --> 02:18.349
Leave me any hot water?

02:19.295 --> 02:21.889
I don't know.
Water heater fix itself?

02:23.833 --> 02:27.257
Christ, Molly! Why don't you
just take the day off, okay?

02:27.269 --> 02:28.930
I'll write you a note.

02:31.540 --> 02:33.974
Now!
I'm not going to tell you again!

02:35.144 --> 02:35.940
Get up!

02:45.655 --> 02:46.349
<i>Bud!</i>

02:47.189 --> 02:48.884
Alright, I'm coming!

03:23.993 --> 03:26.518
- What?
- Egg salad.

03:27.563 --> 03:28.257
Again?

03:29.065 --> 03:30.430
You like egg salad.

03:30.499 --> 03:35.027
Well, not every damn day I don't.
You could mix it up a little.

03:35.271 --> 03:36.329
We're on a budget.

03:36.739 --> 03:39.207
You wanna eat better?
Drink less beer.

03:41.844 --> 03:43.573
- Fine.
- Fine.

03:45.081 --> 03:48.881
- And don't forget today.
- What's... what's today?

03:49.452 --> 03:50.783
Election day, dummy!

03:51.053 --> 03:54.045
I'm supposed to do a report
on you voting, remember?

03:54.123 --> 03:56.921
I already told you before
I'm not even registered.

03:57.193 --> 03:59.377
I registered for you
in the mail.

03:59.395 --> 04:02.364
That's great,
I could get jury duty now.

04:02.565 --> 04:05.796
- It's your civic responsibility.
- It's my civic, my what?

04:05.968 --> 04:07.663
It's your civic responsibility.

04:07.670 --> 04:10.332
My civic responsibility?
Where you learning this crap?

04:11.607 --> 04:12.904
Mrs. Abernathy.

04:13.075 --> 04:15.270
Well, stay away from her.

04:16.846 --> 04:18.040
She's my teacher.

04:43.806 --> 04:44.602
Sign this.

04:47.610 --> 04:48.269
What is it?

04:48.878 --> 04:52.041
A questionnaire. I'm supposed
to ask you about your politics.

04:52.948 --> 04:55.143
Well, go ahead.

04:55.251 --> 04:56.309
I already filled it in.

04:57.720 --> 04:59.051
I wanted you to sound smart.

05:01.991 --> 05:03.424
Give me
the first question anyway.

05:07.163 --> 05:08.824
What's your political affiliation?

05:11.567 --> 05:15.059
Alright,
I'm a conscious objector.

05:15.571 --> 05:19.860
It's not a war, Bud. It's an election.
And you are an independent.

05:19.875 --> 05:23.402
Independent? Why in the hell
would I be an independent?

05:23.946 --> 05:25.368
Because the two party system...

05:25.381 --> 05:28.407
has neglected the needs
of the working poor.

05:28.818 --> 05:30.308
- Let me tell you something, baby...
- Here we go again.

05:32.888 --> 05:35.880
The voting doesn't count
for a goddamn thing.

05:36.158 --> 05:38.888
Just a way to make you feel
like you're in control of something.

05:39.461 --> 05:43.522
It doesn't matter who you vote for,
we can't afford insurance and...

05:43.532 --> 05:47.593
if you get sick, I'm gonna have
to start selling my blood again.

05:47.736 --> 05:51.558
Mrs. Abernathy said every vote counts.
It's a social contract.

05:51.574 --> 05:56.204
It's a social contract.
This Mrs. Abernathy is full of shit.

06:16.031 --> 06:17.931
Meet me at the polling place
after work.

06:18.634 --> 06:19.293
Fine.

06:24.506 --> 06:25.700
You forgetting something?

06:29.311 --> 06:32.712
Bud, screw this up
and I'm leaving you.

06:38.554 --> 06:39.384
Do good!

07:09.518 --> 07:10.075
Where...

07:12.488 --> 07:13.614
Where the hell is Dewey?

07:14.723 --> 07:15.883
He got laid off.

07:15.958 --> 07:18.449
Bullshit! He got insourced.

07:19.395 --> 07:20.362
Insourced?

07:20.562 --> 07:24.362
Insourced. Instead of exporting
our jobs to Mexico...

07:24.500 --> 07:27.128
they're importing Mexicans
to take our jobs.

07:27.636 --> 07:29.194
You're paranoid,
you know that?

07:30.005 --> 07:34.169
<i>Attention! The opening</i>
<i>this morning is officially cancelled.</i>

07:37.646 --> 07:40.046
I can't even read
the damn signs no more!

07:41.350 --> 07:43.944
Our days are numbered, fellas.
You mark my words!

07:44.353 --> 07:46.617
These hombres work twice
as hard for half the money.

07:46.889 --> 07:50.017
I just figure they need this job
twice as bad as us!

07:50.926 --> 07:53.087
Whose side are you on?

07:53.329 --> 07:57.322
I don't take sides, Lowell.
Just stating the obvious.

07:59.268 --> 08:01.702
Next thing, they'll be taking
away our right to vote.

08:02.738 --> 08:03.636
You voting, Bud?

08:04.273 --> 08:06.366
It's a social contract,
isn't it?

08:07.543 --> 08:09.101
Who are you voting for?

08:11.046 --> 08:12.445
Shit if I know!

08:16.218 --> 08:21.383
I think I picked up a couple shades.
Looks like an eight.

08:21.623 --> 08:22.647
What do you think, Marty?

08:24.093 --> 08:25.890
I don't like
the margin in Florida.

08:26.061 --> 08:29.724
Bus some young Republicans down
to the polling stations in Palm Beach.

08:29.965 --> 08:34.368
Make sure they're tall,
they're blonde and they're men.

08:35.270 --> 08:39.604
Because old Jews see a pack
of angry young white males...

08:39.741 --> 08:42.438
and they're gonna think twice
about getting out of their car!

08:43.679 --> 08:47.672
Kennedy was a nine.
And he put a man on the moon.

08:50.419 --> 08:53.604
That's what we need.
Something to shoot for.

08:53.622 --> 08:56.921
A defining moment.
Like... I don't know.

09:00.095 --> 09:01.221
Cure for cancer.

09:05.267 --> 09:08.020
Ohio run the gay marriage
ad every twenty minutes.

09:08.037 --> 09:10.426
Let's see if we can't get those God
fearing bastards off the fence.

09:10.439 --> 09:12.999
We take a bunch of scientists,
put them in the desert somewhere.

09:13.375 --> 09:16.594
Like the Manhattan project. Are you
listening to me? I'm serious about this.

09:16.612 --> 09:19.399
I think that cancer is going to be
a tough nut to crack in one term, sir.

09:19.415 --> 09:20.780
So, we make it a ten year plan.

09:21.083 --> 09:23.381
- Lincoln got to see the end of slavery?
- No.

09:23.852 --> 09:25.843
- Did Kennedy get to see the moon shot?
- Nope.

09:26.021 --> 09:30.117
No! But they got the credit!
It's the idea that counts.

09:30.259 --> 09:33.319
The guy that sets the goal
gets in the history books!

09:33.796 --> 09:37.687
Hope and positivity! Marty,
the American people want a bright...

09:37.699 --> 09:41.157
shining smile to represent
the promise of this country.

09:41.770 --> 09:43.101
Take old Georgie there.

09:45.074 --> 09:48.635
Boy, he was off the charts.

09:50.012 --> 09:51.309
They wanted to make him King.

09:52.815 --> 09:53.747
Son of a gun!

10:07.863 --> 10:10.161
Thank you,
thank you for coming.

10:11.733 --> 10:16.033
Galena and I would like
to thank America...

10:16.438 --> 10:18.633
for this glorious opportunity.

10:18.774 --> 10:22.733
I have met people of every race,
color and creed...

10:22.811 --> 10:24.608
during this long campaign.

10:24.780 --> 10:28.773
I pledge to you that my White House
will be a rainbow house.

10:28.851 --> 10:31.979
It'll be open to people
of all colors and creeds.

10:32.488 --> 10:35.855
Now, please, go and vote.
We need your support.

10:42.498 --> 10:44.056
That was great.
I'm gonna go do press.

10:44.199 --> 10:44.688
Great.

10:49.204 --> 10:53.436
Greenleaf! Greenleaf!

10:54.510 --> 10:56.205
Gallup has you down by a point.

10:56.278 --> 11:00.374
CNN, USA Today, has us up by two.
News has us down by sixty.

11:00.449 --> 11:02.747
What message are you trying
to get out to the undecideds today?

11:02.818 --> 11:06.140
The same message we put out yesterday,
last week and last year...

11:06.155 --> 11:08.715
when we started this campaign
and that's why we're going to win.

11:08.957 --> 11:12.518
Because we have the answers.
Not platitudes and jingoistic rhetoric.

11:12.694 --> 11:15.254
This is the truth
train operation real deal.

11:15.364 --> 11:18.925
In recent days, the president
has aired ads claiming Greenleaf...

11:18.934 --> 11:20.822
has vacationed
at a nudist colony.

11:20.836 --> 11:23.532
Come on, now, that's a tired
accusation. It's pure fiction.

11:23.705 --> 11:27.300
- Then, how do you answer for the photos?
- Right wing blogo-smear, that's how.

11:27.309 --> 11:31.234
I could stand here and perpetuate
the rumor that as a young man...

11:31.246 --> 11:34.841
the president had a gambling addiction,
but I'm got going to sink to their level.

11:35.284 --> 11:38.276
Despite eye witness
accounts and documentation.

11:38.287 --> 11:39.948
They sling mud,
we sling ideas.

11:40.022 --> 11:43.924
Still, if Greenleaf loses,
you'll be 0 for 7 on the national scene.

11:45.561 --> 11:48.997
Thank you, Betty. Sorry, folks,
that's all I have time for.

11:49.631 --> 11:50.598
Leeches!

11:52.501 --> 11:54.628
Why it's important to vote.

11:54.703 --> 11:57.467
Many brave soldiers
sacrificed themselves.

11:57.639 --> 11:59.402
A right we take for granted.

12:00.008 --> 12:01.999
- For the people.
- By the people.

12:02.311 --> 12:04.176
We the people!

12:05.214 --> 12:06.704
I can't read my writing.

12:07.416 --> 12:10.579
All the world's great civilizations
have followed the same path.

12:10.953 --> 12:14.548
From bondage, to liberty,
from liberty to abundance...

12:14.756 --> 12:18.852
from abundance to complacency.
From complacency to apathy...

12:19.194 --> 12:21.253
from apathy back to bondage.

12:21.330 --> 12:25.232
If we're to be the exception to history,
then we must break the cycle.

12:25.968 --> 12:29.460
For those who do not remember
the past are condemned to repeat it.

12:33.575 --> 12:35.634
Very good, everybody.
Very good.

12:37.479 --> 12:38.309
Hold this.

12:38.547 --> 12:42.142
Okay, remember, no running
till you get out to the playground.

12:42.584 --> 12:45.303
Your last one was great.
I'd like to use it on the news.

12:45.320 --> 12:46.184
- Molly?
- Yes.

12:46.421 --> 12:47.581
Molly, come here.

12:48.624 --> 12:51.843
This is Ms. Madison.
She's the reporter from the news.

12:51.860 --> 12:53.248
- Hi, Molly.
- Hi.

12:53.262 --> 12:54.490
- How you doing?
- Good.

12:54.563 --> 12:56.997
Your essay was very thoughtful.

12:57.332 --> 12:58.094
Thanks.

12:58.467 --> 13:00.992
Ms. Madison is going
to show your essay tonight.

13:01.003 --> 13:02.994
- Isn't that exciting?
- Yes, madam.

13:03.071 --> 13:06.507
Tell me something. What do you
want to be when you grow up?

13:09.678 --> 13:13.978
I go back and forth. Either
a veterinarian or chairman of the Fed.

13:18.687 --> 13:19.483
Where's Bud?

13:19.888 --> 13:24.382
Went to take a leak half an hour ago.
I heard his name over the loudspeaker.

13:25.661 --> 13:26.889
What'd you have for lunch?

13:27.262 --> 13:30.356
- Egg salad. You?
- Hard boiled.

13:35.837 --> 13:36.599
Hey, Bud.

13:39.508 --> 13:40.998
Just giving you a heads up.

13:43.812 --> 13:46.076
Management wants us
to cut another ten percent.

13:46.581 --> 13:50.779
Well,
you are management, Carl.

13:51.119 --> 13:54.418
Look, you haven't punched
in on time in six months.

13:54.656 --> 14:00.390
So, I'm five minutes late every once
in a while. What is the big whoop?

14:00.462 --> 14:04.159
You took thirty-one
sick days this year, Bud.

14:06.034 --> 14:10.027
Well, I gotta kid, Carl.
She brings it home from school.

14:29.024 --> 14:30.685
<i>Shit! Goddamnit!</i>

14:51.546 --> 14:53.741
Well, hell, Carl!

14:54.616 --> 14:57.517
You could have showed me
your footage when you walked in.

14:58.720 --> 15:03.054
I know we went to school together, Bud.
I've always liked you.

15:04.226 --> 15:07.024
You gotta give me one good
reason why I should keep you.

15:10.098 --> 15:11.360
Why I can keep you.

15:43.498 --> 15:44.590
All hellsabelle!

15:49.438 --> 15:50.962
Sorry you lost your job.

15:51.106 --> 15:54.041
That's alright, Henry. Just...

15:56.244 --> 16:01.705
As soon as take your money,
I'm going from fired to retired.

16:02.317 --> 16:04.046
- Hey, Bud!
- Yes?

16:04.486 --> 16:05.919
Molly is on TV!

16:07.823 --> 16:09.620
- <i>Apathy back to bondage.</i>
- Geez!

16:09.925 --> 16:13.691
<i>If we are to be the exception to history,</i>
<i>then we must break the cycle.</i>

16:14.529 --> 16:16.759
- Curly, what time you got?
- Nine past seven.

16:17.566 --> 16:18.191
God!

16:19.968 --> 16:22.630
God, man! Shit!

16:41.389 --> 16:42.720
Goddamnit!

19:24.119 --> 19:25.746
PLEASE,
INSERT YOUR BALLOT

19:25.754 --> 19:29.417
ERROR CODE - RESTART

20:32.053 --> 20:33.577
I hurt the top of my head.

20:34.489 --> 20:35.478
Come on, lay down.

20:47.268 --> 20:48.997
I'm so sorry, baby.

21:00.181 --> 21:01.671
I want to live with Mom.

21:07.522 --> 21:08.181
Me too.

21:23.404 --> 21:26.658
<i>New Mexico</i>
<i>is a classic swing state.</i>

21:26.674 --> 21:28.301
- <i>Mrs. Madison?</i>
- Speaking.

21:28.543 --> 21:31.307
<i>I'm calling</i>
<i>from the New Mexico election board.</i>

21:31.379 --> 21:34.132
- The what?
- <i>The New Mexico election board.</i>

21:34.149 --> 21:37.983
<i>Madam, did you cast your vote</i>
<i>at a Texico polling station last night?</i>

21:38.286 --> 21:40.311
I voted in the morning.

21:40.455 --> 21:42.343
<i>In the morning. Alright.</i>

21:42.357 --> 21:43.255
Is there something the matter?

21:43.558 --> 21:46.049
<i>No, no, sorry to bother you.</i>

21:46.060 --> 21:48.722
<i>It is amazing. With every state</i>
<i>but New Mexico reporting...</i>

21:48.930 --> 21:51.490
<i>we're now in a dead heat</i>
<i>for the American presidency.</i>

21:51.633 --> 21:54.625
<i>Each candidate with virtually</i>
<i>the same amount of electoral votes.</i>

21:54.702 --> 21:58.627
<i>270, the magic number to win.</i>
<i>This is a real photo finish!</i>

21:58.640 --> 22:00.904
<i>And it goes to whoever wins</i>
<i>the popular vote in the state.</i>

22:00.975 --> 22:03.705
<i>All five electoral college votes</i>
<i>then swing to that party.</i>

22:03.778 --> 22:05.996
<i>Well, they don't call it the land</i>
<i>of enchantment for nothing.</i>

22:06.014 --> 22:08.608
<i>Whoever takes New Mexico,</i>
<i>takes the White House.</i>

22:08.683 --> 22:13.916
<i>It's déjà vu again. 2000 presidential</i>
<i>election came down to Dade County.</i>

22:13.988 --> 22:19.051
<i>400 votes in the state of Florida,</i>
<i>out of a total of 105 million cast.</i>

22:19.060 --> 22:23.827
<i>If this is a certified tie, neither the</i>
<i>candidate would receive the majority.</i>

22:24.065 --> 22:27.694
<i>Do we even have a president</i>
<i>to deal with this?</i>

22:27.836 --> 22:30.964
<i>Pursuant to the 12th amendment, the</i>
<i>House of Representatives would decide.</i>

22:30.972 --> 22:32.894
<i>That hasn't happened since...</i>

22:32.907 --> 22:37.674
<i>John Quincy Adams defeated</i>
<i>Andrew Jackson back in 1824.</i>

22:37.812 --> 22:39.370
<i>We're talking rare.</i>

22:39.647 --> 22:42.810
<i>No, this isn't a great civics lesson</i>
<i>to the people of this country?</i>

22:43.051 --> 22:48.011
<i>If anyone in New Mexico didn't vote,</i>
<i>he be kicking themselves right now.</i>

22:48.022 --> 22:52.652
<i>The latest reports coming in,</i>
<i>Curry County still too close to call.</i>

22:52.760 --> 22:56.719
<i>This election is down to a single</i>
<i>county. Is this even possible?</i>

22:57.899 --> 23:01.665
Listen, John, there's only 653
registered voters in Texico.

23:01.736 --> 23:03.363
<i>And they've already</i>
<i>recounted those votes.</i>

23:03.438 --> 23:07.135
I know. With that information
and a dollar, I could buy a chalupa!

23:07.275 --> 23:09.743
Everyone I know who voted
has been personally called.

23:10.645 --> 23:11.703
So what?

23:12.013 --> 23:14.504
So, the election. The fact
that it's down to Curry County...

23:14.849 --> 23:16.783
it has something
to do with Texico.

23:17.819 --> 23:19.719
Oh my God. Call you back!

23:39.340 --> 23:39.669
Bud!

23:41.709 --> 23:42.232
Come on!

23:43.778 --> 23:46.246
God, my head!

23:50.718 --> 23:52.811
What? What time is it?

23:53.087 --> 23:54.486
There's some people
here to see you.

23:55.523 --> 23:56.251
Some people?

23:57.058 --> 23:58.252
They look official.

24:01.562 --> 24:04.463
- Child services?
- That's what I'm thinking.

24:16.377 --> 24:18.345
- Okay.
- Here we go.

24:23.785 --> 24:26.948
Mr. Johnson, we would have called first,
but you don't have a telephone.

24:27.388 --> 24:31.415
No, no, no, we got a phone.

24:31.993 --> 24:34.848
It's just not connected right now.
But I'm on it, you know.

24:34.862 --> 24:37.854
I'm not gonna say it's been easy
since the wife left, but...

24:38.032 --> 24:40.227
- we're getting on fine.
- Sure are.

24:40.435 --> 24:45.737
And I'm gonna pay these off, I swear.
Just as soon as I find a new job.

24:45.907 --> 24:47.966
- A new job?
- Yes.

24:48.209 --> 24:53.272
I used to be in this Willy Nelson
tribute band. I was thinking about...

24:53.281 --> 24:58.082
getting the guys back together again,
soon as our bass player gets paroled.

24:58.386 --> 25:01.184
And the drinking, I know it,
I know it looks bad.

25:01.689 --> 25:05.090
And licking that sucker
is at the top of my list.

25:05.593 --> 25:08.153
Please don't take away from me.

25:09.464 --> 25:11.227
I'll do anything you say,
I swear.

25:13.501 --> 25:14.968
She's just my only good thing.

25:15.636 --> 25:18.230
Mr. Johnson,
we're not from Social Services.

25:20.008 --> 25:20.565
No?

25:21.442 --> 25:23.034
We're from the State
Election Bureau.

25:23.745 --> 25:27.044
Fuck! Thank you, Jesus!

25:30.051 --> 25:33.384
I'm Secretary of State Brower.
And this is Attorney General Wyatt.

25:33.454 --> 25:36.252
Mr. Johnson,
did you cast your vote last night?

25:37.458 --> 25:38.618
Last night, did you vote?

25:39.560 --> 25:45.328
That's right,
it's my civic duty, isn't it?

25:45.566 --> 25:46.692
Indeed it is.

25:47.535 --> 25:50.504
Mr. Johnson,
is this your signature?

25:55.443 --> 25:56.375
I guess.

25:56.644 --> 25:57.963
You guess it's your signature?

25:57.979 --> 26:02.541
No, no. That's right.
That's my signature.

26:03.117 --> 26:04.379
Did you retain your stub?

26:05.753 --> 26:06.583
What stub?

26:07.021 --> 26:09.285
The perforated stub
on top of your ballot.

26:16.130 --> 26:21.830
Where's that perforated stub
that I gave you for your school project?

26:22.470 --> 26:23.232
I've got it.

26:35.683 --> 26:36.377
It's him.

26:36.884 --> 26:39.045
Yeah, it's him. What do you mean,
"him?" Me, him?

26:41.189 --> 26:42.486
Sir, your vote didn't count.

26:43.257 --> 26:45.748
Mr. Johnson,
it's our duty to inform you...

26:45.760 --> 26:49.628
that you are entitled to recast
your ballot in a timely manner.

26:50.264 --> 26:52.289
What if I don't want to?

26:53.768 --> 26:54.393
Bud!

26:56.604 --> 27:01.166
Alright then, how about if I, how
about if I just whisper it to you then?

27:01.175 --> 27:03.643
Right here we'd get it over with,
right now and you can listen too!

27:03.711 --> 27:06.043
No, sir, there are strict rules
and legal procedures.

27:06.114 --> 27:10.073
Legal shit. Shit, fellas,
I can't afford a lawyer.

27:10.384 --> 27:13.114
You're not in trouble.
You don't need a lawyer.

27:13.521 --> 27:15.819
However,
I will have to administer an oath.

27:16.057 --> 27:16.955
An oath?

27:17.024 --> 27:18.787
An oath. Please,
place your hand on the Bible.

27:21.429 --> 27:23.397
Do you, Earnest Johnson...

27:23.731 --> 27:26.859
swear to recast your ballot
in the spirit of the law?

27:27.435 --> 27:29.198
Yeah, yes, sure. Okay.

27:29.804 --> 27:30.532
So noted.

27:30.605 --> 27:34.200
A petition will be filed on your behalf
and a date will be set for your revote.

27:34.375 --> 27:39.005
Does this put me
on some sort of fast track list?

27:40.381 --> 27:42.645
You know, for like jury duty?

27:43.684 --> 27:47.745
Considering the gravity of this
situation, keep all of this a secret.

27:49.223 --> 27:50.053
Have a good night.

28:06.407 --> 28:07.101
<i>Sorry.</i>

28:08.075 --> 28:12.034
You should be! I could get into
all kinds of trouble because of you!

28:13.681 --> 28:14.841
Gosh, Molly!

28:14.849 --> 28:18.910
Why can't you
learn just to let things be?

28:19.253 --> 28:23.747
I told you this was important to me,
but you never listen!

28:33.668 --> 28:37.388
<i>Another astonishing development:</i>
<i>New Mexico Elections Bureau is reporting...</i>

28:37.405 --> 28:41.501
<i>a single irregular ballot is holding</i>
<i>up a final decision in the state.</i>

28:41.609 --> 28:45.272
<i>As I said, a single ballot.</i>
<i>That's one vote, folks!</i>

28:45.446 --> 28:48.734
<i>This really couldn't get any stranger,</i>
<i>MSNBC has learned that the voter...</i>

28:48.749 --> 28:51.274
<i>has been identified and has</i>
<i>agreed to recast the ballot.</i>

28:51.786 --> 28:55.779
<i>One voter will decide the fate</i>
<i>of the state's five electoral votes.</i>

28:55.923 --> 29:00.815
<i>On this bizarre day, no one</i>
<i>will soon forget, one American citizen...</i>

29:00.828 --> 29:04.787
<i>will effectively choose the next</i>
<i>President of the United States.</i>

29:06.033 --> 29:08.866
Apparently the electronic
voting machine malfunctioned.

29:08.936 --> 29:11.655
The ballot was scanned, but the machine
died before the vote was counted.

29:11.672 --> 29:12.559
It's an anomaly.

29:12.573 --> 29:14.973
No shit, Larry! What polling
station was the machine in?

29:15.042 --> 29:17.010
Texico, New Mexico, sir.

29:17.812 --> 29:18.938
Is that a place?

29:19.780 --> 29:21.839
Where the hell is Texico?

29:21.916 --> 29:23.679
New Mexico, sir, Curry County.

29:23.751 --> 29:27.016
New Mexico election law dictates
if a voter's right is violated...

29:27.088 --> 29:30.182
The voter shall be-entitled
to recast the ballot. I know.

29:31.392 --> 29:34.850
Alright, kids,
we're going to war.

29:34.962 --> 29:37.123
A map!
Somebody get me a map!

29:37.365 --> 29:41.461
There's one schmuck standing between us
and the White House. Find out who it is.

29:41.769 --> 29:43.202
We can't do that legally.

29:44.672 --> 29:45.570
Just find him.

29:51.379 --> 29:54.314
We were supposed
to my cytoplasm out of Jell-O today.

29:56.017 --> 29:58.770
What kinda kid would rather
sit in a crummy classroom...

29:58.786 --> 30:00.151
than be out here?

30:00.655 --> 30:04.113
What kind of father goes fishing
when he should be looking for a new job?

30:04.458 --> 30:07.018
The kind who would just like...

30:07.028 --> 30:10.964
to spend a little more time
with his daughter.

30:12.066 --> 30:12.828
That's who.

30:13.868 --> 30:15.597
- Fine.
- Fine.

30:18.906 --> 30:19.998
Anyway, I've been thinking.

30:20.508 --> 30:21.770
How refreshing!

30:23.778 --> 30:27.942
Jesus! You gotta quit being
such a smart ass all the time?

30:28.015 --> 30:30.984
And you've got to stop using Jesus
as a cuss word all the time!

30:31.419 --> 30:33.239
He's a billion people's Savior.

30:33.254 --> 30:35.347
Alright, fine, okay?
I get it.

30:36.424 --> 30:37.857
- Fine.
- Fine.

30:45.132 --> 30:48.420
I wish...
your mom could be here...

30:48.436 --> 30:50.996
to talk to you about
everything that's going on.

30:53.874 --> 30:55.239
I really do.

30:56.210 --> 30:59.907
No, she... no, she can't.

31:02.116 --> 31:03.105
She's just, she can't, baby.

31:07.855 --> 31:08.321
Bud.

31:12.660 --> 31:15.220
Next Tuesday, is bring
your father to school day.

31:17.498 --> 31:20.023
- So?
- I want you to come.

31:23.437 --> 31:26.133
It's not gonna embarrass
you that I don't have a job?

31:26.607 --> 31:27.767
I don't care.

31:28.642 --> 31:29.870
I want you to come anyway.

31:35.683 --> 31:37.708
- Think you can remember?
- Of course.

31:39.553 --> 31:40.178
How?

31:40.955 --> 31:41.922
Well...

31:43.891 --> 31:45.449
I'll write it on my forehead.

31:55.236 --> 31:56.635
Can I go to school, now?

32:00.608 --> 32:03.509
Yes. Just one more cast.

32:14.488 --> 32:15.682
Why don't you go
start the truck.

32:31.105 --> 32:35.474
Try to get a two shot, alright?
Okay, come on!

32:35.776 --> 32:36.765
Earnest Johnson!

32:37.478 --> 32:39.309
- Yes?
- Kate Madison.

32:40.114 --> 32:41.206
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

32:43.918 --> 32:46.352
Shit! You're the lady
from the news.

32:46.420 --> 32:48.718
I am, and I'd like
to ask you a few questions.

32:48.789 --> 32:51.155
You know, you're much prettier
than you are on the TV.

32:51.592 --> 32:52.479
Thanks. I would...

32:52.493 --> 32:56.122
Don't get me wrong,
you're pretty on the TV too.

32:57.331 --> 32:59.663
Just, we got an old set
that kinda "squirshes" you.

32:59.834 --> 33:00.630
Squishes everybody.

33:01.168 --> 33:03.193
I believe, Mr. Johnson.
I believe...

33:03.204 --> 33:04.831
You can call me Bud.

33:05.272 --> 33:08.730
Bud. I was hoping you
could tell me why those men...

33:08.742 --> 33:11.233
flew from Santa Fe,
to see you in the middle of the night.

33:18.786 --> 33:22.813
Well, actually, I kinda promised
to keep that a secret.

33:23.891 --> 33:26.416
You mean,
you're going to recast your vote.

33:28.329 --> 33:31.765
Well, shit, I guess that I guess
it ain't that much of a secret then.

33:32.600 --> 33:36.161
Now, listen, Bud,
you need to watch your language.

33:36.337 --> 33:37.463
- We're taping this for TV, okay?
- The language?

33:38.138 --> 33:41.107
Goddamnit, yes of course!

33:41.242 --> 33:46.646
The question now is, who you voted for
and are you going to vote the same way?

33:48.916 --> 33:50.747
Remind me again who's running?

33:51.685 --> 33:54.677
What you're saying is,
you're keeping an open mind?

33:55.689 --> 33:57.554
Yeah, that's...

33:58.058 --> 33:59.355
That's the kinda guy I am.

34:00.261 --> 34:01.250
You gotta be kidding me!

34:01.929 --> 34:03.954
This is OJ big. Bigger!

34:05.799 --> 34:06.823
I gotta call network!

34:08.202 --> 34:11.797
John,
let me break the story.

34:11.804 --> 34:13.534
I thought I was gonna die
in this shithole.

34:13.674 --> 34:16.268
You said that when the time was right,
you'd give me a chance. That's the time!

34:16.342 --> 34:17.503
We'll be back to a real market.

34:17.645 --> 34:21.467
The city! With elevators and Chinese
restaurants and crime and traffic.

34:21.482 --> 34:24.371
I got the tape
of Mrs. Zachary's prize winning sow.

34:24.385 --> 34:26.319
Screw Mrs. Zachary.
And screw the sow!

34:26.453 --> 34:27.476
You promised me.

34:28.322 --> 34:30.813
Get network on the phone.
Don't screw it up.

34:32.525 --> 34:34.619
- You won't regret it!
- Better not! Darlene!

34:46.072 --> 34:50.065
So... is your dad coming
to talk to our class?

34:51.812 --> 34:56.806
I don't know. Doesn't really leave
the house much since my mom left.

34:58.419 --> 34:59.477
Mine left too.

35:00.354 --> 35:03.323
She's pursuing
a singing career in Albuquerque.

35:05.025 --> 35:07.357
I'm going to move there
when she becomes a big star.

35:07.428 --> 35:09.225
And she's gonna take me
on tour and everything.

35:11.065 --> 35:12.862
She'll probably do
a concert in Austin.

35:14.401 --> 35:15.925
I could get you free tickets.

35:16.503 --> 35:19.063
Maybe.
Guess I could borrow my dad's car.

35:20.240 --> 35:23.869
I'll wait till he gets drunk.
Sometimes he passes out.

35:29.516 --> 35:31.074
Do you think
I could try your skateboard?

35:34.655 --> 35:35.314
Okay.

35:42.429 --> 35:46.832
I'm the king of Curry County, John,
and I've been 15 years at this desk.

35:46.900 --> 35:50.097
I feel for you, Ted.
Don't make me call security.

35:59.313 --> 36:01.178
Holy crap!

36:02.149 --> 36:04.447
You, desk! Sit!

36:05.119 --> 36:07.087
People,
we go live in 30 seconds!

36:07.221 --> 36:09.121
From this point on,
the news counts!

36:09.189 --> 36:13.558
So excited,
I got my accent back. My god!

36:15.629 --> 36:16.596
And cue graphics!

36:17.564 --> 36:18.428
And cue music!

36:19.500 --> 36:21.798
And cue!

36:22.236 --> 36:27.606
Good evening. This is Madison, coming
to you from Curry County, New Mexico.

36:27.775 --> 36:31.211
Over the last 24 hours,
the American political process...

36:31.278 --> 36:35.078
<i>has ground to a virtual standstill</i>
<i>as the world watches...</i>

36:35.315 --> 36:40.150
<i>waiting for the outcome of an election.</i>
<i>Today, I uncovered the identity...</i>

36:40.254 --> 36:43.052
<i>of the person the entire</i>
<i>world has been looking for.</i>

36:43.290 --> 36:46.691
<i>The one swing voter</i>
<i>who will decide the election.</i>

36:46.960 --> 36:50.452
<i>Those of you hoping to hear that</i>
<i>decision will be sorely disappointed.</i>

36:50.664 --> 36:53.895
<i>Because you are about to meet</i>
<i>a registered independent...</i>

36:54.034 --> 36:56.832
<i>who claims to be</i>
<i>keeping an open mind.</i>

36:57.604 --> 37:00.300
<i>Imagine,</i>
<i>on this man's shoulders...</i>

37:00.541 --> 37:03.442
<i>stands the future</i>
<i>of the free world.</i>

37:03.811 --> 37:05.244
Just the kind of guy I am.

37:07.147 --> 37:11.447
Let it never again be said,
that a single vote counts for nothing.

37:21.462 --> 37:21.985
Bud!

37:22.830 --> 37:23.319
Bud!

37:24.465 --> 37:25.090
What?

37:26.100 --> 37:27.624
There's some people outside.

37:28.102 --> 37:32.198
Geez, you gotta stop
waking me up like this, okay?

37:32.706 --> 37:33.934
You're gonna kill me.

37:34.007 --> 37:36.305
There are some people outside!

37:37.778 --> 37:38.506
People?

37:39.680 --> 37:40.544
God!

37:43.250 --> 37:45.218
No, not there! Out front!

37:45.953 --> 37:49.514
Oh, God... What now?

37:51.725 --> 37:53.920
- Dad, hurry up!
- Yeah, I'm going, honey.

37:56.930 --> 37:58.420
There's a lot of people
out there.

37:58.732 --> 38:02.293
Okay, honey, let's see
what the fuss is all about.

38:06.940 --> 38:07.668
<i>Is that him?</i>

38:08.776 --> 38:09.470
Bud!

38:10.544 --> 38:12.034
Mr. Johnson,
any decisions yet?

38:24.992 --> 38:27.517
- Holy shit!
- What do they want?

38:29.229 --> 38:30.161
I don't know.

38:34.268 --> 38:35.360
Go turn the TV on, baby.

38:44.311 --> 38:47.474
<i>We are in the midst</i>
<i>of a historic moment.</i>

38:47.614 --> 38:50.082
<i>The swing voter</i>
<i>has finally been identified.</i>

38:50.250 --> 38:53.481
<i>We go live now to a trailer</i>
<i>in Texico, New Mexico.</i>

38:53.887 --> 38:56.617
<i>Earnest Johnson made</i>
<i>an appearance just moments ago.</i>

38:56.924 --> 38:59.484
<i>Apparently, overwhelmed</i>
<i>by the media presence.</i>

39:00.160 --> 39:03.687
<i>And Mr. Landry, exactly how long</i>
<i>have you known Earnest Johnson?</i>

39:04.331 --> 39:07.232
<i>Earnest Johnson?</i>
<i>Hey, Earnest!</i>

39:08.268 --> 39:11.704
- <i>You mean Bud?</i>
- <i>We all grew up together.</i>

39:12.139 --> 39:14.198
<i>How do you think he's</i>
<i>shouldering the responsibility...</i>

39:14.208 --> 39:16.676
<i>of picking the next President</i>
<i>of the United States?</i>

39:18.812 --> 39:21.713
<i>Well, I'm sure that...</i>

39:22.583 --> 39:26.349
<i>Earnest is...</i>
<i>crapping his pants.</i>

39:29.256 --> 39:31.975
<i>He's a good guy.</i>
<i>He likes to treat them good.</i>

39:31.992 --> 39:34.017
<i>We used to light</i>
<i>the mesa back here on fire!</i>

39:40.968 --> 39:42.265
It's all my fault, isn't it?

39:42.336 --> 39:44.566
No! No, no, no, baby, no.

39:45.138 --> 39:49.040
None of this would have happened
if I hadn't let you down.

39:50.310 --> 39:51.470
What are we gonna do?

39:52.379 --> 39:53.038
Well...

39:56.383 --> 39:57.714
I'm gonna back these people up.

40:04.191 --> 40:06.216
Holy shit!

40:07.828 --> 40:08.852
There's so many!

40:10.764 --> 40:13.858
Ok, I'm just gonna go out there,
right? I'm gonna...

40:15.702 --> 40:19.866
I'm gonna walk out there and tell
those people it wasn't me who voted.

40:20.474 --> 40:21.736
No, you can't!

40:22.109 --> 40:23.076
Why not?

40:23.443 --> 40:25.638
You swore to that judge,
on a Bible and everything.

40:25.712 --> 40:27.942
What? That was the middle
of the night. That can't count!

40:29.449 --> 40:32.748
You were under oath, Bud.
Voter fraud is a felony.

40:32.853 --> 40:35.287
And one more felony
and they take me away from you.

40:35.422 --> 40:37.413
You're right. Shit!
I am down to one!

40:49.369 --> 40:50.336
What do we do?

40:55.842 --> 40:59.175
We lie. We have to.

41:01.982 --> 41:07.648
Okay, that's a good plan.
Just a little white lie is all this is.

41:07.721 --> 41:09.951
- Between us.
- Just between us.

41:10.557 --> 41:13.685
Who knows,
maybe this thing, all these...

41:14.895 --> 41:18.854
Maybe all these people,
they just go away.

41:55.936 --> 41:57.301
Stop! Stop!

42:39.446 --> 42:40.708
What the hell is this?

42:41.181 --> 42:42.614
The biggest space we could find.

42:44.918 --> 42:47.944
How we gonna do this?
Build a campaign around one man?

42:47.954 --> 42:50.354
- I don't know how to do this.
- You're gonna leave it to me.

42:50.524 --> 42:53.288
We're gonna win him, Don!
We're gonna win this guy.

42:53.560 --> 42:55.744
We got the issues on our side!

42:55.762 --> 42:57.514
- There you go!
- He's gonna love me!

42:57.531 --> 42:58.725
What's not to love?

43:02.803 --> 43:06.933
We're in trouble. I need you to dig up
everything you can on Earnest Johnson.

43:07.007 --> 43:08.463
Talk to his family, his friends.

43:08.475 --> 43:10.773
I want to know what he reads,
what television show he watches.

43:10.844 --> 43:15.304
His hobbies, his favorite foods,
his hopes, his dreams, everything.

43:15.849 --> 43:20.183
All we have to do is win
over one American mind!

43:20.887 --> 43:21.979
You know, I was just thinking,
Marty.

43:22.756 --> 43:24.883
I'd like to get to know
this Bud Johnson. Personally.

43:25.158 --> 43:26.125
Okay. Good.

43:26.960 --> 43:28.427
Maybe take him out
for some ice cream.

43:32.299 --> 43:32.958
Ice cream?

43:33.900 --> 43:35.561
What grown man
doesn't like ice cream?

43:39.372 --> 43:42.705
No higher education,
not much lower education.

43:43.009 --> 43:45.170
Divorced single father,
recently laid off.

43:45.245 --> 43:46.337
What's our first step?

43:46.513 --> 43:49.641
Put you in a room together. See if you
persuade him to come over to our side.

43:49.850 --> 43:55.686
I like it. Him and me in a room. Yes,
talking ideas, seeing what comes up.

43:55.789 --> 43:57.711
Great plan.
I'll get you some talking points.

43:57.724 --> 43:59.282
I'm good off the cuff already.

43:59.459 --> 44:04.283
Of course! We're just gonna get
an itty bitty think tank together.

44:04.297 --> 44:08.063
We'll run the data, see what you two
could possibly have in common.

44:08.869 --> 44:10.302
Your petition has been processed.

44:10.537 --> 44:14.997
And in accordance with New Mexico state
law, Chapter 1, Article 13, Section 11.

44:15.008 --> 44:19.297
Could you do us a favor and back
these news people up a little bit?

44:19.312 --> 44:22.304
We could barely
sleep last night.

44:26.386 --> 44:29.412
said voter Earnest Johnson,
is hereby authorized...

44:29.422 --> 44:31.413
to recast his vote 10 days
from today along official.

44:32.392 --> 44:35.020
And there's a fat guy there,
he keeps leaning on my truck...

44:35.028 --> 44:37.087
fixing his hair
in my side mirror.

44:42.502 --> 44:46.256
Said voter, Earnest Johnson,
is hereby authorized to recast his vote...

44:46.273 --> 44:49.731
10 days from today. Along official
documentary notification...

44:49.743 --> 44:51.836
to both state,
federal regulatory authorities.

44:52.345 --> 44:55.041
Bud, life's gonna be
a little different from now on.

44:55.482 --> 44:57.347
You'll need security
around the clock.

44:57.951 --> 44:58.576
For what?

44:59.019 --> 45:00.816
You're a household name.

45:01.154 --> 45:04.180
Every political nut job in the country
is gonna make their way down here.

45:04.324 --> 45:08.784
In 10 days, you gonna make the most
important decision in the free world.

45:08.862 --> 45:11.751
And it is our job to make sure
this thing comes off fair and square.

45:11.765 --> 45:14.734
So, if there's anything
that you think we need to know...

45:19.072 --> 45:19.834
Like what?

45:20.740 --> 45:22.605
Something
we may find out later.

45:23.743 --> 45:25.370
Better now, than later.

45:29.482 --> 45:32.542
No, sir,
there's nothing to know.

45:36.690 --> 45:39.250
Molly! Molly! Molly!

45:39.693 --> 45:42.526
- I don't believe it. She's his daughter!
- Who's his daughter?

45:42.596 --> 45:45.224
The Chairman of the Fed,
the girl that won the essay contest.

45:45.232 --> 45:47.359
Remember, I ran the story on her,
election day?

45:47.834 --> 45:50.769
This is perfect! The network wants
to do an interview with her daddy.

45:51.004 --> 45:52.926
I'm not going
to use this little girl!

45:52.939 --> 45:55.464
I've told you this before.
I have integrity, like Paula Zahn.

45:55.542 --> 45:57.294
I met Paula Zahn.

45:57.310 --> 46:00.006
Paula Zahn eats
where my friend is a waiter, alright?

46:00.080 --> 46:02.640
I don't want to hurt
your feelings, you're no Paula Zahn.

46:02.716 --> 46:03.774
No Paula Zahn?

46:03.883 --> 46:06.374
I booked this story.
It was me.

46:06.386 --> 46:10.516
Yes, that's why everybody here
is trying to rip it out from under you.

46:10.790 --> 46:14.282
You want a desk in New York,
you want a desk in Los Angeles?

46:14.394 --> 46:16.828
Forget everything you learned
in journalism school.

46:16.997 --> 46:21.900
This isn't new anymore. This isn't life.
This is bigger. This is television!

46:53.533 --> 46:56.388
<i>The Johnsons have been virtually</i>
<i>besieged inside their trailer.</i>

46:56.403 --> 46:59.304
<i>but we're lucky to be joined</i>
<i>by their pizza delivery man.</i>

46:59.472 --> 47:02.339
<i>How would you characterize</i>
<i>Earnest Johnson's state of mind?</i>

47:03.243 --> 47:05.507
<i>Mostly I'd say, he was hungry.</i>

47:05.612 --> 47:06.738
<i>He was hungry.</i>

47:07.714 --> 47:08.874
<i>Well, there you have it.</i>

47:08.882 --> 47:10.247
I ain't tipping him anymore.

47:10.517 --> 47:13.179
I ought to trim
Mrs. Hardy's elm.

47:13.887 --> 47:17.846
Looks like it's moving in our roof.
What do you think?

47:18.725 --> 47:21.285
Hard to tell.
What do you think?

47:22.762 --> 47:23.524
Definitely.

47:25.231 --> 47:27.893
<i>Since has become the most Googled</i>
<i>town in the world...</i>

47:28.134 --> 47:30.728
<i>narrowly edging out in Jihad.</i>

48:01.601 --> 48:02.829
Holy crap!

48:03.269 --> 48:04.531
- You Bud?
- Yeah!

48:04.671 --> 48:06.571
You're Richard Petty.

48:06.873 --> 48:07.669
You got it, man.

48:08.108 --> 48:10.406
Hold on. Honey!
It's the king!

48:10.710 --> 48:14.373
I got a friend down the road I want
you to meet. You wanna go for a ride?

48:17.684 --> 48:21.313
Yes!
could my daughter come?

48:21.488 --> 48:24.821
In that case, maybe you'd better
drive. Precious cargo and all!

48:30.397 --> 48:33.093
Just a minute, Mr. Petty.
Hey, Chubby!

48:33.700 --> 48:37.397
Just because it ain't rolling, don't
make it furniture! Back out of here!

48:38.705 --> 48:40.036
Come on, baby! We gotta go!

48:41.107 --> 48:42.369
You're Richard Petty!

48:50.950 --> 48:53.077
Molly! Get a picture, honey.

48:53.620 --> 48:58.387
If you told me two days ago
that I'd be driving your Dodge...

48:58.658 --> 48:59.886
- Did you get it?
- Yes.

49:00.160 --> 49:03.561
Get one more. Get it with my chin
out a little bit. Like that.

49:04.531 --> 49:05.429
Like a hero.

49:06.833 --> 49:08.164
I told you, you crazy!

49:08.468 --> 49:10.163
You ain't seen nothing yet.

49:38.431 --> 49:39.056
Bud!

49:40.233 --> 49:41.894
This is the President's plane.

49:44.471 --> 49:48.567
Hello, you be Molly. I'm Mr. Fox,
I work with the President.

49:48.975 --> 49:50.909
Hi.
Hi. Bud, Martin Fox.

49:51.711 --> 49:53.770
- Hello.
- How are you? Come in.

49:53.847 --> 49:55.576
Take your hat off please.
Your hat.

49:55.949 --> 49:58.315
So, this is the Johnson family.

49:58.885 --> 50:00.546
Welcome to Air Force One.
Hi, Molly.

50:00.753 --> 50:02.277
- Thanks for having us, sir.
- It's a pleasure.

50:02.489 --> 50:04.184
- Mr. President.
- Huh?

50:04.991 --> 50:06.049
Call him Mr. President.

50:08.094 --> 50:09.891
It's an honor, Mr. President.

50:10.063 --> 50:12.122
It's an honor to meet you, Bud.
May I call you Bud?

50:12.232 --> 50:14.291
Yes, Mr. President.

50:14.734 --> 50:15.632
Come on in, come on.

50:17.971 --> 50:18.699
God, this...

50:19.906 --> 50:22.704
This place
is it's really something!

50:24.577 --> 50:26.272
It's my little home in the sky.

50:26.980 --> 50:30.746
It's kinda,
like a trailer with wings.

50:31.651 --> 50:32.845
Fine analogy, Bud.

50:33.319 --> 50:36.288
Molly, I saw your speech
on TV the other night.

50:36.489 --> 50:37.478
Very impressive!

50:39.125 --> 50:42.185
- Say thank you, baby.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

50:42.195 --> 50:44.026
- You must be a very proud father.
- Yes, sir.

50:45.765 --> 50:49.701
God, I'm sorry.
Mr. President.

50:51.237 --> 50:54.593
You can see why she's definitely
the brains of our operation.

50:54.607 --> 50:57.041
I know what you mean.
we all need a Molly.

50:57.477 --> 50:59.308
Marty here, is my Molly.

50:59.579 --> 51:03.936
That's right. Molly,
I bet a smart kid like you...

51:03.950 --> 51:05.645
would love to see the war room.

51:06.586 --> 51:07.644
No, thanks.

51:07.654 --> 51:11.351
Why don't we have a peek and then your
dad and the President can have a talk.

51:11.424 --> 51:14.393
Go on, Honey.
Daddy has to talk to the President.

51:17.797 --> 51:19.162
She's a firecracker!

51:19.232 --> 51:22.133
Yes, sir, she's the whole deal!

51:23.570 --> 51:26.038
I wouldn't mind seeing
the war room, Mr. President.

51:26.739 --> 51:30.470
I'll show it to you later.
And please, call me Andy.

51:31.844 --> 51:32.776
- Andy?
- Yeah.

51:35.181 --> 51:37.809
Are you sure,
that-that other guy...

51:37.817 --> 51:40.377
I know, things can get
a little formal around here.

51:40.653 --> 51:43.121
Commander in Chief, running
the country and all that. Please.

51:43.623 --> 51:46.217
I am just an ordinary man,
like you...

51:46.593 --> 51:48.356
The kinda guy you can sit down
and have a beer with.

51:49.429 --> 51:50.760
Would you like a beer, Bud?

51:54.567 --> 51:55.158
A beer?

51:58.571 --> 51:59.265
No shit?

51:59.973 --> 52:00.735
No shit.

52:02.542 --> 52:03.531
Well, then...

52:04.877 --> 52:07.607
- Yes. Hell, yeah, Andy.
- Okay!

52:08.014 --> 52:09.948
David, would you get us
a couple of beers, please?

52:10.116 --> 52:12.243
- Thank you very much.
- So...

52:12.819 --> 52:15.652
you're gonna have some
story to tell your friends.

52:18.358 --> 52:22.556
I read about you in the paper.
They say you've never lost an election.

52:23.096 --> 52:26.623
That's right. You can learn
a lot from reading the newspaper.

52:27.433 --> 52:31.494
They also said that you don't
believe in anything anymore.

52:32.372 --> 52:34.203
Even if it meant
selling your mother's soul.

52:34.273 --> 52:37.868
No, see, no, see that's libelous,
Because my mother is a wonderful...

52:38.044 --> 52:41.172
wonderful, wonderful woman.

52:54.761 --> 52:56.524
If you met my mother,
you'd understand.

52:58.631 --> 52:59.825
You a football fan, Bud?

53:01.034 --> 53:04.561
Well, I'm an American, aren't I?

53:06.439 --> 53:08.464
I played a little in high school.

53:08.975 --> 53:10.306
Did you now? What position?

53:10.443 --> 53:11.432
I was quarterback.

53:11.878 --> 53:16.577
I always thought football was
a strategic game. A lot like diplomacy.

53:16.649 --> 53:20.301
You got your offense, your defense,
the President is like your quarterback...

53:20.319 --> 53:21.786
and the American voters...

53:22.588 --> 53:25.489
Well... they're like the coach.

53:27.427 --> 53:28.826
Never thought of it that way.

53:28.895 --> 53:30.487
Now the coach's job
is to make sure...

53:30.496 --> 53:34.557
that the right man has
the football at the critical time.

53:35.101 --> 53:37.069
I know exactly what you mean,
Andy.

53:37.970 --> 53:38.698
Do you?

53:41.541 --> 53:42.439
Maybe not.

53:46.245 --> 53:47.405
Bring in the football, please.

53:50.783 --> 53:51.249
Bud.

53:53.986 --> 53:55.044
You wanna hold the football?

53:56.756 --> 53:57.882
There's a football in there?

54:03.196 --> 54:05.221
That case holds
the launch codes...

54:05.765 --> 54:07.596
to America's nuclear arsenal.

54:09.068 --> 54:10.501
That's what
this election's all about.

54:11.771 --> 54:16.799
launch codes like...
missiles and shit?

54:16.876 --> 54:20.312
I want you to pretend
that America is a team...

54:21.247 --> 54:23.579
- and you're the coach.
- Okay.

54:23.649 --> 54:27.335
Let's say it's the 4th quarter. We've
got possession, but we're down by five.

54:27.353 --> 54:29.776
North Korea has us pinned
in our own fifteenth line...

54:29.789 --> 54:34.726
with one second on the dooms day clock.
What are you doing to do?

54:34.894 --> 54:39.957
Okay, you go long. The only thing
standing between victory and defeat...

54:40.466 --> 54:42.661
is a successful Hail Mary.
One play.

54:43.436 --> 54:44.994
Who are you
gonna give the ball to, Bud?

54:45.071 --> 54:48.393
Do you pin your hopes on some
liberal second string quarterback...

54:48.407 --> 54:51.638
who hasn't had five minutes
in the big show? Of course you don't.

54:53.713 --> 54:55.044
You do the smart thing.

54:55.681 --> 54:59.276
The only thing. You go
with your strongest arm, the man...

54:59.285 --> 55:01.219
who's carried you through the season,
who's never let you down.

55:07.393 --> 55:09.861
Bud, America's counting on you.

55:10.429 --> 55:14.058
Yes, sir.
I'm not gonna let them down.

55:14.600 --> 55:15.464
But, here.

55:18.371 --> 55:20.839
Wouldn't want to drop
the old football.

55:21.707 --> 55:23.072
Blow up France or something.

55:24.477 --> 55:25.193
You couldn't.

55:25.211 --> 55:29.841
There's a whole bunch of secret
codes and these special little keys.

55:30.383 --> 55:31.042
Here's to you!

55:33.519 --> 55:36.750
Look at all... Look at all
this stuff they give us, Molly.

55:37.390 --> 55:40.826
They give us the same shampoo
that the President uses.

55:41.227 --> 55:42.194
Great.

55:47.834 --> 55:49.961
So, what did you guys talk about?

55:53.372 --> 55:55.533
- Stuff.
- What stuff?

55:55.808 --> 55:56.832
You know...

55:58.611 --> 55:59.703
grown up stuff.

56:00.046 --> 56:01.035
Like?

56:02.215 --> 56:03.375
Like...

56:07.954 --> 56:08.579
Bud!

56:10.389 --> 56:11.583
What stuff?

56:11.657 --> 56:14.785
Like grown up stuff.
You know, coaching. Football.

56:15.361 --> 56:17.124
Geothermal nuclear war.

56:19.699 --> 56:22.099
Andy's, a great... great guy.

56:22.168 --> 56:25.695
He's not Andy.
He's the President of the United States.

56:25.838 --> 56:26.998
And he just wants your vote.

56:27.773 --> 56:30.298
And gee, guess what?
He's gonna get it.

56:30.409 --> 56:32.036
It's not even yours to give!

56:33.679 --> 56:34.338
You're gonna...

56:37.250 --> 56:38.649
ruin everything.

56:39.886 --> 56:42.684
Andy, the President,
invited me to watch the game...

56:42.855 --> 56:44.482
- with him on Monday night.
- That's a bribe!

56:44.490 --> 56:46.515
That's not a bribe.

56:46.592 --> 56:47.718
- Is too.
- It is not.

56:47.793 --> 56:49.021
- Is too.
- It is not.

56:49.095 --> 56:51.461
- Is too!
- Is not! What it is, "too"?

56:52.832 --> 56:54.857
- What the hell do you know?
- More than you.

56:54.867 --> 56:55.959
- You do not.
- Do too.

56:55.968 --> 56:57.731
- You do not.
- Do too.

57:01.641 --> 57:03.233
- Fine.
- Fine.

57:09.382 --> 57:11.714
Did you smell
all the leather on that plane?

57:17.924 --> 57:20.518
<i>If I made you feel second best</i>

57:22.428 --> 57:24.726
<i>I'm sorry I was blind</i>

57:25.631 --> 57:27.531
No, baby, leave it, leave it.
That's Willie.

57:29.802 --> 57:32.327
<i>You were always on my mind</i>

57:36.108 --> 57:37.234
<i>Hi, I'm Willie Nelson.</i>

57:37.243 --> 57:40.371
<i>And when I'm not performing,</i>
<i>I'm usually getting involved.</i>

57:40.780 --> 57:43.874
<i>Hey, Bud, if you're out there</i>
<i>and you're watching...</i>

57:44.283 --> 57:45.716
He's talking to us!

57:45.785 --> 57:49.642
<i>There's a special dinner,</i>
<i>especially for you in your honor...</i>

57:49.655 --> 57:55.321
<i>hosted by my good friend and</i>
<i>Presidential candidate Donald Greenleaf.</i>

57:55.561 --> 57:57.961
- <i>I'll see you here tonight.</i>
- I'll do it, Willie!

58:00.967 --> 58:02.832
This is really getting weird.

58:30.863 --> 58:32.387
Democrat or a Republican?

58:32.398 --> 58:35.834
I'm Art Crumb,
Donald Greenleaf's campaign manager.

58:36.102 --> 58:37.899
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

58:38.270 --> 58:43.207
You must be Molly. Quite an essay.
You have a future in politics one day.

58:43.542 --> 58:45.373
You might too. One day.

58:48.381 --> 58:49.109
Shall we go in?

58:52.018 --> 58:53.986
Not too hard to be nice,
come on.

58:54.787 --> 58:56.584
Party. Party!

58:57.490 --> 59:00.254
Right this way...
make yourselves at home.

59:02.929 --> 59:03.395
Hello.

59:03.864 --> 59:06.094
As you can see,
we've got a lovely buffet.

59:06.266 --> 59:07.597
Would you like a bud, Bud?

59:09.469 --> 59:10.094
Sure.

59:11.338 --> 59:15.434
Look at that.
You got chipped meat on toast.

59:16.276 --> 59:17.675
My momma used
to make that for me.

59:18.378 --> 59:20.096
- No kidding?
- Yes.

59:20.113 --> 59:21.808
There's all you can eat.

59:22.349 --> 59:23.373
It's all in your honor.

59:23.750 --> 59:26.344
And there's all the Willie Nelson
you can listen to.

59:26.620 --> 59:28.417
I understand
you're an aficionado.

59:28.622 --> 59:32.422
Yes, sir, I was in an all Willie
tribute band for about five years.

59:32.726 --> 59:34.250
Called ourselves
The Half Nelsons.

59:35.162 --> 59:36.220
Only his songs?

59:36.530 --> 59:39.363
No other request.
But you know, I got my own stuff.

59:40.600 --> 59:42.830
So, why don't you guys
do one of your songs tonight?

59:45.272 --> 59:49.675
I would but my rhythm
section's incarcerated.

59:50.510 --> 59:52.000
We've pulled a few strings.

59:52.212 --> 59:55.067
- Hey, Bud! Bud!
- Hey, boys!

59:55.082 --> 59:55.912
Come on up!

59:56.950 --> 59:57.974
They paying us?

59:58.051 --> 01:00:01.646
You really did, you got them out.
Thank you. Pull strings.

01:00:01.888 --> 01:00:06.882
Bud! Buddy, Buddy!
Buddy, look at me!

01:00:07.494 --> 01:00:11.897
Damn, Hank, you look good.
Just like prom.

01:00:13.433 --> 01:00:19.303
Thank you. Thank you, amigo.
This is the best day of my life.

01:00:23.343 --> 01:00:26.005
There's someone very
special I'd like you to meet.

01:00:27.514 --> 01:00:29.277
Mr. Johnson!

01:00:34.688 --> 01:00:36.178
Donald Greenleaf.

01:00:36.389 --> 01:00:37.185
Too tight.

01:00:45.165 --> 01:00:47.463
Hell of a party you got here,
Mr. Greenleaf.

01:00:47.534 --> 01:00:51.368
Yes, sir. We democrats
are one hell of a party.

01:00:52.706 --> 01:00:53.798
Call me Don.

01:00:56.776 --> 01:00:57.743
Okay, Don.

01:00:59.346 --> 01:01:00.335
The stage awaits.

01:01:04.684 --> 01:01:06.015
Well, he said so, right?

01:01:33.346 --> 01:01:35.940
<i>Pontiac, Pontiac</i>

01:01:36.149 --> 01:01:39.050
<i>Out there in my backyard.</i>

01:01:39.152 --> 01:01:43.612
<i>I'm gonna fix it up, paint it red</i>
<i>gonna make that engine go</i>

01:01:48.395 --> 01:01:50.886
<i>Chevrolet, Chevrolet</i>

01:01:51.097 --> 01:01:53.691
<i>Chevy year that running</i>
<i>Past fly, this and that</i>

01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:59.402
<i>Gonna make that engine go</i>
<i>You ready?</i>

01:02:01.808 --> 01:02:06.268
<i>They're all in my backyard</i>
<i>Them old cars</i>

01:02:07.314 --> 01:02:09.498
<i>I love everyone of them</i>

01:02:09.516 --> 01:02:12.007
Molly?
You remember me?

01:02:13.253 --> 01:02:14.481
Hi, Ms. Madison.

01:02:15.989 --> 01:02:17.889
Don't worry,
I didn't bring a camera.

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:23.088
<i>I'm gonna get one running yet.</i>

01:02:25.098 --> 01:02:29.296
All this craziness.
I don't know how you're doing it.

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:37.532
If you ever want to talk,
you call me anytime, okay?

01:02:38.211 --> 01:02:41.078
I'm gonna give you my card.
There you go.

01:02:44.451 --> 01:02:46.442
You want an interview
with Bud, right?

01:02:47.921 --> 01:02:49.218
I'd like him to think about it.

01:02:53.426 --> 01:02:54.120
Okay.

01:02:54.694 --> 01:02:57.527
<i>I'll get one running yet</i>

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:02.925
<i>I'll get one running yet</i>

01:03:06.306 --> 01:03:08.638
<i>I'll get one running yet</i>

01:03:16.283 --> 01:03:19.252
<i>I'll get one running yet</i>

01:03:22.555 --> 01:03:24.853
<i>I'll get one running yet</i>

01:03:35.902 --> 01:03:37.529
Bud! You're the man!

01:03:41.975 --> 01:03:44.876
Well... I like you, Bud.

01:03:45.312 --> 01:03:48.679
You seem to be a real
genuine sort of guy.

01:03:48.748 --> 01:03:49.578
Thanks, Don.

01:03:49.849 --> 01:03:52.340
Tell me about yourself.
You got any hobbies?

01:03:53.119 --> 01:03:54.051
Just...

01:03:55.588 --> 01:03:56.953
just fishing.

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:01.725
You're a fellow angler!

01:04:03.096 --> 01:04:04.495
What kind of rod do you use?

01:04:04.731 --> 01:04:09.395
Well, I use a six and a half foot
graphite Johnny Morris signature series.

01:04:10.437 --> 01:04:10.926
Heavy?

01:04:12.205 --> 01:04:13.069
Medium heavy.

01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:16.636
Bait catching reel,
twelve pound test.

01:04:18.511 --> 01:04:19.273
Don't tell me.

01:04:19.979 --> 01:04:23.608
Seven inch power grub,
purple shaky worm.

01:04:25.452 --> 01:04:29.411
Yes, sir! Damn, he, he,
you know your equipment!

01:04:29.622 --> 01:04:31.419
I figured you for a bass man.

01:04:31.658 --> 01:04:32.682
Well, I...

01:04:32.859 --> 01:04:35.259
try to take Molly out
as much as I can.

01:04:35.428 --> 01:04:38.192
We caught a two dinner stripe
on the Pecos just the other day.

01:04:39.132 --> 01:04:40.793
I'm sorry to hear that, Bud.

01:04:41.901 --> 01:04:42.560
Why?

01:04:42.869 --> 01:04:47.306
There's a bill in the House
targeting the Pecos River for...

01:04:48.308 --> 01:04:49.366
reallocation.

01:04:52.645 --> 01:04:53.873
You lost me there.

01:04:54.481 --> 01:04:56.881
That's where a big
corporation builds a dam.

01:04:57.317 --> 01:05:00.684
Limits the flow of water, the fish
can't get to their spawning grounds...

01:05:01.154 --> 01:05:03.520
eventually the whole
population dies off.

01:05:05.692 --> 01:05:10.254
That sucks, because I've been
fishing there my whole life.

01:05:10.597 --> 01:05:13.885
You'd better look for another river,
because President Boone has received...

01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:17.165
ten million dollars in contributions
from the energy company...

01:05:17.337 --> 01:05:19.669
and he's got to pay
them back somehow.

01:05:20.573 --> 01:05:25.067
Come on, now. Come on,
Andy wouldn't do that.

01:05:25.512 --> 01:05:28.447
He already did, Bud.
He already did.

01:05:30.717 --> 01:05:32.480
Okay. Can't you do something?

01:05:32.852 --> 01:05:34.319
If I'm elected President.

01:05:44.831 --> 01:05:45.320
What?

01:05:45.865 --> 01:05:48.299
No, tell me
exactly what was said.

01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:54.539
It's my commitment to protect
the wild places in this country...

01:05:54.908 --> 01:05:56.307
for future generations.

01:05:56.943 --> 01:05:58.740
And I'm not going
to stop there, Bud.

01:05:59.712 --> 01:06:02.306
With your help,
my administration...

01:06:02.515 --> 01:06:05.040
will be a leader
in environmental protections.

01:06:22.836 --> 01:06:24.064
My fellow Americans...

01:06:24.604 --> 01:06:29.735
I give you, the Pecos River
National Wildlife Preserve!

01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:47.687
And what can only be characterized
as a complete policy reversal...

01:06:47.794 --> 01:06:51.423
the President has surely
alienated his corporate donors...

01:06:51.498 --> 01:06:54.262
by adopting
a pro-environment stance.

01:06:54.667 --> 01:06:56.555
Bud and Molly Johnson
were on hand today...

01:06:56.569 --> 01:06:58.230
We are the environmental party!

01:06:59.572 --> 01:07:01.540
Those bastards
stole our platform.

01:07:02.342 --> 01:07:05.527
Put the PR people on standby.

01:07:05.545 --> 01:07:08.514
- You want Spiegelman Fischer?
- Too high brow.

01:07:08.815 --> 01:07:11.340
- What about those iPod guys?
- No, Larry, too urban.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:15.613
Get the guys
who do those Miller Lite spots.

01:07:15.688 --> 01:07:17.883
The ones with those girls
wrestling in the fountain.

01:07:18.258 --> 01:07:19.520
I don't know, Mr. Crumb.

01:07:19.592 --> 01:07:22.117
I like the narrator's voice.
His cadence.

01:07:23.563 --> 01:07:24.359
Just call them.

01:07:24.697 --> 01:07:28.189
Galena hates those ads, Artie,
she says they send the wrong message.

01:07:28.201 --> 01:07:31.170
Your wife's not our target demographic,
that son of a bitch is.

01:07:33.873 --> 01:07:34.737
Great.

01:07:36.609 --> 01:07:38.702
He's got the Secret Service
running flight patterns!

01:07:45.151 --> 01:07:49.679
All we need is an issue
that matters to this guy.

01:07:49.923 --> 01:07:51.788
One issue, one man...

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:55.088
one vote.

01:07:59.399 --> 01:08:00.491
Boy.

01:08:05.538 --> 01:08:06.368
I already own it.

01:08:07.173 --> 01:08:09.573
Alright, I'm gonna buy a hotel.

01:08:16.783 --> 01:08:20.116
Hi, there.
I've got a delivery for Bud Johnson.

01:08:20.819 --> 01:08:21.444
From who?

01:08:23.156 --> 01:08:24.054
From everyone.

01:08:47.279 --> 01:08:49.770
<i>Tell me,</i>
<i>what drives Bud Johnson?</i>

01:08:52.952 --> 01:08:56.444
<i>Right now,</i>
<i>an '89 Chevy Silverado.</i>

01:08:57.991 --> 01:09:01.392
<i>You don't have to lift that up.</i>
<i>If you leave it, it's probably better.</i>

01:09:01.461 --> 01:09:04.385
- This thing is getting away from you.
- I'm doing the best I can.

01:09:04.397 --> 01:09:07.685
Do better! I thought you wanted
to get out of this shithole town!

01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:09.167
I want to get out the facts!

01:09:11.804 --> 01:09:14.068
You hear that? The clicking.

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.006
Click, click.

01:09:16.776 --> 01:09:20.712
The sound of a million remote controls
changing the channel on your ass.

01:09:20.912 --> 01:09:22.846
Click equals death!

01:09:23.249 --> 01:09:26.468
You got to get people a reason to watch.
This is the prime time news.

01:09:26.486 --> 01:09:28.578
The key word, being new!

01:09:29.455 --> 01:09:32.582
Find me something.
You just got taken down by Mary Hart!

01:09:33.459 --> 01:09:38.555
<i>Bud, in looking at it, is there</i>
<i>any issue in particular that...</i>

01:09:38.564 --> 01:09:40.122
has touched you personally?

01:09:41.501 --> 01:09:45.130
Yeah, yeah, insourcing.

01:09:45.638 --> 01:09:47.299
You mean, outsourcing.

01:09:47.473 --> 01:09:49.497
No, I mean in.

01:09:49.975 --> 01:09:52.001
- Can you elaborate?
- Yeah, well...

01:09:52.011 --> 01:09:56.072
where I used to work, there's a bunch
of guys I know, they got laid off.

01:09:57.016 --> 01:10:01.237
Instead of sending our jobs,
losing our jobs to Mexico...

01:10:01.254 --> 01:10:03.779
they're bringing
in Mexicans to take our jobs.

01:10:06.059 --> 01:10:07.253
And we're out.

01:10:07.927 --> 01:10:11.215
Wait a minute, could I say that again?
I don't think that came out right.

01:10:11.230 --> 01:10:12.492
That came out great.

01:10:13.566 --> 01:10:15.124
That came out very well,
Mr. Johnson.

01:10:16.402 --> 01:10:18.597
Very authentic.
Central casting?

01:10:19.038 --> 01:10:20.130
Border patrol?

01:10:22.041 --> 01:10:24.475
So, they're actual
undocumented workers?

01:10:25.178 --> 01:10:27.305
We prefer undocumented actors.

01:10:29.449 --> 01:10:31.883
Alright, rehearsal's up,
back it into one please!

01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:40.418
But we courted
the Pro-Immigrant movement.

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:44.621
Inclusiveness is the foundation
of our party. It's our base!

01:10:44.697 --> 01:10:48.155
We no longer have a base.
Bud Johnson's our base.

01:10:48.367 --> 01:10:50.665
I don't even recognize
myself anymore.

01:10:51.504 --> 01:10:53.495
And what about...
Rainbow House?

01:10:53.706 --> 01:10:56.971
Screw!
This guy cares about immigration.

01:10:57.343 --> 01:11:00.506
You wanna win? Go out there and rip
the Statue of Liberty a new one!

01:11:01.314 --> 01:11:02.645
And action!

01:11:03.282 --> 01:11:06.968
Bud, in the last four years,
President Boone...

01:11:06.986 --> 01:11:11.082
has allowed millions of illegal
aliens to cross the border...

01:11:11.157 --> 01:11:15.184
Flooding cities like Los Angeles,
New York and Texico.

01:11:15.328 --> 01:11:19.719
With your help, Bud, my administration
will mend our broken borders...

01:11:19.732 --> 01:11:21.666
and stop insourcing.

01:11:22.034 --> 01:11:25.003
A vote for Greenleaf
is a vote for America...

01:11:25.471 --> 01:11:28.599
An America
where Americans come first.

01:11:28.741 --> 01:11:32.802
<i>This land is our land, Bud.</i>
<i>Help me keep it that way.</i>

01:11:35.248 --> 01:11:39.048
<i>Dear Tommy, I was very moved</i>
<i>by the letter from your 6th grade class.</i>

01:11:39.485 --> 01:11:41.919
<i>Global warming</i>
<i>is a serious issue...</i>

01:11:42.121 --> 01:11:45.750
<i>and I promise to make it a top priority</i>
<i>in my discussions with the candidates.</i>

01:11:45.758 --> 01:11:48.522
<i>"Dear Mrs. Anderson,</i>
<i>thank you for your letter.</i>

01:11:48.795 --> 01:11:53.220
<i>I am doing everything I can to press</i>
<i>the candidates about health insurance."</i>

01:11:53.232 --> 01:11:56.690
<i>"Dear Mr. Olsen, I sympathize</i>
<i>with your fears about job security.</i>

01:11:56.769 --> 01:11:59.397
<i>I promise you,</i>
<i>I will not ignore the issues...</i>

01:11:59.472 --> 01:12:02.873
<i>Education, veterans,</i>
<i>the economy...</i>

01:12:03.276 --> 01:12:05.608
<i>health care, the environment.</i>

01:12:06.679 --> 01:12:10.615
<i>I am working tirelessly.</i>
<i>I'm doing everything I can.</i>

01:12:10.983 --> 01:12:14.851
<i>Sincerely,</i>
<i>Earnest Bud Johnson."</i>

01:12:45.351 --> 01:12:45.874
Now!

01:12:48.087 --> 01:12:48.576
Now!

01:12:49.622 --> 01:12:50.919
Oh, my God! Don!

01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:52.723
The goose is down!

01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:55.427
How many fingers?

01:12:57.096 --> 01:12:59.894
America wants to know
what it's like to be Bud Johnson.

01:13:01.334 --> 01:13:02.460
It doesn't suck.

01:13:02.902 --> 01:13:03.732
Come on!

01:13:03.903 --> 01:13:06.997
I've heard you've received
marriage proposals in the mail, true?

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:11.700
Yeah, you can tell
that Miss September...

01:13:12.545 --> 01:13:16.174
that
I'm weighing my options.

01:13:16.382 --> 01:13:17.679
Hurry up, Bud!

01:13:17.884 --> 01:13:20.751
People Magazine named you
the Sexiest Man of the Year.

01:13:21.087 --> 01:13:24.181
Yeah? Well, what can I say?

01:13:25.491 --> 01:13:26.822
Guilty as charged!

01:13:28.761 --> 01:13:29.489
These people!

01:13:29.562 --> 01:13:32.793
Molly, what do you think of your Dad?
What do you think?

01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:49.109
Go ahead, go on. Stick your head up
with that little camera. You turd!

01:13:52.218 --> 01:13:54.413
Bud... Bud!

01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:56.788
- Freeze!
- Stop.

01:13:57.723 --> 01:13:58.348
Stop.

01:14:00.092 --> 01:14:00.615
Stop!

01:14:02.061 --> 01:14:06.521
Come on, Molly? It's just chocolate.
From the gun people.

01:14:07.099 --> 01:14:09.124
- I fixed you bacon and eggs.
- You did?

01:14:09.835 --> 01:14:10.551
That's nice!

01:14:10.569 --> 01:14:13.595
- I want you to look nice.
- What's the occasion?

01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:15.869
There's someone
I think you should talk to.

01:14:16.409 --> 01:14:16.898
Sit.

01:14:18.444 --> 01:14:22.141
She's different than all the others.
I think her heart's in the right place.

01:14:22.448 --> 01:14:25.281
I want you to try not to say
anything embarrassing, okay?

01:14:26.419 --> 01:14:28.148
- To who?
- Ms. Madison.

01:14:29.989 --> 01:14:32.184
- The TV woman?
- She's outside.

01:14:33.092 --> 01:14:35.322
- She's outside?
- Yes. In the kitchen.

01:14:36.495 --> 01:14:38.360
- She's in our kitchen?
- Yes.

01:14:39.832 --> 01:14:41.766
Just try and be normal.

01:14:43.369 --> 01:14:44.358
Do I smell?

01:14:45.137 --> 01:14:50.200
Then, give me the Old Spice.
God darn it! I was just having some fun!

01:14:56.949 --> 01:14:58.678
Molly, these eggs are amazing.

01:14:59.618 --> 01:15:01.745
Yes, they sure are.

01:15:02.688 --> 01:15:03.347
Thanks.

01:15:08.627 --> 01:15:09.457
Well...

01:15:10.963 --> 01:15:13.158
I like this new look on you.

01:15:13.432 --> 01:15:16.196
It's good, isn't it?
Professional.

01:15:16.535 --> 01:15:19.402
Yeah, its damn good.

01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:25.277
Anyway, Bud, I was thinking about
interviewing you over the next days.

01:15:25.745 --> 01:15:27.679
Get to know you
and your thoughts.

01:15:28.781 --> 01:15:32.080
Think people really care
about my thoughts?

01:15:32.184 --> 01:15:34.709
I really do considering
the choice you're about to make.

01:15:38.157 --> 01:15:39.613
Did you say
you went to Texico High?

01:15:39.625 --> 01:15:42.617
She did.
Only her name was Morales.

01:15:43.329 --> 01:15:44.125
Morales?

01:15:46.932 --> 01:15:52.768
You're kidding.
One of Bobby Morales little sisters?

01:15:52.838 --> 01:15:54.601
Yeah, that's me.

01:15:55.408 --> 01:15:56.670
Small world!

01:15:56.876 --> 01:16:00.312
Small town.
Then, Bud, are you ready?

01:16:01.213 --> 01:16:01.941
It's a good time?

01:16:03.282 --> 01:16:04.806
Yeah, go ahead, shoot.

01:16:19.165 --> 01:16:19.893
Thanks, Bud.

01:16:22.201 --> 01:16:25.068
Why don't we get started
with your opinion of gay marriage.

01:16:25.137 --> 01:16:28.300
Shit! Do we have to?

01:16:28.374 --> 01:16:31.741
- So, you're against it.
- I... no, I didn't say that.

01:16:32.078 --> 01:16:33.705
Then, what is your position?

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:38.517
I don't have a position on it. Actually,
I don't give a rat's ass about it.

01:16:39.218 --> 01:16:42.984
My daddy always said whatever a king
does in his castle is his business.

01:16:43.155 --> 01:16:47.216
I guess the same can go
for two queens.

01:16:52.898 --> 01:16:56.959
I'm President Boone, and I'd like
you to meet a few friends of mine.

01:16:57.603 --> 01:17:00.163
They're our doctors,
and our peace officers.

01:17:00.606 --> 01:17:03.905
They teach our children,
they serve nobly in our armed forces.

01:17:04.076 --> 01:17:06.260
For two long,
homosexual Americans...

01:17:06.278 --> 01:17:08.303
have been persecuted
by the country they love.

01:17:08.881 --> 01:17:14.114
This President, if re-elected,
will implement the open door initiative.

01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:19.455
Gay Americans alike will be able
to proudly step out of the closet...

01:17:19.592 --> 01:17:24.689
and on to the alter, to exchange the
sacred vows enjoyed by the rest of us.

01:17:25.297 --> 01:17:29.688
Bud, With your help,
this Republican administration...

01:17:29.702 --> 01:17:33.001
will say, I do.
To gay marriage.

01:17:34.006 --> 01:17:34.870
I do.

01:17:37.776 --> 01:17:38.470
I do.

01:17:39.111 --> 01:17:40.043
I do!

01:17:40.646 --> 01:17:41.738
I do.

01:17:41.881 --> 01:17:42.813
I do!

01:17:44.416 --> 01:17:45.610
I do!

01:17:50.856 --> 01:17:53.188
- I did it!
- That 'a way, baby!

01:17:54.793 --> 01:17:58.092
When we were kids, this was the only
thing to do on the weekends.

01:18:00.032 --> 01:18:00.930
Still is.

01:18:12.845 --> 01:18:14.039
Well done, Bud.

01:18:14.947 --> 01:18:15.504
See?

01:18:16.382 --> 01:18:17.940
Let's get to some real issues.

01:18:19.718 --> 01:18:20.343
Okay.

01:18:20.953 --> 01:18:24.616
Pro-life or pro-choice?
Where do you stand?

01:18:26.725 --> 01:18:27.953
Well...

01:18:30.029 --> 01:18:33.829
Life's pretty good.
Right about now.

01:18:34.233 --> 01:18:35.530
So, you're pro-life then?

01:18:39.071 --> 01:18:39.867
Who isn't?

01:18:42.675 --> 01:18:43.198
Artie.

01:18:46.345 --> 01:18:47.869
- Artie.
- What?

01:18:48.714 --> 01:18:53.071
I don't feel comfortable with this.
We're headed in the wrong direction.

01:18:53.085 --> 01:18:54.416
No, it's gonna be great.

01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:56.417
- Artie.
- And action! Action!

01:18:56.589 --> 01:18:57.954
And action, Donald!

01:19:02.828 --> 01:19:04.022
What is our future?

01:19:04.496 --> 01:19:06.589
I'll tell you what our future is.

01:19:07.132 --> 01:19:10.351
Children like these,
like your daughter, Bud.

01:19:10.369 --> 01:19:13.463
Happy, free, full of promise.

01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:18.806
But imagine a world
without all this joyous laughter.

01:19:19.578 --> 01:19:21.239
I'm talking about abortion.

01:19:21.814 --> 01:19:24.840
President Boone,
he claims he's pro-life.

01:19:24.850 --> 01:19:26.340
But yet under his leadership...

01:19:26.352 --> 01:19:30.550
no significant challenge has been
leveled against Roe versus Wade.

01:19:30.689 --> 01:19:33.544
With your help, Bud,
the Greenleaf administration...

01:19:33.559 --> 01:19:38.462
will lead a genuine effort to reverse
this inhumane court decision.

01:19:38.697 --> 01:19:43.293
So, join me and the Democrats
as we preserve all life...

01:19:44.403 --> 01:19:47.930
That's for filling
God's intelligent design.

01:19:48.407 --> 01:19:51.308
<i>I'm Donald Greenleaf</i>
<i>and I approve this message.</i>

01:19:51.577 --> 01:19:53.340
That don't seem right.

01:19:54.246 --> 01:19:57.044
He's only saying that because
you said you didn't like abortion.

01:19:57.216 --> 01:19:59.081
Yeah, but I didn't say that.

01:19:59.318 --> 01:20:01.218
You told that you were pro-life.

01:20:02.788 --> 01:20:03.413
So what?

01:20:03.489 --> 01:20:07.482
Pro-life means anti-abortion.
Roe versus Wade? Hello!

01:20:08.193 --> 01:20:09.353
This isn't working.

01:20:09.862 --> 01:20:12.660
I thought would help,
but it's just worse.

01:20:12.731 --> 01:20:14.665
You're the one
that wanted me to talk to her.

01:20:14.733 --> 01:20:17.861
I thought you might like her.
She's smart, and nice...

01:20:18.003 --> 01:20:20.096
not like the other women
you spend time with.

01:20:23.776 --> 01:20:25.471
Which women would those be, Molly?

01:20:25.944 --> 01:20:27.639
The ones that dance, Bud.

01:20:29.415 --> 01:20:31.246
Well, at least they got jobs.

01:20:33.819 --> 01:20:35.719
It's all getting
turned upside down now.

01:20:36.255 --> 01:20:38.883
What's all getting
turned upside down?

01:20:39.958 --> 01:20:41.687
You're ruining America!

01:20:42.428 --> 01:20:45.022
- I'm what?
- You're ruining EUA!

01:20:45.097 --> 01:20:47.122
- I'm ruining EUA?
- Yes!

01:20:47.132 --> 01:20:47.655
What?

01:20:49.101 --> 01:20:52.889
What I finally am
is having a little good luck...

01:20:52.905 --> 01:20:54.668
and you're giving me
shit about it!

01:20:58.644 --> 01:21:00.737
You know what all this means
for someone like me?

01:21:02.147 --> 01:21:04.809
I had dreams once.
Maybe it weren't this...

01:21:04.817 --> 01:21:07.877
but I was in the fifth grade,
so I had them.

01:21:09.254 --> 01:21:09.948
And now...

01:21:12.257 --> 01:21:15.590
I pretty much been headed on a road
for being a nobody and now that...

01:21:15.661 --> 01:21:19.893
I am a somebody, you can't stand
that I'm getting a little attention.

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:23.197
- A little?
- Yeah, a little.

01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:26.097
Maybe I'll tell the truth, Bud.

01:21:26.939 --> 01:21:28.099
- The truth?
- Yes.

01:21:29.875 --> 01:21:31.399
The truth about what?

01:21:32.044 --> 01:21:35.810
Maybe I'll tell everybody it was me
who tried to vote while you got drunk!

01:21:36.181 --> 01:21:38.445
I don't care if they
take me away from you.

01:21:38.517 --> 01:21:40.109
Molly... Hey, Molly!

01:21:42.388 --> 01:21:43.548
Leave me alone.

01:21:49.995 --> 01:21:51.895
- Fine.
- <i>Fine.</i>

01:21:54.433 --> 01:21:55.058
Fine.

01:22:47.486 --> 01:22:48.384
Could you sign it?

01:22:50.422 --> 01:22:51.582
Sure thing, Curly.

01:22:54.693 --> 01:22:59.153
Hey, Bud... did you give
the President's butt a kiss from us?

01:23:04.336 --> 01:23:05.564
You got something to say,
Walt?

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:11.874
It's not just me, Bud. No one
likes what you done to this town.

01:23:12.277 --> 01:23:14.177
What's gonna happen
after you vote?

01:23:14.513 --> 01:23:18.415
Everyone's gonna pack up and leave us
in the same shape as they found us.

01:23:18.584 --> 01:23:20.882
<i>Bud, you're on TV again!</i>

01:23:23.589 --> 01:23:26.683
Hey, Bud, you're on TV again.

01:23:26.692 --> 01:23:28.819
<i>People have to stop saying</i>
<i>Bud Johnson is good for democracy.</i>

01:23:29.194 --> 01:23:32.186
<i>He's made us the laughing</i>
<i>stock of the entire world.</i>

01:23:32.331 --> 01:23:35.983
<i>The news media follows him around</i>
<i>like a bunch of paparazzi, because...</i>

01:23:36.001 --> 01:23:38.333
<i>we're more concerned</i>
<i>with his fifteen minutes of fame...</i>

01:23:38.504 --> 01:23:40.768
<i>than we are with the choice</i>
<i>he's about to make.</i>

01:23:41.373 --> 01:23:43.364
<i>Is anybody really</i>
<i>listening to this guy?</i>

01:23:44.243 --> 01:23:48.179
<i>Wake up, America!</i>
<i>Bud Johnson, is a dumbass!</i>

01:24:06.465 --> 01:24:08.660
Your wife has just arrived,
Mr. Greenleaf.

01:24:08.734 --> 01:24:10.463
Thank God! Good.

01:24:11.470 --> 01:24:13.131
Please, don't upset him.

01:24:13.672 --> 01:24:16.402
When did you get in?
I missed you so much!

01:24:18.644 --> 01:24:20.942
You are letting this two
bit hack destroy you.

01:24:21.613 --> 01:24:24.901
You are everything that
the Republicans accused you of being.

01:24:24.917 --> 01:24:27.886
A spineless amateur.
Afraid to take a position.

01:24:27.953 --> 01:24:30.012
I am not afraid
to take a position.

01:24:31.456 --> 01:24:33.686
Okay, sometimes
I have second thoughts.

01:24:33.959 --> 01:24:35.950
But what thinking person doesn't?

01:24:36.061 --> 01:24:39.929
You used to stand for something.
Both of you.

01:24:40.666 --> 01:24:41.462
Let her go.

01:24:42.334 --> 01:24:44.029
What's happened to you, Art?

01:24:44.536 --> 01:24:45.833
I'm gonna win this time.

01:24:46.138 --> 01:24:48.698
You used to run campaigns
that meant something.

01:24:48.707 --> 01:24:53.770
They would have meant something
if the candidates I backed had won!

01:24:55.047 --> 01:24:59.381
You know what's like to be on the right
side of every issue on the theory stage?

01:24:59.785 --> 01:25:02.049
The hope that rocks
with every loss?

01:25:03.422 --> 01:25:06.289
Not this time. Never again.

01:25:19.371 --> 01:25:21.134
Back to work! Everybody!

01:25:27.012 --> 01:25:28.809
Look at that!

01:25:29.247 --> 01:25:32.114
You burnt the hot dog,
just a little bit.

01:25:32.618 --> 01:25:33.880
Just the way I like them!

01:25:36.421 --> 01:25:37.854
- Bud?
- Yes?

01:25:39.191 --> 01:25:43.127
I think we should ask
for a Presidential debate.

01:25:45.397 --> 01:25:49.151
Come on! Can't we just talk
about something else for one night?

01:25:49.167 --> 01:25:51.192
Just for a minute? Maybe?

01:25:53.271 --> 01:25:55.865
What did you just say to me?

01:25:57.042 --> 01:26:00.500
A Presidential debate.
Where you get to ask questions.

01:26:00.679 --> 01:26:03.045
Please. Just stop.

01:26:03.181 --> 01:26:05.547
It's important!
It could help you decide.

01:26:05.617 --> 01:26:07.175
Help me decide.

01:26:08.086 --> 01:26:09.542
Think about
what you're saying to me.

01:26:09.554 --> 01:26:12.785
I have! You should read
all this mail you've been getting.

01:26:13.258 --> 01:26:15.158
People are writing
to you for help.

01:26:15.627 --> 01:26:17.720
People are writing me letters.
So what?

01:26:18.230 --> 01:26:20.391
I can't help these people.

01:26:22.334 --> 01:26:23.562
You can speak for them.

01:26:27.939 --> 01:26:28.928
Will you do it for me?

01:26:35.147 --> 01:26:37.945
I'm doing this all
because of you!

01:26:42.954 --> 01:26:46.515
Confirmed, one Presidential debate
will occur this Wednesday night...

01:26:46.992 --> 01:26:50.120
at which Mr. Johnson will ask both
candidates a set of questions.

01:26:50.762 --> 01:26:53.094
The following day,
he'll cast his vote.

01:26:57.469 --> 01:26:59.460
Bud,
what will you ask at the debate?

01:27:00.539 --> 01:27:03.975
Truth is, I don't know yet,
but I'm...

01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:06.704
I'll figure it out.

01:27:12.951 --> 01:27:15.647
I hate debates.
Where they try-to trick you.

01:27:16.021 --> 01:27:17.989
I know, but you'll be fine.

01:27:18.824 --> 01:27:20.849
We have two days
to sew this thing up.

01:27:21.727 --> 01:27:23.456
I'm gonna need you
to meet with Bud again.

01:27:24.896 --> 01:27:27.797
And, offer him a little incentive.

01:27:29.534 --> 01:27:31.593
You want I give him
a bag of cash?

01:27:31.737 --> 01:27:33.602
No, he's got too much
attention on him for that.

01:27:34.139 --> 01:27:36.630
I was thinking
that maybe you'd offer him a job.

01:27:37.175 --> 01:27:40.201
Something with benefits.
If you know what I mean.

01:27:41.012 --> 01:27:42.707
Marty,
I've been meaning to talk to you.

01:27:44.850 --> 01:27:47.444
I'm not sure about our strategy
on this whole Bud thing.

01:27:47.886 --> 01:27:51.083
You've never questioned me before.
On anything.

01:27:51.790 --> 01:27:52.313
Ever.

01:27:52.891 --> 01:27:56.850
I know and I'm not saying
I won't do it. I just...

01:27:58.497 --> 01:27:59.964
I can't shake this feeling...

01:28:01.633 --> 01:28:04.500
The way we've been switching positions,
and now offering Bud...

01:28:06.471 --> 01:28:08.439
We're just doing
what we always do.

01:28:10.575 --> 01:28:11.166
That's all.

01:28:11.943 --> 01:28:15.174
Dancing the dance,
Courting the voters.

01:28:16.715 --> 01:28:19.616
Except this time,
it's only one voter.

01:28:21.453 --> 01:28:22.351
It's one guy.

01:28:23.522 --> 01:28:25.353
This is history,
Mr. President.

01:28:26.691 --> 01:28:28.283
It's never happened before.

01:28:28.827 --> 01:28:32.957
This is a moment the whole
world will remember. Forever.

01:28:35.467 --> 01:28:36.456
I understand.

01:28:43.308 --> 01:28:44.741
What are we about?

01:28:45.644 --> 01:28:46.201
Winning.

01:28:47.979 --> 01:28:51.415
Because if we don't win,
you can't do what you set out to do.

01:28:52.384 --> 01:28:54.318
And what you've done,
won't matter.

01:28:55.053 --> 01:28:58.113
If we don't win,
it's all over.

01:28:59.291 --> 01:29:00.349
And you're over.

01:29:01.893 --> 01:29:02.518
Bud!

01:29:05.964 --> 01:29:06.726
Bud!

01:29:10.769 --> 01:29:11.793
What time is it?

01:29:11.870 --> 01:29:14.964
Late. It's late.
You promised to take me in today.

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:18.806
Okay!
Just give me a few minutes.

01:29:20.145 --> 01:29:22.670
What's today?

01:29:24.716 --> 01:29:25.648
Forget it.

01:29:28.954 --> 01:29:30.751
Can you take me, please?

01:29:33.325 --> 01:29:35.293
Yeah Ye. Let's go.

01:29:40.565 --> 01:29:41.589
Oh, God!

01:29:43.935 --> 01:29:46.460
Hey, wait a minute, Molly.

01:29:54.446 --> 01:29:56.573
Molly! Molly!

01:29:56.648 --> 01:29:59.583
Mr. Johnson... Mr. Johnson!

01:30:00.652 --> 01:30:02.279
The President
would like a word with you.

01:30:02.921 --> 01:30:04.616
- The President?
- Yes, sir.

01:30:07.459 --> 01:30:08.756
Hey, get a life!

01:30:10.962 --> 01:30:14.090
I used to work at Gilmore
before I got laid off.

01:30:14.833 --> 01:30:17.324
Now, I find work wherever I can.

01:30:18.570 --> 01:30:20.868
Mow people's lawns,
fixing stuff.

01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:23.132
Hasn't been easy.

01:30:26.544 --> 01:30:27.135
Molly.

01:30:29.948 --> 01:30:34.282
I'd sure appreciate it if your Dad could
put in a good word for me at the plant.

01:30:35.654 --> 01:30:38.714
Thank you,
Michael and Mr. Everett for that...

01:30:40.025 --> 01:30:41.014
presentation.

01:30:42.327 --> 01:30:43.624
Who's next?

01:30:44.329 --> 01:30:44.920
Molly.

01:31:01.746 --> 01:31:04.078
I guess you all
probably know my dad.

01:31:06.918 --> 01:31:08.909
He really wanted
to be here today, but...

01:31:10.555 --> 01:31:12.648
he had so many
important things to do.

01:31:14.759 --> 01:31:16.351
He's doing his best, but...

01:31:17.662 --> 01:31:19.493
he can't be everywhere at once.

01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:24.393
Ever since
all this stuff happened...

01:31:27.172 --> 01:31:29.367
he's really been
under a lot of pressure.

01:31:32.844 --> 01:31:34.607
I just want you to know that...

01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:38.447
he takes
his responsibilities seriously...

01:31:40.185 --> 01:31:43.621
and that he really cares
about helping poor people...

01:31:44.255 --> 01:31:45.654
and sick people.

01:31:47.392 --> 01:31:49.883
And people
that can't help themselves.

01:31:55.266 --> 01:31:55.891
My...

01:31:59.971 --> 01:32:03.031
my dad wants to make
this country a better place.

01:32:18.323 --> 01:32:19.984
Do you think much
about your future?

01:32:22.227 --> 01:32:23.285
What future?

01:32:24.863 --> 01:32:25.761
I know what you mean.

01:32:26.464 --> 01:32:28.523
We all worry
about the sun down years.

01:32:29.367 --> 01:32:31.699
Sooner or later,
all this hoopla is gonna die down.

01:32:31.970 --> 01:32:33.392
They're gonna build me a library.

01:32:33.405 --> 01:32:35.100
and you're gonna be
just another face in the crowd.

01:32:37.742 --> 01:32:38.606
Can't wait.

01:32:40.512 --> 01:32:42.207
What you need
to think about is security.

01:32:43.381 --> 01:32:44.541
Now I've got a friend...

01:32:46.484 --> 01:32:50.648
who might have a job for you.
In the lobby business.

01:32:52.190 --> 01:32:54.818
Like opening doors for people?

01:32:55.894 --> 01:32:56.792
Very astute!

01:32:57.328 --> 01:33:00.286
Open doors to politicians.
And their checkbooks.

01:33:00.298 --> 01:33:03.529
People really like you, Bud.
They feel like you're one of them.

01:33:05.103 --> 01:33:06.934
I'm not quite following you,
Andy.

01:33:13.344 --> 01:33:15.710
Sometimes you gotta figure
out what you want in this life.

01:33:17.215 --> 01:33:19.410
Then you have to decide
how much it's worth to you.

01:33:20.618 --> 01:33:22.415
Because they're gonna
put it on your tombstone.

01:33:24.389 --> 01:33:25.356
It's your legacy.

01:33:26.958 --> 01:33:28.892
A measure
of what you left behind.

01:33:30.829 --> 01:33:31.591
Are we...

01:33:33.865 --> 01:33:35.628
are we still talking
about the job?

01:33:38.369 --> 01:33:39.768
The lobby business?

01:33:42.607 --> 01:33:45.576
Right. Forget that.

01:33:50.048 --> 01:33:51.174
It's not worth it.

01:34:00.558 --> 01:34:01.422
And thank you.

01:34:36.027 --> 01:34:36.721
Molly!

01:34:37.996 --> 01:34:40.021
You said that
if I ever wanted to talk, right?

01:34:43.501 --> 01:34:44.763
Here's some hot cocoa.

01:34:46.538 --> 01:34:48.529
Sorry.
All I had was skim milk.

01:34:48.773 --> 01:34:49.671
It's okay.

01:34:52.744 --> 01:34:53.711
What's going on?

01:34:55.346 --> 01:34:57.814
- It's all my fault.
- What's your fault?

01:34:58.149 --> 01:35:00.208
Bud was supposed
to meet me after school.

01:35:00.418 --> 01:35:03.319
He knew how important it was to me.
But he got drunk.

01:35:04.088 --> 01:35:07.546
He never even showed up.
I didn't know what else to do!

01:35:07.559 --> 01:35:09.754
Wait, Molly,
what are you saying?

01:35:11.696 --> 01:35:12.287
Molly?

01:35:13.865 --> 01:35:14.957
Aren't you gonna get that?

01:35:16.401 --> 01:35:20.701
Yeah, give me two seconds. Stay here.
I'm gonna get them off the phone.

01:35:30.949 --> 01:35:35.886
<i>Can call you back?</i>
<i>This isn't a good time. Yeah, I know.</i>

01:35:37.222 --> 01:35:38.780
<i>I know.</i>
<i>You already told me that.</i>

01:35:46.831 --> 01:35:48.799
<i>Look, can I call you back?</i>

01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:50.159
Molly?

01:35:51.803 --> 01:35:52.497
Molly!

01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:09.445
Are you okay?

01:36:11.022 --> 01:36:13.013
You think your dad
might be passed out tonight?

01:36:16.928 --> 01:36:18.987
<i>Then,</i>
<i>you're going to recast your vote.</i>

01:36:19.097 --> 01:36:21.725
<i>I guess it ain't</i>
<i>that much of a secret then, is it?</i>

01:36:25.470 --> 01:36:29.338
<i>If we are to be the exception to history,</i>
<i>then we must break the cycle.</i>

01:36:29.941 --> 01:36:31.772
<i>For those</i>
<i>who do not remember the past...</i>

01:36:33.778 --> 01:36:35.712
<i>Remind me again who's running?</i>

01:36:35.913 --> 01:36:38.279
<i>So, what you're saying is,</i>
<i>you're keeping...</i>

01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:41.981
<i>It's all my fault. Bud was supposed</i>
<i>to meet me after school.</i>

01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:45.351
<i>He knew how important this</i>
<i>was to me. But he got drunk.</i>

01:36:45.757 --> 01:36:49.090
<i>He didn't even show up.</i>
<i>I didn't know what else to do!</i>

01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:50.645
<i>Molly, what are you saying?</i>

01:36:50.662 --> 01:36:51.651
He didn't vote!

01:36:54.599 --> 01:36:56.191
What do you mean,
she's missing?

01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:57.656
I'm sorry, Mr. Johnson.
It's all my fault.

01:36:57.669 --> 01:36:58.988
For crying out loud, Lewis!

01:36:59.003 --> 01:37:02.962
You guys guard Presidents.

01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:05.641
She's smarter!

01:37:08.279 --> 01:37:09.177
Tell me about it!

01:37:21.092 --> 01:37:22.354
What is all this?

01:37:23.394 --> 01:37:24.884
She's been answering your mail.

01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:26.455
For what?

01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:32.727
She wanted people
to think that you cared.

01:37:34.305 --> 01:37:35.237
She told you that?

01:37:49.454 --> 01:37:52.582
Does have any friends
we should contact?

01:37:52.657 --> 01:37:53.487
I don't know.

01:37:58.730 --> 01:38:01.824
No, she's not the friend type.

01:38:03.034 --> 01:38:03.591
Jed.

01:38:04.802 --> 01:38:07.589
- Jed? Who's Jed?
- It's a boy she likes.

01:38:07.605 --> 01:38:09.800
She likes a boy?

01:38:10.108 --> 01:38:12.099
Jed Barkley.
He's in her class.

01:38:12.276 --> 01:38:14.676
He's a little shy,
but they're friends.

01:38:15.413 --> 01:38:19.372
- Is she told you that?
- Yes, sir.

01:38:25.022 --> 01:38:26.649
Do you have any idea
where she might be going?

01:38:33.197 --> 01:38:36.132
Yeah, I'm can guess
where she's going.

01:38:36.667 --> 01:38:38.464
Just tell us where,
we'll go pick her up, sir.

01:38:41.339 --> 01:38:45.002
She's my daughter.
I'll get her myself.

01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:12.533
This is it.

01:39:14.372 --> 01:39:15.600
Sure you wanna go in?

01:39:17.375 --> 01:39:18.967
Came this far, didn't we?

01:39:20.878 --> 01:39:23.938
I'll wait here awhile.
Just in case you want to go home.

01:39:29.287 --> 01:39:30.754
I never want to go home.

01:40:06.290 --> 01:40:06.779
Yes?

01:40:07.992 --> 01:40:09.619
I'm looking for Larissa Star.

01:40:11.429 --> 01:40:15.866
Well, she's gone.
She's moved out a long time ago.

01:40:22.006 --> 01:40:23.132
I think you're her.

01:40:31.949 --> 01:40:32.711
You Jed?

01:40:34.886 --> 01:40:37.446
- It's okay, is she in there?
- Yes, sir.

01:40:39.657 --> 01:40:40.589
Wait here.

01:40:49.367 --> 01:40:50.527
You're all grown up!

01:40:51.936 --> 01:40:53.130
You look like your dad.

01:40:54.805 --> 01:40:56.363
He says I look like you.

01:40:57.341 --> 01:41:01.141
Does he?
So, why did you come here?

01:41:02.446 --> 01:41:06.314
You wrote me a letter.
You said I could come live with you.

01:41:07.485 --> 01:41:09.919
That was a long time ago,
honey.

01:41:11.722 --> 01:41:13.485
Things have changed.

01:41:14.659 --> 01:41:17.856
I'm close to getting
a record deal.

01:41:18.930 --> 01:41:20.795
I did a gig
a couple of months ago.

01:41:21.098 --> 01:41:26.491
This guy wants to put me in touch
with this big time Nashville producer.

01:41:26.504 --> 01:41:28.131
So he's gonna call me.
I'm not gonna be ready.

01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:32.999
I gotta get ready. There's a lot
I gotta do, so I can't do this.

01:41:34.712 --> 01:41:37.909
I'm not well.
Can't you see that?

01:41:39.884 --> 01:41:41.715
I can take care of you, Mom.

01:41:41.953 --> 01:41:45.047
I don't want anybody to take care
of me. I don't want you here.

01:41:46.223 --> 01:41:47.155
Dad!

01:41:50.828 --> 01:41:52.489
Jesus Christ, Larissa!

01:41:53.297 --> 01:41:55.015
I don't want her
to see me like this.

01:41:55.032 --> 01:41:58.763
Molly, you gotta go outside, okay?
For me. You got out there and wait.

01:41:59.236 --> 01:42:02.034
- Dad!
- Just outside. Now!

01:42:11.182 --> 01:42:14.276
I heard you'd finally
gotten cleaned up.

01:42:14.652 --> 01:42:18.281
Who told you that? My God,
what is going on out there?

01:42:18.356 --> 01:42:19.106
I can't explain.

01:42:19.123 --> 01:42:23.355
What are you, famous now? You think
you can just come? I can't do this!

01:42:23.461 --> 01:42:26.624
- Wait...
- No! No! Come here.

01:42:26.897 --> 01:42:28.182
I'm not mad Larissa.

01:42:28.199 --> 01:42:29.393
I'm trying to tell you...

01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:33.588
I can't be a mom right now.
I can't. Stay back! I can't...

01:42:33.604 --> 01:42:37.597
be a mom right now.
I can't do it. I can't do it.

01:43:50.281 --> 01:43:51.714
Said no reporters, Lewis.

01:43:51.916 --> 01:43:53.269
I just want to talk to you.

01:43:53.284 --> 01:43:54.717
I don't have time, Kate.

01:43:55.219 --> 01:43:59.576
I'm moderating a Presidential debate
tomorrow night in front of a zillion.

01:43:59.590 --> 01:44:03.253
So as much as I'd love for you
to make an ass out of me again on TV...

01:44:03.427 --> 01:44:05.019
I kinda have
some preparing to do.

01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:11.834
I have to catch up
on the issues.

01:44:12.903 --> 01:44:14.268
Like all of them!

01:44:14.839 --> 01:44:15.362
Bud.

01:44:19.043 --> 01:44:20.943
I know what happened
election night.

01:44:22.146 --> 01:44:25.309
I'm running the story. I just want
to make sure I've got my facts right.

01:44:25.783 --> 01:44:29.651
The bartender claims you
left the Starline about 7:30.

01:44:30.287 --> 01:44:30.981
Is that correct?

01:44:31.756 --> 01:44:32.518
Yes, madam.

01:44:32.957 --> 01:44:36.154
Giving you plenty of time
to meet at the polling station...

01:44:37.027 --> 01:44:38.085
and cast your vote...

01:44:38.729 --> 01:44:39.286
right?

01:44:42.399 --> 01:44:45.232
I... guess so.

01:44:46.670 --> 01:44:47.728
Just making sure.

01:44:50.608 --> 01:44:53.634
I'm sorry.
I got something for you.

01:44:57.114 --> 01:44:59.082
Kinda forgot who I was
for a moment.

01:44:59.950 --> 01:45:00.939
Forgive me?

01:45:02.119 --> 01:45:02.915
That depends.

01:45:04.655 --> 01:45:07.215
Can you help me,
help him tonight?

01:45:10.461 --> 01:45:11.393
I'd love to.

01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:14.993
I work two jobs
just trying to make ends meet.

01:45:15.599 --> 01:45:17.157
Last year my son
was diagnosed with...

01:45:17.168 --> 01:45:22.572
Law makers renewed the primary programs
for low income HIV and AIDS patients.

01:45:22.907 --> 01:45:25.842
Named for Ryan White,
a young AIDS activist...

01:46:46.423 --> 01:46:47.583
<i>Good evening everyone.</i>

01:46:47.791 --> 01:46:51.124
<i>We come to you live</i>
<i>from a small American town...</i>

01:46:51.629 --> 01:46:54.962
<i>a town most of us had never</i>
<i>heard of just a few weeks ago.</i>

01:46:55.165 --> 01:46:57.292
A town you couldn't find
on the map...

01:46:57.301 --> 01:47:00.759
because Texico, New Mexico,
wasn't on the map.

01:47:01.472 --> 01:47:02.837
<i>But it's on the map now.</i>

01:47:02.907 --> 01:47:06.707
<i>The whole world has descended</i>
<i>on this town for an historic event.</i>

01:47:06.844 --> 01:47:09.745
<i>A political debate</i>
<i>unlike any other.</i>

01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:12.474
<i>Tomorrow morning,</i>
<i>Earnest Bud Johnson...</i>

01:47:12.549 --> 01:47:15.211
<i>will walk into a voting booth</i>
<i>and make a choice.</i>

01:47:15.753 --> 01:47:20.884
And his choice will affect
our lives for generations to come.

01:47:21.458 --> 01:47:25.121
the stakes could not be higher.
What do you expect?

01:47:25.195 --> 01:47:29.063
I wonder, Aaron, what the founding
fathers would make of all this.

01:47:29.266 --> 01:47:32.963
Would they be mortified,
or would they be jumping for joy?

01:47:33.103 --> 01:47:36.334
Something tells me
that somewhere right now...

01:47:36.507 --> 01:47:40.967
Franklin and Jefferson
are looking down and smiling.

01:47:41.378 --> 01:47:42.902
Smiling or laughing?

01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:45.071
I don't know if they're smiling.

01:47:45.082 --> 01:47:48.415
That's not exactly who they had in mind
for picking the President of the USA.

01:47:48.585 --> 01:47:53.079
We're sending someone out there who
really is, as far as, we can tell lost.

01:47:53.223 --> 01:47:56.386
Can he find himself suddenly,
tonight on this stage...

01:47:56.527 --> 01:47:58.893
Or is he going to look
like a rodeo clown down there?

01:47:59.029 --> 01:48:03.193
Tonight, the whole country is
watching and we watch with you.

01:48:04.201 --> 01:48:05.532
I'm gonna puke.

01:48:05.602 --> 01:48:07.661
Bud, look at me. Look at me.

01:48:08.305 --> 01:48:11.035
Just be yourself.
You're gonna be great.

01:48:14.979 --> 01:48:18.005
Hey, remember dad.
No cussing! Okay?

01:48:18.482 --> 01:48:20.006
- Fine.
- Fine.

01:48:20.985 --> 01:48:22.919
Mr. Johnson,
one minute, please.

01:48:26.223 --> 01:48:27.121
Good luck!

01:48:31.762 --> 01:48:32.922
<i>And so we begin.</i>

01:48:33.364 --> 01:48:36.231
<i>The crowd has settled down</i>
<i>and we go to the stage...</i>

01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:37.767
<i>for what promises to be...</i>

01:48:38.302 --> 01:48:42.500
<i>one of the most unique moments</i>
<i>in American political history.</i>

01:49:25.916 --> 01:49:28.476
Mr. President, Mr. Greenleaf...

01:49:29.653 --> 01:49:33.054
I'd like to thank you for your
hospitality. It's been real interesting.

01:49:33.924 --> 01:49:36.518
I've said a lot of thing
I didn't mean.

01:49:37.327 --> 01:49:38.817
and you both
made a lot of promises...

01:49:38.829 --> 01:49:40.456
you probably
won't be able to keep.

01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:52.866
To be honest, the last 10 days
have felt like a weird dream.

01:49:53.710 --> 01:49:55.871
What was once kinda funny,
isn't anymore.

01:49:57.748 --> 01:49:58.942
From what I've read, I've...

01:50:01.118 --> 01:50:03.518
well, I've scared
the hell out of America.

01:50:04.488 --> 01:50:07.889
I know that the world is watching,
maybe even laughing.

01:50:08.358 --> 01:50:10.451
people on my own TV,
are saying...

01:50:10.727 --> 01:50:13.958
that America, somehow,
deserves this moment.

01:50:15.933 --> 01:50:17.230
Guess that means me.

01:50:20.104 --> 01:50:24.063
I can't say that I've been much
of anything most of my life.

01:50:24.141 --> 01:50:26.871
It's sorta like somewhere
along the way...

01:50:27.878 --> 01:50:31.700
I checked out and it's not like
I had big dreams to begin with.

01:50:31.715 --> 01:50:34.741
but I had something once.

01:50:35.953 --> 01:50:40.811
I had something close
to faith or hope or whatever...

01:50:40.824 --> 01:50:43.258
whatever word you want
to use for how good life could be.

01:50:45.095 --> 01:50:49.555
But then, the years start moving
quicker and all of a sudden...

01:50:49.566 --> 01:50:51.500
what's going good
out there for every else...

01:50:53.203 --> 01:50:54.693
isn't going so good for you.

01:50:56.039 --> 01:50:58.906
But, tonight I feel...

01:51:00.744 --> 01:51:01.642
embarrassed.

01:51:05.082 --> 01:51:07.448
I've had my chances,
more than most.

01:51:08.752 --> 01:51:10.344
I've grown up
in a country where...

01:51:10.687 --> 01:51:14.885
if I decided to do more with my life
than just drift and drink...

01:51:15.392 --> 01:51:16.984
that I could be standing where...

01:51:18.595 --> 01:51:20.256
where maybe you stand tonight.

01:51:21.031 --> 01:51:24.933
Instead, I've taken freely
and I've given nothing.

01:51:26.170 --> 01:51:27.637
I'm ashamed in front of my...

01:51:29.540 --> 01:51:30.165
daughter.

01:51:33.477 --> 01:51:34.535
And my country.

01:51:36.647 --> 01:51:38.831
I've never served or sacrificed.

01:51:38.849 --> 01:51:43.286
The only heavy lifting
I've been asked is simple stuff, like...

01:51:43.620 --> 01:51:46.851
pay attention. Vote...

01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:51.050
For America has a...

01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:55.965
if America has a true enemy tonight,
I guess it's me.

01:51:58.535 --> 01:52:02.528
Tonight a below average man is going
to choose between two exceptional men.

01:52:03.507 --> 01:52:05.998
Tomorrow, one man's vote
is going to make a difference...

01:52:07.377 --> 01:52:09.208
'Cause tomorrow
we're gonna have a President.

01:52:09.513 --> 01:52:12.107
And not just someone
to fill a chair in Washington.

01:52:13.817 --> 01:52:16.342
We need someone
who's bigger than their speeches.

01:52:17.321 --> 01:52:20.984
The kind of President
we learned about in school.

01:52:23.126 --> 01:52:24.787
America needs a big thinker.

01:52:27.164 --> 01:52:29.223
You know, like a giant, really.

01:52:29.566 --> 01:52:32.729
Someone who has the good sense
to get in front of our problems.

01:52:33.203 --> 01:52:36.366
somebody who has the wisdom
to lead to us a place...

01:52:36.373 --> 01:52:38.739
where we're at peace
with ourselves and the world.

01:52:40.711 --> 01:52:43.976
And just for the record,
I want you both...

01:52:45.215 --> 01:52:48.013
I want you both to know
that I think a hella lot of you.

01:52:58.862 --> 01:53:03.299
Tonight, I am going to speak
for people I have never met...

01:53:06.436 --> 01:53:09.337
whose letters touched me
in a way I didn't think was possible.

01:53:12.576 --> 01:53:14.544
My first question comes from...

01:53:14.845 --> 01:53:16.972
Peter Manthis,
in Henderson, Kentucky.

01:53:17.381 --> 01:53:18.575
"Dear Mr. Johnson...

01:53:18.782 --> 01:53:21.444
my wife and I
have three little girls.

01:53:21.518 --> 01:53:25.079
We both work two jobs
just trying to make ends meet.

01:53:26.723 --> 01:53:29.317
And some weeks,
we don't make it."

01:53:30.027 --> 01:53:32.882
"When you work hard and you still
can't take care of your family...

01:53:32.896 --> 01:53:36.525
you start to question yourself
as a provider, as a man.

01:53:37.668 --> 01:53:40.865
I know I am one. I fought
for my country and I'm proud of it.

01:53:42.572 --> 01:53:46.941
But it scares me to think about what
would happen if one of my kids got sick.

01:53:48.578 --> 01:53:53.015
"Can you ask the candidates,
if we are richest country in the world...

01:53:54.518 --> 01:53:57.510
how come some many of us can
barely afford to live here?"

01:54:00.624 --> 01:54:03.115
I'd like to take that one first,
if I might, Mr. Greenleaf.

01:54:04.194 --> 01:54:05.491
Answer, Mr. President.

01:54:07.731 --> 01:54:11.633
Bud, I'd first like to say, how much
I appreciate your thoughtfulness.

01:55:11.634 --> 01:55:12.634
