WEBVTT

00:01.708 --> 00:02.667
TIME OF WRAP,
PLEASE, DAWSON?

00:02.667 --> 00:05.583
12:07 A.M.

00:05.583 --> 00:07.417
SO THAT'S WHAT,
MONDAY?

00:07.417 --> 00:10.250
12:07 A.M.
SOMETIME IN JANUARY,

00:10.250 --> 00:14.542
AND WE HAVE DONE IT, PEOPLE.
WE HAVE FINISHED
PRINCIPAL PHOTOGRAPHY.

00:14.542 --> 00:17.083
(ALL CHEERING)

00:20.166 --> 00:23.083
SO, ALTHOUGH IT'S RATHER
OUT OF CHARACTER FOR ME,

00:23.083 --> 00:24.792
I'D LIKE
TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY

00:24.792 --> 00:27.166
TO THANK ALL OF YOU
FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK

00:27.166 --> 00:29.000
AND TO PROPOSE A TOAST.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.625
TO US,

00:30.625 --> 00:32.834
AND OUR MOVIE. CHEERS.

00:32.834 --> 00:37.166
(ALL CHEER)

00:45.166 --> 00:48.500
IT'S STRANGE, ISN'T IT,
THAT ALL THIS WILL
JUST BE GONE TOMORROW,

00:48.500 --> 00:49.875
LIKE IT NEVER
EVEN EXISTED?

00:52.458 --> 00:54.375
HEY.

00:54.375 --> 00:56.333
NICE SPEECH,
BY THE WAY.

00:56.333 --> 00:58.917
AND DON'T EVEN BOTHER
TRYING TO PRETEND
THAT IT WAS TODD'S IDEA,

00:58.917 --> 01:01.291
BECAUSE THAT PUPPY
HAD YOU WRITTEN ALL OVER IT.

01:01.291 --> 01:04.917
SINCERITY, WARMTH,
AND A HINT OF SOMETHING,
I DON'T KNOW.

01:04.917 --> 01:07.708
BITTERSWEET?
OR WAS IT JUST BITTER?

01:09.542 --> 01:11.375
WELL, THAT'S
WHAT WRAP PARTIES
ARE ALL ABOUT,

01:11.375 --> 01:12.250
AREN'T THEY?
I KNOW YOU'RE

01:12.250 --> 01:14.542
MORE EXPERIENCED
AT THEM THAN I AM.

01:14.542 --> 01:18.375
SO, ARE YOU HEADING BACK
TO L.A. TOMORROW, OR WHAT?

01:18.375 --> 01:20.834
YEAH, WITH TODD.
YOU?

01:20.834 --> 01:21.875
AFTERNOON FLIGHT.

01:21.875 --> 01:24.000
MAX GOT ME
A SMALL PART

01:24.000 --> 01:25.417
IN THAT SPIELBERG FILM
HE'S DOING.

01:25.417 --> 01:28.625
YOU KNOW, IT'S,
LIKE, 2 DAYS WORK
OR WHATEVER, BUT WHO KNOWS?

01:28.625 --> 01:30.208
MAYBE IT'LL LEAD
TO BIGGER THINGS.

01:31.959 --> 01:34.083
KNOWING YOU, NATASHA,
I'M CERTAIN IT WILL.

01:34.083 --> 01:36.458
IS THAT
A LITTLE ATTITUDE?

01:36.458 --> 01:40.375
A BREAK IN THE
OH, SO PROFESSIONAL
ON-SET DEMEANOR

01:40.375 --> 01:42.041
YOU'VE BEEN CULTIVATING
SINCE THE NEW YEAR?

01:42.041 --> 01:43.250
NOT EVERYONE
ON THE PLANET

01:43.250 --> 01:44.250
IS ACTING EVERY
SECOND OF THEIR
LIVES, YOU KNOW.

01:44.250 --> 01:50.750
NO, MAYBE NOT,
BUT IN HOLLYWOOD, THEY ARE.

01:50.750 --> 01:51.875
SO, GOOD-BYE, DAWSON.

01:51.875 --> 01:55.166
GOOD LUCK OUT THERE.

01:55.166 --> 01:58.291
I HAVE A FUNNY FEELING
ABOUT YOU.

01:58.291 --> 02:00.333
WHAT'S THAT?

02:00.333 --> 02:02.083
THAT YOU'RE
GONNA NEED IT.

02:02.542 --> 02:04.291
RIGHT.

02:59.375 --> 03:01.375
HI. IT'S ME.

03:01.375 --> 03:05.583
UM, I'M BACK AT SCHOOL.
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN BACK.

03:05.583 --> 03:07.667
I WASN'T GOING TO CALL
YOU, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
YOU HAVEN'T CALLED ME,

03:07.667 --> 03:09.125
AND I DO HAVE
SOMETHING CALLED PRIDE,

03:09.125 --> 03:11.500
THOUGH APPARENTLY
NOT ENOUGH, BECAUSE,
YOU WIN, OK?

03:11.500 --> 03:13.667
I'M BEING THE TYPICAL
GIRL AND CALLING YOU.

03:13.667 --> 03:14.875
AND IN RETROSPECT,
YOU KNOW,

03:14.875 --> 03:16.208
I REALLY DON'T THINK
CHRISTMAS WENT THAT BADLY,

03:16.208 --> 03:17.625
IF YOU GRADE IT
ON ONE OF THOSE

03:17.625 --> 03:20.500
WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA
WOOLF  TYPE SCALES.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.250
BUT, UM, ANYWAY,
YOU'RE PROBABLY OUT
POUNDING THE PAVEMENTS

03:23.250 --> 03:26.125
AND STUFF, SO JUST
GIVE ME A CALL

03:26.125 --> 03:28.667
WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE
OR WHENEVER.

03:28.667 --> 03:31.375
OK. BYE.

03:39.291 --> 03:40.166
ARE YOU KIDDING?

03:40.166 --> 03:41.208
SO, HOW DID
YOU GET IN HERE?

03:41.208 --> 03:43.208
YOU DON'T EVEN LOOK
A DAY OVER 16.

03:43.208 --> 03:44.041
PEOPLE ALWAYS
THINK I'M 16,

03:44.041 --> 03:48.917
BUT, DUH, I AM
TOTALLY 18.

03:50.333 --> 03:52.000
DON'T YOU MEAN 15?
NICE TALKING TO YOU GUYS.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.708
OW! MANIAC.

03:54.708 --> 03:56.208
HARLEY, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

03:56.208 --> 03:58.125
I THOUGHT
CHRISTMAS VACATION
WAS LONG OVER

03:58.125 --> 03:59.000
FOR THE BRITNEY
AND CHRISTINA SET.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.250
I'M NOT ON VACATION.

04:01.250 --> 04:03.125
UNFORTUNATELY,
I LIVE HERE NOW.

04:03.125 --> 04:06.083
SO, WHERE'S EDDIE?
HE'S THE ONLY NICE PERSON
I KNOW IN BOSTON,

04:06.083 --> 04:08.041
AND HE STILL OWES ME
A ROOT-BEER FLOAT.

04:08.041 --> 04:10.000
WAIT A SECOND.
YOU LIVE HERE
FULL-TIME NOW?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.750
AS IN FULL-TIME
WITH YOUR FATHER?

04:12.750 --> 04:16.208
YES. WHY ARE
YOU SMILING?

04:16.208 --> 04:19.583
SORRY. IT'S JUST
YOUR FATHER'S
SUCH A GREAT GUY,

04:19.583 --> 04:22.000
HE DESERVES TO HAVE
SUCH A WELL-BEHAVED,
GOOD-NATURED,

04:22.000 --> 04:25.208
TEENAGE GIRL LIVING
WITH HIM FULL-TIME.

04:25.208 --> 04:26.417
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

04:26.417 --> 04:27.959
WHY AREN'T YOU
IN SCHOOL RIGHT NOW?

04:27.959 --> 04:30.333
IF I TELL YOU, WILL YOU
TELL ME WHERE EDDIE IS?

04:30.333 --> 04:32.291
OUT WITH IT.

04:32.291 --> 04:35.708
OK, FINE. I WAS
ON A FIELD TRIP, AND I DITCHED.

04:35.708 --> 04:37.917
YOU WOULD, TOO, IF YOUR
ENTIRE LIFE WAS RUINED

04:37.917 --> 04:40.375
BY YOUR MOTHER'S SUDDEN NEED
TO DO RESEARCH IN BANGLADESH.

04:42.125 --> 04:43.708
HARLEY, YOUR LIFE
ISN'T RUINED.

04:43.708 --> 04:44.458
YOU'RE JUST BEING
MELODRAMATIC.

04:44.458 --> 04:46.750
RIGHT. LIKE
YOU WOULD KNOW

04:46.750 --> 04:48.333
WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO HAVE YOUR LIFE RUINED?

04:49.959 --> 04:51.250
LOOK, HE'S
NOT HERE, OK?

04:51.250 --> 04:53.291
EDDIE.
AND TO BE HONEST,

04:53.291 --> 04:56.291
I DON'T EXACTLY
KNOW WHERE HE IS.

04:56.291 --> 04:58.291
MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU MESSED IT UP WITH HIM.

04:58.291 --> 05:02.208
HE WAS AMAZING.
HE WAS BEYOND AMAZING.

05:02.208 --> 05:03.542
LOOK, I'LL GO GET YOU
A ROOT-BEER FLOAT,

05:03.542 --> 05:05.625
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO GO
BACK TO SCHOOL.

05:05.625 --> 05:07.333
I DON'T CARE
HOW MISERABLE IT IS.

05:07.333 --> 05:10.375
IT'S JUST LIFE.
LIFE IS MISERABLE.

05:13.250 --> 05:16.208
HEY, GUYS. HEY, STAY WITH
YOUR PARTNERS, GUYS.

05:16.208 --> 05:17.333
STAY WITH
YOUR PARTNERS.

05:17.333 --> 05:19.291
LET'S GO. OK.

05:37.417 --> 05:40.333
SHOULDN'T YOU BE
DOING THAT IN A MUSEUM?

05:40.333 --> 05:42.542
OH, BLOODY HELL.

05:42.542 --> 05:44.333
SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN
TO SCARE YOU.

05:44.333 --> 05:45.875
WELL, YOU DID.

05:45.875 --> 05:49.875
IT'S NOT THE SORT
OF PLACE YOU EXPECT
TO FIND STOCKBROKERS.

05:49.875 --> 05:52.333
GIVE ME A BREAK, WOULD YOU?
I'M ON MY LUNCH HOUR.

05:52.333 --> 05:54.041
MIND IF I SIT?

05:54.041 --> 05:56.834
NO, GO AHEAD,
BUT DON'T SIT TOO CLOSE.

05:56.834 --> 05:58.166
I KNOW,
THAT OVERWHELMING
PHYSICAL ATTRACTION'S

05:58.166 --> 05:59.792
GETTING TO YA, HUH?

05:59.792 --> 06:00.333
NO, THAT'S NOT IT,
EXACTLY.

06:00.333 --> 06:02.041
REALLY?
NO.

06:02.041 --> 06:03.125
I JUST DON'T
WANT ANYONE TO KNOW

06:03.125 --> 06:04.625
THAT, UH,
YOU'RE WITH ME.

06:04.625 --> 06:06.083
THANKS.

06:06.083 --> 06:08.125
(LAUGHS) WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, ANYWAY?

06:08.125 --> 06:10.333
I WORK NEAR HERE.
I COME HERE
ALL THE TIME.

06:10.333 --> 06:11.750
THE BETTER QUESTION
IS WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

06:11.750 --> 06:14.208
I'M JUST KILLING TIME
TILL 1:00.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.417
WHAT HAPPENS AT 1:00?

06:16.417 --> 06:18.208
WELL,
YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS,

06:18.208 --> 06:19.417
SINCE YOU COME HERE
ALL THE TIME.

06:19.417 --> 06:23.041
ON MY LUNCH HOUR,
WHICH HAPPENS AT NOON.

06:23.041 --> 06:24.708
SO I COME HERE,
I WALK AROUND,

06:24.708 --> 06:25.917
HAVE A SLICE
OF PIZZA,

06:25.917 --> 06:27.250
AND I'M OUT
THE DOOR BY 12:45.

06:27.250 --> 06:29.375
AH, BACK TO WORK.

06:29.375 --> 06:31.208
YEAH, THAT'S WHY THEY
CALL IT THE LUNCH HOUR.

06:31.208 --> 06:33.291
'CAUSE, YOU SEE, IF WAS
TO STAY TILL AFTER 1:00,

06:33.291 --> 06:34.750
BY THE TIME
I GOT BACK TO WORK,

06:34.750 --> 06:36.250
IT'D BE THE LUNCH
HOUR AND A HALF,

06:36.250 --> 06:37.750
AND WE JUST CAN'T
HAVE THAT, NOW, CAN WE?

06:37.750 --> 06:39.542
THEN I DON'T
WANT TO KEEP YOU.

06:39.542 --> 06:41.041
EXCUSE ME?

06:42.375 --> 06:42.708
IT'S 12:46.

06:44.917 --> 06:48.792
OH.

06:48.792 --> 06:50.333
RIGHT.

06:52.625 --> 06:53.875
RIGHT. THEN I'LL...

06:53.875 --> 06:55.333
I'LL JUST SEE YOU
BACK HOME.

06:59.875 --> 07:04.291
WELL, OF COURSE IT SUCKS.
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT LIFE.

07:04.291 --> 07:08.542
AND WHAT IS IT REALLY,
OTHER THAN AN ENDLESS
SERIES OF MIND-NUMBING DAYS,

07:08.542 --> 07:09.166
ONE ON TOP OF ANOTHER.

07:09.166 --> 07:12.458
ALIENATION, DESPAIR--

07:12.458 --> 07:14.917
THESE ARE THE NATURAL
BY-PRODUCTS OF LIVING
IN A MECHANIZED SOCIETY--

07:14.917 --> 07:15.917
OK, STOP.

07:15.917 --> 07:17.917
STOP?

07:17.917 --> 07:19.708
YEAH. UM...

07:19.708 --> 07:21.166
A LOT OF PEOPLE GET DEPRESSED
THIS TIME OF YEAR.

07:21.166 --> 07:25.208
I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE CALLING IN HOPING
TO TALK TO KIERKEGAARD.

07:26.583 --> 07:28.625
BUT YOU SAID HE WAS
A PHILOSOPHY MAJOR.

07:30.375 --> 07:33.208
WHATEVER. LOOK, I JUST,
I DON'T WANNA FIGHT, OK?

07:33.208 --> 07:35.000
I GET ANNOYED,
AND YOU GET DEFENSIVE.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.458
LET'S JUST MOVE ON
TO THE NEXT ONE.

07:36.458 --> 07:40.291
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S NOT. I QUIT.

07:40.291 --> 07:42.708
YOU CAN'T QUIT.
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
STARTED YET.

07:42.708 --> 07:44.291
IT'S YOUR FIRST DAY OF TRAINING.
IT'S YOUR FIRST HOUR.

07:44.291 --> 07:47.291
YEAH, WELL, IF THE
TRAINING CONSISTS OF
SITTING HERE FOR A WEEK

07:47.291 --> 07:48.458
AND LISTENING TO YOU
ACT SUPERIOR TO ME--

07:48.458 --> 07:50.125
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR 2 YEARS.

07:50.125 --> 07:53.458
GREAT. WELL,
MAYBE YOUR EXPERTISE
WILL COME IN HANDY

07:53.458 --> 07:55.291
WHEN WE GET TO
A HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION

07:55.291 --> 07:57.750
INVOLVING CASUAL SEX AND
A COUPLE OF BLOND GIRLS.

08:00.500 --> 08:01.291
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT ONE THING.

08:01.291 --> 08:03.708
LET'S CALL IT A DAY.

08:03.708 --> 08:07.083
SO, COME BACK TOMORROW
OR DON'T COME BACK,

08:07.083 --> 08:11.500
BUT WHATEVER YOU DECIDE,
YOU SHOULD MAKE IT
ABOUT YOU, NOT ME.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.250
David: OK.
THIS'LL DO NICE. THANKS.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.792
DAMN.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.917
WHAT?

08:25.917 --> 08:28.125
OH, THERE'S
NO GOOD MAGAZINES
TO READ.

08:29.834 --> 08:32.958
THAT'S IT? I MEAN,
YOU'RE NOT AT ALL
NERVOUS ABOUT THIS?

08:32.958 --> 08:34.332
OH, IT'S
A PIECE OF CAKE.

08:34.332 --> 08:36.000
I'VE DONE IT, LIKE,
A MILLION TIMES.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.500
A MILLION?

08:37.500 --> 08:38.958
GIVE OR TAKE.

08:38.958 --> 08:40.750
I'D BE
A PRETTY HYPOCRITICAL
PEER COUNSELOR

08:40.750 --> 08:42.125
IF I DIDN'T PRACTICE
WHAT I PREACHED.

08:42.125 --> 08:45.542
RIGHT.

08:45.542 --> 08:49.000
SERIOUSLY,
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.041
AND THE MOST
EMBARRASSING PART
IS WHEN THEY ASK

08:51.041 --> 08:52.250
WHAT KIND
OF HIGH-RISK BEHAVIOR

08:52.250 --> 08:53.917
YOU'VE ENGAGED IN
THE PAST 3 TO 6 MONTHS.

08:53.917 --> 08:55.041
THE ONLY THING
I CAN COME UP WITH

08:55.041 --> 08:57.792
IS EATING CARBS
AFTER 9 P.M.
AND JAYWALKING.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.125
JACK McPHEE?

09:03.125 --> 09:04.792
IT'S FINE.

09:14.542 --> 09:17.792
BLINDINGLY DULL.
ACHINGLY DULL.

09:17.792 --> 09:20.208
MIND-NUMBINGLY DULL.

09:21.792 --> 09:25.250
I SEE, AND WHAT DO THESE
LITTLE CARDS PROVE EXACTLY?

09:25.250 --> 09:27.667
OTHER THAN THE FACT
YOU'VE BEEN PREVIEWING
THE BLOODY THING ALL ALONG?

09:27.667 --> 09:30.125
THEY PROVE THAT
WE'RE NOT THROUGH SHOOTING.
THAT'S WHAT THEY PROVE.

09:30.125 --> 09:32.041
RESHOOTS?

09:32.041 --> 09:35.125
ABSOLUTELY. MORE SEX.
MORE VIOLENCE.

09:35.125 --> 09:37.333
MAYBE A LITTLE TWIST
IN THE PLOT

09:37.333 --> 09:39.750
THAT'S NOT PREDICTABLE
FROM THE VERY FIRST FRAME.

09:39.750 --> 09:42.291
I MEAN,
OBVIOUSLY, THE GOAL HERE

09:42.291 --> 09:44.417
IS TO TRY TO MAKE
THIS DAMN THING WATCHABLE.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.917
I SEE. SO, YOU'RE CALLING
MY MOVIE UNWATCHABLE?

09:47.917 --> 09:50.500
I DON'T HAVE TO.
THEY DID.

09:50.500 --> 09:51.625
YOU WANT ME
TO READ SOME MORE?

09:51.625 --> 09:53.917
NO, THAT WON'T BE
NECESSARY, THANK YOU.

09:57.041 --> 09:58.208
ANYONE GOT A LIGHT?

09:59.291 --> 10:00.708
IF I'M GONNA SIT HERE
AND TAKE ARTISTIC ADVICE

10:00.708 --> 10:03.750
FROM EVERY TOM, DICK,
AND HARRY IN TARZANA

10:03.750 --> 10:05.750
THAT DIDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING BETTER
TO DO LAST WEDNESDAY NIGHT,

10:05.750 --> 10:08.417
THEN I'M GONNA
BLOODY WELL NEED
SOME NICOTINE, ALL RIGHT?

10:08.417 --> 10:10.834
LIGHT, PLEASE, DAWSON.

10:12.667 --> 10:15.625
UM, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA GO GET ONE.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.291
COME ON.
PICK UP THE PHONE.

10:27.291 --> 10:30.959
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

10:30.959 --> 10:33.166
REACH INTO
THE POCKET AND
PICK UP THE PHONE.

10:39.041 --> 10:40.917
HELLO?

10:40.917 --> 10:42.375
SHUT UP BEFORE
YOU MAKE THIS ANY WORSE

10:42.375 --> 10:42.792
AND GET OUT HERE.

10:44.291 --> 10:47.125
HELLO? HELLO?

10:50.375 --> 10:51.375
EXCUSE ME.

10:51.375 --> 10:54.166
WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!

10:54.166 --> 10:55.458
WHERE DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE GOING?

10:55.458 --> 10:57.333
OH, I'M SORRY.
DON'T MEAN
TO BE RUDE.

10:57.333 --> 10:58.667
THERE'S
ANOTHER IDIOT
OUT IN THE HALL

10:58.667 --> 11:00.083
THAT REQUIRES
MY ATTENTION.

11:04.875 --> 11:05.625
AND JUST WHAT
IN THE BLOODY HELL

11:05.625 --> 11:07.417
DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?!

11:07.417 --> 11:08.792
WHAT DO I THINK--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:08.792 --> 11:09.792
YOU'RE DIGGING YOURSELF
A HOLE IN THERE

11:09.792 --> 11:11.041
BIGGER THAN
THE LA BREA TAR PITS.

11:11.041 --> 11:12.875
DID IT EVER OCCUR
TO YOU THAT MIGHT
BE MY INTENTION?

11:12.875 --> 11:14.708
YOU NEVER
WANNA WORK AGAIN?

11:14.708 --> 11:15.875
WE'RE IN CHARGE HERE.
WE MAKE THE DECISIONS.

11:15.875 --> 11:18.041
WHICH IS ALL WELL AND GOOD
EXCEPT FOR ONE THING.

11:18.041 --> 11:19.250
WHAT?

11:19.250 --> 11:21.417
IT'S THEIR MONEY.

11:21.417 --> 11:22.917
LOOK, YOU BROUGHT ME HERE
FOR MY ABILITY

11:22.917 --> 11:23.834
TO STAY CALM
IN A CRISIS, RIGHT?

11:23.834 --> 11:26.500
WELL, THIS IS IT.
THIS IS A CRISIS

11:26.500 --> 11:27.458
'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T
GO BACK IN THERE

11:27.458 --> 11:28.542
AND ACT HAPPY
ABOUT THESE RESHOOTS,

11:28.542 --> 11:29.917
THEY'RE GONNA GET
SOMEBODY ELSE TO DO IT,

11:29.917 --> 11:30.834
SOMEBODY WHO CAN
RUIN THIS MOVIE.

11:30.834 --> 11:33.000
AND WOULD THAT BE
SUCH A TRAGEDY?

11:33.000 --> 11:35.166
YES. LOOK,
MAYBE I'M NAIVE

11:35.166 --> 11:38.250
THINKING THAT
THIS WHOLE SYSTEM,
THIS WHOLE PROCESS,

11:38.250 --> 11:40.708
CAN ONLY PRODUCE
SOMETHING THAT'S
A NOTCH ABOVE MEDIOCRE,

11:40.708 --> 11:43.583
BUT I WANT THIS THING
TO BE GOOD.

11:43.583 --> 11:45.417
I WANT IT TO BE AS GOOD
AS IT POSSIBLY CAN BE,

11:45.417 --> 11:46.291
AND I DON'T THINK
I WOULD'VE STUCK IT OUT

11:46.291 --> 11:47.166
WORKING FOR YOU
THIS WHOLE TIME

11:47.166 --> 11:49.417
IF YOU DIDN'T
WANT THE SAME THING.

11:52.917 --> 11:55.125
SO, WE FIGURE
3 DAYS OF RESHOOTS

11:55.125 --> 11:58.208
ON A SOUNDSTAGE
HERE IN L.A.,
VERY MINIMAL BUDGET.

11:58.208 --> 12:02.166
THE WHOLE IDEA HERE
IS TO, UH, COME UP
WITH A NEW ENDING.

12:02.166 --> 12:03.458
SOMETHING
THAT'S WATCHABLE.

12:03.458 --> 12:06.917
OR AT THE VERY LEAST,
SOMETHING THAT MAKES SENSE.

12:06.917 --> 12:10.041
NOW, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THAT'S GOING TO BE,

12:10.041 --> 12:11.875
BUT HEATHER HERE
SEEMS FAIRLY CONFIDENT

12:11.875 --> 12:15.208
THAT GIVEN ENOUGH
NICOTINE, ALCOHOL, CAFFEINE,

12:15.208 --> 12:18.417
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE
TO PULL SOMETHING OFF.

12:18.417 --> 12:20.041
WELL, THAT'S, UH,
VERY CHARITABLE OF HER.

12:20.041 --> 12:21.625
THANK YOU, SWEETHEART.

12:21.625 --> 12:24.083
MM-HMM. ALL RIGHT, TODD,
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?

12:24.083 --> 12:25.792
WELL, I CAN SEE
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM.

12:25.792 --> 12:29.166
I CAN. I CAN SEE
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM.

12:29.166 --> 12:34.750
I CAN SEE HOW YOU
AND OTHER PEOPLE
LIKE YOURSELF,

12:34.750 --> 12:37.875
PEOPLE OF
LESSER INTELLIGENCE,

12:37.875 --> 12:39.875
MIGHT BE A BIT CONFUSED
BY MY MOVIE.

12:39.875 --> 12:41.417
AND I CAN SEE
HOW YOU ACTUALLY

12:41.417 --> 12:43.917
DON'T HAVE ANY
NEW IDEAS OF YOUR OWN
ON HOW TO IMPROVE IT,

12:43.917 --> 12:46.917
BECAUSE, AFTER ALL,
YOU'RE NOT REALLY

12:46.917 --> 12:49.959
IN THE BUSINESS OF
HAVING IDEAS, ARE YOU?

12:49.959 --> 12:53.542
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU THINK YOU ARE.

12:53.542 --> 12:55.166
WELL, YOU'RE NOT.

12:55.166 --> 12:57.083
YOU'RE IN THE BUSINESS
OF CRITICIZING
OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS.

12:57.083 --> 13:00.834
WHICH IS WHY, AFTER MUCH
CAREFUL CONSIDERATION,

13:00.834 --> 13:02.917
I'LL BE THROWING
YOUR MOST GENEROUS OFFER

13:02.917 --> 13:05.750
BACK IN YOUR FACE
AND LEAVING.

13:05.750 --> 13:08.083
GOOD-BYE,
AND GOOD LUCK WITH ALL
YOUR FUTURE ENDEAVORS.

13:15.750 --> 13:18.667
WELL, THEN,
SINCE NOBODY SEEMS UP TO
THE RHETORICAL CHALLENGE

13:18.667 --> 13:20.291
OF CONVINCING ME
THAT NORMAN MAILER WAS WRONG

13:20.291 --> 13:22.333
WHEN HE DISMISSED
ALL FEMALE WRITERS
AS UNREADABLE,

13:23.834 --> 13:25.291
THAT'S IT FOR WEDNESDAY.

13:41.875 --> 13:45.375
OH. THAT CAN'T
BE JOEY POTTER.

13:45.375 --> 13:46.750
GUESS ONE "D"
ISN'T ENOUGH

13:46.750 --> 13:48.625
TO GET ANYONE THROWN OUT
OF WORTHINGTON ANYMORE.

13:48.625 --> 13:50.291
SWEET, REALLY,

13:50.291 --> 13:51.500
YOUR OVERWHELMING
CONCERN FOR MY FUTURE,

13:51.500 --> 13:53.750
BUT THAT'S
ACTUALLY NOT WHY
I'M SUBJECTING MYSELF

13:53.750 --> 13:55.208
TO YOUR TOXIC
PERSONALITY.

13:55.208 --> 13:57.875
GREAT. AND I'LL SKIP AHEAD
TO THE PART WHERE I INFORM YOU

13:57.875 --> 13:59.375
THAT NO, NO MATTER
HOW MANY TIMES YOU ASK,

13:59.375 --> 14:00.667
IT WILL NEVER BE POSSIBLE
FOR YOU TO DROP THIS COURSE

14:00.667 --> 14:03.333
WITHOUT FORFEITING YOUR
CREDITS FROM THE FIRST SEMESTER.

14:03.333 --> 14:04.458
LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO BE STANDING HERE
TALKING TO YOU

14:04.458 --> 14:06.208
ANY MORE THAN YOU WANT
TO BE LISTENING TO ME.

14:06.208 --> 14:09.458
I JUST NEED TO TELL YOU
THAT YOUR DAUGHTER...

14:09.458 --> 14:11.834
WELL, SHE MAY NOT BE
AS SAFELY ENSCONCED
IN MILTON ACADEMY

14:11.834 --> 14:15.166
AS YOU CURRENTLY
THINK SHE IS.

14:15.166 --> 14:17.208
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

14:17.208 --> 14:18.917
SHE'S CUTTING CLASS, OK?

14:20.208 --> 14:23.333
I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED
AS TO WHY YOU'RE TELLING ME.

14:23.333 --> 14:25.333
SHE CAME INTO
THE BAR YESTERDAY,

14:25.333 --> 14:28.000
ON THE LAM FROM
SOME FIELD TRIP, AND...

14:28.000 --> 14:29.417
GOD KNOWS WHERE
SHE WENT WHEN SHE LEFT.

14:29.417 --> 14:30.500
I JUST...

14:30.500 --> 14:32.708
BUT CALL ME CRAZY,
I JUST FIGURE

14:32.708 --> 14:33.959
THESE ARE
THE THINGS THE FATHER
OF A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL

14:33.959 --> 14:37.250
WANDERING THE STREETS
OF BOSTON SHOULD KNOW.

14:37.250 --> 14:40.708
THE SUBTEXT HERE BEING
THAT THESE ARE THE THINGS
THAT A FATHER WOULD KNOW

14:40.708 --> 14:42.291
IF HE WERE
PAYING ATTENTION.

14:42.291 --> 14:42.875
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

14:42.875 --> 14:44.625
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.

14:44.625 --> 14:46.792
LOOK...

14:46.792 --> 14:48.375
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

14:48.375 --> 14:51.542
(SIGHS) LET'S MAKE ANOTHER ONE
OF OUR FAMOUS DEALS.

14:51.542 --> 14:53.792
YOU STAY OUT OF MY LIFE,

14:53.792 --> 14:57.166
AND I'LL DO MY VERY BEST
TO STAY OUT OF YOURS.

14:57.166 --> 15:00.041
GLADLY. YOU KNOW,
I'M SORRY FOR
THE INTRUSION.

15:00.041 --> 15:01.917
I GUESS I WAS NAIVE
ENOUGH TO THINK THAT

15:01.917 --> 15:03.625
THIS MIGHT
ACTUALLY BE ABOUT
SOMETHING OTHER

15:03.625 --> 15:05.792
THAN YOUR
GIGANTIC MALE EGO.

15:10.500 --> 15:13.333
SO YOU'RE SAYING
THAT THAT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU,

15:13.333 --> 15:16.083
THE WHOLE LIFE-AS-REPETITIVE-
STRESS-INJURY THING?

15:16.083 --> 15:19.041
NO, IT DOES,
BUT NOTHING
PREPARES YOU

15:19.041 --> 15:21.417
FOR A LIFE OF
MIND-NUMBING BOREDOM
AND REPETITION

15:21.417 --> 15:23.917
SO MUCH AS STUDYING
MUSIC AS A CHILD.

15:23.917 --> 15:25.125
PIANO LESSONS?
VIOLIN.

15:25.125 --> 15:28.542
YEESH.
YEAH. MY MUM TAUGHT
PIANO, THOUGH,

15:28.542 --> 15:31.625
TO A SERIES OF
EVER-CHANGING TWITS

15:31.625 --> 15:33.083
WHO ALL HAD
ONE THING IN COMMON:

15:33.083 --> 15:35.333
THEY WERE
ALLERGIC TO DOGS.

15:35.333 --> 15:36.917
SO YOU HAD FISH.

15:36.917 --> 15:38.750
TANKS FULL.

15:38.750 --> 15:39.375
SO, WHAT'S YOURS, THEN?

15:39.375 --> 15:41.250
MY WHAT?

15:41.250 --> 15:42.750
YOU EXCUSE
FOR COMING HERE EVERY DAY.

15:42.750 --> 15:45.834
IT CAN'T SIMPLY BE A MATTER
OF GEOGRAPHIC PROXIMITY.

15:45.834 --> 15:49.542
NO, IT'S NOT.
IT'S, UH...

15:49.542 --> 15:51.041
IT'S MUCH LIKE
YOURS, REALLY.

15:51.041 --> 15:53.417
IT'S SORT OF A WINDOW
INTO THE PERSON
THAT I USED TO BE.

15:53.417 --> 15:55.000
YOU USED TO BE
ANOTHER PERSON?

15:55.000 --> 15:56.667
MUCH AS I'M SURE
YOU WEREN'T BORN
WITH PINK HAIR,

15:56.667 --> 15:59.125
I AM NOT
THE CONSERVATIVE PERSON
YOU THINK THAT I AM.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.166
YOU'RE NOT?

16:00.166 --> 16:00.625
NO, I'M NOT.

16:00.625 --> 16:04.125
PROVE IT.

16:04.125 --> 16:05.375
STAY.

16:05.375 --> 16:06.417
STAY HERE?

16:06.417 --> 16:07.375
COME ON, I DON'T THINK

16:07.375 --> 16:08.625
YOU TAKING
ONE AFTERNOON OFF

16:08.625 --> 16:10.667
IS GOING TO SEND
CAPITALISM SCREECHING
TO ITS KNEES.

16:10.667 --> 16:11.583
NO, IT PROBABLY WON'T,

16:11.583 --> 16:13.333
BUT IT WILL
CATAPULT ME TO THE TOP

16:13.333 --> 16:14.625
OF THE RICH RINALDI
FIRING LIST.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.792
YEAH, THAT'S SUCH
A BLOODY TRAGEDY.

16:16.792 --> 16:18.291
HERE.

16:18.291 --> 16:19.792
CALL THEM.

16:19.792 --> 16:22.208
TELL THEM, I DON'T KNOW,
THAT YOU'RE SICK OR SOMETHING.

16:22.208 --> 16:23.625
YOU'RE SERIOUS
ABOUT THIS?

16:23.625 --> 16:24.750
YEAH.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.708
QUESTION IS: ARE YOU?

16:26.708 --> 16:28.333
(LAUGHS)

16:34.834 --> 16:38.291
HI. CAN I SPEAK
TO RICH RINALDI, PLEASE?

16:38.291 --> 16:39.625
(COUGHS)

16:39.625 --> 16:42.208
(COUGHS)

16:42.208 --> 16:44.667
OK, WELL, IF WHAT YOU'RE
TELLING ME IS TRUE,

16:44.667 --> 16:46.500
IS THAT YOU'VE--
YOU'VE HAD UNPROTECTED SEX

16:46.500 --> 16:47.959
WITH 17 WOMEN
IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS,

16:47.959 --> 16:50.708
THEN I DEFINITELY THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU
TO GET TESTED.

16:50.708 --> 16:54.750
FOR YOU AND FOR
ALL OF THOSE HOT WOMEN
YOU'VE BEEN SLEEPING WITH.

16:54.750 --> 16:56.417
WHAT?

16:56.417 --> 16:59.166
WHAT? I HAVE NAILED
MANY A HOT GIRL IN MY DAY.

16:59.166 --> 17:00.500
HEY, I BELIEVE YOU.

17:00.500 --> 17:01.917
THANK YOU.

17:01.917 --> 17:03.291
I CAN'T BELIEVE I VOLUNTEER
TO HELP YOU GUYS

17:03.291 --> 17:04.625
AND GET CRITICIZED
FOR MY ACTING ABILITIES.

17:04.625 --> 17:07.000
OH, PLEASE,
LIKE YOU COULD
EVER BE STRAIGHT.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
YOUR HEART
IS TOO BIG,

17:08.000 --> 17:09.500
AND SO IS YOUR BRAIN.

17:09.500 --> 17:13.165
(LAUGHS) SHE'S HOSTILE.
TOLD YOU.

17:13.165 --> 17:16.458
COULD YOU PLEASE
NOT TALK ABOUT ME
LIKE I'M NOT IN THE ROOM.

17:16.458 --> 17:18.083
SO I HAVE SOME ANGER.

17:18.083 --> 17:22.500
CAN YOU TELL ME THAT
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH
EXPRESSING YOUR EMOTIONS?

17:22.500 --> 17:23.666
HEY!

17:23.666 --> 17:24.916
SORRY.
AM I, UH,
INTERRUPTING--

17:24.916 --> 17:26.625
NO, NO, IT'S COOL.

17:26.625 --> 17:29.083
WE'RE--WE'RE DONE HERE,
I THINK.

17:29.083 --> 17:30.208
YEAH, IT'S 4:00.
WE'RE DONE.

17:30.208 --> 17:31.667
SO...

17:31.667 --> 17:34.875
YOU GUYS THINK
YOU CAN GET ALONG
WITHOUT ME TOMORROW, OR WHAT?

17:34.875 --> 17:36.917
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WAIT A SECOND.

17:36.917 --> 17:38.542
YOU MEAN THE ONLY REASON
YOU'RE HANGING AROUND
HERE ALL AFTERNOON

17:38.542 --> 17:40.041
INSTEAD OF
WASTING TIME WITH ME

17:40.041 --> 17:42.458
IS BECAUSE SHE
CAN'T MANAGE TO GET
ALONG WITH HIM?

17:42.458 --> 17:43.208
JEN?

17:43.208 --> 17:44.542
ARE YOU MAD
AT ME, TOO?

17:44.542 --> 17:48.708
YOU CAN'T LOAN ME
YOUR BOYFRIEND
FOR ONE MEASLY HOUR?

17:48.708 --> 17:50.041
IS HE YOUR BOYFRIEND?

17:50.041 --> 17:51.125
HAVE YOU GUYS
KISSED YET?

17:51.125 --> 17:52.875
DID I MISS ALL OF THIS
OVER CHRISTMAS VACATION?

17:52.875 --> 17:56.000
CHARMING.
LET'S GO.

18:00.333 --> 18:02.208
WHY ARE
YOU LOOKING AT ME?

18:03.875 --> 18:05.708
HOSTILE.

18:17.417 --> 18:20.000
(SIGHS)

18:22.583 --> 18:23.500
AHA.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.917
SO HE'S CHANGED
HIS MIND, HAS HE?

18:25.917 --> 18:27.708
COME TO HIS SENSES?

18:27.708 --> 18:30.083
NOT THAT HIS APOLOGY'S
GOING TO BE ACCEPTED,
MIND YOU.

18:30.083 --> 18:32.250
SO WHERE IS HE?

18:32.250 --> 18:34.708
CAUGHT IN TRAFFIC?
SMOKING?

18:35.750 --> 18:38.917
NOT EXACTLY.

18:38.917 --> 18:40.250
DAWSON?

18:40.250 --> 18:43.250
YEAH. YOU KNOW,
TECHNICALLY, ACTUALLY,

18:43.250 --> 18:44.750
HE'S NOT GONNA
BE HERE TODAY,

18:44.750 --> 18:46.500
UH, BECAUSE
TECHNICALLY, HE...

18:46.500 --> 18:48.875
DOESN'T KNOW THAT THIS
MEETING IS TAKING PLACE.

18:50.750 --> 18:52.583
YOU SET THIS UP?

18:52.583 --> 18:53.625
UM--

18:53.625 --> 18:55.583
YEAH.

18:55.583 --> 18:57.417
UH, TECHNICALLY.

18:57.417 --> 19:01.083
(CHUCKLES) YOU SET THIS UP
TO APOLOGIZE FOR HIM,

19:01.083 --> 19:03.125
TO SMOOTH THINGS OVER,

19:03.125 --> 19:05.291
TO CLEAN UP
AFTER HIS MESS...

19:05.291 --> 19:07.792
LIKE YOU'VE BEEN DOING
ALL ALONG?

19:07.792 --> 19:10.417
YEAH, KIND OF.

19:10.417 --> 19:14.583
LOOK, NOBODY SETS OUT
TO MAKE A BAD FILM.

19:14.583 --> 19:16.458
TODD WANTS IT
TO BE BETTER.
I KNOW THAT HE DOES.

19:16.458 --> 19:17.959
AND HE MIGHT BE
TOO PROUD TO ADMIT IT,

19:17.959 --> 19:19.625
BUT HE'S GOT, LIKE,
5 ALTERNATE ENDINGS
IN HIS HEAD.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.500
THIS IS STUFF WE'VE
BEEN TALKING ABOUT
ALL ALONG,

19:21.500 --> 19:23.667
STUFF THAT CAN
EASILY BE DONE ON
A SOUNDSTAGE IN 3 DAYS

19:23.667 --> 19:25.792
FOR NO MONEY.

19:25.792 --> 19:27.542
WELL, THAT'S ALL
VERY SWEET AND MOVING,

19:27.542 --> 19:31.125
BUT SINCE I DON'T
SEE HIM HERE ON HIS KNEES
BEGGING FOR FORGIVENESS,

19:31.125 --> 19:34.000
YOU'RE WASTING MY TIME,
MY FRIEND.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
UNLESS--

19:35.000 --> 19:36.500
UNLESS WHAT?

19:36.500 --> 19:37.959
UNLESS THE ANSWER
TO OUR PROBLEMS

19:37.959 --> 19:39.208
IS SITTING RIGHT
IN FRONT OF US.

19:39.208 --> 19:40.208
EXCUSE ME?

19:40.208 --> 19:41.291
EXCUSE ME?

19:41.291 --> 19:42.750
I KNOW THIS IS
GONNA SOUND CRAZY,

19:42.750 --> 19:45.583
BUT JUST STAY
WITH ME FOR A SECOND.

19:45.583 --> 19:47.542
HE KNOWS THE FOOTAGE
WE'VE ALREADY SHOT.

19:47.542 --> 19:50.750
HE KNOWS THE SCRIPT,
THE ACTORS, THE CREW.

19:50.750 --> 19:53.708
PERSONALLY,
FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN,

19:53.708 --> 19:54.959
I THINK HE COULD DO IT.

19:56.208 --> 19:57.333
WAIT A MINUTE.
HOLD ON A SECOND.

19:57.333 --> 19:59.417
WHAT? YOU'RE SAYING
YOU CAN'T DO THIS?

19:59.417 --> 20:00.250
NO. I'M SAYING
THIS IS INSANE.

20:00.250 --> 20:02.667
ALL RIGHT,
LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

20:02.667 --> 20:06.250
HYPOTHETICALLY,
IF YOU HAD TO,

20:06.250 --> 20:08.250
COULD YOU DIRECT
THE RESHOOTS OF THIS MOVIE?

20:08.250 --> 20:09.125
WELL, YES,
BUT THAT'S NOT--

20:09.125 --> 20:11.208
ALL RIGHT.
CALL HIS AGENT.

20:11.208 --> 20:12.917
I DON'T THINK HE HAS ONE.

20:12.917 --> 20:14.125
WELL, THEN DON'T
CALL HIS AGENT.

20:14.125 --> 20:15.792
CALL HIS MOTHER AND MAKE HER
SIGN A PERMISSION SLIP.

20:15.792 --> 20:18.333
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT--
HOLD ON A SECOND.
THIS IS INSANE.

20:18.333 --> 20:20.333
THIS IS--THIS IS NOT
WHY I CAME HERE TODAY.

20:20.333 --> 20:22.083
THIS IS NOT WHAT
I WANTED TO HAVE HAPPEN.

20:22.083 --> 20:24.458
WELL, GUESS WHAT?
IT DID.

20:24.458 --> 20:27.125
AND SINCE
OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THIS
DON'T COME ALONG EVERY DAY,

20:27.125 --> 20:29.041
I'D HOP ON
THE HAPPY TRAIN.

20:29.041 --> 20:31.458
OR, I'M SORRY,

20:31.458 --> 20:33.333
IS BEING A DIRECTOR
NOT THE FULFILLMENT
OF A DREAM

20:33.333 --> 20:35.708
YOU'VE BEEN WAITING
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE FOR?

20:35.708 --> 20:37.041
NO, IT IS.
IT DEFINITELY IS, BUT--

20:37.041 --> 20:39.000
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

20:46.417 --> 20:47.458
(DOOR CLOSES)

20:47.458 --> 20:48.875
OH, BOY.

20:52.625 --> 20:56.417
SO DID WE EVER FIGURE OUT
WHOSE PARTY THIS WAS?

20:56.417 --> 20:58.583
NO. SOME DUDE'S,

20:58.583 --> 21:01.291
THEN I DON'T SUPPOSE
WE EVER FIGURED OUT
WHAT DAY IT IS.

21:01.291 --> 21:04.083
COME ON!
GIVE ME A BREAK!

21:04.083 --> 21:05.125
SO'S YOUR FRIEND COMING
TO PICK US UP OR WHAT?

21:05.125 --> 21:08.083
I REALLY VOTE
WE TAKE A CAB.

21:08.083 --> 21:09.583
YEAH, AND PAY
THE GUY WITH WHAT?

21:09.583 --> 21:12.083
YOU KNOW, YOU BEING FAMOUS
DOESN'T MAKE ME ANY LESS BROKE.

21:12.083 --> 21:13.708
WHAT? YOU'RE BROKE?

21:13.708 --> 21:15.959
YES, JACK,
AUDREY LIDDELL IS BROKE.

21:15.959 --> 21:17.917
IS THAT SO IMPOSSIBLE
TO BELIEVE?

21:17.917 --> 21:20.458
WOW. SOMEONE
MUST BE PAYING TOO MUCH
FOR THEIR DRUGS.

21:20.458 --> 21:23.250
YOU KNOW, CONTRARY
TO POPULAR OPINION,
I'M NOT ON DRUGS.

21:23.250 --> 21:24.875
YEAH, RIGHT.

21:24.875 --> 21:27.583
YOU KNOW, I HATE TO BE
JUDGMENTAL LIKE YOUR
WEIRD COLLEGE FRIENDS,

21:27.583 --> 21:29.125
BUT PLEASE DON'T RIP
MY LUNGS OUT OF MY CHEST

21:29.125 --> 21:31.500
WHEN YOU HAVE
SOME BAD PCP.

21:31.500 --> 21:32.792
SHUT UP, WILL YOU?
HE'S COMING.

21:32.792 --> 21:33.959
WHO? YOUR FRIEND?

21:33.959 --> 21:35.959
DAWSON. DAWSON LEERY.

21:35.959 --> 21:37.458
I'M SORT OF ON THIN ICE
WITH HIM AT THE MOMENT,

21:37.458 --> 21:38.583
SO IF YOU CAN FIND IT
WITHIN YOURSELF

21:38.583 --> 21:40.041
TO SHUT UP ABOUT DRUGS FOR,
I DON'T KNOW,

21:40.041 --> 21:41.125
SAY, THE NEXT HALF AN HOUR--

21:41.125 --> 21:42.792
WHAT? YOU'LL MAKE IT
WORTH MY WHILE?

21:42.792 --> 21:44.542
DON'T I ALWAYS?

21:44.542 --> 21:46.083
SO YOU'RE SAYING I CAN
GO THROUGH YOUR UNDERWEAR
DRAWER UNSUPERVISED?

21:46.083 --> 21:48.458
NO! THAT'S GROSS!

21:48.458 --> 21:49.959
I'LL SIT ON YOUR LAP
THE WHOLE WAY HOME, OK?

21:49.959 --> 21:52.000
ALL RIGHT. COOL.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.333
BUT ONE WORD ABOUT
ANY SORT OF ILLEGAL SUBSTANCE,

21:53.333 --> 21:54.291
AND YOU HAVE BLOWN IT.

21:54.291 --> 21:56.250
HEY, I HAVE
SELF-CONTROL.

21:56.250 --> 21:59.125
I'LL BELIEVE THAT
WHEN I SEE IT.

21:59.125 --> 22:02.667
I'M GOING TO GO
WAIT IN THE CAR.

22:02.667 --> 22:04.458
HEY, JACK.
HEY.

22:07.708 --> 22:09.792
HEY.

22:09.792 --> 22:11.125
YOU CAME.

22:11.125 --> 22:12.542
YEAH.
YOU CALLED, RIGHT?

22:12.542 --> 22:14.792
THE FACT THAT I RECENTLY
DESTROYED YOUR HOUSE
WITH AN AUTOMOBILE

22:14.792 --> 22:17.959
MUST HAVE, UH,
SLIPPED MY MIND
WHEN I WAS DIALING.

22:17.959 --> 22:20.708
I FREAKED OUT, OK?

22:20.708 --> 22:22.166
WHAT, THEN
OR RIGHT NOW?

22:22.166 --> 22:24.125
BOTH, I GUESS.

22:29.166 --> 22:31.917
WHAT ARE YOU EVEN
DOING HERE, AUDREY?

22:31.917 --> 22:33.834
HERE IN L.A. OR HERE
AT THIS WEIRD PARTY?

22:33.834 --> 22:35.041
EITHER ONE.

22:35.041 --> 22:36.625
I DON'T KNOW.

22:36.625 --> 22:40.208
ONE MINUTE,
JACK AND I ARE, LIKE,
IN A PARKING LOT OFF SUNSET

22:40.208 --> 22:41.500
TALKING TO THESE GUYS
IN A LIMO,

22:41.500 --> 22:44.333
AND THE NEXT MINUTE, WE'RE
HERE, AND IT'S MORNING, AND...

22:44.333 --> 22:46.000
(SIGHS)

22:46.000 --> 22:48.125
LIKE I SAID,

22:48.125 --> 22:49.959
I JUST FREAKED, AND...

22:49.959 --> 22:53.500
YOU WERE THE ONLY PERSON
THAT I KNEW WOULD BE
IN THIS AREA CODE

22:53.500 --> 22:55.333
AND WOULD DEFINITELY
BE AWAKE AT THIS HOUR.

22:55.333 --> 22:57.208
WHAT ABOUT
YOUR PARENTS?

22:57.208 --> 22:59.041
PLEASE.

22:59.041 --> 23:01.417
DO THEY EVEN KNOW
THAT SCHOOL STARTED
BACK ALREADY?

23:01.417 --> 23:04.542
NO.

23:04.542 --> 23:07.208
I WASN'T READY
TO GO BACK LAST WEEK,

23:07.208 --> 23:12.083
SO I LIED A LITTLE BIT.

23:12.083 --> 23:18.583
I DIDN'T WANT TO FACE
THE GRAND TRIBUNAL OF JUDGMENT.

23:18.583 --> 23:19.834
I'M READY NOW, THOUGH.

23:19.834 --> 23:23.083
AND I'M GOING TO BE GOOD
FROM NOW ON, DAWSON, I SWEAR.

23:23.083 --> 23:24.208
JUST...

23:24.208 --> 23:25.500
DON'T BE MAD.

23:25.500 --> 23:29.000
I MEAN,
DON'T BE ANY MORE MAD
THAN YOU ALREADY ARE.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.583
(SIGHS)
ALL RIGHT. JUST...

23:31.583 --> 23:33.625
TELL ME YOU REALIZE
HOW STUPID IT IS

23:33.625 --> 23:34.917
TO GET IN A CAR
FULL OF STRANGERS

23:34.917 --> 23:37.375
THAT YOU MEET
IN A PARKING LOT.

23:41.959 --> 23:43.458
HEY, IT'S ME AGAIN.

23:43.458 --> 23:45.959
UM, LOOK, I GET
THAT YOU'RE AVOIDING ME.

23:45.959 --> 23:48.917
I DO. MANY DAYS,
NO PHONE CALLS.
WHAT COULD BE CLEARER?

23:48.917 --> 23:52.041
BUT, UM...

23:52.041 --> 23:53.750
I'M SCARED NOW,

23:53.750 --> 23:56.083
BECAUSE I DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHY YOU
WOULDN'T CALL ME BACK.

23:56.083 --> 23:57.208
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU, OK?

23:57.208 --> 23:58.208
AND I GUESS
I'M JUST SCARED

23:58.208 --> 23:59.583
THAT SOMETHING MAY
HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU,

23:59.583 --> 24:01.333
BECAUSE--AND EVEN
IF SOMETHING DID
HAPPEN TO YOU,

24:01.333 --> 24:02.583
I WOULDN'T
KNOW ABOUT IT,
BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY,

24:02.583 --> 24:04.166
I'M NOT A VERY IMPORTANT
PERSON IN YOUR LIFE.

24:04.166 --> 24:05.917
SO...

24:05.917 --> 24:07.792
COULD YOU JUST...

24:07.792 --> 24:08.166
CALL ME BACK?

24:08.166 --> 24:09.750
UH...

24:09.750 --> 24:12.750
CALL ME BACK
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

24:12.750 --> 24:14.208
BYE.

24:23.959 --> 24:25.208
MMM...

24:25.208 --> 24:26.125
ANY LUCK THIS TIME?

24:26.125 --> 24:29.083
WHEN HAVE I EVER
BEEN LUCKY WITH MEN?

24:29.083 --> 24:31.458
HE'LL CALL YOU BACK, JOEY.
I KNOW HE WILL.

24:31.458 --> 24:32.959
UH, YEAH, YEAH.

24:32.959 --> 24:35.125
THERE'S USUALLY A VERY
LOGICAL EXPLANATION
FOR THIS KIND OF THING.

24:35.125 --> 24:37.125
YEAH, I GUESS.

24:40.125 --> 24:41.500
HEY, CAN YOU GUYS, UM--

24:41.500 --> 24:44.083
PAY THE BILL THAT'S
BEEN SITTING HERE FOR,
LIKE, A CENTURY?

24:44.083 --> 24:45.375
YEAH.

24:45.375 --> 24:45.959
YOU GUYS ARE WELCOME
TO STAY AS LONG AS YOU WANT.

24:45.959 --> 24:48.250
IT'S JUST...

24:48.250 --> 24:50.250
I DON'T FEEL THAT GREAT.
I WANT TO GET HOME EARLY.

24:50.250 --> 24:52.291
YEAH, IT'S NO PROBLEM.

24:52.291 --> 24:53.875
HERE. AHEM.

24:53.875 --> 24:55.125
KEEP THE CHANGE.

24:55.125 --> 24:56.959
THANKS. THANKS A LOT.

24:56.959 --> 24:58.166
BYE.

24:59.667 --> 25:01.458
WELL,
THAT WAS DEPRESSING.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.834
THERE'S NOTHING
SADDER IN THE UNIVERSE

25:03.834 --> 25:04.875
THAN WATCHING SOMEBODY
WAIT FOR A PHONE CALL

25:04.875 --> 25:07.625
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY
NEVER GOING TO COME.

25:07.625 --> 25:09.166
OH, SURE THERE IS.

25:09.166 --> 25:10.750
THERE'S ORPHANS,
SICK ORPHANS.

25:10.750 --> 25:13.458
PLUS, WE DON'T KNOW
IF THIS GUY'S NOT GONNA CALL.

25:13.458 --> 25:15.000
OH, PLEASE.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.417
WE'RE GUYS, AREN'T WE?

25:16.417 --> 25:17.208
HOW MANY PEOPLE
HAVE YOU RUTHLESSLY
HOOKED UP WITH

25:17.208 --> 25:19.166
AND NEVER CALLED?

25:19.166 --> 25:20.750
A FEW.

25:24.166 --> 25:25.959
LOOK, I WENT OUT A LOT
THIS SUMMER, ALL RIGHT?

25:25.959 --> 25:28.375
AND?

25:28.375 --> 25:31.041
AND I DIDN'T CALL
A FEW OF THE GUYS BACK.

25:31.041 --> 25:32.333
LOOK, IF A STRAIGHT GUY
DID IT,

25:32.333 --> 25:34.208
IT WOULD BE RAKISHLY
CHARMING, YOU KNOW?

25:34.208 --> 25:35.166
YOU MEET SOMEONE, OK?

25:35.166 --> 25:36.041
YOU THINK YOU'RE
GOING TO LIKE THEM--

25:36.041 --> 25:38.667
AND THEN AFTER
CLOSER EXAMINATION,

25:38.667 --> 25:39.083
YOU DON'T.

25:39.083 --> 25:40.166
YEAH.

25:40.166 --> 25:42.041
BUT ONLY AFTER

25:42.041 --> 25:44.000
THE CLOSER
EXAMINATION PART.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.375
BASICALLY.

25:45.375 --> 25:46.291
ARE YOU GOING
TO GIVE ME SOME KIND
OF LECTURE HERE, OR WHAT?

25:46.291 --> 25:47.458
DO YOU WANT ONE?

25:47.458 --> 25:49.959
NOT PARTICULARLY.
FINE.

25:49.959 --> 25:50.875
FINE.

26:01.208 --> 26:04.875
OK. LET'S GO, HARLEY.

26:04.875 --> 26:06.208
YOU'RE OUTTA HERE.
GET YOUR COAT.

26:06.208 --> 26:07.583
EXCUSE ME?

26:07.583 --> 26:08.708
LOOK, I REALLY DON'T
HAVE THE ENERGY

26:08.708 --> 26:10.166
TO GO THROUGH
ALL OF THIS AGAIN TODAY.

26:10.166 --> 26:11.250
IN CASE YOU'VE
FORGOTTEN,

26:11.250 --> 26:12.875
WE'VE ALREADY PLAYED
THIS SCENE 2 DAYS AGO.

26:12.875 --> 26:15.917
YEAH, AND THEN
YOU RATTED ME OUT
TO MY FATHER,

26:15.917 --> 26:17.458
WHO GROUNDED ME
FOR A MONTH.

26:17.458 --> 26:19.375
SO I FIGURED
THE ONLY WAY
I COULD REPAY YOU

26:19.375 --> 26:21.250
WOULD BE
TO CUT CLASS AGAIN.

26:21.250 --> 26:22.500
RIGHT.

26:22.500 --> 26:23.667
YOU REALLY THINK
I'M GOING TO LEAVE YOU HERE

26:23.667 --> 26:25.458
WITH A POSSIBLE DATE-RAPIST
WHO THINKS YOU'RE 18?

26:25.458 --> 26:26.250
I DON'T THINK SO.

26:26.250 --> 26:27.917
I'M LEAVING.
YOU'RE LEAVING.

26:27.917 --> 26:29.708
LET'S GO NOW.

26:41.250 --> 26:44.750
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU TALKED ME
INTO STAYING FOR THIS YESTERDAY.

26:44.750 --> 26:46.083
I MEAN, BIG FISH
EATING LITTLE FISH.
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

26:46.083 --> 26:48.166
THIS IS
WHAT YOU DRAG YOUR BUTT
DOWN HERE FOR EVERY DAY?

26:48.166 --> 26:50.333
WELL, IF IT WAS
A BIG COMPANY EATING
A LITTLE COMPANY,

26:50.333 --> 26:51.291
YOU'D LOVE IT.

26:51.291 --> 26:53.250
AND FOR THE RECORD,

26:53.250 --> 26:54.250
I DON'T COME HERE
EVERY DAY.

26:54.250 --> 26:55.458
YOU DON'T?

26:55.458 --> 26:57.792
NOT NORMALLY, NO.

26:57.792 --> 26:59.792
USUALLY JUST WHEN
I HAVE A HANGOVER.

26:59.792 --> 27:01.125
SO, THEN WHAT WAS THIS WEEK?

27:01.125 --> 27:02.166
SOME SORT
OF SPECIAL OCCASION?

27:02.166 --> 27:05.208
I'VE JUST BEEN WONDERING
WHAT'S IT ALL FOR.

27:05.208 --> 27:07.917
I MEAN, IF WHAT YOU'VE
TOLD ME OVER THE LAST
COUPLE OF DAYS IS TRUE,

27:07.917 --> 27:10.291
THEN YOU'VE
PRETTY MUCH CHANGED
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE,

27:10.291 --> 27:11.792
AND I'M NOT
ENTIRELY SURE WHY.

27:11.792 --> 27:13.375
HOW THE HELL SHOULD I KNOW?

27:13.375 --> 27:14.959
WHY DOES ANYBODY
CHANGE THEIR LIFE?

27:14.959 --> 27:16.792
WHY DO PEOPLE
DYE THEIR HAIR,
FOR THAT MATTER?

27:16.792 --> 27:18.917
TO PISS OFF MY MUM.

27:18.917 --> 27:21.291
OR TO TRY
TO BE SOMEBODY ELSE?

27:21.291 --> 27:22.792
FOR ME,
IT WOULD BE THE LATTER.

27:22.792 --> 27:24.708
AND WHY DO YOU WANT
TO BE SOMEBODY ELSE?

27:24.708 --> 27:26.542
BECAUSE THAT'S
A PART OF GROWING UP.

27:26.542 --> 27:28.417
LET ME TELL YOU,
PACEY AT 15 WAS
A BIT OF A SCHMUCK--

27:28.417 --> 27:30.500
BAD HAIRCUT,
BAD HAWAIIAN SHIRTS,

27:30.500 --> 27:32.083
BROKE ALL THE TIME.

27:32.083 --> 27:33.542
DUMB ENOUGH TO BE CHASING
AFTER THINGS

27:33.542 --> 27:34.917
HE KNEW HE WAS NEVER
GOING TO GET, ANYWAY.

27:34.917 --> 27:37.667
MOSTLY WOMEN,
I SUPPOSE.

27:37.667 --> 27:38.500
MOSTLY...

27:38.500 --> 27:39.792
THOUGH THERE WERE
A FEW GIRLS.

27:39.792 --> 27:42.125
AND YOU ARE ALLOWED
TO CALL THEM GIRLS
WHEN THEY'RE 16.

27:42.125 --> 27:43.333
HMM.

27:43.333 --> 27:46.333
NOT THAT YOU CARE
WHAT I THINK, BUT...

27:46.333 --> 27:49.083
I DON'T THINK
HE SOUNDS THAT BAD,

27:49.083 --> 27:51.208
THIS PERSON YOU USED TO BE.

27:51.208 --> 27:52.500
HE ACTUALLY SOUNDS
KIND OF NICE.

27:52.500 --> 27:55.500
YEAH, WELL,
MAYBE HE WAS...

27:55.500 --> 27:56.458
OCCASIONALLY.

27:56.458 --> 27:58.375
HMM, STILL COULD BE.

27:58.375 --> 28:01.333
QUIT THE JOB.

28:01.333 --> 28:04.083
GET RID OF THAT GOATEE.

28:04.083 --> 28:04.917
GROW BACK
THE TERRIBLE HAIRCUT.

28:08.208 --> 28:09.542
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU

28:09.542 --> 28:11.875
I'D ACTUALLY
BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THAT LATELY?

28:11.875 --> 28:13.166
I'M NOT SURE
I'D BELIEVE YOU.

28:13.166 --> 28:15.542
UNLESS...

28:15.542 --> 28:16.542
UNLESS WHAT?

28:16.542 --> 28:19.333
UNLESS YOU SHOWED UP
HERE AGAIN TOMORROW,

28:19.333 --> 28:21.834
PROMPTLY, AT 1:00,

28:21.834 --> 28:24.792
WEARING SOME WRETCHED
HAWAIIAN T-SHIRT.

28:32.917 --> 28:35.000
LOOK, YOU KNOW THAT
THAT'S NOT TRUE, RIGHT?

28:35.000 --> 28:36.250
I MEAN,
JUST BECAUSE A GIRL

28:36.250 --> 28:38.333
HAS A LESS THAN PERFECT
RELATIONSHIP
WITH HER FATHER,

28:38.333 --> 28:39.375
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT SHE
WON'T BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN

28:39.375 --> 28:42.041
A MORE MEANINGFUL
RELATIONSHIP IN--

28:42.041 --> 28:44.083
HEL--HELLO?

28:44.083 --> 28:45.750
HELLO?

28:45.750 --> 28:46.875
SHE HUNG UP ON ME.

28:46.875 --> 28:50.041
MY FIRST REAL
NONHYPOTHETICAL CALLER,

28:50.041 --> 28:51.834
AND SHE HUNG UP ON ME.

28:51.834 --> 28:53.375
SOMEBODY PROBABLY
WALKED IN THE ROOM.

28:53.375 --> 28:54.875
YOU KNOW, A ROOMMATE
OR SOMETHING. SHE GOT
EMBARRASSED AND HUNG UP.

28:54.875 --> 28:57.041
NO, YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

28:57.041 --> 28:58.375
NO, YOU WERE DOING FINE.

28:58.375 --> 28:59.542
WHY DID THIS HAVE
TO BE BOY TROUBLE?

28:59.542 --> 29:03.250
WHY COULDN'T IT
HAVE BEEN A NICE
EATING DISORDER

29:03.250 --> 29:05.750
OR A HOMESICK FRESHMAN
IN NEED OF A GOOD OLD
EGO BOOST?

29:05.750 --> 29:08.041
(TELEPHONE RINGS)

29:08.041 --> 29:09.625
YOU GONNA ANSWER THAT?
NO.

29:09.625 --> 29:10.792
SHE WAS TALKING TO YOU.

29:10.792 --> 29:12.291
SHE'S PROBABLY GONNA WANNA
BE TALKING TO YOU AGAIN.

29:12.291 --> 29:13.667
NO, I--I DON'T
WANNA ANSWER IT.

29:13.667 --> 29:16.417
I'M JUST GONNA
MESS IT UP AGAIN.
Y-Y-YOU DO IT.

29:16.417 --> 29:17.542
ARE YOU SURE?
YES.
JUST ANSWER IT.

29:17.542 --> 29:20.917
HELP LINE.
THIS IS C.J.

29:20.917 --> 29:24.708
NO, SHE HAD TO STEP AWAY
FOR A SECOND.

29:24.708 --> 29:26.792
YEAH, SHE'S, UH--
SHE'S A LITTLE HIGH-STRUNG.

29:29.250 --> 29:29.834
OH, LET'S GIVE HER
A BREAK, THOUGH.

29:29.834 --> 29:32.458
IT'S HER FIRST DAY.

29:32.458 --> 29:35.583
YEAH, YEAH.
IT IS HARD TO TALK WHEN
OTHER PEOPLE ARE IN THE ROOM.

29:37.917 --> 29:40.500
WHY DON'T YOU CALL ME BACK
IN 10 MINUTES WHEN THEY'RE GONE?

29:40.500 --> 29:42.250
YEAH, I'LL BE HERE.

29:43.250 --> 29:45.208
ALL RIGHT. PROMISE ME
YOU'LL CALL ME BACK.

29:45.208 --> 29:47.917
OK. BYE.

29:51.500 --> 29:52.875
WHAT?

29:52.875 --> 29:55.959
NOTHING.

29:55.959 --> 29:59.500
Harley: HELLO? EVERY THIRD STORE
WE'RE PASSING SELLS LIQUOR.

29:59.500 --> 30:02.250
SHOULDN'T THIS INDICATE
TO YOU THAT WE'RE NOT
IN SUCH A GREAT PART OF TOWN?

30:02.250 --> 30:04.834
YEAH, WELL, YOU WANTED
TO WALK ON THE WILD SIDE,

30:04.834 --> 30:07.291
SO SINCE YOUR DAD
IS IN CLASS UNTIL 6:00...

30:07.291 --> 30:09.792
WE'RE HERE.

30:09.792 --> 30:11.500
WHERE ARE WE, ANYWAY?

30:11.500 --> 30:12.291
NOWHERE, OK?

30:12.291 --> 30:15.458
I JUST HAVE
TO DO SOMETHING.

30:15.458 --> 30:17.834
"EDDIE DOLING, 3-A"?

30:17.834 --> 30:20.041
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE HE WAS.

30:20.041 --> 30:21.000
I DON'T.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
I KNOW WHERE HE LIVES.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.375
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE IS.

30:23.375 --> 30:24.834
WELL, PERHAPS YOU'VE HEARD
OF THIS INVENTION:

30:24.834 --> 30:25.917
THE TELEPHONE?

30:25.917 --> 30:27.250
IT'S A HELPFUL STALKING TOOL.

30:27.250 --> 30:29.000
YEAH, I TRIED THAT
ALREADY, HARLEY,
THANK YOU,

30:29.000 --> 30:30.917
BUT WHEN A GIRL
LEAVES A WHOLE SLEW

30:30.917 --> 30:32.250
OF UNRETURNED
VOICE MAIL MESSAGES

30:32.250 --> 30:34.333
FOR SOMEONE SHE THOUGHT
WAS HER BOYFRIEND,
AND THEN--

30:34.333 --> 30:36.041
BOYFRIEND? UH-OH.
THAT MEANS ONE THING.

30:36.041 --> 30:36.667
YOU SLEPT WITH HIM,
DIDN'T YOU?

30:36.667 --> 30:37.834
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

30:37.834 --> 30:40.667
I ASKED IF YOU
SLEPT WITH THE BOY.

30:40.667 --> 30:42.875
YOU KNOW, HAD SEX?
GONE ALL THE WAY?

30:42.875 --> 30:44.166
I THOUGHT
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.

30:44.166 --> 30:47.125
YEAH, SO,
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

30:47.125 --> 30:50.667
NOTHING. I GUESS I...

30:50.667 --> 30:54.125
I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT
A SOPHISTICATED WOMAN
OF THE WORLD YOU ARE.

30:54.125 --> 30:55.834
HARLEY, YOU'RE PROBABLY
NOT EVEN A VIRGIN,

30:55.834 --> 30:58.917
PROBABLY LOST IT
YEARS AGO TO A TRUCKER
NAMED BUBBA, RIGHT?

31:01.417 --> 31:02.083
I DON'T GET IT.

31:02.083 --> 31:04.834
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO.

31:04.834 --> 31:07.041
LOOK, GO. I'M NOT
IN THE MOOD FOR THIS.

31:13.333 --> 31:14.333
Harley: SO WHAT?

31:14.333 --> 31:16.458
JUST BECAUSE I'M 15,

31:16.458 --> 31:17.542
I'M NOT EVEN ALLOWED
TO TALK ABOUT SEX?

31:17.542 --> 31:19.250
NO, YOU CAN TALK ABOUT IT,

31:19.250 --> 31:20.708
AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE 19, YOU
CAN HAVE THE UNADULTERATED JOY

31:20.708 --> 31:24.333
OF LOOKING BACK AND
REALIZING WHAT AN IDIOT
YOU SOUNDED LIKE.

31:30.792 --> 31:32.125
OH, RIGHT, BECAUSE
YOU'RE SO SMART NOW.

31:32.125 --> 31:35.041
YOU MUST KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

31:35.041 --> 31:36.708
THAT'S WHY YOU CAME
ALL THIS WAY TO STALK SOMEONE

31:36.708 --> 31:40.875
WHO HASN'T CALLED YOU BACK
SINCE YOU DECIDED
TO SLEEP WITH HIM.

31:40.875 --> 31:43.875
WHAT?
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

31:43.875 --> 31:46.208
WE'RE IN
THE WRONG APARTMENT, RIGHT?

31:52.291 --> 31:54.125
JOEY?

31:56.208 --> 31:59.667
I MEAN, THIS OBVIOUSLY
ISN'T IT, RIGHT?

31:59.667 --> 32:02.542
YOU GOT THE NUMBERS
SWITCHED OR SOMETHING.

32:06.291 --> 32:07.333

32:26.417 --> 32:27.959
Rich: I MUST SAY,
YOUR IDEA OF CASUAL FRIDAY

32:27.959 --> 32:30.000
LEAVES A LITTLE
TO BE DESIRED, WITTER.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.500
DO YOU THINK WE COULD
DISCUSS YOUR FASHION
DOS AND AND DON'TS

32:31.500 --> 32:32.166
SOME OTHER TIME?

32:32.166 --> 32:34.583
LIKE, SAY, AFTER LUNCH?

32:34.583 --> 32:36.583
LUNCH. THINK AGAIN,
MY FRIEND.

32:39.208 --> 32:40.250
WHAT'S ALL THAT?

32:40.250 --> 32:41.667
EXTRA WORK...

32:41.667 --> 32:44.625
OR, I'M SORRY, DID YOU THINK
YOUR LITTLE MINI-VACATION

32:44.625 --> 32:45.250
WOULD HAVE NO CONSEQUENCES?

32:45.250 --> 32:47.166
I TOLD YOU I WAS SICK.

32:47.166 --> 32:50.834
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T
GET SICK MYSELF,

32:50.834 --> 32:53.291
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
KILLS ME ABOUT PEOPLE WHO DO?

32:53.291 --> 32:54.583
WHAT'S WHAT?

32:54.583 --> 32:56.291
HOW THEY NEVER SEEM
TO REALIZE THAT
THEM BEING SICK

32:56.291 --> 32:58.625
DOESN'T DECREASE THE QUANTITY
OF WORK AROUND HERE.

32:58.625 --> 33:00.125
IT JUST MEANS SOMEONE ELSE
HAS TO DO IT.

33:00.125 --> 33:02.500
DOESN'T SEEM VERY FAIR
TO YOUR COLLEAGUES,
DOES IT, NOW?

33:02.500 --> 33:05.834
I CAN TELL
YOU'RE ALL BROKEN UP
ABOUT THAT, RICH,

33:05.834 --> 33:07.291
BUT PERHAPS WHAT YOU'RE
REALLY UPSET ABOUT

33:07.291 --> 33:09.542
IS THAT THEY JUST DON'T
OPEN UP AS MANY NEW
ACCOUNTS AS I DO.

33:09.542 --> 33:12.959
GETTING A LITTLE UNNECESSARILY
COCKY HERE, AREN'T WE?

33:12.959 --> 33:15.708
COCKY, YES,
UNNECESSARY, NO,

33:15.708 --> 33:17.792
BECAUSE ALL OF US HERE
KNOW THAT THE AMOUNT
OF MONEY YOU MAKE

33:17.792 --> 33:18.959
IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL
TO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY
WE MAKE.

33:18.959 --> 33:21.959
YEAH, WELL, THAT MAY BE TRUE,

33:21.959 --> 33:24.125
BUT MY ATTITUDE
ISN'T THE PROBLEM.

33:24.125 --> 33:27.708
YOURS IS, AND I EXPECT
TO SEE A CHANGE IN IT
SOON, VERY SOON.

33:27.708 --> 33:29.625
HERE. MAYBE THIS WILL HELP.
THANKS.

33:29.625 --> 33:31.458

33:31.458 --> 33:33.458

WHEN THIS COMES.

33:33.458 --> 33:34.542
WHAT, MY PAYCHECK?

33:34.542 --> 33:37.834
THANKS. NOT YOUR PAYCHECK,
WITTER, YOUR W-2.

33:37.834 --> 33:39.500
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE
WHAT'S IN THERE,

33:39.500 --> 33:43.166
BUT I'M GUESSING IT'S MORE
THAN THEY PAY FRY COOKS.

33:43.166 --> 33:45.333
LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE
ANY IDEA.

33:45.333 --> 33:48.166
HEY, ANYTIME YOU WANT
TO QUIT AND GO BACK
TO THE EASY LIFE,

33:48.166 --> 33:49.166

33:49.166 --> 33:50.250

AS YOU WORK HERE,

33:50.250 --> 33:52.542
THE ONLY LUNCHES YOU'RE
GOING TO BE GOING TO

33:52.542 --> 33:54.417

IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU'RE
ACTUALLY WORKING, HUH?

35:07.667 --> 35:10.959
THIS IS IT.

35:13.041 --> 35:16.708
I THOUGHT THE PHONES
WOULD RING A LITTLE MORE.

35:16.708 --> 35:18.542
WELL, IT DOESN'T
REALLY WORK LIKE THAT.

35:18.542 --> 35:19.458
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT.

35:19.458 --> 35:22.291
THINK ABOUT HOW STUBBORN
PEOPLE ARE,

35:22.291 --> 35:24.583
HOW HARD IT IS
FOR THEM TO ASK FOR HELP

35:24.583 --> 35:29.083
OR ACTUALLY
ADMIT THEY'RE WRONG
ABOUT SOMETHING.

35:29.083 --> 35:31.333
YEAH, YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

35:33.125 --> 35:34.250
LISTEN, C.J.--

35:34.250 --> 35:36.000
IT'S ALMOST 4:00.
CAFFEINE FIX?

35:36.000 --> 35:37.959
YOU'RE ASKING ME
IF I WANT COFFEE?

35:37.959 --> 35:40.458
YEAH. I'M JUST GONNA
GO OUT TO THE CART.

35:40.458 --> 35:43.959
OH, NO, NO.
NO, YOU'RE NOT
LEAVING ME HERE ALONE.

35:43.959 --> 35:46.250
YEAH, I AM.

35:46.250 --> 35:49.250
NO, YOU'RE NOT,
BECAUSE IF YOU LEAVE,

35:49.250 --> 35:51.041
THEN THE PHONE'LL
MOST CERTAINLY RING,

35:51.041 --> 35:53.875
AND IT'LL BE SOMEONE
ON THE OTHER END WHO WANTS
TO TALK TO SOMEBODY AND--

35:53.875 --> 35:56.041
YEAH. THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE HERE FOR.

35:56.041 --> 35:59.208
YEAH, EXCEPT YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
AND I DON'T,

35:59.208 --> 36:02.291
WHICH IS WHY
YOU SHOULDN'T GO.

36:02.291 --> 36:03.625
YOU KNOW,
A FEW DAYS AGO,

36:03.625 --> 36:05.375
YOU COULDN'T STAND
BEING IN THE SAME
ROOM WITH ME,

36:05.375 --> 36:08.208
AND NOW YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO LEAVE.

36:08.208 --> 36:11.166
THAT WAS A WEEK AGO.
CAN'T A PERSON CHANGE
IN A WEEK?

36:11.166 --> 36:12.333
I DON'T KNOW. CAN SHE?

36:14.166 --> 36:15.667
SURE YOU DON'T
WANT ANYTHING? NO?

36:15.667 --> 36:17.083
OK, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

DID THAT FUNDAMENTALLY

HEY, HEY, HEY, DAVID...
YEAH?

38:00.834 --> 38:03.000

38:34.000 --> 38:35.125
WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

38:35.125 --> 38:37.500
IT'S ABOUT A TEACHER

38:37.500 --> 38:38.333
WHO'S TRYING TO EXPLAIN
SOMETHING TO HIS STUDENTS.

38:38.333 --> 38:40.959

TRYING TO EXPLAIN?

38:40.959 --> 38:42.333

38:42.333 --> 38:43.834
WHY IS HE TRYING
TO EXPLAIN IT?

38:53.583 --> 38:58.041
ONE MINUTE, THEY'RE THERE.
THE NEXT MINUTE...

38:58.041 --> 39:02.250
THEY'RE GONE,
AND THE THING THAT'S TRUE,
THE PART OF IT THAT'S TRUE,

39:02.250 --> 39:04.417
THE PART OF IT THAT'S REAL,

39:04.417 --> 39:08.500
IS THAT NO ONE EVER DOES
EXPLAIN IT TO HIM BECAUSE...

39:08.500 --> 39:09.166
NO ONE CAN.

39:09.166 --> 39:10.959
THAT'S GREAT, JOEY.

39:14.750 --> 39:16.458
OF COURSE, YOU FORGOT
ALL ABOUT THE SNAKES
AND THE PUPPIES,

39:16.458 --> 39:18.125
BUT, OH, LOOK, WE'RE
OUT OF TIME FOR TODAY.

39:18.125 --> 39:20.583
MONDAY, EVERYONE,
SAUL BELLOW.

39:26.208 --> 39:27.500
GOT A SECOND, POTTER?

39:31.000 --> 39:32.375
WHAT'S THIS?

39:32.375 --> 39:33.875
THIS IS 50 BUCKS.

39:35.333 --> 39:36.542
OK, LOOK,
I KNOW YOU'RE POOR,

39:36.542 --> 39:37.542
BUT DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE SO POOR

39:37.542 --> 39:38.834
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN
50 BUCKS BEFORE.

39:38.834 --> 39:40.125
I DON'T GET IT.

39:40.125 --> 39:41.708
FOR TAKING CARE OF HARLEY
WHILE I WAS TEACHING YESTERDAY.

39:41.708 --> 39:45.625
SHE SAID THAT YOU
HELPED HER OUT WITH SOMETHING,

39:45.625 --> 39:49.667
SAID SHE WAS HAVING
SOME KIND OF A CRISIS.

39:49.667 --> 39:51.208
SHE  WAS
HAVING A CRISIS?

39:51.208 --> 39:52.708
YES, LOOK, JUST TAKE
THE MONEY, WILL YOU?

39:52.708 --> 39:54.875
IT'D BE A WHOLE LOT EASIER
FOR ME THAN TRYING
TO BE NICE TO YOU

39:54.875 --> 39:56.250
FOR THE REST OF
THE FRICKIN' SEMESTER.

39:56.250 --> 40:00.083
WAIT A SECOND.
WHY WOULD YOU BE
NICE TO ME? WHY?

40:00.083 --> 40:04.333
BECAUSE AS YOU POINTED OUT
THE OTHER DAY,

40:04.333 --> 40:06.166
THIS REALLY
ISN'T ABOUT ME.

40:09.208 --> 40:11.708
HER MOTHER'S GONE,
AND HER FATHER...

40:11.708 --> 40:14.291
IS A GIGANTIC
SCUZZBUCKET?

40:14.291 --> 40:16.375
YES, HE IS, ACTUALLY...

40:16.375 --> 40:18.667
MOST DAYS, ANYWAY,
ACCORDING TO HER.

40:18.667 --> 40:21.542
YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND,
SHE SEEMS TO LIKE.

40:21.542 --> 40:24.708
YEAH, WELL,
I'M VERY LIKABLE,

40:24.708 --> 40:26.333
BUT LIKABLE
AND POOR.

40:27.208 --> 40:29.000
$50, 3 TIMES A WEEK.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.667
65, AND I'LL HELP
THE LITTLE ANGEL
WITH HER HOMEWORK,

40:30.667 --> 40:33.458
NOT THAT SHE'D WANT HELP
FROM A "D" STUDENT.

40:33.458 --> 40:34.875
DEAL.

40:37.250 --> 40:38.250
HERE.

40:38.250 --> 40:39.125
WHAT'S THAT?

40:39.125 --> 40:41.208
50 BUCKS. NO CHARGE
FOR YESTERDAY.

40:41.208 --> 40:42.667
UH, LOOK, DON'T DO ME
ANY FAVORS, POTTER.

40:42.667 --> 40:46.250
I'M NOT. YOU WOULDN'T
UNDERSTAND, OK?

40:46.250 --> 40:48.291
WAS IT A GIRL THING
OR SOMETHING?

40:48.291 --> 40:51.291
NO, IT'S
A HUMAN-BEING THING.

40:56.750 --> 40:58.625
Todd: SO YOU FOUND ME
THEN, DID YA?

40:58.625 --> 40:59.917
CALLED THE SURF REPORT.

40:59.917 --> 41:02.417
THERE WERE ONLY SO MANY BEACHES
YOU COULD POSSIBLY BE AT.

41:02.417 --> 41:04.875
I CAN SEE I'M GONNA HAVE
TO GET ONE OF THOSE

41:04.875 --> 41:06.959
LITTLE MEN IN BLACK
DEALIES,

41:06.959 --> 41:09.834
DEPROGRAM YOU NOW THAT
OUR LONG ASSOCIATION
IS OVER.

41:09.834 --> 41:11.625
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS,
ISN'T IT?

41:11.625 --> 41:13.959
HAVING THAT MUCH
INFORMATION FLOATIN'
AROUND OUT THERE,

41:13.959 --> 41:16.458
EVERYBODY JUST WAITING
TO BE USED AGAINST YA?

41:16.458 --> 41:18.458
I CAME BY TO APOLOGIZE.

41:18.458 --> 41:21.166
FOR WHAT?
FOR STEALIN' ME JOB?

41:21.166 --> 41:23.875
LOOK, AFTER
YOU TOLD 'EM NO
YESTERDAY,

41:23.875 --> 41:25.458
LIKE THE BLOODY IDIOT
THAT YOU ARE,

41:25.458 --> 41:27.500
THEY CALLED ME.

41:27.500 --> 41:29.708
THEY EVEN APOLOGIZED,

41:29.708 --> 41:31.291
AS MUCH
AS THEY'RE CAPABLE OF.

41:31.291 --> 41:33.667
SO WHAT'S NEXT?
WE DO RESHOOTS HERE?
WE GO BACK TO BOSTON? WHAT?

41:33.667 --> 41:35.458
I'M SORRY, MATE.
YOU MISUNDERSTOOD ME.

41:35.458 --> 41:38.333
WE'RE  NOT
DOING ANYTHING.

41:38.333 --> 41:39.750
YOU ARE.

41:39.750 --> 41:41.959
WAIT A MINUTE. I'VE BEEN
THROUGH THIS BEFORE.
I'M NOT GONNA--

41:41.959 --> 41:43.125
NOT GONNA WHAT?

41:43.125 --> 41:45.667
NOT GONNA BENEFIT FROM
BEING AT THE RIGHT PLACE

41:45.667 --> 41:47.500
AT THE RIGHT TIME?

41:47.500 --> 41:48.708
THAT'S ALL IT IS,
YOU KNOW.

41:48.708 --> 41:51.708
DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE
ACTUALLY GOING PLACES

41:51.708 --> 41:53.166
OR THAT YOU'RE MORE
TALENTED THAN I AM,
YOU KNOW. I MEAN--

41:53.166 --> 41:55.417
GOD, NO. YOU'RE LIKE...

41:56.875 --> 42:00.208
BARELY FUNCTIONAL,
BUT YOU'RE...

42:00.208 --> 42:01.875
LIKE MY MENTOR.

42:03.375 --> 42:05.959
WHAT, NOT
STEVEN BLOODY SPIELBERG?

42:05.959 --> 42:07.166
WELL, HE...

42:07.166 --> 42:09.000
HASN'T BEEN RETURNING
MY PHONE CALLS.

42:09.000 --> 42:13.417
JUST DON'T MAKE IT
ANY WORSE, OK?

42:13.417 --> 42:16.333
AND LISTEN,
THE ABSOLUTE FIRST THING

42:16.333 --> 42:19.333
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER
TO DO WHEN YOU'RE ON SET

42:19.333 --> 42:20.792
IS TAKE A PICTURE
OF NATASHA'S FACE

42:20.792 --> 42:25.125
AT THE EXACT MOMENT
THAT SHE'S INTRODUCED
TO HER NEW DIRECTOR...

42:25.125 --> 42:27.625
'CAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING
I BLOODY WELL HAVE TO SEE.

42:32.041 --> 42:33.041
COME IN.
