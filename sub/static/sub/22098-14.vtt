both came back alive, all right?

That's just it, Kara.

01:15.659 --> 01:18.161

you were still asleep.

After the last few weeks, it
just feels good to be on my feet.

02:34.613 --> 02:36.030
Thank you, though.

02:39.284 --> 02:42.119
You've made a remarkable
recovery, Madam President.

02:42.204 --> 02:45.373
Remarkable indeed.
But now I'm playing catch-up.

02:45.457 --> 02:48.417
I'm afraid during my illness I
lost focus. I let some things slide.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.169
Well, that's behind us now.

02:50.254 --> 02:55.341
Yes, it is. To the point. Supplies are
running low and the people are worried.

02:55.425 --> 02:56.717
FISK: Well, they wouldn't
be civilians

02:56.802 --> 02:58.678
if they didn't have
something to bitch about.

02:58.762 --> 03:01.222
ROSLIN: Well, I think that in
this case, they're entitled.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.308
Our inventory levels are
tight, but they're not critical.

03:04.393 --> 03:05.810
But all the way
across the fleet,

03:05.894 --> 03:07.937
people are reporting
shortages of essential goods,

03:08.021 --> 03:10.481
and what they do get
comes at a high price.

03:10.566 --> 03:12.775
They're turning
to the black market.

03:14.528 --> 03:17.446
Last week, one of my aides
came down with pneumonia.

03:17.531 --> 03:20.575
Billy had to trade liquor
to get the antibiotics.

03:21.535 --> 03:24.829
It's the nature of the beast.
People want what they want.

03:25.998 --> 03:29.959
A few trades would be one thing,
Commander Fisk. That's reality.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.419
But I'm talking
about criminals

03:31.503 --> 03:33.045
making outrageous demands
on the people.

03:33.130 --> 03:37.300
So, bottom line is, I'm implementing
a new, fleet-wide trade policy.

03:37.676 --> 03:42.722
We need to be in control of our
supply chain, not black market thugs.

03:43.015 --> 03:46.559
I am hoping that I can have
the military's support on this.

03:46.643 --> 03:51.522
Admiral, if you want Pegasus to run these
dogs down, you just give us the word.

03:54.318 --> 03:57.987
Our people will do whatever it
takes to get this under control.

03:58.447 --> 04:01.073
And it's good to have
you back, Madam President.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.951
It's good to be back.

to have invigorated her somewhat.

04:18.967 --> 04:20.718
Yeah, well,
maybe too much.

04:20.802 --> 04:23.346
She doesn't really think her
made-up plans and regulations

04:23.430 --> 04:24.805
are gonna change anything,
does she?

04:24.890 --> 04:26.599
As if we don't have
enough to do.

04:26.683 --> 04:29.268
No, Madam President sets a
great prestige by her office

04:29.353 --> 04:30.853
and Adama supports her,
at least for the moment.

had some reservations.

I'll bet.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.498
You must have known
she was trading with Fisk.

17:25.253 --> 17:27.129
Well, maybe I'll talk to her.

17:27.213 --> 17:31.717
She didn't give it to Fisk. I did.
I traded it for a few necessities,

17:31.801 --> 17:35.470
a couple of things to help
her get by. Big frakking deal.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.389
There's nothing illegal
about that.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.557
Not yet.

17:38.641 --> 17:42.102
Don't you play
holier-than-thou with me.

17:42.645 --> 17:46.189
I haven't done anything that most
people on this ship haven't done.

17:46.941 --> 17:48.191

18:06.335 --> 18:07.669

18:07.754 --> 18:09.796

18:43.456 --> 18:46.708
Anyway, I'm not sure you need
me holding your hand anymore.

18:47.168 --> 18:50.378
Was that what you were doing?
Holding my hand?

18:50.588 --> 18:51.671
(CHUCKLES)

18:52.423 --> 18:54.216
I meant it as a compliment.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.011
Permission
to speak frankly, sir?

18:58.971 --> 19:02.224
You don't need my permission
and you don't need the "sir. "

19:06.395 --> 19:10.232
Maybe that's the problem. I don't
really know what to think anymore.

19:10.566 --> 19:14.361
So I'll just ask.
Is this going somewhere?

19:14.445 --> 19:15.487

don't know what I'm talking about.

together, our workouts.

19:22.245 --> 19:24.162
Something's changed
between us.

19:36.050 --> 19:38.468

what you want me to say.

20:12.461 --> 20:16.256

What did they do?

20:17.967 --> 20:20.260
They said they knew
about you and me.

20:20.344 --> 20:23.054
They wanted to know
what we've been talking about.

20:23.139 --> 20:25.473
Lee, I don't understand
why they'd care.

20:25.558 --> 20:29.978

taking you and Paya back to Galactica.

I can keep you safe.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.321

tell them about us?

I hear any more talk
about Fisk,

21:34.210 --> 21:37.671
I'm going to send your whore
back to you piece by piece.

21:37.755 --> 21:40.298
And then I'm gonna start
on the little girl.

21:40.633 --> 21:44.302
I know who you are,
I know whose son you are.

21:46.097 --> 21:47.764
And I don't care.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.558
You tell Adama to let it go.

22:15.084 --> 22:17.460
Is that when you knew
that you loved her?

22:18.295 --> 22:19.838
I thought so.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.759

22:54.915 --> 22:56.750
This is Captain Adama.

22:56.834 --> 23:00.128
I need a medic and a
security team on L Deck asap.

23:12.892 --> 23:15.143
You wanted to see me,
Madam President?

23:15.352 --> 23:16.478
Yes.

23:17.563 --> 23:19.481
Thank you for coming, Doctor.

23:20.816 --> 23:22.192
Have a seat.

23:27.281 --> 23:29.324
Would you like some tea?

23:29.825 --> 23:31.034
I'd love one.

23:35.498 --> 23:40.001
You know, I'm never quite sure where
we stand with each other, Doctor.

23:44.548 --> 23:46.299
Why do you think that is?

23:47.718 --> 23:49.219
I can't imagine why.

23:50.137 --> 23:54.474
I've never had anything but the
utmost respect for you and your office.

23:56.310 --> 23:58.770
I understand that you and
Commander Fisk planned to meet

23:58.854 --> 24:00.563
just prior to his death.

24:08.614 --> 24:11.116
As I have already explained
to Captain Adama,

24:11.951 --> 24:15.745
Commander Fisk had several lingering
concerns about your new trade policy.

24:15.830 --> 24:17.080
What can I say?

24:18.207 --> 24:19.707
And that's it?

24:19.792 --> 24:22.252
NO. 6: Gaius,
she's afraid of you.

24:22.378 --> 24:23.586
Why

24:24.463 --> 24:26.631
are you asking me this?

24:27.716 --> 24:30.218
You saved my life
and I'm grateful.

24:31.512 --> 24:34.806
But I sense that there is
some unease in you

24:34.890 --> 24:37.308
about assuming the presidency

24:37.393 --> 24:39.811
and I'd like
to offer you an out.

24:45.359 --> 24:46.401
You what?

24:46.485 --> 24:47.735
Resign.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.239
Return to your scientific
work on Galactica.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.825
No one will question
your motives,

24:54.827 --> 24:59.205
and you can consider it a second
chance like the one you gave me.

25:01.584 --> 25:02.876
Charming.

25:04.211 --> 25:05.420
Doctor,

25:10.134 --> 25:12.093
this is a one-time offer.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.762
I suggest you reconsider.

25:15.472 --> 25:19.642
You know, Madam President, I've never
been particularly interested in politics

25:20.686 --> 25:23.396
and I never wanted
any lofty position of power.

25:24.064 --> 25:26.441
I never wanted to be
the Vice President.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.111
That is,
until this very moment.

25:30.613 --> 25:34.616
Because right now, I can't
think of anything I want more.

25:44.752 --> 25:47.462
One to the head.
You didn't do this?

25:49.632 --> 25:52.425
I was attacked. I found
him there when I woke up.

25:52.509 --> 25:56.346
Security bulletin said Commander
Fisk was garroted with a wire.

25:56.430 --> 25:59.224
Whatever happened,
looks like you found your guy.

25:59.934 --> 26:02.227
What about Shevon,
and her daughter?

26:02.311 --> 26:05.647
Cloud 9's an open port. Chances
are they're already off-ship.

26:06.357 --> 26:08.107
I'll get a team down here.

26:09.235 --> 26:10.610

26:11.695 --> 26:14.864
Lee. I just heard.
Are you all right?

26:16.283 --> 26:17.659
What are you doing here?

26:17.743 --> 26:19.535
Attending a Quorum meeting.

26:20.329 --> 26:23.414
Nothing as exciting
as all this, I assure you.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.833
I know these places
are legal, but still,

26:25.918 --> 26:28.002
the son of the almighty Adama?

26:29.088 --> 26:30.922
Talk to me
about the black market.

26:31.006 --> 26:32.090
(ZAREK CHUCKLES)

26:32.174 --> 26:35.260
Not much to say.
It's widespread, inevitable,

26:35.344 --> 26:38.513
and according to
President Roslin, illegal.

26:39.014 --> 26:42.600
So it's no surprise that you and
Fisk were in it up to your necks.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.978
Fisk, maybe, but not me.

26:45.354 --> 26:49.649
I represent Astral Queen. Have to
be careful about the company I keep.

26:51.860 --> 26:53.278
This is Fisk's log.

26:56.031 --> 27:00.618
He says he made three runs to
Astral Queen in the last 10 days

27:00.703 --> 27:02.954
and I doubt it was to
discuss prison reform.

27:03.038 --> 27:05.123
What do you want
from me, Captain?

27:06.625 --> 27:08.793
Names of ships. Contacts.

27:09.545 --> 27:10.878
I can't help you.

27:16.218 --> 27:18.386
Why do you think
Fisk approached me?

27:18.554 --> 27:22.140
To get a piece of your black market
scam. To offer you protection.

27:23.642 --> 27:27.020
You and your father are both
so blinded by the past.

27:29.648 --> 27:33.359
Fisk's black market was up and
running when he approached me.

27:34.653 --> 27:37.405
He knew Adama would pick up
on his unauthorized shuttles,

27:37.489 --> 27:40.783
so he tried to force me into
taking over the deliveries,

27:40.868 --> 27:44.787
creating a firewall between
Pegasus and the illegal shipments.

27:45.956 --> 27:48.916
So you're trying to tell me
that you turned him down?

27:49.626 --> 27:50.960
At great cost.

27:51.962 --> 27:53.629
Check the fleet logs,

27:53.714 --> 27:57.967
see how many supply ships made stops at
the Astral Queen after Fisk's last trip.

27:58.052 --> 27:59.218
The answer is none.

27:59.303 --> 28:01.721
So if Fisk was
trying to starve you out,

28:02.056 --> 28:04.307
why didn't you bring it
to the Quorum?

28:05.225 --> 28:09.228
Roslin's acting like the black
market's some sort of aberration,

28:09.563 --> 28:11.939
but I thought
you were smarter than that.

28:13.567 --> 28:15.276
Did you really expect

28:16.987 --> 28:20.365
some utopian fantasy
to rise from the ashes?

28:28.957 --> 28:31.125
ZAREK: I heard
the security officer.

28:32.795 --> 28:35.922

for a reason.

a way out.

seemed reasonable.

37:09.853 --> 37:11.312
You're not gonna...

(MUMBLING)

37:20.572 --> 37:21.989
(GASPING)

37:38.548 --> 37:40.466
APOLLO: All right, it's done.

37:53.313 --> 37:55.898
The fleet relies
on the black market.

37:56.942 --> 37:59.443
Much as we'd like,
we can't wish that away.

38:01.696 --> 38:03.530
So you're still in business.

38:05.575 --> 38:06.867
For now.

38:08.161 --> 38:10.287
But if there are
any more killings,

38:10.413 --> 38:12.623
if you hold back
essential medicines,

38:14.376 --> 38:16.919
if you ever touch a child...

38:27.597 --> 38:28.722
Shevon...

38:28.807 --> 38:29.848
No, I don't want...

38:29.933 --> 38:32.309
Hey, hey, it's over. It's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay...

38:32.394 --> 38:34.645
Lee, Lee, no.
Hey. Shevon, it's over.

38:34.729 --> 38:35.896
Stop.

38:38.024 --> 38:40.401
I can't be
what you want me to be.

38:41.820 --> 38:44.154
I don't want you
to be anything.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.743
You want me to be her.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.206
(SNIFFLING)

38:57.085 --> 38:58.836
That's what this is about.

39:00.255 --> 39:02.548
That's what
this has always been about.

39:03.258 --> 39:07.261
No. That's not what
this has ever been about.

39:07.971 --> 39:10.139
Come on, Lee.
I know my job.

39:13.101 --> 39:14.727
I'm a replacement.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.438
For a lot of things.

39:19.232 --> 39:21.567
Things that men
can't get anywhere else.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.695
SHEVON: Things they've lost.

39:27.157 --> 39:29.575
She wanted
to give you a child.

39:37.042 --> 39:38.625
But you were afraid,

39:39.210 --> 39:43.047
so you pushed her away
and then you ran,

39:43.631 --> 39:46.842
and you didn't stop running
until it was too late.

39:59.981 --> 40:01.940
Well, I'm not her.

40:03.151 --> 40:06.445
And Paya is not, and
will never be, your child.

40:21.711 --> 40:23.879
APOLLO: Commander Fisk's
murder has been resolved

40:23.963 --> 40:27.758
and Pegasus' crew appears to have
accepted Galactica's conclusions.

40:29.677 --> 40:31.512
That's all,
Madam President.

40:33.598 --> 40:37.101
Not quite. What about
this ship Prometheus?

40:37.602 --> 40:41.021
I understand it's the hub
of the fleet's black market.

40:41.981 --> 40:43.816
We will keep an eye on them.

40:44.818 --> 40:46.318
Keep an eye on them.

40:46.694 --> 40:49.363
That's not exactly
the solution I had in mind.

40:50.615 --> 40:53.742
Whether or not we allow a criminal
enterprise to thrive in this fleet

40:53.827 --> 40:56.036
is not a matter of choice,
Captain.

40:59.249 --> 41:00.541
Admiral?

41:01.292 --> 41:03.627
I've given Lee
full authority on this issue.

41:03.711 --> 41:05.212
The decision is his.

41:07.966 --> 41:11.844
I support your trade policies
wholeheartedly, Madam President,

41:12.554 --> 41:14.638
but we are never gonna have
a perfect system.

41:14.722 --> 41:17.391
There will always be
some kind of black market.

41:18.059 --> 41:21.895
At least this way I know names, I
know faces, I know where they are

41:21.980 --> 41:24.481
and we will monitor
the situation.

41:28.111 --> 41:30.070
Thank you, gentlemen,
I'm busy.

41:34.909 --> 41:36.410
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

41:48.089 --> 41:50.924
BILLY: Eighteen. I'm starting
to sweat here. Nineteen...

41:51.009 --> 41:52.176
You should be sweating.
Twenty...

41:52.260 --> 41:53.594
Why aren't you doing
any of these?

41:53.678 --> 41:55.345
No talking, no talking,
please.

41:55.430 --> 41:58.056
No cheating.
Hold it up, a little higher.

41:58.141 --> 41:59.391
(CHUCKLING)

42:00.185 --> 42:02.728
Sneaky.
Eight, nine...

42:03.688 --> 42:04.855
Start again.
You aren't serious.

42:04.939 --> 42:06.231
Zero...

42:09.736 --> 42:11.069
Well? No?

42:13.198 --> 42:15.616
President wasn't
very happy today.

42:15.950 --> 42:17.117
No.

42:22.040 --> 42:25.792
Ever since you ejected from the
Blackbird, you've been different.

42:28.504 --> 42:30.088
Harder to reach.

42:31.674 --> 42:34.134
I'm just trying to understand.

42:36.638 --> 42:40.974
Well, like you said, Dad,
we've all been through a lot.

42:43.436 --> 42:44.686
Fair enough.

42:47.106 --> 42:49.650
But you should have told me
about the woman.
