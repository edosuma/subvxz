WEBVTT

00:02.668 --> 00:03.501
- Bugs bunny.

00:03.503 --> 00:05.937
I have an appointment
with dr. Weisberg.

00:05.939 --> 00:09.574
- Go ahead and take a seat.

00:10.009 --> 00:11.810
- Daffy?

00:11.812 --> 00:13.011
- Oh, hey, bugs.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.413
- What are you doing here?

00:15.415 --> 00:16.181
- Reading.

00:16.183 --> 00:17.482
My subscription ran out.

00:17.484 --> 00:19.484
- So you come to
a doctor's office?

00:19.552 --> 00:22.987
- No, I come to a doctor's
office waiting room.

00:22.989 --> 00:24.055
It's very pleasant.

00:24.057 --> 00:28.426
Fish tank, classical music.
Very nice.

00:28.428 --> 00:30.829
- Someone order
chinese food?

00:30.831 --> 00:32.964
- Right here.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074

[heart thumping]

00:53.687 --> 00:57.956
- You got any sodas in here?
- Shh.

00:58.257 --> 01:01.926
- Wow. This thing's like
a runaway freight train.

01:01.928 --> 01:03.828
What are you
so hopped up for?

01:03.830 --> 01:06.564
- I'm always telling him
he's too stressed.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.633
- I'm not stressed.

01:08.635 --> 01:10.135
- Here's what
we're gonna do.

01:10.137 --> 01:12.771
I want you to spend
the weekend relaxing.

01:12.773 --> 01:15.707
Lots of deep breathing.
No excitement.

01:15.709 --> 01:16.441
No stress.

01:16.443 --> 01:20.211
We'll check your heart
again on Monday.

01:20.213 --> 01:22.213
- It's weird. I feel fine.

01:22.215 --> 01:24.048
- Oh, hey, doc, I have
a quick question for you.

01:24.050 --> 01:28.052
Is there anything you can do
to stretch my stomach
10 times its size?

01:28.220 --> 01:30.388
- What are you, crazy?

01:30.390 --> 01:33.291
I'm gonna be in a hot dog
eating contest

01:33.293 --> 01:34.325
At the fair this weekend.

01:34.327 --> 01:36.261
- Oh, I forgot the fair
was this weekend.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.630
- Bup bup bup.
No fair for you.

01:38.632 --> 01:41.332
That's too much
excitement.

01:41.334 --> 01:43.468
But for me, I can't wait.

01:43.470 --> 01:44.502
I go every year.

01:44.504 --> 01:48.006
I like to win all that stuff
nobody needs.

01:48.008 --> 01:52.143
A kazoo, novelty glasses.

01:53.479 --> 01:55.847
Silly straw.

01:56.448 --> 01:58.516
Snap pops.

01:58.584 --> 02:00.418
[popping]
- aah!

02:00.420 --> 02:01.920
- Oh, sorry.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.555
[heart thumping]

02:03.557 --> 02:05.290
- So, what about my stomach?

02:05.292 --> 02:07.959
- You shouldn't enter
that contest.

02:07.961 --> 02:12.363
Binge eating
is extremely unhealthy.

02:13.465 --> 02:14.966
[ding]

02:14.968 --> 02:18.603
- Well, if I can't stretch
my stomach with surgery,

02:18.605 --> 02:21.706
I'm gonna have to do it
the old-fashioned way--

02:21.708 --> 02:22.974
By gorging myself.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.776
- You're not gonna listen
to your doctor?

02:24.778 --> 02:26.211
- He's not my doctor,
he's yours.

02:26.213 --> 02:29.447
Sure, I've gone to him
for the occasional
cosmetic procedure,

02:29.449 --> 02:31.449
But even then, I had him
send you the bill.

02:31.451 --> 02:34.052
- Why do you want to win
a hot dog eating contest?

02:34.054 --> 02:37.622
- That is the dumbest question
I have ever heard in my life.

02:37.624 --> 02:40.425
How about a lifetime
supply of hot dogs,

02:40.427 --> 02:42.327
A custom-made satin jacket,

02:42.329 --> 02:44.495
And for one year,
the great honor

02:44.497 --> 02:46.564
Of being called
mr. Wiener.

02:46.566 --> 02:49.067
Does that answer
your question?

02:49.069 --> 02:50.268
- No.

02:50.270 --> 02:52.570
[elevator dings]

02:52.972 --> 02:54.405
- Here, let me drive you home.

02:54.407 --> 02:55.607
That way you can relax.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.041
- What about your car?

02:57.043 --> 02:57.876
- Oh, it got towed.

02:57.878 --> 03:02.313
I parked in
dr. Weisberg's spot.

03:03.482 --> 03:08.152
- The funny thing is,
I really don't feel
stressed at all.

03:08.154 --> 03:10.521
[tires squeal]

03:10.523 --> 03:13.224
- What is the matter
with you?!

03:13.226 --> 03:14.959
That light was yellow!

03:14.961 --> 03:17.695
You go on yellow!
- Daffy.

03:17.697 --> 03:21.332
- My friend could have
a heart attack at any second!

03:21.334 --> 03:25.169
I'm trying to keep
things calm for him!

03:25.171 --> 03:27.038
- Back off!
- Oh, boy.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.973
- You want to fight?

03:29.675 --> 03:31.876
Oh, he wants to fight.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.211
[tires squeal]

03:33.213 --> 03:35.013
[horn honks]

03:35.147 --> 03:37.215
Stay calm, bugs,
I got this.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.918
Just do some of that
deep breathing.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.521
- [stammering]
where's bugs?

03:43.523 --> 03:45.156
- He said he needed
to lie down.

03:45.158 --> 03:47.825
He's such a frail reed,
that guy.

03:47.827 --> 03:49.560
- Hello.
What can I get you?

03:49.562 --> 03:51.262
- I'll have 62 hot dogs.

03:51.264 --> 03:52.063
- Say what?

03:52.065 --> 03:55.099
- That's one more than
last year's winner ate.

03:55.101 --> 03:56.034
Well, not this year.

03:56.036 --> 03:59.304
Soon you'll be calling me
mr. Wiener.

03:59.306 --> 04:01.639
- I already call you that.
And a lot worse.

04:01.641 --> 04:03.775
How about you, porky?
- Oh, I'm not eating.

04:03.777 --> 04:06.911
- Wow! That's one thing I
thought I'd never hear you say.

04:06.913 --> 04:10.915
- I'm too nervous.
My girlfriend's coming to town.

04:10.917 --> 04:11.983
- Ok, now that's two things

04:11.985 --> 04:13.284
I thought I'd
never hear you say.

04:13.286 --> 04:15.486
- Well, she's sort of
my girlfriend.

04:15.488 --> 04:16.954
We've only met once.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.023
But we talk on the phone
every day.

04:19.024 --> 04:21.492
And tomorrow she's
coming into town

04:21.494 --> 04:23.127
To go to the fair with me.

04:23.129 --> 04:24.896
[sighs]
she's wonderful.

04:24.898 --> 04:28.766
I get butterflies
in my stomach just
thinking about her.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.969
- Uh, I know what I would
like in my stomach--

04:30.971 --> 04:33.938
62 hot dogs.
So arriba, arriba.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.740
- That's too much food, man.

04:35.742 --> 04:37.275
- I gotta stretch
my stomach.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.143
- Do you know how bad
that is for you?

04:39.145 --> 04:40.011
62 hot dogs.

04:40.013 --> 04:43.614
Eating that much
in one sitting could kill you.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.383
Coming right up.

04:45.385 --> 04:50.021
- Oh, petunia will be here
in 22 hours, 38 minutes,

04:50.023 --> 04:51.222
And 14 seconds.

04:51.224 --> 04:52.490
- You're gonna blow it.

04:52.492 --> 04:54.258
- Wh-what do you mean?

04:54.260 --> 04:55.126
- You're too eager.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.561
You're gonna
scare her off.

04:56.563 --> 04:58.129
You gotta relax, chill.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.798
Otherwise she's gonna
think you're desperate.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.767
Girls like a guy
who plays it cool.

05:02.769 --> 05:06.537
[cell phone rings]

05:06.539 --> 05:07.472
Watch this.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.374
Hey, tina, you're gonna
have to call me back.

05:09.376 --> 05:10.842
I'm in the middle
of something, ok?

05:10.844 --> 05:12.643
So maybe I'll see you
later, maybe I won't.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.412
So whatever.
Doesn't matter either way.

05:14.414 --> 05:17.081
- You better see me later.
We have a date tonight

05:17.083 --> 05:19.884
And you're picking me up
at 8:30. Got it?

05:20.519 --> 05:22.520
- Well, whatever you say,
my angel.

05:22.522 --> 05:25.089
I'll be counting
the seconds.

05:25.091 --> 05:29.694
I'm telling you, porky,
play it cool.

05:29.828 --> 05:31.796
Whoa! That's a lot
of hot dogs.

05:31.798 --> 05:33.197
How can someone
eat that many?

05:33.199 --> 05:35.700
- What's the most
you've ever eaten?

05:35.702 --> 05:36.934
- I don't know.
4, 4 1/2.

05:36.936 --> 05:39.303
Any more than that,
they start coming back up,

05:39.305 --> 05:40.371
If you know what I mean.

05:40.373 --> 05:43.341
- Unfortunately, we always
know what you mean.

05:43.343 --> 05:46.110
- Well, here goes nothing.

05:46.112 --> 05:50.281
[chewing noisily]

05:51.917 --> 05:53.584
[gulp]

05:53.586 --> 05:56.754
[slurping and grunting]

05:56.756 --> 05:59.857
[muttering and chewing]

05:59.859 --> 06:01.025
Ooh...[burps]

06:01.027 --> 06:02.860
How many was that?

06:02.862 --> 06:04.662
- 4.

06:04.664 --> 06:06.130
- [groans] 4. Well,

06:06.132 --> 06:08.833
Maybe I could do another half.

06:08.835 --> 06:10.535
[snarf, munch]

06:10.537 --> 06:12.270
[gulp] uhh.

06:12.272 --> 06:14.072
[retching]

06:14.074 --> 06:15.673
It's comin' back up!

06:15.675 --> 06:17.708
It's comin' back up!

06:17.710 --> 06:20.878
[music plays]

06:25.017 --> 06:27.151
[soothing music playing]

06:27.153 --> 06:28.052
[heart beating fast]

06:28.054 --> 06:29.754
- It's still beating
like crazy.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.022
What is the matter with me?

06:31.024 --> 06:34.158
[loud buzzing]
aah!

06:37.262 --> 06:40.331
What on earth
are you doing?!

06:40.333 --> 06:41.899
- I'm building a ramp.

06:41.901 --> 06:42.900
- For what?

06:42.902 --> 06:44.869
- I'm performing
a death-defying stunt

06:44.871 --> 06:46.304
At this weekend's fair.

06:46.306 --> 06:50.208
- Are you, uh, qualified
for that sort of thing?

06:50.210 --> 06:52.510
- Nope. But it don't matter.

06:52.512 --> 06:55.012
It's my legacy.

06:55.014 --> 06:57.882
It all started with
my great-granddaddy,

06:57.884 --> 06:59.584
Rocky mountain sam.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.453
He once jumped
a horse-drawed carriage

07:02.455 --> 07:04.689
Over 15 cows.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.557
Then there was old grand-dad,

07:06.559 --> 07:07.925
Death valley sam.

07:07.927 --> 07:12.063
He jumped a model t
over 15 model ls.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.764
- O...K.

07:13.766 --> 07:14.465
[clank]

07:14.467 --> 07:16.200
- Then there was my daddy,

07:16.202 --> 07:17.835
Grand canyon sam.

07:17.837 --> 07:21.439
Some say he was the greatest
daredevil of 'em all.

07:21.441 --> 07:25.743
He jumped a motorcycle
over 15 school buses.

07:25.745 --> 07:30.982
- You gonna jump a motorcycle
over a bunch of school buses?

07:31.049 --> 07:34.018
- No. I'm a-gonna jump
a school bus

07:34.020 --> 07:38.022
Over a bunch of motorcycles.

07:38.024 --> 07:39.757
- Eh...Good luck with that.

07:39.759 --> 07:43.060
- Will you help me? Please?

07:43.062 --> 07:45.129
I don't know how
to build a ramp.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.864
I ain't never done a stunt.

07:46.866 --> 07:48.432
I'm not a daredevil.

07:48.434 --> 07:49.834
- Then don't do it.

07:49.836 --> 07:50.801
- I gots to.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.537
Because I can't
go down in history

07:52.539 --> 07:55.806
As the only sam
who never jumped one thing

07:55.808 --> 07:58.042
Over a bunch
of other things.

07:58.044 --> 07:59.310
- I'd love to help you,

07:59.312 --> 08:02.580
But I'm under doctor's orders
to take it easy this weekend.

08:02.582 --> 08:04.448
- I'm not asking you
to do the stunt,

08:04.450 --> 08:08.119
I'm just asking you
to figure out
how to do the stunt.

08:08.121 --> 08:11.455
- [sighs] so you want
to jump a school bus

08:11.457 --> 08:13.691
Over how many motorcycles?

08:13.693 --> 08:18.429
- Right. I think we're
gonna need a calculator.

08:18.431 --> 08:19.597
- A calculator?!

08:19.599 --> 08:21.632
I said a school bus!

08:21.634 --> 08:24.769
Whoa! Oof!

08:24.771 --> 08:26.871
[creaking, rumbling]

08:26.873 --> 08:29.340
Ohh!

08:33.010 --> 08:36.080
- [munching]

08:36.082 --> 08:37.982
[gulp] yes!

08:37.984 --> 08:39.750
5 hot dogs.

08:39.751 --> 08:42.486
And they're staying down.

08:42.488 --> 08:43.486
- They'd better.

08:43.489 --> 08:44.622
- Well, all I have to do now

08:44.624 --> 08:48.259
Is figure out how I'm going
to cram 57 more down my gullet.

08:48.261 --> 08:49.894
I gotta stretch this dude out.

08:49.896 --> 08:53.231
- I can't believe
you're doing all this
for a stupid satin jacket

08:53.233 --> 08:54.899
And so people will call you
mr. Wiener.

08:54.901 --> 08:58.636
- Well, truth be told,
there's another reason.

08:58.638 --> 09:01.005
It's my legacy.

09:01.007 --> 09:04.809
It all started with
my great-grandfather
dipsy duck.

09:04.811 --> 09:09.213
He ate 54 huckleberry pies
in a pie-eating contest

09:09.215 --> 09:12.984
And won a horse-drawn carriage.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.319
Then there was
my grandfather doofus duck.

09:15.321 --> 09:20.958
He ate 112 corncobs
in a corncob-eating contest

09:20.960 --> 09:23.461
And won a model t.

09:23.629 --> 09:26.897
And then there was
my father, dummy duck.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.267
He ate 14 buckets
of fried chicken

09:29.269 --> 09:31.469
In a fried
chicken-eating contest

09:31.471 --> 09:33.437
And won a school bus.

09:33.439 --> 09:35.706
He still drives it
to this day.

09:35.708 --> 09:38.442
Now do you understand
why I have to win?

09:38.444 --> 09:43.047
- Do any of the guys
in your family
have normal names,

09:43.049 --> 09:44.649
Like david or doug?

09:44.651 --> 09:47.685
- I have a cousin
named dimwit duck.

09:47.687 --> 09:50.454
Look, tina, the point is,
I have to win

09:50.456 --> 09:51.689
So I don't go down
in history

09:51.691 --> 09:54.158
As the only duck
who didn't win a contest

09:54.160 --> 09:56.460
By gorging himself
on carnival food.

09:56.462 --> 10:01.232
And also I really want
that satin jacket.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.100
[sighs]

10:03.102 --> 10:05.102
[munching, chewing]

10:05.104 --> 10:06.137
[gulp]

10:06.139 --> 10:07.705
[retching]

10:07.707 --> 10:09.707
Bllucch!

10:09.709 --> 10:13.644
[drumroll, flourish]

10:14.379 --> 10:16.380
- What are we doin'
playin' with models?

10:16.382 --> 10:18.049
We oughta be building
the real thing.

10:18.051 --> 10:21.852
- I told you, I don't
want anything to do
with the real thing.

10:21.854 --> 10:24.455
My heart is racing
just thinking about it.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.990
[heart racing]

10:25.992 --> 10:27.158
I need to relax.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.759
- Why do you need to relax?

10:28.761 --> 10:30.294
Your life ain't stressful.

10:30.296 --> 10:31.862
Near as I can tell,
you sit around

10:31.864 --> 10:34.565
In a big house all day
doing nothin'.

10:34.567 --> 10:38.069
[classical music playing]

10:40.272 --> 10:46.177
- Ok. Your school bus weighs
approximately 14,000 pounds.

10:46.179 --> 10:49.246
And this ramp is at
an angle of 22 degrees.

10:49.248 --> 10:53.851
So, you need to be going
no less than 89 miles per hour,

10:53.853 --> 10:56.887
But no more than
91 miles per hour
when you hit the ramp

10:56.889 --> 11:01.125
So that you can travel
the 72 feet over
the 15 motorcycles.

11:01.127 --> 11:06.030
Now, you have to land
exactly on the front edge

11:06.032 --> 11:07.031
Of the landing ramp,

11:07.033 --> 11:09.800
Otherwise you lose
control and crash.

11:09.802 --> 11:11.335
So, 89 miles per hour,

11:11.337 --> 11:13.337
22-degree takeoff,
72 feet,

11:13.339 --> 11:16.374
Land on the front edge
of the ramp. Got it?

11:16.376 --> 11:19.276
- [snoring]

11:19.278 --> 11:21.212
- Yosemite!

11:21.214 --> 11:22.513
- Huh? What?

11:22.515 --> 11:23.414
Uh, sorry.

11:23.416 --> 11:27.585
That classical music's
just so dang relaxing.

11:27.587 --> 11:29.453
[airplane]

11:29.455 --> 11:31.622
[cell phone rings]

11:31.624 --> 11:34.325
- [muffled]
hey. I just wanted
to remind you

11:34.327 --> 11:36.961
To play it cool
with petunia.

11:36.963 --> 11:37.928
- What?

11:37.930 --> 11:39.797
- Oh, sorry.
I was eating.

11:39.799 --> 11:42.199
I'm up to 7 hot dogs.

11:44.336 --> 11:48.005
I just want to remind you
to play it cool with petunia.

11:48.007 --> 11:49.673
- Oh. Right.

11:49.675 --> 11:51.375
- Porky, I am serious.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.644
Serious like a heart attack.

11:53.646 --> 11:55.813
Sorry, bugs.

11:55.815 --> 11:56.881
You cannot blow this.

11:56.883 --> 12:00.418
Remember, you come from
a long line of pigs

12:00.420 --> 12:03.154
Who have blown it.
Need I remind you

12:03.156 --> 12:05.689
Of your great-grandfather
pudgy pig,

12:05.691 --> 12:08.092
Your grandfather,
plumpy pig,

12:08.094 --> 12:10.528
And your father,
plus-size pig.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.496
- You know,
my dad's name is alan.

12:12.498 --> 12:14.632
- The point is,
they all blew it.

12:14.634 --> 12:16.734
You gotta break
the chain, porky.

12:16.736 --> 12:17.668
Play it cool.

12:17.670 --> 12:20.971
Unless you want to lose
petunia forever.

12:20.973 --> 12:23.474
- Uh--she's here!

12:23.476 --> 12:24.308
[beep]

12:24.310 --> 12:25.509
- Good. I gotta go anyway.

12:25.511 --> 12:27.044
That's tina
on the other line.

12:27.046 --> 12:31.081
Oh, darling I hope
I didn't keep you waiting.

12:31.917 --> 12:36.187
You're gonna blow it.
Play it cool.

12:36.189 --> 12:39.023
- Oh! Porky,
it's so good to see you.

12:39.025 --> 12:43.093
I'm so excited for our weekend!

12:43.095 --> 12:46.330
- Ok, cool.

12:52.838 --> 12:55.706
[music playing]

12:55.708 --> 12:59.043
- [laughs] oh,
this is so much fun.

12:59.045 --> 13:02.847
I haven't been to the fair
since I was a little girl.

13:02.849 --> 13:06.984
Oh, look! Cotton candy!
[laughs]

13:07.319 --> 13:08.619
Do you like cotton candy?

13:08.621 --> 13:12.056
- Are you kidding?
I could eat c-cotton
candy all day--

13:12.058 --> 13:14.959
[stammering] uh, uh,
I mean...

13:14.961 --> 13:18.596
Oh, I can either
take it or leave it.

13:18.598 --> 13:23.400
- Hey! They have
a roller coaster!

13:24.336 --> 13:26.270
- Should we go on?

13:26.272 --> 13:27.571
- Are you crazy?!

13:27.573 --> 13:31.041
I mean, I don't know.
Whatever.

13:31.043 --> 13:32.910
- Is everything all right?

13:32.912 --> 13:34.712
You seem strange.

13:34.714 --> 13:37.448
- I'm cool.

13:37.450 --> 13:40.851
[babbling]

13:41.086 --> 13:43.721
- Say, uh, speedy,
give me all your churros.

13:43.723 --> 13:44.722
- Are you crazy?

13:44.724 --> 13:45.890
- I gotta stretch my stomach.

13:45.892 --> 13:48.726
But the idea of eating
another hot dog makes me sick.

13:48.728 --> 13:50.694
And in two hours
I gotta eat 62 of them.

13:50.696 --> 13:53.030
- There's no way
you're gonna win, man.

13:53.032 --> 13:56.400
Have you seen
last year's winner?

13:57.802 --> 14:01.005
- Whew. He looks like
he could eat 62 of you.

14:01.007 --> 14:01.872
- [shudders]

14:01.874 --> 14:04.875
Hey, look!
There's a fortuneteller!

14:04.877 --> 14:06.043
[soothing music playing]

14:06.045 --> 14:10.781
- Continue to breathe
deep, relaxing breaths.

14:10.783 --> 14:13.450
[telephone rings]

14:13.452 --> 14:16.153
- What angle's the ramp
supposed to be at?

14:16.155 --> 14:16.887
- What?

14:16.889 --> 14:18.522
- What angle should
the ramp be at?

14:18.524 --> 14:20.357
And how fast
am I supposed to go?

14:20.359 --> 14:23.260
And what part of the ramp
am I supposed to land on?

14:23.262 --> 14:24.562
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.997
Sam, slow down.
What--what's wrong?

14:26.999 --> 14:28.933
- I'm panicking!
I'm spiraling!

14:28.935 --> 14:31.135
I got so used to
that teeny model,

14:31.137 --> 14:32.903
Now it all looks
so big and scary!

14:32.905 --> 14:34.705
[panting] you gotta
come help me.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.575
I need you here.
My heart's a-racin'!

14:37.577 --> 14:39.643
- That's exactly why
I can't come.

14:39.645 --> 14:41.378
You shouldn't be there either.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.280
- Bugs, please, I'm beggin' you!

14:43.282 --> 14:45.449
I need the emotional support!

14:45.451 --> 14:47.451
You're my best friend!

14:47.453 --> 14:48.586
- What?
- Nothin'.

14:48.588 --> 14:52.489
I didn't say nothin'.
Just come done here.

14:52.491 --> 14:54.224
- Fine.

14:54.226 --> 14:55.960
Dr. Weisberg's gonna kill me,

14:55.962 --> 14:59.663
If my heart doesn't first.

14:59.665 --> 15:00.397
[ring]

15:00.399 --> 15:02.232
Hi. Please leave a message.
[beep]

15:02.234 --> 15:04.535
- Bugs, it's dr. Weisberg.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.337
Look, look, look,
I'm on the internet

15:06.339 --> 15:10.240
And I think I might
have misdiagnosed
your condition.

15:10.242 --> 15:14.478
Turns out your heart
is beating fast because...

15:14.480 --> 15:15.713
You're a rabbit!

15:15.715 --> 15:17.348
That's where they get
the expression,

15:17.350 --> 15:19.583
"my heart's beating
like a rabbit," huh?

15:19.585 --> 15:21.919
Anyway, there's nothing
wrong with your heart.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.288
You're fine.
You're in perfect health.

15:24.290 --> 15:27.725
So go have some fun.
Enjoy your life.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.760
Live a little!

15:29.762 --> 15:31.929
Ok, enough work
for a Saturday.

15:31.931 --> 15:35.132
I'm going to the fair.

15:37.836 --> 15:40.838
- [accent] in my crystal ball
I can see the past,

15:40.840 --> 15:43.607
The present,
and the future.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.809
- Lola, you're not
a fortuneteller.

15:45.811 --> 15:49.413
- Uh, my name is
madame zoldor. So...

15:49.415 --> 15:51.315
- What do you see,
madame zoldor?

15:51.317 --> 15:54.084
Will I win the hot dog
eating contest?

15:54.086 --> 15:56.086
- Let me see.

15:56.088 --> 15:59.423
It's murky.

15:59.425 --> 16:02.092
Aha! I see hot dogs!

16:02.094 --> 16:04.128
So many hot dogs.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.997
- Really? At a hot dog
eating contest?

16:06.999 --> 16:08.532
- [gasp] I see you!

16:08.534 --> 16:09.266
- [gasp]

16:09.268 --> 16:10.768
- You're eating hot dogs.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.870
So many hot dogs.

16:12.872 --> 16:15.005
- More than 5?
Do I win?

16:15.007 --> 16:17.207
- Yes, you win!
You are the winner!

16:17.209 --> 16:21.945
- I knew it!
Thank you, madame zoldor!

16:21.947 --> 16:24.515
- Does the lady want
her palm read?

16:24.517 --> 16:26.483
[drops accent]
or maybe a manicure?

16:26.485 --> 16:30.054
I'm actually a little
better at those.

16:30.188 --> 16:34.591
- Ohh. I think ferris wheels
are kind of romantic.

16:34.593 --> 16:35.859
Don't you?

16:35.861 --> 16:36.560
- [sighs]

16:36.562 --> 16:40.197
[stammering]
they're all right.

16:40.331 --> 16:44.601
- Porky, you just seem
so different from when we met.

16:44.603 --> 16:48.238
- Well, I don't know
what to tell you, petunia.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.240
This is me.
This is who I am.

16:50.242 --> 16:54.978
I'm relaxed
and I'm cool
and I'm chill.

16:54.980 --> 16:57.047
[clanking]

16:57.049 --> 17:00.551
Aah! Wh-what's happening?!

17:00.819 --> 17:02.786
- We must be stuck.

17:02.788 --> 17:03.687
- W-w-we what?!

17:03.689 --> 17:05.823
We're hundreds of feet
off the ground!

17:05.825 --> 17:07.223
Help! Somebody help us!

17:07.226 --> 17:12.128
Aah! Aah! I always knew
I'd d-d-die this way!

17:12.131 --> 17:15.499
[teeth chattering,
knees knocking]

17:19.304 --> 17:21.472
- I think madame zoldor
might be crazy.

17:21.473 --> 17:26.510
There's no way my stomach's
big enough to eat all these.

17:34.986 --> 17:38.255
- Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the 35th annual

17:38.257 --> 17:40.824
Mr. Wiener hot dog
eating contest.

17:40.826 --> 17:42.860
[cheering and applause]

17:42.862 --> 17:46.263
- Uh...That
satin jacket is mine.

17:46.265 --> 17:48.098
- On your mark...

17:48.100 --> 17:50.501
Get set...

17:50.503 --> 17:51.168
Go!

17:51.170 --> 17:54.304
[music playing]

17:54.773 --> 17:57.941
- Hey, why isn't it fixed?
What's taking so long?

17:57.943 --> 18:00.544
When are they
gonna fix it?!

18:00.546 --> 18:02.146
- Porky, calm down.

18:02.148 --> 18:03.180
It's gonna be ok.

18:03.182 --> 18:05.582
- Mm. Uh, petunia, um,

18:05.584 --> 18:08.285
There's something
I have to tell you.

18:08.287 --> 18:10.654
Ever since I picked you up
at the airport,

18:10.656 --> 18:13.690
I've been trying
to play it cool.

18:13.692 --> 18:14.358
- Why?

18:14.360 --> 18:15.993
- Because I was afraid
if you saw

18:15.995 --> 18:17.594
How excited
I was to see you,

18:17.596 --> 18:19.530
You'd think I was d-desperate.

18:19.532 --> 18:23.300
But the truth is,
I am excited to see you.

18:23.302 --> 18:26.570
Also, you should know
that I love cotton candy,

18:26.572 --> 18:32.176
And--and I think you're
the greatest girl
I've ever met.

18:32.178 --> 18:35.045
I g-guess I blew it, huh?

18:37.715 --> 18:39.616
- Good luck.
If you need me,

18:39.618 --> 18:42.252
I'll be over there,
not watching.

18:42.254 --> 18:43.720
- Ladies and gentlemen,

18:43.722 --> 18:45.756
Direct your attention
to the infield

18:45.758 --> 18:48.959
Where local daredevil
yosemite sam

18:48.961 --> 18:51.829
Will attempt to jump
a school bus

18:51.831 --> 18:54.298
Over 15 motorcycles.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.934
[engine revving]

18:56.936 --> 19:00.671
- [grunting]

19:00.673 --> 19:03.640
I can't reach the pedals!

19:03.975 --> 19:05.876
You gotta do the stunt with me.

19:05.878 --> 19:07.811
You gotta be my feet.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.012
- [exhales]

19:09.014 --> 19:11.582
Are you crazy?

19:11.584 --> 19:13.250
- No. I'm a sam.

19:13.252 --> 19:14.985
And if I don't do this,

19:14.987 --> 19:16.186
I'll be the first sam

19:16.188 --> 19:19.556
Who ain't never
accomplished nothin'.

19:19.558 --> 19:21.491
[sobbing]

19:21.493 --> 19:23.193
[bang]

19:23.195 --> 19:24.328
- Move over.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.295
- Oh, thank you!

19:25.297 --> 19:27.664
I knew you was
my best friend!

19:27.666 --> 19:29.299
I mean neighbor.

19:29.301 --> 19:31.268

19:36.308 --> 19:37.341

19:39.078 --> 19:40.477
Daffy duck!

19:40.479 --> 19:42.079
- [gasp]

19:42.081 --> 19:45.282
- [cheering]

19:45.284 --> 19:49.820
- Yeah! Ha ha! Whoo!

19:52.257 --> 19:57.561
- I told him not to enter
that hot dog eating contest.

19:57.563 --> 19:58.862
I told him.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.364
- [cheering]

20:00.366 --> 20:02.933
- Well, this is it.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.168
[classical music playing]

20:05.170 --> 20:06.336
- It'll help me relax.

20:06.338 --> 20:08.238
Don't fall asleep
at the wheel.

20:08.240 --> 20:12.609
- You're listening
to classical 103.1.

20:12.611 --> 20:15.012
[classical music continues]

20:15.014 --> 20:16.980
- [cheering]

20:43.908 --> 20:46.209
[brakes squeal]

20:48.646 --> 20:50.948
- [cheering]

20:50.950 --> 20:53.350
- [grunting]

20:53.352 --> 20:55.852
I'm alive!
I can't believe it!

20:55.854 --> 21:01.959
- Uhh! I can't believe
they don't have seatbelts
on school buses.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.327
[crash] ohh!

21:03.329 --> 21:05.796
- Oh, it's so romantic
up here.

21:05.798 --> 21:11.802
I hope they don't ever
fix this ferris wheel.

21:14.439 --> 21:16.640
[stammering] d-d-daffy?

21:16.642 --> 21:19.309
- That's mr. Wiener!

21:19.311 --> 21:21.979
[music playing]

21:21.981 --> 21:24.147
[pop]

21:28.086 --> 21:30.620
- So go have some fun.
Enjoy your life.

21:30.622 --> 21:31.688
Live a little!
[beep]

21:31.690 --> 21:36.626
- I think a death-defying
stunt qualifies.

21:37.762 --> 21:38.795
- Unbelievable!

21:38.797 --> 21:41.231
They're stripping me
of my title

21:41.233 --> 21:42.632
Because they said I cheated.

21:42.634 --> 21:45.469
I'm not allowed to call
myself mr. Wiener!

21:45.471 --> 21:47.637
- I'll call you mr. Wiener.

21:47.639 --> 21:48.505
- Thanks.

21:48.507 --> 21:50.574
That's why you're
my best friend.

21:50.576 --> 21:53.977
- Don't tell yosemite that.

Now I can drink out of my hat.
