00:04.296 --> 00:07.048
SINCE MOVING TO NEW YORK,

00:04.296 --> 00:07.048
I'VE LOST MY JOB,

00:07.090 --> 00:09.343
MY APARTMENT,AND MY FIANCE.

00:07.090 --> 00:09.343
(moaning)

00:09.384 --> 00:11.470
NOW I'M LIVING

00:09.384 --> 00:11.470
WITH THIS GIRL CHLOE

00:11.512 --> 00:13.681
WHO MAY OR MAY NOT BE

00:11.512 --> 00:13.681
A PSYCHOPATH.

00:13.722 --> 00:15.056
(gargling)

00:15.098 --> 00:17.643
THIS MORNING RITUAL

00:15.098 --> 00:17.643
IS APPARENTLY CALLED

00:17.685 --> 00:19.436
A "HOOKER'S TOOTHBRUSH."

00:19.478 --> 00:21.856
(gulps) AHH.

00:19.478 --> 00:21.856

00:21.897 --> 00:25.066
CHLOE IS BEST FRIENDS WITH

00:21.897 --> 00:25.066
THE ACTOR JAMES VAN DER BEEK.

00:25.108 --> 00:28.069
THERE'S THIS WEIRD NEIGHBOR

00:25.108 --> 00:28.069

00:29.613 --> 00:31.072
AND ELI,

00:29.613 --> 00:31.072

00:31.114 --> 00:32.783
MMM.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.783
(creak)

00:32.825 --> 00:35.076
I BELIEVE THERE ARE TWO WAYS

00:32.825 --> 00:35.076
TO LOOK AT ANY SITUATION.

00:35.118 --> 00:37.538
YOU CAN FOCUS ON THE BAD...

00:37.579 --> 00:39.080
OR CHOOSE TO SEE THE GOOD.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.875
I CHOOSE TO SEE THE GOOD.

00:40.916 --> 00:43.084
I'D BEEN

00:40.916 --> 00:43.084
WITH MY CHEATING FIANCE STEVEN

00:43.126 --> 00:44.169
SINCE I WAS 14.

00:44.211 --> 00:46.254
THAT'S 11 YEARS.

00:46.296 --> 00:49.090
THAT IS

00:46.296 --> 00:49.090
600 NICOLAS CAGE MOVIES.

00:49.132 --> 00:50.300
BUT I'M ACTUALLY OKAY.

00:50.342 --> 00:53.094
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT

00:50.342 --> 00:53.094

JUNE, YOU CAN'T PLAN

01:55.198 --> 01:57.158
YOUR LIFE.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.244

02:02.915 --> 02:05.042
OKAY, HERE IT IS.

02:02.915 --> 02:05.042
I'M GONNA GET MARRIED AT 26,

02:05.084 --> 02:06.334
HAVE MY FIRST BABY AT 28--

02:06.376 --> 02:08.754
A GIRL, MARY,

02:06.376 --> 02:08.754
NAMED AFTER MY NANA--

02:08.796 --> 02:11.090
AND THEN A BOY,

02:08.796 --> 02:11.090

02:11.131 --> 02:12.758
NAMED AFTER CHRISTOPHER ROBIN

02:11.131 --> 02:12.758

02:12.800 --> 02:15.343
NO, NAMED AFTER CHRISTOPHER...

02:15.385 --> 02:17.596
ROBIN

02:15.385 --> 02:17.596
FROM "WINNIE-THE-POOH."

02:17.638 --> 02:19.640
YOU KNOW, POOH DIDN'T WEAR PANTS

02:17.638 --> 02:19.640
EITHER.

02:19.681 --> 02:22.017
ELI! THAT'S HILARIOUS.

02:22.059 --> 02:25.604
MY PLAN WAS GOOD.

02:22.059 --> 02:25.604
MY GUY WAS JUST BAD, OKAY?

02:25.646 --> 02:28.189
AND I JUST READ

02:25.646 --> 02:28.189
IN THIS MAGAZINE, ACTUALLY,

02:28.231 --> 02:31.192
THAT MEN WHO ARE INTO BICYCLING

02:28.231 --> 02:31.192
MAKE EXCELLENT PARTNERS

02:31.234 --> 02:33.779
BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY GOOD

02:31.234 --> 02:33.779

02:33.821 --> 02:35.990
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANNA MEET

02:33.821 --> 02:35.990

02:36.031 --> 02:38.826

02:36.031 --> 02:38.826
PERFECT FOR YOU.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.453
YEAH, I-I... I DON'T THINK SO.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.453

HEY, CHLOE SET ME UP

02:41.495 --> 02:42.913

02:42.955 --> 02:46.207

02:42.955 --> 02:46.207
YOU WANNA MEET HER?

02:46.249 --> 02:48.293

02:48.335 --> 02:51.130
AHH. ISN'T SHE AWESOME?

02:51.170 --> 02:53.007
I MEAN, SHE IS A REPUBLICAN,

02:53.048 --> 02:54.508

02:53.048 --> 02:54.508
WE DON'T TALK POLITICS--

02:54.549 --> 02:56.677
LET ME FINISH.

02:56.718 --> 03:00.221
OH, YOU'RE GONNA LOVE SCOTT.

02:56.718 --> 03:00.221
I'VE KNOWN HIM FOREVER,

03:00.263 --> 03:02.223
AND HE'S INTO BIKING

03:00.263 --> 03:02.223
AND ALL THAT NONSENSE, TOO.

03:02.265 --> 03:06.061
HE'S TOTAL HUSBAND MATERIAL.

03:02.265 --> 03:06.061
TRUST ME.

03:06.103 --> 03:08.814
I SCREWED YOUR FIANCE

03:06.103 --> 03:08.814
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY CAKE.

03:08.856 --> 03:09.815
(squish)

03:09.857 --> 03:12.442
YEAH, I-I-I DON'T...

03:12.484 --> 03:16.279
TRUST YOU WITH ANYTHING...

03:12.484 --> 03:16.279
EVER.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.281
SHE DOESN'T TRUST ME.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.281
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

03:18.323 --> 03:20.325
WELL, YOU DID SLEEP

03:18.323 --> 03:20.325
WITH HER FIANCE

03:20.367 --> 03:22.243
ON HER BIRTHDAY CAKE.

03:22.285 --> 03:25.039
WHAT? IT'S LUTHER,

03:22.285 --> 03:25.039
MY TAILOR AND CONFIDANTE,

03:25.080 --> 03:26.456
THE MAN WHO WEIGHS ME

03:25.080 --> 03:26.456
IN THE MORNING.

03:26.498 --> 03:27.916
WHY DO YOU LOOK LIKE

03:27.958 --> 03:29.668
INDIANA JONES

03:27.958 --> 03:29.668
WHEN HE'S A PROFESSOR?

03:29.710 --> 03:32.253
AAH! I DID IT.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.253
YOU DID IT.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.714
I'M GONNA TEACH

03:32.295 --> 03:33.714
AN ACTING CLASS AT N.Y.U.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.466
I FIGURE IF JAMES FRANCO

03:33.755 --> 03:36.466
CAN DO IT, SO CAN I.

03:36.508 --> 03:38.426
I HATE THAT GUY

03:36.508 --> 03:38.426
EVER SINCE HE BEAT ME OUT

03:38.468 --> 03:40.846
FOR THE ROLE

03:38.468 --> 03:40.846
OF HARVEY MILK'S LOVER.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.263
I'VE HAD A LOT OF LOVERS.

03:42.305 --> 03:45.100
NOT EVERYTHING HAS TO BE

03:42.305 --> 03:45.100

03:45.142 --> 03:46.267
ANYWAY, I HATE FRANCO.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.269
I'M GONNA BEAT HIM

03:46.309 --> 03:48.269
AT ACTING TEACHING.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.313
THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING

03:48.311 --> 03:50.313
IS I KNOW JUNE AND SCOTT

03:50.355 --> 03:51.732
WOULD BE PERFECT TOGETHER.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.567
OH, YEAH, SCOTT WOULD BE GREAT.

03:53.608 --> 03:55.276
JUST DON'T LET JUNE KNOW

03:53.608 --> 03:55.276
YOU'RE BEHIND IT.

03:55.318 --> 03:58.446
OOH. LIKE A STEALTH SETUP.

03:58.488 --> 04:01.282
I'LL TRICK THEM INTO FALLING

03:58.488 --> 04:01.282
IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.284
LOOK AT YOU, CARING.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.204
YOU  CARE.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.204
YOU CARE ABOUT EVERYTHING.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.288
WHY DON'T YOU AND LUTHER

04:05.245 --> 04:07.288
GO RUB BOTTOM-BEARDS TOGETHER

04:07.330 --> 04:09.290
AND SEE IF YOU CAN START

04:07.330 --> 04:09.290

04:09.332 --> 04:12.335
JAMES AND I DON'T HAVE

04:09.332 --> 04:12.335
THAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.505

06:11.454 --> 06:13.414
JUST SO WEIRD.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.000
I MEAN, I'M ACTUALLY ONLY

06:13.456 --> 06:15.000
TRYING THIS BIKING THING

06:15.042 --> 06:16.584
BECAUSE I READ SOMEWHERE

06:16.626 --> 06:19.671
THAT IT WAS A GOOD WAY

06:16.626 --> 06:19.671
TO MEET PEOPLE, SO--

06:16.626 --> 06:19.671
YOU READ "SELF" MAGAZINE?

06:19.713 --> 06:23.424
YES! ALWAYS.

06:19.713 --> 06:23.424
WHAT ABOUT THAT EXPOSE

06:19.713 --> 06:23.424
ON CITRUS FRUIT IN RESTAURANTS?

06:23.466 --> 06:25.302
UGH! FILTHY!

06:25.344 --> 06:28.429
NOW I JUST BRING MY OWN LEMONS

06:25.344 --> 06:28.429
WITH ME EVERYWHERE I GO.

06:28.471 --> 06:32.391
♪♪♪

06:33.476 --> 06:35.436
(indistinct conversations)

06:35.478 --> 06:37.898
IT'S BEEN HARD, BUT...

06:37.939 --> 06:39.691
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE UP

06:37.939 --> 06:39.691
ON MY DREAM.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.526
I'M GONNA GET ANOTHER

06:39.733 --> 06:41.526
WALL STREET JOB.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.444
WELL, YOU CAN EITHER

06:41.568 --> 06:43.444
FOCUS ON THE BAD

06:43.486 --> 06:44.821
OR CHOOSE TO SEE THE GOOD.

06:44.863 --> 06:47.448
I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS TWO WAYS

06:44.863 --> 06:47.448
OF LOOKING AT ANY SITUATION.

06:47.490 --> 06:48.449
YOU KNOW?

06:48.491 --> 06:51.452
I SAY THAT ALL THE TIME.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.412
I CAN LISTEN TO YOU TALK

06:51.494 --> 06:53.412
FOREVER.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.460
(moans) I DON'T NORMALLY

06:57.000 --> 06:59.460
MOVE THIS FAST.

06:59.502 --> 07:02.047
IT TOOK 18 MONTHS

06:59.502 --> 07:02.047
FOR MY FIANCE TO SEE MY BOOBS.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.091
I KNOW. SPRING BREAK

07:02.089 --> 07:04.091
IN FORT MYERS.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.467
YOU ARE SUCH

07:04.132 --> 07:06.467
A GOOD LISTENER.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.262
THAT IS SO HOT.

07:08.303 --> 07:11.390
(both moaning)

07:15.518 --> 07:16.477
(moaning continues)

07:16.519 --> 07:19.647
(singsongy) I KNEW YOU TWO

07:16.519 --> 07:19.647
WOULD LIKE EACH OTHER.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.566
YOU CAN THANK ME

07:19.689 --> 07:21.566
TOMORROW.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.568
GOOD NIGHT, JUNE.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.568
GOOD NIGHT, DAD.

07:23.610 --> 07:26.238
GOOD NIGHT, PRINCESS.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.490
NOW LET'S GET YOU

07:27.572 --> 07:29.490
OUT OF THIS BRA.

07:29.532 --> 07:30.491
(door closes)

07:34.829 --> 07:36.539
OH, MY GOD!

07:34.829 --> 07:36.539
THAT WAS YOUR DAD?!

07:36.581 --> 07:39.584
SO?

07:36.581 --> 07:39.584
(whimpers)

07:39.626 --> 07:41.502
I TOUCHED IT

07:39.626 --> 07:41.502
THROUGH BIKE SHORTS.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.504
I CAN'T GET CLEAN!

07:43.546 --> 07:44.965
SEE, THIS IS WHY

07:43.546 --> 07:44.965
I DIDN'T TELL YOU.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.507
YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE AGREED

07:45.006 --> 07:46.507
TO GO OUT WITH SCOTT

07:46.549 --> 07:47.968
IF YOU HAD KNOWN.

07:48.009 --> 07:51.512
NO, OF COURSE I WOULDN'T HAVE!

07:48.009 --> 07:51.512
BECAUSE IT'S WEIRD!

07:51.554 --> 07:54.515
AND STOP CALLING YOUR DAD

07:51.554 --> 07:54.515
"SCOTT"!

07:54.557 --> 07:56.435
LOOK, MY PARENTS HAD

07:54.557 --> 07:56.435
AN UNHAPPY MARRIAGE.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.894
HE AND MY MOM SEPARATED,

07:57.936 --> 08:00.397
SO I THOUGHT YOU GUYS

07:57.936 --> 08:00.397
WOULD BE GREAT TOGETHER.

08:00.439 --> 08:02.523
I NEED A ROUGHER LOOFAH!

08:02.565 --> 08:04.525
HE DESERVES SO MUCH

08:02.565 --> 08:04.525
BETTER THAN MY MOM.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.527
GROWING UP, SHE WAS ADDICTED

08:04.567 --> 08:06.527
TO PAINKILLERS.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.363
SHE NEVER WANTED TO SPEND

08:06.569 --> 08:08.363
ANY TIME WITH ME.

08:08.405 --> 08:11.199
SHE NEVER TOOK ME ICE-SKATING

08:08.405 --> 08:11.199
OR HORSEBACK RIDING.

08:11.241 --> 08:12.533
SHE'S A REAL BITCH.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.535
OH, I'M SORRY.

08:14.577 --> 08:17.538
I'D FEEL BAD FOR YOU IF I HADN'T

08:14.577 --> 08:17.538
JUST  FRENCHED YOUR FATHER!

08:17.580 --> 08:18.623
(curtain rings swoosh)

08:18.665 --> 08:20.208
(computer chimes)

08:20.250 --> 08:22.836
(chime, whoosh)

08:22.877 --> 08:25.546
OOPS. UM, I'M SORRY.

08:22.877 --> 08:25.546
I WAS TRYING TO TURN IT OFF.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.757
YOU MUST BE JUNE'S PARENTS.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.757
I-I SEE THE RESEMBLANCE.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.717
I'M--I'M SCOTT,

08:27.799 --> 08:29.717
CHLOE'S DAD.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.552
(gasps and laughs)

08:29.759 --> 08:31.552
Oh, okay.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.805
See, you are so handsome.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.805
(laughing)

08:33.847 --> 08:36.641
WHAT? IS THAT MY PARENTS?!

08:36.683 --> 08:38.559
MOM, DAD, I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

08:38.601 --> 08:41.062
OKAY, SCOTT, YOU NEED TO GO.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.147
JUNE, I AM SO SORRY.

08:42.189 --> 08:44.191
CHLOE SAID SHE TOLD YOU

08:42.189 --> 08:44.191
I WAS HER DAD.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.566
I MEAN, I ADMIT AT FIRST,

08:45.608 --> 08:46.860
THE AGE DIFFERENCE

08:45.608 --> 08:46.860
WAS A BIT... STRANGE,

08:46.901 --> 08:49.154
BUT SHE SAID WE WERE REALLY

08:46.901 --> 08:49.154
GONNA GET ALONG, AND WE DID.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.656
YEAH, 'CAUSE, JUNE,

08:49.196 --> 08:51.656
INTERNALLY, YOU'RE, LIKE, 50.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.616
THIS ONE IS

08:51.698 --> 08:53.616
SUCH A LITTLE RASCAL.

08:53.658 --> 08:56.577
ONE TIME SHE HAD ME DO

08:53.658 --> 08:56.577
HER WHOLE SCIENCE FAIR PROJECT.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.579
DADDY! (giggles)

08:58.621 --> 09:00.415
I HAVE TO TAKE

08:58.621 --> 09:00.415
ANOTHER SHOWER.

09:00.457 --> 09:01.582
OKAY, SCOTT,

09:01.624 --> 09:03.584
YOU'RE A GREAT GUY

09:01.624 --> 09:03.584
WITH AMAZING LEGS,

09:03.626 --> 09:06.254
BUT I'M SORRY. I'M NOT

09:03.626 --> 09:06.254
DATING MY ROOMMATE'S DAD,

09:06.296 --> 09:08.589
SO SCOOCH, OKAY?

09:08.631 --> 09:09.590
HERE'S THE DOOR.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.592
YOU'RE THE DAD.

09:11.634 --> 09:14.012
HALF OF CHLOE

09:11.634 --> 09:14.012
CAME FROM YOU.

09:14.054 --> 09:18.599
MY COMPLIMENTS

09:14.054 --> 09:18.599
TO THE CHEF.

09:18.641 --> 09:22.603
COMPLIMENT THE CHEF OUTSIDE.

09:18.641 --> 09:22.603
THANK YOU.

09:22.645 --> 09:25.315
(horn blares)

09:25.357 --> 09:26.983
SO WHEN I BEGIN TO INHABIT

09:25.357 --> 09:26.983
A CHARACTER,

09:27.025 --> 09:29.610
I ASK MYSELF, "WHO IS HE?

09:27.025 --> 09:29.610
WHAT DOES HE WANT?

09:29.652 --> 09:31.029
AND WHAT IS HE GONNA DO

09:29.652 --> 09:31.029
IF HE DOESN'T GET IT?"

09:31.071 --> 09:33.490
NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW THIS

09:31.071 --> 09:33.490
WOULD IMPACT OUR APPROACH

09:33.532 --> 09:35.200
TO THE ROLE OF HAMLET.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.826
WAS IT FUN KISSING

09:35.242 --> 09:36.826
KATIE HOLMES?

09:36.868 --> 09:39.287
(students chuckle)

09:36.868 --> 09:39.287
LET'S TRY AND STAY FOCUSED

09:36.868 --> 09:39.287
ON THE TASK AT HAND HERE--

09:39.329 --> 09:41.622
DID ANYONE HAVE

09:39.329 --> 09:41.622
AN EATING DISORDER?

09:39.329 --> 09:41.622
OKAY, WE'RE NOT HERE TO TALK

09:39.329 --> 09:41.622
ABOUT "DAWSON'S CREEK."

09:41.664 --> 09:43.624
WE'RE HERE TO EXPLORE

09:41.664 --> 09:43.624
THE CRAFT OF ACTING--

09:43.666 --> 09:44.625
DO THE MONOLOGUE

09:43.666 --> 09:44.625
FROM THE EPISODE

09:44.667 --> 09:46.627
WHERE YOU REALIZE

09:44.667 --> 09:46.627
YOU LOVE JOEY!

09:46.669 --> 09:47.712
(students chanting)

09:46.669 --> 09:47.712
DO IT! DO IT!

09:47.754 --> 09:50.715
ALL RIGHT. IN "HAMLET,"

09:47.754 --> 09:50.715
WHAT DO WE HAVE?

09:50.757 --> 09:53.927
WE HAVE A PRINCE WITH A PROB--

09:50.757 --> 09:53.927
SERIOUSLY?!

09:50.757 --> 09:53.927
(chanting continues)

09:53.968 --> 09:55.678
DO IT, DO IT, DO IT!

09:53.968 --> 09:55.678
YOU GUYS DON'T WANNA LEARN

09:53.968 --> 09:55.678
ABOUT ACTING?

09:55.720 --> 09:58.639
ALL YOU WANNA HEAR IS, "JOEY,

09:55.720 --> 09:58.639
GOD, I-I MEAN, THIS IS ALL NEW.

09:58.681 --> 10:01.642
"WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THIS.

09:58.681 --> 10:01.642
BUT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

10:01.684 --> 10:03.270
"WE CAN'T GO BACK

10:01.684 --> 10:03.270
TO THE WAY THINGS WERE.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.813
JOEY, DON'T WALK AWAY

10:03.311 --> 10:05.813
FROM THIS."

10:05.855 --> 10:07.566
(woman whimpers)

10:07.607 --> 10:09.650
(applause)

10:07.607 --> 10:09.650
(woman) OHH.

10:09.692 --> 10:10.818
WHAT?

10:10.860 --> 10:12.487
(laughter)

10:12.529 --> 10:14.448
THE CREEK!

10:14.489 --> 10:16.699
(woman)

10:14.489 --> 10:16.699
HAVE MY BABY, DAWSON!

10:16.741 --> 10:18.659
(horn honks)

10:18.701 --> 10:20.495
I DON'T NORMALLY

10:18.701 --> 10:20.495
MOVE THAT FAST,

10:20.537 --> 10:22.663
BUT I REALLY FELT

10:20.537 --> 10:22.663
A CONNECTION WITH SCOTT,

10:22.705 --> 10:24.665
AND HE FIT PERFECTLY

10:22.705 --> 10:24.665
INTO MY LIFE PLAN,

10:24.707 --> 10:26.334
AND I TOUCHED IT THROUGH

10:24.707 --> 10:26.334
BIKE SHORTS, AND I THINK THAT--

10:26.376 --> 10:28.503
YIKES.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.503
(door bells jingle)

10:28.545 --> 10:30.338
I HAVE  NOTHING  TO SAY

10:28.545 --> 10:30.338
TO YOU.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.673
JUNE, GOD, I MEAN,

10:30.380 --> 10:32.673
THIS IS ALL NEW.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.509
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT.

10:34.551 --> 10:35.676
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

10:34.551 --> 10:35.676
WE CAN'T GO BACK

10:35.718 --> 10:37.678
TO THE WAY THINGS WERE.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.678
JUNE, DON'T WALK AWAY--

10:37.720 --> 10:39.598
THAT'S THE SPEECH

10:37.720 --> 10:39.598
FROM SEASON 1, EPISODE 12

10:39.639 --> 10:41.724
OF "DAWSON'S CREEK,"

10:39.639 --> 10:41.724
I'VE SEEN THEM ALL.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.684
(pounds counter)

10:41.766 --> 10:43.684
DAMN IT! SMALL TOWN GIRL.

10:43.726 --> 10:46.687
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

10:43.726 --> 10:46.687
LOOK, IF YOU DON'T

10:43.726 --> 10:46.687
WANNA DATE MY DAD

10:46.729 --> 10:49.732
BECAUSE HE'S MY DAD, FINE.

10:46.729 --> 10:49.732
IT'S YOUR LOSS.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.359
BUT HE'S REALLY UPSET.

10:51.401 --> 10:54.695
SO CAN YOU AT LEAST

10:51.401 --> 10:54.695
TALK TO HIM?

10:54.737 --> 10:56.948
DAD? STOP DUCKING

10:54.737 --> 10:56.948
BEHIND A CHUBBO.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.909
SORRY. SORRY.

10:59.951 --> 11:01.035
RUNS IN THE FAMILY.

11:02.745 --> 11:03.704
HEY.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.165
HEY.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.709
SEEMS LIKE

11:06.791 --> 11:08.709
A REAL MESSED UP SITUATION.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.712
YEAH, NO ONE'S TO BLAME,

11:08.751 --> 11:11.712
THOUGH, SO THAT'S GOOD.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.714
SO WHAT'S YOUR STORY?

11:11.754 --> 11:13.714
WHO ARE YOU?

11:13.756 --> 11:17.760
WELL, I'M MARK.

11:13.756 --> 11:17.760
I WORK HERE WITH JUNE?

11:17.802 --> 11:19.720
WE'VE MET SEVERAL TIMES

11:17.802 --> 11:19.720
BEFORE. I DON'T--

11:17.802 --> 11:19.720
(door bells jingle)

11:19.762 --> 11:21.764
STUPID N.Y.U. KIDS.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.600
I'M MORE THAN JUST

11:21.806 --> 11:23.600
ONE ROLE.

11:23.642 --> 11:25.101
I WAS THE ORIGINAL GAVROCHE

11:23.642 --> 11:25.101
IN "LES MIS."

11:25.143 --> 11:26.727
I WAS IN KE$HA'S "BLOW" VIDEO.

11:26.769 --> 11:29.523
I WAS IN AN ALL-WHITE PRODUCTION

11:26.769 --> 11:29.523
OF "RAISIN IN THE SUN."

11:29.564 --> 11:30.731
THAT WAS A LONG NIGHT.

11:30.773 --> 11:31.732
I'M TIRED OF PEOPLE

11:30.773 --> 11:31.732
TRYING TO PIGEONHOLE ME.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.734
YOU KNOW, THEY WANNA

11:31.774 --> 11:33.734
PUT ME IN A BOX.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.736
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN, MAN.

11:35.778 --> 11:36.821
I GOT AN MBA FROM STANFORD

11:36.863 --> 11:38.739
AND TWO YEARS

11:36.863 --> 11:38.739
AT A TOP MORTGAGE FIRM,

11:38.781 --> 11:40.741
BUT PEOPLE JUST SEE ME

11:38.781 --> 11:40.741
AS A DUDE WHO MAKES COFFEE.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.827
DO I GET DISCOURAGED?

11:40.783 --> 11:42.827
YEAH, SOMETIMES.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.622
BUT YOU GUYS KNOW ME.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.622
NEVER GONNA GIVE UP.

11:47.248 --> 11:49.668
WHO IS THIS GUY?

11:47.248 --> 11:49.668
WHAT'S HIS STORY?

11:47.248 --> 11:49.668
NO IDEA.

11:49.708 --> 11:52.546
(mutters)

11:49.708 --> 11:52.546
UH... ALL RIGHT.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.130
CHLOE SAID YOU WEREN'T

11:52.587 --> 11:54.130
INTERESTED IN PURSUING THIS,

11:54.172 --> 11:57.258
AND I RESPECT THAT,

11:54.172 --> 11:57.258
BUT GETTING TO KNOW YOU WAS--

11:57.300 --> 11:59.052
AMAZING. I KNOW.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.052
IT'S JUST SO--

11:59.093 --> 12:01.388
COMPLICATED. I GET IT.

12:01.429 --> 12:04.349
I-I JUST--I WANTED YOU

12:01.429 --> 12:04.349
TO HAVE THIS.

12:04.391 --> 12:07.768
IS THAT...

12:04.391 --> 12:07.768
McGRUFF THE CRIME DOG?

12:07.810 --> 12:09.688
I REMEMBER YOU SAID HOW MUCH

12:07.810 --> 12:09.688
YOU LOVED HIM.

12:09.728 --> 12:11.481
YOUR PARENTS WERE

12:09.728 --> 12:11.481
ARGUING A LOT THAT FALL,

12:11.523 --> 12:13.274
AND HE MADE YOU FEEL SAFE.

12:13.316 --> 12:16.027
OH, HEY, A STUFFED ANIMAL

12:13.316 --> 12:16.027
FROM A MUCH OLDER MAN.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.613
NOTHING WEIRD ABOUT THAT.

12:18.655 --> 12:19.864
TOOK ME ALL DAY TO FIND ONE.

12:18.655 --> 12:19.864
WASN'T EASY,

12:19.906 --> 12:22.783
BUT ONCE I SET MY MIND

12:19.906 --> 12:22.783
ON SOMETHING...

12:22.825 --> 12:23.993
I DON'T GIVE UP.

12:25.828 --> 12:32.793
I'M IN A SCOTT-McGRUFF SANDWICH,

12:25.828 --> 12:32.793
AND I'VE NEVER FELT SAFER.

12:32.835 --> 12:35.213
(chuckles)

12:35.255 --> 12:39.300
IN 11 YEARS, STEVEN NEVER

12:35.255 --> 12:39.300
GOT ME A PRESENT LIKE THIS.

12:39.342 --> 12:42.803
HE WAS ALWAYS TOO BUSY

12:39.342 --> 12:42.803
FOCUSING ON HIS WORK

12:42.845 --> 12:44.805
OR HIS CHEATING.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.807
BUT MAYBE THAT RELATIONSHIP

12:44.847 --> 12:46.807
WASN'T MEANT TO BE.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.977
MAYBE I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO

12:46.849 --> 12:49.977
THROUGH ALL OF THAT WITH STEVEN

12:50.019 --> 12:51.812
JUST SO THAT I COULD

12:50.019 --> 12:51.812
MEET YOU.

12:51.854 --> 12:55.816
THIS MIGHT SOUND CHEESY, BUT I

12:51.854 --> 12:55.816
THINK YOU MIGHT BE MY SOUL MATE.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.736
I LIKE CHEESY.

12:58.861 --> 13:02.031
(high-pitched voice)

12:58.861 --> 13:02.031
I LIKE CHEESY, TOO!

13:02.073 --> 13:04.325
THAT'S A VERY GOOD McGRUFF

13:02.073 --> 13:04.325
IMPERSONATION.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.827
(laughs)

13:07.954 --> 13:10.831
♪ BA-DA-DA-DA-DA-BA, BA-DA-BA ♪

13:10.873 --> 13:12.833
CHLOE.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.335
OH, YOU WERE SO RIGHT.

13:14.377 --> 13:16.337
IT DOESN'T MATTER

13:14.377 --> 13:16.337
THE AGE DIFFERENCE

13:16.379 --> 13:17.838
OR HOW WE MET.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.466
ALL THAT MATTERS

13:17.880 --> 13:19.466
IS THAT HE'S A GREAT GUY,

13:19.507 --> 13:22.302
AND WE HAVE

13:19.507 --> 13:22.302
A REALLY NICE CONNECTION.

13:22.343 --> 13:25.430
(sighs) I'M SO SORRY

13:22.343 --> 13:25.430
THAT I DIDN'T TRUST YOU.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.057
THANK YOU.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.057
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

13:29.517 --> 13:30.851
JUNE, THIS IS MY MOM.

13:30.893 --> 13:34.314
SHE'S REALLY UPSET. SHE THINKS

13:30.893 --> 13:34.314
MY DAD IS CHEATING ON HER.

13:37.191 --> 13:38.526
(sighs)

13:38.568 --> 13:41.529
IT'S SO GOOD TO MEET YOU,

13:38.568 --> 13:41.529
HONEY.

13:41.571 --> 13:45.366
NOW BEND DOWN

13:41.571 --> 13:45.366
AND GIVE ME A HUG.

13:45.408 --> 13:46.409
(door closes)

13:52.540 --> 13:53.583
(clenched teeth)

13:52.540 --> 13:53.583
I THOUGHT YOU TOLD ME

13:53.625 --> 13:55.876
THAT YOUR PARENTS

13:53.625 --> 13:55.876
WERE SEPARATED.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.462
THAT'S A LOOSE TERM.

13:57.504 --> 14:00.256
FIVE DAYS AGO,

13:57.504 --> 14:00.256
WE AGREED TO TAKE SOME SPACE.

14:00.298 --> 14:02.467
I WENT TO VISIT GRANDMA

14:00.298 --> 14:02.467
IN SCOTTSDALE...

14:02.509 --> 14:05.345
(voice breaking) AND HE

14:02.509 --> 14:05.345
STARTED PORKING SOME WHORE.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.887
WELL, I DON'T KNOW THAT WE NEED

14:05.386 --> 14:06.887
TO CALL HER NAMES.

14:06.929 --> 14:09.349
MOM, YOU AND DAD

14:06.929 --> 14:09.349
FOUGHT ALL THE TIME.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.726
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WANTED

14:09.390 --> 14:11.726
TO SEPARATE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

14:11.768 --> 14:12.893
YES, BUT A FEW DAYS APART

14:11.768 --> 14:12.893
MADE ME REALIZE

14:12.935 --> 14:14.312
I WANTED TO BE

14:12.935 --> 14:14.312
WITH  YOUR FATHER

14:14.354 --> 14:15.896
AND APPARENTLY

14:14.354 --> 14:15.896
MADE HIM REALIZE

14:15.938 --> 14:17.816
HE WANTED TO BE

14:15.938 --> 14:17.816
WILT CHAMBERLAIN.

14:17.856 --> 14:19.776
MOM, YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:17.856 --> 14:19.776
HE'S MOVED ON.

14:19.818 --> 14:20.901
GET OVER IT.

14:20.943 --> 14:23.904
CHLOE, CAN I SPEAK WITH YOU?

14:26.324 --> 14:27.534
(crying)

14:27.575 --> 14:28.909
(whispers) WHAT THE HELL?!

14:28.951 --> 14:30.203
DON'T FALL FOR IT.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.203
IT'S AN ACT.

14:30.244 --> 14:31.912
SHE'S A TOTAL DRAMA QUEEN.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.914
I THINK I'VE RUINED EVERYTHING!

14:33.956 --> 14:35.916
SEE? SHE WANTS US

14:33.956 --> 14:35.916
TO SAY "NO."

14:35.958 --> 14:36.917
(lowered voice)

14:35.958 --> 14:36.917
SHE'S SUCH A PIECE OF WORK.

14:36.959 --> 14:39.796
SHE SEEMS PRETTY SINCERE,

14:36.959 --> 14:39.796
AND BY THE WAY,

14:39.838 --> 14:41.589
SHE'S IN A WHEELCHAIR,

14:41.631 --> 14:43.007
WHICH IS WHY SHE WAS

14:41.631 --> 14:43.007
ADDICTED TO PAINKILLERS

14:43.049 --> 14:44.300
AND COULDN'T TAKE YOU

14:43.049 --> 14:44.300
ICE-SKATING

14:44.342 --> 14:45.926
OR HORSEBACK RIDING.

14:45.968 --> 14:48.179
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW IF SHE COULD

14:45.968 --> 14:48.179
OR SHE COULDN'T.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.306
ALL I KNOW

14:48.221 --> 14:50.306
IS THAT SHE DIDN'T.

14:50.348 --> 14:52.933
(chuckles)

14:52.975 --> 14:55.144
ISN'T IT OBVIOUS

14:52.975 --> 14:55.144
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

14:55.186 --> 14:56.437
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:56.479 --> 14:57.772
YOU'RE USING JUNE

14:56.479 --> 14:57.772
TO WORK OUT

14:57.814 --> 14:58.939
YOUR RESENTMENT

14:57.814 --> 14:58.939
TOWARDS YOUR MOTHER

14:58.981 --> 15:00.817
AND YOUR OBSESSION

14:58.981 --> 15:00.817
WITH YOUR FATHER.

15:00.859 --> 15:02.402
YOU PERCEIVED YOUR MOTHER

15:02.443 --> 15:04.111
AS NEGLECTFUL

15:02.443 --> 15:04.111
WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD?

15:04.153 --> 15:05.363
YEAH.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.406
SO WHEN SHE

15:05.405 --> 15:06.406
AND YOUR FATHER FOUGHT,

15:06.447 --> 15:07.782
YOU WOULD ALWAYS

15:06.447 --> 15:07.782
SIDE WITH HIM.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.158
I GUESS SO.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.410
WELL, NOW YOU'RE SUBCONSCIOUSLY

15:09.200 --> 15:10.410
USING JUNE AS A PAWN

15:10.451 --> 15:11.870
TO GET BACK AT YOUR MOTHER

15:11.911 --> 15:14.372
AND TO ALIGN YOURSELF

15:11.911 --> 15:14.372
MORE CLOSELY WITH YOUR DAD.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.332
WOW, I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT

15:14.414 --> 15:16.332
LIKE THAT.

15:16.374 --> 15:18.000
YOU NEVER THINK THINGS

15:16.374 --> 15:18.000
THROUGH, CHLOE.

15:18.042 --> 15:21.962
LIKE, DO YOU REALLY WANT JUNE

15:18.042 --> 15:21.962
TO BE YOUR NEW MOM?

15:22.004 --> 15:23.798
YOU'VE GOTTA BREAK UP

15:22.004 --> 15:23.798
WITH MY DAD.

15:23.840 --> 15:24.965
YA  THINK?

15:25.007 --> 15:26.801
ELI, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

15:26.843 --> 15:29.763
I GUESS I GOT A LOT GOING ON

15:26.843 --> 15:29.763
UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE.

15:29.804 --> 15:31.598
I'M LIKE A RIVER IN WINTER.

15:31.639 --> 15:34.267
YOU HAVE TO COME WITH ME

15:31.639 --> 15:34.267
TO BREAK UP WITH YOUR DAD.

15:31.639 --> 15:34.267
WHY?

15:34.308 --> 15:36.185
BECAUSE  YOU  ARE THE ONE

15:34.308 --> 15:36.185
THAT ORCHESTRATED

15:36.227 --> 15:37.562
THIS ENTIRE THING.

15:37.604 --> 15:38.855
HEY, I DIDN'T TAKE

15:37.604 --> 15:38.855
YOUR PANTY-HAMSTER

15:38.897 --> 15:40.899
AND PUT IT ON MY FATHER.

15:40.940 --> 15:44.569
THAT'S ANOTHER THING MY MOTHER

15:40.940 --> 15:44.569
NEVER GOT ME--A HAMSTER.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.070
FINE. LET'S GO.

15:47.822 --> 15:51.992
(indistinct conversations)

15:52.034 --> 15:52.993
(door closes, door bells jingle)

15:52.034 --> 15:52.993
DUDE, I HAD AN INSIGHT.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.662
JAMES, NOT NOW.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.662
I'M SLAMMED.

15:54.704 --> 15:56.372
WE JUST GOT A HUGE WAVE

15:54.704 --> 15:56.372
OF CUSTOMERS.

15:56.414 --> 15:58.040
YEAH, I KNOW.

15:56.414 --> 15:58.040
THEY CAME TO SEE ME.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.584
I TWEETED

15:58.082 --> 15:59.584
I WAS GONNA PERFORM HERE.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.586
IF PEOPLE ONLY SEE ME ONE WAY,

15:59.626 --> 16:01.586
IT'S UP TO  ME

16:01.628 --> 16:03.170
TO SHOW THEM

16:01.628 --> 16:03.170
I HAVE OTHER SWORDS IN MY BELT.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.714
NO, WE'RE NOT ZONED

16:03.212 --> 16:04.714
FOR THIS.

16:04.756 --> 16:06.507
PEOPLE ARE SITTING

16:04.756 --> 16:06.507
ON THE SWEETENER BAR.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.175
POP-UP THEATER.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.175
YOU CAN'T BE ZONED FOR ART.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.677
HERE. HOLD THOSE.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.677
AND GET ME A WATER...

16:09.719 --> 16:12.513
A PERCENTAGE OF WHICH

16:09.719 --> 16:12.513
WENT TO FEED HUNGRY CHILDREN.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.309
(woman)

16:15.057 --> 16:16.309
OH, THERE HE IS!

16:16.350 --> 16:19.061
LET'S DO SOME SHAKESPEARE.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.647
"DOUBT THOU THE STARS ARE FIRE;

16:20.688 --> 16:22.690
"DOUBT THAT THE SUN DOTH MOVE;

16:22.732 --> 16:26.026
"DOUBT TRUTH TO BE A LIAR;

16:22.732 --> 16:26.026
BUT NEVER...

16:26.068 --> 16:27.946
DOUBT I LOVE."

16:30.114 --> 16:33.534
DID YOU AND PACEY

16:30.114 --> 16:33.534
EVER DO A SCENE DRUNK?

16:33.576 --> 16:35.662
(crowd) YEAH.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.662
(woman) I LOVE YOU, DAWSON!

16:35.703 --> 16:37.204
(under breath) FORGET IT.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.039
(woman) YOU'RE EVERYWHERE

16:37.246 --> 16:39.039
AND NOWHERE, DAWSON!

16:37.246 --> 16:39.039
(clatter)

16:39.081 --> 16:41.417
WHAT IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE?

16:39.081 --> 16:41.417
SOMEONE STOLE

16:39.081 --> 16:41.417
THE HALF AND HALF.

16:41.459 --> 16:43.085
WHY WON'T THEY SEE ME

16:41.459 --> 16:43.085
AS SOMETHING ELSE?

16:43.127 --> 16:44.838
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

16:44.879 --> 16:47.674
ALL THESE PEOPLE DROPPED

16:44.879 --> 16:47.674
EVERYTHING TO COME SEE YOU.

16:47.715 --> 16:50.635
ALL THESE GIRLS AND THAT DUDE

16:47.715 --> 16:50.635
IN THE MESH TANK TOP

16:50.677 --> 16:52.052
WOULD CLEARLY

16:50.677 --> 16:52.052
HAVE SEX WITH YOU.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.680
YOU'RE RICH, FAMOUS,

16:52.094 --> 16:53.680
AND ADORED,

16:53.721 --> 16:55.849
BUT YOU'RE UPSET THAT YOU'RE

16:53.721 --> 16:55.849
ADORED FOR THE WRONG REASONS?

16:55.890 --> 16:58.434
EXACTLY.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.060
I WALK A LONELY ROAD.

17:00.102 --> 17:02.062
I MADE $4 TODAY.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.064
NAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.064
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.984
(woman)

17:04.106 --> 17:05.984
TAKE ME WITH YOU, DAWSON!

17:09.111 --> 17:11.531
HEY, MY TWO GIRLS.

17:11.572 --> 17:12.782
YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:11.572 --> 17:12.782
THAT  IS  WEIRD.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.075
I'M STARTING

17:12.824 --> 17:15.075
TO HEAR IT.

17:15.117 --> 17:18.078
SCOTT, I'M SORRY.

17:15.117 --> 17:18.078
I CAN'T DO THIS.

17:18.120 --> 17:20.581
I-I THOUGHT I COULD OVERLOOK

17:18.120 --> 17:20.581
THE FACT THAT

17:20.623 --> 17:22.082
YOU'RE CHLOE'S DAD.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.082
IT'S QUIRKY. THAT'S NEW YORK-Y.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.501
BUT I CAN'T DO IT.

17:23.543 --> 17:26.253
OKAY? YOUR WIFE IS

17:23.543 --> 17:26.253
IN MY APARTMENT RIGHT NOW

17:26.295 --> 17:29.549
CRYING IN A WHEELCHAIR.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.509
LOOK, I'M SORRY

17:29.590 --> 17:31.509
KAREN'S UPSET,

17:31.551 --> 17:34.345
BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE

17:31.551 --> 17:34.345
THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT YOU.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.890
I MEANT WHAT I SAID

17:34.387 --> 17:36.890
ABOUT US BEING SOULMATES.

17:36.931 --> 17:39.099
SOULMATES?  YOU BARELY

17:36.931 --> 17:39.099
KNOW EACH OTHER.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.561
SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THAT YOUR

17:39.141 --> 17:41.561
FAVORITE MOVIE IS "BOWFINGER."

17:41.602 --> 17:42.812
WHAT IS "BOWFINGER"?

17:41.602 --> 17:42.812
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

17:42.854 --> 17:45.147
IT'S A MOVIE THAT CAME OUT,
