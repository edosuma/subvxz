the first union in the world

purely on a gay rights issue.

A double.

just letting a bunch of rabid
right-wingers in his own government

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:12.080
dictate a position
that he knows is wrong!

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:13.600
If we cannot get
our own community on board...

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.600
MARG: I couldn't give a shit
about his personal sympathies.

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.160
..how can we possibly
win over the straights?

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:19.160
It doesn't change the fact
that according to the government

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.680
I am...I'm a sick criminal
with...with no rights

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:25.440
and I have to ask THEM
to give me my children back.

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:28.400
There have been cases where
lesbians have been given custody...

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:30.000
Yeah, I know! I know!

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.520
With conditions - we...

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:33.440
..we sleep in separate bedrooms.
Yes.

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:35.880
We...we don't talk about
lesbian activism.

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:39.120
We don't...we don't discuss
sexuality with our own kids!

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.640
I know, Marg. I know.

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:41.880
But she would be with us.

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:43.920
Yeah, until they found a way
to say that we had breached,

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:45.480
and they took her away...

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:47.720
Fuck!
What?

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.000
Oh, no, I'm alright.
What?

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.320

Oh!

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:54.120
Ogh!
What?

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:55.480
Oh, God!
Where's the pain?

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:56.840
You're not...
you're not alright, Marg.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.400
Is there tightness?
Mm!

01:06:58.400 --> 01:06:59.600
Call an ambulance!

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.680

OK, Marg, look at me.

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:11.280
Hi.

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:14.240

..we can, um...

01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:59.080

much more of this.

I am. I'm her father. What's going...

I might be able to help you if...
Is that your daddy, is it?

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:56.560
Yeah.
Can you please stop...

she wanted more ice-cream.

Uh, at home.

a good man or a bad man?

Oh, OK, alright. No, no, no -
this is actually harassment.

If you've got an issue
and think that she's being abused,

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:40.720
then you need to arrest me.

didn't it?

a gay solidarity group

..some of the gay and lesbian
groups in Sydney

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:42.880
to come together
and plan a response.

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:46.000

or a forum...

it sounds so dreary.

to this march

01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:55.080
when no-one's gone
to any other march?

Do you...do you, uh, need any help
approaching the other groups?

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.240
Oh, it's already done.

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.520

we'd really welcome your ideas.

Mm-hm.

Did you, um...have a moment?

we're, uh...we're finished here.

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:22.320
I just want you to take me to the
forest and shoot me in the head

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:23.720
and bury me,
'cause I'm that depressed.

it's not gonna be how it was.

and the negative publicity -

It's PUTTING people off.

and isolated

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:41.920
and afraid of...being...

that CAMP should just focus

There were only...six people
at the last protest.

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:38.320
That would be because
it was a protest, Lance,

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:40.120

01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:41.840
