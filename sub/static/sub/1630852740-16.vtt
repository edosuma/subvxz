00:02.263 --> 00:04.439
<i>Tonight a woman</i> <i>
almost lost her life</i>

00:04.482 --> 00:06.310
<i>from a routine tummy tuck.</i>

00:06.354 --> 00:10.140
I have a scar on my stomach
that I can fit my whole hand in.

00:10.184 --> 00:12.316
I touched her.
She was ice cold.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.057
I told her, "I'm gonna take you
to the hospital."

00:17.539 --> 00:20.020
<i>And a fellow doctor</i> <i>
was duped by a colleague</i>

00:20.063 --> 00:22.370
<i>and lost everything.</i>

00:22.413 --> 00:23.371
I thought I was getting
Restylane or Juvederm.

00:23.414 --> 00:24.937
- What was it?
- It was silicone.

00:24.981 --> 00:26.504
- Ooh.
- All of sudden,

00:26.548 --> 00:28.071
it just went boom, and there was
this huge granulomas.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.116
Yeah.

00:29.159 --> 00:30.073
What happened to your practice?

00:30.117 --> 00:31.596
I had to close it.

00:31.640 --> 00:32.815
Oh, my God.

00:32.858 --> 00:35.513
So this is where I can cut
in the nerves.

00:35.557 --> 00:38.168
She can wake up paralyzed in
different parts of her face.

00:38.212 --> 00:41.389
This is going straight
down the bone.

00:41.432 --> 00:42.955
<i>
And a former patient</i>

00:42.999 --> 00:45.088
<i>has made quite a transformation.</i>

00:45.132 --> 00:47.090
I had everything done. Look.

00:47.134 --> 00:49.049
From head to toe.

00:49.092 --> 00:50.876
- Like, everything.
- Everything.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.095
Wow.

00:52.139 --> 00:54.837
I would like my breasts
to look bigger

00:54.880 --> 00:57.100
than what they look right now.

00:58.275 --> 01:00.147

01:26.869 --> 01:29.959
I've met the doctors
few times in the past,

01:30.002 --> 01:34.529
but back then, I looked...
a little bit different.

01:34.572 --> 01:36.400
My name is Rodrigo. I'm 31.

01:36.444 --> 01:38.141
I'm from Brazil,
but I live in London.

01:38.185 --> 01:40.752
I had my entire jawline reconstructed.

01:40.796 --> 01:43.190
Three nose jobs.
Silicone implants in my chest.

01:43.233 --> 01:46.410
I had
the most perfect six-pack.

01:46.454 --> 01:50.849
I was Rodrigo Alves,
but now I'm Jessica Alves.

01:50.893 --> 01:54.766
I'm the woman that I was meant
to be at birth.

01:54.810 --> 01:56.420
Jessica, I wanna see.

01:56.464 --> 02:00.076
- ♪ Ta-da
- There you go!

02:00.120 --> 02:01.599
It fits you perfectly.

02:01.643 --> 02:03.906
I was living a double life.

02:03.949 --> 02:06.387
At daytime, I was Rodrigo Alves.

02:06.430 --> 02:09.041
I had beautiful jackets
and shoes

02:09.085 --> 02:13.350
and I would attend
amazing events across the world.

02:13.394 --> 02:16.701
At night, I was Jessica Alves.

02:16.745 --> 02:18.616
I would go back to home
or my hotel,

02:18.660 --> 02:21.141
take everything off
and put my wig on,

02:21.184 --> 02:26.015
put red lipstick, lingerie,
sit in front of television,

02:26.058 --> 02:27.756
and have a pizza.

02:27.799 --> 02:31.629
I was afraid to come out
as a transgender woman.

02:31.673 --> 02:34.197
So I tried my best to be a man
with plastic surgeries

02:34.241 --> 02:35.851
to make me look more masculine,

02:35.894 --> 02:39.289
but I felt like I was lying
to myself,

02:39.333 --> 02:41.248
lying to my friends,
to my family.

02:41.291 --> 02:43.250
To a point,
that life became unbearable.

02:43.293 --> 02:45.121
So I started my transition.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.646
Throughout the years,
I have had 76 plastic surgeries.

02:48.690 --> 02:52.389
I have spent
about a million dollars.

02:52.433 --> 02:53.782
In one year and a half,

02:53.825 --> 02:56.306
I have had
my face feminization surgeries,

02:56.350 --> 02:57.786
my butt feminization,

02:57.829 --> 02:59.788
breast implants, and my
gender reassignment surgery.

02:59.831 --> 03:01.355
And it's just
a wonderful feeling.

03:01.398 --> 03:05.228
Everything makes sense
to me now being female.

03:05.272 --> 03:08.362
<i>♪ I'm ready for you,</i> <i>
mmm-mmm, baby, mmm-mmm ♪</i>

03:08.405 --> 03:10.190
<i>♪ Can I get some</i> <i>
of your buttercup? ♪</i>

03:10.233 --> 03:12.235
Yes.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.281
Life is a catwalk now.

03:14.324 --> 03:17.545
Everywhere I go,
I get attention. I turn heads.

03:17.588 --> 03:20.548
Cars stop. Cars crash.

03:20.591 --> 03:23.290
I love my body now,
but without a bra,

03:23.333 --> 03:26.554
my breasts are far too low,
far too apart.

03:26.597 --> 03:29.034
I really hope that
Dr. Nassif and Dubrow

03:29.078 --> 03:30.514
will be able to help me.

03:30.558 --> 03:32.255
I wonder what
they're gonna think of me

03:32.299 --> 03:34.083
when they see me now.

03:34.126 --> 03:37.260
Will they actually recognize me?

03:42.134 --> 03:44.876
I wouldn't wish this on anybody.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.618
Maybe Hitler,
but that's about it.

03:47.662 --> 03:50.926
My name is Gina, and I lost half
my cheek and my lower eyelid

03:50.969 --> 03:53.537
from what I thought
was a simple injection.

03:53.581 --> 03:56.540
Instead I got injected
with silicone.

03:56.584 --> 03:58.455
Some nasty was
put in my face,

03:58.499 --> 04:00.370
and I was devastated.
Silicone is just--

04:00.414 --> 04:02.764
It wreaks havoc on your body.

04:02.807 --> 04:06.071
Looked like I had this huge
alien popping out of my face.

04:06.115 --> 04:09.901
As a female, like,
your identity is your face.

04:09.945 --> 04:13.209
My sense of self-worth
was just--just demolished.

04:13.253 --> 04:17.300
You just feel like--like kinda
like your world has ended,

04:17.344 --> 04:19.215
like why did this happen to me?

04:19.259 --> 04:21.478
Like you wish you could get
a, you know, time machine

04:21.522 --> 04:24.829
and go back and you know,
wish you could change

04:24.873 --> 04:28.833
just the--just those minutes
or just one little procedure

04:28.877 --> 04:32.924
just totally derailed
my entire future.

04:39.235 --> 04:40.105
Ah.

04:40.149 --> 04:41.411
What are you doing?

04:41.455 --> 04:42.804
Is that an otoscope thing?

04:42.847 --> 04:44.849
It's for ear wax.
It has a camera.

04:44.893 --> 04:46.503
It's like a freaking forest
in here.

04:46.547 --> 04:49.550
Ew. Disgusting.

04:49.593 --> 04:51.465
Trust me,
do not show Brittany that.

04:51.508 --> 04:53.815
You will never have sex again,
I promise you.

04:53.858 --> 04:55.120
By the way, you wanna hear
something crazy

04:55.164 --> 04:56.383
that I just developed?

04:56.426 --> 04:58.428
- What'd you develop?
- A hemorrhoid.

04:58.472 --> 05:00.778
Terry, I know we're close, brother,

05:00.822 --> 05:03.259
but I don't wanna hear
about your friggin' hemorrhoids.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.393
My ears are clean.
Let's check out my hemorrhoid.

05:06.436 --> 05:07.655
Wait.

05:07.698 --> 05:09.047
- Check it out.
- Oh, my God. Look at that!

05:09.091 --> 05:11.136
That...is the hemorrhoid.
Look at that thing.

05:11.180 --> 05:12.616
Look at that.

05:12.660 --> 05:14.662
As a Board-certified physician,

05:14.705 --> 05:16.620
I wanna tell you very clearly,

05:16.664 --> 05:19.101
never stick anything
inside your ear canal.

05:19.144 --> 05:20.842
It may do serious damage.

05:20.885 --> 05:22.496
- I just got lightheaded.
- Smell it.

05:22.539 --> 05:24.236
- No, get away from me.
- Smell it, smell it.

05:24.280 --> 05:27.805
However, if you wanna stick it
up your ass, go ahead.

05:27.849 --> 05:29.459
You know when you've
actually told me

05:29.503 --> 05:31.592
that a picture
really says it all?

05:31.635 --> 05:34.464
A picture is worth
a thousand words.

05:37.162 --> 05:39.208
Oh, my gosh.

05:39.251 --> 05:42.472
She got injected, and this is
what happened to her.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.344
- This is her today.
- Whoa.

05:44.387 --> 05:46.258
She's got a major, major,
major problem.

05:46.302 --> 05:47.477
Wow.

05:47.521 --> 05:48.826
Can you please send in
Dr. Anderson?

05:48.870 --> 05:52.308
This is a doctor? Holy

05:52.352 --> 05:54.441
- Hello.
- Dr. Anderson.

05:54.484 --> 05:56.660
How are you?
What do you want us to call you?

05:56.704 --> 05:57.661
- Gina.
- Gina.

05:57.705 --> 05:58.488
- Gina.
- And I'm Dave.

05:58.532 --> 05:59.837
My brother.

05:59.881 --> 06:01.796
In Oregon, I've seen
all the specialists,

06:01.839 --> 06:03.711
and they can't help me.

06:03.754 --> 06:07.845
So I need to go to the best
to get help,

06:07.889 --> 06:11.022
and Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow--
they are some of the best

06:11.066 --> 06:12.415
and most knowledgeable people
when it comes

06:12.459 --> 06:14.852
to silicone complications.

06:14.896 --> 06:17.420
- What kind of doctor are you?
- Neurology.

06:17.464 --> 06:18.856
Those were the smart ones
in med school.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.337
You know what they say
about surgeons.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.947
They know nothing
and do everything,

06:22.991 --> 06:25.776
and neurologists know everything
and do nothing.

06:28.257 --> 06:29.737
So, Gina,
looking at these photos,

06:29.780 --> 06:32.609
please take us back because,
you know, you're a doctor.

06:32.653 --> 06:34.132
We're kind of a little lost
how this happened to you.

06:34.176 --> 06:35.699
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

06:35.743 --> 06:39.442
Well, actually, a colleague
offered to do filler for me.

06:39.486 --> 06:41.705
I was like, you know,
I'm in my 40s.

06:41.749 --> 06:43.577
I'm gonna look
a little bit better,

06:43.620 --> 06:44.578
and I thought I was getting
Restylane or Juvederm.

06:44.621 --> 06:46.754
- What was it?
- It was silicone.

06:46.797 --> 06:48.277
Ooh.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.322
And obviously, it's something
that's not FDA-approved

06:50.366 --> 06:51.889
and illegal to inject.

06:51.933 --> 06:53.804
Both cheeks?
Anywhere else on the face?

06:53.848 --> 06:56.241
It was actually both cheek
I was injected,

06:56.285 --> 06:59.419
but it turns out there's no
silicone in my left.

06:59.462 --> 07:00.898
What? But...

07:00.942 --> 07:02.422
So we think it was
two different injections.

07:02.465 --> 07:05.207
Yeah, or two different products.
We're not really sure.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.905
Isn't there a notation
exactly what was injected?

07:07.949 --> 07:10.821
- Mine was lost. Yeah.
- The whole chart?

07:10.865 --> 07:11.866
Yes.

07:11.909 --> 07:12.910
Wow.

07:12.954 --> 07:16.740
So when did you
exhibit symptoms?

07:16.784 --> 07:18.960
- Like around year four.
- Year--

07:19.003 --> 07:20.483
Year four, boom.

07:20.527 --> 07:21.658
All of a sudden,
it just went boom,

07:21.702 --> 07:23.312
and there's just
huge granulomas.

07:23.355 --> 07:25.575
Yeah, in a day or a week
or what--

07:25.619 --> 07:27.708
In almost, like,
in just a couple days.

07:27.751 --> 07:30.101
When you get a granuloma,

07:30.145 --> 07:32.103
which is a foreign body
inflammatory reaction,

07:32.147 --> 07:35.019
that typically happens
within six months to a year.

07:35.063 --> 07:39.067
The fact that Gina didn't start
developing those granulomas

07:39.110 --> 07:41.112
till way later indicates

07:41.156 --> 07:46.335
it's a very slow, smoldering
inflammatory chronic response

07:46.378 --> 07:50.513
that potentially could be
very, very difficult,

07:50.557 --> 07:52.472
but not impossible to treat.

07:52.515 --> 07:54.822
How many separate operations
have you had on this area?

07:54.865 --> 07:57.738
I had five.
The first one wasn't bad,

07:57.781 --> 08:00.262
and just removed the granuloma,
but then it came back.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.873
So four months later, they tried
to get the silicone out,

08:02.917 --> 08:05.528
and that didn't work because,
like, the granulomas came back.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.138
So it just kept coming back
and forth.

08:07.182 --> 08:09.793
And then a month later,
just got so much worse.

08:09.837 --> 08:11.403
The granulomas actually made
a hole in my cheek,

08:11.447 --> 08:12.709
a big hole.
- Yeah.

08:12.753 --> 08:16.670
They actually did a flap
to the lower eyelid area

08:16.713 --> 08:18.106
to reattach the skin

08:18.149 --> 08:20.891
Then a year later,
it was the same procedure--

08:20.935 --> 08:24.155
a local skin flap, and then
less than a month later,

08:24.199 --> 08:27.898
to clean it out again because
my--the granulomas came back.

08:27.942 --> 08:31.554
When was your last surgery?
It was June of last year.

08:31.598 --> 08:32.947
I think there might be
some silicone,

08:32.990 --> 08:34.905
but the granulomas have
really decreased a lot.

08:34.949 --> 08:37.647
In the process of all this,
what happened to your practice?

08:37.691 --> 08:40.737
- I had to close it.
- Oh, my God.

08:40.781 --> 08:43.000
When you can't sleep
and you're in constant pain,

08:43.044 --> 08:46.526
it's hard to, you know,
think on your feet all the time.

08:46.569 --> 08:48.528
- And the eye--
- So you have

08:48.571 --> 08:50.181
chronic facial pains.
- Yes.

08:50.225 --> 08:51.966
Now this isn't, like, just me
looking like slightly pretty.

08:52.009 --> 08:54.534
I mean, this is like
I'm in agony.

08:54.577 --> 08:55.970
I don't sleep.
My hair started thinning,

08:56.013 --> 08:58.450
kind of like a hair loss,
and I just started feeling

08:58.494 --> 09:00.670
kind of, like,
weak and fatigued.

09:00.714 --> 09:02.759
It's been a nightmare.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.892
How many years did you
actually stop the practice?

09:04.935 --> 09:07.198
- Um, two years ago.
- Two years ago.

09:07.242 --> 09:10.680
Just seeing her, all the things
that this has cost her

09:10.724 --> 09:13.770
has been very devastating.

09:13.814 --> 09:16.207
Gina's afraid to even hope
because it's just been

09:16.251 --> 09:21.169
such a long slog through
sort of the valley of despair.

09:21.212 --> 09:22.431
What are your goals now?

09:22.474 --> 09:23.867
What would you really like
to have happen?

09:23.911 --> 09:27.479
To restore my appearance
would be great

09:27.523 --> 09:29.873
and also decrease my pain.

09:29.917 --> 09:32.006
And who would've thought
a simple injection

09:32.049 --> 09:34.269
would lead to years of this?

09:34.312 --> 09:35.792
I know.

09:35.836 --> 09:39.709
Let's say somehow we were able
to do something for you.

09:39.753 --> 09:41.058
Can you think about getting
back into medicine

09:41.102 --> 09:44.235
if we made you better?
- Heck, yeah.

09:44.279 --> 09:46.716
- That would be wonderful.
- That would be so incredible

09:46.760 --> 09:48.239
that if we could do something

09:48.283 --> 09:49.589
to actually get you
practicing again.

09:49.632 --> 09:50.807
Yeah, we gotta figure this out.

09:50.851 --> 09:52.243
- Yeah, definitely.
- You know, so that we can

09:52.287 --> 09:53.767
actually get your life back.
- That would be great.

09:53.810 --> 09:55.464
- Thank you.
- Let's go do it.

09:57.553 --> 09:58.902
This is extremely complicated.

09:58.946 --> 10:01.601
Who knows what can happen,
playing with silicone?

10:01.644 --> 10:04.081
Because
it's like playing with fire.

10:04.125 --> 10:06.606
The surgeon was going like this
to my stomach,

10:06.649 --> 10:08.956
and there was water.
- So she has a seroma, too, now.

10:08.999 --> 10:12.307
He told me that he would take
a syringe, take out the fluid,

10:12.350 --> 10:14.875
and he took almost a gallon.

10:16.224 --> 10:18.182
<i>♪ I wanna be perfect</i>

10:20.228 --> 10:23.405
Here's the main focus
right here, right?

10:23.448 --> 10:27.235
This tissue right here
and that scar right here,

10:27.278 --> 10:28.584
we're looking at the bad tissue,

10:28.628 --> 10:30.064
tissue that needs to be removed
and thrown away.

10:30.107 --> 10:31.543
Mm-hmm.

10:31.587 --> 10:34.285
You have a complex puzzle.

10:34.329 --> 10:37.767
So thinking about this,
starting with the eye,

10:37.811 --> 10:40.552
we have to add some volume
to that lower eyelid, okay?

10:40.596 --> 10:43.207
I have a buddy I've known
from college.

10:43.251 --> 10:47.603
His name is Dr. Guy Massry.
He's an oculoplastic surgeon.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.953
So I need that specialist
to help me do that.

10:49.997 --> 10:52.129
That area
of that triangle there,

10:52.173 --> 10:53.609
you're having
chronic pain there,

10:53.653 --> 10:55.306
we need to somehow free up
that nerve.

10:55.350 --> 10:56.917
- You have a little belly fat.
- Yep.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.701
So maybe we take a little bit
of that belly fat

10:58.745 --> 11:01.008
and we have to add some volume
underneath here.

11:01.051 --> 11:02.923
Now I can tell you now
this is not gonna be easy.

11:02.966 --> 11:05.360
This is extremely complicated.

11:05.403 --> 11:07.754
Who knows what can happen,
playing with silicone?

11:07.797 --> 11:09.625
Because it's like playing
with fire.

11:09.669 --> 11:10.931
There's a lot
of high stakes here

11:10.974 --> 11:12.759
because I'm not gonna know
if all the silicone

11:12.802 --> 11:17.851
is gone...possibly in surgery,
but most likely after surgery,

11:17.894 --> 11:20.375
because we have
to see how her face reacts.

11:20.418 --> 11:22.769
She can get granulomas.

11:22.812 --> 11:24.945
She can get collections of fluid
called seromas.

11:24.988 --> 11:28.252
Any of these things can happen
after surgery,

11:28.296 --> 11:29.993
so it's a big mystery.

11:30.037 --> 11:32.648
Would you be happy with
a 30, 40, 50% improvement?

11:32.692 --> 11:36.826
Yes. I'd just like
anything to get better.

11:36.870 --> 11:39.176
As a doctor,
I'm actually pretty nervous.

11:39.220 --> 11:40.787
My case would be considered
a zebra,

11:40.830 --> 11:44.355
which means that it's something
very exotic,

11:44.399 --> 11:47.663
a case that you pretty much
never see.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.273
But I feel like
I'm in good hands.

11:50.361 --> 11:51.623
- So...
- Yes.

11:51.667 --> 11:53.234
We need to put our heads together,

11:53.277 --> 11:55.627
knowing that it's gonna be
an extremely difficult surgery.

11:55.671 --> 11:57.542
You need extraordinary measures

11:57.586 --> 12:01.459
for an extraordinarily
complex problem.

12:04.375 --> 12:06.682
- Did you work out today?
- I did.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.510
You know, I tried to jog
for a little while.

12:08.553 --> 12:10.817
I started feeling pain,
so I stopped.

12:10.860 --> 12:13.080
My name is Bianca,
and I have a scar on my stomach

12:13.123 --> 12:16.300
that I can fit my whole hand in.

12:16.344 --> 12:18.912
every day, I have to put
some kind of lotion.

12:18.955 --> 12:21.175
It itches a lot.
It feels like it's ripping.

12:21.218 --> 12:23.481
It is very, very painful.

12:23.525 --> 12:26.310
After I gave birth
to my daughter,

12:26.354 --> 12:28.269
I felt horrible about my body.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.401
I wasn't confident
with myself anymore.

12:30.445 --> 12:32.360
Jose started taking me
to the gym,

12:32.403 --> 12:34.014
and I started losing weight.

12:34.057 --> 12:38.888
But that wasn't enough, because
the skin was still hanging

12:38.932 --> 12:40.368
off my jeans.

12:40.411 --> 12:41.978
I felt like I had to do
something about it.

12:42.022 --> 12:46.287
So I'm thinking I need
a tummy tuck to feel sexy,

12:46.330 --> 12:49.333
and now my stomach is deformed.

12:49.377 --> 12:50.813
I miss a lot of things
we used to do.

12:50.857 --> 12:53.337
You're not the happy Bianca
I know.

12:53.381 --> 12:54.817
You don't look at yourself
in the mirror

12:54.861 --> 12:56.079
like you usually do.

12:56.123 --> 12:57.820
You don't model for me
like you always do.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.822
I can't.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.955
I don't even like touching it, honestly.

13:01.998 --> 13:05.828
Since it's a thin layer of skin,
I feel the inside of my stomach.

13:05.872 --> 13:08.788
I don't know if that's normal,
but when I eat too much,

13:08.831 --> 13:12.835
I feel like I have to throw up
because it's so tight.

13:12.879 --> 13:15.490
This time,
it's gonna be perfect.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.274
Thank you, honey. Thank you.

13:17.318 --> 13:19.233
- Okay?
- Just yes.

13:26.153 --> 13:28.459
Bianca, please have a seat.

13:28.503 --> 13:30.592
Okay. We have a lot
to talk about.

13:30.635 --> 13:32.246
- Yes, we do.
- So let's go back.

13:32.289 --> 13:35.466
- Why did you need a tummy tuck?
- What was going on with you?

13:35.510 --> 13:38.165
Um, after you get pregnant
and have a baby,

13:38.208 --> 13:41.298
you do have that extra skin,
so I had my surgery,

13:41.342 --> 13:43.561
but they didn't tell me I wasn't
gonna come out with my grenades.

13:43.605 --> 13:45.433
Grenades. Yes.

13:45.476 --> 13:47.000
- The drains.
- We call 'em grenades 'cause

13:47.043 --> 13:48.044
that's what they look like.
- They look like, no.

13:48.088 --> 13:49.654
But why did you expect them?

13:49.698 --> 13:52.875
Because all the surgeries
I-I seen comes out with drains.

13:52.919 --> 13:55.486
By the way, there is something
called a drainless tummy tuck.

13:55.530 --> 13:57.271
- Okay.
- Where you pull it down,

13:57.314 --> 13:59.882
and you stitch it up.
It's a thing.

13:59.926 --> 14:01.928
- Oh, it's possible.
- It's possible.

14:01.971 --> 14:04.408
Okay, so did you go in
the next day for post-op check?

14:04.452 --> 14:06.889
The next--Yes, I did.
My, uh, tummy,

14:06.933 --> 14:08.325
it was already, like,
black and blue.

14:08.369 --> 14:10.893
This is one of those
tick-tock, tick-tock moments.

14:10.937 --> 14:13.591
I'll tell you why.
You have a problem.

14:13.635 --> 14:15.376
It's a reduction
of blood supply.

14:15.419 --> 14:17.117
The surgeon was going
like this to my stomach,

14:17.160 --> 14:18.596
and it was water.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.163
There's fluid
underneath the skin.

14:20.207 --> 14:21.556
So she has a seroma, too, now.

14:21.599 --> 14:23.123
He told me that he would take
a syringe,

14:23.166 --> 14:26.126
take out the fluid,
and he took almost a gallon.

14:26.169 --> 14:29.912
A seroma is clear yellow fluid
that occurs post-operatively

14:29.956 --> 14:33.829
underneath the skin
of a tummy tuck

14:33.873 --> 14:36.963
that could potentially impair
wound healing.

14:37.006 --> 14:42.490
In Bianca's case, most likely
had she had drains placed,

14:42.533 --> 14:44.840
it would have helped
to prevent the seroma,

14:44.884 --> 14:47.887
and the complication that she
ultimately developed.

14:47.930 --> 14:53.153
Sometimes, you've gotta dive
on a grenade to save the day.

14:53.196 --> 14:55.155
- ...back to New York.
- Did he address the black skin?

14:55.198 --> 14:56.591
No.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.071
By the way,
the fluid's not the problem now.

14:58.114 --> 15:00.464
- No, it's the tissue.
- I mean, it's a small problem.

15:00.508 --> 15:02.989
The tissue, yeah.
A week later, I'm sleeping,

15:03.032 --> 15:05.382
'cause that's all I did
was sleep.

15:05.426 --> 15:06.688
I was in so much pain.

15:06.731 --> 15:08.037
Was the skin getting darker
during this time?

15:08.081 --> 15:10.257
It was--It was dark. Yes.

15:10.300 --> 15:11.606
It's dying.

15:11.649 --> 15:15.349
He comes, and all I feel is him,
"Bianca, get up."

15:15.392 --> 15:18.178
And as I touched her,
she was ice-cold.

15:18.221 --> 15:19.657
- Mm.
- And pale.

15:19.701 --> 15:21.616
She went to get up,
and she couldn't hold herself,

15:21.659 --> 15:23.226
and she dropped back down.

15:23.270 --> 15:24.575
I come home, and I told her,

15:24.619 --> 15:25.663
"I'm gonna take you
to the hospital."

15:25.707 --> 15:27.883
You were close.
You were close.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.799
Thank God Jose came home early.

15:30.842 --> 15:32.932
If it wasn't
for him, I wouldn't be here.

15:36.196 --> 15:38.198
The surgeon promptly takes you
down to the O.R.

15:38.241 --> 15:39.764
and does what?

15:39.808 --> 15:42.898
They said, "We have to do
surgery on her right now."

15:42.942 --> 15:45.640
They told me I had
skin necrosis,

15:45.683 --> 15:48.121
and it was poisoning my blood.

15:48.164 --> 15:52.429
So they removed the dead tissue
and left me with an open wound,

15:52.473 --> 15:54.257
a big hole.

15:54.301 --> 15:56.216
And then I had to a skin graft.

15:56.259 --> 15:58.392
- Where'd they get it from?
- My left thigh.

15:58.435 --> 16:00.568
- Big skin graft.
- Yes.

16:00.611 --> 16:03.223
So this is affecting
your daily activity,

16:03.266 --> 16:04.789
exercise, health, uh...

16:04.833 --> 16:07.183
I can't work out the way
I used to work out with him.

16:07.227 --> 16:09.446
I can't lift my arms up because
it feels like it's ripping.

16:09.490 --> 16:13.189
Okay. There's cosmetic and
functional issues, obviously.

16:13.233 --> 16:14.930
What would you like to see here?

16:14.974 --> 16:16.888
I would like
to feel normal again.

16:16.932 --> 16:19.500
My daughter used to tickle me
with my husband in bed.

16:19.543 --> 16:20.718
You know,
do things like that again,

16:20.762 --> 16:23.460
be able to hug my daughter.
Pick her up.

16:25.636 --> 16:26.942
To be able to wear
a bathing suit

16:26.986 --> 16:30.032
without people looking at me
or judging me.

16:35.516 --> 16:38.780
Needless to say,

16:38.823 --> 16:41.435
you have a heck of a problem.

16:41.478 --> 16:43.045
The question is,
can we fix it?

16:45.004 --> 16:49.356
Now I have the most beautiful,
perfect-looking vagina.

16:49.399 --> 16:50.574
I have to be very careful
how I sit,

16:50.618 --> 16:54.448
how I walk, how I shower because

16:54.491 --> 16:56.711
I just get turned on
very easily.

16:56.754 --> 16:58.800
Wow.

16:58.843 --> 16:59.757
is that fungus?
What happened?

16:59.801 --> 17:01.107
Actually, it looks like cotton.

17:01.150 --> 17:04.023
I found gauze
from the previous surgery.

17:04.066 --> 17:06.808
That can cause
a chronic infection,

17:06.851 --> 17:08.157
and you can lose vision.

17:09.506 --> 17:12.074
<i>♪ I wanna be perfect</i>

17:12.118 --> 17:14.294
Stand up for a sec.
Can we take this off?

17:14.337 --> 17:15.643
- Do you mind?
- Sure.

17:15.686 --> 17:21.344
All right. So in order
to reconstruct this area,

17:21.388 --> 17:25.566
and to make it hopefully
less tender and look better,

17:25.609 --> 17:27.089
we have to take
the skin graft off.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.570
But now what?
We have a big hole.

17:29.613 --> 17:31.441
For Bianca's surgery,
we need to do what we call

17:31.485 --> 17:34.662
a plastic surgery
to recreate the defect.

17:34.705 --> 17:37.708
If you're going to remove
the skin graft,

17:37.752 --> 17:41.451
you actually have
a larger reconstructed defect.

17:41.495 --> 17:44.106
That's why once we remove
the skin graft,

17:44.150 --> 17:46.326
we'll really know
the actual size of the opening

17:46.369 --> 17:48.328
that we have to close.

17:48.371 --> 17:53.028
I need as much loose tissue
as I can possibly get.

17:53.072 --> 17:56.292
I can lift this up
and pull it down.

17:56.336 --> 17:58.468
I can lift this up
and pull it up

17:58.512 --> 18:01.080
and meet somewhere
in the middle, right?

18:01.123 --> 18:02.472
The question is, can I do that?

18:02.516 --> 18:05.649
Don't be surprised if we end up
with an open area

18:05.693 --> 18:10.001
that we need dressing changes
and a wound VAC.

18:10.045 --> 18:11.481
I'll take a detour.

18:11.525 --> 18:15.485
No problem. That happens
all the time with these cases.

18:15.529 --> 18:21.317
So this is a true high-risk
abdominal wall reconstruction.

18:21.361 --> 18:23.276
I'm willing to take
those risks on.

18:23.319 --> 18:25.147
Do you think she should do this

18:25.191 --> 18:26.931
based on what
we're talking about?

18:26.975 --> 18:30.500
I do. I feel confident knowing
that she's in your hands.

18:30.544 --> 18:33.329
But the real answer comes
how she feels, of course.

18:33.373 --> 18:35.244
- How do you feel?
- Um...

18:35.288 --> 18:36.985
I scared you, right?

18:37.028 --> 18:39.161
- Yes, you did.
- I was traumatized.

18:39.205 --> 18:40.641
Yeah, big-time.

18:40.684 --> 18:43.209
I'm scared for my life
all over again,

18:43.252 --> 18:45.994
and I'm scared I can catch
skin necrosis.

18:46.037 --> 18:47.300
I'm scared I can die.

18:47.343 --> 18:50.825
I'm scared that this procedure
can go wrong.

18:50.868 --> 18:53.175
You know, it's the tough choice.

18:53.219 --> 18:54.655
I mean, you wanna take
this journey with me

18:54.698 --> 18:57.353
and go down this road and try
and make it look better?

19:00.139 --> 19:01.183
I would love for it
to look better.

19:01.227 --> 19:02.358
I know.

19:02.402 --> 19:03.490
I would love for you
to help me.

19:03.533 --> 19:04.926
All right. Let's do this thing.

19:04.969 --> 19:06.493
- Let's do it.
- I'm up for it.

19:06.536 --> 19:08.059
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

19:11.933 --> 19:14.327
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

19:14.370 --> 19:15.545
- Doctor, Doctor.
- Hi.

19:15.589 --> 19:17.330
- How are you?
- Hi. How you doing?

19:17.373 --> 19:19.462
- How you feeling?
- All right.

19:19.506 --> 19:21.551
All right, so you know Peng.

19:21.595 --> 19:24.293
Then this is Dr. Massry.
We have done

19:24.337 --> 19:26.121
a lot of these complex cases together,

19:26.165 --> 19:27.775
and this is one of his fortes.

19:27.818 --> 19:32.736
Again, this is very complex,
risky surgery.

19:38.438 --> 19:40.048
For Gina's surgery today,

19:40.091 --> 19:42.529
my team and I will begin by
removing the scarred down skin

19:42.572 --> 19:44.879
under her right eye
to free up the nerve

19:44.922 --> 19:46.707
and hopefully stop her pain.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.752
Then we are gonna harvest tissue
from her stomach

19:48.796 --> 19:53.192
to create a dermal fat graft
and rotate the malar fat pad

19:53.235 --> 19:55.803
from her lower cheek
to fill in the defect

19:55.846 --> 19:57.283
and give her volume.

19:57.326 --> 20:01.025
Finally, Dr. Massry will perform
a closed canthoplasty

20:01.069 --> 20:04.464
so that the corner of her eye
is symmetric to the left side.

20:04.507 --> 20:06.596
All right, here we go.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.163
We're making our incision now.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.426
So here's the tissue coming out.

20:10.470 --> 20:12.298
So here's bone right here.

20:12.341 --> 20:16.302
That means that this infection
and granulomatous tissue

20:16.345 --> 20:17.955
eroded into the bone.

20:17.999 --> 20:21.481
In addition, there's a lot
of pus and debris and junk.

20:21.524 --> 20:24.048
What is this right here?
Look. Look at that.

20:24.092 --> 20:25.528
Ohh.

20:25.572 --> 20:28.052
It's like a big fungal ball.
Go ahead and pull it out.

20:28.096 --> 20:29.967
Is that fungus,
or what is that?

20:30.011 --> 20:31.447
Actually, it looks like cotton.

20:31.491 --> 20:33.841
We're gonna have to make sure
we irrigate that well.

20:33.884 --> 20:37.323
Thank God I found that gauze
from the previous surgery.

20:37.366 --> 20:41.457
That can cause a chronic
indolent, horrible infection

20:41.501 --> 20:44.634
that could eat away
her whole maxillary sinus.

20:44.678 --> 20:47.420
The eye then can get infected,
and you can lose vision.

20:47.463 --> 20:49.335
All right, Dr. Massry,
take that belly fat.

20:49.378 --> 20:56.167
So I'm going to put fat down
for volume and coverage.

20:56.211 --> 20:58.822
So I'm now cutting the graft.

20:58.866 --> 21:01.347
All right,
this is gonna be great.

21:01.390 --> 21:03.566
Our next step is
the mid face-lift.

21:03.610 --> 21:06.177
So in essence we're bringing
all this tissue deep below,

21:06.221 --> 21:07.483
lifting it up.

21:07.527 --> 21:09.311
This is the final step.

21:09.355 --> 21:11.705
Dr. Massry will do
a canthoplasty

21:11.748 --> 21:15.186
where he uses a stitch to lift
up the corner of the eye

21:15.230 --> 21:16.840
on the right so that it matches

21:16.884 --> 21:19.365
the corner of the eye
on the left.

21:19.408 --> 21:20.496
I gotta tell you,
that looks pretty good.

21:20.540 --> 21:22.672
- It does.
- We didn't see any silicone,

21:22.716 --> 21:24.631
which hopefully means
no more granulomas.

21:24.674 --> 21:26.154
Yeah, take a look
at that projection.

21:26.197 --> 21:28.765
It's pretty impressive.
This whole case is a home run.

21:28.809 --> 21:30.854
- I think it's a grand slam.
- Yeah.

21:35.642 --> 21:38.035
- All right.
- What do you have for me today?

21:38.079 --> 21:40.342
So...very interesting patient

21:40.386 --> 21:43.432
who has been
on an interesting journey.

21:43.476 --> 21:45.695
Her name is Jessica.
We know this patient.

21:45.739 --> 21:47.523
Jessica has had many, many
surgical procedures

21:47.567 --> 21:49.220
which she'll tell us about.

21:49.264 --> 21:50.439
- Jessica.
- Yeah.

21:50.483 --> 21:52.441
- Jessica has abs.
- Yeah.

21:52.485 --> 21:54.356
But they sort of look like
surgical abs, don't they?

21:54.400 --> 21:55.705
Yeah.

21:55.749 --> 21:59.535
And she has issues regarding
her breasts.

21:59.579 --> 22:01.711
Can you please send in Jessica?

22:01.755 --> 22:03.887
- Jessica.
- Hello. Good morning.

22:03.931 --> 22:06.803
- How are you?
- I'm very well. Thanks.

22:06.847 --> 22:08.631
How are you, Jessica?
Dr. Nassif.

22:08.675 --> 22:10.241
- I am delighted.
- Nice to meet you.

22:10.285 --> 22:11.460
Wonderful to see you again.

22:11.504 --> 22:13.375
Actually, you have already
met me before.

22:13.419 --> 22:15.203
- Yes, I remember.
- Hello. How are you?

22:15.246 --> 22:17.379
How are you? So nice--
You look wonderful, by the way.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.512
I'm very well.
Well, I'm better than ever.

22:19.555 --> 22:21.992
- I can see that.
- Don't you really recall?

22:22.036 --> 22:24.908
Jessica's transformation
is either so dramatic

22:24.952 --> 22:29.173
and so effective that Paul
doesn't recognize her,

22:29.217 --> 22:31.567
or he's just incredibly stupid.

22:31.611 --> 22:34.091
Or both may be true.

22:34.135 --> 22:37.094
I was a man before,
and my name was Rodrigo Alves.

22:39.009 --> 22:40.620
- Rodrigo!
- It was Rodrigo.

22:40.663 --> 22:42.230
I warned you not to touch
your nose anymore.

22:42.273 --> 22:44.101
- Yes.
- If you let one of these doctors

22:44.145 --> 22:47.583
touch your nose now, this...
will turn black

22:47.627 --> 22:50.194
and then die and fall off.

22:50.238 --> 22:52.588
I had everything done. Look.

22:52.632 --> 22:55.069
- From head to toe.
- Like, like everything.

22:55.112 --> 22:57.550
- Everything.
- Wow.

22:57.593 --> 22:59.682
It is pretty surprising, right?

22:59.726 --> 23:02.206
- This is <i>very</i> surprising.
- It is a surprise to everyone.

23:02.250 --> 23:03.599
Yes.

23:03.643 --> 23:06.428
This is
an incredible transformation.

23:06.472 --> 23:09.823
Jessica does not
look like Rodrigo.

23:09.866 --> 23:12.260
Throughout the years, I've had
a lot of plastic surgery...

23:12.303 --> 23:13.522
- Yes.
- Oh, yes.

23:13.566 --> 23:15.350
- ...including rib removal.
- Yeah.

23:15.394 --> 23:18.440
So many rhinoplasty
to fix my breathing.

23:18.484 --> 23:19.963
- Yeah.
- But I've kind of given up

23:20.007 --> 23:22.966
on my nose, so now I have just
been concentrating,

23:23.010 --> 23:24.968
focusing on my transition.
- Right.

23:25.012 --> 23:28.276
So nine weeks ago, I had
my gender reassignment surgery.

23:28.319 --> 23:29.843
- Whoa.
- And now I have the most

23:29.886 --> 23:33.412
beautiful,
perfect-looking vagina.

23:33.455 --> 23:34.717
Aw.

23:34.761 --> 23:36.806
- Where did you have that done?
- In Thailand.

23:36.850 --> 23:39.287
- Tell us, what do they do?
- It's unbelievable.

23:39.330 --> 23:40.767
- After the penile inversion...
- Mm-hmm.

23:40.810 --> 23:45.206
...the doctors,
they use a layer of the abs

23:45.249 --> 23:46.642
called the peritoneum.

23:46.686 --> 23:49.819
So they use that to create
the line of my vagina.

23:49.863 --> 23:52.822
So my vagina--
it is self-lubricate,

23:52.866 --> 23:54.302
which is wonderful.
- Really? Yes.

23:54.345 --> 23:58.828
And the doctor--he kept
all the sensorial nerves...

23:58.872 --> 24:01.918
- You're kidding.
- ...from my previous genital.

24:01.962 --> 24:05.182
- So I have sensation effect.
- You're kidding me.

24:05.226 --> 24:08.751
I have to be very careful
how I sit, how I walk,

24:08.795 --> 24:13.190
how I shower because I just get
turned on very easily.

24:13.234 --> 24:15.018
Wow!

24:15.062 --> 24:18.413
it is the best surgery
that I have had in my life.

24:18.457 --> 24:22.591
End of the day, no matter how
you feel about transgenderism,

24:22.635 --> 24:26.029
it takes a lot of bravery,
there's a lot of risks,

24:26.073 --> 24:30.207
and you have to feel really good
for Jessica's courage

24:30.251 --> 24:34.211
and overall state of mind,
so I'm really happy for her.

24:34.255 --> 24:35.604
So what are your goals
with your breasts, then,

24:35.648 --> 24:37.127
that you're seeing him for?
- Right.

24:37.171 --> 24:40.391
They look good now because
I have a push-up bra.

24:40.435 --> 24:42.089
But if I take this bra off,

24:42.132 --> 24:45.135
the breasts--they are low
and they're spread apart.

24:45.179 --> 24:48.051
I would like my breasts
to look bigger

24:48.095 --> 24:52.969
than what they look right now,
higher, and close together.

24:53.013 --> 24:56.973
And I would like to go up
to 1,250.

24:57.017 --> 25:00.629
I believe if I go bigger,
you're gonna be able

25:00.673 --> 25:02.544
to fill in this space
that I have here,

25:02.588 --> 25:04.111
which is quite big.

25:04.154 --> 25:06.461
Remember, the more and more
work you do on your breasts,

25:06.505 --> 25:09.072
especially the larger you go,

25:09.116 --> 25:12.554
the more complications again.
It's gonna start all over again.

25:12.598 --> 25:15.514
I just wanted to perfect
the female that I became.

25:15.557 --> 25:16.993
- Mm-hmm. Totally.
- Makes sense.

25:17.037 --> 25:18.821
There you go.

25:18.865 --> 25:21.563
I started finding
some unusual things.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.478
- Really?
- I found a foreign body,

25:23.522 --> 25:25.698
like a piece of gauze...
- What?

25:25.741 --> 25:27.830
- ...in your sinus.
- Oh, my God.

25:27.874 --> 25:30.137
Jeez, the defect just keeps
getting bigger.

25:30.180 --> 25:31.660
How are we gonna get
this down to there?

25:31.704 --> 25:34.750
This is never gonna happen. Goddamnit.

25:36.317 --> 25:38.406
<i>♪ I wanna be perfect</i>

25:38.449 --> 25:40.930
- Hello.
- Hello again.

25:40.974 --> 25:42.062
Let's see what's going on.

25:42.105 --> 25:45.108
Let's take a look at your mounds

25:45.152 --> 25:48.329
relative to your arm positions,
okay?

25:48.372 --> 25:51.288
So stand up for a second.
Okay, hair back.

25:51.332 --> 25:53.377
Paul, look at her breast mounds.

25:53.421 --> 25:56.293
Are they at the elbow,
or are they somewhere

25:56.337 --> 25:58.818
in the mid arm point?
- Mid arm point.

25:58.861 --> 26:01.342
Okay, have a seat.
Let me tell you what I think.

26:01.385 --> 26:04.214
The truth is,
your breast mounds

26:04.258 --> 26:06.216
are positioned where
they're supposed to be,

26:06.260 --> 26:09.045
relative to the rest
of your body.

26:09.089 --> 26:13.920
Now, if you, for example, close
off the bottom of the pockets...

26:13.963 --> 26:16.096
- Mm-hmm.
- ...to put 'em up higher.

26:16.139 --> 26:17.663
- Mm-hmm.
- What would that do

26:17.706 --> 26:19.142
to the distance between
the nipple and the crease?

26:19.186 --> 26:20.927
Where would the nipples be
relative to the mound?

26:20.970 --> 26:22.842
Oh, the nipple would go down.

26:22.885 --> 26:24.191
Yes.

26:24.234 --> 26:26.019
It's an abnormal look.
It's a weird look.

26:26.062 --> 26:28.325
- Yeah.
- Now what if I pulled

26:28.369 --> 26:31.328
your mounds closer
by closing off the sides?

26:31.372 --> 26:32.329
Mm-hmm.

26:32.373 --> 26:33.504
What would it do
to the nipples?

26:33.548 --> 26:36.464
They would be
even more far apart.

26:36.507 --> 26:37.639
Exactly.

26:37.683 --> 26:41.687
Nipples and breast mounds
are kind of like

26:41.730 --> 26:44.080
Paul and dinner.

26:44.124 --> 26:46.430
When you move the mound over,

26:46.474 --> 26:49.303
the nipple goes
in the opposite direction.

26:49.346 --> 26:52.654
When you're at dinner with Paul
and the check comes,

26:52.698 --> 26:56.484
Paul also goes
in the opposite direction.

26:56.527 --> 26:59.661
So no matter what
breast surgery I do,

26:59.705 --> 27:02.490
the nipples will still be
too far apart

27:02.533 --> 27:05.101
or too low, would not be
positioned correctly.

27:05.145 --> 27:10.150
Correct. Now if you go bigger,
if you were to go very big,

27:10.193 --> 27:12.239
you would get
more upper fullness.

27:12.282 --> 27:15.155
They would be closer
just because they're bigger.

27:15.198 --> 27:16.678
- They're bigger.
- Yeah.

27:16.722 --> 27:19.899
But do you really wanna go
to that level of caricature?

27:19.942 --> 27:21.204
I don't want to be seen as that.

27:21.248 --> 27:24.077
I'm much more than the visuals
that you see.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.687
I'm interested in being
a beautiful woman

27:25.731 --> 27:27.733
and live a happy life.

27:27.776 --> 27:30.736
So in other words,
I should just continue using

27:30.779 --> 27:33.216
the push-up bras?

27:33.260 --> 27:34.827
That's gonna be the best--
best idea for you.

27:34.870 --> 27:37.699
Even when I go to the beach,
wear bikinis with push-up bra?

27:37.743 --> 27:42.661
They make bikinis that have
built-in push-up bras in them.

27:42.704 --> 27:44.184
I haven't seen it.

27:44.227 --> 27:45.489
Girl, you gotta go shopping.

27:45.533 --> 27:46.839
Girl.

27:55.761 --> 27:57.371
How are you?

27:57.414 --> 27:59.286
Uh, actually pretty good.

27:59.329 --> 28:00.983
Do you mind if I touch
your upper eyelid?

28:01.027 --> 28:02.550
- I just wanna feel that.
- Yeah, it's fine.

28:02.593 --> 28:04.291
It's soft, and the lymphatic's
not draining right now.

28:04.334 --> 28:07.773
All right, remember you had
an area of necrotic skin,

28:07.816 --> 28:09.426
and that was really bad.

28:09.470 --> 28:11.777
Once I cut out that tissue,

28:11.820 --> 28:13.474
that's when I started finding
some unusual things.

28:13.517 --> 28:14.823
Really?

28:14.867 --> 28:17.913
I found a foreign body
like a piece of gauze...

28:17.957 --> 28:19.262
- What?
- ...in your sinus.

28:19.306 --> 28:21.787
- Oh, my gosh.
- So we took that out.

28:21.830 --> 28:24.093
How in the heck did I get gauze
in there?

28:24.137 --> 28:25.878
Probably from one
of the other procedures.

28:25.921 --> 28:28.663
How is the pain you had?

28:28.707 --> 28:30.447
- Yeah, it's a lot better.
- Really?

28:30.491 --> 28:32.580
Yes, I'm actually able
to sleep now.

28:32.623 --> 28:33.973
We're not out of the woods yet,
because one,

28:34.016 --> 28:35.757
I don't want that wound
right here pulling apart.

28:35.801 --> 28:37.193
Mnh-mnh.

28:37.237 --> 28:38.412
I don't want you
getting an infection.

28:38.455 --> 28:40.762
Did you see any silicone
at all or no?

28:40.806 --> 28:42.285
No, I didn't see that.

28:42.329 --> 28:45.506
I'm just really grateful
that I have a chance now

28:45.549 --> 28:48.074
to reclaim my life because, um,
things are starting

28:48.117 --> 28:49.423
to look dismal.

28:49.466 --> 28:52.687
This is the best I've felt
in a long time,

28:52.731 --> 28:54.080
so I'm just really crossing
my fingers

28:54.123 --> 28:58.562
that this is finally the end
of my personal hell.

28:58.606 --> 28:59.955
I've been in this game
a long time.

28:59.999 --> 29:02.349
- Yeah.
- This is really...

29:02.392 --> 29:03.611
- It's amazing.
- I'm really impressed.

29:03.654 --> 29:06.440
I mean, this is, like,
super sophisticated.

29:06.483 --> 29:08.094
This is a giant step
in the right direction.

29:08.137 --> 29:12.098
I know. Yeah, thank you
so much. Thank you, thank you.

29:16.842 --> 29:19.148
- Bianca, how are you?
- Good. How are you?

29:19.192 --> 29:21.847
- Good. You know Heidi.
- Yeah.

29:21.890 --> 29:24.632
I know what to do.
I have a great plan.

29:24.675 --> 29:25.938
I just have no idea
if the plan's gonna work,

29:25.981 --> 29:29.028
because it's all fun and games
until you try

29:29.071 --> 29:32.161
to close the wound,
and you can't get it closed.

29:32.205 --> 29:35.295
So that's why this case is
so difficult and so high risk.

29:35.338 --> 29:36.818
- You ready to do this?
- Yes, I'm ready.

29:36.862 --> 29:37.950
- Hey, let's do this.
- I'm ready.

29:37.993 --> 29:39.212
Let's make it good, okay?

29:39.255 --> 29:40.866
I've done this kind
of problem before,

29:40.909 --> 29:44.521
never to this great a degree.
I mean, truth be told, we are

29:44.565 --> 29:47.829
pushing the envelope today,
but there's no other choice.

29:51.833 --> 29:54.053
<i>
For Bianca's surgery,</i>

29:54.096 --> 29:56.229
<i>I'm going to start</i> <i>
by making an incision</i>

29:56.272 --> 29:58.318
<i>around the belly button to
release it from the scar tissue</i>

29:58.361 --> 30:01.669
<i>and reduce it</i> <i>
down to a smaller size.</i>

30:01.712 --> 30:03.323
<i>Next, I will remove</i> <i>
the skin graft,</i>

30:03.366 --> 30:05.238
<i>recreating the defect.</i>

30:05.281 --> 30:07.414
<i>Then I'm going to elevate</i> <i>
her skin</i>

30:07.457 --> 30:08.894
<i>and tighten</i> <i>
the abdominal wall muscles</i>

30:08.937 --> 30:13.376
<i>to try to create as much</i> <i>
skin laxity as possible.</i>

30:13.420 --> 30:14.943
<i>Finally, I'll close her up,</i>

30:14.987 --> 30:18.164
<i>hopefully leaving Bianca</i> <i>
with a scar-free stomach.</i>

30:18.207 --> 30:21.689
Big question mark is how big
is this defect going to be

30:21.732 --> 30:24.474
once I've removed
that actual skin graft?

30:24.518 --> 30:28.000
So the defect--it's 15 by 6 1/2.

30:28.043 --> 30:30.219
All right, so we're releasing
the belly button

30:30.263 --> 30:34.354
and shrinking it down to size. Okay.

30:34.397 --> 30:36.747
So this is the skin graft, removed.

30:36.791 --> 30:39.011
Now look at the size
of the defect that we have now.

30:39.054 --> 30:40.360
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

30:40.403 --> 30:43.537
So it was this.

30:43.580 --> 30:46.975
And now it's...27...

30:47.019 --> 30:49.195
by 12.

30:49.238 --> 30:51.806
So it's almost double.
Damn it.

30:51.850 --> 30:54.809
There are two opposing issues
going on.

30:54.853 --> 30:57.943
On the one hand,
I need enough loose skin

30:57.986 --> 31:00.162
to close the defect.

31:00.206 --> 31:03.818
On the other hand, I need to
leave enough blood supply

31:03.862 --> 31:05.733
so that the wound heals.

31:05.776 --> 31:07.909
Jeez, the defect just
keeps getting bigger.

31:07.953 --> 31:12.914
But each artery that I sacrifice
in lifting up more tissue

31:12.958 --> 31:14.829
to get more elasticity

31:14.873 --> 31:17.571
sacrifices
potential blood supply

31:17.614 --> 31:19.660
that will allow
this wound to heal.

31:19.703 --> 31:22.924
This is a push-pull situation.
It's very dangerous,

31:22.968 --> 31:24.708
and it's very risky.

31:24.752 --> 31:26.710
How are we gonna get this
down to there?

31:26.754 --> 31:28.277
This is never gonna happen.

31:28.321 --> 31:30.366
Seeing your face look great

31:30.410 --> 31:33.108
and then slowly do worse
every single month

31:33.152 --> 31:35.589
has been really hard.

31:35.632 --> 31:39.245
That kind of really erodes
your spirit.

31:39.288 --> 31:41.073
All right, so let's look at it.

31:41.116 --> 31:42.726
I actually really don't wanna
look at it because

31:42.770 --> 31:46.426
I'm just afraid of seeing
that scar again.

31:46.469 --> 31:48.297
Oh, my God.

31:49.559 --> 31:51.997
<i>♪ I wanna be perfect</i>

31:52.040 --> 31:54.564
You normally don't see
this much scarring up here

31:54.608 --> 31:57.916
on a redo, but this is
a very thin abdominal wall.

31:57.959 --> 32:01.180
So it's very heavily liposuctioned.

32:01.223 --> 32:03.965
That's clearly why
that all this skin died.

32:04.009 --> 32:06.925
When you do a tummy tuck,
you do some liposuction,

32:06.968 --> 32:09.275
but you're never supposed to do liposuction

32:09.318 --> 32:12.539
in the primary area
that supplies the blood supply

32:12.582 --> 32:15.629
to the healing tummy tuck wound.

32:15.672 --> 32:19.198
If you do, you can reduce
the blood supply substantially,

32:19.241 --> 32:21.722
and the tissue will just die.

32:21.765 --> 32:24.420
She thought that the skin died
because the surgeon

32:24.464 --> 32:27.075
didn't put drains in,
but in reality,

32:27.119 --> 32:30.339
the flap was just
overly liposuctioned.

32:30.383 --> 32:32.167
Now that we've elevated
the flap,

32:32.211 --> 32:34.343
the best way to get more laxity

32:34.387 --> 32:36.258
is to flatten
the abdominal wall.

32:36.302 --> 32:39.044
Whenever you do a tummy tuck,
you tighten the muscle.

32:39.087 --> 32:42.221
I can see evidence that
the surgeon previously

32:42.264 --> 32:44.571
tightened the lower portion
of the muscle,

32:44.614 --> 32:46.442
and the very top

32:46.486 --> 32:49.619
but missed mostly two-thirds
of the central area.

32:49.663 --> 32:53.623
Now the more I tighten it,
the flatter it can become,

32:53.667 --> 32:55.538
the more loose skin I get,

32:55.582 --> 32:58.715
and the easier I can close
the abdominal wall defect.

32:58.759 --> 33:03.024
So his incompetence
is my good fortune in this case.

33:03.068 --> 33:05.157
All right, put the drains in.

33:05.200 --> 33:08.551
Big question is, will this
come down to here? Here we go.

33:10.075 --> 33:11.511
Nice.

33:11.554 --> 33:12.947
Can we do it?

33:15.254 --> 33:17.517
- Scar's low.
- Sweet.

33:17.560 --> 33:18.822
Excess tissue's removed.

33:18.866 --> 33:19.910
The skin graft
is completely gone.

33:19.954 --> 33:22.087
- The abdomen's flat.
- It's beautiful.

33:22.130 --> 33:25.177
And it's got good blood supply.
This should heal.

33:25.220 --> 33:26.787
It's really good.

33:26.830 --> 33:28.876
Let's close it up, okay?

33:35.274 --> 33:37.798
- Hello, you two.
- Hello.

33:37.841 --> 33:39.234
- Good to see you.
- Likewise.

33:39.278 --> 33:40.583
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

33:40.627 --> 33:42.063
Let's talk.

33:42.107 --> 33:44.326
The goal, obviously,
was to remove the skin graft.

33:44.370 --> 33:46.502
I went in there
and elevated everything up,

33:46.546 --> 33:49.288
and as I kept going higher and
higher and higher and higher,

33:49.331 --> 33:51.812
I could see it was very
diffusely scarred everywhere.

33:51.855 --> 33:55.642
So he way over-liposuctioned,
and that's why you lost

33:55.685 --> 33:58.210
all the blood supply down here,
and that's why it all died.

33:58.253 --> 34:00.342
All right, so let's look at it.

34:00.386 --> 34:02.083
I actually really don't wanna
look at it

34:02.127 --> 34:05.869
because I'm just afraid
of seeing that scar again.

34:05.913 --> 34:07.741
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, you do wanna look.

34:07.784 --> 34:09.177
- Oh, my God.
- And so I was able

34:09.221 --> 34:11.919
to remove the whole thing.
- It looks amazing.

34:18.926 --> 34:20.188
How much tension is on that?

34:20.232 --> 34:22.190
Because it looks like
it's, like, closed easy.

34:22.234 --> 34:24.758
Once I tightened the muscle,
got it flat,

34:24.801 --> 34:26.629
it gave me a lot of excess skin,

34:26.673 --> 34:29.197
and it's gonna be
under the bikini line,

34:29.241 --> 34:30.851
and it's gonna be awesome.

34:30.894 --> 34:34.637
I'm just lost for words.

34:34.681 --> 34:37.466
Thank you.

34:37.510 --> 34:39.120
You're welcome.

34:39.164 --> 34:41.383
This is why Paul and I
do this surgery.

34:41.427 --> 34:45.257
It's to take people who are
in hopeless situations,

34:45.300 --> 34:47.911
who have nearly
unfixable problems,

34:47.955 --> 34:50.653
and attempt to fix them.

34:50.697 --> 34:52.481
Booyakasha!

34:52.525 --> 34:54.570
You definitely have
magic hands.

34:54.614 --> 34:56.616
- You did nail it.
- That was a good one, huh?

34:56.659 --> 34:58.357
Oh, yeah, beautiful.

35:05.190 --> 35:07.148
Unfortunately, I'm heading back

35:07.192 --> 35:08.715
into surgery today.

35:08.758 --> 35:10.325
The last few months
have been difficult.

35:10.369 --> 35:12.327
The surgery looked great
in the beginning,

35:12.371 --> 35:15.722
and then I started to have
a recurrent swelling,

35:15.765 --> 35:20.640
which is a seroma in my cheek
that was minimal at first,

35:20.683 --> 35:24.034
and then it just got worse.

35:24.078 --> 35:27.081
And it's actually
pretty painful.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.517
And I've been having trouble

35:28.561 --> 35:32.260
with driving, reading,
and sleeping.

35:32.304 --> 35:36.395
That kind of really erodes
your spirit,

35:36.438 --> 35:39.615
and I'm nervous about it,
and, you know,

35:39.659 --> 35:43.271
anything's possible what could
be causing the swelling,

35:43.315 --> 35:48.015
so we'll see what
Dr. Nassif finds.

35:51.105 --> 35:54.630
Okay, so let's talk
about this for a minute.

35:54.674 --> 35:55.805
As you know,
she was doing great.

35:55.849 --> 35:57.590
Yep.

35:57.633 --> 35:58.808
And then she's had
recurrent problems.

35:58.852 --> 36:00.506
She's been out here
for the last month.

36:00.549 --> 36:02.116
- You two have drained her...
- Many, many times.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.118
Many, many times, so we thought

36:04.162 --> 36:05.554
that would help her
from crashing.

36:05.598 --> 36:06.947
Conservative treatment--
that's the way to go first.

36:06.990 --> 36:09.297
- Absolutely.
- It hasn't worked.

36:09.341 --> 36:11.212
Following Gina's surgery,

36:11.256 --> 36:13.301
she has had
multiple problems

36:13.345 --> 36:15.782
with what
we call recurrent seromas.

36:15.825 --> 36:17.305
For the last month, every week,

36:17.349 --> 36:19.438
we've been draining off
a seroma,

36:19.481 --> 36:22.658
which is so unusual, so my only
alternative at this point

36:22.702 --> 36:25.008
is to open her up again,
look for the caps of the seroma

36:25.052 --> 36:27.663
and remove it completely,
and hopefully,

36:27.707 --> 36:29.839
this will be it.

36:29.883 --> 36:31.493
- This junk is deep.
- Yeah.

36:31.537 --> 36:33.191
So this is where I can cut
in the nerves.

36:33.234 --> 36:34.714
I mean, you know,
she can wake up

36:34.757 --> 36:39.022
with her nerve paralyzed
in different parts of her face,

36:39.066 --> 36:41.111
and that's what scares me.

36:41.155 --> 36:43.984
- So you're in.
- Okay. So there's your cap.

36:44.027 --> 36:45.681
This capsule is huge.

36:45.725 --> 36:47.901
It's probably about the size
of my hand,

36:47.944 --> 36:49.729
and it looks like
a little monster.

36:49.772 --> 36:52.688
For some reason, Gina's body
is constantly making fluid

36:52.732 --> 36:56.475
in her cheek
following her first surgery.

36:56.518 --> 36:58.564
Once you keep
reaccumulating fluid,

36:58.607 --> 37:02.089
then what happens sometimes is
you make a capsule around it.

37:02.132 --> 37:05.353
Once you make the capsule,
the seroma keeps coming back.

37:05.397 --> 37:08.661
It becomes a vicious cycle.
Why is this happening?

37:08.704 --> 37:10.445
I don't know.

37:10.489 --> 37:12.447
This just goes to show you that
you can never predict

37:12.491 --> 37:14.884
what's gonna happen
in regards to healing

37:14.928 --> 37:17.278
after you operate on a face

37:17.322 --> 37:19.498
that has had silicone
injected in it.

37:19.541 --> 37:21.717
This is going straight down
the bone.

37:26.461 --> 37:31.553
The specimen will be called
right cheek mass.

37:33.251 --> 37:36.036
Whew! Son of a beeyotch.

37:36.079 --> 37:38.299
All right.
I need a 2-second break.

37:38.343 --> 37:42.564
So since we have a hole,
our next goal is to plug it.

37:42.608 --> 37:44.827
How much of that tissue moves?

37:44.871 --> 37:46.307
- This?
- All of it.

37:46.351 --> 37:48.657
Is there anything above
that we can stitch it to?

37:48.701 --> 37:49.963
Yeah.

37:50.006 --> 37:51.834
Now my next step
in the process

37:51.878 --> 37:53.923
is I need to restore some volume
back in Gina's face.

37:53.967 --> 37:56.143
So we're gonna have to do
another mid face-lift

37:56.186 --> 37:58.232
like I did in the first surgery.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.495
Once we do that,
we need to do a canthopexy

38:00.539 --> 38:02.932
on her right eye,
which is gonna hopefully

38:02.976 --> 38:07.372
lift up the corner to match
the good side--the left side.

38:07.415 --> 38:08.938
I really hope this works
for Gina.

38:08.982 --> 38:11.201
She's been through so much.

38:11.245 --> 38:12.551
I mean, listen,
if we can keep the eyelid

38:12.594 --> 38:15.118
from something like this,
I mean, it's just a win.

38:15.162 --> 38:17.425
It looks fantastic right now.

38:17.469 --> 38:19.384
- Okay. Great job.
- Thank you, Dr. Nassif.

38:19.427 --> 38:21.037
Thank you very much, everybody.

38:21.081 --> 38:22.952
In my career, I've never seen
anything like this.

38:22.996 --> 38:26.739
Very intense, a lot bigger
than the first surgery.

38:26.782 --> 38:28.306
I'm gonna send out the tissue
to pathology

38:28.349 --> 38:30.482
to see what's causing this.

38:30.525 --> 38:33.136
Is it gonna just be capsule or
old silicone still left in here?

38:33.180 --> 38:34.921
I still don't know.

38:34.964 --> 38:39.795
That tummy tuck surgery
had me left on death's door,

38:39.839 --> 38:43.625
but now a new body, a new me.
It's like, wow.

38:45.018 --> 38:46.149
Young lady, how are you?

38:46.193 --> 38:47.803
Well,
thanks for calling me young.

38:47.847 --> 38:50.632
Now especially young,
'cause you look fantastic.

38:51.981 --> 38:54.375
<i>♪ I wanna be perfect</i>

39:03.210 --> 39:06.169
- Hello.
- Young lady, how are you?

39:06.213 --> 39:07.867
Well, thanks for
calling me young.

39:07.910 --> 39:10.826
Now especially young,
'cause you look fantastic.

39:10.870 --> 39:12.219
How's your eye pain?

39:12.262 --> 39:14.090
My pain has gone down significantly.

39:14.134 --> 39:19.357
It's almost gone, and so I don't
have that horrible, just agony.

39:19.400 --> 39:20.314
Mm-hmm.

39:20.358 --> 39:21.881
Good.

39:21.924 --> 39:25.537
So just got the pathology back.
It just was foreign body.

39:25.580 --> 39:28.148
So that must mean that a little
bit of that old silicone

39:28.191 --> 39:32.718
you had injected caused
this massive weird reaction.

39:32.761 --> 39:34.284
- Wow.
- Wait until you see it.

39:34.328 --> 39:35.721
So the tissue
looks pretty healthy.

39:35.764 --> 39:40.552
Wow, it looks
totally unbelievable.

39:40.595 --> 39:44.338
And it's looking better.
Like, even morning to night,

39:44.382 --> 39:47.428
there's just, like, improvements
like within eight hours,

39:47.472 --> 39:51.998
and it's just--I'm just...
unbelievably happy.

39:52.041 --> 39:54.696
Silicone can be impossible
to remove,

39:54.740 --> 39:57.395
but thanks to Dr. Nassif,

39:57.438 --> 40:00.049
we have it removed
in the cheek area.

40:00.093 --> 40:01.921
My energy level is increasing,

40:01.964 --> 40:05.315
and actually my mood
has gotten better.

40:05.359 --> 40:07.013
My hair loss has stopped,

40:07.056 --> 40:11.017
and actually, my hair is
starting to grow back.

40:11.060 --> 40:14.107
My thought process is, um,
actually getting faster.

40:14.150 --> 40:16.457
I mean, it's just a miracle.

40:16.501 --> 40:19.504
I was having all this
really bad joint swelling,

40:19.547 --> 40:21.027
and it's gone.

40:21.070 --> 40:24.944
I was having, like,
daily nausea, and it's gone.

40:24.987 --> 40:27.642
It's just life-changing.

40:27.686 --> 40:30.340
I think that this is
the highlight

40:30.384 --> 40:33.387
of just such a, you know,
rough part of my life.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.520
And this is why we warn patients
all the time.

40:35.563 --> 40:38.479
Don't have anything illegal
injected in your face

40:38.523 --> 40:39.785
or your body...
- Mm-hmm.

40:39.828 --> 40:42.091
...because we don't know
the long-term effects,

40:42.135 --> 40:44.920
and it really ruined you.
It destroyed your life.

40:44.964 --> 40:46.226
- Yeah.
- But here's the horrible thing.

40:46.269 --> 40:48.010
We still see in our practice
all the time,

40:48.054 --> 40:51.536
patients that still do it
day in and day out.

40:51.579 --> 40:53.929
Oh, all the time.

40:53.973 --> 40:55.409
You would think
after all these years

40:55.453 --> 40:57.890
of us warning people not to
inject foreign substances

40:57.933 --> 41:01.023
from hardware stores
or plumbing supply stores

41:01.067 --> 41:03.373
that we'd see less.
We see more.

41:03.417 --> 41:05.463
But see, I didn't know this was
happening to me,

41:05.506 --> 41:06.638
and that's the thing.

41:06.681 --> 41:08.596
- And hopefully, it's over.
- I hope so.

41:08.640 --> 41:09.902
Let's hope.

41:09.945 --> 41:12.078
I'm just so grateful.
Thank you so much.

41:12.121 --> 41:14.602
I hope to God,
because I want you to start

41:14.646 --> 41:16.256
seeing patients again.
- Mm-hmm.

41:16.299 --> 41:18.301
Congratulations. It's good.
You're in a good place.

41:18.345 --> 41:20.478
So happy for you.

41:20.521 --> 41:22.044
I would like
to practice medicine again

41:22.088 --> 41:23.568
in the near future.

41:23.611 --> 41:27.615
I'm just so grateful that
they chose me to help.

41:27.659 --> 41:29.443
I mean, this will give hope
to so many people,

41:29.487 --> 41:32.098
'cause when you have, like,
hardly any hope,

41:32.141 --> 41:34.274
it's so hard,
and you have to look for, like,

41:34.317 --> 41:37.538
beauty every day, and now
when people see it,

41:37.582 --> 41:39.235
they'll actually have hope,

41:39.279 --> 41:41.934
and that's what we all need,
so thank you.

41:41.977 --> 41:43.413
Yeah, you look good.

41:43.457 --> 41:44.414
The only thing that
would make this better

41:44.458 --> 41:45.938
is if I had done this.
- Exactly.

41:45.981 --> 41:47.809
Don't inflate his ego.

41:52.553 --> 41:54.468
In the last three years,

41:54.512 --> 41:56.514
I felt like
I was living in a disaster.

41:56.557 --> 41:59.908
That tummy tuck surgery
had me left on death's door.

41:59.952 --> 42:03.956
I would've never thought I would
be in this position right now--

42:03.999 --> 42:06.045
a new body, a new me.

42:06.088 --> 42:09.962
It's like wow.
My scar's completely gone.

42:10.005 --> 42:13.574
There's nothing there.
I'm in disbelief.

42:13.618 --> 42:15.228
<i>♪ I never felt</i>

42:15.271 --> 42:19.145
<i>♪ Never felt this way</i>

42:19.188 --> 42:20.450
Oh, my God.

42:20.494 --> 42:22.322
The last time I saw you...

42:22.365 --> 42:26.152
...in a 2-piece was years ago.

42:26.195 --> 42:30.243
You look amazing, baby.

42:30.286 --> 42:31.636
Since the surgery
with Dr. Dubrow,

42:31.679 --> 42:33.072
she just smiles every minute.

42:33.115 --> 42:34.856
She has a walking glow.

42:34.900 --> 42:36.815
It's a complete
free, new Bianca.

42:36.858 --> 42:38.817
I'm speechless still
to this day.

42:38.860 --> 42:39.818
I feel like a hot mama.

42:39.861 --> 42:41.689
You are a hot mama.

42:41.733 --> 42:45.171
Before my surgery,
I had a scar on my stomach

42:45.214 --> 42:47.173
that I could fit
my whole hand in.

42:47.216 --> 42:49.044
The scar was so painful,

42:49.088 --> 42:51.569
it kept me from working out
with my husband.

42:51.612 --> 42:54.180
And I wasn't able to eat
big portions,

42:54.223 --> 42:57.052
but now thanks to Dr. Dubrow,
the scar's gone.

42:57.096 --> 42:59.098
I can work out,

42:59.141 --> 43:02.014
and I haven't had any pains
in my stomach at all.

43:02.057 --> 43:04.538
And now I love showing off
my tummy.

43:04.582 --> 43:09.325
To be myself is... I can't ask
for anything better.

43:09.369 --> 43:13.634
I cried so much,
and it is tears of joy now.

43:13.678 --> 43:16.028
Dr. Dubrow was able
to remove that scar.

43:16.071 --> 43:18.247
It was just removing
those three years

43:18.291 --> 43:20.206
and not letting me look back.

43:20.249 --> 43:24.689
He gave me a future,
being able to show myself off

43:24.732 --> 43:26.560
and be beautiful again.

43:26.604 --> 43:27.561
I'm so happy.

43:27.605 --> 43:28.910
Can't wait to see
that full tan.
