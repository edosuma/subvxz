M_I_SForEver

00:54.760 --> 00:57.738
I was told this was an
underground poker game.

00:57.740 --> 01:00.408
Now you boys take your metaphor seriously.

01:00.410 --> 01:01.243
Name?

01:02.320 --> 01:03.680
Mr. Andrew Jackson

01:05.960 --> 01:07.933
and his twin brother Andy Jackson.

01:20.703 --> 01:21.988
When I come back out this door,

01:21.990 --> 01:24.937
Ben Franklin might wanna
have a word with you.

01:24.939 --> 01:25.993
We savvy, big man?

01:42.909 --> 01:45.238
Is this seat taken?

01:45.240 --> 01:47.140
Depends on how much you got to lose.

01:54.770 --> 01:56.520
It's "The Allen Hour"

01:58.060 --> 02:00.223
with your host Allen Covington.

02:01.470 --> 02:06.403
Today, Allen welcomes
bestselling author HB Meyers.

02:09.259 --> 02:12.198
Well that excerpt was
from the first chapter

02:12.200 --> 02:14.025
of my next guest's new novel

02:14.027 --> 02:17.442
"The Man From Nowhere", HB Meyers.

02:17.444 --> 02:18.275
Thank you.

02:18.277 --> 02:19.108
Thank you for bein' here.

02:19.110 --> 02:20.918
Well thank you, Allen.

02:20.920 --> 02:22.018
Thank you.

02:22.020 --> 02:24.250
So Mr. Meyers, lemme jump right in

02:25.154 --> 02:26.648
and I realize this is a loaded question.

02:26.650 --> 02:28.727
It's kind of like asking you know,

02:28.729 --> 02:30.488
what's your favorite Beatles song?

02:30.490 --> 02:35.490
But out of the 89 novels you've written.

02:36.060 --> 02:39.188
I mean did I speak right, 89?

02:39.190 --> 02:40.021
I think so.

02:40.023 --> 02:42.653
But at my age, I can't remember
what I had for breakfast.

02:44.580 --> 02:46.168
Okay, so tell us.

02:46.170 --> 02:48.188
Which is your favorite
book you've ever written?

02:48.190 --> 02:49.238
Oh.

02:49.240 --> 02:50.073
Well

02:51.340 --> 02:53.268
I think every piece of art

02:53.270 --> 02:55.068
sort of becomes like a child to you,

02:55.070 --> 03:00.070
so I love each of them
equally and differently.

03:00.220 --> 03:05.220
But always my favorite book
is the one that I just wrote.

03:05.510 --> 03:08.148
And so I'd rather not talk
about the past right now,

03:08.150 --> 03:11.228
but I'd wanna focus on
"The Man From Nowhere."

03:11.230 --> 03:13.306
Which by the way, comes out Friday.

03:13.308 --> 03:16.048
Yes, it does.

03:16.050 --> 03:20.038
It's really my most
personal work, I would say.

03:20.040 --> 03:23.788
As you know, Allen, I'm a
military veteran myself.

03:23.790 --> 03:26.848
Military always has had a
special place in my heart.

03:26.850 --> 03:27.828
Sure.

03:27.830 --> 03:29.630
Unfortunately I think this country

03:31.079 --> 03:32.968
has failed our military veterans

03:32.970 --> 03:37.198
in providing the medical
attention that they need.

03:37.200 --> 03:42.200
And this book, I have
dedicated this book to a man

03:42.430 --> 03:46.358
who frankly saved my life in 1967.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.198
- Wow.
- Sergeant Frank Rogers.

03:48.200 --> 03:51.640
I intend to donate all the
proceeds from this novel

03:54.030 --> 03:56.408
to building a private medical facility

03:56.410 --> 03:59.398
that will help these American heroes,

03:59.400 --> 04:03.398
these men and women get the
medical care that they need

04:03.400 --> 04:05.298
and so richly deserve.

04:05.300 --> 04:08.878
If this book does well and the
good people in your audience

04:08.880 --> 04:11.341
and elsewhere go out and buy it, I...

04:11.343 --> 04:12.848
Well they better.

04:12.850 --> 04:13.918
Yeah, they better.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.941
If you love America,
you better buy my book.

04:18.672 --> 04:23.672
What a joke.

04:46.790 --> 04:49.428
Your father and I met at a fundraiser

04:49.430 --> 04:52.093
for a group that helps
veterans and their families.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.150
It seems to be his new thing.

04:56.550 --> 04:59.557
My hope is to partner
the coffee business

04:59.559 --> 05:01.108
with an organization that might be able

05:01.110 --> 05:03.108
to help us raise funds and awareness

05:03.110 --> 05:05.708
and your father said you
were the lawyer to come to.

05:05.710 --> 05:08.828
Well I'm not sure how
he would even know that.

05:08.830 --> 05:10.638
Well he spoke pretty highly of you.

05:10.640 --> 05:11.958
My suggestion, John,

05:11.960 --> 05:15.218
is that we set this up as a for-profit.

05:15.220 --> 05:16.208
I mean you're doing all the work.

05:16.210 --> 05:17.348
There's no reason why
you shouldn't be getting

05:17.350 --> 05:19.258
a piece of the action.

05:19.260 --> 05:20.888
And you can still help the troops

05:20.890 --> 05:23.343
and feel good on the inside
about all that stuff.

05:26.320 --> 05:28.143
- Mr. Meyers.
- Please, Jake.

05:29.360 --> 05:34.063
Jake, this isn't a business
as much as it's a mission.

05:36.050 --> 05:37.858
You ever had a family member or a friend

05:37.860 --> 05:39.210
killed in the line of duty?

05:40.438 --> 05:43.253
I have not.

05:44.309 --> 05:46.258
Yeah, that's a phone call

05:46.260 --> 05:47.878
you can never prepare yourself for.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.068
I can imagine.

05:49.070 --> 05:50.270
War is a terrible thing.

05:51.900 --> 05:55.418
The war isn't over for the
ones who get to come home.

05:55.420 --> 05:59.263
And for many of our veterans,
it's just beginning.

06:00.250 --> 06:01.798
Your father's done some great things

06:01.800 --> 06:02.688
for the men and women.

06:02.690 --> 06:05.098
Look John, invoking
the name of HB Meyers

06:05.100 --> 06:07.350
is not gonna get you
anywhere in this office.

06:11.680 --> 06:14.203
I'm sure I can find a lawyer
here who can assist you.

06:27.100 --> 06:27.931
Well thanks for your time.

06:27.933 --> 06:28.766
Yeah.

06:32.730 --> 06:35.088
Get someone to set him up with a 501-C.

06:35.090 --> 06:37.588
And the next time Herb
sends somebody over,

06:37.590 --> 06:40.218
just I don't know.

06:40.220 --> 06:41.451
Give 'em to Steve.

06:41.453 --> 06:45.734
Okay.

08:10.690 --> 08:11.693
You woke me up.

08:12.730 --> 08:14.903
Jake.

08:17.950 --> 08:20.383
Herb, it's 11 o'clock at night.

08:21.340 --> 08:22.538
It's kinda late for you, isn't it?

08:22.540 --> 08:25.513
Yeah, well the
meds make it tough to sleep.

08:29.360 --> 08:30.648
I saw you on "The Allen Show."

08:30.650 --> 08:31.708
Oh, yeah?

08:31.710 --> 08:32.967
You saw that?

08:32.970 --> 08:34.967
It was just on in the background.

08:34.970 --> 08:36.265
You looked terrible, by the way.

08:36.268 --> 08:38.518
Oh,
well thank you very much.

08:38.520 --> 08:42.063
The makeup girl did the
best she could, I think.

08:44.540 --> 08:45.697
What do you want?

08:45.699 --> 08:47.228
Well one thing,

08:47.230 --> 08:50.110
I sent you a copy of the latest book.

08:50.112 --> 08:51.378
Did you get it?

08:51.380 --> 08:52.211
Yeah.

08:52.213 --> 08:53.410
- Yeah, it's here.
- Good.

08:55.120 --> 08:56.758
Look, I'm really proud of it.

08:56.760 --> 08:57.798
This one, especially.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.798
And I just wanted you
when you get a chance,

09:00.800 --> 09:01.950
I think it's important.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.538
Hey, I met your buddy, John,
about the coffee charity.

09:05.540 --> 09:08.848
Oh, well I really
appreciate you helpin' out.

09:08.850 --> 09:10.708
I pointed him in the right direction.

09:10.710 --> 09:13.698
Herb, I don't have time for
all your hippy-dippy buddies

09:13.700 --> 09:14.531
and their causes.

09:14.533 --> 09:16.179
I'm tryin' to make a living.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.012
Okay.

09:17.014 --> 09:18.578
A really good living actually.

09:18.580 --> 09:22.156
I mean you should understand that, right?

09:22.158 --> 09:24.353
Tryin' to make money, live the good life.

09:25.471 --> 09:26.438
All right, all right.

09:26.440 --> 09:27.763
I know you're a busy man.

09:29.420 --> 09:31.068
Is this a happy birthday call or what?

09:31.070 --> 09:33.020
What, I didn't miss it, did I?

09:33.950 --> 09:35.251
Not this one.

09:35.253 --> 09:36.588
Okay good, good.

09:36.590 --> 09:38.413
I thought it was in a couple days.

09:39.620 --> 09:40.453
Tomorrow.

09:41.678 --> 09:42.509
Oh good.

09:42.511 --> 09:44.308
Well I'm bad with dates, Jake.

09:44.310 --> 09:45.753
I'm sorry, that's all.

09:48.650 --> 09:52.058
Look, the reason I'm calling

09:52.060 --> 09:54.708
I wanted to see if it
might be possible for you

09:54.710 --> 09:56.658
to make a trip up here to see me.

09:56.660 --> 09:58.758
- Listen, I really...
- Now before you tell me

09:58.760 --> 10:02.953
that you're too busy, there's
very good reason for it.

10:04.211 --> 10:06.088
I wasn't actually gonna say that.

10:06.090 --> 10:10.058
I was gonna sing you the chorus
from "Cats in the Cradle."

10:10.060 --> 10:13.418
Jake, look the oncologist said

10:13.420 --> 10:15.080
that I have a couple months

10:16.840 --> 10:17.777
at best.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.030
That's not long.

10:34.293 --> 10:37.078
No, not long at all.

10:37.080 --> 10:38.655
It's really that bad.

10:38.657 --> 10:43.403
Yeah, it is and it's
not gonna get any better.

10:44.956 --> 10:47.108
And I wanted to see you

10:47.110 --> 10:52.110
because I know we didn't
have much of a relationship.

10:54.060 --> 10:55.698
I don't blame me for that.

10:55.700 --> 10:57.150
I know that's not your fault.

10:59.747 --> 11:02.887
I just want you to know

11:04.110 --> 11:07.358
that not a day goes by that I don't regret

11:07.360 --> 11:10.523
all those moments that I
missed being your father.

11:14.140 --> 11:16.768
I guess dad has a way of making you

11:16.770 --> 11:18.603
reflect on your mistakes.

11:25.030 --> 11:26.080
I just wanna see you.

11:29.692 --> 11:30.957
Fine.

11:30.959 --> 11:32.042
One question:

11:35.288 --> 11:37.695
if you could go back

11:37.697 --> 11:40.903
the late nights, the trips outta town,

11:43.254 --> 11:44.278
the missed baseball games,

11:44.280 --> 11:48.553
the months away writing your books.

11:55.450 --> 11:57.997
You didn't even come to my graduation.

11:57.999 --> 11:59.328
Jake.

11:59.330 --> 12:04.093
If you could go back and
reflect on your mistakes,

12:06.449 --> 12:07.799
would you trade all of that

12:11.490 --> 12:12.360
not to be

12:13.880 --> 12:17.127
HB Myers: esteemed author?

12:23.070 --> 12:23.903
Just be here.

12:26.970 --> 12:29.093
Just be my dad.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.472
Forgiveness is
a powerful thing, Jake.

12:33.474 --> 12:35.988
You are so unbelievable.

12:35.990 --> 12:37.778
You can't even answer that, can you?

12:37.780 --> 12:38.719
Don't.

12:38.721 --> 12:41.128
You know, once again
this call isn't about me.

12:41.130 --> 12:42.083
It's about you.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.618
You're feeling guilty,
you're sittin' at home alone

12:45.620 --> 12:46.808
and you're tryin' to manipulate me

12:46.810 --> 12:50.598
into forgiving you for my
horrible childhood again,

12:50.600 --> 12:52.201
for never bein' there.

12:52.203 --> 12:53.688
I just wanna
try to make things right

12:53.690 --> 12:55.428
- before it's too late.
- The past is the past.

12:55.430 --> 12:56.730
Let's leave it there, huh?

12:59.416 --> 13:01.078
I can't.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.728
Well I can't argue with you.

13:02.730 --> 13:03.817
No, you can't

13:06.000 --> 13:07.550
'cause I learned from the best.

13:09.428 --> 13:10.555
Jake.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.958
Jake, Mr. Patterson has already called

13:20.960 --> 13:22.734
five times this morning.

13:22.736 --> 13:24.218
- Hi, good morning.
- It's not even nine a.m.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.418
It's actually quarter to 10, boss.

13:26.420 --> 13:27.251
That makes sense.

13:27.253 --> 13:28.084
What does he need?

13:28.086 --> 13:29.848
He wants to know when
his case is going to trial.

13:29.850 --> 13:31.428
But Jenny, am I bad at my job?

13:31.430 --> 13:32.261
Don't answer that.

13:32.263 --> 13:33.094
I'm incredibly good at my job

13:33.096 --> 13:34.988
and I told him a hundred times
when we were going to trial.

13:34.990 --> 13:36.052
You tell him.

13:36.054 --> 13:36.885
- I will tell him, yes.
- When the judge

13:36.887 --> 13:37.728
gives us a court date,

13:37.730 --> 13:38.631
- that's when we go to trial.
- Mm-hmm.

13:38.633 --> 13:39.464
All right, perfect.

13:39.466 --> 13:40.297
Thank you.

13:40.299 --> 13:41.388
- I should call him.
- You should call him.

13:41.390 --> 13:42.221
- I should call him.
- Go ahead, yeah.

13:42.223 --> 13:43.169
Hey, but what if I text him?

13:43.171 --> 13:44.377
- Is texting okay?
- Text him.

13:44.379 --> 13:45.210
Yeah, text him; it's easier.

13:45.212 --> 13:46.218
- Or you email him.
- I'll email him.

13:46.220 --> 13:47.051
- You write an email.
- Yes.

13:47.053 --> 13:48.278
What I would say how you would say it

13:48.280 --> 13:49.628
- comes out nicer that way.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

13:49.630 --> 13:50.768
- There you go.
- My cup of coffee?

13:50.770 --> 13:52.088
Yes, already on your desk.

13:52.090 --> 13:55.338
Also your RSVP list for your
birthday is in the inbox

13:55.340 --> 13:57.068
and the new recruits are currently

13:57.070 --> 13:58.818
stewing in the conference room.

13:58.820 --> 13:59.651
Perfect.

13:59.653 --> 14:00.738
Let the marinate.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.735
- All right.
- You're the best, Jenny.

14:04.900 --> 14:06.548
Listen up.

14:06.550 --> 14:11.550
If your life game plan includes
cars, boats, properties,

14:12.610 --> 14:14.160
you know what the difference is

14:16.000 --> 14:17.863
between you and me?

14:21.470 --> 14:22.570
You want those things.

14:26.090 --> 14:29.088
I have those things.

14:29.090 --> 14:30.858
You don't get success, you take success.

14:30.860 --> 14:31.910
Does that make sense?

14:33.140 --> 14:36.258
You gotta want it, crave it.

14:36.260 --> 14:38.898
Wake up in the morning
and pour it on your cereal

14:38.900 --> 14:41.168
before you start your day.

14:41.170 --> 14:42.220
Your client

14:43.060 --> 14:45.938
is 89 years old and on her deathbed.

14:45.940 --> 14:50.293
She lived a good life, a
long life, a rich life.

14:51.610 --> 14:54.898
I say forget her life, drain her dry.

14:54.900 --> 14:57.953
And when she's gone,
you go after her trust!

14:58.900 --> 15:00.123
You take everything.

15:01.840 --> 15:03.538
Does that make you feel bad?

15:03.540 --> 15:04.523
- No.
- Good.

15:06.120 --> 15:06.983
This guy gets it.

15:10.330 --> 15:11.163
How 'bout you?

15:15.360 --> 15:16.803
That bothers you, doesn't it?

15:20.861 --> 15:22.158
It's okay.

15:22.160 --> 15:23.053
You can tell me.

15:25.706 --> 15:26.706
I'm sorry.

15:27.630 --> 15:28.928
Well I appreciate that.

15:28.930 --> 15:30.398
What's your name?

15:30.400 --> 15:31.231
Nicolas.

15:31.233 --> 15:32.248
Nicolas, Nicolas.

15:32.250 --> 15:34.153
That's a good name, Nicolas.

15:35.780 --> 15:37.843
I appreciate your honesty, Nicolas.

15:38.960 --> 15:41.568
And I advise you to go
work for some nonprofit.

15:41.570 --> 15:44.618
I don't think you'll be
very happy here, Nicolas.

15:44.620 --> 15:48.348
Because we are not a 501-C!

15:48.350 --> 15:51.578
We are here for one reason!

15:51.580 --> 15:54.108
Do you know what that reason is, Nicholas?

15:54.110 --> 15:55.608
I'm givin' you another shot here, kid.

15:55.610 --> 15:56.893
Don't mess it up.

15:58.570 --> 15:59.428
Our clients?

15:59.430 --> 16:00.890
You messed it up.

16:06.000 --> 16:06.833
Money.

16:09.110 --> 16:11.123
We are here for money.

16:14.560 --> 16:15.638
He's a sucker.

16:15.640 --> 16:16.638
I give him two days tops.

16:16.640 --> 16:18.973
If he makes it to three,
I buy everybody dinner.

16:19.839 --> 16:21.658
If you're afraid of
crossing some ethical oath

16:21.660 --> 16:22.933
you took in law school,

16:23.980 --> 16:25.385
you go all the way up to that line

16:25.387 --> 16:28.073
and you bend it until it almost breaks.

16:29.743 --> 16:31.168
Are you afraid of doing something illegal?

16:31.170 --> 16:32.543
You are a warrior.

16:34.530 --> 16:36.862
Figure out a way to make it legal.

16:49.520 --> 16:50.353
Yeah.

16:52.060 --> 16:52.893
Hey.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.343
This a bad time, Jake?

16:56.220 --> 16:58.278
Never a bad time for you two.

16:58.280 --> 17:01.428
Heard your Glen Gary speech
went over well yesterday.

17:01.430 --> 17:02.261
Yeah, yeah.

17:02.263 --> 17:03.094
It's subjective.

17:03.096 --> 17:05.017
I only had one leave in tears this time.

17:05.019 --> 17:08.401
We wanted to
have a little talk with you.

17:08.403 --> 17:09.948
You know, Charlie and I were thinking.

17:09.950 --> 17:11.997
This about the incident again?

17:11.999 --> 17:13.919
- Not really.
- Yeah.

17:13.921 --> 17:15.202
Yeah, it is.

17:15.204 --> 17:16.246
Yeah.

17:16.248 --> 17:17.079
Jake?

17:17.082 --> 17:17.915
Oh.

17:19.249 --> 17:20.080
I'm sorry,

17:20.083 --> 17:22.598
this captivating conversation's
gonna have to wait.

17:22.599 --> 17:24.849
That's Jenny letting me
know my 11:30's here.

17:26.892 --> 17:28.638
- He's early.
- This is important, Jake.

17:28.640 --> 17:29.878
- So maybe we could...
- You guys are comin'

17:29.880 --> 17:31.757
to my party tonight, right?

17:31.759 --> 17:32.591
- Yeah.
- Great.

17:32.593 --> 17:33.830
Let's pick up this talk then.

17:35.900 --> 17:37.608
- Yeah.
- Okay.

17:37.610 --> 17:39.640
- See you tonight.
- Yeah.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.168
Happy birthday, partner.

17:41.170 --> 17:42.003
Yeah.

18:05.886 --> 18:07.091
in hospital.

18:07.093 --> 18:09.010
Talk to you guys later.

18:11.299 --> 18:12.130
- Sounds fun.
- Jake,

18:12.132 --> 18:12.963
can I talk to you for a minute?

18:12.965 --> 18:14.698
Hey, do you wanna meet my friends?

18:14.700 --> 18:17.723
Hey, you don't go anywhere
without sayin' goodnight, okay?

18:19.610 --> 18:20.798
Come here.

18:20.800 --> 18:24.518
I did not mean to break up your
Mensa convention over there.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.488
You're being funny.

18:25.490 --> 18:27.548
Okay, well they are your type.

18:27.550 --> 18:28.993
- Hot.
- Shallow.

18:30.269 --> 18:31.488
I am insulted.

18:31.490 --> 18:32.448
Really?

18:32.450 --> 18:33.533
No, not at all.

18:34.900 --> 18:37.178
So what'd you wanna talk about anyway?

18:37.180 --> 18:38.078
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

18:38.080 --> 18:38.911
I was gonna tell you

18:38.913 --> 18:40.947
that your partners have
been looking for you.

18:40.949 --> 18:42.075
- Yeah, I found 'em.
- That's okay.

18:42.077 --> 18:42.908
- I am sorry 'bout that.
- That's okay.

18:42.910 --> 18:43.866
- I'll grab a napkin.
- Thanks, Jenny.

18:43.868 --> 18:44.699
- Yeah?
- I appreciate that.

18:44.701 --> 18:45.738
Maybe grab Charlie another drink.

18:45.740 --> 18:46.571
- No no no.
- No, that's okay.

18:46.573 --> 18:47.404
No, grab him one.

18:47.406 --> 18:48.781
- Grab him one.
- Okay.

18:50.680 --> 18:54.498
So if I recall correctly,
you two wanted to a talk.

18:54.500 --> 18:55.903
Yeah, yeah.

18:57.110 --> 18:59.248
So the partners have been talking.

18:59.250 --> 19:01.298
Of which I am also one.

19:01.300 --> 19:02.488
Right, of course.

19:02.490 --> 19:03.588
Of course.

19:03.590 --> 19:06.338
We, the other partners, have been talking.

19:06.340 --> 19:09.263
You're always mentioning
about going on vacation, right?

19:10.510 --> 19:14.450
We think it would be a good
idea for you to look into that.

19:16.577 --> 19:17.548
Are you guys forcin'
me to take a vacation?

19:17.550 --> 19:18.381
No no no.

19:18.383 --> 19:21.183
- We're not forcin'.
- Not forcing, inviting.

19:23.240 --> 19:24.073
C'mon.

19:25.460 --> 19:27.508
I know I made a mistake,
but I've done well.

19:27.510 --> 19:30.588
You physically assaulted
the defendant's counsel.

19:30.590 --> 19:32.118
Let's chalk it up to a bad day.

19:32.120 --> 19:33.508
I mean we all have bad days.

19:33.510 --> 19:35.660
Yeah, some of us more
public than others.

19:37.340 --> 19:38.171
C'mon, Jake.

19:38.173 --> 19:39.263
Okay, okay, okay.

19:40.514 --> 19:41.347
Okay.

19:42.500 --> 19:43.333
I admit.

19:45.300 --> 19:48.420
I admit I was under a lot of stress

19:49.540 --> 19:52.153
both personal and at the office.

19:53.940 --> 19:55.240
Jake, it's the drinking.

19:57.590 --> 19:59.838
It's my birthday party.

19:59.840 --> 20:00.673
At work.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.570
I see what's goin' on here.

20:06.860 --> 20:08.418
You guys are teamin' up on me.

20:08.420 --> 20:09.400
No, we're not teaming up on you.

20:09.402 --> 20:10.538
- Yeah, you are.
- Ready to move on.

20:10.540 --> 20:11.903
From the incident or me?

20:13.400 --> 20:14.233
It's both.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.008
Well if you're tryin'
to fire me, Charlie,

20:18.010 --> 20:18.928
- just come out and say it.
- Look, Jake.

20:18.930 --> 20:19.908
We're not tryin' to fire you.

20:19.910 --> 20:20.741
Yeah, you are.

20:20.743 --> 20:21.574
- No, we're not.
- Yeah, ya are.

20:21.576 --> 20:22.838
Jake, listen, listen, listen.

20:22.840 --> 20:24.370
We've got an NDA right here.

20:24.372 --> 20:26.493
We want you to sign it
and say that you resigned.

20:27.380 --> 20:28.658
That's it.

20:28.660 --> 20:30.910
You get a very large check

20:31.942 --> 20:34.908
and we get to start fresh.

20:34.910 --> 20:36.530
You brought an NDA

20:38.830 --> 20:39.880
to my birthday party?

20:42.042 --> 20:43.125
Unbelievable.

20:44.290 --> 20:45.258
Get out.

20:45.260 --> 20:46.828
Could you just do us a favor?

20:46.830 --> 20:49.031
- Do you a favor?
- Yeah, do us a favor.

20:49.033 --> 20:50.364
Do you a favor?

20:50.366 --> 20:51.322
I've been doin' you a favor
since we start this firm.

20:51.324 --> 20:52.538
Jake, back off for a change.

20:52.540 --> 20:54.385
I'm the only partner
who has a spine, man.

20:54.387 --> 20:56.052
Back off, man.

20:56.054 --> 20:56.885
Back off.

20:56.887 --> 20:58.097
- All right, that's it.
- That's what I thought.

20:58.099 --> 20:59.167
- That's it.
- Yeah, no spine.

20:59.169 --> 21:00.038
Charlie, forget it.

21:00.040 --> 21:02.177
Forget it, he's drunk.

21:08.374 --> 21:10.685
- I
- have the 502 in progress.

21:10.687 --> 21:13.808
35-0 back in A1.

21:13.810 --> 21:16.170
Did you have a rough night?

21:16.172 --> 21:17.658
Clearly, no.

21:17.660 --> 21:18.688
Spent the night in jail.

21:18.690 --> 21:20.188
I appreciate you taking your time

21:20.190 --> 21:21.021
bailing me out, by the way.

21:21.023 --> 21:22.568
- I needed that self-reflection.
- Okay.

21:22.570 --> 21:23.428
Well excuse you.

21:23.430 --> 21:25.248
Someone had to stay at your party.

21:25.250 --> 21:27.828
Someone had to clean up, pay the deejay,

21:27.830 --> 21:29.215
be responsible, Jake.

21:29.217 --> 21:30.878
Jenny, come on.

21:30.880 --> 21:31.908
You saw what happened.

21:31.910 --> 21:33.173
It's not my fault.

21:34.930 --> 21:35.761
Okay fine, fine.

21:35.763 --> 21:37.358
Maybe I didn't help the situation.

21:37.360 --> 21:38.412
You did not help the situation.

21:38.414 --> 21:39.498
It was partially my fault.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.698
Entirely your fault, actually.

21:41.700 --> 21:43.818
It was totally understandable.

21:43.820 --> 21:48.168
Okay, this is me taking
off my employee hat

21:48.170 --> 21:49.919
and putting on my friend hat.

21:49.921 --> 21:51.188
Oh, thanks.

21:51.190 --> 21:53.278
Your life is a mess

21:53.280 --> 21:55.498
and you don't even seem to care, Jake.

21:55.500 --> 21:56.748
Thanks, mom.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.558
Okay, do not be a jerk to me.

21:58.560 --> 22:00.060
I just bailed you out of jail.

22:02.890 --> 22:04.018
It's under control.

22:04.020 --> 22:04.853
What is?

22:06.130 --> 22:07.108
You know.

22:07.110 --> 22:07.941
I don't.

22:07.943 --> 22:08.988
Please enlighten me.

22:08.990 --> 22:10.618
What do you have under control?

22:10.620 --> 22:12.228
It's under control.

22:12.230 --> 22:14.648
Okay, well obviously this
isn't going to help your case

22:14.650 --> 22:15.548
with the partners.

22:15.550 --> 22:16.818
But they're never gonna know.

22:16.820 --> 22:18.144
You think you can hide it from them?

22:18.146 --> 22:18.977
Are you gonna tell 'em?

22:18.979 --> 22:20.606
It's in public record, you know?

22:20.608 --> 22:22.015
Look who you're talking to.

22:22.017 --> 22:24.189
I know how to get around
the system, Jenny.

22:24.191 --> 22:26.178
If you gimme a few days,

22:26.180 --> 22:27.288
it's gonna be a slap on the wrist,

22:27.290 --> 22:28.918
a few hours of community service at worst.

22:28.920 --> 22:31.588
It's nothing I haven't
had to deal with before.

22:31.590 --> 22:35.308
Well do you want me to
cancel your meetings today?

22:35.310 --> 22:36.168
Push everything a week.

22:36.170 --> 22:39.493
Okay, maybe you should take
that vacation, relax a little.

22:42.180 --> 22:43.168
Okay.

22:43.170 --> 22:44.088
- Okay.
- Yeah.

22:44.090 --> 22:44.921
Yeah.

22:44.923 --> 22:45.754
Tell them I'm gonna take a week off.

22:45.756 --> 22:48.018
But make it clear I am not resigning

22:48.020 --> 22:49.168
and it's of my own volition.

22:49.170 --> 22:50.573
Mm-hmm, you got it.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.560
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

22:53.562 --> 22:54.528
Lemme know what they say.

22:54.530 --> 22:59.168
As your HR representative,
I am here as your advocate.

22:59.170 --> 23:01.348
The purpose of this meeting
is to find a solution

23:01.350 --> 23:04.113
that is beneficial to
both you and the company.

23:10.790 --> 23:11.888
I made it pretty clear before:

23:11.890 --> 23:14.118
If I see this again, I'll sue.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.620
Not just the firm, each
one of you as individuals.

23:19.160 --> 23:21.018
And you know you don't wanna
be sitting at that table

23:21.020 --> 23:22.270
across the aisle from me.

23:23.440 --> 23:25.598
Jake, let's just be reasonable.

23:25.600 --> 23:28.498
If this is a negotiation tactic.

23:28.500 --> 23:29.758
Did you see the sum at the bottom?

23:29.760 --> 23:31.428
It's a lotta money.

23:31.430 --> 23:33.568
It's not about the money.

23:33.570 --> 23:36.198
Never thought I'd hear those
words come out of your mouth.

23:36.200 --> 23:37.333
C'mon, Harry.

23:38.720 --> 23:40.928
This firm would've closed
up shop a long time ago

23:40.930 --> 23:41.761
if it wasn't for me.

23:41.763 --> 23:43.307
Respect is a two-way street, Jake.

23:43.309 --> 23:44.685
I don't respect you, Charlie.

23:44.687 --> 23:45.998
'Least I'm not an embarrassment.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.798
Gentlemen, please.

23:47.800 --> 23:50.308
Jake, according to the company's bylaws,

23:50.310 --> 23:53.108
the firm has the right to ask you to take

23:53.110 --> 23:56.618
a two-week leave of absence
effective: starting today.

23:56.620 --> 23:57.490
Jenny already told you

23:57.492 --> 23:59.088
I said I was takin' some
time off for my own.

23:59.090 --> 24:01.298
And we wanted to make sure that you knew

24:01.300 --> 24:05.300
that this time off is
mandated by the firm.

24:05.302 --> 24:06.133
Is that what this is about?

24:06.135 --> 24:08.151
Is that why we're here, some time off?

24:08.153 --> 24:09.568
'Kay, I'll tell you what, Harry.

24:09.570 --> 24:10.401
I'll shoot straight with you.

24:10.403 --> 24:11.428
You've always shot straight with me

24:11.430 --> 24:13.678
and I like you more than I like him.

24:13.680 --> 24:16.848
I'll take your time off, okay?

24:16.850 --> 24:20.048
I will take your two weeks
affective immediately.

24:20.050 --> 24:21.478
Are we happy now?

24:21.480 --> 24:22.938
Does that please the court?

24:22.940 --> 24:23.918
Can I go home?

24:23.920 --> 24:25.598
Are we done here?

24:25.600 --> 24:29.413
We wanted you to take
this time to really think,

24:30.770 --> 24:33.498
think about your recent issues

24:33.500 --> 24:36.088
and the idea that we have done our best

24:36.090 --> 24:40.318
to keep all of these
recent incidents in-house,

24:40.320 --> 24:42.348
away from the press

24:42.350 --> 24:45.118
and away from our
colleagues at other firms.

24:45.120 --> 24:48.403
I mean come on, you know
how it is in our circles.

24:49.260 --> 24:50.663
News travels fast,

24:51.930 --> 24:54.478
bad news travels faster.

24:54.480 --> 24:58.248
So we could keep going round and round

24:58.250 --> 25:01.578
or you could help yourself.

25:01.580 --> 25:04.290
And yes, help the firm

25:05.700 --> 25:06.533
and sign it.

25:08.380 --> 25:10.480
I gotta say I'm proud of you, Harry.

25:11.560 --> 25:12.613
The birth of a spine.

25:14.140 --> 25:16.528
I spent eight years of schooling,

25:16.530 --> 25:18.668
forfeiting any kinda social life

25:18.670 --> 25:20.588
to graduate the top of
my class at Harvard.

25:20.590 --> 25:23.243
When we started this
firm, we had two clients.

25:24.410 --> 25:25.243
Remember that?

25:26.720 --> 25:28.548
Look where we are now.

25:28.550 --> 25:30.788
In the last several years, I
have successfully delivered

25:30.790 --> 25:33.038
over 100 million dollars
worth of settlements.

25:33.040 --> 25:35.138
The National Law Journal recognized me

25:35.140 --> 25:37.658
as the Lawyer of the Year, twice.

25:37.660 --> 25:39.248
The American Bar Association

25:39.250 --> 25:42.068
awarded me the John H.
Pickering Achievement Award.

25:42.070 --> 25:44.048
Super Lawyers continually ranks me

25:44.050 --> 25:45.748
in the top three in the
State of California.

25:45.750 --> 25:47.268
How many times have you
been in the top three

25:47.270 --> 25:48.918
in the State of California and what?

25:48.920 --> 25:53.623
You want me to sign on this
line and I'm not gonna do it.

25:54.660 --> 25:57.718
And you should be thanking
me because without me,

25:57.720 --> 26:00.198
this firm is nothing.

26:00.200 --> 26:03.263
Without me, you are nothing.

26:04.430 --> 26:05.261
Do you really think

26:05.263 --> 26:07.428
I'm gonna let all of my achievements die

26:07.430 --> 26:10.078
because you decided grow a spine?

26:10.080 --> 26:11.280
I think we're done here.

26:13.379 --> 26:14.629
And I tell you what guys.

26:16.200 --> 26:19.680
If you leak anything, I'll add
defamation to the suit, kay?

26:21.960 --> 26:23.238
See you in two weeks.

26:23.240 --> 26:28.240
Oh and Sherry, I'll probably
sue you too, just a heads-up.

26:35.140 --> 26:36.045
Okay you can work, Jake.

26:36.047 --> 26:38.098
But not too much or too hard, okay?

26:38.100 --> 26:39.633
This is your vacation.

26:41.010 --> 26:42.708
Vacation is a flawed concept, Jenny.

26:42.710 --> 26:44.228
It fosters complacency.

26:44.230 --> 26:46.878
That's why nobody's been
to the moon in 50 years.

26:46.880 --> 26:49.158
I, on the other hand,
will be working tirelessly

26:49.160 --> 26:50.578
over the course of the next two weeks

26:50.580 --> 26:53.608
to show Harry and Charlie
what they would be missing

26:53.610 --> 26:54.578
if I did in fact leave.

26:54.580 --> 26:56.018
Okay that was the wrong answer, Jake.

26:56.020 --> 26:57.868
You need to take a breather.

26:57.870 --> 27:00.438
You need to relax, trust me.

27:00.440 --> 27:01.390
Sure thing, boss.

27:03.390 --> 27:05.058
What is this?

27:05.060 --> 27:06.698
Is this from your dad?

27:06.700 --> 27:07.758
Yup.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.748
Are you going to open it?

27:09.750 --> 27:10.583
Nope.

27:11.480 --> 27:13.758
Well aren't you a little
bit curious what's inside?

27:13.760 --> 27:14.591
It's a book.

27:14.593 --> 27:15.518
He sends me all of 'em.

27:15.520 --> 27:16.998
Are any of them good?

27:17.000 --> 27:19.408
I've actually never read them.

27:19.410 --> 27:20.638
Really?

27:20.640 --> 27:21.540
Never wanted to.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.858
Certainly doesn't stop him
from continuing to send them.

27:24.860 --> 27:26.958
However, it's about the only
thing that he does send me.

27:26.960 --> 27:27.968
There's a whole pile in the garage

27:27.970 --> 27:29.368
if you wanna take some home.

27:29.370 --> 27:30.968
Okay.

27:30.970 --> 27:32.718
Ooh, "The Man From Nowhere."

27:32.720 --> 27:34.650
It's all yours.

27:34.652 --> 27:37.078
Look, the guy on the
cover kinda looks like you.

27:37.080 --> 27:37.928
You need a book.

27:37.930 --> 27:38.761
You're on vacation.

27:38.763 --> 27:39.708
You have the time.

27:39.710 --> 27:41.028
You need to relax.

27:41.030 --> 27:43.348
You know perfectly well
there's nothing about my father

27:43.350 --> 27:44.498
that will make me relax.

27:44.500 --> 27:45.728
Okay, well fine.

27:45.730 --> 27:47.128
I will be at the office,

27:47.130 --> 27:48.848
so holler at me if you need anything.

27:48.850 --> 27:51.006
But you won't need anything
because you will not be working.

27:51.008 --> 27:52.608
Actually, I do need something.

27:52.610 --> 27:53.958
Those girls from the party.

27:53.960 --> 27:55.168
- Sorry.
- I gave them office number.

27:55.170 --> 27:56.001
- Okay, no.
- So if they call...

27:56.003 --> 27:57.368
So we're throwing those numbers away.

27:57.370 --> 27:58.448
No, why?

27:58.450 --> 27:59.281
Be nice.

27:59.283 --> 28:00.114
- Just give 'em my cell.
- Okay,

28:00.116 --> 28:00.947
- I'll handle it for you.
- Give 'em my Snapchat.

28:00.949 --> 28:02.008
I don't care.

28:02.010 --> 28:02.848
No, okay.

28:02.850 --> 28:04.428
Have a good day, Jake.

28:04.430 --> 28:05.263
Yes.

28:17.887 --> 28:19.778
"For Sergeant Frank Rogers

28:19.780 --> 28:21.337
and the men of Charlie Company."

28:22.385 --> 28:23.328
All right, Herb.

28:23.330 --> 28:25.047
I'll give you five pages.

28:28.395 --> 28:29.228
400.

28:30.281 --> 28:31.114
Bet.

28:34.816 --> 28:35.816
You callin'?

28:37.010 --> 28:38.238
Yeah, Arch.

28:38.240 --> 28:39.888
Sure.

28:39.890 --> 28:40.723
I'll call.

28:42.580 --> 28:44.058
Me too.

28:44.060 --> 28:45.060
No surprise there.

28:46.040 --> 28:48.083
And I suppose you'll follow suit.

28:53.231 --> 28:54.062
I raise.

28:54.064 --> 28:55.842
You raise?

28:55.844 --> 28:58.738
I
think you meant to say call.

28:58.740 --> 29:01.077
You do realize whose game you're at.

29:02.683 --> 29:05.238
Now we are playin'
poker, aren't we fellas?

29:05.240 --> 29:06.518
Well yeah.

29:06.520 --> 29:07.798
And within the rules of the game,

29:07.800 --> 29:10.753
I am allowed to raise or
am I thinkin' of Go Fish?

29:11.680 --> 29:13.613
Yeah, you don't raise at this table.

29:16.397 --> 29:19.138
I got no kick, Billy.

29:19.140 --> 29:20.308
This daisy just ain't familiar

29:20.310 --> 29:22.210
with whose table he's sittin' at.

29:26.160 --> 29:26.993
I fold.

29:27.890 --> 29:28.723
Me too.

29:31.420 --> 29:32.323
How many cards?

29:35.770 --> 29:36.804
One.

29:45.505 --> 29:47.618
I shoulda took more cards, huh?

29:53.660 --> 29:54.623
I raise.

29:56.068 --> 29:57.993
Can you believe this egghead, Tiny?

29:59.480 --> 30:00.937
You think you're smart,

30:01.943 --> 30:03.980
but you have no idea how I am

30:04.963 --> 30:06.595
or what I do to people
I don't like very much.

30:06.597 --> 30:08.528
I'm not interested in your life story,

30:08.530 --> 30:09.530
just your next move.

30:13.010 --> 30:13.843
Call.

30:16.111 --> 30:16.944
Two pair.

30:21.060 --> 30:22.153
Three nines.

30:23.830 --> 30:25.430
Quite the card player, mister.

30:26.480 --> 30:28.418
I ain't here for the cards.

30:28.420 --> 30:31.973
Good 'cause this money ain't
goin' home with no grifter.

30:33.670 --> 30:35.728
I know you boys are upset.

30:35.730 --> 30:36.948
I can't say as I blame you

30:36.950 --> 30:39.995
because you're rotten
card players, all of ya.

30:39.997 --> 30:41.618
Now by my estimation,

30:41.620 --> 30:44.188
I think you guys are gonna
reach for those bean shooters

30:44.190 --> 30:45.021
in your pockets.

30:45.023 --> 30:47.230
But before you do, you
better know who I am

30:48.623 --> 30:51.027
and you ain't gonna like my answer.

30:51.029 --> 30:52.196
Who are you?

30:53.640 --> 30:54.548
That's a valid question

30:54.550 --> 30:57.618
even though I had to prompt you, Joseph.

30:57.620 --> 30:58.518
I'm glad you asked.

30:58.520 --> 30:59.608
If you're smarter than you look,

30:59.610 --> 31:00.758
I don't care what Ike says about you.

31:00.760 --> 31:05.098
Who are you?

31:05.100 --> 31:05.933
Gamble.

31:06.990 --> 31:07.843
Johnny Gamble.

31:09.292 --> 31:12.703
You're the Johnny Gamble, the detective?

31:13.717 --> 31:15.463
I thought I smelled a rat.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.650
I told you you were
gonna like my answer.

31:19.940 --> 31:22.490
Nicked money from
every crook he took down,

31:24.073 --> 31:26.423
even took money from his
own police department.

31:28.270 --> 31:29.873
Nothin' worse than a Judas.

31:31.110 --> 31:32.460
That's a fair assessment.

31:33.968 --> 31:36.623
I recognized my transgression,
then I went straight.

31:38.040 --> 31:39.367
Even I wasn't past savin'.

31:40.342 --> 31:42.458
Hear that, boys?

31:42.460 --> 31:44.526
Crooked copper found religion.

31:47.520 --> 31:49.570
How do we know you ain't lyin', Gamble?

31:50.506 --> 31:52.756
Well why don't we find
out together, Billy?

31:54.590 --> 31:56.908
I know you're
not here for the chitchat

31:56.910 --> 31:57.960
or the money, Gamble.

31:59.230 --> 32:00.708
So what do you want?

32:00.710 --> 32:01.862
Information.

32:01.864 --> 32:03.643
We ain't no canaries.

32:07.220 --> 32:09.548
I'm lookin' for my son.

32:09.550 --> 32:10.400
Your boy?

32:11.760 --> 32:13.910
Your boy don't wanna see you.

32:15.013 --> 32:18.923
Your boy don't wanna be nothin'
like you, you no-good yap.

32:21.367 --> 32:23.310
He only knows what I used to be.

32:25.199 --> 32:27.349
He's runnin'
with Herod's crew now.

32:28.500 --> 32:30.258
Yeah, now see that's
what I'm lookin' for.

32:30.260 --> 32:31.753
Now we're gettin' someplace.

32:32.820 --> 32:33.863
Where's Herod?

32:35.050 --> 32:38.508
Same place you've
been for the last five years:

32:38.510 --> 32:39.520
nowhere.

32:41.860 --> 32:43.498
Okay, I don't need you doing any work.

32:43.500 --> 32:46.668
But I do need some signatures
for the Patterson's file.

32:46.670 --> 32:51.178
So if you could just sign full
signature where it's in red

32:51.180 --> 32:52.923
and then initials in yellow.

32:56.980 --> 32:58.548
You started reading it?

32:58.550 --> 32:59.978
Yeah.

32:59.980 --> 33:01.008
I saw somewhere that your dad's

33:01.010 --> 33:02.533
going on a book tour or something.

33:03.420 --> 33:04.768
No chance.

33:04.770 --> 33:06.058
He told me he doesn't have much time left.

33:06.060 --> 33:07.028
He's pretty sick.

33:07.030 --> 33:08.238
You've talked to him?

33:08.240 --> 33:10.738
Yeah, I mean it was quick.

33:10.740 --> 33:13.788
It was like a "Happy birthday.

33:13.790 --> 33:14.868
Here's my latest book."

33:14.870 --> 33:16.298
That kinda thing.

33:16.300 --> 33:18.163
Okay, well at least you're
talking about something.

33:20.120 --> 33:21.520
He wants me to go see him.

33:22.590 --> 33:24.588
Well you are on vacation.

33:24.590 --> 33:26.568
You don't get it, Jenny.

33:26.570 --> 33:28.628
It's always about him.

33:28.630 --> 33:29.773
It's always an ask.

33:31.100 --> 33:32.323
Okay, well thank you.

33:33.840 --> 33:34.868
Yeah.

33:34.870 --> 33:35.770
Have a good day.

33:45.915 --> 33:50.082
I'm still working on the
doughnuts from earlier.

33:54.660 --> 33:55.493
Herb.

33:58.190 --> 33:59.828
What are you doin' here?

33:59.830 --> 34:01.278
Am I good to go now, Mr. Meyers?

34:01.280 --> 34:02.598
- Yes, you are.
- No.

34:02.600 --> 34:04.428
No, why are you here?

34:04.430 --> 34:06.580
See, I told you he
was gon' be like this.

34:08.152 --> 34:09.737
Did you break him outta the hospital?

34:09.739 --> 34:11.068
Well I did most of the work,

34:11.070 --> 34:12.556
but he was very well-compensated.

34:12.559 --> 34:13.391
Thank you, Aaron.

34:13.393 --> 34:14.224
Thank you, sir.

34:14.226 --> 34:15.056
You can go.

34:15.059 --> 34:15.889
Here's your bag.

34:15.891 --> 34:17.572
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

34:22.623 --> 34:23.632
Help me out here.

34:25.730 --> 34:27.786
Come on, let's go.

34:27.789 --> 34:28.739
It's cold out here.

34:43.300 --> 34:45.641
Do you want a drink?

34:45.643 --> 34:49.061
'Cause I'm gonna have like 50.

34:49.063 --> 34:50.898
I don't really drink anymore.

34:50.900 --> 34:53.108
It seemed a little bit
early for that really.

34:53.110 --> 34:53.940
That's right.

34:53.943 --> 34:57.358
I keep forgetting you're a
new man since you found God.

34:57.360 --> 34:59.158
Well maybe if I'm around long enough,

34:59.160 --> 35:00.391
I can prove that to ya.

35:00.393 --> 35:02.028
Is that a joke?

35:02.030 --> 35:02.863
Because

35:04.680 --> 35:06.557
I can't tell if you're tryin' to be funny

35:06.559 --> 35:07.543
or what right now.

35:09.380 --> 35:11.278
You seem a little grouchy.

35:11.280 --> 35:13.508
I think you might need a second.

35:13.510 --> 35:15.218
Why don't you just show me to my room

35:15.220 --> 35:16.933
and I'll get a little rest?

35:18.190 --> 35:20.448
Show you to your room.

35:20.450 --> 35:21.307
Yeah, yeah.

35:21.309 --> 35:22.458
- I won't...
- Wow.

35:22.460 --> 35:23.778
I sleep most of the time anyway.

35:23.780 --> 35:25.428
I won't bother you too much.

35:25.430 --> 35:27.528
I mean I can see how busy you are.

35:27.530 --> 35:28.468
All right, sounds good, Herb.

35:28.470 --> 35:30.094
Nap time.

35:53.010 --> 35:54.973
You awake yet, Johnny boy?

35:56.710 --> 35:58.468
You tellin' me this sap was the same guy

35:58.470 --> 36:01.078
that got the drop on
Benny's team in Chicago?

36:01.080 --> 36:02.808
Smoked all of his boys.

36:02.810 --> 36:04.198
This guy?

36:04.200 --> 36:06.078
Nah, Joe.

36:06.080 --> 36:07.383
That was a different guy.

36:08.460 --> 36:10.926
This is the new Johnny Gamble.

36:13.960 --> 36:15.123
I like my odds.

36:16.720 --> 36:19.358
Four-on-one, you dumb lug?

36:19.360 --> 36:21.360
You really live up to your name, Gamble.

36:22.250 --> 36:23.264
Five-on-one.

36:23.266 --> 36:25.099
That guy counts twice.

36:27.140 --> 36:29.228
I wanna put a pill square in the temple

36:29.230 --> 36:30.968
of this pallucco right now.

36:30.970 --> 36:33.418
Somebody told me why I don't do that.

36:33.420 --> 36:35.328
Send in word to Herod?

36:35.330 --> 36:37.563
You know he'll pay top draw for Gamble.

36:39.050 --> 36:41.048
You know he's gonna want him alive, Ike.

36:41.050 --> 36:42.100
Maybe a couple large?

36:43.160 --> 36:44.610
You tell Herod to get here.

36:45.830 --> 36:47.918
You tell him to bring my son.

36:47.920 --> 36:48.788
He's not comin' here,

36:48.790 --> 36:51.054
so you could play patty
cake with your son.

36:52.430 --> 36:55.903
He's comin' here to bump
you off, you no-good fake.

36:57.830 --> 37:00.168
It's the risk I'm willin' to take.

37:00.170 --> 37:02.690
You know what your problem is, Gamble?

37:02.692 --> 37:05.228
You think you're the one
teachin' the lessons,

37:05.230 --> 37:06.170
not gettin' 'em.

37:08.650 --> 37:10.648
Who's the eggs-and-butter
man around here, huh?

37:10.650 --> 37:11.481
You are, Ike.

37:11.483 --> 37:13.298
That's right I am.

37:13.300 --> 37:16.937
And here's the thing, I don't
wanna have Herod's money.

37:17.810 --> 37:19.073
I got enough cabbage.

37:20.810 --> 37:25.658
No, I got a better plan: a
lesson you'll never forget.

37:25.660 --> 37:26.960
What you thinkin', boss?

37:28.570 --> 37:30.570
Gonna deliver you to Herod, all right.

37:31.853 --> 37:35.638
And then I'm gonna shoot your
son right between the eyes

37:35.640 --> 37:37.003
and you're gonna watch.

37:39.100 --> 37:39.953
I'm the law.

37:41.193 --> 37:43.117
I can't do this.

37:43.119 --> 37:44.223
This guy's pathetic.

37:47.310 --> 37:48.143
You know what?

37:49.590 --> 37:53.118
Boys, go ahead and shoot Gamble.

37:53.120 --> 37:54.590
Herod'll be happy as a clam

37:55.510 --> 37:59.238
and I'll still ice his son for fun.

37:59.240 --> 38:00.088
You wanna kill me?

38:00.090 --> 38:01.305
Go ahead.

38:01.307 --> 38:02.388
What're ya waitin' for?

38:02.390 --> 38:03.223
Kill me.

38:04.670 --> 38:07.117
The minute you threaten
my son, I'm the law.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.200
Lesson learned.

38:40.351 --> 38:43.558
I want you to tell Herod
that I'm comin' for him.

38:43.560 --> 38:44.393
You hear me?

38:45.500 --> 38:47.350
You tell him Gamble's comin' for him.

38:58.770 --> 38:59.601
Are you doing okay?

38:59.603 --> 39:00.888
I could've just come by your house.

39:00.890 --> 39:01.928
No.

39:01.930 --> 39:02.908
- No.
- Why?

39:02.910 --> 39:03.741
You could not have

39:03.743 --> 39:07.298
because there is a self-proclaimed
reforming absentee father

39:07.300 --> 39:09.900
in a wheelchair currently
takin' up residency there.

39:11.710 --> 39:13.028
Yeah, I should've known
you put him up to this.

39:13.030 --> 39:13.888
- Okay, no.
- He would never have thought

39:13.890 --> 39:15.318
- to come see me by himself.
- All I did was reach out

39:15.320 --> 39:16.151
to his agent.

39:16.153 --> 39:18.878
He had to break outta
the hospital on his own.

39:18.880 --> 39:20.248
You're so fired.

39:20.250 --> 39:21.708
I think it's amazing.

39:21.710 --> 39:24.478
Yeah, only because you didn't
grow up with him as his son.

39:24.480 --> 39:27.378
Jenny, we're talkin' about a
guy whose fondest memory of me

39:27.380 --> 39:28.428
was sending me off to school

39:28.430 --> 39:29.868
on the other side of the country.

39:29.870 --> 39:30.948
So when you say it's amazing

39:30.950 --> 39:33.098
that he showed up
randomly on my front porch

39:33.100 --> 39:35.458
and wants to pretend like
everything has been fine

39:35.460 --> 39:38.958
for the last 30 years, I don't get that.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.438
I'm gonna give you some advice.

39:40.440 --> 39:41.768
Jake, he's gonna be gone

39:41.770 --> 39:44.888
and you're too busy being a selfish child

39:44.890 --> 39:46.243
to even listen to him.

39:48.450 --> 39:49.828
You've said that your dad

39:49.830 --> 39:51.758
has been too proud to be proactive

39:51.760 --> 39:55.018
and now the ball is in your court, Jake.

39:55.020 --> 39:56.808
So you can either talk to him

39:56.810 --> 40:01.263
or you can be this whole
like father-like-son thing.

40:05.107 --> 40:06.407
I'm not like him, Jenny.

40:14.020 --> 40:14.853
Well

40:16.250 --> 40:17.650
so what do you think so far?

40:19.590 --> 40:20.838
Yeah.

40:20.840 --> 40:23.368
Well it looks like you dedicated it

40:23.370 --> 40:25.453
to a Sergeant Frank Rogers.

40:28.710 --> 40:30.528
Now I've never had a book dedicated to me,

40:30.530 --> 40:33.838
but some guy I've never
heard of gets one from you.

40:33.840 --> 40:37.613
Sergeant Rogers saved my
life back in Hue in Vietnam.

40:41.450 --> 40:44.128
I thought you were
supposed to be the war hero

40:44.130 --> 40:45.508
or is that just how
the media played it out

40:45.510 --> 40:46.968
for your last press tour?

40:46.970 --> 40:50.263
Rogers was the man who
introduced me to Jesus.

40:52.860 --> 40:54.013
That long ago?

40:56.920 --> 40:59.408
Where was that Jesus when
I was growin' up, Herb?

40:59.410 --> 41:02.478
He's supposed to be a loving,
selfless father, right?

41:02.480 --> 41:04.283
Full of grace, hope, love.

41:06.710 --> 41:08.433
Rogers planted the seeds.

41:09.840 --> 41:11.628
He made the introduction to the Lord

41:11.630 --> 41:15.923
and I'm not proud that it
took 40 years to take root.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.513
I can't give you back
your childhood, Jake.

41:22.570 --> 41:25.348
We're just gonna have to find
a way to go on from here.

41:25.350 --> 41:28.418
The least you coulda done
was dedicate book to me.

41:28.420 --> 41:30.203
That book's not dedicated to you.

41:31.380 --> 41:32.583
It's written for ya.

41:35.850 --> 41:37.088
What?

41:37.090 --> 41:38.203
I wrote it for you.

41:40.108 --> 41:43.508
I mean you know, I'm
not good at opening up.

41:43.510 --> 41:46.538
It's not how men were back in my day,

41:46.540 --> 41:50.738
but I'm good with a pen and some words.

41:50.740 --> 41:52.650
And so I wrote a story

41:53.820 --> 41:57.030
to try to show you the
length that a man would go to

41:58.110 --> 41:59.653
to find the son that he lost.

42:02.500 --> 42:03.700
You wrote this for me.

42:05.060 --> 42:06.073
Nobody else.

42:07.167 --> 42:09.358
"The New York Times," the paycheck.

42:09.360 --> 42:10.818
Oh, god.

42:10.820 --> 42:12.838
I'm donatin' all the
money I make from that

42:12.840 --> 42:14.213
to a veteran's charity.

42:15.220 --> 42:16.870
I'll just keep reading it then.

42:18.820 --> 42:20.848
Read it out loud.

42:20.850 --> 42:22.250
That'll be music to my ears.

43:02.020 --> 43:03.165
Who is he, Herod?

43:03.167 --> 43:05.508
The one on that slab as Ike Capra.

43:05.510 --> 43:06.843
He's the head pella.

43:07.710 --> 43:09.688
His associate, Joji Gatti.

43:09.690 --> 43:11.728
Two doors down, Billy Gallow.

43:11.730 --> 43:14.448
Bottom drawer, Cole Gamble.

43:14.450 --> 43:16.003
I wanted you to see this.

43:16.930 --> 43:19.318
You've done some top-notch
work for my crew.

43:19.320 --> 43:20.658
I trust you been happy.

43:20.660 --> 43:21.898
Yes, sir.

43:21.900 --> 43:22.938
Feels like family.

43:22.940 --> 43:23.958
That's good.

43:23.960 --> 43:25.199
I like that.

43:33.270 --> 43:34.113
Cole Gamble.

43:37.350 --> 43:38.183
My father

43:40.290 --> 43:42.491
always used to say, "It's best
to work with people you like,

43:42.493 --> 43:45.088
people you trust."

43:45.090 --> 43:45.973
Am I right?

43:48.405 --> 43:49.238
I like ya, Cole.

43:50.150 --> 43:51.658
You know how to use the old grape.

43:51.660 --> 43:54.008
You got a good head on your shoulders.

43:54.010 --> 43:57.698
But when you work with people you like,

43:57.700 --> 43:59.973
you open yourself up to betrayal.

44:01.100 --> 44:03.957
Ya like 'em, so you don't see it comin'.

44:06.310 --> 44:09.773
Fortunately, my father, he
learned that lesson the hard way.

44:10.800 --> 44:12.838
Yeah, business partner.

44:12.840 --> 44:15.158
Loved him like a brother,

44:15.160 --> 44:17.052
even drank from the same bottle.

44:17.054 --> 44:18.793
Who knew?

44:20.560 --> 44:21.543
And then one day,

44:22.600 --> 44:26.113
he found out this man
was not a friend at all.

44:27.910 --> 44:30.433
Tried to work it out,
give him another chance,

44:31.570 --> 44:34.413
but you can't reason with a traitor.

44:35.620 --> 44:40.128
Can't be done, can't do it.

44:40.130 --> 44:44.623
It cost him everything:
his business, his home,

44:46.580 --> 44:47.643
his life.

44:49.534 --> 44:52.898
Now had it been me, wouldn't
have been a second chance,

44:52.900 --> 44:54.048
wouldn't have happened.

44:54.050 --> 44:55.920
I woulda hunted him down

44:57.100 --> 44:59.148
and took back everything that was mine

44:59.150 --> 45:02.600
and maybe a few things that weren't.

45:02.602 --> 45:04.168
'Course it's what my old man said,

45:04.170 --> 45:06.352
I could never keep friends.

45:06.354 --> 45:10.883
What are you gonna do?

45:14.880 --> 45:16.430
What's that gotta do with me?

45:17.860 --> 45:19.083
Your father,

45:20.710 --> 45:22.828
the two-faced gumshoe,

45:22.830 --> 45:25.398
filled these three gents full of daylight.

45:25.400 --> 45:28.268
Johnny Gamble's not my father.

45:28.270 --> 45:30.710
Never was, never has been.

45:32.899 --> 45:33.732
Are you sure?

45:35.030 --> 45:38.563
'Cause when we find him,
we're gonna kill him

45:39.500 --> 45:42.073
slowly, painfully.

45:42.960 --> 45:46.698
And I don't need any tears
or changes of heart from you,

45:46.700 --> 45:48.278
you understand me?

45:48.280 --> 45:53.280
This man murdered my friends
and he never cared about you.

45:55.740 --> 45:58.183
You're more of a
father than he ever was.

46:00.051 --> 46:01.398
There you go.

46:01.400 --> 46:02.398
Yeah,

46:02.400 --> 46:04.013
makes sense to me.

46:04.870 --> 46:06.170
Just wanna be sure though.

46:07.880 --> 46:11.023
When we find him and he pulls a gun,

46:12.660 --> 46:13.793
you got my back?

46:14.840 --> 46:16.885
Of course I have your back.

46:35.954 --> 46:37.378
Trust me.

46:37.380 --> 46:39.230
The hooch ain't gonna make it better.

46:42.512 --> 46:44.638
Don't you have a son to find?

46:44.640 --> 46:47.393
I just thought I'd take a
breather before I dust out.

46:49.320 --> 46:52.278
Well feel free to dust on out.

46:52.280 --> 46:54.530
I thought I might
could tip the bill first.

46:58.270 --> 46:59.758
Whiskey?

46:59.760 --> 47:00.943
Water, if you got it.

47:03.500 --> 47:04.333
I don't.

47:05.680 --> 47:07.583
I think I'll pass.

47:08.457 --> 47:10.625
You enjoyin' the journey so far?

47:10.627 --> 47:11.877
It's not bad.

47:13.820 --> 47:14.743
It's not bad.

47:15.990 --> 47:19.183
It's no Raymond Chandler,
but it's not bad.

47:20.486 --> 47:22.308
Well it's not my character to impose,

47:22.310 --> 47:24.017
so I guess I'll just be on my...

47:25.414 --> 47:26.890
What happened

47:28.470 --> 47:30.161
between and your son?

47:30.163 --> 47:31.413
Because the book,

47:34.804 --> 47:35.693
it doesn't say.

47:41.140 --> 47:43.223
A lifetime of mistakes.

47:44.140 --> 47:45.418
Any words of wisdom for me?

47:45.420 --> 47:47.120
You are talkin' to the wrong guy

47:48.390 --> 47:51.123
because I'm in a similar
situation with my own father.

47:52.250 --> 47:53.228
That's why I was asking.

47:53.230 --> 47:54.948
I was hoping you could shed some light,

47:54.950 --> 47:58.738
but apparently that's too much to ask for.

47:58.740 --> 48:00.813
Family can be a busted flush.

48:02.270 --> 48:03.248
Tryin'' to make sense of it,

48:03.250 --> 48:06.918
you wind up behind the old eight ball.

48:06.920 --> 48:08.670
What, are you dyin' or somethin'?

48:10.680 --> 48:13.660
Why else would you go look
for him after all these years?

48:13.662 --> 48:15.258
Well I did him wrong.

48:15.260 --> 48:18.210
I'm not proud of it, so I'm
fightin' hard to make it right.

48:21.733 --> 48:24.120
Well brother, fair warning

48:25.990 --> 48:28.790
because it does not look like
your boy wants to be found

48:30.184 --> 48:34.170
and so it might not go well for you.

48:37.880 --> 48:41.128
Every lost son longs to
be found by his father.

48:41.130 --> 48:42.153
Not all of them.

48:43.290 --> 48:44.428
Well see, now it sounds like

48:44.430 --> 48:46.980
you have a lotta built-up
hate towards your father.

48:47.906 --> 48:49.006
You think that's just?

48:50.020 --> 48:50.853
That

48:52.200 --> 48:53.033
is my father.

48:56.350 --> 48:57.670
I am his son

48:59.018 --> 49:01.803
and he has never told me he loves me.

49:05.159 --> 49:06.576
So you know what?

49:08.150 --> 49:09.403
He can burn in hell.

49:12.090 --> 49:13.640
Thanks for the chitchat, kid.

49:37.692 --> 49:40.359
What, are you bringin' me tea?

49:41.832 --> 49:44.278
I bet that's decaffeinated too.

49:44.280 --> 49:45.388
You really don't like me, do you?

49:45.390 --> 49:47.028
You can't have coffee, Herb.

49:47.030 --> 49:48.588
It'll mess you up.

49:48.590 --> 49:52.393
Jake, I got a
couple of months at best.

49:53.440 --> 49:56.170
I think I can have a cup
of coffee if I want one.

49:57.370 --> 49:58.203
Okay.

50:01.010 --> 50:01.843
Thank you.

50:03.460 --> 50:06.308
So whatever happened
to your Sergeant Rogers?

50:06.310 --> 50:10.043
You know, I lost track of
him years ago, decades ago.

50:11.120 --> 50:12.598
How do you let someone
who meant so much to you

50:12.600 --> 50:13.900
just walk outta your life?

50:15.100 --> 50:18.223
Well he was good man and I wasn't.

50:19.720 --> 50:21.478
Well maybe I was just embarrassed

50:21.480 --> 50:25.033
or didn't feel like I measured up.

50:26.950 --> 50:29.018
Maybe I just didn't understand grace yet.

50:29.020 --> 50:31.068
Maybe you were chasin' too
hard after the things in life

50:31.070 --> 50:34.438
that don't matter to make
good on your relationships.

50:34.440 --> 50:36.640
Well there's no
question about that, Jake.

50:38.200 --> 50:39.850
How are you doin' with that, son?

50:40.840 --> 50:43.138
How are you doin' in your relationships?

50:43.140 --> 50:45.038
Are you chasin' things that don't matter?

50:45.040 --> 50:47.283
Who are you to even sit
here and say that to me?

50:49.660 --> 50:51.960
You just show up on my
doorstep and think that

50:53.570 --> 50:56.093
that writes 30 years
of you just being gone?

50:57.440 --> 50:59.190
Where were you when mom needed you?

51:01.065 --> 51:02.048
I mean c'mon, Herb.

51:02.050 --> 51:03.700
Where were you when I needed you?

51:04.740 --> 51:07.308
I'm not here to defend myself

51:07.310 --> 51:10.828
and I'm not here to
question your life choices,

51:10.830 --> 51:12.663
but I want you to question 'em

51:15.434 --> 51:17.248
and I want you to question 'em

51:17.250 --> 51:21.070
before you're 67 years
old with colon cancer

51:21.910 --> 51:25.352
hooked up to a machine
that's keepin' you alive.

51:30.440 --> 51:31.273
What?

51:32.816 --> 51:34.893
If you weren't dying,
would you be here right now?

51:38.190 --> 51:40.459
Well I'd like to think so.

51:48.320 --> 51:50.270
But at least the coffee didn't kill me.

51:54.589 --> 51:56.289
You got someone here to see you.

51:59.413 --> 52:01.643
Lil' something for you and the kids.

52:03.150 --> 52:05.600
Why don't you get lost,
find some business to do?

52:12.519 --> 52:15.018
Hey, are they're gonna
let you bail me outta here?

52:15.020 --> 52:16.638
Not this time, kid.

52:16.640 --> 52:17.590
What do you mean?

52:18.510 --> 52:21.928
Ya got popped makin' too much noise.

52:21.930 --> 52:23.508
I was just collectin' money for you.

52:23.510 --> 52:25.968
I didn't take any juice
off the top, I swear.

52:25.970 --> 52:27.378
I wouldn't do that to you, Herod.

52:27.380 --> 52:29.403
Nah, it's bigger than that.

52:30.400 --> 52:32.718
You got all the badges
in this town on the take.

52:32.720 --> 52:35.598
All you have to do is say
one word and I'm outta here.

52:35.600 --> 52:37.618
Racketeering,

52:37.620 --> 52:40.409
it brings the feds and their sniffin'.

52:43.177 --> 52:44.927
What are you doin'?

52:45.938 --> 52:49.198
No loose ends tyin' you
back to me or my crew.

52:49.200 --> 52:51.398
Herod, no.

52:51.400 --> 52:52.358
Please.

52:52.360 --> 52:54.173
Sorry it has to be this way, kid.

52:55.650 --> 52:57.891
Business trumps family, you know that.

53:06.500 --> 53:08.028
Goodnight, Herb.

53:08.030 --> 53:09.033
Goodnight, son.

53:14.380 --> 53:16.728
Herod, no.

53:16.730 --> 53:17.638
Please.

53:17.640 --> 53:19.513
Sorry it has to be this way, kid.

53:20.960 --> 53:23.411
Business trumps family, you know that.

53:24.246 --> 53:25.340
See, the thing is

53:27.150 --> 53:28.293
you ain't his family.

53:29.958 --> 53:31.768
Well, well.

53:31.770 --> 53:32.891
How 'bout this?

53:32.893 --> 53:35.193
A Gamble family reunion.

53:36.180 --> 53:38.138
Cole, I've been lookin' for you, son.

53:38.140 --> 53:39.540
You don't have a son here.

53:41.060 --> 53:44.318
Just a shell of a boy who
don't wanna be around you

53:44.320 --> 53:45.963
and that makes two of us.

53:47.070 --> 53:48.463
It's been five years.

53:50.250 --> 53:51.150
How'd you find me?

53:52.310 --> 53:53.458
By tellin' myself every day

53:53.460 --> 53:55.110
that I wouldn't stop until I did.

53:56.830 --> 53:58.053
Cole, listen to me.

53:59.816 --> 54:01.413
Listen to me, the way I treated ya.

54:02.664 --> 54:04.913
The way I treated your
mother, it wasn't right.

54:05.950 --> 54:07.313
I wasn't a standup guy.

54:08.361 --> 54:10.658
Now I can't fix the past,
but I can fix the future

54:10.660 --> 54:11.660
and I'm begging you.

54:13.080 --> 54:16.413
Before the Lord, I beg your forgiveness.

54:18.280 --> 54:20.618
Message of redemption,

54:20.620 --> 54:23.978
last-ditch effort of the weak-minded.

54:23.980 --> 54:26.628
He wants to see your wig split.

54:26.630 --> 54:28.558
He's been beggin' to watch you die

54:28.560 --> 54:30.533
like the dog you are, Gamble.

54:32.720 --> 54:35.520
If love comes from the end
of a barrel, then so be it.

54:37.470 --> 54:38.303
Take it.

54:40.880 --> 54:42.034
Take it.

54:48.200 --> 54:49.150
Go ahead and shoot.

54:51.590 --> 54:52.563
You've ruined me,

54:53.660 --> 54:55.168
abandoned me.

54:55.170 --> 54:57.468
You think you can waltz back into my life.

54:57.470 --> 54:59.298
You think it's that easy?

54:59.300 --> 55:01.050
Nothing about this as easy, Cole.

55:02.850 --> 55:05.250
But if it's the last thing
you ever hear me say,

55:06.730 --> 55:07.563
I love you

55:09.027 --> 55:10.039
and I'm sorry.

55:14.420 --> 55:16.028
I was wrong about you, Cole.

55:16.030 --> 55:17.523
You got some moxie.

55:18.520 --> 55:20.078
Go ahead

55:20.080 --> 55:21.938
pull the trigger.

55:21.940 --> 55:23.118
Go ahead.

55:23.120 --> 55:25.899
I'll push to get you outta this bird, kid.

55:25.901 --> 55:27.063
C'mon, pull it!

55:28.090 --> 55:29.393
Go on, pull it!

55:32.677 --> 55:34.010
Sorry, Gamble.

56:22.453 --> 56:23.628
How you feelin', Herb?

56:23.630 --> 56:25.308
You sure you're up for this road trip?

56:25.310 --> 56:26.308
Where are we goin'?

56:26.310 --> 56:28.058
Three hours, that's
all you need to know.

56:28.060 --> 56:28.891
Three hours?

56:28.893 --> 56:30.378
Gonna miss "Judge Judy."

56:30.380 --> 56:31.388
I'll record it for you.

56:31.390 --> 56:32.878
You went potty, right?

56:32.880 --> 56:33.711
What?

56:33.713 --> 56:34.544
- Potty?
- Potty.

56:34.546 --> 56:35.377
Yeah, I mean it's leather seats.

56:35.379 --> 56:36.278
- Yes, yes.
- I don't want an accident.

56:36.280 --> 56:37.825
I'm not a child, you know?

56:37.827 --> 56:39.477
You are wearin' diapers, right?

56:40.570 --> 56:41.798
Get in the car.

56:41.800 --> 56:44.150
I don't wanna be late
for wherever we're goin'.

56:58.080 --> 56:59.298
So is this it, dad?

56:59.300 --> 57:00.303
We finally here?

57:01.290 --> 57:02.393
Almost there.

57:05.280 --> 57:06.980
I'm guessing it's an in-and-out.

57:08.030 --> 57:10.408
No, but I'll buy you a
double-double on the way home.

57:10.410 --> 57:11.243
I promise.

57:12.360 --> 57:15.308
But we need to pray for the love of God

57:15.310 --> 57:18.548
and grace to be given to
us as was given our savior

57:18.550 --> 57:20.533
when he faced temptations too.

57:23.440 --> 57:26.103
Well hi, you boys here for the class?

57:27.120 --> 57:28.075
Yes, sir.

57:28.077 --> 57:29.403
Are you Frank Rogers?

57:31.410 --> 57:32.898
You military?

57:32.900 --> 57:33.733
No,

57:35.340 --> 57:36.173
but this man is.

57:56.420 --> 57:57.623
You look really old.

57:58.790 --> 58:03.028
Not as bad as you do.

58:03.030 --> 58:04.708
I want everybody to know

58:04.710 --> 58:07.263
that this man right here saved my life.

58:08.640 --> 58:12.138
He's more than just an
author, he's a friend.

58:12.140 --> 58:16.130
Our platoon was a part of the Operation

58:17.170 --> 58:18.240
Cedar Falls

58:19.680 --> 58:21.708
and our main objective was just one thing

58:21.710 --> 58:26.710
and that was to go in and try
to destroy the Iron Triangle.

58:28.420 --> 58:31.138
That meant 30,000 men were gonna descend

58:31.140 --> 58:33.393
on the Viet Cong one time;

58:35.310 --> 58:36.968
all of us knowin' that probably

58:36.970 --> 58:38.433
we weren't gonna make it out.

58:42.250 --> 58:43.700
I'll never forget that night.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.368
The smoke was so thick

58:48.370 --> 58:50.820
you could not even see
your hand in front of you.

58:53.590 --> 58:56.928
The bodies were layin' before
us all bloodied and bruised

58:56.930 --> 58:57.763
and

58:59.210 --> 59:03.923
the men who were soldiers
with us on either side,

59:06.450 --> 59:08.953
they were cryin' out screamin' for help.

59:13.696 --> 59:15.779
You know, times like that

59:18.520 --> 59:20.170
somethin' inside you dies

59:21.740 --> 59:23.940
and you don't know if
you're gonna go crazy.

59:26.300 --> 59:28.240
But I trusted God would be with me

59:30.312 --> 59:32.762
and I trusted that the
Lord would see me through.

59:34.540 --> 59:36.828
They took us by surprise one night.

59:36.830 --> 59:38.608
We never seen 'em comin'.

59:38.610 --> 59:42.580
They tricked us and they caught us

59:43.927 --> 59:46.548
and we'd spend five days in cages.

59:46.550 --> 59:48.793
No food, just rainwater.

59:50.670 --> 59:54.153
Then outta nowhere, this
man just started diggin'

59:55.220 --> 59:57.098
and we couldn't understand
what he was doing

59:57.100 --> 59:58.708
'cause we're thinkin' what is he doin'

59:58.710 --> 01:00:00.258
diggin' in the middle of this place?

01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:02.618
And all of a sudden, we
realized you figured out

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:04.428
that if we could just dig deep enough,

01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:07.318
then maybe, just maybe
we could get outta there.

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:08.988
And so we all started diggin'.

01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:11.953
We dug with our bare hands
and we clawed it out.

01:00:13.191 --> 01:00:14.667
It's like "The Great Escape."

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:16.593
Yeah.

01:00:17.970 --> 01:00:20.778
Yeah, we even gave ourselves code names

01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:24.473
you know, so the VC
wouldn't know our real ones.

01:00:26.730 --> 01:00:27.843
Mine was Bronson.

01:00:29.490 --> 01:00:32.467
I kinda figured you would
coin yourself McQueen.

01:00:32.469 --> 01:00:34.193
Well taken.

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:39.473
Yeah, he does seem cooler than you.

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:45.938
Oh no, everyone else had given up.

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:49.258
Your father single-handedly dug

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:53.053
'til finally there was
a way of escape for us.

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:56.423
I'm here because of him.

01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:03.663
I didn't do it by myself.

01:01:07.967 --> 01:01:10.656
And I wanna tell you a little story

01:01:10.658 --> 01:01:13.448
about how this man saved my life.

01:01:13.450 --> 01:01:17.023
But I expect that since y'all
spent some time with him,

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.674
you already know what I mean.

01:01:25.830 --> 01:01:26.830
You're a good man.

01:01:27.790 --> 01:01:29.193
Don't you forget it.

01:02:04.624 --> 01:02:05.457
Oh, hey.

01:02:08.077 --> 01:02:10.193
Thank you for today, Jacob.

01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:14.053
Yeah, no problem.

01:02:17.437 --> 01:02:19.558
Listen, I gotta get back work tomorrow,

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:21.338
but I can leave some
cereal out or somethin'

01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:23.578
on the counter for breakfast.

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:26.588
Oh, you don't have to do that.

01:02:26.590 --> 01:02:28.950
I have a nurse comin' in durin' the day

01:02:31.039 --> 01:02:34.448
and I can ask her to stay
at night too if it's easier.

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:36.323
No, I can handle the night shift.

01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:38.263
Okay.

01:02:39.370 --> 01:02:41.320
Well that's a shame, she's pretty cute.

01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:46.394
Did you tell her I was rich?

01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:54.883
Dude, mom used to love it
when you played that for us.

01:02:59.710 --> 01:03:00.910
I guess I kinda did too.

01:03:05.668 --> 01:03:09.251
You wanna know why
it took 40 years, son?

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.323
Just so you know,

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:20.120
I thought success was gonna
fill that hole in my chest.

01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:25.823
It won't.

01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:31.160
Just keep that in mind.

01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:37.600
Hey, have you finished that book?

01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:40.853
Not yet.

01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:45.360
Well I got another one
that I want you to read.

01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:49.666
I put it in there on your bed.

01:03:55.692 --> 01:03:56.525
Sure.

01:03:59.595 --> 01:04:01.118
Goodnight, Herb.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.716
Goodnight, son.

01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:35.428
Hey, I'll be in around 10:30.

01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:37.878
Okay, you had me
scheduling the 9:30 today.

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:39.448
Just push it.

01:05:39.450 --> 01:05:40.281
I don't know.

01:05:40.283 --> 01:05:41.249
It's Gary Sullivan.

01:05:41.251 --> 01:05:42.308
He only wants to talk to you.

01:05:42.310 --> 01:05:44.418
You know how much he pays
for his company's retainer?

01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:46.753
Yeah, you know what?

01:05:46.755 --> 01:05:47.586
Push it.

01:05:47.588 --> 01:05:49.158
I'm makin' breakfast for
Herb before I come in.

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:51.708
Okay, well that is
absolutely worth pushin' for.

01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:52.541
Thanks, Jenny.

01:05:52.543 --> 01:05:53.374
I'll see you in a bit.

01:05:53.376 --> 01:05:54.207
Okay and I'll have your coffee

01:05:54.209 --> 01:05:55.040
on your desk ready for you.

01:05:55.042 --> 01:05:56.292
I got some here but thank you.

01:05:56.294 --> 01:05:57.125
What?

01:05:57.127 --> 01:05:58.254
Okay, I'll see you in a few.

01:05:58.256 --> 01:05:59.089
Bye.

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:03.048
Herb, I got some eggs here for ya.

01:06:03.050 --> 01:06:04.483
Breakfast of champions.

01:06:05.790 --> 01:06:06.640
Come on, wake up.

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:10.193
Hey, Herb.

01:06:12.270 --> 01:06:13.243
Herb, wake up.

01:06:15.970 --> 01:06:17.978
Let's go, you can't stay in bed all day.

01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:18.850
Get up.

01:06:21.183 --> 01:06:22.016
Herb?

01:06:24.351 --> 01:06:25.182
Herb, come on.

01:06:25.184 --> 01:06:26.017
Wake up.

01:06:28.061 --> 01:06:28.992
Herb.

01:07:16.463 --> 01:07:17.294
Someone once said

01:07:17.296 --> 01:07:19.323
that good decisions come from experience.

01:07:20.790 --> 01:07:23.093
Experience comes from
makin' bad decisions.

01:07:25.810 --> 01:07:27.823
He wasn't tryin' to fix all the wrongs.

01:07:29.050 --> 01:07:30.218
He was just tryin' to do right

01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:31.770
with the time that he had left.

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:37.988
What are you gonna say to
your son now that you found him?

01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.823
You tell me.

01:07:45.022 --> 01:07:47.060
I didn't read the end.

01:07:47.062 --> 01:07:47.895
Why not?

01:07:52.472 --> 01:07:55.139
I think it would only ruin it.

01:08:00.708 --> 01:08:01.541
Hey.

01:08:10.724 --> 01:08:12.307
What would you say?

01:08:14.053 --> 01:08:16.033
You know what I would tell my son?

01:08:19.576 --> 01:08:22.595
Let it go.

01:08:22.596 --> 01:08:24.323
Let it go and get right.

01:08:26.049 --> 01:08:28.649
Nothin' more important to
me than you gettin' right.

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:33.042
Take it from an imperfect father.

01:08:34.736 --> 01:08:36.736
I was a terrible father and you know it,

01:08:38.410 --> 01:08:40.932
but you know what you deserve
and you know what I deserve.

01:08:43.502 --> 01:08:46.272
I would do anything to get
you back because I love you.

01:08:48.450 --> 01:08:49.783
God loves you more.

01:08:51.553 --> 01:08:53.602
He gave his only son that you could live.

01:08:54.850 --> 01:08:56.283
You have a perfect father.

01:08:57.951 --> 01:08:59.932
Run to him, this is life and death.

01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:03.343
Let it go.

01:09:04.895 --> 01:09:06.328
Get right.

01:09:15.729 --> 01:09:18.063
well I guess this is where I

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:19.794
dust out.

01:09:22.522 --> 01:09:23.423
I love you, dad.

01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:26.098
No, no, no.

01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:28.180
But we changed the rates

01:11:28.182 --> 01:11:29.467
- and we changed the...
- Okay.

01:11:29.469 --> 01:11:30.818
Just to expand the scope.

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:31.820
And this...

01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:33.573
Jake.

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:35.271
Charlie.

01:11:35.273 --> 01:11:36.104
I'm so sorry.

01:11:36.106 --> 01:11:37.108
We didn't know you were
supposed to be in today.

01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:39.068
- We were just usin' the space.
- It's okay.

01:11:39.070 --> 01:11:40.570
This office looks good on you.

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:43.738
Sorry to hear about your father.

01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:44.738
Yeah.

01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:45.590
Thank you, Harry.

01:11:46.690 --> 01:11:47.740
He was a great man.

01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:50.221
He was.

01:11:50.223 --> 01:11:52.727
He did his best with
what was given to him.

01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:54.403
Yeah.

01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:58.218
It's probably better that
we don't have you know,

01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:00.398
personal contact without the mediator.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.367
I'll sign the paperwork.

01:12:02.369 --> 01:12:03.968
You will?

01:12:03.970 --> 01:12:04.803
Yeah.

01:12:05.686 --> 01:12:06.519
Yeah, I will.

01:12:08.410 --> 01:12:10.060
I could use a break from all this

01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:14.050
and I haven't been the best
partner to either of you

01:12:16.230 --> 01:12:17.839
and I hope you'll forgive me.

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.233
Apology accepted.

01:12:25.386 --> 01:12:26.680
Thank you, Harry.

01:12:26.682 --> 01:12:28.182
Thank you, Jake.

01:12:30.744 --> 01:12:32.994
Charlie, what do you say?

01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:36.360
Yeah.

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:39.838
Hey, if you guys ever
have any 501-C charities

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:42.173
come through, you think you
can refer them over to me?

01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:47.768
That's new.

01:12:47.770 --> 01:12:49.798
I'm workin' on some things.

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:50.768
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

01:12:50.770 --> 01:12:51.778
- Of course.
- No problem.

01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:52.613
Thank you.

01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:55.787
Well great.

01:12:55.789 --> 01:12:59.338
This was helpful and I hope
you guys have a good day.

01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:01.313
I'll see you soon.

01:13:03.670 --> 01:13:04.503
Probably not.

01:13:08.432 --> 01:13:09.264
I don't even.

01:13:09.266 --> 01:13:10.099
I have no idea.

01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:15.108
So why am I here?

01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:17.478
Because what you're doing
can have a profound impact

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:20.230
and I did not take you
seriously enough the first time.

01:13:21.816 --> 01:13:24.143
It was my mistake and I want
you to know that I'm all-in.

01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:28.248
Like I said before,

01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:30.278
I don't want this to be for-profit.

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:31.113
Neither do I.

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:35.333
Okay.

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:38.588
I've already started
setting up the charity.

01:13:38.590 --> 01:13:39.818
I'll take care of it from here.

01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:40.682
I got it covered.

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:42.510
It's all on me now.

01:13:44.209 --> 01:13:45.243
I wanna do this.

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:48.048
Okay.

01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:49.141
Okay.

01:13:49.143 --> 01:13:51.617
I appreciate it.

01:13:51.619 --> 01:13:52.698
What's the next step?

01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:53.531
Well there's a sergeant

01:13:53.533 --> 01:13:54.457
running a help group for veterans

01:13:54.459 --> 01:13:55.918
I would love for you to meet.

01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:57.318
He served in Vietnam.

01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:58.151
If you're still looking

01:13:58.153 --> 01:14:00.200
for those kinda charities to help you out.

01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:03.537
So what's the timeframe look like

01:14:03.539 --> 01:14:04.990
for us to get up and running?

01:14:06.369 --> 01:14:08.170
I've got one more thing to tackle,

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.986
but I promise you it's a priority.
