Never give a speech
on an empty stomach.

and peanut butter sandwich!

we can't get in
through the front.

I just wanted Papa
to make a new friend.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.816
But I made everything worse.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.735
It's true.
Dad has no friends.

07:23.735 --> 07:25.987
But he's got us!
Family!

07:25.987 --> 07:27.614
And we'll always
be there for him,

07:27.614 --> 07:30.241
even after Chip ruins
his reputation later today.

07:30.241 --> 07:33.370

to find another exit.

‐Hey, Gramma.
‐Can you let us
into the building?

07:42.170 --> 07:45.465

my swag out this way anyway.

so good luck with that.

What up, Farm‐Con!
My name is Bill Green!

08:32.053 --> 08:35.014
Oh, no, Chip has assumed
Papa's identity!

08:35.014 --> 08:38.268
As the humble, urban farmer
I am, I'd just like to say...

08:38.268 --> 08:41.187
I'm the <i>only</i> good farmer
in this city!

08:41.187 --> 08:44.441
You're all dumb!
Dumb, dumb, dummies!

08:44.441 --> 08:45.650
[all gasp]

08:45.650 --> 08:47.444
Oh, no! We gotta hurry!

08:47.444 --> 08:49.070
I can't believe
you made me choose

08:49.070 --> 08:51.322
between my son
and my swag.

08:51.322 --> 08:52.657
[grunts] Come on, let's go!

08:52.657 --> 08:53.825
That's fine,

08:53.825 --> 08:55.535
let Gramma pick up your mess.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.078
That's right, I said it.

08:57.078 --> 09:00.040
Oh, and your veggies? Garbo!

09:00.040 --> 09:02.208
[muffled speech]

09:02.208 --> 09:04.711
Yeah! I love pesticide!

09:04.711 --> 09:06.880
‐[both scream]
‐Not the teeth! Not the teeth!

09:06.880 --> 09:08.673
Good work, Cricket!
Hold him down!

09:08.673 --> 09:11.134
People of Farm‐Con!

09:11.134 --> 09:13.219
This man is not Bill Green!

09:13.219 --> 09:15.221
‐That is Bill Green!
‐[grunts]

09:15.221 --> 09:17.223
[muffled speech]

09:17.223 --> 09:18.683
Two Bill Greens?

09:18.683 --> 09:20.060
Which one do I shoot?

09:20.060 --> 09:21.519
Which one do I shoot?!

09:21.519 --> 09:24.147
‐Who's the real one?
‐He is.

09:24.147 --> 09:25.148
[gasps]

09:25.148 --> 09:26.232
[muffled speech]

09:26.232 --> 09:27.358
That's my friend

09:27.358 --> 09:29.319
and I'd know him anywhere.

09:29.319 --> 09:30.779
Say "ahh," Papa.

09:30.779 --> 09:33.156
Huh? [gurgling]

09:33.156 --> 09:35.617
Thanks, sweetie.
[blubbers]

09:35.617 --> 09:39.162
Papa, I'm really sorry
Chip didn't turn out
to be a good friend.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.081
Yeah, me too.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.373
How are you so heavy?!

09:42.373 --> 09:44.125
I'm dense!

09:44.125 --> 09:45.668
Huh? Ugh.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.170
Chip, I'm afraid after this,

09:47.170 --> 09:49.005
we can't be friendly anymore.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.507
[scoffs] Like I care.

09:50.507 --> 09:51.966
Watch your back, Bill Green.

09:51.966 --> 09:54.135
'Cause I'll get you all
sooner or later.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.804
When you least expect‐‐

09:55.804 --> 09:57.931
‐[groans]
‐[grunts] Success!

09:57.931 --> 09:59.766
Well, time to go
to the pawn shop.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.351
‐[grunting]
‐[groans]

10:01.351 --> 10:03.103
Huh? Ha!

10:03.103 --> 10:06.439
My new titanium tooth
is still perfectly intact!

10:06.439 --> 10:08.149
Huh? [gasps]

10:08.149 --> 10:10.276
Don't look at me!
Don't look at me!

10:10.276 --> 10:12.904
I'm not even gonna laugh.
I have nightmares about that.

10:12.904 --> 10:14.489
Everyone OK over here?

10:14.489 --> 10:16.658
Joe! It's been so long!

10:16.658 --> 10:18.576
Oh, it's great to see you again!

10:18.576 --> 10:19.577
Likewise.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.079
Listen, Bill,

10:21.079 --> 10:23.081
I'm sorry we lost touch
when you moved.

10:23.081 --> 10:25.792
I planned on visitin' but
I went out to tend the crops

10:25.792 --> 10:27.627
and well, you know...

10:27.627 --> 10:29.129
[chuckles] Boy, do I.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.173
What do ya say we catch up
over a nice glass of water?

10:32.173 --> 10:33.675
My favorite beverage,

10:33.675 --> 10:35.093
you remembered!

10:35.093 --> 10:36.344
Good Ol' Joe.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.679
Good Ol' Bill.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.055
Good Ol' Joe.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.265
Good Ol' Bill.

10:40.265 --> 10:41.933
‐Good Ol'‐‐
‐Dad! Speech!

10:41.933 --> 10:43.476
Oh! Right!
Wish me luck!

10:43.476 --> 10:45.937
Well, we didn't find
Papa a new friend.

10:45.937 --> 10:47.814
But we did find him
an old friend.

10:47.814 --> 10:48.815
Yeah.

10:48.815 --> 10:49.816
Wait, did we?

10:49.816 --> 10:50.817
I'm countin' it.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.152
[clears throat]

10:52.152 --> 10:53.987
Hello, my name
is Bill Green

10:53.987 --> 10:58.032
and I'm here to talk about
urban soil and crop rotation.

10:58.032 --> 10:59.284
[all cheer]

10:59.284 --> 11:00.994
I love Farm‐Con!
