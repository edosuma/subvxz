It'll only hurt for a second.

Hmm. Hmm.

(HUMMING)

01:29.047 --> 01:31.175
You really like chopping wood, huh?

01:31.550 --> 01:33.097
I'm not chopping wood.

01:33.093 --> 01:36.347
I made a toothpick
from the ancient elm. See?

01:36.722 --> 01:39.601
Oh! (CHUCKLES) Whoa!

01:41.351 --> 01:42.728
Uh, knock, knock.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.855
What the dip, Marceline?

01:45.230 --> 01:46.732
Sorry. It was supposed to be a joke.

01:47.858 --> 01:51.237
Actually, I have something
really serious to ask.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.956
I want you to do the procedure,
the one we talked about.

01:55.324 --> 01:58.203
I'm sorry, but I don't think
you'd make a good blonde.

01:58.493 --> 01:59.870
No, not that.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.497
I don't want to be a vampire anymore.

02:02.623 --> 02:05.001
(GASPS) Oh, my globness.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.753
You said you were working on a cure, right?

02:07.878 --> 02:11.428
(SIGHS) Well, the machine is built
and the serums are ready,

02:11.423 --> 02:14.051
but are you sure you want to do this?

02:14.259 --> 02:15.556
I'm sure.

02:15.552 --> 02:18.055
Some bad things happened
to me when I was little.

02:18.055 --> 02:21.059
When I became a vampire,
I was just a messed-up kid.

02:21.516 --> 02:24.395
Now it's 1,000 years later,
and I'm still messed up.

02:26.146 --> 02:30.196
I don't want to spend eternity
like this, with this emptiness.

02:30.817 --> 02:31.909
I want to grow up.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.412
Okay. Let's do this.

02:37.783 --> 02:40.206
BUBBLEGUM: This means
someday you'll die.

02:41.953 --> 02:43.205
You know that, right?

02:44.831 --> 02:48.210
(GULPS) I guess that'll be my last adventure.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.212
Marceline...

02:51.213 --> 02:56.720
I'm so very, very, very excited
to test my new lab out on you.

02:58.970 --> 03:01.223
Well, don't get all sentimental on me.

03:04.601 --> 03:05.853
Come on over here.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.860
You know I care about you.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.941
I think you're making the right choice.

03:11.441 --> 03:15.321
Your natural life-span is going to be richer
and fuller than you can imagine.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.583
And someday, when you die,

03:19.991 --> 03:21.993
I'll be the one who puts you in the ground.

03:25.247 --> 03:28.251
But, you know, this operation
might not even work.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.378
MARCELINE: Whoa! (SCREAMS).

03:32.129 --> 03:34.131
This tickles really bad!

03:36.758 --> 03:38.886
(GROANS) Did it work?

03:39.010 --> 03:42.230
Well, I sucked all your vampire
effluvium into this bucket.

03:42.639 --> 03:46.018
Possibly, we won't know
the results for a couple of days.

03:46.143 --> 03:48.771
In the meantime, you need
to get plenty of rest.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.148
I'll check your vitals in the morning.

03:51.148 --> 03:52.866

It's an expert job.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.168
She used to be my best cream cow.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.510
But now her milk is nonfat.

04:55.045 --> 04:58.049
And Nanette, my beautiful calf is decaf!

04:59.299 --> 05:00.892
That's terrible!

05:01.176 --> 05:03.178

05:12.312 --> 05:15.065
Wait a minute. We don't even
know if Marceline did this.

05:15.398 --> 05:18.572
That's right. I forgot about 000's
extensive vampire community.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.446
(IMITATES BUZZER) Come on!

05:20.821 --> 05:22.949
Yeah, but we need to conduct
a proper investigation.

05:23.448 --> 05:24.825
I know that.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.042
Ain't no rookie.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.582
All right, come on.
I'll let you be bad cop.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.080
I'm already bad cop.

05:30.539 --> 05:31.961
Okay, listen up, hayseeds.

05:32.040 --> 05:35.169
Me and my partner will "interrogate"
the suspect police-style.

05:35.460 --> 05:39.465
Meanwhile, you sharpen up
your pitchforks mob-style.

05:39.548 --> 05:40.800

05:41.091 --> 05:43.594
Hey, man, that's not right.
Marceline's our friend.

05:55.105 --> 05:57.483
Don't go nigh-nigh, Marcy. I'm worried.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.110
For real? Why?

05:59.442 --> 06:03.367
Well, the process was experimental.
Like, are there side effects?

06:03.363 --> 06:05.115
What happened in your sleep last night?

06:05.615 --> 06:08.494
Nobody on record has ever cured vampirism,

06:08.618 --> 06:14.250
unless you count killing vampires as curing.
In that case, you've cured tons, right?

06:14.749 --> 06:16.751
"Tons" is an understatement.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.884
That shnoz was nasty, nasty times.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.014
Oh, hey, guys. How you doing?

06:29.514 --> 06:31.141
Jake did excessive force on me.

I'm sorry.

EW! EW!

Hurry up. Get in here.

06:39.774 --> 06:41.651
You done it this time, Marceline.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.030
You sucked the life
out of defenseless animals.

06:44.279 --> 06:45.781
I ain't done nothing.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.999
You think I'm buying
that boom-boom mountain?

06:48.158 --> 06:49.410
Oh, get some proof.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.252
You want proof? Look.

Proof how off I'm gonna go
if you don't confess.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.636
- Yo, chill, Jake.
- I'm wilin' out!

07:01.046 --> 07:05.051
Listen, Marcy, I can barely control this guy
ancl the villagers are getting crazy.

07:05.175 --> 07:08.145
They want to run you over with a wagon
and I'm offering you a way out.

07:08.803 --> 07:10.931
Hey, dillweeds,
I just swept the place.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.023
Sorry.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.189
- Finn, be real for a second.
- All right.

07:15.185 --> 07:18.064
Look into my eyes, man. I didn't do it.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.202
To be honest, it looks like
you're not sure if you did it.

07:28.198 --> 07:29.700
Okay, I'm not sure!

07:29.699 --> 07:34.330
Something weird happened last night.
I had a weird dream about stuff.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.673
Dream stuff always means something.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.335
We'll figure this out, Marcy, together.

07:39.417 --> 07:40.964
- We promise.
- Thanks, Finn.

07:41.586 --> 07:45.216
That's cool, you guys, but clean
this mess, also, you burns.

07:45.548 --> 07:47.471
He's a gob-gleebin' vampire hugger!

07:47.550 --> 07:48.847
We got to tell the town!

07:49.177 --> 07:50.224
Book it, Terry!

07:51.471 --> 07:54.065
Run, Terry! Run!

07:54.599 --> 07:58.069
How long do we have to stay in
the laundry house, Cloud Dance?

07:58.728 --> 08:00.480
Until Finn and Jake avert the threat.

08:00.939 --> 08:04.739
We can't afford to lose more livestock.
We're struggling as is to keep our kids fed.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.954
Let's just stay in here until the
dirty vampire gets what's coming to her.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.456
But I want to bop her in the nose!

08:10.949 --> 08:14.624
Hey, now, it's too dangerous, okay?
Us small towns, we got to stay close.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.748
Each of us play a vital role
and I can't afford losing any of you.

08:18.206 --> 08:21.255
Not you, Clubhouse Sandy, or you, Seed Man,

08:21.501 --> 08:23.094
or even you, Sandwich Paul.

08:23.253 --> 08:24.505
<i>Sensei Paul.</i>

08:24.629 --> 08:27.098
Let's leave the fighting
to the fighters, okay, Paul?

08:27.757 --> 08:29.384
That hurts. You don't know I teach aikido.

08:30.385 --> 08:31.637
Finn's been turned!

08:32.136 --> 08:33.183
Wha...

08:33.554 --> 08:37.275
- He does the vampire's bidding.
- Well, there it is.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.777

Look at this. It's my new dance.
It's called "I got arthritis."

08:49.279 --> 08:50.576
Oh. The end.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.449
You should have hung back with PB.

08:52.824 --> 08:56.670
But I've got a bad feeling
like you guys are gonna die without me.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.331
Dang, Marcy. Have some faith. Geez.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.087
Guys, look.

09:12.177 --> 09:14.350
- You see it?
- No. But what's that?

09:14.471 --> 09:15.939
FINN: Must be its filthy lair.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.101
- (WHIMPERS)
- What's wrong?

09:19.100 --> 09:22.195
Remember how I said my fear
of vampires was based on ignorance?

09:22.353 --> 09:23.354
Yeah.

09:23.438 --> 09:26.988
Well, I think that revelation
was actually based on true ignorance.

09:27.442 --> 09:29.115
So you're scared of vampires again?

09:29.110 --> 09:30.487
Yeah, man, don't be ignorant.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.615
- Come on.
- Okay, but I'm gonna hold on to your shirt.

09:34.699 --> 09:37.248
Look at these poor babies.
What's happening to them?

09:37.368 --> 09:39.496
(STAMMERING)
You tell me, man.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.248
(WEAKLY) Moo.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.004
I think they're in the process
of being turned, eh?

09:43.708 --> 09:47.008
Ugh, glob. Something big
just dropped in my gut.

09:47.253 --> 09:51.008
- Hang in there, bro.
- I can't be here, man. It's too real.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.634

- Wait, you hear that? Listen.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.011
There!

09:55.095 --> 09:57.348

Dang! Lost him!

10:10.360 --> 10:12.488
Marcy? Hey, Marcy, you still out here?

10:12.654 --> 10:14.406
She's still out here, all right.

10:14.405 --> 10:16.658
Oh, hey, man.
Did you see a scary beast go by?

10:16.866 --> 10:18.163
I chased it out here, but it got away.

10:18.660 --> 10:21.914
Oh, we found that beast
and we took care of her real nice...

10:22.163 --> 10:23.380
You vampire hugger!

10:23.498 --> 10:25.296
- Wait, what?
- Lookum yonder.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.877
What the blood?

What? I'm the good guy here.

Oh, flip, you're right.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.661
This is way messed up.
