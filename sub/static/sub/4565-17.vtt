00:03.571 --> 00:05.404
FAMILY GAME NIGHT.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.906
MY FAVORITE NIGHT
OF THE MONTH.

00:07.908 --> 00:11.410
JUST ME, MY FAMILY,
AND MY 'JAMA PANTS.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.812
WHY DO YOU GUYS
HAVE TO MAKE

00:13.814 --> 00:15.614
SUCH A BIG DEAL
ABOUT GAME NIGHT?

00:15.616 --> 00:18.217
BECAUSE GAME NIGHT
IS SACRED, RILEY.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.785
( chuckles )

00:19.786 --> 00:21.352
I KNOW THIS IS GONNA COME
AS A SHOCK TO YOU,

00:21.355 --> 00:23.889
BUT THERE'S GONNA COME A DAY
WHERE YOU START TO PRIORITIZE

00:23.891 --> 00:25.691
FRIENDS OVER YOUR FAMILY.

00:25.693 --> 00:29.461
WHAT? NO.

00:30.431 --> 00:31.497
DID YOU TELL THEM YET?

00:31.499 --> 00:32.798
DID HE FREAK?
DID SHE TELL YOU?

00:32.800 --> 00:33.799
DID YOU FREAK?
SHOW ME WHAT YOU DID.

00:33.801 --> 00:34.867
FREAK OUT FOR ME.

00:35.803 --> 00:36.969
WHY WOULD I FREAK OUT?

00:36.971 --> 00:38.570
I DON'T FREAK OUT.

00:38.572 --> 00:39.638
WHAT DID YOU DO?!

00:42.410 --> 00:45.811
FAMILY GAME NIGHT,
NOW WITH EXTRA FAMILY.

00:45.813 --> 00:47.746
WELL, HELLO.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.282
WELL, HELLO.

00:51.719 --> 00:52.985
AUGGIE DIDN'T WANT TO
MISS GAME NIGHT.

00:52.987 --> 00:54.620
WE NEVER MADE IT
OUT OF THE CITY.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.221
OH, HERE'S YOUR MONEY.

00:57.792 --> 00:58.991
HEY, THIS IS A DOLLAR.

00:58.993 --> 01:00.426
I GAVE YOU A HUNDRED.

01:00.428 --> 01:01.593
WITH THAT KIND OF MONEY,

01:01.595 --> 01:02.861
YOU THINK WE'RE
NOT GONNA BUY STEAKS?

01:02.863 --> 01:05.931
THANK YOU, PAPA.

01:05.933 --> 01:07.633

01:07.635 --> 01:08.634

01:22.148 --> 01:23.314
I THOUGHT WE HAD
A FEW MORE YEARS.

01:23.317 --> 01:24.616

01:24.618 --> 01:25.884
IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

01:25.886 --> 01:27.753
RILEY INVITED HER FRIENDS

01:27.755 --> 01:29.822
RILEY, SHNOOKUMS.

01:29.824 --> 01:32.825
UM, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
START TO PRIORITIZE

01:32.827 --> 01:34.660
WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU,

01:34.662 --> 01:35.661
YOUR FAMILY, HUH?

01:35.663 --> 01:36.929
OR YOUR FRIENDS?

01:36.931 --> 01:37.963
THERE IS ONLY ONE RIGHT ANSWER.

01:37.965 --> 01:39.364

- WRONG ANSWER.

01:39.366 --> 01:40.866
- HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN--
- WRONG ANSWER.

01:40.868 --> 01:42.835

01:44.004 --> 01:45.437

02:51.372 --> 02:52.938
YOU THINK IT'S EASY?

02:54.408 --> 02:55.874
SAY GOODBYE TO
YOUR DAUGHTER, HONEY.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.843
SHE HAS CHOSEN HER FRIENDS
OVER HER FAMILY.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.945
WHY CAN'T WE JUST
PLAY WITH HER FRIENDS.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.947
BECAUSE TOPANGA,

03:01.948 --> 03:03.948
THE SECOND SHE ALLOWED
DR. TURTLENECK AND MR. HOWDY

03:03.951 --> 03:05.534
INTO OUR HOUSEHOLD,

03:05.535 --> 03:07.118
OUR FAMILY WAS COMPROMISED
BY INTERLOPERS.

03:12.026 --> 03:14.092
MAYBE WE COULD JUST
COME BACK ANOTHER TIME.

03:14.094 --> 03:17.829
OH, YEAH, WE DON'T HAVE WALLS.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.898
I TOLD YOU
WE NEEDED WALLS, TOPANGA.

03:21.468 --> 03:22.834
DR. TURTLENECK, I PRESUME.

03:22.836 --> 03:24.436
HOW COULD YOU TELL?

03:24.438 --> 03:27.673
OH, BECAUSE-- YOU JUST
SEEM LIKE A DOCTOR TO ME.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.074
- THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU.

03:30.144 --> 03:31.143
AND YOU MUST BE...

03:31.145 --> 03:33.378
HOWDY.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.913
SEE THIS?

03:34.915 --> 03:37.416
THE FAMILY GAME.

03:37.418 --> 03:40.852
THE GAME FOR FAMILIES.

03:40.854 --> 03:43.922
NOT THE FRIENDS GAME,
A GAME FOR FRIENDS.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.524
I SAW THAT GAME.

03:45.526 --> 03:47.859
I DIDN'T BUY THAT GAME.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.027
I BOUGHT THIS ONE

03:49.029 --> 03:50.929
BECAUSE I USED TO HAVE A FAMILY.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.431
WILL YOU STOP?

03:52.433 --> 03:54.499
HOW COULD SHE CHOOSE
HER FRIENDS OVER US?

03:54.501 --> 03:56.768
I MEAN, DID THEY BURP HER?

03:56.770 --> 03:58.103
DID THEY CHANGE HER DIAPERS?

03:58.105 --> 04:01.873
WE HAVEN'T YET,
BUT WE WILL WHEN SHE'S OLD.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.609
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF, HONEY.

04:03.611 --> 04:06.411
I KNOW THAT I HAVE THE ABSOLUTE
LOVE AND LOYALTY OF MY CHILDREN

04:06.413 --> 04:08.180
WHO LIKE ME FINE
AND ALWAYS WILL.

04:08.182 --> 04:10.649
EVERYBODY'S HERE.
EVERYBODY PLAYS.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.985
CORY, FLIPPING OUT
IS ONLY GONNA MAKE THINGS WORSE.

04:12.987 --> 04:14.820
DO YOU REALLY WANT
TO DRIVE HER AWAY?

04:14.822 --> 04:16.405
YEAH, DAD.

04:16.406 --> 04:17.989
IT'S LIKE WHAT
YOU WERE TEACHING TODAY.

04:17.992 --> 04:20.192
I WAS TEACHING ABOUT
THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, RILEY.

04:20.194 --> 04:22.561
HOW IS THIS ANYTHING LIKE
THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION?

04:22.563 --> 04:23.662
HOW?

04:23.664 --> 04:25.097
LET'S THINK.

04:25.099 --> 04:28.600
<i>( patriotic music playing )</i>

04:31.472 --> 04:33.872
THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION.

04:33.874 --> 04:36.808
IMAGINE ENGLAND AS A FATHER.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.877
AND AMERICA, IT'S CHILD.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.912
KNOWING IT'S TIME TO BREAK AWAY.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.648
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

04:42.650 --> 04:45.484
I GIVE YOU
THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.

04:47.554 --> 04:49.988
SUBJECTS.

04:49.990 --> 04:53.625
IT IS I, KING GEORGE III,

04:53.627 --> 04:55.727
RULER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE.

04:55.729 --> 05:00.065
NOW, WHERE IS
THAT REBELLIOUS JOHN ADAMS?

05:00.067 --> 05:04.936
WHO DARES CHOOSES
HIS AMERICAN FRIENDS
OVER HIS KING?

05:04.938 --> 05:06.638
HERE I AM!

05:06.640 --> 05:08.974
JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.743
RILEY, UH,
YOU'RE ACTUALLY JOHN ADAMS.

05:11.745 --> 05:12.978
WHO'S THAT?

05:12.980 --> 05:14.479
JOHN ADAMS WAS THE FATHER
OF JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.

05:14.481 --> 05:15.814
BUT OUR SCHOOL
IS JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.015
MY SCHOOL WAS JOHN ADAMS.

05:17.017 --> 05:17.916
YOUR SCHOOL WAS THE FATHER
OF MY SCHOOL?

05:17.918 --> 05:18.917
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TO YOU?

05:18.919 --> 05:20.118
NONE OF THIS DOES.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.620
I'M ALSO GONNA BE
YOUR TEACHER NEXT YEAR.

05:21.621 --> 05:23.121
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
- NOW BACK TO OUR STORY.

05:24.058 --> 05:25.257
IT IS I,

05:25.259 --> 05:27.526
JOHN NOT QUINCY ADAMS.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.497
WAIT, WHY'D THEY NAME
THE SCHOOL AFTER THIS GUY?

05:32.499 --> 05:33.899
I MEAN, HE MUST
HAVE DONE SOMETHING.

05:33.901 --> 05:35.734
HE DID. HE DID SOMETHING,
WE'RE GONNA GET TO IT.

05:35.736 --> 05:38.003
SO, JOHN ADAMS,

05:38.005 --> 05:39.805
WHERE ARE YOUR REBEL FRIENDS?

05:39.807 --> 05:41.873
WITH ME AS ALWAYS.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.176
HARK!

05:44.178 --> 05:46.144
HERE'S ONE RIGHT NOW.

05:48.215 --> 05:50.716
LOOKING GOOD,
GEORGIE WASHINGTON.

05:50.718 --> 05:53.685
JOHN, YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME.

05:55.089 --> 05:57.022
GOOD!

05:57.024 --> 05:59.124
NOW, MAY I INTRODUCE,

05:59.126 --> 06:01.126
HE IS CRAZY SMART,

06:01.128 --> 06:02.794
HE'S ROCKING GRANNY GLASSES,

06:02.796 --> 06:05.030
THE OLD KITE FLYER HIMSELF,

06:05.032 --> 06:07.866
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.968
Maya:
I'M NOT DOING THIS.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.971
COME ON, WE CAN'T START
THE REVOLUTION WITHOUT YOU.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.706
FINE, BUT NOBODY LOOK AT ME.

06:14.708 --> 06:18.009
OKAY, NOBODY LOOK AT
MAYA!

06:24.051 --> 06:25.317
( classmates laughing )

06:25.319 --> 06:29.020
WHY, BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
CAN YOU FEEL

06:29.022 --> 06:30.889
THE ELECTRICITY BETWEEN US?

06:30.891 --> 06:32.090
HUH?

06:33.727 --> 06:35.827
WHEN DO WE GET RID
OF THIS GUY?

06:35.829 --> 06:36.828
RIGHT NOW!

06:36.830 --> 06:37.996
KING GEORGE,

06:37.998 --> 06:40.098
THE AMERICAN COLONIES
WANT THEIR FREEDOM.

06:40.100 --> 06:43.034
YOU BELONG TO ME,
AND I WILL NEVER LET YOU GO.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.453
IT'S THE KING'S LAW.

06:44.454 --> 06:45.871
YOU BELONG TO ME
UNTIL YOU'RE 18.

06:45.873 --> 06:46.938
IT'S THE LAW.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.874
WHATEVER YOU SAY,
KING GEORGE.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.308
STOP CALLING ME THAT.

06:50.310 --> 06:51.643
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

06:51.645 --> 06:52.677
POPS DOESN'T LIKE POPS' LESSON?

06:52.679 --> 06:53.812
YEAH.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.213
LISTEN GUYS,

06:55.215 --> 06:58.216
NOT EVERYTHING I TEACH YOU
IN CLASS APPLIES TO OUR LIVES.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.352
IT DOES, EVERY TIME, SIR.

07:00.354 --> 07:01.953
OKAY, GAME IS ALL SET UP.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.255
WE DOING THIS THING,
OR WHAT?

07:03.257 --> 07:04.956
- NO.
- YES.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.592
DO YOU GUYS EVEN KNOW
HOW TO PLAY THE FAMILY GAME?

07:07.594 --> 07:09.027
LET ME TEACH YOU.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.028
OKAY.

07:10.030 --> 07:10.962
BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS HERE,

07:10.964 --> 07:12.063
AND YOU CAN'T GET RID OF ME.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.181
ALWAYS WINS.

07:13.182 --> 07:14.298
ALWAYS EATS TOO MUCH POPCORN
AND SAYS,

07:14.301 --> 07:15.867
"I'M NEVER
EATING POPCORN AGAIN."

07:15.869 --> 07:17.936
( muffled )
BUT IT'S SO DELICIOUS.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.940
WOULD YOU BE
ON MY TEAM, UNCLE JOSH?

07:21.942 --> 07:23.074
TRY AND STOP ME.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.743
OKAY, I'LL STOP YOU.
YOU'RE ON MY TEAM.

07:24.745 --> 07:25.877
HE'S MY UNCLE.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.946
HE'S MY HUSBAND.

07:27.948 --> 07:31.049
CONGRATULATIONS.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.818
IT SAYS HERE THE GOAL
IS TO GET IN TO ONE OF

07:32.820 --> 07:34.286
THE FOUR SUCCESS SQUARES
WITH YOUR TEAMMATE.

07:34.288 --> 07:36.621
AND THEN YOU WIN.
IT MAKES THIS SOUND.

07:36.623 --> 07:37.756

07:37.758 --> 07:40.025
I WIN!  OH, IT
HASN'T HAPPENED YET.

07:40.027 --> 07:42.794
WHAT'S THE BIG CIRCLE
IN THE MIDDLE FOR?

07:42.796 --> 07:43.862
OH, WE DON'T GO THERE.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.063
IF EVEN ONE PERSON
GOES IN THERE,

07:45.065 --> 07:46.131
THEN YOU HAVE TO PLAY
THE LONG GAME.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.365
WHAT'S THE LONG GAME?

07:47.367 --> 07:48.366
I DON'T KNOW.
WE'VE NEVER PLAYED IT.

07:48.368 --> 07:49.234
INTRIGUING.
SHOULD WE FIND OUT?

07:49.236 --> 07:50.702
NO, IT TAKES FOREVER.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.003
AND YOU DON'T
GET TO HEAR THIS.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.805
- ( horn sounds )
- I WIN!

07:53.807 --> 07:55.807
OH, SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH ME.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.175
<i>( doorbell rings )</i>

07:57.177 --> 08:00.178
I WIN!
OH, MY GOODNESS.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.947
NOW WHO COULD THAT BE?

08:01.949 --> 08:04.282
HI, AUGGIE.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.717
HEY, YOU'RE PLAYING A GAME?

08:05.719 --> 08:07.118
CAN I BE ON YOUR TEAM?

08:11.191 --> 08:13.024
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN, PAL.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.694
MY WOMAN'S HERE.

08:15.696 --> 08:16.995

08:16.997 --> 08:19.164
BRING YOUR WOMAN IN.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.066
LET'S BRING IN EVERYBODY.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.334
WHY DON'T WE PUT UP SIGNS

08:22.336 --> 08:23.368
ON THE TELEPHONE POLES

08:23.370 --> 08:25.170

09:07.748 --> 09:10.015
YOU REPRESENT HOMEWORK
AND NO FUN,

09:10.017 --> 09:14.085
WHILE YOU ARE SO HANDSOME
IT KIND OF MAKES MY EYES HURT.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.187

09:38.912 --> 09:40.579
Josh: <i> OKAY.</i>

09:40.580 --> 09:42.247
THE OBJECT OF THIS GAME
IS TO CREATE A FAMILY,

09:42.249 --> 09:44.816
PROTECT IT, AND GET SAFELY
THROUGH A WORLD OF OBSTACLES

09:44.818 --> 09:46.985
THAT WILL TEST HOW STRONG
YOUR FAMILY IS.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.787
THE WINNER OF THE SHORT GAME

09:48.789 --> 09:50.755
IS THE FIRST TEAM TO END UP
IN ONE OF THE FOUR

09:50.757 --> 09:51.923

09:51.925 --> 09:53.291

09:55.963 --> 10:00.298

OKAY.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.033
UM, MAYA AND I UP FIRST.
WE'LL GO FIRST.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.369
OH, SAYS WHO?

10:04.371 --> 10:06.304
SAYS THE KING OF THE CASTLE.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.872
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE
THE KING,

10:07.874 --> 10:09.240
DOESN'T MEAN YOU GET
TO MAKE ALL OF THE RULES.

10:09.242 --> 10:10.976
OH, YEAH?

10:10.978 --> 10:12.510
THAT'S ACTUALLY THE FIRST RULE
IN THE KING'S HANDBOOK.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.914
WELL, IT'S BEEN
A LOVELY EVENING.

10:15.916 --> 10:19.184
AND NOW I NEED A HUG
FROM MY MAMA.

10:19.186 --> 10:20.185
MAMA?

10:20.187 --> 10:21.920
YEAH.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.088
WHAT DO YOU CALL YOUR MAMA?

10:23.090 --> 10:24.923
MA.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.191
TRY IT OUT.

10:26.193 --> 10:29.094
MA.

10:29.096 --> 10:30.996
NAH, SHE'D PUT ME
IN THE SHED.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.332
YOU KNOW WHAT,

10:34.334 --> 10:36.167
DAD, YOU MAY
BE THE KING,

10:36.169 --> 10:39.104
BUT I AM GOING FIRST.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.239
( gasps )

10:41.241 --> 10:42.941
( gasps )
YOU ARE STAGING AN ACT

10:42.943 --> 10:44.342
OF OPEN REBELLION
AGAINST YOUR KING.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.945
YOU HAVE LEFT THE COLONIES
NO CHOICE BUT TO BREAK AWAY

10:46.947 --> 10:48.513
FROM YOU AND BECOME INDEPENDENT.

10:48.515 --> 10:50.281
BECAUSE YOU'RE FIGHTING
FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR FAMILIES.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.583
AND FRIENDS.

10:51.584 --> 10:52.884
AND FAMILY IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.186
AND FRIENDS.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.487
RILEY, YOU DON'T THINK
FAMILY SHOULD COME FIRST?

10:55.489 --> 10:57.922
I CANNOT
DO THIS RIGHT NOW.

10:57.924 --> 11:00.025
I AM IN THE MIDDLE
OF A REBELLION.

11:00.027 --> 11:01.559
OH, YEAH.

11:01.561 --> 11:03.028
OH, YEAH.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.195
LET'S SEE HOW
YOUR LITTLE REBELLION

11:04.197 --> 11:06.498
FARES AGAINST THE MIGHT
OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.105
WHOA, FARKLE.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.173
WHERE'D YOU GET THE CANNON?

11:15.175 --> 11:17.075
FROM MY CANNON GUY.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.944
YES, GENERAL WASHINGTON.

11:19.946 --> 11:21.212
YOU REALLY HAVE TO WONDER

11:21.214 --> 11:22.881
IF THE KING
WASN'T SO STUBBORN,

11:22.883 --> 11:24.249
COULD SOMETHING
HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT

11:24.250 --> 11:25.616
SO AMERICA WOULD STILL BE
IN THE BRITISH FAMILY?

11:25.619 --> 11:28.153
A NATION OR A FAMILY,

11:28.155 --> 11:30.355
CAN ONLY REMAIN UNITED

11:30.357 --> 11:32.924
IF IT'S LEADERS GOVERN FAIRLY

11:32.926 --> 11:35.393
AND ADDRESS THE NEEDS
OF ALL OF ITS MEMBERS

11:35.395 --> 11:37.128
BOTH OLD AND YOUNG.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.064
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.066
SO LET'S GET THIS PARTY STARTED.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.001
IS THIS THING LOADED?

11:43.003 --> 11:44.069
IT IS NOW.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.937
HAPPY FOURTH OF JULY,
EVERYBODY.

11:45.939 --> 11:48.406
MAYA, THE WAR HASN'T
EVEN STARTED YET.

11:48.408 --> 11:49.541
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE BOSTON.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.943
Farkle:
<i>WHEN AM I GOING TO BOSTON?</i>

11:51.945 --> 11:52.977
IN FIVE...

11:52.979 --> 11:55.013

11:57.517 --> 11:59.884

THE FATHERHOOD PATH.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.619
BING, BING, BING, BING.

12:01.621 --> 12:03.888
AND THE PINK SQUARE MEANS...

12:21.241 --> 12:22.640
ACCORDING TO THE GAME,

12:22.642 --> 12:23.942

12:26.246 --> 12:27.545
JOSH!

12:27.547 --> 12:30.081

12:58.945 --> 13:00.645
I'M GOING TO ALLOW IT.

13:00.647 --> 13:01.780

13:01.782 --> 13:03.248
BECAUSE SHE CRACKS ME UP.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.017

15:33.800 --> 15:35.166
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

15:35.168 --> 15:36.567
YOU'RE DESTROYING
YOUR PARENTS.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.403
THAT'S THE OBJECT
OF THE GAME.

15:39.372 --> 15:40.872
( sighs )
OH, COME ON, MAYA.

15:40.874 --> 15:42.407
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE
ACTUALLY GOING BACKPACKING

15:42.409 --> 15:44.543
THROUGH EUROPE.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.678
WE SHOULD DEFINITELY GO
BACKPACKING THROUGH EUROPE.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.246
AND WE'LL BRING
LUCAS AND FARKLE TO EUROPE.

15:48.248 --> 15:49.814
YEAH, AND WE'LL BRING
YOUR PARENTS.

15:49.816 --> 15:52.750
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO BRING MY PARENTS?

15:52.752 --> 15:53.785
OH.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.720
I GET IT.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.122
THIS ISN'T A GAME
TO THEM AT ALL, IS IT?

15:58.124 --> 15:59.424
NO, IT ISN'T.

15:59.426 --> 16:01.292
THEN HOW DO WE
POSSIBLY WIN?

16:01.294 --> 16:02.827
YOU DON'T WIN.

16:02.829 --> 16:05.129
YOU JUST PLAY WITH THEM, RILEY.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.197
IT'S GAME NIGHT.

16:06.199 --> 16:07.632
THEIR FAVORITE NIGHT
OF THE MONTH.

16:08.802 --> 16:11.469
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU GET MORE TIME
WITH THEM.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.238
SHE'S 12, AND SHE'S GONNA
BE GONE IN A BLINK.

16:14.240 --> 16:17.608
HE'S FIVE, AND ALREADY
BEEN MARRIED FOR 20 YEARS.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.350
HE GETS THAT FROM ME.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.919
LISTEN TOPANGA.

16:27.921 --> 16:30.154
WE'VE BEEN A TEAM
ALL OUR LIVES,

16:30.156 --> 16:32.590
SO NOW WE'RE A TEAM
IN THIS GAME.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.192
THAT'S NOT SO BAD,
IS IT?

16:34.194 --> 16:37.228
YOU JUST GET
SO MUCH OF HER

16:37.230 --> 16:38.629
AND YOU DO
SUCH A GREAT JOB

16:38.631 --> 16:41.599
TEACHING HER, SHE'S
SO MUCH LIKE YOU.

16:41.601 --> 16:44.836
I JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT I'VE
MADE AN IMPRESSION ON HER.

16:44.838 --> 16:47.171
EVERY PARENT I KNOW
WHO HAS KIDS THIS AGE

16:47.173 --> 16:50.241
TELLS ME THIS IS WHEN
THEY HEAD TOWARDS
THEIR FRIENDS.

16:51.378 --> 16:53.911
BUT EVENTUALLY, THEY MAKE
THEIR WAY BACK.

16:57.917 --> 16:58.950
OH, LOOK AT THAT.

16:58.952 --> 17:00.918
THEY'RE ALREADY BACK.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.654
BREAK'S OVER.
GAME ON!

17:03.656 --> 17:06.891
GAME OVER.
GOD BLESS AMERICA.

17:06.893 --> 17:09.327
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?

17:09.329 --> 17:11.662
MY KINGDOM.

17:11.664 --> 17:13.297
I HAVE NOTHING LEFT.

17:14.501 --> 17:16.901
ACTUALLY, YOU STILL HAVE
INDIA, IRELAND, AUSTRALIA,

17:16.903 --> 17:19.203
SHAKESPEARE, DICKENS,
AND THE BEATLES.

17:19.205 --> 17:20.271
OH, YEAH.

17:20.273 --> 17:21.806
WHO NEEDS YOU ANYWAY?

17:21.808 --> 17:23.641
YOU KNOW YOU DO.

17:23.643 --> 17:26.978
THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR

17:26.980 --> 17:28.880
ENDED IN 1783

17:28.882 --> 17:30.415
LEAVING A RIFT

17:30.417 --> 17:32.717
BETWEEN ENGLAND
AND THE UNITED STATES.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.485
BUT WE LOVE EACH OTHER
NOW, THOUGH, RIGHT?

17:34.487 --> 17:37.555
WE DO, BUT IT TOOK SOME TIME.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.956
IN FACT, IT WASN'T UNTIL

17:38.958 --> 17:41.826
1814, WHEN ANOTHER AMERICAN

17:41.828 --> 17:45.063
HELPED MEND
THAT RELATIONSHIP.

17:45.064 --> 17:48.299
HIS NAME, RILEY,
WAS JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.

17:48.301 --> 17:50.468
OH.

17:50.470 --> 17:51.903
THAT'S WHAT THE KID DID.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.004
Cory:
<i>THAT'S RIGHT.</i>

17:53.006 --> 17:54.572
SEE, IT TOOK
THE NEXT GENERATION

17:54.574 --> 17:56.374
TO BRING
EVERYBODY TOGETHER.

17:56.376 --> 17:57.942
SO PEOPLE THAT GO
TO WAR

17:57.944 --> 17:59.510
CAN ACTUALLY
BECOME FRIENDS?

17:59.512 --> 18:03.514
REVOLUTION IS
A SHORT MOMENT IN TIME.

18:03.516 --> 18:06.317
BUT IF YOU PLAY
THE LONG GAME CORRECTLY,

18:06.319 --> 18:09.754
EVERYBODY CAN END UP JUST
WHERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE.

18:13.893 --> 18:14.959
SOMEONE HAS TO GET A 12.

18:14.961 --> 18:16.327
ANYTHING BUT A 12.

18:16.329 --> 18:17.895
NOBODY THROW A 12.

18:17.897 --> 18:18.963
12!

18:18.965 --> 18:20.565
OH, THANK GOODNESS.
IT'S OVER.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.333
NO, IT'S NOT.

18:22.335 --> 18:25.369
I'M NOT GOING
FOR THE SUCCESS SQUARE.

18:25.371 --> 18:27.472
I'M GOING FOR
THE CIRCLE IN THE MIDDLE.

18:27.474 --> 18:30.007
WE ARE GOING TO PLAY
THE LONG GAME.

18:30.009 --> 18:31.576
- WHAT?
- YOU COULD WIN.

18:31.578 --> 18:32.977
DUDE, WHY WOULD
YOU DO THAT?

18:34.848 --> 18:38.783
BECAUSE TONIGHT THE FAMILY GAME
IS NOT ABOUT WINNING.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.719
UH, SAY WHAT?

18:43.490 --> 18:45.490
MOM, I WAS ONLY
TRYING TO BEAT YOU

18:45.492 --> 18:46.858
BECAUSE I WANT YOU
TO BE PROUD OF ME.

18:46.860 --> 18:48.493
YOU DO?

18:48.495 --> 18:50.561
YEAH, I WANT
TO BE LIKE YOU.

18:50.563 --> 18:51.896
YOU DO?

18:51.898 --> 18:54.832
A KILLER SHARK
WHO ALWAYS WINS?

18:54.834 --> 18:58.503
THAT IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING
I HAVE EVER HEARD.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.005
SO TONIGHT,

19:01.007 --> 19:02.440
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS

19:02.442 --> 19:03.808
WHEN YOU PLAY THE LONG GAME.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.811
I'M NEVER GONNA SEE
MY MAMA AGAIN.

19:06.813 --> 19:09.580
I WANTED SOMEONE TO LAND
ON THE SUCCESS SQUARE.

19:09.582 --> 19:10.882
I KIND OF WANTED TO HEAR

19:10.884 --> 19:11.883
( horn sounds )

19:11.885 --> 19:13.951
I WIN!
SERIOUSLY, HELP ME.

19:15.088 --> 19:17.388
IN THE LONG GAME,
THE PLAYERS ALL PLAY TOGETHER

19:17.390 --> 19:18.789
TO CONQUER THE GAME ITSELF.

19:18.791 --> 19:21.459
SO WE'RE ALL ON
ONE BIG TEAM THEN?

19:22.362 --> 19:23.895
IF YOU'LL LET US BE.

19:23.897 --> 19:26.964
AND DAD, I PROMISE THAT
NOBODY IS GOING ANYWHERE.

19:26.966 --> 19:29.167
WELL, RILEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:29.168 --> 19:31.369
IF THESE ARE THE PEOPLE YOU'VE
CHOSEN TO LEAVE US FOR SOMEDAY,

19:32.472 --> 19:35.806
THEY'RE WELCOME TO PLAY
WITH US ANYTIME.

19:35.808 --> 19:38.009
YOU'VE MADE
SOME WONDERFUL CHOICES.

19:38.011 --> 19:40.378
YOU'RE GONNA BUY
THE FRIENDS GAME?

19:40.380 --> 19:41.646
YEAH.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.948
CAN WE PLAY THAT ONE
WITH YOU GUYS?

19:43.950 --> 19:45.650
ANYTIME YOU WANT.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.419
YOU'RE A GOOD KING.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.955
YOU'RE A GOOD
JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.

19:50.957 --> 19:54.058
OH, THE KID WHO BROUGHT
EVERYONE TOGETHER.

19:54.060 --> 19:55.393
YEAH.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.061
TOLD YOU.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.832
( horn sounds )

20:01.834 --> 20:02.900
WHO'S JOINING US?

20:02.902 --> 20:04.969
WE ARE.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.410
WELL, BIRDS ARE CHIRPING.

20:12.412 --> 20:15.546
SOUNDS OF A SLEEPY CITY
COMING TO LIFE AS THE SUN

20:15.548 --> 20:18.416
PEEKS ITS SMILING FACE...

20:18.418 --> 20:19.884
YEAH, OKAY.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.953
...UPON 8 TIRED GAME PLAYERS.

20:21.955 --> 20:24.855
AND IF AUGGIE MATTHEWS
CAN ROLL A TWO,

20:24.857 --> 20:26.857
THEN WE WILL FINALLY
FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS

20:26.859 --> 20:29.393
WHEN YOU WIN
THE LONG GAME.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.962
NOBODY CAN ROLL A TWO.

20:30.964 --> 20:32.930
WE PICK TWO.

20:32.932 --> 20:34.799
YOU KNOW WHAT, AVA?

20:34.801 --> 20:36.033
I FINALLY LIKE YOU.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.101
OKAY.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.973
( game chimes )

20:41.975 --> 20:43.674
THAT'S IT?

20:43.676 --> 20:45.042
( game chimes )

20:45.044 --> 20:46.911
<i>( game whirs )</i>

20:46.913 --> 20:49.046
HOLD ON.

20:49.048 --> 20:51.115
<i>( mystical music plays )</i>

21:11.204 --> 21:13.004
AND AS EVERYONE
IS JOINED TOGETHER,

21:13.006 --> 21:15.973
WE SEE THAT IN THE LONG GAME,

21:15.975 --> 21:18.009
FRIENDS BECOME FAMILY.

21:18.011 --> 21:20.144
IT'S NOT A GAME AT ALL.

21:20.146 --> 21:21.846
WHAT IS IT, MOMMY?

21:21.848 --> 21:23.014
IT'S LIFE.

21:23.016 --> 21:25.049
LIFE IS THE LONG GAME?

21:25.051 --> 21:26.217
YEAH, BUBBA.

21:26.219 --> 21:29.086
LIFE IS THE LONG GAME.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.154
MAYA.

21:33.026 --> 21:34.959
YOU DO UNDERSTAND
I'M TOO OLD FOR YOU?

21:34.961 --> 21:35.860
I DO, JOSH.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.595
I KNOW THAT.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.030
GOOD.

21:39.032 --> 21:41.098
BUT I'M IN IT
FOR THE LONG GAME.

21:45.004 --> 21:49.073
YEAH, ME TOO.

21:57.550 --> 21:59.850
<i>( school bell rings )</i>

21:59.852 --> 22:01.719
I'M GLAD WE'RE
ALL FRIENDS AGAIN.

22:01.721 --> 22:03.688
YEAH, I'M GLAD I CAN
TAKE THIS OFF.

22:03.690 --> 22:05.222
IT'S AMAZING THAT PEOPLE
SO CLOSE CAN GO TO WAR.

22:05.224 --> 22:06.791
TAKE OFF YOUR CROWN.

22:06.793 --> 22:07.925
NO.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.026
LUCKILY, IT'S ALL HISTORY

22:09.028 --> 22:10.161
AND NOT OUR REAL LIVES.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.996
HEY.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.964

FAMILY GAME NIGHT TONIGHT.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.567

22:16.569 --> 22:17.802
TAKE OFF YOUR CROWN.

22:17.804 --> 22:18.836

22:18.838 --> 22:19.854
I'D LOVE THAT, THANK YOU.

22:19.855 --> 22:20.871
SO YOU'RE NEVER
GOING TO TAKE OFF YOUR CROWN?

22:20.873 --> 22:21.939
NO.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.943
DON'T YOU THINK
YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR DAD?

22:27.647 --> 22:28.913
NAH.

22:28.915 --> 22:31.248
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG?
