WEBVTT

03:56.423 --> 03:56.924
Shit.

06:24.984 --> 06:26.552
Hey, is that you?

06:34.862 --> 06:35.763
You decent?

06:36.163 --> 06:37.031
Never.

06:41.602 --> 06:42.637
Oh thank you.

06:46.241 --> 06:49.177
You still up for Blake's place
tonight, chick?

06:49.711 --> 06:52.513
Ok if I use your shower, Jill,
Stace?

06:53.849 --> 06:54.850
Mi casa...

06:56.085 --> 06:57.519
You joining us?

07:01.257 --> 07:04.660
Give me one hour and I'll be
good to go.

07:05.929 --> 07:08.732
I'll give you two, I know what
you're like.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.648
Oh where is she?

07:32.558 --> 07:33.692
So night...

07:33.726 --> 07:34.626
Evening ladies...

07:35.060 --> 07:36.695
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Hello, Jimmy.

07:36.729 --> 07:38.230
How are you?

07:38.263 --> 07:40.032
Yea, I'm really good thanks. So
are you guys here to see Blake?

07:40.733 --> 07:41.668
We are.

07:41.701 --> 07:43.036
Alright,
she's just out the back.

07:43.069 --> 07:44.070
Thank you!

07:46.072 --> 07:48.108
I would love for you to do my
makeup.

07:48.141 --> 07:49.809
Something to try.

07:52.178 --> 07:52.812
Hey!

07:53.981 --> 07:55.583
- Hey!
- Hey, gorgeous.

07:56.150 --> 07:58.853
So... Trish was in here earlier.

08:02.056 --> 08:05.126
What the hell does that cheating
bitch want?

08:05.159 --> 08:07.963
She just asked when I was seeing
you again.

08:09.965 --> 08:12.100
I said you would be here
tonight.

08:13.201 --> 08:15.137
I don't know what she wants and

08:15.170 --> 08:17.205
if you want her gone,
she's gone.

08:17.974 --> 08:20.276
You can't seriously want to see
her.

08:22.178 --> 08:23.179
I don't know.

08:34.958 --> 08:36.760
Look what Satan dragged in.

08:44.669 --> 08:47.272
I'm just gonna hear what she has
to say.

08:59.785 --> 09:01.053
It's just a hug.

09:01.353 --> 09:03.055
It's never just a hug.

09:08.361 --> 09:10.697
Blake said you wanted to see me.

09:11.264 --> 09:13.867
I wanted to see how you were
holding up.

09:15.168 --> 09:15.836
Tyler.

09:16.403 --> 09:17.939
He got out earlier.

09:18.372 --> 09:19.006
What?

09:20.174 --> 09:22.376
I'm so sorry, I thought you
knew.

09:22.410 --> 09:24.745
Is this one of your wind-ups,
Trish?

09:24.779 --> 09:26.314
What? No.

09:27.148 --> 09:29.751
It's been all over the news
today.

09:34.123 --> 09:35.791
The solicitor's letter.

09:41.731 --> 09:43.867
What the hell is he doing here?

09:43.900 --> 09:45.068
Whoa there chick.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.906
Let's get this man a freebie on
me, shall we?

09:52.275 --> 09:55.146
Why don't you guys help Kay back
to her seat?

10:00.417 --> 10:02.953
I'm gonna need another martini
for Trish.

10:02.987 --> 10:04.855
What was that about?

10:04.889 --> 10:05.724
Tyler's free.

10:06.491 --> 10:09.094
The guy that got banged up for
assaulting her?

10:09.595 --> 10:11.930
He put her in a fucking coma,
Jimmy.

10:14.099 --> 10:15.066
You ok?

10:16.401 --> 10:19.872
I'm fine, everyone needs to ask
if I'm ok. Ok?

10:21.774 --> 10:24.310
Just let's get away from this
bullshit.

10:28.281 --> 10:31.151
Who's up for getting the band
back together?

10:32.920 --> 10:33.787
What?

10:35.088 --> 10:38.158
We haven't gotten bank
account emptying, random

10:38.192 --> 10:41.261
tattoo getting,
memory losing silly in years.

10:41.696 --> 10:45.166
It's about time we did, so who's
with me?

10:46.367 --> 10:48.069
Well aren't you working this
weekend?

10:48.102 --> 10:52.006
Well fuck work! I haven't had a
sick day in five years.

10:53.308 --> 10:54.777
It's about time I did.

11:02.117 --> 11:02.818
I'm in.

11:04.253 --> 11:04.920
Trish?

11:06.456 --> 11:08.858
What you actually want me to
come?

11:09.292 --> 11:11.995
Well aside from you
breaking my heart we all

11:12.028 --> 11:14.531
used to have a pretty
good time didn't we?

11:14.565 --> 11:16.533
It would be like Brighton and
Aelfricam.

11:16.567 --> 11:19.370
I thought we weren't supposed to
mention Aelfricam.

11:20.004 --> 11:23.074
That was the one with the
picture, wasn't it?

11:27.044 --> 11:29.280
Kay, you sure you want to do
this?

11:29.313 --> 11:30.115
I miss us.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.218
You wanna know if I'll be ok,
I'll be ok

11:33.252 --> 11:35.254
when we're getting
silly again together.

11:36.221 --> 11:36.922
Ladies.

11:41.093 --> 11:43.963
Here's to the women
in the stiletto shoes who

11:43.997 --> 11:46.799
make all the money
and drink all the booze.

11:47.533 --> 11:48.167
Cheers.

12:02.116 --> 12:03.884
- Ahh!
- Ahh, yes!

12:03.917 --> 12:04.551
Yes!

12:06.154 --> 12:07.822
- Yo bitches.
- Yea!

12:11.393 --> 12:12.927
- Hi, there.
- Take that for you.

12:12.961 --> 12:13.561
Thank you.

12:22.639 --> 12:25.308
I can't still believe you've got
Sunny D!

12:26.610 --> 12:28.911
Only man in my life who hasn't
let me down.

12:28.944 --> 12:29.846
Ok!

12:32.215 --> 12:33.250
Who's ready for a

12:33.283 --> 12:34.885
weekend they'll never forget?

12:34.918 --> 12:35.352
Yea!

13:22.036 --> 13:24.071
Bollocks...
hey open the glove box

13:24.105 --> 13:25.940
and pass me the map book, will
you?

13:25.973 --> 13:27.208
The map book?

13:27.241 --> 13:29.143
Well unless you've
got a working satellite

13:29.176 --> 13:30.979
we're about to
kick it old school.

13:31.313 --> 13:31.947
Blake?

13:33.315 --> 13:34.549
For emergencies!

13:34.584 --> 13:38.153
Pretty sure that's for like on
board a boat emergency honey,

13:38.186 --> 13:41.424
not you know stranded on
the side of the M4 emergency.

14:15.093 --> 14:16.595
Oh Blake, stop for him.

14:18.230 --> 14:19.465
Are you feeling alright?

14:19.498 --> 14:21.233
Strange dude thumbing
in the middle of the

14:21.267 --> 14:23.402
nowhere and you of all
people wanna pick him up.

14:23.436 --> 14:25.371
There's four of us and besides,
remember when

14:25.404 --> 14:27.540
those guys stopped for
us on the way to Glasgow?

14:29.710 --> 14:32.045
What's the worst that can
happen?

14:43.391 --> 14:45.226
Oh you're a life saver.

14:59.341 --> 15:00.643
Hi, I'm Kayla...

15:02.444 --> 15:04.781
This is Blake, that's Stacey and
Trish.

15:04.814 --> 15:07.383
Hi, Vinnie, nice to meet you
all.

15:12.455 --> 15:14.457
You guys heading to the
festival, Mabon?

15:14.491 --> 15:16.092
What?

15:16.125 --> 15:17.596
I just assumed that's where
you guys are going because

15:17.629 --> 15:19.731
there's a whole lot of nothing
in every other direction.

15:19.764 --> 15:21.532
Well we're staying
at the Mabon Lodge,

15:21.565 --> 15:23.167
does that have
something to do with it?

15:23.200 --> 15:25.469
Yes, it's their festival.
It's this

15:25.503 --> 15:27.772
yearly pagan dancing thing where

15:27.806 --> 15:30.041
they... give offerings of wheat

15:30.075 --> 15:32.344
and wine to their pagan god,
Mabon

15:32.377 --> 15:33.411
Sounds a bit weird to me.

15:33.746 --> 15:35.648
It is a bit weird, they paint

15:35.681 --> 15:38.517
themselves and dance
around half naked

15:38.550 --> 15:40.753
but...
they have the best weed and

15:40.786 --> 15:43.322
hoochie you've ever tried.
Trust me.

15:43.690 --> 15:45.491
Well they're my kind of party!

15:47.226 --> 15:48.762
Mabon Lodge is a
stone's throw away,

15:48.795 --> 15:49.830
I can show you guys if you like.

15:49.863 --> 15:52.465
We're not a bit of girly,
I'm sure we can be able

15:52.498 --> 15:54.636
to find it ourselves if
we want to go, thanks.

16:16.825 --> 16:20.797
Well thanks for the lift.
Hopefully see you guys later.

17:27.368 --> 17:28.402
Nice antlers.

17:39.347 --> 17:41.450
There was supposed to be someone

17:41.484 --> 17:43.854
waiting with a front
door key for us?

17:55.933 --> 17:58.168
How do we get through the gate?

18:02.439 --> 18:03.273
Thanks.

18:03.741 --> 18:04.541
Good chat.

18:34.675 --> 18:35.843
He was a creepie.

19:06.043 --> 19:07.845
I'm not getting any signal.

19:13.316 --> 19:14.818
I've got yours Blake.

19:17.856 --> 19:20.557
I've got some signal barely.

19:22.627 --> 19:26.330
Please tell me there's wifi. I
have to have wifi.

19:26.698 --> 19:30.301
I don't care about wifi, cause
look, there's a pool.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.809
I'll be in in a minute.

20:06.141 --> 20:09.377
Yep. kitchen's in there so your
bedroom's up stairs.

20:31.568 --> 20:33.403
There's only three bedrooms.
So...

20:34.138 --> 20:35.806
two of us have to share.

20:36.439 --> 20:38.843
Looks like that's the master as
well.

20:39.143 --> 20:42.113
Blake and I will share. She
doesn't snore like you do.

20:42.814 --> 20:44.616
Ok, that works.

21:16.482 --> 21:17.118
Hey...

21:17.752 --> 21:18.385
Look...

21:19.988 --> 21:22.489
I don't know what your game
is...

21:23.825 --> 21:26.761
Kay doesn't need any of your
shit this weekend.

21:27.561 --> 21:30.199
I get it...
you're her oldest friend

21:30.232 --> 21:32.968
but...
but I just wanna make her happy.

21:33.769 --> 21:34.670
As friends.

21:36.105 --> 21:37.605
And if after the
weekend she doesn't

21:37.640 --> 21:39.141
want anything more
to do with me then...

21:41.177 --> 21:43.479
then you'll never see me again.

21:44.915 --> 21:46.116
Yea, we'll see.

22:21.854 --> 22:24.523
Well hey babe,
stop that it's supposed

22:24.556 --> 22:26.525
to be a fun weekend, remember?

22:27.894 --> 22:28.896
Tea or coffee?

22:28.929 --> 22:30.563
You know I'm a coffee person.

22:30.898 --> 22:31.531
Stace?

22:32.232 --> 22:33.233
Tea for me.

22:33.267 --> 22:34.034
Where's Blake?

22:35.235 --> 22:36.502
Ooh, never mind.

22:39.239 --> 22:40.674
What is she doing?

22:41.276 --> 22:41.943
See her.

22:42.210 --> 22:43.912
You guys are useless.

22:44.212 --> 22:45.246
Come with me.

22:49.550 --> 22:50.919
Come on!

22:54.724 --> 22:55.992
This way.

23:10.707 --> 23:11.942
What are we doing?

23:13.343 --> 23:14.510
Wait for it.

23:25.023 --> 23:27.291
Blake, I'm not sure we're
supposed to be in here.

23:27.325 --> 23:30.629
Maybe this was the stuff Vinnie
was talking about.

23:36.902 --> 23:37.568
Blake!

23:38.804 --> 23:39.838
I don't think anyone's
going to miss it. They

23:39.872 --> 23:41.841
would lock the door if
they were that concerned.

23:42.142 --> 23:44.543
For once I'm in agreement with
Trish.

23:48.048 --> 23:52.584
Look, if anyone catches us we'll
just pay for it. How is that?

23:53.854 --> 23:55.122
Oh fine, ok.

24:47.946 --> 24:50.081
Who took that photo of us naked?

24:50.815 --> 24:51.282
Me.

24:54.253 --> 24:56.088
I've actually still got the
camera.

24:56.122 --> 24:57.123
Whoa!

24:58.424 --> 24:59.258
Group photo?

24:59.291 --> 25:00.192
Yes!

25:00.759 --> 25:01.227
Yes.

25:02.828 --> 25:05.799
Why can't you take a picture
on a phone like a normal

25:05.832 --> 25:08.802
person? You know you
got your phone right there.

25:08.835 --> 25:10.971
Alright, 3, 2, 1.

25:11.404 --> 25:12.806
Martha!

25:45.875 --> 25:47.443
Oh it's cute!

25:47.477 --> 25:48.444
Oh it's really nice.

25:48.478 --> 25:50.747
Maybe just keep it to yourself.

25:52.248 --> 25:53.417
I vote something new.

25:53.450 --> 25:54.084
Yea.

25:55.753 --> 25:56.387
Oh it's cute!

25:56.420 --> 25:58.789
Let me see. Oh it's lovely.

25:58.822 --> 25:59.790
Ohh.

25:59.823 --> 26:01.125
Alright, we need a refill.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.161
What the fuck, dude!

26:04.829 --> 26:07.032
You scared the holy shit outta
me.

26:10.869 --> 26:12.370
What are you doing here?

26:12.971 --> 26:15.173
Just on my way
to the festival...

26:15.207 --> 26:17.443
thought you guys
might like to come.

26:20.780 --> 26:21.814
Could be fun.

26:23.182 --> 26:25.284
Why don't we guys party
together?

26:26.485 --> 26:28.321
Wouldn't you rather just chill
here?

26:28.354 --> 26:30.457
We've got all weekend for that,
I wanna dance.

26:30.958 --> 26:32.893
Well I'm up for it.

26:33.961 --> 26:35.295
Alright.

26:35.329 --> 26:37.764
I promise you'll remember it for
the rest of your lives.

27:06.830 --> 27:09.866
If I bust my heels Vinnie,
you're paying for them.

27:09.899 --> 27:11.334
Pick your face up.

27:27.184 --> 27:28.152
What's this.

27:28.386 --> 27:31.056
Didn't I say? Didn't I say?

28:33.290 --> 28:38.395
Tonight we celebrate our
offering to the goddess Mabon.

28:50.475 --> 28:56.882
Let her take our fears... and
reward us with her blessing.

28:57.950 --> 28:59.418
For the coming seasons.

29:13.166 --> 29:14.434
Goddess Mabon...

29:14.934 --> 29:16.904
as is your tradition...

29:17.505 --> 29:19.006
as is the way...

29:20.241 --> 29:22.042
We afford you our offerings...

29:23.277 --> 29:25.246
so you may remove our fears...

29:26.748 --> 29:28.950
till the next solstice.

29:35.357 --> 29:36.124
Accept...

29:37.225 --> 29:38.193
with respect.

29:39.528 --> 29:40.262
and duty.

29:42.031 --> 29:43.399
When do we get to party?

29:44.701 --> 29:45.501
Very soon.

30:05.724 --> 30:07.225
Mark down your fear.

30:26.512 --> 30:28.214
It's just a bit of fun.

30:43.564 --> 30:44.398
Done.

30:50.806 --> 30:51.673
Who's next?

30:58.247 --> 30:59.682
And where's the hooch and the
weed?

30:59.716 --> 31:01.083
All in good time.

31:16.801 --> 31:19.203
Ah what, what the fuck dude.

31:19.704 --> 31:21.105
Yea, that bit always gets me.

31:21.973 --> 31:24.375
Don't worry we don't have to do
that.

32:17.166 --> 32:19.535
Now this is my favorite bit.

32:24.708 --> 32:26.710
That's what I'm talking about.

32:33.216 --> 32:33.851
Jesus.

32:34.551 --> 32:35.251
Potent?

32:35.786 --> 32:37.487
It's got a bit of a kick.

32:46.397 --> 32:47.799
Thank you very much.

33:16.263 --> 33:16.698
Music!

33:32.848 --> 33:33.548
Come on.

33:36.551 --> 33:37.585
Don't be shy.

33:45.862 --> 33:47.396
What are you doing?

33:51.400 --> 33:52.937
Let them roam baby.

33:55.973 --> 33:59.242
Dance like every bodies watchin!

34:14.325 --> 34:15.928
Stop, leave now.

34:16.562 --> 34:17.396
Why?

34:18.998 --> 34:20.934
Before the end of the ritual.

34:22.401 --> 34:25.404
You and your friends,
you must go.

34:26.873 --> 34:27.774
Mrs. March.

34:29.409 --> 34:32.680
You should leave our guests...
to enjoy the festivities.

34:40.588 --> 34:41.522
Yes, Father.

34:48.429 --> 34:49.931
A little less handsey, eh?

34:52.000 --> 34:54.336
Mrs. March is
shall we say one of

34:54.369 --> 34:56.538
are more challenging
parishioners.

34:58.808 --> 35:00.777
Please, enjoy yourselves.

35:02.845 --> 35:07.283
This is an evening of
celebration, now you're here.

35:09.820 --> 35:12.421
Come on you two,
let's no leave you out.

35:14.657 --> 35:15.324
Come on.

37:30.940 --> 37:31.606
No.

37:32.041 --> 37:32.708
Oh!

37:35.177 --> 37:36.444
So you say.

37:38.080 --> 37:39.514
We made it.

37:42.786 --> 37:44.653
Hurry... I'm so...

37:46.122 --> 37:46.990
Is it a biscuit?

37:47.023 --> 37:48.490
It is a biscuit.

37:53.596 --> 37:55.032
Oh that's no fair.

37:55.598 --> 37:59.103
Actually, you guys I'm gonna go
for a quick dip.

37:59.569 --> 38:01.571
Anyone finds you joining me.

38:01.906 --> 38:03.874
You don't have your swimsuit.

38:04.209 --> 38:05.844
Who needs a swimsuit?

38:05.877 --> 38:06.945
You're crazy.

38:07.913 --> 38:09.214
It'll be lovely.

38:10.648 --> 38:12.751
Don't be long and catch your
death. Alright?

38:13.617 --> 38:14.052
Bye.

40:06.975 --> 40:07.843
Peak a boo.

40:23.126 --> 40:24.293
I found you.

40:27.296 --> 40:28.832
How was the rabbit?

40:29.399 --> 40:30.901
Did you miss me?

40:39.343 --> 40:40.845
No where to run!

40:41.813 --> 40:42.981
It's time to die.

40:45.049 --> 40:46.050
Hello little rabbit.

40:48.620 --> 40:49.721
Oh it's me.

40:50.255 --> 40:51.824
Me, it's me.

40:55.161 --> 40:56.262
Where's Tyler?

40:58.464 --> 40:59.732
It's just a dream.

41:00.799 --> 41:01.800
You're alright.

41:39.208 --> 41:41.277
You get a good look, fucking
pervs.

42:11.509 --> 42:14.980
Blake, Blake. Blake, Blake!

42:16.015 --> 42:16.849
Blake!

42:18.017 --> 42:20.219
Blake, Blake, Blake, what's
happened?

42:20.253 --> 42:21.887
There was huge dog.

42:24.290 --> 42:27.226
No, no, no, no. There's no dog,
there's no dog.

42:27.260 --> 42:28.528
Blake.

42:28.562 --> 42:30.464
- It was right there.
- Look at me. Look at me.

42:30.497 --> 42:32.766
I promise you, I promise you.

42:33.200 --> 42:35.535
There's no dog, there's no dog.

42:35.569 --> 42:38.005
Ok? Come on, let's get you out.

42:40.108 --> 42:42.477
Come on, come on, look, come on.

42:42.510 --> 42:44.545
You're ok, let's get you out.

42:44.579 --> 42:46.381
You're alright, let's get you
inside.

43:53.454 --> 43:54.655
Morning babe.

43:54.688 --> 43:55.322
Morning!

43:56.590 --> 43:59.593
Hi, Stace, woke up and she
wasn't there.

44:00.060 --> 44:01.895
She slept with me.

44:01.929 --> 44:04.165
I got a bit freaked out last
night.

44:05.433 --> 44:06.401
You alright?

44:06.668 --> 44:08.036
Yea, yea, I'm fine.

44:08.503 --> 44:11.406
So Stacey's in the shower,
where's Trish?

44:11.439 --> 44:13.341
She went for a run.

44:13.375 --> 44:16.278
Typical Trish. You mean the brer
balls exercise?

44:16.712 --> 44:18.013
Tea or coffee?

44:18.047 --> 44:18.481
Tea!

45:53.818 --> 45:55.385
Stace. You ok?

45:57.721 --> 45:58.355
What?

46:01.058 --> 46:01.525
What?

46:02.593 --> 46:04.562
You just screamed, what's wrong?

46:04.596 --> 46:07.398
I'm a... I'm just losing my
marbles.

46:08.333 --> 46:11.336
Well you can't lose what you
don't have.

46:19.578 --> 46:21.781
I'm making breakfast, are you
coming?

46:22.548 --> 46:23.182
Uh yea.

46:23.582 --> 46:25.251
Are you sure you're ok?

46:28.522 --> 46:30.457
Yea... yea.

48:15.303 --> 48:16.472
Trish?

48:21.911 --> 48:23.612
What, what?

48:24.680 --> 48:25.581
What, what!

48:27.952 --> 48:30.153
There's nothing there babe.

48:30.620 --> 48:32.188
- Oh.
- There's nothing there.

48:38.495 --> 48:41.165
I think we all need to lay off
that weed.

48:42.433 --> 48:43.935
I think you're right.

48:47.906 --> 48:49.775
How about a cup of tea? Come on.

49:02.454 --> 49:02.889
Alright.

49:08.528 --> 49:10.229
- You alright?
- Not really.

49:11.932 --> 49:13.801
I'm definitely seeing things.

49:13.834 --> 49:15.904
No, that happened to me too.

49:17.038 --> 49:18.739
I swear it's that stuff we
smoked.

49:18.773 --> 49:20.240
Yea, no shit.

49:20.274 --> 49:20.909
Yea.

49:22.309 --> 49:23.577
I think you're right.

49:23.912 --> 49:25.412
C'mon let's get you cleaned up.

49:33.889 --> 49:37.258
I might... have been wrong about
Trish.

49:41.597 --> 49:43.733
Just looking out for my friends.

49:44.734 --> 49:45.936
I know you are.

50:18.604 --> 50:20.472
Breakfast of champions.

50:22.876 --> 50:25.611
Oh no, I'll do that,
you made the food.

50:28.015 --> 50:30.517
So what does everyone fancy
doing today?

50:30.550 --> 50:32.685
I'm just gonna chill by the
pool.

50:32.719 --> 50:34.922
I need to get some
content for my

50:34.955 --> 50:37.457
page but then I'm all yours.
Deal?

50:37.490 --> 50:38.358
Deal.

50:39.126 --> 50:40.228
Blake, what about you lovely?

50:40.262 --> 50:44.565
I'm all over that pool but...
this time you know not

50:44.598 --> 50:48.036
naked and not being chased
by large imaginary dogs.

50:50.604 --> 50:51.774
You finished yet?

51:29.681 --> 51:30.115
Oh!

51:30.883 --> 51:32.750
Where's Trish, babe?

51:32.785 --> 51:34.519
I think she went to make some
lunch.

51:34.552 --> 51:35.553
Do you want some?

51:35.587 --> 51:37.089
I could go a sandwich.

52:00.815 --> 52:02.116
You need a hand?

52:02.783 --> 52:03.451
No.

52:03.919 --> 52:04.752
Naughty.

52:06.154 --> 52:08.090
I think I can handle a cheese
and cucumber sandwich.

52:08.123 --> 52:10.658
I was the chef in our
relationship, remember?

52:10.691 --> 52:11.492
Fair point.

52:17.166 --> 52:18.567
Your day is it?

52:23.840 --> 52:25.141
Hold on to the tap.

52:31.115 --> 52:32.917
I've got some purses in my bag.

52:33.683 --> 52:34.118
C'mon.

52:36.053 --> 52:37.154
First a hill finds.

54:25.104 --> 54:25.737
What?

54:32.112 --> 54:32.980
Perv.

54:52.835 --> 54:54.769
How are you doing Blee?

54:54.804 --> 54:55.304
I'm fine.

54:59.674 --> 55:01.110
You know it was never my
intention...

55:01.143 --> 55:01.844
Look...

55:05.248 --> 55:08.051
I'm not saying I forgive you...
for what you did.

55:12.823 --> 55:13.656
But I just...

55:17.862 --> 55:20.064
It's so good being with you
again.

58:59.401 --> 59:00.202
What's up?

59:01.470 --> 59:03.073
Babe, do you know how long we've
been in bed for?

59:03.106 --> 59:04.374
Not long enough?

59:06.142 --> 59:09.546
Let's go funny about this, we
can pick this up later.

59:09.579 --> 59:10.980
Do you promise?

59:12.549 --> 59:13.950
Pinkie promise.

59:18.222 --> 59:18.889
No.

59:20.191 --> 59:20.624
No.

59:51.058 --> 59:52.126
Hello there.

59:52.159 --> 59:54.294
I hear you had a nice afternoon.

59:55.362 --> 59:56.230
Very funny.

59:57.731 --> 59:59.066
Where's Stace?

59:59.099 --> 1:00:01.235
Last I saw her she
was down by the pool.

1:00:01.268 --> 1:00:02.971
Should we go get her?

1:00:12.614 --> 1:00:13.248
Stace?

1:00:16.719 --> 1:00:17.353
Stace!

1:00:20.623 --> 1:00:22.291
Where the hell is she?

1:00:24.493 --> 1:00:26.095
Greenhouse!

1:00:48.586 --> 1:00:49.420
Stacey?

1:00:50.254 --> 1:00:51.290
You back there?

1:00:59.698 --> 1:01:01.767
We're looking for our friend.

1:01:01.800 --> 1:01:04.204
The little one,
have you seen her?

1:01:37.172 --> 1:01:39.509
Mr. Creepy Creeperson wasn't
much help.

1:01:41.677 --> 1:01:43.713
She's not in there and she's
not around the house. The

1:01:43.746 --> 1:01:46.215
only place we haven't
checked is the forest clearing.

1:01:46.782 --> 1:01:48.751
I think it's worth a shot.

1:01:48.784 --> 1:01:52.623
Well you two go and I'll stay
here in case she gets past you.

1:01:52.957 --> 1:01:56.326
And get the cocktails ready for
your return!

1:01:56.360 --> 1:01:58.195
We should probably wrap up.

1:01:58.228 --> 1:01:59.630
Yea, fair point.

1:02:00.264 --> 1:02:02.432
Make sure to take torches too,

1:02:02.466 --> 1:02:04.435
it gets dark out
here real quick.

1:02:04.469 --> 1:02:05.103
Ok.

1:04:31.494 --> 1:04:31.929
Stace!

1:04:34.664 --> 1:04:35.498
Stacey!

1:04:38.970 --> 1:04:39.804
Stace?

1:04:47.678 --> 1:04:48.312
Stacey!

1:04:53.585 --> 1:04:55.487
There's somebody watching us.

1:04:55.520 --> 1:04:56.588
What? Where?

1:04:56.621 --> 1:04:57.990
Behind that tree.

1:04:58.657 --> 1:05:00.927
Walk over there, keep doing what

1:05:00.960 --> 1:05:03.463
you're doing I'm
gonna sneak around.

1:05:07.868 --> 1:05:11.537
Don't know what to say babe,
doesn't look like she's here.

1:05:12.505 --> 1:05:14.340
I think we should head back.

1:05:19.346 --> 1:05:20.849
Why are you watching us?

1:05:21.983 --> 1:05:22.616
Sorry.

1:05:23.717 --> 1:05:26.020
I needed to be
sure you were alone.

1:05:26.922 --> 1:05:27.555
Why?

1:05:28.690 --> 1:05:30.391
You are in grave danger.

1:05:32.460 --> 1:05:35.965
Have you been hallucinating,
seeing the things you fear?

1:05:37.632 --> 1:05:39.435
What are you talking about?

1:05:39.735 --> 1:05:42.973
The ritual, the goddess, Mabon.

1:05:43.339 --> 1:05:45.441
You were the offering.

1:05:47.376 --> 1:05:48.477
Stay together.

1:05:49.846 --> 1:05:51.648
Your bond is what weakens her.

1:05:52.950 --> 1:05:55.853
Whatever she shows you...
it's only

1:05:55.887 --> 1:05:58.488
as real as you believe it to be.

1:06:01.058 --> 1:06:02.325
Face your fears.

1:06:04.395 --> 1:06:06.297
She's coming for you.

1:06:09.101 --> 1:06:10.535
Find your friends.

1:06:12.603 --> 1:06:13.038
Babe!

1:06:24.683 --> 1:06:25.317
Really?

1:06:26.887 --> 1:06:27.988
Fucking funny.

1:06:28.856 --> 1:06:32.059
Is that you Vinnie, or the perv
from last night?

1:06:49.077 --> 1:06:50.045
Ten Blake...

1:06:51.513 --> 1:06:53.715
You're getting crazier by the
day.

1:06:54.884 --> 1:06:56.651
Now I'm talking to myself.

1:10:03.188 --> 1:10:04.856
Blake, did you find her?

1:10:06.791 --> 1:10:07.225
Guys?

1:10:13.165 --> 1:10:13.798
Blake?

1:10:25.111 --> 1:10:27.747
Babe,
that woman is yanking our chain.

1:10:28.082 --> 1:10:29.749
Well then where are they?

1:10:30.150 --> 1:10:32.319
I just think there must be
a reasonable explanation

1:10:32.352 --> 1:10:34.620
and not the ramblings
of a crazy old woman.

1:10:34.654 --> 1:10:36.290
And Blake left her ban.

1:10:36.323 --> 1:10:37.224
Ok, fair point...

1:10:37.257 --> 1:10:39.027
Humor me here,
let's call the police and

1:10:39.060 --> 1:10:40.929
report them missing
that way when they come

1:10:40.962 --> 1:10:42.864
back we can
apologize and chalk it all

1:10:42.897 --> 1:10:44.698
up to me having a
funny five minutes. Ok?

1:10:45.066 --> 1:10:46.401
We can do that.

1:10:46.434 --> 1:10:48.369
Why don't you try the
cells outside and I'll try the

1:10:48.403 --> 1:10:51.006
land line, that way one of
us is bound to get through.

1:10:51.040 --> 1:10:53.008
No,
she said we shouldn't split up.

1:10:53.042 --> 1:10:55.743
Well what's gonna happen, we're
within 10 seconds of each other.

1:10:55.777 --> 1:10:58.247
I just don't think we should be
apart.

1:11:01.850 --> 1:11:03.987
I won't take my eyes off of you.

1:11:05.288 --> 1:11:05.956
Ok.

1:11:06.822 --> 1:11:07.690
Come on.

1:11:16.434 --> 1:11:19.904
If you don't get any signal just
come straight back.

1:11:35.753 --> 1:11:36.889
Emergency operator.

1:11:36.922 --> 1:11:38.224
Which service do you require?

1:11:38.258 --> 1:11:41.194
Yes, police, I want to report a
missing person.

1:11:42.962 --> 1:11:43.396
Hello?

1:11:46.866 --> 1:11:48.468
I understand you want to report

1:11:48.501 --> 1:11:49.369
a missing person.

1:11:49.402 --> 1:11:50.337
Yes, two of my friends

1:11:50.371 --> 1:11:51.005
Hello?

1:11:52.206 --> 1:11:53.773
Can you repeat that please?

1:11:55.309 --> 1:11:56.143
Hello?

1:11:56.177 --> 1:11:56.944
Hello?

1:12:17.300 --> 1:12:17.934
Hello?

1:12:22.138 --> 1:12:24.073
He matches your problem.

1:12:24.106 --> 1:12:25.141
Hello, hello?

1:12:28.178 --> 1:12:29.012
Hello?

1:12:30.080 --> 1:12:30.746
Shit.

1:13:27.276 --> 1:13:28.543
No, no, no, hello?

1:13:30.045 --> 1:13:30.479
Shit.

1:13:41.090 --> 1:13:42.292
I'm not afraid.

1:14:25.137 --> 1:14:27.174
Trish! Trish?

1:14:27.741 --> 1:14:30.310
Trish! Trish, what's happened?
Trish.

1:14:35.349 --> 1:14:37.551
I'm gonna get you out of here,
ok?

1:14:38.419 --> 1:14:39.587
Alright, come on.

1:14:40.555 --> 1:14:42.156
That's it, up we go. Come on.

1:14:42.824 --> 1:14:45.059
We gotta get you to a hospital.

1:15:09.119 --> 1:15:10.487
You are not real.

1:15:35.147 --> 1:15:35.614
Shit.

1:15:55.669 --> 1:15:56.703
Fuck!

1:16:17.426 --> 1:16:19.228
Get the fuck out of my way!

1:16:53.165 --> 1:16:53.999
No.

1:16:55.334 --> 1:16:57.469
You're not real,
you're not here!

1:17:09.516 --> 1:17:11.651
Take another
step and I'll shoot.

1:17:11.986 --> 1:17:13.386
I swear to God.

1:17:18.459 --> 1:17:19.593
I am your God.

1:17:29.137 --> 1:17:30.438
Oh you're pathetic.

1:17:31.640 --> 1:17:33.108
You always were.

1:17:35.544 --> 1:17:37.546
You don't deserve
someone like me.

1:17:40.182 --> 1:17:43.452
I should have just killed you
when I had the chance.

1:17:43.921 --> 1:17:49.125
No one would have missed you...
Not even your loser mother.

1:18:00.370 --> 1:18:02.373
No where to run little rabbit.

1:18:13.451 --> 1:18:14.820
It's time to die.

1:18:32.238 --> 1:18:34.140
A lot of spirit in you still.

1:18:36.576 --> 1:18:38.245
I'm not scared of you.

1:18:43.484 --> 1:18:45.519
You have no power over me...

1:18:47.655 --> 1:18:48.489
anymore.

1:19:20.824 --> 1:19:21.825
Fuck you bitch.

1:19:45.885 --> 1:19:48.521
Look at me. No, no.

1:20:02.270 --> 1:20:03.604
Destroyed. Just go.

1:20:14.450 --> 1:20:15.350
Are you ok?

1:20:16.318 --> 1:20:16.852
I love you.

1:20:16.885 --> 1:20:18.287
I love you too.
