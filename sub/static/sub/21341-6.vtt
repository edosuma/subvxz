Dino Dana!

00:12.280 --> 00:17.151
[theme music,
various dinosaurs roaring]

00:39.340 --> 00:41.642
Dino Dana!

[grunts]

01:03.497 --> 01:05.133
Almost done.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.771
Hey, Mr. Hendrickson.

01:10.804 --> 01:15.409
Mr. Hendrickson!

01:15.443 --> 01:18.246
Mr. Hendrickson.
Over here.

01:18.279 --> 01:20.814
It's Dana!

01:20.848 --> 01:22.850
Good morning, Dana.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.385
Guess what we are?

01:24.418 --> 01:26.120
Working independently?

01:26.154 --> 01:27.655
We're samesies.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.457
If you say so.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.725
[grunts]

01:31.759 --> 01:33.527
I do.

01:33.561 --> 01:36.164
Doesn't my
Pterodaustro

01:36.197 --> 01:38.166
look like
your flamingo?

01:38.199 --> 01:39.367
I suppose.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.768
And that's not all.

01:40.801 --> 01:43.637
Flamingos are birds
and Pterodaustro and Pterosaurs.

01:43.671 --> 01:45.373
Guess what they both can do,

01:45.406 --> 01:46.707
I'll give you a hint.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.278
Fly.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.512
Which reminds me,

01:51.545 --> 01:54.315
I better be
flying inside.

01:54.348 --> 01:56.184
Aren't you
going to ask me

01:56.217 --> 01:57.718
why I'm making
a Pterodaustro.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.187
Not particularly,

01:59.220 --> 02:01.355
but I'm sure
you're going to tell me.

02:01.389 --> 02:03.357
I'm doing
dino experiment 518,

02:03.391 --> 02:05.526
how does a Dromaeosaurus
use its claws?

02:05.559 --> 02:07.928
How does a Ptera-what-
you-ma-call-it help you in that?

02:07.961 --> 02:11.599
Pterodaustro
and I thought you'd never ask.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.634
The Dromaeosaurus
is a carnivore

02:13.667 --> 02:16.704
with curved claws
and it moved like this...

02:17.771 --> 02:22.743
[growls]

02:22.776 --> 02:25.513
But I've never
seen it in action.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.748
So, I'm using
the Pterodaustro as bait.

02:27.781 --> 02:29.950
Well, that sounds
destructive.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.552
Bye now.

02:31.585 --> 02:35.223
Hey, Mr. Hendrickson,
you forgot a flamingo.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.758
At least I think
it's a flamingo.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.593
It certainly
used to be.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.631
My daughter Gabrielle
painted this

02:43.664 --> 02:45.433
when she was
a little girl.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.801
Unfortunately,
it doesn't match the others

02:47.835 --> 02:49.803
so it stays
in the box.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.739
I didn't know
you had a daughter.

02:51.772 --> 02:54.542
- You never asked.
- Do you have a son?

02:54.575 --> 02:56.710
- No.
- Do you have another daughter?

02:56.744 --> 02:58.879
- No.
- Was your daughter like me?

02:58.912 --> 03:00.914
- Hm.
- Did she like dinosaurs?

03:00.948 --> 03:03.217
No, she prefers birds.

03:03.251 --> 03:05.419
Well, birds came
from dinosaurs.

03:05.453 --> 03:07.955
Maybe your daughter and I
are samesies too.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.223
[laughs]

03:09.257 --> 03:10.924
Mr. Hendrickson,
can you tell her

03:10.958 --> 03:13.294
I love how colorful
her paint job is?

03:13.327 --> 03:15.463
Will do.
[laughs]

03:15.496 --> 03:17.365
Bye, now.

03:17.398 --> 03:18.866
Bye, Mr. Hendrickson.

03:18.899 --> 03:21.235
I'll let you know
how my experiment goes.

03:21.269 --> 03:22.736
- I can't wait.

03:22.770 --> 03:26.340
Well, I'm going
to have to wait...

03:28.509 --> 03:30.344
For a Dromaeosaurus.

03:33.547 --> 03:38.519
[***]

03:38.552 --> 03:40.654
[squawks]

03:41.989 --> 03:43.891
And there's one now.

03:45.293 --> 03:47.328
[coos]

03:47.361 --> 03:49.730
It sees my Pterodaustro.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.433
[high pitched coo]

03:52.466 --> 03:54.602
I think it knows

03:54.635 --> 03:56.737
my Pterodaustro's
not real.

03:58.539 --> 04:01.775
[squawks]

04:01.809 --> 04:05.245
Oh, that's how you use
your claws, Dromaeosaurus.

04:06.714 --> 04:09.049
[high pitched coo]

04:09.082 --> 04:11.385
[Mr. Hendrickson]
I thought I heard a commotion.

04:12.453 --> 04:13.954
What did you do to my flamingo?

04:13.987 --> 04:15.523
Wasn't me.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.891
- Who did it?
- It was the Dromaeosaurus.

04:17.925 --> 04:21.362
Where is he? I don't see him.
All I see is you.

04:21.395 --> 04:23.297
- It ran away.
- Ran away?

04:23.331 --> 04:25.633
Must have thought your
flamingo was a Pterodaustro.

04:25.666 --> 04:28.702
The Dromie kicked out
it's legs like this,

04:28.736 --> 04:31.772
then flipped out
it's curved claws like this

04:31.805 --> 04:34.408
then ripped
your flamingo apart,

04:34.442 --> 04:35.476
like this.

04:35.509 --> 04:36.944
Squawk!

04:36.977 --> 04:39.680
Dino experiment
518 complete.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.815
The Dromaeosaurus
used its curved claws

04:41.849 --> 04:43.083
to attack prey.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.718
It was so awesome,

04:44.752 --> 04:48.356
but maybe not as awesome
for your flamingo.

04:48.389 --> 04:51.058
Should I put them away
so your Dromoesaurus

04:51.091 --> 04:53.594
doesn't uh,
destroy anymore?

04:53.627 --> 04:55.062
Dromaeosaurus.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.830
Don't worry,
Mr. Hendrickson.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.599
Now that I know how
the Dromaeosaurus

04:58.632 --> 05:00.334
used its claws,

05:00.368 --> 05:03.036
I'll figure out a way
to protect your flamingos.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.406
[sigh]

05:05.439 --> 05:07.908
Now, to figure out a way

05:07.941 --> 05:10.544
to protect
Mr. Hendrickson's flamingos.

05:11.712 --> 05:14.348
[squawks]

05:14.382 --> 05:16.384
I think I know.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.887
[Mr. Hendrickson]
The little girl downstairs.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.723
She said a dinosaur
ripped my flamingos apart

05:22.756 --> 05:24.825
with its claws.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.595
Yes, yes,
your flamingo is safe.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.430
I put it out.

05:29.463 --> 05:31.999
Good grief,

05:32.032 --> 05:34.902
she's putting
all my flamingos in a tree.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.505
Listen, I got to go.
I'll call you back.

05:37.538 --> 05:40.941
I'm always nice.
Bye.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.576
[sigh]

05:43.644 --> 05:46.747
[***]

05:49.983 --> 05:52.986
Now the flamingos are safe
from the Dromaeosaurus.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.456
They're flying just like
the Pterodaustro do.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.725
[squawks]

05:57.758 --> 05:59.793
Hello,
Dromaeosaurus.

05:59.827 --> 06:02.463
Your claws are great
at attacking on the ground

06:02.496 --> 06:04.164
but I don't think
they're great

06:04.197 --> 06:05.833
at attacking in the sky.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.501
[hisses]

06:07.535 --> 06:10.003
You don't just use
your claws to attack prey,

06:10.037 --> 06:12.172
you climb trees
with them too?

06:12.205 --> 06:14.174
Which means the flamingos
aren't safe.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.909
[squawks]

06:15.943 --> 06:19.079
Not the one Mr. Hendrickson's
daughter painted!

06:19.112 --> 06:21.449
[squawks and roars]

06:22.850 --> 06:26.186
[squawks]

06:26.219 --> 06:28.889
Ah no,
not another one.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.558
What did you do now?

06:30.591 --> 06:31.959
It wasn't me.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.661
- It was the Dromaeosaurus.
- Dromaeosaurus.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.162
Now you're getting it.

06:35.195 --> 06:38.599
And how exactly did it get
my flamingo down from up there?

06:38.632 --> 06:40.801
Does a Dromaeosaurus fly?

06:40.834 --> 06:43.170
No, it used it's claws
to climb the tree.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.938
It was amazing

06:44.972 --> 06:47.975
and upsetting
for your flamingos

06:48.008 --> 06:50.143
but don't worry
Mr. Hendrickson,

06:50.177 --> 06:51.945
I learn
from my mistakes.

06:51.979 --> 06:54.548
I'll figure out a way
to protect your flamingos.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.216
I got to go.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.819
I wonder why
the Dromaeosaurus

06:58.852 --> 07:01.589
didn't take
the colorful flamingo.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.857
Maybe it
really likes pink.

07:03.891 --> 07:06.894
[squawks]

07:06.927 --> 07:09.797
Hmm,
that Sinornithosaurus

07:09.830 --> 07:12.733
looks the same
as that colorful flamingo.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.134
Oh no.

07:14.167 --> 07:16.069
Watch out,
Sinornithosaurus.

07:16.103 --> 07:19.072
[both hissing]

07:19.106 --> 07:22.810
Why aren't you leaving,
Sinornithosaurus?

07:22.843 --> 07:26.079
[chirps and squawks]

07:26.113 --> 07:28.849
Why didn't the Dromaeosaurus
use it's claws on you,

07:28.882 --> 07:31.018
Sinornithosaurus?

07:31.051 --> 07:33.487
Maybe Mr. Hendrickson
can help.

07:33.521 --> 07:36.857
No, I didn't call you
to tell you that I was right.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.126
But I was right.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.894
She destroyed another one.

07:40.928 --> 07:42.129
[knock on door]

07:42.162 --> 07:43.764
Somebody's at the door.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.799
No, no, no.
Don't come over.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.601
[knock on door]

07:47.635 --> 07:49.469
You hang up
on your father.

07:51.839 --> 07:54.174
Mr. Hendrickson, the weirdest
thing just happened.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.644
Don't tell me.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.779
The Dromaeosaurus
came back

07:58.812 --> 08:01.181
and destroyed
another flamingo.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.950
No, but close.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.953
The Dromaeosaurs ran into
the Sinornithosaurus.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.288
What's a Psyan nick
a nymphasaurus?

08:08.321 --> 08:11.024
Sinornithosaurus.
This one.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.893
It's a small,
colorful dino

08:12.926 --> 08:14.862
but that's not
the weird part either.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.797
The weird part
is that the Dromaeosaurus

08:16.830 --> 08:18.899
didn't use it's claws
on the Sinornithosaurus.

08:18.932 --> 08:23.170
Instead, it ran away
from a way smaller dino.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.105
Isn't that weird.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.274
Maybe not so weird.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.276
Those colors
remind me of something.

08:29.309 --> 08:31.845
Would you get that book
for me, please?

08:31.879 --> 08:34.214
And my glasses?
I want to show you something.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.955
Okay.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.858
There it is right there.

08:44.892 --> 08:47.160
This is a blue
capped Frieda

08:47.194 --> 08:49.930
and this is
the Hooded Pitohui.

08:51.098 --> 08:53.166
Notice anything
about them?

08:53.200 --> 08:55.202
They both have
bright colors.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.037
That's right.
Can you guess why?

08:57.070 --> 08:59.072
Because they're pretty?

08:59.106 --> 09:00.708
Well, in a way.

09:00.741 --> 09:03.844
They want predators
to notice them

09:03.877 --> 09:07.014
because they
are poisonous.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.782
Birds are poisonous?

09:08.816 --> 09:10.083
Some are.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.019
Are you saying
the Sinornithosaurus

09:12.052 --> 09:13.754
might be poisonous?

09:13.787 --> 09:15.823
Well, did birds
come from dinosaurs?

09:15.856 --> 09:17.190
You know that they did.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.359
I know how to protect
your flamingos now.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.896
- Thank you, Mr. Hendrickson.
- You're welcome.

09:23.964 --> 09:28.869
[***]

09:31.338 --> 09:33.841
And done.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.175
[squawks]

09:35.208 --> 09:36.877
Hello, Dromaeosaurus.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.146
Your claws are great
at attacking on the ground

09:39.179 --> 09:40.981
and climbing trees

09:41.014 --> 09:44.618
but I don't think they want
to attack poisonous dinos.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.920
[squawks]

09:46.954 --> 09:49.957
Yes, the Sinornithosaurus
trick worked.

09:49.990 --> 09:53.193
Dino predators know not to mess
with poisonous dinos,

09:53.226 --> 09:56.063
even if they have
awesome curved claws.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.298
What happened
to my flamingos?

09:58.331 --> 10:01.201
I think they
look great, Dad.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.236
You must be Dana.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.906
- You must be his daughter.
- I'm Gabrielle.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.175
Don't you like
the flamingos, Daddy?

10:08.208 --> 10:10.243
Yes, I do.

10:10.277 --> 10:13.180
[chanting]
Hug her. Hug her. Hug her.

10:13.213 --> 10:16.383
[laughing]

10:16.416 --> 10:18.085
Alright.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.391
[Dana]
Next up, more Dino Dana!

10:26.459 --> 10:29.396
[***]

10:30.931 --> 10:33.901
[Dana]
Dino Dana!

10:33.934 --> 10:38.806
[theme music,
various dinosaurs roaring]

11:00.961 --> 11:03.230
Dino Dana!

11:03.263 --> 11:06.199
[roar]

11:11.504 --> 11:13.774

"The Dino Days Of Summer."

11:14.842 --> 11:18.111
[***]

11:21.982 --> 11:25.385
[***]

11:30.190 --> 11:32.726
[Dad]
Stop right there, nugget!

11:32.760 --> 11:34.762
[gasp]
Where do you think you're going?

11:34.795 --> 11:38.298
- To do a dino experiment.
- Not in that dress, you're not.

11:38.331 --> 11:41.101
Grandma won't be happy
if you get that dress dirty.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.836
And when Grandma's unhappy,
we're all--

11:42.870 --> 11:44.938
[Gloria]
Arman!

11:44.972 --> 11:47.474
- Yes, Gloria?
- Arman!

11:49.409 --> 11:50.978
Yes, Gloria?

11:51.011 --> 11:52.813
Arman!

11:52.846 --> 11:54.481
Yes, Gloria?

11:54.514 --> 11:56.917
No need to yell.
Where's the camera?

11:58.118 --> 11:59.787
On the table.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.789
What?

12:01.822 --> 12:03.523
On the table!

12:03.556 --> 12:05.325
Please, Dad,
it's hot out,

12:05.358 --> 12:08.261
which means I can finally
solve dino experiment 516:

12:08.295 --> 12:11.464
How do dinosaurs
keep cool when it's hot?

12:11.498 --> 12:15.202
Okay, but only if you
keep that dress clean.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.237
Arman, the camera's
not on the table.

12:17.270 --> 12:20.073
On the KITCHEN table?

12:20.107 --> 12:24.344
Well, your father
didn't say that, did he?

12:24.377 --> 12:27.948
I've got 50 tables in here.
Should I have checked them all?

12:27.981 --> 12:30.784
Oh, look at the mess
you've made of your shirt.

12:30.818 --> 12:33.486
That's a lotta sweat.
That can't be healthy.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.523
Let's get you inside.
Have you been exercising?

12:36.556 --> 12:38.792
- [whispered] Stay clean!
- C'mon.

12:40.360 --> 12:43.363
Now I just have to find
a dino for my experiment.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.232
[growl]

12:45.265 --> 12:46.266
[gasp]

12:46.299 --> 12:51.238
[dinosaur bellows]

12:51.271 --> 12:52.806
A Footalongasaurus!

12:53.874 --> 12:57.144
[***]

13:01.281 --> 13:04.818
[***]

13:06.453 --> 13:08.021
Footalongasaurus,

13:08.055 --> 13:10.023
your name means
"giant chief lizard"

13:10.057 --> 13:13.093
because you're one of the most
giant dinosaurs of all time.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.062
You're longer than
five school busses,

13:15.095 --> 13:17.264
and you weighed more
than 8 elephants.

13:18.331 --> 13:23.203
[***]

13:29.642 --> 13:31.478
Hello, Footalongasaurus.

13:31.511 --> 13:34.948
[grunting and snorting]

13:34.982 --> 13:36.249
[sneeze]

13:36.283 --> 13:38.318
Awww!
Hot air!

13:38.351 --> 13:39.987
Wait...

13:40.020 --> 13:43.023
I wonder how something
as big as you stays cool.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.157
[growl]

13:44.191 --> 13:46.326
- You hungry?
- [grunt]

13:46.359 --> 13:49.062
Oh, you're not eating.

13:49.096 --> 13:52.165
You're using the tree's shade
to block the sun.

13:52.199 --> 13:55.035
I wonder if I can
use you for shade...

13:56.469 --> 13:57.905
Ah.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.306
That's better.

13:59.339 --> 14:04.044
[irritated panting
from Footalongasaurus]

14:04.077 --> 14:06.046
[groan]

14:06.079 --> 14:08.015
What's wrong?

14:08.048 --> 14:10.617
I guess the tree's
not big enough

14:10.650 --> 14:12.619
to shade your
whole body.

14:12.652 --> 14:15.022
[scream]

14:15.055 --> 14:18.091
He's coming right for me!

14:18.125 --> 14:21.028
[scream]

14:24.231 --> 14:26.900
That...
was...

14:26.934 --> 14:28.668
incredible!

14:28.701 --> 14:30.570
Bye, Footalongasaurus.

14:30.603 --> 14:33.206
Hope you find more shade.

14:34.274 --> 14:39.212
[***]

14:40.280 --> 14:42.249
[panting]

14:42.282 --> 14:44.617
Mom, you won't believe
what I just discovered!

14:44.651 --> 14:46.419
[Mom]
Dana, you're covered in grass.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.555
- What happened?
- Footalongasaurus happened.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.557
She helped me solve
dino experiment 516:

14:50.590 --> 14:52.926
How do dinosaurs
stay cool when it's hot?

14:52.960 --> 14:54.294
Guess how they did it?

14:54.327 --> 14:56.596
By covering themselves in grass?

14:56.629 --> 14:59.399
No, by finding shade
and keeping out of the sun!

14:59.432 --> 15:02.335
That's great, honey, but please
be careful with this dress.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.304
Your grandma took
forever to make it.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.673
You know how she likes
everything to be perfect.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.976
- [Gloria] Eva!
- Yes, Mom?

15:09.009 --> 15:11.511
- We found the camera!
- Great!

15:11.544 --> 15:12.912
Your husband broke it.

15:14.181 --> 15:16.283
I'll be there in a second!

15:16.316 --> 15:17.584
Okay, nugget.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.219
Have fun finishing
your experiment.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.320
Just try to...

15:20.353 --> 15:21.321
"Stay perfect."

15:21.354 --> 15:23.490
Just for a bit longer.

15:23.523 --> 15:24.992
Eva!

15:26.293 --> 15:28.628
Oh.
You're wearing that dress again?

15:29.429 --> 15:30.998
Yes?

15:31.031 --> 15:33.600
It's just that I thought
we agreed on colors...

15:33.633 --> 15:35.368
But we don't have to match.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.070
I can change it.

15:37.104 --> 15:39.339
Oh...
Thanks.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.608
You know,
I would go with the fuchsia.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.610
That one flatters your figure.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.245
[whispering]
Just a bit longer.

15:47.047 --> 15:50.250
I have to find dino number two
for my experiment.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.289
Where's that dirt coming from?

15:57.357 --> 16:02.229
[***]

16:08.535 --> 16:09.636
Hm.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.738
Long quills...

16:11.771 --> 16:13.606
You must be the Psittacosaurus!

16:13.640 --> 16:15.208
Your name means
"parrot lizard"

16:15.242 --> 16:17.544
because you had
a beak like a parrot!

16:17.577 --> 16:19.546
But where's your face?

16:19.579 --> 16:21.581
I'll need to get
a closer look.

16:21.614 --> 16:26.053
[Psittacosaurus cooing]

16:26.086 --> 16:27.687
There you are!

16:27.720 --> 16:29.422
But where are you going?

16:29.456 --> 16:32.092
I need to see
how you stay cool!

16:32.125 --> 16:34.227
[cooing]

16:36.463 --> 16:38.131
Wait...

16:38.165 --> 16:41.368
I wonder if that hole you dug
helps keep you cool.

16:41.401 --> 16:44.071
Only one way to find out!

16:45.138 --> 16:48.007
[***]

16:52.545 --> 16:54.814
[sigh]
It does.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.816
The Psittacosaurus
made its own shade

16:56.849 --> 16:58.318
by digging holes.

16:59.452 --> 17:00.620
Oh, someone's in trouble...

17:02.789 --> 17:06.193
Grandma's going to be so mad
that you got your dress dirty.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.594
I'm doing a dino experiment.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.596
I just discovered
the Psittacosaurus

17:09.629 --> 17:11.598
dug holes to stay cool!

17:11.631 --> 17:14.201
Why do we have to wear
these dresses anyway?

17:14.234 --> 17:16.203
It's just what we do.

17:16.236 --> 17:17.704
Grandmas make dresses

17:17.737 --> 17:19.672
and granddaughters wear them.

17:19.706 --> 17:20.773
[Gloria]
Sara!

17:20.807 --> 17:22.409
Yes, Grandma?

17:22.442 --> 17:24.777
How many bows do you
want in your hair?

17:24.811 --> 17:27.647
None, thanks!

17:27.680 --> 17:30.650
[sigh] Quick, help me
hide in this hole.

17:35.322 --> 17:37.690
Hm.
It actually is cooler in here.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.292
I know, right?

17:40.760 --> 17:42.129
Ahem!

17:42.162 --> 17:45.365
Sweetheart,
what are you doing?

17:45.398 --> 17:48.501
You've got dirt all over
the beautiful dress I made you,

17:48.535 --> 17:50.170
and it's even in your hair!

17:51.804 --> 17:55.342
How many bows do you want
to make grandma happy again?

17:56.543 --> 17:58.411
Uh...
One?

17:58.445 --> 18:00.347
On each side?

18:00.380 --> 18:02.382
That's a very good idea.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.883
You'll look so lovely.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.585
Come with me.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.620
I can't wait to get started...

18:07.654 --> 18:09.822
[Sara]
Help, Seester!

18:09.856 --> 18:12.525
[Gloria] Maybe even some
extra ribbon hanging down...

18:12.559 --> 18:15.628
I wonder if there are any
other ways dinosaurs stay cool.

18:15.662 --> 18:18.265
- [growl]
- What was that?

18:19.332 --> 18:23.270
[***]

18:24.337 --> 18:25.838
Kosmoceratops?

18:25.872 --> 18:27.707
Your name means
"decorated horn face"

18:27.740 --> 18:31.211
because you have the most horns
on your face of any dinosaur.

18:31.244 --> 18:35.182
[grunting and growling]

18:35.215 --> 18:37.484
Are you going swimming
to stay cool?

18:38.685 --> 18:40.653
I guess not.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.922
Ooh, that's a lot of mud!

18:42.955 --> 18:45.358
That looks like fun,
but I can't get--

18:48.728 --> 18:50.497
...dirty.

18:50.530 --> 18:53.700
Oh, I'm gonna be
in so much trouble!

18:54.867 --> 18:57.437
...But I'm less hot.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.806
This mud is actually
cooling me down.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.442
Oh!

19:02.475 --> 19:04.511
Some dinos must cover
themselves in mud

19:04.544 --> 19:07.414
to stay cool and keep
the sun off their bodies.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.782
Dino experiment 516 solved.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.519
Thanks, Kosmoceratops.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.388
Not again!

19:16.623 --> 19:19.559
[***]

19:20.727 --> 19:22.429
Dana, there you are!

19:22.462 --> 19:24.163
It's time to fix your hair...

19:25.632 --> 19:28.167
...And your face,
and your body.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.771
What happened?

19:31.804 --> 19:33.940
I solved Dino Experiment 516.

19:33.973 --> 19:36.276
Some dinos stay cool
on hot days

19:36.309 --> 19:37.877
by finding shade,

19:37.910 --> 19:39.879
digging holes to
make their own shade,

19:39.912 --> 19:42.749
or covering themselves in mud.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.784
I'm sorry about
the dress, Grandma,

19:44.817 --> 19:46.853
but dino experiments
can be messy.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.688
Clearly.

19:48.721 --> 19:52.959
That's why I don't really
like wearing dresses...

19:52.992 --> 19:55.228
Why didn't you
just tell me that?

19:55.262 --> 19:59.232
Because grandmothers make things
and granddaughters wear them.

19:59.266 --> 20:01.901
Yes, but I want you
to like what I make.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.337
I mean, look how
happy Sara is!

20:04.371 --> 20:05.705
[Sara]
So happy.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.709
No, I have an idea...

20:09.742 --> 20:11.344
Follow me.

20:11.378 --> 20:14.414
I'm going to make you
something else to wear.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.318
It's picture time,
everyone!

20:18.351 --> 20:20.587
See how saying
"Just press the button"

20:20.620 --> 20:23.323
isn't helpful when there are
a lot of buttons?

20:23.356 --> 20:25.024
It's the big one on top.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.427
[beep]
See? Now that's helpful.

20:27.460 --> 20:30.563
C'mon!
[laugh]

20:30.597 --> 20:32.632
- Say...
- I love Grandma!

20:32.665 --> 20:35.735
[all laugh]

20:35.768 --> 20:38.004
I love Grandma!

20:38.037 --> 20:39.539
[snap]

20:41.040 --> 20:43.976
* [theme music]
