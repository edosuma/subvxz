Climbed back up the wall,
changed back into my nightgown,

09:14.855 --> 09:16.755
Can you at least
turn on the radio?

09:16.757 --> 09:18.356
Shut...

09:18.358 --> 09:19.691
Up.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.593
(girls continue sobbing)

09:25.832 --> 09:27.766
You're all gonna have
to leave school immediately,

09:27.768 --> 09:31.436
And i would avoid any contact
with each other ever again.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.738
But aren't her parents
gonna come looking for her?

09:33.740 --> 09:35.340
And the baby's father?

09:35.342 --> 09:37.108
Just leave the details to me.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.010
We can't just act
like this never happened.

09:39.012 --> 09:43.782
I am the administration's
liaison to greek life on campus.

09:43.784 --> 09:48.253
If a young sorority pledge dies
under my so-called supervision,

09:48.255 --> 09:49.955
My career is over!

09:50.891 --> 09:52.791
Her dreams are as dead as she is

09:52.793 --> 09:54.993
While mine still burn bright.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.229
I'm protecting you.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.565
I'm protecting your families.

10:00.567 --> 10:01.800
And you may think

10:01.802 --> 10:03.535
I'm a monster tonight,

10:03.537 --> 10:04.903
But years from now,

10:04.905 --> 10:07.739
When you have lived a boring,

10:07.741 --> 10:09.975
Painfully uncreative life

10:09.977 --> 10:12.811
In a home filled
with pottery barn sofas

10:12.813 --> 10:14.212
And no integrity,

10:14.214 --> 10:17.882
You're gonna remember me
as i truly am...

10:18.819 --> 10:22.821
...Your guardian angel.

10:22.823 --> 10:23.888
(all grunting, gasping)

10:24.825 --> 10:26.791
Hoods back on.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.095
I left the next day.

10:30.097 --> 10:33.498
Told my parents
it was from the stress.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.434
Other girls changed their names
and moved away.

10:36.436 --> 10:38.937
One girl killed herself,
i heard.

10:38.939 --> 10:42.273
Another girl
was institutionalized.

10:42.275 --> 10:45.844
The third is actually doing
pretty well on fox news.

10:46.780 --> 10:49.814
Munsch put the fear of god
into us that night.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.783
She's the devil, that one.

10:51.785 --> 10:54.185
(whispers):
The darkness.

10:54.187 --> 10:57.088
You can't tell her
i talked to you about this.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.657
Wha... What happened
to the baby?

10:58.659 --> 11:00.091
I mean, what
did munsch do

11:00.093 --> 11:01.660
With him?
I don't know.

11:01.662 --> 11:04.496
Like i said, she was
pretty stingy with the details.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.431
By the way, the baby was a girl.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.700
Oh, no...
See, that's not possible.

11:08.702 --> 11:10.769
It was a boy.
It's chad radwell.

11:10.771 --> 11:11.770
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:11.772 --> 11:12.837
Sweetheart...

11:12.839 --> 11:14.806
I looked at that baby up close.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.775
I know my peas and carrots.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.576
That baby was a girl.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.181
(soft gasp)

11:23.183 --> 11:24.449
(whispers):
Oh, my god.

11:30.857 --> 11:33.792
Vanilla latte,
cranberry-orange scone.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.293
Listen,
a little birdie

11:35.295 --> 11:36.695
Told me
you're thinking of running

11:36.697 --> 11:38.863
For kappa house president,
and i just want to say

11:38.865 --> 11:40.632
You have my full support.

11:40.634 --> 11:43.001
(chuckles) thanks, but unless
you're in kappa house,

11:43.003 --> 11:44.803
Your support doesn't matter.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.371
And why do you care anyway?

11:49.076 --> 11:53.078
Look, when people hear the word
"fraternity" these days,

11:53.080 --> 11:54.512
What do they think of?

11:54.514 --> 11:56.414
A video of a bunch
of white dudes

11:56.416 --> 11:58.083
Singing a racist chant
in the back of a bus

11:58.085 --> 12:00.885
Or kids dying
of alcohol poisoning.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.321
The greek system will be
obsolete in a generation

12:03.323 --> 12:05.724
If things don't change.

12:05.726 --> 12:09.861
But i believe you and i
represent that change.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.262
You and i?

12:12.499 --> 12:14.699
Wait, are you telling me

12:14.701 --> 12:16.534
That you're thinking of
running for president

12:16.536 --> 12:17.869
Of the dollar scholars?
(chuckles)

12:17.871 --> 12:19.738
Oh, blimey, no.
I already tried and lost.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.573
Trust me,
chad is unbeatable there.

12:21.575 --> 12:24.609
Do you think
i really can beat chanel?

12:24.611 --> 12:27.512
With the right campaign theme.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.180
My campaign needs a theme?

12:29.182 --> 12:31.783
So people know that you're not
just doing it to be popular.

12:31.785 --> 12:34.686
Just throw a party
as a fund-raiser

12:34.688 --> 12:37.055
For a cause
that's close to your heart.

12:37.057 --> 12:41.292
Well, i would like to see
sickle cell anemia eradicated

12:41.294 --> 12:42.961
In our lifetime.

12:44.464 --> 12:47.699
♪ ♪

12:47.701 --> 12:48.867
What's wrong with you, girl?

12:48.869 --> 12:50.101
It's nothing.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.369
I don't know. I just
found out something,

12:51.371 --> 12:52.370
And i feel like
i can't stop

12:52.372 --> 12:53.705
Thinking about it
until i talk

12:53.707 --> 12:54.873
To my dad. It's-it's nothing.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.442
Also, i'm sorry, is
anybody totally weirded out

12:57.444 --> 12:58.877
That we are doing
this in the same room

12:58.879 --> 13:00.445
That ms. Bean got her
face burnt off in?

13:00.447 --> 13:02.213
I mean, she literally
died right there.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.649
Um, this just in--
ms. Bean's not dead.

13:04.651 --> 13:06.618
She's haunting the campus
with her fatness

13:06.620 --> 13:08.620
And murdering people.

13:08.622 --> 13:10.655
Now, show me your
pumpkins, sows.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.657
We need to fedex them off to my
instagram followers right away

13:12.659 --> 13:15.293
For chanel-o-ween. Halloween
is right around the corner.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.729
My pumpkin's drunk.
Approved.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.298
Mine's charles manson.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.366
Love.

13:22.669 --> 13:23.668
Mine's chad radwell.

13:23.670 --> 13:24.836
Fine.

13:24.838 --> 13:25.837
Mine's hurricane andrew

13:25.839 --> 13:27.071
And the destruction
it wrought

13:27.073 --> 13:28.807
On the state of florida.

13:30.811 --> 13:33.278
Mine's just a regular

13:33.280 --> 13:34.445
Jack-o'-lantern,

13:34.447 --> 13:35.446
Which i'm sure you'll hate.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.815
Correct. Start over.

13:36.817 --> 13:37.982
Zayday?

13:39.853 --> 13:40.685
What the hell does that mean?

13:40.687 --> 13:42.120
Well, for halloween,

13:42.122 --> 13:43.755
I'm hosting
a haunted house

13:43.757 --> 13:45.456
To raise money
for sickle cell anemia.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.591
Because...

13:46.593 --> 13:48.860
Today is the day
that i declare my intention

13:48.862 --> 13:50.929
To run for president
of kappa house.

13:54.701 --> 13:56.768
What?!

13:57.671 --> 13:58.870
Wait...

13:58.872 --> 14:00.705
Why are you holding
a fund-raiser, though?

14:00.707 --> 14:02.707
To show my voters
that i'm a serious candidate

14:02.709 --> 14:05.310
And it isn't just
a popularity contest.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.846
Jennifer:
But all your voters
are in this room.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.514
You could have
just told us.

14:09.516 --> 14:12.116
Hey, jennifer, can you hop off
the spectrum for just a second?

14:13.286 --> 14:14.352
(exhales)

14:15.355 --> 14:16.955
I don't think you understand

14:16.957 --> 14:20.792
The magnitude of the
miscalculation you just made.

14:20.794 --> 14:22.961
I can assure you you will not

14:22.963 --> 14:25.029
Be winning an election
anytime soon.

14:25.031 --> 14:28.867
And when you lose, i am gonna
make it my lifelong passion

14:28.869 --> 14:30.902
To destroy your reputation.

14:30.904 --> 14:34.205
Let me brew you up a hot cup
of tellin' it like it is.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.541
You're a stuck-up
little sociopath,

14:36.543 --> 14:38.376
And everybody in this room
knows it.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.879
I'm reasonably confident
that these girls will kick

14:40.881 --> 14:43.882
Your psycho ass to the curb
the first chance they get.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.149
It might behoove
you to recall

14:45.151 --> 14:48.419
That everyone here witnessed
you actually murder someone,

14:48.421 --> 14:51.422
A fact that's one
anonymous phone call away

14:51.424 --> 14:54.158
From being a juicy little
segment on the local news.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.660
I didn't kill ms. Bean.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.596
And if i do murder someone,

14:58.598 --> 15:00.665
It's gonna be you.

15:13.880 --> 15:17.048
Chanel, it's 3:00 a.M.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.250
We're concerned about your
mental health.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.885
What are you doing?

15:20.887 --> 15:22.887
Just sharpening knives.

15:22.889 --> 15:26.524
Kitchen knives
should be... Razor-sharp.

15:27.727 --> 15:28.726
(sobs)

15:28.728 --> 15:30.728
Chanel, we're here
for you.

15:30.730 --> 15:31.796
It's gonna be okay.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.932
A sitting kappa president

15:33.934 --> 15:37.969
Has not lost the office
to a freshman in 150 years.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.771
I am responsible

15:39.773 --> 15:41.706
For the worst
pledge class

15:41.708 --> 15:43.975
In kappa history, and now

15:43.977 --> 15:46.778
Zayday's gonna win because
we live in the age of obama?

15:46.780 --> 15:48.546
I'll lose everything!

15:48.548 --> 15:51.215
Where will i go? Who will i be?

15:51.217 --> 15:52.884
Chanel, please.

15:52.886 --> 15:54.519
Put the knives down.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.221
(sighs)

15:57.223 --> 15:59.223
I'm sorry.

15:59.225 --> 16:01.793
I don't know what came over me.

16:01.795 --> 16:05.830
Look, zayday's throwing
a haunted house for charity,

16:05.832 --> 16:07.865
So... We'll just have to...

16:08.902 --> 16:09.968
...Throw another party, like...

16:10.637 --> 16:11.636
...Like, um...

16:11.638 --> 16:12.837
A haunted pumpkin patch.

16:12.839 --> 16:15.840
How very adolescent
of you to think of this.

16:15.842 --> 16:17.942
It vaguely smacks of something
my six-year-old sister

16:17.944 --> 16:19.177
Would be excited about, but...

16:20.113 --> 16:22.080
...Great. Yes.

16:22.082 --> 16:24.082
A haunted pumpkin patch
created expressly

16:24.084 --> 16:26.317
To raise money for some
disease more heinous

16:26.319 --> 16:28.486
Than zayday's sickle cell
anemia haunted house.

16:28.488 --> 16:32.090
Like, um, um...
Guinea worm.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.691
No.
Wolfman syndrome.

16:33.693 --> 16:34.659
No!
Bark skin.

16:34.661 --> 16:35.860
Next.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.695
Lamprey face.
No!

16:37.697 --> 16:38.830
Hold on.

16:39.499 --> 16:40.498
(sighs)

16:40.500 --> 16:42.100
It's the most

16:42.102 --> 16:44.002
Disgusting disease
in the history of mankind.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.004
You get it when you don't
even understand the most basic

16:46.006 --> 16:47.372
Tenets
of oral hygiene.

16:47.374 --> 16:48.373
Okay, what is it?

16:48.375 --> 16:49.674
Black...

16:49.676 --> 16:51.209
Hairy...

16:51.211 --> 16:52.877
Tongue.

16:55.715 --> 16:57.515
Chanels...

16:57.517 --> 16:59.384
Thank you.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.798
(cackles)
(screams)

17:13.800 --> 17:15.867
Aah! Let me in!
Let me in!

17:17.804 --> 17:19.871
(squirrel squeaking)

17:19.873 --> 17:22.373
(tv playing indistinctly)

17:22.375 --> 17:25.843
Just give the dang thing
its pot of gold already!

17:25.845 --> 17:26.844
(knocking)

17:26.846 --> 17:28.913
(cackling over tv)

17:35.755 --> 17:37.822
(knocking continues)

17:44.731 --> 17:47.732
I ain't got no candy!

17:47.734 --> 17:49.801
(floorboards creaking)

17:51.738 --> 17:53.805
(insects trilling)

18:11.791 --> 18:13.858
(squirrel squeaking)

18:18.798 --> 18:20.865
(whispering):
Did you hear that?

18:24.237 --> 18:26.304
(bang)

18:27.874 --> 18:30.341
(knocking)

18:36.783 --> 18:38.850
(bang)

18:41.121 --> 18:43.821
(shuddering breaths)
(knocking)

18:46.126 --> 18:48.192
(persistent thumping)

18:49.829 --> 18:52.897
(clanging, banging)

18:52.899 --> 18:54.065
(whimpering)

18:54.067 --> 18:56.134
(clanging, banging continue)

19:01.908 --> 19:03.975
(clanging, banging stop)

19:05.745 --> 19:08.646
(soft creaking)

19:18.825 --> 19:20.992
(screams)

19:22.362 --> 19:23.361
(screaming)

19:23.363 --> 19:24.428
(blade slashing)

19:31.771 --> 19:34.772
Oh, yeah.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.707
Bet you're
a sexy dirt-covered girl.

19:36.709 --> 19:37.708
That's what i bet you are.

19:37.710 --> 19:40.845
Ah. Who are you?

19:40.847 --> 19:44.849
"dorothy ann jesperson."

19:44.851 --> 19:46.717
What's up?

19:46.719 --> 19:47.718
My name's chad.

19:47.720 --> 19:48.886
(unzipping pants)
chad radwell.

19:48.888 --> 19:51.189
Hester:
Is that your grandmother?

19:52.525 --> 19:55.026
I was just, um... I was, uh...

19:55.028 --> 19:56.327
Say it.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.662
I don't know. Sometimes, uh...

19:57.664 --> 19:58.863
Sometimes i come out here

19:58.865 --> 20:00.198
And i just rub my hands
on the gravestones.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.535
When i find a gravestone i like,
i, um...

20:04.537 --> 20:07.004
Get turned on
and i-i rub one out to it.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.072
I get it.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.908
I get you more than anyone.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.877
I also find the
thought of dead bodies

20:12.879 --> 20:14.812
Extremely arousing.

20:14.814 --> 20:18.015
Oh, god, that is such
a relief to hear.

20:18.017 --> 20:21.786
I just don't understand why i
have all these dark feelings.

20:24.591 --> 20:27.358
You know, i just think
our generation's had it
too easy, you know?

20:27.360 --> 20:29.227
We haven't seen
enough horrible stuff.

20:29.229 --> 20:31.829
There's no awesome diseases
randomly killing people.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.097
There's not really
any awesome wars

20:33.099 --> 20:35.700
To go off to and witness
horrific things you can't unsee.

20:35.702 --> 20:38.102
We, like, pulled out
of all of 'em.

20:38.104 --> 20:39.837
(sighs)
i don't know.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.772
Sometimes i just don't even feel
like i'm living, you know?

20:41.774 --> 20:44.775
The only time i feel anything
is when i'm thinking
about chopping up a body.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.844
I feel the same way.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.681
And here you are,

20:50.683 --> 20:54.051
Saddled up with an uptight
girlfriend who freaked out

20:54.053 --> 20:56.454
For no other reason
than the fact

20:56.456 --> 20:58.889
That you just wanted to
fantasize about having sex

20:58.891 --> 21:01.792
With her
lifeless corpse.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.761
I want everything chanel has.

21:03.763 --> 21:04.762
Oh...

21:04.764 --> 21:06.964
And that includes you.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.866
Oh, my god,
i got a total chub right now.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.701
Hester:
Chanel's done.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.536
Zayday's gonna win
for kappa house president.

21:12.538 --> 21:13.738
And when she does,
i'm pretty sure

21:13.740 --> 21:15.740
That vice president
will fall into my hands.

21:15.742 --> 21:18.242
And when zayday just happens
to fall down a flight of steps

21:18.244 --> 21:20.311
Or drown in a retention pond,

21:20.313 --> 21:23.781
Then you will once again be
porking kappa's top bitch,

21:23.783 --> 21:26.784
And this bitch puts out.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.787
Okay, i need to do it right now.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.623
Right now on dorothy,
you and me, please.

21:32.625 --> 21:33.824
Not scary enough.

21:33.826 --> 21:36.327
We're alone
in a foggy cemetery.

21:36.329 --> 21:37.662
There's a serial killer
on the loose.

21:37.664 --> 21:38.796
Keep your phone on.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.798
And if you're lucky,

21:40.800 --> 21:42.800
Maybe in the next
couple of days,

21:42.802 --> 21:45.636
You'll get a call from someone
with a very scary location

21:45.638 --> 21:47.104
Of where to meet.

21:47.106 --> 21:49.940
And maybe...

21:49.942 --> 21:53.511
She'll let you in the back door.

21:53.513 --> 21:54.912
(exhales)

21:58.851 --> 22:00.918
Bye.

22:04.257 --> 22:07.258
Oh, my...

22:07.260 --> 22:09.493
What?

22:09.495 --> 22:11.829
Did you see that?

22:13.633 --> 22:17.068
He wants you, too, malachai.

22:20.873 --> 22:22.873
(on screen): He wants you, too.
(mouthing)

22:28.314 --> 22:30.047
(growling on screen)

22:41.494 --> 22:43.961
What... What could be scarier

22:43.963 --> 22:46.497
For an adult than a child
coming to murder them?

22:46.499 --> 22:48.733
Huh? No? No one?

22:48.735 --> 22:50.701
Isn't that all of
our greatest fear?

22:50.703 --> 22:54.305
That the pain, the regrets,
the mistakes of our youth

22:54.307 --> 22:57.708
Will destroy us
in our adulthood?

22:57.710 --> 23:00.511
That we can't escape...

23:00.513 --> 23:02.580
Our inner child.

23:02.582 --> 23:03.814
One we would rather forget,

23:03.816 --> 23:06.384
But who, at the end
of the day...

23:06.386 --> 23:08.452
Has all the power.

23:11.524 --> 23:13.958
See you next tuesday.

23:21.667 --> 23:23.167
Hey, gracie.

23:23.169 --> 23:25.569
How come we never
talk about mom?

23:25.571 --> 23:28.372
You told me that she
went to this school

23:28.374 --> 23:29.740
And that she joined kappa

23:29.742 --> 23:32.042
And that died when i was
two and not much else.

23:32.044 --> 23:35.746
It's hard for me
to talk about sometimes.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.381
I miss her a lot.

23:37.383 --> 23:39.183
It's pretty convenient.

23:39.185 --> 23:41.786
That she died in a fire.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.754
All of her stuff got burned.

23:43.756 --> 23:46.590
Any record of her.

23:46.592 --> 23:48.025
My birth certificate.

23:48.027 --> 23:49.593
What are you talking about?

23:49.595 --> 23:51.195
Why are you lying to me?

23:51.197 --> 23:53.798
Something does
not make sense.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.767
Why did this all start happening
as soon as i got to campus?

23:56.769 --> 23:59.136
Why am i the only person
in kappa without a mother?

23:59.138 --> 24:02.873
Shh. Hey. Honey.

24:02.875 --> 24:04.942
You got to give me
more here, okay?

24:04.944 --> 24:06.944
I don't understand
what you're getting at.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.813
Are you on bath salts?

24:08.815 --> 24:10.815
Just tell me.

24:10.817 --> 24:13.784
Tell me the truth.
Tell me right now.

24:13.786 --> 24:17.388
Am i the baby that was
born in kappa that night?

24:17.390 --> 24:19.156
Did mom die in
that bathtub?

24:19.158 --> 24:20.925
What?

24:20.927 --> 24:22.560
No, you were born
in a hospital.

24:22.562 --> 24:25.796
I was there. I saw you
come out of your mother.

24:25.798 --> 24:26.797
Big mistake, by the way.

24:27.834 --> 24:29.900
This is crazy.
Gracie!

24:29.902 --> 24:31.602
I am going to find out

24:31.604 --> 24:32.903
What's going on.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.271
And if you lied to me
and it turns out

24:34.273 --> 24:35.473
You're the killer seeking some

24:35.475 --> 24:37.107
Sick act of revenge
because mom

24:37.109 --> 24:38.309
Did die
in the bathtub that night,

24:38.311 --> 24:40.845
Then i am never
speaking to you again!

24:40.847 --> 24:43.647
Gra... Come on.

24:43.649 --> 24:45.916
(door closes)

24:50.823 --> 24:52.890
(phone chimes)

25:15.281 --> 25:17.381
(door creaks open)

25:28.160 --> 25:30.160
Pete? Uh...

25:30.162 --> 25:31.562
Boo!
Oh!

25:31.564 --> 25:33.464
(laughs)
gotcha.
God.

25:33.466 --> 25:35.799
Honestly--
don't do that.

25:35.801 --> 25:37.568
Why are we even here?

25:37.570 --> 25:39.203
To find out who
that baby was. Come.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.738
Boo!
Aah!

25:40.740 --> 25:42.840
(laughs)
yeah, see? Not so fun,

25:42.842 --> 25:43.908
Is it?

25:43.910 --> 25:45.142
What are you
guys doing here?

25:45.144 --> 25:46.844
Scoping the place out.
Spooky, right?

25:46.846 --> 25:48.012
This is where we're
having the haunted house

25:48.014 --> 25:49.246
For sickle-cell anemia.

25:49.248 --> 25:50.915
(group shouts, gasps)
hell, no, you won't!

25:50.917 --> 25:53.217
This house is haunted.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.152
She's right.

25:55.154 --> 25:59.056
Both:
See, i did some research
down at the library...

25:59.058 --> 26:00.591
When?
When?

26:00.593 --> 26:02.426
Last night.
Last night.

26:02.428 --> 26:04.428
Both:
I didn't see you there.

26:04.430 --> 26:05.729
Which library?
Which library?

26:05.731 --> 26:07.665
Baker street.
North jackson.

26:07.667 --> 26:08.699
Oh.
Oh.

26:08.701 --> 26:10.000
Okay.
Yeah.

26:10.002 --> 26:12.236
See, i wanted
to do some research

26:12.238 --> 26:14.872
On the hag
from shady lane.

26:14.874 --> 26:17.541
There's a legend in this
neighborhood about a woman

26:17.543 --> 26:19.677
Who wailed about
her dead children.

26:19.679 --> 26:21.679
And this was the

26:21.681 --> 26:22.780
House she lived in.
House she lived in.

26:22.782 --> 26:23.781
Yeah.

26:23.783 --> 26:26.016
Neighbors said
they heard a woman

26:26.018 --> 26:28.919
<i>Moaning and howling low.</i>
(woman moaning)

26:28.921 --> 26:30.921
<i>But then some people said,</i>
<i>"oh, no, that's just</i>

26:30.923 --> 26:34.725
The wind or a raccoon
singing. Until one day,

26:34.727 --> 26:38.862
Some kids looked up and saw her
standing in the window,

26:38.864 --> 26:40.898
Dressed in black,

26:40.900 --> 26:42.967
Staring out at that street,
just a-moanin'.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.768
(moans eerily)

26:46.105 --> 26:48.205
Now, they tried
to tell folks

26:48.207 --> 26:49.807
About the hag
in the old house

26:49.809 --> 26:53.077
On shady lane, but
nobody believed 'em. Mm-mm.

26:53.079 --> 26:55.546
They said, "these dumb ol' kids
are smoking crack.

26:55.548 --> 26:57.481
Ain't no hag
in the house on shady lane."

26:57.483 --> 26:58.816
But then...

26:58.818 --> 27:01.285
<i>Someone</i> else<i> saw her.</i>

27:01.287 --> 27:02.953
(screams)

27:04.724 --> 27:06.624
Pete:
<i>The woman just thought the hag</i>

27:06.626 --> 27:07.791
<i>Was rooting around</i>
<i>for food...</i>

27:07.793 --> 27:09.727
But then them kids...

27:09.729 --> 27:11.929
Heard that caterwauling again.

27:11.931 --> 27:14.732
So they snuck
into this house

27:14.734 --> 27:15.733
And went

27:15.735 --> 27:17.334
<i>Upstairs to the bedroom.</i>

27:17.336 --> 27:18.335
(woman wailing, moaning)

27:18.337 --> 27:19.336
<i>And do you know</i>

27:19.338 --> 27:20.404
What they saw?

27:22.174 --> 27:23.807
Do you?!

27:25.578 --> 27:27.678
Oh, my god.

27:27.680 --> 27:29.847
They're toys she picked up
from all over the neighborhood.

27:29.849 --> 27:31.281
That's incredible.

27:31.283 --> 27:33.484
I think it's incredible
what you can find out

27:33.486 --> 27:36.687
With just a quick trip
down to your local library.

27:36.689 --> 27:39.823
And you know what year it was?
1995.

27:39.825 --> 27:41.659
The same year
as the bathtub baby.
Mm-hmm.

27:41.661 --> 27:43.494
Nobody touch anything.

27:43.496 --> 27:45.696
This can be one of the
rooms for the haunted house.

27:45.698 --> 27:48.866
Uh, zayday, can i talk
to you for a second...

27:48.868 --> 27:50.934
In private?

27:53.305 --> 27:54.705
Hold it right there.

27:54.707 --> 27:58.642
What exactly do you plan on
doing at this haunted house?

27:58.644 --> 28:00.878
Well, i was thinking we could
blindfold folks and make 'em

28:00.880 --> 28:02.813
Put their hands in a bowl
full of grapes we peeled,

28:02.815 --> 28:04.181
So it'll feel like eyeballs.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.849
It's for the fund-raising.

28:05.851 --> 28:07.651
We're trying to raise money.

28:07.653 --> 28:10.487
More like raise the body count.

28:10.489 --> 28:11.822
With murder.

28:11.824 --> 28:13.857
Oh, yeah.

28:13.859 --> 28:16.060
I'm onto you,
zayday williams.

28:16.062 --> 28:19.496
I think the reason you want
to have a haunted house party

28:19.498 --> 28:22.733
Is 'cause a haunted party is
like a buffet for murderers.

28:22.735 --> 28:24.835
Yeah, yeah, you
can just go around

28:24.837 --> 28:26.370
Killing anybody you
want and ain't nobody

28:26.372 --> 28:28.472
Even gonna even notice.
Just like you

28:28.474 --> 28:31.175
Chopped the arms off
that dumb-ass golf guy.

28:31.177 --> 28:34.244
Oh, ho-ho! Didn't know i
knew that, did you? Yeah.

28:34.246 --> 28:36.013
I got you.

28:36.015 --> 28:38.482
Denise hemphill knows
you own a chain saw

28:38.484 --> 28:41.185
And you were supposed to be

28:41.187 --> 28:43.387
At your philosophy
study group that night,

28:43.389 --> 28:45.656
But you never showed up.

28:45.658 --> 28:47.858
Because i skipped it
to go to the burger shack

28:47.860 --> 28:49.359
With jennifer
the candle blogger.

28:49.361 --> 28:51.061
Ooh, burger shack.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.696
But can i ask you
something?

28:52.698 --> 28:54.832
Why do you
have it out for me?

28:54.834 --> 28:56.767
Maybe it's because
<i>you're</i> the killer.

28:56.769 --> 29:00.270
What?! That... That is
ridiculous. That's crazy.

29:00.272 --> 29:02.039
Is it?
Because i happen to know

29:02.041 --> 29:04.374
You also went
to wallace university

29:04.376 --> 29:07.277
And also pledged kappa.
Oh, that's right.

29:07.279 --> 29:09.079
When i snuck into the archives
to find the paperwork

29:09.081 --> 29:11.782
To file my candidacy
for chapter president,

29:11.784 --> 29:14.084
I found a list of pledges

29:14.086 --> 29:16.854
From 1988,
and one of them

29:16.856 --> 29:20.924
Was named denise hemphill.

29:20.926 --> 29:23.861
♪ oh ♪

29:23.863 --> 29:25.295
♪ tell it to my heart... ♪

29:25.297 --> 29:26.697
I'm so sorry.

29:26.699 --> 29:28.732
I think
there's been a mistake.

29:28.734 --> 29:31.268
The african sorority
is omicron omicron omicron

29:31.270 --> 29:32.736
And their house
is down the street.

29:32.738 --> 29:34.905
I know. I don't want
to be a member of the ooo house.

29:34.907 --> 29:37.775
Look at me. (giggles)
i want to be a kappa.

29:37.777 --> 29:39.443
(wry laugh)

29:39.445 --> 29:41.812
I don't think you'd like it
here at kappa house.

29:41.814 --> 29:43.580
(mocking laughter echoing)

29:43.582 --> 29:45.249
Once she was rejected,

29:45.251 --> 29:46.583
She dropped
out of school.

29:46.585 --> 29:47.584
Mm.

29:47.586 --> 29:51.355
And enrolled in
community college.

29:55.661 --> 29:58.061
That's good sleuthin',
zayday williams.

29:58.063 --> 29:59.596
Mm-hmm.

29:59.598 --> 30:01.165
You might be able to get a job

30:01.167 --> 30:03.467
With secure enforcement
solutions one day,

30:03.469 --> 30:06.270
If you decide to give up
murdering folks for a living.

30:06.272 --> 30:08.772
You have it out for me
because when you were here,

30:08.774 --> 30:10.774
Kappa wouldn't accept
women of color.

30:10.776 --> 30:13.510
So now you look at me and see
everything you could've been.

30:13.512 --> 30:17.247
Well, you're just gonna have to
see me take it one step further

30:17.249 --> 30:20.450
By becoming the first
black president of kappa house.

30:20.452 --> 30:22.820
And that's just gonna
chap your hide.

30:22.822 --> 30:24.822
Make you want
to kill, kill, kill, huh?

30:24.824 --> 30:27.257
Happy halloween, zayday.

30:27.259 --> 30:28.826
I hope you have a
good time at your

30:28.828 --> 30:31.862
Haunted party and get to
murder lots of folks.

30:31.864 --> 30:32.863
Just remember--

30:32.865 --> 30:36.867
Denise hemphill
has her eyes on you.

30:49.381 --> 30:50.814
Chanel:
I have it on good authority

30:50.816 --> 30:52.316
That the red devil
is gonna kill someone

30:52.318 --> 30:55.319
In zayday's haunted house.
Don't let it be you.

30:55.321 --> 30:56.820
How do you know
that's gonna happen?

30:56.822 --> 30:58.689
I don't, but how stupid
would the killer be

30:58.691 --> 31:00.490
To not kill someone there?

31:00.492 --> 31:02.459
It's halloween,
everyone will be in costume.

31:02.461 --> 31:03.694
Hell, he could kill someone

31:03.696 --> 31:05.863
And people would think
it was decoration.

31:05.865 --> 31:07.064
You have this
way too thought out.

31:07.066 --> 31:08.799
Isn't this kind of nice?

31:08.801 --> 31:11.668
I mean, why else did we all join
a sorority in the first place?

31:11.670 --> 31:13.837
My sense of personal identity
is completely external.

31:13.839 --> 31:15.739
If i didn't have
kappa to define me,

31:15.741 --> 31:17.841
I really don't
have much to offer.

31:17.843 --> 31:19.743
I've found that my
particular style of speaking

31:19.745 --> 31:22.546
And gesticulation is extremely
off-putting to most boys.

31:22.548 --> 31:25.349
And girls. And anyone. But with
kappa as my calling card,

31:25.351 --> 31:27.417
Everyone seems to overlook that.

31:27.419 --> 31:29.987
I joined for whatever
reason you joined, chanel.

31:29.989 --> 31:33.891
No, i'm talking about girls
uniting with a common goal.

31:33.893 --> 31:37.728
I needed you guys to totally
crush the will of young zayday.

31:37.730 --> 31:39.096
To destroy
her haunted house, sure,

31:39.098 --> 31:40.998
But also to destroy
her spirit.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.233
And you have all
rallied around me.

31:43.235 --> 31:46.536
Just like i would do for any of
you if i wasn't busy that day.

31:46.538 --> 31:48.672
I need to eat.
My blood sugar is crashing.

31:48.674 --> 31:51.241
I would be honored to
treat you all to lunch.

31:51.243 --> 31:52.910
We always bring our own.

31:59.752 --> 32:01.418
I am so grateful

32:01.420 --> 32:04.221
That you guys are sharing your
not-food lunch with me, but

32:04.223 --> 32:05.722
Won't we, like, die

32:05.724 --> 32:06.924
If we eat cotton balls?

32:06.926 --> 32:07.925
Only if they cause a blockage

32:07.927 --> 32:09.259
In our intestinal tracts,

32:09.261 --> 32:10.560
But that's
what the sauce is for.

32:10.562 --> 32:11.795
Chanel #5:
Lubrication.

32:11.797 --> 32:13.130
And it gives you that
wonderfully full

32:13.132 --> 32:14.698
Feeling without
all of the calories.

32:16.735 --> 32:18.302
You know what?
Poo belly is right.

32:18.304 --> 32:21.405
I'm tired of depriving myself
of joy and sustenance.

32:21.407 --> 32:23.206
I mean, for what?
So a boy will like me?

32:23.208 --> 32:25.609
Guys can be as porky
as they want and we still

32:25.611 --> 32:26.877
Like them.
I'm skinny as

32:26.879 --> 32:28.912
Karen carpenter in the morgue
and chad radwell still

32:28.914 --> 32:30.714
Won't commit to me.

32:30.716 --> 32:32.616
I may die at the end
of a serial killer's blade,

32:32.618 --> 32:33.951
But i refuse to die hungry.

32:34.987 --> 32:36.820
Let's go get some pizza.

32:40.092 --> 32:42.993
(tommy imitates wolf howl)

32:42.995 --> 32:44.661
Which one of you ladies

32:44.663 --> 32:46.430
Would like to be my costume
for halloween?

32:46.432 --> 32:48.632
I'm going as "dude having

32:48.634 --> 32:50.834
Awesome sex with you."
(chuckles)

32:50.836 --> 32:52.302
Who the hell
do you think you are?

32:52.304 --> 32:54.504
Uh... Tommy?

32:54.506 --> 32:55.672
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, ladi...

32:55.674 --> 32:57.240
Ladies.
All right?

32:57.242 --> 32:59.609
He was just
trying to be nice, okay?
Yeah.

32:59.611 --> 33:00.978
I mean, what in the hell's wrong
with the world where a guy can't

33:00.980 --> 33:02.779
Even whistle at a chick just
to tell her she looks hot?

33:02.781 --> 33:05.615
I mean, how else are people
supposed to meet people?

33:05.617 --> 33:08.285
I recently took a women's
studies class. Yes, because

33:08.287 --> 33:10.620
It was a requirement,
but i learned a lot anyways.

33:10.622 --> 33:13.090
Like the culture that says
it's okay for a man to objectify

33:13.092 --> 33:15.258
A woman for her appearance
is the same culture

33:15.260 --> 33:17.627
That pressures girls as young
as ten to have eating disorders.

33:17.629 --> 33:19.463
So you're basically saying
i'm the one

33:19.465 --> 33:20.864
Responsible for making you
look hot?

33:22.301 --> 33:24.001
You're welcome.

33:24.003 --> 33:26.203
There is a killer
on this campus murdering women.

33:26.205 --> 33:28.872
When you treat us like meat,
you're no better than him!

33:29.808 --> 33:31.441
You're gonna tell
us to smile now?

33:31.443 --> 33:32.876
Call us sweetheart?

33:32.878 --> 33:35.712
Actually, yes. It's kind of
my signature move.

33:35.714 --> 33:37.047
Yeah, well, this is mine!

33:37.049 --> 33:38.115
(groaning)

33:39.785 --> 33:42.686

34:46.752 --> 34:48.051
Where you wanted us to meet.

34:48.053 --> 34:50.287
What are you talking about?
You texted me.

34:50.289 --> 34:52.756
Hmm. Mysterious.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.391
Makes it

34:54.393 --> 34:55.759
Extra scary.

34:55.761 --> 34:57.394
So,

34:57.396 --> 34:58.962
Do you think
you're man enough

34:58.964 --> 35:01.798
To take me inside that
house and attack my crack?

35:01.800 --> 35:04.568
I guarantee you
i'm man enough for that.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.570
(door creaks open)

35:06.572 --> 35:08.638
Oh. Oh, yeah.

35:09.808 --> 35:11.741
Haunted house doesn't even
start for another two hours.

35:11.743 --> 35:13.810
Why would they light
all the candles?

35:13.812 --> 35:15.278
It seems wasteful.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.813
Come on.

35:16.815 --> 35:19.683
I'll sure this house has
an amazingly romantic basement.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.320
This is so hot.

35:23.322 --> 35:24.821
(sighs)

35:24.823 --> 35:27.924
Hey, so, uh,
a little awkward since

35:27.926 --> 35:29.793
We're about to bone down
and everything,

35:29.795 --> 35:31.595
But, um, what's your name?

35:31.597 --> 35:33.597
Hester.

35:33.599 --> 35:34.664
(silently mouths)

35:34.666 --> 35:36.266
Right.

35:36.268 --> 35:38.835
That's great.
I love that name.

35:38.837 --> 35:42.739
So, uh... Hester?

35:46.345 --> 35:48.011
Hester, where are you?

35:48.013 --> 35:49.379
Hester:
This way.

35:50.849 --> 35:52.916
What...?

35:53.819 --> 35:55.352
(sniffing)

35:55.354 --> 35:57.721
Oh. Smells like roadkill.

36:01.026 --> 36:02.325
Yo, hester!

36:02.327 --> 36:04.794
Kind of make it hard
to throw you a bone

36:04.796 --> 36:06.296
When i can't even find you.

36:06.298 --> 36:07.764

36:32.558 --> 36:35.625

You should go back in and enjoy
the awesome haunted house

39:39.978 --> 39:42.645
And know that non-emergency
calls to 911

39:42.647 --> 39:45.048
Waste hundreds of thousands
of taxpayer dollars every year.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.316
You actually make
a real good point

39:46.318 --> 39:48.017
About the taxpayers
wasting they dollar,

39:48.019 --> 39:51.154
And when i become the president,
i'll really try to fix... That.

39:51.156 --> 39:52.355
Thought i saw
or heard something.

39:52.357 --> 39:53.723
But like i said,
dead people are...

39:53.725 --> 39:56.559
(screaming)

39:57.729 --> 39:59.729
We have to file
a missing persons report.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.364
Someone's kidnapped zayday.

40:01.366 --> 40:02.565
Chanel:
I just hope

40:02.567 --> 40:04.033
She's found alive in
time for the election.

40:04.035 --> 40:05.235
I mean, it would be
insane to vote

40:05.237 --> 40:06.603
For a girl who
might already be dead.

40:06.605 --> 40:08.204
Dean munsch, you got
to shut down this campus

40:08.206 --> 40:09.672
Immediately!

40:09.674 --> 40:11.374
Oh, hello, weston.

40:11.376 --> 40:13.276
There are five dead bodies
in that house.

40:13.278 --> 40:15.779
Laid out in horrible
and deliberate macabre poses.

40:15.781 --> 40:18.181
The department is not prepared
to say that the bodies there

40:18.183 --> 40:20.583
Are related in any way
to these alleged incidents

40:20.585 --> 40:21.885
That have been
happening on campus.

40:21.887 --> 40:24.187
Because it's
an off-campus house.

40:24.189 --> 40:25.221
You can't be serious.

40:25.223 --> 40:27.791
Let's go over the list
of dead people.

40:27.793 --> 40:28.792
Ms. Bean,

40:28.794 --> 40:30.059
<i>Who, apparently,</i>
<i>has been dead</i>

40:30.061 --> 40:31.428
For a few weeks...
Mm-hmm.

40:31.430 --> 40:33.129
And, also, apparently,
had her face

40:33.131 --> 40:34.564
Fried off.
Chanel:
What?!

40:34.566 --> 40:36.800
Not ms. Bean! No! No!

40:37.769 --> 40:39.636
They were very close.

40:39.638 --> 40:41.871
More importantly,
not a student.

40:43.208 --> 40:44.207
Next?

40:44.209 --> 40:45.575
Chisholm:
<i>Shondell washington.</i>

40:45.577 --> 40:47.777
Security guard.
Also dead at least two weeks.

40:47.779 --> 40:50.947
Also... Not a student.

40:50.949 --> 40:52.081
Chisholm:
<i>A jane doe.</i>

40:52.083 --> 40:53.483
Approximate age, 40.

40:53.485 --> 40:55.385
Uh, cause of death:

40:55.387 --> 40:57.153
Stabbed a whole lot
and all over.

40:57.155 --> 40:58.988
And not a student.
Uh-uh.

40:58.990 --> 40:59.989
Well, what about coney?

40:59.991 --> 41:01.658
Pete:
<i>Yeah, yeah, his head</i>

41:01.660 --> 41:03.159
Was chopped off by a chain saw,
just like the one

41:03.161 --> 41:04.661
The red devil used
to cut that guy's arms off.

41:04.663 --> 41:07.397
Now, i'm no detective,
but that

41:07.399 --> 41:09.466
Does seem a little more
than coincidental.

41:09.468 --> 41:10.733
Chanel #5:
<i>And chanel #2!</i>

41:10.735 --> 41:12.402
I mean, i know for a fact
she was a student.

41:12.404 --> 41:14.671
Yeah, she was in my art history
class, i think.

41:14.673 --> 41:16.840
If you continue
to refuse to admit

41:16.842 --> 41:18.975
That this campus and
its students are under attack,

41:18.977 --> 41:21.010
Then i will be forced
to go to the media.

41:21.012 --> 41:24.948
Okay, adults, why don't
we head into the kitchen?

41:24.950 --> 41:29.519
We can discuss the best course
of action over crêpes.

41:33.592 --> 41:35.358
You are not leaving
this house tonight.

41:35.360 --> 41:37.327
Dad.
Now don't argue with me. Stop.

41:37.329 --> 41:38.761
(sirens wailing)
sir, you have nothing
to worry about.

41:38.763 --> 41:41.164
I will keep a close
eye on her. I'm pete.
Just stop.

41:41.166 --> 41:42.599
Who is this dude?

41:42.601 --> 41:44.667
He's just not gonna
like you.

41:44.669 --> 41:47.804
Wait. Um, excuse me.
Where are you going?

41:47.806 --> 41:50.473
We need to form a search party
for zayday?

41:50.475 --> 41:52.308
Zayday should have
considered the fact

41:52.310 --> 41:54.844
That she was going to get
kidnapped before betraying me.

41:54.846 --> 41:56.813
You know what, chanel?

41:56.815 --> 41:58.214
You make it harder and harder

41:58.216 --> 41:59.849
To believe
that you're not the killer.

42:01.720 --> 42:05.321
Ladies, we have a pumpkin patch
fund-raiser to attend to.

42:05.323 --> 42:07.657
Hey, grace...

42:07.659 --> 42:10.159
I think we should
talk about mandy.

42:10.161 --> 42:12.362
We were the last people
to see her alive.

42:12.364 --> 42:14.564
Listen, there's something
i have to tell you.

42:14.566 --> 42:15.865
I found out something

42:15.867 --> 42:18.167
Really interesting,
and now i have a theory.

42:18.169 --> 42:20.803
There is something so weird
about hag of shady lane.

42:20.805 --> 42:21.838
I'd say everything.

42:21.840 --> 42:23.339
Everything is weird
about that story.

42:23.341 --> 42:25.542
I went down to the
police headquarters

42:25.544 --> 42:27.043
To the records and
identification division.

42:27.045 --> 42:29.145
<i>The earliest reports</i>
<i>of wailing from the house</i>

42:29.147 --> 42:30.813
<i>Was november, 1995.</i>

42:30.815 --> 42:33.750
<i>But before that,</i>
<i>there's nothing, but just</i>

42:33.752 --> 42:36.219
Three weeks earlier, there
were two reported thefts.

42:36.221 --> 42:37.720
One from a convenience store

42:37.722 --> 42:39.923
About a woman in black who
came in and stole diapers,

42:39.925 --> 42:41.691
And another from a milkman

42:41.693 --> 42:43.760
<i>Who said that a woman</i>
<i>in a black robe</i>

42:43.762 --> 42:45.828
<i>Stole a crate of milk</i>
<i>from the back of his truck.</i>

42:45.830 --> 42:48.031
<i>But he couldn't get a good look</i>
<i>at her due to the, quote,</i>

42:48.033 --> 42:50.533
"all-around haggy
nature of her person."?

42:50.535 --> 42:51.734
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

42:51.736 --> 42:53.236
There were still milkmen
in 1995?

42:53.238 --> 42:58.107
Pete, this was one month
after the bathtub incident!

42:58.109 --> 43:00.410
And suddenly, the
hag of shady lane

43:00.412 --> 43:02.178
Is stealing milk
and diapers?

43:02.180 --> 43:04.547
She was taking care of a baby.

43:04.549 --> 43:05.949
<i>The</i> baby, pete.

43:05.951 --> 43:07.717
I mean, it's too
big a coincidence.

43:07.719 --> 43:09.953
I think she had
the kappa baby.

43:09.955 --> 43:12.555
I don't know how she got it,

43:12.557 --> 43:16.125
Whether she kidnapped it,
or someone gave it to her...

43:16.127 --> 43:18.561
But if we're ever gonna find
out what happened to that baby,

43:18.563 --> 43:21.531
We have to figure out
who that woman was.

43:21.533 --> 43:24.467
(wood creaking
in distance)

43:26.871 --> 43:28.538
(woman wailing, sobbing in
distance)

43:33.778 --> 43:35.311
(chair creaking,
woman sobs and wails)

43:38.316 --> 43:39.382
