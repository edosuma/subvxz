00:02.795 --> 00:05.297
(June) HALLOWEEN HAS ALWAYS

00:02.795 --> 00:05.297
BEEN MY FAVORITE HOLIDAY.

00:05.339 --> 00:08.049
IT'S THE ONE DAY OF THE YEAR

00:05.339 --> 00:08.049
WE GET TO EMBRACE OUR FEARS,

00:08.091 --> 00:09.927
NO MATTER WHAT THEY MIGHT BE

00:08.091 --> 00:09.927
OR WHO THEY MIGHT--

00:09.969 --> 00:13.054
GOD! COME ON, CHLOE.

00:13.096 --> 00:14.890
WHAT UP, DONKEY?

00:14.932 --> 00:18.226

00:14.932 --> 00:18.226

00:18.268 --> 00:22.063
HEY. DIDN'T YOU SLEEP HERE

00:27.277 --> 00:30.781
IT'S ANOTHER HOLIDAY FOR YOU TO

00:27.277 --> 00:30.781
RUIN WITH YOUR SNARKY COMMENTS.

00:30.823 --> 00:32.282

00:32.324 --> 00:34.326
I LOVE HALLOWEEN.

00:32.324 --> 00:34.326
I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT.

01:50.903 --> 01:52.320
LIFE AND HAPPINESS.

01:52.362 --> 01:55.156
ABSOLUTELY NO SCARY COSTUMES,

01:52.362 --> 01:55.156
JUST HAPPY ONES.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.617
IT ALL STARTED

01:55.198 --> 01:56.617
WHEN I WAS A KID.

01:56.658 --> 01:59.202
MY DAD PLAYED ME A VHS TAPE

01:56.658 --> 01:59.202
OF "HALLOWEEN" ON CHRISTMAS.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.371
RUINED TWO HOLIDAYS AT ONCE.

HALLOWEEN IS A... DARK TIME

02:15.218 --> 02:18.806

CANDY AND KIDS

02:28.857 --> 02:30.692
SHE SAYS THEY SEND OUT

02:28.857 --> 02:30.692
A NEGATIVE MESSAGE

02:30.734 --> 02:32.402
THAT WOMEN NEED TO BE

02:30.734 --> 02:32.402

12:03.722 --> 12:04.807
I CAN'T DO THIS.

12:04.849 --> 12:07.561
IS IT THE SONG?

12:04.849 --> 12:07.561
NO. THE SONG IS PERFECT.

12:07.602 --> 12:09.937
(turns song off)

12:07.602 --> 12:09.937
IT'S, UM...

12:09.979 --> 12:11.772
LOOK,

12:11.814 --> 12:13.774
BEN...

12:13.816 --> 12:15.776
WE HAVEN'T REALLY

12:13.816 --> 12:15.776
BEEN DATING.

12:15.818 --> 12:19.447
I'VE BEEN PLAYING

12:15.818 --> 12:19.447
A HALLOWEEN TRICK ON YOU.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.449
I'VE BEEN MAKING

12:19.489 --> 12:21.449
YOUR DEEPEST FEARS COME TRUE

12:21.491 --> 12:23.493
BY REMINDING YOU

12:21.491 --> 12:23.493
OF YOUR MOTHER

12:23.535 --> 12:25.744
AND THEN HAVING SEX WITH YOU

12:23.535 --> 12:25.744
AND DUMPING YOU.

12:27.038 --> 12:28.707
BUT I CAN'T DO IT.

12:28.747 --> 12:29.874
YOU SEEM LIKE A NICE GUY,

12:29.916 --> 12:32.835
AND THIS DOESN'T FEEL FUN

12:29.916 --> 12:32.835
ANYMORE. (sighs)

12:34.629 --> 12:36.631
(Australian accent) I KNOW.

12:36.673 --> 12:37.798
WHAT?

12:37.840 --> 12:38.883
I SAID I KNOW.

12:38.925 --> 12:41.010
ARE YOU AUSTRALIAN?

12:41.052 --> 12:42.637
YES. INDEED I AM.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.805
I'VE BEEN ONE STEP AHEAD OF YOU

12:42.679 --> 12:44.805
THIS WHOLE TIME, CHLOE.

12:44.847 --> 12:47.808
(clicks tongue) I HAVE BEEN

12:44.847 --> 12:47.808
WATCHING AND ADMIRING YOUR WORK

12:47.850 --> 12:48.809
FOR YEARS.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.062
YOU  WERE MY HYPNOTIST?

12:51.104 --> 12:53.856
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO

12:51.104 --> 12:53.856
HELP ME QUIT SMOKING.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.651
YOU  WERE MY NUTRITIONIST?

12:56.693 --> 12:58.653
YEAH, THE LOVE SCENES

12:56.693 --> 12:58.653
WERE A CHALLENGE.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.029
WHAT'S THAT GIRL'S DEAL?

13:00.071 --> 13:02.198
WHAT, CHLOE?

13:02.240 --> 13:04.033
OH. (laughs)

13:02.240 --> 13:04.033
HER IDEA OF A HALLOWEEN TRICK

13:04.075 --> 13:06.494
IS TO COMPLETELY RUIN

13:04.075 --> 13:06.494
SOMEBODY'S LIFE.

13:06.536 --> 13:07.662
YOU KNOW,

13:06.536 --> 13:07.662
SHE'S ONE OF THE PEOPLE

13:07.704 --> 13:08.996
WHO TOLD ME

13:07.704 --> 13:08.996
NOT TO DO "LOVE MONSTER."

13:09.038 --> 13:10.915
SHE ABSOLUTELY HATES

13:09.038 --> 13:10.915
CHICK FLICKS.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.042
GOT IT.

13:13.084 --> 13:15.503
THE MOMENT YOU STARTED

13:13.084 --> 13:15.503
BEING NICE TO ME THAT NIGHT,

13:15.545 --> 13:17.714
I REALIZED

13:15.545 --> 13:17.714
I WAS YOUR NEXT TARGET,

13:17.756 --> 13:19.466
SO THEN I STARTED

13:17.756 --> 13:19.466
MY  HALLOWEEN TRICK

13:19.507 --> 13:22.927
OF MAKING  YOUR  BIGGEST FEARS

13:19.507 --> 13:22.927
COME TRUE...

13:22.969 --> 13:25.012
BY FORCING YOU

13:22.969 --> 13:25.012
TO LIVE A CHICK FLICK.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.514
THAT IS MY BIGGEST FEAR.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.514
YEAH.

13:26.556 --> 13:27.848
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

13:27.890 --> 13:29.016
THINK ABOUT IT.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.016
WHEN I TOLD YOU

13:29.058 --> 13:31.436
THAT MY MOTHER WALKED ON ME,

13:29.058 --> 13:31.436
WHERE WERE WE?

13:31.478 --> 13:33.896
ON A CARRIAGE RIDE

13:31.478 --> 13:33.896
IN CENTRAL PARK.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.440
AND WHEN I TOLD YOU

13:35.482 --> 13:37.150
I HAD TROUBLE

13:35.482 --> 13:37.150
TRUSTING WOMEN AFTER THAT?

13:37.191 --> 13:39.860
WE WERE HAVING

13:37.191 --> 13:39.860
A GOOD-NATURED SNOWBALL FIGHT.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.571
DON'T YOU SEE?

13:41.613 --> 13:44.491
THIS WHOLE TIME I'VE BEEN

13:41.613 --> 13:44.491
"REVEALING" MYSELF TO YOU,

13:44.532 --> 13:48.077
WE WERE ACTING OUT

13:44.532 --> 13:48.077
CHICK FLICK CLICHES.

13:48.119 --> 13:49.870
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOTHER?

13:49.912 --> 13:51.581
SPOKE TO HER YESTERDAY.

13:49.912 --> 13:51.581
SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

13:51.623 --> 13:54.083
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING

13:51.623 --> 13:54.083
A TRIP TO LAOS TOGETHER.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.877
SO  YOU  WERE THE ONE

13:54.125 --> 13:56.877
TRICKING  ME?

13:56.919 --> 13:58.463
OH, IT'S NOT OVER.

13:58.505 --> 13:59.880
WE'RE ONLY AT THE END

13:58.505 --> 13:59.880
OF ACT TWO--

13:59.922 --> 14:01.882
YOU REALIZING THAT YOU CARE

13:59.922 --> 14:01.882
TOO MUCH ABOUT ME

14:01.924 --> 14:03.884
TO GO THROUGH

14:01.924 --> 14:03.884
WITH YOUR TRICK.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.929
YOU'VE DEVELOPED REAL FEELINGS

14:03.926 --> 14:06.929
FOR ME.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.929
NO, I HAVEN'T.

14:06.971 --> 14:09.932
WELL, I'M FLYING OUT OF

14:06.971 --> 14:09.932
LaGUARDIA AT NOON TOMORROW

14:09.974 --> 14:12.352
TO SHOOT A NEW MOVIE

14:09.974 --> 14:12.352
IN PRAGUE.

14:12.393 --> 14:15.896
WHO KNOWS IF WE'LL EVER

14:12.393 --> 14:15.896
SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN.

14:15.938 --> 14:16.939
UNLESS...

14:16.981 --> 14:19.984
YOU CHASE ME DOWN

14:16.981 --> 14:19.984
IN THE AIRPORT

14:20.026 --> 14:22.195
AND MAKE A HEARTFELT PLEA

14:20.026 --> 14:22.195
FOR LOVE.

14:24.947 --> 14:28.868
GOOD LUCK

14:24.947 --> 14:28.868
NOT  MEETING ME THERE.

14:32.831 --> 14:35.500
HAPPY HALLOWEEN.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.918
IS THIS EVEN YOUR HOUSE?

14:37.960 --> 14:40.087
NOPE. A FURNISHED RENTAL.

14:40.129 --> 14:41.464
(door slams)

14:45.635 --> 14:47.387
BENJAMIN WAS TRICKING YOU?

14:47.428 --> 14:48.971
I CANNOT BELIEVE HE BEAT ME

14:47.428 --> 14:48.971
AT MY OWN GAME.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.931
FORCING ME TO LIVE

14:49.013 --> 14:50.931
IN A CHICK FLICK?!

14:50.973 --> 14:53.934
NO, THAT--THAT IS NOT TRUE.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.934
I AM THE QUEEN OF CHICK FLICKS.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.937
(rattling)

14:53.976 --> 14:56.937
I KNOW EVERY BEAT.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.937
IF THIS  WERE  A CHICK FLICK--

14:56.979 --> 14:58.939
YOU'D BE THE QUIRKY,

14:56.979 --> 14:58.939
UNLUCKY-IN-LOVE BEST FRIEND.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.941
WHAT?

14:58.981 --> 15:00.941
YOU GIVE ADVICE

14:58.981 --> 15:00.941
TO THE MAIN CHARACTER,

15:00.983 --> 15:03.737
YOU PUT ASIDE YOUR OWN AGENDA

15:00.983 --> 15:03.737
TO SERVICE HERS.

15:03.778 --> 15:06.322
NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY

15:03.778 --> 15:06.322
BENJAMIN'S FRIEND WAS SO GROSS.

15:06.364 --> 15:07.824
FOR THIS.

15:07.866 --> 15:08.949
FOR YOU.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.117
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:10.159 --> 15:13.162
ZONK IS THE GUY THAT YOU END UP

15:10.159 --> 15:13.162
WITH IN THE MOVIE.

15:13.204 --> 15:15.956
HE'S THE JONAH HILL/JIM BELUSHI/

15:13.204 --> 15:15.956
ZACH GALIFIANAKIS

15:15.998 --> 15:20.002
TO YOUR JOAN CUSACK/LISA KUDROW/

15:15.998 --> 15:20.002
JANEANE GAROFALO.

15:20.044 --> 15:24.131
I AM  NOT

15:20.044 --> 15:24.131
THE SUPPORTING PLAYER.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.592
AM I?

15:25.633 --> 15:27.009
I CAN'T GO TO THE AIRPORT

15:25.633 --> 15:27.009
BECAUSE THEN BENJAMIN WILL WIN!

15:27.051 --> 15:29.763
BUT IF I DON'T GO, THEN HE WILL

15:27.051 --> 15:29.763
HAVE HAD THE LAST CON,

15:29.804 --> 15:31.972
AND HE STILL WINS!

15:29.804 --> 15:31.972
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

15:32.014 --> 15:33.057
I SUDDENLY HAVE

15:32.014 --> 15:33.057
THE URGE TO BAKE.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.976
I WANT TO PUT ON SWEATPANTS

15:33.099 --> 15:35.976
AND BAKE, FOR SOME REASON.

15:36.018 --> 15:38.020
OH, GOD.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.189
TURN IT ON, JUNE.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.189
(sobs)

15:41.649 --> 15:42.901
TAKE IT OFF.

15:41.649 --> 15:42.901
NO.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.485
TAKE IT OFF.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.485
I'LL TAKE OFF MY COSTUME

15:44.527 --> 15:46.987
IF YOU TAKE OFF YOUR FEAR.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.072
UM, OKAY.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.909
SO I'M GONNA GO.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.993
YOU KNOW WHO THAT WAS?

15:50.950 --> 15:52.993
(door opens and closes)

15:53.035 --> 15:54.454
THAT WAS

15:53.035 --> 15:54.454
THE LAST GIRL STANDING.

15:54.495 --> 15:56.289
SHE WAS WAITING FOR YOU TO LEAVE

15:54.495 --> 15:56.289
SO SHE COULD HAVE SEX WITH ME,

15:56.330 --> 15:57.998
BUT YOU NEVER DID.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.000
SO NOW CHEYENNE HAS TO GO BACK

15:58.040 --> 16:00.000
TO WORK AT THE PHARMACY

16:00.042 --> 16:02.002
HAVING NOT HAD SEX

16:00.042 --> 16:02.002
WITH A TV STAR.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.631
YOU RUINED HER LIFE

16:02.044 --> 16:04.631
AND MY PARTY.

16:04.672 --> 16:06.925
YOU RUINED YOUR PARTY.

16:04.672 --> 16:06.925
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, MAN?

16:06.966 --> 16:09.051
WHAT IS UNDERNEATH

16:06.966 --> 16:09.051
THIS FEAR OF HALLOWEEN?

16:09.093 --> 16:10.428
I JUST THINK IT'S SCARY.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.012
YES,

16:10.470 --> 16:12.012
BUT WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THAT?

16:12.054 --> 16:13.681
NOTHING.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.681
I JUST DON'T LIKE SCARY STUFF.

16:13.723 --> 16:16.434
MAYBE  YOU  WERE THE ONE

16:13.723 --> 16:16.434
AVOIDING THAT SEXY BUNNY GIRL.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.018
BECAUSE MAYBE YOU'D HIT IT OFF

16:18.060 --> 16:19.604
AND YOU'D GO OUT ON A DATE

16:18.060 --> 16:19.604
WITH HER

16:19.646 --> 16:21.397
AND YOU'D EVENTUALLY

16:19.646 --> 16:21.397
MOVE IN TOGETHER TOO SOON

16:21.439 --> 16:23.232
BECAUSE HER PARENTS COSIGNED

16:23.274 --> 16:25.318
ON AN APARTMENT

16:23.274 --> 16:25.318
IN THE MEATPACKING DISTRICT

16:25.359 --> 16:27.027
WITH NOT ENOUGH ROOM

16:25.359 --> 16:27.027
FOR YOUR RECORDS

16:27.069 --> 16:29.739
AND HER MADAME ALEXANDER

16:27.069 --> 16:29.739
DOLL COLLECTION!

16:29.781 --> 16:33.493
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU.

16:29.781 --> 16:33.493
YEAH, I DON'T LOVE

16:29.781 --> 16:33.493
MY GIRLFRIEND!

16:39.582 --> 16:40.917
I WIN.

16:40.959 --> 16:45.045
MARIO DOESN'T LIKE TO HOLD HANDS

16:40.959 --> 16:45.045
ON THE SUBWAY.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.506
I DON'T KNOW.

16:46.547 --> 16:49.717
I JUST...

16:46.547 --> 16:49.717
(clicks tongue) I DON'T KNOW.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.553
I MEAN, WE'LL SEE,

16:52.595 --> 16:54.639
BUT... I DON'T KNOW.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.766
(cell phone rings)

16:59.268 --> 17:01.103
MARK, WHERE ARE YOU?

16:59.268 --> 17:01.103
WE ARE SLAMMED.

17:01.145 --> 17:05.065
IT IS THE POST-HALLOWEEN,

17:01.145 --> 17:05.065
HUNGOVER, WALK-OF-SHAME CROWD.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.985
I JUST HAD

17:05.107 --> 17:06.985
A PRETTY INTENSE REALIZATION.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.444
CAN YOU COVER FOR ME?

17:08.486 --> 17:10.070
YEAH, IT'S NOT LIKE

17:08.486 --> 17:10.070
I'VE GOT ANYTHING GOING ON

17:08.486 --> 17:10.070
IN MY OWN LIFE--

17:10.112 --> 17:12.365
GOOD. THANKS. BYE.

17:10.112 --> 17:12.365
(sighs)

17:12.406 --> 17:14.492
NO ONE CARES WHAT'S GOING ON

17:12.406 --> 17:14.492
IN MY LIFE.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.076
I WANTED TO GET

17:14.534 --> 17:16.076
A GUY'S PHONE NUMBER,

17:16.118 --> 17:18.538
AND I WALKED AWAY FROM

17:16.118 --> 17:18.538
A CUTE FIREMAN JUST TO HELP--

17:18.579 --> 17:20.373
(Zonk snorts and swallows)

17:20.414 --> 17:21.875
AHH.

17:21.916 --> 17:26.462
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO

17:21.916 --> 17:26.462
WITH THOSE TWO, HUH?

17:26.504 --> 17:28.715
NOPE. NO, ZONK,

17:26.504 --> 17:28.715
I'M NOT DOING THIS.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.967
I AM NOT GONNA BE

17:28.756 --> 17:30.967
THE QUIRKY BEST FRIEND

17:31.009 --> 17:33.386
WHO IS MORE INVOLVED WITH

17:31.009 --> 17:33.386
CHLOE'S LOVE LIFE THAN MY OWN.

17:33.427 --> 17:36.305
BUT I HAVE INFO

17:33.427 --> 17:36.305
THAT COULD CHANGE EVERYTHING.

17:36.347 --> 17:38.391
BENJAMIN'S NOT GONNA DIRECT

17:36.347 --> 17:38.391
"LOVE MONSTER 2."

17:38.432 --> 17:41.895
HE BACKED OUT BECAUSE OF

17:38.432 --> 17:41.895
CHLOE'S HATRED OF CHICK FLICKS.

17:41.936 --> 17:44.480
DON'T YOU GET IT?

17:41.936 --> 17:44.480
HE REALLY DOES LIKE HER.

17:44.522 --> 17:46.399
THIS WASN'T ALL JUST A SCAM.

17:46.440 --> 17:49.944
THAT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

17:49.986 --> 17:51.654
(whispers) EXCEPT EVERYTHING.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.328
ZONK JUST TOLD ME

17:57.076 --> 17:59.328
THAT BENJAMIN TURNED DOWN

17:59.370 --> 18:01.414
DIRECTING "LOVE MONSTER 2"

17:59.370 --> 18:01.414
BECAUSE OF YOU.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.123
I MEAN, DON'T YOU GET IT?

18:03.165 --> 18:05.167
HE REALLY LIKES YOU.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.167
YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE AIRPORT.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.127
YEAH. I KNOW.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.127
I'M ON MY WAY THERE NOW.

18:07.169 --> 18:08.170
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU KNOW?

18:08.212 --> 18:09.213
I TALKED TO A BEE.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.213
A WHAT?

18:09.255 --> 18:10.798
A  BUMBLEBEE.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.132
(Chloe) I WAS GOING OUT

18:10.840 --> 18:12.132
TO GET FLOUR AND EGGS

18:12.174 --> 18:13.342
FOR MY SUDDEN BAKING URGE,

18:13.384 --> 18:15.970
FURIOUS ABOUT BEING CONNED

18:13.384 --> 18:15.970
BY BENJAMIN,

18:16.012 --> 18:18.305
WHEN I FELL INTO STEP

18:16.012 --> 18:18.305
WITH THIS BEE.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.224
SHE NOTICED I LOOKED

18:18.347 --> 18:20.224
WELL RESTED,

18:20.266 --> 18:22.309
NOT HUNGOVER, AND THAT

18:20.266 --> 18:22.309
I SMELLED OF DEODORANT,

18:22.351 --> 18:24.144
WHICH MEANS I MUST'VE SLEPT

18:22.351 --> 18:24.144
AT MY OWN PLACE,

18:24.186 --> 18:26.355
WHICH IS UNUSUAL

18:24.186 --> 18:26.355
FOR HALLOWEEN NIGHT.

18:26.397 --> 18:29.442
SHE ASKED ME, POINTING AT

18:26.397 --> 18:29.442
MY HEART, "WHO GOT IN THERE?"

18:29.483 --> 18:32.028
I WAS TAKEN ABACK THAT

18:29.483 --> 18:32.028
SHE COULD READ ME SO QUICKLY,

18:32.070 --> 18:34.614
SO I ASKED IF SHE WANTED

18:32.070 --> 18:34.614
TO GRAB A CUP OF COFFEE.

18:34.655 --> 18:36.240
WELL, I GOT A COFFEE.

18:36.282 --> 18:38.158
THE BEE ATE

18:36.282 --> 18:38.158
A FULL LUMBERJACK MEAL.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.535
GIRLFRIEND WAS FAMISHED.

18:39.577 --> 18:43.039
ANYWAY, SHE MADE ME REALIZE WHY

18:39.577 --> 18:43.039
CHICK FLICKS ARE SO POPULAR.

18:43.081 --> 18:46.042
BECAUSE DEEP DOWN, EVERYONE,

18:43.081 --> 18:46.042
NO MATTER HOW CYNICAL,

18:46.084 --> 18:47.418
WANTS A HAPPY ENDING.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.263
SHE TOLD ME THAT THE ONLY WAY

18:56.636 --> 18:59.263
OUT OF A CHICK FLICK

18:59.305 --> 19:01.057
IS THROUGH IT,

19:01.099 --> 19:03.434
THAT IT'S NOT WHETHER I GO

19:01.099 --> 19:03.434
TO THE AIRPORT OR NOT,

19:03.476 --> 19:07.271
IT'S WHAT I DO WHEN I GET THERE

19:03.476 --> 19:07.271
THAT MATTERS.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.189
SO I'M ON MY WAY

19:07.313 --> 19:09.189
TO THE AIRPORT NOW.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.191
WAIT. SO I DIDN'T HELP YOU

19:09.231 --> 19:11.191
AT ALL?

19:11.233 --> 19:14.487
WELL, I LIKE TO BE ON THE PHONE

19:11.233 --> 19:14.487
WHEN I HAIL A CAB, SO KINDA.

19:14.528 --> 19:18.198
WOW. I AM SO GLAD SOMEBODY ELSE

19:14.528 --> 19:18.198
HELPED YOU FIGURE THIS OUT.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.701
MAYBE I'M NOT JUST

19:18.240 --> 19:20.701
THE SUPPORTING PLAYER AFTER ALL.

19:20.743 --> 19:21.869
(cell phone alert chimes)

19:26.040 --> 19:29.293
("PM's Love Theme"

19:26.040 --> 19:29.293
from "Love Actually" playing)

19:35.299 --> 19:39.345
(woman over P.A.) CHLOE, PLEASE

19:35.299 --> 19:39.345
PICK UP A WHITE COURTESY PHONE.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.388
HELLO?

19:41.430 --> 19:43.182
(Benjamin) I KNEW YOU'D COME.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.397
I HAD TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

19:50.439 --> 19:51.607
I LIKE YOU.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.400
(laughs) YEAH. RIGHT.

19:53.442 --> 19:54.401
(receiver clatters)

19:54.443 --> 19:56.487
NO, I REALLY DO.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.073
YES, IT STARTED OUT

19:56.529 --> 19:59.073
AS A TRICK,

19:59.115 --> 20:00.741
UNTIL I REALIZED THAT

19:59.115 --> 20:00.741
YOU WERE MESSING WITH ME,

20:00.783 --> 20:03.202
AND NO ONE'S EVER BEAT ME

20:00.783 --> 20:03.202
AT MY OWN GAME BEFORE.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.246
I LIKE YOU.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.916
I...

20:10.292 --> 20:11.752
I CAN'T TELL

20:10.292 --> 20:11.752
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

20:11.794 --> 20:13.253
I KNOW.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.548
YOU'RE WONDERING,

20:13.295 --> 20:15.548
IS SHE STILL MESSING WITH ME

20:15.589 --> 20:17.257
OR IS SHE FINALLY

20:15.589 --> 20:17.257
BEING HONEST?

20:17.299 --> 20:19.468
BECAUSE MAYBE HER BIGGEST FEAR

20:17.299 --> 20:19.468
ISN'T BEING IN A CHICK FLICK

20:19.510 --> 20:21.679
BUT ACTUALLY HAVING FEELINGS

20:19.510 --> 20:21.679
FOR SOMEONE.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.182
THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW,

20:24.223 --> 20:26.266
WHICH MEANS I WIN.

20:26.308 --> 20:29.311
WELL, I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA

20:26.308 --> 20:29.311
REPORT ME AS A TERRORIST,

20:29.353 --> 20:33.273
SO I TOLD T.S.A. YOU HAVE

20:29.353 --> 20:33.273
A SWITCHBLADE IN YOUR PURSE.

20:33.315 --> 20:34.441
BUT I DON'T.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.110
YOU DO.

20:37.111 --> 20:39.238
(click)

20:40.406 --> 20:42.282
COME ON.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.282
(police radio chatter)

20:42.324 --> 20:45.285
WAIT. I'M CONFUSED.

20:42.324 --> 20:45.285
SO--SO YOU LIKE ME?

20:45.327 --> 20:47.287
DO I?

20:47.329 --> 20:49.498
YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA

20:47.329 --> 20:49.498
SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN, RIGHT?

20:49.540 --> 20:51.375
THIS ISN'T THE END

20:49.540 --> 20:51.375
OF OUR STORY.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.459
I KNOW.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.420
SEE YOU IN THE SEQUEL.

20:56.338 --> 20:57.757
OH, PLEASE. THE SEQUEL'S NEVER

20:56.338 --> 20:57.757
AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL.

20:57.798 --> 21:00.134
MIND YOUR OWN WEAVE-WAX,

20:57.798 --> 21:00.134
SWEETIE.

20:57.798 --> 21:00.134
(door slams)

21:04.430 --> 21:05.890
EXCUSE ME.

21:05.932 --> 21:08.226
I'VE BEEN

21:05.932 --> 21:08.226
TO EVERY FIREHOUSE IN MANHATTAN.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.311
I'M TRYING TO FIND THIS CUTE

21:08.267 --> 21:11.311
FIREMAN THAT I MET ON HALLOWEEN.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.480
(pole squeaks)

21:13.522 --> 21:15.524
'SUP?

21:15.566 --> 21:16.316
NO!

21:16.358 --> 21:18.694
GOD! I DON'T BELIEVE THIS!

21:18.736 --> 21:19.779
BELIEVE IT.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.321
THIS IS HAPPENING.

21:21.363 --> 21:24.366
ARE YOU EVEN IN SHAPE ENOUGH

21:21.363 --> 21:24.366
TO BE A FIREMAN?

21:24.408 --> 21:25.367
I'M THE COOK.

21:25.409 --> 21:29.247
FRANKLIN ZONKOWSKI,

21:25.409 --> 21:29.247
FIREHOUSE CHEF.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.916
THEY LET ME SLIDE DOWN THE POLE

21:29.288 --> 21:31.916
WHEN I GOT A BITCH TO IMPRESS.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.333
UGH.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.086
THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
