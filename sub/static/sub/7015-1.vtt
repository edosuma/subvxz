00:25.658 --> 00:26.443
What?

00:26.470 --> 00:29.213
I'm starting to notice something about you.

00:29.398 --> 00:31.448
You're still here!

00:32.390 --> 00:34.547
What your father means is

00:34.898 --> 00:38.065
you haven't seemed like yourself
since you called off the wedding.

00:38.093 --> 00:40.254
No, what I mean is...

00:40.281 --> 00:41.620
get out!

00:42.137 --> 00:46.210
Well, I'm sorry. It's only been a week.
It was kind of traumatic, you know?

00:46.237 --> 00:48.055
Last night I only slept, like,

00:48.092 --> 00:49.662
nine hours.

00:51.075 --> 00:53.881
Honey, we just..we want
to know what your plans are.

00:53.909 --> 00:56.281
I would have waited until
next week to ask you,

00:56.309 --> 01:01.480
but apparently some people agree to things
and then just do whatever they want.

01:01.950 --> 01:04.943
I've got some questions, I want answers.

01:04.971 --> 01:07.049
What are you doing about moving out?

01:07.224 --> 01:08.462
I don't know.

01:08.850 --> 01:10.170
About Donna?

01:10.203 --> 01:11.330
I don't know.

01:11.365 --> 01:13.006
Your job?

01:13.734 --> 01:15.014
I don't know.

01:15.942 --> 01:17.327
Your future?

01:17.351 --> 01:21.132
Okay, i'm gonna go ahead
and hit you with an...

01:21.494 --> 01:22.750
I don't know.

01:23.431 --> 01:25.498
Then no food for you.

01:26.214 --> 01:26.836
What?

01:26.857 --> 01:30.251
Red, he's so skinny.
Just take away his car.

01:31.296 --> 01:32.306
No.

01:32.364 --> 01:34.640
I'm trying to teach the boy responsibility.

01:34.675 --> 01:38.303
I want a plan out of you
by tonight or no dinner, either.

01:38.338 --> 01:40.931
Dad, that's no...
Wait, mom, what's for dinner?

01:42.234 --> 01:44.617
- Fried chicken.
- Oh, come on!

01:45.510 --> 01:46.823
Steven?

01:47.269 --> 01:49.453
- When are you moving out?
- Soon.

01:49.488 --> 01:51.942
- How's your girlfriend?
- Shallow as hell.

01:52.903 --> 01:54.089
- Job?
- Dead end.

01:54.112 --> 01:55.228
- Future?
- Bleak.

01:55.275 --> 01:56.895
Kitty, feed the boy.

02:37.588 --> 02:40.621
Donna, you hair is
gonna look so fabulous.

02:40.655 --> 02:43.105
It's weird.
I actually feel different.

02:43.138 --> 02:46.746
Well, now that you're not getting married
you have to re-energize yourself spiritually

02:46.779 --> 02:49.823
And making superficial changes,
this is the best way to do that.

02:51.623 --> 02:54.006
- Hello..
- Beurk.

02:54.956 --> 02:57.556
Oh, come on..
A sweater vest?

02:58.906 --> 03:02.706
Jackie, if you don't have anything nice
to say, just don't say anything at all.

03:02.739 --> 03:06.238
Well, if I followed that rule
I'd never speak again!

03:07.290 --> 03:08.996
Yeah, it's kinda the idea.

03:09.018 --> 03:11.076
Okay, okay, I'm going.

03:12.180 --> 03:14.880
You look like
a circus poodle!

03:17.120 --> 03:19.503
Hey, So uh...

03:19.987 --> 03:22.887
Look, I think we need to talk.. about..

03:23.153 --> 03:25.920
us.. since the..

03:26.286 --> 03:30.070
Matrimonial incident. I mean,
we've seen each other but..

03:30.120 --> 03:31.686
We haven't really
talked about anything.

03:31.720 --> 03:33.703
Yeah but it's
been nice right?

03:33.903 --> 03:35.903
I mean I'm sick of
talking about us..

03:35.953 --> 03:39.020
And I'm not mad because you were right.
I mean, we were about to make...

03:39.053 --> 03:40.670
A huge mistake.

03:40.770 --> 03:43.453
I can't live in a trailer with you.

03:44.903 --> 03:47.746
I'd hear you going to the bathroom.

03:48.079 --> 03:49.946
Yes, I had thought about that.

03:49.979 --> 03:52.929
I was only gonna go in a bottle
after you were asleep, so...

03:54.229 --> 03:57.843
See, remember when our relationship
was the most fun thing in our lives?

03:57.927 --> 04:00.160
And now we put all
this pressure on it.

04:00.193 --> 04:03.927
I wish we could just, you know
hang out without all that stuff.

04:06.460 --> 04:08.793
Holy mother of God.

04:09.060 --> 04:10.510
Do you like it?

04:10.560 --> 04:12.777
Are you kidding, yes!

04:12.827 --> 04:15.560
It's good. I think it's like a sign that you're..

04:15.610 --> 04:16.843
Loosening up,

04:16.910 --> 04:20.827
Like maybe now you might like that
thing I try in bed that makes you mad.

04:21.976 --> 04:23.343
I won't.

04:24.527 --> 04:26.238
I'll still try.

04:26.605 --> 04:30.230
See, this is great. Your perviness
is our biggest problem now.

04:30.263 --> 04:34.385
- Just like the old days.
- Yes, exactly.

04:34.502 --> 04:36.535
See, we should just hang out.

04:36.602 --> 04:37.818
You know,

04:37.918 --> 04:39.585
Get back in touch with ourselves

04:39.618 --> 04:41.635
- That sounds dirty. Is it dirty?
- No,

04:41.701 --> 04:45.118
I'm serious. I have a plan.

04:45.151 --> 04:48.951
You have a plan? Perfect.
I need a plan. What's your plan?

04:48.985 --> 04:51.522
I'm gonna deejay at
the radio station full-time

04:51.568 --> 04:54.002
And rededicate myself to feminism.

04:54.052 --> 04:55.818
At the radio station?

04:55.868 --> 04:59.268
Is that... What, are you
gonna play more heart?

04:59.701 --> 05:01.535
And other stuff.

05:01.851 --> 05:03.835
Maybe some benatar.

05:03.901 --> 05:04.691
Wow.

05:04.733 --> 05:07.645
Whatever. I'm blonde now.
I can do what I want.

05:14.469 --> 05:16.198
Hello.

05:16.365 --> 05:17.573
Oh-ho,

05:17.927 --> 05:19.823
What are you doing
With that sandwich?

05:19.861 --> 05:22.931
I thought that we established
That you needed a plan.

05:22.971 --> 05:25.744
Oh, i've got a plan.

05:26.037 --> 05:29.317
Donna is gonna work full-time
At the radio station and

05:29.356 --> 05:31.623
Rededicate herself to feminism.

05:33.023 --> 05:34.476
Feminists...

05:34.530 --> 05:38.279
Equal pay's fine, but
Put a little lipstick on.

05:41.173 --> 05:42.293
Whatever.

05:42.333 --> 05:44.866
Anyway, that's the plan.
We came up with it this morning.

05:44.893 --> 05:46.933
That's Donna's plan.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.240
What's your plan?

05:49.520 --> 05:51.226
My plan...

05:52.053 --> 05:54.436
Is to support Donna's plan.

05:56.183 --> 05:58.330
Thought you had
me there, didn't you?

05:59.756 --> 06:01.876
- Get out.
- Fine,

06:01.956 --> 06:03.489
But know this....

06:03.943 --> 06:06.610
I will have my fried chicken.

06:11.660 --> 06:13.780
How come you're making
So many sandwiches?

06:13.887 --> 06:15.607
Bulking up for the winter?

06:19.780 --> 06:20.967
No, no, no,

06:21.300 --> 06:23.993
I... I didn't mean it like that.

06:24.527 --> 06:26.407
No, see, it's like

06:26.447 --> 06:28.114
You're the mama bear,

06:28.140 --> 06:30.247
And i'm the papa bear.

06:30.274 --> 06:32.034
We're bears.

06:34.087 --> 06:36.127
Fine. We're not bears.

06:39.260 --> 06:40.834
I'm sorry.

06:42.406 --> 06:50.019
I made so many sandwiches, not because
I am a fat prehibernation bear,

06:50.295 --> 06:56.895
But because Bob is coming over for lunch, and since
He is still dating Pam and Midge like some kind of gigolo,

06:56.945 --> 07:00.497
I didn't know how much food I would need.

07:01.480 --> 07:05.764
Hey, everybody, I think you know
My date and former wife Midge.

07:05.814 --> 07:07.847
Bob, they know me.

07:07.930 --> 07:10.330
It's me. Midge!

07:10.930 --> 07:13.496
So does this mean you two
are back together?

07:13.530 --> 07:19.246
Well, we've been talking things over, and
We're pretty close to working things out.

07:20.096 --> 07:22.113
What is going on here?

07:22.146 --> 07:25.129
- Pam!
- Back off. He's mine.

07:25.763 --> 07:29.680
That is not what you said
To me in bed last night.

07:29.713 --> 07:34.130
Well, you should have heard what
He said to me last night in the hot tub.

07:35.780 --> 07:40.189
You told me that you got up
To get an ice cream cone

07:44.539 --> 07:48.206
I don't know why you're upset.
I wasn't gone that long.

07:55.079 --> 07:59.995
All right! Eric traded in
Donna for a hot blonde.

08:01.049 --> 08:02.749
Oh, crap!

08:05.032 --> 08:07.432
She looks exactly like Donna!

08:09.082 --> 08:11.115
It is Donna, you ding-dong,

08:11.865 --> 08:15.122
Only now she lets Forman do
that thing he's been trying.

08:15.556 --> 08:17.572
- Eric!
- Hyde...

08:18.522 --> 08:20.289
I said maybe.

08:22.972 --> 08:26.165
Your hair is beautiful.
I want to touch it.

08:29.365 --> 08:31.515
Hey, I can do this all day.

08:31.698 --> 08:33.398
Okay, fine.

08:36.847 --> 08:37.914
What, you don't like it?

08:37.931 --> 08:42.100
I like my women like I like my wine--
Red and full of alcohol.

08:43.034 --> 08:46.600
Whatever. When I was a redhead, at the
bakery, they'd give me a free doughnut.

08:46.667 --> 08:48.450
But as a blonde...

08:48.484 --> 08:50.300
Apple fritter.

08:50.884 --> 08:53.001
So i'm gonna stay blonde for awhile,

08:53.084 --> 08:55.067
And i'm gonna go to the bakery.

08:57.167 --> 08:59.034
You're a lucky man, Forman.

08:59.084 --> 09:00.701
Not only is Donna not mad,

09:00.751 --> 09:04.951
But as a bonus, she's fixed
herself up all whorey.

09:06.034 --> 09:08.268
And I have an announcement.

09:08.321 --> 09:11.288
Donna and I have decided we're not
talking about our relationship anymore.

09:11.321 --> 09:13.405
- Hooray!
- Bravo!
- Mazel tov!

09:13.971 --> 09:18.138
Finally, we'll have some time to talk
about things that I want to talk about.

09:18.188 --> 09:20.888
Number one... Cocoa butter.

09:21.555 --> 09:25.088
It doesn't taste like cocoa or butter.

09:26.005 --> 09:29.972
It's gonna be so great to be with Donna
without all the talking and the decisions

09:30.005 --> 09:33.355
And the labels. You know, am I your fiancé?
You know, am I your boyfriend?

09:33.405 --> 09:36.594
Hey, wait a minute. Are you and Donna
boyfriend and girlfriend or not?

09:36.627 --> 09:39.044
No, i'm saying why put labels on it?

09:39.077 --> 09:42.110
Are you dating, or can
You see other people?

09:42.144 --> 09:43.477
Why are you so interested?

09:43.527 --> 09:46.662
- He's trying to figure out if he can nail Donna.
- Hyde!

09:47.627 --> 09:50.627
Let me build up to it. Damn!

09:52.627 --> 09:54.094
So can I?

09:55.150 --> 09:56.283
No.

09:56.833 --> 09:59.000
Thanks for nothing, Hyde.

09:59.716 --> 10:03.250
Eric, you really got it made with Donna..
No responsibilities, no plans.

10:03.300 --> 10:05.284
What a great way to live your life.

10:05.334 --> 10:08.218
You know what? That is
a great way to live your life.

10:09.351 --> 10:13.101
Hey, you know what, you guys? I've figured
out what i'm gonna do this year.

10:13.168 --> 10:17.118
You're gonna be the first person
to put on my human firecracker suit.

10:17.301 --> 10:20.368
No, I'm talking... Wait,
what is a firecracker suit?

10:20.418 --> 10:23.051
Right, so it's this suit that--

10:23.118 --> 10:24.118
Wait.

10:24.168 --> 10:26.535
You have to agree
to wear it before I tell you.

10:28.818 --> 10:31.118
I'm intrigued. We'll talk more later.

10:31.568 --> 10:35.640
You guys, my dad said I had to have
a plan this year, and now I have it.

10:35.990 --> 10:38.723
I'm gonna take the year off.

10:41.790 --> 10:44.957
Isn't that what Elvis said right
before he died on the toilet?

10:45.693 --> 10:48.693
No, you guys, seriously,
look, rich kids do it, right?

10:48.743 --> 10:53.593
After high school, they take a year off, go to Europe,
figure out what they're gonna do. I'm gonna do exactly that..

10:53.660 --> 10:56.410
Just go nowhere and do nothing.

10:57.710 --> 10:59.060
So you're gonna be a bum.

10:59.093 --> 11:02.610
In the grandest European tradition, yes!

11:02.660 --> 11:08.811
Hey, why not? He's young, he's got a free place
to live, a girl that's way too hot for him.

11:09.727 --> 11:12.475
Ride the ride, baby.

11:12.859 --> 11:14.175
Exactly.

11:14.242 --> 11:16.475
You know, this whole marriage
thing has made me think,

11:16.525 --> 11:18.825
Why am I in such a hurry to grow up?

11:18.875 --> 11:20.175
You know, life

11:20.392 --> 11:23.625
Is like a train. It's bearing down
on you, and guess what.

11:23.675 --> 11:25.642
It's gonna hit you.

11:26.575 --> 11:32.082
So you can either start running when it's far off in the
distance, or you can pull up a chair, crack open a beer

11:32.115 --> 11:34.449
And just watch it come.

11:39.715 --> 11:41.632
I did that once.

11:42.103 --> 11:45.003
No, Kelso, not a real train.

11:45.053 --> 11:49.286
- No, a metaphorical one.
- Like a.. Like a ghost train?

11:52.887 --> 11:53.937
Yes.

11:55.620 --> 11:57.520
A ghost train.

11:59.387 --> 12:01.353
You know, I tell you, Red,

12:01.503 --> 12:04.337
I don't like this situation
With Bob and two women.

12:04.387 --> 12:08.587
I have put up with a lot of weird things
In this neighborhood... Hot tubs,

12:08.637 --> 12:10.270
Wife swapping,

12:10.304 --> 12:11.954
Jogging.

12:12.787 --> 12:16.237
Now I am drawing the line. You have
To make Bob choose one woman.

12:16.287 --> 12:19.006
Well, the choice is obvious.. Pam.

12:19.606 --> 12:22.873
Red, this isn't your decision. It's his,

12:22.940 --> 12:25.540
And he has to pick Midge.

12:26.223 --> 12:28.890
But Pam is so tan.

12:28.990 --> 12:33.607
But, Red, if Bob picks Midge,
he will reunite a shattered family,

12:33.640 --> 12:38.590
Bringing their only daughter a glimpse
of happiness for the first time in her life.

12:38.657 --> 12:41.037
But Pam is so tan.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.153
Forman,

12:46.220 --> 12:48.020
Your whole year off plan..

12:48.087 --> 12:51.898
It's lazy, it's selfish and it's
gonna piss a lot of people off.

12:52.215 --> 12:53.715
So nice job.

12:54.265 --> 12:55.281
Thank you.

12:55.331 --> 12:56.948
What are you gonna do
for cash, man? I mean,

12:56.981 --> 12:58.848
You know, rich kids..
They have a trust fund.

12:58.897 --> 13:01.714
Alls you've got are some poorly
assembled model airplanes.

13:01.764 --> 13:03.822
I melted those.

13:04.406 --> 13:07.389
I guess if I have to work,
It's not a year off, so

13:07.422 --> 13:10.939
Maybe I can sell something. Guys,
What do I have that's worth any money?

13:10.989 --> 13:14.772
Oh, Donna, I can sell
your engagement ring.

13:17.072 --> 13:19.339
She's going to kill him.

13:21.112 --> 13:24.762
Fez, get out of the swing zone.

13:25.495 --> 13:27.678
I got 10 bucks on the girl,

13:28.895 --> 13:30.728
And I mean Donna.

13:32.871 --> 13:35.854
Actually, I have no problem
With you selling it.

13:35.987 --> 13:37.271
Donna,

13:37.521 --> 13:39.654
You are so amazing. I swear, if

13:39.704 --> 13:43.479
I created you in a laboratory,
You could not say more perfect things.

13:43.529 --> 13:47.112
Yeah, but then she'd have those
bolts coming out of her neck.

13:47.412 --> 13:50.212
Well, the only problem is
I don't have the ring.

13:50.279 --> 13:51.062
What?

13:51.096 --> 13:54.996
Well, when I was mad at you for blowing off
the wedding, I threw it off the water tower.

13:55.029 --> 13:59.612
Donna, that ring is a symbol of
our eternal love for each other.

14:00.489 --> 14:04.356
You were gonna sell it to finance
a year of napping and boozing.

14:04.989 --> 14:06.839
Yeah, that's true,

14:06.906 --> 14:09.992
So...who's wrong here?

14:10.122 --> 14:13.022
I think there's a little something
wrong with all of us.

14:19.948 --> 14:22.898
Okay, uh, well, if you threw the ring from up here,

14:22.948 --> 14:25.214
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

14:25.431 --> 14:27.581
All right, excuse me.

14:28.298 --> 14:30.564
I am a police officer in training,

14:30.598 --> 14:32.964
So we're gonna do this by the book.

14:33.048 --> 14:35.981
What book? You didn't read any book.

14:36.581 --> 14:39.331
No, but I was assigned one.

14:39.681 --> 14:42.215
Killed four bees with it.

14:43.848 --> 14:47.532
All right, what we're gonna do
Is we're gonna recreate the scene.

14:47.665 --> 14:51.382
Donna, Eric has just let you down in a big way.

14:51.432 --> 14:55.917
You're up on this tower. You've had a few beers,
So you're starting to feel a little loose

14:55.967 --> 14:59.133
And very, very vulnerable.

14:59.533 --> 15:02.050
- Okay, that sounds about right.
- Okay.

15:02.100 --> 15:04.166
Do you wanna make out?

15:04.800 --> 15:06.516
Kelso, I thought you we were creating the scene.

15:06.550 --> 15:09.433
I'm taking the scene in a new direction.

15:09.483 --> 15:12.764
Okay, okay, let's just get to
the part where she threw the ring.

15:12.864 --> 15:13.981
Okay.

15:14.197 --> 15:15.314
So...

15:15.764 --> 15:20.631
What we're gonna do here is we're gonna throw
an M&M into the woods in place of the ring.

15:20.681 --> 15:23.561
Wherever it lands, we'll search there first.

15:23.778 --> 15:25.711
Fez, give him the M&Ms, man.

15:25.978 --> 15:28.061
Yeah, about that...

15:29.761 --> 15:33.144
Whose dumb idea was it tolet me hold the M&Ms?

15:34.235 --> 15:37.002
All right. Instead of the candy,

15:37.035 --> 15:40.743
we will throw my keys into the woods.

15:45.682 --> 15:49.349
Oh, crap. I just threw my keys into the woods!

15:49.599 --> 15:51.349
Sure did.

15:51.432 --> 15:53.632
Why didn't somebody say something?

15:53.665 --> 15:56.682
So that you'd throw your keys into the woods.

15:57.415 --> 15:59.915
Oh, that's a good burn.

16:00.349 --> 16:02.849
I had very little to do with it.

16:13.856 --> 16:16.806
Okay, Bob, what the hell
are you doing up on your roof?

16:18.706 --> 16:21.506
Hiding from my girlfriends.

16:23.739 --> 16:27.773
This afternoon we were all talking
about our favorite juices.

16:28.373 --> 16:31.060
Pam said her favorite juice was cranberry.

16:31.126 --> 16:33.143
Midge said she liked apple.

16:33.343 --> 16:36.993
To avoid trouble, I said my favorite was cran-apple.

16:38.076 --> 16:41.060
They viewed that as cheating,
and now I'm on the roof.

16:41.110 --> 16:45.743
Kitty and I think that you should
choose between Pam and Midge.

16:45.793 --> 16:49.926
And when I say : "Kitty and I", I mean just Kitty.

16:51.276 --> 16:54.293
And when I say : "Choose between Pam and Midge",

16:54.326 --> 16:57.176
I mean choose Pam.

17:00.493 --> 17:03.659
It's tough. I really love Pam. But

17:03.693 --> 17:07.054
Midge is Donna's mother.
How can I turn my back on that?

17:07.088 --> 17:10.654
Look, just give me a name.
I gotta take something back to Kitty.

17:13.538 --> 17:16.069
So don't go home. Stay here.

17:17.319 --> 17:22.520
I'm not gonna spend the day hiding
on the roof like a damn pigeon.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.467
I got beer.

17:30.667 --> 17:33.383
Well, it is peaceful up here.

17:37.615 --> 17:40.298
All right, did anybody find anything?

17:40.365 --> 17:42.948
I found a pair of my sister's panties.

17:43.882 --> 17:46.982
I knew they were hers
because they had her name and

17:47.282 --> 17:49.315
phone number in them.

17:49.615 --> 17:51.699
A girl's gotta advertise.

17:52.032 --> 17:54.882
You guys, I'm starving, okay?
I haven't eaten all day.

17:54.915 --> 17:56.849
- Here.
- Oh.

17:57.232 --> 17:59.232
Oh, thanks, Fez.

18:00.132 --> 18:02.565
Yeah, good cheetos.

18:03.132 --> 18:06.565
Really? 'Cause I found the min
the woods, and they were damp.

18:08.482 --> 18:10.549
Like something peed on them.

18:11.332 --> 18:15.332
Awesome! Eric ate pee-tos!

18:16.865 --> 18:19.098
Okay, look, I don't wanna start anything,

18:19.148 --> 18:23.648
but had you bought Donna a decent-sized
diamond, we would have found it by now.

18:23.765 --> 18:29.037
The ring was pretty small, man. Whenever
I saw it, I thought Donna was really far away.

18:29.554 --> 18:32.070
She was standing right next to me.

18:32.270 --> 18:35.870
Yeah, when I first saw it, I said,
"Donna, there's dust on your ring."

18:35.920 --> 18:38.320
Then I realized that was the ring.

18:38.703 --> 18:40.837
Guys, guys, stop.

18:40.870 --> 18:44.470
If we don't find it soon,
a mosquito's going to eat it.

18:48.903 --> 18:51.445
Okay, I love the ring.

18:51.495 --> 18:53.962
It was petite, not showy.

18:54.012 --> 18:54.945
Thank you.

18:54.995 --> 18:58.728
Well, you know, Donna has a thing for miniatures.

18:59.362 --> 19:01.329
Okay, you guys, enough about the ring.

19:01.379 --> 19:04.862
Obviously, it was enough
for me to pay for my year off.

19:05.062 --> 19:08.145
And according to "Esquire",
sweater vest are in.

19:08.729 --> 19:10.512
Wow... Jackie, help.

19:10.545 --> 19:13.812
Oh, get away! You touched pee-tos!

19:18.657 --> 19:20.907
He touched pee-tos!

19:25.041 --> 19:26.174
You know what?

19:26.241 --> 19:28.323
Falling off that water tower was a sign.

19:28.348 --> 19:33.124
The minute I stopped working hard,
I accomplished exactly what I needed to do.

19:34.091 --> 19:35.824
I found the ring.

19:36.541 --> 19:41.524
And if you're gonna land on a diamond,
it's best to land on the smallest one ever made.

19:41.908 --> 19:46.299
Well, I'm afraid your school yard
insults have no power here, child.

19:46.382 --> 19:49.099
I'm a whole new me... tougher,

19:49.199 --> 19:51.207
braver and...

19:51.382 --> 19:53.549
louder!

19:54.357 --> 19:56.857
I'm gonna tell my dad what's what

19:56.907 --> 19:59.690
and get my gosh-darn fried chicken.

20:02.257 --> 20:04.757
Okay, Donna, here's the situation.

20:04.824 --> 20:07.824
I have to choose between
Pam and Midge, and it's a

20:07.890 --> 20:12.023
very personal and intimate
decision that only I can make.

20:12.073 --> 20:15.707
It's really scary, so I'd like you to do it.

20:15.990 --> 20:18.816
Dad, I can't choose for you.

20:18.890 --> 20:23.057
Come on, you choose my shirts.
Choose my lady love.

20:23.273 --> 20:25.890
Mom, where are you going?

20:26.040 --> 20:27.006
Bob,

20:27.073 --> 20:30.373
I saw how hard you struggled
to get on the roof earlier.

20:30.440 --> 20:33.257
What with the kicking and the wiggling,

20:33.990 --> 20:38.057
I realized it was time for me to go home
and give you and Midge a chance.

20:38.123 --> 20:41.606
- You're one fine lady.
- I'll miss you, Bob.

20:41.656 --> 20:42.973
And, honey,

20:43.040 --> 20:47.073
It's scary to be on my own, but if you
come with me, I know I can do it.

20:47.156 --> 20:50.556
Oh, mom, I would love to come home with you!

20:50.606 --> 20:51.956
Oh, good.

20:52.006 --> 20:55.489
You're the only one who can explain things to the maid.

21:00.165 --> 21:01.599
Okay,

21:01.665 --> 21:03.982
I'm here to earn my dinner.

21:04.265 --> 21:05.915
What am I doing about Donna?

21:05.965 --> 21:07.449
We're hanging out.

21:07.498 --> 21:09.315
What am I doing about my job?

21:09.365 --> 21:10.632
I quit.

21:11.165 --> 21:13.048
What am I doing about my future?

21:13.165 --> 21:14.448
Nothing.

21:14.988 --> 21:16.638
When am I moving out?

21:17.905 --> 21:19.372
Make me.

21:25.113 --> 21:28.129
Hey, uh, Fez, I think I have
something in my eye.

21:28.191 --> 21:30.958
Is it Donna's engagement ring?

21:32.351 --> 21:35.768
No, no, it's too big for that.

21:36.189 --> 21:41.169
Hey, maybe we should get some doctors' masks
so we don't accidentally inhale Donna's ring.

21:41.231 --> 21:45.429
Okay, okay, Donna, you thought the
engagement ring was big enough, right?

21:45.703 --> 21:47.530
Burn!

21:48.303 --> 21:51.574
- I didn't say anything.
- So say something.

21:51.907 --> 21:54.028
- It could have been bigger.
- Burn!
