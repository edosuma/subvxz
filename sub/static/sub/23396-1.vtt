than what I thought.

05:52.360 --> 05:55.060

06:24.158 --> 06:25.457
- Okay, seriously.
- Why are you like this?

06:25.459 --> 06:27.860
- You're gonna come back from this so fast.
- Mm.

that was so much fun!

11:22.490 --> 11:23.758
Whoo!

11:25.826 --> 11:27.295
Whoo!

11:29.296 --> 11:30.598
Thanks.

11:32.399 --> 11:34.333
You know, we could just start
singing right now.

11:34.335 --> 11:35.633
Lilly could lay down a beat.

11:35.635 --> 11:38.302
BECA: We already look like
the B-team Bellas.

11:38.304 --> 11:40.372
I say we cut our losses.

11:40.374 --> 11:41.739
You guys!

11:41.741 --> 11:42.840
You guys, I am so sorry.

11:42.842 --> 11:44.910
I realize I should not have
used the word "reunion."

11:44.912 --> 11:47.613
I should have said that it was
an excuse to see each other.

11:47.615 --> 11:48.881
I really didn't think that out.

11:48.883 --> 11:50.248
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

11:50.250 --> 11:51.382
You guys were so great.

11:51.384 --> 11:52.850
And this was
a really nice chance

11:52.852 --> 11:53.919
for us to get together.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.153
Right, ladies?

11:55.155 --> 11:57.488
- Yeah, sure.
- Oh, yes.

11:57.490 --> 11:59.257
Oh, yes, really great.

11:59.259 --> 12:00.559
- So great.
- Thank you so much.

12:00.561 --> 12:03.494
I was supposed to go
to my brother's wedding,

12:03.496 --> 12:05.930
- but this is nice, too.
- AUBREY: Aw.

12:05.932 --> 12:07.900
- Yeah.
- CHLOE: Bellas, a toast.

12:07.902 --> 12:10.169
- AMY: There!
- Toast! Yay!

12:10.171 --> 12:11.536
(crying):
To the most amazing

12:11.538 --> 12:14.339
group of women
I have ever known.

12:14.341 --> 12:16.374
- (cheering, whooping)
- I would do anything

12:16.376 --> 12:17.943
to sing with you guys again.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.810
- Anything!
- (gasps)

12:19.812 --> 12:23.315
I mean, really,
I could just crap myself!

12:23.317 --> 12:24.348
- Oh.
- Uh-uh.

12:24.350 --> 12:27.552
ALL:
Cheers.

12:27.554 --> 12:29.555
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'm having a crazy idea.

12:29.557 --> 12:31.623
Okay, I've mentioned
that my dad is in the Army

12:31.625 --> 12:33.525
and, like, basically killed
Osama bin Laden, right?

12:33.527 --> 12:35.560
Some new information
in that sentence, but okay.

12:35.562 --> 12:37.695
Well, what I mean is, he's
kind of a big deal in the Army.

12:37.697 --> 12:40.364
And every year, the USO
puts on this performance

12:40.366 --> 12:41.867
to entertain
and support the troops.

12:41.869 --> 12:44.770
And this year,
DJ Khaled is hosting.

12:44.772 --> 12:46.405
He's got, like,
a gazillion hit songs,

12:46.407 --> 12:48.239
and he's super famous.

12:48.241 --> 12:50.541
- I saw him on a tax commercial.
- (others gasping)

12:50.543 --> 12:52.777
What if I could get us
an invite?

12:52.779 --> 12:54.445
To sing?

12:54.447 --> 12:56.848
No, to run military dark ops.

12:56.850 --> 13:00.451
- Yes, of course, to sing.
- (laughter)

13:00.453 --> 13:02.521
Is there a competition?

13:02.523 --> 13:03.722
There should always be
a competition.

13:03.724 --> 13:06.892
Oh, um...
well, well, no, but...

13:06.894 --> 13:08.993
let's sing together again.

13:08.995 --> 13:11.430
And... and maybe
I'll see my dad.

13:11.432 --> 13:13.565
Or maybe I won't,
you know, because he has

13:13.567 --> 13:15.334
something really important
to do.

13:15.336 --> 13:17.002
Or maybe I'll be
the most important thing

13:17.004 --> 13:19.238
in his life this time.

13:19.240 --> 13:21.341
Maybe.

13:22.976 --> 13:25.377
- Who's with me?
- Me. Mm-hmm.

13:25.379 --> 13:29.013
Yeah. I suddenly have a lot
of free time, so hell yeah.

13:29.015 --> 13:31.349
CYNTHIA ROSE: Well, I just got
kicked out of flight school

13:31.351 --> 13:33.017
for killing 300 fake people.

13:33.019 --> 13:35.954
- I hate fake people.
- I hate a fake bitch.

13:35.956 --> 13:38.824
Can you fly when
you're eight months pregnant?

13:38.826 --> 13:40.626
- What?
- No.

13:40.628 --> 13:41.493
Um...

13:41.495 --> 13:43.494
- Look. - Oh...
- (murmuring, gasping)

13:43.496 --> 13:45.263
That's...
that's eight months pregnant?

13:45.265 --> 13:46.765
You guys didn't notice?

13:46.767 --> 13:48.267
- Well, congratulations.
- Oh, my God.

13:48.269 --> 13:50.701
- Ah!
- (murmuring)

13:50.703 --> 13:52.771
- I mean, I'm so happy for you.
- Amazing! - Wow.

13:52.773 --> 13:54.406
Do you know who the father is?

13:54.408 --> 13:55.507
Eh.

13:55.509 --> 13:56.775
- Oh. - Oh.
- Congratulations.

13:56.777 --> 13:58.709
- Happy accidents.
- (others cheering)

13:58.711 --> 14:01.345
Okay, well, Stacie's out.

14:01.347 --> 14:03.915
So I guess, Emily, you're in.

14:03.917 --> 14:06.050
- Oh, yeah. I'm in for sure.
- Yeah!

14:06.052 --> 14:07.786
AUBREY:
Yay.

14:07.788 --> 14:10.656
- Was I not always in?
- Um...

14:10.658 --> 14:12.023
- Oh, no, no, no. Of course.
- Yes.

14:12.025 --> 14:13.057
Oh, cool. I... Okay.

A few important things
to note before we begin.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.767
- (airplane engine rumbling)
- Grab your luggage.

15:29.769 --> 15:31.837
All right, thank you.

15:31.839 --> 15:33.972
You always want
to stay 25 feet...

15:33.974 --> 15:36.844
(dialogue muffled under
roaring airplane engine)

15:39.011 --> 15:41.012
...choke.
(continues indistinctly)

15:41.014 --> 15:44.416
...very sharp. We do not
want you to impale yourself.

15:44.418 --> 15:45.684
(engine noise dies down)

15:45.686 --> 15:47.953
I hope you all heard
each and every word,

15:47.955 --> 15:51.025
or else you might
very well end up dead.

15:53.460 --> 15:54.626
Ladies, I'm messing with you.

15:54.628 --> 15:56.862
On behalf of the Department
of Defense, we would like

15:56.864 --> 15:59.164
to welcome you to
Naval Air Station Rota, Spain.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.632
And a sincere thank-you
for coming out to entertain

16:01.634 --> 16:02.868
our troops and their families.

16:02.870 --> 16:04.502
We're excited for this tour.

16:04.504 --> 16:06.103
My name's Chicago.
Over here to my left

16:06.105 --> 16:08.540
is Captain Bernie,
who we like to call Zeke.

16:08.542 --> 16:10.975
- Ladies.
- We're gonna be with you the whole tour

16:10.977 --> 16:12.844
- as your escorts and security details.
- AMY: Question.

16:12.846 --> 16:14.881
Will we all be
showering together?

16:16.549 --> 16:17.648
(Chicago clears throat)

16:17.650 --> 16:20.919
Uh, first up is a sound check.

16:20.921 --> 16:24.089
We'll have you back
to the hotel by 1430.

16:24.091 --> 16:25.656
Maybe hit the rain locker,

16:25.658 --> 16:28.526
back here for the big show
at 1700. Yeah.

16:28.528 --> 16:31.932
(clears throat) 1700... is that,
like, later than the night?

16:33.000 --> 16:34.065
It's 5:00.

16:34.067 --> 16:35.599
Okay. Whatever.

16:35.601 --> 16:37.902
- Okay... Yep.
- AMY: Question, question.

16:37.904 --> 16:39.938
Um, so this is the first base.

16:39.940 --> 16:42.810
Will we be going to second base
with you guys?

16:44.610 --> 16:46.777
And then,
maybe a few days later,

16:46.779 --> 16:48.747
we'll go to third base?

16:48.749 --> 16:50.848
- (Amy chuckles)
- That's a "no" for me, so...

16:50.850 --> 16:52.184
Wait, what's after
the third base?

16:52.186 --> 16:54.151
Why don't we get you
to your first venue?

16:54.153 --> 16:55.653
Come on.

16:55.655 --> 16:57.823
CHICAGO:
All right, well, we are

16:57.825 --> 16:59.056
really excited
to have you here.

16:59.058 --> 17:00.691
Right now
we're in Hangar Three.

17:00.693 --> 17:02.727
This is where we keep
all of our helicopters.

17:02.729 --> 17:04.595
Of course, now we've got
the big stage

17:04.597 --> 17:06.096
built up for the tour.

17:06.098 --> 17:08.900
So, on the tour,
we've got three bands.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.801
Over here, we got Saddle Up.

17:10.804 --> 17:13.571
This is Young Sparrow
and DJ Dragon Nutz.

17:13.574 --> 17:15.707
And behind me is Evermoist.

17:15.709 --> 17:17.174

DJ Khaled just rolled in.

17:19.579 --> 17:20.778
GAIL: Let's set the stage,
all right?

17:20.780 --> 17:21.846
- Let's get ready before the...
- So we should turn around

17:21.848 --> 17:23.815
- and shoot into it, I think.
- ...the Bellas out.

17:23.817 --> 17:24.815

18:31.117 --> 18:32.784
I mean, I don't really

Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You with us or against us?

- EMILY: Guys, stop.

18:43.297 --> 18:44.796
They just don't like
sharing the spotlight,

18:44.798 --> 18:45.863
so they're trying
to intimidate us.

18:45.865 --> 18:48.033
Let's just take the high road
and do what we do.

18:48.035 --> 18:49.301
You thinking what I'm thinking?

18:49.303 --> 18:49.934
What are you thinking?

18:49.936 --> 18:50.936
- A riff-off.

18:50.938 --> 18:53.805
- That's not what I was thinking.
- A riff-off!

18:53.807 --> 18:56.141
Wait. Yes.
A riff-off! Yes!

18:56.143 --> 18:57.942
- What is a riff-off?
- Yeah.

18:57.944 --> 18:59.276
A riff-off is a little game

18:59.278 --> 19:01.813
that we like to play
to see who's better.

19:01.815 --> 19:03.782
- Mm-hmm.

19:03.784 --> 19:05.683
- Let's say "party songs."

So...

25:36.476 --> 25:38.409
Emily, is it true
what you said back there?

25:38.411 --> 25:40.311
Are you really
not writing anymore?

25:40.313 --> 25:42.313
Well, not...
I mean, not right now.

25:42.315 --> 25:44.015
Anyway, I've got 21 credits

25:44.017 --> 25:46.383
that I'm taking this semester.
The GRE is coming up.

25:46.385 --> 25:48.553
It's right around the corner.
Uh, and...

25:48.555 --> 25:50.587
I got a hamster now.

25:50.589 --> 25:52.356
Aw. That's amazing.

25:52.358 --> 25:54.758
Well, don't give up.
My dad always says,

25:54.760 --> 25:56.227
"Age wrinkles the body,

25:56.229 --> 25:58.763
but quitting
wrinkles the soul."

25:58.765 --> 26:00.334
Hmm.

26:01.634 --> 26:05.268
- Three...
- How about those Bulls?

26:05.270 --> 26:07.638

26:17.250 --> 26:18.682
Yeah, I'm actually
from Georgia.

26:18.684 --> 26:19.750
Oh.

26:19.752 --> 26:21.151
So, what's your story?

26:21.153 --> 26:22.286
Why are you here?

26:22.288 --> 26:24.087
Oh, boy. Um...

26:24.089 --> 26:26.157
Long story short,
I was in the NG,

26:26.159 --> 26:29.293
but my CO recommended me
for OCS after, uh, AIT.

26:29.295 --> 26:32.130
(voice fading): Then came OBC
and RTB where I, uh,

26:32.132 --> 26:34.097
was the, uh, DG of my class.

26:34.099 --> 26:36.500
It's... I don't know.

26:36.502 --> 26:38.268
Sorry. Um...

26:38.270 --> 26:40.037
I joined the National Guard.

26:40.039 --> 26:41.538
They helped put me
through college.

26:41.540 --> 26:44.409
(voice fades): I spent about
a year stationed in Kabul.

26:44.411 --> 26:47.511
Uh, actually overseeing
a canine unit over there.

26:47.513 --> 26:49.080
We trained German shepherds,

26:49.082 --> 26:50.782
- we trained pit bulls...
- (distant, echoing barking)

26:50.784 --> 26:52.650
Dogs.

26:52.652 --> 26:53.750
I love dogs. (chuckles)

26:53.752 --> 26:55.452
I love animals, in general.

26:55.454 --> 26:58.055
- Animals are cute.
- You're cute. I mean, what?

26:58.057 --> 27:00.123
- What about you?
- Me? (sighs) Me.

27:00.125 --> 27:01.292
Uh, shorter story...

27:01.294 --> 27:03.661
I was in a singing group
in college,

27:03.663 --> 27:08.399
and then now I am still
in that same singing group,

27:08.401 --> 27:10.434
but not in college.

27:10.436 --> 27:11.701
- But you're committed.
- I am committed.

27:11.703 --> 27:13.171
- That's great.
- Yeah, I love commitment

27:13.173 --> 27:14.505
- and being committed.
- Yeah.

27:14.507 --> 27:16.440
- Not to, like, an asylum. (chuckles) Whoa.
- Right.

27:16.442 --> 27:17.842
Or, like, a hospital, like,
it's... I'm not saying...

27:17.844 --> 27:19.576
- Yeah, no, I know.
- But, like... just, I like...

27:19.578 --> 27:21.578
I love love.
I love being committed to love.

27:21.580 --> 27:24.414
Not to you, but to, like...
I love, um, like, oranges.

27:24.416 --> 27:25.650
- Oranges.
- I love...

27:25.652 --> 27:27.785
Hey. Uh, girls?

27:27.787 --> 27:29.453
- Hmm?
- We have separate rooms. We don't have to

27:29.455 --> 27:30.587
sleep on top
of each other anymore.

27:30.589 --> 27:32.722
- What?
- AUBREY: Hey, that's great.

27:32.724 --> 27:34.292
Um, not sexually.

27:34.294 --> 27:35.763
There was that one time.

27:43.169 --> 27:45.202
(quiet chatter)

27:45.204 --> 27:47.404
(all yelling)

27:47.406 --> 27:49.474
BECA:
Stop being so loud.

27:49.476 --> 27:51.275
- Yeah. No, yeah.
- Oh, that's what I want.

27:51.277 --> 27:52.509
Uh, no,
that's the molasses one.

27:52.511 --> 27:54.211
No, you're not gonna
like that one.

27:54.213 --> 27:55.479
- This one.
- I don't want molasses.

27:55.481 --> 27:57.414
BECA: Okay, you guys,
so we've never

27:57.416 --> 27:59.382
competed against bands
that play actual instruments.

27:59.384 --> 28:00.517
What's the plan?

28:00.519 --> 28:03.421
I really think we should just
stay true to ourselves,

28:03.423 --> 28:05.623
- and it will all figure itself out.
- AMY: Emily?

28:05.625 --> 28:08.226
- Mm-hmm.
- Please hear this in the best way possible.

28:08.228 --> 28:09.893
You're a very stupid person.

28:09.895 --> 28:11.895
CHLOE: You know what?
Maybe it won't matter

28:11.897 --> 28:14.465
if we win or not, because
they will like us so much

28:14.467 --> 28:16.433
that they will invite us
to keep touring with them.

28:16.435 --> 28:18.302
And it won't matter
if I get into vet school

28:18.304 --> 28:19.903
because we will be together
as a family,

28:19.905 --> 28:21.506
supporting each other.

28:21.508 --> 28:23.343
And really, isn't that
what it's all about?

28:24.374 --> 28:25.343
- Yes.
- AUBREY: Yes.

28:25.345 --> 28:26.878
Yeah, except for all families
break apart,

28:26.880 --> 28:30.851
and the only person you can
ever truly rely on is yourself.

28:33.519 --> 28:35.385
All right,
time to drop a smash.

28:35.387 --> 28:38.523
- What? - Oh, no, no, no.
- Whoo! - Wait.

28:38.525 --> 28:40.461

- Yeah. The riff-off thing.

to those.

30:43.415 --> 30:44.515
...music exec
at Khaled's label.

30:44.517 --> 30:45.749
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:45.751 --> 30:47.517
- What?
- No, I-I... I work

30:47.519 --> 30:48.919

and you...

30:48.921 --> 30:50.888
they... they don't look
like you.

30:50.890 --> 30:52.055
Oh.

30:52.057 --> 30:54.725
What... what do I look like?

30:54.727 --> 30:55.625
A turtle.

30:55.627 --> 30:59.063
Well, that's in...
incredibly specific.

30:59.065 --> 31:00.998
But, like, you literally
look just like that.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.432
No, no. It's accurate.

you'll open for Khaled?

31:19.719 --> 31:21.951
Uh, no, I-I...
I didn't say that.

31:21.953 --> 31:24.421
Yeah, you did. You did.
You just said it before.

31:24.423 --> 31:25.690
You kind of implied it,
if anything.

31:25.692 --> 31:27.024
- Well, I just...
- I could just

for fun, if you like.

36:54.152 --> 36:56.887
GAIL:
Tough blow. What was that?

36:56.889 --> 36:58.655
JOHN:
That, my friend, was "Taps"

36:58.657 --> 36:59.956
from the back of the house.

36:59.958 --> 37:01.157
Salute, salute.
We have to salute.

37:01.159 --> 37:02.959
Stand at attention.
This is "Taps."

37:02.961 --> 37:05.028
JOHN:
It's to honor fallen soldiers,

37:05.030 --> 37:07.130
and tonight,
it's the fallen Bellas.

37:07.132 --> 37:10.034
GAIL: Look at this. Those girls
don't even know what to do.

37:10.036 --> 37:11.769
(chuckling):
They look like idiots.

37:11.771 --> 37:13.170
This is the best thing
for the movie.

37:13.172 --> 37:15.275
(laughing):
It couldn't be better.

37:17.976 --> 37:19.909
Should we be considering
using instruments?

37:19.911 --> 37:21.445
- Is that crazy?
- (Aubrey laughing)

37:21.447 --> 37:23.280
Oh, that's so funny.

37:23.282 --> 37:25.416
You know, I'm gonna pretend
that you didn't just say that

37:25.418 --> 37:26.516
so we can still be friends.

then we wouldn't need me.

37:31.023 --> 37:31.889

37:31.891 --> 37:33.456
why Jessica and Ashley
are even here.

37:33.458 --> 37:35.191

37:35.193 --> 37:36.793
Don't be stupid.

37:36.795 --> 37:38.461
AUBREY:
You know what? I have an idea.

37:38.463 --> 37:41.298
We just need to show DJ Khaled
that we are different

37:41.300 --> 37:44.467
and better than all
of those other bands, you know?

37:44.469 --> 37:45.869
I think we did great.

37:45.871 --> 37:48.137
I just think the horn
cut our vibe.

37:48.139 --> 37:50.273
- True that. (clicks tongue)
- (door opens)

37:50.275 --> 37:51.809
All right, ladies.
Pick up your tits.

37:51.811 --> 37:53.043
We're going out.

37:54.213 --> 37:55.311
EMILY: What do you mean,
what do I mean?

37:55.313 --> 37:57.947
- We just sucked balls in front of DJ Khaled.
- Hmm?

37:57.949 --> 38:00.284
- Listening.

38:01.820 --> 38:03.353

we get dressed,

38:03.355 --> 38:06.423
we go over there, and we show
him that we are not a joke.

38:06.425 --> 38:10.226

38:10.228 --> 38:13.796

came out of your dumb mouth.

38:13.798 --> 38:15.199
- Thank you.
- Okay?

38:15.201 --> 38:17.233
- So let's get tarted up and...
- CHLOE: Tatted up?

38:17.235 --> 38:20.204
- Tarted. Yeah, yeah, tarted up.
- It sounds like "tatted up."

38:20.206 --> 38:22.039
- She means "tatted."
- She's the caramel tart.

38:22.041 --> 38:24.441
She's a chocolate tart.
You're the vanilla tart.

38:24.443 --> 38:26.242
Thanks, babe.

38:26.244 --> 38:28.244
Mm...

- Oh, "tarted." "Tarted."

38:31.117 --> 38:32.883
If it's easier,
we'll just say "slutty."

38:32.885 --> 38:33.950

40:18.958 --> 40:20.090
You shouldn't have run away.

You should've talked to me.

About what, the C-4 explosives
I found in the cereal box?

40:26.197 --> 40:28.498
Or what about the time
you smuggled drugs

40:28.500 --> 40:30.434
in Sir Bounce-a-lot
and I had to see him

40:30.436 --> 40:34.503

40:34.505 --> 40:37.507
Sweetheart,
it was my profession.

40:37.509 --> 40:39.376
What, being dodgy?

40:39.378 --> 40:41.411
Well, that's one word for it.

40:41.413 --> 40:44.648
I mean, yeah, I was a criminal,
but I'm different now.

40:50.054 --> 40:51.988
I've known where
you've been for years.

40:51.990 --> 40:55.391
Uh, it's impossible for you
not to stand out in a crowd.

40:55.393 --> 40:57.159

Lenny's suite.

42:37.628 --> 42:39.162
That's embarrassing.

42:39.164 --> 42:40.496
Oh, no, it's, uh,
DJ Khaled's suite.

42:40.498 --> 42:41.999
- Is it? - (others gasping)
- Yeah.

42:42.001 --> 42:43.499
Oh, I had no idea.

We're throwing a...

I'll give you a tour.

- Great. - Yeah.
- All right, come this way.

42:52.610 --> 42:55.644
Uh, Khaled, right now he's, uh,
into this kind of feng shui,

42:55.646 --> 42:57.748
so he has a specific kind
of arrangement

42:57.750 --> 42:59.715
to maximize his chi.

42:59.717 --> 43:03.119
And, oh, Sunburst here
is Khaled's juiceologist.

43:03.121 --> 43:05.287
Ah, Theo, pardon my zesting.

43:05.289 --> 43:06.456

43:06.458 --> 43:07.758
Your glands look frustrated.

43:07.760 --> 43:09.126

43:09.128 --> 43:10.526
beet juice was reserved

43:10.528 --> 43:12.699
DJ Khaled is the king
of the beats.

Beat King, 'cause he's the...

43:17.536 --> 43:19.536

we didn't like that at all.

43:19.538 --> 43:20.670

It's awful. I know.

43:20.672 --> 43:24.273
Um, can you explain this,
uh, terrifying situation?

43:24.275 --> 43:26.409
- What? What, my... the face?
- Not your face.

43:26.411 --> 43:28.612
- Um, the thing behind you.
- Oh, the apiary.

43:28.614 --> 43:31.815
- Hmm.
- Oh, right, yeah, no, this is, uh, a portable beehive

43:31.817 --> 43:34.550
that Sunburst uses
to harvest natural honey.

I can't wait.

46:00.364 --> 46:01.965
We'll travel the world
in my yacht,

46:01.967 --> 46:05.601
stop at all your favorite
places... the Atlantic Ocean,

46:05.603 --> 46:07.369
- the Pacific Ocean...

46:07.371 --> 46:09.773
But I'm in the middle
of a tour right now.

46:09.775 --> 46:11.807
But that's perfect.
I'll finally be able

46:11.809 --> 46:13.776
to see one
of your performances.

46:13.778 --> 46:16.246
Dad, you've never come
to any of my performances.

46:16.248 --> 46:19.583
Sweetheart, I've changed.

46:19.585 --> 46:22.552
It's not the first time
I've heard that.

46:22.554 --> 46:26.555
But you're still my little
Turnip Top, aren't you?

46:26.557 --> 46:30.726
I promise I won't
screw it up this time.

46:30.728 --> 46:32.996
MAN: General Posen and I
were wrapping up

46:32.998 --> 46:34.764
a, uh, clandestine operation.

46:34.766 --> 46:37.867
In fact, I've just come
from our classified briefing.

46:37.869 --> 46:40.670
Oh, my God, so you were just
with Aubrey's dad?

46:40.672 --> 46:42.472
He was so excited
to see your show.

46:42.474 --> 46:45.411
It's just too bad
that he can't make it.

46:46.378 --> 46:48.278
- EMILY: Oh.
- Oh.

46:48.280 --> 46:49.813
Oh, that's okay.

46:49.815 --> 46:51.748
- Yeah, it's-it's really okay.
- No, that's okay.

46:51.750 --> 46:53.682
- It's totally fine. You know, he's a busy man.
- Uh-huh.

46:53.684 --> 46:55.684
- That's right.
- And my dad always said,

46:55.686 --> 46:58.822
"Expect finite disappointment,
and remember,

46:58.824 --> 47:00.624
there's always more
where that came from."

47:00.626 --> 47:02.492
- (screams)
- Oh, my God, Aubrey!

47:02.494 --> 47:05.498
(frantic chatter and screaming)

47:20.911 --> 47:23.912

Oh, hey.

47:49.775 --> 47:52.409
Heard you all really, uh,
lit it up last night.

47:52.411 --> 47:53.543
(laughs)

47:53.545 --> 47:54.943
That's a great joke.

47:54.945 --> 47:56.679

47:56.681 --> 48:00.383

48:21.005 --> 48:24.106
Sorry, I forgot where we were
in the conversation.

48:24.108 --> 48:27.711
Next time, when you're trying
to impress DJ Khaled,

48:27.713 --> 48:29.845
try to have some dignity.

48:29.847 --> 48:33.849
Uh, we never do anything
with dignity, so...

48:33.851 --> 48:35.453
Hey, where'd you go last night?

48:36.387 --> 48:37.720
What, uh, you mean

48:37.722 --> 48:39.722
when you were burning down
the hotel?

48:39.724 --> 48:40.990
Dude, where were you?

48:40.992 --> 48:43.959
Okay. I was with my father,
all right?

48:43.961 --> 48:45.595
Wait, your dad?

48:45.597 --> 48:47.396
He's been trying
to track me down for years,

48:47.398 --> 48:48.597
and last night, he found me.

48:48.599 --> 48:50.766
Why are you running from him?

48:50.768 --> 48:52.702
I wish my dad
would pay attention to me.

48:52.704 --> 48:55.838
Because my dad
wasn't a very nice man.

48:55.840 --> 48:58.708
So, when I was 18,
I had to run away,

48:58.710 --> 49:01.610
which was a real bitch
because of the chafing.

49:01.612 --> 49:04.613
And now he has found me,

49:04.615 --> 49:07.751
and I don't know what to think.

49:07.753 --> 49:11.554
I mean, I-I think that's
amazing, and so should you.

49:11.556 --> 49:13.956
I mean, it-it's...
it's a crazy thing.

49:13.958 --> 49:16.059
He's finally found you
after all these years?

49:16.061 --> 49:18.427
Now you can rekindle
the relationship,

49:18.429 --> 49:20.162
and-and it could be
even stronger than it was.

49:20.164 --> 49:22.132
And maybe he was not
a very nice guy before,

49:22.134 --> 49:24.032
but maybe he is now,
and maybe he's amazing

49:24.034 --> 49:26.168
- and wonderful and he wants...
- Okay, Emily, you are so shrill

49:26.170 --> 49:27.670
- and inarticulate!
- No, no!

49:27.672 --> 49:29.139
- (frantic chatter)
- (cell phone ringing)

49:29.141 --> 49:30.740
Hello? Oh, it's Stacie.

49:30.742 --> 49:32.976
Stacie! Stacie's calling me
on FaceTime.

49:32.978 --> 49:34.711
- You guys! Stop. Get over here.
- What, Stacie?

49:34.713 --> 49:36.412
- Oh, hello?
- Wait. Right over here.

49:36.414 --> 49:37.713

49:39.818 --> 49:41.950

49:41.952 --> 49:43.653
Yeah, we getting our asses
handed to us.

49:43.655 --> 49:46.923

49:46.925 --> 49:48.191

49:48.193 --> 49:49.525

- Aw.

49:49.527 --> 49:50.592
He's so cute.

49:50.594 --> 49:52.494
She's a girl.

49:52.496 --> 49:53.829
Oh, okay, then average.

49:53.831 --> 49:54.930
CHLOE:
What's her name?

49:54.932 --> 49:56.699
Baby Fat Amy
or Baby Fat Patricia.

49:56.701 --> 49:58.635
- You can choose.
- No, no, listen.

49:58.637 --> 49:59.936
I know I've always been
your favorite.

49:59.938 --> 50:01.941
- (overlapping chatter)
- Guys.

50:03.108 --> 50:04.706
I named her Bella.

50:04.708 --> 50:06.041
- (gasps)
- Aw.

50:06.043 --> 50:07.677
- See? - That is adorable.
- Oh, that's perfect.

50:07.679 --> 50:09.179
- That... Okay.
- STACIE: I love you guys.

50:09.181 --> 50:11.680
- We love you. We love you so much.
- We miss you.

50:11.682 --> 50:12.916

50:12.918 --> 50:15.517

50:15.519 --> 50:17.519
Guys, can we stop trying
to win this tour

50:17.521 --> 50:18.954
and just sing together?

50:18.956 --> 50:21.157
I mean, that's why
we're all here, right?

50:21.159 --> 50:22.858
Yeah. (chuckles)

50:22.860 --> 50:25.094

and win this thing

What a fitting swan song
for the Barden Bellas.

53:06.224 --> 53:08.124
Yes, and as these young women
approach 30

53:08.126 --> 53:10.126
and cease to be of value
as human beings,

53:10.128 --> 53:12.260
perhaps this
is the bittersweet memory

53:12.262 --> 53:15.264
they will take
into the bar with them.

welcome to the South of France.

53:31.750 --> 53:34.150
We wanted to do something
kind of special for you guys.

53:34.152 --> 53:35.885
- (Bellas oohing and aahing)
- Wow.

53:35.887 --> 53:37.753
This feels like a group date
on <i>The Bachelor.</i>

53:37.755 --> 53:39.755
Oh, it's just so beautiful.

53:39.757 --> 53:41.824
Yeah, thank you.

53:41.826 --> 53:43.291
Not free.

53:43.293 --> 53:44.793
Got it.

53:44.795 --> 53:46.295
Hey. (chuckles)

53:46.297 --> 53:51.300
Um, hey, I just wanted to say
thank you for... for this.

53:51.302 --> 53:54.302
- Oh.
- And for looking out for us on this trip.

53:54.304 --> 53:58.675
And protecting
the United States... always.

53:58.677 --> 54:00.309
It's my pleasure.

54:00.311 --> 54:01.778
Must be kind of lonely,

54:01.780 --> 54:03.278
always being away
from your family,

54:03.280 --> 54:05.313
- being in a different place.
- Yeah.

54:05.315 --> 54:07.249
But being in the Army
is kind of like

54:07.251 --> 54:09.052
having a second family,
you know.

54:09.054 --> 54:11.287
Well, yeah, of course you know.

54:11.289 --> 54:13.923
I mean, you guys come together
for your tour,

54:13.925 --> 54:15.458

you go your separate ways.

54:15.460 --> 54:19.195
But you're always gonna
be there for each other, right?

54:19.197 --> 54:23.166
I mean, you're never
really alone.

54:23.168 --> 54:26.202
Wow, that was really cheesy.

54:26.204 --> 54:27.436
No. (chuckles)

54:27.438 --> 54:28.906
I liked it.

54:34.945 --> 54:36.079
You okay?

54:36.081 --> 54:37.479
Oh, yeah. (chuckles)

from me.

54:48.092 --> 54:51.193
Mm-hmm.

54:51.195 --> 54:53.963
Well, to be totally honest,
my dad was supposed to come

54:53.965 --> 54:55.363

54:55.365 --> 54:57.166

that he can't make it.

And he's never actually
heard me sing with the Bellas,

54:59.838 --> 55:02.204

he never will, so...

57:17.541 --> 57:20.208
when you was just
playing around with the loop

57:20.210 --> 57:21.943
and you was singing
and you was just...

57:21.945 --> 57:25.347

just playing around, but...

57:25.349 --> 57:29.217
I seen something,
I heard something,

57:29.219 --> 57:32.021
then I felt something.

57:32.023 --> 57:33.655
Amidst the chaos,
I went back in the room,

57:33.657 --> 57:35.057
and I pulled your recording.

57:35.059 --> 57:38.226
Why did you do that?

57:38.228 --> 57:40.329
Because I wanted to know
what you could do on your own.

57:40.331 --> 57:43.365
Beca, it's time to go
to the next level.

57:43.367 --> 57:45.034

something special.

58:02.686 --> 58:04.420
It's time for you to grow.

mountaintop and reach the top.

will be happy for you.

It is. It is.

01:01:55.385 --> 01:01:56.851
The show's literally tomorrow.

01:01:56.853 --> 01:01:59.420
- I know.
- CHLOE: Guys, if Khaled picks us,

01:01:59.422 --> 01:02:01.492
it'll be
our last show together.

01:02:02.659 --> 01:02:04.827
Bellas, a toast.

01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:07.262
- EMILY: Ah, a Chloe toast.
- CHLOE: They say that...

01:02:07.264 --> 01:02:09.465
home is where the heart is.

01:02:09.467 --> 01:02:14.802
But you guys are the homes
that my heart lives in.

01:02:14.804 --> 01:02:17.541
I am inside of all of you.

01:02:19.342 --> 01:02:20.778
It feels so good.

01:02:21.811 --> 01:02:24.280
- Cheers. - Cheers.
- Salud. - Cheers!

01:02:24.282 --> 01:02:26.481
- Cheers!
- Guys, I love you so much.

01:02:26.483 --> 01:02:28.483
- (sighs) I feel like...
- Are you hallucinating?

01:02:28.485 --> 01:02:31.387
Excuse me.
Uh, are you the Bellas?

01:02:31.389 --> 01:02:33.289
- Yes.
- <i>Oui, monsieur.</i>

01:02:33.291 --> 01:02:34.722
- <i>Sí.</i>
- My name is Henri.

01:02:34.724 --> 01:02:37.525
Chicago sent me to take you
to the USO reception.

01:02:37.527 --> 01:02:39.260
- Uh...
- Reception? - Huh?

01:02:39.262 --> 01:02:41.530
Chicago never mentioned
any reception.

01:02:41.532 --> 01:02:44.233
Something about
an announcement?

01:02:44.235 --> 01:02:46.735
- Oh. We won. - What?
- Did we win?

01:02:46.737 --> 01:02:48.537
CHLOE: Um, we need
to find our friends,

01:02:48.539 --> 01:02:50.405
- Beca and Fat Amy.
- Great.

01:02:50.407 --> 01:02:53.441
Oh, they are already there
with Chicago.

01:02:53.443 --> 01:02:55.476
- Oh.
- Perfect.

01:02:55.478 --> 01:02:58.347
Let's not keep this
handsome Frenchman waiting.

01:02:58.349 --> 01:02:59.581
- Let's go. Shotgun!
- Ready?

01:02:59.583 --> 01:03:00.782
I guess we should go.
Let's go.

01:03:00.784 --> 01:03:03.351
- Yeah. - Come on.
- Hey, let's go. - Henri?

01:03:03.353 --> 01:03:05.653
- Oh, yeah. Whoo!
- Sounds like music.

01:03:05.655 --> 01:03:08.824
I am Florencia.
Nice to meet you.

Oh, <i>la vache.</i>
The singing sounded very good.

01:03:47.498 --> 01:03:50.599
- Oh, <i>merci beaucoup, Henri.</i>
- Um, are we almost there?

01:03:50.601 --> 01:03:52.767
Uh, yes. In fact...

01:03:52.769 --> 01:03:54.869
EMILY: 'Cause it feels like
we've been driving forever.

01:03:54.871 --> 01:03:56.472
...we are right here.

01:03:56.474 --> 01:03:58.273
CHLOE:
Yay! Oh, great!

01:03:58.275 --> 01:03:59.775
I don't know.
I can't lift it.

01:03:59.777 --> 01:04:01.577
I can't see.
I can't see anything.

01:04:01.579 --> 01:04:03.012
Why won't the shade go up?
It's, like, stuck.

01:04:03.014 --> 01:04:04.979
- It's so dark out there.
- Can you guys see out yours?

01:04:04.981 --> 01:04:08.650
- No. - No, I can't see.
- Well, this don't seem right.

01:04:08.652 --> 01:04:10.286
- Maybe we...
- (banging)

01:04:10.288 --> 01:04:11.420
- (gasping)
- Whoa! - Oh!

01:04:11.422 --> 01:04:13.354
- (rattling)
- What was that?

01:04:13.356 --> 01:04:15.860
- I don't know. What was that?
- (metallic creaking)

01:04:17.661 --> 01:04:19.295
What?

01:04:19.297 --> 01:04:22.563
- What happened?
- Huh?

01:04:22.565 --> 01:04:24.365
I don't know.

01:04:24.367 --> 01:04:26.568
Hang on.
You guys, are we...

01:04:26.570 --> 01:04:29.338
- Are we floating?
- (creaking continues)

01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:31.072
- Why would we be floating?
- What?

01:04:31.074 --> 01:04:33.010
(horn droning)

01:04:34.878 --> 01:04:36.545
- (rattling)
- CHLOE: <i>Guys?</i>

01:04:36.547 --> 01:04:37.845
You guys,
I can't open the door.

01:04:37.847 --> 01:04:39.581
AUBREY:
What? The door's not opening?

01:04:39.583 --> 01:04:42.016
It's the old van-ferry
death-trap maneuver.

01:04:42.018 --> 01:04:44.353
I should've seen it coming.

01:04:44.355 --> 01:04:45.586
- Oh, God.
- What?

01:04:45.588 --> 01:04:47.956
- Open it. Open the door.
- Help!

01:04:47.958 --> 01:04:49.090
Does... does anybody's
cell phone work?

01:04:49.092 --> 01:04:50.092
Where's my cell phone?

01:04:50.094 --> 01:04:51.392
No service.

01:04:51.394 --> 01:04:52.827
No service. There's nothing.

01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:55.530
- That's so inconvenient.
- (crying): Hell's bells!

01:04:55.532 --> 01:04:56.865
EMILY: We could scream
on the count of three.

01:04:56.867 --> 01:04:58.900
- Okay. One, two, three.
- One, two, three!

01:04:58.902 --> 01:05:00.437
ALL:
Help!

01:05:08.545 --> 01:05:10.914
Sir Bounce-a-lot.

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:26.764
(cell phone ringing)

01:05:28.699 --> 01:05:31.467
- I told you we're through!
- FERGUS: I know.

01:05:31.469 --> 01:05:33.802
But there are some people here

01:05:33.804 --> 01:05:36.637
who think you should
reconsider.

01:05:36.639 --> 01:05:40.041
- ALL: Amy!
- (overlapping chatter)

01:05:40.043 --> 01:05:41.011
(chatter stops)

01:05:42.679 --> 01:05:43.979
How could you?

01:05:43.981 --> 01:05:46.882
I swear to God,
if you hurt any one of them,

01:05:46.884 --> 01:05:49.985
except for Jessica and Ashley,
I will kill you!

01:05:49.987 --> 01:05:51.954
I don't want to hurt anyone,
Patricia.

01:05:51.956 --> 01:05:54.923
The only one I wanted was you,
but you weren't with them,

01:05:54.925 --> 01:05:56.492
were you?

01:05:56.494 --> 01:05:58.159
Oh, well.

01:05:58.161 --> 01:06:00.128
Plan B.

01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:02.398
You have 30 minutes.

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.865
Come to the boat,

01:06:03.867 --> 01:06:06.568
or your friends
swim with the fishies.

01:06:06.570 --> 01:06:09.037
And I think you know I mean it.

01:06:09.039 --> 01:06:10.873
Oh, I know you mean it.

01:06:10.875 --> 01:06:12.740
Because you're
a terrible person

01:06:12.742 --> 01:06:15.010
that does terrible things.

01:06:15.012 --> 01:06:17.612
But there's one thing
you're forgetting, Dad.

01:06:17.614 --> 01:06:18.981
I'm your daughter.

01:06:18.983 --> 01:06:22.483
Your nightmare blood,
it runs through my veins!

01:06:22.485 --> 01:06:24.186
Hey, Amy, um, I need to talk
to you about something.

01:06:24.188 --> 01:06:26.789
- It's kind of important.
- Oh, yeah, just a sec.

01:06:26.791 --> 01:06:28.423
- I'm on a call.
- Okay.

01:06:28.425 --> 01:06:29.657
You think you're bad?

01:06:29.659 --> 01:06:32.994
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

01:06:32.996 --> 01:06:35.063
I've graduated college.

01:06:35.065 --> 01:06:36.764
I could do anything.

01:06:36.766 --> 01:06:39.101
So say your prayers,

01:06:39.103 --> 01:06:42.104
'cause Fat Amy is coming...

01:06:42.106 --> 01:06:44.972
for you.

01:06:44.974 --> 01:06:46.708
Now!

01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:49.677
(phone beeps)

01:06:49.679 --> 01:06:52.113
So... (sighs)

01:06:52.115 --> 01:06:54.650
which two of you

01:06:54.652 --> 01:06:56.887
are Ashley and Jessica?

01:06:58.489 --> 01:07:00.822
- Ah, shit.
- BECA: <i>Okay, so...</i>

01:07:00.824 --> 01:07:01.891
I have kind of bad news.

01:07:01.893 --> 01:07:04.159
Uh, and I know you're
gonna be fine. Uh, I know

01:07:04.161 --> 01:07:06.030
- every-everybody's gonna be fine, but, like...
- Uh-huh.

01:07:07.898 --> 01:07:09.231
Oh.

01:07:09.233 --> 01:07:12.099
- Um, w-well...
- Yep.

01:07:12.101 --> 01:07:14.101
We didn't get picked, man.
And you know what?

01:07:14.103 --> 01:07:16.838
Like, screw them. It's not,
like, the whole story.

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:19.842
There's... uh, uh, uh...

01:07:19.844 --> 01:07:21.844
I don't know, I still feel
like I want to tell you

01:07:21.846 --> 01:07:22.711
'cause I think that, like,

01:07:22.713 --> 01:07:24.679
secrets are, like,
the worst, right?

01:07:24.681 --> 01:07:25.847
So...

01:07:25.849 --> 01:07:27.715
Yeah, it's the worst.

01:07:27.717 --> 01:07:29.117
Let's go.

01:07:29.119 --> 01:07:30.586
Go where?

01:07:30.588 --> 01:07:32.990
Don't worry.
We'll change in the cab.

01:07:38.262 --> 01:07:39.795
BECA:
Amy, what are we doing?

01:07:39.797 --> 01:07:42.130
Why are we not calling
the police or Chicago?

01:07:42.132 --> 01:07:44.099
AMY:
No cops. There's no time.

01:07:44.101 --> 01:07:46.635
And if my dad sees 'em,
he'll take off.

01:07:46.637 --> 01:07:47.836
BECA:
This is serious.

01:07:47.838 --> 01:07:49.604
The Bellas
could really get hurt.

01:07:49.606 --> 01:07:51.572
- Not on my watch.
- Amy, come on.

01:07:51.574 --> 01:07:53.141
Look, I know my father.

01:07:53.143 --> 01:07:54.742
I know his guys.

01:07:54.744 --> 01:07:56.878
Some of them I know,
like, really well.

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:59.248
And I know that boat.

01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:01.148
We can do this.

01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:03.117
Okay. What's the plan?

01:08:03.119 --> 01:08:05.987
First up, I need you
to pick up the pace.

01:08:05.989 --> 01:08:07.891
This boat's not gonna
row itself.

01:08:13.030 --> 01:08:15.030
Okay. That's the ladder
that'll take you

01:08:15.032 --> 01:08:16.865
up to the main deck
where the Bellas are.

01:08:16.867 --> 01:08:18.799
Do not let Fergus
hear what I'm doing below.

01:08:18.801 --> 01:08:20.801
Okay, giant distraction
coming up.

01:08:20.804 --> 01:08:23.237
- You sure about this?
- Have I ever let you down?

01:08:23.238 --> 01:08:26.107
Dozens of examples
spring to mind, if I'm honest.

01:08:26.109 --> 01:08:28.143
- What?
- Yeah, you're very unreliable.

01:08:28.145 --> 01:08:30.144
It's, like, one of the
hallmarks of your personality.

01:08:30.145 --> 01:08:32.747
I don't think we have time
to unpack that right now.

01:08:32.750 --> 01:08:35.049
Shh. I'll just see you up top.

01:08:35.051 --> 01:08:36.684
Nobody's gonna die tonight,
right?

01:08:36.685 --> 01:08:37.986
- Yeah.
- Right?

01:08:37.988 --> 01:08:39.921
- Yeah.
- Well, that doesn't help.

01:08:39.923 --> 01:08:41.557
- Okay.
- Okay, ready?

01:08:41.559 --> 01:08:42.991
I've got my serious face
on now.

01:08:42.993 --> 01:08:44.792
- Okay.
- It's time.

01:08:44.795 --> 01:08:46.928
- Let's do it.
- (inhales sharply)

01:08:46.930 --> 01:08:50.566
Once we get the money,
we sail directly to Sydney.

01:08:50.568 --> 01:08:52.800
Unless she doesn't show.

01:08:52.801 --> 01:08:55.603
Then things get ugly.

01:08:55.604 --> 01:08:57.205
Ten minutes, ladies.

01:08:57.207 --> 01:08:59.676
Guys, you know
what we should do?

01:09:00.877 --> 01:09:02.210
Where did you come from?

01:09:02.212 --> 01:09:03.344
What?

01:09:03.345 --> 01:09:04.679
You weren't here before.

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:06.682
I've been here the whole time.

01:09:06.684 --> 01:09:09.118
I'm just small.

01:09:14.725 --> 01:09:18.794
Just... if we only have
ten minutes left,

01:09:18.796 --> 01:09:21.964
I say we spend it
doing something we love.

01:09:21.966 --> 01:09:26.237
Let's go out like Bellas and...
and sing one more song.

01:09:28.238 --> 01:09:31.038
- You want to sing right now?
- (overlapping chatter)

01:09:31.041 --> 01:09:33.241
I think we should sing
one more song, though.

01:09:33.243 --> 01:09:35.242
- I don't know if I feel like singing.
- (overlapping chatter)

01:09:35.243 --> 01:09:38.948
Oh, my God. Guys, I just want
to sing so bad.

01:09:40.684 --> 01:09:42.084
We really think you'll like it.

01:09:42.086 --> 01:09:44.051
You want to entertain me?

01:09:44.054 --> 01:09:46.120
(chuckling):
Knock yourselves out.

01:09:46.122 --> 01:09:47.856
Nine minutes.

01:09:47.858 --> 01:09:49.857
Let's make it a loud one, guys.

01:09:49.859 --> 01:09:51.759

Uh, yeah.

01:15:54.658 --> 01:15:58.226
I was gonna say something
earlier, but we were involved

01:15:58.228 --> 01:16:00.260

so I just...

01:16:00.262 --> 01:16:01.498

So they... yeah,
so they only picked her.

01:16:09.706 --> 01:16:13.040
Yeah, but I said no because
I feel exactly how you feel.

don't walk away from family.
