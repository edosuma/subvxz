ROBYN:
I serve as an equalizer.

00:03.438 --> 00:06.006
I'm the one you call
when you can't call 911.

00:06.049 --> 00:08.137
Previously onThe Equalizer...

00:08.182 --> 00:09.747
Come on, babe.

00:09.791 --> 00:12.099
Five years of freedom
from being hunted by the Feds.

00:12.141 --> 00:14.317
HARRY:
Five years of being stuck
underground.

00:14.362 --> 00:15.362
It's getting a little old.

00:15.406 --> 00:17.059
When I was working overseas,

00:17.103 --> 00:18.757
no one knew who I was.

00:18.800 --> 00:20.585
Maybe I was foolish
thinking I could do this work

00:20.629 --> 00:21.847
so close to home.

00:21.890 --> 00:24.675
Anything we do
risks exposing her.

00:24.719 --> 00:28.071
As hard as this is,
we just have to trust her.

HARRY:
Hold on a sec.
Let me get this straight.

00:36.600 --> 00:37.906
There's a truce
between you and the D.A.

00:37.950 --> 00:39.125
ROBYN:
She won't actively pursue me

00:39.168 --> 00:40.430
as long as I don't go too far.

00:40.475 --> 00:41.649
Have you met yourself?

00:41.692 --> 00:43.042
Too far is kind of
your brand.

00:52.616 --> 00:54.706
It's okay, I'm here.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.273
I saw the ghost again, Mama.

00:56.317 --> 00:57.491
Again?

00:57.534 --> 00:59.101
Well, let's check.

00:59.146 --> 01:01.365
No ghost down here.

01:01.408 --> 01:03.106
Not in here, either.

01:03.149 --> 01:06.762
Maybe it was just
another scary dream?

01:07.545 --> 01:09.634
Well, in that case,

01:09.677 --> 01:13.289
we're gonna have to put out
some ghost traps.

01:13.334 --> 01:14.813
Get some rest, sweetheart.

01:17.337 --> 01:19.861
I'll see you

01:40.621 --> 01:42.667
Best movie in the franchise
was the second.

01:42.710 --> 01:43.841
Then the third,

01:43.885 --> 01:45.147
then the first.ROBYN: Mm-mm.

01:45.192 --> 01:46.715
I cannot believe
you like the sequels more.

01:46.758 --> 01:49.109
It only got good
when Osiris was introduced.

01:49.152 --> 01:51.153
See, that's
the shiny thing distracting you

01:51.198 --> 01:55.418
from the nuanced,
tragic heroism of Captain Kojo.

01:55.462 --> 01:56.811
Wow.

01:56.854 --> 01:58.421
[chuckles]:
Okay, no. Aunt Vi.

01:58.466 --> 02:00.641
Please tell her
Kojo is so cringey.

02:00.685 --> 02:02.121
Okay, now which one's he?

02:02.165 --> 02:04.558
Abs or face?Face. Abs is dead.

[chuckles]:
Oh, no, no, girl. I like face.

02:05.864 --> 02:08.562
What? No.
Osiris is not dead.

02:08.605 --> 02:11.174
He got hit by an Eternity Ray.

02:11.217 --> 02:12.348
He is dead.

02:15.569 --> 02:16.875
I'm sorry, sweet girl.
I'm with her.

02:16.919 --> 02:18.528
Those abs are
out of commission.

02:18.573 --> 02:20.182
[chuckles]:
Okay. You know what?

02:20.227 --> 02:22.141
If Osiris is not
in the movie today,

02:22.185 --> 02:23.578
chili fries are on me.

02:23.621 --> 02:25.056
But if he is,

02:25.100 --> 02:28.147
I get to choose the music
on the car ride home.

02:28.191 --> 02:31.151
Oh, you are gonna regret that
because I'm gonna blast disco.

02:31.193 --> 02:32.413
Both ways.

02:32.456 --> 02:34.197
[chuckles]: No.
No, you're not.

02:34.240 --> 02:35.980
Yes, I am.

02:36.025 --> 02:37.199
Bad news.

02:37.243 --> 02:38.549
What? Work?

02:38.593 --> 02:40.682
I'm not gonna be able
to make the movie today.

02:40.724 --> 02:42.509
But can I get a raincheck?

02:42.552 --> 02:43.901
Can we see it next weekend
instead?

02:45.164 --> 02:46.426
No.No.

02:46.469 --> 02:47.862
No, I'm sorry, Mom.
Uh-uh.

02:47.906 --> 02:49.299
There's no way
I'm not seeing this movie today.

02:49.343 --> 02:51.780
This is gonna be
all over social media tomorrow.

We'll tell you how it was.

Oh, it's just like that, Kojo.

those Eternity Rays.

[quiet chatter]

03:17.675 --> 03:19.110
Where'd you find this?

03:19.155 --> 03:21.418
They were posted anonymously
to the dark web

03:21.461 --> 03:22.897
over the past two weeks.

03:22.941 --> 03:24.855
And you think this woman is
gonna be murdered?

03:24.900 --> 03:26.031
Yes.

03:26.074 --> 03:27.816
There's a guy in her house
filming her,

03:27.859 --> 03:29.338
and she has no idea.

03:29.383 --> 03:31.688
Abe and I are admins
in a Facebook group dedicated

03:31.733 --> 03:33.125
to saving her life.

03:33.168 --> 03:35.780
Some people call us
"armchair detectives."

03:35.824 --> 03:38.391
These videos,
they're threats.

03:38.435 --> 03:39.828
There are three in all.

03:40.610 --> 03:41.960
Who is she?

03:42.003 --> 03:43.745
That's the problem,
nobody in the group

03:43.788 --> 03:45.399
has been able to figure it out,

03:45.442 --> 03:46.921
which means we can't warn her

03:46.965 --> 03:50.664
that this creep is watching her
in her own home.

03:52.319 --> 03:53.754
[sighs]

03:53.798 --> 03:55.277
Have you shown this to police?

03:55.322 --> 03:57.801
NYPD say that the videos aren't
enough to go on.

03:57.846 --> 03:59.629
And anyone who
does believe us

03:59.674 --> 04:01.371
can't help.

04:01.414 --> 04:04.418
You sure it's not a scam,

04:04.461 --> 04:06.157
or some kind of promotion?

04:06.201 --> 04:07.115
There it is.

04:07.158 --> 04:08.421
She's no different
than the cops.

04:08.465 --> 04:09.813
Let's just go.Abe, wait.

04:09.858 --> 04:11.294
Why put yourself
through this again?

04:11.337 --> 04:12.990
Through what?

04:14.602 --> 04:17.560
Five years ago, I had a stalker.

04:17.605 --> 04:19.694
The cops assumed
the threat wasn't real

04:19.737 --> 04:21.261
until he tried to kill me.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.350
She has no voice.

04:23.393 --> 04:24.654
We're the only ones

04:24.699 --> 04:26.177
who can speak for her,
and this time,

04:26.221 --> 04:28.180
someone needs to listen
before it's too late.

04:28.223 --> 04:30.312
I'm listening.

04:30.356 --> 04:32.009
What makes you think

04:32.053 --> 04:33.490
this is happening in New York?

04:33.533 --> 04:35.404
Look.

04:35.449 --> 04:37.451
See that? The yellow?

04:37.494 --> 04:39.191
And it's not just
any yellow.

04:39.235 --> 04:40.802
It's RGB 255, 239, 0.

looking into this?

04:47.983 --> 04:50.725
[scoffs]
We've been investigating

04:50.768 --> 04:52.726
since the first video dropped.

04:53.509 --> 04:57.297
And what has your investigation
turned up?

04:58.384 --> 04:59.995
A suspect.

05:00.038 --> 05:02.345
Guy's name is Brandon Mackey.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.216
Everything points at him,

05:04.259 --> 05:06.915
and he needs to be stopped
because he's going to kill her.

05:07.742 --> 05:10.221
Even if he's doing these videos,

05:10.266 --> 05:11.875

05:11.920 --> 05:14.052
that's quite an escalation.

If this guy can do that
to an animal,

before he does it to a human.

05:43.821 --> 05:46.475
How the hell can anybody
do that to a living creature?

05:46.519 --> 05:48.478
'Cause he's a psychopath.

05:48.521 --> 05:50.000
He enjoys it.

05:50.045 --> 05:51.567
And he will not hesitate to kill
the woman he's stalking

05:51.612 --> 05:53.004
if we don't stop him.

05:53.048 --> 05:54.310
But why the videos?

05:54.353 --> 05:55.963
Because as much
as these armchair detectives

05:56.007 --> 05:57.922
want to take him down,
they're giving him an audience.

05:57.966 --> 05:59.576
Which is exactly
what he wants.

05:59.620 --> 06:00.576
HARRY:
I mean, true crime

06:00.620 --> 06:02.100
has become an industry.

06:02.144 --> 06:03.711
They're turning serial killers
into celebrities.

Now every Tom, Dick and Murderer
wants their own Netflix show.

And, yikes.
I mean, not to be sexist,

06:17.985 --> 06:19.769
but the women sure dig
the true crime, don't they?

06:19.814 --> 06:21.119
Well, focusing on the bad guys
shows us

06:21.163 --> 06:23.295
what red flags to look out for.

around as a potential suspect.

I suppose that isn't your fault,
either?

out of him.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.474
I'd do it again.

09:22.518 --> 09:24.302
Look.

09:24.346 --> 09:26.303
The videos have time stamps.

09:26.347 --> 09:28.654
I have alibis for all of them.

09:30.264 --> 09:31.961
I would never hurt anyone.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.225
[phone ringing]

09:35.662 --> 09:37.793
[shotgun clicking]

09:37.837 --> 09:40.057
[bullets clatter on ground]

09:44.105 --> 09:45.715
Yeah, what do you got, Harry?

09:45.759 --> 09:47.063
Rob,
a new video just dropped.

09:47.107 --> 09:48.587
The whole group's
talking about it.

09:48.630 --> 09:50.807
Creep's in her house
filming her folding laundry.

09:50.850 --> 09:52.678
And, Rob, there's a caption.

09:52.721 --> 09:55.682
"What would you do
with your last eight hours?"

09:55.725 --> 09:58.032
Your clients may have
been wrong about Brandon,

09:58.075 --> 09:59.642
but they're right
about the stalker's endgame.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.077
Yeah. He's escalating.

10:01.121 --> 10:03.645
Which means, whoever's
making these videos

10:03.690 --> 10:06.431
is gonna kill this woman, today.

10:15.788 --> 10:17.528
[phone line rings]We have less than eight hours

10:17.572 --> 10:19.139
before our stalker kills
this woman.

10:19.182 --> 10:20.620
Harry, tell me you got
something.

10:20.663 --> 10:21.924
How about this?
I may know

10:21.969 --> 10:23.927
where the stalker's been
posting his videos from.

10:23.971 --> 10:25.494
That's something.

10:25.537 --> 10:26.799
I've traced the videos.
They've all been posted

10:26.842 --> 10:29.019
to a dark web
video hosting site,

10:29.062 --> 10:30.412
with spoofed IPs,

10:30.455 --> 10:31.979
except for last Wednesday.

10:32.022 --> 10:33.763
He didn't change his proxy
settings on his anonymizer.

10:33.807 --> 10:35.982
Translation: He messed up.Yeah, big-time.

10:36.025 --> 10:38.201
So, I traced that video
back to an Internet cafÃ©

10:38.245 --> 10:39.639
in the city.

10:39.682 --> 10:41.118
I think that may be
his base of operations.

10:41.162 --> 10:42.990
This guy wouldn't just drop

10:43.033 --> 10:44.644
the videos and walk away.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.341
He'd want to see the reactions.

10:46.384 --> 10:47.734
Hear the applause.

10:47.777 --> 10:50.432
So if he just posted it,
he might still be there.

10:50.475 --> 10:52.389
[engine revs]

10:52.433 --> 10:54.957
[tires screeching]

10:55.001 --> 10:57.744
[laughing]:
Yeah, I know.

10:57.787 --> 11:00.442
But, no.
But it is a big deal.

11:00.485 --> 11:01.922
It means he likes her.

11:01.965 --> 11:04.315
So, first you exchange
Snapchats, then you text,

11:04.359 --> 11:07.014
and then if things are going
really well, you FaceTime.

11:07.057 --> 11:09.972
But how many years until you're
actually in the same room?

11:10.017 --> 11:11.322
Please. [chuckles]

11:11.365 --> 11:12.628
Ooh, I love those sweaters.
I'm gonna go look.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.543
Hurry up.
Movie starts in 20 minutes.

11:14.586 --> 11:16.370
I don't want to miss
the trailers.

11:23.291 --> 11:24.639
Oh. Hey.

11:24.683 --> 11:26.686
Hey, I was gonna buy that.

11:26.729 --> 11:27.990
That's mine.

11:28.034 --> 11:29.863
I just hadn't taken it
to the cash register yet.

11:29.905 --> 11:32.561
Oh. Well, I guess I could
say the same thing,

11:32.604 --> 11:35.259
considering I'm the one
who's holding it.

11:36.043 --> 11:37.347
Yeah...

11:37.392 --> 11:39.698
I don't have time for this.
Just give it to me.

11:40.481 --> 11:43.224
Excuse me?
Who do you think you are,

11:43.267 --> 11:44.528
talking to me like that?

11:44.572 --> 11:45.835
Oh, I can talk to you

11:45.879 --> 11:47.053
any way I want.

11:47.096 --> 11:48.837
[chuckles]

11:48.881 --> 11:50.230
No, you can't.

11:50.274 --> 11:54.278
Look, I'm not leaving here
until I get that robe.

11:55.889 --> 11:58.413
Well, then we've got a problem.

11:59.196 --> 12:01.633
Oh, now you're threatening me?

12:01.677 --> 12:03.722
Just give me the robe.

12:05.594 --> 12:06.812
I said give it to me!

12:06.855 --> 12:07.943
Stop that.

12:07.988 --> 12:09.510
What is wrong with you?Give it to me.

12:09.553 --> 12:10.990
Get off of me.[gasps]

12:11.033 --> 12:12.731
[scoffs]

12:12.774 --> 12:15.081
Aren't you going
to do something?

12:15.125 --> 12:16.038
She took my robe.

12:16.082 --> 12:17.083
She shoved me.

12:17.126 --> 12:19.086
I did no such thing.

12:19.129 --> 12:20.609
And they know it.

12:21.914 --> 12:23.873
[scoffs]
Fine.

12:24.655 --> 12:26.615
I'm calling the police.

12:29.052 --> 12:31.053
Go ahead. Call them.

12:31.097 --> 12:34.057
Yes, hi. Hi, I'm at a store
at Broadway and 60th.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.277
I'd like to report an assault.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.192
DELILAH:
Okay, wait.

12:38.235 --> 12:39.192
Hold on.
That's not what happened.

12:39.235 --> 12:40.323
I saw the whole thing.

12:40.368 --> 12:42.239
Oh, really?

12:42.283 --> 12:43.850
Tell it to the cops.

12:43.893 --> 12:45.590
See who
they believe.

12:45.634 --> 12:47.070
Come here, baby.

12:51.118 --> 12:53.033
[sighs]

13:00.039 --> 13:02.869
â™ª

13:06.220 --> 13:07.568
Hey!
Watch out!

13:08.613 --> 13:10.658
â™ª

13:12.529 --> 13:14.793
[panting]

13:17.447 --> 13:18.927
[yells, grunts]Fancy seeing you here.

13:18.971 --> 13:22.105
Wait. No, I kn--
I know this looks bad...What,

13:22.149 --> 13:23.628
skulking around the same place

13:23.672 --> 13:25.500
where the stalker posted
the videos? Or the running?

13:25.543 --> 13:26.806
'Cause I don't
like either.

13:26.849 --> 13:28.677
Look, I'm here
for the same reason you are.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.940
[exhales] A hacker friend
traced the videos for me,

13:30.984 --> 13:33.202
and I've been running
surveillance here for a week.

13:34.029 --> 13:36.510
Surveillance means
sitting on Brandon's house.

13:38.860 --> 13:41.254
Which means you knew
it wasn't Brandon.

13:41.298 --> 13:43.952
All right, fine. I knew.

13:43.996 --> 13:45.475
But I'm not the stalker.

13:45.519 --> 13:47.826
Then why send everyone looking
in the wrong direction?

13:50.003 --> 13:51.874
You wanted to
crack the case.

13:51.918 --> 13:54.834
You wanted to be the one
in the HBO documentaries.

13:54.876 --> 13:56.661
You didn't want Rachel
to hire me, did you?

13:56.705 --> 13:59.273
Look, I've been working
this case for months.

13:59.316 --> 14:00.534
Why should you get
all the glory?

14:00.577 --> 14:02.405
Glory?Ow! Ow!

14:02.450 --> 14:03.451
Glory?

14:03.494 --> 14:05.408
A woman's life is at risk.

14:05.452 --> 14:07.106
Now, you're gonna tell me
what you know.

14:07.149 --> 14:08.890
[groans]And if it wasn't
Brandon, that means

14:08.934 --> 14:10.893
you have something
that points to someone else.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.154
What?

14:12.198 --> 14:14.418
You got three seconds to
start talking or I start

14:14.461 --> 14:16.202
snapping fingers.Ow! Okay!

14:16.245 --> 14:17.682
Okay!
[pants]

14:17.725 --> 14:19.032
I found another video.

14:19.075 --> 14:22.904
An early one
that no one knew about. Look.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.255
Taken in the same room
as the cat video.

14:26.299 --> 14:27.909
See? It's the same wallpaper.

14:27.953 --> 14:30.129
I figure it must be
the stalker's home?

14:30.173 --> 14:31.783
What's with the bucket?

14:31.826 --> 14:33.960
You don't want to know.

14:34.003 --> 14:35.482
Here.

14:35.525 --> 14:37.745
Now, that?
That is the mascot

14:37.788 --> 14:39.661
for Red Brook High
School in Densburg.

14:39.703 --> 14:41.009
Upstate New York. It's tiny.

14:41.053 --> 14:42.706
And Brandon Mackey--
he's from Texas,

14:42.750 --> 14:43.926
not Densburg.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.710
[exhales]
Look, I-I only sat on it

14:45.754 --> 14:49.018
'cause I didn't want anyone
screwing up the investigation.

14:49.062 --> 14:50.498
I'm not a monster.

14:50.540 --> 14:51.977
You put a woman's life at risk

14:52.020 --> 14:54.806
so you could get
your 15 minutes.

14:54.850 --> 14:56.460
I don't see a difference.

14:56.504 --> 14:58.898
[phone ringing]

15:00.638 --> 15:01.943
Hey. What's up?

15:01.988 --> 15:03.336
Rob, we've been going
through the videos,

15:03.379 --> 15:04.424
and we found
something.

15:04.467 --> 15:06.121
In the killer's
latest video,

15:06.166 --> 15:07.731
the victim's front door
has a new lock.

15:07.775 --> 15:09.038
Must've just had it installed.

15:09.081 --> 15:10.474
It definitely was not there
before.

15:10.518 --> 15:11.822
MEL:
We're thinking the woman

15:11.866 --> 15:13.259
may have realized
she was being followed.

15:13.302 --> 15:16.784
Which means she may have
reported it to the police.

15:19.221 --> 15:20.658
That'll be $9.50.

15:20.701 --> 15:22.225
I got it.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.400
Thank you.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.837
What? Not used
to women paying?

15:26.881 --> 15:29.144
Not used to breezing
around with you in public.

15:30.015 --> 15:32.801
Don't have
to sneak around anymore.

15:33.671 --> 15:35.934
Does that take
the thrill out of it for you?

15:38.546 --> 15:40.330
Got something you need to watch.

15:40.374 --> 15:41.897
Dinner and a movie?

15:42.679 --> 15:44.246
Not that kind of movie.

15:44.290 --> 15:48.120
This guy's in her house
while she's asleep.

15:50.687 --> 15:52.864
You should've taken me
for drinks instead.

15:52.908 --> 15:53.822
What do you think?

15:53.865 --> 15:55.171
Your clients
are right.

15:55.215 --> 15:56.432
NYPD can't move on this.

15:56.476 --> 15:58.000
But I'll help if I can.

15:58.043 --> 15:59.044
You can.

15:59.087 --> 16:00.610
Do me a favor and
pull any reports

16:00.654 --> 16:02.744
of any women
calling 911

16:02.787 --> 16:04.572
about stalkers or
potential home invasions

16:04.615 --> 16:06.095
over the last two weeks.

16:06.139 --> 16:07.530
Sure.

16:08.315 --> 16:09.533
What is it?

16:10.317 --> 16:11.404
You see this?

16:11.447 --> 16:12.971
You recognize it?

16:13.798 --> 16:15.495
No. Do you?

16:15.538 --> 16:17.192
Guess you don't have boys.

16:19.326 --> 16:20.849
That's a Beyblade.

16:20.892 --> 16:22.981
You stack 'em up together
to make different kinds of toys.

16:23.024 --> 16:26.681
My sons love them, which means
I'm always stepping on them.

16:26.724 --> 16:28.465
I think this woman has a kid.

16:29.249 --> 16:32.164
And I only have a couple of
hours left to save them both.

16:33.687 --> 16:36.821
Blinds? Really? You got
all that based on blinds?

16:36.865 --> 16:38.735
Not just blinds. Cheap blinds.[phone rings]

16:38.779 --> 16:40.042
Blinds spe--
Oh, good.

16:40.086 --> 16:43.088
Hey, Robyn. Settle
an argument for us.

16:43.131 --> 16:45.047
Do I have to?It's case-related.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.397
Our mystery woman
sleeps in silk pajamas

16:47.441 --> 16:50.009
and has hundred-dollar hand
cream on her bedside table.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.488
Is that the
kind of woman

16:51.532 --> 16:53.750
who would also buy cheap,
plastic vertical blinds

16:53.794 --> 16:55.144
for her windows?

16:55.187 --> 16:57.581
You're thinking
she's in a rental property.

16:58.365 --> 16:59.322
Exactly.

16:59.365 --> 17:00.628
Or an Airbnb.

17:00.671 --> 17:02.629
Most likely built before 2006,

17:02.673 --> 17:04.848
because that's when that brand
of blinds was discontinued.

17:04.893 --> 17:06.328
Okay, what about
the new lock?

17:06.373 --> 17:07.765
Could've been installed
by a landlord.Fine.

17:07.808 --> 17:08.679
If it is a rental,

17:08.722 --> 17:09.984
it's probably a house,

17:10.028 --> 17:11.508
because there was
no intercom by the door.

17:11.551 --> 17:13.423
And listen to this-- back when
I was military intelligence,

17:13.467 --> 17:15.730
I may have borrowed
some NSA

17:15.772 --> 17:18.689
audio forensics software
I forgot to return.

17:18.732 --> 17:19.907
Used it to pick this up
from the video.

17:19.951 --> 17:21.692
[jet engine roaring]

17:21.736 --> 17:23.564
You hear that?
That's a commercial jet

17:23.606 --> 17:25.086
flying close overhead.

17:25.131 --> 17:27.088
So, wherever this house is,
I think it's in a flight path.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.352
MEL:
I mean, narrows it down some
but not enough.

17:29.395 --> 17:30.788
Well, might be enough.

17:30.832 --> 17:33.182
Dante came through
with a list of 46 women

17:33.226 --> 17:35.792
who called 911 about stalkers
or home invasions

17:35.836 --> 17:37.490
over the last two weeks.

17:37.534 --> 17:38.970
Names and addresses.

17:39.013 --> 17:40.798
I emailed 'em to you.

17:40.842 --> 17:44.105
Okay. Striking apartment
buildings, that leaves us

17:44.150 --> 17:44.888
with 13 houses.

17:44.932 --> 17:46.891
Only nine of which are

17:46.934 --> 17:48.371
in neighborhoods
under flight paths.

17:48.414 --> 17:51.243
Find out which ones
were built before 2006.

17:51.287 --> 17:52.375
And, Mel,

17:52.419 --> 17:53.549
let's make some calls.

17:53.594 --> 17:56.291
See if any of 'em are rentals.

18:01.689 --> 18:03.646
Okay, Aunt Vi,
let's just go.

18:03.691 --> 18:05.213
I mean, all we're doing
is giving her the attention

18:05.258 --> 18:08.086
she wants.We're not going anywhere.

18:08.130 --> 18:09.740
Why? We did
nothing wrong.

18:09.784 --> 18:12.002
We're gonna miss the movie
because this lady lost her mind?

18:12.047 --> 18:14.528
Sweetheart, we're staying.

18:14.570 --> 18:15.920
[entry bells jingle]

18:15.963 --> 18:17.487
[indistinct radio chatter]

18:17.530 --> 18:19.576
[speaking inaudibly]

18:19.619 --> 18:21.448
Scuse me.

18:21.490 --> 18:22.971
We're the
victims here.

18:23.013 --> 18:24.406
Quiet.

18:24.451 --> 18:26.670
â™ª

18:32.022 --> 18:34.634
We understand there was an
incident here a little earlier.

18:34.677 --> 18:35.766
Can you tell me what happened?

18:35.809 --> 18:37.202
I picked up this robe.

18:37.246 --> 18:39.161
That woman tried
to grab it from me.

18:39.204 --> 18:40.554
Yes, we understand
there was some confusion

18:40.596 --> 18:41.597
over a piece of clothing.

18:41.642 --> 18:43.817
I wasn't confused.

18:43.861 --> 18:45.689
I heard it got
a little physical.

18:46.603 --> 18:47.822
She was coming at me.

18:47.865 --> 18:49.953
I put a hand out
to hold her back.

18:49.998 --> 18:51.781
Look, I don't think
anyone wants a problem here.

18:51.826 --> 18:53.435
I think
what we could use

18:53.480 --> 18:54.959
is just a bit of closure.

18:55.002 --> 18:57.135
Are you asking me
to apologize?

18:57.179 --> 18:59.702
If we can't come
to a peaceful resolution,

18:59.747 --> 19:01.182
we will have to rely
on the statements taken.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.229
And if she wants
to press things further,

19:03.271 --> 19:05.144
that's what we'll have to do.

19:06.231 --> 19:07.580
I see.

19:07.624 --> 19:09.017
Well, fortunately, Officer,

19:09.059 --> 19:12.193
you won't have to rely
on the statements.

19:12.238 --> 19:15.022
My niece here got
the whole thing on video.

19:21.028 --> 19:23.509
Just give me the robe.

19:23.553 --> 19:25.207
I said give it to me.

19:25.250 --> 19:27.730
VI:
Get off of me.
What is wrong with you?

19:27.775 --> 19:29.906
Get off of me.[gasps]

19:29.951 --> 19:31.734
[Lori scoffs on video]

19:32.519 --> 19:34.781
I see.

19:34.825 --> 19:37.740
â™ª

19:42.920 --> 19:45.009
LORI:
Just give me the robe.

19:45.052 --> 19:46.663
I said give it to me.

19:47.403 --> 19:49.317
VI:
What is wrong with you?

19:49.362 --> 19:50.927
Get off of me.

19:50.971 --> 19:53.017
[scoffs]

19:54.932 --> 19:57.892
I'm sorry. Okay?

19:58.719 --> 20:00.502
Is that good enough?

20:01.548 --> 20:03.201
Thank you.

20:05.290 --> 20:09.076
Apologize
for the misunderstanding.

20:10.730 --> 20:12.471
Excuse me, Officer.

20:13.994 --> 20:15.170
Don't you
want to know

20:15.213 --> 20:17.215
if I want to press charges?

20:21.307 --> 20:22.351
Do you?

20:22.394 --> 20:23.613
No.

20:23.656 --> 20:27.529
I have no intention
of weaponizing the police.

20:27.574 --> 20:29.792
[scoffs softly]

20:31.577 --> 20:33.536
Let's go.

20:33.579 --> 20:35.798
â™ª

20:37.192 --> 20:39.193
Thanks.
Out of the houses I called,

20:39.238 --> 20:41.282
two were rentals:
Harlem and Bed-Stuy.

20:41.326 --> 20:44.112
But only Bed-Stuy
was built before 2006.

20:44.154 --> 20:45.721
There's another one
in Washington Heights.

20:45.766 --> 20:47.681
Manager said the renter moved
in a couple of months ago.

20:47.723 --> 20:48.855
Woman and a child.

20:48.898 --> 20:51.292
Wait, the child. Boy or girl?

20:51.336 --> 20:53.599
Boy.That's her. What's her name?

20:53.643 --> 20:55.078
911 report has her listed

20:55.123 --> 20:56.690
as Vicki Howell.
Lives off of Amsterdam.

20:56.732 --> 20:58.299
Let me see what else I can find.

20:58.344 --> 21:00.259
Do you have her number?Calling now.

21:05.394 --> 21:06.742
Okay, I got her.

21:06.787 --> 21:07.917
Rob, she's a blonde.

21:07.961 --> 21:09.528
Same as the woman in the videos.

21:09.571 --> 21:11.313
This is strange.
All I can find of her online

21:11.356 --> 21:12.749
are pictures of her
from high school.

21:12.792 --> 21:13.750
Where's the school?

21:13.794 --> 21:15.143
Red Brook High in Densburg.

21:15.185 --> 21:16.926
Same hometown as our killer.

21:16.971 --> 21:18.755
[beep]Vicki's not picking up.

21:18.798 --> 21:20.191
Rob, it's been seven hours.

21:20.234 --> 21:22.498
Which means
her time is almost out.

21:22.541 --> 21:24.369
â™ª

21:35.336 --> 21:37.121
[glass crunching]Vicki?

21:40.646 --> 21:42.344
Vicki?

21:46.000 --> 21:48.001
Vicki.

21:48.828 --> 21:50.482
What happened?He attacked me.

21:50.526 --> 21:51.744
He tried to kill me.

21:51.788 --> 21:53.702
He heard you knocking
and he ran out the back.

21:53.747 --> 21:54.748
Where's your son?

21:54.790 --> 21:55.965
He took him.

21:56.009 --> 21:57.576
You have
to find him.

21:57.619 --> 21:59.361
He took my son.

21:59.404 --> 22:00.405
â™ª

22:06.933 --> 22:07.978
VICKI:
He came out of nowhere.

22:08.021 --> 22:11.503
Tried to tie me up.

22:11.547 --> 22:14.070
So, I thought if I...
if I fought,

22:14.115 --> 22:15.898
if he kept hurting me,

22:15.942 --> 22:18.118
he wouldn't hurt Benji.

22:18.162 --> 22:22.078
Then he slammed my
head against the wall.

22:22.123 --> 22:23.690
And then I heard you
at the door,

22:23.732 --> 22:26.823
and he heard you, too.

22:26.866 --> 22:30.131
[crying]: Then he grabbed my son
and ran out the back.

22:31.261 --> 22:34.482
By the time I got back there,
they were gone.

22:35.309 --> 22:37.877
DANTE:
Vicki, did you recognize
the man who attacked you?

22:37.921 --> 22:39.836
Was he distinctive to you
in any way?

22:39.880 --> 22:42.448
Uh, he was covered.

22:42.490 --> 22:45.451
He had a long-sleeve
shirt, cargo pants.

22:45.493 --> 22:47.365
Nikes.

22:47.409 --> 22:51.065
He had gloves
and a-a ski mask, too.

22:51.107 --> 22:54.676
He was white. Slim.

22:54.721 --> 22:56.679
What was Benjamin wearing?

22:56.722 --> 23:00.422
A white sweater and jeans.

23:00.465 --> 23:02.381
You swear you'll find him?We're gonna do

23:02.423 --> 23:04.425
everything in our power
to find your son.

23:04.470 --> 23:05.949
ROBYN:
Vicki, we think
there's a possibility

23:05.992 --> 23:08.473
that your attacker knew you
from back in Densburg.

23:08.517 --> 23:10.476
Can you think
of anyone in your life

23:10.519 --> 23:12.041
who might want
to do this to you?

23:12.086 --> 23:13.173
DANTE:
Coworkers?

23:13.217 --> 23:15.175
Friends? Anyone from your past

23:15.219 --> 23:16.742
who might have resurfaced
recently?

23:16.786 --> 23:20.963
No. I-I wish I knew
why this happened, but I don't.

23:21.008 --> 23:23.227
I wish I had
seen it coming,

23:23.270 --> 23:25.969
but I-I didn't.

23:31.800 --> 23:34.281
I'll put a BOLO out
for her son and the attacker,

23:34.325 --> 23:36.109
and I'll get CSU
out to the house.

23:36.153 --> 23:37.851
But if the guy was
wearing gloves,

23:37.894 --> 23:39.548
doubt they'll find prints.

23:39.592 --> 23:42.898
Hey. Wasn't for
you, she'd be dead.

23:42.942 --> 23:47.121
We're gonna throw everything
we have at finding the boy.

23:50.124 --> 23:52.256
HARRY:
I got bad news.

23:52.299 --> 23:54.301
There's no security
cams on Vicki's rental.

23:54.345 --> 23:55.781
I scrubbed other home
and traffic cams nearby.

23:55.825 --> 23:58.740
There was no sign of the
killer or Benjamin on foot,

23:58.785 --> 24:01.265
and there were no cars
leaving the area

24:01.308 --> 24:03.006
after the killer escaped.

24:04.616 --> 24:06.140
Rob, you okay?

24:08.969 --> 24:10.449
Close your eyes.

24:11.928 --> 24:13.930
Okay.

24:13.973 --> 24:16.150
Describe what I'm wearing.

24:16.192 --> 24:19.761
[chuckles]
A camouflage sweater.

24:19.806 --> 24:21.938
Is it white, or is it cream?

24:21.981 --> 24:23.679
Uh,

24:23.722 --> 24:25.159
pants.

24:25.201 --> 24:28.336
Mm, pants with pockets?
I don't know.ROBYN: Okay.

24:28.378 --> 24:30.163
Now tell me
what Harry's wearing.

24:30.990 --> 24:33.123
His engineer boots.

24:33.166 --> 24:34.777
His double indigo
raw denim.

24:34.820 --> 24:37.387
His leather Western-style
shirt with the sterling snaps

24:37.432 --> 24:41.131
and his, uh, veg tan leather
belt with the vintage buckle.

24:41.174 --> 24:42.175
[chuckles]:
Okay, okay, let's stop

24:42.219 --> 24:43.307
before we get to the boxers.

24:43.351 --> 24:45.744
Why? That's
where it gets good.

24:45.788 --> 24:48.095
The fact
that you couldn't describe me

24:48.137 --> 24:50.009
as well as you did Harry
is normal.

24:50.052 --> 24:51.837
People don't retain
details like that,

24:51.881 --> 24:53.839
especially in trauma.

24:54.623 --> 24:58.018
Like describing a man who
attacked you in your own home.

24:58.060 --> 25:00.628
ROBYN:
So why did Vicki remember more
about her attacker

25:00.673 --> 25:03.501
than her own son
who she dressed that morning?

25:03.545 --> 25:05.199
And another thing. She said

25:05.241 --> 25:07.461
she didn't see it coming,
but she called 911

25:07.506 --> 25:09.550
to report a break-in,
said the cops did nothing,

25:09.595 --> 25:11.640
and now her child is missing?

25:11.683 --> 25:14.990
I was her, I would've been
all over Dante just now.

25:15.035 --> 25:16.818
She didn't even mention it.

25:16.863 --> 25:18.646
We're missing something.

25:22.651 --> 25:25.872
The killer had a mug
from Vicki's high school.

25:25.914 --> 25:27.394
Harry, can you
pull up a yearbook

25:27.438 --> 25:29.222
from Vicki's time at Red Brook?

25:29.266 --> 25:30.789
Yeah.

25:34.228 --> 25:36.185
RACHEL:
Vicki? Hi.

25:36.230 --> 25:38.101
I'm Rachel.

25:39.232 --> 25:40.756
They told me about you.

25:40.799 --> 25:44.586
You're one of the people
that was trying to find me.

25:44.630 --> 25:46.848
I am so sorry about your son.

25:46.893 --> 25:50.374
If it wasn't for you,
we'd both be dead.

25:53.202 --> 25:55.117
What made you help me?

25:56.292 --> 25:58.382
Because it happened to me,

25:58.425 --> 26:00.819
and I couldn't stop it.

26:01.690 --> 26:03.605
You needed to be there for me

26:03.648 --> 26:06.128
because you couldn't be there
for yourself.

26:08.348 --> 26:09.393
[keys clacking]

26:09.436 --> 26:10.873
HARRY:
Okay, these are

26:10.916 --> 26:12.570
all the photos I could find
from Vicki's yearbook.

26:12.614 --> 26:14.660
You think the guy who
attacked her is in these photos?

26:19.969 --> 26:22.231
ROBYN:
Yeah, I do.

26:22.276 --> 26:23.885
But I'm starting to think
it's not a guy.

26:23.930 --> 26:27.628
Harry, the picture of Vicki
in a softball uniform? Zoom in

26:27.673 --> 26:29.674
on the girl
in the background.

26:29.718 --> 26:31.589
HARRY:
You recognize her?

26:31.633 --> 26:34.156
That's the woman I rescued.

26:34.201 --> 26:35.636
What?

26:35.681 --> 26:37.813
HARRY:
"Amber Nelson."She's the stalker.

26:37.856 --> 26:39.597
I must've interrupted her
before she could kill Vicki,

26:39.641 --> 26:42.077
so she cut herself.
Played the victim.

26:42.122 --> 26:44.471
So, where is the real Vicki,
and where is her son?

26:45.298 --> 26:47.474
Right where
Amber left them.

26:49.607 --> 26:51.609
Dante.

26:58.790 --> 27:01.054
Vicki?

27:01.096 --> 27:03.317
Benjamin?

27:04.099 --> 27:05.928
[whimpers]

27:05.971 --> 27:08.191
AMBER:
So, the group you created.

27:08.234 --> 27:11.630
All those people.
They all saw the videos?

27:11.673 --> 27:14.849
We analyzed every frame of them
trying to find you.

27:15.676 --> 27:18.332
And you were all
going to watch my murder?

27:19.159 --> 27:22.902
No. I-I would've never tr...Well, maybe not you.

27:22.944 --> 27:27.645
But most everyone
wants to watch the car crash.

27:28.471 --> 27:30.038
I bet some people

27:30.083 --> 27:32.259
were looking forward to it.

27:35.044 --> 27:36.306
Rachel?

27:36.349 --> 27:37.567
What are you doing here?

27:37.612 --> 27:39.308
I came to see Vicki.

27:39.353 --> 27:41.094
We just had the
strangest conversation.

27:41.136 --> 27:42.748
Where is she?

27:54.324 --> 27:56.674
Thanks, Dante.

27:56.718 --> 27:59.852
Vicki and Benjamin
are safe.

27:59.894 --> 28:01.767
I should've seen it.

28:01.809 --> 28:04.029
Yeah, I should have, too.

28:04.073 --> 28:08.208
But psychopaths
are master manipulators.

28:08.990 --> 28:10.905
She asked about the group.

28:10.950 --> 28:13.082
It was almost like
she was excited

28:13.125 --> 28:15.040
about how many people
were watching.

28:15.084 --> 28:18.347
I was so obsessed, I threw an
innocent man to the wolves.

28:18.392 --> 28:21.351
Gave her the
attention she craved.

28:22.395 --> 28:24.963
Did I create a monster?

28:25.790 --> 28:28.707
You saved Vicki and her son.

28:29.576 --> 28:33.189
I just wish
I could've done better.

28:33.232 --> 28:35.409
Well, you still can.

28:35.451 --> 28:36.845
Use the group.

28:36.888 --> 28:38.367
Get Amber's name out there.

28:38.412 --> 28:40.195
The more people
we have looking for her,

28:40.240 --> 28:42.372
the faster we can find her.

28:45.419 --> 28:47.028
[indistinct radio transmission]

28:47.073 --> 28:50.771
All right.
NYPD's watching travel hubs,

28:50.816 --> 28:52.599
and all units are on
the lookout for Amber,

28:52.643 --> 28:54.906
but nothing yet.We need to figure
out her next move.

28:54.950 --> 28:56.430
You think she's got one?

28:56.472 --> 28:58.345
I mean,
Vicki's in protective custody.

28:58.387 --> 29:00.868
If I were Amber, I'd take
the "L" and go to ground.

29:00.913 --> 29:02.131
Amber doesn't
care about Vicki.

29:02.174 --> 29:04.829
She cares about
what she represents.

29:04.873 --> 29:08.571
Apparently, Amber and Vicki were
friends back in junior high,

29:08.615 --> 29:11.227
but in high school,
Vicki became popular.

29:11.270 --> 29:12.837
Amber resented it.

29:12.881 --> 29:15.753
Felt rejected. Became
creepily obsessed with becoming

29:15.797 --> 29:17.016
popular herself.

29:17.058 --> 29:19.800
Did everything she could
to get attention.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.585
Well, after graduating,
the attention seeking

29:21.628 --> 29:23.152
didn't stop.
She tried influencing.

29:23.195 --> 29:25.414
Auditioned for reality shows.

29:25.459 --> 29:27.766
Hi, guys.
My name is Amber Olsen.

29:27.808 --> 29:29.115
Never getting any traction.

29:29.157 --> 29:31.334
Until she posted
that animal abuse video.

29:31.377 --> 29:33.249
Exactly.
Now she's got her audience.

29:33.292 --> 29:35.469
And once she got it,
she didn't want to lose it.

29:35.511 --> 29:38.427
Amber needed an even
more compelling victim,

29:38.471 --> 29:40.299
and who better than
her old friend Vicki?

29:40.343 --> 29:42.432
Did you know
all of Ted Bundy's victims

29:42.476 --> 29:44.739
looked like the first girl
who rejected him?

29:44.782 --> 29:46.087
It wasn't about her.

29:46.132 --> 29:48.047
It was about the rejection.

29:48.089 --> 29:50.266
Amber doesn't care about Vicki.

29:50.309 --> 29:52.311
She cares about the attention.

29:52.355 --> 29:54.356
Keep an eye on the
Facebook group tonight.

29:54.401 --> 29:56.445
If she's gonna make a move,

29:56.490 --> 29:59.405
she's gonna do it there first.

29:59.449 --> 30:01.843
Yes, Abe, I know
the cops are looking for her,

30:01.886 --> 30:04.453
but we have to help.
We know who she is now.

30:04.498 --> 30:06.065
We can use the group to find her

30:06.107 --> 30:07.980
before she can hurt anyone else.

30:08.022 --> 30:10.025
Get all the admins online.

30:10.068 --> 30:12.201
I'll be uploading the info
in five.

30:12.244 --> 30:13.723
[gasps]

30:13.768 --> 30:15.335
Hello, friend.

30:18.337 --> 30:20.644
[door closes]ROBYN:
Boy, I swear, some days feel

30:20.688 --> 30:21.863
like years.

30:21.906 --> 30:23.821
So, how was the movie?

30:26.301 --> 30:28.782
Uh, we didn't go.

30:28.826 --> 30:30.959
LORI:
Aren't you going to do
something?

30:31.002 --> 30:33.482
She took my robe. She shoved me.

30:33.527 --> 30:35.181
VI:
I did no such thing.

30:35.223 --> 30:37.182
And they know it.[Lori scoffs]

30:37.226 --> 30:38.531
LORI:
Fine.

30:38.575 --> 30:41.230
I'm calling the police.Unbelievable.

30:41.273 --> 30:42.536
I know.

30:42.578 --> 30:46.105
I thought about posting it,
but...

30:46.147 --> 30:48.759
Aunt Vi handled it like a boss.

30:48.802 --> 30:50.673
You would have been
so proud, Mom.

30:50.718 --> 30:53.199
That was nothing
to be proud of, baby.

30:54.026 --> 30:57.855
I mean, but we stood our ground.

30:57.898 --> 31:00.162
We got what we wanted.

31:00.205 --> 31:01.684
[chuckles]:
No.

31:01.729 --> 31:05.732
What I wanted
was to go to the movies.

31:06.733 --> 31:08.257
What I wanted

31:08.300 --> 31:10.868
was to be presumed innocent.

31:11.781 --> 31:14.349
That cop went to that woman
and got her story first

31:14.394 --> 31:18.528
because her whiteness
was synonymous with truth.

31:18.571 --> 31:22.009
I am a middle-class
Black woman,

31:22.054 --> 31:24.272
and without that
phone, I would

31:24.317 --> 31:26.013
probably be sitting
in a jail right now

31:26.057 --> 31:30.932
because I was never going
to apologize to Miss Thang.

31:30.976 --> 31:33.152
What I really wanted to do

31:33.194 --> 31:36.198
was bitch-slap that heifer.

31:36.241 --> 31:38.679
But I couldn't.

31:40.159 --> 31:42.377
Yeah, I get that.

31:42.422 --> 31:45.032
I mean, but...

31:45.076 --> 31:48.123
we can't control
how they behave.

31:49.298 --> 31:52.213
Delilah Fulton,
don't you buy into that lie.

31:52.258 --> 31:54.128
Don't do it.

31:54.173 --> 31:55.695
I've been protesting

31:55.739 --> 31:59.003
all my life,
from sit-ins to George Floyd.

31:59.047 --> 32:01.920
Same fight over and over again

32:01.962 --> 32:03.224
to be seen,

32:03.269 --> 32:04.965
to be heard,

32:05.009 --> 32:07.446
to be human.

32:08.230 --> 32:11.145
And it hurts.

32:11.190 --> 32:13.974
And that hurt gets turned
into rage,

32:14.019 --> 32:18.587
because rage is...
is much easier to live with.

32:22.069 --> 32:24.202
If we had taken the...

32:24.246 --> 32:26.465
easy road today

32:26.509 --> 32:31.601
and left without being heard,

32:31.644 --> 32:34.473
that's what poisons our spirit.

32:36.824 --> 32:39.000
Don't do it, love.

32:39.044 --> 32:42.176
Don't buy that lie.
Don't let 'em sell you on that.

32:52.448 --> 32:56.322
Aunt Vi, you want me
to take care of this?

32:56.365 --> 32:58.019
VI:
It's not about
that woman today.

32:58.063 --> 32:59.412
It's about...

32:59.454 --> 33:03.807
It's about a lifetime of this.

33:05.548 --> 33:10.640
Just a million little cuts.

Harry, what's going on?

33:32.052 --> 33:34.447
An anonymous post just went up
on the group's message board.

33:34.490 --> 33:36.144
What'd it say?

33:36.188 --> 33:37.579
MEL:
"Stay tuned."

33:37.624 --> 33:39.278
She's about to make a move.

33:39.320 --> 33:41.845
She's already made it.
The post came with a picture.

33:41.888 --> 33:44.369
Rob, she has Rachel.

33:44.413 --> 33:46.414
And we have no idea
where she could be.

33:54.770 --> 33:56.990
[gasps, panting]

33:57.035 --> 34:00.038
[groans]
Comfortable?

34:02.648 --> 34:04.303
What are you doing?

34:04.346 --> 34:06.305
Making you a star.

34:09.221 --> 34:10.699
Guys, she's live.

34:12.224 --> 34:13.789
Look at this.
Audience is

34:13.833 --> 34:15.704
pouring in. There's
a thousand people watching.

34:15.748 --> 34:17.664
Dante just checked Rachel's
apartment. She's not there.

34:17.706 --> 34:19.360
Is there any way
to track 'em?

34:19.405 --> 34:20.536
That's what I'm trying to do.

34:20.579 --> 34:22.103
AMBER:
Look at those numbers.

34:22.146 --> 34:24.539
What an audience, huh?

34:25.367 --> 34:26.585
I told you

34:26.628 --> 34:28.543
they'd all want
to watch the show.

34:30.806 --> 34:31.590
Harry?

34:31.634 --> 34:32.940
Rachel's phone is off.

34:32.983 --> 34:34.114
The video feed IP

34:34.159 --> 34:35.463
is spoofed. I can't track it.

34:35.507 --> 34:36.509
Well, there must be some way
to find her.

34:36.552 --> 34:38.076
AMBER:
You found me.

34:38.119 --> 34:39.728
Good work, group.

34:39.773 --> 34:41.643
And you all remember Rachel,

34:41.688 --> 34:43.733
the women responsible
for all of this.

34:43.777 --> 34:46.693
Which is why you're
perfect for this.

34:46.735 --> 34:50.217
Because without you,
I wouldn't have an audience.

34:50.262 --> 34:52.132
I really should thank you.

34:52.177 --> 34:53.307
Go to hell.

Maybe, but I'll go famous.

35:03.797 --> 35:05.190
Harry, the window
behind Rachel--

35:05.233 --> 35:06.581
can you blow it up?

35:06.626 --> 35:09.628
[computer chirping]

35:09.672 --> 35:11.369
There. The blue trim
across the way.

35:11.413 --> 35:13.240
That's got to be unique.

35:13.284 --> 35:15.329
Not unique enough to find her
in time. She could be anywhere.

35:15.373 --> 35:17.766
Wait a minute.
You see that? Look.

35:17.811 --> 35:19.639
Underneath there--
you see that thin wire?

35:19.681 --> 35:21.161
I think that may be an eruv.
It's like a...

35:21.206 --> 35:22.771
It's a way to delineate
the holy area

35:22.815 --> 35:24.425
for Orthodox Jews
during Shabbat.

35:24.469 --> 35:26.427
Okay, so follow the wire,
find the blue trim.

35:26.472 --> 35:27.777
Find Rachel. How
big of a holy area

35:27.820 --> 35:29.170
could it be?Half the island of Manhattan.

35:29.213 --> 35:32.130
I could think
of a few other boroughs, too.

35:32.172 --> 35:33.478
Look, we could crawl
street view maps

35:33.521 --> 35:34.827
along the entire
length of the wire

35:34.871 --> 35:35.829
until we find some blue windows,

35:35.871 --> 35:37.177
but it would take us hours.

35:37.222 --> 35:38.483
I mean,
even-even if we divvy it up,

35:38.527 --> 35:39.572
there's just not enough of us.Sure there are.

35:39.614 --> 35:41.050
Time to give
our armchair detectives

35:41.094 --> 35:42.139
one more task.

See if the group recognizes it.

35:44.141 --> 35:45.621
AMBER:
Funny, isn't it?

35:45.664 --> 35:47.101
That you did all this

35:47.144 --> 35:49.320
just so you could
forgive yourself,

35:49.364 --> 35:52.802
and get rid of the stink
of having been a victim.

35:52.846 --> 35:56.065
Selfish and ironic, because

35:56.110 --> 35:57.764
you ended up the victim again.

I guess
that's just who you are.

Not anymore.

for who you are

a few minutes.

easy this time.

We did create her.

What I don't want to do is
give Amber any more attention

39:38.157 --> 39:39.768
than she's already gotten.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.422
Well, you'll be happy
to hear all of her videos

to undo the damage.

But the apologies from your
group was a good first step,

39:54.565 --> 39:57.351
and he's been cleared
from all the search engines.

39:57.394 --> 40:01.007
I'm going off-line, too.

40:01.050 --> 40:04.402
Right now,
I'm craving some anonymity.

40:07.360 --> 40:10.233
[indistinct chatter]

40:10.277 --> 40:12.365
Excuse me?

40:12.409 --> 40:14.454
Excuse me. Excuse me!

40:14.498 --> 40:16.978
I saw your keychain
the other day.

40:17.023 --> 40:20.286
Turns out real estate agents
are pretty easy to find online.

40:20.329 --> 40:23.246
What can I do for you?

40:25.030 --> 40:27.860
I'm sorry to bother you at work.

40:27.902 --> 40:29.643
I don't want a fight.

40:29.688 --> 40:35.389
But... my aunt was upset
after that thing at the store.

40:35.432 --> 40:37.913
Like, really upset.

40:37.956 --> 40:41.829
And I think
she has a right to be.

40:41.873 --> 40:44.659
But I just don't know
if you understand why,

40:44.702 --> 40:49.534
and maybe that's because you've
never been on the other side.

40:49.577 --> 40:54.539
So... I thought if you watched
the video I took,

40:54.581 --> 40:57.846
you could see what it
looked like from her, or

40:57.889 --> 41:00.501
our perspective.

41:00.545 --> 41:05.550
And maybe next time,
things could be different.

41:08.856 --> 41:11.206
You know...

41:11.251 --> 41:13.382
you seem like a nice girl.

41:13.427 --> 41:16.255
Very articulate
and civilized.

41:16.298 --> 41:20.215
Especially considering the kind
of people you were raised by.

41:20.260 --> 41:23.697
But if your aunt wants
to apologize,

41:23.742 --> 41:27.309
she can come do it herself.

41:32.925 --> 41:35.884
[phone whooshes]

41:35.927 --> 41:38.320
Hey, Lori?

41:42.195 --> 41:44.675
I just made you famous.

41:44.719 --> 41:49.070
[whooshing and chiming]

41:49.114 --> 41:50.594
Give me the robe.

41:50.637 --> 41:53.554
I said, give it to me!

41:53.597 --> 41:54.989
VI:
What is wrong with you?

41:55.034 --> 41:56.556
Get off of me!

41:56.601 --> 41:58.472
Are you serious?

41:58.516 --> 42:01.387
â™ª Another drop in the ocean

42:01.431 --> 42:03.432
â™ª Forgive me, forgive me

42:03.476 --> 42:05.260
â™ª And I will forgive you,
forgive you â™ª

42:05.304 --> 42:07.612
â™ª 'Cause I'd trade my money

42:07.655 --> 42:08.960
â™ª And all of my youth

42:09.003 --> 42:11.615
â™ª To settle the score
with you. â™ª
