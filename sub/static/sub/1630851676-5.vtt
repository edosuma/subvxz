to get attention.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.585
Well, after graduating,
the attention seeking

29:21.628 --> 29:23.152
didn't stop.
She tried influencing.

29:23.195 --> 29:25.414
Auditioned for reality shows.

29:25.459 --> 29:27.766
Hi, guys.
My name is Amber Olsen.

29:27.808 --> 29:29.115
Never getting any traction.

29:29.157 --> 29:31.334
Until she posted
that animal abuse video.

29:31.377 --> 29:33.249
Exactly.
Now she's got her audience.

29:33.292 --> 29:35.469
And once she got it,
she didn't want to lose it.

29:35.511 --> 29:38.427
Amber needed an even
more compelling victim,

29:38.471 --> 29:40.299
and who better than
her old friend Vicki?

29:40.343 --> 29:42.432
Did you know
all of Ted Bundy's victims

29:42.476 --> 29:44.739
looked like the first girl
who rejected him?

29:44.782 --> 29:46.087
It wasn't about her.

29:46.132 --> 29:48.047
It was about the rejection.

29:48.089 --> 29:50.266
Amber doesn't care about Vicki.

29:50.309 --> 29:52.311
She cares about the attention.

29:52.355 --> 29:54.356
Keep an eye on the
Facebook group tonight.

29:54.401 --> 29:56.445
If she's gonna make a move,

29:56.490 --> 29:59.405
she's gonna do it there first.

29:59.449 --> 30:01.843
Yes, Abe, I know
the cops are looking for her,

30:01.886 --> 30:04.453
but we have to help.
We know who she is now.

30:04.498 --> 30:06.065
We can use the group to find her

30:06.107 --> 30:07.980
before she can hurt anyone else.

30:08.022 --> 30:10.025
Get all the admins online.

30:10.068 --> 30:12.201
I'll be uploading the info
in five.

30:12.244 --> 30:13.723
[gasps]

30:13.768 --> 30:15.335
Hello, friend.

30:18.337 --> 30:20.644
[door closes]ROBYN:
Boy, I swear, some days feel

30:20.688 --> 30:21.863
like years.

30:21.906 --> 30:23.821
So, how was the movie?

30:26.301 --> 30:28.782
Uh, we didn't go.

30:28.826 --> 30:30.959
LORI:
Aren't you going to do
something?

30:31.002 --> 30:33.482
She took my robe. She shoved me.

30:33.527 --> 30:35.181
VI:
I did no such thing.

30:35.223 --> 30:37.182
And they know it.[Lori scoffs]

30:37.226 --> 30:38.531
LORI:
Fine.

30:38.575 --> 30:41.230
I'm calling the police.Unbelievable.

30:41.273 --> 30:42.536
I know.

30:42.578 --> 30:46.105
I thought about posting it,
but...

30:46.147 --> 30:48.759
Aunt Vi handled it like a boss.

30:48.802 --> 30:50.673
You would have been
so proud, Mom.

30:50.718 --> 30:53.199
That was nothing
to be proud of, baby.

30:54.026 --> 30:57.855
I mean, but we stood our ground.

30:57.898 --> 31:00.162
We got what we wanted.

31:00.205 --> 31:01.684
[chuckles]:
No.

31:01.729 --> 31:05.732
What I wanted
was to go to the movies.

31:06.733 --> 31:08.257
What I wanted

31:08.300 --> 31:10.868
was to be presumed innocent.

31:11.781 --> 31:14.349
That cop went to that woman
and got her story first

31:14.394 --> 31:18.528
because her whiteness
was synonymous with truth.

31:18.571 --> 31:22.009
I am a middle-class
Black woman,

31:22.054 --> 31:24.272
and without that
phone, I would

31:24.317 --> 31:26.013
probably be sitting
in a jail right now

31:26.057 --> 31:30.932
because I was never going
to apologize to Miss Thang.

31:30.976 --> 31:33.152
What I really wanted to do

31:33.194 --> 31:36.198
was bitch-slap that heifer.

31:36.241 --> 31:38.679
But I couldn't.

31:40.159 --> 31:42.377
Yeah, I get that.

31:42.422 --> 31:45.032
I mean, but...

31:45.076 --> 31:48.123
we can't control
how they behave.

31:49.298 --> 31:52.213
Delilah Fulton,
don't you buy into that lie.

31:52.258 --> 31:54.128
Don't do it.

31:54.173 --> 31:55.695
I've been protesting

31:55.739 --> 31:59.003
all my life,
from sit-ins to George Floyd.

31:59.047 --> 32:01.920
Same fight over and over again

32:01.962 --> 32:03.224
to be seen,

32:03.269 --> 32:04.965
to be heard,

32:05.009 --> 32:07.446
to be human.

32:08.230 --> 32:11.145
And it hurts.

32:11.190 --> 32:13.974
And that hurt gets turned
into rage,

32:14.019 --> 32:18.587
because rage is...
is much easier to live with.

32:22.069 --> 32:24.202
If we had taken the...

32:24.246 --> 32:26.465
easy road today

32:26.509 --> 32:31.601
and left without being heard,

32:31.644 --> 32:34.473
that's what poisons our spirit.

32:36.824 --> 32:39.000
Don't do it, love.

32:39.044 --> 32:42.176
Don't buy that lie.
Don't let 'em sell you on that.

32:52.448 --> 32:56.322
Aunt Vi, you want me
to take care of this?

32:56.365 --> 32:58.019
VI:
It's not about
that woman today.

32:58.063 --> 32:59.412
It's about...

32:59.454 --> 33:03.807
It's about a lifetime of this.

33:05.548 --> 33:10.640
Just a million little cuts.

[Vi sniffles]

33:30.486 --> 33:32.009
Harry, what's going on?

33:32.052 --> 33:34.447
An anonymous post just went up
on the group's message board.

33:34.490 --> 33:36.144
What'd it say?

33:36.188 --> 33:37.579
MEL:
"Stay tuned."

33:37.624 --> 33:39.278
She's about to make a move.

33:39.320 --> 33:41.845
She's already made it.
The post came with a picture.

33:41.888 --> 33:44.369
Rob, she has Rachel.

33:44.413 --> 33:46.414
And we have no idea
where she could be.

33:54.770 --> 33:56.990
[gasps, panting]

33:57.035 --> 34:00.038
[groans]
Comfortable?

34:02.648 --> 34:04.303
What are you doing?

34:04.346 --> 34:06.305
Making you a star.

34:09.221 --> 34:10.699
Guys, she's live.

34:12.224 --> 34:13.789
Look at this.
Audience is

34:13.833 --> 34:15.704
pouring in. There's
a thousand people watching.

34:15.748 --> 34:17.664
Dante just checked Rachel's
apartment. She's not there.

34:17.706 --> 34:19.360
Is there any way
to track 'em?

34:19.405 --> 34:20.536
That's what I'm trying to do.

34:20.579 --> 34:22.103
AMBER:
Look at those numbers.

34:22.146 --> 34:24.539
What an audience, huh?

34:25.367 --> 34:26.585
I told you

34:26.628 --> 34:28.543
they'd all want
to watch the show.

34:30.806 --> 34:31.590
Harry?

34:31.634 --> 34:32.940
Rachel's phone is off.

34:32.983 --> 34:34.114
The video feed IP

34:34.159 --> 34:35.463
is spoofed. I can't track it.

34:35.507 --> 34:36.509
Well, there must be some way
to find her.

34:36.552 --> 34:38.076
AMBER:
You found me.

34:38.119 --> 34:39.728
Good work, group.

34:39.773 --> 34:41.643
And you all remember Rachel,

34:41.688 --> 34:43.733
the women responsible
for all of this.

34:43.777 --> 34:46.693
Which is why you're
perfect for this.

34:46.735 --> 34:50.217
Because without you,
I wouldn't have an audience.

34:50.262 --> 34:52.132
I really should thank you.

34:52.177 --> 34:53.307
Go to hell.

34:53.351 --> 34:57.224
Maybe, but I'll go famous.

35:00.445 --> 35:01.925
this is the most popular

35:01.969 --> 35:03.753
I've ever been.

35:03.797 --> 35:05.190
Harry, the window
behind Rachel--

35:05.233 --> 35:06.581
can you blow it up?

35:06.626 --> 35:09.628
[computer chirping]

35:09.672 --> 35:11.369
There. The blue trim
across the way.

35:11.413 --> 35:13.240
That's got to be unique.

35:13.284 --> 35:15.329
Not unique enough to find her
in time. She could be anywhere.

35:15.373 --> 35:17.766
Wait a minute.
You see that? Look.

35:17.811 --> 35:19.639
Underneath there--
you see that thin wire?

35:19.681 --> 35:21.161
I think that may be an eruv.
It's like a...

35:21.206 --> 35:22.771
It's a way to delineate
the holy area

35:22.815 --> 35:24.425
for Orthodox Jews
during Shabbat.

35:24.469 --> 35:26.427
Okay, so follow the wire,
find the blue trim.

35:26.472 --> 35:27.777
Find Rachel. How
big of a holy area

35:27.820 --> 35:29.170
could it be?Half the island of Manhattan.

35:29.213 --> 35:32.130
I could think
of a few other boroughs, too.

35:32.172 --> 35:33.478
Look, we could crawl
street view maps

35:33.521 --> 35:34.827
along the entire
length of the wire

35:34.871 --> 35:35.829
until we find some blue windows,

35:35.871 --> 35:37.177
but it would take us hours.

35:37.222 --> 35:38.483
I mean,
even-even if we divvy it up,

35:38.527 --> 35:39.572
there's just not enough of us.Sure there are.

35:39.614 --> 35:41.050
Time to give
our armchair detectives

35:41.094 --> 35:42.139
one more task.

35:42.182 --> 35:44.097
See if the group recognizes it.

35:44.141 --> 35:45.621
AMBER:
Funny, isn't it?

35:45.664 --> 35:47.101
That you did all this

35:47.144 --> 35:49.320
just so you could
forgive yourself,

35:49.364 --> 35:52.802
and get rid of the stink
of having been a victim.

35:52.846 --> 35:56.065
Selfish and ironic, because

35:56.110 --> 35:57.764
you ended up the victim again.

35:57.806 --> 35:59.635
I guess
that's just who you are.

That's not who I am.
Not anymore.

I'm not responsible
for who you are

be it for you.

you're nothing, and you know it.

a few minutes.

at the source.

easy this time.

You don't sound so happy.

I still don't know how I feel.

In a way, Amber was right.
We did create her.

And Abe, withholding evidence?

39:32.804 --> 39:34.414
All for fame.

39:34.458 --> 39:36.112
I turned them down.

What I don't want to do is
give Amber any more attention

39:38.157 --> 39:39.768
than she's already gotten.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.422
Well, you'll be happy
to hear all of her videos

39:41.465 --> 39:43.163

from the Internet.

The only people who will
see 'em now will be on her jury.

39:48.646 --> 39:51.431
Might take a little more time
to undo the damage.

But the apologies from your
group was a good first step,

39:54.565 --> 39:57.351

from all the search engines.

39:57.394 --> 40:01.007
I'm going off-line, too.

40:01.050 --> 40:04.402
Right now,
I'm craving some anonymity.

40:07.360 --> 40:10.233
[indistinct chatter]

40:10.277 --> 40:12.365
Excuse me?

40:12.409 --> 40:14.454
Excuse me. Excuse me!

40:14.498 --> 40:16.978
I saw your keychain
the other day.

40:17.023 --> 40:20.286
Turns out real estate agents
are pretty easy to find online.

40:20.329 --> 40:23.246
What can I do for you?

40:25.030 --> 40:27.860
I'm sorry to bother you at work.

40:27.902 --> 40:29.643
I don't want a fight.

40:29.688 --> 40:35.389
But... my aunt was upset
after that thing at the store.

40:35.432 --> 40:37.913
Like, really upset.

40:37.956 --> 40:41.829
And I think
she has a right to be.

40:41.873 --> 40:44.659
But I just don't know
if you understand why,

40:44.702 --> 40:49.534
and maybe that's because you've
never been on the other side.

40:49.577 --> 40:54.539
So... I thought if you watched
the video I took,

40:54.581 --> 40:57.846
you could see what it
looked like from her, or

40:57.889 --> 41:00.501
our perspective.

41:00.545 --> 41:05.550
And maybe next time,
things could be different.

41:08.856 --> 41:11.206
You know...

41:11.251 --> 41:13.382
you seem like a nice girl.

41:13.427 --> 41:16.255
Very articulate
and civilized.

41:16.298 --> 41:20.215
Especially considering the kind
of people you were raised by.

41:20.260 --> 41:23.697
But if your aunt wants
to apologize,

41:23.742 --> 41:27.309
she can come do it herself.

41:32.925 --> 41:35.884
[phone whooshes]

41:35.927 --> 41:38.320
Hey, Lori?

41:42.195 --> 41:44.675
I just made you famous.

41:44.719 --> 41:49.070
[whooshing and chiming]

41:49.114 --> 41:50.594
Give me the robe.

I said, give it to me!
