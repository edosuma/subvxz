00:01.827 --> 00:03.351
Previously onCharmed...You may live as a happy family

00:03.394 --> 00:06.136
for the next two years,

00:06.180 --> 00:07.746
and then you may never
see Macy again.

00:07.790 --> 00:09.705
If you are to lay eyes
on her, she'll die.

00:11.620 --> 00:13.752
BOTH: No!MACY: The Harbinger's back.

00:13.796 --> 00:15.667
It's infecting all of Hilltowne.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.930
What if I can save the people
who have already been infected?

00:17.974 --> 00:20.846
Obalu Aye! K li fÃ¨t! Galvin!

00:22.370 --> 00:24.372
Parker, don't.
The Source will destroy you.

00:24.415 --> 00:25.721
You're not the only one.

00:33.903 --> 00:35.557
And I wiped the memories
of everyone in town.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.037
Macy, perhaps we should
discuss...

00:37.080 --> 00:38.908
I'm going to fix everything.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.849
It worked.

01:31.787 --> 01:33.093
Hey.

01:33.136 --> 01:35.660
Good morning.

01:39.011 --> 01:40.404
Have you been up all night?

01:40.448 --> 01:41.666
Wasn't tired.

01:41.710 --> 01:43.190
You needed rest.

01:43.233 --> 01:45.409
You saved the whole
town last night.

01:48.020 --> 01:50.153
Yeah, uh...

01:51.720 --> 01:54.331
I can't believe
I survived that. Uh...

01:54.375 --> 01:57.073
You...I'm fine.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.031
Yeah, I'm... I'm great.

02:00.642 --> 02:02.122
It's all going
to be great.

02:05.255 --> 02:06.561
Did last night really happen?

02:06.604 --> 02:08.258
Macy took on the Source?

02:08.302 --> 02:09.564
Yep,

02:09.607 --> 02:11.827
it happened.Is she still asleep?

02:11.870 --> 02:13.959
Did anyone even hear her
come home last night?

02:14.003 --> 02:16.266
I didn't hear her, but
maybe she can orb now,

02:16.310 --> 02:18.573
or-or portal or something
with her new powers?

02:18.616 --> 02:21.315
Right, Harry?Hmm? What?

02:21.358 --> 02:22.794
What does it mean that
Macy is the Source?

02:22.838 --> 02:24.927
Does she have
every power now?

02:24.970 --> 02:27.408
Do the laws of time and
space still apply to her?

02:27.451 --> 02:28.496
Well, they hardly apply
to you, Mel.

02:28.539 --> 02:29.714
MAGGIE:
Seriously, though,

02:29.758 --> 02:32.500
can Macy read minds?
Can she freeze time?

02:32.543 --> 02:34.545
Does she know we're having
this conversation right now?Oh,

02:34.589 --> 02:35.720
please, ladies.

02:37.026 --> 02:38.984
I'm sorry.

02:39.028 --> 02:40.638
The truth is I have no idea.

02:40.682 --> 02:42.292
This matter
is unprecedented.

02:42.336 --> 02:43.554
The power of the Source
hasn't been unleashed

02:43.598 --> 02:45.077
since before written language.

02:45.121 --> 02:46.514
And a witch
taking on the Source--

02:46.557 --> 02:48.211
a part-demon witch, at that--

02:48.255 --> 02:50.213
it's impossible to predict
the ramifications.

02:50.257 --> 02:51.997
I guess that sounds...

02:52.041 --> 02:53.869
fine.Terrifying.

02:53.912 --> 02:55.479
Why terrifying?Fine now?

02:55.523 --> 02:56.785
MAGGIE:
Well, I just mean that...

02:58.090 --> 03:00.223
...you know...

03:00.267 --> 03:01.485
it's Macy.

03:01.529 --> 03:03.357
She's a good person.

03:03.400 --> 03:06.011
She loves us. She would never
do anything to hurt us

03:06.055 --> 03:07.796
no matter how many
crazy powers

03:07.839 --> 03:09.363
she has.

03:09.406 --> 03:11.365
Plus, she has
the necklace from Mom.

03:11.408 --> 03:14.411
Mom said all she has to do
is touch it,

03:14.455 --> 03:16.631
exhale,
a-and she'll be balanced.

03:16.674 --> 03:19.460
That was before
she took on the Source.

03:19.503 --> 03:22.332
I know.
You're right.

03:22.376 --> 03:24.856
Mom would know
what to do.

03:24.900 --> 03:27.468
I wish she was still here.

03:28.947 --> 03:30.384
I never felt...

03:30.427 --> 03:33.256
scared when
she was alive.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.997
I know, Mags.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.347
I mean, it was scary enough
when we were just dealing

03:37.391 --> 03:39.610
with Macy's demon side.Seriously.

03:39.654 --> 03:42.091
Remember when she eviscerated
Alistair with her mind?

03:42.134 --> 03:45.137
I mean, not that I feel any
compassion for that demon dick,

03:45.181 --> 03:48.532
but all that rage coming
from her-- she was so brutal.

03:48.576 --> 03:50.186
Everything all right?

03:52.014 --> 03:53.581
Wait, was that...

03:53.624 --> 03:54.973
MAGGIE:
Galvin?

03:56.323 --> 03:57.367
Hey.

03:57.411 --> 03:59.413
But you're...Better than ever.

03:59.456 --> 04:01.458
After a close call.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.244
Isn't that great?

04:05.332 --> 04:07.290
Macy, your necklace is gone.

04:08.596 --> 04:09.988
O-Oh, yeah.

04:11.468 --> 04:12.948
I'm gonna head out.
Um...

04:12.991 --> 04:15.037
I'll call you later?

04:15.080 --> 04:17.735
Hmm?Okay. Bye.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.264
What did you do?

04:26.483 --> 04:27.832
Don't look at me like that.

04:29.312 --> 04:32.359
The Source and the Flame
are the same, remember?

04:32.402 --> 04:34.317
Its power is determined
by how you use it.

04:34.361 --> 04:36.711
And you've chosen to use it
to defy the laws of nature

04:36.754 --> 04:38.452
and magic
by resurrecting the dead.

04:38.495 --> 04:39.801
Excuse me?

04:43.370 --> 04:44.980
Sorry.

04:45.023 --> 04:47.809
My telekinesis is a little
sensitive, now that I have

04:47.852 --> 04:49.593
all this power.

04:49.637 --> 04:51.160
But I-I really don't
see the problem.

04:51.203 --> 04:52.988
All I did is bring back
one person.

04:53.031 --> 04:55.425
But Galvin died
to save others.

04:55.469 --> 04:57.340
It's likely there'll be
a cosmic reckoning.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.124
Death will exact its price.

04:59.168 --> 05:01.126
Then I'll fix that, too.

05:01.170 --> 05:03.433
And Mom brought me back.

05:04.739 --> 05:06.480
Am I against the laws of nature?

05:06.523 --> 05:08.177
I-I don't remember you

05:08.220 --> 05:09.874
judging her choice.This is different.

05:09.918 --> 05:11.833
Galvin chose to die.

05:11.876 --> 05:14.705
You took away his free will and
he doesn't even know about it.

05:14.749 --> 05:16.881
Coming from the woman who
rewrote her girlfriend's history

05:16.925 --> 05:18.143
without her knowledge.

05:21.233 --> 05:22.670
What happened to your necklace?

05:22.713 --> 05:25.107
I think it melted
when I took on the Source.

05:25.150 --> 05:27.414
But you need it.

05:27.457 --> 05:29.416
Mom said it would help you.

05:29.459 --> 05:31.722
Well, I'm sure Mom would
understand I had to sacrifice

05:31.766 --> 05:33.550
the necklace to save the world.

05:36.771 --> 05:39.382
Uh, I have Pilates.

05:39.426 --> 05:40.775
And I've got to go to work.

05:40.818 --> 05:42.646
Now that the world isn't ending.

05:55.311 --> 05:58.053
Maggie, I... I told you, I don't
think you should be around me.

05:58.096 --> 06:01.622
I know, but...
I need your help.

06:01.665 --> 06:03.363
What's all this?

06:03.406 --> 06:05.800
You know that thing
where your demon dad dies

06:05.843 --> 06:07.584
and you inherit
all of his torture tools?

06:08.716 --> 06:10.761
The man had a thing
for ball gags.

06:12.241 --> 06:15.679
Hey, um, look, we're
really worried about Macy.

06:15.723 --> 06:17.246
I need to know anything
your mom told you

06:17.289 --> 06:19.379
about taking on
the Source.

06:19.422 --> 06:22.077
She was terrified about
what the Source would do

06:22.120 --> 06:25.080
to a person psychologically.How so?

06:25.123 --> 06:28.431
Well, she suspected it would
feed off of human insecurity.

06:28.475 --> 06:30.738
Uh, she knew that if I took on
the Source, my Dad would be able

06:30.781 --> 06:33.567
to exploit my need to please him
and he'd be able to get me

06:33.610 --> 06:34.916
to do whatever he wanted.

06:34.959 --> 06:37.484
What could that mean for Macy?

06:37.527 --> 06:40.487
Oh, um, her
deepest insecurity?

06:40.530 --> 06:43.011
I... I don't know.

06:43.054 --> 06:45.927
Come on, you're a psych major.

06:47.319 --> 06:49.931
Macy's deepest
insecurity.

06:51.367 --> 06:53.500
I guess being abandoned.

06:53.543 --> 06:56.154
I mean, because of how
she grew up, with...

06:56.198 --> 06:58.200
without Mom,
without us.

06:58.243 --> 07:01.246
That sounds right.

07:01.290 --> 07:03.510
Wait.

07:05.207 --> 07:06.904
When my dad was prepping me
to take on the Source,

07:06.948 --> 07:09.080
h-he kept talking
about some spell.

07:09.124 --> 07:11.735
The missing page from
The Book of Shadows.

07:11.779 --> 07:14.259
The one Lucy stole.Lucy?

07:14.303 --> 07:16.784
He was mesmerizing her.

07:16.827 --> 07:19.482
Oh. That explains
why she was acting

07:19.526 --> 07:22.006
weirder than usual.Weirder than usual?

07:22.050 --> 07:23.617
Yeah.

07:23.660 --> 07:26.794
Parker, we have
to find that page.Yeah.

07:26.837 --> 07:29.013
It might be the only way
to save Macy.

07:31.189 --> 07:33.627
Galvin, wait up.

07:33.670 --> 07:35.193
Hey.

07:35.237 --> 07:36.934
Are you all right?

07:36.978 --> 07:40.285
Two patients I cured of
the Harbinger virus just died.

07:40.329 --> 07:42.853
Sudden cardiac arrest.

07:42.897 --> 07:45.639
The thing is,
I remembered I sacrificed myself

07:45.682 --> 07:47.162
to save those people.

07:47.205 --> 07:49.469
But I didn't die.

07:49.512 --> 07:51.862
And now they're dead?

07:56.040 --> 07:58.826
Macy brought me back to life,
didn't she?

07:59.870 --> 08:00.828
She did.

08:02.177 --> 08:03.831
See, I-I knew I just...

08:03.874 --> 08:05.920
I feel so off.

08:05.963 --> 08:07.791
Like-like I don't belong here.

08:09.663 --> 08:13.101
I was at peace with dying.

08:13.144 --> 08:15.973
I wanted to save those people.

08:16.017 --> 08:17.453
And now...

08:18.498 --> 08:20.543
Death is exacting its price.

08:20.587 --> 08:23.546
Look, whatever's inside her
making her do these things,

08:23.590 --> 08:25.548
you got to get it out, Mel.

08:25.592 --> 08:27.594
Please.

08:41.999 --> 08:44.175
MACY:
Come in.

08:49.311 --> 08:51.356
I sensed that you were
about to knock.

08:53.228 --> 08:55.622
Guess that's another one
of my powers.

08:55.665 --> 08:57.885
May I?Yeah, yeah.

09:05.022 --> 09:08.460
I just wanted to check in,
see how you were feeling.

09:10.114 --> 09:12.595
This must be overwhelming.

09:12.639 --> 09:15.076
For you all more
than me, I think.

09:15.119 --> 09:17.252
I know Mel and Maggie
were making excuses

09:17.295 --> 09:18.993
to leave the house.

09:19.036 --> 09:20.864
I heard them talking about
how they want their mother

09:20.908 --> 09:22.866
because they're scared of me.

09:22.910 --> 09:24.564
Like I'm some monster
hiding under the bed.

09:24.607 --> 09:27.436
Macy, they're not scared of you.

09:27.479 --> 09:31.353
They want to help you,
because you're their sister

09:31.396 --> 09:34.138
and we all love you.

09:37.664 --> 09:41.232
I can read thoughts now, too.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.455
Yes, well...

09:46.498 --> 09:48.718
uh, in any event,
I suggest you take it slow

09:48.762 --> 09:51.286
when using these new powers.

09:52.766 --> 09:55.682
Mel told me
two patients Galvin saved

09:55.725 --> 09:59.120
when he sacrificed himself
have just died.

09:59.163 --> 10:02.079
Well, then,
I will bring them back.

10:02.123 --> 10:04.647
Macy, destiny will keep
reasserting itself.

10:04.691 --> 10:06.083
Sorry.

10:07.258 --> 10:09.260
Um...

10:12.089 --> 10:13.656
What is it?

10:13.700 --> 10:18.095
Ah, uh...
women's studies business.

10:18.139 --> 10:19.923
A reminder I have
a faculty meeting.

10:19.967 --> 10:22.143
We'll talk later.

10:22.186 --> 10:24.972
Please, remember what I said
about taking it slow.

10:25.015 --> 10:26.756
Mm-hmm.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.421
HARRY:
The missing page. Good job.

10:39.464 --> 10:40.683
MEL:
Seriously, Mags,

10:40.727 --> 10:42.772
good find.I got skills.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.252
Parker helped a little.

10:44.295 --> 10:46.994
So, um, what does it mean?

10:47.037 --> 10:48.648
I wish I knew,
but this language

10:48.691 --> 10:50.301
is completely unfamiliar.

10:50.345 --> 10:52.521
Perhaps we need to work out
where this pyramid is.Wait...

10:52.564 --> 10:55.350
what if it's not a pyramid?

10:55.393 --> 10:57.265
What if it's a prism?What do you mean?

10:57.308 --> 10:59.963
The prism. The one
"fake Ouija board Mom" used

11:00.007 --> 11:01.443
when she tried
to steal our powers.

11:01.486 --> 11:03.097
The one inside
that mirror.

11:03.140 --> 11:05.099
You've all been
lying to me.

11:05.142 --> 11:06.361
Macy.I can explain.

11:06.404 --> 11:08.189
You don't trust me?

11:08.232 --> 11:10.060
You think I'm crazy?

11:10.104 --> 11:12.062
What you did to Galvin--

11:12.106 --> 11:14.238
there was collateral damage.

11:14.282 --> 11:17.024
The patients he saved--
they keep dying.

11:17.067 --> 11:18.852
Then I will keep
bringing them back.

11:18.895 --> 11:21.115
And cause more
collateral damage?

11:22.333 --> 11:23.552
I talked to him.

11:23.595 --> 11:25.859
He says he feels

11:25.902 --> 11:27.643
dislocated.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.253
Galvin knows he was
supposed to die.

11:29.297 --> 11:32.039
You told him?

11:35.956 --> 11:37.740
He knew something
was wrong.

11:37.784 --> 11:41.483
Our mother did the same thing.

11:41.526 --> 11:43.224
Why can't you
understand?

11:43.267 --> 11:45.661
You're all terrified of me.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.489
N-No.
No, no.
No.

11:47.532 --> 11:48.795
That-That's not...MACY: It's okay.

11:48.838 --> 11:50.884
It's okay.
I-I can fix it

11:50.927 --> 11:52.886
so you won't
be scared.

11:52.929 --> 11:55.366
I know what you need
to feel safe.

11:56.628 --> 11:59.109
Her.

11:59.153 --> 12:01.285
I can bring her back.Macy, no!

12:10.730 --> 12:12.383
It worked.

12:13.776 --> 12:15.996
Macy?

12:16.039 --> 12:18.041
Hey.

12:18.085 --> 12:20.740
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
you can't be here right now.

12:20.783 --> 12:22.176
You ca...

12:24.961 --> 12:27.442
Oh, my...

12:27.485 --> 12:28.878
No.

12:28.922 --> 12:30.793
Oh...

12:30.837 --> 12:32.577
No. No.

12:39.628 --> 12:42.805
No, no, come back.Macy, the curse...

12:42.849 --> 12:45.677
I can't be... near you.

12:45.721 --> 12:49.507
Oh, God. This wasn't
supposed to happen.

12:49.551 --> 12:50.813
This was supposed
to fix everything,

12:50.857 --> 12:52.119
Mom!

12:52.162 --> 12:53.816
Who the hell are you?

12:53.860 --> 12:55.818
I'm Macy.
I'm-I'm your sister.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.081
I-I'm trying to help you.
Um...

12:58.125 --> 12:59.430
Your-your mom died,

12:59.474 --> 13:00.780
and so I-I brought
her back.

13:00.823 --> 13:01.955
What are you talking about?

13:01.998 --> 13:03.783
She must be
some kind of demon.

13:03.826 --> 13:05.959
Mel, do something!No!

13:06.002 --> 13:07.482
Aah!Aah!

13:07.525 --> 13:10.180
Uh... Oh, God. No, uh...

13:10.224 --> 13:12.095
Uh, uh...

13:12.139 --> 13:13.488
I don't know what kind
of demon she is,

13:13.531 --> 13:14.750
but she's really
freaking strong.

13:16.534 --> 13:20.190
Oh, my God.
Mel, I think she's dead.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.541
Maggie, don't worry,

13:23.585 --> 13:26.501
I can just bring her back again.

13:26.544 --> 13:27.981
That was the whole point.

13:28.024 --> 13:29.721
I-I brought her back
because you need her.

13:29.765 --> 13:31.027
Stay away from our mother.

13:31.071 --> 13:33.334
She's my mother, too.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.640
Just listen, I can help.
I...

13:35.684 --> 13:37.338
I took on the Source.

13:37.381 --> 13:38.687
The Source of All Evil?Let me explain.

13:38.730 --> 13:39.993
We don't want to hear

13:40.036 --> 13:41.864
your explanation.I'm your sister.

13:41.908 --> 13:43.692
You don't need
to be scared of me.

13:43.735 --> 13:46.173
We're all supposed to be
together, with our mother.

13:46.216 --> 13:48.088
You are not our sister.

13:50.220 --> 13:52.570
You have always
been the problem.

13:53.745 --> 13:55.835
From the beginning,

13:55.878 --> 13:58.533
you refused to let me in.

13:58.576 --> 14:00.883
Get the hell away from us
before I kill you.

14:05.018 --> 14:07.194
Welcome to
Handy Dandy Snacks.

14:07.237 --> 14:09.065
Interested in trying
our new freeze-dried

14:09.109 --> 14:11.676
plantain chips?
100% GMO free.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.765
Knansie, we need to talk.

14:13.809 --> 14:15.245
HARRY:
Not that a vegan sausage

14:15.289 --> 14:17.073
has any business calling
itself a sausage.

14:17.117 --> 14:19.119
I love your accent.Why, thank you.

14:19.162 --> 14:21.034
I wish I could say the same
for your tea selection.

14:23.601 --> 14:25.081
Excuse me.

14:26.953 --> 14:29.129
We know each other,
don't we?

14:29.172 --> 14:30.304
No.

14:30.347 --> 14:31.696
Yes, we do.
I'm certain.

14:33.829 --> 14:35.439
Crap.

14:35.483 --> 14:36.963
Of course you're a demon.

14:37.006 --> 14:38.573
I need that job, you know.

14:38.616 --> 14:40.880
It's not like being a
necromancer pays the bills.Listen.

14:40.923 --> 14:43.099
You brought me back to life.

14:45.797 --> 14:48.235
Right.
I remember.

14:48.278 --> 14:49.932
So what do you want from me now?

14:49.976 --> 14:53.762
When you resurrected me,
you exacted a sacrifice.

14:53.805 --> 14:55.546
My mother and I
had to stay apart

14:55.590 --> 14:57.766
or one of us would die.

14:57.809 --> 15:00.856
But I need to be
with her now.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.553
Okay.

15:02.597 --> 15:04.947
So you just need
a different sacrifice.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.601
But unless you're, like,
some kind of god

15:06.644 --> 15:08.081
who can rewrite
history or something,

15:08.124 --> 15:09.952
tough chance
making that happen.

15:11.823 --> 15:15.262
Oh, you aresome kind of god.

15:15.305 --> 15:18.265
And I know
the perfect sacrifice.

15:24.575 --> 15:26.708
You're still up?

15:26.751 --> 15:28.753
That lab works you too hard.

15:31.321 --> 15:33.976
I'm going to bed.
Don't stay up too late.

15:34.020 --> 15:37.806
Hey, Mom, thanks for letting me
do my laundry here.

15:37.849 --> 15:39.808
Are you heading back to Kappa?

15:39.851 --> 15:42.506
Yeah.Okay.

15:43.855 --> 15:45.553
It's just me and Mom here.

15:45.596 --> 15:47.772
Yeah.

15:47.816 --> 15:50.514
Just the way you like it,
weirdo.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.098
Ah, good evening.

16:09.142 --> 16:10.447
That was even faster

16:10.491 --> 16:12.406
than the seven minutes
promised by the app.Mm.

16:12.449 --> 16:14.147
What can I say?
I drive fast.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.540
And you are Harry?

16:16.584 --> 16:19.717
And you're Mel.
Nice to meet you.

16:22.372 --> 16:24.374
Whoa! Stop!

16:25.419 --> 16:27.377
So what brings you to Seattle?

16:27.421 --> 16:28.900
Women's studies conference.

16:28.944 --> 16:30.380
Hmm.

16:31.773 --> 16:33.818
I like your bracelet.

16:36.299 --> 16:37.953
Women's studies conference?

16:37.997 --> 16:39.259
I'm a women's studies professor.

16:39.302 --> 16:40.521
Head of my faculty, in fact.

16:40.564 --> 16:41.652
A cis male head

16:41.696 --> 16:43.089
of the women's studies
department?

16:43.132 --> 16:45.439
I know how it sounds,
but this cis male

16:45.482 --> 16:48.181
has been published 12 times
by respected feminist journals

16:48.224 --> 16:51.314
and retweeted by Roxane Gay.
Check Twitter.

16:51.358 --> 16:54.013
You'll have to scroll back
a bit. She's quite prolific.

16:55.927 --> 16:58.191
Why do I feel I've said
precisely that before?

16:58.234 --> 17:00.628
I'm having
the strongest dÃ©jÃ  vu.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.458
Anyway, where do you teach?

17:04.501 --> 17:06.503
Hilltowne University, Michigan.

17:06.547 --> 17:09.550
Really?
I was born in Hilltowne.

17:09.593 --> 17:12.596
You were?
Oh, what a coincidence.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.772
But my dad and I moved
after my mom died.

17:14.816 --> 17:16.687
Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry.

17:16.731 --> 17:19.777
I was only two when it happened.
I don't really remember her.

17:19.821 --> 17:22.041
Have we met before?
I feel like

17:22.084 --> 17:23.172
I know you.

17:26.306 --> 17:27.568
WOMAN: Move it!
Uh...

17:29.526 --> 17:32.094
You're a witch.Huh?

17:33.139 --> 17:34.270
And what are you?

17:34.314 --> 17:35.532
I'm a Whitelighter.

17:35.576 --> 17:37.273
Something's happening to us.

17:37.317 --> 17:39.710
Memories are colliding
in our brains, it's

17:39.754 --> 17:40.972
a side effect
of something.

17:41.016 --> 17:43.149
Aah!Aah!

17:43.192 --> 17:45.020
As is this horrible pain.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.804
We must restore
our memories.

17:46.848 --> 17:47.936
I-I know.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.641
Whoa.

17:57.685 --> 17:59.339
What is this place?

17:59.382 --> 18:02.559
The power source for all
Whitelighters. In here lies

18:02.603 --> 18:05.301
a potion that allows select
Whitelighters to regain

18:05.345 --> 18:07.695
their past memories once they
retire from service.

18:07.738 --> 18:09.044
If we can break in.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.047
Now, my hunch is that

18:12.091 --> 18:15.181
we're victims
of some kind of altered reality.

18:19.794 --> 18:22.884
We need the memories
from our reality to stop this.

18:22.927 --> 18:24.146
That bracelet
controls time.

18:24.190 --> 18:25.582
Mm-hmm.Good.

18:25.626 --> 18:27.497
We'll need it.
It will take me hours

18:27.541 --> 18:29.151
to crack the code
and open this vault.

18:29.195 --> 18:31.545
Let's do this.

18:44.601 --> 18:46.429
We'll need something
to put it in.

18:55.743 --> 18:56.961
Drink.

19:03.272 --> 19:05.492
Harry, it's you.

19:09.583 --> 19:12.063
Quickly, we need to
get back to Hilltowne.

19:16.285 --> 19:19.201
How do we even know Maggie
and Macy live in Hilltowne?

19:19.245 --> 19:21.595
In this world?Well, don't be silly,

19:21.638 --> 19:24.380
of course I know.
I'm their Whitelighter.

19:24.424 --> 19:25.468
You are?

19:25.512 --> 19:26.904
But how are we even
the Charmed Ones

19:26.948 --> 19:28.297
if Mom never
brought us together?

19:28.341 --> 19:31.518
You're not, but the fact
you still have your powers

19:31.561 --> 19:33.955
means there are some things
even Macy cannot control.

19:33.998 --> 19:36.000
Destiny asserting itself.

19:36.044 --> 19:37.263
There she is.

19:37.306 --> 19:38.960
Now, prepare yourself.

19:39.003 --> 19:40.353
MAGGIE:
Hey, followers.

19:40.396 --> 19:41.789
It's Margarita On the Rocks

19:41.832 --> 19:43.660
at the corner of
"I Woke Up Like This"

19:43.704 --> 19:46.141
and "Flex, Girl, Flex."
Heading out

19:46.185 --> 19:47.708
for the night with my new

19:47.751 --> 19:50.798
lash extensions,
hashtag ad.

19:50.841 --> 19:53.061
This is the Maggie
that grew up without me?

19:53.104 --> 19:55.150
She's basically Olivia Jade.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.630
Well, don't be
too hard on her.

19:56.673 --> 19:58.893
She's lonely,
estranged from Macy

19:58.936 --> 20:01.504
and your mother.What?

20:01.548 --> 20:04.942
I'll be back lates to tell you
the scoop on what I'm dranking.

20:04.986 --> 20:06.640
Spoiler alert: it's pink,

20:06.683 --> 20:09.251
fizzy, and potent.

20:13.168 --> 20:15.170
Hey, I know you, don't I?

20:21.394 --> 20:24.005
Harry, what's going on?

20:24.048 --> 20:26.442
Drink this,
all will become clear.

20:34.276 --> 20:35.495
Mel.

20:35.538 --> 20:36.670
Hi.

20:39.281 --> 20:43.242
Macy's, like, next-level
cray in this reality.

20:44.286 --> 20:46.419
Sorry, too much vlogging.

20:46.462 --> 20:49.291
Anyways, she's, like,
hyper-possessive of Mom,

20:49.335 --> 20:50.814
always has to know
where she is,

20:50.858 --> 20:52.599
doesn't want me
to get in between them.

20:52.642 --> 20:54.862
The vibe was so weird
I, like, moved into Kappa.

20:54.905 --> 20:57.299
I think she's trying
to keep Mom alive.

20:57.343 --> 21:00.084
Which is why she's
changing realities.

21:07.918 --> 21:09.790
Your prism.

21:09.833 --> 21:11.748
Now we just need that page
from the Book.

21:11.792 --> 21:13.228
Let's hope it exists
in this reality, because

21:13.272 --> 21:14.969
it's the only way
I can think of to stop her.

21:15.012 --> 21:16.753
Stop me?

21:16.797 --> 21:18.755
No.

21:18.799 --> 21:21.323
You're not going to stop me,
and definitely not with that.

21:24.631 --> 21:27.068
You.

21:27.111 --> 21:30.332
You aren't supposed to be here.

21:30.376 --> 21:33.640
She's the sacrifice to keep
Mom alive. Stay away from us.

21:33.683 --> 21:34.989
Macy, stop!

21:41.691 --> 21:43.737
We need to work out
how to stop this.

21:43.780 --> 21:45.347
Macy's right.

21:45.391 --> 21:47.567
You have to keep me away
from Mom or she'll die.

21:47.610 --> 21:50.178
Mel, don't you see?
Marisol was meant to die.

21:50.221 --> 21:52.833
Destiny will assert itself.

21:52.876 --> 21:54.835
Mm.

22:04.453 --> 22:07.064
No... No!

22:07.108 --> 22:09.415
Mom.

22:11.112 --> 22:12.722
We didn't bring Mel.

22:18.946 --> 22:21.252
But it happened anyway,
didn't it?

22:24.430 --> 22:25.692
I can bring her back.

22:25.735 --> 22:27.737
Macy, no.

22:27.781 --> 22:30.914
The truth will always out.
Can't you see that?

22:32.916 --> 22:34.527
You have to stop this.

22:34.570 --> 22:36.093
Macy, please, he's right.

22:39.009 --> 22:40.794
I tried.

22:42.839 --> 22:45.407
I tried to help us all
be together.

22:47.453 --> 22:50.369
I thought bringing Mom back
would help you feel safe.

22:53.459 --> 22:55.199
But she still died.

22:57.201 --> 22:58.681
And then I decided...

23:01.162 --> 23:02.990
I just wanted her.

23:06.472 --> 23:09.475
Why should I be the one
who had to go without?

23:12.042 --> 23:13.696
Maggie...

23:13.740 --> 23:16.656
you were always the one...

23:16.699 --> 23:19.093
who-who welcomed me, and...

23:19.136 --> 23:20.573
accepted me.

23:23.532 --> 23:27.406
But how much more
should you be expected to take?

23:30.583 --> 23:34.108
Sooner or later you'll realize
you're better off without me.

23:40.027 --> 23:42.595
I'm the problem
that needs to be fixed.

23:42.638 --> 23:44.292
Macy...Don't worry.

23:58.654 --> 24:00.221
May 19?

24:00.264 --> 24:02.266
She did it again.

24:02.310 --> 24:04.138
Except now the windows
are boarded up for some reason.

24:05.313 --> 24:06.880
I still have my memories.

24:06.923 --> 24:08.925
The potion's still working.
Come on, we got to go find her.

24:13.669 --> 24:16.672
Macy, this needs to stop.

24:19.632 --> 24:21.198
How do you know that name?

24:26.813 --> 24:29.903
That was years ago.
Before you girls, I had a baby.

24:29.946 --> 24:32.340
Her name was Macy,
but she was stillborn.MAGGIE: Right.

24:32.383 --> 24:33.776
We know.

24:33.820 --> 24:35.299
But you never-you never

24:35.343 --> 24:36.562
brought her back with Knansie?

24:36.605 --> 24:37.954
Who's that?

24:37.998 --> 24:39.565
Okay, Mom.

24:39.608 --> 24:43.090
This is going to sound,
uh, very weird.

24:43.133 --> 24:44.178
MAGGIE:
When we grew up--

24:44.221 --> 24:45.962
like, in our world--

24:46.006 --> 24:48.530
you brought Macy back
with a necromancer.

24:48.574 --> 24:50.314
In your world?

24:50.358 --> 24:52.316
Which-which is not this world?No, I know,

24:52.360 --> 24:54.536
it sounds crazy.

24:54.580 --> 24:57.670
But in that reality,
Mel and I and Macy

24:57.713 --> 24:59.367
became the
Charmed Ones.

25:01.674 --> 25:04.633
My daughters...
are the Charmed Ones?

25:04.677 --> 25:06.417
The three of us.
But...

25:06.461 --> 25:08.942
Macy took on the Source
to stop Alistair.

25:08.985 --> 25:11.118
But it's-it's too
much power for her.

25:11.161 --> 25:12.772
And-and she keeps spiraling.

25:12.815 --> 25:14.991
Creating new realities,
which is why we are here.

25:16.210 --> 25:18.081
In a version of the
world without Macy.

25:18.125 --> 25:20.867
I mean, she created a reality
that she doesn't exist in.

25:20.910 --> 25:21.955
Well, why would she do that?

25:21.998 --> 25:23.173
Maybe she decided to leave us

25:23.217 --> 25:24.653
before we could leave her.

25:25.698 --> 25:28.178
Arm yourselves.

25:28.222 --> 25:31.573
Look, Mel, she's
afraid of losing us.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.706
She's afraid she already has.We would never leave her.

25:33.749 --> 25:35.403
Yeah, but she doesn't
believe that.

25:35.446 --> 25:37.971
This is Macy.
She-she grew up alone.

25:38.014 --> 25:39.363
She feels like

25:39.407 --> 25:41.627
she loses everyone she loves.

25:41.670 --> 25:43.367
Our dad.

25:43.411 --> 25:45.326
Galvin.

25:45.369 --> 25:46.893
You.

25:46.936 --> 25:49.199
I understand
what that feels like.

25:51.462 --> 25:52.855
In another reality,

25:52.899 --> 25:55.771
I spent my whole life alone,
always feeling

25:55.815 --> 25:58.818
like something was missing,
like I'd been abandoned.

25:58.861 --> 25:59.993
Stand back.Mom, no!

26:02.996 --> 26:04.475
That's Harry.

26:04.519 --> 26:05.694
Our Whitelighter.

26:05.738 --> 26:07.566
Thank you, Melanie.

26:07.609 --> 26:11.004
Marisol, lovely to see you.

26:11.047 --> 26:13.528
We have a lot of work to do.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.574
And fast.

26:17.619 --> 26:18.881
And there's the rub.

26:18.925 --> 26:20.883
The language
is untranslatable.

26:20.927 --> 26:24.060
The spell was written
by an ancient Elder

26:24.104 --> 26:27.063
in a language only taught
to other Elders.

26:28.108 --> 26:29.805
MAGGIE:
Oh, wow.

26:29.849 --> 26:31.198
You'll need this.

26:31.241 --> 26:32.808
Macy's pendant.

26:32.852 --> 26:35.028
Show me a spell
to restore the balance.

26:36.638 --> 26:38.597
Somewhere, Macy must have felt

26:38.640 --> 26:40.729
that your sisterly connection
had been broken.

26:40.773 --> 26:42.601
And because she is the Source,

26:42.644 --> 26:44.733
her hurt caused
the Power of Three

26:44.777 --> 26:45.604
to rupture.

26:45.647 --> 26:46.517
If we can find that moment,

26:46.561 --> 26:47.867
there's a chance

26:47.910 --> 26:49.390
that we can fix everything.

26:49.433 --> 26:50.347
How?

26:50.391 --> 26:52.045
With this restoration spell.

26:52.088 --> 26:54.177
It'll take you back
to the exact moment

26:54.221 --> 26:55.788
the Power of Three split.

26:55.831 --> 26:58.529
It utilizes the magic
from your time bracelet.

26:58.573 --> 27:00.401
But once you get back
to that crucial moment,

27:00.444 --> 27:02.664
it is up to you
to make everything whole.

27:02.708 --> 27:03.883
Now go.

27:03.926 --> 27:06.059
Save your sister.

27:07.451 --> 27:09.584
Do it for me.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.586
But Mom...

27:11.630 --> 27:14.415
if you go back there,
you'll die all over again.

27:14.458 --> 27:15.895
I will.

27:15.938 --> 27:18.071
Because it's my destiny.

27:18.114 --> 27:20.116
It's what's meant to be.

27:29.560 --> 27:32.302
Niko is going to be fine.

27:34.522 --> 27:37.177
We're back. Mom.

27:37.220 --> 27:39.483
I just made it happen.MAGGIE:
Macy,

27:39.527 --> 27:40.920
we need to talk.Oh.

27:40.963 --> 27:43.009
And I wiped the memories
of everyone in town.

27:43.052 --> 27:45.098
According to them, none
of this ever happened.

27:45.141 --> 27:47.013
M-Maybe you should sit down

27:47.056 --> 27:48.754
so we can discuss
these new powers.

27:48.797 --> 27:50.103
No time, Harry.

27:50.146 --> 27:52.018
There is one more thing
I have to fix.

27:52.061 --> 27:54.585
Macy, stop!

27:55.674 --> 27:56.805
Excuse me?

27:56.849 --> 27:58.154
You have to listen to us.

27:58.198 --> 27:59.634
I don't have to do anything.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.288
Yes, you do.

28:01.331 --> 28:03.943
That power inside of you is more
than any one person can handle,

28:03.986 --> 28:05.814
which is why Mom
wants you to have this.

28:05.858 --> 28:07.729
She wants us to use it
to help you

28:07.773 --> 28:09.992
remove the Source.

28:12.429 --> 28:14.301
Mom's not here!Aah!

28:22.004 --> 28:23.397
Mel!Are you all right?

28:23.440 --> 28:24.485
I don't want to hurt you.

28:24.528 --> 28:27.227
MAGGIE:
Macy, this isn't you.

28:27.270 --> 28:29.185
This is all that power
polluting your brain.

28:29.229 --> 28:31.013
No! You're wrong.

28:31.057 --> 28:32.667
I am in complete control.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.843
If you're so in control,
why did you hurt your sister?

28:39.195 --> 28:41.763
You're trying
to take away my power!

28:41.807 --> 28:45.593
Macy, we know
that you're hurting.

28:45.636 --> 28:47.943
But we are not going anywhere.

28:47.987 --> 28:49.292
No matter what.

28:49.336 --> 28:51.294
Oh, you will.

28:51.338 --> 28:53.296
Everybody does, eventually.

28:54.820 --> 28:57.300
Oh. Oh, you're scared of me.

28:57.344 --> 28:58.780
I'm scared of me.

28:58.824 --> 29:00.216
Why wouldn't you leave?

29:00.260 --> 29:02.436
Because we're
your sisters.

29:02.479 --> 29:04.307
And we love you.

29:05.352 --> 29:07.920
I don't believe you.

29:07.963 --> 29:09.878
So just back off.

29:11.837 --> 29:13.273
MAGGIE:
New York.

29:13.316 --> 29:15.797
Are you kidding me?Son of a bitch.

29:15.841 --> 29:18.669
She did it again.Please do not tell
me she sent us

29:18.713 --> 29:20.149
to another reality.HARRY: No,

29:20.193 --> 29:21.716
she's just relocated us.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.153
Probably to keep herself from
inflicting any more pain.

29:24.197 --> 29:26.808
It's like she's trying
to protect us, in a way.Okay, well,

29:26.852 --> 29:29.332
how are we supposed to get to
her if she keeps relocating us?

29:29.376 --> 29:31.204
And, I mean, even
if we can find her,

29:31.247 --> 29:32.683
what if Mom's spell
doesn't work?

29:32.727 --> 29:34.294
It'll work.

29:34.337 --> 29:35.904
Okay, but what if it doesn't?

29:38.167 --> 29:41.518
I mean, now that we know
what Macy's capable of...

29:42.693 --> 29:44.695
What if we have to v...?

29:44.739 --> 29:46.175
Don't even say it.

29:46.219 --> 29:48.830
We just need to prove to her
that she's not alone.

29:48.874 --> 29:50.005
Well, given Macy's history--

29:50.049 --> 29:51.572
the pain that's
driving all of this--

29:51.615 --> 29:53.356
I'm certain she'll go back
to where it all started.

29:53.400 --> 29:56.185
The place where she was
brought back from the dead.

29:56.229 --> 29:57.360
Where your mother died.

29:58.274 --> 29:59.972
The attic.The attic.

30:00.015 --> 30:01.843
No, no. No.

30:01.887 --> 30:02.844
Don't understand me.

30:02.888 --> 30:04.498
They don't understand me.

30:05.586 --> 30:07.893
I don't want to hurt you.

30:09.938 --> 30:12.071
I told you...

30:12.114 --> 30:14.116
to back off!

30:29.784 --> 30:31.873
I don't want to hurt you.

30:31.917 --> 30:33.527
Macy, please, listen to us.

30:33.570 --> 30:34.876
We love you.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.182
Aah!

30:36.225 --> 30:38.358
Just... just leave me.

30:38.401 --> 30:40.229
It'll be so much easier.

30:40.273 --> 30:42.231
No.

30:42.275 --> 30:43.798
Macy, stop!

30:43.842 --> 30:45.060
I can't.

30:46.105 --> 30:47.889
It's too strong!

31:08.954 --> 31:11.043
Mel, grab my hand.

31:11.086 --> 31:12.348
I can orb us out.

31:12.392 --> 31:15.351
No! We're not leaving her!

31:15.395 --> 31:17.788
MAGGIE:
That's right.

31:17.832 --> 31:19.138
We're with you until the end.

31:19.181 --> 31:20.313
We're your sisters.

31:20.356 --> 31:21.967
We're not going anywhere.

31:23.011 --> 31:25.013
You're not?

31:28.060 --> 31:30.018
Oh, no matter what?

31:30.062 --> 31:31.019
No matter what.

31:31.063 --> 31:32.499
No matter what.

31:59.700 --> 32:01.876
I'm so sorry.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.183
For everything.

32:04.226 --> 32:07.099
You have nothing
to apologize for.

32:07.142 --> 32:10.145
It's time to let it all go.

32:10.189 --> 32:11.842
All the hurt.

32:13.670 --> 32:15.934
We're with you.

32:19.633 --> 32:20.851
Always.

32:23.376 --> 32:25.465
Come on.

32:40.697 --> 32:42.395
I need to move on.

32:44.527 --> 32:46.529
Without all this power.

33:04.678 --> 33:07.637
You know what this means
for Galvin, right?

33:07.681 --> 33:09.552
He'll die again.

33:09.596 --> 33:12.555
It was his choice.I know,

33:12.599 --> 33:14.557
but it hurts.

33:14.601 --> 33:15.863
âª Is strapped down...

33:18.257 --> 33:21.216
I, the Sister of Time,
call upon

33:21.260 --> 33:25.090
the Goddess Mamitu
to remove this power.

33:25.133 --> 33:27.744
I, the Sister of Emotion,

33:27.788 --> 33:30.225
call upon the Goddess Innana

33:30.269 --> 33:32.271
to remove this power.

33:34.621 --> 33:37.058
I, the Sister of Space,

33:37.102 --> 33:40.496
call upon the God Anu
to remove this power.

33:40.540 --> 33:44.065
âª And take me somewhere far...

33:44.109 --> 33:46.676
ALL:
Remove this power.

33:46.720 --> 33:50.550
Remove this power.
Remove this power.

33:53.988 --> 33:57.035
âª And recognize...

34:02.127 --> 34:05.130
âª Let's take a leap
in the dark âª

34:05.173 --> 34:07.610
âª A leap in the dark

34:07.654 --> 34:10.613
âª Let's take a leap
in the dark âª

34:23.800 --> 34:27.674
âª Silence louder than bombs

34:27.717 --> 34:29.893
âª The girl...

34:29.937 --> 34:32.940
Is the Source really in there?

34:33.941 --> 34:35.203
I think so.

34:36.248 --> 34:37.945
What do we do with them?

34:39.338 --> 34:41.688
We hide them.

34:41.731 --> 34:44.430
Separately.
In three

34:44.473 --> 34:46.258
different corners
of the world.

34:46.301 --> 34:48.347
And then Harry
wipes our memories.

34:54.266 --> 34:56.920
No one should ever
have that much power.

34:56.964 --> 34:59.053
Let's get to it, then.

35:08.715 --> 35:10.151
What do you think Mom would say

35:10.195 --> 35:12.632
if she saw us standing
together right now?

35:12.675 --> 35:15.983
MEL and MAGGIE:
Your differences
are your strengths,

35:16.026 --> 35:18.159
and nothing's as strong
as your sisterhood.

35:21.380 --> 35:22.772
Well, I hope she would say

35:22.816 --> 35:25.079
that she's proud of us.

35:25.123 --> 35:28.038
Not just for vanquishing demons
and saving the world,

35:28.082 --> 35:31.694
but... for saving our family.

35:31.738 --> 35:35.220
'Cause that's the thing
she chose to die for.

35:35.263 --> 35:36.438
More than once.

35:36.482 --> 35:38.397
âª I want to hold the hand

35:38.440 --> 35:39.876
âª Inside you...

35:39.920 --> 35:41.574
You know...

35:41.617 --> 35:43.967
for 29 years I have been
trying to convince myself

35:44.011 --> 35:46.405
that it would just be better
for everyone

35:46.448 --> 35:49.277
if I was alone.

35:49.321 --> 35:51.323
That I didn't need a family.

35:54.587 --> 35:57.459
But I know now that I was
really, really wrong.

35:59.766 --> 36:02.769
And I know that you will
always be there for me,

36:02.812 --> 36:06.076
and I will always be there
for you, because we're sisters.

36:06.120 --> 36:07.600
Oh, Maggie.

36:07.643 --> 36:09.689
Why are you crying?

36:09.732 --> 36:11.125
I'm not crying,
you're crying.

36:11.169 --> 36:14.824
Oh, Maggie.

36:14.868 --> 36:17.044
I just find it hard
to talk about my feelings,

36:17.087 --> 36:19.481
so I'm trying.

36:19.525 --> 36:21.744
Why are you laughing?

36:21.788 --> 36:25.226
Because she's your sister, Macy,
and that's what sisters do.

36:25.270 --> 36:28.098
Okay.Come on, let's go.

36:30.144 --> 36:32.842
You know what I was
just thinking?

36:32.886 --> 36:35.367
That you should
go see Parker?

36:35.410 --> 36:37.238
How'd you know that?

36:37.282 --> 36:39.284
Because you're always
thinking about him.

36:39.327 --> 36:41.547
Oh.

36:41.590 --> 36:43.070
I'm thinking he and I

36:43.113 --> 36:46.465
can just be a normal,
boring couple now.

36:46.508 --> 36:49.032
So he has demon in him.

36:49.076 --> 36:50.730
I can handle it.

36:50.773 --> 36:54.081
I mean, we defeated
Source Flame Macy.

36:54.124 --> 36:57.389
Go, have fun.See you.

36:59.304 --> 37:01.219
How about you?

37:01.262 --> 37:03.525
You ready to give things
a go with Niko?

37:05.788 --> 37:07.529
We saw what you did

37:07.573 --> 37:10.271
when you tried to mess with
the cosmic balance.

37:10.315 --> 37:12.969
Taking away people's choices.

37:13.013 --> 37:15.842
What I did to Niko
is just as bad.

37:15.885 --> 37:18.627
I owe it to her to let her go.

37:18.671 --> 37:20.586
I'm sorry, Mel.

37:20.629 --> 37:22.936
Mm.
At least I have you guys.

37:22.979 --> 37:24.154
MACY:
Yeah.

37:24.198 --> 37:26.200
Um, see you at home.

37:29.334 --> 37:31.292
Why are you looking at me
like that?

37:31.336 --> 37:33.512
I'm not.

37:37.733 --> 37:40.301
I would just like to point out
it's a gross violation of trust

37:40.345 --> 37:42.347
to read your Whitelighter's
private thoughts.

37:44.740 --> 37:46.742
Do you-do you want to talk
about what I heard?

37:49.049 --> 37:51.138
Let's just pretend
it never happened.

37:51.181 --> 37:54.750
âª On the eve of your departure

37:57.405 --> 38:00.756
âª I sat beside you
on the kitchen floor âª

38:08.416 --> 38:11.071
âª I don't want your voice
to move me âª

38:11.114 --> 38:14.988
âª I don't want to be
cracked open âª

38:15.031 --> 38:17.469
âª I don't want

38:17.512 --> 38:19.601
âª The broken headlight flicker

38:19.645 --> 38:23.126
âª The bright pines to move me.

38:30.133 --> 38:32.832
After everything
we've been through...

38:34.442 --> 38:36.662
Parker, you can't leave.

38:36.705 --> 38:39.621
There has to be a way
for us to be together.

38:39.665 --> 38:41.623
What if you come with me?

38:41.667 --> 38:43.843
Let's both get out
of this stupid town.

38:45.323 --> 38:48.108
My mom gave everything

38:48.151 --> 38:50.153
to make sure my sisters
and I were together.

38:51.546 --> 38:52.765
I can't.

38:52.808 --> 38:55.594
I understand.

38:55.637 --> 38:57.770
Just promise me
you'll come back,

38:57.813 --> 39:00.990
as soon as you have
your demon side in check.

39:02.252 --> 39:03.950
Please.

39:03.993 --> 39:06.256
Promise me you'll come back.

39:09.738 --> 39:11.523
I promise.

39:17.572 --> 39:20.575
MAGGIE: I will always love you.

39:34.981 --> 39:37.200
See you around, Vera.

39:49.299 --> 39:51.867
That was quite
a send-off.

39:51.911 --> 39:54.653
Seems like half
the campus was there.

39:54.696 --> 39:57.525
Yeah, and none of them know that
Galvin gave his life for them.

39:57.569 --> 39:59.527
He was a great guy.

39:59.571 --> 40:01.181
The greatest.

40:01.224 --> 40:03.792
And I will miss him, but...

40:03.836 --> 40:05.272
it was his choice.

40:05.315 --> 40:06.621
I have to respect that.

40:09.015 --> 40:10.799
Chloe?

40:13.106 --> 40:15.151
Okay, please don't "at" me,
but I totally

40:15.195 --> 40:17.284
broke into your house
while you were gone.

40:17.327 --> 40:19.286
You did?Hey, guys! They're back!

40:22.376 --> 40:23.377
Charmed Ones!

40:23.421 --> 40:24.596
Goat man!

40:24.639 --> 40:27.163
Technically,
the preferred term is satyr, but

40:27.207 --> 40:29.122
seeing as we're old friends...

40:29.165 --> 40:30.906
Is there a reason
you guys are in our house?

40:30.950 --> 40:31.994
We heard what you did--

40:32.038 --> 40:33.822
defeating Alistair Caine
by taking on

40:33.866 --> 40:35.955
the power of the Source.

40:35.998 --> 40:38.087
All of us owe you
a great debt of gratitude.WOMAN: Hear, hear.

40:39.741 --> 40:42.135
Well, we were just
doing our jobs.

40:42.178 --> 40:44.920
They are
the Charmed Ones, after all.

40:44.964 --> 40:46.139
WOMAN:
They certainly are.

40:46.182 --> 40:49.055
That's kind of
why we're here.

40:49.098 --> 40:52.580
Now that the Elders are gone,
who's in charge?

40:53.886 --> 40:55.278
There are decisions
to be made.

40:55.322 --> 40:56.628
Issues of jurisdiction,

40:56.671 --> 40:58.020
threats
to our various communities.

40:58.064 --> 40:59.718
Given what just went down,

40:59.761 --> 41:03.025
you're the natural choice
to take over.

41:04.462 --> 41:07.856
So this is our life now,
isn't it?

41:08.988 --> 41:10.816
I guess so.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.515
Guys, we can handle this.

41:15.777 --> 41:19.085
You didn't happen
to bring...

41:19.128 --> 41:20.478
âª All around the nation...

41:22.349 --> 41:25.352
We have business
to take care of.

41:25.395 --> 41:26.527
Come on.

41:26.571 --> 41:27.572
After you.

41:27.615 --> 41:29.574
Hi, you.

41:33.360 --> 41:35.754
Come on!

41:35.797 --> 41:38.452
âª We got a vision

41:38.496 --> 41:41.368
âª Coming in clear

41:41.411 --> 41:43.762
âª We see the future

41:43.805 --> 41:47.026
âª Starting right here,
ah, oh-oh-oh âª

41:47.069 --> 41:49.463
âª Oh, oh

41:49.507 --> 41:52.335
âª You can't touch us

41:52.379 --> 41:54.686
âª Come on, come onâªâª Rise up

41:54.729 --> 41:56.339
âª Come on, come onâª

41:56.383 --> 41:58.341
âª Stand up âª Come on, come on...âª
