WEBVTT

00:26.607 --> 00:30.987
Two households,
both alike in dignity,

00:31.112 --> 00:37.493
in fair Verona
where we lay our scene,

00:37.618 --> 00:42.498
from ancient grudge
break to new mutiny,

00:42.582 --> 00:48.004
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

00:48.087 --> 00:52.300
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...

00:54.093 --> 01:00.016
a pair of star-crossed lovers
take their life,

01:00.099 --> 01:05.480
whose misadventured
piteous overthrows

01:05.480 --> 01:11.486
do with their death...
bury their parents'strife.

01:24.916 --> 01:26.501
(laughing)

01:31.589 --> 01:34.509
But the quarrel is between
our masters and us their men.

01:34.592 --> 01:36.803
Ah, 'tis all one.

01:36.803 --> 01:38.513
(laughing)

01:38.596 --> 01:41.808
Here come the house
of the Montagues.

01:44.602 --> 01:46.020
Ah, good morrow.

01:46.104 --> 01:47.897
Good morrow
to you, sir.

01:47.897 --> 01:50.983
Quarrel,
I will back thee.

01:51.109 --> 01:52.485
Right.

01:52.610 --> 01:54.195
Fail me not.

02:04.205 --> 02:07.500
Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?

02:07.500 --> 02:10.502
I do bite
my thumb, sir.

02:10.502 --> 02:15.508
Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?

02:15.508 --> 02:18.011
No, sir.

02:18.011 --> 02:21.014
I do not bite my
thumb at you, sir,

02:21.014 --> 02:23.516
but I do bite
my thumb, sir.

02:23.516 --> 02:25.018
Do you quarrel, sir?

02:25.018 --> 02:30.481
Quarrel, sir?
No, no, no, sir.

02:30.606 --> 02:32.984
If you do, sir,
I am for you.

02:33.109 --> 02:34.986
I serve as good
a man as you.

02:35.111 --> 02:35.987
No better?

02:36.112 --> 02:38.281
Yes, better, sir.

02:41.617 --> 02:44.495
You lie.

02:52.503 --> 02:54.005
(laughing)

02:57.008 --> 02:58.509
Draw!

02:58.593 --> 03:00.219
Draw if you be men!

03:00.303 --> 03:02.096
Gregory, remember
thy swashing blow!

03:02.180 --> 03:03.890
(shouting)

03:06.517 --> 03:08.519
Kill the Capulets!

03:08.603 --> 03:10.480
(shouting)

03:23.993 --> 03:26.496
Part, fools!
Put up your swords!

03:26.496 --> 03:28.498
You know not what you do!

03:28.498 --> 03:30.500
The Prince hath
expressly forbid

03:30.500 --> 03:32.585
this bandying
in Verona streets!

03:32.585 --> 03:34.504
Here come the Capulets!

03:36.589 --> 03:40.009
Tybalt, Capulet's kinsman!

03:47.100 --> 03:52.397
What, art thou drawn among
these heartless hinds?

03:55.108 --> 03:57.985
Turn thee, Benvolio.
Look upon thy death.

03:58.111 --> 03:59.487
I do but keep the peace.

03:59.612 --> 04:00.988
Put up thy sword

04:01.114 --> 04:03.408
or manage it
to part these men with me.

04:03.491 --> 04:06.202
What, drawn
and talk of peace?

04:06.285 --> 04:07.704
I hate the word,

04:07.787 --> 04:12.208
as I hate hell,
all Montagues and thee.

04:12.291 --> 04:13.793
Have at thee, cowards!

04:13.918 --> 04:15.586
Capulet!

04:15.712 --> 04:17.005
Montague!

04:17.005 --> 04:19.298
(shouting)

04:19.382 --> 04:21.509
Capulet!

04:30.309 --> 04:32.186
Now hie thee home,
fragment.

04:32.311 --> 04:34.605
You villain!

04:38.401 --> 04:39.986
Capulet!

04:39.986 --> 04:41.988
(shouting)

04:45.283 --> 04:48.619
Give me my long sword! Ho!

04:48.703 --> 04:49.996
Capulet!

04:50.079 --> 04:51.497
Down to the market square!

04:51.581 --> 04:53.499
Capulet!

04:53.583 --> 04:56.294
Follow me! Follow me!

04:56.294 --> 05:00.006
Kill that villain Montague!

05:02.508 --> 05:05.386
My noble uncle!
My noble uncle!

05:05.511 --> 05:07.180
What?

05:07.305 --> 05:10.391
My sword! My sword!

05:10.516 --> 05:14.395
Thou shalt not stir
a foot to seek a foe!

05:14.520 --> 05:18.399
Hold me not!
Let me go!

05:18.399 --> 05:20.401
Montague!

05:20.485 --> 05:21.986
Montague!

05:21.986 --> 05:23.488
Kill the villain!

05:31.704 --> 05:33.498
(shouting)

05:43.383 --> 05:45.385
(woman screams)

05:48.304 --> 05:51.307
I'll strike thee, coward.

06:02.985 --> 06:04.404
(trumpet fanfare)

06:06.489 --> 06:08.116
The Prince!

06:08.199 --> 06:10.410
The Prince is coming!
Put down your weapons!

06:10.493 --> 06:12.704
The Prince!

06:12.787 --> 06:14.914
The Prince!

06:17.417 --> 06:19.585
Here comes the Prince!

06:19.585 --> 06:21.796
Put your weapons down!
The Prince!

06:29.012 --> 06:32.890
Rebellious subjects,
enemies to peace,

06:33.016 --> 06:35.518
throw your mistempered
weapons to the ground...

06:35.518 --> 06:37.311
Down with your weapons.

06:38.813 --> 06:42.817
And hear the sentence
of your moved Prince.

06:46.988 --> 06:51.492
Three civil brawls
bred of an airy word,

06:51.492 --> 06:52.994
by thee, old Capulet...

06:53.119 --> 06:54.704
No, no.

06:58.291 --> 07:00.585
And Montague...

07:00.710 --> 07:03.880
Have thrice disturbed
the quiet of our streets.

07:07.008 --> 07:10.386
If ever you disturb
our streets again,

07:10.511 --> 07:14.390
your lives shall pay
the forfeit of the peace.

07:14.515 --> 07:19.896
For this time
all the rest depart away!

07:22.482 --> 07:25.985
You, Capulet,
shall go along with me.

07:26.110 --> 07:28.488
And, Montague,
come you this afternoon.

07:31.491 --> 07:38.915
Once more, on pain of death,
all men depart.

07:38.998 --> 07:40.416
(trumpet fanfare)

07:55.515 --> 07:58.518
Where is Romeo?
Saw you him today?

07:58.518 --> 08:01.979
Right glad I am
he was not at this fray.

08:02.105 --> 08:04.399
Madam, an hour before
the worshipped sun

08:04.482 --> 08:06.984
peered forth
the golden window of the east,

08:07.110 --> 08:10.405
a troubled mind drove me
to walk abroad:

08:10.488 --> 08:12.907
where, underneath
the grove of sycamore

08:12.990 --> 08:15.118
so early walking
did I see your son.

08:15.201 --> 08:19.914
Towards him I made;
but he was ware of me,

08:19.998 --> 08:21.916
and stole into
the cover of the wood.

08:26.004 --> 08:29.882
Many a morning hath
he there been seen.

08:34.804 --> 08:36.889
See, where he comes.

08:44.689 --> 08:46.983
So please you, step aside.

08:46.983 --> 08:50.486
I'll know his grievance,
or be much denied.

08:50.486 --> 08:53.489
I would thou wert
so happy by thy stay,

08:53.489 --> 08:54.991
to hear true shrift.

08:54.991 --> 08:57.493
Come, madam. Let's away.

09:29.108 --> 09:31.402
Good morrow, cousin.

09:36.491 --> 09:38.284
Is the day so young?

09:38.284 --> 09:40.119
But new struck nine.

09:40.119 --> 09:41.412
Ay me!

09:43.498 --> 09:44.999
Sad hours seem long.

09:51.005 --> 09:53.508
Was that my father
that went hence so fast?

09:53.508 --> 09:55.009
Hmm?

09:55.009 --> 09:56.511
It was.

10:03.893 --> 10:06.604
What sadness lengthens
Romeo's hours?

10:06.688 --> 10:13.611
Not having that, which having
makes them short.

10:13.695 --> 10:16.781
Hmm. Hmm!

10:16.906 --> 10:18.491
But, Romeo...

10:18.616 --> 10:20.618
Farewell, Coz.

10:23.579 --> 10:25.498
(shouting)

10:27.500 --> 10:29.002
(woman screaming)

10:32.088 --> 10:34.007
God's me,
what fray was here?

10:34.090 --> 10:35.508
Yet tell me not,

10:35.591 --> 10:38.511
for I have heard it all.

10:40.096 --> 10:46.019
Here's much to do with hate,
but more with love.

10:46.102 --> 10:49.814
Soft, I will go along.

10:54.986 --> 10:58.489
But Montague is bound
as well as l,

10:58.614 --> 11:01.492
in penalty alike,

11:01.617 --> 11:03.494
and 'tis not hard, I think,

11:03.494 --> 11:06.998
for men as old as we
to keep the peace.

11:06.998 --> 11:07.999
Oh...

11:07.999 --> 11:10.501
Of honorable reckoning
are you both,

11:10.501 --> 11:14.005
and pity 'tis you
lived at odds so long:

11:14.005 --> 11:18.009
but, but now, my lord,

11:18.009 --> 11:20.011
what say you to my suit?

11:20.094 --> 11:23.014
But saying o'er what
I have said before,

11:23.097 --> 11:27.185
my child is yet
a stranger in the world.

11:27.310 --> 11:31.981
She hath not seen the change
of fourteen years.

11:33.483 --> 11:36.319
(laughing)

11:36.402 --> 11:39.489
Let two more summers
wither in their pride,

11:39.614 --> 11:41.407
'ere we may think her
ripe to be a bride.

11:41.491 --> 11:44.202
Younger than she
are happy mothers made.

11:44.202 --> 11:45.995
(chuckling)

11:52.293 --> 11:56.005
And too soon marred
are those so early made.

11:56.089 --> 11:59.008
The earth hath swallowed
all my hopes but she,

11:59.092 --> 12:02.011
she is the hopeful lady
of my earth.

12:02.095 --> 12:05.515
But woo her, gentle
Paris, get her heart,

12:05.515 --> 12:09.018
my will to her consent
is but a part.

12:09.018 --> 12:11.521
Oh, Peter!

12:11.521 --> 12:14.982
This night I hold
an old accustomed feast

12:14.982 --> 12:17.485
whereto I have invited
many a guest.

12:17.485 --> 12:20.488
Such as I love,
you among the store,

12:20.488 --> 12:23.491
one more, most welcome,
makes my number more.

12:31.582 --> 12:33.292
Nurse,
where's my daughter?

12:33.418 --> 12:35.503
Call her forth to me.

12:35.586 --> 12:37.505
Now, by my maidenhead
at 12 years old,

12:37.588 --> 12:39.007
I bade her come.

12:39.090 --> 12:42.510
Where is the girl?
Juliet! Juliet!

12:42.510 --> 12:46.681
Where is the girl?
Juliet!

12:46.806 --> 12:51.019
Where is the girl? Juliet!

12:51.102 --> 12:53.479
How now, who calls?

12:53.604 --> 12:55.606
Your mother!
Your lady mother!

13:07.493 --> 13:10.496
Juliet, it's your mother,
your lady mother.

13:10.496 --> 13:12.498
Make haste, girl.
Make haste.

13:12.498 --> 13:14.292
Where were you?

13:16.502 --> 13:20.506
Madam, I am here.
What is your will?

13:20.506 --> 13:23.009
This is the matter.

13:25.011 --> 13:27.513
Make haste, girls.
Come on, come on.

13:27.513 --> 13:28.598
Nurse, um...

13:28.598 --> 13:31.392
give leave awhile,
we must talk in secret.

13:39.108 --> 13:41.986
Nurse, come back again.
I have remembered me.

13:42.111 --> 13:45.490
Thou's hear our counsel.

13:45.615 --> 13:47.492
Thou knowest my daughter's
of a pretty age.

13:47.617 --> 13:49.494
I can tell her age
unto an hour.

13:49.619 --> 13:50.912
She's not fourteen.

13:51.120 --> 13:52.914
I'll lay fourteen
of my teeth.

13:52.997 --> 13:54.916
And yet to
my teen be it spoke,

13:54.999 --> 13:56.918
I have but four,
she's not fourteen.

13:57.001 --> 13:58.586
How long is it
to Lammastide?

13:58.711 --> 14:00.380
A fortnight and odd days.

14:00.505 --> 14:02.799
Even or odd, of all
the days of the year,

14:02.882 --> 14:04.801
come Lammas Eve at night
shall she be fourteen.

14:04.884 --> 14:06.302
Susan and she--

14:06.386 --> 14:08.805
God rest all Christian
souls were of an age.

14:08.888 --> 14:11.307
Well, Susan is with God.
She was too good for me.

14:11.391 --> 14:13.184
But, as I said,
on Lammas Eve

14:13.309 --> 14:15.395
at night
shall she be fourteen.

14:15.395 --> 14:17.605
That shall she, marry!
I remember it well.

14:17.689 --> 14:21.317
My lord and you
were then at Mantua!

14:21.401 --> 14:23.903
Nay, I do bear a brain.

14:23.903 --> 14:26.406
For then she could,
she could stand high lone.

14:26.406 --> 14:29.409
Nay, by the road she could have
run and waddled all about,

14:29.409 --> 14:32.412
for even the day before
she broke her brow;

14:32.412 --> 14:36.290
and then my husband-- God rest his soul,
'a were a merry man--

14:36.416 --> 14:37.792
took up the child.

14:37.917 --> 14:41.421
"Yea," quoth he,
"dost thou fall upon thy face?

14:41.421 --> 14:44.298
"Thou wilt fall backward
when thou hast more wit;

14:44.382 --> 14:45.383
wilt thou not, Jule?"

14:45.383 --> 14:47.385
Nurse!

14:47.385 --> 14:48.886
And by my holiday,

14:48.886 --> 14:51.389
the pretty wretch left
crying and said, "Ay."

14:51.389 --> 14:52.682
(laughing)

14:55.518 --> 14:58.396
Enough of this,
I pray thee hold thy peace.

14:58.479 --> 15:00.982
Yes, madam.

15:01.107 --> 15:04.694
Now, Juliet.

15:04.819 --> 15:06.320
(laughing)

15:06.404 --> 15:08.781
God mark thee to His grace

15:08.906 --> 15:12.285
Thou was the prettiest babe
that 'er I nurs'd.

15:12.285 --> 15:14.287
And I might live to see
thee married once,

15:14.412 --> 15:16.289
I have my wish.

15:16.289 --> 15:22.795
Marry, that "marry" is the very theme
I came to talk of.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.088
Tell me,
daughter Juliet,

15:24.213 --> 15:27.300
how stands your disposition
to be married?

15:34.891 --> 15:37.393
It is an honor
that I dream not of.

15:37.393 --> 15:39.896
An honor, were I not
thy only nurse,

15:39.896 --> 15:42.815
I would say thou hadst sucked
wisdom from my teat.

15:42.899 --> 15:45.401
Well, think
of marriage now.

15:45.401 --> 15:48.404
Younger than you, here in Verona,
ladies of esteem,

15:48.404 --> 15:49.906
are made
already mothers.

15:49.906 --> 15:52.408
By my count
I was your mother

15:52.408 --> 15:55.411
much upon these years
that you are now a maid.

15:55.411 --> 15:56.913
Oh, yes, I remember.

15:56.913 --> 15:59.707
Thus then, in brief...

15:59.791 --> 16:02.710
the valiant Paris
seeks you for his love.

16:02.710 --> 16:07.799
A man, young lady!
Lady, such as all the world--

16:07.882 --> 16:09.801
Why he's a man of wax.

16:09.884 --> 16:11.803
Verona's summer hath
not such a flower.

16:11.886 --> 16:13.805
Nay, he's
a flower in faith.

16:13.888 --> 16:15.306
Shh.

16:15.390 --> 16:20.311
What say you?
Can you love the gentleman?

16:21.896 --> 16:23.690
Madam! Madam!

16:23.690 --> 16:25.817
The guests have come,
supper serv'd up,

16:25.900 --> 16:27.985
you call'd,
my young lady ask'd for!

16:28.111 --> 16:30.279
We follow.

16:30.405 --> 16:34.409
Speak briefly,
can you like of Paris' love?

16:34.409 --> 16:39.914
I'll look to like,
if looking liking move.

16:39.914 --> 16:43.418
But no more deep
will I endart mine eye,

16:43.418 --> 16:46.421
than your consent gives
strength to make it fly.

16:49.882 --> 16:52.885
Juliet, the county stays.

16:52.885 --> 16:54.387
Madam, I come.

16:55.888 --> 17:00.893
Go, girl, seek happy nights
for happy days.

17:01.102 --> 17:02.311
(music playing)

17:10.694 --> 17:12.280
(singing)

17:23.082 --> 17:26.586
Give me a case
to put my visage in;

17:26.586 --> 17:28.588
a visor for a visor.

17:28.713 --> 17:33.301
What care I what curious eye
doth quote deformities.

17:33.384 --> 17:36.804
Here are the beetle-brows
shall blush for me.

17:36.888 --> 17:38.389
Ahh!

17:40.808 --> 17:42.810
What, shall this speech
be spoke for our excuse?

17:42.894 --> 17:44.896
Or shall we on
without apology?

17:44.896 --> 17:46.689
The date is out
of such prolixity.

17:46.814 --> 17:48.608
Let them measure us
by what they will.

17:48.691 --> 17:50.902
We'll measure them
a measure and be gone.

17:50.902 --> 17:53.905
Come, knock and enter,
and no sooner in,

17:53.905 --> 17:57.700
but every man
betake him to his legs.

17:57.784 --> 18:00.411
And we mean well in
going to this masque,

18:00.411 --> 18:01.788
but 'tis no wit to go.

18:01.913 --> 18:03.581
Why, may one ask?

18:03.706 --> 18:07.794
I dreamt a dream tonight.

18:07.794 --> 18:09.587
Ho, and so did I.

18:09.712 --> 18:13.216
Well, what was yours?

18:13.299 --> 18:16.594
That dreamers often lie.

18:16.719 --> 18:21.307
In bed asleep while they
do dream things true.

18:21.307 --> 18:24.894
Oh, then I see Queen Mab
hath been with you.

18:25.019 --> 18:27.605
Queen Mab?

18:27.689 --> 18:33.194
She is...She is
the fairies' midwife.

18:33.319 --> 18:34.821
(laughter)

18:34.904 --> 18:36.280
And she comes in state

18:36.280 --> 18:38.783
no bigger than
an agate stone

18:38.783 --> 18:40.785
on the forefinger
of an alderman,

18:40.910 --> 18:44.080
drawn with a team
of little atomies

18:44.205 --> 18:47.417
athwart men's noses
as they lie asleep.

18:47.500 --> 18:52.380
Her wagon spokes are made
of long spinner's legs;

18:52.380 --> 18:55.883
and the cover,
of the wings of grasshoppers;

18:55.883 --> 19:00.388
the traces
of the smallest spider's web;

19:00.388 --> 19:06.310
and the collars, mmm,
of the moonshine's watery beams;

19:06.394 --> 19:08.813
her whip, crack!

19:08.896 --> 19:12.900
Is a cricket's bone;
the lash of film;

19:12.984 --> 19:15.319
and in this state

19:15.319 --> 19:17.989
she gallops night by night
through lovers' brains,

19:18.114 --> 19:21.492
and then they dream of love,

19:21.617 --> 19:25.997
o'er ladies' lips,
who straight on kisses dream,

19:26.080 --> 19:31.502
which oft the angry Mab
with blisters plagues,

19:31.586 --> 19:34.505
because their breaths
with, er,

19:34.589 --> 19:36.007
sweetmeats tainted are.

19:36.090 --> 19:39.510
Snd sometime comes she
with a tithe-pig's tail,

19:39.594 --> 19:42.513
tickling the parson's nose
as he lies asleep,

19:42.597 --> 19:47.685
and dreams he
of another benefice.

19:47.685 --> 19:51.481
(all) Amen.

19:51.606 --> 19:53.107
(laughter)

19:53.191 --> 19:55.902
Sometimes she driveth
o'er a soldier's neck,

19:55.985 --> 19:57.403
and then dreams he

19:57.487 --> 20:00.907
of cutting foreign throats,
of breaches,

20:00.907 --> 20:04.118
ambuscadoes, spanish blades,
drums in his ear,

20:04.118 --> 20:05.620
at which he starts and wakes;

20:05.620 --> 20:09.082
and being thus frighted
tries a prayer or two...

20:14.087 --> 20:16.589
and sleeps again.

20:16.589 --> 20:18.591
This is that very Mab

20:18.591 --> 20:21.594
that plaits the manes
of horses in the night,

20:21.594 --> 20:25.598
and bakes the elf-locks
in foul sluttish hairs,

20:25.598 --> 20:29.185
which once untangled
much misfortune bodes.

20:29.310 --> 20:33.606
This is the hag,
when maids lie on their backs,

20:33.690 --> 20:37.110
that presses them
and learns them first to bear

20:37.193 --> 20:41.614
making them women
of good carriage.

20:41.698 --> 20:43.408
This is she...

20:43.491 --> 20:46.619
This is she that...

20:46.703 --> 20:50.415
This...is she.

20:57.714 --> 21:00.091
Peace, Mercutio, peace.

21:00.216 --> 21:02.593
Thou talk'st of nothing.

21:02.593 --> 21:07.098
Thou talk'st of nothing.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.310
True.

21:11.310 --> 21:15.606
True, I talk of dreams;

21:15.606 --> 21:19.610
which are the children
of an idle brain...

21:21.112 --> 21:25.616
Begot of nothing
but vain fantasy;

21:25.616 --> 21:30.079
which is as thin
of substance as the air,

21:30.079 --> 21:33.082
and more inconstant
than the wind

21:33.207 --> 21:36.586
who woos even now
the frozen bosom of the north,

21:36.711 --> 21:40.590
and being angered
puffs away from thence,

21:40.715 --> 21:43.593
turning his side
to the dew-dropping south.

21:48.014 --> 21:52.101
This wind you talk of
blows us from ourselves.

21:52.185 --> 21:56.105
Strike drum.
Come, lusty gentlemen.

21:56.189 --> 21:58.691
(music playing)

21:58.691 --> 22:00.109
(singing)

22:02.195 --> 22:04.489
Romeo, we shall
arrive too late.

22:06.616 --> 22:08.993
I fear too early...

22:10.620 --> 22:13.081
For my mind misgives...

22:13.081 --> 22:16.584
Some consequence,
yet hanging in the stars,

22:16.584 --> 22:21.589
shall bitterly begin
his fearful date

22:21.589 --> 22:24.092
with this night's revels,

22:24.092 --> 22:27.095
and expire the term
of a despised life

22:27.095 --> 22:30.098
closed in my breast,

22:30.098 --> 22:35.103
by some vile forfeit
of untimely death.

22:35.103 --> 22:36.604
(bell tolling)

22:40.191 --> 22:43.611
But he that hath
the steerage of my course...

22:45.697 --> 22:47.615
Direct my sail.

22:52.495 --> 22:56.582
Enter my poor house.
Vido, vido, welcome.

22:56.708 --> 23:01.587
Oh, my lovely Helena,
my lovely niece.

23:01.713 --> 23:04.507
Welcome all!
Be merry, gentlemen.

23:04.590 --> 23:07.510
Be lively, ladies.
Ahoy! Ahoy!

23:07.593 --> 23:09.012
Welcome, gentlemen.

23:09.095 --> 23:11.514
I have seen the day
that I have worn a visor

23:11.597 --> 23:14.017
and could tell a whispering tale
in a fair lady's ear,

23:14.100 --> 23:15.601
such as would please.

23:15.601 --> 23:18.604
'Tis gone, 'tis gone.
You are welcome, gentlemen.

23:18.604 --> 23:21.607
Ladies, ho, ho!

23:21.607 --> 23:23.109
(music playing)

26:01.517 --> 26:05.480
She doth teach the torches
to burn bright.

26:07.607 --> 26:10.318
It seems she hangs
upon the cheek of night

26:10.318 --> 26:13.488
as a rich jewel
in an Ethiop's ear;,

26:13.613 --> 26:19.118
beauty too rich for use,
for earth too dear.

26:21.120 --> 26:24.582
So shows a snowy dove
trooping with crows,

26:24.582 --> 26:29.212
as yonder lady
o'er her fellow shows.

26:34.092 --> 26:36.386
Did my heart love till now?

26:36.511 --> 26:40.014
Forswear it sight,

26:40.098 --> 26:44.394
for I ne'er saw true beauty
till this night.

26:53.111 --> 26:55.279
This by his voice
should be a Montague.

27:03.204 --> 27:07.000
Uncle, this is
a Montague, our foe;

27:07.083 --> 27:09.002
a villain that is
hither come in spite,

27:09.085 --> 27:11.004
to scorn at
our solemnity this night.

27:11.087 --> 27:12.588
Young Romeo is it?

27:12.714 --> 27:15.008
Dares the slave come hither
covered in an antic face,

27:15.091 --> 27:16.884
to fear and scorn
at our solemnity?

27:16.884 --> 27:19.012
'A bears him like
a courtly gentleman;

27:19.095 --> 27:21.014
and to say truth,
Verona brags of him

27:21.097 --> 27:23.016
to be a virtuous
and well managed youth.

27:23.099 --> 27:25.018
I would not for the wealth
of all this town

27:25.101 --> 27:27.020
here in my house
do him disparagement.

27:27.103 --> 27:29.397
Therefore have patience,
take no note of him.

27:29.480 --> 27:31.983
The Moureska!

27:32.108 --> 27:33.484
The Moureska!

27:33.609 --> 27:34.986
(jingling)

27:50.084 --> 27:51.502
(laughs)

27:53.087 --> 27:55.798
(music plays)

29:06.995 --> 29:09.998
Why, Uncle,
'tis a shame!

29:09.998 --> 29:11.499
Go to.

29:11.582 --> 29:14.002
You are a saucy boy.

29:14.002 --> 29:16.504
You'll make a mutiny
among my guests!

29:16.504 --> 29:19.007
Am I the master here,
or you?

29:19.007 --> 29:20.508
I will not endure him.

29:20.508 --> 29:22.719
You will not endure!
He shall be endured!

29:22.719 --> 29:24.220
Or I know what!

29:26.014 --> 29:29.017
Well said, my hearts.

29:37.483 --> 29:39.986
You're a princox.

29:39.986 --> 29:42.196
Be quiet or...

29:43.781 --> 29:45.199
Ah.

29:49.620 --> 29:51.998
For shame!
I'll make you quiet.

30:57.980 --> 31:01.609
Leonardo will sing!

31:01.609 --> 31:04.195
Leonardo, I pray thee, sing.

31:14.998 --> 31:18.793
What is a youth?

31:18.918 --> 31:22.588
Impetuous fire

31:22.714 --> 31:26.592
What is a maid?

31:26.718 --> 31:29.887
Ice and desire

31:30.013 --> 31:33.391
The world wags on

31:33.391 --> 31:37.895
A rose will bloom

31:37.895 --> 31:42.316
It then will fade

31:42.400 --> 31:46.779
So does a youth

31:46.904 --> 31:55.788
So does the fairest maid

31:55.913 --> 31:59.083
Comes the time

31:59.208 --> 32:00.585
When one sweet smile

32:00.710 --> 32:06.090
Has its season for a while

32:06.215 --> 32:12.013
Then love's in love with me

32:12.096 --> 32:15.892
Some may think only to marry

32:15.892 --> 32:19.520
Others will tease and tarry

32:19.604 --> 32:22.899
Mine is the very best parry

32:22.982 --> 32:26.694
Cupid he rules us all

32:26.694 --> 32:30.281
Caper the caper,
sing me the song

32:30.406 --> 32:33.785
Death will come soon
to hush us along

32:33.910 --> 32:37.288
Sweeter than honey
and bitter as gall

32:37.413 --> 32:41.000
Love is a pastime
that never will pall

32:41.000 --> 32:45.004
Sweeter than honey
and bitter as gall

32:45.088 --> 32:50.885
Cupid he rules us all

33:09.696 --> 33:14.492
A rose will bloom

33:14.617 --> 33:18.579
And then will fade

33:18.705 --> 33:25.503
So does a youth

33:25.586 --> 33:35.179
So does the fairest maid

33:36.806 --> 33:41.019
If I profane
with my unworthiest hand

33:41.102 --> 33:43.479
this holy shrine,

33:43.604 --> 33:46.691
the gentle sin is this;

33:46.691 --> 33:52.905
my lips, two blushing pilgrims,
ready stand

33:52.989 --> 33:59.787
to smooth the rough touch
with a gentle kiss.

33:59.912 --> 34:02.206
Oh.

34:16.596 --> 34:22.518
Good pilgrim, you do wrong
your hand too much

34:22.601 --> 34:26.481
which mannerly devotion
shows in this;

34:26.606 --> 34:30.985
for saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch

34:31.110 --> 34:35.989
and palm to palm is
holy palmers' kiss.

34:36.114 --> 34:39.994
Have not saints lips,
and holy palmers too?

34:40.119 --> 34:43.998
Ay, pilgrim, lips that
they must use in prayer.

34:44.081 --> 34:45.500
Oh...

34:45.583 --> 34:49.504
O then, dear saint,

34:49.587 --> 34:54.007
let lips do
what hands do...

34:59.097 --> 35:04.519
They pray,
grant thou,

35:04.519 --> 35:06.979
lest faith
turn to despair.

35:06.979 --> 35:08.981
Saints do not move,

35:08.981 --> 35:10.983
though grants
for prayers' sake.

35:10.983 --> 35:12.986
Then move not...

35:16.614 --> 35:19.993
While my prayer's
effect I take.

35:22.620 --> 35:29.502
Thus from my lips,
by thine,

35:29.585 --> 35:33.214
my sin is purged.

35:43.099 --> 35:47.020
Then have my lips the sin
that they have took.

35:47.103 --> 35:48.980
Sin from my lips!

35:49.105 --> 35:50.982
O trespass sweetly urged!

35:51.107 --> 35:53.985
Give me my sin again.

35:55.820 --> 36:00.491
A rose will bloom

36:00.616 --> 36:03.786
It then will fade

36:03.911 --> 36:09.917
So does a youth

36:10.001 --> 36:22.889
So does the fairest maid

36:31.689 --> 36:32.982
Juliet!

36:33.107 --> 36:35.693
Lady Juliet!

36:35.693 --> 36:37.403
Nurse?

36:37.487 --> 36:40.198
Your mother craves
a word with you.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.703
Make haste, make haste!

36:50.583 --> 36:52.001
What is her mother?

36:52.085 --> 36:53.503
Hmm.
Merry, bachelor,

36:53.586 --> 36:56.506
her mother is
the lady of the house,

36:56.589 --> 36:59.509
and a good lady,
and wise, and virtuous;

36:59.592 --> 37:02.011
I nursed her daughter
that you talked withal.

37:02.095 --> 37:03.096
Hmm.

37:09.018 --> 37:11.979
I tell you he that
shall lay hold of her

37:11.979 --> 37:14.482
shall have the chinks.

37:16.317 --> 37:19.988
Is she a Capulet?

37:21.406 --> 37:24.492
Ah, dear account!

37:24.492 --> 37:27.787
My life is my foe's debt.

37:32.792 --> 37:35.712
What, ho, my mistresses?

37:35.795 --> 37:37.505
What, will you be gone?

37:37.588 --> 37:40.008
It seems so, poor God,
it is so very late.

37:40.091 --> 37:42.301
We'll call it early,
by and by.

37:42.301 --> 37:44.595
Good night,
sweet, my Lady Juliet.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.019
Come hither, nurse.

37:51.102 --> 37:53.021
Hmm?

37:53.104 --> 37:54.605
What is yon gentleman?

37:54.689 --> 37:55.982
Count Paris.

37:56.107 --> 37:59.610
No. What's he
that follows there?

38:01.696 --> 38:03.406
Oh! I know not.

38:03.489 --> 38:05.491
Go, ask his name.

38:07.994 --> 38:10.997
Hmm. Romeo, of
the house of Montague.

38:10.997 --> 38:12.582
What?

38:12.707 --> 38:15.585
His name is Romeo,
and a Montague;

38:15.710 --> 38:18.296
the only son of
your great enemy.

38:25.011 --> 38:30.016
My only love sprung
from my only hate,

38:30.016 --> 38:34.979
too early seen unknown,
and known too late!

38:37.106 --> 38:38.483
Oh!

38:38.608 --> 38:41.486
Prodigious birth of love
it is to me

38:41.611 --> 38:44.405
that I must love
a loathed enemy.

38:54.082 --> 38:55.500
Juliet!

38:55.583 --> 38:58.002
My Lady Juliet!

38:58.086 --> 39:01.506
Madam!

39:01.589 --> 39:05.802
Romeo!

39:09.389 --> 39:10.598
Juliet!

39:12.016 --> 39:15.520
Romeo!

39:15.520 --> 39:18.106
Lady Juliet!

39:19.482 --> 39:20.983
Juliet!

39:20.983 --> 39:25.113
Romeo!

39:26.406 --> 39:27.991
(horn blows)

39:27.991 --> 39:30.493
Romeo!

39:30.493 --> 39:32.495
Romeo!

39:32.495 --> 39:34.497
(laughter)

39:34.497 --> 39:37.500
Romeo!

39:37.500 --> 39:40.003
Romeo!

39:40.003 --> 39:41.587
Romeo!

39:41.713 --> 39:44.007
Romeo!

39:44.090 --> 39:47.010
Romeo!

39:47.093 --> 39:50.513
1, 2, 3.

39:50.596 --> 39:56.019
- Romeo!
- Romeo!

39:56.102 --> 39:57.520
He is wise,

39:57.603 --> 40:00.690
and on my life hath
stolen him home to bed.

40:00.815 --> 40:01.983
He leaped
this orchard wall.

40:02.108 --> 40:03.192
Call, good Mercutio.

40:03.318 --> 40:04.485
Romeo!

40:04.610 --> 40:07.697
(whistles)

40:07.780 --> 40:09.699
Romeo! Passion! Lover!

40:09.782 --> 40:12.285
O-hooo! Madman!

40:12.285 --> 40:14.704
O-hooo! Romeo!

40:14.787 --> 40:18.791
He heareth not,
he stirreth not, he moveth not.

40:18.916 --> 40:20.418
The ape is dead.

40:20.418 --> 40:26.299
He jests at scars
that never felt a wound.

40:26.507 --> 40:29.010
Romeo, it's all right.

40:29.093 --> 40:30.720
(dog barking)

40:32.096 --> 40:33.890
But soft,

40:34.015 --> 40:38.102
what light through
yonder window breaks?

40:50.698 --> 40:52.200
(bell ringing)

41:04.504 --> 41:06.798
It is my lady,

41:06.798 --> 41:11.886
oh, it is my love.

41:11.886 --> 41:13.805
Oh...

41:13.888 --> 41:17.392
O that she knew she were.

41:17.392 --> 41:20.895
She speaks,
yet she says nothing.

41:20.895 --> 41:23.106
What of that?

41:24.899 --> 41:29.404
Her eye discourses,
I will answer it.

41:29.487 --> 41:32.407
I am too bold,

41:32.490 --> 41:35.410
'tis not to me she speaks.

41:35.493 --> 41:39.914
Two of the fairest stars
in all the heavens,

41:39.998 --> 41:43.418
having some business,
do entreat her eyes

41:43.501 --> 41:47.380
to twinkle in their spheres
till they return.

41:47.505 --> 41:50.508
See how she leans her cheek
upon her hand.

41:50.591 --> 41:54.012
Oh, that I were
a glove upon that hand,

41:54.095 --> 41:56.597
that I might touch
that cheek.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.184
Ay me!

42:00.309 --> 42:02.311
She speaks.

42:07.692 --> 42:11.112
Oh, speak again,
bright angel.

42:11.112 --> 42:15.908
O Romeo, Romeo,

42:15.908 --> 42:19.412
wherefore art thou, Romeo?

42:19.412 --> 42:24.500
Deny thy father,
and refuse thy name.

42:24.584 --> 42:28.504
Or if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love,

42:28.588 --> 42:30.882
and I'll no longer
be a Capulet.

42:30.882 --> 42:32.383
Shall I hear more,

42:32.383 --> 42:34.385
or shall I speak at this?

42:34.510 --> 42:36.387
'Tis but thy name
that is my enemy.

42:36.512 --> 42:40.183
Thou art thyself,
though not a Montague.

42:42.810 --> 42:44.520
What is Montague?

42:45.980 --> 42:51.486
It is nor hand nor foot,
nor arm nor face

42:51.611 --> 42:55.406
nor any other part
belonging to a man.

42:55.490 --> 42:58.618
O be some other name.

43:00.495 --> 43:02.580
What's in a name?

43:02.705 --> 43:05.083
That which we call a rose

43:05.208 --> 43:08.211
by any other name
would smell as sweet;

43:08.211 --> 43:11.798
so Romeo would,
were he not Romeo called,

43:11.881 --> 43:14.384
retain that dear perfection

43:14.384 --> 43:17.387
which he owes
without that title.

43:17.512 --> 43:20.890
Romeo, doff thy name,

43:20.890 --> 43:23.893
and for that name
which is no part of thee,

43:23.893 --> 43:26.020
take all myself.

43:28.815 --> 43:31.109
I'll take thee
at thy word.

43:31.109 --> 43:33.111
Call me but love,
and I'll be new baptized;

43:33.194 --> 43:36.406
henceforth I never
will be Romeo.

43:36.406 --> 43:39.909
What man art thou,
that thus bescreened in night

43:39.993 --> 43:41.619
so stumblest
on my counsel?

43:41.703 --> 43:45.498
By a name I know not how to
tell thee who I am.

43:45.581 --> 43:47.417
My name, dear saint,
is hateful to myself,

43:47.500 --> 43:48.793
because it is
an enemy to thee.

43:48.918 --> 43:51.713
Had I it written,
I would tear the word.

43:54.507 --> 43:56.884
My ears have not yet drunk

43:57.010 --> 43:59.887
a hundred words
of that tongue's utterance,

44:00.013 --> 44:01.889
yet I know the sound.

44:02.015 --> 44:05.018
Art thou not Romeo,
and a Montague?

44:05.101 --> 44:07.520
Neither, fair maid,
if either thee dislike.

44:07.603 --> 44:10.314
How cam'st thou hither,
tell me and wherefore?

44:10.398 --> 44:12.817
The orchard walls are
high and hard to climb,

44:12.900 --> 44:15.194
and the place death,
considering who thou art,

44:15.320 --> 44:17.780
if any of my kinsmen
find thee here.

44:17.905 --> 44:19.407
With love's light wings

44:19.407 --> 44:21.409
did I o'er perch
these walls,

44:21.409 --> 44:23.911
for stony limits
cannot hold love out,

44:23.911 --> 44:26.914
and what love can do,
that dares love attempt.

44:26.914 --> 44:28.708
Therefore thy kinsmen
are no stop to me.

44:28.708 --> 44:29.792
Sshhh!

44:31.919 --> 44:34.881
If they do see thee,
they will murder thee.

44:35.006 --> 44:39.385
I have night's cloak to
hide me from their eyes.

44:39.385 --> 44:42.388
And but thou love me...

44:44.307 --> 44:46.184
Let them find me here

44:46.309 --> 44:49.187
my life were better
ended by their hate,

44:49.312 --> 44:52.607
than death prorogued,
wanting of thy love.

44:55.485 --> 44:57.403
Dost thou love me?

44:57.403 --> 45:00.615
I know thou wilt say ay,
and I will take thy word;

45:00.698 --> 45:02.116
yet if thou swearest,

45:02.200 --> 45:03.493
thou mayst prove false;

45:03.618 --> 45:07.997
at lovers' perjuries
they say jove laughs.

45:08.081 --> 45:10.291
O gentle Romeo,

45:10.416 --> 45:15.505
if thou dost love,
pronounce it faithfully.

45:15.588 --> 45:18.299
Or if thou thinkest
I am too quickly won,

45:18.383 --> 45:21.886
I'll frown and be perverse,
and say thee nay,

45:22.011 --> 45:25.306
so thou wilt woo
but else not for the world.

45:25.390 --> 45:30.520
In truth, fair Montague,
I am too fond...

45:33.606 --> 45:35.984
And therefore thou mayst think
my haviour light.

45:36.109 --> 45:37.193
No.

45:37.318 --> 45:39.988
But trust me, gentleman,
I'll prove more true

45:40.113 --> 45:42.115
than those that have
more cunning to be strange.

45:45.118 --> 45:47.495
I should have been
more strange,

45:47.620 --> 45:48.997
I must confess,

45:49.080 --> 45:52.000
but that thou overheard'st,
ere I was ware,

45:52.083 --> 45:54.502
my true love's passion;

45:54.585 --> 45:58.506
therefore pardon me,

45:58.589 --> 46:01.509
and not impute this yielding
to light love,

46:01.592 --> 46:04.387
which the dark night
hath so discovered.

46:04.512 --> 46:08.016
Lady, by yonder
blessed moon, I swear.

46:08.099 --> 46:10.018
Oh, swear not by the moon,

46:10.018 --> 46:11.519
th'inconstant moon,

46:11.602 --> 46:15.982
that monthly changes
in her circled orb,

46:16.107 --> 46:20.111
lest that thy love prove
likewise variable.

46:20.194 --> 46:22.613
What shall I swear by?

46:22.613 --> 46:24.615
Do not swear at all.

46:24.615 --> 46:28.995
Or if thou wilt...

46:29.120 --> 46:30.997
Swear by thy gracious self,

46:31.080 --> 46:34.000
which is the god
of my idolatry,

46:34.083 --> 46:36.502
and I'll believe thee.

46:36.586 --> 46:41.591
If my heart's dear love,
I swear...

46:41.716 --> 46:43.509
Oh, Juliet!

46:59.609 --> 47:02.987
Sweet, good night.

47:03.112 --> 47:06.491
This bud of love
by summer's ripening breath

47:06.616 --> 47:10.495
may prove a beauteous flower
when next we meet.

47:17.085 --> 47:21.714
Good night, good night.

47:21.714 --> 47:25.218
As sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart

47:25.218 --> 47:28.221
as that
within my breast.

47:34.102 --> 47:36.604
O, wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied?

47:38.106 --> 47:41.401
What satisfaction
canst thou have tonight?

47:41.484 --> 47:45.279
Th' exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.

47:45.405 --> 47:46.990
Ahh.

47:56.582 --> 48:00.503
I gave thee mine before
thou didst request it.

48:00.586 --> 48:03.297
And yet I would it were
to give again.

48:06.009 --> 48:08.011
Wouldst thou
withdraw it?

48:08.094 --> 48:10.304
For what purpose, love?

48:10.388 --> 48:15.309
But to be frank
and give it thee again.

48:18.896 --> 48:24.986
And yet I wish
but for the thing I have,

48:25.111 --> 48:27.989
my bounty is
as boundless as the sea,

48:28.114 --> 48:29.490
my love as deep.

48:29.615 --> 48:32.493
The more I give to thee,
the more I have,

48:32.618 --> 48:34.495
for both are infinite.

48:34.620 --> 48:35.997
Juliet!

48:36.080 --> 48:37.498
Anon, good nurse!

48:37.582 --> 48:41.002
Sweet Montague, be true.

48:41.085 --> 48:43.504
Madam!

48:43.588 --> 48:46.507
Stay but a little,
I will come again.

48:46.591 --> 48:49.010
Madam! Lady Juliet!

48:57.101 --> 48:59.687
O blessed, blessed night!

49:01.397 --> 49:04.317
Oh! I am afeard,
being in night,

49:04.400 --> 49:06.486
all this is but a dream,

49:06.486 --> 49:08.988
too flattering-sweet
to be substantial.

49:08.988 --> 49:12.992
Three words, dear Romeo,
and good night indeed.

49:13.117 --> 49:15.995
If that thy bent of love
be honorable,

49:16.120 --> 49:18.498
thy purpose marriage,
send me word tomorrow,

49:18.581 --> 49:21.000
by one that I'll procure
to come to thee.

49:21.084 --> 49:24.003
Where and what time
thou wilt perform the rite,

49:24.087 --> 49:26.506
and all my fortunes
at thy foot I'll lay

49:26.589 --> 49:29.217
and follow thee, my lord,
throughout the world.

49:29.300 --> 49:30.510
Madam!

49:30.593 --> 49:33.596
I come, anon.

49:33.680 --> 49:37.016
But if thou meanest not well,
I do beseech thee--

49:37.100 --> 49:38.184
Lady Juliet!

49:38.184 --> 49:39.519
By and by I come!

49:39.602 --> 49:42.689
To cease thy suit
and leave me to my grief.

49:42.814 --> 49:44.190
Tomorrow will I send.

49:44.315 --> 49:46.901
So thrive my soul.

49:46.985 --> 49:49.612
A thousand times
good night!

49:53.408 --> 49:54.993
Romeo!

49:55.118 --> 49:57.787
At what o'clock tomorrow
shall I send to thee?

49:57.912 --> 49:58.997
At the hour of nine.

49:59.080 --> 50:00.999
I will not fail.

50:01.082 --> 50:03.292
'Tis twenty years
till then.

50:04.711 --> 50:05.586
Romeo!

50:14.095 --> 50:16.514
I have forgot
why I did call thee back.

50:17.890 --> 50:20.018
Let me stand here
till thou remember it.

50:20.101 --> 50:23.604
I shall forget, to have
thee still stand there,

50:23.604 --> 50:24.814
remembering how
I love thy company.

50:24.897 --> 50:26.316
And I'll still stay,

50:26.399 --> 50:28.318
to have thee
still forget,

50:28.401 --> 50:31.321
forgetting
any other home but this.

50:31.404 --> 50:33.614
Ahh.

50:50.506 --> 50:52.884
(rooster crowing)

50:58.514 --> 51:01.392
Good night, good night!

51:01.517 --> 51:04.979
Parting is
such sweet sorrow

51:05.104 --> 51:08.191
that I shall say good night
till it be morrow.

51:49.399 --> 51:51.109
Woo!

52:17.218 --> 52:18.511
Woo!

53:08.895 --> 53:11.689
Friar Laurence!

53:11.814 --> 53:14.484
What early tongue
so sweet saluteth me?

53:14.609 --> 53:16.486
Good morrow, father!

53:16.611 --> 53:18.488
Ha ha ha!

53:18.613 --> 53:20.990
Hey!

53:24.118 --> 53:26.788
Young son, it argues
a distempered head

53:26.913 --> 53:30.291
so soon to bid
good morrow to thy bed.

53:30.416 --> 53:32.418
Therefore thy earliness
doth me assure

53:32.502 --> 53:34.420
thou art uproused with
some distemperature.

53:34.504 --> 53:37.882
Or if not so,
then here I put it right

53:38.007 --> 53:40.385
our Romeo hath not
been in bed tonight.

53:40.510 --> 53:43.596
The last is true.
The sweeter rest was mine.

53:43.680 --> 53:45.890
God pardon sin!
Wast thou with Rosaline?

53:46.015 --> 53:48.393
With Rosaline,
my ghostly father, no.

53:48.518 --> 53:51.396
I have forgot that name
and that name's woe.

53:51.521 --> 53:52.897
That's my good son.

53:52.981 --> 53:54.899
Well, where hast
thou been then?

53:54.983 --> 53:57.402
I'll tell thee ere
thou ask it me again.

53:57.485 --> 53:59.904
I have been feasting
with mine enemy,

53:59.988 --> 54:02.281
where on a sudden
one hath wounded me.

54:02.407 --> 54:05.410
Be plain, good son,
and homely in thy drift.

54:05.410 --> 54:07.495
Riddling confession finds
but riddling shrift.

54:07.620 --> 54:11.416
Then plainly know
my heart's dear love is set,

54:11.416 --> 54:13.918
on the fair daughter
of rich Capulet.

54:13.918 --> 54:17.380
As mine on hers,
so hers is set on mine,

54:17.380 --> 54:19.882
and all combined,
save what thou must combine

54:19.882 --> 54:21.884
by holy marriage.

54:21.884 --> 54:23.886
When and where,
and how we met,

54:23.886 --> 54:26.389
we woo'd, and made
exchange of vow,

54:26.389 --> 54:27.807
I'll tell thee as we pass.

54:27.807 --> 54:29.392
But this I pray,

54:29.392 --> 54:31.686
that thou consent
to marry us today.

54:31.811 --> 54:33.896
Hmmm?

54:33.980 --> 54:36.107
Holy Saint Francis!

54:36.190 --> 54:38.401
Is Rosaline,
that thou didst love so dear,

54:38.484 --> 54:39.902
so soon forsaken?

54:39.986 --> 54:41.904
Thou doest not mock me, Father!

54:41.988 --> 54:44.907
Young men's love then lies
not truly in their hearts,

54:44.991 --> 54:46.409
but in their eyes.

54:46.492 --> 54:47.910
Hear me, Father.

54:47.994 --> 54:49.912
Jesu Maria!
What a deal of brine

54:49.996 --> 54:52.415
hath washed thy sallow cheeks
for Rosaline!

54:52.498 --> 54:53.916
And art thou changed?

54:54.000 --> 54:55.418
Pronounce this
sentence then.

54:55.501 --> 54:58.379
Women may fall when
there's no strength in men.

54:58.504 --> 55:00.882
Thou chidst me oft
for loving Rosaline.

55:01.007 --> 55:02.884
Doting, not for loving,
pupil mine.

55:03.009 --> 55:06.095
Yes, for loving and,
and badest me bury love.

55:06.220 --> 55:09.098
Not in a grave
to lay one in,

55:09.182 --> 55:10.683
another out to have.

55:25.907 --> 55:28.409
Come, young waverer,

55:28.409 --> 55:30.912
come, go with me.

55:30.912 --> 55:34.916
In one respect
I'll thy assistant be.

55:34.916 --> 55:36.417
O Father!

55:37.794 --> 55:40.380
For this alliance
may so happy prove

55:40.505 --> 55:42.882
to turn your households'
rancor to pure love.

55:43.007 --> 55:44.384
O, let us hence!

55:44.509 --> 55:46.386
I stand on sudden haste.

55:46.511 --> 55:47.887
Shh! Wisely and slow,

55:48.012 --> 55:50.890
they stumble
that run fast.

55:51.015 --> 55:52.392
Ha ha ha!

55:52.517 --> 55:53.893
Shh!

55:57.981 --> 56:00.400
Where the devil
should this Romeo be?

56:00.483 --> 56:01.901
Hmm?

56:03.403 --> 56:05.279
Came he not home tonight?

56:05.405 --> 56:07.782
Hmm?

56:07.907 --> 56:09.283
Huh?

56:09.409 --> 56:11.285
Came he not home tonight?

56:11.411 --> 56:12.286
Who?

56:12.412 --> 56:13.496
Romeo.

56:13.579 --> 56:17.291
O no, not to his father's.
I spoke with his man.

56:17.417 --> 56:19.919
Hey, Tybalt, the kinsman
to old Capulet,

56:19.919 --> 56:22.880
hath sent a letter
to his father's house.

56:24.382 --> 56:26.384
A challenge, on my life.

56:26.384 --> 56:27.885
Romeo will answer it.

56:27.885 --> 56:30.888
Any man that can write
may answer a letter.

56:30.888 --> 56:33.891
Nay, he will answer
the letter's master,

56:33.891 --> 56:35.893
how he dares,
being dared.

56:35.893 --> 56:38.396
Alas, poor Romeo,
he is already dead;

56:38.396 --> 56:40.898
stabbed with
a white wench's black eye;

56:40.898 --> 56:43.901
run through the ear
with a love song;

56:43.901 --> 56:46.904
the very pin
of his heart cleft

56:46.988 --> 56:49.907
with the blind
bow-boy's buttshaft.

56:52.201 --> 56:54.912
And is he a man
to encounter Tybalt?

56:54.912 --> 56:57.790
Why, what is Tybalt!

56:57.790 --> 57:01.586
More than Prince of Cats,
I can tell you.

57:07.091 --> 57:08.718
Ah, good morrow
to you both.

57:11.888 --> 57:13.806
(sniff)

57:13.890 --> 57:16.309
That we should be
thus afflicted

57:16.392 --> 57:18.811
with these
strange flies,

57:18.895 --> 57:20.897
these fashionmongers,

57:20.897 --> 57:24.400
these pardonnez moi's.

57:24.400 --> 57:25.902
Ah, Signor Romeo,

57:25.902 --> 57:27.403
Bonjour.

57:27.403 --> 57:28.905
Bonjour.

57:28.905 --> 57:31.407
There's a French salutation
to your French slop.

57:31.407 --> 57:32.909
Huh?

57:32.909 --> 57:35.411
You gave us the counterfeit
fairly last night.

57:35.411 --> 57:37.413
What counterfeit
did I give you?

57:37.413 --> 57:39.415
The slip, sir, the slip,

57:39.415 --> 57:40.792
can you not conceive?

57:40.917 --> 57:42.210
Pardon, good Mercutio.

57:42.293 --> 57:43.586
My business was great--

57:43.711 --> 57:44.921
Oh! Ha ha ha!

57:44.921 --> 57:46.881
In such a case as mine

57:46.881 --> 57:48.383
a man may strain courtesy.

57:48.383 --> 57:49.884
Come between us,
good Benvolio;

57:49.884 --> 57:51.386
my wit faints.

57:51.511 --> 57:53.388
Thy wit is
very bitter sweeting

57:53.513 --> 57:54.889
it is most sharp sauce.

57:55.014 --> 57:56.891
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

57:57.016 --> 57:58.393
Ha ha ha!

57:58.518 --> 58:00.395
Why, is not this
better now

58:00.520 --> 58:02.605
than groaning for love?

58:02.689 --> 58:05.316
Now art thou sociable,

58:05.400 --> 58:07.318
now art thou Romeo;

58:07.402 --> 58:09.821
now art thou
what thou art,

58:09.904 --> 58:12.782
by art as well as
by nature.

58:12.907 --> 58:15.284
For this driveling love
is like a great natural

58:15.410 --> 58:16.786
that runs malling
up and down

58:16.911 --> 58:18.788
to hide his bauble
in a hole.

58:18.913 --> 58:20.289
Stop there,
stop there.

58:20.415 --> 58:23.292
Thou desirest me to stop
in my tale against the hair?

58:23.418 --> 58:25.294
Thou wouldst else
have made thy tale large.

58:25.420 --> 58:26.879
No, no, no,
thou art deceived;

58:26.879 --> 58:30.383
For I was come to
the whole depth of my tale,

58:30.383 --> 58:32.510
and meant to occupy
the argument no longer.

58:37.890 --> 58:39.308
Here's goodly gear.

58:39.392 --> 58:40.810
(laughter)

58:40.893 --> 58:43.604
Here's a fine barge.

58:43.688 --> 58:44.814
A sail.

58:44.897 --> 58:46.816
(all)
A sail, a sail.

58:46.899 --> 58:48.818
(laughter)

58:51.779 --> 58:56.492
Two, two; a shirt
and a smock.

58:56.492 --> 58:58.286
(laughter)

58:58.411 --> 58:59.787
Shh!

58:59.912 --> 59:00.788
Peter.

59:00.913 --> 59:03.207
Anon.

59:03.291 --> 59:05.418
My fan, Peter.

59:05.501 --> 59:07.003
Good, Peter,
to hide her face,

59:07.003 --> 59:09.213
for her fan's
the fairer of the two.

59:09.297 --> 59:11.090
Ha ha ha!

59:11.215 --> 59:12.717
Oh!

59:13.801 --> 59:16.304
God ye good morrow,
gentlemen.

59:16.387 --> 59:18.598
God ye good den,
fair gentlewoman.

59:18.681 --> 59:20.183
Is it good den,
I pray?

59:20.183 --> 59:22.810
Well, 'tis no less
I tell you,

59:22.810 --> 59:25.104
for the bawdy hand
of the dial

59:25.188 --> 59:27.106
is now upon the prick
of noon.

59:27.190 --> 59:28.816
Ha ha ha! Oh!

59:28.816 --> 59:31.486
Out upon you,
what a man are you?

59:31.486 --> 59:35.281
One, gentlewoman, that God
hath made himself to mar.

59:35.281 --> 59:38.284
By my troth
it is well said,

59:38.284 --> 59:40.787
for himself to mar
quoth 'a?

59:40.787 --> 59:42.288
Hmm.

59:42.288 --> 59:45.291
Gentleman, can any
of you tell me

59:45.416 --> 59:47.001
where I may find
young Romeo?

59:47.085 --> 59:50.797
(all)
Romeo, Romeo.

59:50.880 --> 59:52.298
Hey!

59:52.382 --> 59:53.800
Shh!

59:53.883 --> 59:56.302
I am the youngest
of that name

59:56.386 --> 59:57.804
for fault of a worse.

59:57.887 --> 01:00:00.306
If you be he, sir,

01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:03.393
I desire some
conference with you.

01:00:03.518 --> 01:00:05.687
(jeering and laughing)

01:00:08.398 --> 01:00:10.692
She will indite him
to some supper.

01:00:10.817 --> 01:00:12.193
A bawd, a bawd.

01:00:17.782 --> 01:00:19.283
A bawd!

01:00:19.409 --> 01:00:21.285
Aah!

01:00:21.285 --> 01:00:24.580
(laughter)

01:00:24.706 --> 01:00:26.791
You filthy varmint you!

01:00:26.791 --> 01:00:28.710
Here she comes!

01:00:28.793 --> 01:00:30.294
Mercutio, no!

01:00:30.294 --> 01:00:32.296
Aah!

01:00:32.296 --> 01:00:34.799
An old hare hoar

01:00:34.799 --> 01:00:37.593
And an old hare hoar

01:00:37.593 --> 01:00:41.389
Is very good meat,
in lent

01:00:41.514 --> 01:00:44.809
But a hare
that is a hoar

01:00:44.809 --> 01:00:48.813
Is too much
for a score

01:00:48.896 --> 01:00:51.983
When it hoars
ere it be spent

01:00:52.108 --> 01:00:53.109
(nurse) Aah!

01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:54.402
(laughter and cheering)

01:00:54.485 --> 01:00:56.487
Ooh!

01:00:56.612 --> 01:00:59.907
(laughter)

01:00:59.991 --> 01:01:03.911
Farewell, ancient lady.

01:01:03.995 --> 01:01:05.705
Ooh!

01:01:05.788 --> 01:01:08.708
(laughter and shouting)

01:01:08.708 --> 01:01:12.712
Scurvy knave,
scurvy knave.

01:01:12.795 --> 01:01:15.006
I'm none of
his flirt-gills.

01:01:15.006 --> 01:01:17.884
I'm none of
his skein mates.

01:01:18.009 --> 01:01:20.720
Er, cur, lousy knave,

01:01:20.803 --> 01:01:23.681
lousy, lousy knave.

01:01:23.806 --> 01:01:25.099
I pray you, sir.

01:01:25.183 --> 01:01:27.101
What saucy merchant
was this

01:01:27.185 --> 01:01:28.895
that was so full
of his property?

01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:31.481
A gentleman, nurse, that loves
to hear himself talk,

01:01:31.606 --> 01:01:33.608
and will speak
more in a minute

01:01:33.691 --> 01:01:35.610
than he will stand to
in a month.

01:01:35.693 --> 01:01:36.903
I'll take him down,

01:01:36.986 --> 01:01:38.905
an 'a were lustier
than he is,

01:01:38.988 --> 01:01:40.198
and twenty such jacks;

01:01:40.281 --> 01:01:43.701
and if I cannot,
I'll find those that shall.

01:01:43.785 --> 01:01:45.787
Ha ha ha!

01:01:46.913 --> 01:01:50.792
Ha ha ha!

01:01:50.792 --> 01:01:55.296
And thou must
stand by too

01:01:55.296 --> 01:01:57.715
and suffer every knave

01:01:57.799 --> 01:02:00.510
to use me
at his pleasure.

01:02:00.593 --> 01:02:04.180
Ooh...

01:02:04.305 --> 01:02:07.183
Punk rampant!

01:02:07.308 --> 01:02:10.186
Pray you, sir,
a word.

01:02:10.311 --> 01:02:11.604
Ooh!

01:02:16.818 --> 01:02:18.695
Beef wit.

01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:22.699
(organ playing)

01:02:39.799 --> 01:02:42.301
(choir singing)

01:03:01.321 --> 01:03:05.199
My young lady bid me
inquire you out.

01:03:05.283 --> 01:03:07.702
What she did
bid me say,

01:03:07.785 --> 01:03:09.704
I will keep to myself;,

01:03:09.787 --> 01:03:12.206
but first
let me tell ye,

01:03:12.290 --> 01:03:15.710
if ye should lead her
in a fool's paradise--

01:03:15.793 --> 01:03:17.211
Nurse.

01:03:17.295 --> 01:03:18.713
Shh! As they say,

01:03:18.796 --> 01:03:21.215
it were a very gross
kind of behavior;,

01:03:21.299 --> 01:03:22.717
for the gentlewoman
is young;

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.219
and therefore if you
should deal double with her,

01:03:25.303 --> 01:03:28.681
it were an ill thing to be
offered to any gentlewoman,

01:03:28.806 --> 01:03:30.183
and very
weak dealing.

01:03:30.308 --> 01:03:33.686
Nurse, commend me
to thy lady and mistress,

01:03:33.811 --> 01:03:35.813
I protest unto thee.

01:03:35.897 --> 01:03:37.315
Bid her devise,

01:03:37.398 --> 01:03:40.818
some means to come to
shrift this afternoon,

01:03:40.818 --> 01:03:44.781
and there she shall
at Friar Laurence's cell

01:03:44.781 --> 01:03:48.993
be shrived and married.

01:03:48.993 --> 01:03:51.287
Oh!

01:03:51.287 --> 01:03:52.789
Oh!

01:03:54.290 --> 01:03:55.792
Here's for thy pains.

01:03:55.917 --> 01:03:58.795
No, no truly, sir,
not a penny.

01:03:58.795 --> 01:04:00.797
Go to,
I say you shall.

01:04:00.797 --> 01:04:01.881
No.

01:04:02.006 --> 01:04:03.716
Well...

01:04:07.303 --> 01:04:10.306
Sir, my mistress
is the sweetest lady.

01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:13.184
Lord, Lord, when she were
a little prating thing.

01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:14.686
Good-bye. Oh!

01:04:14.811 --> 01:04:16.688
O there is
a noble man in town,

01:04:16.813 --> 01:04:18.690
One Paris, that would fain
lay knife aboard.

01:04:18.815 --> 01:04:22.694
I anger her sometimes and say
that Paris is the properer man.

01:04:22.819 --> 01:04:25.196
Nurse, commend me
to thy lady.

01:04:25.279 --> 01:04:26.698
A thousand times.

01:04:26.781 --> 01:04:29.617
Ooh! Ooh!

01:04:54.309 --> 01:04:55.810
(sighs)

01:04:55.810 --> 01:04:59.814
The clock struck nine
when I did send the nurse,

01:04:59.814 --> 01:05:03.693
in half an hour
she promised to return...

01:05:03.818 --> 01:05:06.195
perchance
she cannot meet him;

01:05:06.321 --> 01:05:08.197
ahh, that's not so,

01:05:08.281 --> 01:05:10.199
oh, she's lame,

01:05:10.283 --> 01:05:12.702
love's heralds
should be thoughts!

01:05:14.287 --> 01:05:16.706
Had she affections
and warm youthful blood,

01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:19.208
she would be
as swift in motion

01:05:19.292 --> 01:05:20.710
as a ball.

01:05:20.793 --> 01:05:24.714
But old folks,
many feign as they were dead,

01:05:24.797 --> 01:05:28.718
unwieldy, slow, heavy...

01:05:28.801 --> 01:05:31.387
And pale as lead.

01:05:35.308 --> 01:05:36.684
O God, she comes.

01:05:36.809 --> 01:05:38.186
O honey nurse,
what news?

01:05:38.186 --> 01:05:41.189
O Lord, why look'st
thou sad?

01:05:41.314 --> 01:05:42.690
Oh!

01:05:42.815 --> 01:05:44.192
Though news be sad,

01:05:44.317 --> 01:05:45.693
yet tell
them merrily.

01:05:45.818 --> 01:05:47.195
(groaning)

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:48.696
Send the man away.

01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:51.783
Peter, stay at the gate.

01:05:51.783 --> 01:05:54.285
Go on.

01:05:54.285 --> 01:05:56.287
Hast thou met
with him?

01:05:56.287 --> 01:05:57.789
Oh, I am aweary.

01:05:57.789 --> 01:05:59.290
Give me leave awhile.

01:05:59.290 --> 01:06:01.292
Fie, how my bones ache!

01:06:01.292 --> 01:06:03.711
Ooh!

01:06:03.795 --> 01:06:05.088
(groaning)

01:06:05.213 --> 01:06:08.591
Sweet, sweet...

01:06:08.716 --> 01:06:10.593
Sweet nurse.

01:06:10.718 --> 01:06:13.096
Tell me, what says my love?

01:06:13.221 --> 01:06:15.098
Ha ha ha!

01:06:15.181 --> 01:06:19.102
Your love says like
an honest gentleman,

01:06:19.185 --> 01:06:24.107
and courteous,
and kind,

01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:27.110
and handsome,
and, I warrant him,

01:06:27.193 --> 01:06:29.112
a virtuous--

01:06:29.195 --> 01:06:30.613
Where is your mother?

01:06:30.697 --> 01:06:32.115
Where is my mother?

01:06:32.198 --> 01:06:33.616
Why, she is within.

01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:35.118
Where should she be?

01:06:35.201 --> 01:06:36.619
How oddly thou repliest!

01:06:36.703 --> 01:06:39.080
"Your love says like
an honest gentleman,

01:06:39.205 --> 01:06:40.081
where is your mother?"

01:06:40.206 --> 01:06:42.709
Oh, God's lady,
are you so hot?

01:06:42.709 --> 01:06:44.210
Marry, come up I trow.

01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:46.713
Is this the poultice
for my aching bones?

01:06:46.713 --> 01:06:48.214
Henceforward do
your messages yourself.

01:06:48.214 --> 01:06:49.716
Here's such a coil!

01:06:49.716 --> 01:06:52.510
Come! What says Romeo?

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:59.183
Have you got leave
to go to shrift today?

01:06:59.183 --> 01:07:00.685
I have.

01:07:00.685 --> 01:07:02.186
(chuckling)

01:07:02.186 --> 01:07:05.690
Then, hie you hence
to Friar Laurence's cell,

01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:10.194
there stays a husband
to make you a wife.

01:07:10.194 --> 01:07:12.780
Ha ha ha!

01:07:12.905 --> 01:07:17.201
Now comes the wanton blood
up in your cheeks.

01:07:17.285 --> 01:07:20.288
They'll be in scarlet
straight at any news.

01:07:21.914 --> 01:07:23.708
Hie you to church!

01:07:23.791 --> 01:07:25.918
I'll to dinner.

01:07:25.918 --> 01:07:28.713
Honest nurse, farewell!

01:07:28.796 --> 01:07:31.090
Ha ha ha!

01:07:38.806 --> 01:07:41.684
So smile the heavens
upon this holy act,

01:07:41.809 --> 01:07:44.687
that after-hours with sorrow
chide us not.

01:07:44.812 --> 01:07:47.690
Amen, amen.

01:07:47.815 --> 01:07:49.192
Come what sorrow can,

01:07:49.317 --> 01:07:51.694
it cannot countervail
the exchange of joy

01:07:51.819 --> 01:07:54.697
that one short minute
gives me in her sight.

01:07:54.781 --> 01:07:56.699
These violent delights
have violent ends,

01:07:56.783 --> 01:07:58.201
and in
their triumph die,

01:07:58.284 --> 01:07:59.702
like fire and powder,

01:07:59.786 --> 01:08:01.704
which as
they kiss consume.

01:08:01.704 --> 01:08:03.706
The sweetest honey
is loathsome

01:08:03.706 --> 01:08:05.208
in its own...

01:08:05.208 --> 01:08:06.709
Deliciousness.

01:08:06.709 --> 01:08:08.211
Deliciousness.

01:08:08.211 --> 01:08:10.213
And in the taste
confounds the...

01:08:10.213 --> 01:08:11.506
Appetite.

01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:12.799
Appetite.

01:08:12.882 --> 01:08:16.719
Therefore
love moderately...

01:08:16.719 --> 01:08:19.180
Long love doth so.

01:08:19.305 --> 01:08:22.100
Ah, here comes
the lady.

01:08:22.183 --> 01:08:25.310
O, so light a foot will ne'er
wear out the everlasting flint.

01:08:25.395 --> 01:08:27.188
Juliet!

01:08:31.818 --> 01:08:34.194
Good even to
my ghostly confessor.

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:37.698
Romeo shall thank thee,
daughter, for us both.

01:08:37.782 --> 01:08:39.200
Ah, Juliet,

01:08:39.283 --> 01:08:42.412
if the measure of thy joy
be heaped like mine,

01:08:42.495 --> 01:08:45.206
that thy skill be
more to blazon it,

01:08:45.288 --> 01:08:46.707
then sweeten
with thy breath

01:08:46.791 --> 01:08:48.209
this neighbor air.

01:08:48.292 --> 01:08:51.212
They are but beggars
that can count their worth.

01:08:51.295 --> 01:08:54.716
But my true love is
grown to such excess,

01:08:54.716 --> 01:08:57.218
I cannot sum up
sum of half my wealth.

01:08:57.301 --> 01:08:58.720
Tsk tsk tsk!

01:08:58.803 --> 01:09:01.389
Come, come with me...

01:09:01.514 --> 01:09:03.308
We will make short work.

01:09:03.390 --> 01:09:04.809
For, by your leaves,

01:09:04.892 --> 01:09:06.810
you shall not
stay alone

01:09:06.894 --> 01:09:10.189
till holy church
incorporate two in one.

01:09:15.194 --> 01:09:17.697
(organ plays)

01:09:31.419 --> 01:09:36.381
(woman singing)

01:10:56.295 --> 01:10:59.090
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

01:10:59.215 --> 01:11:01.718
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

01:11:05.305 --> 01:11:07.807
I pray thee,
good Mercutio, let's retire.

01:11:07.890 --> 01:11:09.684
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah.

01:11:09.809 --> 01:11:11.102
The day is hot.

01:11:11.185 --> 01:11:12.312
Blah, blah, blah.

01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.315
The Capulets abroad!

01:11:15.398 --> 01:11:16.607
Ha ha ha!

01:11:16.691 --> 01:11:17.817
(groans)

01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:19.986
If we meet we shall not
'scape a brawl.

01:11:23.489 --> 01:11:24.907
For now
these hot days,

01:11:24.991 --> 01:11:26.409
is the mad
blood stirring.

01:11:29.495 --> 01:11:30.913
Mercutio,
let's retire.

01:11:30.997 --> 01:11:34.500
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah!

01:11:34.584 --> 01:11:36.919
Thou art like one
of these fellows

01:11:37.003 --> 01:11:39.380
that when he enters
the confines of a tavern

01:11:39.505 --> 01:11:41.382
claps me his sword
on the table,

01:11:41.507 --> 01:11:43.885
and says, "God send me
no need of thee:"

01:11:44.010 --> 01:11:45.386
blah, blah,
blah, blah;

01:11:45.511 --> 01:11:47.388
and by the operation
of the second cup,

01:11:47.513 --> 01:11:48.890
draws him on
the drawer,

01:11:49.015 --> 01:11:50.391
when indeed
there is no need.

01:11:50.516 --> 01:11:51.893
Am I like
such a fellow?

01:11:52.018 --> 01:11:53.394
Nay and there were
two such

01:11:53.519 --> 01:11:54.896
we should have
none shortly,

01:11:54.979 --> 01:11:56.397
for the one would kill
the other.

01:11:56.481 --> 01:11:58.399
Why thou hast
quarreled with a man

01:11:58.483 --> 01:11:59.692
for coughing
in the street,

01:11:59.817 --> 01:12:02.695
because he hath wakened thy dog
that hath lain asleep

01:12:02.695 --> 01:12:03.905
in the sun.

01:12:03.988 --> 01:12:05.406
Blah, blah, blah!

01:12:05.490 --> 01:12:09.410
And thou wilt tutor me
from quarreling! Hah!

01:12:11.496 --> 01:12:13.915
Mercutio...

01:12:13.998 --> 01:12:16.501
By my head,
here come the Capulets.

01:12:21.297 --> 01:12:24.384
By my heel,
I care not.

01:12:26.594 --> 01:12:28.888
(whistling)

01:12:40.608 --> 01:12:42.402
(gurgling)

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:47.198
Gentlemen, good den.

01:12:47.281 --> 01:12:48.908
Good den.

01:12:48.992 --> 01:12:51.494
A word
with one of you.

01:12:53.496 --> 01:12:56.416
And but one word
with one of us.

01:12:56.499 --> 01:12:57.917
Couple it
with something,

01:12:58.001 --> 01:13:00.920
make it a word
and a blow.

01:13:01.004 --> 01:13:03.381
(laughter and jeers)

01:13:05.008 --> 01:13:08.386
You shall find me
apt enough to that, sir,

01:13:08.386 --> 01:13:09.721
and you will
give me occasion.

01:13:09.804 --> 01:13:13.099
Can you not take some occasion
without the giving?

01:13:16.519 --> 01:13:19.188
Mercutio, thou
consortest with Romeo.

01:13:19.314 --> 01:13:20.898
Consort? Ha ha ha!

01:13:20.982 --> 01:13:23.192
What dost thou
make us minstrels?

01:13:23.318 --> 01:13:24.694
Ha ha ha!

01:13:24.819 --> 01:13:26.404
An you make
minstrels of us,

01:13:26.487 --> 01:13:28.906
you look to hear
nothing but discords.

01:13:28.990 --> 01:13:31.701
Here's my fiddlestick.

01:13:31.784 --> 01:13:33.995
Here's that shall
make you dance.

01:13:33.995 --> 01:13:35.288
Zounds! Consort!

01:13:35.413 --> 01:13:37.915
We talk here in
the public haunt of men.

01:13:37.999 --> 01:13:39.917
Either withdraw unto
some private place,

01:13:40.001 --> 01:13:41.919
or reason coldly
of your grievances,

01:13:42.003 --> 01:13:43.379
or else depart;

01:13:43.504 --> 01:13:45.381
here all eyes gaze on us.

01:13:45.506 --> 01:13:47.884
Men's eyes
were made to look,

01:13:48.009 --> 01:13:49.385
and let them gaze.

01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:50.887
Mercutio!

01:13:51.012 --> 01:13:52.388
I will not budge for
no man's pleasure, I.

01:13:52.513 --> 01:13:55.892
Well, peace be
with you, sir,

01:13:56.017 --> 01:13:57.894
here comes my man.

01:13:57.894 --> 01:14:00.813
Mercutio!

01:14:09.906 --> 01:14:11.282
Tybalt.

01:14:11.282 --> 01:14:13.785
Romeo, the love
I bear thee

01:14:13.785 --> 01:14:15.995
can afford no better
term than this--

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.497
thou art a villain.

01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:18.915
(whistles)

01:14:18.998 --> 01:14:22.418
Tybalt, the reason that
I have to love thee

01:14:22.502 --> 01:14:25.004
doth much excuse
the appertaining rage

01:14:25.004 --> 01:14:26.506
to such a greeting--

01:14:26.506 --> 01:14:28.508
villain am I none.

01:14:28.591 --> 01:14:30.009
Therefore farewell,

01:14:30.093 --> 01:14:32.011
I see thou knowest
not me.

01:14:32.095 --> 01:14:33.805
Ha ha ha!

01:14:33.888 --> 01:14:36.391
Boy...

01:14:36.516 --> 01:14:40.395
This shall not excuse the injuries
thou hast done me,

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:42.897
therefore turn
and draw.

01:14:42.981 --> 01:14:45.900
I do protest
I never injured thee,

01:14:45.984 --> 01:14:48.695
but love thee better
than thou canst devise.

01:14:48.695 --> 01:14:51.406
Till thou shalt know
the reason of my love.

01:14:51.489 --> 01:14:52.907
And so, good Capulet,

01:14:52.991 --> 01:14:58.287
which name I tender
as dearly as mine own,

01:14:58.413 --> 01:15:00.915
be satisfied.

01:15:00.999 --> 01:15:04.210
(crowd murmuring)

01:15:04.293 --> 01:15:06.087
Ha ha ha!

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:09.590
No, no.

01:15:16.889 --> 01:15:18.891
Ugh!

01:15:18.891 --> 01:15:20.393
Ugh!

01:15:20.393 --> 01:15:22.895
(laughter)

01:15:25.606 --> 01:15:27.400
Ha ha ha!

01:15:29.402 --> 01:15:30.903
(Benvolio) No, Mercutio.

01:15:30.987 --> 01:15:32.905
O calm, dishonorable,
vile submission!

01:15:32.989 --> 01:15:34.407
No, Mercutio, no!

01:15:34.490 --> 01:15:35.908
Leave me...

01:15:35.992 --> 01:15:37.910
Tybalt, you ratcatcher!

01:15:37.994 --> 01:15:40.580
What wouldest thou
have with me?

01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:42.081
Good King of Cats,

01:15:42.081 --> 01:15:44.917
nothing but one of
your nine lives,

01:15:45.001 --> 01:15:47.086
that I mean to
make bold withal...

01:15:47.211 --> 01:15:50.089
And as you shall
use me hereafter...

01:15:50.214 --> 01:15:52.592
Dry-beat the rest
of the eight.

01:15:52.717 --> 01:15:54.886
Please, good Mercutio.

01:15:55.011 --> 01:15:58.389
Will you pluck your sword
out of his pilcher

01:15:58.514 --> 01:15:59.891
by the ears?

01:16:00.016 --> 01:16:01.392
Make haste,

01:16:01.517 --> 01:16:04.896
lest mine be about your ears
ere it be out.

01:16:11.402 --> 01:16:12.987
I am for you, sir.

01:16:13.112 --> 01:16:14.489
Ha ha ha!

01:16:14.614 --> 01:16:16.908
Gentle Mercutio,
put thy rapier up.

01:16:18.409 --> 01:16:20.411
Come, come.

01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:24.415
(cheering)

01:16:28.711 --> 01:16:30.380
Benvolio, beat down
their weapons!

01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:32.382
Gentlemen, for shame!
Forbear this outrage!

01:16:32.382 --> 01:16:34.884
The Prince expressly hath
forbid this bandying

01:16:34.884 --> 01:16:36.386
in Verona streets.

01:16:36.511 --> 01:16:38.388
Tybalt!

01:16:38.513 --> 01:16:40.598
Mercutio!

01:16:40.682 --> 01:16:42.809
Leave us!

01:16:42.892 --> 01:16:44.811
Leave us away,
you coward!

01:16:44.894 --> 01:16:45.812
Go hang thyself.

01:16:45.895 --> 01:16:47.897
(laughter)

01:16:50.483 --> 01:16:52.402
(cheering)

01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:58.408
Uh!

01:16:58.491 --> 01:16:59.909
(men)
Ha ha ha!

01:17:03.121 --> 01:17:04.706
(cheering stops)

01:17:23.516 --> 01:17:25.101
(whistling)

01:17:25.101 --> 01:17:28.396
Ha ha ha! Hey!

01:17:28.479 --> 01:17:29.897
Ha ha ha!

01:17:29.981 --> 01:17:31.899
(crowd groaning)

01:17:34.193 --> 01:17:36.404
(cheering)

01:17:40.992 --> 01:17:42.201
Ha ha ha!

01:17:42.201 --> 01:17:43.911
Hey!

01:17:47.498 --> 01:17:49.000
Aah!

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.002
Cut his hair, Tybalt!

01:17:51.002 --> 01:17:52.920
(cheering)

01:17:54.505 --> 01:17:57.508
Ha ha ha!

01:18:08.519 --> 01:18:10.396
Hey!

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:12.899
Keep your distance, Tybalt.

01:18:14.984 --> 01:18:18.196
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

01:18:18.321 --> 01:18:19.906
(laughter)

01:18:21.491 --> 01:18:24.410
Keep away, coward!

01:18:26.287 --> 01:18:30.583
Make haste, Tybalt,
we cannot wait all day.

01:18:32.502 --> 01:18:36.089
Ah, mother's baby
has dropped his sword.

01:18:36.089 --> 01:18:37.382
(laughter)

01:18:37.507 --> 01:18:39.217
Hey!

01:18:42.804 --> 01:18:43.680
Tybalt, no!

01:18:43.805 --> 01:18:46.891
Abstain from
this crusade!

01:18:47.016 --> 01:18:48.393
Tybalt, go!

01:18:48.518 --> 01:18:50.395
Mercutio, come down!

01:19:02.991 --> 01:19:04.492
Begone, begone...

01:19:04.492 --> 01:19:07.412
Fly, Tybalt.
Fly away.

01:19:11.290 --> 01:19:12.917
(cheering)

01:19:15.795 --> 01:19:17.296
I am hurt.

01:19:28.016 --> 01:19:30.393
Uh!

01:19:30.518 --> 01:19:32.186
I am hurt.

01:19:32.186 --> 01:19:33.980
(Benvolio) What! Art thou hurt?

01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:37.400
A scratch, a scratch,

01:19:37.483 --> 01:19:39.485
marry 'tis enough.

01:19:39.610 --> 01:19:42.488
Courage, man, the hurt
cannot be much.

01:19:42.613 --> 01:19:46.409
No, 'tis not so deep
as a well,

01:19:46.492 --> 01:19:49.412
nor so wide as
a church door,

01:19:49.495 --> 01:19:50.913
but 'tis enough;

01:19:50.997 --> 01:19:52.915
you ask for me
tomorrow,

01:19:52.999 --> 01:19:55.918
and you shall find me
a grave man.

01:19:56.002 --> 01:19:57.295
(cheering)

01:19:57.420 --> 01:19:59.881
Where is my page?

01:20:00.006 --> 01:20:03.009
Go, villain,
and fetch me a surgeon.

01:20:03.009 --> 01:20:04.510
Fetch me a surgeon!

01:20:04.510 --> 01:20:06.512
Ha ha ha!

01:20:06.512 --> 01:20:08.097
Did he hurt you?

01:20:20.485 --> 01:20:23.905
Why the devil
came you between us?

01:20:23.988 --> 01:20:26.407
I was hurt
under your arm.

01:20:26.491 --> 01:20:30.411
I thought all
for the best, I...

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.419
(cheering)

01:20:38.503 --> 01:20:40.880
Help me into some house,
Benvolio,

01:20:41.005 --> 01:20:42.298
or I shall faint.

01:20:47.011 --> 01:20:48.888
(crowd) Whoa!

01:20:49.013 --> 01:20:50.390
Whoa!

01:20:50.515 --> 01:20:52.392
Whoa!

01:20:52.517 --> 01:20:53.893
Whoa!

01:20:54.018 --> 01:20:55.395
Yay!

01:20:56.980 --> 01:21:00.400
A plague o'
both your houses!

01:21:04.487 --> 01:21:09.409
They have made
worms' meat of me.

01:21:11.494 --> 01:21:13.413
I have it,

01:21:13.496 --> 01:21:15.915
and soundly too...

01:21:19.002 --> 01:21:20.586
Your houses!

01:21:20.586 --> 01:21:22.213
He jests!

01:21:24.007 --> 01:21:25.883
Mercutio!

01:21:26.009 --> 01:21:27.885
(laughter)

01:21:29.512 --> 01:21:33.391
Romeo, Romeo...

01:21:33.516 --> 01:21:35.393
brave Mercutio's dead.

01:21:35.518 --> 01:21:38.396
(crowd sneers)

01:21:56.998 --> 01:21:59.417
This day's black fate,

01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:01.711
on more days doth depend.

01:22:01.794 --> 01:22:06.299
This but begins the woe
others must end.

01:22:06.299 --> 01:22:09.385
He gone in triumph!

01:22:09.385 --> 01:22:11.888
And Mercutio slain!

01:22:12.013 --> 01:22:16.392
Away to heaven,
respective lenity,

01:22:16.517 --> 01:22:19.312
and fire-eyed fury
be my conduct now!

01:22:19.395 --> 01:22:21.397
(cheering)

01:22:21.481 --> 01:22:22.899
Tybalt!

01:22:24.484 --> 01:22:26.986
Tybalt!

01:22:26.986 --> 01:22:29.405
Romeo!

01:22:33.493 --> 01:22:35.411
Tybalt!

01:22:35.495 --> 01:22:36.913
Romeo!

01:22:38.206 --> 01:22:41.709
This way!

01:22:41.793 --> 01:22:43.920
Tybalt!

01:22:44.003 --> 01:22:46.381
Romeo!

01:22:46.506 --> 01:22:48.883
Tybalt!

01:22:55.014 --> 01:22:57.892
Now, Tybalt...

01:22:58.017 --> 01:22:59.894
Take the villain
back again,

01:23:00.019 --> 01:23:02.397
that late thou gav'st me;

01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:03.898
for Mercutio's soul

01:23:03.982 --> 01:23:06.901
is but a little way
above our heads,

01:23:06.985 --> 01:23:09.904
staying for thine
to keep him company:

01:23:09.904 --> 01:23:12.407
either thou, or l, or both,

01:23:12.407 --> 01:23:13.908
must go with him!

01:23:13.908 --> 01:23:15.910
Aah!

01:23:19.914 --> 01:23:22.792
Let him go!
Let him go!

01:23:28.881 --> 01:23:31.384
Sword, Romeo.

01:23:33.219 --> 01:23:34.721
O thou wretched boy,

01:23:34.721 --> 01:23:36.681
that didst
consort him here,

01:23:36.681 --> 01:23:38.182
shalt with him hence.

01:23:38.391 --> 01:23:39.892
This shall
determine that.

01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:55.283
Hit the feet, Romeo!

01:23:56.784 --> 01:23:59.495
Protect the eyes, Romeo!

01:24:00.788 --> 01:24:03.291
(cheering and shouting)

01:24:08.504 --> 01:24:10.506
Give me your sword.

01:24:24.812 --> 01:24:26.189
Watch his feet!

01:24:26.314 --> 01:24:30.193
(crowd shouting)

01:24:57.303 --> 01:24:59.305
Hyah!

01:25:00.807 --> 01:25:04.310
(crowd shouting)

01:25:12.819 --> 01:25:15.196
(Romeo) Give me the sword!

01:25:15.279 --> 01:25:16.614
The sword!

01:25:16.614 --> 01:25:18.616
The sword!

01:25:18.616 --> 01:25:20.201
(crowd shouting)

01:25:50.982 --> 01:25:52.483
Romeo! Romeo!

01:26:15.214 --> 01:26:16.215
(Tybalt) The sword!

01:26:16.299 --> 01:26:18.092
The sword!

01:26:18.217 --> 01:26:19.719
Give it to me!

01:26:19.802 --> 01:26:21.304
Your sword, Romeo!

01:26:21.387 --> 01:26:22.889
The sword, Romeo!

01:26:25.391 --> 01:26:27.101
(shouting stops)

01:26:27.101 --> 01:26:28.895
Aah!

01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:30.688
(Tybalt drops sword)

01:26:35.693 --> 01:26:37.195
Tybalt!

01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.113
(crowd gasps)

01:26:42.909 --> 01:26:45.119
Romeo, away, be gone.

01:26:45.203 --> 01:26:46.621
The citizens are up.

01:26:46.704 --> 01:26:48.081
Stand not amazed,

01:26:48.206 --> 01:26:50.208
the Prince will
doom thee death,

01:26:50.208 --> 01:26:51.501
if thou art taken.

01:26:51.584 --> 01:26:53.086
Hence, go away!

01:26:53.211 --> 01:26:54.712
Romeo!

01:26:59.092 --> 01:27:02.720
Oh, I am fortune's fool!

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:05.807
Oh, Romeo!
Away, away!

01:27:11.896 --> 01:27:14.190
A curse on the Montagues!

01:27:14.190 --> 01:27:17.485
Oh, Tybalt!

01:27:17.610 --> 01:27:19.195
Tybalt! Tybalt!

01:27:19.195 --> 01:27:21.197
The best friend I had,

01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:24.409
oh, courteous Tybalt,
honest gentleman,

01:27:24.492 --> 01:27:27.996
that ever I should live
to see thee dead!

01:27:27.996 --> 01:27:29.205
Oh, God!

01:27:29.288 --> 01:27:31.207
Did Romeo's hand
shed Tybalt's blood?

01:27:31.290 --> 01:27:34.210
It did, it did,
alas the day, it did!

01:27:34.293 --> 01:27:35.712
Oh, nurse,

01:27:35.795 --> 01:27:40.216
oh, serpent heart,
hid with a flow'ring face!

01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:43.219
Was ever book containing
such vile matter

01:27:43.303 --> 01:27:45.179
so fairly bound?

01:27:45.305 --> 01:27:47.181
(crying)

01:27:50.310 --> 01:27:52.186
There's no faith,
no trust,

01:27:52.312 --> 01:27:53.688
no honesty in men;

01:27:53.813 --> 01:27:56.190
all perjured,
all forsworn,

01:27:56.316 --> 01:27:58.693
all naught,
all dissemblers.

01:27:58.818 --> 01:28:00.611
Shame come to Romeo.

01:28:00.695 --> 01:28:04.198
Blistered be thy tongue
for such a wish.

01:28:04.282 --> 01:28:06.701
He was not born
to shame.

01:28:06.784 --> 01:28:09.495
Upon his brow shame
is ashamed to sit.

01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:12.081
Will you speak well of him
that killed your cousin?

01:28:12.206 --> 01:28:15.710
Shall I speak ill of him
that is my husband?

01:28:15.710 --> 01:28:17.211
(crying)

01:28:17.211 --> 01:28:19.714
(crying)

01:28:19.714 --> 01:28:22.216
Poor my lord,

01:28:22.216 --> 01:28:24.719
what tongue shall
smooth thy name

01:28:24.719 --> 01:28:27.180
when I
thy three-hours wife

01:28:27.305 --> 01:28:29.307
have mangled it?

01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:32.018
(crying)

01:28:32.101 --> 01:28:35.480
But wherefore villain,
didst thou kill my cousin?

01:28:35.688 --> 01:28:38.316
Capulet! To the prince!

01:28:38.399 --> 01:28:39.692
(crowd shouting)

01:29:05.802 --> 01:29:08.096
Speak, Benvolio, speak!

01:29:12.809 --> 01:29:14.686
Go on, speak.

01:29:14.811 --> 01:29:16.688
Prince!
As thou art true,

01:29:16.813 --> 01:29:18.982
for blood of ours
shed blood of Montague.

01:29:19.107 --> 01:29:22.193
(crowd shouting)

01:29:22.193 --> 01:29:25.196
Benvolio, who began
this bloody fray?

01:29:25.196 --> 01:29:26.781
Tybalt, here slain.

01:29:26.906 --> 01:29:28.700
(Lady Capulet) No!

01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:32.203
Romeo did
speak him fair,

01:29:32.203 --> 01:29:35.206
bid him bethink how nice
the quarrel was,

01:29:35.289 --> 01:29:37.083
and urged withal
your high displeasure.

01:29:37.208 --> 01:29:38.501
It's true, Prince.

01:29:38.584 --> 01:29:40.211
The picture
makes him false.

01:29:40.294 --> 01:29:41.713
He speaks not true.

01:29:41.796 --> 01:29:43.798
(crowd shouting)

01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:48.886
I beg for justice,

01:29:49.012 --> 01:29:51.681
which thou,
Prince must give.

01:29:51.806 --> 01:29:56.811
Romeo slew Tybalt,
Romeo must not live.

01:29:56.894 --> 01:29:59.397
(crowd shouting)

01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:01.399
Romeo slew him.

01:30:12.201 --> 01:30:13.995
He slew Mercutio.

01:30:20.710 --> 01:30:24.505
Who now the price
of his dear blood doth owe?

01:30:29.218 --> 01:30:31.679
Not Romeo, Prince...

01:30:31.679 --> 01:30:34.182
He was Mercutio's friend.

01:30:34.182 --> 01:30:38.186
His fault concludes
but what the law should end.

01:30:38.186 --> 01:30:40.313
The life of Tybalt!

01:30:40.396 --> 01:30:41.689
And for that offense,

01:30:41.814 --> 01:30:43.191
immediately we do
exile him hence.

01:30:45.318 --> 01:30:48.696
(Prince) Let Romeo
hence in haste,

01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:51.199
else, when he's found...

01:30:51.282 --> 01:30:54.410
That hour is his last.

01:31:07.215 --> 01:31:09.092
(crying)

01:31:09.217 --> 01:31:11.594
Ah, banishment...

01:31:11.719 --> 01:31:13.096
Be merciful, say death!

01:31:13.221 --> 01:31:14.597
(banging)

01:31:14.681 --> 01:31:16.808
Do not say banishment.

01:31:16.891 --> 01:31:18.101
Arise.

01:31:18.184 --> 01:31:21.187
One knocks;
good Romeo, hide thyself.

01:31:21.187 --> 01:31:22.480
Who's there?

01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:23.690
(bang bang)

01:31:23.690 --> 01:31:26.192
Who knocks so hard?

01:31:26.192 --> 01:31:28.695
Whence come you?

01:31:28.695 --> 01:31:30.196
What's your will?

01:31:30.196 --> 01:31:32.198
(nurse) Let me come in,

01:31:32.198 --> 01:31:34.701
and you shall know
my errand.

01:31:34.701 --> 01:31:36.703
I come from
Lady Juliet.

01:31:36.703 --> 01:31:39.205
(Romeo crying)

01:31:39.205 --> 01:31:41.207
Welcome then.

01:31:41.207 --> 01:31:43.710
Holy friar,
o tell me, holy friar,

01:31:43.710 --> 01:31:45.712
where's my lady's lord,
where's Romeo?

01:31:45.712 --> 01:31:48.381
There, on the ground.

01:31:48.506 --> 01:31:50.008
With his own tears
made drunk.

01:31:50.008 --> 01:31:53.720
(Romeo) There is no world
without Verona walls.

01:31:53.803 --> 01:31:56.180
Even so lies she,

01:31:56.306 --> 01:31:57.682
blubbering and weeping,

01:31:57.807 --> 01:31:59.183
weeping and blubbering.

01:31:59.309 --> 01:32:00.685
(crying)

01:32:00.810 --> 01:32:02.186
Stand up!

01:32:02.312 --> 01:32:05.690
Stand and you
be a man.

01:32:05.815 --> 01:32:08.109
For Juliet's sake,
for her sake,

01:32:08.192 --> 01:32:09.610
rise and stand.

01:32:09.694 --> 01:32:13.114
Why should you fall
into so deep an 'ole?

01:32:13.197 --> 01:32:14.615
Nurse.

01:32:14.699 --> 01:32:17.618
Ah, sir, death's
the end of all.

01:32:17.702 --> 01:32:19.120
Speakst thou of Juliet?

01:32:19.203 --> 01:32:20.580
How is it with her?

01:32:20.705 --> 01:32:23.207
Does she not think
me an old murderer?

01:32:23.207 --> 01:32:25.710
Where is she?
How doth she?

01:32:25.710 --> 01:32:27.211
What says
my concealed lady

01:32:27.211 --> 01:32:28.713
to our canceled love?

01:32:28.713 --> 01:32:31.716
She says nothing, sir,
but weeps and weeps,

01:32:31.716 --> 01:32:33.885
and Tybalt calls,
and then on Romeo cries.

01:32:34.010 --> 01:32:36.888
As if that name
did murder her.

01:32:37.013 --> 01:32:39.682
O tell me, friar,
tell me,

01:32:39.682 --> 01:32:42.685
in what vile part
of this anatomy

01:32:42.685 --> 01:32:44.187
doth my name lodge?

01:32:44.187 --> 01:32:48.399
Tell me that I may sack
the hateful mansion!

01:32:48.399 --> 01:32:49.692
(nurse screaming)

01:32:49.692 --> 01:32:51.194
Hold thy
desperate hand.

01:32:51.194 --> 01:32:52.695
By heavens!
Leave it!

01:32:55.782 --> 01:32:58.201
Thou hast amazed me.

01:32:58.284 --> 01:33:00.203
Thou a man?

01:33:00.286 --> 01:33:02.705
Thy form
cries out thou art.

01:33:02.789 --> 01:33:04.707
Thy tears
are womanish,

01:33:04.791 --> 01:33:08.586
thy wild acts denote the
unreasonable fury of a beast.

01:33:08.711 --> 01:33:10.588
Hast thou slain Tybalt?

01:33:10.713 --> 01:33:13.091
Wilt thou slay thyself,
and slay thy lady,

01:33:13.216 --> 01:33:14.592
that in thy life lives,

01:33:14.717 --> 01:33:16.094
by doing damned hate
upon thyself?

01:33:16.219 --> 01:33:18.596
Rouse thee, man...

01:33:20.682 --> 01:33:22.100
Thy Juliet is alive.

01:33:22.183 --> 01:33:24.602
There art thou happy.

01:33:24.686 --> 01:33:26.104
Tybalt would kill thee,

01:33:26.187 --> 01:33:27.605
but thou slewest Tybalt;

01:33:27.689 --> 01:33:29.107
there art thou happy.

01:33:29.190 --> 01:33:32.193
The law that threatened death
becomes thy friend,

01:33:32.193 --> 01:33:34.112
and turns it to exile;

01:33:34.112 --> 01:33:35.613
there art thou happy.

01:33:35.613 --> 01:33:39.200
A pack of blessings
light upon thy back...

01:33:41.703 --> 01:33:44.288
Ascend her chamber,
hence and comfort her.

01:33:45.707 --> 01:33:49.210
But look thou stay
not till the watch be set,

01:33:49.210 --> 01:33:51.713
for then thou canst not
pass to Mantua,

01:33:51.713 --> 01:33:54.716
where thou shalt live
till we find a time

01:33:54.716 --> 01:33:57.218
to blaze your marriage,
reconcile your friends,

01:33:57.218 --> 01:34:00.179
beg pardon of the Prince,
and call thee home,

01:34:00.179 --> 01:34:03.182
with twenty hundred
thousand times more joy

01:34:03.308 --> 01:34:05.310
than thou wentest forth
in lamentation.

01:34:08.688 --> 01:34:10.106
Go before, nurse...

01:34:10.189 --> 01:34:11.607
Commend me to thy lady,

01:34:11.691 --> 01:34:14.610
and bid her hasten
all the house to bed,

01:34:14.694 --> 01:34:17.613
which heavy sorrow
makes them apt unto

01:34:17.697 --> 01:34:19.615
Romeo's coming.

01:35:13.002 --> 01:35:15.004
(birds chirping)

01:36:25.283 --> 01:36:28.119
Wilt thou be gone?

01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:35.585
It is not yet
near day.

01:36:35.585 --> 01:36:38.588
It was the nightingale,
and not the lark,

01:36:38.588 --> 01:36:43.593
that pierced the fearful hollow
of thine ear.

01:36:43.593 --> 01:36:46.679
Nightly she sings
on yond pomegranate tree.

01:36:46.679 --> 01:36:49.098
Oh, believe me, love,

01:36:49.098 --> 01:36:52.602
it was the nightingale.

01:36:52.685 --> 01:36:55.605
It was the lark...

01:36:55.688 --> 01:36:58.608
The herald of the morn,

01:36:58.691 --> 01:37:00.610
no nightingale.

01:37:02.195 --> 01:37:07.116
Night's candles
are burnt out...

01:37:13.206 --> 01:37:20.588
And jocund day stands tiptoe
on the misty mountaintops.

01:37:23.216 --> 01:37:26.094
I must be gone and live,

01:37:26.219 --> 01:37:28.388
or stay and die.

01:37:30.181 --> 01:37:34.102
Yond light is not
daylight...

01:37:34.185 --> 01:37:37.105
I know it, I.

01:37:39.691 --> 01:37:41.985
Therefore stay yet,

01:37:41.985 --> 01:37:45.113
thou needst not
to be gone.

01:37:45.196 --> 01:37:46.614
Oh, let me be taken,

01:37:46.698 --> 01:37:49.117
let me be put to death.

01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:52.120
I am content so thou
wilt have it so.

01:37:52.203 --> 01:37:55.081
I'll say yon gray
is not the morning's eye,

01:37:55.206 --> 01:37:57.083
nor that is not
the lark

01:37:57.208 --> 01:37:59.711
whose notes do beat
the vaulty heavens

01:37:59.711 --> 01:38:01.004
so high above
our heads.

01:38:01.087 --> 01:38:06.217
I have more care
to stay than will to go.

01:38:06.217 --> 01:38:09.595
Come death, and welcome,
Juliet wills it so.

01:38:09.721 --> 01:38:12.098
(lark chirping)

01:38:12.181 --> 01:38:14.600
It is...

01:38:14.684 --> 01:38:17.520
It is, hie hence,
be gone away.

01:38:17.603 --> 01:38:20.481
Romeo, it is.

01:38:23.693 --> 01:38:27.613
It is the lark that
sings so out of tune,

01:38:27.697 --> 01:38:32.118
straining harsh discords,
and unpleasing sharps.

01:38:32.201 --> 01:38:35.079
Some say the lark
makes sweet division;

01:38:35.204 --> 01:38:39.083
oh, this doth not so,
for she divideth us.

01:38:39.208 --> 01:38:40.585
So now be gone,

01:38:40.710 --> 01:38:42.795
more light and light
it grows.

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:44.297
More light and light,

01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:49.093
more dark and dark
our woes.

01:38:49.218 --> 01:38:51.220
(banging on door)

01:38:51.304 --> 01:38:52.597
(nurse) Madam!

01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:55.600
Your lady mother
comes to your chamber.

01:38:57.685 --> 01:38:59.103
Nurse.

01:38:59.187 --> 01:39:02.106
Your lady mother is
coming to your chamber.

01:39:02.190 --> 01:39:04.108
The day is broke,
look about.

01:39:06.319 --> 01:39:08.613
Oh, art thou gone so,

01:39:08.696 --> 01:39:10.114
my husband, friend?

01:39:10.198 --> 01:39:13.618
I must hear from thee
every day in the hour,

01:39:13.701 --> 01:39:16.120
for in a minute
there are many days,

01:39:16.204 --> 01:39:19.582
o by this count
I shall be much in years,

01:39:19.707 --> 01:39:21.584
ere I again behold my Romeo.

01:39:21.709 --> 01:39:23.586
I will omit
no opportunity

01:39:23.711 --> 01:39:26.089
that may convey
my greetings, love, to thee.

01:39:28.716 --> 01:39:31.594
Oh, think'st thou
we shall ever meet again?

01:39:33.221 --> 01:39:36.099
I doubt it not,

01:39:36.182 --> 01:39:38.601
and all these woes
shall serve

01:39:38.685 --> 01:39:42.105
for sweet discourses
in our time to come.

01:39:44.190 --> 01:39:48.111
Farewell, farewell,

01:39:48.194 --> 01:39:50.613
one kiss
and I'll descend.

01:39:55.702 --> 01:39:58.579
(rooster crows)

01:40:14.721 --> 01:40:16.097
Adieu.

01:40:21.394 --> 01:40:24.397
Adieu!

01:40:26.691 --> 01:40:29.110
(crying)

01:40:29.193 --> 01:40:31.988
Oh, God!

01:40:51.007 --> 01:40:53.092
(Juliet crying)

01:40:53.217 --> 01:40:56.095
We will have vengeance
for it,

01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:57.597
fear thou not...

01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:00.099
(Juliet) No!

01:41:00.183 --> 01:41:01.601
Then weep no more.

01:41:01.684 --> 01:41:03.102
(Juliet sobbing)

01:41:07.690 --> 01:41:10.109
I'll send to one
in Mantua,

01:41:10.109 --> 01:41:13.112
where that same
banished runagate doth live

01:41:13.112 --> 01:41:17.617
shall give him such
an unaccustomed dram,

01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:20.620
that he shall soon
keep Tybalt company.

01:41:20.703 --> 01:41:23.081
(Juliet) No!

01:41:23.206 --> 01:41:27.085
But now I'll tell thee
joyful tidings, girl.

01:41:27.210 --> 01:41:30.588
Well, then thou hast
a careful father,

01:41:30.713 --> 01:41:33.591
one who to put thee
from thy heaviness

01:41:33.716 --> 01:41:36.094
hath sorted out
a sudden day of joy.

01:41:38.221 --> 01:41:41.599
And joy comes well
in such a needy time.

01:41:41.683 --> 01:41:44.602
Marry, my child,
early next Thursday morn,

01:41:44.686 --> 01:41:47.105
the gallant, young
and noble prince,

01:41:47.188 --> 01:41:50.108
the county Paris,
at St. Peter's church,

01:41:50.191 --> 01:41:53.111
shall happily make thee
there a joyful bride.

01:41:54.696 --> 01:41:58.616
Now by St. Peter's church,
and Peter too,

01:41:58.700 --> 01:42:03.121
he shall not make me there
a joyful bride!

01:42:03.204 --> 01:42:05.498
No! No!

01:42:09.502 --> 01:42:11.212
So, it is concluded.

01:42:14.590 --> 01:42:18.219
Son, Paris.

01:42:21.306 --> 01:42:25.393
How now, wife, have you
delivered to her our decree?

01:42:25.518 --> 01:42:28.104
Ay, sir,
but she will none,

01:42:28.187 --> 01:42:30.106
she gives you thanks.

01:42:30.189 --> 01:42:31.399
(crying)

01:42:31.482 --> 01:42:34.902
I would the fool were
married to her grave.

01:42:36.696 --> 01:42:41.117
Soft...
take me with you.

01:42:42.702 --> 01:42:45.079
Take me with you, wife.

01:42:45.204 --> 01:42:47.582
How? Will she none?

01:42:47.707 --> 01:42:50.084
Doth she not
give us thanks?

01:42:50.209 --> 01:42:52.587
Is she not proud?

01:42:52.712 --> 01:42:56.090
Doth she not count her blessed,
unworthy as she is,

01:42:56.215 --> 01:43:00.720
that we have wrought so worthy
a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:03.181
Wretched fool!
Let me see her!

01:43:03.306 --> 01:43:04.682
Ungrateful baggage!

01:43:04.682 --> 01:43:08.102
Say what thou wilt,
thou shalt not house with me!

01:43:08.186 --> 01:43:09.812
Fie! What, are you mad?

01:43:09.896 --> 01:43:11.606
Hang thee,
young baggage!

01:43:11.689 --> 01:43:12.815
Disobedient wretch!

01:43:12.899 --> 01:43:16.110
I tell thee what,
get thee to church on Thursday,

01:43:16.194 --> 01:43:19.113
or never after
look me in the face.

01:43:19.197 --> 01:43:21.616
Oh, father, good father,
I beseech you.

01:43:21.699 --> 01:43:24.118
Speak not, reply not,
do not answer me.

01:43:24.202 --> 01:43:25.620
My fingers itch.

01:43:25.703 --> 01:43:28.581
You are to blame, my lord,
to rate her so.

01:43:28.706 --> 01:43:30.083
And why,
my lady wisdom?

01:43:30.208 --> 01:43:31.584
Hold your tongue!

01:43:31.709 --> 01:43:34.087
Good prudence, smatter
with your gossips, go!

01:43:34.212 --> 01:43:35.588
I speak no treason.

01:43:35.713 --> 01:43:37.090
May not one speak?

01:43:37.215 --> 01:43:38.591
Speak!
You mumbling fool!

01:43:38.716 --> 01:43:40.593
Utter your gravity
o'er a gossip's bowl,

01:43:40.718 --> 01:43:42.095
for here we need it not.

01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:43.596
You are too hot.

01:43:43.596 --> 01:43:45.098
(crying)

01:43:45.181 --> 01:43:48.017
God's bread,
it makes me mad.

01:43:51.187 --> 01:43:52.313
Thursday's near.

01:43:52.397 --> 01:43:54.607
Lay hand on heart, advise.

01:43:54.691 --> 01:43:57.694
An you be mine,
I give you to my friend;

01:43:57.819 --> 01:43:59.112
an you be not,

01:43:59.195 --> 01:44:01.990
hang, beg, starve,
die in the streets.

01:44:01.990 --> 01:44:03.116
No!

01:44:03.199 --> 01:44:05.702
For by my soul,
I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,

01:44:05.785 --> 01:44:08.788
for what is mine
shall never do thee good.

01:44:08.913 --> 01:44:10.081
Father!

01:44:10.206 --> 01:44:15.086
Trust to't, bethink you,
I'll not be forsworn.

01:44:15.211 --> 01:44:16.713
(sobbing)

01:44:21.801 --> 01:44:24.804
Oh, no! No!

01:44:24.804 --> 01:44:27.598
Oh sweet, my mother,
cast me not away.

01:44:27.682 --> 01:44:30.101
Delay this marriage
for a month, a week, oh!

01:44:30.184 --> 01:44:33.187
Talk not to me,
for I'll not speak a word.

01:44:35.398 --> 01:44:38.609
Do as thou wilt,
for I have done with thee.

01:44:42.196 --> 01:44:45.491
Oh, God!

01:44:45.616 --> 01:44:46.617
Oh, nurse?

01:44:46.701 --> 01:44:48.619
How shall this
be prevented?

01:44:48.703 --> 01:44:50.580
What sayest thou?

01:44:50.705 --> 01:44:53.583
Hast thou not
a word of joy?

01:44:53.708 --> 01:44:56.002
Some comfort, nurse.

01:44:56.002 --> 01:44:58.588
Faith, here it is.

01:44:58.713 --> 01:45:01.090
Romeo is banished...

01:45:03.217 --> 01:45:05.595
And all the world
to nothing,

01:45:05.595 --> 01:45:08.598
that he dares ne'er come back
to challenge you;

01:45:08.598 --> 01:45:12.602
or if he do, it needs must
be by stealth.

01:45:12.685 --> 01:45:17.106
Then since the case so stands
as now it doth,

01:45:17.190 --> 01:45:21.986
I think it best
you marry with the county.

01:45:32.705 --> 01:45:34.082
True.

01:45:35.708 --> 01:45:38.586
O he's a lovely
gentleman.

01:45:42.090 --> 01:45:45.218
Romeo's
a dishclout to him.

01:45:46.594 --> 01:45:49.514
An eagle, madam,
hath not so green,

01:45:49.597 --> 01:45:53.017
so quick, so fair an eye
as Paris hath.

01:45:53.101 --> 01:45:54.519
Beshrew my heart,

01:45:54.602 --> 01:45:57.981
I think you happy
in this second match.

01:45:58.106 --> 01:46:00.817
It excels your first.

01:46:02.402 --> 01:46:05.905
For if it did not,
your first is dead,

01:46:05.989 --> 01:46:08.992
or 'twere as good he were
as living here,

01:46:08.992 --> 01:46:11.995
and you no use of him.

01:46:11.995 --> 01:46:14.789
Speakest thou
from thy heart?

01:46:19.002 --> 01:46:21.087
And from my soul, too...

01:46:23.506 --> 01:46:25.508
Or else
beshrew them both.

01:46:25.508 --> 01:46:27.010
Amen.

01:46:27.010 --> 01:46:28.011
(drawing curtain)

01:46:28.011 --> 01:46:29.512
What?

01:46:29.512 --> 01:46:34.309
Well, thou hast comforted me
marvelous much.

01:46:37.603 --> 01:46:40.982
Go in, and tell my lady
I am gone,

01:46:41.107 --> 01:46:42.483
having displeased my father,

01:46:42.608 --> 01:46:44.485
to Laurence's cell,

01:46:44.610 --> 01:46:47.488
to make confession
and to be absolved.

01:46:48.906 --> 01:46:52.994
Marry, I shall,
and this is wisely done.

01:46:53.119 --> 01:46:54.495
Go!

01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:27.403
You say you do not know
the lady's mind.

01:47:27.403 --> 01:47:30.406
Uneven is the course,
I like it not.

01:47:30.406 --> 01:47:32.909
Immoderately she weeps
for Tybalt's death,

01:47:32.909 --> 01:47:35.411
and therefore have I
little talked of love,

01:47:35.495 --> 01:47:38.414
for Venus smiles not
in a house of tears.

01:47:38.498 --> 01:47:39.707
(footsteps)

01:47:44.003 --> 01:47:45.380
Oh!

01:47:49.509 --> 01:47:52.512
Happily met,
my lady and my wife.

01:47:55.014 --> 01:47:58.810
That may be, sir,
when I may be a wife.

01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:03.898
Come you to make
confession to this father?

01:48:06.401 --> 01:48:08.820
Are you at leisure,
holy father, now,

01:48:08.903 --> 01:48:11.698
or shall I come to you
at evening mass?

01:48:11.781 --> 01:48:13.992
My leisure serves me,
pensive daughter, now.

01:48:14.117 --> 01:48:16.619
My lord, we must entreat
the time alone.

01:48:16.703 --> 01:48:19.414
God shield I should
disturb devotion.

01:48:19.414 --> 01:48:22.792
Juliet, on Thursday early
will I rouse thee.

01:48:24.419 --> 01:48:26.879
Till then, adieu...

01:48:28.881 --> 01:48:32.385
and keep this holy kiss.

01:48:38.099 --> 01:48:39.892
(sobbing)

01:48:39.892 --> 01:48:43.688
Oh, shut the door,
and when thou hast done so,

01:48:43.813 --> 01:48:46.399
come weep with me,
past hope,

01:48:46.482 --> 01:48:50.111
past care, past help.

01:48:59.996 --> 01:49:02.915
Oh, Juliet, I already
know thy grief.

01:49:02.999 --> 01:49:05.793
Tell me not, Friar,
that thou heard'st of this,

01:49:05.918 --> 01:49:08.796
unless thou tell me
how I can prevent it.

01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:12.300
If in thy wisdom
thou cans't give no help...

01:49:12.383 --> 01:49:14.302
(sobbing)

01:49:24.896 --> 01:49:26.481
Hold, daughter.

01:49:30.401 --> 01:49:33.404
I do spy a kind of hope,

01:49:33.404 --> 01:49:35.907
as that is desperate
which we would prevent.

01:49:38.910 --> 01:49:41.913
If rather than to marry
county Paris,

01:49:41.996 --> 01:49:43.915
thou hast
the strength of will to--

01:49:43.915 --> 01:49:45.917
O bid me leap,
rather than marry Paris,

01:49:45.917 --> 01:49:47.418
from off the battlements
of any tower,

01:49:47.418 --> 01:49:49.212
or bid me go
into a new-made grave

01:49:49.295 --> 01:49:51.881
and hide me with a dead man
in his shroud.

01:49:52.006 --> 01:49:53.007
Hold then.

01:50:06.187 --> 01:50:07.313
Go home.

01:50:08.898 --> 01:50:10.316
Be merry.

01:50:13.111 --> 01:50:15.279
Give consent
to marry Paris.

01:50:15.405 --> 01:50:16.781
Oh, no.

01:50:16.781 --> 01:50:19.701
Wednesday is tomorrow.

01:50:22.412 --> 01:50:25.415
Tomorrow night
look that thou lie alone,

01:50:25.415 --> 01:50:29.002
let not the nurse
lie with thee in thy chamber.

01:50:37.385 --> 01:50:41.014
Take thou this phial,
being then in bed...

01:50:43.391 --> 01:50:49.480
And this distilling liquor
drink thou off...

01:50:52.191 --> 01:50:55.403
When presently through
all thy veins shall run

01:50:55.486 --> 01:50:58.281
a cold and drowsy humor;,

01:50:58.406 --> 01:51:02.785
for no pulse shall keep
his native progress,

01:51:02.910 --> 01:51:04.287
but surcease;

01:51:04.412 --> 01:51:09.917
no warmth, no breath
shall testify thou livest...

01:51:13.796 --> 01:51:16.799
And in this borrowed likeness
of shrunk death

01:51:16.883 --> 01:51:22.805
thou shalt continue
two and forty hours...

01:51:28.811 --> 01:51:33.399
And then awake
as from a pleasant sleep.

01:51:36.402 --> 01:51:41.407
In the meantime,
against thou shalt awake

01:51:41.491 --> 01:51:44.786
shall Romeo by my letters
know our drift,

01:51:44.911 --> 01:51:46.788
and hither shall he come,

01:51:46.913 --> 01:51:49.290
and he and I
will watch thy waking,

01:51:49.415 --> 01:51:54.003
and that very night shall Romeo
bear thee hence to Mantua.

01:51:55.880 --> 01:51:57.382
Give me, give me!

01:51:57.507 --> 01:51:59.717
Tell me not of fear.

01:51:59.801 --> 01:52:01.594
Hold, then.

01:52:10.311 --> 01:52:11.813
Get thee gone.

01:52:11.813 --> 01:52:14.315
Be strong and prosperous
in this resolve.

01:52:50.893 --> 01:52:52.812
How now, my headstrong.

01:52:52.895 --> 01:52:54.814
Where have you
been gadding?

01:52:54.897 --> 01:52:56.816
Where I have learnt me

01:52:56.899 --> 01:52:59.319
to repent the sin
of disobedient opposition.

01:53:01.404 --> 01:53:03.281
Pardon me,
henceforward l,

01:53:03.406 --> 01:53:06.701
I am ever ruled by you.

01:53:06.784 --> 01:53:09.704
Why, I am glad on't!

01:53:09.787 --> 01:53:12.290
This is well.
Stand up.

01:53:12.290 --> 01:53:14.584
This is
as it should be.

01:53:51.913 --> 01:53:53.998
Love give me strength.

01:54:19.816 --> 01:54:22.819
Give this letter
into the hand of Romeo,

01:54:22.819 --> 01:54:23.903
in Mantua.

01:54:53.391 --> 01:54:55.810
(woman screaming)

01:54:58.896 --> 01:55:00.815
Aah!

01:55:00.898 --> 01:55:02.317
My lord! My lord!

01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:06.112
She's dead,
Juliet is dead!

01:55:06.195 --> 01:55:08.990
My Lady Juliet, my lord.
She's dead, she's dead!

01:55:08.990 --> 01:55:10.700
Juliet!

01:55:10.783 --> 01:55:12.493
Juliet!

01:55:12.619 --> 01:55:14.495
Juliet!

01:55:14.621 --> 01:55:16.581
My baby,
where is she?

01:55:19.292 --> 01:55:23.212
(Capulet) O lamentable day.

01:55:23.296 --> 01:55:27.300
Death lies on her
like an untimely frost

01:55:27.300 --> 01:55:32.096
upon the sweetest flower
of all the field.

01:55:39.812 --> 01:55:41.814
(singing in Latin)

01:56:47.297 --> 01:56:49.799
(crying)

01:57:25.793 --> 01:57:27.295
(singing stops)

01:57:46.814 --> 01:57:48.483
Master.

01:57:48.608 --> 01:57:50.109
Balthasar!

01:57:53.279 --> 01:57:54.781
How fares my Juliet?

01:57:54.781 --> 01:57:57.992
For nothing can be ill,
if she be well.

01:57:58.117 --> 01:58:00.912
How fares my lady?

01:58:07.585 --> 01:58:09.212
(sobbing)

01:58:13.299 --> 01:58:15.218
She's dead, my lord.

01:58:15.301 --> 01:58:17.220
She's dead.

01:58:17.303 --> 01:58:20.181
Her body sleeps
in capel's monument.

01:58:20.306 --> 01:58:24.185
I saw her laid low
in her kindred's vault.

01:58:34.821 --> 01:58:38.700
Then, I defy you, stars!

02:00:02.784 --> 02:00:03.785
Live...

02:00:05.411 --> 02:00:08.581
and be prosperous.

02:00:08.706 --> 02:00:11.084
Farewell, good fellow.

02:01:19.819 --> 02:01:21.112
Juliet.

02:02:11.287 --> 02:02:12.789
O my love...

02:02:17.794 --> 02:02:19.212
My wife.

02:02:21.798 --> 02:02:25.718
Death that hath sucked
the honey of thy breath,

02:02:25.802 --> 02:02:28.888
hath had no power yet
upon thy beauty.

02:02:33.810 --> 02:02:35.687
Thou art not conquered...

02:02:38.815 --> 02:02:43.695
Beauty's ensign yet
is crimson in thy lips

02:02:43.820 --> 02:02:46.197
and in thy cheeks.

02:02:47.991 --> 02:02:51.202
Death's pale flag
is not advanced there.

02:02:56.791 --> 02:02:58.793
Tybalt.

02:03:04.299 --> 02:03:08.094
Liest thou there
in thy bloody sheet?

02:03:18.479 --> 02:03:22.400
What more favor
can I do to thee,

02:03:22.483 --> 02:03:26.904
than with that hand
that cut thy youth in twain

02:03:26.988 --> 02:03:32.702
to sunder his
that was thine enemy?

02:03:39.500 --> 02:03:41.419
Forgive me, cousin.

02:03:52.013 --> 02:03:54.599
Ah, dear Juliet.

02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:02.106
Why art thou yet so fair?

02:04:04.484 --> 02:04:07.403
Shall I believe that
unsubstantial death is amorous,

02:04:07.403 --> 02:04:09.906
and that the lean
abhorred monster

02:04:09.906 --> 02:04:13.201
keeps thee here in dark
to be his paramour?

02:04:13.201 --> 02:04:19.916
For fear of that,
I still will stay with thee.

02:04:24.003 --> 02:04:29.884
Never from this palace
of dim night depart again.

02:04:32.011 --> 02:04:37.392
Here, here will I remain,

02:04:37.517 --> 02:04:42.897
with worms that are
thy chambermaids.

02:04:42.981 --> 02:04:44.691
(sobbing)

02:05:00.498 --> 02:05:04.294
Eyes, look your last.

02:05:09.882 --> 02:05:13.886
Arms, take your last embrace.

02:05:16.389 --> 02:05:21.394
And lips,
o you the doors of breath,

02:05:21.394 --> 02:05:23.396
seal with a righteous kiss

02:05:23.396 --> 02:05:26.190
a dateless bargain
to engrossing death.

02:06:04.020 --> 02:06:06.981
Here's to my love.

02:06:34.384 --> 02:06:37.512
Thus with a kiss...

02:06:39.180 --> 02:06:40.890
I die.

02:06:54.487 --> 02:06:55.905
Who's there?

02:06:55.989 --> 02:06:59.409
A friend, and one
that knows thee well.

02:06:59.492 --> 02:07:02.412
Balthasar. How long
hast thou been here?

02:07:02.495 --> 02:07:03.913
Full half an hour.

02:07:03.997 --> 02:07:06.291
Go with me to the vault.

02:07:06.416 --> 02:07:07.792
I dare not, sir.

02:07:07.917 --> 02:07:10.795
My master knows not
that I am gone hence.

02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:13.506
Stay then,
I'll go alone.

02:07:15.383 --> 02:07:17.385
Fear comes upon me.

02:07:17.385 --> 02:07:20.680
O much I fear
some ill unlucky thing.

02:07:59.510 --> 02:08:00.887
Romeo!

02:08:11.898 --> 02:08:13.816
Oh, what an unkind hour

02:08:13.900 --> 02:08:17.487
is guilty of this
lamentable chance?

02:09:00.989 --> 02:09:02.407
(Juliet) Ohh!

02:09:09.914 --> 02:09:15.211
O comfortable Friar,
where is my lord?

02:09:16.879 --> 02:09:19.799
I do remember well
where I should be,

02:09:19.882 --> 02:09:21.801
and there I am.

02:09:21.884 --> 02:09:23.803
Where is my Romeo?

02:09:23.886 --> 02:09:26.389
(trumpet plays in distance)

02:09:26.389 --> 02:09:28.391
I hear some noise.

02:09:28.391 --> 02:09:30.893
Oh, where is my Romeo?

02:09:30.893 --> 02:09:34.897
Oh, lady, come from this nest
of death, contagion,

02:09:34.897 --> 02:09:36.399
and unnatural sleep.

02:09:38.401 --> 02:09:41.404
A greater power
than we can contradict

02:09:41.404 --> 02:09:42.905
hath thwarted
our intents.

02:09:42.905 --> 02:09:45.408
Come along.
The watch is coming.

02:09:45.408 --> 02:09:47.493
Where is my Romeo?

02:09:47.619 --> 02:09:49.412
(Juliet gasps)

02:09:53.916 --> 02:09:56.210
Come. Go, good Juliet.

02:09:57.503 --> 02:09:58.880
No.

02:09:59.005 --> 02:10:00.882
I dare no longer stay.

02:10:01.007 --> 02:10:02.383
No!

02:10:02.508 --> 02:10:05.303
I dare no longer stay.

02:10:05.303 --> 02:10:06.804
Juliet!

02:10:06.888 --> 02:10:08.806
(trumpet)

02:10:08.890 --> 02:10:11.309
I dare no longer stay.

02:10:11.392 --> 02:10:13.811
I dare
no longer stay!

02:10:54.394 --> 02:10:56.521
What's here?

02:11:01.901 --> 02:11:05.613
Poison, I see,
hath been his timeless end.

02:11:09.409 --> 02:11:11.286
O churl!

02:11:11.411 --> 02:11:14.289
Drunk all,
and left no friendly drop

02:11:14.414 --> 02:11:16.291
to help me after!

02:11:16.416 --> 02:11:18.293
I will kiss thy lips;

02:11:18.418 --> 02:11:21.296
haply some poison
yet doth hang on them

02:11:21.421 --> 02:11:24.299
to make me die
with a restorative.

02:11:29.887 --> 02:11:32.307
Thy lips are warm!

02:11:43.401 --> 02:11:46.195
Oh, no, no!

02:11:56.914 --> 02:11:58.916
(man) Lead, boy, which way?

02:11:58.916 --> 02:12:00.793
Search about
the churchyard.

02:12:00.793 --> 02:12:02.420
Go, some of you...

02:12:02.420 --> 02:12:03.880
Yea, noise?

02:12:08.384 --> 02:12:09.510
No!

02:12:14.015 --> 02:12:19.395
Then I'll be brief,
o happy dagger!

02:12:20.980 --> 02:12:23.900
This is thy sheath;

02:12:23.983 --> 02:12:27.403
there rest and let me die.

02:12:27.487 --> 02:12:29.405
(moaning)

02:12:47.382 --> 02:12:49.384
(bells tolling)

02:14:17.805 --> 02:14:20.183
Where be these enemies?

02:14:22.810 --> 02:14:24.103
Capulet!

02:14:27.815 --> 02:14:29.192
Montague!

02:14:37.283 --> 02:14:41.287
See what a scourge
is laid upon your hate...

02:14:42.789 --> 02:14:47.919
that heaven finds means
to kill your joys with love;

02:14:48.002 --> 02:14:57.720
and l, for winking
at your discords too,

02:14:57.804 --> 02:15:02.392
have lost
a brace of kinsmen.

02:15:04.811 --> 02:15:07.480
All are punished.

02:15:12.819 --> 02:15:15.196
All are punished!

02:15:46.311 --> 02:15:51.316
A glooming peace
this morning with it brings.

02:15:51.316 --> 02:15:56.779
The sun for sorrow
will not show his head,

02:15:56.779 --> 02:16:00.283
for never was a story
of more woe

02:16:00.283 --> 02:16:05.496
than this of Juliet
and her Romeo.
