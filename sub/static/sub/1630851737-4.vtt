WEBVTT

00:08.958 --> 00:10.458
Cha-chung!

00:39.625 --> 00:41.750
-Oh no.

00:41.833 --> 00:43.458
Here. Here, bebé.

00:45.250 --> 00:47.208
The curse is upon us!

00:47.291 --> 00:49.708
-El Monstruo Blanco!

00:50.708 --> 00:51.791
We are cursed!

00:56.375 --> 00:59.041
Let the jungle decide its fate.

00:59.125 --> 01:02.666
-Run! Before the curse takes us all!

01:17.208 --> 01:18.125
Ah…

01:49.333 --> 01:51.916
-Ah!

02:01.708 --> 02:02.791
Ah!

02:15.000 --> 02:16.708
El Monstruo Blanco!

03:18.916 --> 03:22.708
-Put that childish thing away, mija.

03:22.791 --> 03:23.791
Si, Papa.

03:23.875 --> 03:26.916
My bravest warriors,

03:27.000 --> 03:32.416
the truest of you all
shall become my personal guard

03:32.500 --> 03:36.125
and wield a magical golden bow.

03:39.083 --> 03:42.375
What do you think, my queen?

03:44.250 --> 03:46.791
Yes, yes!

03:48.333 --> 03:49.750
-Huh?

03:58.833 --> 04:01.375
Archer, come forward!

04:01.458 --> 04:05.291
-Your skills are magnificent.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.875
Put your weapons down.

04:14.250 --> 04:18.750
The legend of El Monstruo Blanco is true.

04:18.833 --> 04:24.208
I would like to get a better view
of my new bodyguard.

04:26.041 --> 04:27.583
-Ooh.

04:27.666 --> 04:30.041
Very interesting.

04:30.125 --> 04:33.958
As pale as Lady Micte herself.

04:36.166 --> 04:37.166
Whoa.

04:37.250 --> 04:39.916
Bring the greatest prize of all

04:40.000 --> 04:42.500
-for my greatest warriors.

04:43.375 --> 04:46.500
Oh, yes, a gift from the Tecas,

04:46.583 --> 04:48.541
-a golden magic bow…

04:48.625 --> 04:51.291
…for my new favorite pet.

04:55.208 --> 04:56.958
You filthy animal!

04:57.041 --> 04:59.291
-You dare strike your king?

05:03.166 --> 05:05.958
You! You are a curse!

05:09.666 --> 05:11.000
Brace yourself, Fabiola.

05:11.083 --> 05:15.125
-You insolent, vile creature.

05:16.250 --> 05:20.500
-You have cursed us all, Monstruo Blanco!

05:24.416 --> 05:26.000
Burn it all down!

05:26.083 --> 05:28.833
Papa, don't do this. Por favor.

05:31.541 --> 05:34.083
-Run!

06:34.041 --> 06:36.041
You don't understand. I'm-- I am--

06:36.125 --> 06:38.208
One more word and the cat gets it.

06:49.708 --> 06:51.541
-Oh, oh!

06:53.250 --> 06:54.625
You, muévete.

06:58.208 --> 07:01.625
Hmm.

07:02.208 --> 07:03.958
-Leave the cat here.

07:05.916 --> 07:07.666
My leg is no bueno.

07:07.750 --> 07:09.833
-You want us to chop it off?
-I'm healed!

07:11.750 --> 07:14.125
Oh yeah. This doesn't hurt at all.

07:20.916 --> 07:22.708
Oh. Oh!

07:22.791 --> 07:26.291
That poor little girl
must be terrified of her evil grandpa.

07:26.375 --> 07:31.291
That's the Jungle Lands' king,
and that is his daughter, the Widow Queen.

07:31.375 --> 07:33.250
She looks so sweet.

07:33.333 --> 07:38.333
Yeah? No. They call her that
because all the men around her die.

07:38.416 --> 07:40.083
Dang!

07:47.583 --> 07:50.208
-Beloved Widow Queen of the Jungle Lands…
-Whoa.

07:50.291 --> 07:53.166
…we found these drifters
trying to sneak into our kingdom.

07:53.250 --> 07:54.750
Drifters? I am--

07:54.833 --> 07:58.375
Now why don't you let Rico handle this?
I'm great with little kids.

07:58.458 --> 08:00.041
Listen here, baby girl.

08:00.125 --> 08:03.500
Now, we need to talk
boring grown-up business.

08:03.583 --> 08:08.041
So why don't you tell your mamita
and papito that we're here,

08:08.125 --> 08:10.916
and then go sleepy nappy siesta time?

08:11.000 --> 08:11.833
Oy no.

08:13.166 --> 08:15.208
Guards, feed him to the hyenas.

08:15.291 --> 08:17.708
Yikes! Estefan, help!

08:17.791 --> 08:19.958
-Terebro!

08:20.041 --> 08:23.916
Ah, yeah, um,
which way to the hyenas?

08:24.958 --> 08:27.750
Beloved Queen of the Jungle Lands,

08:27.833 --> 08:31.541
I humbly apologize for not giving
advance notice of our visit.

08:31.625 --> 08:35.458
-Ow!
-And for my insolent partner.

08:35.541 --> 08:37.666
See? I'm insolent until proven guilty.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.750
It is me, Princess Maya of the Tecas.

08:40.833 --> 08:42.458
Stand down, guards.

08:43.625 --> 08:48.291
Now that's what I thought!
It was about to get real crazy in here.

08:48.375 --> 08:51.208
-I'm loco!
-Princess, please state your business.

08:51.291 --> 08:53.958
My father was wrong
about the Teca prophecy.

08:54.041 --> 08:57.083
-But I have figured out its true meaning.

08:57.166 --> 09:00.000
The prophecy I saw was of four warriors,

09:00.083 --> 09:01.541
-one from each kingdom.
-Hm.

09:01.625 --> 09:05.083
I'm the Little Eagle from Teca,
and my friend, Rico,

09:05.166 --> 09:06.708
is the Mighty Rooster Wizard

09:06.791 --> 09:08.208
-from Luna Island.

09:08.708 --> 09:10.916
-Yeah.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.375
We are here seeking the True Skull Warrior
from the Jungle Lands,

09:15.458 --> 09:17.291
Hm? No.

09:19.041 --> 09:21.833
-Would you like some tea?
-Tea, Your Majesty?

09:21.916 --> 09:24.375
It's tea time for me and Fabiola.

09:24.458 --> 09:27.375
Make believe tea party time?
You can't be serious.

09:27.458 --> 09:30.958
-Would you prefer the hyenas?
-I'll take my tea with two lumps.

09:37.625 --> 09:38.666
-Ah!

09:47.458 --> 09:48.750
Princess Maya,

09:48.833 --> 09:52.083
the Jungle Lands weep for your brothers
and the brave warriors of Teca.

09:52.166 --> 09:55.458
You do? Thank you, Your Majesty.

09:55.541 --> 09:58.833
I'm surprised our Jungle Lands
were included in your prophecy.

09:58.916 --> 10:01.958
Our fathers only worked
with their neighboring kingdoms

10:02.041 --> 10:05.333
when it benefited their own self-interest.

10:05.416 --> 10:07.333
Yes, I know.

10:07.416 --> 10:09.750
Kings could often be very shortsighted.

10:09.833 --> 10:11.041
Hmm.

10:11.125 --> 10:14.208
Perhaps this is a chance
to right our fathers' wrongs.

10:15.916 --> 10:16.750
Perhaps.

10:17.583 --> 10:19.083
Mmm!

10:19.166 --> 10:21.375
This té de manzanilla
really hits the spot.

10:21.458 --> 10:22.750
Your cup is empty, wizard.

10:28.125 --> 10:30.500
Yep. Much, much better, Your Majesty.

10:30.583 --> 10:32.166
Aha.

10:32.250 --> 10:33.833
About our quest…

10:34.541 --> 10:35.500
I will help you.

10:36.166 --> 10:38.708
The greatest warrior
in the Jungle Lands is

10:39.625 --> 10:41.000
El Monstruo Blanco.

10:41.083 --> 10:42.750
El Monstruo Blanco?

10:43.333 --> 10:44.958
An unfortunate name

10:45.041 --> 10:47.958
given to her by those
who feared her outward appearance.

10:48.041 --> 10:49.041
Oh.

10:49.125 --> 10:53.083
Thanks to my father,
she now lives as a recluse

10:53.166 --> 10:54.208
in a burnt tree.

10:55.083 --> 10:56.625
No daughter of this kingdom

10:56.708 --> 10:59.875
should be treated as she was,
royal or not.

11:01.708 --> 11:05.958
After my father died,
I sent guards to invite her back.

11:06.041 --> 11:08.875
But she made it very clear
they were not welcome.

11:14.291 --> 11:16.708
-We must speak with her.
-Must we though?

11:16.791 --> 11:18.625
I cannot guarantee your safety.

11:19.250 --> 11:20.625
We'll take our chances.

11:20.708 --> 11:23.583
If you manage to meet with this archer,
please tell her

11:24.083 --> 11:28.416
that I am very sorry for what we did
to her and all of those poor animals.

11:30.250 --> 11:32.125
Your Majesty, you have my word.

11:40.083 --> 11:41.625
Whoa!

11:42.750 --> 11:45.375
We must be getting closer
to Monstruo Blanco.

11:46.041 --> 11:48.250
-Chiapa, trust me,

11:48.333 --> 11:51.166
-there's nothing to be afraid of.

11:51.250 --> 11:52.625
-Ah!

11:52.708 --> 11:55.208
-Chiapa, no!
-This is gonna keep happening with him.

11:55.291 --> 11:57.125
-Look!

11:57.208 --> 11:58.583
-I'm gonna die! Ah!

11:58.666 --> 11:59.583
Thanks, Estefan!

11:59.666 --> 12:02.666
Rico, come on.
That's definitely El Monstruo Blanco.

12:05.375 --> 12:08.041
Okay. This is what we're gonna do.
I'll be the decoy.

12:08.125 --> 12:12.000
You climb into the burnt tree, tackle her,
and take away her bow with Estefan.

12:12.083 --> 12:14.375
-That's your plan?
-You got a better one?

12:14.458 --> 12:17.083
Yeah. It's exactly like yours,

12:17.166 --> 12:19.250
-except we run away!

12:22.000 --> 12:24.833
All right, fearless leader, go decoy away!

12:37.250 --> 12:39.708
She's exactly who I need.

12:39.791 --> 12:43.958
-I can't believe this plan is working.

12:44.041 --> 12:46.166
-Mmm.

12:46.250 --> 12:47.125
Mmm.

12:52.208 --> 12:54.291
-Ah!

12:55.833 --> 12:58.375
It's okay. It's okay. We just wanna talk.

13:00.125 --> 13:01.916
You're a miracle.

13:03.500 --> 13:06.458
-Ooh. Oh! Huevos rancheros!

13:09.625 --> 13:10.458
Ah!

13:12.250 --> 13:14.000
I think we made a mistake.

13:14.083 --> 13:14.916
-Ah!

13:15.000 --> 13:16.541
Great plan.

13:16.625 --> 13:17.500
Shh.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.791
-Before you kill us,

13:21.875 --> 13:23.375
the Widow Queen told us

13:23.458 --> 13:26.833
you're the best warrior
in all the Jungle Lands.

13:28.125 --> 13:32.041
We need you to come with us
to destroy the Divine Gate.

13:38.083 --> 13:40.333
She cannot be
the True Skull Warrior.

13:40.416 --> 13:43.083
-Girl can't even speak.

13:43.166 --> 13:47.416
Why do you wanna destroy the gate?
If you do that, we'll never meet the gods.

13:47.500 --> 13:48.458
Exactly!

13:48.541 --> 13:52.458
Um, fun fact, Lady Micte,
the goddess of death, is her mother.

13:52.541 --> 13:54.250
Yeah, she got some mama issues.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.291
We ain't gonna talk into that,
but by the way, I'm Rico.

13:57.375 --> 13:58.708
-Oh!

13:58.791 --> 14:01.166
Your mother is the goddess of death?

14:01.250 --> 14:03.250
Yes.

14:03.333 --> 14:05.750
My father said this belonged to her.

14:05.833 --> 14:08.291
Talk before I change my mind, human.

14:13.541 --> 14:15.625
The half-breed, where is she?

14:15.708 --> 14:18.041
She managed to escape, my lord.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.541
-And Zatz, where is he?
-Huh?

14:25.833 --> 14:28.750
Zatz and I are no longer together.

14:28.833 --> 14:30.458
No longer together?

14:30.541 --> 14:35.041
-That's not what she asked you, girl.
-I-- I don't know where he is, my lord.

14:35.625 --> 14:39.541
-Hmm. Very well. Hura! Can!
-Your Majesty.

14:40.750 --> 14:42.125
We are at your service.

14:42.875 --> 14:46.125
Capture the half-breed.
Bring her to me alive.

14:46.208 --> 14:47.875
Oh, kill her companions.

14:47.958 --> 14:49.375
-Consider it done.

14:49.458 --> 14:53.750
My lord, my lord, please, allow me
to join them and atone for my failure.

14:53.833 --> 14:56.750
No, no, that won't be necessary, mija.

14:56.833 --> 14:58.958
Please, Lord Mictlan, I beg you.

15:04.291 --> 15:07.750
-You will regret this, you--

15:07.833 --> 15:09.708
Adios, Zatz.

15:32.791 --> 15:34.875
-Ay, ay, ay.

15:38.291 --> 15:42.208
Meaning you're the True Skull Warrior
from the prophecy.

15:44.875 --> 15:46.541
So will you join our quest?

15:46.625 --> 15:50.916
Only if you promise to
introduce me to the goddess of death.

15:51.666 --> 15:53.250
I promise.

15:53.958 --> 15:55.166
I don't trust you.

15:55.750 --> 15:58.291
-You smell like a liar.
-I-- I--

15:58.375 --> 16:00.750
I-- I have no reason to lie.

16:01.875 --> 16:04.625
This'll be an uneasy alliance.
I may decide to kill you later.

16:05.250 --> 16:07.833
You're supposed to say that part
inside your head.

16:07.916 --> 16:10.125
-I'll prepare for the quest.
-Hey, I'll help.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.666
-Move and die, wizard.

16:12.750 --> 16:15.541
Okay. But then again,
this boulder is pretty comfy.

16:22.875 --> 16:26.375
Soon, Lady Micte.
I shall be with you soon.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.041
Ugh. She sure is taking her time.

17:04.208 --> 17:07.958
-Well, well, well, look who's back.
-Where have you been?

17:11.541 --> 17:14.666
-You were on lookout duty?
-Oh yeah, looking out for yourself.

17:14.750 --> 17:16.083
-Hey.

17:16.166 --> 17:17.875
I am ready to quest.

17:21.083 --> 17:21.916
Wow!

17:22.500 --> 17:24.541
-You look spectacular.

17:26.166 --> 17:31.500
Oh… To die by your side would be
such a heavenly way to die.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.458
Skull Warrior, what is your name?

17:45.041 --> 17:45.958
Hm?

17:51.041 --> 17:54.125
Ooh. Ah, do you have a nickname?

17:54.208 --> 17:58.041
Most humans
call me El Monstruo Blanco.

17:58.125 --> 18:02.333
Um… Hmm. Okay-- You know--
Look, maybe, maybe Monsty for short.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.125
But I have always preferred
to be called Chimi.

18:07.916 --> 18:10.541
-Yeah, that'll work.
-Welcome to the prophecy, Chimi.

18:10.625 --> 18:13.875
And you swear to introduce me
to the goddess of death?

18:13.958 --> 18:15.291
This I swear.

18:18.708 --> 18:20.208
-Ah!

18:20.291 --> 18:22.333
Maya and the Two are ready!

18:34.291 --> 18:38.500
As soon as we reach the Golden Mountains,
we must find the Great Puma Warrior.

18:38.583 --> 18:40.291
Then the goddess of death?

18:41.416 --> 18:43.250
Yes, then the goddess of death.

18:43.333 --> 18:47.625
-Wh-- Why do you wanna meet her so bad?
-We're not doing this.

18:47.708 --> 18:49.625
-Okay. Why not?
-Because I hate you.

18:50.208 --> 18:53.041
It usually takes people hours to hate me.

18:53.125 --> 18:56.208
You said I was-- I was a miracle.

18:56.291 --> 18:58.250
-Huh?
-Nothing. Shut up, weirdo.

19:02.291 --> 19:03.541
Oh, I like her.

19:03.625 --> 19:07.166
Whatever your reason
for wanting to meet the goddess of death,

19:07.666 --> 19:10.291
you should know that she ruined my life.

19:10.375 --> 19:12.541
She gave me up when I was born.

19:12.625 --> 19:15.250
My father and his wife, my true mother,

19:15.333 --> 19:17.125
they raised me. It was awful.

19:18.333 --> 19:20.541
-So, you're a princess…

19:20.625 --> 19:23.083
…you live in a palace,
you have two mothers,

19:23.166 --> 19:25.416
one who's a queen and one who's a goddess?

19:25.500 --> 19:28.916
-She has a point.
-But my mother is a monstruo.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.291
Huh?

19:30.375 --> 19:32.250
-Ooh!
-I'm s-- I didn't mean--

19:32.333 --> 19:33.250
Enough.

19:33.333 --> 19:35.833
Before you start complaining
about what you don't have,

19:35.916 --> 19:37.500
be thankful for what you do have.

19:39.083 --> 19:43.208
It's getting late. And I'm hungry.
I'm gonna find some food, princesa.

19:45.500 --> 19:48.291
Huh. I think I really like her.

19:48.375 --> 19:50.416
Yeah, me too. I'll go help.

19:50.500 --> 19:53.875
Take Chiapa and stay together.
I'll go find wood for the campfire.

19:53.958 --> 19:56.458
-Onward!

20:05.125 --> 20:07.125
-Good evening, Princess Maya.

20:07.208 --> 20:09.916
I'm sorry I scared you.
Here. You dropped this.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.458
What do you want?

20:11.541 --> 20:14.208
I was never going to present you
to Lord Mictlan.

20:14.291 --> 20:16.375
I was going to take you home
to meet my father.

20:16.458 --> 20:18.000
You were? Why?

20:18.083 --> 20:21.125
So he could sacrifice you
and overthrow the god of war.

20:21.208 --> 20:24.750
Why is everyone being
so brutally honest with me today?

20:24.833 --> 20:29.750
No. We no longer want to sacrifice you.
I believe you're right about the prophecy.

20:29.833 --> 20:32.250
I believe you can defeat Lord Mictlan.

20:32.333 --> 20:34.291
With our help, of course.

20:34.375 --> 20:35.458
-How did you--
-Oh yes.

20:35.541 --> 20:38.666
I know your real plan
is to kill that monster.

20:38.750 --> 20:41.541
-Join forces with us.
-Join forces?

20:41.625 --> 20:45.458
First you wanna kill me,
then you send your girlfriend after me.

20:45.541 --> 20:47.875
Hmm. Ex-- Ex-girlfriend. Hmm.

20:47.958 --> 20:49.958
-We broke up.
-You did?

20:50.041 --> 20:53.750
I mean, whatever. I'll never join forces
with the likes of you.

20:53.833 --> 20:56.458
-Why not?
-I can't trust you.

20:57.875 --> 21:00.125
You're right. Trust must be earned.

21:00.208 --> 21:02.750
-R-- Right.
-You all must stay vigilant.

21:02.833 --> 21:05.041
Lord Mictlan has sent
two more gods after you.

21:05.125 --> 21:09.458
Uh-ba-ba-ba-ba. I do not need your help,
you teller of lies.

21:09.541 --> 21:13.541
-You serpent tongue. You bat hombre.

21:14.208 --> 21:15.583
Be well, Princess Maya.

21:16.416 --> 21:17.875
-I'll see you soon.

21:17.958 --> 21:19.166
What-- You--

21:19.250 --> 21:20.750
Show-off.

21:22.625 --> 21:26.666
The Golden Mountains Kingdom
should be on that side of the valley.

21:29.458 --> 21:33.000
Fun fact, this has been the site
of countless brutal battles.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.791
I don't think you get how fun facts work.

21:36.791 --> 21:41.125
-I am Hura, the god of storms!

21:41.208 --> 21:42.250
Rah!

21:50.125 --> 21:53.250
-I don't know what he said.
-He said he's Can, the god of wind.

21:54.541 --> 21:56.291
Oh.

21:56.375 --> 22:00.041
-Zatz was telling the truth. Ah!
-Acat was a mere child.

22:00.625 --> 22:03.583
It is time you face some real gods.

22:06.750 --> 22:08.083
Ah!

22:09.208 --> 22:11.500
-Hey there.

22:12.166 --> 22:16.875
-Chiapa! You can't keep running away!

22:16.958 --> 22:17.916
Humans.

22:19.541 --> 22:23.083
Let's take them
for a spin, bro.

22:25.500 --> 22:28.125
Twin wind of terror!

22:29.166 --> 22:30.666
-Ah!

22:32.708 --> 22:34.125
Run away faster, Chiapa!

22:37.708 --> 22:40.000
Back so soon, mocosos?

22:40.625 --> 22:42.958
-Chiapa, do not run.

22:43.041 --> 22:45.208
-You can't keep running away!

22:50.666 --> 22:52.583
Ah… I like that.

22:52.666 --> 22:55.791
Maybe we should sacrifice her
for ourselves.

23:03.125 --> 23:05.333
What? I guess she speaks jaguar.

23:05.416 --> 23:07.125
Change of plan, mocosos.

23:07.708 --> 23:10.541
We are going to kill the princesa.

23:10.625 --> 23:13.000
-Talk is cheap, you brutes!

23:20.291 --> 23:22.791
-Ah!

23:22.875 --> 23:26.000
-I don't know what you told him.
-Welcome back, Chiapa.

23:27.958 --> 23:32.000
-Ah, humans… …so cute.

23:32.083 --> 23:33.916
And so stupid.

23:47.333 --> 23:50.583
-We have to work together!

23:50.666 --> 23:51.708
-Ah!

23:51.791 --> 23:54.833
I fight alone!

23:58.458 --> 23:59.416
How dare you?

23:59.500 --> 24:01.916
-You're going down.

24:03.041 --> 24:04.166
Chimi!

24:05.875 --> 24:06.875
Boulder,

24:07.625 --> 24:09.541
tree, pavo!

24:11.041 --> 24:13.875
-We are the prophecy!

24:16.166 --> 24:17.833
Hold on, Estefan!

24:22.083 --> 24:24.416
-Ah!

24:24.500 --> 24:25.416
Rico!

24:29.958 --> 24:33.000
I'll kill the girl. Bro, you kill the boy.

24:42.625 --> 24:45.041
Oh, El Monstruo Blanco.

24:49.291 --> 24:51.666
Let's get rid of it first.

24:58.541 --> 24:59.833
Help her, Rico.

24:59.916 --> 25:04.333
Magic shield, protéjala.
Shelter her y cuídala.

25:07.000 --> 25:07.833
Huh?

25:07.916 --> 25:08.875
Yes, yes!

25:08.958 --> 25:10.666
Yes, keep going, hermano.

25:16.083 --> 25:17.958
-He's a wizard, bro.

25:18.041 --> 25:19.000
I hate wizards.

25:21.583 --> 25:23.708
Nobody messes with mi familia.

25:23.791 --> 25:26.208
And nobody messes with mine!

25:29.666 --> 25:31.000
-Huh?

25:39.208 --> 25:40.791
-Ah!

25:46.291 --> 25:47.291
Get him, Chiapa!

26:00.791 --> 26:02.750
They fight for me.

26:03.250 --> 26:05.416
You can't keep this up, half-breed.

26:05.500 --> 26:07.041
-Rico, don't stop.

26:07.125 --> 26:09.166
-Die, wizard!

26:10.250 --> 26:12.083
-Rico!

26:20.833 --> 26:23.000
Playtime is over, mocosos.

26:23.083 --> 26:24.125
-Oh!

26:24.208 --> 26:26.541
-Leave me. You've done enough.

26:26.625 --> 26:27.833
Save yourselves.

26:41.208 --> 26:42.500
-What?!

26:45.791 --> 26:47.458
-Huh?

26:59.416 --> 27:00.750
Almost there.

27:03.291 --> 27:05.666
-I'm not dead?
-Good job, wizard.

27:13.541 --> 27:15.333
We do this together!

27:15.416 --> 27:17.041
-Hey, mocosos,

27:17.125 --> 27:19.541
it takes two to make things go right.

27:19.625 --> 27:22.250
It takes two to make it out of sight!

27:25.625 --> 27:29.000
God twin powers activate!

27:30.250 --> 27:33.750
It's the end of the line
for all of you chamacos.

27:44.041 --> 27:46.416
There's no getting out now, half-breed.

27:49.250 --> 27:50.958
I have a plan.

27:51.041 --> 27:53.166
How many arrows do you have left?

27:53.250 --> 27:54.083
One.

27:54.833 --> 27:57.083
-Then we make it count.

27:58.458 --> 28:00.000
-Tighten it up, bro.

28:08.291 --> 28:10.166
I'm not letting you go, Chimi!

28:14.708 --> 28:16.625
-We got you, Maya.

28:19.625 --> 28:22.166
Throw your weapon up as hard as you can.

28:22.250 --> 28:24.083
-What?
-Trust me.

28:28.833 --> 28:30.958
Whatever you're trying to do, do it now.

28:46.625 --> 28:49.583
-Ooh!

28:51.000 --> 28:52.583
-Ah!

29:02.333 --> 29:04.291
-Rico?

29:04.916 --> 29:06.000
Maya?

29:22.166 --> 29:23.791
Chiapa!

29:32.250 --> 29:34.333
-Thank you, my beau-- Whoa!
-We should go.

29:34.416 --> 29:35.333
On a soulful walk?

29:36.625 --> 29:39.291
-To the Golden Mountains Kingdom.
-Ah, yeah.

29:39.375 --> 29:41.416
-Hm.

29:41.500 --> 29:43.916
-Follow me.
-She's walking in the wrong direction.

29:44.000 --> 29:44.833
-Again.

29:44.916 --> 29:47.125
That was a test. You both passed.

29:47.625 --> 29:48.541
Mm-hmm.

29:48.625 --> 29:51.583
-Just say it. You need us.
-Say it.

29:51.666 --> 29:54.333
-The truth is I need you guys.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.333
-Okay. Don't make this weird.
-Too late.

29:57.416 --> 30:00.375
-Maya and the Two are ready!

30:12.541 --> 30:15.958
-Yeah!

30:16.041 --> 30:17.875
One more warrior to go.

30:30.541 --> 30:31.916
-Hola!

30:32.000 --> 30:32.916
Barbarian King?

30:33.750 --> 30:35.541
Barbarian princesa!

30:36.041 --> 30:39.666
So this is
the Golden Mountains Kingdom palace.

30:44.166 --> 30:46.166
-Where is everybody?

30:46.250 --> 30:49.000
-Snake! I hate snakes!

30:49.083 --> 30:51.083
-Careful. Do not touch anything.

30:52.958 --> 30:55.125
-Rico.

30:55.208 --> 30:56.125
I'm sorry!

30:56.208 --> 30:58.458
-I didn't mean to! Oh!

31:00.500 --> 31:01.791
Ah!

31:02.375 --> 31:04.333
-Whoa!

31:05.541 --> 31:06.500
Whoa!

31:10.000 --> 31:12.041
-Whoa!
