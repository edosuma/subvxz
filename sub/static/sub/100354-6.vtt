1:23:55.230 --> 1:23:57.766
Oh, that looks great.

1:23:57.766 --> 1:23:58.967
‐ Oh.

1:23:58.967 --> 1:24:00.802
‐ You really like it, huh?
‐ Mmm, wow.

1:24:00.802 --> 1:24:01.303
Mmm.

1:24:01.303 --> 1:24:02.971
<i>‐ Peter ate a bunch of meat,</i>

1:24:02.971 --> 1:24:05.073
and I was just
so happy for him,

1:24:05.073 --> 1:24:07.943
'cause he loves meat so much.

1:24:07.943 --> 1:24:11.146
‐ [speaking Spanish]

1:24:11.146 --> 1:24:13.215
‐ You're gonna eat it
off the bone?

1:24:13.215 --> 1:24:14.449
You're a carnivore.

1:24:14.449 --> 1:24:16.051
‐ I'm about to have
the meat sweats later.

1:24:16.051 --> 1:24:18.253
‐ [laughs]
You really will.

1:24:18.253 --> 1:24:19.354
Now he has the meat sweats,

1:24:19.354 --> 1:24:22.891
<i>um, which sounds</i>
<i>kind of gross.</i>

1:24:22.891 --> 1:24:23.926
‐ Mmm!

1:24:23.926 --> 1:24:25.127
‐ [laughing]
Oh, my God.

1:24:25.127 --> 1:24:26.128
<i>I'm a vegetarian,</i>

1:24:26.128 --> 1:24:27.996
so I couldn't eat any of it.

1:24:27.996 --> 1:24:29.131
‐ Oh, my God.
It's so juicy.

1:24:29.131 --> 1:24:30.232
‐ Is it really good?

1:24:30.232 --> 1:24:32.334
But I would eat meat
for Peter one time.

1:24:32.334 --> 1:24:33.969
Not more than once, though.

1:24:33.969 --> 1:24:35.771
He loves it.
‐ Mmm.
