WEBVTT

00:00.667 --> 00:01.876
Well, family, I've been mulling

00:01.877 --> 00:03.506
it over for 15 years now,

00:03.507 --> 00:05.546
and I've decided
today is the day,

00:05.547 --> 00:07.086
the Greens are
getting smartphones!

00:07.087 --> 00:08.256
- Whoa-ho!
- What?!

00:08.257 --> 00:09.756
Does this mean we're rich?

00:09.757 --> 00:11.006
We are rich in... love.

00:11.007 --> 00:12.506
And also there's a sale.

00:12.507 --> 00:14.126
That's right!
Big Tech's new Fun Fons

00:14.127 --> 00:15.876
are perfect for families.

00:15.877 --> 00:18.046
These phones are
practically indestructible!

00:18.047 --> 00:19.047
Lookin' at you, kid.

00:19.048 --> 00:21.166
- [thunk]
- Ha!

00:21.167 --> 00:23.416
Wowee! A phone for Tilly!

00:23.417 --> 00:25.626
[female voice]
Hello, Tyler. I am Agatha.

00:25.627 --> 00:27.126
How are you doing today?

00:27.127 --> 00:28.626
Well, I'm doing just fine.

00:28.627 --> 00:30.836
But I'm more worried
about you, Agatha.

00:30.837 --> 00:33.626
How do you fit
in such a tiny device?

00:33.627 --> 00:36.416
[gasps] Your essence is
imprisoned within this phone.

00:36.417 --> 00:39.706
The temperature
outside is 72 degrees.

00:39.707 --> 00:40.756
Don't worry, Agatha.

00:40.757 --> 00:42.876
I promise I will free you!

00:42.877 --> 00:45.126
Now what can old Cricket
get up to with this?

00:45.127 --> 00:46.256
Ha ha! I know!

00:46.257 --> 00:48.046
- [phone rings]
- Hello?

00:48.047 --> 00:50.006
Hello! My name is Bill Green,

00:50.007 --> 00:52.706
uh... Burgshire!
Heh heh, yeah.

00:52.707 --> 00:55.086
And I would like
to order 91 lattes

00:55.087 --> 00:58.126
delivered to 123 Stinky Street.

00:58.127 --> 00:59.706
Wait a minute, is this Cricket?

00:59.707 --> 01:00.707
[Cricket]
Okay, thank you, goodbye!

01:00.708 --> 01:02.706
Ha ha! Got her good.

01:02.707 --> 01:04.256
[Bill] Wow, look
at all these li'l buttons.

01:04.257 --> 01:06.206
- [ringing]
- Ooh, my first phone call!

01:06.207 --> 01:07.706
- [beep]
- Hello?

01:07.707 --> 01:09.006
[on speakerphone]
Hey, Mr. Green?

01:09.007 --> 01:10.796
This is Jerry down
at the autobody.

01:10.797 --> 01:12.836
Heh, speakerphone.

01:12.837 --> 01:14.876
I'm just callin' to let
you know your car's ready.

01:14.877 --> 01:16.086
You know,
the one your mom crashed?

01:16.087 --> 01:17.796
What's this now?

01:17.797 --> 01:19.546
Yeah, it's actually
been ready for a while.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.166
This is like the tenth time
I've called you.

01:21.167 --> 01:23.756
Okay, yes!
Have a lovely day, bye!

01:23.757 --> 01:25.586
Heh heh, spam calls, right?

01:25.587 --> 01:27.206
Bill Green, how could you?!

01:27.207 --> 01:29.706
I went to all that trouble
to get my license back,

01:29.707 --> 01:32.876
and now I find out you've
been keeping my car from me?

01:32.877 --> 01:35.836
It's just... I still don't
know if I'm comfortable
with you driving.

01:35.837 --> 01:38.086
Fool's words!
I'm an excellent driver!

01:38.087 --> 01:39.506
Oh! Well,
if that's true,

01:39.507 --> 01:40.836
you should drive for Swyft!

01:40.837 --> 01:43.336
- Swyft? Whazzat?
- It's this!

01:43.337 --> 01:45.796
Swyft is a smartphone app
where you can make money

01:45.797 --> 01:47.966
by driving folks around,
and if you do well,

01:47.967 --> 01:50.376
they'll leave you
a five-star rating!

01:50.377 --> 01:51.876
I will do exactly that!

01:51.877 --> 01:54.086
Get ready to eat
your words, Billy boy.

01:54.087 --> 01:56.916
I'm off to prove
that I am an excellent driver.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.796
- Uh, wait, hey!
- Jerry here!

01:58.797 --> 02:01.256
Just letting you know you never
actually hung up the phone.

02:01.257 --> 02:03.006
'Kay, thank you, Jerry!

02:03.007 --> 02:04.047
[engine starts]

02:06.167 --> 02:08.376
Ahhh... good
to have you back.

02:08.377 --> 02:10.586
Now just gotta
sign up for Swyft.

02:10.587 --> 02:12.416
- Hey, look at that.
- [chime]

02:12.417 --> 02:14.796
Five stars, here I come.

02:14.797 --> 02:17.796
Uh-huh, yeah.
Okay, my ride just got here.

02:17.797 --> 02:19.206
Yeah, be there soon.

02:19.207 --> 02:21.876
Oh. Actually, my driver's
this little old lady.

02:21.877 --> 02:22.837
I'm gonna be late.

02:22.838 --> 02:24.257
We'll see about that.

02:25.627 --> 02:26.667
I, uh... Aaah!

02:28.587 --> 02:31.666
Aah! Ohh! Aaah!

02:31.667 --> 02:32.876
You need a mint or anything?

02:32.877 --> 02:34.836
I got, uh,
wintergreen or cinnamon.

02:34.837 --> 02:35.837
- Aaaah!
- What's wrong?

02:35.838 --> 02:37.206
Did I miss a turn?

02:37.207 --> 02:39.876
Yeah, these guys
think they own the road.

02:39.877 --> 02:41.376
- [whimpering]
- So how long you
been in Big City?

02:41.377 --> 02:44.007
- [screaming]
- Heh heh, yeah, I hear that.

02:45.627 --> 02:47.206
- Aah! [panting]
- Have a good day!

02:47.207 --> 02:49.836
And don't forget
to gimme five stars!

02:49.837 --> 02:51.916
[chimes]

02:51.917 --> 02:54.587
- [tires screech]
- Waaah!

02:55.797 --> 02:57.836
- Whoa ho ho ho!
- [chimes]

02:57.837 --> 02:59.757
- Wow.
- [screaming]

03:06.127 --> 03:07.836
Heh, all in a day's work.

03:07.837 --> 03:09.876
[whistling] Hm?

03:09.877 --> 03:11.166
[grunts]

03:11.167 --> 03:14.086
Hey, Gloria, get
any wacky orders today?

03:14.087 --> 03:16.046
Oh, Cricket! Yeah,
a Mr. Greenburgshire called

03:16.047 --> 03:18.466
and asked
for 91 piping hot lattes!

03:18.467 --> 03:19.506
Can you believe it?

03:19.507 --> 03:21.876
Wow, such a big order!

03:21.877 --> 03:23.966
But I gotta go
on my mandatory break now,

03:23.967 --> 03:25.296
so you have to fill it.

03:25.297 --> 03:27.916
Ha! What?!
No, no, that's not what I--

03:27.917 --> 03:29.876
They better be done
when I come back!

03:29.877 --> 03:33.166
91 lattes. Huh.

03:33.167 --> 03:34.666
Not a bad first day.

03:34.667 --> 03:37.046
Now let's see all
those five-star ratings.

03:37.047 --> 03:38.796
What?! One star?!

03:38.797 --> 03:40.126
Was... Was Bill right?

03:40.127 --> 03:41.916
Am I a bad driver?

03:41.917 --> 03:45.296
Rats. Guess it's time
to play by the rules.

03:45.297 --> 03:47.466
- [alarm ringing]
- [both laughing]

03:47.467 --> 03:48.626
Coast is clear.

03:48.627 --> 03:50.506
We can take off these disguises.

03:50.507 --> 03:52.126
Nice crime back there, Bella.

03:52.127 --> 03:54.546
The only thing I love
more than crime is you.

03:54.547 --> 03:56.836
And the only thing
I love more than you, is us.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.046
- [smooching]
- [getaway driver] C'mon, guys!

03:59.047 --> 04:00.836
I'm sick and tired
of being your third wheel,

04:00.837 --> 04:03.626
and literal wheels!
I'm out!

04:03.627 --> 04:04.966
Our getaway got away!

04:04.967 --> 04:07.126
Don't worry, babe,
I called a Swyft.

04:07.127 --> 04:08.876
Ugh, I love your mind.

04:08.877 --> 04:10.206
[Gramma] Pick up
for Bella and Bash?

04:10.207 --> 04:11.796
[Bash] Yeah-huh.

04:11.797 --> 04:13.836
Don't worry, folks,

04:13.837 --> 04:15.756
I'll getcha where ya need to go.

04:15.757 --> 04:17.796
Nice and slow.

04:17.797 --> 04:19.336
- [police sirens]
- Listen, we don't care
how you do it.

04:19.337 --> 04:21.206
- Just get us outta here!
- Drive, lady!

04:21.207 --> 04:23.916
Wha-- Really?
Now you're talkin'!

04:23.917 --> 04:25.206
[Bella and Bash] Whoa!

04:25.207 --> 04:27.086
- Aah!
- Whoo hoo hoo!

04:27.087 --> 04:29.126
- [Bella] This is fun!
- [Bash] Yeah!

04:29.127 --> 04:31.126
- [Bella] Whoo!
- [horns honking]

04:31.127 --> 04:33.296
Ha ha! Yeah!

04:33.297 --> 04:35.046
- Oof!
- Oof!

04:35.047 --> 04:36.966
Huh, not bad, old lady.

04:36.967 --> 04:39.126
You just earned yourself
a five-star rating.

04:39.127 --> 04:40.336
Wow! Thanks!

04:40.337 --> 04:41.966
I knew I was a good driver!

04:41.967 --> 04:44.916
You know, we actually
have a few more errands to run

04:44.917 --> 04:46.836
and plenty of stars to give.

04:46.837 --> 04:49.666
More stars?
Let's get started!

04:49.667 --> 04:51.586
[Tilly]
Still in there, Agatha?

04:51.587 --> 04:53.666
[Agatha] I'm sorry,
Tammy, I didn't get that.

04:53.667 --> 04:56.626
Now, I don't know
how your soul got
trapped in this phone.

04:56.627 --> 04:58.006
But I will break you out!

04:58.007 --> 04:59.086
[inhales deeply]

04:59.087 --> 05:03.256
Yaaaah!

05:03.257 --> 05:07.836
Sorry, Tulip, I couldn't
find anything for "Aaaaah."

05:07.837 --> 05:09.706
Curse you, Big Tech!

05:09.707 --> 05:12.836
Don't worry, Agatha.
I am not giving up on you.

05:12.837 --> 05:14.416
[giggling]

05:14.417 --> 05:17.206
You're looking at
a five-star driver, Billy boy!

05:17.207 --> 05:19.126
Ma! Knock! I don't
have my socks on!

05:19.127 --> 05:20.666
I'm indecent!

05:20.667 --> 05:22.416
How's it feel to be wrong, huh?

05:22.417 --> 05:24.666
It's eating you up
inside, isn't it?

05:24.667 --> 05:25.966
I'm just surprised
you found someone

05:25.967 --> 05:27.666
who puts up
with your crazy driving.

05:27.667 --> 05:29.006
I'll have you know
that my riders

05:29.007 --> 05:30.966
don't just put up
with my driving,

05:30.967 --> 05:31.967
they love it.

05:31.967 --> 05:32.967
- [phone chimes]
- Hm?

05:32.968 --> 05:34.046
Ah, there they are now.

05:34.047 --> 05:36.086
Hey, you should tag along.

05:36.087 --> 05:37.416
Then you can see for yourself

05:37.417 --> 05:39.416
just how good a driver I am.

05:39.417 --> 05:40.756
Fine, maybe I will!

05:40.757 --> 05:42.876
Just let me put
my socks on first.

05:42.877 --> 05:45.506
I don't know how I'm gonna
get you outta there, Agatha.

05:45.507 --> 05:46.876
I've tried everything!

05:46.877 --> 05:50.256
I found six results
for trees in your area.

05:50.257 --> 05:51.666
Don't worry,
I'll figure something out.

05:51.667 --> 05:53.206
[grunts]

05:53.207 --> 05:55.876
Hey, uh, yeah, I'm
tired of using this crane.

05:55.877 --> 05:57.876
Too tired to even
turn off the crane.

05:57.877 --> 06:00.546
Don't touch the crane, 'kay?

06:00.547 --> 06:02.296
Hm. That'll do.

06:02.297 --> 06:05.296
[Cricket]
Almost there. 91!

06:05.297 --> 06:06.966
Finally... done.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.336
Ahhh, what a good break.
How's it going?

06:09.337 --> 06:11.376
Oh, my gosh,
you actually did it.

06:11.377 --> 06:12.916
I mean, time to deliver them!

06:12.917 --> 06:15.706
123 Stinky Street
is 20 blocks away.

06:15.707 --> 06:16.966
What? That's not true!

06:16.967 --> 06:18.416
That's not even a real address!

06:18.417 --> 06:20.206
Oh, it's not?
But how would you know that?

06:20.207 --> 06:22.836
Unless this order
is some sort of prank.

06:22.837 --> 06:25.756
123 Stinky Street, huh?

06:25.757 --> 06:27.586
Great! See you
when it's done!

06:27.587 --> 06:29.466
O-kay.

06:29.467 --> 06:31.506
[alarm ringing]

06:31.507 --> 06:33.756
Got a little dirty,
but we made out clean.

06:33.757 --> 06:35.876
Clean or dirty,
I love you either way.

06:35.877 --> 06:37.256
- Oh, yeah?
- You know I do.

06:37.257 --> 06:38.916
- I know you love dirt.
- I know you know I do.

06:38.917 --> 06:39.877
[both] Ride's here!

06:39.878 --> 06:41.416
All, right, Alice,
let's... go.

06:41.417 --> 06:43.006
Who is this?

06:43.007 --> 06:45.296
Where are my manners?
Bill, Bella, Bash.

06:45.297 --> 06:47.836
Bella, Bash, Bill.
Bash, Bill, Bella.

06:47.837 --> 06:50.006
Ohp! Hey, just
getting a news alert
on my smartphone.

06:50.007 --> 06:52.586
Not sure how to, uh...
Oh, it's playing.

06:52.587 --> 06:54.626
We're getting reports
of two passionate criminals

06:54.627 --> 06:56.166
robbing banks across Big City!

06:56.167 --> 06:57.796
If you see
this double trouble duo,

06:57.797 --> 06:59.706
alert authorities immediately!

06:59.707 --> 07:02.466
Sheesh. Better keep
an eye out for-- [gasps]

07:02.467 --> 07:04.916
Ma, all this time,
you've been driving
around criminals!

07:04.917 --> 07:05.917
Is this true?

07:07.257 --> 07:08.506
[grunts] Hey!

07:08.507 --> 07:09.796
Thanks for the ride!

07:09.797 --> 07:11.336
[grunt] I can't get
the other one out!

07:11.337 --> 07:12.966
We've got no time!
Drive!

07:12.967 --> 07:16.166
Hey! That's my car!
And my son!

07:16.167 --> 07:17.966
Ahhh, what a beautiful day!

07:17.967 --> 07:20.006
And the perfect place
for a lean.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.796
- [crunch]
- Wow! That's no good!

07:22.797 --> 07:24.626
Officer Keys! You gotta
go after those criminals!

07:24.627 --> 07:26.666
They have my son!

07:26.667 --> 07:29.586
Well, gosh I'd love to,
but my driving foot
has a flat!

07:29.587 --> 07:31.086
Then I'll drive.

07:31.087 --> 07:32.166
[screech]

07:32.167 --> 07:33.506
Hey, babe, can I drive?

07:33.507 --> 07:34.876
Sure thing, babe,
take the wheel.

07:34.877 --> 07:36.966
Wow, babe, your hair smells
so nice today.

07:36.967 --> 07:38.836
I'm so uncomfortable!

07:38.837 --> 07:40.206
[police siren]

07:40.207 --> 07:41.876
Ugh, they're gaining on us!

07:41.877 --> 07:43.506
How could I be so dumb?!

07:43.507 --> 07:44.966
I put my son in danger

07:44.967 --> 07:47.626
all because I wanted
a five-star rating!

07:47.627 --> 07:49.876
Look, we've all done
crazy things for stars.

07:49.877 --> 07:52.006
I mean, that's
the only reason I'm a cop!

07:52.007 --> 07:53.837
- Huh?
- Unh!

07:55.797 --> 07:57.626
What a shame.
All out of water bottles.

07:57.627 --> 07:58.876
Maybe we should just pull over.

07:58.877 --> 07:59.916
[both] Shut up!

07:59.917 --> 08:01.626
Come on, old lady,

08:01.627 --> 08:03.586
don't you have anything
besides expired mints?!

08:03.587 --> 08:04.666
Oh!

08:04.667 --> 08:06.547
[laughs] Yah!

08:08.837 --> 08:11.296
- Yaah!
- Aah!

08:11.297 --> 08:13.546
What are you doing?
We're gonna lose 'em!

08:13.547 --> 08:16.046
And you're
headed right toward
the Big City Ramp Museum!

08:16.047 --> 08:18.466
[Officer Keys] Whoa!

08:18.467 --> 08:19.667
Oof!

08:21.587 --> 08:23.087
[wild scream]

08:24.257 --> 08:26.836
[Officer Keys] Whoa!

08:26.837 --> 08:29.046
Time to punch it, babe.
You ready?

08:31.877 --> 08:34.086
[Tilly]
Okay, Agatha, just stay calm.

08:34.087 --> 08:36.706
You'll soon be free
of your phone prison!

08:36.707 --> 08:39.666
I'm sorry, Toolbox,
I didn't quite get that.

08:39.667 --> 08:41.296
Just let me do this for you!

08:41.297 --> 08:44.337
[grunting and gasping]

08:45.547 --> 08:47.966
I can't believe that yet again

08:47.967 --> 08:50.506
my actions
have had consequences!

08:50.507 --> 08:51.546
- [phone ringing]
- Hmm?

08:51.547 --> 08:53.586
Uh-- Uh-- Whoa!

those lattes anymore

09:01.377 --> 09:03.586

09:03.587 --> 09:05.506

09:05.507 --> 09:07.836

09:07.837 --> 09:09.706
[chuckles]

09:09.707 --> 09:11.876
The whole time.

09:11.877 --> 09:13.876

09:13.877 --> 09:15.296
[police siren]

09:15.297 --> 09:16.876
They won't stop!
What are we gonna do?!

09:16.877 --> 09:18.127
- Watch this!
- Whoa!

09:19.207 --> 09:21.047
- Yeah!
- [all screaming]

09:22.467 --> 09:24.836
Welp, today can't get any worse.

09:24.837 --> 09:26.876
Never mind. It can.

09:26.877 --> 09:29.296
Whoa-ohh!

09:29.297 --> 09:32.967
- Agatha, be free!
- Aaah!

09:34.587 --> 09:35.876
Woo-hoo! Oh, my.

09:39.797 --> 09:41.466

09:41.467 --> 09:43.587
Oh, hey, there.
Need a lift?

09:44.967 --> 09:46.546
Bella! Please,
baby, don't leave me!

09:46.547 --> 09:48.706
Bash! We've never been
this far apart!

09:48.707 --> 09:49.916
Remember me!

09:49.917 --> 09:51.796
[straining]

09:51.797 --> 09:55.336
O-kay! I think
it's about time
you two got a room...

09:55.337 --> 09:56.546
in prison.

09:56.547 --> 09:57.916
Oh, hey, Mrs. Green!

09:57.917 --> 09:59.796
Great driving back there!

09:59.797 --> 10:03.086
See, Bill?
A fan of my driving
who's not a criminal!

10:03.087 --> 10:05.546
Actually, make that
two non-criminals.

10:05.547 --> 10:06.916
Aww, really?

10:06.917 --> 10:08.796
Your driving style's
not for everyone.

10:08.797 --> 10:10.666
But it sure saved
my bacon back there.

10:10.667 --> 10:13.666
Excuse me. Does this
extremely wet boy belong to you?

10:13.667 --> 10:14.916
Oh, yep, I'll take that.

10:14.917 --> 10:16.336
Well, whaddya say we head home--

10:16.337 --> 10:17.836
Oh! Tilly, you're here.
