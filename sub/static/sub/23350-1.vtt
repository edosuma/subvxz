00:43.710 --> 00:46.111
<i>Sometimes,
I dream I can fly.</i>

00:49.349 --> 00:53.085
<i>But I'm so exhausted
from flapping my wings</i>

00:53.087 --> 00:55.521
<i>and the higher I soar,
it reminds me</i>

00:55.523 --> 00:58.157
<i>of how little I fit in
with them on the ground.</i>

00:59.759 --> 01:03.228
<i>So I rise and I rise</i>

01:03.230 --> 01:05.330
<i>and I realize that</i>

01:05.331 --> 01:07.166
<i>I don't wanna
fly anymore.</i>

01:09.202 --> 01:10.235
<i>They never knew
what they were</i>

01:10.237 --> 01:12.004
<i>looking up at anyway.</i>

01:22.415 --> 01:24.583
<i>But my mother did.</i>

01:27.188 --> 01:28.787
<i>She always saw me.</i>

01:30.356 --> 01:32.024
<i>I called her muv.</i>

01:33.193 --> 01:35.794
<i>And I loved her
like nothing else.</i>

01:37.263 --> 01:39.098
<i>A living testament
to grace</i>

01:39.100 --> 01:41.533
<i>glamour and Gucci.</i>

01:41.535 --> 01:43.202
<i>She had it all.</i>

01:43.204 --> 01:45.370
<i>A siren in stilettos.</i>

01:45.372 --> 01:47.639
<i>Abandon all hope
any men that fall</i>

01:47.641 --> 01:49.208
<i>under her enchantment.</i>

01:49.210 --> 01:51.577
<i>She is just..</i>

01:51.579 --> 01:53.045
<i>...beyond.</i>

01:53.047 --> 01:54.546
<i>Isn't she a vision?</i>

01:54.548 --> 01:56.949
That dress was to die for.

01:56.951 --> 01:58.817
Well, it should be.

01:58.819 --> 02:01.120
The price tag
nearly killed your father.

02:01.122 --> 02:02.554
He knows the price
of everything

02:02.556 --> 02:05.124
and the value of nothing.

02:05.126 --> 02:07.126
Did you just
come up with that?

02:07.128 --> 02:09.595
No, I stole it
from Oscar wilde.

02:09.597 --> 02:12.898
<i>We'd stay up late dissecting
and gossiping the night away.</i>

02:12.900 --> 02:15.634
<i>I could've stayed
in that parlor forever.</i>

02:15.636 --> 02:18.303
<i>Just me and she.</i>

02:18.305 --> 02:19.538
<i>A circle of two.</i>

02:20.341 --> 02:23.375
<i>Unfortunately,
sometimes we were three.</i>

02:24.811 --> 02:27.179
<i>Daddy downer.</i>

02:27.181 --> 02:30.315
<i>My parents fought
and fought like hell.</i>

02:30.317 --> 02:33.785
<i>I never really knew
what drew them together.</i>

02:33.787 --> 02:35.521
<i>But I was there
that night</i>

02:35.523 --> 02:37.456
<i>when they fell apart.</i>

02:37.458 --> 02:39.324
<i>He headed south</i>

02:39.326 --> 02:40.926
<i>and I stayed with muv</i>

02:40.928 --> 02:43.228
<i>for seven blissful years.</i>

02:44.464 --> 02:46.165
<i>When she left this summer</i>

02:46.167 --> 02:47.766
<i>destination unknown</i>

02:47.768 --> 02:50.502
<i>I was shipped
to daddy's family estate.</i>

02:51.437 --> 02:54.339
<i>And thankfully,
I didn't come alone.</i>

02:55.975 --> 02:57.976
<i>Muv armed me
with an unflinching</i>

02:57.978 --> 03:00.179
<i>sense of style, glamor</i>

03:00.181 --> 03:02.014
<i>and a closet
full of frocks</i>

03:02.016 --> 03:03.215
<i>bangles and beads.</i>

03:03.217 --> 03:05.184
<i>So when she
made her exit</i>

03:05.186 --> 03:08.020
<i>I made them my entrance.</i>

03:08.022 --> 03:10.122
<i>And, let's face it.</i>

03:10.124 --> 03:14.026
<i>Father's old home
could use a little... Wow.</i>

03:23.203 --> 03:25.137
<i>You again?</i>

03:25.139 --> 03:29.107
What am I going
to do with you?

03:32.312 --> 03:33.879
<i>These are just words</i>

03:33.881 --> 03:36.481
<i>and it's always better
to show than to tell.</i>

03:36.483 --> 03:38.217
<i>So buckle up, darlings</i>

03:38.219 --> 03:40.485
<i>because I'm gonna
take you on a little ride</i>

03:40.487 --> 03:43.088
<i>I call my life.</i>

03:50.063 --> 03:51.763
<i>It's time
for school, Billy.</i>

03:53.900 --> 03:55.634
Oh, be with us, Jesus.

03:56.569 --> 03:59.004
And take off
that glitter eyeshadow.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.373
This isn't
"dancing with the stars."

04:01.375 --> 04:02.441
<i>This isn't Connecticut.</i>

04:02.443 --> 04:05.377
<i>You're in
the red states now.</i>

04:05.379 --> 04:08.313
You cannot go to your first
day of school like that.

04:09.048 --> 04:13.385
You sweet, precious woman.

04:13.387 --> 04:16.755
Of course I'm not
going to school like this.

05:03.803 --> 05:04.970
Hi.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.378
So I am Billy bloom.

05:15.415 --> 05:18.083
I just transferred here
from Darien, Connecticut

05:18.085 --> 05:20.752
the hometown
of Chloe sevigny.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.024
Hello!

05:28.127 --> 05:30.495
<i>And I realized for me</i>

05:30.497 --> 05:32.764
<i>it was already over.</i>

05:32.766 --> 05:36.034
That is a fantastic tee
you're wearing.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.102
You gotta...

05:37.104 --> 05:39.471
touch me again
and I'll kick your ass.

05:39.473 --> 05:42.874
You have got quite
a potty mouth on you.

05:43.476 --> 05:44.543
Mm.

05:50.283 --> 05:51.283
Go griffins!

05:51.285 --> 05:53.719
Go griffins!

05:53.721 --> 05:56.355
<i>Welcome, class, to the
beginning of the school year.</i>

06:01.361 --> 06:03.095
I was a hit.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.798
Good gosh almighty.

06:08.134 --> 06:09.768
Told you to change.

06:11.504 --> 06:14.506
<i>I can take you shopping
for blue jeans on my day off</i>

06:14.508 --> 06:16.308
<i>if it's okay
with Mr. bloom.</i>

06:18.878 --> 06:20.946
<i>Blue jeans
weren't gonna save me.</i>

06:22.715 --> 06:25.150
<i>Maybe a ticket
to Mars would.</i>

06:26.085 --> 06:27.486
<i>Or Milan.</i>

06:29.355 --> 06:30.489
<i>Anywhere..</i>

06:31.657 --> 06:33.325
<i>...but here.</i>

06:49.609 --> 06:51.076
You know, son

06:51.078 --> 06:52.878
there's a great saying.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.580
"The nail that sticks out
gets hammered down."

06:55.582 --> 06:56.715
Hmm, yeah.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.283
Well, father

06:58.285 --> 06:59.584
you'd certainly know
an awful lot

06:59.586 --> 07:01.553
about getting hammered.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.021
I'm not the one
with that problem.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.392
<i>I have to leave
this town.</i>

07:07.394 --> 07:10.529
<i>I've been hated
by some people before.</i>

07:10.531 --> 07:12.564
<i>But not by everyone.</i>

07:33.119 --> 07:34.586
Psst.

07:34.588 --> 07:35.987
Hey, Billy.

07:37.256 --> 07:38.290
Hi.

07:46.966 --> 07:48.767
Okay, I just wanted
to let you know

07:48.769 --> 07:50.402
that not everyone
in this school is a dick.

07:50.404 --> 07:52.003
And I think
you're amazing.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.472
<i>I think I just
made a friend</i>

07:53.474 --> 07:56.308
<i>in this vipers' den.
Shit. I missed her name.</i>

07:56.310 --> 07:57.642
...you know? Anyway..

07:57.644 --> 07:59.077
<i>If I can just
catch a break</i>

07:59.079 --> 08:02.113
<i>in her verbal avalanche,
I can ask h.. Hold on.</i>

08:02.115 --> 08:04.349
<i>Did she just say,
"blah, blah, blah?"</i>

08:04.351 --> 08:06.318
Anyway, pretty much
the school is douche soup

08:06.320 --> 08:08.086
and they're all
stewing in it.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.755
- All of them?
- Yeah.

08:10.757 --> 08:12.824
<i>- I'll show you.
- But I don't care.</i>

08:12.826 --> 08:15.026
<i>She's an angel.</i>

08:15.028 --> 08:16.995
<i>Bib oberman
was in a boy band.</i>

08:16.997 --> 08:18.864
- No way!
- Way.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.131
They were called
"in twink."

08:20.133 --> 08:22.501
<i>Would you die or what?</i>

08:22.503 --> 08:23.935
<i>Oh.</i>

08:23.937 --> 08:25.804
<i>And that's
lynnette Franz.</i>

08:25.806 --> 08:27.038
<i>There's nothing
she wouldn't do</i>

08:27.040 --> 08:28.640
<i>to become
homecoming queen.</i>

08:28.642 --> 08:31.142
Including burning her
competition at the stake.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.777
<i>We thought that was
just a metaphor</i>

08:32.779 --> 08:34.712
until we saw her
in the crucible.

08:34.715 --> 08:35.881
She wasn't acting.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.650
- And who's that?
- Oh, sesame blixton.

08:39.653 --> 08:42.554
<i>She's secretly dating
the entire basketball team.</i>

08:42.556 --> 08:44.054
<i>I guess it's better
than the swim team.</i>

08:44.057 --> 08:46.091
Chlorine is such
a turn off.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.660
And that's
Tiffany tarbell.

08:48.662 --> 08:50.228
<i>She's a cutter
for Christ.</i>

08:50.230 --> 08:53.031
<i>Nobody's seen her
forearms since 8th grade.</i>

08:53.033 --> 08:55.567
<i>Second-in-command
on lynnette's god squad.</i>

08:57.136 --> 09:00.405
<i>Big guy right there,
that's Bo-Bo Peterson.</i>

09:00.407 --> 09:02.340
<i>He's a god
on the football field</i>

09:02.342 --> 09:03.542
<i>which is kind of ironic</i>

09:03.544 --> 09:05.644
<i>considering
he's dating the devil.</i>

09:05.646 --> 09:07.245
<i>The kid behind me,
I don't know.</i>

09:07.247 --> 09:09.180
We don't talk to him.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.549
Who is that?

09:10.551 --> 09:12.317
<i>Oh, that's flip Kelly.</i>

09:12.319 --> 09:14.052
There's like a whole
story. You don't know it?

09:14.054 --> 09:16.588
Okay, it was during
the homecoming game

09:16.590 --> 09:17.656
of sophomore year.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.324
The griffins
were down by three

09:19.326 --> 09:21.393
when flip,
aka mark Kelly

09:21.395 --> 09:23.728
executed a spectacular

09:23.730 --> 09:26.064
last minute
quarterback sneak

09:26.066 --> 09:28.700
<i>leaping and jumping
ten feet in the air</i>

09:28.702 --> 09:29.834
<i>over the defensive line</i>

09:29.836 --> 09:32.437
and landing
in the end zone.

09:32.439 --> 09:33.872
Oh, my god.

09:33.874 --> 09:36.174
The whole town needed a
cigarette after that catch.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.876
And after that,
it was "goodbye, mark.."

09:37.878 --> 09:39.744
<i>- Hello, flip.
- Exactly.</i>

09:39.746 --> 09:40.745
<i>But it keeps going.</i>

09:40.747 --> 09:42.180
<i>The whole town
was whipped up</i>

09:42.182 --> 09:44.082
<i>into such a frenzy
that they nominated him</i>

09:44.084 --> 09:45.450
<i>as homecoming king</i>

09:45.452 --> 09:47.285
even though he was
only a sophomore.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.588
So, flip declines
the title

09:49.590 --> 09:51.556
<i>and says it should go
to bib oberman.</i>

09:51.558 --> 09:54.225
<i>Because he said bib was the real
guy who led the team to victory.</i>

09:54.227 --> 09:57.228
I mean, people just
lost their freaking minds.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.563
Because of
what a wonderful

09:58.565 --> 10:00.632
selfless young man
flip Kelly was.

10:00.634 --> 10:01.800
<i>And from that day on</i>

10:01.802 --> 10:03.401
<i>the kid could do
no wrong.</i>

10:40.741 --> 10:42.574
<i>Is it just me</i>

10:42.576 --> 10:45.176
<i>or does he literally move
in slow motion?</i>

11:09.703 --> 11:11.336
I didn't mean
to startle you.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.605
I certainly did not mean
to make that sound.

11:14.607 --> 11:15.674
You're funny.

11:17.443 --> 11:18.677
You're flip.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.347
Well, I just wanted,
uh, to say hi.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.715
Just introduce myself.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.083
Hey, girl.

11:26.952 --> 11:28.553
Hi.

11:28.555 --> 11:29.554
Is that "Dorian gray?"

11:31.824 --> 11:34.459
Well, that's crazy, man.
We're reading' the same book.

11:34.461 --> 11:35.960
<i>I wasn't gonna be
the one to tell him</i>

11:35.962 --> 11:38.496
<i>the entire senior class
was reading it</i>

11:38.498 --> 11:39.698
<i>this semester.</i>

11:41.300 --> 11:43.401
Uh, well, um..

11:43.403 --> 11:45.303
You know, I just..
I'll see you around?

11:45.305 --> 11:47.739
And don't pay attention to
those assholes in biology.

11:47.741 --> 11:49.841
I think you're okay.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.604
What are you
doing over here?

12:20.840 --> 12:23.341
Just wanted to see
how you're acclimating

12:23.343 --> 12:24.709
to the new school.

12:24.711 --> 12:26.845
I'm not
a ficus plant, father.

12:27.747 --> 12:28.813
I don't acclimate.

12:30.783 --> 12:32.951
You know, I remember
how you liked that

12:32.953 --> 12:34.853
thai restaurant
back in Darien.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.888
There's a great place
in town that we can...

12:36.890 --> 12:38.089
I'm really sorry,
I'm in the middle

12:38.091 --> 12:39.357
of something
really important.

12:51.103 --> 12:54.873
<i>Oh, muv,
I miss you terribly.</i>

12:54.875 --> 12:57.575
<i>You haven't answered
any of my messages.</i>

12:57.577 --> 12:59.944
<i>I know I'm only
supposed to be here</i>

12:59.946 --> 13:03.548
<i>for the semester,
and I'm trying to fit in.</i>

13:03.550 --> 13:05.950
<i>But I don't know how much
of me they can take.</i>

13:06.819 --> 13:08.987
<i>Come and get me.</i>

13:08.989 --> 13:11.556
<i>Love, your
withering bloom.</i>

13:12.291 --> 13:13.892
<i>Billy.</i>

13:31.811 --> 13:33.578
<i>Alright, class,
listen up.</i>

13:33.580 --> 13:35.280
<i>Now, your oral
book reports</i>

13:35.282 --> 13:37.615
<i>will be due October 18th.</i>

13:37.617 --> 13:39.918
Girls? Girls.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.519
<i>Break it up.</i>

13:41.521 --> 13:44.255
I've given you
a choice of topics.

13:44.257 --> 13:46.925
"Zelda Fitzgerald,"
"the teapot dome scandal"

13:46.927 --> 13:49.828
and "the picture
of Dorian gray."

13:49.830 --> 13:50.829
<i>Now, there's
plenty of time</i>

13:50.831 --> 13:53.598
between now
and October 18th.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.666
Don't let me down.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.703
Have a great
rest of your day.

13:58.705 --> 14:00.071
Class dismissed.

14:06.545 --> 14:07.612
The ladies who lynch.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.948
- Hi!
- Hey.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.549
It's Billy, right?

14:11.551 --> 14:13.885
Yes, it is indeed.

14:13.887 --> 14:17.155
Well, we just wanted to
come on over and say "hey."

14:17.157 --> 14:18.556
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:18.558 --> 14:21.125
We all might've gotten off
on kind of the wrong foot

14:21.127 --> 14:23.294
seein' as you are,
you know, the new queer.

14:23.296 --> 14:26.064
I mean, um,
i mean... I mean, kid

14:26.066 --> 14:27.465
on the block and all.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.634
Yeah, I guess
you're right.

14:29.636 --> 14:32.237
Just, we're not really used
to people like you around here.

14:32.239 --> 14:35.039
- You mean amazing people?
- No.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.408
I mean, like, boys
who dress like...

14:37.410 --> 14:39.744
- fashion icons?
- No, she means...

14:39.746 --> 14:41.346
legends of the runway?

14:41.348 --> 14:43.248
Girls. She means boys
who dress like girls.

14:43.250 --> 14:46.084
Anyway, don't mind her.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.986
We were actually just
wondering if, you know

14:47.988 --> 14:50.054
you'd like to help us
with our style

14:50.056 --> 14:53.391
seein' as you've got it
all goin' on.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.859
Absolutely,
it'd be my pleasure.

14:54.861 --> 14:55.994
How about
we start right now?

14:55.996 --> 14:58.997
Okay, sesame.
Ditch the sweatpants.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.231
Like lagerfeld said

15:00.233 --> 15:02.600
"it's the ultimate
sign of defeat."

15:02.602 --> 15:04.102
<i>Pretty funny,
isn't it, tiff?</i>

15:04.104 --> 15:06.337
Almost as funny
as those wedges.

15:06.339 --> 15:07.538
<i>What are you trying
to do with those things?</i>

15:07.540 --> 15:10.408
- Kill a family of rats?
- Don't you dare.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.711
One must always dare,
darling.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.914
Or else we'd all end up
looking like you.

15:17.549 --> 15:19.284
Well, this has been fun.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.286
We should do it
again sometime, okay?

15:21.288 --> 15:22.720
<i>Kisses.</i>

15:22.722 --> 15:24.889
<i>I know I just signed
my own death warrant.</i>

15:24.891 --> 15:27.292
<i>But sometimes, you just
gotta dress a bitch down.</i>

16:10.402 --> 16:12.070
What is it
this time, bloom?

16:20.180 --> 16:22.113
I am being

16:22.115 --> 16:23.581
practically terrorized
out there

16:23.583 --> 16:26.584
and you won't lift a fetal
pig's brow to stop it.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.619
Is someone teasing you?

16:28.621 --> 16:31.923
Yes, uh, Bernie, bib

16:31.925 --> 16:33.524
Tiffany, lynnette Franz

16:33.526 --> 16:36.027
all day, every day.

16:36.029 --> 16:38.696
Aren't you being
overly dramatic?

16:38.698 --> 16:40.765
Normally, I would take
that as a compliment

16:40.767 --> 16:43.167
but, no, I'm not,
look at this.

16:44.536 --> 16:46.104
Mr. reamer.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.172
You have to transfer me
out of that class.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.108
Nothing I can do.

16:50.110 --> 16:53.711
So, you're just gonna
sit there and watch

16:53.713 --> 16:55.113
like a good German?

17:09.795 --> 17:12.630
If Mr. reamer won't
transfer me out of biology

17:12.632 --> 17:14.065
I'm gonna get myself
kicked out of biology.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.199
How?

17:15.201 --> 17:17.035
It's Lindsay Lohan
that gets kicked out

17:17.037 --> 17:19.804
of all those four-star hotels
and strip clubs, not Taylor swift.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.472
The pussiest pimple
gets popped.

17:21.473 --> 17:22.507
Okay.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.642
Billy, you're starting
to scare me.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.577
What're you gonna do?

17:26.579 --> 17:28.112
I'm gonna get popping.

17:30.315 --> 17:31.516
What?

17:46.698 --> 17:48.666
<i>Weeks rolled by</i>

17:48.668 --> 17:51.869
<i>as I slalomed through
the daily shitshow</i>

17:51.871 --> 17:54.572
<i>of masticated spitballs.</i>

17:55.407 --> 17:57.341
<i>Total war.</i>

18:05.751 --> 18:07.285
What're you lookin' at,
faggot?

18:10.355 --> 18:12.690
You, Bernard.

18:12.692 --> 18:15.660
The faggot is clearly
looking at you.

18:22.568 --> 18:23.768
<i>The hash-fag.</i>

18:40.953 --> 18:42.820
<i>Life is hard, Billy.</i>

18:42.822 --> 18:45.189
<i>Yes, but it's
beautiful too.</i>

18:54.667 --> 18:55.833
<i>Should we slow down, muv?</i>

18:56.970 --> 18:59.237
Slow down?
Oh-ho-ho.

18:59.239 --> 19:02.206
To slow down would be
a fatal mistake.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.922
<i>Slop on that gunk.</i>

19:17.924 --> 19:20.424
<i>Hide that desperation.</i>

19:20.426 --> 19:21.592
<i>Goal?</i>

19:21.594 --> 19:25.263
<i>To erase Billy bloom
completely.</i>

19:25.265 --> 19:27.698
<i>Let someone else
take over for a while.</i>

19:29.134 --> 19:33.104
<i>When Billy looked around
and saw all he created</i>

19:33.106 --> 19:35.373
<i>he said..</i>

19:35.375 --> 19:36.874
<i>"...it is good."</i>

19:37.609 --> 19:39.443
It is very good.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.635
That's messed up.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.237
What are you doin'?

20:54.621 --> 20:55.953
<i>Are you happy, Billy?</i>

20:55.955 --> 20:59.290
Me?
I've never been happier.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.261
It's hard to be happy
when you're

21:03.263 --> 21:04.962
a chrysanthemum
in a coal mine.

21:04.964 --> 21:05.963
You know what I mean?

21:27.586 --> 21:29.020
Hey! Move!

21:31.390 --> 21:34.825
Listen, I've gotta
prepare you for this world.

21:36.662 --> 21:40.431
<i>The world can be a cold,
hard, humorless place.</i>

21:40.433 --> 21:41.465
No! Move!

21:41.467 --> 21:42.900
That's why..

21:42.902 --> 21:45.469
...you must always
let your fancy roam.

21:49.408 --> 21:53.344
Yeah, I want you to learn
to take a deep breath.

21:53.346 --> 21:55.913
<i>- And if life kicks you..
- Muv.</i>

21:55.915 --> 21:57.648
You just kick harder!

21:57.650 --> 21:59.016
Higher!

21:59.018 --> 22:00.251
Higher!

22:00.253 --> 22:01.419
<i>Higher!</i>

22:01.421 --> 22:02.853
Muv.

22:02.855 --> 22:04.989
Higher! Higher!

22:06.992 --> 22:08.526
Muv.

22:11.363 --> 22:12.963
<i>Mr. bloom.</i>

22:12.965 --> 22:14.932
<i>Hey, Mr. bloom,
I think he's wakin' up.</i>

22:16.668 --> 22:19.503
You're still
in the hospital, son.

22:19.505 --> 22:20.438
You were in a coma

22:20.440 --> 22:22.273
for five days.

22:24.776 --> 22:26.010
Where is muv?

22:26.945 --> 22:28.446
She was just here.

22:28.448 --> 22:30.314
Well, she couldn't
make it, son.

22:30.316 --> 22:32.616
Probably blacked out
in a ditch.

22:32.618 --> 22:35.453
- What did you say?
- Uh, she sends her love.

22:35.455 --> 22:37.788
Welcome back, Billy.

22:37.790 --> 22:40.691
You gave us all
quite a scare there.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.126
How many fingers
am I holding up?

22:42.128 --> 22:43.627
<i>- One.
- Good.</i>

22:43.629 --> 22:46.364
Any blurred vision?
Headaches? Nausea?

22:46.366 --> 22:48.399
All of the above.

22:48.401 --> 22:51.068
Could I get some
lip gloss please?

22:51.070 --> 22:52.470
When can i
take him home, doctor?

22:52.472 --> 22:53.738
In a few days.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.673
Your son has
multiple abrasions

22:55.675 --> 22:57.508
contusions, concussions

22:57.510 --> 22:59.143
organ trauma
and hemorrhaging

22:59.145 --> 23:00.411
that we need
to keep an eye on.

23:00.413 --> 23:03.047
Well, I guess they
didn't like the dress.

23:03.049 --> 23:05.549
<i>Billy is quite
a fighter, Mr. bloom.</i>

23:05.551 --> 23:08.219
The good news is
he is going to mend

23:08.221 --> 23:09.987
with at least
a month of bed rest

23:09.989 --> 23:11.889
and a little
physical therapy.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.858
<i>You will feel quite dizzy
for a while</i>

23:13.860 --> 23:17.428
so just..
You take it easy, okay?

23:17.430 --> 23:18.429
What happened?

23:20.098 --> 23:21.932
Sir, do you mind
if I tell him?

23:21.934 --> 23:23.834
Of course not.

23:23.836 --> 23:27.104
Uh, could you guys,
uh, give us a minute?

23:28.273 --> 23:32.009
I'd... I'd like
to hear this, um, alone.

23:32.011 --> 23:33.844
I'll give you
five minutes, okay?

23:33.846 --> 23:35.613
And check his vitals
and, uh..

23:35.615 --> 23:36.947
<i>...get the boy
some lip gloss.</i>

23:36.949 --> 23:38.416
Hey.

23:38.418 --> 23:40.251
Hi.

23:40.253 --> 23:42.720
You know, you've got
a great dad.

23:42.722 --> 23:45.356
He's been so worried
about you, Billy.

23:45.358 --> 23:48.025
<i>Me too, I've been here
just about everyday.</i>

23:49.127 --> 23:51.862
<i>Most days, anyway, and..</i>

23:51.864 --> 23:54.632
<i>...I've been talking
to you non-stop.</i>

23:54.634 --> 23:56.534
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

23:56.536 --> 23:57.768
No.

24:00.872 --> 24:02.807
I even got you a..

24:02.809 --> 24:04.241
...fashion magazine.

24:04.243 --> 24:05.443
Ooh..

24:05.445 --> 24:07.344
I'll just leave it here,
alright?

24:08.814 --> 24:10.581
<i>So, there were these guys</i>

24:10.583 --> 24:12.416
<i>just texting
shit about you.</i>

24:12.418 --> 24:14.151
And I... I didn't really
think much of it

24:14.153 --> 24:16.587
'cause everyone's been talking
shit about you since you got here.

24:16.589 --> 24:18.055
They have?

24:18.057 --> 24:19.590
<i>Billy, come on.</i>

24:19.592 --> 24:21.459
When you didn't
show up to bio lab

24:21.461 --> 24:23.561
and, and
neither did... did

24:23.563 --> 24:26.230
Tim and sal and those
asshole sophomore jocks..

24:26.232 --> 24:27.665
<i>Uh, look, Billy, I tried.</i>

24:27.667 --> 24:29.500
<i>Like I really,
really tried...</i>

24:29.502 --> 24:31.135
flip..

24:31.137 --> 24:34.104
It's... it's... it's okay.

24:34.106 --> 24:35.573
I am not mad.

24:35.575 --> 24:37.808
I'm grateful.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.543
You saved my life.

24:40.745 --> 24:42.146
<i>Really?</i>

24:42.148 --> 24:45.182
Really, really, really.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.618
Alright, well,
i gotta go, alright?

24:47.620 --> 24:49.019
Where are you going?

24:49.021 --> 24:51.088
Football practice.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.690
You're..
Oh, you're good, buddy.

24:52.692 --> 24:54.859
<i>Doc said you're gonna be
good as new, back to..</i>

24:54.861 --> 24:57.862
<i>Think fast, bloomy.
Think fast.</i>

24:58.931 --> 25:00.664
Doctor!

25:00.666 --> 25:01.765
<i>What happened?</i>

25:01.767 --> 25:03.701
- What happened?
- I... I don't know!

25:16.314 --> 25:17.748
Thank you, flip.

25:22.120 --> 25:24.955
Okay, you're home now.

25:24.957 --> 25:27.124
And I better
get goin', so..

25:27.126 --> 25:28.626
What? No, no, no, no, no.

25:28.628 --> 25:31.161
Stay here,
you just got here.

25:31.163 --> 25:33.564
Yeah, well, I just,
i just figured, you know

25:33.566 --> 25:35.699
you'd want some rest or...
or call, call your friends.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.334
- Or something.
- Relax.

25:37.336 --> 25:39.737
You can't catch
multiple contusions.

25:39.739 --> 25:42.573
Florence will make you
something to eat.

25:42.575 --> 25:44.909
I... I... I just
wanna thank you

25:44.911 --> 25:46.977
for everything
that you've done.

25:46.979 --> 25:48.879
Yeah, you know, Billy,
i appreciate it, i... I do

25:48.881 --> 25:52.516
but, I'm not, I just, i really...
I really better get going.

25:52.518 --> 25:53.584
<i>Bye.</i>

25:57.155 --> 25:58.722
Holy..

26:00.659 --> 26:02.826
You're an expressionist.

26:02.828 --> 26:05.095
Huh, I see.

26:05.097 --> 26:08.232
Well, yeah, I'm not
a total caveman, Billy.

26:08.234 --> 26:10.601
You know, when I saw this,
this was part of an exhibit

26:10.603 --> 26:11.669
at the met in New York.

26:11.671 --> 26:13.170
<i>Yeah, it was on loan.</i>

26:13.172 --> 26:15.272
Daddy likes
to spread the wealth

26:15.274 --> 26:17.875
but not the hugs
and kisses.

26:17.877 --> 26:19.944
I told my dad that

26:19.946 --> 26:22.112
I was gonna go see
a mets game.

26:22.114 --> 26:23.581
And he bought it.

26:27.953 --> 26:29.620
Oh, were these
the extra glitter?

26:29.622 --> 26:31.522
- I love it.
- You like it?

26:31.524 --> 26:33.424
Okay, so, I have
to tell you about school

26:33.426 --> 26:34.758
because, literally

26:34.760 --> 26:37.561
literally everybody
is talking about you.

26:37.563 --> 26:39.196
And you are a hero.

26:39.198 --> 26:41.098
You are a martyr
to the cause.

26:41.100 --> 26:44.034
They had an assembly at
school about hate crimes.

26:44.036 --> 26:46.604
And a sensitivity speaker
was brought in

26:46.606 --> 26:47.705
and she talked
about tolerance.

26:47.707 --> 26:48.739
She showed a movie
and everythin'.

26:48.741 --> 26:50.941
A movie? Yeah, well,
that'll show 'em.

26:50.943 --> 26:53.978
No, all those guys who beat
you up, they got expelled.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.746
On the spot.
Just like that.

26:55.748 --> 26:58.782
The school now has
a zero-tolerance policy

26:58.784 --> 27:00.384
on all hate crimes.

27:00.386 --> 27:02.219
And it's because of you,
really, it is.

27:02.221 --> 27:04.888
Well, whatever I can do,
i will do.

27:04.890 --> 27:08.459
Okay, so, flip Kelly beat
the crap out of Bernie

27:08.461 --> 27:10.160
the day after
you were attacked

27:10.162 --> 27:13.497
because he was laughing about
how you'd gotten your ass kicked.

27:13.499 --> 27:14.965
And lynnette Franz!

27:14.967 --> 27:17.434
She broke up
with Bo-Bo Peterson.

27:17.436 --> 27:19.069
But nobody knows why.

27:19.071 --> 27:21.972
Okay, did you hear
about sesame blixton?

27:21.974 --> 27:24.174
No, but tell me
or I'll die.

27:24.176 --> 27:27.911
Okay. She got a boob job.
Monster snoobs.

27:27.913 --> 27:29.780
As a 17th
birthday present

27:29.782 --> 27:31.749
from her dad!

27:32.784 --> 27:35.486
Right? I know!
Why! Ah!

27:35.488 --> 27:38.789
Apparently, she got the boob
job to get flip's attention

27:38.791 --> 27:41.358
because she wants
to ask him to homecoming.

27:43.461 --> 27:45.129
<i>So how's he doin', ma'am?</i>

27:45.131 --> 27:46.463
A little tired but..

27:46.465 --> 27:48.799
- Well, look who's back.
- Hey, Billy.

27:48.801 --> 27:51.101
Actually, I, uh, gotta go.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.971
- Feel better, Billy.
- Okay.

27:53.973 --> 27:57.675
<i>Come on, uh, honey,
I'll show you out.</i>

27:57.677 --> 27:58.909
<i>Hey!</i>

28:02.881 --> 28:04.314
What'd you say
your name was?

28:04.316 --> 28:05.783
What's her name again?

28:05.785 --> 28:06.950
I have no idea.

28:10.155 --> 28:11.689
She's my
very best friend.

28:11.691 --> 28:14.792
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
i thought I was. Hmm?

28:14.794 --> 28:17.294
Who's been comin'
over here everyday

28:17.296 --> 28:19.630
like he said he would?

28:19.632 --> 28:21.498
<i>- You have.
- Hmm.</i>

28:21.500 --> 28:24.301
But, you spend
all your time

28:24.303 --> 28:25.502
in the drawing room

28:25.504 --> 28:27.237
<i>or talking
about fly fishing</i>

28:27.239 --> 28:28.539
<i>with my father, so..</i>

28:28.541 --> 28:30.641
I know, I love it!

28:30.643 --> 28:32.576
I can't believe
the dude hates football.

28:32.578 --> 28:34.712
It's the only thing
we have in common.

28:35.847 --> 28:37.915
Do you hate football?

28:37.917 --> 28:38.982
What?

28:40.251 --> 28:42.553
<i>No.
Who could hate football?</i>

28:42.555 --> 28:43.721
Well, except you two.

28:45.990 --> 28:46.990
I don't know,
i just don't love it

28:46.992 --> 28:48.892
as much as everyone
thinks I do.

28:50.228 --> 28:52.730
You're leaving skid marks
on daddy's new runner.

28:52.732 --> 28:54.832
He's gonna freak out
when he sees the mess

28:54.834 --> 28:58.035
that you have made,
young man.

28:58.037 --> 29:00.504
What's that
goddamned noise?

29:00.506 --> 29:03.540
Oh, ha-ha, flip!
Here.

29:03.542 --> 29:04.842
- Hey.
- Hey!

29:04.844 --> 29:06.944
- Let me give you a hand with that.
- Oh, thank you.

29:06.946 --> 29:08.545
That "that" is your son.

29:08.547 --> 29:09.747
<i>How're you doin',
Mr. bloom?</i>

29:09.749 --> 29:12.516
<i>Even daddy
is under flip's spell.</i>

29:12.518 --> 29:14.551
<i>Here's what
he was hoping.</i>

29:14.553 --> 29:17.521
<i>That somehow
just my sheer proximity</i>

29:17.523 --> 29:19.022
<i>to a manly man like flip</i>

29:19.024 --> 29:20.758
<i>will knock
the sissy out of me</i>

29:20.760 --> 29:22.893
<i>and maybe then,
I'll gut fish</i>

29:22.895 --> 29:24.528
<i>and give him
grandchildren.</i>

29:24.530 --> 29:27.431
- Florence! Uh!
- Oh!

29:27.433 --> 29:29.733
<i>Apparently, Florence is
the only one in the house</i>

29:29.735 --> 29:31.268
<i>immune to flip's charm.</i>

29:31.270 --> 29:33.470
Why don't you make these
boys some of that delicious

29:33.472 --> 29:35.706
Virginia fried chicken
of yours?

29:35.708 --> 29:37.374
What fried chick..

29:38.443 --> 29:40.410
Why not?

29:40.412 --> 29:43.413
<i>- What is that?
- That is a broiled grapefruit.</i>

29:43.415 --> 29:45.282
<i>And it's not gonna
kill you, I promise.</i>

29:45.284 --> 29:46.884
Honestly, Billy, I think
I'd just rather have

29:46.886 --> 29:48.886
a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

29:48.888 --> 29:52.055
<i>Oh! No way!
Hey, Mr. bloom!</i>

29:52.057 --> 29:55.759
Hey, flip! How about a little
doodle socking tomorrow after school?

29:55.761 --> 29:57.127
Oh, you got it!

29:57.129 --> 29:59.296
- We're on!
- Alright, I'll see you later.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.566
I hope that's a fish.

30:02.568 --> 30:04.168
It's actually
a style of fishing.

30:05.003 --> 30:06.904
You got the best dad.

30:06.906 --> 30:08.605
Yeah..

30:08.607 --> 30:10.407
...if you're you.

30:10.409 --> 30:13.977
But this is the most that I've seen
or talked to the man in seven years.

30:13.979 --> 30:15.746
He turned on me
when I was ten years old

30:15.748 --> 30:18.348
the first time I sashayed
across his marble floor

30:18.350 --> 30:21.518
in his wife's
satin slingbacks.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.053
Daddy never recovered.

30:24.923 --> 30:27.591
- That's a shoe, right?
- A-plus.

30:27.593 --> 30:30.961
Okay. Okay. Okay.

30:30.963 --> 30:32.429
It was very traumatic.

30:32.431 --> 30:35.432
I was exiled from
the family after that.

30:35.434 --> 30:39.136
No more regattas.
No more barbecues.

30:39.138 --> 30:42.005
My life as a bloom
had officially ended.

30:43.875 --> 30:46.543
So, are you gonna eat that
broiled grapefruit or what?

30:46.545 --> 30:50.314
Dude, you got it so good.
You've no idea.

30:50.316 --> 30:52.683
I'm so sorry,
what is so good about it?

30:52.685 --> 30:53.851
Everything.

30:53.853 --> 30:56.887
You can dress
however the hell you like.

30:56.889 --> 30:59.523
You can dye your hair
orange or pink.

30:59.525 --> 31:01.959
Sleep till noon.
No one gives a shit.

31:01.961 --> 31:03.961
Yeah, but that's because
no one gives a shit.

31:03.963 --> 31:05.495
Yeah, you wanna
hear about my dad?

31:05.497 --> 31:06.964
I was eight.

31:06.966 --> 31:09.199
I skipped out
on pop Warner.

31:09.201 --> 31:10.901
I wanted to go
to the comic book store.

31:12.170 --> 31:13.971
My dad found me there.

31:13.973 --> 31:16.874
I've never seen him
so pissed.

31:16.876 --> 31:17.975
In front
of all my friends

31:17.977 --> 31:19.877
he pulled down my pants
and beat me raw.

31:19.879 --> 31:21.178
Oh.

31:21.180 --> 31:22.813
I couldn't sit down
for a week.

31:22.815 --> 31:25.582
- That's terrible.
- It gets worse.

31:25.584 --> 31:28.085
He made me burn
all my comics.

31:28.087 --> 31:29.353
Every single one of them
and, dude

31:29.355 --> 31:32.623
I had this
amazing spider-man #252.

31:34.058 --> 31:35.392
That would be worth
bank right now.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.661
What a prick.

31:37.663 --> 31:40.564
"Man is many things,
but he is not rational."

31:40.566 --> 31:42.566
- Oscar wilde.
- Mm-hmm.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.768
- Mm-hmm.
- I love that line.

31:47.038 --> 31:48.805
What would you do if you
didn't play football?

31:50.174 --> 31:51.608
Don't laugh.

31:52.710 --> 31:54.344
Who could I laugh at?

31:56.547 --> 31:58.115
I'd be an artist.

31:59.017 --> 32:00.550
I knew it.

32:00.552 --> 32:02.019
<i>How could you?</i>

32:02.021 --> 32:05.088
I have a gift
for the obvious.

32:05.090 --> 32:06.757
Besides, you were
practically drooling

32:06.759 --> 32:09.693
over daddy's
Jackson pollock.

32:09.695 --> 32:11.361
I think you like football

32:11.363 --> 32:13.830
as much as I like
eating with my fingers.

32:15.433 --> 32:17.034
Alright, is it
time for you

32:17.036 --> 32:18.936
to roll around
the backyard?

32:18.938 --> 32:20.904
Twice a day.
Let's do it. Come on.

33:04.315 --> 33:06.350
<i>On your right
is the historic home</i>

33:06.352 --> 33:08.085
<i>of the bloom family.</i>

33:08.087 --> 33:11.688
<i>They are one of the
city's founding families.</i>

33:13.625 --> 33:15.692
<i>Now, that's a naughty monkey.</i>

33:24.802 --> 33:26.970
Welcome to the jungle,
baby.

33:26.972 --> 33:28.171
You need to eat.

33:29.207 --> 33:30.741
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

34:28.166 --> 34:31.168
I didn't choose
to be fabulous.

34:31.170 --> 34:34.036
Fabulous chose me.

34:34.039 --> 34:35.672
Arm.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.274
<i>I was thinking maybe
you could be a little</i>

34:37.275 --> 34:38.842
less fabulous tomorrow.

34:38.844 --> 34:41.043
- Just tone it down a little.
- What?

34:41.045 --> 34:43.447
<i>I just think if the guys
got to know you the way I do</i>

34:43.449 --> 34:46.750
then your situation at school
might get a whole lot better.

34:46.752 --> 34:49.085
Less ostrich feather,
a little more wrangler.

34:50.221 --> 34:52.722
And, uh..

34:52.724 --> 34:54.558
N.. Say it.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.193
I'm sure it'll
only be insulting

34:56.195 --> 34:57.928
for the first minute
or two.

34:57.930 --> 35:01.298
Just, uh,
lay off the, uh..

35:01.300 --> 35:02.566
...the, the, "hey, girl."

35:02.568 --> 35:04.267
Why don't we save that
for after school

35:04.269 --> 35:07.604
and stick to chicks, cars and
zombie flicks from 8:30 to 3:00?

35:07.606 --> 35:10.307
So, you want me to change
who I am for them?

35:10.309 --> 35:12.709
No, for me.

35:12.711 --> 35:16.313
<i>I think we've established that I'd
do pretty much anything for him.</i>

35:17.215 --> 35:18.482
I'll think about it.

35:18.484 --> 35:21.218
- Ta-da. I'm done.
- Finally.

35:25.223 --> 35:28.425
Flip, it is
beyond beyond.

35:28.427 --> 35:30.127
- This is...
- yeah?

35:30.129 --> 35:32.829
<i>Oh, I like that shoe.</i>

35:34.499 --> 35:36.233
<i>It's really beautiful.</i>

35:37.568 --> 35:39.035
Thank you.

35:45.009 --> 35:47.511
Well, look at you.

35:47.513 --> 35:49.846
It was flip's idea.

35:49.848 --> 35:52.015
You know, you'll never
be able to get

35:52.017 --> 35:54.851
what you want from a boy
like flip Kelly.

35:54.853 --> 35:57.454
Florence,
we're just friends.

35:57.456 --> 36:00.323
And I don't want anything
more from that relationship.

36:00.325 --> 36:02.859
<i>Really,
I don't need love.</i>

36:02.861 --> 36:06.263
Or sex
or physical attention.

36:06.265 --> 36:09.166
I'm perfectly happy with
things the way they are.

36:09.168 --> 36:11.368
Thank you very much.

36:11.370 --> 36:13.803
Well, you might be able
to tell that to yourself

36:13.805 --> 36:16.072
but you can't tell that
to old Florence.

36:17.542 --> 36:19.876
What.. Uh!
Your lunch. Hello?

36:25.850 --> 36:27.884
Would it kill you
to cut off the crust?

36:33.291 --> 36:34.624
I can't. I can't.

36:34.626 --> 36:35.692
- Yes, you can.
- I can't.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.327
Yes, you can. Trust me.

36:37.329 --> 36:39.362
How can I face them after
what they did to me, huh?

36:39.364 --> 36:41.464
How can they face you?

36:41.466 --> 36:43.934
That's their shit, Billy.
Come on. I got your back.

37:02.887 --> 37:05.188
It's great
to have you back, Billy.

37:05.190 --> 37:07.324
<i>Translation,
"please don't sue me."</i>

37:09.393 --> 37:10.994
<i>For the yearbook, Billy.</i>

37:11.929 --> 37:13.496
Whatever I can
do for you..

37:13.498 --> 37:15.699
I'll let you know,
Mrs. monusky.

37:15.701 --> 37:18.168
- I'll let you know.
- Okay, class?

37:22.373 --> 37:24.608
Ready? Okay!

37:24.610 --> 37:27.043
B- i-l-l-y.

37:27.045 --> 37:29.212
<i>Who's our high school's
favorite guy?</i>

37:29.214 --> 37:31.281
<i>- Billy!
- Billy.</i>

37:35.286 --> 37:37.420
Peace be with you.

37:37.422 --> 37:39.923
Let the healing begin.

37:44.562 --> 37:45.996
<i>Hello.</i>

37:53.438 --> 37:55.639
Make that leap.
Make that leap.

37:55.641 --> 37:57.907
Hey, what are you guys
talking about?

37:57.909 --> 37:59.442
Fashion.

37:59.444 --> 38:01.411
'Cause I thought that
we were talkin' football.

38:01.413 --> 38:03.613
We were talkin'
about shoulder pads.

38:03.615 --> 38:06.950
Fyi, they rocked the
runway in Paris last spring.

38:06.952 --> 38:09.486
Well, I thought we were
talking about football.

38:09.488 --> 38:11.788
And anyway, you didn't say
anything about my pants.

38:11.790 --> 38:14.291
Are these butch,
baby, or what?

38:15.426 --> 38:16.493
Billy?

38:17.561 --> 38:19.329
I thought we said

38:19.331 --> 38:21.598
more wrangler,
less fabulous.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.233
Yeah, I thought
you were joking.

38:24.935 --> 38:26.202
I'm not.

38:30.074 --> 38:32.409
Fag!

39:15.786 --> 39:17.187
Billy?

39:17.189 --> 39:18.355
Now, before
you say anything

39:18.357 --> 39:20.457
you said after school,
i could be me.

39:20.459 --> 39:23.727
And this is me.

39:25.329 --> 39:26.830
You look awesome.

39:26.832 --> 39:27.997
<i>Seriously?</i>

39:27.999 --> 39:29.899
Four hours
in hair and makeup.

39:29.901 --> 39:33.136
I've been preened, plucked
and bustiered so tightly

39:33.138 --> 39:36.239
that my toes are turning
blue, and "awesome"?

39:36.241 --> 39:37.741
No.

39:37.743 --> 39:41.544
I look atlantastic.

39:43.080 --> 39:45.515
Okay, atlantastic.

39:45.517 --> 39:47.650
Why'd you run away
after class today?

39:47.652 --> 39:50.587
I didn't run.
I was chased.

39:50.589 --> 39:51.588
Oh.

39:53.324 --> 39:55.592
We're making progress,
right?

39:55.594 --> 39:57.861
I mean, you're not getting beamed
in the head as much anymore.

39:57.863 --> 40:00.997
Am I not?
This is crazy.

40:00.999 --> 40:02.399
I'm compromising myself
for reasons

40:02.401 --> 40:04.934
I don't even
understand anymore.

40:04.936 --> 40:06.503
I need a drink.

40:09.907 --> 40:11.040
Want me to hold
your thing?

40:11.042 --> 40:12.409
Shut up.

40:16.681 --> 40:19.849
Flip, flip!
I'm so sorry.

40:19.851 --> 40:22.218
I'm so sorry. I must've
made them pretty strong.

40:22.220 --> 40:24.020
I forgot, that's how
muv likes them.

40:24.022 --> 40:26.189
Stop callin' me flip.

40:26.191 --> 40:28.391
I hate it.
It's a stupid nickname.

40:28.393 --> 40:29.859
Call me mark.

40:31.295 --> 40:32.629
Mark.

40:37.202 --> 40:38.668
You know what, Billy?

40:40.538 --> 40:41.704
You're alright.

40:42.773 --> 40:44.140
Thank you very much.

40:44.142 --> 40:46.309
No, I mean it.
I mean it.

40:46.311 --> 40:48.311
You are who you are, and..

40:50.080 --> 40:52.482
And... Yes?

40:57.455 --> 40:59.055
I have somethin' for you.

41:08.098 --> 41:10.099
His name's Lenny.

41:10.101 --> 41:12.001
I want you to have him.

41:14.605 --> 41:16.639
- Really?
- Take him.

41:21.078 --> 41:23.847
<i>I mean, so what
if he's half-burnt?</i>

41:23.849 --> 41:26.516
<i>He's screwed up.
He'll fit right in here.</i>

41:26.518 --> 41:28.852
You know what I mean?

41:28.854 --> 41:31.154
<i>I wanna tell him I don't
know what he's talking about</i>

41:31.156 --> 41:33.957
<i>but I don't wanna
ruin the moment.</i>

41:33.959 --> 41:36.960
<i>I think he's tryin' to explain
our friendship in straight terms</i>

41:36.962 --> 41:39.095
<i>which I'm not
very fluent in.</i>

41:39.097 --> 41:41.130
<i>Billy, you're gonna
be great tomorrow.</i>

41:41.132 --> 41:43.433
They're gonna love you.

41:43.435 --> 41:45.602
Just remember,
no pizazz, alright?

41:49.507 --> 41:52.509
Hey, no pizazz, alright?

41:54.645 --> 41:56.412
I've gotta be me, mark.

41:58.449 --> 41:59.916
Do you?

42:12.730 --> 42:14.564
I've got to be me.

42:34.418 --> 42:36.653
The pain!

42:37.755 --> 42:39.556
Do you feel the flames?

42:39.558 --> 42:42.125
Do you feel the hellfire
flickerin' at your feet?

42:43.193 --> 42:46.329
I am the ghost

42:46.331 --> 42:48.631
of Zelda Fitzgerald.

42:50.401 --> 42:53.169
And when I danced
upon this mortal coil

42:53.171 --> 42:55.004
with my husband,
f. Scott, and I

42:55.006 --> 42:58.074
we knew boundless joy

42:58.076 --> 43:01.678
and unfathomable pain.

43:03.180 --> 43:06.015
Our larger-than-life
escapades

43:06.017 --> 43:08.518
and violent,
gin-fueled tantrums

43:08.520 --> 43:10.753
defined
the roarin' twenties.

43:10.755 --> 43:12.956
And I, I still remember

43:12.958 --> 43:15.091
how we danced

43:15.093 --> 43:18.595
how we drank,
how we fought

43:18.597 --> 43:22.098
and how we loved

43:22.100 --> 43:26.769
like there was
no... Tomorrow.

43:26.771 --> 43:29.572
And now..

43:29.574 --> 43:31.107
...as my skin

43:31.109 --> 43:35.411
blisters and burns

43:35.413 --> 43:39.415
scorches and curls
off the meat

43:39.417 --> 43:43.019
and with every flame lick
i endure

43:44.655 --> 43:47.790
I'm reminded of my own..

43:47.792 --> 43:50.326
...personal damnation.

43:50.328 --> 43:52.128
From madcap

43:52.130 --> 43:55.064
to just plain mad..

43:55.066 --> 43:59.502
...i am Zelda Fitzgerald!

44:02.673 --> 44:05.842
And I wrote
"the great gatsby."

44:09.747 --> 44:11.080
And scene.

44:16.520 --> 44:18.921
In all 27 years
of my teaching

44:18.923 --> 44:21.624
I have never been more
thrilled by a book report.

44:21.626 --> 44:23.459
Oh, no, no, no.

44:23.461 --> 44:25.094
Mrs. monusky,
that's so kind.

44:25.096 --> 44:28.631
If you'll excuse me, I've
gotta scrape cereal off my face.

44:28.633 --> 44:29.866
Of course.

45:01.733 --> 45:05.568
Maybe dancing on the
coffee table was a bad idea.

45:05.570 --> 45:07.804
Listen to me, junebug.

45:07.806 --> 45:10.373
You only get one shot
at the pageant

45:10.375 --> 45:13.643
<i>so who cares if you
smash up a few tables?</i>

45:13.645 --> 45:15.411
<i>At least you danced.</i>

45:15.413 --> 45:17.580
Jesus Christ!

45:17.582 --> 45:19.082
Oh!

45:19.084 --> 45:22.418
Well, if it isn't
the disappearing man.

45:22.420 --> 45:24.253
You missed it all,
William.

45:24.255 --> 45:27.390
And yet,
you were not missed.

45:27.392 --> 45:29.358
Goddammit, muv,
what's wrong with you?

45:29.360 --> 45:30.893
Stop it!
Don't yell at her!

45:30.895 --> 45:32.762
It's okay. I'm used to it.

45:32.764 --> 45:33.896
What were you thinking?

45:33.898 --> 45:35.164
Stop! I did it!

45:35.166 --> 45:37.767
- I broke the table!
- Is that the truth?

45:37.769 --> 45:41.037
<i>"The truth is rarely pure
and never simple."</i>

45:41.039 --> 45:43.573
- What?
- Oscar wilde, you philistine.

45:43.575 --> 45:46.075
- Just go to bed!
- At least I danced.

45:46.077 --> 45:48.244
Isn't that right, muv?

45:48.246 --> 45:50.947
Yes, love. That's right.

45:52.282 --> 45:53.382
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

45:53.384 --> 45:55.585
<i>Ever let the fancy roam.</i>

45:58.857 --> 46:01.057
Hey, ladies,
get in line!

46:01.059 --> 46:03.025
Time to hit the rope.

46:03.027 --> 46:04.961
<i>You know the drill.</i>

46:04.963 --> 46:06.963
<i>One of you holds.</i>

46:06.965 --> 46:07.897
One of you climbs.

46:07.899 --> 46:10.967
Coach Carter. Sir. Hi.

46:10.969 --> 46:12.635
I don't feel like
this is something

46:12.637 --> 46:14.036
I should be doing.

46:14.038 --> 46:16.873
This isn't
a therapy session.

46:16.875 --> 46:19.275
That's the whole point!

46:19.277 --> 46:21.711
You're not
supposed to feel!

46:21.713 --> 46:24.747
You're supposed
to be a man and do!

46:24.749 --> 46:26.482
Now let's go!

46:26.484 --> 46:29.118
Bloom, you hold.

46:29.120 --> 46:31.721
Bo-Bo, you climb.

46:34.057 --> 46:35.858
You can handle that,
right?

46:39.096 --> 46:40.463
Feelings?

46:54.144 --> 46:57.246
Oh, sweet, baby Jesus,
no, no, no.

46:57.248 --> 46:58.815
<i>Don't do this to me.</i>

46:58.817 --> 47:00.416
<i>Not Bo-Bo.</i>

47:00.418 --> 47:03.753
<i>Another perfect specimen
of gluteus and Maximus.</i>

47:03.755 --> 47:05.454
<i>I closed my eyes
for one second</i>

47:05.456 --> 47:08.257
<i>and my president Johnson
was saluting the troops.</i>

47:09.793 --> 47:11.761
<i>Hey, Bo-Bo, Billy's got
a present for you.</i>

47:11.763 --> 47:12.995
And it's tiny.

47:17.100 --> 47:20.136
<i>Hey, guys, guys!
Just quit it!</i>

47:20.138 --> 47:21.871
Hey!

47:21.873 --> 47:23.940
<i>Knock it off.</i>

47:23.942 --> 47:26.342
<i>It's embarrassing enough
as it is.</i>

47:27.711 --> 47:30.279
Bloom, why don't you
hit the showers?

47:30.281 --> 47:32.014
Make it a cold one.

47:34.051 --> 47:36.285
- Oh!
- Oh!

47:40.291 --> 47:42.558
Alright, you morons

47:42.560 --> 47:44.894
this kind of thing
can happen to anyone.

47:44.896 --> 47:47.029
<i>A hundred push-ups
right now!</i>

47:47.031 --> 47:49.498
It could.

47:49.500 --> 47:52.735
His ass was in my face. It
could have been anyone's ass.

47:52.737 --> 47:54.537
- Yo...
- I'm at the mercy of my hormones!

47:54.539 --> 47:55.972
Look, dude, all I'm
sayin' is that it's just

47:55.974 --> 47:57.573
it's a tough thing
to live down, alright?

47:57.575 --> 47:59.008
Maybe it's not
such a big deal.

47:59.010 --> 48:01.410
I mean, coach Carter said
this happens to everybody.

48:01.412 --> 48:03.746
Don't even think about taking
a shower with us, boner.

48:03.748 --> 48:06.082
Oh, come on, man.

48:06.084 --> 48:07.416
Dickwad.

48:07.418 --> 48:08.985
Leave him alone.

48:08.987 --> 48:10.653
What, are you two
butt buddies or somethin'?

48:10.655 --> 48:13.189
Dude, back off.

48:13.191 --> 48:15.958
Oh, so you are!
You're fudge packers.

48:16.894 --> 48:18.227
Shut up!

48:20.497 --> 48:21.764
Oh!

48:27.537 --> 48:29.238
Fight! Fight!

48:30.841 --> 48:32.441
Hey, break it up!

48:32.443 --> 48:34.510
Break it up! Break it up!

48:34.512 --> 48:36.846
- Fucking faggot!
- Are you kidding me?

48:38.248 --> 48:41.017
It's homecoming
in two weeks.

48:42.119 --> 48:43.953
Are you trying
to make me bench you?

48:45.522 --> 48:48.524
Look at me.
What's goin' on?

48:48.526 --> 48:50.359
Is there something you
need to talk about, flip?

48:50.361 --> 48:51.861
No, nothing.

48:54.197 --> 48:55.831
Help me out here, guys.

48:57.367 --> 48:59.035
What's goin' on?

48:59.037 --> 49:02.305
Billy, what's goin' on?
Billy. Billy!

49:09.313 --> 49:11.647
Oh, flip, flip, please
tell me it's not true.

49:11.649 --> 49:12.982
You're not gay, right?

49:12.984 --> 49:14.750
<i>Flip, I heard Billy
was practically</i>

49:14.752 --> 49:16.152
ass raping you
in gym class.

49:16.154 --> 49:18.254
That's a lie, and besides,
i was behind him.

49:18.256 --> 49:20.489
Well, at least
we know you're the top.

49:20.491 --> 49:21.891
<i>Would you shut up?</i>

49:21.893 --> 49:23.926
Hey, hey, hey,
are you okay?

49:23.928 --> 49:25.094
Yeah, I'm okay, I'm fine.

49:25.096 --> 49:27.663
Would you just please
just get out of here?

49:27.665 --> 49:28.831
I was just trying to help.

49:28.833 --> 49:30.099
Well, stop helpin', okay?

49:30.101 --> 49:31.334
<i>You know what,
we'll let you guys</i>

49:31.336 --> 49:33.436
<i>have your little
lover's quarrel alone.</i>

49:33.438 --> 49:34.804
- We're not...
- let's get out of here, mark. Come on.

49:34.806 --> 49:36.439
Get off me, you homo!

49:39.076 --> 49:42.678
<i>Oh, no,
trouble in paradise?</i>

50:02.032 --> 50:03.699
Muv?

50:04.801 --> 50:07.103
<i>- Muv?
- Hi.</i>

50:07.105 --> 50:08.604
Junebug!

50:11.208 --> 50:14.477
Mr. bloom is on his way.

50:14.479 --> 50:16.278
I see you found the bar.

50:17.314 --> 50:19.181
You're out of gin.

50:19.183 --> 50:21.050
I've missed you so much.

50:21.052 --> 50:22.184
I can't stand
another second.

50:22.186 --> 50:24.353
Just take me home.

50:24.355 --> 50:25.955
Let me look at you.

50:27.057 --> 50:29.625
Darling, when did you
start wearing blue jeans?

50:29.627 --> 50:32.228
Oh, no. I know. But they're
really common around here.

50:32.230 --> 50:35.064
I know, that's the
problem. They're so common.

50:35.066 --> 50:37.533
Oh, I was
so worried about you.

50:37.535 --> 50:39.535
I came as soon as I heard
you were in a coma.

50:39.537 --> 50:41.303
That was five weeks ago.

50:41.305 --> 50:44.040
I'm sorry I couldn't get here
any earlier. I've been abroad.

50:44.042 --> 50:46.409
Is that what they call
rehab these days?

50:47.677 --> 50:49.912
Isn't there a toilet
around here

50:49.914 --> 50:52.048
that needs
scrubbing, flossy.

50:52.050 --> 50:55.384
Nothing around here needs
scrubbing except for your mouth.

50:55.386 --> 50:57.153
My angel.

50:57.155 --> 50:59.755
<i>- Where's daddy, darling?
- Hiding.</i>

51:02.492 --> 51:05.261
Junebug.

51:05.263 --> 51:07.430
Be a lamb and make
your muv another drinkie.

51:07.432 --> 51:09.265
Do you want
a Tequila mockingbird?

51:09.267 --> 51:11.100
Or a sunset boulevard
bourbon on the rocks?

51:11.102 --> 51:12.768
Surprise me.

51:28.085 --> 51:29.485
<i>Voila!</i>

51:33.957 --> 51:35.257
Put that thing out.

51:43.300 --> 51:44.533
Happy?

51:46.136 --> 51:47.203
Billy, go to your room.

51:48.905 --> 51:50.306
No. I'm not
going anywhere.

51:50.308 --> 51:51.474
Please, son,
just go upstairs.

51:51.476 --> 51:54.076
You're just upset because
muv's come back for me

51:54.078 --> 51:57.079
and we're getting out
of Satan's strip mall.

51:57.081 --> 51:58.914
You know what, honey, i
think your father's right.

51:58.916 --> 52:00.449
- No. You know what?
- You better go up...

52:00.451 --> 52:02.718
stay here.

52:02.720 --> 52:05.121
Well, that didn't
take long, Miriam.

52:05.123 --> 52:08.124
<i>I just stopped
the payment on Thursday.</i>

52:08.126 --> 52:10.259
It's mauveine, bill.

52:10.261 --> 52:12.328
Actually, it's not.

52:12.330 --> 52:14.663
You know what,
I'll go start packing.

52:14.665 --> 52:16.232
Goddammit, wake up!

52:16.234 --> 52:18.067
She's not here
to take you home!

52:18.069 --> 52:21.103
Yes, she is. Tell him.

52:21.105 --> 52:22.972
We're going home, right?

52:24.241 --> 52:25.174
Is that why you're here?

52:26.743 --> 52:27.810
Mom?

52:30.280 --> 52:32.148
Don't call me that.

52:37.021 --> 52:40.256
The deal is, son,
Oscar had it half-right.

52:40.258 --> 52:42.191
The truth is rarely pure

52:42.193 --> 52:44.994
but it's often
very simple.

52:46.630 --> 52:48.030
Ah..

52:50.468 --> 52:54.370
Look, I need that money.

52:54.372 --> 52:57.339
I deserve it.
I deserve it!

52:57.341 --> 52:58.807
I'm not paying you
child support

52:58.809 --> 53:01.610
for a child
you don't support.

53:01.612 --> 53:04.346
<i>Support him?</i>

53:04.348 --> 53:07.249
Christ, I was
gonna flush him.

53:09.019 --> 53:11.220
You wanted a son.

53:11.222 --> 53:13.389
I gave you a son.

53:13.391 --> 53:15.291
So pay up.

53:15.293 --> 53:16.625
Checkie!

53:18.061 --> 53:20.296
<i>Just write the check
and I'll be out of here.</i>

54:06.076 --> 54:08.644
- You cut the crust off?
- Mm-hmm.

54:13.083 --> 54:15.417
- Thank you.
- You bet.

54:27.430 --> 54:31.267
Well.. Hello!

54:31.269 --> 54:33.702
Hi, ma'am.
Is, uh, is Billy home?

54:33.704 --> 54:35.271
Drink?
Something to drink?

54:35.273 --> 54:37.306
Oh, no. No.
No, thank you.

54:37.308 --> 54:39.275
I just, I just really
need to, to see Billy.

54:40.310 --> 54:41.910
I'm mauveine.

54:41.912 --> 54:44.146
<i>Enchante.</i>

54:44.148 --> 54:46.282
You're, you're muv?

54:46.284 --> 54:47.716
Wow! Wow, ma'am!

54:47.718 --> 54:50.319
It's... it's a pleasure
for me to meet you.

54:50.321 --> 54:52.154
I've heard so much
about you from Billy.

54:53.923 --> 54:56.191
Friend of Billy's?

54:59.896 --> 55:01.497
That's how they
do it in Paris.

55:01.499 --> 55:02.998
I've never been to Paris.

55:04.434 --> 55:06.635
Football player too, huh?

55:06.637 --> 55:08.504
- Yes, ma'am.
- Huh.

55:08.506 --> 55:10.339
Isn't that
a co-in-ki-dink?

55:10.341 --> 55:13.809
You know, I was

55:13.811 --> 55:16.312
a big-time cheerleader.

55:16.314 --> 55:17.946
I was.

55:17.948 --> 55:20.349
<i>Rah. Rah.</i>

55:20.351 --> 55:21.517
Rah!

55:21.519 --> 55:23.585
Ms. muv, ma'am, it's been

55:23.587 --> 55:25.788
it's been real nice getting
to know you, Ms. muv.

55:25.790 --> 55:27.856
- But I've really got to go see bi...
- shake it to the left.

55:27.858 --> 55:29.191
Shake it to the right.

55:29.193 --> 55:31.660
Hit 'em to the left,
hit 'em to the right.

55:31.662 --> 55:34.463
Stand up, sit down,
fight, fight, fight! Ah!

55:34.465 --> 55:37.433
Oh, god! Oh!
Ms. muv! Ms. muv!

55:37.435 --> 55:39.034
Let's get you up.
Come here, alright.

55:39.036 --> 55:40.602
Here we go.
Here we go.

55:40.604 --> 55:42.037
Oh!

55:42.039 --> 55:43.439
Oh!

55:47.110 --> 55:49.278
- Oh, junebug? Junebug?
- Billy?

55:49.280 --> 55:51.447
June... Bug?

55:51.449 --> 55:53.615
With all due respect,
ma'am, you're drunk.

55:53.617 --> 55:55.384
That's the smartest thing
I've heard you say

55:55.386 --> 55:57.052
since I met you, son.

55:57.054 --> 55:59.455
You know what,
i have cleaned the toilets

55:59.457 --> 56:01.490
and now it's time
to take out the trash.

56:01.492 --> 56:04.526
Oh, simmer down, slugger.

56:04.528 --> 56:07.963
My uber... Awaits.

56:23.380 --> 56:25.914
<i>Sometimes, I dream
I can fly.</i>

56:27.417 --> 56:31.253
<i>But I'm so exhausted
from flapping my wings</i>

56:31.255 --> 56:33.555
<i>and the higher I soar,
it reminds me</i>

56:33.557 --> 56:36.558
<i>of how little I fit in
with them on the ground.</i>

56:39.162 --> 56:41.363
<i>So..</i>

56:41.365 --> 56:44.199
<i>...i rise..</i>

56:44.201 --> 56:47.503
<i>...and I rise,
and I realize that..</i>

56:56.379 --> 56:59.381
<i>...i don't wanna
fly anymore.</i>

56:59.383 --> 57:02.351
<i>They never knew what they
were looking up at anyway.</i>

57:03.520 --> 57:06.688
And so, it is
with great excitation

57:06.690 --> 57:08.924
and an okay
from the almighty

57:08.926 --> 57:11.794
that I announce
my candidacy

57:11.796 --> 57:13.128
for homecoming queen!

57:15.800 --> 57:18.133
Over my dead body!

57:20.904 --> 57:23.539
Look! We've got a jumper!

57:23.541 --> 57:24.807
It's Billy bloom!

57:26.376 --> 57:29.311
I'm not killing myself,
you philistines!

57:29.313 --> 57:31.880
I've never been more
determined to live in my life.

57:31.882 --> 57:35.284
I'm not gonna let some
Bible-humping debutante

57:35.286 --> 57:36.885
<i>make a mockery
of everything</i>

57:36.887 --> 57:38.587
<i>I hold dear in this life.</i>

57:38.589 --> 57:40.622
Glamour, pageantry

57:40.624 --> 57:42.724
and good hair.

57:42.726 --> 57:45.928
I am announcing
my candidacy

57:45.930 --> 57:49.631
for homecoming queen!

57:56.639 --> 57:59.475
<i>Lynette! Help!
Are you dead?</i>

58:01.277 --> 58:02.678
It's time
to put a real queen

58:02.680 --> 58:04.446
in charge of things
around here.

58:04.448 --> 58:05.848
Wait, wait. What happened?
This is my interview.

58:05.850 --> 58:07.483
Give me a second
please, Lynette.

58:07.485 --> 58:10.686
It... it's bloom,
isn't it? The coma kid?

58:10.688 --> 58:12.921
Now, how do you wanna
be identified on camera?

58:12.923 --> 58:15.090
Gay? Straight?
Transgender?

58:15.092 --> 58:17.025
Transvisionary.

58:17.027 --> 58:18.594
Gender obliviator.

58:18.596 --> 58:19.595
Freak!

58:21.498 --> 58:24.533
Okay, yeah, well, i was gonna
reclaim it as my own anyway.

58:24.535 --> 58:25.701
Works for me.

58:25.703 --> 58:28.170
Wait, uh, now,
this is my dream.

58:28.172 --> 58:30.706
I'm standing here
with Billy bloom

58:30.708 --> 58:32.441
self-proclaimed freak

58:32.443 --> 58:35.043
here at
ulysses s. Grant academy

58:35.045 --> 58:37.112
where history
is being made.

58:37.114 --> 58:40.182
And this young man,
that's right, I said man

58:40.184 --> 58:42.618
just announced
his candidacy

58:42.620 --> 58:43.819
for homecoming queen!

58:43.821 --> 58:45.521
Billy? Thank god.

58:45.523 --> 58:48.323
Oh, I was so worried.
You didn't text me back.

58:48.325 --> 58:50.959
You don't need
to be afraid. They do.

58:50.961 --> 58:52.694
Tell us about
your platform, Billy.

58:52.696 --> 58:55.531
- Him? What about me?
- Well.

58:55.533 --> 58:57.733
My platform is simple.

58:57.735 --> 59:00.869
I am pro-glamour,
I'm anti-khaki.

59:00.871 --> 59:03.572
I am pro-any-artistic-risk

59:03.574 --> 59:06.542
and I'm against any
attempts at categorization.

59:06.544 --> 59:08.644
I am here to bring an end
to the hatred

59:08.646 --> 59:11.013
I've found
at ulysses s. Grant

59:11.015 --> 59:13.215
and the world at large.

59:21.724 --> 59:23.892
What do you think
you're doing?

59:23.894 --> 59:26.528
<i>I'm going to watch golf</i>

59:26.530 --> 59:28.230
<i>in peace.</i>

59:28.232 --> 59:29.698
Don't give me that look.

59:29.700 --> 59:31.733
- What look?
- That look!

59:31.735 --> 59:34.736
Oh, I know the world
is a horrible place

59:34.738 --> 59:36.872
for rich, handsome,
entitled men.

59:36.874 --> 59:38.240
Cry me a river.

59:38.242 --> 59:40.375
I didn't ask him
to come here.

59:40.377 --> 59:42.244
And that was
your first mistake.

59:43.246 --> 59:45.681
<i>I love my job, Mr. bloom.</i>

59:45.683 --> 59:47.349
Lord knows
i love this family.

59:47.351 --> 59:48.784
But I'll walk
straight out that door

59:48.786 --> 59:50.385
right here and now

59:50.387 --> 59:52.621
if you don't stop
acting like an ass.

59:52.623 --> 59:53.855
That's enough.

59:53.857 --> 59:55.958
<i>Oh, but I haven't
even started.</i>

59:55.960 --> 59:58.594
<i>Did you forget that
this is the child</i>

59:58.596 --> 01:00:00.395
<i>that you prayed for?</i>

01:00:00.397 --> 01:00:02.397
Well, I remember,
because I'm the one

01:00:02.399 --> 01:00:04.199
who taught you
how to pray.

01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:05.767
Well, I didn't
pray for this.

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:07.235
It's all over the news.

01:00:07.237 --> 01:00:10.038
He's running
for homecoming queen.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.707
He is telling the monsters

01:00:11.709 --> 01:00:14.376
who put him in a coma

01:00:14.378 --> 01:00:17.546
"i will not let your abuse
and your insults

01:00:17.548 --> 01:00:19.648
"define how I wear..

01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:21.183
...my tiara."

01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:29.157
I'd rather be
with my son.

01:00:29.159 --> 01:00:31.493
But he doesn't
want me.

01:00:31.495 --> 01:00:33.462
I tried.

01:00:33.464 --> 01:00:36.932
I tried in Darien
but muv shut me down.

01:00:36.934 --> 01:00:41.269
I tried here
and... He shut me out.

01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:42.704
So keep trying.

01:00:46.809 --> 01:00:49.811
You have more
in common with that boy

01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:51.213
than you think.

01:01:08.364 --> 01:01:10.766
Hey, girl, hey!

01:01:10.768 --> 01:01:12.701
Billy, what do you
think you're doing?

01:01:12.703 --> 01:01:15.604
Be gone, you have
no powers here.

01:01:15.606 --> 01:01:18.707
Homecoming queen?
Billy?

01:01:18.709 --> 01:01:20.776
Are you serious?

01:01:20.778 --> 01:01:21.977
There's nothing
i can do for you now.

01:01:21.979 --> 01:01:23.612
Don't you get that?

01:01:25.014 --> 01:01:27.783
You've done
quite enough, mark.

01:01:27.785 --> 01:01:30.619
Okay, you know what?
Fine.

01:01:30.621 --> 01:01:31.787
You do what you want.

01:01:31.789 --> 01:01:33.388
But don't expect me
to bail you out.

01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:35.390
From now on,
you're on your own.

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:40.862
Actually, I'm not.

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:48.904
How would you like
to be my sidekick?

01:01:48.906 --> 01:01:50.806
Billy, I... I have been
waiting my whole life

01:01:50.808 --> 01:01:52.908
for someone
to ask me that.

01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:54.009
N... no, I mean

01:01:54.011 --> 01:01:57.045
your name
is really Mary Jane?

01:01:57.047 --> 01:01:58.847
Yeah.
What did you think it was?

01:01:58.849 --> 01:02:00.348
Uh, it's not important
right now.

01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:02.884
We have bigger problems
to solve.

01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:06.388
And I don't want to do
this one alone.

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:07.823
You won't be alone.

01:02:07.825 --> 01:02:09.891
I mean, we'll all
be there for you!

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:11.727
<i>- So.. We?
- Okay, Billy.</i>

01:02:11.729 --> 01:02:14.196
I have wanting to tell you
about them forever.

01:02:14.198 --> 01:02:16.164
But I was bound by oath
to keep their secret

01:02:16.166 --> 01:02:18.200
until they told me
it was okay to let you in.

01:02:18.202 --> 01:02:19.901
<i>Who?</i>

01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:21.403
The shadow people.

01:02:21.405 --> 01:02:23.839
<i>- The who?
- The shadow people.</i>

01:02:24.874 --> 01:02:26.775
It's a secret population
of students

01:02:26.777 --> 01:02:29.411
who survive on the fringes
of the academy.

01:02:29.413 --> 01:02:32.047
<i>They live under the radar,
out of the spotlight.</i>

01:02:32.049 --> 01:02:34.416
<i>They're just regular
students, like you and me.</i>

01:02:34.418 --> 01:02:36.218
<i>I mean,
you see them everywhere.</i>

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:37.853
<i>You just don't
notice them</i>

01:02:37.855 --> 01:02:40.055
<i>because they know
how to blend in.</i>

01:02:40.057 --> 01:02:42.858
You see, the trick is you
have to be attractive enough

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:44.793
as to not draw attention

01:02:44.795 --> 01:02:47.095
but not attractive enough
as to stand out

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:49.731
<i>in a sea
of physical perfection.</i>

01:02:49.733 --> 01:02:53.068
<i>You have to be, um, a
strict seven and a half.</i>

01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:55.604
<i>They've been waiting
a long time</i>

01:02:55.606 --> 01:02:57.305
<i>for someone like you
to come along</i>

01:02:57.307 --> 01:02:59.975
<i>and they are ready
to lend their support.</i>

01:02:59.977 --> 01:03:01.810
I know you won't
let them down, Billy.

01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:05.714
Students of Grant academy

01:03:05.716 --> 01:03:07.048
for too long

01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:09.217
you have suffered
in silence.

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:13.255
I am like you.

01:03:13.257 --> 01:03:15.891
For too long, I thought
being on the outside

01:03:15.893 --> 01:03:17.826
meant having no voice.

01:03:17.828 --> 01:03:20.829
I accepted the moldings
and manipulations

01:03:20.831 --> 01:03:21.963
that were pushed upon me

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:24.232
and was still
shamed into silence.

01:03:24.234 --> 01:03:27.068
No more. No more!

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:29.337
No more. No more!

01:03:29.339 --> 01:03:33.475
<i>All that changes
from this moment on.</i>

01:03:33.477 --> 01:03:37.445
I know that without
hope, you cannot live.

01:03:37.447 --> 01:03:39.815
And without a bit of
glamour, you can't live well.

01:03:39.817 --> 01:03:41.950
We are important.

01:03:41.952 --> 01:03:44.586
And we owe it to the
kids that come after

01:03:44.588 --> 01:03:47.289
the little boys and girls
with the wrong haircut

01:03:47.291 --> 01:03:49.291
or wrong accent
or wrong curric...

01:03:49.293 --> 01:03:50.959
extra-curricular hobbies

01:03:50.961 --> 01:03:54.196
to try and push ourselves
into the light.

01:03:54.198 --> 01:03:56.131
Give them the hope
of seeing

01:03:56.133 --> 01:03:59.668
a boy nominated
for homecoming queen.

01:04:03.272 --> 01:04:04.706
This is Felicia watts

01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:06.875
back at ulysses
s. Grant academy

01:04:06.877 --> 01:04:08.944
where it's day five of

01:04:08.946 --> 01:04:10.846
"academy under siege."

01:04:10.848 --> 01:04:12.280
What's at stake?

01:04:12.282 --> 01:04:16.017
One girl's dream and every
girl's rights and privileges.

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:19.054
With me is
homecoming queen nominee

01:04:19.056 --> 01:04:20.355
lynnette Franz.

01:04:20.357 --> 01:04:22.557
Lynnette, can you
give us an update?

01:04:22.559 --> 01:04:23.992
Can I ever!

01:04:23.994 --> 01:04:25.060
Well..

01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:29.030
So, I was supposed to be

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:31.032
the only candidate
running this year.

01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:33.635
That's been the plan
since the seventh grade.

01:04:33.637 --> 01:04:37.038
But then, this
sexually confused weirdo

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.974
announced that
he was running.

01:04:38.976 --> 01:04:41.009
Now, I don't know, maybe

01:04:41.011 --> 01:04:43.645
maybe he doesn't realize
he's not a girl. Whatever.

01:04:43.647 --> 01:04:44.913
He doesn't stand
a chance of winning

01:04:44.915 --> 01:04:46.882
because everybody
hates him.

01:04:46.884 --> 01:04:48.183
Everybody?

01:04:48.185 --> 01:04:50.552
Lynnette, look at
the walls around you.

01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:53.054
The support
for Grant academy's

01:04:53.056 --> 01:04:56.358
gender obliviator
is palpable.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:59.060
With all due respect,
Felicia

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:00.829
this is a simple case of..

01:05:00.831 --> 01:05:03.064
...decency
versus depravity.

01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:05.267
Tradition
versus perdition.

01:05:05.269 --> 01:05:07.502
And by the end
of this election

01:05:07.504 --> 01:05:09.037
I believe.. No.

01:05:09.039 --> 01:05:11.706
I know
that this school

01:05:11.708 --> 01:05:14.542
and this nation
will come to its senses

01:05:14.544 --> 01:05:16.912
and put a real queen in
charge of things around here.

01:05:16.914 --> 01:05:18.780
So, you don't think
Billy bloom has a chance

01:05:18.782 --> 01:05:20.248
of taking home the tiara?

01:05:21.617 --> 01:05:24.419
A homosexual
representing our school?

01:05:25.888 --> 01:05:28.590
I'd laugh if he wasn't
being so disrespectful.

01:05:28.592 --> 01:05:29.925
I mean, it's like
he's peeing

01:05:29.927 --> 01:05:32.527
on the flag
or something.

01:05:32.529 --> 01:05:35.530
Look, he just
wants attention

01:05:35.532 --> 01:05:37.265
like all gays do,
you know?

01:05:38.534 --> 01:05:40.635
I do not.

01:05:40.637 --> 01:05:42.938
Well, so, they can further
their gay agenda.

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:46.308
And that is
the god's honest truth.

01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:47.876
What Billy is doing here

01:05:47.878 --> 01:05:49.978
by running
for homecoming queen

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:52.847
is destroying the way of
life here at the academy.

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:57.719
Let's make America
great again!

01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:01.990
Bye, Felicia.

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:10.131
Disgruntled, delusional..

01:06:12.001 --> 01:06:14.502
...but determined
homecoming queen candidate

01:06:14.504 --> 01:06:16.104
lynnette Franz.

01:06:16.106 --> 01:06:18.106
And I am sure
we have not heard

01:06:18.108 --> 01:06:19.841
the last of her.

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:32.020
And after me, say

01:06:32.022 --> 01:06:34.689
"let Billy bloom!"

01:06:34.691 --> 01:06:37.025
One, two, three..

01:06:37.027 --> 01:06:38.660
<i>- Let Billy bloom.
- Let Billy bloom.</i>

01:06:38.662 --> 01:06:40.295
Louder.
Come on.

01:06:40.297 --> 01:06:42.130
<i>- Let Billy bloom.
- One more time.</i>

01:06:42.132 --> 01:06:45.467
<i>- Let Billy bloom.
- Let Billy bloom.</i>

01:06:45.469 --> 01:06:47.202
Let Billy bloom!

01:06:58.447 --> 01:07:01.850
I love
the shadow people!

01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:07.022
They're like little
homecoming elves.

01:07:07.024 --> 01:07:10.225
Oh. Yes! There ain't no
stopping us now, Billy.

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:15.230
Alright, if we can get
one a-lister on our side

01:07:15.232 --> 01:07:16.898
I think we can turn this
whole election around.

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:18.133
Really, I do.

01:07:18.135 --> 01:07:21.669
- What about flip?
- Next.

01:07:21.671 --> 01:07:23.805
- Bo-Bo Peterson?
- Not gonna happen.

01:07:23.807 --> 01:07:25.073
No, I think we can
make it happen.

01:07:25.075 --> 01:07:27.042
I mean, honestly,
he hates lynnette now.

01:07:27.044 --> 01:07:29.644
<i>She broke up with him. She broke
his heart, banged his brother.</i>

01:07:29.646 --> 01:07:30.712
I love it.

01:07:30.714 --> 01:07:33.081
- Vote Lynette.
- Vote for me.

01:07:33.083 --> 01:07:35.517
- Vote for Lynette.
- Vote for Lynette.

01:07:35.519 --> 01:07:36.785
Vote for me.

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:40.655
Bo-Bo, I am so sorry

01:07:40.657 --> 01:07:42.057
to hear about
you and lynnette

01:07:42.059 --> 01:07:45.060
but have you given any
thought to the other candidate

01:07:45.062 --> 01:07:46.494
running for
homecoming queen?

01:07:46.496 --> 01:07:47.562
I ain't voting
for that ho!

01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:49.831
I'd just as soon vote
for a butt worm.

01:07:49.833 --> 01:07:52.300
Well, naturally,
i am flattered.

01:07:54.103 --> 01:07:56.271
You got my vote. Just
make sure you beat her.

01:07:56.273 --> 01:07:57.972
Welcome to team bloom!

01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:04.679
So, bib,
here's the deal.

01:08:04.681 --> 01:08:06.247
When I give the signal
at the pep rally

01:08:06.249 --> 01:08:08.183
you're gonna put
this button on your shirt.

01:08:10.286 --> 01:08:11.586
What's the "f" for,
"fag?"

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:15.857
No, it's for freak,
you freak.

01:08:15.859 --> 01:08:18.292
Or should i
call you kid krush?

01:08:18.295 --> 01:08:19.861
Okay, look, butt lick

01:08:19.863 --> 01:08:21.529
I don't know how you
found out about in twink

01:08:21.531 --> 01:08:23.598
but if you don't shut up
about it, I'll beat you so hard

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.567
you're gonna miss
that coma, you got it?

01:08:25.569 --> 01:08:27.102
It's not so much
did I get it

01:08:27.104 --> 01:08:30.305
but this young,
budding Tarantino did.

01:08:32.707 --> 01:08:34.309
Wait.
Where did she come from?

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.877
Only the shadows know.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.979
Now, do we
have your support

01:08:38.982 --> 01:08:40.915
or do you want that last
little hate crime rant

01:08:40.917 --> 01:08:42.283
to go viral?

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:55.063
- Oh, no. Not again.
- What is it?

01:08:55.064 --> 01:08:57.031
- Oh, it's nothing.
- No, no, no. Let me see.

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:03.104
"Dear Billy,
you are fierce."

01:09:03.106 --> 01:09:04.973
Ain't nothing wrong
with that.

01:09:04.975 --> 01:09:07.575
Yeah, keep going.

01:09:07.577 --> 01:09:09.310
Yadda, yadda, yadda..

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:11.179
"You make me sick.

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:13.515
"You're ruining
everything.

01:09:13.517 --> 01:09:15.750
"I'm going to tie you up
and fuck you

01:09:15.752 --> 01:09:18.051
till you love me,
faggot."

01:09:21.122 --> 01:09:23.323
Chill out,
all I'm trying to do

01:09:23.326 --> 01:09:26.261
is make this world
a little more pretty.

01:09:26.263 --> 01:09:28.429
I know, right?

01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:30.198
<i>A stalker means
you're officially famous</i>

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.666
<i>which is good news.</i>

01:09:32.968 --> 01:09:35.036
I'm going to have to
get you a security detail.

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:38.273
Yeah, I'm feeling
good about..

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:40.108
Yeah, I'll be
right back, alright?

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:42.277
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:52.120
I just wanted to say good luck with
the whole homecoming queen thing.

01:09:52.122 --> 01:09:54.355
Thank you.
And you, too.

01:09:54.357 --> 01:09:56.357
With the big match,
i... I mean.

01:09:56.359 --> 01:09:58.459
Not that...
the homecoming queen.

01:09:58.461 --> 01:10:01.095
Too many queens
would spoil the broth.

01:10:03.232 --> 01:10:05.700
- You're funny.
- You're flip.

01:10:08.304 --> 01:10:10.271
I miss hanging out
with you, Billy.

01:10:14.143 --> 01:10:15.343
- Aren't you done yet?
- Yeah, just..

01:10:15.345 --> 01:10:17.045
Just, uh,
just give us a second.

01:10:20.015 --> 01:10:21.082
It's been a second.

01:10:21.084 --> 01:10:22.650
Yeah, just give us
a minute!

01:10:25.854 --> 01:10:27.755
I'm taking sesame
to the dance.

01:10:27.757 --> 01:10:30.425
You know
they're fake, right?

01:10:30.427 --> 01:10:32.193
Billy, I think I'd know.

01:10:32.195 --> 01:10:35.430
Oh, you sweet,
innocent boy.

01:10:35.432 --> 01:10:37.265
Go. Go on.

01:10:37.267 --> 01:10:38.466
It's been a minute.

01:10:54.783 --> 01:10:57.018
Hey, Billy,
how's it going?

01:10:58.354 --> 01:11:00.388
I've had better days.

01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:03.424
I've got to sort out
all this stuff.

01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:06.794
- Do you want a ride?
- With you?

01:11:06.796 --> 01:11:09.330
I know I've been a dick, but
I wanna make things right.

01:11:10.733 --> 01:11:13.301
Yeah. Sure.
Thank you.

01:11:15.304 --> 01:11:17.772
Get off. Get off.

01:11:17.774 --> 01:11:19.240
Bernie, what the fuck..

01:11:19.242 --> 01:11:20.875
You don't mean that.

01:11:20.877 --> 01:11:22.477
Please don't tell anyone.

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:30.718
Don't tell anyone!

01:11:39.228 --> 01:11:42.130
Ladies and gentlemen,
hello, and welcome

01:11:42.132 --> 01:11:44.732
to the ulysses
s. Grant academy

01:11:44.734 --> 01:11:46.734
homecoming game pre-show.

01:11:49.072 --> 01:11:50.638
And I... and I know
how excited everyone is

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.307
to see
this year's nominees

01:11:52.309 --> 01:11:54.342
so without further ado

01:11:54.344 --> 01:11:55.576
I present
the parade of floats

01:11:55.578 --> 01:11:58.846
made by your homecoming
queen candidates.

01:11:58.848 --> 01:12:01.916
First up,
miss lynnette Franz!

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:19.200
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

01:12:19.202 --> 01:12:21.669
<i>These folks
expect a show!</i>

01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:24.372
<i>They want to be wowed!</i>

01:12:29.379 --> 01:12:31.312
<i>I mean,
this is the float</i>

01:12:31.314 --> 01:12:34.382
<i>that you've been planning
since the seventh grade?</i>

01:12:34.384 --> 01:12:37.552
<i>This float was meant
to be her legacy.</i>

01:12:37.554 --> 01:12:39.320
<i>It should have been
the ultimate expression</i>

01:12:39.322 --> 01:12:41.556
<i>of who she was, and the
culmination of all her hopes</i>

01:12:41.558 --> 01:12:45.226
<i>and dreams and heartfelt
artistic yearnings!</i>

01:12:45.228 --> 01:12:47.161
<i>Luckily, the crowd
didn't have too long</i>

01:12:47.163 --> 01:12:48.663
<i>to dwell on this
because..</i>

01:12:48.665 --> 01:12:49.997
And now,
ladies and gentlemen

01:12:49.999 --> 01:12:52.367
I present our
second candidate.

01:12:52.369 --> 01:12:54.001
<i>Here comes Billy bloom!</i>

01:13:56.099 --> 01:13:58.466
<i>Surely, I have
reached nirvana.</i>

01:13:59.902 --> 01:14:02.136
<i>This is heaven on earth</i>

01:14:02.138 --> 01:14:05.473
<i>and I haven't
even been crowned yet.</i>

01:14:05.475 --> 01:14:08.943
<i>So, let's not let
four quarters of football</i>

01:14:08.945 --> 01:14:10.611
<i>stand between me
and my tiara</i>

01:14:10.613 --> 01:14:12.547
<i>and just cut
to the end of the game.</i>

01:14:14.716 --> 01:14:17.785
<i>Let's go, Griffin.
Let's go!</i>

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:20.655
Let's go, Griffin.
Let's go!

01:14:20.657 --> 01:14:22.557
<i>There are 15 seconds
left to play</i>

01:14:22.559 --> 01:14:25.259
<i>and we're down by three.</i>

01:14:25.261 --> 01:14:27.328
<i>The fate of
the entire universe</i>

01:14:27.330 --> 01:14:29.764
<i>rests on flip's
broad shoulders.</i>

01:14:35.637 --> 01:14:37.472
<i>Touchdown!</i>

01:14:37.474 --> 01:14:39.474
<i>Oh, the griffins scores
and with that</i>

01:14:39.476 --> 01:14:41.909
<i>the griffins win, 27</i>

01:14:41.911 --> 01:14:43.811
<i>huskies, 24.</i>

01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:46.581
<i>I didn't see
the touchdown.</i>

01:14:46.583 --> 01:14:48.683
<i>I was looking at flip.</i>

01:14:48.685 --> 01:14:50.418
Is he okay?

01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:53.120
<i>Those scouts.</i>

01:14:53.122 --> 01:14:55.356
<i>His father.</i>

01:14:55.358 --> 01:14:56.424
<i>This game..</i>

01:14:56.426 --> 01:14:58.292
He'll be okay.

01:14:58.294 --> 01:15:00.495
<i>...it meant
everything to him.</i>

01:15:17.646 --> 01:15:20.181
<i>And just like that,
with one thumbs up</i>

01:15:20.183 --> 01:15:22.850
<i>flip Kelly was gone</i>

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:24.519
<i>and mark Kelly
could paint the world</i>

01:15:24.521 --> 01:15:26.187
<i>however he saw it.</i>

01:15:38.033 --> 01:15:40.234
I wanna congratulate
our griffins!

01:15:43.572 --> 01:15:45.039
<i>And especially
Bo-Bo Peterson.</i>

01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:47.708
<i>Stand up, Bo-Bo.</i>

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:49.510
<i>On a spectacular</i>

01:15:49.512 --> 01:15:50.912
<i>game-winning touchdown.</i>

01:15:55.317 --> 01:15:58.753
And our thoughts and
prayers go out to flip Kelly

01:15:58.755 --> 01:16:03.357
and hope that tonight's
unfortunate injury won't..

01:16:03.359 --> 01:16:04.725
Let's just keep him
in our thoughts.

01:16:04.727 --> 01:16:05.927
<i>But now, it's
time to give</i>

01:16:05.929 --> 01:16:07.828
our homecoming queen
nominees their chance

01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:09.697
to say something before

01:16:09.699 --> 01:16:11.899
the ballots are cast
and a winner is crowned.

01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:14.569
First up,
lynnette Franz.

01:16:22.578 --> 01:16:25.746
- Here, my dear.
- Thank you.

01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:28.316
Hi, everyone.
How you doin'?

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:34.055
<i>Okay..</i>

01:16:34.057 --> 01:16:36.424
<i>Principal onnigan,
faculty</i>

01:16:36.426 --> 01:16:38.960
<i>friends, cheer squad,
god squad</i>

01:16:38.962 --> 01:16:41.362
<i>alumni
and lunch ladies!</i>

01:16:41.364 --> 01:16:43.064
<i>Let's hear it
for the real girl!</i>

01:16:43.066 --> 01:16:45.132
<i>Me! Yay!</i>

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:49.236
So... First reason

01:16:49.238 --> 01:16:51.439
you should vote for me..

01:16:51.441 --> 01:16:53.240
...and, uh..

01:16:53.242 --> 01:16:55.743
...i kinda can't believe that
I have to remind you all this

01:16:55.745 --> 01:16:58.179
but apparently I do.

01:16:59.781 --> 01:17:02.383
Homecoming queens..
Hmm..

01:17:02.385 --> 01:17:04.785
Yeah, they're... they're,
they're girls, y'all!

01:17:07.056 --> 01:17:09.490
<i>You can't just decide
what's right and wrong</i>

01:17:09.492 --> 01:17:11.993
based on the cast
of "glee."

01:17:11.995 --> 01:17:15.062
<i>- Hashtag quotable.
- We love Lynette!</i>

01:17:15.064 --> 01:17:18.733
Second reason
you should vote for me.

01:17:18.735 --> 01:17:21.002
My rival..

01:17:21.004 --> 01:17:23.738
And I'm not even going to
dirty my lips to say his name.

01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:24.905
<i>Don't do it.</i>

01:17:24.907 --> 01:17:27.842
He seems to only be
interested in one thing

01:17:27.844 --> 01:17:29.677
<i>and that's
turning this school</i>

01:17:29.679 --> 01:17:31.512
<i>into some kind
of tranny bar.</i>

01:17:32.681 --> 01:17:35.583
All gays are
going to hell.

01:17:35.585 --> 01:17:38.786
<i>- Yup.
- And that's not me.</i>

01:17:38.788 --> 01:17:40.087
It's not me saying that.

01:17:40.089 --> 01:17:42.289
That's..

01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:44.258
That's leviticus.

01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:46.027
<i>That's right, yeah, girl.</i>

01:17:57.273 --> 01:17:58.673
Thank you.

01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:02.843
Thank you so much.

01:18:02.845 --> 01:18:04.545
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

01:18:06.281 --> 01:18:07.882
<i>You know, I've been
waiting for this day</i>

01:18:07.884 --> 01:18:09.684
<i>since I was
twelve years old.</i>

01:18:09.686 --> 01:18:12.720
I'm sure you all have too.

01:18:12.722 --> 01:18:14.055
That was enlightening.

01:18:15.724 --> 01:18:17.124
And our next contestant..

01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:20.528
...Billy bloom.

01:18:37.713 --> 01:18:39.814
Thank you, lynnette,
for that

01:18:39.816 --> 01:18:41.782
<i>most gracious set-up.</i>

01:18:44.052 --> 01:18:46.420
Now..

01:18:46.422 --> 01:18:49.423
My appearance tonight
might come as a shock

01:18:49.425 --> 01:18:51.592
to many of you.

01:18:51.594 --> 01:18:54.729
Sure, I could have worn a
real show-stopper of an outfit

01:18:54.731 --> 01:18:56.564
and talked smack
about lynnette

01:18:56.566 --> 01:18:59.867
<i>and reminded you all
how you tried to kill me</i>

01:18:59.869 --> 01:19:01.102
<i>and maybe you
could vote for me</i>

01:19:01.104 --> 01:19:02.837
<i>to try and clear
your conscience</i>

01:19:02.839 --> 01:19:05.339
but instead,
i stand before you.

01:19:07.609 --> 01:19:10.244
And I'm stripped of all my
usual bells and whistles.

01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:14.949
Just a clean-scrubbed face.

01:19:14.951 --> 01:19:16.250
To show you that..

01:19:18.386 --> 01:19:19.754
To show you that I'm

01:19:19.756 --> 01:19:22.523
I'm not so different
from you

01:19:22.525 --> 01:19:23.858
despite your protestations

01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:25.092
despite mine.

01:19:29.064 --> 01:19:30.865
You can call me a freak.
Okay.

01:19:32.434 --> 01:19:33.968
I am what I am.

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:38.806
You're all freaks too,
i mean..

01:19:38.808 --> 01:19:40.975
<i>Look at you.</i>

01:19:40.977 --> 01:19:43.144
<i>Isn't that what being
a teenager is all about?</i>

01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:47.882
I think that
we're all pretty worried

01:19:47.884 --> 01:19:50.818
that we're not
gonna fit in.

01:19:52.487 --> 01:19:55.456
That if people
found out the real us

01:19:55.458 --> 01:19:58.926
they would reject us, they
would recoil in horror.

01:19:58.928 --> 01:20:00.394
That they'd all hate us.

01:20:01.663 --> 01:20:02.897
<i>And we all carry around</i>

01:20:02.899 --> 01:20:05.699
<i>some kind
of secret shame.</i>

01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:11.539
We've each got
a flag to fly.

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:16.210
Just some of us are
flying them on the inside.

01:20:17.913 --> 01:20:21.916
<i>So, I am asking you to look
inside that secret place</i>

01:20:21.918 --> 01:20:25.853
<i>where your
freak flag flies</i>

01:20:25.855 --> 01:20:27.888
and raise it up..

01:20:29.591 --> 01:20:31.492
...loud..

01:20:31.494 --> 01:20:34.161
...and proud.

01:20:34.163 --> 01:20:36.096
Look, I know I have not
been here for very long

01:20:36.098 --> 01:20:39.934
but I am asking for a
tradition to take place now.

01:20:39.936 --> 01:20:42.937
A tradition of inclusion.

01:20:42.939 --> 01:20:45.372
Of acceptance.
Of tolerance.

01:20:48.143 --> 01:20:51.011
Love who you're
gonna love.

01:20:51.013 --> 01:20:54.048
Follow whatever path
it is that makes you

01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:56.784
be the person
that you are.

01:20:58.286 --> 01:21:00.221
<i>I... I've got one thing
to ask tonight</i>

01:21:00.223 --> 01:21:02.289
<i>when you cast
your ballot.</i>

01:21:02.291 --> 01:21:04.058
Vote for me.

01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:07.862
You're voting
for the freak

01:21:07.864 --> 01:21:10.698
in all of us.

01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:12.800
You're voting for the
freak that stands before you

01:21:12.802 --> 01:21:14.435
but you're voting for..

01:21:16.238 --> 01:21:18.973
...the freak in each
and every one of you.

01:21:21.176 --> 01:21:22.543
That's all.

01:21:37.058 --> 01:21:39.260
Yay! Billy!

01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:04.018
And now, students
of Grant academy

01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:07.021
it's time to get out your
smart phones and vote.

01:22:24.439 --> 01:22:26.040
<i>Well, the votes
have been tabulated</i>

01:22:26.042 --> 01:22:28.175
and you've all made your
feelings abundantly clear.

01:22:35.084 --> 01:22:38.319
<i>The winner is
lynnette Franz!</i>

01:22:42.325 --> 01:22:43.958
<i>Here she is,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.726
Your new
homecoming queen

01:22:45.728 --> 01:22:48.062
lynnette Franz!

01:22:48.064 --> 01:22:49.229
Thank you.

01:22:51.099 --> 01:22:52.466
Thank you.

01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:55.002
<i>The crowd who just
moments ago were on my side</i>

01:22:55.004 --> 01:22:57.838
<i>now applauded wildly
for her.</i>

01:23:00.075 --> 01:23:02.476
What are you still doing
on stage, freak?

01:23:02.478 --> 01:23:03.677
Get lost.

01:23:03.679 --> 01:23:06.080
Sesame, do you always
have to be such a bitch?

01:23:06.082 --> 01:23:07.848
Yeah.
I think I do!

01:23:09.417 --> 01:23:10.551
Billy.

01:23:13.021 --> 01:23:14.188
She might have
gotten my vote

01:23:14.190 --> 01:23:17.124
but you got my heart.

01:23:17.126 --> 01:23:18.859
Good job.

01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:24.164
Thank you.
Thank you so..

01:23:24.166 --> 01:23:26.367
I know, stop.

01:23:26.369 --> 01:23:27.568
Thank you.

01:23:29.204 --> 01:23:32.706
God wins!
God wins!

01:23:32.708 --> 01:23:35.642
<i>For me, it was never actually
about being the queen.</i>

01:23:35.644 --> 01:23:38.612
<i>It was about showing them
I was worthy.</i>

01:23:40.048 --> 01:23:42.516
<i>And I did.</i>

01:23:42.518 --> 01:23:45.052
<i>And what to my wondering
eyes should appear..</i>

01:23:45.054 --> 01:23:46.120
Billy.

01:23:46.122 --> 01:23:47.154
<i>...but the man
who I thought</i>

01:23:47.156 --> 01:23:49.623
<i>had abandoned me.</i>

01:23:49.625 --> 01:23:51.825
<i>The man who came
to tonight's barbecue</i>

01:23:51.827 --> 01:23:53.694
<i>even though he thought his
little boy was gonna give</i>

01:23:53.696 --> 01:23:55.295
<i>a speech in a dress.</i>

01:23:57.232 --> 01:23:58.665
<i>The man that is..</i>

01:23:58.667 --> 01:23:59.900
Daddy?

01:24:02.137 --> 01:24:04.171
I'm here.

01:24:04.173 --> 01:24:05.439
I'm queer.

01:24:08.043 --> 01:24:09.109
I'll get used to it.

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:16.183
- I lost.
- Are you kidding me?

01:24:16.185 --> 01:24:18.919
That was the biggest win
I've ever seen.

01:24:21.156 --> 01:24:23.057
Look at me.

01:24:23.059 --> 01:24:25.993
I am so proud of you.

01:24:25.995 --> 01:24:27.494
Thank you.

01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:32.499
Mm.

01:24:34.369 --> 01:24:37.671
Come on, son.
Let's go home.

01:24:37.673 --> 01:24:39.106
Yes, sir.

01:24:47.248 --> 01:24:48.615
You know I could have
dodged that tackle

01:24:48.617 --> 01:24:51.385
the other night, right?

01:24:51.387 --> 01:24:54.188
But I realized that i found
something more important than

01:24:54.190 --> 01:24:56.690
than pleasing my dad.

01:24:56.692 --> 01:24:58.292
More important
than football.

01:24:59.861 --> 01:25:01.962
Me.

01:25:01.964 --> 01:25:04.264
I never would have
discovered that without you.

01:25:11.539 --> 01:25:13.507
I'm so sorry I stopped
being your friend.

01:25:15.076 --> 01:25:16.877
It's okay.

01:25:16.879 --> 01:25:18.278
You were just being you.

01:25:19.981 --> 01:25:22.783
Muv was just being muv.

01:25:24.319 --> 01:25:26.487
How about I do me

01:25:26.489 --> 01:25:28.288
and you do you?

01:25:29.557 --> 01:25:31.492
And maybe one day
we can try

01:25:31.494 --> 01:25:34.094
<i>the other way around.</i>

01:25:34.096 --> 01:25:35.229
<i>Deal?</i>

01:25:38.833 --> 01:25:40.100
Nice try.
