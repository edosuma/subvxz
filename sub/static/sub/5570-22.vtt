00:01.569 --> 00:03.371
Previously on Limitless...
BRIAN:
Side effects may include...

00:03.404 --> 00:06.207
Memory loss, extreme paranoia,
approaching psychosis.

00:06.240 --> 00:09.077
Don't know exactly how long
the booster shot's gonna last.

00:09.110 --> 00:11.379
You can't take NZT anymore.

00:11.412 --> 00:14.382
Jarrod Sands and a group of
five or more other people

00:14.415 --> 00:16.184
are holding Piper Baird.
We'll refer to them

00:16.217 --> 00:19.087
as "The Legion of Whom."

00:19.120 --> 00:20.354
He's got a whole supply of it.

00:20.388 --> 00:22.056
You figured out
that I'm the one

00:22.090 --> 00:23.291
that's responsible
for the flood.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.126
I'm looking for Piper Baird.

00:26.327 --> 00:29.063
Rebecca Harris.
Agent Adam Brewster, DEA.

00:29.097 --> 00:30.564
He's our liaison for
this investigation.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.066
Brewster is one of them.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.601
The NZT surge was just
a smokescreen

00:33.634 --> 00:35.469
to create chaos!

00:35.503 --> 00:37.171
All those people he gave up--

00:37.205 --> 00:38.406
they're Morra's people--

00:38.439 --> 00:40.574
the people
who were in Sands' way.

00:40.608 --> 00:42.376
Brewster knew we'd bring all
the co-conspirators

00:42.410 --> 00:44.812
to the CJC for questioning.

00:44.845 --> 00:48.116
Rigged some type of explosive
device beneath their van.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.850
It's a massacre.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.786
So what the hell happens now?

00:52.820 --> 00:56.490
(sirens wailing in distance)

00:56.524 --> 00:58.326
NAZ: Two Corrections officers
are dead,

00:58.359 --> 01:00.294
one U.S. marshal, not to
mention the five people

01:00.328 --> 01:02.263
who were working
for Senator Morra,

01:02.296 --> 01:04.365
who, by the way, is
nowhere to be found.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.100
BRIAN: I understand how
bad things are.

01:06.134 --> 01:08.136
They got a whole bunch of people
on their side

01:08.169 --> 01:09.337
taking NZT,
and they've got Piper there

01:09.370 --> 01:11.705
to make the immunity shot
for them-- you know, I'm just

01:11.739 --> 01:13.574
thinking about
what it is they want.

01:13.607 --> 01:16.210
What they want is
to keep things crazy,

01:16.244 --> 01:19.480
so they can come and go as they
please while we chase our tail.

01:19.513 --> 01:20.881
NAZ: We have activated
every law enforcement

01:20.914 --> 01:24.218
agency in the city, and
we're still overwhelmed.

01:24.252 --> 01:27.355
No, NZT or not, they kicked
our ass on our front yard.

01:27.388 --> 01:28.756
If we think
about what they want,

01:28.789 --> 01:30.591
then we'll probably
get answers...
I am responsible

01:30.624 --> 01:32.226
for these lives;
this happened on my watch.

01:35.463 --> 01:38.266
If you have something to say,
I'd like... I'm listening.

01:38.299 --> 01:41.169
Okay.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.237
If we think about
what they want, what they need,

01:43.271 --> 01:44.838
it might point us in
the right direction.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.274
It might show
us some weakness

01:46.307 --> 01:47.841
or something.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.677
Motive. Fine.
You got ideas?

01:51.279 --> 01:53.681
BRIAN: So Sands has his own team
of super villains.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.486
What are they up to?

01:58.519 --> 02:01.389
First of all,
you lot rescued me from the FBI.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.291
Cheers.

02:03.324 --> 02:06.660
But let's not dwell
on our past successes.

02:06.694 --> 02:08.829
We should talk
about what's next.

02:08.862 --> 02:11.332
I have some thoughts on that.

02:13.234 --> 02:16.537
We should carry out part two
of our evil plan, obviously.

02:16.570 --> 02:19.273
Do you know the premium
on a contractor

02:19.307 --> 02:21.242
who's willing to work
inside a dormant volcano?

02:21.275 --> 02:22.743
BRIAN:
Money.

02:22.776 --> 02:26.614
Sands recruited his team
from the ranks

02:26.647 --> 02:28.782
of Morra's people. I mean, they
might have been doing fine,

02:28.816 --> 02:30.184
but they're lieutenants.

02:30.218 --> 02:32.420
They're not the main players.

02:32.453 --> 02:34.588
So if they want to change
the world on NZT,

02:34.622 --> 02:37.925
they're gonna need a lot of
seed capital to do anything big.

02:37.958 --> 02:40.628
So, yeah, they need money,

02:40.661 --> 02:41.962
and they need a lot
of it, really fast.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.331
Well, they're not
gonna get that

02:43.364 --> 02:44.532
by selling
a few thousand NZT pills.

02:44.565 --> 02:45.933
Exactly.
So, if we can figure out

02:45.966 --> 02:47.801
what it is they're up to,
we find them.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.737
We?

02:51.505 --> 02:55.243
Look, you can take me back
and give me NZT or not.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.710
But either way, there are still
pills out on the street,

02:56.744 --> 02:57.911
and I'll take those
if I have to,

02:57.945 --> 03:01.615
because I'm gonna find Sands,
and I'm gonna find Piper.

03:01.649 --> 03:05.586
Brian, you don't know when
your immunity's gonna run out.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.288
You could die.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.889
I don't care.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.591
And at this point,
neither should you.

03:10.624 --> 03:11.725
I'm immune right now.

03:11.759 --> 03:14.328
I'm all you've got.

03:16.930 --> 03:17.731
NAZ:
Brian, you understand

03:17.765 --> 03:18.932
this is temporary.

03:20.401 --> 03:21.835
In that case...

03:21.869 --> 03:23.771
welcome back to the CJC.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.507
Thanks, boys.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.209
Now let's go get
these sons of bitches.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.719
Find Sands and hope
that leads to Piper.

03:38.752 --> 03:41.489
But there was nothing helpful
at the crime scene.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.828
(woman crying quietly)

03:50.398 --> 03:52.800
(woman crying, louder)

03:54.835 --> 03:57.004
(sobbing)

03:57.037 --> 03:58.972
Piper?

04:00.341 --> 04:02.743
Why are you doing this, Brian?

04:02.776 --> 04:05.346
I've been gone for weeks.

04:06.714 --> 04:08.382
As soon as Sands
and his people figured out

04:08.416 --> 04:09.550
how to make that immunity shot,

04:09.583 --> 04:12.420
do you really believe
they kept me alive?

04:12.453 --> 04:14.888
I have to. You would have done
the exact same thing for me.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.792
Not if it meant dying.

04:18.826 --> 04:19.727
What do you mean?

04:19.760 --> 04:21.429
The side effects.

04:22.463 --> 04:26.400
The hallucinations,
the... paranoia.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.436
They're starting.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.405
(sobbing)

04:31.439 --> 04:33.907
I still have a little
bit of my immunity left.

04:35.843 --> 04:38.879
Hey, I'm gonna
find you.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.351
I'm gone, Brian!

04:43.384 --> 04:45.719
Don't follow me (screams): down!

04:47.788 --> 04:50.791
*

05:11.679 --> 05:13.046
So you all remember
Clay Meeks.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.548
He's the chemist
who released the NZT

05:14.582 --> 05:15.849
onto the streets
of New York.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.851
Well, I spent the morning
digging around

05:17.885 --> 05:20.388
in the cell phones of the people
that Sands had assassinated,

05:20.421 --> 05:23.023
and four out of the five of them
had contact information

05:23.056 --> 05:25.058
for Clay Meeks
hidden away in there.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.065
We've already been
to Meeks' apartment, Finch.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.967
He's in hiding.

05:35.035 --> 05:35.936
JAMES:
Everything okay?

05:37.004 --> 05:39.440
I'm fine, and you're right.

05:39.473 --> 05:41.942
We have been to the apartment
that he has listed.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.978
But one of Morra's people had an
alternate phone number for him,

05:45.012 --> 05:45.979
and that traces back

05:46.013 --> 05:47.948
to a rent-controlled apartment
on Mott Street.

05:47.981 --> 05:51.051
It was leased
to a woman named Mary Wu.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.986
Is she connected to Meeks?
He was raised in foster care,

05:53.020 --> 05:55.088
and Mary Wu was his foster
mother for, like, two years.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.825
Now, Meeks is our one connection
to the Legion of Whom.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.461
I mean, if we want to find out
who they are or where they are,

06:00.494 --> 06:01.662
we gotta bring him in.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.909
All right,
let's assemble a team,

06:15.943 --> 06:17.945
see if he's
holed up in there.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.516
(car door opens)

06:25.118 --> 06:26.487
(sighs)
Nobody answered our knock,

06:26.520 --> 06:28.956
so TAC team's gonna camp out,
see if

06:28.989 --> 06:31.058
Mary Wu comes back.

06:31.091 --> 06:34.094
So, we're gonna be honest with
each other on this one, right?

06:35.663 --> 06:38.966
I can tell you're having
side effects, Brian.

06:38.999 --> 06:42.536
And I can tell
you're trying to hide them.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.905
How bad is it?

06:44.938 --> 06:47.775
Some part of my last immunity
shot is definitely working,

06:47.808 --> 06:52.112
but today, like, this morning,
it started for real.

06:52.145 --> 06:54.982
Now how fast it gets
crazy, I don't know.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.985
Here's something

06:58.018 --> 07:01.489
I need to tell you, though,
if we are being honest.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.591
I'm not gonna stop
taking these pills.

07:03.624 --> 07:06.727
Not until we know where Sands is
and what happened to Piper.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.131
I'll help you cover with Naz.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.534
I'll...

07:13.567 --> 07:15.168
I'll help you any way I can.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.938
BOYLE (over radio):
Have visual on Mary Wu.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.006
She's headed into the building.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.008
Is everyone in place?

07:21.041 --> 07:23.110
AGENT (over radio):
We've got the back covered.

07:23.143 --> 07:24.211
SWAT OFFICER: We're in position
in the building.

07:24.244 --> 07:26.046
Brian?
What?

07:26.079 --> 07:27.915
I understand that this is
important to you,

07:27.948 --> 07:30.217
but the rules still stand.
We've got this.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.022
Mary Wu?

07:35.055 --> 07:36.023
Yes?

07:36.056 --> 07:37.190
We're with the FBI.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.158
We have information
that suggests

07:38.191 --> 07:39.893
a man named Clay Meeks
may be hiding here.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.194
You mind
if we take a look around?

07:41.228 --> 07:42.863
Do you have a warrant?

07:42.896 --> 07:44.898
We can come back
with one, if we have to.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.033
AGENT (over radio):
He's on the fire escape,

07:46.066 --> 07:47.568
heading to the roof!

07:47.601 --> 07:50.237
They're headed to a unit
on the second floor, right?

07:51.071 --> 07:52.606
He just came out
of the back window.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.074
He's heading for the roof!
Go! Go!

07:54.107 --> 07:55.108
AGENT (over radio):
He's on the move!

07:55.142 --> 07:56.209
By Unit Seven!
Go, go, go, go!

07:56.243 --> 07:57.077
Go, go, go!

08:03.250 --> 08:04.785
AGENT: Come on, you guys!
Give me light!

08:04.818 --> 08:05.919
(door smashing open)

08:09.222 --> 08:11.959
AGENT: Clear!
Now get over here! Move!

08:20.901 --> 08:22.069
There he goes.
Freeze, Meeks!

08:22.102 --> 08:23.871
Meeks, stop!

08:33.981 --> 08:35.783
BOYLE:
Don't move!

08:38.185 --> 08:39.152
Clay Meeks!

08:39.186 --> 08:40.621
Make one move, I fire.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.162
MAN (staticky):
We will not be undersold,

08:49.196 --> 08:51.198
no matter what
our competitors say!

08:51.231 --> 08:53.701
WOMAN: Traffic at a standstill
at Midtown this morning.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.936
with some street closures
around the Palace Hotel...

08:55.969 --> 08:57.337
(music playing)

08:57.370 --> 09:01.274
(woman crying under
radio static)

09:01.308 --> 09:02.342
MAN (distant):
Brian Finch...

09:02.375 --> 09:04.778
(overlapping voices)

09:04.812 --> 09:05.979
PIPER (distant): Brian!

09:06.847 --> 09:08.215
Leave me alone.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.249
(distorted): Brian!

09:11.685 --> 09:12.920
You okay?

09:12.953 --> 09:14.955
Yeah.
We got Meeks.

09:19.026 --> 09:19.927
MEEKS: I don't know anything
about a group.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.195
I only dealt with Jarrod Sands,
that's it.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.997
BOYLE:
Oh, that's too bad,

09:24.031 --> 09:25.165
because we have
a federal consultant

09:25.198 --> 09:26.934
that can peg you
as the chemist

09:26.967 --> 09:29.202
who put thousands
of NZT pills on the street.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.203
REBECCA:
People are dying.

09:30.237 --> 09:33.306
Every single body is gonna be
charged to you.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.110
I do remember one thing.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.646
I heard him on the phone

09:38.679 --> 09:41.114
one time, when he came
to visit me in the lab.

09:41.148 --> 09:44.017
He walked away, but I
heard him say a name.

09:44.051 --> 09:46.086
Morneau.

09:46.119 --> 09:49.089
"Everything is in place
for a deal with Morneau."

10:09.142 --> 10:11.378
Jean-Pierre Morneau.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.146
Who's Jean-Pierre Morneau?

10:13.180 --> 10:15.415
I just sifted through
all the Morneaus I can remember.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.885
If we're thinking
"important people,"

10:17.918 --> 10:20.220
there's one Morneau
that jumps out,

10:20.253 --> 10:21.689
and that is Jean-Pierre Morneau,

10:21.722 --> 10:23.156
Secretary of State

10:23.190 --> 10:25.893
of Global Affairs for the
sovereign state of Canada.

10:25.926 --> 10:28.696
Sorry... you think
the Canadian Secretary of State

10:28.729 --> 10:31.298
of Global Affairs is part
of the Legion of Whom?

10:32.365 --> 10:34.634
Why? What use
would they have for him?

10:39.172 --> 10:41.241
What use would we have for you?

10:41.274 --> 10:45.245
That's a terrific question, and
I'm super glad you asked it, eh?

10:45.278 --> 10:47.347
RACHEL:
Brian?

10:47.380 --> 10:48.415
Brian?

10:48.448 --> 10:51.084
Are you with us or what?

10:51.118 --> 10:55.689
Yeah. I just don't know exactly
why they would need Morneau.

10:55.723 --> 10:57.725
But... it's a name.

10:57.758 --> 11:00.060
There are a bunch of Canadian
diplomats in town right now.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.230
Oh, my God,
would you look at that?

11:04.264 --> 11:05.365
Morneau's here.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.968
He's negotiating a treaty
at the UN.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.370
And traffic reports this morning
mentioned congestion

11:10.403 --> 11:12.239
right around the Palace Hotel.

11:12.272 --> 11:15.108
So that's probably where
they're staying.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.409
It's worth a shot.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.811
What do you
guys say?

11:17.845 --> 11:18.979
You want to go talk
to one of the members

11:19.012 --> 11:20.413
of the Legion of Whom?

11:24.017 --> 11:26.186
(horn honks, bell dings,
traffic whooshes)

11:26.219 --> 11:27.855
Sorry, guys. Hotel's off-limits.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.823
We got a situation on our hands.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.158
We're with the FBI.
We need to get through here

11:31.191 --> 11:33.260
to speak to a man named
Jean-Pierre Morneau.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.295
Morneau? Come on in.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.130
Happy to let you guys
do your jobs,

11:37.164 --> 11:38.331
but I don't think
Jean-Pierre Morneau's

11:38.365 --> 11:39.299
gonna be doing much talking.

11:39.332 --> 11:40.367
What do you mean?

11:40.400 --> 11:41.234
I mean...

11:41.268 --> 11:43.170
he's the reason
we're jammed up here.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.171
A guy pried open

11:44.204 --> 11:46.173
a window
on the 16th floor.

11:47.240 --> 11:50.377
Jean-Pierre Morneau died
on impact.

11:50.410 --> 11:53.246
Sorry, guys,
but he's not doing any talking.

12:09.963 --> 12:13.100
(distorted):
Brian?

12:13.133 --> 12:16.103
BOYLE: Finch, why are you
lying down in the middle

12:16.136 --> 12:17.370
of a crime scene?

12:17.404 --> 12:19.940
Sorry. I was just trying to get
a little different perspective.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.843
(clears throat)
Where were we?

12:22.876 --> 12:24.144
No signs of foul play.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.013
And apparently Morneau
was under investigation

12:26.046 --> 12:28.015
for financial improprieties
back home.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.983
Combine that with
a painkiller habit,

12:30.017 --> 12:31.919
and they're chalking
it up to suicide.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.253
Mm. They're wrong.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.755
Just look at those
two vases over there.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.092
So, two vases.

12:39.126 --> 12:40.327
The layers of beads

12:40.360 --> 12:43.030
in the first vase are perfect;
every color is in its place.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.165
In this hotel, symmetry is
a fundamental aesthetic.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.034
But if you look
at the second vase,

12:47.067 --> 12:49.502
there's one bead at the bottom
of the bowl that's out of place.

12:49.536 --> 12:52.105
Matches the beads
in the bowl by the window,

12:52.139 --> 12:53.841
to suggest
that somebody knocked it over

12:53.874 --> 12:55.142
and then tried to put it
back together in a rush.

12:55.175 --> 12:59.046
That's your evidence
of murder?

12:59.079 --> 13:01.514
Yeah. I mean, we're dealing
with people who are on NZT here.

13:01.548 --> 13:04.051
There's not gonna be
any obvious clues.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.086
Jean-Pierre
Morneau--

13:06.119 --> 13:08.288
he's not part of the legion;
he's one of their victims.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.290
We just got to figure out why.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.125
(groans quietly)

13:12.159 --> 13:14.061
We've got to get you out
of here. I'm gonna take you back

13:14.094 --> 13:15.262
to my place,
where I can keep an eye on you.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.198
You know what, there's one more
place I'd rather go first.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.204
(sighs deeply)

13:26.073 --> 13:29.242
Hey. Can we talk?

13:29.276 --> 13:32.379
Out here? You know, the
fresh air feels good.

13:33.413 --> 13:34.381
Yeah, sure.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.883
Let me get a jacket.

13:37.951 --> 13:40.453
BRIAN: I need you to know
why I'm doing this.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.856
I mean, it could be
that Piper's gone,

13:42.890 --> 13:45.392
just like you said,
you know?

13:45.425 --> 13:48.161
But I have to know.

13:48.195 --> 13:51.498
You know, I mean,
I gotta find out for myself.

13:51.531 --> 13:54.034
Right.

13:54.067 --> 13:57.170
But...

13:57.204 --> 14:00.207
at least let me take you
to see a doctor.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.342
Come on.
Just somebody who could help.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.144
Every second that goes by,
I'm less and less immune

14:04.177 --> 14:06.079
to the side effects.

14:06.113 --> 14:08.615
I can't stop looking.
Honestly...

14:08.648 --> 14:10.850
I shouldn't even be here.

14:12.585 --> 14:15.222
I just wanted you to know that
the reason I'm taking the pill

14:15.255 --> 14:16.389
isn't because I'm some junkie.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.059
It's to help people.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.293
That's what it's what it's
always been about, you know?

14:20.327 --> 14:22.295
That's...
what you taught me.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.398
Look, I don't know
when the next time

14:25.432 --> 14:26.533
I'm gonna see you guys again

14:26.566 --> 14:28.936
and... I don't know

14:28.969 --> 14:31.204
what I'm gonna be like
when we do, but...

14:31.238 --> 14:35.008
I need you to know...

14:35.042 --> 14:36.443
I need you to know
that if there's one thing

14:36.476 --> 14:37.577
I regret
over the past year

14:37.610 --> 14:41.081
it's that I lied to you.

14:41.114 --> 14:44.117
And I'm sorry for that.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.421
Listen...

14:51.124 --> 14:52.292
I hope you're right.

14:52.325 --> 14:55.195
I hope this girl is alive.

14:55.228 --> 14:58.098
I hope you find her.

14:58.131 --> 15:00.433
Just be smart,

15:00.467 --> 15:02.602
careful.

15:02.635 --> 15:04.471
And, dear God...

15:04.504 --> 15:06.339
come back to us.

15:20.387 --> 15:21.354
You okay?

15:21.388 --> 15:22.689
Yeah.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.324
I'm in a good patch right now.

15:24.357 --> 15:25.959
I mean,
I don't know for how long,

15:25.993 --> 15:27.194
but right now, I'm good, yeah.

15:27.227 --> 15:29.129
Beer o'clock?

15:29.162 --> 15:30.597
I thought
it would help you relax.
Thank you.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.432
I'm in the next room.
I thought we could just rest

15:32.465 --> 15:34.367
for a couple of hours
and then get back to work.

15:34.401 --> 15:36.403
Yeah. Sounds good.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.609
BRIAN: Honestly,
I could've used the rest.

15:42.642 --> 15:45.145
But since I knew
it wasn't going to come anyway,

15:45.178 --> 15:48.248
I figured maybe there was a way
I could do some good.

16:05.065 --> 16:07.067
(echoing):
Brian...?

16:09.302 --> 16:11.304
Brian.

16:14.774 --> 16:17.144
What did you do?

16:18.311 --> 16:20.613
Oh, um...

16:20.647 --> 16:22.382
It was a productive night.

16:22.415 --> 16:23.283
I don't have it
all figured out,

16:23.316 --> 16:25.318
but there's a lot
I need to tell you.

16:25.352 --> 16:28.088
Did you take another NZT pill?

16:28.121 --> 16:30.223
This isn't a really
a "one shift on, one
shift off" kind of deal.

16:30.257 --> 16:32.025
And to be honest with you,
I lost a little bit of time

16:32.059 --> 16:33.426
right there, but I feel
pretty good right now,

16:33.460 --> 16:35.162
so if you want to sit down
or stand up, doesn't matter,

16:35.195 --> 16:38.631
whatever you want, just focus,
'cause we got to talk about
the Northwest Territories.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.468
You mean of Canada?
Yes.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.803
Specifically, we're interested
in the Cantana Ice Shelf,

16:43.836 --> 16:46.373
which Canada shares
with its neighbor to the east.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.575
The proud--
I assume, anyway--

16:48.608 --> 16:51.178
and recently fully
sovereign nation of Greenland.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.347
Now, in the next few years,
it is a lock

16:54.381 --> 16:56.216
that the Cantana Ice Shelf
will split

16:56.249 --> 16:59.419
right down the middle--
climate change and all that.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.221
Now, it's a disaster
for the planet,

17:01.254 --> 17:03.056
obviously,
but in the short term,

17:03.090 --> 17:04.457
(whispers):
it's great for business.

17:04.491 --> 17:05.392
How so?
Well,

17:05.425 --> 17:07.827
once the ice shelf splits,
it'll open up

17:07.860 --> 17:09.529
a new navigable waterway--

17:09.562 --> 17:12.099
the long sought-after
Northwest Passage.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.801
Boats will have
an alternate route...

17:14.834 --> 17:17.137
to travel across the Americas.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.571
So shipping companies

17:18.605 --> 17:20.373
won't have to use
the Panama Canal anymore.

17:20.407 --> 17:22.442
Yes. It cuts the rides
from Japan to London

17:22.475 --> 17:24.377
by, like, 5,000 miles--
it's a game-changer

17:24.411 --> 17:26.346
Billions upon billions
of dollars are at stake,

17:26.379 --> 17:28.115
but there's a little bit
of an argument

17:28.148 --> 17:29.682
about who the new passage
belongs to.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.352
Canada says it's theirs;
Greenland begs to differ.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.654
So whoever owns the rights
to the waterways

17:34.687 --> 17:37.124
gets to decide the rules
for how it's used.

17:37.157 --> 17:40.360
And Jean-Pierre Morneau,
our dead Canadian diplomat,

17:40.393 --> 17:43.196
was in town negotiating treaties
for the new waterway.

17:43.230 --> 17:44.497
And the person
making negotiations

17:44.531 --> 17:46.499
on Greenland's side's name
is Andrew Inouye,

17:46.533 --> 17:48.401
and he's ready to talk turkey.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.337
I mean, he thinks
they should share--

17:50.370 --> 17:51.504
both countries get richer.

17:51.538 --> 17:52.672
And Jean-Pierre Morneau?

17:52.705 --> 17:55.375
He is-- uh, sorry-- was...

17:55.408 --> 17:58.345
an absolutely nutso
radical Canadian nationalist.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.813
He is adamant
about not sharing the spoils.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.682
But now that
he's dead--

18:02.715 --> 18:05.652
by supposed suicide--
all of that is gonna change.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.220
Why?

18:07.254 --> 18:09.122
Because Deputy Secretary
of State, Christine Poule,

18:09.156 --> 18:12.325
she's the next in line,
and she's all about the treaty.

18:12.359 --> 18:13.860
So... once the deal is in place,

18:13.893 --> 18:16.396
the Legion of Whom... what?

18:16.429 --> 18:19.599
That's the one piece I don't
completely have figured out.

18:19.632 --> 18:22.169
Okay. And we still don't have
any evidence that Morneau

18:22.202 --> 18:24.137
was pushed out
of his hotel window.

18:24.171 --> 18:25.572
And we could look
into the possibility

18:25.605 --> 18:26.839
that Christine Poule,
heir apparent

18:26.873 --> 18:28.608
to the Canadian side
of the negotiations,

18:28.641 --> 18:30.777
is herself a member
of the Legion of Whom.

18:32.645 --> 18:35.815
BRIAN: Good morning,
Canadians and, um...

18:35.848 --> 18:37.684
Greenlanders.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.486
First of all, let me
commend you on your decision

18:39.519 --> 18:40.787
to press forward
with treaty negotiations,

18:40.820 --> 18:43.256
despite yesterday's tragic loss.

18:43.290 --> 18:46.159
My colleague
Rebecca Harris
and I are here

18:46.193 --> 18:48.161
on a mission of goodwill
from the FBI.

18:48.195 --> 18:49.196
See?

18:49.229 --> 18:51.598
We even brought you donuts.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.171
INOUYE: Are you all right?
You look like

18:58.205 --> 18:59.706
you could use some rest.

18:59.739 --> 19:00.907
Andrew Inouye!

19:00.940 --> 19:02.108
Willing to ask
the tough questions.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.811
I can see why they call you
"Greenland's favorite son."

19:04.844 --> 19:08.715
What exactly does the FBI have
to do with this negotiation?

19:18.958 --> 19:20.960
(distorted, becoming clear):
...Christine Poule is spotless.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.629
I mean, not like
a weird spotless,

19:22.662 --> 19:24.764
like doctored up, she is...
Wait, what
just happened?

19:26.333 --> 19:27.900
What are you talking about?
I mean,

19:27.934 --> 19:29.836
we were just standing
in a conference room at the U.N.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.304
How the hell did we get here?

19:32.339 --> 19:34.807
That was, like, three hours ago.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.278
You lifted
Christine Poule's phone.

19:38.311 --> 19:39.812
We've been going through it.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.882
She's clean.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.884
It's getting worse, Brian.

19:46.286 --> 19:47.287
Do you want to keep going?

19:47.320 --> 19:48.488
Yeah.
Even if this works

19:48.521 --> 19:49.456
long enough for you
to find out what happened

19:49.489 --> 19:51.324
to Piper, you're still
gonna have to come down

19:51.358 --> 19:53.493
off of NZT,
and without the booster...

19:53.526 --> 19:55.595
Hey. James Tech is asking
for you guys. Right now.

19:56.896 --> 19:59.432
Okay, so you asked me
to look for evidence

19:59.466 --> 20:01.868
that would link shady parties
to buying up

20:01.901 --> 20:04.271
shipping and construction stocks
that would benefit

20:04.304 --> 20:06.873
from the opening
of a new Northwest Passage.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.808
Please tell me
there's a smoking gun.

20:08.841 --> 20:11.744
Kind of the opposite, actually.
There's definitely been

20:11.778 --> 20:13.613
an uptick in trading
since word got out

20:13.646 --> 20:14.947
that the treaty was likely.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.584
But as far as
I can tell, all that

20:17.617 --> 20:19.819
is completely legitimate.

20:19.852 --> 20:22.289
Considering that there's going
to be a new Northwest Passage,

20:22.322 --> 20:24.591
and it looks like the treaty's
going to go through,

20:24.624 --> 20:26.459
you would think that
all the smart money

20:26.493 --> 20:27.827
would be pouring into companies

20:27.860 --> 20:28.728
that would benefit
from the deal.

20:28.761 --> 20:31.498
But there's a surprising
amount of activity

20:31.531 --> 20:33.933
shorting the stocks
to those companies,

20:33.966 --> 20:35.502
all of it from a series

20:35.535 --> 20:38.371
of borderline-to-fully-shady
shell companies.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.507
That doesn't make sense.

20:40.540 --> 20:43.276
Sands and his people are banking
on the treaty failing?

20:43.310 --> 20:44.777
They killed Jean-Pierre Morneau,

20:44.811 --> 20:46.012
who was making sure

20:46.045 --> 20:47.013
that the treaty doesn't happen.

20:47.046 --> 20:50.116
Why would they do that,
if they want it to fail?

20:53.986 --> 20:55.922
Is my daughter safe?

20:55.955 --> 20:57.757
She's just fine.

20:57.790 --> 21:00.693
As long as you do your job,
she'll stay that way.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.296
I'm ready.

21:03.330 --> 21:06.933
As long as you promise
to keep Amelia safe, I'm ready.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.635
Good.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.303
Just to make sure
there's no mistakes.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.939
Like I don't know the guy?

21:12.972 --> 21:16.008
I need to hear you say it, mate.

21:16.042 --> 21:18.645
By this time tomorrow,

21:18.678 --> 21:20.613
Andrew Inouye will be dead.

21:28.388 --> 21:29.722
*

21:37.096 --> 21:39.031
MIKE: Are you sure you're up
for taking that?

21:42.669 --> 21:44.637
IKE:
We're here for you, man.

21:44.671 --> 21:45.938
Anything you need.

21:52.912 --> 21:53.946
(exhales)

22:02.789 --> 22:03.790
See my point?

22:03.823 --> 22:05.057
Not even remotely.

22:05.091 --> 22:06.926
What I can see is
that it's obvious

22:06.959 --> 22:08.595
your immunity is wearing off.

22:08.628 --> 22:10.563
Sands and his people
aren't trying to make money

22:10.597 --> 22:12.064
by investing in Canadian
infrastructure.

22:12.098 --> 22:13.700
That would take years.

22:13.733 --> 22:15.768
They want people to think
the treaty's gonna go through,

22:15.802 --> 22:17.970
so that they can create
a market bubble.

22:18.004 --> 22:20.407
REBECCA: So they murder
Jean-Pierre Morneau

22:20.440 --> 22:22.008
and they make everyone
think that the treaty's

22:22.041 --> 22:23.676
gonna happen.
Exactly.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.612
And once they've
inflated the bubble,

22:25.645 --> 22:28.448
the legion
shorts those stocks....

22:28.481 --> 22:30.817
and then they pop the bubble,
making a massive--

22:30.850 --> 22:33.085
and, most importantly,
instant-- fortune.

22:33.119 --> 22:34.286
Thank you.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.956
So they make everyone think
the treaty's gonna happen...

22:36.989 --> 22:38.691
and then they kill it?

22:38.725 --> 22:40.827
Yeah, well, how do they do that?
BRIAN: Fair question.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.462
Now, they've already monkeyed
with the Canadian side.

22:42.495 --> 22:44.130
But if they're looking to kill
it from Greenland's end,

22:44.163 --> 22:46.866
their best bet
is to go after this guy.

22:48.067 --> 22:49.268
Andrew Inouye.

22:49.301 --> 22:51.738
He helped the country negotiate
its sovereignty from Denmark,

22:51.771 --> 22:54.006
and everybody says that,
after this deal goes through,

22:54.040 --> 22:55.174
he's gonna be prime minister.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.677
So you think he's a target?
Let's say you take him out.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.846
Maybe even attribute it
to Canadian nationalists

22:59.879 --> 23:02.615
trying to squash the treaty,
and then, bam!

23:02.649 --> 23:05.485
Deal's over, kaput.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.820
And Sands and his buddies
make a few billion

23:07.854 --> 23:09.021
when the bubble pops.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.423
(pops)

23:10.457 --> 23:13.059
You think I'm a target?

23:13.092 --> 23:14.861
Well, we'd like to take
you into protective custody

23:14.894 --> 23:17.196
immediately,
just to be safe.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.131
I have a delegated
security team.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.537
Sir, with respect
to your team, the FBI

23:24.571 --> 23:26.439
wouldn't be here if we didn't
think this was a credible threat

23:26.473 --> 23:28.475
to the safety
of you and your family.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.649
All right, I'll go with you.

23:36.683 --> 23:38.951
I need to call my wife,
let her know about this.

23:40.086 --> 23:40.987
BRIAN: Huh.

23:41.020 --> 23:44.156
Elevated heart rate.

23:44.190 --> 23:45.958
Sweating.

23:45.992 --> 23:47.460
Frequent blinking.

23:47.494 --> 23:49.161
I, uh-- Rebecca!

23:49.195 --> 23:50.162
Rebecca! Re--
BOYLE: Sir!

23:50.196 --> 23:51.664
MAN: For country!

23:52.765 --> 23:54.501
(man grunts)
No!

23:54.534 --> 23:56.135
(man yells)

23:59.839 --> 24:00.873
REBECCA:
Gordon Cooker.

24:00.907 --> 24:05.044
He was the only Canadian
on Inouye's security team.

24:05.077 --> 24:06.946
He donated money to
nationalist causes in the past,

24:06.979 --> 24:09.516
but somebody doctored up
his record to get him in clean.

24:09.549 --> 24:11.518
Andrew Inouye died
on the way to the hospital.

24:11.551 --> 24:13.185
BOYLE:
Sands and his people--

24:13.219 --> 24:15.755
they did it; they did it
right in front of us.

24:15.788 --> 24:17.490
Yeah, but not exactly
the way they wanted to.

24:17.524 --> 24:19.959
Cooker only shot Andrew Inouye
in front of us because we were

24:19.992 --> 24:22.028
bringing him into custody--
he's not some radical Canadian

24:22.061 --> 24:24.997
nationalist, he is a patsy,
and our one connection to Piper.

24:26.098 --> 24:27.567
Your daughter, Amelia--

24:27.600 --> 24:29.201
she hasn't
been in school in a week,

24:29.235 --> 24:31.771
and she hasn't posted anything
on social media.

24:33.039 --> 24:35.007
He has her, doesn't he?

24:35.041 --> 24:36.943
Jarrod Sands?

24:36.976 --> 24:38.177
I don't know
what you're talking about.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.079
My daughter's visiting
with relatives.

24:40.112 --> 24:43.950
Do you think
these guys play fair?

24:43.983 --> 24:46.185
They have somebody
that I care about, too.

24:46.218 --> 24:48.921
And the only way
I'm ever gonna see her again

24:48.955 --> 24:50.823
is because I take her back.

24:50.857 --> 24:53.125
REBECCA:
Mr. Cooker, if these
people have your daughter,

24:53.159 --> 24:54.994
your best shot
at getting her back

24:55.027 --> 24:56.663
is to tell us
everything you know

24:56.696 --> 24:57.864
about your dealings with Sands.

25:01.100 --> 25:02.501
(sighs heavily)

25:09.208 --> 25:11.544
We've met face-to-face
only once.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.214
And that was last night.

25:15.247 --> 25:16.849
What else can you tell us?

25:18.117 --> 25:21.053
He was wearing a jacket.

25:21.087 --> 25:23.155
It was on
the Williamsburg Bridge.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.191
What do you want?

25:25.224 --> 25:27.794
I can't remember anything else.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.534
You might remember
more than you think.

25:38.638 --> 25:40.673
Yeah.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.141
Yeah, I...

25:42.174 --> 25:44.944
I've heard about these
on the news.

25:47.346 --> 25:49.916
I take that, you're gonna
help me get Amelia back?

25:52.785 --> 25:55.021
Just another meeting on
the Williamsburg Bridge, right?

25:55.054 --> 25:56.155
But here's the thing--

25:56.188 --> 25:58.357
once we gave Gordon Cooker NZT,
the first thing he was

25:58.390 --> 26:00.827
able to do was triangulate
where his daughter's being kept.

26:00.860 --> 26:03.262
NYPD said they have Amelia,
she's safe and sound.

26:03.295 --> 26:04.330
So, nice work. What else?

26:04.363 --> 26:05.998
Well, he also remembered
two things about that night

26:06.032 --> 26:07.333
that Sands couldn't
possibly have counted on.

26:07.366 --> 26:09.368
In the first one,
there was an unusual smell

26:09.401 --> 26:10.737
coming from the mud
on Sands' boots.

26:10.770 --> 26:12.171
He said it smelled like
a mixture

26:12.204 --> 26:14.006
of salt and fresh water.

26:14.040 --> 26:16.008
And there's only one spot
in the entire city

26:16.042 --> 26:18.244
where brackish water
occurs naturally,

26:18.277 --> 26:19.979
and that is the marshes
of Inwood Hill Park.

26:20.012 --> 26:21.748
Now, Cooker also remembered

26:21.781 --> 26:24.250
a white, pear-shaped
flower blossom

26:24.283 --> 26:26.085
clinging to Sands' jacket.

26:26.118 --> 26:28.320
That comes from
the black locust trees.

26:28.354 --> 26:29.756
Those are very rare
in Manhattan.

26:29.789 --> 26:31.257
In fact, there's only
a few clusters

26:31.290 --> 26:32.258
growing in and around
Inwood Hill Park.

26:32.291 --> 26:33.826
Two blocks southeast

26:33.860 --> 26:36.195
there's a chemical refinery
plant owned by a man

26:36.228 --> 26:37.997
named Athon Jasper.
It's a block away

26:38.030 --> 26:40.700
from a grove
of black locust trees.

26:40.733 --> 26:42.368
You two did it. You found
their NZT refinery.

26:42.401 --> 26:44.837
So if Sands is on the run,
for all we know,

26:44.871 --> 26:46.072
he could be holed up there.

26:46.105 --> 26:47.774
I'll mobilize an HRT team.

26:47.807 --> 26:50.209
We need to move now.

26:50.242 --> 26:52.244
Brian, we've got this.

26:52.278 --> 26:53.345
Nope. I'm coming with you.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.185
(tires screech, siren whoops)

27:04.123 --> 27:05.124
You all right?
Just go.

27:05.157 --> 27:06.358
Go, go, go, go, I'm fine.

27:06.392 --> 27:07.960
(helicopter hovering)

27:10.963 --> 27:13.065
Down! Everybody down!
Down! FBI!

27:13.099 --> 27:15.201
To the left!
Stop moving!

27:15.234 --> 27:17.236
All right, take it easy!
I'm down, I'm down!

27:17.269 --> 27:18.337
Where's the lab?
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

27:18.370 --> 27:19.605
Don't lie to me. Don't
lie to me. Where's the lab?

27:19.638 --> 27:21.340
FOREMAN: What the hell's going--
What are you talking about, man?

27:21.373 --> 27:22.408
BOYLE:
Where's the lab?

27:22.441 --> 27:23.409
FOREMAN: I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

27:23.442 --> 27:24.176
BOYLE: You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

27:24.210 --> 27:26.412
Where is this lab?
Where's the lab?

27:26.445 --> 27:28.114
Boyle!

27:28.147 --> 27:29.315
There's something
up here.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.283
What's behind that panel?
It's a panel!

27:31.317 --> 27:32.318
Open it up.
Open it!

27:32.351 --> 27:32.952
Open it up.
Open it!

27:32.985 --> 27:33.820
There's nothing back there!

27:33.853 --> 27:34.687
What are you talking about?
BOYLE: C4.

27:34.721 --> 27:37.323
In my platoon,
we had an expression:

27:37.356 --> 27:38.324
There's no problem
that couldn't be solved

27:38.357 --> 27:41.794
without the proper application
of explosives.

27:43.029 --> 27:45.264
Wait, wait, wait!

27:45.297 --> 27:47.199
Everything back there
is highly unstable.

28:02.882 --> 28:04.884
Don't move!
BOYLE: Hands up!

28:04.917 --> 28:05.885
MAN:
Okay, all right!

28:07.787 --> 28:09.255
(alarm blaring)

28:10.122 --> 28:11.423
Get down! Go, go!

28:30.409 --> 28:33.145
I'll find Sands.
You get Piper.

28:33.179 --> 28:35.982
(alarm continuing)

28:36.015 --> 28:37.817
Drop your weapon now!

28:37.850 --> 28:41.420
We both know the FBI is always
interested in the bigger fish.

28:42.421 --> 28:43.455
That's Senator Morra.

28:43.489 --> 28:46.358
You had a deal to help us
take Senator Morra down.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.027
Instead you tried
to replace him.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.830
As far as the FBI
is concerned,

28:50.863 --> 28:52.431
you are the big fish.

29:03.943 --> 29:06.913
BRIAN: Side effects or not,
this is it.

29:06.946 --> 29:08.981
This is the
The Legion of Whom's hideout.

29:09.015 --> 29:11.150
Sands and his people
are inside.

29:11.183 --> 29:13.820
Am I supposed to just sit by
and watch all this happen?

29:13.853 --> 29:17.023
I'm not saying I'm the
superhero of the story, per se.

29:17.056 --> 29:19.859
But maybe it's time
to act like one.

29:19.892 --> 29:22.995
SuperBrian? BrianPool?

29:23.029 --> 29:24.463
The Brunisher?

29:25.131 --> 29:26.165
Wolverian?

29:32.104 --> 29:33.806
Huh. The Brunisher.

29:33.840 --> 29:34.974
That's actually not bad.

29:36.909 --> 29:38.310
I could figure out
a name later.

29:38.344 --> 29:40.913
Right now,
I had to save Piper.

29:49.188 --> 29:51.423
But the truth is
I'm not a superhero.

29:51.457 --> 29:52.992
And Sands and his men,

29:53.025 --> 29:54.026
they're probably not
wearing capes either.

29:54.060 --> 29:55.161
They're real.

29:55.194 --> 29:56.195
Killing real people.

29:56.228 --> 29:57.563
And in the real world,

29:57.596 --> 29:59.598
bad guys win

29:59.631 --> 30:01.133
and good guys die.

30:01.167 --> 30:02.869
BOYLE: Brian, what are
you doing here?

30:02.902 --> 30:05.004
This is where
they held her!
Is she...?

30:05.037 --> 30:06.906
She's gone!

30:06.939 --> 30:08.908
(gunshots)

30:08.941 --> 30:10.209
Rebecca.

30:14.246 --> 30:15.447
(gunshot)

30:16.382 --> 30:18.384
Throw your gun on the ground.

30:22.421 --> 30:25.157
One of us is on
NZT, Rebecca.

30:25.191 --> 30:27.159
The other has
one bullet left.

30:27.193 --> 30:28.861
I'd let you do
the math, but...

30:28.895 --> 30:29.962
I'll take my chances.

30:29.996 --> 30:32.564
You murdered my father,
you murdered Morra's people.

30:32.598 --> 30:35.167
You aren't gonna
kill anyone else.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.112
(door opens)

31:01.360 --> 31:04.363
(helicopter flying past,
sirens wailing)

31:04.396 --> 31:07.166
(indistinct radio
communication)

31:11.337 --> 31:13.572
Jarrod Sands is on his way
to the hospital.

31:13.605 --> 31:15.341
They're not sure
he's gonna make it.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.209
They destroyed some of the
facility during the raid,

31:17.243 --> 31:19.278
but not all of it--
we're gonna learn a lot

31:19.311 --> 31:21.313
about these people
and how they operate.

31:23.649 --> 31:26.085
It's a win, Brian.

31:26.118 --> 31:27.519
That's because of you.

31:27.553 --> 31:28.654
Well done.

31:34.526 --> 31:36.028
I couldn't save her.

31:37.696 --> 31:40.466
They made Piper
create the immunity shot.

31:43.169 --> 31:45.671
She's gone.

31:45.704 --> 31:47.906
I'm sorry.

31:50.709 --> 31:52.711
I need to say
\something to you

31:52.744 --> 31:54.480
as a friend.

31:55.747 --> 31:58.184
You have to stop.

31:58.217 --> 31:59.318
Your immunity is gone.

31:59.351 --> 32:00.987
She wouldn't want
you to take a pill.

32:01.020 --> 32:02.989
I don't want you
to take a pill.

32:05.992 --> 32:08.560
Let me give you a ride home.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.105
(grunts in pain)

32:30.349 --> 32:32.384
(sighs heavily)

32:32.418 --> 32:34.420
So what's gonna happen
to me now?

32:35.754 --> 32:38.290
Our medical team is
expecting you at the hospital

32:38.324 --> 32:41.060
to... help you through
the withdrawal.

32:41.093 --> 32:42.995
Mm-hmm.

32:43.029 --> 32:46.098
If you want, I-I can wait,
and I can drive you.

32:46.132 --> 32:47.733
No. My parents can.

32:47.766 --> 32:49.268
I think they probably want to.

32:51.037 --> 32:54.373
Pack socks in case
you have to stay.

32:54.406 --> 32:56.008
Pack socks?

32:56.042 --> 32:57.009
Hospital floors--
they're cold.

32:57.043 --> 32:58.610
They're cold and germy.

32:58.644 --> 33:00.212
Oh.

33:00.246 --> 33:02.014
Thank you.

33:03.449 --> 33:05.617
Hey, I've been so worried
about what I'm gonna do

33:05.651 --> 33:06.685
now that all this is over,

33:06.718 --> 33:08.087
I didn't stop to think
about you.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.022
Oh, my God,
I know, right?

33:10.056 --> 33:11.790
How am I gonna fill my days,

33:11.823 --> 33:14.226
now that I don't have
to look after you?

33:14.260 --> 33:15.427
(coughs)
Right.

33:15.461 --> 33:16.628
(clears his throat)

33:16.662 --> 33:18.397
I'll manage.

33:21.733 --> 33:25.071
I...

33:25.104 --> 33:28.407
I didn't care about
you because I had to.

33:29.741 --> 33:32.378
I mean, it took me a while
to get over your metal music,

33:32.411 --> 33:34.346
and your arts and
crafts, and your...

33:34.380 --> 33:36.448
sweaters with
animals on them.

33:36.482 --> 33:38.150
You don't like animals
on my sweaters?

33:38.184 --> 33:40.052
No, not all of them, but...

33:40.086 --> 33:42.054
(sniffles)

33:42.088 --> 33:44.323
...you're more mature

33:44.356 --> 33:48.727
emotionally and morally than
just about anyone I know.

33:53.265 --> 33:55.801
You're a hero,
on or off the pill.

33:55.834 --> 33:57.569
You.

33:59.605 --> 34:02.408
I don't really feel
like a hero right now.

34:02.441 --> 34:05.544
Everything's gonna be fine.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.349
But if ever it isn't...

34:10.382 --> 34:13.085
I'll be here.

34:15.454 --> 34:16.855
Thanks.

34:16.888 --> 34:19.325
Thank you.
For everything.

34:20.792 --> 34:22.794
(sighs)

34:26.798 --> 34:28.800
(door shuts)

34:41.680 --> 34:43.649
(sighs)

34:43.682 --> 34:46.685
(laughter, indistinct chatter
in distance)

34:51.457 --> 34:53.292
DENNIS:
That's nice...

34:58.264 --> 34:59.631
(sighs) Piper?

35:03.869 --> 35:06.172
Hey. Hey, Brian.

35:06.205 --> 35:08.274
I was just

35:08.307 --> 35:10.509
catching up with Piper.

35:10.542 --> 35:14.146
And as happy as I am
to see her, I can only imagine

35:14.180 --> 35:16.848
how happy you are to see her.

35:16.882 --> 35:17.916
Actually,
she was telling me some things

35:17.949 --> 35:20.886
about you that I didn't know.

35:20.919 --> 35:23.155
Like how you saved her life

35:23.189 --> 35:24.923
on any number
of occasions.

35:24.956 --> 35:27.593
And some other things,

35:27.626 --> 35:30.296
which I know
she's gonna catch you up on.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.867
How?

35:42.341 --> 35:44.376
Oh, my God, Brian.

35:44.410 --> 35:46.412
I'm okay.

35:47.413 --> 35:48.947
I'm okay.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.183
How are, how are you okay?

35:51.217 --> 35:53.619
How are you here?

35:53.652 --> 35:55.587
(laughs)

35:55.621 --> 35:57.856
I stayed alive by making them
think they needed me.

35:57.889 --> 36:00.259
I'd mix up how
I made the enzyme each time,

36:00.292 --> 36:02.228
so they never knew
what they really needed.

36:02.261 --> 36:04.763
And then,
when you brought the FBI, I...

36:04.796 --> 36:06.898
took advantage of the chaos.

36:06.932 --> 36:09.601
I grabbed the batch
I'd been working on, and then

36:09.635 --> 36:11.403
I ran.

36:11.437 --> 36:13.405
Why?

36:13.439 --> 36:15.507
We were there to save you.

36:17.543 --> 36:20.246
I have something-- something...

36:20.279 --> 36:22.981
I don't want the government
to get their hands on, but I...

36:23.014 --> 36:24.683
brought it here for you.

36:24.716 --> 36:26.785
(sighs)

36:30.856 --> 36:32.224
(sighs)

36:35.461 --> 36:37.496
Is that a booster shot?

36:37.529 --> 36:40.266
I figured out
how to make it permanent.

36:40.299 --> 36:42.401
When I give you this, you'll...

36:42.434 --> 36:46.204
be immune to the side effects
of NZT... forever.

36:49.441 --> 36:52.244
But you can't stay.

36:52.278 --> 36:53.945
I don't want the FBI
to have this.

36:53.979 --> 36:55.881
I don't want any government
to have this.

36:55.914 --> 36:58.684
Oh, I can't believe you're here.

36:58.717 --> 36:59.785
(laughs quietly)

36:59.818 --> 37:02.988
Oh, I can't believe
you know I live with my parents.

37:03.021 --> 37:05.957
Honestly, it's... it's not
the biggest surprise of my life.

37:05.991 --> 37:08.260
Great.
(laughs)

37:08.294 --> 37:09.628
If you'll let me, I'd...

37:09.661 --> 37:12.464
like to make you even more
special than you already are.

37:14.032 --> 37:16.968
If anyone in this world
deserves NZT...

37:17.002 --> 37:18.637
it's you.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.410
Are you ready?

37:24.443 --> 37:26.445
Yeah.
(laughs)

37:34.320 --> 37:37.389
*

37:58.710 --> 38:00.712
*

38:02.080 --> 38:03.649
(sighs)
Hi.

38:04.683 --> 38:06.585
New jacket?

38:06.618 --> 38:09.955
It is. Yeah.

38:09.988 --> 38:12.758
I don't know, I just
figured that if I am
starting back at the CJC,

38:12.791 --> 38:15.060
then I should probably stop
dressing like I hate the place.

38:16.428 --> 38:18.630
Because I don't.

38:18.664 --> 38:20.399
You guys are okay.

38:20.432 --> 38:21.833
Hm.

38:23.702 --> 38:26.538
So, am I getting
my old job back?

38:28.674 --> 38:30.709
There are a lot
of bad guys out there, Brian,

38:30.742 --> 38:32.444
who know how to make NZT.

38:32.478 --> 38:34.946
And we don't know what's
going on with Senator Morra.

38:34.980 --> 38:37.015
I'm the only game in town.

38:37.048 --> 38:38.984
Right.

38:39.017 --> 38:42.688
DC's walking on egg shells.

38:42.721 --> 38:46.792
They haven't said you're not
allowed to consult with us.

38:48.394 --> 38:50.095
They've actually offered us
more resources.

38:50.128 --> 38:51.663
What does that mean?

38:51.697 --> 38:54.933
They're detailing a squad
to help us do our work.

38:54.966 --> 38:57.068
A squad?

38:57.102 --> 38:59.971
You just said we're gonna
get a secret squad.

39:00.005 --> 39:03.975
You are going to help
me and Boyle with our work.

39:04.009 --> 39:06.144
Do not let this go to your head.

39:06.177 --> 39:07.746
Come on. Never.

39:07.779 --> 39:09.815
You know me
better than that.

39:11.182 --> 39:14.352
Squad goals...

39:19.658 --> 39:21.660
*

39:27.198 --> 39:30.101
Here we have a wild
Spelman Boyle

39:30.135 --> 39:32.504
working away in his
natural habitat,

39:32.538 --> 39:34.840
majestic as he
is industrious.

39:34.873 --> 39:37.809
Tell us, Spelman, why do
you make a good addition

39:37.843 --> 39:40.746
to the Brian Finch Crime Squad,
which is also amazing?

39:40.779 --> 39:43.482
You know I'm
your boss, right?

39:43.515 --> 39:45.851
I've already got
the job, Finch.
I'm your boss.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.886
I'm not interviewing
for a damn thing.

39:47.919 --> 39:50.021
That's not true, dude.
I'm serious.
(chuckles)

39:50.055 --> 39:52.458
They told me that we're equals;
we're partners now.

39:52.491 --> 39:55.561
Wait, what?
Yeah.

39:55.594 --> 39:57.429
Brian, I'm the one
that got you this team.

39:57.463 --> 39:59.898
I know, but how disappointed
would you be if I didn't do

39:59.931 --> 40:02.033
my due diligence
with each applicant?

40:02.067 --> 40:03.168
I am not applying.

40:03.201 --> 40:06.071
I would bring a strong knowledge
of cooperative strategy.

40:06.104 --> 40:10.542
Example: last week, my D&D group
was able to kill the goblin king

40:10.576 --> 40:13.445
by wearing the faces
of his slain goblin soldiers

40:13.479 --> 40:15.481
as a disguise.

40:15.514 --> 40:17.115
My idea.

40:17.148 --> 40:19.084
Technically, I should be
the one auditioning you

40:19.117 --> 40:22.120
to see if I want any of you
to be on my team.

40:22.153 --> 40:24.856
Because you'd be damn lucky
to have me.

40:26.191 --> 40:28.927
That is a really great shirt,
though.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.128
Hey. I'm Mundt.

40:30.161 --> 40:33.599
I've been working the battering
ram for you all year long.

40:33.632 --> 40:35.634
Not that you've noticed.

40:35.667 --> 40:37.503
Of course you need Stavros.

40:38.870 --> 40:40.706
I'm just thrilled
you still have my number.

40:40.739 --> 40:43.041
'Cause sometimes you pop
into my head and I think,

40:43.074 --> 40:44.843
"Where's that Brian guy
right now?

40:44.876 --> 40:48.046
"What's he getting into?
Is he happy?

40:48.079 --> 40:51.149
What sort of underwear
is he wearing?" You know?

40:51.182 --> 40:52.684
(Slavic accent):
I am knowing things.

40:52.718 --> 40:55.020
Every team needs person
who knows things,

40:55.053 --> 40:56.021
and that person is me.

40:56.054 --> 40:59.024
You know, to set things up
for rest of team.

40:59.057 --> 41:01.593
God forbid some wet work
comes along--

41:01.627 --> 41:03.261
I'm your guy.

41:03.294 --> 41:07.566
Just let's say I know my way
around a length of piano wire.

41:07.599 --> 41:09.835
I'm sure
I'd bring a lot to the team.

41:09.868 --> 41:12.270
But I'm the CEO
of Manchester-Reid now.

41:12.303 --> 41:15.473
I don't think you can afford me.

41:16.742 --> 41:18.910
W-Wait, uh, what'd
you just say?

41:18.944 --> 41:21.212
We're not gonna be
bodyguards anymore?

41:21.246 --> 41:22.848
BRIAN:
You're in.

41:22.881 --> 41:24.215
You're gonna be working cases.

41:24.249 --> 41:25.851
Real cases.

41:28.587 --> 41:30.055
Yep...
Yep...

41:31.322 --> 41:34.826
Uh, all right, but no
more "Mike and Ike."

41:34.860 --> 41:36.027
Mm-mm.

41:36.061 --> 41:38.630
You're gonna have to
call me by my real name.

41:38.664 --> 41:40.298
It's a strong name.

41:40.331 --> 41:42.968
You should be proud.

41:43.001 --> 41:44.603
Darryl.

41:44.636 --> 41:47.138
It feels good to
say it out loud.

41:49.240 --> 41:50.709
Darryl.
