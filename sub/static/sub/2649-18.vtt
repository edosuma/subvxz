00:11.261 --> 00:13.514
This week the
world lost a great man,

00:13.597 --> 00:15.975
and I lost a mentor.

00:16.058 --> 00:20.188
For nearly 60 years
Professor Ringmaster Al Uzielli ...

00:20.270 --> 00:23.615
helped young hopefuls like me
find their clown persona.

00:24.650 --> 00:26.368
Professor Ringmaster?

00:26.443 --> 00:28.366
It's a very prestigious title
at clown college.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.994
One step below
Piemaster General.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.915
Where's Lewis?
Who knows?

00:34.993 --> 00:37.872
Okay, guys, it's just us.
Lift on three.

01:09.236 --> 01:17.246
# Hey, hey #

01:17.327 --> 01:18.499
# Hey ##

01:20.247 --> 01:23.797
Hey, how come you guys haven't
accepted my friend requests?

01:23.875 --> 01:25.468
I didn't know
you were on Facebook.

01:25.544 --> 01:27.888
Yeah, you said it was only for teenagers
and people looking to have affairs.

01:27.963 --> 01:29.886
Well, I figured
if you can't fight it-

01:29.965 --> 01:32.764
Not having the affair.
That's still bad. No, not that.

01:32.843 --> 01:36.518
But there's nothing wrong with catching
up with a few old friends, right?

01:36.597 --> 01:39.851
Or doin' a little social
networking with my B.F.F.'s.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.310
Mmm.
Yeah.

01:41.393 --> 01:43.942
Social networking
or social not-working?

01:44.062 --> 01:47.441
Oh, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get
a picture of us all together on a boat.

01:47.524 --> 01:51.950
I think that's a thing now. So what do you say?
Accept my friend thingy.

01:52.029 --> 01:55.078
Sorry, Mom, I- I didn't get
a friend thingy from you.

01:55.157 --> 01:59.253
Yeah, you know, they have a lot of blocks
on there to protect kids from weirdos.

01:59.369 --> 02:02.293
Mmm, okay. Good, good.
I'll send it again. Great.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.874
Please do.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.129
Please don't.

02:05.208 --> 02:07.256
We got her request
the first time, but ignored it.

02:07.336 --> 02:08.883
I can't have her on there
snooping around,

02:08.961 --> 02:10.464
seeing what I'm doing
at parties.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.549
Or posting pictures of us
on family vacations ...

02:12.633 --> 02:14.727
wearing old, dorky clothes.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.054
What?

02:17.137 --> 02:18.684
What's wrong
with this?

02:19.848 --> 02:22.727
Dad, check it out.
I made one giant Oreo.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.067
Luke, what are you doing?

02:26.146 --> 02:28.990
- You gotta eat it like it's an ear of corn.
- Genius.

02:29.107 --> 02:30.654
Oh.
Wow. New suit.

02:30.734 --> 02:31.951
New everything.

02:32.027 --> 02:35.156
Kids, gather round.
it's time for a life lesson.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.286
Aren't we
already gathered?

02:37.366 --> 02:39.289
Let me tell you something.

02:39.368 --> 02:44.090
Hard work, determination
and perseverance always win out.

02:44.164 --> 02:48.294
I am living proof that
nice guys can finish first.

02:48.377 --> 02:49.845
Today I have
a chance to get ...

02:49.920 --> 02:51.422
the biggest listing
of my career.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.849
Oh, I have never seen
this man so focused.

02:53.924 --> 02:56.347
I'm like a boxer
before the big fight.

02:56.426 --> 02:59.350
That's why I didn't have sex with
Claire last night. Sorry, honey.

02:59.429 --> 03:00.931
Mmm. No, it's-
it's okay.

03:01.056 --> 03:04.435
But as soon as I get this listing- ding!
Let's just stop.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.395
Stop.

03:10.482 --> 03:13.201
I see you. What? I'm scratching.

03:13.276 --> 03:17.702
Hey, Mom, is it okay if I have
a friend come over tomorrow?

03:17.781 --> 03:19.033
Who? Reuben?

03:19.116 --> 03:21.414
Or the nervous one
that gets the nosebleed?

03:21.493 --> 03:22.745
It's Griffin Cooper.

03:22.828 --> 03:24.171
Griffin Cooper?

03:24.246 --> 03:25.714
Griffin Cooper is by far ...

03:25.789 --> 03:27.336
the coolest kid in Manny's grade.

03:27.416 --> 03:30.090
He's a terrific athlete.
He's confident.

03:30.168 --> 03:32.921
Manny's a great kid, sure,
but he's not exactly cool.

03:33.004 --> 03:35.723
He can't even
open a door cool.

03:35.799 --> 03:37.051
Salutations, Wyatt.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.762
I'm so glad you're joining me
for an afternoon of mirth.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.473
Good evening,
Reuben-san.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.274
May I ask you
to remove your shoes?

03:44.349 --> 03:46.022
Tonight
we are going Japanese.

03:46.101 --> 03:50.402
Ah!

03:50.480 --> 03:52.448
I invented a new language
this morning.

03:52.524 --> 03:54.197
When did you guys
become buddies?

03:54.276 --> 03:56.779
Was it a football game in the yard?
You made a great catch?

03:56.862 --> 04:01.242
No, that didn't happen. But the librarian
told me one day I'll be a great catch.

04:03.618 --> 04:06.041
Well, I'm really not
getting that relationship.

04:06.121 --> 04:08.670
Why can't you just be happy that
Manny's making new friends?

04:08.749 --> 04:10.296
'Cause
it doesn't add up.

04:10.375 --> 04:13.720
Cool kids like Griffin Cooper, they
don't hang out with kids like Manny.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.217
Manny's very cool.

04:15.297 --> 04:17.971
Maybe those kids
are finally catching up to him.

04:18.048 --> 04:20.598
Wait a minute. I get it.

04:20.677 --> 04:24.602
Couple of days last week, I took
Manny to school on my motorcycle.

04:24.681 --> 04:27.059
Griffin must think
I'm pretty boss.

04:27.142 --> 04:30.146
Yes, Jay.
it's all because of you.

04:30.228 --> 04:32.105
Kids are lookin' for role models.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.317
Why do you think Fonzie
was so popular?

04:34.399 --> 04:38.745
He told people that they were rich, but
really took their money with his scheme?

04:38.820 --> 04:40.367
No, that's a-

04:41.031 --> 04:42.123
Yes.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.668
Those people were victims
of a Fonzie scheme.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.211
Mmm.

04:51.333 --> 04:52.926
Whew.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.469
it's showtime.

04:56.880 --> 05:01.010
Hey, Dunphy. You gettin' ready
for your one-woman show?

05:01.092 --> 05:02.264
Mitzi.

05:02.344 --> 05:03.971
Mitzi Roth.

05:04.054 --> 05:07.729
A notorious poacher in the world of
high-end residential real estate.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.436
We call her
the nightmare on Elm Street ...

05:10.519 --> 05:13.443
because she sold a lot
of houses on Elm Street.

05:13.522 --> 05:16.822
What are you doing here, Mitzi? I have
an appointment. This is my listing.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.403
Oh, I didn't think that was
dotted-line yet, jazz hands.

05:19.486 --> 05:22.330
No worries.
I may have an interested buyer.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.157
I'll bring him to you.
Really?

05:24.282 --> 05:26.910
Okay, but could you come back later? I
really need to have 'em to myself right now.

05:27.035 --> 05:29.834
Oh, yeah, okay. I completely understand.
Okay. Thanks.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.381
You're welcome.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.800
Wait. What?

05:33.917 --> 05:35.339
What are you doing?

05:35.418 --> 05:36.795
Watch this.  Hello?

05:36.920 --> 05:38.763
It's Mitzi Roth.
And Phil Dunphy.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.137
I may have a prospective buyer
for your beautiful house.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.477
I was wondering if maybe I could
come in- Hey, Stan. Hey, Patti.

05:43.552 --> 05:45.179
And just have a look
for a little while.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.021
We got a lot to talk about.
Come on in.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.644
Um-

05:48.723 --> 05:52.773
Hey, guys, yeah, I'm wondering if
maybe we shouldn't be alone for this.

05:53.562 --> 05:54.984
I'm in.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.907
Go back to condos,
Dunphy.

05:57.983 --> 06:01.829
Oh, my God, this place
is absolutely gorgeous.

06:01.945 --> 06:03.367
Stunning. Stunning.

06:03.446 --> 06:06.325
You are in such good
hands with Phil.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.376
Hey.
How are you GUYS?

06:08.451 --> 06:09.953
I mean,
fingers crossed though.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.915
You know, so many new companies
go belly-up. Terrible.

06:12.998 --> 06:14.921
Well, good to-
good to see you, Mitzi.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.885
Guys, how are you? Oh, no, no. it's fine.
it's fine. Come take a look.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.804
Oh, thank you.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.514
Mitzi, please.
Thank you.

06:21.590 --> 06:23.513
Mitzi, please.
Please.

06:23.633 --> 06:26.056
What are you doing? Oh, my God!
He shoved me!

06:26.136 --> 06:27.513
What?
He shoved me!

06:27.637 --> 06:29.685
- For God's sake! Phil!
- Oh, my God!

06:29.764 --> 06:32.233
I thought you had your anger
problem under control.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.357
I don't have an anger-

06:34.436 --> 06:38.031
I don't- Anger problem-
I don't have an anger problem.

06:39.107 --> 06:41.701
Oh, hey. it's over?
What the hell?

06:41.776 --> 06:44.245
- You're an hour late.
- Good to see you too, Chuckleberry.

06:44.321 --> 06:46.824
Look at that. Your oversized
pants are startin' to fit.

06:47.866 --> 06:50.335
Hello, Lewis.

06:50.869 --> 06:52.871
Hello, Fizbo.

06:52.954 --> 06:55.548
For several years,
I was one half of ...

06:55.624 --> 06:57.092
the renowned clown duo
Fizbo and Lewis.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.510
We were huge.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.087
In children's parties.

07:00.170 --> 07:02.969
Anyway, I disbanded the group
shortly after I met Mitchell.

07:03.048 --> 07:06.222
It's hard to have a relationship
and a clown career.

07:06.301 --> 07:08.474
That's the reason there are
so many single clowns.

07:08.553 --> 07:09.975
It's just
one of the reasons.

07:10.055 --> 07:12.228
Anyway, um, Lewis
hasn't spoken to me since.

07:12.307 --> 07:14.605
He's still bitter,
and I don't blame him.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.812
It's kind of like
I broke up the Beatles.

07:16.895 --> 07:19.523
Of children's parties.

07:19.606 --> 07:22.234
What do you say we hit a bar?
Tip a few back to Al, huh?

07:22.359 --> 07:24.032
I heard you were in jail. Yeah?

07:24.110 --> 07:27.159
I heard you're still doin' that lame
giant-scissors bit, you blue-haired hack.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.954
Who's in? I'll go.
Just give me a minute.

07:30.033 --> 07:32.582
I gotta redo my lips.
All right. Cerveza.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.463
What about you,
Fizzy?

07:35.538 --> 07:37.836
You gonna come, or are you gonna
break up this party too'?

07:40.627 --> 07:42.470
Hey, shotgun, bitches!

07:44.297 --> 07:46.720
I should, you know, probably go.
You know, for- for Al.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.804
Oh, yeah. No, of course. But listen,
don't let him get to you, all right?

07:49.886 --> 07:52.435
No, it's fine. it's all
seltzer under the bridge.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.391
Just one drink
and then I'll be home.

07:54.516 --> 07:57.440
Okay. Just drive me home first?
No, you- you take the car.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.442
I, uh-
I'll go with the guys.

07:59.521 --> 08:03.196
In that tiny car? How are
you all possibly gonna-

08:03.274 --> 08:04.992
Forget I asked.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.999
It's 5:00 in the morning.

08:18.123 --> 08:19.750
Daddy's juggling.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.131
Lily, honey, what-
what are you doing up?

08:22.252 --> 08:24.505
Are you just getting home? Yeah,
things got a little out of hand.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.089
Somebody had a ?ower
that squirted tequila.

08:26.172 --> 08:29.051
What do you mean, "somebody"?
I want full credit.

08:29.175 --> 08:31.473
What up, red? Really?

08:31.594 --> 08:33.938
Teach me to juggle! it's very simple.

08:34.014 --> 08:37.860
The key is to be aware of where
everything is at all times.

08:41.438 --> 08:44.487
And don't forget the
importance of balance- Whoa!

08:44.566 --> 08:47.490
- Okay, okay. Come on.
- I think I cracked my eggs.

08:48.987 --> 08:51.115
We're out of eggs?
Are you yolking?

08:51.197 --> 08:54.121
I haven't eaten in five days!

08:56.077 --> 08:58.250
Five days?
Are you cereal?

08:58.329 --> 08:59.956
Whoa!

09:00.040 --> 09:02.543
Lily,
don't ever do that.

09:06.755 --> 09:10.601
Okay. You two are deliberately
not confirming me.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.894
Everybody else has
accepted my friend requests.

09:12.969 --> 09:15.813
Your father.
Uncle Mitchell.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.232
Adele.

09:17.307 --> 09:18.729
That's right.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.981
Adele has agreed to be my friend,
and my own daughters haven't.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.940
Yeah, you may just be
a fan of Adele and not-

09:24.022 --> 09:26.116
What is so private
that I can't possibly see it?

09:26.191 --> 09:27.613
Nothing.

09:27.692 --> 09:30.320
Nothing. So you just ...
don't want to be my friend.

09:30.403 --> 09:33.202
That's great. I can see
my next status update.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.828
"My daughters
are monsters."

09:34.908 --> 09:36.785
You're
not gonna believe this.

09:36.868 --> 09:38.415
Mitzi got the listing.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.543
Oh, no, honey.
That's awful!

09:40.622 --> 09:42.545
She cheated, she lied,
and she won.

09:42.665 --> 09:45.464
Kids, gather round.
Again, we are gathered.

09:45.543 --> 09:48.217
You want to get ahead?
Don't play by the rules.

09:48.296 --> 09:52.472
Turns out nice guys finish last
in this cold, dog-eat-dog world.

09:52.550 --> 09:56.430
It's not fair. Why don't you play dirty too?
You could take her down.

09:56.513 --> 09:59.187
Honey, 'cause your dad
is a better man than that.

09:59.307 --> 10:02.026
He has values and morals and- Shh.
You. Keep talking.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.651
Well, just off
the top of my head,

10:04.729 --> 10:07.778
you could take my spy pen and
record her admitting what she did.

10:07.857 --> 10:11.361
And then you could play it for those people
so they'd realize what a jerk she is.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.037
Your dad is never
gonna do that.

10:13.113 --> 10:16.162
You're a regular chatterbox today.
Get me that pen.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.539
I got it.  Remember,
pal, keep it simple.

10:24.207 --> 10:25.550
Hey, Manny.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.094
Griffin, the legendary
creature of Greek mythology ...

10:28.169 --> 10:30.763
with the head of a lion
and wings of an eagle.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.133
What'd you say, Jay?
Never mind.

10:36.511 --> 10:38.434
Jay Pritchett.
Nice to meet you.

10:38.513 --> 10:40.436
Nice to
meet you too.

10:40.515 --> 10:42.188
You know, I, uh-

10:42.267 --> 10:45.237
I saw a little of that basketball
game of yours last week.

10:45.353 --> 10:47.355
You were lightin' it up. Thanks.

10:47.438 --> 10:49.361
I was lighting it up
too, Jay.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.192
Who's hot? We're hot!

10:51.276 --> 10:53.153
Mustangs are hot!

10:53.236 --> 10:55.739
Brrrr! Whoo!
Brrrr! Hey!

10:55.822 --> 10:58.746
Hola, Griffin.
How are you?

11:00.660 --> 11:02.879
Uh- Oh!
Thirteen.

11:03.538 --> 11:04.790
I'm fine.

11:04.873 --> 11:07.046
So what do you boys
have planned for today?

11:07.125 --> 11:10.846
Well, it's kind of a surprise for Griffin,
but let's just say it involves decoupage.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.593
Oh, geez.
Come on. Let's go.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.263
Good-bye.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.104
Oh, no.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.973
What?
You were right.

11:22.056 --> 11:24.354
This boy is not here
to see Manny.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.562
I told you. You see the
way he looks at me?

11:26.644 --> 11:29.568
No, Fonzie,
the way he looks at me.

11:29.647 --> 11:32.196
He couldn't talk.
He kept staring.

11:32.275 --> 11:34.744
He was just like my teachers
back in school.

11:34.819 --> 11:38.540
Gloria, you're very pretty,
but the kid idolizes me.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.288
Really?

11:41.284 --> 11:42.831
Griffin! Manny!

11:42.911 --> 11:45.334
Do you want to go with Jay
to ride his motorcycle,

11:45.413 --> 11:49.134
or you want to go with me to the
supermarket and buy a couple of onions?

11:49.250 --> 11:52.003
Motorcycle rides!
Onions sound good.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.383
Huh.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.429
Guess he has
a thing for you too.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.182
Hey.
We're back.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.229
Hey, I- I just finished
cleaning the kitchen,

12:02.305 --> 12:05.184
so if anyone has to do a spit
take, please do it over the sink.

12:05.266 --> 12:08.145
We felt really bad about that,
so we got you a present.

12:08.228 --> 12:12.028
Wh-What's the deal with this? I open it
up, and snakes fly out, or a fire, or-

12:12.148 --> 12:14.992
No. We just know that you like to read.
So open it. Yeah.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.787
- Ah! Got him!
- No. No.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.741
That's exactly what I expected.
Remember when I told you?

12:20.823 --> 12:23.702
Okay, look, it's almost go time. So we
should have a shot and go white up.

12:23.785 --> 12:25.708
Excuse me.
White up?

12:25.787 --> 12:27.960
Oh, yeah, Lewis got a call to do
a birthday party this afternoon,

12:28.039 --> 12:29.962
so we're gonna put
the old act back together.

12:30.041 --> 12:33.341
Yeah, Fizbo and Lewis, together again.
And they said it would never happen.

12:33.419 --> 12:36.343
Said. Hoped. Could I talk
to you for a second?

12:36.422 --> 12:38.095
Uh-oh.
Trouble in queeradise.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.893
Okay, look, gonna go out
to the car for smokes.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.230
Please tell me "smokes"
is not another clown.

12:44.347 --> 12:47.271
'Cause I don't think I could handle another
one of him. Lewis is not that bad.

12:47.350 --> 12:49.899
- What do you see in that guy, Cam?
- I don't know.

12:49.978 --> 12:52.982
Maybe the fact that he doesn't roll his eyes
every time I talk about the art of clowning.

12:53.064 --> 12:54.361
Like that.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.989
He may have had his faults,
but we were great together.

12:57.068 --> 13:01.665
We had an unspoken language. We
finished each other's balloon animals.

13:01.739 --> 13:06.415
But you would never know, because you have
never been to one of our performances.

13:06.494 --> 13:07.791
Birthday parties.

13:07.912 --> 13:10.415
You hate my clown side.
No.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.341
No, no.
I don't hate it.

13:12.417 --> 13:15.170
Just admit it.
I basically already know you do.

13:15.253 --> 13:18.348
Okay, okay.
Cards on the table.

13:18.423 --> 13:20.596
- It's not my favorite thing that you-
- Oh, how dare you!

13:20.675 --> 13:22.973
I am a clown.
it's who I am.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.929
If you squeeze me,
do I not honk?

13:25.054 --> 13:28.729
Eye roll. Oh, like
I had a choice.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.647
Knock-knock.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.198
What are you
doing here?

13:35.273 --> 13:37.401
Hey, um, I-
I brought you some soup.

13:37.483 --> 13:40.487
You know, I thought about it,
and maybe I did push you.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.823
So, how's the ankle?

13:42.905 --> 13:45.829
Oh, come on, Dunphy.
You know I flopped.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.831
Haven't you ever seen
an NBA game?

13:47.910 --> 13:51.380
Oh, I'm sorry.
In your case, WNBA.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.504
So that was all a ruse?

13:53.583 --> 13:56.587
The oldest trick in the book. You
need to step up your game, son.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.593
You know what?
I almost feel sorry for you.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.300
Come here.
Give me a big hug.

14:02.383 --> 14:04.636
Oh, yeah, yeah.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.638
No hard feelings, huh?
None at all.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.733
Good. Because I just recorded
your entire confession.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.309
Right here on my-

14:11.392 --> 14:13.611
Spy Den?

14:13.686 --> 14:15.688
Second-oldest trick
in the book.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.360
Um-  Oh, God.

14:17.440 --> 14:20.239
A real man would have
just poisoned the soup.

14:21.235 --> 14:23.112
Are we done here?

14:29.285 --> 14:30.958
Ah, thank you.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.710
Hey, Mom!
Guess what!

14:32.789 --> 14:36.293
Griffin invited us all over to his house
for a pool party and barbecue tonight.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.095
- Pool party, huh?
- Yeah, and he said bring your swimsuits.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.717
He was pretty adamant
about it.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.219
It's 50 degrees outside.

14:42.340 --> 14:44.468
Sounds fun. Great.
I'll call him.

14:46.260 --> 14:49.514
You know, you're basically agreeing
to a date with a 13-year-old boy.

14:49.597 --> 14:52.066
Jay, we use this to get us
tables at restaurants.

14:52.141 --> 14:54.269
Why can't we use this
to get Manny a friend?

14:54.394 --> 14:56.613
Because he's not really
getting a friend. Oh.

14:56.687 --> 14:59.531
But when you thought that he was trying
to ride your motorcycle, it was okay.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.780
Maybe now I don't like
what he's trying to ride.

15:01.859 --> 15:03.452
Manny likes Griffin.

15:03.528 --> 15:06.828
Maybe someday, if they spend enough
time together, Griffin will like Manny.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.954
What?
Griffin doesn't like me?

15:10.159 --> 15:12.287
No, no, no, papi,
he loves you.

15:12.370 --> 15:16.125
But you just said someday Griffin will like me.
That means he doesn't like me now.

15:16.207 --> 15:18.005
You know what, kid?

15:18.084 --> 15:20.587
We think that Griffin ...

15:20.670 --> 15:22.593
might be
hanging out with you ...

15:22.672 --> 15:25.425
because he's got a little
crush on your mother and me.

15:25.550 --> 15:28.053
On you? Wow. I can't believe it.

15:28.177 --> 15:30.555
Listen, it's fine. You're gonna be fine.
I'm sorry.

15:30.680 --> 15:34.025
Are you kidding? it's fantastic!
How is it fantastic?

15:34.100 --> 15:37.149
I'm only hanging out with him because
I have the hots for his sister Chloe.

15:37.228 --> 15:39.151
You've met Griffin.
The kid's a doorknob.

15:39.230 --> 15:41.949
So you're
just using him?

15:42.024 --> 15:44.868
Yeah, and I felt
really guilty about it until now.

15:44.986 --> 15:47.034
Now it's a win-win.
Not for me.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.535
Just suck it up, Mom.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.367
I've done a lot for you over the years.
Jay, you too.

15:51.451 --> 15:54.796
This girl could be the one. Then
I'm out of your hair forever.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.873
Pool party, Mom.
Dress accordingly.

16:02.211 --> 16:05.385
Can you help me reach that
box of cereal?

16:05.465 --> 16:06.717
Hey.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.222
You're Mitzi Roth. I
recognized you from your ads.

16:09.343 --> 16:12.017
Smokin', right?
I'm Luke Dunphy.

16:12.138 --> 16:15.062
My dad's Phil Dunphy.
I'm sorry.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.643
Why do you hate him
so much?

16:16.726 --> 16:19.320
It's just business, kid.
It's not personal.

16:19.395 --> 16:22.148
Well, it's personal to us.

16:22.231 --> 16:25.280
I've never seen my dad
so worried before.

16:25.359 --> 16:28.613
I have this spy pen, and I
heard him talking to my mom,

16:28.696 --> 16:32.326
and he's scared about paying for
my sister's college next year.

16:32.408 --> 16:35.287
And I guess he's nervous
about some kind of party,

16:35.369 --> 16:38.339
because he said there's
a big balloon payment.

16:38.414 --> 16:41.839
Anyways, he's, like,
the best dad ever,

16:41.918 --> 16:45.092
so maybe you could be
a little nicer to him.

16:45.171 --> 16:46.673
There you are,
buddy.

16:46.756 --> 16:49.384
Check it out. They're giving
away free jelly beans.

16:49.509 --> 16:52.262
Hi, Mitzi.
Dunphy.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.689
You have
a very nice kid there.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.311
He's mine.

17:00.937 --> 17:02.359
Hey. So I was thinking-

17:02.438 --> 17:04.486
After Little Fizbo,
we could do the ladder bit.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.488
Ah, crap,
I forgot the ladder.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.490
You know what? I'll
remember it next weekend.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.617
What's next weekend?

17:10.695 --> 17:12.698
We got a town fair
in Thousand Oaks ...

17:12.781 --> 17:14.704
and a birthday party
in Pasadena.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.912
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I- I can't do that.

17:16.993 --> 17:19.247
What do you mean? I'm the one with
outstanding warrants in Pasadena.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.878
No, we're taking Lily to
the aquarium next weekend.

17:21.958 --> 17:25.132
You know, Lewis, this was
just a one-time thing, right?

17:25.211 --> 17:27.760
Well, what happened to we're
puttin' the act back together?

17:27.838 --> 17:30.091
Well, that was
just for today.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.847
Oh.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.515
Oh, sure.

17:33.636 --> 17:36.014
I'm sorry if you thought- No, no, no.
I get it.

17:36.097 --> 17:38.099
You're a family man now.

17:39.517 --> 17:40.689
Hey.

17:42.645 --> 17:46.149
Let's go out there and make this the best
show Fizbo and Lewis have ever done.

17:48.192 --> 17:49.990
You got it, partner.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.368
Ladies and germs,
boys and girls,

17:53.447 --> 17:58.954
say hello to my good friend,
Little Fizbo!

18:02.498 --> 18:05.217
Hello, big people.

18:05.293 --> 18:07.295
Hi!

18:07.378 --> 18:10.678
Let's get this party started!

18:15.261 --> 18:19.061
Wow, all this dancing
sure has made me hungry.

18:19.140 --> 18:20.983
Wish I had something to eat.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.943
Oh, forgot I had
that fish over there.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.992
Don't know why he's so mad at me.
He was fine just a minute ago.

18:29.066 --> 18:32.570
Oh! Okay. Somebody's
a little punchy today.

18:32.653 --> 18:34.951
Hey, what's the frying pan
doing here?

18:35.031 --> 18:38.376
When did we add a frying pan to the act?
Nope, don't need the frying pan.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.421
Why are you doing that?
Stop doing that.

18:41.495 --> 18:44.294
- Screw you, you traitor.
- Ow! That hurts! Seriously. Stop it.

18:44.373 --> 18:46.671
You know what hurts?
Abandonment.

18:51.339 --> 18:53.967
Listen to 'em laughing.
We could've been something.

18:54.050 --> 18:56.803
We could've been-
I can't do this bit by myself!

19:00.765 --> 19:03.063
Somebody- Somebody-

19:03.142 --> 19:05.816
This isn't pretend!
Someone grab an adult, please!

19:10.816 --> 19:13.365
Mitzi. Your kid
forgot his cereal.

19:13.444 --> 19:15.788
There's a surprise
in every box.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.082
it's diabetes.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.660
You drove all the way
over here for this?

19:20.743 --> 19:23.838
Okay, look, here's the deal. You can
have that listing if you want it.

19:23.954 --> 19:26.252
What? Yeah. The couple
are a real pain.

19:26.332 --> 19:27.959
I'm too old for
that kind of headache.

19:28.084 --> 19:30.587
Just keep your mouth shut about it.
Thank you so much.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.172
I just said zip it!

19:32.296 --> 19:33.593
Oh. You did-
Unbelievable.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.637
I'm so sorry. But thank you.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.184
Bye.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.804
Kids, gather round!

19:39.929 --> 19:41.897
We are right here!
Oh.

19:41.972 --> 19:44.020
Let me tell you
something.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.353
People are
fundamentally good.

19:46.435 --> 19:49.154
The key is, you find that
goodness deep within them,

19:49.230 --> 19:52.860
twist it and turn it
to your advantage.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.194
Hello.
Pshh!

19:54.276 --> 19:57.246
And there she is.

19:57.321 --> 19:58.789
What are you
gonna hit?

19:58.864 --> 20:00.741
College, balloon payment,
greatest dad ever.

20:00.866 --> 20:04.120
- Nice. You want me to squirt some tears in your eyes?
- Dad, please.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.547
I was fake crying
before I could walk.

20:06.622 --> 20:09.626
How do you think I got out
of eating all those salads?

20:15.089 --> 20:18.639
Can you help me reach that
box of cereal?

20:18.718 --> 20:20.641
Oh, hey, you're
Mitzi Roth, right?

20:20.720 --> 20:22.188
I recognized you
from your ads.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.181
Smokin', huh?

20:24.306 --> 20:28.186
I can't believe you got that
listing back, honey! Sweetheart!

20:28.310 --> 20:29.527
Ohh.
Honey.

20:29.645 --> 20:31.647
Mm-hmm?
Ding.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.905
Are you sure you want
to ding a chatterbox?

20:34.984 --> 20:37.203
Hmm.
Wh- Uh-

20:37.278 --> 20:38.655
Honey.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.866
Quick. What's the trick
to those fake tears?

20:40.948 --> 20:42.791
The Three Stooges
are all dead.

20:43.826 --> 20:45.453
Yeah, that's good.

20:49.832 --> 20:53.211
Well, it looks like
somebody likes Coldplay.

20:53.294 --> 20:54.762
Hmm. Right. You saw.

20:54.837 --> 20:56.009
Uh-huh.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.716
Did you see the pictures
I posted from Thanksgiving?

20:58.841 --> 21:01.845
Totes adorbs. I'm
going to kill myself.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.771
You gotta check out my wall.
Right there.

21:04.847 --> 21:07.771
"Spring Break, 1990,
New Orleans."

21:07.850 --> 21:10.069
Is that you?
What?

21:10.144 --> 21:12.442
Some guy from your college
tagged you in a picture.

21:19.987 --> 21:22.456
