02:53.287 --> 02:55.123
It's
also extremely grim out there

02:55.125 --> 02:58.396
so please do take care on
the roads this evening.

02:58.398 --> 02:59.898
Gale force winds are forecast

02:59.900 --> 03:01.067
throughout the rest of the night

03:01.069 --> 03:03.340
and severe weather
warnings remain in place

03:03.342 --> 03:06.279
across The Southwest
and surrounding areas.

03:06.281 --> 03:09.284
It's really not very
pleasant at all.

03:09.286 --> 03:11.488
Stay with us for updates
on the weather situation

03:11.490 --> 03:13.626
every 15 minutes.

03:13.628 --> 03:15.864
And the headlines once
again for The Southwest.

03:15.866 --> 03:17.968
The search continues
for a missing patient

03:17.970 --> 03:21.709
who escaped from the Seaview
secure unit earlier today.

03:21.711 --> 03:23.546
The resident, who
should not be approached

03:23.548 --> 03:24.881
is described as being -

05:44.296 --> 05:46.599
Hello,
can you let me in?

05:46.601 --> 05:47.770
No, go away!

05:49.306 --> 05:52.075
Please, I need help!

05:52.077 --> 05:54.181
Well, who are you?

05:54.183 --> 05:56.719
I'm hurt, please!

05:56.721 --> 05:59.525
Can I just use your phone or
anything, just for a minute.

05:59.527 --> 06:00.329
Please!

06:09.111 --> 06:10.880
What do you want?

06:10.882 --> 06:12.183
Do you know what time
it is, for God sake,

06:12.185 --> 06:13.585
what are you doing here?

06:13.587 --> 06:15.323
Please, let me in.

06:15.325 --> 06:18.328
I fell, I think
I've busted my arm.

06:18.330 --> 06:19.165
Please.

06:24.310 --> 06:28.484
Okay, well hurry before
we both freeze to death.

06:51.264 --> 06:52.933
Here, put that down.

06:57.876 --> 06:59.578
Sit down there.

06:59.580 --> 07:02.186
You're freezing, you poor thing.

07:11.770 --> 07:13.405
I'm sorry there's no electric.

07:13.407 --> 07:16.044
The lights went out
with the storm earlier.

07:16.046 --> 07:17.680
And they've been flickering
on and off for ages

07:17.682 --> 07:19.617
but I think they finally
given up the ghost.

07:19.619 --> 07:21.389
Oh, I don't mind.

07:21.391 --> 07:24.128
It's better than
being out there.

07:29.172 --> 07:31.742
What the devil are you doing
out in a night like this?

07:31.744 --> 07:34.079
You're lucky you didn't
catch your death.

07:34.081 --> 07:35.951
Thanks for opening the door.

07:35.953 --> 07:37.753
It's fucking freezing out there.

07:37.755 --> 07:39.260
Yeah, precisely.

07:42.064 --> 07:44.570
I'll find you another blanket.

08:35.205 --> 08:39.345
It's fine, it's
all fine, I'm fine.

08:47.762 --> 08:50.632
Found a towel, this
will do won't it?

09:08.035 --> 09:09.205
Do I know you?

09:16.019 --> 09:17.386
What have you done to yourself?

09:17.388 --> 09:18.290
Let me see.

09:21.029 --> 09:23.097
Don't be a baby, I
used to be a nurse.

09:23.099 --> 09:24.836
Well, I wanted to be.

09:25.806 --> 09:27.476
I helped the nurses.

09:30.245 --> 09:30.815
Anyway, let me see.

09:34.190 --> 09:36.761
Well, do you think it's broken?

09:38.297 --> 09:42.337
When you fell did you feel
it break or hear it snap?

09:42.339 --> 09:43.441
Fuck knows.

09:44.577 --> 09:46.245
I heard something but
it could have been

09:46.247 --> 09:49.253
the bits of wood
or twigs I fell on.

09:50.722 --> 09:52.292
I really need to.

09:56.901 --> 09:57.735
Ow!

10:01.444 --> 10:02.743
Yeah.

10:02.745 --> 10:03.380
There.

10:03.847 --> 10:05.150
Fuck.

10:06.354 --> 10:07.989
Hmm, can you move it
at all, your fingers?

10:12.832 --> 10:15.034
I don't think you'd be
able to move your fingers

10:15.036 --> 10:16.472
if it was broken.

10:16.474 --> 10:19.042
I remember when my
little boy broke his arm.

10:19.044 --> 10:20.380
And I think you'd be
in a lot more pain.

10:20.382 --> 10:22.049
More pain?

10:22.051 --> 10:25.523
It hurts like a bastard already.

10:25.525 --> 10:27.829
How did you fall?

10:28.997 --> 10:31.168
I was running
and, I don't know,

10:32.639 --> 10:34.674
I tripped over a
fucking tree stump

10:34.676 --> 10:37.814
and bam down I fucking went.

10:37.816 --> 10:39.952
Look, I know you're in pain

10:39.954 --> 10:41.555
but I really would appreciate it

10:41.557 --> 10:43.725
if you wouldn't
swear quite so much.

10:43.727 --> 10:45.630
My husband always
swore and I hated it.

10:45.632 --> 10:47.065
I'm sure it's not
that necessary.

10:47.067 --> 10:48.167
But it hurts like...

10:48.169 --> 10:49.004
Like?

10:50.407 --> 10:51.242
Like...

10:52.846 --> 10:54.313
A lot.

10:54.315 --> 10:56.252
There, that's better.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.325
Let's start again.

11:02.899 --> 11:05.571
So we're looking at
just about the elbow.

11:07.008 --> 11:09.546
I think you need to take the
weight off it for a start.

11:12.083 --> 11:16.260
There's a scarf I saw somewhere,
can use it as a sling.

11:19.332 --> 11:20.166
Uh.

11:23.608 --> 11:26.347
Sorry, can't see
a flaming thing.

13:08.316 --> 13:09.485
Hello?

13:10.355 --> 13:11.189
Hello!

13:13.794 --> 13:15.528
Why are you shouting?

13:15.530 --> 13:16.699
I'm just here.

13:17.901 --> 13:19.070
Found a scarf.

13:28.791 --> 13:30.794
Now, let's pop this off.

13:32.965 --> 13:36.472
Right, just lift your
arm up a little bit.

13:37.541 --> 13:39.643
Pop this through there.

13:39.645 --> 13:40.480
That's it.

13:42.852 --> 13:43.886
♪ Put on our clothes

13:43.888 --> 13:45.422
♪ Put on our clothes

13:49.399 --> 13:53.574
♪ So early in the morning ♪

13:59.586 --> 14:01.690
There, how's that, better?

14:04.028 --> 14:06.367
Yeah, much better, thanks.

14:08.036 --> 14:08.870
See?

14:10.775 --> 14:13.177
Told you I used to be a nurse.

14:17.321 --> 14:21.497
I would phone for a doctor but
I'm afraid the phone is dead.

14:24.836 --> 14:27.973
What's silver and doesn't work?

14:27.975 --> 14:29.177
This telephone.

14:31.849 --> 14:33.886
Not that it would
make much difference.

14:33.888 --> 14:35.956
The lane is bad
enough in the daytime.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.197
Far too dangerous at night.

14:42.004 --> 14:44.138
I doubt you'd be able to
get a signal either my love,

14:44.140 --> 14:46.678
middle of nowhere,
hadn't you noticed?

14:46.680 --> 14:49.519
I've got no
battery left anyway.

14:53.593 --> 14:56.600
It's okay, just let
me warm up a bit

14:57.901 --> 15:01.041
and rest and I'll
get out of your way.

15:02.745 --> 15:04.680
You wanna go back
out there again?

15:04.682 --> 15:05.915
In this?

15:05.917 --> 15:07.586
You wanna break
your neck as well?

15:11.162 --> 15:13.832
And then there was light.

15:13.834 --> 15:15.335
Yay!

15:17.942 --> 15:19.544
Oh thank goodness.

15:27.428 --> 15:30.498
You okay?

15:30.500 --> 15:31.335
Oh!

15:32.472 --> 15:33.974
Oh, what a bugger.

15:36.144 --> 15:39.116
Or as you might want to
say, what a fucking bugger.

15:41.790 --> 15:45.965
Oh well, looks like you're
stuck here for the night.

15:46.833 --> 15:48.200
And if that's the case I for one

15:48.202 --> 15:50.672
would like to know your name.

15:50.674 --> 15:52.208
I'm Joyce.

15:52.210 --> 15:53.046
Oh.

15:55.015 --> 15:56.484
I'm John.

15:56.486 --> 15:57.322
John?

15:58.257 --> 15:59.993
That's a lovely name.

16:01.597 --> 16:02.931
Always liked it.

16:08.977 --> 16:11.215
It's nice to meet you John.

16:20.834 --> 16:24.675
I'd also prefer more
candles if I can find any.

17:11.068 --> 17:14.174
So how far
from town are we?

17:25.564 --> 17:29.037
Ooh, many many miles, John.

17:30.005 --> 17:31.342
Many many miles.

17:32.478 --> 17:35.315
'Tis a very lonely
house you found here.

17:35.317 --> 17:39.458
Very lonely and very dark.

17:53.586 --> 17:55.956
I'd
say it was about 10, 11

17:55.958 --> 17:58.062
miles to the village.

17:59.698 --> 18:03.205
Although, it's easy to go
round and round in circles

18:03.207 --> 18:07.381
at night in the dark so you
could end up walking 20.

18:09.785 --> 18:11.254
I've been lost loads of times

18:11.256 --> 18:14.996
walking out there in
the middle of the night.

18:16.832 --> 18:17.634
What?

18:19.071 --> 18:22.545
Why were you out walking
in the middle of the night?

18:23.313 --> 18:25.517
Well, you know.

18:29.993 --> 18:32.832
Well it's nice to
go walking at night.

18:33.433 --> 18:34.469
It's peaceful.

18:37.173 --> 18:41.081
There's lots of reasons
to go walking at night.

18:44.688 --> 18:46.191
Walking the dog?

18:47.060 --> 18:48.594
They always need walking.

18:48.596 --> 18:51.301
That's enough reasons to go
walking at night, isn't it?

18:51.303 --> 18:52.736
Have you got a dog?

18:52.738 --> 18:54.139
No, of course I
haven't got a dog.

18:54.141 --> 18:55.544
Do you see a dog?

18:56.679 --> 18:58.447
I'm just saying that
if you had a dog

18:58.449 --> 19:01.020
it would need walking at night.

19:02.290 --> 19:04.760
Besides I can walk
anywhere anytime.

19:04.762 --> 19:07.499
I don't need permission,
I am allowed.

19:07.501 --> 19:09.469
Young John with
the 20 questions.

19:09.471 --> 19:11.641
Huh, who's in charge here?

19:11.643 --> 19:15.514
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to upset you.

19:15.516 --> 19:18.620
I just think I may need a
doctor for my arm, that's all.

19:18.622 --> 19:21.494
Yes I know, your
arm, your arm.

19:21.496 --> 19:22.732
You poor thing.

19:32.083 --> 19:32.918
I'm sorry.

19:35.690 --> 19:37.026
It's so late and

19:38.563 --> 19:41.601
I've hardly slept with
this blooming weather and

19:41.603 --> 19:45.474
what with the lights
flickering on and off it's,

19:45.476 --> 19:48.715
it's enough to drive anyone
up, up the wall, isn't it?

19:48.717 --> 19:50.386
You must be tired.

19:51.255 --> 19:54.026
Yes, I am very.

19:59.439 --> 20:01.574
Just have to make
the best of it.

20:01.576 --> 20:03.312
Sit it out 'til morning.

20:32.871 --> 20:35.209
It looks freezing out there.

20:36.312 --> 20:38.114
Not much better in here.

20:41.889 --> 20:46.064
Used to love watching storms,
as a child, from the window.

20:47.734 --> 20:49.069
How old are you?

20:52.244 --> 20:56.385
When I was 11 there
was a storm, huge.

20:57.453 --> 20:58.289
Hellish.

20:59.658 --> 21:01.226
I'm 19.

21:01.228 --> 21:05.201
No one would let me watch
it though, I was too little.

21:05.203 --> 21:08.674
Stay away from the window
girl, it's dangerous.

21:08.676 --> 21:10.244
They were all at the
bloody window though,

21:10.246 --> 21:13.251
both my parents and
my older brother.

21:22.537 --> 21:24.104
There was a massive
bolt of lightning

21:24.106 --> 21:26.279
and the window was struck.

21:27.880 --> 21:30.386
My father was killed instantly

21:31.522 --> 21:33.693
and my mother lost an eye.

21:35.931 --> 21:39.437
My brother was cut
badly but nothing more.

21:43.546 --> 21:44.781
Hey, it's fine.

21:46.184 --> 21:49.490
My mother, she wears a pretty
diamante eye patch now.

21:49.492 --> 21:53.667
And my brother, well, he recovered
with only a few scars so.

21:56.239 --> 21:58.943
Oh, my father,

22:00.714 --> 22:02.215
didn't like him much anyway.

22:02.217 --> 22:03.620
So it's all good.

22:07.025 --> 22:09.396
Now I can do what I like.

22:09.398 --> 22:12.968
I can watch any storm
I want from the window.

22:12.970 --> 22:15.607
Though frankly there's
not much to see, is there?

22:15.609 --> 22:18.880
Just a lot of leaves
blowing about.

22:18.882 --> 22:22.288
Don't know what
all the fuzz was.

22:22.290 --> 22:25.530
Certainly not worth
losing an eye over.

22:27.234 --> 22:28.068
Still.

23:16.164 --> 23:20.139
So, what am I gonna do with you?

23:22.243 --> 23:23.078
John.

23:26.284 --> 23:30.460
I mean, what can we do
to while away the hours

23:31.194 --> 23:32.731
on this long dark night?

23:35.469 --> 23:36.304
Any ideas?

23:39.310 --> 23:40.144
John?

23:41.249 --> 23:42.917
What do you mean?

23:45.290 --> 23:46.792
Look, I'm only 19.

23:49.498 --> 23:53.203
You're okay looking, you're
really pretty for your age

23:53.205 --> 23:55.340
but you're just so
much older than me.

23:55.342 --> 23:56.843
What are you
blithering on about?

23:56.845 --> 23:58.346
I just think you're
a bit too old for me.

23:58.348 --> 23:59.416
And my arm really hurts.

23:59.418 --> 24:00.253
What?

24:02.657 --> 24:04.827
I'm not interested in you!

24:06.998 --> 24:08.936
Goodness, that's hilarious!

24:09.672 --> 24:11.106
I'm not Mrs. Robinson.

24:13.713 --> 24:17.888
Oh, you've not idea who
I'm talking about, do you?

24:19.258 --> 24:21.426
She's what you might
call the ultimate cougar.

24:21.428 --> 24:22.663
Which I am not.

24:23.666 --> 24:25.635
The very idea.

24:27.139 --> 24:28.908
Besides, you need to have
two fully workable arms

24:28.910 --> 24:31.547
to have any chance with me.

24:31.549 --> 24:32.384
Oh gosh.

24:34.287 --> 24:36.524
You've made me all coy now.

24:37.426 --> 24:39.762
You're so naughty.

24:59.605 --> 25:01.575
He's young enough to be...

26:39.169 --> 26:41.208
Oh, look what I found.

26:42.643 --> 26:45.381
Monopoly, Scrabble,
even a jigsaw.

26:45.383 --> 26:48.587
Although, I hate jigsaws, don't
know why I brought that out.

26:48.589 --> 26:50.760
Keep us occupied for days.

27:11.066 --> 27:13.137
I'm pretty thawed out.

27:14.608 --> 27:17.880
Bit warmer at least, might
be able to get going soon.

27:18.615 --> 27:19.750
What do you think?

27:20.920 --> 27:22.723
Perhaps you could
give me directions.

27:23.459 --> 27:25.263
For goodness sake.

27:25.996 --> 27:26.996
What's the rush John?

27:26.998 --> 27:28.199
I'm not going to jump on you.

27:28.201 --> 27:30.873
I thought we'd established that.

27:36.050 --> 27:38.389
Ugh, there's no dog.

27:39.725 --> 27:41.295
I'm always the dog.

28:04.573 --> 28:06.911
Okay okay, your arm, I know.

28:09.617 --> 28:12.789
I'll drive you to the
village once it gets light.

28:12.791 --> 28:15.660
As soon as my husband
gets back in the...

28:15.662 --> 28:16.898
in the...

28:24.481 --> 28:25.583
How you feeling?

28:26.785 --> 28:29.123
Good, I'm
feeling really good.

28:30.058 --> 28:31.559
When is he back?

28:31.561 --> 28:32.729
Morning is it?

28:35.769 --> 28:39.109
Yes the morning, of
course, silly woman.

28:40.480 --> 28:43.385
Maybe it's the
afternoon he's back?

28:47.893 --> 28:51.234
I'm sure he wasn't
going to go for long.

28:52.971 --> 28:57.146
I mean, he didn't pack very
much, hardly anything at all.

29:02.857 --> 29:05.660
He should have told me though.

29:05.662 --> 29:07.499
Let me know, you know.

29:12.976 --> 29:15.549
He'll be back, don't you worry.

29:16.751 --> 29:18.687
Anyway, whenever he's
back I'll take the car

29:18.689 --> 29:22.864
and you'll be returned to
civilization, how's that?

29:24.567 --> 29:25.402
Great.

29:41.435 --> 29:43.839
Nice that you have a husband.

29:47.247 --> 29:49.351
The man in the photo.

29:53.525 --> 29:55.260
Yes he's my husband,
we're married,

29:55.262 --> 29:57.532
we're very happily married.

29:58.134 --> 29:59.069
I'm sure.

30:00.805 --> 30:02.977
Oh you're sure, are you?

30:04.314 --> 30:06.783
Nice that
you have a husband.

30:06.785 --> 30:08.520
Just glad you're
not out here alone.

30:08.522 --> 30:10.024
Alone, out here?

30:12.729 --> 30:14.298
How silly.

30:14.300 --> 30:15.134
Alone?

30:16.838 --> 30:18.540
And besides I'm not
the one running around

30:18.542 --> 30:20.646
in the middle of a forest
with a bloody broken arm.

30:21.247 --> 30:22.447
Am I John?

30:22.449 --> 30:24.320
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to upset you.

30:32.569 --> 30:35.074
Have you got any pain killers?

30:40.285 --> 30:42.554
Well, as you're in such pain,

30:42.556 --> 30:46.732
I'll see if I can find anything
in my cupboards for it.

30:53.878 --> 30:55.715
I don't want to.

30:57.786 --> 30:59.790
I'll just look in there.

31:00.759 --> 31:02.296
I'm not going to talk about it.

31:15.021 --> 31:16.792
Yes I know, I know, I do.

31:17.959 --> 31:20.799
That's right, I
do have a husband.

31:24.607 --> 31:26.542
He's just trying to
make me feel stupid

31:26.544 --> 31:28.981
I wouldn't be out here alone.

31:54.868 --> 31:56.503
Here's your pain killers.

31:56.505 --> 31:57.573
Oh, thanks.

32:18.548 --> 32:21.017
Uh, can we light the fire?

32:21.019 --> 32:23.623
Uh, stupid, there's no power.

32:23.625 --> 32:25.563
But it's a real fire.

32:48.407 --> 32:49.476
Need a light?

32:50.479 --> 32:52.147
Thank you.

33:09.081 --> 33:10.952
You okay?

33:11.687 --> 33:13.457
Yeah I'm fine, thanks.

33:28.119 --> 33:28.954
Here.

33:32.796 --> 33:35.635
Oh, the flame's
getting quite big.

33:41.414 --> 33:42.747
Think that looks all right?

33:42.749 --> 33:45.821
Not gonna set the house on fire?

33:45.823 --> 33:48.960
I don't think, don't
think poking is gonna...

33:48.962 --> 33:50.631
I'm not poking it!

33:54.507 --> 33:55.439
Don't poke it!

33:55.441 --> 33:57.645
I'm not going to poke it!

34:02.523 --> 34:05.195
See, told you I'm not poking it.

34:10.773 --> 34:12.507
There, what do you think?

34:12.510 --> 34:14.612
That looks all
right, doesn't it?

34:14.614 --> 34:16.884
Yeah yeah, it looks fine.

34:33.984 --> 34:37.757
That's gonna take
a while, isn't it?

34:37.760 --> 34:39.161
Oh, I am sorry.

34:41.199 --> 34:44.605
I'll see if I can't find you
a hot water bottle, shall I?

34:44.607 --> 34:47.042
Or an electric blanket perhaps?

34:47.043 --> 34:50.783
But then there's no power
so that won't work, will it?

34:50.784 --> 34:52.521
Obviously missed the telegram.

34:52.523 --> 34:53.723
Sorry.

34:53.725 --> 34:54.657
I mean, if I'd
know you were coming

34:54.659 --> 34:56.228
I'd have had the west wing aired

34:56.230 --> 34:58.766
and I wouldn't have given
the staff the night off!

35:05.882 --> 35:07.384
Miserable little fucker!

35:07.386 --> 35:09.019
Fucking warn him!

35:11.393 --> 35:13.731
One, two, three, four, five.

35:14.766 --> 35:16.436
Be nice, I've got to be nice.

35:17.170 --> 35:18.173
I'm sick of being nice!

35:18.908 --> 35:21.547
Six, seven, eight, nine.

35:28.394 --> 35:29.229
Ah.

35:38.748 --> 35:41.552
I'm really sorry for
being a misery guts.

35:41.554 --> 35:45.460
It's just the electric being
out is really getting to me.

35:45.462 --> 35:48.200
Anyway, let me
make it up to you.

35:57.085 --> 35:58.353
Look what I've got.

36:05.835 --> 36:07.068
Ah!

36:07.070 --> 36:08.507
Oops, my fault.

36:09.977 --> 36:12.483
I hate board games, don't you?

36:15.521 --> 36:19.028
I couldn't find any
glasses so mugs it is.

36:21.133 --> 36:23.971
But it all goes
down the same way.

36:31.453 --> 36:32.755
Just the ticket.

36:35.060 --> 36:36.797
This will warm us up.

36:38.234 --> 36:40.238
Who needs a bloody fire?

36:53.130 --> 36:54.533
How cosy is this?

37:07.926 --> 37:10.329
Where are you from John?

37:10.331 --> 37:12.835
Do you live with your parents?

37:14.205 --> 37:17.980
Don't you think they'll
be worried about you?

37:23.491 --> 37:24.994
A long way away.

37:30.538 --> 37:33.142
What's your mother like John?

37:35.447 --> 37:38.720
Actually she's,
she's a lot like you.

37:41.560 --> 37:44.331
I've not seen her
in a very long time.

37:44.333 --> 37:48.340
Must be seven or nearly
eight, eight years now.

37:50.679 --> 37:52.614
She sent me away.

37:52.616 --> 37:53.450
Why?

37:57.893 --> 37:59.330
Had you been bad?

38:01.701 --> 38:04.740
You can tell me, I
can keep a secret.

38:06.943 --> 38:10.551
Here, maybe this will
help you to remember.

38:20.771 --> 38:24.011
What could have made
her send you away?

38:25.214 --> 38:28.052
What did you do to
make her do that?

38:43.183 --> 38:44.084
Look at us.

38:46.857 --> 38:51.031
Open fire, brandy, blankets,
cabin in the woods.

38:55.407 --> 38:57.010
Miles from nowhere.

39:01.086 --> 39:02.622
Almost like family.

39:06.996 --> 39:09.436
All right, like friends then.

39:11.340 --> 39:13.140
It's a bit like that film.

39:13.142 --> 39:14.643
What's it called?

39:14.645 --> 39:16.148
Uh, flippin' heck.

39:17.618 --> 39:21.726
You know it, you do, that
classic film, the horror.

39:23.063 --> 39:25.700
All those kids getting
murdered one after the other.

39:25.702 --> 39:26.668
Cabin in the Woods.

39:26.670 --> 39:28.171
Cabin in the Woods?

39:28.173 --> 39:29.407
That's not even a film.

39:29.409 --> 39:30.676
Yes it is.

39:30.678 --> 39:32.913
Well I've never heard of it.

39:32.915 --> 39:34.919
No, there was a black lake.

39:36.724 --> 39:39.694
Michael, Michael Myers was it?

39:39.696 --> 39:41.866
Justin, Jas...?

39:42.469 --> 39:43.703
Friday the 13th!

39:44.840 --> 39:46.710
Told you I knew it!

39:47.579 --> 39:49.450
Blooming Cottage in the Woods.

39:51.084 --> 39:52.421
Friday the 13th.

39:54.025 --> 39:56.029
That was about a mother.

40:01.139 --> 40:02.909
Drink up mystery man.

40:04.612 --> 40:06.183
What do you mean?

40:08.587 --> 40:10.556
Well, you've come
here out of nowhere

40:10.558 --> 40:13.464
and I don't even
know your surname.

40:17.171 --> 40:19.843
Um, I assume you have a surname.

40:25.787 --> 40:27.056
Are you hungry?

40:30.063 --> 40:33.002
I'm gonna see what's
in the fridge.

40:39.014 --> 40:41.018
Calm down, it's not him.

40:44.024 --> 40:46.028
Six, seven, eight, nine.

40:49.469 --> 40:51.473
Everything will be fine.

41:57.036 --> 42:00.042
I know. I'm in control.

42:09.730 --> 42:12.836
I'm in control.

44:04.526 --> 44:08.063
Found a block of cheese
and some mayo in the fridge.

44:08.065 --> 44:11.671
Think it's brown bread but it's
hard to tell in this light.

44:11.673 --> 44:13.274
All fresh though and chilled.

44:13.276 --> 44:16.014
So the electric can't have
been off for very long.

44:17.150 --> 44:20.123
Funny the... fridge light.

44:23.230 --> 44:25.965
Don't you know how
long the power's been off?

44:25.967 --> 44:27.435
What?

44:27.437 --> 44:29.574
You said you didn't know
how long the power's been off.

44:29.576 --> 44:32.482
Didn't you notice
when it went off?

44:34.151 --> 44:35.821
No, didn't notice.

44:36.823 --> 44:37.657
Okay.

44:39.762 --> 44:42.434
Well, I've been out haven't I?

44:43.302 --> 44:45.605
What, in the cold?

44:45.607 --> 44:48.076
You said I was mad
being out in this.

44:48.078 --> 44:49.848
Yes, I've been out.

44:51.819 --> 44:54.324
Perhaps I was walking the dog.

44:58.500 --> 45:00.671
Hmm, nice cheese sandwich.

45:06.316 --> 45:08.821
Drink up before it evaporates.

45:09.856 --> 45:12.124
I think I've had enough.

45:12.126 --> 45:14.630
Listen, you look like I feel.

45:14.632 --> 45:17.000
And you need to sleep.

45:17.002 --> 45:20.443
It'll help you sleep so
don't waste it, drink it.

45:21.480 --> 45:24.352
I'm going to bed now anyway.

45:25.788 --> 45:28.894
Squinting at you through the
dark is giving me a headache.

45:30.095 --> 45:31.699
And I wouldn't sleep
there if I were you.

45:32.567 --> 45:34.035
Not with your arm as it is.

45:34.037 --> 45:35.738
Sleep in the spare bed
and get your strength back

45:35.740 --> 45:37.809
ready to leave first
thing in the morning.

45:37.811 --> 45:39.111
How's that sound?

45:39.113 --> 45:40.682
Great, thanks.

45:40.684 --> 45:44.557
The bedrooms are through
there and up the stairs.

45:44.559 --> 45:46.193
My one is the first
one on the left

45:46.195 --> 45:48.298
and you're right next door.

45:48.300 --> 45:49.799
All good?

45:49.801 --> 45:51.068
Mmhm.

45:51.070 --> 45:54.779
Okay, well, then I'll
bid you goodnight John.

45:57.049 --> 45:59.721
What name should I put on
the bill for your room?

46:03.397 --> 46:04.499
Um, Simons.

46:09.676 --> 46:10.511
Okay.

46:12.415 --> 46:15.287
Night night, John Simons.

46:49.988 --> 46:52.894
You see, I knew it
is, I was right.

46:57.069 --> 46:58.072
Oh no no no.

46:59.006 --> 47:00.777
Oh, don't let it disappear.

47:02.648 --> 47:04.084
I knew who he was.

47:15.306 --> 47:16.709
Now it's gone.

47:19.982 --> 47:22.387
I remembered something.

47:45.968 --> 47:50.142
That's mean, that's mean
taking it away like that.

48:28.986 --> 48:30.788
What's your
mother like John?

48:30.790 --> 48:32.526
I've not seen
her in a very long time.

48:32.528 --> 48:33.630
Do I know you?

48:34.231 --> 48:34.532
John.

48:35.266 --> 48:35.766
Lovely name.

48:39.274 --> 48:40.476
He's a test, isn't he?

52:38.151 --> 52:39.655
How sad.

55:30.797 --> 55:33.536
Now, do you see?

56:01.825 --> 56:04.362
Please, I will get better,

56:04.364 --> 56:06.433
I'll take my pills I promise.

57:34.343 --> 57:35.779
Can't he stay?

58:03.568 --> 58:04.370
No, no!

58:47.154 --> 58:48.189
Stretching your legs?

58:48.191 --> 58:50.795
I just needed some fresh air.

58:52.065 --> 58:53.333
Can I?

58:53.335 --> 58:55.471
I was just keeping
us warm, by the way.

58:55.473 --> 58:56.740
Last night when I
got into bed with you

58:56.742 --> 58:58.844
I was just keeping us warm.

58:58.846 --> 59:00.547
It was nothing dirty.

59:00.549 --> 59:01.651
Okay Joyce.

59:03.287 --> 59:04.323
Okay Joyce?

59:19.152 --> 59:22.325
See anything
interesting, in the shed?

59:23.762 --> 59:26.832
Why do children always sneak
around poking their noses?

59:26.834 --> 59:28.303
I'm not a child anymore Joyce.

59:28.305 --> 59:29.407
Is that so?

59:30.309 --> 59:31.542
I just wanted to see...

59:31.544 --> 59:35.585
To see, if I had
a car, a bicycle

59:36.554 --> 59:38.190
four elephants and a drum kit?

59:38.192 --> 59:40.696
Tell me, what were
you wanting to see?

59:41.298 --> 59:42.733
Please, Joyce.

59:44.135 --> 59:46.238
Mrs. Hadley, I think I'd
like to be called from now on.

59:46.240 --> 59:47.775
Thank you

59:47.777 --> 59:51.348
Joyce is too familiar
and you don't know me.

59:51.350 --> 59:53.621
Please Mrs. Hadley, try it.

59:56.093 --> 59:58.062
Please Mrs. Hadley.

59:58.064 --> 59:59.365
Thank you.

59:59.367 --> 01:00:02.070
Now, what is it that
you'd like to ask me?

01:00:02.072 --> 01:00:03.606
I'd like to ask...

01:00:03.608 --> 01:00:05.844
No, John, I think you'd
like to tell me something.

01:00:05.846 --> 01:00:06.680
Correct?

01:00:07.583 --> 01:00:08.550
Tell you?

01:00:08.552 --> 01:00:10.222
Yes John, tell me.

01:00:13.027 --> 01:00:15.696
Let's start with the
backpack, shall we?

01:00:15.698 --> 01:00:16.866
For instance, why it
never leaves your side

01:00:16.868 --> 01:00:18.705
not even for a moment.

01:00:19.907 --> 01:00:22.911
Although, that's not
strictly true is it?

01:00:22.913 --> 01:00:24.881
You didn't notice it
disappear for 10 minutes

01:00:24.883 --> 01:00:26.018
while you asleep, did you?

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:28.356
You've been through my things?

01:00:28.358 --> 01:00:32.398
No John, I haven't
been through your things

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.235
because none of what
is in that backpack

01:00:34.237 --> 01:00:36.104
belongs to you, does it?

01:00:36.106 --> 01:00:39.311
Unless you've lost a few
pound, gained a small child

01:00:39.313 --> 01:00:42.850
and look incredibly
young for 43.

01:00:42.852 --> 01:00:45.590
I didn't steal it if
that's what you think.

01:00:45.592 --> 01:00:47.162
Whose is it John?

01:00:48.365 --> 01:00:52.038
Who does it belong to
and how did you get it?

01:00:56.982 --> 01:01:01.156
You can stop this Joyce, you
need to open your eyes now.

01:01:06.668 --> 01:01:08.338
Look at the picture.

01:01:19.827 --> 01:01:21.664
Having trouble?

01:01:22.399 --> 01:01:23.565
Let me go Joyce,

01:01:23.567 --> 01:01:26.372
you don't wanna go
through all this again.

01:01:26.374 --> 01:01:27.975
Where d'you wanna go John?

01:01:27.977 --> 01:01:29.779
Let me leave Joyce.

01:01:29.781 --> 01:01:31.482
Open this door
for your own sake.

01:01:31.484 --> 01:01:33.252
Now, what sort of
person would I be

01:01:33.254 --> 01:01:34.889
if I simply let a
lying little thief

01:01:34.891 --> 01:01:36.426
loose into the community?

01:01:36.428 --> 01:01:37.927
What?

01:01:37.929 --> 01:01:41.268
I mean, I'd feel so guilty
just letting you walk out.

01:01:43.006 --> 01:01:44.174
Don't do this Joyce!

01:01:44.177 --> 01:01:45.142
What if you run off?

01:01:45.879 --> 01:01:46.812
Joyce!

01:01:46.814 --> 01:01:48.015
Or steal someone's passport?

01:01:48.851 --> 01:01:50.018
Or savings?

01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:51.054
Joyce, remember!

01:01:51.056 --> 01:01:53.327
It's Mrs. Fucking Hadley!

01:01:54.996 --> 01:01:57.867
Get him!

01:02:01.277 --> 01:02:02.680
Open this door!

01:02:04.081 --> 01:02:05.986
Open this fucking door!

01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:15.939
I'm done being calm.

01:02:17.809 --> 01:02:20.079
He wants to leave.

01:02:20.081 --> 01:02:22.586
Why does everyone wanna leave?

01:02:25.057 --> 01:02:29.232
Because
nobody could love you.

01:03:16.361 --> 01:03:18.431
Remember the gun Joyce.

01:03:19.467 --> 01:03:21.268
Remember what it did.

01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:24.807
Oh my God, don't
shoot me please John.

01:03:24.809 --> 01:03:26.778
You need to let me go.

01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:28.882
Please don't kill
me, I don't wanna die.

01:03:28.884 --> 01:03:30.786
I'm so sorry, please.

01:03:52.498 --> 01:03:56.339
Unless you're gonna club me
to death with the handle.

01:03:56.341 --> 01:04:00.515
But then, you're forgetting,
I'm still holding the poker.

01:04:13.742 --> 01:04:15.044
There's nowhere to go John.

01:04:16.481 --> 01:04:18.351
Everywhere is locked, you
should know that by now.

01:04:19.754 --> 01:04:21.857
That's
it, show him who's boss.

01:04:44.737 --> 01:04:46.071
That's better.

01:04:47.508 --> 01:04:50.816
See,
you're in control. You are.

01:05:00.902 --> 01:05:04.176
You don't need
to do this to me Joyce.

01:05:05.512 --> 01:05:08.750
Think about what's
happening, change things.

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:11.523
Don't listen to him.

01:05:12.123 --> 01:05:13.328
Joyce!

01:05:13.927 --> 01:05:14.796
Mrs. Hadley!

01:05:15.699 --> 01:05:17.436
Mrs. Hadley.

01:05:23.515 --> 01:05:24.213
You're
mommy's little darling

01:05:24.215 --> 01:05:25.049
aren't you?

01:05:25.919 --> 01:05:27.686
I'm sorry, okay.

01:05:27.688 --> 01:05:31.363
Whatever it is I've
done, I'm sorry, please.

01:05:32.798 --> 01:05:35.802
Whatever it is you've done?

01:05:35.804 --> 01:05:38.478
Whatever it is that you've done?

01:05:39.946 --> 01:05:44.121
You steal my husband's bag,
his money, his passport,

01:05:44.989 --> 01:05:46.824
then you break into my house.

01:05:46.826 --> 01:05:48.529
I didn't.

01:05:48.531 --> 01:05:51.969
The last couple of times I
was too young to make you see.

01:05:51.971 --> 01:05:55.108
But this time,
remember who I am!

01:05:55.110 --> 01:05:57.048
You took him from me.

01:05:57.915 --> 01:05:59.419
That's it Joyce.

01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:02.824
You're remembering.

01:06:02.826 --> 01:06:04.728
And now you want
to shoot me too!

01:06:04.730 --> 01:06:07.733
No, that's
not what's happened.

01:06:07.735 --> 01:06:09.771
Well I'm going
to defend myself.

01:06:09.773 --> 01:06:12.611
And no one is going
to blame me for it.

01:06:12.613 --> 01:06:14.950
No one will blame me at all!

01:06:21.696 --> 01:06:23.967
Get
that out of my face!

01:06:28.211 --> 01:06:32.385
Please, I need
you to understand.

01:06:34.856 --> 01:06:36.123
That's enough!

01:06:36.125 --> 01:06:38.561
Get out of my sight,
stupid little shit!

01:06:45.044 --> 01:06:46.146
Don't believe his lies.

01:06:52.224 --> 01:06:54.860
I'm going to punish you John.

01:06:54.862 --> 01:06:56.433
You know I have to.

01:07:27.429 --> 01:07:28.962
Where the hell is he?

01:07:38.015 --> 01:07:41.119
You better not be
trying to leave.

01:07:41.121 --> 01:07:43.226
I know what you're doing.

01:07:57.988 --> 01:08:01.361
Better watch that drop John,
you might break the other arm.

01:08:09.879 --> 01:08:11.282
Christ sake's, calm down.

01:08:11.884 --> 01:08:12.385
I am calm!

01:08:18.062 --> 01:08:21.100
Joyce, I don't
think I can stop this.

01:08:31.656 --> 01:08:33.225
You don't have to do this Joyce.

01:08:33.227 --> 01:08:34.460
There's still time to stop.

01:08:34.462 --> 01:08:35.464
Stop what?

01:08:37.268 --> 01:08:39.136
Who am I, say my name.

01:08:39.138 --> 01:08:39.970
You're John.

01:08:39.971 --> 01:08:41.374
I'm your John.

01:08:41.376 --> 01:08:42.975
- He's lying.
- No!

01:08:42.978 --> 01:08:45.247
My John was 10 years old.

01:08:45.250 --> 01:08:48.156
My John was a
conniving little boy.

01:08:49.591 --> 01:08:52.863
He made my husband hate
me, took him away from me.

01:08:52.865 --> 01:08:57.006
My John was a naughty,
spoiled little shit!

01:08:59.578 --> 01:09:01.247
Go to your room!

01:09:01.249 --> 01:09:03.350
No, I was just a little boy.

01:09:03.353 --> 01:09:06.857
A normal little boy,
me nine years ago.

01:09:08.697 --> 01:09:12.435
You can make this right,
please, let me leave.

01:09:12.438 --> 01:09:14.607
I can't, don't you understand?

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:17.578
It's the only thing
that stops the pain!

01:09:17.581 --> 01:09:20.318
Let the pain in,
go through the pain.

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:22.555
We can go through it together.

01:09:22.558 --> 01:09:26.666
It's hurts too
much, I'm too scared.

01:09:30.575 --> 01:09:32.410
You have to be punished!

01:09:32.412 --> 01:09:33.711
It's the way it is.

01:09:33.712 --> 01:09:35.381
It's the way it has to be.

01:09:35.384 --> 01:09:37.018
Time's up Joyce.

01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:38.121
Do it.

01:09:38.122 --> 01:09:39.125
I'm sorry.

01:09:40.394 --> 01:09:41.660
Do it.

01:10:09.118 --> 01:10:09.953
Hey.

01:10:11.889 --> 01:10:14.693
Yes, I can scrub up, can't I?

01:10:14.695 --> 01:10:16.199
What do you think?

01:10:22.278 --> 01:10:23.545
Too much?

01:10:23.547 --> 01:10:25.615
It's the lipstick isn't it?

01:10:25.617 --> 01:10:26.550
Or is it the hair?

01:10:26.552 --> 01:10:29.088
You prefer it down, don't you?

01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:30.758
Hey, I'm talking to you.

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:32.698
I need to look my best.

01:10:34.336 --> 01:10:35.335
Your best?

01:10:35.337 --> 01:10:37.373
Yes, I want to
look just right.

01:10:37.375 --> 01:10:39.212
Why am I still here?

01:10:41.415 --> 01:10:44.353
My husband is on his way
back, I want you to meet him.

01:10:44.355 --> 01:10:46.390
But he's dead.

01:10:46.392 --> 01:10:49.264
No, he's not, he's
coming home to me.

01:10:49.266 --> 01:10:51.767
Your husband is
dead, dad is dead.

01:10:51.769 --> 01:10:53.572
No, no, no, no, no.

01:10:53.574 --> 01:10:55.208
He's coming here, he
always comes here.

01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:56.578
You've just never seen him.

01:10:56.580 --> 01:10:58.383
You're not listening to me!

01:10:59.852 --> 01:11:03.393
You didn't hit me as hard
as you could have did you?

01:11:05.398 --> 01:11:07.265
You held back.

01:11:07.267 --> 01:11:08.502
Why Joyce?

01:11:08.504 --> 01:11:10.839
Stop, I don't
want you to talk.

01:11:10.841 --> 01:11:12.710
Tell me Joyce, why
did you hold back?

01:11:12.712 --> 01:11:14.280
Stop talking!

01:11:14.282 --> 01:11:16.083
I still have a choice,
it's still up to me

01:11:16.085 --> 01:11:17.720
so just shut up.

01:11:19.759 --> 01:11:21.125
You said your
husband is coming.

01:11:21.127 --> 01:11:22.596
What time is he arriving?

01:11:22.598 --> 01:11:24.834
Oh, what time is he arriving,
why don't you ever shut up?

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:29.111
What time is he arriving?

01:11:30.248 --> 01:11:31.681
What time is he arriving?

01:11:31.683 --> 01:11:32.516
What time?

01:11:32.518 --> 01:11:33.352
Is he arriving.

01:11:33.354 --> 01:11:34.519
I know, I heard you.

01:11:34.521 --> 01:11:35.788
Why do you want to
know, what's it to you?

01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:37.795
Oh I just wanna
know who's coming.

01:11:38.396 --> 01:11:38.930
You're right.

01:11:40.401 --> 01:11:44.409
I do prefer your hair down.

01:11:45.877 --> 01:11:48.381
You've got nice hair.

01:11:48.383 --> 01:11:50.985
It looks nice down.

01:11:51.789 --> 01:11:54.562
Yes, you always
did like it down.

01:11:56.164 --> 01:12:00.341
You always played with it
with your chubby little hands.

01:12:00.975 --> 01:12:01.643
I did wonder.

01:12:02.844 --> 01:12:04.113
Oh, don't move.

01:12:17.975 --> 01:12:21.647
Just a mild voltage Joyce.

01:12:21.649 --> 01:12:25.154
This'll
help. Like re-tuning a radio.

01:12:25.156 --> 01:12:27.729
Clearing the static.

01:12:53.579 --> 01:12:56.987
Have you
worked out what's happening?

01:13:00.159 --> 01:13:00.994
No.

01:13:03.064 --> 01:13:05.771
Still a head full
of nothingness.

01:13:16.493 --> 01:13:17.328
Yes?

01:13:19.666 --> 01:13:21.800
Yes of course she's one of mine.

01:13:21.802 --> 01:13:23.138
Well since when?

01:13:24.609 --> 01:13:26.376
Well, she's never supposed
to be unsupervised.

01:13:26.378 --> 01:13:28.883
I don't care how calm she was.

01:13:29.953 --> 01:13:31.021
Jesus Christ!

01:13:32.089 --> 01:13:33.659
What about the tag?

01:13:34.995 --> 01:13:35.830
No.

01:13:36.933 --> 01:13:37.869
I'll do it.

01:13:38.971 --> 01:13:40.708
I know where that is.

01:13:53.734 --> 01:13:55.369
You like my hair?

01:13:55.371 --> 01:13:57.071
You look very lovely.

01:13:57.073 --> 01:13:59.409
Your hair is lovely.

01:14:00.847 --> 01:14:02.951
What? What did you say?

01:14:04.822 --> 01:14:06.424
Focus, Joyce.

01:14:08.697 --> 01:14:10.130
Just listen to me.

01:14:10.132 --> 01:14:11.166
Joyce do it.

01:14:11.168 --> 01:14:12.602
There, you heard that.

01:14:12.604 --> 01:14:15.073
Stop it please, stop the pain!

01:14:15.075 --> 01:14:16.310
Ignore them Joyce.

01:14:16.312 --> 01:14:18.548
Just listen to me,
just your John.

01:14:19.686 --> 01:14:21.654
Stay with me Joyce please.

01:14:21.656 --> 01:14:24.594
No, you're supposed
to stay here.

01:14:24.596 --> 01:14:26.297
You boys wanted to leave me.

01:14:29.371 --> 01:14:33.042
You must do it.

01:14:33.044 --> 01:14:34.879
I don't want to.

01:14:34.881 --> 01:14:36.386
Fight it, Joyce.

01:14:39.625 --> 01:14:41.093
It's making me!

01:14:41.095 --> 01:14:44.101
Time's up Joyce.

01:14:45.237 --> 01:14:47.208
Stop the pain
please, it hurts me!

01:14:49.143 --> 01:14:50.780
It's not fair.

01:14:51.915 --> 01:14:53.920
Time's up Joyce.

01:15:00.098 --> 01:15:01.934
Time's up Joyce.

01:15:01.936 --> 01:15:03.137
Time's up Joyce.

01:15:03.139 --> 01:15:04.439
Time's up Joyce.

01:15:04.441 --> 01:15:05.410
Time's up.

01:15:07.681 --> 01:15:10.152
Hello? Joyce.

01:15:10.888 --> 01:15:12.324
One second darling.

01:15:13.325 --> 01:15:14.829
My husband's here.

01:15:17.702 --> 01:15:18.637
Oh darling.

01:15:19.839 --> 01:15:21.808
Oh thank goodness you're home.

01:15:21.810 --> 01:15:24.716
You'll never believe
what I've been through.

01:15:29.225 --> 01:15:30.427
I didn't kill him.

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:32.361
I didn't want to.

01:15:32.363 --> 01:15:34.433
They tried to make
me but I didn't, see?

01:15:34.435 --> 01:15:35.969
I'm fighting them.

01:15:35.971 --> 01:15:39.210
That's good,
you made a choice,

01:15:39.212 --> 01:15:41.814
a choice that you never
gave yourself before.

01:15:41.816 --> 01:15:42.749
I don't understand.

01:15:42.751 --> 01:15:43.819
Yes you do.

01:15:46.526 --> 01:15:48.730
Your family, you remember?

01:15:49.464 --> 01:15:51.168
Your husband, your son?

01:15:54.208 --> 01:15:56.510
Look, I know you've come
here to try to work through

01:15:56.512 --> 01:15:57.712
the pain of what happened,

01:15:57.714 --> 01:15:59.717
but I need to take
you back to the unit.

01:15:59.719 --> 01:16:01.621
But it's different this time.

01:16:01.623 --> 01:16:03.122
I made a choice.

01:16:03.124 --> 01:16:04.392
I did hit him, I'm sorry.

01:16:04.394 --> 01:16:05.162
I hit him.

01:16:06.565 --> 01:16:07.967
It's okay, mum.

01:16:13.479 --> 01:16:15.316
You came back to me.

01:16:19.691 --> 01:16:21.927
You're mommy's little
darling, aren't you?

01:16:33.186 --> 01:16:35.888
You're not my husband, are you?

01:16:35.890 --> 01:16:38.396
No, I'm your doctor.

01:16:39.764 --> 01:16:41.033
I'm Dr. Hadley.

01:16:57.133 --> 01:16:58.668
How are you feeling?

01:16:58.670 --> 01:17:01.239
Good, I'm feeling really good.

01:17:01.241 --> 01:17:02.409
Excellent.

01:17:02.411 --> 01:17:04.746
I knew this was a good idea.

01:17:04.748 --> 01:17:06.150
Bit of fresh air.

01:17:08.355 --> 01:17:11.160
This is my house, my retreat.

01:17:12.931 --> 01:17:14.632
I come here to unwind,

01:17:14.634 --> 01:17:17.205
get away from all the stress.

01:17:17.207 --> 01:17:18.608
It's beautiful.

01:17:18.610 --> 01:17:19.445
Mmm.

01:17:25.424 --> 01:17:29.431
If you ever need a bit
of air, a bit of space...

01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:39.349
I'm not Mrs. Hadley.

01:17:39.351 --> 01:17:40.186
No.

01:17:41.289 --> 01:17:44.762
You're Mrs. Simons,
Joyce Simons.

01:17:47.032 --> 01:17:49.470
No darling, please!

01:17:50.973 --> 01:17:54.547
I will get better, I will
take my pills I promise!

01:17:55.649 --> 01:17:57.887
My husband, he
wanted to leave me.

01:17:59.625 --> 01:18:01.025
Please, please don't do this.

01:18:01.027 --> 01:18:03.631
I will get better I promise.

01:18:03.633 --> 01:18:05.468
But he couldn't leave.

01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:07.004
I will take my pills
every single day.

01:18:07.006 --> 01:18:08.040
I will, I will, please!

01:18:08.042 --> 01:18:09.743
Couldn't stay either.

01:18:16.258 --> 01:18:18.761
Maybe he thought that
leaving John behind

01:18:18.763 --> 01:18:20.665
was some kind of consolation.

01:18:20.667 --> 01:18:24.004
That's enough, get out of
my sight stupid little shit!

01:18:27.848 --> 01:18:31.021
I blamed my son for my
husband shooting himself.

01:18:49.692 --> 01:18:50.527
My child.

01:18:52.231 --> 01:18:53.065
My son.

01:18:55.068 --> 01:18:58.242
You were so frightened
and I hurt you.

01:18:59.109 --> 01:19:00.011
I miss you.

01:19:01.883 --> 01:19:03.286
I miss you too.

01:19:04.454 --> 01:19:05.489
I'll be okay.

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:09.464
I'm sorry, John.

01:19:12.371 --> 01:19:13.806
I love you mum.

01:19:15.309 --> 01:19:17.314
I love you too my son.

01:19:37.153 --> 01:19:38.755
Is it over now?

01:19:39.491 --> 01:19:40.924
It's up to you.

01:19:40.926 --> 01:19:44.267
Maybe this is the last
time you need to come here.

01:20:19.203 --> 01:20:20.338
Can you let me in?

01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:22.107
No, go away?

01:20:22.109 --> 01:20:23.677
Can I just use
your phone or anything

01:20:23.679 --> 01:20:25.849
just for a minute, please?

01:20:30.092 --> 01:20:32.195
What do you want?

01:20:32.197 --> 01:20:34.130
Do you know what time
it is for God's sake?

01:20:34.132 --> 01:20:35.301
Please let me in.

01:20:35.303 --> 01:20:37.839
I think I busted my arm.

01:20:37.841 --> 01:20:38.676
Okay.

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:42.851
Well hurry before we
both freeze to death.

01:20:44.187 --> 01:20:45.488
I don't think
poking is gonna...

01:20:45.490 --> 01:20:47.526
I'm not going to poke it!

01:20:49.365 --> 01:20:50.199
I'm sorry.

01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:05.012
I want to talk about
what I did to my son.

01:22:05.014 --> 01:22:06.149
I'm ready now.

01:22:19.176 --> 01:22:22.115
You don't
need me anymore.

01:22:36.423 --> 01:22:41.423
