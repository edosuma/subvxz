00:00.042 --> 00:02.251
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...

00:02.292 --> 00:04.917
- Someone's killing witches.
- Aah! Aah!

00:06.459 --> 00:08.061
I still haven't found my story.

00:08.083 --> 00:09.875
Or maybe I did, but I
still have to fight for it.

00:10.002 --> 00:11.434
Gotcha.

00:11.459 --> 00:13.456
I just had to see your
face one last time.

00:13.481 --> 00:15.572
We'll always know each
other, even if we don't.

00:17.676 --> 00:19.042
He didn't see me.

00:19.144 --> 00:20.310
Well, you're kind of hard to miss.

00:20.412 --> 00:22.412
Rogers. Good luck on that case.

00:22.514 --> 00:26.316
I'm betting the answer
is right under your nose.

00:32.209 --> 00:34.292
This is it. Just ahead.

00:34.359 --> 00:36.092
The cave of the Golden Dragon.

00:36.194 --> 00:37.704
By the size of those claw marks,

00:37.709 --> 00:39.210
I'd say it's well-fed on heroes.

00:39.254 --> 00:41.377
You sure you want to do this?

00:41.400 --> 00:42.513
You kidding?

00:42.538 --> 00:44.346
I've wanted to do this
since I was 10 years old.

00:44.459 --> 00:46.584
You ready?

00:46.605 --> 00:48.304
One last thing for good luck.

00:50.027 --> 00:51.247
I don't need luck.

00:51.292 --> 00:53.666
Slaying dragons is what
my family does best.

00:53.667 --> 00:54.682
Now come on.

00:54.707 --> 00:56.440
We're so close, I can hear it breathing.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.250
Hey.

01:15.834 --> 01:17.126
Hey. Who are you?

01:17.160 --> 01:19.861
Whoa. Watch where you poke that.

01:19.929 --> 01:20.928
I'm trying to take a bit of a nap.

01:21.030 --> 01:22.437
Here? You mad?

01:22.462 --> 01:23.933
Where's the bloody dragon?

01:23.958 --> 01:27.134
Are you serious?

01:27.237 --> 01:30.771
You think I'd be here
if there was a dragon?

01:30.874 --> 01:32.940
The dragon migrated weeks ago.

01:32.959 --> 01:37.585
Left his treasures
behind... gold, silver, wine.

01:37.647 --> 01:39.647
I didn't even know dragons like wine.

01:39.672 --> 01:41.041
Want some?

01:41.066 --> 01:42.098
That's not yours.

01:42.123 --> 01:44.285
It belongs to the villages
that dragon plundered,

01:44.387 --> 01:46.940
so you are leaving right now.

01:46.965 --> 01:48.998
I do have that effect on women.

01:49.626 --> 01:50.544
All right.

01:52.762 --> 01:54.829
Why the glum face, lad?

01:54.931 --> 01:57.465
Dragon's gone. It is a good thing.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.166
Not for me.

01:59.269 --> 02:01.836
My mom and grandpa both slayed
a dragon with this sword.

02:01.938 --> 02:04.205
Well, there will be
other days, other dragons.

02:04.307 --> 02:05.940
No, it's not just about a dragon.

02:06.042 --> 02:09.130
I'm in love with Cinderella.
What do I have to offer her?

02:09.155 --> 02:11.232
My grandparents are Snow
White and Prince Charming,

02:11.281 --> 02:14.115
and I'm still just...

02:14.217 --> 02:16.417
I'm just Henry.

02:16.486 --> 02:19.186
I came here to find my
story, and I refuse to believe

02:19.289 --> 02:21.822
that I'm just a character
in someone else's.

02:22.926 --> 02:24.625
You know, my grandparents
had a magic ring

02:24.727 --> 02:26.694
that helped them find each
other, and I don't need that.

02:26.796 --> 02:28.329
But if I'm going to propose
to Ella, I need to have

02:28.431 --> 02:31.532
a ring with a great
story behind it, my story.

02:37.125 --> 02:38.667
Is that really what you came here for?

02:39.129 --> 02:41.563
A ring to put on Ella's hand?

02:43.167 --> 02:44.209
Henry.

02:46.516 --> 02:48.249
If you want to quest after a ring,

02:48.351 --> 02:49.717
talk to the expert.

02:49.819 --> 02:52.353
On each of these rings
hangs a fantastic tale,

02:52.455 --> 02:53.594
and it just so happens,

02:53.619 --> 02:55.853
I know where you can
find one of your own.

03:18.214 --> 03:19.413
Uh, hey there.

03:19.515 --> 03:21.212
Is Roni around?

03:21.286 --> 03:24.054
Roni's actually been MIA all morning.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.886
Is there something I can help you with?

03:25.955 --> 03:28.122
Uh, just tell her Henry came by. Thanks.

03:28.191 --> 03:31.058
Oh! Wait, you're Henry Mills?

03:31.094 --> 03:32.159
I'm sorry.

03:32.261 --> 03:33.427
It's just that Roni
told me all about you,

03:33.463 --> 03:34.729
so I listened to your podcast.

03:34.797 --> 03:35.696
It's actually kind of great.

03:35.798 --> 03:37.498
Everyone in here talks about it.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.300
Wow. Yeah, thanks.

03:39.402 --> 03:42.169
Yeah, it's actually getting
a pretty good response.

03:42.205 --> 03:44.796
Who knows? Maybe even one
day, I'll get paid for it.

03:44.897 --> 03:46.396
It was nice to meet you, Henry.

03:46.421 --> 03:47.708
Yeah.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Nick!

03:57.459 --> 03:59.043
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:59.374 --> 04:00.907
Everything all right?

04:00.932 --> 04:01.864
Is it that obvious?

04:04.293 --> 04:06.293
Well, the truth is, I, uh, tried to land

04:06.362 --> 04:07.795
an important client last night,

04:07.897 --> 04:08.863
and she got away.

04:08.965 --> 04:10.898
Ah.

04:10.967 --> 04:13.768
That sucks. I'm sorry.

04:13.836 --> 04:16.184
But you'll land on your
feet. Just give it time.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.005
You know, I think you might be right.

04:18.107 --> 04:19.707
I'll find another client.

04:20.082 --> 04:21.142
You know, you're not the only weirdo

04:21.209 --> 04:22.209
that believes in signs.

04:22.278 --> 04:24.111
I... I think it's in our darkest hours

04:24.213 --> 04:26.547
that the universe
shows us our true path.

04:28.384 --> 04:29.950
That might be the universe calling.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.083
Better answer that.

04:32.188 --> 04:33.387
Hello?

04:33.456 --> 04:35.423
Yeah, this is Henry.

04:36.642 --> 04:37.758
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.

04:37.783 --> 04:38.742
Of course I can hold.

04:38.767 --> 04:39.694
Everything cool?

04:39.796 --> 04:41.829
Yeah, this is about the podcast.

04:44.584 --> 04:45.667
Four crime scenes,

04:45.768 --> 04:47.835
not a single footprint
or one strand of hair.

04:47.904 --> 04:49.303
Well, the killer's certainly meticulous.

04:49.405 --> 04:51.138
I'll give him that.

04:53.910 --> 04:56.010
I'm surprised Ivy made
it out of here alive.

04:56.079 --> 04:58.079
So she left town for good, huh?

04:58.104 --> 04:59.038
Smart girl.

04:59.063 --> 05:00.848
Smart and extremely lucky.

05:00.917 --> 05:02.417
The next victim may not be.

05:02.442 --> 05:04.081
Well, whatever cracks this case open,

05:04.106 --> 05:05.136
we're not gonna find it here.

05:05.161 --> 05:06.721
Anyway, I have to get Tilly to work.

05:06.823 --> 05:08.389
Since when did Tilly have a job?

05:08.491 --> 05:10.458
Since she's eaten
everything in my fridge.

05:10.526 --> 05:13.360
Do you have any idea how
expensive organic marmalade is?

05:13.463 --> 05:15.129
Well, it's criminal, so I got her a gig.

05:15.231 --> 05:16.130
Today's her first day.

05:16.199 --> 05:17.131
We'll see how that goes.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.614
You don't sound too confident.

05:18.639 --> 05:19.427
Of course I'm not.

05:19.452 --> 05:20.901
Tilly hasn't worked a
real job in her life.

05:20.970 --> 05:22.069
I just feel like I need to help her,

05:22.138 --> 05:23.734
like I am responsible.

05:23.759 --> 05:24.925
It's hard to explain.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.774
You don't have to explain.

05:26.876 --> 05:28.442
Tilly's a special girl,

05:28.544 --> 05:30.472
and I think she's gonna surprise you.

05:30.497 --> 05:31.779
Yeah.

05:31.881 --> 05:33.314
All right.

05:49.112 --> 05:50.898
Wow.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.667
I never thought a magic
potion would smell this good.

05:53.736 --> 05:55.636
Well, sorry to burst
your adorable bubble,

05:55.671 --> 05:57.304
but it's not a magic potion.

05:57.406 --> 05:58.405
Not yet.

05:58.474 --> 06:00.341
Until Roni finds the last ingredient,

06:00.409 --> 06:03.118
it's more like a
glorified vegetable stock.

06:03.143 --> 06:04.411
What if Roni can't find

06:04.480 --> 06:06.947
that weird moss stuff she's looking for?

06:06.983 --> 06:11.039
Then your dad stays poisoned,
and we never break the curse.

06:13.122 --> 06:15.489
Sorry. That was a bit blunt.

06:15.558 --> 06:17.558
It's... been a while
since I was around kids.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.894
Yeah. You're really bad at it.

06:19.996 --> 06:21.629
I'm trying my best.

06:21.697 --> 06:23.931
I know, it's just... I want
to break this curse now.

06:24.033 --> 06:26.400
I hate keeping secrets from my mom.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.068
It sucks.

06:28.171 --> 06:29.203
I get it.

06:29.305 --> 06:31.372
I mean, I begged Margot to fly back home

06:31.440 --> 06:34.275
because I'd changed, but...
as soon as she got here,

06:34.377 --> 06:36.710
I realized I couldn't
tell her about any of it.

06:36.779 --> 06:38.478
I mean, she'd lock me
up in the looney bin,

06:38.503 --> 06:40.548
so I lied to her.

06:40.616 --> 06:43.551
And you're right. It sucks.

06:43.653 --> 06:46.420
You want to break this
curse as much as I do, huh?

06:47.083 --> 06:50.584
You have no idea.

06:51.287 --> 06:53.147
Jacinda, I'm glad you're here.

06:53.201 --> 06:54.428
I just got this call from Siren Media.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.297
It's this big-time podcast producer.

06:56.375 --> 06:57.458
They love "H-Town."

06:57.500 --> 06:58.499
They want to offer me a job.

06:58.601 --> 06:59.533
You must be so excited!

06:59.584 --> 07:00.584
Yeah, I'm still... Still processing

07:00.709 --> 07:01.876
- 'cause it's all happening so fast,
- Yeah.

07:01.971 --> 07:05.013
but they want to meet
in New York tomorrow,

07:05.084 --> 07:08.442
and if it goes well,
the job's sort of mine.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.490
So they pay you to
keep making "H-Town"?

07:10.545 --> 07:11.679
Well, no, not exactly.

07:11.747 --> 07:13.047
They are going to pay me

07:13.149 --> 07:15.616
to produce other people's podcasts.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.503
But you could still
make "H-Town," right?

07:17.581 --> 07:18.970
This could be, like, your side thing.

07:18.995 --> 07:21.622
Yeah, well, actually,
I'd have to give that up,

07:21.691 --> 07:24.191
um, because I can
only keep making H-Town

07:24.260 --> 07:27.394
if I'm living here, and
if I take this job...

07:27.496 --> 07:29.651
I sort of have to move to New York.

07:29.901 --> 07:31.267
Oh, wow.

07:31.292 --> 07:32.299
Yeah.

07:32.401 --> 07:34.001
New York, huh?

07:34.464 --> 07:36.737
It's... great. It's crazy.

07:36.839 --> 07:39.840
Totally crazy, I know.
So I'm just, um...

07:39.909 --> 07:43.766
you know, I'm just... I'm
trying to figure out what I want.

07:44.102 --> 07:46.680
If it's a good career move,

07:46.782 --> 07:49.016
then I guess you got to go for it.

07:49.547 --> 07:51.285
Yeah.

07:52.292 --> 07:54.043
Yeah. Yeah.

07:54.332 --> 07:56.324
Um...

07:56.893 --> 07:58.659
Yeah, I guess I do.

07:58.761 --> 08:01.465
Um, I guess I should get packing.

08:01.542 --> 08:02.751
- Yeah.
- Right?

08:04.267 --> 08:07.735
Um, hey.

08:08.913 --> 08:11.804
Thanks... for everything.

08:12.491 --> 08:14.069
Yeah.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.417
Detective Weaver.

08:53.507 --> 08:54.906
You here to give me another black eye?

08:54.990 --> 08:56.240
Maybe the left one this time?

08:56.366 --> 08:58.075
I apologize for our first meeting.

08:58.199 --> 09:00.574
Since then, I have made
significant changes to my life.

09:00.647 --> 09:02.156
Whatever you want, make it quick.

09:02.181 --> 09:03.086
I've got a plane to catch.

09:03.111 --> 09:05.927
I want to take a
problem off the streets,

09:05.952 --> 09:07.618
and I can't do that without your help.

09:07.643 --> 09:09.220
I assume you've heard
of the Candy Killer?

09:09.322 --> 09:10.922
Rogers told me a little bit.

09:11.024 --> 09:11.956
Sounds super-creepy,

09:12.058 --> 09:13.448
and I definitely can't help you with it.

09:13.584 --> 09:15.876
Well, actually, you're
the only one who can.

09:16.209 --> 09:20.085
It turns out this killer
is a huge fan of your work.

09:23.888 --> 09:25.806
We found this at the crime scene.

09:40.954 --> 09:42.720
So, this is where I'm
supposed to find my adventure?

09:46.126 --> 09:48.415
I don't think bar fights really count.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.650
I assure you, our
adventure's close at hand.

09:50.709 --> 09:51.792
Soon, we'll be sailing

09:51.850 --> 09:53.991
after the greatest
treasure on the seven seas.

09:56.221 --> 09:58.321
Which is what?

09:58.920 --> 10:00.952
Davy Jones' Locker.

10:00.983 --> 10:03.026
It's an ancient treasure
chest buried beneath the waves.

10:03.094 --> 10:06.462
Every pirate seeks it, but
only Captain Hook has the map.

10:06.531 --> 10:07.430
Found it a few years ago.

10:07.532 --> 10:08.765
I thought maybe I could trade it

10:08.867 --> 10:10.933
for a cure for my poisoned heart,

10:11.239 --> 10:12.572
but it's brought me no luck.

10:12.597 --> 10:14.404
Perhaps it will bring you some.

10:19.834 --> 10:21.001
Thank you.

10:21.496 --> 10:23.934
Okay, so when do we set sail?

10:24.030 --> 10:24.995
Where's the Jolly Roger?

10:25.020 --> 10:27.192
Ah. That's why we're here.

10:27.723 --> 10:29.819
I left Mr. Smee in
charge of the Jolly Roger,

10:29.921 --> 10:34.123
but... but Blackbeard proved
more than his match in battle,

10:34.192 --> 10:36.826
and now I'm afraid my
ship is in his hands.

10:40.033 --> 10:45.501
Pirate scum, the Jolly
Roger needs able-bodied men,

10:45.876 --> 10:47.585
but keep in mind,

10:47.639 --> 10:49.605
if you're a mean drunkard

10:49.674 --> 10:54.677
with nothing to offer but a
temper and a thieving heart,

10:54.779 --> 10:56.729
then you're exactly who I'm looking for!

10:58.834 --> 11:03.668
First men on board have a chance
to live and die at my hand!

11:03.699 --> 11:05.655
Move your asses!

11:06.629 --> 11:07.604
So, wait.

11:07.629 --> 11:09.425
The only way to get my ring is to join

11:09.527 --> 11:10.960
Captain Blackbeard's crew?

11:11.062 --> 11:12.562
Ah, no, he'd recognize me.

11:12.664 --> 11:15.241
And, no offense, I don't
think he'd pick you.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.415
No.

11:16.440 --> 11:20.109
We're going to sneak aboard
and take my Roger back.

11:25.876 --> 11:27.876
Don't be nervous. You're
going to love this job.

11:27.925 --> 11:30.613
But I am nervous. I can't just not be.

11:30.682 --> 11:32.215
Well, then, don't act so nervous.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.918
- And stop chewing your nails!
- Ugh!

11:34.042 --> 11:36.042
You're being very imperious today!

11:36.062 --> 11:37.943
Maybe you're the nervous one.

11:37.968 --> 11:40.323
I had to pull in a big
favor to get this job

11:40.392 --> 11:41.657
since I happen to know

11:41.760 --> 11:44.193
you have a taste for this type of thing.

11:47.584 --> 11:50.460
Hey! There's my little protégé.

11:55.709 --> 11:57.335
- Hi.
- You must be Tilly.

11:57.409 --> 11:59.642
Rogers tells me you're
a big fan of my work.

12:00.292 --> 12:02.353
Our other guy Drew, he works even days.

12:02.456 --> 12:03.789
You can work odd.

12:03.814 --> 12:06.215
Well, I like odd things, so that's good.

12:06.317 --> 12:07.603
Thank you.

12:07.673 --> 12:09.786
Happy to help out my favorite detective.

12:09.854 --> 12:13.756
And it just so happens I have
his favorite order all ready.

12:13.825 --> 12:16.292
Well, if that's how this works,

12:16.394 --> 12:18.013
I might have to drop her off more often.

12:18.038 --> 12:18.928
You might

12:18.997 --> 12:21.297
because I have a feeling
she's gonna do great.

12:21.417 --> 12:23.751
Come on. Let's go.

12:32.111 --> 12:33.486
Okay, now, you go home,

12:33.501 --> 12:35.460
and I will call you as soon
as Roni gets back, okay?

12:35.502 --> 12:36.546
Okay.

12:39.784 --> 12:40.750
Who was that?

12:40.804 --> 12:44.049
That was, um, Lucy, a friend's kid.

12:44.155 --> 12:47.023
She was working on a school
project, and I was helping her.

12:47.091 --> 12:48.925
Thought you were doing inventory.

12:49.027 --> 12:50.460
I was doing both.

12:50.562 --> 12:52.695
Now enough with the
third degree, please.

12:54.579 --> 12:56.999
Mom, what the hell is going on with you?

12:57.101 --> 12:58.801
I came back because
you said on the phone

12:58.903 --> 13:01.003
that you made all of
these big life changes,

13:01.105 --> 13:03.272
but now that I'm here,
you're all closed off.

13:03.374 --> 13:05.443
Honestly, I don't even know
why you wanted me to come back.

13:06.170 --> 13:08.325
Look, I just need you to be patient.

13:08.350 --> 13:10.813
Okay, then help me understand.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.415
Why are you working at the bar again?

13:12.517 --> 13:15.284
What happened to San Francisco
and your job, the wedding?

13:15.353 --> 13:16.719
Just stop interrogating me.

13:16.821 --> 13:17.887
You're impossible.

13:17.989 --> 13:19.755
Do you know why I left
in the first place?

13:19.858 --> 13:22.574
Because you and I... we've
never been able to communicate.

13:22.600 --> 13:23.799
That's not true.

13:23.972 --> 13:26.362
Okay. Go ahead. Prove it.

13:26.464 --> 13:28.297
This is your big chance.

13:28.399 --> 13:30.166
Tell me what's going on with you.

13:35.626 --> 13:37.210
I can't.

13:37.308 --> 13:39.275
Just not now, but, please, be patient.

13:39.377 --> 13:41.670
You know what? I am done
being patient with you.

13:41.740 --> 13:44.080
All I've ever done is
wait for you to change.

13:44.182 --> 13:46.682
You know what? I never
should have come back.

14:05.751 --> 14:08.210
Well, this place is
appropriately creepy.

14:08.339 --> 14:09.800
Let's just make this quick, okay?

14:09.869 --> 14:11.135
I'm trying to catch a plane.

14:11.160 --> 14:12.894
And I'm trying to catch a killer.

14:12.949 --> 14:14.752
I believe that takes precedence.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.754
This is life or death. I get it. Okay.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.423
It's just that this
is really bad timing.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.792
I got an interview in New York tomorrow.

14:21.649 --> 14:23.626
New York?

14:23.930 --> 14:26.197
Well, that's a long way from home.

14:27.290 --> 14:29.046
Bit of a change.

14:29.071 --> 14:31.369
Yeah, the thing is, I'm
here to talk about the case,

14:31.404 --> 14:33.705
not my life choices, thanks very much.

14:33.773 --> 14:35.540
Now tell me what I do with this.

14:35.837 --> 14:37.336
Okay, you need to find out

14:37.365 --> 14:39.143
what the killer saw in your stories

14:39.245 --> 14:41.279
because, clearly, they think they saw

14:41.348 --> 14:43.717
something real and true.

14:43.897 --> 14:45.149
Look deep inside them,

14:45.251 --> 14:47.752
and tell me where the truth lies.

15:18.618 --> 15:21.119
Yeah, I definitely smell like pork.

15:21.187 --> 15:22.487
Let's never do that again.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.257
Agreed.

15:24.296 --> 15:26.891
Hopefully, they won't smell you coming.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.250
Turn around.

15:46.706 --> 15:47.972
Captain!

15:47.997 --> 15:50.381
Shh, shh, shh, shh! Quiet, Mr. Smee.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.050
I'm sorry I let
Blackbeard take the Roger.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.351
Look, you can apologize later.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.019
How many men are still loyal to me?

15:55.121 --> 15:59.666
There's me, um, Hudson the
Cook, uh, and One Eye Jack.

15:59.751 --> 16:01.160
- Oh.
- Maybe.

16:01.161 --> 16:02.193
Hmm.

16:02.262 --> 16:03.327
What? That's it?

16:03.430 --> 16:05.096
I thought you said the crew loved you.

16:05.182 --> 16:06.597
Well, what I meant was
that they will love me

16:06.699 --> 16:09.867
after they learn that I have
the map to Davy Jones' Locker.

16:09.936 --> 16:13.337
But you don't have the map, Captain.

16:15.341 --> 16:16.474
I do.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.042
Poor Captain Hook.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.511
Brought low by a man he despises.

16:20.875 --> 16:24.259
First, I-I took his
ship and then his map,

16:24.284 --> 16:28.156
and, uh, pretty soon,
I'll take his life.

16:28.226 --> 16:30.231
Ooh, big words.

16:30.256 --> 16:31.638
It's a shame you don't
make good on them.

16:31.685 --> 16:32.974
One more word,

16:33.028 --> 16:35.026
and your foul-smelling
friend here dies!

16:35.095 --> 16:36.622
Oh, you don't want to do that.

16:36.677 --> 16:38.614
You can't go around killing royalty,

16:38.661 --> 16:41.566
and this here... is Prince
Henry of Storybrooke.

16:44.417 --> 16:45.751
Oh.

16:46.816 --> 16:47.982
Very well.

16:48.565 --> 16:50.032
In that case,

16:50.057 --> 16:52.443
set a course for Davy Jones' Locker.

16:52.512 --> 16:55.377
And, uh, once we know the map is real,

16:55.885 --> 16:58.632
we'll offer the sharks a royal meal.

17:01.757 --> 17:03.279
I think my beignets are getting better.

17:03.304 --> 17:04.637
This one's heart-shaped.

17:04.843 --> 17:09.227
Yeah, well, we want them to be
a little more beignet-shaped.

17:10.375 --> 17:11.458
I'll tell you what.

17:11.481 --> 17:13.438
How about you work out front instead?

17:13.523 --> 17:15.833
You think you can sell
beignets to the masses?

17:15.902 --> 17:17.902
Selling comes natural to me.

17:18.462 --> 17:20.938
I could sell land to a fish.

17:21.626 --> 17:23.544
Oh, sorry, excuse me.

17:24.611 --> 17:25.742
Why is Tilly here?

17:25.811 --> 17:29.013
Hopefully, she's going to
join our beignet brigade.

17:29.417 --> 17:32.001
- Beignet?
- Jury's still out, though, but, um...

17:32.082 --> 17:34.127
you seem like you are not in the mood.

17:34.167 --> 17:37.584
My Spidey-sense says you
are having some boy troubles?

17:37.657 --> 17:40.691
Henry... he's got this
new job offer in New York

17:40.760 --> 17:42.939
and he asked me if he should go,

17:42.994 --> 17:45.658
and I sort of told him yes.

17:45.709 --> 17:47.876
- What? Why?
- I don't know.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.934
But I can't stop him
from following his career.

17:50.036 --> 17:51.707
He wanted you to stop him.

17:51.769 --> 17:53.271
That's why he told you.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.830
Now call him before
he gets on that plane,

17:55.855 --> 17:58.342
or you are going to regret
this for a very long time.

18:09.157 --> 18:10.656
I can't do this.

18:10.681 --> 18:12.548
You know why I wrote this
book in the first place?

18:12.626 --> 18:15.001
Because I thought that these
stories would give people hope.

18:15.092 --> 18:16.657
And now, some psychopath is using it

18:16.682 --> 18:18.248
as a reason to kill people?

18:18.273 --> 18:19.372
Not if you stop them.

18:19.397 --> 18:21.199
Stop putting that on me, okay?

18:21.267 --> 18:22.800
I don't... I don't have any answers.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.569
I don't have the secret
codes to these stories

18:24.671 --> 18:26.750
because it turns out, I
don't even understand them.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.508
Hey, what are you doing?

18:30.976 --> 18:33.483
I'm getting on a plane.

18:33.508 --> 18:35.179
You're right. New York
is a long way from home.

18:35.281 --> 18:38.249
And you know what? That's
probably a good thing

18:38.458 --> 18:40.858
because nothing here
really worked out so great.

18:42.322 --> 18:45.223
And yet, we both know you're
not really walking out that door.

18:45.402 --> 18:46.701
Not if you're anything
like the Henry Mills

18:46.726 --> 18:48.693
in that book, you're not.

18:48.795 --> 18:49.827
You read the book?

18:49.929 --> 18:51.095
Yes, I did.

18:51.443 --> 18:53.477
And I wouldn't dismiss
those stories just yet.

18:53.502 --> 18:55.766
You see, even though you can't admit it,

18:55.868 --> 18:59.403
I think you're quite a
lot like your namesake.

18:59.599 --> 19:01.733
He was my favorite character.

19:03.542 --> 19:04.792
Of course he was.

19:04.844 --> 19:07.438
Everyone loves a little
kid full of hope and belief.

19:07.469 --> 19:09.780
Yeah, I didn't like him because
he was full of hope and belief.

19:09.882 --> 19:12.094
I liked him because he
fought for those things.

19:12.157 --> 19:15.386
And I can tell you're
not giving up just yet.

19:17.681 --> 19:19.223
Okay, what's funny?

19:19.292 --> 19:20.188
You're right.

19:20.228 --> 19:21.559
I am a lot like the Henry in the book.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.095
I wrote myself into it to
connect with the stories.

19:34.209 --> 19:36.751
I think that the killer
is doing the same thing.

19:36.850 --> 19:39.287
They think they're a
character in the book.

19:39.428 --> 19:41.746
Now we're getting somewhere.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.881
So all you have to figure out is,

19:43.983 --> 19:46.350
which character are we looking for?

19:59.513 --> 20:01.722
Well, Prince Henry,
you'll be as amazed as I am

20:01.844 --> 20:04.053
to find your washed-up old pirate

20:04.078 --> 20:06.335
actually led us to Davy Jones' locker.

20:07.282 --> 20:12.373
Oh, and to a watery grave
for all three of you.

20:13.399 --> 20:17.245
Let's have a look at what
we've stolen from Davy Jones.

20:21.792 --> 20:23.084
Oh, good Lord.

20:24.974 --> 20:27.407
There it is.

20:27.510 --> 20:31.044
The Star Sapphire of Davy Jones.

20:31.558 --> 20:33.958
The ring with which he
took his pirate bride

20:34.042 --> 20:38.834
and now a worthy addition
to the legend of Blackbeard,

20:39.388 --> 20:41.403
scourge of the sea,

20:41.591 --> 20:43.692
the elegant duke,

20:43.880 --> 20:47.060
the crown prince of plunder,

20:47.391 --> 20:49.992
the baron of looting...

20:50.055 --> 20:53.567
I stubbed my boot on this
nail a thousand times.

20:53.636 --> 20:56.103
It's about time it proved useful.

20:59.373 --> 21:01.152
You want an adventure, lad?

21:01.177 --> 21:02.106
Now's your chance.

21:02.131 --> 21:03.638
Go and get yourself that ring.

21:08.792 --> 21:10.584
Get him on his blind side!

21:10.639 --> 21:11.752
Watch out on your left there!

21:11.820 --> 21:13.826
Eyes on the blades, boy!

21:20.167 --> 21:21.250
You're a quick lad.

21:21.300 --> 21:23.934
But are you quicker than
the legendary Blackbeard?

21:29.125 --> 21:30.792
Clearly, yes, I am.

21:33.122 --> 21:34.522
Enough!

21:41.647 --> 21:43.047
Now give.

21:43.690 --> 21:45.087
Next time we meet,

21:45.112 --> 21:47.023
you won't be getting
such a fine gift as this

21:47.084 --> 21:48.717
for your bride.

21:50.772 --> 21:52.601
Wait. How do you know about a bride?

22:05.167 --> 22:06.501
This was a set-up?

22:06.583 --> 22:07.852
Is any of this real?

22:07.923 --> 22:09.964
Well, the treasure is.

22:11.518 --> 22:13.814
Let's just split it
three ways and go home.

22:13.916 --> 22:15.816
A deal's a deal, Hook.

22:17.751 --> 22:19.502
Meaningless.

22:19.881 --> 22:21.180
The Captain Hook I knew

22:21.205 --> 22:22.362
never would have made a fool of me.

22:22.432 --> 22:23.633
I know, lad.

22:23.658 --> 22:24.626
It seems like the other Captain Hook

22:24.651 --> 22:25.782
was always helping you,

22:25.792 --> 22:28.001
and I thought if I
helped you with this, then

22:28.083 --> 22:32.875
maybe I... I don't know.

22:34.003 --> 22:36.370
Hook, I'm sorry, but I
came to find my real story.

22:36.459 --> 22:38.168
A fake adventure doesn't help.

22:38.183 --> 22:39.683
Lad, it looks like this adventure

22:39.708 --> 22:40.841
is about to get less fake.

22:44.709 --> 22:47.126
I've never seen a
storm blow up like this.

22:47.149 --> 22:49.944
No captain alive could
steer us out of this.

22:50.083 --> 22:51.333
I'll take up that challenge,

22:51.334 --> 22:52.794
and you can stop
pretending to be captain.

22:52.836 --> 22:54.035
Man your stations!

22:54.060 --> 22:55.355
Hey. You know how to sail?

22:55.457 --> 22:57.669
Yeah, the other you taught me.

22:58.302 --> 22:59.309
Then grab a robe.

22:59.334 --> 23:00.460
We got to get out of here!

23:22.651 --> 23:24.553
How's our newest detective doing?

23:24.639 --> 23:26.386
Time will tell.

23:27.350 --> 23:28.364
Hey, hey.

23:28.389 --> 23:29.910
I think I got something. Look.

23:31.860 --> 23:34.194
Okay, in most of the chapters,

23:34.229 --> 23:36.296
it seems like they're studying the book,

23:36.398 --> 23:38.932
but in this one chapter,
they corrected it.

23:39.034 --> 23:41.368
This is my version of the
Hansel and Gretel story,

23:41.437 --> 23:44.119
but look what the killer wrote on it...

23:44.290 --> 23:47.626
"No happily ever after! Remember Gretel.

23:47.822 --> 23:49.283
Ovens make the deepest burns,"

23:49.329 --> 23:51.645
which, you know, that's
pretty disturbing.

23:51.714 --> 23:55.082
Um, oh, look, also
they underlined "twins."

23:55.184 --> 23:56.717
Wait, so the killer thinks

23:56.819 --> 23:59.252
that he's living in the
Hansel and Gretel story?

23:59.353 --> 24:01.734
And in their version, Gretel died.

24:01.759 --> 24:03.939
So, in our killer's mind,

24:04.877 --> 24:09.129
he's Hansel avenging his sister's death.

24:09.515 --> 24:11.663
Also, he's obsessed with scars,

24:11.694 --> 24:14.280
so maybe there was a fire
or something in real life.

24:14.343 --> 24:15.560
Nice work.

24:15.585 --> 24:18.272
We can take a look at
people with existing records,

24:18.364 --> 24:19.997
find the ones with
sisters, especially twins,

24:20.083 --> 24:21.458
and cross-reference scars.

24:21.501 --> 24:22.607
I'll get started.

24:22.632 --> 24:23.887
We find our killer,

24:23.912 --> 24:26.313
you're gonna have one
hell of a story to tell.

24:30.209 --> 24:32.626
So, I suppose it's finally time

24:32.791 --> 24:34.191
for you to catch your flight.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.442
Oh, yeah. Yeah, right.

24:36.467 --> 24:39.868
Uh, yeah, I guess I better get going.

24:41.220 --> 24:42.686
You don't seem so sure.

24:42.711 --> 24:44.882
Yeah, I am. It's a great opportunity.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.600
Now you sound like you're
trying to convince yourself.

24:46.702 --> 24:48.730
What do you care? I
already helped you, okay?

24:48.751 --> 24:50.460
- We're done.
- We are.

24:50.575 --> 24:52.406
But, as I said,

24:52.441 --> 24:55.434
Henry Mills was my favorite
character in the book.

24:55.576 --> 24:57.542
He always knew the right path.

24:57.567 --> 24:59.940
And I'd just hate to think
his namesake would choose

24:59.977 --> 25:01.610
the wrong path.

25:04.278 --> 25:05.932
Enjoy New York.

25:21.542 --> 25:22.959
- Mmm.
- Hmm?

25:26.975 --> 25:28.408
Ah.

25:28.786 --> 25:30.245
Well, it's your lucky day

25:30.270 --> 25:32.078
because this is our last free sample,

25:32.181 --> 25:35.122
and I always save the best for... oh.

25:35.223 --> 25:36.589
Last.

25:36.614 --> 25:38.685
Well, hi.

25:39.137 --> 25:40.003
It's you.

25:40.028 --> 25:42.396
Hey. Yeah. Tilly, right?

25:42.497 --> 25:43.957
Good memory.

25:44.059 --> 25:45.392
You remembered me?

25:45.461 --> 25:46.982
Well, I saved your life the other day.

25:47.036 --> 25:48.363
Kind of makes you hard to forget.

25:48.388 --> 25:49.362
Good.

25:49.465 --> 25:53.495
I mean, uh, good that you
saved my life, obviously.

25:55.413 --> 25:56.995
I don't think I got your name.

25:57.096 --> 25:59.041
Margot with a "t."

25:59.487 --> 26:00.602
"Targot"?

26:00.698 --> 26:01.712
Other end.

26:01.884 --> 26:03.251
Got it.

26:03.276 --> 26:06.398
Well, thanks for saving my life,

26:06.445 --> 26:09.749
and, uh, for giving me
some excellent advice.

26:10.484 --> 26:13.153
You stayed in town. I'm glad.

26:13.617 --> 26:16.790
Yeah. I pulled things together.

26:17.042 --> 26:18.793
I was just in a bad place when we met.

26:19.630 --> 26:23.460
Well, that's funny because
now I am in one of those.

26:24.111 --> 26:25.514
Well...

26:25.702 --> 26:27.334
you came to the right bench

26:27.731 --> 26:29.130
because that there's called a beignet.

26:29.375 --> 26:33.126
And nobody can feel bad while
they're eating it, so eat.

26:33.428 --> 26:35.553
And if you want, talk.

26:37.084 --> 26:40.506
Well, it's just my mom said
she wanted me back in town,

26:40.561 --> 26:43.902
and then she's been, like,
impossible to be around,

26:43.927 --> 26:45.894
and she's totally
keeping things from me.

26:46.130 --> 26:48.255
I'm sorry. I feel bad for you.

26:48.357 --> 26:49.389
Thanks.

26:49.491 --> 26:50.757
And I feel bad for her, too.

26:50.826 --> 26:51.825
Why?

26:51.927 --> 26:53.593
She's the one keeping secrets from me.

26:53.629 --> 26:56.391
Yeah, well, I can't imagine
having someone like you around

26:56.416 --> 27:00.112
and feeling like I couldn't tell
you the truth for some reason.

27:00.167 --> 27:03.236
And I'll bet it hurts her
more than it hurts you.

27:03.338 --> 27:04.571
Just a guess.

27:05.144 --> 27:06.483
Might be a good guess.

27:06.508 --> 27:09.611
You know, you're pretty
astute for an almost runaway.

27:09.775 --> 27:11.845
This rocks, by the way.

27:12.361 --> 27:14.114
Best one we made all day.

27:14.622 --> 27:16.555
It's heart-shaped.

27:16.689 --> 27:18.843
Oh, yeah! Like a real heart.

27:18.876 --> 27:20.585
That's cool. You did this?

27:20.696 --> 27:21.764
Yeah.

27:21.789 --> 27:23.116
It was an accident,

27:23.141 --> 27:25.899
but I think maybe it
was a happy accident.

27:25.985 --> 27:27.337
Yeah.

27:27.542 --> 27:28.959
I think that it was.

28:20.161 --> 28:22.244
Ugh. You've got to be kidding me.

28:45.490 --> 28:46.823
That whirlpool!

28:46.925 --> 28:48.859
Every time I think
I've steered us clear...

28:48.961 --> 28:50.060
It's following us!

28:50.128 --> 28:52.128
The old girl can't hold out much longer!

28:52.231 --> 28:53.964
Do something!

28:56.417 --> 28:58.251
I think this is the end, lad.

28:58.303 --> 29:00.103
I can't tell you enough how sorry I am

29:00.205 --> 29:02.339
to have brought you to this.

29:02.407 --> 29:05.876
You were just trying to get
me what I thought I wanted.

29:05.944 --> 29:07.777
I've been so stupid.

29:14.250 --> 29:15.667
Give me that ring!

29:20.259 --> 29:22.259
A whirlpool that
follows you isn't normal.

29:22.327 --> 29:24.060
It's magic!

29:24.129 --> 29:26.496
And I've got a feeling
that a certain pirate king

29:26.598 --> 29:28.198
wants his ring back.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.400
Hook, take us toward that whirlpool.

29:30.502 --> 29:33.069
Wait, wait, wait. Toward the whirlpool?

29:33.105 --> 29:34.304
You'll kill us all!

29:34.373 --> 29:35.872
If you are taking a risk

29:35.941 --> 29:37.774
for the sake of impressing Cinderella...

29:37.809 --> 29:40.610
I'm not because it's suddenly
become very clear to me

29:40.667 --> 29:41.917
that the only thing that she would want

29:41.959 --> 29:43.168
is for me to get home alive.

29:43.282 --> 29:44.881
Take us toward the whirlpool!

29:45.754 --> 29:46.750
I trust any Hook

29:46.834 --> 29:49.126
to safely pilot any vessel in any realm.

29:57.501 --> 29:59.043
No!

29:59.798 --> 30:01.331
No!

30:37.083 --> 30:40.834
Keep us steady! As close as you can!

30:42.274 --> 30:43.640
Aah!

30:43.742 --> 30:45.675
You've got it, sir!

30:46.097 --> 30:47.830
Throw it, lad!

31:34.250 --> 31:35.375
- Yes!
- Whoo!

31:43.918 --> 31:45.960
- You did it, lad.
- We did it.

31:48.430 --> 31:50.273
That's the story your
family are gonna be telling

31:50.375 --> 31:51.608
about Henry Mills.

31:51.676 --> 31:54.044
I told you. I don't want that anymore.

31:54.146 --> 31:55.645
I don't need a great story.

31:55.747 --> 31:58.214
I just want a great life,

31:58.283 --> 32:00.850
the best life I can make
with the people I love.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.953
And I have to hope that
that's gonna be enough,

32:04.056 --> 32:05.327
even for Cinderella.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.670
Hey, Henry.

32:20.792 --> 32:22.251
- You okay?
- Hey.

32:22.340 --> 32:23.807
Yeah, it's just a flat tire.

32:23.875 --> 32:25.175
It's like yours last night.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.543
It's an epidemic.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.745
The universe does not want me
to get on this flight today.

32:28.770 --> 32:29.681
That's right.

32:29.706 --> 32:31.714
You have that job
interview in New York, huh?

32:31.817 --> 32:33.183
Forget your car. Get in.

32:33.250 --> 32:35.001
I'll drive you to the airport.

32:36.221 --> 32:37.320
Come on.

32:37.422 --> 32:38.780
What are you waiting for?

32:39.700 --> 32:41.279
Actually...

32:42.045 --> 32:43.693
I don't think I'm getting
on that flight tonight, Nick.

32:43.795 --> 32:44.983
Why?

32:45.000 --> 32:45.938
I know it sounds crazy,

32:45.959 --> 32:48.084
but you want to know what
I found in my flat tire?

32:48.900 --> 32:50.306
This.

32:51.103 --> 32:52.915
It looks like part of
a glass slipper, right?

32:52.962 --> 32:54.637
If that's not a sign,
I don't know what is.

32:54.801 --> 32:56.835
Starting to believe
your own fairy tales?

32:58.210 --> 32:59.909
Maybe...

33:00.011 --> 33:01.576
I'm starting to believe in myself.

33:01.601 --> 33:03.313
So, if you're still offering that ride,

33:03.415 --> 33:05.548
I need to go see Jacinda,

33:05.650 --> 33:06.898
tell her how I feel.

33:09.221 --> 33:11.087
Great. Hop in.

33:11.209 --> 33:13.127
Let's go get you everything you deserve.

33:29.042 --> 33:30.292
Surprise.

33:31.584 --> 33:33.126
Where is this?

33:33.256 --> 33:35.881
It's a very pretty lake.

33:36.197 --> 33:38.598
I thought you were taking
me somewhere famous.

33:38.700 --> 33:40.533
Was there a battle around here?

33:40.602 --> 33:41.668
Nope.

33:41.693 --> 33:43.669
And no one famous ever died here

33:43.771 --> 33:45.404
or cast a curse.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.972
This may be the one place
in the entire magical kingdom

33:48.027 --> 33:51.010
where nothing epic ever happened.

33:51.455 --> 33:53.572
Well, it's gorgeous,

33:53.627 --> 33:55.348
and it doesn't need anything else.

33:55.450 --> 33:56.736
Ella.

33:59.888 --> 34:02.288
I don't know how my story goes.

34:02.667 --> 34:04.418
I wasn't born in a land with magic,

34:04.501 --> 34:07.626
and I may not get a fairy-tale
life with a perfect ending,

34:07.763 --> 34:10.362
but you are the best

34:10.465 --> 34:14.000
and bravest woman that I have ever met.

34:14.820 --> 34:17.549
And if you could make
a leap of faith with me,

34:17.885 --> 34:22.507
I'd like to build a house
right here for the two of us.

34:23.049 --> 34:25.940
And we could see what kind
of life we can make together.

34:33.165 --> 34:34.630
It's just a pretty ring.

34:34.949 --> 34:36.014
Like me and this lake,

34:36.039 --> 34:38.724
it doesn't come with anything else.

34:39.000 --> 34:43.896
Ella, I can't offer you a legend,

34:43.998 --> 34:46.032
but I can offer you my heart.

34:47.226 --> 34:48.648
Can I say yes now?

34:48.672 --> 34:50.000
I really wish you would.

34:50.125 --> 34:51.958
Yes.

35:03.417 --> 35:04.667
I thought that was Tilly's job.

35:04.752 --> 35:07.220
Yeah, well, it turns out our
girl was born to do sales.

35:07.322 --> 35:08.621
Thanks, Tilly.

35:08.667 --> 35:10.667
She had the brilliant idea
of handing out samples,

35:10.745 --> 35:12.545
and the customers love her.

35:13.550 --> 35:15.161
They all know my name now.

35:15.447 --> 35:16.898
I think it's because I'm talking to them

35:16.945 --> 35:19.687
instead of stealing anything
without anyone seeing me.

35:19.750 --> 35:22.301
Yeah, well, that's a
good working theory.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.804
I'm glad you've had a good first day.

35:26.445 --> 35:27.874
Thank you, Sabine.

35:28.140 --> 35:29.382
Yeah, thanks, Sabine.

35:29.586 --> 35:31.477
Come on, then.

35:31.579 --> 35:33.930
She's gonna pay me to
do something I like.

35:34.047 --> 35:36.849
I didn't think it was possible.

35:36.884 --> 35:38.618
And I met someone really special.

35:38.720 --> 35:39.802
Oh, yeah? Who's that?

35:39.841 --> 35:40.951
She's called Margot

35:41.021 --> 35:43.723
with a "t" at the end, not the front.

35:44.029 --> 35:46.726
It was like she really saw me, you know?

35:46.828 --> 35:48.728
Saw me for who I really am.

35:52.417 --> 35:53.500
If you were trying to catch that flight,

35:53.635 --> 35:54.600
you were cutting it close.

35:54.669 --> 35:56.469
Oh, yeah. So, I was running late

35:56.571 --> 35:58.204
because I was talking to the detectives.

35:58.273 --> 36:00.473
Turns out that the cult-killer guy

36:00.575 --> 36:01.841
had a copy of my book.

36:02.334 --> 36:04.417
- Really?
- Yeah.

36:04.438 --> 36:05.511
Huh.

36:06.274 --> 36:09.749
So, uh, lawyer to storyteller,

36:09.817 --> 36:12.118
you guys have a theory
on the... on the case?

36:12.220 --> 36:13.452
Yeah, sort of.

36:13.521 --> 36:15.621
Um, cult members killed his sister,

36:15.690 --> 36:17.857
so he's out for revenge, using my book

36:17.925 --> 36:20.359
to make it some kind of,
like, righteous inquisition.

36:20.459 --> 36:22.335
- Huh.
- Oh, hey. Get this.

36:22.397 --> 36:23.716
I'm pretty sure that this guy thinks

36:23.751 --> 36:26.335
that he's Hansel from the fairy tale.

36:26.583 --> 36:30.236
So, how do you do a Hansel hunt?

36:30.338 --> 36:32.905
You stake out the lederhosen stores?

36:32.974 --> 36:37.143
Dust for gingerbread?
Look for breadcrumbs.

36:54.125 --> 36:55.876
Hey, there's a Hilton up here.

36:55.997 --> 36:56.896
They have an airport shuttle.

36:56.998 --> 36:58.490
I could probably still make my flight.

36:58.576 --> 37:00.358
Thought you wanted to go see Jacinda.

37:00.444 --> 37:02.535
Yeah, I changed my mind.

37:03.144 --> 37:04.180
You know what?

37:04.205 --> 37:06.572
I'll just get out up here.

37:19.459 --> 37:22.168
I don't think we're gonna
make it to the airport tonight.

37:36.709 --> 37:38.376
Okay. Okay.

37:38.473 --> 37:40.072
All right.

37:52.125 --> 37:53.500
Hey, Mom!

37:55.188 --> 37:57.844
Well, look at you. That's a happy girl.

37:57.876 --> 37:59.668
- You had a good time with Kelly?
- Yeah.

37:59.728 --> 38:02.072
We spent most of the time
organizing the supply,

38:02.127 --> 38:03.596
so it's fun.

38:03.698 --> 38:04.869
But...

38:06.434 --> 38:09.199
the real happy is because
I have a good feeling

38:09.224 --> 38:10.641
about you and Henry.

38:10.666 --> 38:11.868
Lucy, last time he was here,

38:11.893 --> 38:13.506
you practically threw him out the door.

38:13.611 --> 38:17.330
Yeah, um, I've been thinking about that,

38:17.393 --> 38:19.712
and I guess I just got scared

38:19.814 --> 38:22.093
when it started getting real, you know?

38:22.773 --> 38:25.859
Everything was changing, but, you know,

38:25.916 --> 38:29.484
this is what I've always
wanted... you guys together.

38:31.171 --> 38:32.866
You were about to call him.

38:33.210 --> 38:34.126
Oh, go ahead.

38:34.228 --> 38:35.895
You won't even know I'm here.

38:35.997 --> 38:39.765
Honey, um, Henry's headed out of town.

38:39.834 --> 38:41.600
He's got a chance at a job in New York.

38:41.702 --> 38:42.645
No, no, no.

38:42.670 --> 38:45.261
Call him and tell him
he doesn't have to go.

38:45.292 --> 38:48.210
Look, this is my fault because
I got weird on you guys.

38:48.544 --> 38:50.560
If you don't get together...

38:51.694 --> 38:54.106
I'm gonna feel guilty
for the rest of my life.

38:57.834 --> 38:59.418
You know you want to.

39:16.242 --> 39:17.570
Nick.

39:19.377 --> 39:20.376
Nick.

39:27.152 --> 39:28.184
Hansel?

39:29.550 --> 39:32.084
Hmm. It really is a pretty sound.

39:32.459 --> 39:34.960
I haven't heard my real
name in a very long time.

39:35.725 --> 39:36.726
Chocolate?

39:36.751 --> 39:39.627
Wha... hey, what...

39:41.144 --> 39:42.477
What are you gonna do to me?

39:42.510 --> 39:43.829
Undetermined.

39:43.931 --> 39:46.198
Well, hey, it's not too
late to turn yourself in.

39:46.267 --> 39:49.198
Just, uh... we'll just
tell him you're Hansel.

39:49.209 --> 39:51.584
They'll think you're crazy, but
that could be a good thing...

39:51.901 --> 39:53.367
for you.

39:53.572 --> 39:55.172
Yeah.

39:56.826 --> 39:58.788
There's just one problem.

39:58.813 --> 40:01.480
In that scenario, I
don't get to keep killing.

40:02.765 --> 40:05.017
And I'm not done killing.

40:22.470 --> 40:23.685
Margot?

40:23.825 --> 40:25.204
Hi.

40:27.918 --> 40:30.419
Look, I'm sorry about
what happened earlier.

40:31.050 --> 40:33.191
Sounds like you've
had a change of heart.

40:33.285 --> 40:35.441
Yeah, well, somebody
helped me see things

40:35.511 --> 40:37.316
a little bit differently.

40:38.082 --> 40:39.685
Whatever reason, you feel
like you can't tell me

40:39.754 --> 40:41.587
what's going on right now,

40:42.117 --> 40:44.150
and, well, that can't
be fun for you, either.

40:44.524 --> 40:46.095
I don't know what's going on with you,

40:46.126 --> 40:49.028
but I didn't mean to make things worse.

40:53.034 --> 40:55.701
I'm really sorry I can't
tell you everything,

40:55.803 --> 40:57.287
but it will change soon.

40:57.326 --> 40:58.647
I hope so.

40:58.873 --> 41:01.050
I don't like feeling like
you're in some kind of trouble.

41:01.075 --> 41:04.037
No, it's... it's not me. I'm fine.

41:04.154 --> 41:07.646
I was thinking about some
of what you said earlier,

41:07.748 --> 41:09.148
and you were right about Chad.

41:09.250 --> 41:13.185
I-I miss him terribly,

41:13.405 --> 41:15.921
and I wish I could make that right.

41:15.990 --> 41:18.967
Actually, I have some
news on that front.

41:19.194 --> 41:23.128
These were outside with your name on it.

41:23.230 --> 41:24.418
Heart-shaped box...

41:24.449 --> 41:26.599
At least what people call heart-shaped.

41:26.709 --> 41:29.084
Must be from your man.
