Hey, you guys ever check Zillow?

00:36.904 --> 00:38.539
Joe, why don't you shut the...

00:38.572 --> 00:41.075
Tell me more
about this silly word.

00:41.109 --> 00:43.077
It's this website, Zillow.com.

00:43.111 --> 00:45.279
You plug in your address,
and it gives you an estimate

00:45.313 --> 00:46.614
of what your house is worth.

00:46.647 --> 00:48.082
But they call it a Zestimate,

00:48.116 --> 00:49.750
because of the "Z" in "Zillow."

00:49.783 --> 00:51.419
(laughs)

00:51.452 --> 00:53.020
How do they...

00:53.053 --> 00:56.056
I just don't have
that creative bone.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.459
Wow, my house is way up
from when I bought it.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.461
-Mine's up, too.
-What the hell?

01:00.494 --> 01:03.364
Mine's way below
what you guys's are worth.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.199
Wait, this-this can't be right.

01:05.233 --> 01:08.269
It says... it says
my house is a murder house.

01:08.302 --> 01:10.871
What, like-like someone
was killed there?

01:10.904 --> 01:13.141
Yeah, it says...
it says, in the '60s,

01:13.174 --> 01:16.144
some woman named Doris
Billingsly died in my house.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.478
Probably some naggy bitch,
right?

01:17.511 --> 01:19.147
-Joseph!
-You know, they say

01:19.180 --> 01:21.315
when someone dies violently
like that,

01:21.349 --> 01:23.651
-their spirit can linger.
-What do you mean?

01:23.684 --> 01:26.320
I'm saying you might have
a g-g-g-g-g...

01:26.354 --> 01:28.789
disembodied spirit
in your house!

01:28.822 --> 01:30.124
Wow, this is so cool.

01:30.158 --> 01:32.493
Have you ever witnessed
anything strange there?

01:32.526 --> 01:34.762
Actually,
now that you mention it...

01:35.796 --> 01:36.764
Good news!

01:36.797 --> 01:38.466

What's up?

01:56.384 --> 01:58.152
Not much.
I wanted to know

01:58.186 --> 02:00.020
if you're gonna go
to the dance on Friday.

02:00.053 --> 02:01.955
Nah, probably not.

02:01.989 --> 02:03.424
Oh, that's too bad.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.627
I was thinking maybe
you and I could go together.

that very attractive girl

02:20.308 --> 02:22.276
just asked you out,
and you said no.

02:22.310 --> 02:25.279
Well, sorry, Brian,
she just doesn't do it for me.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.280
I'm hungry.

02:26.314 --> 02:28.282
I might grab a bite to eat.

We all just ate, right?

02:29.850 --> 02:31.319
What's wrong with that kid?

Why wouldn't he go out
with that girl?

Who knows? Maybe he's gay.

02:33.887 --> 02:35.022
What? No.

Well, you never know.
I say we find out.

Hey, I've been right
about these things before.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.663
Remember what I said in 2009?

02:42.696 --> 02:44.532
-Bruce Jenner is a man.
-No, Brian.

02:44.565 --> 02:47.067
That's what the press would
have you believe, but he's not.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.669
Bruce Jenner is a woman.

02:48.702 --> 02:52.740
An elegant,
beautiful Dutch woman.

02:52.773 --> 02:55.676
(thunder crashing)

03:00.113 --> 03:03.751
Okay, guys, now, the murder took
place down here in the basement,

03:03.784 --> 03:07.054
so it's probably our best shot
at finding something.

03:07.087 --> 03:09.323
I do feel a presence in the air.

Only Lucifer would reveal
himself to you, adulterer.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.596
Well, now, I have
to warn you fellas--

03:15.629 --> 03:19.433
the only spirits I'm used to
chasing are whiskey and tequila.

03:31.545 --> 03:32.846
Trying something new for Joe.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.782
And we're looking for ghosts.

03:34.815 --> 03:37.351
We're like the male version
of the female Ghostbusters.

03:37.385 --> 03:39.787
Peter, there's no such thing
as ghosts.

Just follow my lead.

03:54.502 --> 03:56.236

to communicate with us?

What the hell was that?

04:03.977 --> 04:06.647
I got scared and tried to run
through the wall,

04:06.680 --> 04:08.549
leaving a hole shaped like me.

04:08.582 --> 04:11.018
Yeah, can't do that
in a basement, bud.

04:14.021 --> 04:16.824
All right, fellas, I just
finished up an EVP session.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.659
Let's see
if we picked anything up.

04:18.692 --> 04:19.660
What's EVP?

04:19.693 --> 04:21.395
Electronic voice phenomenon.

04:21.429 --> 04:24.064
Oftentimes, the human ear
can't pick up paranormal sounds,

04:24.097 --> 04:26.266
but electronic
recording devices can.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.369
Mm. That right?

Yeah.

Dad, they did this bit
in the lady Ghostbusters.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.394

Stewie, I'm telling you,
there's no way Chris is gay.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.669
Oh, why,
because he never hit on you?

Just relaxing, listening to some
of Charles Manson's music.

05:09.577 --> 05:11.044
What's up with you guys?

05:11.078 --> 05:13.381
Actually, Brian and I
are taking a survey,

05:13.414 --> 05:15.483

to pay for jeans.

05:26.927 --> 05:29.262
Um, five dollars?

05:30.864 --> 05:32.500
What year
did Bette Midler release

05:32.533 --> 05:34.034
"You've Got to Have Friends"?

05:34.067 --> 05:36.169
Oh, 1972.

05:36.203 --> 05:39.840
And it was fabulous!

05:44.612 --> 05:45.713

05:45.746 --> 05:47.981
What? No, I'm not gay.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.050
Well, then why didn't you go out
with that girl?

05:50.083 --> 05:51.585
(chuckles)
Why would I?

05:51.619 --> 05:55.423
I have everything I need in
that department on my computer.

05:55.456 --> 05:59.393

playing simultaneously?

05:59.427 --> 06:02.730
Sometimes I pretend I'm
at the security desk at the mall

06:02.763 --> 06:05.733
and everyone at the mall
is banging each other.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.200
Chris, don't you see?

06:07.234 --> 06:09.437
You're so desensitized
by all this porn,

06:09.470 --> 06:11.605
you're-you're not
even interested in actual girls.

06:11.639 --> 06:13.273

getting off sugar.

What? Oh, no, I'm-I'm not a...

09:23.731 --> 09:25.565
Morning, Doctor.

09:25.599 --> 09:27.567
Wow, Peter,
they all think you're a doctor

09:27.601 --> 09:29.136
because of your white hair.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.905
I have to say, it does make you
look more distinguished.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.774
Really? Huh.

09:33.807 --> 09:36.109
Well, maybe this will be
a good thing after all.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.577
Like a garbageman with no nose.

09:39.446 --> 09:42.082
Well, this is the best job
in the world!

09:42.115 --> 09:43.483
Rotting meat?

09:43.516 --> 09:45.218
What does that smell like?

09:45.252 --> 09:46.820
Oh, look, receipts.

09:46.854 --> 09:49.156
I'll steal
this person's identity.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.892
From now on,
I'm Robert Dibadeaux.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.061
So long, stinkies!

09:54.094 --> 09:56.764
Not that I would know.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.635
All right, Chris,
it's gonna take a few steps

10:01.669 --> 10:03.103
to get you off hard-core porn.

10:03.136 --> 10:05.005
Now, the first step
is soft-core porn,

10:05.038 --> 10:06.473
where nothing really happens.

10:06.506 --> 10:07.841
(TV clicks on)

10:07.875 --> 10:11.411
Oh, wow, she is just riding
that guy's belly button.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.413
Yep, that's all we had.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.283
And you could watch this
at any time?

10:16.316 --> 10:18.919
No, just Friday at 11:45 p.m.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.353
And it was free?

10:20.387 --> 10:22.089
No, $45 a month.

10:22.122 --> 10:25.025
Well, what was playing
the other 200 hours per week?

10:25.058 --> 10:27.695
Uh, mostly D.A.R.Y.L.
The movie D.A.R.Y.L.

10:27.728 --> 10:28.929
Was it any good?

10:28.962 --> 10:30.430
It was okay.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.933
Grandpa,
what are you doing here?

10:32.966 --> 10:34.768
Using the bathroom.
Where do you keep the nets

10:34.802 --> 10:36.636
that you put on the bottom
of guys' balls

10:36.670 --> 10:38.471
to stop 'em
from dunking in the water?

10:38.505 --> 10:39.940
-What?
-What do you mean, "What?"

10:39.973 --> 10:42.609
(rhythmically):
Where do you keep the nets

10:42.642 --> 10:46.613
that you put on the bottom
of guys' balls

10:46.646 --> 10:50.751
to stop them
from dunking in the water?

10:54.321 --> 10:56.456
Oh, there's my silver fox.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.491
What are you doing out here?

10:58.525 --> 10:59.960
Well, now that I've got
white hair,

10:59.993 --> 11:01.795
I fix my car in slow motion

11:01.829 --> 11:04.497
in an ad for a supplemental
blood thinner.

11:04.531 --> 11:06.299
-(soft piano music playing)
-I took Zanbrex

11:06.333 --> 11:07.801
for over 15 years,

11:07.835 --> 11:10.704
till I learned the benefits
of once-daily Sanguelto,

11:10.738 --> 11:12.906
a latest-generation
blood thinner.

11:12.940 --> 11:15.843
When I'm at a multiracial
picnic for some reason,

11:15.876 --> 11:18.311
the last thing I want to do
is have a stroke.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.513
And thanks
to once-daily Sanguelto,

11:20.547 --> 11:23.583
I can eat potato salad
with chuckling strangers

11:23.616 --> 11:25.518
with the confidence
of someone who knows

11:25.552 --> 11:28.756
he's 12% less likely
to suffer a stroke recurrence.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.924
Thanks to Sanguelto,
I can snuggle

11:30.958 --> 11:33.493
with my age-appropriate wife
on a blanket

11:33.526 --> 11:35.829
underneath
non-holiday-related fireworks.

11:35.863 --> 11:38.398
I left her for six weeks
back in 2009,

11:38.431 --> 11:40.500
only to realize
I was already too old

11:40.533 --> 11:42.169
to bed the type of women

11:42.202 --> 11:44.271
that would make
such a separation worth it.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.339
So, here we are,
grinding it out

11:46.373 --> 11:48.108
till one of us has
that second stroke

11:48.141 --> 11:49.843
that you don't come back from.

11:49.877 --> 11:52.212
Thank you, Sanguelto.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.017
What's all this?

11:57.050 --> 11:59.219
Well, a lot of kids'
first foray into sex

11:59.252 --> 12:01.354
is looking
at someone else's porn stash.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.590
So, here's a stack
of water-stained Playboys

12:03.623 --> 12:06.193
that I found in a locker
at the town pool bathroom.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.762
Okay, now we're talking.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.532
(whooshing)

12:12.565 --> 12:14.601
Wait. I'm clicking
on this thumbnail,

12:14.634 --> 12:16.469
but the video isn't opening.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.071
No, that's a still image.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.372
See, you look at them,

12:19.406 --> 12:22.042
and then your brain sort of
creates a scene for you.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.812
I don't know. I think maybe
we should try something else.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.713
I think
you should give it a shot.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.049
I think we should all
go investigate

12:29.082 --> 12:32.285
the still-unsolved murder
of Doris Billingsly,

12:32.319 --> 12:35.555
who never did anything
but overcook one dinner

12:35.588 --> 12:39.092
in March of 1962.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.365
All right, I got next round.

12:48.468 --> 12:49.837
Hey, Tom, you okay?

12:49.870 --> 12:51.238
She left me.

12:51.271 --> 12:54.174
Another sign from the universe
that I'll never find love.

12:54.207 --> 12:57.277
Hey, come on, pal. There's
plenty of fish in the sea.

13:01.815 --> 13:03.616
Wow.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.919
You're right. There are.

13:05.953 --> 13:08.788
Say, you've got a way about you,

13:08.822 --> 13:11.758
a certain...
trustworthy quality.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.026
You know, we've got an opening

13:13.060 --> 13:14.594
at the station
for a senior analyst.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.197
I think your white hair
would be perfect for it.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.866
Wow. Really? What do I do?

13:18.899 --> 13:21.935
You just act like everyone else
is an idiot and shout over them.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.837
-That way, you can...
-Shut up! I get it!

13:23.871 --> 13:25.438
Terrific.
Hey, why don't you come down

13:25.472 --> 13:26.606
to the station tomorrow and...?

13:26.639 --> 13:28.976
-I know where you work!
-Again, terrific.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.611
Wow, this is awesome.

13:31.644 --> 13:35.115
I haven't been on TV since
I had IBS on The Bachelorette.

13:35.148 --> 13:38.285
Derek,
I had such a magical weekend.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.320
You are truly one of a kind.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.788
(loud stomach grumbling)

13:41.821 --> 13:43.323
And that's why
I've decided to...

13:43.356 --> 13:46.126
Excuse me. Uh, do-do you know
if I'm gonna get a rose?

13:46.159 --> 13:47.827
We're getting to that, Peter.

13:47.861 --> 13:51.164
Derek, that's why I've decided
to give you this rose.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.732
(stomach grumbling
and squealing)

13:52.765 --> 13:55.335
Evan, getting to see
your softer side was truly...

13:55.368 --> 13:56.536
-(stomach growling)
-Excuse me.

13:56.569 --> 13:58.405
I hate to be a bother,
but do you...

13:58.438 --> 14:00.307
do you know
if I'll be receiving a rose?

14:00.340 --> 14:01.741
Because if there's, uh,
further delay,

14:01.774 --> 14:03.210
I believe
something's gonna happen

14:03.243 --> 14:05.545
that will put me
out of contention for a rose.

14:05.578 --> 14:06.980
(stomach gurgles loudly)

14:07.014 --> 14:08.381
And that thing just happened.

14:08.415 --> 14:09.682
Farewell, and thank you

14:09.716 --> 14:11.919
for feeding me champagne
and shrimp all day.

14:16.723 --> 14:18.325
Reporting live
from Quahog Prison,

14:18.358 --> 14:20.360
I'm Joe Horrigan,
Channel Five News.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.662
Thanks, Joe.
Great reporting, terrible eyes.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.431
Switching gears now,
I'd like to talk

14:24.464 --> 14:26.533
about the crime situation
here in Quahog.

14:26.566 --> 14:29.669
Joining me now is white-haired
contributor Peter Griffin.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.439
Peter, what are you hearing
about crime in Quahog?

14:32.472 --> 14:35.208
Uh... you know, not much.

14:35.242 --> 14:37.877
Not much?
Excuse us for one moment.

14:39.579 --> 14:40.747
-What are you doing?!
-What?

14:40.780 --> 14:42.182
I don't know anything
about crime.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.851
So? People want to know that
bad stuff's going on out there.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.253
That's why they watch the news.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.421
-You want me to make stuff up?
-I don't know.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.390
I thought you had white hair.

14:50.423 --> 14:53.593
-You're right, I do.
-Of course you do.

14:53.626 --> 14:56.196
(gasps, giggles)

14:56.229 --> 14:58.198
Now, you were talking
about crime?

14:58.231 --> 15:00.200
Crime is way up,
and you know why?

15:00.233 --> 15:01.601
'Cause of immigrants.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.103
I say, as Americans,

15:03.136 --> 15:05.538
we should all take a pledge
to kick 'em out.

15:05.572 --> 15:08.976
Only pledge I stand for
is Lemon Pledge.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.613
(squeaking)

15:15.515 --> 15:18.618
Peter Griffin, white hair, very
credible, thank you so much.

15:18.651 --> 15:21.254
Coming up,
lost dog comes home...

15:21.288 --> 15:23.456
one piece at a time.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.325
(news theme music plays)

15:27.927 --> 15:29.729
Peter, that was amazing.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.598
I'm the news director
here at Channel Five.

15:31.631 --> 15:34.167
How would you like to do
what you just did every night?

15:34.201 --> 15:35.768
Wipe a bloody booger
under the desk?

15:35.802 --> 15:37.770
No, I'm asking you
to join us full-time

15:37.804 --> 15:39.806
to be our permanent
senior analyst.

15:39.839 --> 15:42.142
Would you excuse me
while I step into another room

15:42.175 --> 15:45.478
and celebrate like a girl in a
rom-com who just got good news?

15:48.115 --> 15:50.417
Aah! The Sanguelto!

15:50.450 --> 15:52.619
My blood's thinner than water!

15:54.187 --> 15:56.156
-(soft piano music playing)
-If taking Sanguelto,

15:56.189 --> 15:58.425
please refrain
from dancing like in a rom-com,

15:58.458 --> 16:00.493
as nosebleeds may be permanent.

16:00.527 --> 16:03.263
And remember, most drugs
are prescribed to you

16:03.296 --> 16:05.365
because a hot girl
with a rolling suitcase

16:05.398 --> 16:07.400
gave your doctor a free pen.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.610
Peter, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

16:17.644 --> 16:20.613
Who says you can just make
things up and call them facts?

16:20.647 --> 16:22.449
Tom Tucker did.
He kissed me.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.984
You have a responsibility
as a member of the press

16:25.018 --> 16:27.187
to report the news accurately.

16:27.220 --> 16:30.623
You can't just say crazy things
that aren't in any way true.

16:30.657 --> 16:34.194
JOE (laughing): Yeah, leave that
to the yahoos in D.C.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.497
-Did that get a "That's So Joe"?
-No!

16:37.530 --> 16:39.299
Okay, well,
what are the rules on that?

16:39.332 --> 16:40.967
We're still working that out.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.236
Well, let me know
when you decide on the rules.

16:43.270 --> 16:46.039
I'm really excited
about working on this.

16:46.073 --> 16:48.108
With you guys.

16:52.179 --> 16:54.747
Chris, welcome
to the lingerie department.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.316
What are we doing here?

16:56.349 --> 16:58.818
When I was young, seeing
these half-naked mannequins

16:58.851 --> 17:00.653
was all I needed
to get me going.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.089
What's the endgame here--

17:02.122 --> 17:03.990
him walking around Macy's
with a chub?

17:04.023 --> 17:06.193
No, we've got
to reset his arousal meter.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.661
He needs to be able
to use his imagination again.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.863
Any of these mannequins
doing anything for you, Chris?

17:10.897 --> 17:12.865
Uh, I don't know.

17:12.899 --> 17:15.435
I guess the one
without a head is pretty cool.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.670
All right, that's...
that's something.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.940
And that bin of chopped-up ones
over there-- that could be okay.

17:20.973 --> 17:24.043
'Specially the one
that looks kind of afraid.

17:24.077 --> 17:26.045
There you go. Look at you.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.181
Sounds like someone is ready
for that date.

17:28.215 --> 17:29.682
Do you gentlemen need any help?

17:29.716 --> 17:30.917
No, thank you, dear.

17:30.950 --> 17:33.620
We're just trying
to get my brother to full mast.

17:36.656 --> 17:39.559
We want to welcome back our new
permanent senior analyst,

17:39.592 --> 17:41.561
Peter Griffin
and his white hair.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.396
What's the latest
on crime in Quahog?

17:43.430 --> 17:45.865
-Tom, crime is up.
-Wow. How high?

17:45.898 --> 17:48.201
-All the way to the top.
-Whoa. The top.

17:48.235 --> 17:50.870
Has it ever been all the way
to the top before, Peter?

17:50.903 --> 17:53.072
Never. In fact,
we had to raise the top.

17:53.106 --> 17:55.742
So, the new top is even higher
than the old top?

17:55.775 --> 17:57.644
Yes, the old top
is now the middle.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.212
And The Midd is a show

17:59.246 --> 18:01.914
that was inexplicably on ABC
for a very long time.

18:01.948 --> 18:03.383
How many seasons?

18:03.416 --> 18:05.585
It might be, like, 11.
I'm not even kidding.

18:05.618 --> 18:08.321
Peter Griffin, white hair, very
credible, thank you so much.

18:08.355 --> 18:10.390
Coming up,
we'll tell you where to look

18:10.423 --> 18:13.426
when a person has a birthmark
on their face.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.966
So, Chris, have you weaned
yourself off of Internet porn?

18:19.999 --> 18:23.170
Wait. I thought the whole point
was to not wean myself off.

18:23.203 --> 18:26.072
No, Chris, I mean,
have you stopped...? Never mind.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.408
-You ready for your date?
-You bet I am!

18:28.441 --> 18:29.542
(knocking)

18:32.545 --> 18:34.113
Hi, Chris.

18:34.147 --> 18:35.282
(laughing)

18:35.315 --> 18:36.983
Hi, Kristen.

18:37.016 --> 18:39.452
Ready to see a Marvel movie,
'cause I chose?

18:39.486 --> 18:41.788
Sure. And for sure
this is a real date,

18:41.821 --> 18:43.256
and me and the popular kids

18:43.290 --> 18:45.925
aren't gonna
thrill-kill you tonight.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.761
I think
Chris is gonna be just fine.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.497
(high-pitched beeping)

18:51.798 --> 18:54.367
Which is more than I can say
for our pizza.

18:54.401 --> 18:57.036
(both laughing)

18:57.069 --> 18:58.571
Oh, man.

19:06.813 --> 19:09.148
Well, I hope you're happy.

19:09.182 --> 19:12.385
You're telling lies on the news
just to boost your own ego.

19:12.419 --> 19:14.120
It's pronounced "Eggo," Lois,

19:14.153 --> 19:16.323
and I will thank you
to leggo of mine.

19:16.356 --> 19:18.124
Peter, fake news
is a real problem

19:18.157 --> 19:19.826
in this country right now,

19:19.859 --> 19:22.962
and I really don't want
my husband contributing to it.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.831
Maybe you're right.

19:24.864 --> 19:27.133
It doesn't feel good
lying all the time.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.835
I guess I just like
all the attention

19:28.868 --> 19:30.470
that came along
with having white hair.

19:30.503 --> 19:33.139
Well, I don't think that's
the kind of attention you want.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.141
And it's certainly not
the kind of attention

19:35.174 --> 19:36.809
I want for our family.

19:36.843 --> 19:39.479
You know what?
If it means that much to you,

19:39.512 --> 19:41.748
I'll tell Tom
that I won't do it anymore.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.650
-Really?
-Really.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.185
Oh, Peter,
that makes me so happy.

19:46.219 --> 19:48.688
(phone ringing)

19:48.721 --> 19:50.690
Hello? Donald Trump?!

19:50.723 --> 19:52.359
You saw me on the news?

19:52.392 --> 19:55.362
You want me to be your press
secretary in the next episode?

19:55.395 --> 19:56.996
Why, sure, I'd love to!

19:57.029 --> 19:59.165
We'll get started drawing it
right away.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.600
Lois, pack your bags.

20:00.633 --> 20:03.736
We're joining
the Trump Administration.

20:03.770 --> 20:07.274
(grunting)

20:09.576 --> 20:12.044
Just what Washington needs, huh?

20:12.078 --> 20:14.013
Another talking head.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.748
(Peter giggles)

20:15.782 --> 20:18.217
-(both laugh)
-Oh, man.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.423
ANNOUNCER:
Next week on Family Guy...

20:23.456 --> 20:26.025
Hey, Dad, I want you
to meet my new friend, Meg.

20:26.058 --> 20:29.529
Pleased to meet you, Meg.
You have a beautiful rack.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.730
Oh, thanks.

20:30.763 --> 20:33.065
I was talking to my daughter.

20:40.407 --> 20:43.376
And now, please welcome
Mr. Bruce Jenner.

20:43.410 --> 20:46.245
-(applause and cheering)
-(burlesque music plays)

20:48.348 --> 20:51.117
(cheering and whistling)

20:52.419 --> 20:54.587
(whooping)

21:00.126 --> 21:02.929
Just wanted to remind you fellas
what you're all fighting for.
