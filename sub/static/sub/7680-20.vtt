MacGYVER:
Sometimes when
they're after you,

01:30.156 --> 01:32.659
when you're
just about surrounded...

01:36.663 --> 01:40.166
you realize just how seriously
North African kids take soccer.

01:47.173 --> 01:49.175
MacGyver, you let
'em steal that ball.

01:49.676 --> 01:50.677
No way.

01:50.677 --> 01:52.679
They just play better
soccer than I do.

01:52.679 --> 01:55.181
Oh, after the way you coached
them, I don't doubt it.

01:55.682 --> 01:56.182
(organ playing)

02:01.187 --> 02:03.189
It is so wonderful
to hear music again.

02:03.189 --> 02:04.691
Thank you.

02:04.691 --> 02:06.192
Oh, you bet.

02:06.192 --> 02:08.193
It just needed a
couple of adjustment
s.

02:08.193 --> 02:10.697
That earthquake kinda
knocked it out of whack,

02:10.697 --> 02:12.198
but it's, it's
a good organ.

02:12.198 --> 02:13.199
And you are a good man,

02:13.199 --> 02:15.201
but a sneaky
soccer player.

02:17.704 --> 02:19.205
Right! It's here!

02:19.205 --> 02:21.207
Let's go!

02:21.207 --> 02:24.210
SISTER:
MacGyver,
whatisall this?

02:24.210 --> 02:25.712
It's a little surprise.

02:26.212 --> 02:28.214
But we are dee
ply grateful for a
ll the medicines

02:28.214 --> 02:29.716
you brought, but
what is this?

02:29.716 --> 02:31.217
Oh, it's a secret surprise.

02:31.217 --> 02:32.218
(laughing)
: Oh...

02:32.218 --> 02:34.220
h!
Sara

02:37.724 --> 02:39.726
u.
Here, let me help you.
Thank yo

02:39.726 --> 02:42.228
It's the cloth
ing I promised.

02:42.729 --> 02:44.230
SISTER:
Wonderful!
Oh, you are a blessing.

02:44.230 --> 02:45.732
Both of you.

02:45.732 --> 02:47.734
MacGyver, this is Sarah Ashford.

02:47.734 --> 02:49.235
o?
How do you d

02:49.235 --> 02:51.237
SISTER:
I have told her
all about you.

02:51.237 --> 02:52.238
Not everything.

02:52.238 --> 02:54.741
Well, she seems to know
more than I do.

02:54.741 --> 02:57.744
Nothing discreditabl
e, I assure you.

02:58.745 --> 02:59.746
Mac, Sarah needs

03:00.246 --> 03:01.748
a favor.

03:01.748 --> 03:03.750
Be nice to her, huh?

03:03.750 --> 03:06.252
At your orders, Sister.

03:06.753 --> 03:08.254
Thank you.

03:08.254 --> 03:11.257
Well, we can't disobey
the Mother Superior.

03:11.257 --> 03:13.760
What can I do for you,
Miss Ashford?

03:13.760 --> 03:17.263
.
I'd like you to
break my brother
out of prison here

03:20.266 --> 03:22.769
Ah...

03:22.769 --> 03:26.272
ot.
Brian is the o
nly brother I've g

03:26.272 --> 03:28.274
He's a medic
al missionary.

03:28.274 --> 03:30.777
.
All he wanted
to do was help

03:30.777 --> 03:33.780
He's in Harosh
Prison now, accused,

03:33.780 --> 03:37.283
tried... and sentenced

03:37.283 --> 03:40.286
for trying to save human lives.

03:41.287 --> 03:43.289
Well, like the man said,

03:43.790 --> 03:45.792
"No good deed goes unpunished."

03:47.794 --> 03:49.796
Sarah, what were the charges
against him?

03:49.796 --> 03:51.297
,
Well, after
the earthquake

03:51.297 --> 03:53.800
he brought in a very
valuable shipment

03:53.800 --> 03:54.801
.
of relief supplies

03:55.802 --> 03:57.303
Valuable?

03:57.303 --> 03:58.304
Worth enough money

03:58.304 --> 04:00.306
for someone
to show some interest?

04:00.306 --> 04:02.308
ly.
Yes, exact

04:02.308 --> 04:04.310
The government of th
is benighted country

04:04.310 --> 04:06.312
tried to confiscat
e the supplies,

04:06.312 --> 04:07.313
m.
so Brian hid the

04:08.815 --> 04:11.317
Well, I think it's about time
we got him out.

04:11.317 --> 04:14.320
He's in a maximum-security
military prison.

04:14.320 --> 04:17.322
Kind of makes it interesting,
doesn't it?

04:17.322 --> 04:18.324
No, no...

04:18.324 --> 04:19.325
No, no...

04:19.826 --> 04:21.327
(speaking Arabic)

04:21.327 --> 04:22.328
Madame!

04:22.829 --> 04:24.330
er?
You sure you can g
et word to your broth

04:24.330 --> 04:25.331
Visits are simple

04:25.331 --> 04:26.833
to arrange--
all one needs

04:27.333 --> 04:28.334
is enough bribe money.

04:28.835 --> 04:32.338
The only thing you can't buy
at Harosh is a man's freedom.

04:32.338 --> 04:34.340
rs,
All right, then yo
u arrange for the ca

04:34.340 --> 04:36.342
n
and as soon as I get i

04:36.342 --> 04:38.344
l.
and get the lay of
the land, I'll signa

04:38.344 --> 04:39.846
I'll be watching.

04:40.346 --> 04:43.850
You know, I'm beginning
to believe it might be possible.

04:44.350 --> 04:47.353
Mac, you'll be running
a horrible risk.

04:47.353 --> 04:50.356
I know I asked,
but you were just a name then,

04:50.356 --> 04:52.358
not a man I like.

04:52.859 --> 04:55.361
Well, it's too
late now, Sarah.

04:55.361 --> 04:57.363
.
I've got my orders

04:57.363 --> 04:59.365
What about the rest
of the plan?

04:59.365 --> 05:00.366
t
Well, I can't
figure that ou

05:00.867 --> 05:02.368
...
until I get inside

05:02.368 --> 05:04.370
:
but it's a nice th
ing about this country

05:04.370 --> 05:06.873
they make it real ea
sy to get into prison.

05:06.873 --> 05:08.875
What are you going to do?

05:08.875 --> 05:12.378
(policemen shouting
in Arabic)

05:14.881 --> 05:17.383
Just wait 
for my signal.

05:22.388 --> 05:25.391
All right, guys, nice.

05:25.391 --> 05:27.894
Two points, take down.
Cops beat peasant.

05:29.896 --> 05:33.399
Oh, that's what I like to see:
tax dollars at work.

05:33.399 --> 05:35.401
(policemen laughing)
Yeah.

05:35.401 --> 05:40.406
Listen, guys,
for a job well done,

05:40.406 --> 05:42.408
I'd like to buy you
a drink.

05:44.911 --> 05:48.414
Hope a sodie-pop'll do
for you.

05:48.414 --> 05:50.917
(policemen shouting)

05:50.917 --> 05:53.419
Come on, come on.

06:14.941 --> 06:18.444
I understand you assaulted
two police officers, MacGyver.

06:18.444 --> 06:20.947
e.
Well, it seemed like
 a good idea at the tim

06:20.947 --> 06:22.949
They were lean
ing pretty heavy

06:22.949 --> 06:24.951
on a peddler
out there.

06:25.451 --> 06:26.953
Do you still think
it's a good idea?

06:27.453 --> 06:30.456
Well, they left him and beat
on me, if that's what you mean.

06:30.456 --> 06:33.459
Oh, I'll explain precisely
what I mean.

06:33.459 --> 06:35.962
You are no longer
an American

06:35.962 --> 06:38.464
or privileged
or a Westerner.

06:38.464 --> 06:40.967
You are garbage.
You are a convict.

06:41.467 --> 06:44.971
You see, here,
we have... true democracy.

06:44.971 --> 06:46.472
All are equal in the dirt.

06:46.472 --> 06:48.474
The intelligent rise,

06:48.474 --> 06:50.476
and the stupid remain
in the dirt

06:50.977 --> 06:51.978
or are buried there.

06:51.978 --> 06:52.979
Clear?

06:52.979 --> 06:54.480
Very.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.982
You have no money.

06:55.982 --> 06:57.483
I suggest you find some.

06:57.483 --> 06:59.485
Otherwise, you will have
neither shelter nor food.

06:59.986 --> 07:01.487
What, you don't
feed us in here?

07:01.487 --> 07:03.990
Of course...
at reasonable prices.

07:03.990 --> 07:06.492
Uh-huh.

07:06.492 --> 07:08.995
ey?
So, how do I c
ome about this mon

07:08.995 --> 07:11.998
Earn it. Beg it.

07:11.998 --> 07:14.000
Find yourself a protector.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.002
As of now,

07:16.002 --> 07:18.504
your survival is
your responsibility, American.

07:18.504 --> 07:19.505
Villars,

07:19.505 --> 07:22.008
y.
take him awa

07:32.018 --> 07:35.521
Relax. He gives
that same speech

07:35.521 --> 07:38.024
to every foreigner
who comes in here.

07:38.024 --> 07:40.026
It's only 80% true.

07:40.026 --> 07:41.527
g.
That's comfortin

07:41.527 --> 07:44.530
Did you really assault
two police

07:44.530 --> 07:46.032
over a street peddler?

07:46.032 --> 07:49.035
Over an old man wh
o was being beaten

07:49.035 --> 07:50.536
.
without reason

07:50.536 --> 07:54.540
Noble, but foolish,
wouldn't you say?

07:54.540 --> 07:58.044
Yeah... but it
sure felt great.

07:58.044 --> 08:00.546
I'm sure it did,
my friend.

08:00.546 --> 08:03.049
I'm Fran?ois Villars.

08:03.049 --> 08:05.551
c.
MacGyver. Call me Ma

08:09.055 --> 08:11.057
(men shouting)

08:28.074 --> 08:30.576
COMMANDANT (over P.A.):
Attention!

08:31.077 --> 08:32.578
Attention!

08:32.578 --> 08:34.080
Hafiz ben Achmed,
report to my office.

08:34.580 --> 08:39.085
Hafiz ben Achmed, come to the
Commandant's office at once!

08:41.587 --> 08:43.089
Who lives here?

08:43.089 --> 08:45.091
Khan.

08:45.091 --> 08:48.094
Don't stare.
Khan doesn't like it.

08:48.594 --> 08:51.597
Oh, yeah?

08:51.597 --> 08:53.599
Which one's Khan?
VILLARS:
The man with the bald head.

08:54.100 --> 08:57.103
He runs the prison,
and Fuad is his dog.

08:57.103 --> 08:59.605
MacGYVER:
That overweight enforcer
he's got?

08:59.605 --> 09:01.607
Fuad killed five men

09:02.108 --> 09:03.609
with his bare hands.

09:03.609 --> 09:05.611
Two of them
inside the prison.

09:07.113 --> 09:08.614
Ah...

09:08.614 --> 09:11.617
Interesting.

09:15.121 --> 09:16.122
You want him?

09:16.622 --> 09:19.625
Not yet. Ask around.

09:20.126 --> 09:21.627
See if anyone knows
something about him.

09:21.627 --> 09:25.131
-
Only three sorts of
Americans end up here-

09:25.131 --> 09:27.133
drug dealers,

09:27.133 --> 09:29.635
soldiers of fortune...

09:29.635 --> 09:31.137
or madmen.

09:31.137 --> 09:33.139
...
I want to
know which

09:33.139 --> 09:36.642
so I can use him
or get rid of him.

09:50.156 --> 09:53.659
I'll make coffee.
You take the top bunk.

09:55.661 --> 09:58.664
You're doing me
a considerable
favor, Fran?ois.

09:58.664 --> 10:01.667
MacGyver, you're American.

10:02.168 --> 10:05.171
I am...wasFrench.

10:05.171 --> 10:07.673
Different nations,
different cultures.

10:07.673 --> 10:09.675
.
We're both
foreigners

10:09.675 --> 10:11.177
We can at leas
t talk together.

10:11.177 --> 10:13.179
er.
Consid

10:13.179 --> 10:17.683
We shall have ample time
for conversation.

10:17.683 --> 10:20.186
Now, with all due respect,
Fran?ois,

10:20.186 --> 10:21.687
I don't plan to be here
that long.

10:21.687 --> 10:23.689
Escape?

10:23.689 --> 10:26.192
.
Every new man
talks about escape

10:26.192 --> 10:27.693
Nobody succeeds.

10:27.693 --> 10:29.695
Well, maybe it's about time

10:30.196 --> 10:33.699
I expanded the realm
of possibilities around here.

10:33.699 --> 10:36.702
You play soccer?

10:36.702 --> 10:38.704
MacGYVER:
Badly. That olive oil?

10:38.704 --> 10:40.706
Don't tell me an American
is interested

10:40.706 --> 10:41.707
?
in cuisine

10:41.707 --> 10:43.209
Actually, I'm not.

10:44.710 --> 10:45.711
Mind if I borrow this?

10:45.711 --> 10:47.213
VILLARS:
Be my guest.

10:59.225 --> 11:01.227
Ah, you can look,

11:01.227 --> 11:05.731
but you can't touch

11:05.731 --> 11:07.733
that little tint of blue

11:07.733 --> 11:10.736
which prisoners call... the sky.

11:11.237 --> 11:13.239
You may be
right, Fran?ois,

11:13.239 --> 11:15.741
but they can only lock me up,

11:15.741 --> 11:18.744
not my mind.

11:47.773 --> 11:50.276
MacGyver, what are you doing?

11:50.776 --> 11:53.279
A little experiment.

11:53.279 --> 11:55.281
What sort of experiment?

11:55.281 --> 11:57.283
Fran?ois, the first men
to fly over Paris

11:57.283 --> 12:00.786
were French--
the Montgolfier brothers.

12:00.786 --> 12:02.288
e.
Of cours

12:02.288 --> 12:06.792
The first... hot air balloons.

12:07.293 --> 12:08.294
Mon Dieu!

12:08.294 --> 12:10.796
x.
Marveilleu

12:54.340 --> 12:57.343
al.
You are sending a sign

12:57.343 --> 12:58.844
Outside contact.

13:06.352 --> 13:07.853
All right!

13:15.861 --> 13:17.863
(engine starts)

13:21.367 --> 13:22.868
VILLARS:
I am starting to see
the beginnings

13:22.868 --> 13:24.370
of a very good plan.

13:24.370 --> 13:27.873
Yeah, it's kind of
put together on the cuff,

13:27.873 --> 13:30.376
but it just might work.

13:30.376 --> 13:31.877
You wanna come along?

13:31.877 --> 13:33.379
Yes.

13:35.381 --> 13:38.384
But no.

13:38.384 --> 13:40.886
I have been here
five years,mon ami,

13:40.886 --> 13:44.890
for the crime ofnot
bribing a judge.

13:44.890 --> 13:47.393
n
I have a wif
e, five childre

13:47.393 --> 13:50.396
and six more months to go.

13:50.396 --> 13:52.398
I understand.

13:52.398 --> 13:54.400
But I will help you.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.901
No.

13:55.901 --> 13:57.903
No, you shouldn't
jeopardize everything

13:57.903 --> 13:58.904
this close to release.

13:58.904 --> 14:00.406
It's not worth
the risk.

14:00.406 --> 14:06.412
MacGyver, the great risk
in this ugly little prison world

14:06.412 --> 14:09.915
is that we forget to be human.

14:10.416 --> 14:13.419
We forget we have pride,
feelings, courage.

14:13.419 --> 14:17.423
I would like to remember
those things.

14:17.423 --> 14:21.927
And, besides, how can one
not help a maniac

14:21.927 --> 14:25.931
who assaults two policem
en in the name of justice?

14:29.435 --> 14:30.436
Thank you.

14:30.436 --> 14:32.438
First thing I have to do

14:32.438 --> 14:35.941
is contact a prisoner by
the name of Brian Ashford.

14:35.941 --> 14:37.443
al.
He's a politic

14:37.443 --> 14:38.444
Mm-hmm.

14:38.444 --> 14:39.945
g.
That's a special win

14:40.446 --> 14:44.450
d.
Heavy security, extra
guards, every cell bugge

14:44.450 --> 14:46.452
u!
FU
AD: Yo

14:46.452 --> 14:48.954
Khan wants to see you.

14:48.954 --> 14:50.956
Oh, yeah? What for?

14:52.458 --> 14:52.958
Mac!

14:58.464 --> 14:59.965
(grunts)

15:00.966 --> 15:02.968
I'm Fuad!

15:02.968 --> 15:04.970
(Fuad laughing)

15:04.970 --> 15:06.472
Fuad!

15:09.975 --> 15:11.477
(yells)

15:11.477 --> 15:12.978
(cheering)

15:15.981 --> 15:18.984
Listen, I hope you're
taking this personally.

15:30.496 --> 15:31.497
What is this?

15:33.999 --> 15:35.501
(growling)

15:39.505 --> 15:40.506
No!

15:41.507 --> 15:43.008
Not yet.

16:02.528 --> 16:06.532
(soft, slightly distorted
music playing)

16:10.035 --> 16:11.537
(groans)

16:11.537 --> 16:13.539
Thanks.

16:18.544 --> 16:19.545
p.
Clean yourself u

16:19.545 --> 16:21.547
And don't dirty my carpet.

16:28.554 --> 16:30.556
I am Khan.

16:30.556 --> 16:33.058
Yeah, I've heard about you.

16:33.058 --> 16:37.062
Rumor has it you run the joint.

16:40.065 --> 16:41.567
.
MacGYVER:
It's phase

16:41.567 --> 16:43.068
at?
KH
AN: Wh

16:43.068 --> 16:46.071
Phase-- your speakers
are out of phase.

16:50.075 --> 16:51.076
s?
Mind if I borrow thi

16:52.578 --> 16:55.581
(music continues)

17:10.596 --> 17:14.098
KHAN:
Do you know
what you are doing?

17:14.098 --> 17:16.602
Well, I sure hope so.

17:19.104 --> 17:21.106
You interest me, American.

17:21.607 --> 17:22.107
Yeah?

17:22.608 --> 17:25.109
Soldier of fortune?

17:25.109 --> 17:27.112
Political?

17:28.614 --> 17:29.615
I know, I know.

17:29.615 --> 17:33.118
Drug dealer.
Smuggler.

17:33.619 --> 17:37.623
A man motivated
by intelligent greed.

17:37.623 --> 17:40.125
There. I think that's got it.

17:40.125 --> 17:42.628
(undistorted music plays)

17:42.628 --> 17:44.630
Very good.

17:45.130 --> 17:46.131
Thanks.
(turns off music)

17:46.131 --> 17:48.133
(mechanical whirring)

17:48.634 --> 17:50.636
You know, it would
n't be much harder

17:50.636 --> 17:53.138
to fix that refrigerator
in your PCP lab.

17:53.138 --> 17:54.640
It's awfully noisy.

17:54.640 --> 17:55.641
.
It's not efficient

17:55.641 --> 17:58.644
You seem to be very well
informed, MacGyver.

17:58.644 --> 18:02.147
.
Yeah, well, word on th
e yard is you deal drugs

18:02.648 --> 18:05.150
The easiest one
to manufacture is PCP.

18:05.150 --> 18:08.654
re.
I saw the vent outside
and heard the noises in he

18:08.654 --> 18:10.656
.
Pieces all seem to fit

18:10.656 --> 18:11.657
Very impressive.

18:11.657 --> 18:13.158
Thanks.

18:13.158 --> 18:15.160
There's one piece
that doesn't fit, though.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.663
The last thing management
needs around here

18:17.663 --> 18:19.665
is a prison full of dust heads

18:19.665 --> 18:20.666
e.
busting 
up the plac

18:20.666 --> 18:24.169
I make it in here,
but I sell it on the outside.

18:24.169 --> 18:25.671
,
Well, there ya are
. If it's a business

18:25.671 --> 18:28.173
?
why not make i
t more efficient

18:28.173 --> 18:31.176
ff.
Less risk.
Better quality stu

18:31.677 --> 18:33.679
Efficient.
You know the process?

18:33.679 --> 18:34.680
You bet.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.682
ut.
Could double your outp

18:37.182 --> 18:39.184
My formula.

18:43.689 --> 18:46.191
What do you want in return?

18:46.191 --> 18:49.194
Half an hour with Brian Ashford.

18:49.194 --> 18:50.195
In private.

18:50.195 --> 18:51.196
on.
He's in security secti

18:51.196 --> 18:53.198
I know, but what is
your business with him?

18:53.198 --> 18:55.701
It's private.

18:55.701 --> 18:57.202
I could have Fuad ask you.

18:59.705 --> 19:01.206
.
Yeah, you
sure could

19:01.206 --> 19:03.208
But it'd be kinda tough

19:03.208 --> 19:06.211
for me to fix up
your PCP lab if I was dead.

19:06.211 --> 19:09.214
I think we have
an understanding, MacGyver.

19:09.214 --> 19:10.716
Good.

19:11.216 --> 19:13.719
Well, we had an understanding,
all right.

19:13.719 --> 19:16.221
I think Khan figured me
for a sucker,

19:16.221 --> 19:19.725
and I knew the Commandant
had every cell bugged,

19:19.725 --> 19:22.728
so I guess my plan was working.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.736
For who?

19:30.736 --> 19:32.738
Brian Ashford.

19:33.238 --> 19:34.740
All right.

19:34.740 --> 19:37.242
He's on exercise hour.

19:38.243 --> 19:39.745
re.
Posture, postu

19:48.253 --> 19:50.756
Name's MacGyver.

19:50.756 --> 19:53.258
Yes, I was told to expect you.

19:53.258 --> 19:55.761
Frankly, I'm surprised
you got this far.

19:55.761 --> 19:57.763
Well, we're gonna go a lot
further than this, Brian.

19:57.763 --> 20:00.766
I'm gonna get ya outta here.

20:00.766 --> 20:01.767
BRIAN:
Oh? How?

20:02.267 --> 20:03.769
MacGYVER:
Working on that.

20:03.769 --> 20:05.771
With your sister,
as a matter of fact.

20:06.271 --> 20:07.272
Just thought you'd like to know.

20:07.272 --> 20:09.775
Well, I'm grateful.

20:09.775 --> 20:12.277
Frankly, you've taken
a terrible risk.

20:12.277 --> 20:13.779
Well, I don't know.

20:13.779 --> 20:17.783
Sarah told me about
all the work you do with kids.

20:17.783 --> 20:19.785
How can I help you?

20:19.785 --> 20:21.787
Well, first of all,

20:21.787 --> 20:24.790
you can tell me about the
security system around here.

20:24.790 --> 20:27.292
How many locks, who has keys,

20:27.292 --> 20:31.296
when the guards change shift,

20:31.296 --> 20:33.298
.
and especially
the night security

20:33.298 --> 20:35.801
But most importantly...

20:38.303 --> 20:40.305
e,
when we fly the
Huey choppers in her

20:40.305 --> 20:42.307
can you still handle
a .30 millimeter?

20:42.808 --> 20:44.309
Definitely, yes.

20:44.309 --> 20:46.812
So it's an aerial assault,
is it then?

20:46.812 --> 20:48.814
Yeah, for the most part.

20:48.814 --> 20:51.316
Your sister tells me
you stashed $10 million

20:51.316 --> 20:52.818
before you were busted.

20:52.818 --> 20:54.319
BRIAN:
Actually it was 12.

20:54.319 --> 20:55.320
MacGYVER:
Ah, well, then you can see

20:55.320 --> 20:56.822
you're well worth
the effort for us.

20:56.822 --> 20:59.324
My people are willing to use
gunships to free you.

20:59.825 --> 21:02.327
e.
Well, that's,
that's remarkabl

21:02.828 --> 21:04.329
is.
I'm delighted
you're handling th

21:04.329 --> 21:06.832
It's good to meet you, too.

21:06.832 --> 21:09.835
But I must admit you're
not quite what I expected

21:09.835 --> 21:11.336
in a medical missionary.

21:11.336 --> 21:14.840
Oh, well, never be taken i
n by surface appearances.

21:14.840 --> 21:15.841
Actually, I rais
ed a little hell

21:16.341 --> 21:17.342
en.
before I came
to believe in Heav

21:17.342 --> 21:18.343
Ah, good.

21:18.343 --> 21:19.845
And every now and then
, a minor miracle.

21:19.845 --> 21:21.346
Well, I'm not sure
I can provide that,

21:21.847 --> 21:23.348
but I'll definitely
get you out of here.

21:23.348 --> 21:25.350
.
Well, I pray that you're right

21:29.354 --> 21:30.856
And may God be with you.

21:30.856 --> 21:34.359
KHAN:
As I said, Excellency,
he's not what he seems.

21:34.860 --> 21:37.863
ct.
And you were corre

21:37.863 --> 21:39.364
You want MacGyver removed?

21:39.865 --> 21:43.869
No. Soldier of fortune
. Helicopters.

21:43.869 --> 21:45.871
12 million American dollars.

21:45.871 --> 21:48.373
ng.
No, I want to know
every possible thi

21:48.373 --> 21:49.374
.
Everything

21:49.374 --> 21:50.375
And then?

21:50.375 --> 21:54.379
im.
And then... you kill h

22:01.787 --> 22:04.289
VILLARS:
Tell me about your visit
to the political

22:04.289 --> 22:05.791
security section.

22:05.791 --> 22:07.292
d
Well, I just wante

22:07.292 --> 22:09.795
to prepare my friend
for the breakout.

22:09.795 --> 22:13.298
With Khan's help?

22:13.298 --> 22:15.300
MacGyver, Khan would
sell you down

22:15.300 --> 22:16.301
for a second cup of coffee.

22:16.802 --> 22:17.803
ah?
Ye

22:17.803 --> 22:21.807
Well, sure wish you'd
consider coming with us.

22:21.807 --> 22:23.308
ne.
The water's fi

22:23.308 --> 22:25.811
I'll miss you, my friend.

22:25.811 --> 22:28.814
Well, now that sounds like
you think I'm gonna make it.

22:28.814 --> 22:30.816
I have my doubts.

22:30.816 --> 22:35.320
But some men aren't
designed to be caged.

22:35.320 --> 22:41.326
And, besides, I had forgotten
how good it is to have a friend.

22:41.326 --> 22:42.828
To help a friend.

22:43.328 --> 22:45.831
Thank you, Fran?ois.

22:45.831 --> 22:49.835
So... what can I do?

22:51.336 --> 22:54.339
ce,
Well, I know you can get
into the Commandant's offi

22:54.840 --> 22:56.842
re?
but do you know how to
run the P.A. system he

22:56.842 --> 22:57.843
Mm-hmm.

22:59.845 --> 23:01.346
MacGyver,

23:01.346 --> 23:02.848
e.
your wife is her

23:04.850 --> 23:06.351
Oh, yeah?

23:15.360 --> 23:17.362
MacGYVER:
So, how's she lookin'?

23:17.362 --> 23:19.865
Very beautiful.

23:28.373 --> 23:29.374
Thank you.

23:33.879 --> 23:35.881
Darling.

23:46.892 --> 23:48.393
Did you see Brian?

23:48.393 --> 23:52.898
.
Yeah. He's quite a guy

23:56.902 --> 23:59.404
How did you arrang
e this so fast?

23:59.404 --> 24:00.405
I told you.

24:00.405 --> 24:01.907
Bribery works

24:01.907 --> 24:03.909
wonders in here.

24:03.909 --> 24:05.911
Oh, have I missed you!

24:05.911 --> 24:07.412
MacGYVER:
I missed you, too.

24:07.412 --> 24:08.413
At least we have tonight.

24:08.413 --> 24:11.416
Oh, heh-heh-heh...

24:11.416 --> 24:13.919
t.
Tell me about th
is lawyer you've go

24:13.919 --> 24:15.921
Lawyer?

24:16.421 --> 24:18.924
Of course, but can't we
talk about that later?

24:18.924 --> 24:21.927
(whispers):
I've got the vehicles.

24:21.927 --> 24:24.930
When, how, where?

24:27.933 --> 24:29.935
Tomorrow.

24:30.435 --> 24:31.436
High noon.

24:31.436 --> 24:35.440
MacGYVER:
That's when the choppers
come in.

24:35.941 --> 24:37.943
.
Northwest gate

24:37.943 --> 24:39.945
Are you positive?

24:41.446 --> 24:43.949
t?
Would I tell you I
loved you if I didn'

24:43.949 --> 24:46.952
SARAH:
Mac, I didn't realize
how much I'd missed you.

24:54.459 --> 24:56.962
(excited shouting
and chatter)

24:59.464 --> 25:01.967
It's a breakaway.

25:01.967 --> 25:03.969
Shoot! Great shot!

25:05.470 --> 25:07.973
All in the footwork, big guy!

25:09.474 --> 25:10.475
Hey, just go in.

25:10.475 --> 25:11.977
You bet!

25:16.481 --> 25:17.482
'?
How are you doin

25:17.482 --> 25:18.483
Come in.

25:18.483 --> 25:20.485
Pleasant night?

25:20.485 --> 25:21.987
Yeah, it wasn't bad.

25:21.987 --> 25:23.989
Not much privacy
around here, though.

25:23.989 --> 25:25.991
We're a very close-knit
community.

25:25.991 --> 25:27.993
I've kind of noticed that.

25:27.993 --> 25:29.494
So, uh,

25:29.494 --> 25:31.496
how's the stereo workin'?

25:31.496 --> 25:32.998
e.
It's fin

25:32.998 --> 25:35.000
ay.
This w

25:36.501 --> 25:38.003
(mechanical whirring)

25:38.003 --> 25:41.006
Yeah, you know, I figure
we can triple your output.

25:41.006 --> 25:43.508
All you'd need is a couple
of adjustments

25:43.508 --> 25:44.509
g.
on this thin

25:44.509 --> 25:46.511
Fix it.

25:46.511 --> 25:49.514
By the way, how was your visit
with Brian Ashford?

25:49.514 --> 25:50.515
Oh, it was great!

25:51.016 --> 25:52.017
It was just wonderful.

25:52.517 --> 25:53.518
Very interesting.

25:53.518 --> 25:54.519
He's an old pal, you know?

25:54.519 --> 25:55.520
KHAN:
Really?

25:56.021 --> 25:57.522
It's very fortunate for you

25:57.522 --> 26:00.025
to find an old friend
in this unlikely place.

26:00.025 --> 26:02.527
Yeah.

26:02.527 --> 26:04.529
You're a lucky man,
MacGyver.

26:12.537 --> 26:14.539
Yeah.

26:14.539 --> 26:17.542
(low humming
of fan blades)

26:24.049 --> 26:26.051
(clattering)

26:34.059 --> 26:36.561
(rhythmic tapping)

26:37.562 --> 26:40.065
Yes. They have nothing on

26:40.065 --> 26:41.066
MacGyver, nothing.

26:41.066 --> 26:42.067
Oh.

26:42.567 --> 26:43.568
Don't be stupid!

26:43.568 --> 26:45.070
That means heisa professional.

26:45.070 --> 26:47.072
He is obviously moving
on his plan

26:47.072 --> 26:48.073
to break Ashford out.

26:48.073 --> 26:50.575
That is why I had to tell you.

26:52.077 --> 26:53.578
e,
You had to tell 
me because otherwis

26:53.578 --> 26:54.579
I would have
you gutted

26:54.579 --> 26:56.581
and strung o
ut in the sun!

26:58.583 --> 27:00.585
Why do you talk
to me like that?

27:01.086 --> 27:03.588
Perhaps to remind
you of what you are.

27:05.090 --> 27:07.092
am.
Or what I

27:09.094 --> 27:11.596
.
Can't take chances

27:12.097 --> 27:14.099
f.
I'll have men
stationed on the roo

27:14.099 --> 27:16.601
r.
You stay
with MacGyve

27:16.601 --> 27:18.603
Thank you, Excellency.

27:36.621 --> 27:38.623
(rhythmic clicking)

27:59.644 --> 28:04.649
MacGYVER:
The one useful thing
about PCP is, it explodes.

28:05.150 --> 28:07.152
Add a volatile liquid,

28:07.152 --> 28:11.156
and you've got a bomb
you can wear anyplace.

28:11.156 --> 28:14.159
Attention, this is
the Commandant speaking.

28:14.159 --> 28:19.164
Lieutenant Nasa, report
to the guard post immediately.

28:19.164 --> 28:22.667
All prisoners' privileges
are hereby suspended.

28:22.667 --> 28:25.170
Prisoners are restricted
to the main compound.

28:25.670 --> 28:27.672
There will be no exceptions.

28:28.173 --> 28:29.674
Guard units five, six and eight,

28:30.175 --> 28:32.177
draw automatic weapons,
extra ammunition

28:32.177 --> 28:35.180
and take positions.

28:35.180 --> 28:39.684
Units two, three and seven,
report to the roof at once.

28:39.684 --> 28:42.687
This is a full alert.

28:44.689 --> 28:47.192
MacGYVER:
Well, the Commandant ought
to be getting ready

28:47.192 --> 28:50.195
for those imaginary choppers.

28:50.695 --> 28:52.697
I hate to disappoint a friend,

28:52.697 --> 28:56.201
so I got to create
a little excitement.

28:56.201 --> 29:00.705
The problem isn't
how to blow up the PCP.

29:00.705 --> 29:05.210
The problem is,
timing it... just right.

29:05.210 --> 29:06.711
(fan blades whirring)

29:06.711 --> 29:08.213
Any spark'll do it.

29:08.213 --> 29:10.215
All you need is
an electrical circuit

29:10.215 --> 29:13.218
that'll close
when you want it to.

29:14.719 --> 29:18.223
Which better happen
when you're out of the room.

29:22.227 --> 29:25.230
Now, the thing about ice--

29:25.230 --> 29:29.734
at a given temperature,
it'll melt at a given rate.

29:31.736 --> 29:34.239
Just about as good as a clock,

29:34.239 --> 29:37.242
especially
if you don't have a clock.

29:39.744 --> 29:41.746
(knock at door)

29:50.755 --> 29:53.258
I brought 
you something.

29:53.258 --> 29:54.759
it.
You will like

29:54.759 --> 29:56.261
Ha! Halvah!

29:56.261 --> 29:58.763
Ah, you're a good sort, Villars.

30:00.765 --> 30:03.268
Mmm! I'll be sorry
to see you go.

30:03.268 --> 30:05.270
I'll miss you, too.

30:05.270 --> 30:07.772
Or else, I'd leave, uh, today.

30:08.273 --> 30:09.274
Noon.

30:19.284 --> 30:21.286
COMMANDANT:
Be alert! The attack could come
at any moment.

30:21.786 --> 30:23.288
LIEUTENANT:
What about the prisoners, sir?

30:23.288 --> 30:26.291
COMMANDANT:
Lieutenant, the only threat is
from the air.

30:28.793 --> 30:30.295
(low, rhythmic whirring
continues)

31:02.327 --> 31:04.329
Hey, how are you
doin', Sunshine?

31:04.829 --> 31:05.830
re.
Listen, I'm al
l finished in he

31:05.830 --> 31:07.332
It's running l
ike a Swiss watch.

31:07.332 --> 31:09.334
So, I guess I'm gone, huh?

31:09.334 --> 31:10.835
t!
Don't hi

31:10.835 --> 31:12.837
Not quite.

31:12.837 --> 31:15.840
It think it's time
our secrets were out.

31:16.341 --> 31:20.345
Fact: Brian Ashford is worth
a great deal of money.

31:20.345 --> 31:21.846
12 million.

31:21.846 --> 31:23.848
Now, I want some details.

31:23.848 --> 31:26.351
Who's paying you?
How much?

31:26.351 --> 31:28.353
And how did you plan
to break him out?

31:30.355 --> 31:31.856
Yeah. All right.

31:31.856 --> 31:33.358
You're right abo
ut the 12 million.

31:33.858 --> 31:36.361
I contracted to get hi
m out of here for 10%.

31:36.861 --> 31:37.862
t,
Why don't 
you help me ou

31:38.363 --> 31:39.364
it?
and we
'll split

31:39.364 --> 31:41.866
You expect me
to simply trust you?

31:41.866 --> 31:44.369
Who hired you?

31:44.369 --> 31:46.371
Where do they plan
to take Ashford?

31:46.871 --> 31:48.373
Details!

31:48.373 --> 31:49.874
r
MacGYVER:
I've got the numbe

31:49.874 --> 31:51.876
.
of the Swiss
safety deposit box

31:51.876 --> 31:53.378
I've got the map
and the box number

31:53.378 --> 31:55.380
stashed across the way.

31:55.380 --> 31:57.382
Come on.

31:57.882 --> 31:59.884
I'll give you all the names.

31:59.884 --> 32:02.387
(dripping onto metal tin)

32:17.402 --> 32:19.404
(brakes squealing)

32:37.922 --> 32:40.425
(speaking in native language,
laughing)

32:43.428 --> 32:45.430
(excited chatter and shouting)

32:45.930 --> 32:48.933
MacGYVER:
Well, what do you know?

32:48.933 --> 32:50.435
Hook, line and sinker.

32:50.935 --> 32:53.438
The Commandant's plan
was working just fine.

32:53.438 --> 32:57.442
And if his was workin',
so was mine.

32:57.442 --> 32:59.444
Mr. Villars,

32:59.444 --> 33:01.446
didn't you tell me
you could trade this

33:01.446 --> 33:02.947
for some food?

33:02.947 --> 33:04.449
.
I will try

33:04.449 --> 33:06.451
Is it in good shape?

33:06.451 --> 33:07.952
You bet.
Good.

33:07.952 --> 33:08.953
Let's go.

33:09.454 --> 33:11.456
an.
Move it, m

33:11.456 --> 33:14.959
Fuad, you are one miserable
son of a diseased camel.

33:16.961 --> 33:19.464
(water dripping)

33:28.973 --> 33:31.476
(men shouting,
excited chatter)

33:31.476 --> 33:33.478
Well, guys,
this is where it is.

33:33.478 --> 33:36.981
No one ever thinks
to bury anything under a fire.

33:39.984 --> 33:41.986
Can I borrow your knife?

33:43.988 --> 33:46.491
To dig!

33:51.496 --> 33:53.498
Thank you.

34:04.509 --> 34:07.011
MacGYVER:
I had my clocks ticking...

34:07.011 --> 34:10.514
inside the PCP lab...

34:10.514 --> 34:12.516
(water dripping)

34:15.520 --> 34:18.523
...and in the Commandant's
office.

34:24.027 --> 34:26.531
(beeping)

34:44.549 --> 34:46.551
(water dripping)

34:59.063 --> 35:00.565
(knocking)

35:06.571 --> 35:07.572
Hey, what's that?

35:07.572 --> 35:09.574
et.
I'm sellin
g him a jack

35:11.075 --> 35:13.077
s.
You don't have eno
ugh heat in these cell

35:13.077 --> 35:14.579
d.
WARDER:
Yeah, too ba

35:15.079 --> 35:17.081
(quietly):
Light the left poc
ket and get clear.

35:17.081 --> 35:18.082
The pocket?

35:18.583 --> 35:19.083
Exactly.

35:19.584 --> 35:20.585
But when?

35:20.585 --> 35:22.086
WARDER:
Hey, come here
, come on!

35:22.086 --> 35:23.087
Minutes.

35:23.087 --> 35:24.088
Thank you.

35:24.589 --> 35:26.591
.
Don't thank me

35:26.591 --> 35:28.593
You paid for it.

35:33.097 --> 35:35.099
(door closes)

35:36.100 --> 35:38.603
(water dripping)

35:44.609 --> 35:46.611
(beep, recorder clicks on)

35:46.611 --> 35:48.613
(fan blades on tape sounding
like helicopter whirring)

35:50.615 --> 35:52.116
(excited chatter)

35:52.116 --> 35:55.119
(shouting)

36:00.124 --> 36:02.126
(shouting)

36:06.130 --> 36:08.132
COMMANDANT:
They are coming
from the northeast!

36:08.132 --> 36:09.634
From behind the cloud cover.
Sound the alarm!

36:09.634 --> 36:10.635
All right.

36:11.135 --> 36:12.637
(alarm wailing)

36:14.639 --> 36:16.641
(men shouting)

36:16.641 --> 36:17.642
(alarm wailing)

36:19.143 --> 36:21.145
Yeah, well, that's it.

36:21.145 --> 36:22.146
(yells)

36:23.648 --> 36:25.650
(water dripping)

36:27.652 --> 36:29.654
(men shouting)

36:29.654 --> 36:31.656
(plaster shattering)

36:31.656 --> 36:32.657
(tapping phone receiver)

36:33.157 --> 36:34.158
Let's go.

36:45.169 --> 36:46.671
(explosion)

36:54.178 --> 36:55.680
Quickly. Let's go.

36:59.183 --> 37:01.185
(water dripping)

37:07.692 --> 37:08.693
(electrical zapping)

37:09.193 --> 37:10.695
(explosion)

37:10.695 --> 37:13.698
(shocked yelling)

37:13.698 --> 37:15.199
(guards shouting, gunshots)

37:20.705 --> 37:21.706
(shouting)

37:23.207 --> 37:26.210
(tires screeching)

37:26.210 --> 37:29.714
(men shouting, explosions)

37:29.714 --> 37:31.215
(tires screeching)

37:31.716 --> 37:33.718
(explosions)

37:36.220 --> 37:37.722
(distant shouting)

37:38.222 --> 37:40.224
Through the tunnel
to the right.

37:45.229 --> 37:46.731
(explosions and shouting)

37:46.731 --> 37:48.232
go.
Let's

37:48.733 --> 37:52.236
(confused shouting, gunshots)

37:52.737 --> 37:54.238
MacGYVER:
Fran?ois.

37:54.739 --> 37:55.740
MacGyver.

37:57.241 --> 37:59.243
.
Go with God, my friend

38:01.245 --> 38:02.246
Secure the gates!

38:05.249 --> 38:08.753
(tires screeching)

38:11.756 --> 38:14.759
(men shouting,
alarm wailing)

38:14.759 --> 38:16.761
Helicopter attack.

38:16.761 --> 38:17.762
You moron!

38:17.762 --> 38:19.764
Half of my men
are still up there!

38:20.264 --> 38:21.265
Where's MacGyver?

38:21.265 --> 38:22.767
I don't know.

38:22.767 --> 38:26.270
I thought...

38:26.270 --> 38:28.773
Everything I have is gone.

38:28.773 --> 38:30.775
Oh, no.

38:30.775 --> 38:32.276
For the rest of your sentence,

38:32.276 --> 38:34.779
you will have total
and undisputed possession

38:34.779 --> 38:35.780
of an isolation cell!

38:36.280 --> 38:38.282
Take him away!

38:38.282 --> 38:39.784
I will kill you!

38:57.301 --> 38:59.804
(distant sirens wailing)

38:59.804 --> 39:01.806
What are you doing?

39:01.806 --> 39:02.807
(gunshot, steam hissing)

39:02.807 --> 39:04.809
(gunshot)

39:04.809 --> 39:05.810
BRIAN:
Terrific.

39:06.310 --> 39:07.812
Well, then,
the pursuit stops here.

39:07.812 --> 39:10.815
That's a bloody marvelous
roadblock.

39:10.815 --> 39:12.316
I think we can dispense
with MacGyver now.

39:17.321 --> 39:19.323
I'm sorry, Mac.

39:19.323 --> 39:20.825
What for?

39:20.825 --> 39:24.328
I'm not the All-American girl
you met at the orphanage.

39:24.829 --> 39:27.832
Oh... I get it.

39:27.832 --> 39:30.334
And he's not your brother,

39:30.334 --> 39:32.336
and he's not
a medical missionary.

39:32.336 --> 39:34.338
And I've got egg
all over my face.

39:34.839 --> 39:37.341
A blind faith tends to do that
to people, now doesn't it?

39:37.341 --> 39:40.344
I think it was Sister Ann's
confidence in Sarah

39:40.344 --> 39:42.346
that fooled me.

39:42.847 --> 39:43.848
So what is it?

39:43.848 --> 39:45.850
Heroin? Coke? What?

39:45.850 --> 39:48.352
No, just duty.

39:48.352 --> 39:51.355
I'm a representative
of the Soviet government.

39:51.355 --> 39:53.858
My job is to deliver weapons

39:53.858 --> 39:56.360
to our allies in
the Third World.

39:56.360 --> 39:57.862
Oh, that's terrific.

39:57.862 --> 40:02.867
Not milk or medicine,
but explosives, guns.

40:02.867 --> 40:04.869
(sirens approaching)
Congratulations.

40:04.869 --> 40:07.872
Is ol' Brian a Russian, too?

40:07.872 --> 40:10.374
No.

40:10.374 --> 40:11.876
He's a crook
ed arms dealer

40:11.876 --> 40:14.879
who stole the weapons from me
to sell on the black market.

40:15.379 --> 40:16.380
But he ended up
in Harosh Prison

40:16.380 --> 40:17.381
y.
before he could
make the deliver

40:17.381 --> 40:18.883
Yeah, so the deal was

40:19.383 --> 40:21.385
ht?
I get him out and you
get the guns back, rig

40:21.385 --> 40:23.888
Look, must we have all these
maudlin little revelations?

40:23.888 --> 40:25.890
Just kill him
and get it over with

40:25.890 --> 40:26.891
before the gendarmes
show up.

40:26.891 --> 40:28.392
ou.
If I were to kill
anybody, it'd be y

40:28.392 --> 40:29.393
g.
He's a dec
ent human bein

40:29.894 --> 40:33.397
You are a miserable thief.

40:33.397 --> 40:36.901
All I want from you now
are the arms you've hidden.

40:36.901 --> 40:38.402
Have it your way.

40:38.402 --> 40:40.905
But if it were me, I'd kill him.

40:42.907 --> 40:45.409
You're a sweetheart,
Brian. Thanks.

40:45.409 --> 40:46.911
Nothing personal.

40:46.911 --> 40:48.412
(car engine starting)

40:48.412 --> 40:50.915
Everything's personal.

40:52.917 --> 40:54.418
No!

40:54.919 --> 40:56.420
Look out, MacGyver!
(gunshots)

40:58.422 --> 40:59.924
(tires screeching)

41:04.428 --> 41:06.430
.
Let me tell you
something, comrade

41:06.430 --> 41:07.932
,
I've never hit
a woman before

41:07.932 --> 41:08.933
but you've com
e darned close.

41:09.433 --> 41:10.935
I don't blame you, Mac.

41:10.935 --> 41:12.436
t.
But I'll sure give you credi

41:12.937 --> 41:14.438
y.
You sold me a great stor

41:14.438 --> 41:16.440
I had to get
those weapons back

41:16.440 --> 41:19.443
or Brian would sell them
to terrorists.

41:19.443 --> 41:21.445
mn
You trying to te
ll me you give a da

41:21.445 --> 41:23.447
if those weapons are
used on civilians, kids?

41:23.948 --> 41:25.950
(sirens approaching)

41:26.450 --> 41:28.953
Yes, I do.

41:29.453 --> 41:31.956
(sirens approaching)

41:34.959 --> 41:36.961
Come on.

41:42.466 --> 41:44.468
(seagulls squawking)

42:10.494 --> 42:13.497
MacGYVER:
Do you have any idea
where the weapons might be?

42:13.497 --> 42:16.000
SARAH:
They have to be somewh
ere in the harbor area.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.003
So we find Brian's car,
we find the weapons?

42:19.003 --> 42:20.504
Unless you're
setting me up again.

42:20.504 --> 42:22.506
Look, Mac, I'm
sorry about th
at. I really am.

42:22.506 --> 42:25.009
For what?
Because of me?

42:25.009 --> 42:27.011
Or because
Brian double-crossed you again?

42:27.011 --> 42:28.512
He's good at that,
have you noticed?

42:28.512 --> 42:30.514
I wish to point ou
t to you, MacGyver,

42:30.514 --> 42:32.016
the only reaso
n he tricked me

42:32.016 --> 42:35.019
.
was because I stopped him
from blowing your head off

42:35.019 --> 42:37.021
Point to you, Sarah.

42:37.021 --> 42:38.022
Well, I'll giv
e you another.

42:38.022 --> 42:40.024
--
I could have left yo
u behind at the prison

42:40.024 --> 42:42.026
't.
I didn

42:46.530 --> 42:48.532
SARAH:
Now that Brian
is on the loose,

42:48.532 --> 42:50.034
he'll sell that
arms shipment

42:50.034 --> 42:53.537
and he'll be out of
the country by tonight.

42:53.537 --> 42:56.540
k.
Mac, we both have a reas
on to get those weapons bac

42:56.540 --> 43:00.044
All right, I'll play.

43:00.044 --> 43:01.045
With one condition.

43:01.045 --> 43:03.547
If and when we find the weapons,
we destroy them.

43:03.547 --> 43:05.049
Blow them sky-high.

43:05.049 --> 43:07.051
I agree, Mac.

43:07.551 --> 43:09.053
All right.

43:31.575 --> 43:34.078
Come, I'll show you my wares.

43:39.583 --> 43:41.585
There's the car.

43:44.088 --> 43:46.090
Bingo.

43:59.603 --> 44:02.106
So, gentlemen,
what do you think?

44:02.106 --> 44:03.607
Is this what I promised or what?

44:04.108 --> 44:05.109
NIGERI
AN: Yes.

44:05.109 --> 44:06.610
e.
Now let us
discuss pric

44:07.111 --> 44:09.113
Good.

44:10.114 --> 44:12.116
cy.
BRIAN:
Our curren

44:12.116 --> 44:14.618
nt.
And as we agreed, you
take the entire shipme

44:14.618 --> 44:16.620
MAN:
Ah, but some
of these weapons

44:17.121 --> 44:18.622
are quite ol
d, antique.

44:18.622 --> 44:20.624
,
BRIAN:
They still kill people

44:20.624 --> 44:22.626
nt.
and I presume
that's what you wa

44:22.626 --> 44:24.128
..
NIGERIAN:
I do not like jokes.

44:24.128 --> 44:26.630
(whispers):
Go get the car.
Here are the keys.

44:26.630 --> 44:28.632
in.
Because li
fe is uncerta

44:30.634 --> 44:31.635
f
BRIAN:
Fine, and I'm
speaking for mysel

44:32.136 --> 44:34.638
s.
which brings us, I
believe, back to busines

44:34.638 --> 44:36.140
sh?
Do you have the ca

44:43.147 --> 44:47.651
NIGERIAN:
We are prepared to offer you
very attractive terms.

44:49.653 --> 44:52.656
All right, it's half the money
now or no go.

44:54.158 --> 44:55.159
Be careful, you idiot!

44:55.159 --> 44:57.161
Those are grenades
you're playing with.

44:58.162 --> 45:00.164
MAN:
Now we must negotiate...

45:00.164 --> 45:02.666
MacGYVER:
Brother Brian wasn't
giving away any bargains.

45:02.666 --> 45:07.671
Some of this stuff probably
dated from the Boer War.

45:07.671 --> 45:10.674
The grenades still used
gun powder, which was a plus

45:11.175 --> 45:14.178
because I could use it
to lay a powder train,

45:14.178 --> 45:19.183
sort of an off-the-cuff,
on-the-floor type fuse.

45:19.183 --> 45:23.187
Light it, and it'd burn right
to the rest of the grenades...

45:23.187 --> 45:27.191
under a truck full of weapons.

45:44.208 --> 45:45.709
Grenade!

45:45.709 --> 45:47.711
Take cover!

45:47.711 --> 45:48.712
(explosion)

46:01.225 --> 46:02.726
Go!

46:03.727 --> 46:04.728
e!
Let's get out of her

46:04.728 --> 46:06.230
Looks like
it's going to blow!

46:09.233 --> 46:12.236
(loud explosions)

46:28.752 --> 46:30.754
Hit it!

46:32.256 --> 46:34.258
Oh!

46:37.261 --> 46:39.763
Watch your fingers there.

46:41.765 --> 46:43.267
(Sister Ann laughing)

46:43.267 --> 46:45.769
It's... it's wonderful.

46:45.769 --> 46:46.770
It's a marvel.

46:47.271 --> 46:48.772
Now how on earth will
we ever thank you?

46:49.273 --> 46:53.277
ou.
There's something that
we would like to ask y

46:53.277 --> 46:55.279
That you take this
off our hands.

46:55.279 --> 46:56.780
Oh, no, no, I can't accept this.

46:57.281 --> 46:59.283
It's too much.

46:59.283 --> 47:00.784
Well, we figure
you've got an awful lot

47:00.784 --> 47:01.785
of kids to feed and care for.

47:01.785 --> 47:04.288
And what bette
r use for money?

47:04.288 --> 47:06.790
But... MacGyver, how?

47:06.790 --> 47:07.791
Oh, I don't know.

47:07.791 --> 47:11.295
Call it a... small miracle.

47:13.797 --> 47:15.299
Oh...

47:15.299 --> 47:17.301
u.
thank yo
