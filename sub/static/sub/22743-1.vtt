You can make this happen.
You're Charlie Brenner.

02:42.664 --> 02:44.248
I think that's the problem.

02:44.249 --> 02:47.125
You are Charlie Brenner.
And who is she?

02:47.126 --> 02:50.545
Just another girl working at another
coffee shop making shit coffee.

02:50.546 --> 02:51.630
Shit coffee.

02:51.631 --> 02:53.925
Shit coffee. Shit coffee!

03:00.473 --> 03:01.723
Can I help you?

03:01.724 --> 03:03.101
Small coffee, please.

03:07.063 --> 03:09.147
Cream or sugar?

03:09.148 --> 03:12.151
Oh, that'd...
that'd be great. Both.

03:19.867 --> 03:20.910
Dollar fifty.

03:26.916 --> 03:27.917
Here. That's all right.

04:17.341 --> 04:19.510
Hey! Forgot your keys.

04:20.595 --> 04:21.596
Oh.

04:23.598 --> 04:24.849
- Thanks.
- No problem.

04:26.351 --> 04:28.310
Wait...

04:28.311 --> 04:30.063
Don't I have to prove
they're mine?

04:32.065 --> 04:34.900
What happens if I'm just saying
they're mine, but they're really not?

04:34.901 --> 04:37.861
I mean, they are my keys.
I'm not a thief or anything.

04:37.862 --> 04:40.322
I don't take other
people's keys, but I-I...

04:40.323 --> 04:43.284
I'm just saying that you
never know these days.

04:45.161 --> 04:46.286
Have a good day.

04:46.287 --> 04:48.080
What... what's your name?

04:48.081 --> 04:49.998
- Amber.
- Amber.

04:49.999 --> 04:51.000
I'm Charlie.

04:53.544 --> 04:57.130
Yeah, I don't mean to catch you
off guard or anything,

04:57.131 --> 05:00.675
but I just wanted to tell you that
I see you in here all the time

05:00.676 --> 05:02.844
when I come in
to get my coffees,

05:02.845 --> 05:06.264
which are really good,
and I just...

05:06.265 --> 05:07.975
yeah, I think you're really...

05:15.983 --> 05:18.194
You're really... something.

05:19.862 --> 05:20.862
Something?

05:21.906 --> 05:22.906
Something good.

05:25.034 --> 05:26.660
No, obviously, I...

05:26.661 --> 05:28.787
No, it's... I mean, you could
have said something worse.

05:28.788 --> 05:31.706
That's what I was thinking.
I wanted it to be...

05:33.042 --> 05:38.088
Yeah. Uh...
have a good day.

05:38.089 --> 05:41.050
Wait. These aren't
really my keys.

05:56.691 --> 05:57.817
It's... thanks.

06:06.075 --> 06:07.743
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

06:16.335 --> 06:17.711
Smells good.

06:17.712 --> 06:18.963
Mmm. Almost ready.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.224
What?

06:32.894 --> 06:35.187
Nothing.

06:35.188 --> 06:38.482
Isn't that that card game?
You don't need the cards.

06:38.483 --> 06:40.192
- Mom?
- Yes?

06:40.193 --> 06:41.903
Have you ever wished
anyone was dead?

06:43.154 --> 06:45.447
Dead?
No, honey, of course not.

06:45.448 --> 06:47.657
Why would you ask me that?

06:47.658 --> 06:49.201
Oh, Charlie! Charlie!

06:49.202 --> 06:51.328
I mean, really? Charlie!

06:51.329 --> 06:52.747
- I love you, Mom!
- Steven!

06:54.916 --> 06:57.667
Honey, why would you even
ask me something like that?

06:57.668 --> 06:59.228
'Cause I heard Dad
say it the other day.

07:00.463 --> 07:02.088
He overheard me
on a business call.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.256
Yeah?

07:03.257 --> 07:05.467
The kid's 10.
He knows I was joking.

07:05.468 --> 07:07.969
Yeah, next he'll run through the
house with six hand grenades.

07:07.970 --> 07:10.847
Well, he does, he does.
God forbid the boy follow his heart.

07:10.848 --> 07:15.602
Nice, Ross. Really. Classy.

07:15.603 --> 07:19.105
Oh, wow. Brilliant. Brilliant.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.983
- Oh! It hit the table! No! No!
- Oh. Hot potato, am I right?

07:21.984 --> 07:23.184
No!

07:26.906 --> 07:30.076
Charlie, are you depressed?

07:32.328 --> 07:36.414
You're crazy, Mom.
I'm fine.

07:36.415 --> 07:38.815
Have you thought anymore about
finishing up that application?

07:39.794 --> 07:41.086
That restaurant over on Vernon?

07:45.925 --> 07:49.637
I know, I know. Mind my own business.
I'm annoying.

07:53.474 --> 07:54.850
Your father called today.

07:56.769 --> 07:58.770
- What did he want?
- Who knows?

07:58.771 --> 08:00.815
I hung up before
he could launch into a speech.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.901
- Is he all right?
- I doubt it.

08:10.449 --> 08:11.825
That's Heather.

08:11.826 --> 08:14.202
- Oh, okay. I got it.
- You sure?

08:14.203 --> 08:16.621
- Yeah. Have fun.
- Yeah.

08:16.622 --> 08:18.707
- Thanks for making dinner.
- Yeah.

08:20.251 --> 08:23.295
Oh, please, please, please!
Oh! Oh! No, no, no!

08:23.296 --> 08:27.466
Oh, so nice, you guys.

08:36.642 --> 08:38.227
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:41.313 --> 08:42.731
Are you going to Brook's
tomorrow night?

08:42.732 --> 08:44.566
- Everyone's gonna be there.
- Oh, great.

08:44.567 --> 08:47.819
Maybe I can explain to everyone
individually that I still live at home

08:47.820 --> 08:49.696
when they're about to
run their own companies.

08:49.697 --> 08:51.281
Oh, come on, Charlie.

08:51.282 --> 08:53.533
They're still the same idiots
they always have been

08:53.534 --> 08:56.078
and always will be,
just fatter.

08:59.248 --> 09:01.207
- What is on your face?
- No touching.

09:01.208 --> 09:05.463
Okay, okay, sorry. Freak.
I was just getting a crumb off.

09:07.506 --> 09:10.008
Come on, you should go tomorrow.
Ben's gonna be there.

09:10.009 --> 09:12.636
Oh, is Ben my lover?

09:12.637 --> 09:14.095
You say that as if he isn't.

09:18.934 --> 09:20.186
Think I could bring somebody?

09:21.604 --> 09:23.856
Yeah, you can bring me. Duh.

09:25.691 --> 09:27.859
Who else would you bring?

09:29.528 --> 09:31.571
♪ Well, I will rock you
in the cradle ♪

09:31.572 --> 09:34.492
♪ Till you scream for more, baby ♪

09:37.244 --> 09:39.579
♪ Tell me what you waiting for ♪

09:42.416 --> 09:46.586
Hey. Did Brad call?
My phone died.

09:46.587 --> 09:50.382
Uh, maybe. I haven't been
picking up the phone.

09:50.383 --> 09:52.801
- Why not?
- 'Cause I'm testing myself

09:52.802 --> 09:54.969
to see how long I can go
without modern appliances.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.263
Like a caveman.

09:58.766 --> 09:59.766
You're watching TV.

10:01.644 --> 10:02.686
I am.

10:04.480 --> 10:06.940
- Are you drunk?
- Yup!

10:10.403 --> 10:12.196
Move please.

10:13.531 --> 10:14.740
Thank you.

10:16.242 --> 10:19.036
Yoo-hoo! I'm home!

10:42.977 --> 10:44.978
How was your meet today?

10:44.979 --> 10:47.313
After Brad finished the 100
meter I thought we were screwed

10:47.314 --> 10:49.149
but then Adam Smith
won the 200,

10:49.150 --> 10:52.485
and Adam Bedilia came in second
at 110, so we were fine.

10:52.486 --> 10:53.903
Adam Bedilia?

10:53.904 --> 10:57.699
Yeah, he's short.
Kind of skinny, I guess.

10:57.700 --> 11:00.201
Hmm. I thought that
was Adam Small.

11:00.202 --> 11:03.288
No, Adam Small is small
but Adam Bedilia is short.

11:03.289 --> 11:05.248
Okay.

11:05.249 --> 11:07.876
I spilled a whole pot of tea at work today.
It was everywhere.

11:07.877 --> 11:10.044
Are you okay? You didn't
burn yourself, right?

11:10.045 --> 11:12.130
No, I'm fine. It was just
really embarrassing.

11:12.131 --> 11:13.882
Oh, there's Adam Green too,
come to think of it

11:13.883 --> 11:16.801
but he's a freshman so it's
like a whole other story.

11:16.802 --> 11:19.679
I'm pretty sure his dad's a booster
and bought him a spot on the team.

11:19.680 --> 11:20.681
- Right.
- He's so slow.

11:23.976 --> 11:25.393
- Hey, sorry we're late.
- Hey!

11:25.394 --> 11:26.978
- Hey, how are you? Good?
- Good. How are you?

11:26.979 --> 11:28.062
Good. What's up, my man?

11:28.063 --> 11:29.773
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:29.774 --> 11:31.357
- Hi!
- Hi. How are you?

11:31.358 --> 11:32.400
Good.

11:32.401 --> 11:33.985
How was your day?

11:33.986 --> 11:36.739
Good! I got my
orientation stuff today.

11:37.865 --> 11:38.948
Aw.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.742
It's our last few
weeks together.

11:40.743 --> 11:42.660
- Really makes me sad.
- I know.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.871
But we'll still see
each other during breaks.

11:44.872 --> 11:48.209
Yeah, I know. But do you
think we'll still be us?

11:49.502 --> 11:50.960
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

11:50.961 --> 11:52.462
I've just been
thinking a lot lately

11:52.463 --> 11:55.048
about how much
we're gonna change

11:55.049 --> 11:58.218
and I just hope that my future
self still likes your future self.

11:58.219 --> 12:00.929
Okay, well, don't think
about that stuff.

12:00.930 --> 12:02.514
We still have some time.

12:02.515 --> 12:03.973
Yeah, and then
the next thing you know

12:03.974 --> 12:05.414
you're a grandmother
and you're dead.

12:07.770 --> 12:11.273
I don't know. I was kind of hoping
there was something in between.

12:13.150 --> 12:14.590
Well, there's always
track and field.

12:17.613 --> 12:19.782
Mm.

12:22.159 --> 12:23.827
Just come out and ask her, man.

12:23.828 --> 12:25.161
She just serves coffee.

12:25.162 --> 12:28.081
- Shitty coffee at that.
- Terrible coffee.

12:28.082 --> 12:30.291
- It's awful. The worst.
- Yech. She doesn't even deserve

12:30.292 --> 12:32.919
to talk to me after serving
coffee that horrendous.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.000
She deserves to die for it.

12:37.716 --> 12:39.051
Oh, hi.

12:40.553 --> 12:41.553
Hi.

12:42.888 --> 12:45.682
Last time I was in here
you were mopping too.

12:45.683 --> 12:47.850
Actually, I was sweeping.

12:47.851 --> 12:49.936
That's right. Yeah, sweeping.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.697
Yeah, you were sweeping,
come to think of it.

12:56.610 --> 13:00.531
Hey, listen, I didn't mean to weird you
out or anything a couple of days ago.

13:01.740 --> 13:02.740
It's fine.

13:06.537 --> 13:09.123
You from... where are you...
where are you from?

13:10.207 --> 13:12.750
- From here.
- Oh, yeah? Me too.

13:12.751 --> 13:13.960
Oh, nice.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.712
You in school, or...

13:15.713 --> 13:19.257
Uh, well, I'm going to
college in the fall.

13:19.258 --> 13:20.758
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, I'm going to NYU.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.970
That's a good one.
I've heard of that.

13:24.638 --> 13:29.058
Uh, New York University.
Listen, I was just...

13:29.059 --> 13:30.894
Okay, have a nice day!

13:34.648 --> 13:37.276
So? She's coming
to the party, right?

13:40.279 --> 13:41.279
Eh, whatever.

13:43.532 --> 13:48.286
You know, she served me this latte
last week... it just was gross.

13:48.287 --> 13:49.767
- Can we just get out of here?
- Yeah.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.250
For here or to go?

13:54.251 --> 13:55.419
To go.

14:00.591 --> 14:01.717
What was that all about?

14:03.218 --> 14:04.218
Just some guy.

14:05.554 --> 14:08.389
You don't hide from
just some guy, so...

14:08.390 --> 14:10.642
I have a boyfriend, so...

14:10.643 --> 14:14.228
So it's not cheating just
to talk to the poor bastard.

14:14.229 --> 14:17.148
Was I being mean?
I'm sorry, I'm just...

14:17.149 --> 14:19.984
I don't know. I'm not really
good with stuff like that.

14:19.985 --> 14:22.363
Stuff like what? Being nice?

14:24.573 --> 14:26.074
Thank you, sir.

14:26.075 --> 14:28.701
I hope you enjoy your beverage,
and have a wonderful day.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.371
Yeah. Whatever.

14:32.164 --> 14:33.832
You see? Nice.

14:38.337 --> 14:42.090
Okay. Listen. Stop.

14:42.091 --> 14:44.008
- Baby.
- Hey, can you get that?

14:56.230 --> 14:57.897
Yeah!

14:57.898 --> 14:59.649
How's it going, Jack?

14:59.650 --> 15:00.776
It's going.

15:04.154 --> 15:05.988
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:05.989 --> 15:07.908
Be gentle. I'm queasy again.

15:09.702 --> 15:11.786
Hey, do you mind if we go to
that new Italian place tonight?

15:11.787 --> 15:13.496
I gotta get my carbs in
for tomorrow.

15:13.497 --> 15:16.749
Well, I thought we were going to
Amanda's sister's thing tonight.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.585
No, I can't.
I have to run tomorrow.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.226
I don't know. I was
excited about tonight.

15:23.882 --> 15:24.925
Come on. Don't be selfish.

15:29.805 --> 15:32.098
Hey, we're going to some
party if you wanna come with us.

15:32.099 --> 15:34.100
He doesn't wanna go.

15:34.101 --> 15:36.269
Says who?

15:36.270 --> 15:39.355
Okay, the address is on my desk,
but it's not your type of thing.

15:39.356 --> 15:40.898
I'll be the judge of that.

15:40.899 --> 15:42.150
Great.

15:42.151 --> 15:43.192
See ya.

15:46.155 --> 15:47.989
Tell me what to do.

16:09.845 --> 16:13.015
Ooh, somebody's smoking.
Here, just keep going straight.

16:16.018 --> 16:18.854
Can you hold it? Thanks!

16:30.115 --> 16:31.741
What's wrong with you?

16:31.742 --> 16:32.742
What? Nothing.

16:33.786 --> 16:35.578
No, something's
definitely wrong.

16:35.579 --> 16:37.497
I told you you shouldn't
have had that second burger.

16:37.498 --> 16:39.916
- You're literally sweating.
- Are you gonna come watch me run tomorrow?

16:39.917 --> 16:41.459
- Or are you at the coffee shop?
- I'll come.

16:41.460 --> 16:43.503
What happened with that girl
from the coffee shop?

16:43.504 --> 16:45.963
I don't know what
you're talking about.

16:45.964 --> 16:48.800
The one you were
practically stalking.

16:48.801 --> 16:51.511
Ben said he waited for like an hour for
you to finally say something to her

16:51.512 --> 16:54.013
and you totally pussed out.

16:54.014 --> 16:57.059
I really, really, really don't
wanna talk about this right now.

16:58.560 --> 16:59.936
What's wrong with you?

16:59.937 --> 17:02.104
Nothing. I'm just...

17:02.105 --> 17:04.305
just trying to concentrate
on giving myself an aneurysm.

17:09.238 --> 17:10.320
You're so weird.

17:10.321 --> 17:11.531
- You okay?
- I'm fine, yeah.

17:18.539 --> 17:20.705
♪ It starts right now ♪

17:20.707 --> 17:24.752
♪ Just the way I was before ♪

17:24.752 --> 17:29.215
♪ But I can't recall
most of those days at all ♪

17:29.216 --> 17:32.468
- Excuse me. You are sexy.
- Thank you.

17:32.469 --> 17:35.513
- What's your name?
- Thank you.

17:35.514 --> 17:37.765
Oh, you're sexy.
No, you are sexy.

17:37.766 --> 17:39.976
- Hey, what's up, Todd?
- Oh, same ol', same ol'.

17:39.977 --> 17:41.727
Just another chapter
in the book

17:41.728 --> 17:46.357
I like to refer to as the endless
pursuit of sweet, sweet ass.

17:46.358 --> 17:48.609
You live a menial
existence, my friend.

17:48.610 --> 17:51.405
You have no idea.
No idea, buddy.

17:54.324 --> 17:56.200
I'll be right back.

17:56.201 --> 17:59.078
Ladies, the Todd is here,
have no fear.

17:59.079 --> 18:01.038
I know we do duets, right?

18:01.039 --> 18:02.123
- Hi!
- Hey!

18:02.124 --> 18:04.083
Together at last.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.751
- How you doing?
- How are you, Ben?

18:05.752 --> 18:09.213
- Jazzin'. What's up?
- Well...

18:09.214 --> 18:12.174
- Is that who I think it is?
- Yeah. Don't ask.

18:12.175 --> 18:14.510
That guy's one of the fastest
runners on the college circuit.

18:14.511 --> 18:15.761
Who?

18:15.762 --> 18:19.223
What do you mean who?
That's Brad Parker.

18:19.224 --> 18:22.519
Are you blind? Look who's coming
out right there behind him.

18:25.814 --> 18:30.402
Oh, man. You need a drink.

18:36.783 --> 18:37.784
Hi.

18:40.412 --> 18:42.038
What was your name again?

18:42.039 --> 18:44.081
- Uh, Charlie.
- Charlie.

18:44.082 --> 18:45.375
I'm Amber.

18:46.585 --> 18:48.336
I know. I know.

18:48.337 --> 18:51.881
Well, I just wanted to say hello
after what happened back there.

18:51.882 --> 18:53.883
Oh, you didn't have to.

18:53.884 --> 18:55.676
You should've told me that
two minutes ago.

18:55.677 --> 18:57.803
You would've saved me
the walk across the roof.

19:03.435 --> 19:05.020
So is that your boyfriend?

19:06.188 --> 19:07.480
Mm-hmm.

19:07.481 --> 19:10.775
Isn't he some big fast runner
or something?

19:10.776 --> 19:12.902
A big track star?

19:12.903 --> 19:16.907
Yeah, but don't tell him that.
He won't be able to fit his head through the door.

19:18.241 --> 19:20.869
How about you?
You with that girl?

19:22.579 --> 19:24.581
Heather? No, just friends.

19:25.707 --> 19:29.085
Our mothers met in Lamaze class.

19:29.086 --> 19:31.213
It was one of those
eternal damnation type deals.

19:32.506 --> 19:36.425
Yep. Shoot.

19:36.426 --> 19:37.426
What?

19:42.224 --> 19:44.308
Check this place out.

19:44.309 --> 19:46.894
Yeah, Charlie, this is
my cousin, Jeff.

19:46.895 --> 19:47.895
Hey, nice to meet you.

19:49.147 --> 19:52.942
Holy shit. It's the popcorn man.

19:52.943 --> 19:54.735
He works at the
movie theater on Doffin.

19:54.736 --> 19:57.988
He gives me a hard time when I go
in to play the Candy Crane machine.

19:57.989 --> 20:02.243
We have a policy at the theater about
people who refuse to buy tickets.

20:02.244 --> 20:04.036
- Wait, the Revival Theater?
- Uh-huh.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.163
- You work there?
- Yeah.

20:06.581 --> 20:08.332
You should get a job there.

20:08.333 --> 20:09.959
Don't tell me. He's the manager.

20:09.960 --> 20:14.004
No, I'm only assistant manager
so not really. I can't...

20:14.005 --> 20:18.300
I can't, uh...
yeah.

20:18.301 --> 20:22.264
Yeah, you should... okay, come in
this week and I'll see what I can do.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.768
- Deal.
- Deal.

20:27.769 --> 20:29.603
- That's a deal.
- It is. A deal.

20:29.604 --> 20:30.604
- Deal.
- Deal.

20:31.690 --> 20:32.690
Excuse me!

20:33.817 --> 20:34.984
- No, no, no.
- Shh!

20:34.985 --> 20:38.821
- Okay.
- You are sexy.

20:38.822 --> 20:40.531
You are drunk.

20:40.532 --> 20:41.782
I'm not.

20:41.783 --> 20:43.492
Hey, Todd, come here.

20:43.493 --> 20:44.994
- So, uh...
- Hey, Todd!

20:44.995 --> 20:47.079
You didn't finish telling me
about that thing earlier.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.582
- What thing?
- The surgical procedure

20:49.583 --> 20:52.084
that was really important.
Come on.

20:52.085 --> 20:55.880
- So...
- Hey, can we head out please? It's getting kind of late.

20:55.881 --> 20:57.673
Hey, Brad, this is Charlie.

20:57.674 --> 20:59.154
- Hey, what's going on, Charlie?
- Hi.

21:00.427 --> 21:01.511
You're that guy.

21:02.804 --> 21:03.804
What guy?

21:09.060 --> 21:11.645
- Oh, gross. Who barfed?
- That dude!

21:11.646 --> 21:14.273
This guy did it, right?
Everybody, it was him.

21:14.274 --> 21:15.524
You wanna clean that up, man.

21:15.525 --> 21:17.109
- Come on. Sorry!
- Clean that up!

21:17.110 --> 21:18.320
Party foul, man.

21:19.529 --> 21:22.406
- Can we go now? Can we go?
- Yeah. Yeah.

21:22.407 --> 21:23.658
Here you go.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.453
- I got ya.
- Yeah.

21:27.913 --> 21:28.913
Put him in the back.

21:30.749 --> 21:33.083
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

21:33.084 --> 21:36.045
- I appreciate it.
- We're gonna go in the car now.

21:36.046 --> 21:37.297
- Watch the head.
- Watch his...

21:39.132 --> 21:40.633
- Thanks for your help.
- Yeah, no worries.

21:40.634 --> 21:41.801
Make sure he gets some water.

21:41.802 --> 21:43.552
- Don't throw up.
- Oh god.

21:43.553 --> 21:46.096
Oh, how are your shoes?

21:46.097 --> 21:49.016
Well, ironically enough, I asked
for the vomit-covered model

21:49.017 --> 21:51.685
when I bought them,
but they were all sold out.

21:51.686 --> 21:53.229
- Ah.
- Yeah.

21:53.230 --> 21:54.950
Come on, honey.
I've really gotta go.

21:57.859 --> 21:59.361
- I'll see you. Okay.
- I'll see you.

22:01.154 --> 22:03.490
- You look so happy!
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

22:09.037 --> 22:11.413
- Ah, it could've been worse.
- Not really.

22:11.414 --> 22:13.916
You assholes.
I thought you left me.

22:13.917 --> 22:15.918
Almost! Almost got away clean.

22:15.919 --> 22:18.546
Hey, Charlie, who was that
cute girl you were talking to?

22:18.547 --> 22:20.173
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

22:21.800 --> 22:25.178
What? What did I say?

22:34.229 --> 22:35.355
Thanks.

22:40.193 --> 22:41.193
Enjoy.

22:43.530 --> 22:44.530
One cheeseburger.

22:46.366 --> 22:48.742
- How's your mother?
- Fine.

22:48.743 --> 22:50.452
And you? Still cooking?

22:50.453 --> 22:52.663
Mmm. Here and there.

22:52.664 --> 22:54.499
My little boy.
The four-star chef.

22:57.711 --> 22:59.951
Are you depressed, Charles?
You don't seem like yourself.

23:01.548 --> 23:05.509
What are you talking about?
You haven't even seen me in two years.

23:05.510 --> 23:06.803
Two years isn't so long.

23:08.430 --> 23:09.805
You're still working
in this shit hole.

23:09.806 --> 23:11.390
You know what you need?
You need a career.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.684
- You need a career.
- I have a career.

23:13.685 --> 23:15.185
Private detective.

23:15.186 --> 23:17.146
- You're a private detective?
- Private detective.

23:18.523 --> 23:20.024
I really think
it's my true calling.

23:20.025 --> 23:21.859
I haven't gotten
hired yet or anything

23:21.860 --> 23:23.695
but the whole thing
just feels right.

23:24.821 --> 23:26.031
I've been a fast learner.

23:28.074 --> 23:29.575
So how long you in town for?

23:29.576 --> 23:31.827
Huh? A couple days.
A week or two at the most.

23:31.828 --> 23:35.289
You know, I'm staying at the
Bryson's Motel off Highway 65

23:35.290 --> 23:41.712
and I was just wondering... maybe I could
stay with you. Think your mother would mind?

23:41.713 --> 23:43.297
I'm a little short
on cash right now.

23:43.298 --> 23:44.715
There's no way.

23:44.716 --> 23:48.261
Charlie, I'm your dad.
Talk to her.

23:49.346 --> 23:50.679
There's no way.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.306
Just talk to her.

23:52.307 --> 23:54.350
There's no way!

23:54.351 --> 23:56.226
He said it was only
gonna be a few days.

23:56.227 --> 23:58.980
That's what he said thirty years
ago and I ended up married to him!

24:00.065 --> 24:01.607
He could stay in my room.

24:01.608 --> 24:04.026
Charlie, no.

24:04.027 --> 24:05.987
Mom. Please.

24:24.089 --> 24:26.174
- Ah, look at that. You still got it.
- Yeah.

24:27.425 --> 24:28.945
Let me see that.
Bring it on over here.

24:33.723 --> 24:35.350
Ninety-five.

24:38.019 --> 24:40.437
Last time Orlando
won the series.

24:40.438 --> 24:42.356
Remember when
I got that for you?

24:42.357 --> 24:45.275
I'm gonna go sleep
on the couch downstairs.

24:45.276 --> 24:47.027
No, stay with me up here!

24:47.028 --> 24:48.612
Too crowded.

24:48.613 --> 24:50.293
If three's company,
how can two be a crowd?

24:54.703 --> 24:57.121
Your mother mad?

24:57.122 --> 24:59.915
Just try and stay out of her way.
She'll get over it.

24:59.916 --> 25:01.333
Okay.

25:01.334 --> 25:02.774
Wouldn't be the first time.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.103
It smells like donkey here.

25:26.526 --> 25:27.526
You didn't have to come.

25:38.413 --> 25:39.748
Is that that girl again?

25:43.376 --> 25:45.878
Oh, my God, you're sick. You're sick!
I'm gonna call the police!

25:45.879 --> 25:47.963
Yeah, well, good.
At least in jail

25:47.964 --> 25:50.424
I won't have to hear your voice ringing
in my head every three seconds.

25:50.425 --> 25:52.217
Why don't you just go
and say hello?

25:52.218 --> 25:53.552
I would feel creepy.

25:53.553 --> 25:54.845
You are!

25:54.846 --> 25:56.264
I'm not! I'm...

25:59.267 --> 26:01.186
Jesus, what's your problem?

26:02.729 --> 26:04.313
Just messing with you.

26:04.314 --> 26:05.522
You should go and talk to her.

26:05.523 --> 26:07.608
You're like the greatest
guy ever, Charles.

26:07.609 --> 26:10.360
She has a boyfriend who is a track star.

26:10.361 --> 26:11.738
Oh, whatever.

26:15.241 --> 26:16.242
Damn.

26:18.411 --> 26:19.704
That is fast.

26:25.502 --> 26:26.669
Ooh.

26:27.837 --> 26:29.671
- You all right?
- Mmm.

26:29.672 --> 26:31.924
Yeah, it's my stomach again.

26:31.925 --> 26:33.383
Maybe you're pregnant.

26:33.384 --> 26:34.843
I'm not pregnant!

26:34.844 --> 26:36.345
How do you know?

26:36.346 --> 26:37.346
Because I'm careful.

26:38.598 --> 26:41.309
God, can you imagine?
Brad would kill himself.

26:43.520 --> 26:45.688
There's a sign you're in
a healthy relationship.

26:49.734 --> 26:51.528
Hey. What's up?

26:53.696 --> 26:54.696
Nothing.

26:55.824 --> 26:58.700
I just wanted to stop by
and say hello.

26:58.701 --> 27:00.036
I was in the neighborhood, so...

27:01.371 --> 27:03.539
Okay. Yeah, I'm really
busy right now.

27:03.540 --> 27:05.792
It's getting
really hectic, so...

27:07.085 --> 27:08.127
Mmm.

27:11.339 --> 27:13.341
- Right.
- Yeah.

27:15.093 --> 27:16.093
See you later.

27:17.178 --> 27:18.595
Okay.

27:18.596 --> 27:19.716
Take care.

27:22.183 --> 27:25.186
Now that wasn't
too awkward or anything.

27:26.396 --> 27:28.314
I want a shower
just witnessing that.

27:36.114 --> 27:37.114
Charlie!

27:38.575 --> 27:40.993
Hey, I get off
at 6:00 tomorrow.

27:40.994 --> 27:43.161
I'm gonna meet
a friend downtown,

27:43.162 --> 27:47.500
but maybe you wanna walk me there?
If you're in the neighborhood?

27:51.212 --> 27:52.296
Yeah.

28:04.392 --> 28:05.392
You're the man.

28:07.145 --> 28:09.188
Oh, yeah.
People like you.

28:10.565 --> 28:14.443
Girls like you.
Girls like you.

28:14.444 --> 28:15.861
And they would if you
knew more of them,

28:15.862 --> 28:17.702
but you live with your parents.
You're a loser.

28:20.116 --> 28:22.744
No. Come on!

28:23.912 --> 28:25.121
Come on, Charles!

28:26.539 --> 28:28.290
You're a good, humble guy.

28:28.291 --> 28:30.542
Admitting you're humble while
staring at yourself in the mirror

28:30.543 --> 28:32.336
is probably the least
humble thing you can do

28:32.337 --> 28:36.340
but you just gotta relax. Relax!

28:36.341 --> 28:38.009
You live a completely
normal life.

28:39.844 --> 28:41.484
You just gotta have
a little bit of pride.

28:42.722 --> 28:44.849
Have some pride.
Have some pride.

28:47.518 --> 28:51.189
Have some...
have some...

28:53.483 --> 28:55.442
Have some pride!

28:55.443 --> 29:00.448
Oh, hey, hon. Sorry.
Forgot my towel on the bed.

29:16.881 --> 29:21.301
I walk almost everywhere.
Helps me think.

29:21.302 --> 29:23.720
What do you think about?

29:23.721 --> 29:26.391
I guess I think about all I could
get done if I stopped thinking.

29:28.059 --> 29:30.060
- Oh.
- What?

29:30.061 --> 29:31.728
No, that's original.

29:31.729 --> 29:35.232
I mean, even if it is annoyingly
self-defeating. No offense.

29:35.233 --> 29:38.735
But, no, I just thought you
were gonna pull out some crap

29:38.736 --> 29:42.572
about how all you think about
are cute animals or world peace.

29:42.573 --> 29:43.657
Or something like that.

29:43.658 --> 29:45.200
Oh, you mean you
didn't catch that?

29:45.201 --> 29:47.744
That little pretentious bit
was supposed to be a metaphor

29:47.745 --> 29:49.913
for how much
I like cute animals.

29:49.914 --> 29:51.354
- And world peace.
- And world peace.

29:52.917 --> 29:55.919
In fact, I want world
peace for all animals.

29:55.920 --> 29:58.588
And I'm doing this Noah's Ark project
next month if you wanna help.

29:58.589 --> 30:01.717
It should only take 40 days
and 40 nights or so.

30:01.718 --> 30:04.553
Right. After 40,
your ark's built, no?

30:04.554 --> 30:06.347
Or 80, yeah, but who's counting?

30:08.266 --> 30:09.906
I'm not counting.

30:17.608 --> 30:19.067
You been here before?

30:19.068 --> 30:20.653
Yeah. Yeah, a few times.

30:24.031 --> 30:26.617
When I was a kid it was my dream
to have my own restaurant.

30:27.869 --> 30:28.869
Not anymore?

30:30.788 --> 30:32.622
Uh, I don't know.

30:32.623 --> 30:33.915
Can you cook?

30:33.916 --> 30:35.668
Uh... that's what they tell me.

30:40.131 --> 30:42.758
I wish I could cook.
I can't even make cereal.

30:42.759 --> 30:44.886
- Or coffee.
- Asshole.

30:47.263 --> 30:51.392
Wait. So how come you work at a movie
theater instead of a restaurant?

30:54.312 --> 30:55.937
Sensitive subject?

30:55.938 --> 30:58.775
No, not really. I just...

30:59.942 --> 31:01.444
I don't have all
the answers yet.

31:05.698 --> 31:07.115
Where do you live?

31:07.116 --> 31:08.241
I live off Charles Street.

31:08.242 --> 31:10.577
- Oh, yeah.
- With my cousin. Yeah.

31:10.578 --> 31:16.875
Well, my family's in Florida. They moved
last year because of my dad's work,

31:16.876 --> 31:19.461
but I decided to stay here
so I could finish high school,

31:19.462 --> 31:21.297
and I could also stay with Brad.

31:22.757 --> 31:24.037
How long have you been together?

31:25.384 --> 31:28.261
Almost four years. Yeah.

31:28.262 --> 31:31.348
Now that I think of it, I don't think
I've been single since grade school.

31:31.349 --> 31:32.350
It doesn't surprise me.

31:34.852 --> 31:36.812
You know what's
strange about you?

31:36.813 --> 31:39.689
On one hand,
you're painfully shy

31:39.690 --> 31:44.110
and on the other hand, you say these things
that I don't think I could ever say.

31:44.111 --> 31:47.239
- Things like what?
- Like what you just said.

31:47.240 --> 31:49.742
I mean, it's not a bad thing.
You're just different.

31:50.910 --> 31:52.118
Different.

31:52.119 --> 31:53.411
You know what I mean.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.252
Different. No, I can live
with that. Different.

31:57.124 --> 31:58.124
Different.

32:01.838 --> 32:04.507
I'm gonna say... maybe.

32:05.591 --> 32:07.301
Maybe. Yeah.

32:09.804 --> 32:11.680
Well.

32:11.681 --> 32:14.307
This is it. Thanks for the walk.

32:14.308 --> 32:15.560
Oh, no, no. Anytime.

32:17.061 --> 32:20.106
Would it be out of line
to ask for your number?

32:23.025 --> 32:24.318
How about you give me yours?

32:33.411 --> 32:34.578
Here you go.

32:34.579 --> 32:38.164
Okay. Cool. I had fun today.

32:38.165 --> 32:40.293
Yeah, me too.
We should do it again.

32:41.711 --> 32:43.296
Yeah, um...

32:46.007 --> 32:50.260
Okay, I don't know how to say this
without sounding like an ass, but...

32:50.261 --> 32:56.349
Oh, no. You have a boyfriend who you love,
and we are only gonna be friends. I get it.

32:56.350 --> 32:59.019
There's no expectations.

32:59.020 --> 33:00.271
- Sweet. Okay.
- Really.

33:01.522 --> 33:02.690
I'll call you.

33:10.531 --> 33:11.615
Hey.

33:11.616 --> 33:14.075
Who was that?

33:14.076 --> 33:17.496
Oh, just a regular. We were both
walking in the same direction.

33:18.956 --> 33:20.582
He's kind of cute.

33:20.583 --> 33:23.376
- You think?
- Yeah, kind of.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.887
Oh, this is a bold
choice right there.

33:33.888 --> 33:36.264
Do you have any truffle salt?

33:36.265 --> 33:37.433
I'm going out for a bit.

33:39.226 --> 33:41.102
What are you staring at?

33:41.103 --> 33:45.358
I'm sorry. Looking at you
makes me feel young again.

33:49.153 --> 33:51.363
- How long are you staying for?
- Just a little while.

33:51.364 --> 33:54.324
I made arrangements to be out during the day,
so I won't get in your way.

33:54.325 --> 33:56.077
- Good. Bye, honey.
- Bye.

33:59.330 --> 34:00.705
Won't even look at me.

34:00.706 --> 34:01.791
Just give her a break.

34:18.474 --> 34:19.474
One, please.

34:21.268 --> 34:22.311
Application, that is.

34:24.063 --> 34:27.607
Nine-fifteen, ten-fifteen.

34:27.608 --> 34:30.485
This guy can't seem to hold a
job for more than two months.

34:30.485 --> 34:32.737
Just give him a chance.
I'll vouch for him.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.781
You owe him a favor?

34:34.782 --> 34:37.534
No, just one of those things.

34:39.578 --> 34:43.331
Cryptic. You'll train him?

34:51.465 --> 34:55.969
All right you little prick.
Our journey ends here.

34:55.969 --> 34:58.723
Today, your ass is mine.

35:02.768 --> 35:07.023
- Hey!
- Shit! What?

35:08.482 --> 35:09.650
You want the job or not?

35:16.282 --> 35:17.657
All right.

35:17.658 --> 35:20.870
So, popcorn. Easy, huh?

35:23.706 --> 35:28.793
But if they want butter, you give two
squirts in the middle, three on top.

35:28.794 --> 35:31.921
Any more, and we have to
charge 20 cents extra.

35:31.922 --> 35:33.923
Did you know that emus
are the only animals

35:33.924 --> 35:35.968
that willingly have sex
with humans when seduced?

35:38.846 --> 35:39.930
Think about that.

35:45.269 --> 35:47.396
- Are you thinking about it?
- No, not really.

36:04.997 --> 36:07.249
Think red, think red, think red.

36:40.699 --> 36:42.951
Hey, this is Brad. Sorry I
can't get to the phone right now.

36:43.994 --> 36:46.705
Hey. Hey, Brad, it's me. Amber.

36:48.582 --> 36:49.583
Give me a call.

36:58.509 --> 37:00.677
Hi, this is Leslie. I can't
get to the phone right now,

37:00.678 --> 37:02.846
so leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

37:04.723 --> 37:07.560
Hey, Leslie, it's Amber.
Call me.

37:38.674 --> 37:40.258
Amber, hey.

37:40.259 --> 37:41.385
How are you?

37:42.553 --> 37:45.848
I'm okay. Okay.

37:48.559 --> 37:50.977
What are you doing tonight?

37:50.978 --> 37:54.355
Tonight I'm...
just making some dinner and...

37:54.356 --> 37:57.943
You are? What are you eating?

38:00.279 --> 38:01.279
Um...

38:10.915 --> 38:13.249
So how do you two
know each other?

38:13.250 --> 38:14.585
- Oh...
- From my work.

38:15.836 --> 38:17.128
I work at a coffee shop.

38:17.129 --> 38:18.963
Oh, no kidding! Me too.

38:18.964 --> 38:20.465
When I was a kid
I worked at a coffee shop.

38:20.466 --> 38:21.799
Here we go.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.218
We were known as the best
cup of joe in Brooklyn.

38:24.219 --> 38:25.970
"You want good joe?
It's the place you gotta go."

38:25.971 --> 38:27.055
You grew up in Georgia.

38:27.056 --> 38:28.640
I know where I grew up.

38:28.641 --> 38:30.922
I'm just trying to spice up
the story a bit. Jesus Christ.

38:32.978 --> 38:35.355
- This is really good.
- Oh, thanks.

38:35.356 --> 38:36.814
Kid's a genius in the kitchen.

38:36.815 --> 38:37.815
Like you would know.

38:39.485 --> 38:41.903
Amber, let me show you
what Charlie won

38:41.904 --> 38:44.614
in a big state-wide cooking
competition a couple of years ago.

38:44.615 --> 38:48.326
It was city-wide. I didn't win.
I just came in second.

38:48.327 --> 38:49.327
Mom!

38:53.040 --> 38:55.500
Oh, wow!

38:55.501 --> 38:57.126
- How about it, huh?
- Yeah.

38:57.127 --> 38:59.629
It's got his name on it
and a medal.

38:59.630 --> 39:01.297
That's nice.

39:01.298 --> 39:04.592
And one of the judges, Trevor...

39:04.593 --> 39:06.177
- I forget his last name.
- Trevor Vanier.

39:06.178 --> 39:08.930
Well, he writes for this major
cooking magazine in New York.

39:08.931 --> 39:11.683
He came up to Charlie afterwards
and told him that he thought

39:11.684 --> 39:15.019
he was one of the most talented
amateur chefs he'd ever seen.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.188
- He gave me a medal.
- Yeah.

39:17.189 --> 39:18.732
- How about it?
- Yeah.

39:20.067 --> 39:21.818
And then what?

39:21.819 --> 39:25.988
Well, he gave Charles
his number.

39:25.989 --> 39:30.284
And said he was all ears
if he ever wanted to talk.

39:30.285 --> 39:33.371
But I never called. We know.
Thank you, Mom. I'm an asshole.

39:33.372 --> 39:34.372
Language!

39:37.793 --> 39:40.128
- Steven Jacobs!
- Put that down.

39:40.129 --> 39:41.463
You don't tell my son
what to do.

39:44.383 --> 39:46.050
Probably learned
the behavior from you.

39:46.051 --> 39:48.594
- What did you say?
- What? No, nothing.

39:48.595 --> 39:50.805
- Guys.
- Steven, put it down!

39:50.806 --> 39:52.640
Well, don't be so hard
on the kid. He's just a kid.

39:52.641 --> 39:54.081
You make the rules
in your own house!

39:55.185 --> 39:58.521
Steven, come on.
Give it to me.

39:58.522 --> 40:03.026
Hey. Not the lady.
Just take me.

40:06.530 --> 40:10.074
Oh, that's nice. Both of you.

40:10.075 --> 40:16.205
That's very nice. That was
Academy award-winning material.

40:16.206 --> 40:19.501
Amber, I'm sorry, sweetie.

40:21.879 --> 40:23.005
Come on.

40:35.642 --> 40:38.482
I'm really sorry about what happened in there.
That was so embarrassing.

40:42.775 --> 40:43.776
What is it?

40:49.198 --> 40:51.825
I can't believe I'm telling
you this. I hardly know you.

40:54.244 --> 40:55.454
Took a pregnancy test.

40:57.623 --> 40:59.208
It was negative, but...

41:00.876 --> 41:04.880
The whole idea of it made my
whole life flash before my eyes.

41:10.010 --> 41:12.553
You ever get nervous
about the future?

41:12.554 --> 41:13.555
Me?

41:15.641 --> 41:16.641
No.

41:18.435 --> 41:21.187
I have a great set-up.
I'm fifty-five years old.

41:21.188 --> 41:24.273
I work at a shitty movie theater,
and I live at home.

41:24.274 --> 41:27.276
Well, I don't understand why.

41:27.277 --> 41:30.739
You're so talented. I feel like you could
have a job at any restaurant you wanted.

41:35.994 --> 41:36.994
Oh.

41:39.164 --> 41:40.415
I'm glad I met you, Charlie.

41:48.173 --> 41:52.635
My friend is having a party
Tuesday if you wanna go.

41:52.636 --> 41:55.888
He just took the bar,
so it's a little celebration.

41:55.889 --> 42:00.810
Tuesday night. I'm hanging out with
my friend Leslie and Brad that night.

42:00.811 --> 42:03.312
- Well, you can bring them.
- Yeah?

42:03.313 --> 42:07.191
Yeah, even bring Jack
too if you want.

42:07.192 --> 42:09.735
I think I accidentally told him
about it anyway.

42:09.736 --> 42:12.655
Right! I totally forgot
you got him that job.

42:12.656 --> 42:13.907
It's no... no big deal.

42:14.992 --> 42:16.159
Well, thank you.

42:19.371 --> 42:23.457
Okay, so Tuesday.
It's a date.

42:23.458 --> 42:25.878
Right. Tuesday it is.

42:27.129 --> 42:28.505
- Okay.
- All right.

42:30.757 --> 42:33.009
- Do you need anything?
- No, I'm good.

42:33.010 --> 42:35.304
But come on in.
Sit down. Let's talk about it.

42:48.025 --> 42:49.692
What's with your
mother's husband?

42:49.693 --> 42:52.820
I don't wanna get into this with you.
Russ is a good guy.

42:52.821 --> 42:54.948
There's no reason
to get uptight about it.

42:58.243 --> 42:59.244
You know...

43:01.705 --> 43:03.456
How's your girlfriend?

43:03.457 --> 43:05.166
- Amber. She's just a friend.
- Amber.

43:05.167 --> 43:08.085
There's no need to keep things
from your old man.

43:08.086 --> 43:09.462
I saw the way
she was looking at you.

43:09.463 --> 43:11.590
- No, you didn't.
- Actually, yeah, I did.

43:13.550 --> 43:15.093
And it gets to my point.

43:17.220 --> 43:19.222
Maybe you have to be
more aggressive with her.

43:22.643 --> 43:25.144
Sometimes, no matter
how hard it is,

43:25.145 --> 43:27.481
you just gotta
step to the plate.

43:30.859 --> 43:32.444
That sounds like a bad t-shirt.

43:34.112 --> 43:35.447
Hey, hey, hey.

43:36.531 --> 43:37.823
What?

43:37.824 --> 43:39.868
I spoke with a gentleman
from New Orleans today.

43:41.745 --> 43:45.539
Looks like I booked
my first assignment.

43:45.540 --> 43:47.500
- Really?
- He's gonna put me up and everything.

43:47.501 --> 43:50.170
Your old man is staying
at the Riverview Plaza.

43:51.797 --> 43:54.049
Well, that's great.

43:55.842 --> 43:57.762
Thinks his wife is cheating
on him with his boss.

44:00.305 --> 44:02.098
Lot of screwed up
people out there.

44:02.099 --> 44:03.225
Like you?

44:07.854 --> 44:09.356
Life is complicated, Charles.

44:13.568 --> 44:15.696
Things aren't always as black
and white as they seem.

44:17.739 --> 44:19.907
And you of all people
should know that,

44:19.908 --> 44:22.535
especially after what
you been through.

44:22.536 --> 44:23.662
Night.

44:25.622 --> 44:26.622
Charlie...

44:29.126 --> 44:30.126
I love you.

44:35.173 --> 44:36.173
Love you too.

44:43.682 --> 44:45.516
- Thank you.
- Cheers, guys.

44:45.517 --> 44:47.560
Red wine doesn't even count.

44:47.561 --> 44:48.811
It's sophisticated.

44:48.812 --> 44:49.895
It is sophisticated.

44:49.896 --> 44:51.605
All the cool people...

44:51.606 --> 44:53.983
She's coming. Like this. It looks better.
She's coming in.

44:53.984 --> 44:57.445
- Hey.
- Hey.

44:57.446 --> 45:00.990
You've met Brad
and this is Leslie.

45:00.991 --> 45:02.491
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you, Leslie.

45:02.492 --> 45:05.620
I need a drink.
Hi, buddy, good to see ya.

45:06.913 --> 45:08.080
You guys want something?

45:08.081 --> 45:10.541
Just water's good. Thank you.

45:10.542 --> 45:12.168
Water?

45:12.169 --> 45:14.211
- How you doing? It's Brad.
- Heather.

45:14.212 --> 45:15.379
- Hi, I'm Leslie.
- Heather.

45:15.380 --> 45:16.715
Good to see you.

45:27.726 --> 45:28.726
You with the thing?

45:30.228 --> 45:32.229
- The party? Yeah.
- Yeah.

45:32.230 --> 45:33.606
I'm a friend of Charlie's.

45:33.607 --> 45:35.733
You know Charlie?
I know Charlie.

45:35.734 --> 45:38.694
I work at the movie
theater with him.

45:38.695 --> 45:41.197
I'm really into pop culture
and stuff, so it's cool. Yeah.

45:41.198 --> 45:43.616
It's a pretty cool gig.
You know, it's all right.

45:43.617 --> 45:44.993
- Cool.
- Yeah.

45:50.957 --> 45:52.792
You want a drink?

45:52.793 --> 45:55.253
Oh, don't worry
about it. I got it.

45:57.881 --> 46:00.591
Oh, cool. Whiskey on the rocks.

46:00.592 --> 46:04.054
No, I'm actually gonna
get myself one.

46:12.521 --> 46:13.772
Whiskey on the rocks.

46:16.483 --> 46:19.819
I just can't believe
that you're finally done.

46:19.820 --> 46:22.404
Don't jinx it. It's not like
I passed yet.

46:22.405 --> 46:26.618
But if I do, you should consider
coming to New York with me.

46:28.703 --> 46:31.455
It's not that easy to just
pick up and leave.

46:31.456 --> 46:33.916
Why? Are you the mayor?

46:33.917 --> 46:35.917
What do you have going on here
that's so important?

46:39.339 --> 46:41.800
You can't let fear of failure
run your life, man.

46:45.220 --> 46:47.347
That's got to say something good
about taking risks.

46:51.059 --> 46:55.355
It's funny. She's the only girl
I ever felt charming around.

46:57.399 --> 47:00.151
- You're not charming.
- That's the thing. I know.

47:12.581 --> 47:15.458
Sorry. I don't know
what I was thinking.

47:23.425 --> 47:24.425
Hello?

47:41.234 --> 47:43.110
This is kind of fun
for an old people party.

47:43.111 --> 47:44.112
Mm-hmm.

47:46.197 --> 47:49.366
Hey, I think that guy Charlie's
pretty nice, by the way.

47:49.367 --> 47:54.663
Yeah, he's nice but he's got
some serious problems.

47:54.664 --> 47:57.500
I mean, he means well
but he's just lost.

47:59.085 --> 48:01.420
Since when are
you so judgmental?

48:01.421 --> 48:03.589
I'm not. It's just...

48:03.590 --> 48:05.799
Okay, he wants to own
a restaurant or something,

48:05.800 --> 48:08.969
but he's so screwed up that
he won't even talk about it.

48:08.970 --> 48:10.763
And that's the thing.
He's a really good cook,

48:10.764 --> 48:12.057
but he won't take it seriously.

48:13.183 --> 48:14.184
It's sad.

48:17.812 --> 48:23.025
I don't know. I don't think I could ever
be with someone like that, you know?

48:23.026 --> 48:24.906
Well, lucky for
you it's not an option.

48:27.656 --> 48:28.656
Yeah.

Where you going?

50:28.651 --> 50:29.986
I'm picking up
my son from school

50:32.447 --> 50:34.781
- You want company?
- No.

50:34.782 --> 50:36.742
What do you say you
let me take you out

50:36.743 --> 50:39.286
to breakfast tomorrow to
thank you for letting me stay.

50:39.287 --> 50:41.079
I didn't let you stay.
If it were up to me,

50:41.080 --> 50:42.720
you wouldn't even be allowed
in the state.

50:44.834 --> 50:45.834
Yeah.

50:49.297 --> 50:51.466
Sam, I feel regret
every day for what I did.

50:55.512 --> 50:57.221
I've missed you for a long time.

50:57.222 --> 50:59.098
And I know you don't
believe me, but it's true.

51:03.102 --> 51:05.145
- We had some good times.
- Yeah, and then you cleared out

51:05.146 --> 51:07.105
my bank account and left me
alone with our son.

51:07.106 --> 51:09.816
And I always meant
to pay you back. Always.

51:09.817 --> 51:12.945
But things don't always pan out
the way you want them to.

51:12.946 --> 51:15.113
- Why did you come back here?
- I have a job waiting for me

51:15.114 --> 51:16.714
in New Orleans.
I wanted to see you guys.

51:19.452 --> 51:20.869
And I had nowhere else to stay.

51:20.870 --> 51:23.121
Yeah, that sounds more like it.

51:23.122 --> 51:26.708
Well, I got myself into
a bit of a pickle.

51:26.709 --> 51:28.461
I owe some people some money.

51:30.588 --> 51:32.798
Are you ever gonna grow up?

51:32.799 --> 51:34.551
I don't know. I'm trying.

51:36.928 --> 51:39.179
I want a fresh start.

51:39.180 --> 51:42.183
You broke my heart so badly,
I didn't think I was gonna be able to live.

51:43.268 --> 51:44.268
Did you know that?

51:45.895 --> 51:47.771
Yeah, I did.

51:47.772 --> 51:52.609
I get a letter or something every
couple of years for two decades,

51:52.610 --> 51:56.030
and then suddenly one day you show up like
you're a guest in some old friend's house?

51:59.367 --> 52:00.868
Please. I'm gonna be late.

52:09.460 --> 52:11.180
You're never gonna
forgive me, are you, Sam?

52:12.714 --> 52:15.008
I don't remember you even
asking for forgiveness.

52:16.175 --> 52:17.176
I'm asking you now.

52:37.196 --> 52:40.365
No, no! Come on!
I had you!

52:40.366 --> 52:42.784
I... I had him.

52:42.785 --> 52:46.163
- Had who?
- The white whale to my Captain Ahab.

52:46.164 --> 52:48.124
I had him and now he's gone.

52:49.500 --> 52:50.960
- Are you drunk?
- No!

52:54.255 --> 52:55.255
Yes.

53:00.219 --> 53:03.348
So what's the deal with your friend
Heather, man? She's pretty hot.

53:06.559 --> 53:07.726
You mind if I try
to move on in?

53:07.727 --> 53:09.269
Move on in?

53:09.270 --> 53:12.522
You trying to get a date or
infiltrate a foreign brigade?

53:12.523 --> 53:13.733
Shit, man, I'm just asking.

53:14.817 --> 53:15.985
You need to relax.

53:18.655 --> 53:20.447
What's with you?
You depressed?

53:20.448 --> 53:23.868
I'm fine, okay?
Thank you. Thank you.

53:26.663 --> 53:28.539
It's Amber, isn't it?

53:32.043 --> 53:33.294
It is, huh?

53:34.629 --> 53:36.838
Wanna know how I figured it out?

53:36.839 --> 53:40.467
'Cause you're the first person in a long
time who's gone out of their way for me.

53:40.468 --> 53:42.427
Being that I'm not
exactly Prince Charming,

53:42.428 --> 53:44.471
I'm gonna go ahead
and guess it's not about me,

53:44.472 --> 53:46.723
so my money's on Amber.

53:46.724 --> 53:49.017
You trying to impress
her or some shit.

53:49.018 --> 53:51.186
But the bitch of it is,
she's got a boyfriend

53:51.187 --> 53:54.564
who's in better shape, is better
looking, has a great future.

53:54.565 --> 53:56.165
You don't know what
you're talking about.

53:56.984 --> 53:58.104
All right, man, that's cool.

54:01.698 --> 54:02.823
You think he's better looking?

54:02.824 --> 54:04.783
Oh, yeah, I mean
look at the guy.

54:04.784 --> 54:07.285
He's got a square jaw, his dick
probably has a six-pack. I'd do him.

54:07.286 --> 54:10.539
Okay! All right.
Enough. Jesus.

54:10.540 --> 54:11.749
You asked.

54:13.668 --> 54:16.546
You missed a spot. Just there.

54:58.296 --> 54:59.296
How's it going?

55:01.340 --> 55:03.592
It's been a little while.
I've missed you.

55:03.593 --> 55:06.929
Yeah, I've just been busy.
Things are hectic around here.

55:11.184 --> 55:13.060
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

55:15.354 --> 55:19.609
I just heard you talking
in the bathroom at the bar.

55:21.277 --> 55:22.570
I heard what you said about me.

55:24.363 --> 55:26.123
- It's not what it seemed like.
- Yes, it is.

55:28.618 --> 55:29.827
But that's fine.

55:31.746 --> 55:33.831
It's how you feel.
I can handle it.

55:36.501 --> 55:40.420
I'm so sorry.
I don't blame you for being mad.

55:40.421 --> 55:41.881
I'm not mad. I'm embarrassed.

55:44.383 --> 55:48.012
And mad, obviously. I'm mad.

55:51.224 --> 55:54.059
I think you're really great.
That's why I said those things.

55:54.060 --> 55:55.769
Obviously.

55:55.770 --> 55:57.063
Don't be like that.

55:59.774 --> 56:04.236
What I was trying to say
is that I don't get you.

56:04.237 --> 56:06.822
I mean, you have so much
going for you. It's frustrating.

56:09.200 --> 56:13.954
You're smart and you're nice.
And you're cute. You're funny.

56:13.955 --> 56:14.955
I'm not funny.

56:17.416 --> 56:18.584
Well, maybe not on purpose.

56:20.586 --> 56:21.586
What?

56:40.523 --> 56:44.068
Oh, hey guys.
Towel. On the bed.

56:54.912 --> 56:56.037
That was a mistake.

56:56.038 --> 56:57.707
No, I know. I'm really sorry.

57:00.543 --> 57:02.002
- Okay.
- Okay.

57:02.003 --> 57:03.253
Okay. I'll talk to you soon.

57:03.254 --> 57:04.254
- Okay.
- Okay.

57:10.553 --> 57:13.556
I don't normally do this
type of thing, you know?

57:14.807 --> 57:18.644
No, I...
I don't usually either.

57:26.861 --> 57:27.987
I'm sorry I said that stuff.

57:33.451 --> 57:37.037
Did you ever go to
cooking school or anything?

57:37.038 --> 57:39.457
Oh, I went to college,
but I never finished.

57:40.875 --> 57:41.875
Why not?

57:46.797 --> 57:48.090
Why won't you talk to me?

57:57.808 --> 57:59.935
I was home for the summer
after my junior year.

58:01.979 --> 58:06.066
And Ben and I were on our
way back from some party.

58:06.067 --> 58:07.707
Don't remember what we
were talking about.

58:09.862 --> 58:10.988
This car...

58:12.948 --> 58:15.534
The headlights of this car
just came out of nowhere.

58:18.829 --> 58:20.206
What happened?
Were you drinking?

58:21.957 --> 58:22.957
No.

58:24.293 --> 58:27.088
No. The girl who was
driving the other car was.

58:28.464 --> 58:29.464
Julie Redding.

58:31.300 --> 58:34.386
She just ran the red light,

58:34.387 --> 58:37.723
and I tried to get out of the way
but I just couldn't react in time.

58:41.018 --> 58:42.018
Was she okay?

58:46.273 --> 58:47.273
It's...

58:50.111 --> 58:52.278
It's amazing.

58:52.279 --> 58:55.657
People say these things
happen so fast and they do.

58:55.658 --> 58:57.951
One second you're living
your life and the next...

58:57.952 --> 59:01.955
nothing's the same. I don't even
remember myself before that.

59:01.956 --> 59:04.624
Not really.

59:04.625 --> 59:07.345
Think about myself back then,
it's like thinking about somebody else.

59:15.261 --> 59:20.306
I tried to go back to school,
but I was all screwed up,

59:20.307 --> 59:23.643
so I came home. And I was only
supposed to be here for a minute,

59:23.644 --> 59:28.190
but one day became a week,
week became a month, a month became...

59:31.569 --> 59:34.738
Yeah, it was the devil's deal.

59:34.739 --> 59:39.535
I could have eternal comfort, but I had
to trade in all my drive. And I took it.

59:43.581 --> 59:47.041
- It's not true.
- It is true. It is.

59:47.042 --> 59:48.335
But it's okay.

59:51.797 --> 59:54.675
You were right about me.
I'm scared.

59:57.011 --> 59:58.137
I'm scared.

59:59.889 --> 01:00:03.516
You don't think I see what's
happening all around me?

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:06.728
Don't think I see the world
moving forward every day?

01:00:06.729 --> 01:00:09.189
I'm terrified. I'm terrified
that I'm so content

01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:10.733
and terrified that I'm so not.

01:00:20.284 --> 01:00:21.368
Does that make any sense?

01:00:24.914 --> 01:00:28.458
You know, I never told Brad
that I took that pregnancy test.

01:00:28.459 --> 01:00:32.296
That's all right. I mean, it would
be one thing if it were positive.

01:00:34.048 --> 01:00:36.801
Okay, but the point is I should
be able to tell him everything.

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:40.470
Especially something like that.

01:00:40.471 --> 01:00:41.722
And I can't.

01:00:44.767 --> 01:00:45.976
That's okay.

01:00:48.062 --> 01:00:49.146
You told me.

01:01:08.415 --> 01:01:09.415
I really like you.

01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:19.425
I should go.

01:01:52.084 --> 01:01:53.210
Where you been?

01:01:54.378 --> 01:01:57.005
Out with Brad.

01:01:57.006 --> 01:02:00.006
Well, that's funny. 'Cause he's been
calling here all night looking for you.

01:02:01.969 --> 01:02:03.596
You leading a double
life, Pinocchio?

01:02:06.682 --> 01:02:08.766
Aw, come on.

01:02:08.767 --> 01:02:11.228
It's cool. People consider me
shady too, believe it or not.

01:02:31.916 --> 01:02:34.000
So I've still been thinking
about your friend Heather.

01:02:34.001 --> 01:02:35.001
Oh, yeah?

01:02:36.128 --> 01:02:37.879
Can I get her number?

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.714
Well, I should probably
ask her before I give it out.

01:02:39.715 --> 01:02:40.799
Don't be such a bitch.

01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:43.709
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

01:02:45.846 --> 01:02:49.057
Oh, how's...
how's Amber?

01:02:49.058 --> 01:02:52.060
That's funny. She asked the
same thing about you last night.

01:02:52.061 --> 01:02:54.897
Oh, that is funny.
What did you tell her?

01:02:55.981 --> 01:02:58.566
Said you were all right.

01:02:58.567 --> 01:03:01.444
Crawling up my list little by
little every day, popcorn man.

01:03:01.445 --> 01:03:02.445
Great news!

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:06.532
Charlie!

01:03:09.912 --> 01:03:11.079
What's that number?

01:03:19.004 --> 01:03:22.549
You drink a lot, huh?
You get sick all the time?

01:03:24.051 --> 01:03:25.135
You're being rude.

01:03:26.804 --> 01:03:28.722
No, I find it makes
me feel better.

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:35.521
All right, let's cut to the
chase. What's your story?

01:03:36.855 --> 01:03:39.441
- My story?
- Yeah, your dude situation.

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:46.406
Okay, uh, well I'd say
pretty standard.

01:03:46.407 --> 01:03:50.369
I've been in a whole bunch of dead end
relationships, et cetera, et cetera.

01:03:52.454 --> 01:03:53.497
I'm a romantic.

01:03:56.083 --> 01:03:59.585
But I think co-dependency
is pathetic.

01:03:59.586 --> 01:04:02.256
So I just keep my distance unless
the guy's totally worth it.

01:04:04.466 --> 01:04:05.466
Noted.

01:04:07.761 --> 01:04:08.761
How about you?

01:04:10.639 --> 01:04:11.639
Uh...

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:16.436
I don't really date.

01:04:16.437 --> 01:04:22.525
I was engaged a little while back but I got
left two weeks before the wedding, so...

01:04:22.526 --> 01:04:27.739
Oh, wow. Really?

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:30.951
She said that some day I'd
understand and then she hung up.

01:04:32.995 --> 01:04:33.996
Did you ever understand?

01:04:35.289 --> 01:04:39.417
Nope. No.

01:04:39.418 --> 01:04:43.629
Wow. I can't believe you were
so close to getting married.

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:46.800
Yeah. Well, close only counts
in hand grenades, right?

01:04:48.969 --> 01:04:50.887
You ever speak to her?

01:04:50.888 --> 01:04:52.264
Uh, no, sir, I do not.

01:04:53.432 --> 01:04:54.433
That makes sense.

01:04:56.185 --> 01:04:58.936
Well, I don't believe
in real closure anyway.

01:04:58.937 --> 01:05:03.066
It's like having a last meal
before an execution.

01:05:03.067 --> 01:05:05.568
What, you know that
'cause you were executed?

01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:07.696
Chris? Thank you.

01:05:09.531 --> 01:05:13.201
No. I'm sorry.

01:05:13.202 --> 01:05:14.661
I was being nice.

01:05:23.128 --> 01:05:26.798
Okay, Jack, are we ever gonna
get to a point in the night

01:05:26.799 --> 01:05:31.011
where you take down that "I'm obviously an
insecure asshole" wall? Or should I go?

01:05:32.805 --> 01:05:35.598
'Cause I know that
guys like you do this,

01:05:35.599 --> 01:05:38.159
but you're making me wonder why
you called me in the first place.

01:05:46.485 --> 01:05:51.073
Okay, um, I'm gonna go.
I'm sorry.

01:05:52.491 --> 01:05:53.491
Hola.

01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:56.703

Yeah, I'm just overwhelmed.

01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:21.311
Do you wanna talk about it?

01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:26.150
Is it Brad?

01:06:41.957 --> 01:06:44.084

01:06:57.598 --> 01:06:58.598

01:07:14.198 --> 01:07:15.198
So what's wrong?

01:07:17.034 --> 01:07:18.826
Okay, here's the thing...

01:07:18.827 --> 01:07:21.579
I'm going to school in a few weeks
and I have a lot to figure out.

01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:23.582
- I know.
- Do you?

01:07:26.585 --> 01:07:27.705

That day, those keys
I said weren't mine...

01:08:05.791 --> 01:08:07.792
I was just so nervous.

01:08:07.793 --> 01:08:10.153

Hey, fellas.

01:09:33.377 --> 01:09:35.837
Steve-o. I have a question
for you. Don't lie to me.

01:09:35.839 --> 01:09:37.756
- You like playing video games?
- Yeah!

01:09:37.758 --> 01:09:39.884
- Is that arcade on Government still open?
- Uh-huh.

01:09:39.885 --> 01:09:41.676
All right, I want you two guys
to go on down there

01:09:41.678 --> 01:09:43.763
and get some games in on me.

01:09:43.764 --> 01:09:47.642
That job in New Orleans came through, and
I ran into a little bit of cash, so.

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:52.313
Okay, take it easy there, pal.
I just had this washed.

01:09:52.314 --> 01:09:54.024
All right, go celebrate for me.

01:09:56.068 --> 01:09:58.070
About time I made someone's
day around here, huh?

01:09:59.821 --> 01:10:00.821
Yes! Come on!

01:10:25.889 --> 01:10:27.681
What's wrong?

01:10:27.682 --> 01:10:29.476
I'm just dealing with
some stuff right now.

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:31.560
Like what kind of stuff?

01:10:32.938 --> 01:10:36.816
You know. Anxiety?

01:10:36.817 --> 01:10:42.280
Rejection. Inferiority. Paralysis.
Character issues. Moral issues.

01:10:44.366 --> 01:10:45.366
Life stuff.

01:10:50.163 --> 01:10:52.124
I've never been
the bad guy before, you know?

01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:56.585
But I love you.

01:10:58.380 --> 01:10:59.631
I love you too, buddy.

01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:03.009
Ow! Jesus, Steven!

01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:32.788
Come here, honey.

01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:36.250
Charlie...

01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:40.379
What happened?

01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:42.966
I was out running errands,
and I came home to this.

01:11:44.676 --> 01:11:46.302
Where's Dad?

01:11:46.303 --> 01:11:49.556
The neighbors said they saw him
our front with a moving truck.

01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:53.401
Do you have any idea
where he can be reached?

01:11:55.395 --> 01:11:56.395
No.

01:12:06.865 --> 01:12:07.865
I'm sorry, Mom.

01:12:10.076 --> 01:12:11.161
It's not your fault, honey.

01:12:31.389 --> 01:12:32.557
"Dear Chucky.

01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:37.102
"I'll return it all.
You have my word.

01:12:37.103 --> 01:12:40.022
"Just make sure your mother
doesn't get too mad.

01:12:40.023 --> 01:12:43.151
I know deep down
she understands. I love you."

01:13:35.996 --> 01:13:37.036
Are you serious right now?

01:13:43.378 --> 01:13:45.255
- What's your problem?
- Nothing.

01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:51.510
All right.

01:14:11.197 --> 01:14:13.241
Brad! You okay?

01:14:22.751 --> 01:14:25.920
Charlie? What are
you doing here?

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:32.968
Oh, my God.

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:35.721
It's a bad fracture.

01:14:35.722 --> 01:14:38.183
Shouldn't be career ending,
but his season's over.

01:14:52.155 --> 01:14:53.989
What the hell happened?

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:56.742
Uh, it was an accident.
We were racing...

01:14:56.743 --> 01:14:59.245
- You were racing?
- We were, you know... he was...

01:15:03.625 --> 01:15:04.709
I was being an asshole.

01:15:15.637 --> 01:15:16.637
How have you been?

01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:21.225
- Other than this, obviously.
- Other than this?

01:15:21.226 --> 01:15:23.686
You've been on my mind.

01:15:23.687 --> 01:15:25.522
I don't... do you think
this is a good time?

01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:29.692
- No. No.
- Yeah.

01:15:29.693 --> 01:15:34.280
No, but I feel like it's the only
time I'm gonna get to see you again.

01:15:45.125 --> 01:15:46.418
When are you leaving for school?

01:15:49.337 --> 01:15:50.880
My dad's coming to
get me next week.

01:15:57.721 --> 01:16:00.305
Okay, well, I have to
get back to Brad.

01:16:00.306 --> 01:16:03.435
Yeah. No, of course.
Tell him I'm so sorry.

01:16:06.271 --> 01:16:07.313
I will.

01:16:29.461 --> 01:16:30.461
Hayden.

01:17:04.245 --> 01:17:06.706
No, no, no, no!

01:17:09.417 --> 01:17:10.627
Got it!

01:17:18.885 --> 01:17:19.885
Got it.

01:17:38.613 --> 01:17:39.613
Does it feel weird?

01:17:40.865 --> 01:17:42.115
I had crutches when I was nine.

01:17:42.116 --> 01:17:43.636
What's your deal
with that guy Charlie?

01:17:44.661 --> 01:17:45.661
Nothing.

01:17:47.872 --> 01:17:48.872
Do you like him?

01:17:49.916 --> 01:17:51.500
Yeah, I like him.
He's my friend.

01:17:51.501 --> 01:17:52.501
But do you like him?

01:17:54.087 --> 01:17:55.607
- Yeah, sure.
- Do you like him, Amber?

01:17:57.423 --> 01:17:59.063
What, do you think
I'm some kind of idiot?

01:18:01.052 --> 01:18:02.178
How could you do this to me?

01:18:11.604 --> 01:18:12.764
So you don't love me anymore?

01:18:15.817 --> 01:18:20.112
I don't know. Things are
confusing right now.

01:18:20.113 --> 01:18:22.614
Look, this type of shit
just doesn't happen.

01:18:22.615 --> 01:18:25.075
Okay? You can't just fall out
of love with someone.

01:18:25.076 --> 01:18:26.411
That doesn't happen.

01:18:30.039 --> 01:18:31.039
You love him?

01:18:33.710 --> 01:18:36.004
No, but...

01:18:39.007 --> 01:18:40.091
I don't know, I...

01:18:42.677 --> 01:18:44.679
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

01:18:48.558 --> 01:18:50.183
Have you slept with him?

01:18:50.184 --> 01:18:53.313
No! How could you
ask me such things?

01:18:55.106 --> 01:18:57.232
- What do you want me to say?
- I want you to tell me...

01:18:57.233 --> 01:19:00.068
What do you want me to say? Tell me what you
want me to say, and I'll fucking say it!

01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:02.237
I want you to tell me you don't
give a shit about that guy,

01:19:02.238 --> 01:19:04.531
who, by the way, put me
in goddamn crutches!

01:19:04.532 --> 01:19:05.825
I just need to take a breath.

01:19:08.119 --> 01:19:12.539
I feel like I haven't taken
a real breath in a long time.

01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:14.958
You've gotta be
kidding me right now.

01:19:14.959 --> 01:19:18.211
I'm sorry. I don't know.

01:19:18.212 --> 01:19:20.757
I know you don't know.
You've said it 15 times already.

01:19:21.883 --> 01:19:22.883
Okay, I just...

01:19:26.054 --> 01:19:28.306
I just want things to be
okay between us.

01:19:29.515 --> 01:19:31.391
Okay? That's all I want.

01:19:31.392 --> 01:19:32.727
They're not okay!

01:19:34.062 --> 01:19:35.979
What? You think this
is okay right now?

01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:37.023
You think I'm okay?

01:19:38.358 --> 01:19:39.776
Let me guess.
You don't know.

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.446
Hmm? You don't know.

01:19:47.575 --> 01:19:50.410
Yeah, you let me know
when you do, okay?

01:19:50.411 --> 01:19:51.454
Brad.

01:20:38.418 --> 01:20:39.418
How's it going?

01:20:40.837 --> 01:20:42.255
At least I've got a good book.

01:20:48.594 --> 01:20:49.846
I'm gonna get our stuff back.

01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:54.099
It's all right.
We're insured...

01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:55.268
No, it's not all right.

01:20:58.771 --> 01:21:00.023
You know where your dad is?

01:22:09.175 --> 01:22:10.455
Charlie!
What are you doing here?

01:22:12.095 --> 01:22:13.096
Come on in.

01:22:16.682 --> 01:22:19.101
- How'd you know I was here?
- You told me.

01:22:19.102 --> 01:22:20.228
Oh, right.

01:22:21.854 --> 01:22:23.730
How's that job going,
by the way?

01:22:23.731 --> 01:22:26.608
Oh, I didn't get it. They went with
another guy with more experience.

01:22:26.609 --> 01:22:28.026
What can you do, right?

01:22:28.027 --> 01:22:29.507
So how come you're
still staying here?

01:22:34.534 --> 01:22:36.661
I sold your mother's
television to get the room.

01:22:40.414 --> 01:22:42.791
So looking to staying
at the Riverview Plaza!

01:22:42.792 --> 01:22:45.502
I just figured
I owed it to myself.

01:22:45.503 --> 01:22:47.880
- At least I'm honest.
- Come on, you're not honest.

01:22:50.091 --> 01:22:51.091
I got something for you.

01:23:00.268 --> 01:23:02.144
Put it on. Put this on.
You're gonna love it.

01:23:02.145 --> 01:23:04.896
- Dad. Dad.
- It feels great. Now come on.

01:23:04.897 --> 01:23:06.417
Please. Just try it on
for the old man.

01:23:13.281 --> 01:23:14.532
Uh-huh.

01:23:18.828 --> 01:23:21.122
Look at you. Come here.

01:23:23.958 --> 01:23:25.917
All right?

01:23:25.918 --> 01:23:26.961
There you are.

01:23:30.131 --> 01:23:31.340
This is what it's all about.

01:23:35.595 --> 01:23:36.721
You're a class act.

01:23:41.434 --> 01:23:44.154
I'm gonna write your mother a check
as soon as I get back on my feet.

01:23:45.479 --> 01:23:48.106
Double what I owe.

01:23:48.107 --> 01:23:50.567
Besides, that lawyer husband of hers,
he can buy her anything she wants.

01:23:50.568 --> 01:23:54.238
It's not just about her.
What about me?

01:23:58.618 --> 01:24:01.537
- Come on, have some compassion.
- Oh, fuck you, Dad!

01:24:04.332 --> 01:24:05.333
Fuck you!

01:24:09.795 --> 01:24:13.506
I really got myself into
a jam this time, Charles.

01:24:13.507 --> 01:24:16.092
I was gonna get hurt if I
didn't pay these guys back.

01:24:16.093 --> 01:24:18.220
So you hurt everyone else.
And when does it stop?

01:24:18.221 --> 01:24:21.389
You know, you've got problems too.
Yours are even worse than mine.

01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:23.017
Now what the hell
are you talking about?

01:24:25.019 --> 01:24:28.313
I know about your girlfriend.
I know she got an abortion.

01:24:28.314 --> 01:24:30.357
I can only imagine what
you're going through.

01:24:30.358 --> 01:24:33.860
- What are you talking about?
- You don't have to hide things from me.

01:24:33.861 --> 01:24:35.695
I mean, I know you don't
want me in your business,

01:24:35.696 --> 01:24:37.530
but I had to do
some training for the job

01:24:37.531 --> 01:24:39.532
which, for the record,
I should've gotten

01:24:39.533 --> 01:24:43.703
and I just followed her around. I mean,
she seemed as good a subject as any.

01:24:43.704 --> 01:24:47.332
And I also did a little work on Benny.
Tell him congratulations on the bar exam.

01:24:47.333 --> 01:24:48.875
He didn't get his scores yet.

01:24:48.876 --> 01:24:51.670
No, yeah, he did. He did
really well. I'm proud of him.

01:24:51.671 --> 01:24:54.381
I couldn't help myself.

01:24:54.382 --> 01:24:58.009
Look, there's no harm no foul. I put the
envelope, sealed it, done, sent it off to him.

01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:59.928
He didn't get it yet?

01:24:59.929 --> 01:25:01.721
No, that's for you to keep.

01:25:01.722 --> 01:25:03.848
- Where's the furniture?
- That's for you to keep.

01:25:03.849 --> 01:25:04.849
Where's our furniture?

01:25:08.354 --> 01:25:09.521
It's at a storage place.

01:25:09.522 --> 01:25:11.231
- I'm taking it back with me.
- No. No.

01:25:11.232 --> 01:25:12.732
- Yes.
- No.

01:25:12.733 --> 01:25:17.780
No, Charlie, please.
Just until I'm back on my feet.

01:25:19.407 --> 01:25:24.744
I am giving you this chance,
Dad. Do the right thing.

01:25:24.745 --> 01:25:26.038
Just until I'm back on my feet.

01:25:29.125 --> 01:25:32.669
Charles. Go on. Go on.

01:25:32.670 --> 01:25:33.671
- Bye.
- Go on.

01:25:37.341 --> 01:25:39.510
You understand?

01:26:22.178 --> 01:26:24.555
You know, I'm starting to think
I might be depressed.

01:26:30.478 --> 01:26:32.187
- You're all right.
- Get off me, asshole!

01:26:32.188 --> 01:26:34.647
Watch the... focus.

01:26:34.648 --> 01:26:37.368
I really think you should come with
me to New York if I pass the bar.

01:26:38.819 --> 01:26:40.613
You could use a break
from all this shit.

01:26:44.158 --> 01:26:45.201
Maybe I will.

01:26:47.578 --> 01:26:48.788
- Really.
- Mm-hmm.

01:26:50.539 --> 01:26:52.999
Ah, damn. Now I really
hope I passed.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.170
Trust me on this one, okay?
You passed.

01:27:09.725 --> 01:27:10.925
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:27:25.408 --> 01:27:29.703
Roses? Can you get
any more stereotypical?

01:27:35.543 --> 01:27:37.460
Well, you just answered that.

01:27:37.461 --> 01:27:39.581
I've been chasing this little
bastard for a long time.

01:27:41.382 --> 01:27:43.758
I finally caught up to him,
but the thing is,

01:27:43.759 --> 01:27:46.261
I kind of wish I hadn't.

01:27:46.262 --> 01:27:50.390
Once I captured his beautiful ass, I realized
there was no one there to share him with.

01:27:50.391 --> 01:27:52.935
Wow. You really are insane.

01:27:54.019 --> 01:27:55.019
Yeah.

01:27:57.648 --> 01:27:59.048
I'm not good
with this kind of shit.

01:28:01.026 --> 01:28:07.449
But, Heather, I like you.
I think you're cool, you know?

01:28:07.450 --> 01:28:09.618
And kind of pretty and...

01:28:10.953 --> 01:28:12.954
That is to say,
I think you're pretty.

01:28:12.955 --> 01:28:14.331
Exceedingly so.

01:28:17.585 --> 01:28:19.295
I'm sorry about
being a dick before.

01:28:20.588 --> 01:28:23.882
And I know that I have issues.

01:28:23.883 --> 01:28:26.802
I also know that just knowing
doesn't make it okay.

01:28:29.763 --> 01:28:31.849
But I think that's a first step.

01:28:33.893 --> 01:28:34.893
So...

01:28:38.981 --> 01:28:39.981
there.

01:28:42.610 --> 01:28:43.610
Give me that.

01:29:09.136 --> 01:29:10.678
- Hello?
- Trevor?

01:29:10.679 --> 01:29:13.932
- Yep.
- It's Charlie Brenner.

01:29:13.933 --> 01:29:16.726
I'm from this...
well, I was in this...

01:29:16.727 --> 01:29:18.978
Charlie. Charlie.
Charlie Brenner!

01:29:18.979 --> 01:29:21.814
Yeah, I remember exactly who you are.
How are you, son?

01:29:21.815 --> 01:29:25.860
Good. I'm good.
Actually, I'm moving.

01:29:25.861 --> 01:29:27.780
I'm moving to New York.

01:29:30.282 --> 01:29:31.282
It goes right in there.

01:29:40.292 --> 01:29:42.461
Hey. Can I talk to you?

01:29:47.132 --> 01:29:51.344
Listen, I appreciate
everything you've done for me,

01:29:51.345 --> 01:29:53.347
but I'm moving to New York
with a friend of mine.

01:29:54.723 --> 01:29:56.003
I'm ready to start
a new chapter.

01:30:00.271 --> 01:30:02.814
- You're not mad?
- No.

01:30:02.815 --> 01:30:06.109
You didn't seem to have the right
passion for this job anymore anyway.

01:30:06.110 --> 01:30:10.613
I'm bored. Can we close
this bitch up already?

01:30:10.614 --> 01:30:11.614
First...

01:30:13.701 --> 01:30:16.829
take care of the ladies' shitter,
Mr. Assistant Manager.

01:30:18.747 --> 01:30:19.747
Yeah?

01:30:20.749 --> 01:30:21.749
Get to it.

01:30:23.085 --> 01:30:24.085
Nice!

01:30:26.046 --> 01:30:29.216
And that right there?
That's passion.

01:30:38.142 --> 01:30:39.768
Charlie! Hey.

01:30:41.395 --> 01:30:42.896
Oh, hey.

01:30:44.231 --> 01:30:46.649
I'm just picking up
Jack from work.

01:30:46.650 --> 01:30:49.695
Yeah, I was just with him.
What are you guys doing?

01:30:51.447 --> 01:30:54.450
Amber's having her goodbye
party tonight at Cow Fiend.

01:30:57.620 --> 01:30:59.287
Do you wanna come?

01:30:59.288 --> 01:31:02.582
No, I've got a lot
of packing to do,

01:31:02.583 --> 01:31:04.167
but you guys have fun.

01:31:04.168 --> 01:31:05.502
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:31:06.670 --> 01:31:08.046
- All right.
- All right.

01:31:08.047 --> 01:31:09.207
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.

01:31:11.008 --> 01:31:12.468
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:31:23.437 --> 01:31:24.647
I'm not pregnant.

01:31:30.110 --> 01:31:31.986
- Amber!
- Hi!

01:31:31.987 --> 01:31:34.864

01:33:01.952 --> 01:33:04.121
- How are you?
- I'm good.

01:33:07.583 --> 01:33:10.835
Oh, I got a job.
In New York.

01:33:10.836 --> 01:33:13.004
- Wow.
- I'm gonna be an assistant chef

01:33:13.005 --> 01:33:14.214
in a new restaurant downtown.

01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:16.591
That's amazing.

01:33:16.592 --> 01:33:21.888
It's pretty...
out of nowhere, but good.

01:33:21.889 --> 01:33:25.809
It's a step in the right direction,
or in any direction at least.

01:33:33.108 --> 01:33:35.526
How's Brad's leg?

01:33:35.527 --> 01:33:36.527
Uh...

01:33:37.988 --> 01:33:41.240
I hope it's okay.
I mean, I don't know.

01:33:41.241 --> 01:33:42.701
We've taken some time off.

01:33:44.661 --> 01:33:45.913
I have a lot to figure out.

01:33:48.665 --> 01:33:52.127
- Look, I want you to know...
- I-I... I do know.

01:33:55.005 --> 01:34:00.259
I'm going through a lot.
Maybe more than you know.

01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:05.057
I don't wanna get into it,
but... it's been tough.

01:34:12.731 --> 01:34:13.731
Well...

01:34:15.818 --> 01:34:17.444
maybe I'll see you around.

01:34:18.987 --> 01:34:22.114
In New York or something?

01:34:22.115 --> 01:34:23.951
Yeah. I'd like that.

01:34:26.370 --> 01:34:27.412
Give me your phone.

01:34:34.586 --> 01:34:37.547
So this is my new number,

01:34:37.548 --> 01:34:40.424
and one of the digits
might be off, I think.

01:34:40.425 --> 01:34:42.928
So I'll just take that
as a very clear hint.

01:34:47.182 --> 01:34:48.182
I'll see you.

01:34:50.519 --> 01:34:51.519
I'll see you.

01:34:53.230 --> 01:34:54.230
Okay.
