02:24.040 --> 02:26.190
Hey, love your umbrella.

02:40.640 --> 02:43.757
- Dr. Mills. Dr. Budlong.
- Morosini, Carvalho, come with me.

02:46.080 --> 02:50.551
If he thinks he's going to ruin any more
equipment he's underestimated the facility.

02:56.600 --> 03:00.309
- He thinks he's cute, doesn't he?
- Yes, but I was mother's favourite.

03:00.600 --> 03:01.715
Dr. Mills.

03:03.480 --> 03:07.189
- This is the last time I'll warn you.
- I won't let the Klystron go above 300.

03:07.280 --> 03:10.431
Thas what you said last time it rained,
but you turned it to 350.

03:10.520 --> 03:13.159
Do you know what it costs
to repair a Klystron tube?

03:13.240 --> 03:16.915
I know, Dr. Budlong. I'm very sorry,
but believe me it won't happen again.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.434
You have my word on that, and I promise.

03:19.920 --> 03:23.515
Don't worry. He can't go blowing up
your Klyman tube or whatever it is.

03:23.600 --> 03:26.273
We've got a date tonight,
happy hour at Mingles.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.430
Mingles. You know what that means?

03:28.680 --> 03:29.510
What?

03:29.760 --> 03:31.716
It means complimentary hors ďoeuvres.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.678
A veritable who's who
of secretaries and beauticians.

03:34.760 --> 03:36.796
It means 20th century music.

03:37.360 --> 03:40.955
You look like a sensible man.
You believe there's life on other planets?

03:41.040 --> 03:44.032
- I don't believe there's life in this room.
- Exactly.

03:44.440 --> 03:48.479
Your brother wants to send a radar signal
to a point in space so far away...

03:48.600 --> 03:51.558
...id take 92 years to get there
and 92 years to get back.

03:51.640 --> 03:53.915
Ninety-two years? Steve, we're late now.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.390
Indeed. There isn't anything
out there, Dr. Mills.

03:57.480 --> 03:58.515
We're it.

03:59.240 --> 04:03.199
Now don't you go above 300
or I'm revoking your funding.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.956
Now that Dr. Strangelove is gone, les go.
Mingles is at high party.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.553
I can't tonight, Ron.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.069
Is raining.

04:14.160 --> 04:17.947
Tonight I've got another destination
in mind. I wanna go right there.

04:19.640 --> 04:23.599
Clouds of Magellan. It sounds like
some kind of woman's underwear.

04:24.240 --> 04:27.357
No, the Clouds of Magellan is
the name of our neighbouring galaxy.

04:27.440 --> 04:29.715
You want to send a radar signal
to the next galaxy?

04:29.800 --> 04:31.677
You can't get radar to the next galaxy.

04:31.760 --> 04:35.150
You'd have to travel faster than
the speed of light. No one can do that.

04:35.240 --> 04:38.152
Don't watch that, it won't change.
This is the one to watch.

04:38.240 --> 04:39.878
I like the Clouds of Magellan.

04:39.960 --> 04:41.439
We can't get there, Ron.

04:41.520 --> 04:44.478
But if we increase the power of
the Klystron, with lightning...

04:44.560 --> 04:47.791
...we may get a signal strong enough
to get out of the solar system.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.233
Thas the theory, anyway.

04:49.320 --> 04:52.710
Right. Thanks.
Tell me something I don't know.

04:55.080 --> 04:58.629
Can't this wait? Secretaries are
like animals when it comes to free food.

04:58.720 --> 05:01.678
The reflectors line up for 10 days
only once every 19 months.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.320
Now, with all this rain
and lightning, is perfect.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.879
Perfect for men like us.

05:05.960 --> 05:09.475
Christ! Steve, when was the last time
you went out with a woman?

05:10.760 --> 05:13.911
January of '86. No. March of '86.

05:14.760 --> 05:18.514
I took Dr. Elizabeth Conway
to see the Halley's Comet retrospective.

05:18.600 --> 05:19.555
Superb.

05:19.640 --> 05:21.676
- You see it?
- Sure, a couple of times.

05:21.760 --> 05:25.150
How can we be brothers?
We don't have a single gene in common.

05:26.240 --> 05:28.800
- Not above 300 kilowatts.
- Hi.

05:31.600 --> 05:34.319
Okay. Thank you. Have fun.

05:36.400 --> 05:40.029
We have no time to sweep frequencies.
We'll lower it below three centimetres.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.031
But below?

05:42.600 --> 05:45.194
Is raining out here. I'm getting wet!

05:45.920 --> 05:48.354
This jacket is a Ralph Lauren!

05:48.920 --> 05:50.319
And is smelly.

05:50.520 --> 05:51.919
Great, just great.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.878
I'm wet and smelly.
They're gonna jump all over me.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.315
Do you guys smell fish?

06:07.120 --> 06:08.553
Is me!

06:20.320 --> 06:23.869
- Help me rotate the dish.
- Where's this lightning supposed to strike?

06:23.960 --> 06:25.075
Right here.

06:26.280 --> 06:27.235
Here?

06:29.600 --> 06:31.397
That almost hit my shoe.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.754
Excuse me.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.394
All the way up.

06:51.520 --> 06:54.080
I hate this. What the hell is this thing?

06:54.440 --> 06:58.672
Klystron tube. Potential of 400 megawatts,
at an oscillation of 60 gigahertz.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.076
Great. Why don't we take this to Mingles?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.956
Stupid piece of garbage.

07:08.560 --> 07:11.120
Now all we gotta do
is harness the lightning.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.838
Yes, is good. Les try for lightning.

07:27.960 --> 07:30.190
- Is this important?
- Only if it works.

07:30.680 --> 07:33.069
Okay, deep breath. Set your retractors.

07:33.360 --> 07:37.035
How long is this gonna take?
Single women have short attention spans.

07:38.600 --> 07:40.477
Prepare to initiate the system.

07:41.520 --> 07:42.714
Now!

07:43.360 --> 07:44.839
Oh, Jesus!

07:49.280 --> 07:51.271
- We got it!
- Look at it!

07:52.680 --> 07:55.069
Is going! I love you!

08:19.720 --> 08:21.312
What is happening?

08:22.120 --> 08:24.793
Steve! Whas happening?

08:27.960 --> 08:28.995
Mills!

08:29.600 --> 08:30.635
Mills!

08:31.160 --> 08:33.150
What is happening?

08:42.200 --> 08:43.679
The Klystron!

09:03.040 --> 09:05.508
We have a red condicion in che second unic.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.275
Fire concrol/ The laboracory area.

09:12.840 --> 09:13.989
I'm okay.

09:19.640 --> 09:21.232
Beautiful!

09:24.880 --> 09:25.869
What?

09:26.720 --> 09:27.675
My God!

09:28.040 --> 09:31.430
I didn't only get out of the solar system,
I just went out of the galaxy.

09:31.520 --> 09:34.432
That means we were travelling faster
than the speed of light.

09:34.520 --> 09:36.192
How the hell did we do that?

09:54.680 --> 09:56.159
Eleven seconds on the clock.

09:56.240 --> 09:58.993
Down by one. Mills fakes left.
Goes around Magic Johnson.

09:59.080 --> 10:01.389
Puts Kareem in the popcorn machine.

10:08.320 --> 10:13.110
Why can't I dunk? Is that asking so much?

10:24.600 --> 10:27.160
You got out of the galaxy
and they fired you?

10:28.160 --> 10:30.958
We were using lightning
to boost the power of the Klystron.

10:31.040 --> 10:34.271
I shorted every telemetry tracker
in the place and all my monitors.

10:34.360 --> 10:35.839
So there's no proof.

10:37.760 --> 10:39.079
Thas not fair.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.438
What are we going to do?

10:42.160 --> 10:44.594
I might just have to take a...

10:45.360 --> 10:46.236
What?

10:46.600 --> 10:48.079
Take a teaching job.

10:49.360 --> 10:52.318
You know how that is?
One position for every 16 applicants.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.197
I could double my babysitting.

10:54.280 --> 10:56.157
Or take up a newspaper route.

10:56.760 --> 10:58.273
Do girls do that now?

11:00.760 --> 11:02.830
Is beautiful up there.

11:04.960 --> 11:07.349
Two hundred billion stars in our galaxy.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.070
Thas really my office up there.

11:10.840 --> 11:14.753
I wish Mom could have lived long enough
to see you get out of the galaxy.

11:14.880 --> 11:17.633
She'd be having the whole block in
for champagne!

11:20.200 --> 11:22.760
Think you'll ever find
anyone like her again?

11:24.800 --> 11:27.189
Boy. Jess, I don't know.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.676
The chances of me finding another woman
like your mother are the same...

11:31.760 --> 11:35.753
...as me proving there's life on another
planet up there. Figure one in 16 billion.

11:38.520 --> 11:40.954
All right, Larry Byrd, whas for dinner?

11:41.040 --> 11:42.632
Fish sticks. Pop tarts.

11:42.720 --> 11:45.917
Frozen pizza. Whatever else we can nuke
in the microwave.

11:49.400 --> 11:50.958
What do you say, Dave?

11:51.480 --> 11:53.232
Can we see Sirius tonight?

11:54.640 --> 11:57.029
You know, is also called the Dog Star.

12:01.480 --> 12:02.469
Come on.

12:37.760 --> 12:41.958
- Is quite a small planet, really.
- Half che size of ours, buc very busy.

12:42.960 --> 12:45.190
- Have you mastered it yet?
- Of course.

12:45.320 --> 12:47.356
You know how superb our research is.

12:47.440 --> 12:50.398
All I have co do is ceach you
everyching I know in 20 minuces.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.948
We're at light 30 approaching light 35.

12:53.160 --> 12:56.516
This is a record glide speed.
They didn'c chink we'd make ic chis fasc.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.591
Look, is Saturn.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.880
- Could we stop there on the way back?
- Maybe.

13:03.040 --> 13:05.508
Why can't I fit Neptune into this picture?

13:07.120 --> 13:08.678
Wait. That works.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.875
Neptunians won't like it, though.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.228
Les see here.

13:15.760 --> 13:17.239
Look at Neptune now!

13:17.680 --> 13:20.558
- Dad, we'll be late for Uncle Ron's party.
- Look at Neptune.

13:20.640 --> 13:22.835
I haven't finished the M.I.T. Proposal yet.

13:22.920 --> 13:25.673
- Come on.
- I hate leaving the universe in such a mess.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.193
Here, put this on.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.155
Look at this.
Do these things ever work? No.

13:30.240 --> 13:33.312
The modern light bulb has a half-life
of about 10 minutes.

13:33.400 --> 13:36.517
- I'm going to take it apart.
- Is not the bulb, is the switch.

13:36.720 --> 13:39.109
You've been meaning to fix it, remember.

13:42.640 --> 13:43.959
Dad, you're impossible.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.553
Do we have any socks?

13:50.720 --> 13:53.871
See, I knew I had a pair in reserve.
And they're dry.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.718
I've been cooking 'em since yesterday.

13:55.800 --> 13:58.997
Daddy, look at me.
Do you see anything different about me?

14:02.400 --> 14:03.799
I'm wearing a bra.

14:04.160 --> 14:06.310
You can't be! You're only 13!

14:07.880 --> 14:09.029
My God!

14:10.320 --> 14:11.389
You're 13.

14:13.240 --> 14:14.275
A bra?

14:17.960 --> 14:20.269
Well, did you get the right strap size?

14:20.400 --> 14:23.153
Cup size. Yeah, A-minus.

14:30.040 --> 14:31.439
Where have I been?

14:44.240 --> 14:47.869
How can I learn everything I need to know
in only six more minutes?

14:48.040 --> 14:49.758
This is a very backward planec.

14:49.840 --> 14:54.197
The Mondschein 40 is che mosc advanced
research facilicy in che norchern universe.

14:54.480 --> 14:58.393
Research has decermined you musc be
che mosc desirable woman on che planec.

Men on Earch will fall co cheir knees...

15:00.840 --> 15:04.719
...becray cheir councries and give away
real escace for a beauciful woman.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.199
Thas silly.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.433
Will I need to eat?

15:12.640 --> 15:15.279
No. We'll only be in che place for 24 hours.

15:17.400 --> 15:20.836
This is che mosc imporcanc assignmenc
any of us has undercaken.

15:25.160 --> 15:26.832
I feel so poorly prepared.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.039
You're the Earth expert.

15:29.120 --> 15:33.750
Buc you are che Chief Excragalaccic Probisc.
You know che Council's direccive.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.912
I can only be your adviser.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.191
Are you sure this research is accurate?

15:38.280 --> 15:41.192
Celesce, che Mondschein 40
is never wrong.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.516
Right. Les go.

17:20.079 --> 17:21.308
Hors ďoeuvres?

17:24.000 --> 17:25.035
Kimberly.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.637
- You met my brother Steve?
- No.

17:27.720 --> 17:30.188
You gotta watch out for him,
but in the best sense.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.191
He cares too deeply, like a sparrow.

17:36.160 --> 17:38.230
You've got something on your lip.

17:45.400 --> 17:46.879
A little dip there.

17:48.320 --> 17:50.390
I think flossing is so important, too.

17:50.480 --> 17:53.677
When I get up in the morning,
I don't even go to the bathroom first.

17:53.760 --> 17:55.716
I floss and then I go.

17:56.080 --> 17:57.195
Thas so great.

17:57.280 --> 17:59.919
Ron, I'm beginning to think
you're avoiding me.

18:04.040 --> 18:04.916
Hi.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.552
Are you Dr. Steve Mills?

18:18.120 --> 18:20.998
He's the guy dancing with his daughter.

18:25.360 --> 18:26.839
Hors ďoeuvres?

18:34.040 --> 18:35.553
Thank you. Delicious.

18:38.360 --> 18:39.270
Hello.

18:40.040 --> 18:42.110
- Are you Dr. Steve Mills?
- Yes.

18:42.680 --> 18:45.797
Will you tell me the composition
of your radar beam or not?

18:45.880 --> 18:46.949
Which one?

18:47.280 --> 18:50.238
Now, you don't fool me.
Your favourite colour is red.

18:50.600 --> 18:54.878
Your favourite food is lasagne,
and your favourite rocking is Pink Fred.

18:56.240 --> 18:58.879
Actually, I prefer green,
I'm allergic to all pasta...

18:58.960 --> 19:00.996
...and my favourite rock is Rachmaninoff.

19:02.520 --> 19:04.192
Of course you'd say that.

19:04.280 --> 19:06.840
I think is Pink Floyd,
not Pink Fred right, Jessie?

19:06.920 --> 19:08.672
Pink Fred is their nickname.

19:09.600 --> 19:11.716
Would you hold this for me, please?

19:11.920 --> 19:13.751
"Hey, hey we're the Monkees

19:13.960 --> 19:15.439
"People say we monkey around

19:15.520 --> 19:18.114
"But we're too busy singing
to put anybody down"

19:18.200 --> 19:19.076
What?

19:19.200 --> 19:21.760
Do you know what they say?
"Nixon's the One!"

19:22.000 --> 19:23.115
Dick Nixon?

19:23.840 --> 19:24.750
Okay.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.999
See you later, bro.

19:33.280 --> 19:35.396
Sailor, I like your jeep.

19:35.640 --> 19:38.074
You've broken my heart for the last time.

19:41.520 --> 19:44.080
You've broken my heart
for the last time, too.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.639
Do you have any spinach,
my hands are freezing?

19:49.920 --> 19:53.708
"I'm Popeye the sailor man
I'm Popeye the sailor man

19:54.120 --> 19:56.953
"I'm strong to the 'finich'
'cause I eats me spinach

19:57.040 --> 19:59.315
"I'm Popeye the sailor man
Toot, toot"

20:01.040 --> 20:02.712
"This Buďs for you."

20:10.200 --> 20:11.155
Baby!

20:12.680 --> 20:15.752
Now will you tell me the composition
of your radar beam?

20:15.920 --> 20:17.273
Wackygram, right?

20:20.960 --> 20:22.951
Encore! Encore!

20:25.000 --> 20:26.479
This is a nightmare.

20:26.720 --> 20:29.234
Your research was all wrong!
The food was all wrong!

20:29.320 --> 20:31.595
This dress is strange
and what is this thing?

20:31.680 --> 20:34.956
This hat is too big.
And everything I said was crazy.

20:35.240 --> 20:38.312
Now jusc a second.
Don'c blame ic all on me.

20:38.560 --> 20:41.552
I never cold you chey used spinach
co keep cheir hands warm.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.232
Daddy, who was that?

20:43.640 --> 20:44.834
I don't know.

20:45.520 --> 20:48.990
But I feel kinda sorry for her.
I don't think anybody liked her.

20:49.440 --> 20:50.395
Did you?

20:54.440 --> 20:58.035
How are we ever going to get
Dr. Steve to transmit his signal now?

20:58.720 --> 21:00.312
He thinks I'm a lunatic.

21:00.480 --> 21:02.710
Now jusc calm down.

21:03.480 --> 21:05.550
You've goc co go back in chere.

21:07.640 --> 21:08.709
And you...

21:12.280 --> 21:13.349
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:16.280 --> 21:17.395
Tough room.

21:18.800 --> 21:21.394
I'm really sorry how rude I was in there.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.675
You weren't rude.
You were very entertaining.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.877
In fact, I thought you were
a professional of some kind.

21:27.920 --> 21:31.230
Believe me, they'll be telling
their grandchildren about it.

21:31.320 --> 21:34.357
Have you done any interesting
radar astronomy transmissions...

21:34.440 --> 21:37.637
...which may have penetrated
other galaxies in the last few days?

21:39.720 --> 21:41.199
Yes, I have.

21:42.720 --> 21:44.153
Well, what happened?

21:46.960 --> 21:49.315
- Is pretty complex.
- Try me.

21:51.360 --> 21:54.113
That was the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.111
I mean, second most beautiful.

21:58.480 --> 21:59.390
Third.

22:00.440 --> 22:01.350
A dog.

22:03.400 --> 22:06.437
The system. I blew out every
resistance backup in the place...

22:06.520 --> 22:10.149
...including telemetry trackers.
Those boys from defence were so mad.

22:10.240 --> 22:13.198
'Cause thas what they use
for tracking missiles...

22:13.920 --> 22:16.036
I must be boring the pants off you.

22:20.520 --> 22:22.511
- No. They're still on.
- Good.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.997
- Then what happened, Dr. Steve?
- I don't really know what happened.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.230
It must have been something
I did in the lab.

22:29.320 --> 22:31.993
Maybe I forgot to take a note
or dropped a setting.

22:32.080 --> 22:33.593
Show me what you did.

22:33.880 --> 22:35.632
Show me in your mighty lab.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.838
I can't. They fired me.

22:39.320 --> 22:43.199
You know I'm a little cold.
Would you mind very much if I just...

22:43.840 --> 22:46.229
...stuck my hands right in your pockets?

22:47.200 --> 22:48.838
Yes, thas better.

22:51.880 --> 22:53.950
So, Celeste...

22:55.960 --> 22:57.188
...where are you from?

22:59.160 --> 23:00.513
The nether-lands.

23:00.960 --> 23:02.109
Oh, Holland.

23:02.400 --> 23:03.958
No, the nether-lands.

23:08.040 --> 23:10.998
For an astronomer
you have the most wonderful fibres.

23:12.080 --> 23:14.594
And you've got yourself
a handful right now.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.758
I can't get back in that lab.

23:19.320 --> 23:20.673
They're gonna kiss!

23:20.760 --> 23:22.113
Does he know how?

23:22.320 --> 23:25.835
Well, of course.
I saw him do it once in 1983.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.119
I'm a bad apple.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.633
Excuse me a minute.

23:48.280 --> 23:50.555
I shouldn't be wearing this, should I?

23:51.760 --> 23:52.988
Is very nice.

23:53.280 --> 23:54.918
Then what should I wear?

24:01.040 --> 24:03.031
Thank you. I won't forget this.

24:23.960 --> 24:25.029
Hold this.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.038
What are you doing now?

24:28.160 --> 24:30.469
I have to change. This is inappropriate.

24:30.600 --> 24:33.034
Might I suggest a more conventional spot?

24:33.200 --> 24:35.236
Like the backseat of my car.

24:48.360 --> 24:50.078
There. I'm changed.

24:58.760 --> 25:00.193
Is this acceptable?

25:04.120 --> 25:05.997
Is the drool apparent?

25:24.000 --> 25:27.072
I'm sorry, Dr. Mills, we have strict orders
from Dr. Budlong...

25:27.160 --> 25:28.991
...not to let you in the building.

25:29.080 --> 25:32.436
I left something in my office.
It was a fuzzy Carebear pencil holder.

25:32.520 --> 25:36.069
Excuse me. I'm from DARPA. The Defence
Advance Research Project Agency...

25:36.160 --> 25:38.151
...with instructions to tour this facility.

25:38.240 --> 25:39.958
- So l...
- May I see some ID?

26:00.720 --> 26:01.550
Here.

26:03.360 --> 26:05.078
See Department of Defence.

26:13.680 --> 26:14.999
She's with DARPA.

26:16.440 --> 26:17.634
I'm with her.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.753
All settings are the same.
They haven't changed a thing.

26:21.840 --> 26:24.798
Dr. Steve, this is only
a Jansky-based telescope.

26:25.440 --> 26:27.829
Part of what used to be called a vast array.

26:27.920 --> 26:28.909
Used to?

26:29.520 --> 26:31.750
I see you had to use enormous thrust.

26:32.200 --> 26:33.713
Where's the Klystron?

26:34.280 --> 26:36.669
Hold on, I'll see what they did with it.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.672
- Good evening, Olaf.
- Good evening.

26:54.760 --> 26:56.557
Is nice to have Dr. Mills back.

26:56.640 --> 26:58.631
- What do you mean?
- He's in his lab now.

26:58.720 --> 26:59.914
In his lab?

27:04.560 --> 27:08.189
There's nothing powerful enough
to have broken through our shields.

27:13.360 --> 27:15.476
Is clear how the reflectors work.

27:17.200 --> 27:21.079
They're not equipped to discover
this kind of power for another century.

27:22.680 --> 27:24.432
How did they get it so fast?

27:24.520 --> 27:27.193
I mean, they haven't even
figured out Stonehenge.

27:27.280 --> 27:31.193
He musc be holding someching back.

27:31.480 --> 27:33.152
Dr. Sceve is lying.

27:36.320 --> 27:37.469
Who are you?

27:38.240 --> 27:39.958
Who? Me?

27:40.800 --> 27:42.392
What are you doing here?

27:52.240 --> 27:53.514
Where's Mills?

27:54.320 --> 27:56.072
Get away from my equipment.

28:22.560 --> 28:24.471
I've got to be on my way home.

28:26.040 --> 28:28.952
I've got to get home to that good pie.

28:31.640 --> 28:33.551
Just grab the handrail there.

28:34.360 --> 28:35.873
Welcome to my office.

28:36.400 --> 28:38.197
Sender number KD113B.

28:39.400 --> 28:42.039
Just like all the rest of them, but is mine.

28:43.560 --> 28:47.155
Did you ever think what you were doing
by invading another galaxy?

28:47.400 --> 28:48.958
It wasn't an invasion.

28:50.680 --> 28:53.194
Here was this galaxy,
minding its own business.

28:53.280 --> 28:55.748
Perhaps a galaxy where war
no longer exists.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.552
People all live in harmony.

28:59.240 --> 29:01.708
Things don't go around
with such whizzings.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.593
You're shaking. Why?

29:11.320 --> 29:14.312
Because I've wanted to kiss you
from the first moment I saw you.

29:14.400 --> 29:15.310
What?

29:15.600 --> 29:18.751
You looked so beautiful and vulnerable,
then you started rhyming...

29:18.840 --> 29:21.718
...and doing all that talking
and singing and stuff and...

29:21.800 --> 29:26.510
I just wanted to use everything I know
about radar astronomy to protect you.

29:28.800 --> 29:30.756
Would you mind if I kissed you?

29:31.640 --> 29:32.834
Does it hurt?

29:35.000 --> 29:36.479
Not the way I do it.

32:01.240 --> 32:05.153
I have never felt anything like that
in my entire life.

32:10.400 --> 32:13.472
Do I now have to eat the chocolate
from Pennsylvania?

32:16.400 --> 32:18.960
Listen, I think we'd better get out of here.

32:20.080 --> 32:23.470
Are you sure you've told me everything
about the transmission?

32:23.600 --> 32:27.673
I think so. But perhaps we should
explore it a little further.

32:29.400 --> 32:30.799
I'd better take you home.

32:30.880 --> 32:33.553
No, thas too far.
We must go to your place.

32:35.280 --> 32:37.840
- Are you feeling what I'm feeling?
- More.

32:40.240 --> 32:41.434
I'm dreaming.

32:44.640 --> 32:46.198
"Life could be a dream

32:46.960 --> 32:48.029
"Sha-boom"

32:48.560 --> 32:50.198
As your great poet says.

32:57.480 --> 32:59.436
Welcome to the Mills residence.

33:02.320 --> 33:03.799
What is this?

33:04.680 --> 33:05.795
Hats.

33:05.880 --> 33:09.270
This one is a collector's item.
Actually belonged to Jimmy Durante.

33:09.600 --> 33:10.396
Who?

33:12.720 --> 33:15.109
"Goodnight Mrs. Calabash,
wherever you are."

33:17.080 --> 33:19.355
He was a song and dance man
in the movies.

33:19.440 --> 33:22.989
Come on in, this is the palace.
Help yourself. Sit down. Steal an ashtray.

33:23.080 --> 33:25.719
I have to go check on Jessie.
Please don't leave...

33:25.800 --> 33:29.998
...or otherwise I'll be forced to crawl up
under my bed and suck dust forever.

33:31.160 --> 33:32.798
So whas going on here?

33:33.360 --> 33:37.069
Could it be that he really doesn't know
how he made the transmission?

33:37.160 --> 33:38.673
- Whas that?
- Canine.

33:38.880 --> 33:40.438
Highly revered on chis planec.

33:40.520 --> 33:42.795
Usually found
in che company of fire hydrancs.

33:42.880 --> 33:44.871
Now look, Dr. Sceve's lying.

33:45.120 --> 33:46.348
Don'c leave him alone.

33:46.440 --> 33:48.874
But he doesn't even care
about that anymore.

33:48.960 --> 33:50.996
Didn't you see during that kissing thing?

33:51.080 --> 33:53.548
His skin got hot and his heartbeat went up.

33:53.640 --> 33:56.552
And suddenly there was
a lot more of him down there.

33:56.880 --> 33:58.029
Ic's an acc.

33:58.320 --> 34:00.959
Governmenc cypes on chis planec
are crained co lie.

34:01.040 --> 34:04.077
Go find him. He may be burning papers
righc chis minuce/

34:04.560 --> 34:05.834
Oh, God!

34:13.440 --> 34:15.192
She's beautiful, isn't she?

34:16.199 --> 34:17.315
Who is she?

34:17.480 --> 34:18.993
My daughter, Jessie.

34:19.719 --> 34:20.630
Short.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.672
Short? She's only 13.

34:23.480 --> 34:24.356
Thirteen?

34:25.639 --> 34:27.197
How old does she look?

34:27.520 --> 34:30.478
Six, seven hundred, just short.

34:40.080 --> 34:41.717
Why don't we go in here?

34:42.800 --> 34:43.789
My bedroom?

34:43.880 --> 34:47.395
Well, you said you wanted to talk.
Why go all the way downstairs?

34:47.520 --> 34:49.397
Say, do you think I'm a billionaire?

34:49.480 --> 34:53.473
Or somebody on television or somebody
who's really important or something?

34:53.560 --> 34:55.312
You're Steven Mills, Ph.D.

34:55.440 --> 34:58.238
A very obscure physicist
who makes $25,000 a year.

34:59.320 --> 35:01.151
And you still want to go in here?

35:01.240 --> 35:02.229
Yowza.

35:03.240 --> 35:04.150
Yowza?

35:07.320 --> 35:08.719
You make me laugh.

35:08.840 --> 35:12.674
I mean, you're the first person that has
really made me laugh since...

35:15.480 --> 35:19.712
Look, if we do go in there, you know,
I might probably want to do more kissing.

35:20.680 --> 35:24.559
Surely. It was very pleasant.
But I hope thas not all you want to do.

35:41.280 --> 35:42.429
Remember me?

36:15.400 --> 36:16.879
You're so wonderful.

36:17.520 --> 36:20.592
You're funny, you're intelligent
and you understand my work...

36:20.680 --> 36:22.432
...and now you want to have sex.

36:22.520 --> 36:23.873
I wanna have sex?

36:24.520 --> 36:25.430
Don't you?

36:25.520 --> 36:26.475
Do you?

36:26.880 --> 36:27.790
Yes!

36:28.480 --> 36:31.677
Well, I do, too.
As soon as I find out what it is.

36:36.320 --> 36:38.709
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Of course.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.274
What is sex?

36:54.160 --> 36:57.357
- Whac?
- "What?" You heard what I said.

36:57.760 --> 36:58.909
What is sex?

36:59.920 --> 37:03.833
Give me a second.
One second. Take a look ac chis.

37:16.120 --> 37:17.030
Deleted.

37:17.120 --> 37:18.314
What good is deleted?

37:18.400 --> 37:23.394
Now, don'c gec exciced. Jusc a second.
One liccle second. Here ic is.

37:23.560 --> 37:25.152
Your penis is a weapon.

37:25.880 --> 37:27.393
Jusc like your rifle.

37:27.600 --> 37:30.990
The milicary expeccs you co procecc ic
and keep ic dry.

37:31.600 --> 37:34.160
All righc, men, if you'll open your manuals.

37:34.280 --> 37:36.475
- What? Is that it?
- Take ic easy.

37:36.840 --> 37:38.751
Here's someching else.

37:43.200 --> 37:45.634
What does this mean, Debbie Does Dallas?

37:48.160 --> 37:49.798
Debbie Does Des Moines.

37:52.040 --> 37:53.473
Debbie Does Düsseldorf.

37:53.560 --> 37:55.232
Busy girl, that Debbie.

37:56.200 --> 37:57.474
Whas this?

38:06.640 --> 38:08.073
Look behind you.

38:15.440 --> 38:17.192
I can do that. I guess.

38:19.080 --> 38:20.877
I don't believe it.

38:25.920 --> 38:27.478
Why, chac's disguscing.

38:27.720 --> 38:29.392
I can't, that right there.

38:31.600 --> 38:34.478
Look, thas the most weirdest thing
I've ever seen.

38:34.560 --> 38:36.915
Thac's why we gave ic up 3,000 years ago.

38:47.440 --> 38:48.793
You think I could do that?

38:48.880 --> 38:52.156
Sure. Excepc for fuel
you're human inside and ouc.

38:52.280 --> 38:53.793
Buc do you wanc co?

38:55.120 --> 38:56.838
The kissing wasn't so bad.

39:00.760 --> 39:02.512
You're noc leaving me here/

39:02.920 --> 39:03.830
Yes, I am.

39:03.920 --> 39:08.232
I have been ordered co scay wich you
ac all cimes, co observe everyching you do/

39:08.600 --> 39:09.669
Forget it.

39:11.920 --> 39:12.796
Bicch/

39:45.760 --> 39:48.274
My God, you're beautiful.

41:17.080 --> 41:18.479
Are you all right?

41:19.880 --> 41:21.359
Yes, don't stop.

41:36.600 --> 41:37.919
Do you see...

41:47.840 --> 41:51.753
Dr. Steve, that was so wonderful.

41:52.560 --> 41:56.838
I feel like I've been hit by a train.

41:58.240 --> 42:01.312
And I don't think you need to call me
Dr. Steve anymore.

42:02.440 --> 42:06.274
Steve, you're so stupid. We could have
been doing this the whole time.

42:07.160 --> 42:08.878
We only met three hours ago.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.916
I know. What took you so long?

42:11.400 --> 42:12.913
Do others know about this?

42:13.000 --> 42:15.514
About us? I don't see how they could.

42:16.720 --> 42:18.278
No, about making love.

42:19.000 --> 42:23.312
You could become very famous if
others in the world knew you could do this.

42:23.400 --> 42:24.628
- Really?
- Yes.

42:25.800 --> 42:28.872
Didn't think I did it any differently
than anybody else.

42:29.240 --> 42:31.117
You mean everybody does this?

42:32.680 --> 42:34.830
Think of all the energy produced.

42:34.920 --> 42:39.152
Properly channelled that energy could
propel half your people out of the galaxy.

42:41.600 --> 42:43.670
We did some computer runs in the lab...

42:43.760 --> 42:46.558
...and figured if we could harness
the energy output from...

42:46.640 --> 42:50.918
...the male members of the Sheen family
we could put the state of Illinois on Pluto.

42:54.240 --> 42:56.708
I really don't think I can
do this again so soon.

42:56.800 --> 42:58.119
Yes, you can.

43:00.400 --> 43:01.594
- Celeste?
- What?

43:02.120 --> 43:03.394
Celeste, why me?

43:06.760 --> 43:08.512
Because you're sensitive...

43:09.120 --> 43:10.951
...and you're an outsider...

43:11.320 --> 43:14.073
...and you worked so hard
to get through M.I. T...

43:14.600 --> 43:17.592
...and you have two Ph.D.'s
and a delightful innocence.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.230
Just all the qualities of a dreamer.

43:22.440 --> 43:25.512
I know you had some really bad luck
five years ago when...

43:25.600 --> 43:28.478
...your wife died and left you
with a daughter, Jessie, 13.

43:29.200 --> 43:30.872
Thas who the short person was.

43:30.960 --> 43:33.713
Wait a minute.
Where'd you get all those details?

43:35.400 --> 43:37.277
I can read it. In your eyes.

44:16.360 --> 44:17.793
Thas kiďs stuff.

44:20.160 --> 44:21.479
This is no help.

45:38.200 --> 45:41.033
Whiceside, I'm here co spend

45:47.080 --> 45:50.038

45:50.400 --> 45:52.630
"Did you ever have che feeling

45:52.720 --> 45:54.950

46:21.440 --> 46:24.318
Whiceside, I love ya. I love ya.

46:48.040 --> 46:50.156
Dave, bon appétit.

47:03.960 --> 47:06.952
Dave, how are you
and your 1,000 fleas this morning?

47:14.600 --> 47:15.828
Are you okay?

47:16.320 --> 47:17.514
Yes, I'm okay.

47:19.880 --> 47:23.873
Jessie, Celeste.
Celeste, my daughter, Jessie.

47:24.800 --> 47:25.755
I know.

47:26.560 --> 47:27.879
You stayed here?

47:28.600 --> 47:30.079
Just overnight.

47:31.200 --> 47:32.269
But dad...

47:33.280 --> 47:34.713
...thas fabulous.

47:35.120 --> 47:36.235
I gotta go.

47:36.440 --> 47:38.078
Be true to your school.

47:41.480 --> 47:43.391
Happy short person. Daughter.

47:45.440 --> 47:47.317
Almost as happy as her old man.

47:47.400 --> 47:48.549
Who is that?

47:49.200 --> 47:50.076
Me.

47:51.360 --> 47:52.873
Yes, I am happy, too.

47:53.720 --> 47:54.789
I think...

47:55.720 --> 47:56.516
Yes?

47:57.480 --> 47:59.948
Will I scare you if I tell you I love you?

48:00.080 --> 48:02.150
Not unless you hit me at the same time.

48:02.240 --> 48:03.116
I'm serious.

48:03.200 --> 48:04.315
So am I.

48:04.400 --> 48:06.675
Then les go away.
Les go to San Francisco.

48:06.760 --> 48:09.832
- Or Vancouver? Or Anchorage?
- No, I have to leave tonight.

48:09.920 --> 48:11.956
Leave? Where you going?

48:12.840 --> 48:13.670
Home.

48:14.200 --> 48:15.428
To the Netherlands?

48:15.520 --> 48:18.592
You can call it Holland now.
I know what you mean. Yes.

48:21.680 --> 48:23.352
When are you going to be back?

48:23.440 --> 48:25.158
No, I'm never coming back.

48:30.040 --> 48:33.999
Never coming back? Why?
Why can't you ever come back?

48:34.560 --> 48:35.959
- Well l...
- Celeste.

48:36.040 --> 48:39.191
I hate to sound desperate,
but this news makes me sound desperate.

48:39.280 --> 48:41.999
I'm desperate. Celeste,
I know this is sudden...

48:42.080 --> 48:45.231
...but you're the most incredible thing
thas ever happened to me.

48:45.320 --> 48:48.676
I look in your face
and I can't believe what I feel for you.

48:49.320 --> 48:53.677
I'm hopelessly, insanely, out of my mind
in love with you. I can't let you go.

48:54.040 --> 48:55.996
Walk out of my life. I mean, I can't.

48:56.080 --> 48:58.799
Not now, not ever.
Without you there is no life.

48:59.200 --> 48:59.996
And?

49:00.680 --> 49:02.079
Will you marry me?

49:03.000 --> 49:03.910
Marry you?

49:04.000 --> 49:05.194
Yes. Please.

49:06.800 --> 49:08.677
This is a strange development.

49:08.880 --> 49:10.711
I know is sudden and quick and all.

49:10.800 --> 49:13.519
Not if you consider
I've been waiting five years for you.

49:13.600 --> 49:16.797
You see, before I met you
all I could think about was science.

49:16.920 --> 49:20.196
Now I can't even think about that anymore.
All I care about is you.

49:20.280 --> 49:22.271
Your eyes, your skin, your hair, your face.

49:22.360 --> 49:25.796
Do you think you could think
about science if we got married?

49:27.440 --> 49:31.479
If only I knew you were going to be
with me and you weren't going anywhere.

49:33.440 --> 49:36.750
I know is kinda sudden and everything,
so I'll tell you what.

49:36.840 --> 49:39.718
Why don't you take a short walk
and think about it?

49:40.480 --> 49:42.152
Okay, I'll think it over.

49:46.240 --> 49:48.629
You're not going out like that, are you?

49:49.200 --> 49:50.792
No. Of course not.

49:59.360 --> 50:02.193
She's an original. She's gotta say yes.

50:08.480 --> 50:12.598
You said you'd prepare me for 24 hours,
and here is only been 12 hours.

50:12.680 --> 50:15.513
You didn't tell me "spinach,"
you didn't tell me "kiss"...

50:15.600 --> 50:18.319
...you didn't tell me "have sex,"
and what about "marry"?

50:18.400 --> 50:20.630
Do things always happen
so fast on this planet?

50:20.720 --> 50:24.395
I don'c chink so. You can'c walk
down che screec looking like chis.

50:24.800 --> 50:26.870
Yes, I can. I know how this planet works.

50:26.960 --> 50:29.713
They'll think I'm starting
some kind of trend or something.

50:29.800 --> 50:33.873
I want you to contact the Council and
I want them here, I want them here now!

50:47.960 --> 50:48.790
Why here?

50:48.880 --> 50:52.395
They said chey needed an open field.
I found ic in che phone book.

50:52.800 --> 50:55.394
What goes on here?
Is it Christians and lions?

50:55.760 --> 50:57.159
Wrong cime frame.

51:02.600 --> 51:05.831
- Where is che cransmission?
- We're making progress, sir.

51:05.920 --> 51:09.037
Our gravicy has increased chreefold/

51:09.560 --> 51:11.790
Does che subjecc suspecc who you are?

51:12.680 --> 51:14.352
- No.
- Does che girl?

51:16.960 --> 51:20.350
She saw Celesce puc magazines inco me
and a dress come ouc.

51:20.640 --> 51:21.675
Kill her/

51:22.720 --> 51:27.430
Don't worry. She's nothing.
Short, inexperienced, just a daughter.

51:28.280 --> 51:30.589
- But we do have one problem.
- Yes?

51:31.600 --> 51:34.910
The subject says he will be
unable to think about science...

51:35.480 --> 51:37.118
...unless he marries me!

51:38.080 --> 51:39.399
Well, marry him/

51:40.800 --> 51:42.756
But we don't know what "marry" is.

51:45.040 --> 51:46.268
One momenc.

51:54.320 --> 51:56.914
Yes, che Mondschein 40 says
marriage is chis:

51:57.360 --> 52:00.511
"He goes off co fighc che Turks,
and you puc on a lock."

52:05.480 --> 52:08.677
Yes. Wrong cencury. Marriage is chis:

52:09.080 --> 52:12.117
"You cook and clean
and bring him marcinis."

52:12.880 --> 52:15.155
Wrong again? This is ridiculous.

52:18.400 --> 52:20.550
Yes, wrong decade. Too old fashioned.

52:21.960 --> 52:25.236
"The modern marriage:
There are no rules or responsibilicies.

52:25.320 --> 52:28.710
"Buc if he does someching wrong,
you can sec him on fire while he sleeps.

52:28.800 --> 52:32.270
"And go on a calk show where
everyone will forgive you and love you."

52:32.360 --> 52:35.318
There's only one drawback,
you'll have co have more sex.

52:35.600 --> 52:36.749
I'll do it.

52:36.840 --> 52:38.159
Immediacely.

52:39.080 --> 52:44.074
Yes, sir. I know tomorrow's the last day
the reflectors are in line for 19 months.

52:44.880 --> 52:46.472
What if there is no lightning?

52:46.560 --> 52:48.152
We will provide che lighcning.

52:48.240 --> 52:52.313
Jusc keep chac man fed
and keep his feec clean.

52:53.120 --> 52:54.030
You're fading.

52:54.120 --> 52:57.749
Yes, I know, ic's our gravicy.
Now remember, you are our lasc hope.

52:57.960 --> 53:01.714
If we don'c gec chac cransmission from him,
our planec is doomed.

53:05.000 --> 53:06.149
Yes, sir.

53:11.040 --> 53:14.794
But daddy, this is so quick.
I mean, you only met her last night.

53:14.880 --> 53:16.871
It was the same with your mother.

53:16.960 --> 53:20.748
- At least with mom you waited a week.
- Your mother and I knew on the first night.

53:20.840 --> 53:23.274
Are you crazy? You don't know
a thing about her.

53:23.360 --> 53:26.989
- I know all I need to know.
- I've already gone through this, Uncle Ron.

53:27.080 --> 53:28.638
She's after your money!

53:28.720 --> 53:32.395
Ron, I don't even have a ball of lint
and a lead slug to rub together.

53:32.480 --> 53:34.118
She's got a trust fund.

53:34.280 --> 53:35.793
She has a trust fund?

53:38.160 --> 53:41.232
You know, I don't get it.
Why does this happen to you?

53:42.560 --> 53:45.028
I know! Citizenship!
She wants citizenship.

53:45.120 --> 53:48.510
She wants to take jobs away from
Americans and give 'em to Dutch people!

53:48.600 --> 53:50.397
Yeah, thas why she's here.

53:51.320 --> 53:52.719
But is so unfair.

53:52.960 --> 53:54.712
I mean, you know...

53:55.080 --> 53:58.516
Is my own brother marrying
the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.

53:58.600 --> 54:00.352
And he met her at my apartment.

54:01.360 --> 54:03.316
Ron, I appreciate your concern.

54:03.520 --> 54:05.192
This is something I really want.

54:05.280 --> 54:08.750
Haven't you wanted something so much
that nothing else mattered?

54:08.960 --> 54:10.916
Is your wedding, I'm gonna tell you.

54:11.000 --> 54:14.276
There's only one woman in the world
that I will ever marry.

54:16.440 --> 54:18.317
Princess Stephanie of Monaco.

54:18.960 --> 54:19.915
Really?

54:20.680 --> 54:24.309
I never knew you had a thing for her.
What makes her the lucky lady?

54:24.840 --> 54:27.479
Because she's the most perfect
woman in the world.

54:27.560 --> 54:29.278
She'd have nothing to do with me.

54:29.360 --> 54:32.796
Ron, brush up on your French lessons
and your tennis, maybe ill happen.

54:32.880 --> 54:36.793
But right now I'm going to marry
my Princess Stephanie. So wish me luck.

54:37.400 --> 54:39.470
You've had too much luck already.

54:42.480 --> 54:45.153
Where did she get a wedding dress
on two hours notice?

54:45.240 --> 54:48.437
Does she just carry one around with her,
in case of emergencies?

54:48.520 --> 54:51.956
I hope so. Now would you go downstairs
and please be best man?

54:53.040 --> 54:55.952
- Uncle Ron, go!
- You wanna see my date? She's 6 foot 2.

54:59.520 --> 55:00.396
Okay.

55:01.520 --> 55:03.431
Go and tell Celeste is time.

55:11.920 --> 55:13.672
I'll have to leave you on the chair.

55:13.760 --> 55:15.159
Can'c you wear me?

55:15.440 --> 55:17.112
No, I'd look too strange.

55:17.560 --> 55:18.754
I'm so hungry.

55:18.840 --> 55:21.274
Good ching we scopped
ac che hardware score.

55:22.000 --> 55:25.390
D-cells. Primicive, buc nucricious.

55:44.760 --> 55:46.398
- Dad, she ate batteries!
- What?

55:46.480 --> 55:49.631
She took three "D" batteries
out of a paper bag and ate them.

55:49.720 --> 55:51.950
She flattened them
like a Tootsie Roll wrapper.

55:52.040 --> 55:55.271
And she was talking to
someone who wasn't even in the room.

55:57.840 --> 56:00.035
I love you more than anyone else
in the world.

56:00.120 --> 56:03.795
- Nothing's going to come between us.
- Daddy, she ate batteries.

56:04.680 --> 56:07.148
Jessie, I want you to stop this right now.

57:23.360 --> 57:25.078
Back off, Alpo breach.

57:53.360 --> 57:54.759
Dearly beloved...

57:55.600 --> 57:58.433

but I can tell she has love for Steve...

58:05.080 --> 58:07.355
...who I've also known for eight minutes.

58:07.560 --> 58:09.710
You're digging your own grave, Fido.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.070
And do you Celesce van Marcin...

58:12.440 --> 58:13.919

- I do.
- I now pronounce you man and wife.

58:41.560 --> 58:44.518
"I'm looking over my dead dog Rover"

58:44.600 --> 58:47.398
- Get that dog down!
- You lefc me alone again/

58:47.480 --> 58:49.038
I was getting married!

58:49.680 --> 58:50.669
Honey!

58:51.320 --> 58:52.548
What happened?

58:53.040 --> 58:56.828
Maybe is a Dutch custom. They say
"I do," bolt for the lawn and start digging.

58:56.920 --> 58:58.797
Maybe she's planting tulip bulbs.

58:58.880 --> 59:02.236
Honey, how on earth
did Dave get up there! Look!

59:02.360 --> 59:03.918
Dave! Don't move!

59:05.360 --> 59:07.396
Volunteers! Jeff, Woody!

59:14.640 --> 59:16.710
May I be the first to kiss the bride?

59:16.800 --> 59:17.755
Sure.

59:26.760 --> 59:27.988
I got him!

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.552
Where'd you get this dress?

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.788
Is him! Quick, dad, the brush!

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:20.674
I'm coming. Here it is. I've got it here.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.319
The brush.

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:24.239
Okay. Easy.

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.439
My God, you look beautiful.

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.590
Thanks, dad. I hope he likes me.

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.679
I hope you like him.

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.431
Hi. I'm Fred. The date.

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:46.478
These are for you, doll.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:48.828
Thank you.

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.238
I'm Steve, Jessie's dad.

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.717
- This is Mrs. Mills.
- Nice to meet you.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.028
Mouth jewellery.

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.753
Right, my braces.

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.791
My wife's from Holland, so...

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:06.678
You wore flats. Great.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:11.953
Have a great time.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.871
She'll be safe with me, sir.

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:17.196
Bye.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.871
Did that kid look shifty to you?

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.956
Hadn't you better get back to work now?

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:24.918
What? You gotta be kidding,
on our wedding night?

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:29.115
I don't think so.

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.313
God, I love you!

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:51.876

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:08.749

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:29.035

We can'c afford co wasce
billions and billions of dollars.

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:34.878
Have I made myself clear, Meachead?

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:36.109
Yes. I...

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.349

Yes, sir.

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.033

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:53.755

Now we've goc co gec Dr. Sceve

You're right. He should have no excuses
not to work.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:21.358
Hands on che wheel/

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:55.039

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.951
$416.80.

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:46.669
Whas this?

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.269
Is a diamond.

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:52.148
I'm sorry, we don't take diamonds
at this branch. Money only.

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.830
Haven't you got anything smaller?

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.515
What did I just do?

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:25.673
Ic's called a sneeze. From che flour.
Buc only humans are supposed co do ic.

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.318
Whac did ic feel like?

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.275
Very funny.

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:34.712
Very good. Very liberating.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.113
This is my house.

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:43.711
I actually had a good time.
Maybe we can do it again sometime.

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.950
Maybe next time we can even dance.

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:48.632
- I am starving.
- Okay.

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.159
Just what I needed.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.911
I could have a banquet down this block.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.513
We've goc work co do.

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:21.155
All right.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:51.391
Did you see Uncle Ron's new invention?

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:54.995
Is an all-snap shirt where
the snaps look like buttons. Great?

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.677
Except they rust in the wash.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:01.116
- Good morning, dear.
- Good morning.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:04.636
- I made you breakfast, my family.
- So thas what you've been up to?

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.994
Did you sleep well?

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:07.716
Yes.

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:08.869
Did you?

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:15.189
Hello.

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:17.509
Dr. Budlong.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.149
How are you?

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:21.233
Fine. Thank you.

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:25.395
No, I don't know Dr. Sagan personally.

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:29.680
The Presidens Most Secret
None More Secret?

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:39.518
I've been thinking, too.

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:42.558
About the explosion
and the damage and everything.

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:47.230
Really? You mean it?

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:49.433
When can I start back?

01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:53.315
No, not today. Today's my honeymoon.

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:56.514
A foreign gal.

01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:58.273
She's a head-spinner.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:01.635
Fine.

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:08.959
Thank you. Surely you and Skippy
must remember from your own experience.

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:12.678
This is Mrs. Mills. Ignore my husband
on anything but science.

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:15.433
He'll be there in 15 minutes.
Maybe less. Yes, bye.

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:19.309
Sweetie, wait a minute. I don't wanna
go to work today. Is our honeymoon.

01:08:19.399 --> 01:08:21.118
I wanna clean the place up for you.

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.997
I'll clean the house so you don't see a dust.

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:25.640
I'm Dutch. Did you ever see
a dirty street in Hague?

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:27.278
We are ready to clean.

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:31.350
Great, les do it together.
And we can watch my Durante tapes.

01:08:31.439 --> 01:08:33.908
Les put an end
to this silly argument right now.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.389
I'll arm-wrestle you for it. Winner cleans.

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:38.595
You sure you really want to do this?

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:39.669
Come on.

01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:45.676
One, two, three. Okay, lady wins.
Now les eat right up and get to work.

01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:49.435
Thas quite a forearm you've got there.

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:50.919
And remember the thrust.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.435
Four hundred megawatts and lightning
isn't enough to go extragalactic.

01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:59.518
- Whas this?
- Your martini. Would you like one, dear?

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:00.794
No, thank you.

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:07.919
And finally your turkey.

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:10.354
Dig right in.

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:14.678
Eat fast, solve all your problems,
and fulfil yourself. I'll make the beds.

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:20.749
Quite a spread.

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:23.434
Daddy, don't you think
this is pretty strange?

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:25.796
Your stepmother's just full of surprises.

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:27.359
I know how happy you are...

01:09:27.439 --> 01:09:31.228
...and I wouldn't do anything in the world
to get in the way of that happiness.

01:09:31.319 --> 01:09:33.834
- But last night, after my date...
- Your date?

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.228
How'd your date go?

01:09:35.319 --> 01:09:38.392
Fine, but Dad, I saw her drink
the battery juice from your Honda.

01:09:38.479 --> 01:09:39.196
Jessie!

01:09:39.279 --> 01:09:42.955
Not only that, I saw her lift
a burning hot pan with her bare hands!

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.068
Now I wish I didn't have to go to the lab.

01:09:46.399 --> 01:09:47.799
- Your new mother...
- Stepmother!

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:50.029
Stepmother loves you very much.

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:52.509
She's concerned that she won't fit in
around here.

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.272
She knows there'll be problems...

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:58.399
Dad, if the car won't start, will you
at least give me the benefit of the doubt?

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:09.553
Nothing happened, Jess.
You must have dreamed it.

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:18.117
- Bye.
- Not you.

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:21.550
We do che resc of che house in 14 seconds.

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:24.757
Then Council provides che lighcning.
He does che cransmission...

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:27.149
...and we head che 92 lighc years home.

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:43.272
Setty Lab. This is Mills.

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:46.279
Dad, come home right away.
The house is on fire.

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:52.878
You can't leave now! What if we get rain?

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:55.836
Jessie!

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.229
Stay away from me.

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.117
No, is not what you think.

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:09.433
You are an alien!

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.355
Oh, my God!

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:26.794
And you/

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:29.513
Quiec/

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:35.271
- Bag, let her down!
- Noc yec.

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.873
What do you want?

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:39.156
We're from Co-sign into the Eighth.

01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:42.038
Ninety-two light years
and two solar systems away.

01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:46.389
Your father penetrated our atmosphere
with a radar beam nine days ago.

01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:50.597
We must duplicate that transmission
in 12 hours...

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.674
...or our civilisation will be destroyed.

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:57.310
Is that why you're here?
But he doesn't know how he did it!

01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:59.990
- We assume thas a lie.
- No, is not.

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.757
You should know him well enough
to know he doesn't lie.

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:07.432
Could that be the truth?
Could it be it was just an accident?

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:10.239
No/ The ceenager is lying, coo.

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.758
No, I don't think so.

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:15.714
We have to find out
or we'll never be able to leave.

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:18.268
Leave? But what about my father?

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:22.434
He loves you. For the first time
in five years he loves someone.

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:25.838
You're gonna kill that in him.
He'll never recover.

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:28.838
Celesce doesn'c care. Righc, Celesce?

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:30.708
Righc, Celesce?

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:32.469
Right.

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.270
If you don't say anything,
we'll let you down.

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:38.554
No, we won'c/

01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.871
I'm in charge of this mission.

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:43.835
Will you not tell your father
until we've gone?

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.911
Yes, just don't hurt him.

01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:52.833
- Let her down.
- Celesce/

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:54.319
Let her down!

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:58.797
That wasn't necessary.

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.392
Give the dog back his bark.

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:06.796
Celesce, your accicude sucks.

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:12.949
- Ciao, baby.
- Whas this about a fire?

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:15.550
Daddy!

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:17.710
You said there was a fire!
Whas going on?

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:20.030
I had to say there was a fire.
What was I to say?

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:22.031
"The living room's spotless, come home."

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:23.951
Why did you call me? Why did you lie?

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:27.510
I had to. Daddy, you married a person
from another planet.

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:29.272
Celeste doesn't come from Holland.

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:32.830
She comes from a place 92 light years
and two solar systems away.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.116
Not again. You're going in for counselling.

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:39.239
She does. She took away Dave's bark
and put me on the ceiling for ten minutes.

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.396
Celeste is not from another planet.

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:46.271
Your stepmother is not an alien.

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:50.710
I mean, please, this is a fantasy.
Don't you think I know aliens?

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:52.992
Is my business to know.

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:55.151
Why do we never see her eat or sleep?

01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:58.710
And how come we suddenly get
a new living room in one afternoon?

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:02.028
And inside that bag there's a horrible eye.

01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:06.073
Just like why my car wouldn't start
this morning?

01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:07.872
Just look inside.

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.754
I come home from the lab
to look in a purse.

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:20.951
Lipstick. Passion pink.

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:25.680
Mascara. Unusual for a purse, isn't it?

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:29.792
Q-tips. An eye!

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:31.632
Jessie, there's no eye in here.

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.553
She made it disappear.
There was one in there.

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:37.718
And she did lift up the bacon
without a potholder.

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:40.760
And what about all that food
she cooked for breakfast?

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:43.115
You don't have an answer
and you won't believe me.

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:46.988
And she's gonna be gone in 12 hours,
and why won't you listen to me?

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:49.634
Now, honey, come on. Jessie, come here.

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:54.311
Jessie, where are you going?

01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:00.078
Come back here, Jessie.

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:02.955
Get off the street!

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:07.112
Jessie, you bring that bike back here now!
Hey, come on.

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:10.319
- Stop!
- Whas wrong?

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:14.435
Come on!

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:42.559
I'm sorry, I didn't see her. Is she all right?

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:44.395
She's okay.

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:45.993
I didn't see her.

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:47.388
Is all right.

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:58.669
You gave yourself away to save my life.

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:17.833
I'll be right back.

01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:36.912
Do you really have to go?

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:41.390
Is the same on both our planets.

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:45.398
Just when you get to know someone
they have to leave.

01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:49.999
My mom, I mean, my first mom,
had to leave, too.

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:55.638
I know you have to go.
This isn't your home. I understand that.

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:01.436
Can you at least wait till morning?

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:04.709
I'll try.

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:40.958
Where's your spaceship?

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:44.598
Behind your moon, Steve.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.274
What do you do up there?

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:49.796
Meditate? Plan how to break hearts?
If you know what they are.

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:56.391
We are where you will be in 55 centuries.
If you make it.

01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.670
I'm 1,296 years old.

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:04.268
We reproduce by synthesis in a petri dish.

01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:09.598
We use 104 percent of our brain capacity
as opposed to your 36 percent.

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:14.194
Our lives are spent in perfect harmony...

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:19.071
...improving our civilisation with none of
the erratic highs and lows you have here.

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:21.430
I see. Sort of like Switzerland.

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:24.751
Why do you reproduce in a petri dish?

01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:27.434
We learned that sex was
inefficient and messy.

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:29.750
So you got rid of it, just like that?

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:32.874
I must admit, we were a little hasty
on that one.

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:36.157
You mean I married a virgin?
Mother would be proud.

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:42.160
Don't you ever do stuff like go on vacation?

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:43.515
Sure we do.

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:45.273
What do you do on vacation?

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:46.270
Math.

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:49.272
What do you do to have fun?

01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:50.949
Graphs.

01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:56.440
We go to warm places together
and hold hands.

01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:02.111
Is too bad you don't eat food.

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:04.760
You might find it could be
quite pleasurable.

01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:06.793
You get pleasure out of food?

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:08.393
- Here.
- No, thank you.

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:11.279
If you want my secrets
you'll eat my sandwich.

01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:18.389
Chew!

01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:34.954
This is fun. What is it?

01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:39.711
Ham and cheese on rye with mayo.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.595
And I love the way it feels
against the roof of my mouth...

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:47.031
...and the sides of my tongue.

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.553
This is fun.

01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:50.593
Here, wash it down.

01:19:58.280 --> 01:19:59.952
This makes me smile, too.

01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:03.198
Seagram's Scotch Whiskey.

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:08.149
Celeste?

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.713
Did you ever like me?

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:15.716
Steve, of course I did. I do.

01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:17.918
It wasn't just physics?

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:22.952
No. If I were an Earth person
I would do exactly what we did.

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:27.348
- It might have taken a little longer, but...
- Then why can't you stay?

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:30.314
I just can't.

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:32.596
What if I never sent
the transmission again?

01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:35.433
Then nobody would be able
to use it against you ever.

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:38.960
Unfortunately thas not the history
of your planet.

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:42.157
And if you don't do that transmission,
my planet will die.

01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:47.398
- Are you mad at me?
- Mad?

01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:51.308
I'm furious. I'm confused, I'm upset,
I'm frustrated, I'm furious!

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:54.677
You're everything I ever wanted
in a human and an extraterrestrial.

01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:57.558
If I send the transmission,
which I don't know how to do...

01:20:57.640 --> 01:20:59.278
...and save your planet, I lose you.

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:02.193
If I don't send it,
you stay but I kill a whole planet.

01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:04.996
But I'd make a lousy Earth person.

01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:07.640
I made way too much breakfast,
and the dog hates me.

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:10.473
The dog loves you. We all love you.

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:14.393
Don't you see, thas why is so hard.

01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:17.637
Thas why I'm so torn apart.

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.119
I feel like Durante.

01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:26.234
"Did you ever have the feeling
that you wanted to go

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:28.550
"Still had the feeling
that you wanted to stay

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.710
"Knew it was right wasn't wrong

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.392
"Go stay, stay go"

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:35.432
Thas exactly how I feel.

01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:37.153
You know this song?

01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:40.155
I feel just like you and Durante.

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:43.758
I don't wanna go, but I can't stay.

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:46.879
I feel only one way.

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:49.393
I want you to stay.

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:05.357
Boy, talk about being tied to your work.

01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:09.556
I spend my whole career trying to prove
there's life on other planets...

01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:11.517
...and when I find it, I marry it.

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:18.629
Lightning.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.353
You shocked me.

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:25.678
Static electricity.
The metal in Ron's snaps.

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:33.029
Snaps.

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.434
Ron's buttons.

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:37.157
The cage around the Klystron.

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.476
Thas the wild card! Come on.

01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:44.629
He knows.

01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:47.359
He's a true scientist.

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:51.274
You realise, of course, as soon as
we've made concacc we'll have co leave.

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:55.954
- I'm aware of that.
- Righc afcer we kill chem.

01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:58.799
- Kill them?

Whac do you call ic? Earch.

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:01.953
We're not killing anybody.

01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:04.315
We'll get what we need
and leave Earth as we found it.

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:06.516
I'm afraid noc.
We're wiping ouc everyching.

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:11.276
People, land mass, wacer.
The Council has cold me co cake care of ic.

01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:12.952
We're not going to do anything.

Come on, get up.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.115
Be careful.

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:14.079
Ron, ic's Celesce.

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:17.675

01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:23.069

Our physical relacionship

I need co calk co someone.
I need co calk co you.

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:34.989
About your physical relationship?

01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:40.875
Could you come co che lab, and we
could discuss chese maccers of che flesh?

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:45.351
The flesh? Yes, sure.
But, I mean, he's my brother.

Buc we don'c need co cell Sceve everyching.

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:53.153

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:57.196
I lefc my purse in che bedroom ac home.
Bye.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.072
This is terrible. What am I going to do?
He's my own brother!

01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:05.310
This is terrible. My own brother!

01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:07.628
And yet.

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:27.917
Where've you been all day?
This rain could stop at any minute.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.434
Grady, we need a conductor. A conductor.

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:33.395
Solid tin.

01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:36.750
Next year when they give out
that Nobel Prize...

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:39.195
...I'll be up there, and I'll tell them about...

01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:40.679
Steve, darling.

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:52.915
See what did it? Ronnie put his jacket
on the chair and it had brass buttons.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.319
It was a short circuit.

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:58.234
Electrical impulse bouncing between
the Klystron and the fried buttons.

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.788
It threw the power way beyond
400 megawatts!

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:06.152
Telescope's all set, Dr. Mills.

01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:08.959
You won't forget to tell Dr. Sagan
how helpful I've been?

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:10.473
Carl Sagan? Sure.

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:13.157
Now all we need is the lightning.

01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:15.710
Watch the monitors.
Thas where the action is.

01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:17.392
All right, put these on.

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:19.834
Put those on.

01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:22.359
Okay, set your attractors.

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:23.839
Set your attractors.

01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:26.751
Steve, I have to talk to you.

01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:28.230

I've got to. I want to kill myself.

01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:39.431
- I'm in love with your wife.
- What?

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:41.158
Steve, the reflectors.

01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:43.069
Ready!

01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:04.515
Great! Nothing's changed here!

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:13.595
Daddy, look!

01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:14.795
I know!

01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:16.948
I'll be damned!

01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:24.634
We did it again!

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:25.789
Science!

01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:28.751
Steve, didn't you hear what I said?

01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:30.671
I am in love with your wife.

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:33.952
She's in love with me.
Is a whole thing. We gotta talk.

01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:36.314
Get rid of that bag.

01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:37.395
The bag?

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:39.550
That bag will destroy your planet.

01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:43.997
Babe, I love ya, we'll get rid of the bag.
I mean, whas in it?

01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:46.992
A little eyeliner, a little lipstick, a little eye.
