00:15.115 --> 00:17.082
Come in!

00:20.320 --> 00:22.254
- Drinks, madam.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.726
- Thank you, Crosby.

00:27.795 --> 00:30.128
Oh. Carnations.

00:30.197 --> 00:33.065
What woman doesn't love
the aroma of a funeral?

00:33.133 --> 00:36.468
Oh, ginger ale. How cosmopolitan.

00:36.537 --> 00:40.105
Do we have to go
to this thing tonight, Abe?

00:40.173 --> 00:42.307
- Oh, sweetie, we must.
- This dinner's our ticket

00:42.375 --> 00:44.309
- to expand into Canada.
- Yeah, but does it

00:44.311 --> 00:46.745
- have to be Toronto?
- The city's growing

00:46.814 --> 00:49.147
like a wildfire.
Amory Steel needs to be here.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.492
Besides, pumpkin, it's
only for a few days.

00:51.495 --> 00:52.617
Yeah, but it's hard

00:52.620 --> 00:55.253
to imagine a more boring city
filled with more boring people.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.122
- Well, then...

00:59.192 --> 01:01.026
...it's up to us
to show them how to live.

01:03.064 --> 01:05.597
- Now, now, tiger.
- What's the point

01:05.666 --> 01:08.367
of having beautiful things
if you can't show them off?

01:08.402 --> 01:11.103
- Not that I don't
love to make an entrance,

01:11.171 --> 01:13.271
but we shouldn't
keep your guests waiting.

01:13.274 --> 01:15.507
- Just one thing missing.

01:15.576 --> 01:18.077
- Oh?
- Pearls.

01:22.316 --> 01:24.650
- They're gone!
- What?

01:39.800 --> 01:41.800
- Keep your knickers on!

01:41.802 --> 01:45.337
- Mary?
- Flo! What are you doing here?

01:45.339 --> 01:48.006
- I have a life outside
of the morgue. Now, get in here

01:48.008 --> 01:51.043
before you ruin everything. - What
are you talking about? - Just do it!

01:56.884 --> 01:58.850
- What is going on?
- Mary!

01:58.919 --> 02:00.819
Keep your voice down.
He'll be here any second.

02:00.855 --> 02:02.888
- We don't want you to spook him.
- Who'll be here?

02:02.890 --> 02:04.990
- A suspect. Who else?

02:04.992 --> 02:06.871
We're pulling a little sting operation.

02:06.874 --> 02:07.860
In your own office?

02:07.895 --> 02:10.461
- We're gonna use the back door.
- He'll never know it's

02:10.464 --> 02:12.531
- a detective agency.
- And this place is <i> très</i> swanky.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.533
- What kind of a sting
operation is this?

02:14.601 --> 02:16.502
- Cheating husband.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.637
- I didn't think
you did matrimonial.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.640
- Well, things
are a little bit slow.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.675
- Why is Flo here?
- She's not a detective.

02:23.711 --> 02:26.211
- She's the bait.

02:26.213 --> 02:29.314
- This philanderer likes a real
woman, if you know what I mean.

02:31.618 --> 02:33.818
- Now the real question
is why are you here?

02:33.821 --> 02:37.222
- I need to speak with Frankie urgently.
- You could talk to me.

02:37.224 --> 02:40.526
- No, it's personal. It's not
about me, it's about Frankie.

02:40.561 --> 02:43.929
- Is everything OK?
- I don't know. I just need to see her.

02:43.931 --> 02:46.264
- OK. Well, she's
in The Ward at Quon's.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.700
Yeah, of course she is.

02:48.768 --> 02:51.002
- OK. Mary, it's time for you
to go. But if anything's wrong

02:51.005 --> 02:53.772
- anything - you tell me.
- I will. Don't worry.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.540
Good luck.

02:55.543 --> 02:57.409
- OK.

03:04.751 --> 03:08.120
- Well... hello there, handsome.

03:13.027 --> 03:15.727
- Oh, hello. I'm looking
for Frankie Drake.

03:17.797 --> 03:19.764
Thank you very much.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.700
Frank... ie?

03:21.768 --> 03:23.768
Oh.

03:23.771 --> 03:25.770
Fra... Oh, good lord!

03:25.773 --> 03:28.106
- Hi, Mary.
- Uh...

03:28.108 --> 03:31.042
What is going on?

03:31.045 --> 03:33.212
- Well, I'm quitting smoking.

03:33.247 --> 03:36.381
For good, this time.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.450
It's a Chinese treatment called cupping.

03:38.485 --> 03:41.386
- Oh. It looks like you've been

03:41.388 --> 03:43.055
attacked by an octopus.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.390
Ah... but never mind.

03:45.426 --> 03:48.994
Just... get dressed. You have a problem.

03:55.002 --> 03:58.136
Oh. Thank you, but I'm just
going to have regular tea

03:58.138 --> 04:00.239
for once.

04:00.274 --> 04:03.809
- You ever had green tea before?
- No...

04:03.844 --> 04:06.144
but I'm sure I'll love it.

04:06.146 --> 04:08.413
- So what's the problem?

04:08.449 --> 04:10.582
- This has a lot
of leaves in it.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.417
- I was referring to my problem.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.419
- Oh, right.

04:14.487 --> 04:16.488
A string of pearls was stolen last night

04:16.523 --> 04:19.091
- from the Crown Ascot Hotel.
- Really?

04:19.125 --> 04:21.125
- They were priceless.
- Who's the mark?

04:21.128 --> 04:23.028
- Abe Amory of
Amory Steel, Pittsburgh.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.096
- And he needs a little
outside help.

04:25.099 --> 04:26.283
Thanks for the tip, Mary.

04:26.286 --> 04:28.967
Oh, no. Frankie, you're the
last person he'd want to see.

04:31.138 --> 04:33.705
The thief left something
in place of the pearls.

04:33.741 --> 04:36.508
- You stole evidence?

04:36.510 --> 04:39.511
- I... borrowed.
- You could lose your job!

04:39.513 --> 04:42.080
- I know. My father is probably

04:42.148 --> 04:44.382
turning in his grave right now,
but this is important.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.118
- Why would your father care?

04:46.153 --> 04:47.185
- Well, he was a policeman.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.920
- Really? You never
told me that.

04:48.988 --> 04:51.189
- I didn't?
- No.

04:51.191 --> 04:54.659
- Oh, he was just a patrolman,
but a very good one. He may

04:54.662 --> 04:55.722
have even known your father.

04:55.725 --> 04:57.462
My father? What does
he have to do with this?

04:57.464 --> 05:01.399
- Do you know what that is?
- It's a feather.

05:01.402 --> 05:04.803
- Oh, Frankie, that's
a drake feather.

05:04.838 --> 05:08.006
Apparently this was your
father's calling card.

05:08.008 --> 05:10.275
- Calling card? Wait, how
do you know all of this?

05:10.311 --> 05:13.511
- Well, it's the talk of the station!
- What are you talking about?

05:13.514 --> 05:15.614
- The last time anyone
saw this feather

05:15.682 --> 05:17.882
was over 20 years ago,
when a shipment of gold bars

05:17.885 --> 05:20.285
was stolen on its way
to the Bank of Toronto.

05:20.353 --> 05:22.154
- My father was just
a small-time con-man.

05:22.189 --> 05:24.322
- Well apparently, at the time,

05:24.325 --> 05:26.491
the cops were convinced
that your father was behind it.

05:26.527 --> 05:29.227
But they could never pin it on him.

05:29.263 --> 05:31.763
Cops have long memories, Frankie.

05:31.765 --> 05:34.165
- So now they're looking at you.
- Me?! No, that's crazy!

05:34.168 --> 05:36.267
- Well, you know that,
and I know that,

05:36.270 --> 05:38.903
- but all anyone is saying...
- What? What is everyone saying?

05:38.906 --> 05:42.507
- The feather doesn't
fall far from the Drake.

05:58.324 --> 06:00.759
- You should've seen
the look on his face

06:00.827 --> 06:02.627
when I snapped a picture of him and Flo

06:02.695 --> 06:04.796
canoodling on the couch!

06:04.864 --> 06:07.065
Are you listening?

06:07.101 --> 06:09.668
- Yeah! You... you had cannoli.

06:09.736 --> 06:12.771
- Frankie, you had nothing
to do with that robbery,

06:12.839 --> 06:16.007
- so what's the point in worrying?
- The cops suspect me.

06:16.075 --> 06:18.143
Me! Can you believe it?

06:18.145 --> 06:20.946
- Well, did you steal them?

06:20.981 --> 06:24.048
Sorry, I had to ask.
Well, all we have to do

06:24.117 --> 06:26.017
is figure out what really happened

06:26.086 --> 06:28.052
and everything will be fine.
Piece of cake.

06:28.055 --> 06:31.356
We obviously know
it's a professional job.

06:31.425 --> 06:34.426
- The thief's gonna be
looking to fence those pearls.

06:34.494 --> 06:37.162
- Well, I'll ask around
with the usual suspects

06:37.230 --> 06:39.097
and see if they've
heard anything. And you?

06:39.099 --> 06:42.701
- I'm gonna have a chat
with an old family friend.

06:47.974 --> 06:50.308
Hello, Jack. It's been a while.

06:50.310 --> 06:52.310
- Frankie. I got your message.

06:52.378 --> 06:54.246
What's wrong?

06:54.281 --> 06:56.314
It's true.

06:56.383 --> 06:58.183
The feather was Ned's calling card.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.552
You've gotta understand, Frankie,

07:00.620 --> 07:02.921
there are some things your dad
didn't want you to know.

07:02.989 --> 07:05.290
- I'm sure he would make
an exception in this case.

07:07.161 --> 07:09.261
Tell me about the gold.

07:11.165 --> 07:13.531
- This was before you were born,

07:13.534 --> 07:15.867
and Ned was a different man back then.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.136
He heard about a shipment
of gold bars coming in

07:18.204 --> 07:20.405
from England, so we made a plan.

07:20.473 --> 07:22.207
- You robbed
an armoured carriage.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.609
- Right in the middle
of a snowstorm.

07:24.611 --> 07:28.012
God, you should have seen us,
all wrapped up, wearing these

07:28.015 --> 07:32.484
crazy ski goggles Ned found.
We cleaned it out.

07:32.552 --> 07:35.086
Left only the feather.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.822
- He always told me the feather
was just his good luck charm.

07:37.825 --> 07:40.892
- It was both.
- When your mom died,

07:40.960 --> 07:43.127
Ned couldn't risk
doing a job this big again.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.396
He had you to think about.

07:45.399 --> 07:48.467
The cops never could nail us.
It drove them crazy.

07:48.502 --> 07:51.135
- Which is why the police
were always so hard on him.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.238
Now it looks like I'm their target.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.573
Was the feather public knowledge?

07:55.576 --> 07:58.176
- No.
- So whoever knew

07:58.245 --> 08:00.879
about the pearls must have known
my father well. Someone like

08:00.947 --> 08:02.848
- his right-hand man.
- If I had snatched

08:02.916 --> 08:05.884
those pearls, I'd never
leave you to take the fall.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.986
- Well, someone else must've
known about the feather.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.854
Just tell me the truth, Jack.

08:09.857 --> 08:12.991
- Your dad and I...

08:13.059 --> 08:16.328
we had a little help, back in the day.

08:16.363 --> 08:18.396
- Jack. Let's make this quick.

08:18.432 --> 08:20.532
I'm supposed to be
at a constituency meeting.

08:20.534 --> 08:22.534
- Nice to see you too, Alderman.

08:22.536 --> 08:25.337
- Who's the broad?
- Morris Flynn,

08:25.372 --> 08:27.472
meet Frankie Drake.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.107
- Frankie?

08:29.109 --> 08:31.442
I didn't mean...

08:31.445 --> 08:34.880
- I don't know what to say.
- Yes, it is a day of surprises.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.813
For instance, I just
learned that my father

08:36.817 --> 08:38.683
was a master thief
and head of a criminal gang.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.885
- Yeah. Well, that's
all in the past now, Frankie.

08:40.921 --> 08:44.622
- Back in the day, Morris was the
best fence this side of the border.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.691
Pretty good training ground
for a politician.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.227
- A career financed by your
share of the gold, no doubt.

08:49.263 --> 08:51.763
- We all used it
to set ourselves up.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.731
I opened a printing business.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.567
Ned saved his share to take care of you.

08:55.569 --> 08:57.969
- So it was just
you two and my father?

08:57.971 --> 09:00.572
- That's not much of a gang.
- Well, there was Vinnie,

09:00.607 --> 09:03.041
God rest his soul. He died

09:03.076 --> 09:05.143
last year, traveling the world.

09:05.145 --> 09:08.346
- He bought shares in a steamer.
- But you didn't

09:08.382 --> 09:11.850
- call me here to reminisce.
- I'm sure you heard about

09:11.885 --> 09:13.785
the pearls that were stolen
from the Crown Ascot last night.

09:13.787 --> 09:17.422
- The thief left
a drake feather behind.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.324
- Which is going
to have the police

09:19.326 --> 09:21.326
knocking down my door
any minute. Yours will be next.

09:21.328 --> 09:24.563
- Well, tell her, Jack!
- We didn't do this.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.965
- If it wasn't you, then who?
- Who else knew about the feather?

09:26.967 --> 09:29.067
There must be someone else
from back then.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.136
- See, that's
the thing, Frankie.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.572
It's just us. There's no one else.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.346
- You think they're
telling you the truth?

09:41.348 --> 09:43.548
- It turns out Jack has been
lying to me my whole life.

09:43.584 --> 09:46.318
- But you don't think he'd
do anything to hurt you?

09:46.386 --> 09:48.152
- Nothing would surprise me.
- Well, I've checked

09:48.155 --> 09:50.622
with Toronto's shadier jewelers.
No one's prepared

09:50.624 --> 09:52.624
to handle anything
as hot as those pearls.

09:52.626 --> 09:56.294
- Maybe the thief is hanging onto them
until things quiet down. And either way,

09:56.330 --> 09:58.229
we have to figure out
how the theft was pulled off.

09:58.297 --> 10:00.665
- OK. Well, I'll talk
to the Crown Ascot employees

10:00.701 --> 10:02.567
and see if the Amory's
are traveling with any staff.

10:02.569 --> 10:04.436
The help always know more
than they let on.

10:04.471 --> 10:07.038
- How do I look?

10:07.040 --> 10:09.441
- Plain-ish.
- Perfect.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.652
- The claim is only $100 000,
but the pearls

10:20.720 --> 10:22.654
are worth much more.
But your company wouldn't...

10:22.722 --> 10:25.523
- Mr. Amory, we are well aware
of the value of your pearls,

10:25.525 --> 10:26.905
and Eastford Insurance is just as

10:26.908 --> 10:28.793
interested in getting
them back as you are.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.795
- Good.
- So to that extent,

10:30.797 --> 10:34.065
to your knowledge, who else knew
the safe's combination?

10:34.067 --> 10:37.068
- Just myself and my wife.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.937
- I see.

10:39.005 --> 10:40.872
- Like I said
to the police, nothing

10:40.874 --> 10:43.307
- out of the ordinary happened.
- Any maintenance happen

10:43.376 --> 10:45.309
- on the suite?
- Nothing was scheduled.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.245
- How about any room service
or deliveries?

10:47.313 --> 10:49.547
- Just the usual
comings and goings.

10:49.615 --> 10:52.884
Mostly flowers.
That woman loves flowers.

10:52.919 --> 10:55.486
- That's it?
- That's it.

10:55.489 --> 10:58.189
- Five bucks doesn't
get you much these days.

10:58.257 --> 11:00.592
I'll take that.

11:10.237 --> 11:14.038
- Oh, finally! Mrs. Amory's
in a lather about these.

11:14.041 --> 11:17.008
- The Mrs. sure does have
a lot of nice things.

11:17.076 --> 11:19.711
- If the lady didn't
throw them on the floor,

11:19.779 --> 11:21.612
they wouldn't need
to be endlessly cleaned.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.981
- I guess when you grew up
with people like us to help...

11:23.984 --> 11:26.184
- That woman wasn't
born to wealth...

11:26.252 --> 11:28.319
In a barn, maybe.

11:28.387 --> 11:31.489
- She married up?
- I believe the common parlance

11:31.557 --> 11:35.426
- is gold-digger.
- Ooh! Do tell!

11:35.495 --> 11:38.062
- The things that come out
of that woman's mouth...

11:40.067 --> 11:42.066
- Mrs. Amory was
shopping on Yonge Street

11:42.135 --> 11:44.335
most of the day. The afternoon I spent

11:44.404 --> 11:46.370
in business meetings.
We were getting ready

11:46.373 --> 11:49.373
for dinner when we discovered
the pearls were gone. The police

11:49.376 --> 11:51.642
dusted for fingerprints
but they didn't find any.

11:51.645 --> 11:53.978
- Except yours.
- Of course. And my wife's.

11:58.084 --> 12:00.485
- Were either of these flowers
delivered yesterday?

12:00.553 --> 12:04.222
- Uh... carnations just before
noon and later, the roses.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.891
- So there was a delivery man
in your room?

12:06.960 --> 12:09.561
- Well, the same man came twice.
- Rather average, I didn't pay him

12:09.629 --> 12:12.897
any attention.
-  Anyone else? - No. Well, not exactly.

12:12.933 --> 12:15.533
There was a window-washer outside.

12:15.602 --> 12:17.702
- Did you notice
anything about him?

12:17.771 --> 12:20.805
- Not really, but I did notice the
name on his uniform. Unusual name.

12:20.807 --> 12:23.208
Da Gama Window Cleaning.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.577
- Well...

12:25.612 --> 12:27.578
turns out this town's
good for something.

12:27.581 --> 12:30.314
Genuine from the Hudson's Bay.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.750
Isn't that splendid?

12:32.819 --> 12:35.186
We forget a donation

12:35.188 --> 12:38.322
- to the Salvation Army?
- Nora, this is Ms. Cooper.

12:38.325 --> 12:42.227
- She's from our insurance company.
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Amory.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.128
- Oh. Do you have wings, dear?

12:44.131 --> 12:47.132
There's no overnight train
from Pittsburgh.

12:47.167 --> 12:50.334
- So you must've flown.
- You are absolutely right

12:50.337 --> 12:53.638
Mrs. Amory. I am
from the New York office.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.573
- Oh.

12:55.641 --> 12:58.943
Darling, will you have Crosby
fetch me one of those

12:58.945 --> 13:02.013
exquisite ginger ales? I'm parched.

13:02.015 --> 13:05.283
- Coming right up, dear.
- Mmm.

13:05.318 --> 13:08.386
You're no insurance investigator.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.288
- I'm sorry?
- Eastford Insurance

13:10.290 --> 13:12.557
would never let a woman
oversee a $100 000 claim.

13:12.559 --> 13:15.293
Nice try, honey. You can tell
whatever rag you're working for

13:15.361 --> 13:17.061
there's no story here. Now get lost.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.384
- Hello, Frankie.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.253
- Ernest Hemingway.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.188
How can I help you?

13:44.191 --> 13:46.924
- Well, I thought I'd drop by
and see how you liked my piece

13:46.927 --> 13:49.360
- on the Milwinder case.
- It was a vast improvement.

13:49.362 --> 13:52.063
- I'll take that as a compliment.
- It was meant as one.

13:52.131 --> 13:54.232
I'm sorry, it's been a very trying day.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.334
- I'm sorry to hear that.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.936
- So what are you really
doing here? I know you don't

13:58.939 --> 14:00.771
care about my opinion of your article.

14:00.774 --> 14:02.585
Well, why would you say
something like that?

14:02.588 --> 14:03.708
Because you write whatever

14:03.776 --> 14:06.043
you want. You don't give
a damn what people think.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.245
Now that is a compliment.

14:07.247 --> 14:09.147
- So what's up?

14:09.182 --> 14:11.883
- I'm writing a major
investigative piece, and I think

14:11.885 --> 14:14.519
- you might be able to help me.
- Well, I doubt that.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.554
- Ooh, it's a real hum-dinger.
- There's a missing

14:16.623 --> 14:19.223
gold shipment and even stolen pearls.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.725
Also, a private eye with a dubious past.

14:20.727 --> 14:23.628
- Sounds like a best-seller.
- Doesn't it?

14:23.630 --> 14:26.231
- Well, I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.132
- I thought
that might be your answer.

14:28.134 --> 14:30.234
Well...

14:30.237 --> 14:33.704
it's something to think about.
Someone will write this story.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.907
I thought it best if it were a friend.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.078
Good day.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.988
- I don't see any listing
for De Gama Window Cleaning.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.758
- I figured as much.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.394
- Care to clarify?
- When I was a kid, my father

14:56.396 --> 14:58.596
would read me tales of explorers.

14:58.598 --> 15:01.565
When he needed a fake name for
a job, I would get to choose.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.567
Columbus, Magellan,

15:03.636 --> 15:05.937
Cabot... De Gama.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.805
- Another of your
father's signatures.

15:07.807 --> 15:10.574
Kind of points back to the gang.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.877
- I'm also beginning
to wonder about Mrs. Amory.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.513
I mean, she made me on the spot.

15:14.516 --> 15:17.014
Well, her valet told me
that she's a gold digger.

15:17.017 --> 15:20.151
He also told me that her father
is a Methodist pastor in Albany.

15:20.153 --> 15:24.455
- That, I believe.
- I made a few calls.

15:24.457 --> 15:27.158
Turns out there's only one
Methodist church in that city,

15:27.160 --> 15:30.161
same pastor for the last 50 years.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.263
- Let me guess.

15:32.331 --> 15:35.533
He never had a daughter named Nora.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.501
You again! Better without

15:37.504 --> 15:39.370
the drab jacket but not much.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.238
- We need to talk.

15:41.307 --> 15:43.174
- I think not.
- A preacher's daughter?

15:43.176 --> 15:46.444
Well, that's a good story.
Now, is Mr. Amory aware that he

15:46.446 --> 15:48.980
- married an impostor?
- Sh, sh! Keep your voice down.

15:49.015 --> 15:51.950
- Did you steal those pearls?
- Certainly not.

15:51.985 --> 15:52.724
Who's asking?

15:52.727 --> 15:54.953
I'm a private detective.
My name is Frankie Drake.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.125
- Frankie as in Francis
with an I?

16:01.127 --> 16:03.795
- How do you know that?

16:03.863 --> 16:07.365
- Who are you?
- My name's...

16:07.433 --> 16:10.702
was... Nora Drake.

16:15.941 --> 16:17.875
I'm your mother.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.692
I'm as shocked as you
are, but it's true.

16:31.695 --> 16:32.656
Well, then prove it!

16:32.659 --> 16:35.493
- Well, your name is Francis, spelled
the male way. Your father chose that.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.928
- So you knew my father. That
does not make you my mother.

16:37.931 --> 16:39.609
- Ned was on his way
to register your birth

16:39.612 --> 16:41.332
when he saw a map of
Francis Drake's travels

16:41.334 --> 16:44.068
in some bookstore window and he
got that name in his fool head

16:44.136 --> 16:46.170
and forgot the name I wanted
for you, Cleopatra.

16:46.206 --> 16:49.907
At least I managed to get him
to call you Frankie.

16:49.909 --> 16:52.109
- He always told me
that I had him to thank

16:52.178 --> 16:54.678
for not having some...
dreadful name like Cleopatra.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.915
- Well, of course he did,
because Ned never had an ounce

16:57.917 --> 16:59.784
of imagination.
And where is he, by the way,

16:59.786 --> 17:01.986
- because I want my pearls back!
- Ned didn't do this.

17:02.022 --> 17:04.555
- Of course he did.
- He left the feather behind.

17:04.623 --> 17:07.425
- He died 10 years ago.

17:10.496 --> 17:14.131
What gives you the right to come
back here after all these years?

17:14.134 --> 17:16.267
- I certainly wasn't looking
for you, that's for sure.

17:16.269 --> 17:18.969
- Oh, is that supposed to make
me feel better? I think you're

17:18.972 --> 17:20.538
dead and all you have to say
is you weren't looking for me?

17:20.573 --> 17:22.425
Hey, hey. This isn't
easy for me, either.

17:22.429 --> 17:23.441
Where have you been?!

17:23.476 --> 17:25.976
- You know, here and there.
- New York, Chicago, Pittsburgh...

17:25.979 --> 17:29.213
- So why did you come back?
- Abe dragged me here on business!

17:29.215 --> 17:33.050
- No. No, you came back
thinking Ned was alive.

17:33.119 --> 17:35.253
You stole those pearls
and tried to frame him.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.692
- Aw, sweetheart. Look around.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.828
I have everything I want,
and until yesterday,

17:43.896 --> 17:46.297
that included a priceless set
of pearls that my husband

17:46.299 --> 17:48.299
bought for me!

17:53.439 --> 17:56.674
<i> It's a miracle.</i>

17:56.676 --> 17:59.977
My late mother just rose from the dead
and, surprise surprise, she's the devil.

18:00.013 --> 18:01.779
You don't know for
sure that she's a thief.

18:01.782 --> 18:03.013
I know for sure she's a liar.

18:03.016 --> 18:05.649
She ran out on my father, Trudy.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.618
She left me, her own daughter.

18:07.620 --> 18:10.654
- Did you ask her why?
- I was too stunned.

18:10.657 --> 18:12.957
- You must remember
something about her.

18:12.992 --> 18:14.959
- Only what my father told me.

18:15.027 --> 18:17.095
I was too young.
There weren't any photos.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.466
Maybe her smile.

18:22.469 --> 18:25.136
She was always smiling.

18:25.171 --> 18:27.171
No, I probably made that up.
She couldn't have

18:27.239 --> 18:29.173
been very happy if she ran out on us.

18:29.175 --> 18:32.610
Come in.

18:35.247 --> 18:37.281
- I have that research
you asked for.

18:37.350 --> 18:40.951
I have a friend at headquarters
who made a few calls.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.786
- Oh. A gentleman friend?

18:42.789 --> 18:45.789
- Perhaps.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.858
Uh, anyway, uh...

18:47.861 --> 18:50.728
my friend checked in

18:50.796 --> 18:52.697
with the New York, Chicago
and Pittsburgh

18:52.732 --> 18:54.732
police departments
for notable jewel thefts.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.635
- And?
- And there were

18:57.703 --> 19:00.804
three robberies where the names
of explorers were used.

19:00.807 --> 19:04.308
On a Fifth Avenue heist,
the thief even posed

19:04.310 --> 19:06.477
as a courier from Cartier.

19:06.513 --> 19:09.313
- Cartier! What that woman
won't steal.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.382
- At least she was telling the
truth about where she's been.

19:11.384 --> 19:15.052
- Just not what she's been up to.
- I'm sorry, Frankie.

19:15.088 --> 19:17.188
- You know, I spent
my entire life wondering

19:17.256 --> 19:19.157
what it would be like if she was alive.

19:19.192 --> 19:21.325
It just goes to show,

19:21.361 --> 19:24.828
be careful what you wish for.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.331
- I don't know what's going on.

19:27.367 --> 19:30.901
But I... I do sense
that something is going on.

19:30.904 --> 19:33.337
- I'll fill you in
sometime, Mary.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.873
- Now is just not it.
- Oh, all right.

19:35.875 --> 19:38.876
Um, Frankie, there is one more thing.

19:38.878 --> 19:42.413
The police think that you
had help pulling this job.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.281
Someone on the inside.

19:44.284 --> 19:47.351
And they're looking at everyone,
even the Amorys.

19:50.223 --> 19:53.257
- OK. Bring the bag.
- Bring the bags. Come on!

19:55.228 --> 19:57.395
Hey.

20:00.299 --> 20:02.266
Union Station.

20:05.572 --> 20:07.738
- Mind if I tag along?
- Yeah, I do.

20:07.806 --> 20:09.774
- So, where are we headed? Back
to Pittsburgh? New York again?

20:09.842 --> 20:11.809
Or are we going somewhere new?
I hear California's nice.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.778
- Frankie...
- I don't care. I won't

20:13.846 --> 20:15.746
stop you. Just hand over the pearls.

20:15.814 --> 20:17.581
- We need a moment.

20:17.584 --> 20:20.985
Don't go anywhere. Get out.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.623
I already told you, I'm not the thief.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.306
This escape plan would prove otherwise.

20:27.309 --> 20:28.592
The cops are sniffing around.

20:28.595 --> 20:31.395
If they find out I am Nora Drake,
they're gonna try to hang this on me.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.698
- No, on us! They already think
I'm working with an inside man.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.033
With your history of jewellery
thefts behind you, it's only

20:36.102 --> 20:38.402
a matter of time before they
put two and two together.

20:38.404 --> 20:41.171
- Listen, I swear I went straight
when I met Abe. There's no better con

20:41.174 --> 20:43.140
than marrying a rich man. It's
much easier and he does love me.

20:43.142 --> 20:46.677
- Well, as much as that warms my heart,
I don't think the cops will buy that.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.679
- How many times do I have
to say it? I didn't do this!

20:48.681 --> 20:50.581
- Well, then who did?!

20:50.617 --> 20:53.317
- Ugh, fine! Unload the bags.
- Wait, what are you doing?

20:53.386 --> 20:55.185
- I'm helping you
get my pearls back.

20:55.188 --> 20:57.187
- I don't need your help!
- Oh, that's too bad.

20:57.190 --> 20:59.690
- Excuse me?!
- Think about it. If it's only

20:59.692 --> 21:01.759
a matter of time before they
nail one or both of us, then we

21:01.761 --> 21:03.327
need each other and no one knew
your father better than me.

21:03.329 --> 21:05.229
- Fine. We work together.

21:05.231 --> 21:07.098
We find the thief. We get the
pearls and then you leave town.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.506
Fine! And we never have to
see each other again. Deal?

21:09.509 --> 21:10.301
Deal!

21:17.009 --> 21:19.010
<i> Come in!</i>

21:20.847 --> 21:23.314
I haven't changed my mind.

21:23.382 --> 21:26.216
- I'm not here about that.

21:26.219 --> 21:28.552
Well, actually, I am.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.587
Sort of.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.923
But first, I wanted to say I'm sorry.

21:32.925 --> 21:36.727
Clearly this is more sensitive
to you than I realized.

21:36.763 --> 21:40.298
If I offended you... I apologize.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.700
- Apology accepted.

21:46.405 --> 21:48.339
- This is for you.

21:48.374 --> 21:51.275
It's a copy of this photo the cops had.

21:51.343 --> 21:54.378
It's the only photo
of Ned Drake I could find.

21:56.382 --> 21:59.283
I don't know who the woman is
in the photo, but...

21:59.285 --> 22:02.820
I think I recognize the child.

22:02.855 --> 22:04.855
I thought you might like to have it.

22:06.893 --> 22:09.060
- Thank you.

22:12.031 --> 22:15.065
- I'm still writing my story,
should you ever

22:15.068 --> 22:17.601
want to give me an exclusive.

22:34.286 --> 22:36.320
- You're gonna have no eyebrows
left if you keep that up.

22:36.388 --> 22:38.589
- I'm just thinking.

22:38.591 --> 22:41.158
This'll help.

22:43.228 --> 22:46.130
So... how'd it go with your mom?

22:46.198 --> 22:48.932
- She says that she's innocent.

22:48.935 --> 22:50.934
She wants to work together
to figure this out.

22:51.003 --> 22:52.936
- How do you feel about that?
- Well, how am I supposed

22:52.939 --> 22:55.806
to feel? My dead mother
turns out to be alive.

22:55.808 --> 22:57.808
My father lied to me
my entire life. And I've been

22:57.810 --> 23:00.778
running around, pointing fingers
and it's gotten me nowhere.

23:00.780 --> 23:03.781
- So what're you gonna do?

23:03.849 --> 23:05.883
- I don't know.

23:05.951 --> 23:08.552
- Maybe you should...

23:08.620 --> 23:10.454
take her offer.

23:12.891 --> 23:14.858
- For her to help?

23:14.927 --> 23:16.994
There's nothing she can do.

23:19.332 --> 23:22.099
Well, maybe there is something.

23:28.274 --> 23:31.242
- What's up, Frankie?

23:31.310 --> 23:33.177
- Did you find the pearls?
- Not exactly.

23:33.212 --> 23:36.647
- Well, this better be important. I
have a vote at City Hall in an hour.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.715
- Remember when you said
no one else was involved?

23:38.718 --> 23:41.352
Turns out you were wrong.

23:45.124 --> 23:47.124
- Nora.

23:47.126 --> 23:49.326
I never thought I'd see
your traitorous face again.

23:49.328 --> 23:51.195
- Likewise, I'm sure.

23:51.197 --> 23:54.131
- Judging from your reactions,

23:54.133 --> 23:56.834
I'm guessing you both
knew that she was alive.

23:56.836 --> 23:59.636
- Really, Jack?
- Ned swore us to silence.

23:59.639 --> 24:02.139
No matter what happened,
you were never to know.

24:02.175 --> 24:04.875
- Besides, she was dead to us.
- You're charming as ever, Jack.

24:04.944 --> 24:07.544
- After the way you broke up
the gang, and Ned's heart...

24:07.547 --> 24:09.980
- Oh, please!
- Abandoning your own child?

24:09.982 --> 24:13.484
- Get off your high horse, Morris! We
all know how you financed your career.

24:13.519 --> 24:16.220
- Shut up, everyone! I don't
care about ancient history.

24:16.255 --> 24:18.689
The only thing I care about
is finding the thief.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.557
- Yeah. You know perfectly well
you stole the pearls, just

24:20.560 --> 24:23.027
like you knew perfectly well
who you were stealing them from.

24:23.062 --> 24:25.696
Me.

24:25.698 --> 24:28.999
- She's Nora Amory now.

24:29.001 --> 24:33.036
- Now I wish we'd done this job.
- Fine, Nora.

24:33.039 --> 24:35.706
I'll bite. How did we do it?

24:35.708 --> 24:38.408
- Exactly the way
I would've done it.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.978
<i>A flower delivery comes to the door.</i>

24:41.046 --> 24:42.913
<i>Carnations - should've
been my first clue.</i>

24:42.949 --> 24:45.783
Who sends a woman carnations?
Anyway, that'd be you, Morris.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.051
<i>You put 'em by the window</i>

24:48.120 --> 24:50.053
<i>and then you unlock it
when Abe's back is turned.</i>

24:50.056 --> 24:53.423
<i>Then a window washer would've appeared
outside, and that'd be you, Jack.</i>

24:53.426 --> 24:57.361
Da Gama! I always told Ned that
name stuck in peoples' minds!

24:57.363 --> 25:00.864
You know what you should've
gone with? Champlain.

25:00.867 --> 25:04.368
<i>And when Abe leaves, you come in through
the conveniently unlocked window.</i>

25:04.370 --> 25:06.603
<i>No mystery where a safe is
in a suite and a lock like that</i>

25:06.606 --> 25:09.072
<i>would've been a piece of cake
for a safecracker like you.</i>

25:09.075 --> 25:11.742
you replace the pearls

25:11.777 --> 25:14.211
<i>with a drake feather. I wouldn't expect</i>

25:14.247 --> 25:16.413
<i>you baboons to come up
with anything original.</i>

25:16.449 --> 25:19.950
- So then what? If Jack left through the
front door, someone would've seen him.

25:19.952 --> 25:21.919
- No, he went out
through the window.

25:21.921 --> 25:24.021
- But the window was
locked from the inside.

25:24.056 --> 25:25.956
- Mm. Exactly.
- The only way to get away

25:25.992 --> 25:29.826
with a plan like that is
to pay attention to the details.

25:29.895 --> 25:32.329
<i>You see, Morris here went back
after Abe returned</i>

25:32.331 --> 25:34.831
<i>and locked the window.</i>

25:34.834 --> 25:37.834
Just like old times, right boys?
And now, the only thing

25:37.837 --> 25:40.103
that's left is for the best
fence in town to get to work.

25:40.106 --> 25:42.973
- So hand 'em over, Morris.
- I had nothing to do with this.

25:42.975 --> 25:44.817
I like it at City Hall.
Not interested in

25:44.820 --> 25:46.577
spending the rest of my life in prison.

25:46.612 --> 25:49.313
- You won't have a life to spend
unless you give me back

25:49.348 --> 25:51.682
- what's mine!
- Frankie, don't believe her

25:51.684 --> 25:54.017
- for a second.
- Well, this is getting us

25:54.086 --> 25:57.020
- nowhere fast.
- Watch your back, Frankie.

25:57.023 --> 25:59.657
There's no honour amongst thieves.

26:07.032 --> 26:08.999
- You're right.
- I don't think they did it.

26:09.001 --> 26:11.668
- Why the change of heart?
- Oh, come on. Those blockheads?

26:11.671 --> 26:13.804
They could never pull off
a stunt like that without me.

26:13.872 --> 26:16.139
- Without you?
- Why? What are you thinking,

26:16.142 --> 26:18.542
Ned was the brains of the operation?

26:18.610 --> 26:20.777
Hate to burst your bubble,
sweetheart. That honour was

26:20.846 --> 26:22.746
all mine. Even the feather,
that was my idea.

26:22.815 --> 26:24.748
I mean, Ned may have been a good father,

26:24.784 --> 26:27.484
but, you know, he was a small
thinker. He pulled small cons.

26:27.486 --> 26:30.220
50 bucks here, 50 bucks there. But...

26:30.289 --> 26:32.522
- Well, I never saw him con
anybody who didn't deserve it.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.491
- Yeah, well, that's
another way of saying

26:34.559 --> 26:36.627
- he lacked ambition.
- Well, if he had been locked up

26:36.629 --> 26:38.562
for pulling some big job, I
would've been left with nobody.

26:38.631 --> 26:41.465
Why did he tell me you were dead?

26:44.570 --> 26:46.837
- You know when everything
changed? When you were born.

26:46.905 --> 26:49.306
For me, that gold job.

26:49.375 --> 26:52.309
OK, that was just the beginning,
but then Ned didn't wanna

26:52.345 --> 26:55.312
do that kind of thing anymore.
And then he made me choose:

26:55.381 --> 26:57.381
- all or nothing. And I chose...
- Nothing.

26:59.819 --> 27:02.285
- Well, whoever the thief is,

27:02.354 --> 27:04.454
they pulled the job
like the Drake Gang, right?

27:04.457 --> 27:06.356
- Right.
- So I'm thinking they would

27:06.425 --> 27:08.325
fence the pearls like we would've done.

27:08.394 --> 27:11.528
- And that would be?
- We'll need newspapers.

27:23.508 --> 27:26.377
Nice place you've got here.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.516
Hm.

27:35.520 --> 27:38.422
Oh, so this is a hookah.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.490
- Uh-huh.

27:40.493 --> 27:42.960
- Where'd you get it?
- Egypt.

27:43.028 --> 27:46.363
- Egypt? What took you to Egypt?

27:46.365 --> 27:48.432
- Chance, if you must know.

27:48.434 --> 27:50.234
- Yes, I must.

27:50.269 --> 27:53.470
- I met an archaeologist
on the overnight train

27:53.472 --> 27:56.073
to Marseilles. Howard Carter.

27:56.075 --> 27:58.676
He was looking for
the tombs of the pharaohs

27:58.711 --> 28:00.711
and he convinced me to go
to the Valley of the Kings

28:00.713 --> 28:02.513
- with him.
- How'd you like digging

28:02.581 --> 28:04.381
- in the sand?
- It was fascinating.

28:04.383 --> 28:06.850
- Mhm. But you left
Mr. Carter behind.

28:06.886 --> 28:10.087
- It wasn't like that.
- Besides, the war intervened.

28:10.089 --> 28:12.589
- Yeah, didn't it just.

28:12.658 --> 28:15.059
Well, smoking is a filthy habit.

28:15.094 --> 28:17.795
- Who are you, my mother?
- Oh, wait...

28:17.830 --> 28:21.064
- How do you pay for all this?

28:21.067 --> 28:24.434
- I work.
- Well, that's a novel approach.

28:24.437 --> 28:26.403
Oh, and you have a servant.

28:26.439 --> 28:29.005
Excuse me, Miss. Can you
fetch me a drink, please?

28:29.008 --> 28:30.907
The strongest booze
you've got, I'll take.

28:30.910 --> 28:32.810
- Trudy, meet Nora Amory.

28:32.845 --> 28:34.945
- Oh, your dead mother.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.913
This explains

28:36.916 --> 28:39.149
so many things.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.351
- Trudy is not a servant.

28:41.353 --> 28:43.253
- She works with me.
- Isn't that the same thing?

28:43.255 --> 28:46.423
- As a detective.
- Ah. My mistake.

28:46.491 --> 28:48.759
<i>Enchantée,</i> Trudy.

28:48.761 --> 28:51.228
- So what's with all the papers

28:51.296 --> 28:53.630
- Nora has a hunch
how the thief is going to try

28:53.698 --> 28:55.632
- to fence the pearls.
- They're gonna try

28:55.700 --> 28:58.302
to communicate using
a Lost and Found ad.

28:58.337 --> 29:00.437
The thief will post found
and the fence will post

29:00.439 --> 29:03.774
lost and name a place for the thief
to leave proof he's got the goods.

29:03.809 --> 29:05.842
- Pearls are from the ocean,
so we're looking

29:05.845 --> 29:08.345
for something with reference
to the sea or water.

29:12.117 --> 29:14.050
- Hey, how about this.
"Found - Short-hair Pomeranian

29:14.053 --> 29:16.286
"on Cherry Beach. Owner must

29:16.288 --> 29:18.188
describe colour and pay for this ad."

29:18.190 --> 29:22.025
- Definitely not.
- Oh, here. "Found -

29:22.027 --> 29:25.562
"clamshell handbag
at the Crown Ascot Hotel.

29:25.564 --> 29:27.664
Unique item."
- That's it. No imagination

29:27.666 --> 29:30.367
though, they almost
give the whole thing away.

29:30.369 --> 29:32.469
- Wait, here.
This morning's paper. "Lost -

29:32.471 --> 29:34.371
"clamshell handbag.

29:34.406 --> 29:35.739
"Bring to the ducks
across the Poppy and Pauper,

29:35.808 --> 29:38.208
200 Winchester."
- 200 Winchester.

29:38.277 --> 29:41.612
- That's the Necropolis.
- Classic cemetery meet.

29:43.949 --> 29:45.882
Well, now we just have to find the ducks

29:45.951 --> 29:48.452
across from the Poppy and
the Paupers, Ms. Detective.

29:52.991 --> 29:55.425
- War graves... that could
be what "poppy" means.

29:55.493 --> 29:57.561
- Mhm.
- And there's the city graves

29:57.629 --> 30:00.297
for the poor, the "paupers".
This is where the city graves

30:00.299 --> 30:02.232
- meet the war graves.
- So what do you think

30:02.301 --> 30:06.036
they mean by the ducks?

30:06.038 --> 30:08.772
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

30:13.679 --> 30:16.380
You no good,

30:16.415 --> 30:19.049
lying sack of...

30:22.521 --> 30:24.388
- Morris, don't.

30:26.258 --> 30:28.158
- Carved from soap
and covered in boot black.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.193
Ugh! He never could

30:30.196 --> 30:32.229
stomach violence. Thank you.
Now at the risk

30:32.297 --> 30:34.398
of sounding repetitive,
where are my pearls?

30:34.433 --> 30:36.433
- I don't know.

30:38.804 --> 30:40.871
- You know I can break it.
- You've seen me do it.

30:40.906 --> 30:42.906
- All right. I... I don't know

30:42.974 --> 30:45.742
where the pearls are, not yet.

30:47.812 --> 30:50.380
I checked the classifieds

30:50.382 --> 30:52.683
after you told us
how the scam went down.

30:52.751 --> 30:54.551
- I couldn't help myself!
- And Jack?

30:54.587 --> 30:57.087
- Doesn't know a thing
about this. That's the truth.

31:00.426 --> 31:02.092
- All right Morris, where's
the drop? The ducks

31:02.094 --> 31:04.328
across from the poppies
and the pauper? Which grave?

31:06.599 --> 31:08.699
- I know which one.
- You do?

31:11.437 --> 31:13.436
Oh.

31:13.505 --> 31:15.972
- Ow.

31:18.510 --> 31:20.577
- This is funny to you?

31:20.646 --> 31:22.579
- Oh, come on.

31:22.581 --> 31:25.482
Ned would've loved that he
was being used for a drop!

31:29.755 --> 31:32.723
Oh. Yeah, well.

31:32.758 --> 31:35.659
Nice to think he's buried beside me.

31:35.661 --> 31:37.294
Nicer to know I'm not in there.

31:38.864 --> 31:41.031
Oh...

31:41.033 --> 31:44.801
- They're just flowers.
- I come by every once in a while.

31:44.803 --> 31:46.603
You don't need to get
all sentimental about it.

31:48.473 --> 31:50.307
- You never told me how he died.

31:50.309 --> 31:53.210
- Some kids were in a brawl.

31:55.314 --> 31:57.213
One of them...

31:57.282 --> 31:59.349
Dad knew the kid's mother.

31:59.351 --> 32:02.085
- He intervened.
- Oh...

32:02.121 --> 32:04.788
- Took a few blows to the head
and died a few days later.

32:04.856 --> 32:07.057
- Just like Ned, huh?

32:07.125 --> 32:09.092
Always stickin' his nose in

32:09.160 --> 32:11.094
where it didn't belong.

32:11.096 --> 32:13.697
- Let's find whatever proof
the thief left

32:13.699 --> 32:16.366
- and get out of here.
- Yeah. Yeah.

32:23.075 --> 32:25.075
- This looks like the thing.

32:29.248 --> 32:31.247
- Yeah. That's from my necklace.

32:31.250 --> 32:33.683
- I'll hang on to that.

32:33.752 --> 32:37.053
- Oh. Yeah, sure.

32:37.056 --> 32:40.357
Aw, Neddy.

32:40.359 --> 32:42.459
You know...

32:42.527 --> 32:45.062
he may be the only man
I ever really loved.

32:45.130 --> 32:48.431
- You left him.
- Yeah, but I

32:48.434 --> 32:50.267
would've made a mess
of things eventually, so...

32:52.071 --> 32:54.571
You know, I... I see

32:54.639 --> 32:56.906
a lot of your father in you.

32:56.909 --> 32:59.476
I think he'd be, uh...

32:59.544 --> 33:01.478
Well, he'd like...

33:01.546 --> 33:03.480
He'd like how you turned out.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.882
- Well, I'm a work in progress.

33:05.884 --> 33:07.984
- Oh. Yeah.

33:15.794 --> 33:17.694
You wanna know something, Morris?

33:17.696 --> 33:20.430
This would've been a whole lot
simpler if you just told us

33:20.432 --> 33:22.432
the truth in the first place.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.467
Though the truth was never
your strong point, was it?

33:24.536 --> 33:26.302
- I don't have anything
to do with this, Nora.

33:26.305 --> 33:28.538
- You're not weaseling out.
- In fact, you're helping us

33:28.606 --> 33:30.907
get to the bottom of this. Now do it.

33:30.909 --> 33:33.476
- Ahem. Yeah, hello.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.545
Classified desk, please.

33:35.613 --> 33:39.082
Uh, yeah. I have an item
for this evening's edition.

33:39.084 --> 33:44.254
<i>Urgent. Lost - clamshell handbag.</i>

33:44.289 --> 33:46.390
Meet in the Crown Ascot lobby, 3PM.

33:48.793 --> 33:50.727
Yeah.

33:58.604 --> 34:00.470
- Who is he, Frankie?
- That's what we're gonna

34:00.538 --> 34:03.606
find out. Morris' classified ad
has the meeting

34:03.675 --> 34:06.476
set for 3PM in the lobby
of the Crown Ascot hotel.

34:06.544 --> 34:08.878
- Who's the buyer?
- Jack is.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.214
- I'll dust off my good suit.

34:11.216 --> 34:14.051
<i>You and Morris will
be sitting here, waiting for</i>

34:14.085 --> 34:17.054
<i>the seller. Trudy, you're
gonna pose as Jack's nurse.</i>

34:17.089 --> 34:19.889
You'll block the front entrance
once the mark is in position.

34:19.891 --> 34:22.058
<i>Nora and I will be close by,</i>

34:22.061 --> 34:24.527
but we're gonna hang back until
Jack has the pearls in his hand.

34:24.530 --> 34:27.297
<i> Not bad, Frankie.</i>

34:27.331 --> 34:30.567
This whole setup, I mean.
Maybe you do take after me.

34:30.635 --> 34:32.469
- Is that supposed
to be a compliment?

34:32.536 --> 34:34.371
- Yeah. Don't get all
sentimental about it.

34:36.875 --> 34:40.342
You know, it's, um...
it's true things changed

34:40.344 --> 34:42.512
- when you were born.
- You don't have to...

34:42.580 --> 34:44.781
- No, no. It's, um...

34:44.783 --> 34:47.083
It's not that I didn't care.

34:47.119 --> 34:49.385
It's just that I'm not maternal.

34:49.420 --> 34:52.755
And your father, he only
wanted what was best

34:52.757 --> 34:56.059
for you and... and leaving was
the best thing I could've done.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.061
- Well, that's honest.

34:58.063 --> 35:00.296
- I'm happy this happened.

35:00.299 --> 35:03.066
- Yeah? You're happy to have me
over your priceless pearls?

35:03.102 --> 35:04.935
- Well, let's not go that far.

35:06.738 --> 35:09.472
- Oh, no.

35:09.475 --> 35:11.274
- If the thief sees Abe,
he'll get spooked and run.

35:11.276 --> 35:13.309
- I'll handle this.

35:13.312 --> 35:16.946
Sweetheart! Oh, my gosh...

35:16.949 --> 35:19.549
- What is this?
- What are you doing here?

35:19.551 --> 35:21.351
You know what,

35:21.386 --> 35:23.386
I want a drink in...

35:23.454 --> 35:26.089
Come on, I just don't
wanna go in by myself.

35:26.091 --> 35:29.092
- What's going on, Frankie?

35:29.094 --> 35:32.095
- Just having tea
with an old friend.

35:32.097 --> 35:34.030
- Really? You know,
I've been watching you

35:34.098 --> 35:36.599
for some time and it seems
like something else is going on.

35:36.602 --> 35:38.835
- I think you're letting your
imagination get the best of you.

35:38.837 --> 35:41.438
You should stick to fact,
not fiction, Hemingway.

35:41.473 --> 35:44.708
- The woman who was
just sitting next to you...

35:44.743 --> 35:47.110
- An old family friend.
- I couldn't help but notice

35:47.112 --> 35:49.579
she seemed very familiar with Abe Amory.

35:49.581 --> 35:52.015
If I'm not mistaken, that's his wife.

35:52.017 --> 35:54.117
But I think I recognize her
from somewhere else.

35:54.119 --> 35:56.119
A photo, perhaps?

35:56.155 --> 35:58.722
- OK. What do you want?

35:58.757 --> 36:00.590
- The inside scoop.

36:00.626 --> 36:02.792
- And if I say no?
- Then you won't have

36:02.860 --> 36:05.795
any editorial input on
the story. What gets written...

36:05.864 --> 36:08.932
Well, it could say all kinds of things.

36:08.934 --> 36:11.701
- I get to vet the story
before it goes to press?

36:14.505 --> 36:17.007
Sometimes I have very mixed
feelings about you, Hemingway.

36:17.042 --> 36:19.376
Now get out of here.

36:36.161 --> 36:38.161
- What are you doing?
- He isn't coming.

36:38.197 --> 36:41.631
- Did we do something wrong?
- But the ad was crystal clear.

36:41.667 --> 36:44.467
- Maybe he got cold feet.
- Maybe he saw Abe.

36:47.206 --> 36:49.206
Maybe not.

36:56.214 --> 36:59.315
- You again!
- Mr. Amory.

36:59.318 --> 37:01.551
- You can cut the act.
- I know you're not an insurance

37:01.619 --> 37:03.987
investigator. Now get out of
here before I call the police.

37:03.989 --> 37:07.090
- Go ahead. Call the police. You can
let them know I'm a private detective.

37:07.092 --> 37:10.660
- A private detective?
- Who hired you?

37:10.662 --> 37:12.562
- Well, that isn't important.
- What is important is

37:12.630 --> 37:14.431
I just watched you try
to sell your own pearls.

37:16.501 --> 37:18.568
- That's ridiculous. In fact,
I just found the pearls.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.536
They'd simply been misplaced.

37:20.539 --> 37:22.572
It was all just
a terrible misunderstanding.

37:22.574 --> 37:25.675
Now, if you would just kindly
leave my wife and myself

37:25.677 --> 37:28.278
- in peace.
- Mr. Amory, no.

37:28.280 --> 37:31.681
The police would've searched
this room top to bottom.

37:31.683 --> 37:33.683
This is insurance fraud
and now you're trying

37:33.751 --> 37:36.085
- to wiggle your way out of it.
- I beg your pardon!

37:36.088 --> 37:39.356
- It's quite brilliant, in fact,
trying to cash in twice.

37:39.391 --> 37:41.825
My only question is, why would a man

37:41.860 --> 37:44.260
richer than Rockefeller
need that much money?

37:44.263 --> 37:46.296
- I said leave.

37:46.364 --> 37:48.464
- Gambling?

37:48.467 --> 37:50.500
Perhaps blackmail?

38:00.011 --> 38:01.944
- My wife.

38:01.947 --> 38:04.080
- Nora?

38:06.150 --> 38:08.985
- She has very expensive tastes,

38:08.987 --> 38:11.721
and my company's been in trouble
for a while now.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.590
- You're telling me

38:13.658 --> 38:15.458
that Nora has bled you dry?

38:15.460 --> 38:17.727
- She'd leave me if she knew.
- She'd leave you anyway.

38:17.796 --> 38:20.463
That's what she does.

38:20.499 --> 38:23.433
She's a grifter. A thief.

38:23.435 --> 38:25.568
- How the hell would you
know all this?

38:25.570 --> 38:28.271
- Because she's my mother.

38:28.273 --> 38:32.008
Her real name is Nora Drake.

38:32.010 --> 38:34.077
My name is Frankie Drake.

38:34.112 --> 38:36.279
- Drake.

38:38.917 --> 38:41.084
When we first got together, Nora and I,

38:41.152 --> 38:44.754
we'd lie in bed at night
and tell each other stories.

38:46.657 --> 38:49.025
Hers were always about these...
master thieves

38:49.093 --> 38:51.160
she'd heard about in Toronto...

38:51.163 --> 38:53.262
the Drake Gang.

38:53.265 --> 38:56.299
How they pulled off perfect crimes.

38:56.301 --> 38:59.602
- That's how you knew
about the feather.

39:01.506 --> 39:03.673
- I took bits and pieces of her
stories and cobbled together

39:03.741 --> 39:05.975
a plan I thought would be their style.

39:08.046 --> 39:10.346
I never realized she was
telling me about herself.

39:10.349 --> 39:13.216
- Where are the pearls
right now?

39:29.401 --> 39:32.335
- They're gone!
- Where is she?

39:34.506 --> 39:36.673
- In the bath tub.
- Nora?

39:41.046 --> 39:43.012
- What's the matter?

39:43.014 --> 39:45.815
- Is something wrong?
- She's gone.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.153
No! Wait! Wait!

39:50.221 --> 39:53.156
Stop!

39:53.224 --> 39:55.425
- Frankie...

40:03.268 --> 40:08.070
Don't ask why. It's the only
motherly instinct I've ever had

40:08.073 --> 40:10.774
and it's making me uncomfortable.

40:32.397 --> 40:35.298
stop by.

40:35.366 --> 40:37.733
Please, can I get you something?
A cup of tea?

40:37.736 --> 40:39.669
I've got some fine ginger ale.

40:39.671 --> 40:41.971
- No, thank you.
- I just came to say goodbye.

40:41.973 --> 40:44.240
- Oh.

40:44.242 --> 40:46.676
- So where's Abe?

40:46.678 --> 40:49.011
- We, uh...

40:49.080 --> 40:51.247
You know, we had
a mutual parting of the ways.

40:51.249 --> 40:53.950
Which is a shame, really, because he was

40:54.018 --> 40:56.085
- a wonderful companion.
- Until he went broke.

40:56.153 --> 40:57.898
- Hey, that was entirely his fault.
All he

40:57.901 --> 40:59.689
had to do was say no
every once in a while.

40:59.691 --> 41:01.758
- Well, I hope he makes
good use of those pearls.

41:04.129 --> 41:06.262
- You gave him the pearls.

41:06.264 --> 41:09.031
- Of course I did!
- They were his, after all.

41:09.034 --> 41:12.768
- Yeah. Well, no wonder he
took being dumped so well.

41:12.771 --> 41:15.438
- So what are you gonna do now?
- Squander another man's fortune?

41:15.440 --> 41:17.040
- Yeah, and it's
slim pickings in this city.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.578
- Wait. You're staying?

41:21.613 --> 41:24.547
- Well, just...

41:24.549 --> 41:27.383
- you know, for a while.
- We had a deal.

41:27.385 --> 41:30.286
- Listen. You don't have
to believe me, Frankie,

41:30.288 --> 41:32.288
but I'm ready to start a new life.

41:32.290 --> 41:34.257
- Yeah, well, don't think we're
pals just because we got out

41:34.325 --> 41:37.460
- of one scrape together.
- Yeah, I wouldn't dare.

41:42.934 --> 41:44.901
- You still offering
that ginger ale?

41:54.279 --> 41:56.246
- It's a bit on the drab side.

42:02.754 --> 42:04.854
How 'bout that.

42:04.856 --> 42:07.357
- How 'bout that.

42:22.440 --> 42:25.041
- This article is eye-opening.

42:25.043 --> 42:28.511
I mean, I knew a bit about your
family, but... I never imagined!

42:28.579 --> 42:31.514
- Remember, that was
the edited version.

42:31.516 --> 42:34.517
- Mary, just like I told
Hemingway, no one can know

42:34.585 --> 42:37.587
who the Drake Gang is.
Or that Nora is still alive.

42:37.655 --> 42:39.889
And especially not that she's
my mother. Promise me.

42:39.891 --> 42:42.392
- Mum's the word.

42:42.460 --> 42:45.394
- It might not be so bad,
having your mother around.

42:45.397 --> 42:48.931
- Some families are good.
- Mine... not so good.

42:48.934 --> 42:51.534
- You know what's sad?

42:51.603 --> 42:53.869
I never got to see the infamous pearls.

42:53.872 --> 42:56.973
- Hang on. I still have one.

43:10.788 --> 43:12.689
Of course.
