13:14.210 --> 13:17.297
but I can also get you

13:14.210 --> 13:17.297
a booster seat.

13:17.338 --> 13:18.797
Hey, I was just looking for ya.

13:18.839 --> 13:20.592
In Shannon's office?

13:20.634 --> 13:22.385
-Well, you're here, aren't you?

13:20.634 --> 13:22.385
-[Shannon] About that,

13:22.427 --> 13:24.053
Kimchee and I were talking

13:24.095 --> 13:27.390
and we think it'd be best

13:24.095 --> 13:27.390
if we all respect

13:24.095 --> 13:27.390
the new chain of command.

13:27.432 --> 13:30.809
-Absolutely. I just want--

13:27.432 --> 13:30.809
<i>-♪ La, la, la, la, la ♪</i>

13:30.851 --> 13:32.853
Sorry, kidding.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.939
But you should tell it

13:32.895 --> 13:34.939
to Kimchee.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.275
-Sure.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.275
-Pretend

13:34.981 --> 13:37.275
I'm not even here.

13:39.026 --> 13:40.654
What's up, man?

13:40.695 --> 13:42.863
Well, it's probably nothing,

13:40.695 --> 13:42.863
but I couldn't help but notice

13:42.905 --> 13:45.366
a bit of a divide

13:42.905 --> 13:45.366
between management

13:42.905 --> 13:45.366
and the workers.

13:45.408 --> 13:48.244
Really?

13:45.408 --> 13:48.244
Sorry, not listening.

13:48.286 --> 13:51.038
Anyway, they've brought a number

13:48.286 --> 13:51.038
of issues to my attention.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.415
You've been here a day.

13:52.457 --> 13:54.833
Anyway, I made a list

13:52.457 --> 13:54.833
of concerns, suggestions.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.879
"Shorten hallway to lunchroom."

13:58.921 --> 14:00.423
Yeah, I could probably

13:58.921 --> 14:00.423
work with them on that.

14:00.465 --> 14:02.841
The important part

14:00.465 --> 14:02.841
is all of this could be

14:00.465 --> 14:02.841
easily managed

14:02.883 --> 14:05.011
with the right point-person

14:02.883 --> 14:05.011
in the back.

14:05.052 --> 14:08.055
Well, that's not a bad idea.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.725
And I'll be honest.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.725
It's been really hard

14:08.097 --> 14:10.725
since they merge.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.143
We're all taking

14:10.767 --> 14:12.143
more work home,

14:12.185 --> 14:13.478
and you try to stay positive

14:13.520 --> 14:15.854
but cats figure it out.

14:15.896 --> 14:17.565
I just think that we

14:15.896 --> 14:17.565
could all benefit from,

14:17.607 --> 14:20.067
I don't know,

14:17.607 --> 14:20.067
a back manager.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.112
Strong suggestion, bro.

14:23.154 --> 14:24.905
Hey, I'm just trying to help.

14:24.947 --> 14:28.075
And I'll see what we can do

14:24.947 --> 14:28.075
about getting you

14:24.947 --> 14:28.075
some butter pants.

14:28.117 --> 14:31.663
-Oh, um, better pens.

14:28.117 --> 14:31.663
-Oh.

14:31.705 --> 14:35.333
The apartment, right?

14:31.705 --> 14:35.333
It isn't that big of a place.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.210
Uh-huh.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.838
And Janet and I have a tonne

14:37.251 --> 14:39.838
of school work to do.

14:39.879 --> 14:43.550
-And there's the kitchen

14:39.879 --> 14:43.550
and cooking.

14:39.879 --> 14:43.550
-I love cooking.

14:43.591 --> 14:44.884
[sighs] I know.

14:45.968 --> 14:48.471
Um, it just

14:48.513 --> 14:52.726
might be unfair to Janet

14:48.513 --> 14:52.726
to have a third roommate.

14:52.767 --> 14:56.563
It's a lot for her

14:52.767 --> 14:56.563
and other people.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.900
-I get it.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.900
-Oh, great.

15:01.484 --> 15:03.444
Great. Okay.

15:03.486 --> 15:06.947
Oh, hey, I didn't realize

15:03.486 --> 15:06.947
you guys are here.

15:03.486 --> 15:06.947
I'll just come back later.

15:06.989 --> 15:09.909
[Chelsea]

15:06.989 --> 15:09.909
No, stay. Gerald and I

15:06.989 --> 15:09.909
were just talking

15:09.950 --> 15:11.952
and I agree with him.

15:11.994 --> 15:15.707
-You do?

15:11.994 --> 15:15.707
-So, we're gonna find

15:11.994 --> 15:15.707
a place of our own.

15:15.749 --> 15:16.957
-What?

15:15.749 --> 15:16.957
-No.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.460
I don't think that

15:16.999 --> 15:19.460
that's what I was saying.

15:19.502 --> 15:22.296
Oh, are you saying

15:19.502 --> 15:22.296
Janet should move out?

15:19.502 --> 15:22.296
That doesn't seem fair.

15:22.338 --> 15:24.716
I think what Gerald

15:22.338 --> 15:24.716
is trying to say

15:24.758 --> 15:26.967
is you were super generous

15:24.758 --> 15:26.967
with the rent money.

15:27.009 --> 15:30.971
Oh, and I got us HBO.

15:27.009 --> 15:30.971
Just a sec, I've got cupcakes

15:27.009 --> 15:30.971
in the oven.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.974
It's just that we're always

15:31.013 --> 15:33.974
in each other's space

15:31.013 --> 15:33.974
when it's so small.

15:34.016 --> 15:37.978
And it could be bigger

15:34.016 --> 15:37.978
if one of us were to leave.

15:38.020 --> 15:41.775
-Do you want to leave, Gerald?

15:38.020 --> 15:41.775
-Not by myself.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.693
So you do want

15:41.816 --> 15:43.693
to get a place together?

15:43.735 --> 15:44.985
Is this a subscription

15:43.735 --> 15:44.985
to<i> Elle?</i>

15:45.027 --> 15:46.613
I got us<i> The New Yorker</i> too.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.406
Oh, my God,

15:46.654 --> 15:48.406
you went to The Big Carrot.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.409
Look, I just think

15:48.448 --> 15:51.409
there's one scenario that

15:48.448 --> 15:51.409
we haven't considered yet.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.202
I just don't want to leave

15:51.451 --> 15:53.202
Janet in the lurch.

15:53.244 --> 15:54.621
Mmm, no, me neither.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.831
Moving out is so hard

15:56.873 --> 15:59.125
and finding other people

15:56.873 --> 15:59.125
to live with

15:56.873 --> 15:59.125
is a whole other story.

15:59.166 --> 16:02.002
There are a lot of weirdos

15:59.166 --> 16:02.002
out there.

16:02.044 --> 16:06.466
Maybe, we just stay like this

16:02.044 --> 16:06.466
for now.

16:06.507 --> 16:09.009
-[whispering]

16:06.507 --> 16:09.009
What are you doing?

16:06.507 --> 16:09.009
-These are really good.

16:09.051 --> 16:12.179
[gasps] We are

16:09.051 --> 16:12.179
gonna get so fat.

16:14.891 --> 16:17.017
Again, sorry for the delay.

16:17.059 --> 16:21.355
-Getting used to the route.

16:17.059 --> 16:21.355
-Some thing are worth the wait.

16:21.397 --> 16:24.024
-That's very kind.

16:21.397 --> 16:24.024
-She mean box of chip.

16:24.066 --> 16:28.446
Oh, just don't listen to him.

16:24.066 --> 16:28.446
He's just my brother.

16:24.066 --> 16:28.446
My grumpy, older brother.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.866
-Okay, that's enough.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.866
-I'm Carl, by the way.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.868
-Yong-mi.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.868
-Mrs. Kim.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.536
Guess we'll be seeing

16:33.910 --> 16:35.536
a lot of each other.

16:35.578 --> 16:38.665
-Oh. [giggles]

16:35.578 --> 16:38.665
-I meant with the deliveries.

16:38.706 --> 16:42.209
-Okay, thank you. Bye.

16:38.706 --> 16:42.209
-Oh, Carl.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.044
This box is little bit damaged.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.839
Is there anything you can do?

16:47.256 --> 16:49.592
Guess I could take 15% off.

16:49.634 --> 16:52.052
That's okay!

16:49.634 --> 16:52.052
We pay full price.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.054
-You do that for me?

16:52.094 --> 16:54.054
[giggles]

16:52.094 --> 16:54.054
-Sure.

16:54.096 --> 16:56.641
Hmm. Here's your invoice.

16:58.100 --> 17:01.020
That's our number

16:58.100 --> 17:01.020
and, uh, that is my number.

17:02.480 --> 17:03.731
<i>Yobo?</i>

17:03.773 --> 17:06.609
If you ever want to get

17:03.773 --> 17:06.609

17:06.651 --> 17:09.069
-Oh, no.

17:06.651 --> 17:09.069
-Oh, I'm sorry.

17:09.111 --> 17:12.239
I thought I picked up

17:09.111 --> 17:12.239
on some-- I just got

17:09.111 --> 17:12.239
out of a relationship.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.408
It is so hard putting yourself

17:12.281 --> 17:14.408
back out there.

17:14.450 --> 17:17.495
Oh, no, no. You're not wrong.

17:14.450 --> 17:17.495
I give you signal.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.789
Oh, oh, okay.

17:19.831 --> 17:21.624
Well, do you like barbecue

17:21.666 --> 17:23.417
-because

17:21.666 --> 17:23.417
I know this great place--

17:21.666 --> 17:23.417
-No.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.044
Right. I'm going to go now.

17:28.715 --> 17:31.425
-It goes in recycling.

17:28.715 --> 17:31.425
-It's garbage.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.093
It still goes in recycling.

17:33.135 --> 17:35.304
Is there an issue here?

17:35.346 --> 17:38.098
I guess we should take it up

17:35.346 --> 17:38.098
with the "back manager."

17:38.140 --> 17:39.976
-So, what's up?

17:38.140 --> 17:39.976
-Terence.

17:42.144 --> 17:44.564
Is this garbage or recycling?

17:44.605 --> 17:47.107
-Um, recycling.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.107
-Damn.

17:47.149 --> 17:48.526
I guess he is helpful.

-Yeah, great idea, man.

17:54.699 --> 17:58.285
-Seriously, Terence?

17:54.699 --> 17:58.285
-Since you left,

17:54.699 --> 17:58.285
he's got seniority.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.120
And he's very dedicated.

18:00.162 --> 18:02.373
[Terence]

18:00.162 --> 18:02.373
No, Mom, I didn't get fired.

20:11.919 --> 20:14.254
You like pizza.

20:11.919 --> 20:14.254
This is good for you.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.966
Hey, roomies.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.966
I got my name on the lease,

20:17.008 --> 20:19.927
-so everything's official.

20:17.008 --> 20:19.927
-Oh.

20:19.969 --> 20:22.262
-Okay.

20:19.969 --> 20:22.262
-And I can't believe you didn't

20:19.969 --> 20:22.262
have renter's insurance.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.640
-So, I got us that, too.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.640
-Great, thanks.

20:24.682 --> 20:26.809
That's really involved.

20:26.851 --> 20:29.269
No problem.

20:26.851 --> 20:29.269
I'll just add it

20:26.851 --> 20:29.269
to the receipts.

20:29.311 --> 20:32.314
-I'm sorry, those are--

20:29.311 --> 20:32.314
-Organic groceries,

20:32.356 --> 20:34.274
HBO, magazine subscriptions,

20:34.316 --> 20:36.903
air purifier. Oh!

20:36.944 --> 20:40.698
-My Aveda shampoo Janet likes.

20:36.944 --> 20:40.698
-I only used it once.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.324
We'll split it three ways.

20:42.366 --> 20:45.078
You can just e-transfer me

20:42.366 --> 20:45.078
whenever you like.

20:48.330 --> 20:51.250
-I'm getting another cupcake.

20:48.330 --> 20:51.250
-Get 'em all.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.712
What's problem?

20:52.459 --> 20:54.712
I give you review.

20:54.754 --> 20:58.132
You reviewed me as a customer

20:54.754 --> 20:58.132
for your store.

20:58.174 --> 21:00.509
-Yeah.

20:58.174 --> 21:00.509
-Not a very good one

20:58.174 --> 21:00.509
at that.

21:00.551 --> 21:04.097
-Though it is fair.

21:00.551 --> 21:04.097
-Excuse me,

21:00.551 --> 21:04.097
do you have Cherry Sours?

21:04.138 --> 21:07.850
Oh, I guess we just found

21:04.138 --> 21:07.850
your secret admirer.

21:07.892 --> 21:09.268
-Wait, no.

21:07.892 --> 21:09.268
-Madam.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.355
-He's married.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.355
-She just want the candy.

21:13.397 --> 21:14.690
Don't we all.

21:15.942 --> 21:16.943
Hi, there.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.278
I'm Frank.
