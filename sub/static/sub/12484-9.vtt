00:03.680 --> 00:06.650
Wait. What are these?

00:06.680 --> 00:08.550
Well, the sign said chicken nuggets,
but I wouldn't be surprised.

00:08.580 --> 00:12.590
If there were some pigeon in there.

00:12.620 --> 00:15.760
No, no, but what happened to the
ones shaped like dinosaurs?

00:15.790 --> 00:17.860
I cannot eat these!
They're boring!

00:17.890 --> 00:23.860
It'd be like eating applesauce
without chopsticks.

00:23.900 --> 00:24.760
<i>Live, from the cafeteria,</i>

00:24.800 --> 00:28.870
<i>It's the 22nd</i>
<i>webster wolf awards!</i>

00:28.900 --> 00:32.770
<i>And now, your host,</i> <i>the lovely,
beautiful,</i> <i>and talented...</i>

00:32.810 --> 00:35.710
<i>Principal Skidmore!</i>

00:42.650 --> 00:43.680
What's going on?

00:43.720 --> 00:46.890
Skidmore gives out these
awards four times a year.

00:46.920 --> 00:50.380
Why? Because she wants to
recognize student achievement?

00:50.410 --> 00:51.820
No, because she has all
these evening gowns.

00:51.860 --> 00:53.860
And no one will ask her on a date.

01:42.710 --> 01:43.610
Whoo!

01:50.820 --> 01:53.140
And for best cheerleader
in a supporting role,

01:53.210 --> 01:55.160
The wacky goes to...

01:55.580 --> 01:57.210
Paisley houndstooth!

01:57.370 --> 01:59.400
Ha! Yay!

01:59.560 --> 02:01.760
I want to thank all the other cheerleaders.

02:01.800 --> 02:04.960
For reminding me that there's no "I" in "team."

02:05.000 --> 02:07.930
Because I used
with an "I."

02:07.970 --> 02:09.900
And next up, the wacky for.

02:09.940 --> 02:12.640
Best performance of "happy birthday"

02:12.670 --> 02:16.120
Sung to me on my birthday goes to...

02:16.260 --> 02:18.030
Chyna parks!

02:20.650 --> 02:21.650
Thank you!

02:21.680 --> 02:24.720
It's an incredible honor
to receive this award,

02:24.750 --> 02:25.920
Especially given how many years.

02:25.950 --> 02:28.890
"Principal Skidmore
sung to her.Py birthday"

02:28.920 --> 02:30.990
What is it, like 75?
No.

02:31.020 --> 02:31.990
80?
Sit down!

02:36.900 --> 02:39.930
Wow. Everybody
except you.Y.

02:39.970 --> 02:41.030
Even the lunch lady.

02:43.670 --> 02:46.010
The show's not over yet.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.010
And the last award of the day.

02:48.040 --> 02:50.010
Honors someone waiting patiently.

02:50.040 --> 02:52.680
For the recognition they so richly deserve.

02:52.710 --> 02:54.750
Oh, here we go.

02:54.780 --> 02:57.080
And the wacky goes to...

02:59.690 --> 03:02.990
Me! Best award
show host!

03:03.020 --> 03:04.920
Thank you!
Wait, what?

03:15.700 --> 03:17.000
Hey, Cameron.
I got you something.

03:17.040 --> 03:19.940
It's a trophy for best zinger.

03:19.970 --> 03:21.810
Best zinger?
Yeah.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.740
You know how you zing me all the time?

03:23.780 --> 03:25.710
Like the other day I said,

03:25.750 --> 03:28.780
"nice pimple, Cameron.
Looks like your forehead has an on-off button."

03:31.650 --> 03:33.750
And then you said,
"that's what you think."

03:36.820 --> 03:39.860
Zinger!
In my face!

03:42.760 --> 03:44.730
This says "best singer,"

03:44.760 --> 03:46.900
And the "s" is changed
to a "z" with a marker.

03:46.930 --> 03:50.640
Pathetic. Bam!
Another zinger!

03:50.670 --> 03:52.770
You are on fire!

03:56.840 --> 03:58.940
Oh, hey, mom.

03:58.980 --> 04:00.850
Ow!

04:00.880 --> 04:02.750
Ow!

04:04.750 --> 04:06.850
Sorry, I forgot I was still in my costume.

04:06.890 --> 04:08.890
How was the party?
Terrible.

04:08.920 --> 04:10.890
In space, no one can hear you scream,

04:10.920 --> 04:13.760
But at a four-year-old's birthday
party, that's all you can hear.

04:15.800 --> 04:18.730
Plus, I got frosting on my space pants.

04:18.769 --> 04:20.930
Do you know how much it costs
to dry clean this thing?

04:20.970 --> 04:24.670
Um, 35 bucks?
35 bucks!

04:25.710 --> 04:31.610
Hey, what are all these trophies for?

04:31.640 --> 04:34.680
Nothing. We had an assembly at
school and they gave out awards.

04:34.710 --> 04:36.820
It was stupid.

04:36.850 --> 04:38.880
And you won all of these?

04:38.920 --> 04:39.950
Aw, that's my girl!

04:42.660 --> 04:44.660
Cameron, baby, did you win anything?

04:44.690 --> 04:47.960
No. Everybody got
a trophy but me.

04:47.990 --> 04:51.030
Even that kid who's done
10th grade five times.

04:51.060 --> 04:52.970
Best moustache.

04:54.670 --> 04:55.770
Stupid Melissa.

04:58.040 --> 05:00.810
Cameron would have won something, but.

05:00.840 --> 05:03.810
They didn't have any categories
that played to his strengths.

05:03.840 --> 05:04.840
Right, Cameron?
Right.

05:05.910 --> 05:07.780
Wait, what strengths?

05:12.890 --> 05:14.750
Principal Skidmore, can I talk to you?

05:14.790 --> 05:18.620
Not now. I have an important
schooloard meeting to prepare for.

05:18.660 --> 05:21.890
I'm thinking of entering on a horse.

05:21.930 --> 05:24.280
Sorry, but this is urgent.

05:25.670 --> 05:28.630
A terrible injustice has taken place.

05:28.670 --> 05:30.970
Someone has replaced the dinosaur
nuggets in the cafeteria.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.970
With... With these!

05:34.010 --> 05:36.680
Oh, that was me.

05:36.710 --> 05:38.910
These cost five cents less per ton.

05:38.950 --> 05:42.880
Over the school year,
we can save five cents.

05:42.920 --> 05:45.880
But dinosaur nuggets are
a paleontology lesson.

05:45.920 --> 05:48.720
Wrapped up in a bite-sized
morsel of breaded goodness!

05:48.760 --> 05:50.820
What are these?

05:50.860 --> 05:52.790
Food.

05:54.630 --> 05:56.960
More or less.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.530
Look, you're the only one who cares,

06:00.570 --> 06:02.700
And it's not my job to
make one student happy.

06:02.740 --> 06:07.870
My job is to make all students unhappy.

06:07.910 --> 06:10.580
But I'm not the only one who cares.

06:10.610 --> 06:13.650
In fact, I'll get every kid
in school to sign a petition!

06:13.680 --> 06:15.780
Long live the dinosaur nuggets!

06:17.950 --> 06:20.690
See? Everyone
agrees with me.

06:20.720 --> 06:23.860
No, I just bought a new applause sign.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.930
Okay, Cameron.

06:33.970 --> 06:36.570
Everyone has a special talent
and we're going to find yours.

06:36.600 --> 06:37.870
By going through this list alphabetically.

06:37.900 --> 06:41.710
First up, aardvark whispering.

06:43.880 --> 06:45.740
You think my talent is training aardvarks?

06:45.780 --> 06:47.710
Well, let's find out.

06:53.850 --> 06:56.860
That's not an aardvark.
That's an anteater!

06:56.890 --> 06:58.790
And do you know what anteaters eat?

06:58.830 --> 07:00.530
Ants!

07:00.560 --> 07:01.790
It's right in the name!

07:03.730 --> 07:05.860
Cameron, give it a shot.

07:07.570 --> 07:09.940
Okay, boy.
Roll over.

07:13.710 --> 07:14.610
Play dead.

07:16.910 --> 07:18.810
I stink at this.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.850
What's next on the list?

07:34.760 --> 07:37.700
Okay, so it's not
greco-roman wrestling.

07:40.670 --> 07:44.870
Next up, gymnastics.
Can you do a cartwheel?

07:46.770 --> 07:47.610
Sure.

07:53.710 --> 07:54.850
Cameron, are you okay?

07:58.550 --> 08:01.450
Kind of.

08:01.490 --> 08:02.750
Too bad we already eliminated ballet,

08:02.790 --> 08:04.860
Because he does look good in a tutu.

08:12.670 --> 08:14.830
I guess we can rule out origami.

08:17.700 --> 08:19.770
I'm not good at anything.

08:19.810 --> 08:22.510
I don't know why you
bothered to try, chyna.

08:22.540 --> 08:24.910
I knew this wasn't going to
work before we even started.

08:26.750 --> 08:28.680
Hey!

08:30.680 --> 08:32.820
Maybe that's your special gift.

08:32.850 --> 08:34.820
What is?

08:34.850 --> 08:36.860
You said you knew this
wasn't going to work.

08:36.890 --> 08:38.690
Maybe you're psychic!

08:40.530 --> 08:43.860
Huh. Maybe I am.

08:43.900 --> 08:46.600
Let's check it out.
What number am I thinking of?

08:48.840 --> 08:49.870
Triangle?
Right!

08:50.900 --> 08:53.810
Unbelievable!

08:53.840 --> 08:54.770
"triangle" isn't even a number.

08:54.810 --> 08:59.510
That's what makes it so unbelievable!

08:59.550 --> 09:02.510
Sorry, but there is no such
thing as psychic ability.

09:02.550 --> 09:04.720
I saw an article in the <i>american
psychology</i> <i>journal,</i> issue 121...

09:07.650 --> 09:11.690
I bet you knew olive was going to say
something really boring, didn't you?

09:11.720 --> 09:13.760
I did, now that you mention it.

09:14.630 --> 09:16.530
Wow.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.530
Now, close your eyes.

09:19.570 --> 09:20.670
And see if you can predict the next ant.

09:20.700 --> 09:22.770
That's gonna walk into the room.

09:22.870 --> 09:26.670
Um... You.

09:26.710 --> 09:29.640
Keeping in mind that I'm already here.

09:30.780 --> 09:32.610
And so is olive.

09:32.650 --> 09:35.580
And the only other ant you know the name of.

09:35.620 --> 09:36.820
Is Fletcher.

09:38.720 --> 09:41.750
Is it...
Olive?

09:41.790 --> 09:43.820
Just go with it.

09:44.820 --> 09:46.730
Yes!

09:48.200 --> 09:50.400
Unbelievable!

09:58.620 --> 10:01.330
Well, Cameron's happy.

10:01.360 --> 10:04.390
He thinks he's psychic, but he's happy.

10:06.060 --> 10:08.270
It's kind of ironic that
someone with no future.

10:08.270 --> 10:10.370
Thinks he can predict the future.

10:13.240 --> 10:15.910
Hey, paisley.
Did you hear the incredible news?

10:15.980 --> 10:17.440
I'm psychic!

10:17.480 --> 10:20.240
Oh, I've known that for years.

10:20.280 --> 10:22.460
But I think it's
pronounced "psycho."

10:24.420 --> 10:28.220
No, I can tell what's going
to happen before it does.

10:28.250 --> 10:31.870
In fact, I'm getting a vision right now.

10:31.970 --> 10:33.260
I see...

10:33.290 --> 10:35.290
Angus.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.360
I see him too!

10:38.300 --> 10:41.370
Maybe I'm psycho!

10:42.500 --> 10:45.440
No, I see him in the future.

10:45.470 --> 10:48.370
He's hurt. Sometime
in the next two hours,

10:48.410 --> 10:51.200
He's going to be in a terrible accident!

10:57.580 --> 11:00.890
Now what? Cameron's gonna
realize he's not psychic.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.740
We cannot let that happen.

11:02.800 --> 11:05.290
He'll be even more depressed
than he was before.

11:06.420 --> 11:08.530
There's only one thing to do.

11:08.900 --> 11:10.600
- Tell Cameron the truth?
- No.

11:12.430 --> 11:15.230
Make sure Angus has an accident.

11:15.270 --> 11:18.370
How? Put his hand
in warm water?

11:20.200 --> 11:21.570
Not that kind of accident.

11:31.250 --> 11:34.180
Okay, here comes Angus.

11:34.220 --> 11:37.490
Hey, olive. I just
sent you a text.

11:40.360 --> 11:42.280
No, I will not marry you.

11:44.440 --> 11:45.080
Whoa!

11:46.360 --> 11:49.330
I almost slipped on these banana peels.

11:49.370 --> 11:51.470
What banana
peels? Go on.

11:51.500 --> 11:55.410
Did you put those there?

11:55.440 --> 11:58.340
No, of course not.

11:58.380 --> 12:01.510
Then there must be wild
apes loose in the school.

12:01.550 --> 12:03.210
Run for your lives!

12:06.350 --> 12:11.220
Wow! You really can
predict the future.

12:12.390 --> 12:14.390
Can somebody help me?

12:15.390 --> 12:17.490
I'm getting another vision...

12:19.200 --> 12:20.560
No one's going to help you.

12:22.330 --> 12:24.200
You are so cool!

12:24.240 --> 12:25.300
Everyone! You have
to check this out!

12:25.340 --> 12:28.210
Cameron is a cyclops!

12:30.270 --> 12:30.510
Predict something else!

12:30.540 --> 12:33.540
Okay.

12:33.580 --> 12:37.380
Tomorrow morning
at exactly 9:45,

12:37.420 --> 12:38.550
All the power in the school will go out.

12:38.580 --> 12:40.280
What?

12:42.590 --> 12:46.520
It's 9:45.

12:46.560 --> 12:49.230
Why hasn't the power gone out?

12:49.260 --> 12:52.560
I'll try turning them to high.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.600
This isn't high?

13:16.490 --> 13:19.490
Hey, Fletcher. How's your
dinosaur nugget petition going?

13:19.520 --> 13:21.530
I've only gotten two signatures.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.560
Me and some kid named

13:23.590 --> 13:26.500
"buzz off loser."

13:30.540 --> 13:33.270
Angus! Were you
hurt that badly?

13:35.270 --> 13:37.210
I'm fine.
Just lazy.

13:41.580 --> 13:43.550
So, Angus, will you sign my petition?

13:43.580 --> 13:45.320
I already did.

13:45.350 --> 13:47.450
I'm buzz off loser.

13:50.350 --> 13:52.520
How about you, olive?
No way.

13:52.560 --> 13:55.390
I'm not some upstart, radical
hippie, you agitator!

13:55.430 --> 13:58.600
I love it when she talks crazy.

14:01.530 --> 14:05.140
Well, I don't need you guys.
There's a school board meeting tonight.

14:05.170 --> 14:07.240
I'm going to take my message to the masses.

14:08.270 --> 14:09.270
You got another signature.

14:13.340 --> 14:15.310
"Megan
amessinmypants."

14:18.250 --> 14:20.580
I didn't know miss amessinmypants'
first name was Megan.

14:30.230 --> 14:32.400
Wow, thanks to us, Cameron
is actually popular.

14:32.430 --> 14:36.370
No psychic in the world could
have seen that coming.

14:37.570 --> 14:39.440
I have a vision.

14:39.470 --> 14:41.540
By the end of the day,

14:41.570 --> 14:43.310
Paisley and her boyfriend
Keith are going to break up!

14:48.410 --> 14:50.310
Great.
Now what?

14:51.320 --> 14:53.350
No problem.

14:53.380 --> 14:55.490
We just have to find someone to flirt
with Keith in front of paisley.

14:55.520 --> 14:58.260
And make her so jealous that she dumps him.

14:58.290 --> 15:02.430
We need someone beautiful,
vivacious, irresistible.

15:02.460 --> 15:05.230
I get it.
I'm your girl.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.330
You're going to flirt with Keith?

15:08.370 --> 15:10.400
Well, not dressed like this.

15:14.510 --> 15:16.440
Why are you dressed as a superhero?

15:16.470 --> 15:21.140
Men are attracted to powerful
women, so it was either this.

15:21.180 --> 15:24.510
Or dress up like supreme court
justice sonia sotomayor.

15:26.180 --> 15:28.320
Okay. Look.

15:28.350 --> 15:30.320
There's paisley's boyfriend.

15:30.350 --> 15:31.520
Just stick to the script.

15:37.260 --> 15:40.300
Hey there, big boy.

15:40.330 --> 15:43.200
Why don't I take you somewhere
you've never been before?

15:43.230 --> 15:46.470
Like the school library, I'm guessing?

15:50.370 --> 15:52.310
Hey! Stay away
from my woman!

16:00.350 --> 16:02.420
Keith!

16:02.450 --> 16:06.460
I can't believe you hit this poor
ant's wheelchair with your body!

16:06.490 --> 16:09.160
You are so mean.

16:09.190 --> 16:10.460
We're through.

16:13.300 --> 16:18.200
Wow. Sometimes the power of my
raw magnetism frightens me.

16:20.570 --> 16:23.470
Wow, another impressive prediction.

16:23.510 --> 16:27.210
That's 17 today.

16:27.250 --> 16:28.550
You must be pretty happy.

16:32.180 --> 16:35.450
Are those tears of Joy, I hope?

16:35.490 --> 16:39.190
What's the matter?
You have an amazing gift.

16:39.220 --> 16:40.520
And paisley's available now.

16:40.560 --> 16:45.360
Well, it turns out my
power isn't just a gift.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.300
It's also a curse.

16:46.330 --> 16:48.160
I just had an awful vision.

16:48.200 --> 16:51.330
Skidmore in a bikini?

16:51.370 --> 16:53.240
Much worse.

16:53.270 --> 16:54.240
Tomorrow morning, an asteroid
will strike the earth,

16:54.270 --> 16:57.240
Ending all life as we know it.

16:58.110 --> 17:01.250
That's bad, but it's not worse
than Skidmore in a bikini.

17:10.950 --> 17:12.980
Of all the things to predict,

17:13.010 --> 17:15.119
Cameron had to go with
the end of the world?

17:15.150 --> 17:19.150
He's even untalented at having fake talent.

17:19.910 --> 17:23.210
Do we really have to end the world
just to keep your brother happy?

17:24.890 --> 17:28.010
Can't we just tell him the truth
and get him an ice cream?

17:30.100 --> 17:32.930
Don't worry.
We're not going to do anything.

17:32.970 --> 17:34.330
Tomorrow, he'll realize he's not psychic.

17:34.370 --> 17:36.170
And this whole thing will be over.

17:37.140 --> 17:40.070
Unless...

17:40.110 --> 17:41.940
No, olive, he's not actually psychic,

17:41.980 --> 17:47.080
And an asteroid is not gonna
destroy the planet tomorrow.

17:47.110 --> 17:48.950
Okay. But if
it does,

17:48.980 --> 17:50.080
That'd be a huge burn on us.

17:57.990 --> 18:00.960
Why is everyone focusing
on the money I spent.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.200
For the horse I rode in on?

18:03.160 --> 18:07.100
Let's focus on all the money I saved.

18:07.130 --> 18:11.270
By replacing the school nurse
with this first aid Kit.

18:13.980 --> 18:15.040
I can't believe we came
here to support Fletcher.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.180
And he didn't even show up.

18:21.080 --> 18:23.280
Oh, this was totally worth the wait.

18:24.350 --> 18:26.290
65 million years ago,

18:26.320 --> 18:28.920
Dinosaurs became extinct.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.020
Five days ago,

18:30.060 --> 18:33.090
Dinosaur nuggets became extinct,

18:33.130 --> 18:37.000
Eliminating the last evidence of
the great reptiles' existence.

18:39.270 --> 18:40.330
What about museums?

18:41.070 --> 18:43.300
Okay, the last meaningful evidence.

18:44.310 --> 18:49.010
Does anybody have anything
intelligent to say?

18:49.040 --> 18:49.980
I do!

18:50.010 --> 18:52.980
My name is Cameron parks,

18:53.010 --> 18:54.050
And I can predict the future!

18:55.380 --> 18:58.050
Oh, no.

18:58.090 --> 18:59.890
Citizens of the world!

18:59.920 --> 19:02.090
Tomorrow morning, at half past noon,

19:02.120 --> 19:03.160
An asteroid will strike the earth.

19:03.190 --> 19:06.260
And the world will end
in a flaming ball of fire!

19:06.290 --> 19:09.260
Ka-blammo!

19:09.300 --> 19:11.130
I am your only hope to save the planet!

19:11.170 --> 19:14.130
I volunteer to be launched into space.

19:14.170 --> 19:15.940
To redirect the asteroid.

19:15.970 --> 19:17.140
From its path of destruction.

19:17.170 --> 19:17.940
Cameron,

19:20.210 --> 19:22.080
I have to tell you something.

19:22.110 --> 19:25.910
Not now!
I'm saving the human race!

19:25.950 --> 19:28.150
I'll be your space cadet!
Blast me off!

19:28.180 --> 19:31.120
I'm wearing a diaper and I'm ready to go!

19:33.190 --> 19:34.990
This is my sister.

19:35.020 --> 19:37.260
She probably just wants to hug me
and wish me luck on my mission.

19:38.230 --> 19:39.060
Yeah, not exactly.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.230
Uh, never mind.

19:48.270 --> 19:51.070
I'd like to turn the floor
back over to the dinosaur.

20:02.180 --> 20:04.280
Chyna!

20:04.320 --> 20:07.950
You gotta check out this video.
It's the greatest thing ever!

20:07.990 --> 20:10.960
If it's the security footage of
the day you forgot to wear pants,

20:10.990 --> 20:14.130
I've seen it, and once
was more than enough.

20:14.160 --> 20:18.400
It's not that. It's your brother
from last night, acting all crazy.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Cameron's coming!

20:23.040 --> 20:25.340
Do not play this on your a.
N.T. Pad. Okay.

20:28.240 --> 20:30.280
Hey, chyna.
I've been thinking,

20:30.310 --> 20:34.080
And I wanted to thank you for
trying to make me feel better.

20:34.120 --> 20:35.320
You're a good sister.

20:35.350 --> 20:37.350
Well, I'm sorry it was
kind of embarrassing.

20:37.390 --> 20:41.150
It was no big deal.
It was a school board meeting.

20:41.190 --> 20:42.290
Only a handful of people saw it.

20:42.320 --> 20:44.090
<i>♪ citizens of the world</i>

20:44.130 --> 20:44.620

Uh...

21:14.190 --> 21:16.120
Only eight million.

21:17.290 --> 21:19.130
Awesome!

21:19.160 --> 21:21.960
I found my talent!
Being famous!

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Play it again!

21:30.200 --> 21:35.180
And the wacky for the best
animal costume goes to...

21:35.210 --> 21:37.110
Artie the anteater!

21:51.130 --> 21:52.390
And our last award.

21:52.430 --> 21:56.130
Is for the most popular
Web video by a student.

21:56.160 --> 21:59.000
And the wacky goes to...
Here we go.

21:59.030 --> 22:02.840
Angus Chestnut for <i>angus
has</i> <i>no pants.</i>

22:02.840 --> 22:03.920
What?

22:11.730 --> 22:13.440
I prepared this speech.

22:13.440 --> 22:16.510
Now... we're together... that...

22:20.090 --> 22:21.570
Oh... Again?
