Yes, sir. I'll have it for you
tomorrow morning.

'Cousin, cousin, don't, don't',

‐ Just wait..

Now, get away, get away,
get away, get back get back.

No, Balki, I'm fine.

‐ I'm fine. Get back.
‐ Can you just get‐‐

01:41.301 --> 01:43.870
‐ No, no, no, Balki.
‐ Don't go so fast.

01:43.904 --> 01:45.438
‐ No, no, no, Balki.
‐ Cousin, don't..

‐ Oh, oh.

a lucky thing I was here.

Now, very slowly,
let me just take‐‐

02:00.821 --> 02:01.888
‐ No, Balki‐‐
‐ Listen.

02:01.922 --> 02:02.823
Just let me the top one.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.495
Good thing, they don't let
you guys handle explosives.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.336
Well, so what is all this?

02:16.369 --> 02:17.938
Don't tell me you're still
writing that article?

02:17.971 --> 02:19.506
Oh, no, Balki,
I'm not writing it.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.241
I'm just doing the research.

02:21.274 --> 02:22.576
Three feature reporters
are writing it.

02:22.609 --> 02:24.845
Oh, well, that hardly
seems fair.

02:25.712 --> 02:27.213
Oh, no, no.

02:27.247 --> 02:29.182
It's great.
I'm learning a lot.

02:29.215 --> 02:32.185
See, the series
is on senior citizens.

02:32.218 --> 02:35.221
And this afternoon I interviewed
a pair of elderly brothers‐‐

Cousin, why you didn't tell me

02:44.430 --> 02:45.799
you were meeting
the elderly brothers?

02:50.804 --> 02:51.938
‐ It was last minute.
‐ Hmm.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.208
You tell me all about it

02:55.241 --> 02:56.643
on the way
to the movie tonight.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.244
‐ Movie?
‐ Yeah.

"Benji The Hunted"

Oh, oh, oh.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.686
Ah, Balki, I‐I can't go
to a movie tonight.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.353
I've gotta stay home.

03:07.387 --> 03:08.855
I've gotta go
through all these files

03:08.889 --> 03:10.223
and take notes on each one.

03:10.256 --> 03:11.324
Oh, cousin, I'm sorry.

03:11.357 --> 03:12.659
I forgot how busy you've been.

03:12.693 --> 03:13.794
Oh, that's okay, Balki.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.261
You enjoy the movie.

03:15.295 --> 03:16.663
Enjoy the movie?

03:16.697 --> 03:17.964
Are you out of my mind?

03:20.033 --> 03:22.268
If you stay home, I stay home.

03:22.302 --> 03:23.637
Now, this is what
we're gonna do.

03:23.670 --> 03:26.540
I'll read you the files,
and you take notes.

No, uh, Balki, I really
should read them myself.

You're absolutely right.

03:37.951 --> 03:40.286

Listen, this what
we're gonna do.

Balki.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.912
Ahem. Balki, I‐I better

04:05.946 --> 04:07.881
take the notes myself.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.050
See, I've kinda
got my own system.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.952
But to tell you the truth,
I‐I'd feel terrible

04:11.985 --> 04:14.287
if you missed
"Benji" because of me.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.889
Cousin, please, don't give
it a second thought.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.791

"Benji The Hunted".

05:01.835 --> 05:02.836
Mind blower!

05:05.071 --> 05:06.840
I mean, the whole movie

05:06.873 --> 05:09.442
is shown from a dog's
point of view.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.111
And you know, I never
thought about it before

05:11.144 --> 05:12.646
but that Benji
must get a stiff neck

05:12.679 --> 05:13.947

all the time.

happened after the movie.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.735
Did you know, they let you
make your own hot cocoa?

05:34.768 --> 05:36.402
Well they do.

05:36.436 --> 05:38.438
And it's not as easy
as most people think.

05:38.471 --> 05:39.506
There's a trick to it.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.575
You got to, you got to
keep stirring and stirring

05:41.608 --> 05:42.609
as you add the hot water.

05:42.643 --> 05:45.011
It‐it entails a lot
of hand, eye coordination.

make hot chocolate

help me right now

save your story for later.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.744
Great story.
I laughed. I cried.

06:50.777 --> 06:51.845
Now, can I get
back to my work?

06:53.113 --> 06:55.916
No, so I'm at the night mart

06:55.949 --> 06:58.118
and I see this guy trying
to make hot cocoa.

06:58.151 --> 06:59.753
And he doesn't know
what he's doing.

06:59.786 --> 07:01.187
He's messing it all up.

07:01.221 --> 07:02.989
And he's ending up
with this brown glop.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.691
At the bottom of his cup.

07:04.725 --> 07:07.093
Disgusting.
So I went up to him.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.730
And I decided I'll show
him how to make it the Balki way

07:09.763 --> 07:12.165
which as you know entails
a degree of stirring.

07:12.198 --> 07:14.100
Well, that's nice.
That's nice.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.670

you make a friend.

‐ That's the way it works.
‐ Yeah, but‐but‐‐

07:18.705 --> 07:19.840
‐ Uh‐uh!
‐ Oh.

07:22.709 --> 07:25.145
So well, it was a good thing
I was his friend

07:25.178 --> 07:27.648
because I have to pay
for his hot cocoa.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.716
Oh, you paid for his hot cocoa.

07:29.750 --> 07:30.984
Yeah, yeah, because‐because

07:31.017 --> 07:32.686
when he got up
to the checkout counter

07:32.719 --> 07:34.955
he realized he had
forgot his wallet at home.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.090
Oh, getting
to the checkout line

07:37.123 --> 07:38.258
realizing you don't
have any money.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.660
That can be embarrassing.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.027
But you can say that again

07:41.061 --> 07:42.596
and it‐it was a good thing
I was there

07:42.629 --> 07:44.631
because I also had to pay
for his Dang Dongs.

07:44.665 --> 07:48.068
You paid for his hot chocolate
and his Dang Dongs?

07:48.101 --> 07:50.904
Yeah, yeah, I‐I paid
for his Dang Dongs

07:50.937 --> 07:53.173
and his, uh,
double‐stuffed Oreos

07:53.206 --> 07:55.876
and his Scooter‐pies
and his Twinkies

07:55.909 --> 07:58.512
and his two gallons
of Cookies 'n Cream ice cream.

08:04.785 --> 08:07.721
‐ Uh...Balki, I‐‐
‐ Cousin, cousin, cousin.

08:07.754 --> 08:10.190
I know what you're thinking,
and I asked myself

08:10.223 --> 08:12.292
the very same question.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.928
Isn't this just a little
too much sugar in one's diet?

08:19.700 --> 08:20.867
That's not what I was thinking.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.068
Well, you'll be happy to know

08:22.102 --> 08:24.070
he didn't touch
a single Dang Dong

08:24.104 --> 08:25.672
until after his dinner.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.040
Dinner?

08:27.073 --> 08:29.776
He took me to a very
expensive restaurant.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.145
Wait a minute.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.679
Back up. Back up.

08:33.714 --> 08:34.948
Whoa!

08:39.119 --> 08:42.022
He took you to a very
expensive restaurant?

08:42.054 --> 08:43.256
If he didn't
have any money

08:43.289 --> 08:44.725
how did he pay
for this dinner?

08:44.758 --> 08:45.859
Well, I loaned
him the money

08:45.892 --> 08:47.561
and believe me

08:47.594 --> 08:50.230
he pulled out all the stops.

08:50.263 --> 08:53.266
He insisted we have the best
dinner my money could buy.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.335
Cousin.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.871
This is the part
you're not gonna believe.

08:57.904 --> 08:59.640
I don't know, it's pretty
unbelievable so far.

09:02.709 --> 09:06.179
My new friend
is a world famous athlete.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.982
You're right.
This is a part I don't believe.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.985
At the 1984 Olympics,
he won four gold medals.

09:12.018 --> 09:14.287
Two for running,
one for jumping

09:14.320 --> 09:16.089
and one for handing
someone a stick.

09:20.293 --> 09:21.695
Let me guess, Carl Lewis?

09:21.728 --> 09:22.863
Get out of the city!

09:22.896 --> 09:23.897
‐ You know him too?
‐ No.

09:26.933 --> 09:30.303
No, I don't know him,
and neither do you.

09:30.336 --> 09:32.806
This Carl is a con artist.

09:32.839 --> 09:34.074
No, cousin he is not an artist.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.341
He‐he, have you
been listening?

09:38.144 --> 09:40.881
He's a runner and a jumper
and a stick‐hander‐offer.

09:42.248 --> 09:45.185
Balki, Balki, your friend

09:45.218 --> 09:47.988
Carl Lewis isn't
the real Carl Lewis

09:48.021 --> 09:50.123
and he certainly
isn't your friend.

09:50.156 --> 09:51.758
He's a fake, a fraud, a phony

09:51.792 --> 09:53.894
and probably hypoglycemic.

09:59.866 --> 10:02.302
Cousin, I‐I'm surprised that

10:02.335 --> 10:04.070
you‐you‐you're saying
these things

10:04.104 --> 10:06.306
about someone
you have not even met.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.208
Balki, just think about it.

10:08.241 --> 10:10.644
You met him in an all‐night
grocery store.

10:10.677 --> 10:12.946
He borrowed money
to buy his hot chocolate.

10:12.979 --> 10:15.181
He borrowed money
to buy his groceries.

10:15.215 --> 10:18.919
He borrowed to pay
for an expensive dinner.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.954
Surprised he didn't borrow money
to pay for a cab.

10:20.987 --> 10:23.990
‐ Only $20.
‐ Twenty dollars?

10:24.024 --> 10:25.759
Well, I.. It‐its all
that I had left.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.160
‐ I hope he got home, okay.
‐ Balki.

10:28.962 --> 10:33.033
The real Carl Lewis doesn't
hang out in night marts.

10:33.066 --> 10:36.069
And he doesn't need
to borrow money from you.

10:36.102 --> 10:39.773
Oh, cousin, is that
what's bothering you?

10:39.806 --> 10:42.342
I was wondering what you had
a bee in your pants about.

10:44.144 --> 10:47.147
Cousin, he's going to pay me
back tomorrow at the track meet.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.783
'What track meet?'

10:49.816 --> 10:51.818
He‐he told me
that he's in town

10:51.852 --> 10:53.053
for the track meet tomorrow.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.721
And he's leaving

10:54.755 --> 10:56.256
two tickets
at the box office.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.224
Alright, Balki, listen to me.

10:59.425 --> 11:01.094
There won't be any tickets.

11:01.127 --> 11:03.196
It's all part of the same lie.

11:03.229 --> 11:04.931
This guy already has your money.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.399
You're never gonna
see him again.

11:06.432 --> 11:08.201
Cousin.

11:08.234 --> 11:10.270
Do you know
what your problem is?

11:10.303 --> 11:12.072
You don't trust people.

11:13.039 --> 11:15.441
I trust some people.

11:15.475 --> 11:18.344
I just don't trust strangers
who claim to be somebody famous

11:18.378 --> 11:20.380
and take all my money.

11:20.413 --> 11:23.416
Well, uh, listen you come with
me tomorrow to the box office

11:23.449 --> 11:26.119
and when you see those
tickets and you will

11:26.152 --> 11:28.722
your face is going to be
green with embarrassment.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.859
That's red with embarrassment.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.895
And there won't be any tickets.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.897
‐ There will be tickets.
‐ Aah.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.865
And you're going to come
crawling to me

11:38.899 --> 11:40.867
on your hands and face
and say, Balki..

11:43.036 --> 11:45.371
..why, why can't
I be more like you

11:45.405 --> 11:47.073
and less like me?

11:47.107 --> 11:49.442
Now, if you'll excuse me
I'm going to go upstairs

11:49.475 --> 11:51.912
and get Mary Anne and take
her out for a cup of coffee

11:51.945 --> 11:54.314
because I'm sure she'll be
excited about my new friend.

11:57.518 --> 12:00.086
Cousin, could I borrow some
money until Carl pays me back?

12:00.120 --> 12:01.755
Thank you.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.390
[instrumental music]

12:10.330 --> 12:11.397
[instrumental music]

12:22.242 --> 12:24.477
Uh, please, two tickets under
the name of Carl Lewis.

12:25.879 --> 12:28.214
Ready to eat pigeon, cousin?

12:28.248 --> 12:30.016
Balki, if there
are any tickets here

12:30.050 --> 12:32.218
I'll eat pigeon,
crow, any bird you want.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.319
I got nothing for Carl Lewis.

12:34.588 --> 12:37.457
Oh, um, try under
the name of Bartokomous.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.860
That's B‐A‐R‐T‐O

12:39.893 --> 12:41.061
with a komous at the end.

12:42.563 --> 12:43.797
That's the thing.

12:43.830 --> 12:44.965
Listen, we'll be out
of here before

12:44.998 --> 12:46.466
you can say Smokey Robinson.

12:46.499 --> 12:47.400
I got nothing.

12:48.902 --> 12:51.137
Uh, well, they
have to be there.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.106
Uh, did you try
under Bartokomous?

12:53.139 --> 12:54.174
‐ B‐A‐R‐T‐O‐‐
‐ Yeah, yeah.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.209
I know, with a komous
at the end.

12:56.242 --> 12:58.478
But Lewis didn't leave
anybody any tickets.

12:58.512 --> 13:00.180
Well, eh..

13:00.213 --> 13:01.214
But he's a friend of mine.

13:01.247 --> 13:02.983
I'm happy for you.

13:03.016 --> 13:05.552
But your friend
didn't leave any tickets.

13:05.586 --> 13:07.320
Well, I‐I‐I want to see‐‐

13:08.989 --> 13:10.023
Next.

13:10.056 --> 13:11.424
Balki.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.327
Hey, I'm sorry.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.996
I know you're disappointed.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.931
He probably just forgot
to leave the tickets.

13:17.964 --> 13:19.332
You know, he is very forgetful.

13:19.365 --> 13:22.903
What probably happened
is he decided to take a nap

13:22.936 --> 13:24.605
and he forgot
to set the alarm.

13:24.638 --> 13:25.839
And then when he woke up.

13:25.872 --> 13:27.173
He was so weirded out

13:27.207 --> 13:28.542
that he forget
to bring the tickets.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.578
Balki..

13:31.612 --> 13:32.879
..you have to understand

13:32.913 --> 13:34.380
there are people out there

13:34.414 --> 13:35.616
just waiting to take advantage

13:35.649 --> 13:37.383
of people like you.

13:37.417 --> 13:40.386
Well, uh, cousin,
maybe there are

13:40.420 --> 13:42.856
but my friend Carl
is not one of them.

13:42.889 --> 13:45.158
Your friend Carl,
isn't even Carl.

13:45.191 --> 13:47.027
Cousin, do you know
what you are?

13:47.060 --> 13:49.129
You are a doubting Thomopoulos.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.633
I am not a doubting Thomopoulos.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.434
I'm a realist.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.369
A realist who is freezing
his buns off.

13:57.303 --> 13:58.605
Now, can we go home?

13:58.639 --> 14:00.907
No, cousin..

14:00.941 --> 14:03.043
...we‐we came
here to wait for Carl.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.578
And if you're not
willing to wait for Carl

14:04.611 --> 14:07.013
I don't know why you come
in the first place.

14:07.047 --> 14:10.116
Balki, I came
to look out for you.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.251
I knew there wouldn't
be any tickets.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.452
And I knew you'd be hurt.

14:12.485 --> 14:13.987
Well, I'm not hurt.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.622
So‐so you've wasted
your trip.

14:15.656 --> 14:17.057
Okay, fine.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.158
You stand out here in the cold.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.126
I am going home.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.394
‐ Alright, go home.
‐ I will.

14:22.629 --> 14:23.897
Go home.

14:25.231 --> 14:26.132
You think I won't?

14:27.601 --> 14:29.235
No, I think you will.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.236
I'm not a doubting Thomopoulos.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.305
Okay, here I go.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.324
So you're just
gonna stay here?

14:53.059 --> 14:54.127
Look at me.
Am I moving?

14:55.562 --> 14:56.963
Okay, okay. Fine.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.066
I guess there are
some things

15:00.100 --> 15:01.568
you've just got to
learn for yourself.

15:02.368 --> 15:03.469
I guess so.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.072
Goodnight, cousin.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.479
[instrumental music]

15:32.265 --> 15:34.735
How long has
the track meet been over?

15:34.768 --> 15:36.202
Well, are you're sure
there's no one there?

15:37.704 --> 15:38.705
Well, yes, I know you're there.

15:39.773 --> 15:42.275
Is there anyone else there?

15:42.308 --> 15:45.078
The‐I‐I left him standing right
outside the will call window.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.479
Could you just run outside
and check for me?

15:49.382 --> 15:50.450
Oh, well, that's real nice.

15:51.585 --> 15:53.720
That's real clever.

15:53.754 --> 15:54.955
Well, let me tell you
something, Buster.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.624
I'm rubber and you're glue.

15:57.658 --> 15:59.192
Everything you say
bounces off me

15:59.225 --> 16:00.193
and sticks to you!

16:04.531 --> 16:05.999
Ha!

16:07.033 --> 16:08.101
I'll find him myself.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.476
That's called,
the Fosbury Flop.

16:18.712 --> 16:20.581
Balki, it's 1:00 a. m.

16:20.614 --> 16:21.748
Where have you been?

16:21.782 --> 16:24.017
Funny, funny story, cousin.

16:25.552 --> 16:28.522
Not two minutes after
your compact little legs

16:28.555 --> 16:29.590
carried you away..

16:31.692 --> 16:34.294
...Carl came running
out of the stadium

16:34.327 --> 16:36.196
apologized for not
leaving the tickets

16:36.229 --> 16:39.666
and swept me
into the stadium!

16:39.700 --> 16:42.068
And, and, and there were
no seats left

16:42.102 --> 16:43.670
so he had to give
me a press pass.

16:43.704 --> 16:45.539
‐ A press pass?
‐ And it gets better.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.207
I'm sure it does.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.810
Cousin, it was so much fun
inside that stadium.

16:49.843 --> 16:53.346
Everybody is running
and jumping and throwing things.

16:53.379 --> 16:54.247
Hey, Balki..

16:56.082 --> 16:58.519
...are you trying to tell me
that Carl really showed up?

16:59.285 --> 17:00.320
Cousin..

17:02.155 --> 17:05.025
...half of communication
is being a good listener.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.265
I'm sorry to rub it in.

17:12.298 --> 17:14.300
I‐I know, how embarrassed
you must be

17:14.334 --> 17:15.702
by being completely wrong.

17:15.736 --> 17:19.305
But I was just so happy
when Carl showed up!

17:19.339 --> 17:21.074
Oh, Balki.

17:22.509 --> 17:25.345
Balki, Balki, Balki.

17:28.749 --> 17:30.083
Listen to me.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.356
I know, what you're
going through.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.861
In junior high,
I told Bobby Caruso

17:40.894 --> 17:44.397
that Henry Aaron
was a friend of my dad's

17:44.430 --> 17:47.100
and that he was coming over
for dinner that weekend.

17:47.133 --> 17:49.670
Well, the next day,
every kid in eighth grade

17:49.703 --> 17:50.837
begged me for his autograph.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.673
Bobby Caruso's?

17:55.475 --> 17:57.844
Henry Aaron's.

17:57.878 --> 18:00.714
So what could I do?
I had to save face.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.416
I spent the whole weekend
signing pieces of paper

18:03.449 --> 18:06.820
that said "Best wishes,
stay in school, Henry Aaron."

18:08.889 --> 18:12.659
I stooped to forgery
to avoid humiliation.

18:12.693 --> 18:13.894
Do you see what
I'm getting at?

18:13.927 --> 18:16.663
Well, of course I do.
Don't be ridiculous.

18:19.365 --> 18:21.835
But shouldn't you be telling all
of this to Bobby Caruso?

18:25.706 --> 18:27.508
Balki.

18:27.541 --> 18:30.310
The point is when
you've been hurt

18:30.343 --> 18:33.847
you don't have to make up
a story to save face.

18:38.384 --> 18:39.352
You..

18:40.486 --> 18:41.688
You don't believe me.

18:43.423 --> 18:46.392
Balki, this is Cousin Larry
you're talking to.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.796
Cousin, ever since
I've known you

18:49.830 --> 18:52.198
I have never lied to you.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.734
And even before I knew you

18:53.767 --> 18:55.368
I never lied to you.

18:56.970 --> 18:58.905
And even before
I never lied to you

18:58.939 --> 19:01.207
I never lied to anyone

19:01.241 --> 19:03.443
not even the littlest
sheep in my flock.

19:09.683 --> 19:10.884
So you're gonna stick
to your story.

19:12.418 --> 19:14.154
It's...the truth.

19:14.855 --> 19:16.923
Okay, fine.

19:16.957 --> 19:18.692
Carl Lewis is your friend.
I'm happy for you.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.862
‐ He is.
‐ Hey, I believe it.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.633
So what you and Carl
do after the meet?

19:26.667 --> 19:28.735
Hit the night mart and throw
down a couple of hot chocolates?

19:34.975 --> 19:36.577
Now, you're making fun of Balki.

19:36.610 --> 19:39.312
Look, let's forget the whole
thing. I gotta turn in.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.482
I've got a big day tomorrow.

19:42.516 --> 19:43.817
I'm playing handball
with The Pope.

19:45.519 --> 19:47.253
[knock on door]

19:47.287 --> 19:49.690
Oh, that must be
Morgan Fairchild.

19:49.723 --> 19:51.191
I met her at the Laundromat,
you know.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.304
I'm looking
for Balki Bartokomous.

20:05.706 --> 20:07.674
‐ Carl, come in.
‐ Oh, hey, Balki. How you doin'?

20:09.375 --> 20:10.744
Oh, you left these autographs
in the Limousine.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.345
Oh, thank you.

20:12.378 --> 20:13.914
‐ You're Carl Lewis.
‐ Yeah.

20:15.816 --> 20:17.518
Harriette is gonna love these.

20:17.551 --> 20:19.920
She's a big, big fan of yours
and your brother Jerry.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.024
You must be Larry.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.892
Balki's talks
about you all the time.

20:25.926 --> 20:27.994
You're Carl Lewis.

20:28.028 --> 20:29.429
I was the last time
I looked at myself.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.264
You're Carl Lewis.

20:32.365 --> 20:33.534
Whoa.

20:35.368 --> 20:36.970
Nex‐next time I'm in town,
I'm gonna give you a call.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.939
Okay. Bye, Carl.

20:38.972 --> 20:41.407
And listen if you ever need
a place to crash, feel free.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.276
I'll do that
and nice talking to you, Larry.

20:43.309 --> 20:44.545
[muttering]

20:56.657 --> 20:57.858
That was Carl Lewis.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.596
Yes. Yes, it was.

21:28.689 --> 21:31.357
Yes, yeah‐yea‐ye..

21:31.391 --> 21:34.360
You know‐you know,
I didn't believe you.

21:39.099 --> 21:40.366
No, you didn't.

21:46.072 --> 21:47.908
Carl must think
I'm a real jerk.

21:49.375 --> 21:50.944
I think that's
a distinct possibility.

21:58.619 --> 21:59.953
I made fun of you.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.089
‐ Oh, cousin, I forgive you.
‐ Oh.

22:04.457 --> 22:05.592
You were just trying
to protect me.

22:05.626 --> 22:07.894
Uh, yeah, I‐I was, I was.

22:07.928 --> 22:10.564
And‐and‐and I promise..

22:10.597 --> 22:14.067
...from now on I‐I will never
doubt you ever again.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.703
‐ Really?
‐ Never. Ever never.

22:16.737 --> 22:17.704
Never?

22:17.738 --> 22:19.573
Uh, if you say it..

22:19.606 --> 22:20.507
...I'll believe it.

22:25.145 --> 22:27.681
Well, what if I say that..

22:27.714 --> 22:29.082
...I had dinner with the mayor?

22:29.115 --> 22:30.617
I'd ask what he ordered?

22:33.119 --> 22:34.988
What if I say that NASA

22:35.021 --> 22:36.590
wants me to be an astronaut?

22:36.623 --> 22:37.991
I'd mix up a pitcher of tang.

22:50.470 --> 22:51.905
What if I said..

22:54.174 --> 22:58.712
...that I bought
a handful of magic beans

22:58.745 --> 23:01.582
and I threw them
out the window.

23:01.615 --> 23:03.383
And they grew up..

23:05.118 --> 23:07.988
...into a beanstalk
and it reached to the clouds

23:08.021 --> 23:11.124
and I climbed up it
and I met a giant

23:11.157 --> 23:14.060
who wrestled me
and I came down

23:14.094 --> 23:15.562
