you two went there

04:59.770 --> 05:02.311
-What?
-But you did
not get pregnant

05:02.395 --> 05:05.269
because when they harvested
your eggs, Mrs. Clark,

05:05.353 --> 05:07.895
you were told
they were nonviable.

05:07.978 --> 05:09.395

No. She comes here
in the middle of the night,

just make us a baby

05:48.812 --> 05:52.061
I'm not going to make
you a baby.

05:53.311 --> 05:55.478
I already did.

06:09.269 --> 06:10.770

06:15.269 --> 06:17.353
In anticipation
of our negotiation,

06:17.436 --> 06:20.478

of creating your son.

06:27.061 --> 06:29.186

your relocation cost,

06:33.603 --> 06:37.186
baby food,
college education, etc.

06:37.812 --> 06:40.436

06:56.895 --> 06:59.728

or I'll have
no other choice

06:59.812 --> 07:01.978

a loving home for him.

Will's genetic profile
directly matches

12:43.144 --> 12:46.395
two individuals
in our ancestral database.

12:46.478 --> 12:48.228
Based on
an archival photograph,

12:48.311 --> 12:50.311
the Center can render them now.

12:50.395 --> 12:54.228
Angela, would you like to meet
your great grandparents?

12:54.311 --> 12:56.144
Yeah. Okay.

12:56.436 --> 12:58.061
(chimes)

12:59.687 --> 13:03.937
Obie Williams was born
in Louisiana in 1891.

13:04.019 --> 13:07.019
He enlisted in the US Army
and fought against the Germans

13:07.103 --> 13:08.937
in France in World War I.

13:09.019 --> 13:11.561
He returned to Tulsa
a hero, and reunited

13:11.645 --> 13:15.395
with his childhood
sweetheart, Ruth Robeson.

13:15.478 --> 13:18.520
Obie and Ruth had one son,
but his name was lost

13:18.603 --> 13:21.103
in the fires that consumed
Greenwood's records.

13:21.186 --> 13:22.728
He does, however,

13:22.812 --> 13:26.186
appear in one archival photo
with his parents.

13:28.353 --> 13:30.895
Tragically,
the entire family was killed

13:30.978 --> 13:33.645
in the massacre of 1921.

13:33.728 --> 13:36.395
May they rest in peace.

13:49.144 --> 13:50.895
You're not dead.

13:52.436 --> 13:54.395
You disappeared.

13:57.561 --> 14:00.478
A hundred years from now,
you're gonna roll back
into Tulsa

14:00.561 --> 14:02.728
and blow my life up.

14:04.395 --> 14:06.561
And then disappear again.

14:09.687 --> 14:12.937
You said you wanted me
to know where I came from.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.478
Now I know.

14:18.395 --> 14:20.561
So, wherever you are...

14:23.269 --> 14:25.937
leave me the fuck alone.

14:28.103 --> 14:29.853
(glass shattering in distance)

14:29.937 --> 14:32.311
(car alarm blaring)

14:36.478 --> 14:39.603
(woman laughing)

14:41.770 --> 14:43.269
(laughing continues)

14:43.978 --> 14:45.603
(footsteps approach)

14:45.687 --> 14:48.269
(car alarm blaring)

14:56.478 --> 14:59.144
(car alarm continuing)

15:06.228 --> 15:07.853
(alarm beeps, stops)

15:08.937 --> 15:10.353
This is your car?

15:10.436 --> 15:12.395
-Night: Yeah.
-(car door creaks)

15:12.478 --> 15:14.061
(glass shatters)

15:14.144 --> 15:16.978
-(radio beep, crackles)
-Dispatch, this is Night.

15:17.061 --> 15:20.103
Stolen vehicle recovered
on Greenwood Avenue,

15:20.186 --> 15:23.103
100 block. I need a tow.

15:23.186 --> 15:25.603
Dispatch (on radio):
Copy that. We'll send a rig.

15:26.812 --> 15:28.311
They take anything?

15:29.645 --> 15:31.311
Doesn't look like it.

15:33.478 --> 15:35.144
It fell out of the sky.

15:36.228 --> 15:38.520
-What?
-Your car.

15:39.019 --> 15:41.061
It fell out of the sky.

15:42.520 --> 15:43.645
You're kidding?

15:43.728 --> 15:47.019
I don't kid about things
falling out of the sky.

15:48.228 --> 15:49.520
Angela.

15:53.311 --> 15:56.311
Well, it looks like you got
things under control here, so...

15:56.395 --> 15:58.436
I'll just leave you to it.

15:58.520 --> 15:59.853
(taps car)

16:01.353 --> 16:02.978
Cool costume.

16:04.687 --> 16:06.311
Thanks.

16:16.436 --> 16:19.687
-(glove compartment clicks)
-(bottle rattles)

17:08.687 --> 17:10.103
Topher:
Hi.

17:11.436 --> 17:12.478
Hi.

17:12.561 --> 17:14.937
Rosie and Emma
in your bed?

17:15.019 --> 17:16.937
Angela:
Mm-hmm.

17:17.019 --> 17:19.353
Can I crash here?

17:19.436 --> 17:20.770
Okay.

17:22.019 --> 17:23.645
Where were you?

17:25.853 --> 17:29.228
I had to stay
at the cemetery a while.

17:30.395 --> 17:33.645
The police needed to ask me
a lot of questions.

17:35.770 --> 17:37.937
Are your sisters okay?

17:38.561 --> 17:40.144
I think so.

17:43.728 --> 17:47.103
I didn't see that man
get shot in the head.

17:52.478 --> 17:53.687
But you did.

17:56.478 --> 17:58.687
When the bomb
started beeping,

18:00.144 --> 18:02.311
and then you
saved everybody...

18:07.019 --> 18:08.812
were you scared?

18:10.144 --> 18:12.311
Yeah, I was scared.

18:13.144 --> 18:14.978
(sighs)

18:15.978 --> 18:18.144
Still am, a little.

18:46.728 --> 18:48.728
(song playing on radio)

18:48.812 --> 18:51.019
It fell out of the sky?

18:51.103 --> 18:52.937
(kids murmuring)

18:53.019 --> 18:54.269
That's what she said.

18:54.353 --> 18:58.395
-Cal: The FBI agent?
-Angela: Yes, the FBI agent.

18:58.478 --> 19:00.520
What was she doing there
in the middle of the night?

19:00.603 --> 19:02.728
I didn't ask her.

19:03.520 --> 19:05.853
What were you doing there
in the middle of the night?

19:07.269 --> 19:09.520
Breaking into
the cultural center.

19:10.812 --> 19:12.061
Why?

19:12.144 --> 19:16.103
Because I'm not acting
rationally right now, Calvin.

19:16.186 --> 19:18.311
-Rosie: Yes, he is!
-Topher: He isn't.

19:18.395 --> 19:19.770
Rosie, Emma:
He is, too!

19:19.853 --> 19:21.937
-He is not.
-Rosie: Yes, he is!

19:22.019 --> 19:24.061
Whoa, whoa. What's,
What's going on?

19:24.144 --> 19:25.687
Topher said that Uncle Judd

19:25.770 --> 19:28.353
didn't go to Heaven
when he blowed up!

19:28.770 --> 19:31.395
Sweetheart, um...

19:35.436 --> 19:37.228
Heaven is...

19:37.311 --> 19:38.895
pretend.

19:39.728 --> 19:41.853
So, where is he then?

19:42.561 --> 19:43.728
Well...

19:45.103 --> 19:48.687
Before Uncle Judd was born,
he was nowhere.

19:48.770 --> 19:50.478
Didn't exist.

19:50.561 --> 19:52.019
Then he was a baby,

19:52.103 --> 19:54.228
then he was a child,
then he was an adult.

19:55.019 --> 19:56.978
Then he died.

19:58.645 --> 20:00.937
Now he's nowhere, again.

20:02.436 --> 20:04.103
(timer dings)

20:09.353 --> 20:10.978
Nowhere?

20:11.478 --> 20:13.269
What?
It's the truth.

20:14.103 --> 20:16.520
Okay, who wants waffles?

20:16.603 --> 20:17.937
-Me!
-Me!

20:32.895 --> 20:34.687
(knocking)

20:35.395 --> 20:36.520
Man:
Yeah?

20:37.019 --> 20:38.645
It's Angela.

20:41.019 --> 20:42.436
(clicks)

20:42.520 --> 20:44.353
(squeaking)

20:46.269 --> 20:47.645
Howdy.

20:49.144 --> 20:50.770
(door rattling)

20:51.478 --> 20:52.728
Sorry about
the mess.

20:52.812 --> 20:55.728
Been a couple weeks since
the last squid-fall.

20:56.478 --> 21:00.103
When the sirens stopped,
I knew it wasn't
the big one, so...

21:00.895 --> 21:03.436
I grabbed my camera,
hustled on up there

21:03.520 --> 21:05.687
before any could dissolve.

21:06.395 --> 21:07.478
(sighs)

21:08.186 --> 21:11.103
Poor bastards rain down
on us from another dimension,

21:11.186 --> 21:13.937
probably just as
confused as we are.

21:14.687 --> 21:19.019
Thirty seconds of life,
and they spend all of it dying.

21:19.770 --> 21:21.895
You're fucking weird.

21:23.019 --> 21:24.812
And you are
adequately self-aware

21:24.895 --> 21:27.645
to recognize the hypocrisy
of that remark.

21:32.895 --> 21:34.228
So...

21:35.186 --> 21:37.353
what can I do you for?

21:39.311 --> 21:42.061
-(pills rattle)
-What are these?

21:42.144 --> 21:43.687
Don't know.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.728
I was hoping
you could ask your ex.

21:48.103 --> 21:49.728
We have a lab
down at the precinct.

21:49.812 --> 21:52.311
Your ex has a lab
that's not at the precinct.

21:52.395 --> 21:54.603
And she is indeed my ex.

21:54.687 --> 21:56.561
You told me it was amicable.

21:59.228 --> 22:00.728
Where'd they come from?

22:01.770 --> 22:03.353
Does it matter?

22:04.228 --> 22:05.311
Only if it relates

22:05.395 --> 22:07.770
to the murder of our
beloved chief of police.

22:07.853 --> 22:09.603
You know he was a racist?

22:09.687 --> 22:12.728
He was a white man in Oklahoma.

22:20.561 --> 22:23.061
He hid it in his closet.

22:27.061 --> 22:28.853
You reckon he was Kavalry?

22:28.937 --> 22:31.061
You reckon he was?

22:31.770 --> 22:35.103
Looks like we have
ourselves a reckoning.

22:37.395 --> 22:39.144
This is old school.

22:39.228 --> 22:41.186
Crawford's granddaddy
was a lawman.

22:41.269 --> 22:42.853
Maybe it's just a keepsake.

22:42.937 --> 22:45.561
Can you hold
onto it for me?

22:46.603 --> 22:49.436
So, the FBI lady
won't find it?

22:49.520 --> 22:52.228
So the FBI lady
won't find it.

22:53.395 --> 22:56.812
I suppose you don't want me
to tell her about these, either?

22:57.978 --> 22:59.895
Be careful of that one.

22:59.978 --> 23:02.645
She is extremely weird.

23:47.144 --> 23:48.353
The fuck?

23:49.103 --> 23:51.019
Hey! Police!

23:54.895 --> 23:56.436
Night:
Hey!

24:00.687 --> 24:02.353
Night:
Stop!

24:23.978 --> 24:25.061
Stop!

24:36.311 --> 24:38.019
The fuck?!

24:38.103 --> 24:40.561
(elevator whirring)

24:41.812 --> 24:42.728
(dings)

24:42.812 --> 24:44.812
Can't fool a fly with shit.

24:44.895 --> 24:46.561
(chuckles)

24:47.728 --> 24:49.645
-Hello there.
-Night: Hey.

24:49.728 --> 24:51.395
Gentlemen.

24:55.311 --> 24:57.061
You saved my life.

24:57.478 --> 24:59.103
Angela, right?

25:00.478 --> 25:01.812
Oh.

25:01.895 --> 25:04.186
Am I not supposed
to know who you are?

25:05.895 --> 25:07.520
I'm sorry.

25:08.061 --> 25:10.937
-Night: For what?
-The funeral yesterday.

25:11.228 --> 25:13.978
I should've known
I have a target on my back.

25:14.061 --> 25:16.978
If I wasn't there,
it wouldn't have happened.

25:17.061 --> 25:18.853
You're right.

25:18.937 --> 25:21.186
Try not to get
kidnapped next time.

25:21.645 --> 25:23.728
(laughing)

25:24.603 --> 25:26.228
I'll do that.

25:26.853 --> 25:28.603
You have a nice day,
Detective.

25:28.687 --> 25:31.019
You, too, Senator.

25:31.103 --> 25:33.311
(police radio chatters)

25:33.395 --> 25:36.812
Night:
Do you know any vigilantes
that wear a belt like this?

25:36.895 --> 25:39.478
Tall, skinny,
head-to-toe spandex?

25:39.561 --> 25:41.853
-What'd he do?
-He ran.

25:41.937 --> 25:44.812
Ew! What the fuck
is this?

25:44.895 --> 25:46.645
Some kind of oil.
Guy squirted it

25:46.728 --> 25:49.269
all over himself,
and slid into a sewer grate.

25:49.937 --> 25:53.186
He have any, uh, lettuce
or watch batteries on him?

25:53.269 --> 25:55.812
Was he wearing
a Rorschach and saying,

25:55.895 --> 25:58.353
"Tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock?"

25:58.436 --> 26:00.853
-Night: No.
-Scare: Oh.

26:00.937 --> 26:02.269
Okay.

26:02.353 --> 26:06.728
Then, new boss probably isn't
going to give shit about...

26:06.812 --> 26:08.395
lube man.

26:08.478 --> 26:10.103
New boss?

26:12.019 --> 26:14.812
-(knocking)
-Come in.

26:18.603 --> 26:20.311
You moved into
Crawford's office?

26:20.395 --> 26:22.728
Uh-huh. Is that problematic?

26:22.812 --> 26:25.520
Only if you want everybody
out there to hate you.

26:27.228 --> 26:29.603
Have a lead on
your stolen car.

26:30.645 --> 26:32.978
-Oh?
-Yeah. Uh, we dusted it.

26:33.061 --> 26:35.978
Lots of prints.
Yours, your kids,

26:36.061 --> 26:37.812
but there was another
set of prints.

26:37.895 --> 26:39.395
Mystery prints.

26:39.478 --> 26:41.770
I mean, it could be anybody
who'd been in your car.

26:41.853 --> 26:43.812
You know, friend
or whatever.

26:43.895 --> 26:46.978
But you don't strike me as
the kind of person who...

26:48.019 --> 26:50.269
has friends?

26:50.895 --> 26:52.937
Anyway, they didn't
match any known perps,

26:53.019 --> 26:57.019
so I sent 'em to Quantico, ran
'em through our database and...

26:58.269 --> 27:00.395
they got a hit.

27:01.687 --> 27:03.812
Someone named...

27:06.019 --> 27:08.353
William...

27:08.436 --> 27:11.061
Reeves.

27:12.687 --> 27:14.978
-Ring a bell?
-No.

27:15.061 --> 27:18.144
Apparently, he was
a cop in New York City

27:18.228 --> 27:20.019
in the '40s and '50s.

27:20.103 --> 27:22.228
Retired young.

27:22.853 --> 27:24.520
Fell off the grid.

27:26.186 --> 27:27.603
-A cop?
-By my math,

27:27.687 --> 27:31.019
he has to be... over
a hundred years old by now.

27:32.728 --> 27:35.561
And do you know how 100-year-
olds tend to get around, Angela?

27:36.603 --> 27:38.895
Wheelchairs.

27:41.061 --> 27:43.395
-(door opens)
-Don't you knock?

27:44.812 --> 27:46.186
Oh...

27:46.728 --> 27:49.103
-I just...
-What is it, Petey?

27:54.520 --> 27:56.103
(whispers)

27:56.728 --> 27:58.812
No shit? Ooh.

27:58.895 --> 28:00.144
Perfect timing.

28:00.228 --> 28:02.812
Another lead on your car.

28:02.895 --> 28:05.770
("You're My Thrill"
by Billie Holiday playing)

28:12.103 --> 28:13.853
Mind if I ask you

28:13.937 --> 28:17.228
why the FBI even gives
a shit about my car?

28:17.311 --> 28:19.561
Well, it got stolen right
after Crawford was murdered

28:19.645 --> 28:22.144
and returned the night
of his funeral.

28:22.228 --> 28:25.019
Now, that could
be a coincidence,

28:25.103 --> 28:27.978
but, however, I think...

28:28.937 --> 28:32.228
we're talking about
a thermodynamic miracle.

28:32.812 --> 28:34.019
A what?

28:34.103 --> 28:35.853
A thermodynamic
miracle.

28:35.937 --> 28:38.395
It's the sciencey
version of, uh,

28:38.478 --> 28:40.853
"It's all connected, man."

28:41.353 --> 28:43.937
My ex used to talk
about them, when he wasn't

28:44.019 --> 28:46.269
distracted by
fucking quarks.

28:46.353 --> 28:48.853
He sounds like
a lot of fun.

28:48.937 --> 28:51.645
Yeah, well,
he's no Cal.

28:52.144 --> 28:55.061
-Excuse me?
-Cal, your husband.

28:55.144 --> 28:56.770
I saw him today.
We had a nice chat.

28:56.853 --> 28:58.478
You went to my house?

28:58.561 --> 29:00.353
Yeah. It's very nice.

29:00.436 --> 29:02.228
You guys met
in Vietnam, huh?

29:02.311 --> 29:04.478
You have family there?

29:05.061 --> 29:08.311
No. My parents died
when I was little.

29:09.478 --> 29:11.853
Oh, an orphan.

29:11.937 --> 29:13.895
That makes sense.

29:13.978 --> 29:15.978
How so?

29:16.061 --> 29:17.186
Well,

29:17.269 --> 29:19.937
people who wear masks
are driven by trauma.

29:20.019 --> 29:21.353
They're obsessed
with justice

29:21.436 --> 29:23.395
because of some
injustice they suffered,

29:23.478 --> 29:24.812
usually when
they were kids.

29:24.895 --> 29:26.895
Ergo, the mask.
It hides the pain.

29:26.978 --> 29:29.395
I wear the mask
to protect myself.

29:29.478 --> 29:31.645
Right. From the pain.

29:32.687 --> 29:33.770
So...

29:33.853 --> 29:36.269
did nuns murder
your parents?

29:36.353 --> 29:38.061
Or were you raised by nuns

29:38.144 --> 29:40.019
after your parents
were murdered?

29:40.103 --> 29:41.603
Uh, no judgment.

29:41.687 --> 29:43.937
I used to dress up
and fight bad guys, too.

29:44.019 --> 29:45.478
Oh, really?

29:45.561 --> 29:47.687
And what was your trauma?

29:48.853 --> 29:50.687
Petey, go ahead.
Tell her.

29:51.353 --> 29:53.103
Uh, what?

29:53.186 --> 29:54.937
Petey's kind of an expert
on me and all the yahoos

29:55.019 --> 29:56.478
I used to run around with.

29:56.561 --> 29:59.019
Go ahead, tell Sister Night
about my trauma.

30:00.019 --> 30:01.770
-Really?
-Absolutely!

30:01.853 --> 30:03.687
There are no
secrets in this car.

30:04.061 --> 30:05.687
Okay.

30:06.353 --> 30:08.103
Agent Blake's
parents were

30:08.186 --> 30:11.395
the Comedian
and Silk Spectre.

30:12.186 --> 30:14.687
They were both
in the Minutemen.

30:14.770 --> 30:16.812
Minutemen,
like the TV show?

30:16.895 --> 30:18.478
That show is garbage.

30:18.561 --> 30:20.937
It's the... Mm-mm.

30:21.019 --> 30:23.144
It's full of
historical inaccuracies.

30:23.228 --> 30:25.019
In the real world,

30:25.103 --> 30:28.603
the Comedian sexually
assaulted Silk Spectre,

30:28.687 --> 30:30.311
back in the '40s.

30:30.395 --> 30:32.687
Agent Blake didn't
find out till

30:32.770 --> 30:35.186
much, much later.

30:36.019 --> 30:38.728
He-- her dad tried
to rape her mom.

30:41.645 --> 30:43.353
Well...

30:43.436 --> 30:46.228
I'm so glad we got this time
to know each other better.

30:46.687 --> 30:48.395
We're here.

30:48.895 --> 30:51.228
You might wanna...

30:52.186 --> 30:54.728
protect yourself.

31:21.687 --> 31:25.311
(whirring, warbling)

31:38.019 --> 31:40.895
How many of these
things you people have?

31:40.978 --> 31:43.103
Just these six.

31:43.478 --> 31:45.561
What's the range
on them?

31:45.645 --> 31:48.186
100 kilometers,
give or take.

31:50.436 --> 31:52.645
So, it's possible
to, say,

31:52.728 --> 31:54.603
fly one out
of here and...

31:54.687 --> 31:58.520
vwoot... pick up a car
in downtown Greenwood?

32:00.311 --> 32:03.019
Why would we do that?

32:03.103 --> 32:04.895
You mind giving me a list
of everybody who was here

32:04.978 --> 32:06.687
last night who knows
how to fly these things?

32:06.770 --> 32:08.061
Sorry. I'm not
authorized--

32:08.144 --> 32:10.353
Girl:
I'll take it from here, Selma.

32:11.478 --> 32:13.812
Hello. My name is Bian.

32:14.144 --> 32:17.478
I'd be happy to provide you with
the information you requested.

32:18.311 --> 32:20.478
Traditionally,
my mother relegates

32:20.561 --> 32:23.228
interactions with
the authorities to underlings,

32:23.311 --> 32:25.603
but in this case,
she'd like to invite you

32:25.687 --> 32:27.603
to have tea in her vivarium.

32:27.687 --> 32:30.061
May I show
you the way?

32:30.144 --> 32:33.061
Ooh-la-la. Please do.

32:40.520 --> 32:43.186
So sorry. Ladies only.

32:47.436 --> 32:49.853
I'll, uh,
wait in the car.

32:50.853 --> 32:53.687
Bian:
The Colossus of Rhodes
was swallowed by the sea.

32:53.770 --> 32:57.436
The Lighthouse at Alexandria,
toppled by earthquakes.

32:57.520 --> 32:59.645
Not one of them
built to last.

32:59.728 --> 33:03.645
Blake: So, you're building
the Eighth Wonder of the World?

33:03.728 --> 33:05.144
Bian:
No.

33:05.228 --> 33:07.937
The First Wonder
of the New World.

33:08.895 --> 33:11.186
A thousand miles
from the nearest ocean,

33:11.269 --> 33:13.812
fortified and impervious
to seismic activity,

33:13.895 --> 33:17.228
and anything short of
a direct nuclear blast.

33:20.186 --> 33:21.269
(beeping)

33:21.353 --> 33:24.395
-Night: What does it do?
-(door opening)

33:24.478 --> 33:25.978
It tells time.

33:26.061 --> 33:28.019
(birds chirping)

33:40.895 --> 33:42.937
Agent Blake.

33:44.269 --> 33:46.061
Detective Night.

33:46.144 --> 33:48.269
Please, come in.

33:50.561 --> 33:53.395
-I'm Lady Trieu.
-Nice to meet you.

33:55.603 --> 33:57.269
I'm sorry about the humidity.

33:57.687 --> 33:59.978
We have to get it just
right for the plants.

34:00.061 --> 34:01.937
On her deathbed,
my mother made me promise

34:02.019 --> 34:05.436
I would never leave Vietnam,
so I found a loophole.

34:05.520 --> 34:07.269
Now, Vietnam never leaves me.

34:08.853 --> 34:10.019
Small world.

34:10.103 --> 34:13.269
Detective Night here is
from Vietnam as well.

34:13.353 --> 34:14.645
Really?

34:15.228 --> 34:16.353
What a coincidence.

34:16.436 --> 34:18.937
At least
a thermodynamic miracle.

34:19.019 --> 34:21.353
So, I understand
you think

34:21.436 --> 34:24.687
a piece of our equipment
was used to steal a vehicle?

34:24.770 --> 34:26.520
Well, actually,
we found the car.

34:26.603 --> 34:29.895
Whoever took it dropped it right
back where they stole it from.

34:29.978 --> 34:30.937
Oh.

34:32.645 --> 34:34.186
That's odd.

34:34.269 --> 34:35.978
It is odd.

34:36.061 --> 34:37.895
May I ask who
the car belonged to?

34:37.978 --> 34:41.144
-Blake: Well actually,
that's irrelevant--
-It's mine.

34:42.311 --> 34:44.478
So, this is personal?

34:45.520 --> 34:47.895
Your daughter said that
she would give us a list

34:47.978 --> 34:50.728
of everybody who knows how
to fly one of those things.

34:50.812 --> 34:53.687
Of course. Bian.

34:59.061 --> 35:01.269
If there is anything
else we can do to help,

35:01.353 --> 35:02.937
don't hesitate
to ask.

35:04.103 --> 35:05.853
And please accept
my condolences

35:05.978 --> 35:07.603
on the passing
of your chief.

35:07.687 --> 35:08.687
We never met personally,

35:08.770 --> 35:11.395
but I hear he was a great man.

35:13.061 --> 35:14.978
Thanks.

35:15.561 --> 35:17.603
There's an expression
about grief I remember

35:17.687 --> 35:19.561
from when
I was little.

35:20.353 --> 35:23.019
(speaks Vietnamese)

35:25.395 --> 35:28.895
I remember one from
when I was little, too.

35:28.978 --> 35:31.687
(speaks Vietnamese)

35:36.687 --> 35:38.603
I haven't heard that one.

35:38.687 --> 35:41.019
It's quite beautiful.

35:41.103 --> 35:42.728
Blake:
Holy shit!

35:43.728 --> 35:45.895
Is that Adrian Veidt?

35:46.853 --> 35:48.812
Indeed it is.

35:48.895 --> 35:50.561
A truly great man.

35:52.395 --> 35:54.895
So much of my success
grew from the seed

35:54.978 --> 35:57.019
of his inspiration.

35:57.436 --> 36:00.770
And you bought his company
right after he disappeared.

36:00.853 --> 36:02.436
That, too.

36:03.687 --> 36:06.603
Why'd you have them
make him so... old?

36:08.144 --> 36:10.228
Because he is old.

36:10.311 --> 36:11.311
In my culture,

36:11.395 --> 36:14.019
our elders
are revered.

36:14.561 --> 36:17.937
Well, yeah, but this is
America, sweetheart, and...

36:18.019 --> 36:19.603
he looks like shit.

36:46.478 --> 36:48.812
What have we got here?

36:55.687 --> 36:57.061
(sighs)

36:59.061 --> 36:59.978
(coughs)

37:00.895 --> 37:02.269
(mutters):

Happy birthday.

39:18.603 --> 39:20.186
Welcome to the manor.

39:20.269 --> 39:23.520
I am your master.

39:23.603 --> 39:26.895
You are still
a few hours away...

39:26.978 --> 39:30.353
from gaining
the ability to speak,

39:30.436 --> 39:32.436
but by now,
you should be able

39:32.520 --> 39:34.395
to understand.

39:36.436 --> 39:38.395
Do you know what you are?

39:40.186 --> 39:42.019
(sighs)

39:42.103 --> 39:43.812
No...

39:43.895 --> 39:45.520
Of course you don't.

39:45.603 --> 39:49.561
You are flaws in this
thoughtless design.

39:49.937 --> 39:52.353
For while I may be your master,

39:52.436 --> 39:56.269
I am most definitely not
your maker.

39:56.353 --> 39:58.687
I would never have...

39:58.770 --> 40:02.353
burdened such
pathetic creatures...

40:03.353 --> 40:04.645
(sighs)

40:04.728 --> 40:07.561
...with the gift of life.

40:07.645 --> 40:09.812
For to be alive,

40:10.395 --> 40:12.269
you have to have purpose,

40:12.812 --> 40:14.812
and you have none.

40:16.186 --> 40:19.603
Except... to serve.

40:22.645 --> 40:25.770
(flies buzzing)

40:30.978 --> 40:33.520
Well, I apologize for the mess.

40:48.019 --> 40:49.561
Hmm.

40:52.144 --> 40:54.311
I had a rough night.

40:56.061 --> 40:57.687
(sighs)

41:01.645 --> 41:03.853
I don't need it yet.

41:03.937 --> 41:05.520
(clanks)

41:12.687 --> 41:14.812
Not yet.

41:17.603 --> 41:19.269
Veidt: Excellent!

41:19.645 --> 41:22.478
So, are we loaded, Mr. Philips?

41:22.561 --> 41:24.186
Ready, Master!

41:24.269 --> 41:26.520
Veidt:
On my mark, Ms. Crookshanks!

41:28.061 --> 41:29.937
Three, two,

41:30.687 --> 41:32.144
one,

41:32.228 --> 41:33.853
away!

41:40.937 --> 41:42.770
Phenomenal!

41:44.645 --> 41:46.520
Let's reload,
Mr. Philips, shall we?

42:01.436 --> 42:03.436
Four years.

42:03.978 --> 42:07.228
Four years since
I was sent here.

42:08.311 --> 42:11.603
In the beginning,
I thought it was a paradise.

42:13.019 --> 42:15.144
But it's not.

42:16.103 --> 42:17.770
It's a prison.

42:19.353 --> 42:20.937
So...

42:22.269 --> 42:24.269
with your help,

42:24.353 --> 42:26.353
with your lives,

42:26.436 --> 42:28.269
with your...

42:28.353 --> 42:31.228
broken, mangled old bodies,

42:31.311 --> 42:34.019
one way or another,

42:34.103 --> 42:37.937
I will escape this
godforsaken place.

42:38.770 --> 42:40.645
To your merits,
Ms. Crookshanks!

42:40.728 --> 42:42.269
-Are we loaded, Mr. Philips?
-Yes, sir.

42:42.353 --> 42:44.645
On my mark, Ms. Crookshanks!

42:45.144 --> 42:46.395
Three,

42:46.478 --> 42:48.978
two, one,

42:49.061 --> 42:50.812
away!

43:02.645 --> 43:05.812
(crickets chirring)

43:35.770 --> 43:37.895
What are you reading?

43:38.687 --> 43:40.853
Things Fall Apart.

43:43.687 --> 43:46.687
Okonkwo hangs
himself in the end.

43:47.853 --> 43:49.520
Thanks for the warning.

43:51.436 --> 43:53.478
I'm trying
to pick a fight.

43:56.687 --> 43:58.019
I noticed.

44:00.520 --> 44:02.228
When were you gonna
tell me that the woman

44:02.311 --> 44:05.353
from the FBI came by
and talked to you?

44:07.019 --> 44:10.353
The woman from the FBI
came by, talked to me.

44:12.603 --> 44:14.186
She wanted to know
who called the house

44:14.269 --> 44:16.186
the night Judd got killed.

44:17.353 --> 44:19.978
Guess she must've checked
the phone records.

44:20.061 --> 44:22.144
So, what'd you say?

44:22.228 --> 44:24.269
I told her you and I
were having sex

44:24.353 --> 44:26.561
in the closet
when the phone rang.

44:27.228 --> 44:29.478
You answered, but...

44:29.561 --> 44:31.770
I didn't know who
you were talking to.

44:33.144 --> 44:35.895
Then you handed me
a gun and left.

44:36.603 --> 44:38.269
I didn't see you
all night long,

44:38.353 --> 44:40.061
and the next morning,
you came back and told me

44:40.144 --> 44:43.728
your grandfather murdered
our friend, which was...

44:45.061 --> 44:47.228
confusing because...

44:47.937 --> 44:50.269
you never told me
you had a grandfather.

44:50.812 --> 44:52.812
You didn't say any of that.

44:52.895 --> 44:55.228
No, Angela.

44:56.103 --> 44:57.436
I lied.

44:58.019 --> 45:00.144
And you hate lying.

45:02.019 --> 45:04.436
I do.

45:15.687 --> 45:16.645
(sighs)

45:16.728 --> 45:19.937
She knew that we met in Vietnam.

45:22.728 --> 45:24.353
Did you...

45:24.436 --> 45:26.603
tell her about your accident?

45:28.061 --> 45:29.728
It didn't come up.

45:30.770 --> 45:32.937
(sighs) Good.

45:37.478 --> 45:39.687
I think she wants to help you.

45:41.144 --> 45:42.478
Why?

45:44.269 --> 45:47.603
It's just a feeling I have.
Maybe she knows how to find him.

45:48.853 --> 45:50.103
The old man.

45:50.978 --> 45:53.520
I can find him all by myself.

45:55.186 --> 45:56.812
Okay.

45:58.687 --> 46:00.812
(sighs)

46:03.978 --> 46:05.645
Meet you in the closet.

46:16.853 --> 46:19.812
(gasping)

46:49.520 --> 46:50.978
Mom?

46:51.061 --> 46:52.687
What's wrong?

46:53.978 --> 46:56.186
I had a nightmare.

47:07.228 --> 47:09.395
I was in a village.

47:10.228 --> 47:11.895
Men came...

47:13.353 --> 47:15.436
and burned it.

47:17.937 --> 47:20.103
And then
they made us walk.

47:21.978 --> 47:24.687

for so long.

Good night,

48:18.478 --> 48:19.812

48:21.311 --> 48:23.019
You're worried.

48:23.812 --> 48:25.144
I'm not worried.

48:25.895 --> 48:27.061

48:27.144 --> 48:28.895

who you are, just tell her.

She's not gonna listen.

48:38.436 --> 48:41.436

things by herself.

48:42.978 --> 48:44.853

-Oh yeah?

48:44.937 --> 48:47.770

the same thing to your daughter?

49:52.353 --> 49:54.603

49:54.687 --> 49:56.895

49:56.978 --> 49:59.186
