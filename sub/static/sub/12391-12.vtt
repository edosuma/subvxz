WEBVTT

00:02.330 --> 00:03.524
PUT THAT DOWN.

00:03.570 --> 00:04.423
WE'RE NOT HERE
TO FEED THE BIRDS.

00:04.470 --> 00:07.030
THAT'S JUST A COVER
TO THROW YOUR DAD OFF.

00:07.070 --> 00:08.697
WELL, IF WE'RE NOT HERE
TO FEED THE BIRDS,

00:08.740 --> 00:09.707
WHAT ARE WE HERE
TO DO, GRANDPA?

00:09.740 --> 00:13.039
WE'RE HERE TO GIRL WATCH.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.378
EVERYTHING THEY DO
IS MAGICAL...

00:15.410 --> 00:16.707
MYSTERIOUS. ..

00:16.750 --> 00:20.174
YOUR GRANDMOTHER WAS
A LIFETIME OF SURPRISES.

00:20.220 --> 00:21.778
NOW, WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT HER?

00:24.820 --> 00:27.357
SHE'S A SURFER.
SHE'S GOOFY-FOOTED.

00:27.390 --> 00:28.687
GOOFY?

00:28.720 --> 00:29.687
LEFT-HANDED,
BUT WITH HER FEET.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.789
NO, STOP.
STOP THAT RIGHT NOW.

00:31.830 --> 00:34.719
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO PROFILE HER,

00:34.760 --> 00:35.658
OR TELL ME WHO SHE ACTUALLY IS.

00:35.700 --> 00:38.066
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
WHO YOU THINK SHE IS.

00:38.100 --> 00:41.729
WHAT SHE LIKES.
WHAT SHE DREAMS ABOUT.

00:41.770 --> 00:43.601
USE YOUR IMAGINATION.

00:43.640 --> 00:49.078
WELL, THEN HER NAME
IS LARSA VON LYKENHOFFER.

00:49.110 --> 00:50.270
GERMAN BROAD, GOOD.
WHAT ELSE?

00:50.310 --> 00:51.538
WHAT ELSE?

00:51.580 --> 00:55.641
AND SHE'S A GIRAFFE WRANGLER
AND A TEST PILOT.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.147
AND IT'S POSSIBLE
SHE'S A MANIMAL.

00:57.190 --> 00:58.680
[laughs]

00:58.720 --> 01:00.187
SHAWN, I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO FINISH THE DISHES

01:00.220 --> 01:01.858
BEFORE YOU FEED THE BIRDS.

01:01.890 --> 01:03.482
DAD, SHAWN'S GOT CHORES
THAT COME

01:03.530 --> 01:04.849
BEFORE GOOFIN' OFF
AT THE BEACH.

01:04.890 --> 01:06.858
LET ME RELAX
WITH MY GRANDSON.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.788
WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING EXACTLY?

01:08.830 --> 01:12.334
JUST BEACH GAZING.
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

01:12.370 --> 01:13.564
I UNDERSTAND.

01:13.600 --> 01:16.763
YOU WANNA BEACH GAZE?
SCOOT OVER.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.664
YOU WANNA BEACH GAZE.
WE'LL ALL BEACH GAZE.

01:18.710 --> 01:21.804
CLOSE YOUR EYES, SHAWN.

01:21.840 --> 01:22.704
HOW MANY TOWELS
WITH RED STRIPES?

01:22.750 --> 01:25.207
OH, HERE WE GO
WITH THE TOWEL THING AGAIN.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.569
FOUR.

01:26.620 --> 01:29.783
HENRY, DO YOU HAVE TO DRAIN
THE FUN OUT OF EVERYTHING?

01:29.820 --> 01:31.685
DAD, I WANT YOU TO LEAVE
THE RAISING OF MY SON TO ME.

01:31.720 --> 01:33.358
ALL RIGHT?

01:33.390 --> 01:34.618
HE'S GOT RESPONSIBILITIES.

01:34.660 --> 01:37.481
AND YOU, YOU, BE'I'I'ER BE
TWO STEPS BEHIND ME.

01:37.530 --> 01:40.328
'CAUSE YOU GOT A DATE
WITH SOME SUDS AND A SPONGE.

01:43.430 --> 01:44.829
DO ME A FAVOR, SHAWN.

01:44.870 --> 01:47.759
SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA LET
WHAT YOUR DAD SAYS

01:47.800 --> 01:49.609
FLOAT THROUGH THE EARS.

01:49.640 --> 01:52.279
MAKE YOUR OWN CHOICES.

01:52.310 --> 01:54.608
DON'T TAKE LIFE TOO SERIOUSLY.

01:54.640 --> 01:57.871
TRAVEL THE WORLD.
MEET INTERESTING PEOPLE.

01:57.910 --> 01:59.775
HAVE SOME ADVENTURES.

01:59.820 --> 02:02.448
BECAUSE SOME DAY YOU'RE
GONNA WAKE UP AND REALIZE

02:02.490 --> 02:04.879
YOU'RE TOO OLD
TO DO ANYTHING REALLY FUN.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.353
YES, GRANDPA.

02:06.390 --> 02:07.880
THIS ISN'T
GONNA WORK, SHAWN.

02:07.920 --> 02:08.750
IT'S GONNA WORK.

02:08.790 --> 02:10.621
WE'VE FAILED
TO GET IN HERE SIX TIMES.

02:10.660 --> 02:11.820
WE HAVEN'T GO'I'I'EN
TO ONE WITNESS.

02:11.860 --> 02:13.828
WE HAVEN'T SEEN WHERE THE
MISSING MAN DISAPPEARED FROM.

02:13.860 --> 02:15.794
THIS PLACE IS A FORTRESS.

02:17.370 --> 02:18.769
I THINK
YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.

02:18.800 --> 02:19.892
MAYBE WE SHOULD CRAWL.

02:19.940 --> 02:23.706
I'M NOT CRAWLING
ON THIS WET GRASS.

02:23.740 --> 02:24.900
DUDE.

02:24.940 --> 02:26.407
I READ AN ARTICLE

02:26.440 --> 02:29.648
THAT SAYS 90%
OF HIGH-VOLTAGE SIGNS ARE BOGUS.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.170
THEY JUST HANG THEM UP THERE
TO SCARE PEOPLE OFF.

02:31.210 --> 02:32.939
GOOD THEORY.
YOU TEST IT.

02:32.980 --> 02:34.743
I CAN'T TOUCH THAT.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.338
I CONDUCT WAY MORE ELECTRICITY
THAN YOU.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.880
YOU KNOW THAT.

02:37.920 --> 02:38.818
TOUCH IT.
JUST USE YOUR FINGERTIP.

02:38.850 --> 02:41.455
I'M NOT TOUCHING
AN ELECTRIFIED FENCE, SHAWN.

02:41.490 --> 02:44.789
HOW ABOUT I TOUCH IT?

02:44.830 --> 02:46.923
I DON'T THINK I LIKE
THE WAY THAT SOUNDS.

02:46.960 --> 02:49.599
AH!

02:54.970 --> 02:56.961
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TWO DOING
WITH MY STUFF?

02:57.010 --> 02:57.965
WE NEED TOOLS.

02:58.010 --> 02:58.965
FOR WHAT?

02:59.010 --> 03:02.741
[sighs]

03:02.780 --> 03:05.442
IF YOU MUST ASK,
IT'S FOR A STAKEOUT, OKAY.

03:05.480 --> 03:07.812
WE'VE GOT A TOUGH CASE, AND OUR
BINOCULARS ONLY GO UP TO 2X.

03:07.850 --> 03:09.317
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH MY COOLER?

03:09.350 --> 03:10.886
WE HAVE TO KEEP THE GELATO COLD
IN THE CAR.

03:10.920 --> 03:12.785
YOU TWO GIRLS ARE USELESS--
SHAWN, DIDN'T YOU LEARN ANYTHING

03:12.820 --> 03:13.912
I EVER TAUGHT YOU
ABOUT SURVEILLANCE?

03:13.960 --> 03:16.622
WE HAPPEN
TO BE AWESOME AT COVERT OPS.

03:16.660 --> 03:17.922
WE JUST RAN
INTO A BIT OF A GAUNTLET,

03:17.960 --> 03:19.552
AND TOOK A MISSING PERSON CASE

03:19.600 --> 03:21.625
BASED IN AN EXTREMELY
DIFFICULT PLACE TO CRACK.

03:21.660 --> 03:22.888
UH-HUH.

03:22.930 --> 03:24.693
WHAT IMPENETRABLE STRONGHOLD

03:24.730 --> 03:26.197
DID THIS MISSING PERSON
DISAPPEAR FROM?

03:30.740 --> 03:31.764
[quietly]
GLORIOUS PINES.

03:31.810 --> 03:33.004
SAY AGAIN.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.873
GLORIOUS PINES.

03:35.910 --> 03:37.309
THE OLD AGE HOME?

03:37.350 --> 03:39.545
IT'S A RETIREMENT COMMUNITY.

03:39.580 --> 03:42.583
IT'S TOP-OF-TH E-LINE
IN INDEPENDENT SENIOR LIVING,

03:42.620 --> 03:43.882
WITH A FULL-TIME SECURITY TEAM.

03:43.920 --> 03:45.717
MY SON, THE SUPER SLEUTH,

03:45.750 --> 03:48.685
CAN'T EVEN GET HIMSELF ACCESS
INTO AN OLD FOLKS HOME.

03:48.720 --> 03:49.857
NO-NO-NO-NO, DAD.

03:49.890 --> 03:50.925
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST.

03:50.960 --> 03:51.881
OKAY.
I TRIED EVERYTHING.

03:51.930 --> 03:52.897
I TRIED THE WHOLE,

03:52.930 --> 03:54.397
"I'M A TRAVELING DOULA" BIT.

03:54.430 --> 03:57.399
"THE DINGO ATE MY BABY" ROUTINE.

03:57.430 --> 03:58.863
HIDING GUS IN A SACK TRICK,
WHICH NEVER FAILS.

03:58.900 --> 03:59.867
TRUST ME.

03:59.900 --> 04:01.492
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE GOTI'EN
ANY CLOSER THAN WE DID.

04:01.540 --> 04:03.269
GIVE ME A BREAK.

04:03.310 --> 04:05.005
I'LL BE IN THAT JOINT,
CRACK THE CASE IN EIGHT MINUTES.

04:05.040 --> 04:09.443
[laughs]

04:09.480 --> 04:10.799
OKAY, YEAH.
TOMORROW.

04:10.850 --> 04:11.874
IT'S ON.
SHOW US HOW IT'S DONE.

04:11.910 --> 04:14.515
NO, WAIT, JUST HOLD ON A SECOND.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO--

04:14.550 --> 04:15.869
EXACTLY.

04:15.920 --> 04:19.048
6:00 AM. SHARP.

04:19.090 --> 04:21.615
THAT'S TOO EARLY.

04:21.660 --> 04:22.627
HOW ABOUT 9:00?

04:22.660 --> 04:23.729
9:00'S A LITTLE LATE.

04:23.760 --> 04:24.920
COME ON, GUYS.
LET'S BE REASONABLE.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.427
JUST SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE.
OKAY?

04:26.460 --> 04:27.427
CALL IT 11:15.

04:27.460 --> 04:28.825
6:00 IT IS.

04:28.860 --> 04:29.861
I'LL DRIVE.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.789
YOU SURE YOU WANNA PARK
THIS CLOSE, DAD?

04:33.840 --> 04:35.432
WE'RE ALMOST
A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY.

04:35.470 --> 04:37.734
SHAWN, WE'RE EXACTLY WHERE
WE SHOULD BE

04:37.770 --> 04:38.998
TO GET A READ
ON THE SITUATION.

04:39.040 --> 04:40.007
I CAN LITERALLY SEE
THE CURVATURE OF THE EARTH

04:40.040 --> 04:41.803
FROM HERE.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.000
YOU KNOW, SHAWN, WHY DON'T YOU
HONK THE HORN AND LET THEM KNOW

04:43.050 --> 04:44.403
THAT WE'RE HERE
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT?

04:44.450 --> 04:48.978
WHO IS THIS MISSING GUY?

04:49.020 --> 04:51.341
OSWALD CHESTER,
RESIDENT, 73 YEARS OLD.

04:51.390 --> 04:52.687
HE'S BEEN MISSING
FOR THREE DAYS.

04:52.720 --> 04:54.859
AND WHAT WE'VE GATHERED
FROM OUR CLIENT IS,

04:54.890 --> 04:56.926
THE COMMUNITY IS TRYING
TO COVER IT UP.

04:56.960 --> 04:59.019
(Henry)
YOUR CLIENT WENT
TO THE POLICE ALREADY?

04:59.060 --> 05:00.049
I DON'T KNOW, DAD.
WE DIDN'T GET THAT FAR.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.852
WHAT?
YOU DIDN'T ASK THE QUESTION?

05:01.900 --> 05:03.720
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, SHAWN,
DIDN'T YOU LEARN ANYTHING

05:03.770 --> 05:05.522
THAT I TRIED TO TE--
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH
OF THIS NONSENSE.

05:05.570 --> 05:07.458
NO, NOT ENOUGH.
WE'VE JUST STARTED.

05:11.440 --> 05:12.702
(Henry)
SLOW DOWN, WOULD YOU?

05:12.740 --> 05:14.002
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
MARCH RIGHT IN THERE?

05:14.040 --> 05:15.905
(Gus)
THAT LOOKS
TO BE THE PLAN.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.908
NO WONDER YOU GUYS ARE FAILING
SO BADLY.

05:17.950 --> 05:19.747
RULE NUMBER ONE, NEVER MAKE
YOURSELF KNOWN TO YOUR TARGET.

05:19.780 --> 05:20.747
RULE NUMBER TWO--

05:20.780 --> 05:21.542
DAD, YOU GOT
YOUR GLASSES?

05:21.580 --> 05:22.888
YEAH, OF COURSE
I GOT MY GLASSES.

05:22.920 --> 05:23.887
GOOD.
GO AHEAD AND PUT 'EM ON.

05:23.920 --> 05:24.887
WHAT?

05:24.920 --> 05:26.114
HERE. GIVE ME THAT.

05:26.150 --> 05:27.617
OH, A DISGUISE.
LOOK AT YOU GO.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.480
RIGHT OUT OF THE PRIVATE EYE
HANDBOOK, HUH?

05:29.530 --> 05:32.624
HERE.
PUT THIS ON TOO.

05:32.660 --> 05:35.094
THIS THING'S LIKE 100 YEARS OLD.

05:35.130 --> 05:36.427
WHAT--SHAWN--

05:36.470 --> 05:37.960
I LOOK LIKE HENRY FONDA.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.094
ALLOW ME TO APOLOGIZE
IN ADVANCE FOR THIS.

05:41.140 --> 05:42.437
AH--HOT.

05:42.470 --> 05:44.028
WHAT THE HELL, SHAWN?

05:44.070 --> 05:45.105
WHAT THE HELL?

05:45.140 --> 05:45.959
HOLD THIS FOR A SECOND.

05:46.010 --> 05:48.069
WHAT?

05:48.110 --> 05:49.077
MAY I HELP YOU?

05:49.110 --> 05:50.998
YES.
PAMELA, IS IT?

05:51.050 --> 05:52.574
THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

05:52.620 --> 05:53.609
MAY I HELP YOU?

05:53.650 --> 05:55.538
WE ARE HERE
TO CHECK SOMEBODY IN.

05:55.580 --> 05:57.411
REALLY?
AND WHO MIGHT THAT BE?

05:57.450 --> 06:00.510
MY GRANDFATHER.

06:07.530 --> 06:10.419
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

06:10.470 --> 06:11.425
*

06:11.470 --> 06:12.994
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

06:13.040 --> 06:14.496
* THAT I'M NOT TELLING
THE TRUTH *

06:14.540 --> 06:16.030
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

06:16.070 --> 06:18.766
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

06:18.810 --> 06:20.038
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

06:20.080 --> 06:21.433
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

06:21.480 --> 06:23.004
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

06:23.050 --> 06:25.541
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

06:25.580 --> 06:28.572
* I KNOW YOU KNOW *

06:30.990 --> 06:31.911
I'M NOT DOING THIS.
NO, SHAWN.
GRAMPY.

06:31.950 --> 06:35.454
CALM BLUE OCEAN.
CALM BLUE OCEAN.

06:35.490 --> 06:37.549
GO TO YOUR QUIET PLACE.
I'M SORRY.

06:37.590 --> 06:39.148
BUT WE DON'T ACCEPT
WALK-IN ADMISSIONS.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.021
THERE'S AN APPLICATION
AND A VERY LONG WAITING LIST.

06:41.060 --> 06:42.095
UH, FINE.
WE'RE LEAVING.

06:42.130 --> 06:43.620
NO-NO-NO.
ABSOLUTELY.

06:43.670 --> 06:44.921
HE--HE JUST GOT IN
OFF THE WAITING LIST.

06:44.970 --> 06:46.096
I'M NOT
ON ANY DAMN WAITING LIST.

06:46.130 --> 06:48.564
PLEASE FORGIVE OUR GRAMPY HERE.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.932
HE GETS IRATE
AND A LITTLE FORGETFUL.

06:50.970 --> 06:54.007
YOU TWO ARE BROTHERS?

06:54.040 --> 06:57.544
OUR FATHER WORKED AT BENE'I'I'ON.

06:57.580 --> 06:59.514
AND WHAT'S
YOUR GRANDFATHER'S NAME?

06:59.550 --> 07:00.574
[laughs]

07:00.620 --> 07:03.509
TALMADGE MCGULAGER.

07:04.590 --> 07:08.879
JUST A MOMENT.

07:08.920 --> 07:11.480
TALMADGE MCGULAGER?
BRILLIANT.

07:11.530 --> 07:15.057
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

07:15.100 --> 07:16.567
THIS IS THE PART WHERE YOU GET
BLINDSIDED WITH PLAN B.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.090
IT'S KINDA FUN
WHEN IT'S NOT HAPPENING TO ME.

07:18.130 --> 07:19.666
LOOK, I'M GETTING US IN.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.133
RELAX, DAD.

07:21.170 --> 07:22.569
I MEAN, GRAN DPAPPY.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.168
THIS IS NEVER GONNA WORK.

07:24.210 --> 07:25.734
MR. MCGULAGER,

07:25.770 --> 07:28.136
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE ALL SET.

07:28.180 --> 07:30.000
WHAT?

07:30.050 --> 07:32.678
YOU'RE WHO
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.

07:32.720 --> 07:33.470
MY APOLOGIES.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.080
I'M PAMELA,
THE CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.587
MY GOODNESS,
YOU DON'T LOOK

07:37.620 --> 07:40.953
REMOTELY OLD ENOUGH
TO LIVE HERE.

07:40.990 --> 07:42.252
GRANDPAPA IS 72.

07:42.290 --> 07:44.053
IT'S TRUE.

07:44.090 --> 07:45.250
THE THING IS, HE USED
TO BE A MALE MODEL.

07:45.290 --> 07:46.325
THAT'S WHY HE LOOKS SO YOUNG--

07:46.360 --> 07:48.897
YOU CAN SEE HE HAD
A LOT OF PLASTIC SURGERY DONE.

07:48.930 --> 07:50.921
72?

07:50.970 --> 07:54.736
MY, MY, THEY HAVE DONE
MARVELOUS WORK.

07:54.770 --> 07:57.864
I WOULD HAVE GUESSED
59, 60 TOPS.

07:57.910 --> 07:58.934
ALL RIGHT, YOU LISTEN HERE,
LADY,

07:58.970 --> 08:01.006
I'M NOT A DAY OVER--
OPA!

08:01.040 --> 08:03.076
YOU BE SWEET TO PAMELA.
SHE'S HERE TO HELP US.

08:03.110 --> 08:04.668
SHE IS A HELPER.

08:04.710 --> 08:06.268
SORRY, PAMELA.

08:06.310 --> 08:09.711
HE'S GONE A LITTLE--
HOW CAN I PUT THIS ELOQUENTLY?

08:09.750 --> 08:10.842
[mouths words]

08:10.890 --> 08:13.017
I UNDERSTAND.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.585
A LOT OF OUR RESIDENTS
ARE HESITANT AT FIRST.

08:15.620 --> 08:18.623
EXCUSE ME
WHILE I GET SOME FORMS.

08:20.260 --> 08:24.094
ALL RIGHT, HOW DID YOU KNOW
ABOUT THIS TALMADGE?

08:24.130 --> 08:26.189
DAD, USE THE CANE.
IT REALLY HELPS SELL IT.

08:26.230 --> 08:28.664
(Henry)
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
YOU HAD THIS PLANNED ALL ALONG?

08:28.700 --> 08:31.009
I SNATCHED THIS OFF ONE
OF THE GUARDS THAT TOSSED US.

08:31.040 --> 08:34.305
ACCORDING TO THE SCHEDULE,
TALMADGE MCGULAGER WAS SUPPOSED

08:34.340 --> 08:35.739
TO CHECK IN LAST NIGHT.

08:35.780 --> 08:38.169
SO I CALLED MR. MCGULAGER
AND INFORMED HIM

08:38.210 --> 08:41.611
THAT THE COMMUNITY IS INFESTED
WITH AFRICAN GAMBIAN POUCH RATS.

08:41.650 --> 08:43.538
THE LARGEST RATS
IN THE WORLD.

08:43.590 --> 08:44.181
NICE.

08:44.220 --> 08:45.209
HE'LL BE BACK IN THREE DAYS.

08:45.250 --> 08:46.615
IT'S THE AMOUNT
OF TIME IT TAKES

08:46.660 --> 08:48.116
TO FLY IN AND DEPLOY

08:48.160 --> 08:49.115
THE POUCH RAT'S
NATURAL PREDATOR.

08:49.160 --> 08:50.957
THE SUDANESE BIRCH PELICAN.

08:50.990 --> 08:53.550
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY EXPECT ME
TO SPEND THREE DAYS HERE.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.693
NO-NO-NO.
WE'RE GONNA SOLVE IT IN TWO.

08:55.730 --> 08:59.268
THE THIRD DAY IS REALLY MORE
ABOUT REFLECTION.

08:59.300 --> 09:00.938
BESIDES, WITH YOU IN HERE,
WE'LL BE ABLE

09:00.970 --> 09:02.335
TO GET VISITOR'S PASSES,
COME AND GO AS WE PLEASE.

09:02.370 --> 09:04.634
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, SHAWN.

09:04.670 --> 09:06.228
NORMALLY I'D STORM OU'I'I'A HERE.

09:06.270 --> 09:07.578
I'D LEAVE YOU
IN THE LURCH.

09:07.610 --> 09:09.009
BUT THIS TIME, KID,
JUST THIS TIME,

09:09.040 --> 09:10.678
I'M GONNA TEACH YOU A LESSON.

09:10.710 --> 09:13.816
I'LL BE
YOUR TALMADGE MAGRUDER.
MCGREGOR.

09:13.850 --> 09:14.817
MCGULAGER.

09:14.850 --> 09:16.044
EXACTLY.
I'LL BE ALL THOSE GUYS.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.048
AND I'LL HAVE
THIS CASE SOLVED BY LUNCH.

09:18.090 --> 09:19.045
[chuckles]

09:19.090 --> 09:20.352
CONSIDERING THEY EAT LUNCH HERE

09:20.390 --> 09:22.085
AT 10:15,
I'M GONNA SAY

09:22.120 --> 09:23.758
WE'LL HAVE IT DONE BY 9:45.

09:23.790 --> 09:25.348
YOU'RE ON.
YOU'RE ON.

09:25.390 --> 09:26.596
MR. MCGULAGER,

09:26.630 --> 09:28.097
WHY DON'T I SHOW YOU

09:28.130 --> 09:30.121
AROUND THE FACILITIES.
AND YOUR GRANDBOYS FILL OUT

09:30.170 --> 09:31.762
YOUR ADMISSIONS PAPERWORK?

09:31.800 --> 09:33.290
THAT'S A BRILLIANT IDEA, BOYS.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.329
WHY DON'T YOU GET RIGHT ON THAT?

09:34.370 --> 09:35.359
CAN WE FILL
THAT OUT LATER?

09:35.400 --> 09:36.367
WE'D REALLY LIKE
TO TAKE A LOOK

09:36.400 --> 09:37.901
AROUND AS WELL.

09:37.940 --> 09:39.771
YEAH, AND I HAVE A BIT
OF CARPAL TUNNEL GOING ON.

09:39.810 --> 09:40.777
WE'LL JUST TAG ALONG
IF THAT'S OKAY.

09:40.810 --> 09:41.902
YOU DON'T TAKE ONE STEP

09:41.940 --> 09:44.807
PAST THIS POINT UNTIL ALL
OF THESE FORMS ARE COMPLETE.

09:44.850 --> 09:47.045
THERE ARE TWO SIGNATURES
WHICH MUST BE IN BLUE.

09:47.080 --> 09:48.638
I'LL LET YOU FIGURE OUT
WHICH ONES THOSE ARE.

09:48.680 --> 09:50.580
LESTER HERE WILL CHECK
YOUR WORK WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

09:54.190 --> 09:56.055
(Juliet)
YOU WANTED TO SEE us, CHIEF?

09:56.090 --> 09:57.728
WHAT'S YOUR CASELOAD LIKE?

09:57.760 --> 09:58.852
LIGHT.
...ISH.

09:58.890 --> 10:00.323
GOOD ANSWER.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.657
BECAUSE I HAVE A SPECIAL
ASSIGNMENT THAT COMES DIRECTLY

10:01.700 --> 10:02.689
FROM THE MAYOR.

10:02.730 --> 10:03.697
THE MAYOR?

10:03.730 --> 10:05.266
REALLY?
YES.

10:05.300 --> 10:08.736
THERE'S YOUR ASSIGNMENT.

10:09.870 --> 10:12.703
[yells]

10:12.740 --> 10:15.004
IS HE A WITNESS
OR SOMETHING?

10:15.040 --> 10:16.940
NO, HE'S JUST
A DELINQUENT.

10:16.980 --> 10:18.902
HE'S BEEN PULLING OFF
SOME PENNY ANTE VANDAL STUFF.

10:18.950 --> 10:21.339
TAKING DOWN STREET SIGNS, CRAZY
GLUING PARKING METER SLOTS,

10:21.380 --> 10:23.280
REMOVING HOOD ORNAMENTS.

10:23.320 --> 10:24.287
NOTHING SERIOUS YET, BUT...

10:24.320 --> 10:26.311
AH, BUT THAT'S HOW IT STARTS.

10:26.350 --> 10:27.681
ONE MINUTE THEY'RE DESTROYING
PUBLIC PROPERTY,

10:27.720 --> 10:28.812
AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW

10:28.860 --> 10:29.986
THEY'RE SHOOTING COPS.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.281
SO WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO IS--

10:31.330 --> 10:32.854
NO, I KNOW EXACTLY
WHERE YOU WERE GOING

10:32.900 --> 10:33.992
WITH THIS THING, CHIEF.

10:34.030 --> 10:35.327
IT'S LIKE OUR BRAINS ARE JUST
CONNECTED ON THIS THING.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.089
I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

10:37.130 --> 10:38.961
HOW WE TRY THIS KID
AS AN ADULT.

10:41.340 --> 10:44.104
I NEED YOU TO DIAL IT BACK
ABOUT 50 NOTCHES,

10:44.140 --> 10:48.702
OR I WILL ASK YOU
TO PUT YOUR GUN ON MY DESK.

10:48.740 --> 10:51.072
WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO
IS STRAIGHTEN HIM OUT.

10:51.110 --> 10:52.145
SPEND A LITTLE TIME WITH HIM.

10:52.180 --> 10:54.671
TAKE HIM ON A RIDE-A-LONG.
NURTURE HIM.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.041
SHOW HIM WHAT A LIFE
OF CRIME LEADS TO.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.388
AND HE GETS
THIS SPECIAL TREATMENT BECAUSE?

10:59.420 --> 11:00.853
HIS MOTHER'S THE DEPUTY MAYOR,

11:00.890 --> 11:01.879
AND SHE DOESN'T WANT THE KID
IN THE SYSTEM.

11:01.920 --> 11:03.126
SO JUST FIX HIM.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.422
YES, MA'AM.

11:08.460 --> 11:11.065
I THINK ALL THAT WRITING GAVE ME
A GANGLION CYST.

11:11.100 --> 11:13.068
YOU CAN'T GET A CYST
FROM FILLING OUT PAPERWORK.

11:13.100 --> 11:15.068
IF THE PEN IS WRONG,
YOU CAN.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.294
THERE'S DEFINITELY
SOME CARPAL BOSSING IN THERE.

11:16.340 --> 11:17.136
WE SHOULD SEE
IF THEY HAVE

11:17.170 --> 11:19.035
SOME EXTRA THUMB SPLINTS
LYING AROUND.

11:19.070 --> 11:19.900
YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO?

11:19.940 --> 11:22.238
WE SHOULD ENROLL YOU
IN SOME MAN CLASSES.

11:22.280 --> 11:23.770
WELL, WELL, WELL.

11:23.810 --> 11:24.777
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

11:24.810 --> 11:26.175
WHILE YOU TWO GUYS WERE OFF

11:26.210 --> 11:27.416
DOTTIN' YOUR I'S
AND CROSSING YOUR T's,

11:27.450 --> 11:29.918
I WAS BUSY CRACKING YOUR CASE.

11:29.950 --> 11:31.417
IT WORKED.
YOU'RE FINALLY IN.

11:31.450 --> 11:32.951
(Henry)
WHO THE HELL IS HE?

11:32.990 --> 11:33.786
HE'S OUR CLIENT.

11:33.820 --> 11:35.219
(Henry)
YOU HAVE A GUY ON THE INSIDE,

11:35.260 --> 11:37.228
AND YOU NEEDED ME
TO GET YOU IN HERE, COME ON!

11:37.260 --> 11:40.024
I DIDN'T GET ALL THE CLEARANCES
I WAS HOPING FOR, OKAY?

11:40.060 --> 11:41.027
JERVIS WORKS HERE PART-TIME.

11:41.060 --> 11:43.028
HE DOESN'T EXACTLY GET
THE RESPECT HE DESERVES.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.719
[grunts]

11:44.770 --> 11:46.761
HEY!

11:46.800 --> 11:48.233
HOW THE HELL'D
YOU TWO GET IN HERE?

11:48.270 --> 11:49.237
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

11:49.270 --> 11:50.999
I DON'T THINK SO.
BAM!

11:51.040 --> 11:52.439
SAY IT WITH ME,

11:52.470 --> 11:55.007
* VIS-IT-OR'S BADGE

11:55.040 --> 11:56.007
* UH-HUH, UH-HUH

11:56.040 --> 11:57.439
DO SOMETHING.
I DARE YOU.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.471
I'LL BE WATCHING YOU.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.410
WE'LL BE GETTIN' WATCHED.

12:05.420 --> 12:06.444
WE GOTTA HURRY.

12:06.490 --> 12:08.811
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE OFF LAWN DUTY.

12:08.860 --> 12:09.827
I'LL SHOW YOU
WHERE YOU'RE SLEEPING.

12:09.860 --> 12:12.454
I'M NOT SLEEPIN' ANWVHERE.

12:12.490 --> 12:15.994
I AT LEAST GOT THEM
TO GIVE TALMADGE

12:16.030 --> 12:17.361
THE OTHER EMPTY BED
IN OSWALD'S ROOM.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.322
(Henry)
YEAH, YOU PRACTICALLY
OWN THE JOINT.

12:19.370 --> 12:22.066
JERVIS, GIVE HIM THE SCOOP,
SO HE'LL SHUT UP FOR A MINUTE.

12:22.100 --> 12:25.069
OSWALD DISAPPEARED
FROM THIS ROOM

12:25.110 --> 12:27.135
THREE MORNINGS AGO
WITHOUT A TRACE.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.499
MM-HMM, I'M GONNA ASK
THE FIRST QUESTION

12:28.540 --> 12:30.007
THAT MY SON
SHOULD HAVE ASKED.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.005
HAVE YOU TRIED
THE POLICE?

12:31.050 --> 12:33.041
[scoffs]
THE POLICE?

12:33.080 --> 12:35.969
THE POLICE COULDN'T CATCH BIRD
FLU AT A HONG KONG DUCK FARM.

12:36.020 --> 12:39.080
THEY BLEW ME OFF
JUST LIKE THE STAFF HERE DID.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.054
(Henry)
ANYTHING ELSE
YOU WANNA TELL US, MR. KENT?

12:41.090 --> 12:42.853
NO, NOT THAT I CAN THINK OF.

12:42.890 --> 12:44.152
ARE YOU SURE?

12:44.190 --> 12:45.828
DAD, WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?
JUST SPIT IT OUT.

12:45.860 --> 12:47.157
SHAWN, OSWALD CHESTER
DISAPPEARED

12:47.200 --> 12:48.519
FROM THESE GROUNDS
12 TIMES BEFORE.

12:48.560 --> 12:49.993
AND THE LAST
THREE INSTANCES

12:50.030 --> 12:51.361
THEY TH REATENED
TO THROW HIS ASS OUTTA HERE

12:51.400 --> 12:53.095
IF HE EVER DID IT AGAIN.

12:53.140 --> 12:55.165
DON'T YOU CHECK THESE NUTCASES
OUT BEFORE YOU TAKE 'EM ON?

12:55.200 --> 12:56.269
IS THAT TRUE,
JERVIS?

12:56.300 --> 12:57.562
UH, YES.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.907
DID YOU ALSO HAPPEN
TO MENTION TO MY SON

12:58.940 --> 13:00.999
THAT DURING THESE JAUNTS,

13:01.040 --> 13:03.008
THE COMMUNITY HERE FILLED OUT
A MISSING PERSONS REPORT.

13:03.050 --> 13:05.302
ONLY TO HAVE GOOD OLD OZZIE
POP UP THE NEXT DAY.

13:05.350 --> 13:07.170
GUYS, I KNOW
WHAT THIS SOUNDS LIKE.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.142
BUT OZZIE DID NOT RUN OFF
ON HIS OWN.

13:09.180 --> 13:10.147
NOT THIS TIME.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.248
AND YOU KNOW THIS HOW?

13:11.290 --> 13:13.986
HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND.

13:14.020 --> 13:17.126
I COULD ALWAYS TELL
WHEN HE WAS GETTING ANTSY,

13:17.160 --> 13:18.457
WHEN HE WANTED TO RUN.

13:18.490 --> 13:20.026
BUT THIS TIME
THERE WERE NO WARNING SIGNS.

13:20.060 --> 13:21.948
HE JUST VANISHED
INTO THIN AIR.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.026
JERVIS, LIFE LESSON NUMBER 20:
PEOPLE LIE.

13:25.070 --> 13:26.958
THEN THEY LEAVE
WITHOUT WARNING.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.195
LIFE SUCKS.

13:31.370 --> 13:32.337
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WAIT.

13:32.370 --> 13:34.201
I'M GETTING SOMETHING.

13:34.240 --> 13:35.537
IT'S STRONG.

13:35.580 --> 13:37.207
LEATH ERY.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.274
COULD BE ALLIGATOR.

13:38.310 --> 13:40.119
HE LEFT
WITHOUT HIS WALLET.

13:40.150 --> 13:41.117
HE DOESN'T HAVE HIS WALLET.

13:41.150 --> 13:43.482
THAT'S AMAZING.

13:43.520 --> 13:46.011
CAN'T GET VERY FAR WITHOUT CASH.
CAN YOU, POP?

13:46.050 --> 13:47.381
YEAH, AND ALL HIS CASH
AND CREDIT CARDS

13:47.420 --> 13:48.387
ARE STILL IN HIS WALLET.

13:48.420 --> 13:49.387
YOU WENT THROUGH HIS WALLET?

13:49.420 --> 13:51.024
OF COURSE I DID.

13:51.060 --> 13:52.152
I'M INVESTIGATING
THIS THING TOO, YOU KNOW.

13:52.190 --> 13:56.058
I HAVE A THEORY BASED ON
FORMALDEHYDE AND MIND CONTROL.

13:56.100 --> 13:57.988
JERVIS, DO YOU MIND
IF I CONFER

13:58.030 --> 14:00.089
WITH MY TWO GRANDSONS HERE
FOR A MOMENT

14:00.140 --> 14:01.630
WHILE WE WORK
THROUGH ALL THIS?

14:01.670 --> 14:03.399
BUT YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
MY IDENTICAL TWINS THEORY.

14:03.440 --> 14:04.407
FIRST THING TOMORROW MORNING.

14:04.440 --> 14:05.907
ALL RIGHT, SHAWN, COME ON.

14:05.940 --> 14:06.929
LET'S GO.
THERE IS NO CASE HERE.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.174
THIS GUY IS JUST AWOL.

14:08.210 --> 14:09.438
(Gus)
HEY, LOOK AT THIS.

14:09.480 --> 14:12.244
OSWALD WAS ON PRAZOSIN
FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.

14:12.280 --> 14:13.440
HA!

14:13.480 --> 14:15.948
WHY WOULD HE POSSIBLY LEAVE
WITHOUT HIS PARTALECSDNT. ..

14:15.980 --> 14:17.914
YOU CAN FILL THAT PRESCRIPTION
ANYWHERE, SHAWN.

14:17.950 --> 14:19.281
TSST.

14:31.330 --> 14:32.297
HE WENT RUNNING.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.093
WHAT?

14:34.140 --> 14:37.598
HE WAS TRAINING
FOR A MARATHON.

14:37.640 --> 14:39.631
THOSE NUMBERS ARE THE DISTANCES
HE WAS TRYING TO REACH.

14:39.670 --> 14:42.468
AND THE DATE THAT'S CIRCLED
IS THE SANTA BARBARA MARATHON.

14:42.510 --> 14:44.239
AND HOW
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

14:44.280 --> 14:47.272
EASY, IT'S THE SAME
AS VAL KILMER'S BIRTHDAY.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.276
WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT
WHERE HE WENT JOGGING.

14:49.320 --> 14:52.380
ALL RIGHT, SHAWN,
I'M GONNA HUMOR YA.

14:52.420 --> 14:55.014
LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.152
HUMOR ME?

14:56.190 --> 14:58.283
THAT WAS SPOT ON.

14:58.330 --> 15:00.127
IT'S LIKE ALMOND BUTTER
WITH HONEY.

15:00.160 --> 15:01.354
YOU ONLY KNOW THAT
BECAUSE YOU HAVE

15:01.400 --> 15:03.994
AN UNHEALTHY FASCINATION
WITH THE GUY FROM REAL GENIUS.

15:04.030 --> 15:05.361
OKAY, THAT'S IT.
YOU'RE NOT COMING WITH US.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.958
I AM GOING DOWN
TO THAT NAZI LADY

15:07.000 --> 15:08.228
AT THE FRONT DESK,
AND I AM HAVING

15:08.270 --> 15:09.464
YOUR IN/OUT PRIVILEGES REVOKED.

15:09.500 --> 15:10.637
OH, MR. MCGULAGER.

15:10.670 --> 15:12.501
THIS IS MEREDITH CLOVERFIELD.

15:12.540 --> 15:15.634
HI, I'M IN CHARGE
OF ROOM SERVICE HERE.

15:15.680 --> 15:17.147
SHE'S GONNA CHECK
ON YOUR SPECIAL DIETARY NEEDS.

15:17.180 --> 15:18.704
NOW, DO YOU HAVE
ANY DIGESTIVE ISSUES?

15:18.750 --> 15:20.115
NO, NO, NOT--

15:20.150 --> 15:22.414
DON'T LET HIM LIE
TO YOU, MISS CLOVERFIELD.

15:22.450 --> 15:23.417
HE HAS A VERY WEAK HEART.

15:23.450 --> 15:25.680
ALL HE CAN HAVE IS EGG WHITES
AND POWDERED DIRT.

15:25.720 --> 15:27.187
AND HE SHOULDN'T HAVE
ANY SOLID FOODS

15:27.220 --> 15:28.187
AFTER NOON.

15:28.220 --> 15:29.380
IS THAT TRUE?

15:29.420 --> 15:30.387
NO, NO.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.454
MY SON IS A LIAR.

15:31.490 --> 15:32.457
YOUR SON?

15:32.490 --> 15:34.048
NO, NO.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.226
I, UH, MY GRANDSON TOO.
BOTH LIARS.

15:35.260 --> 15:36.352
BIG FILTHY LIARS.

15:36.400 --> 15:40.063
SO HOW ARE WE GONNA BLINDLY
TRACE A MAN'S JOGGING PATH?

15:40.100 --> 15:41.567
WE'RE GONNA USE
MY INDIAN BLOOD.

15:41.600 --> 15:44.239
YOU CAN'T GET INDIAN BLOOD
BY WORKING IN A CASINO.

15:44.270 --> 15:45.965
MAYBE YOU CAN'T.

15:46.010 --> 15:48.638
DUDE, THIS PLACE
GOES NOWHERE.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.705
IF I WAS GONNA RUN,
I'D GO THAT WAY.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.246
NOW WHERE DO WE GO?

16:02.320 --> 16:04.288
I SENSE HE'D GO THIS WAY.

16:04.330 --> 16:06.582
WOW.
THAT'S AMAZING, SHAWN.

16:10.300 --> 16:13.189
MAN, THIS GUY WAS
IN GOOD SHAPE.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.491
WOULD YOU STOP IT?

16:14.540 --> 16:16.633
HE WAS, LIKE, 100.

16:16.670 --> 16:18.365
MAYBE IF YOU WEREN'T WEARING
PLOWMAN'S BOOTS.

16:18.410 --> 16:20.207
I'M NOT WEARING
PLOWMAN'S BOOTS, SHAWN!

16:29.250 --> 16:32.640
ALL RIGHT, LOOKS LIKE
WE GOT TWO OPTIONS.

16:32.690 --> 16:34.009
I SAY WE GO THIS WAY.

16:34.060 --> 16:35.357
OH!

16:35.390 --> 16:37.153
HOLD UP, LET'S THINK
THIS THROUGH FOR A MINUTE.

16:48.740 --> 16:50.298
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:53.380 --> 16:54.404
I'D GO UPHILL FIRST,

16:54.440 --> 16:56.476
SAVE THE DOWNHILL PART
FOR THE HOME STRETCH.

16:56.510 --> 16:58.398
PLUS THIS SIDE GETS BETTER
SHADE IN THE AFTERNOON.

16:58.450 --> 17:00.771
I'M ALSO SENSING
SOME WATER BUFFALO NEARBY.

17:00.820 --> 17:03.118
WHAT IS THAT?
YOUR INDIAN BLOOD?

17:03.150 --> 17:04.185
THEY WERE HERE FIRST, GUS.

17:04.220 --> 17:05.346
DON'T EVER FORGET THAT.

17:05.390 --> 17:07.358
ALWAYS HATIN'
ON THE INDIANS.

17:07.390 --> 17:10.018
IT'S NOT THE INDIANS, SHAWN.
I'M HATIN' ON YOU.

17:18.700 --> 17:22.636
DUDE, THAT ROCK IS SPRAYED
WITH ARTERIAL RED.

17:23.810 --> 17:24.765
MAYBE IT'S ROADKILL.

17:24.810 --> 17:26.607
TASTE IT.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.301
WHAT IS THAT ABOUT?

17:28.340 --> 17:29.432
WHAT?

17:29.480 --> 17:31.300
MY WHOLE LIFE YOU'VE BEEN TRYING
TO GET ME TASTE BLOOD.

17:31.350 --> 17:33.773
EVERY TIME I CUT MYSELF
OR SCRAPE MYSELF,

17:36.250 --> 17:37.285
"IT'LL MAKE
YOU FEEL BETTER."

17:37.320 --> 17:39.185
IT DOES.
LICK IT.

17:39.220 --> 17:40.551
IT'S NOT MY BLOOD.

17:40.590 --> 17:41.784
IT'S ON A ROCK.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.355
DUDE.

17:49.400 --> 17:50.219
PEDOMETER.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.089
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT
A MARATHON RUNNER

17:51.130 --> 17:53.439
WOULD BE CARRYING AROUND
WITH HIM.

17:53.470 --> 17:55.461
HOW FAR WOULD YOU SAY WE ARE
FROM THE COMMUNITY?

17:55.500 --> 17:59.459
I WOULD SAY ABOUT SIX MILES.

17:59.510 --> 18:00.408
I GUESS WE FOUND

18:00.440 --> 18:01.475
THE PLACE WHERE HE FELL.

18:01.510 --> 18:02.807
YEAH, WE DID.

18:02.840 --> 18:03.841
NOW WE GOT A BIGGER PROBLEM.

18:03.880 --> 18:06.178
IF HE'S NOT AT THE COMMUNITY,

18:06.210 --> 18:09.213
AND HE'S NOT HERE,
WHERE THE HELL IS HIS BODY?

18:22.600 --> 18:23.624
THIS IS THE CLOSEST HOSPITAL

18:23.670 --> 18:24.728
TO THE DROP ZONE.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.362
IF SOMEONE CAME
ACROSS OSWALD'S BODY,

18:26.400 --> 18:27.731
THIS IS WHERE HE WOULD BE.

18:27.770 --> 18:29.635
HI THERE.

18:29.670 --> 18:32.309
WE'RE LOOKING FOR MY FATHER,
OSWALD CHESTER.

18:32.340 --> 18:35.901
I'M SORRY, WE DON'T HAVE
ANYONE HERE BY THAT NAME.

18:35.940 --> 18:37.601
HMM.

18:40.450 --> 18:42.247
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:42.280 --> 18:44.612
HE LEFT HIS I.D.
AT HOME.

18:44.650 --> 18:47.551
CAN YOU CHECK
FOR A JOHN DOE, PLEASE?

18:47.590 --> 18:49.353
ACTUALLY, CAN YOU CHECK
ALL THE DOE'S?

18:49.390 --> 18:51.585
TAE-KWON, COOKIE, PLAY,

18:51.630 --> 18:52.824
DO-SI?

18:52.860 --> 18:55.727
I'M SORRY.
VISITING HOURS JUST ENDED.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.192
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GO--

19:00.240 --> 19:02.492
SHAWN--
INCOGNITO.

19:12.610 --> 19:14.441
CANDY STRIPER?
REALLY?

19:14.480 --> 19:16.368
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY MADE
THOSE UNIFORMS FOR MEN.

19:16.420 --> 19:18.547
THEY JUST STARTED.
THERE WAS A LAWSUIT.

19:18.590 --> 19:20.148
I'M JUST SAYING,
AIM HIGHER.

19:22.790 --> 19:24.257
(Lassiter)
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND

19:24.290 --> 19:25.587
WHAT A HUGE BREAK
YOU'RE GETTING HERE.

19:25.630 --> 19:27.598
(JJ)
THIS BACK SEAT
SMELLS LIKE FOOT.

19:27.630 --> 19:29.791
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,
DID SOMETHING DIE BACK HERE?

19:29.830 --> 19:31.195
THAT'S THE SMELL
OF YOUR FUTURE

19:31.230 --> 19:33.562
UNLESS YOU STRAIGHTEN UP
AND FLY RIGHT.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.431
WHAT'S YOUR STORY, BABY?

19:35.470 --> 19:36.698
EXCUSE ME?

19:36.740 --> 19:37.661
IT'S DETECTIVE O'HARA, PUNK.

19:37.710 --> 19:38.859
AND THAT'S STRIKE ONE.

19:38.910 --> 19:40.878
IS HE ALWAYS LIKE THIS?

19:40.910 --> 19:41.979
CALL ME BABY AGAIN,

19:42.010 --> 19:43.500
YOU'RE GONNA GET
ON MY BAD SIDE TOO.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.871
WHOA, WHAT BAD SIDE?

19:45.910 --> 19:47.775
ALL GOOD FROM WHERE I'M SITTING.

19:47.820 --> 19:48.809
HEY, UNLESS YOU WANNA PEE
IN FRONT

19:48.850 --> 19:49.976
OF SEVEN OTHER GUYS
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE,

19:50.020 --> 19:51.544
YOU WILL RESPECT THE BADGE.

19:51.590 --> 19:52.989
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHY YOU'RE ACTING OUT?

19:53.020 --> 19:54.681
I'M NOT ACTING OUT!
HE STARTED IT!

19:54.720 --> 19:57.382
I WAS TALKING TO THE KID.

19:57.430 --> 20:00.729
DID ANYONE TELL YOU THAT YOUR
HAIR SMELLS LIKE STRAWBERRIES?

20:00.760 --> 20:02.728
IT'S PEACHES.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.899
I HAVE TO BUY PEACHES

20:04.930 --> 20:05.897
ON THE WAY HOME.

20:05.930 --> 20:07.466
I JUST REMEMBERED.

20:07.500 --> 20:08.592
SO, UH, JULIET--

20:08.640 --> 20:09.891
IT'S DETECTIVE O'HARA!

20:09.940 --> 20:11.009
STRIKE TWO.

20:11.040 --> 20:13.406
YOU GOTTA LIGHTEN UP, MAN.

20:13.440 --> 20:14.771
YOU GET TO HANG OUT
WITH THIS AMAZINGLY HOT WOMAN

20:14.810 --> 20:16.607
ALL DAY LONG.

20:16.640 --> 20:17.971
DETECTIVE O'HARA'S
AN OFFICER OF THE LAW.

20:18.010 --> 20:19.648
SHE IS
A COMPETENT INVESTIGATOR,

20:19.680 --> 20:20.669
EFFICIENT
WITH HER PAPERWORK,

20:20.720 --> 20:22.347
AND MAINTAINS
HER WORK SPACE

20:22.380 --> 20:23.176
IN A CLEAN AND ORDERLY FASHION.

20:23.220 --> 20:26.849
BUT SHE IS ABOVE ALL THINGS,
NOT HOT!

20:32.990 --> 20:35.527
[woman over loudspeaker]
WHEELCHAIR TO ADMI‘I‘I'ING.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.699
WHEELCHAIR TO ADMITTING.

20:42.070 --> 20:43.765
(Shawn)
THAT'S OSWALD!

20:44.870 --> 20:46.428
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED.

20:46.470 --> 20:47.869
MEDICAL STUDENTS?
RESIDENTS.

20:47.910 --> 20:49.605
IT'S ALL THE SAME TO ME.

20:49.640 --> 20:50.709
HELLO.

20:50.750 --> 20:54.277
I AM DR. HAUSER.
I AM FILLING IN TODAY.

20:54.320 --> 20:56.743
THIS IS MY PERSONAL
CANDY STRIPER KNIK-KNAC.

20:56.780 --> 20:57.986
HELLO.
HE'S FROM GUAM.

20:58.020 --> 20:59.942
WE WILL BE INSTRUCTING YOU.

20:59.990 --> 21:01.719
LET'S BEGIN.
YOU, IMPRESS ME.

21:01.760 --> 21:05.787
THIS PATIENT
IS THREE DAYS POST-OP.

21:05.830 --> 21:06.956
HE HAS AN OPEN WOUND,

21:06.990 --> 21:08.924
WHICH IS HEALING NICELY.

21:08.960 --> 21:11.599
[gagging]

21:11.630 --> 21:13.791
KNIC-KNAC,
GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF.

21:13.840 --> 21:17.560
OR I'LL PUT YOU ON
THE FIRST RAFT BACK TO TALOFOFO.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.669
OH!

21:19.710 --> 21:22.372
GOD, THAT LOOKS
LIKE ROADKILL.

21:22.410 --> 21:25.743
YEAH, IS WHAT HIS FAMILY
PROBABLY THOUGHT

21:25.780 --> 21:26.804
WHEN THEY CAME HERE
TO VISIT.

21:26.850 --> 21:28.818
BECAUSE THEY LOVE HIM.

21:28.850 --> 21:29.817
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WAS--

21:29.850 --> 21:32.580
I WAS THINKING OF SOMETHING MORE
IN AN OLDER GUY.

21:32.620 --> 21:33.757
MM-HMM.
ATHLETIC BUILD.

21:33.790 --> 21:35.781
PERHAPS IN A COMA
OR A COMA-LIKE STATE.

21:35.820 --> 21:37.856
THE PATIENT BEHIND YOU'S
IN A COMA.

21:37.890 --> 21:39.653
NO SH--

21:41.800 --> 21:42.824
PERFECT.

21:42.860 --> 21:44.521
LET'S BEGIN THERE.

21:44.570 --> 21:46.390
JOHN DOE.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.796
ADMITTED TWO DAYS AGO
WITH SEVERE HYPOTENSION

21:48.840 --> 21:50.705
CAUSING LOW BRAIN PERFUSION.

21:50.740 --> 21:52.367
ALSO SUFFERED
INTRACRANIAL BLEED

21:52.410 --> 21:54.298
FROM SYNCOPE
AND FALLING DOWN.

21:59.410 --> 22:00.411
WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG
WITH YOU?

22:00.450 --> 22:02.543
WHERE DO YOU GET OFF USING ALL
THOSE LONG,

22:02.580 --> 22:04.389
COMPLICATED WORDS
IN FRONT OF THE PATIENT?

22:04.420 --> 22:05.819
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL

22:05.850 --> 22:08.512
WHERE ONE GOES
TO BECOME A DOCTOR--

22:08.560 --> 22:09.515
MED SCHOOL.

22:09.560 --> 22:12.028
YES, THERE WAS SOMETHING CALLED
BEDSIDE MANNER.

22:12.060 --> 22:13.550
DO THEY NOT TEACH
THAT ANYMORE?

22:13.600 --> 22:15.522
UH, SIR,
THIS PATIENT'S UNCONSCIOUS.

22:15.560 --> 22:16.822
HE CAN'T HEAR ME.

22:16.860 --> 22:18.725
YOU'RE WRONG.
YOU'RE DEAD WRONG.

22:18.770 --> 22:19.828
HE CAN HEAR YOU.

22:19.870 --> 22:22.691
SURE, HIS BODY IS SLEEPING,

22:22.740 --> 22:24.731
BUT INSIDE HE IS DANCING.

22:24.770 --> 22:25.759
HE IS FEELING IT.

22:25.810 --> 22:27.004
HE'S DOING HIS THING.

22:27.040 --> 22:28.405
AND HE HEARS YOU SAY

22:28.440 --> 22:29.634
ALL THOSE SCARY WORDS,
AND HE RETREATS

22:29.680 --> 22:30.999
RIGHT BACK
INTO HIS MIND.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.904
NOW, DO YOU WANNA HELP
THIS PATIENT OR NOT?

22:32.950 --> 22:34.372
OF COURSE, SIR.

22:34.420 --> 22:37.639
THEN SPEAK TO ME
LIKE I'M TEN YEARS OLD.

22:37.690 --> 22:40.750
UH, HE HAD A SUDDEN DROP
IN BLOOD PRESSURE,

22:40.790 --> 22:41.984
WHICH DEPRIVED
HIS BRAIN OF BLOOD.

22:42.020 --> 22:45.786
HE ALSO SUFFERED A CONTUSION
AND SMALL CEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE.

22:45.830 --> 22:48.754
TALK TO ME LIKE I'M FIVE.

22:52.100 --> 22:56.537
HIS BLOOD PRESSURE WENT BOOM?

22:56.570 --> 22:57.901
AND HIS BRAIN GOT AN OWIE.

22:57.940 --> 22:58.861
I SEE.

22:58.910 --> 23:01.105
AND WHY DO
WE SUSPECT FOUL PLAY?

23:01.140 --> 23:02.971
WE DON'T SUSPECT FOUL PLAY.

23:03.010 --> 23:03.977
OH, REALLY?

23:04.010 --> 23:04.806
YOU DON'T FIND ANYTHING

23:04.850 --> 23:06.670
AT ALL STRANGE
ABOUT HIS CONDITION?

23:06.710 --> 23:08.519
WELL, HIS B.P.
DIDN'T COME UP IMMEDIATELY

23:08.550 --> 23:09.517
WHEN WE ADMINISTERED FLUIDS.

23:09.550 --> 23:11.848
AND WHAT DOES THAT TELL US?

23:11.890 --> 23:13.858
HE PROBABLY TOOK TOO MUCH

23:13.890 --> 23:15.448
OF HIS BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATION
BY ACCIDENT.

23:15.490 --> 23:17.629
SOMETIMES THE ELDERLY HAVE
TO TAKE A LOT OF PILLS

23:17.660 --> 23:19.457
AT DIFFERENT DOSAGES,
OR THEY TAKE IT,

23:19.490 --> 23:20.650
FORGET, AND TAKE IT AGAIN.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.656
BUT THERE'S NOTHING CRIMINAL
ABOUT THAT.

23:22.700 --> 23:26.966
NO.
NO, THERE'S NOT.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.889
WELL DONE.
BOTH OF YOU.

23:29.940 --> 23:31.032
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT I'M DRAINED.

23:31.070 --> 23:32.207
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE TAKE A FIVER?

23:32.240 --> 23:34.470
GRAB A COKE.
MAYBE PLAY SOME FROGGER.

23:34.510 --> 23:35.704
DOCTOR, WE STILL HAVE A LOT
OF PATIENTS TO SEE.

23:35.740 --> 23:39.471
FIVE MINUTES ISN'T GONNA KILL
THEM, IS IT?

23:39.510 --> 23:42.070
IS IT?

23:42.120 --> 23:43.542
WE DID IT, GUS.
YEP.

23:43.590 --> 23:46.616
WE BEAT MY DAD.
PROVED OUR POINT.

23:46.650 --> 23:47.617
NOW LET'S RUB IT IN
A LITTLE.

23:47.660 --> 23:48.888
MAYBE MAKE FUN
OF HIS TOES.

23:48.920 --> 23:50.080
GIVE JERVIS
THE GOOD NEWS.

23:50.120 --> 23:51.451
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

23:51.490 --> 23:53.219
I HEAR THAT.
I'M STARVED.

23:53.260 --> 23:56.149
[all cheering]

24:01.270 --> 24:02.589
YEAH! WHOO!

24:02.640 --> 24:04.062
THAT'S FOUR IN A ROW,
TALMADGE.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.567
YOU'RE ON FIRE!

24:06.610 --> 24:08.475
YOU JUST BROKE
THE PINES RECORD.
FOR WHAT?

24:08.510 --> 24:10.899
NUMBER OF TIMES JUMPING IN
WITHOUT BREAKING A HIP?

24:10.950 --> 24:12.941
YEAH, THAT'S FUNNY, KID.

24:12.980 --> 24:14.208
HEY, TALMY,
WHO IS THIS?

24:14.250 --> 24:16.115
OH, THIS IS MY S--

24:16.150 --> 24:17.981
GRANDSON SHAWN
AND HIS...

24:18.020 --> 24:19.487
GUS.

24:19.520 --> 24:20.782
HEY, GUYS,
MEET BUDDY MARKOWITZ.

24:20.820 --> 24:22.913
HE USED TO BE A STAND-UP
IN THE CATSKILLS.

24:22.960 --> 24:25.053
AND RODRIGO LOPEZ,
ONE-TIME NUMBER FIVE,

24:25.090 --> 24:26.785
CLEARLY NO LONGER,

24:26.830 --> 24:27.728
LIGHTWEIGHT CHAMPION
OF THE WORLD.

24:27.760 --> 24:30.968
AH, AND THAT'S MY ASIAN FRIEND
HOO FLUNG POO.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.594
[laughter]

24:33.640 --> 24:35.198
I DON'T GET IT.

24:35.240 --> 24:36.491
THAT GUY WASN'T EVEN ASIAN.

24:36.540 --> 24:38.508
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
MAKES IT FUNNY.

24:38.540 --> 24:41.976
[laughter]

24:42.010 --> 24:44.706
YOU MIND IF WE STEAL G-POP HERE
FOR A SECOND?

24:44.750 --> 24:46.706
JUST AS LONG AS HE'S BACK
IN TIME

24:46.750 --> 24:47.910
FOR THE CANNONBALL COMPETITION!

24:47.950 --> 24:49.269
OH, YEAH!

24:49.320 --> 24:52.915
[continues laughing]

24:52.950 --> 24:54.019
OH, THANK YOU.

24:54.060 --> 24:55.880
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

24:55.920 --> 24:56.716
WELL, YOU DIDN'T PACK ME
ANY TRUNKS, SHAWN.

24:56.760 --> 24:58.887
THIS IS THE ONLY THING
I COULD BORROW.

24:58.930 --> 25:01.057
(Shawn)
YEAH, WELL, WHILE YOU'VE BEEN
HERE PLAYING AT CAMP COCOON,

25:01.100 --> 25:03.193
WE'VE BEEN BUSY
SOLVING THE CASE.

25:03.230 --> 25:05.027
WE FOUND OSWALD.
HE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL.

25:05.070 --> 25:05.764
TIME TO GET
YOU OUTTA HERE.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.734
OH, WHOA, WHOA.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

25:07.770 --> 25:08.794
WE CAN'T LEAVE YET.

25:08.840 --> 25:09.989
WHY NOT?

25:10.040 --> 25:11.166
THIS CASE ISN'T OVER.

25:11.210 --> 25:12.939
LOOK, THIS PLACE IS A HOT BED
OF SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY.

25:12.970 --> 25:14.232
HEY THERE.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.032
HERE'S YOUR SANDWICH,
TALMADGE.

25:16.080 --> 25:18.776
WELL, THANK YOU, MEREDITH.
THANK YOU--TH--

25:18.810 --> 25:21.779
OOH, WHERE'S THAT
BARBECUE SAUCE?

25:21.820 --> 25:24.914
YOU KNOW PAMELA REALLY
DOESN'T LIKE COMPLAINERS HERE.

25:24.950 --> 25:25.939
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE LUCKY.

25:25.990 --> 25:27.651
YOU SHOULD SEE THE FOOD
THEY GIVE MY MOTHER OVER

25:27.690 --> 25:28.952
AT THAT HORRIBLE
SUNSHINE MEADOWS PLACE.

25:28.990 --> 25:31.129
IT IS ONE STEP
ABOVE CAT FOOD.

25:31.160 --> 25:33.856
GEE, MER, I'D FEEL
A WHOLE LOT LUCKIER

25:33.900 --> 25:36.949
IF THE SWEETEST WOMAN
IN THE WORLD WOULD SCORE ME

25:37.000 --> 25:40.766
JUST A LITTLE TEENSY, EENSY,
WEENSY BIT OF STEAK SAUCE.

25:40.800 --> 25:41.767
COME ON.

25:41.800 --> 25:42.960
YOUR GRANDFATHER
IS A FLIRT.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.604
YOU ARE--
[grggIeSI
AH!

25:46.070 --> 25:48.072
THAT IS DISGUSTING.

25:48.110 --> 25:49.907
YOU LIKE IT HERE.

25:49.940 --> 25:51.202
YOU--YOU DO.
THAT-THAT'S--

25:51.250 --> 25:53.616
THAT'S WHY YOU WANNA
KEEP INVESTIGATING.

25:53.650 --> 25:55.049
BECAUSE YOU LIKE
THE SANDWICHES

25:55.080 --> 25:56.115
AND THE ADULATION.

25:56.150 --> 25:57.139
SHAWN, I'M TELLING YOU.

25:57.180 --> 25:59.080
SOMETHING ELSE IS GOING ON HERE.

25:59.120 --> 26:00.348
DAD, WE FOUND OSWALD.

26:00.390 --> 26:03.052
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO SOLVE.
ADMIT IT.

26:03.090 --> 26:04.751
WE BEAT YOU

26:04.790 --> 26:07.122
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SWEETNESS.

26:07.160 --> 26:08.957
ALL RIGHT, CLEAR A PATH, FOLKS.
COMING THROUGH.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.968
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

26:11.000 --> 26:11.989
(Henry)
YOU HAVE THE SWEETNESS, HUH?

26:12.030 --> 26:15.830
WHAT ABOUT THAT GUY, SHAWN?

26:15.870 --> 26:17.132
[women scream]

26:17.170 --> 26:20.708
WHAT ABOUT THAT ONE?

26:23.680 --> 26:25.102
THEY'RE DROPPING LIKE FLIES.

26:28.150 --> 26:30.618
YOU SAW THE BRACELETS,
DIDN'T YOU?

26:30.650 --> 26:31.912
YES, I SAW THEM.

26:31.950 --> 26:33.087
ALL RIGHT, SO WE GOT THREE GUYS

26:33.120 --> 26:33.984
ALL LIVING
AT THE SAME PLACE.

26:34.020 --> 26:35.681
THEY ALL GET SICK,
AND FOR SOME REASON

26:35.720 --> 26:37.187
THEY'RE ALL WEARING
THE SAME BRACELETS.

26:37.220 --> 26:38.687
NOW, WHAT WERE
YOU SAYING AGAIN,

26:38.730 --> 26:41.119
SHAWN,
ABOUT SOLVING THIS CASE?

26:47.940 --> 26:52.229
SOMEONE IS TRYING TO OFF
OLD TIMERS AT GLORIOUS PINES.

26:52.270 --> 26:54.670
THREE PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN
SUDDENLY SICK THERE.

26:54.710 --> 26:56.132
IT COULD BE
AN ANGEL OF DEATH TYPE THING.

26:56.180 --> 26:59.672
YOU KNOW, THAT IS
A BRILLIANT THEORY.

26:59.710 --> 27:00.711
BUT WHAT YOU'VE FAILED TO TAKE
INTO ACCOUNT IS THAT

27:00.750 --> 27:01.739
IT'S FIVE DEGREES HOTTER TODAY

27:01.780 --> 27:03.782
THAN THE SAME DAY LAST YEAR.

27:03.820 --> 27:07.187
FROGS CAN'T SWALLOW
WITH THEIR EYES OPEN.

27:07.220 --> 27:08.653
IT'S TRUE.

27:08.690 --> 27:09.782
UH, I'M SORRY,
I THOUGHT WE WERE OFFERING UP

27:09.820 --> 27:11.879
USELESS PIECES
OF INFORMATION.

27:11.930 --> 27:13.727
WHAT LASSITER HERE MEANS

27:13.760 --> 27:15.227
IS THAT IT'S NOT OUT
OF THE ORDINARY

27:15.260 --> 27:16.352
FOR OLDER PEOPLE TO FALL ILL

27:16.400 --> 27:18.925
DURING HEAT WAVES OR COLD SNAPS.

27:18.970 --> 27:21.165
LOOK, WE FOUND OSWALD
WHEN YOU WERE CONVINCED

27:21.200 --> 27:23.088
HE WAS JUST WANDERING AROUND
IN HIS BATHROBE.

27:23.140 --> 27:25.438
THIS IS OUR CLIENT,
JERVIS KENT.

27:25.470 --> 27:28.109
I MEAN, SHOULDN'T
YOU CALL FORENSICS IN?

27:28.140 --> 27:30.176
LOOK AT WILLS.
INTERVIEW BENEFICIARIES.

27:30.210 --> 27:32.349
I LEARNED THAT
AT THE POLICE ACADEMY.

27:32.380 --> 27:34.245
YOU WENT TO THE ACADEMY?

27:34.280 --> 27:36.168
I THOUGHT I RECOGNIZED
THAT NAME.

27:36.220 --> 27:38.017
AREN'T YOU THE GUY WHO SET
HIS BLACK AND WHITE ON FIRE

27:38.050 --> 27:39.813
DURING THE ACADEMY ROAD TEST?

27:39.850 --> 27:41.317
YEAH, YOU SHOT
SOMEONE'S TOE OFF

27:41.360 --> 27:42.759
AT THE POLICE FIRING RANGE.

27:42.790 --> 27:45.054
IT DIDN'T COME
ALL THE WAY OFF.

27:45.090 --> 27:47.251
I SAW HIM YESTERDAY.
HE STILL HAS A LIMP.

27:47.290 --> 27:48.826
SPOOL!

27:50.160 --> 27:52.424
THREADS, THREAD.
I'M SEEING THREAD.

27:52.470 --> 27:54.859
UH, UH, UH.
SPINNING, AND, AND,

27:54.900 --> 27:55.889
BOBBING AND WEAVING.

27:55.940 --> 28:01.970
ARTING, YET CRAFTING.

28:02.010 --> 28:05.798
BRACELETS.
HOMEMADE BRACELETS.

28:05.850 --> 28:07.977
ALL THREE OF THEM HAD
THE SAME BRACELET.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.749
OH, WELL,
IN THAT CASE, O'HARA,

28:09.780 --> 28:12.044
CALL CNN BECAUSE WE'VE GOT
THEIR NEW LEAD STORY.

28:12.090 --> 28:13.819
DO THE DOCTORS WHO'VE BEEN
TREATING ANY OF THESE PATIENTS

28:13.860 --> 28:14.884
SUSPECT FOUL PLAY?

28:14.920 --> 28:16.080
NO, CHIEF.

28:16.120 --> 28:19.055
WELL, DOUBLE-CHECK.

28:21.330 --> 28:22.854
MR. SPENCER, AS ALWAYS
IT'S BEEN AN EXPERIENCE.

28:22.900 --> 28:23.969
YOU KNOW WHERE THE EXIT IS.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.319
I GOTTA FINESSE THAT...

28:25.370 --> 28:26.428
DO YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS

28:26.470 --> 28:28.438
WHEN YOU ACT
LIKE A JACKASS ALL THE TIME?

28:28.470 --> 28:29.835
NO ONE TAKES YOU SERIOUSLY.

28:29.870 --> 28:32.361
IF YOU DO NOT WANNA END UP
LIKE THAT BUFFOON,

28:32.410 --> 28:34.401
YOU BETTER LEARN
TO WALK THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW.

28:34.440 --> 28:36.135
I DON'T LIKE
THAT GUY.

28:36.180 --> 28:37.943
THERE'S HOPE
FOR YOU YET, KID.

28:42.980 --> 28:44.743
(Jervis)
AND WHAT WAS
ALL THAT BRACELET TALK?

28:44.790 --> 28:46.940
(Shawn)
I SENSED A COMMON THREAD.
PUN INTENDED.

28:46.990 --> 28:48.116
YOU MEAN THE FRIENDSHIP
BRACELETS?

28:48.160 --> 28:49.457
THOSE CAME FROM CHELSEA.

28:49.490 --> 28:51.378
SHE MAKES THEM HERSELF
IN CRAFT CLASS.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.955
AND SHE DOESN'T
JUST GIVE 'EM TO ANYBODY.

28:56.930 --> 28:58.989
DUDE, SHE'S TOTALLY DANCING
WITH MY DAD.

28:59.030 --> 29:00.224
(Gus)
WHERE DID THEY LEARN THE TANGO?

29:00.270 --> 29:02.989
GRAB A PARTNER.
MEET ME ON THE DANCE FLOOR.

29:05.910 --> 29:07.878
SO YOU KNEW
MY FRIEND OSWALD, RIGHT?

29:07.910 --> 29:09.377
HE COURTED ME A LITTLE.

29:09.410 --> 29:10.377
[clears throat loudly]

29:10.410 --> 29:11.900
CAN I, UH, GET CUTSIES?

29:11.950 --> 29:12.905
FIND YOUR
OWN PARTNER, SHAWN.

29:12.950 --> 29:14.872
I DON'T MIND,
TALMADGE.

29:14.920 --> 29:15.944
I HAVEN'T HAD THIS MANY MEN
ASK ME TO DANCE

29:15.980 --> 29:18.289
SINCE NIXON WENT TO CHINA.

29:18.320 --> 29:19.787
HELLO.

29:19.820 --> 29:20.957
MY NAME IS SHAWN.

29:20.990 --> 29:21.957
I'M TALMADGE'S GRANDSON.

29:21.990 --> 29:24.254
OOH.
I'M TRYING TO MEET ALL
OF HIS NEW FRIENDS.

29:24.290 --> 29:26.520
DID HE HAPPEN
TO MENTION THAT I'M A PSYCHIC?

29:26.560 --> 29:29.449
PSYCHIC.
REALLY?

29:32.170 --> 29:33.967
I SENSED A DARK CLOUD.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.969
AND THEN, DID YOU HEAR ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO HARLEY?

29:37.000 --> 29:39.366
THE PARAMEDICS
AND ALL OF THAT STUFF?

29:39.410 --> 29:42.538
OF COURSE I HEARD.
HE'S AN EX-BOYFRIEND OF MINE.

29:45.250 --> 29:47.070
YOU DANCE DIVINELY, BURTON.

29:47.110 --> 29:49.249
THANK YOU.

29:49.280 --> 29:50.816
(Henry)
MY TURN, SHAWN.

29:52.320 --> 29:53.981
OH.

29:54.020 --> 29:56.079
SO YOU'RE QUITE THE QUEEN BEE
AROUND HERE, HUH?

29:56.120 --> 29:58.327
YOU HAVE MANY BOYFRIENDS
HERE AT GLORIOUS PINES?

29:58.360 --> 30:00.578
I'VE HAD MY SHARE
OF ROMANTIC TRYSTS.

30:00.630 --> 30:03.997
MEN FALL IN LOVE EASILY WHEN
I START TAKING CARE OF THEM.

30:04.030 --> 30:05.258
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

30:05.300 --> 30:08.394
NOW SPIN ME.

30:08.440 --> 30:11.000
MAAAARVELOUS.

30:11.040 --> 30:13.406
THEY CALL IT THE FLORENCE
NIGHTINGALE EFFECT.

30:13.440 --> 30:15.977
SO YOU'RE A NURSE.

30:16.010 --> 30:19.002
YOU MUST HAVE DONE A LOT OF WORK
HERE WITH DIFFERENT MEDICATIONS.

30:19.050 --> 30:20.870
WELL, NOT ANYMORE.

30:20.920 --> 30:21.773
ALL I DO NOW IS LEAD

30:21.820 --> 30:23.572
THE HEART-SMART HIGH BLOOD
PRESSURE SEMINAR

30:23.620 --> 30:24.939
ONCE A MONTH.

30:24.990 --> 30:27.515
THAT'S WHERE I MET
HARLEY AND OSWALD.

30:32.960 --> 30:35.554
SAVE ME A SEAT
AT BINGO.

30:37.900 --> 30:39.993
SHAWN.
[snoring]

30:40.030 --> 30:42.498
SHAWN, COME BACK HERE!

30:42.540 --> 30:44.599
WE LEARNED THAT ALL THE VICTIMS
HAD HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,

30:44.640 --> 30:46.301
SO THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN
ON THE SAME MEDICATIONS.

30:46.340 --> 30:48.035
I LEARNED
THAT OLD PEOPLE ARE HEAW.

30:48.080 --> 30:50.401
LOOK, MY PRIZED STUDENTS
BELIEVE THAT OZZIE GOT SICK

30:50.440 --> 30:52.408
BECAUSE HE OVERDOSED
ON HIS MEDICATION.

30:52.450 --> 30:53.348
MAYBE THEY ALL DID.

30:53.380 --> 30:55.041
WHICH MEANS EITHER
THREE DIFFERENT PEOPLE

30:55.080 --> 30:56.342
ALL ACCIDENTALLY TOOK
TOO MANY PILLS--

30:56.380 --> 30:58.086
OR SOMEONE ELSE
SLIPPED IT TO THEM.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.213
(Henry)
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT A MINUTE.

31:00.250 --> 31:02.081
I OVERHEARD A COUPLE
OF THE GUARDS TALKING ABOUT

31:02.120 --> 31:03.929
A BREAK-IN AT THE ON-SITE
PHARMACY HERE LAST WEEK.

31:03.960 --> 31:05.655
REALLY?

31:05.690 --> 31:07.123
YOU WAIT UNTIL JUST NOW
TO TELL US THAT?

31:07.160 --> 31:09.492
THE THIEF GOT AWAY
WITH CODEINE AND OXYCONTIN.

31:09.530 --> 31:12.124
BUT I THINK THEY ALSO GOT AWAY
WITH BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATION.

31:12.170 --> 31:13.967
SO THAT STUFF
WAS JUST A COVER

31:14.000 --> 31:15.092
TO MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE A DRUG-SEEKER.

31:15.140 --> 31:16.334
THE B.P. MEDS WERE
THE REAL TARGET.

31:16.370 --> 31:19.032
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
AT LEAST THAT GIVES US THE HOW.

31:19.070 --> 31:20.002
NOW WE JUST GOTTA FIGURE OUT
THE WHY.

31:20.040 --> 31:21.302
WHICH REMINDS ME, GUS,

31:21.340 --> 31:22.432
WILL YOU PLEASE GET US
THOSE TICKETS FOR THE WHO?

31:22.480 --> 31:23.469
WHERE?

31:26.010 --> 31:27.546
LOOK, WE NEED TO GET A LIST
OF ALL THE PEOPLE

31:27.580 --> 31:28.615
ON BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATION.

31:28.650 --> 31:29.969
THEY'RE ALL TARGETS.

31:30.020 --> 31:31.317
THAT'S SOMETHING PAMELA
WOULD HAVE.

31:36.020 --> 31:37.282
WE GOTTA GET HER OUTTA THERE.

31:37.320 --> 31:39.322
THE REAL TALMADGE'S STUFF
SHOWED UP THIS MORNING.

31:39.360 --> 31:41.453
HE'S GONNA BE HERE TODAY.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.388
I BET SHE'LL COME OUT
IF A RESIDENT HURT THEMSELVES.

31:43.430 --> 31:45.569
TAKE A SPILL
DOWN THE STAIRS.

31:45.600 --> 31:46.419
WHAT?

31:46.470 --> 31:48.131
JUST TAKE A QUICK HEADER
DOWN THE STAIRS.

31:48.170 --> 31:49.137
SHAWN, I'M NOT GONNA
DELIBERATELY HURT MYSELF,

31:49.170 --> 31:51.604
BREAK MY NECK
TO CREATE F‘I |\IIDEISTRACT ION.

31:51.640 --> 31:52.959
WE'LL PUSH YOU.
IT'LL BE AN ACCIDENT.

31:53.010 --> 31:53.760
DOES THAT MAKE IT EASIER?
SHAWN.

31:53.810 --> 31:56.608
WHAT?
YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

31:56.640 --> 31:58.676
OW!
MY TOE!

31:58.710 --> 32:00.109
[Henry yelling]

32:00.150 --> 32:01.117
HEY, I HURT MY TOE HERE.

32:01.150 --> 32:01.946
YOU STUBBED YOUR TOE?

32:01.980 --> 32:03.516
DUDE, YOU HAVE
TO DO BETTER THAN THAT.

32:03.550 --> 32:05.484
I'M YOUR FATHER.
YOU DO NOT CALL ME DUDE.

32:05.520 --> 32:06.487
PULL YOUR WEIGHT!
COME ON.

32:06.520 --> 32:07.680
MY LIVER!
MY LIVER!

32:07.720 --> 32:10.314
OH, MY LIVER!
IT COULD BE FAILING.

32:10.360 --> 32:11.327
AH!

32:11.360 --> 32:12.486
YOU GO FROM ONE
TO TEN LIKE THAT?

32:12.530 --> 32:14.088
HOW ABOUT A HEART ATTACK
OR A STROKE?

32:14.130 --> 32:15.358
UH, UH....

32:15.400 --> 32:17.322
MY LIVER.
OH!

32:17.360 --> 32:21.968
OOH, OOH.
OH.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.003
MY LIVER!
OH, GOD, IT HURTS.

32:25.040 --> 32:27.065
YOUR LIVER IS FINE.
YOU'RE NOT EVEN JAUNDICED.

32:30.140 --> 32:33.007
ABDOMINAL PAIN CAN BE CAUSED
BY A LOT OF THINGS.

32:33.050 --> 32:34.176
YOU'RE NOT EVEN HOLDING
YOUR LIVER.

32:34.220 --> 32:35.244
THAT'S YOUR SPLEEN.

32:35.280 --> 32:37.544
MY SPLEEN?
OH!

32:37.580 --> 32:39.047
OH, IT'S MY SPLEEN!
IT'S ABOUT TO RUPTURE!

32:42.120 --> 32:44.520
(Henry)
OH, IT'S SO PAINFUL!

32:44.560 --> 32:46.653
WE NEED TO FIND A LIST
OF PEOPLE'S MEDICATIONS.

32:46.690 --> 32:48.089
COOL.

32:48.130 --> 32:49.358
OH, I THINK THIS IS IT!

32:49.400 --> 32:51.493

THE WAITING LIST.

32:51.530 --> 32:54.567
DUDE, OSWALD'S

32:57.340 --> 32:59.467
THE OTHER TWIQTVCCTIMS AS WELL.

32:59.510 --> 33:01.205
UH, FEROCIOUS TIGER WHAT?

33:01.240 --> 33:04.744
F.T.C. MEANS FULL TIME CARE.

33:04.780 --> 33:05.576
LOOKS LIKE ALL THE VICTIMS NEED

33:05.610 --> 33:07.168
ADDITIONAL NURSING ASSISTANCE
NOW.

33:07.210 --> 33:08.370
WHAT?
THEY GET KICKED OUT FOR THAT?

33:08.420 --> 33:10.217
THIS PLACE WON'T ACCEPT ANYBODY

33:10.250 --> 33:11.649
THAT NEEDS
CONTINUOUS MEDICAL CARE.

33:11.690 --> 33:13.180
IT WAS ALL
IN THE INFORMATIONAL HANDBOOK.

33:13.220 --> 33:15.154
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

33:15.190 --> 33:18.353
SOMEONE ON THE WAITING LIST
GOT TIRED OF WAITING.

33:18.390 --> 33:21.359
RECOGNIZE ANY OF THOSE NAMES?

33:21.400 --> 33:23.356
WE JUST FOUND OUR BAD GUY!

33:23.400 --> 33:24.367

33:24.400 --> 33:26.095

33:26.130 --> 33:27.097

33:27.130 --> 33:29.098

33:29.140 --> 33:31.165

IS SOMEONE IN THERE?

33:31.210 --> 33:32.108

33:32.140 --> 33:34.028
(Pamela)
WHO'S IN THERE?
LESTER!

33:34.080 --> 33:37.004
LESTER, I NEED THE KEY.

33:39.180 --> 33:40.772
THIS IS DARRYL JABLONSKY.

33:40.810 --> 33:43.119
HE'S CURRENTLY DOING A NICKEL
AT THE STATE PEN.

33:43.150 --> 33:45.038
DARRYL, MEET JJ.

33:45.090 --> 33:47.308
CALL ME
"HELL ON EARTH."

33:47.350 --> 33:49.580
WE ALL THOUGHT JJ WOULD BENEFIT
IN MEETING YOU, HELL.

33:49.620 --> 33:52.157
SEE, YOU TWO HAVE
A LOT IN COMMON.

33:52.190 --> 33:53.782
JJ HERE IS ALSO A TOUGH GUY.

33:53.830 --> 33:55.627
HE'S NOT AFRAID OF THE LAW.

33:55.660 --> 33:57.719
SO WHAT YOU IN FOR?

33:57.760 --> 34:01.662
VAN DALISM.
REPEATED.

34:01.700 --> 34:05.067
VAN DALISM.

34:05.110 --> 34:07.499
SO WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
HIS RAP SHEET BACK

34:07.540 --> 34:09.428
TO CHUCK E. CHEESE, MAN,
BECAUSE THE ONLY THING

34:09.480 --> 34:10.731
YOU'RE GONNA GET IN HERE

34:10.780 --> 34:12.748
IS CURBED
FOR A CHICAGO SMILE AND--

34:20.720 --> 34:24.679
UM, I'M SORRY.
I, H JUST CAN'T DO THIS NOW.

34:24.730 --> 34:27.358
OKAY, I THINK
HE'S GOT THE MESSAGE.

34:27.390 --> 34:28.425
PRISON IS HELL.
LET'S GO.

34:28.460 --> 34:29.597
CAN'T DO WHAT?

34:29.630 --> 34:31.825
I CAN'T LIE, JJ.

34:31.870 --> 34:34.862
IT'S PART OF MY REHABILITATION
ACCORDING TO DR. SHENKMAN.

34:34.900 --> 34:38.301
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE LYING, AND THINGS, YOU
KNOW.

34:38.340 --> 34:40.160
SO TELL ME FOR REAL.

34:40.210 --> 34:41.507
WHAT'S IT LIKE IN PRISON?

34:41.540 --> 34:44.748
FOR REAL?

34:44.780 --> 34:46.304
IT AIN'T BAD.

34:46.350 --> 34:47.647
I HANG OUT WITH MY BEST FRIEND,

34:47.680 --> 34:49.875
"WHITE SLAVERY,"
MOST OF THE DAY.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.241
WE GO WORK OUT.
CHILL IN THE LIBRARY.

34:52.290 --> 34:55.157
OH, WE GOT
THE CORRECTIONS ON CD.

34:55.190 --> 34:56.612
IT'S READ BY ROBERT FORSTER.

34:56.660 --> 34:58.150
IT'S PRETTY GOOD.
IT'S TIGHT, MAN.

34:58.190 --> 35:00.181
I ENJOYED IT.
THEN WE GO BACK AGAIN.

35:00.230 --> 35:01.595
WE WORK OUT.
WE EAT AND SLEEP.

35:01.630 --> 35:04.269
WE CHIT CHAT.
PLAY BALL.

35:04.300 --> 35:06.598
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
WE DO WHAT WE DO, MAN.

35:06.630 --> 35:08.336
IT'S, LIKE,
GOOD LIVING OUT HERE, MAN.

35:08.370 --> 35:10.395
OKAY, BUT THE GUARDS
ARE MERCILESS.

35:10.440 --> 35:11.600
NAH, MAN, THEY'RE PRETTY COOL,
MAN.

35:11.640 --> 35:14.131
ACTUALLY, WE'RE HAVING
A BIRTHDAY PARTY

35:14.180 --> 35:15.329
FOR ONE OF THEM LATER ON TODAY.

35:15.380 --> 35:17.735
HEY, IS TYRONE
BAKING THE CAKE, MAN?

35:17.780 --> 35:18.849
ALL RIGHT.

35:18.880 --> 35:20.347
[chuckles]

35:20.380 --> 35:22.473
I EVEN HAVE A JOB
IN PRISON, MAN.

35:22.520 --> 35:24.340
TELEMARKETER, MAN.

35:24.390 --> 35:26.779
BEST SELLER OF THIS MONTH.

35:26.820 --> 35:28.185
BELIEVE THAT.

35:28.220 --> 35:29.209
BAM.

35:29.260 --> 35:31.387
IT'S ALL RIGHT IN HERE, MAN.

35:31.430 --> 35:32.829
DON'T WORRY ABOUT A THANG.

35:32.860 --> 35:34.418
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A BLAST, MAN.

35:34.460 --> 35:36.394
OKAY,
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY POINTLESS.

35:36.430 --> 35:37.397
LET'S GO.

35:37.430 --> 35:39.193
COME ON!

35:39.230 --> 35:40.492
THANKS FOR NOTHING, DARRYL.

35:40.530 --> 35:43.260
OH, BY THE WAY,
YOU CAN KISS THAT RECOMMENDATION

35:43.300 --> 35:45.165
AT YOUR NEXT PAROLE
BOARD HEARING SAYONARA.

35:45.210 --> 35:47.201
THAT'S COOL.

35:47.240 --> 35:49.379
I HEAR WE'RE GETTING
A FRAPPUCINO MACHINE NEXT MONTH.

35:51.310 --> 35:57.874
SO, WHAT GOES 10, 9, 8, 7, 6?

35:57.920 --> 36:00.343
BO DEREK GETTING OLD!

36:00.390 --> 36:03.314
[Silence]

36:03.360 --> 36:05.624
HEY.

36:05.660 --> 36:07.924
IS THIS THING ON?

36:07.960 --> 36:11.691
THERE IS A MALICIOUS FORCE
AT WORK IN GLORIOUS PINES!

36:11.730 --> 36:14.631
THE RECENT RASH
OF ILLNESSES HERE...

36:14.670 --> 36:16.535
NOT AN ACCIDENT!

36:16.570 --> 36:18.538
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE?

36:18.570 --> 36:21.300
HE'S A PSYCHIC.
MAYBE HE'S HAVING AN EPISODE.

36:21.340 --> 36:22.375
YES, AND I CAN FEEL

36:22.410 --> 36:24.241
THAT THE CULPRIT
IS RIGHT HERE

36:24.280 --> 36:26.202
IN THIS ROOM,
AND IT'S YOU!

36:26.250 --> 36:27.274

36:27.310 --> 36:28.277
WELL, I CAN'T LIE.

36:28.320 --> 36:29.878
I'VE KILLED ON STAGE.

36:29.920 --> 36:31.717
NO, NO, NO.
NOT YOU.

36:31.750 --> 36:32.717

36:32.750 --> 36:34.684

36:34.720 --> 36:37.450
NO, NOT YOU.

36:37.490 --> 36:39.788

MEREDITH CLOVERFIELD!

36:39.830 --> 36:41.320
[all gasp]

36:41.360 --> 36:42.759
WHAT?

36:42.800 --> 36:43.858
A NAME IS COMING TO MY BRAIN.

36:43.900 --> 36:46.266
HELP ME,

36:46.300 --> 36:47.619
HELP ME, HELP ME,

36:47.670 --> 36:50.867

36:50.900 --> 36:52.834
RHONDA CLOVERFIELD.

36:52.870 --> 36:56.636
YOUR DEAR OLD MOTHER
AT SUNSHINE MEADOWS.

36:56.680 --> 37:01.310
SEVENTH ON THE WAITING LIST
TO GET INTO THE PINES.

37:01.350 --> 37:02.772
BUT YOU COULDN'T STAND WATCHING

37:02.820 --> 37:05.516
HER ROT AWAY AT THAT HELL HOLE.

37:05.550 --> 37:08.314
'CAUSE THERE'S NO SUNSHINE,
AND THERE'S NO MEADOWS!

37:08.360 --> 37:10.248
YOU LOVE HER.

37:10.290 --> 37:12.451
SO YOU TRIED TO BUMP HER UP
THAT WAITLIST.

37:12.490 --> 37:15.357
THE FIRST THING YOU DID,
BREAK INTO THE PHARMACY,

37:15.400 --> 37:19.325
SNATCH YOURSELF
SOME BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATION.

37:19.370 --> 37:20.223
AND THEN YOU TARGETED
THE PEOPLE

37:20.270 --> 37:23.262
THAT WERE ALREADY
TAKING THOSE PILLS,

37:23.300 --> 37:24.836
WHOSE FOOD YOU SERVED.

37:24.870 --> 37:28.829
CHELSEA'S BRACELETS PRACTICALLY
MARKED 'EM FOR YOU.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.701
FIRST UP, OSWALD CHESTER.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.002
YOU KNEW HE CARBED UP
BEFORE A RUN.

37:34.050 --> 37:38.919
IT WAS THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY
TO MAKE HIM OVERDOSE.

37:47.090 --> 37:50.321
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.
I COULDN'T HURT A FLY.

37:50.360 --> 37:55.388
OH, BUT YOU COULD.
OH, BUT SHE DID!

37:55.440 --> 37:58.830
ALMOST KILL TWO OTHER MEMBERS
OF THIS COMMUNITY.

38:06.880 --> 38:08.313
[screams]

38:08.350 --> 38:10.011
A COUPLE MORE PEOPLE,
AND YOU AND YOUR MOTHER

38:10.050 --> 38:12.746
WOULD HAVE BEEN REUNITED,
AND IT WOULD HAVE FELT...

38:12.790 --> 38:17.056
SO GOOD.

38:17.090 --> 38:18.751
TALMADGE MCGULAGER.

38:18.790 --> 38:21.395
OUR COVER'S BLOWN.

38:21.430 --> 38:23.955
WRAP IT UP, SHAWN.
QUICK.

38:29.500 --> 38:30.728
CHECK HER POCKETS FOR PILLS!

38:30.770 --> 38:32.465
I THINK SHE'S GOT SOME
ON HER RIGHT NOW!

38:32.510 --> 38:34.478
OH!
HOW DARE YOU?

38:34.510 --> 38:36.432
DO YOU HAVE A PRESCRIPTION
FOR TH ESE?

38:36.480 --> 38:38.368
EVERYONE HERE IN THE ROOM
WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,

38:38.410 --> 38:39.638
YOUR FOOD MAY BE POISONED!

38:39.680 --> 38:42.740
THAT'S RIGHT.
SPIT IT OUT!

38:42.780 --> 38:44.384
GET SOME BAGGIES,
'CAUSE THIS STUFF IS EVIDENCE.

38:44.420 --> 38:48.049
UH, JERVIS, BABY,
SLAP THE CUFFS ON HER.

38:48.090 --> 38:50.411
ALL I'VE GOT IS A RUBBER BAND
AND SOME TWISTY TIES.

38:50.460 --> 38:51.882
IT'S FINE, IT'S GREAT
JUST CALL THE POLICE!

38:51.930 --> 38:54.922

UH-HUH, OH, AND

39:18.750 --> 39:20.684
MISS CLOVERFIELD
MADE A FULL CONFESSION.

39:20.720 --> 39:21.914
I'M SORRY, CHIEF.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.724
THIS DEMON SPAWN
IS BEYOND MY HELP.

39:24.760 --> 39:26.489
I'VE TRIED THREATENING HIM.
I'VE TRIED SCARING HIM.

39:26.530 --> 39:27.451
I EVEN TRIED BRIBERY.

39:27.490 --> 39:31.028
I TOLD YOU KIDS WANT XBOXES,
NOT HOT CHOCOLATE.

39:31.060 --> 39:32.721
DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW
TO GET SWISS MISS OUT OF SILK?

39:32.770 --> 39:33.862
LEMON WEDGES.

39:33.900 --> 39:36.391
ALL THIS KID CARES ABOUT

39:36.440 --> 39:38.465
IS WHAT O'HARA'S WEARING
AND WHERE SHE WORKS OUT.

39:38.510 --> 39:40.705
I'M A LITTLE CURIOUS MYSELF.

39:40.740 --> 39:44.471
CHIEF, SINCE HE HAS SOME SORT
OF STRANGE ATTACHMENT TO ME,

39:44.510 --> 39:46.899
MAYBE I SHOULD TRY TALKING
TO HIM ALONE.

39:46.950 --> 39:48.975
USE MY OFFICE.

39:49.020 --> 39:51.443
HEY, YOU.
LET'S GO.

40:11.940 --> 40:15.876

40:37.200 --> 40:39.896
I'M SORRY FOR ALL THE TROUBLE
I CAUSED EARLIER.

40:39.930 --> 40:41.192

IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

40:41.230 --> 40:45.030
WELL, I'M GLAD I FINALLY
