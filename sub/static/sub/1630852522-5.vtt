Oh, oh, mom, can we go?

00:12.046 --> 00:13.178

Well, our family's irish.
- The critch's were english.

00:22.923 --> 00:25.590
- Well, my mother was irish!

00:25.659 --> 00:27.659
Being irish is like
being jewish.

00:27.661 --> 00:30.662
It's passed down through
the maternal line.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.297

<i> a lovely couple.</i>

00:32.433 --> 00:34.199
Perfect marriage.

00:34.201 --> 00:36.935
A true fairy tale.
- As in, it's not real.

00:37.004 --> 00:38.337
No such thing
as a perfect marriage.

00:38.472 --> 00:39.938
- Oh, really?

00:39.940 --> 00:41.139
<i> Well, I for one sympathize</i>
<i> with her.</i>

Waitin' for your in-laws
to die.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.278

- Hey, quiet, quiet!
What's that sound?

00:48.282 --> 00:50.549
[knocking] is someone
knocking at the door?

00:50.551 --> 00:53.485
- No, can't be!
Nobody ever comes here.

00:53.487 --> 00:54.986
- I'll get it.
- And that's what you won't.

00:55.056 --> 00:56.688
God only knows who that is now.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.290

- Hey, there, mary.

Looking for mike?

01:21.882 --> 01:24.249

- [gasps]

01:28.756 --> 01:30.522
Oh my! What for?

01:30.657 --> 01:32.257
- I did a parking lot promotion
for a florist

01:32.293 --> 01:34.092
And he let me take
the week-olds.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.727
- They're beautiful!

01:35.863 --> 01:36.995

<i> Adult mark: Gross.</i>
<i> Was mom flirting?</i>

01:43.070 --> 01:45.337
- I never see you down
to the strand lounge.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.605
Mike needs to take you
out more.

01:47.641 --> 01:50.008
You're like my chevy blazer,
mary.

01:50.010 --> 01:51.877
She can't be parked too long
or she'll seize up.

01:52.012 --> 01:53.945

02:13.868 --> 02:17.435
- Well, now you are just

02:17.471 --> 02:21.440
Thank you, dick.
- My pleasure!

02:21.575 --> 02:23.775
Everybody needs a bit

I bet that coupon

02:36.356 --> 02:38.123
- Don't you worry.
Dick is the last thing

02:38.192 --> 02:41.059

02:54.909 --> 02:56.274
I've been thinking about it

02:56.343 --> 02:58.944
And you're officially
my best friend.

02:59.079 --> 03:01.547
- Wow, that was fast.

03:01.682 --> 03:05.183
- I'm sorry. I've never had
a best friend before.

03:05.186 --> 03:07.286
- I haven't had one either.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.755
It's official then.

Best friends?

03:11.592 --> 03:14.893
<i> [hands clap lightly,</i>

03:16.597 --> 03:19.831
- Do tell.
It'll go no further.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.833
- If we are best friends,

03:21.835 --> 03:23.301
Then I, I think you should know

03:23.370 --> 03:25.970
My parents might be getting
a divorce.

03:26.006 --> 03:28.573
The social implications
on a catholic schoolyard

03:28.609 --> 03:31.577
Might make me a pariah, so...

03:31.712 --> 03:34.012
- I mean, they do fight a lot.

03:34.014 --> 03:35.280
- They do?

03:35.415 --> 03:38.450
I-I... I thought of it more
as playful repartee.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.851
- She said he was "thick as poo

03:39.920 --> 03:41.653
And half as handy"
the other day,

03:41.788 --> 03:43.388
Except she didn't say "poo,"
she said--

03:43.457 --> 03:47.626
- Okay, okay.
Yes, I see your point.

03:47.628 --> 03:50.328
Tsk. Oh dear. Uh...

03:50.397 --> 03:52.397
I gotta go do something,

03:52.466 --> 03:54.132
But it's a secret.

03:54.268 --> 03:55.801
- Great. I like our secrets!

03:55.803 --> 03:57.469
- No. I mean,
we are best friends,

03:57.538 --> 04:00.472
But this, this one has
to stay private, okay?

04:02.876 --> 04:05.843
Look, it's complicated.
I'm sorry.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.614
<i> Adult mark: I'd only had</i>

04:09.617 --> 04:11.349
<i> And I'd already upset him.</i>

04:11.418 --> 04:13.151
<i> But there were some things</i>

04:13.153 --> 04:15.153
<i> That you couldn't even tell</i>
<i> your best friend.</i>

04:16.590 --> 04:19.024

05:01.134 --> 05:03.434
<i> Woman: [gasps] what?!</i>

05:05.505 --> 05:07.772

05:07.808 --> 05:11.776
I've been finding it hard
to, uh, get by since...

05:12.880 --> 05:15.547
[emotional]
since eugene passed.

05:15.616 --> 05:18.083

- Mm.

05:18.152 --> 05:20.085
- Allow me.
[velcro rips]

05:20.154 --> 05:22.421
But this is the last time,

05:29.229 --> 05:32.263
I've received a letter
from the lt. Governor.

05:32.299 --> 05:34.366
The league has been invited

with caution, ladies.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.154

05:56.289 --> 05:58.523
High fashion and trendy
haircuts are fun,

05:58.525 --> 06:00.525
But we must ask ourselves,

06:00.527 --> 06:02.794
"when it comes to modernizing,

06:02.929 --> 06:05.863
Is the monarchy moving
too fast?"

the shoe department, please.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.218
- Look at you calling ayre's.

06:26.220 --> 06:27.252
You think you're the queen
of England.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.020
- Oh, hi there.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.755
I have this red tag coupon

06:30.824 --> 06:33.691
That was given to me

Oh, that's great.
It's perfectly valid.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.168
Wonderful news.

06:43.237 --> 06:46.138
And can it be used
to buy shoes?

06:46.273 --> 06:48.539
It can. Lovely.

06:48.675 --> 06:51.209
Oh, well, what kind would
I want?

06:51.211 --> 06:54.112
Oh, well, definitely want them
to be high heels.

Cherry red,

Patent leather,

And good for dancing.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.553
Well, thank you so much.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.924
I will be in with my valid

<i> Sister margaret: Now,</i>
<i> can anyone tell me</i>

07:28.749 --> 07:31.649
What the royal family
actually does?

07:32.886 --> 07:34.886
- Members of the royal family
support the queen

07:34.955 --> 07:37.188
In her many state
and national duties.

07:37.191 --> 07:40.658
Every year they carry out
over 2,000 royal engagements.

07:40.727 --> 07:43.228
Now, even the queen can't be
everywhere at once,

07:43.230 --> 07:45.096
So the royals represent her
at events.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.065
Sort of like santa's helpers.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.033
[kids chuckle]

07:50.103 --> 07:52.237
Or not. Whatever.

07:52.306 --> 07:54.672
I'm... I'm not actually sure.

07:55.775 --> 07:57.576
- I can't decide what's dumber;

07:57.578 --> 07:59.177
That you know all
about the queen

07:59.246 --> 08:00.979
Or that you still think
santa claus is real.

08:01.114 --> 08:02.179
[kids titter]

08:02.216 --> 08:03.715
<i> Sister margaret: As catholics,</i>

08:03.784 --> 08:05.584

08:05.586 --> 08:08.920
Is the crown of thorns
our lord wore.

08:08.956 --> 08:11.723
Did you know that the royals
were once catholics? Ha!

08:12.793 --> 08:14.459
But they left the church

08:14.461 --> 08:17.261
Because the queen's great,
great, great, great grandfather

08:17.297 --> 08:19.164
Wanted to bed a whore.

08:19.166 --> 08:22.200
The pope said no because
he was already married.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.936
So, they formed their own
satanic religion

08:24.972 --> 08:27.405
Called the church of England.

08:27.441 --> 08:29.740
<i>Adult mark: While I disagreed</i>

<i> I couldn't actually say</i>
<i> that she was wrong per se.</i>

08:32.679 --> 08:34.946
- The royals made up
a whole religion

08:35.015 --> 08:38.016
Just so they could get
divorced. Imagine!

08:40.621 --> 08:44.155
- Prince charles and lady diana
won't divorce, sister.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.024
They have effortless romance.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.960
- Hmph! Give it time.

08:48.996 --> 08:51.228
Princess margaret
was divorced more times

08:51.265 --> 08:54.132
Than she was married.
That's a fact!

08:54.201 --> 08:56.935
This false idolatry
of the "royal family"

08:56.937 --> 08:59.604
Is a direct sin against god.

Oh, I can't wait to hit
the dance floor in 'em.

09:15.522 --> 09:17.522
Oh, I got them with the coupon

after all.
