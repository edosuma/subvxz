<i>Previously on "Imposters"...</i>

00:01.862 --> 00:03.128
Seattle.

00:03.163 --> 00:05.296
- She's in Seattle.
- Seattle?

00:07.601 --> 00:08.933
He's an assignment, sweetie pie.

00:10.227 --> 00:12.561
<i>Patrick Campbell could be
one of our biggest scores.</i>

00:12.846 --> 00:14.880
The numbers aren't good.
They are amazing.

00:14.915 --> 00:16.148
Not in a million years, Max.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.150
Oh, yes, you most definitely will.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.885
The payoff is huge.

00:19.920 --> 00:20.886
What's the payoff?

00:20.921 --> 00:22.287
We get to live.

00:22.322 --> 00:24.122
<i>If you ever go to the police</i>

00:24.158 --> 00:26.491
<i>or try to find me, everyone in the world</i>

00:26.527 --> 00:28.927
<i>will know what's inside that folder.</i>

00:28.962 --> 00:30.295
I bet whatever's in your folder

00:30.330 --> 00:31.547
is way worse than what's in mine.

00:31.547 --> 00:33.465
I have literally no idea
what you're talking about.

00:33.500 --> 00:34.536
Yeah, me neither.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.169
Ready to go?

00:37.204 --> 00:38.503
We were never going to run.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.173
You need to stop saying "we."

00:41.208 --> 00:42.974
Rules of the game, Sal.

00:43.010 --> 00:44.643
- You broke 'em.
- Maxie.

00:44.678 --> 00:46.111
<i>This is your ex-wife.</i>

00:46.146 --> 00:47.479
<i>Your shape-shifting, money-stealing,</i>

00:47.514 --> 00:49.481
<i>professional con artist ex-wife,</i>

00:49.516 --> 00:51.349
<i>and mine, and his.</i>

00:51.385 --> 00:53.652
Guys, we need a Maddie code.

00:53.687 --> 00:54.753
No alone time.

00:54.788 --> 00:56.755
No contacting her on our own.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.957
No sex.

00:58.992 --> 01:01.960
I'm gonna throw you one
kick-ass birthday party.

01:01.995 --> 01:04.782
I hate birthday parties, always have.

01:04.816 --> 01:05.831
Until you met me.

01:08.067 --> 01:09.229
Ez.

01:11.344 --> 01:13.271
- Hi, Ava.
- What are you...

01:15.098 --> 01:16.608
- Alice.
- How did you...

01:16.643 --> 01:19.311
Hey, Ce.

01:19.346 --> 01:20.846
What the f...?

01:36.096 --> 01:37.529
- Excuse me.
- Whoa, whoa,

01:37.564 --> 01:38.830
what are you doing?

01:38.866 --> 01:41.099
Going to the bathroom. Is that okay?

01:44.838 --> 01:46.838
May I please use the restroom?

01:46.874 --> 01:48.173
You're not really in a position

01:48.208 --> 01:49.690
to take that tone...

01:51.411 --> 01:53.311
- But yes.
- Come right back.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.580
And no funny business.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.991
Jesus Christ.

02:06.026 --> 02:08.326
Okay, we're okay. It's okay.

02:08.362 --> 02:11.162
Oh, my God, she looks so different,

02:11.198 --> 02:12.898
but I can see Alice in there.

02:12.933 --> 02:14.432
I see Cece.

02:14.468 --> 02:17.369
I see something,
but I don't think it's Ava.

02:19.273 --> 02:21.439
Does anybody else feel like puking?

02:50.404 --> 02:53.638
Well, here I am.

02:56.147 --> 02:58.209
Now what?

03:08.368 --> 03:11.034
Fine, I'll start.
You found me, congratulations.

03:11.069 --> 03:12.270
That's right. We did.

03:12.305 --> 03:14.372
Yeah, and we're not leaving
until we get what we came for.

03:14.407 --> 03:16.407
What'd you come for?

03:16.443 --> 03:17.942
Don't you wanna know how we found you?

03:17.978 --> 03:19.611
Why don't you just
tell me what you want?

03:19.646 --> 03:21.346
- You stole our money.
- Yeah, that's right.

03:21.381 --> 03:23.181
You can't just take people's money.

03:23.216 --> 03:24.349
You didn't just steal our money.

03:24.384 --> 03:26.284
You took... our dignity.

03:26.319 --> 03:28.553
Wrong. No one can take that from you

03:28.588 --> 03:31.222
unless you give it to them.

03:31.258 --> 03:32.957
Anything else?

03:32.993 --> 03:34.392
Yeah, you at least owe us some answers.

03:34.427 --> 03:36.027
I don't have any answers.

03:36.062 --> 03:37.562
Well, you haven't heard
the questions yet.

03:37.597 --> 03:38.897
Let me guess.

03:38.932 --> 03:41.466
How could I do this to you? Right?

03:41.501 --> 03:44.269
- Or better yet, "Why me?"
- Yeah, exactly, why us?

03:44.304 --> 03:45.870
Because it's my job.

03:45.906 --> 03:47.405
It's what I do.

03:47.440 --> 03:49.574
And because you let me.

03:51.132 --> 03:52.000
Um...

03:52.312 --> 03:54.579
Okay, we're willing to cut you a deal.

03:54.614 --> 03:56.414
- A deal.
- Mm-hmm.

03:56.449 --> 04:01.786
There's no deal to be made
because there is no money.

04:01.821 --> 04:04.289
Uh, what about everything
you stole from us?

04:04.324 --> 04:05.823
It's gone.

04:05.859 --> 04:07.959
- It's gone?
- Yep.

04:07.994 --> 04:09.294
What, it's just gone?

04:09.329 --> 04:11.763
- That's right.
- Okay, bullshit.

04:11.798 --> 04:13.598
We're entitled to the truth.

04:13.633 --> 04:15.166
- You want the truth?
- Yeah.

04:15.201 --> 04:17.334
And we're not leaving until we get it.

04:20.005 --> 04:21.539
Okay.

04:21.574 --> 04:23.908
Here's your truth.

04:23.944 --> 04:29.013
You are in way,
way over your heads, okay?

04:29.049 --> 04:31.582
If I screw up this job
that I'm doing right now,

04:31.618 --> 04:36.087
if you screw it up for me,
then he is going to kill me.

04:36.122 --> 04:40.959
He's going to kill me in a very slow,
painful way.

04:40.994 --> 04:42.327
Who are you talking about?

04:42.362 --> 04:45.196
What, you think I do
what I do all by myself?

04:47.500 --> 04:50.835
All right, so,
here's what's gonna happen.

04:50.870 --> 04:53.338
I'm going to get up,
and I'm gonna walk out that door,

04:53.373 --> 04:55.640
and then each of you
are going to turn around

04:55.675 --> 04:59.243
and go back to your lives
because if you don't,

04:59.279 --> 05:02.146
then I'm quite literally a dead person.

05:02.182 --> 05:06.451
And then all of you are not far behind.

05:06.486 --> 05:08.818
There's your truth.

05:09.689 --> 05:12.490
What just happened?

05:12.525 --> 05:14.826
- Ava... get out, let me out!
- What are you...

05:14.861 --> 05:16.639
Maddie, wait!

05:17.931 --> 05:20.131
- Oh, God.
- Okay, he'll get her.

05:20.166 --> 05:21.933
He'll bring her.

05:21.968 --> 05:24.235
- Maddie!
- I don't feel so good.

05:24.270 --> 05:25.741
Oh, God.

05:27.807 --> 05:29.440
Thank you.

05:31.277 --> 05:32.610
- Are they ready for us?
- Uh, I think so.

05:32.645 --> 05:34.645
- We just head right over here.
- Okay.

05:37.784 --> 05:41.452
How many weeks in Seattle,
and you've already got an admirer.

05:41.488 --> 05:43.435
Nicely done.

05:45.458 --> 05:46.791
Huh.

05:46.826 --> 05:48.426
What's the matter? Wrong guy?

05:48.461 --> 05:52.096
No, no, if anything, he's too right.

05:52.132 --> 05:53.531
It's me.

05:53.566 --> 05:55.600
Well, either call
that gentleman and tell him

05:55.635 --> 05:57.301
you'd like to thank him in the flesh

05:57.337 --> 05:59.504
or give me his number.

06:07.213 --> 06:09.013
Jesus Christ.

06:09.049 --> 06:11.015
How soon can we get out
of this goddamn bank?

06:11.051 --> 06:13.158
Whoa. Whoa, hold on.

06:13.158 --> 06:14.754
Look, Max.

06:16.322 --> 06:19.057
This morning at the diner...

06:22.328 --> 06:24.996
I just... I can't...
I can't work here anymore, okay?

06:25.031 --> 06:27.865
I thought after Heller was,
you know, gone

06:27.901 --> 06:29.000
that they'd let me go.

06:29.035 --> 06:31.969
I mean, couldn't I just quit?

06:32.005 --> 06:36.207
No, no, no, you gotta keep on
like nothing's changed.

06:36.242 --> 06:38.009
- You want some advice?
- What?

06:38.044 --> 06:39.377
You wanna quit being a secretary?

06:39.412 --> 06:41.212
Make yourself a wife ASAP.

06:41.247 --> 06:44.515
I mean, it looks like
you're on your way, right?

06:44.551 --> 06:45.650
Just doing my job.

06:45.685 --> 06:47.485
Good, that's good to hear.

06:48.588 --> 06:50.088
Toaster pastry?

06:52.392 --> 06:53.691
I don't buy it, guys.

06:53.726 --> 06:55.026
I mean, who would want to kill her?

06:55.061 --> 06:56.794
Besides us?

06:56.830 --> 06:59.063
Maybe it's like she said.
She's accountable to someone.

06:59.099 --> 07:02.300
I mean, what we need to know
is does she have a new mark.

07:02.335 --> 07:04.035
I mean, is she already married?

07:04.070 --> 07:05.937
Was she wearing a ring?

07:05.972 --> 07:08.239
Oh, I didn't even notice.

07:08.274 --> 07:09.841
Oh, me neither.

07:09.876 --> 07:11.709
Shit, guys,
this isn't amateur hour, okay?

07:11.744 --> 07:13.211
We gotta get it together.

07:13.246 --> 07:15.012
By doing what, exactly? She's a liar.

07:15.048 --> 07:16.347
We have zero information.

07:16.382 --> 07:18.549
She just played us and left again.

07:18.585 --> 07:20.051
I mean, how is it possible
she doesn't have

07:20.086 --> 07:21.085
any of our money?

07:21.121 --> 07:22.520
I need that money, all right?

07:22.555 --> 07:23.721
If I don't get that money, I'm screwed.

07:23.756 --> 07:25.389
Okay, okay, you're right.

07:25.425 --> 07:27.091
We don't know what
we're dealing with here.

07:27.127 --> 07:29.594
And we can't know what
to do until we find out,

07:29.629 --> 07:32.763
so let's get to work.

07:39.072 --> 07:41.405
You having a tough day?

07:44.310 --> 07:48.813
Sorry, everything at the bank.
My boss and...

07:48.848 --> 07:50.748
It's just so sudden, so strange.

07:50.783 --> 07:52.216
No, don't apologize.

07:52.252 --> 07:55.786
You don't need to be
any certain way with me.

07:55.822 --> 07:58.089
Just be you.

08:00.026 --> 08:03.060
You are just so sweet. You know that?

08:04.531 --> 08:05.763
Yeah, you got it!

08:05.798 --> 08:06.931
Just want me to wait or just go?

08:06.966 --> 08:08.666
So fake, aw.

08:08.701 --> 08:10.823
Ugh, fake, fake-ity fake, fake.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.236
Yeah, man, that's so fake.

08:12.272 --> 08:13.337
Looks pretty real to me.

08:13.373 --> 08:14.805
I'm not believing it.

08:14.841 --> 08:17.141
Poor schmuck. He's totally doomed,

08:17.177 --> 08:18.609
and he doesn't even know it.

08:18.645 --> 08:19.777
I don't think he's struggled much.

08:19.812 --> 08:21.078
He's gonna be fine.

08:21.114 --> 08:22.747
- Have a heart, dude.
- Heart-schmart.

08:22.782 --> 08:24.415
We want our money back? There you go.

08:24.450 --> 08:26.083
This guy's a juicy target.

08:26.119 --> 08:27.985
Well, gotta hand it to her,
at least she's

08:28.021 --> 08:29.921
gone back to my type.

08:29.956 --> 08:33.424
I mean, he's good-looking,
well-built, charismatic.

08:33.458 --> 08:34.659
Look at that smile.

08:34.693 --> 08:36.994
Well, maybe you should date him.

08:37.030 --> 08:39.496
Uh, hold up, it looks like
we got a bogey at 3:00.

08:39.532 --> 08:43.201
- "Bogey," isn't that golf?
- No, I mean in a "Top Gun" way.

08:44.537 --> 08:46.108
Who do you think this is?

08:48.341 --> 08:49.540
I don't know.

08:49.576 --> 08:52.343
- Sister, maybe?
- Racist.

08:52.378 --> 08:53.811
It was the way they're saying hi!

08:53.846 --> 08:56.347
Guys, shh!

08:56.382 --> 08:57.782
Racist.

08:57.817 --> 09:00.384
Man, she's meeting his family already.

09:00.420 --> 09:03.054
It's not that I don't
like birthday parties.

09:03.089 --> 09:06.157
It's just that I don't like
being the center of attention.

09:06.192 --> 09:08.059
Oh, you think the party is about you?

09:08.094 --> 09:10.361
Oh, no, no, no, no,
he just wants to show off

09:10.396 --> 09:11.696
what a great boyfriend he is.

09:11.731 --> 09:13.297
Hey, hey!

09:13.333 --> 09:15.866
Well, I mean, yeah, but still.

09:15.902 --> 09:17.235
Doughnut, is that a doughnut?

09:17.270 --> 09:18.803
I love those kind of doughnuts, man.

09:18.838 --> 09:20.171
Dude, how do we not have
any snacks, man?

09:20.206 --> 09:21.472
- Dude.
- All good stakeouts

09:21.507 --> 09:23.074
- have snacks.
- We've been here

09:23.109 --> 09:24.508
- like five minutes.
- Oh, target's on the move.

09:24.544 --> 09:25.509
- They're getting up.
- Uh-oh.

09:25.545 --> 09:26.877
- Okay.
- What do we do?

09:26.913 --> 09:28.913
Uh, don't know.

09:28.948 --> 09:30.581
Uh-oh, looks like
they're splitting up, guys.

09:30.617 --> 09:31.916
- What's the plan?
- Okay, three of them,

09:31.951 --> 09:34.106
three of us. I say we split up too.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.119
I call Alice!

10:07.300 --> 10:09.718
_

10:13.170 --> 10:15.257
_

10:28.998 --> 10:30.731
Can I help you find something?

10:30.767 --> 10:32.867
Yeah, you know, I don't...
I don't know a whole lot

10:32.902 --> 10:34.935
about flowers,
but I'm trying to convince

10:34.971 --> 10:37.905
my new sort-of-girlfriend
that I do by buying

10:37.940 --> 10:40.040
a lot of flowers for her birthday.

10:42.376 --> 10:46.549
_

10:50.853 --> 10:52.753
- Hey.
- Oh, my God, how are you?

10:52.789 --> 10:54.588
- Hi. I'm good. And you?
- It's good to see you.

10:54.624 --> 10:56.390
- Yeah, good, I'm just...
- Yeah, what's up?

10:56.425 --> 10:58.626
It's Patrick's girlfriend's birthday.

10:58.661 --> 11:00.225
_

11:00.325 --> 11:02.630
_

11:08.703 --> 11:11.202
_

11:13.376 --> 11:15.276
- I'm on it.
- Thank you.

11:19.048 --> 11:20.915
Are you Patrick?

11:22.351 --> 11:23.350
Yeah.

11:23.386 --> 11:24.785
Man, I thought it was you.

11:24.821 --> 11:26.921
Wow, this is the craziest coincidence.

11:26.956 --> 11:28.856
<i>This is not gonna be
a repeat of the diner.</i>

11:28.891 --> 11:30.925
<i>Remember, she has
more to lose than we do.</i>

11:30.960 --> 11:33.194
<i>We came here for our money,
and we're gonna get our money.</i>

11:33.229 --> 11:34.995
<i>And we're all gonna
abide by the Maddie code?</i>

11:35.031 --> 11:36.664
<i>- Absolutely
- For sure.</i>

11:36.699 --> 11:38.599
<i>- Let's do this.
- So now we're musketeers?</i>

11:38.634 --> 11:40.267
<i>Come on, guys, don't leave me hanging.</i>

11:40.303 --> 11:42.102
<i>- Always forward.
- Never back.</i>

11:42.138 --> 11:43.195
<i>Sweet.</i>

11:44.073 --> 11:45.139
<i>Yo, handsome.</i>

11:45.174 --> 11:46.173
<i>Yes, beautiful?</i>

11:47.312 --> 11:48.108
Do you mind?

11:48.144 --> 11:51.278
Oh, I don't mind at all. Okay.

11:52.748 --> 11:55.349
Hey, wrong direction.

11:55.384 --> 11:56.417
Well, I mean, we have time, don't we?

11:56.452 --> 11:59.086
Mmm.

11:59.829 --> 12:02.089
I suppose so.

12:03.835 --> 12:05.468
Oh, my goodness.

12:05.504 --> 12:07.037
Who's here so early?

12:07.592 --> 12:08.872
Caterers, probably.

12:08.907 --> 12:11.157
Always messing up my plans.

12:12.111 --> 12:13.878
Hold that thought.

12:20.353 --> 12:21.852
- Hey!
- Hello!

12:21.888 --> 12:24.054
- Good to meet you.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

12:24.090 --> 12:26.657
This is my girlfriend.
Happy to meet you too.

12:28.527 --> 12:30.928
Hey, come on down.
I got a little surprise for you.

12:30.963 --> 12:32.494
Patrick.

12:34.867 --> 12:36.667
What did I say?

12:36.702 --> 12:39.036
- We talked about this.
- I know.

12:39.071 --> 12:41.272
I told you, no surprises.

12:41.307 --> 12:43.173
You're gonna really
like this one, though.

12:43.209 --> 12:44.868
Surprise!

12:46.812 --> 12:48.545
Oh, my God!

12:48.581 --> 12:51.215
I cannot believe my baby
sister is turning 30.

12:51.250 --> 12:52.716
What happened?

12:53.541 --> 12:54.885
I don't know.

12:54.921 --> 12:57.054
I mean, I didn't even know
you had a brother,

12:57.089 --> 12:58.956
and then this guy shows
up at the flower stand,

12:58.991 --> 13:01.191
and he's calling out my name.
It was incredible.

13:01.227 --> 13:03.527
That is incredible.

13:03.562 --> 13:06.063
- Wow, how did you, um...
- Well, you told me

13:06.098 --> 13:09.033
all about your new mystery man,
sent me all those cute photos.

13:09.068 --> 13:10.634
So when I saw him,
I had to say something.

13:10.670 --> 13:13.404
I mean, have you ever
fallen for a guy so fast?

13:13.439 --> 13:15.706
- Ezra, you're embarrassing me.
- What?

13:15.741 --> 13:17.408
No, don't stop, though,
'cause I'm loving it.

13:18.489 --> 13:19.310
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

13:19.345 --> 13:21.211
This is my girlfriend, Jules.

13:21.247 --> 13:24.281
Jules, meet my sister, Saffron.
She's 30 today.

13:24.317 --> 13:26.216
- So I hear.
- Wow.

13:26.252 --> 13:28.452
It's so lovely to meet you finally.

13:28.487 --> 13:30.621
Nice to meet you too.

13:30.656 --> 13:32.456
Okay. Stop it.

13:32.491 --> 13:34.491
Wow, so many people
that love you in one room.

13:34.527 --> 13:36.660
This is gonna be a fantastic party.

13:36.696 --> 13:39.730
Yeah, did anyone offer anyone a drink?

13:39.765 --> 13:41.065
I was just headed there.

13:41.100 --> 13:42.599
Come on, follow me, guys.

13:44.303 --> 13:45.970
What can I get you guys?

13:46.005 --> 13:47.404
Birthday girl first.

13:47.440 --> 13:51.008
Oh, birthday girl? Wow, happy birthday.

13:51.043 --> 13:52.776
What's your poison?

13:52.812 --> 13:54.011
Something strong.

13:54.046 --> 13:55.512
- One for me too.
- And me.

13:55.548 --> 13:58.148
All right,
how about a cocktail I invented?

13:58.184 --> 14:01.819
Clean, classy,
disappears without a trace.

14:01.854 --> 14:03.354
Call it the "Alice."

14:04.390 --> 14:07.324
That sounds wonderful.

14:07.360 --> 14:09.664
- Four Alices.
- All right.

14:14.533 --> 14:16.000
Yeah, it's just so pretty.

14:16.035 --> 14:20.304
Come on, Max, answer your phone.

14:20.339 --> 14:21.839
<i>You've reached my cell. Leave a message.</i>

14:21.874 --> 14:24.008
Shit.

14:29.882 --> 14:31.615
Yeah, it's only been two weeks.

14:31.650 --> 14:33.050
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:33.085 --> 14:35.352
That's hilarious
I did not know that, wow.

14:35.388 --> 14:37.621
So you live right here in Seattle?

14:37.656 --> 14:39.023
Well, Bellevue.

14:39.058 --> 14:40.624
Suburbs, you know, they get a bad rap,

14:40.659 --> 14:43.027
but, uh, what can I say?
I like being able to park.

14:43.062 --> 14:44.294
Yeah, I understand that.

14:44.330 --> 14:45.562
Oh, excuse me.

14:45.598 --> 14:47.431
Oh, no problem.

14:51.537 --> 14:53.337
Having fun?

14:53.372 --> 14:54.335
Yeah.

14:55.107 --> 14:57.238
I sure didn't expect all of this.

14:57.943 --> 14:59.309
But you know Patrick.

14:59.345 --> 15:01.378
He loves bringing people together.

15:01.414 --> 15:02.646
Mm-hmm.

15:02.681 --> 15:03.981
You know, Patrick never mentioned

15:04.016 --> 15:05.682
that you had a brother.

15:05.718 --> 15:10.421
Mm, yeah, well, I think family
is the most important thing,

15:10.456 --> 15:12.222
- don't you?
- Oh, I do.

15:12.258 --> 15:14.725
You really get to know
someone when you finally

15:14.760 --> 15:16.927
- meet their family.
- And big brothers are the best.

15:16.962 --> 15:19.229
- Ahh.
- You have any other siblings...

15:19.265 --> 15:21.999
No, no, just the one. Excuse me.

15:22.034 --> 15:24.501
So finally, finally,
I'm like, yes, okay, fine,

15:24.537 --> 15:26.103
you can cut my hair, and she cuts

15:26.138 --> 15:28.939
an enormous bald spot
in the back of my head.

15:28.974 --> 15:30.674
And then I'm like, okay,
I'm gonna do the same thing

15:30.709 --> 15:33.177
to your dolls,
and I was the one that got in trouble

15:33.212 --> 15:35.746
because Saffron, I don't know, man,

15:35.781 --> 15:37.848
she always knew how to
manipulate our mom and dad.

15:37.883 --> 15:41.351
It's like she has this whole
shape-shifting thing going on.

15:43.122 --> 15:45.122
Is my brother being a
pain in the ass again?

15:45.157 --> 15:46.857
No, no, he's a funny guy.

15:46.892 --> 15:48.092
You know, it's nice to hear some things

15:48.127 --> 15:49.693
about your childhood.

15:49.728 --> 15:51.095
She tells me so little,
I was starting to think

15:51.130 --> 15:52.696
she was raised in a cult.

15:52.731 --> 15:54.398
Well, a cult would've been
a lot more interesting

15:54.433 --> 15:55.632
than Pottsville.

15:55.668 --> 15:57.434
Pottsville? Where's that?

15:57.470 --> 15:59.403
Pottsville, Pennsylvania, hometown.

15:59.438 --> 16:01.071
Wait, I... I thought Cincinnati?

16:01.107 --> 16:02.639
It's Cincinnati.

16:02.675 --> 16:04.475
Right, we're originally
from Cincinnati...

16:04.510 --> 16:05.943
- Right.
- But our uncle got sick,

16:05.978 --> 16:07.277
and we moved to Pottsville.

16:07.313 --> 16:08.879
- Uncle Sam.
- And let me tell you,

16:08.914 --> 16:10.647
Pottsville had never seen
anything like Saffron.

16:10.683 --> 16:12.249
Stop.

16:12.284 --> 16:13.984
When's...
when's the last time you visited?

16:14.019 --> 16:15.719
- Ezra.
- No, no, no, it's fine.

16:15.754 --> 16:17.754
You know, things are a bit
tough back there, you know.

16:17.790 --> 16:21.458
Our dad, his, uh... his memory's
going down, you know, and, uh...

16:21.494 --> 16:24.261
But this one, she's still
the apple of his eye, huh?

16:24.296 --> 16:25.996
Anyway, sorry, not tonight.

16:26.031 --> 16:27.831
Patrick, where are...
where are you from?

16:27.867 --> 16:30.267
Uh, Chicago, originally, then...

16:30.302 --> 16:31.335
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

16:31.370 --> 16:32.613
You're welcome.

16:34.507 --> 16:36.140
How come he's getting
all the play with her

16:36.175 --> 16:37.474
and I'm stuck here like a dishrag?

16:37.510 --> 16:38.775
They're not alone.

16:38.811 --> 16:40.944
Technically not a code violation.

16:40.980 --> 16:44.281
- Well, I still don't like it.
- Hey, how was your little chat?

16:44.316 --> 16:46.316
One-on-ones are not cool, remember?

16:46.352 --> 16:48.452
And that wasn't a one-on-one,
and your breath smells

16:48.487 --> 16:49.753
like a Tijuana strip club.

16:49.788 --> 16:51.522
Are you slut shaming me?

16:51.557 --> 16:52.559
No.

16:54.193 --> 16:55.959
Here she comes.

16:55.995 --> 16:58.162
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:58.197 --> 17:01.265
- Can I have another Alice?
- Of course, coming right up.

17:01.300 --> 17:02.833
Thank you.

17:02.868 --> 17:04.334
Come here, my friends.

17:04.369 --> 17:06.103
- Hey, I have a question.
- Mm-hmm?

17:06.137 --> 17:07.671
What the f...
do you think you're doing here?

17:07.705 --> 17:09.173
Not leaving until we get our money.

17:09.208 --> 17:10.707
I already told you. There's no money.

17:10.742 --> 17:12.509
Well, then I guess you better get it.

17:14.046 --> 17:15.512
Well, that dude Patrick
is clearly loaded.

17:15.548 --> 17:17.047
How long till you steal all his money?

17:17.082 --> 17:18.315
You can pay us then.

17:18.349 --> 17:20.284
- Not exactly how it works.
- Oh.

17:20.319 --> 17:21.852
Okay, how about this?

17:21.887 --> 17:23.921
You think you three bozos
can keep your shit together

17:23.955 --> 17:25.722
for about 30 minutes?

17:25.758 --> 17:27.257
We're not having trouble
keeping our shit together.

17:27.292 --> 17:29.526
Precisely, exactly, boom.

17:29.562 --> 17:31.261
Okay, I'm cutting you off.

17:31.297 --> 17:32.796
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- I'm cutting you off.

17:32.831 --> 17:35.032
So what happens in 30 minutes?

17:35.067 --> 17:37.134
Max gets here and tells
you all about your money.

17:37.169 --> 17:38.735
Good, look forward to that.

17:38.771 --> 17:42.039
- One Alice, made with love.
- Thank you.

17:42.074 --> 17:43.473
Stop it.

17:48.314 --> 17:49.880
So who the hell is Max?

17:49.915 --> 17:52.115
No idea.

17:56.589 --> 17:58.155
Oh, yeah.

18:08.167 --> 18:09.633
Hey, birthday girl.

18:09.668 --> 18:11.101
You know, I'm not even sure I know when

18:11.136 --> 18:12.469
your real birthday is.

18:12.504 --> 18:14.238
Max, I've been calling you all day.

18:14.273 --> 18:15.672
How fast can you get here?

18:15.708 --> 18:17.107
Is the party that much fun?

18:17.142 --> 18:18.675
<i>We have a real situation.</i>

18:18.711 --> 18:22.446
It's Ezra Bloomer, Richard Evans,

18:22.481 --> 18:24.514
<i>and Jules Langmore.</i>

18:24.550 --> 18:26.250
Son of a bitch.

18:26.285 --> 18:27.651
- How... how did they...
- I don't know.

18:27.686 --> 18:29.219
I don't know. Just get here.

18:42.558 --> 18:44.809
Legion of Boom. '85 Bears.

18:44.844 --> 18:47.845
- Game-defining D.
- Oh, absolutely game-defining.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.513
Played a little ball
back in high school.

18:49.549 --> 18:51.448
I'm certainly glad I didn't have to face

18:51.484 --> 18:53.083
any of those super smart secondaries.

18:53.119 --> 18:54.318
Right, well, who would?

18:54.353 --> 18:55.586
I played too.

18:55.621 --> 18:57.154
Quarterback.

18:57.190 --> 18:59.304
- Aw, really?
- Hell yeah, man.

19:00.793 --> 19:02.493
Well, here you go.

19:02.528 --> 19:03.861
- Perfect.
- Yeah, cheers, bro.

19:03.896 --> 19:07.531
Game time. Thank you.

19:07.567 --> 19:08.966
New boy crush?

19:09.001 --> 19:10.601
He seems like a good guy.

19:10.636 --> 19:12.603
Oh, "He seems like a good guy."

19:12.638 --> 19:14.004
Blah, bloo, blee, bloops.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.840
Okay, drink some water.

19:16.876 --> 19:18.375
Drink it, okay?

19:18.411 --> 19:20.213
Can I please have everyone's attention?

19:21.714 --> 19:25.349
Old friends, new friends, family.

19:25.384 --> 19:27.618
I wanna thank everyone
for being here tonight

19:27.653 --> 19:30.554
to help me celebrate the life
of this spectacular woman

19:30.590 --> 19:31.822
standing over here.

19:31.858 --> 19:34.491
Come here, babe.

19:34.527 --> 19:37.161
When I first met Saffron,

19:37.196 --> 19:40.164
she disagreed with every word I said.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.968
And I thought, "Now this is
a woman that isn't gonna"

19:44.003 --> 19:45.536
take any of my shit."

19:46.906 --> 19:48.172
I like that.

19:48.207 --> 19:49.173
We do too.

19:51.010 --> 19:53.344
- You know, I have a saying...
- Oh, he has his own saying.

19:53.379 --> 19:56.380
When love is the answer,

19:56.415 --> 19:58.082
doesn't matter what the question is.

19:58.117 --> 20:00.017
It's kind of cool,
but does that qualify as a saying?

20:00.052 --> 20:01.919
- No, it does not.
- Shh.

20:01.954 --> 20:04.054
The last few years have presented me

20:04.090 --> 20:07.658
with some questions, big ones.

20:07.693 --> 20:09.193
And guess what the answer is.

20:09.228 --> 20:10.928
Gee, guys, do you think it's love?

20:10.963 --> 20:12.596
- Shh.
- It's definitely love.

20:12.632 --> 20:16.433
- Love is always the answer.
- Pfft.

20:16.469 --> 20:19.703
Thank you, Saffron, for your kind heart,

20:19.739 --> 20:24.174
your adventurous spirit,
the way you challenge me,

20:24.210 --> 20:26.543
all of it.

20:26.579 --> 20:27.912
To Saffron.

20:28.047 --> 20:29.346
To Saffron.

20:30.783 --> 20:32.416
Can I puke now or later?

20:32.451 --> 20:34.084
Aw, it was a pretty good speech,
though, overall.

20:34.120 --> 20:37.755
Poor sap, he has no idea what's coming.

20:37.790 --> 20:39.957
- Oh, I almost forgot.
- What's that, a poem?

20:39.992 --> 20:44.595
Folks, happy birthday, babe.

20:44.630 --> 20:47.231
When words aren't enough.

20:51.760 --> 20:53.070
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

20:53.105 --> 20:54.104
Oh, wow.

20:57.576 --> 20:59.243
Yeah.

21:12.925 --> 21:14.358
Ooh.

21:25.104 --> 21:26.170
Cheers.

21:28.708 --> 21:29.940
Hey, brother.

21:31.444 --> 21:33.610
Hey, you know, money talks...

21:33.646 --> 21:35.779
Wanna dance?

21:35.815 --> 21:37.481
Where's this Max guy you promised?

21:37.516 --> 21:38.582
He's on his way.

21:38.617 --> 21:40.317
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

21:42.188 --> 21:45.189
Oh, come on,
might be our last chance for...

21:45.224 --> 21:47.291
A brother/sister dance?

21:50.896 --> 21:52.329
All right.

22:01.997 --> 22:02.919
What?

22:04.343 --> 22:06.043
Shit.

22:06.078 --> 22:07.945
- So...
- Mm-hmm.

22:07.980 --> 22:12.316
- Tell me, my brother...
- Sister of mine?

22:12.351 --> 22:15.285
How did you know about Pottsville?

22:15.321 --> 22:17.955
Well, it turns out I'm a
pretty resourceful guy.

22:17.990 --> 22:21.392
Mm, maybe.

22:21.427 --> 22:24.710
Guess I just didn't expect
you to go that far to find me.

22:24.745 --> 22:26.269
Maybe you underestimated me.

22:27.266 --> 22:28.899
Maybe.

22:35.408 --> 22:40.344
- You seem different, Ezra.
- Yeah?

22:40.379 --> 22:44.048
I still see you in there.

22:44.083 --> 22:47.317
You see... Ava?

22:47.353 --> 22:48.986
I see Maddie.

22:52.892 --> 22:56.260
I see you too.

22:56.295 --> 22:58.429
- Really?
- Yep.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.264
Always could,

23:00.299 --> 23:04.701
see you, be with you, so easily.

23:08.874 --> 23:13.177
Ooh-ho-ho, wow. I remember that look.

23:13.212 --> 23:14.578
What look?

23:14.613 --> 23:16.113
The, uh, "this is something special,

23:16.148 --> 23:18.248
you're the only one who gets me" look.

23:18.284 --> 23:21.452
- Mm.
- How do you do that?

23:21.487 --> 23:25.189
You just throw your heart
around like it's nothing.

23:25.224 --> 23:28.592
I don't know.
Maybe it's different this time.

23:28.627 --> 23:30.594
Maybe he's not just a mark.

23:33.666 --> 23:37.634
If that's what you need
to tell yourself, then... great.

23:37.670 --> 23:39.970
- You guys do look alike.
- Mm-hmm.

23:40.005 --> 23:42.272
I mean, coloring and all. It's crazy.

23:42.308 --> 23:44.241
There's some crucial differences.

23:44.276 --> 23:47.778
- There are.
- I hope so.

23:47.813 --> 23:50.447
All right, she's all yours, man.

23:50.483 --> 23:52.316
Enjoy yourself.

23:55.988 --> 23:57.221
Don't start.

23:57.256 --> 23:58.956
Okay, definite code violations.

23:58.991 --> 24:00.724
One-on-one, touching, out of control.

24:00.759 --> 24:03.427
- That wasn't a one-on-one...
- Shh.

24:06.799 --> 24:10.534
- You got anything with Amarula?
- How about Amarula?

24:10.569 --> 24:13.437
I'll take some Amarula.

24:13.472 --> 24:15.572
- Glass of Amarula.
- Mm-hmm.

24:15.608 --> 24:17.107
- Pretty awesome.
- Yeah?

24:17.143 --> 24:19.343
- Yeah.
- What are you drinking?

24:19.378 --> 24:20.978
Ah, stupid soda water now.

24:21.013 --> 24:24.314
I like yours better.
Bartender kind of cut me off.

24:24.350 --> 24:25.633
Had to do it.

24:32.158 --> 24:35.492
Uh-oh, Dad left the liquor cabinet open.

24:35.528 --> 24:37.694
- Ohh.
- Stupid Dad!

24:41.300 --> 24:43.033
Cheers. It's a party.

24:43.068 --> 24:45.969
- Just don't drive home.
- To never going home again.

24:46.005 --> 24:49.173
Oh, I didn't say get that crazy,
but whatever's good.

24:52.745 --> 24:55.345
- I like your perfume.
- I'm not wearing perfume.

24:55.381 --> 24:57.581
Okay, then I just like
the way you smell.

25:03.422 --> 25:05.589
Excuse me, ma'am. More champagne?

25:05.624 --> 25:07.057
What?

25:07.092 --> 25:08.458
I saw you dancing with Ezra out there.

25:08.494 --> 25:09.793
I need a one-on-one too, okay?

25:09.828 --> 25:11.962
One-on-one what?

25:11.997 --> 25:14.464
Meet me upstairs in the
study in five minutes.

25:14.500 --> 25:15.866
- Richard.
- Or I'm gonna go big.

25:15.901 --> 25:17.935
Richard.

25:17.970 --> 25:19.581
Do it.

25:20.806 --> 25:24.241
What? You can't be serious.

25:24.276 --> 25:25.642
I'm serious, okay? I need closure

25:25.678 --> 25:27.411
really, really, really, really badly,

25:27.446 --> 25:30.278
and this is the only way I can do it.

25:31.984 --> 25:34.751
If I do this, do you promise
to get the hell out of Seattle?

25:34.787 --> 25:38.722
- Yes, yes, yes, okay?
- Fine, five minutes.

25:38.757 --> 25:40.424
Okay.

25:40.857 --> 25:41.725
Dumbass.

25:53.288 --> 25:55.555
Hello, Richard.

25:58.893 --> 26:00.092
Alice.

26:14.542 --> 26:16.208
How've you been?

26:16.244 --> 26:18.975
I'm fine, thank you.

26:20.481 --> 26:22.219
Look, we need to talk.

26:23.418 --> 26:26.552
It's not gonna be easy,
but I need you to hear this.

26:26.588 --> 26:29.188
- Should I take a seat?
- Just... let me...

26:29.223 --> 26:31.223
- I was gonna say that.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

26:31.259 --> 26:32.458
Go ahead.

26:34.829 --> 26:37.797
Uh, have a seat.

26:39.100 --> 26:41.601
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

26:49.944 --> 26:52.912
So I'm breaking up with you.

26:52.947 --> 26:54.814
I understand.

26:54.849 --> 26:56.716
Can you maybe be a little bit upset?

26:56.751 --> 26:58.050
I just dumped you.

26:58.086 --> 27:01.821
Oh, right, I'm sorry.

27:01.856 --> 27:03.016
Do it again.

27:05.994 --> 27:09.428
Alice...

27:09.464 --> 27:11.230
I'm breaking up with you.

27:11.265 --> 27:12.898
Richie, don't, please.

27:12.934 --> 27:14.834
- We're so good together.
- I know.

27:14.869 --> 27:17.103
- What about all our plans?
- No, I know.

27:17.138 --> 27:22.575
We were very good together,
but I'm on a journey now that...

27:22.610 --> 27:24.176
I'm on a journey which...

27:24.212 --> 27:29.015
I mean, I'm on a journey which...

27:29.050 --> 27:32.618
I'm journeying, and it's a solo mission,

27:32.654 --> 27:35.688
at least for now,
and you can't come with me.

27:38.226 --> 27:40.960
- Maybe if...
- Just... just don't, please.

27:40.995 --> 27:43.429
Please, seriously.

27:46.534 --> 27:49.268
You know,
sometimes I can't eat or sleep.

27:49.303 --> 27:51.771
You took up so much room inside me,

27:51.806 --> 27:54.206
and then you just ripped it all out

27:54.242 --> 27:57.143
and left this big, painful nothing.

27:59.914 --> 28:03.349
And I don't want it anymore,
and so I'm...

28:03.384 --> 28:07.953
I'm breaking up with you,
and, uh, we're done.

28:07.989 --> 28:10.890
You understand?

28:10.925 --> 28:12.525
We're done.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.186
Go.

28:16.263 --> 28:17.963
Please.

28:29.331 --> 28:31.117
I'm sorry.

28:38.853 --> 28:41.220
Maddie, Alice, wait.

28:46.260 --> 28:49.328
- Alice, Alice, hold on, hold on.
- Shh, shh, shh, Saffron.

28:49.363 --> 28:51.430
- You mean Saffron.
- Okay, whatever, I'm sorry.

28:51.466 --> 28:53.065
Look, are you okay? Are you okay?

28:53.101 --> 28:55.701
You seemed like you...
Should we get back together?

28:55.737 --> 28:58.337
What? No, no, you said

28:58.372 --> 29:00.172
you wanted closure, I gave you closure.

29:00.208 --> 29:01.574
I didn't say closure and tears.

29:01.609 --> 29:03.776
Okay, this... this...

29:07.715 --> 29:10.449
How can you just... How?

29:10.485 --> 29:12.084
It's my job. I told you.

29:12.120 --> 29:14.653
- Well, it's a shit job, okay?
- Ugh.

29:14.689 --> 29:17.089
Boo to your job.

29:18.659 --> 29:20.459
Oh! Hey.

29:20.495 --> 29:23.596
- There you go.
- I like that one.

29:32.840 --> 29:38.444
Yeah, oh, people, people!

29:38.479 --> 29:41.747
Hi, everyone, hi,
are you having a good time?

29:43.651 --> 29:45.951
Me too!

29:45.987 --> 29:49.421
I'm Jules. I'm Saffron's girlfriend.

29:49.457 --> 29:53.659
Oh, no, wait,
I'm Saffron's brother's girlfriend,

29:53.694 --> 29:57.359
and I got a lot of
feelings on this big night,

29:57.394 --> 29:59.381
so listen up!

29:59.416 --> 30:00.909
Shit.

30:02.099 --> 30:05.901
Birthday.

30:05.936 --> 30:07.936
Birthday!

30:07.972 --> 30:10.305
When are we really born?

30:10.341 --> 30:13.075
Is it when we first come
out of the birth canal,

30:13.110 --> 30:16.645
or is it when we first
become aware of ourselves?

30:16.680 --> 30:18.514
Maybe we're born again

30:18.549 --> 30:20.849
over and over and over and over

30:20.885 --> 30:24.419
with each person that we meet.

30:24.455 --> 30:31.059
Our birthday girl, 30 years, or 30 days.

30:32.863 --> 30:38.367
Maybe we should all just face the facts,
that Saffron Keyes

30:38.402 --> 30:40.035
- is really just...
- Saffron Keyes is really

30:40.070 --> 30:42.271
30 years old today. I love you, sis.

30:42.306 --> 30:44.179
Come on, raise a glass, everybody, eh?

30:44.214 --> 30:45.140
Come on.

30:45.176 --> 30:47.176
Cheers. Come on.

30:48.812 --> 30:50.946
Hey, hey, come here,
come here, come on, come on.

30:55.686 --> 30:58.387
Hey, come on, come on.

31:02.393 --> 31:04.159
Will you cut it out, God damn it?

31:04.195 --> 31:05.994
People need to know who she really is.

31:06.030 --> 31:07.729
- Shh!
- No, don't you shush me!

31:07.765 --> 31:10.132
She was my wife too, okay?
I have things to say too.

31:10.167 --> 31:12.868
Okay, okay, come on, come on.

31:12.903 --> 31:14.503
All we had to do is
keep our shit together

31:14.538 --> 31:17.072
for 30 minutes, Jesus!

31:17.107 --> 31:18.989
- No, I'm fine.
- Unbelievable.

31:20.077 --> 31:21.476
What the hell?

31:21.512 --> 31:24.012
You actually did the wig thing?
Are you insane?

31:24.048 --> 31:25.881
We came here to do a job, get the money,

31:25.916 --> 31:27.716
- and run, remember?
- Is that what you were doing

31:27.751 --> 31:29.051
when you were dancing
cheek to cheek with her?

31:29.086 --> 31:30.652
Exactly, no one-on-ones, remember?

31:30.688 --> 31:31.653
She asked me.

31:36.694 --> 31:38.994
- Mr. Ellis.
- Pops?

31:39.029 --> 31:40.329
Señor Cisneros?

31:40.364 --> 31:41.997
My name is Max.

31:44.851 --> 31:46.260
I knew you weren't dead.

31:46.261 --> 31:48.128
- You're a bright kid.
- Wait, so you were working

31:48.163 --> 31:50.619
- with her the whole time?
- Yeah.

31:50.675 --> 31:53.442
So does this mean that you
don't really think my art

31:53.478 --> 31:56.779
"marries the playful
subversivism of Duchamp

31:56.814 --> 32:00.917
with the sublime sensuality of Kahlo"?

32:00.952 --> 32:02.318
How drunk is she?

32:02.353 --> 32:04.220
Not... not enough.

32:04.255 --> 32:08.157
Sit down, everyone. Now.

32:12.797 --> 32:14.230
Do you know why you're here?

32:14.265 --> 32:16.599
We're not here for any trouble, okay?

32:16.634 --> 32:18.768
- We just want our money.
- Wrong.

32:18.803 --> 32:21.504
You came here to chase a phantom.

32:21.539 --> 32:23.306
People do crazy things for love.
I get it.

32:23.341 --> 32:25.975
If they didn't, well,
I wouldn't be in business.

32:26.010 --> 32:28.744
But know this: there's no Ava;

32:28.780 --> 32:30.846
there's no Cece; there's no Alice;

32:30.882 --> 32:34.483
and there's no money, not now, not ever.

32:34.519 --> 32:36.819
Says you.

32:36.854 --> 32:38.287
I'm sorry?

32:38.323 --> 32:40.189
"A," you're a con artist,
so what you say

32:40.224 --> 32:43.526
doesn't exactly hold water.
"B," we can blow the lid

32:43.561 --> 32:45.328
off this whole thing
in five seconds flat...

32:45.363 --> 32:46.662
- Yeah.
- If you don't guarantee us

32:46.698 --> 32:48.531
- a piece of the action.
- True that.

32:48.566 --> 32:50.499
- "A piece of the action."
- Mm-hmm.

32:50.535 --> 32:52.635
At what price, hmm?

32:52.670 --> 32:54.270
Are you willing to destroy your mother

32:54.305 --> 32:56.005
and bring down Bloom Boot & Heel

32:56.040 --> 32:58.674
in one fell swoop when I reveal to Mumsy

32:58.710 --> 33:00.810
that your father has a
sweet little side dish

33:00.845 --> 33:03.279
named Chanterelle and that the entire

33:03.314 --> 33:05.982
family business is built
upon a stolen patent?

33:06.017 --> 33:07.683
Whoa, seriously?

33:07.719 --> 33:10.186
And are you going to be
able to live with yourself

33:10.221 --> 33:12.655
when your hometown finds out
that you threw that interception

33:12.690 --> 33:18.060
on purpose to beat the spread?
And for what, 10 grand?

33:18.096 --> 33:19.128
That's pretty weak.

33:19.163 --> 33:20.363
That money went to my mom.

33:20.398 --> 33:21.664
- Nobody cares, son.
- I knew it.

33:21.699 --> 33:24.000
I knew you guys had your own secrets.

33:24.035 --> 33:25.468
So it seems we're all con artists

33:25.503 --> 33:27.970
in our own way, aren't we?

33:28.006 --> 33:31.657
- And poor Jules...
- Do not go there.

33:33.511 --> 33:36.512
Please don't forget that
we have this information.

33:36.547 --> 33:39.315
Leave town today, or we'll use it.

33:39.350 --> 33:41.817
And my last and most important point:

33:41.853 --> 33:44.654
if anything interferes
with Maddie doing this job,

33:44.689 --> 33:47.757
the people who sent her
here to do this job,

33:47.792 --> 33:49.225
well, simply put,

33:49.260 --> 33:51.560
they will kill her, they will kill me,

33:51.596 --> 33:53.362
and, as far as you three bumblers go...

33:53.398 --> 33:56.332
Hey, man, don't threaten us.
I'm telling you...

33:56.367 --> 33:57.333
- Oh!
- Whoa!

34:00.538 --> 34:02.338
And, oh, yeah, there's that.

34:02.373 --> 34:05.174
Don't let me see any of you ever again.

34:24.795 --> 34:26.529
Josh, what is it?

34:26.563 --> 34:28.597
Why have you been calling
for the last three hours?

34:28.632 --> 34:30.599
<i>Jesus, Ezra, why haven't you
been answering your phone?</i>

34:30.635 --> 34:32.201
<i>Dad had a heart attack.</i>

34:32.235 --> 34:33.436
What?

34:33.471 --> 34:35.271
I-Is he okay?

34:35.306 --> 34:36.605
<i>We don't... We don't know, man.</i>

34:36.641 --> 34:38.139
<i>You just... You need to come home.</i>

34:38.176 --> 34:40.543
<i>Mom is... It's rough here, man.</i>

34:40.578 --> 34:42.509
<i>Just get home now.</i>

34:47.618 --> 34:49.652
What's going on, man?

34:52.023 --> 34:53.589
What?

35:09.307 --> 35:11.440
You have the post-party blues?

35:11.476 --> 35:13.776
Mm, no.

35:13.811 --> 35:18.514
Just, you know, a year older.

35:18.549 --> 35:20.116
I don't think I'm any wiser.

35:20.151 --> 35:24.954
Mm, I think you're a lot
wiser than you know.

35:24.989 --> 35:27.857
Thank you.

35:27.892 --> 35:30.159
Really, thank you

35:30.194 --> 35:32.628
for the party,

35:32.663 --> 35:37.166
the fireworks, everything.

35:37.201 --> 35:38.968
You're amazing.

35:39.003 --> 35:41.137
And I'm not even done yet.

35:41.172 --> 35:42.671
I mean, you didn't think
I was gonna really let

35:42.707 --> 35:43.939
your birthday pass without giving you

35:43.975 --> 35:46.609
an actual gift, did you?

35:46.644 --> 35:48.344
- Patrick.
- Hold on. Give me one second.

35:48.379 --> 35:50.679
- We... ugh.
- One second.

35:50.715 --> 35:54.450
I would like you to open this,

35:54.485 --> 35:55.684
please, madam.

35:55.720 --> 36:00.289
Oh, my God, you have done enough.

36:09.567 --> 36:12.334
Worth way more than anything
I have to put in it.

36:12.370 --> 36:15.070
Oh, then we gotta do
something about that.

36:15.106 --> 36:16.705
And you should probably leave some room

36:16.741 --> 36:19.508
for a little vacation
shopping when you pack.

36:19.544 --> 36:21.010
When I pack?

36:21.045 --> 36:23.345
Yeah, I thought this weekend,
I'd take you

36:23.381 --> 36:25.481
for a little getaway, unless, of course,

36:25.516 --> 36:26.734
you don't wanna go.

36:28.686 --> 36:30.419
Wait, wait, don't you even
wanna know where we're going?

36:30.454 --> 36:33.656
No, no, no, anywhere
that's away with you

36:33.691 --> 36:37.059
is exactly where I wanna be.

36:50.074 --> 36:51.841
How long you gonna go for?

36:51.876 --> 36:54.009
I'll know more when I get there, uh...

36:59.984 --> 37:04.553
Hey, I'm so sorry about your dad.

37:04.589 --> 37:06.689
But you know this isn't over.

37:06.724 --> 37:09.358
Oh, maybe, or maybe
we just have to accept

37:09.393 --> 37:11.694
that we're not getting
what we came here to get.

37:11.729 --> 37:13.696
We don't even know what
we came here to get,

37:13.731 --> 37:17.900
so there's no reason to think
we can't still get it, right?

37:17.935 --> 37:20.269
You know, what's scary
is that I'm starting

37:20.304 --> 37:22.137
to understand your logic.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.274
I think you miss me already.

37:25.309 --> 37:27.209
Yeah, yeah, uh, in your dreams.

37:43.594 --> 37:44.960
Take care of yourself, all right?

37:44.996 --> 37:46.996
- Yeah, okay.
- Talk to you soon.

38:03.547 --> 38:06.615
Let me just say again,
I really, really, really

38:06.651 --> 38:08.617
think it's a stupid idea.

38:08.653 --> 38:10.352
You need the electrolytes. Drink up.

38:10.388 --> 38:13.022
No, just... will you just
listen to me for a second?

38:13.057 --> 38:15.624
Max said that Cece
was in actual trouble,

38:15.660 --> 38:18.193
like violence, death.

38:18.772 --> 38:19.628
He's a con artist.

38:19.664 --> 38:20.663
He was lying.

38:20.698 --> 38:21.931
What if he wasn't?

38:21.966 --> 38:23.432
Look, she chose this life, all right?

38:23.467 --> 38:24.800
Patrick didn't.

38:24.835 --> 38:26.535
- He's a good guy.
- He's fine.

38:26.570 --> 38:28.671
- Whatever, it doesn't...
- Let me ask you something.

38:28.706 --> 38:31.140
What if somebody could've
come to you after you met Cece

38:31.175 --> 38:32.841
but before she totally
screwed up your life

38:32.877 --> 38:36.879
and could've done something,
could've stopped it, huh?

38:39.417 --> 38:41.517
Just, what if someone tries to hurt her?

38:42.264 --> 38:43.252
Or us?

38:43.287 --> 38:45.454
I mean, I really think you
should call Ezra before you...

38:45.489 --> 38:47.022
I don't need Ezra's permission, okay?

38:47.058 --> 38:48.357
I'm going.

38:48.392 --> 38:49.959
You can stay here,
or you can come with me.

38:49.994 --> 38:51.460
- Ugh, you can't leave.
- All right, watch me.

38:51.495 --> 38:53.228
- We're a team or whatever.
- All right?

38:53.264 --> 38:55.364
- Always forward, never back.
- That doesn't even apply

38:55.399 --> 38:56.966
in this case if you... Wait, Richie!

38:58.520 --> 38:59.735
You'll ruin everything.

39:19.751 --> 39:21.751
Oh, shit.

39:56.321 --> 39:58.988
Ah, shit, come on.

40:07.098 --> 40:08.531
Patrick!

40:14.706 --> 40:16.013
God damn it.

40:16.875 --> 40:17.822
Ahh.

40:19.219 --> 40:21.377
Patrick!

40:21.412 --> 40:24.013
Oh, ahh.

40:27.252 --> 40:28.451
No, come on.

40:32.757 --> 40:33.956
Excuse me.

40:33.992 --> 40:35.458
Patrick!

40:38.555 --> 40:39.295
Next.

40:42.267 --> 40:44.066
Okay, just put it in there.

40:44.102 --> 40:46.102
- Thank you.
- You can go through.

40:55.613 --> 40:57.113
Hey.

40:58.683 --> 41:00.049
Thanks.

41:01.653 --> 41:03.019
Can I help you?

41:03.054 --> 41:05.355
Uh, yeah, man, I'm just looking for...

41:08.093 --> 41:09.726
What's up, superstar?

41:09.761 --> 41:11.194
Thank you. Good morning.

41:12.897 --> 41:15.198
That's right, late.

41:15.233 --> 41:16.966
Late.
