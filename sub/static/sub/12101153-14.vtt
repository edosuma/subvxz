WEBVTT

00:01.392 --> 00:03.264
<i>Previously on</i> Supergirl...

00:03.307 --> 00:05.266
I am going to ask the Super
friends if I could be embedded
with them.

00:05.309 --> 00:07.137
Lena, you're back!

00:07.181 --> 00:09.183
Did you find anything else
about your mom?

00:09.226 --> 00:10.619
Kind of a lot to process,

00:10.662 --> 00:12.360
so I'd prefer it if we could
just jump back into work

00:12.403 --> 00:14.231
and maybe you could bring me up
to speed?

00:14.275 --> 00:17.887
We're in a race against a
vengeful Fifth Dimensional Imp
named Nyxly

00:17.930 --> 00:22.370
to find seven Totems before she
can use them to wipe us out of
existence.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.676
- She's angry.
- Kara?

00:24.720 --> 00:27.505
- Nyxly's angry.
- My pain is the price
of the power...

00:27.549 --> 00:33.555
and with it, I will find the
rest of the Totems.

00:40.997 --> 00:43.173
No, not again!

00:43.217 --> 00:46.698
- Well, you are a winger.
- Well, it's called
hand-eye coordination.

00:46.742 --> 00:48.439
I don't know
what else to tell you, babe.

00:48.483 --> 00:50.920
- Don't we have
enough stress in our lives?
- What's stressful?

00:50.963 --> 00:52.704
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:52.748 --> 00:54.097
Whose turn is it?

00:54.141 --> 00:55.577
J'onn's.
- Okay, everyone, so, hopefully,

00:55.620 --> 00:57.796
she'll be home soon,
and then we can...

01:00.103 --> 01:01.670
Hey.
Hey.

01:01.713 --> 01:04.107
- What are you guys doing here?
- It's game night, remember?

01:04.151 --> 01:06.414
We thought that
it would cheer you up.

01:06.457 --> 01:08.068
Oh, that's...

01:08.111 --> 01:09.330
Guys, that's really sweet.

01:09.373 --> 01:12.202
I just figured
with Nyxly still out there,

01:12.246 --> 01:13.377
we would cancel our plans.

01:13.421 --> 01:15.466
We all need to relax
and decompress.

01:15.510 --> 01:16.728
You most of all, Kara.

01:16.772 --> 01:18.382
Yeah, but there's
still no sign of Nyxly

01:18.426 --> 01:20.123
and she already has
one Totem.

01:20.167 --> 01:22.430
Brainy is on the Legion ship
and he's scanning
for Nyxly's ship.

01:22.473 --> 01:25.215
So if she or Mitch
pop up anywhere, we'll know.

01:25.259 --> 01:29.176
Besides, the mental tether
you share with Nyxly
could be a benefit to us.

01:29.219 --> 01:31.569
Yeah, well, I...
I can't read her mind.

01:31.613 --> 01:34.137
I can only sense
her extreme emotions.

01:34.181 --> 01:37.967
And it's not like
a light switch
I can just turn on and off.

01:38.010 --> 01:41.144
I feel like I'm constantly
just waiting for it to happen.

01:41.188 --> 01:42.406
I can't think of anything else.

01:42.450 --> 01:43.668
We have to find her.

01:43.712 --> 01:46.193
Well, I might have something
that can help.

01:46.236 --> 01:48.020
My mother's book of spells.

01:48.064 --> 01:49.631
Have you found anything useful?

01:49.674 --> 01:51.198
Not yet.

01:51.241 --> 01:53.069
I'm trying to figure out
the underlying
scientific logic,

01:53.113 --> 01:56.768
but I'm beginning
to think magic is mainly
just instinct and intuition.

01:56.812 --> 02:00.424
Honestly, that sounds a lot
like dream interpretation.

02:00.468 --> 02:02.818
Maybe I could help you
try to sort some of that out?

02:03.471 --> 02:05.603
I'd really like that.

02:05.647 --> 02:07.953
- Maybe we could start tomorrow.
- Yeah.

02:07.997 --> 02:11.827
Lena, there's...
There's something
we need to tell you.

02:11.870 --> 02:13.481
Um...

02:13.524 --> 02:16.179
William Dey is going
to be embedded at the Tower,

02:16.223 --> 02:18.486
covering all of us for CatCo.

02:18.529 --> 02:21.532
A reporter? At the Tower?

02:21.576 --> 02:23.273
Are you sure
that's such a good idea?

02:23.317 --> 02:25.145
We think that it would be good
for the mission.

02:25.188 --> 02:26.624
We need the public support.

02:26.668 --> 02:28.974
Especially if things continue
to spiral with Nyxly.

02:29.018 --> 02:31.629
But still, he'll have to work
within our parameters.

02:31.673 --> 02:33.544
Which means
keeping your identity

02:33.588 --> 02:35.677
and your connection to us
off the record.

02:36.678 --> 02:39.463
Well...
Good luck tomorrow.

02:39.507 --> 02:41.030
You won't be at the Tower?

02:41.073 --> 02:43.554
I have a home check
with an alien orphan
named Esme.

02:43.598 --> 02:45.426
I met her at Joey's group home.

02:45.469 --> 02:47.384
She was placed with
a foster family last week.

02:47.428 --> 02:52.346
Hopefully, she ends up
with a family
where she can really blossom.

02:55.349 --> 02:57.002
Why are you laughing?

02:58.178 --> 02:59.266
Like that?

02:59.309 --> 03:01.006
It's Nyxly.

03:01.050 --> 03:05.707
I can sense her and she's...
She's really happy.

03:12.104 --> 03:15.238
Another Totem in National City.

03:15.282 --> 03:19.111
It's almost too easy.

03:19.155 --> 03:22.898
It's as if fate
is just dropping them
on my doorstep.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.857
But the moment
we leave the ship to get it,

03:25.901 --> 03:28.599
Supergirl and her friends
are gonna be able to track us.

03:30.427 --> 03:32.473
Well, then
we better move quickly.

03:44.311 --> 03:47.009
And I even have
my own bathroom.

03:47.052 --> 03:48.576
Can you believe?

03:48.619 --> 03:51.013
And your new foster parents,
Dana and Joe?

03:51.056 --> 03:52.623
Are they treating you okay?

03:52.667 --> 03:56.932
- They make pancakes
for dinner if I want.

03:59.282 --> 04:01.850
Oh... I almost forgot.

04:02.633 --> 04:03.808
After everything
she's been through

04:03.852 --> 04:06.071
to have such spirit,
it's just wonderful.

04:06.115 --> 04:09.988
Oh, I'm so happy
the three of you
are hitting it off.

04:10.032 --> 04:13.209
I'll check back in next week
to make sure everyone's okay.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.906
Ooh!

04:16.038 --> 04:19.563
I made you this
to thank you for everything.

04:19.607 --> 04:22.479
- See? I have one too.

04:22.523 --> 04:25.656
I absolutely love it.
Thank you.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.926
A PI office as cover, huh?

04:34.970 --> 04:37.755
I've always found it's best
to hide in plain sight.

04:38.452 --> 04:39.888
I just wanted to say

04:39.931 --> 04:41.629
I appreciate you trusting me
with your secrets, J'onn.

04:41.672 --> 04:43.805
Or should I call you
"Mr. Manhunter"?

04:44.501 --> 04:45.720
"J'onn" will do.

04:47.591 --> 04:50.986
I'm curious. Um, how did
Kara and Nia develop

04:51.029 --> 04:53.641
such close relationships
with the Martian head
of the former DEO?

04:53.684 --> 04:56.861
Let's just say
they have a friend in common.

04:56.905 --> 04:59.516
- Alex, you're, uh--
- My partner in crime.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.649
Welcome to the Tower.

05:03.346 --> 05:04.347
Wow.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.784
This place is incredible.

05:06.828 --> 05:09.047
How do you fund
an operation like this?

05:09.091 --> 05:10.745
Not easily.

05:10.788 --> 05:13.530
You would be amazed
how much these suits cost
to dry clean.

05:15.010 --> 05:17.926
But hey, um, first,
we do have some ground rules.

05:17.969 --> 05:21.016
I don't let my sources dictate
what I write. I'm sorry.

05:21.059 --> 05:23.714
No, it's...
It's nothing like that,
William.

05:23.758 --> 05:26.064
We're never gonna
ask you to lie.

05:26.108 --> 05:29.285
Only that you help us protect
the people of National City

05:29.329 --> 05:32.854
by keeping private
some things that may
jeopardize our missions.

05:32.897 --> 05:35.683
Trust me, I believe
in a free press
more than you know.

05:36.684 --> 05:40.122
Good to hear.
So, how does this work?

05:40.165 --> 05:42.646
Well, you can't disclose
the location of the Tower,

05:42.690 --> 05:46.389
and you can't ID
the Super Friends or even try
to learn their identities.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.391
Not even
my sister Kara knows.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.437
If you do, I'll wipe your mind.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.177
He'll do it.

05:52.221 --> 05:53.570
Yeah.

05:53.614 --> 05:55.485
Oh, and before
you file any story,

05:55.529 --> 05:57.095
just run it
by one of us, please.

05:58.140 --> 05:59.228
Okay.

05:59.271 --> 06:01.404
So, what're you guys
working on now?

06:05.016 --> 06:07.932
It's Naxim's ship.
It's over the city.

06:08.846 --> 06:09.847
Nyxly.

06:18.813 --> 06:20.510
Hey, kid.

06:20.554 --> 06:23.513
I was frightened
before my first big match too.

06:23.557 --> 06:26.124
- I'm not frightened.
- No shame in fear, bro.

06:27.735 --> 06:30.520
Most important is to become one
with your humanity.

06:30.564 --> 06:32.348
What are you?
Some kind of monk?

06:33.088 --> 06:34.263
No.

06:36.265 --> 06:37.745
But I studied with 'em.

06:39.703 --> 06:44.273
The Buddha once sat under
a tree made of this wood.

06:46.580 --> 06:49.931
The vendor swore, dude.
It keeps me focused.

06:59.114 --> 07:01.899
You have no idea
what you're holding
in your hand,

07:02.465 --> 07:04.424
do you, muscle boy?

07:04.467 --> 07:06.991
That is one of the seven keys

07:07.035 --> 07:10.386
to unlocking all the power
of the universe.

07:10.430 --> 07:14.085
And you've just been
carrying it around
in your sweaty pocket

07:14.129 --> 07:18.002
with loose change
and unwrapped candies.

07:19.308 --> 07:20.788
Give it to me.

07:22.311 --> 07:23.312
Now.

07:30.362 --> 07:32.495
<i>Cgyrzyx.</i>

07:32.539 --> 07:36.717
<i>The Totem can belong
only to one of ready heart.</i>

07:36.760 --> 07:38.675
<i>Is that you?</i>

07:38.719 --> 07:41.722
- Yes.
<i>Then use it wisely.</i>

07:49.599 --> 07:50.992
That's it?

07:51.862 --> 07:54.343
There's no... gauntlet?

07:56.780 --> 07:58.260
All right then.

08:14.189 --> 08:15.364
Mitch, now.

08:28.856 --> 08:31.728
J'onn, I'm gonna need backup.

08:31.772 --> 08:35.515
Send everyone.
Send anyone. And hurry.

08:39.344 --> 08:40.998
<i>Police are warning the public</i>

08:41.042 --> 08:44.436
<i>to stay away from midtown
as chaos has erupted...</i>

08:47.222 --> 08:50.442
J'onn stayed back at the arena
to get things under control.

08:50.486 --> 08:53.837
- Sentinel and Guardian did too.
- What happened exactly?

08:53.881 --> 08:55.665
Nyxly got ahold
of another Totem

08:55.709 --> 08:57.188
and activated it
like it was nothing.

08:57.232 --> 09:00.191
And then...
And then, she used it.

09:00.235 --> 09:04.587
And it turned people depraved,
but not cold or unfeeling.

09:04.631 --> 09:06.197
But they're actually gleeful.

09:06.241 --> 09:09.461
They're taking joy in theft
and violence and destruction.

09:09.505 --> 09:13.204
Humanity is everything
we think of as compassion
and empathy.

09:13.248 --> 09:15.946
Exactly the things that Nyxly
drained from her victims.

09:15.990 --> 09:19.384
So the Humanity Totem
is probably
the one Nyxly got.

09:19.428 --> 09:21.735
There had to have been
at least 10,000 people

09:21.778 --> 09:23.432
in the blast radius
of the arena.

09:23.475 --> 09:26.000
But luckily, it seems to have
only affected a couple hundred.

09:26.043 --> 09:28.568
Patching into the NCPD's
CompStat technology,

09:28.611 --> 09:30.570
we can track
real-time crime incidents

09:30.613 --> 09:32.049
represented by the blue dots.

09:34.269 --> 09:36.924
Well, don't look so surprised.
I'm smart too.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.143
You guys are just showoffs.

09:40.275 --> 09:41.668
Hmm.

09:41.711 --> 09:43.887
Did you find anything
in your mom's book?

09:43.931 --> 09:45.976
Uh, yeah,
there is this one spell.

09:46.020 --> 09:47.499
It's "finding which was lost."

09:47.543 --> 09:49.719
Which, if I understand
my mother's writings correctly,

09:49.763 --> 09:53.680
uses the discharged energy
from the Humanity Totem
to track it.

09:53.723 --> 09:55.725
So we find the Totem,
we find Nyxly.

09:55.769 --> 09:57.553
Like a homing beacon.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.816
Lena, this is great.
Can you do it?

09:59.860 --> 10:01.470
It's a bit advanced,

10:01.513 --> 10:03.994
but we've been
readying the lab.

10:04.038 --> 10:06.823
The air within 30 feet
of where Nyxly used the Totem

10:06.867 --> 10:07.998
would have been hyper-ionized.

10:08.042 --> 10:09.609
I just need
a sample of the particles.

10:09.652 --> 10:11.306
I'm on it.

10:11.349 --> 10:15.179
See? Maybe you can find
science in the magic after all.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.141
Could we talk a minute?

10:21.011 --> 10:24.667
- So, Alex caught you up?
- Yeah.

10:24.711 --> 10:29.106
A revenge-obsessed imp
hell-bent on acquiring
interdimensional Totems

10:29.150 --> 10:32.327
capable of wreaking
universal destruction
is here on Earth,

10:32.370 --> 10:34.938
and Lena Luthor
has magical abilities.

10:34.982 --> 10:37.288
Just another Tuesday
in National City.

10:39.682 --> 10:43.860
This Nyxly is unlike anything
the public has faced before.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.775
The threats and strange events
of the past few weeks

10:45.819 --> 10:47.342
are because of her,
aren't they?

10:50.519 --> 10:52.652
The people deserve to know

10:52.695 --> 10:54.828
who and what
they're up against.

10:54.871 --> 10:57.308
There are so many other things
you could write about,

10:57.352 --> 11:00.442
like how we work together
or keep people safe.

11:00.485 --> 11:02.574
Naming Nyxly is about safety.

11:02.618 --> 11:05.099
Keeping this a secret
will only cause more harm.

11:05.142 --> 11:07.362
Nyxly doesn't know
we have Lena right now,

11:07.405 --> 11:08.755
that we have magic.

11:08.798 --> 11:11.105
So if you write about this
and what we're doing,

11:11.148 --> 11:13.498
Nyxly could find a way
to stop us.

11:13.542 --> 11:14.935
But if you write about this

11:14.978 --> 11:16.719
and don't write
about what we're doing,

11:16.763 --> 11:18.286
it'll look like we're losing,

11:18.329 --> 11:20.592
and that
will cause people to panic.

11:20.636 --> 11:23.378
So your only move
is to not write about Nyxly
at all.

11:25.728 --> 11:27.599
- You'd make a good reporter.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.559
Help! Please help!

11:30.602 --> 11:31.647
Duty screams.

11:39.002 --> 11:42.223
How did that home check go
with that little girl...

11:42.266 --> 11:43.572
Esme?

11:44.747 --> 11:46.183
- It was great.
- Oh, I'm so glad.

11:46.227 --> 11:48.229
I know
you were worried about her.

11:51.232 --> 11:53.060
Looks like she's gonna
get her happy ending.

11:53.103 --> 11:54.844
And she made me this
as a thank you.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.193
Aw!

11:57.978 --> 12:00.850
Nice move. And nice bracelet.

12:00.894 --> 12:02.069
<i>Sentinel, Guardian.</i>

12:02.112 --> 12:04.332
<i>NCPD needs help
at 6 o'clock.</i>

12:15.343 --> 12:19.477
"The epicenter
of the inexplicable chaos
seems to be...

12:20.914 --> 12:22.611
Burnett Arena."

12:23.612 --> 12:24.874
Wait, that's my story.

12:24.918 --> 12:27.268
I'm literally
writing it right now.

12:29.096 --> 12:31.185
Have you hacked my computer?

12:31.228 --> 12:34.057
Kara and others are
already covering the chaos.

12:34.101 --> 12:37.234
You are embedded
with the Super Friends.

12:37.278 --> 12:39.323
You need to play up that angle.

12:39.367 --> 12:41.412
What do they know
about what's happening,

12:41.456 --> 12:45.112
when did they find out,
and who is responsible for it?

12:45.155 --> 12:47.810
There are certain things
I'm not able to report on.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.638
At least not yet.

12:49.681 --> 12:53.337
You're the reporter
who broke open
the BX gas scandal in Kaznia.

12:53.381 --> 12:56.384
And you didn't do it
by pussyfooting
around the story.

12:56.427 --> 12:59.953
You're holding out on me.
Start naming names.

12:59.996 --> 13:03.434
The Super Friends
are my sources.

13:03.478 --> 13:05.741
I've only just gained
their trust.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.003
It isn't in my interest

13:07.047 --> 13:09.614
or CatCo's interest
to burn them right away.

13:09.658 --> 13:13.270
The longer I embed with them,
the more I learn,

13:13.314 --> 13:15.446
the better
the eventual story would be.

13:16.839 --> 13:18.275
I see what is happening.

13:18.319 --> 13:19.886
They're making you
feel welcome,

13:19.929 --> 13:22.323
showing you around,
showing off their gadgets,

13:22.366 --> 13:25.108
making you feel
like you're one of them.

13:25.152 --> 13:28.111
- But you are not.
- I know I'm not one of them.

13:28.155 --> 13:30.592
Good, because they may be
the Super friends...

13:31.854 --> 13:34.074
but they are not your friends.

13:34.117 --> 13:36.032
Now come back
with a real story...

13:37.773 --> 13:39.383
or you don't come back at all.

13:49.132 --> 13:52.005
This job
just gets weirder and weirder.

13:54.224 --> 13:55.530
Okay.

14:08.717 --> 14:12.112
<i>Invenire res amissa.</i>

14:18.379 --> 14:20.120
Was there just an energy spike?

14:20.163 --> 14:21.512
Let me check.

14:24.733 --> 14:26.039
- Nia!
- Uh...

14:26.996 --> 14:28.563
I can't...

14:30.173 --> 14:31.696
I can't tell
my lefts from my rights.

14:31.740 --> 14:34.047
Okay, I am so sorry.
I will... I will fix this.

14:34.090 --> 14:35.787
I mean, it's kind of hilarious.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.051
Um...

14:38.094 --> 14:39.922
It's not permanent?

14:39.966 --> 14:43.273
No, no, no. I just must have
miscalculated the ingredients.

14:43.317 --> 14:44.971
It should wear off
in about an hour.

14:45.014 --> 14:48.278
- Any luck with that spell?
- Not yet. But...

14:50.063 --> 14:51.499
Lena broke my brain.

14:52.282 --> 14:53.544
Huh.

14:53.588 --> 14:56.025
Well, the violence out there
is spreading.

14:56.069 --> 14:57.635
The more we fight
these attackers,

14:57.679 --> 15:00.682
the more joyful they seem
in fighting back.

15:05.469 --> 15:06.514
It's Nyxly.

15:07.732 --> 15:09.256
She feels different.

15:09.299 --> 15:11.649
There's no rage anymore,
just... just...

15:12.650 --> 15:13.695
compassion.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.091
I've never felt
anything like this
from her before.

15:18.134 --> 15:19.527
I don't know what this means.

15:19.570 --> 15:22.051
We need that spell
to work, Lena.

15:22.095 --> 15:23.531
And we need it to work now.

15:33.149 --> 15:35.195
- Ah!
Oh!

15:36.457 --> 15:37.762
Oh, Mitch!

15:37.806 --> 15:40.287
You poor, broken thing.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.637
Oh!

15:43.464 --> 15:44.944
We have so much work to do.

15:44.987 --> 15:47.163
I can't possibly lose you now.

15:47.207 --> 15:49.731
Are you, um, feeling okay?

15:50.819 --> 15:51.994
Mmm-hmm.

15:52.038 --> 15:53.343
Never better.

15:53.387 --> 15:55.955
We already have two Totems.

15:55.998 --> 15:59.697
And if the next one
is as easy to use
as the Humanity Totem was,

15:59.741 --> 16:03.397
I expect we'll have
all seven in no time.

16:11.405 --> 16:13.624
The next Totem's at The Hague.

16:15.496 --> 16:17.237
We're going to the Netherlands.

16:18.151 --> 16:19.717
I love travel!

16:27.508 --> 16:29.771
Supergirl brought me
up to speed.

16:29.814 --> 16:31.686
So, Lena Luthor can do magic.

16:31.729 --> 16:32.817
That's off the record.

16:32.861 --> 16:34.254
Of course.
You can trust me.

16:34.297 --> 16:36.691
I'm not sure how accurate
that statement is, anyway.

16:39.128 --> 16:41.087
So, what else
are you working on?

16:41.130 --> 16:43.828
It's a spell
from my mother's book.

16:43.872 --> 16:47.310
I'm trying to track
the Humanity Totem's energy,

16:47.354 --> 16:48.964
and hopefully, Nyxly as well.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.487
This is your mum's book?

16:52.054 --> 16:54.230
Reminds me
of a family recipe book.

16:54.274 --> 16:55.753
Yeah, I guess
you could call it that.

16:56.841 --> 17:00.932
Except I have followed
this spell's recipe to a T,

17:00.976 --> 17:04.371
I have checked
all the directions.

17:04.414 --> 17:08.157
I have measured
all the ingredients twice,
and...

17:08.201 --> 17:11.291
- All I managed to do
was break Dreamer.
- Hmm.

17:13.902 --> 17:15.208
I remember when I was a kid.

17:16.470 --> 17:18.254
Every Sunday I'd wake up

17:18.298 --> 17:20.343
and my dad was already
in the kitchen
tossing something together.

17:21.388 --> 17:23.738
Muffins, scones,
the occasional pie.

17:24.173 --> 17:25.392
You name it.

17:27.916 --> 17:29.265
After he died...

17:30.397 --> 17:32.094
I would try
to recreate his pastries,

17:32.138 --> 17:34.357
but they always
came out... off.

17:36.577 --> 17:39.710
What I eventually realized
was that I was being
too technical.

17:40.711 --> 17:43.062
I was so focused
on the exact measurements,

17:43.105 --> 17:45.412
I'd forgotten the ingredients.

17:47.283 --> 17:49.546
Berries he'd picked
from our garden.

17:50.939 --> 17:52.245
Crust he'd make by hand.

17:53.855 --> 17:55.030
He wasn't just baking.

17:57.119 --> 17:58.555
He was creating.

18:00.122 --> 18:01.428
Put his heart into it.

18:02.559 --> 18:05.997
When I stopped comparing
my skills to my dad's,

18:06.041 --> 18:11.002
and I began to trust myself
to make his recipes my way...

18:13.309 --> 18:16.443
I finally became the baker
I'd always hoped to be.

18:18.488 --> 18:20.403
Next time you try
one of your mum's spells,

18:21.448 --> 18:22.753
put your heart into it.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.627
Maybe you'd be surprised
at the result.

18:34.896 --> 18:35.897
Thank you.

18:57.919 --> 18:58.920
Hey.

18:59.877 --> 19:01.314
Don't worry, hon.

19:01.357 --> 19:03.620
The news said
whatever's happening
is miles away,

19:03.664 --> 19:07.755
and now we've got
plenty of food, water,
and ice cream.

19:08.843 --> 19:11.150
Joe and I
will take care of you, okay?

19:17.634 --> 19:20.028
Aw, you scared, little one?

19:20.942 --> 19:21.899
Good.

19:35.435 --> 19:37.698
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

19:38.307 --> 19:40.266
Oh.

19:40.309 --> 19:42.746
The chaos
is spreading out from the arena
to the waterfront.

19:42.790 --> 19:44.487
Have the satellites
picked up anything?

19:44.531 --> 19:45.706
Spy satellites?

19:47.447 --> 19:50.928
We, uh... we borrowed
some satellites
to track Nyxly's ship.

19:50.972 --> 19:52.452
Yeah, that's off the record.

19:52.495 --> 19:54.367
And, uh, no, nothing.

19:54.932 --> 19:56.891
No Nyxly, no Totem.

19:56.934 --> 19:58.371
We're still at square one.

19:58.893 --> 20:00.503
Maybe not.

20:00.547 --> 20:02.636
The seeds we used
came from a big box store.

20:02.679 --> 20:04.986
They've been packaged,
processed and made dull.

20:05.029 --> 20:08.163
That's not how they would've
been gathered when my mother
wrote the spell.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.556
We need seeds from the wild.

20:10.731 --> 20:12.863
Sheep Laurel
is a flowering shrub

20:12.907 --> 20:14.865
from the Limestone Barrens
of Newfoundland.

20:14.909 --> 20:17.085
Here, it would have to be grown
under the right conditions.

20:17.128 --> 20:19.696
The Botanical Gardens.
That's close to the arena.

20:19.740 --> 20:21.568
Ground zero for the violence.

20:21.611 --> 20:22.656
I'll go get you some.

20:22.699 --> 20:25.136
No. I need to come with you.

20:25.180 --> 20:28.314
The effective particles
are unstable
and diminishing in potency.

20:28.357 --> 20:30.446
I need to be on site
to make the spell work.

20:30.490 --> 20:31.708
I'm coming too.

20:32.709 --> 20:34.015
I was a war correspondent.

20:34.058 --> 20:36.104
Closer I am to the action,
better my reporting.

20:51.206 --> 20:54.470
<i>The Totem is
in an alcove
just off the library.</i>

20:54.514 --> 20:59.040
<i>Get inside and look
for a sculpture called
"The Hand of the Flower."</i>

20:59.083 --> 21:01.477
<i>Kill the guard
without drawing attention.</i>

21:13.446 --> 21:15.535
The Sheep Laurel has to be
around here somewhere.

21:18.189 --> 21:19.800
Oh, there it is.

21:28.722 --> 21:30.898
You protect Lena.
I got this.

21:45.608 --> 21:50.004
<i>Auge navitas
pro omnibus homnibus.</i>

21:50.918 --> 21:56.619
<i>Auge navitas
pro omnibus homnibus.</i>

22:20.861 --> 22:22.863
<i>Nyxly, what's happening?</i>

22:24.691 --> 22:26.693
<i>Kill the guard. Get the Totem.</i>

22:30.610 --> 22:32.176
<i>Nyxly, kill the guard.</i>

22:32.220 --> 22:33.221
I can't do it.

22:33.264 --> 22:35.354
<i>We don't have time. Just do it.</i>

22:35.397 --> 22:36.746
I can't do it.

22:43.231 --> 22:45.364
Guys, she suddenly got violent.

22:45.407 --> 22:46.800
I think I made things worse.

22:52.066 --> 22:54.024
I thought the spell
would locate the Humanity Totem

22:54.068 --> 22:55.678
by amplifying
its energy signature.

22:55.722 --> 22:58.333
But Latin can be interpreted
in a lot of ways.

22:58.377 --> 22:59.595
I mean, I got it wrong.

22:59.639 --> 23:01.467
The spell amplified
the energy's potency.

23:01.510 --> 23:05.209
So the people already affected
were made more callous
and vicious?

23:05.253 --> 23:07.037
Yes. My spell backfired,

23:07.081 --> 23:09.388
and it drained the humanity
from more people in the arena,

23:09.431 --> 23:11.781
and now those people
are running wild
in National City,

23:11.825 --> 23:13.914
and it's my fault.
I'm responsible.

23:13.957 --> 23:15.655
Maybe... maybe you can undo it.

23:15.698 --> 23:18.875
How? I don't even know
how the magical abilities
I can harness

23:18.919 --> 23:20.921
will interact
with Fifth Dimensional energy.

23:20.964 --> 23:23.445
Maybe there's another spell
in your mother's book
you can try.

23:23.489 --> 23:24.881
You want me to try more magic?

23:24.925 --> 23:26.405
Nyxly already has two Totems.

23:26.448 --> 23:28.450
She's probably close
to getting a third.

23:28.494 --> 23:30.234
Science has gotten us nowhere.

23:30.278 --> 23:32.323
Your magic is our only option.

23:37.981 --> 23:43.030
What kind of being hurts others
for their own benefit?

23:44.640 --> 23:47.077
Nyxly, there's something wrong
with you.

23:47.121 --> 23:49.428
The Hope Totem
was yours for the taking.

23:49.471 --> 23:52.126
After everything
you've gone through
to just give up now,

23:52.169 --> 23:53.214
it doesn't make any sense.

23:55.869 --> 23:57.087
Mitch.

23:57.131 --> 23:59.786
Remember how strange
I thought it was that...

24:00.482 --> 24:02.832
The Totem had no gauntlet?

24:02.876 --> 24:07.097
What if...
the Totem is the test?

24:07.141 --> 24:10.710
What if
when I unleashed its power,

24:10.753 --> 24:13.234
it drained
every drop of humanity

24:13.277 --> 24:17.107
from anyone
standing in the blast radius?

24:17.151 --> 24:23.287
What if all that compassion
and empathy flooded into me?

24:24.854 --> 24:26.900
That's why
you couldn't kill the guard.

24:26.943 --> 24:29.250
He might've had children.

24:29.293 --> 24:35.430
He might've had people
who loved him
and cared about him.

24:35.474 --> 24:40.000
All I could think was
how sad they'd be
if I took him away from them.

24:41.871 --> 24:43.264
I can't bear it.

24:43.307 --> 24:44.526
All right.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.615
We already have two Totems now.

24:46.659 --> 24:51.315
Maybe there's a way
of getting the others
without hurting anyone.

24:51.359 --> 24:53.796
That way you get what you want.

24:53.840 --> 24:56.364
And I still get
the life you promised me.

24:58.366 --> 24:59.367
Mitch.

25:03.153 --> 25:05.025
Oh, it's brilliant!

25:05.504 --> 25:06.940
You're brilliant.

25:07.549 --> 25:08.811
Thank you.

25:09.638 --> 25:11.727
You're always
thinking about me.

25:30.964 --> 25:32.008
Guys.

25:32.052 --> 25:34.576
Nyxly is overwhelmed
with feelings.

25:34.620 --> 25:37.666
It's almost like
all of the humanity
she took from her victims

25:37.710 --> 25:40.016
had to go somewhere,
and now it's going into her.

25:40.060 --> 25:42.279
Wait, you said that Nyxly
used the Totem immediately.

25:42.323 --> 25:44.194
But that would mean
that there's no gauntlet.

25:44.238 --> 25:46.980
And from all of our research,
we know that there's
always a gauntlet.

25:47.023 --> 25:50.200
That could mean that
using the Totem itself
is the gauntlet.

25:50.244 --> 25:53.116
And we may be able to use that
to our advantage.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.553
How?

25:54.596 --> 25:57.207
By repeating Lena's mistake
at the Botanical Gardens

25:57.251 --> 25:59.906
and taking more humanity away
from the original people

25:59.949 --> 26:01.821
that were affected at the arena
in the first place.

26:01.864 --> 26:06.434
And in the same way
that National City
is overrun by chaos right now,

26:06.477 --> 26:08.610
if we flood Nyxly
with emotions,

26:08.654 --> 26:10.830
it might be
too much for her to handle.

26:10.873 --> 26:13.049
And... and it might force her

26:13.093 --> 26:16.966
to restore everyone's humanity
and get rid of the Totem.

26:17.010 --> 26:19.229
It'd be sure to draw her out.

26:19.273 --> 26:21.928
We could capture
the Totems and Nyxly.

26:21.971 --> 26:23.756
We can end this today.

26:25.540 --> 26:27.542
- Can't do it.
- What?

26:27.586 --> 26:28.891
I won't do it.

26:29.326 --> 26:30.414
It's wrong.

26:30.458 --> 26:32.895
Lena, people need help now.
This...

26:32.939 --> 26:34.418
This is for the greater good.

26:34.462 --> 26:36.072
For the greater good?

26:36.116 --> 26:37.596
Do you hear yourself right now?

26:37.639 --> 26:39.685
- That's not what I meant.
Um...

26:39.728 --> 26:41.643
William, have I shown you
the kitchen yet?

26:41.687 --> 26:45.255
We have a new coffee machine
that is literally
out of this world.

26:45.299 --> 26:47.606
Brainy picked it up
from Corvon-4...

26:47.649 --> 26:50.391
I can't believe
you would not help.

26:50.434 --> 26:52.611
Not if it means losing
who we are in the process

26:52.654 --> 26:54.525
because then we're no better
than she is.

26:54.569 --> 26:57.267
I know that you are
still processing the fact
that you can use magic,

26:57.311 --> 26:59.748
and I know
that I've been pushing you
out of your comfort zone.

26:59.792 --> 27:02.533
But that's only because
I believe in you, and...

27:04.231 --> 27:05.449
I'm...

27:05.493 --> 27:06.799
I'm terrified.

27:07.930 --> 27:10.759
She makes me feel powerless.

27:10.803 --> 27:13.893
Nyxly's magic is unlike
anything I've ever faced.

27:13.936 --> 27:15.503
I feel like
I don't know how to beat her,

27:15.546 --> 27:17.244
and if she gets
all seven Totems,

27:17.287 --> 27:18.158
I won't be able to.

27:18.201 --> 27:20.421
You can do something I can't.

27:20.464 --> 27:22.466
I need your help, Lena.

27:22.510 --> 27:24.860
From everything
you've told me about Nyxly,

27:24.904 --> 27:26.296
she's more than just her magic.

27:26.340 --> 27:28.777
She is cunning
and manipulative and cruel.

27:28.821 --> 27:30.387
Who does that remind you of?

27:32.128 --> 27:33.521
Lex.

27:33.564 --> 27:36.655
You've beat him before
and you will beat Nyxly too,

27:36.698 --> 27:38.961
but not by doing
whatever it takes to win.

27:39.701 --> 27:41.311
By doing the right thing.

27:43.052 --> 27:45.838
My mother hurt people
with her magic.

27:47.013 --> 27:49.015
Unintentionally, but...

27:49.058 --> 27:51.104
She hid the truth
of what happened,

27:51.147 --> 27:53.410
and that secret
destroyed lives.

27:54.760 --> 27:55.935
I'm so sorry.

27:57.110 --> 27:59.634
Nyxly has caused so much pain.

28:00.940 --> 28:04.552
And I don't wanna hurt anybody
with my magic or deceit.

28:07.337 --> 28:09.296
You're right.

28:09.339 --> 28:12.865
Mmm, you're right. We can't
cross lines in darkness,

28:12.908 --> 28:14.997
however good the reasons.

28:15.041 --> 28:17.608
Secrets are hard to hide
in the light of day.

28:21.221 --> 28:23.179
But maybe...

28:23.223 --> 28:25.312
But maybe the light of day
is just what we need.

28:28.881 --> 28:32.145
I did not come here
to report on
the Tower's kitchen appliances.

28:32.798 --> 28:33.799
Excuse me?

28:33.842 --> 28:35.409
Why did you
even allow me in here

28:35.452 --> 28:37.280
if you won't let me report
what's really going on?

28:37.324 --> 28:38.978
You agreed to our ground rules.

28:39.021 --> 28:41.371
The situation has changed.

28:41.415 --> 28:42.982
The violence in the city
is getting worse.

28:43.025 --> 28:44.679
You guys have no plan.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.115
Yes, we do.

28:47.247 --> 28:51.251
Lena is going to amplify
the Totem's power...

28:51.294 --> 28:55.081
so that everyone who was
within Nyxly's blast radius
at the arena

28:55.124 --> 28:57.344
will lose their humanity, too.

28:57.387 --> 29:00.042
We believe that Nyxly
is being infused
with the compassion

29:00.086 --> 29:01.652
that she's drained
from her victims.

29:01.696 --> 29:04.090
With more people affected,
we think she'll get overwhelmed

29:04.133 --> 29:06.875
and then use the Totem again
to restore everyone's humanity.

29:06.919 --> 29:08.529
Okay, but doing so will cause

29:08.572 --> 29:11.401
even more chaos and destruction
throughout the entire city.

29:11.445 --> 29:15.318
So, we'll have to spread out
and try our best
to keep the city safe.

29:15.362 --> 29:16.102
Until when?

29:16.145 --> 29:17.277
Until Nyxly's drawn out.

29:17.320 --> 29:20.410
If she comes out.
She might not.

29:20.454 --> 29:22.412
And the longer
people are affected
by the Totem's power,

29:22.456 --> 29:24.153
the less they seem
to care about anything.

29:24.197 --> 29:26.852
This is a dangerous situation.

29:26.895 --> 29:28.767
Lena, you were
against this plan before.

29:28.810 --> 29:29.985
What changed?

29:31.639 --> 29:33.249
You.

29:33.293 --> 29:34.685
You have to write about
what's going on here,

29:34.729 --> 29:37.123
so people can't accuse us
of operating in secret.

29:37.166 --> 29:39.908
The time has come
for full transparency.

29:39.952 --> 29:41.910
By shining a light
on our actions,

29:41.954 --> 29:45.131
the people will be able
to make up their own opinions
about our methods.

29:45.174 --> 29:49.570
If I agree to this,
I tell the story my way.

29:49.613 --> 29:52.442
Nyxly's identification,
her search for the Totems,

29:52.486 --> 29:55.228
and the role of magic
in all this.

29:56.533 --> 29:59.014
Those are my ground rules.

30:03.236 --> 30:05.325
All right, tell your story.

30:05.368 --> 30:07.631
I'll set the computers
to scan for Nyxly's ship

30:07.675 --> 30:09.503
and alert us if he shows up.

30:10.417 --> 30:11.679
I hope this works.

30:14.116 --> 30:16.597
You wanted closer
to the action, you got it.

30:23.517 --> 30:25.649
You sure you want to be
out in the open to do this?

30:26.955 --> 30:29.131
I've gotta get out of my head
and I can't do that in a lab.

30:29.175 --> 30:32.743
<i>Okay. We'll keep people
from getting hurt
when your spell hits them.</i>

30:37.357 --> 30:50.196
<i>Auge navitas
pro omnibus homnibus.</i>

31:13.175 --> 31:15.874
<i>J'onn, there's
a carjacking happening
at Maine and 5th.</i>

31:15.917 --> 31:17.179
<i>I'm on it.</i>

31:18.006 --> 31:20.400
Help, somebody!
My son is in there!

31:34.022 --> 31:36.720
<i>Dreamer, there's
a situation at the bus stop
on 8th.</i>

31:39.680 --> 31:40.724
Sleep tight.

31:46.034 --> 31:47.470
- Hi.

31:47.514 --> 31:49.255
All good here, Supergirl.

31:49.298 --> 31:51.561
No. No, no more.

31:56.175 --> 31:57.611
Get a grip, girl.

31:58.829 --> 32:00.092
It's only the Totem...

32:01.528 --> 32:03.095
Messing with you.

32:05.662 --> 32:07.316
Concentrate.

32:07.360 --> 32:10.493
Concentrate on getting
the next one.

32:13.801 --> 32:14.889
The Hope Totem.

32:18.327 --> 32:21.722
How can I be expected
to get anything done

32:23.071 --> 32:27.380
when there's so much
suffering on this planet?

32:27.423 --> 32:29.556
If only I didn't have
this damn cuff,

32:29.599 --> 32:35.170
I could snap away poverty,
disease, hunger.

32:37.781 --> 32:41.785
I could save the snow leopards
from extinction.

32:43.526 --> 32:46.486
Am I the only one that cares?

32:54.363 --> 32:55.669
- Let me in!
- It's okay, Esme.

32:55.712 --> 32:57.453
Just do your
fire breathing thing again.

32:57.497 --> 33:00.804
I told you,
I don't know how I did it.

33:00.848 --> 33:02.545
It was an accident.

33:02.589 --> 33:05.113
Just be a big girl.
You can have
some ice cream later, okay?

33:05.157 --> 33:06.549
Keep us safe.

33:08.943 --> 33:10.597
Look what we have here.

33:11.859 --> 33:13.034
Step aside--

33:13.078 --> 33:14.688
Ow!

33:17.125 --> 33:18.387
You're safe now.

33:23.523 --> 33:25.568
We won't let anyone hurt you.

33:30.791 --> 33:31.966
Where we going?

33:34.316 --> 33:35.665
National City.

33:35.709 --> 33:38.364
I'm giving everyone
their humanity back.

33:38.712 --> 33:39.713
Now.

33:39.756 --> 33:40.757
You can't!

33:43.064 --> 33:44.544
What I can't do...

33:49.070 --> 33:52.508
Is take it anymore.

33:52.552 --> 33:54.641
How am I going to hunt down
the other Totems

33:54.684 --> 33:58.384
if I don't stop
feeling so deeply?

34:00.342 --> 34:04.694
If we leave the ship,
Supergirl will be able
to find us.

34:05.913 --> 34:07.306
I don't care.

34:15.401 --> 34:16.619
Please don't hurt me.

34:17.794 --> 34:20.449
Help! Help!

34:47.346 --> 34:48.564
You're gonna be okay.

34:49.130 --> 34:50.305
Thank you.

34:51.263 --> 34:52.960
I hope we all will be.

34:53.003 --> 34:55.571
<i>Supergirl,
we got a hit on Nyxly's ship.</i>

35:26.080 --> 35:27.386
<i>Cgyrzyx!</i>

35:47.884 --> 35:49.930
Hey, boss. Feeling better?

35:52.628 --> 35:53.629
No.

35:54.761 --> 35:56.502
No!

35:56.545 --> 35:58.504
Why did you let me
get rid of the Totem?

35:59.200 --> 36:01.071
Fly down. Get it.

36:05.206 --> 36:06.251
Change of plans.

36:06.294 --> 36:07.687
Get us out of here.

36:27.228 --> 36:29.839
Hard to believe
a small piece
of wood from the bodhi tree

36:29.883 --> 36:31.276
can cause so much chaos.

36:31.319 --> 36:32.842
Well, now that Nyxly's back
to her old self,

36:32.886 --> 36:34.844
she'll no doubt be on the hunt
for another Totem.

36:34.888 --> 36:37.760
And now she's lost
her Humanity Totem,
she'll be angrier than ever.

36:37.804 --> 36:39.588
When William
publishes his article,

36:39.632 --> 36:42.504
everyone in National City's
gonna know about her
and the Totems.

36:42.548 --> 36:44.506
And that the Super Friends
have evened the score.

36:44.550 --> 36:47.030
It's time
we get a head start on Nyxly.

36:47.074 --> 36:48.467
Any ideas how?

36:48.510 --> 36:49.946
I still have some of those
ionized particles left.

36:49.990 --> 36:51.296
They're still active.

36:51.339 --> 36:52.775
Each of the Totems
has the same energy signal,

36:52.819 --> 36:55.300
so we could use the particles
to track another one.

36:55.343 --> 36:57.650
There's just enough left
for one, though.

36:57.693 --> 37:01.393
Okay, so,
which one do we go after?

37:01.436 --> 37:03.090
Well, there's the Dream Totem.

37:06.659 --> 37:09.444
Sounds like something
I might be able to help with.

37:13.231 --> 37:16.712
William,
your article is fantastic.

37:16.756 --> 37:19.846
"A frustrated imp
hell-bent on revenge."

37:19.889 --> 37:23.284
"The Super Friends in a race
to get powerful Totems."

37:23.328 --> 37:25.373
"Magic?"

37:25.417 --> 37:27.549
Our readers
are gonna eat this up.

37:27.593 --> 37:28.942
I'm glad you liked it.

37:28.985 --> 37:29.986
I love it.

37:30.030 --> 37:31.466
And now for your follow-up,

37:31.510 --> 37:35.340
this Tower the Super Friends
work out of, where is it?

37:35.383 --> 37:38.908
And what are their plans
to defeat this "Nyxly"?

37:38.952 --> 37:41.781
Oh, and you must reveal
who among the Super Friends

37:41.824 --> 37:44.044
has the magical power
to fight her.

37:45.132 --> 37:46.133
No.

37:47.526 --> 37:48.788
I'm sorry. Did you say no?

37:48.831 --> 37:50.920
I'm the one embedded
with the Super Friends.

37:50.964 --> 37:54.315
So I'm going
to cover the story my way.

37:54.359 --> 37:56.839
Not theirs, and not yours.

37:57.840 --> 38:01.931
You don't get to tell me
how to do my job anymore.

38:01.975 --> 38:04.325
Now you can either take
the stories I give you,

38:04.369 --> 38:08.895
or I am sure the Daily Planet
would be interested
in running them.

38:10.810 --> 38:11.854
Hmm.

38:13.247 --> 38:14.770
Fine.

38:14.814 --> 38:17.469
But I'm moving your desk
next to the bathrooms.

38:27.609 --> 38:29.307
Hey.
- Hey.

38:29.350 --> 38:31.874
- How's William's article?
- It's fantastic.

38:31.918 --> 38:33.267
I saw J'onn
reading it early on,

38:33.311 --> 38:34.529
but I couldn't tell
if he liked it.

38:34.573 --> 38:36.966
Yeah, he likes to
play it close to the vest.

38:37.010 --> 38:40.535
But it's out there now.
There's no turning back.

38:40.579 --> 38:43.843
I just hope
people will understand
why we did what we had to do.

38:43.886 --> 38:45.148
Some will.

38:45.192 --> 38:48.064
Others will accuse us
of abusing our power.

38:48.108 --> 38:50.676
But at least we can
debate about it in the open.

38:51.154 --> 38:52.199
Yeah.

38:52.895 --> 38:54.375
You know, I wanted to thank you

38:54.419 --> 38:56.508
for helping me
get outside my comfort zone

38:56.551 --> 38:58.858
and embrace my magic.

38:58.901 --> 39:04.298
And thank you for reminding me
that it's important to have
clear boundaries with friends.

39:05.734 --> 39:07.649
- Potsticker me.
- Here. Take 'em.

39:07.693 --> 39:08.737
I don't want to use my fingers.

39:08.781 --> 39:10.826
- I'm going to.
- Oh, that's classy.

39:10.870 --> 39:13.786
- Mmm-hmm. You know me.

39:13.829 --> 39:15.614
I'm here for you, Esme.

39:15.657 --> 39:18.007
Did Mrs. Ford
remember to pack everything?

39:18.051 --> 39:19.182
I think so.

39:20.836 --> 39:22.055
Hi.

39:22.098 --> 39:26.364
Esme, this is Alex Danvers,
my girlfriend.

39:26.407 --> 39:28.322
Hello, Ms. Danvers.

39:28.366 --> 39:31.717
Hi, Esme.
I've heard a lot about you.

39:32.500 --> 39:33.501
You have?

39:33.545 --> 39:36.199
I have.
And it's all good things.

39:37.636 --> 39:40.029
So, what's going on?

39:40.073 --> 39:41.161
Uh...

39:41.204 --> 39:43.163
Esme, will you excuse us
for a minute?

39:43.555 --> 39:44.730
Okay.

39:48.908 --> 39:49.909
Hon...

39:51.301 --> 39:54.435
we are waiting for the van
from Social Services.

39:54.479 --> 39:56.872
The Fords changed their mind.

39:56.916 --> 40:00.876
They requested
another placement for Esme.

40:00.920 --> 40:02.878
- They're giving her back?
- Mmm-hmm.

40:02.922 --> 40:05.185
They said she's not a right fit
for their family.

40:05.881 --> 40:07.535
Oh, but she was a right fit

40:07.579 --> 40:10.146
when they forced her
to confront armed attackers?

40:10.190 --> 40:12.235
I told them even though
she's an alien with powers,

40:12.279 --> 40:14.281
it was their job
to protect her.

40:14.324 --> 40:16.936
- Not the other way around.
- Good for you, babe.

40:16.979 --> 40:18.807
'Cause I would have
punched their lights out.

40:21.941 --> 40:26.032
I know going back
to the group home wasn't
what you were hoping for.

40:26.075 --> 40:29.252
But it's only
a matter of time till you get
a new foster family.

40:29.296 --> 40:32.734
One that can help you
understand your powers.

40:32.778 --> 40:35.084
It's okay if the next one
doesn't work out either.

40:35.128 --> 40:37.391
I'm never going to have
a real home.

41:09.075 --> 41:10.163
Come here, kiddo.

41:14.297 --> 41:17.257
- You're so strong.
- Can I take your bag for you?

41:18.301 --> 41:19.651
It's okay.

41:29.965 --> 41:33.099
It's good to have you
back to your old self.

41:34.622 --> 41:38.887
I mean, let's figure out
how to get this Hope Totem
out of The Hague.

41:38.931 --> 41:41.847
Losing the Humanity Totem
was a blip in the road.

41:42.674 --> 41:44.110
It will be mine again.

41:44.763 --> 41:46.112
They all will.

41:47.200 --> 41:50.420
No matter what I have to do
to get them.
