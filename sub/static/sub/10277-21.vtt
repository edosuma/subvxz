01:33.912 --> 01:36.706
Sweetheart, go back to sleep, okay?

01:48.926 --> 01:51.595
What happened?
Did you have a bad dream?

01:53.805 --> 01:56.558
Oh, man, T ess. You're killing me.

01:56.767 --> 01:58.226
Abby?

01:59.102 --> 02:01.938
- Abby!
- Y eah?

02:02.105 --> 02:05.400
A 22-year-old with pelvic pain
is coming in.

02:05.984 --> 02:07.027
Okay.

02:07.235 --> 02:09.446
- You getting up?
- Yep.

02:10.280 --> 02:12.656
You want me to wake Malucci?

02:16.535 --> 02:19.872
Nope. I'm up. I'm sorry.

02:21.165 --> 02:24.251
- How long was I out?
- About 20 minutes.

02:24.460 --> 02:27.546
That must be why I feel so refreshed.

02:29.131 --> 02:33.636
Is this a med-student hazing
or do you guys just hate me?

02:33.844 --> 02:37.513
You're younger than us, prettier than us
and skinnier than us.

02:37.514 --> 02:38.514
We hate you.

02:41.476 --> 02:44.354
- Thanks for the candor.
- Anytime.

02:46.147 --> 02:47.648
It's cold out here.
I should've brought my jacket.

02:47.857 --> 02:52.153
Go back in. We don't need your
help pushing a gurney.

02:53.988 --> 02:57.978
You know, I never actually thought
I'd get into med school.

02:58.013 --> 02:59.702
I was just looking for a change.

02:59.952 --> 03:03.497
Stop talking before
one of us hits you.

03:45.829 --> 03:47.247
I love you.

03:49.875 --> 03:52.002
Do I tell you that enough?

03:54.963 --> 03:56.672
I love you.

04:58.732 --> 05:01.901
- I didn't know you play basketball.
- I don't.

05:02.110 --> 05:05.155
Helo, Tess. Did you let
your mommy sleep for a change?

05:05.363 --> 05:07.782
No, she did not.

05:09.701 --> 05:11.619
Did I make you angry?

05:12.328 --> 05:16.790
- The flowers on your birthday?
- No. They were beautiful.

05:17.374 --> 05:20.210
They weren't animal crackers, huh?

05:21.086 --> 05:22.880
You heard about that?

05:23.964 --> 05:26.091
Are you still in love with him?

05:27.843 --> 05:32.139
I don't know. I'm too angry
with him to think straight.

05:32.306 --> 05:35.100
- I would think so.
- Why?

05:36.393 --> 05:40.146
No. Doug didn't know I was
pregnant when he left.

05:40.438 --> 05:42.231
He didn't come back when he knew.

05:42.398 --> 05:45.359
Well, it wasn't all Doug.
I could've gone with him.

05:45.609 --> 05:48.487
- He asked me to.
- Why didn't you?

05:49.905 --> 05:51.032
Pride.

05:52.116 --> 05:54.160
I wanted him to stay for me.

05:54.535 --> 05:57.872
I thought I should be at least
that important to him.

05:58.080 --> 05:59.957
I still love my wife.

06:02.251 --> 06:04.961
But it's time to get on with my life.

06:08.464 --> 06:12.744
Let's help your mommy get inside, huh?
Here we go.

06:12.811 --> 06:14.596
Like a cowboy.

06:22.186 --> 06:26.024
- Slide your bottom down a bit.
- I hate these!

06:26.190 --> 06:29.027
How many sex partners have you had?

06:29.193 --> 06:31.486
- One.
- Do you use condoms?

06:31.737 --> 06:34.656
Most of the time. Am I pregnant?

06:34.865 --> 06:38.660
No. The urine test came back negative.

06:38.910 --> 06:43.290
- That didn't hurt at all.
- Warm water. I know a few tricks.

06:43.498 --> 06:47.377
You don't freeze them?
I'll tell my gynecologist.

06:47.586 --> 06:50.422
- Cultures?
- GC and chlamydia?

06:50.922 --> 06:52.716
I might have chlamydia?

06:52.882 --> 06:55.384
We check everybody for STDs.

06:55.593 --> 06:57.678
Discharge at the cervix.

06:57.886 --> 07:02.558
I've had a boyfriend for a year.
If he gave me an STD, I'll kill him.

07:02.766 --> 07:07.730
We haven't made a diagnosis yet.
Speculum's coming out.

07:08.981 --> 07:12.359
I'll move your cervix.
Tell me if it hurts.

07:13.735 --> 07:15.904
Sorry. Only way to do that.

07:16.071 --> 07:18.907
I'll be gentle with your ovaries.

07:21.576 --> 07:26.205
Put your legs down. You seem fine.
It's probably PID.

07:26.414 --> 07:28.833
- PID?
- Pelvic inflammatory disease.

07:29.041 --> 07:31.794
You'll get antibiotics, pills...

07:32.003 --> 07:35.089
...and a painkiller.
You can get dressed.

07:35.298 --> 07:38.134
250 of ceftriaxone,

07:38.217 --> 07:40.177
a gram of Zithromax and 550 of Anaprox.

07:40.386 --> 07:42.972
Hang on there for 30 minutes, make sure
she doesn't have an allergic reaction.

07:43.180 --> 07:46.475
- Should Malucci sign off?
- Let him sleep.

07:46.683 --> 07:51.187
- I'll find Weaver.
- She's on her second double this week.

07:51.396 --> 07:54.566
- I wouldn't.
- She's upstairs. CCU had a code.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.192
Mark's back today.

07:56.359 --> 07:59.904
If Weaver gets nastier,
I'm calling Animal Control.

08:00.405 --> 08:03.908
- Amira! Amira!
- Frank.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.786
- Where's Amira?
- Got off at 7:00.

08:06.995 --> 08:09.330
- Who are you?
- Frank. Personnel sent me.

08:09.539 --> 08:12.416
- Any experience?
-26 years as a cop.

08:12.624 --> 08:15.627
- In medicine?
- Had my knee replaced.

08:15.836 --> 08:19.047
- Why are all these people here?
- Sick?

08:19.256 --> 08:22.217
What an astute,
penetrating observation.

08:22.426 --> 08:25.387
- Where are the doctors?
- I don't know.

08:25.554 --> 08:28.557
- No docs. Abby's in Sutures.
- Malucci?

08:28.765 --> 08:30.934
- He's asleep in Exam 1.
- Kovac?

08:31.143 --> 08:32.184
Foreign guy?

08:32.486 --> 08:34.980
He and a some nurse came in together
and took her babies upstairs to daycare.

08:35.188 --> 08:39.400
- Dr. Chen? Dr. Carter?
- I think they're in the lounge.

08:39.607 --> 08:43.130
It's 7:05. Was there a natural
disaster I'm unaware of?

08:43.164 --> 08:46.369
An earthquake? Or has been Chicago
swallowed by a drowning sinkhole?

08:46.404 --> 08:48.534
Could you stop yelling at me?
I was here on time.

08:48.742 --> 08:52.746
Mark will be in by 10.
He went to the mortuary.

08:52.955 --> 08:54.915
Still have that whistle?

08:55.165 --> 08:58.544
Phone everybody who's supposed to be here
and scream at their machine...

08:58.552 --> 09:02.172
that they're late. And if they answer,
tell them they're fired.

09:02.548 --> 09:05.591
Rise and shine! Patients are waiting!

09:06.175 --> 09:08.872
Dr. Malucci, if I don't see you
standing over a sick patient...

09:08.873 --> 09:11.769
looking compasionate and engaged
in the next 30 seconds,

09:11.805 --> 09:14.392
you're gonna spend the next week
doing disimpactions and yeast infections!

09:14.934 --> 09:17.562
- I'm up, chief, I'm up. True.
- I go away for 20 minutes...

09:17.570 --> 09:21.065
...and this place goes to hell!
The lounge?

09:26.445 --> 09:28.305
She uses a whistle?

09:31.241 --> 09:33.702
- You okay, John?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

09:33.952 --> 09:36.788
- You look terrible.
- Thank you.

09:39.833 --> 09:43.920
- What time do you have?
-7:05.

09:44.129 --> 09:46.965
The 7:00 shift starts at 7:00.

09:47.215 --> 09:50.927
That means you see patients at 7:00.
Clear?

09:51.177 --> 09:55.138
Move it! County's not paying you
to drink coffee!

09:55.347 --> 09:58.141
Somebody woke up on the wrong side
of the coffin.

09:58.350 --> 10:00.143
T oday ought to be fun.

10:00.394 --> 10:04.564
Weak and dizzy, Exam 2.
Abdominal pain, Curtain 1.

10:04.773 --> 10:07.275
- Bleeding hemorrhoids in 8.
- Chief!

10:07.526 --> 10:11.154
- And a boil that needs lancing.
- T errific.

10:11.363 --> 10:14.658
- Is that unbridled enthusiasm?
- Can't wait.

10:14.866 --> 10:17.411
Keep an eye on your med student.

10:17.661 --> 10:20.163
- Where's Abby?
- PID down in Sutures.

10:20.372 --> 10:22.248
You're supervising?

10:22.456 --> 10:25.668
Take the pyelo lady in Curtain 3.

10:25.876 --> 10:28.504
Rule-out Ml or a nail through
the hand?

10:28.712 --> 10:29.713
Both.

10:30.005 --> 10:32.633
A terminal cancer patient's
coming in.

10:32.883 --> 10:36.637
Let's go. Plenty more
where these came from.

10:36.845 --> 10:40.057
I went to medical school
for a butt boil?

10:40.224 --> 10:43.018
Could be worse.
There's an explosive diarrhea.

10:43.227 --> 10:46.479
- You don't look so good.
- So I hear.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.856
I'm having trouble sleeping.

10:49.107 --> 10:53.027
Read the Annals at bedtime.
Puts me right out.

10:53.277 --> 10:56.239
Want me to dip a urine on our pyelo?

10:56.447 --> 10:59.659
I'll be in after I use the bathroom.

11:00.076 --> 11:03.496
- You on all night?
- I swapped shifts with Cleo.

11:03.704 --> 11:06.749
I got Rage Against the Machine
tickets.

11:06.958 --> 11:09.210
- Right in the pit.
- Lucky you.

11:09.377 --> 11:13.421
Weaver's got it in for me.
What'd I do to Festus?

11:13.672 --> 11:16.800
- You call her Festus.
- Not to her face.

11:37.403 --> 11:39.571
- How's it going?
- All right.

11:56.672 --> 12:00.467
- I couldn't wake her up.
- BP is 85 over 60.

12:00.634 --> 12:03.220
- She hasn't eaten in two days.
- Fluids?

12:03.428 --> 12:07.264
Some ginger ale. She had a bowel
obstruction last month.

12:07.473 --> 12:11.268
The tumor spread to her liver
and diaphragm.

12:11.435 --> 12:14.814
- Could be encephalopathic.
- What's that mean?

12:14.980 --> 12:17.691
Her liver isn't removing toxins.

12:17.942 --> 12:20.486
That might be why she can't wake up.

12:20.694 --> 12:24.949
Here we go. Gently now.
And one, two, three.

12:25.115 --> 12:27.868
Get CBC, 'lytes, liver panel and PT.

12:28.077 --> 12:30.036
Her resps are down to eight.

12:30.286 --> 12:33.081
Your wife's breathing's very slow.

12:33.289 --> 12:37.335
- We may have to decide to intubate.
- Oh, God.

12:37.877 --> 12:43.257
- Is she a "do-not-resuscitate"?
- Yes. She doesn't want any machines.

12:43.466 --> 12:47.345
She'll get IV fluids to make
her more comfortable.

12:47.470 --> 12:51.182
Could you show the O'Briens
to the waiting area?

12:51.390 --> 12:55.268
Let's find you some crayons
and coloring books, okay?

12:55.852 --> 12:58.063
Bye-bye, Mommy.

13:01.441 --> 13:04.444
- Come on, sweetheart.
- I brought her things.

13:04.694 --> 13:09.574
That's my job. She likes to
have her things with her.

13:12.661 --> 13:17.999
We need a place to put them. Could you
hold onto them a while?

13:18.249 --> 13:22.002
All right, sweetie. All right.
Come on.

13:32.679 --> 13:35.182
- So, Mrs...?
- Wyatt.

13:36.725 --> 13:41.688
- How long have you had the burning?
- Couple of days. Usually clears up.

13:42.231 --> 13:44.399
- Any fever?
-101.4.

13:44.566 --> 13:46.817
Open your mouth for me.

13:47.026 --> 13:49.570
Weaver sent you a wheezer.

13:49.737 --> 13:51.030
Would you excuse me?

13:57.703 --> 13:59.663
- History of asthma?
- Since I was a kid.

13:59.872 --> 14:02.291
Get him into bed.
Give him five of albuterol.

14:02.500 --> 14:05.377
Sit up, please. Does this hurt?

14:05.586 --> 14:09.089
- Oh! Oh! Y eah.
- You've got pyelonephritis.

14:09.298 --> 14:11.300
- Is it serious?
- You'll be fine.

14:11.509 --> 14:14.469
- Need a hand?
- No, no. I've got this.

14:14.677 --> 14:18.806
- Ever been on steroids?
- Last year. Few weeks.

14:19.057 --> 14:23.728
60 of prednisone. Set him up
for continuous nebs.

14:23.895 --> 14:26.022
- Your last period?
- A month ago.

14:26.230 --> 14:30.443
- You sure? I'm waiting on labs.
- I got them. Thanks.

14:31.277 --> 14:34.072
- Any allergies?
- I get hives from sulfa.

14:34.322 --> 14:38.325
- What inhalers do you use?
- Ventolin and Vanceril.

14:38.492 --> 14:42.245
- Any chance you're pregnant?
- Definitely not.

14:47.334 --> 14:50.545
I got scared when I couldn't wake her.

14:50.712 --> 14:54.216
You were right to call 911.
She's dehydrated.

14:54.424 --> 14:58.178
I tried to make her drink.
She's so weak she can't swallow.

14:58.386 --> 15:02.307
- She hardly holds a straw.
- Labs are back.

15:07.603 --> 15:11.440
- Her liver's not clotting.
- What does that mean?

15:11.774 --> 15:14.610
It indicates severe liver failure.

15:16.070 --> 15:17.905
Can anything be done?

15:18.530 --> 15:22.451
Not really. We can only
make her comfortable now.

15:24.244 --> 15:25.871
So this is it?

15:27.831 --> 15:29.665
I think probably so.

15:34.879 --> 15:36.547
Oh, boy.

15:39.050 --> 15:43.804
- Where are my girls?
- They're in the lounge with a nurse.

15:49.393 --> 15:51.395
Do everything you can.

15:52.396 --> 15:55.398
I don't want her to suffer. Please.

15:55.899 --> 15:57.358
Of course not.

15:58.777 --> 16:01.029
Come back if you have fever
or vomiting.

16:01.237 --> 16:06.159
- I'll get a list of STD clinics.
- I'll be outside. I need a smoke.

16:06.367 --> 16:11.039
- But you'll quit really soon, right?
- Absolutely.

16:13.583 --> 16:17.795
22-year-old with PID. Gave her
ceftriaxone and Zithromax.

16:18.004 --> 16:20.714
- Could you sign the chart?
- Benton on?

16:20.922 --> 16:24.551
Benton traded with Corday
and Cleo's off too.

16:24.760 --> 16:25.927
Shocking.

16:26.136 --> 16:30.223
This date's wrong.
T oday's the 11 th, not the 1 Oth.

16:30.474 --> 16:34.644
- I thought tomorrow's the 11 th.
- Today is, all day.

16:34.853 --> 16:38.982
I expected today to be awful,
but it seems okay.

16:39.191 --> 16:41.810
Venus out of alignment with Jupiter?

16:41.877 --> 16:43.320
No, nothing like that.

16:43.486 --> 16:46.947
Jupiter has eight moons.
Shall I name them?

16:47.114 --> 16:49.825
- Who is this guy?
- Frank. A temp.

16:49.950 --> 16:52.286
Now let's see. Inner moons:

16:52.453 --> 16:55.873
- Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea-
- I believe you.

16:56.081 --> 16:59.501
Hemorrhoid guy's suppository is
not helping.

16:59.710 --> 17:03.338
Outer moons: lo, Europa,
Ganymede, Callisto.

17:03.547 --> 17:05.632
- What's he saying?
- Moons.

17:05.924 --> 17:08.635
Saturn has 18 moons.
Shall I name them?

17:09.803 --> 17:12.637
- No.
- The PID girl collapsed in the bay.

17:13.097 --> 17:16.559
- What happened?
- She's breathing. Barely a pulse.

17:16.934 --> 17:20.896
She needs two large-bore IVs,
two liters saline.

17:21.063 --> 17:23.190
- Wake up.
- Is it an ectopic?

17:23.441 --> 17:25.818
- No, ICON's negative.
- BP 70 palp.

17:26.027 --> 17:27.236
- Her doctor?
- Malucci.

17:27.444 --> 17:29.905
- I'll get him.
- Mix up dopamine.

17:30.072 --> 17:35.036
Get her on the gurney.
One, two, three.

17:35.661 --> 17:38.413
- Pressure's 85.
- Up dopamine to 12 mics.

17:38.663 --> 17:40.540
HemoCue's 14. 1.

17:44.043 --> 17:46.463
Right adnexa's normal.

17:46.713 --> 17:50.633
Left side, there's a mass
and free fluid. Damn it!

17:50.884 --> 17:54.053
- What is it?
- It's septic and hypotensive.

17:54.262 --> 17:57.473
- Should I page GYN?
- No. Dial 7614 for me.

17:57.682 --> 17:59.267
- Temp 102.
- It's the infection.

17:59.517 --> 18:00.602
Got them.

18:01.644 --> 18:05.772
It's Lockhart. I need to redline
a ruptured TOA.

18:06.023 --> 18:08.275
Page the chief resident.

18:08.483 --> 18:11.778
- What's going on?
- My patient's syncopal.

18:11.987 --> 18:14.072
- Dropped her pressure.
- Patient?

18:14.323 --> 18:16.867
- What patient?
- PID you discharged.

18:17.075 --> 18:18.952
- Pressure's 100.
- Let's move her.

18:19.161 --> 18:20.746
Maybe a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst?

18:20.954 --> 18:24.541
No, mass is loculated.
She spiked a fever.

18:26.168 --> 18:28.128
You got a loculated mass?

18:28.336 --> 18:31.380
I wouldn't know one if it
bit me on the ass.

18:41.307 --> 18:45.144
- You haven't gotten your antibiotics.
- No.

18:46.312 --> 18:49.440
- Sorry, I've been busy.
- I wrote the order 45 minutes ago.

18:49.648 --> 18:52.735
You wanted continuous albuterol
and steroids for him.

18:52.985 --> 18:54.902
- When can you do it?
- When I'm done.

18:55.111 --> 18:58.406
Forget it. I'll go get
your antibiotics.

19:01.242 --> 19:04.912
- When did you get back?
- 20 minutes ago. Still holding.

19:05.163 --> 19:08.499
- I'm so sorry about your dad.
- Thanks.

19:08.708 --> 19:12.628
Are you okay? I tried calling
a couple of times.

19:12.837 --> 19:16.090
Rachel came and we're
just hanging out.

19:17.842 --> 19:22.137
I'm trying to get my father
into a VA cemetery.

19:23.138 --> 19:27.350
- I'm transferred again.
- Didn't he want to be near your mom?

19:27.559 --> 19:30.964
I don't know.
He didn't want to be any trouble.

19:31.117 --> 19:33.926
- Suggested I put him out with the trash.
- That was helpful.

19:33.994 --> 19:37.902
Complained about mortuary vultures too.

19:37.911 --> 19:40.780
I got another recording telling me to hold.

19:40.947 --> 19:45.201
- You look beat.
- Tess hasn't been sleeping.

19:45.368 --> 19:47.536
- Teething probably.
- So Luka said.

19:47.953 --> 19:52.508
- He sees them enough to know.
- Don't give me a hard time about that.

19:52.516 --> 19:57.296
- I'm struggling enough with this as it is.
- I think It's great. I want you happy.

19:57.504 --> 20:01.967
Why do I still feel so unsure?

20:02.217 --> 20:05.887
Maybe you're just afraid of
making yourself vulnerable again.

20:07.264 --> 20:10.726
- She's waking up.
- Tell me if you need anything.

20:10.934 --> 20:11.976
Thanks.

20:12.810 --> 20:15.146
Connie, could you get Weaver for me?

20:15.396 --> 20:18.566
- Where am I?
- We're in the hospital, sweetheart.

20:18.774 --> 20:23.737
- No. No, I don't want that.
- Mrs. O'Brien.

20:23.904 --> 20:26.615
I'm Carol, a nurse.

20:26.824 --> 20:30.077
We're giving you fluids through an IV
because you stopped drinking.

20:30.244 --> 20:32.621
That's why you didn't wake up today.

20:32.871 --> 20:35.916
I want to go home. Please.

20:36.083 --> 20:40.003
Honey, we need to get you admitted
to the hospital so you can feel better.

20:40.211 --> 20:42.797
No. I want to go home.

20:45.550 --> 20:47.427
You want to go home?

20:48.803 --> 20:52.598
You don't want to be put onto
any machines?

20:52.765 --> 20:54.725
Please, no machines.

20:54.934 --> 20:58.396
They can help you if we stay.
They'll give you something for the pain.

20:58.604 --> 21:01.065
- Mr. O'Brien?
- Please, sweetheart.

21:03.608 --> 21:06.486
Please start a morphine drip.

21:07.112 --> 21:10.824
I think we should explore
home hospice care.

21:11.032 --> 21:14.494
An ambulance could take her home.
Can someone...

21:14.703 --> 21:19.249
...take care of pain medication?
It's clearly what she wants.

21:19.399 --> 21:21.292
She's dying.
She doesn't know what she wants.

21:21.501 --> 21:25.213
I think she does. She was very clear.

21:25.422 --> 21:28.842
Doesn't she deserve to die
where she wants to?

21:29.049 --> 21:31.802
With her family? In her own bed?

21:36.306 --> 21:37.349
Good.

21:38.642 --> 21:42.980
Why don't you tell her?
It'll help calm her down.

21:49.027 --> 21:53.365
I really didn't need this today.
Call Social Services.

21:53.573 --> 21:56.659
Maybe we should admit her.
Get her buffed-

21:56.867 --> 21:59.954
- Please.
- She'd go home eventually.

22:00.204 --> 22:05.167
She wants to go. We can't keep
her here. She wants to die.

22:05.376 --> 22:07.670
We have to respect her wishes.

22:07.878 --> 22:10.005
She's in excruciating pain.

22:10.214 --> 22:13.300
We didn't explain the options to her.

22:13.551 --> 22:15.970
Just call and set it up.

22:25.144 --> 22:27.188
All right.

22:27.563 --> 22:32.443
This'll take 20 minutes.
You should feel better in two days.

22:32.652 --> 22:35.363
A nurse will give you
your prescriptions.

22:35.571 --> 22:39.158
How do you feel?
Steroids and albuterol help?

22:39.367 --> 22:42.078
- I feel much better.
- Amazing stuff.

22:44.080 --> 22:46.206
You okay, Mrs. Wyatt?

22:46.373 --> 22:48.792
Hard to breathe...

22:49.000 --> 22:51.294
- Are you having chest pain?
- No.

22:51.503 --> 22:56.424
- This happen to you before?
- When I got Bactrim.

22:57.467 --> 23:02.097
- Bactrim?
- I told you I'm allergic to sulfa.

23:03.515 --> 23:04.808
Feeling dizzy...

23:09.354 --> 23:13.065
- Just lie down. Lie down.
- You need some help?

23:13.273 --> 23:17.069
No. Everything's under control.

23:17.236 --> 23:20.406
- How are you, Mrs. Wyatt?
- Not too good.

23:22.241 --> 23:24.118
- What happened?
- Nothing.

23:24.326 --> 23:27.246
- Somebody hit the call button.
- I did.

23:28.330 --> 23:30.916
- What?
- She could hardly breathe!

23:31.124 --> 23:34.294
- What happened?
- She complained of hives.

23:34.503 --> 23:37.505
- I gave her a subcu epi.
- Where's the blood from?

23:37.713 --> 23:40.424
- She must've pulled out her IV.
- Why would she?

23:40.633 --> 23:42.593
How would I know that?

23:47.765 --> 23:49.433
Start another line.

23:49.642 --> 23:53.270
Give her 50 of Benadryl,
125 of Solu-Medrol.

23:53.479 --> 23:55.439
You nodded off for a second.

23:57.108 --> 23:58.984
Good pulse and respirations.

23:59.318 --> 24:03.114
- Want any fluids?
- How about a liter over an hour?

24:23.466 --> 24:25.468
This won't be pretty.

24:29.262 --> 24:32.057
Why was a critical patient discharged?

24:32.224 --> 24:36.144
She wasn't critical then.
Her vitals were stable.

24:36.311 --> 24:38.897
- You didn't appreciate the mass?
- No.

24:39.147 --> 24:41.316
Who supervised? Dr. Malucci?

24:41.525 --> 24:45.362
- Didn't you appreciate anything?
- I didn't.

24:45.570 --> 24:48.990
What were you wearing? Oven mitts?

24:49.241 --> 24:53.703
Dr. Malucci never had a chance
to examine the patient.

24:53.912 --> 24:55.996
Get your stories straight.

24:56.205 --> 24:58.666
I never called him in.

24:58.874 --> 25:02.503
Have you recently graduated
from med school?

25:02.711 --> 25:06.840
I thought my OB/GYN experience
qualified me. I was wrong.

25:07.007 --> 25:10.094
So you discharged a patient...

25:10.302 --> 25:14.640
...examined and treated by a student?
She could've died!

25:14.890 --> 25:18.435
You're years from the experience
for these decisions.

25:18.644 --> 25:20.645
- I know.
- Oh, good!

25:25.191 --> 25:28.319
I'd like to speak with Dr. Malucci.

25:35.326 --> 25:36.827
Can I say something?

25:37.078 --> 25:40.748
Your cause is better served
by keeping your mouth shut.

25:48.046 --> 25:52.133
When Residents arrive here,
we size you up.

25:52.383 --> 25:56.346
We have great hopes for you.
We want you to succeed.

25:56.596 --> 26:00.517
Gradually, through interaction,
we form opinions.

26:01.518 --> 26:04.270
Do you want to know the staff's
opinion of you?

26:04.437 --> 26:09.400
You're lazy, sloppy. Your careless
attitude as a physician...

26:09.609 --> 26:13.779
...endangers patients' lives,
as witnessed today.

26:13.987 --> 26:17.908
None of us thinks
you're much of a doctor.

26:18.784 --> 26:23.246
Emotionally, he's depressed
one moment, elated the next.

26:23.455 --> 26:26.166
- Have you talked to him?
- I tried to ask him how he's doing.

26:26.374 --> 26:28.251
He's not forthcoming.

26:28.460 --> 26:32.798
- Is he seeing anyone?
- Let's get out of the hallway.

26:33.715 --> 26:36.301
Can you give us a minute?

26:38.052 --> 26:41.430
- A therapist? I don't know.
- Shouldn't he?

26:41.597 --> 26:46.435
- I'm not a psychiatrist.
- You think it's none of my business.

26:46.644 --> 26:49.104
- The DMS IV-
- You're a shrink?

26:49.313 --> 26:51.565
He has violent mood swings.

26:51.732 --> 26:54.693
He's deeply depressed or he's manic.

26:54.818 --> 26:59.656
- You're suggesting he's bipolar.
- Is there a family history?

26:59.865 --> 27:03.826
He was almost killed. He feels guilty
about Lucy's death.

27:04.035 --> 27:08.998
- I'd be moody too.
- But are you sure that's all it is?

27:09.415 --> 27:12.877
I may be wrong, but what if I'm right?

27:13.503 --> 27:18.466
If we care, don't we owe it to him
to try and find out?

27:21.219 --> 27:25.514
- How's she doing?
- Breathing's agonal. Resps are seven.

27:25.681 --> 27:30.644
- So she's not getting any better?
- I'm afraid not.

27:30.935 --> 27:32.763
We're trying to rehydrate her.

27:32.813 --> 27:38.193
and we called Social Services to help set up
the hospice care. Where are your daughters?

27:38.343 --> 27:42.197
Down in the cafeteria, getting
something to eat with some of the nurses.

27:42.247 --> 27:44.521
She's been sleeping so peacefully.

27:44.721 --> 27:46.555
You should have seen her two years ago.

27:46.611 --> 27:49.954
She was so beautiful. Alive and vibrant.

27:50.163 --> 27:53.875
Always laughing.
I wish I could have it back.

27:54.083 --> 27:56.501
The time I missed with her.

27:57.753 --> 28:02.090
Traveling for work,
late nights at the office.

28:02.299 --> 28:04.927
All the weekends I was
prepping for trial.

28:07.512 --> 28:10.015
And when she was first diagnosed...

28:11.592 --> 28:13.618
...I kept working.

28:15.270 --> 28:16.980
Can you believe that?

28:18.690 --> 28:21.817
Instead of spending time with her,
I kept working.

28:30.576 --> 28:34.330
I'm gonna call Social Services again.
See what's keeping them.

28:34.663 --> 28:35.706
Thanks.

28:38.751 --> 28:40.586
She's not breathing.

28:41.670 --> 28:44.256
- Oh, God!
- Shelagh?

28:44.498 --> 28:47.091
Please, the girls aren't here.

28:47.342 --> 28:50.678
I didn't think it would happen
this fast.

28:51.037 --> 28:53.222
- Connie, can you help me?
- She's a DNR.

28:53.431 --> 28:57.060
- We can stimulate her breathing.
- They didn't say goodbye.

28:57.268 --> 28:59.292
- I'll get Weaver.
- No, I want you to go and get Kovac.

28:59.321 --> 29:03.016
Tell him I need him,
then go downstairs and get the daughters.

29:03.424 --> 29:05.860
- Come on, Shelagh.
- Shelagh.

29:06.194 --> 29:09.739
- Come on.
- Please, God. Not yet. Please.

29:09.889 --> 29:12.240
- What happened?
- End-stage ovarian cancer.

29:12.249 --> 29:15.035
- She stopped breathing.
- Why are you baggin her. Let's intubate.

29:15.043 --> 29:18.663
- We can't. She's a DNR.
- Then let her go.

29:18.755 --> 29:22.108
Her daughters haven't
said goodbye yet.

29:22.175 --> 29:25.587
Please. I thought we had more time.

29:25.795 --> 29:27.756
Can we use a nasal trumpet?

29:28.114 --> 29:30.842
The children haven't had a chance
to say goodbye to her dying mother.

29:30.909 --> 29:34.020
It's not a ventilator. Please?

29:36.973 --> 29:39.266
- Where are the trumpets?
- I'll get it.

29:55.198 --> 29:56.366
I'm in.

30:10.880 --> 30:12.506
She's breathing.

30:13.758 --> 30:15.468
- What's going on?
- We put in a nasal trumpet.

30:15.676 --> 30:17.344
- She's DNR.
- We didn't intubate.

30:17.511 --> 30:21.390
- We're helping the airway-
- You resuscitated her.

30:21.599 --> 30:24.935
- She's your patient?
- Yes, she's my patient.

30:25.144 --> 30:27.897
Her daughters didn't say goodbye.

30:28.522 --> 30:31.149
Will you excuse us for a moment?

30:37.196 --> 30:41.367
- You violated a patient's wishes.
- I did what I thought best.

30:41.576 --> 30:44.203
- That's not your decision!
- I'm sorry.

30:44.370 --> 30:47.790
Damn right!
You're a senior staff member.

30:47.999 --> 30:53.296
We discussed this earlier. I told you
exactly what I wanted done!

30:53.504 --> 30:56.715
Respect my authority
or don't work here!

30:58.466 --> 31:02.554
If she codes again, neither of you
are to touch her.

31:02.721 --> 31:04.514
Is that clear?

31:07.517 --> 31:09.269
I'm sorry, Luka.

31:09.894 --> 31:11.980
Luka, don't just walk-

31:22.031 --> 31:25.909
You're here? I thought you'd be
upstairs all day.

31:26.118 --> 31:29.746
- I saw Kerry about Malucci.
- What did he do?

31:29.955 --> 31:31.748
I just discussed it.
Can I tell you later?

31:32.458 --> 31:35.627
- Sure.
- Get your dad sorted out?

31:37.921 --> 31:42.634
- Where is he now?
- Actually, in the trunk of my car.

31:44.177 --> 31:46.345
I had no time to go home.

31:47.805 --> 31:51.892
- Where's Rachel?
- With Jen's parents, being spoiled.

31:53.352 --> 31:55.396
You might like these back.

31:56.313 --> 31:58.691
I shouldn't keep them.

31:59.567 --> 32:03.487
- My father gave them to you.
- It was very sweet.

32:03.654 --> 32:06.991
But I just think it's a bad idea.

32:07.992 --> 32:13.204
Rachel should have them. I was
12 once. They'll mean a lot to her.

32:14.831 --> 32:17.709
Don't read too much into this.

32:18.668 --> 32:21.754
- Do I do that?
- You do it regularly.

32:22.547 --> 32:26.592
- An acute Ml is coming in.
I'll be right there.

32:28.678 --> 32:31.097
Are you still coming by tonight?

32:31.597 --> 32:34.559
- Where will Rachel sleep?
- In the living room.

32:34.892 --> 32:37.978
- I'm not off till 12.
- I'll leave the light on.

33:00.083 --> 33:03.085
- You put me in a bad position.
- I know.

33:03.294 --> 33:06.171
She's my superior.
I can't lose my job.

33:06.422 --> 33:08.048
You've every reason to be mad.

33:08.298 --> 33:11.635
- You took advantage of our relationship.
- I did what I thought was right.

33:11.844 --> 33:14.096
- Damn the consequences.
- In this case yes.

33:15.097 --> 33:19.977
You can make that decision for
yourself, but not for me.

33:22.146 --> 33:26.667
- You're really mad.
- Yes, I am! Why are you smiling?

33:27.568 --> 33:31.028
- I thought I was immune.
- Well, you're not!

33:35.658 --> 33:37.368
Luka, I'm sorry.

33:41.414 --> 33:45.751
- Really. It will never happen again.
- Good.

33:46.335 --> 33:48.921
- And thank you.
- For what?

33:49.588 --> 33:51.173
For helping her.

33:52.174 --> 33:53.592
You're welcome.

34:11.693 --> 34:12.860
What?

34:14.904 --> 34:16.197
Nothing.

34:18.741 --> 34:21.326
- You sure?
- Yeah.

34:30.793 --> 34:34.422
"Good night, little house, and
good night, mouse.

34:34.589 --> 34:37.759
Good night, comb. Good night, brush. "

34:37.967 --> 34:40.679
- Now can you see the mouse?
- There's the mouse.

34:41.012 --> 34:44.306
Guys, your mom's ready to see you now.

34:45.933 --> 34:48.310
Could you take Jennifer?

34:48.518 --> 34:50.688
Sure. We'll be in in a minute.

34:55.609 --> 34:57.736
Don't you want to see your mom?

35:00.698 --> 35:03.575
She's going to die, isn't she?

35:09.998 --> 35:12.041
It's not fair.

35:14.585 --> 35:16.295
No, it's not.

35:19.882 --> 35:22.760
I don't want to only have a dad.

35:23.678 --> 35:28.516
I want to be a family,
like we used to be.

35:35.564 --> 35:37.190
Come on. We should go.

35:57.627 --> 35:59.087
You ready?

36:09.805 --> 36:11.515
Hi, Mommy.

36:14.101 --> 36:16.103
Hi, there.

36:17.688 --> 36:19.648
How's my girl?

36:35.788 --> 36:37.206
What are you doing?

36:39.708 --> 36:41.544
Gathering my thoughts.

36:41.752 --> 36:46.298
- You've been in here a while?
- I finished some sutures.

36:46.507 --> 36:49.510
I'm hanging out. Is that a problem?

36:49.635 --> 36:54.472
No. Some of us are just
worried about you.

36:55.515 --> 36:57.475
You don't need to be.

36:58.726 --> 37:00.353
How are you?

37:02.522 --> 37:04.816
Seeing anybody? A therapist?

37:11.405 --> 37:14.116
- Need a referral?
- Sure.

37:15.785 --> 37:19.038
Nadio gave me some names.

37:19.330 --> 37:20.914
That'd be great.

37:21.798 --> 37:25.293
- It might help.
- Yeah, you're right. I'll go.

37:54.204 --> 37:56.881
Did Social Services get your patient home?

37:57.172 --> 37:59.243
No. She died.

38:00.152 --> 38:03.976
- I'm sorry.
- She was end-stage.

38:06.041 --> 38:10.045
- Would you like to get some dinner?
- Sure.

38:11.362 --> 38:13.297
We don't have to.

38:14.965 --> 38:16.759
That would be nice.

38:17.009 --> 38:18.469
Miss Hathaway?

38:19.303 --> 38:21.347
I'll find you when I'm off.

38:27.353 --> 38:31.398
I just want to thank you for everything
you did for us today.

38:31.607 --> 38:33.150
You're welcome.

38:37.654 --> 38:40.031
Do you believe that we
have soul mates?

38:41.324 --> 38:43.184
That there's only...

38:44.252 --> 38:47.121
...one person we're supposed to find?

38:47.622 --> 38:50.792
Only one person we can really love?

38:52.944 --> 38:54.796
I didn't used to.

38:56.297 --> 38:58.132
But I do now.

38:59.133 --> 39:02.553
She was the love of my life.

39:03.094 --> 39:06.473
I'll never love anyone
the way I loved her.

39:35.292 --> 39:37.419
I need some more atropine.

39:39.213 --> 39:41.840
- Where's Mark?
- Everything all right?

39:42.049 --> 39:44.718
- Where's Mark?
- Exam 1.

39:48.513 --> 39:52.392
I got to go. Tell Kerry
I won't be in tomorrow.

39:52.559 --> 39:54.310
- Twins okay?
- I'll drop them at my mom's.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.354
- What?
- I'll call you from the plane.

39:56.562 --> 39:57.730
Plane?

39:58.939 --> 40:01.567
- Where's Kovac?
- Curtain 3.

40:04.904 --> 40:08.741
- I can't have dinner with you tonight.
- Okay.

40:10.868 --> 40:12.286
I'm so sorry.

40:13.871 --> 40:15.039
For what?

40:18.209 --> 40:19.834
I have to find out.

40:21.753 --> 40:22.837
Find out what?

40:24.297 --> 40:26.507
If he's still in love with me.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.844
Because...

40:30.094 --> 40:32.889
I'm still in love with him.
I am.

40:33.056 --> 40:36.601
I've been in love with him
since I was 23.

40:38.603 --> 40:43.066
He's everything to me. He's my life.

40:43.232 --> 40:47.527
I'm complete when I'm with him.
I'm empty when we're apart.

40:51.823 --> 40:54.576
He's the father of my children.

40:57.078 --> 40:59.206
And he's my soul mate.

41:01.458 --> 41:05.879
You'll find someone. You will.
You're a wonderful man.

41:06.254 --> 41:10.300
Someone who'll love you
the way your wife loved you.

41:15.679 --> 41:18.015
You'll find her. You will.

41:23.771 --> 41:25.606
You will find her.

41:46.500 --> 41:47.835
Seattle? Seattle?

41:47.960 --> 41:51.714
Ramp four. Hurry!
They're in final boarding.

42:05.059 --> 42:06.227
Seattle?

42:06.436 --> 42:08.938
All right. Have a good flight.

42:19.908 --> 42:22.160
Fasten your seat belt.

42:25.538 --> 42:27.290
You almost missed it.

42:29.624 --> 42:31.293
Yeah. I almost did.

42:35.547 --> 42:36.965
Dad, you're crazy.

42:37.174 --> 42:41.553
This is your grandfather's favorite
spot in Chicago.

42:41.762 --> 42:43.305
Right here.

42:43.972 --> 42:45.724
It's beautiful.

42:48.101 --> 42:52.522
I have to go to San Diego next week
to bury his ashes...

42:52.772 --> 42:56.734
...next to your grandmother's.
Can you come with me?

42:56.942 --> 43:00.362
Sure. I'd like that.

43:04.825 --> 43:09.079
- You miss him, huh?
- Yeah. I do.

43:10.956 --> 43:12.541
It's kind of funny.

43:13.250 --> 43:14.334
Why?

43:16.462 --> 43:20.506
We didn't like each other much
for a long time.

43:21.591 --> 43:22.633
How come?

43:25.303 --> 43:27.138
I can't remember now.

43:29.015 --> 43:31.225
Probably mostly my fault.

43:32.435 --> 43:34.437
I have something for you.

43:35.104 --> 43:38.065
These were your grandmother's.

43:40.609 --> 43:43.112
- Like them?
- They're beautiful.

43:43.321 --> 43:46.156
Can I put them on you?
Turn around.

43:57.125 --> 43:59.711
You look lovely.

44:00.795 --> 44:02.380
Thank you.

44:04.591 --> 44:07.802
Promise me you won't grow up
too fast, okay?

45:32.449 --> 45:35.802
- Where are the girls?
- With my mom.

45:41.057 --> 45:42.976
It's beautiful here.
