WEBVTT

00:03.470 --> 00:04.671
- PREVIOUSLY ON<i>MILLION DOLLAR</i>
<i>LISTING NEW YORK...</i>

00:04.704 --> 00:06.373
- FREDRIK, YOU'RE REALLY
DISAPPOINTING ME.

00:06.406 --> 00:08.241
YOU'VE BROKEN RECORDS BEFORE.
- THIS IS LIKE A TWILIGHT ZONE.

00:08.274 --> 00:09.776
THIS IS A RECORD.

00:09.809 --> 00:11.144
- 8.8, BEST AND FINAL.

00:11.177 --> 00:12.278
- THANK YOU, BUDDY.

00:12.312 --> 00:14.180
- YOU CAN HAVE IT
UNDER ONE CONDITION--

00:14.214 --> 00:16.783
TODD SHOULD BE PART
OF THE LISTING.

00:16.816 --> 00:18.618
- THE LAST THING I NEED IS
TO PARTNER UP WITH SOMEONE

00:18.651 --> 00:20.053
THAT IS GONNA HOLD ME BACK.

00:20.086 --> 00:22.489
- YOU KNOW, I CAN'T HANDLE
THIS LISTING ALL BY MYSELF.

00:22.522 --> 00:23.490
- SO WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK
TO DO.

00:23.523 --> 00:24.657
- [laughs]

00:24.691 --> 00:27.861
- THE SKY GARAGE APARTMENT IS
THE CROWN JEWEL.

00:27.894 --> 00:30.430
MR. WOO WON'T TAKE ANYTHING LESS
THAN 23 MILLION.

00:30.463 --> 00:32.799
- 23 MILLION?
THAT'S INSANE.

00:32.832 --> 00:34.868
- I'VE GOT
THIS PENTHOUSE APARTMENT,

00:34.901 --> 00:36.269
AND I'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE
THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS ABOUT IT.

00:36.302 --> 00:37.537
SO I WANT TO MAKE A VIDEO,

00:37.570 --> 00:39.706
BUT SINCE THE APARTMENT
ISN'T FINISHED YET,

00:39.739 --> 00:41.307
WE HAVE ABOUT FOUR MORE WEEKS
OF CONSTRUCTION.

00:41.341 --> 00:43.643
- I'M COMPLETELY [bleep].

00:43.677 --> 00:46.846
[upbeat music]

00:46.880 --> 00:48.348
- MY MOTTO IS EXPANSION...

00:48.381 --> 00:52.218
ALWAYS IN ALL WAYS.

00:52.252 --> 00:55.288
- NEW YORK CITY, IT'S THE MOST
EXCITING CITY FOR REAL ESTATE,

00:55.321 --> 00:57.123
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

00:57.157 --> 00:59.659
- I'M THE CLOSER
AND A LISTING MACHINE.

00:59.693 --> 01:02.362
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER IS THAT
I WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

01:02.395 --> 01:03.697
- THIS IS THE SECOND TIME
YOU'VE DISRESPECTED ME, BRO.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.131
- HAVE I MET YOU BEFORE?

01:05.165 --> 01:07.534
- I WANTED THIS THING MORE THAN
ANYBODY ELSE, AND YOU KNEW IT!

01:07.567 --> 01:08.802
- IT'S OVER!

01:08.835 --> 01:12.839
* *

01:18.878 --> 01:20.480
- IT'S VERY, VERY FRUSTRATING

01:20.513 --> 01:21.815
THAT CONSTRUCTION
HAS BEEN DELAYED

01:21.848 --> 01:23.216
ON MY SKY GARAGE LISTING.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.417
- THE CONSTRUCTION SITE--
IT'S A LITTLE BIT SLOWER

01:24.451 --> 01:26.386
THAN WE HAD HOPED FOR.
- YEAH, I CAN TELL.

01:26.419 --> 01:28.154
- I CAN'T START THE COMMERCIAL
THAT I WANT TO DO,

01:28.188 --> 01:29.756
CAN'T START
ANY OF THE MARKETING

01:29.789 --> 01:32.292
BECAUSE MOST BUYERS JUST DON'T
HAVE THAT IMAGINATION.

01:32.325 --> 01:33.626
I DON'T QUITE GET THIS.

01:33.660 --> 01:35.095
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE,
I KNOW,

01:35.095 --> 01:37.297
BECAUSE IT'S NEVER BEEN
DONE BEFORE.

01:37.330 --> 01:38.498
- SO I'M GONNA START
THE COMMERCIAL

01:38.531 --> 01:39.966
ONCE THAT THING IS
COMPLETELY BUILT.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.001
- YEAH.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.535
- BUT BUSINESS
HAS BEEN PILING ON,

01:42.569 --> 01:45.572
SO IN THE MEANTIME, I'M GONNA
MOVE ON TO MY OTHER LISTINGS.

01:49.009 --> 01:50.543
ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE DONE

01:50.577 --> 01:52.979
SINCE MY BUSINESS
HAS JUST BOOMED

01:53.013 --> 01:55.448
IS BUILD A TEAM OF BROKERS
UNDERNEATH IT.

01:55.482 --> 01:57.851
YURI, LET'S GO
TO 26TH AND 5TH.

01:57.884 --> 01:59.019
SOMETIMES THE AGENTS
ON MY TEAM

01:59.119 --> 02:00.520
NEED ME TO HOLD THEIR HANDS
A LITTLE BIT.

02:00.553 --> 02:02.555
BUT THAT'S OKAY
BECAUSE EVERY SALE THEY MAKE

02:02.589 --> 02:03.790
IS A SALE I MAKE.

02:03.823 --> 02:06.159
AND LINDA'S HAD A LITTLE BIT
OF A HARD TIME

02:06.192 --> 02:08.595
GETTING THE SELLER TO AGREE
ON A REASONABLE PRICE.

02:08.628 --> 02:09.863
SO AS THE TEAM LEADER,

02:09.896 --> 02:11.464
I GOTTA SWOOP IN
AND SHOW HER

02:11.498 --> 02:13.900
HOW YOU WOO A SELLER.

02:13.933 --> 02:16.536
SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY
THAT'S MY SPECIALTY.

02:16.569 --> 02:20.640
"NOMAD" STANDS FOR
"NORTH OF MADISON SQUARE PARK."

02:20.674 --> 02:22.142
AND IT'S A QUIRKY,
NEW NEIGHBORHOOD

02:22.175 --> 02:23.877
KNOWN FOR ITS GREAT RESTAURANTS,

02:23.910 --> 02:26.780
AND PEOPLE LOVE IT FOR ALL
OF THE OLD ARCHITECTURE IT HAS.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.115
[doorbell chimes]

02:29.149 --> 02:30.450
- HEY, ANGELA.
- HI.

02:30.483 --> 02:31.551
- HI.
- THIS IS RYAN.

02:31.584 --> 02:32.552
- HI. ANGELA.
- I'M RYAN. HOW ARE YOU?

02:32.585 --> 02:34.954
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- UH, OKAY.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.690
COOL SPACE.
- THANK YOU.

02:36.723 --> 02:38.625
- IT'S, UM, SUPER EMPTY.

02:38.658 --> 02:41.327
- YEAH, I JUST MOVED
A COUPLE MONTHS AGO.

02:41.361 --> 02:42.996
- WHERE'D YOU MOVE?
- TO L.A.

02:43.096 --> 02:44.130
I'M STARTING SCHOOL THERE,
SO...

02:44.164 --> 02:45.465
- AH, I WAS GONNA SAY...
- YES.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.300
- I DIDN'T SEE
AN ENGAGEMENT RING OR ANYTHING.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.736
- IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS,
BUT YES.

02:49.769 --> 02:51.271
[laughs]
- RIGHT.

02:51.304 --> 02:52.272
- RIGHT.
- COOL.

02:52.305 --> 02:53.273
MAYBE YOU WANT
TO SHOW US AROUND?

02:53.306 --> 02:55.642
- UM, SURE.

03:00.313 --> 03:02.549
- SO HOW DID YOU DEAL WITH
WHEN PEOPLE WOULD COME IN

03:02.582 --> 03:04.951
AND YOU HAD THIS,
LIKE, MASSIVE POLE?

03:05.051 --> 03:07.654
- NO ONE ACTUALLY DID THAT,
SO YOU'LL BE THE FIRST.

03:16.329 --> 03:17.831
IS THAT A STAMP FROM A CLUB
ON YOUR WRIST?

03:17.864 --> 03:18.832
- IT IS.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.967
- DO YOU LIKE TO PARTY?
- YES.

03:21.067 --> 03:22.435
- OH, BUT NOW YOU LIVE
IN CALIFORNIA.

03:22.469 --> 03:23.970
- NOW I LIVE IN CALIFORNIA.
- WE'RE ACTUALLY MAYBE THINKING

03:24.070 --> 03:25.338
ABOUT OPENING AN OFFICE
OUT THERE.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.840
WHICH IS COOL,
SO MAYBE WE COULD HANG OUT

03:26.873 --> 03:28.775
AFTER WE SELL THIS.

03:28.808 --> 03:30.477
- WE'LL SEE
IF YOU CAN SELL IT.

03:30.510 --> 03:33.113
- THIS IS, LIKE,
THE LAST TIME I TRIED TO WOO

03:33.146 --> 03:34.481
A SABER-TOOTHED TIGER--

03:34.514 --> 03:36.983
IT DIDN'T WORK.

03:37.083 --> 03:38.284
DO YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THE PRICE?

03:38.318 --> 03:40.687
- LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PRICE.
- ALL RIGHT.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.489
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SPACE.

03:42.522 --> 03:43.990
YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING--
IT FLOWS REALLY WELL.

03:44.090 --> 03:46.626
IT'S GOT HIGH CEILINGS,
BUT IT'S BIG, AND IT'S EMPTY.

03:46.659 --> 03:48.962
AND THE VIEWS
AREN'T THE BEST.

03:48.995 --> 03:51.264
SO WHAT WERE YOU
THINKING ABOUT FOR PRICE?

03:51.297 --> 03:53.366
- UM, I WAS THINKING
OF MAYBE 3.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.601
AROUND THERE.

03:54.634 --> 03:57.270
- 3?
- YES.

03:57.303 --> 03:58.705
- 3 IS WAY TOO HIGH.

03:58.738 --> 04:01.775
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
FILL IT WITH $100 BILLS,

04:01.808 --> 04:03.176
IT'S NOT GOING TO SELL.

04:03.209 --> 04:06.046
THE BUILDING, AVERAGE PRICE
PER SQUARE FOOT IS WHAT?

04:06.046 --> 04:07.380
- 1,800.
- OKAY.

04:07.414 --> 04:08.882
AND THE AVERAGE PRICE
PER SQUARE FOOT NOW

04:08.915 --> 04:10.250
FOR NEW PRODUCT
IN THE AREA IS WHAT?

04:10.283 --> 04:11.785
- 2,000 AND UP.

04:11.818 --> 04:13.620
- OKAY.
MAYBE WE MEET IN THE MIDDLE.

04:13.653 --> 04:15.355
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- AROUND 2.6.

04:15.388 --> 04:18.058
IT'S A LITTLE OVER 1,900,
SQUARE FOOT.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.793
- BUT EVEN THOUGH
I'VE BEEN HERE A FEW YEARS,

04:19.826 --> 04:22.062
I'VE KEPT IT ALMOST
IN BRAND-NEW CONDITION.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.063
- UH-HUH.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.064
- THIS BUILDING'S
IN A GREAT AREA.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.365
IT'S, LIKE, UP AND COMING.

04:25.398 --> 04:28.835
SO MY NUMBER IS 3,
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S FAIR.

04:28.868 --> 04:31.805
- THAT'S SO FAR
OVER 2,000 PER SQUARE FOOT.

04:31.838 --> 04:32.806
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

04:32.839 --> 04:34.441
WITH 3 MILLION,
WE'RE GONNA SIT,

04:34.474 --> 04:36.643
WE'RE GONNA REDUCE
TO 2.75.

04:36.676 --> 04:38.278
THEN WE'RE GONNA REDUCE
TO 2.65.

04:38.311 --> 04:40.714
THEN WE'RE GONNA REDUCE
TO 2.495.

04:40.747 --> 04:41.881
RIGHT?
- RIGHT.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.917
- SO THERE'S ONLY THREE THINGS
I KNOW.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.886
ONE IS THAT 2.6
IS THE RIGHT NUMBER

04:46.920 --> 04:48.388
FOR THIS APARTMENT.

04:48.421 --> 04:50.590
TWO IS THAT I'M VERY GOOD
AT WHAT I DO,

04:50.623 --> 04:54.094
AND THREE,
YOU ARE DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.596
AH!
WAS THAT A SMILE I JUST SAW?

04:56.629 --> 04:59.866
[singsong] THE CHARMINATOR
JUST BROKE THROUGH.

04:59.899 --> 05:02.035
IF YOU AGREE WITH
THOSE THREE THINGS LIKE I DO,

05:02.068 --> 05:05.939
I THINK WE HAVE A DEAL.

05:06.039 --> 05:09.042
- SO 2.6.
UM....

05:09.075 --> 05:11.678
- IF THAT'S THE NUMBER
THAT WE'RE GONNA GO WITH,

05:11.711 --> 05:13.613
THEN THAT'S WHAT I WANT,

05:13.646 --> 05:16.216
AND I DON'T WANT
ANY NEGOTIATION--THAT'S IT.

05:16.249 --> 05:17.217
- NEVER SAY NEVER,
BUT OKAY.

05:17.250 --> 05:18.218
- OKAY.

05:18.251 --> 05:20.720
- COOL, 2.6.
- 2.6.

05:20.754 --> 05:21.755
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS.
- ALL RIGHT.

05:21.788 --> 05:23.823
- DO IT.
- WE HAVE OUR WORK TO DO.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.529
- OKAY.

05:29.562 --> 05:30.697
COME HERE.
ALL RIGHT.

05:30.730 --> 05:33.066
SO TODAY
IS A VERY IMPORTANT DAY.

05:33.066 --> 05:34.567
MY CURRENT LISTING
AT CENTRAL PARK WEST

05:34.601 --> 05:37.704
HAS BEEN A HELL OF A WORKOUT.

05:37.737 --> 05:39.506
WHEN I GOT THIS LISTING
AT 6 MILLION...

05:39.539 --> 05:42.442
- YOU CAN HAVE IT
AT 6 UNDER CONDITION.

05:42.475 --> 05:43.677
- I ALSO LEARNED
THAT I HAD TO MENTOR

05:43.710 --> 05:45.979
THE SELLER'S SON, TODD,
WHO HAD THE APARTMENT

05:46.079 --> 05:47.881
ON THE MARKET BEFORE,
BUT COULDN'T SELL IT.

05:47.914 --> 05:50.183
AND WHEN IT CAME DOWN
TO BUSINESS,

05:50.216 --> 05:51.718
I REALIZED
HOW FAR WE HAVE TO GO.

05:51.751 --> 05:55.121
- MR. ATKINS,
I'D LIKE TO INFORM YOU OF--

05:56.423 --> 05:57.390
[dial tone]

05:57.424 --> 06:00.293
- HE STILL HAS A LONG WAY
TO GO,

06:00.326 --> 06:02.262
BUT IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS.

06:02.295 --> 06:03.363
IF I WANT
TO KEEP THIS LISTING,

06:03.396 --> 06:04.464
I GOTTA MAKE SURE
THAT HE LEARNS QUICK

06:04.497 --> 06:05.765
SO THAT WE CAN GET
THIS APARTMENT SOLD.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.634
ALL RIGHT, SO TODAY,
I WANT TO COME UP WITH AN IDEA

06:07.667 --> 06:09.302
FOR A VERY AMAZING
OPEN HOUSE.

06:09.336 --> 06:14.074
- WE CAN MAKE, YOU KNOW, LIKE,
A JAMAICAN FRUIT PUNCH.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.543
- A JAMAICAN FRUIT PUNCH?
- YES, YES, YES.

06:16.576 --> 06:18.645
WE GIVE THEM
THE JAMAICAN RUM AND--

06:18.678 --> 06:19.779
- LISTEN, I USED
TO GET PEOPLE DRUNK

06:19.813 --> 06:21.047
ON OPEN HOUSES
LIKE IT WAS MY JOB.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.682
I LEARNED THAT
THAT'S NOT THE BEST WAY

06:22.716 --> 06:25.051
TO ACTUALLY GET PEOPLE
INTERESTED IN AN APARTMENT.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.120
- OH, YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:27.153 --> 06:29.289
- WHAT IF WE DO,
LIKE, A TEA PARTY?

06:29.322 --> 06:31.124
A VERY SOPHISTICATED AFTERNOON

06:31.157 --> 06:34.427
WHERE PEOPLE JUST COME
AND ENJOY GOOD TEA.

06:34.461 --> 06:36.062
- YEAH. YEAH.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.164
I THINK MY MOM MIGHT BE
A TEA DRINKER.

06:38.198 --> 06:42.969
- BUT YOU KNOW
YOUR MOTHER CANNOT COME.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.804
- MY MOTHER WAS SO EXCITED
ABOUT COMING.

06:44.838 --> 06:47.374
- WELL, UM,

06:47.407 --> 06:51.411
IT'S NOT GOOD TO HAVE ANY SELLER
IN THE OPEN HOUSES.

06:51.444 --> 06:52.879
- OKAY.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.114
- A VERY IMPORTANT RULE
FOR A SUCCESSFUL OPEN HOUSE

06:54.147 --> 06:55.715
IS TO NEVER HAVE THE SELLER
IN THERE

06:55.749 --> 06:56.816
BECAUSE THEY'RE
VERY EMOTIONALLY ATTACHED

06:56.850 --> 06:58.351
TO THE PROPERTY.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.787
SO WE CAN MAKE SURE
THAT SHE DOESN'T GO, RIGHT?

07:00.820 --> 07:03.690
- OKAY.
- CAN YOU CALL HER AND TELL HER?

07:03.723 --> 07:05.325
- YOU WANT ME TO CALL HER?
- YES.

07:05.358 --> 07:07.460
CAN YOU DO THAT?

07:07.494 --> 07:08.728
- WELL, IT'S BETTER YOU CALL.

07:08.762 --> 07:11.564
- I WANT YOU TO CALL HER.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.433
- OKAY.
- OKAY, LET'S CALL YOUR MOTHER.

07:13.466 --> 07:15.068
- [laughs]

07:15.101 --> 07:17.270
YOU SORT OF CAUGHT ME
OFF GUARD.

07:17.303 --> 07:19.172
- GIVE IT TO HER STRAIGHT.

07:19.205 --> 07:21.574
[line trills]

07:21.608 --> 07:24.310
MYRA.

07:24.344 --> 07:27.280
I AM VERY WELL.
I AM GOOD.

07:27.313 --> 07:28.515
I'M ACTUALLY HERE WITH TODD--
WE'RE BRAINSTORMING

07:28.548 --> 07:31.184
ON OUR FIRST OPEN HOUSE
FOR THE PROPERTY.

07:31.217 --> 07:33.486
WE THINK--

07:33.520 --> 07:36.056
WELL, UH--

07:36.056 --> 07:40.093
- WELL, IF I CAN JUST GET
TO THE POINT, THOUGH,

07:40.126 --> 07:42.195
I KNOW
IT COULD BE FUN, THOUGH,

07:42.228 --> 07:43.763
BUT IT'S PROBABLY BEST
THAT YOU DON'T

07:43.797 --> 07:45.765
JUST BECAUSE, UM,

07:45.799 --> 07:49.069
LUIS IS BRINGING TO MY ATTENTION
THAT IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOOD

07:49.069 --> 07:53.573
FOR YOU TO INTERMINGLE WITH
THESE PEOPLE AND STUFF, THOUGH.

07:56.743 --> 07:59.212
WELL--

08:03.783 --> 08:06.019
NO, NO, BUT--BUT LISTEN.

08:06.052 --> 08:07.153
I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO GET OFFENDED.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.456
LUIS FELT
THAT IT WOULD BE BEST

08:09.489 --> 08:14.027
THAT WE CALL YOU UP
AND TELL YOU THIS, THOUGH.

08:14.060 --> 08:15.061
- IT'S ACTUALLY FUNNY THAT TODD
KEEPS ON THROWING ME

08:15.095 --> 08:16.363
UNDER THE BUS.

08:16.396 --> 08:19.399
BUT HEY, AT THIS POINT,
I'LL TAKE WHAT I CAN GET.

08:19.432 --> 08:21.735
- I MEAN, I'LL TELL YOU
ABOUT IT.

08:21.768 --> 08:25.038
PERHAPS I'LL BRING YOU BACK
A FEW COOKIES IF I CAN.

08:32.045 --> 08:35.348
- ABSOLUTELY.

08:35.382 --> 08:36.616
GOOD JOB.

08:36.649 --> 08:38.518
WELL, NOW WE JUST
GOTTA SELL IT.

08:38.551 --> 08:39.919
- AND THEN WE DRINK LIQUOR.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.087
- AND THEN WE DRINK LIQUOR
LIKE GENTLEMEN.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.289
YES. ABSOLUTELY.
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

08:47.327 --> 08:50.630
- FERNANDO, CAN YOU TAKE ME
TO 16 WARREN?

08:50.663 --> 08:52.232
NORTHEAST TRIBECA.

08:52.265 --> 08:54.267
THE WORD "TRIBECA"
ACTUALLY STANDS

08:54.300 --> 08:57.270
FOR THE "TRIANGLE
BELOW CANAL STREET."

08:57.303 --> 08:59.072
IT HAS LOTS OF PARKS,

08:59.105 --> 09:00.907
COBBLESTONE STREETS--
BEAUTIFUL.

09:01.007 --> 09:03.276
I HAVE A LISTING PITCH.
IT'S GONNA BE A CHALLENGING ONE.

09:03.309 --> 09:05.011
THIS PENTHOUSE HAS BEEN
ON AND OFF THE MARKET

09:05.011 --> 09:06.746
FOR OVER FOUR YEARS.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.448
NO ONE'S BEEN ABLE TO SELL IT.

09:08.481 --> 09:10.016
BUT WHEN ARE PEOPLE
ACTUALLY GOING TO LEARN

09:10.016 --> 09:12.819
TO CALL FREDRIK EKLUND FIRST?

09:12.852 --> 09:14.187
[elevator bell dings]

09:14.220 --> 09:15.622
HELLO?
OH, HI.

09:15.655 --> 09:16.856
- HEY, FREDRIK.
- HI, JOEL.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.025
JOEL AND HIS WIFE
DEVELOPED THE BUILDING.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.027
AND THE OTHER UNITS SOLD
A LONG TIME AGO

09:21.061 --> 09:23.096
WHEN THE BUILDING FIRST CAME
ON THE MARKET.

09:23.129 --> 09:26.199
AND THIS PENTHOUSE IS
THE LAST AVAILABLE UNIT TO SELL.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.934
THIS IS VIBEKE.

09:28.034 --> 09:29.235
ARE YOU<i>SVENSK?</i>

09:29.269 --> 09:30.337
SWEDISH?
-<i>DANSK.</i>

09:30.370 --> 09:31.871
-<i>DANSK!</i>
- YEAH.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.840
- [singing in foreign language]

09:33.873 --> 09:35.041
[laughter]

09:35.075 --> 09:36.876
- I'LL LET YOU DO THAT.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.345
I THINK THE PRICE
JUST WENT UP.

09:38.378 --> 09:39.746
[laughter]

09:39.779 --> 09:41.648
SO, GUYS,
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

09:41.681 --> 09:44.250
SHOW ME AROUND.
I'M EXCITED TO SEE THIS.

09:46.052 --> 09:48.788
JOEL SPENT A LOT OF MONEY
DEVELOPING THIS BUILDING,

09:48.822 --> 09:50.056
AND IT REALLY SHOWS.

09:50.056 --> 09:51.324
THE APARTMENT IS STUNNING

09:51.358 --> 09:52.759
WITH FLOOR-TO-CEILING GLASS,

09:52.792 --> 09:55.261
THREE TERRACES,
AND FOUR FLOORS.

09:55.295 --> 09:56.930
AND IT'S GREEN.

09:56.963 --> 09:59.566
- WE ARE GOING TO GO UPSTAIRS
TO THE MASTER BEDROOM.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.101
- BUT THE MONTHLIES--
THEY'RE OUTRAGEOUS.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.370
THEY'RE $9,000 A MONTH.

10:03.403 --> 10:04.371
THAT'S A LOT.

10:04.404 --> 10:07.607
$9,000 PAYS COMMON CHARGES,

10:07.640 --> 10:08.708
WHICH TAKES CARE
OF THE BUILDING--

10:08.742 --> 10:10.276
THE SOLAR PANELS,
CLEANING THOSE WINDOWS,

10:10.310 --> 10:11.845
PAYING THE SUPER,
ET CETERA.

10:11.878 --> 10:13.480
I LOVE THIS ROOM.

10:13.513 --> 10:14.481
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
A FRONT OF A SHIP.

10:14.514 --> 10:15.849
BUT THE REALLY HIGH MONTHLIES

10:15.882 --> 10:18.651
DOESN'T REALLY GIVE YOU
WHAT OTHER BUILDINGS WOULD--

10:18.685 --> 10:20.553
DOORMEN, SWIMMING POOL, PARKING.

10:20.587 --> 10:22.355
AND IT'S PROBABLY
ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS

10:22.389 --> 10:23.757
WHY JOEL HASN'T
BEEN ABLE TO SELL

10:23.790 --> 10:25.091
THE APARTMENT
THE LAST FEW YEARS.

10:25.125 --> 10:29.729
- THE MOST BEAUTIFUL VIEW
IN MANHATTAN.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.631
- ISN'T THIS AMAZING?
- OH, MY GOD.

10:31.664 --> 10:33.800
- AND SOLAR PANELS
RIGHT UP THERE.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.802
SO THE ELECTRICITY BILL
IS BASICALLY ZERO.

10:35.835 --> 10:38.905
- WOW.

10:38.938 --> 10:40.407
IT'S A VERY UNIQUE PENTHOUSE.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.409
WHAT IS YOUR EXPECTATIONS
ON PRICE?

10:42.442 --> 10:45.311
- WELL, I MEAN, WHAT DO
YOU THINK WE SHOULD GET?

10:45.345 --> 10:47.647
- WE'RE IN THIS PART
OF TRIBECA,

10:47.681 --> 10:51.284
WHICH IS GOOD,
BUT NOT PRIME TRIBECA.

10:51.317 --> 10:54.821
I WOULD DEFINITELY WANT
TO BE BELOW 2,000 A FOOT.

10:54.854 --> 10:59.626
I WOULD LIKE TO BE MAYBE,
5,750,000.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.062
- I MEAN, LISTEN,
EVERYBODY'S SELLING APARTMENTS

11:02.062 --> 11:03.296
LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.766
REALISTICALLY,
I THINK WE COULD AGREE

11:06.800 --> 11:08.601
TO, LIKE, 6.5.

11:08.635 --> 11:11.938
- BUT, JOEL, THE MONTHLIES
BEING $9,000 A MONTH

11:11.971 --> 11:13.606
WITH NO DOORMAN?

11:13.640 --> 11:15.342
IT'S NOT HIGHLY AMENITIZED.

11:15.375 --> 11:16.810
IT DOESN'T HAVE THE BELLS
AND THE WHISTLES

11:16.843 --> 11:18.812
AND PRIVATE PARKING LIKE
SOME OF THESE OTHER BUILDINGS

11:18.845 --> 11:20.080
WE'RE GONNA BE COMPETING WITH.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.314
I DON'T WANT TO GO
A DOLLAR OVER 6.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.515
I'M SORRY.

11:22.549 --> 11:24.217
THEN I'M NOT
THE RIGHT PERSON FOR YOU.

11:24.250 --> 11:25.819
- LET'S SPLIT IT, OKAY?

11:25.852 --> 11:28.922
- LET'S SPLIT IT?
- YEAH, 6,250,000.

11:28.955 --> 11:30.090
- NO.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.092
I'M GOING TO BE VERY FIRM
WITH YOU.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.527
6, AND I'M TELLING YOU,

11:34.561 --> 11:35.895
YOU SHOULD BE VERY HAPPY

11:35.929 --> 11:40.633
IF I CAN GET 6.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.702
- OKAY.

11:42.736 --> 11:45.505
WE'LL AGREE TO 6 MILLION...
- AGREE.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.541
- BUT WITH THE PROMISE
THAT YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS

11:48.575 --> 11:50.844
REAL FAST.
- 6 MILLION.

11:50.877 --> 11:51.911
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE EXCITED.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.413
AND YOU AND I
ARE GONNA BE DANCING.

11:53.446 --> 11:56.683
- YES. WE WILL DANCE.
- [singing in foreign language]

11:59.786 --> 12:01.054
- $9,000.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.157
RYAN, I'M NOT HERE TO FIGHT,

12:04.190 --> 12:05.625
AND ESPECIALLY NOT
IN FRONT OF YOU.

12:05.658 --> 12:07.160
- THIS IS SO [bleep] THAT
YOU'RE DOING THIS RIGHT NOW.

12:07.193 --> 12:08.661
- LIKE, YOU REALLY,
DEEPLY HURT ME.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.137
- RYAN.
- YEAH.

12:17.170 --> 12:20.140
- HEY, DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?

12:20.173 --> 12:22.942
- OKAY, I REALLY WANT
YOUR FEEDBACK ON 225 FIFTH.

12:22.976 --> 12:25.211
THERE'S ALL THIS STUFF
WE GOTTA START--HEY.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.813
- DO YOU HAVE TIME
THIS AFTERNOON MAYBE?

12:26.846 --> 12:28.848
OH, MAYBE YOU'RE
IN THE OFFICE. OKAY.

12:28.882 --> 12:31.685
- OKAY, SO I REALLY WANT TO DO
A SPECIAL EVENT FOR THIS.

12:31.718 --> 12:32.986
YOU KNOW.
- ONE SECOND.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.554
- RYAN.
- ONE SECOND, ONE SECOND.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.089
ONE SECOND.
THERE I AM. OKAY.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.590
- OKAY, I WAS THINKING,

12:37.624 --> 12:40.126
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE WE SHOULD
DO AN ART GALLERY EVENT,

12:40.160 --> 12:41.461
LIKE AN ART SALON.

12:41.494 --> 12:44.130
- ART GALLERY, THAT'S LIKE
HOLES IN WALLS AND ART

12:44.164 --> 12:46.099
AND PEOPLE AND ALL THIS STUFF.

12:46.132 --> 12:48.001
- OKAY, ANYWAY,
YOU KNOW,

12:48.101 --> 12:50.170
IT USED TO BE
A GIFT SHOW BUILDING.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.971
WHY DON'T WE DO SOMETHING
WITH GIFTS? LIKE--

12:52.005 --> 12:54.374
- WELL, WE COULD WRAP
A BUNCH OF CONTRACTS UP.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.109
- [scoffs] OKAY,
I REALLY WANT YOUR FEEDBACK.

12:56.142 --> 12:57.577
- YOU WANT TO DO AN EVENT?
- YES.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.611
- OKAY.

12:58.645 --> 13:00.480
WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT THIS APARTMENT?

13:00.513 --> 13:02.382
IT HAS NO VIEWS,

13:02.415 --> 13:03.750
SO WE CAN'T SHOW IT
DURING THE DAY.

13:03.783 --> 13:04.751
WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
RIGHT?

13:04.784 --> 13:06.052
- YES, YES.

13:06.052 --> 13:07.053
- SO WHY DON'T WE DO SOMETHING
AT NIGHT?

13:07.053 --> 13:08.488
LET'S MAKE IT LATE, ALL RIGHT,

13:08.521 --> 13:10.256
'CAUSE BROKERS ARE OUT
WHEN THEY'RE ALL AT, YOU KNOW,

13:10.290 --> 13:11.691
ALL THE NEW RESTAURANTS,
AND THEY'RE AT,

13:11.725 --> 13:13.460
YOU KNOW, THE NOMAD
AND ALL THAT STUFF IN THAT AREA.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.595
RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA CATCH
ALL THOSE PEOPLE AFTER DINNER.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.064
IT'S GONNA BE
THE AFTER-PARTY OPEN HOUSE

13:18.098 --> 13:20.834
SO THAT THEY LEAVE
ONLY THINKING ABOUT 7S.

13:20.867 --> 13:21.935
- HMM. I LIKE THAT.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.203
- NO ONE'S EVER
DONE THAT BEFORE.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.472
- I HAVE TO DISTRACT PEOPLE
FROM THE EMPTY SPACE

13:25.505 --> 13:27.374
AND THE AWFUL VIEWS.

13:27.407 --> 13:28.808
THAT'S GENIUS.
I MEAN, I AM--I AM--

13:28.842 --> 13:30.510
I AM, LIKE, HERE WITH YOU.

13:30.543 --> 13:32.379
LET'S PICK A DATE.
LET'S LOCK IT UP.

13:32.412 --> 13:33.713
THERE YOU GO. COOL?

13:33.747 --> 13:35.281
- YEAH, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
- GREAT.

13:42.889 --> 13:44.724
FOR MY BROKERS OPEN
AT WARREN STREET,

13:44.758 --> 13:47.360
I AM FOCUSING IN
ON THE POSITIVE,

13:47.394 --> 13:48.495
WHICH IS GREEN.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.530
JORDAN.
- IN HERE, FREDRIK.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.532
- I'M CREATING
AN EXCITING OPEN HOUSE

13:52.565 --> 13:53.733
WITH LOTS OF GIZMOS

13:53.767 --> 13:56.569
TO MAKE PEOPLE FORGET
ABOUT THE MONTHLIES.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.171
IS THAT THAT BIKE
THAT WE ORDERED?

13:58.204 --> 14:00.140
- YES.
WE STILL HAVE TO ASSEMBLE IT.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.274
- IT'S 30 MINUTES.
- WE CAN DO IT.

14:01.307 --> 14:04.177
IT ONLY TAKES 20 TO DO.
- "WE"? YOU.

14:04.210 --> 14:05.478
TODAY, I'M GONNA PROVE
TO EVERYONE

14:05.512 --> 14:07.047
WALKING THROUGH THAT DOOR

14:07.080 --> 14:09.549
THAT IT'S WORTH
$9,000 A MONTH

14:09.582 --> 14:11.384
TO SAVE BEAUTIFUL
MOTHER EARTH.

14:11.418 --> 14:12.919
OKAY, CAN YOU PUT THIS
IN THE BATHROOM?

14:12.952 --> 14:13.920
THAT'S RECYCLED.

14:13.953 --> 14:15.355
I MEAN, CALL IT WHAT YOU WANT.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.757
IT COULD BE CALLED A GIMMICK.
28 MINUTES.

14:17.791 --> 14:19.659
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY'RE
GONNA LEAVE REMEMBERING--

14:19.693 --> 14:21.327
OH, THIS IS THE COMPOST.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.962
HE DIDN'T USE ANY ELECTRICITY.

14:23.063 --> 14:27.233
HE SOLD THE APARTMENT
NOT USING A SINGLE WATT.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.836
- IT'S DONE. IT'S COMPLETELY,
COMPLETELY FINISHED.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.806
NOW WE CAN START
MAKING SMOOTHIES.

14:32.839 --> 14:34.808
- ARE YOU SWEATING?

14:34.841 --> 14:36.643
IS THAT SWEAT?
- THAT'S SWEAT.

14:36.676 --> 14:39.913
- TAKES A LOT TO BUILD
A GREEN BIKE.

14:39.946 --> 14:43.350
- WAIT, I DON'T SEE
THIS WORKING, JORDAN.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.490
- IT'S NOT BLENDING.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.325
LET ME GO BACK
TO THE DIRECTIONS.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.094
- [sighs]
[doorbell chimes]

14:54.094 --> 14:55.195
THIS GREEN THING IS HARD.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.796
HI.

14:56.830 --> 14:58.098
AH.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.300
WE'RE HAVING SO MUCH FUN HERE.
GOOD.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.035
SO, EVERYONE,
COME WITH ME.

15:02.035 --> 15:04.371
EVERYTHING'S GREEN. I MEAN, HAVE
YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT?

15:04.404 --> 15:05.939
LOOK, 14-FOOT CEILINGS.

15:06.039 --> 15:08.274
SOUTHERN EXPOSURE.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.877
THE APARTMENT IS
3,400 SQUARE FEET,

15:10.910 --> 15:12.212
AND THAT'S ONLY INDOORS.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.514
AND THEN YOU HAVE
FOUR OUTDOOR SPACES.

15:14.547 --> 15:15.548
LOOK AT THE VIEWS, GUYS.

15:15.582 --> 15:16.750
THE FREEDOM TOWER.
- RIGHT.

15:16.783 --> 15:18.618
- AND LOOK AT THAT.
THAT'S BROOKLYN BRIDGE.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.920
HOW BEAUTIFUL IS THAT?
TAKE A PICTURE.

15:20.954 --> 15:23.523
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT
FOR ALL YOU GREENIES LIKE ME.

15:23.556 --> 15:25.125
LOOK UP THERE,
AND WHAT DO YOU SEE?

15:25.158 --> 15:28.528
SOLAR PANELS RUNNING
THE ENTIRE APARTMENT.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.230
- WHAT OTHER AMENITIES ARE
WITH THE BUILDING?

15:30.263 --> 15:32.899
- IT'S NOT REALLY
A HEAVILY AMENITIZED BUILDING.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.502
BUT REALLY, THE AMENITIES
ARE TRIBECA, THE PARK, THIS.

15:35.535 --> 15:38.405
- OH, PHOOEY.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.974
- $9,000.

15:44.911 --> 15:47.947
- NO. $9,000 A MONTH
TO HELP MOTHER EARTH?

15:47.981 --> 15:50.750
AND THIS IS THE MASTER BATHROOM.
[laughter]

15:50.784 --> 15:52.452
EVERYONE SAYS
THE SAME THING.

15:52.485 --> 15:55.455
THE MONTHLIES ARE TOO HIGH.
- 9,000.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.257
- WELL, THAT'S ASSUMING
IT'S A BIG APARTMENT.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.324
- I DON'T KNOW.
- THAT'S A LITTLE HIGH.

15:58.358 --> 15:59.693
- SO I NEED TO DO SOMETHING,

15:59.726 --> 16:02.028
SO PEOPLE DON'T REALLY
STAY FOCUSED ON THE NUMBERS.

16:02.028 --> 16:03.863
WHO'S UP FOR A SMOOTHIE?

16:03.897 --> 16:05.331
[laughter]

16:05.365 --> 16:07.567
SO I'M SURE YOU ALL
HAVE GREEN BUYERS.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.602
- OH, YEAH.
[laughter]

16:09.636 --> 16:11.271
- THIS IS SO GREAT.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.541
[blender whistles]
- IT'S VERY HARD.

16:14.574 --> 16:17.110
[whistling continues]

16:17.143 --> 16:18.378
[laughter]

16:21.881 --> 16:23.316
[blender whistles]

16:23.350 --> 16:24.351

17:14.601 --> 17:16.569
LET'S DO THIS.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.805
SO NOW THAT TODD LOOKS AMAZING,
I AM LOOKING FOR TWO THINGS.

17:18.838 --> 17:20.273
HELLO. HOW ARE YOU?

17:20.306 --> 17:21.775

17:21.808 --> 17:24.611
I NEED HIM TO SHOW THIS PLACE
EFFECTIVELY, AND WE'RE GOOD.

17:24.644 --> 17:27.047
THIS IS MY COLLEAGUE TODD.
both: NICE TO MEET YOU.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.114
- PLEASE COME ON IN.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.382
CAN I TAKE YOUR COAT, DARLING?

17:29.416 --> 17:33.453
I'LL TAKE THAT AS WELL.
- THANK YOU.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.088
- OKAY.

17:46.366 --> 17:47.901
TODD, COME ON!
SPEAK!

17:47.934 --> 17:51.838
<i>POR FAVOR!</i>
[laughs]

17:51.871 --> 17:53.973
OKAY, SO LET'S SHOW THE REST.

17:54.074 --> 17:55.709
SO THE APARTMENT IS
FOUR BEDROOM,

17:55.742 --> 17:57.344
FOUR FULL BATHROOM.

17:57.377 --> 18:00.480
THIS IS A BUILDING
THAT WAS BUILT IN 1992,

18:00.513 --> 18:02.015
WHICH IS A GREAT INVESTMENT.

18:02.015 --> 18:04.918
TODD LOOKS EXTREMELY NERVOUS.
HIS CONFIDENCE IS NOT SHOWING.

18:05.018 --> 18:07.520
AND THAT IS NO GOOD.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.489
HELLO.

18:09.522 --> 18:10.557
both: HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.025
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR COMING IN.

18:12.025 --> 18:13.827

HOW ARE YOU, SIR?

18:16.162 --> 18:18.031
CAN I GET YOUR COAT?

18:18.064 --> 18:21.201
OKAY, SO, TODD,
YOU HAVE TO BE CONFIDENT.

18:21.234 --> 18:23.837
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.
YOU HAVE TO SPEAK UP.

18:23.870 --> 18:24.904
- YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.273
- I WANT YOU TO SELL
THIS PLACE.

18:27.307 --> 18:28.775
LET'S GO.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.277
LET ME SHOW YOU GUYS SOMETHING
IN THE DINING ROOM.

18:31.311 --> 18:34.147
ONE GOOD THING
THAT MOST PEOPLE HAVE DONE IS

18:34.180 --> 18:35.281
BEHIND THIS WALL
IS THE KITCHEN.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.816
SO YOU COULD TAKE
THIS WALL DOWN,

18:36.850 --> 18:39.052
MAKE AN ISLAND OUT OF IT,
AND FROM INSIDE THE KITCHEN,

18:39.052 --> 18:41.354
YOU'LL BE LOOKING
AT CENTRAL PARK, SO...

18:48.661 --> 18:50.697
[echoing] TODD, YOU HAVE
TO BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.

18:50.730 --> 18:51.698
YOU HAVE TO SPEAK UP.

18:51.731 --> 18:54.200
YOU HAVE TO BE CONFIDENT.

18:54.234 --> 18:55.602
LET'S GO.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.871
- WELL, I FEEL
WHEN YOU'RE AT THE GAME--

18:57.904 --> 18:59.406
FOOTBALL GAME,
BASKETBALL--

18:59.439 --> 19:01.041
YOU WANT
TO BE RIGHT ON GROUND LEVEL.

19:01.074 --> 19:02.542
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE UP
IN THE BALCONY

19:02.575 --> 19:04.010
LOOKING DOWN AT THE GAME.

19:04.044 --> 19:05.745
[laughter]
- OKAY.

19:05.779 --> 19:08.348
GOOD CALL.

19:09.683 --> 19:10.717
[claps]
LOVE IT.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.819
AT $2,400 A FOOT,
YOU CANNOT COMPETE

19:12.852 --> 19:13.820
WITH WHAT'S ON THE MARKET.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.622
- PLENTY OF CLOSET SPACE.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.924
MATTER OF FACT,
THIS CLOSET IS SO LARGE,

19:18.024 --> 19:19.192
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A BEDROOM.

19:19.225 --> 19:20.894
- THESE FLOORS ARE BEAUTIFUL.
- YES.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.729
- THE FLOORS ARE ACTUALLY
ORIGINAL, FROM 1992.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.031
- THIS IS
A GREAT SCHOOL DISTRICT.

19:25.065 --> 19:27.133
THIS IS A GREAT AREA
FOR SHOPPING.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.536
AND THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL VIEW,
OF COURSE, AGAIN.

19:29.569 --> 19:30.670
- YES!
ALL RIGHT, TODD.

19:30.704 --> 19:31.805
THERE HE IS.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.373

MEETING YOU, ASHLEY.

19:33.406 --> 19:34.641
- YOU TOO.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.576
- I HAVE TO SAY
THAT I'M VERY PROUD OF TODD.

19:36.609 --> 19:37.877
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

19:37.911 --> 19:40.046
- IT'S NOT PERFECT,
BUT WE ARE GETTING THERE.

19:40.046 --> 19:41.114
[door closes]

19:41.147 --> 19:42.849
GOOD JOB.
- THAT WAS AWESOME.

19:42.882 --> 19:46.086
THANK YOU, MAN.
- COME HERE, MAN.

19:46.119 --> 19:47.187
YOU DID A PHENOMENAL JOB.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.221
NOW WE HAVE TO SELL THIS,
ALL RIGHT?

19:48.254 --> 19:49.222
- DEFINITELY.

19:49.255 --> 19:50.290
- COME, LET'S EAT ALL THAT FOOD.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.125
[laughter]

19:52.158 --> 19:53.827
- THIS IS GOING TO BE AWESOME.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.129
YOU HAVE GLOW STICKS,
GLOW CANDY,

19:56.162 --> 19:58.064
A GLOW WALL.

19:58.064 --> 20:00.967
BUT I'VE GOT A SHOWING
IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES.

20:01.001 --> 20:02.836
THIS IS SO GROSS.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.237
I'M GONNA LOSE THIS PERSON
IF THEY WALK IN AND SEE THIS.

20:04.270 --> 20:06.072
[doorbell chimes]

20:17.217 --> 20:18.318
- WHOA.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.687
AT 225 FIFTH AVENUE,
LINDA AND I DECIDED

20:20.720 --> 20:23.990
TO DO AN OPEN HOUSE
COMPLETELY IN THE DARK.

20:24.024 --> 20:25.558
HOW'S IT GOING SO FAR?
- GOOD.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.093
EVERYTHING'S READY.
WE'RE ALL SET.

20:27.127 --> 20:28.161
- ALL RIGHT, SO WE GOT
THE BLACK LIGHTS.

20:28.194 --> 20:29.462
- BLACK LIGHTS EVERYWHERE.

20:29.496 --> 20:31.331
AND THIS IS
THE DANCE PARTY ROOM.

20:31.364 --> 20:33.500
HANG OUT, DANCE, DRINK.
- SWEET.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.101
THIS APARTMENT IS
NOW KIND OF COOL.

20:35.135 --> 20:36.169
- IT'S REALLY COOL.

20:36.202 --> 20:37.771
- THIS IS GOING TO BE AWESOME.

20:37.804 --> 20:40.273
BECAUSE NOT ONLY CAN YOU
NOT SEE THE [bleep] VIEW,

20:40.306 --> 20:43.843
BUT YOU GOT DJs, YOU HAVE
GLOW STICKS, GLOW CANDY,

20:43.877 --> 20:47.080
A GLOW WALL
WHERE YOU CAN WRITE ON IT,

20:47.113 --> 20:51.317
AND YOU HAVE MODELS
FROM THE FUTURE.

20:52.652 --> 20:55.088
- OH, MY GOD.
- OH, HELLO.

20:55.121 --> 20:57.290
- HEY.
- WELCOME TO THE RAVE.

20:57.323 --> 20:58.758
- WHOA.
- HERE YOU GO.

20:58.792 --> 20:59.959
- CHEERS.
both: CHEERS.

21:00.060 --> 21:01.327
- LESSON NUMBER ONE--

21:01.361 --> 21:03.430
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA SELL
AN APARTMENT WITH CRAPPY VIEWS

21:03.463 --> 21:06.633
UNLESS YOU DISTRACT PEOPLE
FROM WHAT THEY SHOULDN'T SEE.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.768
SO LET'S GET
THIS PARTY STARTED.

21:08.802 --> 21:11.771
[techno music]

21:11.805 --> 21:19.813

21:35.128 --> 21:38.098
- THE SPACE IS READY, RIGHT?

21:38.098 --> 21:42.469
* *

21:42.502 --> 21:43.503
MM-HMM.

21:43.536 --> 21:44.738
AND FOR ONLY 2.6 MILLION,

21:44.771 --> 21:47.107
YOU CAN LIVE HERE.
- [laughs]

21:47.107 --> 21:48.341
* *

21:48.375 --> 21:49.776
- THIS APARTMENT'S
KIND OF LIKE MEETING

21:49.809 --> 21:52.112
A REALLY UNATTRACTIVE PERSON
AT A BAR.

21:52.112 --> 21:54.814
THEIR FACE IS GONNA BE COVERED
BY THE DARK LIGHTS

21:54.848 --> 21:56.983
AND THE ALCOHOL,
AND THEN YOU DON'T FOCUS

21:57.017 --> 21:58.418
ON WHAT'S UNATTRACTIVE.

21:58.451 --> 22:01.254
YOU FOCUS ON THE SHAPE
AND THE TWO VERY BIG ROOMS.

22:01.287 --> 22:02.689
- IT'S A GREAT PARTY.

22:02.722 --> 22:04.324
- IT'S NOT A PARTY.
IT'S A VERY SERIOUS OPEN HOUSE.

22:04.357 --> 22:05.492
- [laughs]

22:05.525 --> 22:07.260
- OBVIOUSLY, YOU CAN FIT
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN HERE,

22:07.293 --> 22:08.395
AS YOU CAN SEE.

22:08.428 --> 22:09.929
- I THINK I MAY HAVE SOMEONE.
- GOOD.

22:09.963 --> 22:11.064
- AND HE'S A NIGHT OWL.

22:11.064 --> 22:13.433
* *

22:13.466 --> 22:15.268
- SO YOU HAVE SOMEBODY?
- I DO.

22:15.301 --> 22:17.070
I HAVE SOMEONE
WHO WORKS LONG HOURS.

22:17.070 --> 22:18.838
AND SHE LIKES
TO HOST PARTIES.

22:18.872 --> 22:21.574
SO YEAH, THIS IS
A GREAT, GREAT APARTMENT.

22:21.608 --> 22:22.809
I SEE THE POTENTIAL.
- AWESOME.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.077
- I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL
IN THE MORNING.

22:24.077 --> 22:25.211
- YEAH. I'LL BE AROUND.
- YEAH.

22:25.245 --> 22:26.680
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
- ALL RIGHT. SEE YA.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.548
I PROBABLY WOULD SAY
THIS BROKERS OPEN

22:28.581 --> 22:29.849
WAS A COMPLETE SUCCESS.

22:29.883 --> 22:30.984
EVERYONE'S IN HERE,
AND THEY'RE LIKE, "WOW.

22:31.084 --> 22:32.085
THIS IS
THE GREATEST APARTMENT EVER."

22:32.085 --> 22:34.287
- RYAN, NO MORE DRINKS.

22:37.590 --> 22:39.259
[horn honks]

22:39.292 --> 22:41.361
- HI, FREDRIK EKLUND HERE.
DOUGLAS ELLIMAN.

22:41.394 --> 22:42.395
- HEY, FRED.

22:42.429 --> 22:45.231
- SO YOU KNOW 16 WARREN,
THE PENTHOUSE?

22:45.265 --> 22:48.268
DO YOU GUYS HAVE ANY INTEREST?

22:53.306 --> 22:54.774
[sighs]

22:54.808 --> 22:59.179
MY WARREN STREET OPEN HOUSE
WAS A HUGE SUCCESS,

22:59.212 --> 23:00.480
AND I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED
I HAVEN'T HAD

23:00.513 --> 23:01.948
ANY PRIVATE SHOWING REQUESTS.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.417
SO I GOT TO FOLLOW UP
WITH PEOPLE

23:04.451 --> 23:06.152
AND GET SOME KIND OF OFFER
ON THE TABLE.

23:06.186 --> 23:08.388
SO 16 WARREN--
REMEMBER?

23:11.057 --> 23:12.559
WELL, I MEAN,
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER

23:12.592 --> 23:15.328
EVERYTHING IS GREEN, AND THEN
YOU HAVE FOUR OUTDOOR SPACES.

23:17.364 --> 23:19.499
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU.

23:22.135 --> 23:25.472
I NEED TO SELL THIS NOW.

23:25.505 --> 23:26.606
BYE.

23:26.639 --> 23:28.475
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE UP.

23:28.508 --> 23:29.843
- OKAY.

23:29.876 --> 23:31.978
- THIS IS ACTUALLY MAKING ME
MORE MOTIVATED THAN EVER.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.947
GREEN IS GOOD.
GREEN IS GREEN.

23:33.980 --> 23:35.548
EVERYBODY LIKES GREEN.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.851
DO YOU WANT TO PAY $10,000
A MONTH

23:37.884 --> 23:40.420
WITH NO DOORMAN OR
SWIMMING POOL OR GYM FOR GREEN?

23:40.453 --> 23:41.488
I DON'T KNOW.

23:41.521 --> 23:44.724
IF YOU RECONSIDER,
GIVE ME A CALL.

23:48.762 --> 23:51.698
[horn honks]

23:51.731 --> 23:53.767
[line trills]

23:56.102 --> 23:57.303
- VERY WELL.

23:57.337 --> 24:00.040
SORRY TO CALL YOU THIS EARLY,
BUT I GOT SOME NEWS.

24:00.040 --> 24:01.541
AFTER THE OPEN HOUSE,
TODD AND I

24:01.574 --> 24:04.044
HAVE BEEN SHOWING THIS APARTMENT
DAY IN AND DAY OUT.

24:04.077 --> 24:05.879
- ALL RIGHT.
NICE, NICE.

24:05.912 --> 24:06.880
NOW, BOOM!

24:06.913 --> 24:08.081
WE GOT A VERY GOOD OFFER.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.482
WELL, IT'S ACTUALLY
A DECENT OFFER.

24:09.516 --> 24:10.517
IT'S A GOOD START.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.552
IT'S 5.5.

24:15.588 --> 24:18.358
5.5 MILLION.

24:20.927 --> 24:23.129
SO YOU DON'T WANT TO COUNTER?

24:31.071 --> 24:32.739
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT
TO COUNTER

24:32.772 --> 24:35.075
BECAUSE EVERY BUYER
IN ANY TRANSACTION

24:35.108 --> 24:36.643
NEEDS TO FEEL LIKE HE'S HEARD.

24:36.676 --> 24:38.378
LET'S NOT GET AHEAD OF OURSELVES
JUST YET.

24:38.411 --> 24:39.846
SOMETHING VERY SMALL.

24:39.879 --> 24:41.448
FIRST OF ALL,
THIS IS AN INITIAL OFFER.

24:41.481 --> 24:44.084
IT'S JUST--IT'S THE BEGINNING
OF A CONVERSATION.

24:44.084 --> 24:45.318
NOW THIS IS WHAT I THINK.

24:45.352 --> 24:48.355
WHY DON'T WE JUST DROP
A VERY MINIMAL AMOUNT?

24:48.388 --> 24:50.256
I WANT TO LET THEM KNOW
THAT WE ARE HERE

24:50.290 --> 24:52.292
TO ENTERTAIN THEM,
JUST A BIT.

24:52.325 --> 24:54.794
25,000.

25:02.602 --> 25:04.237
OKAY. GOT IT.

25:04.270 --> 25:07.040
IF GETTING HER TO COME DOWN
25,000 WAS THIS TOUGH,

25:07.040 --> 25:08.775
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
LEFT TO DO,

25:08.808 --> 25:10.744
AND IT'S GET THAT BUYER UP
TO OUR PRICE.

25:10.777 --> 25:13.947
CIAO.

25:14.047 --> 25:15.949
[sighs]

25:28.261 --> 25:30.964
- WHAT THE [bleep]?

25:31.064 --> 25:32.932
IT'S LIKE A BOMB WENT OFF
IN HERE.

25:32.966 --> 25:34.734
IT LOOKS LIKE I WALKED
INTO A COLLEGE FRAT PARTY

25:34.768 --> 25:35.802
THE MORNING AFTER.

25:35.835 --> 25:37.103
OH, WHAT THE--

25:37.137 --> 25:39.572
I MEAN, I HAVE GOT A SHOWING
IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES.

25:39.606 --> 25:41.341
THIS IS SO GROSS.

25:41.374 --> 25:43.276
OH, MAN,
IT'S COVERED IN SEMEN.

25:43.309 --> 25:45.545
IT'S A TOTAL NIGHTMARE.
I--

25:45.578 --> 25:46.813
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO DO.

25:46.846 --> 25:49.816
- OH, MY GOD.

25:49.849 --> 25:51.418
- I THOUGHT THIS WAS
ALL CLEANED UP LAST NIGHT.

25:51.451 --> 25:52.786
- OH, MY GOD.

25:52.819 --> 25:54.554
YOU SAID--I THOUGHT IT WAS
GONNA BE ALL TAKEN CARE OF.

25:54.587 --> 25:57.957
- THE FIRST PERSON TO SEE
AN APARTMENT IS,

25:57.991 --> 25:59.592
NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN,
YOUR BUYER.

25:59.626 --> 26:00.593
REMEMBER LAST NIGHT,
WHEN I WAS, LIKE,

26:00.627 --> 26:02.595
"HEY, I THINK WE GOT SOMEBODY"?

26:02.629 --> 26:04.097
I'M GONNA TRY TO GET HIM
FIRST THING IN TOMORROW.

26:04.130 --> 26:05.765
AND THEN YOU WERE LIKE,
"OH, GREAT.

26:05.799 --> 26:06.800
"I'M GONNA HAVE
THE CLEANING PEOPLE COME,

26:06.833 --> 26:08.134
LIKE, AT THE END
OF THE DAY TOMORROW."

26:08.168 --> 26:10.737
I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED
WITH, LIKE, THE COMMUNICATION.

26:10.770 --> 26:12.605
- OKAY, I DON'T KNOW.
- AND I'M GONNA LOSE THIS PERSON

26:12.639 --> 26:15.542
IF THEY WALK IN AND SEE
THIS TOTAL [bleep] SHOW.

26:15.575 --> 26:16.910
OH, MY PANTS.

26:16.943 --> 26:20.046
[doorbell chimes]
- OH, MY GOD.

26:20.080 --> 26:21.147
OH, MY GOD.

26:21.181 --> 26:24.217
- [whispers]
WAIT, WAIT. SHH, SHH.

26:25.819 --> 26:27.454
[doorbell chimes]
OH, IT'S THEM.

26:27.487 --> 26:28.521
OKAY. LET ME DO THAT.
- OKAY.

26:28.555 --> 26:29.589
OKAY, GIVE IT TO ME.
GET THE DOOR.

26:29.622 --> 26:31.891
- [groans]
- HERE.

26:31.925 --> 26:33.326
- CAN YOU TAKE THIS?

26:33.360 --> 26:35.829
GO PUT THESE IN THE CLOSET.

26:35.862 --> 26:38.798
[doorbell chimes]
[high-pitched] COMING!

26:38.832 --> 26:40.133
[groans]

26:40.166 --> 26:44.237
- HERE, HERE, HERE.
CLOSET.

26:44.270 --> 26:45.672
[doorbell chimes]

26:45.705 --> 26:47.273
- YEP, ONE SECOND.

26:47.307 --> 26:49.242
HOLD ON.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.077
WHEW. HI.

26:51.111 --> 26:52.078
- HI.
- HEY.

26:52.112 --> 26:53.079
- HI.

26:53.113 --> 26:54.080
HEY, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

26:54.114 --> 26:55.448
- GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
- SORRY.

26:55.482 --> 26:56.816
I WAS JUST TIDYING UP
A LITTLE BIT IN THE BACK THERE.

26:56.850 --> 26:58.218
HI, I'M RYAN.
- THIS IS BONNIE.

26:58.251 --> 26:59.619
- BONNIE. NICE TO MEET YOU.
- HEY, BONNIE. HOW ARE YOU?

26:59.652 --> 27:02.489
WELCOME TO 7S.
- THANKS.

27:02.522 --> 27:04.391
- HAVE YOU BEEN LOOKING
IN THE AREA FOR A WHILE?

27:04.424 --> 27:06.292
- I HAVE.
- IS THE APARTMENT FOR YOU?

27:06.326 --> 27:07.761
- IT'S FOR MY SISTER.
- FOR YOUR SISTER?

27:07.794 --> 27:09.062
- YEAH.
- AND SHE'S MOVING TO NEW YORK?

27:09.095 --> 27:10.663
- YES, SHE'S RELOCATING.
- RELOCATING.

27:10.697 --> 27:11.765
- FROM CHICAGO.

27:11.798 --> 27:13.299
- I THINK THIS IS
A GREAT APARTMENT

27:13.333 --> 27:14.768
FOR SOMEONE WHO'S RELOCATING.

27:14.801 --> 27:17.270
SO WE'LL KEEP YOU HERE
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.572
FEEL FREE TO TAKE PICTURES
IF YOU WANT TO.

27:19.606 --> 27:21.107
I GOTTA FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO KEEP THEM INTERESTED

27:21.141 --> 27:23.276
IN THIS KITCHEN
AS LONG AS I CAN

27:23.309 --> 27:24.577
AND KEEP THEM DISTRACTED.

27:24.611 --> 27:27.180
SO THE FAUCET WORKS.
IT'S COLD.

27:27.213 --> 27:29.049
AND THAT IS HOT.

27:29.082 --> 27:30.550
AND THERE'S
A GARBAGE DISPOSAL...

27:30.583 --> 27:31.584
[garbage disposal rumbles]

27:31.618 --> 27:32.819
SO YOU CAN PUT THINGS
DOWN THERE,

27:32.852 --> 27:34.821
AND YOU CAN DISPOSE OF THEM
INTO THE GARBAGE.

27:34.854 --> 27:37.290
AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS WHOLE,
NICE, BIG MASTER BATHROOM.

27:37.323 --> 27:38.825
SO YOU HAVE DOUBLE VANITY.

27:38.858 --> 27:41.061
- YEAH, SHE'LL LOVE THIS.
IT'S VERY MODERN.

27:41.061 --> 27:42.762
- SO HERE, YOU SPLIT,
AND YOU'RE INTO--

27:42.796 --> 27:44.464
THIS IS THE SECOND BEDROOM.

27:44.497 --> 27:45.465
JUST GIVE ME ONE SECOND.

27:45.498 --> 27:46.866
AND THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM.

27:46.900 --> 27:48.468
AND THEN YOU HAVE
A FULL BATHROOM THERE.

27:48.501 --> 27:49.602
GOOD CLOSET SPACE.

27:49.636 --> 27:51.838
YOU HAVE A REALLY, BIG,
BIG SECOND BEDROOM.

27:51.871 --> 27:53.707
- YEAH, I THINK
IT'S A REALLY GOOD SIZE.

27:53.740 --> 27:56.076
I MEAN, SHE DID WANT SOME VIEW,
BUT IT'S STILL PRETTY NEW.

27:56.076 --> 27:57.877
THE SPACE IS BIG,
SO SHE MIGHT LIKE IT.

27:57.911 --> 27:59.279
- YEAH.

27:59.312 --> 28:02.682
- SO I THINK THIS WILL BE
A GOOD SPACE FOR YOUR SISTER.

28:02.716 --> 28:04.818
SINCE SHE'S IN FINANCE,
SHE'S OUT ALL DAY.

28:04.851 --> 28:07.187
SO IT'S NOT LIKE
SHE'S MISSING ANYTHING.

28:07.220 --> 28:08.788
- BONNIE'S SISTER
IS IN FINANCE,

28:08.822 --> 28:11.624
MEANING HER HOURS
ARE GONNA BE AWFUL,

28:11.658 --> 28:13.493
SO SHE'S REALLY ONLY GONNA
BE IN THE APARTMENT

28:13.526 --> 28:15.695
WHEN IT'S DARK ANYWAY,

28:15.729 --> 28:17.030
AND THAT'S PERFECT.

28:17.063 --> 28:19.032
- SO GOOD TO MEET YOU.
- ALL RIGHT, NICE MEETING YOU.

28:19.065 --> 28:20.233
- ALL RIGHT, STAY IN TOUCH.
- WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

28:20.266 --> 28:21.668
YEAH, DEFINITELY.

28:21.701 --> 28:23.036
- BYE. THANK YOU.
- BYE.

28:23.036 --> 28:25.705
[sighs]

28:25.739 --> 28:29.042
- IF THEY BUY IT,
I WILL BE [bleep] SHOCKED.

28:32.545 --> 28:34.814
- WELL, LAST TIME,
YOU HUMILIATED ME.

28:34.848 --> 28:37.083
- I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER.

28:42.589 --> 28:43.923
- HI, BABE.
OH, MY GOD.

28:43.957 --> 28:45.325
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

28:45.358 --> 28:46.659
WE'RE JUST
IN THE BEGINNING STAGES

28:46.693 --> 28:48.561
OF HAVING OUR BABY,
AND IT'S REALLY EXCITING.

28:48.595 --> 28:50.430
LOOK, BABY.
"I LOVE DADDY."

28:50.463 --> 28:51.831
EXCITING?
- YEAH, THAT'S VERY SWEET.

28:51.865 --> 28:54.534
- AT THIS POINT, I THINK
DEREK'S A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS.

28:54.567 --> 28:56.803
BUT I DO BELIEVE,
AS WE GO ALONG,

28:56.836 --> 28:59.305
HE'LL START TO EASE UP
AND FEEL BETTER ABOUT IT.

28:59.339 --> 29:00.740
SHE'S SO CUTE.
SHE CAN KICK.

29:00.774 --> 29:01.908
WHEE!

29:02.008 --> 29:03.610
WHEE!
[laughter]

29:03.643 --> 29:05.412
MAYBE WE CAN TRY IT
ON MOUSEY FIRST.

29:05.445 --> 29:07.280
SEE IF IT FITS.
- WELL, PUT HER IN IT.

29:07.313 --> 29:08.548
YEAH, LET'S SEE
WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE.

29:08.581 --> 29:09.783
- MOUSEY.
[Mousey whines]

29:09.816 --> 29:11.117
OH, MOUSEY.
THERE YOU ARE.

29:11.151 --> 29:13.019
[grunts]
- OH.

29:13.019 --> 29:14.254
[laughs]

29:14.287 --> 29:15.622
- I MEAN, HOW DO YOU OPEN THIS?
HERE.

29:15.655 --> 29:17.257
OH, MY GOD.
- YEAH.

29:17.290 --> 29:18.458
- OKAY, WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO LEARN HOW TO DO THIS.

29:18.491 --> 29:20.460
- HEAD FIRST.
- OH, WHAT DO WE DO DOWN HERE?

29:20.493 --> 29:22.595
WAIT, WAIT.
THERE IT IS.

29:22.629 --> 29:23.596
OH, MY GOD.

29:23.630 --> 29:26.599
- IT ACTUALLY FITS HER.

29:26.633 --> 29:28.368
- "I LOVE DADDY."
- [laughs]

29:28.401 --> 29:29.769
[Mousey growls]

29:39.546 --> 29:41.047
- HI.
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

29:41.047 --> 29:43.616
- I'M MEETING WITH ANGELA,
THE SELLER OF 225 5TH AVENUE,

29:43.650 --> 29:45.151
BECAUSE, LO AND BEHOLD,

29:45.185 --> 29:49.122
BONNIE'S SISTER
ACTUALLY LIKES THE APARTMENT.

29:49.155 --> 29:53.193
AND I HAVE AN OFFER FOR HER,
WHICH IS BEST AND FINAL.

29:53.226 --> 29:55.061
YEAH, SO WE HAVE
OUR FIRST OFFER.

29:55.095 --> 29:56.396
LINDA CAN'T MAKE IT,

29:56.429 --> 29:58.498
AND HER CLIENT IS ONLY HERE
FOR A FEW MORE HOURS

29:58.531 --> 30:00.367
BEFORE SHE HEADS BACK
TO CALIFORNIA,

30:00.400 --> 30:03.003
SO I'M GONNA SIT HER DOWN
AND GET THIS DONE.

30:03.036 --> 30:05.038
IT'S ONE OF THE HIGHEST PRICES
PER SQUARE FOOT

30:05.071 --> 30:06.506
THAT THE BUILDING
WILL HAVE RECEIVED,

30:06.539 --> 30:11.411
AND IT IS 2.4, CASH,
BEST AND FINAL.

30:15.348 --> 30:19.085
- UH, WHERE'S THE OTHER 2?

30:19.119 --> 30:21.287
- WHERE'S THE OTHER 200,000?
- YES.

30:21.321 --> 30:25.692
- IN THE BUYER'S POCKET,
AND THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE IT.

30:25.725 --> 30:28.528
- I REALLY CAN'T ACCEPT 2.4.

30:28.561 --> 30:30.630
DO YOU REMEMBER,
YOU BROUGHT ME THAT FROM 3

30:30.663 --> 30:34.401
TO 2.6, AND YOU CONVINCED ME
THAT WAS THE ABSOLUTE MINIMUM

30:34.434 --> 30:36.503
THAT YOU COULD GET.
- RIGHT.

30:36.536 --> 30:38.004
- SO I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD BE COMING AT ME

30:38.038 --> 30:41.374
WITH THIS HAPPY FACE
THAT YOU'VE DONE YOUR JOB.

30:42.976 --> 30:46.046
- REMEMBER, THERE ARE
NO OTHER OFFERS OUT THERE.

30:46.079 --> 30:48.615
AND 2.4 IS VERY STRONG.

30:48.648 --> 30:51.584
THAT'S OVER $1,800
PER SQUARE FOOT

30:51.618 --> 30:55.021
FOR YOUR APARTMENT,
WHICH FACES A BRICK WALL.

30:55.055 --> 30:56.623
RIGHT?

30:56.656 --> 30:58.725
THE GOAL IS NOT JUST TO LIST
AN APARTMENT.

30:58.758 --> 31:01.227
IT'S TO SELL IT.

31:01.261 --> 31:03.830
AND WHAT I FOUND
IS THAT,

31:03.863 --> 31:06.166
WHEN SOMEONE PUTS $2.4 MILLION

31:06.199 --> 31:09.602
IN YOUR HAND,
YOU CLOSE YOUR HAND.

31:13.173 --> 31:16.543
- BRING HER UP.

31:16.576 --> 31:19.379
- EVEN THOUGH NICOLE HAS SAID
THE OFFER'S BEST AND FINAL,

31:19.412 --> 31:21.214
IT'S MY JOB TO DO
THE DUE DILIGENCE

31:21.247 --> 31:23.616
FOR MY CLIENT SO THAT
I'M NOT WASTING THEIR TIME.

31:23.650 --> 31:27.153
AND SOMETIMES YOUR CLIENT
JUST NEEDS TO HEAR IT DIRECTLY

31:27.187 --> 31:29.389
FROM THE HORSE'S MOUTH.
[line trills]

31:29.422 --> 31:30.824
HEY, NICOLE.

31:30.857 --> 31:33.126
I'M SITTING HERE
WITH MY SELLER,

31:33.159 --> 31:35.095
AND WE'RE GOING
THROUGH ALL OF THE OTHER OFFERS

31:35.128 --> 31:37.497
AND, YOU KNOW, SEEING
WHO WE'RE GONNA GET BACK TO

31:37.530 --> 31:39.666
AND WHO'S GONNA GET
THE APARTMENT.

31:39.699 --> 31:40.934
AND, I MEAN,
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER,

31:40.967 --> 31:43.770
I THINK 2.4'S
A GREAT STARTING OFFER,

31:43.803 --> 31:46.806
BUT I DON'T THINK--

31:52.345 --> 31:54.981
WHY IS SHE DOING
A BEST AND FINAL?

31:59.352 --> 32:02.088
CAN WE DISCUSS IT
JUST A LITTLE BIT, THOUGH?

32:09.062 --> 32:10.497
THAT'S WHAT MY LIFE IS LIKE.

32:10.530 --> 32:12.132
NOW I GOT TO DEAL
WITH ANGRY BROKERS.

32:12.165 --> 32:13.700
- I'M HERE FOR
A VERY FINITE PERIOD OF TIME.

32:13.733 --> 32:15.068
I REALLY WANT TO CLOSE THIS.

32:15.068 --> 32:18.605
SO I WANT YOU
JUST TO FIGURE IT OUT.

32:21.541 --> 32:23.276
- A LARGE PART OF MY JOB
IS KNOWING WHEN TO PUSH

32:23.309 --> 32:24.477
AND WHEN TO PULL.

32:24.511 --> 32:26.379
I'M NOT GONNA DO
ANYTHING ILLEGAL

32:26.413 --> 32:29.149
LIKE CALL A BROKER'S CLIENT
DIRECTLY.

32:29.182 --> 32:32.986
BUT IN THIS CASE, THERE'S
A LITTLE BIT OF A LOOPHOLE,

32:33.086 --> 32:34.821
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
THE CLIENT,

32:34.854 --> 32:36.890
I KNOW THE CLIENT'S SISTER.

32:36.923 --> 32:37.991
[line trills]

32:38.091 --> 32:40.393
HI, IS THIS BONNIE?

32:40.427 --> 32:42.228
AND IT IS PERFECTLY OKAY
TO CALL HER.

32:42.262 --> 32:44.731
THIS IS RYAN,
THE LISTING BROKER

32:44.764 --> 32:47.600
FOR 225 5TH AVENUE.

32:47.634 --> 32:50.804
I'M GOOD.
THANK YOU.

32:50.837 --> 32:53.173
SO I JUST WANTED TO CALL
AND SAY

32:53.206 --> 32:55.108
IT KIND OF SUCKS
THAT YOUR SISTER

32:55.108 --> 32:58.545
ISN'T GONNA GET
THE APARTMENT, HUH?

32:58.578 --> 33:01.081
WELL, HER BROKER
MADE AN OFFER

33:01.114 --> 33:03.950
THAT'S JUST TOO LOW
AND SAID IT WAS BEST AND FINAL

33:04.050 --> 33:06.319
AT 2.4.

33:14.461 --> 33:15.628
ALL RIGHT, THANKS, BONNIE.
- OKAY.

33:15.662 --> 33:17.063
- ALL RIGHT, BYE.

33:17.063 --> 33:19.666
THAT'S WHAT I DO.
SCORE.

33:22.736 --> 33:24.304
[knock at door]
- HELLO?

33:24.337 --> 33:25.572
MYRA!

33:25.605 --> 33:26.706
- HELLO?
- MWAH.

33:26.740 --> 33:28.575
- I DON'T GET TO HUG
MY MOTHER FIRST?

33:28.608 --> 33:30.643
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
HE GETS THE LONG ONE.

33:30.677 --> 33:32.212
[laughter]

33:32.245 --> 33:33.680
- AFTER I GOT
THIS VERY SMALL COUNTEROFFER

33:33.713 --> 33:35.849
FROM MYRA AND SANDY,
I WENT BACK TO MY BUYER.

33:35.882 --> 33:37.717
OH, MY GOD.
COME HERE.

33:37.751 --> 33:39.519
NOW TODD AND I ARE HERE
FOR AN UPDATE.

33:39.552 --> 33:41.855
SO LAST TIME WE SPOKE,

33:41.888 --> 33:43.690
WE HAD AN OFFER
ORIGINALLY AT 5.5.

33:43.723 --> 33:45.759
YOU GUYS SAID
THAT WE'RE GOING TO AGREE

33:45.792 --> 33:47.660
TO 5.975
IF I COULD BRING HIM THERE.

33:47.694 --> 33:50.163
SO I WENT BACK TO MY BUYERS,
AND AFTER FIGHTING

33:50.196 --> 33:52.866
SOME BATTLES AND STRONG,
VERY STRONG NEGOTIATIONS,

33:52.899 --> 33:55.602
I WAS ABLE TO GET HIM
TO 5.975.

33:55.635 --> 33:59.406
SO THAT MEANS
THAT WE HAVE A DEAL.

33:59.439 --> 34:01.107
- YOU GOT HIM UP 475,000?

34:01.141 --> 34:04.778
- YES, SIR.
- HOW ABOUT A LITTLE MORE?

34:04.811 --> 34:06.046
- YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?

34:06.079 --> 34:08.048
- NO.
- NO, WE WERE TALKING

34:08.048 --> 34:09.449
ABOUT IT
THE WHOLE WEEKEND.

34:09.482 --> 34:13.186
- WE WERE CONSIDERING
RAISING IT TO 6.2.

34:13.219 --> 34:14.454
- MM-HMM.

34:14.487 --> 34:16.956
- RAISING THE PRICE,
ARE YOU CRAZY?

34:17.057 --> 34:19.325
WE'RE SO CLOSE.
WE'RE DOING NEGOTIATION.

34:19.359 --> 34:21.094
WE HAVE SOMEONE ON THE PLATE,
AND YOU WANT TO RAISE THE PRICE?

34:21.127 --> 34:24.764
- WE FEEL THAT 6.2
IS WHAT WE SHOULD ACCEPT.

34:24.798 --> 34:27.600
- RAISING THE PRICE?

34:27.634 --> 34:30.203
YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS?
- NO.

34:30.236 --> 34:31.638
- WE AGREED ON DOING
THE 5.975.

34:31.671 --> 34:35.742
- I KNOW, BUT,
WHEN PEOPLE COME UP THAT FAST,

34:35.775 --> 34:38.378
THAT MEANS
THEY CAN COME UP AGAIN,

34:38.411 --> 34:41.681
THAT MEANS
THEY HAVE THE MONEY.

34:41.715 --> 34:44.084
- WE TELL 'EM THAT,
THEY ARE WALKING AWAY,

34:44.084 --> 34:46.353
AND WE'RE BACK TO ZERO.

34:47.787 --> 34:50.924
UM, THIS IS THE REALITY.

34:50.957 --> 34:52.492
WE WERE WORKING VERY HARD.

34:52.525 --> 34:54.227
WE WERE CALLING PEOPLE
LEFT AND RIGHT.

34:54.260 --> 34:55.662
WE WERE BRINGING, YOU KNOW,
RIGHT BUYERS HERE,

34:55.695 --> 34:58.131
BUT WE ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON
THAT HAS MADE AN OFFER.

34:58.164 --> 35:01.468
- LUIS, LUIS, LET ME TAKE
THE FLOOR FOR A SECOND.

35:01.501 --> 35:02.836
THESE ARE MY FOLKS.
LET ME EXPLAIN.

35:02.869 --> 35:04.070
- OKAY.

35:04.104 --> 35:05.939
- FIRST OF ALL,
I'VE ALL ALONG

35:06.039 --> 35:10.043
FELT THIS IS EVEN WORTH
IN THE 7 MILLION.

35:10.043 --> 35:13.513
THIS APARTMENT COULD BE WORTH
$9 MILLION.

35:13.546 --> 35:14.781
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

35:14.814 --> 35:17.183
- BUT I'VE REALIZED,
WORKING WITH LUIS,

35:17.217 --> 35:21.488
THAT THIS MARKET
IS LIKE A GAME OF FISHING.

35:21.521 --> 35:24.290
WE COULD END UP
PLAYING THIS FISHING GAME

35:24.324 --> 35:26.459
FOR ANOTHER TWO,
THREE MORE YEARS.

35:26.493 --> 35:27.794
YOU NEVER KNOW.

35:27.827 --> 35:29.629
THESE PEOPLE CAME UP A LOT.

35:29.662 --> 35:31.931
YOU KEEP ON PULLING TOO HARD
ON THE FISH,

35:31.965 --> 35:34.501
HE GETS OFF THE HOOK,
AND HE SWIMS AWAY.

35:34.534 --> 35:37.404
IF WE TRY TO GO
FOR ANOTHER FISH,

35:37.437 --> 35:40.640
WE NEVER KNOW WHEN WE'RE GONNA
CATCH THE OTHER FISH.

35:42.876 --> 35:45.078
YOU KNOW, WE CAUGHT THE FISH.

35:45.078 --> 35:48.982
IT'S TIME TO EAT THE FISH.

35:52.652 --> 35:55.088
- ARE YOU OKAY
WITH THAT, SANDY?

36:00.460 --> 36:01.895
WE SHOULD LISTEN TO TODD?

36:01.928 --> 36:03.363
- WE HAVE A DEAL?

36:03.396 --> 36:05.031
- OKAY.
YOU GOT A DEAL.

36:05.065 --> 36:06.900
- WE DO? REALLY?
[laughter]

36:06.933 --> 36:10.036
YES, CONGRATS TO YOU, TODD.

36:10.036 --> 36:11.705
I REALLY MEAN THAT, SIR.

36:11.738 --> 36:13.340
I REALLY MEAN THAT.

36:13.373 --> 36:15.375
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
IT'S BEEN A PHENOMENAL PLEASURE

36:15.408 --> 36:18.411
TO WORK WITH YOU
AND TO WORK WITH TODD,

36:18.445 --> 36:21.214
AND HE'S BECOME SOMEONE THAT
I DO RESPECT AND ADMIRE A LOT.

36:21.247 --> 36:22.415
THIS GUY HAS COME A LONG WAY.

36:22.449 --> 36:23.917
- I'M GONNA START TO CRY.

36:23.950 --> 36:26.186
- OH, MY GOD, MYRA.

36:26.219 --> 36:28.355
SHE'S CRYING,
"I LOVE IT."

36:28.388 --> 36:30.657
TODD, GOOD JOB, BUDDY.

36:30.690 --> 36:32.726
GOOD JOB, MAN.
THANK YOU.

36:32.759 --> 36:33.827
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO CELEBRATE.

36:33.860 --> 36:35.428
- THANKS.
- LET'S GO EAT FISH.

36:35.462 --> 36:36.529
- LET'S GO EAT FISH.

36:36.563 --> 36:38.631
I AM DYING FOR SOME FISH
ACTUALLY.

36:42.669 --> 36:44.637
[cell phone ringing]

36:44.671 --> 36:47.507
- [stammering]
HELLO?

36:50.510 --> 36:52.078
WELL, I DIDN'T CALL
YOUR CLIENT.

36:52.078 --> 36:53.513
I CALLED
YOUR CLIENT'S SISTER.

36:56.883 --> 36:59.119
I WOULD HAVE GONE
WITH ONE OF THE OTHER OFFERS,

36:59.152 --> 37:00.620
BUT I WANT THE DEAL
TO GO TO YOU,

37:00.653 --> 37:04.357
AND I KNEW, I KNEW THAT
WE COULD INCH YOUR CLIENT UP

37:04.391 --> 37:06.793
JUST A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I KNEW
THEY WANTED IT.

37:13.667 --> 37:15.035
I DO HAVE THE SAME RESPECT
FOR YOU.

37:15.035 --> 37:17.037
THAT'S WHY I WANT TO GET
THIS DEAL DONE WITH YOU

37:17.037 --> 37:18.738
AND YOUR CLIENT SO BADLY.

37:18.772 --> 37:20.040
DID YOU TALK TO YOUR CLIENT?

37:20.073 --> 37:23.510
I THINK WE CAN JUST PUT ANGER
ASIDE HERE FOR A SECOND.

37:35.088 --> 37:37.457
2.5.

37:37.490 --> 37:39.325
ALL RIGHT.
THANKS, NICOLE.

37:39.359 --> 37:42.062
YOU ARE THE BEST.

37:42.095 --> 37:43.730
SO NOW YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT.

37:43.763 --> 37:45.732
- 2.5.

37:45.765 --> 37:48.668
I'M HAPPY
THAT WE'RE SETTING A NEW RECORD.

37:48.702 --> 37:51.638
- 2.5 MILLION.
THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY.

37:51.671 --> 37:54.908
- I THINK
I CAN DEAL WITH 2.5.

37:54.941 --> 37:55.909
- SHAKE ON IT. SHAKE ON IT.
- ALL RIGHT.

37:55.942 --> 37:57.444
DEAL.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

37:57.477 --> 37:59.179
- HANDSHAKE.
YOU CAN'T GO BACK FROM THIS.

37:59.212 --> 38:00.914
- I CAN'T.
- YOU CAN'T GO BACK FROM THIS.

38:01.014 --> 38:03.350
- I WON'T.
- CHECK, PLEASE.

38:10.824 --> 38:12.559
I'VE BEEN SHOWING
16 WARREN PENTHOUSE LIKE CRAZY

38:12.592 --> 38:15.061
TO A LOT OF PEOPLE,
AND EVERYONE SEEMS TO HAVE

38:15.095 --> 38:16.463
THE EXACT SAME FEEDBACK.

38:16.496 --> 38:17.731
HI, HOW ARE YOU?

38:17.764 --> 38:19.532
THOSE MONTHLIES
ARE WAY TOO HIGH.

38:19.566 --> 38:21.935
$10,000 A MONTH?
THAT'S CRAZY.

38:22.035 --> 38:23.570
LISTEN, GUYS,
I'M NOT GONNA LIE.

38:23.603 --> 38:24.671
THE COMMON CHARGES
AND REAL ESTATE TAXES

38:24.704 --> 38:25.672
ARE A LITTLE BIT
ON THE HIGH SIDE.

38:25.705 --> 38:27.240
- $9,000.

38:27.273 --> 38:28.608
ISN'T IT A LITTLE HIGH
FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

38:28.641 --> 38:29.776
DON'T YOU THINK?

38:29.809 --> 38:31.077
- I'M TRYING EVERYTHING.
HOW YOU DOING?

38:31.111 --> 38:32.512
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- NICE TO SEE YOU, MAN.

38:32.545 --> 38:35.048
- SO TONIGHT I'M GOING
TO A REAL ESTATE MIXER

38:35.048 --> 38:36.449
TO FIND A BUYER.

38:36.483 --> 38:37.817
A REALLY GOOD CROWD.

38:37.851 --> 38:39.352
IT'S ALL THE BIG DEVELOPERS
IN TOWN.

38:39.386 --> 38:41.354
- HEY.
- HOW ARE YOU?

38:41.388 --> 38:42.655
- HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD TO SEE YA.

38:42.689 --> 38:44.657
- I'M VERY HAPPY.
I'M VERY HAPPY.

38:44.691 --> 38:46.526
- GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD.

38:46.559 --> 38:49.062
THIS IS MY GIRLFRIEND AMELIA.

38:51.398 --> 38:53.700
- RYAN AND I HAVEN'T SEEN
EACH OTHER SINCE THAT NIGHT

38:53.733 --> 38:55.201
WHEN HE HUMILIATED ME.

38:55.235 --> 38:56.536
- IN THIS SCENE
YOU'RE ABOUT TO WATCH,

38:56.569 --> 38:59.072
THEY TAKE IT
FROM ONE ANOTHER.

38:59.105 --> 39:01.908
JUST REMEMBER,
I AM THE AMERICAN DREAM, BABY,

39:02.008 --> 39:05.311
AND YOU ARE
JUST A CHEAP, SHINY IMPORT.

39:05.345 --> 39:06.813
- AMELIA.
- AMELIA, NICE TO MEET YOU.

39:06.846 --> 39:08.882
- HE'S A TOUGH NEGOTIATOR.
HE DOES IT ON THE SPOT.

39:08.915 --> 39:10.817
- NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

39:10.850 --> 39:13.853
- SO I'M JUST A LITTLE
DISTRACTED STANDING RIGHT HERE.

39:13.887 --> 39:18.024
LIKE, SEEING HIM BRINGS ME
RIGHT BACK TO WHERE I WAS.

39:18.024 --> 39:21.094
ALL THE NIGHTS I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT WHAT HE DID TO ME

39:21.127 --> 39:23.930
IS RIGHT THERE IN THE ROOM,
RIGHT THERE.

39:24.030 --> 39:26.099
THERE'S SO MUCH
I WANT TO TELL HIM.

39:26.132 --> 39:27.233
- YEAH.

39:27.267 --> 39:29.936
HELLO.

39:30.036 --> 39:32.739
UGH.
FREDRIK.

39:32.772 --> 39:36.042
THERE IS NOTHING
LIKE SEEING THAT GUY

39:36.042 --> 39:39.145
TO TAKE ME DOWN FROM MY HIGH
OF SELLING 225 5TH AVENUE.

39:39.179 --> 39:40.947
HOW ARE YOU?
- I'M OKAY. HOW ARE YOU?

39:41.047 --> 39:42.282
- THIS IS AMELIA,
MY GIRLFRIEND.

39:42.315 --> 39:43.883
- YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.
- THANK YOU.

39:43.917 --> 39:46.619
- UM, I NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

39:46.653 --> 39:48.455
CAN WE GO AT LEAST TO--
A LITTLE MORE QUIET

39:48.488 --> 39:51.057
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE--
- SURE.

39:51.057 --> 39:53.827
- I JUST HAVE TO GET IT OUT.

39:53.860 --> 39:55.662
UM...
- IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

39:55.695 --> 39:58.465
- WELL, IT'S AWKWARD TO SEE YOU,
TO BE HONEST.

39:58.498 --> 40:00.333
LAST TIME,
WHEN I SAW YOU,

40:00.367 --> 40:02.369
YOU HUMILIATED ME
IN FRONT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE

40:02.402 --> 40:04.104
THAT I WORK WITH.

40:04.137 --> 40:07.240
- I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER.

40:07.273 --> 40:08.408
DUDE, I DON'T EVEN KNOW--
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER

40:08.441 --> 40:10.410
WHAT I DID YESTERDAY.

40:10.443 --> 40:13.613
- [sighs]
HERE WE GO.

40:15.615 --> 40:17.484
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT YOU HURT ME.

40:17.517 --> 40:19.285
- DO YOU WANT ME
TO CRY IN FRONT OF YOU?

40:19.319 --> 40:20.286
- RYAN, I HAVE FEE--
I'M A HUMAN BEING.

40:20.320 --> 40:21.821
I CRY.
DON'T YOU GET IT?

40:26.493 --> 40:29.596
- UM...
- IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

40:29.629 --> 40:32.732
- WELL, IT'S AWKWARD TO SEE YOU,
TO BE HONEST.

40:32.766 --> 40:36.503
LAST TIME, WHEN I SAW YOU,
YOU HUMILIATED ME

40:36.536 --> 40:39.339
IN FRONT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE
THAT I WORK WITH.

40:39.372 --> 40:41.741
- I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER.
- NO, BUT THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM.

40:41.775 --> 40:43.643
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TO PLAY
THIS, LIKE, REALLY TOUGH GUY,

40:43.677 --> 40:46.479
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT YOU HURT ME.

40:46.513 --> 40:48.148
LIKE, YOU REALLY,
DEEPLY HURT ME.

40:48.181 --> 40:50.150
- THIS IS SO [bleep] THAT
YOU'RE DOING THIS RIGHT NOW.

40:50.183 --> 40:51.151
- RYAN, I'M NOT HERE TO FIGHT,

40:51.184 --> 40:52.519
AND ESPECIALLY NOT
IN FRONT OF YOU.

40:52.552 --> 40:53.853
I JUST WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND.

40:53.887 --> 40:57.257
LIKE, IT WAS SO BAD.

40:57.290 --> 40:59.526
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE,
LIKE, AN OPPONENT, AN ENEMY,

40:59.559 --> 41:01.061
LIKE, A DARK FORCE.
- NO, IT'S JUST BUSINESS.

41:01.061 --> 41:03.396
- IT'S NOT BUSINESS, RYAN.
- SURE IT IS.

41:03.430 --> 41:04.531
TODAY'S A NEW DAY.
- IT WAS BUSINESS.

41:04.564 --> 41:07.600
YOU TOOK IT
TO A WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL.

41:07.634 --> 41:09.502
- WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?
- I PUSHED--I PUSHED BUTTONS.

41:09.536 --> 41:11.671
I PUSHED BUTTONS
TO MAKE HIM UPSET, YES.

41:11.705 --> 41:13.173
- SO YOU PROVOKED HIM?
- I HAD FUN.

41:13.206 --> 41:14.674
YES, I PROVOKED HIM.
YES.

41:14.708 --> 41:16.876
WHAT HE DID, 'CAUSE YOU WEREN'T
THERE, WAS VERY DIFFERENT.

41:16.910 --> 41:18.712
- WE HAD ONE DEAL
THAT I THOUGHT WENT BAD,

41:18.745 --> 41:20.547
SO MAYBE I OVERREACTED.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

41:20.580 --> 41:21.781
DO YOU WANT ME TO CRY
IN FRONT OF YOU?

41:21.815 --> 41:22.982
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
- NO, RYAN, I HAVE FEE--

41:23.083 --> 41:24.451
I'M A HUMAN BEING.
I CRY.

41:24.484 --> 41:26.486
DON'T YOU GET IT?

41:29.422 --> 41:32.492
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU HURT ME.

41:35.729 --> 41:37.197
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

41:37.230 --> 41:38.631
- IT WAS THE MOST HUMILIATING
THING ANYONE'S EVER DONE TO ME,

41:38.665 --> 41:39.933
AND I DON'T FEEL
LIKE I DESERVED IT.

41:39.966 --> 41:41.701
- THIS DOES NOT PHASE ME.

41:41.735 --> 41:44.104
FREDRIK DOES WHAT HE WANTS
WHENEVER HE WANTS

41:44.137 --> 41:47.173
ALL OVER TOWN, AND THEN AS SOON
AS SOMEONE JUST FIGHTS BACK

41:47.207 --> 41:50.543
JUST A LITTLE BIT,
HE "FAKE CRIES" ABOUT IT.

41:54.347 --> 41:55.682
- I'M BEING VULNERABLE
IN FRONT OF HIM,

41:55.715 --> 42:00.286
IN FRONT OF THE PERSON
WHO DID THIS TO ME.

42:00.320 --> 42:03.790
THERE'S, LIKE, NOTHING.

42:04.924 --> 42:07.494
ANYWAYS, THANKS FOR LISTENING.

42:07.527 --> 42:08.695
I MEAN IT.
- ABSOLUTELY.

42:08.728 --> 42:13.099
ANY TIME.

42:13.133 --> 42:14.601
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?
FREDRIK?

42:14.634 --> 42:18.338
- NOW I KNOW
RYAN HASN'T CHANGED AT ALL.

42:20.206 --> 42:21.908
- DO YOU THINK
HE'S MANIPULATIVE?

42:21.941 --> 42:24.544
- A LITTLE.
THE JURY'S STILL OUT.

42:24.577 --> 42:27.447

TO THE FACE OF BABY JESUS.
