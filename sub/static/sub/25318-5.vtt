01:18.130 --> 01:20.263
It's not gonna work.

01:20.610 --> 01:21.707
You're joking.

01:21.732 --> 01:22.897
I wish I was.

01:22.922 --> 01:25.098
- Something's off.
- What?

01:25.725 --> 01:27.338
No idea, I'd need to dismantle it.

01:27.363 --> 01:28.631
Disman...

01:28.922 --> 01:30.652
Jack, we just finished building it.

01:30.677 --> 01:33.179
We didn't build it at all.
That's the problem.

01:33.251 --> 01:35.835
We all signed off on the plans,
even Mesulam.

01:35.969 --> 01:38.282
I'm not talking about the plans,
I'm talking about this.

01:38.307 --> 01:39.441
The actual motor.

01:39.579 --> 01:42.195
We have all worked very hard
to get to this prototype,

01:42.469 --> 01:44.213
which may very well be

01:44.238 --> 01:46.736
the last chance we have
to validate our work.

01:49.843 --> 01:52.810
With all that's at stake,
maybe you're...

01:53.546 --> 01:54.814
Maybe I'm what?

01:55.187 --> 01:57.228
Buckling, a little.

01:59.593 --> 02:02.793
How many years have
we known each other?

02:03.362 --> 02:04.839
- Fifteen.
- And in all those years,

02:04.864 --> 02:07.229
When have you ever seen me "buckle"?

02:07.880 --> 02:10.383
I've never seen you show caution,

02:10.616 --> 02:14.308
which is itself cause for concern.

02:14.667 --> 02:18.595
Not for the rocket motor, but for you.

02:20.947 --> 02:23.516
Maybe the pressure is getting to you.

02:27.220 --> 02:28.521
Hey, Jack, where are you going?

02:28.633 --> 02:31.280
That's not a rocket, it's a bomb.

02:32.186 --> 02:33.793
If you don't want
to listen to me, fine.

02:33.818 --> 02:36.257
But I'm not gonna be around
when it goes off.

03:00.519 --> 03:02.515
Everything okay?

03:04.116 --> 03:06.718
Dinner's almost ready, if
you want to get cleaned up.

03:13.291 --> 03:14.827
I thought the prototype was finished.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.863
I thought so, too.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.611
Is Richard second-guessing something?

03:19.636 --> 03:21.504
No. This time, I'm the one
who's second-guessing.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.457
I just can't kick this feeling

03:23.482 --> 03:25.584
that the whole damn thing
is gonna blow apart.

03:25.725 --> 03:27.994
And guess who they'll
scapegoat if it does?

03:28.677 --> 03:29.884
Let me see.

03:29.909 --> 03:32.177
Do we blame the math,
which all checks out?

03:32.202 --> 03:34.504
Or do we blame the highly
combustible fuel?

03:35.390 --> 03:37.550
- That doesn't seem fair.
- Well, they're a part of the club.

03:37.575 --> 03:38.810
And I'm not.

03:43.304 --> 03:44.744
It can't be easy,

03:45.190 --> 03:47.493
always having to prove that you belong.

03:48.217 --> 03:49.644
But don't let Richard or any of them

03:49.669 --> 03:51.337
shake your faith.

03:58.936 --> 04:00.974
Why don't you take a break?

04:01.549 --> 04:03.062
Sometimes when you
stop looking so hard,

04:03.087 --> 04:04.522
that's when you find it.

04:08.332 --> 04:10.922
Parsons, come out here.

04:14.268 --> 04:16.834
Oh, good. Glad we caught you.

04:16.916 --> 04:19.584
I hope we're not interrupting anything,

04:20.093 --> 04:22.629
but we wanted to ask you something.

04:22.864 --> 04:25.615
Well, Ernest is taking me
camping this weekend,

04:25.640 --> 04:27.175
out in Joshua Tree.

04:27.252 --> 04:30.356
We were wondering if
you would maybe join us?

04:31.158 --> 04:33.418
Figured Maggie's
new to the neighborhood,

04:33.485 --> 04:34.951
thought it'd be nice for her
to make some new friends.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.577
Yes, and as far as I'm concerned,

04:36.602 --> 04:38.337
you're the only ones worth knowing.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.681
That's very kind of you, uh,

04:41.814 --> 04:45.051
but we don't have the right
clothing, or equipment.

04:45.172 --> 04:47.232
Oh, we have extras of everything.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.680
I mean, Ernest practically
grew up in the woods.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.724
Well, she left out the best part.

04:51.841 --> 04:53.593
We're off to find one of the world's

04:53.618 --> 04:54.986
- natural wonders.
- Mm.

04:55.028 --> 04:57.977
A moonflower called
the queen of the night.

04:58.091 --> 05:00.894
Blooms for one night only,
every three years.

05:00.952 --> 05:03.264
Wilts as soon as the sun comes up.

05:03.370 --> 05:05.118
I've never heard
of something like that.

05:05.171 --> 05:07.674
Oh, you'd have to see it to believe it.

05:08.012 --> 05:09.342
It sounds lovely,

05:09.367 --> 05:11.010
really, uh...

05:11.234 --> 05:13.546
Unfortunately, Jack has to work.

05:13.775 --> 05:16.549
Weren't you just saying
I could use a break?

05:16.959 --> 05:18.376
So it's settled, then.

05:18.424 --> 05:19.792
You'll come?

05:28.650 --> 05:30.792
Don't worry, I won't let
the coyotes get you.

05:32.574 --> 05:34.725
His bark is worse than his bite.

05:36.230 --> 05:38.634
I promised our life
would never be boring.

05:46.303 --> 05:47.838
Off we go!

05:48.504 --> 05:50.538
Reminds me of our first time.

07:33.194 --> 07:35.263
Are we all sleeping in that?

07:35.384 --> 07:38.867
Yep, packing in there
like a can of sardines.

07:39.132 --> 07:40.634
I'm just teasing.

07:40.659 --> 07:42.862
We brought a spare one
for the two of you.

07:48.049 --> 07:49.486
Thanks.

07:54.202 --> 07:56.215
You ever used one of these?

07:56.671 --> 07:58.175
Yeah. Course.

07:58.339 --> 08:00.341
Grab the bullets and the beer.

08:06.600 --> 08:09.350
Ah. Boys will be boys.

08:09.437 --> 08:12.039
Now do you see
why I'm so glad you came?

08:14.655 --> 08:16.557
You ever peel a potato
with a jackknife?

08:17.137 --> 08:18.783
There's a first time for everything.

08:18.846 --> 08:20.680
So you use your thumb as a stopper,

08:20.705 --> 08:23.133
and peel away from yourself
so you don't get hurt.

08:30.693 --> 08:32.974
Be careful!

08:34.067 --> 08:36.811
We really gonna spend all night
looking for a flower?

08:36.864 --> 08:39.066
Why? You have something else in mind?

08:40.666 --> 08:42.668
Let's see what you got.

08:56.449 --> 08:59.186
Your daddy didn't teach
you shooting, huh?

09:00.800 --> 09:02.273
He didn't teach you camping, either.

09:02.298 --> 09:03.953
He didn't do a lot of things.

09:04.031 --> 09:06.200
Well, if you can fire a rocket,
this'll be a cinch.

09:06.225 --> 09:07.683
Just fix your feet first.

09:07.717 --> 09:08.852
Let's get that back there.

09:08.877 --> 09:11.813
Now.

09:12.440 --> 09:14.119
Get it up high so you can see
down the sights.

09:14.144 --> 09:15.712
Come down on it.

09:16.010 --> 09:17.833
Now clear your mind,
and I want you to picture

09:17.858 --> 09:19.809
something you want to obliterate.

09:19.934 --> 09:22.904
Caltech, or that tight-ass Richard.

09:23.050 --> 09:24.185
All of the above.

09:24.210 --> 09:26.012
That a boy. Now,

09:26.053 --> 09:28.348
focus all your frustration
on that bottle,

09:28.522 --> 09:31.425
and when you're ready,
squeeze the trigger.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.883
There you go, you're a natural.

09:39.974 --> 09:42.133
So what exactly are we looking for?

09:42.196 --> 09:44.031
Anything that looks like a cactus

09:44.056 --> 09:45.707
that has something sticking out of it.

09:45.834 --> 09:47.458
- Oh...
- Whoa.

09:47.483 --> 09:49.811
You okay?

09:50.084 --> 09:51.641
Are those the best shoes you have?

09:51.666 --> 09:54.435
Says you, city boy,
in your vest and trousers.

09:54.615 --> 09:57.285
Yeah, it was either
these or Mary Janes.

10:01.117 --> 10:02.329
Here.

10:02.376 --> 10:03.560
Till you get your sea legs.

10:03.585 --> 10:04.747
Oh, thanks.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.777
He can be charming when he wants to be.

10:07.545 --> 10:08.745
Come on, hurry up.

10:08.770 --> 10:10.560
Before it gets dark.

10:48.521 --> 10:51.424
Where are you,
you night-blooming bastard?

10:51.505 --> 10:53.406
Show yourself!

10:53.481 --> 10:54.743
I'm sorry, but the queen

10:54.768 --> 10:56.203
is gonna have to come to us.

10:56.583 --> 10:58.220
My feet are through.

10:58.245 --> 10:59.313
Who needs flowers

10:59.338 --> 11:01.040
when you have grapes?

11:01.384 --> 11:04.352
Oh, no, we're giving up already?

11:04.897 --> 11:06.865
Ernest and I might have
to keep looking.

11:06.921 --> 11:08.122
Eh, what's the rush?

11:08.147 --> 11:09.816
We have all night.

11:11.075 --> 11:12.239
Here you go, Jack.

11:12.264 --> 11:14.133
Don't go conking out on me.

11:21.028 --> 11:22.761
I could never pull off that shade.

11:22.830 --> 11:25.834
Are you kidding? With those lips?

11:26.773 --> 11:27.975
Come closer.

11:28.132 --> 11:29.618
Uh, I'm okay.

11:29.677 --> 11:31.679
Who do you got to be embarrassed
in front of?

11:31.833 --> 11:33.468
It's just us out here.

11:37.622 --> 11:38.802
Bum a smoke, Jack?

11:38.827 --> 11:40.270
Yeah, sure.

11:44.271 --> 11:45.974
VoilÃ .

11:47.117 --> 11:48.650
See?

11:50.003 --> 11:53.211
Ernest calls it "bull's-eye red."

11:55.602 --> 11:57.838
You and he seem so well-suited.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.436
We have our moments.

12:00.143 --> 12:03.097
Say, how did you meet that
handsome husband of yours?

12:03.122 --> 12:04.769
It all happened at a little...

12:04.825 --> 12:07.253
Little something to make
the evening more interesting.

12:08.126 --> 12:09.619
I knew it.

12:09.696 --> 12:12.199
"Moonflower."

12:12.313 --> 12:13.898
I didn't take you for a botanist.

12:13.923 --> 12:15.891
All right, genius,
keep your voice down.

12:15.964 --> 12:18.488
Take three sips exactly.

12:22.750 --> 12:25.219
What the hell is that?

12:25.637 --> 12:27.519
Medicine. It'll cure what ails you.

12:27.775 --> 12:29.256
Go on, take two more.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.813
You don't want me to beat you
to the punch, do you?

12:37.632 --> 12:38.833
Oh, shit.

12:38.886 --> 12:41.032
Here we go.

12:41.669 --> 12:46.267
Jack, honey, what was
the name of that song?

12:46.487 --> 12:48.674
You know, the first one
we ever danced to?

12:50.653 --> 12:53.229
You checking to see
if I still remember?

12:56.590 --> 12:58.459
My Lord.

13:02.583 --> 13:04.066
Well...

13:04.091 --> 13:06.094
Let me set the scene a little.

13:06.507 --> 13:09.642
Spring dance. Pine Brook Lodge.

13:10.711 --> 13:14.445
A girl not much more than 20.

13:14.789 --> 13:16.622
A boy with stars in his eyes.

13:18.592 --> 13:21.421
Well, you still haven't
told us the name of the song.

13:35.082 --> 13:36.784
On it.

14:25.677 --> 14:28.634
- Where'd you learn how to do that?
- Vaudeville circuit.

14:28.726 --> 14:30.072
She was a song n' dance girl,

14:30.096 --> 14:31.959
see, the finest one I ever saw.

14:33.246 --> 14:35.756
And he was the sexiest
stagehand there was.

14:35.870 --> 14:37.405
Followed us all the way West.

14:37.430 --> 14:39.966
Well, it was her I followed.

14:40.728 --> 14:42.337
Do you know this next part?

14:43.665 --> 14:45.279
- Uh...
- She's just shy.

14:45.319 --> 14:46.887
She has a beautiful voice.

15:05.512 --> 15:07.715
You should hear her at the church.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.542
She's the angel of the choir.

15:12.223 --> 15:14.408
May I have this dance?

16:41.729 --> 16:43.497
Shh.

17:49.335 --> 17:50.703
I'll protect you.

18:09.483 --> 18:11.643
What was in that flask?

18:12.098 --> 18:14.449
Do you speak Nahuatl?

18:14.768 --> 18:16.516
I don't think so.

18:16.697 --> 18:19.401
The Nahuatl word for "divine messenger"

18:19.426 --> 18:21.094
is peyote.

18:21.729 --> 18:24.682
Tonight, we strip ourselves
of all that we are not,

18:24.719 --> 18:26.911
so we may see what we are:

18:27.088 --> 18:30.843
water, earth, air, fire.

18:31.189 --> 18:34.515
What everything in the universe
is made of.

18:35.196 --> 18:37.013
I thought everything was made of atoms.

18:37.038 --> 18:38.641
Forget everything you know.

18:39.061 --> 18:40.514
There are four elements,

18:40.539 --> 18:42.615
each opposite balances the other.

18:42.730 --> 18:44.075
Air erodes earth.

18:44.198 --> 18:46.033
Earth contains air.

18:46.058 --> 18:47.927
Water quenches fire.

18:48.015 --> 18:50.050
And fire boils water.

18:53.920 --> 18:55.222
Are you hot?

18:55.247 --> 18:56.547
Focus, Jack.

18:56.572 --> 18:58.977
- I can't breathe.
- Focus, damn it.

18:59.946 --> 19:02.249
You're not anyone's property.

19:02.835 --> 19:06.075
Nobody's husband. Not an employee.

19:06.213 --> 19:07.917
Not Jack Parsons.

19:07.948 --> 19:10.984
Not a scientist, not even a man.

19:11.039 --> 19:13.341
You are a beast.

19:13.406 --> 19:16.076
And a beast knows no bounds.

19:25.639 --> 19:27.875
Good. You're purging.

19:37.531 --> 19:39.032
It's me, Jack.

19:39.113 --> 19:40.364
Don't come any closer.

19:40.437 --> 19:41.618
Jack...

19:41.683 --> 19:44.922
No. No. Stay away!

19:47.308 --> 19:48.562
Jack.

19:53.586 --> 19:55.488
Jack!

19:56.943 --> 19:59.346
<i> How many miles to Babylon?</i>

19:59.399 --> 20:00.955
<i>Three score and ten.</i>

20:01.214 --> 20:02.749
<i>Can I get there by candlelight?</i>

20:02.916 --> 20:05.318
<i>Yes, and back again.</i>

21:07.968 --> 21:09.481
This...

21:10.097 --> 21:12.775
is the great horror,

21:13.974 --> 21:16.175
loneliness.

21:17.731 --> 21:21.768
It is like the scorpion
striking itself.

21:53.006 --> 21:56.410
Have you seen my elemental?

22:04.578 --> 22:06.253
Thanks, friend.

22:32.346 --> 22:33.792
You made it.

22:37.931 --> 22:39.792
Who are you?

22:39.851 --> 22:41.989
I'll give you a hint.

22:42.088 --> 22:44.090
I know who you are.

22:44.871 --> 22:47.674
You're Jack M. Parsons.

22:48.123 --> 22:51.506
The M stands for Marvel.

22:54.501 --> 22:56.470
How'd you know that?

22:56.583 --> 22:58.618
Because it's my name, too.

22:59.695 --> 23:01.341
Dad?

23:03.344 --> 23:04.544
Fetch, boy!

23:11.198 --> 23:13.066
Where have you been?

23:13.279 --> 23:15.289
Up here, waiting.

23:16.177 --> 23:17.891
For what?

23:18.031 --> 23:19.797
For you.

23:23.697 --> 23:25.866
Are you saying you've spent
the last 20 years

23:25.891 --> 23:27.792
waiting for me on the Moon?

23:28.168 --> 23:32.055
Well, not the entire time.

23:34.507 --> 23:36.943
Did some soldiering for a while.

23:37.441 --> 23:41.188
Spent years chasing
Pancho Villa back to Mexico.

23:41.361 --> 23:43.430
Then I made my way up here.

23:44.130 --> 23:46.666
Took a while, as you can imagine.

23:49.056 --> 23:51.258
I knew you must have been
doing incredible things.

23:52.899 --> 23:55.196
Like father like son.

23:56.723 --> 23:59.131
But how'd you get up here?

23:59.885 --> 24:01.721
That's the best part.

24:01.835 --> 24:04.905
Come on, I'll show you.

24:16.483 --> 24:17.835
90.

24:17.945 --> 24:20.781
91, 92...

24:21.654 --> 24:23.731
93...

24:31.164 --> 24:33.414
You.

24:33.917 --> 24:37.757
_

24:37.904 --> 24:42.242
Ha! You call yourself the Grand Magus?

24:42.717 --> 24:44.686
If you're so fucking grand,

24:44.711 --> 24:47.027
put your hands down, fight like a man.

24:47.115 --> 24:49.088
_

24:49.142 --> 24:50.781
Down, I said!

24:50.998 --> 24:52.430
You're no mage!

24:52.455 --> 24:53.857
You're a rat-faced liar!

24:53.882 --> 24:55.477
Me and Maggie was working things
out and you had to go

24:55.501 --> 24:58.336
and put those fucking ideas in my head!

24:58.361 --> 25:00.196
Huh?

25:00.247 --> 25:02.282
Ow!

25:02.641 --> 25:04.643
Shit!

25:06.606 --> 25:08.252
Ow!

25:08.328 --> 25:10.364
Goddamn it!

25:13.209 --> 25:15.503
_

25:17.565 --> 25:19.469
Yeah?

25:20.440 --> 25:22.442
You mean it?

25:26.031 --> 25:28.567
Well, I'm sorry, too.

25:49.288 --> 25:51.712
I'm really glad I ran into you.

25:51.819 --> 25:53.687
There's something
I've been wanting to ask.

25:53.980 --> 25:55.478
You got a light, son?

25:55.541 --> 25:56.709
Yeah.

25:58.104 --> 26:00.171
I'd wondered where that got to.

26:00.246 --> 26:02.764
Glad to know it's been
in good hands all these years.

26:06.511 --> 26:09.196
There's no oxygen up here
to feed the flame.

26:18.165 --> 26:20.867
Now, what were you saying?

26:21.088 --> 26:23.423
Ah. You wanted to ask me something.

26:23.577 --> 26:25.279
Spit it out.

26:25.539 --> 26:27.447
I've been having this dream.

26:27.611 --> 26:28.859
Mm-hmm?

26:28.884 --> 26:31.153
Now I'm starting to think maybe
it wasn't a dream at all.

26:31.551 --> 26:33.772
I was about six.

26:34.087 --> 26:36.389
And you and me stayed up,
playing a game.

26:36.414 --> 26:38.850
"How many miles to Babylon," remember?

26:39.241 --> 26:40.374
No.

26:40.399 --> 26:42.469
I was trying to summon the Devil.

26:43.616 --> 26:45.087
Well, is that so?

26:45.112 --> 26:46.580
Did you?

26:46.707 --> 26:48.108
You really don't remember?

26:48.355 --> 26:49.620
I don't. I'm sorry.

26:49.645 --> 26:51.513
You must. I was on the floor,

26:51.673 --> 26:53.980
and you came into the room
wearing a devil's mask.

26:54.005 --> 26:55.840
You scared me half to death.

26:55.915 --> 26:58.302
I don't think so.

26:59.112 --> 27:00.594
It had to have been you.

27:00.736 --> 27:03.261
Jack, I may be a son of a bitch,

27:03.286 --> 27:05.121
but I'll be damned
if I was ever the Devil.

27:06.268 --> 27:07.848
Don't you see?

27:08.073 --> 27:09.694
It was you.

27:09.996 --> 27:13.199
You're a Marvel, just like me.

27:13.339 --> 27:15.345
And you could summon the Devil

27:15.370 --> 27:17.906
sure as you could conquer the Moon.

27:18.578 --> 27:22.048
Now come on, we're almost there.

27:27.107 --> 27:28.942
Dad?

27:34.514 --> 27:36.516
Dad?

27:40.313 --> 27:41.881
Dad!

28:06.620 --> 28:08.622
Hello?

28:13.320 --> 28:15.322
Dad?

28:25.111 --> 28:27.113
Dad?

29:41.053 --> 29:43.055
Jack!

29:47.747 --> 29:49.727
You did this.

29:49.909 --> 29:51.978
You.

31:03.690 --> 31:05.592
Get out!

31:06.296 --> 31:08.056
I've been looking all over for you.

31:08.081 --> 31:10.551
You've been looking for me?

31:10.930 --> 31:12.899
I broke through, Ernest.

31:13.069 --> 31:14.734
Just like you said: no bounds.

31:14.768 --> 31:16.469
I saw it all, everything.

31:16.817 --> 31:19.672
I drew it, so I wouldn't forget.

31:20.059 --> 31:21.627
Look.

31:22.137 --> 31:23.964
- Who's that?
- That's not important.

31:23.989 --> 31:25.257
This is what's important.

31:25.404 --> 31:27.049
This is the future.

31:27.200 --> 31:29.302
The future that I'm gonna build.

31:30.709 --> 31:32.479
You were right.

31:32.552 --> 31:35.288
Strip away all that we aren't,
and we see what we are.

31:35.629 --> 31:37.411
I'd begun to lose sight.

31:38.291 --> 31:41.861
Thank you, it's the best gift
anyone's ever given me.

31:57.536 --> 31:59.505
Where's Jack and Ernest?

31:59.893 --> 32:03.236
Probably out looking for
that damn moonflower.

32:04.160 --> 32:05.819
Why didn't they wake us?

32:05.970 --> 32:07.750
You said your feet were hurting.

32:07.901 --> 32:09.292
You could've gone.

32:09.715 --> 32:11.463
I think that was the point.

32:11.557 --> 32:13.726
They didn't want
either one of us to come.

32:13.993 --> 32:15.695
Why?

32:19.159 --> 32:21.500
You're really not worried?

32:21.767 --> 32:23.769
Ernest has always been like this.

32:23.856 --> 32:26.031
Restless, and...

32:26.985 --> 32:28.664
Capricious?

32:30.302 --> 32:31.904
Well, yes.

32:32.232 --> 32:33.946
When he sets his sights on something,

32:33.971 --> 32:36.716
he goes after it and doesn't
give up until he gets it.

32:37.553 --> 32:39.128
And when that thing is you,

32:39.185 --> 32:42.455
it makes you feel like the most
important person on Earth.

32:43.528 --> 32:45.981
I know what you mean.

32:52.632 --> 32:56.463
I guess that's why you're okay
with all the other stuff, too.

32:57.058 --> 32:58.705
What other stuff?

32:58.804 --> 33:00.707
You know.

33:01.446 --> 33:03.582
His group.

33:05.050 --> 33:06.752
You know about that?

33:07.494 --> 33:09.211
He took us.

33:11.570 --> 33:13.968
I assumed he would've told you.

33:17.176 --> 33:19.211
Needless to say, it wasn't for us.

33:23.449 --> 33:27.086
Took all night,
but we finally found one.

33:33.499 --> 33:35.568
It was beautiful before dawn.

33:36.521 --> 33:38.704
I wish you'd been there.

33:45.632 --> 33:46.935
I think that's everything.

33:46.999 --> 33:48.698
Should be.

33:56.429 --> 33:57.823
You okay?

33:57.878 --> 33:59.545
Never been better.

34:11.878 --> 34:14.681
Until we meet again, tree!

34:36.936 --> 34:39.268
Feels wrong doing this
without Jack here.

34:39.406 --> 34:41.373
Jack said he didn't want to be here.

34:41.420 --> 34:43.556
- I know.
- Gentlemen.

34:43.621 --> 34:45.492
It seems your prototype

34:45.516 --> 34:47.860
has sparked much interest on campus.

34:49.641 --> 34:50.840
Richard.

34:52.484 --> 34:55.257
Are we waiting for your
illustrious colleague?

34:55.425 --> 34:58.491
Um... not exactly.

34:58.637 --> 35:01.306
Well, stop keeping us
in suspense, Mr. Onsted.

35:01.331 --> 35:02.962
The Department of War
has graciously sent

35:02.996 --> 35:04.530
General Braxton back to campus

35:04.564 --> 35:05.932
to see how our research groups

35:05.965 --> 35:07.712
are advancing.

35:08.327 --> 35:10.930
Professor Tillman's propeller
group was quite impressive.

35:11.137 --> 35:13.840
Excited to see what you boys are up to.

35:19.846 --> 35:22.048
Gentlemen, let's move back, please.

35:27.173 --> 35:29.168
Good afternoon.

35:30.622 --> 35:35.160
This is a very unexpected,
but very welcome, surprise.

35:35.415 --> 35:37.797
And opportunity.

35:38.448 --> 35:41.231
We're very excited and
very honored to share with you

35:41.256 --> 35:43.858
the first test firing
of our newly built rocket motor,

35:43.883 --> 35:46.018
the GALCIT 1.

35:46.973 --> 35:48.502
We hope...

35:49.108 --> 35:51.419
Sorry, we-we know...

35:51.611 --> 35:53.769
that this prototype
will show that rocketry

35:53.794 --> 35:57.331
deserves recognition and support

35:57.550 --> 35:59.721
as a legitimate science.

36:00.637 --> 36:01.838
Thank you.

36:04.223 --> 36:06.959
General, if you would.

36:17.002 --> 36:19.037
On your signal.

36:22.256 --> 36:23.895
Go ahead.

36:24.176 --> 36:25.977
No. Wait.

36:27.180 --> 36:29.447
He did call it a bomb before he left.

36:29.556 --> 36:31.791
Richard.

36:36.358 --> 36:37.838
No, you're right.

36:38.184 --> 36:41.053
Math checks out. It's not a bomb.

36:42.628 --> 36:44.030
Proceed.

37:03.442 --> 37:04.910
We weren't wrong.

37:05.118 --> 37:07.954
Sometimes crazy is just crazy.

37:08.087 --> 37:10.056
You want to try for the full minute?

37:24.740 --> 37:26.875
<i>Germany and Italy still have</i>

37:26.900 --> 37:28.007
<i>the Pact of Steel,</i>

37:28.040 --> 37:31.043
<i>initially drafted as an alliance
between Japan,</i>

37:31.077 --> 37:32.845
<i>Italy and Germany...</i>

38:05.444 --> 38:07.780
Good time, huh?

38:11.884 --> 38:13.619
What's wrong?

38:21.641 --> 38:23.961
You upset 'cause we were out all night?

38:27.426 --> 38:30.791
Thought we agreed we wouldn't
act this way anymore.

38:31.725 --> 38:34.461
Act what way?

38:35.252 --> 38:36.850
Needy.

38:37.043 --> 38:40.079
No, you're absolutely right.

38:40.213 --> 38:43.783
We agreed there would be
no limitations,

38:44.217 --> 38:46.219
as long as you told me the truth.

38:47.542 --> 38:49.885
What did I lie about exactly?

38:50.015 --> 38:52.050
This trip was never about
making new friends

38:52.075 --> 38:54.349
or spending time with me.

38:54.533 --> 38:57.837
It was all part of some
goddamn recruitment.

38:59.866 --> 39:03.136
Susan told me you had taken them.

39:03.550 --> 39:04.983
Guess you've given up on her,

39:05.008 --> 39:06.312
but him...

39:06.337 --> 39:07.801
he still has some promise.

39:09.272 --> 39:11.043
Congratulations.

39:11.232 --> 39:13.473
You'll be moving up
to the next degree in no time.

39:13.507 --> 39:14.627
This is why.

39:14.652 --> 39:16.821
If I told you the truth,
you wouldn't have gone.

39:18.490 --> 39:20.720
Did you even want me there?

39:20.872 --> 39:23.134
Of course.

39:24.269 --> 39:25.939
Oh...

39:26.333 --> 39:28.728
Because if I didn't go,
then Susan wouldn't have gone.

39:28.761 --> 39:30.183
And then she wouldn't have let him.

39:30.208 --> 39:32.285
It's not that at all.

39:32.365 --> 39:34.788
I wanted you there, too.

39:34.906 --> 39:36.419
I wanted all of it.

39:36.550 --> 39:37.618
Of course you did because

39:37.643 --> 39:38.824
you never want to have to choose.

39:38.856 --> 39:40.392
You said, when you came back here,

39:40.417 --> 39:41.516
you were gonna try and accept it.

39:41.541 --> 39:43.309
I do accept it, Ernest,

39:43.622 --> 39:45.710
but when you tell me we're going
camping with the neighbors,

39:45.735 --> 39:48.771
I want to believe
we're just going camping.

39:50.802 --> 39:52.971
You've already scared away
most of our old friends,

39:53.005 --> 39:55.574
do we have to scare away
the new ones, too?

40:04.230 --> 40:06.005
Why do you think

40:06.766 --> 40:09.144
a man like Jack

40:10.089 --> 40:13.001
wants to be friends with a man like me?

40:15.988 --> 40:19.121
Thelema's the only thing
I have to offer.

40:27.253 --> 40:29.121
Is that what you really think?

40:29.259 --> 40:32.053
I think you came back here

40:32.586 --> 40:34.539
hoping to bring me to my senses.

40:34.679 --> 40:36.214
No.

40:36.596 --> 40:38.397
I told you I'm okay with it.

40:39.097 --> 40:41.171
I don't believe you.

40:43.322 --> 40:45.424
What do I have to do to prove it?

41:04.476 --> 41:06.345
Excuse me.

41:12.077 --> 41:13.648
Take a bow.

41:13.713 --> 41:15.432
You were right.

41:17.503 --> 41:21.340
I kept trying to call you, all weekend,

41:21.374 --> 41:24.836
but it's as if you had vanished
from the face of the earth.

41:25.017 --> 41:29.955
I did, as a matter of fact.
I went camping.

41:32.303 --> 41:36.140
Well done. You got as far away
as you could.

41:38.053 --> 41:40.126
What was the glitch?

41:42.490 --> 41:43.692
That's it?

41:43.717 --> 41:45.010
What's it?

41:45.063 --> 41:47.747
You're not gonna let me have it?

41:47.880 --> 41:50.378
Call me an imbecile
for doing a test fire

41:50.403 --> 41:52.238
when you explicitly told me not to?

41:52.491 --> 41:54.360
No.

41:55.908 --> 41:57.820
So what made it blow?

41:58.566 --> 42:00.212
Hubris.

42:00.542 --> 42:03.115
And things were going so well at first,

42:03.670 --> 42:05.918
I decided to try for the full minute.

42:05.951 --> 42:08.521
We got to 46 seconds, and then...

42:08.772 --> 42:11.197
everything went up in smoke.

42:12.424 --> 42:16.820
The engine, our credibility,
our future.

42:20.565 --> 42:23.067
This missed Tillman by an inch.

42:24.970 --> 42:27.184
Pity it missed.

42:29.434 --> 42:31.738
How did you know, Jack?

42:32.198 --> 42:35.267
What did you see that we didn't?

42:35.774 --> 42:38.376
I didn't see it, I felt it.

42:38.557 --> 42:41.075
There was something
none of us had thought of.

42:41.273 --> 42:42.939
Something no one's ever thought of.

42:43.015 --> 42:45.751
Because the problem
didn't exist until now.

42:49.147 --> 42:51.383
But the good news is,

42:51.530 --> 42:53.808
if I was right about that,

42:55.194 --> 42:57.723
then I'm also right
about something else.

43:01.941 --> 43:04.317
We're gonna change the world, Rich.

43:04.683 --> 43:07.719
We just have 51 more prototypes to go.

43:10.781 --> 43:12.595
- How do you know?
- I just do.

43:12.620 --> 43:14.335
Maybe you'll take my
word for it this time.

43:14.379 --> 43:16.385
Jack, you don't get it.

43:16.951 --> 43:18.515
This was our chance...

43:18.765 --> 43:20.122
to get funding,

43:20.171 --> 43:22.474
real funding, and I blew it.

43:22.628 --> 43:24.463
We'll build another motor.
We'll run another test...

43:24.497 --> 43:26.465
- Where?
- What do you mean where?

43:26.532 --> 43:29.001
We've been kicked off campus.

43:33.125 --> 43:35.963
You're right, world is changing.

43:37.803 --> 43:40.544
I doubt that we'll have
anything to do with it.

44:04.604 --> 44:05.872
This way.
