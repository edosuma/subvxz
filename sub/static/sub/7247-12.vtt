00:00.157 --> 00:01.437
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

00:01.476 --> 00:02.476
What does that mean?

00:02.526 --> 00:04.309
<i>Jesus, we could not have screwed up</i>

00:04.311 --> 00:05.283
<i>that spell worse,
and we can't take it back.</i>

00:05.423 --> 00:07.006
<i>It's just you showed up
with that sigil on your hand.</i>

00:07.008 --> 00:08.768
<i>It appeared when I was
dreaming of Fillory.</i>

00:09.090 --> 00:11.273
- <i>It came from Jane.</i>
- Who are you?

00:11.393 --> 00:12.809
I'm a member of The Order,

00:12.811 --> 00:14.561
the keepers of the libraries
of the Neitherlands.

00:14.613 --> 00:15.979
Any idea who the motherfuckers
in the hoods are,

00:15.981 --> 00:17.147
<i>trying to kill me?</i>

00:17.199 --> 00:18.365
They've been thoroughly cursed,

00:18.400 --> 00:20.150
so they can't use the fountains,

00:20.202 --> 00:21.652
but that hasn't stopped them
from finding other employment.

00:21.654 --> 00:23.203
The Beast?

00:23.239 --> 00:25.038
We are the best Magicians we know,

00:25.074 --> 00:26.740
but Menolly is dying.

00:26.792 --> 00:28.408
Bender's trying to stay
off the ledge every day.

00:28.460 --> 00:29.493
And you?

00:29.495 --> 00:30.544
Eight years ago,

00:30.579 --> 00:31.878
I was a drug addict,

00:31.914 --> 00:36.500
and I left my son in a hot car.

00:36.552 --> 00:37.668
We're not learning anything new.

00:37.670 --> 00:39.002
Beast always kills us.

00:39.004 --> 00:40.837
There was one time
we didn't all die--

00:40.839 --> 00:42.170
when we went to Fillory.

00:42.290 --> 00:43.840
<i>Point is, we need
some serious battle magic.</i>

00:43.842 --> 00:45.676
Bottling our emotions...

00:45.678 --> 00:47.718
<i>When the feelings come back,
it's extremely intense.</i>

<i>Near the bridge, there's a man</i>

01:00.526 --> 01:02.693
who has served me a thousand years.

01:02.745 --> 01:06.530
Bring him three gifts.
He'll show you the way.

01:40.649 --> 01:43.066
Huh.
Not what I expected.

01:43.068 --> 01:44.651
Yeah.

01:46.155 --> 01:48.405
Die, fucker!

01:52.661 --> 01:54.494
Well, that sucked ass.

01:54.546 --> 01:57.581
Julia, Kady!

01:57.633 --> 02:00.083
Finally.
<i>Bienvenidas.</i>

02:00.135 --> 02:02.419
Are we interrupting or--

02:02.421 --> 02:04.588
Oh, no, no, no.
Just passing the time.

02:04.590 --> 02:05.756
So...

02:05.758 --> 02:07.924
Uh, yeah, um...

02:07.976 --> 02:10.092
We bring forsythia...

02:10.145 --> 02:11.845
Mm-hmm.

02:11.897 --> 02:14.681
And honeycomb.

02:14.733 --> 02:16.516
Hmm.

02:16.568 --> 02:18.652
Hmm-hmm-hmm.

02:18.687 --> 02:20.821
<i>Muy bien, chicas.</i>

02:20.856 --> 02:22.356
<i>Muy bien.</i>

02:22.408 --> 02:23.990
Two down.

02:24.026 --> 02:26.109
Where's the platinum?

02:26.111 --> 02:27.444
We didn't bring that.

02:27.496 --> 02:29.780
Too bad.
Exit through the gift shop.

02:29.782 --> 02:34.618
But we did bring something
of great and shining worth.

02:34.670 --> 02:36.953
Just say it.

02:36.955 --> 02:39.005
If you're wrong, you're wrong.

02:42.294 --> 02:46.129
We brought you our faith.

02:46.131 --> 02:48.131
Ooh.

02:48.133 --> 02:49.349
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

02:49.385 --> 02:53.136
Tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky.

02:53.138 --> 02:54.688
I like it.

02:54.723 --> 02:57.691
But to be honest,
I'm sensing more skepticism

02:57.726 --> 03:00.644
than faith here.

03:02.030 --> 03:05.399
Look, um, I'm trying.

03:05.451 --> 03:07.150
She's the one
that had the dream, okay?

03:07.202 --> 03:09.236
Hey.

03:09.288 --> 03:13.240
Kady, your mother used your faith,

03:13.292 --> 03:17.244
but she isn't your true mother.

03:17.296 --> 03:20.330
Our Lady feels you require a miracle.

03:33.061 --> 03:34.261
Oh, my God.

03:34.313 --> 03:36.012
Wha--what ha--

03:36.014 --> 03:37.347
What did he do?

03:37.399 --> 03:38.348
I don't--
I don't know.

03:38.400 --> 03:39.733
I've had this tightness

03:39.768 --> 03:43.687
ever since my mom, but it's gone.

03:43.739 --> 03:47.274
Ah, there it is.

03:48.944 --> 03:51.161
Faith.

03:53.115 --> 03:54.698
Okay, so...

03:55.701 --> 03:57.367
Let's get to brass.

03:57.369 --> 03:59.703
You're here why?

03:59.755 --> 04:02.539
We seek an audience
with Our Lady Underground.

04:02.541 --> 04:04.624
Yeah, no shit.

04:04.676 --> 04:07.761
Why do you think
you deserve to see her?

04:10.549 --> 04:12.299
- Hmm?
- It's okay.

04:12.351 --> 04:15.385
Why should she waste
her time with you?

04:15.387 --> 04:17.771
I am privileged,

04:17.805 --> 04:19.473
and I have done some stupid shit,

04:19.524 --> 04:21.274
and I have been through nothing

04:21.310 --> 04:22.893
compared to some of my friends.

04:22.895 --> 04:24.561
So you wish to help them?

04:24.563 --> 04:26.446
Heal them?
Is that it?

04:26.482 --> 04:29.733
Yes, that is exactly
what I want to do.

04:29.785 --> 04:32.068
No.

04:32.120 --> 04:33.320
No, no, no.

04:35.707 --> 04:37.657
Magicians...

04:37.709 --> 04:40.327
that's all you ever want,
power, every time.

04:42.381 --> 04:43.997
You know what?

04:44.049 --> 04:45.799
For the longest time,

04:45.834 --> 04:49.252
that is all I wanted.

04:49.254 --> 04:50.804
But now I just want to do

04:50.839 --> 04:52.973
whatever the fuck it is
I'm supposed to.

04:53.008 --> 04:56.142
And if she's around,
if she gives a shit,

04:56.178 --> 04:58.929
I have to believe
she wants her daughters

04:58.931 --> 05:02.265
to show a little ambition.

05:02.267 --> 05:07.654
So you tell her that I am trying

05:07.689 --> 05:10.106
to reach something higher.

05:10.108 --> 05:14.444
<i>Nuestra Señora</i> sits and waits,

05:14.446 --> 05:17.864
and no one asks.

05:17.916 --> 05:19.783
She watches.

05:19.785 --> 05:22.536
She weeps.

05:25.007 --> 05:27.290
But today, she's
grinning like a fool.

05:27.292 --> 05:29.676
Here's the invocation.

05:29.711 --> 05:32.629
May her blessings be with you.

05:32.681 --> 05:34.130
Thank you.

05:34.182 --> 05:36.716
And one more piece
of advice for the chosen.

05:39.304 --> 05:41.221
You can't unring a bell,

05:41.273 --> 05:44.808
so be certain when you call, Julia.

06:05.864 --> 06:08.131
Okay.

06:10.035 --> 06:12.335
Look...

06:17.092 --> 06:19.559
All y'all look like
you did a crime last night.

06:26.401 --> 06:28.685
According to all
the probability shit,

06:28.737 --> 06:30.403
we don't have time to wait.

06:30.439 --> 06:33.106
One or another super shitty ending

06:33.158 --> 06:35.408
is coming within days

06:35.444 --> 06:38.278
if we don't at least
try to go get the knife.

06:38.330 --> 06:40.330
So...

06:41.617 --> 06:43.366
Oh, God.

06:43.368 --> 06:47.203
The Neitherlands is Grand
Central for the multiverse.

06:47.205 --> 06:48.538
<i>The button will bring you in,</i>

06:48.540 --> 06:49.589
<i>and once you're there--</i>

06:49.625 --> 06:51.424
Yes, the fountains are portals.

06:51.460 --> 06:53.043
Can I say this?

06:53.095 --> 06:54.544
For your interest?

06:54.596 --> 06:56.262
As far as I know,

06:56.298 --> 06:57.964
you don't need a button or anything

06:58.016 --> 06:59.432
to ride the fountains,

06:59.468 --> 07:01.051
so don't fall in.

07:01.053 --> 07:02.385
Don't get lost.

07:02.437 --> 07:04.437
The whole place is crawling

07:04.473 --> 07:06.606
<i>with battle magic motherfuckers

07:06.642 --> 07:08.642
<i>We get separated,</i>

07:08.694 --> 07:10.060
you're dead.

Seriously,

07:11.980 --> 07:15.732
what the fuck is going on
with you people?

07:23.825 --> 07:26.826
Nothing.
We're fine, aren't we, El?

07:26.878 --> 07:28.244
We're phenomenal.

07:28.296 --> 07:30.747
Fine, okay.
We're not okay.

07:30.749 --> 07:32.415
Forget it.
We just need to--

07:32.467 --> 07:35.418
- We're going to--
- It's over!

07:35.470 --> 07:38.254
I need a minute.

07:38.306 --> 07:41.424
Alice is just a little bit
sensitive right now.

07:41.426 --> 07:42.809
Would you just shut
the fuck up, Margo?

07:42.844 --> 07:44.644
Are you seriously
mad at me right now?

07:44.680 --> 07:46.120
What the fuck did I just walk into?

07:46.148 --> 07:47.981
My life. Welcome.

07:48.016 --> 07:49.315
It's not funny, and it's not a joke.

07:49.351 --> 07:51.101
But it truly is, Quentin.

07:51.153 --> 07:52.769
You people need to stow your shit!

07:52.821 --> 07:54.320
We get it!

Super creepy.

08:31.026 --> 08:32.976
You didn't feel what I felt.

08:33.028 --> 08:34.811
I don't know.
Whatever he was channeling,

08:34.813 --> 08:36.696
it was the real deal.

08:36.732 --> 08:38.815
She's just nervous.

09:20.525 --> 09:22.358

Fair enough.

09:40.128 --> 09:41.128
It's not good.

09:41.179 --> 09:42.796
No, it's not good.

09:42.848 --> 09:45.131
Yeah.

09:45.183 --> 09:46.966
Let you in on
a little secret, though.

09:47.018 --> 09:50.720
I used to drink Midori
in high school.

09:50.722 --> 09:54.808
It's like melon crossed with perfume

09:54.860 --> 09:57.610
crossed with ass.

09:57.646 --> 09:58.728
Yum.

09:58.730 --> 10:00.730
Fuck did I know?

10:00.782 --> 10:04.234
I was trying to get
the voices to go away.

10:04.236 --> 10:08.621
Point is, I'm not judging
anyone for triple sec.

10:10.575 --> 10:13.243
And...

10:13.245 --> 10:16.629
I can tell when someone's trying
to make something go away.

10:19.217 --> 10:23.469
So Midori, hmm?

10:23.505 --> 10:25.471
Does it work?

10:25.507 --> 10:29.342
Nothing works forever.

10:29.394 --> 10:31.678
But, you know,

10:31.730 --> 10:35.682
if you stop worrying about forever,

10:35.734 --> 10:38.184
there's plenty of shit that can
get you through the next hour.

10:51.867 --> 10:54.450
Is what he said still bugging you?

10:54.502 --> 10:57.954
He looked at me like
he could see through me.

10:58.006 --> 11:01.207
And Kady doesn't seem
to share your reservation.

11:01.259 --> 11:04.794
She seems better.

11:04.846 --> 11:06.296
Yeah.

11:06.348 --> 11:09.682
I don't know why I feel this way.

11:09.718 --> 11:11.851
Our Lady came to me in a dream.

11:11.887 --> 11:14.020
Shouldn't that remove all doubt?

11:14.055 --> 11:16.890
Look, something like this
is about intention,

11:16.942 --> 11:18.975
what we bring into it.

11:19.027 --> 11:21.144
Our intentions are pure.

11:21.196 --> 11:22.645
So just stop worrying?

11:22.697 --> 11:23.730
Yeah.

11:23.782 --> 11:25.148
Just like...

11:25.200 --> 11:27.317
For now.

11:27.369 --> 11:29.319
Tomorrow you can worry all you want

11:29.321 --> 11:30.703
about Our Lady Underground.

11:30.739 --> 11:32.322
Tonight...

11:32.374 --> 11:34.157
tonight should be about Dionysus.

11:34.159 --> 11:35.541
Whoo, ooh.

11:35.577 --> 11:38.878
Dionysus, okay.

11:38.914 --> 11:40.496
You, uh...

11:40.498 --> 11:43.333
you bang a lot of undergrads
with that one?

11:43.385 --> 11:45.001
Fewer than I'd hoped.

12:11.966 --> 12:14.049
- Hmm?
- Say it works.

12:14.101 --> 12:16.185
And that means what for you?

12:16.305 --> 12:18.303
You asking if I'm coming back?

12:18.355 --> 12:21.189
Kind of, yeah.

12:22.208 --> 12:24.443
I hadn't much planned for it really.

12:24.478 --> 12:26.478
I just want to get there,

12:26.530 --> 12:30.949
and I'll stay or go somewhere quiet.

12:30.985 --> 12:34.236
If Our Lady has other plans, hmm,

12:34.288 --> 12:36.238
I'll do that.

12:36.240 --> 12:38.457
I'll miss you.

12:38.492 --> 12:40.742
I'll miss you too.

12:44.882 --> 12:46.665
To think you were so crabby in rehab,

12:46.717 --> 12:48.300
we almost never spoke.

12:49.586 --> 12:50.969
Hey.

12:51.005 --> 12:54.256
God, you are really something, Julia.

12:54.308 --> 12:55.974
I bet you say that to all the girls

12:56.010 --> 12:58.093
you slept with three minutes ago.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.928
- That's funny.
- Hmm.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.681
But I mean it.
I do.

13:02.733 --> 13:04.516
That bite, that--

13:04.568 --> 13:06.651
that thing in you that wants
to puzzle everything out,

13:06.687 --> 13:09.438
that is gold.

13:11.575 --> 13:14.026
No matter how crabby it makes me?

13:14.078 --> 13:16.828
I think especially
when it makes you crabby.

13:16.864 --> 13:19.614
I think that us angry,

13:19.666 --> 13:22.534
questioning people
sometimes shut up too fast,

13:22.586 --> 13:27.506
and that is probably part
of why the gods took off.

13:27.541 --> 13:30.175
No one around with the fire

13:30.210 --> 13:33.345
to keep yelling their names.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.630
This is gonna sound corny,

13:35.632 --> 13:38.350
but don't lose that fire.

13:38.385 --> 13:41.136
Well, it sounds like
you're saying good-bye.

13:41.138 --> 13:43.305
I'm saying thank you.

13:48.062 --> 13:50.145
So this is a little hitch
in our adventure.

13:50.197 --> 13:52.230
Are we just gonna act
like children now?

13:52.282 --> 13:54.483
Now, now, Bambi.
He's got a right to be mad.

13:54.535 --> 13:55.817
No, he doesn't.

13:55.819 --> 13:57.152
People don't get to be mad at me

13:57.154 --> 13:58.653
because I had sex with them.

13:58.705 --> 14:00.989
You're welcome, both of you.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.324
Oh, come on.

14:02.326 --> 14:04.543
We were all messed up
on emotion magic.

14:04.578 --> 14:06.044
We deserve a pass.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.329
I don't need a pass.

14:07.331 --> 14:08.747
You two have ruined my life.

14:08.799 --> 14:10.048
No offense, Quentin,

14:10.084 --> 14:11.666
but I think you did that
all yourself.

14:11.718 --> 14:13.835
Can we just cut to the part
where we go to another world

14:13.837 --> 14:18.006
and skip the whole guilt
and recriminations bit, please?

14:18.058 --> 14:20.892
You would like that, wouldn't you?

14:20.928 --> 14:24.062
Is it wrong that I'm starting
to side with The Beast?

14:35.609 --> 14:37.409
Mmm.

14:40.697 --> 14:42.531
Ah! Ah.

14:42.583 --> 14:44.416
Fuck.

15:01.602 --> 15:03.602
All right.

15:19.453 --> 15:21.987
Didn't think you had that in you.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.626
You don't get to shame me.

15:27.661 --> 15:29.911
You slept with two other people.
We broke up.

15:29.913 --> 15:32.164
I was out of my mind.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.833
I made a mistake,

15:34.885 --> 15:36.251
and you aimed a weapon.

15:36.303 --> 15:38.253
I'm glad it hurt.
It should hurt.

15:38.255 --> 15:39.971
Boys and girls,

15:40.007 --> 15:42.807
I hate to cut into
what is clearly a moment,

15:42.843 --> 15:44.342
but the fact is,

15:44.394 --> 15:46.761
according to the best
and only magic we have,

15:46.763 --> 15:48.980
we have to go
or The Beast will kill us.

15:49.016 --> 15:50.265
End of story.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.150
Take out your emotions.

15:52.186 --> 15:53.768
You can fight later.

15:53.770 --> 15:55.820
Sound good?

15:58.275 --> 16:01.109
All right, if you guys
are using those emotion bottles,

16:01.161 --> 16:02.827
let's go.

16:29.890 --> 16:33.441
How I was feeling about Quentin
would have got us all killed.

16:36.647 --> 16:38.530
I was very angry a moment ago,

16:38.565 --> 16:40.315
but I have to be honest.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.200
You two would make a cute couple.

16:44.571 --> 16:47.789
Join hands, everyone.

17:01.555 --> 17:04.388
Let's move, fast.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.174
The map says--

17:06.226 --> 17:09.227
Got it.

17:10.814 --> 17:12.012
Quentin?

17:12.065 --> 17:13.431
We've been waiting.

17:17.654 --> 17:19.521
Run!

17:26.029 --> 17:28.496
Shit.

17:35.010 --> 17:36.341
***

17:36.581 --> 17:37.701
How'd you find this place?

17:37.748 --> 17:38.781
Got lucky last time.

17:38.833 --> 17:40.866
Quentin had the map.

17:40.918 --> 17:42.368
- Shit.
- No map,

17:42.420 --> 17:44.036
evil mercenary assholes everywhere,

17:44.038 --> 17:45.371
stuck in a library--

17:45.373 --> 17:47.540
this is not how we decided
this would go.

17:47.592 --> 17:50.376
Penny, you know this place.

17:50.378 --> 17:53.379
There must be somebody
we can talk to.

17:53.431 --> 17:55.130
Yeah, there might be.

17:55.183 --> 17:57.099
Follow me.

18:04.859 --> 18:07.393
Penny, Alice, Eliot, and Janet,

18:07.395 --> 18:08.827
you are all late.

18:08.863 --> 18:10.496
Actually, it's Margo.

18:10.531 --> 18:11.597
This time.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.132
Look, we need your help,

18:13.167 --> 18:15.568
though you probably
already knew that.

18:15.603 --> 18:16.802
I did.

18:16.837 --> 18:18.904
The answer is yes, you can stay,

18:18.906 --> 18:20.406
with a few caveats.

18:20.458 --> 18:21.740
Here it comes.

18:21.742 --> 18:24.793
One, no harm comes to the books.

18:24.829 --> 18:26.295
Yeah, we get that.

18:26.330 --> 18:28.247
Two, no food, drinks,
or any other intoxicants

18:28.249 --> 18:31.467
are allowed in the library
at any time.

18:43.681 --> 18:45.514
That includes emotion bottles.

18:45.566 --> 18:47.933
Damage always ensues.

18:52.323 --> 18:54.323
You understand, of course.

18:56.694 --> 18:59.778
I planned my whole outfit
around that bottle!

19:08.005 --> 19:10.122
Could you get to the point, Quentin?

19:10.124 --> 19:11.790
I have a trustees meeting.

19:11.792 --> 19:13.959
You know something about
what's been happening here--

19:14.011 --> 19:16.545
The Beast, Eliza.

19:16.597 --> 19:19.348
I would like to know
what is really going on here.

19:19.383 --> 19:20.966
I know you would,

19:21.018 --> 19:22.801
but we are done.

19:22.803 --> 19:24.970
How did you lose your virginity?

19:25.022 --> 19:27.139
I was 24 years old.

19:27.141 --> 19:28.724
I was too embarrassed to tell anyone.

19:28.776 --> 19:30.643
She was considerably older than I

19:30.695 --> 19:34.146
and, oh, much, much more experienced.

19:34.148 --> 19:36.815
But...

19:36.817 --> 19:39.068
Fuck!

19:39.120 --> 19:41.570
You've managed to dose me,
haven't you?

19:41.622 --> 19:44.823
In my tea.
You little shit.

19:44.875 --> 19:48.827
Truth serum is toxic,
Quentin, and banned.

19:48.879 --> 19:50.496
And if you were going
to throw magic at me,

19:50.548 --> 19:52.881
you would have done so already,
but you haven't.

19:52.917 --> 19:55.334
Eliza...

19:55.336 --> 19:56.719
who is she?

19:56.754 --> 20:00.756
Eliza's real name is Jane Chatwin.

20:00.808 --> 20:03.559
Oh...

20:03.594 --> 20:05.594
I was kind of poking around
in the dark with that one.

20:05.646 --> 20:09.181
Uh...

20:09.233 --> 20:11.567
Okay, what does Jane
have to do with The Beast?

20:11.602 --> 20:14.520
Do you remember the gift
that Jane was given in the book

20:14.572 --> 20:17.022
"The Girl Who Told Time"?

20:17.074 --> 20:21.193
Uh, yeah, Ember gave her
a watch and a locket.

20:21.195 --> 20:24.113
Ember gave her the ability
to fuck with time

20:24.165 --> 20:25.698
on a cosmic scale,

20:25.750 --> 20:28.450
and Jane used it
to create a time loop.

20:28.502 --> 20:30.953
When she'd fail to stop The Beast,

20:31.005 --> 20:32.538
she'd restart the loop.

20:32.540 --> 20:34.039
A time loop.

20:34.091 --> 20:36.375
Okay.

20:36.377 --> 20:38.377
Uh...

20:38.379 --> 20:41.630
So what do we have to do
with The Beast?

20:41.682 --> 20:43.215
You just keep getting involved.

20:43.217 --> 20:45.050
I don't keep doing anything.

20:45.102 --> 20:46.602
Can you imagine, Quentin,

20:46.637 --> 20:51.440
how many times we've had
this exact conversation?

20:51.475 --> 20:55.060
You've managed to slip
truth serum to me 27 times,

20:55.062 --> 20:57.896
27 ways, and I'm quite sick of it.

20:57.898 --> 20:59.064
So, what, this is just some

20:59.116 --> 21:00.733
giant, blood-soaked
"Groundhog Day"?

21:00.735 --> 21:03.235
You always bring up
that fucking movie.

21:03.237 --> 21:04.953
I still haven't seen it.

21:06.073 --> 21:07.823
Now it's a point of pride.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.241
Answer my question.

21:09.243 --> 21:10.826
In each loop,

21:10.878 --> 21:14.246
Jane alters something

21:14.248 --> 21:17.132
to see if it'll change the outcome.

21:17.168 --> 21:18.967
The sigil that appeared on your hand,

21:19.003 --> 21:20.636
brought you to Alice--

21:20.671 --> 21:22.755
that was Jane trying
to get the ball rolling,

21:22.757 --> 21:25.424
trying to get you all
together, working fast,

21:25.426 --> 21:27.676
and we all know how well
that particular great idea

21:27.728 --> 21:30.429
worked out, don't we?

21:30.481 --> 21:32.264
So has anything actually helped?

21:32.266 --> 21:35.350
So far, all the loops
end in your death.

21:35.403 --> 21:36.935
How many times have I died?

21:36.987 --> 21:38.437
39.

21:38.439 --> 21:40.439
39 times.

21:40.441 --> 21:42.274
And if you die a 40th,

21:42.326 --> 21:43.692
at least I won't have to hear you

21:43.744 --> 21:46.361
ask me this question ever again.

21:46.414 --> 21:49.281
Jane's dead, Quentin.

21:49.283 --> 21:50.783
The loop's done.

21:50.785 --> 21:54.002
There's no one to reset it.

21:54.038 --> 21:55.838
So this is it?

21:55.873 --> 21:57.506
This isn't my problem.

21:57.541 --> 21:59.508
My problem is that I'm strong enough

21:59.543 --> 22:01.627
to discern a time loop

22:01.629 --> 22:03.378
but not strong enough to change it.

22:03.431 --> 22:05.047
We better hope and pray

22:05.099 --> 22:07.966
that Jane altered the right
thing this time around.

22:07.968 --> 22:10.135
Anything else, Quentin?

22:10.187 --> 22:12.054
What's different this time?

22:16.560 --> 22:18.610
Please, no books on the floor.

22:24.485 --> 22:26.535
I love this one.

22:26.570 --> 22:30.405
Photos from places I can't imagine.

22:30.458 --> 22:33.242
I know you hate it now,

22:33.294 --> 22:36.245
but travelers wrote
our most precious books.

22:36.297 --> 22:39.164
The library is what it is
because of them.

22:39.216 --> 22:42.167
You make it sound so simple and fun.

22:42.169 --> 22:43.919
No.

22:43.971 --> 22:45.671
But it is valuable.

22:45.673 --> 22:47.222
And in my observation,

22:47.258 --> 22:51.009
master travelers have
a fantastic time doing it.

22:53.264 --> 22:55.848
I was looking for any technical info

22:55.900 --> 22:58.734
that would get me anywhere
close to mastery, but--

22:58.769 --> 23:01.403
The books you seek
are in another branch.

23:01.438 --> 23:04.356
Of course they are.

23:04.408 --> 23:07.526
Look, could you--
could you expedite that shit?

23:07.578 --> 23:09.278
I don't have much time,

23:09.330 --> 23:12.364
and I really need to know
how to take people with me.

23:12.416 --> 23:14.867
I'll put in a request.

23:14.919 --> 23:16.952
Why am I not feeling optimistic?

23:17.004 --> 23:18.954
Probably because
Franz Kafka wrote "The Trial"

23:19.006 --> 23:22.424
after spending a week in the library.

23:22.459 --> 23:26.879
But, Penny, if you can
survive long enough,

23:26.881 --> 23:30.132
you will get a handle on it.

23:30.184 --> 23:33.051
I promise.

23:33.103 --> 23:35.137
If?

23:35.189 --> 23:37.890
Say that in my book?

23:39.860 --> 23:41.944
No spoilers.

24:06.086 --> 24:08.053
Hi.

24:13.047 --> 24:14.422
I was at Brakebills.

24:14.662 --> 24:15.702
You were supposed to be.

24:15.747 --> 24:19.031
Or you were, like, 39 times.

24:19.083 --> 24:20.867
You were the thing they changed.

24:20.869 --> 24:23.035
Jane thought, you know,
cast you out in the cold,

24:23.037 --> 24:25.037
and you would get stronger,
and--

24:25.089 --> 24:27.373
So I was right.

24:27.425 --> 24:29.542
The whole time, I was right.

24:30.124 --> 24:32.744
I don't know what to say, Jules. I...

24:34.048 --> 24:35.408
I should have believed you, Jules.

24:35.433 --> 24:39.051
I should have known,
and I'm--I'm...

24:39.103 --> 24:41.220
Um...

24:41.272 --> 24:45.057
Look, that doesn't make up
for what I did to you,

24:45.109 --> 24:49.111
which was stupid

24:49.147 --> 24:52.398
and vindictive

24:52.450 --> 24:56.319
and really dangerous.

24:56.371 --> 24:59.906
I'm so sorry, Q.

24:59.958 --> 25:01.457
Thank you.

25:04.796 --> 25:06.162
So how do we fix it?

25:06.214 --> 25:09.332
I don't know.

25:09.384 --> 25:11.083
I just know that
I'm gonna get killed soon,

25:11.085 --> 25:13.085
and I don't really want to die

25:13.087 --> 25:17.306
being mad at my oldest friend.

25:17.342 --> 25:19.091
I really fucking missed you.

25:19.143 --> 25:21.060
Yeah, me, too, actually.

25:29.270 --> 25:31.988
You smell the same.

25:36.077 --> 25:38.027
Okay, all right.

25:38.079 --> 25:39.445
Uh...

25:39.447 --> 25:42.031
So...

25:42.083 --> 25:43.866
Big conspiracy.

25:43.918 --> 25:45.284
Wheels within wheels.

25:45.286 --> 25:47.787
Julia doesn't go to Brakebills, and?

25:47.789 --> 25:52.008
You're taking this a lot
better than I would have.

25:52.043 --> 25:56.295
It's because there is bigger,
better magic in the world.

25:56.297 --> 25:58.965
I mean, you would not believe
some of the shit I've seen.

25:58.967 --> 26:01.634
I can barely believe it.

26:01.636 --> 26:05.471
Wha--what?

26:05.523 --> 26:08.391
Some friends and I got into
some pretty eclectic shit.

26:08.443 --> 26:10.192
You and Kady?

26:10.228 --> 26:12.228
Where is she?

26:12.280 --> 26:14.146
On a mission.

26:14.198 --> 26:16.983
They all are.

26:16.985 --> 26:19.151
They got pretty strict
marching orders.

26:19.203 --> 26:20.820
From?

26:20.872 --> 26:23.739
A goddess.

26:23.791 --> 26:27.543
We summoned, and she came.

26:27.578 --> 26:29.412
You mean, um, here?

26:29.464 --> 26:32.214
To your loft?

26:32.250 --> 26:34.717
You don't believe me.
Shit, I wouldn't either.

26:34.752 --> 26:38.004
That is why she gave me proof.

26:44.312 --> 26:45.511
Is that milk?

26:45.563 --> 26:46.512
Yeah.

26:46.564 --> 26:47.847
Cool,

26:47.849 --> 26:48.898
useless,

26:48.933 --> 26:50.232
kind of gross.

26:50.268 --> 26:53.853
But look under the hood.

26:58.443 --> 27:00.693
Oh, my God.

27:00.745 --> 27:02.411
Who did this magic?

27:02.447 --> 27:05.531
I told you.
She did.

27:05.533 --> 27:07.366
I mean, it was crazy.

27:07.418 --> 27:11.253
It was like being
on a massive dose of ecstasy.

27:11.289 --> 27:12.872
When she touched me,

27:12.924 --> 27:15.124
it was like my psyche was defragging.

27:15.176 --> 27:17.293
I mean, she--
she touched all of us.

27:17.345 --> 27:19.545
She granted every petition.

27:19.547 --> 27:21.797
She cured Menolly's breast cancer;

27:21.849 --> 27:25.301
she sent Richard
to where he wanted to go.

27:25.353 --> 27:26.886
I watched this.

27:26.888 --> 27:28.721
I thought magic couldn't cure cancer.

27:28.773 --> 27:30.556
Not regular magic.

27:30.558 --> 27:32.975
Look, I can't lie, okay?

27:33.027 --> 27:36.228
It was shitty going
for a while there,

27:36.230 --> 27:37.613
not being in Brakebills,

27:37.648 --> 27:40.066
but I can't sit here now

27:40.118 --> 27:43.119
and think it was anything but fate.

27:43.154 --> 27:46.739
Right, or just the right
random combination.

27:46.791 --> 27:49.158
Okay, suit yourself, nihilist.

27:53.664 --> 27:55.081
I need your help.

27:55.083 --> 27:56.916
I don't know how to get back,

27:56.918 --> 28:00.419
and, um, my friends,
we got separated,

28:00.421 --> 28:02.588
and I just--I can't let them
fight The Beast on their own,

28:02.640 --> 28:04.757
and I have to find
a way, um--

28:04.809 --> 28:06.092
Let me get this straight.

28:06.144 --> 28:10.596
You want me to come
to Fillory with you.

28:10.598 --> 28:12.598
Uh, yeah.

28:14.819 --> 28:18.154
Come here.

28:18.189 --> 28:20.990
Holy shit.
This is our table.

28:21.025 --> 28:23.442
Kind of been planning
this trip since we were nine.

28:23.494 --> 28:25.161
We kind of have, huh?

28:25.196 --> 28:27.947
Our Lady gave me
a mission to--

28:27.949 --> 28:30.116
I sound like a nutjob.

28:30.168 --> 28:32.168
Kind of.

28:32.203 --> 28:35.287
What's the mission?

28:35.289 --> 28:38.290
She said it was my destiny

28:38.342 --> 28:41.710
to basically find
a whole new kind of magic.

28:41.762 --> 28:43.879
You know, she said it was something

28:43.931 --> 28:46.048
that couldn't be given.

28:46.100 --> 28:48.384
It had to be found.

28:48.436 --> 28:52.555
So we have to find it.

28:52.607 --> 28:54.356
And I bet you it's here.

28:54.392 --> 28:57.393
So I guess we're off
to see the Wizard.

28:57.445 --> 29:00.062
Have you given any thought
to how we're gonna get there?

29:00.114 --> 29:02.531
Start of the London Blitz, 1940,

29:02.567 --> 29:04.817
and then their mom dies, 1941.

29:04.819 --> 29:06.485
Q, where are you going with this?

29:06.487 --> 29:09.371
Okay, so we can't just
open a door to Fillory,

29:09.407 --> 29:12.041
but we do know
when they open--

29:12.076 --> 29:13.375
every time the Chatwins go.

29:13.411 --> 29:14.994
So if we could just
find a way to get there,

29:15.046 --> 29:17.163
then we could follow 'em in.

29:17.215 --> 29:18.714
Uh...

29:18.749 --> 29:22.668
Look, all I know is time magic
is apparently a thing,

29:22.720 --> 29:24.837
a thing that's been dicking with
us for the past 39 lifetimes.

29:24.889 --> 29:27.673
So I say we find a way
to make it work for us.

29:27.675 --> 29:30.559
Wait, but that would put us
in past Fillory, right?

29:30.595 --> 29:32.728
Fillory is magic.

29:32.763 --> 29:35.397
Remember, Jane falls in that swamp,

29:35.433 --> 29:37.183
and then she comes out
20 years later.

29:37.185 --> 29:39.351
She strikes a deal
with the Watcherwoman

29:39.353 --> 29:41.270
to send her back.

29:41.322 --> 29:45.741
Once you're there,
there's always a way.

29:45.776 --> 29:47.409
I have an idea,

29:47.445 --> 29:49.028
something Richard told me,

29:49.030 --> 29:51.697
but we have to go
somewhere to get it.

29:51.699 --> 29:53.449
Brakebills.

29:53.501 --> 29:54.783
Okay.

29:54.835 --> 29:56.535
Uh, you just have to be
a registered student

29:56.537 --> 29:58.871
in order to get through the wards.

29:58.923 --> 30:01.040
Alumni key.

30:01.092 --> 30:03.592
Richard gave it to me.

30:04.795 --> 30:06.095
This place is impossible.

30:06.130 --> 30:07.880
How does anyone find anything?

30:07.882 --> 30:10.466
There's a whole wing
on cat paintings.

30:10.518 --> 30:13.135
What have you got?
Anything?

30:13.187 --> 30:15.054
"The Book of
Mike McCormick."

30:15.106 --> 30:17.056
Novella, really.

30:19.193 --> 30:22.228
He was actually a Republican.
Can you believe it?

30:22.230 --> 30:24.063
But the worst part?

30:24.065 --> 30:26.115
His life was happy.

30:26.150 --> 30:27.566
Eliot, he's gone.

30:27.568 --> 30:29.318
Why are you torturing yourself?

30:29.370 --> 30:32.738
Because he's gone and it's my fault.

30:32.790 --> 30:34.456
And of all the people in the world

30:34.492 --> 30:37.409
who don't understand,
somehow you top the list.

30:39.714 --> 30:41.914
- What are you doing?
- Putting the past behind me.

30:41.966 --> 30:44.250
No, stop!

30:44.252 --> 30:45.584
Look, he's had a really bad week.

30:45.586 --> 30:47.169
We'll pay the fine, whatever.

30:47.221 --> 30:50.172
Nope, no, you are banished
from the library forever.

30:50.224 --> 30:52.258
It's one book.

30:52.260 --> 30:54.310
No, it's a life.

30:54.345 --> 30:56.095
They're irreplaceable.

30:57.181 --> 30:58.230
No, wait!

31:01.569 --> 31:02.935
What did you do?

31:02.937 --> 31:05.938
Let's go.

31:09.327 --> 31:11.610
<i>"Bridge to ancient Rome."</i>

31:11.612 --> 31:15.531
"Bridge to
the Cretaceous period."

31:15.583 --> 31:17.116
Oh, hey, here's one.

31:17.168 --> 31:19.618
"Southampton, England, 1912"?

31:19.670 --> 31:22.121
Voyage of the "Titanic."

31:22.173 --> 31:23.839
Oh, fun.

31:23.874 --> 31:25.474
So we're pretty sure
these things only go

31:25.509 --> 31:27.626
to one specific
point in time and--

31:27.628 --> 31:29.461
Once you log a date in,
you're locked.

31:29.463 --> 31:32.631
I mean, they use some tiny piece
of an incredibly rare element.

31:32.633 --> 31:34.883
All got used up by the '70s.

31:34.935 --> 31:36.385
Wait a minute.

31:36.437 --> 31:38.470
Wait.
Here's a thesis.

31:38.472 --> 31:42.141
A bunch of students wanted
to go back and kill Hitler.

31:42.193 --> 31:45.311
"Operation Die Fuehrer."

31:45.363 --> 31:46.478
Guess no one told 'em Hitler was

31:46.480 --> 31:47.980
a pretty serious battle Magician?

31:48.032 --> 31:49.481
Yeah.

31:49.533 --> 31:51.567
Uh, yep, and Hitler killed them.

31:51.619 --> 31:53.068
Wait, what's the date
on the time bridge?

31:53.120 --> 31:56.822
Uh, it's April 19, 1942.

31:56.824 --> 31:59.491
April 19th.

31:59.543 --> 32:01.327
Yeah.

32:01.379 --> 32:05.247
You remember the, uh--
yeah, "The Flying Forest."

32:05.299 --> 32:07.583
Yeah, uh, Jane's going into town.

32:07.635 --> 32:10.419
She's looking for
a present for Martin.

32:10.471 --> 32:14.173
April 21, 1942.

32:14.225 --> 32:16.175
Two days after this time bridge.

32:16.227 --> 32:18.060
Holy shit, Q, this could work.

32:18.095 --> 32:20.346
I never thought I'd say it,
but thank God for Hitler.

32:20.348 --> 32:24.400
Yeah, no, that still sounds bad.

32:24.435 --> 32:25.901
Yeah.

32:27.988 --> 32:30.439
Earth fountain's blocked off.

32:30.491 --> 32:31.690
I told you it would be.

32:31.742 --> 32:32.908
It was worth a shot.

32:32.943 --> 32:34.610
I mean, what else are we gonna do?

32:34.662 --> 32:36.195
I don't know.
How about not get us kicked out

32:36.247 --> 32:37.746
of the library in the first place?

32:37.782 --> 32:39.915
All right, let's keep moving.

32:40.355 --> 32:42.939
Hey.
Don't walk one more step.

32:42.941 --> 32:44.691
We're highly trained Earth magicians.

32:44.743 --> 32:47.160
Hold up. Hold up.
You guys are from Brakebills?

32:47.196 --> 32:50.113
Dude, Josh Hoberman, class of '16.

32:50.165 --> 32:52.282
Come with me if you want to live.

32:52.334 --> 32:54.284
I've always wanted to say that.

32:57.756 --> 32:59.840
But seriously, um, we should go.

33:04.151 --> 33:06.272
Welcome to ***.

33:09.099 --> 33:11.015
You're welcome to whatever.

33:11.067 --> 33:12.600
Just don't eat the carrots.

33:12.652 --> 33:15.770
They're totally psychedelic
for some reason.

33:15.822 --> 33:18.940
Circumstances in the
Neitherlands are super weird.

33:18.992 --> 33:20.675
Holy shit.

33:20.710 --> 33:22.360
This tastes like pizza.

33:22.412 --> 33:23.862
Yeah, I know, right?

33:23.914 --> 33:25.280
How long have you been down here?

33:25.332 --> 33:26.781
A few weeks.

33:26.833 --> 33:28.199
Just been camped out,

33:28.251 --> 33:29.667
waiting to see if anyone else
will show up.

33:29.703 --> 33:30.785
Anyone else?

33:30.837 --> 33:32.287
From my class.

33:32.339 --> 33:34.122
Look, don't freak,
but back at Brakebills,

33:34.124 --> 33:35.673
nobody knows what happened
to you guys.

33:35.709 --> 33:38.293
And it's sort of been two years.

33:38.345 --> 33:40.795
Oh, shit.
Right, the whole time thing.

33:40.797 --> 33:42.297
Victoria warned me about that.

33:42.299 --> 33:46.050
Victoria?
You know her?

33:46.102 --> 33:48.019
She's the only reason I'm alive.

33:48.054 --> 33:49.771
Look are you gonna tell us

33:49.806 --> 33:51.556
what the fuck happened
to your class, or what?

33:51.608 --> 33:52.640
Where'd you guys go?

33:52.692 --> 33:53.892
To Fillory

33:53.944 --> 33:56.694
for spring break.

33:56.730 --> 33:58.396
V's amazing.

33:58.448 --> 34:01.482
I mean, she literally blips
around the universe, fearless.

34:01.534 --> 34:03.985
<i>Teachers put this tattoo
on her to stop her.</i>

34:04.037 --> 34:05.870
She just cut it off herself.

34:05.906 --> 34:07.238
- Joshy.
- What?

34:07.290 --> 34:08.539
- You're not gonna believe it.
- What?

34:08.574 --> 34:10.909
I did it.
I found Fillory.

34:10.960 --> 34:12.493
- What?
- I found Fillory!

34:12.495 --> 34:14.045
- Oh, my God!
- Whoo! We're going to Fillory!

34:14.080 --> 34:15.580
- We're going to Fillory?
- Uh-huh!

34:15.632 --> 34:17.331
<i>So we decided to plan a trip.</i>

34:17.333 --> 34:19.167
<i>You know, party,
smoke out with the centaurs,</i>

34:19.168 --> 34:21.052
<i>be back in time for classes,</i>

34:21.087 --> 34:23.554
<i>but word got out to practically
the whole first year class,</i>

34:23.590 --> 34:25.340
<i>except for a couple losers.</i>

34:25.391 --> 34:26.841
<i>Luckily, V was so good,</i>

34:26.842 --> 34:28.760
<i>she was able to take them all with.</i>

34:28.812 --> 34:30.895
<i>It was magical.</i>

34:30.931 --> 34:33.181
<i>I mean, more magical</i>

34:33.233 --> 34:34.766
<i>than Brakebills,</i>

34:34.818 --> 34:38.018
<i>like going from black and white
to color.</i>

34:38.071 --> 34:40.438
V and I had a threesome with a naiad.

34:40.489 --> 34:44.108
This guy Donnie, he had sex
with a talking horse.

34:44.159 --> 34:46.360
I mean, it's not exactly
taboo in Fillory

34:46.413 --> 34:48.029
since the animals can give consent,

34:48.031 --> 34:49.746
but we were all still
a bit squicked out.

34:49.783 --> 34:52.033
We get it.
You fucked some animals.

34:52.034 --> 34:55.370
How'd you end up here?

34:55.371 --> 34:57.588
Got roped into this quest.

34:57.624 --> 35:01.209
Ended up being a trap for Victoria.

35:01.261 --> 35:04.379
This dude--Mothra,
I've been calling him--

35:04.381 --> 35:05.713
Yeah, we know that clown.

35:05.765 --> 35:07.799
It was a bloodbath.

35:07.851 --> 35:09.934
V zapped me here,
and then she went back in.

35:09.970 --> 35:11.219
Told me to stay put,

35:11.271 --> 35:14.555
so I have just been waiting.

35:14.607 --> 35:17.775
V should have been here by now.

35:19.646 --> 35:22.113
He caught her.

35:22.148 --> 35:23.314
But she's still alive.

35:23.366 --> 35:24.899
How do you know that?

35:24.951 --> 35:28.286
I'm like her.
It's why I'm here.

35:28.321 --> 35:30.738
We can all go, rescue Victoria.

35:30.740 --> 35:31.956
You can take us.

35:31.992 --> 35:34.993
I...

35:35.045 --> 35:37.912
haven't exactly cracked

35:37.914 --> 35:40.748
the whole ride-along yet.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.166
Okay, forget traveling.

35:42.218 --> 35:43.918
Uh, we'll just take a fountain.

35:43.970 --> 35:47.138
Except we don't know
where the Fillory fountain is.

35:47.173 --> 35:48.589
That's easy.

35:48.591 --> 35:50.141
It's three squares up,
one square left.

35:50.176 --> 35:52.593
The problem is all the
battle magic dick buckets

35:52.645 --> 35:54.429
waiting to vaporize us.

35:54.481 --> 35:56.514
Discuss.

36:02.989 --> 36:04.655
It's in the closet.

36:04.691 --> 36:09.160
El and Margo made a door
to their favorite pub in London.

36:09.195 --> 36:11.496
They look like fun.

36:11.531 --> 36:12.997
Look, you were supposed to be here.

36:13.033 --> 36:14.499
You were supposed
to be a part of this.

36:14.534 --> 36:16.367
No, you know, I think Jane was right.

36:16.419 --> 36:17.835
Had I been here living it up,

36:17.871 --> 36:19.454
I would have never
felt the need to figure out

36:19.456 --> 36:21.005
what magic is actually for.

36:21.041 --> 36:23.374
Okay, so what's magic
actually for, then?

36:25.211 --> 36:27.545
For fixing things, dummy.

36:29.215 --> 36:30.298
Trust me.

36:30.300 --> 36:31.883
I, uh, made a lot of mistakes

36:31.935 --> 36:34.135
before I figured that one out.

36:34.187 --> 36:37.472
Yeah, everything I've been
able to fix doesn't matter,

36:37.524 --> 36:40.641
just minor mendings and bullshit.

36:40.693 --> 36:43.194
Yeah, well, if fixing
big things were easy,

36:43.229 --> 36:45.363
everyone would do it.

36:45.398 --> 36:47.448
Come on.

36:49.819 --> 36:52.653
Alice.

36:52.655 --> 36:55.490
Get some sleep.

36:55.492 --> 36:57.158
I know.

36:57.160 --> 36:58.659
I might as well.

36:58.661 --> 37:01.329
I'll never figure this out.

37:01.331 --> 37:04.332
Trying to think of how to get us
all to the Fillory fountain

37:04.334 --> 37:05.800
without getting us killed.

37:09.556 --> 37:12.557
Need a hand?

37:12.592 --> 37:16.060
Look, Penny,

37:16.096 --> 37:19.013
I'm sorry if I gave you
the wrong idea, but--

37:19.015 --> 37:21.349
Whoa, stop.

37:21.401 --> 37:25.186
It was fun, okay?

37:25.238 --> 37:28.573
You're one of the few people
I actually respect.

37:28.608 --> 37:31.359
Uh, yeah, you're right, right.

37:31.361 --> 37:33.361
I'm just making this weird, huh?

37:33.413 --> 37:35.363
Eh, it's weird.

37:35.415 --> 37:38.666
We're weird.
So what?

37:40.420 --> 37:42.870
We're friends, right?

37:47.010 --> 37:49.210
I just keep thinking about Quentin.

37:49.262 --> 37:50.928
Look, I know.

37:50.964 --> 37:52.763
I just keep thinking
how awful it would be

37:52.799 --> 37:54.465
if, out of all of us, he was the one

37:54.517 --> 37:56.767
who didn't get to see Fillory.

37:56.803 --> 37:59.804
And then I remember that I hate him.

37:59.856 --> 38:01.722
Fuck, why am I such an idiot?

38:01.724 --> 38:03.107
Okay.

38:03.143 --> 38:06.894
Quentin is irrelevant.

38:06.946 --> 38:09.897
Just another excuse
for that thing you always do.

38:09.949 --> 38:10.949
What thing?

38:10.984 --> 38:12.116
"I should just give up.

38:12.152 --> 38:13.734
I'll never figure it out."

38:13.786 --> 38:15.570
Shit got real.

38:15.622 --> 38:17.488
If you're gonna drop that bullshit,

38:17.540 --> 38:20.074
now's the time.

38:20.126 --> 38:21.742
<i>Phosphoromancy.</i>

38:21.794 --> 38:24.162
I can bend light around us,
all of us,

38:24.214 --> 38:25.663
the whole group, I think,

38:25.715 --> 38:27.465
make us invisible.

38:27.500 --> 38:28.916
It'll be difficult with the two suns

38:28.918 --> 38:30.468
but not impossible.

38:30.503 --> 38:31.919
We'll have to move
in a pretty tight formation.

38:31.921 --> 38:33.004
When should we leave?

38:33.056 --> 38:34.255
As soon as possible.

38:34.307 --> 38:35.806
The suns are just about in position.

38:35.842 --> 38:38.009
It has begun!

38:38.061 --> 38:39.427
Sorry.

38:39.479 --> 38:41.312
Penny, Eliot, you're both tall,

38:41.347 --> 38:43.264
so you'll have to duck down
and stay close to me, okay?

38:43.316 --> 38:45.183
- Or they'll see you.
- Got it.

38:45.235 --> 38:47.185
We got it, right?

38:49.439 --> 38:51.522
Eliot, are you coming?

38:51.574 --> 38:55.276
Right behind you, Bambi.

39:03.794 --> 39:07.463
Let's do this.

39:07.515 --> 39:09.465
Okay.

39:17.608 --> 39:18.608
Holy shit.

39:21.145 --> 39:23.979
Is that an air raid siren?

39:24.031 --> 39:25.647
Okay.

39:25.699 --> 39:28.066
1942.

39:28.068 --> 39:29.485
We need to get out of here.

39:29.537 --> 39:30.537
Yeah.

39:36.961 --> 39:39.128
Go to the right.

39:48.339 --> 39:50.973
Is everything all right, Eliot?

39:51.008 --> 39:53.642
I'm amazing.

39:55.146 --> 39:57.429
Go left. Go left.

40:16.283 --> 40:19.535
Yeah, I brought a gun.

40:19.587 --> 40:22.171
Thanks, Margo.

40:22.206 --> 40:25.290
You're welcome.
Why didn't you move?

40:25.292 --> 40:27.009
Acid carrots.

40:29.180 --> 40:33.215
Margo, you saved my actual life.

40:33.267 --> 40:36.051
Hooray, you live
to drink another day.

40:36.103 --> 40:37.186
Oh, shit, guys, they see us.

40:37.221 --> 40:39.471
Shit!
Go! Go!

41:14.508 --> 41:17.175
Oh, my God.

41:17.177 --> 41:19.344
She looks so young.

41:19.346 --> 41:22.180
Yeah, she's got
no idea what's coming.

41:23.400 --> 41:24.516
Hey.

41:24.518 --> 41:25.851
That's got to be it, right?

41:25.853 --> 41:27.603
Across the street,
the door to Fillory?

41:27.655 --> 41:28.854
Yeah.

41:28.906 --> 41:30.355
Ooh, here she comes.

41:38.249 --> 41:40.198
You ready, Janey?

41:40.251 --> 41:43.869
Why, yes, Martin, I think I am.

42:07.311 --> 42:09.111
Oh, my God.

42:11.315 --> 42:13.282
Q, Q.

42:16.153 --> 42:18.070
Look.
