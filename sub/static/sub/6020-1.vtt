00:13.513 --> 00:16.607
Well, it's a magnificent stone.

00:18.218 --> 00:20.516
They put it up this morning.

00:22.355 --> 00:24.880
It's just a magnificent stone.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.349
Jerry?

00:31.698 --> 00:33.290
George...

00:34.367 --> 00:36.198
...we'll leave you alone with her.

00:36.903 --> 00:38.461
-What?
-I'm sure there are things...

00:38.638 --> 00:39.866
...you'd like to say.

00:40.774 --> 00:42.537
No, I'm good.

00:43.209 --> 00:45.109
Really. Jerry?

00:45.278 --> 00:46.711
Jerry?

01:05.432 --> 01:07.161
Thank you, no.

01:07.567 --> 01:11.333
And then right after
the All-Star break we...

01:11.504 --> 01:14.667
...we just swept the Orioles.

01:15.642 --> 01:17.303
Four games.

01:18.011 --> 01:19.945
In Baltimore.

01:22.482 --> 01:24.074
So....

01:30.190 --> 01:31.452
Boy, that was awkward.

01:31.624 --> 01:32.921
I don't mind the cemetery.

01:33.726 --> 01:35.557
In fact, now I see
why people like golf.

01:35.728 --> 01:38.526
It's just nice to be outside
in a well-landscaped area.

01:39.232 --> 01:41.097
What were you saying
to the Rosses anyway?

01:41.267 --> 01:42.962
Oh, man, I don't know.

01:43.136 --> 01:46.367
I told them, "Her death takes place
in the shadow of new life.

01:46.539 --> 01:49.372
She's not really dead
if we find a way to remember her."

01:49.542 --> 01:51.635
-What is that?
-Star Trek II.

01:51.811 --> 01:53.176
Wrath of Khan.

01:53.346 --> 01:56.474
Right. Kramer and l
saw it last night.

01:56.649 --> 01:58.480
Spock dies.
They wrap him up in a towel...

01:58.651 --> 02:02.610
...and they shoot him out the bowels of
the ship in that big sunglasses case.

02:03.156 --> 02:05.886
It was a hell of a thing
when Spock died.

02:06.726 --> 02:08.193
Yeah.

02:11.631 --> 02:14.532
Well, anyway...

02:14.701 --> 02:17.295
...the stone is up. Paid my respects.

02:18.271 --> 02:20.967
-I guess that's it, huh?
-So it's over?

02:21.141 --> 02:23.974
I have mourned for three long months,
summer months too.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.339
Anybody could grieve in January.

02:26.513 --> 02:29.209
It's time for George
to start being George again.

02:29.382 --> 02:31.213
All right. So let's do something later.

02:31.384 --> 02:32.612
-How about a movie?
-Yes!.

02:32.785 --> 02:34.878
Nothing says "George" like a movie.

02:35.054 --> 02:36.487
-Movie?
-Yeah, you in?

02:36.656 --> 02:39.284
No, no, no, I can't.
I got my martial arts class.

02:39.459 --> 02:41.893
George is going to the movies.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.019
So how's your karate class going?

02:44.197 --> 02:46.665
Karate, Jerry, karate.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.267
It's the lifetime pursuit
of balance and harmony.

02:49.435 --> 02:51.096
But with punching and kicking.

02:51.671 --> 02:52.899
Jerry.

02:53.072 --> 02:55.006
Karate is not here:

02:55.175 --> 02:56.403
It's here:

02:56.576 --> 02:58.168
And here:

02:58.344 --> 03:00.209
And here:

03:00.380 --> 03:03.042
All right. I gotta go to the airport
and pick up Elaine.

03:03.216 --> 03:04.706
What, she's been away?

03:04.984 --> 03:07.714
She's been in Mexico for six weeks.

03:08.488 --> 03:11.924
I think you're wrong. We just went
to the fireworks the other day.

03:12.091 --> 03:14.184
That was July 4th.

03:18.698 --> 03:21.360
I'm out of here. When I get back
I don't wanna see you here:

03:21.534 --> 03:25.061
Here or here:

03:27.040 --> 03:28.473
It was unbelievable.

03:28.641 --> 03:33.044
Six weeks of traveling through Mexico
all on Peterman's peso.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.204
Did you get any good ideas
for the catalogue?

03:35.381 --> 03:37.315
-Tons.
-Anything you couldn't have gotten...

03:37.483 --> 03:40.714
...tearing open a bag of Doritos
and watching Viva Zapata?

03:42.088 --> 03:44.079
You don't respect my work
at all, do you?

03:44.257 --> 03:46.384
-No, I don't.
-No.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.384
So, what's been going on
around this dump?

03:49.562 --> 03:51.052
How's your fiancée?

03:51.231 --> 03:52.721
My what?

03:54.000 --> 03:57.128
Jeannie? Your fiancée?

03:57.870 --> 04:00.100
Oh, yeah. That.

04:00.273 --> 04:01.570
Well....

04:02.408 --> 04:04.433
All right. Spill it, Jerome.

04:04.611 --> 04:06.272
There's really not that much to tell.

04:06.446 --> 04:08.505
About a month ago
we were here having lunch...

04:08.681 --> 04:10.842
...and all of a sudden we both
just blurted out:

04:11.017 --> 04:13.110
-I hate you.
-I hate you.

04:13.853 --> 04:16.048
-See you.
-See you.

04:17.123 --> 04:19.591
It was unprecedented.
I mean, it was the first...

04:19.759 --> 04:22.319
...truly mutual breakup
in relationship history.

04:22.495 --> 04:24.986
No rejection, no guilt, no remorse.

04:25.164 --> 04:26.597
You've never felt remorse.

04:26.766 --> 04:29.291
I know. I feel bad about that.

04:29.702 --> 04:31.294
I bet your parents were upset, huh?

04:32.438 --> 04:34.872
-You haven't told them yet, have you?
-No.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.942
So I pressed through the rushes.

04:40.113 --> 04:44.675
There below me, the shimmering
waters of Lake Victoria.

04:44.851 --> 04:47.445
Oh, for the love of God, man.

04:47.620 --> 04:50.316
Just tell me what the product is.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.856
It's a washcloth.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.961
No washcloths.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.188
Well, Mr. Peterman...

04:58.364 --> 05:00.958
...I've got a really good idea
for a hat.

05:01.134 --> 05:06.128
Oh, my neck is one
gargantuan monkey fist.

05:06.339 --> 05:08.671
It combines
the spirit of old Mexico...

05:08.841 --> 05:11.401
...with a little big-city...

05:11.577 --> 05:12.805
...panache.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.846
I like to call it the "urban sombrero."

05:16.015 --> 05:18.245
No, no. No pears.

05:20.953 --> 05:23.786
-Mr. Peterman?
-No apples.

05:26.759 --> 05:29.284
Where's my pineapple?

05:30.063 --> 05:31.621
Are you okay, Mr. Peterman?

05:31.798 --> 05:36.098
Yes, yes, go on. Go on. Go on.

05:36.269 --> 05:41.673
Well, see, it's businessmen
taking siestas.

05:41.841 --> 05:45.242
You know, it's the urban sombrero.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.637
Mr. Peterman?

05:49.215 --> 05:52.275
I'm feeling something,
something I haven't felt for a long time.

05:52.452 --> 05:54.647
-Pride?
-No.

05:54.887 --> 05:57.720
Autonomy, complete
and total autonomy.

05:57.890 --> 05:59.551
Well, you're your own boss now.

05:59.726 --> 06:01.694
-I wanna go to a tractor pull.
-Go ahead.

06:01.861 --> 06:04.523
-I am staying out all night.
-Who's stopping you?

06:04.697 --> 06:08.656
I wanna bite into a big hunk of cheese,
just bite into it like it's an apple.

06:08.835 --> 06:10.268
Whatever.

06:10.436 --> 06:12.370
-Oh, God.
-What?

06:12.538 --> 06:14.438
-It's Dolores.
-Who?

06:14.607 --> 06:16.632
Mulva.

06:16.809 --> 06:19.437
-Jerry, hi.
-Hi, Dolores.

06:19.612 --> 06:21.102
George, you remember Dolores.

06:21.280 --> 06:22.907
-Dolores.
-Hi.

06:23.082 --> 06:24.549
I heard you got engaged.

06:24.717 --> 06:25.945
Yes, Dolores, I did.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.144
It didn't work out, though, Dolores.

06:28.321 --> 06:29.652
Oh, that's too bad.

06:29.822 --> 06:33.258
You know, we should
get together some time.

06:33.426 --> 06:34.757
-See you.
-See you.

06:34.927 --> 06:36.952
Bye, Dolores.

06:37.764 --> 06:39.061
I thought Mulva hated you.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.824
Yeah, so did l.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.228
You know what?

06:42.402 --> 06:44.336
I bet it was the engagement.

06:44.504 --> 06:46.904
I've shown I can go all the way.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.973
-All the way?
-Not our all the way.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.370
Their all the way.

06:50.543 --> 06:52.408
I got the stink
of responsibility on me.

06:52.578 --> 06:53.909
You were engaged for a minute.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.447
-I was engaged for a year.
-You stink worse than I do.

06:57.617 --> 07:00.450
I'm feeling
something else here, Jerry.

07:01.854 --> 07:03.788
Elaine, Mr. Peterman on line one.

07:03.956 --> 07:06.481
Hello, Mr. Peterman,
how are you feeling?

07:06.659 --> 07:10.254
Elaine, I'll be blunt.
I'm burnt out. I'm fried.

07:10.430 --> 07:13.331
My mind is as barren
as the surface of the moon.

07:14.233 --> 07:16.531
I can run that catalogue no longer.

07:16.702 --> 07:18.499
What? Who's gonna do it?

07:18.671 --> 07:20.764
-What about you?
-Me?

07:20.940 --> 07:23.773
-Why me?
-Why, indeed.

07:25.344 --> 07:27.209
Mr. Peterman, you can't leave.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.745
I've already left, Elaine.

07:28.915 --> 07:30.780
I'm in Burma.

07:31.851 --> 07:35.446
-Burma?
-You most likely know it as Myanmar.

07:35.621 --> 07:38.681
But it will always be Burma to me.

07:38.858 --> 07:40.120
Bonne chance, Elaine.

07:40.293 --> 07:44.855
You there, on the motorbike,
sell me one of your melons.

07:45.331 --> 07:46.662
Mr. Peterman?

07:46.833 --> 07:48.767
-Where?
-Burma.

07:48.935 --> 07:50.402
Isn't it Myanmar now?

07:50.570 --> 07:52.834
Jerry, he wants me
to run the catalogue.

07:53.005 --> 07:55.064
I mean, it's crazy.
I can't be in charge.

07:55.241 --> 07:56.833
No, certainly not.

07:57.009 --> 07:59.603
-I can't give people orders.
-No one's gonna listen to you.

07:59.779 --> 08:02.247
I am not qualified
to run the catalogue.

08:02.415 --> 08:05.680
You're not qualified
to work at the catalogue.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.119
Hey.

08:08.688 --> 08:11.555
-What's wrong?
-Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma.

08:11.724 --> 08:13.624
And now he wants me
to run the catalogue.

08:13.793 --> 08:16.125
-Where?
-Myanmar.

08:16.295 --> 08:18.195
Is that the discount pharmacy?

08:19.532 --> 08:21.432
Well, I'm just going to tell him no.

08:21.601 --> 08:23.034
I can't run the catalogue.

08:23.202 --> 08:25.329
Whoa, "can't"?

08:25.505 --> 08:27.905
When did that word
enter your vocabulary?

08:28.074 --> 08:29.666
What? Is the job too difficult?

08:30.643 --> 08:33.669
What? You don't have
enough experience?

08:33.846 --> 08:36.144
You're not smart enough?

08:36.315 --> 08:38.977
Where's your confidence?

08:39.150 --> 08:41.948
Elaine, let me tell you a story.

08:42.121 --> 08:44.681
-When I first started karate....
-Karate?

08:44.857 --> 08:47.087
Yeah, karate. I had no support.

08:47.260 --> 08:51.060
Not from him,
not from Newman, no one.

08:51.230 --> 08:54.563
First time I sparred
with an opponent I was terrified.

08:54.734 --> 08:57.567
My legs, they were like noodles.

08:57.737 --> 09:01.298
Then I looked inside,
and I found my katra.

09:01.774 --> 09:04.971
-"Katra"?
-Yeah, your spirit, your being.

09:05.144 --> 09:08.113
That part of you
that says, "Yes, I can."

09:08.281 --> 09:10.249
Sammy Davis had it.

09:12.018 --> 09:16.921
So I listened to my katra,
and now...I'm dominating the dojo.

09:17.957 --> 09:19.584
I'm class champion.

09:21.727 --> 09:24.890
Well, you know, I have watched
Peterman run the company.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.622
Sure, you have.

09:27.433 --> 09:28.764
I know how to do it.

09:28.935 --> 09:33.668
Pair of pants, stupid story,
a huge markup. I can do that.

09:33.839 --> 09:37.605
You follow your katra
and you can do anything.

09:37.777 --> 09:39.005
-Now get out of here.
-Okay.

09:41.681 --> 09:43.410
That kid is gonna be all right.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.244
No, she's not.

09:45.818 --> 09:47.979
Come on, Kramer.

09:48.220 --> 09:50.347
-Hey there.
-Come on.

09:50.523 --> 09:52.684
-Mom's down in the car.
-Okay, Joey.

09:52.858 --> 09:54.291
You have class at the same time?

09:54.460 --> 09:56.587
No, we're in the same class.

09:56.762 --> 09:58.127
You're in the same class?

09:58.297 --> 10:00.424
He almost beat me.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.761
Kramer, you're fighting children?

10:03.636 --> 10:06.662
We're all at the same
skill level, Jerry.

10:06.839 --> 10:08.431
He's 9 years old.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.304
You don't need karate.
You can just wring his neck.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.678
I got car pool.

10:16.182 --> 10:18.013
Thanks for the juice box, Mrs. Z.

10:19.018 --> 10:21.384
Hey, can we stop for ice cream
on the way home, Mom?

10:21.554 --> 10:22.851
-I don't know about--
-Please.

10:23.022 --> 10:26.788
-Please, please.
-Please. Please.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.950
-All right.
-Yeah!

10:31.330 --> 10:32.797
You're taking the job?

10:32.965 --> 10:34.489
You got that straight.

10:34.667 --> 10:37.465
Now, I want four new ideas
from each of you by 6:00.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.696
No, make that six ideas by 4:00.

10:39.872 --> 10:43.740
All right. Let's move.
Move! Move! Move!

10:47.480 --> 10:48.708
Are you prepared for kumite?

10:48.881 --> 10:50.143
-Yes, Sensei.
-Yes, Sensei.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.977
Fighting stance.

10:54.086 --> 10:55.644
Begin.

11:12.471 --> 11:13.995
Winner.

11:18.878 --> 11:20.436
It's open.

11:23.916 --> 11:26.680
-Rosses.
-Hello, George.

11:27.153 --> 11:29.087
Come in. Come in.

11:29.255 --> 11:31.314
We tried to call,
but the line was busy.

11:31.490 --> 11:33.685
Oh, oh, yeah. Sure, sure.

11:33.859 --> 11:35.759
Sit down, please.

11:35.928 --> 11:37.691
Cheese there?

11:38.597 --> 11:41.259
We know the last three months
have been hard on you.

11:41.434 --> 11:44.403
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Very, very hard.

11:44.570 --> 11:47.038
And they've been hard on us too.

11:47.206 --> 11:50.369
It's a terrible tragedy
when parents outlive their children.

11:50.543 --> 11:54.980
Yes, I agree. I hope my parents
go long before I do.

11:55.614 --> 11:58.674
That's why we decided
to create a foundation...

11:58.851 --> 12:01.081
...to preserve Susan's memory.

12:01.253 --> 12:03.551
Oh, that's wonderful.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.487
And, of course, we want you
to be an integral part.

12:06.659 --> 12:08.650
Yes, integ--

12:09.328 --> 12:11.592
How--? How integral?

12:11.764 --> 12:13.425
You'll be on the board of directors.

12:13.599 --> 12:16.830
Great. Great.

12:17.002 --> 12:21.029
Oh, oh, oh, gosh,
you know, it's just....

12:21.207 --> 12:22.640
My duties with the Yankees--

12:22.808 --> 12:24.969
Oh, don't worry, George.

12:25.144 --> 12:28.307
The foundation will revolve
around your schedule.

12:28.481 --> 12:32.645
Evening, weekends,
whenever you have free time.

12:34.453 --> 12:36.921
I can't believe this is happening.

12:37.089 --> 12:40.252
Well, it wouldn't have without
your friend Jerry's inspirational words.

12:41.193 --> 12:46.460
He said to us, "She's not really
dead if her shadow is--"

12:47.433 --> 12:50.334
-What was it, dear?
-Something about a way, wasn't it?

12:50.503 --> 12:52.903
And a light and a--

12:54.173 --> 12:56.300
Who the hell knows.

12:56.942 --> 12:59.775
But what's important is that
your relationship with Susan...

12:59.945 --> 13:01.708
...doesn't have to end.

13:01.881 --> 13:04.509
So will you be sure
to thank Jerry for us?

13:04.683 --> 13:07.846
The second I see him.

13:17.396 --> 13:19.728
-Hey.
-Hey.

13:20.299 --> 13:21.527
How's your day? Good?

13:21.700 --> 13:24.794
Actually, yeah, I'm meeting Mulva
here in a few minutes.

13:25.538 --> 13:26.869
So...

13:27.039 --> 13:28.131
...Wrath of Khan?

13:28.307 --> 13:30.537
Yeah, was that a beauty or what?

13:32.144 --> 13:36.205
What was that line again? Something
about finding your way in a shadow?

13:36.382 --> 13:41.251
No, no, no, it's, "She's not really dead
if we find a way to remember her."

13:41.420 --> 13:42.648
That's it.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.983
That's the line...

13:45.624 --> 13:48.752
...that destroyed my life.

13:51.564 --> 13:52.963
Problem?

13:53.399 --> 13:55.264
The Rosses have started up
a foundation...

13:55.434 --> 13:57.527
...and I have to sit
on the board of directors.

13:57.703 --> 13:59.694
Hey, board of directors, look at you.

13:59.872 --> 14:02.966
Yeah, look at me.
I was free and clear.

14:03.142 --> 14:05.406
I was living the dream.
Stripped to the waist...

14:05.578 --> 14:08.741
...eating a block of cheese
the size of a car battery.

14:08.914 --> 14:12.281
Before we go any further, I'd just like
to point out how disturbing it is...

14:12.451 --> 14:14.578
...that you equate
eating a block of cheese...

14:14.753 --> 14:17.313
...with some sort
of bachelor paradise.

14:17.790 --> 14:20.122
Don't you see? I'm back in.

14:20.292 --> 14:22.522
-All because of Wrath of Khan?
-Yes.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.027
Well, it was the best
of those movies.

14:27.099 --> 14:31.866
Khan!

14:37.409 --> 14:38.967
George?

14:41.213 --> 14:42.737
George?

14:43.148 --> 14:44.979
I'm Wyck Thayer, chairman of...

14:45.150 --> 14:47.175
-...the Susan Ross Foundation.
-Wink?

14:47.353 --> 14:49.344
-Wyck.
-Wyck.

14:50.089 --> 14:53.149
Now, as you know, the Rosses
had considerable monies.

14:53.325 --> 14:55.657
Well, l-- I know
they have some monies.

14:55.828 --> 14:59.025
They had more than some monies.
Many, many monies.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.996
And they planned to give
a sizable portion of their estate...

15:04.169 --> 15:06.501
...to you and Susan
after the wedding.

15:07.039 --> 15:09.633
So if Susan and I had--

15:09.808 --> 15:13.471
I mean, if the envelopes hadn't....

15:13.646 --> 15:15.841
-Then we....
-Yes.

15:16.015 --> 15:18.347
-And now?
-Not.

15:18.717 --> 15:21.345
It's all been endowed
to the foundation.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.489
-Even this townhouse.
-This townhouse?

15:24.657 --> 15:26.818
Yes, this would
have been your wedding gift.

15:26.992 --> 15:28.289
-And now?
-Not.

15:28.460 --> 15:29.757
Not.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.655
Also endowed.

15:33.632 --> 15:37.500
George, I know how much
Susan meant to you.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.069
This can't be easy.

15:39.238 --> 15:41.331
You know, it really can't.

15:43.142 --> 15:44.370
So who broke it off?

15:44.543 --> 15:46.135
That's the thing. It was mutual.

15:46.312 --> 15:48.644
Oh, come on. Everybody knows
there's no such thing...

15:48.814 --> 15:50.304
...as a mutual breakup.

15:50.482 --> 15:52.541
-Tell me the truth.
-I am.

15:52.718 --> 15:54.185
It was the world's first.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.785
You know, when
I heard you got engaged...

15:56.956 --> 16:00.949
...I thought maybe you'd matured,
but obviously there's no growth here.

16:01.126 --> 16:05.119
I can't argue with that, but the fact
remains I was completely....

16:06.098 --> 16:07.463
Mulva.

16:18.277 --> 16:21.303
-Hello.
-Please hold for Elaine Benes.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.971
Oh, I don't believe this.

16:25.684 --> 16:27.345
-Jerry?
-Hey.

16:27.519 --> 16:31.319
Hey, guess who just finished
laying out her first issue...

16:31.490 --> 16:33.321
...of the J. Peterman Catalogue.

16:33.492 --> 16:34.982
-How does it look?
-It's a peach.

16:35.160 --> 16:38.493
-What's that?
-I say, it's a peach.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.599
Let me ask you something. When
I told you my breakup was mutual...

16:41.767 --> 16:43.530
-...did you believe me?
-No, no, no.

16:43.702 --> 16:47.069
It's weak. No one's gonna buy it,
and you shouldn't be selling it.

16:47.239 --> 16:48.900
I gotta do some research here.

16:49.074 --> 16:52.339
Hey, hey. Me, talking?

16:53.679 --> 16:54.839
You know...

16:55.014 --> 16:56.914
...between you and me...

16:57.082 --> 17:01.109
...I always thought Kramer
was a bit of a doofus.

17:01.286 --> 17:03.880
But he believed in me.

17:04.056 --> 17:05.284
You did not.

17:05.457 --> 17:08.756
So as I see it,
he's not the doofus...

17:08.926 --> 17:11.020
...you are the doofus.

17:11.195 --> 17:13.130
-Oh, I'm the doofus?
-Yes.

17:13.298 --> 17:16.893
You, Jerry, are the doofus.

17:17.069 --> 17:20.800
You know, it occurs to me
that Kramer is at karate right now.

17:21.173 --> 17:24.108
Well, maybe I'll just go down there
and thank him in person.

17:24.276 --> 17:26.368
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.108
Kramer?

17:34.219 --> 17:35.618
-Elaine.
-What are you doing?

17:35.788 --> 17:38.279
Well, I'm-- I'm dominating.

17:39.491 --> 17:41.220
You never said
you're fighting children.

17:41.393 --> 17:44.419
Well, it's not the size
of the opponent, Elaine.

17:44.596 --> 17:46.894
It's the ferocity.

17:47.666 --> 17:49.691
This is what you used
to build me up?

17:49.868 --> 17:52.462
This is where you got
all that stupid "katra" stuff?

17:52.638 --> 17:55.630
No, no, no, that's from Star Trek III.

17:56.241 --> 18:00.337
-The Search for Spock.
-Search for Spock?

18:00.512 --> 18:03.413
Yeah, yeah, I know. Jerry will tell you
that the Wrath of Khan...

18:03.582 --> 18:07.109
-...is the better picture, but for me, l--
-You doofus.

18:13.659 --> 18:14.887
Okay, question number eight:

18:15.060 --> 18:18.461
What if I told you my fiancée
left me for another man?

18:18.630 --> 18:21.793
Does that make me more likable,
less likable, as likable?

18:21.967 --> 18:23.434
Let's start over here this time.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.326
More.

18:25.504 --> 18:27.165
Less.

18:27.339 --> 18:30.706
-Same.
-Are we about through here?

18:36.014 --> 18:38.676
I thought you said your mom
was meeting us in the alley.

18:38.851 --> 18:42.218
She had a little change of plans.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.852
What's going on?

18:46.024 --> 18:47.787
Hey, Timmy, Clara.

18:48.594 --> 18:51.062
That was some kind of workout
we had tonight, huh?

18:51.230 --> 18:52.857
Now we finish it.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.866
Get him.

18:57.035 --> 18:58.900
Mama!

19:01.874 --> 19:04.069
I wouldn't eat anything
you caught in that pond...

19:04.243 --> 19:06.302
...out in front of the condo.

19:07.446 --> 19:09.937
All right. Look, Elaine's here.
I gotta get going.

19:10.115 --> 19:14.211
By the way, I'm not getting married.
Tell Mom. Bye.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.881
So....

19:22.027 --> 19:25.155
-Did you stop by the dojo?
-Yup.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.491
-How's your confidence level?
-Shot.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.657
-Self-esteem?
-Gone.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.167
Doofus?

19:32.938 --> 19:35.065
All right. So what?

19:35.240 --> 19:37.538
You put out the catalogue.
How bad could it be?

19:44.650 --> 19:46.083
What is that?

19:46.885 --> 19:49.376
The urban sombrero.

19:49.955 --> 19:51.513
I put it on the cover.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.627
Well, nobody sees the cover.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.190
What happened to you?

19:59.364 --> 20:00.991
I got whupped.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.933
You should have seen
the rage in their little eyes.

20:04.102 --> 20:07.868
And those tiny little fists of fury.

20:10.542 --> 20:11.770
What is that?

20:12.578 --> 20:14.944
It's the new cover
of the J. Peterman catalogue.

20:15.113 --> 20:16.876
It is Elaine's choice.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.277
Let's congratulate her.

20:20.586 --> 20:22.554
This is all your fault.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.712
You told me
I could run the company.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.950
Well, then I was way off.

20:28.493 --> 20:30.154
Well, I'll see you.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.158
I gotta go lay down.

20:36.335 --> 20:37.893
Are you and George
going out later?

20:38.070 --> 20:39.731
No, he's still stuck
at the foundation.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.873
You ought to go down there
and help him out.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.473
He's a widower.

20:43.642 --> 20:47.009
Widower? Wait a second.

20:48.513 --> 20:52.882
Okay, let's see. The beach house,
48 acres, Southampton.

20:53.051 --> 20:54.780
That should fetch a fair price.

20:55.387 --> 20:58.584
-Would I have had access to that?
-Of course. Would have been yours.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.247
And now?

21:00.425 --> 21:01.756
Not.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.520
Got it.

21:08.567 --> 21:10.194
-Hello.
-Hey, Georgie.

21:10.369 --> 21:12.234
I'm doing some research
at the coffee shop.

21:12.404 --> 21:13.837
Your story's the one.

21:14.006 --> 21:15.701
-My story?
-Yeah, your widower story...

21:15.874 --> 21:17.432
...has tested through the roof.

21:19.678 --> 21:21.737
When are you getting out of there?

21:22.047 --> 21:25.278
Excuse me, Wyck,
are we almost done here?

21:25.450 --> 21:28.681
No, no, not even close.

21:33.525 --> 21:34.787
I can't go.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.723
What do you mean, you can't go?

21:36.895 --> 21:40.228
There's two really cute girls sitting
at the counter eating grilled cheese.

21:40.399 --> 21:41.696
Cheese, George.

21:41.867 --> 21:43.858
Cheese.

21:44.036 --> 21:47.301
Okay, next item,
Susan's doll collection.

21:47.472 --> 21:51.067
Estimated value, 2.6 million.

21:51.243 --> 21:54.303
What do you say
we go through this doll by doll.

22:10.796 --> 22:12.320
It was nothing unusual.

22:12.497 --> 22:14.692
Every afternoon
for the last 24 years...

22:14.866 --> 22:17.664
...I'd shut the door to my office
and sneak a little shuteye.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.326
No one was the wiser.

22:19.504 --> 22:23.838
But then my wife
gets me this urban sombrero.

22:24.009 --> 22:26.978
The next thing I know,
my ass is out on the street.

22:27.145 --> 22:28.976
I tried one too.

22:29.147 --> 22:32.275
I woke up and found
my walking papers tacked to the brim.

22:32.451 --> 22:34.612
Stupid J. Pendleton.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.617
It's "Peterman."

22:37.789 --> 22:40.087
It's J. Peterman.

22:41.093 --> 22:43.857
I never thought
a hat would destroy my life.
