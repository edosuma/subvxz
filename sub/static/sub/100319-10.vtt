00:08.359 --> 00:10.501
- Oh, look, he's alive.

00:10.601 --> 00:12.463
- I was getting worried.

00:12.563 --> 00:14.945
I haven't heard a word
from Simon

00:15.045 --> 00:16.306
since he got on that elevator
with Jessica.

00:16.406 --> 00:17.947
I thought maybe
she shanked him.

00:18.047 --> 00:19.749
- As Eddie describes it,
it was very amicable.

00:19.849 --> 00:22.711
I mean, the Brits don't
scream and yell like we do.

00:22.811 --> 00:24.072
- Seems like Simon's finally
coming up for air.

00:24.172 --> 00:26.594
It says here,
"A new day begins.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.516
Looking forward
to looking forward."

00:28.616 --> 00:29.997
- See, that just makes me
want to shank him.

00:30.097 --> 00:31.278
- What do I do now?

00:31.378 --> 00:32.919
I have no idea how
I'm supposed to be around him.

00:33.019 --> 00:34.761
I mean, he doesn't know
that I know they broke up.

00:34.861 --> 00:35.582
- And I know that you know
that he's gonna run to you

00:35.662 --> 00:37.723
and tell you at work.

00:37.823 --> 00:39.525
- Okay, but what is
the right way

00:39.625 --> 00:42.527
to approach
this kind of situation?

00:42.627 --> 00:44.529
I mean, I really feel bad
for them both.

00:44.629 --> 00:47.211
It's not like--
it's not like I won.

00:47.311 --> 00:48.933
- Oh, no, baby,
you definitely won.

00:49.033 --> 00:50.974
- How do I react when he
tells me that they broke up?

00:51.074 --> 00:52.416
Should I be concerned?

00:52.516 --> 00:55.098
Sympathetic?
Respectfully somber?

00:55.198 --> 00:57.740
- You act like a human
would act to a human.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.982
The boy just broke up with
his fiancée four days ago.

01:00.082 --> 01:02.144
He'll come to you
when he's ready.

01:02.244 --> 01:03.144
Just play it cool.

01:03.244 --> 01:04.305
- How do I do that?

01:04.405 --> 01:06.347
- It's all in the attitude.
Sit.

01:06.447 --> 01:09.750
How about we say
something comforting like...

01:09.850 --> 01:11.231
"Hey."

01:11.331 --> 01:13.333
- Hey.
- No.

01:14.534 --> 01:15.675
- Hey.
- No.

01:15.775 --> 01:17.776
- [sexy] Hey.
- No.

01:19.458 --> 01:21.279
- [shortly] Hey.
- Zoey.

01:21.379 --> 01:23.121
- You know what?
I'm just gonna wing it.

01:23.221 --> 01:24.282
- [drawn out] Hey...

01:24.382 --> 01:26.383
- Stop it.

01:29.666 --> 01:31.668
- Morning.

01:33.629 --> 01:36.812
Stopping by for a little quality
Dad time on my way to work.

- [quiet grunt]

01:41.116 --> 01:43.117

01:44.318 --> 01:45.659
Maybe a little tired?

01:45.759 --> 01:46.900
- [quiet grunt]

01:47.000 --> 01:48.502
- Just write them back

01:48.602 --> 01:49.503
and tell them
you have to cancel.

01:49.603 --> 01:51.384
- Cancel what?

01:51.484 --> 01:52.985
- Medici.
They just emailed

01:53.085 --> 01:55.988
confirming our reservation
for Friday night.

01:56.088 --> 01:57.789
Same table every year.

01:57.889 --> 01:59.111
- Oh, my God, I totally forgot.

01:59.211 --> 02:00.712
It's almost your anniversary.

02:00.812 --> 02:02.673
- [sighs]
I think we all forgot.

02:02.773 --> 02:05.516
We've been a little
preoccupied around here.

02:05.616 --> 02:08.118
- Why do you have to cancel?
Maybe Dad still wants to go.

02:08.218 --> 02:09.679
- You really think he's
in any condition

02:09.779 --> 02:10.920
to go out to a restaurant
right now?

02:11.020 --> 02:12.522
- I don't know, but it's Medici.

02:12.622 --> 02:13.703
Mom and Dad
have been celebrating there

02:13.783 --> 02:15.284
for as long as I can remember.

02:15.384 --> 02:17.205
- It is a special place,
and we've had

02:17.305 --> 02:20.408
a lot of great nights there,
but, um, your father--

02:20.508 --> 02:21.969
- Loves their tomato soup.

02:22.069 --> 02:23.130
He could still eat that.

02:23.230 --> 02:26.493
- Howie?
What do you think?

02:26.593 --> 02:30.336
- Well, your dad is
slowing down, sleeping more.

02:30.436 --> 02:32.858
But if you guys want to go,
I am happy to help.

02:32.958 --> 02:34.900
- See?

02:35.000 --> 02:37.662
Howie thinks it a good idea.
- That place is tiny.

02:37.762 --> 02:40.064
I mean, you sure his
wheelchair's even gonna fit?

02:40.164 --> 02:41.506
- I'll call them and see
if they'll make room,

02:41.606 --> 02:44.508
and if they do,
will you guys go?

02:44.608 --> 02:47.591
- It's up to your father.
I'm happy to do

02:47.691 --> 02:51.153
whatever it is he wants.
What do you think, honey?

02:51.253 --> 02:53.255
- [soft grunt]

02:55.457 --> 02:58.680
- Great. You guys don't have
to worry about a thing.

02:58.780 --> 03:00.721
I've got it handled.

This is 2020.
How is that even allowed?

Hello? Mr. Michele,
where'd you go?

03:11.550 --> 03:14.393
Mr. Michele?
Mr. Michele?

03:16.234 --> 03:18.056
Oh, no.
Is today really the day?

03:18.156 --> 03:19.777
- If you're talking
about the day

03:19.877 --> 03:21.298
where I move up
to the 6th floor

03:21.398 --> 03:22.740
and no one even looks up
from their computers

03:22.840 --> 03:26.903
to say goodbye, then yes.
Today's the day.

03:27.003 --> 03:28.664
- Sorry, I was gonna
get you a gift,

03:28.764 --> 03:30.866
like a fancy pen
or an even-fancier mouse.

03:30.966 --> 03:33.208
- Well, it's
the almost-thought that counts.

03:34.849 --> 03:36.551
I guess this is goodbye, huh?

03:36.651 --> 03:38.633
- I guess so.
It's gonna be

03:38.733 --> 03:40.554
really weird not seeing
your face every day.

03:40.654 --> 03:43.817
- Yeah. Super weird.

03:47.260 --> 03:49.482
- What are we doing?
It's only two floors up.

03:49.582 --> 03:50.803
- Yeah, two floors.
That's nothing.

Yes, what are we doing?
This is ridiculous.

How was your long weekend?

05:18.255 --> 05:19.876
- Oh, you know, typical.

05:19.976 --> 05:21.638
I was at a conference
with a bunch of billionaires

getting tipsy and prank calling
that Theranos woman.

So, I couldn't help but notice

05:26.782 --> 05:28.323
that Leif called in sick
the same days you were gone.

- And?

05:29.504 --> 05:32.006
- And...it's possible

one may have inferred
that you two were...

05:36.430 --> 05:37.691

Now, can we please
stop speaking "Zoey"?

05:43.235 --> 05:45.237
- Sorry.

05:45.958 --> 05:47.979
It's just, I thought you said
you were gonna end it with him.

05:48.079 --> 05:49.981
- Oh, my God, we did,
basically.

05:50.081 --> 05:51.582
It's light and casual.

05:51.682 --> 05:53.224
He's a millennial--they're
apathetic and non-committal.

05:53.324 --> 05:54.905
It's a beautiful thing.

05:55.005 --> 05:57.427

Sorry, Joan.
I know you and Ava

06:19.986 --> 06:21.407

over the years.

any better,

hired me for this job.

to know.

way before you and I met.

and really discuss stuff.

with Ava Price?

09:18.973 --> 09:20.515
- Why would you say that?

09:20.615 --> 09:22.316

is the fastest way

to career advancement.
Everyone knows that.

- Yes?
- I know that you said that

11:34.205 --> 11:35.946
your relationship with Leif
was purely casual,

11:36.046 --> 11:39.870
but...he is
madly in love with you.

11:39.970 --> 11:41.471
- What do you mean?
That's terrible news.

11:41.571 --> 11:42.992
H-h-how do you know?
What did he say?

11:43.092 --> 11:44.233
What were his words exactly?

11:44.333 --> 11:46.515
- Well, from what I gathered,
he...

11:46.615 --> 11:49.317
is in it for the long haul.
Happy, sad, good, bad.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.719
- Oh, God.
- I want you to be careful

11:50.819 --> 11:53.361
because I know
that workplace romances

11:53.461 --> 11:54.362
can get a little dicey.

11:54.462 --> 11:55.963
- Sorry to interrupt. Um...

11:56.063 --> 11:57.644
I'm running out.
Is 8:00 okay?

11:57.744 --> 11:59.966
- Yeah, sure.

12:00.066 --> 12:02.068
Works for me.

12:04.910 --> 12:07.452
Uh, and I just want you
to protect yourself,

12:07.552 --> 12:09.774
'cause you're his boss,
and...

12:12.236 --> 12:14.178

12:14.278 --> 12:16.300
- Hi.
- Ooh.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.401
[whispers]
I'll let myself out.

12:18.922 --> 12:22.305
- Hi. Um...
I think we need to have a--

12:22.405 --> 12:24.747
um, a heart-to-heart.
- Yeah, I'd love to.

12:24.847 --> 12:27.429
But first,
before we get to that,

12:27.529 --> 12:31.152
all of Max's files for The Chirp
have been deleted off the Git,

12:31.252 --> 12:33.234
and we can't run the next phase
without his DSP.

12:33.334 --> 12:36.276
- Okay, well, go up to
the 6th floor and get them.

12:36.376 --> 12:38.118
- No problem. Um...

12:38.218 --> 12:40.119
It's just,
I'd need an access card,

12:40.219 --> 12:41.841
and you're the only one
who has it,

12:41.941 --> 12:45.404
and, I don't know, I thought
we'd, like, go together.

12:45.504 --> 12:48.166
- No. No, no. Can't--
can't--can't do it together.

12:48.266 --> 12:50.928
D-definitely not, but, um,
here, I've gotta work,

12:51.028 --> 12:52.850
and y-you have your whole life
ahead of you.

12:52.950 --> 12:54.951
Okay?
- Uh--

12:57.794 --> 13:00.176
- Dude, thanks so much
for letting me come with.

13:00.276 --> 13:01.537
I've always
wanted to come up here,

13:01.637 --> 13:03.298
ever since they told me I wasn't
allowed to come up here.

13:03.398 --> 13:05.060
- Uh, dude, we're kind of
on a mission.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.162
- Let me touch it again.

13:09.403 --> 13:11.545
What?
They get a giant seafood tower,

13:11.645 --> 13:13.067
and we get an oatmeal bar?

13:13.167 --> 13:15.168
I'll be right back.

13:17.250 --> 13:18.671
- Leif, what are you
doing here?

13:18.771 --> 13:20.713
- Well, we can't work
on The Chirp

13:20.813 --> 13:24.356
because your config files aren't
in the Git repository anymore.

13:24.456 --> 13:26.457
- That's weird.

13:29.300 --> 13:30.921
Must be for security reasons.

13:31.021 --> 13:32.803
- Aren't you one
of Joan's programmers?

13:32.903 --> 13:36.246
- Yes, Ms. Price.
Leif Donnelly.

Joan's best programmer.

13:37.867 --> 13:40.129
I'm just here to retrieve
Max's files on The Chirp.

13:40.229 --> 13:42.411
- Oh, The Chirp.
How's that going?

13:42.511 --> 13:43.612
- Incredible, actually.

13:43.712 --> 13:45.093
- Incredible in what way?

13:45.193 --> 13:47.135
- In every way.
The Chirp is going to have

13:47.235 --> 13:49.336
a state-of-the-art
user interface,

13:49.436 --> 13:51.418
amazing data visualizations.

13:51.518 --> 13:52.939
We're just scratching
the surface

13:53.039 --> 13:54.781
of what it's truly capable of,
and it could be

13:57.003 --> 13:58.664
Max, the files?
[cell phone chimes]

13:58.764 --> 14:00.586
- Don't give it to him, Max.

14:00.686 --> 14:02.587
- Why not?
- Because he just reminded me

14:02.687 --> 14:05.590
how impressive The Chirp is,
so I texted Danny Michael Davis

14:05.690 --> 14:07.952
and convinced him to let
Floor 6 work on it as well.

14:08.052 --> 14:09.593
- You texted him
while we were talking?

14:09.693 --> 14:11.435
And he's letting your floor
work on it as well?

14:11.535 --> 14:13.636
That's, um--that sounds like--
- That's right.

14:13.736 --> 14:14.837
It's a bake-off, people!

14:14.937 --> 14:16.399
[all cheer]

14:16.499 --> 14:18.080
You're forbidden from giving
those files to Leif

14:18.180 --> 14:20.002
or anyone else
on the 4th floor.

14:20.102 --> 14:22.183
- Okay.
- Dude, what just happened?

14:25.907 --> 14:27.908
[knocking]

14:29.469 --> 14:31.171
- Wow, you look nice.
- Thanks.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.973
I brought you a fern,

14:34.073 --> 14:36.615
because I have no idea
what's appropriate right now

14:36.715 --> 14:39.178
and I thought it seemed
delightfully neutral.

14:39.278 --> 14:41.279
- Hmm. [chuckles]

14:42.280 --> 14:43.741
- Not bad.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.383
- Well, all the apartments
here are pre-furnished.

14:45.483 --> 14:48.425
That's why all my neighbors
are widowers and divorcées.

14:48.525 --> 14:51.868
I do get a lot of nods of
understanding and hugs.

14:51.968 --> 14:54.150
Do you want a glass of wine?

14:54.250 --> 14:56.252
- Love a glass of wine.

14:57.092 --> 14:59.094
[wine pouring]

15:03.017 --> 15:05.339
- [exhales]
To looking forward.

15:06.980 --> 15:09.382
- To looking forward.
[classes clink]

15:22.273 --> 15:24.855
So...

15:24.955 --> 15:26.417
Here we are.

15:26.517 --> 15:28.518
- Yeah, we sure are.

15:32.041 --> 15:33.783
I have a teeny bit
of bad news.

15:33.883 --> 15:36.945
- Then I'll only be
a teeny bit worried?

15:37.045 --> 15:38.547
I couldn't find
my pasta strainer

15:38.647 --> 15:40.048
so I think I'm gonna have to use
the tennis racquet method.

15:40.128 --> 15:42.990
- Isn't that the best way
to serve?

15:43.090 --> 15:46.913
- Ooh. Mmm. Yeah.
- Sorry.

15:47.013 --> 15:48.355
- I'll be right back.

15:48.455 --> 15:49.616
You make yourself at home
with these magazines

the right night

17:52.557 --> 17:53.378
for us to hang out.

full reprise. That's amazing.

maybe,

18:15.976 --> 18:17.197

have to be "Mad World"?

- Don't you get it, Mo?

18:22.141 --> 18:24.003
After everything we've
been through,

18:24.103 --> 18:26.205
all the emotional ground
we've covered,

18:26.305 --> 18:29.608
it really seemed like Simon
was finally in a good place.

18:29.708 --> 18:31.329
But nothing's changed.

18:31.429 --> 18:33.531
He's exactly how he was
when we first met.

18:33.631 --> 18:36.373
- Look, we tried,
but if you ask me

18:36.473 --> 18:39.095
that boy has been nothing
but drama since minute one.

18:39.195 --> 18:41.337

get off the Simon train

18:41.437 --> 18:42.618
and get on with your life.

and I help him even more.

18:45.280 --> 18:48.183
- [laughs]
That's funny.

18:48.283 --> 18:49.504
And you're not joking.

18:49.604 --> 18:50.625
- I can't desert him, Mo.
He needs me.

18:50.725 --> 18:53.067
- You know what?
I don't need this.

18:53.167 --> 18:55.069
- What are you talking about?
- It is emotionally exhausting

18:55.169 --> 18:57.351

backwards and forwards

so no, I am not about to help
you unravel this mess.

- Fine! Don't help me!

19:06.458 --> 19:08.760
I'll unravel it myself.

try my cooking

19:17.667 --> 19:19.449

19:19.549 --> 19:23.212
- I see you. I hear you.

19:23.312 --> 19:26.014
I'm not saying
I handled it well.

19:26.114 --> 19:28.416
- Care to tell me
what was going on there?

19:28.516 --> 19:32.179
- Well, you know
that thing about

19:32.279 --> 19:34.621
how I just know how
to read you?

19:34.721 --> 19:37.183
- [chuckles quietly]
- I could tell that

19:37.283 --> 19:39.385
you weren't in a place
to focus on us last night.

19:39.485 --> 19:41.227
- You could tell that, huh?
- I could.

19:41.327 --> 19:42.368
- I thought I was
covering it pretty well.

19:42.448 --> 19:44.449
- You weren't.

19:50.454 --> 19:52.796
- I really wanted it
to be a nice night.

19:52.896 --> 19:55.078
But right before you came over,

19:55.178 --> 19:57.000
my mom called,
out of the blue.

19:57.100 --> 19:59.482
- I don't think you've
ever mentioned her before.

19:59.582 --> 20:02.805
- We don't talk much lately.

20:02.905 --> 20:06.247
Anyway, she called to tell me
that she's getting remarried.

20:06.347 --> 20:08.809
This weekend, in Vegas,
and she wants me to come.

20:08.909 --> 20:11.732
- And I'm guessing you're
not very happy

20:11.832 --> 20:13.613
for the blushing bride.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.935
- I know she's not responsible
for my father killing himself,

20:16.035 --> 20:18.497
but I'm not sure she was
helping matters either.

20:18.597 --> 20:20.219
Their marriage was rough,

20:20.319 --> 20:21.700
but she wasn't very supportive

20:21.800 --> 20:23.101
during some of
his darker moments

20:23.201 --> 20:25.143
and now, just like that,
she's moving on.

20:25.243 --> 20:27.905
I feel like I should be
defending my dad

20:28.005 --> 20:29.507
or sticking up for him
or something.

20:29.607 --> 20:32.469
I don't know if I'm
upset or angry.

20:32.569 --> 20:34.571
- Or just totally stuck?

20:36.092 --> 20:37.553
I don't mean to be
insensitive.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.114
It just feels like we have been
covering this terrain

20:39.214 --> 20:40.716
for a long time now, and--

20:40.816 --> 20:42.277
- Suddenly there's a time limit
on grieving.

20:42.377 --> 20:44.319
- Zoey, walk with me.

20:44.419 --> 20:46.420
- I'm in the middle--
- It's okay, it can wait.

20:50.864 --> 20:52.405
- What's wrong?
Did things go bad with Leif?

20:52.505 --> 20:54.287
- It's not about that.
I sent Leif up to the 6th floor

20:54.387 --> 20:55.728
to get the files back from Max,

20:55.828 --> 20:57.209
and now we've been dragged
into a bake-off.

20:57.309 --> 20:59.611
- A bake-off?
- Yes. The first team

20:59.711 --> 21:01.693
to get a working prototype
to Danny Michael Davis

21:01.793 --> 21:04.696
wins stock options, bonuses--
- All the best assignments.

21:04.796 --> 21:06.697
- Access to Danny's
underground compound

21:06.797 --> 21:08.058
in the case of nuclear war.

21:08.158 --> 21:09.860
We have gotta get those files
back from Max.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.061
- Well, why won't he
just give them to us?

21:11.161 --> 21:12.182
We worked on the DSP together.

21:12.282 --> 21:13.703
- [scoffs] Well, clearly,

21:13.803 --> 21:15.264
because Ava's got her hooks
in him.

21:15.364 --> 21:17.746
How did she lure him away?
- There was no luring.

21:17.846 --> 21:19.788
Ava wanted him,
he wanted to go, I said okay.

21:19.888 --> 21:21.710
- We didn't sign anything,
right? No transfer paperwork?

21:21.810 --> 21:23.031
- No.
- Okay, we have gotta get

21:23.131 --> 21:24.552
those files back from Max.

21:24.652 --> 21:25.713
- Can I come too? Please?

21:25.813 --> 21:27.815
- I need my access card.

21:39.264 --> 21:41.566
- Yo, you guys, there's gonna be
a smackdown on the 6th floor!

21:41.666 --> 21:43.668
Let's go!

22:02.243 --> 22:03.984
- Max, you're coming with us.

22:04.084 --> 22:08.949
- No, he's staying right here.
- What's going on?

22:09.049 --> 22:10.310
- You didn't apply
for a transfer, Ava.

22:10.410 --> 22:11.471
Max doesn't belong to you.

22:11.571 --> 22:12.792
- He doesn't belong to anyone.

22:12.892 --> 22:14.873
Max came upstairs
because we value him.

22:14.973 --> 22:16.355
He wants to work with us.

22:16.455 --> 22:18.556
- Well, he was with us first,

22:18.656 --> 22:20.999
and you only recruited him
because of his Chirp files.

22:21.099 --> 22:23.120
- The fact that Max's work
proved pivotal in the project

22:23.220 --> 22:26.803
was a happy accident
and only reinforces the fact

22:26.903 --> 22:29.085
that I have an eye for talent.

22:29.185 --> 22:30.727
- Okay, you're not Simon Cowell.

22:30.827 --> 22:32.168
Uh, give him back.

22:32.268 --> 22:34.249
- He's not going anywhere.

what I think?

24:36.891 --> 24:38.112
Which floor I work on

It's not really up to you guys.

tell us what you would like.

24:52.383 --> 24:54.385
- Yes, tell us.

24:55.546 --> 24:57.488
- Well, uh, to be honest,
my first instinct

24:57.588 --> 25:00.610
was to go back to the 4th floor
and give them the code

25:00.710 --> 25:02.211
since that's where
it originated.

25:02.311 --> 25:03.533
- That's great, Maxie.

25:03.633 --> 25:05.494
Follow your instinct.
I taught him that.

wanted me there.

He could've handled it better
and he knows it.

have you thought about

26:06.645 --> 26:08.266

26:08.366 --> 26:10.788

- I was just taking care of me.
Wasn't personal.

28:50.940 --> 28:52.241

my powers, I also told you

100% honest with you.

I think it is personal.

28:57.225 --> 28:59.047

You are mad at me for not saying
what you wanted to hear,

me some kind of lesson.

for a whopping two days!

in the last five years?

Oh, and it's also
a huge opportunity

29:20.605 --> 29:21.926

ever thought about that?

29:29.252 --> 29:31.253

Just FYI.

I'm a good person.

going on with my dad?

of rough nights, so,

- You what?

31:19.703 --> 31:21.965
How are we supposed
to communicate with him?

31:22.065 --> 31:23.966
I don't have much time left
with my father.

31:24.066 --> 31:25.928
Why would you purposely

31:26.028 --> 31:28.290
make him more out of it
than he already is?

31:28.390 --> 31:30.972
- Your mom and I thought he
could use a good night's sleep.

31:31.072 --> 31:34.215
- And rob him of some of
the last moments of clarity?

31:34.315 --> 31:37.458
If he could communicate with me
right now I could help him!

31:37.558 --> 31:39.739
But you made that impossible!
It's stupid!

31:39.839 --> 31:41.461
Why would you give him
a sedative?!

31:41.561 --> 31:43.603
- Could I speak to you
privately for a moment?

31:49.688 --> 31:52.150
We do not speak to people
that way in our house.

31:52.250 --> 31:53.711

acting so...

31:57.534 --> 31:58.635

with being polite.

- Okay, I'm leaving.

32:05.941 --> 32:07.883

really upset on the phone.

32:09.944 --> 32:11.946
