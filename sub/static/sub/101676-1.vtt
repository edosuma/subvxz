WEBVTT

01:39.900 --> 01:40.901
Hey.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.103
You didn't wake me.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.239
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.010
Do you want some coffee?

01:50.044 --> 01:50.844
Mm-hmm.

01:54.915 --> 01:55.949
That's no good.

01:57.051 --> 01:58.152
Something you ate?

01:58.185 --> 01:59.987
Yeah, maybe it
was your cooking.

02:00.020 --> 02:00.921
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

02:01.922 --> 02:02.890
Probably.

02:02.923 --> 02:03.957
Shut up.

02:05.059 --> 02:05.893
Go on, sit down.

02:06.927 --> 02:07.928
What's all this?

02:07.961 --> 02:08.862
It's just some work.

02:14.369 --> 02:15.470
I have to go.

02:17.071 --> 02:19.106
No, no, you're not getting
out of here that easily.

02:20.508 --> 02:24.479
Okay, we're going, just
tell her, get it over with.

02:24.512 --> 02:25.946
She's gonna to hate me.

02:27.047 --> 02:27.981
No. You'll be fine.

02:30.352 --> 02:31.185
I should eat.

02:34.922 --> 02:37.991
Hey he hey, what
are you doing?

02:38.025 --> 02:39.193
We're going for lunch.

02:39.227 --> 02:42.162
But your brother doesn't have
lunch till about five p.m..

02:42.196 --> 02:43.398
He's not my brother.

02:43.431 --> 02:44.432
Oh, "he's not my brother."

02:44.466 --> 02:46.066
We're not even related.

02:46.100 --> 02:46.967
Yeah, still.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.035
Fill up while we can.

02:51.673 --> 02:52.507
Still worrying?

02:53.441 --> 02:54.476
Hmm?

02:54.509 --> 02:55.510
It's gonna be okay.

03:06.688 --> 03:08.656
My brother made me a quiche.

03:10.492 --> 03:11.925
Well, that's all
vegetarians eat anyways, love.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.294
Yeah, every week.

03:13.328 --> 03:15.663
- Just quiche.
- Only quiche.

04:42.517 --> 04:45.118
Well, go on, then.

04:45.152 --> 04:45.986
Play something.

04:54.229 --> 04:55.563
I need to pee.

05:26.294 --> 05:27.194
It's not ready.

05:28.630 --> 05:30.298
We don't have lunch
till three on Sundays.

05:30.331 --> 05:32.667
Yeah, I remember.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.067
If you're hungry, I
can make you something.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.203
No, no, I'm fine.

05:36.571 --> 05:37.372
Hi.

05:37.405 --> 05:38.606
Sorry.

05:38.640 --> 05:39.474
Hello.

05:41.276 --> 05:42.710
How are you?

05:42.744 --> 05:43.811
Good, good.

05:43.845 --> 05:44.679
How are you?

05:44.712 --> 05:46.414
I made you a quiche.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.449
Thank you. Delicious.

05:48.483 --> 05:49.317
Hey babe.

05:50.385 --> 05:52.420
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

05:52.453 --> 05:53.288
Mm-hmm.

05:55.223 --> 05:56.056
She's waiting.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.129
Have you seen the
state of the grass?

06:02.162 --> 06:03.431
You know, I'm just glad
your father isn't here

06:03.464 --> 06:05.132
to see what I've
been reduced to.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.402
You got Thomas.

06:07.435 --> 06:10.638
Oh yes, I have, but
he can't do everything.

06:10.672 --> 06:11.706
Grab us more lip.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.073
Any more for anymore?

06:18.546 --> 06:21.516
Charlotte passed her driving
test on Friday, didn't you?

06:21.549 --> 06:22.350
Oh, good.

06:22.383 --> 06:23.384
Well, that's useful.

06:24.352 --> 06:25.185
Thank you.

06:29.290 --> 06:30.123
Mum.

06:34.696 --> 06:36.297
We've decided that we're moving.

06:38.232 --> 06:39.334
Well, that is good.

06:41.703 --> 06:43.871
You know, I think
the Hendersons' place

06:43.905 --> 06:45.206
is becoming available.

06:45.840 --> 06:46.808
No, no.

06:51.245 --> 06:52.380
We're moving to Australia.

06:55.783 --> 06:56.618
Excuse me?

06:57.585 --> 06:58.419
Australia.

07:00.321 --> 07:03.324
We've been thinking about
it for a while and it's...

07:03.358 --> 07:04.191
Kind of...

07:05.259 --> 07:06.260
Just makes sense.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.766
What about your
responsibilities?

07:11.799 --> 07:14.302
What responsibilities, Mum?

07:14.335 --> 07:15.837
This house.

07:15.870 --> 07:17.170
Your family.

07:18.306 --> 07:19.440
Nine generations.

07:22.510 --> 07:23.344
Here we are.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.583
Your brother is leaving me.

07:28.616 --> 07:31.452
He's not my brother, and
I'm not leaving you, Mum.

07:31.486 --> 07:33.621
We're moving to Australia.

07:33.655 --> 07:35.590
Well, I don't feel
really well, you know.

07:35.623 --> 07:36.557
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to go lie down.

07:36.591 --> 07:38.292
- It's my hip.
- Hip.

07:38.326 --> 07:40.193
- Will you bring my food up?
- Mum.

07:40.228 --> 07:43.331
Yes, and I'll bring your
hot water bottle, don't worry.

07:43.364 --> 07:45.600
No, we will discuss
it, just the two of us.

07:46.668 --> 07:47.502
My glasses.

07:48.703 --> 07:49.537
Thank you.

07:54.542 --> 07:55.643
Lunch is almost ready.

07:55.677 --> 07:56.678
We're not staying.

08:11.325 --> 08:12.160
When you're
finished clocking out,

08:12.192 --> 08:14.662
can you give me a
hand moving Stanley?

08:14.696 --> 08:16.330
Door's loose on his stable.

08:22.336 --> 08:25.440
Oh, man, you know I have
to start riding lessons?

08:25.473 --> 08:27.341
Open this place up to
schools or something.

08:27.375 --> 08:29.343
But you hate kids.

08:29.377 --> 08:30.578
Aye, I do hate kids.

08:33.781 --> 08:34.982
You all right?

08:35.016 --> 08:37.552
Yeah, I just feel
a bit dizzy today.

08:38.853 --> 08:40.755
Okay. Well, do you
want to sit down?

08:45.493 --> 08:46.728
Whoa, are you all right?

08:46.761 --> 08:47.995
I am so sorry.

08:48.029 --> 08:50.264
Don't be sorry, it's fine.

08:50.298 --> 08:51.466
I think we should take
you to the medical center.

08:51.499 --> 08:53.868
- No, I don't like doctors.
- I'm not asking, we're going.

09:02.977 --> 09:04.412
Charlotte Wilde?

09:04.445 --> 09:06.247
Dr. Richards is ready for you.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.453
This has been going
on for how long?

09:13.988 --> 09:16.557
A week or two, maybe three.

09:18.459 --> 09:22.964
You live with Ben
Clayton up by Horn Lane?

09:22.997 --> 09:24.365
Yeah, a year and a half.

09:24.398 --> 09:25.633
Not married.

09:25.666 --> 09:26.901
Nope.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.970
Your last period,
how long ago was it?

09:30.471 --> 09:32.707
I'm not sure, it
can be irregular.

09:32.740 --> 09:35.777
- More than six weeks?
- Maybe.

09:35.810 --> 09:37.044
I mean, I don't remember.

09:37.078 --> 09:39.413
Well, we should,
please, sit down.

09:41.516 --> 09:43.551
We should do a blood
test to be sure,

09:43.584 --> 09:45.686
but I'm quite certain
you're pregnant.

09:45.720 --> 09:46.754
Congratulations.

09:48.756 --> 09:51.859
But I can't be
because I'm on the pill.

09:51.893 --> 09:54.962
No form of birth
control is 100% effective.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.032
I need to get you booked
in with a stenographer,

09:58.065 --> 10:00.301
they come to the
hospital every Thursday.

10:01.903 --> 10:04.539
Don't seem to have any
of your medical records.

10:04.572 --> 10:06.607
Any family history
I should know about,

10:06.641 --> 10:08.009
preexisting conditions?

10:09.477 --> 10:10.778
What if I don't want it?

10:12.413 --> 10:13.881
The baby, what if I don't
want to go through with it?

10:13.915 --> 10:15.416
What are you suggesting?

10:18.119 --> 10:20.922
It's a shock, I just want
to know what my options are.

10:22.757 --> 10:26.527
I think your best option
would be to go home,

10:26.561 --> 10:30.565
discuss this with Ben, and
not make any rash decisions.

10:44.579 --> 10:49.550
Thanks.

11:25.152 --> 11:27.455
Hey hey hey, I'll get that.

11:27.488 --> 11:28.956
I'll get that, you
shouldn't be lifting.

11:28.990 --> 11:30.191
Oh my god.

11:30.225 --> 11:31.726
How the hell do you know?

11:31.759 --> 11:32.693
- Doesn't matter.
- Ben.

11:32.727 --> 11:33.694
Mum told me.

11:33.728 --> 11:35.429
- What?!
- Dr. Richards told Mum.

11:35.463 --> 11:36.331
He's been our doctor for ages.
You are, you are, aren't you?

11:36.365 --> 11:38.466
I could have him
struck off for that.

11:38.499 --> 11:39.600
Come on, I know it's
not news you wanted,

11:39.634 --> 11:41.535
but it is such good news!

11:41.569 --> 11:43.104
- No, is it?
- Yes!

11:43.137 --> 11:44.639
We're meant to be going away.

11:44.672 --> 11:46.173
How are we gonna do that?

11:46.208 --> 11:47.975
We'll go as a family.

11:48.009 --> 11:49.510
You, me, and the baby.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.545
No, no no no, no, I'm
on the pill for a reason?

11:53.681 --> 11:54.749
You're not your mum.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.184
Fuck off.

11:57.219 --> 11:58.653
And that's what
you're worried about.

11:58.686 --> 11:59.887
You're not your mum, you're
gonna be a great mum.

11:59.921 --> 12:01.122
You're gonna be a
great mum, all right?

12:02.590 --> 12:03.491
Promise you.

12:03.524 --> 12:05.192
And I'm gonna be an
amazing dad, obviously.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.528
You don't get it.

12:10.197 --> 12:13.567
Go away, leave me
alone, leave me alone.

12:13.601 --> 12:15.536
I'll put these in water.

12:21.676 --> 12:23.844
Congratulations are in order.

12:23.878 --> 12:27.081
This is very exciting.

12:27.114 --> 12:27.915
Thank you.

12:29.684 --> 12:32.553
So we're going to
have to act quickly

12:33.921 --> 12:37.591
before she starts to
show, prepare everything.

12:37.625 --> 12:39.193
- Prepare what?
- For the wedding.

12:40.594 --> 12:41.495
Oh, Mum.

12:41.529 --> 12:42.863
I thought we'd have a marquis.

12:43.731 --> 12:45.032
We don't need one.

12:46.667 --> 12:48.035
But we can't have that
many people in the house.

12:48.069 --> 12:51.505
- No, we don't need a wedding.
- Of course you do.

12:51.539 --> 12:52.707
No we don't.

12:52.740 --> 12:54.575
What will people say?

12:54.608 --> 12:55.643
Well, they can
say what they like.

12:55.676 --> 12:57.279
We're not gonna be here long.

12:57.312 --> 12:59.480
You're not still
planning that nonsense.

13:01.682 --> 13:03.050
You're not taking my grandchild.

13:03.084 --> 13:04.819
I'm sorry, Mum.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.654
We have to do
what's right for us.

13:06.687 --> 13:09.257
You're not stealing
my own flesh and blood

13:09.291 --> 13:10.658
to the other side of the planet.

13:10.691 --> 13:11.859
We need a fresh start.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.661
It's easy for you,
you have no one.

13:13.694 --> 13:16.063
Coming back here, Mum,
it was only ever temporary.

13:16.097 --> 13:17.898
I can't stay here.

13:17.932 --> 13:19.133
- You don't mean that.
- I do mean it.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.602
I do mean it, and stop
telling me what I want!

13:24.572 --> 13:27.675
You cannot walk
out on this place!

13:28.709 --> 13:29.810
I've got to go work.

13:37.319 --> 13:40.688
It's not gonna be
that bad, Mum, okay?

13:41.622 --> 13:43.891
We'll fly you out to
Australia, we can fly back,

13:43.924 --> 13:45.293
we can come for Christmas.

13:46.794 --> 13:47.628
Please.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.234
We can Skype.

14:08.316 --> 14:09.750
Look, I'll call you later, okay?

14:09.784 --> 14:11.719
We can talk about it.

14:15.223 --> 14:16.057
Mum.

14:30.372 --> 14:32.207
Look, I know that
was hard for you.

14:33.275 --> 14:34.141
I'm proud of you.

14:37.745 --> 14:38.612
Yeah?

14:38.646 --> 14:39.580
You did it.

14:41.316 --> 14:42.317
We are going to Australia.

14:42.350 --> 14:43.784
We're going to Australia.

14:43.818 --> 14:44.718
We're going to Australia.

14:44.752 --> 14:45.753
We're going to Australia.

14:48.956 --> 14:51.293
Jesus fucking Christ.

14:55.297 --> 14:56.398
What is it?

14:56.431 --> 14:57.631
Congratulations.

14:58.400 --> 14:59.234
Thank you.

15:05.139 --> 15:06.674
See, he's okay.

15:08.709 --> 15:09.743
No he's not.

15:19.720 --> 15:20.754
Whoa, dude!

15:25.693 --> 15:28.430
Shh, don't say anything.

15:28.463 --> 15:29.297
Oh, god.

15:31.132 --> 15:34.735
Okay. Do you want
to talk about it?

15:34.768 --> 15:36.003
I don't want it.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.805
I don't want the baby.

15:37.838 --> 15:40.808
I mean this whole something
using my body as a host

15:40.841 --> 15:42.810
and then getting bigger
and bigger and bigger

15:42.843 --> 15:45.846
and then coming out of
a hole that is that big.

15:45.880 --> 15:47.014
It's , to be fair.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.983
Oh, I don't want to be a mum.

15:49.016 --> 15:50.684
I don't want to be
stuck being a mum,

15:50.718 --> 15:52.853
and I don't even know what
being a mum looks like.

15:54.322 --> 15:55.189
Exhausted.

15:56.358 --> 15:57.725
You already live like
that, so it's fine.

15:57.758 --> 15:59.727
Shut up, I'm serious.

15:59.760 --> 16:00.661
Look, you'd be great.

16:02.096 --> 16:04.932
And I mean, at least you'll
be making Margaret happy.

16:04.965 --> 16:06.234
Oh, fucking Margaret.

16:09.371 --> 16:10.704
And Thomas.

16:11.506 --> 16:13.040
I mean, why is he even there?

16:13.073 --> 16:14.875
I don't know.

16:14.909 --> 16:16.244
They're not even related.

16:16.278 --> 16:17.111
He just...

16:18.746 --> 16:20.348
Ben reckons he's trying to
worm his way into the will.

16:20.382 --> 16:22.450
Ah, probably wants the house.

16:22.484 --> 16:23.817
Yeah, he can have it.

16:28.490 --> 16:29.757
This is shit.

16:30.758 --> 16:32.126
You're getting rid of it?

16:37.232 --> 16:38.065
Ooh.

16:39.800 --> 16:42.136
- Oh.
- Speak of the devil.

16:49.411 --> 16:50.811
Sorry.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.713
What time do you
call this, then?

16:54.249 --> 16:55.350
It's been a mad day.

16:58.253 --> 17:00.020
Why people think pigs are pets.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.325
- How you doing?
- Hi baby.

17:10.931 --> 17:11.932
What we got?

17:17.339 --> 17:18.939
Bonnie.

17:18.973 --> 17:20.208
Hey.

17:20.242 --> 17:21.809
Hey.

17:21.842 --> 17:22.876
Hey, you.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.280
Is there anything I should know?

17:25.313 --> 17:26.481
She's just not been
herself, to be honest.

17:26.514 --> 17:28.048
You know, she's
normally so lively.

17:28.983 --> 17:30.418
Anyway, I'll be back
with your tea in a sec.

17:30.452 --> 17:33.087
- See what you think.
- All right, cheers.

17:34.021 --> 17:35.856
Bonnie. You all right?

17:37.559 --> 17:38.393
All right?

17:52.072 --> 17:53.241
Ben?

17:53.275 --> 17:54.442
Charlotte!

17:56.211 --> 17:57.111
Jane?

17:57.144 --> 17:58.045
Charlotte, someone help!

17:58.078 --> 17:59.146
- What happened?
- Charlotte.

17:59.179 --> 18:00.948
She's kicked him.

18:00.981 --> 18:02.450
Ben, Ben, can you hear me?

18:02.484 --> 18:03.285
Can you hear me?

18:03.318 --> 18:04.452
Ben, can you hear me?

18:04.486 --> 18:05.387
Ben.

18:05.420 --> 18:07.489
Ben, you're gonna be all right.

18:07.522 --> 18:08.356
It's Jane.

18:09.557 --> 18:11.191
Ben, it's gonna be okay,
we're gonna get you,

18:11.226 --> 18:12.860
Charlotte, come
help me lift him.

18:12.893 --> 18:14.262
I think we should all someone.

18:14.296 --> 18:15.896
Charlotte.

18:15.929 --> 18:16.964
No, there's no time for
that, will you grab his legs?

18:16.997 --> 18:18.600
We need to get him outside.

18:18.633 --> 18:19.567
Ben.

18:19.601 --> 18:21.369
You're gonna be all right.

18:21.403 --> 18:22.437
It's Jane.

18:22.470 --> 18:23.937
You're gonna be okay.

18:23.971 --> 18:24.805
Let's lift.

18:27.941 --> 18:32.946
We're taking you there now.

18:36.050 --> 18:39.254
Grab that, put pressure
on the wound, okay?

18:39.287 --> 18:40.455
Okay.

18:40.488 --> 18:41.556
Just keep
talking to him, okay?

18:41.589 --> 18:43.924
- Stay with me, please.
- It's gonna be all right.

18:43.957 --> 18:46.894
Stay with me, okay?

18:46.927 --> 18:50.532
Going to be all right,
just stay with me.

18:56.604 --> 19:00.308
It's gonna be
okay, Char, all right?

19:54.396 --> 19:55.397
Charlotte.

19:58.966 --> 20:00.368
I'm sorry.

20:00.402 --> 20:01.969
We did everything we could.

20:02.737 --> 20:04.539
The damage was just too great.

20:08.343 --> 20:10.077
What have you done?

20:10.110 --> 20:11.446
- I'm sorry?
- Not you, her.

20:16.718 --> 20:21.356
This is all your fault.

20:27.729 --> 20:29.497
Charlotte!

20:29.531 --> 20:30.931
Get her off me!

20:39.340 --> 20:41.008
- My son.
- My god.

20:41.676 --> 20:43.010
It's my son.

20:44.612 --> 20:45.979
Oh, my son.

20:46.013 --> 20:47.014
My son, my son.

21:56.149 --> 21:56.751
Hey.

21:59.420 --> 22:00.187
How you feeling?

22:01.656 --> 22:03.056
Here, have some of this.

22:09.264 --> 22:12.065
Been in bed for the past few
days, you must be exhausted.

22:16.471 --> 22:18.206
You remember what happened?

22:21.141 --> 22:23.043
The funeral's tomorrow.

22:28.383 --> 22:30.117
Okay, well I need to see him.

22:31.619 --> 22:32.420
No you don't.

22:34.422 --> 22:35.256
I wish I hadn't.

22:40.895 --> 22:46.099
There are some things in
life it's better not to see.

22:59.647 --> 23:03.551
I think we've all behaved
in ways that we regret.

23:09.290 --> 23:10.190
How are you feeling?

23:10.224 --> 23:11.191
How is the baby?

23:13.761 --> 23:15.296
I should go home.

23:15.330 --> 23:16.331
No, rest.

23:16.364 --> 23:17.832
It's the doctor's orders.

23:21.235 --> 23:23.103
Need to start thinking
about the baby.

23:24.238 --> 23:27.609
Just stay here with
us for a while.

23:27.642 --> 23:29.777
We'll look after you, we
have everything you need.

23:33.180 --> 23:34.882
It's a bit cold in here.

23:34.916 --> 23:37.752
Thomas, get her a heater,
I don't want her to get sick.

23:38.953 --> 23:43.156
Just try and get some rest,
and we will serve lunch at one.

24:52.593 --> 24:54.562
Where did you get that?

24:54.595 --> 24:55.596
In Ben's room.

24:56.597 --> 24:58.900
Would you take it off, please?

24:58.933 --> 25:00.768
- I was cold, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

25:05.406 --> 25:06.808
I'll get you something else.

25:12.847 --> 25:14.982
Come in, my dear, how are you?

25:15.950 --> 25:17.518
Come and have something to eat.

25:18.920 --> 25:20.388
Sorry, I was very hungry.

25:29.797 --> 25:31.799
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

25:45.480 --> 25:47.582
Well, I think it's
important that we all

25:49.617 --> 25:50.685
keep our strength up.

25:56.491 --> 25:58.626
Oh, goodness, Thomas.

25:58.659 --> 25:59.861
Oh.

25:59.894 --> 26:02.296
I'm so sorry,
my dear, so sorry.

26:04.465 --> 26:06.033
Honestly, no, it's fine.

26:07.001 --> 26:08.269
I'm not even that hungry.

26:09.337 --> 26:11.339
- Oh.
- Excuse the fingers.

26:11.372 --> 26:12.207
It's fine.

26:12.241 --> 26:13.608
Have a little bit
of salt and pepper.

26:16.711 --> 26:20.648
I think we need to
find something suitable

26:22.750 --> 26:24.452
for you to wear at the funeral.

26:26.420 --> 26:27.455
Where is it?

26:29.357 --> 26:31.392
It's going to be here.

26:33.795 --> 26:35.530
On the grounds,
we're going to...

26:38.833 --> 26:41.869
Lay Ben to rest just
takes to his father.

26:41.903 --> 26:43.805
I think that's what
he would have wanted.

26:46.874 --> 26:48.509
I'm gonna need to go home.

26:48.543 --> 26:50.378
I need some of my things.

26:50.411 --> 26:52.613
Well, I sent Thomas
over yesterday.

26:54.015 --> 26:55.817
He collected some
of your things.

26:55.850 --> 26:58.920
I think everything you want
would be in your wardrobe.

27:00.121 --> 27:02.456
Do you know where my phone is?

27:02.490 --> 27:03.324
Yes.

27:06.861 --> 27:08.095
Thanks.

27:08.129 --> 27:09.463
It must've
broken when you fell.

27:11.065 --> 27:13.367
But I can get it fixed for
you when I'm next in town.

27:14.468 --> 27:15.670
Yeah.

27:15.703 --> 27:17.438
Yeah, do you mind,
is that all right?

27:17.471 --> 27:20.741
- Of course.
- Thank you, appreciate it.

27:56.010 --> 27:57.078
Gee, I thought
there'd be more people.

27:57.111 --> 28:00.481
It's so remote here, and
Margaret said she wanted

28:00.514 --> 28:02.416
a small family thing.

28:02.450 --> 28:03.951
What about what you wanted?

28:03.985 --> 28:05.653
It doesn't matter.

28:06.520 --> 28:08.122
You okay?

28:08.155 --> 28:09.724
No, I've been feeling dizzy.

28:11.158 --> 28:12.460
Well, it's understandable.

28:15.496 --> 28:16.831
Hello, Jane.

28:16.864 --> 28:17.698
I'm so sorry.

28:18.799 --> 28:20.201
How are you feeling?

28:20.235 --> 28:21.602
Would you like to have a rest?

28:21.636 --> 28:22.470
I'm fine.

28:24.171 --> 28:25.274
There's going to
be some refreshments

28:25.307 --> 28:27.975
headed around shortly, so
make sure you eat something.

28:30.645 --> 28:31.779
I swear, this grass.

28:33.047 --> 28:34.582
It's a disgrace.

28:35.516 --> 28:37.685
- Should we head in?
- Hmm.

28:42.556 --> 28:45.526
Listen, I can't stay, I've
got to get back to work.

28:45.559 --> 28:47.128
- But will you be all right?
- Yeah.

28:47.161 --> 28:48.062
Sure?

30:14.015 --> 30:16.550
Can play something
else, if you prefer.

30:16.584 --> 30:17.985
No.

30:18.019 --> 30:19.887
Don't really get a
chance to play that often.

30:21.722 --> 30:23.958
I'm trying to convince Margaret
to learn a song with me.

30:23.991 --> 30:25.760
She's got such an amazing voice.

30:27.362 --> 30:28.195
But she won't.

30:29.130 --> 30:29.964
It's a waste.

30:33.934 --> 30:35.169
You play, don't you?

30:37.305 --> 30:38.240
I used to.

30:42.344 --> 30:43.311
Oh, whoop.

30:45.179 --> 30:46.580
- Sorry.
- Okay?

30:46.614 --> 30:48.582
Yeah, fine, I just
get a bit dizzy.

30:48.616 --> 30:50.117
- Sorry.
- Okay.

30:50.151 --> 30:50.951
Sit down.

30:56.358 --> 30:57.158
Ooh.

31:02.963 --> 31:04.131
I'll get you some water.

31:04.165 --> 31:06.867
No, I'm fine,
I'm okay, honestly.

31:56.717 --> 31:57.352
It's not fair.

31:58.719 --> 32:00.654
Sorry, I don't
mean to disturb you.

32:00.688 --> 32:04.226
Oh, been too much
death in this family.

32:08.396 --> 32:09.231
Poor Ben.

32:11.098 --> 32:13.734
His father William,
he died of cancer.

32:15.102 --> 32:17.972
And I miss him every single day.

32:20.408 --> 32:25.413
He was the most wonderful
father, and Ben just adored him.

32:29.717 --> 32:31.185
And Thomas's dad?

32:35.823 --> 32:36.991
That was a farming accident.

32:37.024 --> 32:39.093
I just should never married him,

32:39.126 --> 32:40.794
that was the biggest
mistake of my life.

32:40.828 --> 32:41.829
Come.

32:45.866 --> 32:46.700
Oh.

32:49.304 --> 32:51.071
I think it's gonna be a boy.

32:53.241 --> 32:55.743
I really hope so.

32:57.111 --> 32:58.846
Some women flourish
when they're pregnant,

32:58.879 --> 33:00.348
it certainly seems to suit you.

33:01.449 --> 33:04.852
It won't be long now before you
start feeling some movement.

33:05.753 --> 33:07.422
I'm looking for my shoes.

33:08.356 --> 33:11.259
I was thinking of taking
walk to the grave.

33:11.293 --> 33:14.128
Thomas said that you
were dizzy last night.

33:14.161 --> 33:15.963
Yeah, but I think
some fresh air

33:15.996 --> 33:17.232
might do me some good, no?

33:17.265 --> 33:19.467
Yes, well maybe later,
but it's a bit cold now,

33:19.501 --> 33:20.901
you've got to think
about the baby.

33:20.935 --> 33:22.069
It's all I think about.

33:23.037 --> 33:25.373
You just follow what
Dr. Richards' orders are

33:25.407 --> 33:27.741
and that baby will be just fine,

33:27.775 --> 33:30.378
and that means you resting
and not rushing out

33:30.412 --> 33:31.779
into the freezing cold.

33:31.812 --> 33:33.381
I think I'm ready
to go home now.

33:36.518 --> 33:41.722
Oh, well look, we
have your things here.

33:42.257 --> 33:43.425
Come, I'll show you.

33:47.828 --> 33:50.030
You know, he was never
very good with money.

33:51.198 --> 33:53.934
Just like his father,
would seem that Ben

33:53.968 --> 33:56.238
had more than a few
financial problems.

33:57.405 --> 33:59.073
When the bank found
out he was dead,

33:59.106 --> 34:00.941
they foreclosed on the cottage.

34:00.975 --> 34:01.809
What?

34:03.278 --> 34:04.878
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

34:04.912 --> 34:06.814
I know you may have
some reservations,

34:06.847 --> 34:07.881
but you can stay here.

34:07.915 --> 34:09.817
I think is the
best place for you.

34:11.353 --> 34:14.054
But he didn't
mention anything.

34:15.990 --> 34:18.226
- My house.
- Ben's house.

34:20.395 --> 34:22.096
You just have a rest and we can

34:23.063 --> 34:24.999
worry about the future later.

34:28.936 --> 34:30.904
I'm sorry, I had to
go through everything.

34:30.938 --> 34:35.210
I had to get the paperwork
for the inheritance tax.

34:35.243 --> 34:36.944
If there's anything
belonging to you,

34:36.977 --> 34:39.214
I'll make sure that
Thomas brings it up to you

34:39.247 --> 34:41.181
or puts it in the basement,
isn't that right, Thomas?

34:41.216 --> 34:42.049
Yeah.

34:45.185 --> 34:47.955
So you're telling me that
I no longer have a home.

34:48.956 --> 34:51.058
I know. Bit of a shock.

34:53.027 --> 34:55.896
But maybe for the best.

34:57.931 --> 34:58.999
Being part of the family.

35:04.872 --> 35:06.907
Sorry, is everybody
okay with quiche?

37:30.652 --> 37:31.486
Hey.

37:34.188 --> 37:35.356
What happened to my hand?

37:37.024 --> 37:39.159
You cut it on a glass last
night. Do you not remember?

37:41.195 --> 37:42.996
Maybe you should
just stay in bed.

37:43.030 --> 37:44.064
You've got a visitor downstairs,

37:44.097 --> 37:46.066
but I'll just send her away.

37:46.099 --> 37:47.034
What?

37:47.067 --> 37:47.702
Jane?

37:48.703 --> 37:49.671
Yeah.

37:49.704 --> 37:51.038
No, no, no, I'm coming.

37:52.540 --> 37:54.074
It's good to see you.

37:54.107 --> 37:55.276
So how you feeling?

37:56.377 --> 37:57.278
Stuck.

37:58.513 --> 38:00.013
- Still?
- Hmm.

38:00.047 --> 38:02.082
Well, I know that I
don't want to be here.

38:03.551 --> 38:05.118
Australia?

38:05.152 --> 38:05.986
Yeah, somehow.

38:07.655 --> 38:09.257
How is the yard?

38:09.290 --> 38:11.191
Oh, it's all good,
you know, same old.

38:11.226 --> 38:12.059
We miss you.

38:13.528 --> 38:16.264
So has everything been okay
with your scans and stuff?

38:16.297 --> 38:17.499
I've not had any yet.

38:17.532 --> 38:20.235
The doctor comes here,
he said I don't need to.

38:20.268 --> 38:21.101
What?

38:23.304 --> 38:25.406
Can I get you some tea?

38:25.440 --> 38:27.074
I'm okay, thank you.

38:28.209 --> 38:30.043
Maybe you should
see another doctor.

38:30.077 --> 38:31.446
- Well, yeah-
- Oh, don't worry.

38:31.479 --> 38:34.147
Dr. Richards has
everything under control.

38:34.181 --> 38:36.351
Does she not need
to go to hospital?

38:36.384 --> 38:38.051
He doesn't seem to
think it's necessary.

38:38.085 --> 38:40.221
We can take care of her here.

38:40.255 --> 38:41.088
Right.

38:42.155 --> 38:43.190
You okay?

38:44.191 --> 38:45.326
Yeah.

38:45.360 --> 38:46.828
Sorry.

38:46.861 --> 38:48.763
God, I just felt, I'm just
gonna go to the toilet.

38:48.796 --> 38:49.631
Give me a minute.

38:50.832 --> 38:52.199
Do you want me
to come with you?

38:52.233 --> 38:52.800
No no no, sit
down, I'll be back.

38:52.834 --> 38:53.535
Be back in a sec.

39:17.458 --> 39:18.293
Thomas.

39:19.794 --> 39:21.396
Where's Jane?

39:21.429 --> 39:23.431
She had to go,
something at work.

39:23.464 --> 39:25.266
She said she'd call you.

39:25.300 --> 39:27.635
What, she just
left, just like that?

39:27.669 --> 39:28.469
Hmm.

39:29.871 --> 39:31.606
Okay, so have
you fixed my phone?

39:32.674 --> 39:34.107
Should be ready Friday.

39:35.677 --> 39:37.144
I'm gonna start making lunch.

39:56.898 --> 39:57.699
Oh my god.

39:57.732 --> 39:59.267
Jeez.

39:59.300 --> 40:00.468
Thomas, what are you doing?

40:00.501 --> 40:01.302
What?

40:01.336 --> 40:02.503
Why are you in here?

40:02.537 --> 40:04.639
You were screaming
the night, so I came in.

40:06.207 --> 40:09.210
You wouldn't let me leave,
do you not remember?

40:09.243 --> 40:09.877
No.

40:11.946 --> 40:13.915
Well, can you get out, please?

40:13.948 --> 40:15.216
Okay, sorry.

40:15.249 --> 40:16.417
I didn't mean to scare you.

40:25.627 --> 40:28.496
I've ordered everything
for the nursery

40:28.529 --> 40:31.432
so we can start painting soon.

40:32.467 --> 40:34.201
- Nursery?
- Yeah, for the baby.

40:35.803 --> 40:37.538
We won't be
living here, Thomas.

40:38.806 --> 40:41.909
No, I know, I know,
it's for when you visit.

40:42.810 --> 40:43.611
Hopefully.

40:45.913 --> 40:46.714
Okay.

40:48.483 --> 40:49.250
Sorry.

41:27.622 --> 41:30.491
Hello Mr.
Magpie, how's your wife?

41:32.260 --> 41:34.194
It is bad luck
to see only one.

41:37.331 --> 41:39.901
Thomas tells me you were
feeling a bit sick yesterday.

41:39.934 --> 41:41.335
Bit nauseous?

41:41.369 --> 41:42.437
Hmm.

41:42.470 --> 41:44.706
I was the same as Benjamin.

41:44.739 --> 41:45.540
Just terrible.

41:46.574 --> 41:47.775
You have a drink of this.

41:48.876 --> 41:49.677
Thanks.

41:51.312 --> 41:52.980
Now, I'm just gonna
leave you to have a rest.

42:15.903 --> 42:17.305
Margaret!

42:20.475 --> 42:21.309
Margaret!

42:25.813 --> 42:30.818
Get your scrawny ass down
here and give me my money now!

42:37.425 --> 42:39.961
Just
calm down, George.

43:20.902 --> 43:23.371
I was
situation, I wasn't sure

43:23.404 --> 43:25.473
that you could manage
it on your own.

43:25.506 --> 43:27.074
I was managing.

43:27.108 --> 43:29.677
I don't understand why
you insist on.

43:29.710 --> 43:31.979
How the hell would he get
here all the way to the house?

43:32.013 --> 43:33.948
I don't know, he must've just
cut the chain or something.

43:33.981 --> 43:35.383
I was terrified.

43:35.416 --> 43:36.784
Right, well, he's
gone now, he's all gone.

43:38.152 --> 43:39.987
Anything could have happened.

43:40.021 --> 43:41.522
Look, look, I'll
go down to the gate

43:41.556 --> 43:43.090
and I will make
sure it's locked.

43:43.124 --> 43:45.092
But just calm down.

43:45.126 --> 43:45.960
Okay?

44:24.198 --> 44:26.500
I want to go to
the hospital today.

44:26.534 --> 44:27.969
Now, I want a scan.

44:28.002 --> 44:29.070
They have someone
there on Thursdays.

44:29.103 --> 44:31.806
Well you can't, I have
an appointment elsewhere.

44:31.839 --> 44:35.076
Well, I'm going, with
or without your help.

44:35.109 --> 44:37.411
Don't be ridiculous, how
are you gonna get there?

44:37.445 --> 44:38.479
I'll walk if I have to.

44:43.651 --> 44:45.453
Okay.

44:45.486 --> 44:46.454
Okay!

44:47.889 --> 44:48.923
Thomas will take you.

44:57.865 --> 45:00.067
- Charlotte Wilde.
- Yep, that's me.

45:06.040 --> 45:07.975
No no, I can go alone.

45:08.009 --> 45:10.578
- Is this dad?
- No, no, he's-

45:10.611 --> 45:12.647
- A friend.
- Okay, follow me.

45:15.983 --> 45:16.817
Okay.

45:19.620 --> 45:22.224
So you're 20 weeks, but
this is your first scan?

45:22.257 --> 45:23.090
Yup.

45:24.125 --> 45:24.959
Okay.

45:26.160 --> 45:27.461
So...

45:28.796 --> 45:30.498
There we are.

45:30.531 --> 45:31.165
Can you see it?

45:32.633 --> 45:33.901
Oh my god.

45:37.004 --> 45:40.007
Bear with me, I'm just
gonna take a few measurements.

45:40.041 --> 45:41.075
I'm just looking at
the blood flowing

45:41.108 --> 45:43.044
in and out of the heart.

45:43.077 --> 45:44.512
It all looks okay?

45:44.545 --> 45:46.480
Yes, so far
everything looks fine.

45:48.115 --> 45:49.517
Do you want to know the sex?

45:50.685 --> 45:51.519
It's a boy.

45:53.020 --> 45:53.888
That's right.

46:07.568 --> 46:09.271
So are you planning on
having the baby here?

46:09.304 --> 46:11.505
There's a few great
birthing rooms upstairs.

46:14.041 --> 46:15.277
I dunno.

46:15.310 --> 46:17.212
I haven't thought about it.

46:17.245 --> 46:18.112
Yeah, I guess so.

46:20.081 --> 46:22.616
I can organize for you
to come in and take a look.

46:23.617 --> 46:24.652
You okay?

46:25.886 --> 46:26.988
I've been feeling dizzy.

46:27.021 --> 46:28.689
Well, that's normal.

46:30.292 --> 46:33.661
I've been having these
weird dreams as well.

46:33.694 --> 46:36.897
When I was pregnant, I
kept dreaming about clowns.

46:36.931 --> 46:37.965
It was terrible.

46:37.999 --> 46:38.833
What are yours?

46:40.701 --> 46:43.070
Birds, crows and stuff.

46:43.104 --> 46:44.605
It's better than clowns.

46:46.173 --> 46:47.275
So it's normal.

46:47.309 --> 46:49.010
Completely.
It's hormones.

46:49.043 --> 46:50.044
See, there you go.

46:51.746 --> 46:53.614
Is there
anything else on your mind?

46:55.283 --> 46:57.551
I'm feeling a little thirsty.

46:57.585 --> 46:59.987
Thomas, can you go
get me some water?

47:00.021 --> 47:01.223
Oh, there's
a water fountain

47:01.256 --> 47:02.623
at the end of the hall.

47:03.891 --> 47:05.626
- Thanks.
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

47:20.174 --> 47:21.175
Can I still fly?

47:22.344 --> 47:23.744
Fly?

47:23.778 --> 47:25.146
I was thinking
about going away.

47:28.616 --> 47:30.651
I mean, yeah, I
don't see why not.

47:30.684 --> 47:32.720
Usually up to seven months,
although I'm not sure

47:32.753 --> 47:33.988
I'd advise it.

47:34.021 --> 47:35.357
You off on holiday?

47:35.390 --> 47:36.190
I'm not sure.

47:40.828 --> 47:41.962
Is everything okay?

47:44.799 --> 47:46.100
Do you want to talk to somebody?

47:49.737 --> 47:52.673
Look, I know this
is gonna sound crazy,

47:52.706 --> 47:54.675
but they won't let
me go anywhere.

47:54.708 --> 47:55.743
Who?

47:57.745 --> 47:59.713
The family that
I'm staying with.

48:00.815 --> 48:01.582
I think they broke my phone.

48:01.615 --> 48:04.151
And they put
something in my tea.

48:04.185 --> 48:05.953
What do
you mean by something?

48:05.986 --> 48:07.855
Some kind of tablet.

48:07.888 --> 48:10.225
I'm confused all the
time, not just dizzy.

48:13.060 --> 48:14.862
I think they're
giving me something.

48:15.996 --> 48:18.999
Look, I think I'm
gonna need your help.

48:27.007 --> 48:28.109
Okay, wait here.

48:28.142 --> 48:28.976
Thank you.

48:41.922 --> 48:43.691
Where's she gone?

48:43.724 --> 48:46.127
She said she needed
to get someone.

48:46.160 --> 48:47.661
Who?

48:47.695 --> 48:48.330
Dunno.

48:53.401 --> 48:55.736
- What is he doing here?
- He's your doctor.

48:55.769 --> 48:57.905
No, no, no, he's
not my doctor.

48:57.938 --> 49:00.674
Listen to me, listen to me.

49:00.708 --> 49:02.009
What you're experiencing.

49:03.378 --> 49:06.046
Paranoia, anger, resentment,
and during pregnancy,

49:06.080 --> 49:06.981
your hormones are all...

49:07.014 --> 49:08.416
No no, I'm not paranoid.

49:08.450 --> 49:10.318
They won't let me out the house.

49:10.352 --> 49:11.752
He took my phone.

49:11.785 --> 49:12.987
Maybe they're a
tad overzealous,

49:13.020 --> 49:14.989
but it's your health and
the health of the baby

49:15.022 --> 49:16.824
they have in mind.

49:16.857 --> 49:19.093
Baby's the most
important thing, no?

49:19.126 --> 49:21.762
I'm sure we can
all agree on that.

49:21.795 --> 49:22.930
Charlotte?

49:22.963 --> 49:24.131
Yeah, I'm trying-

49:24.165 --> 49:25.733
- If you keep this
frenzy up, I mean it,

49:25.766 --> 49:26.700
you will lose the baby.

49:27.868 --> 49:29.737
Ben's baby, I'm
not exaggerating.

49:31.306 --> 49:34.276
For the baby's sake, for
your sake, try to stay calm.

49:35.809 --> 49:36.710
Do you understand?

49:38.480 --> 49:41.849
Go home, go to bed, read a book.

49:43.751 --> 49:44.818
Relax.

49:44.852 --> 49:45.686
Okay?

49:49.190 --> 49:50.824
Thank you, Dr. Richards.

49:57.499 --> 49:59.867
Look, I don't know what
you think is going on.

49:59.900 --> 50:02.770
All we want is to keep you
safe, keep the baby safe.

50:02.803 --> 50:04.104
Really?

50:04.138 --> 50:05.207
- Yes.
- You sure about that?

50:05.240 --> 50:06.073
Yes.

50:07.509 --> 50:10.478
That baby is everything to
Margaret, and to me too.

50:10.512 --> 50:12.480
Why do you keep me
shut in the house?

50:13.881 --> 50:15.983
We don't keep you
trapped in there.

50:16.016 --> 50:18.486
Dr. Richards said
total bedrest, okay?

50:18.520 --> 50:20.322
So all we're doing is
what he told us to do.

50:20.355 --> 50:22.923
Charlotte, you are
pregnant, it's safety first.

50:22.957 --> 50:24.426
I can't wait to
leave this place.

50:27.861 --> 50:29.331
I know you broke my phone.

50:30.831 --> 50:33.067
- I didn't break your phone.
- I know you did.

50:33.100 --> 50:35.237
I told you they can't
fix it, it's dead.

50:36.438 --> 50:38.240
Did you
put something in my tea?

50:38.273 --> 50:41.543
Do you really think we
would do something like that?

50:41.576 --> 50:43.445
I can't believe you
think we would do that.

50:43.478 --> 50:44.379
That's crazy.

50:45.913 --> 50:47.549
Look, we can give you
somewhere safe to stay

50:47.582 --> 50:49.850
until the baby's born.

50:49.883 --> 50:52.987
After that, if you want to
leave, no one's gonna stop you.

50:53.020 --> 50:56.056
But let us look after you.

50:56.090 --> 50:59.893
If not for you, for
Ben, for the baby.

51:01.329 --> 51:03.897
- You condition, Charlotte-
- I don't have a condition.

51:03.931 --> 51:05.799
That was my mum's thing.

51:05.833 --> 51:09.036
Yeah, my mum had a
condition, this is not that.

51:09.069 --> 51:09.903
Okay?

51:12.006 --> 51:13.807
Where else are you
going to go, Charlotte?

52:32.920 --> 52:34.289
Hello.

52:34.322 --> 52:35.122
Hey.

52:35.155 --> 52:36.123
Can I come in?

52:36.156 --> 52:37.191
Yeah, sure.

52:40.562 --> 52:42.530
I've just brought you a...

52:50.170 --> 52:51.138
Come sit down.

52:58.580 --> 53:00.382
Have you thought about names?

53:02.082 --> 53:03.117
Oh, not really.

53:04.619 --> 53:05.587
Maybe Benjamin?

53:06.588 --> 53:09.324
You're doing so well, I
think he'd be so proud.

53:11.091 --> 53:14.462
I just feel so big
and fat and tired.

53:14.496 --> 53:15.896
Yes, I know it's hard.

53:17.998 --> 53:18.932
You have to enjoy it.

53:20.635 --> 53:21.503
I didn't.

53:23.304 --> 53:25.939
The feeling of something
growing inside me.

53:29.577 --> 53:31.212
The aches and pains.

53:34.349 --> 53:38.986
For the last two months,
I was confined to bedrest.

53:39.019 --> 53:40.020
High blood pressure.

53:41.322 --> 53:43.658
It was this room,
I sat in that bed.

53:45.326 --> 53:51.031
Looking outside, watching
the birds and the trees

53:51.332 --> 53:53.668
and just waiting for it to end.

53:56.170 --> 53:57.205
I was never very broody.

54:00.375 --> 54:02.577
It was William who
wanted the child.

54:06.079 --> 54:07.549
And even when he was born,
it wasn't like people say,

54:07.582 --> 54:09.551
I didn't feel some
overwhelming rush of love.

54:09.584 --> 54:11.653
I just felt numb.

54:13.053 --> 54:14.087
Indifferent.

54:17.525 --> 54:24.532
This strange, vulnerable
thing sucking from me.

54:26.166 --> 54:27.435
Longing him for the day
that he'd stopped crying

54:27.469 --> 54:30.137
and would just sleep
through the night.

54:34.642 --> 54:36.009
You know he loved animals.

54:38.145 --> 54:39.012
He was always
chasing after them,

54:39.046 --> 54:40.648
whether they liked it or not.

54:42.182 --> 54:46.654
And one day when he was
about three or four,

54:46.688 --> 54:49.122
I think it must've been four.

54:49.156 --> 54:51.493
I don't know what age.

54:51.526 --> 54:54.127
But he was bitten
by our dog, Fraser.

54:55.062 --> 54:56.096
Was terrible.

54:57.799 --> 54:59.367
Blood.

54:59.400 --> 55:01.269
So we rushed him to
the car, screaming,

55:03.170 --> 55:06.541
and William driving like
a mad man to the doctor's,

55:06.574 --> 55:08.209
and I was in the back with him.

55:12.079 --> 55:14.047
And suddenly I had
this awful feeling.

55:17.552 --> 55:22.557
It was a feeling of
worry and sickness.

55:24.359 --> 55:26.159
Simply blind panic.

55:30.532 --> 55:32.667
It was then I realized
that I did love him.

55:38.105 --> 55:39.641
I loved him more than
I thought was possible,

55:39.674 --> 55:40.808
I loved him so much.

55:43.811 --> 55:44.812
My whole body ached.

55:45.847 --> 55:51.051
It wasn't a nice feeling,
but it was beautiful.

55:53.120 --> 55:58.125
And from that day on, I
dedicated myself to him.

56:06.133 --> 56:09.470
But I'd missed out
on those early years.

56:12.373 --> 56:13.408
I really envy you.

56:15.276 --> 56:18.111
I'd love to do it all
again, and really enjoy it.

56:19.247 --> 56:20.882
To not wish it away.

56:20.915 --> 56:25.219
To love every bad night's sleep.

56:27.221 --> 56:28.356
Just to do it properly.

56:31.693 --> 56:34.228
To love having a
baby in this house.

56:39.199 --> 56:40.668
What happened to the dog?

56:42.403 --> 56:43.204
Fraser?

56:46.574 --> 56:48.843
We had George shoot it.

56:51.212 --> 56:54.215
Ben was devastated, but
we couldn't keep it.

56:57.285 --> 56:58.786
We got rabbits instead.

57:08.296 --> 57:10.898
Right, you have to use
your imagination, okay?

57:10.932 --> 57:13.735
But I thought this would
be the perfect choice

57:13.768 --> 57:15.202
for the nursery.

57:15.236 --> 57:15.903
Look, look.

57:15.937 --> 57:16.771
Paint's arrived.

57:18.406 --> 57:21.476
Mint mocha is apparently
the most soothing color

57:21.509 --> 57:23.344
for newborns.

57:23.378 --> 57:24.879
Right?

57:24.912 --> 57:26.781
But I can do a little bit,
and if you don't like it,

57:26.814 --> 57:28.683
we can choose something else.

57:28.716 --> 57:33.186
Now, I thought the cot
would be perfect here,

57:33.221 --> 57:35.423
and that means we can
plug the baby monitor

57:35.456 --> 57:38.326
into the socket down
there, and it keeps it away

57:38.359 --> 57:41.229
from the radiator, because
that can get so hot.

57:41.262 --> 57:42.864
No one knows how to turn it off.

57:45.566 --> 57:47.468
Oh, that's just a bunch of stuff

57:47.502 --> 57:49.771
Margaret asked me to
bring up from the cellar.

57:49.804 --> 57:53.341
I think it's things that belonged
to Ben when he was a kid.

57:53.374 --> 57:54.208
Charlotte.

57:56.511 --> 57:57.345
Are we all right?

58:01.749 --> 58:03.284
I know you miss Ben.

58:03.317 --> 58:06.854
I know, and I can't
imagine how hard

58:06.888 --> 58:07.889
that's been for you.

58:09.023 --> 58:11.993
And I'm not trying
to do anything weird,

58:12.026 --> 58:14.295
like replace him or
anything like that.

58:14.328 --> 58:17.265
But I am here for you.

58:19.634 --> 58:20.468
And the baby.

58:21.369 --> 58:22.202
I'm here for you.

58:24.539 --> 58:26.708
I'm just gonna go to the loo.

58:26.741 --> 58:27.575
Okay.

59:42.984 --> 59:44.318
Oh.

59:44.352 --> 59:45.820
Margaret, the
doors are all locked.

59:45.853 --> 59:47.855
I want to go for a walk.

59:47.889 --> 59:48.723
I'm afraid not.

59:50.024 --> 59:51.392
What do you mean?

59:51.425 --> 59:52.927
You can't lock me inside.

59:52.960 --> 59:54.962
The baby is due any time now.

59:54.996 --> 59:56.697
It's time for you
to stay in bed.

59:56.731 --> 59:58.800
So I can't even
leave the house now?

59:59.700 --> 1:00:01.402
You're not well.

1:00:02.537 --> 1:00:04.338
You don't even seem
to realize that.

1:00:04.372 --> 1:00:05.673
It's terribly sad.

1:00:05.706 --> 1:00:06.974
No, no, Margaret.

1:00:07.008 --> 1:00:08.409
Margaret, I'm not ill.

1:00:08.442 --> 1:00:11.112
Your mother, she was
ill too, wasn't she?

1:00:11.145 --> 1:00:13.648
You don't know
anything about my mother.

1:00:13.681 --> 1:00:15.449
Did she scream
at her sleep too?

1:00:15.483 --> 1:00:16.517
- Give me the key.
- No.

1:00:16.551 --> 1:00:17.585
- Give me the key!
- No!

1:00:19.787 --> 1:00:21.088
I'm leaving.

1:00:21.122 --> 1:00:23.491
- You have nowhere to go.
- Oh really?

1:00:23.524 --> 1:00:24.725
Really?!

1:00:24.759 --> 1:00:25.827
You can spare me
the histrionics.

1:00:25.860 --> 1:00:27.562
- Crazy bitch.
- Why don't you just go

1:00:27.595 --> 1:00:29.864
up to your room and get into bed

1:00:29.897 --> 1:00:32.433
and wait for Thomas
to prepare your food?

1:01:07.134 --> 1:01:08.436
Am I a prisoner now?

1:01:10.805 --> 1:01:11.973
It's to keep you safe.

1:01:12.006 --> 1:01:13.641
Don't tell me it's
to keep me safe.

1:01:17.612 --> 1:01:18.412
Where's Margaret?

1:01:18.446 --> 1:01:20.414
She's gone to the
solicitor again.

1:01:21.482 --> 1:01:22.116
I don't know why.

1:01:22.984 --> 1:01:24.418
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

1:01:25.486 --> 1:01:27.188
I've been thinking about what
you were saying in the nursery

1:01:27.222 --> 1:01:32.126
and I am sorry if you think
that I am being ungrateful.

1:01:33.461 --> 1:01:34.562
I don't think you're
being ungrateful.

1:01:34.595 --> 1:01:36.097
I just want to say thank you

1:01:37.164 --> 1:01:42.103
for being someone in here
that I can call a friend.

1:01:43.671 --> 1:01:44.472
Yes.

1:01:45.640 --> 1:01:46.574
Someone who gets it.

1:01:48.609 --> 1:01:50.978
Someone to look after me.

1:01:54.582 --> 1:01:56.183
I'm just glad you
finally see that.

1:02:03.691 --> 1:02:05.927
I think I'm gonna
head up to bed.

1:02:05.960 --> 1:02:06.794
Okay.

1:02:09.897 --> 1:02:11.132
Charlotte.

1:02:11.165 --> 1:02:12.900
I was gonna make dinner.

1:02:12.934 --> 1:02:14.468
Oh, I'm quite tired.

1:02:15.102 --> 1:02:16.971
Okay, okay.

1:02:17.004 --> 1:02:17.972
Thanks though.

1:02:18.005 --> 1:02:18.806
Good night.

1:02:20.007 --> 1:02:25.012
Good night.

1:04:10.785 --> 1:04:12.019
Charlotte!

1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:17.691
Oh god.

1:04:27.635 --> 1:04:28.936
Charlotte, wait!

1:04:30.738 --> 1:04:31.939
No no no!

1:04:31.972 --> 1:04:33.174
No no no!

1:04:33.208 --> 1:04:34.242
No no!

1:04:34.276 --> 1:04:35.109
Stop!

1:05:10.978 --> 1:05:11.812
Charlotte!

1:05:16.218 --> 1:05:17.051
Shit.

1:05:18.152 --> 1:05:19.920
Charlotte!

1:05:26.328 --> 1:05:28.162
Wait, Charlotte, stop!

1:05:30.131 --> 1:05:31.132
Stop, don't!

1:05:32.133 --> 1:05:32.967
Stop!

1:05:43.043 --> 1:05:44.645
Charlotte, don't!

1:05:46.714 --> 1:05:51.719
Charlotte, stop!

1:05:53.087 --> 1:05:53.921
No.

1:05:56.324 --> 1:05:57.791
No no no, the baby.

1:05:57.825 --> 1:05:59.394
Please, Charlotte, the baby.

1:05:59.427 --> 1:06:00.228
Charlotte, stop.

1:06:02.196 --> 1:06:04.665
You're not well, Charlotte.

1:06:05.833 --> 1:06:06.667
Charlotte!

1:06:08.303 --> 1:06:09.136
Charlotte!

1:06:19.880 --> 1:06:21.349
Hello?

1:06:21.383 --> 1:06:23.851
Please, you have to come
and get me, they're coming.

1:06:26.987 --> 1:06:27.821
Where are you?

1:06:31.158 --> 1:06:32.826
I don't-

1:06:32.860 --> 1:06:33.761
I'll meet you by
the fields where I gave you

1:06:33.794 --> 1:06:34.795
- riding lessons.
- Yeah.

1:06:36.030 --> 1:06:36.964
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay, I'll Be there.

1:06:36.997 --> 1:06:38.466
- All right.
- Stay calm.

1:06:38.500 --> 1:06:39.767
Okay, thanks a bunch.

1:06:39.800 --> 1:06:41.735
I'm coming now, okay?

1:07:49.571 --> 1:07:52.873
Charlotte.

1:08:15.430 --> 1:08:16.830
You're all right.

1:08:19.267 --> 1:08:21.403
- It's gonna be okay.
- Yeah.

1:08:21.436 --> 1:08:22.504
Yeah?

1:08:22.537 --> 1:08:23.371
Yeah.

1:10:13.080 --> 1:10:14.948
Thomas?

1:10:16.016 --> 1:10:17.050
Thomas.

1:10:19.086 --> 1:10:19.920
Thomas!

1:10:21.121 --> 1:10:23.658
Yes, Margaret?

1:10:23.691 --> 1:10:27.529
Can you bring my
supper upstairs to my bedroom?

1:10:27.562 --> 1:10:28.996
- Now?
- Yes, now.

1:10:32.467 --> 1:10:34.034
There's a good boy.

1:10:37.037 --> 1:10:37.938
Margaret?

1:10:39.774 --> 1:10:44.945
Margaret, I can hear
you, open the door.

1:10:45.380 --> 1:10:46.448
Charlotte?

1:10:46.481 --> 1:10:49.049
Look, you had me worried.

1:10:49.082 --> 1:10:51.018
I thought you might
lose the baby.

1:10:51.051 --> 1:10:53.221
Margaret, you have
to open the door.

1:10:53.254 --> 1:10:57.592
Can't have you running
around like a mad woman.

1:11:01.061 --> 1:11:05.266
I know this is hard
work, but at least

1:11:05.300 --> 1:11:07.100
here I can keep an eye on you.

1:11:08.303 --> 1:11:09.771
You're sick.

1:11:11.539 --> 1:11:16.076
Don't you realize
you're the one who's sick!

1:11:16.109 --> 1:11:18.145
I don't enjoy this.

1:11:20.682 --> 1:11:23.618
Maybe some time on your
own will do you good.

1:12:20.208 --> 1:12:21.041
Thomas?

1:12:22.810 --> 1:12:24.512
You need to help me, please.

1:12:27.147 --> 1:12:29.049
I'm not supposed
to talk to you.

1:12:31.219 --> 1:12:32.420
I don't feel well.

1:12:37.124 --> 1:12:38.726
There's something wrong with me.

1:12:39.894 --> 1:12:40.728
My head.

1:12:41.763 --> 1:12:44.566
Hopefully once the baby's
out you're gonna feel better.

1:12:45.767 --> 1:12:46.668
What if I don't?

1:12:48.369 --> 1:12:49.202
You will.

1:12:51.372 --> 1:12:52.172
No, don't go!

1:12:54.576 --> 1:12:56.277
I'm sorry for
running away, Thomas.

1:12:58.145 --> 1:12:59.280
I was just scared.

1:13:01.649 --> 1:13:04.252
I don't like seeing
you like this, Charlotte.

1:13:06.688 --> 1:13:09.624
You have to start
helping yourself.

1:14:06.814 --> 1:14:08.249
She's out all afternoon.

1:14:11.719 --> 1:14:13.287
I'm making us lunch.

1:14:33.908 --> 1:14:35.209
Can I go for a bath?

1:14:36.310 --> 1:14:38.513
Yes, of course you can.

1:14:38.546 --> 1:14:40.180
I'll bring up some towels.

1:17:40.461 --> 1:17:41.495
Lunch is ready.

1:17:53.608 --> 1:17:55.576
Why do you stick around?

1:17:59.447 --> 1:18:00.615
It's my home.

1:18:02.917 --> 1:18:04.118
Family's important.

1:18:04.151 --> 1:18:06.654
Do you really
feel at home here?

1:18:06.687 --> 1:18:07.555
Of course I do.

1:18:10.992 --> 1:18:12.994
She doesn't treat
you like you're family.

1:18:16.564 --> 1:18:17.465
That's not true.

1:18:21.135 --> 1:18:22.570
She uses you.

1:18:26.641 --> 1:18:28.576
We've been through
a lot together.

1:18:30.912 --> 1:18:31.746
With your dad.

1:18:36.717 --> 1:18:38.419
Your mum, what was she like?

1:18:39.754 --> 1:18:41.055
She was a piano teacher.

1:18:42.823 --> 1:18:43.791
But she was sick.

1:18:45.126 --> 1:18:47.495
She had this thing
called perinatal psychosis,

1:18:49.130 --> 1:18:51.632
and severe postpartum
depression.

1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:57.004
Basically, she just couldn't
cope with being a mum.

1:18:57.038 --> 1:18:58.439
So blamed me.

1:19:00.541 --> 1:19:01.442
Never really...

1:19:05.846 --> 1:19:06.681
Your turn.

1:19:08.216 --> 1:19:10.518
Tell me something about
your father, then.

1:19:12.720 --> 1:19:13.654
He was a drunk.

1:19:16.757 --> 1:19:17.558
And?

1:19:20.928 --> 1:19:22.230
He was a horrible drunk.

1:19:24.732 --> 1:19:25.900
And he used to beat me.

1:19:30.037 --> 1:19:33.474
But then when we moved here,
he beat Margaret instead.

1:19:37.279 --> 1:19:38.479
She sort of...

1:19:40.014 --> 1:19:42.583
She managed to absorb it.

1:19:44.151 --> 1:19:45.586
She was a lot braver than me.

1:19:49.690 --> 1:19:50.491
But...

1:19:52.793 --> 1:19:57.665
One night, he beat her so badly
that she shattered her hip.

1:20:01.168 --> 1:20:02.003
God.

1:20:05.039 --> 1:20:06.107
You could hear her.

1:20:15.217 --> 1:20:17.319
When she was in hospital, he
just sat around the house,

1:20:17.352 --> 1:20:20.621
drinking and shouting, all day,

1:20:22.923 --> 1:20:27.161
until eventually, I
found him passed out

1:20:27.194 --> 1:20:28.796
upstairs on the landing.

1:20:31.932 --> 1:20:32.900
Just lying there.

1:20:35.669 --> 1:20:37.272
Completely useless.

1:20:41.876 --> 1:20:45.713
And I don't know why, but...

1:20:47.882 --> 1:20:49.917
I suddenly knew
exactly what to do.

1:20:54.922 --> 1:20:55.990
And I'm glad I did it.

1:20:59.361 --> 1:21:00.761
What did you do?

1:21:13.808 --> 1:21:15.377
I knew they were
threshing the top field,

1:21:15.410 --> 1:21:19.580
so I picked him up and
dragged him up there,

1:21:20.915 --> 1:21:22.683
into the middle of the
field, right into the middle,

1:21:22.716 --> 1:21:23.684
and I left him.

1:21:26.720 --> 1:21:29.590
And I knew the combines
wouldn't see him in the morning.

1:21:35.663 --> 1:21:38.233
Did Ben know
about any of this?

1:21:38.266 --> 1:21:39.100
Ben?

1:21:42.837 --> 1:21:45.139
Ben wouldn't have done anything.

1:21:45.172 --> 1:21:46.274
I did, I did it.

1:21:47.342 --> 1:21:48.142
Me.

1:21:54.715 --> 1:21:56.218
Don't worry, it's not murder.

1:21:57.352 --> 1:21:58.152
It's not.

1:22:01.188 --> 1:22:02.089
She needed me.

1:22:05.793 --> 1:22:08.230
And I'd do the same for
you, if you needed me to.

1:22:12.400 --> 1:22:13.235
I understand.

1:22:36.891 --> 1:22:39.227
Please don't
make me force you.

1:22:59.880 --> 1:23:01.715
Something else I
need to tell you.

1:23:03.817 --> 1:23:05.886
She's been selling the cottage.

1:23:07.255 --> 1:23:08.756
What?

1:23:08.789 --> 1:23:10.691
The bank never foreclosed.

1:23:12.960 --> 1:23:15.363
And I told her to tell
you, but she said not to.

1:23:17.898 --> 1:23:18.766
So I can move back in?

1:23:18.799 --> 1:23:20.801
No, no no no, it's gone.

1:23:22.836 --> 1:23:23.904
She can't do that.

1:23:23.938 --> 1:23:25.440
That was my house, Thomas.

1:23:25.473 --> 1:23:27.841
I know, but that's the thing.

1:23:29.511 --> 1:23:33.781
This can be your house
now, here, with us.

1:23:36.351 --> 1:23:38.752
You're gonna get
better, and then,

1:23:38.786 --> 1:23:40.854
and maybe then you
and me, we can...

1:23:42.357 --> 1:23:43.824
Maybe we can...

1:23:47.027 --> 1:23:50.130
Look, this room, it's
all gonna be over soon.

1:23:51.999 --> 1:23:54.001
Just do as you're told.

1:23:56.070 --> 1:23:56.904
Thomas.

1:23:58.273 --> 1:24:00.774
- I have to go.
- Where are you going?

1:24:00.808 --> 1:24:02.776
Wait, where are you going?

1:24:02.810 --> 1:24:04.845
Why, Thomas, wait, no, please.

1:24:04.878 --> 1:24:06.013
Wait!

1:24:06.046 --> 1:24:07.114
Wait!

1:24:07.147 --> 1:24:08.350
Thomas, please don't leave me!

1:24:08.383 --> 1:24:10.918
Just talk to me,
don't leave me alone!

1:24:11.852 --> 1:24:13.954
Don't leave me alone.

1:24:13.988 --> 1:24:18.792
I really, really like you,
and maybe more than I should,

1:24:21.161 --> 1:24:24.164
and I think we have a
connection, you know,

1:24:24.198 --> 1:24:29.069
something special, and maybe
you're right, maybe me and you,

1:24:29.103 --> 1:24:32.340
maybe we could leave,
maybe we could just go.

1:24:32.374 --> 1:24:37.111
Together, me and you, we
can raise the baby, Thomas.

1:24:37.144 --> 1:24:40.848
Please, me and you, we can
do it, but we have to go.

1:24:40.881 --> 1:24:42.584
We both have to get
out, Thomas, please,

1:24:42.617 --> 1:24:43.518
I need you to get
out of this house.

1:24:53.027 --> 1:24:56.196
You really are a twisted
piece of work, aren't you?

1:24:56.231 --> 1:24:57.931
You sold my house!

1:24:57.965 --> 1:25:00.435
No, I sold Ben's house.

1:25:00.468 --> 1:25:02.936
I did it for us.

1:25:02.970 --> 1:25:04.306
And making Thomas
kill his own father?

1:25:04.339 --> 1:25:05.206
Who was that for?

1:25:06.940 --> 1:25:09.377
Thomas and Ben
had more allegiance

1:25:09.411 --> 1:25:12.012
to this family than
you will ever know.

1:25:12.046 --> 1:25:14.948
Ben hated you!

1:25:14.982 --> 1:25:17.851
He was desperate to get away
from here and away from you!

1:25:19.287 --> 1:25:23.924
Please don't speak about
my beautiful, dead son!

1:25:25.059 --> 1:25:25.959
You should have had the things

1:25:25.993 --> 1:25:27.194
we said about you, Margaret.

1:25:27.228 --> 1:25:29.364
How he would laugh
and laugh about you.

1:25:29.397 --> 1:25:31.999
You keep your poison
away from Thomas,

1:25:32.032 --> 1:25:33.867
and from now on, you
will deal only with me.

1:25:33.901 --> 1:25:35.236
Do you understand that?

1:25:35.270 --> 1:25:36.371
You don't even care about him.

1:25:36.404 --> 1:25:38.005
You only care about yourself.

1:25:38.038 --> 1:25:39.873
I care about this family.

1:25:39.907 --> 1:25:42.042
Which is more than
can be said about you.

1:25:42.076 --> 1:25:45.246
Yeah, when I give birth,
I'm gonna tell everybody

1:25:45.280 --> 1:25:48.283
what you've done,
everyone in that hospital.

1:25:48.316 --> 1:25:50.418
We're not taking
you to the hospital.

1:25:51.919 --> 1:25:53.488
The birth is going
to happen here.

1:25:53.521 --> 1:25:54.955
Dr. Richards will oversee it.

1:25:56.358 --> 1:25:59.461
But Margaret, you can't
do that, that's crazy.

1:25:59.494 --> 1:26:01.363
Well, I had my
baby in this house,

1:26:01.396 --> 1:26:03.163
my dear, and so can you.

1:26:03.197 --> 1:26:05.132
Dr. Richards is
more than capable.

1:26:09.002 --> 1:26:09.903
I'm sorry, Margaret!

1:26:15.710 --> 1:26:18.011
Come closer, I need
to tell you something.

1:26:19.179 --> 1:26:20.981
Excuse me?

1:26:21.014 --> 1:26:21.882
Come closer.

1:26:23.518 --> 1:26:24.586
What is it?

1:26:26.654 --> 1:26:28.256
Closer.

1:26:31.925 --> 1:26:34.928
I have no interest in
anything you want to say to me.

1:26:34.962 --> 1:26:36.196
No.

1:28:12.660 --> 1:28:14.094
Thomas!

1:28:16.264 --> 1:28:17.499
Thomas!

1:28:17.532 --> 1:28:19.199
Help!

1:28:21.569 --> 1:28:23.036
Is it coming?

1:28:23.070 --> 1:28:24.171
Is it coming?

1:28:25.340 --> 1:28:27.342
We need to go to the
hospital right now.

1:28:27.375 --> 1:28:29.009
- Right now.
- Okay.

1:28:29.911 --> 1:28:31.312
- I'll get Margaret.
- No no no, there's no time.

1:28:31.346 --> 1:28:32.347
We need to go now.

1:28:32.380 --> 1:28:33.214
Thomas?

1:28:34.616 --> 1:28:35.583
Margaret, I think we have
to go to the hospital.

1:28:35.617 --> 1:28:36.784
The baby's in trouble.

1:28:36.818 --> 1:28:38.653
I'll go and
telephone Dr. Richards.

1:28:38.686 --> 1:28:41.088
Just not until I
call the doctor.

1:28:41.121 --> 1:28:42.223
No, Margaret, I think
we have to go now,

1:28:42.257 --> 1:28:43.458
the baby's in trouble.

1:28:43.491 --> 1:28:45.360
Look here, you stupid
boy, don't you realize

1:28:45.393 --> 1:28:46.794
what she's up to?

1:28:46.828 --> 1:28:48.263
She's bleeding,
I'm taking her.

1:28:48.296 --> 1:28:49.196
She needs me.

1:28:49.230 --> 1:28:50.798
You are not taking her!

1:28:50.832 --> 1:28:52.300
Stop it, Margaret!

1:28:53.701 --> 1:28:55.202
I'm taking her, come on, go.

1:28:56.237 --> 1:28:57.539
Margaret, stop it.

1:29:00.241 --> 1:29:01.376
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:29:01.409 --> 1:29:03.211
I'm sorry, Margaret, I'm sorry.

1:29:04.646 --> 1:29:06.179
I don't understand what's
happening, is it coming?

1:29:06.214 --> 1:29:07.615
No, it can't be,
it's too early!

1:29:07.649 --> 1:29:09.517
Is it still moving, is
the baby still moving?

1:29:09.551 --> 1:29:12.287
I don't know, it just
hurts, it just hurts, oh god.

1:29:12.320 --> 1:29:15.256
Look Charlotte,
whatever they say,

1:29:15.290 --> 1:29:18.359
you gotta know that I had no
idea it would do this, okay?

1:29:18.393 --> 1:29:19.594
What are you
talking about, Thomas?

1:29:19.627 --> 1:29:21.763
It was just some stuff
to help keep you calm,

1:29:21.796 --> 1:29:24.666
stuff to help you sleep better.

1:29:24.699 --> 1:29:26.133
Well, what did you give me?

1:29:26.166 --> 1:29:27.435
But then you just
kept trying to run away.

1:29:27.468 --> 1:29:29.136
I don't know why you
wanted to leave so much.

1:29:29.169 --> 1:29:31.372
We're family, you and
me, we can be a family.

1:29:31.406 --> 1:29:33.608
No no, what did you give me,
Thomas? What did you give me?

1:29:33.641 --> 1:29:34.809
Look, I'm sorry,
it was stupid.

1:29:34.842 --> 1:29:36.477
It was stupid, it
was stupid, I'll tell

1:29:36.511 --> 1:29:39.247
Dr. Richards everything, I
promise, he'll know what to do.

1:29:39.280 --> 1:29:41.148
No, we have to
go to the hospital!

1:29:41.181 --> 1:29:43.518
You can't take me there, Thomas!

1:29:47.322 --> 1:29:48.121
Let's go.

1:29:48.155 --> 1:29:48.957
I can't move.

1:29:48.990 --> 1:29:50.658
I can't move, you
have to get him.

1:29:50.692 --> 1:29:53.795
You have to get him, get
him, get him, get him now!

1:29:53.828 --> 1:29:55.162
Okay.

1:30:03.671 --> 1:30:04.639
Dr. Richards?

1:30:04.672 --> 1:30:06.139
He's with a patient.

1:30:06.173 --> 1:30:07.342
How can I help you, sir?

1:30:07.375 --> 1:30:08.876
- Sir?
- Dr. Richards?

1:30:08.910 --> 1:30:10.778
Need help outside
in the car, please.

1:30:12.213 --> 1:30:12.847
Okay.

1:30:36.237 --> 1:30:37.238
Charlotte?

1:30:37.271 --> 1:30:38.606
Thomas!

1:30:38.640 --> 1:30:39.841
No, no, no, no, no.

1:30:39.874 --> 1:30:41.342
Charlotte, Charlotte,
what are you doing?

1:30:41.376 --> 1:30:43.911
Thomas, help!

1:30:43.945 --> 1:30:44.879
Charlotte.

1:30:44.912 --> 1:30:45.880
No no no no.

1:30:47.281 --> 1:30:48.549
Charlotte!

1:30:48.583 --> 1:30:50.485
Charlotte, no no no no!

1:30:51.753 --> 1:30:53.254
Charlotte!

1:31:00.361 --> 1:31:01.129
Charlotte!

1:31:09.937 --> 1:31:10.772
Yes!

1:31:12.240 --> 1:31:12.874
Oh my god!

1:32:39.694 --> 1:32:40.528
Thanks.

1:32:40.561 --> 1:32:42.797
- Hi.
- Hi Charlotte.

1:32:42.830 --> 1:32:44.899
Hey, where's the
where's the baby?

1:32:44.932 --> 1:32:47.301
- Is he okay?
- The baby's fine.

1:32:47.335 --> 1:32:49.437
He's in the postnatal ward.

1:32:49.470 --> 1:32:50.671
I'm Dr. Rios.

1:32:50.705 --> 1:32:52.306
I'm one of the consultants here.

1:32:53.674 --> 1:32:56.644
Charlotte, do you
remember how you got here?

1:32:56.677 --> 1:32:58.646
There was a crash.

1:32:58.679 --> 1:33:00.314
That's right.

1:33:00.348 --> 1:33:01.816
You were very lucky.

1:33:01.849 --> 1:33:03.618
All the swelling has gone down.

1:33:03.651 --> 1:33:06.454
You have no internal
injuries, no broken bones.

1:33:06.487 --> 1:33:07.321
Just bruising.

1:33:08.790 --> 1:33:13.461
So when can I see the baby?

1:33:13.494 --> 1:33:14.896
Because I haven't seen him.

1:33:14.929 --> 1:33:15.963
Soon.

1:33:15.997 --> 1:33:19.767
But because of your medical
records and the crash,

1:33:19.801 --> 1:33:22.436
social services have
advised that you

1:33:22.470 --> 1:33:24.939
can't be alone with
the child for now.

1:33:24.972 --> 1:33:26.374
What?

1:33:26.407 --> 1:33:27.608
Why?

1:33:27.642 --> 1:33:28.810
It's okay to have
supervised visits.

1:33:28.843 --> 1:33:31.345
We should be able to
clear it up soon enough.

1:33:31.379 --> 1:33:35.483
No, no, I don't
want to do that.

1:33:35.516 --> 1:33:37.819
It's okay, Charlotte,
just stay calm.

1:33:37.852 --> 1:33:39.053
I'm very calm, I just want to-

1:33:39.086 --> 1:33:40.488
- Stay in bed for me, please.

1:33:40.521 --> 1:33:41.322
Just tell me where he is.

1:33:41.355 --> 1:33:42.924
He's with his
father, all right?

1:33:42.957 --> 1:33:44.392
If you can just lie
back down, please.

1:33:44.425 --> 1:33:48.529
- What?
- Okay?

1:33:48.563 --> 1:33:50.498
Look who it is.

1:33:50.531 --> 1:33:51.566
Oh, Mommy.

1:33:51.599 --> 1:33:52.900
- Look who it is.
- No no no.

1:33:52.934 --> 1:33:54.468
That's not the dad.

1:33:54.502 --> 1:33:55.736
That's not.

1:33:57.038 --> 1:33:58.706
Just stay calm for
me, okay Charlotte?

1:34:00.474 --> 1:34:01.576
- Thomas, what are you doing?
- Charlotte.

1:34:01.609 --> 1:34:03.444
Please, please, Charlotte.

1:34:03.477 --> 1:34:04.712
Charlotte.

1:34:04.745 --> 1:34:05.947
Thomas, get away from him!

1:34:05.980 --> 1:34:08.549
Give me back my fucking child!

1:34:08.583 --> 1:34:10.818
Get him away from the baby!

1:34:12.520 --> 1:34:13.387
No!

1:34:14.488 --> 1:34:15.857
Please, you have
to listen to me.

1:34:16.958 --> 1:34:19.493
You have to listen to me!

1:34:19.527 --> 1:34:21.596
He put something in my tea!

1:34:26.467 --> 1:34:27.535
He was gonna...

1:34:28.903 --> 1:34:30.504
What are you doing?

1:34:32.073 --> 1:34:32.907
Please, Thomas.

1:34:39.447 --> 1:34:41.482
We're gonna get you help.

1:34:41.515 --> 1:34:42.516
Thomas!

1:34:43.651 --> 1:34:45.419
Give me the baby.

1:34:45.453 --> 1:34:46.454
Open the door.

1:34:46.487 --> 1:34:47.755
