01:34.218 --> 01:35.261
Hey!

02:02.121 --> 02:03.247
Commissioner?

02:03.873 --> 02:05.249
Nope. Me.

02:06.334 --> 02:07.418
I got a problem.

02:08.336 --> 02:09.962
And you want my help?

02:11.422 --> 02:13.382
Let's get something straight
from the get-go.

02:13.591 --> 02:16.761
I think you're a freak and a menace,
and those are your good points.

02:17.303 --> 02:20.139
But the commish says you serve
a purpose, so I go along.

02:21.015 --> 02:24.143
I appreciate your honesty.
What's the problem?

02:24.727 --> 02:26.062
Somebody's got it in for me.

02:26.145 --> 02:28.230
Tried to give me
a fender massage last night.

02:28.481 --> 02:30.775
It ain't the first time. Last week too.

02:30.983 --> 02:32.151
Any suspects?

02:32.318 --> 02:34.445
So many they could
have their own zip code.

02:34.945 --> 02:37.031
I've put a lot of guys away
and they hate me for it.

02:37.406 --> 02:40.201
Looks like one of them hates me
enough to do something about it.

02:41.118 --> 02:44.038
Why me?
Why not just go to the department?

02:44.622 --> 02:46.165
I step on a lot of toes.

02:46.374 --> 02:49.377
I don't want Internal Affairs
looking at me too close.

02:49.585 --> 02:51.962
They might find some things
I don't want found.

02:52.171 --> 02:54.006
- Are you on the take?
- Watch it, freak!

02:54.173 --> 02:56.258
I never took a dime from nobody!

02:56.384 --> 02:58.969
Ijust bend the rules
a little sometimes.

02:59.136 --> 03:00.346
You understand.

03:00.930 --> 03:02.223
We're not all that different.

03:02.390 --> 03:05.726
We're on the same side,
but we're not the same.

03:06.227 --> 03:10.106
I'll help you find out who's after you,
but you've got to collar them clean.

03:10.272 --> 03:12.983
File copies of my cases
from five years back.

03:13.150 --> 03:14.985
Don't wanna run them on the system here.

03:15.111 --> 03:16.862
You find the guy then tell me.

03:17.113 --> 03:20.408
I'll take it from there.
Sound fair, partner?

03:46.934 --> 03:47.935
Ugh.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.316
There's a doormat outside, Mr. Bullock.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.903
Really? I thought you were
the doormat around here, Nivens.

04:01.407 --> 04:04.285
Don't crowd me, dork,
or I'll wipe my feet on you.

04:05.411 --> 04:06.454
Ahem.

04:06.537 --> 04:10.458
Take out your garbage once in a while.
Your apartment stinks.

04:10.666 --> 04:12.960
I won't have roaches in my building!

04:13.461 --> 04:16.088
And turn the heat down
when you're out all day!

04:16.172 --> 04:17.965
Happy holidays, Nivens.

04:25.264 --> 04:26.265
Huh!

04:40.237 --> 04:41.906
Thank heaven for rent control.

04:44.116 --> 04:46.368
We are speaking of the
same person, are we not?

04:46.452 --> 04:50.831
Harvey Bullock? The detective
who looks like an unmade bed?

04:51.081 --> 04:52.208
The same.

04:52.625 --> 04:56.086
He came to you for help?
It must be serious.

04:56.879 --> 05:00.299
It'll take the system a while
to collate and cross-index the names.

05:00.549 --> 05:01.926
I'll be back later.

05:03.761 --> 05:06.138
I thought you were through
with your rounds for tonight.

05:07.223 --> 05:10.976
Not yet. I have a feeling Bullock's
going to need a guardian angel.

05:21.278 --> 05:24.031
Stay sharp. These perps are bad news.

05:24.114 --> 05:26.909
Scagged a couple of bank guards
Christmas day.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.543
Police! Nobody move!

05:40.464 --> 05:41.757
Hey! Hold it!

06:18.919 --> 06:20.045
Give it up, hairball!

06:38.063 --> 06:39.189
What are you doing here?

06:40.024 --> 06:42.818
Watching your back. Good thing, too.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.988
I asked you to find a name,
not hold my hand.

06:46.280 --> 06:47.656
You're welcome.

06:50.784 --> 06:52.119
I have some questions.

06:52.494 --> 06:55.247
Later. After my shift.
Where do I find you?

06:55.331 --> 06:56.624
I'll find you.

06:59.668 --> 07:00.753
Show-off.

07:03.589 --> 07:04.590
On your feet.

07:04.715 --> 07:06.884
Harv? You need a hand up here?

07:07.927 --> 07:09.637
Just reading this jerk his rights.

07:10.220 --> 07:11.972
You got the right to remain silent.

07:12.056 --> 07:14.850
If you give up that right
you'll probably bore me to tears.

07:14.934 --> 07:17.227
So keep your trap shut, dog-breath.

07:29.281 --> 07:30.574
Questions, remember?

07:32.368 --> 07:35.037
Sheesh! You take some chances, freak.

07:37.164 --> 07:39.667
- Are these all the threats you received?
- Yeah.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.669
I'm thinking of starting a scrapbook.

07:44.213 --> 07:45.506
You dusted them for prints?

07:46.465 --> 07:48.133
Yep. <i>Nada.</i>

07:48.842 --> 07:50.761
Hand-delivered to my mailbox.

07:52.596 --> 07:54.848
Someone's gone to a lot
of effort to scare you.

07:55.182 --> 07:56.934
But I don't think
they're trying to kill you.

07:58.018 --> 08:01.480
Yeah? That attack last night
seemed pretty sincere.

08:04.024 --> 08:07.194
A professional hit man would
do you here, not on the street.

08:07.653 --> 08:08.654
So what?

08:08.737 --> 08:12.032
The guy who gets whacked by an amateur
is just as stiff as a pro job.

08:15.744 --> 08:17.621
When you gonna get me
that list of names?

08:22.835 --> 08:25.087
I wonder how Gordon puts up with this.

09:39.495 --> 09:42.623
Bullock? You okay?
You don't look so good.

09:42.790 --> 09:45.876
I mean, you never look good,
but today you look worse.

09:46.251 --> 09:50.005
After 15 years working in this cesspool,
I'd like to see how good you look.

09:50.506 --> 09:52.674
Well, you're sure
full of holiday spirit.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.218
What are you doing for New Year's?

09:54.843 --> 09:57.221
Same thing I did for Christmas.
My laundry.

10:10.150 --> 10:12.986
- Bullock.
- You got what I want, pointy ears?

10:13.695 --> 10:16.490
You were right, Bullock.
A lot of people don't like you.

10:16.698 --> 10:18.534
The list of suspects was a long one.

10:19.326 --> 10:21.954
Does the name Vincent Starkey
mean anything to you?

10:22.496 --> 10:24.039
Vinnie the Shark? Yeah.

10:24.456 --> 10:26.542
The dirtbag threatened me in open court.

10:26.625 --> 10:30.045
Ran a drug lab in South Gotham.
I broke it up when I was in Vice.

10:30.129 --> 10:32.005
He got 10 to 20 in Stonegate.

10:32.589 --> 10:36.260
Starkey was a model prisoner.
He only did eight years.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.345
He's out, Bullock.

10:38.428 --> 10:42.141
I cost him an empire.
He'd love to see me take a dirt nap.

10:42.641 --> 10:43.767
Where do we find him?

10:44.059 --> 10:47.104
I'm working on it.
I want you to follow up on a lead.

10:47.312 --> 10:49.314
Hey, what am I, some wet-eared rookie?

10:49.523 --> 10:52.151
Nobody tells me
how to conduct an investigation.

10:52.359 --> 10:54.027
Do you wanna live, Bullock?

10:55.320 --> 10:56.905
Then pay attention.

10:58.574 --> 11:02.202
Summer Gleeson did an expose
on South Gotham crack houses last week.

11:02.536 --> 11:04.204
She might have heard something
about Vinnie.

11:04.454 --> 11:06.206
So, see the woman, huh?

11:06.373 --> 11:09.459
- What are you gonna do?
- Make a few inquiries.

11:09.626 --> 11:12.087
Inquiries? Like what?

11:12.337 --> 11:15.465
Hey, pal, this is my life
we're talking about here!

11:23.223 --> 11:24.933
Bullock? What are you doing here?

11:25.559 --> 11:29.229
Need a favor, Gleeson.
That shoot you did down in crack town?

11:29.771 --> 11:32.107
You still owe me
for the last favor I did you.

11:32.608 --> 11:34.985
Hey, Summer,
where's your Christmas spirit?

11:35.235 --> 11:36.570
You know you can trust me.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.531
I trust you about as far
as I can throw you.

11:42.326 --> 11:43.869
Come on, Gleeson.

11:46.246 --> 11:48.207
You're lucky I talk to you
at all, Bullock.

11:49.958 --> 11:52.502
Tell you what. Come back in an hour.

12:25.535 --> 12:29.581
Here you go, my friend.
And a happy New Year to you.

12:30.374 --> 12:33.418
Free enterprise.
What makes America great.

12:40.133 --> 12:41.301
Batman!

12:42.010 --> 12:43.095
What... What do you want?

12:43.262 --> 12:45.931
Not what, slime ball, who.

12:46.014 --> 12:47.182
Vinnie the Shark.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.977
He's not my connection anymore.

12:50.352 --> 12:51.645
Wrong answer.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.079
Take two.

13:09.413 --> 13:11.415
Okay, okay, okay!

13:22.759 --> 13:24.803
Aren't you a piece of work.

13:25.762 --> 13:28.932
You gotta help me, Gleeson.
I need to find Vinnie the Shark.

13:29.016 --> 13:32.060
You wanna find a shark?
You can jump in Gotham Bay!

13:32.227 --> 13:35.272
You've blown it big time, Bullock.
Don't ever come to me again.

13:35.939 --> 13:39.651
Summer, cut me some slack.
This guy's looking to whack me.

13:39.735 --> 13:42.738
Look on the bright side.
You'll make the 6:00 news.

13:55.208 --> 13:56.251
Taxi.

14:04.634 --> 14:05.719
Get in.

14:06.470 --> 14:07.512
Hey!

14:11.016 --> 14:13.894
You got a serious
attitude problem, freak.

14:14.061 --> 14:15.645
You want the Shark or not?

14:15.812 --> 14:16.938
You know where he is?

14:17.272 --> 14:20.942
He's running rock crystal out of
an abandoned auto plant out in Bayside.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.112
Nice starship you got here.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.365
What's this for?

14:27.074 --> 14:28.825
Passenger ejector seat.

14:34.331 --> 14:38.502
Something about this still bothers me.
Starkey's not one to make idle threats.

14:38.585 --> 14:40.712
Why would he warn you to leave town?

14:41.171 --> 14:42.923
The sicko wanted to see me sweat.

14:43.173 --> 14:44.674
Come on, let's get this over with.

14:55.102 --> 14:59.314
Careful with that merchandise, boys.
You break it, you buy it. Capisce?

15:17.666 --> 15:18.708
Nobody move!

15:20.293 --> 15:23.713
Nice entrance.
Still haven't lost your sense of timing.

15:26.633 --> 15:27.676
Hey!

15:28.510 --> 15:29.636
Down!

15:37.352 --> 15:39.980
Taking out the Batman
will make me look good in Gotham.

15:40.439 --> 15:44.568
But the real pleasure's
gonna be taking you out, Bullock.

15:53.702 --> 15:56.371
Eight years I waited
to do this, Bullock.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.791
Now it's payback time.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.872
Merry Christmas, Vinnie.

17:21.248 --> 17:22.707
And happy New Year.

17:26.920 --> 17:28.588
Just call me Santa.

17:29.714 --> 17:32.384
And guess who's on top
of my naughty list?

17:33.927 --> 17:36.888
- No, Bullock!
- Relax, cowl-head.

17:36.972 --> 17:39.057
This dirtbag don't get off that easy.

17:39.516 --> 17:42.060
- The rest of the gang?
- Taken care of.

17:42.310 --> 17:44.020
Good. I'II radio for a wagon.

17:44.104 --> 17:45.188
You think it's over?

17:46.022 --> 17:48.775
Had to be Vinnie. Yeah. It's over.

17:48.858 --> 17:50.318
It's your call.

17:50.986 --> 17:53.321
By the way,
I still think you're a freak.

17:53.655 --> 17:54.698
But...

17:55.031 --> 17:56.074
Thanks.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.417
Okay, Vinnie.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.921
They say confession's good for the soul.

18:10.964 --> 18:13.300
You wanna tell me why
you sent me those letters?

18:13.675 --> 18:17.429
You've taken one too many shots
to the head, Bullock. What letters?

18:17.637 --> 18:21.099
Listen, scum-face,
I don't feel like playing games.

18:21.474 --> 18:23.018
I got a pile of paperwork,

18:23.101 --> 18:26.229
and Internal Affairs is all over me
like a cheap suit!

18:26.313 --> 18:27.439
So spill it!

18:27.814 --> 18:30.442
What are you gonna do? Send me to jail?

18:31.067 --> 18:33.278
I'm telling you, I don't know
what you're talking about!

18:34.446 --> 18:35.530
Get him out of here.

18:39.159 --> 18:41.411
It's just gotta be him, Montoya.

18:41.953 --> 18:43.496
There ain't nobody else.

18:52.505 --> 18:54.257
You should've taken my advice, Bullock.

18:54.341 --> 18:57.969
You should've left town.
I tried to scare you out.

18:58.595 --> 19:00.138
I didn't want it to come to this.

19:01.640 --> 19:02.724
I know you.

19:04.184 --> 19:05.477
Stay back!

19:06.186 --> 19:09.689
You wouldn't take the hints,
so now I have to settle it this way.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.817
It's your fault. I tried to warn you.

19:21.242 --> 19:22.911
I thought this wasn't over.

19:30.001 --> 19:32.295
- Nivens?
- Why wouldn't you move?

19:32.754 --> 19:34.255
Why wouldn't you get out?

19:34.798 --> 19:38.134
You and your late hours
and your filthy habits.

19:38.677 --> 19:42.639
Do you have any idea
what your apartment's worth these days?

19:43.264 --> 19:44.641
You wanted my apartment?

19:45.183 --> 19:47.560
You mean all this
was about rent control?

19:47.727 --> 19:50.397
No! I wanted you gone!

19:51.106 --> 19:53.608
You're not a tenant,
you're a pestilence!

19:53.942 --> 19:56.319
You insult me. You treat me like dirt.

19:56.569 --> 20:00.365
No jury in the world
would've convicted me!

20:04.869 --> 20:06.913
They wouldn't have convicted me!

20:08.456 --> 20:11.084
Somebody like Vinnie wants to pop me,
that's no surprise.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.044
But this...

20:14.212 --> 20:17.048
You know, it's funny.
I was thinking of moving anyway.

20:17.132 --> 20:19.217
Neighborhood's really been
going downhill lately.

20:19.592 --> 20:22.095
Look, I guess I owe you for this.

20:22.470 --> 20:25.557
Forget it, Bullock.
You've got enough problems.

21:10.143 --> 21:11.144
English - SDH
