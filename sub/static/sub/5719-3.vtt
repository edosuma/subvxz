WEBVTT

00:00.184 --> 00:01.815
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.851 --> 00:03.520
Cheeessseee!!!

00:03.554 --> 00:04.979
This is a new beginning for us.

00:04.999 --> 00:06.980
We always talked about
working together.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.548
Agh! I can't believe I have
to have surgery.

00:10.580 --> 00:13.330
Peter and I are still working
out the terms of our separation.

00:13.364 --> 00:14.898
You get them way more than I do.

00:14.932 --> 00:17.167
- Well, I'm their mother.
- Yeah. Well, I'm their father.

00:17.201 --> 00:19.870
My dad wants me to come with him
on Vancouver for the summer.

00:19.904 --> 00:22.072
But there is no way I'd miss
extreme team practice

00:22.106 --> 00:23.485
or ditch my friends.

00:23.505 --> 00:26.009
Just hope you and Peter
can work out whatever it is

00:26.043 --> 00:27.276
for the sake of those girls.

00:27.296 --> 00:29.980
Peter and I are going to do
this separation better.

00:30.014 --> 00:32.720
From now on things are gonna
be different.

00:48.399 --> 00:50.433
C'mon, Jade! You can do it!

00:50.468 --> 00:52.702
Stay back! Pull on your rein!

00:54.505 --> 00:57.040
Don't forget your spurring!

00:59.343 --> 01:02.779
8 seconds! Wait to go, Jade!

01:08.185 --> 01:10.120
- Yeah!
- Nice form!

01:10.154 --> 01:12.222
That was awesome! I can't believe
how good you're getting at this.

01:12.256 --> 01:13.519
Yeah, not bad.

01:13.539 --> 01:16.459
Will change the name of that horse
form "Hurricane" to "Gust-o'-Wind".

01:16.494 --> 01:19.329
Hey, I've been telling you,
I'm ready for a real bronc.

01:19.363 --> 01:21.197
- Hmm.
- Ha ha! She's right...

01:21.232 --> 01:22.731
- Hey.
- Hey!

01:22.751 --> 01:25.322
There's only so much she's gonna
learn on one of those crowhoppers.

01:25.342 --> 01:28.271
Oh, I didn't realize I had
a guest instructor today.

01:28.306 --> 01:30.307
Anyway, I have some exciting
news.

01:30.341 --> 01:33.109
I just booked the extreme team for
the halftime show this weekend.

01:33.144 --> 01:35.111
That's awesome! My first rodeo!

01:35.146 --> 01:36.417
That must be nice.

01:36.437 --> 01:39.282
I've been bugging Tim to let me
enter a rodeo for weeks now.

01:39.317 --> 01:41.251
Let it go, Jade.
You're not ready.

01:53.998 --> 01:58.635
I have to say, there's something
about a man wearing a tool belt.

01:58.669 --> 02:00.303
Oh yeah?

02:00.338 --> 02:03.139
Well... maybe when I'm done
with the loft

02:03.174 --> 02:05.976
I'll come in here
and build us a clinic.

02:06.010 --> 02:08.578
- Oh, that's impressive.
- Yeah, how does that sound?

02:10.146 --> 02:11.153
Can you believe it?

02:11.173 --> 02:13.116
All those times we talked
about working together...

02:13.150 --> 02:16.119
And it's almost coming true.

02:16.153 --> 02:17.821
Hey, sorry.

02:18.746 --> 02:20.957
Hey Scott. What's up?

02:22.493 --> 02:26.456
Right now?
Yeah. Sure, I'm on my way.

02:27.498 --> 02:29.466
I thought you didn't have
to work today?

02:29.500 --> 02:31.167
I don't. He just wants
to "chat".

02:31.202 --> 02:32.535
About what?

02:32.570 --> 02:33.787
I don't know. He wouldn't say.

02:33.807 --> 02:35.308
He's been acting weird
all week so...

02:35.328 --> 02:37.874
Well, He probably just wants to go
over the scheduling or something.

02:37.908 --> 02:39.609
Yeah.

02:39.644 --> 02:41.652
Uh, Ty.

02:46.717 --> 02:48.618
Oh geez.

02:50.721 --> 02:52.288
Jack, we are married.

02:52.323 --> 02:54.524
Yeah. Good thing.

02:58.195 --> 03:00.196
Katie!

03:03.134 --> 03:04.668
Daddy!!!

03:04.702 --> 03:06.987
Hey Kitty-kat! Ohhhh!

03:08.172 --> 03:09.806
I made you some pictures.

03:09.840 --> 03:12.809
You did? I can't wait to see
them. That's so cool.

03:12.843 --> 03:15.879
Hey, can you carry my big,
heavy bag into the cabin for me?

03:15.913 --> 03:17.580
Oh wow!

03:17.615 --> 03:19.542
Good job.

03:20.718 --> 03:22.085
Where's Georgie?

03:22.119 --> 03:23.453
She's at the rodeo grounds.

03:23.487 --> 03:25.388
But she'll be back
this afternoon.

03:25.423 --> 03:27.924
Maybe you can pick her up
for dinner, okay?

03:27.958 --> 03:29.292
Why do I have to wait so long?

03:29.326 --> 03:33.096
She-she failed her last math
exam,

03:33.130 --> 03:35.565
and luckily, her teacher is
willing to give her another shot.

03:35.599 --> 03:38.802
So we're gonna be studying
this afternoon.

03:38.836 --> 03:42.072
You're playing tutor, huh?
Oh boy...

03:42.106 --> 03:45.108
What-What's that supposed
to mean?

03:45.142 --> 03:46.776
Nothing. Sorry.

03:46.811 --> 03:49.079
I don't want my visit
to start this way.

03:49.113 --> 03:50.513
I'd rather say thank-you.

03:50.548 --> 03:53.221
I'm so glad we got the
separation agreement behind us.

03:53.241 --> 03:53.837
Yes.

03:53.857 --> 03:56.019
And for letting the girls come out
and see me this summer.

03:56.053 --> 03:57.456
Have you told them yet?

03:57.476 --> 04:01.357
Yes. And Katie can't stop talking about
building sand castles on the beach and...

04:01.392 --> 04:04.160
That's awesome.
What about Georgie?

04:04.195 --> 04:06.129
Yeah, you know she-she's
really...

04:06.163 --> 04:09.399
Daddy! Come see my pictures!

04:09.433 --> 04:11.134
Okay!

04:11.168 --> 04:12.602
I'll let you get settled in.

04:21.144 --> 04:23.480
Ow. What was that for?

04:27.618 --> 04:29.552
Tim just wants to make sure
you're ready.

04:29.587 --> 04:31.588
That's b.s. the rodeo
is still a man's world.

04:31.622 --> 04:34.224
Girls have to do everything
like a hundred times better

04:34.258 --> 04:36.126
just to get a shot.

04:50.341 --> 04:52.108
What are you up to?

04:52.143 --> 04:54.511
I just found out we get
to perform at Casey's rodeo.

04:54.545 --> 04:56.446
That's great.
You're totally ready!

04:56.480 --> 04:59.849
And so are these guys...
What's this for?

05:01.819 --> 05:04.287
Lots of people can do that.
Everybody's seen it.

05:04.321 --> 05:06.856
Georgie, you can't just...
add a jump.

05:06.891 --> 05:08.892
Why not? I need to blow
people's minds...

05:08.926 --> 05:10.293
Kick some butt... right?

05:10.327 --> 05:12.095
Yeah, but this is pretty
dangerous.

05:12.129 --> 05:14.864
I know. That's why I'm gonna
need your help to pull it off.

Phoenix is a jumper.
That's what he loves to do.

06:03.447 --> 06:04.847
We just need to work
with Trouble.

06:04.881 --> 06:07.483
Okay, but getting Trouble
to jump is one thing.

06:07.517 --> 06:09.585
Getting him to jump in sync
with Phoenix,

06:09.620 --> 06:11.354
while you balancing
on their backs...?

06:11.388 --> 06:13.623
I know it won't be easy.
But that's why I want to do it.

06:15.692 --> 06:17.893
- Hey!
- Hey!

06:17.928 --> 06:19.862
Extreme team just got booked
for a rodeo this weekend!

06:19.896 --> 06:22.946
What?! Georgie, that's amazing.

06:22.966 --> 06:24.567
But hey, don't forget that
your dad is in town

06:24.601 --> 06:26.335
to spend time with you.

06:26.370 --> 06:27.809
I have to practice my routine first.

06:27.829 --> 06:29.872
Uh, not right now you don't.
You and I have some study date.

06:29.906 --> 06:30.936
Seriously?

06:30.956 --> 06:35.244
We're gonna rock some ratios
and party down with polynomials.

06:35.279 --> 06:37.613
Just when I thought math
couldn't get any more lame.

06:37.648 --> 06:40.483
What?! Math is not lame,
it is totally radical.

06:40.517 --> 06:42.852
Get it? Math radicals.

06:49.693 --> 06:51.227
All right.

06:51.261 --> 06:54.497
Get your books. They're in
your backpack in the kitchen.

06:54.531 --> 06:56.995
Totally radical. Really?

07:06.777 --> 07:09.378
Hey. Thanks for coming in.

07:09.413 --> 07:10.746
Yeah. No problem.

07:10.781 --> 07:12.682
Is everything all right?

07:12.716 --> 07:15.351
Yeah, finally quiet here.

07:15.385 --> 07:18.487
I thought it would be a good
chance for us to chat.

07:18.522 --> 07:21.290
You've done an incredible job
for me over the years, Ty.

07:21.325 --> 07:23.793
You've been a great assistant...

07:23.827 --> 07:27.496
but lately I've been
reconsidering your role here...

07:27.531 --> 07:30.499
Am I getting fired? Again?

07:30.534 --> 07:34.904
No! I want to know if you'd like
to be my partner.

07:36.644 --> 07:38.374
Are you serious?

07:38.408 --> 07:40.343
Because you know I don't have
any money to invest in this?

07:40.377 --> 07:42.478
You'll make up for it
in sweat equity.

07:42.512 --> 07:45.632
You'll have to put in the hours,
be on call 24-7,

07:45.652 --> 07:48.451
And help me grow the business.

07:48.485 --> 07:52.321
Wow. I... I did not see
this coming.

07:52.356 --> 07:54.657
I'm asking for a pretty big
commitment here.

07:54.691 --> 07:56.892
So mull it over before
you say yes.

07:56.927 --> 07:59.862
Because once you're in,
it's for the long haul.

08:00.074 --> 08:02.798
Thanks, Scott. I mean it.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.196
Ow! Damn it!

08:12.442 --> 08:14.710
- Hi.
- Hey.

08:14.745 --> 08:16.579
Maybe time to drop the macho
man thing, huh?

08:16.613 --> 08:19.281
I don't know what
you're talking about?

08:19.316 --> 08:21.851
Why don't you just take some
pain meds for your shoulder.

08:21.885 --> 08:23.319
I'm fine.

08:23.353 --> 08:25.267
I'm working through it.

08:26.790 --> 08:30.326
So uh, what's going on with
Jade?

08:30.360 --> 08:31.627
I mean, she's doing great,
right?

08:31.661 --> 08:33.028
- Yeah.
- You know that.

08:33.063 --> 08:35.798
Why won't you let her enter
my rodeo?

08:35.832 --> 08:38.667
Because Jade hasn't ridden
a real bronc yet.

08:38.702 --> 08:40.169
You know the horses
in the amateur draw

08:40.203 --> 08:43.272
are no different than
the ones you use.

08:43.306 --> 08:46.909
- What? Is it because...
- No. It is not because she is a girl...

08:46.943 --> 08:48.411
If that's where you're going.

08:48.445 --> 08:51.615
Jade has more potential than
most of the guys in my class.

08:51.635 --> 08:53.582
Which is why I don't wanna throw
her in the mix early

08:53.617 --> 08:55.718
and see her get hurt.

08:55.752 --> 08:58.277
C'mon, Tim.
Is there any better way

08:58.297 --> 09:01.089
to get good at bronc riding?

09:03.782 --> 09:05.594
Thank you.

09:06.963 --> 09:10.699
Hey um, can I ask for your
advice on something?

09:12.402 --> 09:14.703
Okay. There's a switch...

09:16.006 --> 09:17.506
You know how the proceeds
of this rodeo

09:17.541 --> 09:19.375
are going to a cancer
foundation...

09:19.409 --> 09:21.444
Yeah, I think that's a good
thing.

09:21.852 --> 09:25.748
What would you think of me
naming it in honor of Hank?

09:27.551 --> 09:29.819
You know Hank? My late husband?

09:29.853 --> 09:32.922
Yeah. Yeah, that's a good thing.

09:32.956 --> 09:35.591
I was thinking something like...

09:35.625 --> 09:38.894
"Hank the tank's rodeo
for the cure".

09:38.929 --> 09:41.263
Yeah, that's also a good thing.

09:41.298 --> 09:43.132
Yeah?

09:43.166 --> 09:45.768
Thanks. I think I'm gonna
do that.

09:45.802 --> 09:47.837
Ooh.

09:47.871 --> 09:49.805
You could take something
for that.

09:53.410 --> 09:54.901
Come on.

10:01.318 --> 10:04.383
Come on, Trouble, let's go.

10:14.097 --> 10:16.298
Hey! Hey!

10:17.868 --> 10:20.369
Since when you do this kind
of work with Trouble?

10:20.403 --> 10:24.006
Well, Georgie's roman riding
in the rodeo this weekend.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.442
And she's got her heart
set on adding a jump.

10:26.476 --> 10:28.310
Wow!

10:28.345 --> 10:30.779
Well, doesn't look like Trouble
shares that desire.

10:30.814 --> 10:33.716
No. I don't think
he really gets the cavaletti.

10:33.750 --> 10:37.553
I'm gonna bring Phoenix in
to show him how it's done.

10:37.587 --> 10:40.789
Hey, um, how did your talk go
with Scott?

10:41.465 --> 10:44.426
Well, You're not gonna
believe this...

10:44.461 --> 10:45.761
he asked me to be his partner.

10:45.795 --> 10:48.597
What? Like... are you serious?

10:48.632 --> 10:50.933
- Yes!
- Ty, that's amazing!

10:50.967 --> 10:53.269
I know. It's crazy, huh?

10:53.303 --> 10:55.273
Ty!

10:55.739 --> 10:59.441
Could use a hand here,
in your loft.

10:59.476 --> 11:02.390
All right. I'm comin'.

11:03.309 --> 11:07.156
Apparently I don't have time
to celebrate with you so...

11:07.826 --> 11:10.060
Our home awaits!

11:11.325 --> 11:13.012
Hey Ty!

11:13.521 --> 11:16.015
I am so proud of you.

11:28.772 --> 11:31.974
Seven times six has the flu,
it has a fever of...

11:32.008 --> 11:34.276
Forty two.

11:34.311 --> 11:35.611
Seven times seven is really
fine, looking great for...

11:35.645 --> 11:37.880
- Forty nine...
- Seven times eight...

11:37.914 --> 11:40.950
Lou! This is stupid.
My quiz is on slopes.

11:40.984 --> 11:44.620
Yeah. Which is why you need to know your
times tables forwards and backwards.

11:44.654 --> 11:46.956
Georgie, it is the basis
for everything,

11:46.990 --> 11:49.458
and I don't think you ever
really memorized them properly.

11:49.492 --> 11:52.595
Well, why can't my teacher
just let us use a calculators.

11:52.629 --> 11:56.311
Because you cannot rely on a
device to do the work for you.

11:56.331 --> 11:59.702
Why not? We all have
calculators on our phones,

11:59.736 --> 12:01.837
in our pockets,
like all the time.

12:01.871 --> 12:03.606
And don't tell me you don't
use yours.

12:03.640 --> 12:07.643
I've seen you at Maggie's when you
do your banking and cost reports.

12:07.677 --> 12:10.779
Maybe it's time for a short break.

12:10.814 --> 12:13.382
But only fifteen minutes, okay?

12:13.416 --> 12:16.018
- Okay?
- Yep!

12:22.959 --> 12:25.928
Well, you ditch that study
session pretty quickly.

12:25.962 --> 12:28.631
The math warden has given me
some time in the yard.

12:28.665 --> 12:31.000
So... let's get on with it.

12:31.034 --> 12:35.371
Okay, let's show Trouble
how it's done.

13:03.173 --> 13:05.977
He did it! Good boy.

13:18.081 --> 13:19.314
Good boy!

13:21.518 --> 13:23.552
See. I told you they could
do this.

13:23.586 --> 13:25.487
Yes, I have to admit,
they're picking it up

13:25.522 --> 13:27.322
a lot faster than I expected.

13:27.357 --> 13:28.957
But we're still not there yet.

13:28.992 --> 13:31.860
Georgie! I said fifteen minutes.

13:33.196 --> 13:36.298
Hey, hey!
Who's ready for some barbecue?

13:39.602 --> 13:41.421
Oh, sorry, am I too early
to picking her up?

13:41.441 --> 13:44.146
No, your timing is perfect.

13:44.708 --> 13:46.975
All right!

13:47.410 --> 13:49.445
All I'm saying is if I had
failed a test at Georgie's age,

13:49.479 --> 13:52.648
I would have done whatever it took
to make sure it didn't happen again.

13:52.682 --> 13:54.416
I did fail a test at her age.

13:54.451 --> 13:57.419
And I would have done anything to get
out of one of your study sessions.

13:57.454 --> 14:01.323
Do you remember that stupid rhyming
game you use to make me do?

14:01.357 --> 14:02.925
It's not stupid, it works.

14:02.959 --> 14:06.395
Oh no... you are so not making
Georgie do it, are you?

14:06.429 --> 14:07.763
It works!

14:07.797 --> 14:09.765
Ow!

14:09.799 --> 14:12.000
Um, dad, do you want help
with your coat?

14:12.035 --> 14:13.635
No. I got it.

14:13.670 --> 14:15.607
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:15.627 --> 14:18.672
Listen, I want everybody to stop
making a fuss about my shoulder...

14:18.692 --> 14:20.709
Well, it's kinda tough with
you bellyaching all the time.

14:20.744 --> 14:23.579
Well, you're the one that talked
me into getting the surgery

14:23.613 --> 14:26.849
and now it hurts more
than it did before.

14:26.883 --> 14:29.098
I need your help
at the school tomorrow.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.987
Well, only because you asked
so nicely.

14:32.021 --> 14:34.723
Well, I gotta get my kids
ready for Casey's rodeo.

14:34.757 --> 14:37.793
Yeah. I heard she's naming that
rodeo after her late husband.

14:37.827 --> 14:39.361
Yeah, she is.

14:39.395 --> 14:41.763
So, um, everyone.

14:41.798 --> 14:44.760
Ty has some good news.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.903
Scott has asked him to be
partner at the clinic.

14:47.937 --> 14:49.337
- No!
- What?

14:49.372 --> 14:51.673
Good for you, man!
Congratulations!

14:51.707 --> 14:53.141
Thank you!

14:53.176 --> 14:54.876
Amy, looks like you picked
a winner after all. Huh?

14:54.911 --> 14:57.479
That's so amazing. But wow...

14:57.513 --> 15:00.082
I mean, big changes ahead
for you guys.

15:00.116 --> 15:01.983
Yeah, it's be a bit more
responsibility for sure.

15:02.018 --> 15:04.286
A bit? More like all-consuming.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.289
What happened to you guys
working together? Is that...

15:07.323 --> 15:10.405
- Well...
- That's the... that's still our plan.

15:10.425 --> 15:11.860
Seriously?

15:11.894 --> 15:14.563
Oh, the little sign out there
on the barn?

15:14.597 --> 15:17.732
Yeah, I know, I love the
"dream", but think about it...

15:17.767 --> 15:20.335
more of a "pipe" dream, right?
This is a real job though.

15:20.369 --> 15:22.170
Okay, all right.

15:22.205 --> 15:26.007
What we should be doing here
is sharing a toast.

15:26.042 --> 15:30.893
So, here's to you, Dr. Borden...
Partner.

15:30.913 --> 15:32.280
Cheers.

15:32.315 --> 15:34.649
- Cheers. Thank you.
- Cheers, dad.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.551
Cheers.

15:39.222 --> 15:41.022
So you excited to come
to Vancouver this summer?

15:41.057 --> 15:42.757
I want to see the dolphins!

15:42.792 --> 15:46.061
Yeah, we're gonna see
dolphins at the aquarium...

15:46.095 --> 15:47.963
we're gonna go to the beach,

15:47.997 --> 15:49.331
we're gonna go to Whistler
for a weekend...

15:49.365 --> 15:51.867
I have a whole month of
activities all planned out.

15:51.901 --> 15:53.502
What do you think? Sound good?

15:53.536 --> 15:57.272
Well, if I go will I be able
to practice my riding?

15:57.306 --> 16:00.675
I don't want to get kicked off
the extreme team.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.577
Uh... I don't know. Yeah.

16:02.612 --> 16:05.147
There's probably some places
to rent horses outside the city.

16:05.181 --> 16:07.682
I don't know if you can do your
crazy tricks on them though.

16:11.986 --> 16:13.555
How is school going?

16:13.589 --> 16:16.124
Mom said she's helping you study
for some kind of re-test?

16:16.159 --> 16:18.960
I thought tutoring was supposed
to make math less confusing.

16:18.995 --> 16:21.897
Just give her a chance, Georgie?

16:23.304 --> 16:26.635
Unless... wait, you're good
at math...

16:26.669 --> 16:28.036
Oh...

16:28.070 --> 16:30.105
Your mom knows what she's doing.
C'mon.

16:30.139 --> 16:33.074
Yeah, but something tells me
you'd be better.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.216
Hi. How was dinner?

16:41.250 --> 16:43.552
- Awesome!
- Oh great!

16:43.586 --> 16:45.620
It was good...

16:47.123 --> 16:48.857
We'll go fishing tomorrow, okay?

16:48.891 --> 16:52.060
Yeah, maybe.
If I get a study break.

16:54.797 --> 16:57.566
- G'night, daddy.
- Good night.

17:01.430 --> 17:03.972
So, you guys have fun?

17:04.582 --> 17:06.840
Yeah, yeah of course, um...

17:06.876 --> 17:08.276
Georgie seems a little off
though...

17:08.310 --> 17:09.544
Oh really.

17:09.579 --> 17:13.714
I don't know if it's the
coming to Vancouver thing or...

17:14.040 --> 17:15.884
or the whole math issue?

17:15.917 --> 17:20.188
Yeah, our study session
didn't go very well...

17:20.223 --> 17:22.790
She's um-she's really
struggling.

17:22.825 --> 17:24.251
Hm.

17:25.554 --> 17:30.065
You know... do you think we're
making too big a deal of all this?

17:30.555 --> 17:32.834
By "we", do you mean me?

17:32.868 --> 17:34.603
No, no. Not at all.
I didn't say that.

17:34.637 --> 17:36.905
You know what. Her marks have
been slipping all year, Peter.

17:36.939 --> 17:40.008
And I think that's something that we
should both be very concerned about that.

17:40.042 --> 17:43.678
Absolutely. I... totally. Um...

17:43.713 --> 17:46.081
That's why I was thinking, uh...

17:46.115 --> 17:48.049
You know, maybe I should
take a crack at it?

17:48.084 --> 17:49.684
- At what?
- The tutoring.

17:49.719 --> 17:51.820
I mean it can't hurt, right?

17:51.854 --> 17:53.321
Is that coming from Georgie?

17:53.356 --> 17:55.523
No... No. Not at all.

17:55.558 --> 17:57.225
It just, you know, you have
to deal with this

17:59.862 --> 18:02.063
- and I feel like I should...
- So you think you can do better?

18:02.098 --> 18:04.899
It's not a competition, Lou.
That's not what I'm saying.

18:04.934 --> 18:06.334
Okay, you know what,
you're right.

18:06.369 --> 18:08.069
Um, I'm sorry.

18:08.104 --> 18:11.873
Maybe a change of pace
would help.

18:12.210 --> 18:13.775
- Okay. Good.
- Okay.

18:14.009 --> 18:16.010
I'll pick her up tomorrow.

18:16.045 --> 18:18.213
- Oh okay.
- Tomorrow morning.

18:18.247 --> 18:20.557
- Okay. Good night.
- Good night.

18:30.459 --> 18:33.261
Did you get any sleep last
night?

18:35.664 --> 18:37.732
Sorry about that,
I got lots on my mind.

18:37.766 --> 18:41.970
Hey, you are gonna do great
with Scott.

18:42.004 --> 18:46.140
Well, I haven't actually
accepted the partnership...

18:50.079 --> 18:51.379
I would have on the spot,

18:51.413 --> 18:54.215
but he asked me to think
about it.

18:54.250 --> 18:59.048
Okay, ah, do you want to talk
about it?

18:59.889 --> 19:03.858
Yes. But I got a bunch of field calls
I gotta get to right now so...

19:03.893 --> 19:05.960
- Later, okay?
- Okay.

19:05.995 --> 19:07.428
Love you.

19:14.803 --> 19:16.738
What are you doing here, Jack?

19:16.772 --> 19:21.109
I wanted to get a sneak peak
at Tim's hot shot student

19:21.143 --> 19:24.412
before she rides in her first
rodeo.

19:26.649 --> 19:28.316
Where you ready for your first
rodeo, Jack?

19:28.350 --> 19:30.818
- No, sir.
- Me neither.

19:30.853 --> 19:33.154
I guess I forgot there's only
way to become a bronc rider

19:33.188 --> 19:35.823
was to do it for real.

19:43.866 --> 19:46.935
All right. Remember to get
a good spur out. All right?

19:46.969 --> 19:48.796
Set your feet.

19:50.072 --> 19:51.924
That's it.

19:53.542 --> 19:55.176
Okay.

19:55.210 --> 19:57.111
What in the hell
is going on here!

19:57.146 --> 20:00.415
Mom?

20:04.332 --> 20:05.722
I come out here to check on your shoulder

20:05.768 --> 20:08.370
I find my daughter getting
onto a bucking bronco?

20:08.404 --> 20:11.606
Tim's been taking it real slow
with Jade over the past few months...

20:11.641 --> 20:13.141
Months? What?

20:13.175 --> 20:14.634
You didn't know about this?

20:14.654 --> 20:17.379
My dad signed your school's
release form.

20:17.413 --> 20:19.781
Yeah. Well, I'll be having
a chat with him about that.

20:19.815 --> 20:22.121
See. This is why I didn't tell you.
I knew you'd overreact.

20:22.141 --> 20:26.254
Do you know how many kids come through
the E.R. because of this stupid "sport"?

20:26.289 --> 20:28.890
Come on, we're going home.

20:28.925 --> 20:30.391
I have my own truck, mom.

20:30.411 --> 20:31.805
I'm not your little girl
any more.

20:31.825 --> 20:35.363
Does that mean you're ready to start
making the payments on it yourself?

20:35.398 --> 20:36.881
Ah-ha.

20:36.899 --> 20:40.769
She doesn't go near one of those
broncs, you hear me?

20:43.005 --> 20:44.840
Whatever, it's not her choice.

20:44.874 --> 20:48.543
Actually, it is.
You're seventeen.

20:48.578 --> 20:49.911
It's my birthday's next week.

20:49.946 --> 20:51.913
Yeah, well until then
you're a minor

20:51.948 --> 20:53.882
and you can't sign that form
on your own.

20:53.916 --> 20:57.320
And I don't think your dad is gonna
do it for you this time, is he?

20:58.121 --> 20:59.755
Get off.

21:02.492 --> 21:05.527
Okay, I think they're ready for
this, but just be careful, okay?

21:05.561 --> 21:06.962
Don't worry. I've got this.

21:06.996 --> 21:09.765
If anything feels wrong
at all, just don't do the jump.

21:09.799 --> 21:11.366
C'mon, Amy. The only way
we're ever gonna know

21:11.400 --> 21:13.635
if they can do this
is just to go for it.

21:13.669 --> 21:15.403
That's it! Stay close!

21:17.440 --> 21:18.874
Whoa. Whoa!

21:32.655 --> 21:35.184
That's it, Georgie!
You keep them together.

21:40.630 --> 21:43.398
Whoa!

21:43.432 --> 21:45.100
Agh!

21:46.569 --> 21:49.704
Georgie!

21:49.739 --> 21:51.439
I'm all right. I'm all right!

21:51.474 --> 21:52.941
Yeah. Well, this is way too
dangerous, okay?

21:52.975 --> 21:55.076
You could have got caught up
in the straps.

21:55.111 --> 21:57.445
No. Trouble's totally new
at this.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.915
I just-I need to find a way
to cue them both over the jump

21:59.949 --> 22:02.150
so he's in time with Phoenix.

22:02.185 --> 22:05.053
Hey! You okay?

22:05.087 --> 22:07.055
Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right.

22:07.089 --> 22:08.690
How's the new routine
coming along?

22:08.724 --> 22:10.025
Uh, we're just in the middle
of it.

22:10.059 --> 22:11.660
Is it okay if we go fishing
later?

22:11.694 --> 22:13.061
Sorry, sweetie.
We gotta get going now.

22:13.095 --> 22:14.896
And we're not going
to the river.

22:14.931 --> 22:16.665
I talked to your mom
and we decided

22:16.699 --> 22:18.533
I'm gonna help you study
for that re-test.

22:18.568 --> 22:20.035
- But...!
- No, it's okay.

22:20.069 --> 22:21.570
I need to do work with these
guys some more

22:21.604 --> 22:23.664
before you try it again.

22:25.041 --> 22:26.408
Okay.

22:27.977 --> 22:29.778
Go on.

22:31.480 --> 22:34.495
Good! Yeah!

22:35.785 --> 22:38.420
- Sign looks good, guys.
- Thanks, Casey!

22:40.556 --> 22:42.891
Oh, good grief!
You want to talk to him, Jack?

22:42.925 --> 22:44.192
Tell him to take something
for the pain?

22:44.227 --> 22:45.861
Not really.

22:45.895 --> 22:47.596
Not now, Casey.
I'm not in the mood.

22:47.630 --> 22:49.664
Yeah, because you're in pain.

22:49.699 --> 22:52.868
I gotta take this,
it's my radio interview.

22:53.751 --> 22:56.805
Hey Norm. Yeah.
Thanks for having me on...

22:56.839 --> 22:59.975
Yeah, we decide it to call it "Hank
the tank rodeo for the cure",

23:00.009 --> 23:02.477
In honor of my late husband.

23:02.511 --> 23:04.479
He was one of those guys
that was so bloody tough,

23:04.513 --> 23:06.381
even in the face of cancer.

23:06.415 --> 23:09.351
You know this rodeo will embody
his courageous spirit...

23:14.935 --> 23:18.422
- Ta da!
- What?

23:22.765 --> 23:25.333
You got your mother to sign
this form?

23:25.368 --> 23:27.783
How do I know
you didn't forge this?

23:28.116 --> 23:30.405
You wanna call her?

23:30.439 --> 23:32.073
What? You don't think I will?

23:32.108 --> 23:35.143
That's her number,
just hit call.

23:42.135 --> 23:44.586
Uh, Trish. It's Tim Fleming.

23:44.620 --> 23:49.658
And I'm staring at your daughters
entry form that you signed.

23:49.692 --> 23:52.761
I don't know why you changed
your mind, but it's fantastic.

23:52.795 --> 23:55.030
So if you have any questions
about the rodeo...

23:56.261 --> 23:59.190
give me a call. Bye.

24:00.770 --> 24:03.038
How did you get her
to change her mind.

24:03.072 --> 24:05.106
Let's just say it took
a lot of begging,

24:05.141 --> 24:08.109
and a little emotional blackmail
thrown in for good measure.

24:08.144 --> 24:10.879
Well, I tell you, y-you show
that kind of tenacity tomorrow,

24:10.913 --> 24:13.782
you just might win this thing.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.652
It's not exactly a marathon
study session, now was it?

24:17.687 --> 24:19.988
Nope. Didn't need it.
Aced the practice quiz.

24:20.022 --> 24:22.824
Guess I finally found
the right tutor.

24:22.858 --> 24:24.791
Don't even try with that.

24:24.811 --> 24:27.629
We're going back at it and I expect
an even better mark next time.

24:27.663 --> 24:30.332
Now this ground rail should
cue Trouble to jump earlier.

24:30.366 --> 24:32.534
It worked when I tried
with him on his own.

24:32.568 --> 24:33.931
That's great.

24:33.951 --> 24:36.538
We'll see, I'm still nervous
about them doing this together.

24:36.572 --> 24:38.883
It's trick riding.
We're supposed to be nervous.

24:41.711 --> 24:43.812
That's it! Good boy, Trouble!

25:12.908 --> 25:14.909
Hey, you almost had it there.

25:15.344 --> 25:17.378
Almost doesn't count.

25:17.413 --> 25:20.248
Hey, what's going on here.

25:20.282 --> 25:22.016
Hey! You gotta check this out!

25:22.050 --> 25:24.218
Georgie is about to nail
this jump.

25:24.253 --> 25:26.454
Cool. I mean, the very fact
that you're out here

25:26.488 --> 25:28.923
must mean that you got all
your math work done.

25:28.957 --> 25:30.324
Yeah, we just flew right
into it.

25:30.359 --> 25:32.393
She beat her test score by 20%.

25:32.428 --> 25:33.728
Really?

25:33.762 --> 25:35.863
Yeah, Her fingers were moving
so fast on that calculator

25:35.898 --> 25:38.199
I could barley keep up.

25:38.233 --> 25:39.901
You let her use the calculator?

25:39.935 --> 25:41.736
Yeah. Why?

25:41.770 --> 25:44.372
You let him let you
use a calculator?

25:44.406 --> 25:46.340
Whoa! Wait wait. What the
problem with using a calculator?

25:46.375 --> 25:48.342
They're not allowed.

25:48.377 --> 25:50.244
What are you gonna do when
your teacher asks you

25:50.279 --> 25:51.612
to put it away for the test?

25:51.647 --> 25:52.785
- Sorry, but...
- No, no, no, no...

25:52.805 --> 25:56.150
You know what Georgie, this behavior
is completely unacceptable.

25:56.185 --> 25:57.952
You think you can play us
like that?

25:57.986 --> 25:59.320
Think again.

25:59.354 --> 26:01.122
You can forget about the rodeo.

26:06.019 --> 26:07.608
Look I get it I screwed up

26:07.609 --> 26:10.192
so lock me in my room
or ground me for a week,

26:10.227 --> 26:11.794
just you have to let me ride.

26:11.828 --> 26:15.197
Georgie, stop begging!
I've made up my mind.

26:15.232 --> 26:18.147
Listen, she's been working
really hard for this.

26:18.395 --> 26:23.121
Look Georgie, your dad and I
need to discuss this... alone.

26:28.178 --> 26:29.845
There has to be consequences...

26:29.879 --> 26:32.448
I know. And I'm not saying
we should let this slide.

26:32.482 --> 26:35.384
Okay? She's been through a lot.

26:35.418 --> 26:36.752
Yeah. I know.

26:36.786 --> 26:38.354
And we feel bad about that.

26:38.388 --> 26:40.756
But that doesn't mean that
we can let her manipulate us.

26:40.790 --> 26:44.460
Peter, we have to-we have
to be together on this.

26:45.061 --> 26:47.339
We have to be on the same
page here.

26:49.132 --> 26:51.267
I just think you should
reconsider the rodeo.

26:51.301 --> 26:52.740
That's all.

27:01.144 --> 27:04.803
Wow. Buddy sure looks better
than when he first got here.

27:09.886 --> 27:13.689
Georgie, I might have
over-reacted a little bit...

27:19.696 --> 27:23.065
You know that what you did
was wrong.

27:23.099 --> 27:24.933
Peter and I are both working
really hard

27:24.968 --> 27:26.835
to do what best for you.

27:28.189 --> 27:32.341
We know that this isn't ideal,
but this is our new reality.

27:32.375 --> 27:36.459
And the only way it's gonna work is if
we're all honest with each another.

27:36.946 --> 27:38.705
I hate math.

27:39.916 --> 27:41.517
Well, that's a start.

27:41.551 --> 27:42.785
Of course I'd rather be
trick riding,

27:42.819 --> 27:45.154
at least it makes sense to me.

27:45.188 --> 27:48.424
Well, that's because you don't
skip out on the hard work.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.081
I mean, the first time you tried
roman riding

27:50.101 --> 27:53.762
I'm sure it felt impossible.
Look at you now.

27:53.797 --> 27:55.631
Who cares. No one's going
to see it.

27:55.665 --> 27:58.300
Okay, lose the attitude,
Georgie.

27:58.335 --> 28:00.803
Let's both be reasonable here.

28:02.238 --> 28:03.706
Here's a proposal...

28:03.740 --> 28:06.642
and I have to run this
by your dad first...

28:06.676 --> 28:09.445
If you promise me that the
minute the rodeo's over

28:09.479 --> 28:12.781
we'll lock ourselves in your
room to study...

28:12.816 --> 28:15.351
I let you ride.

28:15.385 --> 28:17.519
Kinda late for that.

28:17.554 --> 28:19.154
I only had a little time
to practice my jump,

28:19.189 --> 28:20.689
and now it's gone.

28:20.724 --> 28:22.491
I'll have to stick
to roman riding.

28:22.525 --> 28:24.560
I'm bending over backwards
for you here.

28:24.594 --> 28:26.695
Do we have a deal or not?

28:28.298 --> 28:30.065
Fine.

28:30.100 --> 28:33.068
You know, it's too bad
you don't get to do that jump,

28:33.103 --> 28:34.636
but if you had been truthful
with us in the first place,

28:34.671 --> 28:37.072
none of this would have
happened.

28:46.049 --> 28:48.517
I need someone in the chutes
tomorrow.

28:48.551 --> 28:50.619
Why is it that every time
you're short-handed

28:50.653 --> 28:52.554
you assume that I'm gonna bail
you out...

28:52.589 --> 28:54.156
Can you help me or not?

28:54.190 --> 28:55.657
Yeah... I'm in.

28:55.692 --> 28:58.527
You've been such a treat to hang
out with lately, why not?

28:58.561 --> 29:00.629
Don't start on me
about my shoulder please.

29:00.663 --> 29:04.366
We both know that's not
the only thing gnawing at you.

29:04.401 --> 29:05.768
I don't know what
you're talking about?

29:05.802 --> 29:08.237
Yes you do.

29:08.271 --> 29:12.875
I know you wanna be okay with Casey
naming the rodeo after Hank...

29:12.909 --> 29:14.843
but you're not.

29:14.878 --> 29:18.814
I mean, it can't be easy hearing
about how courageous Hank was

29:18.848 --> 29:21.183
while you're moping around
with a bum shoulder...

29:21.217 --> 29:22.440
Fine. Thanks. That's enough...

29:22.460 --> 29:25.554
And I know Casey's been getting
on you to take pain meds.

29:25.588 --> 29:29.358
How come you haven't told her
why you can't?

29:30.072 --> 29:33.495
Nothing good comes from measuring
yourself up against a ghost.

29:33.530 --> 29:36.298
- I'm just sayin'...
- I'll see you tomorrow.

29:46.609 --> 29:49.478
- All right, I'll see you later, Okay?
- Bye.

29:49.512 --> 29:53.158
- Are you talking to Scott today?
- Yeah.

29:54.287 --> 29:57.319
You're going to take it, right?

30:00.604 --> 30:02.403
What about us, Amy?

30:02.880 --> 30:05.194
I'll be too busy to help
grow our business.

30:07.012 --> 30:10.265
I knew you were worried
about that...

30:11.777 --> 30:14.336
Don't think I haven't
thought about it too.

30:14.370 --> 30:17.673
This is something we've wanted
to do for a long time...

30:17.707 --> 30:21.743
But, Ty being a partner
at the clinic

30:21.778 --> 30:25.414
that's only gonna bring us
that much closer to our dream.

30:25.448 --> 30:27.683
Think of all the things
that you'll learn.

30:27.717 --> 30:30.619
And how much time
it'll take to learn them.

30:30.936 --> 30:34.857
Amy, I've spent a lifetime watching
people screw up their priorities.

30:35.183 --> 30:38.794
Our marriage is the most
important thing in my life.

30:39.067 --> 30:42.464
It's this partnership
that I care about.

30:42.499 --> 30:44.366
I'm not gonna let anything
jeopardize that.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.168
It won't.

30:52.777 --> 30:55.310
Thanks for letting me
do the rodeo.

30:55.345 --> 30:57.379
Sounded like a fair deal.

30:57.413 --> 30:58.747
I'm not gonna do the jump
anymore,

30:58.781 --> 31:01.550
but I'd like if you could
still come and watch.

31:01.584 --> 31:04.620
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

31:04.654 --> 31:06.522
I'm sorry about
the calculator thing.

31:06.556 --> 31:08.557
What's done is done. Okay?

31:08.591 --> 31:10.526
Yeah, but there's something
else...

31:10.560 --> 31:13.562
You know how Lou was, you know,
putting up such a fight

31:13.596 --> 31:15.797
about us going to Vancouver?

31:15.832 --> 31:17.833
I thought you should know
that...

31:18.476 --> 31:21.670
Lou wasn't exactly happy
with the idea but...

31:21.988 --> 31:24.706
it was the one who really
didn't want to go.

31:26.242 --> 31:29.778
I love spending time with you,
but this is my home...

31:29.812 --> 31:33.515
I have extreme team bookings...
all summer.

31:33.820 --> 31:37.286
I made a commitment
and now I have to break it.

31:39.355 --> 31:40.822
I'm sorry.

31:40.857 --> 31:42.524
I should go.

31:42.559 --> 31:44.941
I have to get go ready
for the rodeo.

31:45.461 --> 31:47.896
Okay. I'll see you there.

32:18.528 --> 32:21.029
Okay, They just posted the draw.

32:21.064 --> 32:22.598
You're riding a horse named
Diesel.

32:22.632 --> 32:24.967
And don't worry, he sounds
a lot tougher than he is.

32:25.001 --> 32:27.169
'Cause I know the horse and you
can totally handle this guy.

32:27.203 --> 32:29.571
Just hope he kicks up enough
of a fuss for you to score well.

32:29.606 --> 32:30.939
What number is she wearing?

32:30.974 --> 32:32.774
- Lucky number 22.
- Great number.

32:32.809 --> 32:34.776
Well, you're already creating
quite a buzz.

32:34.811 --> 32:37.994
Everyone's talking about the
brand new female bronc rider.

32:38.014 --> 32:39.481
Oh yeah. She's gonna do great.

32:39.515 --> 32:40.949
Diesel doesn't stand a chance.

32:40.983 --> 32:43.084
Actually, Diesel got pulled
because of injury.

32:43.119 --> 32:45.887
So you're riding the substitute
horse, Whiplash.

32:45.922 --> 32:47.889
Whoa, whoa, we know that name.

32:47.924 --> 32:50.425
That's a pro rodeo horse.

32:50.459 --> 32:52.060
- Cool...
- No.

32:52.094 --> 32:53.461
Well, he's been underperforming.

32:53.496 --> 32:55.997
So the contractor's sent him
back down to the minors.

32:56.032 --> 32:58.667
Whoa. So Whiplash
can get his mojo back?

32:58.701 --> 33:02.704
Casey, she's not ready for a horse
like that if he's on his game.

33:02.738 --> 33:04.606
- No, we're out!
- Says who?

33:04.640 --> 33:06.408
- We're out.
- No. You can't do that.

33:06.442 --> 33:08.343
- Yeah, I can do that.
- I think you're overreacting.

33:08.377 --> 33:09.608
I'm not overreacting...

33:09.628 --> 33:13.547
C'mon, Tim. How tough can he be
if he's bucking in the amateurs?

33:13.567 --> 33:15.050
I can do this.

33:19.055 --> 33:21.556
You're getting to be a real
pain in the butt, you know that?

33:24.493 --> 33:26.661
All right.
We're about to start...

33:26.696 --> 33:31.666
Welcome Hudson, to the first
annual "Hank the tank rodeo for the cure!"

33:31.701 --> 33:35.537
It's my honor to introduce the lady
who put this whole thing together;

33:35.571 --> 33:38.173
Casey McMurtry.

33:42.979 --> 33:46.014
I want to thank you all
for coming out today

33:46.048 --> 33:49.985
helping support this fight
against cancer.

33:50.019 --> 33:53.769
It's a disease that's
effected probably all of us

33:53.789 --> 33:55.724
in one way or another.

33:58.262 --> 34:00.896
Hank "the tank" was my
husband...

34:01.501 --> 34:03.298
He was a really great man...

34:05.268 --> 34:09.237
He was... the kind of man...

34:11.456 --> 34:13.842
He was the kind of man who...

34:15.478 --> 34:17.045
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:19.984 --> 34:24.252
Hank McMurtry was the kind of guy
that wasn't afraid of anything.

34:24.954 --> 34:28.590
What was it he used
to say about cancer?

34:28.623 --> 34:31.059
That it was like
a nasty ol' bronc?

34:33.963 --> 34:38.384
He said that, he was pretty sure
it could toss him at any time,

34:38.719 --> 34:41.014
but damn if he was gonna
try and ride it out.

34:42.405 --> 34:44.706
And it's that same spirit
that these cowboys and cowgirls

34:44.739 --> 34:46.341
are gonna be ridding with today.

34:46.375 --> 34:51.146
So buckle yourselves in, it's
gonna be one heck of a ride!

35:04.760 --> 35:06.428
Listen, it's not too late
to turn out.

35:06.462 --> 35:07.896
No, I'm doing this.

35:07.930 --> 35:10.899
Listen to me, Jade.
Hey! Listen to me.

35:10.933 --> 35:13.631
Okay. You find yourself getting
in trouble you double grab.

35:13.651 --> 35:16.133
- I'll be disqualified.
- I don't care.

35:16.153 --> 35:19.374
Okay. If this horse starts to act like he's
got the devil in him, you double grab.

35:22.712 --> 35:24.112
All right.

35:24.146 --> 35:27.482
Your next competitor
is Jade Virani.

35:27.516 --> 35:29.751
That's right, Jade is a she,
and she's drawn Whiplash.

35:29.785 --> 35:31.820
- Jade! Go!
- Whooo!

35:43.366 --> 35:45.000
Double grab!

35:45.034 --> 35:46.301
Double grab!

35:46.335 --> 35:48.136
Oh!

35:48.170 --> 35:50.939
Oh!

35:50.973 --> 35:52.807
Oh my...

35:52.842 --> 35:56.678
Oh geez... I never get
used to seeing that kind of wreck.

35:56.712 --> 35:58.947
C'mon, Jade.
Show us you're all right...

35:58.981 --> 36:00.849
- You okay?
- Aghh!

36:07.659 --> 36:09.235
Excuse me!

36:10.917 --> 36:12.551
Ow! It really hurts.

36:12.585 --> 36:13.919
You're gonna be okay.

36:13.953 --> 36:15.387
I'll go with her.

36:15.421 --> 36:16.888
You still have a couple of
students to ride yet.

36:16.923 --> 36:18.032
I'll go with her.

36:18.052 --> 36:21.059
All right, you and I'll call her
mother and tell her what happened.

36:21.094 --> 36:22.894
No. I'll call her
from the hospital.

36:22.929 --> 36:24.696
I'm going with you too.

36:24.731 --> 36:25.868
Oh no you're not!

36:25.888 --> 36:27.419
I don't care about my ride.

36:27.439 --> 36:30.168
- Come here!
- Ow!

36:30.203 --> 36:32.526
Just kick some butt, okay?

36:32.546 --> 36:34.473
Blow their minds, kid.

36:39.016 --> 36:41.246
You talk it over
with the family?

36:41.280 --> 36:45.050
I did. Lots of opinions
to consider.

36:45.084 --> 36:46.852
Nothing wrong with that.

36:46.886 --> 36:48.355
But at the end of the day,

36:48.375 --> 36:51.123
the only one that really counts
is yours.

36:55.061 --> 36:56.710
I wanna do this, Scott,

36:56.730 --> 36:59.097
It's just... Amy and I
have had this plan...

36:59.132 --> 37:01.767
you know of working together...

37:01.801 --> 37:04.736
and I'm just not quite sure how
all of this is gonna affect that.

37:04.771 --> 37:06.938
I get what your risking here.

37:06.973 --> 37:10.496
But what's life without
taking any risks?

37:11.464 --> 37:13.879
You're not gonna hurt
my feelings either way.

37:13.913 --> 37:15.747
I just need to know...

37:15.782 --> 37:18.216
am I adding another name
to the front door?

37:21.888 --> 37:23.255
Where is she?

37:23.289 --> 37:25.757
Jade came out here today,
didn't she?

37:25.792 --> 37:27.859
She-did she call you?

37:30.020 --> 37:31.236
What?

37:31.256 --> 37:34.900
- Uh... there was an accident...
- What!?

37:34.934 --> 37:37.068
It was her ankle.
Just her ankle...

37:37.103 --> 37:38.937
Her ankle? Just her ankle?

37:38.971 --> 37:41.706
I told you to keep her away
from those broncs.

37:41.741 --> 37:42.974
You are not gonna get away
with it.

37:43.009 --> 37:44.576
I will shut your school down.

37:44.610 --> 37:46.845
Wait, a second! Wait! wait!

37:46.879 --> 37:49.047
- You signed the rodeo form.
- No I didn't.

37:49.081 --> 37:50.682
I didn't sign anything.

37:50.716 --> 37:53.051
I called your house to check.

37:53.085 --> 37:54.853
I left a message
on your home phone.

37:56.508 --> 37:58.081
Really?

37:58.991 --> 38:02.164
You didn't consider that Jade
might erase that message?

38:10.069 --> 38:12.504
Look, Georgie is going to do
the jump.

38:12.538 --> 38:13.972
No, she's not, sweetie.

38:14.006 --> 38:15.841
That's for another
rider's routine.

38:15.875 --> 38:18.176
We're all in
for a special treat now, folks.

38:18.211 --> 38:22.647
Put your hands together for
Hudson's very own extreme team!

38:22.682 --> 38:24.583
Yeah!

38:24.617 --> 38:28.787
We're going to start things off
with their youngest rider, introducing...

38:28.821 --> 38:31.223
Georgina Fleming-Morris!

38:32.692 --> 38:34.626
Go, Georgie!

38:43.502 --> 38:45.237
Yeah!

38:54.247 --> 38:56.615
Oh no!

38:56.649 --> 39:00.452
Looks like Georgina is going
to do another lap for us, folks.

39:00.486 --> 39:02.480
What is she doing?

39:07.693 --> 39:09.895
Oh my God...

39:19.839 --> 39:22.474
Wow!

39:22.508 --> 39:24.242
She did it!

39:45.453 --> 39:46.805
Hey.

39:47.153 --> 39:48.878
So? How did she do?

39:48.914 --> 39:51.015
You should have seen her.
I was so proud.

39:51.049 --> 39:52.616
She-She did the jump!

39:52.651 --> 39:54.418
Great!

39:54.452 --> 39:57.187
Sort of the way I feel
about you.

39:57.510 --> 40:00.165
Partner at a clinic?

40:00.302 --> 40:05.029
Ty, how many people do that
right out of vet school?

40:05.063 --> 40:06.597
How did you know I took it?

40:07.986 --> 40:10.882
I guess, I know my husband
pretty well.

40:14.072 --> 40:15.506
Amy...

40:18.410 --> 40:21.612
are you okay that
our dream has to wait?

40:21.894 --> 40:25.583
As far as I'm concerned,
we're already living it.

40:29.414 --> 40:32.289
Come here.

40:36.561 --> 40:37.744
Oh you know what? That's it.

40:37.764 --> 40:39.606
I'm getting her to write you
a prescription right now.

40:39.626 --> 40:40.586
No, no. Casey. Don't. No!

40:40.606 --> 40:43.567
Why do you have to be playing
the tough guy.

40:45.227 --> 40:48.222
I'm not playing tough guy...

40:49.074 --> 40:51.075
I'm far from that.

40:51.109 --> 40:53.695
The reason that I ca...

40:54.379 --> 40:56.080
That I don't take painkillers
is because

40:56.114 --> 40:58.082
I had a serious addiction
to them.

40:58.116 --> 41:00.766
And they pretty much destroyed
my life.

41:03.049 --> 41:04.476
Oh.

41:05.890 --> 41:07.458
And I've been pushing them
on you since your surgery.

41:07.492 --> 41:09.126
Why didn't you say something?

41:09.160 --> 41:10.494
I'm sorry I should have...

41:10.528 --> 41:13.063
talk to you about this
a long time ago.

41:13.098 --> 41:14.398
I'm just not very proud of it.

41:14.432 --> 41:17.434
Why? I mean, you beat it.

41:17.469 --> 41:20.195
That must have taken
incredible courage.

41:21.560 --> 41:23.000
I'm no Hank.

41:30.582 --> 41:33.651
Look, I don't wanna forget
what Hank and I shared...

41:35.424 --> 41:38.019
but you're my guy.

41:38.456 --> 41:39.957
My right here, right now.

41:39.991 --> 41:43.069
And that's where I'm living.
Not in the past.

41:44.062 --> 41:45.700
All right?

41:46.698 --> 41:47.931
Ow!

41:47.966 --> 41:50.467
Oh, just stop it,
you big baby. Kiss me.

41:54.072 --> 41:57.241
Hey! We're supposed to be
cooling down the horses.

41:57.275 --> 41:59.877
So Georgie told me...

41:59.911 --> 42:03.668
that she's the one who doesn't
want to come to Vancouver.

42:06.317 --> 42:08.318
It has nothing to do with you.

42:08.353 --> 42:11.355
I get it. I mean,
this is where she belongs.

42:11.389 --> 42:14.650
With her horses... with you...

42:15.393 --> 42:17.661
This will always be a part
of her life.

42:17.914 --> 42:20.197
This is her life.

42:20.231 --> 42:22.669
And I can't pull her away
from it.

42:24.502 --> 42:27.738
So I'll be the one who comes
to see her and Katie,

42:27.772 --> 42:29.640
every chance I can get.

42:33.478 --> 42:35.979
Are you sure you're okay
with that?

42:36.014 --> 42:38.252
It's not about what I want.

42:38.883 --> 42:42.653
We always said we'd what's best
for the girls, right?

42:42.687 --> 42:45.639
You can't tell me this
isn't where she belongs.

42:50.595 --> 42:51.795
Thank you.

42:55.166 --> 42:57.167
- Yeahhhhh!!
- Hey...

42:57.202 --> 42:58.569
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

42:58.603 --> 43:00.037
That's it!
I'm gonna get you!

43:00.071 --> 43:01.371
- Guys!
- No! No! No! No!

43:01.406 --> 43:03.240
Georgie!

43:05.076 --> 43:07.010
- No!
- Georgie, no!
