00:07.250 --> 00:10.291
-Crossover, crossover, cross...

00:10.333 --> 00:13.250
Ahhh. See that

00:13.291 --> 00:15.750
Come on, come on, come on. Hurry up, hurry up.

00:17.291 --> 00:19.458
Ugh. Nothin' but net.

00:19.500 --> 00:22.417
Come on, come on. Can you get it to me faster?

00:22.458 --> 00:25.542
-We've been watching you miss for half an hour.

00:29.166 --> 00:33.250
: Good! Here we go.  This is so

00:29.166 --> 00:33.250
boring.

00:35.333 --> 00:37.500
And right now you're learning how to shoot a basketball.

00:39.834 --> 00:42.333
Sure, Faith. You have a turn. Let's see you make a free throw.

00:44.333 --> 00:46.792
Here we go. Okay?

00:46.834 --> 00:49.917
That's why you need to watch how it's done properly.

00:49.959 --> 00:51.875
Ugh, sorry Phillip. Where was I?

00:53.166 --> 00:56.625
-I'm tired. -Okay, sit down. Alright,

00:53.166 --> 00:56.625
your turns up.

00:56.667 --> 00:59.166
Come on up, you get a turn to get the ball for me.

01:00.375 --> 01:03.083
Go get that. Okay, alright?

01:03.125 --> 01:05.083
Come on! Bring it to me. Good girl.

01:05.125 --> 01:07.250
Right here, right here, right here. Right here.

01:07.291 --> 01:09.458
Okay, there we go. Go get the ball.

01:09.500 --> 01:13.500
Don't talk back, alright? Come on. Hurry up.

01:13.542 --> 01:16.417
Perfect. Here we go... And whoops!

01:16.458 --> 01:20.458
Okay, see

01:20.500 --> 01:22.959
♪ I'm awesome, no you're not dude, don't lie ♪

01:23.000 --> 01:25.417
♪ I'm awesome, I'm driving around in my mom's ride ♪

01:25.458 --> 01:28.458

01:30.291 --> 01:33.041

01:34.625 --> 01:37.166
-Okay everyone, have a seat.

01:37.208 --> 01:40.417
I am very excited to announce...

01:40.458 --> 01:43.375
The inaugural Teacher of the Month award.

01:45.583 --> 01:47.917
: There you are.

01:47.959 --> 01:50.208
We have no urinal pucks on the third floor.

01:50.250 --> 01:52.458
None! So... : Alright.

01:53.291 --> 01:55.458
: Yeah.

01:55.500 --> 01:58.083
: How come we're here so early? Like this is...

01:58.125 --> 02:00.417
-If you got here on time, Gerry,

02:00.458 --> 02:02.667
you would know that I was actually here to announce

02:02.709 --> 02:05.125
the Teacher of the Month award. That was my idea.

02:05.166 --> 02:07.291
Who is it?

02:07.333 --> 02:09.458
: I'm very pleased to announce our first

02:09.500 --> 02:12.166
Teacher of the month is Mr. Paul Dwyer.

02:12.208 --> 02:14.917
: Come up here and get

02:12.208 --> 02:14.917
your award.

02:14.959 --> 02:17.125
: I wasn't expecting

02:14.959 --> 02:17.125
this.

02:17.166 --> 02:19.625
: So sick of him. -Well deserved!

02:19.667 --> 02:21.834
-For your dedication to our school,

02:21.875 --> 02:24.000
I would like to present to you this plaque.

02:24.041 --> 02:26.041
Yippy. Who cares?

02:26.083 --> 02:29.542
-I would also like to give you fifty dollars to Cow's Tavern.

02:29.583 --> 02:32.000
I love Cow's. : Ohhh.

02:32.041 --> 02:34.417
-You know, as long as the kids are learning something everyday.

02:34.458 --> 02:36.959
That's an award in itself. It's greatly appreciated. Thank you.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.125
: Aww. -I was also really touched by

02:39.166 --> 02:42.500
this video one of our students made for Paul. And so...

02:39.166 --> 02:42.500
Just gonna get that going.

02:42.542 --> 02:44.500
-You know, this is a pity vote for him.

02:42.542 --> 02:44.500
: Hmm?

02:44.542 --> 02:47.375
-'Cause his dog ran away and he got divorced. That's why he's

02:44.542 --> 02:47.375
winning this.

02:47.417 --> 02:50.000
-And his wife was murdered. -So what, people are murdered

02:47.417 --> 02:50.000
all the time.

02:50.041 --> 02:52.208
: That's true. Yeah. -They don't get awards.

02:52.250 --> 02:55.458
: ...Tell you about Mr. Dwyer and how

02:52.250 --> 02:55.458
he's my hero.

02:55.500 --> 02:59.000
Ever since my mom got into her accident, he's helped me with my

02:55.500 --> 02:59.000
homework everyday.

02:59.041 --> 03:02.166
-We all do that, we're teachers. We help kids with homework.

03:02.208 --> 03:04.834
-Shhh.

03:04.875 --> 03:07.500
-Maybe not after school. -It's so much easier when

03:04.875 --> 03:07.500
you're helping me.

03:07.542 --> 03:10.083
: Mr. Dwyer's my hero.

03:10.125 --> 03:12.917
-This is staged. -Shut up Gerry.

03:12.959 --> 03:16.083
-And he's building her a wheelchair ramp so she

03:12.959 --> 03:16.083
can go up and down easier.

03:16.125 --> 03:19.291
: Oh, great.

03:19.333 --> 03:23.000
Well if she's not paralyzed now, she's gonna be when she

03:19.333 --> 03:23.000
collapses off that ramp.

03:23.041 --> 03:26.291
-And Mr. Dwyer even changes my mom's colostomy bag.

03:26.333 --> 03:28.875
: Oh, right.

03:28.917 --> 03:32.125
: Awww. -Now that's inappropriate

03:28.917 --> 03:32.125
touching.

03:34.500 --> 03:37.667
-No, no, no, no, no. That is disgusting.

03:37.709 --> 03:41.959
-Thank you, thank you. I gotta go help a student before class

03:37.709 --> 03:41.959
starts, but thanks a lot.

03:44.083 --> 03:47.917
-Yes I do.

03:49.750 --> 03:53.625
-Hey, that is a nice little collage.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.792
-It's not a collage, Bobbi.

03:55.834 --> 03:57.917
It's a photo installation entitled:

03:57.959 --> 04:00.583
"Ooh Xavier. Ain't she a Beaut?"

04:00.625 --> 04:03.000
-Well, it is very impressive.

04:03.041 --> 04:06.000
I don't seem to see my picture anywhere in there.

04:08.208 --> 04:10.125
-Yeah. Trust me.

04:10.166 --> 04:14.250
My face really pops out at me, so I definitely would see it if

04:10.166 --> 04:14.250
it was there.

04:14.291 --> 04:17.417
: You're right, you're not in there.

04:14.291 --> 04:17.417
: Yeah.

04:20.709 --> 04:22.917
Well I'm sure it's just an oversight, hey Robert?

04:22.959 --> 04:27.000
You'll think of something? Four pictures of the library plant!

04:27.041 --> 04:30.583
Oh here...Nope, that's a plant again, thought that was me.

04:35.709 --> 04:39.000
-I'm not mad at you. -Okay, great chat, Gerry.

04:39.041 --> 04:42.792
-I get why you did not give me Teacher of the Month. I do.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.917
-I understand that if you gave it to me, your husband, it would

04:45.000 --> 04:48.917
be nepolism.

04:48.959 --> 04:50.834
-Nepotism. -I know how to say it.

04:50.875 --> 04:54.000
Now, I understand I didn't get it first month. Fine.

04:54.041 --> 04:58.041
But I assume I'm getting it next month, that's gotta be

04:54.041 --> 04:58.041
happening.

04:58.083 --> 05:02.375
-Okay, the crazy thing about Teacher of the Month award,

04:58.083 --> 05:02.375
Gerry...

05:02.417 --> 05:04.583
Is that you have to earn it.

05:04.625 --> 05:08.125
-Well, you might want to talk to my students, 'cause they

05:04.625 --> 05:08.125
may have a different story.

05:08.166 --> 05:11.458
-Whatever. -A story about a teacher

05:08.166 --> 05:11.458
who is their friend.

05:11.500 --> 05:14.000
-Maybe they'll say that you...

05:14.041 --> 05:17.875
Are easily distracted and you never listen and you're always

05:14.041 --> 05:17.875
late.

05:17.917 --> 05:20.208
Oh my God, Gerry!

05:22.250 --> 05:24.583
You grab an elastic and you do that...Then the person...

05:24.625 --> 05:26.834
: Seriously? -And then you go look, there's

05:24.625 --> 05:26.834
nothing.

05:26.875 --> 05:29.834
-You're not even listening now. -I'm listening. I listen for

05:26.875 --> 05:29.834
gists.

05:29.875 --> 05:31.792
-That's what I do.

05:31.834 --> 05:34.875
I get the gist of something and then my mind starts thinking of

05:31.834 --> 05:34.875
other things.

05:34.917 --> 05:37.750
It's called multitasking and I'm a professional multitasker.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.917
-Everyday's a holiday. -Everyday's a holiday.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.917
Fun thing to say.

05:44.959 --> 05:46.875
Obviously false, technically.

05:46.917 --> 05:49.667
But, I suppose it reflects the rise of pseudo religions.

05:49.709 --> 05:51.875
And their imprint on our social calendar.

05:51.917 --> 05:54.125
: You crack me up.

05:54.166 --> 05:56.959
-Everyday's a holiday.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.959
-Hey Dwyer, quick question... -Everyday's a holiday, bro.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
: Whoo!

06:03.041 --> 06:05.333
-He's really wearing out that phrase.

06:05.375 --> 06:08.083
-Well, when you look like that, it hardly matters what you say.

06:11.417 --> 06:15.208
-Well, everyday's a holiday! -Let me ask you something

06:11.417 --> 06:15.208
little guy.

06:17.250 --> 06:20.542
-Oh great! Well, because everyday's a holiday,

06:17.250 --> 06:20.542
so it's great.

06:27.291 --> 06:29.709
: Don't you dare. -The answer's holiday!

06:29.750 --> 06:31.875
: Holiday. -That's not cool.

06:35.917 --> 06:38.458
: Ahhh, my stickers arrived.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.834
No, ugh, goddamnit, I ordered the frogs.

06:43.917 --> 06:46.166
-Sir, I need a drink. -Just finish your drawing.

06:46.208 --> 06:49.041
-But I'm thirsty! -Just finish your drawing.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.083
-Ahhh, Mrs Mason-Duncan everybody, to visit.

06:54.125 --> 06:56.000
Thank you.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.875
They're better than okay.

07:00.917 --> 07:04.750
Because they are actually drawing a picture of their

07:00.917 --> 07:04.750
hero right now.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.875
And let us see who they drew?

07:10.917 --> 07:14.834
Danika, why don't you come on up and show Miss Mason-Duncan who

07:10.917 --> 07:14.834
you drew?

07:18.125 --> 07:20.834
Danika! Why are you giving me the...

07:20.875 --> 07:23.375
A little small in the hands, but still flattering nonetheless.

07:23.417 --> 07:26.542
-You do have small hands. -Thank you, Danika.

07:26.583 --> 07:28.667
Did anyone else draw me?

07:28.709 --> 07:31.625
Oh my lord! Come on, the whole...?

07:31.667 --> 07:33.959
Class drew me as their hero.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.125
-We all drew you, the instructions were to draw y...

07:36.166 --> 07:38.375
-Thank you, Danika. Get out. -Oh...

07:38.417 --> 07:41.583
-I drew you sleeping in

07:38.417 --> 07:41.583
class, sir.

07:41.625 --> 07:45.250
See the drool? Right there. -I don't have green pants,

07:41.625 --> 07:45.250
so that can't be me.

07:45.291 --> 07:47.667
: It's pretty bang on. -Yeah, I don't have blonde hair,

07:45.291 --> 07:47.667
so....

07:47.709 --> 07:51.709
I do not have the time for this

07:47.709 --> 07:51.709
right now, okay?

07:51.750 --> 07:54.000
I'm dealing with a really serious situation.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.458
: Pregnant: No!

07:57.500 --> 07:59.709
-Thought I had to guess. -Anyway!

07:59.750 --> 08:01.625
There's a lurker that's been spotted in the area.

08:01.667 --> 08:04.750
-Yes! Yeah, I don't have all

08:01.667 --> 08:04.750
of the information yet.

08:04.792 --> 08:09.041
But apparently he's been reported to be lurking around

08:04.792 --> 08:09.041
several schools in the area.

08:09.083 --> 08:13.250
Okay? He's wearing red shoes and a trench coat.

08:13.291 --> 08:15.625
-A lurker. -Yes, so keep an out out.

08:15.667 --> 08:17.792
-If I see him, I'm gonna kill him.

08:17.834 --> 08:21.583
-No, don't kill him. Just call the police.

08:21.625 --> 08:24.375
-One punch.

08:25.917 --> 08:28.375
-So, you're telling me there's a

08:25.917 --> 08:28.375
lurker in our midst.

08:28.417 --> 08:31.125
-Yeah, somewhere around here. -Oof, if I get my hands on that

08:28.417 --> 08:31.125
guy...

08:31.166 --> 08:33.959
The things I would do, let me tell you.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.208
-I'll tell you what I wouldn't do. Violence.

08:36.250 --> 08:40.667
No, violence is not the answer, but I'd give him a stern talking

08:36.250 --> 08:40.667
to and a cold look.

08:40.709 --> 08:42.959
-Well, you don't have to worry 'cause I'm gonna catch him

08:43.000 --> 08:45.625
And I'm gonna eat at Cow's for one year, for free.

08:45.667 --> 08:47.917
-Oooh, you know how to stretch fifty bucks.

08:47.959 --> 08:50.083
-My mom said to give you this note.

08:50.125 --> 08:52.417
-Great, thank you. -She said to make sure

08:50.125 --> 08:52.417
you read it.

08:52.458 --> 08:54.875
Thank you.

08:54.917 --> 08:57.583
Oooh I'm tired of micromanaging these little kids.

08:57.625 --> 09:00.625
-Ah, well...

09:00.667 --> 09:02.583
How you catch fish. Same way.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.709
-Wallet full of cash down at the pet store.

09:05.750 --> 09:07.667
No! Bait.

09:07.709 --> 09:09.875
-Wildfish. Wildfish. -Watch this.

09:13.667 --> 09:15.542
Listen, can you do Mr. D a favour?

09:15.583 --> 09:18.750
I want you to go stand at the very end of the school property,

09:15.583 --> 09:18.750
there.

09:18.792 --> 09:21.000
-Okay. -I want you to look

09:18.792 --> 09:21.000
approachable.

09:21.041 --> 09:24.083
Look pretty, okay? Just run there. There we go.

09:24.125 --> 09:28.000
You wanna catch a lurker? Think like a lurker.

09:28.041 --> 09:30.542
: Bait.

09:30.583 --> 09:32.709
-Smize Trudy, you can do it.

09:32.750 --> 09:35.208
-I know. -Say Xavier spirit.

09:35.250 --> 09:37.792
: But, like, with your

09:35.250 --> 09:37.792
eyes, not your mouth. Awww.

09:37.834 --> 09:40.000
That is positively adorbs.

09:40.041 --> 09:42.291
Alex, get in there big time.

09:42.333 --> 09:45.291
Reppin' for the dudes, huh: Candid.

09:45.333 --> 09:48.041
A little "collage" op?

09:48.083 --> 09:50.709
: Don't mind if I do. Selfie! Here we go.

09:50.750 --> 09:53.417
-You guys are going to love that. It's going to look great

09:50.750 --> 09:53.417
on the wall.

09:53.458 --> 09:55.625
That's it guys, we've got everything we need.

09:55.667 --> 09:57.792
Here we go, selfie!

09:57.834 --> 10:00.750
-Ah grandma, it's not a selfie if someone else takes the

09:57.834 --> 10:00.750
picture.

10:00.792 --> 10:04.709
-Memory card's full Bobbles. I'm sure we'll have another

10:00.792 --> 10:04.709
Bobbertunity.

10:04.750 --> 10:06.750
: See you guys.

10:11.667 --> 10:14.166
-Probably because he can't stand the site of your face.

10:14.208 --> 10:17.083
-Oh yeah, that's it. I broke his heart.

10:17.125 --> 10:19.583
-Yeah, that's what I meant.

10:19.625 --> 10:23.417
-I never even considered how hard it must be to see me

10:19.625 --> 10:23.417
day in, day out.

10:23.458 --> 10:25.834
You know...Well I mean, looking so great.

10:25.875 --> 10:29.291
But it really must take a toll on the man. Poor guy.

10:29.333 --> 10:31.208
Thank you.

10:32.542 --> 10:36.458
-Somebody's full of themselves. -Pft, she's full of something.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.834
-Tiffany!

10:38.875 --> 10:41.166
-Twirl your hair a little bit.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.583
: Look more vulnerable.

10:43.625 --> 10:45.917
-I'm cute and vulnerable.

10:48.458 --> 10:50.875
: Oh boy.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.083
-I like puppies.

10:55.291 --> 10:58.041
Gerry, I'm ashamed. We're using a cute little brunette girl as

10:55.291 --> 10:58.041
bait.

10:58.083 --> 11:00.667
-So, it's 2016 Gerry.

11:00.709 --> 11:04.500
We're projecting our narrow- minded ideas of what lurkers

11:00.709 --> 11:04.500
find appealing onto this guy.

11:04.542 --> 11:07.291
-Oh my God. I am so embarrassed.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.041
I'm on the diversity committee.

11:10.083 --> 11:12.291
-Painting every lurker with the same brush.

11:12.333 --> 11:14.583
-I'm all alone. -This is a nightmare.

11:14.625 --> 11:16.750
-Nobody's with me.

11:16.792 --> 11:18.709
-To be clear, lurking is still definitely wrong.

11:18.750 --> 11:21.458
-Oh! Terrible. That's why we wanna catch him, put him in

11:18.750 --> 11:21.458
prison.

11:21.500 --> 11:24.417
-Two wrongs don't make a right. Lurking is wrong.

11:21.500 --> 11:24.417
-Wow.

11:24.458 --> 11:26.792
-Stereotyping is wrong -Poor guy, we have offended him.

11:26.834 --> 11:30.500
-I bet he's sitting in a van right now watching us through a

11:26.834 --> 11:30.500
tinted window just shaking his

11:30.542 --> 11:34.125
head. Wondering where we went wrong. Wondering if we know that

11:30.542 --> 11:34.125
the 90's ended.

11:34.166 --> 11:36.291
: Or she.

11:36.333 --> 11:38.417
: Could be. -Oh my gosh. Oh that's

11:36.333 --> 11:38.417
a game changer.

11:38.458 --> 11:40.625
: Did it again. Did it again. Wow.

11:40.667 --> 11:43.417
Tiffany! You're gone. You're done.

11:43.458 --> 11:45.750
: Sorry, go on in.

11:45.792 --> 11:49.041
: You're fired. You know, I'm up for chair of

11:45.792 --> 11:49.041
the diversity committee,

11:49.083 --> 11:52.417
but this is the kind of black mark that can ruin a career.

11:57.208 --> 12:00.166
-It's a veritable United Nations of lurker bait.

12:02.458 --> 12:05.291
-'Cause we are the world and they are the children.

12:05.333 --> 12:08.375
If he doesn't go for these, then he's got some real issues.

12:08.417 --> 12:10.583
-That is a perverts buffet right there.

12:10.625 --> 12:12.750
: I don't want to go! : Vamos!

12:12.792 --> 12:16.500
: I don't want to go! I don't wanna go!

12:12.792 --> 12:16.500
: Vamos! Vamos, Faith!

12:16.542 --> 12:18.792
-We don't have all the information yet, but he's

12:16.542 --> 12:18.792
reported to be...

12:18.834 --> 12:22.083
: I didn't bring a lunch today. Forgot my lunch!

12:22.125 --> 12:24.583
:...Coat... : Now I gotta buy

12:22.125 --> 12:24.583
it.

12:24.625 --> 12:26.667
-Got it. -Shoes.

12:26.709 --> 12:28.875
-Coat and shoes.

12:28.917 --> 12:30.875
-Vamonos. -That guy has a coat and shoes.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.458
-That's him, that's the lurker. Hey! Hey you!

12:30.917 --> 12:33.458
: Let go of me!

12:33.500 --> 12:35.875
: Policia! Hey!

12:35.917 --> 12:38.041
: Go Faith! Policia! -Kk. No policia!

12:38.083 --> 12:39.959
: Ahhh, oh yeah, you know what?

12:40.000 --> 12:43.542
-I don't care what you're

12:40.000 --> 12:43.542
saying, I got you.

12:43.583 --> 12:45.542
I got you! Hey!

12:45.583 --> 12:48.542
: You get outta here! Don't come back!

12:48.583 --> 12:50.875
Simon! I did it, I got him. I'm a hero!

12:50.917 --> 12:53.041
-No, I...

12:53.083 --> 12:55.333
: I got 'em! Don't worry Gerry, I got 'em!

12:55.375 --> 12:57.542
: I think I see an H!

12:57.583 --> 13:00.291
: Go get 'em! : I see an H!

12:57.583 --> 13:00.291
Gerry write down H!

13:00.333 --> 13:04.583
-Yeah, so eventually the whole thing just scabbed over and fell

13:00.333 --> 13:04.583
off.

13:04.625 --> 13:08.041
It still worked! Everyday's a holiday, right?

13:08.083 --> 13:10.125
: That's me. -That's great.

13:10.166 --> 13:12.917
-Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt. Look, it's this

13:10.166 --> 13:12.917
"everyday's a holiday" thing.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.500
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

13:15.542 --> 13:17.583
My new mantra. I've been going through a lot of rough patches.

13:17.625 --> 13:20.041
That's been helping me cope with my life.

13:20.083 --> 13:22.291
-Well that...That is amazing Dwyer.

13:22.333 --> 13:24.458
And it has really helped me too.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.291
My therapist gave it to me to help the darkness go away.

13:28.500 --> 13:31.166
I'm going through a tough time right now. I'm struggling.

13:28.500 --> 13:31.166
-Right.

13:31.208 --> 13:33.333
My dog ran away. -Your...

13:33.375 --> 13:36.375
Wife was murdered.

13:36.417 --> 13:38.625
I keep forgetting about that one, but...

13:38.667 --> 13:41.041
-But you understand what

13:38.667 --> 13:41.041
I mean though, right?

13:41.083 --> 13:43.333
-Do I ever. I don't usually like to talk about this.

13:43.375 --> 13:46.750
But, I was once locked in a basement for a month and a half.

13:46.792 --> 13:50.041
: Locked in the

13:46.792 --> 13:50.041
basement, by old Uncle Tommy.

13:52.291 --> 13:55.375
But, ever since this whole new "everyday's a holiday" thing...

13:55.417 --> 13:58.000
I'm sleeping through the night, living my dreams.

13:58.041 --> 14:00.291
Not waking up to my own screams.

14:00.333 --> 14:03.125
-So, you're going to stop saying "everyday's a holiday" though,

14:00.333 --> 14:03.125
right?

14:03.166 --> 14:05.792
-No, I am years of therapy away from that.

14:05.834 --> 14:09.500
: Everyday's a holiday!

14:15.917 --> 14:19.917
-Blonde hair, adorable. Turns out that lurker had pretty

14:15.917 --> 14:19.917
traditional taste after all.

14:19.959 --> 14:23.250
-Oh.

14:25.792 --> 14:27.959
-Thank you. Stop...

14:28.000 --> 14:31.959
I'm not a hero, you can't just throw the word hero around

14:28.000 --> 14:31.959
like that.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.208
But thank you, I just reacted.

14:34.250 --> 14:36.375
I shut my brain off and did my thing.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.291
And that's different for you how?

14:38.333 --> 14:40.458
-Shut up Trudy, I'm a hero right now.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.709
-Gerry, I just heard what happened.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.709
-You're welcome.

14:42.750 --> 14:45.375
-Lurker news travels fast. -It sure does. Hero.

14:45.417 --> 14:48.208
Well, I guess I do listen sometimes, Miss Mason.

14:48.250 --> 14:50.417
Teacher of the Month.

14:50.458 --> 14:54.083
-Well, I can say that you surprised me by doing

14:50.458 --> 14:54.083
something so...

14:54.125 --> 14:56.333
Uncharacteristically impressive?

14:56.375 --> 14:59.166
-Oh, that's a very nice compliment that I will accept.

14:59.208 --> 15:01.625
-I'm sorry for doubting you.

15:03.667 --> 15:06.250
-How you're sorry for doubting

15:03.667 --> 15:06.250
me.

15:06.291 --> 15:08.375
Miss Mason, can you repeat that Miss Mason?

15:08.417 --> 15:11.166
We turn up the words?

15:08.417 --> 15:11.166
-In front of everybody.

15:11.208 --> 15:13.792
-Sorry for doubting you 'cause I didn't hear you say you were

15:11.208 --> 15:13.792
sorry.

15:13.834 --> 15:16.333
And I think everyone should hear you apologize.

15:13.834 --> 15:16.333
-Ese es el hombre!

15:16.375 --> 15:19.709
-Oh, it's the lurker! -Well, you have a lot of courage

15:16.375 --> 15:19.709
coming back here.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.875
-That's him.

15:21.917 --> 15:25.583
But it is nice to see you've got a more age appropriate

15:21.917 --> 15:25.583
date.

15:25.625 --> 15:28.417
-Get him, Gerry. -Gerry, that's not the lurker.

15:28.458 --> 15:31.250
-Yes it is the lurker. That's the guy!

15:31.291 --> 15:33.250
-That's him. -Que idiota.

15:35.500 --> 15:39.125
-My hair's always like this.

15:41.083 --> 15:43.875
-Okay, give this to me one more time please, 'cause I'm not

15:41.083 --> 15:43.875
following.

15:43.917 --> 15:46.041
-Miguel is Faith's nanny.

15:46.083 --> 15:48.250
-He picks her up three times a week.

15:48.291 --> 15:51.333
Is that allowed?

15:53.417 --> 15:56.250
There's such a thing? -Si, soy "a thing."

15:56.291 --> 15:58.667
: Si.

15:58.709 --> 16:02.083
Alright, then why was Faith pulling away and screaming

15:58.709 --> 16:02.083
I don't want to go?

16:02.125 --> 16:04.917
-...To the dentist. -I hate the dentist.

16:04.959 --> 16:07.542
Okay, well...

16:07.583 --> 16:11.291
-Okay, okay, to be fair to Mr. Duncan this was

16:07.583 --> 16:11.291
during lunch hour. And school policy is to have a

16:11.333 --> 16:15.041
note to excuse the child.

16:15.083 --> 16:17.000
-She's right. -I wrote a note.

16:17.041 --> 16:19.375
Faith, did you forget to give Mr. Duncan your note?

16:17.041 --> 16:19.375
-Yup!

16:19.417 --> 16:22.291
-I gave him the note. -Oh, you little liar.

16:22.333 --> 16:24.375
-I'm not lying, he stuffed it in his pocket.

16:24.417 --> 16:28.166
-Well, there's an easy way to check that out, 'cause I have

16:24.417 --> 16:28.166
four pockets and...

16:28.208 --> 16:31.417
Alright, there's a piece of paper. Let's see what that says.

16:35.667 --> 16:40.709
We have all said things that we wish we could take back.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.917
: Come on Mr. Duncan. -Okay, hold on!

16:42.959 --> 16:46.125
How come when I said police...  Po...Policia?

16:46.166 --> 16:49.333
-Let's just say Miguel's papers aren't technically in order.

16:49.375 --> 16:53.458
-Ohhhh -I assure you, Mrs Thomas,

16:49.375 --> 16:53.458
I will handle this.

16:53.500 --> 16:57.291
And Miguel, I apologize, lo siento, I am so sorry.

16:59.834 --> 17:03.083
-Next time read the note and maybe this won't happen again.

17:04.917 --> 17:09.500
-Good point. It's true. Coat. Shoes. You gotta be more...

17:09.542 --> 17:11.667
-A trench coat. -Yup, he...

17:11.709 --> 17:14.291
: With red shoes, Gerry. -Okay...

17:14.333 --> 17:17.083
Ugh! -Those were the gi...

17:17.125 --> 17:21.208
Yeah, sometimes my gist system fails.

17:21.250 --> 17:25.166
Pft. I guarantee he's not filing taxes.

17:26.500 --> 17:29.000
-Robert, we need to talk.

17:29.041 --> 17:32.709
-I think I know why I'm not in

17:29.041 --> 17:32.709
your little collage thingy.

17:32.750 --> 17:34.875
-It's a photo install... -Let me talk.

17:34.917 --> 17:38.500
-Okay, we had our fling but it's over and we're professionals.

17:38.542 --> 17:40.959
And I think it's time that you get over it.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.250
-Stop punishing me

17:43.291 --> 17:46.166
for not having the same feelings for you that you have for me.

17:46.208 --> 17:49.875
And put my picture up with everyone else's. Urgh!

17:49.917 --> 17:52.375
-Wow, that was something.

17:52.417 --> 17:54.542
-Thank you. I'm glad you see it my way.

17:58.417 --> 18:01.000
-You probably think this photo installation's about you.

18:01.041 --> 18:03.250
Don't you Don't you?

18:03.291 --> 18:07.625
For what it's worth, I did put a picture of you in the photo

18:03.291 --> 18:07.625
installation.

18:07.667 --> 18:09.166
-Well, it's kind of funny.

18:09.208 --> 18:12.875
I was going to put a bigger one to match the size of your ego.

18:12.917 --> 18:16.709
But then I remembered oh yeah, this isn't the Bobbi Galka photo

18:12.917 --> 18:16.709
installation.

18:16.750 --> 18:18.917
-I don't know what to say. I'm sorry.

18:18.959 --> 18:21.083
-Don't say anything. Apology not accepted.

18:21.125 --> 18:24.041
♪ Boodala bee bee bee ba didid ♪ News flash!

18:24.083 --> 18:26.125
Not everything's about you.

18:26.166 --> 18:28.500
-Okay, I'm sorry Robert.

18:28.542 --> 18:31.041
Oh, here I am! Super...

18:31.083 --> 18:33.083
Super duper small but...

18:33.125 --> 18:35.375
Tiny but...

18:36.250 --> 18:38.417
I look pretty great!

18:38.458 --> 18:41.000
'Cause it really pops. You know, you just see right away.

18:41.041 --> 18:43.125
There I am.

18:46.458 --> 18:49.000
: Nisha, how you doin'?

18:49.041 --> 18:50.917
-Well, as a matter of fact,

18:50.959 --> 18:53.583
and, I mean, I don't want this to be, like, a thing between us

18:53.625 --> 18:56.083
but, everyday's a holiday.

18:58.583 --> 19:01.250
-Actually, I've been thinking about it and, uh...

19:01.291 --> 19:03.709
I want you to have it.

19:03.750 --> 19:07.250
-You earned it. -Oh, thank you Paul!

19:07.291 --> 19:11.500
Oh thank you, you have no idea what a relief that is...

19:11.542 --> 19:13.875
To me. Thank you! -Cool.

19:13.917 --> 19:16.959
: Whoo. -Hey guys.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.750
Aaannd, how are we today?

19:24.333 --> 19:26.417
-Yes sir!

19:26.458 --> 19:28.959
: Yup, yes! : Mr. Dwyer...?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.542
: Ha, well never been locked in a basement

19:34.917 --> 19:39.083
-Okay...It's cool. Everything's workin' out.

19:39.125 --> 19:42.750
'Cause today's a holiday in my book, Buckaroo.

19:47.333 --> 19:49.959
-Hey, my little worker in

19:47.333 --> 19:49.959
Phys Ed.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.083
-Not a word kid. -Thought the British Bulldog,

19:50.000 --> 19:54.083
he was plowing over everybody!

19:54.125 --> 19:57.375
It was really good to see, but I hope we don't get the weather

19:54.125 --> 19:57.375
you're expecting, Dad.

19:57.417 --> 19:59.542
: Help me.

19:59.583 --> 20:01.500
: Help me.

20:01.542 --> 20:04.083
: But I really dig the shoes, where'd you get those?

20:01.542 --> 20:04.083
Can I...?
