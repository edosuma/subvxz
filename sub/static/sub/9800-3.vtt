00:11.665 --> 00:13.325
All right.
So why are we here?

00:13.879 --> 00:17.404
The question that has vexed
common man and philosopher alike.

00:18.903 --> 00:20.470
That's not what you're going for.

00:20.595 --> 00:23.041
Maurice said
he's got a very important announcement.

00:23.166 --> 00:25.274
All right,
might I have everyone's attention?

00:25.896 --> 00:27.542
Everyone, eyes and ears!

00:28.870 --> 00:30.669
Hello?
Is anyone listening?

00:31.165 --> 00:32.581
Quiet!

00:35.018 --> 00:36.018
Thank you.

00:36.345 --> 00:39.381
It is my honor
to introduce King Julien,

00:39.506 --> 00:42.082
leader of lemurs,
lord of the ringtails,

00:42.207 --> 00:43.559
et cetera, et cetera,

00:43.728 --> 00:44.697
et cetera!

00:55.017 --> 00:58.274
Thank you, Maurice,
for your hearty "et ceteras".

00:58.442 --> 00:59.847
I'll cut to the chases.

00:59.972 --> 01:03.779
In a few hours, we celebrate
the biggest holiday of the year.

01:03.947 --> 01:05.726
Christmas in july!

01:06.345 --> 01:07.351
Except...

01:07.476 --> 01:10.243
Not christmas, and it's not july.

01:10.787 --> 01:12.963
Look how playfully
they tease me, Maurice.

01:13.924 --> 01:16.895
You know I am speaking
of King Julien day.

01:17.121 --> 01:19.228
How could you not?
It's on every calendar.

01:20.813 --> 01:22.031
What about this one?

01:26.685 --> 01:28.170
There it is. See?

01:28.569 --> 01:30.973
So shut up and start shopping.

01:34.023 --> 01:36.611
So, what is King Julien day?

01:36.813 --> 01:40.203
On King Julien day,
everybody loads up the gifts on the King

01:40.328 --> 01:42.361
and pretty much
does whatever he says.

01:42.486 --> 01:44.279
It's eight kinds of fun.

01:44.546 --> 01:45.539
No lie.

01:46.056 --> 01:47.002
I see.

01:47.127 --> 01:49.013
Well, in that case, pass.

01:49.840 --> 01:50.593
Listen!

01:50.761 --> 01:52.563
You don't understand.

01:52.688 --> 01:55.041
You want King Julien
to be happy on his holiday.

01:55.411 --> 01:58.434
One time everyone forgot
about King Julien day, I tell you.

01:59.508 --> 02:02.117
Which forgetter is next
for their whooping?

02:02.485 --> 02:06.278
Come on!
I want you to hurt like I do!

02:09.592 --> 02:11.288
I couldn't sit right for a week.

02:11.555 --> 02:14.583
Trust me,
you do not want him to freak on you.

02:15.271 --> 02:16.719
We'll take our chances.

02:16.887 --> 02:17.753
Please!

02:18.218 --> 02:20.368
King Julien day
is my favorite holiday

02:20.493 --> 02:21.924
in the whole wide world!

02:22.092 --> 02:23.825
I love it this much!

02:24.027 --> 02:26.562
That's a whole lot of love
relative to body mass.

02:28.098 --> 02:30.432
Do you remember
that kid's birthday party, last week?

02:32.053 --> 02:34.370
Poor little chap's party
got rained out.

02:34.538 --> 02:36.257
When the humans ran for cover,

02:36.382 --> 02:38.107
Mort and I snatched this.

02:39.352 --> 02:41.724
Do you know
what the people put in these things?

02:42.312 --> 02:44.013
Candy! Lots of it.

02:44.181 --> 02:45.945
The forbidden fruit-flavored food?

02:46.070 --> 02:50.028
I crack it open on my belly
and dig out the creamy center.

02:52.689 --> 02:56.458
That's right. This piñata
is full of sweet deliciousness.

03:01.373 --> 03:02.464
What have we here?

03:06.937 --> 03:09.685
Lots more where this came from.
And it'll all be yours

03:09.810 --> 03:12.441
if you all just celebrate
King Julien day like you mean it.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.334
Happy me day!

03:22.114 --> 03:25.864
Maurice thinks he can bribe us
with his piñata promises.

03:26.161 --> 03:29.258
Sadly for him, we're not for sale.
Right, men?

03:29.814 --> 03:33.295
What all do you think is in there?
Butterscotch lollies and sourballs?

03:33.597 --> 03:35.833
I'd say
we're looking at a 50-50 mixture

03:35.958 --> 03:37.733
of gummy fish and candy buttons.

03:38.035 --> 03:39.034
Buttons!

03:39.204 --> 03:40.236
We may never know,

03:40.404 --> 03:44.039
'cause today, we're performing
scheduled maintenance on the HQ.

03:44.209 --> 03:45.975
Perhaps we could postpone?

03:46.143 --> 03:49.045
Negative. You can't just reschedule
scheduled maintenance

03:49.170 --> 03:50.379
that's been scheduled

03:50.547 --> 03:51.927
Right on the schedule!

03:53.950 --> 03:55.098
Skipper's right.

03:55.223 --> 03:57.642
Candy is candy.
I mean duty is duty.

04:02.331 --> 04:03.185
Buttons.

04:05.037 --> 04:07.226
Shore leave granted for today, men.

04:07.351 --> 04:08.741
Now get out of here.

04:08.866 --> 04:10.499
Bunch of knuckleheads.

04:13.475 --> 04:14.754
Where are my guests?

04:14.879 --> 04:16.802
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

04:16.927 --> 04:20.505
It is time to celebrate me
and the many moods of me.

04:20.630 --> 04:22.411
Today, festive me.

04:22.579 --> 04:25.219
King Julien day!
King Julien day!

04:25.684 --> 04:29.118
Hello.
We are here for the candy... party.

04:31.670 --> 04:35.324
Yes, welcome,
my loyal royal subjects.

04:35.714 --> 04:37.092
Happy King Julien day!

04:37.584 --> 04:40.015
See,
the otter is in the holiday spirit.

04:42.573 --> 04:46.146
Everyone now bask in the glory
that is King Julien.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.571
Go ahead. Bask.

04:52.476 --> 04:53.642
Bask harder!

04:56.493 --> 04:57.713
Now just the fellows.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.217
Ladies!

05:04.807 --> 05:06.716
The ladies sound a little weak.

05:06.983 --> 05:08.891
You know how that makes me, Maurice.

05:11.056 --> 05:13.817
Now, let's get this party started!

05:14.056 --> 05:16.308
Everybody, let's limbo!

05:17.619 --> 05:18.868
Limbo contest.

05:26.726 --> 05:28.292
Must have candy.

05:40.135 --> 05:44.018
Now I will make you all feel inferior,
which is proper.

05:50.089 --> 05:51.259
Did you see?

05:51.468 --> 05:55.387
I am not only the King,
but I am the limbo King too.

05:55.766 --> 05:58.007
King Julien wins the limbo contest.

05:58.175 --> 05:59.175
Thank you.

05:59.390 --> 06:02.635
Thank you for your boisterous
and loving cheers.

06:04.149 --> 06:05.730
Hello, New-York!

06:05.855 --> 06:09.095
Put your hands or other appendages
together now.

06:09.220 --> 06:11.835
Next,
the traditional King Julien day

06:11.960 --> 06:13.442
tossing of the fruit.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.792
Tossing of the fruit?

06:17.380 --> 06:19.224
Tossing it where exactly?

06:20.300 --> 06:21.864
At you exactly.

06:22.032 --> 06:22.880
At us?

06:24.568 --> 06:27.394
- Did I hear someone say no?
- He didn't say no.

06:30.459 --> 06:31.995
Chewy center.

06:32.476 --> 06:33.653
I said "yo".

06:33.778 --> 06:35.911
As in "yo, I am down with that".

06:36.079 --> 06:38.693
I'll buy that.
Then let the fruit fight begin.

06:42.152 --> 06:44.854
You love getting hit
with my unripe fruit.

06:45.055 --> 06:47.153
I can tell from your screams.

06:50.220 --> 06:53.229
Nothing more satisfying
than a job well done.

06:55.899 --> 06:57.333
I just cleaned that!

07:00.003 --> 07:01.136
What the?

07:04.041 --> 07:05.300
Now where was I?

07:05.745 --> 07:07.409
It's time for the bake-off.

07:07.578 --> 07:11.180
You have one hour to bake the King
the best King Julien day cake ever.

07:11.348 --> 07:13.797
Because what is a party
without a cake?

07:14.323 --> 07:17.386
It's still a party, I suppose,
but it feels like something is missing.

07:17.713 --> 07:19.391
Something cakey.

07:19.801 --> 07:21.383
Anyone here know how to bake?

07:22.766 --> 07:26.228
Why are they shaking when
they are supposed to be baking,

07:26.583 --> 07:28.364
Well, that's not what
they're saying.

07:28.740 --> 07:32.167
I think they are,
and I am about to freak on them.

07:34.643 --> 07:36.505
Here it comes.
The freak-out!

07:38.069 --> 07:39.705
I've always wanted to learn baking.

07:41.024 --> 07:42.290
See, no need to freak.

07:42.415 --> 07:44.246
The bake-off starts now.

08:04.034 --> 08:04.784
Time!

08:07.894 --> 08:09.046
Very nice.

08:09.171 --> 08:10.675
Do I see bugs in there?

08:10.800 --> 08:14.093
Lemurs love bugs, right?

08:16.912 --> 08:19.415
Ordinarily.
But I am on a low tick diet.

08:19.979 --> 08:23.277
- But... but... but.
- Pineapple upside down cake

08:23.402 --> 08:25.628
glazed with brown booger.

08:28.238 --> 08:30.039
My mistake.
Brown sugar.

08:31.296 --> 08:33.195
Just in case, Next!

08:36.003 --> 08:37.751
Death by chocolate.

08:38.828 --> 08:41.337
The chocolate part sounds promising.

08:41.505 --> 08:43.806
We didn't actually
have chocolate as such...

08:43.931 --> 08:44.940
Buttons!

08:45.773 --> 08:47.042
What did you have?

08:47.823 --> 08:49.024
Mainly mud.

08:49.314 --> 08:51.187
Nice presentation.

08:51.389 --> 08:54.785
Bring it so that my belly may taste
it's yumminess.

08:54.910 --> 08:56.151
I'll bring it.

09:02.594 --> 09:04.154
There. Good as new.

09:07.570 --> 09:10.366
I was so looking forward
to eating my delicious cake.

09:10.535 --> 09:12.668
How can I look forward
to eating nothing?

09:12.837 --> 09:13.836
Answer me!

09:14.004 --> 09:15.771
They'll make new cakes.

09:15.939 --> 09:18.704
- New bake-off on the double!
- Hold it, party boy.

09:19.096 --> 09:21.777
One quiet day
of scheduled maintenance.

09:21.946 --> 09:23.479
Is that too much to ask?

09:23.648 --> 09:24.404
Is it?

09:25.150 --> 09:27.550
You bombard me
with music and fruit and this.

09:27.675 --> 09:30.920
Newsflash, lower mammal,
there's no such thing as King Julien day

09:33.475 --> 09:34.644
Boy.

09:39.241 --> 09:40.890
My cake is back!

09:41.015 --> 09:42.598
It's my cake, everybody!

09:42.920 --> 09:44.254
It came back.

09:44.823 --> 09:45.868
Silly penguin.

09:46.123 --> 09:48.504
Have some in your head, not on it.

09:48.850 --> 09:49.817
I am the King

09:49.942 --> 09:53.037
that this was
the best King Julien day ever.

09:53.748 --> 09:54.778
I think so too.

09:55.810 --> 09:57.880
- What a sicko.
- Tell me about it.

09:58.048 --> 09:59.952
You saved my big old behind.

10:00.175 --> 10:02.591
And you earned this crew
one big old piñata.

10:05.856 --> 10:07.588
Candy! Candy!

10:10.640 --> 10:11.427
Right.

10:11.868 --> 10:12.934
Bang up job.

10:13.059 --> 10:15.764
I can almost taste
that butterscotch lolly.

10:16.454 --> 10:18.167
What do we have here?

10:18.336 --> 10:19.853
A big paper horse?

10:20.288 --> 10:23.966
How did you know that this
is the present I have always wanted?

10:24.298 --> 10:25.698
I will name him...

10:27.324 --> 10:29.578
Your Majesty,
that's actually a piñata.

10:29.932 --> 10:31.270
A pin-what-a?

10:31.395 --> 10:33.651
Why are you making up words,
Maurice?

10:33.911 --> 10:36.536
Come, Bob.
Let me show you around.

10:38.440 --> 10:40.054
But our... Our candy.

10:42.259 --> 10:43.192
Silly King me.

10:43.986 --> 10:47.990
I almost forgot the traditional
sharing of the sweets.

10:48.595 --> 10:51.951
And wouldn't you know,
Bob has candy guts.

10:52.609 --> 10:53.459
Dig in.

10:54.681 --> 10:56.933
Enjoy Bob's guts candy.
