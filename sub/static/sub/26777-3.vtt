12:07.259 --> 12:10.894

or evil here?

12:10.896 --> 12:12.896
Yeah, I definitely
felt something darker,

12:12.898 --> 12:14.098
like the whole time
I was here,

12:14.100 --> 12:16.500
I could feel something
grabbing my side,

12:16.502 --> 12:19.970
like it was trying
to maybe attach to
me or something.

12:19.972 --> 12:21.939
Demonic?
Yeah.

12:21.941 --> 12:23.841

12:23.843 --> 12:26.510
Yeah, but I think
it might follow the family.

grieving so bad, and --

12:28.748 --> 12:30.614

in some cemetery somewhere.

rotting, flesh, death.

the sixth stair.

Oh, absolutely.

15:32.331 --> 15:34.231
And what type
of activity?

15:34.233 --> 15:37.634
You could just feel him
when you'd walk in the door.

It was just this
electric kind of energy.

who cleaned the bathroom

15:45.211 --> 15:47.711
where Michael
had shot himself,

15:47.713 --> 15:49.746
he had been talking
to my brother.

15:49.748 --> 15:51.215
"You know,
why did you do this, Mike?"

15:51.217 --> 15:53.650
He was close to my brother.
He was angry with him.

15:53.652 --> 15:56.186
He had cleaner on the counter
when he was cleaning.

15:56.188 --> 15:58.555

fly off the counter.

Mm-hmm.

16:01.827 --> 16:05.095
Did Michael ever complain
about ghosts or spirits?

16:05.097 --> 16:07.931
His way of complaining
was a little bit different.

16:07.933 --> 16:08.799
Yeah.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.334
But he would
say things like,

16:10.336 --> 16:12.169
"I need to get
out of this house.

16:12.171 --> 16:15.505
I can't stay here anymore.
I need to get out."

16:15.507 --> 16:17.074
And he could
never really --

16:17.076 --> 16:19.843
Couldn't detail
the experiences.
Exactly.

16:19.845 --> 16:21.311
Do you believe
that it was because

16:21.313 --> 16:24.514
he was being influenced
by something unseen?

16:24.516 --> 16:25.716
I do.

16:25.718 --> 16:28.185
A spirit, a force?
I do.
I really do.

16:28.187 --> 16:30.354
Okay. And do you think
this spirit or force

16:30.356 --> 16:34.191
could be something dark that
is attached to your mother

16:34.193 --> 16:35.759
and has influenced
your other relatives?

16:35.761 --> 16:37.961
Yes, yes.

16:38.898 --> 16:41.031
Again, I've never
said this to her,

16:41.033 --> 16:44.668
but when we lived in
a different house in Hayward,

16:44.670 --> 16:47.537
there were ghosts there.

16:47.539 --> 16:48.772
I saw them myself.

16:48.774 --> 16:51.108
So activity has been
around your family

16:51.110 --> 16:52.309

16:52.311 --> 16:54.177

the men in your family

16:59.084 --> 17:00.751

Yes, yes, absolutely.
Absolutely.

17:03.422 --> 17:06.056
I don't know how to explain
what happened to Don.

17:06.058 --> 17:07.958
Don was your
mother's fiancè.

17:07.960 --> 17:11.028
That was her fiancè.
Was Don living
in<i> this</i> house?

17:11.030 --> 17:13.497
He lived in this house
for about 10 years.
He did?

17:13.499 --> 17:14.898
Yeah.
Okay.
When Don lived here,

17:14.900 --> 17:17.167
did he ever complain
of spirits or anything?

17:17.169 --> 17:19.670
Don wasn't
that kind of guy.

17:19.672 --> 17:23.874
But he -- I noticed a lot
when he would be in this house,

17:23.876 --> 17:25.342
he would get very angry.

17:25.344 --> 17:28.445

a sudden change of rage?

that he had to get
out of this house?

a bad kid. This isn't me,

32:07.292 --> 32:10.894
"I want to know who I really am,
and I'm not this,

32:10.896 --> 32:14.431
"so I don't want this anymore,"

32:14.433 --> 32:16.466
and then he says,
"Forgive me."

32:16.468 --> 32:17.934
It's like he's talking
to someone else,

32:17.936 --> 32:20.804
whether he's talking to God,
or whether he's talking to...

32:20.806 --> 32:22.472
He's saying, "Forgive me."

32:22.474 --> 32:25.842
ZAK:
Chris now starts picking up
on the woman's spirit,

32:25.844 --> 32:27.944
who we believe
to be Karon's mother

32:27.946 --> 32:29.780
who also committed suicide,

32:29.782 --> 32:33.550
and she's trying to help Michael
move on from this place.

32:37.589 --> 32:39.956
"She's helping me
bring peace to my son,

32:39.958 --> 32:42.359
to know that I am
more than just this.

32:42.361 --> 32:44.494
This was just
an experience for me."

32:46.398 --> 32:48.532
It's as if she's
reminding and telling him that

32:48.534 --> 32:51.768
"You must let go of this
and you must elevate

32:51.770 --> 32:54.271
so you won't be trapped here."

32:57.910 --> 32:59.409
That was the male.

32:59.411 --> 33:03.013
ZAK:
Chris now begins to detect
a darker, male presence.

33:03.015 --> 33:07.117
Could this be Karon's fiancè
that Chris detected earlier?

33:07.119 --> 33:08.251
There's a male
in this house, too.

33:08.253 --> 33:11.922
Yes, another male
that lived in this house.

33:11.924 --> 33:13.890
Male is not good.

33:13.892 --> 33:16.226
Male wants him
to stay here.

33:16.228 --> 33:18.762
Son of a -- the male
wants him to stay here,

33:18.764 --> 33:20.030
and the woman doesn't.

33:20.032 --> 33:22.332
The woman's trying
to help him cross,

33:22.334 --> 33:24.968
and the male wants him
to stay here.

33:24.970 --> 33:27.904
Is the male stuck here?
Is that why --

33:27.906 --> 33:30.774
He's here.
He doesn't want to leave.

33:30.776 --> 33:32.409
"This is like my place."

33:35.514 --> 33:37.814
ZAK: As Chris tries
to get a clear image

33:37.816 --> 33:39.616
of this darker male spirit,

33:39.618 --> 33:41.384
he heads into Michael's bedroom,

33:41.386 --> 33:43.253
at which time
I begin documenting

33:43.255 --> 33:45.255
a large figure behind him.

33:49.962 --> 33:52.763
ZAK: There's somebody
in the closet.

33:52.765 --> 33:54.164
CHRIS: Yeah.

33:54.166 --> 33:55.899
There's somebody standing
right next to you

33:55.901 --> 33:56.967
in the closet.

33:58.103 --> 34:00.003
Is it small or large?

34:00.005 --> 34:01.671
He's a large figure.

34:05.944 --> 34:07.177
ZAK:
All of a sudden,

34:07.179 --> 34:09.446
this large figure begins
raising its right arm

34:09.448 --> 34:11.815
in a threatening gesture
towards Chris

34:11.817 --> 34:14.151
and it even looks like
it's holding a gun.

34:17.289 --> 34:18.922
Now he's gone.

34:18.924 --> 34:20.357
As the figure vanishes,

34:20.359 --> 34:22.125
I feel a tremendous amount
of anger

34:22.127 --> 34:24.294
and I have to rush downstairs.

34:25.964 --> 34:28.465
Something's
coming up my legs.

34:30.369 --> 34:33.136
My legs are feeling --
Maybe it's all one.

34:33.138 --> 34:34.604
Sit over here.
Come over here.

34:34.606 --> 34:36.306
Hey, Zak.
Zak, come on in here.

34:36.308 --> 34:37.507
Huh?

34:37.509 --> 34:40.277
I want you to come forward.
I sense you.

34:41.180 --> 34:42.612
If something
comes through...

34:42.614 --> 34:44.481
My mother.
...allow it
to come through.

34:44.483 --> 34:46.383
Okay, I'm gonna
communicate with this.

34:46.385 --> 34:48.084
Alright, who is this?
Make yourself known.

34:48.086 --> 34:49.786
I demand that you
make yourself known.

34:49.788 --> 34:52.989
I'm aware of your presence
to her -- your attachment.

34:53.892 --> 34:55.725
Come forward.

34:55.727 --> 34:58.662
ZAK: As Chris takes Karon
and her daughter outside

34:58.664 --> 35:00.263
and continues to assist them,

35:00.265 --> 35:03.667
I begin capturing another figure
in the exact same spot

35:03.669 --> 35:07.704
where Chris saw Michael's spirit
come out of the wall earlier,

35:07.706 --> 35:10.707
and it is now that I remember
the family told me

35:10.709 --> 35:12.809
this was Michael's
favorite spot to stand.

35:12.811 --> 35:15.212
He would talk
to the family

35:15.214 --> 35:19.549
from right in the middle
of that hallway looking down.

35:19.551 --> 35:22.919
With Chris, Billy, Dakota,
and the family out front,

35:22.921 --> 35:25.055
Jay and myself at Nerve Center,

35:25.057 --> 35:28.458
and Aaron seen here entering
the downstairs bathroom,

35:28.460 --> 35:31.828
watch very closely
what happens to this front door,

35:31.830 --> 35:35.966
that's been open
for over 15 minutes.

35:35.968 --> 35:37.634
What just happened there?
What?

35:37.636 --> 35:40.070
The door just shut
or something by itself,

35:40.072 --> 35:41.872
it opened and shut --
the front door.

35:41.874 --> 35:42.839
Did you see it?
Yeah.

35:42.841 --> 35:44.107
I thought it was Aaron,

35:44.109 --> 35:46.076
but then I saw him
come out of the bathroom.

35:50.716 --> 35:53.717
ZAK:
They're way out there.
AARON: No, they're
<i>way</i> out there.

35:54.987 --> 35:57.053
Did you -- did somebody
just come up,

35:57.055 --> 35:58.321
open and close
this door?

35:58.323 --> 36:00.457
CHRIS: No, we've been
out front this entire time

36:00.459 --> 36:02.058
for at least five,
ten minutes.

36:02.060 --> 36:03.126
That door just
opened and closed.

36:03.128 --> 36:04.527
We just saw it
at Nerve Center.

36:04.529 --> 36:05.462
Oh.

36:05.464 --> 36:06.396
One of you guys
came and --

36:06.398 --> 36:07.464
No.
No.                         No.

36:07.466 --> 36:08.899
BILLY: No,
we've all been right here.

36:10.936 --> 36:12.602
That is very common
here.

36:12.604 --> 36:15.272
ZAK: Could this be
the aggressive male spirit

36:15.274 --> 36:17.607
telling us to stay
out of the house?

36:30.555 --> 36:32.889
As we go back inside
to investigate the door,

36:32.891 --> 36:34.891
we hear something upstairs.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.426
What?

36:36.428 --> 36:38.128
Whoa. What was that?

36:41.833 --> 36:43.900
That was upstairs.

36:43.902 --> 36:45.068
There's nobody up there.

36:45.070 --> 36:47.070
As we head up there
to investigate,

36:47.072 --> 36:50.106
Aaron and Billy are both hit
by a negative force of energy,

36:50.108 --> 36:52.175
that topples them over
like dominoes.

36:52.177 --> 36:54.077
Should we try
a spirit sweep?

36:54.079 --> 36:56.746
Dude. [Bleep].

36:56.748 --> 36:58.348
Holy [bleep].

36:58.350 --> 37:00.517
I feel like my head's
in a vise right now.

37:01.687 --> 37:04.454
I feel like
I can't breathe.
What?

37:04.456 --> 37:07.190
I feel like I can't breathe
and my head's being squeezed.

37:07.192 --> 37:08.358
What the hell's
wrong with you guys?

37:08.360 --> 37:09.960
I don't know, dude.

37:09.962 --> 37:11.494
What the hell?

37:12.864 --> 37:14.431
Are you getting angry?
Yeah, I did
for a minute.

37:14.433 --> 37:15.265
I know.

37:15.267 --> 37:16.533
Who is here?

37:16.535 --> 37:18.435
It felt like it had
a hold of my throat.

37:21.073 --> 37:23.507
♪♪

37:23.509 --> 37:26.310
ZAK: At this Oakdale,
California, residence,

37:26.312 --> 37:29.747
Billy and Aaron are
overwhelmed by a dark energy.

37:29.749 --> 37:32.316
AARON: I feel like
I can't breathe.
What?

37:32.318 --> 37:35.352
I feel like I can't breathe
and my head's being squeezed.

37:35.354 --> 37:36.553
What the hell's
wrong with you guys?

37:36.555 --> 37:38.088
I don't know, dude.

37:38.090 --> 37:39.356
What the hell?

37:40.893 --> 37:42.126
Bill?

37:42.128 --> 37:44.228
Hold on, I'm about to pass out,
man. I'm not kidding.

37:46.499 --> 37:47.865
Bill?

37:47.867 --> 37:50.000
Aaron? Aaron?

37:58.811 --> 38:02.479
Not once did I think
it was negative, for me,

38:02.481 --> 38:04.081
I just felt like
it was using my energy.

38:04.083 --> 38:06.817
I was like, use it, do it,
'cause it's helping things.

38:06.819 --> 38:08.318
But then as soon as
you came up,

38:08.320 --> 38:10.220
I just got that pain,

38:10.222 --> 38:12.623
and it went straight
like a cramp all the way

38:12.625 --> 38:13.924
and it started
going to my heart,

38:13.926 --> 38:14.958
I just -- I had to
get out of there.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.360
Standing at the
top of the stairs,

38:16.362 --> 38:18.395
you felt it
and it just rushed me,

38:18.397 --> 38:19.496
and it felt like
it had a hold of my throat

38:19.498 --> 38:20.998
and I couldn't breathe.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.132
And then my head --

38:22.134 --> 38:23.467
it felt like
it was being squeezed,

38:23.469 --> 38:25.002
I had to get out of there.

38:25.004 --> 38:27.337
It's so -- I've never
experienced that.

38:27.339 --> 38:30.074
Never experienced that.
That was scary.

38:31.744 --> 38:34.778
ZAK:
We now decide to bring
the spirit-sweep device

38:34.780 --> 38:36.213
inside the house,

38:36.215 --> 38:37.681
and prepare yourselves at home

38:37.683 --> 38:40.818
because we are about to receive
some incredible responses.

38:40.820 --> 38:42.886
I just feel like
we have to get some answers

38:42.888 --> 38:44.788
for this family.

38:44.790 --> 38:46.223
<i>[ Static ]</i>

38:48.594 --> 38:51.528
Who is here?
Can you say your name?

38:51.530 --> 38:53.330
<i>[ Indistinct voice ]</i>

38:53.332 --> 38:54.498
He heard me!

38:54.500 --> 38:56.266
We hear you!

38:56.268 --> 38:58.469
ZAK: He's telling us it hurts
when it --

38:58.471 --> 39:00.137
the last word
we can't make out.

39:00.139 --> 39:01.171
Can you?

39:01.173 --> 39:03.307
Who is here?
Can you say your name?

39:07.413 --> 39:08.612
He heard me!

39:09.448 --> 39:10.347
We hear you!

39:11.417 --> 39:14.518
<i>[ Indistinct voice</i> ]

39:14.520 --> 39:17.921
ZAK: Now this spirit comes
through and says, "One time."

39:17.923 --> 39:19.056
We hear you!

39:26.832 --> 39:29.133
As I ask
who we are talking to,

39:29.135 --> 39:31.668
we receive this
incredible response.

39:31.670 --> 39:32.870
<i>I'm human!</i>

39:37.309 --> 39:40.010
Billy moves the spirit sweep
to the top of the stairs,

39:40.012 --> 39:43.213
where he claims he felt
something squeezing his throat.

39:43.215 --> 39:45.482
Does the man
want to cross over?

39:45.484 --> 39:48.652
<i>The dimensions</i>
<i>will be respected.</i>

39:48.654 --> 39:51.021
"The dimensions
will be respected."

39:51.023 --> 39:52.089
Did you hear that?
Yes.

39:52.091 --> 39:53.690
"The dimensions
will be respected."

39:53.692 --> 39:56.593
Does the man
want to cross over?

40:07.273 --> 40:11.775
Can you try
to see if we can

40:11.777 --> 40:16.446
get this more aggressive
male spirit gone?

40:16.448 --> 40:17.648
Yeah.

40:17.650 --> 40:20.918
'Cause with our experiences,
what we personally felt,

40:20.920 --> 40:24.321
what I saw happen physically
with him and Aaron,

40:24.323 --> 40:26.690
I do believe
that that is here --

40:26.692 --> 40:28.025
the angry male.
There was a man.

40:28.027 --> 40:30.093
What was
your fiancè's name?

40:30.095 --> 40:31.528
Don.

40:31.530 --> 40:33.197
Was he mean?
Did he have a temper?

40:33.199 --> 40:35.666
He had a temper,
but he also had a big heart.

40:35.668 --> 40:37.301
Okay.
When he was in<i> this</i> house,

40:37.303 --> 40:39.903
did he have any bouts
of unexplained rage?

40:39.905 --> 40:41.405
Yeah.

40:41.407 --> 40:44.575
ZAK:
For no reason whatsoever,
as we are all downstairs

40:44.577 --> 40:46.443
and closing out
this investigation,

40:46.445 --> 40:48.145
I lunge at Aaron's camera

40:48.147 --> 40:50.147
and literally throw it
to the ground.

40:52.218 --> 40:53.684
ZAK:
Are you okay?

40:57.723 --> 40:59.223
Hmm?
Are you getting angry?

40:59.225 --> 41:02.492
Yeah,
I did for a minute.
I know.
I can feel it, man.

41:02.494 --> 41:03.694
There was no
even need for me

41:03.696 --> 41:05.295
to do what I just did.
I know. I know.

41:05.297 --> 41:07.197
Like, there was
no need for that.

41:07.199 --> 41:09.233
It's what's here --
doesn't want us here.

41:12.538 --> 41:13.704
I'm sorry.

41:13.706 --> 41:15.906
She said, too, she would
get angry sometimes...

41:15.908 --> 41:17.407
For no reason.
...for no reason.

41:20.813 --> 41:22.579
Hmm?
What do you
want us to do?

41:24.016 --> 41:27.117
I know you enough
to know your energy.

41:28.654 --> 41:30.220
I'm just gonna
stand over here.

41:30.222 --> 41:31.421
He's fired up.

41:31.423 --> 41:33.790
Yeah.
I can feel it, too.

41:41.233 --> 41:44.501
ZAK:
As we depart with a cleansing
to the spirits here...

41:44.503 --> 41:45.502
These prayers
are for you.

41:45.504 --> 41:47.371
...we won't ever
forget the pain

41:47.373 --> 41:49.006
that will last forever.

41:49.008 --> 41:52.075
"Attack every open spirit
in Jesus' name."

41:52.077 --> 41:55.445
But hopefully that pain
can become peace,

41:55.447 --> 41:59.249
and that peace can become hope
for better days to come.

41:59.251 --> 42:00.517
Amen.
