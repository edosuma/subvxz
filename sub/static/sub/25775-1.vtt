01:53.303 --> 01:54.600
- Please don't!

01:54.600 --> 01:57.031
Stop, stop!

01:58.348 --> 02:00.540
- What I told
you about that shit, huh?

02:00.540 --> 02:01.835
Huh?

02:01.835 --> 02:04.752
- I'm sorry!

02:16.213 --> 02:19.046
- Tell me you're "Daddy's little girl."

02:19.046 --> 02:21.546
- I'm "Daddy's little girl."

03:27.971 --> 03:30.137
- Hello?

03:30.137 --> 03:31.682
- You have
a call from an inmate

03:31.682 --> 03:33.341
at a correctional facility.

03:33.341 --> 03:36.025
Will you accept the charges?
- Yes.

03:36.025 --> 03:38.219
- Thank you, you are connected.

03:38.219 --> 03:40.050
- Hey, what's up?

03:40.050 --> 03:42.066
- Hey, I should
be asking you that.

03:42.066 --> 03:43.730
You haven't been to see me in a while.

03:43.730 --> 03:45.431
Is everything good?
- Yes.

03:45.431 --> 03:47.260
Everything's fine.

03:47.260 --> 03:48.725
- You sure?

03:48.725 --> 03:52.338
- Yes, I'm sure, now would
you stop worrying about me?

03:52.338 --> 03:55.746
- Hey, I'm your
brother, it's my job to.

03:55.746 --> 03:57.976
- Anyways, do you need anything?

03:57.976 --> 03:59.309
- Naw.

04:00.170 --> 04:03.670
My books are always full... Thanks to you.

04:04.988 --> 04:07.321
- It's the least I could do.

04:08.771 --> 04:11.206
After everything you've done for me.

04:11.206 --> 04:12.847
- Hey, let's
not talk about that.

04:12.847 --> 04:14.178
I just called to just make sure

04:14.178 --> 04:16.045
that everything was one hundred.

04:16.045 --> 04:18.611
And to make sure you get down here
to see me real soon.

04:18.611 --> 04:20.572
I miss you.
- I miss you, too.

04:20.572 --> 04:21.709
And I will.

06:13.817 --> 06:17.232
- Thanks for seeing
me on such short notice.

06:17.232 --> 06:19.640
- It's not a problem, I had
a last minute cancellation.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.307
Please, have a seat.

06:25.702 --> 06:27.769
So, what brings you by?

06:27.769 --> 06:29.882
- I'm having the dreams, again.

06:29.882 --> 06:32.520
- OK, and how do they make you feel?

06:32.520 --> 06:36.114
- You know how they make
me feel, they terrify me.

06:36.114 --> 06:39.363
They're starting to
affect my personal life.

06:39.363 --> 06:42.113
And they make me feel so unclean.

06:43.341 --> 06:45.134
- Well, Maxine, you definitely don't have

06:45.134 --> 06:46.760
anything to worry about.

06:46.760 --> 06:49.113
And you don't wanna go
around feeling unclean.

06:49.113 --> 06:50.941
Your step-father abused you.

06:50.941 --> 06:53.414
He was the one who was wrong.

06:53.414 --> 06:56.826
And we both know he's dead,
your brother killed him.

06:56.826 --> 06:57.659
Remember?

06:59.813 --> 07:00.646
- Yeah.

07:01.763 --> 07:04.002
- Hey, instead of focusing
on the negative past,

07:04.002 --> 07:05.536
let's focus on the here and now.

07:05.536 --> 07:07.853
How are you and Lance?

07:07.853 --> 07:11.219
- We're great, couldn't be happier.

07:11.219 --> 07:15.493
When I'm with him, all my
problems seem so unimportant.

07:15.493 --> 07:16.493
So far away.

07:17.685 --> 07:20.481
- You should see your face
when you tell that story.

07:20.481 --> 07:21.314
You glow.

07:41.744 --> 07:44.542
- Hello?

07:44.542 --> 07:46.536
- Hey, what's up, babe?

07:46.536 --> 07:49.782
- Hey yourself, when are you coming over?

07:49.782 --> 07:51.817
- That's actually
why I was calling.

07:51.817 --> 07:55.147
I'm not gonna be able to
make it, something came up.

07:55.147 --> 07:57.050
- Is anything wrong?

07:57.050 --> 07:58.483
- Oh, no, everything is good.

07:58.483 --> 08:00.426
Just a little quick fix.

08:00.426 --> 08:03.017
How was that visit with Curtis?

08:03.017 --> 08:04.765
- It went well.

08:04.765 --> 08:06.064
- Cool, cool, cool.

08:06.064 --> 08:07.364
Listen, I gotta get back to work.

08:07.364 --> 08:09.309
I'ma hit you back later, alright?

08:09.309 --> 08:11.663
- OK, I'll be waiting.

08:11.663 --> 08:13.163
- Alright.

08:43.142 --> 08:44.983
- Yo, it's your boy Lance.

08:44.983 --> 08:49.126
You know what to do.

08:49.126 --> 08:51.293
- Hey, babe, call me back.

09:12.201 --> 09:15.701
- So, have you told Maxine about us yet?

09:17.030 --> 09:18.613
- No.
- And why not?

09:19.799 --> 09:22.599
- You just don't pop up
and say it all of a sudden.

09:22.599 --> 09:24.712
It's gotta be the right time.

09:24.712 --> 09:27.644
- Right time, yeah.
- Yeah.

09:27.644 --> 09:29.921
- Look, there's
never a right time

09:29.921 --> 09:33.332
to tell somebody you found somebody else.

09:33.332 --> 09:36.582
Especially if you already screwin' 'em.

09:37.519 --> 09:39.959
- What?

09:39.959 --> 09:41.745
- Wow, I'm starting to
feel like you don't wanna

09:41.745 --> 09:43.325
break it off with her.

09:43.325 --> 09:46.621
Maybe you like having two women around?

09:46.621 --> 09:49.428
- Shit, you might be right.

09:49.428 --> 09:51.097
- Oh, really?

09:51.097 --> 09:52.967
Well, newsflash, I'm not about to

09:52.967 --> 09:55.122
keep playin' the other woman.

09:55.122 --> 09:57.354
So I'ma need you to make a decision.

09:57.354 --> 09:58.187
And fast.

10:00.811 --> 10:04.966
But just so you choose right,

10:04.966 --> 10:09.393
let me show you what you'll
be missin' if you don't.

10:18.713 --> 10:19.546
- Damn.

10:26.782 --> 10:30.949
- Yeah, mmm, oh!

10:36.152 --> 10:36.985
- Hey!

10:38.054 --> 10:39.054
- Sup, baby?

10:40.128 --> 10:41.430
Hey, um,

10:41.430 --> 10:43.299
we need to talk.

10:43.299 --> 10:45.132
- About what?

10:46.483 --> 10:48.233
- Us.
- What about us?

10:49.233 --> 10:50.733
We're good, right?

10:51.591 --> 10:53.174
- Yeah, we're good.

10:56.675 --> 10:59.233
- Good, 'cause I have great news.

10:59.233 --> 11:01.343
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

11:01.343 --> 11:02.426
- What is it?

11:03.295 --> 11:04.545
- I'm pregnant!

11:07.638 --> 11:10.471
Well, are you gonna say something?

11:11.937 --> 11:13.562
- Listen, I'm sorry, I just,

11:13.562 --> 11:15.064
it's unexpected.

11:15.064 --> 11:17.481
Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

11:18.514 --> 11:21.685
This isn't the reaction I was hoping for.

11:21.685 --> 11:24.326
I thought you'd be more happy.

11:24.326 --> 11:26.925
We've always talked about having children.

11:26.925 --> 11:28.713
You still want that, right?

11:28.713 --> 11:30.988
- Yeah, I mean, I do, but,

11:30.988 --> 11:32.975
there's just so much going on right now.

11:32.975 --> 11:36.956
And this happened quicker than I thought.

11:36.956 --> 11:37.853
- What?

11:37.853 --> 11:39.958
You got her pregnant, man?
- Damn!

11:39.958 --> 11:41.658
- Yeah, bro.

11:41.658 --> 11:43.443
- Oh, man, that ain't
gonna fly right with Lana.

11:43.443 --> 11:44.985
Man, I'm tryin' to tell you.

11:44.985 --> 11:46.324
For nothing.
- Hell naw,

11:46.324 --> 11:47.457
not no black woman.

11:47.457 --> 11:49.730
- Listen, man, I appreciate
y'all stating the obvious,

11:49.730 --> 11:51.234
but don't you think I know that already?

11:51.234 --> 11:52.769
- Hey, don't shoot the messenger.

11:52.769 --> 11:53.902
I'm just keepin' it real with you, man.

11:53.902 --> 11:55.363
I know thickness.

11:55.363 --> 11:57.549
Damn.
- Real rap, bro....

11:57.549 --> 12:00.629
I know it may sound funny,
but I'm not even upset

12:00.629 --> 12:03.020
about the news at all.
- What?

12:03.020 --> 12:04.227
- What's runnin'
through your mind?

12:04.227 --> 12:07.308
- So, you tryin' to be with Maxine now?

12:07.308 --> 12:08.401
- I don't know, dog, I mean,

12:08.401 --> 12:10.756
shit, I like em' both.

12:10.756 --> 12:12.338
But um,

12:12.338 --> 12:13.755
I don't know....Lana man....

12:13.755 --> 12:16.953
She gave me some compelling reasons
to choose her last night.

12:16.953 --> 12:18.928
- Word?
- It's real.

12:18.928 --> 12:22.967
- Damn, whoa.

12:22.967 --> 12:24.509
- Bro, whip his motherfuckin' ass, bro.

12:24.509 --> 12:25.969
For real!

12:25.969 --> 12:27.554
- World star!
- Be cool, man.

12:27.554 --> 12:29.471
There you go, dog...

12:38.533 --> 12:40.283
- Maxine, what's new?

12:41.742 --> 12:42.575
- Lance.

12:44.093 --> 12:46.360
I think he's seein' another woman.

12:46.360 --> 12:48.387
- And what makes you think that?

12:48.387 --> 12:50.661
- It's just a gut feelin'.

12:50.661 --> 12:53.939
He came over yesterday and
said we needed to talk.

12:53.939 --> 12:57.095
I don't know, he was just
actin' really strange.

12:57.095 --> 12:59.082
- And what did he say?

12:59.082 --> 13:03.775
- Nothing, I didn't give him
a chance to say anything.

13:03.775 --> 13:05.150
- I think you should probably wait

13:05.150 --> 13:06.402
to see what Lance has to say

13:06.402 --> 13:10.365
before you jump to assuming the worst.

13:10.365 --> 13:13.425
What's wrong, why the long face?

13:13.425 --> 13:14.258
- I lied.

13:16.286 --> 13:18.618
I told him I was pregnant.

13:18.618 --> 13:21.722
- You know you can't trick
a man into staying with you?

13:21.722 --> 13:23.272
If he really wants to leave

13:23.272 --> 13:26.454
you need to accept it and move on.

13:26.454 --> 13:27.287
- I can't.

13:28.780 --> 13:30.384
- Why not?

13:30.384 --> 13:33.134
- Because, he's everything to me.

13:34.387 --> 13:37.137
He's my peace in an insane world.

13:38.511 --> 13:41.118
And when I feel as though
I'm about to lose it,

13:41.118 --> 13:44.285
I just close my eyes and think of him.

13:45.686 --> 13:49.078
And everything seems to get better.

13:49.078 --> 13:52.962
I don't think I can live
without him, Dr. Curtis.

13:52.962 --> 13:57.294
- You can, that's not true,
you're stronger than you think.

13:57.294 --> 13:59.297
And don't lose sight of that.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.584
I mean, you survived a lot this past year

14:01.584 --> 14:06.084
and whatever happens, don't
lose control of your life.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.585
- I can help you, you know.

14:49.585 --> 14:50.418
- Go away.

14:51.513 --> 14:52.943
I don't need your help.

14:52.943 --> 14:56.292
- Really?

14:56.292 --> 14:58.090
Is that why you're home alone

14:58.090 --> 15:00.336
wondering what your
boyfriend is out doing?

15:00.336 --> 15:02.873
Oh, I'm sorry, who he's doing.

15:02.873 --> 15:03.706
- Shut up!

15:05.448 --> 15:07.698
- I can fix this.

15:07.698 --> 15:11.221
The same way I fixed Milo.
- No.

15:11.221 --> 15:13.471
I won't let you hurt Lance.

15:14.903 --> 15:16.862
- I can't believe this.

15:16.862 --> 15:19.468
You're the same pathetic little whiner

15:19.468 --> 15:22.123
you were in high school.
- No.

15:22.123 --> 15:22.956
I'm not.

15:25.224 --> 15:27.807
- Lance promised you the world.

15:28.911 --> 15:32.712
He told you he wanted
to father your children.

15:32.712 --> 15:34.428
And now he wants to

15:34.428 --> 15:37.725
throw you away like you're trash.

15:37.725 --> 15:40.706
- He's not cheating on me.

15:40.706 --> 15:44.259
- I don't know, who
knows, maybe you're right.

15:44.259 --> 15:45.926
And if he's not then

15:47.216 --> 15:49.049
everything's all good.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.284
- And if he is?

15:54.310 --> 15:55.810
- I make him hurt.

15:56.721 --> 15:58.388
The way he hurt you.

15:59.419 --> 16:00.401
Then some.

16:00.401 --> 16:01.341
- No!

16:01.341 --> 16:03.058
- Think about it.

16:03.058 --> 16:04.700
If you take those,

16:04.700 --> 16:06.117
I can't help you.

16:07.065 --> 16:09.898
And you will never know the truth.

16:16.490 --> 16:20.119
- Well, are you gonna say something?

16:20.119 --> 16:20.952
- Yeah.

16:22.895 --> 16:26.367
As soon as I can without
knocking the shit out of you.

16:26.367 --> 16:28.735
- Look, you need to be cool.

16:28.735 --> 16:30.165
I know this comes as a surprise.

16:30.165 --> 16:31.165
- You think?

16:35.761 --> 16:40.181
Are you sure she's pregnant?

16:40.181 --> 16:41.514
- What?
- I mean,

16:42.625 --> 16:44.296
she coulda found out that you were tryin'

16:44.296 --> 16:46.378
to leave her or something.

16:46.378 --> 16:50.421
Or, this could be her way of
trying to keep a hold on you.

16:50.421 --> 16:52.258
Man, women do this shit all the time.

16:52.258 --> 16:54.175
This ain't nothin' new.

16:55.081 --> 16:55.914
- Listen,

16:57.007 --> 16:58.340
she's not lyin'.

16:59.297 --> 17:02.891
- But are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

17:02.891 --> 17:06.036
Listen, I've been with
Maxine over two years now.

17:06.036 --> 17:08.811
Lyin' isn't in her,
that's not even her style.

17:08.811 --> 17:12.145
If she says she's pregnant, then she is.

17:13.382 --> 17:15.049
Period.
- Oh, really?

17:17.494 --> 17:18.328
Okay.

17:32.639 --> 17:35.194
- Hello?

17:35.194 --> 17:36.194
- Hey, girl.

17:37.276 --> 17:39.026
- Oh, hey, Brenda.

17:39.925 --> 17:42.057
- What are you doing?

17:42.057 --> 17:47.057
- Nothing, just sittin' here
waiting on Lance to come home.

17:47.611 --> 17:49.323
- Is everything okay?

17:49.323 --> 17:51.199
You sound a bit out of it.

17:51.199 --> 17:56.199
- Mm, I think
Lance is having an affair.

17:58.802 --> 17:59.635
Brenda?

18:00.532 --> 18:04.115
Are you still there?
- Yeah, I'm still here.

18:06.001 --> 18:08.289
Look, I hate to be the bearer of bad news,

18:08.289 --> 18:10.372
but I think you're right.

18:11.470 --> 18:15.717
I overheard Mike talking to him
on the phone the other week.

18:15.717 --> 18:17.772
- And?
- Well, it looks like

18:17.772 --> 18:21.122
he's been hooking up with Lana.

18:21.122 --> 18:22.547
- Lana?

18:22.547 --> 18:23.464
Who's Lana?

18:24.341 --> 18:26.591
Wait, Lana the video bitch?

18:28.307 --> 18:31.042
- That would be the one.

18:31.042 --> 18:32.755
- I don't believe this.

18:32.755 --> 18:34.264
You're supposed to be my friend.

18:34.264 --> 18:36.143
Why didn't you tell me this sooner?

18:36.143 --> 18:38.185
- Like I said, I overheard
Mike talking to him

18:38.185 --> 18:41.648
the other week, plus I
only heard bits and pieces.

18:41.648 --> 18:43.036
I didn't wanna come at you with this

18:43.036 --> 18:45.276
and not be sure about it.

18:45.276 --> 18:47.645
- Well, thanks for telling me.

18:47.645 --> 18:51.321
I guess it's good not
being to talk about things.

18:51.321 --> 18:52.154
- Okay.

18:53.201 --> 18:56.034
Bye.

18:58.798 --> 18:59.902
- Who was that?

18:59.902 --> 19:01.167
- It was Max.

19:01.167 --> 19:04.756
- How is she doin'?
- She's doin' pretty good.

19:04.756 --> 19:06.996
- Cool, well, goodnight, babe.

19:12.917 --> 19:16.633
- Babe, are you in the mood
for a little pillow talk?

19:16.633 --> 19:19.905
- Not tonight, babe.

19:19.905 --> 19:21.155
Got a headache.

19:44.482 --> 19:46.604
- So, your precious
little Lance is just like

19:46.604 --> 19:48.776
all the other guys, after all.

19:48.776 --> 19:52.125
Screwin' any bimbo who will open her legs.

19:52.125 --> 19:53.792
- Please, just stop!

19:55.145 --> 19:59.267
- And to top it all off,

19:59.267 --> 20:01.721
he left you for a video groupie.

20:01.721 --> 20:04.554
- Don't.
- Stop being weak, Maxine.

20:05.606 --> 20:09.023
Give in, let me do what needs to be done.

20:14.151 --> 20:14.984
That's it,

20:16.078 --> 20:16.911
give in.

20:38.377 --> 20:40.336
- Hello, handsome.

20:40.336 --> 20:41.503
You look nice.

20:42.345 --> 20:44.701
- Appreciate it, you do too.

20:44.701 --> 20:46.376
This is a different look for you, though.

20:46.376 --> 20:48.099
What you got going on?

20:48.099 --> 20:52.024
- Well, I figured, you only live once.

20:52.024 --> 20:55.047
What's the point of living
if you don't feel alive?

20:55.047 --> 20:56.920
- What are you doing?

20:56.920 --> 20:58.186
How much have you had?

20:58.186 --> 20:59.944
You shouldn't be drinking
in your condition.

20:59.944 --> 21:04.233
- Not nearly enough.

21:04.233 --> 21:06.316
Now, come give me a kiss.

21:09.100 --> 21:11.140
Oh, come on!

21:11.140 --> 21:12.737
You call that a kiss?

21:12.737 --> 21:14.734
- Your drunk, give me that shit.

21:14.734 --> 21:18.901
I'm goin' to sleep.

21:25.395 --> 21:26.400

22:41.186 --> 22:42.019
- I would,

22:43.109 --> 22:45.147
but I'd be lying.

22:47.307 --> 22:51.242
- He's never gonna forgive me for this.

22:51.242 --> 22:52.409
- Forgive you?

22:53.451 --> 22:56.873
He's the one that needs forgiveness.

22:56.873 --> 22:59.000
- You think this is a game?

22:59.000 --> 23:00.632
This is kidnapping.

23:00.632 --> 23:03.326
A mandatory life sentence.

23:03.326 --> 23:04.159
- Relax!

23:05.530 --> 23:08.447
That only happens if we get caught.

23:09.449 --> 23:12.778
- What do you think he's gonna
do when he gets out of here?

23:12.778 --> 23:15.677
- And who says he's getting out of here?

23:15.677 --> 23:16.844
Alive anyways.

23:34.561 --> 23:35.394
- Yo!

23:37.292 --> 23:39.007
What the fuck is going on?

23:39.007 --> 23:40.595
Yo!

23:40.595 --> 23:41.762
Somebody help!

23:50.108 --> 23:52.312
- What up, this
Sean, leave a message.

23:53.701 --> 23:55.247
- Sean, why aren't you answering?

23:55.247 --> 23:56.267
I've called you three times

23:56.267 --> 23:58.881
and I really need to talk to you.

24:01.122 --> 24:03.124
Look, just stop by when you get a chance.

24:03.124 --> 24:05.208
I'll be home all day.

24:11.791 --> 24:13.119
Hey, dad, thanks for coming.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.236
- No problem, baby girl.

24:15.236 --> 24:18.013
What's the problem? It seemed important..

24:18.013 --> 24:20.801
- It's Lance.

24:20.801 --> 24:23.966
- Oh, Lance, the rapper boyfriend.

24:23.966 --> 24:27.601
- Dad, he is not a rapper,
he shoots music videos.

24:27.601 --> 24:30.465
- Anyway, so what's this about?

24:30.465 --> 24:33.038
- Well, he's missing.

24:33.038 --> 24:34.923
- Missing, what do you mean missing?

24:34.923 --> 24:36.847
- Just that, nobody has
seen or heard from him

24:36.847 --> 24:38.097
in over a week.

24:39.420 --> 24:40.847
- Have you called the police?

24:40.847 --> 24:43.703
- Of course I have, but because
of who he is and what he do,

24:43.703 --> 24:46.032
man, you know they ain't
taking the thing serious.

24:46.032 --> 24:48.319
- Well, honey, can you blame them?

24:48.319 --> 24:50.882
Everyone knows these rapper types.

24:50.882 --> 24:53.871
They live wild and crazy lifestyles.

24:53.871 --> 24:55.509
I mean, it's nothing for them to pick up

24:55.509 --> 24:58.574
with their entourage and
disappear for a weekend.

24:58.574 --> 25:01.598
And it's also nothing for
them to get what they want

25:01.598 --> 25:03.964
from a good girl and disappear.

25:03.964 --> 25:07.464
- Dad, Lance loves me, he didn't leave me.

25:08.701 --> 25:09.951
- OK, maybe so.

25:11.358 --> 25:15.928
Baby girl, you gotta admit
that that's a possibility.

25:15.928 --> 25:19.392
Now look, while I'm here, what can I do?

25:19.392 --> 25:20.225
- Well,

25:21.555 --> 25:23.573
I need you to do something about it.

25:23.573 --> 25:28.310
- OK, something as in?
- You're a ex-police officer.

25:28.310 --> 25:29.779
Right?

25:29.779 --> 25:32.674
And you still have connections
with the department.

25:32.674 --> 25:35.778
So I need you to make sure
they take this thing serious.

25:35.778 --> 25:37.366
Alright, look,

25:37.366 --> 25:38.881
man, I'll see what I can do,

25:38.881 --> 25:41.754
but I can't make any promises, OK?

25:41.754 --> 25:44.403
- Alright, thanks, dad.
- Alright.

25:44.403 --> 25:46.448
- But, I gotta go make a run, so,

25:46.448 --> 25:48.239
'bout to go take a shower,
freshen up a little bit.

25:48.239 --> 25:49.789
Okay?
- Alright, I'll see you later.

25:49.789 --> 25:51.122
- Alright daddy.

25:52.600 --> 25:55.850
And don't be talking about my boyfriend.

26:01.218 --> 26:03.702
- Here, I brought you some food.

26:03.702 --> 26:06.922
- I'm not hungry.

26:06.922 --> 26:08.143
- Suit yourself, but you're gonna

26:08.143 --> 26:09.943
have to eat sooner or later.

26:09.943 --> 26:12.308
Unless you wanna starve to death?

26:12.308 --> 26:15.131
- Why are you doing this?
- You were going to leave me.

26:15.131 --> 26:17.006
- No I wasn't.

26:17.006 --> 26:19.823
- You can't tell me the
truth to save your life.

26:19.823 --> 26:23.990
Tell me you wasn't screwin'
that video bitch Lana?

26:25.820 --> 26:27.462
I thought so.

26:27.462 --> 26:29.212
- Look, you're right.

26:30.362 --> 26:32.690
I was seein' her, but I
wasn't going anywhere.

26:32.690 --> 26:36.235
Yeah, I thought about it, shit, sure.

26:36.235 --> 26:38.647
But when I found out
that you was pregnant,

26:38.647 --> 26:41.218
all I could think about was our family.

26:41.218 --> 26:44.468
- I don't believe you.
- It's true, Max.

26:46.284 --> 26:48.981
Just think about our family,
you still want that, right?

26:48.981 --> 26:51.898
- It's not that easy now.
- Why not?

26:53.921 --> 26:56.901
- She's involved.

26:56.901 --> 26:58.492
- She who?

26:58.492 --> 27:02.409
- Yeah, Max, she who?

27:03.803 --> 27:05.355
- Max, what the hell are you lookin' at?

27:05.355 --> 27:06.855
Someone else here?

27:09.238 --> 27:10.071
- Yes.

27:11.445 --> 27:14.964
- What's she sayin'?
- She wants you to suffer.

27:14.964 --> 27:16.840
- Don't listen to her, baby, fight her.

27:16.840 --> 27:18.514
You hear me?

27:18.514 --> 27:20.635
- I can't.
- Yes you can, Max.

27:20.635 --> 27:22.434
Just think about the baby.

27:22.434 --> 27:27.242
Do you really want her to
harm the father of your baby?

27:27.242 --> 27:30.331
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK, sweetheart.

27:30.331 --> 27:34.870
Just undo these cuffs so
we can get outta here.

27:34.870 --> 27:39.267
- You actually think it's
gonna be that simple?

27:39.267 --> 27:41.184
Enjoy your meal.
- Wait!

27:43.251 --> 27:44.251
Who are you?

27:46.557 --> 27:50.390
- The last woman you
ever wanted to fuck with.

28:05.486 --> 28:06.819
- Oh, hey, Sean.

28:07.812 --> 28:09.242
- Hey, Sean?

28:09.242 --> 28:10.999
You ain't got to sound so disappointed.

28:10.999 --> 28:12.223
- I'm sorry.

28:12.223 --> 28:13.819
I just thought you might be Lance.

28:13.819 --> 28:14.922
- So what's up?

28:14.922 --> 28:16.512
I got the voicemail, it sounded urgent.

28:16.512 --> 28:18.428
- It is, have you seen Lance?

28:18.428 --> 28:20.058
- Naw, not for about a week.

28:20.058 --> 28:21.853
I mean, he didn't even show
up for the last two sessions

28:21.853 --> 28:23.853
to wrap up the final
takes of the new video.

28:23.853 --> 28:25.690
- And you don't find that strange?

28:25.690 --> 28:26.994
- No, not for Lance.

28:26.994 --> 28:29.041
- Honestly, I think something
has happened to him for real.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.588
Like, he hasn't called, he hasn't come by.

28:30.588 --> 28:32.676
And every time I call him it
goes straight to voicemail.

28:32.676 --> 28:33.736
- Ain't nothing happen to him.

28:33.736 --> 28:35.366
He just on another one of his benders.

28:35.366 --> 28:36.917
- God, you sound like the police.

28:36.917 --> 28:37.750
- The police?

28:37.750 --> 28:39.365
You called the cops?
- Uh, yeah.

28:39.365 --> 28:41.202
And you sound even less
concerned than they do.

28:41.202 --> 28:42.221
They said he might be in Vegas

28:42.221 --> 28:43.773
with some new girlfriend or something.

28:43.773 --> 28:44.995
- And they probably right.

28:44.995 --> 28:46.793
- Sean, that's not funny.
- I mean, I ain't tryin to be.

28:46.793 --> 28:49.960
But, I told you how he was before
you left me for him.

28:49.960 --> 28:52.090
- Sean, I've told you a million times,

28:52.090 --> 28:53.608
I didn't leave you for Lance.

28:53.608 --> 28:55.200
I don't understand what you don't get.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.873
Me and you was already broke up two months

28:56.873 --> 28:58.461
before me and Lance
had our first date.

28:58.461 --> 28:59.645
- Yeah, yeah, whatever.

28:59.645 --> 29:01.273
So, what's up, what you
call me over here for?

29:01.273 --> 29:02.494
What you wanna see me for?

29:02.494 --> 29:04.657
- Look, I need you to ask around.

29:04.657 --> 29:06.069
See if anybody done heard from him,

29:06.069 --> 29:07.210
seen him, or something.

29:07.210 --> 29:08.043
Can you do that?

29:08.043 --> 29:10.206
- What, you want me to
go lookin' for this nigga'?

29:10.206 --> 29:14.040
- Uh, yes, please, Sean.
- No, no, I can't do it.

29:14.040 --> 29:15.261
I mean, shoot, as far as I'm concerned,

29:15.261 --> 29:16.393
you're getting what you deserve.

29:16.393 --> 29:17.226
- What?

29:21.956 --> 29:23.915
- Word?

29:32.038 --> 29:34.128
- This mother fucker.

29:34.128 --> 29:34.961
Damn!

29:47.039 --> 29:51.697
- Hey, mom, how are you?

29:51.697 --> 29:54.352
- I'm good, how about you?

29:54.352 --> 29:55.602
How's the city?

29:57.471 --> 30:00.567
- I'm good, and Atlanta's great.

30:00.567 --> 30:03.712
It's a lot faster than Macon.

30:03.712 --> 30:05.212
But, I'm adapting.

30:06.736 --> 30:07.986
So, what's new?

30:09.963 --> 30:12.169
- Well, I met someone.

30:12.169 --> 30:13.002
- What?

30:14.702 --> 30:17.035
My mother is seeing someone?

30:17.926 --> 30:19.476
Who is he?

30:19.476 --> 30:22.212
- His name is Bobby,
and I met him at church.

30:22.212 --> 30:26.981
He's a dentist, he's divorced,
he doesn't have kids.

30:26.981 --> 30:30.038
Oh, I don't know what else to say except

30:30.038 --> 30:32.788
he makes me feel alive, you know?

30:33.794 --> 30:38.211
- Aw, he sounds like a dream,
can't wait to meet him.

30:45.064 --> 30:46.731
- Hey, dad, it's me.

30:47.799 --> 30:50.049
Did you talk to the police?

30:51.183 --> 30:55.055
Thank you, I appreciate it.

30:55.055 --> 30:58.638
Alright, dad.

31:11.030 --> 31:14.972
Whatta you want?
- I think you might be right.

31:14.972 --> 31:16.117
- What are you talking about?

31:16.117 --> 31:18.326
Right about what?
- I did some asking around.

31:18.326 --> 31:20.569
I mean, nobody's seen Lance, nobody.

31:20.569 --> 31:23.472
- You did that for me?
- Of course I did.

31:23.472 --> 31:25.224
You know you're the only
woman I can love and hate

31:25.224 --> 31:26.814
at the same time.

31:26.814 --> 31:28.651
- Thanks.
- No problem.

31:28.651 --> 31:31.673
But no, for real, I
mean, nobody has any clue

31:31.673 --> 31:33.006
where he can be.

31:34.609 --> 31:37.099
- I have one.
- I'm listening.

31:37.099 --> 31:39.830
- I think she has something to do with it.

31:39.830 --> 31:41.828
- She who?
- Maxine.

31:41.828 --> 31:43.551
- You can't be serious.

31:43.551 --> 31:46.321
- Oh, I'm dead-ass serious.
- Come on, Lana,

31:46.321 --> 31:48.199
you are way in left field with this.

31:48.199 --> 31:50.211
I mean, Maxine is a straight square.

31:50.211 --> 31:51.760
I mean, she's a good looking square,

31:51.760 --> 31:53.883
but she's still a square, all the same.

31:53.883 --> 31:56.791
She wouldn't do nothin' to
Lance, she.. she adores Lance.

31:56.791 --> 31:59.159
- Naw, see, my intuition is telling me

31:59.159 --> 32:01.856
something different, though.

32:01.856 --> 32:03.322
- Alright.

32:03.322 --> 32:05.036
I mean, if it makes you feel any better,

32:05.036 --> 32:08.223
I'll go around there,
see what I can find out.

32:08.223 --> 32:09.409
- Naw, you know what?

32:09.409 --> 32:12.881
Hold that thought, I'll go.
- Why?

32:12.881 --> 32:15.695
- Because, if you go then she's gonna know

32:15.695 --> 32:17.862
his disappearance is being looked into.

32:17.862 --> 32:20.797
But if I go, I'm just another jilted lover

32:20.797 --> 32:24.797
coming over there to see
if he went back to her.

32:36.666 --> 32:38.707
- What the fuck?

32:38.707 --> 32:40.873
- Good afternoon.

32:40.873 --> 32:42.342
How'd you sleep?

32:42.342 --> 32:46.056
I know these floors can
kinda be hard on the back.

32:46.056 --> 32:48.382
- You know you can't keep me here forever.

32:48.382 --> 32:50.912
Somebody will find me.

32:50.912 --> 32:54.634
- I hate to burst your overinflated ego,

32:54.634 --> 32:58.275
but as of now, no one's
even lookin' for you.

32:58.275 --> 32:59.275
- You lyin'.

33:00.190 --> 33:02.190
- Believe what you must.

33:03.089 --> 33:05.182
- Can you at least tell
me why you're doin' this?

33:05.182 --> 33:06.943
Better yet, what you gonna do with me?

33:06.943 --> 33:11.606
- I don't know,
I haven't decided yet.

33:11.606 --> 33:13.851
Do you have any suggestions.

33:13.851 --> 33:15.769
- You're fucking psychotic.

33:15.769 --> 33:20.063
- Sticks and stones.

33:20.063 --> 33:22.390
- Help!

33:22.390 --> 33:23.557
Somebody help!

33:24.673 --> 33:27.615
- Yell all you want; the
basement is soundproof.

33:27.615 --> 33:30.317
Why do you think I
installed bells down here?

33:30.317 --> 33:31.464
- Shit!

33:40.745 --> 33:43.109
- What the hell you want?

33:43.109 --> 33:43.942
- To talk.

33:44.787 --> 33:46.789
- What is there to talk about?

33:46.789 --> 33:49.485
- Um, have you seen Lance lately?

33:49.485 --> 33:52.180
- Nope, haven't seem him
in like, a week or two.

33:52.180 --> 33:54.176
- Right, and
you didn't think to call?

33:54.176 --> 33:56.959
Find out if something
mighta happened to him?

33:56.959 --> 33:58.594
Make a police report, anything?

33:58.594 --> 34:00.762
- Nope, I assumed he been with you.

34:00.762 --> 34:02.429
- You assumed wrong.

34:10.263 --> 34:11.897
- I guess there's some pleasure in knowing

34:11.897 --> 34:13.570
that he played you, too.

34:13.570 --> 34:15.614
- He didn't play me.

34:15.614 --> 34:18.016
- That's what I
kept telling myself, too,

34:18.016 --> 34:19.889
until reality stepped in.

34:19.889 --> 34:21.812
- That's just it, you standing
here like you don't care

34:21.812 --> 34:23.362
that I'm telling you that he missing.

34:23.362 --> 34:25.605
You think it's a game, right?
- Why should I?

34:25.605 --> 34:27.034
He left me for you.

34:27.034 --> 34:29.362
A skanky little video model.
- At least I know how

34:29.362 --> 34:31.766
to satisfy him.
- Obviously not as good

34:31.766 --> 34:33.886
as you thought or he
would be with you now.

34:33.886 --> 34:38.168
And you wouldn't be here
boring the hell outta me.

34:40.699 --> 34:44.664
I'm so glad you did that.

34:47.485 --> 34:49.652
- Bitch, get the fuck off me!

34:58.023 --> 34:58.856
GET Off me!

35:09.259 --> 35:10.176
Dumb bitch!

35:51.601 --> 35:52.622
- No, no, wait!

35:52.622 --> 35:54.382
Wait, wait, wait!

36:08.228 --> 36:09.061
- Hey.

36:24.363 --> 36:26.530
What happened to your eye?

36:27.917 --> 36:30.783
- You don't even want to know.

36:30.783 --> 36:32.822
- Yes I do, that's why I'm asking.

36:32.822 --> 36:34.989
What happened to your eye?

36:35.967 --> 36:38.300
- Me and Maxine got into it.

36:39.189 --> 36:41.939
- Maxine, who the hell is Maxine?

36:42.812 --> 36:45.229
- She's Lances ex-girlfriend.

36:46.203 --> 36:50.241
- Lance's ex-girlfriend?

36:50.241 --> 36:52.741
How ex, is this ex-girlfriend?

36:54.483 --> 36:57.546
- Hmm, we were seeing each
other behind her back.

36:57.546 --> 37:00.770
- Dammit, Lana!

37:00.770 --> 37:02.610
- Look, I know, that's
why I went over there

37:02.610 --> 37:04.614
to see if she has something
to do with his disappearance.

37:04.614 --> 37:05.864
- Unbelievable!

37:06.732 --> 37:08.488
- Do you think this would be

37:08.488 --> 37:10.571
something of interest to
your friend on the force?

37:10.571 --> 37:12.615
- Yes, yes I do.

37:12.615 --> 37:14.737
But I'm not gonna tell
him and neither are you.

37:14.737 --> 37:17.596
- Why not?
- Because this love triangle

37:17.596 --> 37:19.594
that you've got yourself into,

37:19.594 --> 37:22.534
Or, if something happened to
Lance, God forbid he's dead.

37:22.534 --> 37:26.867
You're gonna be just as
much of a suspect as she is.

37:30.518 --> 37:33.116
Let me investigate this woman myself

37:33.116 --> 37:35.866
before we jump the gun, OK?
- OK.

37:37.197 --> 37:38.868

OK, I'm smiling, so what?
- So?

40:03.737 --> 40:06.030
Didn't I tell you, all you need was one night out with me?

40:06.030 --> 40:07.577
- One, one, just one.

40:08.963 --> 40:10.469
- Hi!
- Kelly!!

40:11.493 --> 40:13.812
- Mm, come here!

40:13.812 --> 40:15.441
Yeah, the dead has arise.

40:15.441 --> 40:17.728
-See bitch.. That's why I don't fuck with you.
-Yes you do with your fine ass.

40:17.728 --> 40:20.498
Sit down and gimme that dress.

40:20.498 --> 40:23.927
- What's goin' on?
- Nothin' much, I'm good.

40:23.927 --> 40:25.067
- You are?

40:25.067 --> 40:26.984
You're good?
- I'm good.

40:43.612 --> 40:47.195
Stop fighting it.

41:17.485 --> 41:20.508
- I see you haven't lost your appetite.

41:20.508 --> 41:24.715
I'm curious, is there any other appetites

41:24.715 --> 41:26.465
that need fulfilling?

41:29.248 --> 41:30.556
- You're sick.

41:30.556 --> 41:31.659
- So you're telling me

41:31.659 --> 41:34.799
you're not the least bit interested?

41:34.799 --> 41:36.638
If not for me, then who?

41:36.638 --> 41:38.472
The video bitch Lana?

41:38.472 --> 41:40.267
The one that stopped by earlier?

41:40.267 --> 41:44.473
Yeah, that's right, she came by.

41:44.473 --> 41:46.642
- Did you hurt her?
- No, but it wasn't for

41:46.642 --> 41:47.988
the lack of trying.

41:47.988 --> 41:50.602
Who knew the bitch could fight?

41:50.602 --> 41:51.435
Now,

41:52.770 --> 41:55.543
back to the question at hand.

41:55.543 --> 41:56.932
- It's not gonna happen.

41:56.932 --> 41:58.974
- Oh, it's gonna happen.

41:58.974 --> 42:00.566
You promised Maxine a baby,

42:00.566 --> 42:02.927
and I'm here to make sure she collects.

42:02.927 --> 42:04.764
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, what?

42:04.764 --> 42:07.825
I thought Maxine was already pregnant?

42:07.825 --> 42:09.989
- I'm afraid not.

42:09.989 --> 42:11.414
- Are you sure she's pregnant?

42:11.414 --> 42:12.840
- You got her pregnant, man?

42:12.840 --> 42:14.854
- If she says she's pregnant,

42:14.854 --> 42:15.854
then she is.

42:17.143 --> 42:18.775
Period.

42:18.775 --> 42:20.619
I don't believe this shit!!

42:20.619 --> 42:24.475
- Don't worry, she will be soon enough.

42:24.475 --> 42:28.249
- You actually think I'm gonna
have sex with your crazy ass?

42:28.249 --> 42:31.922
- I'm quite sure of it, I
laced your water with Viagra.

42:31.922 --> 42:33.557
You don't even have to be conscious.

42:47.749 --> 42:52.111
See, your mouth says no
while your body says yes.

43:20.207 --> 43:21.457
- Good morning!

43:22.779 --> 43:25.067
- What's so good about it?

43:25.067 --> 43:26.576
I'm never drinkin' again.

43:26.576 --> 43:29.841
- Yeah, OK, that's
what you said last time.

43:29.841 --> 43:33.174
You want some breakfast?
- Yes, starving.

43:45.443 --> 43:49.970
- What now?

44:11.498 --> 44:12.331
- Hi,

44:13.202 --> 44:14.285
Maxine?
- Yes?

44:15.161 --> 44:16.716
Who are you?

44:16.716 --> 44:19.255
- I'm Roy Stevens, I'm Lana's father.

44:19.255 --> 44:20.608
- Are you kidding me?

44:20.608 --> 44:23.265
She ran to you 'cause we
exchanged a few blows?

44:23.265 --> 44:25.223
Look, it it makes you feel any better,

44:25.223 --> 44:28.981
she gave as good as she got.
- No, no, wait please!

44:28.981 --> 44:31.024
Now, I'm not here for that.

44:31.024 --> 44:32.191
Can I come in?

44:34.935 --> 44:35.852
- Whatever.

44:42.452 --> 44:46.293
So, if it's not about the
fight, then what's it about?

44:46.293 --> 44:48.659
- Well, I was wondering if I
could ask you a few questions

44:48.659 --> 44:52.132
about Lance?
- What are you, a cop?

44:52.132 --> 44:54.210
- Well... I used to be-... I'm actually retired.

44:54.210 --> 44:58.151
- And the plot thickens.

44:58.151 --> 45:01.037
- Ah, can we have a seat?
- Yes, please.

45:01.037 --> 45:02.037
- Thank you.

45:04.996 --> 45:08.144
- So, what did you want
to know about Lance?

45:08.144 --> 45:08.977
- Um.

45:10.266 --> 45:12.515
When was the last time you seen Lance?

45:12.515 --> 45:13.944
- Um,

45:13.944 --> 45:15.829
about two weeks ago.

45:15.829 --> 45:17.339
- OK.

45:17.339 --> 45:19.625
And, what was the nature
of your conversation?

45:19.625 --> 45:21.743
If you don't mind me asking?

45:21.743 --> 45:22.993
- He's fishing.

45:24.188 --> 45:26.275
He thinks you're involved.

45:26.275 --> 45:29.275
Play it cool, take him off his game.

45:30.597 --> 45:34.195
I'm thinking you might have
to put out on this one.

45:34.195 --> 45:36.236
Nothing puts an older man off his game

45:36.236 --> 45:38.736
like a hot piece of young ass.

45:42.238 --> 45:44.364
- He said he was seein' someone else.

45:44.364 --> 45:47.963
That he was gonna break it
off after I forgave him.

45:47.963 --> 45:52.461
He left to do just that, and
I haven't seen him since.

45:52.461 --> 45:55.437
- Well, after he didn't return,

45:55.437 --> 45:57.270
did you call him?
- No.

45:58.612 --> 45:59.445
- Why not?

46:00.610 --> 46:02.446
- I figured he was with your daughter.

46:02.446 --> 46:06.611
And why chase a man that
obviously doesn't want me?

46:06.611 --> 46:08.810
- But didn't you want
some sort of closure?

46:08.810 --> 46:12.935
- This isn't my
first breakup, Mr. Stevens.

46:12.935 --> 46:15.632
It hurt, but in these
situations I've learned

46:15.632 --> 46:17.798
it's best to make a clean break.

46:17.798 --> 46:20.096
Rather than to drive yourself crazy

46:20.096 --> 46:23.696
wondering what you
coulda done differently.

46:23.696 --> 46:24.529
- I see.

46:27.904 --> 46:31.537
- You know, I remember
everything about that day.

46:31.537 --> 46:33.984
Even what he had on.

46:33.984 --> 46:35.821
- Which was?

46:35.821 --> 46:36.654
- Jeans,

46:37.740 --> 46:38.740
a white tee,

46:40.347 --> 46:42.430
designer watch set up on him.

46:42.430 --> 46:45.263
I had it inscribed, forever yours.

46:50.311 --> 46:52.642
So, an ex-police officer.

46:52.642 --> 46:56.036
I bet you have all kinds
of stories to tell?

46:56.036 --> 46:57.286
- I have a few.

46:58.857 --> 47:01.190
- Have you ever shot anyone?

47:04.527 --> 47:07.631
- Unfortunately, yes.

47:07.631 --> 47:08.813
- I wanna hear all about it.

47:08.813 --> 47:10.532
But first, let me get a drink.

47:10.532 --> 47:14.615
Would you like anything?
- No thank you, I'm fine.

47:21.766 --> 47:22.599
- So now,

47:23.630 --> 47:24.797
where were we?

47:25.832 --> 47:27.345
- Uh,

47:27.345 --> 47:30.124
um, I think I should be going.
- Why?

47:30.124 --> 47:32.897
Things were just getting interesting.

47:32.897 --> 47:35.420
- And that's why I need to be going.

47:35.420 --> 47:38.484
- You don't find me attractive?

47:38.484 --> 47:40.528
- Yes, I find you very attractive.

47:40.528 --> 47:42.490
But I'm old enough to be your father.

47:42.490 --> 47:43.740
- Now be honest....

47:44.615 --> 47:47.532
Does that scare you or turn you on?

48:27.872 --> 48:30.812
Put Molly all in his wine glass...

48:30.812 --> 48:33.510
And he ain't even know it.

49:57.900 --> 50:02.018
- We could kill her right now.

50:02.018 --> 50:07.018
And no one would ever know.

50:07.164 --> 50:09.914
We even have her dad as an alibi.

50:10.970 --> 50:12.553
I know you want to.

50:13.987 --> 50:18.029
I can feel the hatred flowing within you.

50:18.029 --> 50:18.862
But wait,

50:20.564 --> 50:22.814
that's not all I'm sensing.

50:24.560 --> 50:25.393
Intrigue.

50:29.052 --> 50:29.885
I get it.

50:31.626 --> 50:36.274
She is a tender young thing.

50:36.274 --> 50:37.774
She lives for now.

51:41.023 --> 51:43.606
- Get it together, Lana!

52:41.763 --> 52:45.779
- Where are you going?

52:45.779 --> 52:47.138
- Home.

52:47.138 --> 52:48.607
- Why?

52:48.607 --> 52:51.107
Is someone there waiting?
- No.

52:52.565 --> 52:55.572
- Then come back to bed.

52:55.572 --> 52:58.306
- Lord.

52:58.306 --> 53:00.636
I shoulda never let this happen.

53:00.636 --> 53:03.123
I'm old enough to be your father.

53:03.123 --> 53:05.451
- Why is it that a man's
regrets always comes

53:05.451 --> 53:07.784
after he gets what he wants?

53:12.667 --> 53:14.912
I hope to see you again.

53:14.912 --> 53:15.912
It was nice.

53:16.832 --> 53:19.933
I had a good time.

53:45.376 --> 53:46.893
- Stay the hell away from me.

53:46.893 --> 53:51.585
- Relax, I come in peace.

53:51.585 --> 53:53.542
I always wanted to say that.

53:53.542 --> 53:55.866
But I have good news.

53:55.866 --> 53:57.910
- If it doesn't start
with, I'm free to go,

53:57.910 --> 54:01.410
I'm not interested.
- No, but I'm pregnant.

54:02.526 --> 54:05.020
- Yeah right.
- Didn't you hear me?

54:05.020 --> 54:07.301
I'm pregnant; you're gonna be a father.

54:07.301 --> 54:09.187
- Yeah, I heard you.

54:09.187 --> 54:12.895
- You know what, you're putting
a real damper on this mood.

54:12.895 --> 54:15.145
I'm about to go take a run.

54:16.403 --> 54:17.570
- Crazy bitch.

55:49.521 --> 55:50.771
- Lance?

55:52.091 --> 55:53.764
Lance?
- Sean!

55:53.764 --> 55:54.870
What you doin' here, man?

55:54.870 --> 55:56.873
Where's Maxine?
- Damn, bro!

55:56.873 --> 55:58.996
Man, she just left, man, she just left.

55:58.996 --> 56:01.237
- Listen, she's gone crazy, bro.

56:01.237 --> 56:03.035
You better get outta here
before she gets back.

56:03.035 --> 56:04.172
- No, I should leave you down here

56:04.172 --> 56:05.853
for even messin' with my
ex in the first place.

56:05.853 --> 56:07.076
- Man, come on all that.

56:07.076 --> 56:08.543
Man, get me out these cuffs.

56:08.543 --> 56:10.126
- I got you.

56:20.008 --> 56:23.479
This ain't workin', man.

56:23.479 --> 56:24.824
- Listen, listen, listen.

56:24.824 --> 56:26.257
You gotta get something
to cut these chains, man.

56:26.257 --> 56:28.303
Go get a rod.
- I'll be right back.

56:28.303 --> 56:29.723
You know the only reason you
got her in the first place

56:29.723 --> 56:31.316
is 'cause of your money, right?

56:31.316 --> 56:34.175
- Man, come on,
man, shit, man, come on!

56:40.210 --> 56:42.006
- Maxine!

56:48.499 --> 56:50.336
- Sean, you find anything?

56:50.336 --> 56:53.487
- Yes, an intruder.

56:53.487 --> 56:54.669
- Where's Sean?

56:54.669 --> 56:55.854
- Upstairs.

56:55.854 --> 56:58.430
- What the fuck you do?

56:58.430 --> 57:00.515
- What I had to.

57:00.515 --> 57:02.104
- You better hope I don't get outta here.

57:02.104 --> 57:05.079
- And you better hope I
don't lose my patience.

57:05.079 --> 57:06.162
- Oh, my God.

57:08.115 --> 57:10.356
This can't be happening.

57:10.356 --> 57:11.606
You killed him.

57:13.624 --> 57:16.937
Can't believe you did this.

57:19.590 --> 57:21.345
Where are you?

57:21.345 --> 57:22.512
Show yourself.

57:23.993 --> 57:25.326
- I'm over here.

57:28.489 --> 57:29.322
That's it.

57:30.613 --> 57:32.446
You're getting closer.

57:33.643 --> 57:34.476
Over here.

57:37.146 --> 57:38.646
Stop your whining.

57:39.515 --> 57:42.130
He was gonna ruin everything.

57:42.130 --> 57:44.215
It had to be done.

57:44.215 --> 57:46.583
Now, pull yourself together.

57:46.583 --> 57:48.992
'Cause there's work that has to be done.

57:48.992 --> 57:50.581
You

57:50.581 --> 57:52.994
have to get rid of the body.

57:52.994 --> 57:55.563
- No, I can't.

57:55.563 --> 57:57.152
I don't know how!

57:57.152 --> 57:59.069
And what if I'm caught?

58:00.419 --> 58:02.505
- You won't be caught.

58:02.505 --> 58:06.907
Wait until nightfall, drive the
body to an isolated location

58:06.907 --> 58:08.407
and torch the car.

59:22.883 --> 59:24.640
- Well, it's about time you stopped by.

59:24.640 --> 59:27.252
I've been trying to get in
touch with you for two days.

59:27.252 --> 59:28.236
- Baby, I'm sorry,

59:28.236 --> 59:30.112
I've just been busy.

59:30.112 --> 59:31.416
- Busy?

59:31.416 --> 59:33.047
You're a retired police officer.

59:33.047 --> 59:34.804
What's more important than your daughter?

59:34.804 --> 59:36.108
I've been going crazy out of my mind

59:36.108 --> 59:37.945
trying to get in touch with you.

59:37.945 --> 59:41.657
- Well, I'm here now, and
as you can see, I'm fine.

59:41.657 --> 59:44.272
- OK, well, you were
supposed to go see Maxine.

59:44.272 --> 59:46.026
So, did you?

59:46.026 --> 59:49.109
- Yeah, I did.
- And what did she say?

59:51.453 --> 59:52.786
- She said that,

59:54.511 --> 59:58.067
she said that Lance admitted
to the affair between you two.

59:58.067 --> 59:59.453
- Right.
- Then she said that he was

59:59.453 --> 01:00:01.489
on his way here to break up with you,

01:00:01.489 --> 01:00:04.468
and that's the last time she saw 'em.

01:00:04.468 --> 01:00:05.635
- She's lying.

01:00:06.755 --> 01:00:07.980
- See, you're saying that because that's

01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:09.621
what you wanna believe.

01:00:09.621 --> 01:00:12.644
- Don't tell me you believe her, dad?

01:00:12.644 --> 01:00:16.192
- Look, honey, I've been an officer for

01:00:16.192 --> 01:00:17.525
many years.
- OK.

01:00:18.404 --> 01:00:20.119
- And if she's,

01:00:20.119 --> 01:00:24.243
she's either a damn good
liar, or she has no clue

01:00:24.243 --> 01:00:26.605
about what happened to Lance.

01:00:26.605 --> 01:00:28.522
- I can't believe this.

01:00:36.573 --> 01:00:38.573
- This is Lance's watch.

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:42.073
- It is Lance's watch.

01:00:43.391 --> 01:00:45.105
- She said he was wearing that watch

01:00:45.105 --> 01:00:47.272
the last time she saw 'em.

01:00:48.657 --> 01:00:51.684
When he was supposed to
come break it off with you.

01:00:51.684 --> 01:00:52.986
- What are you trying to say?

01:00:52.986 --> 01:00:55.848
You think I had something to
do with his disappearance?

01:00:55.848 --> 01:00:57.521
- Did you?
- Really, dad?

01:00:57.521 --> 01:00:59.240
I can't believe you just asked me that.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:00.179
- I mean,

01:01:00.179 --> 01:01:01.814
I'm sorry but I have to.

01:01:01.814 --> 01:01:03.689
I mean, look, this looks bad.
- I don't give a fuck

01:01:03.689 --> 01:01:08.384
what this looks like, I
didn't do shit to Lance!

01:01:08.384 --> 01:01:09.467
She did this.

01:01:10.469 --> 01:01:11.302
- Who?

01:01:11.302 --> 01:01:13.131
- Maxine.

01:01:13.131 --> 01:01:15.378
No, really, two days ago
I was layin' in the bed

01:01:15.378 --> 01:01:18.598
and I felt like somebody was
standing over me, staring at me

01:01:18.598 --> 01:01:21.255
and I walked around the house
and I couldn't find nobody.

01:01:21.255 --> 01:01:23.218
But you know what?

01:01:23.218 --> 01:01:25.670
I know she did this.
- It couldn't have been her.

01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:27.260
- And what makes you so sure?

01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:30.728
- Because two days ago
I was questioning her.

01:01:30.728 --> 01:01:31.561
- Okay?

01:01:32.403 --> 01:01:34.491
And that was well after 12 o'clock so,

01:01:34.491 --> 01:01:38.329
how can you account for her whereabouts?

01:01:38.329 --> 01:01:40.252
No?

01:01:40.252 --> 01:01:41.848
Tell me you didn't?

01:01:41.848 --> 01:01:44.701
- Honey, look, alright
just relax, 'cause--

01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:46.209
- How could you, you fucked her?

01:01:46.209 --> 01:01:47.229
Really?
- Just calm--

01:01:47.229 --> 01:01:50.742
Calm!

01:01:50.742 --> 01:01:51.760
Baby I'm sorry.
- You know what?

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.071
No, get the fuck out!

01:01:53.071 --> 01:01:54.071
Get out, go!

01:02:09.987 --> 01:02:11.006
- In local news,

01:02:11.006 --> 01:02:14.139
Saint Clemonsfield's own
promoted officer Richard Dickit

01:02:14.139 --> 01:02:16.017
has been reported missing.

01:02:16.017 --> 01:02:18.341
Dickit was last seen at
the Saint Clemonsfield--

01:02:18.341 --> 01:02:19.645
- Oh, good morning.

01:02:19.645 --> 01:02:20.952
- Yes.

01:02:20.952 --> 01:02:23.564
- Don't forget, Morgan's comin'
by to stay a couple of days

01:02:23.564 --> 01:02:26.108
with us while she's getting
work done on her house.

01:02:26.108 --> 01:02:28.236
- Hmm, you'd look good with that.

01:02:28.236 --> 01:02:29.337
- Oh yeah?

01:02:29.337 --> 01:02:30.522
- Yeah.

01:02:30.522 --> 01:02:32.476
- So, you're like, checkin' me out?

01:02:32.476 --> 01:02:33.985
- For sure.

01:02:33.985 --> 01:02:36.438
- Don't start nothin' you can't finish.

01:02:36.438 --> 01:02:38.230
You know, with your headache and all.

01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:40.483
- Headache's

01:02:40.483 --> 01:02:41.826
all gone.

01:02:41.826 --> 01:02:43.621
We might wanna take
advantage of this time,

01:02:43.621 --> 01:02:46.232
since your girl gonna be
around for the next few days.

01:02:46.232 --> 01:02:47.982
You know what I mean?

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:49.807
- Hmm, bye.

01:02:53.541 --> 01:02:55.668
- Police
believe it to be bath salts,

01:02:55.668 --> 01:02:59.482
remanufactured and put
out in a town up north.

01:03:01.123 --> 01:03:02.635

Completely useless after sex.

01:04:20.546 --> 01:04:23.000
- Hello?
- Hey, girl.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.280
- Hey, Morgan, what's up?

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:27.203
- Nothing much, just making
sure you haven't forgotten

01:04:27.203 --> 01:04:30.846
I'm coming in today.
- No, I haven't forgotten.

01:04:30.846 --> 01:04:32.558
I'm actually looking forward to it.

01:04:32.558 --> 01:04:34.764
- Me, too, it's been too long.

01:04:34.764 --> 01:04:37.597
We got a lot of catching up to do.

01:04:40.862 --> 01:04:44.096
Brenda?
- Yeah, I'm still here.

01:04:44.096 --> 01:04:46.461
Look, if I'm not here by
the time you get here,

01:04:46.461 --> 01:04:48.791
let yourself in, the key
will be under the mat.

01:04:48.791 --> 01:04:51.775
I have to meet with a homegirl
later on this afternoon.

01:04:51.775 --> 01:04:54.592
Got some things I really need to clear up.

01:04:54.592 --> 01:04:57.782
- Mm, that sounds
serious, is everything OK?

01:04:57.782 --> 01:05:02.679
- Yeah, I'm fine, it's just
something that's long overdue.

01:05:02.679 --> 01:05:05.377
- OK, well, I'll see you later.

01:05:05.377 --> 01:05:06.559
- OK.

01:05:06.559 --> 01:05:09.392
Bye.

01:05:44.914 --> 01:05:46.219
- Hey!

01:05:46.219 --> 01:05:47.052
- Hey.

01:05:49.317 --> 01:05:50.707
- Can I come in?

01:05:50.707 --> 01:05:53.114
Or are you just gonna keep
standing there gawking at me?

01:05:53.114 --> 01:05:55.198
- Yeah, come on, I'm sorry.

01:05:55.198 --> 01:05:57.648
You just caught me by surprise.

01:05:57.648 --> 01:05:59.525
What brings you by?

01:05:59.525 --> 01:06:01.895
- Well, I just wanted to
come and check on you.

01:06:01.895 --> 01:06:03.978
I know I dropped the
bomb a couple days ago

01:06:03.978 --> 01:06:06.139
when I told you about Lana and Lance.

01:06:06.139 --> 01:06:08.549
And with him being missing,
I just thought you could

01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:11.132
use a friend.
- Thanks, come on.

01:06:21.331 --> 01:06:25.134
- I was worried about you.
- Thanks, but I'm good.

01:06:25.134 --> 01:06:27.386
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, he was seein'

01:06:27.386 --> 01:06:30.661
another woman, why should
I be concerned about him?

01:06:30.661 --> 01:06:32.585
- You gotta be feeling something, Max?

01:06:32.585 --> 01:06:36.502
- I mean, yeah, I'll admit, in
the beginning, I was a wreck.

01:06:36.502 --> 01:06:38.864
Hell, it still hurts now.

01:06:38.864 --> 01:06:41.557
I'm getting over it, though.

01:06:41.557 --> 01:06:43.974
How's Mike?
- He's doin' good.

01:06:44.823 --> 01:06:46.622
He's out of town right now, though.

01:06:46.622 --> 01:06:49.233
- Ah, that explains it.

01:06:49.233 --> 01:06:51.411
- Explains what?
- Why you'd rather be here

01:06:51.411 --> 01:06:56.411
with me on a beautiful day
like today rather than him.

01:06:56.476 --> 01:06:59.090
- Even if he was in town,
I would still be right here

01:06:59.090 --> 01:07:00.673
checking up on you.

01:07:15.604 --> 01:07:17.354
- Oh, hey, Mike.
- Hey.

01:07:17.354 --> 01:07:18.187
Hey?

01:07:19.189 --> 01:07:21.542
You know that Brenda will
probably be really upset

01:07:21.542 --> 01:07:23.174
seeing you walking around here like that.

01:07:23.174 --> 01:07:24.522
You know that, right?

01:07:24.522 --> 01:07:28.239
- You're probably right, she has
always been jealous of me.

01:07:28.239 --> 01:07:30.164
But what about you, Mike?

01:07:30.164 --> 01:07:31.331
Are you upset?

01:07:34.983 --> 01:07:35.816
- No.

01:07:37.268 --> 01:07:39.768
Girl!

01:07:55.092 --> 01:07:56.509

- Brenda, what is it?

01:08:42.142 --> 01:08:44.264
You look like you have
the weight of the world

01:08:44.264 --> 01:08:45.764
on your shoulders.

01:08:46.996 --> 01:08:49.234
- I have a confession to make.

01:08:49.234 --> 01:08:50.068
- Okay?

01:08:50.952 --> 01:08:54.627
- I'm actually glad it's over
with between you and Lance.

01:08:54.627 --> 01:08:56.015
- And why is that?

01:08:56.015 --> 01:08:58.874
- Because you're too kind
and generous of a person

01:08:58.874 --> 01:09:01.979
for someone who could
never fully appreciate you.

01:09:01.979 --> 01:09:02.812
- Thanks!

01:09:03.652 --> 01:09:05.617
- I wouldn't be too quick to thank me,

01:09:05.617 --> 01:09:08.712
because there's more, and
you're not gonna like it.

01:09:08.712 --> 01:09:12.212
- What is it, you're starting to scare me.

01:09:13.729 --> 01:09:14.831
- You remember last year when

01:09:14.831 --> 01:09:16.920
Mike and I were having problems?

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:20.068
- How could I forget, you was a wreck.

01:09:20.068 --> 01:09:23.912
- Yeah, well, with all that was going on,

01:09:23.912 --> 01:09:28.203
I felt incredibly lonely
and needed comfort.

01:09:28.203 --> 01:09:32.120
And Lance provided
me with that comfort.

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:34.814
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:09:34.814 --> 01:09:37.961
You tellin' me you and
Lance slept together?

01:09:37.961 --> 01:09:40.461
- Yes.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.305
- I cannot believe this.
- I know.

01:09:45.305 --> 01:09:47.638
I can't believe this either.

01:09:48.493 --> 01:09:50.986
I was just in such a bad place.

01:09:50.986 --> 01:09:55.230
If I wasn't, I don't believe
I woulda ever betrayed you.

01:09:55.230 --> 01:09:58.784
Do you think you can ever forgive me?

01:09:58.784 --> 01:10:01.284
- Of course I can.
- Thank you.

01:10:04.094 --> 01:10:06.511
- Who else knows you're here?

01:10:17.035 --> 01:10:19.732
I'm glad we had this talk.

01:10:19.732 --> 01:10:20.899
How 'bout you?

01:10:32.502 --> 01:10:34.586
How many bitches did you cheat on me with?

01:10:39.076 --> 01:10:40.262
- Will do everything they can

01:10:40.262 --> 01:10:42.020
to keep their distance from me.

01:10:44.109 --> 01:10:46.399
Who've been through the pain

01:10:46.399 --> 01:10:49.649
of losing someone they loved to cancer.

01:10:50.688 --> 01:10:52.201
I don't wanna be reminded of it so.

01:10:53.804 --> 01:10:55.096
They avoid me.

01:10:55.096 --> 01:10:57.013
Just like you're doing.

01:10:58.889 --> 01:10:59.972
I understand.

01:12:43.896 --> 01:12:45.241
- Evening, Roy.

01:12:45.241 --> 01:12:46.634
- Hey.

01:12:46.634 --> 01:12:48.193
- So why the hell did you
drag me all the way out here

01:12:48.193 --> 01:12:50.026
at this time of night?

01:12:51.628 --> 01:12:53.461
- Hey, I need a favor.

01:12:54.732 --> 01:12:56.968
Hey, how far are you along in that

01:12:56.968 --> 01:12:58.385
Lance Mills case?

01:13:00.002 --> 01:13:01.758
- To be honest with you, not far at all.

01:13:01.758 --> 01:13:03.008
Why do you ask?

01:13:03.844 --> 01:13:06.761
- Good, I need it to stay unsolved.

01:13:08.425 --> 01:13:11.508
- You want me to burry the case, why?

01:13:14.869 --> 01:13:15.702
Aw, God.

01:13:17.236 --> 01:13:20.319
You think Lana's involved, don't you?

01:13:22.303 --> 01:13:24.180
Well, look, Roy, I don't
know what to tell you.

01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:25.243
I'm done with all that shit,

01:13:25.243 --> 01:13:26.962
you shoulda known that before
you called me out here.

01:13:26.962 --> 01:13:29.819
So I don't know what you--
- Paul, let me!

01:13:29.819 --> 01:13:32.557
Look, see, I done helped your ass out

01:13:32.557 --> 01:13:34.964
when I was on the force, I
kept you outta the office.

01:13:34.964 --> 01:13:36.513
Remember?

01:13:36.513 --> 01:13:39.175
This is my baby girl, man!

01:13:39.175 --> 01:13:41.660
I just need one favor
from you, man, one solid!

01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:42.910
- Alright, Roy.

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.276
I'll do this one last time for you.

01:13:46.276 --> 01:13:48.276
After that, lose my fucking number.

01:14:10.806 --> 01:14:14.403
- Daddy, stop it, no!

01:14:14.403 --> 01:14:16.040
- Maxine!

01:14:38.475 --> 01:14:40.193
- Round two?

01:14:40.193 --> 01:14:44.160
- No, I come in peace.

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.755
I'm sorry, I always wanted to say that.

01:14:45.755 --> 01:14:47.678
It's an old SCI FI classic.

01:14:47.678 --> 01:14:50.125
- I know, it's one of my favorite flicks.

01:14:50.125 --> 01:14:52.166
- Really?
- Yes.

01:14:52.166 --> 01:14:54.334
- Well, can I come in.
- Yeah, come on.

01:14:54.334 --> 01:14:57.751
- Thank you.

01:15:04.887 --> 01:15:06.054
- Have a seat.

01:15:09.052 --> 01:15:11.495
So, if this ain't to throw hands,

01:15:11.495 --> 01:15:13.617
what you doin' here?

01:15:13.617 --> 01:15:16.878
- Honestly, I don't know.

01:15:16.878 --> 01:15:20.712
I mean, I was driving around
thinking about Lance and,

01:15:20.712 --> 01:15:22.883
I guess I found myself here.

01:15:22.883 --> 01:15:25.550
Or, maybe I wanted to apologize.

01:15:26.434 --> 01:15:27.351
- For what?

01:15:28.679 --> 01:15:33.679
- For coming in between you
and Lance's relationship.

01:15:33.856 --> 01:15:36.685
Or, blaming you for the disappearance.

01:15:36.685 --> 01:15:38.691
Either way, take your pick,

01:15:38.691 --> 01:15:39.941
but I am sorry.

01:15:41.061 --> 01:15:44.063
- Wow, I know it hurts to say.
- Girl!

01:15:44.063 --> 01:15:46.271
You don't even know.

01:15:46.271 --> 01:15:49.255
But, there is something
I wanna ask you, though.

01:15:49.255 --> 01:15:52.559
- What's that?
- Are you really pregnant?

01:15:52.559 --> 01:15:53.392
- Yes.

01:15:54.231 --> 01:15:55.495
- OK.

01:15:55.495 --> 01:15:59.004
Well, in your defense, last
time I talked to Lance,

01:15:59.004 --> 01:16:00.968
he told me if you said you was pregnant

01:16:00.968 --> 01:16:03.175
then it was the truth.

01:16:03.175 --> 01:16:06.758
I really miss him.

01:16:20.167 --> 01:16:21.167
- I'm sorry.

01:16:22.496 --> 01:16:24.984
- Nah, don't worry about it.

01:16:24.984 --> 01:16:27.594
- No, I shouldn't have done that.

01:16:27.594 --> 01:16:29.145
- Well, why did you?

01:16:29.145 --> 01:16:32.531
- I don't know, maybe it's
because you're the only one

01:16:32.531 --> 01:16:35.308
that can understand the
loss that I'm feeling.

01:16:35.308 --> 01:16:40.250
Or, maybe because, other than
this child that I'm carrying,

01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:42.580
you're the only real
connection that I have

01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:45.080
to the man that we both loved.

01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:51.717
Or maybe, I just find you incredibly hot.

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:06.704
What's wrong?

01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:10.685
- I've never done this before.

01:17:10.685 --> 01:17:11.518
- Relax.

01:17:13.219 --> 01:17:14.469
I'll be gentle.

01:17:33.145 --> 01:17:35.228
You want me to stop?
- Fuck no!

01:19:28.233 --> 01:19:30.206
Hey, what just happened?

01:19:30.206 --> 01:19:31.456
- We made love.

01:19:33.717 --> 01:19:36.251
- This was a mistake.
- No, it wasn't.

01:19:36.251 --> 01:19:37.668
It was beautiful.

01:19:38.618 --> 01:19:40.451
I counted two orgasms.

01:19:41.885 --> 01:19:43.727
There were probably others,

01:19:43.727 --> 01:19:47.727
but you kept quiet so I
wouldn't get a big head.

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:54.273
- Hey.

01:19:55.235 --> 01:19:56.068
- Yeah?

01:19:57.479 --> 01:19:59.974
- There were others.

01:20:12.405 --> 01:20:14.857
- What the hell you lookin' at?

01:20:14.857 --> 01:20:15.940
- An asshole.

01:20:16.779 --> 01:20:18.252
I don't get it.

01:20:18.252 --> 01:20:20.857
Why would Maxine wanna
waste two years of her life

01:20:20.857 --> 01:20:23.520
with a piece of shit like you?

01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:25.727
- Sticks and stones.

01:20:25.727 --> 01:20:26.560
- Touche'.

01:20:28.174 --> 01:20:31.623
Just so you know, Lana still misses you.

01:20:31.623 --> 01:20:33.421
- You spoke with Lana?

01:20:33.421 --> 01:20:34.890
- Yeah.

01:20:34.890 --> 01:20:36.154
- When?

01:20:36.154 --> 01:20:37.987
- She spent the night.

01:20:39.952 --> 01:20:41.378
- Why would Lana come here?

01:20:41.378 --> 01:20:44.028
Especially since the first
time didn't go too well.

01:20:44.028 --> 01:20:46.431
- That's the funny thing.

01:20:46.431 --> 01:20:49.942
She came by apologizing for suspecting me

01:20:49.942 --> 01:20:52.547
to have something to do
with your disappearance.

01:20:52.547 --> 01:20:56.130
Ironic, isn't it?

01:21:00.087 --> 01:21:01.170
We made love.

01:21:02.536 --> 01:21:04.827
- Yeah right!

01:21:04.827 --> 01:21:08.341
- I can see why you like her,
she's as sweet as a peach.

01:21:11.404 --> 01:21:13.885
I can see that that bothers you.

01:21:13.885 --> 01:21:16.335
But I can't help but wonder,

01:21:16.335 --> 01:21:19.606
is it the thought of her leaving?

01:21:19.606 --> 01:21:23.242
Or is it the thought
of me making her scream

01:21:23.242 --> 01:21:26.143
more than you ever could?
- You bitch!

01:21:26.143 --> 01:21:27.898
- Good bye, Lance.

01:21:27.898 --> 01:21:31.659
It seems that you've
outlived your usefulness.

01:21:31.659 --> 01:21:33.702
- So, you just gonna kill me?

01:21:33.702 --> 01:21:34.535
- Yeah.

01:21:36.404 --> 01:21:38.405
- You're not gonna get away with this.

01:21:38.405 --> 01:21:42.526
- Don't underestimate the
criminally insane, Lance.

01:21:42.526 --> 01:21:46.158
We're quite brilliant.

01:21:46.158 --> 01:21:51.103
We only get caught if it's
our intention to get caught.

01:21:51.103 --> 01:21:52.787
If it makes you feel any better,

01:21:52.787 --> 01:21:57.117
Maxine is real conflicted
about killing you.

01:21:57.117 --> 01:21:59.784
Unfortunately, for you, I'm not.

01:22:17.444 --> 01:22:19.241
- Relax, baby girl..

01:22:19.241 --> 01:22:21.734
Every girl gotta go anal sometime, right?

01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:29.183
- Kill him, Max!

01:22:43.175 --> 01:22:45.925
- Max, what did you do?

01:22:57.714 --> 01:22:58.714
- It's done.

01:22:59.593 --> 01:23:01.313
Time for me to go.

01:23:01.313 --> 01:23:02.663
- Wait!

01:23:02.663 --> 01:23:05.600
There's something else
that needs to be done.

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:08.718
- Nah, I can't help you with that.

01:23:08.718 --> 01:23:12.233
You're dealin' with too
many regrets from your past.

01:23:12.233 --> 01:23:13.816
I don't do regrets.

01:23:15.792 --> 01:23:17.459
I'll see you around.

01:23:44.293 --> 01:23:46.576
- Maxine, you've been
sitting there for 15 minutes

01:23:46.576 --> 01:23:48.220
and you haven't said a word.

01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:49.321
You know I can't help you

01:23:49.321 --> 01:23:52.095
if you don't tell me what's going on.

01:23:52.095 --> 01:23:57.095
- Even though you're bound by
doctor/client confidentiality

01:23:57.324 --> 01:23:59.173
there's still things you have to report

01:23:59.173 --> 01:24:02.322
to the authorities, correct?

01:24:02.322 --> 01:24:03.918
- Yes.

01:24:03.918 --> 01:24:07.267
- Well, I'm gonna give you
a hypothetical situation,

01:24:07.267 --> 01:24:09.470
just to see what you think.

01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:11.762
- OK
- Hypothetically,

01:24:11.762 --> 01:24:15.150
what if a patient of yours
killed her stepfather

01:24:15.150 --> 01:24:17.805
for sexually abusing her for years?

01:24:17.805 --> 01:24:21.067
And what if her brother
is now on death row

01:24:21.067 --> 01:24:23.881
because he took the blame for that murder?

01:24:23.881 --> 01:24:26.455
All because he felt guilty for not seeing

01:24:26.455 --> 01:24:28.988
what was going on right
underneath his nose

01:24:28.988 --> 01:24:31.360
and doing something about it.

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.731
What do you think would happen to her?

01:24:33.731 --> 01:24:37.248
And what do you think would
happen to her brother?

01:24:37.248 --> 01:24:41.080
- Well, if she admitted to the murder,

01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:42.715
and her brother were to confirm the story,

01:24:42.715 --> 01:24:44.552
I'm sure that courts would reopen the case

01:24:44.552 --> 01:24:46.550
and he'd be released.

01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:49.086
- And what about the patient?

01:24:49.086 --> 01:24:51.218
- Well, if that patient
were a patient of mine

01:24:51.218 --> 01:24:53.948
I'm sure I could testify
to the effects that

01:24:53.948 --> 01:24:56.856
the abuse had on her
mentally and emotionally.

01:24:56.856 --> 01:25:00.456
Also, my husband being the
D.A., I'm sure we could get her

01:25:00.456 --> 01:25:02.619
committed to a psychiatric hospital

01:25:02.619 --> 01:25:05.033
so that she can get the help she needs

01:25:05.033 --> 01:25:08.670
instead of serving a
lengthy jail sentence.

01:25:08.670 --> 01:25:11.039
And I'm also pretty sure
that I can get her released

01:25:11.039 --> 01:25:13.040
from that mental hospital before her baby

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:15.330
has the chance to call anyone else mommy.

01:25:15.330 --> 01:25:17.779
Hypothetically speaking.

01:25:17.779 --> 01:25:20.612
- How did you know I was pregnant?

01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:25.993
- Maxine, is there
anything you wanna tell me?

01:25:25.993 --> 01:25:30.993
- wanna confess to
the murder of my stepfather,

01:26:08.770 --> 01:26:10.937

01:26:56.664 --> 01:27:00.070
What is it that you're expecting?

01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:01.747
- I'm not expecting anything.

01:27:01.747 --> 01:27:04.561
I just wanna know my mother.

01:27:04.561 --> 01:27:08.441
- Don't call me that;
I am not your mother.

01:27:08.441 --> 01:27:10.279
- Yes you are.

01:27:10.279 --> 01:27:13.145
How could you sit there
and say that to me?

01:27:13.145 --> 01:27:16.986
What about me being
here makes you so angry?

01:27:16.986 --> 01:27:20.494
- Because every time I
look at you I think of him.

01:27:20.494 --> 01:27:22.411
- Who, my father?
- Yes.

01:27:25.566 --> 01:27:26.566
- Who is he?

01:27:27.403 --> 01:27:31.041
What did he do to make
you so angry with him?

01:27:31.041 --> 01:27:32.208
- He raped me.

01:27:34.503 --> 01:27:36.786
- Oh... Oh my God.

01:27:36.786 --> 01:27:39.194
- That's right, your father, he raped me.

01:27:39.194 --> 01:27:41.072
And every time I look at you,

01:27:41.072 --> 01:27:43.642
it brings back all these painful memories.

01:27:43.642 --> 01:27:46.059
I've tried so hard to forget.

01:27:48.007 --> 01:27:48.924
Please, go.

01:27:51.477 --> 01:27:54.394
- I'm sorry, but I'm not my father.

01:27:55.639 --> 01:27:58.782
Please don't push me away, I
just want to get to know you.

01:27:58.782 --> 01:28:01.145
- I can't give you what you want, Reese.

01:28:01.145 --> 01:28:03.805
As far as I'm concerned,
I only have two kids.

01:28:03.805 --> 01:28:05.472
Nicholas and Maxine.

01:28:06.782 --> 01:28:09.282
Please go and don't come back.

01:28:12.378 --> 01:28:14.459
- If you hated me so much.

01:28:14.459 --> 01:28:17.317
Why bother even having me?

01:28:17.317 --> 01:28:19.107
- If it were up to me, I would've gotten

01:28:19.107 --> 01:28:22.573
an abortion as soon as I
found out I was pregnant.

01:28:22.573 --> 01:28:25.389
But my parents are devout Christians and,

01:28:25.389 --> 01:28:28.389
an abortion was out of the question.

01:28:36.677 --> 01:28:40.927
- Hell, girl,
what's taking you so long?

01:28:50.792 --> 01:28:52.292
