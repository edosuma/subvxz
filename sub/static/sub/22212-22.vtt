00:08.258 --> 00:11.052
<i>Previously on </i>Riverdale<i>:</i>
-My dad was the Black Hood.

00:11.136 --> 00:14.222
-He tried to shoot my dad.
Impossible. He was with us.

00:14.305 --> 00:16.558
I rearranged Nick St. Clair's
pretty-boy face.

00:16.641 --> 00:19.936
When some hillbilly threatened
Mr. Lodge's daughter, I did the same.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.355
-Andre.

00:22.439 --> 00:26.317
-The fire's started. Chaos is good for us.
-A new sheriff's taken over for Keller.

00:26.401 --> 00:29.320
-A man I know well. Michael Minetta.
For all of Mr. Lodge's talk

00:29.404 --> 00:31.197
about order,
he was nowhere to be seen.

00:31.281 --> 00:34.242
Don't get between me and my dad.
You'll lose.

00:34.325 --> 00:38.288
This is from when I turned the tables
on Nick. His parents gave me a million.

00:38.371 --> 00:41.583
I put it in a trust
you won't touch until you're 21.

00:41.666 --> 00:45.503
You paid the Ghoulies and Penny
to go to war with the Serpents?

00:45.587 --> 00:47.922
How much is this costing?
I have a counter-offer.

00:48.006 --> 00:50.675
I hand myself over,
there's no bloodshed.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.927
You're a true hero, Jughead.

00:53.011 --> 00:56.806
Let your dying thought be
that your sacrifice was for nothing.

01:14.449 --> 01:15.742
Come back to me, Jug.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.871
We're not done yet. You hear me?

01:19.954 --> 01:23.291
Our story's not over. It's just beginning.

01:25.543 --> 01:27.045
So, you come back to me.

01:27.670 --> 01:28.505
<i>Okay?</i>

01:33.843 --> 01:34.969
Dad.

01:37.931 --> 01:38.807
Jug.

01:43.394 --> 01:44.395
What did I miss?

01:45.271 --> 01:48.900
What you did brought every Serpent
out of the woodwork.

01:48.983 --> 01:50.527
You would've been proud.

01:51.903 --> 01:55.073
It looked like we were gonna win,
but in the end, there were just--

01:55.615 --> 01:57.033
Just too many Ghoulies.

01:58.493 --> 02:01.955
-It was like shooting snakes in a barrel.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.292
-To avenge you.

02:06.376 --> 02:10.213
-I had an agreement with Hiram.
-There was no stopping the others.

02:10.296 --> 02:13.842
They were churned up about you and Fangs.
Even though Fangs--

02:13.925 --> 02:16.344
-He's alive.

02:17.470 --> 02:18.388
But I thought...

02:21.057 --> 02:23.226
A deputy told you he was dead?

02:23.309 --> 02:26.437
-Yeah, that was a lie.
-A ploy, you mean.

02:26.521 --> 02:29.190
To goad the Serpents
into a fight they couldn't win.

02:29.274 --> 02:32.902
All of Riot Night
was a Hiram Lodge-orchestrated mousetrap.

02:36.072 --> 02:38.158
The Serpents followed me into it.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.909
Sunnyside Trailer Park fell.

02:40.743 --> 02:43.663
Our trailer's still standing.
Most of them burned.

02:47.959 --> 02:48.793
Jug.

02:48.877 --> 02:52.338
After the rumble,
some of the Serpents defected. They--

02:53.172 --> 02:55.884
They joined the Ghoulies.
Others were arrested.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.094
More went into hiding. The rest...

02:59.554 --> 03:00.889
They left town.

03:02.765 --> 03:06.477
The Serpents... they don't exist anymore.

03:06.728 --> 03:10.273
We had our time.
Nothing for you to do but to get better.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.734
-And to be there for Betty.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.194
What happened with Betty?

03:20.575 --> 03:23.411
I'm so sorry that I wasn't there for you.

03:25.371 --> 03:26.706
To help with your dad.

03:26.789 --> 03:28.750
No, Jug.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.379
I never wanna see him again.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.386
Right now, all I care about is you.

03:40.970 --> 03:43.097
And taking care of my mom.

03:46.726 --> 03:49.062
And figuring out how to...

03:49.812 --> 03:53.441
atone for all of the horrible things
my father did.

03:56.444 --> 03:59.530
So, I guess we won't be running
for student council.

04:00.156 --> 04:02.075
Probably not.

04:09.707 --> 04:12.460
<i>Here's your schedule</i>
<i>for the next three days.</i>

04:12.543 --> 04:16.422
My mom's doing
an Eva Peron-like "Rainbow Tour."

04:16.965 --> 04:19.801
Shaking the trees before election night.

04:19.884 --> 04:23.012
I took the liberty of booking you
right behind her,

04:23.096 --> 04:24.681
so people know they have a choice.

04:24.764 --> 04:28.476
Well, I appreciate that, Veronica,
for what it's worth, but...

04:29.519 --> 04:33.314
Everybody's saying your parents
saved Riverdale after the riot.

04:33.398 --> 04:37.902
It was their guy, Minetta,
who rounded up the guilty parties.

04:37.986 --> 04:41.364
We know the truth.
Mr. Lodge doesn't wanna save the town.

04:41.447 --> 04:45.827
-He wants to take it over.
-I won't rest until you're elected mayor.

04:45.910 --> 04:50.081
Even if it means I have to put
my own political ambitions aside.

04:50.331 --> 04:51.541
In what respect?

04:51.624 --> 04:54.252
I'm no longer running with Archie.

04:54.335 --> 04:57.463
Conspiring against my parents
is a full-time job.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.220
Hey, Betty. Any news?

05:04.762 --> 05:07.974
-I'll be out first thing tomorrow.
-That's good, Jug.

05:08.057 --> 05:11.185
We still need your brain.
There's another mystery.

05:13.187 --> 05:17.775
Mr. Cooper was at the town hall when some
other Black Hood shot at the candidates.

05:17.859 --> 05:21.112
He was at home with Betty
when another Black Hood,

05:21.195 --> 05:24.824
probably the same as the one at the
town hall, came after me and my dad, so...

05:24.907 --> 05:27.994
The second Black Hood's attacks,
at the town hall and on your dad,

05:28.077 --> 05:30.288
seem to indicate a political motive.

05:30.371 --> 05:34.250
-Which to me, suggests--

05:34.334 --> 05:35.335
I don't disagree.

05:35.418 --> 05:39.047
With Fred out of the way,
my mother's victory is assured.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.758
So, if we're gonna stop Hiram,
we've gotta do it now.

05:41.883 --> 05:45.219
Once the Lodges control the mayor,
they'll be untouchable.

05:45.303 --> 05:49.390
Do you think Hiram would put on a hood
and start shooting people for a mayorship?

05:49.474 --> 05:51.726
No.
But he would hire someone to do it.

05:51.809 --> 05:54.437
We were thinking
it could be a Serpent, Jug. Or a Ghoulie.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.981
Or, even more insidiously...

05:57.648 --> 06:01.194
the man Hiram put in charge
of restoring peace and harmony.

06:01.277 --> 06:03.780
-Sheriff Minetta.
-He was supposedly guarding the hall,

06:03.863 --> 06:06.199
-but no one saw him.
-He was MIA for Riot Night.

06:06.282 --> 06:08.159
-I'd start there.
-Will do.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.953
I have to go to the sheriff's station
anyway.

06:11.037 --> 06:11.913
Why, Arch?

06:13.206 --> 06:15.792
I have to identify your dad, Betty.

06:20.588 --> 06:24.008
And with that, it's official.
Congratulations.

06:24.550 --> 06:28.054
With Nana Blossom as my guardian,
and I her youthful ward,

06:28.137 --> 06:31.599
Mummy and Uncle Claudius' stranglehold
on my life and happiness has ended.

06:32.058 --> 06:35.937
I will file the papers and send
this letter of separation to your mother.

06:36.145 --> 06:37.105
Oh, no need.

06:37.188 --> 06:40.650
She and my odious uncle
are living in one of the barns.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.819
I'll happily deliver this missive.

06:49.951 --> 06:51.327
Especially with Fred.

06:51.410 --> 06:53.329
Now, now, Claudius.

06:53.412 --> 06:56.499
-First things first.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.107
Yeah, that's right. He lived here.

07:21.190 --> 07:24.360
The Black Hood. Come closer.
Do you wanna come in?

07:24.444 --> 07:27.155
Do you wanna see
where he planned his murders?

07:27.238 --> 07:30.158
Where he slept?
-Get out! Go!

07:30.241 --> 07:32.535
-The door is open.
-Go home. Turn off your cameras.

07:32.618 --> 07:34.537
-Come closer.
-Leave us alone.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.998
-Go home!

07:37.081 --> 07:40.293
"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."

07:47.300 --> 07:51.012
I don't have to go back
to school today. I could come over.

07:51.095 --> 07:53.806
I'm not sure my mom's up for company, Jug.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.476
Not until the lookie-loos move on.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.437
-I'm worried about you.
-I know.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.105
Me, too.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.232
<i>My mom and I...</i>

08:03.900 --> 08:06.694
We'll just have to get through it.
And we will.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.072
Okay.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.533
-If you need anything--
-I'll call you.

08:13.367 --> 08:15.495
-<i>I love you.</i>
-I love you, too.

08:22.376 --> 08:23.461
Ready to do this?

08:29.091 --> 08:30.009
We're set here.

08:35.681 --> 08:37.934
Archie,
can you identify the man at that table?

08:38.851 --> 08:40.061
That's Hal Cooper.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.480
My neighbor.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.651
The man who shot my dad at Pop's Diner.

08:48.152 --> 08:49.278
He's one...

08:49.946 --> 08:51.239
of the Black Hoods.

08:51.989 --> 08:53.991
A lot of people took advantage
of Riot Night.

08:54.075 --> 08:57.203
We had multiple reports
of looters wearing ski masks.

08:57.286 --> 09:00.581
The man in my house wasn't a looter.
He was there to murder my father.

09:04.502 --> 09:07.838
You may not be taking this seriously...
but I am.

09:08.339 --> 09:12.093
I'm not gonna let this go.
Make sure your boss knows that.

09:14.303 --> 09:16.347
<i>What can I do for you, Betty?</i>

09:18.266 --> 09:21.477
I just wanted to say I'm sorry,
Mr. Andrews.

09:22.436 --> 09:25.398
You have nothing to apologize for, Betty.

09:26.482 --> 09:29.986
-You didn't do anything wrong.
-I'm supposed to be this...

09:31.529 --> 09:33.030
great detective.

09:34.991 --> 09:37.868
But I didn't see
what was right in front of me.

09:41.622 --> 09:45.084
And people paid for that mistake
with their lives.

09:51.549 --> 09:52.800
Moose

09:59.682 --> 10:01.350
All of her stuff is gone.

10:01.976 --> 10:04.604
-Midge's locker was trashed.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.064
And all the notes people left her

10:07.148 --> 10:09.859
and her books and her stuffed animals...

10:09.942 --> 10:11.110
it's all gone.

10:13.154 --> 10:16.365
They're just things.
You're gonna be okay, Moose.

10:33.090 --> 10:34.842
You're withdrawing from the race?

10:34.925 --> 10:35.760
It's clear.

10:36.177 --> 10:39.764
Reggie Mantle is not ready
to be a leader of men.

10:39.847 --> 10:45.519
And my mom and I had a big talk
after the riots, and I am an artist.

10:45.603 --> 10:46.604
Not a politician.

10:47.146 --> 10:50.066
I need to get back to what I'm best at.
Music.

10:51.317 --> 10:55.488
-Then there was one.
-Don't forget about Ethel Muggs,

10:55.571 --> 10:58.199
who's running as a third-party candidate.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.327
<i>This is how it ends?</i>

11:01.410 --> 11:03.496
Not with a whimper,
but a memo from Weatherbee.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.750
Riverdale High
is now suddenly overcrowded.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.252
Starting next week,
former Southside High students

11:10.336 --> 11:12.880
will be bussed to Seaside High,
which is two hours away.

11:13.464 --> 11:16.592
Meaning he blames us
for trashing the school during Riot Night.

11:16.675 --> 11:20.513
Well, to be fair, Sweet Pea... you did.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.519
What's our play

11:26.977 --> 11:30.981
I don't know. We can't keep
fighting for a gang that doesn't exist.

11:31.065 --> 11:34.193
What about us?
Or the other Serpents at the Wyrm?

11:35.277 --> 11:36.987
What Serpents at the Wyrm?

11:38.114 --> 11:39.615
Buenos dias, Veronica.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.118
I thought you'd wanna know,

11:42.201 --> 11:46.497
I saw your strapping, conquistador father
in a summit with Mummy and Uncle Claudius

11:47.039 --> 11:49.667
In one of Thornhill's barns,
of all places.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.627
It looked like collusion.

11:52.753 --> 11:53.796
<i>Daddykins.</i>

11:53.879 --> 11:57.091
Care to comment on rumors
you're having secret meetings

11:57.174 --> 11:59.593
with Claudius and Penelope Blossom?

11:59.760 --> 12:03.556
Certainly. I'm looking to diversify
Lodge Industries' holdings

12:03.639 --> 12:06.892
-by getting into the maple trade.
I see.

12:06.976 --> 12:10.438
So, it's not that you enlisted Claudius
to impersonate the Black Hood

12:13.858 --> 12:16.026
Your imagination's
getting the better of you.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.404
Maybe. Maybe not.

12:19.488 --> 12:23.325
But I don't think any of us
can deny it's not at least possible

12:23.784 --> 12:28.914
that you'd put Mom in the crosshairs
to pursue some personal, political agenda.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.060
I don't understand.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.521
You saw what the Ghoulies
did to most of Sunnyside.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.065
A lot of Serpents couldn't afford
to leave Riverdale.

12:55.816 --> 12:57.109
So, we came here.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.904
Does my dad know about this?

13:03.657 --> 13:05.618
You should come to school,
be with us.

13:05.701 --> 13:06.994
No. How can I?

13:07.077 --> 13:10.664
-You can't carry this weight on your own.
-Veronica's right.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.708
My dad killed Midge.

13:13.083 --> 13:16.378
He shot Moose. How am I supposed
to show my face there again?

13:20.591 --> 13:23.677
Do you hate him
for what he did to your dad?

13:24.178 --> 13:25.262
Because I do.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.350
I hate my father.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.617
Since when are you drinking?

13:46.700 --> 13:50.788
I am celebrating the fact
that I am no longer Hiram Lodge's busboy.

13:52.456 --> 13:56.168
He fired me from Pop's today.
He's cleaning house.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.963
-Getting rid of stragglers.
-He's a bastard.

13:59.046 --> 14:01.131
-Yeah.
We have work to do.

14:01.215 --> 14:02.174
Why'd you lie?

14:03.133 --> 14:04.843
You told me the Serpents don't exist.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.888
-They're at the Wyrm and need help.
-What they need

14:07.972 --> 14:11.058
is to cut bait
and get out while they still can.

14:11.141 --> 14:14.603
Now, I wasn't lying
when I said that it was over, Jug.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.063
It is time, boy.

14:16.146 --> 14:19.441
-It is time to skip town.

14:19.525 --> 14:22.111
-I'm not going.
-You bet your ass you are.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.530
Toledo. I already told your mom.

14:24.613 --> 14:27.825
No, I'm not leaving Betty.
We are not abandoning the Serpents.

14:32.788 --> 14:36.292
I won't be standing over a body bag
with you zipped up in it.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.502
We're moving to Toledo.

14:38.586 --> 14:41.797
But pack light.
We're only taking the bikes.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.848
<i>♪ One fine day ♪</i>

14:50.931 --> 14:52.725
Do we have a shot, Mrs. McCoy?

14:53.726 --> 14:56.687
Elections are won and lost
in these two days.

14:56.770 --> 15:00.608
In my opinion, Fred,
your key to victory is the Southside vote.

15:00.691 --> 15:04.028
Southsiders don't vote
because they feel marginalized.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.280
If you can get them to the booths,

15:06.363 --> 15:08.449
they'll vote for you, not Hermione.

15:08.824 --> 15:12.244
Sorry to interrupt. Uh, Sheriff Minetta's
on the phone. It's urgent.

15:13.329 --> 15:18.000
After your visit, I made it my mission
to catch the man who invaded your home.

15:19.668 --> 15:24.256
An anonymous tip led to the suspect,
and when we went to question him--

15:24.340 --> 15:29.386
Unfortunately, he engaged in a fire-fight,
and we were forced to take him down.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.597
He's dead, but he's the guy.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.642
-No question.

15:34.725 --> 15:38.896
We found guns on the premises that match
ones used at both the attack on your house

15:39.521 --> 15:42.858
and the town hall shooting.
As well as this black hood.

15:46.403 --> 15:49.490
-Ex-gang member. Gerald Petite.

15:50.449 --> 15:51.700
Also known as Tall Boy.

15:54.495 --> 15:56.747
You haven't gone to visit Dad yet?

15:56.830 --> 15:59.249
We're taking things
one step at a time, Polly.

15:59.458 --> 16:02.211
If we don't visit,
how are we supposed to forgive him?

16:03.671 --> 16:05.005
What are you talking about?

16:05.089 --> 16:08.467
Betty, at the farm, they taught us
forgiveness is the most valuable gift.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.388
If we don't absolve him,
we become what he was. Full of hate.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.057
My babies deserve a mother
who's better than that.

16:15.766 --> 16:19.603
Maybe Polly's right. I mean,
not about forgiving him, but seeing him.

16:20.187 --> 16:23.565
-No.
-Maybe that way we can get some answers,

16:23.649 --> 16:25.526
or I can give him a piece of my mind.

16:25.609 --> 16:29.029
If that's what you want, Mom.
But you two can count me out.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.413
You were right, Veronica.

16:37.496 --> 16:41.125
It's conceivable your father's
behind the attack at town hall.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.168
And it made me think...

16:44.503 --> 16:48.632
that we, or at least you,
should have a contingency in place.

16:49.174 --> 16:52.386
There's a bit of leverage,
that, should you acquire it,

16:52.886 --> 16:56.640
-will give you power over your father.
-That's music to my ears.

16:57.933 --> 17:01.729
Your father's plan for the Southside
go far beyond the prison.

17:01.812 --> 17:06.734
He wants to consolidate
the entire area into something.

17:08.068 --> 17:11.864
There's one critical piece
of the Southside he doesn't own yet

17:12.072 --> 17:14.783
that's keeping his takeover
from being complete,

17:14.867 --> 17:17.703
though he's in negotiations
with the proprietor.

17:17.786 --> 17:20.497
-The Whyte Wyrm.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.668
Now, you'll need money to block him,
of course.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.713
That should be easy enough to get.

17:29.339 --> 17:32.384
Daddy, Attorney McCoy is representing me

17:32.468 --> 17:34.803
in regards to that million dollars
you plundered.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.264
My client would like it back.

17:37.347 --> 17:40.517
That money's in a trust.
I'm looking out for her future.

17:40.601 --> 17:43.062
Of course. And I'm looking out for yours.

17:43.145 --> 17:47.107
The election's in two days
and you still want Mom to win, right?

17:47.232 --> 17:51.695
Well, if you don't release my funds,
I'll start telling your secrets, Daddy.

17:52.279 --> 17:54.656
The fake Black Hood attacks,
Papa Poutine's murder,

17:54.740 --> 18:00.579
the crippling of Nick St. Clair. I won't
stop until your dirty laundry is exposed.

18:01.163 --> 18:05.334
Or, of course, you could simply give
my client what's rightfully hers.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.884
Of course it's Tall Boy.

18:13.967 --> 18:16.970
-I'm an idiot.

18:17.054 --> 18:20.724
-He's done Hiram's dirty work before.

18:20.933 --> 18:25.229
He confessed to it, which explains why
he died, suddenly, in a fire-fight.

18:25.729 --> 18:28.190
There's no loose ends.
He can't implicate Hiram, ever.

18:28.273 --> 18:30.984
Now Sheriff Minetta can say
the case is closed.

18:31.068 --> 18:35.072
Hiram is gonna get away with it.
He's gonna get away with all of it.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.330
Nana Rose, Cheryl?

18:44.123 --> 18:46.625
You really think that that senile crone

18:46.708 --> 18:49.128
would be a better guardian
than your own mother?

18:49.253 --> 18:50.796
Oh, Mumsie.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.214
Enough.

18:53.090 --> 18:56.260
I'm off to deliver nibbles to my cherie
and chums at the Whyte Wyrm.

18:56.343 --> 18:57.511
Cheryl, no.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.097
You can't go there.

19:00.180 --> 19:01.723
Not tonight.

19:01.807 --> 19:04.393
And why, pray tell, not?

19:07.479 --> 19:11.900
On top of everything, my dad, who's
drinking again, wants to move to Toledo.

19:12.484 --> 19:16.446
Just in time. Weatherbee wants to kick
the Southsiders out of Riverdale High.

19:17.906 --> 19:18.991
Zip it.

19:19.074 --> 19:21.535
We have to get to the Wyrm.
I called Toni.

19:21.618 --> 19:25.664
-Lodge's cyborg sheriff's raiding the bar.

19:25.747 --> 19:28.750
If things turn violent and Serpents
get shot, so much the better.

19:29.626 --> 19:30.961
Let's go.

19:31.712 --> 19:35.174
Take only what you absolutely need
and can carry with you.

19:35.257 --> 19:37.676
We need to move quickly and quietly.

19:37.759 --> 19:40.929
Minetta's forces are all over,
looking for our blood.

19:41.513 --> 19:46.059
If we want our skulls to remain uncracked,
we have to go undetected.

19:46.143 --> 19:48.103
Go where? There's nowhere safe.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.814
We've been offered asylum
on the Northside.

20:47.454 --> 20:49.998
Come on, Jug. Don't look back.

21:06.723 --> 21:08.141
Hey, good boy.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.477
All right. Two dots and a dash.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.896
Two chicks on a raft, here, Jug.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.648
There's a stack of Vermont up.

21:14.731 --> 21:17.276
I worked at Pop's for a summer. Come on.

21:17.359 --> 21:18.443
What's going on here?

21:20.946 --> 21:22.072
You do all this?

21:23.073 --> 21:24.700
With an assist from Archie.

21:26.201 --> 21:27.494
Toledo's gonna have to wait.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.039
Maybe so.

21:32.082 --> 21:36.003
Bulldogs helping Serpents, Freddy Andrews
opening his house to a bunch of snakes.

21:36.086 --> 21:38.380
There goes the rest
of your Northside vote, buddy.

21:38.463 --> 21:41.216
We're all neighbors here.
All right, bacon.

21:42.843 --> 21:46.763
Hey. Thank you.
You came through for me.

21:50.726 --> 21:53.895
I'm not done yet.
How many Serpent jackets can we borrow?

22:00.027 --> 22:02.696
Please have these faxed
to the superintendent.

22:02.779 --> 22:08.160
<i>♪ But I turn my grave, you belong to me</i>
<i>'Long to me, 'long to me, 'long to me ♪</i>

22:08.702 --> 22:12.205
<i>♪ As we look in your eyes ♪</i>

22:13.332 --> 22:16.126
-It's a show of support.

22:17.127 --> 22:20.464
For the Southsiders who are being
wrongly transferred.

22:21.256 --> 22:23.633
We're ready to walk out,
Principal Weatherbee.

22:24.384 --> 22:27.679
Any student who walks out
better keep walking.

22:27.763 --> 22:30.182
-Because they'll be expelled.
-You're a good man.

22:30.265 --> 22:32.434
You're not the kind of person
who discriminates.

22:33.018 --> 22:35.020
And if you are? Then expel me.

22:36.229 --> 22:37.731
I don't wanna be a part of that.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.781
Everyone, get to class.

22:52.079 --> 22:56.458
-That jacket looks good on you.
-Everything looks good on me.

22:56.708 --> 22:59.002
Maybe we should make it official.

23:02.464 --> 23:04.299
Jughead. Come here.

23:07.135 --> 23:12.140
I have insider information that my father
is making a play to buy the Whyte Wyrm.

23:12.599 --> 23:15.352
-Along with him firing my dad.

23:16.645 --> 23:19.856
-Yeah. Won't be eating there anymore.

23:20.273 --> 23:21.525
Wait, Jughead.

23:22.609 --> 23:24.444
I was gonna make a play to buy the Wyrm

23:24.528 --> 23:27.614
in order to torpedo Daddy's monopolizing
of the Southside,

23:27.697 --> 23:31.993
but now I'm thinking
there's a better, smarter play here.

23:33.161 --> 23:35.997
If you trust me and we move fast.

23:38.166 --> 23:39.751
Hello

23:43.088 --> 23:44.297
Daddy.

23:45.590 --> 23:48.301
Welcome to the bar
I bought from Mr. Hoggins two hours ago.

23:50.470 --> 23:54.266
Here's the deed,
looked-over by my attorney, Sierra McCoy.

23:56.059 --> 23:57.853
All legal, of course.

24:00.105 --> 24:03.608
But I'm willing to sell
the Whyte Wyrm to you.

24:04.776 --> 24:06.361
Or rather, trade it.

24:08.113 --> 24:11.199
In exchange for Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe.

24:14.744 --> 24:16.997
How did you know
I was after the Wyrm?

24:18.665 --> 24:22.210
It was the hot gossip amongst the Serpents
who escaped to Fred Andrews' house

24:22.711 --> 24:24.462
the night of your misbegotten raid.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.048
You're risking war with me over Pop's?

24:27.549 --> 24:29.843
-Because I realized,

24:29.926 --> 24:34.181
once I learned
how you so callously fired Mr. Jones...

24:35.182 --> 24:38.643
that Pop's is one of the only places
left in this town

24:38.727 --> 24:41.188
that my friends and I can call our own.

24:43.356 --> 24:45.108
I'm looking for an even trade here.

24:48.904 --> 24:49.946
You wanna barter?

24:52.574 --> 24:53.575
Let's barter.

24:54.951 --> 24:58.788
But to be clear,
if I make this deal with you, that's it.

24:58.872 --> 25:00.498
The last thing you'll get from me.

25:01.082 --> 25:04.336
No more allowance, no more trust fund,
no more credit cards.

25:05.128 --> 25:09.216
You'll also sign over your third
of Lodge Industries to me.

25:09.299 --> 25:12.469
You'll relinquish your vote,
your seat on the board,

25:13.053 --> 25:13.970
your legacy.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.021
Fine.

25:24.105 --> 25:25.774
It's all blood money anyway.

25:27.901 --> 25:28.902
Jug?

25:32.322 --> 25:34.950
Do you think evil can be passed on?

25:37.202 --> 25:38.036
Betty.

25:40.914 --> 25:42.832
My great-grandfather had it.

25:43.500 --> 25:46.044
My grandfather, my father,
they were all...

25:48.004 --> 25:49.381
murderers, Jug.

25:49.464 --> 25:51.716
-That's just circumstance.

25:52.842 --> 25:57.305
Or is it possible this baby will grow up
to be a monster like my father?

25:57.389 --> 25:58.556
Or like me?

25:59.849 --> 26:00.809
That's easy.

26:03.144 --> 26:06.356
No. That baby is not evil.

26:06.439 --> 26:09.067
-And neither are you.

26:09.693 --> 26:14.114
My destiny Something
I'll never control or understand?

26:14.197 --> 26:15.949
Hey. Look at me.

26:17.617 --> 26:18.618
I know you.

26:22.539 --> 26:24.499
You're a good person, Betty.

26:24.582 --> 26:27.210
You might have some darkness,
just like me...

26:28.003 --> 26:29.754
but you're not evil.

26:33.508 --> 26:34.759
Do you believe that?

26:36.720 --> 26:37.887
Do you believe me?

26:44.644 --> 26:45.729
Yeah.

27:08.668 --> 27:10.253
Think you'll eek it out, Arch?

27:11.671 --> 27:14.382
Mine's not the election I'm worried about.

27:15.425 --> 27:20.930
In the meantime, Betty is voting for you,
through me, by proxy.

27:21.431 --> 27:22.349
How's she doing?

27:23.266 --> 27:24.142
You know...

27:25.727 --> 27:27.145
<i>I think she's gonna be okay.</i>

27:28.188 --> 27:31.691
I told myself
I wasn't going to see you again.

27:33.318 --> 27:34.235
Really?

27:35.653 --> 27:37.697
I never doubted for a moment you'd come.

27:38.573 --> 27:41.076
You're the only one who understands me.

27:42.827 --> 27:44.120
Is like me.

27:45.455 --> 27:46.414
You did...

27:48.875 --> 27:50.543
unspeakable... horrible things.

27:54.339 --> 27:55.715
I'm not like that.

27:56.257 --> 27:57.884
I am not like you.

27:57.967 --> 27:59.344
Aren't you?

28:01.721 --> 28:02.597
No.

28:09.187 --> 28:10.730
Then why are you here?

28:20.240 --> 28:21.908
To say goodbye, Dad.

28:26.162 --> 28:27.747
And also to say:

28:28.373 --> 28:29.999
No more darkness.

28:32.001 --> 28:33.420
No more evil.

28:36.381 --> 28:37.382
It's over.

28:43.054 --> 28:45.181
You have no power over me. You'll be back, Betty.

28:56.693 --> 29:00.071
You can move across the country.
You can change the locks.

29:00.363 --> 29:02.699
You can fry me
in the electric chair,

29:02.782 --> 29:04.909
but I will always be with you, Betty.

29:04.993 --> 29:06.745
The voice inside your head.

29:14.961 --> 29:16.921
<i>Attention, Riverdale High students.</i>

29:17.005 --> 29:19.883
<i>The results</i>
<i>of your student council election are in.</i>

29:21.384 --> 29:23.595
<i>Your new student body president is...</i>

29:34.564 --> 29:38.526
<i>all former Southside High students</i>
<i>will remain at Riverdale High.</i>

29:38.610 --> 29:39.569
<i>That is all.</i>

30:01.466 --> 30:03.593
Listen up now! All right, listen up!

30:06.137 --> 30:08.097
Some 60 years ago,

30:08.765 --> 30:12.727
the very first Serpent meeting took place
on these same riverbanks.

30:13.269 --> 30:17.065
Now, it makes sense that this is
where we gather now, where I--

30:20.693 --> 30:23.530
Where I say my goodbye.
Would you step up here, son?

30:32.497 --> 30:35.500
-What I should have a long time ago.

30:38.086 --> 30:40.421
I'm retiring from the Serpents.

30:41.005 --> 30:42.340
For real this time.

30:43.299 --> 30:44.300
Whoa.

30:45.176 --> 30:46.511
Now, my boy...

30:46.970 --> 30:50.932
My boy has never stopped fighting
for this crew.

30:51.015 --> 30:52.725
Hell, he almost died for it.

30:53.351 --> 30:56.187
-That's why I'm giving you the mantle.
Yeah!

31:01.150 --> 31:03.027
Whoo!

31:05.613 --> 31:09.492
And now, as for your first official duty
as Serpent King...

31:13.913 --> 31:15.748
I think you know what to do with this.

31:18.376 --> 31:19.210
Take it.

31:23.631 --> 31:25.800
-Yeah!

31:29.596 --> 31:31.264
All right. All right.

31:32.307 --> 31:33.474
All I can say is...

31:35.435 --> 31:36.436
I love you, Dad.

31:38.021 --> 31:41.482
And the Serpents will not die out.
Not on my watch.

32:11.346 --> 32:13.222
I wanted to let you know, Mom...

32:15.558 --> 32:17.393
I went to see Dad today.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.649
-To be honest, it was...

32:24.359 --> 32:25.360
hard.

32:27.695 --> 32:32.033
But I-- I think tomorrow,
I wanna go back to school,

32:32.116 --> 32:33.868
if you think you'll be okay.

32:46.381 --> 32:47.632
Hello?

32:49.717 --> 32:51.260
Well, um...

32:52.345 --> 32:55.223
I appreciate it. Thanks.

33:04.482 --> 33:06.150
Hermione won.

33:08.319 --> 33:09.445
I'm sorry, Dad.

33:15.952 --> 33:17.120
Dad.

33:21.332 --> 33:22.375
Hello, Fred.

33:23.626 --> 33:24.502
May I come in?

33:25.086 --> 33:27.588
Was it close, at least?
-Very.

33:28.881 --> 33:31.426
-Less than 200 votes.

33:31.509 --> 33:36.305
No, Sierra. I came to tell Fred
that he ran a great campaign.

33:49.235 --> 33:51.154
Where did you say
your dad was tonight?

33:53.823 --> 33:54.699
<i> Veronica?</i>

33:56.451 --> 33:57.326
Hermione?

34:00.288 --> 34:01.956
They're at my house, Mr. Lodge.

34:07.670 --> 34:09.714
Archie, what are you

34:11.507 --> 34:12.717
How did you get in here?

34:16.471 --> 34:20.308
The door to the servants quarters
that Veronica keeps unlocked.

34:22.602 --> 34:26.689
Oh. I'll have to see
about getting those locks changed.

34:28.232 --> 34:31.486
Oh, congratulations, Mr. Lodge. You won.

34:31.819 --> 34:33.029
Everything you wanted.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.783
The Wyrm. The election. The Southside.

34:37.909 --> 34:38.868
The town.

34:41.704 --> 34:42.914
What do you have there?

34:50.797 --> 34:54.550
After my dad was shot,
I felt lost, powerless.

34:55.301 --> 34:56.511
And you took advantage of that.

34:57.303 --> 34:58.596
Manipulated me.

35:00.515 --> 35:02.391
I know about Tall Boy, Mr. Lodge.

35:02.850 --> 35:05.394
That you hired him to go after my dad.

35:06.104 --> 35:09.065
The same way you got Andre
to kill Papa Poutine.

35:10.066 --> 35:11.651
And that boy at Shadow Lake.

35:12.443 --> 35:14.403
What was his name, Cassidy something?

35:15.530 --> 35:17.448
I practically saw that murder.

35:18.574 --> 35:22.620
And Penny and the Ghoulies
who almost killed Jughead at your bidding.

35:23.204 --> 35:24.038
Archie.

35:26.457 --> 35:28.167
These delusions of yours...

35:30.920 --> 35:32.338
You're smart, Mr. Lodge.

35:33.214 --> 35:36.467
So, all or any of this
will be hard to prove.

35:37.802 --> 35:38.803
But I will.

35:39.554 --> 35:40.847
Wherever you go...

35:41.430 --> 35:42.598
whatever you do...

35:43.683 --> 35:44.934
I'm gonna be there.

35:46.185 --> 35:47.478
Watching.

35:48.271 --> 35:51.315
When I do prove this,
I'm just gonna come for you.

35:52.984 --> 35:55.695
And I won't hesitate,
like with the Black Hood.

35:57.196 --> 36:01.409
I'm gonna make my bones, once and for all.

36:19.552 --> 36:22.513
Well, here's a fun fact
about my newest acquisition.

36:23.055 --> 36:24.765
According to Pop Tate,

36:24.849 --> 36:28.561
the basement of this very diner
used to be a secret speakeasy,

36:28.644 --> 36:33.232
back in the days of flapper dresses
and cigarette girls. So...

36:35.151 --> 36:38.613
-I wanna reopen that speakeasy.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.908
A cabaret space
for world-class entertainment

36:41.991 --> 36:43.784
and decadent cocktails.

36:43.868 --> 36:45.995
A place for North and Southsiders alike.

36:46.078 --> 36:49.332
In fact, Jughead, I was hoping
your dad might manage it.

36:49.749 --> 36:53.377
-To make sure the Serpents feel welcome.
-That's amazing, V.

36:57.757 --> 36:58.674
What about your dad?

37:00.218 --> 37:01.427
Knowing Daddy...

37:02.511 --> 37:05.181
he's probably plotting
some sort of revenge.

37:05.556 --> 37:09.060
<i>And though Veronica said it</i>
<i>as a half-joke, in fact...</i>

37:09.894 --> 37:11.979
<i>that's exactly what her father was doing.</i>

37:13.272 --> 37:17.610
Ladies, gentlemen, it's been months
in the making, but we're finally here.

37:18.569 --> 37:22.031
-Welcome to the new Southside.

37:22.114 --> 37:25.326
Now that she's mayor, there are
machinations she can't be privy to.

37:25.785 --> 37:29.330
But the plan remains the same. The prison
will soon be up and operational.

37:29.413 --> 37:31.540
With your drugs running through it,
Claudius.

37:31.624 --> 37:33.251
Like brother, like brother.

37:33.709 --> 37:37.213
Malachai and his Ghoulies
will be our soldiers and dealers,

37:37.296 --> 37:38.881
with Ms. Peabody troubleshooting,

37:38.965 --> 37:41.884
hopefully doing a better job
than she did killing Jughead Jones.

37:41.968 --> 37:43.886
He wasn't breathing when we left him.

37:44.428 --> 37:46.806
You promised me a brothel, Hiram.

37:46.889 --> 37:49.350
All in good time, Madame Blossom.

37:49.433 --> 37:52.353
What about your daughter?
And her meddlesome friends?

37:52.436 --> 37:53.396
Not a concern.

37:55.106 --> 38:00.444
Steps have been taken to dissolve
the very glue that holds them together.

38:05.950 --> 38:09.704
I'm proud of you, Mom,
for going to visit Dad.

38:09.787 --> 38:14.041
-I know that wasn't easy on you.
-We all have our albatrosses, Polly.

38:17.503 --> 38:21.590
I think I have someone
who can help you, Mom.

38:21.674 --> 38:24.260
A friend of mine from the farm...

38:24.927 --> 38:29.015
who healed me
when I was so broken after Jason.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.017
If you're open to it...

38:31.684 --> 38:34.895
I would love to invite him
to visit and talk to you.

38:36.439 --> 38:38.357
That sounds nice, Polly.

38:43.362 --> 38:45.740
<i>What made you decide</i>
<i>to book this room?</i>

38:45.823 --> 38:48.075
Not that I'm complaining, mind you.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.076
I don't know.

38:50.703 --> 38:52.204
It felt like after everything,

38:52.288 --> 38:56.250
a night at the Five Seasons
might be something you'd enjoy.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.255
I wanted to ask you something.

39:02.006 --> 39:05.051
Now that I am the Serpent King,

39:06.677 --> 39:09.055
I was wondering how you felt
about being my queen.

39:12.058 --> 39:14.477
Are you asking me to join the Serpents?

39:16.562 --> 39:18.314
-Sort of.
-Jug.

39:20.483 --> 39:24.945
You don't have to answer right now.
You can take your time and let me know.

39:27.156 --> 39:29.116
Like, tomorrow at lunch or--

39:32.453 --> 39:36.707
<i>It was a foolish question</i>
<i>asked between two young people in love.</i>

39:36.791 --> 39:37.917
<i>But it didn't matter.</i>

39:38.000 --> 39:41.545
<i>For it would soon be overshadowed</i>
<i>by the next day's cataclysmic events.</i>

39:49.678 --> 39:52.223
Students, faculty and staff.

39:52.306 --> 39:56.227
Before we inaugurate Archie Andrews
as student council president,

39:56.310 --> 39:58.229

41:07.506 --> 41:11.218
I didn't kill him--
-You have the right to remain silent.
