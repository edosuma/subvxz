00:01.227 --> 00:02.760
- Arthur?
- Yeah?

00:02.762 --> 00:06.031
I may have just invented
a new taste sensation.

00:06.056 --> 00:06.993
Yeah, what is it, Tush?

00:07.063 --> 00:09.915
I take a donut hole, I put a
little coffee in the middle,

00:09.940 --> 00:12.729
I call it the Tush-hole.

00:14.096 --> 00:16.531
- I don't think that's a good idea...
- No, shh, shh. Let's just enjoy this.

00:16.556 --> 00:17.775
Yes?

00:17.777 --> 00:19.777
It doesn't have to be coffee, of course.

00:19.779 --> 00:22.313
You could put anything
in your Tush-hole.

00:23.415 --> 00:25.016
Hey, that could be our ad campaign.

00:25.018 --> 00:27.719
"What do you like in your Tush-hole"

00:28.551 --> 00:30.755
Oop, I just heard it. Never mind.

00:36.763 --> 00:37.662
Fawz, what's going on?

00:37.664 --> 00:39.397
My dry cleaners was robbed!

00:39.399 --> 00:40.798
- No!
- Are you okay?

00:40.800 --> 00:42.267
Those bastards took everything!

00:42.269 --> 00:44.235
My computers, my chemicals,

00:44.237 --> 00:47.272
my hangers that say,
"We Don't Use Chemicals."

00:48.340 --> 00:50.041
Cop, girl cop, come and help.

00:50.043 --> 00:51.543
Uh, girl cop's not going anywhere

00:51.545 --> 00:53.478
till she's had her coffee.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.947
In the last 24 hours,
we've had six break-ins,

00:55.949 --> 00:59.217
two muggings and one public urinator.

00:59.219 --> 01:02.187
I really had to go.

01:02.189 --> 01:05.256
Did I really have to watch?

01:05.257 --> 01:07.158
Uh, the coffee's still brewing.

01:07.160 --> 01:08.660
All right, it'll be a few more minutes.

01:08.662 --> 01:09.994
Fine. I'll be next door.

01:09.996 --> 01:12.174
I have to give the insurance
company my wish list.

01:12.199 --> 01:16.100
I mean, the list of
things that were stolen.

01:16.102 --> 01:18.155
This crime wave is hitting
close to home, ain't it?

01:18.187 --> 01:19.726
Yeah, what's been happening here?

01:19.751 --> 01:21.906
I thought this neighborhood was
supposed to be getting nicer.

01:21.908 --> 01:25.009
Well, a spike in crime is often
a byproduct of gentrification.

01:25.011 --> 01:29.013
As Biggie Smalls once said,
"More Money, More Problems."

01:29.015 --> 01:32.150
It's actually "Mo' Money, Mo' Problems."

01:32.704 --> 01:34.931
I'm not comfortable saying it that way.

01:36.522 --> 01:38.389
Yeah, the crime wave's gotten so bad,

01:38.391 --> 01:40.491
the department's bringing in
reinforcements to help out.

01:40.493 --> 01:42.060
Yay, great. More cops.

01:42.062 --> 01:43.161
You know what that means:

01:43.163 --> 01:45.997
- more pat downs.
- More business.

01:45.999 --> 01:49.500
All this crime, guess it's
time to bring out my bus face.

01:49.502 --> 01:52.203
Did you say "bus face"?

01:52.205 --> 01:54.672
Yeah, it's this face I use
on public transportation

01:54.674 --> 01:56.274
so people don't mess with me.

01:56.276 --> 01:57.475
Let's see it.

02:01.380 --> 02:02.413
Oh, that's so cute.

02:02.415 --> 02:03.581
Adorable.

02:03.583 --> 02:05.583
Like a constipated Disney princess.

02:07.932 --> 02:10.588
Maya, that face might
work out in the suburbs,

02:10.590 --> 02:12.190
but you're in Uptown now.

02:12.192 --> 02:14.525
If you want the creepos on
the bus to leave you alone,

02:14.527 --> 02:16.527
act like a crazy person.

02:16.529 --> 02:17.962
Please don't show her how.

02:17.964 --> 02:19.268
Let me show you how.

02:20.467 --> 02:23.134
I invented a character
I call Johnny Buggins.

02:23.136 --> 02:24.769
He has a voice like this.

02:24.771 --> 02:27.672
Oh, hello there, Mr. James.

02:27.674 --> 02:28.973
You have beautiful eyes.

02:28.975 --> 02:32.569
May I take one home
and feed it to my robot?

02:35.547 --> 02:37.448
I hate Johnny Buggins.

02:37.450 --> 02:39.250
Works every time.

02:39.252 --> 02:41.786
What is taking you so long?

02:41.788 --> 02:44.289
You two are like Cagney and Lazy.

02:45.157 --> 02:46.641
Starsky and Not Much.

02:47.494 --> 02:49.027
Law & Order another donut.

02:49.029 --> 02:50.595
Okay, we get it!

02:50.597 --> 02:52.463
All right, just... We'll be right here.

02:52.465 --> 02:53.185
Forget the coffee.

02:53.210 --> 02:54.766
- Give me some beans.
- Okay.

02:54.768 --> 02:56.267
What?

02:56.269 --> 02:58.803
- Sugar.
- Oh, yeah.

02:58.805 --> 03:00.872
Mm-hmm.

03:00.874 --> 03:03.107
- Cream.
- Damn.

03:05.611 --> 03:07.812
Come on, junior, let's roll.

03:07.814 --> 03:10.515
Oh! Just kicked in.

03:18.684 --> 03:20.525
- Yo, that club was so lit.
- Right?

03:20.527 --> 03:21.553
That girl was so into me.

03:21.578 --> 03:22.788
Yeah, man, but look, next time,

03:22.873 --> 03:24.592
can you not introduce me as your butler?

03:25.694 --> 03:27.565
Let me check on the store real quick.

03:30.936 --> 03:32.370
Arthur? Is that you?

03:32.372 --> 03:34.138
Oh, geez!

03:34.140 --> 03:35.707
What the hell you guys doing out here?

03:35.709 --> 03:37.155
Well, I thought with
everything going on,

03:37.210 --> 03:38.409
I would check on the store.

03:38.467 --> 03:39.538
It's 4:00 in the morning!

03:39.620 --> 03:41.446
Well, yeah, Sweatpants
and I, we just got back

03:41.448 --> 03:42.613
from this after-hours club.

03:42.615 --> 03:44.803
How do you dance in those tight pants?

03:44.828 --> 03:46.718
Oh, well, I'm more of a upper-body guy.

03:46.720 --> 03:47.719
I see.

03:47.721 --> 03:49.253
- And I'm strictly lower body.
- Yeah.

03:49.255 --> 03:51.556
Yeah. Well, an-anyway...

03:51.558 --> 03:52.990
- What? Oh, you want some?
- Hmm? Hmm?

03:52.992 --> 03:54.559
Hey, hey!

03:54.561 --> 03:55.626
- Hey, guys!
- Oh!

03:55.628 --> 03:57.363
- Huh? 
- I'm-a catch you later, man.

03:57.388 --> 03:58.763
- All right, man, be good.
- All right, see you.

03:58.765 --> 04:00.765
- All right.
- What are you doing out, huh?

04:00.767 --> 04:01.933
In your robe.

04:01.935 --> 04:03.167
On your way to a prizefight?

04:03.169 --> 04:04.202
No.

04:04.204 --> 04:06.003
I just go down the
block to the paper box

04:06.005 --> 04:07.472
and pick up a Sun-Times.

04:07.474 --> 04:10.508
What? That's, like,
four blocks away, man.

04:10.510 --> 04:12.610
Well, so what? I do it every morning.

04:12.612 --> 04:13.911
It's my routine.

04:13.913 --> 04:15.947
Arthur, you cannot be walking
around this neighborhood

04:15.949 --> 04:18.182
at this hour, man. People get mugged.

04:18.184 --> 04:19.916
One time, I got robbed right over there.

04:19.918 --> 04:22.086
Yeah, I know, that's
because you're a target.

04:22.088 --> 04:24.622
I mean, look at me, I
got nothing to steal.

04:25.306 --> 04:27.325
Well, except for that coin purse.

04:27.327 --> 04:29.370
Oh, wait, that's not a coin purse!

04:38.829 --> 04:39.977
Says he does it every morning.

04:40.063 --> 04:42.328
All by himself, to the corner and back.

04:42.353 --> 04:44.186
That's a bad idea. Most
crimes are committed

04:44.188 --> 04:45.446
between 2:00 and 6:00 in the morning.

04:45.471 --> 04:47.055
Yeah, and Arthur's an old man.

04:47.079 --> 04:49.270
He shouldn't be out at 4:00
a.m. He should be in bed,

04:49.295 --> 04:52.282
having sex dreams about
Angela Lansbury or somebody.

04:53.251 --> 04:55.719
Well, he's been getting
that paper forever.

04:55.721 --> 04:57.788
Good luck trying to get him to stop.

04:58.756 --> 05:00.390
There we go.

05:01.520 --> 05:03.360
Fawz, what the hell is that?

05:03.849 --> 05:06.730
Since I was robbed, I'm taking
matters into my own hands.

05:06.732 --> 05:09.533
I will place him in the
window to deter criminals.

05:09.535 --> 05:11.135
You've heard of a scarecrow?

05:11.137 --> 05:13.837
This is a scarecop.

05:14.572 --> 05:15.839
So, Fawz, let me guess,

05:15.841 --> 05:17.574
you got the black mannequin
because it's scarier?

05:17.576 --> 05:19.046
No, because it was cheaper.

05:21.046 --> 05:23.547
Which is terrible.

05:23.549 --> 05:25.282
You really think that's gonna work?

05:25.284 --> 05:26.683
I have to do something.

05:26.685 --> 05:28.652
Sal's Florist Shop
was robbed last night.

05:28.654 --> 05:30.220
Thank God no one was hurt.

05:30.222 --> 05:33.157
Oh, except for Sal,
who was beaten severely.

05:33.159 --> 05:34.858
Old man Sal?

05:34.860 --> 05:37.394
He's been in this neighborhood
just as long as Arthur has.

05:37.396 --> 05:39.730
He's in the hospital,
but he's gonna be okay.

05:39.732 --> 05:44.101
Come on, let's go duct tape
this donut to your hand.

05:44.103 --> 05:45.732
Make you more authentic.

05:47.745 --> 05:48.822
This is ridiculous, man.

05:48.847 --> 05:49.873
I got, I got to talk to him.

05:49.875 --> 05:51.575
- Yo, Arthur.
- No.

05:51.577 --> 05:53.585
- You don't even know what I'm about to..
- I like my morning paper.

05:53.746 --> 05:55.379
- But why don't you get...
- I don't want a subscription.

05:55.381 --> 05:56.446
Ha! I wasn't gonna say that.

05:56.448 --> 05:57.548
I was gonna say "prescription"

05:57.550 --> 05:58.782
but I knew that wasn't right.

05:58.784 --> 05:59.850
- Oh.
- Come on, man.

05:59.852 --> 06:01.344
Everybody's getting hit.

06:01.369 --> 06:02.397
You heard about Sal, right?

06:02.422 --> 06:04.758
Yeah, yeah, and it was
terrible, but he's not like me.

06:04.883 --> 06:06.456
Look, I love starting off my morning

06:06.458 --> 06:08.158
with a nice short walk outside.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.793
I find it invigorating.

06:09.795 --> 06:12.236
Oh, come on, Arthur.
I need you to be safe.

06:12.261 --> 06:14.017
I am safe! Look,

06:14.042 --> 06:16.977
I've taken over 15,000
trips to that newspaper box.

06:17.002 --> 06:19.203
Nothing bad has ever happened to me.

06:19.228 --> 06:21.438
And no way I'm giving
up my independence.

06:21.440 --> 06:22.806
What are you talking about?

06:22.808 --> 06:24.041
Well, it's a slippery slope.

06:24.043 --> 06:25.609
One day, you give up your morning walk,

06:25.611 --> 06:27.644
the next day, you're
taking my car keys from me.

06:27.646 --> 06:29.146
You don't even have a car.

06:29.148 --> 06:30.625
I'm glad you think that.

06:38.290 --> 06:39.864
Oh, Franco.

06:39.889 --> 06:41.191
Franco, why you calling me so early?

06:41.193 --> 06:42.926
'Cause I didn't want to scare you.

06:42.928 --> 06:44.995
Scare me? How could you scare me?

06:44.997 --> 06:46.688
By being inside your apartment.

06:48.149 --> 06:49.299
What the hell are you doing in here?

06:49.301 --> 06:50.734
Teaching you a lesson.

06:50.736 --> 06:53.432
You see, you think you're
invincible, but you're not.

06:53.457 --> 06:54.830
Hey, how'd you get in?

06:54.855 --> 06:55.921
The better question is:

06:55.923 --> 06:57.723
out of all the many
and easy ways to get in,

06:57.725 --> 06:59.057
which one did I choose?

06:59.059 --> 07:02.327
Did I use telekinesis to
open the lock with my mind?

07:02.329 --> 07:05.297
No, he did not.

07:05.822 --> 07:08.024
It was I, Sweatpants,

07:09.782 --> 07:12.028
using the spare key you
keep under your doormat.

07:12.053 --> 07:13.305
- Ah.
- All right, Sweatpants,

07:13.307 --> 07:14.439
tell Arthur what you'd do to him.

07:14.441 --> 07:15.574
I don't know.

07:15.576 --> 07:17.776
Guess I'll probably tie
you up to this chair,

07:17.778 --> 07:19.426
take all of your stuff,

07:19.551 --> 07:22.458
realize... you've seen my face.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.880
Place a lit cigarette in your hand

07:24.905 --> 07:27.252
and burn this place down
so nobody knows I was here.

07:27.254 --> 07:28.286
Yeah.

07:28.288 --> 07:30.489
He just finished watching The Wire.

07:32.433 --> 07:35.027
Well, I guess I better
get rid of this spare key.

07:35.029 --> 07:36.382
Good. Good, good, good.

07:36.407 --> 07:37.596
But that's not how I got in.

07:37.598 --> 07:39.831
Say I was an eager, young criminal,

07:39.833 --> 07:41.944
and I noticed that the fire escape

07:41.969 --> 07:43.468
leads me up to the second-story window,

07:43.470 --> 07:45.841
with a latch that appears to be busted.

07:46.037 --> 07:47.176
Oh, come on.

07:47.201 --> 07:48.895
Who'd want to do all
that just to get in here?

07:48.920 --> 07:50.180
Someone like me.

07:52.601 --> 07:54.212
Who would take a blanket,
put it over your head,

07:54.214 --> 07:55.914
handcuff you to a radiator

07:55.916 --> 07:58.216
and crazy glue your
butt cheeks together.

07:59.052 --> 08:00.750
Where you getting this stuff, man?

08:00.775 --> 08:03.388
Five older brothers,
no adult supervision.

08:04.757 --> 08:06.379
So you got in through this window?

08:06.404 --> 08:07.359
No, I did not.

08:07.361 --> 08:09.061
I got in by jumping
on top of the Dumpster

08:09.063 --> 08:11.496
in the alleyway and climbing
through your bedroom window.

08:11.498 --> 08:12.964
Wait a minute.

08:12.966 --> 08:15.457
You can get in my bedroom
window from the alley?

08:15.528 --> 08:17.102
Let's ask Sweatpants. Sweatpants!

08:19.450 --> 08:21.640
Was I supposed to come
in through the bedroom?

08:21.642 --> 08:24.173
All right, all right,
you made your point. Wow.

08:24.454 --> 08:26.546
Never thought I would
be this vulnerable.

08:26.571 --> 08:28.213
Good. So you agree that I should take

08:28.215 --> 08:30.022
a few safety precautions around here?

08:30.047 --> 08:30.916
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Would you guys get...

08:30.918 --> 08:32.317
Just get the hell out of here, okay?

08:32.318 --> 08:35.486
All right, come on,
Sweatpants, time to go.

08:35.511 --> 08:39.147
You know, I really expected more cats.

08:44.044 --> 08:45.279
Well, Johnny Buggins,

08:45.281 --> 08:46.714
that crazy act doesn't work.

08:46.716 --> 08:48.415
I tried it with some weirdo on the bus,

08:48.417 --> 08:49.914
and he invited me to spend the night

08:49.939 --> 08:51.914
in his abandoned dryer
under the highway.

08:54.222 --> 08:55.355
All right, slow down.

08:55.357 --> 08:56.890
Show me your Buggins.

08:57.767 --> 08:59.468
Give me a freaking donut!

09:02.765 --> 09:04.098
It was so cute.

09:04.100 --> 09:06.667
You're like a British Muppet.

09:06.669 --> 09:07.768
Damn it.

09:07.770 --> 09:09.136
Yo, so I just got off the phone

09:09.138 --> 09:10.270
with a security company,

09:10.272 --> 09:11.682
and they can, uh, put
bars in the windows

09:11.707 --> 09:13.841
and install some cameras
all over the entrances.

09:13.843 --> 09:16.009
Is Arthur cool with
all this surveillance?

09:16.011 --> 09:18.178
Yeah, he said I could
take a few precautions.

09:18.203 --> 09:19.873
This is nothing. In my country,

09:19.898 --> 09:21.582
the secret police were everywhere.

09:21.584 --> 09:23.417
How did you know they
were secret police?

09:23.419 --> 09:24.200
Good point.

09:24.225 --> 09:26.223
Maybe it was just a
bunch of nosy people.

09:26.661 --> 09:28.630
Who abducted my grandfather!

09:29.859 --> 09:31.658
Well, the cameras will
protect Arthur when he's here,

09:31.660 --> 09:33.020
but what about when
he goes out at night?

09:33.045 --> 09:34.411
Oh, I'm way ahead of
you. See, I was thinking

09:34.436 --> 09:35.964
we can all take turns watching over him.

09:35.989 --> 09:39.166
So, I bought this
calendar at the drug store.

09:39.168 --> 09:40.601
Sexy firemen calendar?

09:40.603 --> 09:42.350
It was on sale! All right...

09:42.375 --> 09:44.451
Whoa, whoa, check out those pecs.

09:44.476 --> 09:47.674
Someone call 911, am I right?

09:47.676 --> 09:49.426
Can we focus on the schedule? Thank you.

09:49.590 --> 09:50.711
All right, so I can
do the morning shifts,

09:50.736 --> 09:52.253
but Arthur goes to the bank at night,

09:52.255 --> 09:53.973
so I need someone to
volunteer to walk with him.

09:54.020 --> 09:55.717
I can do Mondays after school.

09:55.742 --> 09:57.151
- Okay.
- I'm free Thursdays.

09:57.153 --> 09:58.152
Thursdays.

09:58.154 --> 09:59.827
How much time does he spend in the gym?

09:59.852 --> 10:02.554
I mean, that's like an eight-pack.

10:03.292 --> 10:06.121
Put me down for abs-days.
I mean Wednesdays.

10:07.188 --> 10:09.738
Arthur, glad you're here, man.

10:09.763 --> 10:11.645
So, look, I had an idea, all right,

10:11.684 --> 10:13.340
um, that we'd all,
you know, accompany you

10:13.365 --> 10:14.868
while you walked
around the neighborhood.

10:14.870 --> 10:17.171
So you'll be babysitting me, huh?

10:17.173 --> 10:18.177
Nah, not at all.

10:18.179 --> 10:19.786
It's just friends looking
after another friend.

10:19.811 --> 10:21.742
Look, look, I'm not a pathetic old man.

10:21.744 --> 10:24.346
You know, I'm perfectly capable
of taking care of myself.

10:24.371 --> 10:26.604
We talked about this,
man. You need to be safe.

10:26.629 --> 10:28.409
I agree, which is why I bought this.

10:28.434 --> 10:29.967
Oh!

10:31.304 --> 10:33.038
We're going to be on the news!

10:38.112 --> 10:39.205
Where'd you get that?

10:39.307 --> 10:40.392
I went to a gun show.

10:40.417 --> 10:42.431
Man, do they hate Obama.

10:43.445 --> 10:45.298
We never talked about you getting a gun.

10:45.323 --> 10:46.884
Hey, come on, come on,
you're the one that wanted me

10:46.909 --> 10:48.876
to be safe from all the
criminals, right, huh?

10:48.947 --> 10:50.713
So now I got a gun, now I'm safe.

10:50.715 --> 10:52.815
Mind if I take a look at that?

10:52.817 --> 10:56.653
Looks like a Beretta
92FS, double-action,

10:56.655 --> 10:58.555
semiautomatic, nine-millimeter.

10:58.557 --> 11:01.858
15-round magazine. Yep.

11:01.860 --> 11:03.927
You're definitely gonna
blow your head off.

11:03.929 --> 11:05.094
Thanks.

11:05.996 --> 11:07.463
How do you know so much about guns?

11:07.465 --> 11:09.201
I used to work in a liquor store.

11:11.607 --> 11:14.271
Wait until Jerry finds
out that Arthur has a gun.

11:14.472 --> 11:15.705
Who's Jerry?

11:15.707 --> 11:17.740
My scarecop.

11:17.742 --> 11:19.909
I like to imagine his
life before he met me.

11:19.911 --> 11:22.912
You know, he started out
as a menswear mannequin,

11:22.914 --> 11:26.149
but became a cop because he
wanted to make a difference.

11:26.151 --> 11:29.185
Now he's two weeks from
retirement, and, uh...

11:29.187 --> 11:32.855
I have a lot of down
time at the dry cleaners!

11:32.857 --> 11:35.525
Arthur, look, I'm just
trying to protect you.

11:35.527 --> 11:37.272
So why do you want to take my gun away?

11:37.297 --> 11:39.362
Maybe because studies
prove that a gun in the home

11:39.364 --> 11:42.098
poses a greater threat to
family members than to intruders.

11:42.100 --> 11:44.934
That's true, but in states
where gun ownership goes up,

11:44.936 --> 11:46.369
violent crime goes down.

11:46.371 --> 11:49.038
- Yeah, but 86% of...
- Who cares?!

11:49.040 --> 11:51.107
Like, 100% of Arthur
owns a gun right now,

11:51.109 --> 11:53.576
which makes me a million
percent freaked out.

11:53.578 --> 11:56.079
But why? Now you're protected.

11:56.081 --> 11:58.081
If a bad guy comes into the shop,

11:58.083 --> 12:00.362
Arthur can just boom-boom, boom-boom!

12:02.386 --> 12:04.421
That's shooting, not dancing.

12:06.530 --> 12:07.724
Wait, do you own a gun?

12:07.726 --> 12:09.359
Guns.

12:09.361 --> 12:12.028
And also no.

12:12.030 --> 12:14.230
- This is Chicago, okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

12:14.232 --> 12:16.013
I knew a lot of guys
who thought having a gun

12:16.038 --> 12:18.167
would make them feel
safer, and it didn't.

12:18.169 --> 12:19.502
It just got them shot.

12:19.504 --> 12:21.771
Randy, James, we got a situation.

12:21.773 --> 12:23.573
Arthur bought a gun;
you got to stop him.

12:23.575 --> 12:24.874
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

12:24.876 --> 12:26.776
Is it registered? You got a permit?

12:26.778 --> 12:27.668
Yes.

12:27.693 --> 12:29.535
Well, then I can't stop him.

12:29.560 --> 12:32.615
And the way crime's been
lately, it's not a half-bad idea.

12:32.617 --> 12:33.984
So you're just cool with this?

12:34.009 --> 12:36.753
Well, if he's a responsible
gun owner, I'm fine.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.254
I don't know. As a police officer,

12:38.256 --> 12:39.589
I've seen way too many people

12:39.591 --> 12:40.923
hurt themselves with their own gun.

12:40.925 --> 12:42.191
- Mm-hmm. 
- He shot himself.

12:42.193 --> 12:43.726
I shot myself.

12:45.296 --> 12:46.488
Well, you don't have to worry about me.

12:46.513 --> 12:48.231
I've handled a gun.
I've been in the Army.

12:48.233 --> 12:49.293
You were a cook.

12:49.318 --> 12:50.664
A pastry chef.

12:51.069 --> 12:53.736
Yeah, but believe me, I've
seen a lot of stuff go down.

12:53.738 --> 12:55.838
Like what, a soufflé?

12:55.840 --> 12:58.174
Randy, come on, please help me out here.

12:58.176 --> 12:59.409
All right, look, Arthur,

12:59.411 --> 13:01.344
if you're really serious about this,

13:01.346 --> 13:03.079
we're gonna do it the safe way.

13:03.081 --> 13:05.088
I'm gonna take you to the shooting range

13:05.113 --> 13:06.199
and make sure you can handle that thing.

13:06.224 --> 13:08.851
All right, fine, if that'll
make everybody comfortable.

13:08.853 --> 13:09.852
I'm going, too.

13:09.854 --> 13:11.654
I want to see if I should invest

13:11.656 --> 13:14.000
in a Kevlar apron and
a bulletproof hairnet.

13:14.039 --> 13:16.726
Come on, it's just a gun.
How complicated can it be?

13:19.029 --> 13:20.553
Happens to me all the time.

13:24.335 --> 13:26.735
Bam! Bam! Bam!

13:26.760 --> 13:28.127
Get out of my shop!

13:28.158 --> 13:29.639
Those donuts might be filled with jelly,

13:29.641 --> 13:31.574
but I'm about to fill you with lead!

13:31.576 --> 13:33.042
Bam! Bam!

13:33.044 --> 13:34.744
- Would you stop saying "bam"?
- Huh?

13:34.746 --> 13:36.245
The guns make the noises for you.

13:36.247 --> 13:37.680
Oh.

13:37.682 --> 13:39.615
I'm sorry. I got carried away.

13:39.617 --> 13:41.751
Okay, let's see the damage.

13:46.790 --> 13:49.556
Good news, they can use this one again.

13:50.970 --> 13:52.428
There must be something
wrong with that target.

13:52.430 --> 13:54.497
You know, in basketball,
I used to blame the hoop

13:54.499 --> 13:57.066
until I realized I just suck.

13:57.068 --> 13:59.869
Arthur, this, uh, gun thing
may just not be for you.

13:59.871 --> 14:01.504
Why don't we get you a whistle

14:01.506 --> 14:03.439
- and some pepper spray?
- Oh, wonderful.

14:03.441 --> 14:05.503
Does that come with kitten
heels and a girdle, hmm?

14:06.845 --> 14:08.678
What year do you think it is?

14:08.680 --> 14:10.513
Look, Arthur, we gave it a try.

14:10.515 --> 14:12.315
Yeah, man.

14:12.317 --> 14:14.384
Gun is not for you,
especially at your age.

14:14.386 --> 14:16.819
All right, all right.

14:16.821 --> 14:20.089
I'll give up the gun, if
that'll get you off my back.

14:20.091 --> 14:21.257
Yes, it would.

14:21.259 --> 14:22.258
And will you stop hanging out

14:22.260 --> 14:23.659
at 4:00 a.m. in your robe?

14:23.661 --> 14:25.328
All right, I'll wait
for the sun to rise,

14:25.330 --> 14:26.929
like a damn rooster.

14:26.931 --> 14:29.634
Just tie your robe, so I don't
see your cock-a-doodle-doo.

14:31.704 --> 14:32.802
Oh.

14:34.271 --> 14:37.640
Look, a little present
for my ex-husband.

14:41.478 --> 14:42.678
Shall we go?

15:03.367 --> 15:05.067
- Arthur, no!
- Oh, my God! Oh, geez!

15:06.371 --> 15:08.171
I almost shot you.

15:08.173 --> 15:10.339
You said you got rid of that.

15:11.005 --> 15:13.142
I just wanted you to get off my back.

15:13.144 --> 15:14.811
Why are you following me?

15:14.813 --> 15:16.879
'Cause I knew you were lying.

15:18.015 --> 15:19.382
Just hand it over, okay?

15:19.384 --> 15:20.383
All right.

15:22.053 --> 15:24.086
Drop the gun.

15:24.088 --> 15:28.524
Okay, close your robe,
then drop the gun.

15:32.896 --> 15:34.897
Well, I have to say I'm impressed.

15:34.899 --> 15:37.567
How'd you manage to wrestle a
gun away from this young man?

15:37.569 --> 15:38.868
Huh?

15:38.870 --> 15:40.903
Why you assume I was robbing him?

15:40.905 --> 15:42.271
It was his gun.

15:42.273 --> 15:44.941
And what would I want to
steal from him, his flip phone?

15:44.943 --> 15:47.009
Ah, we have a motive.

15:47.011 --> 15:48.144
Yeah, you got me.

15:48.146 --> 15:51.447
I'm the uptown
obsolete-technology bandit.

15:51.449 --> 15:53.732
And a confession.

15:53.771 --> 15:55.751
Oh, come on, would you stop it?

15:55.753 --> 15:57.820
It was my gun. He works for me.

15:57.822 --> 16:00.323
Have you called Officer DeLuca yet, huh?

16:00.325 --> 16:02.158
I told you, she'll vouch for us.

16:02.160 --> 16:03.593
Yeah, she said she's on the way,

16:03.595 --> 16:05.995
she just needs a cup of coffee first.

16:07.331 --> 16:09.565
- All right, you guys hang tight.
- All right.

16:13.070 --> 16:15.705
Damn, I almost killed you.

16:15.707 --> 16:19.141
Yeah, you could have.

16:19.143 --> 16:21.744
Now can you give up the gun?

16:23.180 --> 16:26.115
I guess it's obvious I
shouldn't be carrying one.

16:26.117 --> 16:29.585
But I'm not gonna let you scare
me out of living my own life.

16:29.587 --> 16:30.753
Do you understand?

16:30.755 --> 16:31.676
Okay.

16:32.418 --> 16:33.465
I'll back off.

16:34.726 --> 16:35.892
All right.

16:35.894 --> 16:37.593
Look, man, you...

16:37.595 --> 16:40.997
you at least have to let me
put up some bars on the windows

16:40.999 --> 16:43.332
or some cameras or something.

16:43.334 --> 16:46.669
Can I still get the newspaper by myself?

16:46.671 --> 16:48.738
Can you wait till the sun comes up?

16:48.740 --> 16:53.042
Or read the news online
like everyone else under 90?

16:53.044 --> 16:54.551
I'll wait till the sun comes up.

16:54.576 --> 16:55.629
Thank you.

16:57.262 --> 16:58.948
And, look, I'm-I'm
sorry I got in your head.

16:58.950 --> 17:00.616
All right.

17:00.618 --> 17:03.119
But I lost a lot of friends
to guns in this damn city,

17:03.121 --> 17:04.387
all right?

17:04.973 --> 17:07.390
And I can't stand the
thought of losing another one.

17:07.392 --> 17:10.726
Oh, so now I'm your friend, huh?

17:12.194 --> 17:14.696
Not if you keep making my
emotional moments about you.

17:15.900 --> 17:17.433
Selfish bastard.

17:17.435 --> 17:19.101
- All right, bring it in, man.
- Yeah.

17:19.103 --> 17:20.295
- No, no.
- Where...

17:20.319 --> 17:22.633
No, over. There.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.007
Are you okay, sir?! Is
he trying to assault you?!

17:25.009 --> 17:26.642
Oh, stop it, will you?!

17:26.644 --> 17:27.877
- Randy, hey!
- Hey!

17:27.878 --> 17:30.146
- Randy.
- Hey, Randy.

17:31.281 --> 17:33.783
Go ahead. Go for it.

17:33.785 --> 17:35.851
So, DeLuca, were you on a date,

17:35.853 --> 17:38.888
or did you get a job
as a blackjack dealer?

17:38.890 --> 17:42.658
No, but he was 21.

17:42.660 --> 17:44.652
And I did tell him to hit it.

17:47.164 --> 17:48.864
Solid. Nice one.

17:48.866 --> 17:49.932
All right, look.

17:49.934 --> 17:52.559
He's cool, and he's cool.

17:52.584 --> 17:54.537
So are you cool if I take it from here?

17:54.539 --> 17:56.706
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

17:56.708 --> 17:58.240
- Bye.
- All right, all right.

17:58.242 --> 17:59.909
Thank you, Randy.

17:59.911 --> 18:02.945
Well, I guess I got to start
making the donuts now, huh?

18:02.947 --> 18:05.648
Good. Kill people the
old-fashioned way...

18:05.650 --> 18:07.316
With heart disease and diabetes.

18:07.318 --> 18:08.317
Yeah.

18:09.185 --> 18:10.863
- Thanks, Randy.
- Well, where you going with those?

18:10.888 --> 18:13.089
I told you, I have a date.

18:20.257 --> 18:23.126
All right, got two cameras in the shop,

18:23.128 --> 18:25.462
two outside, and two upstairs
in Arthur's apartment.

18:25.464 --> 18:27.931
And all the cameras are
linked to this app on my phone.

18:27.933 --> 18:29.733
Where is Arthur, anyway?

18:29.735 --> 18:31.118
Haven't seen him all morning.

18:31.143 --> 18:33.770
He's running an errand,
but he just got back.

18:33.772 --> 18:36.206
- How do you know?
- Well, look.

18:39.076 --> 18:42.512
Ooh. Yeah, that fish-eye
lens is not his friend.

18:43.613 --> 18:47.083
Whoa! It wasn't the lens.

18:47.085 --> 18:50.253
Well, hopefully we won't be
seeing much on those cameras.

18:50.255 --> 18:51.835
The extra police presence

18:51.860 --> 18:53.009
is starting to make a difference.

18:53.034 --> 18:56.244
That's right. Crime in
uptown is trending downtown.

18:58.163 --> 19:00.463
In my head, that was hilarious.

19:00.670 --> 19:03.099
I'm just glad we can
stop working so hard.

19:05.303 --> 19:06.202
Come with me!

19:06.204 --> 19:08.805
Some kids just stole my scarecop!

19:08.807 --> 19:11.113
Come on, Hawaii Five-Slow, let's go!

19:12.277 --> 19:13.610
It's all you, James.

19:13.612 --> 19:15.111
All right, I'm on it.

19:15.113 --> 19:17.614
Yes! We can watch the
chase on my phone, look.

19:17.616 --> 19:18.642
Let's see.

19:19.034 --> 19:21.718
Oh! Mannequin cop down!

19:21.720 --> 19:23.620
No, that's James.

19:24.305 --> 19:30.391
