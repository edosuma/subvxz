<i>I am hoping that you will be

It's the 4th movement of

- "The Ode to Joy."
- His final symphony.

That's correct. [CHUCKLING]

06:01.330 --> 06:03.520
The year was 1978,

06:03.530 --> 06:04.820
I was in the 3rd grade,

06:04.900 --> 06:07.259
you were teaching us all music.

06:09.820 --> 06:11.799
what to play for the spring concert.

06:26.550 --> 06:28.249
[LAUGHING]

06:28.250 --> 06:31.400
You said, while the music
might be exciting to us,

06:31.410 --> 06:32.920
it was highly derivative

06:32.980 --> 06:35.639
and wasn't worth our attention.

06:35.640 --> 06:37.180
Ha!

06:37.460 --> 06:39.560
Then...

06:39.660 --> 06:41.899
you told us...

06:41.900 --> 06:45.670
about Ludwig van Beethoven.

06:45.760 --> 06:51.109
His dark and fiery
compositions made him a star,

06:51.110 --> 06:53.640
and yet, his personal life

06:53.660 --> 06:58.140
was filled with pain
and deeply troubled.

06:59.050 --> 07:01.420
Which got even worse as
he lost his hearing.

07:01.440 --> 07:03.580
Can you imagine the ultimate tragedy?

07:03.690 --> 07:07.240
A composer losing their hearing.

07:07.860 --> 07:11.720
And that for the final movement
of his final symphony,

07:11.760 --> 07:16.259
in a stroke of irony,
he composed an ode...

07:16.260 --> 07:19.429
- <i>to joy.</i>
- To joy.

07:19.430 --> 07:20.819
<i>He even brought in a chorus</i>

07:20.820 --> 07:22.180
<i>to sing along with the music.</i>

07:22.220 --> 07:24.070
Yes, yes.

07:27.540 --> 07:30.279
Well, needless to say, the
children of the class

07:30.280 --> 07:33.479

Joy" for me that day.

07:40.990 --> 07:43.159
For teaching me that even though a man

07:43.160 --> 07:45.160
may live a deeply troubled life

07:45.320 --> 07:48.660
and come up against...

07:48.740 --> 07:51.399
unbelievable obstacles

07:51.400 --> 07:54.169
over which he has no control,

07:54.170 --> 07:57.720
to which he might be an innocent victim,

07:57.760 --> 08:00.439
<i>even if he's... </i>

08:00.440 --> 08:04.740
<i>drowning in darkness and fear</i>

08:12.790 --> 08:16.760
to... end their life

08:17.240 --> 08:20.160

08:26.370 --> 08:29.299

09:19.520 --> 09:21.590
Uh, I'm sorry?

09:21.780 --> 09:25.139
Well, you remembered the
first portion of the day,

09:25.140 --> 09:28.780
I'm assuming you remember the
portion that followed after.

[MIRTHLESS CHUCKLE]

But that's the most seminal
part of it for me.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.439
That's the part that
affected me the most,

09:38.440 --> 09:41.340
you and me alone together

09:43.210 --> 09:47.180
That's what... made me

Do you remember?

10:00.990 --> 10:03.060
Let me refresh your memory.

10:05.180 --> 10:08.299
So, the kids voted for <i> Star Wars.</i>

10:08.300 --> 10:10.769
You were disappointed,
but you handled it well.

10:10.770 --> 10:12.220
And then the bell rang,

10:12.250 --> 10:14.819
and all of the other children left.

10:14.820 --> 10:19.690
And I came up to you and I said

10:19.700 --> 10:21.729
that I really loved "Ode to Joy"

10:21.730 --> 10:23.060
and I wanted to vote for it,

10:23.100 --> 10:25.600
but I was afraid the other
kids would make fun of me.

10:25.700 --> 10:29.639
So I copped out and I
voted for <i> Star Wars,</i> too.

10:29.640 --> 10:31.869
And you were very sweet about it,

10:31.870 --> 10:34.299
and you forgave me for voting for

10:34.300 --> 10:36.300
<i>Star Wars</i> and not for Beethoven.

10:37.250 --> 10:39.160
<i>Then I turned to go,</i>

10:39.220 --> 10:40.550
<i>and then you stopped me and said</i>

10:40.620 --> 10:43.520
could I stay for a few minutes.

10:45.020 --> 10:47.590
Do you remember that?

10:48.860 --> 10:51.089
I... I'm sorry, Jim, I...

10:51.090 --> 10:53.680
- I should be going.
- Just one... one minute.

10:53.700 --> 10:54.990
Please.

10:56.430 --> 10:57.930
So...

10:58.080 --> 11:01.280
you asked me to take out my
trumpet... that trumpet...

11:01.400 --> 11:04.200
<i>and you handed me the sheet
music for "Ode to Joy"</i>

11:04.210 --> 11:05.939
<i>and asked me to play along with you.</i>

11:05.940 --> 11:07.280
I was thrilled.

11:07.360 --> 11:09.100

<i>and I did,</i>

11:14.630 --> 11:17.450
<i>and then we started to play,</i>

11:18.950 --> 11:20.400

<i>and you played brilliantly.</i>

<i>and nodded in encouragement.</i>

11:29.760 --> 11:33.769
<i>And it made me feel
so good about myself.</i>

11:33.770 --> 11:35.120

or, even more likely, that
what was so seminal for me

14:38.580 --> 14:41.580
was merely commonplace for you.

14:42.980 --> 14:47.820
So, where were we? Ah, yes.

14:48.590 --> 14:51.679
Sitting down, your hand on my knee,

14:51.680 --> 14:52.899
the door was closed.

14:52.900 --> 14:54.220
You remember what you said to me?

14:54.260 --> 14:56.840
You said, "Jim...

14:57.600 --> 14:59.969
I believe...

14:59.970 --> 15:02.770
that anything is
possible in this world."

15:04.810 --> 15:08.839
I remember basking in the
warm glow of your smile,

15:08.840 --> 15:10.700
and for a moment I believed

15:10.720 --> 15:12.380
that maybe I could
have a beautiful life,

15:12.400 --> 15:16.120
maybe I could be a composer one day,

15:16.140 --> 15:17.920
like Beethoven.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.500
And then...

15:20.600 --> 15:23.840
<i>just like that... [SNAPS FINGERS]</i>

15:23.880 --> 15:25.620
you took it away.

15:27.540 --> 15:29.430
You erased it.

15:30.840 --> 15:32.930
And do you know why?

15:38.070 --> 15:40.040
You teleported.

15:45.420 --> 15:48.580
From right over here,
to right over there.

15:49.180 --> 15:50.940
<i>Thirty feet.</i>

15:51.040 --> 15:53.100
From the piano to behind the desk.

15:53.690 --> 15:55.450
<i>Whoosh!</i>

15:55.460 --> 15:57.889
Just like that.

15:57.890 --> 16:00.760
And I... I was shocked.
I... I couldn't believe it.

16:00.860 --> 16:03.040
<i>So I quickly asked you about it,</i>

16:03.110 --> 16:07.379
<i>and, even more strangely, you</i> denied <i> it.</i>

16:07.380 --> 16:10.100
<i>And I wanted to find the truth.</i>

16:10.160 --> 16:12.019
So I asked you again.
You denied it again.

16:12.020 --> 16:13.140
Back and forth we went...

16:13.160 --> 16:16.189
for four minutes this
conversation went on.

16:16.190 --> 16:19.480
Well, finally, I... I
started doubting myself.

16:19.760 --> 16:21.960
<i>Do you know what that's like?</i>

16:21.970 --> 16:24.920
<i>When part of you deeply believes
that something is true,</i>

16:25.200 --> 16:27.779
and another part of you

16:27.780 --> 16:30.700
doubts yourself to your very core?

16:31.110 --> 16:33.409
Until you start to doubt...

16:33.410 --> 16:35.340
any experience you might have.

16:36.510 --> 16:38.260
Oh...

16:38.920 --> 16:41.900
it's... it's dark.

16:42.260 --> 16:44.840
It's a lot darker than...

16:45.220 --> 16:47.689
the life of Ludwig van Beethoven,

16:47.690 --> 16:49.340
<i>I'll tell ya that.</i>

16:51.190 --> 16:54.529
Makes it impossible to
get close to anyone.

16:54.530 --> 16:59.680
Because you know something they can't,

16:59.880 --> 17:03.469
and even if you do get close enough

17:03.470 --> 17:05.460
to confess it to someone, like, say,

17:05.470 --> 17:07.239
your college girlfriend,

17:07.240 --> 17:10.810
oh... it doesn't go very well.

17:12.550 --> 17:14.749
<i>So then you keep it a secret.</i>

17:14.750 --> 17:18.839
But that creates a wall
between you and other people.

17:19.220 --> 17:21.720
You talk to therapists,
to psychiatrists,

17:21.740 --> 17:24.259
to hypnotists, and no one believes you,

17:24.260 --> 17:28.029
and even the medication stops
working the way it should,

17:28.030 --> 17:31.200
which makes you doubt
yourself even more.

17:34.340 --> 17:37.880
So what do you do? You
work a menial job, and...

17:38.810 --> 17:41.340
you just get by.

17:44.180 --> 17:46.579
Until, finally...

17:46.580 --> 17:49.119
you come to the terrifying conclusion

17:49.120 --> 17:52.920
that even though it makes
no earthly sense...

17:53.420 --> 17:58.559
that Mr. Mulvahill, the baseball
coach and music teacher,

17:58.560 --> 18:02.190
harbors the powers of teleportation,

18:02.200 --> 18:05.060
you know what you saw!

18:05.070 --> 18:07.169
And you believe it...

18:07.170 --> 18:09.680
no matter what anyone else says.

18:09.780 --> 18:11.600
<i>Now, I know what you're thinking.</i>

18:11.680 --> 18:16.279
Why wait 40 years to
confront you about it?

18:16.280 --> 18:18.609
Well, that's a very good question.

18:18.610 --> 18:22.779
Believe me, I have been
thinking about this every day,

18:22.780 --> 18:25.880
multiple times a day,
for the past 40 years.

18:25.890 --> 18:28.359
<i>Who and what you might be,</i>

18:28.360 --> 18:32.659
and why you did what you did to me.

18:32.660 --> 18:35.470
Now, ultimately,

18:35.480 --> 18:40.380
I decided that I can live
without knowing why.

18:40.570 --> 18:43.630
But mm-mm. What I can't stand

18:43.660 --> 18:48.880
is the .001 percent chance
that it didn't happen.

18:49.740 --> 18:51.610
What if I'm crazy?

18:53.550 --> 18:57.219
What if I... blinked

18:57.220 --> 18:59.519
or had a blackout,

18:59.520 --> 19:01.990
and there was no
teleportation whatsoever?

19:03.860 --> 19:07.359
That's when I knew I
needed to confront you,

19:07.360 --> 19:10.490
I needed to speak to you,
try and get the truth.

19:10.500 --> 19:13.929
And, well, we went through that,

19:13.930 --> 19:17.720
and it worked out just
as I thought: fruitless.

19:17.840 --> 19:20.520
<i>So then I thought, well,
why not capture him</i>

19:20.540 --> 19:23.100
and threaten his life until
he tells me the truth?

19:23.120 --> 19:25.120
Well, look, you and I both know

19:25.140 --> 19:27.979
that if my life were threatened

19:27.980 --> 19:30.479
unless I admitted to
something ridiculous,

19:30.480 --> 19:33.119
like, say, I don't know,
I had 39 testicles,

19:33.120 --> 19:34.480
I would do it. Of course.

19:34.490 --> 19:35.950
I would lie. Wouldn't you?

19:35.960 --> 19:37.859
<i>Of course you would.</i>

19:37.860 --> 19:41.259
<i>And that's why I've never
confronted you before.</i>

19:41.260 --> 19:46.300
I could never figure out a strategy...

19:46.920 --> 19:49.199
to come up with the truth.

19:49.200 --> 19:52.070
Then, one day, when I
was eating Corn Pops

19:52.080 --> 19:54.269
and listening to <i>This American Life,</i>

19:54.270 --> 19:56.809
it hit me like a bolt of lightning.

19:56.810 --> 19:58.319
Ha ha!

19:58.320 --> 19:59.980
Of course!

20:00.120 --> 20:04.110
If I tell him that he's
only got 60 seconds

20:04.120 --> 20:07.540
before I put this baseball
bat through his skull,

20:07.560 --> 20:10.059
<i>well, that should give
him enough time, right?</i>

20:10.060 --> 20:11.919
If he can teleport, he will.

20:11.920 --> 20:15.000
Because if not... he's dead.

the right thing to do.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.770

20:33.780 --> 20:35.540
