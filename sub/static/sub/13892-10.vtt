00:12.374 --> 00:14.714
Dude! I'm open, I'm open, dude!

00:15.184 --> 00:16.554
Go long, dude!

00:18.004 --> 00:19.944
Touchdown, sock faces!

00:23.374 --> 00:24.454
Hey, you two!

00:24.534 --> 00:27.494
Quit fooling around, we're having an emergency meeting.

00:27.524 --> 00:29.054
Aw, what?

00:30.154 --> 00:31.774
Outside, now!

00:34.414 --> 00:35.634
Alright, everyone.

00:35.654 --> 00:37.124
I got some bad news.

00:37.174 --> 00:38.834
The park is being audited.

00:38.894 --> 00:41.314
Pops tried to pay the park taxes...

00:41.314 --> 00:42.834
...with lollipops.

00:44.274 --> 00:46.744
But I gave them more than enough!

00:46.934 --> 00:48.614
We already went over this, Pops.

00:48.614 --> 00:52.064
You pay taxes with money, not lollipops.

00:54.144 --> 00:56.914
What's the big deal? It's not like an audit is a bad thing.

00:57.034 --> 00:59.774
It is a bad thing, Rigby.

00:59.834 --> 01:01.334
If we don't take care of this,

01:01.344 --> 01:03.444
the government takes our stuff away!

01:05.244 --> 01:08.544
Okay, we only have till 3 to stop the audit.

01:08.574 --> 01:10.994
Does anyone know someone who can help us?

01:10.994 --> 01:11.724
Anybody?

01:12.004 --> 01:13.094
Anybody at all?

01:13.214 --> 01:16.224
I know someone who can help.

01:16.274 --> 01:18.344
If you say your mom, you're fired!

01:19.564 --> 01:21.344
MY MOM!

01:21.344 --> 01:23.994
- GET OUT! - It was worth it!

01:27.464 --> 01:30.144
Hey! We know someone!

01:30.194 --> 01:31.294
We do?

01:32.534 --> 01:34.294
No! No way!

01:34.354 --> 01:37.264
What?! If you know somebody, you've got to tell me.

01:37.284 --> 01:38.414
Rigby has a brother.

01:38.804 --> 01:40.074
And he's an accountant.

01:40.644 --> 01:41.774
Shut up!

01:41.804 --> 01:44.204
Dude, what do you have against Don?

01:47.284 --> 01:48.854
Guys! Guys! Guys!

01:48.854 --> 01:50.584
Watch me blow out the candles, guys!

01:51.154 --> 01:51.984
Hey, Rigby!

01:52.144 --> 01:53.284
Happy birthday, bro!

01:54.284 --> 01:56.734
Wha?! Wha?! I told you to stay in the basement!

01:56.834 --> 01:58.214
Oh! Sorry, Rigby.

01:58.254 --> 02:00.144
I just wanted to give you some birthday sugar.

02:00.144 --> 02:01.694
I don't want your freakin' sugar!

02:01.694 --> 02:03.444
I'll give you some sugar, Don.

02:03.444 --> 02:04.714
Yeah, me too!

02:07.894 --> 02:09.133
Don't you dare!

02:09.214 --> 02:10.973
I'm just getting some sugar, dude!

02:11.064 --> 02:13.024
Besides, Don is cool.

02:14.384 --> 02:15.984
You're the best, Don!

02:19.384 --> 02:22.154
Yeah. Don really made that party.

02:22.254 --> 02:23.734
- Call your brother! - No!

02:23.734 --> 02:26.404
- Call your brother! - No! I hate him!

02:26.574 --> 02:28.664
Fine. Mordecai, you call him.

02:28.704 --> 02:29.894
You better not!

02:29.954 --> 02:31.754
Dude, he could save the park!

02:31.754 --> 02:33.414
Dude, he could ruin my life!

02:33.414 --> 02:35.224
If he comes, I'm gonna tell him to leave!

02:35.304 --> 02:38.664
No, you won't! You be nice to your brother or you're FIRED!

02:38.664 --> 02:39.714
Call him.

02:40.044 --> 02:42.684
Dude, just be cool until he stops the audit.

02:45.364 --> 02:47.794
You guys are making a big mistake!

02:47.824 --> 02:49.944
Don't ruin this for us, Rigby.

02:57.614 --> 02:59.304
Really nice car.

03:01.294 --> 03:03.224
He looks just like Rigby!

03:04.804 --> 03:06.604
Did somebody order an accountant?

03:07.794 --> 03:10.564
Thank you so much for coming on such short notice.

03:10.574 --> 03:11.484
I'm Benson.

03:11.754 --> 03:13.784
Benson! Give me some sugar.

03:14.394 --> 03:15.404
Nice to meet you.

03:18.064 --> 03:20.464
- Hey, who's this guy? - I'm Pops.

03:20.624 --> 03:22.554
Pops! Give me some sugar.

03:29.594 --> 03:31.254
Don. Good to meet ya.

03:32.444 --> 03:34.484
Look at this sugar shack.

03:34.524 --> 03:35.774
Come here, guy!

03:36.234 --> 03:37.894
I haven't seen you in forever.

03:38.274 --> 03:39.694
Yeah, I know!

03:39.814 --> 03:40.944
Oh, it's been forever.

03:40.944 --> 03:42.484
Rigby...

03:42.564 --> 03:44.224
give me some sugar, bro.

03:44.344 --> 03:46.054
Don't you have taxis to do?

03:46.044 --> 03:47.294
Why don't you get to it?

03:48.364 --> 03:50.194
He was always greedy with the sugar.

03:51.174 --> 03:53.254
I can't wait for you to get out of my life!

03:53.324 --> 03:53.994
What, bro?

03:54.484 --> 03:56.364
You keep your mouth shut!

03:57.244 --> 03:58.364
Nothing.

03:59.174 --> 04:00.474
So then I said,

04:00.474 --> 04:03.884
"you're not an accountant, you're an account-can't!"

04:07.164 --> 04:10.904
I didn't realize accounting could be so fascinating.

04:10.944 --> 04:13.514
I'm just lucky I get do what I love.

04:13.514 --> 04:16.603
"Ohh, I'm just lucky I get to do what I love."

04:16.603 --> 04:19.314
Rigbone! Sugar?

04:19.344 --> 04:21.233
Shouldn't you be fixing the augit?

04:21.233 --> 04:22.494
You mean the audit?

04:22.524 --> 04:24.414
Don't correct me! I know what it is!

04:25.194 --> 04:26.524
Whoa, there.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.544
I'm sensing some tension, bro.

04:28.694 --> 04:31.494
I think it's time we all take a well-deserved break.

04:34.924 --> 04:36.534
Mordo! Go long!

04:37.154 --> 04:38.274
I got it!

04:42.614 --> 04:44.364
Hello, "Mordo".

04:44.644 --> 04:46.484
Enjoying your game?

04:46.524 --> 04:48.654
Uh, sure, dude.

04:48.854 --> 04:50.014
Can you pass the ball?

04:50.714 --> 04:53.024
- Rigby! - He's not even doing the dabit!

04:53.024 --> 04:54.164
It's audit!

04:55.354 --> 04:58.224
Rigby, why don't you just try being nice to your brother?

04:58.264 --> 04:59.514
He's actually pretty cool.

05:00.364 --> 05:01.514
You don't get it! He...

05:01.514 --> 05:03.714
Hey, Mordo! We playing or what?!

05:03.714 --> 05:05.354
Uh, yeah, coming!

05:09.114 --> 05:11.274
Ah, I just about got this.

05:11.444 --> 05:12.924
With a few minutes to spare.

05:14.254 --> 05:15.594
Rigbone!

05:15.594 --> 05:18.334
How about a little pre-saving the park sugar?

05:18.604 --> 05:21.124
You know, for almost being done saving the park?

05:21.424 --> 05:22.454
NO!

05:23.034 --> 05:24.654
What's going on with us?

05:24.694 --> 05:26.284
You never give me some sugar.

05:26.724 --> 05:27.894
Did I do something?

05:27.944 --> 05:30.244
Yeah. You were born!

05:32.114 --> 05:32.974
That's heavy.

05:33.764 --> 05:34.784
I gotta get out of here.

05:35.974 --> 05:38.124
Dude? No, wait Don!

05:38.184 --> 05:41.084
I'm sorry. I just gotta get out of here.

05:42.844 --> 05:45.424
Dude, what are you doing? He was almost done!

05:45.434 --> 05:47.094
Ah, he's not so cool.

05:47.354 --> 05:49.174
I can finish this up myself.

05:52.484 --> 05:53.104
OK.

05:55.974 --> 05:57.314
Mordecai! Help!

05:57.404 --> 05:58.574
What did you do?

05:58.594 --> 05:59.744
I don't know!

05:59.994 --> 06:01.654
This doesn't make any sense.

06:01.654 --> 06:02.794
No, no, no!

06:03.524 --> 06:05.574
Don, we brought you a cake.

06:05.624 --> 06:08.154
It's almost three - were you able to stop the audit?

06:08.154 --> 06:10.714
Uh, almost done, Benson-bone.

06:10.734 --> 06:12.004
How do I send this thing?

06:12.004 --> 06:14.054
No dude, just call your brother back.

06:14.054 --> 06:15.534
No! I hate him!

06:16.014 --> 06:18.234
Don't... Don't send it! Don't!

06:18.464 --> 06:20.834
Must... push... send!

06:24.834 --> 06:25.654
Crap!

06:25.654 --> 06:28.304
You are late. Begin audit.

06:43.174 --> 06:43.924
Oh, my...

06:43.994 --> 06:45.104
Where's Don?!

06:48.504 --> 06:49.874
Don! Wait!

06:51.534 --> 06:52.614
What happened?!

06:52.674 --> 06:55.574
Rigby blew it! He wouldn't give Don sugar.

06:55.614 --> 06:58.254
What? Go give him some sugar!

06:58.324 --> 06:59.814
Never!

07:03.634 --> 07:05.834
Rigby? Rigby!

07:08.534 --> 07:09.584
Rigby!

07:09.714 --> 07:11.284
Rigby's not here right now.

07:11.354 --> 07:12.874
Quit being so selfish!

07:12.894 --> 07:15.744
The park's disappearing, you have to end this.

07:15.754 --> 07:17.234
Don't tell me what to do!

07:17.254 --> 07:20.064
You don't know what it's like to have a brother, so you don't know!

07:20.174 --> 07:21.974
You're right. I don't have a brother.

07:22.074 --> 07:23.674
But I kinda know what it's like...

07:23.684 --> 07:25.154
cos I have you, dude.

07:25.214 --> 07:26.554
You're like my brother.

07:27.374 --> 07:28.144
Really?

07:28.264 --> 07:30.804
Yeah. You're to me like Don is to you.

07:30.964 --> 07:32.664
I think you're kinda awkward to look at,

07:32.664 --> 07:34.194
and you embarrass me all the time,

07:34.204 --> 07:36.194
and I wish I could trade you in for someone else.

07:36.274 --> 07:37.084
But I don't.

07:37.234 --> 07:38.494
Because you're like my brother.

07:38.584 --> 07:40.494
With brothers you always gotta make do.

07:40.574 --> 07:42.264
And I think you should make do, too.

07:43.794 --> 07:46.414
Now will you please get Don to stop this audit?

07:47.694 --> 07:50.024
Look, I'm glad you guys stopped by but...

07:50.064 --> 07:51.724
I just can't finish the audit.

07:52.084 --> 07:52.804
I'm sorry.

07:53.084 --> 07:54.184
Don, please!

07:54.414 --> 07:56.314
I need your help with the augit, bro.

07:56.494 --> 07:58.774
Why is it so hard for you to give me sugar?

07:58.804 --> 07:59.864
Why do you hate me?

07:59.904 --> 08:01.514
He's mad about the birthday party.

08:01.534 --> 08:02.574
No!

08:02.554 --> 08:04.564
It wasn't just the birthday party.

08:04.894 --> 08:06.264
It's everything.

08:06.884 --> 08:08.384
I'm always in your shadow.

08:08.504 --> 08:10.274
You're so much better than me.

08:10.434 --> 08:11.744
Everyone likes you better,

08:11.734 --> 08:12.994
and to top it all off,

08:13.014 --> 08:15.554
everyone thinks you're my older brother.

08:15.584 --> 08:18.124
I'm the older brother! Me!

08:18.334 --> 08:21.624
Why do all my friends think you're so much cooler than me?

08:42.534 --> 08:44.514
I... I had no idea.

08:44.514 --> 08:45.714
I'm sorry, bro!

08:45.764 --> 08:47.544
I didn't mean to steal your friends!

08:47.584 --> 08:49.514
I was just trying to be cool like you.

08:49.684 --> 08:50.284
Huh?

08:50.324 --> 08:52.174
I've always looked up to you, bro.

08:52.214 --> 08:53.734
I get my hair cut like you,

08:53.734 --> 08:55.054
I try to look like you,

08:55.184 --> 08:57.054
and I don't wear clothes, just like you!

08:57.064 --> 08:59.144
Remember when you started walking around naked?

08:59.184 --> 09:00.954
I thought you were so cool.

09:00.994 --> 09:03.214
Yeah, dude. That was pretty cool.

09:06.804 --> 09:07.594
Alright.

09:07.894 --> 09:09.844
Let's go save your park!

09:29.554 --> 09:30.994
Where's the computer?

09:35.724 --> 09:37.624
Jeez! What did you do, bro?

09:37.624 --> 09:39.594
I tried to do the taxis!

09:39.594 --> 09:41.484
Hold on - this is gonna be close.

09:48.564 --> 09:49.804
Alright, I got it!

09:49.894 --> 09:51.464
I just have to do one more thing.

09:51.504 --> 09:52.524
Do it!

09:56.074 --> 09:57.954
Why isn't anything happening?

09:58.044 --> 09:59.184
Because...

09:59.574 --> 10:01.904
I still need some sugar, bro!

10:01.954 --> 10:03.664
- WHAT?! - Rigby!

10:30.844 --> 10:32.214
Aw, Don!

10:32.204 --> 10:33.634
Do you have to leave already?

10:33.684 --> 10:34.924
Sorry, Mordo,

10:34.994 --> 10:37.314
but an accountant's work is never done.

10:37.464 --> 10:39.344
Thanks for everything, Don.

10:39.344 --> 10:40.854
Do come back soon!

10:42.854 --> 10:45.374
Well, big brother, if you ever need some sugar,

10:45.414 --> 10:46.524
you know who to call.

10:49.624 --> 10:50.714
Later, gators!

10:54.054 --> 10:54.924
Sugar?

10:54.924 --> 10:55.654
Shut up!
