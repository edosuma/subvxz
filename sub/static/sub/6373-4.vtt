00:01.000 --> 00:02.628
<i>[Betty] Previously on Ugly Betty:</i>

00:02.702 --> 00:05.535
- I'm in love with someone else.
- What? Gina Gambarro?

00:05.605 --> 00:06.799
Look what I brought you.

00:06.873 --> 00:09.671
This game has been
on back-order for months. Full price!

00:09.743 --> 00:13.270
I should forgive you because you
couldn't use your employee discount?

00:13.346 --> 00:15.814
- Have you taken your pill?
- I only have a few left.

00:15.882 --> 00:17.042
Dad. Take it.

00:17.117 --> 00:18.311
I'm sorry I let you down.

00:18.385 --> 00:21.252
I'm sorry I hope you'll be
something you're clearly not.

00:21.321 --> 00:25.280
As long as there's this wedge between
them, their relationship is doomed.

00:25.358 --> 00:28.623
Perhaps it's time I drive
that wedge a little deeper.

00:36.469 --> 00:38.403
[Stampeding horse noises]

00:40.807 --> 00:43.799
[Women squealing]

00:43.877 --> 00:47.040
[Amanda giggling] No, I gotta go!

00:48.548 --> 00:50.140
Did I miss it?

00:50.216 --> 00:54.209
Crap! Crap! Crap!

00:54.287 --> 00:56.414
Dignity, Amanda.

00:57.957 --> 01:00.653
I guess it's too late for that now.

01:00.727 --> 01:05.289
Prada trumps passion, Daniel.
Christina just posted the sign-up sheet.

01:05.364 --> 01:08.892
- Sign-up sheet?
- She's cleaning the Closet tomorrow.

01:08.968 --> 01:11.493
The winter fashions
from the last three issues.

01:11.571 --> 01:14.768
Christina gets rid of them
to make room for spring collections.

01:14.841 --> 01:17.571
Freebie couture is the staff perk.

01:17.644 --> 01:20.374
You know, you really should
take a trip down there.

01:20.447 --> 01:22.972
They might have some socks in your size.

01:25.351 --> 01:28.149
- OK.
- That the stuff on Oshi?

01:28.221 --> 01:32.021
Yes. Back issues
with his fall and winter collections,

01:32.092 --> 01:35.892
<i>a profile from last February's
Interview and his autobiography.</i>

01:35.962 --> 01:39.762
<i>- He has an autobiography?
- Oshi on Oshi, by Oshi.</i>

01:41.734 --> 01:44.328
I think those
are supposed to be his glasses.

01:44.404 --> 01:47.271
<i>[Woman] Super-sized icon
of minimal fashion, Oshi,</i>

01:47.340 --> 01:51.640

tomorrow to unveil his spring collection</i>

01:51.711 --> 01:56.774
<i>to the editors of Mode, where
he debuted his collections for years</i>

01:56.850 --> 01:59.717
<i>due to his extremely close friendship</i>

01:59.786 --> 02:02.550
<i>with former editor in chief,
Fey Sommers.</i>

02:02.622 --> 02:07.025
<i>Fey's tragic death
in a fiery car crash last month</i>

02:07.093 --> 02:09.220
<i>left him devastated.</i>

02:09.294 --> 02:13.527
<i>Fey was so... minimal.</i>

02:15.568 --> 02:18.093
<i>And now the question
on everybody's mind:</i>

02:18.171 --> 02:21.732
<i>Will the fashion heavyweight hit it off
with the Fey's replacement,</i>

02:21.808 --> 02:24.800
<i>himbo playboy Daniel Meade?</i>

02:24.878 --> 02:27.176
<i>I'm thinking "No-shi."</i>

02:27.247 --> 02:31.616
- Well, I'm thinking "Ye-shi."
- Thanks, I appreciate that, Betty.

02:31.684 --> 02:35.051
We need Oshi's business.
I have nothing in common with the man.

02:35.121 --> 02:39.683
I don't speak Japanese, I don't wear
white, never eaten an entire shark.

02:39.759 --> 02:40.851
He'll love you.

02:40.927 --> 02:44.886
It's about relationships with Japanese.
My first meal has to be perfect.

02:44.964 --> 02:48.161
You have the chef's table at Masa
on Wednesday night at 8pm.

02:48.234 --> 02:49.360
Oh, I love their uni.

02:49.435 --> 02:52.029
I got you this
Japanese customs and phrase book.

02:52.105 --> 02:55.404
You should also know
that your credit card was rejected.

02:55.475 --> 02:57.909
- That's my personal card.
- The one you gave me.

02:57.977 --> 03:00.741
Betty, you always use
the company card for business.

03:00.813 --> 03:03.373
You're gonna take care
of my expense report?

03:03.449 --> 03:05.883
- Expense report?
- Henry from Accounting

03:05.952 --> 03:09.752
- sent us a memo, says it was due today.
- Today? No, I didn't get this.

03:09.822 --> 03:13.883
- Well, it says you were copied.
- No! No, I didn't get this.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.053
My father's a hard-ass on expenses.

03:16.129 --> 03:18.962
Company's not gonna
reimburse if we turn that in late.

03:19.032 --> 03:22.229
Accounting is giving us
until 10:30 to get it in. Period.

03:22.302 --> 03:24.566
- No exceptions.
- Do you have any receipts?

03:27.807 --> 03:31.402
- You know what to do with them, right?
- [Man] Payroll!

03:34.581 --> 03:36.139
- Mr. Meade.
- Thank you.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.741
- And you are?
- Betty Suarez.

03:39.352 --> 03:41.547
- There you go.
- This is my first paycheck.

03:41.621 --> 03:43.452
Mine too.

03:43.523 --> 03:45.252
- What the...?
- FICA?

03:45.325 --> 03:48.761
Manny Epstein was a good publisher
when Fey was running the show.

03:48.828 --> 03:52.161
She was, however, fiscally responsible.

03:52.232 --> 03:56.726
Daniel... Well, Daniel needs
stronger supervision.

03:56.803 --> 03:59.169
He's a little indulged,
but he's growing up.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.605
He ran through his trust fund
in three years.

04:01.674 --> 04:05.667
For his 28th birthday,
he tried to buy an island and J. Lo.

04:05.745 --> 04:09.681
Shakira. They were wild oats.
He's turned the corner.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.740
We're talking about a magazine.

04:11.818 --> 04:16.584
Why would you want the publisher's job?
It's financial. Budgets, ad sales.

04:16.656 --> 04:17.644
You're creative.

04:17.724 --> 04:21.990
I never said I'd give up my creative
title, just add publisher to it.

04:22.060 --> 04:24.359
Better to keep Daniel reined in.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.921
I'd rather you concentrated
on the job at hand:

04:27.000 --> 04:29.628
Helping Daniel establish
a relationship with Oshi.

04:29.702 --> 04:31.863
His exclusives are worth millions to us.

04:31.938 --> 04:36.739
Oh, he'll make an impression.
I guarantee it.

04:37.877 --> 04:40.505
- The Gucci shoulder bag is mine.
- Nice, but over it.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.844
Those Louboutin boots,
on the other hand...

04:42.915 --> 04:44.940
As if you stand
a chance of getting them.

04:45.018 --> 04:48.579
- I can trade.
- With what? You're last on the list.

04:48.655 --> 04:51.089
All that'll be left
are those Pucci scarves.

04:51.157 --> 04:54.558
I, on the other hand,
have the pick of the Closet,

04:54.627 --> 04:59.462
<i>and numero uno picks the glorious
"it" bag from the House of Gucci.</i>

04:59.532 --> 05:02.729
- Why would you need a pocketbook?
- I need it to trade.

05:02.802 --> 05:05.236
<i>At Mode, fashion is currency.</i>

05:05.305 --> 05:08.741
That's hard for you to understand
because you're very much in debt.

05:08.808 --> 05:11.709
But, for instance, [sniffs]
If I needed a favor from you,

05:11.778 --> 05:14.303
like an invitation
to a Marc Jacobs dinner party,

05:14.380 --> 05:18.009
then I might be persuaded to trade
that favor for my fabulous Gucci bag,

05:18.084 --> 05:19.847
which you so desperately need.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.042
Mmm.

05:27.427 --> 05:28.655
Loiter much?

05:28.728 --> 05:32.926
Oh, um... I need some help,
if you wouldn't mind.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.728
Ah.

05:34.801 --> 05:38.897
- You need a favor.
- Yes, I guess a favor.

05:39.272 --> 05:42.298
I seem to be late in getting in
Daniel's expense report.

05:42.375 --> 05:45.139
I don't know why I didn't get
the memo from Accounting.

05:45.211 --> 05:47.679
Hmm. Must've been lost in the mailroom.

05:47.747 --> 05:48.839
Oops.

05:48.915 --> 05:50.906
And I'm kind of lost on how to do it.

05:50.983 --> 05:53.474
Marc will be happy to help you,
won't you?

05:53.553 --> 05:57.455
Please give Betty the correct form
and then give her a copy of our report.

05:57.523 --> 06:00.321
If she does what we did, she'll be fine.

06:05.164 --> 06:09.066
You realize this means
an unnamed favor at a later date.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.430
I understand. Thank you.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.008
[Both] Taaa.

06:16.075 --> 06:19.442
Oh, oh, oh, oh. [gasps]

06:19.512 --> 06:21.446
It's Betty's memo.

06:21.514 --> 06:25.883
Those boys in the mailroom.
Cute, but so careless.

06:29.922 --> 06:32.447
- Nice bag.
- Oh, thank you.

06:32.525 --> 06:35.426
So... Juan Valdez.

06:35.995 --> 06:38.122
Did it come with a mule?

06:39.232 --> 06:40.563
- Hi!
- You look fabulous!

06:40.633 --> 06:44.592
- Your hair.
- Right, sod off!

06:44.670 --> 06:47.298
Four times a year,
I'm everybody's best friend.

06:47.373 --> 06:52.174
Well, nobody is moving up the list,
OK? Nobody. That includes you, Amanda.

06:53.880 --> 06:56.371
I was late signing up because of my job.

06:56.482 --> 06:59.645
Oh, well, we all know what kind
of a job you were giving... doing.

07:00.153 --> 07:03.020
Well, where were you?
I would've let you cut the queue.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.887
You don't have
anything larger than a size six.

07:05.958 --> 07:07.653
I have accessories.

07:07.727 --> 07:10.719
I know it sounds stupid,
but I'm just not that into fashion.

07:10.797 --> 07:12.628
Forget fashion. Get your paycheck?

07:12.698 --> 07:15.667
Yes! And I spent, like,
half of it on a slice of pizza.

07:15.902 --> 07:17.392
They take so much out.

07:17.470 --> 07:19.734
That's why you need
the swag from the Closet.

07:19.806 --> 07:21.137
- Swag?
- The goodies.

07:21.207 --> 07:24.108
You gotta start thinking of it
as part of your wages. Look.

07:24.410 --> 07:29.404
Don't you just love it? Now that is the
"it" bag of the season. It's true art.

07:29.482 --> 07:33.111
Look at the way the buckles offset
the pattern. It just slays me.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.914
You know, my mom used
to have a bag just like this.

07:35.988 --> 07:40.482
She gave it to me when I was, like,
three. I used to carry my crayons in it.

07:41.727 --> 07:43.627
It made my sister furious.

07:44.230 --> 07:48.189
Hey, lovely ladies, 200 bucks.
You can't tell it from the real thing.

07:48.267 --> 07:51.998
<i>Yeah, he can't tell it from a Gucci.
You walk into Mode with a knockoff,</i>

07:52.071 --> 07:55.199
you might as well walk in
with a cow bladder. Everybody knows.

07:58.377 --> 08:00.504
He did all this damage in a month?

08:00.580 --> 08:04.016
Dad, he's an editor in chief.
He's gotta entertain people.

08:04.083 --> 08:05.778
- What's Bouley?
- Bouley.

08:05.852 --> 08:08.047
Only the hottest restaurant in TriBeCa.

08:08.120 --> 08:11.783
- He spent $821 on dinner?
- Next time we go to the chicken place,

08:11.858 --> 08:14.554
I'm ordering white meat,
I don't want to hear about it.

08:14.627 --> 08:18.563
This is business. He's entertaining
models, advertisers, designers...

08:18.631 --> 08:21.099
- What's that say on the back?
- It's a blank.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.499
Another miscellaneous expense.

08:23.569 --> 08:25.764
There's a lot of miscellaneous expenses.

08:25.838 --> 08:28.568
Fine. Wilhelmina's expenses
are miscellaneous.

08:28.641 --> 08:30.370
So she went to Rio.

08:30.443 --> 08:32.638
She's creative director.
It was a shoot.

08:32.712 --> 08:33.871
It was in the last issue.

08:33.946 --> 08:38.679
Twenty-five thousand dollars
to Casa Brazil for props and extras?

08:38.751 --> 08:42.881
- They haven't given you a paycheck?
- Actually, they gave it to me today.

08:42.955 --> 08:43.943
And?

08:49.428 --> 08:54.229
Someone is blowing 25 grand in Rio,
and this is what they're paying you?

08:54.300 --> 08:56.791
She's not doing it for money.
It's an opportunity.

08:56.869 --> 09:01.135
Well, maybe you should get another job
to support your opportunity.

09:01.207 --> 09:04.540
[Speaks Spanish]
They take so much out.

09:05.711 --> 09:08.043
Well, it's still a paycheck, Betty.

09:08.114 --> 09:10.014
It's more than I made on my first job.

09:11.450 --> 09:13.384
Come on, the novella's waiting.

09:14.287 --> 09:17.017
- [Sighs]
- Betty...

09:19.692 --> 09:22.092
We have to make some serious cutbacks.

09:22.728 --> 09:25.458
The pharmacy wouldn't fill
his prescription today.

09:25.531 --> 09:27.123
What?

09:27.199 --> 09:30.862
Maria Ortiz? She can't do that.
She knows he needs his pills to work.

09:32.672 --> 09:37.109
It wasn't Maria. It's his HMO.
They're not gonna cover him anymore.

10:07.540 --> 10:11.203
- Stop following me, Walter!
- I have something for you.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.768
I don't need any more batteries,
thank you.

10:13.846 --> 10:15.643
It's a universal remote.

10:15.715 --> 10:19.116
We only have one TV.
Now leave me alone.

10:25.358 --> 10:28.293
- Walter...
- I'm going to get you back, Betty.

10:28.394 --> 10:31.830
Not by stalking me.
You cheated on me, Walter!

10:31.897 --> 10:35.424
You cheated with Gina Gambarro.
Do you understand what that means?

10:35.501 --> 10:41.167
I don't care how many universal remotes
you give me. There's no winning me back.

10:46.112 --> 10:48.945
Your father's HMO file
is under investigation.

10:49.015 --> 10:50.539
- What kind?
- I don't know.

10:50.616 --> 10:53.278
They don't tell me.
All I know is they refuse to cover

10:53.653 --> 10:56.315
his prescription
until the matter is resolved.

10:56.522 --> 11:00.458
[Sighs] Maria,
my father needs his medication.

11:00.526 --> 11:05.190
Did I say he couldn't have his
medication? You pay me $197 and...

11:05.264 --> 11:07.994
- Walter!
- What? I'm shopping.

11:08.067 --> 11:10.126
No, you do not have a feminine itch.

11:12.605 --> 11:15.369
I don't have $197.

11:15.441 --> 11:18.899
<i>- What, don't they pay you at Mode?
- Not enough.</i>

11:19.612 --> 11:22.274
I'm supposed to give
your prescription gratis, huh?

11:22.348 --> 11:24.680
That's how my father and I
stay in business?

11:24.850 --> 11:26.579
Get out!

11:32.525 --> 11:35.722
Can you really blame him
for trying on Gina Gambarro?

11:49.308 --> 11:52.675
Betty! Miss Suarez!

11:55.181 --> 11:58.241
- Mr. Meade?
- I need to see you this morning.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.243
- Me?
- My office, 10:30 sharp.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.754
Yes, sir, 10:30 sharp.

12:03.823 --> 12:07.919
Betty, I don't want anyone to know.
Especially Daniel.

12:19.405 --> 12:23.307
- [Mumbling to self]
- You know, you could bow a lot.

12:23.809 --> 12:25.834
Your expense report.
You need to sign it.

12:25.911 --> 12:28.573
So Oshi lands at eight,
he's staying at the...

12:28.647 --> 12:31.741
The Asia on Park, in the penthouse.
I've ordered the flowers.

12:31.817 --> 12:34.217
- White Dendrobium orchids?
- Red roses.

12:34.286 --> 12:36.686
He hates color. Veuve Laurent Brut?

12:38.991 --> 12:42.119
It's champagne.
Five bottles, at least.

12:42.194 --> 12:45.288
- He brushes his teeth with it.
- I appreciate your help,

12:45.364 --> 12:48.663
but this is my dinner, my meeting,
my chance to get to know Oshi.

12:50.236 --> 12:51.464
You're not invited.

12:52.538 --> 12:54.768
Did Marc help you
with the expense report?

12:55.374 --> 12:57.399
Yes, thank you.

12:59.044 --> 13:03.071
No thanks needed. Just make sure
Oshi's limo is a white stretch.

13:03.916 --> 13:07.408
Oh, and Betty, make sure
to get that down to Accounting by...

13:07.486 --> 13:09.818
- 10:30.
- Can you pick me up coffee and a bagel?

13:09.889 --> 13:11.117
- White...
- Two sugars,

13:11.190 --> 13:13.249
water bagel with cream cheese? Got it.

13:13.325 --> 13:15.452
I need you to front me the cash.
I'm out.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.086
Oh, um...

13:17.163 --> 13:18.494
Yeah, OK.

13:20.699 --> 13:23.065
[Phone ringing]

13:24.804 --> 13:26.169
Daniel Meade's office.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.269
Daniel, it's that woman again.

13:35.481 --> 13:36.948
This is Daniel Meade.

13:37.082 --> 13:39.710
[Woman] Your father is destroying
evidence, Daniel.

13:39.785 --> 13:42.549
[Tsking] He is covering his tracks.

13:42.621 --> 13:44.612
Who is this?
Who are you?

13:44.690 --> 13:48.251
A friend interested in justice.

13:48.327 --> 13:51.319
Ooh. Do you hear that, Daniel?

13:51.397 --> 13:54.423
[Grinding]

13:54.500 --> 13:57.628
- That was her car.
- Who's car?

13:57.703 --> 13:59.500
<i>Oh, not telling.</i>

13:59.572 --> 14:02.336
- Who is this?
- You'll figure it out.

14:02.408 --> 14:04.137
Don't ever call here again.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.341
[Chuckling]

14:13.352 --> 14:16.344
[Music box playing]

14:19.291 --> 14:21.282
[Music stops]

14:24.964 --> 14:26.989
[Women squealing]

14:27.066 --> 14:29.899
Back off, Shaquille!
These are women's boots!

14:29.969 --> 14:33.200
I'm number seven on the sheet, honey.
Better luck next time.

14:33.272 --> 14:35.172
[Amanda] Christina!

14:35.241 --> 14:37.675
Gucci bag in the August issue.
I know you have it.

14:37.776 --> 14:41.177
- Must be in the accessory closet, love.
- I looked, love.

14:41.247 --> 14:43.681
- It must be on the floor, love.
- It's not, love!

14:43.749 --> 14:46.718
- Pick something else, love! [groans]
- [Phone rings]

14:46.785 --> 14:50.585
- Oh! This is my hell.
- It's Betty. Is Amanda there?

14:50.656 --> 14:53.784
Oh, yeah. She's got the blonde
from Styles in a headlock.

14:53.859 --> 14:55.121
Why aren't you here?

14:55.194 --> 14:58.254
I have things to do and I need
Amanda to cover Daniel's phone.

14:58.330 --> 15:00.491
If I see anyone leaving
with that Gucci bag,

15:00.566 --> 15:02.591
I will club them with this boot.

15:02.668 --> 15:04.659
I'm serious,
it's a feeding frenzy.

15:04.737 --> 15:08.138
If you want anything at all
from the Closet, get down here now!

15:08.207 --> 15:12.337
OK, maybe later. Just please get Amanda
up here, Christina. I have to go. Bye.

15:16.482 --> 15:17.972
- Henry?
- [Henry] Yes.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.919
Betty Suarez. Daniel Meade's office.

15:23.989 --> 15:26.685
You're kidding.
You work on the 28th floor?

15:26.759 --> 15:27.885
That came out wrong.

15:28.460 --> 15:32.294
You just... you look normal.
Like from down here.

15:32.364 --> 15:34.628
Thank you. Here.

15:35.501 --> 15:39.562
Oh, well,
you certainly like to cut it close.

15:39.638 --> 15:40.764
I didn't get the memo.

15:40.839 --> 15:43.330
- You were on the list.
- I didn't get it. My boss did,

15:43.409 --> 15:45.240
last night. So here it is. Um...

15:46.912 --> 15:48.607
Take coffee with cream and sugar?

15:48.681 --> 15:50.342
- Yeah.
- Any cream cheese?

15:50.416 --> 15:51.508
Excuse me?

15:52.551 --> 15:54.712
- What?
- I'm sorry! I'll make it up to you.

15:56.722 --> 15:58.952
Hi, Mr. Meade, I'm sorry I'm late.

15:59.024 --> 16:01.288
Elevator was full,
I waited for the second...

16:01.360 --> 16:04.193
I hope those are for me.
I skipped breakfast.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.459
Yeah. Sure.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.600
- Here you go.
- [Sighs heavily]

16:12.671 --> 16:14.935
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
- Please.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.432
- OK.
- No cream cheese?

16:17.576 --> 16:18.941
No, they were out.

16:19.845 --> 16:22.814
So do you have any idea
why you're here?

16:24.583 --> 16:28.815
Sir, it was just one pack of Post-its.
I swear, I will bring it back.

16:28.887 --> 16:30.514
I love my job.

16:32.725 --> 16:35.626
There's this strange woman
who's been calling Daniel.

16:36.328 --> 16:39.559
- I assume you monitor his calls.
- Yes, sir.

16:39.631 --> 16:41.292
We fired her a couple of years ago.

16:41.367 --> 16:44.029
She threatens to sue.
Obviously, out of her mind.

16:44.103 --> 16:46.663
- Has she called again?
- Um, today.

16:46.739 --> 16:50.766
Uh, said something about you
destroying evidence.

16:51.410 --> 16:54.208
- Really?
- Daniel just hung up on her.

16:54.346 --> 16:58.806
Good. That's good.
Still, it's a nuisance.

16:58.884 --> 17:02.183
I need to know when she calls, Betty,
what she says to Daniel.

17:02.654 --> 17:04.383
You think you can do that for me?

17:06.125 --> 17:10.185
It's for legal reasons,
to protect Daniel and the company.

17:10.929 --> 17:12.362
Yes, sir.

17:13.799 --> 17:16.494
And he doesn't need
to know we're doing this.

17:16.835 --> 17:17.961
Our secret, huh?

17:19.605 --> 17:23.803
- Remember who signs your paycheck.
- Hmm. Yes, sir.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.709
But might I just say
you take out a lot.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.548
You can go now.

17:33.352 --> 17:37.789
Hey, Betty, Daniel's been
calling around for you. He isn't happy.

17:41.860 --> 17:45.728
- You wanna tell me where you've been?
- I was trying to get you a bagel...

17:46.632 --> 17:51.501
- Did you find some cream cheese?
- Oh, gee. Look, I'm sorry.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.971
I was in such a rush and my boss
wanted a bagel and some coffee,

17:55.040 --> 17:57.008
I was gonna make it up to you. Really...

17:57.076 --> 17:59.567
This is not about coffee
and a bagel, Betty.

17:59.645 --> 18:01.579
- Really?
- [Henry] I wish.

18:01.647 --> 18:03.911
It's about the expense report
you turned in.

18:03.982 --> 18:08.112
Henry here has rejected $20,000
of miscellaneous expenses,

18:08.187 --> 18:11.452
every dime of which I am personally
responsible. You wanna...

18:11.523 --> 18:12.785
What were you thinking?

18:20.132 --> 18:22.965
Miscellaneous expense?
Miscellaneous expense?

18:23.035 --> 18:25.731
You need to put names, dates,
reasons for the meal.

18:25.804 --> 18:28.602
Yeah, but, I just...
I copied Wilhelmina's report.

18:28.674 --> 18:32.041
Ms. Slater's expense reports
are always meticulously detailed.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.237
Of course they are.

18:33.312 --> 18:36.804
Wilhelmina knows exactly
how this makes me look to my father.

18:36.882 --> 18:40.443
- Does he get copies?
- Whenever there's a large violation,

18:40.519 --> 18:44.250
the server sends it and suspends
the credit card of the violator.

18:44.323 --> 18:47.815
Seriously? My card's suspended?

18:47.893 --> 18:49.918
It only takes a week to reactivate.

18:50.062 --> 18:54.089
A week? No,
I have a huge dinner tomorrow night.

18:54.166 --> 18:56.930
[Phone ringing]

18:57.002 --> 18:59.163
Betty... phone?

19:03.442 --> 19:06.878
Daniel Meade's office. Yes, sir.

19:08.514 --> 19:10.209
Yeah, I'll tell him.

19:14.186 --> 19:15.949
That's your father.

19:17.456 --> 19:20.687
Twenty thousand dollars
of miscellaneous expenses?

19:21.693 --> 19:26.027
Yesterday, I defended your fiscal
responsibility to Wilhelmina Slater.

19:26.632 --> 19:29.533
She's gunning for publisher.
You know that?

19:30.602 --> 19:34.368
She thinks you need financial
supervision. Is she right?

19:34.439 --> 19:37.203
No, sir. Not from her.

19:37.276 --> 19:38.971
I'm not so sure.

19:39.845 --> 19:42.040
I think you've gone soft on my money.

19:42.114 --> 19:44.708
I think you've got something
to prove to me.

19:45.384 --> 19:46.976
So here's what I'm gonna do.

19:47.052 --> 19:50.317
I'm gonna eat the 20 grand,
call it an accounting error.

19:50.556 --> 19:51.614
Thank you.

19:51.690 --> 19:54.420
But this month,
you're gonna use your own money.

19:54.493 --> 19:58.122
Let's see how responsible you are
when it's coming out of your pocket.

20:01.567 --> 20:06.903
You only have $327 left
in your account? But you're a Meade.

20:06.972 --> 20:08.337
A poor Meade.

20:08.407 --> 20:11.774
I blew through my trust fund
like I was Michael Jackson.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.744
- I need this job, Betty.
- Well, you just got paid.

20:14.813 --> 20:17.304
It barely covered the rent on my loft.

20:17.382 --> 20:22.217
I've been living off
the company credit card, OK? I'm broke.

20:22.287 --> 20:24.778
You have to entertain
Oshi tomorrow night.

20:24.856 --> 20:27.222
Maybe you should just tell your father.

20:28.360 --> 20:32.023
And look fiscally irresponsible?
If I tell Dad that's all I have left,

20:32.097 --> 20:35.533
he'll make Wilhelmina publisher so fast
it'll make your head spin.

20:35.601 --> 20:40.629
And that'd be like handing the magazine
over to her. No. This is our secret.

20:40.706 --> 20:43.266
OK, yeah, yeah,
we can work our way out of this.

20:43.342 --> 20:45.674
My Dad always says,
"It's not how much you have,

20:45.744 --> 20:48.975
it's how you spend it."
We'll think of something.

20:50.849 --> 20:54.410
I don't know how that phony
expense report got into my files.

20:54.486 --> 20:58.513
I'm furious at you, Marc.
See that it never happens again.

20:59.758 --> 21:02.727
The witch and her
flying monkey set you up.

21:02.794 --> 21:04.193
Yeah, I get that now.

21:04.263 --> 21:09.462
Publisher. That would make her more
powerful than Daniel. Oh, God forbid.

21:09.534 --> 21:12.799
Right, well, there's not much left,

21:12.871 --> 21:15.772
but I did manage
to save one or two goodies.

21:16.775 --> 21:21.644
And you don't need
to be a size six to carry a nice bag.

21:21.713 --> 21:24.546
It's the Gucci bag.

21:24.616 --> 21:27.380
Wow, that's beautiful.
It matches your dress.

21:27.452 --> 21:30.819
It's not for me, Betty. It's for you.

21:31.290 --> 21:34.453
- No, no, no, no, I can't...
- No, no, it's your first swag,

21:34.526 --> 21:38.587
so you get first pick. Believe me,
you really do need a new purse. Go on.

21:43.735 --> 21:48.672
I believe fashion is good for the soul.
For just how it makes you feel.

21:51.143 --> 21:54.601
You'll be amazed at the respect
a designer label brings you here.

21:58.984 --> 22:03.284
Well, it's the nicest thing
I've ever owned. Thank you.

22:03.355 --> 22:05.789
Just don't put your crayons in it, OK?

22:10.495 --> 22:11.723
A watch?

22:11.797 --> 22:13.992
Christina said it's not that expensive,

22:14.066 --> 22:16.762
but they did use it
in a James Bond photo shoot.

22:17.369 --> 22:19.963
Suarez. Ignacio Suarez.

22:21.073 --> 22:23.735
- Hilda.
- What is it, what is it?

22:24.710 --> 22:28.840
It's a scarf! Oh, it's beautiful.

22:28.914 --> 22:31.815
- It's Hermes.
- Yeah, I know that.

22:32.417 --> 22:33.816
And Justin.

22:33.885 --> 22:37.218
Oh, my God, it's a Burberry belt.

22:38.590 --> 22:41.991
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
I've gotta call all my friends!

22:42.094 --> 22:44.790
No. No, you don't! Justin!

22:47.833 --> 22:51.428
That reminds me of your mother's
handbag, the one she gave to you.

22:51.503 --> 22:54.063
Remember?
You used to carry it everywhere.

22:54.139 --> 22:57.506
- It was almost as big as you were.
- I remember.

22:57.876 --> 23:00.936
Man, how she loved that bag.

23:02.547 --> 23:06.881
She said it made her
feel beautiful. Hmm.

23:06.952 --> 23:12.049
Oh, Dad, I went to the pharmacy
this morning, and Maria wouldn't do it.

23:12.224 --> 23:15.921
- How much was the prescription?
- Almost two hundred.

23:17.662 --> 23:21.758
Well, that is a beautiful bag.

23:22.100 --> 23:26.867
And this... This is a wonderful watch.

24:00.772 --> 24:03.707
- Nice bag.
- Thank you.

24:03.775 --> 24:05.106
- Can I touch it?
- Yeah.

24:10.515 --> 24:14.042
My bag. She's got my bag.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.609
Yeah, I found it.

24:16.121 --> 24:19.716
- You were hiding it for her.
- Oh, don't be a spoilsport.

24:19.791 --> 24:22.760
- She doesn't deserve a Gucci bag.
- And you do, Marc?

24:22.828 --> 24:26.787
She won't know what to do with it.
Look! It's touching polyester!

24:26.865 --> 24:29.732
I think she's wearing it
rather nicely, actually.

24:32.237 --> 24:33.226
Whoops.

24:33.305 --> 24:37.435
I'm trying to apply for a new platinum
card. There seems to be a problem.

24:37.509 --> 24:41.843
<i>Daniel Meade. Yes, that's right,
Mode magazine. Mmm-hmm.</i>

24:43.482 --> 24:46.781
I see. Well, how
about a gold card, then?

24:47.752 --> 24:49.242
Silver?

24:50.255 --> 24:53.747
Come on, I'm running out
of colors here. Can you help me out?

24:53.825 --> 24:56.259
You know, that's entirely uncalled...

24:56.328 --> 25:01.027
Apparently, my credit rating's lower
than that of most convicted felons.

25:01.566 --> 25:03.659
Nice bag. Vuitton?

25:03.735 --> 25:05.635
Gucci. From the Closet.

25:05.704 --> 25:10.141
And inside, my list of 300
very fun things to do in New York City

25:10.208 --> 25:13.143
for under $300,
and I think it's very good.

25:13.345 --> 25:16.178
He's here! He's here! He's here!

25:16.381 --> 25:17.871
Oshi's on his way up!

25:19.184 --> 25:20.208
He's here.

25:37.903 --> 25:39.666

25:39.738 --> 25:44.072
Good morning.
I'm very thirsty. Are you?

25:48.947 --> 25:52.405
- We have fresh coffee.
- [Music clicks off]

25:53.818 --> 25:57.185
I am very thirsty
for some champagne, Oshi. Are you?

25:57.255 --> 26:00.713
- Wilhelmina!
- Ah! [smooching]

26:01.660 --> 26:02.718
Champagne.

[All speaking Japanese]

26:08.733 --> 26:10.963
Daniel Meade. [Speaks Japanese]

26:11.036 --> 26:15.336
I will be fitting my spring collection
on my models today and tomorrow.

26:15.407 --> 26:19.434
Tomorrow evening I will return to do
a showing for you and your editors.

26:20.679 --> 26:23.876
We will use your tube entry
for our runway walk.

26:25.450 --> 26:26.781
I like it.

26:26.985 --> 26:30.648
Round, white, minimal.

26:32.257 --> 26:34.316
Then we will drink champagne

26:34.392 --> 26:37.384
and you will take us out
for a wonderful meal.

26:38.163 --> 26:42.964
After that,
we will talk business... or not.

26:43.034 --> 26:44.695
[Music resumes playing]

26:50.108 --> 26:53.407
He said "a wonderful meal."
He's expecting a wonderful meal?

26:54.379 --> 26:57.712
Well, I'd be happy
to pick up the tab, Daniel.

26:57.782 --> 27:02.810
I can treat. Of course, then
you'd have to invite me to the dinner.

27:10.662 --> 27:15.326
She knows I'm broke.
She knew before she met with my father.

27:15.400 --> 27:18.733
I don't think it's a good idea
to let Wilhelmina pay for dinner.

27:18.803 --> 27:22.739
The Japanese are very attuned to nuance.
It would appear you're not in charge.

27:22.807 --> 27:27.335
Right, I get it. OK?
But I don't have a choice, right?

27:27.412 --> 27:29.437
If I use Wilhelmina's expense account,

27:29.514 --> 27:32.574
she gets credit for keeping Oshi,
my father knows I'm broke.

27:32.651 --> 27:36.917
But if I don't use her, we risk losing
Oshi and he really knows I'm broke.

27:36.988 --> 27:40.947
Either way, I end up looking incompetent
and she gets the publisher's job.

27:41.026 --> 27:44.325
Well, not if you can
impress Oshi under $300.

27:44.396 --> 27:46.489
There are some
great things on this list.

27:46.564 --> 27:49.124
Three hundred dollars
won't buy Oshi a scrunchie.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.327
We could take him to the movie.

27:51.403 --> 27:54.304
Or... OK, the Statue of Liberty.

27:54.939 --> 27:57.169
Or you know what?
Walter and I had so much fun

27:57.242 --> 28:01.042
eating at Papaya Queen and riding
the Staten Island Ferry. Really.

28:01.713 --> 28:05.945
- The ferry, Betty? Really?
- Yeah.

28:07.485 --> 28:09.851
Yeah, well, let's forget it.

28:09.921 --> 28:14.017
Wilhelmina's got us.
This is over. We're done.

28:15.260 --> 28:17.820
Well, it's his own fault
for spending so much.

28:17.929 --> 28:20.193
Yeah, but I filled out
his expense report.

28:20.265 --> 28:23.291
No, no, no. You just didn't lie for him.
They're all at it.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.802
They all cheat. Wilhelmina especially.

28:25.870 --> 28:28.395
They abuse accounts
like it's a God-given right,

28:28.473 --> 28:31.465
- and they pay us slave wages.
- Nice Gucci.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.033
Thank you.

28:34.345 --> 28:38.145
- Oh, it's the last salad.
- That's OK.

28:39.350 --> 28:43.184

- We can't all live on laxatives.

28:46.925 --> 28:49.553
Hey, Betty. Seamstress.

28:49.627 --> 28:52.323
See, the girl from Styles
who got my Louboutin boots,

28:52.397 --> 28:54.763
she would die to have your bag.
Here's the deal.

28:54.833 --> 28:57.927
I'll trade you my tickets
to the opera for your bag.

28:58.002 --> 29:01.335
Then I trade your bag for my boots
and everyone winds up a winner.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.340
The opera? She lives in Queens.

29:03.408 --> 29:07.208
If she wants to hear fat Italians
screaming, she can open her window.

29:07.278 --> 29:10.338
- Betty loves her new bag. Don't you?
- Yes, I do.

29:10.415 --> 29:13.578
There you go then. Away
and throw up your celery sticks. Shoo!

29:14.252 --> 29:18.780
Opera tickets? Christina,
how much, exactly, is this bag worth?

29:18.857 --> 29:20.757
Retail? About 4,500.

29:20.825 --> 29:24.625
With the pickle, however, 42.

29:40.645 --> 29:44.274
Please just go home, Walter.
Leave me alone.

30:05.770 --> 30:07.761
- [Door closes]
- [Betty] I'm home.

30:07.872 --> 30:11.103
We didn't want to start without you,
but it was getting cold.

30:11.176 --> 30:14.668
I went to see Maria.
She gave you 15 refills.

30:14.846 --> 30:18.282
Fifteen? Are you gonna tell me how
you got her to give you 15 refills?

30:18.349 --> 30:20.078
Where's your Gucci?

30:26.524 --> 30:28.185
- Betty...
- It's OK.

30:28.259 --> 30:30.420
It was swag, part of my wages.

30:30.495 --> 30:33.987
That witch blows 25 grand in Rio
and you've gotta give up your purse?

30:34.065 --> 30:36.659
- It's OK.
- No, you know, it's not OK, Betty.

30:36.734 --> 30:38.292
Well, that's the way it is!

30:42.907 --> 30:44.204
I got it.

30:49.514 --> 30:51.505
[Knock on door]

30:52.717 --> 30:54.617
Hey.

30:56.387 --> 31:00.289
Do you remember how angry you were
when Mom gave me her good purse?

31:00.758 --> 31:03.386
Yeah, well, you were three,

31:04.495 --> 31:08.124
and you used it
to carry around your crayons.

31:08.533 --> 31:11.832
I finally figured out
why she gave it to me and not to you.

31:11.903 --> 31:13.632
[Speaks Spanish]

31:14.539 --> 31:17.030
She knew how it would make me feel.

31:20.945 --> 31:24.676
Christina says that fashion
is good for the soul.

31:25.750 --> 31:28.913
And when I was walking around
with my Gucci today,

31:30.221 --> 31:33.884
it was like I was three-years-old again
and holding Mom's purse.

31:35.927 --> 31:39.328
I actually felt pretty.

31:54.345 --> 31:55.869
Hello. Where's the Gucci?

31:55.947 --> 31:58.040
I didn't want
to get another pickle on it.

31:58.850 --> 32:01.819
I realize the opera tickets
were totally inappropriate.

32:01.886 --> 32:05.049
Here is a Menudo box set
and a coupon for a hundred taquitos.

32:06.057 --> 32:07.388
What?

32:11.996 --> 32:13.861
- I don't have time.
- That makes two.

32:13.932 --> 32:16.628
I need Wilhelmina's expense
from the last issue.

32:16.701 --> 32:18.931
- The real one.
- That's against policy.

32:19.003 --> 32:22.234
- Coffee and a bagel?
- Need a real reason.

32:22.307 --> 32:27.301
There was a $25,000 charge made to
the Casa Brazil under props and extras.

32:27.378 --> 32:30.313
- And?
- Show me the props and extras.

32:30.415 --> 32:33.851

Sand, water, boobs.

32:33.918 --> 32:35.852
This could've been shot for nothing.

32:35.954 --> 32:38.787
Maybe she was padding.
Everybody pads a little.

32:38.856 --> 32:43.850
A little? Daniel, $25,000?
That's my family's rent for a year.

32:43.928 --> 32:47.659
I can't question the creative director
of a major fashion magazine.

32:47.732 --> 32:51.600
Who's hiding a huge expense
under props and extras. It's not right.

32:51.703 --> 32:53.967
- It's not right when you do it.
- Point taken.

32:54.038 --> 32:56.905
But Oshi's due in two hours.
If we take Wilhelmina down...

32:56.975 --> 32:59.705
They cancel her credit card.
She can't pay for Oshi,

32:59.777 --> 33:02.007
and your father
won't make her publisher.

33:02.080 --> 33:06.608
And I'm left with $327 to entertain
Oshi and his entire entourage.

33:06.684 --> 33:09.050
Ditch the entourage.
Only take him to dinner.

33:09.120 --> 33:12.283
And don't tell me
that $327 isn't enough.

33:12.357 --> 33:17.795
OK. All right, and how
do we prove Wilhelmina cheated? Hmm?

I don't think Masa allows dishwashing
as a form of payment.

33:56.934 --> 34:00.995
Actually, Wilhelmina, I was thinking
of something a bit more private.

34:01.072 --> 34:02.300
Were you?

34:02.373 --> 34:07.709
Oshi-san. In the spirit of minimalism
and to honor your collection,

34:07.779 --> 34:11.647
uh, I was thinking we might have our
dinner one-on-one. You and me.

- Where's Henry?

- With your father.
- Is there any way to hold them off?

34:56.828 --> 35:00.127
- Why?
- Because "Oshi is Oshi."

35:00.198 --> 35:02.666
We have $300 to feed 15 people.

35:02.733 --> 35:06.169

No! Then you lose, Daniel.
You can't just give up without a fight.

We don't have a plan B, Betty.
I don't have a choice.

Oshi's ready for more champagne.

at Masa, Oshi.
