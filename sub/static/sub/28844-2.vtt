[chatter over PA]

00:16.274 --> 00:17.482
- Funny.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.793
I don't remember
authorizing your release.

00:19.862 --> 00:23.068
- That's because I didn't ask.

00:23.137 --> 00:25.034
- You know, just because you
feel like ready to leave

00:25.103 --> 00:27.000
doesn't mean you are.

00:27.068 --> 00:29.586
- That's exactly what it means.

00:29.655 --> 00:32.448
- You know, I can
have you restrained.

00:32.517 --> 00:34.379
Just let me
look at the sutures.

00:36.517 --> 00:39.068
Come on.
- [sighs]

00:39.137 --> 00:40.827
- Have a seat.

00:40.896 --> 00:43.448
You can put that on the bed.

00:43.517 --> 00:46.517
- No, I can't

00:58.379 --> 01:02.448
I did my best to
straighten the incision...

01:02.517 --> 01:06.448
Looks like your vet
used a bread knife.

01:06.517 --> 01:08.482
Well, it's healing ...

01:08.551 --> 01:10.344
Those should come out
in a few days

01:10.413 --> 01:12.034
and then you'll be free

01:12.103 --> 01:14.724
to terrify small children
at the rec center's pool.

01:14.793 --> 01:15.931
- Yeah. [laughs]- Not a joke.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.758
I want you swimming
twice a week.

01:17.827 --> 01:19.758
With an instructor--

01:19.827 --> 01:21.275
- I know how to swim.

01:21.344 --> 01:23.379
- You don't know how
to swim to rehab this.

01:23.448 --> 01:27.241
My office will put you in touch
with a physical therapist.

01:27.310 --> 01:31.103
You're in this situation because
you ignored your doctor.

01:31.172 --> 01:33.551
He saw a mass on your CT scan,

01:33.620 --> 01:36.655
he said schedule an appointment,
and you didn't.

01:36.724 --> 01:38.379
And so now you've
had major surgery

01:38.448 --> 01:40.586
for what a pill
could've fixed.

01:40.655 --> 01:43.000
When's the last time
you saw a dermatologist--

01:43.068 --> 01:45.793
- Oh, for fuck's sake, Keith.

01:58.862 --> 02:00.448
Thank you.

02:21.413 --> 02:23.655
[groans]

02:23.724 --> 02:25.517
- You alright?

02:25.586 --> 02:28.724
- Yeah. Just hurts to sit.

02:33.103 --> 02:35.241
- Sorry.

02:35.310 --> 02:38.655
Didn't see that one.

02:38.724 --> 02:40.275
- Jesus, son.

02:40.344 --> 02:41.448
Are you aiming for them??

02:41.517 --> 02:42.551
- If you know
a smoother way back,

02:42.620 --> 02:44.758
you let me know
and I'll take it!

02:44.827 --> 02:48.137
- Just, pull over right here.

03:23.655 --> 03:25.482
- Maybe it's a little
soon to come home.

03:25.551 --> 03:28.827
- Yeah, well, I could
say the same to you.

03:28.896 --> 03:30.241
- What's that mean?

03:30.310 --> 03:32.068
- It means,
you don't fight, Kayce.

03:32.137 --> 03:33.620
Understand me?

03:33.689 --> 03:35.586
If wranglers get worked over,
then wranglers handle it.

03:35.655 --> 03:37.137
- How am I supposed
to sleep in the same room

03:37.206 --> 03:38.275
with men I won't defend?

03:38.344 --> 03:39.413
- You aren't.

03:39.482 --> 03:42.241
I'm gonna fix
that problem, too.

03:44.172 --> 03:47.172
- What, you walking home now?

03:47.241 --> 03:49.448
I don't even know
whose field this is.

03:49.517 --> 03:52.827
- Me neither.

03:52.896 --> 03:54.758
Ten years ago I did.

03:58.827 --> 04:03.000
I think I finally
understand you, son.

04:03.068 --> 04:04.896
- Yeah, well if you wanna
to explain me to me,

04:04.965 --> 04:08.862
I'm all ears.

04:08.931 --> 04:10.620
- You know, there's
being scared to die, son,

04:10.689 --> 04:14.827
and knowing it's coming.

04:14.896 --> 04:16.137
When you know it's coming,

04:16.206 --> 04:19.447
Tomorrow stops factoring
into your decisions,

04:19.517 --> 04:21.586
because you know you're
never gonna see it.

04:24.482 --> 04:27.448
Then you...

04:27.517 --> 04:29.793
Then you live.

04:29.862 --> 04:32.310
And you realize you ain't dead,
and you're not gonna die.

04:32.379 --> 04:35.862
And now you gotta face
all of them decisions you made.

04:37.689 --> 04:40.827
And out of all that,
you gotta figure out

04:40.896 --> 04:44.241
how to let yourself
living again.

04:48.965 --> 04:50.482
- I don't know how to do that.

04:52.379 --> 04:53.620
- Yeah.

04:57.241 --> 05:00.655
Shit, I don't know.

05:00.724 --> 05:04.172
I don't know.

05:04.241 --> 05:06.275
But we'll figure it out.

05:14.965 --> 05:18.137
[theme music]

06:17.103 --> 06:18.551
- This is how many acres?

06:18.620 --> 06:19.724
- 324.

06:19.793 --> 06:22.379
Listing price is 4.9.

06:22.448 --> 06:24.517
- How motivated
are the sellers?

06:24.586 --> 06:28.000
- Well, they tried
to spend the winter here.

06:28.068 --> 06:30.034
- All right. Offer 3.5.
No escrow. Cash.

06:30.103 --> 06:32.379
Seven day close.
Don't you want to see it first?

06:32.448 --> 06:33.689
I'm seeing it now.

06:33.758 --> 06:35.896
- Okay...

06:35.965 --> 06:39.000
I'll head to the office
and write up the offer--

06:40.275 --> 06:43.793
Actually, let me
show you one more.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.758
- Now, this one isn't
on the market-

06:45.827 --> 06:47.137
But I know the property well,
and I think--

06:47.206 --> 06:48.862
- Then why are you
showing it to me?

06:48.931 --> 06:50.827
- You said every large
property in the county--

06:50.896 --> 06:53.655
- For sale.

06:53.724 --> 06:55.034
- It's called the Pelican Ranch

06:55.103 --> 06:56.482
- Why is it called
the Pelican Ranch?

06:56.551 --> 06:58.586
- Maybe they saw a goose
and thought it was a pelican,

06:58.655 --> 07:01.586
who the fuck knows.
It's 1,100 acres-

07:01.655 --> 07:03.586
- What's with the wit?

07:03.655 --> 07:05.379
Doing some fast math
on your commission

07:05.448 --> 07:08.103
make you a little cocky?
Feeling good?

07:08.172 --> 07:10.000
Showing us properties
that aren't for sale?

07:10.068 --> 07:11.551
Boy, you're on a tear.

07:11.620 --> 07:14.275
You might even go home and lay
some pipe to the old lady.

07:14.344 --> 07:17.344
Look at you, with your your
capped teeth and spray tan.

07:17.413 --> 07:18.413
Get out of my office.

07:18.482 --> 07:20.103
- I don't...
What--

07:20.172 --> 07:21.482
- Get the fuck out of my office.

07:21.551 --> 07:22.827
Go write up the offer.

07:22.896 --> 07:24.310
When it's done, email it,

07:24.379 --> 07:27.344
so I don't have
to look at you again.

07:27.413 --> 07:29.034
And when you get
your commission,

07:29.103 --> 07:30.586
I want you to shove it
up your waxed ass,

07:30.655 --> 07:32.344
you cheesy motherfucker.

07:32.413 --> 07:34.586
Fuck, I hate real estate agents.

07:34.655 --> 07:37.344
Got your checkbook handy, Bobby?

07:37.413 --> 07:38.758
Let's take this party
on the road.

07:46.655 --> 07:48.896
- You the teacher's aide?

07:48.965 --> 07:51.655
- No, I'm the teacher.

07:51.724 --> 07:53.413
- I saw this
video on Pornhub

07:53.482 --> 07:55.068
and this is exactly
how it starts.

07:55.137 --> 07:57.275
[laughter]

07:57.344 --> 07:59.379
- Misogyny.
How refreshing.

07:59.448 --> 08:00.379
If you can work
in a Pocahontas joke

08:00.448 --> 08:02.310
you'll hit the trifecta.

08:02.379 --> 08:04.724
- Now that you mention it...
- What's your name?

08:04.793 --> 08:06.551
- Trent.

08:06.620 --> 08:09.068
- Can you tell me
the definition of power, Trent?

08:09.137 --> 08:11.275
Hmm?

08:11.344 --> 08:14.517
It's the ability
to direct or influence

08:14.586 --> 08:17.758
another's behavior
or a course of events.

08:17.827 --> 08:19.758
That's what I have--

08:19.827 --> 08:22.586
I can remove you from
this class and fail you.

08:22.655 --> 08:25.034
I can send you before
the dean for violating

08:25.103 --> 08:27.241
the student code of conduct.

08:27.310 --> 08:30.586
These are all things that can
alter the course of your life.

08:30.655 --> 08:34.275
That's power.
And you don't have any.

08:34.344 --> 08:36.413
[class chuckles]

08:39.136 --> 08:41.448
When Christopher Columbus
first came in contact

08:41.517 --> 08:43.102
with Native Americans,

08:43.172 --> 08:45.000
it was the Arawak
people in the Bahamas.

08:45.068 --> 08:47.931
I'll read to you
from Columbus's journal:

08:50.137 --> 08:54.551
"They willingly traded us
everything they owned...

08:54.620 --> 08:56.793
They do not bear arms,
and do not know them,

08:56.862 --> 08:59.241
for I showed them a sword,
they took it by the edge

08:59.310 --> 09:02.482
and cut themselves
out of ignorance.

09:02.551 --> 09:05.517
They will make fine slaves ...

09:05.586 --> 09:08.103
With fifty men we could
subjugate them all

09:08.172 --> 09:10.379
and make them do
whatever we want."

09:14.586 --> 09:18.482
You ever feel like that, Trent?

09:18.551 --> 09:23.448
Ever feel like making
someone do you want,

09:23.517 --> 09:25.517
whether they want to or not?

09:32.551 --> 09:34.241
It's a very European mentality,

09:34.310 --> 09:36.448
stemming from
the oppressive political

09:36.517 --> 09:39.413
and religious structures
of the Renaissance.

09:39.482 --> 09:42.344
Kings and priests
with absolute power

09:42.413 --> 09:46.689
ruling masses who have none.

09:46.758 --> 09:49.965
That was the mentality of the
men who discovered America.

09:50.034 --> 09:54.172
And it is the mentality our
society struggles with today...

09:54.241 --> 09:57.137
What you know of history
is a dominant culture's

09:57.206 --> 09:58.965
justification for its actions.

09:59.034 --> 10:02.655
And I don't teach that.

10:02.724 --> 10:06.517
I'll teach you what happened.

10:06.586 --> 10:09.793
To my people.
And to yours.

10:11.241 --> 10:13.379
Because we are all the
descendants of the subjugated.

10:13.448 --> 10:16.896
Every one of us.

10:25.586 --> 10:28.344
You did well.

10:28.413 --> 10:29.862
Were you nervous?

10:29.931 --> 10:31.137
- Terrified.

10:31.206 --> 10:34.137
- [laughs]

10:34.206 --> 10:37.689
So, um, that's new?

10:37.758 --> 10:39.724
What happened?

10:39.793 --> 10:42.034
- I fell down.

10:42.103 --> 10:44.413
- Excuse me, Miss, um ...
- Long.

10:44.482 --> 10:47.206
- Miss Long.

10:47.275 --> 10:48.620
I'm sorry. I wasn't--

10:48.689 --> 10:50.448
I didn't mean to...
I was just...

10:50.517 --> 10:52.965
- I know what you were doing.

10:53.034 --> 10:55.448
- I'm sorry.

10:55.517 --> 10:57.103
- Insult me or anyone else
in my class

10:57.172 --> 10:59.068
and you're out.

10:59.137 --> 11:01.931
Apology accepted.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.379
- Thank you.

11:05.448 --> 11:08.758
- Day one and you're already
winning hearts and minds.

11:08.827 --> 11:11.275
- That mind is far from won.

11:11.344 --> 11:13.724
- But it's not lost either.

11:17.758 --> 11:20.793
This opportunity is
what you make of it, Monica.

11:20.862 --> 11:22.344
Now, in the classroom

11:22.413 --> 11:24.689
I have every faith
you're gonna make it count.

11:24.758 --> 11:27.620
But there are plenty
of other resources

11:27.689 --> 11:29.551
that are available to you,
as well.

11:29.620 --> 11:33.103
Physical therapy,
if that's something you need.

11:33.172 --> 11:35.034
- It is.

11:35.103 --> 11:37.206
- It's covered under
your insurance policy.

11:37.275 --> 11:39.724
Just call and make
the appointment.

11:39.793 --> 11:42.517
And you should look
into faculty housing.

11:42.586 --> 11:45.620
- There's housing?

11:45.689 --> 11:48.551
- You need to read over
your welcome packet.

11:48.620 --> 11:53.034
See, a university is like
its own little world.

11:53.103 --> 11:56.137
And this whole world
is open to you now.

11:56.206 --> 11:59.758
So, go enjoy it.

12:37.551 --> 12:39.068
- Can I help you?

12:39.137 --> 12:41.413
- Why do you call
it the Pelican Ranch?

12:41.482 --> 12:43.241
- We moved from San Francisco.

12:43.310 --> 12:45.482
Always worried
we'd miss the ocean.

12:45.551 --> 12:49.482
When our agent
brought us here,

12:49.551 --> 12:51.586
there was a pelican
sitting in the pond.

12:51.655 --> 12:54.275
Like the ocean
followed us here.

12:54.344 --> 12:57.551
Our agent said he'd never
seen a pelican here before.

12:57.620 --> 13:00.551
- Sandy hair,
great tan, white teeth?

13:00.620 --> 13:01.724
- You know Mike?

13:01.793 --> 13:04.034
- It wasn't a pelican.

13:04.103 --> 13:05.344
- Sure looked like one.

13:05.413 --> 13:07.655
- Did it fly away
when you drove up?

13:07.724 --> 13:08.965
- No, it sat
in the center of the pond

13:09.034 --> 13:10.068
the whole time we were here.

13:10.137 --> 13:11.413
- Haven't seen it since, though.

13:14.862 --> 13:16.655
That's because it was a decoy.

13:16.724 --> 13:18.620
A big strange bird
in the middle of the pond

13:18.689 --> 13:21.275
scares away other birds.

13:21.344 --> 13:25.103
Birds that like to eat
the trout in the pond.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.689
Got any trout in the pond?

13:26.758 --> 13:29.758
- Not like we used to.
- Mm-hmm.

13:33.172 --> 13:35.482
I'd like to buy your ranch.

13:35.551 --> 13:36.931
- Oh, it's not for sale.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
- Everything's for sale, buddy.
How much?

13:40.068 --> 13:44.034
- I mean ...
- Name your price.

13:44.103 --> 13:46.827
- Nine million?

14:01.724 --> 14:03.896
- Now, get out of my house.

14:08.241 --> 14:11.620
["Breakdown in G Major"
by Eliot Bronson plays]

14:16.689 --> 14:18.379
- Whoa, whoa.

14:26.310 --> 14:30.379
- This is what you call
low-man work. Jimmy.

14:30.448 --> 14:32.689
- What do you think you are?

14:32.758 --> 14:34.655
- Why isn't Cowboy out here?

14:34.724 --> 14:35.655
- He's a day-worker, Jimmy.

14:35.724 --> 14:37.862
His ass stays in the saddle.

14:37.931 --> 14:39.689
- I've worked years on ranches

14:39.758 --> 14:41.137
where my ass never
left the saddle neither.

14:41.206 --> 14:43.448
- Maybe you should've
stayed there, Walker.

14:43.517 --> 14:45.793
- Don't I know it.

14:47.206 --> 14:49.000
- What's that?

14:50.689 --> 14:51.689
I didn't hear you.

14:55.068 --> 14:57.068
Won't fight.
Won't work.

14:57.137 --> 14:59.379
But you'll sure eat our food
won't ya?

14:59.448 --> 15:01.103
and sit in our field,

15:01.172 --> 15:03.689
and sing like a fucking tourist.

15:03.758 --> 15:05.482
- Oh, it's your field,
is it, Rip?

15:07.724 --> 15:12.896
- These are set.

15:12.965 --> 15:16.241
- Jimmy, get on the quad.

15:25.724 --> 15:27.655
It's grinding, square it off.

15:40.344 --> 15:41.862
Keep it tight boys.

15:41.931 --> 15:44.482
Bulls will walk through a loose
wire like it ain't even there.

15:53.241 --> 15:55.379
Hey. The fuck you doing
standing there

15:55.448 --> 15:56.379
Start wrapping wire.

15:56.448 --> 15:59.482
- Hell I'm leaving tonight.

15:59.551 --> 16:00.482
You can spend
my week's wages at the bar

16:00.551 --> 16:03.724
for all I give a shit.

16:03.793 --> 16:06.344
- All these great ranches
you worked at, Walker,

16:06.413 --> 16:08.241
why not go back
to one of them?

16:08.310 --> 16:09.896
How'd you get in my truck?

16:09.965 --> 16:12.517
- Because I can't
leave the state.

16:12.586 --> 16:15.551
- There's plenty
of ranches in Montana.

16:15.620 --> 16:18.137
No, you're here because
they wouldn't have you.

16:18.206 --> 16:21.586
Why is that, Walker?

16:21.655 --> 16:23.931
When I start making phone calls,

16:24.000 --> 16:26.068
what am I gonna find
out about you?

16:26.137 --> 16:29.551
- Well I reckon I got a fondness
for the farmer's daughter.

16:29.620 --> 16:31.000
I guess we got that
in common, don't we?

16:40.172 --> 16:41.241
- Come on.

16:44.034 --> 16:45.310
- I'm gonna take
your fucking heart out

16:45.379 --> 16:46.724
through your throat, Walker.

16:46.793 --> 16:48.413
And shove that little fuckin'
knife up your ass.

16:49.655 --> 16:51.517
- If this goes down,
we gotta pick sides.

16:51.586 --> 16:53.137
- I'm on whatever
side you're on.

16:53.206 --> 16:55.000
- You won't die today, Walker.

16:55.068 --> 16:57.103
But you've taken your last step.

16:57.172 --> 17:00.758
Let's see what kinda cowboy
you are in a wheelchair.

17:00.827 --> 17:02.344
- Here you go.

17:04.172 --> 17:07.068
- I'm done with this place.

17:07.137 --> 17:08.517
Want to shoot me
in the back, old fart?

17:08.586 --> 17:10.586
Go for it.

17:15.103 --> 17:18.827
- Wherever you go, Walker,

17:18.896 --> 17:20.137
I'll find you.

17:26.310 --> 17:28.620
- The whole bunkhouse
is watching.

17:28.689 --> 17:30.275
- Why do you think
I did it, Lloyd.

17:35.379 --> 17:37.620
We got two miles
of fence to build.

17:37.689 --> 17:38.931
Let's go to work.

17:59.482 --> 18:01.379
- Fence work don't suit you?

18:02.931 --> 18:06.310
- Nothing about
this place suits me.

18:06.379 --> 18:07.827
- Where you headed?

18:07.896 --> 18:09.793
- You know the deal--

18:09.862 --> 18:13.103
gonna wander around
'til the next job finds me.

18:13.172 --> 18:15.758
- Walker,

18:15.827 --> 18:19.310
You run into trouble,
walk the other way.

18:20.862 --> 18:22.172
- Nice seeing you, cowboy.

18:43.482 --> 18:45.068
- Where you headed?

18:45.137 --> 18:47.482
- I quit.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.275
- How come?

18:51.344 --> 18:53.241
- I'm a cowboy.

18:53.310 --> 18:55.275
And that's all.

18:55.344 --> 18:56.551
- You know what I mean?
- No.

18:56.620 --> 18:58.275
- You know, that's
all we need from you.

18:58.344 --> 19:00.068
- That's not all you needed
the other night.

19:02.586 --> 19:04.310
- The other night
won't happen again.

19:04.379 --> 19:05.827
- You say that.

19:05.896 --> 19:08.793
Then someone else says
something different.

19:08.862 --> 19:11.034
Can't figure out
who runs this deal.

19:11.103 --> 19:13.103
- I run it.

19:13.172 --> 19:16.758
And he runs it.

19:16.827 --> 19:19.275
You don't listen
to nobody else.

19:19.344 --> 19:20.931
Head on back
to the bunkhouse.

19:27.931 --> 19:29.000
Head on back.

19:35.068 --> 19:38.034
Take me to the house.

19:38.103 --> 19:40.000
We're making some changes.

19:53.068 --> 19:56.482
- All right, just, ah...

19:56.551 --> 19:58.000
just sign these two
at the bottom,

19:58.068 --> 20:01.000
I'll have Beth
fill them out.

20:17.896 --> 20:20.344
Here.

20:23.206 --> 20:26.103
That was Lee's.

20:33.517 --> 20:35.482
- When do I start training?
- Soon.

20:35.551 --> 20:37.413
But let's...

20:37.482 --> 20:39.172
Let's get this bunkhouse
figured out first.

20:43.448 --> 20:45.034
You haven't mentioned her,
Kayce.

20:48.344 --> 20:50.000
Not once.

20:50.068 --> 20:52.137
Or Tate.

20:52.206 --> 20:53.620
Or why you're not with them.

20:53.689 --> 20:55.862
- What's talking
about it gonna do?

20:55.931 --> 20:58.551
- It'd help you form
a plan to get them back.

20:58.620 --> 21:00.517
- Plans are not change
the way someone feels.

21:02.103 --> 21:06.379
- When Lee ran this place, he--

21:06.448 --> 21:08.482
he was honest

21:08.551 --> 21:11.689
and he was fair.
With everyone.

21:11.758 --> 21:15.000
That's what I need from you.

21:15.068 --> 21:16.862
But you can't
be that way with others, son,

21:16.931 --> 21:20.689
until you're that way
with yourself.

21:26.620 --> 21:29.206
- I miss them.

21:29.275 --> 21:31.448
- What happened?

21:33.517 --> 21:36.413
- You happened, Dad.

21:36.482 --> 21:38.241
Then everything happened.

21:44.275 --> 21:47.379
- Kayce.

21:50.344 --> 21:51.931
Send Rip up to the house.

21:58.172 --> 22:00.448
- You enjoying
your fuckin' self?

22:00.517 --> 22:02.482
- Beautiful day.
Until now.

22:02.551 --> 22:04.310
- He in there?

22:04.379 --> 22:05.758
- He who?

22:11.275 --> 22:14.068
- Hey Rip.

22:14.137 --> 22:16.275
- Come here.

22:16.344 --> 22:18.793
- My father wants to see you.

22:18.862 --> 22:20.931
Hey, hey. Now.

22:40.620 --> 22:42.172
- You wanted to see me, sir?

22:43.758 --> 22:47.000
- Yeah, have a...
Have a seat.

22:54.758 --> 22:56.000
In a lot of ways,

22:56.068 --> 22:59.620
you're the only person
I can trust, Rip.

22:59.689 --> 23:01.034
Because you're the only person

23:01.103 --> 23:04.862
that doesn't benefit
when I'm gone.

23:04.931 --> 23:07.586
You do it for me.

23:07.655 --> 23:09.310
- Yes, sir.

23:09.379 --> 23:11.379
And I always will.

23:14.827 --> 23:15.931
- I hope so.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.862
'Cause what I'm asking next...

23:21.793 --> 23:22.862
it'll be the hardest.

23:26.206 --> 23:28.103
Kayce needs to learn
how to run this place.

23:31.724 --> 23:33.448
Needs to learn how
to lead these men.

23:33.517 --> 23:36.517
And he can't do that while
he's living with them.

23:39.620 --> 23:42.482
You understand
what I'm asking?

23:58.965 --> 24:02.551
- There's beer in the fridge.

24:02.620 --> 24:04.172
- I don't drink.

24:04.241 --> 24:05.482
- Figures.

24:15.655 --> 24:16.862
- That's not a penalty!

24:16.931 --> 24:18.344
- It is a penalty 'cuz he sucks.

24:18.413 --> 24:20.413
- You still want the bet?
- Yeah, I'll take 3 and 1.

24:20.482 --> 24:22.103
- Why do they both these teams
have the same fuckin' mascot?

24:22.172 --> 24:24.620
- Jimmy, you've literally lived
here for your entire life.

24:24.689 --> 24:26.137
- Be quiet. Be quiet.
- And don't know the difference?

24:26.206 --> 24:28.068
- So those are the Wildcats,
and those are the bobcats.

24:28.137 --> 24:29.103
- What's the fuckin' difference?

24:29.172 --> 24:30.517
- The difference is ...

24:30.586 --> 24:31.724
- Just stop, he doesn't know
what he's talking about.

24:31.793 --> 24:33.206
A bobcat is a specific breed.

24:33.275 --> 24:34.724
A wildcat is just a cat
that went wild. That's a run!

24:34.793 --> 24:37.344
- So they named their team
after a cat that just like,

24:37.413 --> 24:38.793
got out of the house?

24:38.862 --> 24:40.896
- It's not rocket science.
It's football.

24:40.965 --> 24:42.068
- Kid's got a point.

24:42.137 --> 24:43.517
- Y'all are ruining
this for me,

24:43.586 --> 24:45.137
shut the fuck up.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.275
[guitar playing]

25:25.241 --> 25:27.827
- Bobcats look good.

25:27.896 --> 25:30.172
- I got my money on 'em.

25:30.241 --> 25:31.896
- Okay, so just to clarify,

25:31.965 --> 25:33.586
Colby's mom,
that's a cougar?

25:33.655 --> 25:36.724
[laughter]

25:36.793 --> 25:38.000
- That'll be the last time

25:38.068 --> 25:39.172
you ever refer to
my mom as a cougar.

25:39.241 --> 25:40.551
- She prefers wildcat?

25:40.620 --> 25:42.275
[laughter]

25:42.344 --> 25:43.827
- Rawr.

25:52.344 --> 25:54.448
- And you thought
you got out of prison.

26:03.310 --> 26:05.862
- Nope.

26:05.931 --> 26:09.275
Hell, I just stumbled
into another one.

26:33.655 --> 26:35.862
[guitar playing continues]

26:40.068 --> 26:41.517
- Should we mount up?

26:41.586 --> 26:44.586
- Not up to me, Jimmy.

26:44.655 --> 26:46.862
- What's going on?

26:46.931 --> 26:49.620
- No clue.

26:55.758 --> 26:57.103
- The sooner you
push it to a head,

26:57.172 --> 27:02.862
the sooner it's behind you.

27:02.931 --> 27:06.379
- You know he's
not gonna follow me.

27:06.448 --> 27:08.241
Just you.

27:08.310 --> 27:10.931
- Ain't about his respect, son.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.931
It's about everyone else's.

27:39.931 --> 27:41.310
- We'll push 'em up
the valley

27:41.379 --> 27:43.344
then over the saddle
to East River Road.

27:43.413 --> 27:46.103
We'll take that
up the canyon.

27:46.172 --> 27:49.758
Ryan, you and Colby got point.

27:49.827 --> 27:52.482
Walker, Cowboy--
you're on swing.

27:52.551 --> 27:57.137
Avery and Jimmy
you got flank.

27:57.206 --> 28:01.206
Rip.

28:01.275 --> 28:04.103
You and Lloyd are riding drag.

28:04.172 --> 28:05.172
Let's go.

28:12.931 --> 28:14.896
- Hope you boys
got your wild rag.

28:14.965 --> 28:17.068
It's gonna be a bit dusty.

28:21.689 --> 28:23.482
- What the hell's going on?

28:23.551 --> 28:25.827
- Just a little reminder, Lloyd.

28:25.896 --> 28:28.448
They may let us stay here
and get old and rusted.

28:28.517 --> 28:29.793
But we're just tools.

28:29.862 --> 28:31.724

36:21.551 --> 36:23.413
What would you like
to talk about, Daddy?

36:23.482 --> 36:25.620
What should we share?

36:25.689 --> 36:27.793
He's been up
since 4 A.M. working.

36:27.862 --> 36:29.620
You go to bed night
thinking about work

36:29.689 --> 36:31.068
and wake up doing the same.

36:31.137 --> 36:32.620
We don't talk about work,

36:32.689 --> 36:33.862
we have nothing to talk about.

36:33.931 --> 36:35.413
Are you suggesting
we eat in silence?

36:35.482 --> 36:37.655
I mean, Is that what you want--

36:37.724 --> 36:39.000
Are you 'shushing' me, Daddy?

36:42.689 --> 36:45.931
I'm a 35-year-old woman.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.344
When I sit at a table,

36:47.413 --> 36:50.862
I will talk about whatever
the fuck I want.

36:59.827 --> 37:01.413
- I see nothing's changed.

37:01.482 --> 37:03.551
- I don't think she's made
it through a whole meal

37:03.620 --> 37:06.965
since she was eleven.

37:07.034 --> 37:08.724
- [chuckles]

37:15.689 --> 37:17.137
- Oh, uh...
[clears throat]

37:17.206 --> 37:19.448
You got physical
therapy tomorrow.

37:21.275 --> 37:22.551
- I know.

37:22.620 --> 37:24.068
- You ain't missing it either.

37:27.275 --> 37:29.241
- I won't.

38:09.551 --> 38:11.896
- Things are becoming
a little clearer to me.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.931
Quite the sacrifice.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.965
- Yeah, well,
it's what your father want.

38:25.758 --> 38:28.241
- I remember the first
time I saw you.

38:29.965 --> 38:31.965
So wild.

38:32.034 --> 38:33.655
So angry...

38:33.724 --> 38:37.000
God, you were beautiful.

38:39.034 --> 38:42.241
I remember the way
you looked at him.

38:42.310 --> 38:45.655
Such devotion.

38:45.724 --> 38:47.482
Made me so jealous.

38:47.551 --> 38:51.000
And the way he looked at you.

38:53.862 --> 38:57.413
I always worried that
he'd love you more someday.

39:01.206 --> 39:02.862
But he doesn't.

39:05.517 --> 39:08.482
- That was never in doubt.

39:11.586 --> 39:13.103
- Don't leave.

39:17.068 --> 39:19.586
- This is my family.

39:19.655 --> 39:22.103
Whether any of you all
think of me that way or not.

39:28.586 --> 39:31.827
- Where are you going?
- Home.

39:45.482 --> 39:48.931
- What's that?

39:49.000 --> 39:51.137
- It's for this.

39:57.034 --> 39:58.517
- We're moving?!

39:58.586 --> 40:01.551
- You like it?

40:01.620 --> 40:02.965
- Where are you moving?

40:03.034 --> 40:05.241
- Run to bed, buddy.
I'll come tuck you in in a bit.

40:07.379 --> 40:09.862
The university offers
housing for faculty.

40:11.275 --> 40:12.931
- What about Kayce?

40:13.000 --> 40:15.241
- This is closer to Kayce.

40:15.310 --> 40:17.068
- That's not what I mean.

40:17.137 --> 40:20.379
You gotta really think about
the decisions you make, honey.

40:20.448 --> 40:22.620
- I have thought about it.

40:22.689 --> 40:24.724
Feels right.

40:24.793 --> 40:27.137
For Tate.
And for me.

40:27.206 --> 40:28.931
- Remember this.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
You two were married
in ceremony.

40:32.068 --> 40:34.172
Not in some courthouse.

40:34.241 --> 40:37.034
Ceremony.

40:37.103 --> 40:40.068
That means you're married
to him in the afterlife

40:40.137 --> 40:42.379
no matter what
you do in this life.

40:42.448 --> 40:45.482
You two are stuck together.

40:45.551 --> 40:47.517
Want to decide something?

40:47.586 --> 40:50.931
Decide how you two
are gonna work it out.

40:51.000 --> 40:55.862
Or you'll be miserable...
forever.

41:33.793 --> 41:36.275
- So, you're
the big man now, huh?

41:36.344 --> 41:38.482
- Uh...

41:38.551 --> 41:40.689
Couldn't run the bunkhouse
while I was living in it.

41:42.689 --> 41:44.000
- So, go live in the main house.

41:44.068 --> 41:46.758
- Grown men don't live
with their fathers.

41:46.827 --> 41:48.310
- Yeah they also
don't kick other men

41:48.379 --> 41:50.482
out of the only home
they've ever had.

41:50.551 --> 41:54.344
- Well he could
use some little humility.

41:54.413 --> 41:55.689
He ain't nothing but a bully.

41:55.758 --> 41:57.793
And that's all he's ever been.

41:57.862 --> 42:00.172
- No. He's not a bully, Kayce.

42:03.413 --> 42:06.241
He's exactly what our father
turned him into.

42:10.551 --> 42:13.068
What do you think
he's turning you into?

42:18.620 --> 42:21.413
Boy, it sure was easy
for you to walk away

42:21.482 --> 42:25.000
from a life that
you worked so hard to build.

42:25.068 --> 42:26.896
- Well, she doesn't want
that life anymore.

42:29.517 --> 42:31.793
- Let me guess.

42:31.862 --> 42:34.172
She left you because...

42:34.241 --> 42:37.241
she was afraid that
you would turn into him.

42:37.310 --> 42:39.206
Instead of proving her wrong,
you come here,

42:39.275 --> 42:42.241
and you take the crash course
in how to do it.

42:42.310 --> 42:45.758
- This place is all
I have to give them.

42:45.827 --> 42:47.344
I'm just trying to protect it.

42:47.413 --> 42:50.793
- I'm protecting it.
I'm protecting it.

42:50.862 --> 42:52.551
You're really going
to sit on boards

42:52.620 --> 42:54.413
and run for office
and navigate

42:54.482 --> 42:56.793
the filthy fights a place
like this requires?!

42:56.862 --> 42:59.000
No you're not.

42:59.068 --> 43:00.827
Kayce, you're gonna
lose your temper

43:00.896 --> 43:02.482
and put somebody
in the hospital

43:02.551 --> 43:04.413
or worse and go to prison

43:04.482 --> 43:07.137
and get sued
and lose this place...

43:07.206 --> 43:09.724
Just go home, Kayce.

43:09.793 --> 43:11.206
Go work on this--

43:15.275 --> 43:19.689
And you stay
far away from him.

43:19.758 --> 43:22.068
When he dies,

43:22.137 --> 43:25.137
you can have
this fucking place.

43:25.206 --> 43:27.137
I will give it to you.

43:56.724 --> 43:58.000
- All right.

43:58.068 --> 43:59.965
Meet me out front
in half an hour.

44:00.034 --> 44:02.965
- I'll meet you inside.

44:03.034 --> 44:04.551
- Out front in half an hour.

44:04.620 --> 44:06.034
- Oh, no.

44:06.103 --> 44:09.310
I wouldn't miss this
for the world.

44:09.379 --> 44:10.827
- Great.

44:17.068 --> 44:18.862
[chatter and water splashing]

44:23.931 --> 44:25.241
- Oh my God.

44:38.482 --> 44:39.517
- Kick to me.

44:39.586 --> 44:42.103
- No.
- Come on.

44:42.172 --> 44:44.275
Kick to me.

44:47.586 --> 44:49.896
Kick to me.

44:49.965 --> 44:52.379
- Why can't I just swim to you?!

44:54.103 --> 44:58.137
Not a word.
Not a goddamm word.

44:58.206 --> 45:00.689
- We need to isolate the muscles
without overstressing them.

45:00.758 --> 45:02.310
- Fine.

45:05.758 --> 45:06.965
Stop moving back.

45:07.034 --> 45:08.724
- You're doing great.

45:08.793 --> 45:11.000
- Stop moving.
You're moving back.

45:11.068 --> 45:12.586
- Okay, let's
go back the other way.

45:12.655 --> 45:14.344
- I don't need the kickboard.

45:14.413 --> 45:15.965
- Need to use the kickboard.

45:16.034 --> 45:17.551
Come on.
One more time...

45:22.551 --> 45:24.379
Let's go.

45:32.517 --> 45:35.448
- Just kick your leg up
and back slowly.

45:35.517 --> 45:36.896
- Okay.
- Now that the leg is straight,

45:36.965 --> 45:39.137
I want you to wiggle
your toes, okay?

45:39.206 --> 45:40.655
There you go.

45:40.724 --> 45:43.172
- Did they move?
- Mm-hm.

45:43.241 --> 45:44.689
So weird, I can't feel it.

45:44.758 --> 45:46.241
- It not your nerves--

45:46.310 --> 45:47.689
it's your brain's ability
to process the information

45:47.758 --> 45:48.793
your nerves are transmitting...

45:50.896 --> 45:52.103
- Sorry 'bout that.

45:52.172 --> 45:54.379
- You need to swim your laps
two lanes over.

45:59.965 --> 46:02.206
- Daddy! Daddy!

46:11.068 --> 46:12.689
Daddy.
