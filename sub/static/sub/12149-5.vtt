WEBVTT

00:06.129 --> 00:08.550
"I've had it with these
cheap trash bags.

00:09.130 --> 00:12.500
They leak and break
and end up costing us more."

00:16.329 --> 00:17.379
- I believe it.
- Yeah.

00:17.530 --> 00:18.789
It was a great audition.

00:19.329 --> 00:20.800
I was all about things leaking.

00:21.129 --> 00:22.570
How could they not pick me?

00:23.530 --> 00:25.809
- They don't know what they missed.
- They gave it to a blond...

00:27.730 --> 00:31.059
...in a skintight leather cat suit.
She's supposed to be a housewife.

00:31.329 --> 00:34.380
She looked like Catwoman
taking out the cat-trash.

00:35.530 --> 00:37.880
- You gonna answer the phone?
- Good question.

00:37.929 --> 00:38.799
Oh, yeah, right.

00:39.130 --> 00:41.090
- Angel Investigations,
- Machine got it.

00:41.530 --> 00:44.020
We help the helpless,
If that's you, leave a message,

00:45.130 --> 00:47.759
Hey, Cordy, It's Aura,
I just wanted to check in...

00:48.130 --> 00:49.920
...see how you're doing
and everything,

00:50.530 --> 00:52.000
You would not believe what....

00:52.329 --> 00:53.799
You don't want to talk to her?

00:54.130 --> 00:55.179
Not just yet.

00:55.929 --> 00:59.259
She's gonna ask me about where
I'm living, how the acting's going.

00:59.530 --> 01:01.740
I'm just not up for leading
the parade of pain.

01:02.530 --> 01:05.719
- I'll do it when things are better.
- I can't help with the acting.

01:07.930 --> 01:09.329
- But about the apartment--
- What?

01:10.329 --> 01:14.090
Well, if you ever want to spend
one night away from the place...

01:15.730 --> 01:17.099
...maybe give me a call.

01:18.129 --> 01:20.549
Well, stranger things have happened.

01:21.129 --> 01:22.140
No, wait.

01:22.329 --> 01:23.489
They really haven't.

01:25.329 --> 01:27.010
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:28.329 --> 01:30.579
Bye, Angel. I'm taking off.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:40.930 --> 01:42.959
She's really something, isn't she?

01:43.329 --> 01:45.859
It's like wrestling a tiger
just to get to know her.

01:48.730 --> 01:50.829
- Tell me stuff.
- What stuff?

01:51.730 --> 01:52.640
About Cordelia.

01:54.730 --> 01:57.120
Well, I know she can't type or file.

01:57.730 --> 02:00.079
Till today, I had some hope
regarding the phone.

02:00.730 --> 02:02.060
Who's Aura?

02:03.129 --> 02:06.430
Oh, she's.... I think she's
one of Cordelia's group.

02:07.930 --> 02:09.750
People called them "The Cordettes."

02:10.330 --> 02:13.419
Girls from wealthy families.
They ruled the high school.

02:13.930 --> 02:17.650
It was like the Soviet secret police,
if they cared a lot about shoes.

02:18.129 --> 02:21.110
And she was the richest one of all,
because the way she talks...

02:21.729 --> 02:23.939
...sounds like she had servants
made of solid gold.

02:24.729 --> 02:26.979
Pretty much.
Till her parents lost it all.

02:27.729 --> 02:30.080
- Riches to rags.
- That's one hell of a comedown.

02:31.930 --> 02:33.370
But she's doing all right,

02:38.530 --> 02:40.780
Ouch! Damn it!

03:04.930 --> 03:07.490
Yeah, well. Of course.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.819
Hi, this is Cordelia Chase
from apartment 4B.

03:28.930 --> 03:31.949
I thought you were gonna have
the exterminator in here today.

03:32.530 --> 03:34.460
Well, if he had,
wouldn't there be--?

03:36.729 --> 03:37.960
Oh, my God!

03:39.129 --> 03:41.800
Doyle. Doyle. Doyle. Doyle....

03:52.330 --> 03:53.629
Hello, Doyle.

04:46.370 --> 04:48.540
- You have the wrong place.
- You owe money.

04:50.569 --> 04:52.779
It's all about money.

04:52.970 --> 04:55.779
What about friendship, family
and priceless things...

04:56.569 --> 04:58.639
...like they say
in the credit card commercial?

05:00.170 --> 05:02.129
Oh, yeah, right.

05:02.569 --> 05:04.779
You're a demon of focus.
I can see that.

05:07.370 --> 05:09.050
I have your money right over here.

05:15.170 --> 05:17.939
You're not stupid enough
to have a gun in there. Right?

05:18.769 --> 05:20.490
Me? No way, man. Look!

05:44.569 --> 05:45.769
All right, all right.

05:45.769 --> 05:46.889
Oh, God, Angel.

05:47.569 --> 05:49.889
It's so terrible. Oh, my gosh.

05:50.569 --> 05:53.269
Don't even look at me.
I am such a mess.

05:53.569 --> 05:55.110
I am the lowest of the lowest.

05:55.970 --> 05:58.740
You're gonna want to get
my other suitcase out in the hall.

06:00.170 --> 06:01.680
- What happened?
- My apartment.

06:01.970 --> 06:03.160
It's like the barrio or...

06:04.370 --> 06:05.569
...the projects or whatever.

06:05.569 --> 06:08.199
And I live there.
I am a girl from the projects.

06:09.170 --> 06:10.569
I don't know about that.

06:10.970 --> 06:13.740
Get this. I tried to call Doyle--
I have sunk that low.

06:13.970 --> 06:16.360
And there was no answer,
so here I am.

06:16.970 --> 06:20.970
Not that you were the last resort,
but I had nowhere else to go.

06:21.769 --> 06:23.139
Roaches.

06:24.170 --> 06:28.000
Live ones, dead ones.
All skinny feet and creepy antlers.

06:28.970 --> 06:30.230
- Antlers?
- Oh, my God.

06:30.769 --> 06:32.449
I wonder how many are in that bag.

06:33.170 --> 06:36.579
Also, the water is all brown
and spurty and not hot.

06:37.970 --> 06:41.519
I am dying for a shower.
I actually smell.

06:42.769 --> 06:44.769
Smell me. I never smell.

06:45.170 --> 06:46.329
I didn't know I could.

06:47.569 --> 06:51.009
I'll have to stay here until I find
a place, however long that takes.

06:51.769 --> 06:53.310
When I do,
you're invited over.

06:54.170 --> 06:56.199
You can just dump my stuff
on your couch...

06:56.569 --> 06:59.129
...or let me have the bed,
whatever you feel good about.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.970
My suitcase is still out in the hall.

07:01.970 --> 07:04.319
Your shower's in here, right?
Do you have mousse?

07:06.769 --> 07:08.000
Of course you do.

07:38.410 --> 07:40.300
- Angel, you around?
- Hey, Doyle.

07:45.009 --> 07:48.060
You ever get that feeling
like you just can't shower enough...

07:49.209 --> 07:50.610
...like you'll never be clean?

07:51.009 --> 07:53.079
- You got peanut butter on the bed.
- Really?

07:55.209 --> 07:56.149
I don't think so.

07:58.209 --> 07:59.329
I'll look.

08:01.810 --> 08:03.139
No, no, no, no, no.

08:03.610 --> 08:04.620
Angel, how could you?

08:05.410 --> 08:06.600
How could I what?

08:07.209 --> 08:10.120
You know I was crazy about her.
I was wearing her down too.

08:10.810 --> 08:13.480
But, no. Handsome, brooding
vampire guy has to swoop in...

08:13.810 --> 08:15.949
...all sensitive mouth
and overhanging forehead.

08:16.810 --> 08:20.040
How about leaving some scraps
for the homely-looking fellas?

08:20.410 --> 08:23.529
Something's wrong with her place.
I was on the sofa.

08:28.810 --> 08:30.389
That's okay, I suppose.

08:30.610 --> 08:34.750
At some point in recent history,
you got peanut butter on the bed.

08:36.009 --> 08:38.039
It's gross.
You'd better change the sheets.

08:38.409 --> 08:39.350
I don't eat.

08:39.610 --> 08:42.029
Then I don't even want to know
how it got there.

08:45.610 --> 08:47.049
Hey, you're looking great.

08:48.009 --> 08:50.360
I wouldn't know.
Man doesn't have a mirror.

08:50.409 --> 08:52.269
Like it'd kill him
to not see himself?

08:54.610 --> 08:56.710
I was wondering
if anybody called lately...

08:57.610 --> 08:59.779
...maybe asking about me
or wanting my address?

09:00.009 --> 09:01.059
Your cousin called...

09:01.809 --> 09:04.299
...with one of those names
from your part of England.

09:04.809 --> 09:08.039
- My part of England?
- Connor or Fergus-- Did he find you?

09:10.210 --> 09:12.139
Yeah. He did, all right.

09:13.210 --> 09:15.210
A little warning
might have been nice.

09:15.610 --> 09:18.100
Give a fella a chance
to neat the place up.

09:19.809 --> 09:22.230
Jeez, I only helped the guy
as a favor to you.

09:24.610 --> 09:26.289
Maybe next time I won't bother.

09:27.009 --> 09:29.080
You don't even have to
pick up the phone.

09:29.409 --> 09:31.059
You just let Aura hang there.

09:31.809 --> 09:33.419
Okay, here's an idea.

09:33.610 --> 09:36.309
Give me a list of the people
you're too good to talk to.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.210
- What's going on?
- Nothing. Just....

09:40.210 --> 09:43.019
- You got a bruise on your hand.
- Badminton.

09:43.809 --> 09:46.549
And the reason there's a wet towel
on my leather chair?

09:51.610 --> 09:52.799
Thank you.

10:05.409 --> 10:06.779
What are you doing?

10:08.409 --> 10:11.919
I just wanted to see if he had
hardwood floors under here.

10:12.610 --> 10:14.330
I might be here awhile.

10:15.610 --> 10:16.809
The things you learn.

10:16.809 --> 10:19.649
I had no idea Angel
was Queen of the Winter Ball.

10:21.610 --> 10:22.940
Those are mine.

10:25.210 --> 10:26.259
Tough stuff!

10:29.409 --> 10:30.740
Your diploma's all burned.

10:31.809 --> 10:33.740
Yeah. It was a rough ceremony.

10:35.409 --> 10:36.389
Yeah.

10:37.210 --> 10:38.220
There it is.

10:38.409 --> 10:40.159
My whole life, pre-here.

10:40.809 --> 10:43.370
Five trophies,
with some of the shiny worn off.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.279
It's good you can look back.

10:46.210 --> 10:47.750
- I never look back.
- At what?

10:48.009 --> 10:48.919
Doyle.

10:49.210 --> 10:51.460
Is he down here? There you are.

10:52.210 --> 10:53.580
A big guy's here to see you.

10:54.009 --> 10:56.110
- I'll tell him you'll be right up.
- Okay, great.

11:07.809 --> 11:09.320
It's not nice to trick people.

11:09.610 --> 11:11.220
You gonna tell me what's going on?

11:15.610 --> 11:18.029
You don't even know
who the demon's collecting for.

11:18.610 --> 11:19.730
Here's how it works.

11:20.409 --> 11:22.200
I owe some people,
other people owe me.

11:22.809 --> 11:26.360
I do a favor, the debt goes away.
It's a system of checks and balances.

11:27.009 --> 11:28.759
Some of your checks didn't balance.

11:29.409 --> 11:30.490
Well, it'll work out.

11:30.610 --> 11:32.360
It just takes a little diplomacy.

11:33.009 --> 11:35.470
The kind of thing you're
so good at, actually. Maybe...

11:36.009 --> 11:37.340
...you could take a crack at it.

11:37.809 --> 11:38.860
We all have problems.

11:39.610 --> 11:41.779
At the moment, I have
a bigger one than you do.

11:42.009 --> 11:44.039
- Bigger than a Kailiff demon?
- Much.

11:44.409 --> 11:47.220
You can help me with mine,
and I can help you with yours.

11:48.009 --> 11:51.340
I don't know, man.
I mean, what's your problem exactly...

11:52.210 --> 11:53.080
...because vampire business is....

11:54.610 --> 11:55.730
Hi.

11:58.210 --> 12:00.379
I was wondering
if you had any linoleum glue...

12:01.210 --> 12:03.740
...for if it started
curling up all over.

12:05.409 --> 12:06.490
I'll be there soon.

12:07.809 --> 12:08.929
Okay.

12:10.809 --> 12:13.620
Find her an apartment,
and I'll deal with your demon.

12:16.730 --> 12:18.240
I wish you'd let me call my guy.

12:18.529 --> 12:20.850
He probably judges
the property value...

12:21.529 --> 12:23.879
...on how far the bus ride is
to the track.

12:24.529 --> 12:26.139
It can't get any worse than this.

12:26.929 --> 12:28.370
You can't tell from the hallway.

12:30.529 --> 12:33.200
Hey, you're right.
You know what I smell in here?

12:34.730 --> 12:36.029
Potential.

12:37.129 --> 12:38.360
The next one'll be better.

12:45.529 --> 12:46.649
It's like a community.

12:47.330 --> 12:49.120
We share all the upkeep and chores.

12:49.730 --> 12:51.899
My urination hasn't been
public enough lately.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.129
We don't believe in barriers.

12:54.529 --> 12:56.460
It's the first rule
of the Great Leader.

12:56.929 --> 12:58.929
You can come to meetings.
Mornings at 5.

12:59.330 --> 13:02.070
Okay. That's just a touch
too early for me.

13:02.929 --> 13:05.490
Oh, you'll be up.
The chanting starts at 4.

13:07.730 --> 13:11.419
So, you a single gal?
Gonna be living here alone?

13:11.929 --> 13:13.159
I'm right across the hall.

13:13.730 --> 13:14.929
You can sleep easy knowing...

13:14.929 --> 13:17.700
...I'm the only other soul
with a key to that door.

13:18.529 --> 13:20.779
You think about that
while you look, okay?

13:25.730 --> 13:29.169
Okay, just out of curiosity,
you say you know a guy?

13:29.929 --> 13:33.019
What is it with you and Angel?
You do everything the hard way.

14:10.129 --> 14:12.940
Oh, my gosh. Have you ever seen
anything so beautiful?

14:14.929 --> 14:16.649
No. Never.

14:17.929 --> 14:19.299
It's perfect.

14:19.730 --> 14:22.990
Really, really, it's just perfect.

14:34.129 --> 14:35.250
It's amazing in there.

14:35.929 --> 14:38.389
- What's wrong with it?
- Nothing's wrong with it.

14:38.929 --> 14:41.100
The previous tenant
just broke their lease.

14:41.330 --> 14:43.190
I don't know how you heard about it.

14:44.929 --> 14:47.419
It's quite a bargain.
And the furniture comes with.

14:47.929 --> 14:48.980
Do you think you want it?

14:49.129 --> 14:51.090
I used to have this. I was--

14:51.529 --> 14:54.440
- I guess it's your lucky day.
- I used to have those too.

14:55.730 --> 14:58.570
- Yeah, she'll take it.
- I'll fill out the rental forms.

15:01.730 --> 15:04.220
First thing, I hire someone
to take out that wall.

15:04.730 --> 15:07.330
- I thought it was perfect.
- And part of it being perfect...

15:07.730 --> 15:09.940
...is there being one tiny flaw
for me to fix.

15:10.730 --> 15:12.799
Must be why you find me
so fascinating.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.129
Oh, my gosh. I love my apartment!

15:16.129 --> 15:18.940
Your guy found the perfect place.
I love your guy!

15:20.929 --> 15:22.929
It's a pretty good day's work for us.

15:23.330 --> 15:24.730
I take care of your problem...

15:25.129 --> 15:27.549
...Angel takes care of mine.
Things are pretty sweet.

15:28.730 --> 15:31.049
Yes! I can move right in.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.629
- My name's Angel. What's yours?
- Screw you.

15:53.809 --> 15:56.159
My name's Angel. What's yours?

15:58.610 --> 16:00.710
- Griff.
- Good start. Who do you work for?

16:01.610 --> 16:03.360
He never gave me his card.

16:07.009 --> 16:08.519
I don't know his name.

16:09.409 --> 16:11.580
- You can get a message back to him?
- Yeah.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.240
- You're letting me go?
- I'm letting you up.

16:19.610 --> 16:22.070
- You were sent to collect for Doyle?
- At first.

16:22.610 --> 16:24.259
But I'm not seeing any money.

16:25.009 --> 16:27.610
So now Doyle gets dead.
A message for the others.

16:28.009 --> 16:29.659
And your boss never gets his money.

16:30.409 --> 16:32.440
Expensive message,
with what he's paying you.

16:32.809 --> 16:34.139
My fees are competitive.

16:34.610 --> 16:37.309
I can get Doyle to pay you.
You have my guarantee.

16:39.409 --> 16:41.019
I saw what I saw, right?

16:44.210 --> 16:45.580
You're a vampire.

16:47.210 --> 16:49.629
How come you're helping
some demon half-breed7.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.529
It's a good offer.
You should take it.

16:53.809 --> 16:56.200
On the other hand,
you're making me want to fight.

16:56.809 --> 16:58.769
You get lucky,
you might last 10 minutes.

16:59.210 --> 17:02.090
Really lucky, and you're unconscious
for the last five.

17:05.809 --> 17:08.579
You get Doyle to pay, and he's safe.

17:08.809 --> 17:09.680
Thanks.

17:11.809 --> 17:12.970
Good meeting.

17:43.609 --> 17:47.509
What do you think you're doing
here? You never should have come,

17:53.210 --> 17:54.509
I have to pay?

17:55.009 --> 17:57.079
Man, I should have
just handled this myself.

17:58.009 --> 18:01.200
I don't have the money.
You can't get blood out of a stone.

18:01.609 --> 18:03.119
They can get blood out of you.

18:04.609 --> 18:07.589
There's a price on your head.
They weren't looking for money.

18:11.809 --> 18:15.069
Thanks, man.
You probably saved my life.

18:17.210 --> 18:18.650
Can I ask you something?

18:19.609 --> 18:22.490
- Why do you live like this?
- Well, what's wrong with it?

18:28.009 --> 18:29.170
Yeah, well...

18:29.809 --> 18:31.670
...I guess it's the kind of life...

18:32.210 --> 18:34.630
...that keeps your expectations
from getting too high.

18:36.410 --> 18:38.230
- Seems like you'd understand.
- I do.

18:38.809 --> 18:39.750
Yeah.

18:40.609 --> 18:42.539
I don't know why
it's important to you.

18:43.009 --> 18:45.400
This kind of life sort of picked me.

18:46.609 --> 18:48.329
You don't have to do it this way.

18:48.410 --> 18:50.200
- What happened?
- Don't worry about it.

18:50.809 --> 18:53.549
And things aren't all gloom
in Doyle City.

18:55.609 --> 18:58.210
I mean, there's bright spots.
Like Cordelia.

18:58.609 --> 19:00.890
I mean, she loves
that new place so much, man.

19:01.609 --> 19:03.500
She's gonna be grateful
for a long time.

19:27.609 --> 19:29.960
I knew this was too good to be true.
I knew it.

19:30.609 --> 19:33.660
I'm from Sunnydale!
You're not scaring me, you know!

19:34.210 --> 19:35.930
You're not scaring me.

19:37.210 --> 19:38.750
You're not scaring me...

19:39.009 --> 19:40.339
...one bit.

20:07.210 --> 20:09.529
Bright, shiny morning.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.680
Nothing bad here.

20:40.809 --> 20:42.460
You know what? I get it.

20:42.609 --> 20:45.769
You're a ghost. You're dead.
Big accomplishment. Move on!

20:46.809 --> 20:48.279
You see a light anywhere?

20:48.609 --> 20:50.640
Go towards it. Okay?

20:54.009 --> 20:55.900
Cold wind. Scary.

20:56.410 --> 20:58.799
What are you gonna do,
chap me to death?

20:59.410 --> 21:00.109
What else you got?

21:01.809 --> 21:03.559
Cordelia, you in there?

21:06.009 --> 21:07.170
Cordelia?

21:13.210 --> 21:15.170
Cactus. It's a housewarming present.

21:15.609 --> 21:17.259
Hi. Thanks.

21:18.009 --> 21:19.940
I'm still getting it
the way I want it.

21:21.009 --> 21:22.019
Maybe in a few days.

21:22.210 --> 21:24.490
The place looks great.
You worry too much.

21:24.609 --> 21:26.609
But what did you have
against that chair?

21:28.210 --> 21:29.680
Oh, right, you can't come in.

21:31.210 --> 21:32.650
Wait. What about the rule?

21:33.009 --> 21:35.430
You said when you got a place,
I was invited over.

21:36.009 --> 21:38.819
I didn't have a place then.
The rules are getting screwed up!

21:39.609 --> 21:41.470
- Don't touch that!
- I'm closing these...

21:42.009 --> 21:44.329
...so our boss doesn't
burst into flames. Okay?

21:45.009 --> 21:46.900
Yeah. I guess.

21:48.009 --> 21:49.309
It's nice.

21:51.009 --> 21:52.269
How about a tour?

21:52.809 --> 21:55.579
The kitchen, living room.
I'll knock out that wall.

21:55.809 --> 21:58.440
- Thanks for the cactus.
- How can you afford this?

22:08.410 --> 22:11.250
I bet you want lunch.
There's a place down the street--

22:13.210 --> 22:15.529
That thing's been doing that
all morning.

22:16.210 --> 22:17.680
I think the mantle is uneven.

22:18.609 --> 22:19.589
It lunged at me.

22:21.609 --> 22:22.619
What's going on?

22:22.809 --> 22:25.230
Okay, you're right.
It's not the mantle.

22:25.809 --> 22:27.599
It's a very, very bad trophy.

22:34.809 --> 22:36.740
- Dear sweet....
- Come on.

22:39.009 --> 22:40.309
I'm not giving up this place.

22:40.809 --> 22:42.180
- It's haunted.
- It's rent-controlled!

22:42.609 --> 22:44.500
- It says, "Die."
- Maybe it's not done yet.

22:45.009 --> 22:48.700
Maybe it's "Diet." That's friendly,
if a little judgmental, sure.

22:49.210 --> 22:51.740
I am not giving it up.
It's perfect and beautiful.

22:52.809 --> 22:54.009
It's so me. I need it.

22:54.009 --> 22:55.059
It's just a place.

22:55.809 --> 22:58.579
- You're more than that.
- How? How am I more than that?

22:58.809 --> 23:01.509
We could cleanse it.
We could try. Can't we?

23:02.410 --> 23:03.670
Put the ghost to rest.

23:04.210 --> 23:05.119
- Can we?
- We can try.

23:05.410 --> 23:07.900
- We'll figure it out at the office.
- Okay.

23:09.609 --> 23:12.099
Listen good, Casper!
You haven't won a thing!

23:12.609 --> 23:15.240
I'll die before I give up
this apartment! I'll die!

23:16.210 --> 23:18.880
All right, dear,
If that's what you think is best,

23:22.690 --> 23:24.269
A lot here about the building.

23:24.490 --> 23:27.509
- Construction bids, inspections--
- We need people who lived there.

23:28.089 --> 23:30.259
And died there.
The ingredients for ghosts.

23:31.089 --> 23:32.880
Yeah. This isn't easy, you know.

23:37.089 --> 23:39.480
You know, this really
is just a place to live.

23:40.089 --> 23:42.509
No, it's more. It's beautiful.

23:43.690 --> 23:45.859
- And if it goes away, it's like--
- Like what?

23:47.289 --> 23:49.359
- Like I'm still getting punished.
- Punished?

23:51.490 --> 23:53.309
- For what?
- I don't know.

23:53.890 --> 23:56.660
For how I was. For everything
I said in high school...

23:57.490 --> 23:59.140
...because I could get away with it.

23:59.289 --> 24:01.779
And then it all ended,
and I had to pay.

24:03.490 --> 24:05.740
But this apartment--
I could be me again.

24:06.490 --> 24:08.740
Punishment over.
Welcome back to your life.

24:08.890 --> 24:12.299
Like I couldn't be that awful
if I get a place like that.

24:13.089 --> 24:14.029
It's just like you.

24:14.890 --> 24:16.009
Working for redemption.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.400
No, because you had that mansion.

24:19.690 --> 24:20.809
I found something.

24:21.490 --> 24:23.700
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a death.

24:23.890 --> 24:26.450
First person to live in your place,
Maude Pearson.

24:26.890 --> 24:28.289
- How'd you get it?
- Pearson Arms...

24:28.690 --> 24:29.990
...is carved over the entrance.

24:30.490 --> 24:33.400
I checked the obits for Pearson.
We got lucky.

24:34.089 --> 24:36.720
Maude Pearson built the place
and took a unit there.

24:39.490 --> 24:41.490
In 1946, she died of a heart attack...

24:41.890 --> 24:43.640
...in Cordelia's living room
at age 57.

24:44.289 --> 24:45.799
That's it! That's her.

24:46.089 --> 24:47.319
It's not a violent death.

24:47.890 --> 24:49.710
- Ghosts are usually--
- I know it's her.

24:50.289 --> 24:52.779
The place has that weird
little-old-lady smell...

24:53.289 --> 24:54.660
...like violets and Aspercreme.

24:55.089 --> 24:58.500
They didn't find her for 3 weeks,
so it wasn't violets at the end.

24:59.289 --> 25:01.009
This is easy.
Little-old-lady ghost...

25:01.089 --> 25:03.579
...hanging around because
she left the iron on.

25:04.089 --> 25:05.839
Get a cleansing spell and do it.

25:06.490 --> 25:09.720
It's not easy.
Hawthorn berries, lungwort and bile.

25:10.089 --> 25:11.460
I can't get everything.

25:11.890 --> 25:15.609
I can. I know this guy in Koreatown,
does these spells all the time.

25:16.690 --> 25:18.089
Goody. One of Doyle's guys.

25:18.490 --> 25:20.349
Is this the same guy
that helped me find...

25:20.890 --> 25:22.539
...my poltergeist-elicious apartment?

25:23.890 --> 25:26.559
Doyle, go. Get what you need.

25:31.089 --> 25:34.849
I'm gonna try to get more information.
Maybe Kate can find something.

25:37.089 --> 25:40.500
How come Patrick Swayze's
never dead when you need him?

25:45.490 --> 25:47.910
Angel Investigations,
We help the hopeless,

25:48.490 --> 25:50.279
If that's you, leave a message,

25:50.890 --> 25:52.259
Cordelia, are you there?

25:52.690 --> 25:54.269
I think we can end this thing,

25:54.490 --> 25:57.119
I'm here. About time you called.
You got something?

25:57.490 --> 25:59.589
Meet me at your apartment,
We'll figure out what to do,

26:00.490 --> 26:01.650
Okay.

26:18.490 --> 26:20.950
Cordelia, I'm in the bedroom.

26:28.089 --> 26:29.279
Angel?

26:39.490 --> 26:40.470
You got my call.

26:53.890 --> 26:55.119
Poor thing.

26:55.690 --> 26:57.900
You just don't fit in
around here, do you?

26:58.690 --> 27:01.359
Oh, too bad you wouldn't
leave my son alone.

27:02.289 --> 27:03.690
Your son?

27:06.089 --> 27:07.890
- I wish I could be more help.
- It's okay.

27:07.890 --> 27:10.349
Just knowing things
that didn't happen is a help.

27:10.890 --> 27:13.140
- Now you're talking like a detective.
- I am one.

27:14.490 --> 27:16.700
The thing about detectives is,
they have résumés...

27:17.490 --> 27:19.170
...business licenses and last names.

27:21.089 --> 27:23.829
- Pop stars and popes have one name.
- I'm a pope.

27:28.289 --> 27:29.410
Here you go.

27:30.690 --> 27:32.829
Davis, you are beautiful. Thank you.

27:33.690 --> 27:35.059
Let's take a look.

27:37.289 --> 27:39.009
I didn't know you had
records that old.

27:39.690 --> 27:41.339
Me neither. Let's see.

27:42.089 --> 27:44.119
There was an investigation
into the death.

27:49.289 --> 27:52.410
This guy, Detective Randall,
thought the death was suspicious.

27:53.490 --> 27:55.170
The M.E. called it a heart attack...

27:55.289 --> 27:57.750
...but there were problems
with the son, Dennis Pearson.

27:58.890 --> 28:01.380
- He lived with her. They argued a lot.
- What about?

28:04.289 --> 28:06.779
A girl. His fiancée.
Mom didn't like her.

28:09.089 --> 28:12.599
Dennis skips town with her the day
Mom dies. What a coincidence.

28:13.289 --> 28:15.250
- Cops never caught him.
- Unavenged murder.

28:15.690 --> 28:18.430
- Sounds like.
- But no other deaths in the apartment.

28:18.690 --> 28:21.779
You saw me check. No murders.
Not even domestic dispute calls.

28:22.890 --> 28:24.920
No, not murders. Suicides.

28:27.089 --> 28:29.299
There's a kind of killer
that does that.

28:30.089 --> 28:31.880
Makes it look like a suicide.

28:35.490 --> 28:37.000
There are always signs.

28:40.890 --> 28:42.049
There.

28:44.490 --> 28:46.309
Margo Dressner, 1959.

28:46.890 --> 28:48.710
And Jenny Kim, 1965.

28:49.289 --> 28:50.730
Natalie Davis, 5 years ago.

28:51.089 --> 28:53.049
All in the same apartment.

28:53.490 --> 28:54.859
I've gotta make a call.

29:13.890 --> 29:15.329
Angel Investigations.

29:15.690 --> 29:17.160
We hope you're helpless.

29:18.089 --> 29:19.769
- Wait--
- It's me. Put Cordelia on.

29:20.490 --> 29:22.740
She's not here.
Hang on, there's a message.

29:23.490 --> 29:24.359
Are you there?

29:24.690 --> 29:25.990
We can end this thing,

29:26.490 --> 29:28.880
I'm here, About time
you called, You got something?

29:29.490 --> 29:31.309
Meet me at your apartment,
We'll figure out what to do,

29:31.890 --> 29:33.220
That's not me.

29:34.890 --> 29:39.029
Whoever you think you're talking to,
it's not me. My name is Cordelia.

29:39.690 --> 29:42.079
Oh, that's the name of a cheap,
small-town tramp...

29:42.690 --> 29:44.789
...trying to sound better than she is.

29:46.289 --> 29:49.519
You're not good enough for my boy.
This will never be your home.

29:49.890 --> 29:52.839
This is my home.
My friends will come here.

29:53.490 --> 29:54.789
You don't have friends.

29:55.289 --> 29:58.200
Why would anyone care about you?
Nobody really cares.

29:58.890 --> 30:00.920
You don't deserve to live here.

30:01.289 --> 30:04.059
You don't deserve anything.

30:08.490 --> 30:10.839
We were right about the ghost.
It's Mrs. Pearson.

30:11.490 --> 30:13.630
- Her son killed her.
- A murder victim?

30:13.890 --> 30:17.609
Filled with rage and confusion.
That's why she's been killing people.

30:18.690 --> 30:20.480
That's a pretty strong ghost.

30:21.089 --> 30:23.190
Bile. I should've got more bile.

30:25.890 --> 30:27.049
I will leave. Please.

30:27.089 --> 30:28.630
Oh, I don't think so.

30:30.690 --> 30:32.019
- You're worthless.
- No.

30:32.490 --> 30:34.380
You've never been kind or smart.

30:34.890 --> 30:36.470
You're a user. You're nothing.

30:36.690 --> 30:38.859
Everyone would be glad
if you were dead.

30:39.089 --> 30:40.769
- No.
- Oh, come on.

30:41.490 --> 30:44.160
If anyone really cared about you,
would you be here?

30:45.089 --> 30:49.339
People let you end up here because
they were happy to see you fail.

30:58.289 --> 31:00.890
I got her. Okay. All right.

31:03.690 --> 31:06.289
The furniture and the wall
and the blood.

31:06.690 --> 31:09.289
She's doing it. She's doing it all.

31:10.289 --> 31:12.180
She'll be back.
She's stronger than us.

31:12.690 --> 31:13.880
She knows me.

31:13.890 --> 31:16.730
- We can stop her.
- No. No, we can't stop her.

31:18.089 --> 31:19.599
She's made a connection with you.

31:19.890 --> 31:22.279
She thinks you're someone
she blames for her murder.

31:22.890 --> 31:24.500
- Answer me.
- I'm, I'm....

31:24.690 --> 31:28.759
I'm taking her son away.
She thinks I'm taking her son.

31:29.490 --> 31:31.490
That's good. Her son killed her.

31:32.490 --> 31:35.259
You're playing a role in her delusion.
You can stop her.

31:36.690 --> 31:39.039
Start the binding circle.
I'll find the spell.

31:46.890 --> 31:48.609
"Bring the truth into the light.

31:49.289 --> 31:52.619
Let it be revealed that the soul
can take its place in eternity."

31:55.289 --> 31:57.109
She's coming!
She knows what we're doing!

31:57.690 --> 31:59.440
- We need Cordelia now.
- Cordy, get up!

32:07.890 --> 32:10.380
Cordelia, stand in the circle!
Strike at its center!

32:10.890 --> 32:11.759
What?

32:12.690 --> 32:15.319
You know what it means.
She's in contact with you.

32:16.289 --> 32:18.890
They don't care about you.
They want you to fail.

32:19.289 --> 32:22.059
- You're a whore with no money.
- Doyle, chant.

32:22.890 --> 32:26.299
Oh, man, Latin! One of those dead
languages you always mean to learn!

32:27.089 --> 32:29.259
V sounds like W.
Say each vowel separately.

32:30.690 --> 32:32.829
You do know what to do.
You can stop all this.

32:33.690 --> 32:35.200
I can't.

32:35.490 --> 32:38.160
Look at you.
You're gonna let her do this to you?

32:39.089 --> 32:40.950
Damn it! You're Cordelia Chase.

32:41.490 --> 32:44.329
Are you just gonna lie there?
Get off your ass! Be tough!

32:45.089 --> 32:46.630
I can't, I can't!

32:46.890 --> 32:48.849
You can be the biggest pain.
Do it now!

32:54.089 --> 32:56.049
- This won't work.
- It's getting dodgy here!

32:58.289 --> 33:00.750
We gotta get her out of here.
This isn't safe.

33:06.690 --> 33:07.849
Nobody's going anywhere.

33:15.329 --> 33:17.259
- What's this?
- You were gonna let him pay.

33:17.730 --> 33:18.809
I lied.

33:19.529 --> 33:21.279
No more people!

33:21.930 --> 33:24.099
- What is this?
- Ignore her. It's just a ghost.

33:25.529 --> 33:27.140
Get out!

33:35.730 --> 33:36.599
You broke it!

33:48.930 --> 33:51.140
I'm gonna pay!
I got it in my wallet!

33:51.930 --> 33:54.140
This is my house.

34:03.329 --> 34:04.380
Knives!

34:21.329 --> 34:23.500
I'll leave.
I'm sorry your son killed you.

34:23.730 --> 34:25.900
You can have the apartment.
Just let me go.

34:26.730 --> 34:28.530
- It's too late for that.
- No.

34:28.530 --> 34:30.320
You know what happens next.

34:32.730 --> 34:34.130
Your friends are dirty.

34:34.530 --> 34:36.210
They ruined my nice home.

34:44.130 --> 34:46.090
I knew you were trouble
from the start.

34:46.530 --> 34:48.530
I'm surprised
that my son didn't smell...

34:48.929 --> 34:51.000
...the stench of poverty
and failure on you.

34:51.929 --> 34:53.050
I can.

34:53.730 --> 34:55.268
I'm sorry.

34:56.130 --> 34:59.500
You better be sorry,
you stupid little bitch.

35:02.730 --> 35:03.920
I'm a bitch.

35:04.530 --> 35:06.739
Take off the bed sheets.
Make a noose.

35:07.530 --> 35:08.829
Go on.

35:09.329 --> 35:11.360
It'll all be over soon.

35:15.329 --> 35:18.449
I'm not a sniveling, whiny,
little cry-Buffy.

35:18.929 --> 35:21.880
I'm the nastiest girl
in Sunnydale history.

35:22.530 --> 35:24.420
I take crap from no one.

35:25.530 --> 35:28.829
You're going to make yourself
a noose and put it around--

35:29.130 --> 35:30.780
Back off, Polygrip!

35:32.730 --> 35:34.239
You think you're bad?

35:35.130 --> 35:36.780
All mean and haunty...

35:37.530 --> 35:40.059
...picking on poor, pathetic Cordy?

35:40.530 --> 35:44.670
Well, get ready to haul your wrinkly,
translucent ass out of this place...

35:45.329 --> 35:47.960
...because, lady, the bitch is back.

35:56.730 --> 35:59.780
Do you think I'm going to take that
from trash like you?

36:00.329 --> 36:01.730
I'll tell you what I think.

36:02.130 --> 36:04.199
You're gonna pack
your little ghost bags...

36:05.130 --> 36:07.019
...and get the hell out of my house!

36:24.329 --> 36:25.630
What happened? You did it.

36:26.130 --> 36:27.780
Yeah, well, she pissed me off.

36:28.530 --> 36:30.250
Well, maybe you found her center.

36:31.530 --> 36:32.860
Cordy, what's wrong?

36:38.730 --> 36:39.639
Cordelia!

37:10.289 --> 37:12.539
Look what you're making me do, Dennis.

37:13.289 --> 37:14.619
Mom, stop it.

37:15.090 --> 37:16.599
How you gonna leave now, huh?

37:16.889 --> 37:19.239
How you gonna marry
that streetwalker now?

37:19.889 --> 37:21.360
You are nothing without me.

37:21.690 --> 37:23.480
Mom, don't do this, please.

37:24.090 --> 37:25.559
This is crazy.

37:31.889 --> 37:33.679
Mom? I can't breathe.

37:34.289 --> 37:36.539
Please! Let me out!

37:37.289 --> 37:40.619
Please, Mom, I'll be good!
I won't leave you! I promise!

37:40.889 --> 37:42.010
Mom, please!

37:47.489 --> 37:49.380
This hurts me more than it hurts you.

37:50.489 --> 37:51.960
Goodbye, Dennis.

38:09.690 --> 38:10.769
Dennis, I presume.

38:11.489 --> 38:13.289
Probably not too happy
with his mum.

38:13.289 --> 38:15.960
Dennis, it was for your own good.

38:16.889 --> 38:18.079
I had to do it.

38:18.690 --> 38:21.389
She would've made your life
miserable. I'm sorry.

38:23.489 --> 38:25.630
Please! Please!

38:34.889 --> 38:36.820
I knew I didn't like that wall.

38:47.489 --> 38:48.539
There.

38:49.289 --> 38:50.199
Safe as houses.

38:51.090 --> 38:52.630
You're gonna live like this?

38:54.090 --> 38:56.579
Adding a dead bolt won't have
a huge effect on my life.

38:57.090 --> 38:58.210
You know what I mean.

38:58.289 --> 39:00.710
Well, there might be
misunderstandings...

39:01.289 --> 39:02.550
...that sort of thing.

39:05.489 --> 39:08.159
- You know I'll help you out.
- For which I'm grateful.

39:09.690 --> 39:11.760
But sooner or later,
I'll need to hear it.

39:13.289 --> 39:15.780
- Hear what?
- The story of your life.

39:16.889 --> 39:18.050
And quite a tale it is.

39:18.690 --> 39:21.849
Full of ribald adventures,
beautiful damsels with loose morals.

39:22.289 --> 39:23.369
Doyle.

39:27.690 --> 39:28.739
I will.

39:30.090 --> 39:31.349
Just give me time.

39:35.489 --> 39:37.699
The past don't let go, does she?

39:39.690 --> 39:41.130
She never does.

39:43.570 --> 39:46.170
God, Aura, I can't believe
I've missed your calls.

39:47.170 --> 39:49.059
It's that incompetent girl at work.

39:49.570 --> 39:50.940
But things are going great.

39:51.369 --> 39:54.920
My new apartment, for one thing.
Celebrities are on top of me.

39:55.570 --> 39:59.190
Steve Paymer, that's Dave Paymer's
brother, lives right down the hall.

39:59.769 --> 40:01.349
You'd know him if you saw him.

40:01.570 --> 40:03.989
And my view, it's amazing.

40:04.570 --> 40:07.170
Yeah, I have a roommate.
But I never see him.

40:08.170 --> 40:10.340
Hey, hey, Phantom Dennis.
Put that back.

40:14.170 --> 40:15.570
All in all, it's working out great.

40:17.170 --> 40:19.130
Dennis, when I am on the phone,
that's quiet time.

40:21.969 --> 40:22.949
Thanks.

40:23.170 --> 40:24.989
Sorry. So where were we?

40:26.170 --> 40:27.920
Who's wearing what in Sunnydale?

40:29.170 --> 40:31.800
No! Well, she never
did have any taste.

40:33.570 --> 40:35.320
She's so nasty,

40:36.305 --> 40:42.747
