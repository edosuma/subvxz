03:13.560 --> 03:15.330
Major Pollock.

03:18.440 --> 03:20.119
Well, hello.

03:20.120 --> 03:21.731
What's this?

03:24.680 --> 03:27.201
I was rather worried about you.

03:27.280 --> 03:28.439
Worried? Why?

03:28.440 --> 03:32.167
- Has anybody been talking about me?
- No, Major.

03:32.800 --> 03:36.199
It's just that, when you were away
for these last two days, I...

03:36.200 --> 03:38.959
I see. Yes, I telephoned the hotel.

03:38.960 --> 03:42.239
I talked to Miss Cooper.
I told her I was visiting a friend.

03:42.240 --> 03:45.279
A company commander who served
under me in the desert campaigns

03:45.280 --> 03:47.799
ran into a bit of bad luck,
I thought I'd give him a hand.

03:47.800 --> 03:50.999
You're always trying to help
people, aren't you, Major?

03:51.000 --> 03:53.999
Well, yes, but the fellow
saved my life once,

03:54.000 --> 03:55.599
just outside of El Alamein.

03:55.600 --> 03:58.319
Pinned down. Short of petrol.
He was a good man.

03:58.320 --> 03:59.439
Yes.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.119
Mark you, Jerry in the desert
was a different cup of tea

04:02.120 --> 04:03.679
from Jerry on the Western Front.

04:03.680 --> 04:05.959
Were you in Normandy, too, Major?

04:05.960 --> 04:07.719
No, Desert Rats, you know.

04:07.720 --> 04:09.719
Still, we got to
Berlin, eventually.

04:09.720 --> 04:11.759
Berlin must have been depressing.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.399
Berlin depressing?

04:13.400 --> 04:15.919
What with all those
Fräuleins and Mädchens?

04:15.920 --> 04:17.519
I should say not.

04:17.519 --> 04:21.399
By Jove, I could tell you a thing
or two. Good life, yes, indeed.

04:21.399 --> 04:23.959
Let's go and get
brushed up for dinner.

04:23.960 --> 04:27.881
There you are, dear. Having
a stroll with the Major?

04:28.480 --> 04:30.519
- Yes, Mummy.
- Evening, Mrs. Railton-Bell.

04:30.520 --> 04:34.359
Good evening, Major. Had
your watch stopped, darling?

04:34.360 --> 04:36.449
No, Mummy, it's going.

04:37.440 --> 04:41.159
Well, the Major was telling me
all about the desert campaign.

04:41.160 --> 04:44.399
Sorry to have kept your pride and
joy out in the cold, Mrs. R-B.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.439
The fact is, I got
on to the old days.

04:46.440 --> 04:49.479
That's the trouble with us
old retired warhorses, what?

04:49.480 --> 04:51.489
We all talk too much.

04:51.960 --> 04:54.447
Yes. Well, if you'll excuse me.

04:58.120 --> 04:59.999
Sibyl, my dearest.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.759
Do you mind if your tactless old
mother whispers something in your ear?

05:03.760 --> 05:04.959
No, Mummy.

05:04.960 --> 05:10.087
- Such a wonderful concert this afternoon.
- Yes. I'll join you in the game room.

05:10.120 --> 05:11.651
All right.

05:12.560 --> 05:15.119
It's just that, do
you think it wise,

05:15.120 --> 05:18.608
to make your feelings for
the Major quite so public?

05:18.720 --> 05:22.319
- My feelings for the Major?
- Yes, staring at him all the time.

05:22.320 --> 05:26.439
Talking to him for hours on end.
Those meetings down on the front.

05:26.440 --> 05:28.449
Quite a lot of people are
beginning to notice.

05:30.200 --> 05:33.688
You don't mean... You can't mean...

05:34.600 --> 05:37.519
No. How can people be so awful?

05:37.520 --> 05:41.279
Control yourself. Don't get
into one of your states now.

05:41.280 --> 05:44.370
It's all right, Mummy.
I'm not in a state.

05:45.840 --> 05:49.279
- Good evening, Mrs. Railton-Bell.
- Good evening, Miss Cooper.

05:49.280 --> 05:51.839
- Good evening, Sibyl.
- Evening, Miss Cooper.

05:51.840 --> 05:55.119
Dear, I think you better run
upstairs and change for dinner.

05:55.120 --> 05:58.881
You know Miss Cooper
likes us to be punctual.

05:58.960 --> 06:02.359
Stratton, still at it, I see.
I don't know how you do it.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.119
Most praiseworthy effort.

06:04.120 --> 06:05.319
Thank you, Major.

06:05.320 --> 06:08.799
When I was at Sandhurst...
I'm sorry, I mustn't interrupt you.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.079
That's all right. When
you were at Sandhurst?

06:11.080 --> 06:14.479
Yes, I was just going to say,
when I was at Sandhurst

06:14.480 --> 06:17.919
and when I was at Wellington, too,
I was a bit like you, you know.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.279
Sweating away at the
books all the time.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.079
Cramming away like mad, I was.

06:22.080 --> 06:24.679
Military history, great
battles of the past,

06:24.680 --> 06:26.799
Clausewitz and all
that sort of stuff.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.439
I could have told you a
lot about Clausewitz.

06:29.440 --> 06:32.959
- Really, sir? And you can't now?
- Not anymore, I'm afraid.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.479
Everything goes, you know.

06:35.480 --> 06:37.319
Still, I don't regret it.

06:37.320 --> 06:39.159
I did jolly well at Sandhurst.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.567
Did you get the Sword
of Honor, sir?

06:41.640 --> 06:43.365
Get the what?

06:43.600 --> 06:46.039
- The Sword of Honor.
- The Sword of Honor?

06:46.040 --> 06:49.119
No, I came close to it, though.
Passed out pretty high.

06:49.120 --> 06:50.919
You're quite right, sir.

06:50.920 --> 06:53.439
I'm sorry, my boy.
Go on. I talk too much.

06:53.440 --> 06:56.559
No, but Miss Cooper walked by
and you were looking for her.

06:56.560 --> 06:59.999
Did she? Yes, I want to have a
little chat with her. Thank you.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.679
Keep up the good work.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.882
- I'll try, sir.
- Good man.

07:07.880 --> 07:10.039
There we are, Miss Cooper.

07:10.040 --> 07:12.799
- What can I do for you, Major?
- Nothing important.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.079
They're sending me a copy of the
West Hampshire Weekly News.

07:16.080 --> 07:18.839
- I wondered if it had arrived.
- The West Hampshire News?

07:18.840 --> 07:21.319
Yes. I'm told they have a
good page of small ads.

07:21.320 --> 07:25.599
I might pick up a portable typewriter. I'm
taking a stab at the old war memoirs.

07:25.600 --> 07:28.559
If there are bargains, one
must be quick off the mark.

07:28.560 --> 07:30.959
Yes. There are some
things in my office.

07:30.960 --> 07:33.719
I haven't been through
them yet. I'll have a look.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.651
That's very good of you.
Thank you, Miss Cooper.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.919
I can't understand it.
There's still no answer.

07:47.920 --> 07:50.519
I'm so sorry, Mr. Fowler.
Will you excuse me?

07:50.520 --> 07:53.079
One of your old flames, Mr. Fowler?

07:53.080 --> 07:54.691
Old flames?

07:55.880 --> 07:58.799
No, it's an old pupil
coming down for a few days.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.919
I used to teach him
Classics at school.

08:00.920 --> 08:03.239
Rather backward I thought
him in those days.

08:03.240 --> 08:06.599
As far as old flames are concerned,
I leave all that to you galloping majors.

08:06.600 --> 08:10.043
Those days are all past
and gone now, I'm afraid.

08:16.560 --> 08:20.239
Weren't they teaching the new
pronunciation in your time at Wellington?

08:20.240 --> 08:23.399
Yes, of course. I forget now.
I never was much of a hand at Greek.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.728
Latin. Horace.

08:25.800 --> 08:28.399
Latin. Yes, of course.
Stupid of me.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.719
Here we are, Major.

08:29.720 --> 08:32.039
Good show. Thank you, Miss Cooper.

08:32.039 --> 08:35.958
I think, if you don't mind, I'd
like you to still keep the room.

08:35.960 --> 08:39.801
- After all, he may be on the later train.
- Yes, of course.

08:39.840 --> 08:43.359
And if anything has gone
wrong, which I don't believe,

08:43.360 --> 08:45.599
I shall, of course,
expect to pay for it.

08:45.600 --> 08:48.246
Will you let me know when you can?

08:52.840 --> 08:57.648
By the by, Major, you were in the Highland
Division at Alamein, weren't you?

08:58.440 --> 09:00.399
Not in the Highland Division, no.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.519
- I thought you were.
- I never said so.

09:02.520 --> 09:04.199
I was just wondering...

09:04.200 --> 09:06.279
Mr. Fowler, aren't we
going to finish this game?

09:06.280 --> 09:08.639
We have a shilling on
it, if you'll remember.

09:08.640 --> 09:11.320
Yes, of course. Will you excuse me?

09:24.120 --> 09:26.687
- Good evening, Major Pollock.
- Good evening.

09:29.120 --> 09:31.039
So this is where
you've been hiding.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.079
I was not hiding. Now just shush.

09:33.080 --> 09:35.839
Forget your work for once and
let's go play billiards.

09:35.840 --> 09:39.886
But, darling, the anatomy exams
come up next month. Remember?

09:50.840 --> 09:52.530
Jean, really.

09:58.360 --> 10:02.360
Have you told your father about us?
What did you tell him?

10:03.200 --> 10:04.839
Charles, what did you tell him?

10:04.840 --> 10:08.199
For heaven's sake, that we
were in love with each other.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.159
And that we're going to be married.

10:10.160 --> 10:13.999
- Well, you told him a dirty lie.
- Why? I do want to marry you.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.279
I can never understand why...

10:15.280 --> 10:17.359
You know my views on
marriage very well.

10:17.360 --> 10:20.519
I intend to produce
paintings, not children.

10:20.520 --> 10:23.799
And be kept in luxury by London's
most celebrated surgeon.

10:23.800 --> 10:26.162
Who has failed to pass his anatomy.

10:26.200 --> 10:29.159
Charles? Let's go for
a walk in the garden.

10:29.160 --> 10:32.239
What? Darling, first it's
billiards, now it's a walk.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.442
But it looks so romantic.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.719
How can I possibly mix
anatomy with romance?

10:37.720 --> 10:40.241
That shouldn't be too difficult.

10:48.520 --> 10:51.963
Well, I'm obviously not
going to get any work done.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.639
Come on. The dinner gong
will go in 15 minutes.

10:54.640 --> 10:57.439
Where on earth are we going
to walk in 15 minutes?

10:57.440 --> 10:59.768
Charles, how dim can you be?

11:01.440 --> 11:04.405
I rather think we'd
better play billiards.

11:10.240 --> 11:12.204
Go in, you blighter.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.569
Bad luck, Mr. Fowler.

11:16.080 --> 11:18.647
I only play for exercise.

11:25.440 --> 11:28.484
That'll be a shilling,
please, Mr. Fowler.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.519
You'll ruin me, Miss Meacham.

11:30.520 --> 11:34.439
- Come on, Charles. They've finished.
- I'll take all your money.

11:34.440 --> 11:37.086
Poor Mr. Fowler, has he ever won?

11:38.000 --> 11:41.807
Once in 1948. It was her
Christmas present to him.

11:43.280 --> 11:47.007
There's stuffed pork tonight.
We ought to be ready for the gong.

11:47.960 --> 11:51.084
That, I expect, is young
Ridgewell at last.

11:53.560 --> 11:54.959
What is it?

11:54.960 --> 11:56.959
- New arrival, apparently.
- Great Scott.

11:56.960 --> 11:58.639
What is it, Miss Meacham?

11:58.640 --> 12:00.839
You should see for yourself.

12:00.840 --> 12:04.839
Slim as a willow, dressed like a
Parisian model and not a day over 30.

12:04.840 --> 12:08.442
This place is turning
into a regular nursery.

12:10.600 --> 12:13.279
- Six suitcases.
- And all matching.

12:13.280 --> 12:14.925
And a hatbox.

12:15.040 --> 12:17.368
Mayfair from head to foot.

12:17.440 --> 12:20.849
Can't think what she's doing
in a place like this.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.519
- Good evening.
- Mrs. Shankland?

12:35.520 --> 12:36.839
Yes, that's right.

12:36.840 --> 12:41.204
Good evening. I have your reservation.
Will you sign there, please?

12:42.200 --> 12:45.802
- My American address or my English?
- English, please.

12:46.960 --> 12:50.721
Can you tell me if Mr. Malcolm
is in? Mr. John Malcolm?

12:51.840 --> 12:55.479
He's out at present. He'll be in for
dinner. Was he expecting you?

12:55.480 --> 12:58.206
No, I'd like to surprise him.

12:59.200 --> 13:02.085
Well, I won't say a word. Edgar?

13:03.960 --> 13:05.319
How long will you be staying?

13:05.320 --> 13:08.159
I'm not quite certain as yet.

13:08.160 --> 13:12.081
- Could I let you know later on?
- Yes, of course. Number 12.

13:12.240 --> 13:15.410
I'll book you in just for tonight.

13:16.600 --> 13:19.565
Dinner is at 7:00.
You'll hear the gong.

13:21.480 --> 13:24.445
- Edgar will show you to your room.
- Thank you.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.679
- You're the new one, aren't you?
- Yes.

14:43.680 --> 14:46.121
- You're over there.
- Thank you.

15:12.320 --> 15:13.479
Hello, Miss Cooper.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.839
Major, dinner's nearly over.
Aren't you going in?

15:15.840 --> 15:17.041
No.

15:18.320 --> 15:20.639
I'm so late, I think
I'll give it a miss.

15:20.640 --> 15:23.679
- Everything all right?
- Fine, everything's on the top line.

15:23.680 --> 15:28.283
I got to thinking about those memoirs.
Time rather ran away, I'm afraid.

15:31.480 --> 15:34.079
I found one or two
portable typewriters.

15:34.080 --> 15:35.406
Good.

15:37.320 --> 15:41.079
I don't suppose the West Hampshire
Weekly News is much read, is it?

15:41.080 --> 15:44.250
What? Mrs. Railton-Bell
takes it every week.

15:44.960 --> 15:47.479
Does she? Whatever for?

15:47.480 --> 15:49.599
There's not a lot
goes on in the world,

15:49.600 --> 15:52.879
even in West Hampshire,
that she cares to miss.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.879
And she can afford fourpence
for the information.

15:55.880 --> 15:56.959
I suppose so.

15:56.960 --> 15:59.959
Funny, I've never seen
her reading it. Have you?

15:59.960 --> 16:02.759
There's a lot of stuff she has
sent in she doesn't read.

16:02.760 --> 16:05.406
Most of it she leaves
on this table.

16:05.480 --> 16:07.559
You mean, her copy's
been here all the time?

16:07.560 --> 16:11.399
No, Major, that'll be sent
up with the evening papers.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.559
Well, dash it all.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.639
I've wasted fourpence for nothing.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.799
I mean, I could have borrowed hers.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.879
Sorry, mustn't keep you gossiping.

16:18.880 --> 16:21.719
Well, thanks again. Cheery-bye.

16:21.720 --> 16:23.081
Major.

16:33.400 --> 16:36.919
- I thought we were going upstairs.
- We've just finished dinner.

16:36.920 --> 16:39.439
I don't see what that
has to do with it.

16:39.440 --> 16:41.079
This is more important, dear.

16:41.080 --> 16:43.567
That's a terrible thing to say.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.159
There, now.

16:54.160 --> 16:56.839
Wipe the lipstick off.
The old girls might notice.

16:56.840 --> 16:58.879
Even the old girls know
the facts of life.

16:58.880 --> 17:01.686
They may know them,
but they don't like them.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.118
If you would only marry me,

17:05.119 --> 17:07.118
we wouldn't have to worry
about the old girls.

17:07.119 --> 17:09.279
We wouldn't have to
worry about anything.

17:09.280 --> 17:12.319
We could lead a nice,
normal, peaceful existence.

17:12.319 --> 17:13.839
Damn, here they come.

17:13.839 --> 17:16.646
Not so much the pork
as the stuffing.

17:23.079 --> 17:24.611
Excuse me.

17:26.119 --> 17:27.810
Good evening.

17:38.560 --> 17:42.162
Look at them. There's your
normal, peaceful existence.

17:42.360 --> 17:43.925
Darling.

17:44.040 --> 17:47.319
Conventions and marriage.
I don't want to end up like them.

17:47.320 --> 17:49.727
Will you shut up? They'll hear you.

17:51.960 --> 17:53.559
I've figured it all out.

17:53.560 --> 17:55.839
Life isn't meant to be
dreary, but exciting...

17:55.840 --> 17:57.690
Will you shut up?

18:12.840 --> 18:14.087
Bed.

18:15.200 --> 18:17.999
I'm on the trickiest duct
in the whole human body.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.119
Now, please.

18:19.120 --> 18:20.367
Bed.

18:28.080 --> 18:29.520
Come on.

18:45.960 --> 18:47.400
Good night, ladies.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.009
Good night. Sleep tight.

18:53.720 --> 18:56.651
Surely, a somewhat unnecessary
remark, Gladys dear.

18:57.040 --> 19:01.079
They're old friends. They're
just here to study.

19:01.080 --> 19:02.799
That's what they told Miss Cooper.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.279
I think it most unwise of
her to have them here.

19:05.280 --> 19:08.086
Even at opposite ends
of the corridor.

19:08.640 --> 19:11.719
- Quite obvious they were making love.
- How do you know?

19:11.720 --> 19:14.924
He was putting a handkerchief
away with lipstick on it.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.729
Well, perhaps they are in love.

19:18.760 --> 19:22.043
Why don't they say so?
I hate anything furtive.

19:22.160 --> 19:24.727
Now, what were we talking about?

19:25.080 --> 19:26.805
Good gracious.

19:26.880 --> 19:29.560
Please shut that door,
there's a most terrible draft.

19:29.561 --> 19:33.481
A draft? Bless my soul,
so there jolly well is.

19:34.920 --> 19:37.566
- He's so amusing.
- He's drunk.

19:39.160 --> 19:41.839
A brilliant observation,
Mrs. Railton-Bell.

19:41.840 --> 19:43.719
I'm sure she didn't mean...

19:43.720 --> 19:46.359
Lady Matheson. It's nice to
have a champion, thank you.

19:46.360 --> 19:48.881
But she's right. Irish Whiskey.

19:49.720 --> 19:52.321
Hello, Sibyl, how are
you this evening?

19:52.360 --> 19:55.279
Without the Irish Whiskey,
I'd not have broken my record.

19:55.280 --> 19:59.599
I made it back here from the Feathers
bar in six minutes flat instead of ten.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.079
I had the wind at my back.

20:01.080 --> 20:03.999
But as you and I know,
Mrs. Railton-Bell, we cannot deny

20:04.000 --> 20:06.159
the propulsive powers
of Irish Whiskey.

20:06.160 --> 20:07.479
Scotch, on the other hand...

20:07.480 --> 20:10.650
Mr. Malcolm, did you come in
through the French windows?

20:10.720 --> 20:13.207
Miss Cooper, I cannot tell a lie.

20:14.080 --> 20:17.329
You know that is strictly
forbidden after 7:00.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.359
I'm sorry, I'd forgotten.

20:19.360 --> 20:21.519
There's mud all over the floor.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.439
Please hang this in
the proper place.

20:23.440 --> 20:24.559
Yes, ma'am.

20:24.560 --> 20:27.959
Also, wipe your feet on the mat
provided for that purpose.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.525
Yes, ma'am.

20:31.680 --> 20:34.359
I'm so sorry. I shall see
this doesn't happen again.

20:34.360 --> 20:36.599
I must say, quite
frankly, Miss Cooper,

20:36.600 --> 20:40.039
I've never understood how you
could tolerate such boorishness,

20:40.040 --> 20:42.159
and have done all this time.

20:42.160 --> 20:45.199
In a hotel, one must tolerate
all sorts of things.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.479
I suppose so.

20:46.480 --> 20:50.319
But one hardly expects to find that
kind of person in this kind of hotel.

20:50.320 --> 20:53.879
Why he should have selected the
Beauregard as a permanent residence

20:53.880 --> 20:55.319
is quite beyond me.

20:55.320 --> 20:58.922
He was stationed near here
during the war, I believe.

20:59.080 --> 21:01.328
He used to stay here then.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.799
He writes very nicely.

21:04.800 --> 21:08.679
I read an article of his once. Just
out of curiosity. It was about labor.

21:08.680 --> 21:09.959
Have you ever read...

21:09.960 --> 21:13.209
I have no curiosity about
the working classes.

21:21.920 --> 21:24.009
How many have you had?

21:24.200 --> 21:26.129
Two. Well, three.

21:26.360 --> 21:28.847
Definitely not more than four.

21:29.480 --> 21:32.206
I'm sorry, Pat. I know I shouldn't.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.680
You know that I love you,
don't you? Very sincerely.

21:37.440 --> 21:39.919
That sounds like what a
brother says to a sister.

21:39.920 --> 21:43.039
Sister? You know my feelings
for you go beyond that.

21:43.040 --> 21:45.159
Just how far beyond, John?

21:45.160 --> 21:48.239
Well, I had a dim recollection
we were engaged, or hadn't I?

21:48.240 --> 21:50.363
I rather wondered if you had.

21:52.440 --> 21:55.079
- What's the matter?
- I don't know what you mean.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.560
Come on, now,
something's the matter.

21:57.120 --> 22:01.599
After all, most women feel rather
odd about a proposal of marriage,

22:01.600 --> 22:06.199
especially if they hear it once rather late
at night and the man has had a few drinks.

22:06.200 --> 22:09.609
- We'll announce it publicly, right now.
- No, John.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.039
- What?
- There's someone...

22:12.040 --> 22:13.287
Yes?

22:14.040 --> 22:17.767
Despite the hour and the
drink, you did mean it?

22:26.960 --> 22:29.279
Have dinner. I told cook
to keep you something hot.

22:29.280 --> 22:30.759
Let's walk to the beach.

22:30.760 --> 22:35.119
- Darling, I can't. I've got to close up...
- Let's walk down to the beach tonight.

22:35.120 --> 22:38.130
Ask me again when
you've had your coffee.

22:47.840 --> 22:49.485
Miss Meacham.

23:07.040 --> 23:09.971
You in, at last? Thank heavens.

23:10.240 --> 23:13.523
The park's off, and the
goulash is drying out,

23:13.760 --> 23:15.879
but we kept you some soup.

23:15.880 --> 23:20.529
What a pity young Ridgewell wasn't here.
He'd have enjoyed the turnover.

23:21.160 --> 23:24.599
The cook's acquiring a lighter touch
with her pastry, don't you think?

23:24.600 --> 23:27.439
Not judging by the tarts
we had at tea yesterday.

23:27.440 --> 23:30.371
Cannon balls. Simply cannon balls.

23:33.240 --> 23:37.047
Here we are, tuck into that
while I get the goulash.

23:37.720 --> 23:41.367
Not for what I wouldn't think
you'd had your liquid already.

23:52.240 --> 23:53.839
What are you doing here?

23:53.840 --> 23:55.166
Surprised?

23:55.560 --> 23:58.279
I gave up being surprised
by you five years ago.

23:58.280 --> 24:01.404
You gave up a lot of
things five years ago.

24:03.160 --> 24:05.199
Is this your year for
looking up old husbands?

24:05.200 --> 24:06.765
Only the special ones.

24:07.120 --> 24:10.119
I ran into some friends of
ours at a party in London.

24:10.120 --> 24:11.479
Friends of ours?

24:11.480 --> 24:13.284
All right, mine.

24:13.560 --> 24:16.519
They said you were having a rough
time getting along these days.

24:16.520 --> 24:19.359
That's why I'm here.
I wanted to help you.

24:19.360 --> 24:22.131
Well, that's really touching.
I'm overwhelmed.

24:23.960 --> 24:27.559
Goulash. Aren't you
going to eat your soup?

24:27.560 --> 24:29.922
I'll have two bowls tomorrow.

24:30.520 --> 24:32.609
Tomato aspic tomorrow.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.930
Don't take long, will you?
My friend's waiting.

24:45.320 --> 24:47.439
Now, is there anything else?

24:47.440 --> 24:50.479
You find it impossible to
believe I care about you.

24:50.480 --> 24:52.199
Not impossible, Ann,
just incredible.

24:52.200 --> 24:54.199
Call it selfish if you want.

24:54.200 --> 24:56.846
But I'd feel better if I could
make up in some way for the past.

24:57.400 --> 24:59.519
What is this, a bribe to
ease your conscience?

24:59.520 --> 25:01.529
Now look, John, I...

25:03.080 --> 25:06.759
I'm not saying who was right
or wrong over what happened.

25:06.760 --> 25:09.167
I'm only concerned
seeing you like this.

25:09.600 --> 25:12.485
You'll forget all about it by the
time you reach London tomorrow.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.965
- Tomorrow?
- You are leaving in the morning?

25:16.440 --> 25:18.879
Why yes, of course, if you like.

25:18.880 --> 25:21.128
Fine. That's settled then.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.927
What do you possibly do here?

25:31.440 --> 25:34.530
I enjoy one great luxury,
being left alone.

25:34.760 --> 25:38.487
Well, it's a quaint spot you've
picked out for yourself.

25:39.120 --> 25:42.039
Your last husband would have
done wonders with this place.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.079
Interior decorator, wasn't he?

25:44.080 --> 25:45.759
When he worked.

25:45.760 --> 25:47.839
How long were you married to him?

25:47.840 --> 25:49.639
Two years and six months.

25:49.640 --> 25:53.322
Beats us by three months.
Cruelty again, wasn't it?

25:53.760 --> 25:55.530
A legal device.

25:57.040 --> 26:00.159
You mean he didn't break down
the bedroom door to get at you?

26:00.160 --> 26:03.523
No. He didn't try
to kill me, either.

26:09.120 --> 26:11.519
I saw the headlines of the divorce.

26:11.520 --> 26:15.119
Educating, but not nearly so
sensational as ours, you'll admit.

26:15.120 --> 26:17.319
You were interested
enough to read about it?

26:17.320 --> 26:21.039
Reading worthless items is a bad
habit I picked up in prison.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.925
You see, there was nothing else to do.
My wife never came to see me.

26:24.480 --> 26:27.081
I only did what I thought
was best for you.

26:30.640 --> 26:34.811
You know something, Ann? No one I
know of lies with such sincerity.

26:37.840 --> 26:39.639
Now, if you'll excuse me.

26:39.640 --> 26:43.481
Do you know what I think?
I think you've found a new girl.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.119
The morning train leaves at 10:45.

26:47.120 --> 26:49.288
You must like her a lot.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.250
I do. I'm going to marry her.

26:53.520 --> 26:54.926
John,

26:56.600 --> 26:58.359
don't misunderstand.

26:58.360 --> 27:02.121
I think it's really wonderful
you've found someone else.

27:02.560 --> 27:04.199
I didn't mean any harm.

27:04.200 --> 27:05.640
That's when you do the most damage.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.639
- We all make mistakes.
- You specialize in them.

27:08.640 --> 27:10.679
Only little ones, though.

27:10.680 --> 27:14.399
I still have a scar on the side of my
head to remind me of one of yours.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.250
Five years should cure most scars.

27:17.600 --> 27:21.521
Most, I suppose. Not all, though.

27:24.400 --> 27:27.649
Well, I may not see
you in the morning.

27:28.800 --> 27:32.243
- Shall we say goodbye now?
- I think we've said it.

27:33.200 --> 27:36.131
I'm awfully glad to
see you again, John.

27:46.160 --> 27:48.362
What are you laughing at?

27:49.120 --> 27:53.291
That was an innocent kiss.
You have nothing I want.

27:53.440 --> 27:57.199
I'm happily engaged to be married, and
came to England to meet his family.

27:57.200 --> 27:59.319
He's everything I want in a man.

27:59.320 --> 28:02.524
He doesn't have to turn
a wild beast to prove it.

28:03.840 --> 28:06.008
Now you must feel as
foolish as you look.

28:25.240 --> 28:26.521
John.

30:08.200 --> 30:12.928
If you didn't want to see the program,
dear, you should have said so.

30:14.920 --> 30:16.879
Caught in the act, what?

30:16.880 --> 30:18.519
I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. R-B.

30:18.520 --> 30:21.839
There was something in the Evening
Standard I wanted to look at.

30:21.840 --> 30:23.929
I'm afraid I
appropriated your copy.

30:24.040 --> 30:26.119
Would you mind if I
borrowed it for a minute?

30:26.120 --> 30:28.239
That isn't the Evening
Standard, Major.

30:28.240 --> 30:29.319
It's what?

30:29.320 --> 30:32.285
No. It's the West
Hampshire Weekly News.

30:32.840 --> 30:37.443
I'm absolutely blithered.
What an astonishing thing.

30:37.800 --> 30:40.119
I must have pulled
out the wrong paper.

30:40.120 --> 30:44.039
Mea culpa. My fault. I can't
understand how I did that.

30:44.040 --> 30:45.890
Neither do I. There's
quite a difference.

30:46.080 --> 30:49.679
Yes. Indeed. The West Hampshire
News is hardly my cup of tea. What?

30:49.680 --> 30:53.279
Well, is it all right then, if I borrow
your Standard for a little while?

30:53.280 --> 30:54.399
If you return it.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.879
Jolly decent of you, Mrs. R-B.
Thank you so much.

30:56.880 --> 30:59.479
After that, I think I'll go
take a look at some telly.

30:59.480 --> 31:01.559
I understand there's a
new quiz program on.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.599
A small boy of nine
just won over £40.

31:03.600 --> 31:05.959
Yes, I hear he's very clever.

31:05.960 --> 31:08.731
- Shall I be seeing you in there?
- Yes.

31:10.600 --> 31:13.639
No, I'd forgotten.
I have to write a letter.

31:13.640 --> 31:17.083
I see. Well, cheery-bye, both.

31:20.880 --> 31:24.679
I wish he wouldn't use that revolting
expression. It's so common.

31:24.680 --> 31:27.559
Of course, he's such an
awfully common little man.

31:27.560 --> 31:29.999
No, Mummy. Do you think so?

31:30.000 --> 31:31.919
He was in a very good regiment.

31:31.920 --> 31:34.691
You can be in the Horse Guards,
dear, and still be common.

31:35.680 --> 31:37.439
I don't know what you see in him.

31:37.440 --> 31:41.679
It's just that I like all
his stories about the war

31:41.680 --> 31:44.199
and the desert and the regiment.

31:44.200 --> 31:47.165
He's seen so much of
life, and I haven't.

31:48.040 --> 31:51.359
I don't know what you mean
by that, dear, I'm sure.

31:51.360 --> 31:53.210
I only meant...

31:54.720 --> 31:56.524
I'm sorry, Mummy.

31:56.880 --> 32:01.039
I realize that you must occasionally miss
some of the little gaieties of life.

32:01.040 --> 32:02.839
Balls and cocktail parties

32:02.840 --> 32:06.039
and things that a few other
lucky young people can enjoy.

32:06.040 --> 32:07.519
I do my best, you know.

32:07.520 --> 32:08.839
I know you do, Mummy.

32:08.840 --> 32:12.999
There was Scotland last year, and our
Scandinavian cruise the year before.

32:13.000 --> 32:17.569
I know, Mummy. Please, don't
think that I'm not grateful.

32:18.240 --> 32:21.205
- It's only...
- Only what, dear?

32:23.040 --> 32:25.402
If only I could do something.

32:28.360 --> 32:32.319
Mummy, there's an advertisement in the
newspaper for a telephone operator.

32:32.320 --> 32:35.159
My dear, we've been
over this so often.

32:35.160 --> 32:38.204
You'd never stand it,
even for a few days.

32:38.480 --> 32:40.559
You remember Jones and Jones?

32:40.560 --> 32:45.039
Yes. But it was so stifling hot there
in the basement of Jones and Jones.

32:45.040 --> 32:47.971
This job in the
newspaper is different.

32:48.200 --> 32:52.559
Now, you're not a very strong child.
You must try and get that into your head.

32:52.560 --> 32:55.639
Your nervous system isn't nearly
as sound as it should be.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.679
You, mean my "states."

32:57.680 --> 33:00.399
But I haven't had one of
those for a long time.

33:00.400 --> 33:03.490
I know, dear. You've
been very good, indeed.

33:03.520 --> 33:06.959
But there's quite a difference
in not having an hysterical fit

33:06.960 --> 33:09.367
and being able to keep a job.

33:10.080 --> 33:13.966
Now, fetch me that
newspaper, will you, dear?

33:15.840 --> 33:17.405
Yes, Mummy.

33:18.080 --> 33:21.799
- Which one do you want?
- The West Hampshire Weekly News.

33:21.800 --> 33:25.159
I want to see what the Major
was so interested in.

33:25.160 --> 33:26.919
Dear, what a silly-billy.

33:26.920 --> 33:29.851
I've gone and left
my glasses upstairs.

33:30.160 --> 33:31.919
Shall I go and get them for you?

33:31.920 --> 33:34.399
Will you, dear? That
would be so kind of you.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.879
I hate you fetching
and carrying for me.

33:36.880 --> 33:39.439
But you know, my poor old
legs are a bit tired.

33:39.440 --> 33:41.839
I think you'll find them
on the table by my bed.

33:41.840 --> 33:43.451
Yes, Mummy.

34:05.880 --> 34:09.599
My dear, there's the most wonderful
quiz program on television.

34:09.600 --> 34:13.478
- There's a little boy...
- Gladys, have you got your glasses?

34:13.480 --> 34:17.199
- Yes, dear.
- Good. I idiotically left mine upstairs.

34:17.199 --> 34:19.447
Here, read this out to me.

34:21.719 --> 34:25.719
- "Cab driver loses license."
- No. "Ex-officer pleads guilty."

34:26.199 --> 34:30.199
"Ex-officer pleads guilty.
Offense in theater."

34:31.199 --> 34:34.599
- My dear, do we really want to read this?
- Yes, we do. Go on.

34:34.600 --> 34:38.964
- But what about the television?
- This is infinitely more important.

34:39.159 --> 34:42.079
"On Thursday last, before
the Bournemouth magistrate,

34:42.080 --> 34:46.159
"David Angus Pollock, 55, giving his
address as the Beauregard Hotel...

34:46.159 --> 34:49.045
"Morgan." Pollock?

34:50.159 --> 34:51.478
Major Pollock?

Go on.

34:53.920 --> 34:56.599
"Morgan Crescent, Bournemouth,

34:56.600 --> 35:00.247
"of insulting behavior in
a Bournemouth cinema."

35:00.760 --> 35:02.519
He must've been drinking.

35:02.520 --> 35:05.199
No. He only drinks one
glass of port a day.

35:05.200 --> 35:06.279
Go on.

35:06.280 --> 35:09.559
"A Mrs. Osborne, 43, of 4
Standard Road, giving evidence,

35:09.560 --> 35:14.199

take other liberties.

"There were no further complaints,
though not unusual in cases of this kind.

35:49.560 --> 35:52.809
"On leaving the theater,
Pollock was arrested."

35:55.720 --> 35:57.331
Is that all?

35:57.960 --> 36:02.159
Yes. "Mr. William Crowther, appearing
on behalf of the defendant,

36:02.160 --> 36:05.399

a momentary aberration.

36:05.400 --> 36:07.999
"He was extremely sorry
and ashamed of himself.

"And would undertake never to behave in
so stupid and improper a manner in future.

The whole of the war?

36:39.280 --> 36:41.687
Yes, dear. I heard you. Go on.

36:42.240 --> 36:46.968
"In 1946, he had been demobilized

37:04.640 --> 37:05.966

37:09.280 --> 37:11.679
He must have thought he'd
gotten away with it.

37:11.680 --> 37:14.439
What a stroke of luck
I take this paper.

37:14.440 --> 37:16.563
Luck? Was it luck?

37:17.280 --> 37:18.891
I almost...

37:20.040 --> 37:21.844
Dear, poor Sibyl.

37:21.960 --> 37:25.050
- Maud, you must not tell her.
- Not tell her?

37:25.720 --> 37:29.686
Not the details.
Not about the theater.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.679
I don't know how I shall ever
look him in the face again.

37:32.680 --> 37:34.119
You won't have to, dear.

37:34.120 --> 37:36.839
I'll insist to Miss Cooper
that he leave the hotel

37:36.840 --> 37:38.879
before luncheon time tomorrow.

37:38.880 --> 37:41.199
Maud, do you think you ought to?

37:41.200 --> 37:44.599
What's come over you this evening?
Of course I ought to.

37:44.600 --> 37:48.771
You know what Miss Cooper is.
She's so independent and stubborn.

37:48.880 --> 37:50.839
Perhaps she won't agree.

37:50.840 --> 37:54.522
- She'll have to if we all insist.
- We don't all insist.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.965
Well, I mean, there's
only the two of us.

37:58.320 --> 38:00.727
Should we consult the others?

38:01.000 --> 38:03.439
That means we shall
have to tell them.

38:03.440 --> 38:06.199
An excellent idea. Let's go
and get them all together.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.599
Sorry it took so long.
Here are your glasses.

38:08.600 --> 38:11.199
You found them, clever girl.
I don't need them now.

38:11.200 --> 38:14.210
Gladys, go and see who's
in the game room.

38:15.560 --> 38:19.319
Mrs. Shankland. We'd like you to
come to a meeting in the lounge.

38:19.320 --> 38:22.729
- But I...
- I'll tell you all about it in a moment.

38:27.720 --> 38:30.048
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

38:39.560 --> 38:41.079
Am I reading your magazine?

38:41.080 --> 38:43.965
No. You go right
ahead, Mrs. Shankland.

38:44.320 --> 38:47.319
I didn't expect to find a
fashion magazine here.

38:47.320 --> 38:50.967
- Does Miss Cooper take it?
- No. It's...

38:52.080 --> 38:53.879
It's yours, isn't it?

38:53.880 --> 38:55.127
Yes.

38:56.160 --> 38:58.959
You must forgive me
for staring at you,

38:58.960 --> 39:02.130
but you look so beautiful,
I really couldn't help it.

39:02.240 --> 39:03.799
Thank you very much.

39:03.800 --> 39:06.162
You look just like the
pictures in the magazine.

39:06.280 --> 39:09.439
But my picture hasn't been in
a magazine, not for years.

39:09.440 --> 39:11.239
But I remember them.

39:11.240 --> 39:16.319
And I've always wondered who you were,
and the exciting kind of life you led.

39:16.320 --> 39:19.159
You look just the same.
Just as lovely.

39:19.160 --> 39:22.079
Well, thank you. That's
very sweet of you.

39:22.080 --> 39:24.319
I recognized you the
moment that you came...

39:24.320 --> 39:25.559
Sibyl?

39:25.560 --> 39:27.569
Yes, Mummy. I'm here.

39:29.120 --> 39:31.759
Forgive me for staring at you.
It was very rude.

39:31.760 --> 39:36.284
Sibyl, dear. I think you had better
go to your room, if you don't mind.

39:36.960 --> 39:38.439
But why, Mummy?

39:38.440 --> 39:43.282
Because we're having a meeting in here
with some of the regular residents,

39:44.240 --> 39:47.171
to discuss a matter
of grave urgency

39:47.520 --> 39:49.279
which has just cropped up.

39:49.280 --> 39:53.479
How exciting. Can't I stay?
After all, I'm a regular, too.

39:53.480 --> 39:55.159
Yes, I know, dear.

39:55.160 --> 39:58.199
But I don't think the subject
is at all suitable for you.

39:58.200 --> 40:02.962
- If this is to be a meeting of the residents...
- No, please, Mrs. Shankland.

40:06.200 --> 40:09.999
Although you're temporary, we'd like
you to feel that you're one of us.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.399
And as a woman of the world,
we would value your advice.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.319
But what is it, Mummy?

40:15.320 --> 40:17.887
What an inquisitive child it is.

40:18.680 --> 40:22.327
Well, I'll tell you this much.
But only this much.

40:23.560 --> 40:27.560
It concerns your friend, the
Major, and it's extremely grave.

40:28.680 --> 40:30.999
But I don't understand.
What is it, Mummy?

40:31.000 --> 40:33.999
I'm not going to tell you more.
It might upset you too much.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.199
I must know, Mummy. I must...

40:36.200 --> 40:40.319
Please, don't raise your voice so, dear.
You really insist I should tell you?

40:40.320 --> 40:41.719
Yes, Mummy. I do.

40:41.720 --> 40:44.764
- Even after my strong warning?
- Yes, Mummy.

40:45.800 --> 40:48.321
Very well then, I've no option.

40:49.880 --> 40:54.005
Read that, middle column,
top of the page.

41:13.280 --> 41:15.209
I couldn't find...

41:16.560 --> 41:18.199
Maud, you haven't told her.

41:18.200 --> 41:21.847
I did my best, but she
absolutely insisted.

41:24.600 --> 41:27.759
My dear, I'm so sorry. Must
be a dreadful shock for you.

41:27.760 --> 41:31.043
It was for us, too.
Are you all right?

41:34.360 --> 41:36.562
Sibyl, are you all right?

41:36.920 --> 41:38.485
Yes, Mummy.

41:43.600 --> 41:46.280
Sibyl, you've broken my glasses.

41:47.800 --> 41:49.919
And you've cut your hand.

41:49.920 --> 41:51.929
Here, let me see it.

41:54.160 --> 41:56.359
I think you'd better
wrap this around it.

41:56.360 --> 41:59.439
It's only a scratch, that's
much too fine a handkerchief.

41:59.440 --> 42:02.325
That's all right.
I have another in my bag.

42:04.120 --> 42:06.119
Well now, shall we all sit down?

42:06.120 --> 42:08.639
Mr. Fowler, would you draw
up that chair, please?

42:08.640 --> 42:10.119
Where are the others?

42:10.120 --> 42:13.599
I couldn't find anyone else. Edgar's
gone to look for Mr. Malcolm.

42:13.600 --> 42:16.479
I shouldn't have bothered.
He always has so much to say.

42:16.480 --> 42:18.444
Now, let us all be seated.

42:34.800 --> 42:39.005
Who, it turns out, was only a
lieutenant in the Service Supply Depot

42:39.200 --> 42:41.559
and was arrested in the cinema.

42:41.560 --> 42:43.728
I can't believe it. Incredible.

42:43.800 --> 42:47.359
The question now becomes,
"What are we going to do about it?"

42:47.360 --> 42:51.804
The Major will be watching TV for a while,
and we don't want to be interrupted.

42:55.320 --> 42:58.959
I feel we should act firmly
and quickly to rid ourselves

42:58.960 --> 43:01.359
of this dangerous
person in our midst.

43:01.360 --> 43:06.009
I must admit, I always suspected
the public school education.

43:06.120 --> 43:10.439
Only this evening, he made a most
shocking mistake in quoting Horace.

43:10.440 --> 43:12.559
- Please.
- Quite appalling.

43:12.560 --> 43:15.839
Please, Mr. Fowler, we're
getting away from the subject.

43:15.840 --> 43:19.159
The ugly fact remains that
this fellow resident of ours

43:19.160 --> 43:21.479
was arrested and found guilty.

43:21.480 --> 43:22.999
Pleaded guilty.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.319
Please, Gladys.

43:24.320 --> 43:28.679
Found or pleaded guilty
to a disgusting offense.

43:28.680 --> 43:31.519
Which fellow resident?
What disgusting offense?

43:31.520 --> 43:34.371
I don't think this is a matter that
would interest you, Mr. Malcolm.

43:35.040 --> 43:37.199
It seems to interest
our newest resident.

43:37.200 --> 43:40.159
I don't see why it shouldn't
interest one of our oldest.

43:40.160 --> 43:44.039
Very well. If you must know, Major
Pollock has behaved immorally

43:44.040 --> 43:48.245
to no less than six respectable
women in a local cinema.

43:49.040 --> 43:52.722
Six? Well, that's
quite a performance.

43:54.840 --> 43:57.999
Really, Maud, on behalf of
the Major, I must remind you

43:58.000 --> 44:02.489
we only know that one was respectable,
the one who made the complaint.

44:02.680 --> 44:07.159
And even she behaved very oddly. Why
didn't she say right out to the Major,

44:07.160 --> 44:10.879
"Will you please stop doing
whatever it is you are doing?"

44:10.880 --> 44:13.279
That's what I would have done.

44:13.280 --> 44:16.199
And we don't know anything
about the others.

44:16.200 --> 44:19.563
We don't even know that he
nudged them or anything.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.519
Of course he nudged them.

44:21.520 --> 44:24.359
He was in that cinema
for an immoral purpose.

44:24.360 --> 44:25.879
He admitted it.

44:25.880 --> 44:29.039
And he was seen to change his
seat no less than five times

44:29.040 --> 44:32.039
always choosing one next
to a female person.

44:32.040 --> 44:35.119
Let's see. That would make
10 nudges, wouldn't it?

44:35.120 --> 44:39.039
If he used both elbows. No, 11 with
the original one. Or 12 supposing...

44:39.040 --> 44:43.609
I consider this flippancy, on a matter
so serious, as utterly monstrous.

44:43.840 --> 44:46.399
You're right, it is serious
for the poor Major.

44:46.400 --> 44:49.399
What are you proposing?
Have him thrown out of the hotel?

44:49.400 --> 44:52.239
I'm proposing to ask the opinion
of the other residents.

44:52.240 --> 44:54.799
I plainly have no
need to ask yours.

44:54.800 --> 44:57.119
I don't know why you say that.

44:57.120 --> 44:59.639
I feel repelled by
what the Major's done.

44:59.640 --> 45:02.799
I've always had an intense
dislike for, shall we say,

45:02.800 --> 45:05.359
the more furtive forms
of sexual expression.

45:05.360 --> 45:08.119
I think it's only fair to ask
ourselves this question,

45:08.120 --> 45:09.959
what harm has the man done?

45:09.960 --> 45:12.839
Apart from bruising the
elbow of a certain lady

45:12.840 --> 45:16.119
whose motives in complaining,
I agree with Lady Matheson,

45:16.120 --> 45:17.799
are extremely questionable.

45:17.800 --> 45:22.722
Apart from that and telling us a few
rather pathetic lies about his past life,

45:22.840 --> 45:25.199
which most of us do from
time to time anyway,

45:25.200 --> 45:28.679
I can't see what he's done to justify
being thrown into the street.

45:28.680 --> 45:31.959
Then it's obvious you're
against any action at all.

45:31.960 --> 45:34.719
Well, I might give him a
cool glance at dinner.

45:34.720 --> 45:36.759
I think your attitude is shocking.

45:36.760 --> 45:38.007
Do you? Why?

45:38.080 --> 45:41.887
What's he done that's worse than
people who cheapen lovemaking,

45:42.000 --> 45:44.328
who use it as a weapon
to get what they want?

45:45.320 --> 45:49.119
No, Mrs. Railton-Bell, I'm sure
there are people in this very room,

45:49.120 --> 45:51.879
who have done their fellow man
more harm than the Major.

45:51.880 --> 45:53.570
I don't agree.

45:56.720 --> 45:59.799
I'm sorry. Just forget
I said anything.

45:59.800 --> 46:02.559
That's quite all
right, Mrs. Shankland.

46:02.560 --> 46:05.445
I'm sure that anything that you have
to say will be right to the point.

46:06.360 --> 46:07.879
It wouldn't be fair.

46:07.880 --> 46:12.051
I don't even know the Major.
We are talking about the Major?

46:12.080 --> 46:13.639
We are indeed.

46:13.640 --> 46:17.159
Now that we've heard your views
on the subject, Mr. Malcolm,

46:17.160 --> 46:20.519
odd, distasteful and dangerous
though they may be,

46:20.520 --> 46:22.802
it's time we heard from
the others. Mr. Fowler?

46:24.400 --> 46:27.439
Well, it's very difficult.

46:27.440 --> 46:29.479
I don't see what's
difficult about it.

46:29.480 --> 46:33.969
But it is, you know. I can't say
that I see it like Malcolm.

46:35.400 --> 46:39.039
Certain acts are wrong because
they are, in themselves

46:39.040 --> 46:41.891
and by themselves,
impure and immoral.

46:43.160 --> 46:47.999
It seems to me that this terrible
wave of vice and sexual excess

46:48.000 --> 46:50.759
which has been flooding
the world since the war

46:50.760 --> 46:54.760
might in part be due to the
decline of the old standards.

46:55.480 --> 47:00.527
Tolerance is not necessarily a good.
Tolerance of evil can itself be an evil.

47:00.600 --> 47:02.959
After all, wasn't it
Aristotle who said...

47:02.960 --> 47:07.643
Really, you've all gone
on far too long about it.

47:07.760 --> 47:12.079
And when you start quoting Aristotle,
personally, I'm going to me room.

47:12.080 --> 47:13.599
You heard, Miss Meacham?

47:13.600 --> 47:16.399
I couldn't help hearing.
I didn't want to.

47:16.400 --> 47:18.839
I was doing me betting system.

47:18.840 --> 47:22.044
You need to concentrate
like billyo on that.

47:22.280 --> 47:25.439
I had my chair against the
wall to catch the light.

47:25.440 --> 47:29.279
I certainly wasn't going to get
eyestrain just for you people.

47:29.280 --> 47:32.599
As you know the facts, perhaps
we'd better canvass your opinion.

47:32.600 --> 47:34.962
I haven't any. Why should I?

47:35.200 --> 47:38.927
I've been out of the world far
longer than any of you...

47:39.040 --> 47:41.971
And what do I know of
morals and ethics?

47:42.040 --> 47:45.319
Only what I read in novels,
and as I only read thrillers,

47:45.320 --> 47:47.439
that doesn't amount to much.

47:47.440 --> 47:52.399
In Mickey Spillane, the hero does far worse
things to his girls than the Major's done

47:52.400 --> 47:54.239
and no one seems to mind.

47:54.240 --> 47:55.719
It's hardly to the point

47:55.720 --> 47:59.481
what Mr. Spillane's heroes do
to his girls, Miss Meacham.

47:59.640 --> 48:02.002
We want your views
on Major Pollock.

48:02.480 --> 48:03.886
Do you?

48:04.840 --> 48:09.568
My views on Major Pollock have always
been that he's a crashing old bore

48:09.760 --> 48:11.849
and a wicked old fraud.

48:12.320 --> 48:16.445
Now I hear he's a dirty old man,
too, I'm not at all surprised.

48:17.320 --> 48:22.003
And quite between these four
walls, I don't give a damn.

48:27.720 --> 48:30.048
Sad. Very sad.

48:30.840 --> 48:33.964
Well, Mr. Fowler, I take it you
are on the side of action?

48:35.920 --> 48:39.044
I once had to recommend
a boy for expulsion.

48:39.360 --> 48:43.319
Only once, in all the 15
years I was a housemaster.

48:43.320 --> 48:46.251
Are you in favor of
action, Mr. Fowler?

48:48.320 --> 48:51.126
Yes, I suppose so.

48:52.360 --> 48:54.130
Yes, I am.

48:54.200 --> 48:55.561
Gladys?

48:56.320 --> 48:57.599
Oh, dear.

48:57.600 --> 49:00.079
There you go, shilly-shallying
again, Gladys.

49:00.080 --> 49:01.479
Make up your mind.

49:01.480 --> 49:04.239
Are you with Mr. Malcolm
and his defense of vice,

49:04.240 --> 49:09.241
or on the side of the Christian
virtues, like Mr. Fowler and myself?

49:09.520 --> 49:13.725
Never in my life have I heard a
question so disgracefully begged.

49:13.960 --> 49:16.319
You should be in politics,
Mrs. Railton-Bell.

49:16.320 --> 49:17.726
Gladys?

49:18.720 --> 49:22.925
Of course I am on your side,
dear. It's only that...

49:23.000 --> 49:27.000
Mr. Malcolm, apart from Miss
Meacham and Mrs. Shankland,

49:27.040 --> 49:30.767
who may be counted as neutral,
the count is four-to-one against you.

49:33.880 --> 49:36.319
Shall we all go and see
Miss Cooper in a body

49:36.320 --> 49:39.763
or would you rather that I
acted as your spokesman?

49:40.280 --> 49:42.479
I think perhaps,
dear, if you went...

49:42.480 --> 49:44.839
Yes. Perhaps that would be best.

49:44.840 --> 49:46.280
Well,

49:47.080 --> 49:49.408
it's a duty I hardly relish.

49:50.240 --> 49:54.331
Just a moment, Mrs. Railton-Bell.
We haven't heard from your daughter.

49:54.840 --> 49:58.079
My daughter agrees with me.
I know her feelings on the subject.

49:58.080 --> 50:00.919
I think she should be permitted
to speak for herself.

50:00.920 --> 50:03.361
Sibyl, can we have your views?

50:04.400 --> 50:08.366
- Mr. Malcolm is speaking to you, dear.
- Yes, Mummy.

50:08.760 --> 50:10.849
Can we have your views?

50:11.440 --> 50:12.799
MY views?

50:12.800 --> 50:14.679
On Major Pollock, dear.

50:14.680 --> 50:17.486
What action should
we take about him?

50:19.680 --> 50:21.450
It's the shock.

50:21.880 --> 50:24.731
You know what you've just
read in the paper, dear.

50:24.800 --> 50:27.048
What do you feel about it?

50:28.120 --> 50:29.639
It made me sick.

50:29.640 --> 50:31.959
Of course it did.
That's how we all feel.

50:31.960 --> 50:33.764
It made me sick.

50:33.800 --> 50:36.279
It made me sick!

50:36.280 --> 50:39.439
Stop that, Sibyl. Now, darling...

50:39.440 --> 50:42.719
- it made me sick. I don't feel well.
- Of course you don't, dear.

50:42.720 --> 50:44.319
It made me sick.

50:44.320 --> 50:48.047
Come, we'll go up to
our room and lie down.

50:50.960 --> 50:52.479
Is she often like that?

50:52.480 --> 50:55.889
No, not often. But
sometimes, I'm afraid.

50:56.800 --> 50:59.765
Her mother ought to
never have told her.

51:00.840 --> 51:03.159
I'm surprised at you, Mr. Malcolm.

51:03.160 --> 51:06.079
You ought not to have
brought her into it.

51:06.080 --> 51:07.770
I suppose not.

51:08.480 --> 51:11.639
I thought I might get her,
once in the whole of her life

51:11.640 --> 51:14.491
to publicly disagree
with her mother.

51:15.280 --> 51:17.608
It could save her
soul if she ever did.

51:24.880 --> 51:27.606
Poor child. The whole
affair is too dreadful.

51:28.520 --> 51:30.719
It's made me quite miserable.

51:30.720 --> 51:34.359
Yes. The trouble about
being on the side of right

51:34.360 --> 51:37.559
as one sees it, is that
one often finds oneself

51:37.560 --> 51:40.889
in the company of such
very questionable allies.

51:43.320 --> 51:45.719
There's nothing to be
done about it now.

51:45.720 --> 51:49.239
Your young friend Mr. Ridgewell,
he never telephoned?

51:49.240 --> 51:51.159
He could still turn up.

51:51.160 --> 51:53.959
I can hear the front
doorbell, you know.

51:53.960 --> 51:57.881
And, of course, with all this,
I won't get a wink of sleep.

51:58.800 --> 52:01.606
I wish he'd taken the
trouble to call.

52:37.080 --> 52:40.329
You're making it a bit
too obvious, you know,

52:41.360 --> 52:44.086
that you hate the very sight of me.

52:44.480 --> 52:48.844
The very sight of you, Ann, is perhaps
the one thing about you I don't hate.

52:50.640 --> 52:53.525
Please, John, don't
be so ill-mannered.

52:55.080 --> 52:58.250
All this fencing is a
bit idiotic, isn't it?

52:58.600 --> 53:00.759
I am leaving in the morning.

53:00.760 --> 53:03.919
And I wouldn't be here if I'd known
you were going to be married.

53:03.920 --> 53:05.879
Credit me with some degree of tact.

53:05.880 --> 53:10.290
I do. You were always very tactful,
especially about my bad manners.

53:11.320 --> 53:13.559
I never mentioned your manners.

53:13.560 --> 53:16.843
Incidentally, if you
disliked me so intensely,

53:16.880 --> 53:18.640
why did you ever marry
me in the first place?

53:21.680 --> 53:24.239
Do you want it reaffirmed
after all these years?

53:24.240 --> 53:26.479
Does your vanity need it that much?

53:26.480 --> 53:28.523
I wanted you desperately.

53:28.640 --> 53:31.279
I craved you so violently that
I could deny you nothing.

53:31.280 --> 53:34.239
Not even a marriage that was
bound to end in disaster.

53:34.240 --> 53:35.519
Why disaster?

53:35.520 --> 53:39.479
Ann, it's a long way from a Pennsylvania
steel town to Upper Park Avenue.

53:39.480 --> 53:42.599
Class distinction? You always
claimed it never existed.

53:42.600 --> 53:44.119
Until I married you.

53:44.120 --> 53:46.719
Then I really found
out how wrong I was.

53:46.720 --> 53:50.279
My ideas of a wife were influenced by
watching my mother ruin her health,

53:50.280 --> 53:51.919
to bring up eight kids.

53:51.920 --> 53:54.879
My demands on you wouldn't
have been that high

53:54.880 --> 53:58.199
but would've included properly
running a home and bearing children.

53:58.200 --> 54:00.639
About children, I did make
it perfectly clear...

54:00.640 --> 54:04.119
I know. The beautiful fashion model.
That little hobby of yours.

54:04.120 --> 54:07.244
Your figure was too important
to risk for posterity.

54:07.400 --> 54:09.239
I accepted the deal.
I've no complaints.

54:09.240 --> 54:11.249
But you know you have, John.

54:11.320 --> 54:14.639
The same complaint as always, that
I didn't love you when we married.

54:14.640 --> 54:16.839
Please. Let's not go into that.

54:16.840 --> 54:20.328
Why would I have married
you, if I didn't love you?

54:20.520 --> 54:23.883
After all, there were others.
More important men.

54:24.360 --> 54:26.359
They couldn't pay
you the full price.

54:26.360 --> 54:27.479
What price?

54:27.480 --> 54:29.045
Enslavement.

54:31.160 --> 54:33.931
John, really. How
ridiculous you are.

54:34.360 --> 54:37.199
If all I wanted to do was
to make my husband a slave,

54:37.200 --> 54:39.528
why would I have chosen
you and not the others?

54:40.560 --> 54:44.810
Because where would the fun have
been, enslaving men like that?

54:44.920 --> 54:47.479
A tame millionaire.
A mincing baronet.

54:47.480 --> 54:50.639
Too polite to say anything when
denied their conjugal rights.

54:50.640 --> 54:53.039
Too polite not to take
your headaches at bedtime

54:53.040 --> 54:54.799
as just headaches at bedtime.

54:54.800 --> 54:58.721
Where would the fun have been, turning
your weapons on men like that?

55:00.120 --> 55:03.199
No, Ann, you were reaching
into another class.

55:03.200 --> 55:05.801
You were looking for wilder game.

55:06.040 --> 55:08.959
Remember how you introduced
me to your friends?

55:08.960 --> 55:11.039
"My wild roaring savage"?

55:11.040 --> 55:13.359
That was always good for a laugh.

55:13.360 --> 55:17.039
To turn your weapons on him,
to make him sit up and beg

55:17.040 --> 55:19.479
at the whispered promise
of what was his by right.

55:19.480 --> 55:21.399
To goad him to such a rage

55:21.400 --> 55:24.399
that he'd kick open your bedroom
door and nearly kill you.

55:24.400 --> 55:26.967
That really must have been fun.

55:36.960 --> 55:38.810
Forgive me, Ann.

55:39.200 --> 55:42.722
I don't get many chances at
speechmaking these days.

55:42.960 --> 55:46.323
Besides, I'm a little
drunker than usual tonight.

55:46.800 --> 55:49.207
Because of seeing me?

55:51.120 --> 55:52.446
Yes.

55:52.600 --> 55:54.131
I'm sorry.

55:54.720 --> 55:56.331
No, you're not.

55:56.960 --> 55:58.759
You haven't changed much.

55:58.760 --> 56:00.325
Haven't I?

56:00.720 --> 56:04.599
The same old John, pouring out
the same old cascade of truths,

56:04.600 --> 56:06.370
half-truths and distortions.

56:07.080 --> 56:10.443
Human nature isn't as simple
as you make it, John.

56:10.840 --> 56:14.010
You left out the most
important fact of all.

56:14.120 --> 56:18.928
You see, you're the only person in the
world I've ever really been fond of.

56:21.760 --> 56:24.440
Notice how tactfully I
leave out the word "love."

56:28.920 --> 56:30.690
Give me a cigarette.

56:38.400 --> 56:41.922
No, not those awful cheap things.

56:42.840 --> 56:44.610
Hand me my bag.

56:50.640 --> 56:52.604
Do you dispute that?

56:53.560 --> 56:56.366
Your fondness for me was sometimes
shown in surprising ways.

57:05.680 --> 57:07.639
Why are you staring at me?

57:07.640 --> 57:09.968
You know perfectly well why.

57:11.200 --> 57:14.210
Well, don't. It makes
me embarrassed.

57:26.280 --> 57:29.199
You really think I
haven't changed much?

57:29.200 --> 57:30.919
To look at, I mean?

57:30.920 --> 57:32.485
Not at all.

57:33.560 --> 57:35.519
Just the clever makeup, I expect.

57:35.520 --> 57:37.159
I don't think so.

57:37.160 --> 57:41.639
I still think you're the most beautiful,
most desirable woman I've ever known.

57:41.640 --> 57:44.320
John, I really think you mean that.

57:46.800 --> 57:48.365
You know,

57:48.720 --> 57:52.199
some of the things you said might
happen to me are happening.

57:52.200 --> 57:53.640
Such as?

57:54.240 --> 57:55.759
Loneliness, for one.

57:55.760 --> 57:59.851
- No friends?
- Not many. I haven't the gift.

58:00.920 --> 58:03.043
What about your fiancé?

58:03.320 --> 58:05.249
You really think I'm
in love with him?

58:06.560 --> 58:08.842
It's always been you, John.

58:08.880 --> 58:10.650
All these years.

58:11.480 --> 58:14.684
It's so wonderful seeing
you again like this.

58:16.560 --> 58:18.967
I'm only sorry it's too late.

58:20.960 --> 58:24.767
If only I could just
stay on a little while.

58:26.920 --> 58:28.963
I won't be a nuisance.

58:31.120 --> 58:33.129
Really I won't, John.

58:47.280 --> 58:49.130
Darling, please.

58:49.200 --> 58:51.323
This is a public place.

58:51.520 --> 58:54.291
Anyone might come
out at any moment.

58:58.200 --> 59:01.961
There's no one here for it to
make any difference to me.

59:02.960 --> 59:05.288
I was just thinking of you.

59:14.680 --> 59:19.010
Miss Cooper has given me what
appears to be a very isolated room,

59:19.120 --> 59:21.402
the number of which is 12.

59:23.440 --> 59:25.005
Shall we go?

59:38.880 --> 59:41.082
How do I look? All right?

59:41.160 --> 59:42.439
All right.

59:42.440 --> 59:44.839
Mrs. Shankland, you're
wanted on the telephone.

59:44.840 --> 59:47.008
It's a call from London.

59:47.080 --> 59:48.611
Thank you.

59:49.000 --> 59:53.285
- You know where the telephone is?
- Yes, I do. Thank you very much.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:27.081
You knew who she was, didn't you?

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:29.041
Yes.

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.488
I must say, she's exactly
as you described her to me.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:37.399
"Carved in ice," you once said.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.761
Did I?

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:43.004
So that's the woman who
smashed up your life.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.519
She didn't, Pat.
I smashed up my own life.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:52.439
- If I hadn't been the sort of man I am...
- I know the sort of man you are.

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:54.679
And the sort of woman she is.

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:58.726
- In all the years I've known you...
- You don't know me at all.

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:03.084
I'm sorry, Pat,

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:07.971
but blaming her isn't
going to help.

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:10.321
I see.

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.959
I always knew in my heart you
were still in love with her.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.970
- Pat...
- Don't say anything.

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:21.008
I've known it all along.

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.164
Will you be going away with her?

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:29.641
I don't know. I don't know
anything about the future.

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.083
Yes, I expect you will.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:36.004
She looks as if she's got
some willpower, that girl.

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:40.239
If she's taken the trouble to run you to
earth down here, she won't let go easily.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:44.331
She didn't run me to earth, Pat.
She came down here to help me.

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:46.239
You really believe that?

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:49.205
She was going to be married.
Her fiance is in London.

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:52.131
- And she came here to help you?
- Yes.

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:56.366
It doesn't strike you as strange?

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:00.566
All right, let's leave it at that.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:03.159
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.559
- Tell me.
- No.

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:08.279
- What is it? Tell me.
- Don't knock me about. I'm not her.

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:10.479
Now I'll ask you a question.

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.639
- Does she know about us?
- No.

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.319
You're sure of that?

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.799
I told her I was engaged,
but I didn't say to whom.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.119
The only one who'd know about us
is your publisher, David Wilder.

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:21.559
That's right.

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:24.969
She's talking to Mr. Wilder
on the telephone now.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.799
- John, listen.
- It's all right. I want to talk to her.

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:33.367
- Please.
- I've got to talk to her.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:46.211
Miss Cooper, I've
been waiting for you.

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:49.919
It's a matter of vital importance.
I can't go into it here.

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:51.919
- I ask you to read this.
- Very well.

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:55.199
I may add that I've taken a
consensus of the residents.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:58.279
We are virtually unanimous

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:01.159
that the gentleman in
question be asked to leave

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.885
before lunchtime tomorrow.

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:21.160
Come in.

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:26.167
I'll just be a minute, darling.

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:36.125
Goodness, you didn't
give me much time.

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:37.965
I can wait.

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:41.599
There's some brandy on the
bureau, if you'd like.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:44.770
But I really don't think
you should, do you?

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:47.919
No.

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:49.770
That's a good boy.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:03.445
Darling John.

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:06.924
Listen. You can hear
the waves rolling in.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.811
Just like that hotel
in East Hampton.

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.761
Like that first summer we met.

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:18.328
A little big perhaps,
a little grand.

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:24.363
But we could make
believe, couldn't we?

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:31.001
We could wipe out everything
that's happened to us since.

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.971
The waves rolling
in all night long.

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.646
Remember?

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.159
That completes it, doesn't it?

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.319
What?

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:51.919
The stage is all set,
just like it was that night.

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:54.009
But I don't understand.

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:58.879
- Are you afraid of the light?
- Why should I be afraid of the light?

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:01.359
People who hate the light
usually hate the truth.

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:05.079
The truth? John, forgive me, but I
don't know what you're talking about.

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.919
I'm talking about liars, Ann.

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:09.479
- Liars and expensive tramps!
- What are you trying...

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:11.279
What did you say to Wilder?

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.879
That you saved dear old John from
a grubby little hotelkeeper?

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:17.479
Ten minutes flat and
he was at your feet.

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.999
His hands were too shaky
to light your cigarette.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.479
Please don't be angry with me.
I had to see you.

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:25.919
- I was desperate to see you.
- What for?

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:28.679
To help me? You wouldn't think
of telling me the truth.

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:32.199
No. You had to have your conquest,
your unconditional surrender.

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:34.079
If you could do it by lying...

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:38.046
All right. I knew you were
going to get married.

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:41.359
And I should have said so
from the beginning, but.

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.166
- I still have some pride left.
- Pride.

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:49.201
Yes.

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:54.402
I can see the makeup now, all right.
Little lines that weren't there before.

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.810
The beginning.

01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:00.199
There'll be more, and one day
this face will begin to decay,

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:04.639
and there'll be nothing left to make
a man grovel, to make him want to...

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.330
Why don't you?

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.769
Don't leave me, John.

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:23.719
John, come back. Come back
to my room. John, don't go!

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:26.844
I can make you forget
all those silly lies.

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:31.724
John, come back!

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.806
What's happened?
I thought I heard...

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:45.999
Miss Cooper, Mrs. Shankland has
had a fall. I'm afraid she's hurt.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.559
- I'll come at once.
- What is the matter? What's going on?

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:51.967
Mrs. Shankland has had a fall.

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:56.679
- I'd like my newspaper back.
- Yes. It's on my desk.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.999
- You've read it?
- Yes, I've read it, Mrs. Railton-Bell.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.519
Poor dear. It's so
dark on these stairs.

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:04.319
- Thank you.
- Think nothing of it.

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:09.003
Careful, now. Come along,
Mrs. Shankland. You're all right.

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:10.891
That's all right, now.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:57.639
- How's the weather, Miss Meacham?
- Dry as a bone outside.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:01.083
I should have a winner,
if it stays dry at Newbury.

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:03.719
Did me handicap book arrive?

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:06.526
I think, that looks like it.

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:11.159
Miss Cooper, Mr. Malcolm wasn't in
his room when I took his tea up

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:12.719
and his bed hadn't been slept in.

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.239
Yes, I know, Doreen.

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:17.038
- You know?
- I should have told you. I forgot.

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:20.158
Mr. Malcolm had to go to London
unexpectedly last night.

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:23.359
- He won't be in to breakfast?
- No, I don't suppose he will.

01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:26.599
What about the new lady?
She's not down yet.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:30.282
She's down, Doreen. I think
she'll be in for breakfast.

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:31.801
Okay.

01:08:32.439 --> 01:08:35.291
She's leaving, isn't she?
The new one?

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.359
How did you know?

01:08:38.359 --> 01:08:41.279
I heard her ask for her
bags to be brought down.

01:08:41.279 --> 01:08:43.608
I knew she'd never stick it.

01:08:44.279 --> 01:08:47.439
- "Stick it," Miss Meacham?
- I don't mean the hotel.

01:08:47.439 --> 01:08:50.759
Best for the price in Bournemouth.
I've always said so.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:54.600
I meant the life. She's
not an "alone" type.

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:57.919
Is anyone an "alone" type, really?

01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:01.090
Yes. They're rare, of course.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:05.158
But you are, for one, I'd say.
You're self-sufficient.

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:09.359
I've very glad you think so, Miss Meacham,
perhaps even gladder than you realize.

01:09:09.359 --> 01:09:11.198
What do you mean by that?

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:14.919
I haven't the faintest idea.
I'm a bit tired this morning.

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:16.879
I had very little sleep last night.

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:20.448
Well, I don't suppose
you are glad, really.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.038
Probably you haven't had
to face up to it yet.

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:28.131
I faced up to it very early on.
Long before I was an old wreck.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:32.679
People have always scared
me a bit, you see.

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:34.319
They're so complicated.

01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:37.126
I suppose that's why
I prefer horses.

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.370
Feeling better?

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.006
A bit.

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:08.846
Any word?

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:13.641
No. But I shouldn't worry.
He's been out like this before.

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:18.611
I'd feel much better
if he'd come back.

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:20.888
I must catch that train.

01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:25.762
Thank you for everything.

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:51.529
Hello, Miss R-B. Enjoying
the sunshine, what?

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:55.439
By Jove, what a morning.

01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:57.679
I've been walking on the chines.

01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:02.039
I must say, looking across that sea,
that sky, it could have been Tunis.

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.519
It really could.

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:05.679
I remember, in the spring of '43...

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:08.121
Please, don't pretend anymore.

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:10.839
Pretend? My dear Miss R-B...

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:13.407
The West Hampshire Weekly News.

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.042
Mummy's read it, you see.

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.526
Did she show it to you?

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:22.201
Yes.

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.569
And to all the others.

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:28.850
Miss Cooper, as well?

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:30.767
Yes.

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.844
She's asked Miss Cooper
to tell you to go.

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:37.601
I see.

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:44.642
That's it then, isn't it?

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:46.761
Yes.

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.446
God.

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:54.050
Why did you do it?

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.084
I don't know. I wish
I could answer that.

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:08.079
Why does anybody do anything
that they shouldn't?

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:09.239
Why do some people drink too much,

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:12.125
and other people smoke
50 cigarettes a day?

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:15.731
Because they can't
stop it, I suppose.

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:18.281
Then this wasn't the first time?

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.485
No.

01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:24.370
It's horrible.

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:28.291
Yes, it is, of course. I'm
not trying to defend it.

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:33.919
You've never guessed this,
I know, but ever since school,

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:36.964
I've always been scared
to death of women.

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:41.322
Of everyone, in a way, I
suppose, but mostly of women.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:44.959
I had a bad time at school, which
wasn't Wellington, of course.

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:47.367
It was just a council school.

01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:52.519
Boys hate other boys to be timid and shy,
and they gave it to me good and proper.

01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:53.959
My father despised me, too.

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:57.004
He was a sergeant major
in the Scots Guards.

01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:01.799
He made me join the army, but I was
always a bitter disappointment to him.

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:04.480
He died before I got my commission.

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:08.999
I got that by a wangle, too. It wasn't very
difficult at the beginning of the war.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.362
But it meant everything
to me just the same.

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:15.523
Being saluted, being called "sir."

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:19.683
I thought, "I'm someone
now, a real person."

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:23.525
Perhaps some woman might even...

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:32.125
But it didn't work.
It never has worked.

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:36.049
I'm made in a certain way,
and I can't change it.

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:40.359
It has to be in the dark, you see,
and strangers, because...

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:42.519
Stop it. Stop!

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:45.291
I don't want to hear any more.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.359
You asked me why I did such things

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:52.370
and I wanted to talk
to somebody about it.

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:56.444
I never have, you see,
not in my whole life.

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:01.439
I'm sorry if I upset
you, of all people.

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:04.399
Why me, especially?
Why not the others?

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.719
I don't give a hang
about the others.

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:09.759
They'll all take it
in their various ways

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:14.602
but to them it'll be just another bit
of gossip to snort and snigger over.

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:21.679
But it'll be different for you, Sibyl,
and that makes me very unhappy.

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:24.479
That's the first time
you've called me Sibyl.

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:26.091
Is it really?

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:31.803
Well, there's not much point in all
that "Miss R-B" stuff now, is there?

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:35.444
What makes me so different
from the others?

01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:41.967
I suppose it's because you're so scared
of... Well, shall we call it "life"?

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:46.041
That sounds more respectable
than that word I know you hate.

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:50.289
We're awfully alike, you know,
you and I, in many ways.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:53.199
That's why we've drifted so
much together in this place.

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:55.599
How can you say that we're alike?

01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:58.399
It's just that we're both so
frightened of other people

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:03.003
and we somehow managed to forget our
fright in each other's company.

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:06.608
Speaking for myself, I'm grateful.
I always will be.

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:12.722
I can't expect you to feel
the same way now, of course.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.010
Well, I'd better start
packing, I suppose.

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:25.006
I should be able to
catch the 10:45.

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:30.159
The old Wellingtonian colors.

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:33.284
Why have you told
so many awful lies?

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:38.479
Because I don't like myself the way I am,
so I've had to invent somebody else.

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:40.921
It's not too harmful, really.

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:42.959
We all have our daydreams.

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:46.607
Mine have just gone a step
further than most people's.

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:52.330
Sometimes, I've even managed to
believe in "the Major" myself.

01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:00.170
Well, I'd better get
cracking, I suppose.

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:05.087
Packing up after four years
is hellish business, really.

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:09.129
Has to be done, though.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.851
If I don't see you
again before I go,

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:16.688
I'll write and say goodbye.

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:42.759
But where will you go?

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.485
I don't really know.

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:46.919
A chap in London might put
me up a couple of days.

01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:48.879
Only, I don't really
want to go there.

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:50.525
But why not?

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.965
Well, it's really rather a
case of birds of a feather.

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:02.247
Don't go to him. You
mustn't go to him.

01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:05.639
- I don't really know where else.
- Another hotel.

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:08.079
It can't be Bournemouth,
or anywhere near here.

01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:11.759
It'll have be London, and I don't
know anywhere there I can afford.

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:13.279
I'll lend you some money.

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:16.519
- No, you certainly won't.
- Yes, I have some savings certificates.

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:18.759
You can have those, and
I can get some more...

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:22.442
No, Sibyl. Thank you, but no.
I'll think of somewhere.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.559
I've just remembered a place now.

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:29.004
Cheltenham. It's a very pleasant spot.
I'll go and telephone them right away.

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:35.399
I hate to do this, but could you
possibly lend me a sixpence?

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:37.443
Yes, of course. Here.

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:41.679
Here you are.

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:43.319
Thank you so much.

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:44.399
But...

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:48.650
Don't bother about me. Don't worry.
I'll be perfectly all right. Please.

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:23.650
Are you all right?

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:28.686
Yes, thank you,
I'm quite all right.

01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:33.119
Is there anything I can do to help?

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:36.529
No, thank you. I'm perfectly
all right, thank you.

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:43.999
You're fond of him, aren't you?

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.559
No, I hate him, I despise him.
He's a vile, wicked man,

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:52.319
and he's done a horrible, beastly thing,
and it's not the first time, either.

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:54.170
He admitted that.

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:57.769
God, it's so horrible!

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:08.004
He says we're alike, he and I.

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:10.166
Did he?

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:14.565
He says we're both afraid
of life and people

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:16.806
and sex.

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:19.839
There, I've said it.
I've said the word.

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:22.279
He says I hate saying it, even.

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:24.881
He's right, I do.

01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:29.287
Please, try and control yourself.

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:31.561
Someone may come in.

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:37.206
Will he be all right, do you think?

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:42.283
Because, in spite of what he's done,
I don't want anything bad to happen to him.

01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:45.122
I just want him to be happy.

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:49.002
I want him to find another
friend in his other hotel,

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:51.641
help him to forget his fright.

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:55.368
Do you think that he will?

01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:57.765
I hope so.

01:19:58.480 --> 01:19:59.920
So do I.

01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:02.120
Oh, God.

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:05.086
So do I.

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:22.249
Here's your sixpence.

01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:31.285
I'm afraid that place was full up,
but I'll find something else.

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:35.246
Well,

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:38.130
goodbye, Sibyl.

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:47.005
God bless you.

01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:56.003
I know perfectly well what
you must think of me.

01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:58.880
Thank you for being so kind to her.

01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:05.363
I had a couple of pipes here somewhere.
I'd better take them with me, I suppose.

01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:10.163
That's everything, I think.

01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:44.479
Are you all right?

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:46.682
Yes, I'm all right, Pat.

01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:52.521
That was a fine way to behave,
dashing out into the night.

01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:56.290
- Where have you been?
- I don't know. I walked a long way.

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:58.959
- How is she? Is she all right?
- Your hands are like ice.

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:01.527
What about her? Is she all right?

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:04.884
She's all right, John.
I'll get you some tea.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.119
Did I hurt her?

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:10.769
No. She was pretty hysterical last
night, but that was hardly surprising.

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:13.119
She fell, though, didn't she?

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:14.919
I seem to remember pushing her.

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:17.639
- Her falling, hitting her head...
- She's all right, John.

01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:20.923
Whatever you did, there's
been no damage at all.

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.922
She's leaving this morning.

01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:30.359
Did you ring, Miss?

01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:32.319
Some tea for Mr. Malcolm, please.

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:33.959
Tea? Just before breakfast?

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:36.162
That will be all, Doreen.

01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:37.606
Okay.

01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:51.010
We talked most of the night.
I didn't want to get a doctor.

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:55.091
John, did you know
that she took drugs?

01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:57.919
- Drugs?
- It's only the kind to make you sleep

01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:59.879
but she takes three
times the proper dose.

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:02.519
- The little fool.
- She takes them in the daytime, too.

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.449
Why does she do it?

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:08.281
Why do you go to the Feathers?

01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:10.079
She was going to be married.

01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:11.479
That's not true.

01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:15.401
- But she told me.
- I'm simply telling you, that's not true.

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:21.399
There's not much to choose
between you two, is there?

01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:23.759
Together, you slash
each other to pieces,

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:26.611
apart, you slash
yourselves to pieces.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.487
All told, it's quite a problem.

01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:34.127
- I'm going to tell her that you're here.
- No, Pat, don't do that.

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:37.559
I'll just stay out of her
way till she's gone.

01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:39.919
She's only waiting
to hear how you are.

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:41.719
You can tell her I'm all right.

01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:44.279
You don't think you might
tell her that yourself?

01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:45.686
No, Pat.

01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:50.079
It's your own business. I think if
I was in your place, I'd want to.

01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:54.524
You don't know what it's like to be
in my place. You can't even guess.

01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:58.842
Yes, I think I can, John.

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:06.328
I said there was a refuge
for you here. I was wrong.

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:09.209
There is no refuge.

01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:12.519
- There's no refuge from yourself.
- Stop it, Pat, please.

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:15.121
Listen, why won't you face facts?

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:18.839
Do you think I enjoy seeing your
refuge blown down over your head?

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:21.839
After all, I've shared it with
you for a good many years.

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:23.839
I'm under the debris,
too, you know...

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:26.319
Pat, please!
I'm asking you to stop it!

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:28.522
All right. I'll stop it.

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:31.651
Here we are, all cozy now.

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:34.686
- Put it there, Doreen.
- Righty-o.

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:40.522
She'll have to go, that girl.

01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:43.439
Pat, I'm sorry, but,

01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:47.399
give me one good reason why I
should ever see her again?

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:51.730
All right. Just one then, and God
knows it's not for me to say it.

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:56.006
Because you love her
and she needs you.

01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:00.959
What went on between you last night?
How did she win you over?

01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:04.004
She didn't win me over,
for heaven's sake.

01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:07.206
Feeling the way I do,
do you think she could?

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:11.723
Anyway, to do her justice,
she didn't even try.

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:14.519
I could see her as
she is, all right.

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:16.679
All you've told me about
her is probably true.

01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:20.248
She is vain and spoiled and
selfish and deceitful.

01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:23.519
Of course, with you
being in love with her,

01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:27.359
you see all those things
as sort of monstrous sins.

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:29.999
I see them as ordinary
faults. I don't like them

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.125
but that doesn't stop me being sorry
for a woman who's ill and lonely

01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:36.927
and desperately in need of help.

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:43.491
Well, shall I tell her
that you're here?

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:51.803
No, Pat, just let her
go back to her own life

01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:54.807
and leave me here to
live mine in peace.

01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:59.925
Well, that would be fine, John,
if you'll tell me just one thing.

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:03.683
What sort of peace are
you living in down here?

01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.924
Is it even living?

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:08.445
Is it, John?

01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:10.406
It'll do.

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:16.445
Thank you. At this moment, I don't
think I could have borne tact.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.079
If you won't face her,
there's the door.

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:29.479
Outside's the street. Down
the street is the Feathers.

01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:33.127
It's a bit early, but I'm
sure they'll open up for you.

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:36.960
Come in.

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:43.799
- I'm so sorry, you're busy.
- No, Major, come in. It's all right.

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:47.119
- I can come back.
- It's all right, Major, I was just leaving.

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:50.688
I've already taken up more of Miss
Cooper's time than I deserve.

01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:00.999
I shouldn't have barged in.
I've upset him.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.009
You didn't upset him.

01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:05.399
What can I do for you, Major?

01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:08.604
Just, if you don't mind,
to get my bill ready.

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:13.365
I want to make it
perfectly plain, Major,

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:16.730
that there's no question of my
asking you to leave this hotel.

01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:20.799
If you wish to stay, you're
at perfect liberty to do so.

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:24.319
Well, that's very good of you,
but of course, I have to go.

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:25.399
Very well.

01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:29.446
I'll send you a forwarding address
when I get something fixed.

01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:35.239
I hate to ask, but could I hide here in
your office when I bring my bags down?

01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:37.283
- I don't want to...
- Of course.

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:39.639
And thank you for being so kind.

01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:41.839
I don't deserve it, but
I'm very grateful.

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:44.441
I do wish you'd change your mind.

01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:52.121
Miss Cooper, the plain fact is that I'm far
too much of a coward to stay on here now.

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:56.485
At least you wouldn't be forced into any
more of that "Major" stuff, would you?

01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:01.400
I might be forced into something
a good deal more conclusive.

01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:04.720
Cleaning the old service
revolver, perhaps.

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:07.122
Make a nasty mess on
one of your carpets

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:09.039
and bring an ugly
scandal to your hotel.

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:10.810
I'd take the risk, if you would.

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.085
You're thinking of
Sibyl, of course?

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.526
Sibyl, too, yes.

01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:23.610
Not a hope in the whole
blinking wide world.

01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:25.922
I know my form, you see.

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:30.442
Still, that is the part about
it that I hate the most.

01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:34.519
She's distinctly an odd
one, almost a case.

01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:39.328
Mind of a child and all that. And
yet, she means quite a lot to me.

01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:42.846
I rather think you mean
a lot to her, too.

01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:46.922
I would like to think so.

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:51.799
You know, one's awfully apt to try and
excuse oneself sometimes by saying,

01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:55.004
"What I do doesn't do
anybody else much harm."

01:28:56.080 --> 01:29:00.285
But one does, you see, and that's not
a thought that I like very much.

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:07.644
Well, I mustn't miss
the old train, what?

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:11.968
I must stop saying "what."

01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:14.285
cheery-bye.

01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:18.121
I must stop doing
that, too, I suppose.

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:38.811
Charles.

01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:43.842
Charles, you were asleep.

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:49.159
Darling, I just can't go on
like this. I just simply can't.

01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:50.399
Like what?

01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:53.959
Well, you've just got to marry
me, so I can get some sleep.

01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:56.686
I'm never going to
pass these exams.

01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:59.051
All right.

01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:02.161
What?

01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:04.768
All right, we'll be married.

01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:06.039
Jean.

01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:09.559
After all, it really isn't going to
make the slightest bit of difference.

01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:11.039
We'd better call my mother,

01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:12.999
so she can get started
on the arrangements.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.559
And you'd better call
your father in Liverpool.

01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:18.319
Charles, how many children
do you think we should have?

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:21.251
I think maybe three
to start, don't you?

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:24.571
Yes, dear.

01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:34.479
Good morning, Mr. Malcolm.

01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:36.762
Good morning, Miss Meacham.

01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:56.079
Are you all right, Ann?

01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:59.399
Yes, thank you. I was
worried about you.

01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:00.965
You shouldn't have been.

01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:03.599
Toast, Mrs. Shankland?

01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:05.279
No, thank you.

01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:06.839
Haddock or boiled egg?

01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:08.804
Just coffee, please.

01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:16.923
I'm glad you came in.

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:21.207
It gives me a chance to say how
sorry I am I had to lie to you.

01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:34.208
Tell me something, Ann.
When you say you need me,

01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:37.919
is it me that you
need or just my love?

01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:40.202
Because if it's my love, you
must know that you have that.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.407
- It's you, John.
- Why?

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:47.129
I suppose because you're
all the things I'm not.

01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:50.999
You're honest and true and
dependable and sincere and...

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.646
Virtues that I don't have anymore.

01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:57.123
So you see, Ann, I could
never satisfy your need.

01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:00.730
I know that you could
never satisfy mine.

01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:03.162
I would never try to again.

01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:06.647
I won't bother you anymore.

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:11.689
Going back to New York?

01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:13.279
I suppose so.

01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:16.319
You must have friends there,
hundreds of acquaintances...

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:18.439
You know better than that, John.

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:20.439
It's hard to believe,

01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:24.440
but you can be more alone in
New York than in this hotel.

01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:30.366
Even with their separate tables,
they can talk back and forth.

01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:34.241
Being alone in a crowd is worse.

01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:37.970
It's more painful,
more frightening.

01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:42.410
So frightening.

01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:50.487
I'm an awful coward, you see.

01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:54.210
I've never been able to
face anything alone.

01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:57.684
Being ill, having
operations and all that.

01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:00.368
Now I can't even face

01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:03.604
just getting old.

01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:08.842
That damn waitress will come
back and catch me crying.

01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:13.159
How did you sleep, dear?

01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:16.639
Not at all well. That dreadful
business about the Major.

01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:20.811
I know. Nerve-wracking, isn't it?
I'm utterly shattered, myself.

01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:32.999
Poached eggs for you, isn't it?

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:34.519
You should know by now,

01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:38.159
that Miss Railton-Bell never has anything
but a poached egg for breakfast.

01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:41.170
I forget things, dear.
That's my trouble.

01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:42.959
There we are.

01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:44.839
Eat your egg, dear.

01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:49.409
You don't want people to think you're still
upset over that horrible man, do you?

01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:51.925
No, Mummy.

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:08.724
Sorry, Major, there's been a muddle.
I'll lay your table right away.

01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:18.450
Mabel, No. 7's in.
You said he was out.

01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:22.123
That's what Edgar said.
Edgar said he was leaving.

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:37.279
Haddock? It's nice this morning.

01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:39.289
Very well, thank you.

01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:41.405
There we are.

01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:44.770
All cozy now.

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:15.405
Good morning.

01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:21.810
Good morning.

01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:33.125
Good morning.

01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:39.639
Good morning.

01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:41.519
Lovely day, isn't it?

01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:43.119
Yes, it is.

01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:45.159
It should be fine for the course.

01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:48.364
If the weather holds up, I could
give you a winner tomorrow.

01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:50.683
Thank you very much.

01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:53.651
I may not be here tomorrow.

01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:55.641
I see.

01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:58.800
It's suddenly turned very cold
in here, dear, don't you think?

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:03.967
I think I shall move my chair
around out of the draft.

01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:20.250
Good morning. Have you seen
the latest cricket score?

01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:22.759
No, I haven't.

01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:26.407
We're doing rather well.
Australia all out 246.

01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:32.086
- I am glad to hear that.
- Yes, it is encouraging, isn't it?

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:39.085
Well, really.

01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:46.719
Good morning.

01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:48.126
Gladys.

01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:52.928
I hope you're having the
haddock. It's delicious.

01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:55.204
- Yes, I am.
- Good.

01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:58.525
Come, Sibyl.

01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:00.519
I haven't finished yet.

01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:04.039
It doesn't matter, dear.
Come with me into the lounge.

01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:05.571
No, Mummy.

01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:13.882
Sibyl, come with me at once.

01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:19.443
No, Mummy. I'm going to stay here in the
dining room and finish my breakfast.

01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:39.604
I saw the new moon through
glass last night.

01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:42.439
Did you, indeed?

01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:45.484
Some people think that's
unlucky, don't they?

01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:48.079
Yes, they do.

01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:51.523
But then, I don't believe
in superstitions. Do you?

01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:55.126
No, as a matter of fact, I don't.

01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:01.006
You know, Ann, that we don't
have very much hope together.

01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:05.568
Have we all that much apart?

01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:17.442
Good morning, Lady Matheson.

01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:21.048
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:26.123
Edgar says your taxi has
arrived, Mr. Pollock.

01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:36.559
Ask him to send it away
again, would you, please?

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:40.207
Very well. Lunch at
the usual time then?

01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:48.848
Lunch at the usual time.

01:38:49.305 --> 01:38:55.455
