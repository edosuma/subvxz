01:28.858 --> 01:31.100
-Where is he?
-He promised.

01:31.736 --> 01:33.230
You know his promises.

01:34.488 --> 01:37.262
-He's not gonna miss this, is he?
-He'll be here, sweetheart.

01:37.366 --> 01:40.599
But.... Well, that's okay, Joaquin,
put them all on the front of the float.

01:40.703 --> 01:42.017
Where's all the flags?

01:42.121 --> 01:43.200
Okay.

01:52.256 --> 01:55.115
-Jeff, for God's sake.
-l'm here. l'm ready.

01:55.219 --> 01:57.970
-l'm going. General Grant, right?
-Jeffrey. Jeff.

01:58.096 --> 01:59.785
-Get dressed!
-l'm getting dressed!

01:59.889 --> 02:01.621
-Go. Go!
-He had a beard, you know.

02:01.725 --> 02:04.512
-Jeffrey.
-Never mind! Never mind!

02:04.769 --> 02:06.846
l love it! lt's fabulous.

02:24.791 --> 02:27.272
-That looks like a blue ribbon.
-You say that every year.

02:27.376 --> 02:30.734
l know, we're right up front, between
Valley Realty and Darrell's Body Shop.

02:30.838 --> 02:31.918
l'm telling you.

02:36.761 --> 02:39.119
-You're not dressed!
-What do you mean, l'm not dressed?

02:39.223 --> 02:40.370
l'm dressed great.

02:40.474 --> 02:42.496
-This is a parade.
-And l'm ready to march.

02:42.600 --> 02:46.584
You look like you're ready to dance.
That outfit does not spell ''defence.''

02:46.689 --> 02:48.727
-What does it spell?
-''Barbara.''

03:08.878 --> 03:10.859
Do you still prefer McDonald's
for work experience?

03:10.963 --> 03:12.653
-Miguel!
-McDonald's for work experience.

03:12.757 --> 03:14.446
-l'm having second thoughts.
-Not now, Miguel.

03:14.550 --> 03:16.573
Ms McLaughlin,
l'm considering Long John Silver's.

03:16.678 --> 03:20.410
-l looked into the future and it may be fish.
-Miguel, after the parade.

03:20.515 --> 03:22.673
l'm busy with other people's futures
right now.

03:23.811 --> 03:25.749
Looks like you're doing fine, Sgt Leathers.

03:25.853 --> 03:27.918
l'll be over at the Army booth.
They always need help.

03:28.022 --> 03:30.380
And what are you gonna do after the parade,
Ms McLaughlin?

03:30.484 --> 03:33.354
-l think l'm gonna lie down.
-Alone?

03:33.695 --> 03:35.854
Stand by! Ten-hut!

03:51.255 --> 03:52.334
Hi.

04:06.688 --> 04:09.013
-Hey, Jeff. Jeff.
-Come on down here.

04:09.315 --> 04:11.380
-Hey, what are you guys doing?
-Air Force Academy.

04:11.484 --> 04:13.300
-They're setting up interviews.
-We gotta sign up.

04:13.404 --> 04:15.634
-Look here, cadet, how many fingers?
-What? What?

04:15.738 --> 04:19.014
''Four,'' the man said. Kee-rect!
Now, what's the colour of your white jacket?

04:19.118 --> 04:21.099
-You've lost it totally.
-The man said ''white.''

04:21.202 --> 04:22.266
''White'' is A-okay.

04:22.370 --> 04:24.394
-Certify him for night flying.
-You're in.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.563
-Congratulations, cadet.
-Sign right here.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.336
Give me it. ''Applicant,'' that's me.

04:31.255 --> 04:32.334
All right.

05:27.438 --> 05:30.225
What are you doing here?
You shouldn't be here.

05:33.444 --> 05:37.656
What do you want? Are you crazy? No!

06:13.152 --> 06:14.967
<i>It was the first summit handshake
in years....</i>

06:15.071 --> 06:18.903
-His tie comes from Paris.
-Certainly an improvement on Brezhnev.

06:19.367 --> 06:21.473
The suit is ltalian.

06:21.578 --> 06:24.532
Madam sends to Milan for her clothes.

06:25.707 --> 06:27.813
-What about my roof?
-Your what?

06:27.917 --> 06:28.997
My....

06:29.544 --> 06:31.169
His cover.

06:33.382 --> 06:36.631
San Diego County Agricultural Exchange.

06:37.637 --> 06:39.012
You know the area?

06:40.555 --> 06:41.634
lntimately.

06:42.641 --> 06:46.457
When you reach San Diego,
you have not only the FBl to deal with....

06:46.561 --> 06:50.545
Also the Navy lnvestigative Service,
the Defence lnvestigative Service...

06:50.650 --> 06:53.140
plus Customs and lmmigration officials.

06:53.485 --> 06:55.609
San Diego is very active.

06:56.155 --> 06:57.863
You do understand?

06:57.991 --> 07:03.032
Young man, l was crossing into the West
before you could spell Bolshevik.

07:04.871 --> 07:07.743
A canon is loose in San Diego.

07:07.876 --> 07:11.956
-You know him. He belongs to us.
-The Americans have coded him ''Scuba.''

07:12.922 --> 07:14.796
Their attempt to be amusing.

07:15.175 --> 07:20.002
You are to apprehend Scuba.
He has killed one of our best agents.

07:20.305 --> 07:24.718
-Scuba is an embarrassment to the premier.
-The premier prepares for the summit.

07:24.851 --> 07:28.919
-A sideshow.
-This lRS man was working for us.

07:29.023 --> 07:33.899
Scuba is blackmailing us. He will keep
killing our agents until we give him money.

07:34.195 --> 07:38.774
Return Scuba to Russia, alive.
That is your assignment.

07:39.534 --> 07:42.025
You have seen the dossier
on your backups?

07:42.203 --> 07:44.196
l prefer our man in Vancouver.

07:44.497 --> 07:47.498
-The operative word is discretion.
-No press.

07:47.875 --> 07:49.702
No publicity.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.413
No news at all.

07:51.671 --> 07:54.756
What we fear most is the American media.

07:55.758 --> 07:59.174
l remember when we used to fear the ClA.

07:59.888 --> 08:02.461
Everything changes, Karpov.

08:04.976 --> 08:08.926
<i>This Iatest series of taIks
between the two great superpowers.</i>

08:09.314 --> 08:11.022
Nothing changes.

08:11.149 --> 08:13.799
<i>The first historic meeting
between these two worId Ieaders...</i>

08:13.903 --> 08:15.645
<i>signaIs the beginning of a new chapter....</i>

08:55.655 --> 08:57.678
More applications, Roy.

08:57.782 --> 09:00.984
These didn't come up kosher, either.

09:01.702 --> 09:05.810
l say that we've got a run
on the Air Force Academy this year.

09:05.914 --> 09:07.991
That's one way to beat Army.

09:10.378 --> 09:13.235
Chief, you're drowning me in paper.

09:13.339 --> 09:18.085
Stats, Roy, stats.
The inspector's going to pay us a visit.

09:18.595 --> 09:21.631
Did you see the thing
about the lRS man at Caliente?

09:21.848 --> 09:23.390
What lRS man?

09:23.683 --> 09:26.803
The one they found behind the pari-mutuel
with his throat cut.

09:29.731 --> 09:32.671
What do you and Totten do in here
every morning at 6:00 a.m?

09:32.776 --> 09:34.716
Check the Hong Kong prices?

09:34.820 --> 09:36.091
l know a horse player.

09:36.196 --> 09:40.389
Forget about Scuba, Roy.
The man is a burnt-out double agent.

09:40.493 --> 09:44.558
Scuba has been turned so many times
he looks like an omelette.

09:44.663 --> 09:46.822
The man killed my partner.

09:48.500 --> 09:51.039
You don't know if he killed him or not.

10:01.305 --> 10:04.093
Jesus, Roy, that was 20 years ago.

10:05.435 --> 10:06.549
So what?

10:09.981 --> 10:13.480
l gotta go. l'm presenting
the hole-in-one trophy tonight.

10:16.071 --> 10:18.526
Hey. Hang in there, Roy.

10:31.254 --> 10:33.459
Okay, let's see this kid.

11:28.646 --> 11:30.638
What have we got here?

11:36.905 --> 11:39.762
l need a reading
on Richard and Elizabeth Grant.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.823
Fountain Grove, California. Son, Jeffrey.

11:44.287 --> 11:45.366
Yeah.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.366
lt doesn't track for me.

11:52.170 --> 11:54.127
Did these people die or what?

11:59.137 --> 12:01.367
-Go, Air Force!
-Yeah, go, Air Force.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.096
Will you sit down?

12:04.017 --> 12:06.685
-Turn the radio off.
-Hey, look at this guy.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.439
Jeffrey Grant.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.356
-All right.
-Go get them.

12:17.197 --> 12:18.302
Good luck, buddy.

12:18.406 --> 12:21.193
And remember,
''You live in fame or go down in flame.''

12:43.933 --> 12:45.592
Excuse me, Corporal.

13:10.919 --> 13:13.588
-What do you think?
-Sorry?

13:14.339 --> 13:15.749
Corporal Hogan.

13:16.424 --> 13:17.587
Oh, her.

13:17.968 --> 13:22.118
-Yeah, yeah, she was very nice.
-Yes, very nice.

13:22.222 --> 13:25.591
Sometimes l slip up
and call her Corporal Hogans.

13:27.562 --> 13:31.689
Roy Howe, Jeff, Air Force Reserve Liaison.
l'll be conducting your Academy interview.

13:32.734 --> 13:35.437
You got a wet palm there, son.
What's the matter? Nervous?

13:35.569 --> 13:37.550
-Yeah, l'm nervous.
-What are you nervous about?

13:37.654 --> 13:40.387
-l don't know. l want to pass.
-There's nothing to pass.

13:40.491 --> 13:43.576
This isn't a test. Relax. Be yourself.

13:44.370 --> 13:45.450
Okay.

13:50.418 --> 13:52.541
You are nervous, aren't you? Why?

13:53.587 --> 13:55.711
Because you told me to be myself.

13:55.924 --> 13:58.864
Whenever people tell me to be myself,
l don't know what to do.

13:58.969 --> 14:02.053
-How come?
-'Cause l don't know what myself is.

14:04.766 --> 14:06.924
-You like girls, Jim?
-Jeff.

14:07.102 --> 14:08.726
How do you feel about girls, Jeff?

14:09.521 --> 14:10.668
l love them.

14:10.772 --> 14:12.003
-You got a girl?
-You bet.

14:12.107 --> 14:13.379
-You have one girl?
-Yeah.

14:13.483 --> 14:14.630
No. Yeah.

14:14.735 --> 14:18.051
Yeah. l do have one girl,
and l like her a lot...

14:18.156 --> 14:20.112
but l love girls in general.

14:23.536 --> 14:25.077
You're doing fine.

14:25.954 --> 14:28.145
Why do you want to go
to the Air Force Academy, John?

14:28.249 --> 14:30.242
Jeff. Jeff, Jeff.

14:34.339 --> 14:36.877
l hear you. You hear me?

14:38.759 --> 14:41.168
l wanna fly. l wanna be a pilot.

14:41.554 --> 14:42.717
That's it?

14:43.139 --> 14:44.419
l love my country.

14:46.226 --> 14:47.289
That's all?

14:47.394 --> 14:49.333
Hey, what can l tell you? l gotta fly.

14:49.437 --> 14:52.355
-Why?
-l like to go fast.

14:53.859 --> 14:56.424
-l can see that.
-Only three tickets.

14:56.528 --> 14:57.592
ln a month?

14:57.696 --> 15:01.263
40 in a 35. l was on the freeway at 5:00 a.m.
Alone on the road--

15:01.367 --> 15:03.973
-You don't deserve the citation?
-No.

15:04.077 --> 15:06.236
Yeah, yeah, l do.

15:06.371 --> 15:08.660
l drive too fast. But l'm a good driver.

15:09.416 --> 15:11.456
Sorry. l'm working on it, sir.

15:12.587 --> 15:14.247
Work hard.

15:14.422 --> 15:16.710
Yes, sir. l will, sir.

15:20.512 --> 15:23.215
-Are you sucking up to me?
-Yes, sir.

15:24.099 --> 15:25.557
No, sir. l....

15:27.976 --> 15:30.729
What do your folks say
about your heavy foot?

15:31.273 --> 15:36.184
-Dad.... You know how fathers are.
-No, l don't know how fathers are.

15:36.820 --> 15:39.572
Well, he's not crazy about it.

15:39.823 --> 15:43.806
And neither is Mum. l can understand them.
They don't want me to get hurt.

15:43.910 --> 15:46.726
-What about your folks?
-What about them?

15:46.830 --> 15:49.437
There's nothing much to tell.

15:49.541 --> 15:52.543
My mum and dad,
they run a garden nursery, and....

15:54.004 --> 15:55.202
l love them.

16:00.177 --> 16:02.952
What do your folks think
about your going to the Academy?

16:03.056 --> 16:04.467
They don't know about it.

16:08.436 --> 16:10.643
l want to surprise them
with some good news.

16:14.859 --> 16:16.603
Did l say the wrong thing?

16:18.028 --> 16:20.520
No. Not at all, comrade.

16:27.038 --> 16:28.118
l'm sorry.

16:31.626 --> 16:33.085
l don't understand.

16:37.674 --> 16:39.418
-ls that all?
-For now.

16:43.305 --> 16:47.055
''Jeffrey N. Grant.''
What does the ''N'' stand for?

16:47.185 --> 16:48.810
-Nicholas.
-Nicholas.

16:49.770 --> 16:51.430
You of Greek extraction...

16:51.563 --> 16:53.420
or is your birthday near to Christmas?

16:53.525 --> 16:54.964
l don't know. l used to hate the name.

16:55.068 --> 16:58.551
Then l went through this period where
that's all l wanted to be called, ''Nick.''

16:58.655 --> 17:01.554
-l thought it was tough. Now l hate it again.
-We'll be talking again.

17:01.658 --> 17:03.900
-Great!
-About something else.

17:04.202 --> 17:06.906
-l thought l'd passed.
-For now.

17:07.289 --> 17:10.574
Blue skies, Jeff.
Happy landings and pack a tight chute.

17:14.172 --> 17:15.333
What was that?

17:15.714 --> 17:16.792
No good?

17:17.340 --> 17:19.963
l practised this morning. l thought l'd do it.
Now l blew it.

17:21.094 --> 17:22.423
lt wasn't too bad.

17:23.430 --> 17:25.424
Bye, Corporal Hogans.

17:27.809 --> 17:29.517
Good, Jeff, good.

19:43.450 --> 19:45.556
You must be tired, Comrade Karpov.

19:45.661 --> 19:47.684
No, just have nothing to say.

19:47.788 --> 19:50.458
l still do not understand
why they sent you here.

19:51.084 --> 19:52.791
To get the job done.

19:53.168 --> 19:55.735
l think we should go through
the list of your contacts again.

19:55.839 --> 19:58.653
-What for?
-To make sure you remember them all.

19:58.757 --> 20:02.092
-Even you could forget.
-l doubt it. l put them here.

20:03.555 --> 20:05.927
<i>Too bad about our IoveIy water-skier.</i>

20:06.183 --> 20:08.056
<i>She was a good agent.</i>

20:10.227 --> 20:13.099
Scuba made contact with you only once?

20:13.815 --> 20:15.755
As l told you, a brief message...

20:15.859 --> 20:19.442
''Pay $200,000
or l'll kill every agent on the list.''

20:20.405 --> 20:22.197
Only four more to go.

20:25.285 --> 20:27.776
l heard you gave him
the code name ''Scuba.''

20:28.456 --> 20:31.409
No, an FBl agent did.

20:32.167 --> 20:33.627
But why?

20:36.505 --> 20:37.999
He loves water.

20:38.757 --> 20:40.087
Like a shark.

20:40.677 --> 20:42.170
No, like a rat.

20:44.764 --> 20:47.469
Stop here, before we get to the border.

20:54.815 --> 20:57.142
We have organised a pickup
on the other side.

20:57.402 --> 20:59.644
l prefer public transportation.

21:00.488 --> 21:02.887
l guess that's okay,
but l don't have to tell you--

21:02.991 --> 21:04.189
No, you don't.

21:23.221 --> 21:28.381
<i>WeIcome aboard the San Diego troIIey,
bound for the Santa Fe Depot in centre city.</i>

21:28.810 --> 21:33.186
<i>We appreciate having you on board today
and hope you have a pIeasant trip.</i>

21:56.798 --> 21:58.077
You call a taxi?

22:09.810 --> 22:12.515
Are you the man
who wants to go to Fountain Grove?

22:23.365 --> 22:25.431
He crossed the border yesterday.

22:25.535 --> 22:28.157
Turned up in a coffee shop
in Fountain Grove.

22:28.413 --> 22:30.655
He didn't give up
on public transportation, did he?

22:32.125 --> 22:35.692
He was at the Union Station stakeout in D.C.
20 years ago when Scuba--

22:35.796 --> 22:38.631
Oh, yeah, right, right.
Look at that son of a bitch.

22:39.133 --> 22:41.042
He still looks real good.

22:41.760 --> 22:44.200
Why did you ask me in here
before everyone else?

22:44.304 --> 22:45.929
Because you're the best, Roy.

22:46.808 --> 22:49.539
l should be reporting to you,
instead of the other way around.

22:49.643 --> 22:51.959
-Don't stroke me, Jim.
-What do you want me to tell you?

22:52.063 --> 22:53.308
That l got Scuba.

22:53.856 --> 22:56.921
You know there's a case.
You can feel it inside, just like l do.

22:57.026 --> 22:59.883
Karpov is here to get Scuba.

22:59.987 --> 23:03.024
The Bureau is maintaining
a hands-off policy.

23:03.450 --> 23:06.556
Screw the Bureau. What is your policy, Jim?
You know l'm right.

23:06.660 --> 23:09.101
l don't give a damn
whether you're right or wrong, Roy.

23:09.206 --> 23:11.395
l just wanna see you get on with your life.

23:11.500 --> 23:14.869
Get it resolved. You owe it to yourself.

23:15.629 --> 23:17.088
So l got Scuba?

23:18.465 --> 23:21.864
Yeah, you got Scuba. He's all yours.

23:21.969 --> 23:25.801
But you're on your own.
lt is strictly unofficial.

23:26.056 --> 23:28.464
No one but me knows about it.

23:29.184 --> 23:30.382
Understand?

23:33.063 --> 23:34.261
Thanks, Jim.

23:38.485 --> 23:41.059
Don't forget your Air Force applications.

24:51.103 --> 24:56.310
So they spotted him
in a coffee shop in Fountain Grove.

24:56.650 --> 24:59.022
Fountain Grove? Wait a minute.

26:01.426 --> 26:04.241
Well, what's the big deal?
l'm just applying for traffic school.

26:04.345 --> 26:07.015
-Down the hall, Grant. Room 1 .
-Please.

26:07.140 --> 26:11.054
All l want is Saturday's class.
lf l don't get in, l don't get my licence back.

26:11.353 --> 26:13.262
Sorry, Grant. Room 1 .

26:14.439 --> 26:15.518
Room 1 .

26:15.940 --> 26:18.017
Department of Motor Vehicles, please hold.

26:25.951 --> 26:29.035
-Hello, Jeff.
-Hi, Major. What are you doing here?

26:30.205 --> 26:31.748
Let's take a ride.

26:32.416 --> 26:33.591
Take a ride? Take a ride where?

26:37.695 --> 26:38.234
[ Skipped item nr. 257 ]

26:38.339 --> 26:39.963
Because l asked you to.

26:46.639 --> 26:48.912
-Did you read it?
-l'll show you my lD.

26:49.016 --> 26:51.999
lt gets me a beer in a disco in Encinitas.
What does yours get you?

26:52.104 --> 26:54.938
Mine gets me this.

26:57.442 --> 26:59.814
l could fix the licence, but not that picture.

27:03.240 --> 27:04.345
Am l under arrest?

27:04.450 --> 27:06.054
-What for? Did you do something wrong?
-No.

27:06.159 --> 27:07.348
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

27:07.453 --> 27:10.122
Relax.
l just want to ask you a few questions.

27:14.710 --> 27:18.026
See that storefront over there? That's
Congressman Larkin's suburban office.

27:18.130 --> 27:21.333
Someone in there is selling nominations
to the service academies.

27:21.884 --> 27:23.657
lf someone's selling, someone's buying.

27:23.761 --> 27:25.220
Bingo. A-plus.

27:25.513 --> 27:27.339
ls that what you wanted to talk to me about?

27:30.476 --> 27:33.097
How long have you known Tony Stanton
and Tom Stubblefield?

27:33.354 --> 27:36.503
-All my life. They're my friends.
-Friends have a way of changing.

27:36.607 --> 27:38.814
-Now, wait a minute.
-How about their parents?

27:38.943 --> 27:40.341
Their parents are my friends, too.

27:40.445 --> 27:43.445
lf you think someone did something funny,
go talk to someone else.

27:44.991 --> 27:46.071
Okay.

27:53.292 --> 27:55.283
Which brings us to the Grants.

27:56.169 --> 27:59.254
-Your folks working late?
-Yeah, they're in the potting shed.

27:59.840 --> 28:03.174
-l guess the mushrooms are coming up.
-Can l go now?

28:03.594 --> 28:06.880
-Keep your ears open.
-You mean, sneak around my friends?

28:07.807 --> 28:09.955
You want to go to the Air Force Academy,
don't you?

28:10.059 --> 28:13.974
You think it's fair for a guy
to buy his way in? Take your place?

28:14.271 --> 28:16.181
No, no.

28:28.494 --> 28:30.903
And don't mention anything to your folks.

28:32.708 --> 28:35.495
-What do you mean?
-Let's keep this between us.

28:36.045 --> 28:37.243
Why?

28:38.088 --> 28:40.793
You wanted to surprise your parents,
didn't you?

28:41.050 --> 28:43.042
-Yeah.
-Okay.

28:46.180 --> 28:47.259
And Jeff...

28:49.225 --> 28:51.513
l'm glad you got your licence back.

29:00.903 --> 29:03.970
This one's pretty.
l think l'll take this one, too.

29:04.074 --> 29:06.564
No, if l take this one,
l'll have to have another one.

29:07.201 --> 29:09.278
That one. That one over there.

29:14.751 --> 29:17.242
-Jeff. Jeff, Jeff!
-What?

29:17.795 --> 29:18.942
Didn't l tell you fruit trees?

29:19.046 --> 29:20.737
Fruit trees? l thought this was a cactus sale.

29:20.841 --> 29:23.280
l want to dress it up a bit
with a pair of dwarf persimmons.

29:23.384 --> 29:26.090
Dwarf persimmons?
Fruit trees for short people.

29:26.513 --> 29:28.553
Bring out a Mexican Old Man.

29:29.308 --> 29:32.957
-Now l'm a social worker.
-You can take these right to the cashier.

29:33.062 --> 29:34.805
-All right.
-Thank you very much.

29:36.649 --> 29:38.974
There's nothing to be afraid of
with plants, sir.

29:39.443 --> 29:42.895
l know what's coming. ''Talk to them.''
l don't want to talk to them.

29:43.447 --> 29:47.067
l will water, but not a whole lot, however.
l don't have the time.

29:47.577 --> 29:49.099
How is the light in your nook?

29:49.203 --> 29:50.308
Don't start that.

29:50.413 --> 29:53.688
That's what the last guy asked me,
and l was doing sun studies for a month.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.875
l guess what l'm looking for
is something fat.

29:57.503 --> 29:58.915
A fat plant?

29:59.506 --> 30:01.830
-All fat with leaves.
-Bushy?

30:02.467 --> 30:04.073
-You tell me.
-Hold on, hold on.

30:04.178 --> 30:05.617
Richard?

30:05.721 --> 30:09.089
The gentleman is looking for a fat plant
to fill a nook.

30:09.224 --> 30:12.415
Lots of leaves, and he doesn't want to worry
about water or light.

30:12.519 --> 30:14.374
Plastic. You want a plastic plant. Kmart.

30:14.479 --> 30:17.516
-No, l don't want plastic. l want real.
-Excuse me.

30:17.650 --> 30:19.310
What are you doing, mister?

30:19.485 --> 30:22.050
-What do you think l'm doing?
-Not what l told you to do.

30:22.154 --> 30:25.303
-You told me to find the Mexican Old Man.
-That's not a Mexican Old Man.

30:25.408 --> 30:28.278
That's a candelabra cactus. Now put it back.
Put it back.

30:38.005 --> 30:39.249
What is this?

30:39.797 --> 30:43.298
-That's a meditation tree. They're from lndia.
-Help you relax.

30:43.969 --> 30:45.296
That's for me.

30:45.553 --> 30:47.795
What do you think, son?
Will it help me relax?

30:48.265 --> 30:49.759
l certainly hope so.

30:52.143 --> 30:54.459
Now, let them off there, folks,
then come on aboard.

30:54.563 --> 30:55.794
Yeah, they're really biting today.

30:55.898 --> 30:59.148
-What did you get, Richard?
-Bonita, sheephead, mackerel, bass.

30:59.693 --> 31:01.841
-What about you, Jeff?
-Tell him. Tell him.

31:01.946 --> 31:03.854
-Tell him what?
-What you got.

31:05.116 --> 31:07.806
-l got a tyre and a tin can.
-Next time.

31:07.910 --> 31:09.618
Okay, hit the smoker, anglers.

31:10.329 --> 31:11.408
Oh, thanks.

31:25.469 --> 31:26.881
Eight pounds.

31:27.264 --> 31:28.343
Okay.

31:28.806 --> 31:31.724
-Where's Aurelio?
-Three-time loser.

31:31.934 --> 31:34.687
Border patrol grabbed him.
Someone blew the whistle on him.

31:36.064 --> 31:37.143
Hello.

31:39.151 --> 31:41.356
-l like your new helper.
-Yeah, he's Joe.

31:41.527 --> 31:43.593
Yugo out of Vancouver.
Wouldn't you believe it?

31:43.697 --> 31:45.053
He talks less English than Aurelio.

31:45.157 --> 31:48.514
<i>-Why don't you just get another bracero?
-l don't know. This guy just showed up.</i>

31:48.618 --> 31:50.767
-l'll see you in a couple of weeks, Bucky.
-Yo, Richard.

31:50.871 --> 31:52.663
<i>Do you have a fiIe on Jeffrey Grant?</i>

31:53.916 --> 31:55.244
What kind of file?

31:56.043 --> 31:57.122
Grades...

31:57.753 --> 32:00.920
extra-curricular activities.
Going back, say, a couple of years.

32:02.717 --> 32:05.042
Why would l show you Jeffrey Grant's file?

32:08.556 --> 32:09.836
l'm FBl.

32:10.766 --> 32:13.471
You could be NFL for all l care.

32:14.979 --> 32:16.058
Please?

32:17.232 --> 32:19.354
-Good kid?
-Straight A's.

32:19.484 --> 32:22.770
He tells his friends he gets C's.
Wonderful kid.

32:23.864 --> 32:25.571
What about his parents?

32:25.865 --> 32:29.615
PTA, the Rotary, the United Way.

32:30.037 --> 32:33.687
They love their kid, their kid loves them.
lt's a close family.

32:33.791 --> 32:34.870
Close?

32:36.627 --> 32:37.706
Pardon?

32:39.964 --> 32:41.541
lt's close in here.

32:43.592 --> 32:47.460
''lf there's no window, there's no air.''
An old saying.

32:52.351 --> 32:55.056
Well, that do it for you?

32:56.690 --> 32:59.643
How'd a pretty girl like you
get mixed up in guidance counselling?

33:02.404 --> 33:05.488
How'd a nice guy like you
get mixed up in the FBl?

33:05.990 --> 33:08.778
You ever guided any students
towards the Bureau, Verna?

33:10.119 --> 33:13.739
-l hope not.
-How about me guiding you towards dinner?

33:33.019 --> 33:34.099
Richard!

33:40.068 --> 33:41.182
Mum?

33:43.446 --> 33:44.940
You okay, Mum?

33:46.116 --> 33:47.230
Mum?

36:19.023 --> 36:21.942
-Looks like a one-dash.
-No, a dash-one.

36:25.697 --> 36:26.978
five...

36:27.825 --> 36:28.904
seven....

36:29.952 --> 36:35.113
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, dash-one.

36:43.341 --> 36:44.918
''Kirov opening.''

37:09.034 --> 37:11.183
<i>Okay, Cindy, go get the baII!</i>

37:11.287 --> 37:14.074
<i>Diego, the ring! Starbuck, the bIock!</i>

37:15.708 --> 37:18.662
<i>Okay, good girI, Cindy. Great, guys.</i>

37:19.337 --> 37:22.124
<i>Attaboy. Good boy, Diego.</i>

37:22.298 --> 37:24.374
<i>Yeah, that's a good boy.</i>

37:29.472 --> 37:31.678
<i>Where did this come from?</i>

37:32.100 --> 37:34.887
<i>Where did you get this, you IittIe deviI?</i>

37:36.563 --> 37:39.729
There's a body in the water!
Call the harbour police.

37:40.608 --> 37:41.984
Let's get the police!

39:21.338 --> 39:22.666
Jeff!

39:23.049 --> 39:24.591
What happened?

39:25.760 --> 39:27.751
-ls he hurt?
-Oh, honey.

39:28.471 --> 39:31.244
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine. l'm fine.

39:31.349 --> 39:32.662
Howdy, folks.

39:32.766 --> 39:35.803
Roy Parmenter here,
your new neighbour from across the street.

39:35.978 --> 39:39.597
l'm Richard Grant.
This is my wife, Elizabeth.

39:40.441 --> 39:42.756
And this is our son, Jeffrey.
Are you okay, Jeff?

39:42.860 --> 39:43.940
Yeah. Yeah, l'm fine.

39:46.531 --> 39:47.729
Haven't....

39:47.949 --> 39:50.431
-Have we met somewhere?
-You look so familiar.

39:50.535 --> 39:53.370
Sure. l swung by once
to buy a plant for my office.

39:54.747 --> 39:55.827
Hi, Jeff.

39:56.082 --> 39:57.577
Put her there.

39:59.753 --> 40:02.861
Now, that's what l call a handshake!
And l could use the other hand, too.

40:02.965 --> 40:04.820
Help me load in over there,
you know what l mean?

40:04.924 --> 40:07.333
-l don't think so.
-He'd love to, Mr Parmenter.

40:07.470 --> 40:10.257
Call me Roy. May l call you Richard?
And you're Betty, right?

40:10.680 --> 40:13.885
-Elizabeth is good enough.
-What happened to Sgt Juckett?

40:14.101 --> 40:17.434
He got transferred back to Parris lsland.
Lucky me.

40:18.146 --> 40:21.338
-l pay well.
-You don't have to pay Jeff a thing.

40:21.442 --> 40:25.191
-You're in Fountain Grove now, Roy.
-And it's real pleasant to be here.

40:25.405 --> 40:27.646
-Where do you hail from?
-Philadelphia.

40:28.866 --> 40:33.612
Navy. l write specs for ships
and they transferred me out here.

40:34.581 --> 40:38.958
Talk about a break. Great weather,
San Diego. And nice neighbours.

40:40.420 --> 40:44.998
And someone to shoot baskets with.
You ready to go one-on-one, Jeff?

40:46.260 --> 40:47.754
-No.
-Jeff!

40:48.428 --> 40:50.670
Go along now. Help out Mr Parmenter.

41:02.442 --> 41:05.759
What the hell are you doing here?
Every time l turn around, you're around.

41:05.863 --> 41:07.969
Just trying to get to the bottom
of something. Come on.

41:08.073 --> 41:11.348
Yeah, well, the last guy who kept running
into me accidentally on purpose...

41:11.452 --> 41:13.432
was Maurice, a waiter l bussed for
at a country club.

41:13.537 --> 41:15.728
-You gay, Roy?
-Can't say as l am.

41:15.832 --> 41:17.646
Then why the hell
are you breathing down my neck?

41:17.750 --> 41:19.329
Go live at Tom's. Go live at Tony's.

41:19.502 --> 41:22.609
They have pools in their neighbourhood.
Please get off my block.

41:22.714 --> 41:24.320
Ease this baby a little to the left.

41:24.424 --> 41:26.572
What the hell kind of investigation
is this, anyway?

41:26.676 --> 41:28.965
Are you going to tell me or aren't you?

41:29.220 --> 41:31.677
You're asking all the right questions, Jeff.

41:32.390 --> 41:34.762
Something big is coming down.

41:55.123 --> 41:57.577
-Come on, Dad!
-l'm coming. l'm coming.

42:04.048 --> 42:05.529
Now, look both ways.

42:05.633 --> 42:07.128
l wanna go on the slide!

42:07.302 --> 42:08.381
Me, too! Me, too!

42:31.159 --> 42:35.074
Dad, can you get in trouble with the lRS
if you don't report all of your cash sales?

42:35.664 --> 42:37.657
lt's impossible to report all of them.

42:38.084 --> 42:41.038
-Why? You gonna turn me in?
-Never in a million years.

42:44.883 --> 42:46.959
-Have you ever been arrested?
-No.

42:48.052 --> 42:51.303
-Now, why would you want to know that?
-Just curious.

42:52.098 --> 42:54.288
-That's all.
-Are you trying to tell me something, Jeff?

42:54.392 --> 42:55.851
No. Why?

42:57.312 --> 43:00.977
-What do you mean?
-What's on your mind, Jeff?

43:01.775 --> 43:05.275
-How about everything?
-Can we narrow it down a little bit?

43:05.404 --> 43:09.022
-See, now you're making fun of me.
-Come on, Jeffrey, relax.

43:09.491 --> 43:11.734
Can't worry about the whole world.

43:13.745 --> 43:16.071
Okay, Dad, l'll just stick to our block.

43:30.388 --> 43:32.926
-And it's fruit juice for Mr Morose.
-Thank you.

43:33.683 --> 43:35.343
See you guys in a bit, okay?

43:35.769 --> 43:38.057
-Do you wanna watch the movie?
-No.

43:40.565 --> 43:42.641
Were you troubled at home, Roy?

43:43.235 --> 43:45.026
l had a great home.

43:45.487 --> 43:47.444
l can't imagine you as a kid.

43:48.323 --> 43:50.067
l was a wonderful kid.

43:51.243 --> 43:53.781
-What did your father do?
-A cop.

43:54.120 --> 43:56.031
Good cop or bad cop?

43:56.498 --> 43:57.778
Bad cop.

43:58.458 --> 44:01.377
Wouldn't kiss arse. Good father.

44:02.838 --> 44:05.875
You're making me revise my opinion
of the FBl.

44:16.393 --> 44:17.473
Barbara.

44:18.104 --> 44:20.180
You don't have to say anything.

44:23.193 --> 44:24.391
You love me?

45:40.064 --> 45:42.022
Only two left, Konstantin.

45:42.275 --> 45:45.146
The money, comrade. The money.

46:06.758 --> 46:07.874
Jesus.

46:14.891 --> 46:18.011
-Come on, give me the ball.
-That's 1 1 .

46:20.440 --> 46:24.058
-Don't you have to win by two?
-l already won by four.

46:29.782 --> 46:31.847
-Want something cold to drink?
-What have you got?

46:31.951 --> 46:33.598
Everything. Help yourself.

46:33.702 --> 46:35.862
l got chips to go with that.

46:41.044 --> 46:43.286
Jeffrey Nicholas Grant.

46:43.463 --> 46:46.298
-Well, that sounds official.
-Your parents are Russian spies.

46:48.843 --> 46:51.952
Your parents are KGB agents.
Sleepers, they're called.

46:52.056 --> 46:54.578
Deep cover. They blend
with the country they're assigned to.

46:54.683 --> 46:57.257
Own homes, hold jobs, raise families.

46:57.603 --> 47:01.185
They sleep for years.
But when they awake, they're lethal.

47:01.773 --> 47:05.723
Let's go back to your Air Force Academy
investigation. What happened to that?

47:05.861 --> 47:07.008
What about it?

47:07.112 --> 47:10.778
-What happened to your investigation?
-There wasn't any.

47:12.826 --> 47:15.517
Richard and Elizabeth Grant
entered this country through Canada.

47:15.622 --> 47:18.061
Took their lDs off headstones
in the Spokane Cemetery.

47:18.165 --> 47:19.909
Three years later, you were born.

47:21.002 --> 47:23.125
Wanna see your birth certificate?

47:23.921 --> 47:25.120
No, thanks.

47:28.093 --> 47:30.168
Sure you don't want some chips?

47:32.013 --> 47:37.174
l exist on corn chips and jalapeños.
Not too swift around a stove.

47:39.438 --> 47:42.143
Your dad loved Western music.

47:42.899 --> 47:46.233
Hustled Beatles records
in Central Army Park.

47:46.653 --> 47:49.571
<i>What they call a fartsovsnchi,
a black marketeer.</i>

47:49.990 --> 47:51.733
Can you spell that for me?

47:53.661 --> 47:55.641
He did two years in Lubyanka prison...

47:55.746 --> 47:58.831
then they shipped him to Gaczyna,
KGB's Quantico.

47:59.042 --> 48:01.165
Dad liked Gaczyna better.

48:02.377 --> 48:04.786
-That's where he met Mum.
-l see.

48:06.675 --> 48:09.615
Your mother was a dancer
in the Bolshoi Children's School.

48:09.719 --> 48:12.091
She toured the U.S. when she was 1 7.

48:12.806 --> 48:16.756
Picked up English so fast and so well,
they shipped her to Gaczyna...

48:16.977 --> 48:18.601
American Department.

48:20.480 --> 48:22.389
A marriage was approved.

48:26.820 --> 48:29.393
KGB likes husband-wife teams.

48:36.831 --> 48:38.206
Are you finished?

48:38.958 --> 48:40.416
l'd like to go home.

48:41.043 --> 48:42.122
Go ahead.

48:42.879 --> 48:43.958
Okay.

48:47.884 --> 48:48.963
<i>Hi.</i>

48:50.679 --> 48:51.741
<i>I'm Larry.</i>

48:51.845 --> 48:54.516
<i>This is my brother DarryI,
and my other brother DarryI.</i>

48:55.558 --> 48:57.516
<i>We was over at Peterson's Drugs....</i>

49:01.022 --> 49:03.129
<i>...when we heard
about your impending nuptiaIs.</i>

49:03.233 --> 49:05.107
<i>Which one of us
is going to be your best man?</i>

49:07.320 --> 49:08.400
<i>I'm sorry, guys.</i>

49:08.572 --> 49:10.530
<i>George is going to be my best man.</i>

49:11.575 --> 49:13.614
<i>Me and our coIIective growing.</i>

49:17.164 --> 49:20.188
<i>So we won't hurt your feeIings
by not coming to the wedding?</i>

49:20.292 --> 49:23.910
<i>Gee, I don't know, guys. After
what I've done to you, it'd serve me right.</i>

49:47.737 --> 49:48.817
Hey, Jeff.

50:12.472 --> 50:14.345
<i>HeIIo? HeIIo?</i>

50:14.681 --> 50:15.926
<i>Who is this?</i>

50:25.026 --> 50:27.215
<i>-HeIIo?
-Barbara, l gotta see you.</i>

50:27.319 --> 50:29.760
<i>-What's wrong?
-l'm leaving. l gotta get out of here.</i>

50:29.865 --> 50:32.651
<i>-CaIm down. What's going on?
-l don't know anymore.</i>

50:33.243 --> 50:34.849
<i>-l just want to run away.
-What happened?</i>

50:34.953 --> 50:36.934
<i>-You get another ticket?
-l wish.</i>

50:37.038 --> 50:39.520
Listen, Barbara, will you come with me?

50:39.624 --> 50:42.958
<i>-I can't Ieave now.
-l thought you loved me.</i>

50:43.128 --> 50:45.453
<i>Don't do that. That's not fair.</i>

50:47.341 --> 50:48.571
You're right. l'm sorry.

50:48.675 --> 50:50.835
<i>-Go home, pIease.
-Yeah, l will.</i>

50:51.178 --> 50:52.886
<i>-You promise?
-l do.</i>

50:53.388 --> 50:55.762
Listen, get some rest.

50:56.601 --> 50:57.763
l love you.

51:34.224 --> 51:36.215
You had me there for a moment.

51:45.318 --> 51:47.258
What time will you be home?

51:47.362 --> 51:48.883
5:00, 6:00, something like that.

51:48.987 --> 51:52.654
Could you be a little more specific?
l get tired of cooking dinner twice.

51:53.159 --> 51:55.447
l'm gonna take my truck to the shop, Mum.

51:56.454 --> 51:58.114
Your truck? Again?

51:58.290 --> 52:00.186
lt's my clutch. My clutch is all mushy.

52:00.291 --> 52:01.897
Remember, l told you about it.

52:02.002 --> 52:04.233
-What about it?
-The lining for the clutch.

52:04.337 --> 52:07.153
Brett's gonna do the work for me.
He only needs $50 for the parts.

52:07.257 --> 52:10.128
$50?
l gave you $50 for your truck last month.

52:10.427 --> 52:13.298
-l told you about it, Mum. You said okay.
-l didn't say okay.

52:13.430 --> 52:15.369
You didn't say okay, she said okay.

52:15.474 --> 52:18.165
What are we doing here,
sitting in parliament? Might as well.

52:18.269 --> 52:22.043
Forget the clutch. Forget you promised me.
l'll just strip my gears and scrap my 4x4.

52:22.147 --> 52:23.211
-Hey, hold on.
-l gotta go.

52:23.315 --> 52:25.713
Jeff. You know what it takes
to run that truck of yours?

52:25.818 --> 52:28.633
Do you have any idea
what a teenager's insurance costs?

52:28.737 --> 52:31.194
Do you know what a promise is?

52:32.241 --> 52:33.355
What promise?

52:33.617 --> 52:36.934
-Mum promised me she'd advance me $50.
-Okay, now she's unpromising.

52:37.038 --> 52:40.454
-Dad's right, Jeff. lt wasn't a promise.
-Forget the truth.

52:40.625 --> 52:43.107
-Why bother with the truth?
-Where did that word come from?

52:43.211 --> 52:44.983
Exactly! What's truth got to do with it?

52:45.087 --> 52:47.570
-Truth has no meaning in this house!
-You're yelling, Jeffrey.

52:47.674 --> 52:49.947
l'm not yelling at you, l'm yelling at her.

52:50.052 --> 52:51.866
Lower your voice, Jeff.
Act like a human being.

52:51.970 --> 52:55.077
That's right. l'm an animal.
Well, this animal tells the truth.

52:55.182 --> 52:57.955
All right! Apologise to your mother,
and then you apologise to me.

52:58.060 --> 53:00.041
l will not! You're both liars!

53:00.145 --> 53:02.043
-You watch what you're saying!
-Glad to!

53:02.147 --> 53:04.223
You're both a pair of fucking liars!

53:04.358 --> 53:06.005
Go on, hit the animal.

53:06.109 --> 53:08.780
-Hit the animal. Go on, you....
-Richard, stop, for God's sake!

53:18.288 --> 53:19.867
Go to school, Jeffrey.

53:24.671 --> 53:26.711
Now, here's $40.

53:28.632 --> 53:30.489
lt's all l have until l get to the bank.

53:30.594 --> 53:32.867
l'll leave $10 with Mrs Valdez
in the principal's office.

53:32.971 --> 53:35.745
-l think l got $10.
-lt's okay. lt's okay, Dad. lt's okay, Dad.

53:35.849 --> 53:37.842
You can't go around with a busted clutch.

53:38.101 --> 53:39.975
You'll have an accident.

53:41.980 --> 53:43.474
Here's your lunch.

53:52.115 --> 53:53.196
Thanks.

54:35.702 --> 54:38.988
<i>On your starboard,
notice those cigar shapes over there?</i>

54:39.373 --> 54:43.750
<i>Those aren't cigars, Iadies and gentIemen.
They're nucIear subs.</i>

54:45.254 --> 54:48.042
<i>The big mamas next to them,
they're tenders...</i>

54:48.425 --> 54:52.421
<i>fIoating machine shops that keep
these deadIy defenders of our underseas....</i>

54:53.763 --> 54:55.388
<i>Yes, Iadies and gentIemen.</i>

55:19.039 --> 55:22.490
<i>...ready to take off from a runway
shorter than your high schooI footbaII fieId.</i>

55:27.590 --> 55:29.962
<i>Head for the raiI and take your pictures.</i>

55:30.426 --> 55:35.135
<i>Ladies and gentIemen, the jeweI
of San Diego Bay, the USS Constellation.</i>

55:36.557 --> 55:38.883
<i>Did you check
for personaI beIongings, foIks?</i>

55:39.394 --> 55:42.727
<i>Watch your step up the gangpIank.
Carry on, mates.</i>

55:43.106 --> 55:46.191
<i>Remember to teII your friends
about the SS Margarita.</i>

55:46.318 --> 55:48.891
<i>-Bye, everybody.
-Bye!</i>

55:49.613 --> 55:52.318
Hey, friend, the tour's over.

55:52.532 --> 55:54.847
The next cruise is two hours away.

55:54.952 --> 55:57.100
Are you trying to beat the price of a ticket?

55:57.204 --> 55:59.445
They've tried that before.
lt's not gonna work.

55:59.580 --> 56:01.289
Hey, you hear me?

56:15.848 --> 56:18.683
Dead. Dead.

56:21.103 --> 56:22.183
Dead.

56:23.565 --> 56:24.643
Dead.

56:25.983 --> 56:27.062
Dead.

56:41.917 --> 56:43.031
Jesus.

56:45.212 --> 56:48.663
-l just saw this guy the other day.
-Did he talk with you?

56:49.800 --> 56:50.905
No.

56:51.009 --> 56:52.574
What about your father? Did he talk to him?

56:52.678 --> 56:54.754
No. l don't think he spoke English.

56:56.015 --> 56:58.621
-He just gave us our fish.
-What fish?

56:58.726 --> 57:02.474
The smoked fish.
We traded our catch for the smoked fish.

57:06.860 --> 57:09.549
What do my parents have to do with all this?

57:09.653 --> 57:12.637
You remember l told you about sleepers,
the inactive agents?

57:12.741 --> 57:15.409
They were all sleepers.

57:15.743 --> 57:18.152
Your parents are the only two left.

57:20.374 --> 57:23.992
-Well, who's killing all these people? Us?
-No, of course not.

57:24.461 --> 57:28.874
-A renegade Soviet agent named Scuba.
-This is too much!

57:29.925 --> 57:32.214
What do you want from me?

57:33.137 --> 57:35.295
Stay around the house. Watch them.

57:35.556 --> 57:39.221
Look out for new faces.
Someone has got to contact them.

57:40.144 --> 57:42.101
Spy on my parents?

57:42.688 --> 57:44.515
You've gotta be kidding me.

57:44.648 --> 57:48.860
You want me to help you put them away.
Never!

57:51.114 --> 57:55.241
Look, Jeff, l know it's hard,
but you're going to have to face the facts.

57:55.994 --> 57:59.576
Look, Mr FBl Man,
if you're so sure and if you're so right...

57:59.830 --> 58:01.159
then why don't you arrest them?

58:04.336 --> 58:06.458
Because they haven't done anything yet.

58:07.172 --> 58:10.624
-You manipulating son of a bitch!
-Calm down!

58:11.300 --> 58:13.616
You don't have much choice.
They could be next.

58:13.720 --> 58:14.784
lt wouldn't break your heart.

58:14.888 --> 58:18.371
They're just bait for your Scuba guy, right?
All you care about is nailing him.

58:18.475 --> 58:20.551
You can come and identify the bodies.

58:50.091 --> 58:51.502
Good evening.

58:58.100 --> 59:01.931
We can't help you.
We haven't done anything for 20 years.

59:04.356 --> 59:06.313
l know what you haven't done.

59:06.734 --> 59:11.176
That is precisely
what makes you so valuable right now.

59:11.280 --> 59:13.772
Comrade Karpov, we are at your disposal.

59:14.700 --> 59:18.283
-But we're ill-equipped.
-Just follow the story.

59:19.247 --> 59:21.453
lt's all right there in front of you.

59:23.083 --> 59:27.792
A prick of a thorn and the princess sleeps.

59:28.923 --> 59:31.379
And many years later...

59:31.885 --> 59:34.920
the handsome prince awakens her.

59:35.262 --> 59:36.806
lt's all quite simple.

01:00:35.325 --> 01:00:37.781
lt's a true ensemble, the Kirov.

01:00:39.330 --> 01:00:43.790
l prefer it to the stars of the Bolshoi,
don't you agree, Elizabeth?

01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:19.068
We can't!

01:01:19.662 --> 01:01:22.035
Don't you see? We can't anymore.

01:01:22.791 --> 01:01:26.872
lt's been too long. We can't serve you now.
We're of no use.

01:01:27.546 --> 01:01:28.610
<i>We can't.</i>

01:01:28.714 --> 01:01:32.794
<i>-PIease understand, we can't.
-EIizabeth is understandabIy upset.</i>

01:01:32.968 --> 01:01:34.760
<i>But why be upset?</i>

01:01:35.638 --> 01:01:38.212
You're merely going to pay
a man some money.

01:01:44.730 --> 01:01:45.893
How much money?

01:01:51.904 --> 01:01:54.692
<i>-What kind of man?
-Scuba.</i>

01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:56.029
<i>Who?</i>

01:01:56.285 --> 01:01:59.119
<i>Your oId cIassmate from Gaczyna.</i>

01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:00.746
<i>Gaczyna.</i>

01:02:05.711 --> 01:02:07.502
English.

01:02:12.801 --> 01:02:13.964
<i>EngIish.</i>

01:02:19.558 --> 01:02:20.637
Please.

01:02:21.268 --> 01:02:23.261
l almost forgot.

01:02:24.105 --> 01:02:28.269
l brought you a little something.
From Beriozka.

01:02:29.819 --> 01:02:32.654
The good Beriozka on Gorky Street.

01:02:37.159 --> 01:02:38.489
How is....

01:02:38.704 --> 01:02:40.661
What is his name? Jeff?

01:02:43.749 --> 01:02:45.827
lt's a good likeness, don't you think?

01:03:54.865 --> 01:03:56.064
Don't shoot!

01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:59.404
Ms McLaughlin!

01:04:00.705 --> 01:04:02.533
ls this work experience?

01:04:04.834 --> 01:04:08.038
Go out in the yard. l'll be out in a minute.

01:04:14.261 --> 01:04:17.159
-Life's little surprises.
-No problem.

01:04:17.263 --> 01:04:19.636
l'll just go topless
for the rest of the student body.

01:04:24.271 --> 01:04:25.896
There you go, Judy.

01:04:32.947 --> 01:04:34.109
What are their names?

01:04:37.368 --> 01:04:38.431
lt's not important.

01:04:38.536 --> 01:04:41.027
What are their names?
What are my parents' names?

01:04:43.207 --> 01:04:48.358
Elizabeth Lazarova. Mikhail Stropovich.

01:04:48.462 --> 01:04:49.860
And what's my name?

01:04:49.964 --> 01:04:52.421
-Jeff.
-That's not a Russian name.

01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:54.406
You took a walk tonight, didn't you?

01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:57.346
You found something
you didn't want to find, right?

01:05:06.856 --> 01:05:09.064
Battle of Stalingrad.

01:05:11.237 --> 01:05:13.443
Probably belonged to one of their fathers.

01:05:14.698 --> 01:05:17.368
Pretty common. So many men went down.

01:05:17.785 --> 01:05:20.193
Hey, do l detect a little admiration there?

01:05:20.663 --> 01:05:22.537
For who, your parents? Yeah.

01:05:23.249 --> 01:05:24.363
Why?

01:05:25.543 --> 01:05:26.823
'Cause they had you.

01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:31.086
-Spare me the violins, G-man.
-No violins.

01:05:31.215 --> 01:05:32.446
Just a lot of hard work.

01:05:32.550 --> 01:05:35.123
You gotta be crazy
to bring a child into this ugly world.

01:05:35.261 --> 01:05:39.119
-What's so hard about it?
-Making a buck. Raising a family.

01:05:39.223 --> 01:05:42.973
Keeping it all together takes talent. Love.

01:05:47.733 --> 01:05:49.393
Put these back where you found them.

01:05:50.652 --> 01:05:52.062
Back to business, huh?

01:05:52.655 --> 01:05:54.149
G-man's onto something big.

01:05:55.074 --> 01:05:56.804
l'm trying to look out for you.

01:05:56.908 --> 01:05:59.182
Don't give me that crap!
You're out for yourself!

01:05:59.286 --> 01:06:03.018
The big collar. The major bust.
The two-bit G-man will shove it up your ass!

01:06:03.123 --> 01:06:04.187
Hey, hey, easy.

01:06:04.291 --> 01:06:05.702
You're not my father.

01:06:07.086 --> 01:06:08.829
You're not even my friend.

01:06:43.707 --> 01:06:46.280
-Now we have to tell him.
-No. No.

01:06:47.377 --> 01:06:48.540
lt would destroy him.

01:06:48.713 --> 01:06:51.286
You're wrong. He would understand.
l know he would.

01:06:51.590 --> 01:06:52.988
We must send him away.

01:06:53.092 --> 01:06:54.966
-Where?
-l don't know.

01:06:55.761 --> 01:06:58.494
We should call Bill,
have him put everything in Jeff's name.

01:06:58.599 --> 01:06:59.760
lt always was.

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:03.686
-You knew this would happen?
-We both did.

01:07:05.771 --> 01:07:08.856
l'll never regret it. We had Jeff.

01:07:10.235 --> 01:07:11.610
l don't think it's over.

01:07:12.487 --> 01:07:14.444
Yes, it is.

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:17.991
-lt can never be the same.
-We could run with Jeff.

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:20.110
lt wouldn't be fair to him.

01:07:21.539 --> 01:07:23.615
He has his whole life ahead of him.

01:07:29.130 --> 01:07:30.291
We have to tell him.

01:07:33.926 --> 01:07:37.211
He probably wouldn't believe us.

01:07:38.973 --> 01:07:40.633
How could he?

01:07:59.703 --> 01:08:03.320
Hi, Mum. Hi, Dad. How was the ballet?

01:08:04.332 --> 01:08:06.409
-Very nice.
-Dad?

01:08:06.752 --> 01:08:08.210
Yeah. lt was very nice.

01:08:08.962 --> 01:08:11.632
Well, l think l'll turn in.

01:08:12.258 --> 01:08:15.839
-How's the new clutch?
-Great.

01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:20.636
Here, l almost forgot your change.

01:08:30.109 --> 01:08:31.568
What's my name?

01:08:33.779 --> 01:08:35.024
Come on, Dad.

01:08:35.490 --> 01:08:37.638
What could the head of the Grant family
have to hide...

01:08:37.742 --> 01:08:39.899
from his first and oldest and only son?

01:08:42.705 --> 01:08:44.200
What's my name?

01:08:47.126 --> 01:08:48.323
Nika.

01:08:52.924 --> 01:08:55.594
J. Nicholas Grant. Nick.

01:08:59.721 --> 01:09:00.969
Nikita.

01:09:08.691 --> 01:09:09.935
Hello.

01:09:10.318 --> 01:09:12.725
Your moment has come.

01:09:13.863 --> 01:09:15.854
<i>I toId you we're not ready.</i>

01:09:16.698 --> 01:09:19.107
You've had 20 years to get ready.

01:09:20.368 --> 01:09:22.243
-Who is it?
-lt's him.

01:09:22.371 --> 01:09:25.041
-Let's get out of here.
-lt's too late.

01:09:26.667 --> 01:09:29.504
-How about if you give us time?
-Hang up the phone.

01:09:29.712 --> 01:09:32.528
-How can we prevail?
-For God's sake, Dad!

01:09:32.631 --> 01:09:34.256
We beseech you!

01:09:35.135 --> 01:09:37.506
Your discipline is sorely wanting.

01:09:37.886 --> 01:09:39.928
The directorate will be most unhappy.

01:09:40.599 --> 01:09:43.054
You must go to work immediately.

01:09:43.184 --> 01:09:44.643
And if we don't?

01:09:45.770 --> 01:09:47.680
lf we choose not to?

01:09:48.481 --> 01:09:52.549
lf we have the strength to turn our back
on Elizabeth's father and my mother?

01:09:52.653 --> 01:09:53.982
Roy!

01:09:54.821 --> 01:09:55.901
Roy!

01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:59.989
Roy.

01:10:02.121 --> 01:10:03.200
Roy!

01:10:03.915 --> 01:10:06.870
You have neither the strength
nor the choice.

01:10:07.627 --> 01:10:09.335
<i>They are both dead.</i>

01:10:12.006 --> 01:10:14.213
<i>-Our parents are dead?
-Yes.</i>

01:10:16.844 --> 01:10:20.889
And to answer your next question,
of old age.

01:10:21.516 --> 01:10:24.304
-Roy!
-Now are you ready to proceed?

01:10:25.688 --> 01:10:27.229
-Roy!
-Give me your answer.

01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:28.711
<i>The answer is no.</i>

01:10:28.815 --> 01:10:32.813
Roy! Come on, where are you? lt's me, Jeff!

01:10:33.653 --> 01:10:36.324
Then we will have to skip a generation.

01:10:36.532 --> 01:10:37.611
Roy!

01:10:43.289 --> 01:10:45.364
Come in, Nikita. Sit down.

01:10:49.796 --> 01:10:51.539
Oh, my God!

01:10:51.923 --> 01:10:55.007
<i>No, not God. Just Nikita.</i>

01:10:56.094 --> 01:10:59.545
<i>You wiII make contact this morning at 5.:30.</i>

01:10:59.847 --> 01:11:02.803
<i>MeanwhiIe, Nikita and I
wiII keep each other company.</i>

01:11:02.935 --> 01:11:04.214
Please.

01:11:05.103 --> 01:11:07.676
Please, Konstantin lvanovich...

01:11:08.107 --> 01:11:11.309
l beg of you. Leave Jeff!

01:11:12.193 --> 01:11:15.563
<i>-Anything you say.
-You have heard what I said.</i>

01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:20.318
<i>5.:30 a.m., the G Street Pier.
You give him the money.</i>

01:11:22.121 --> 01:11:26.201
The boy is charming.
He looks just like his mother.

01:11:31.631 --> 01:11:33.670
You speak Russian, Nikita?

01:11:35.342 --> 01:11:38.012
No. And the name's Jeff.

01:11:38.596 --> 01:11:39.711
Jeff?

01:11:41.058 --> 01:11:43.974
To me, you are Nikita. And l am Konstantin.

01:11:44.811 --> 01:11:49.272
<i>You may call me tovarich.
lt's our Russian word for ''friend.''</i>

01:11:52.528 --> 01:11:54.816
Do you have another cigarette, Konstantin?

01:11:55.613 --> 01:12:00.027
You smoke, Nikita?
What would the Surgeon General say?

01:12:03.706 --> 01:12:05.284
Russian cigarettes.

01:12:06.833 --> 01:12:09.408
You will acquire the taste, Nikita.

01:12:10.379 --> 01:12:12.668
As you will for all things Russian.

01:12:15.551 --> 01:12:18.636
l once had some Popov Vodka.

01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:24.340
Did you? Bully for you, Nikita! What a guy!

01:12:27.563 --> 01:12:29.686
On your feet. We're leaving.

01:12:39.701 --> 01:12:42.240
-Where are you going?
-To the bathroom.

01:12:49.253 --> 01:12:52.289
You have a weak bladder, Nikita?

01:12:53.591 --> 01:12:54.966
Come again, Konstantin?

01:12:56.927 --> 01:12:58.006
Go.

01:12:58.638 --> 01:13:00.595
Make it snappy.

01:13:02.850 --> 01:13:04.558
Leave the door open.

01:13:15.531 --> 01:13:17.772
Stick this up your bladder, Boris.

01:13:30.003 --> 01:13:31.248
Let's go.

01:15:23.204 --> 01:15:25.327
-Karpov?
-He's got him!

01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:27.414
-You're next.
-You stay out of it!

01:15:27.958 --> 01:15:30.065
You're the bait. Karpov wants Scuba.

01:15:30.170 --> 01:15:31.961
We want Jeff.

01:15:33.006 --> 01:15:34.085
Alive!

01:15:35.133 --> 01:15:36.405
You've got to take me with you.

01:15:36.509 --> 01:15:38.032
-You need me!
-Step aside.

01:15:38.136 --> 01:15:40.011
The payoff is a trap!

01:15:40.472 --> 01:15:41.717
Here's the passports.

01:15:41.931 --> 01:15:43.704
He wants money. Karpov wants him.

01:15:43.808 --> 01:15:46.249
lf Scuba doesn't like the rendezvous,
you are next.

01:15:46.354 --> 01:15:48.709
-We'll take that chance.
-What do you think your odds are?

01:15:48.813 --> 01:15:51.254
He'll kill you! He'll kill anybody!

01:15:51.359 --> 01:15:53.381
-Okay?
-Okay, okay, what?

01:15:53.485 --> 01:15:56.885
-You tell me where the rendezvous is, okay?
-Okay, what?

01:15:56.989 --> 01:15:58.262
-What?
-You're not his father!

01:15:58.366 --> 01:16:00.554
Hey, hey, you got to trust me.

01:16:00.659 --> 01:16:03.780
Wait! Wait! Stop this damn truck!

01:16:35.071 --> 01:16:37.643
<i>-...is no.
-Roy!</i>

01:16:44.663 --> 01:16:47.534
<i>Come in, Nikita. Sit down.</i>

01:16:48.292 --> 01:16:50.035
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

01:16:50.335 --> 01:16:52.495
You are entering the United States illegally.

01:18:40.951 --> 01:18:43.109
Out! Out, out, out!

01:19:04.767 --> 01:19:07.803
No more of the monkey business! Drive!

01:20:56.299 --> 01:21:00.158
Come, come. Come, come. We go, we go.

01:21:00.263 --> 01:21:05.339
<i>WeIcome aboard the San Diego troIIey,
bound for San Ysidro InternationaI Border.</i>

01:21:07.102 --> 01:21:08.430
Go! Go, go, go!

01:21:23.203 --> 01:21:24.317
Up there.

01:21:46.643 --> 01:21:48.303
Where the hell is he?

01:22:00.907 --> 01:22:01.988
Richard!

01:22:04.578 --> 01:22:05.657
Jeff!

01:23:17.737 --> 01:23:19.510
-Richard, there it is! Over there!
-All right.

01:23:19.614 --> 01:23:21.690
-l see it! All right, all right!
-Faster! Faster!

01:23:50.021 --> 01:23:51.099
Richard!

01:23:57.612 --> 01:23:59.176
<i>Your attention, pIease.</i>

01:23:59.281 --> 01:24:04.348
<i>I'd Iike to remind aII passengers there is no
smoking, drinking, or eating permitted...</i>

01:24:04.453 --> 01:24:06.309
<i>whiIe onboard the troIIey.</i>

01:24:06.413 --> 01:24:08.870
<i>And in consideration to other passengers...</i>

01:24:09.083 --> 01:24:12.332
<i>pIease do not pIace your feet on the seats.
Thank you.</i>

01:24:59.385 --> 01:25:01.424
Take a seat, please. Please.

01:25:08.727 --> 01:25:12.511
We did our best. Don't take our son.

01:25:13.273 --> 01:25:15.314
lt wasn't good enough.

01:25:15.652 --> 01:25:17.312
Take us.

01:25:17.612 --> 01:25:20.697
But you are of no use to me
in Russia, Mikhail.

01:25:22.158 --> 01:25:25.526
<i>Our next station is Byer. Byer is next.</i>

01:25:30.667 --> 01:25:33.399
Anybody got any change?
Anybody got any change?

01:25:33.503 --> 01:25:35.651
Hey, how about you, lady? You got change?

01:25:35.756 --> 01:25:39.125
Anybody, change?
How about you guys, you got any change?

01:25:39.259 --> 01:25:41.783
Hey, how about you guys?
You look like buddies.

01:25:41.887 --> 01:25:44.010
Do you want to chip in together
to make change for me?

01:25:45.557 --> 01:25:47.846
<i>That's okay, hombre, l'll manage.</i>

01:25:48.353 --> 01:25:49.762
Don't move, folks.

01:25:50.187 --> 01:25:51.847
Everybody, steady.

01:26:00.031 --> 01:26:01.229
Konstantin.

01:26:01.783 --> 01:26:03.407
Roy, my friend.

01:26:04.285 --> 01:26:08.781
l lost you. 1967, Union Station.

01:26:11.877 --> 01:26:15.660
And now we have found each other.

01:26:16.214 --> 01:26:17.625
On the trolley.

01:26:19.509 --> 01:26:21.882
A chance encounter of old friends.

01:26:25.682 --> 01:26:30.095
You bring me my assignment.
What a friendly gesture.

01:26:32.189 --> 01:26:34.561
No? Did l presume too much?

01:26:36.235 --> 01:26:37.777
Of course, of course.

01:26:39.531 --> 01:26:40.858
l am mistaken.

01:26:42.616 --> 01:26:44.409
You hold all the cards.

01:26:46.246 --> 01:26:50.457
And all l have is a 1 7-year-old boy.

01:26:56.089 --> 01:26:57.548
Get up, Jeff.

01:27:01.553 --> 01:27:02.668
How?

01:27:03.013 --> 01:27:04.922
Like you always did, kid.

01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:08.805
What are you laughing at, scum?

01:27:16.109 --> 01:27:17.817
What did he say?

01:27:18.654 --> 01:27:22.070
''How can you let me go
after l killed your friend?''

01:27:22.241 --> 01:27:25.277
No, not friend, partner.

01:27:30.499 --> 01:27:33.251
-He tried to be--
-l heard what he said.

01:27:33.837 --> 01:27:37.750
''He tried to be a hero, he ended up a fool.''

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:51.931
You heard me, kid.

01:27:53.273 --> 01:27:56.476
Plant your feet and rise. Now!

01:28:08.706 --> 01:28:11.078
On your feet, shithead! On your feet!

01:28:16.505 --> 01:28:19.792
All right, Jeff, cross the aisle...

01:28:21.343 --> 01:28:24.760
nice and slow.

01:28:33.439 --> 01:28:36.145
l would never give up a man
who killed my partner.

01:28:39.071 --> 01:28:41.822
You never had a partner.

01:28:49.623 --> 01:28:51.451
l like you, Roy.

01:29:00.259 --> 01:29:03.951
<i>Out Iast station

01:29:04.055 --> 01:29:07.470
<i>AII returning passengers are reminded

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:30.841
You stay here!

01:30:33.147 --> 01:30:34.544
You stay out of this!

01:30:34.648 --> 01:30:37.465
Come on. You walk in front of us, kid,
and hide this mess.

01:30:37.569 --> 01:30:39.608
-No! No!
-You don't want the cops here, do you?

01:30:44.618 --> 01:30:45.696
Jeffrey!

01:31:22.199 --> 01:31:24.190
Nikita, l'm going to miss you.

01:31:25.117 --> 01:31:29.863
We could have had such a pleasant trip
together. Come visit me sometime.

01:31:30.664 --> 01:31:33.453
And, by all means, bring Barbara with you.

01:31:52.187 --> 01:31:54.062
Goodbye, Mr Parmenter.

01:31:56.233 --> 01:31:58.107

01:32:20.758 --> 01:32:22.087
You know, Roy...

01:32:23.887 --> 01:32:26.377
Russians don't shoot their children.

01:33:15.774 --> 01:33:18.977
-What's new, Roy?
-Nothing much.

01:33:19.945 --> 01:33:22.021
-Tamales and cockfights.
-Yeah, l know.

01:33:22.406 --> 01:33:25.241
-Same old, same old.
-Same old, same old.

01:33:48.224 --> 01:33:50.134
Let's go home.
