WEBVTT

00:03.112 --> 00:06.042
Mnh. God, I'm gonna go down
a full shoe size after this.

00:09.924 --> 00:12.558
Yeah, not bad.

00:12.560 --> 00:14.360
<i>- Hola!</i>
- Hey!

00:14.362 --> 00:16.077
- Hi! Hello!
<i>- Hola.</i>

00:16.088 --> 00:17.769
I was just cleaning up my bunions.

00:17.780 --> 00:19.620
I think that's actually
a callus. Right, girl?

00:19.631 --> 00:20.896
It's staring at me.

00:20.907 --> 00:22.851
- It's really good to see you, though.
- You too!

00:22.862 --> 00:24.970
- Man, I love when you come here.
- Oh, me too.

00:24.972 --> 00:27.072
- Mwah! Mwah!
- Ah!

00:27.074 --> 00:28.407
Love seeing you. Mwah!

00:28.409 --> 00:30.041
- Mwah!
- Oh.

00:30.043 --> 00:31.310
So many kisses.

00:31.312 --> 00:32.400
Oh, my gosh. Hello.

00:32.411 --> 00:33.978
Missed you. You too, baby.

00:33.989 --> 00:36.191
Look. I brought you some
hydrangeas from my garden.

00:36.202 --> 00:38.943
- Flowers?! In a vase?!
- Mmm!

00:38.954 --> 00:41.210
New Jersey Hydrangeas! Hello!

00:41.221 --> 00:42.944
Okay, what are you guys up to today?

00:42.955 --> 00:45.366
'Cause I could really use
some help tackling my ingrowns.

00:45.377 --> 00:46.965
It's honestly a three-person job.

00:46.976 --> 00:48.609
I would love to. I would.

00:48.611 --> 00:50.544
But we're going actually
to the Javits Center

00:50.546 --> 00:52.413
- to see a big car show.
- What?!

00:52.415 --> 00:54.015
Here we come!
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom!

00:54.017 --> 00:56.950
Ah, so I'm gonna go change.
Feel free to chill here.

00:56.952 --> 00:59.219
No peeking, okay? Go away.

00:59.221 --> 01:01.955
Johnny, would you be a
pal and towel me up?

01:01.957 --> 01:03.456
- I'm a little raw!
- Yeah.

01:03.458 --> 01:06.493
Whoa! Watch out! You got to use the
tongs so you don't burn yourself.

01:06.495 --> 01:08.929
- My feet are raw, girl. Yikes.
- Ahh.

01:08.931 --> 01:10.731
- There you go. Yeah.
- Thank you.

01:10.733 --> 01:12.866
Okay, so, how's it freakin' going?

01:12.868 --> 01:15.803
Really good. I actually
just redid my kitchen.

01:15.805 --> 01:18.471
But isn't your landlord gonna,
like, wreck you for that?

01:18.473 --> 01:20.340
Goodbye Credit Karma or whatever?

01:20.342 --> 01:23.510
I own my apartment,
so I think I'll be all right.

01:23.512 --> 01:25.445
That is so insane.

01:25.447 --> 01:27.881
I forgot-slash-didn't really
know that was an option.

01:27.883 --> 01:32.519
You are so mature and adult.
I love you two together.

01:32.521 --> 01:36.690
Ooh! And I love that outfit!

01:36.692 --> 01:38.559
- Look at you!
<i>- Gracias.</i>

01:38.561 --> 01:40.394
No, it's just an old handkerchief

01:40.396 --> 01:41.678
I found lying around.

01:41.689 --> 01:43.497
That old thing?

01:43.499 --> 01:46.333
You know, Jaimé, I'm, like,
smelling something funky.

01:46.335 --> 01:48.968
I feel like the apartment smells
funkier than usual in here.

01:48.970 --> 01:50.671
<i>Mi amora,</i> I don't mean to be mean,

01:50.673 --> 01:52.900
but I think it's your disgusting feet.

01:52.911 --> 01:54.444
- Okay.
- Like, I can taste it.

01:54.455 --> 01:55.841
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

01:55.843 --> 01:58.077
And I don't want you guys
to be scared to come back.

01:58.088 --> 02:00.216
It's gonna... My tootsies
are gonna be fresh to death

02:00.227 --> 02:02.383
by the time you get back,
if you choose to come back.

02:02.394 --> 02:04.284
Okay. Give me a squeeze. I'm gonna go.

02:04.286 --> 02:05.818
- All right. Mwah!
- Love you, baby.

02:05.820 --> 02:07.453
- Have fun at the show.
- Mm, bye.

02:07.455 --> 02:09.755
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!

02:09.757 --> 02:12.625
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! And...

02:17.844 --> 02:21.115
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -

02:21.869 --> 02:24.770
Okay, folks, let's talk
about this month's aesthetic.

02:24.772 --> 02:26.805
As you know, the theme is...

02:26.807 --> 02:29.107
birds... again.

02:29.109 --> 02:31.009
Um, the window has to be awesome.

02:31.011 --> 02:33.546
It wants to make the customer
feel like they can just walk in

02:33.548 --> 02:36.715
and maybe, as they get in here,
they might just take flight.

02:36.717 --> 02:39.061
I think we should start
with a huge bird on the back.

02:39.072 --> 02:40.628
I think that could be our feature,

02:40.639 --> 02:42.120
and we can just pull it all...

02:42.122 --> 02:45.080
Oh, totally! I love that idea!

02:45.091 --> 02:47.493
Ti... It's timeless. And... and timely.

02:47.495 --> 02:50.962
Time's Up, right?

02:50.964 --> 02:53.699
Anyway, I happen to have an idea
for next month's window display,

02:53.701 --> 02:55.378
and I was like, "I should share it!"

02:55.389 --> 02:57.102
This is, like, a cool
corporate environment

02:57.113 --> 02:59.271
where I should share my ideas
when I get them, right?

02:59.273 --> 03:01.206
So, I've been really inspired lately

03:01.208 --> 03:02.975
by Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue."

03:02.977 --> 03:05.177
It would be, like, a great way to, like,

03:05.179 --> 03:07.878
really tribute classic New York City.
Like, we...

03:07.889 --> 03:09.648
Ma'am, where can I find that shirt?

03:09.650 --> 03:12.250
Okay, you can call me "miss,"
and this guy right here

03:12.252 --> 03:14.708
is gonna be around the corner
at the bottom of the stairs.

03:14.719 --> 03:17.189
But if you hit the vanity
made of vintage teacups,

03:17.191 --> 03:18.791
you've gone too far.

03:18.793 --> 03:20.793
Okay, so, picture this display, right?

03:20.795 --> 03:24.096
It's a beautiful cityscape
made of instruments.

03:26.224 --> 03:27.824
I... I think that it would be

03:27.835 --> 03:30.270
a really incredible way
to show the melody of the city.

03:30.281 --> 03:32.616
- Ma'am, where can I find the, um...
- ... the smelly sticks?

03:32.627 --> 03:34.039
Mm. You can call me "miss."

03:34.041 --> 03:37.342
And you call the smelly sticks
"sage smudging wands,"

03:37.344 --> 03:39.378
and they're gonna be
over there in the corner,

03:39.380 --> 03:43.649
right next to the robin's nest
Caucasian headdresses.

03:43.651 --> 03:48.520
I would be honored to lead this project.

03:48.522 --> 03:52.157
You're not ready yet.
Just doesn't happen overnight.

03:52.159 --> 03:54.226
Plus, you're an amazing sales associate!

03:54.228 --> 03:56.395
I c... I can't afford to lose you
from the floor.

03:56.397 --> 03:57.796
Okay. Yeah.

03:57.798 --> 03:59.298
- Okay?
- Thank you.

03:59.300 --> 04:00.932
I'm gonna go sa... I'm gonna go sell.

04:00.934 --> 04:02.901
- Great sales associate.
- Love it.

04:02.903 --> 04:04.603
Yes. Right. As I was saying...

04:06.000 --> 04:12.074

04:39.706 --> 04:43.307
Aaaah!

04:50.050 --> 04:51.482
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:51.484 --> 04:53.551
Dude, thank God. Thank God you're here.

04:53.553 --> 04:56.187
- What is going on in here?
- Okay.

04:56.189 --> 04:59.274
A long time ago, I promised Jaimé
I would never enter his room.

04:59.285 --> 05:01.550
Okay, wait. Sorry. The whole
time that you've lived here,

05:01.561 --> 05:03.609
you've never gone
in Jaimé's room before?

05:03.620 --> 05:04.996
Correct. He asked me not to,

05:04.998 --> 05:07.298
so I wasn't about to be another
greedy-ass white person

05:07.300 --> 05:09.716
who thinks they're owed dominion over
every single brown person's territory.

05:09.727 --> 05:11.622
Who do you think I am,
some sort of Christina Columbus?

05:11.633 --> 05:13.270
No, no, I... I don't think that.

05:13.272 --> 05:15.572
Okay, but then today
I smelled a smell so bad,

05:15.574 --> 05:17.274
it was the stench of death.

05:17.276 --> 05:18.783
And I just had to look in his room.

05:18.794 --> 05:20.711
And that's when I discovered...

05:20.713 --> 05:22.479
What?

05:22.481 --> 05:24.548
Dude, what did you discover?

05:26.518 --> 05:29.486
Okay. I need to warn you.
It's really, really bad.

05:29.488 --> 05:31.855
Like, have you ever seen
"American Psycho"?

05:31.857 --> 05:33.757
- Yeah.
- Or "Sicario"?

05:33.759 --> 05:35.358
No, I didn't see that.

05:35.360 --> 05:37.360
Or Matt Damon try to talk
about sexual assault?

05:37.362 --> 05:39.830
'Cause this is worse.

05:54.279 --> 05:57.413
Jaimé is a hoarder.

06:19.563 --> 06:22.363
Ilana, I think I found the source!

06:22.365 --> 06:25.166
Whew! Ugh! Ugh. I smell it.

06:25.168 --> 06:26.701
Okay, now I know he's crazy.

06:26.703 --> 06:29.668
I mean, who doesn't finish an
everything bagel with cream cheese?

06:29.679 --> 06:31.292
Okay, Abbi, we don't call people "crazy"

06:31.303 --> 06:34.209
- 'cause it stigmatizes mental illness.
- Yeah, okay.

06:34.211 --> 06:37.345
Maybe he meant to finish it,
but then it fell behind...

06:37.347 --> 06:38.813
this tube of rocks?

06:38.815 --> 06:42.050
- Oh, my God.
- But he didn't notice the smell?

06:42.052 --> 06:45.553
Abbi, denial ain't
just a river in, um...

06:48.024 --> 06:49.590
He's in denial.

06:56.098 --> 06:58.366
Oh, God. I could not have
done this without you.

06:58.368 --> 07:00.468
Thank you so much for
leaving work for this.

07:00.470 --> 07:02.737
Yeah, it's not like
they even need me there.

07:02.739 --> 07:04.972
I told Lisa about the
window-display idea,

07:04.974 --> 07:07.575
and she was like,
"You're just not ready."

07:07.577 --> 07:10.010
Ugh! She cannot talk to you like that.

07:10.012 --> 07:11.645
She's not the boss of you.

07:11.647 --> 07:14.682
I mean, she literally is the
boss of me. She's my boss.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.585
Wait. It is, like, so cuckoo

07:17.587 --> 07:20.153
that Jaimé kept all my psych
textbooks from college.

07:20.155 --> 07:22.556
- Yeah.
- Like, what?

07:22.558 --> 07:24.224
Oh, my God. Hoarding.

07:24.226 --> 07:25.993
Okay.

07:25.995 --> 07:29.129
"A person who suffers from hoarding
experiences extreme distress

07:29.131 --> 07:31.665
at the thought of discarding
of their valued items."

07:33.435 --> 07:35.169
- Uh, Doy-ee!
- Got it.

07:35.171 --> 07:37.437
Make you buy the book.
Duh! We're, like...

07:37.439 --> 07:39.106
We... We know.

07:39.108 --> 07:41.976
All right. I'm gonna skip ahead
to the, uh, treatment section.

07:41.978 --> 07:43.948
Okay, yeah, let's see
what they have to say, huh?

07:43.959 --> 07:47.647
"Treatment... absolutely never,
ever, under any circumstances...

07:47.649 --> 07:52.452
m-move the hoarder's
possessions without them."

08:02.164 --> 08:05.399
- All right. Think it matches?
- Close enough, right?

08:05.401 --> 08:07.033
So good you took this photo, dude.

08:07.035 --> 08:10.069
Oh, my God, I needed to.
My mother lives for this shit.

08:10.080 --> 08:11.820
Whenever she's on a diet
and needs to stop herself

08:11.831 --> 08:13.743
from eating, she just
Googles hoarder photos.

08:13.754 --> 08:15.609
Loses her appetite immediately.

08:20.616 --> 08:22.516
Hi. What? Hello.

08:22.518 --> 08:23.917
Welcome.

08:23.919 --> 08:27.220
Jaimé, Johnny, please take a seat.

08:28.323 --> 08:31.224
Okay. <i>Hola,</i> Abbi.

08:31.226 --> 08:33.693
Hi. Hey.

08:33.696 --> 08:36.462
- Wait. I think I'm gonna go.
- No!

08:36.465 --> 08:38.602
You helped me decorate my whole office.

08:38.613 --> 08:40.133
You don't want to see
the magic happen in it?

08:40.144 --> 08:41.929
Okay, listen, I thought
that I could do this,

08:41.940 --> 08:43.549
but when my parents got divorced,

08:43.561 --> 08:44.994
I had to go through a lot of therapy,

08:44.996 --> 08:47.129
and this is actually
very triggering for me.

08:47.131 --> 08:48.807
I'm not good with therapy.

08:48.818 --> 08:53.021
Okay. If you stay, you can
have some of the cheese.

08:53.371 --> 08:56.939
Ilana. W-What the hell is going on?

08:56.950 --> 09:00.431
Okay, so, before we begin,
I want to assure you

09:00.442 --> 09:03.670
I would never share
what happens in this room

09:03.681 --> 09:05.314
with anybody in my personal life.

09:05.316 --> 09:07.416
But is that because, like,
most of the people

09:07.418 --> 09:09.805
in your personal life are,
like, in this room right now?

09:09.816 --> 09:11.019
Mm. So true.

09:11.030 --> 09:14.556
See, we are already making some
excellent discoveries here.

09:14.558 --> 09:16.571
I'm just gonna write this down.

09:16.582 --> 09:19.760
Where'd you get that?
Did... Did you go in my room?

09:19.771 --> 09:22.623
I-I'm sorry, but this is what
I wanted to talk to you about.

09:22.634 --> 09:26.269
That I-I know that you're a h-hoarder.

09:26.358 --> 09:27.891
- What?
- I'm sorry, okay?

09:27.893 --> 09:29.937
- It... It's okay. We love you.
- We love you.

09:29.948 --> 09:31.648
And we just want to help. Okay?

09:31.659 --> 09:33.921
I had to go in your room
because I smelled

09:33.932 --> 09:36.433
what I thought could
only be the stench of death.

09:36.435 --> 09:38.468
But then I later discovered
it was an unfinished

09:38.470 --> 09:40.270
everything bagel with cream cheese,

09:40.272 --> 09:42.573
which... no judgment... is way worse.

09:42.575 --> 09:44.774
- Who doesn't finish an everything bagel?
- Right?

09:44.776 --> 09:47.310
I am not playing this little game, okay?

09:47.312 --> 09:48.711
And don't go into my room again.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.746
- Jaimé.
- Jaimé. Jaimé, wait. Hold on.

09:50.748 --> 09:52.715
Hold on a second. Come here.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.751
Here, babe. It's okay.

10:11.403 --> 10:12.768
I think it's going well.

10:12.770 --> 10:14.370
- Really good.
- Yeah.

10:27.785 --> 10:30.886
Hold on. Ilana, are you
using the same cheese grater

10:30.888 --> 10:32.888
on the cheese that
you're using on your feet?

10:32.890 --> 10:35.724
Yeah. Okay. Let's dig in. Welcome back.

10:35.726 --> 10:37.560
Okay, but just so you know,
it's not that

10:37.562 --> 10:39.562
I'm not still mad
about you going into my room.

10:39.564 --> 10:41.897
- Not cool. Very not cool.
- Totally not cool.

10:41.899 --> 10:44.266
I'm glad that you're
honoring your instincts.

10:44.268 --> 10:46.268
And good for you for setting boundaries.

10:46.270 --> 10:48.470
I just want you to explore your feelings

10:48.472 --> 10:50.105
in a judgment-free zone, okay?

10:50.107 --> 10:51.640
This is a safe space.

10:53.277 --> 10:54.638
Well, not literally safe.

10:54.649 --> 10:56.614
How about we start with
looking at the most common

10:56.625 --> 10:59.081
causes of hoarding and see if
you connect with any of them?

10:59.083 --> 11:00.849
Now, I don't want to
put words in your mouth,

11:00.851 --> 11:04.419
but hoarding often develops
as a coping mechanism

11:04.421 --> 11:07.056
for a feeling of a lack of control.

11:07.058 --> 11:08.891
Does that resonate with you?

11:08.893 --> 11:10.659
W-Well, obviously,
before I became a citizen,

11:10.661 --> 11:12.761
you know, I was always
so anxious about my status.

11:12.763 --> 11:14.997
And, you know, you feel
this lack of control.

11:14.999 --> 11:16.598
- Very powerless, you know?
- Mm.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.389
That's really when it started
to all pile up.

11:18.400 --> 11:19.668
Okay, I-I'm sorry to interrupt.

11:19.670 --> 11:21.970
I'm still feeling very
uncomfortable in general,

11:21.972 --> 11:23.772
and I'm also starting to feel ill,

11:23.774 --> 11:25.373
probably because I've been eating cheese

11:25.375 --> 11:26.842
that's mixed in with your heel skin.

11:26.844 --> 11:28.370
I'm... I'm so sorry that my emotions

11:28.381 --> 11:29.711
are making you this uncomfortable.

11:29.713 --> 11:32.781
I love you and support you.
This is about Ilana's feet.

11:32.783 --> 11:34.783
One moment, please. Abbi, relax.

11:34.785 --> 11:37.085
I put the grater in Barbicide
after I use it on my feet.

11:37.087 --> 11:38.519
Do you think I'm an idiot?

11:38.521 --> 11:40.521
Barbicide?

11:40.523 --> 11:44.125
Okay, so, what I'm sensing
is that the hoarding...

11:44.127 --> 11:46.795
Provides a sense of comfort
in times of stress.

11:46.797 --> 11:49.230
It's gotten a lot worse lately,
to be honest, and I don't...

11:49.232 --> 11:50.598
I don't know why, 'cause I...

11:50.600 --> 11:52.500
I really have been so happy with you.

11:52.502 --> 11:54.002
I know you have, babe.

11:54.004 --> 11:56.404
You know, I often encounter in my work

11:56.406 --> 12:00.075
people struggling with the
duality of relationships.

12:00.077 --> 12:01.509
You know, maybe there's something

12:01.511 --> 12:03.310
about this relationship,

12:03.312 --> 12:06.881
even if it's going dopely,
that's causing anxiety.

12:06.883 --> 12:09.216
I'm sorry, but, Ilana, do I
have to go to the hospital?

12:09.218 --> 12:10.450
Oh, my God.

12:10.452 --> 12:12.519
Okay, you are wasting Jaimé's hour.

12:12.521 --> 12:15.656
Okay? This is so unprofessional!
I'll handle it, okay?

13:06.241 --> 13:08.374
Okay, dude, just be honest with me.

13:08.376 --> 13:10.743
Did I or did I not eat your foot cheese?

13:10.745 --> 13:13.213
What part of "I put the cheese
grater in Barbicide"

13:13.215 --> 13:15.315
before it touches the cheese"
do you not understand?

13:15.317 --> 13:16.849
And not for nothing, you're probably

13:16.851 --> 13:18.827
lactose-intolerant 'cause
you're an Ashkenazi Jew.

13:18.838 --> 13:20.400
Or maybe you didn't know that. Okay?

13:20.411 --> 13:22.397
And have you never sucked
on a couple toes before?

13:22.408 --> 13:24.057
- I have sucked on toes.
- Really?

13:24.059 --> 13:25.725
- Yeah.
- Because you're lucky, girl.

13:25.727 --> 13:28.761
A lot of people pay good money
for my foot shavings.

13:28.763 --> 13:30.664
They do?

13:30.666 --> 13:32.499
Ooh! Look at these two.

13:32.501 --> 13:34.967
Am I good, or am I good?

13:34.969 --> 13:37.370
All right, that is about all
the time we have for this week.

13:37.372 --> 13:39.490
Actually, we went a little bit
over, but that's okay.

13:39.501 --> 13:41.949
I want to thank you for making
me confront my hoardiness,

13:41.960 --> 13:43.917
because it made me see
that I was just putting it

13:43.928 --> 13:46.170
as a barrier for the next
step in our relationship.

13:46.181 --> 13:47.913
That's the best thing
a therapist can hear.

13:47.915 --> 13:51.551
<i>Mi amor,</i> I decided
to move in with Johnny,

13:51.553 --> 13:53.052
in his house in New Jersey.

13:53.054 --> 13:54.920
- Yeah!
- A house!

13:54.922 --> 13:57.022
Oh, my goodness!

13:57.024 --> 13:59.625
No. No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

13:59.627 --> 14:02.328
Where the fuck is the
reverse-psychology section?!

14:02.330 --> 14:04.297
- Where is it?!
- Okay.

14:04.539 --> 14:06.463
Jaimé, I don't like to say "crazy,"

14:06.474 --> 14:09.070
but you are fuckin' nuts, okay?

14:09.081 --> 14:11.195
Moving to Jersey?! What are
you, Bruce Springsteen?!

14:11.206 --> 14:15.117
You're like... ♪ Henh,
henh, huhhhggh, eghghh ♪

14:15.119 --> 14:16.752
But I've... I've never done this.

14:16.754 --> 14:18.754
So you don't even know
Bruce Springsteen?

14:18.756 --> 14:20.622
Why would you move to Jersey?
Baby, listen.

14:20.624 --> 14:23.392
You were right... I need to
stop self-sabotaging myself.

14:23.394 --> 14:25.694
Now I need to take the next step
with my boyfriend.

14:25.696 --> 14:27.763
I see... One therapy session,
and now you're cured!

14:27.765 --> 14:30.199
- Okay, great.
- Not a real therapy session.

14:30.201 --> 14:32.168
Please! It wasn't. I'm sorry. It's not.

14:32.170 --> 14:34.237
Classic denial! You are mental, bro!

14:34.239 --> 14:36.639
Ilana, can I talk to you for a second?

14:36.650 --> 14:38.711
Let me just talk to you
for a second over here. Okay.

14:38.722 --> 14:40.442
If this is about
the fuckin' foot cheese,

14:40.444 --> 14:42.411
I swear to God, Abbi...
No, listen, dude.

14:42.413 --> 14:44.580
I think you need to take
some of your own advice.

14:44.582 --> 14:47.516
You just told Jaimé
that his hoarding problem

14:47.518 --> 14:50.519
was due to maybe
a lack of control, right?

14:50.521 --> 14:52.855
I feel like that's happening
with you right now.

14:52.857 --> 14:54.457
I mean, him moving out is a huge deal,

14:54.459 --> 14:56.359
and you're trying to control him.

14:56.361 --> 14:58.394
You have to let him live his own life.

14:58.396 --> 15:00.195
I said all that, huh?

15:00.197 --> 15:02.498
Yeah, you did.

15:02.500 --> 15:06.166
Hey, you guys. Fully sorry.
That was stupid.

15:06.177 --> 15:07.870
- It's okay.
- It's not about me.

15:07.872 --> 15:09.372
- I am so sorry.
- Mm. It's all good.

15:09.374 --> 15:11.240
You know, this is right for you guys.

15:11.242 --> 15:13.308
And you know what?
I think I've been scared

15:13.310 --> 15:16.011
because I have been feeling
like this was coming.

15:16.013 --> 15:17.344
Well, it's scary for me, too.

15:17.355 --> 15:19.448
I haven't lived without you
in such a long time.

15:19.450 --> 15:21.650
But you know what?
It's super easy. Just Montclair.

15:21.652 --> 15:23.819
It's, like, across the pond, you know?

15:23.821 --> 15:25.754
Wait. Where's Mon-claya?

15:25.756 --> 15:28.122
- It's "Montclair."
- Montclair!

15:28.124 --> 15:30.158
Um, so, who is this
Bruce Springsteen again?

15:30.160 --> 15:31.860
Yeah, I don't really know his music.

15:31.862 --> 15:33.995
- You don't know who The Boss is?
- Mnh-mnh.

15:33.997 --> 15:36.365
What does he sound like?

15:36.367 --> 15:39.267
Yeah.

15:39.269 --> 15:42.136
♪ Hey, mm, hey, he-hoo-ho ♪

15:42.138 --> 15:45.073
♪ Hey, mm, hey, hm, hey, hmm-hmm ♪

15:45.075 --> 15:47.376
♪ Hey, mm, baby! ♪

15:47.378 --> 15:49.444
- Right. I-I now get the vibe.
- You got it?

15:49.446 --> 15:50.846
- Ah, yes.
- I get the vibe.

16:00.857 --> 16:03.324
Hey, Johnny. Can I ask you something?

16:03.326 --> 16:07.228
- Yeah.
- Am I a good therapist?

16:07.230 --> 16:09.397
Well, I'll tell you this.

16:09.399 --> 16:12.299
No matter how wildly
unprofessional you were,

16:12.301 --> 16:15.269
you made the space for Jaimé
to talk about his issues.

16:15.271 --> 16:17.605
That's really all you can do
as a therapist, right?

16:17.607 --> 16:19.206
Just make the space.

16:19.208 --> 16:20.675
Yeah.

16:20.677 --> 16:22.109
- Thank you so much.
- Ah, yeah.

16:22.120 --> 16:24.066
Come here. Let me show you something.

16:24.077 --> 16:26.046
- Ilana, dude! That's it!
- What?

16:26.048 --> 16:29.316
"Make the space." I need to make
the space in Anthropologie.

16:29.318 --> 16:32.046
No one's gonna be like, "Hey, Abbi,
you want to do a window display?"

16:32.057 --> 16:34.588
- No, I got to fuckin' do it myself.
- Yes!

16:34.590 --> 16:38.559
Dude, and I can use all this
trash to, like, make the...

16:38.561 --> 16:40.862
What was that, Abbi?
What did you call it?

16:40.864 --> 16:42.429
Sorry, did I say... Did I say "trash"?

16:42.431 --> 16:44.465
I meant "precious objects."

16:44.467 --> 16:46.533
I can use all these beautiful,
precious objects...

16:46.535 --> 16:47.801
to make the display.

16:47.803 --> 16:48.903
That is it!

16:48.905 --> 16:50.137
- Yes!
- This is kismet.

16:50.139 --> 16:52.406
Follow your third eye... your clit.

16:52.408 --> 16:54.608
Right. Yeah. Thank you
for making me stay, dude.

16:54.610 --> 16:56.210
Really. It was worth it.

16:56.212 --> 16:58.346
Even if I had to eat your foot cheese.

16:58.348 --> 17:00.181
It always is.

17:39.554 --> 17:41.421
Christina, come on!

17:41.423 --> 17:44.358
You got to let me see my baby boy!

17:44.360 --> 17:48.595
Of course I'm responsible enough
to be a dad!

17:50.466 --> 17:52.560
Ohh. Christina!

17:52.571 --> 17:54.468
- Nasty.
- Don't hang up!

17:54.470 --> 17:57.136
Wha... No. You're not listening.

17:57.138 --> 18:00.039
You're not Li... Christina!
You're not listening!

18:06.147 --> 18:08.548
You're doing it!

18:08.550 --> 18:11.551
This is incredible!

18:11.553 --> 18:14.287
As per uszh... couldn't
have done it without ya.

18:25.331 --> 18:28.499
Ilana.

18:28.501 --> 18:30.066
We got to go, dude.

18:30.077 --> 18:33.445
- Okay.
- We got to go.

18:34.695 --> 18:36.696
- Good morning, bitch.
- Jesus!

18:36.707 --> 18:38.495
Ilana, what?

18:38.506 --> 18:40.645
Yeah, I guess I got carried away.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.167
- How do I look?
- Anthro-perfect.

18:44.178 --> 18:45.578
Okay, Ilana, the most important part

18:45.589 --> 18:47.748
- is that I made the space for my art.
- That's right.

18:47.759 --> 18:52.495
No matter what the outcome,
I feel completely at peace.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.606
You motherfuckers.

18:54.617 --> 18:57.652
This is insane. You know what?
Zoe, you're the fucking worst.

18:57.663 --> 19:00.263
I <i> dare</i> you to find someone who can fold

19:00.274 --> 19:02.174
a tunic sweater better than me!

19:02.185 --> 19:03.985
Ilana, let's go!

19:03.996 --> 19:06.296
Whatever, dude. They don't deserve you.

19:06.307 --> 19:09.842
Those corporate fashion fat cats
don't know real art.

19:09.872 --> 19:12.139
Yeah, that's true, but...
let's just get out of here.

19:12.141 --> 19:14.240
Uhp, hold up. Let's just
take a photo real quick

19:14.242 --> 19:15.609
in front of your masterpiece.

19:15.611 --> 19:16.943
For your portfolio!

19:16.945 --> 19:19.112
- Okay.
- Come on.

19:20.749 --> 19:23.817
Okay. Here we go.

19:23.819 --> 19:26.352
Oh, my God!

19:26.354 --> 19:28.054
- What?
- Rat Bastard!

19:28.056 --> 19:30.490
Oh, my God! Ilana, what?!

19:30.492 --> 19:35.128
Okay, I-I put a rodent and
hoarder trash in their window.

19:35.130 --> 19:37.998
I think they actually made
the right call.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.567
Damn. First Jaimé, and now Rat Bastard.

19:41.569 --> 19:44.704
Looks like all my roommates
are moving out.

19:44.706 --> 19:46.372
Yo, you know what? It's pretty badass

19:46.374 --> 19:48.608
to be banned from every
Anthropologie in the country.

19:48.610 --> 19:50.610
Like, not many people can say that.

19:50.612 --> 19:53.779
Yeah, I mean, that is true.
And you know what?

19:53.781 --> 19:55.581
Like, "make the space"

19:55.583 --> 19:58.017
is still, like, exactly
what I need right now.

19:58.019 --> 20:00.552
I just need to get a day job
that pays the bills,

20:00.554 --> 20:03.689
and then I can focus on my
artwork in my life, you know?

20:03.691 --> 20:05.124
Make the space.

20:05.126 --> 20:08.427
Dude, yes! I am, like,
so inspired by you.

20:08.429 --> 20:10.162
You know, I know I got carried away

20:10.164 --> 20:11.797
with this whole therapist thing,

20:11.799 --> 20:14.166
but helping Jaimé with his mental health

20:14.168 --> 20:17.870
really felt, like, right and good.

20:17.872 --> 20:20.172
I think I might want to, like, pursue it

20:20.174 --> 20:23.041
as a... career thing.

20:23.043 --> 20:25.644
Like, obviously in addition
to my Phone Wigs hustle.

20:25.646 --> 20:27.646
Dude, you would be incredible at that.

20:27.648 --> 20:28.981
Are you serious?

20:28.983 --> 20:32.118
Yes, and totally
and completely, and yes.

20:32.120 --> 20:33.785
Ooh, my mom is gonna flip out.

20:33.787 --> 20:35.671
Okay, I think I might, like,
start, like, "researching,"

20:35.682 --> 20:37.389
like, "schools" to apply to.

20:37.391 --> 20:39.558
- Is that crazy?
- No, not at all.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.460
But, listen, you
shouldn't use that word.

20:41.462 --> 20:44.763
My therapist says it
stigmatizes mental illness.

20:44.765 --> 20:47.500
Wait. You have a therapist?

20:47.502 --> 20:48.767
- You.
- Oh, my God.

20:48.769 --> 20:50.802
We might have to stop our sessions

20:50.804 --> 20:54.306
because I can't be in love
with my favorite patient.
