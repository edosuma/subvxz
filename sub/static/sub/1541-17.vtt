NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.921 --> 00:05.131
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

00:05.506 --> 00:07.174
Oh, my God. It's my mother.

00:07.341 --> 00:10.386
Only two prison worlds exist.
Mine, and the one created in 1903...

00:10.553 --> 00:13.389
...for locking up your mom
and her closet full of crazy pants.

00:13.556 --> 00:15.933
- Tell me how to get her back.
- Your mom's a ripper.

00:16.100 --> 00:17.685
ENZO:
Meet the real Sarah Salvatore.

00:17.852 --> 00:20.354
I'm going to make her do things
she never dreamed of...

00:20.521 --> 00:22.690
...until she begs me
to make her a vampire.

00:22.857 --> 00:24.358
- I'm pregnant.
ALARIC: Marry me.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.568
Yes.

00:25.735 --> 00:29.280
My mom is dead, and I
just need the pain to be gone.

00:29.447 --> 00:33.409
If anyone tries to flip my humanity switch
back on, I'll become your worst nightmare.

00:33.576 --> 00:34.744
- I like you.
- Stop.

00:34.952 --> 00:36.954
Come back.
What are you doing with Sarah?

00:37.121 --> 00:38.956
- I'm going to kill her.
- Aah!

00:39.123 --> 00:43.836
If Stefan wants to save Sarah's life,
all he has to do is shut his humanity off.

00:44.003 --> 00:47.798
ELENA: Stefan, don't you dare turn it off.
STEFAN: Just remember to bring me back.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.862
ENZO:
A hard-knock life, is it?

01:10.029 --> 01:11.739
CAROLINE:
Don't walk there.

01:11.906 --> 01:13.783
Ugh. I just washed that.

01:16.077 --> 01:18.496
My apologies, Cinderella.

01:19.663 --> 01:21.999
- What are you doing?
CAROLINE: Stefan and I had a moment.

01:22.166 --> 01:25.836
Things broke in the process. I'm returning
Scull Bar to the way we found it.

01:26.003 --> 01:30.007
The point of flipping your humanity switch
is you don't care how you leave things.

01:30.174 --> 01:31.634
I go to school here, Enzo.

01:31.801 --> 01:34.178
I want to keep going to school here.

01:34.345 --> 01:37.431
The second that I draw any suspicions...

01:37.598 --> 01:40.684
...break-ins, broken property,
dead bodies...

01:40.851 --> 01:42.937
...people will try to interrupt my routine.

01:43.104 --> 01:46.232
Then I will end up
rotting in a cell somewhere...

01:46.398 --> 01:50.653
...instead of what I should be doing, which
is preparing for my audition tomorrow.

01:50.986 --> 01:54.156
You, Caroline Forbes,
vampire without humanity...

01:54.323 --> 01:57.201
- ...auditioning for the school play.
- Musical.

01:57.409 --> 02:00.204
And obviously. Duh. I'm a drama major.

02:00.955 --> 02:02.498
What are you doing here?

02:03.040 --> 02:05.209
Find My Phone led me here.

02:05.376 --> 02:08.336
It didn't explain why your sticky fingers
needed it last night.

02:08.503 --> 02:10.840
You're the only one
with Sarah Salvatore's number.

02:11.423 --> 02:14.051
- Why would you need it?
- To use her life as leverage...

02:14.218 --> 02:16.887
...to convince Stefan
to shut his humanity switch off too.

02:17.054 --> 02:19.640
That's both clever and deeply unsettling.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.642
- Tell me she's still alive.
- She's alive.

02:22.560 --> 02:27.606
Assuming she survived any infections
resulting from Liam's amateur surgery.

02:27.773 --> 02:30.818
Which means Stefan's humanity
is a thing of the past.

02:30.985 --> 02:34.864
Like I said, I will stop at nothing
to maintain my routine.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.740
So I suggest that you stay away.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.951
Now if you don't mind...

02:39.577 --> 02:41.328
...I need to prepare for my audition.

02:53.883 --> 02:55.563
- How was the rave?
STEFAN: Oh, you know...

02:55.676 --> 02:58.929
...loud, lame, rave-like.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.681
Anything I should know?

03:00.848 --> 03:04.268
Anything you'd like to talk about,
bro to bro?

03:04.435 --> 03:05.811
Where do we keep our weapons?

03:06.353 --> 03:08.814
- Pardon?
- Crossbows, vervain grenades.

03:08.981 --> 03:10.900
All that hunter crap Jeremy was into.

03:11.609 --> 03:14.278
Ah, yes, the throne.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.919
Elena told on me. Shocker.

Not a good time
for a humanity flip, brother.

WOMAN: Whoa. Easy.

04:01.408 --> 04:02.493
Where am I?

04:02.660 --> 04:05.412
You're at Whitmore Medical Center.
I'm Dr. Laughlin.

04:08.165 --> 04:11.001
- Last night...
- You had a little bit too much to drink.

04:11.168 --> 04:14.213
A professor found you
passed out in the quad.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.007
I sort of remember that.

04:17.423 --> 04:20.928
It was like a spring break kickoff rave.

04:22.012 --> 04:25.391
- I should get home.
- Actually, I need you to sit tight.

04:25.557 --> 04:30.312
We need to look after you for a while.
You lost a lot of fluids last night. Okay?

04:36.360 --> 04:37.403
JO:
<i>For the record...</i>

04:37.945 --> 04:41.532
...I am not okay with turning my hospital
into a supernatural holding cell.

04:41.699 --> 04:44.868
Look, it's the first day of spring break,
the campus is a ghost town.

04:45.035 --> 04:48.706
We need to keep her out of harm's way
until Elena's blood is out of her system.

04:48.872 --> 04:52.793
Unless, of course, you wanna invite
another Salvatore vampire to our wedding.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.337
I'm starting to think that eloping
is the way to go.

04:55.504 --> 04:57.423
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

05:00.134 --> 05:04.305
She's been compelled to forget last night.
Soon she'll be back at Duke, safe...

05:04.471 --> 05:06.932
...with no idea what happened
and no one the wiser.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.185
Huh. Duke.

05:10.352 --> 05:11.812
That's not bad.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.315
It's a little obnoxious,
but kind of in a cute way.

05:14.481 --> 05:18.152
- You know? Little Duke.
- Wait.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.446
We're thinking baby names?

05:20.612 --> 05:21.947
- You haven't been?
- No.

05:22.114 --> 05:24.950
- I have. No, I have. I totally have.
- Name one.

Looking for a healthy outlet for my rage.

05:48.932 --> 05:49.975
Haven't found it yet.

05:50.142 --> 05:53.520
Stefan without his humanity is
one artery away from Stefan the Ripper.

05:53.687 --> 05:58.400
And every day that goes by is one year
of guilt waiting for him on the other side.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.694
Yeah, well...

06:00.903 --> 06:05.407
...not to add to our growing pile
of bad news...

06:05.574 --> 06:07.159
...but we didn't just lose Stefan.

06:07.326 --> 06:09.787
We lost our chance
to spark Caroline's humanity.

06:09.953 --> 06:12.081
Turns out he was her emotional trigger.

06:13.624 --> 06:15.793
- No, thanks.
- Take it away from me...

06:15.959 --> 06:18.504
...because I'm seconds away
from using it on this.

06:20.464 --> 06:21.673
Yeah.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.094
Who is that?

06:25.260 --> 06:28.764
This is Lillian Salvatore.

06:30.391 --> 06:32.434
- Your mother is alive?
- Yup.

06:32.601 --> 06:37.689
Turns out she's been in a prison-world
snapshot of 1903 for over a century.

06:37.856 --> 06:40.234
- Your mother is alive.
- Oh, yeah, alive and well.

06:40.401 --> 06:43.195
Not in the pine box
that I thought I buried her in, in 1858.

06:43.362 --> 06:46.240
And apparently, she's a vampire.
Not just any kind of vampire...

06:46.407 --> 06:49.827
Damon, your mother is alive.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.412
She's a ripper, Elena.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.915
Makes perfect sense.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.875
Stefan was always such a mama's boy.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.630
How much of a mama's boy?

07:01.797 --> 07:05.467
He would've hanged himself with Mother's
apron strings if it meant her approval.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.928
We both would. We loved her.

07:08.971 --> 07:10.222
She was our world.

07:11.932 --> 07:12.975
What?

07:14.977 --> 07:17.312
No. No way.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.231
This is our way to get Stefan back.

07:19.398 --> 07:22.234
You can't tell me that his mother
isn't an emotional trigger.

07:22.401 --> 07:23.819
She killed so many people...

07:23.986 --> 07:27.030
...that an entire coven of witches
built her a permanent time-out.

07:27.197 --> 07:29.867
Don't fix one ripper problem
by unleashing another ripper.

07:30.033 --> 07:33.537
Think about it. If this works,
we don't just get Stefan and Caroline back.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.914
We get your mother back.

07:36.623 --> 07:41.003
Aren't you even
a little curious to see her?

07:42.754 --> 07:45.841
- I might know a few witches that can help.

07:47.551 --> 07:48.635
Ow.

I hate Kai. You know that.
First thing you did when I got back...

07:52.014 --> 07:54.141
...was throw him in my face
to fake-apologize.

07:54.308 --> 07:56.602
Yeah, and then I real-apologized
for being a dick.

07:56.768 --> 07:58.979
And here you are,
less than 24 hours later...

07:59.146 --> 08:03.233
- ...asking me to work with him.
- Bonnie, we need Kai to get to 1903.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.028
And we need Bennett blood
to do the damn spell.

08:06.195 --> 08:08.197
Listen, we go in, we grab my mom...

08:08.363 --> 08:11.950
...she flips Stefan's switch,
he triggers Caroline, emotional dominoes.

Hey, everybody wins.

08:15.537 --> 08:19.041
If I give you my blood,
will you just get out of my face?

08:19.208 --> 08:20.292
Probably.

in my pocket and pull it out.

up for the hell that you put me through...

08:41.145 --> 08:42.188
...this is it.

08:42.940 --> 08:46.026
Okay, the problem is,
the Gemini kept the existence...

08:46.193 --> 08:48.612
...of the 1903 prison world
a secret for generations.

08:48.779 --> 08:52.741
To find the key to that particular jail
cell, I'd have to navigate ancient texts...

08:52.908 --> 08:56.078
...undo layers
of magical cloaking spells and...

08:58.455 --> 08:59.998
