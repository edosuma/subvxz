- Thank you.

35:16.014 --> 35:17.314
- Wanna get
any appetizers going?

35:17.349 --> 35:19.332
- The heirloom tomato salad.

35:19.368 --> 35:20.367
- Oh, let's do the charcuterie.

35:20.402 --> 35:21.351
- Charcuterie?
- Yeah.

35:21.403 --> 35:22.569
- Sure, absolutely.

35:24.273 --> 35:25.638
- We have to talk
about our stuff,

35:25.657 --> 35:27.107
and I get that,
but for me today

35:27.142 --> 35:29.276
that was like
so much perspective and--

35:29.311 --> 35:30.610
- oh, absolutely.

35:30.645 --> 35:32.696
- I think we should try
to get her to come.

35:32.748 --> 35:34.531
- She wants--she said
that she wanted to go out.

35:34.583 --> 35:37.751
- She does?
I think you should call her.

35:37.786 --> 35:41.087
- Shall I do facetime?
- Oh, yeah.

35:42.124 --> 35:44.341
- Well, this light
isn't very good.

35:45.160 --> 35:46.960
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:46.995 --> 35:48.428
I don't know if you made
other plans,

35:48.463 --> 35:50.697
but why don't you come
and meet gina and I

35:50.732 --> 35:52.232
for a well--

35:52.267 --> 35:54.100
- for a well-needed cocktail.

35:56.504 --> 35:59.139
- We just wanna see you--we
don't care what you look like.

35:59.174 --> 36:00.807
We'll see you soon, okay?

36:02.911 --> 36:04.110
- Bye.
Bye.

36:05.180 --> 36:10.066
- Noella put our situation
in more perspective

36:10.118 --> 36:12.118
for me personally,

36:12.154 --> 36:14.571
but...

36:14.623 --> 36:18.241
Clearly, I'm not happy
about how everything happened.

36:18.293 --> 36:20.794
I don't want to be
fighting with you.

36:20.829 --> 36:22.829
- When I told you guys
that it just--that--

36:22.864 --> 36:26.049
and I'm sorry, it still
doesn't make sense to me

36:26.084 --> 36:27.584
that someone would be friends

36:27.636 --> 36:29.369
with someone they were involved
in a lawsuit with.

36:29.388 --> 36:31.171
- It doesn't make sense
to me either, but--

36:31.206 --> 36:34.841
- no, no, but that being said,
I felt that you and I and emily

36:34.876 --> 36:37.093
were having a moment
and, you know,

36:37.145 --> 36:39.179
I wanted to believe
the friendship

36:39.214 --> 36:42.548
and we have each other's backs
and we've come so far--

36:42.568 --> 36:44.234
- yeah, I'm sure--
- shannon, the bottom line is

36:44.269 --> 36:45.919
I didn't do anything
to hurt anybody.

36:45.954 --> 36:49.239
- But you did.
- I didn't do it to hurt you.

36:49.274 --> 36:50.657
I didn't do it hurt heather.

36:50.692 --> 36:52.275
You should have
told your friend.

36:52.327 --> 36:54.494
Listen, you want to know
why I told her that day?

36:54.529 --> 36:56.580
You wanna know?
- You said to protect her,

36:56.615 --> 36:57.914
and I wanna know what
you were protecting her from.

36:57.950 --> 36:59.866
- Do you wanna know?
The day that I found out

36:59.902 --> 37:01.451
my husband
was having an affair,

37:01.503 --> 37:03.620
he brought me
to the woman's home

37:03.672 --> 37:06.506
and everybody at that
in ----ing barbecue

37:06.541 --> 37:08.758
knew what was going on
except for me.

37:11.280 --> 37:12.629
- My husband had
an affair too,

37:12.681 --> 37:14.414
and I was humiliated
in front of everybody.

37:14.433 --> 37:15.632
- Yeah, but you know what,
shannon, we're here now

37:15.684 --> 37:17.601
and I'm telling you something

37:17.636 --> 37:19.619
and you still just want to be
focused about how you're right.

37:19.655 --> 37:22.755
I don't care if you're right.

37:22.774 --> 37:24.774
- Sorry, ladies, I'm just gonna
drop this off for you.

37:24.810 --> 37:25.759
- Wow, gina, you know,

37:25.794 --> 37:27.777
I've gone out of my way
to be kind to you.

37:27.813 --> 37:29.396
- You shouldn't have to go
out of your way

37:29.431 --> 37:30.947
to be kind to people.
I don't go out of my way

37:30.983 --> 37:33.366
to be kind to people--
I'm just kind to people.

37:33.402 --> 37:34.868
- Really?
- If it's that much of a burden

37:34.903 --> 37:37.904
to you, then you need
to reevaluate that.

37:37.940 --> 37:39.572
That's a problem.

37:39.607 --> 37:41.607
<i> - There's a lot of cruelty</i>
<i> at this table tonight.</i>

37:41.627 --> 37:44.494
I bent over backwards
in my past to help gina out,

37:44.546 --> 37:46.313
so I have been there for her.

37:46.348 --> 37:48.465
- And by the way, you went
around to heather

37:48.500 --> 37:49.782
and you told heather me
and emily can't be trusted.

37:49.801 --> 37:51.451
- You can't be trusted.
- So why are you

37:51.470 --> 37:52.836
giving us information
if you don't trust us?

37:52.888 --> 37:55.121
Wait, so why would you give us,
'cause people you don't trust--

37:55.140 --> 37:56.990
- I wanted to believe you were
my good friends that night.

37:57.025 --> 37:58.508
- People you don't trust,
but you don't, because

37:58.560 --> 38:00.994
you're also talking sh--
about us behind our backs.

38:18.780 --> 38:20.130

38:21.800 --> 38:23.049
Right, so why

38:23.085 --> 38:24.784

38:28.307 --> 38:30.890
you're also talking sh--

38:30.926 --> 38:33.677
- I made a mistake and I'm
an ass---- for doing it.

38:33.729 --> 38:37.314
- Here we are,
and I can only work

38:37.349 --> 38:38.815
with what we have now,

38:38.850 --> 38:43.069
and at the end of the day,
I really do care about you.

38:43.105 --> 38:44.938
- I mean, especially
after new york,

38:44.973 --> 38:46.106
I thought
we really bonded there.

38:46.141 --> 38:48.325
- I know, I was like I had like
a genuinely nice time

38:48.360 --> 38:49.475
with you in new york.

38:49.494 --> 38:52.812
Recently, we just like
traveled together to new york

38:52.848 --> 38:56.482
and I got to know her
I think on a deeper level,

38:56.501 --> 39:00.420
and I feel like shannon
is pulling me back to a place

39:00.455 --> 39:02.372
where
I don't wanna go with her.

39:02.424 --> 39:04.507
Look, I don't like this,
and I'm sorry

39:04.543 --> 39:06.676
that this didn't go,
you know--

39:06.712 --> 39:09.179
- I'm in such a positive place
and happy place,

39:09.214 --> 39:10.680
like the last thing
in the world I want to do

39:10.716 --> 39:12.832
is be--is fight,
be involved in drama,

39:12.851 --> 39:14.500
and have anything negative.

39:14.519 --> 39:15.885
- This is going
in the right direction.

39:15.937 --> 39:18.355
I think we both
just had to get it out.

39:18.390 --> 39:21.141
I really just wanna like
put this to bed and move on.

39:21.176 --> 39:22.559
- I don't want to hurt anyone.
- It's the worst.

39:22.611 --> 39:24.060
- I don't want to hurt anyone.
- It's the worst.

39:24.112 --> 39:26.146
But, yeah,
I'll keep one eye open.

39:26.181 --> 39:30.066
I mean, I wish I had three
so I could keep two open.

39:30.118 --> 39:31.851
And some in the back
of my head.

39:31.870 --> 39:35.121
I think that this got way off
the rails and out of control.

39:35.157 --> 39:37.123
- Okay, I get
what you're saying.

39:37.159 --> 39:39.159
Lesson learned.
Lesson learned.

39:42.581 --> 39:44.497
<i> - I honestly, like,</i>
<i> when I get into that space,</i>

39:44.532 --> 39:46.032
<i> I like black out a bit.</i>

39:46.051 --> 39:48.168
So I don't actually--I don't
know like the things I said,

39:48.203 --> 39:50.470
but I do apologize for anything
rude that I said to you.

39:50.505 --> 39:51.838
- Hey, boo, hey.
- Hi.

39:51.873 --> 39:53.873
- Hey, girl, hey.
- Hey, boo, hey.

39:53.892 --> 39:56.209
- How are you?
- Oh my god, hey, girl, hey.

39:56.228 --> 39:57.677
- I'm ----ing fabulous.

39:57.712 --> 39:59.712
- Well, you look so good.

39:59.748 --> 40:02.548
Look so pretty.
You're so skinny.

40:02.567 --> 40:05.251
Look at you.
- That's a stress diet.

40:05.287 --> 40:06.736
- That's a stress diet.

40:06.772 --> 40:08.221
- Stress looks so good on you.

40:08.240 --> 40:10.240
- Thank you.
It's a body that stress built.

40:10.275 --> 40:13.159
- That is a very good look
on you, girlfriend.

40:13.195 --> 40:16.613
- Ooh, that extra dirty
martini's calling to me.

40:16.665 --> 40:18.164
- We gotta get you one.

40:18.200 --> 40:21.067
- Is there an iv bag option?
Can we just mainline this?

40:21.086 --> 40:23.169
- We have our to-go bags;
they're very similar.

40:23.205 --> 40:24.788
I'll be right back.
Let me go grab that for ya.

40:24.840 --> 40:27.707
- I'm happy to see you two.
- Have you heard anything?

40:30.095 --> 40:32.712
- The shutting off
the ----ing credit cards...

40:32.747 --> 40:36.015
- Yeah, that's not okay.
- That's a big no-no.

40:36.051 --> 40:38.935
Like, that's just like--
with our son...

40:38.970 --> 40:42.472
- That's ----ed.
That is ----ed.

40:42.524 --> 40:45.024
- I don't have a bank account
with savings in it.

40:45.060 --> 40:48.394
I don't have access
to any other line of credit.

40:48.430 --> 40:51.231
- Extra dirty.
- Yay, vodka!

40:51.266 --> 40:55.268
My husband's in control of
all of our family's finances.

40:55.287 --> 40:57.570
Why is this happening?

40:57.605 --> 40:59.289
I have more questions
than answers.

40:59.324 --> 41:01.908
And that is not
a safe place for me to be.

41:01.943 --> 41:03.843
- Gina and I are here for you.
- We are.

41:03.879 --> 41:06.312
- This is a lot more helpful
than you girls know.

41:06.348 --> 41:08.114
It really is.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.717
- You know, we've both
been like blindsided.

41:10.752 --> 41:12.135
I mean, he walked out on me,

41:12.170 --> 41:14.220
but yours is
a whole nother step up.

41:14.256 --> 41:16.890
- My lawyer was saying
it takes sometimes 30 days

41:16.925 --> 41:19.309
to do ex parte.
And it really was--

41:19.344 --> 41:21.511
- people dispute their taxes
all the time.

41:21.563 --> 41:24.314
- What we fought about was
I was forcing the sale

41:24.349 --> 41:25.482
of the house in puerto rico.

41:25.517 --> 41:27.300
- Right.
- We got an amazing offer.

41:27.335 --> 41:28.801
- The amazing offer, yeah.

41:28.837 --> 41:31.304
- And I was saying
"I'm going to sell the house."

41:31.323 --> 41:32.772
then with the liens lifted,

41:32.807 --> 41:34.324
the debts are paid,
and then we're done.

41:34.359 --> 41:36.025
Isn't that great?
I'm like,

41:36.077 --> 41:39.712
why do we have this emotional
attachment to this house?

41:40.999 --> 41:43.316
- No, he's from utah.

41:43.351 --> 41:45.084
He's an ex-mormon from utah.

41:45.120 --> 41:47.486
We've owned it
for seven months.

41:47.506 --> 41:48.755
Who cares?
- Right.

41:48.790 --> 41:50.340
- Why is it that big of a deal?

41:50.375 --> 41:52.792
- Yeah, that's really random.

41:54.963 --> 41:57.130
It does suck for you, though.

41:57.165 --> 41:59.332
- It's a weird time in my life.

41:59.351 --> 42:01.100
To divorce!

42:02.854 --> 42:05.939
<i> - Next time on...</i>

42:05.974 --> 42:07.140
- What a beautiful home.

42:07.175 --> 42:09.025
Oh, look at him
with the shirt off.

42:09.060 --> 42:10.710
- Ryne never wears a shirt.

42:10.745 --> 42:12.245
- Yeah, but you know,
he looks good.

42:15.016 --> 42:16.349
- Why are you angry?

42:16.384 --> 42:17.951
- There's nothing I can do
to control

42:17.986 --> 42:19.586
any of your problems.

42:19.621 --> 42:21.371
- Noella spoke condescending
to me at the party.

42:21.406 --> 42:23.706
- Oh, she did?
- I don't like mean girls.

42:23.742 --> 42:24.824
Noella, she said...

42:26.194 --> 42:27.627
- Oh.

42:27.662 --> 42:29.746
- [crying, mumbling]

42:29.798 --> 42:32.799
my life is falling apart.

42:32.834 --> 42:35.001
- C'mon, get up.

42:36.171 --> 42:39.005
- You passed the bar.
I want to throw a party.

42:40.041 --> 42:42.708
- The only adjectives you used
to describe me to heather

42:42.727 --> 42:45.178
was untrustworthy
and manipulative.

42:45.213 --> 42:47.063
I thought we were friends,
shannon.

42:47.098 --> 42:48.898
- I didn't say those words.
I didn't say those words.

42:48.934 --> 42:50.767
- So you're saying
heather's a liar?

42:50.819 --> 42:53.553
- We're not gonna--do you
wanna do that right now?

42:53.588 --> 42:56.055
- If you ever come
after my family,

42:56.074 --> 43:00.276
you're going to lose a lot more
than just my friendship.
