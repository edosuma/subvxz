00:14.492 --> 00:17.365
♪ I think
I'm fallin' for you... ♪

00:19.454 --> 00:22.718
And ever since then, I've had to
keep my cats in separate rooms.

00:24.720 --> 00:27.636
Well, you see, that would
never happen with dogs.

00:27.679 --> 00:29.464
Which brings us to my
original argument--

00:29.507 --> 00:31.031
all dogs are boys,

00:31.074 --> 00:33.076
and all cats are girls.

00:33.120 --> 00:36.471
I don't think this debate
is gonna end anytime soon,

00:36.514 --> 00:38.299
and, um,

00:38.342 --> 00:42.738
I think that this bar closes
in, like, ten minutes.

00:42.781 --> 00:45.175
What are you suggesting?

00:49.092 --> 00:50.920
Just because

00:50.963 --> 00:52.835
the bar is closed
doesn't mean we have

00:52.878 --> 00:54.097
to stop drinking.

00:54.141 --> 00:56.186
Great point.

01:17.164 --> 01:18.643
The target has been secured.

01:18.687 --> 01:19.731
Prints?

01:24.345 --> 01:28.088
Very well. Secure Mr. Grimshaw's
mobile, stay with him.

01:28.131 --> 01:30.220
Someone from our team will
grab him within the hour.

01:30.264 --> 01:32.222
Does this assignment
settle our arrangement?

01:32.266 --> 01:34.529
I'm afraid the assignment's
barely just begun.

01:34.572 --> 01:35.878
What's next?

01:35.921 --> 01:38.228
We'll be in touch.

01:52.373 --> 01:55.027
I'm famished.

01:55.071 --> 01:56.725
I'm gonna take that
as a compliment.

01:58.379 --> 02:00.598
Go ahead and help yourself out
to anything in the fridge.

02:00.642 --> 02:04.602
I get to pick between week-old
leftovers from Pig & the Lady

02:04.646 --> 02:06.300
and an open box
of baking soda?

02:06.343 --> 02:07.823
Hmm, is that what you think?

02:08.650 --> 02:11.609
Just check it out.

02:25.493 --> 02:28.148
No... way.

02:30.628 --> 02:32.326
Oh, hey.

02:32.369 --> 02:34.719
Uh, I was just texting you.

02:36.243 --> 02:37.200
Oh.

02:37.244 --> 02:40.203
You're not...

02:41.248 --> 02:43.946
Well, I wasn't texting you,
obviously. Hi. Hello.

02:43.989 --> 02:47.079
Hi. Hi. Uh, I figured
you didn't mean me.

02:47.123 --> 02:49.952
- You don't have my number.
Impressed with the groceries?

02:49.995 --> 02:53.651
I went a little ham,
no pun intended.

02:55.262 --> 02:57.307
Higgins.

02:57.351 --> 03:00.615
I tried calling you and texting
you, but you weren't picking up,

03:00.658 --> 03:03.139
so... here I am.

03:03.183 --> 03:06.490
Yeah. Uh, I was busy.

03:06.534 --> 03:08.623
You're busy?

03:08.666 --> 03:09.624
Yeah.

03:10.712 --> 03:12.061
Paperwork.

03:12.104 --> 03:14.063
Why were you calling?

03:14.106 --> 03:16.326
We have a case. The client wants
to meet really soon.

03:16.370 --> 03:18.372
I did try texting you about it.

03:18.415 --> 03:21.375
Okay, well,
I will, uh, get dressed

03:21.418 --> 03:22.724
and, uh, see you in a minute.

03:22.767 --> 03:24.639
Very well.

03:24.682 --> 03:27.468
I will see you in the car.

03:27.511 --> 03:29.121
Mm-hmm.

03:29.165 --> 03:31.254
Do you have time for breakfast?

03:31.298 --> 03:33.256
Now, when you say "breakfast,"

03:33.300 --> 03:35.737
do you mean breakfast,
or breakfast?

03:35.780 --> 03:37.478
Guys,

03:37.521 --> 03:39.741
I'm leaving,
but I'm still here. Just...

03:39.784 --> 03:43.223
But I'm...
I'm going.

03:49.316 --> 03:51.013
So, did you end up
having breakfast?

03:51.056 --> 03:52.362
We talking about
food or sex?

03:52.406 --> 03:54.582
Food! Magnum,
I'm talking about food.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.627
Well, you're the one
who barged in unannounced.

03:56.671 --> 03:58.586
Barged in?
I called and texted first.

03:58.629 --> 04:00.588
Yeah, but you
didn't knock.

04:00.631 --> 04:02.242
Who doesn't knock when
they enter a house?

04:02.285 --> 04:03.808
Well, you never knock when
you come into the main house.

04:03.852 --> 04:06.811
And why is she sneaking over
anyway? I know about her.

04:06.855 --> 04:08.378
You knew about her,
but she didn't know

04:08.422 --> 04:09.901
that you knew about
her until today.

04:09.945 --> 04:11.251
Right.

04:11.294 --> 04:12.861
She's a very private person,
okay?

04:12.904 --> 04:14.863
I mean, I know that.

04:14.906 --> 04:17.213
I think I pretty much
have her figured out.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.041
Oh, really?

04:19.084 --> 04:20.303
Okay, let's hear it.

04:20.347 --> 04:21.957
All right.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.741
She's 30.

04:23.785 --> 04:25.656
She's street smart
but not book smart.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.658
She comes
from a long line of cops.

04:27.702 --> 04:30.139
And you obviously
met her on a case.

04:30.182 --> 04:32.272
Wow. That's actually
pretty impressive

04:32.315 --> 04:34.186
how completely wrong you are.

04:34.230 --> 04:36.188
First of all, she's 35.

04:36.232 --> 04:37.973
Uh, graduated top of her class

04:38.016 --> 04:40.758
in college and the Academy.
Her mother was a waitress.

04:40.802 --> 04:42.630
Her father left
before she was born.

04:42.673 --> 04:45.328
And we actually met
at a shooting range.

04:45.372 --> 04:47.896
It was really kind of sexy.

04:47.939 --> 04:51.900
Bullets were whizzing by,
and that long hair, you know.

04:51.943 --> 04:53.597
So, you really have no idea
what you're talking about.

04:53.641 --> 04:55.686
Of course I don't.
That was just the best way

04:55.730 --> 04:58.080
to get you to tell me
about your secret girlfriend.

04:58.123 --> 05:00.430
Ah, okay. Clever.

05:17.012 --> 05:19.449
Did you...?Obviously not. Did you?

05:19.493 --> 05:21.146
No.

05:46.215 --> 05:50.132
Ah. Jin. Wow,
looking sharper than usual.

05:50.175 --> 05:52.308
Oh, that's very offensive,
but thanks. That means a lot.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.831
I am spending the day

05:53.875 --> 05:55.833
with my niece,
and I wanted to look nice.

05:55.877 --> 05:57.487
And by the way,
she has no idea

05:57.531 --> 06:00.316
that I was ever a criminal,
so no one say a word.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.013
And just go along with it

06:02.057 --> 06:04.276
if she's under the impression
that I own the place.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.756
And why would she have
that impression?

06:05.800 --> 06:08.063
Okay,
Hello, gents.

06:08.106 --> 06:09.586
TC, how are
you feeling?

06:09.630 --> 06:12.850
Oh, the skyjackers
were kind enough

06:12.894 --> 06:15.418
to avoid any organs
when they shot me, so...

06:15.462 --> 06:17.681
I'm healing up just fine.

06:17.725 --> 06:19.074
Really, Magnum?
Not gonna say anything?

06:19.117 --> 06:20.771
Uh, yeah.

06:20.815 --> 06:23.165
Why'd you put me and Higgins
on a mobile billboard?

06:23.208 --> 06:25.036
That's driving
around already? Nice.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.038
I mean... surprise.

06:27.082 --> 06:29.127
Hey, what are you talking about?

06:29.171 --> 06:30.477
Yeah. How'd you know it was me?

06:30.520 --> 06:32.130
Well, we called
the leasing company.

06:32.174 --> 06:33.523
Why on earth would you do
something like this?

06:33.567 --> 06:35.264
After I shut down
my cash-cleaning business,

06:35.307 --> 06:37.658
I had six months left
on the lease for my billboard.

06:37.701 --> 06:40.530
I was gonna blow it up, you
know, get out of the contract,

06:40.574 --> 06:42.227
but I realized
that wasn't gonna work out.

06:42.271 --> 06:44.055
Okay, wait.
So, just to be clear--

06:44.099 --> 06:47.624
blowing up your own billboard
is not helpful. Got it.

06:47.668 --> 06:49.234
Okay, also, I figured out

06:49.278 --> 06:51.149
that I'd give you guys
free advertisement.

06:51.193 --> 06:52.542
You get new clients rolling in,

06:52.586 --> 06:54.805
and you're gonna throw
old Jin some cheddar.

06:54.849 --> 06:57.025
Jin, I know you mean well,

06:57.068 --> 06:58.809
but you got
to take the billboard down.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.985
We actually do really well
just by word of mouth.

07:01.029 --> 07:03.031
Yeah. Plus, you two work
under the radar, so

07:03.074 --> 07:05.250
having your faces
on a billboard is the last thing

07:05.294 --> 07:06.687
you would want.

07:06.730 --> 07:08.819
Geez. All right,
I'll take care of it. Man,

07:08.863 --> 07:11.387
I got to shake off these bad
vibes before my niece gets here.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.694
And by the way, she has no idea
I was ever in prison.

07:13.737 --> 07:16.218
Oh, and, Higgins,
if she's under the impression

07:16.261 --> 07:17.524
that you and I used to date,

07:17.567 --> 07:19.134
and also
that you're still heartbroken,

07:19.177 --> 07:20.396
and also you have a pet name--

07:20.440 --> 07:22.267
Juju Higgy-bear--
just go with it.

07:22.311 --> 07:24.618
Uh, you know what? I don't
have time for this.

07:24.661 --> 07:26.489
- Our client's here.
- You never do.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.360
That's why it didn't work out
between us, Juju.

07:28.404 --> 07:31.363
I'm a caddie
at Ko 'Opua Country Club.

07:31.407 --> 07:34.062
Or, well, I was.

07:34.105 --> 07:36.107
Two sets of golf clubs
went missing recently,

07:36.151 --> 07:40.024
and they're saying I stole 'em,
so I was suspended without pay.

07:40.068 --> 07:41.722
Unless I can prove
I didn't do it,

07:41.765 --> 07:44.464
my entire future is in jeopardy.

07:44.507 --> 07:46.814
- Your entire future?
- I know.

07:46.857 --> 07:50.513
Sounds dramatic, but I play
on the amateur circuit,

07:50.557 --> 07:53.298
and they say
I have a real shot at going pro.

07:53.342 --> 07:55.039
Losing this job means

07:55.083 --> 07:57.389
losing everything
I've been working towards.

07:57.433 --> 07:59.566
So, I understand
what you're saying, but

07:59.609 --> 08:01.524
why did they think
- you stole the clubs?
- They said

08:01.568 --> 08:04.048
a witness saw me taking them out
of the storage locker,

08:04.092 --> 08:08.052
but whoever that is, they're
either lying or mistaken 'cause

08:08.096 --> 08:09.837
I didn't do it.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.709
But they believed 'em enough
to report it to HPD.

08:12.753 --> 08:14.494
So, on top of everything,

08:14.537 --> 08:16.931
you're looking
at a possible felony conviction.

08:17.932 --> 08:19.847
Yeah.

08:22.589 --> 08:26.549
When I was six, my parents saw
I had a passion for golf

08:26.593 --> 08:29.073
and sacrificed everything
for me.

08:29.117 --> 08:32.468
Even took on second jobs
so I could join league play.

08:32.512 --> 08:37.952
I-I'd never jeopardize my future
and all that they sacrificed.

08:39.301 --> 08:40.389
You got to believe me.

08:42.043 --> 08:44.828
Great. Okay. Thanks, Tatty.

08:44.872 --> 08:46.047
Your fridge.

08:47.265 --> 08:48.484
There's food in it.

08:49.441 --> 08:50.617
- It's a fridge.
- But...

08:50.660 --> 08:52.053
there's never food.

08:52.096 --> 08:53.794
I finally
demanded that if we were

08:53.837 --> 08:55.535
gonna keep meeting here,

08:55.578 --> 08:58.538
that, uh, Thomas stock his
refrigerator, like an adult.

08:58.581 --> 09:00.191
Ooh, nice call.

09:00.235 --> 09:02.237
- We all win.
- Mm-hmm.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.282
Did Tatty ever send
- that police report?
- Yes, the two sets

09:04.326 --> 09:06.241
of stolen clubs
were worth $5,000.

09:06.284 --> 09:08.635
The witness who supposedly
saw Trevor steal them

09:08.678 --> 09:11.289
is a member named Stan Peters.

09:11.333 --> 09:12.639
Well, Ko 'Opua must
have security cameras.

09:12.682 --> 09:14.205
Maybe they caught something.

09:14.249 --> 09:15.511
They do, but they only cover
the main areas,

09:15.555 --> 09:16.991
and not the storage locker

09:17.034 --> 09:19.036
where the clubs were
actually stolen from.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.560
Still think
we should get the footage.

09:20.603 --> 09:22.083
I mean,
if we can put Trevor elsewhere

09:22.126 --> 09:23.519
at the time of the theft,
that'll exonerate him.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.347
It's a good idea.
And at some point,

09:25.390 --> 09:27.175
we ought to check if anyone
tried to sell the stolen clubs

09:27.218 --> 09:29.786
- to any local pawnshops.
- I can do that for you.

09:29.830 --> 09:32.006
Well, that would be a huge help.
Thank you.

09:32.049 --> 09:34.182
Uh, so what's the plan here?

09:34.225 --> 09:36.837
Because Ko 'Opua is
notoriously uptight.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.621
I can't imagine
they'd cooperate

09:38.665 --> 09:40.144
with any investigation if it'd

09:40.188 --> 09:42.582
create any sense of alarm.

09:42.625 --> 09:44.671
Yeah, they're not gonna want
to cooperate with investigators

09:44.714 --> 09:46.629
hired by the kid
that they just suspended.

09:46.673 --> 09:49.197
Which is why
we are going undercover.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.502
And what's your in?

09:50.546 --> 09:51.852
Rick's buddy runs

09:51.895 --> 09:52.983
the food and beverage side
of things,

09:53.027 --> 09:54.071
and he's agreed to hire us

09:54.115 --> 09:55.856
as fill-in
bartenders.

09:55.899 --> 09:58.119
And I will be going in
as a member.

09:58.162 --> 10:00.861
Well, the wait list
at Ko 'Opua is six months,

10:00.904 --> 10:02.863
uh, if not longer.

10:02.906 --> 10:05.909
Yes, but clubs like Ko 'Opua
have reciprocal member programs

10:05.953 --> 10:08.042
with other country clubs,
so I'm going

10:08.085 --> 10:10.914
to assume the identity of
a mainland guest who has access.

10:10.958 --> 10:12.437
It's kind of
a small program,

10:12.481 --> 10:13.917
so there aren't that many
members to choose from,

10:13.961 --> 10:16.877
but after narrowing it down
to age, race, and sex,

10:16.920 --> 10:21.098
looks like there is
one viable member.

10:23.753 --> 10:26.277
Hmm. You think
you can pull it off?

10:26.321 --> 10:27.322
Quite sure.

10:27.365 --> 10:29.063
Oh, this'll be fun.

15:18.178 --> 15:19.962
Well, why didn't you say so?

15:21.964 --> 15:23.792

15:29.885 --> 15:31.887

15:35.760 --> 15:38.111

15:39.764 --> 15:41.723

Yeah, yeah. Plenty
of golf to play.

17:42.191 --> 17:43.540
And that's what
I'm worried about.

17:43.584 --> 17:45.847
Yeah. So, uh,

17:45.890 --> 17:49.111
you, uh, thinking about

17:49.155 --> 17:51.244

of clubs stolen recently.

17:55.987 --> 17:58.033
Well, that was just
an isolated thing.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.948
And they caught the kid
that stole 'em, thanks to Stan.

17:59.991 --> 18:01.515
You caught the thief, Stan?

18:01.558 --> 18:04.126
Yeah. Yeah, well, uh, no.

18:04.170 --> 18:06.041
I just witnessed him taking 'em.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.999
He's just being humble. If it
weren't for Stan, they wouldn't

18:08.043 --> 18:09.305
have been reported stolen yet.

18:09.349 --> 18:10.567
The owners aren't even on Oahu.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.308
- What do you mean?
- They shipped them in

18:12.352 --> 18:13.527
- ahead of time through Club2
- Club.

18:13.570 --> 18:16.486
- And what is Club2
- Club?

18:25.408 --> 18:26.801
Hey, you want a
hot dog, Harper?

18:26.844 --> 18:28.498
Uh, no, thanks.

18:28.542 --> 18:31.284
I'm gonna go and flirt with
that cutie behind the bar there,

18:31.327 --> 18:34.417
and I ain't leaving till I get
his number, so take your time.

18:37.290 --> 18:38.508
Hi.
Hey.

18:38.552 --> 18:40.119
Did I hear you call me a cutie?

18:40.162 --> 18:42.512
Well, Harper clearly has
questionable taste.

18:42.556 --> 18:46.168
Okay, so I was able to, uh,
get the security footage.

18:46.212 --> 18:49.258
I couldn't place Trevor
at the time of the theft,

18:49.302 --> 18:50.955
but I did find
something interesting.

18:50.999 --> 18:53.175
Hmm.

18:53.219 --> 18:55.612
That is a very nice watch
for a caddie.

18:55.656 --> 18:57.266
That's what I was thinking.
Guy's name is Benji,

18:57.310 --> 18:58.963
and I got to get a closer look
at the watch to see

18:59.007 --> 19:00.443
if it's actually a real Rolex.

19:00.487 --> 19:02.706
If it is, this guy could
be worth looking into.

19:02.750 --> 19:05.100
Agreed. Well, I have
something, as well.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.536
So the stolen bags
were recently

19:06.580 --> 19:08.582
shipped here
- using Club2
- Club.

19:08.625 --> 19:10.671
It's a service
that transports golf bags

19:10.714 --> 19:12.020
between country clubs
around the world.

19:12.063 --> 19:13.543
I also learned
that those bags are kept

19:13.587 --> 19:14.936
in a far more secure area
of the storage locker

19:14.979 --> 19:16.459
than the members' bags.

19:16.503 --> 19:18.374
That's odd.
If you're gonna steal clubs,

19:18.418 --> 19:20.376
why not get the ones
that are easier to grab?

19:20.420 --> 19:23.292
Right? May I?

19:23.336 --> 19:25.555
Yeah, yeah.

19:27.035 --> 19:28.341
It's gonna take

19:28.384 --> 19:30.343
just a minute
to get past the firewall.

19:30.386 --> 19:34.260
You know, I know you're
in character, but, uh,

19:34.303 --> 19:36.566
you seem to really fit
in here. Thought you said

19:36.610 --> 19:38.220
your dad was like a tough,
blue-collar kind of guy.

19:38.264 --> 19:39.700
He was, but,

19:39.743 --> 19:41.658
you know,
my mum was kind of posh.

19:41.702 --> 19:43.094
So, who do you take after--
your mom or your dad?

19:43.138 --> 19:45.227
I think I take after them both.

19:46.272 --> 19:49.013
I couldn't agree more.

19:51.842 --> 19:53.453
I'm in.

19:53.496 --> 19:56.107
All right,
- so according to Club2
- Club,

19:56.151 --> 19:57.935
three bags were delivered
to Ko 'Opua,

19:57.979 --> 19:59.589
but according to Ko 'Opua,

19:59.633 --> 20:01.765
those bags were never logged
into their system.

20:01.809 --> 20:04.551
That's weird, because only
two bags were reported stolen.

20:04.594 --> 20:07.075
Why didn't the owner of the
third bag report it missing?

20:07.118 --> 20:09.120
- It's just strange.
- It gets stranger.

20:09.164 --> 20:11.079
Most shipments made
- by Club2
- Club are round trip,

20:11.122 --> 20:13.081
but the stolen bag
that wasn't reported missing

20:13.124 --> 20:14.865
was only shipped one way.

20:14.909 --> 20:17.607
In fact, that account
only ever ships bags one way.

20:18.739 --> 20:21.263
Each time
from South Africa to Oahu.

20:21.307 --> 20:22.917
South Africa's one of the
world's largest producers

20:22.960 --> 20:24.440
of platinum, diamonds,

20:24.484 --> 20:26.312
and a bunch of other
very expensive things.

20:26.355 --> 20:28.792
My gut is saying
- that someone is using Club2
- Club

20:28.836 --> 20:30.577
to smuggle a bunch of goods.

20:30.620 --> 20:32.579
Well, the average weight
of the bags shipped

20:32.622 --> 20:35.321
by that account
is 135 pounds.

20:35.364 --> 20:37.236
An actual set of clubs is, what,

20:37.279 --> 20:39.063
- 30 pounds?
- If that.

20:39.107 --> 20:41.240
Somebody's definitely shipping
something other than clubs.

20:41.283 --> 20:43.677
Yeah. I think your gut is right.

20:47.681 --> 20:49.422
You think the thief knew
there was something other

20:49.465 --> 20:50.945
than golf clubs
in that bag?

20:50.988 --> 20:52.512
I'm not sure.

20:52.555 --> 20:53.861
I mean, they could have just
been trying to steal clubs

20:53.904 --> 20:55.515
and then stumbled
upon the smuggled goods.

20:55.558 --> 20:57.256
Do you know who
it was addressed to?

20:57.299 --> 20:59.301
Because if the thief did know,
that could be a lead.

20:59.345 --> 21:01.172
Yeah. It was addressed
to a John Mills,

21:01.216 --> 21:02.826
which doesn't match
any of the members' names.

21:02.870 --> 21:04.393
I mean, it might
just be an alias

21:04.437 --> 21:06.134
that the smuggler's using
to personally pick up.

21:06.177 --> 21:08.223
Or he could have an inside man.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.443
Or an inside woman.

21:10.486 --> 21:13.010
Why is it always
an inside man?

21:13.054 --> 21:15.752
Women are just as capable
of being... inside.

21:15.796 --> 21:17.580
Erin, how long you
been listening?

21:17.624 --> 21:20.322
Not very. But it sounds like
you're up to something sneaky.

21:20.366 --> 21:22.455
Is this related

21:22.498 --> 21:25.806
to why L.R. unplugged
that security camera earlier?

21:25.849 --> 21:26.850
L.R.?

21:26.894 --> 21:28.069
Latin Rick.

21:30.071 --> 21:32.073
Look, I'm happy to
keep my mouth shut

21:32.116 --> 21:33.988
for whatever it is
you're up to...

21:35.119 --> 21:36.904
...if Rick gives me his number.

21:40.255 --> 21:41.822
You ready
for the back nine, Harper?

21:41.865 --> 21:44.520
Uh, yeah. I'm-I'm coming.

21:44.564 --> 21:45.739
Accent change.

21:47.175 --> 21:49.090
This is getting juicier
by the second.

21:49.133 --> 21:50.700
Take one for the team.

21:51.701 --> 21:53.660
Right. I'm gonna keep
pressing Stan.

21:53.703 --> 21:56.097
I'm gonna go see if I can track
down the Rolex-wearing caddie.

21:56.140 --> 21:57.751
So,

21:57.794 --> 22:00.144
how about that number?

22:00.188 --> 22:03.757
If you stay quiet about this,
I'll give it to you.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.107
- Yeah, you will.
- My number.

22:07.978 --> 22:10.285
Look, I'm not open to dating.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.418
It's not just you.
It's anybody.

22:12.461 --> 22:14.376
You really did get out
of something.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.117
It's not an excuse?

22:16.160 --> 22:18.685
No, no, it's not.
Somebody very special to me

22:18.728 --> 22:20.948
is kind of out of my life
right now.

22:21.949 --> 22:23.951
I actually just got out
of something, too,

22:23.994 --> 22:25.518
but not like you.

22:27.258 --> 22:30.610
I escaped a bad situation
with a really possessive guy,

22:30.653 --> 22:32.960
and it wasn't good.

22:33.003 --> 22:35.092
I'm sorry you had
to go through that.

22:36.485 --> 22:38.705
But I'm happy
you're out of it now.

22:38.748 --> 22:40.315
Everyone here thinks

22:40.359 --> 22:42.926
I'm just a party girl
having a midlife crisis,

22:42.970 --> 22:44.798
but the truth is,

22:44.841 --> 22:47.148
I missed out on my prime.

22:49.324 --> 22:52.066
I'm just trying to enjoy
the life I never got to live.

22:57.245 --> 22:59.290
And after I aced
medical school, I was like,

22:59.334 --> 23:01.945
"Do I really want to be
Oahu's best heart surgeon?"

23:01.989 --> 23:04.165
That's when I started
investing in Bitcoin.

23:08.474 --> 23:11.215
One day. It's all tied up
in the businesses I own.

23:11.259 --> 23:14.828
La Mariana, my ABC Stores,
Island Hoppers.

23:18.919 --> 23:21.356
Yeah, I just don't want
to brag about it.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.185
I have a lot of great ideas
to make things way better

23:24.228 --> 23:25.621
than they are.

23:25.665 --> 23:27.188
Mm.

23:30.365 --> 23:31.975
Virgin Lava Flow
for the young lady.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.196
And for you, Jin--

23:35.239 --> 23:39.374
your usual-- half coffee,
half orange juice,

23:39.418 --> 23:41.289
with a shot of tabasco.

23:41.332 --> 23:43.857
Yay, my usual.

23:45.989 --> 23:47.513
Why don't you go ahead
and take a sip,

23:47.556 --> 23:49.906
make sure I made it
just the way you like it?

23:49.950 --> 23:52.213
That's a good idea, TC.

23:52.256 --> 23:54.215
Yeah.

23:54.258 --> 23:55.825
Right.

24:13.277 --> 24:17.107
Ah. "Thursday is Bring Hoa Aloha
to School Day.

24:17.151 --> 24:19.980
"Bring in someone special--
a grown-up, relative or friend--

24:20.023 --> 24:22.765
to talk about what they do."

24:25.464 --> 24:28.815
You want to bring me to school?

24:30.556 --> 24:32.732
What an honor.

24:32.775 --> 24:35.474
Um, but I'm pretty busy
next week.

24:36.910 --> 24:38.955
I probably wouldn't be able
to attend.

24:53.622 --> 24:56.103
You got to be kidding me.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.454
What are you doing?

24:59.498 --> 25:00.977
Plates and cups first.
Terry in the back said

25:01.021 --> 25:02.544
I needed
to separate the silverware.

25:02.588 --> 25:05.112
Terry in the back? And where'd
you get that shirt?

25:05.155 --> 25:07.070
It was hanging on the wall.

25:07.114 --> 25:08.898
That's 'cause it's for sale.

25:08.942 --> 25:11.118
Look, dude, you can't just
start working somewhere,

25:11.161 --> 25:12.859
especially after I told you
no, like, six times.

25:12.902 --> 25:15.514
Now take that shirt off
and get out of here

25:15.557 --> 25:17.080
before I really lay it down.

25:17.124 --> 25:18.647
Okay.

25:21.911 --> 25:23.913
I'm sorry.

25:23.957 --> 25:27.395
What's a kid like you need a job
so bad for anyway?

25:28.396 --> 25:31.617
There's an old Chevy on sale.
900 bucks.

25:31.660 --> 25:34.228
It's a clunker,
but it runs.

25:34.271 --> 25:35.751
Kids like me--
we got to earn it,

25:35.795 --> 25:37.536
so I got to start saving now.

25:39.146 --> 25:41.975
I get where you're coming from.
Believe me.

25:42.018 --> 25:44.934
But you can't just
start working somewhere.

25:44.978 --> 25:46.022
That's crazy.

25:46.066 --> 25:48.808
I know.

25:50.374 --> 25:52.333
I'll tell you what.

25:52.376 --> 25:54.596
In the parking lot, there's
an orange and brown van.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.598
Now, you mentioned washing cars.

25:56.642 --> 26:00.254
You do a good job detailing it,
there's 50 bucks in it for you.

26:00.297 --> 26:01.777
You serious?

26:01.821 --> 26:04.127
I said <i>if</i> you do a good job.

26:04.171 --> 26:05.912
Deal.

26:07.696 --> 26:08.871
All right.

26:16.966 --> 26:18.838
Ooh, look at that.

26:18.881 --> 26:21.449
That is a nice-looking replica.

26:21.492 --> 26:23.451
I got a...
got a knock-off myself.

26:23.494 --> 26:25.105
No, man. This is real, dude.

26:25.148 --> 26:26.585
- Is that real?
- Yeah.

26:26.628 --> 26:28.587
Let me see that.
Got the sapphire dial.

26:28.630 --> 26:31.067
Got the Rolex crown
in the back.

26:31.111 --> 26:33.156
Got a Rolex guy
- you can hook me up with?
- Nah, man.

26:33.200 --> 26:34.854
It's just a family watch.
Granddad gave it to my dad

26:34.897 --> 26:37.552
when he was a kid,
and now it's mine.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.859
Well, you are a lucky guy.

26:39.902 --> 26:41.338
Enjoy your round.

26:46.996 --> 26:48.432
Hey, where are you?

26:48.476 --> 26:50.652
Walking back,
and I got some news.

26:50.696 --> 26:52.132
Caddie's Rolex is real,

26:52.175 --> 26:53.655
so he's lying
about where he got it from.

26:53.699 --> 26:55.396
How do you know?

26:55.439 --> 26:57.790
Well, because that Submariner's
from the early 2000s,

26:57.833 --> 26:59.313
so there's no way
it could've been handed down

26:59.356 --> 27:00.749
through generations
like he said.

27:00.793 --> 27:02.272
Okay, well,
we'll keep tabs on him.

27:02.316 --> 27:03.622
My news is better.

27:03.665 --> 27:05.232
You know
this isn't a competition, right?

27:05.275 --> 27:07.582
True, but my news
is objectively bigger.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.584
Kumu called and said that none
of the local pawnshops

27:09.628 --> 27:11.847
have had anyone try
to sell them any golf clubs.

27:11.891 --> 27:13.806
But one guy had
a customer come in

27:13.849 --> 27:16.983
and try to sell him ivory tusks
out of a gold travel bag.

27:17.026 --> 27:19.202
Unfortunately, security camera
didn't capture his face.

27:19.246 --> 27:23.032
Oh, ivory would warrant
an illegal smuggling operation.

27:23.076 --> 27:25.208
Plus, it would explain
the weight of the bag.

27:25.252 --> 27:27.776
Mm-hmm. We have
to notify HPD.

27:31.258 --> 27:33.086
What do you need, Magnum?

27:33.129 --> 27:34.783
So, uh, we're working a case,

27:34.827 --> 27:36.785
and we uncovered
an illegal smuggling operation.

27:36.829 --> 27:38.918
Who are the major players
in ivory dealing?

27:38.961 --> 27:41.094
There's only one. Zev Marker.

27:41.137 --> 27:42.748
He's as slippery
as he is dangerous.

27:42.791 --> 27:44.837
Never been able
to pin anything on him because

27:44.880 --> 27:46.447
we could never figure out
how he got his shipments in.

27:46.490 --> 27:47.666
They got something on Zev?

27:48.710 --> 27:50.756
We're trying to track down a bag

27:50.799 --> 27:53.367
with 135 pounds' worth
of ivory in it.

27:53.410 --> 27:54.716
I'm gonna look
into this Zev guy

27:54.760 --> 27:56.413
and see
if there's any connection.

27:56.457 --> 27:57.676
Great. The black market price

27:57.719 --> 27:59.025
for ivory's about
$1,500 a pound.

27:59.068 --> 28:01.288
So that bag's worth
over 200 grand.

28:01.331 --> 28:03.812
If that's just one shipment,
th-this guy's a big part

28:03.856 --> 28:05.466
of the illegal
ivory trade here.

28:05.509 --> 28:06.815
I mean, these
people are awful.

28:06.859 --> 28:08.512
Tens of thousands of
elephants are killed

28:08.556 --> 28:10.036
every year for
their tusks.

28:10.079 --> 28:12.429
Yeah, definitely keep us
in the loop on this one.

28:12.473 --> 28:14.475
If your case is connected
to Zev, we need to know.

28:14.518 --> 28:16.520
Yeah, we will,
absolutely. Thank you.

28:18.174 --> 28:19.959
What's that look?

28:20.002 --> 28:21.612
I like your girlfriend.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.358
All right. Looks like Zev is
trying to hide his financials

28:28.402 --> 28:30.012
using accounts with aliases,

28:30.056 --> 28:32.885
but he made all his transactions
on his laptop,

28:32.928 --> 28:36.584
- including payments to Club2
- Club
for multiple shipping orders.

28:36.627 --> 28:38.760
- That's our guy.
- Yeah, and he landed

28:38.804 --> 28:41.589
in Oahu today from South Africa
via Los Angeles.

28:41.632 --> 28:45.201
I'm gonna ping him now. Wait.

28:45.245 --> 28:46.637
Looks like he's close
to Trevor's apartment.

28:46.681 --> 28:48.335
Yeah, and he's
moving closer.

28:48.378 --> 28:50.685
If Zev is trying
to track down his ivory,

28:50.729 --> 28:51.904
and he's found out
that the club

28:51.947 --> 28:53.209
is pinning the stolen bag
on Trevor...

28:53.253 --> 28:55.124
- Then Trevor's in danger.
- Yeah.

28:58.301 --> 29:00.260
Ah, that's a great stroke.

29:00.303 --> 29:02.784
220 yards right on the green...

29:02.828 --> 29:04.394
Hello?

29:04.438 --> 29:07.049
- Trevor, listen to me carefully.
- Mr. Magnum?

29:07.093 --> 29:09.312
Armed men are pulling up
to your house any second now.

29:09.356 --> 29:10.836
What? Why?

29:10.879 --> 29:12.620
They think you have something
of theirs, right?

29:12.663 --> 29:13.969
But tell 'em you don't have it,
but you know who does.

29:14.013 --> 29:15.492
What do you mean? Who?

29:15.536 --> 29:17.538
Me. Tell 'em I have
what they're looking for.

29:17.581 --> 29:19.192
That is the only thing
that's gonna keep you alive.

29:19.235 --> 29:21.890
Oh, hey, hey, hey. Hey, no,
no, no. What are you doing?

29:21.934 --> 29:23.718
What are you doing?!
No, no, no!

29:23.762 --> 29:25.372
No!

29:48.525 --> 29:51.224
He's gone.

29:53.922 --> 29:55.794
It's Trevor.

29:57.317 --> 29:59.058
Don't bother tracing this.

29:59.101 --> 30:00.929
I'm tossing his cell
right after you agree

30:00.973 --> 30:02.583
to give me back my ivory.

30:02.626 --> 30:04.498
As long as you return
our friend unharmed,

30:04.541 --> 30:06.543
we can work something out,
but I'm gonna need time.

30:06.587 --> 30:08.502
I'll call you in four hours.

30:08.545 --> 30:11.679
Nah. Nah, nah, nah.
I call you.

30:11.722 --> 30:13.246
You make sure you have my bag.

30:13.289 --> 30:14.508
And you got two hours.

30:16.205 --> 30:18.860
We have two hours
to trade Trevor for the ivory.

30:18.904 --> 30:20.906
Great. Only problem is,

30:20.949 --> 30:22.995
we don't have the ivory.

30:35.050 --> 30:36.182
You got to be kidding me.

30:37.226 --> 30:40.708
Nope. Did the exterior trim,

30:40.751 --> 30:42.492
dressed the tires,
and treated the vinyl.

30:42.536 --> 30:43.711
Check under the hood.

30:48.890 --> 30:51.893
Damn!

30:51.937 --> 30:53.808
You could eat off this engine.

30:53.852 --> 30:56.637
I'm still not done. Haven't even
shampooed the mats yet.

30:56.680 --> 31:01.033
You know what?
You got the job.

31:01.076 --> 31:03.949
I know. We already shook on it.
You owe me 50 bucks.

31:03.992 --> 31:06.299
No, I'm talking about the job
at La Mariana.

31:06.342 --> 31:08.301
You're kidding.

31:08.344 --> 31:11.043
Nope. You keep up this level
of hustling

31:11.086 --> 31:13.915
and attention to detail, we'll
find something for you to do.

31:13.959 --> 31:15.221
Yes!

31:16.352 --> 31:18.050
Thank you.

31:18.093 --> 31:19.790
Thank you. Thank you.

31:19.834 --> 31:22.358
Okay, kid.
Just don't let me down.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.109
Hey, you all right?

31:34.153 --> 31:36.111
Yeah, yeah.
Joon is playing pool,

31:36.155 --> 31:38.592
and I wanted to catch
some fresh air. I'm fine.

31:38.635 --> 31:39.854
Okay.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.464
Hey, where are you going?

31:41.508 --> 31:43.292
Said you were fine.

31:43.336 --> 31:45.904
Yeah, but I said it in a way
that was obvious that I'm not.

31:45.947 --> 31:47.993
It's called a cry for help, TC.

31:48.036 --> 31:50.212
Jin, what's on your mind?

31:51.997 --> 31:54.042
I remember when I used
to send my sister money.

31:54.086 --> 31:55.870
I couldn't tell Joon
that the money was

31:55.914 --> 31:59.178
from pulling shady jobs,
so I lied about what I did.

31:59.221 --> 32:01.180
And then she started
looking up to me,

32:01.223 --> 32:02.398
and I lied some more,

32:02.442 --> 32:03.965
and I lied some more.

32:04.009 --> 32:05.924
And it's finally
caught up to me.

32:05.967 --> 32:09.144
That's why you didn't want to go
to her school thing-- Hoa Aloha.

32:09.188 --> 32:12.104
I mean, I want to, but I have
to clear the air first,

32:12.147 --> 32:14.845
and... that's heavy.

32:14.889 --> 32:18.197
It is, but if there's
one thing I learned today,

32:18.240 --> 32:20.982
it's that you'd be surprised at
what these kids are capable of.

32:21.026 --> 32:23.158
Look, Joon's
a strong girl.

32:23.202 --> 32:24.855
I'm sure
if you told her the truth,

32:24.899 --> 32:26.205
she'll be able to handle it.

32:34.082 --> 32:36.998
Whoa. Coming in hot.
This about our bet?

32:37.042 --> 32:38.260
No, you can keep your money.

32:38.304 --> 32:39.827
We just want
to ask you some questions.

32:39.870 --> 32:42.090
What questions?
And what's with your voice?

32:42.134 --> 32:43.874
I've dropped the act,
and now so should you.

32:43.918 --> 32:45.267
We're private investigators
working on a case

32:45.311 --> 32:47.139
that you are now
in the middle of

32:47.182 --> 32:49.532
since you claimed to have seen
Trevor steal some golf clubs.

32:49.576 --> 32:51.882
You're doing an investigation
over stolen clubs?

32:57.149 --> 32:59.803
Look, I just thought
he'd get a slap on the wrist.

32:59.847 --> 33:01.675
I didn't think
he'd lose his job.

33:01.718 --> 33:04.286
No, this is about a lot more
than somebody losing their job.

33:04.330 --> 33:07.289
- What do you mean?
- There was something else
in that bag

33:07.333 --> 33:09.552
that belongs to somebody who
you don't want to mess with.

33:09.596 --> 33:11.032
And now Trevor's life
is at stake,

33:11.076 --> 33:12.120
so you have
to tell us what you know.

33:12.164 --> 33:14.122
Okay.

33:14.166 --> 33:17.560
Uh, look, w-work's been slow.

33:17.604 --> 33:19.040
I was behind on
my golf dues

33:19.084 --> 33:20.955
and on the brink of
losing my membership.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.392
I actually saw
who stole the clubs.

33:24.306 --> 33:27.396
It was Jaime, the
manager, so I texted him,

33:27.440 --> 33:30.269
and we worked out a deal that
if I threw Trevor under the bus,

33:30.312 --> 33:31.792
that he'd wipe out my dues

33:31.835 --> 33:33.141
and put me in
good standing.

33:33.185 --> 33:37.058
I didn't think
it'd get this serious.

33:38.233 --> 33:39.539
Look,

33:39.582 --> 33:40.670
if there's anything else
I can do...

33:40.714 --> 33:41.671
Yeah.

33:41.715 --> 33:42.846
Unlock your phone.

33:49.549 --> 33:52.813
Look, I really am sorry.

33:52.856 --> 33:54.075
Well, you better hope
we get what we need

33:54.119 --> 33:55.598
from Jaime for Trevor's sake.

34:10.265 --> 34:11.440
- He's running.
- Yeah.

34:46.345 --> 34:48.042
Wait, wait, wait.
What are you doing?

34:49.565 --> 34:51.306
Oh, my God.

35:14.808 --> 35:17.898
You know, that's a surprisingly
good look for you.

35:17.941 --> 35:20.074
- Blue car?
Stolen car.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.554
I didn't have a choice.

35:28.169 --> 35:30.258
Well, let's hope
the owner has good insurance.

35:30.302 --> 35:31.738
Why? You're the reckless one.
Remind me

35:31.781 --> 35:34.784
how many blemishes
the 488 has suffered.

35:34.828 --> 35:36.656
That were my fault? None.

35:43.576 --> 35:45.186
Okay, I have an idea.

35:45.230 --> 35:46.796
Does it involve hoping
the car has full coverage?

35:46.840 --> 35:49.756
Unfortunately, yes.

35:56.197 --> 35:57.590
Okay, I'm coming up next to him.

35:57.633 --> 35:59.548
All right.
I'll clear the cars behind us.

36:22.963 --> 36:24.225
Where's the ivory?

36:24.269 --> 36:25.487
I don't have it.
I swear to God.

36:25.531 --> 36:27.359
- Please don't kill me.
- Kill you?

36:27.402 --> 36:29.143
You're with the
smugglers, right?

36:29.970 --> 36:31.972
No, but those men took Trevor

36:32.015 --> 36:34.670
because of you,
so we need that ivory.

36:34.714 --> 36:36.759
- Now!
- I honestly don't have it.

36:36.803 --> 36:38.544
When I couldn't unload it and
learned how much heat there was,

36:38.587 --> 36:40.981
I threw it in the ocean.

36:41.024 --> 36:42.461
It's gone, I swear.

36:44.419 --> 36:46.204
Okay, come on.

36:46.247 --> 36:47.379
Sit down.

36:50.512 --> 36:51.948
- I believe him.
- Yeah.

36:51.992 --> 36:53.559
Thing is, we have 30 minutes

36:53.602 --> 36:55.474
to make the trade,
and nothing to trade with.

36:55.517 --> 36:57.345
- We're out of moves.
- No, maybe not.

36:57.389 --> 36:59.391
We get back to the club,
we got to find Benji.

36:59.434 --> 37:01.958
The caddie with the Rolex
- we saw on the security footage?
- Yeah.

37:03.873 --> 37:07.703
Hey, it's me.
I need a favor.

37:29.943 --> 37:30.465
So,

37:30.509 --> 37:31.988
where is my bag?

37:32.032 --> 37:34.426
Did you expect me
to bring 135 pounds of ivory?

37:34.469 --> 37:36.254
I mean, have you seen the
trunk space in these things?

37:36.297 --> 37:37.820
You can barely fit
groceries in 'em.

37:37.864 --> 37:40.693
You know, if you want
your friend back alive,

37:40.736 --> 37:42.869
you need to give me my bag.

37:42.912 --> 37:45.001
I don't think so.

37:45.045 --> 37:47.134
You're gonna give me Trevor, and
we're gonna drive out of here.

37:49.179 --> 37:51.138
And what makes you think
I'd do that?

37:51.181 --> 37:52.748
Because my partner's
at your stash house.

37:52.792 --> 37:55.751
If I'm not out of here
in 58 seconds with Trevor,

37:55.795 --> 37:57.144
she's gonna burn
your mother lode

37:57.187 --> 37:58.232
of ivory down to the ground.

37:58.276 --> 37:59.712
Yeah, nice try.

37:59.755 --> 38:01.757
I got a man on guard.

38:01.801 --> 38:04.456
You mean, uh,

38:04.499 --> 38:06.545
this guy?

38:08.938 --> 38:10.723
How did you...?

38:10.766 --> 38:13.813
Find your place? We talked
to your inside guy at the club.

38:13.856 --> 38:16.206
Benji, I believe his name is.
Very helpful.

38:17.947 --> 38:18.948
You got 30 seconds.

38:18.992 --> 38:20.167
You're bluffing.

38:20.210 --> 38:22.648
You won't burn anything down

38:22.691 --> 38:24.650
as long as I got the kid.

38:24.693 --> 38:27.261
You want to find out, you're
working with 20 seconds now.

38:30.569 --> 38:32.614
Look, I just want Trevor.

38:32.658 --> 38:34.442
All right? I don't care
about your ivory.

38:52.286 --> 38:54.549
Now text your partner.

39:02.949 --> 39:04.994
It's done.

39:06.779 --> 39:09.347
Like I said, I don't
care about your ivory.

39:10.870 --> 39:13.742
They might.

39:19.444 --> 39:21.837
Hands! Hey! Look,
let me see your hands.

39:23.317 --> 39:24.840
Go, go, go!

39:26.364 --> 39:27.756
Hands! Keep your hands up!

39:29.584 --> 39:30.629
Move!

39:32.935 --> 39:34.197
That's it. Don't move.

39:44.294 --> 39:46.035
I have something important
to tell you,

39:46.079 --> 39:48.124
and I want
to enunciate it clearly.

39:50.083 --> 39:52.390
Okay, so, a lot of the stories

39:52.433 --> 39:53.913
that I told you
about what I do--

39:53.956 --> 39:56.959
well, they're just
that-- stories.

40:00.354 --> 40:03.226
Uh, the... the truth is,

40:03.270 --> 40:06.447
when I helped you and your
mother out back in the day,

40:06.491 --> 40:09.755
I had to do a lot of jobs
that I'm not proud of.

40:09.798 --> 40:11.757
Jobs that you might not want

40:11.800 --> 40:14.063
your Uncle Jin
telling your classmates.

40:15.456 --> 40:17.806
Why are you smiling?

40:23.986 --> 40:27.729
You still want me to come?

40:39.437 --> 40:43.571
That will never change.

40:45.181 --> 40:48.228
You know, I don't know what
I'm gonna tell your class.

40:48.271 --> 40:51.100
I'm out of work,
I literally have nothing.

40:51.144 --> 40:54.190
All I have is that stupid
mobile billboard thing.

40:59.369 --> 41:00.849
That's right.

41:00.893 --> 41:02.634
I'm in advertising.

41:02.677 --> 41:04.636
Imagine all the things
that I could advertise.

41:04.679 --> 41:07.552
Like, you know, um,
toothpaste or a law firm

41:07.595 --> 41:10.511
or, you know, exotic animals,
like a honey badger,

41:10.555 --> 41:14.472
or, like, high-tech
oven mitts. Who knows?

41:17.562 --> 41:20.521
♪ Love is what you find when it
ain't what you're looking for ♪

41:20.565 --> 41:24.090
♪ I ain't looking
for love no more ♪

41:24.133 --> 41:26.962
♪ I ain't
looking for love no more ♪

41:27.006 --> 41:29.530
♪ 'Cause love is what you find

41:29.574 --> 41:32.620
♪ When it ain't
what you're looking for... ♪

41:35.231 --> 41:36.537
How's Ethan?

41:36.581 --> 41:38.539
Oh, he's great.

41:38.583 --> 41:40.585
He's so great
that he's gonna stay

41:40.628 --> 41:43.109
in Kenya for another six months.

41:43.152 --> 41:45.503
Oh. Are you serious?
You okay?

41:45.546 --> 41:49.028
I'm fine. But I would be better
with a drink in my hand.

41:49.071 --> 41:50.116
I'm on it.

41:50.159 --> 41:51.857
Hey, guys.

41:51.900 --> 41:53.206
Hey, how you doing?

41:53.249 --> 41:55.382
- Good to see you, man.
- What's up, man?

41:55.425 --> 41:56.470
- Have a beer.
- Oh, thank you.

41:56.514 --> 41:57.863
Appreciate it. Um,

41:57.906 --> 41:59.299
just wanted to say thanks.

41:59.342 --> 42:01.040
Not only is
Ko 'Opua my sponsor again.

42:01.083 --> 42:03.346
They felt so bad about what
happened that they gifted me

42:03.390 --> 42:05.392
a full membership to the club.

42:05.435 --> 42:06.611
- Oh!
- That is amazing!

42:06.654 --> 42:08.264
- Congratulations.
- Cheers.

42:08.308 --> 42:09.614
Congratulations.
Nice. Congratulations.

42:09.657 --> 42:11.572
- That's so exciting.
- Ooh.

42:11.616 --> 42:14.140
Yo, table nine's asking
for another round.

42:14.183 --> 42:15.663
Okay, copy that.

42:15.707 --> 42:17.491
Also, who the hell are you?

42:17.535 --> 42:19.537
Cade. TC hired me.
It was nice to meet you.

42:19.580 --> 42:20.929
There you go.

42:20.973 --> 42:23.541
I've been meaning
- to tell you.
- Uh-huh. Huh.

42:23.584 --> 42:24.890
Rick, I tried to warn him not

42:24.933 --> 42:25.978
to hire anybody
without your permission.

42:26.021 --> 42:27.327
Oh, thank you, Jin. Thank you.

42:27.370 --> 42:29.285
Are you serious? Oh, I tried...

42:29.329 --> 42:31.592
You know, now is not the time.
My friend Erin's here. Erin!

42:31.636 --> 42:33.463
Erin, hi!
Hey, there she is.

42:33.507 --> 42:38.251
Me! Oh, my God,
this place is amazing.

42:38.294 --> 42:41.123
This is great, Rick.
Thank you for the invite.

42:41.167 --> 42:42.385
Oh, come on. Of course.

42:42.429 --> 42:44.083
I mean,
why settle for one number

42:44.126 --> 42:45.867
when you can have 20,
am I right?

42:47.303 --> 42:49.479
- So much fresh meat.
- Uh-oh.

42:49.523 --> 42:51.220
I feel like
The Bachelorette.

42:54.093 --> 42:55.616
Okay, I'm going in.

42:55.660 --> 42:58.880
Easy, tiger.

42:58.924 --> 43:00.316
This I got to see.

43:00.360 --> 43:01.796
Somebody should warn them.

43:01.840 --> 43:03.885
Cheers to The Bachelorette.
