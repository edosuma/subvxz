00:10.261 --> 00:11.341
(grunting)

00:14.265 --> 00:16.176
(panting)

00:38.456 --> 00:40.367
(rumbling)

00:44.337 --> 00:45.543
Hello, John.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.762
Oh, at last.

00:54.305 --> 00:56.216
At last.

00:58.267 --> 00:59.803
( growls )

01:01.437 --> 01:03.769
( beeping )

01:03.856 --> 01:05.312
Yes?

01:05.399 --> 01:09.233
Brace:
Sorry to wake you, sir, but I
think we've finally done it.

01:10.196 --> 01:12.232
On my way.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.343
Crichton.

01:39.850 --> 01:41.465
Pilot, can we keep going?

01:41.560 --> 01:44.927
We can do anything if the
others want to, but...

01:45.022 --> 01:47.058
Chiana:
Well, then, can we turn around?

01:47.149 --> 01:49.686
lam sick of running to the
ends of the fekik just because
he's got a balliun up his butt.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.278
Crichton:
I have explained this to you.

01:51.362 --> 01:53.148
You have explained it
to all of us.

01:53.239 --> 01:55.480
Over and over and over.

01:55.574 --> 01:59.283
The deep space variances we
encountered indicate
that we could...

01:59.370 --> 02:01.452
We could be somewhere
near a wormhole.

02:01.539 --> 02:04.827
The variances could also
indicate a trillion
other possibilities

02:04.917 --> 02:07.875
none of which have anything
to do with wormholes.

02:07.962 --> 02:10.374
Guys, I know that you
have been patient.

02:10.464 --> 02:13.627
Oh, no more. I've had it up to
parsac's bow with patience.

02:13.718 --> 02:15.754
Pip, no, Chia... come on.
Chiana, don't, don't, don't.

02:15.845 --> 02:17.381
Pilot, get us out of here.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.508
Crichton:
Don't! Look, remember the
ship in the wormhole?

02:20.599 --> 02:23.466
I saw the Three Stooges.
The broadcast.

02:23.561 --> 02:25.017
I'm with Miss Monochrome.

02:25.104 --> 02:27.595
Let's just get the frell
out of here.

02:29.191 --> 02:31.978
D, come on, man.
Look, it's the Stooges.

02:32.069 --> 02:33.605
( imitating Curly of
the Three Stooges )

02:33.696 --> 02:35.687
I gotta, I gotta...

02:35.781 --> 02:37.646
Look, you know, it's Earth,
it's home.

02:37.742 --> 02:42.202
I know, I'm a little... a
little obsessive, but I gotta.

02:42.288 --> 02:46.827
John, we have been searching
for ten solar days.

02:46.917 --> 02:48.498
I mean, come on,
enough is enough.

02:48.586 --> 02:50.372
You saw that broadcast
through a wormhole,

02:50.463 --> 02:54.832
and you know as well as I do
your home could be anywhere.

02:55.301 --> 02:56.461
Hmm.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.174
Pilot, you game to continue?

03:05.269 --> 03:08.136
I'm afraid the others
would object.

03:08.230 --> 03:10.687
But there's something
else now, too.

03:10.775 --> 03:11.981
What?

03:12.068 --> 03:14.309
Moya's approaching an
electromagnetic cluster.

03:14.403 --> 03:17.941
All her scans indicate
it's benign, but...

03:18.032 --> 03:20.318
(rumbling)

03:20.409 --> 03:21.865
That was the cluster, right?

03:21.952 --> 03:23.613
We just passed through it.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.820
(rumbling)

03:26.457 --> 03:27.913
Pilot, are we okay?

03:28.000 --> 03:30.412
Everything seems fine.

03:31.379 --> 03:32.744
Oh, boy.

03:45.601 --> 03:48.388
Pilot, there's something in...

03:51.148 --> 03:54.106
Is anybody having any...
problems?

04:18.259 --> 04:20.625
My name is John Crichton...
I'm lost...
an astronaut.

04:20.719 --> 04:24.428
I got shot through
a wormhole...
In some distant part of the universe...

04:24.515 --> 04:26.096
I'm trying to stay alive...

04:26.183 --> 04:28.094
Aboard this ship...
This living ship...

04:28.185 --> 04:30.892
Of escaped prisoners.
My friends.

04:30.980 --> 04:32.436
If you can hear me...
Beware.

04:32.523 --> 04:34.514
lfl make it back...
Will they follow?

04:34.608 --> 04:37.315
If I open the door...
Are you ready?

04:37.403 --> 04:41.817
Earth is unprepared...
Helpless,
for the nightmares I've seen.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.239
Or should I stay...
Protect my home...

04:44.326 --> 04:46.783
Not show them...
You exist...

04:46.871 --> 04:50.614
But then you will never know
the wonders I've seen.

05:37.254 --> 05:39.085
D'Argo?

05:39.173 --> 05:41.255
Chiana, where are you?

05:42.593 --> 05:44.254
(sighs)

05:44.345 --> 05:45.334
Pilot!

05:45.429 --> 05:47.044
What's the matter, Crichton?

05:47.139 --> 05:49.175
Light... came in here.

05:49.266 --> 05:51.757
Moya's senses registered
nothing.

05:51.852 --> 05:57.222
Oh, look, right after the
cluster I said that...
that light it...

06:02.404 --> 06:04.190
(yelling ):
Abbot!

06:04.281 --> 06:06.613
Chiana:
Crichton!

06:06.700 --> 06:08.110
Hey, what's the matter?
-Chiana.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.783
You okay? You all right?
-Yeah, yeah, I'm fine,
yeah, yeah.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.280
You look terrible.
What's the matter?

06:11.372 --> 06:13.237
l... l... the light that
came into Moya.

06:13.332 --> 06:17.245
It went through me, and...
and itjust... like... I bled.

06:17.336 --> 06:19.201
Boom, boom...

06:19.296 --> 06:20.081
| bled.

06:20.172 --> 06:23.130
Am I cut?
-Let me see.

06:23.217 --> 06:24.673
Am I cut?
-No, there'snothing there.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.296
You sure?

06:26.720 --> 06:27.880
Oh, yeah!

06:27.972 --> 06:29.963
(giggles )
Are you sure you bled?

06:30.057 --> 06:32.343
Yes, | bled! You don't
make some... .

06:32.434 --> 06:34.049
Like a... it was like
a lake of blood.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.270
It was biblical.
-Uh, Crichton,

06:35.354 --> 06:37.185
you've barely eaten or slept
in ten solar days.

06:37.273 --> 06:38.934
Maybe you imagined it.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.980
Nobody imagines things
like this.

06:44.446 --> 06:46.653
g’giﬁk ’1 i

06:46.740 --> 06:48.355
Right here.

06:49.410 --> 06:50.445
What?

06:50.536 --> 06:51.776
What am I supposed to
be looking at?

06:51.870 --> 06:54.407
There was blood, blood.
It was right here.

06:54.498 --> 06:55.738
Pilot, did you...

06:55.833 --> 06:57.369
did you register an electric
surge down here?

06:57.459 --> 07:00.246
Nothing. I told Crichton that.

07:01.422 --> 07:02.832
What, what do you, what
are you looking at?

07:02.923 --> 07:05.039
Do you think I'm
making this up?

07:05.134 --> 07:06.715
All right.

07:06.802 --> 07:08.008
Go eat.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.960
And then go bathe,
because you stink.

07:10.723 --> 07:12.213
( sniffing )

07:12.975 --> 07:14.135
Hold still.

07:14.226 --> 07:16.512
Hold still, and
quit your whining.

07:16.604 --> 07:19.391
You know you've got my
blood in here.

07:19.481 --> 07:21.437
Can't have vaporized it all.

07:25.362 --> 07:26.943
Nothing.

07:31.577 --> 07:34.159
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

07:34.246 --> 07:36.407
(chirps and squeaks)

07:37.541 --> 07:39.247
(dripping)

08:01.690 --> 08:02.896
Oh...

08:05.361 --> 08:07.977
Oh, God... Oh my God!

08:11.116 --> 08:14.233
What's happening to me must
have to do with that cluster
we passed through.

08:14.328 --> 08:16.193
The... the... the light thing.

08:16.288 --> 08:21.123
Crichton, I've told you, all
scans indicate the cluster
was harmless.

08:21.210 --> 08:24.247
It was not harmless.
Run the scan again.

08:24.338 --> 08:29.332
Look, look, l-l... maybe I
imagined the light thing,
but I bled.

08:29.426 --> 08:32.042
And I have the blood
to prove it.

08:32.137 --> 08:33.593
And I'm not cut anywhere.

08:33.681 --> 08:36.889
There could be another
explanation for what's
happening.

08:36.975 --> 08:43.813
When Kaavork duplicated you
on the diseased Leviathan
perhaps he...

08:43.899 --> 08:47.562
You think maybe Kaavork did
something to me, that my
body is breaking down?

08:47.653 --> 08:51.271
I'm sorry, but it is possible.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.321
Jool:
What is going on?

08:53.409 --> 08:56.697
My chamber is boiling hot.
This place is leaking.

08:56.787 --> 09:00.200
Well, Pilot says he's having
some troubles with the
internals.

09:02.459 --> 09:04.950
You're tired. It could all
turn out to be nothing.

09:05.045 --> 09:08.788
Nothing? I am bleeding and
I have no wounds.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.747
So I'm either St. John of the
Uncharted Territories

09:10.843 --> 09:13.084
or there's something very,
very wrong with me.

09:13.178 --> 09:14.509
Well, what would you
like us to do?

09:14.596 --> 09:17.508
I want all of you to watch me,
in case I have another episode,

09:17.599 --> 09:19.100
a bleed, whatever you call it.

09:19.184 --> 09:21.266
I'm sorry. As much fun as that
sounds, I don't think so.

09:21.353 --> 09:23.184
Pip, stop okay?

09:23.272 --> 09:26.309
You know, look, I thought that
l was the real me and that
that other guy,

09:26.400 --> 09:28.356
the guy on Talyn, that
he's the clone.

09:28.444 --> 09:30.150
But I'm starting to think maybe
I'm the photocopy.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.273
Crichton, this has nothing
to do with the split.

09:32.364 --> 09:34.195
Just sleep. You'll be fine.

09:34.283 --> 09:37.116
No, I'm not imagining this.

09:37.202 --> 09:40.444
Watch me, please.

09:40.539 --> 09:41.494
D'Argo:
All right, John.

09:41.582 --> 09:43.948
Sit down, in fact... ah-ah-ah!

09:44.042 --> 09:45.452
Girls, we will all...

09:45.544 --> 09:48.286
(groaning)
sit down and watch John.

09:48.380 --> 09:49.586
Off we go.

09:49.673 --> 09:51.334
(sighing)

09:55.971 --> 09:57.177
What if I have to piss?

09:57.264 --> 10:01.428
Well, then, we will all
urinate together.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.133
You promise?

10:03.228 --> 10:04.764
Ugh!

10:23.874 --> 10:25.614
You having fun yet?

10:25.709 --> 10:27.324
Galaxies of it.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.337
(sighs)

10:32.424 --> 10:33.174
Can we go now?

10:33.258 --> 10:34.509
No.

10:34.593 --> 10:36.333
Sorry, but I'm not gonna
sit here...
-No!

10:36.428 --> 10:37.759
( groans )

10:39.264 --> 10:40.845
There's water everywhere.

10:40.933 --> 10:42.013
Where'd that come from?

10:42.100 --> 10:43.806
That bucket's overflowing
aheady?

10:43.894 --> 10:45.009
Oh, yeah, see?

10:45.103 --> 10:46.479
See, see, see, I saw it.
I told you.

10:46.563 --> 10:49.270
Strange things are happening.
I had this DRD record us.

10:49.358 --> 10:51.599
He's going to put it
on the clamshell.

10:53.403 --> 10:55.394
You having fun yet?

10:55.489 --> 10:57.104
Galaxies of it.

10:59.409 --> 11:01.400
Jool:
What's going on?

11:01.495 --> 11:03.281
We're not moving.

11:13.257 --> 11:14.246
Can we go now?

11:14.341 --> 11:15.581
No.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.632
Sorry, but I'm not gonna
sit here...
-No!

11:18.637 --> 11:19.843
Jool:
What happened to us?

11:19.930 --> 11:21.170
There's water everywhere.

11:21.265 --> 11:22.596
Where'd that come from?

11:28.355 --> 11:30.141
All scans indicate normal.

11:30.232 --> 11:33.895
Braca:
Right, well, let's seek
official approval, shall we?

11:33.986 --> 11:39.071
Sir, the Prowler retained
its integrity on the
last six reentries.

11:39.157 --> 11:41.773
No gravitational distortions?
-No. Nothing.

11:41.869 --> 11:46.909
Electronics, bio-mass
indicators all within
acceptable parameters.

11:46.999 --> 11:49.581
And now you want to
send a Peacekeeper?

11:49.668 --> 11:53.001
He has oscillation ratings.

11:53.088 --> 11:56.205
With respect, Scorpius,
bio-mass reentry will work.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.916
Your indecision is
wasting time.

11:59.011 --> 12:01.172
Linfer:
What he means, sir...

12:01.263 --> 12:07.179
the wormhole is degenerating,
and stabilization has been
unsuccessful so far.

12:07.269 --> 12:10.807
If we don't complete our trial
soon, it will delay us.

12:10.898 --> 12:12.854
To find another wormhole.

12:12.941 --> 12:16.308
Drillic:
So, can we please get started?

12:16.403 --> 12:19.566
You demanded my transfer here
so I could master wormholes

12:19.656 --> 12:21.271
and create the weapon
you desire.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.402
You did not transfer me here
to wait for your permission

12:23.493 --> 12:25.404
as if you were my mother.

12:25.495 --> 12:29.329
It is now time to proceed
with biological trials.

12:31.001 --> 12:32.912
Right, son.

12:33.003 --> 12:37.497
Well, deploy him.

12:40.761 --> 12:45.346
Drillic:
Clear the hangar area. Stand by
for manual Prowler launch.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.174
Best I can figure, we were out
for about half an arn.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.133
How could that be?

12:50.228 --> 12:53.391
Well, perhaps Moya lost
atmospheric pressure and we
blacked out and lost time.

12:53.482 --> 12:57.441
We are doing a lot more
than just losing time.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.267
I think, though I'm not sure...

12:59.363 --> 13:03.231
but I think I may have
lost time earlier.

13:03.325 --> 13:06.909
Before I changed into this I
was running a soak, and the
water was warm.

13:06.995 --> 13:10.112
Instantaneously, it was cold.

13:10.207 --> 13:11.743
Why didn't you tell us this?

13:11.833 --> 13:14.825
Well, I just thought it was a
heating coil malfunction.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.376
Anything strange happen
to you guys?

13:16.463 --> 13:19.830
I live on this ship.
Something strang always happens.

13:19.925 --> 13:21.256
Not like spasming.

13:21.343 --> 13:25.677
Before my first episode,
I saw some kind of light.

13:25.764 --> 13:27.971
Moya passed through an
electromagnetic cluster.

13:28.058 --> 13:30.219
Now, Pilot says it's harmless,
but it's got to be related.

13:30.310 --> 13:34.770
Pilot, have you run the
long-range re-scan on that
cluster yet?

13:39.361 --> 13:40.771
Pilot!

13:42.864 --> 13:45.526
Pilot! You okay?

13:45.617 --> 13:47.573
Jool:
Where are the lights?

13:47.661 --> 13:49.117
Pilot?
-ls he breathing?

13:49.204 --> 13:51.786
I don't know.
-Oh, hezmana, he stinks!

13:51.873 --> 13:53.283
What happened to us has
happened to Pilot, too.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.331
Does anybody know how
to check his pulse?

13:55.419 --> 13:57.034
It's behind the neck,
in between the vertebrae.

13:57.129 --> 13:58.209
Right.

13:58.296 --> 14:00.161
( distorted growl ):
Get back.

14:00.257 --> 14:02.418
Get back! Get back!

14:04.886 --> 14:06.547
(yells)

14:10.684 --> 14:13.050
( distorted voice ):
Apologies.

14:13.145 --> 14:15.727
But you must stay back.

14:15.814 --> 14:20.308
For one of you,
judgment starts now.

14:25.157 --> 14:27.193
Judgment? What the hell are
you talking about?

14:27.284 --> 14:29.275
( distorted voice ):
Pilot's gone.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.360
lam in him now.

14:31.455 --> 14:32.991
Apologies.

14:33.081 --> 14:35.072
Tried to taste without
your knowing.

14:35.167 --> 14:35.906
Jool:
Taste?

14:36.001 --> 14:37.582
But you discovered.

14:37.669 --> 14:39.170
(groaning)

14:39.254 --> 14:43.338
Back, back! Don't know how
to control this body.

14:43.425 --> 14:45.507
This ship... yet.

14:45.594 --> 14:47.801
Must slow down.

14:47.888 --> 14:50.595
This body cannot contain me.

14:50.682 --> 14:52.547
Crichton:
Then get out of it.

14:53.935 --> 14:57.723
Please, lwill not harm
your Pilot.

14:57.814 --> 15:03.775
I can stay in him a short
time to find the diseased
energy rider.

15:03.862 --> 15:07.855
My group probes could not
detect who it occupies.

15:07.949 --> 15:09.485
What's an energy rider?

15:09.576 --> 15:11.316
We live in clusters.

15:11.411 --> 15:15.199
When you passed through
ours a diseased rider
escaped on your ship.

15:15.290 --> 15:20.250
Jool:
Are you saying there's a
diseased alien in one of us?

15:20.337 --> 15:25.331
Yes. I must taste you,
alone now, to find it.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.336
What the fek are you
talking about?

15:27.427 --> 15:28.462
What is he talking about?

15:28.553 --> 15:30.885
(groaning)

15:30.972 --> 15:33.054
Shoot him. Shoot him now.
You're the warrior,
shoot him now.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.097
All right, with what? My nose?

15:35.185 --> 15:36.925
Shoot him.
-No, it's Pilot.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.226
We're not gonna shoot him.

15:38.313 --> 15:40.395
Why not?
-Fek up, Jool.

15:41.566 --> 15:46.151
First law in my world,
don't hurt the body.

15:46.238 --> 15:49.321
Rider, I am not here to
destroy you.

15:49.407 --> 15:50.863
Reveal yourself.

15:50.951 --> 15:53.408
I do not wish to hurt
these others.

15:54.204 --> 15:56.069
(groaning)

15:56.164 --> 15:58.325
Must calm this Pilot.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.702
Do not try to ambush me.

16:00.794 --> 16:03.206
I will know!

16:04.840 --> 16:06.922
Jool:
Does anyone know what's
going on here?

16:07.008 --> 16:08.589
I don't know. You feel
any different?

16:08.677 --> 16:10.133
What do you mean, "different?"

16:10.220 --> 16:12.336
Different, like I might have
a diseased alien in me,
different?

16:12.430 --> 16:14.136
No, I don't feel like that.

16:14.224 --> 16:17.136
Actually, now that you mention
it, I've been feeling
a little angry.

16:17.227 --> 16:18.967
That's normal for you.
Jool, wrong way.

16:19.062 --> 16:21.178
Why do you believe a word that
thing inside Pilot's saying?

16:21.273 --> 16:22.638
I don't have to believe it,
Chiana.

16:22.732 --> 16:24.347
But something made me bleed,

16:24.442 --> 16:26.774
and it made all of us shake
like a sheep in Arkansas.

16:26.862 --> 16:29.228
Well, I think I should just
grab my Qualta Rifle

16:29.322 --> 16:32.109
stick it in its mouth and say
"Hey, get out of Pilot."

16:32.200 --> 16:34.691
And what are you gonna do
if it says no?

16:36.913 --> 16:38.198
Run a full vessel scan.

16:38.290 --> 16:41.407
See if we have control of
anything on board.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.993
I hate to point out the
obvious, but if something
is inside us,

16:45.088 --> 16:48.296
I think it likely, since you
had the first symptoms, that
you're the infected.

16:48.383 --> 16:51.796
Kiss my butt. If I'm Linda
Blair, why am I telling you
guys anything?

16:51.887 --> 16:54.879
Well, it'd be the smart thing
to do if later you need to
appear innocent.

16:54.973 --> 16:56.338
I'm not that smart.

16:56.433 --> 16:59.345
I thought of that.

16:59.436 --> 17:00.642
I still think you're the
best candidate.

17:00.729 --> 17:02.265
Right. Opinion noted.
Leave me alone.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.515
D'Argo, what you got?

17:03.607 --> 17:05.313
Nothing. I can't get control
of anything.

17:05.400 --> 17:08.233
Me, either. That damn thing in
Pilot left us with squat.

17:08.320 --> 17:12.233
Chiana:
You know, it is possible that
we're fine, and Pilot's the only infected one.

17:12.324 --> 17:14.360
D'Argo:
Why? What could it
possibly want?

17:14.451 --> 17:16.658
I don't know, maybe he's crazy.

17:16.745 --> 17:18.281
Sounds feked to me.

17:18.371 --> 17:21.204
I think we should all get a
Transport Pod out of here, now.

17:21.291 --> 17:23.532
Weren't you listening?
We have no control.

17:23.627 --> 17:26.209
If that thing in Pilot
doesn't want you to leave,
you're not leaving.

17:26.296 --> 17:27.911
Look at the lights.
Look at the dripping water.

17:28.006 --> 17:30.793
That thing is not
controlling everything.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.427
Maybe I'll get lucky.

17:36.514 --> 17:37.549
Good luck.

17:37.641 --> 17:39.381
( hisses )

17:40.352 --> 17:42.968
Unified plan, as always.

17:47.067 --> 17:50.355
Linfer:
Auto-retrieval and
bio-fluctuations appear normal.

17:50.445 --> 17:53.152
Then why is your pilot not
responding to our comms?

17:53.240 --> 17:55.606
I suspect an antenna burnout.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.567
Vessel integrity is
definitely intact.

17:58.662 --> 17:59.868
Well, open it.

18:15.929 --> 18:20.047
Your pilot's integrity is,
well...

18:21.476 --> 18:23.842
It is definitely not intact.

18:23.937 --> 18:26.474
There must be a malfunction in
the negative shield deployment.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.179
This will never happen again.

18:28.275 --> 18:32.564
Oh, it'll happen once more.
Instructor Drillic will
pilot the next trial.

18:32.654 --> 18:37.944
Wash out the Prowler for
immediate deployment.

18:38.034 --> 18:41.026
Scorpius, I am not flying
the next trial.

18:42.580 --> 18:46.414
I am afraid that, uh...
Braca will insist.

18:46.501 --> 18:48.412
Drillic is project leader.
He is...

18:48.503 --> 18:51.336
And what is your name?

18:51.423 --> 18:53.505
Strappa, Co-Kura Strappa.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.547
Strappa.

18:57.262 --> 18:59.218
Well, Strappa,

19:00.390 --> 19:02.096
you are now project leader.

19:02.183 --> 19:05.220
And perhaps, now that you
know what to expect,

19:05.312 --> 19:08.395
you can discover exactly
what went wrong here.

19:10.025 --> 19:11.640
Yes?

19:16.072 --> 19:18.404
Scorpius, we had to run
Sebacean trials. It was time.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.982
Don't... don't send me.
Scorpius!

19:21.077 --> 19:22.533
Scorpius.

19:25.415 --> 19:28.657
Crichton:
All right, D.
We'll try it your way.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.170
Be cool.

19:33.214 --> 19:36.877
( distorted voice ):
Luxan, you cannot ambush me.

19:36.968 --> 19:38.754
I have my weapon pointed
at your face.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.302
I don't think I'm doing
too badly.

19:41.389 --> 19:45.223
Now, I would like to
see the real Pilot.

19:45.310 --> 19:48.268
I am trying to save you pain.

19:48.355 --> 19:52.974
I wish you would believe that,
but since you ask...

19:53.068 --> 19:54.979
(groaning)

19:57.405 --> 19:59.316
(normal voice ):
D'Argo! Crichton!

19:59.407 --> 20:00.567
He's not lying.

20:00.658 --> 20:03.240
There's a creature
in one of you.

20:03.328 --> 20:06.491
Please, get it out. Get it out!

20:06.581 --> 20:07.570
(groaning)

20:07.665 --> 20:09.917
(moans)

20:10.919 --> 20:12.455
( distorted voice ):
Please.

20:13.338 --> 20:15.704
Help me find the rider.

20:15.799 --> 20:19.508
The longer it remains in one of
you the more damage it will do.

20:19.594 --> 20:23.303
Why don't you jump into us like
you do Pilot, find it yourself?

20:23.390 --> 20:25.096
The Rider is a child.

20:25.183 --> 20:27.048
It can possess you.

20:27.143 --> 20:29.930
If I did, my power would
destroy you.

20:30.021 --> 20:32.182
And what did it do?
Why do you want it so bad?

20:32.273 --> 20:36.141
This Rider stays too long
and diseases minds.

20:36.236 --> 20:39.273
Gives only desire and despair.

20:39.364 --> 20:41.355
How do we know which
one of us it's in?

20:41.449 --> 20:43.360
Rider had to burrow in quickly.

20:43.451 --> 20:48.286
It will not know details of
the heart, sire, siblings.

20:48.373 --> 20:51.991
Your private world.

20:52.085 --> 20:55.373
D'Argo:
Lolan was my wife,
Jothee was my son.

20:55.463 --> 20:59.376
He slept with Chiana,
who was my fiancee.

20:59.467 --> 21:02.334
My dad's name was Jack,
my dog's name was Hubble.

21:02.429 --> 21:05.091
I lost my virginity to Karen
Shaw in the back of a four-by.

21:05.181 --> 21:06.682
How old were you?

21:06.766 --> 21:08.347
Sixteen.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.926
l was seven.

21:11.020 --> 21:14.228
Chiana, what's your
brother's name?

21:14.315 --> 21:16.021
You know what my
brother's name was.

21:16.109 --> 21:18.395
Just answer the question.

21:20.488 --> 21:22.194
Jool:
Ah, you were right.

21:22.282 --> 21:25.069
I couldn't even open a
Transport Pod to see if...

21:26.453 --> 21:27.784
What's going on?

21:27.871 --> 21:29.953
Boys are playing detective.

21:30.039 --> 21:32.530
What, that thing in Pilot
tell you to do this?

21:32.625 --> 21:35.287
You don't know the
answer, do you?

21:35.378 --> 21:37.209
Nerri.

21:37.839 --> 21:39.295
Okay, good.

21:39.382 --> 21:42.419
Good with the Nerri.
Now, question two.

21:43.386 --> 21:48.130
Did you or did you
not kill Sakis?

21:50.101 --> 21:52.137
His name was Salis.

21:52.228 --> 21:55.345
And you don't even know
it! killed him.

21:55.440 --> 21:58.807
Yeah, well, you stay there.

21:59.903 --> 22:01.894
What are you doing?

22:01.988 --> 22:06.778
That creature in Pilot says
whichever of us is infected
won't know personal details.

22:09.621 --> 22:12.909
None of you know anything
personal about me.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.240
I could make everything up,
I could lie.

22:15.335 --> 22:18.827
Well, we know how you got
frozen in the Stasis Chamber.

22:19.297 --> 22:20.286
Tell us.

22:20.381 --> 22:21.962
And the truth.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.341
I, uh...

22:26.304 --> 22:30.593
I discovered a Noatian
gem mine.

22:30.683 --> 22:33.174
The guards caught me.
They sold me to Grunchlk.

22:33.269 --> 22:34.429
End of pathetic story.

22:34.521 --> 22:37.263
And what about your cousins?
How'd they get frozen?

22:37.357 --> 22:39.439
They waited in the
village for me.

22:40.068 --> 22:42.024
They got sick and...

22:42.111 --> 22:44.067
That is not what you
told us before.

22:44.155 --> 22:46.020
I was lying before!

22:46.115 --> 22:48.697
I'm sorry, Princess.

22:48.785 --> 22:52.198
I think you just elected
yourself most likely.

22:52.288 --> 22:54.825
( distorted voice ):
Have you found the infected?

22:54.916 --> 22:56.622
Yep. Take Jool.
-Shut up, Chi.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.700
No, we haven't found
that thing yet.

22:58.795 --> 23:01.411
Apologies. Must begin now.

23:01.506 --> 23:04.122
Do you suspect this female?

23:04.217 --> 23:05.047
No, they don't!

23:05.134 --> 23:06.670
No, no, we need more time.

23:06.761 --> 23:09.423
I'll try not to take long.

23:09.514 --> 23:11.550
John, we cannot let
them take Jool.

23:11.641 --> 23:12.676
Iknow, I...

23:12.767 --> 23:15.224
Hey, just don't take
anybody yet.

23:15.311 --> 23:18.803
We don't...
-|'|| try not to hurt... much.

23:20.858 --> 23:22.644
( screaming )

23:22.735 --> 23:24.441
Stop, no!

23:28.074 --> 23:29.154
What are you doing?

23:29.242 --> 23:30.106
Stop!

23:30.201 --> 23:31.190
Let her go!

23:31.286 --> 23:32.651
Pilot! Whoever you are!

23:32.745 --> 23:34.246
Stop now!

23:40.545 --> 23:41.534
Chiana:
Did you get it?

23:41.629 --> 23:43.039
Did you get that thing
out of her?

23:43.131 --> 23:45.338
No, it is well hidden.

23:45.425 --> 23:48.258
I have not found my rider.

23:48.344 --> 23:49.379
Apologies.

23:49.470 --> 23:51.256
Chiana:
Stuff the apologies, fekik.

23:51.347 --> 23:52.382
Is it in her or not?

23:52.473 --> 23:54.338
I am not certain.

23:54.434 --> 23:58.347
It could still be in this
female or in one of you.

23:58.438 --> 24:02.226
I'm afraid I must taste
each of you in turn.

24:02.317 --> 24:06.151
This is all the rider's fault.

24:09.324 --> 24:10.655
Is she all right?

24:10.742 --> 24:12.232
She's breathing.

24:12.327 --> 24:14.238
D'Argo, come on. I got an idea.

24:14.329 --> 24:15.865
No. I'm coming with you.

24:15.955 --> 24:18.367
Uh-uh. Chiana, somebody
has to stay with Jool.

24:18.458 --> 24:21.040
No, no, no, not me.
Not this time.

24:21.127 --> 24:23.243
All right, you two go.
I'll stay here.

24:28.343 --> 24:30.174
We're gonna have
a little chat.

24:30.261 --> 24:34.004
Moya must know that there's
something seriously
wrong with Pilot.

24:34.098 --> 24:37.010
We've gotta get that thing out
of him. Does she have any idea
how we can do that?

24:37.101 --> 24:39.763
(chittering )

24:39.854 --> 24:40.889
You understand any of this?

24:40.980 --> 24:42.186
No.

24:42.273 --> 24:44.764
All right, we don't understand
the R2—D2 crap.

24:44.859 --> 24:46.815
We're going to use the
Star Trek system.

24:46.903 --> 24:49.815
One blink for yes,
two blinks for no.

24:49.906 --> 24:51.271
You understand?

24:52.241 --> 24:53.230
Good.

24:53.326 --> 24:54.281
Will you help?

24:56.371 --> 24:57.611
Chiana:
Where are we?

24:57.705 --> 25:00.287
Below the Neural Cluster.

25:00.375 --> 25:01.615
I heard Pilot once say

25:01.709 --> 25:04.667
there's a chamber down here
where he has no sense receptors.

25:04.754 --> 25:07.336
Kind of like the human brain.

25:08.549 --> 25:11.336
Pilot can't feel anything.

25:11.427 --> 25:13.839
Can't find us down here.

25:20.812 --> 25:23.178
Starburst chamber.

25:23.272 --> 25:27.481
This must be where the energy
of Starburst first coalesces.

25:27.568 --> 25:30.105
From in here, can we get
that thing out of Pilot?

25:30.196 --> 25:32.278
I don't know.

25:32.365 --> 25:33.696
(metallic clang )

25:35.034 --> 25:36.274
What the hell is that?

25:36.369 --> 25:38.200
You think it wants us
to push something?

25:38.287 --> 25:40.539
You're asking the wrong cowboy.

25:40.623 --> 25:42.329
Where'd DRD Pike go?

25:42.417 --> 25:44.248
Ah, forget about it.

25:44.335 --> 25:46.621
Hey, yo, Chiana.
Don-don't touch anything.

25:46.713 --> 25:48.294
Don't be a tralk.

25:48.381 --> 25:50.246
It wouldn't have brought us
down here for no reason.

25:50.341 --> 25:52.297
Hey Moya, you want us
to push this?

25:52.385 --> 25:54.250
Chiana, don't push
any buttons...

25:54.345 --> 25:56.552
(throbbing hum)

25:58.933 --> 26:00.514
Turn it off. Turn it off.

26:00.601 --> 26:01.386
How?!

26:01.477 --> 26:03.138
Hit the button again!

26:09.318 --> 26:11.309
(humming stops)

26:15.491 --> 26:18.324
Was that a Starburst blast?

26:18.411 --> 26:21.153
No, if it was Starburst
we'd be dead.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.033
Moya must have shut it down.

26:23.124 --> 26:25.240
Why would Moya want us
down here for this?

26:25.334 --> 26:29.043
I have no idea, unless...

26:31.883 --> 26:33.293
Unless what?

26:35.136 --> 26:37.092
Uh, um...

26:38.389 --> 26:41.927
Unless I get some more
schematics, I don't know.

26:46.564 --> 26:50.022
( distorted voice ):
You know.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.815
Know? Know what?

26:51.903 --> 26:55.737
You saw.

26:56.824 --> 26:59.611
Saw...

27:01.537 --> 27:04.404
Saw me.

27:08.085 --> 27:10.497
( distorted voice ):
Had to show...

27:10.588 --> 27:13.876
gla-glad to show...

27:13.966 --> 27:18.460
Mm-mm... So good.

27:18.554 --> 27:22.342
Feels good.

27:22.433 --> 27:24.515
Chi, what the hell
are you doing?

27:24.602 --> 27:29.266
Taste... taste...

27:30.817 --> 27:34.184
Love to try this body.

27:34.278 --> 27:36.143
Okay, whatever you are, you can
get the hell off of me.

27:36.239 --> 27:42.200
This body wants you.

27:42.286 --> 27:45.995
Fear... no fear of me.

27:46.082 --> 27:49.324
Tallip, he lies. Lies.

27:49.418 --> 27:50.999
Tallip's that thing in Pilot?

27:51.087 --> 27:54.420
Heard him say I hurt this body.

27:54.507 --> 27:56.498
Not true.

27:56.592 --> 28:01.052
Love this tight body.

28:01.138 --> 28:03.345
Oh, oh yeah, yeah, we all
love this body.

28:03.432 --> 28:05.593
Okay, you sit.

28:05.685 --> 28:08.768
We'll sip later. I'll call you.
You're in the book, right?

28:08.855 --> 28:11.312
Tallip wants to kill me.

28:11.399 --> 28:14.311
That's why I hide.

28:14.402 --> 28:17.610
I hide when your ship pass.

28:17.697 --> 28:20.234
Mistake. Only four here.

28:20.324 --> 28:23.942
Only four. Not take long
to find me.

28:24.036 --> 28:25.116
Not... not long.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.114
Tallip?

28:26.205 --> 28:29.447
Tallip likes pain.

28:29.542 --> 28:32.784
After me, he kill...

28:32.879 --> 28:34.369
you.

28:34.463 --> 28:38.297
Tallip said that if you stay
in Chiana, you're going
to kill her.

28:38.676 --> 28:41.588
Tallip lies.

28:42.388 --> 28:45.050
I not lie.

28:45.641 --> 28:47.256
Oh!

28:47.351 --> 28:50.468
Oh! Good god!

28:50.563 --> 28:52.895
Oh! Whoa! What'd you
just do to me?

28:52.982 --> 28:58.727
Sip. Sip. Inspire.

28:58.821 --> 29:01.187
Tallip is pain.

29:01.282 --> 29:03.489
Not me.

29:03.576 --> 29:05.032
(gasps )

29:07.538 --> 29:11.030
Okay, that... that...
that's good.

29:11.125 --> 29:13.207
But this doesn't prove anything.

29:13.294 --> 29:15.831
Won't hurt your friend.

29:15.922 --> 29:18.914
Just... must hide.

29:19.008 --> 29:23.968
Get me away to where
there are many.

29:24.055 --> 29:27.718
Tallip not find if
there are many.

29:27.808 --> 29:28.763
Please?

29:28.851 --> 29:31.558
Fine. I'll, uh, talk
to my friends.

29:31.646 --> 29:34.183
You... you're gonna...
you're gonna stay here.

29:34.273 --> 29:35.308
You're, you're safe here.

29:35.399 --> 29:39.267
No. How I know? Trust you?

29:40.196 --> 29:41.481
You don't.

29:41.572 --> 29:44.564
But I'm a guy. I'll probably
be back in 15 minutes.

29:44.659 --> 29:46.274
(sighs)

29:46.369 --> 29:49.031
Oh, that's unnatural.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.622
Good God!

30:00.925 --> 30:03.211
Ah... You're busy. I'll
come back later, sir.
-Braca.

30:03.302 --> 30:05.463
No, no, no. Come in. Come in.

30:10.059 --> 30:11.424
( device hisses )

30:20.069 --> 30:21.809
Braca.

30:21.904 --> 30:25.647
Why is it that Crichton,
a human, can survive
wormhole reentry,

30:25.741 --> 30:27.117
and the Sebacean cannot?

30:27.201 --> 30:29.112
Well, perhaps there's
some information

30:29.203 --> 30:32.161
still hidden in the chip we
took from Crichton's brain.

30:33.124 --> 30:34.580
Perhaps.

30:36.043 --> 30:39.126
Do you know why you're my
second in command, Braca?

30:39.213 --> 30:40.578
No, sir.

30:40.673 --> 30:43.039
Because you don't ask
questions.

30:43.134 --> 30:46.922
But have you ever asked
yourself, Braca,

30:47.013 --> 30:49.925
why do they give us
so much reign?

30:50.016 --> 30:51.756
Hmmm? Chasing Crichton?

30:51.851 --> 30:53.341
Researching wormholes?

30:53.436 --> 30:57.304
Well like you said, sir, I
don't question High Command.

30:57.398 --> 31:02.142
Would it surprise you to learn
that the Scarrans

31:02.236 --> 31:04.943
are planning a massive assault
against us, but they haven't?

31:05.031 --> 31:07.317
Because...

31:08.534 --> 31:11.367
because they fear our
hidden wormhole weapons.

31:11.454 --> 31:14.070
We have no hidden weapons.

31:14.165 --> 31:15.371
We lied.

31:15.458 --> 31:19.747
And I think the Scarrans are
beginning to suspect that.

31:19.837 --> 31:24.046
High Command reports that
they've been massing armies.

31:24.717 --> 31:27.424
My latest estimates,

31:27.511 --> 31:31.174
Scarran warriors outnumber
Peacekeeper soldiers...

31:32.266 --> 31:34.598
ten to one.

31:34.685 --> 31:37.267
But if and when they attack,

31:38.314 --> 31:40.646
we will lose, Braca.

31:40.733 --> 31:43.645
Unless we harness a
superior weapon.

31:43.736 --> 31:45.647
Yes.

31:45.738 --> 31:49.071
Wormhole technology.
Without it...

31:49.158 --> 31:53.322
the Sebacean race will be
overrun. Thousands of cycles
of history, gone.

31:56.582 --> 31:59.039
There's so little time.

32:00.294 --> 32:03.161
Sometimes I feel...

32:03.255 --> 32:05.541
it is already inevitable.

32:07.384 --> 32:08.339
( device hisses )

32:08.427 --> 32:10.383
(whirring )

32:13.182 --> 32:15.673
All right, we gotta talk.

32:15.768 --> 32:19.226
You led me in the Starburst
chamber to find that thing
in Chiana, didn't you?

32:19.313 --> 32:20.553
Yes.

32:20.648 --> 32:23.185
Does Moya want me to
reveal it to Tallip?

32:24.443 --> 32:27.276
And what if Tallip is lying?

32:27.363 --> 32:28.728
Whoa, whoa! Hey, whoa, whoa!

32:28.823 --> 32:30.814
Calm, calm down!

32:30.908 --> 32:32.944
I know you're freaking out
about Pilot,

32:33.035 --> 32:38.246
but if that thing in Chiana's
not diseased, does Moya still
want me to betray it?

32:39.667 --> 32:40.873
Okay.

32:42.378 --> 32:45.870
If it touches me again,
D'Argo, I will die!

32:45.965 --> 32:48.172
Found the energy rider.
It's in Chiana.

32:48.259 --> 32:51.001
She's hiding in the
Starburst chamber.

32:51.095 --> 32:54.633
Tell Pilot and get that
thing off Moya now!

32:54.723 --> 32:58.261
It might be a little more
complicated than that.

33:00.980 --> 33:03.062
( distorted voice ):
I sense your anger.

33:03.149 --> 33:06.687
I did warn you.
Tasting would be painful.

33:06.777 --> 33:09.564
We've hidden the rider,
and you'll never find it.

33:09.655 --> 33:11.191
Crichton:
So let's make a deal.

33:11.282 --> 33:13.523
you turn the ship around,
head back to your cluster,

33:13.617 --> 33:15.232
we'll tell you where
the rider is

33:15.327 --> 33:18.239
and you two can play "Pick the
friendly alien in your
neighborhood."

33:18.330 --> 33:21.493
How do I know one of you
is not infected?

33:21.584 --> 33:25.452
That this is not
the rider's plan?

33:25.546 --> 33:26.786
It's not, believe me.

33:26.881 --> 33:29.964
This plan is so bad,
it has to be ours.

33:30.050 --> 33:33.383
Okay. I choose.

33:34.805 --> 33:37.296
(yelling)

33:45.357 --> 33:48.565
( distorted voice ):
I not... not leaving.

33:48.652 --> 33:50.233
No.

33:51.280 --> 33:52.486
No.

33:57.578 --> 34:00.365
Crichton thought you
were safe here.

34:01.415 --> 34:02.951
But he was wrong.

34:03.042 --> 34:04.532
(normal voice ):
What's going on?

34:04.627 --> 34:07.164
"What's going on?" Get up!

34:07.254 --> 34:09.210
Why the pulse pistol, Princess?

34:09.298 --> 34:12.586
Crichton told us you're the one.

34:13.302 --> 34:14.212
Now get up!

34:14.303 --> 34:15.588
Okay, I'm the one.

34:15.679 --> 34:17.180
I'm the one.
-Get up!

34:17.264 --> 34:18.640
Get up!

34:20.351 --> 34:21.557
Move!

34:21.644 --> 34:24.386
( distorted voice ):
Okay, okay, y-you right.

34:24.480 --> 34:26.641
No Chi. Puff!

34:26.732 --> 34:29.474
They can't fool Jool.
Too, too smart.

34:29.568 --> 34:33.060
Your human must say
I'm not bad.

34:33.155 --> 34:34.144
Not, not bad.

34:34.240 --> 34:36.231
Jool, what are you doing?

34:36.325 --> 34:38.111
I'm taking her to Pilot.

34:38.202 --> 34:40.238
Look, that demon's got D'Argo...

34:40.329 --> 34:41.694
Out of my way!
-Hey, hey!

34:42.998 --> 34:44.534
Hey, hey, there's no need to...

34:45.542 --> 34:48.284
No more talk!

34:48.379 --> 34:49.209
Let me go.

34:49.296 --> 34:52.288
Tiny brains...

34:52.383 --> 34:53.873
no more talk.

34:53.968 --> 34:57.256
Let me go, please.
-They last forever.

34:57.346 --> 34:59.837
Pretty please?
-I give them...

34:59.932 --> 35:01.388
Please let go.

35:03.227 --> 35:06.139
Okay, so everything Tallip
said about you is true.

35:06.230 --> 35:10.189
Chaos. Mmm...

35:10.276 --> 35:12.938
Desire.

35:13.570 --> 35:16.983
They stay.

35:17.074 --> 35:18.314
Hey, cupcake.

35:18.409 --> 35:20.946
Have you noticed the lights?
They're not pulsing anymore.

35:21.036 --> 35:23.322
Your friend must be done
with D'Argo.

35:28.752 --> 35:31.539
Tallip, take the rider but
don't hurt Chiana.

35:33.966 --> 35:35.922
(choking gasps)

35:38.304 --> 35:39.464
Tallip?!

35:41.390 --> 35:43.847
( screaming )

35:43.934 --> 35:45.470
Tallip, you're killing her!

35:47.813 --> 35:48.973
Tallip!

35:49.898 --> 35:51.604
(groaning)

36:09.877 --> 36:11.287
Crichton, she's alive.

36:11.378 --> 36:13.585
The thing's out of her.
She's alive.

36:13.672 --> 36:16.209
Is that it? You finished?

36:16.300 --> 36:20.134
( distorted voice ):
Yes. I have killed the rider.

36:20.220 --> 36:22.802
That's what it said you
wanted to do.

36:22.890 --> 36:26.724
Turn Moya around, head back
to your cluster and leave
us the hell alone.

36:26.810 --> 36:28.766
No, human.

36:28.854 --> 36:30.685
I love this now.

36:30.773 --> 36:34.140
I have mastered this body
and your ship.

36:34.234 --> 36:39.479
And now I'm going to stay.

36:44.620 --> 36:46.906
I thought you couldn't
stay in Pilot.

36:46.997 --> 36:49.204
I never knew it could
be like this.

36:49.291 --> 36:52.249
So good. The rider was right.

36:52.336 --> 36:55.203
It is perfect to stay too long.

36:55.297 --> 36:56.878
Perfect...

36:56.965 --> 36:58.216
Moya will never accept you.

36:58.300 --> 37:01.633
Moya will do what I command.
Now go.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.553
Take the Luxan with you.

37:04.640 --> 37:09.134
So I can enjoy this.

37:09.228 --> 37:12.220
( blissful moans)

37:25.786 --> 37:27.993
Thought I might find you here.

37:29.248 --> 37:30.909
Moya, you were right.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.785
I should have given the rider,
to Pilot when you said

37:32.876 --> 37:36.164
but I still think he would have
screwed us. Don't you?

37:36.255 --> 37:38.246
Okay. I got a new plan.

37:38.340 --> 37:41.628
It's a better plan,
but I need your help.

37:41.718 --> 37:43.128
Okay?

37:46.265 --> 37:48.005
Is she okay?
-Yeah.

37:48.100 --> 37:50.216
All right, I need you to go to
the Neural Cluster, Tier Seven.

37:50.310 --> 37:51.641
D'Argo's waiting there for you.

37:51.728 --> 37:53.389
What's happening?
-Just go!

37:53.480 --> 37:54.981
And the less said the better.

37:55.065 --> 37:57.021
D'Argo'll tell you
what to do.

37:57.109 --> 37:59.225
Pip, I need your help.
Can you walk?

37:59.319 --> 38:00.104
No.

38:00.195 --> 38:02.356
No? Oh, God!

38:06.785 --> 38:08.195
(gasps )

38:24.428 --> 38:28.262
Moya is going to try and
redirect some Starburst
energy into the Den.

38:28.348 --> 38:29.474
Won't that kill Pilot?

38:29.558 --> 38:30.968
Not if we time it right.

38:31.059 --> 38:34.347
We get the demon out, we kill
it, and Pilot lives.

38:34.438 --> 38:35.393
So that the only plan we got?

38:35.481 --> 38:36.516
That's it.

38:36.607 --> 38:38.313
Okay, what do you
want me to do?

38:38.400 --> 38:39.810
All right.

38:39.902 --> 38:41.733
D'Argo and Jool are going
to spook the thing.

38:41.820 --> 38:44.152
I'm going to press an override
panel in Pilot's Den.

38:44.239 --> 38:45.570
I'm gonna comm you.

38:45.657 --> 38:47.648
You join these two
circuits together.

38:47.743 --> 38:50.075
DRD Pike's gonna do
the same over there.

38:50.162 --> 38:51.902
You remember what happened
here last time, don't ya?

38:51.997 --> 38:53.203
I'm not talking about
the sex thing.

38:53.290 --> 38:55.076
That was great, but I'm
not talking about it.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.370
Starburst blast.

38:57.461 --> 39:00.203
Right. Well, this one's gonna
be a gazillion times
stronger, Chiana.

39:00.297 --> 39:03.004
So you got ten microts to get
your ass out of here.

39:03.091 --> 39:04.342
Plenty of time.

39:04.426 --> 39:06.758
Chiana? Do you understand
what you have to do?

39:06.845 --> 39:08.176
Yeah. Easy.

39:08.263 --> 39:09.298
You comm.
-Yes.

39:09.389 --> 39:10.378
s13;

39:10.474 --> 39:12.055
Leave.
-Very good.

39:12.142 --> 39:14.349
Plenty of time.

39:14.436 --> 39:16.643
DRD Pike! Keep an eye on her.

39:35.290 --> 39:37.497
I'm awake. I'm awake.

39:46.843 --> 39:48.424
(growling)

39:49.137 --> 39:51.219
What are you doing here?

39:51.306 --> 39:54.264
Oh relax, Casper. I'm not here
to interrupt your blissing.

39:54.351 --> 39:56.683
Too much makes you go blind
though, you know.

39:56.770 --> 39:59.477
What do you want, human?

39:59.565 --> 40:01.977
I want you to take us to
the shipping lanes.

40:02.067 --> 40:03.477
Then we can all get
off this boat

40:03.569 --> 40:07.187
and you can continue what
you're doing uninterrupted.

40:07.281 --> 40:08.270
Okay?

40:15.664 --> 40:16.779
( comms beep )

40:18.625 --> 40:19.740
( comms beep )

40:24.464 --> 40:26.591
( screaming )

40:26.675 --> 40:28.211
What's the matter?

40:28.302 --> 40:29.587
Stay away.

40:29.678 --> 40:33.887
It's your Pilot.
I think this body is...

40:33.974 --> 40:36.340
Monitor his internal
circulation rate.

40:36.435 --> 40:37.925
Circulation rate.

40:38.020 --> 40:41.057
I... I can't find the
circulation rate.

40:41.148 --> 40:42.763
What?

40:42.858 --> 40:44.689
Oh, perfect.
-What?

40:44.776 --> 40:48.143
No circulation rate means
he's dying, numbnuts.

40:48.238 --> 40:49.318
You're killing Pilot.

40:49.406 --> 40:51.021
I couldn't be!

40:51.116 --> 40:54.028
I gauged that this body
could sustain me.

40:54.119 --> 40:56.110
You must have gauged wrong.

40:56.204 --> 40:57.580
Stay back.

40:57.664 --> 41:00.781
I'm staying back. I'm staying
way back and watching you die.

41:03.211 --> 41:05.918
I'll vent every chamber
on this ship.

41:06.006 --> 41:08.873
Whoa, there's no reason to
be vindictive.

41:08.967 --> 41:11.754
We can figure something
else out.

41:11.845 --> 41:13.881
Moya. Moya's a living ship.

41:13.972 --> 41:14.802
Yes.

41:14.890 --> 41:17.131
Well if she's alive, then...

41:17.225 --> 41:20.092
It will have neural capacity.

41:20.187 --> 41:24.180
More than enough to hold me till
we can get back to my cluster.

41:24.274 --> 41:25.104
There you go.

41:25.192 --> 41:27.808
Yes. I will go into Moya.

41:27.903 --> 41:29.939
( screaming )

41:32.324 --> 41:34.440
Now, Chiana!

41:34.534 --> 41:36.741
Chiana! Now!

41:38.830 --> 41:42.448
Crichton:
Chiana, it's leaving Pilot.
Do it.

41:42.542 --> 41:44.078
Chiana!

41:45.128 --> 41:47.414
If it gets into Moya,
we're screwed.

41:47.881 --> 41:49.121
What?
-Chiana!

41:49.216 --> 41:51.172
Right, I'm up.
-Hey, Pip!

41:51.259 --> 41:53.090
Okay. I'm ah, okay.
-Get on it!

41:53.178 --> 41:55.294
Okay, here we go.

41:55.389 --> 41:56.754
Here we go.

42:02.396 --> 42:03.761
I've done it.

42:03.855 --> 42:06.232
Great, Chi. Now get out of
the Starburst chamber.

42:10.278 --> 42:11.563
Now, Moya!

42:22.207 --> 42:23.196
Now!

42:45.272 --> 42:46.933
Pilot, put the claws away.

42:47.023 --> 42:50.106
We can function without Moya
being perfect for a while.

42:50.193 --> 42:51.444
I can't stop.

42:51.528 --> 42:55.146
There are hundreds of little
things not working right in her.

42:55.240 --> 42:57.231
I feel like I had a
spiritual enema.

42:57.325 --> 42:59.281
Well, take a break, dude.

42:59.369 --> 43:02.361
Unless anybody wants to go
look for the Three Stooges
broadcast again.

43:02.456 --> 43:03.821
(hissing)

43:03.915 --> 43:06.167
That's a no. Take the rest.

43:06.585 --> 43:08.166
Hey, Doc.

43:08.253 --> 43:10.369
How come I bled and
you guys didn't?

43:10.464 --> 43:12.079
Well, that's obvious.

43:12.174 --> 43:16.087
You bled because you're an
irritating and inferior species.

43:16.470 --> 43:18.301
Goodnight.

43:18.388 --> 43:20.299
Goodnight.

43:20.390 --> 43:24.133
Chiana, you had that thing in
you longer than any of
the rest of us.

43:24.227 --> 43:25.433
You feel any different?

43:25.520 --> 43:29.854
No. Ijust feel like fek.

43:29.941 --> 43:33.274
D'Argo, you still
in the Cluster?

43:33.361 --> 43:35.898
No, he's not down there.
He's here.

43:35.989 --> 43:38.731
No, he's down in the Cluster.

43:39.785 --> 43:41.275
How did you know that?

43:41.369 --> 43:42.745
What?

43:42.829 --> 43:44.569
How did she know what?

43:44.664 --> 43:46.495
No, don't... don't tell me.

43:46.583 --> 43:48.824
I don't really wanna know....
I just wanna...

43:48.919 --> 43:51.001
I'm gonna get some sleep.

44:10.315 --> 44:11.896
Hello, John.

44:19.991 --> 44:24.576
Now, you tell me everything
you know about wormholes.

44:26.289 --> 44:28.245
Look.
-Everything.

44:30.544 --> 44:31.659
I found it.

44:33.296 --> 44:35.412
You found nothing, Scorpy.

44:35.507 --> 44:38.169
You missed it.
You missed the whole thing.

44:38.260 --> 44:40.125
Game over.
