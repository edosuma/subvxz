00:00.467 --> 00:02.667
<i>In New York City's war on crime</i>

00:02.668 --> 00:04.818
<i>the worst criminal
offenders are pursued</i>

00:04.819 --> 00:07.586
<i>by the detectives of
the major case squad.</i>

00:07.587 --> 00:09.772
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:13.381 --> 00:15.015
- I'm little out of my element.

00:15.016 --> 00:18.185
Is your girlfriend... classic

00:18.186 --> 00:20.120
or a little more kinky?

00:20.121 --> 00:22.556
- She's both.
- Well, which one do you like?

00:22.557 --> 00:25.292
I like the red one.

00:25.293 --> 00:29.162
- The faster it comes off,
the more she'll love it.

00:37.071 --> 00:39.105
- No, man, you first.

00:41.642 --> 00:44.044
- War's blood and guts.

00:44.045 --> 00:46.246
Kill more of them than
they kill you, you win.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.081
That's why here at
Ascalon Security

00:48.082 --> 00:51.251
we teach hostage
rescue, human intel,

00:51.252 --> 00:53.053
wet work... the whole nine.

00:53.054 --> 00:54.388
- Terrence...

00:54.389 --> 00:56.657
This is a wonderful facility.

00:56.658 --> 01:00.394
But we are now more concerned
with Internet security issues.

01:00.395 --> 01:03.897
- That's why we started on a
cyber warfare division, buddy.

01:03.898 --> 01:07.401
- Iran, Egypt, Tunisia, Libya...

01:07.402 --> 01:09.970
Thousands of demonstrators
pulled to the streets

01:09.971 --> 01:12.172
from Facebook and Twitter.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.640
We have our own radicals.

01:13.641 --> 01:15.976
- Senor mendoza, I've
trained armed forces

01:15.977 --> 01:18.078
in half a dozen Latin
American countries.

01:18.079 --> 01:20.914
I'll give you computers
are important...

01:20.915 --> 01:22.683
But computers don't kill people.

01:22.684 --> 01:25.419
People kill people.

01:25.420 --> 01:27.354
- The war of tomorrow
is being fought today.

01:27.355 --> 01:28.789
The stuxnet computer virus

01:28.790 --> 01:32.059
sets back Iran's nuclear
enrichment programs five years,

01:32.060 --> 01:34.561
direct proof that war
as we know it is over.

01:34.562 --> 01:37.497
Sun tech's programming teams
create offensive strategies

01:37.498 --> 01:40.934
such as data deletion and the
targeted spread of viruses.

01:40.935 --> 01:44.838
As well as measures to ensure
our own infrastructure.

01:44.839 --> 01:47.174
In the future, a
computer-wielding David

01:47.175 --> 01:50.277
will be able to strike down
a nuclear-armed goliath.

01:50.278 --> 01:53.080
So you folks from
defense, NSA, CIA,

01:53.081 --> 01:54.748
you can all use sun
tech to help you guard

01:54.749 --> 01:57.083
America's cyber security.

02:00.688 --> 02:02.089
- You sure you don't
want to come in?

02:02.090 --> 02:03.724
It's raining.

02:03.725 --> 02:06.359
- No, we're fine. Thanks.

02:08.929 --> 02:11.198
- Send the malware protection
contract for Stewart to vet,

02:11.199 --> 02:13.133
and set up a 4:00 p.
M. With Harvey

02:13.134 --> 02:14.301
in case he cancels again.

02:14.302 --> 02:17.104
- I'm warning you.
Stay away from mendoza.

02:17.105 --> 02:18.872
- The man needs computers,

02:18.873 --> 02:20.807
not the G.I. Joe
crap you're selling.

02:20.808 --> 02:23.043
Big fish eat
little fish, Naomi.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.448
- Hey, I'm up here.
Where are you?

03:17.698 --> 03:18.631
Crash!

03:20.167 --> 03:22.802
What was that? Oh, my God!

03:36.003 --> 03:41.903
<b>Sub by Adriano_CSI
www.addic7ed.com</b>

04:20.209 --> 04:21.709
He landed on the cab.

04:21.709 --> 04:23.110
Presumably falling
from this building.

04:23.111 --> 04:24.312
All he had was some cash

04:24.313 --> 04:26.980
and an I.D. Badge
from Ascalon Security.

04:27.481 --> 04:29.348
Ascalon?

04:29.349 --> 04:30.616
You've heard of Ascalon.

04:30.617 --> 04:32.902
Send out mercenaries
all over the world.

04:32.937 --> 04:35.188
Got into trouble for
civilian casualties.

04:35.189 --> 04:36.656
- Yeah.
That's why we called you guys.

04:36.657 --> 04:38.891
The name on the I.D.
Is Ian masefield.

04:38.892 --> 04:41.727
- Thanks.
- It's a kanji tattoo.

04:43.697 --> 04:46.132
I remember them from when
I was stationed in Korea

04:46.133 --> 04:47.834
back in the '90s.

04:47.835 --> 04:49.535
- Jumper?

04:49.536 --> 04:53.105
- See the fresh bruising
on the back of his hand?

04:56.576 --> 04:58.210
- That's a high fall.

05:00.547 --> 05:03.116
Partial shoeprints. Two sets.

05:03.117 --> 05:05.184
Looks like there was a struggle.

05:05.185 --> 05:07.720
Can you plaster these, please?

05:07.721 --> 05:10.289
- The...Lingerie.

05:10.290 --> 05:12.158
- Box is crushed.

05:12.159 --> 05:14.193
- Looks like it was part
of the same struggle.

05:14.194 --> 05:15.728
- The railing didn't
do much good.

05:15.729 --> 05:16.863
- Yeah...

05:16.864 --> 05:18.397
White powder.

05:18.398 --> 05:19.965
Dirt.

05:23.770 --> 05:25.337
Dirt.

05:31.711 --> 05:32.878
Dirt.

05:48.028 --> 05:49.162
Climbing chalk.

05:49.163 --> 05:53.166
Used for parkour.
- Urban climbing.

05:53.167 --> 05:56.736
- Somebody scaled onto
this deck from below.

05:56.737 --> 05:58.838
- See the shape of the bruising?

05:58.839 --> 06:00.840
Crushed knuckles,
broken fingers.

06:00.841 --> 06:03.009
- Somebody stomped his hands

06:03.010 --> 06:04.677
while he was hanging
onto the roof.

06:04.678 --> 06:07.446
- Partial shoeprint.
Lab matched the tread.

06:07.447 --> 06:09.182
They're parkour climbing shoes.

06:09.183 --> 06:11.517
Fivefinger kos, size 9.

06:11.518 --> 06:13.853
- You're victim's
feet were size 12.

06:13.854 --> 06:15.588
Weighed in at 180.

06:15.589 --> 06:19.091
- The killer was a lot
smaller than the victim.

06:19.092 --> 06:20.927
- The realty company's faxing us

06:20.928 --> 06:23.362
all apartment owners
with access to the roof.

06:23.363 --> 06:25.731
The negligee's by coquin...

06:25.732 --> 06:27.733
We're waiting on their
retail outlets.

06:27.734 --> 06:29.936
- The negligee.

06:29.937 --> 06:32.538
Any chance this was
a lover's quarrel?

06:32.539 --> 06:35.975
- Climbing chalk on
the adjacent wall?

06:35.976 --> 06:38.578
The killing was premeditated.

06:38.579 --> 06:41.147
- Chalk on a wall.
That's pretty thin evidence.

06:41.148 --> 06:42.782
- The victim, Ian masefield,

06:42.783 --> 06:45.184
had an I.D.
Badge from ascalon securities'

06:45.185 --> 06:46.586
cyber warfare division.

06:46.587 --> 06:48.821
- Ascalon Security
has gotten over

06:48.822 --> 06:51.123
a billion in government contracts
in the last two years.

06:51.124 --> 06:53.559
- Yeah, right.
My nephew worked for them in kabul.

06:53.560 --> 06:54.994
Real Alpha dogs.

06:54.995 --> 06:56.796
- As usual, it's all
about the money.

06:56.797 --> 06:58.231
The war on terror

06:58.232 --> 07:00.600
turned into the war for
big fat contracts.

07:00.601 --> 07:03.436
- If cyber warfare is
the next cash cow,

07:03.437 --> 07:07.139
then Ian was an asset.

07:09.342 --> 07:10.776
- Sorry.

07:10.777 --> 07:12.445
I'm good with faces, bad
with names, you know?

07:12.446 --> 07:15.248
- Our lucky day.

07:15.249 --> 07:16.249
- Oh.

07:16.250 --> 07:17.350
Okay.

07:17.351 --> 07:19.685
Ian masefield.
I do recognize him.

07:19.686 --> 07:22.521
Gee. Sorry he died.

07:22.522 --> 07:24.223
He just joined our cyber
warfare division.

07:24.224 --> 07:25.491
- Cyber warfare?

07:25.492 --> 07:27.360
That's a big leap from
boots on the ground.

07:27.361 --> 07:29.829
- Yeah. In this business,
you either grow or die.

07:29.830 --> 07:31.597
It's obvious that
computers are a component

07:31.598 --> 07:33.366
to modern warfare.

07:33.367 --> 07:35.768
- Ian must not have
been a big player,

07:35.769 --> 07:37.970
otherwise you'd know his name.

07:37.971 --> 07:40.273
- So why would someone
want to kill him?

07:40.274 --> 07:42.842
- I have no idea.
- Who'd he work for last?

07:42.843 --> 07:44.744
- I have employees and
independent contractors

07:44.745 --> 07:46.178
all over the world.

07:46.179 --> 07:48.881
You'd have to ask the human
resources department that.

07:48.882 --> 07:51.284
- We'll need Ian's
home address, please.

07:54.988 --> 07:56.355
- Ma'am, we're detectives

07:56.356 --> 07:58.858
with the New York City
major case squad.

07:58.859 --> 08:01.160
Does Ian masefield live here?

08:02.762 --> 08:05.164
- Oh, no. He doesn't.

08:05.165 --> 08:07.533
- This is the address
he gave his employer.

08:07.534 --> 08:09.001
- He's a friend of my son's.

08:09.002 --> 08:11.003
He uses my house as
a mailing address.

08:11.004 --> 08:13.539
What's this about, anyway?

08:13.540 --> 08:17.877
- We're sorry to say that Ian
was murdered last night.

08:17.878 --> 08:19.946
- Oh, God, that's terrible.

08:19.947 --> 08:23.282
Please come in.

08:23.283 --> 08:24.951
I only met him three
or four times

08:24.952 --> 08:26.519
when he was picking up his mail.

08:26.520 --> 08:30.189
I think he was from Milwaukee.
Not really sure.

08:30.190 --> 08:32.291
- Why use your home
as a mailing address?

08:32.292 --> 08:35.227
- Ian traveled all the time.
Something with computers.

08:35.227 --> 08:37.296
I don't really
understand computers.

08:37.297 --> 08:39.065
- How did your son know him?

08:39.066 --> 08:40.633
Did they meet at school?

08:40.634 --> 08:43.135
- Matt makes
a lot of friends.

08:43.135 --> 08:46.839
- You, uh...
Home-schooled your son?

08:46.840 --> 08:49.241
- Yes, I did.
- Yeah, I just see

08:49.242 --> 08:53.045
you have all the materials
that the state requires.

08:53.046 --> 08:56.816
But hegel and Marcus aurelius?

08:56.817 --> 08:59.352
Schopenhauer?
It's hardly required.

08:59.353 --> 09:01.153
- Matt got through the
high school curriculum

09:01.154 --> 09:02.555
by age 12.

09:02.556 --> 09:06.125
We still debate immanuel
kant over breakfast.

09:06.126 --> 09:08.594
- Where is he right now?

09:08.595 --> 09:10.329
- Never know where that boy is.

09:10.330 --> 09:13.866
Last email said he was trekking
the inca trail in Peru.

09:15.335 --> 09:18.137
- Well, lookthanks.

09:18.138 --> 09:19.605
We're sorry about his friend.

09:24.444 --> 09:26.312
- Let's run Matt Clark,

09:26.313 --> 09:28.881
see if he can tell
us about his buddy.

09:32.452 --> 09:34.820
- Pretty sophisticated.

09:36.389 --> 09:39.324
- Matt is a black hat hacker?

09:53.873 --> 09:56.175
- There's nothing here.

09:56.176 --> 09:59.278
No address book.
No connection to Ian.

09:59.279 --> 10:01.781
- Connection?

10:01.782 --> 10:04.416
How about a really
close connection?

10:05.919 --> 10:08.687
Matt Clark <i>is</i> Ian.

10:08.688 --> 10:11.857
- So we just told elise
Clark her son was dead?

10:11.858 --> 10:13.826
- And she didn't even flinch.

10:16.262 --> 10:19.065
- I rented this place to
elise for the last 12 years.

10:19.066 --> 10:21.333
- Cash? Month-to-month?

10:21.334 --> 10:23.569
- Yeah. How'd you know?

10:23.570 --> 10:27.073
Elise! You home?

10:27.074 --> 10:28.807
Elise?

10:31.177 --> 10:33.278
- Closet's empty.

10:36.316 --> 10:37.516
- She's gone.

10:37.517 --> 10:40.619
- Wonder what she's
running from.

10:41.904 --> 10:46.839
So, Matt Clark was working at
Ascalon Security as Ian Masasefield.

10:46.840 --> 10:48.407
The question is why?

10:48.408 --> 10:50.910
After we told Matt's
mother that he'd died,

10:50.911 --> 10:52.511
she disappeared.

10:52.512 --> 10:55.181
Elise Clark has a
social security number,

10:55.182 --> 10:56.916
driver's license.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.284
Lived in new Jersey
for 12 years.

10:58.285 --> 11:00.186
No police record.
So why is she in the wind?

11:00.187 --> 11:02.188
She must have known
what he was up to.

11:02.189 --> 11:04.457
He had hacking equipment
in his apartment.

11:04.458 --> 11:07.026
- Okay. But what was he doing
on the roof that night?

11:07.027 --> 11:09.362
- Realty company sent over
a list of apartment owners

11:09.363 --> 11:10.730
in the building.

11:10.731 --> 11:12.798
One's owned by sun
tech industries.

11:12.799 --> 11:14.433
- Sun tech is a company

11:14.434 --> 11:16.402
that specializes
in cyber warfare.

11:16.403 --> 11:18.571
- We checked Matt
Clark's tax records.

11:18.572 --> 11:21.340
Until a month ago, guess
who his boss was.

11:25.045 --> 11:27.213
- Matt Clark.

11:27.214 --> 11:29.215
Yes, he worked for me.

11:29.216 --> 11:32.218
That's horrible.

11:32.219 --> 11:34.620
- The property manager says

11:34.621 --> 11:37.556
Matt had access to your
corporate penthouse.

11:37.557 --> 11:40.660
- From which he
fell to his death.

11:40.661 --> 11:42.695
- Yes, Matt sometimes met
with out-of-town clients

11:42.696 --> 11:43.930
at the corporate apartment.

11:43.931 --> 11:45.564
- She was pretty high level.

11:45.565 --> 11:48.167
- It seems like in today's world

11:48.168 --> 11:51.737
Matt would be the
Robert Oppenheimer

11:51.738 --> 11:54.240
of the computer age, you know?

11:54.241 --> 11:58.611
Inventing an h-bomb
virus on his laptop.

11:58.612 --> 12:02.148
Y- you must have been
angry to lose him.

12:02.149 --> 12:03.616
- These things happen.

12:03.617 --> 12:05.518
He had a dozen other
companies chasing him too.

12:05.519 --> 12:10.122
- I-is this an exceptional
service medallion?

12:11.825 --> 12:14.193
- It's my late husband.
He was killed in Afghanistan.

12:14.194 --> 12:16.729
- Sorry.

12:16.730 --> 12:18.264
- Seems odd...

12:18.265 --> 12:21.801
Matt would be on the roof
of your snazzy apartment

12:21.802 --> 12:25.404
while he was working
for ascalon.

12:25.405 --> 12:28.641
We found a slinky little
nighty up there too.

12:28.642 --> 12:30.042
- You're kidding, right?

12:30.043 --> 12:32.878
I'm dating a hedge fund manager.

12:32.879 --> 12:34.914
- That's not what we
were implying at all.

12:34.915 --> 12:39.118
We're just saying if you were
to plant him at ascalon,

12:39.119 --> 12:41.687
then you'd have like a
double agent thing going

12:41.688 --> 12:45.257
and...Well, then, you'd have a
mole in your rival's company.

12:45.258 --> 12:46.826
- He steals data.

12:46.827 --> 12:49.962
Gives you info on pending
government contracts.

12:53.333 --> 12:55.834
- Yes.
He was still working for me.

12:57.237 --> 12:58.771
- Matthew Clark.

12:58.772 --> 13:00.539
Nope.
I don't recognize the name.

13:00.540 --> 13:03.342
- Ring any bells?

13:03.343 --> 13:07.613
- Ian masefield. Okay.
That's a surprise.

13:07.614 --> 13:09.448
- You know he worked
for sun tech?

13:09.449 --> 13:12.752
- Give Naomi credit.

13:12.753 --> 13:14.186
She knew I started
a cyber division.

13:14.187 --> 13:15.821
She planted him as a mole.

13:16.823 --> 13:19.024
- Sun tzu.

13:20.560 --> 13:23.029
"All warfare is deception."

13:23.030 --> 13:25.831
- All right.
She punked me, okay?

13:25.832 --> 13:28.267
But I didn't kill Ian... or Matt

13:28.268 --> 13:30.136
or whatever his real name is.

13:30.137 --> 13:32.471
I was in mezzo that night
with ten other people.

13:32.472 --> 13:34.373
- But he stole from you.

13:34.374 --> 13:37.143
I mean, there are potentially
billions of dollars at stake.

13:37.144 --> 13:39.011
- Yeah.
I'll be looking into that

13:39.012 --> 13:40.980
the minute you guys leave.

13:40.981 --> 13:43.215
- Consider us gone.

13:44.851 --> 13:47.553
- This is the information Matt
hacked from ascalon's files.

13:47.554 --> 13:49.755
- How many pages of documents
on these hard drives?

13:49.756 --> 13:51.157
- Over 50,000.

13:51.158 --> 13:54.226
The cops'll definitely
subpoena this stuff.

13:54.227 --> 13:55.761
- Good.

14:00.867 --> 14:04.870
- We're coquin's only u.
S. Retail store.

14:04.871 --> 14:07.773
- Remember him?
- Oh, for sure.

14:07.774 --> 14:10.176
He was pretty tall, kinda cute.

14:10.177 --> 14:12.945
He had two friends with him,
big guys, kinda awkward.

14:12.946 --> 14:15.147
They were standing
next to the door.

14:15.148 --> 14:17.083
- What did he buy?
- A negligee.

14:17.084 --> 14:19.452
- Which one?
- Uh...This one.

14:19.453 --> 14:23.556
He had a hard time deciding
between this and classic black.

14:23.557 --> 14:25.024
Then he called
like an hour later

14:25.025 --> 14:27.860
and ordered the black one too,
and that one we delivered.

14:29.996 --> 14:32.998
- I love this place.

14:35.969 --> 14:37.269
- I'm totally
devastated by this.

14:37.270 --> 14:39.138
We were good friends.

14:39.139 --> 14:41.674
- Friends with benefits?

14:41.675 --> 14:43.976
- What's that got to
do with anything?

14:43.977 --> 14:46.345
- Did you know that he worked
for a private security firm

14:46.346 --> 14:48.280
under the name Ian masefield?

14:48.281 --> 14:50.583
- He worked at sun tech.

14:50.584 --> 14:52.685
- What do you do, Rebecca?

14:52.686 --> 14:54.420
- I teach a krav maga
class at crunch.

14:54.421 --> 14:56.288
- Israeli self-defense.

14:56.289 --> 14:57.957
- You're a sabra.

14:57.958 --> 14:59.658
And you like computers
too, just like Matt.

14:59.659 --> 15:01.660
- Oh, that's just a hobby.

15:01.661 --> 15:04.430
- Diplomatic cables between
Egypt and Washington.

15:04.431 --> 15:06.765
That's a fun hobby.

15:06.766 --> 15:08.968
- These are just
something I downloaded.

15:08.969 --> 15:10.536
Look, I have to
go teach a class.

15:10.537 --> 15:13.439
- Oh.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.841
Okay.
Well, thanks for your time.

15:15.842 --> 15:17.309
- You're welcome.

15:20.013 --> 15:23.182
- You better cancel krav maga.

15:23.183 --> 15:25.284
You have confidential
cables and documents

15:25.285 --> 15:26.685
all over your apartment.

15:26.686 --> 15:28.954
Once the judge
signs our warrant,

15:28.955 --> 15:31.023
we'll search your
place top to bottom.

15:31.024 --> 15:32.825
Now's your chance
to get ahead of it.

15:32.826 --> 15:36.462
Have a seat.
- Thanks, man.

15:36.463 --> 15:38.397
- What's on your wrist?

15:38.398 --> 15:40.232
- A tattoo.

15:40.233 --> 15:43.202
- Your place is filled
with hacking gear.

15:43.203 --> 15:44.570
- The gear's legal.

15:44.571 --> 15:46.372
- Same stuff that Matt had.

15:46.373 --> 15:49.175
And same tattoo.

15:49.176 --> 15:51.810
Was your affiliation with him...

15:51.811 --> 15:55.548
Did that go beyond
friends with benefits?

15:55.549 --> 15:58.717
- No. It didn't.

15:58.718 --> 16:01.153
- You were in the Israeli army.

16:01.154 --> 16:02.454
Gadsar.

16:02.455 --> 16:04.023
That's an elite unit.

16:04.024 --> 16:06.458
It's tougher than the
rangers, spetsnaz.

16:06.459 --> 16:09.562
You studied krav
maga, urban combat.

16:09.563 --> 16:11.697
Wow.

16:14.467 --> 16:18.671
I bet you really could
scale a city wall.

16:18.672 --> 16:21.407
- We took a plaster
cast of shoeprints

16:21.408 --> 16:23.475
from the roof where
Matt was killed.

16:23.476 --> 16:26.512
Will we find parkour
shoes in your apartment?

16:26.513 --> 16:30.549
- I wouldn't kill Matt.
We had the same goals.

16:30.550 --> 16:31.584
- Which were what?

16:31.585 --> 16:34.653
- Destroy the contractors.

16:34.654 --> 16:36.355
Ascalon, sun tech,

16:36.356 --> 16:38.490
halliburton, Blackwater...

16:38.491 --> 16:42.160
All the warmongering bastards.

16:45.932 --> 16:48.500
- Rebecca Landon claims
she and Matt Clark

16:48.501 --> 16:50.502
were both out to steal
classified data

16:50.503 --> 16:52.271
from private security companies.

16:52.272 --> 16:54.006
- To what end?
- They believe

16:54.007 --> 16:57.376
these companies break
the law with impunity.

16:57.377 --> 17:00.279
Making their secrets
public is the goal.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.582
- So Matt went to work for Naomi

17:03.583 --> 17:06.852
who used him as a mole
against Terrence Brooks.

17:06.853 --> 17:10.055
- Yeah, but we think that
Matt had his own agenda.

17:10.056 --> 17:12.191
And he... seized the opportunity

17:12.192 --> 17:14.926
to try and bring
both companies down.

17:14.928 --> 17:17.762
- Matt Clark is connected to...

17:17.763 --> 17:21.599
Naomi, Terrence, and Rebecca.

17:21.601 --> 17:23.535
And I have a migraine.

17:23.536 --> 17:26.238
- Well, there's one
other person... his mom...

17:26.239 --> 17:28.607
Who wouldn't be a
person of interest

17:28.608 --> 17:30.542
if she hadn't disappeared
the minute we told her

17:30.543 --> 17:31.977
Matt had died.

17:31.978 --> 17:34.546
- The question is
who killed Matt?

17:34.547 --> 17:39.051
- If we knew what data
Matt stole from Terrence,

17:39.052 --> 17:41.720
we might have a definite motive.

17:41.721 --> 17:43.188
- All right.

17:43.189 --> 17:45.291
Then throw a subpoena
on sun tech.

17:45.292 --> 17:47.126
Let's see what we get.

17:47.127 --> 17:49.561
- Rebecca Landon was
one of a select group

17:49.562 --> 17:52.331
of anonymous sources providing
classified information

17:52.332 --> 17:55.567
to websites like wikileaks...
Same as Matt Clark.

17:55.568 --> 17:58.170
- Matt was my employee.
- Matt played you.

17:58.171 --> 18:01.140
Just like he played Terrence,
which gives you motive.

18:01.141 --> 18:02.608
- You got a subpoena, all right?

18:02.609 --> 18:04.476
Everything Matt lifted from
Terrence is on those drives.

18:04.477 --> 18:06.312
- Which was what, exactly?

18:06.313 --> 18:09.081
- Matt found his poison pill.

18:09.082 --> 18:11.684
Terrence's protection.

18:11.685 --> 18:14.119
- Poison pill.

18:14.120 --> 18:16.155
I like that. A poison pill.

18:16.156 --> 18:18.757
So... so Terrence holds documents

18:18.758 --> 18:20.826
that could damage his enemies,

18:20.827 --> 18:22.961
and he threatens to
release them publicly

18:22.962 --> 18:24.997
in the event of his death?

18:24.998 --> 18:27.099
- His life insurance.

18:27.100 --> 18:30.001
- And Matt took it away.

18:34.640 --> 18:36.275
- All right, Chelsea
square diner.

18:36.276 --> 18:38.277
You guys hungry? Come on.

18:38.278 --> 18:39.812
They're open all night.

18:39.813 --> 18:41.780
Oh, yes.

18:41.781 --> 18:43.615
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

18:50.355 --> 18:52.455
These are the components
we collected at the site.

18:54.356 --> 18:56.858
Y- you traced the
partial lot number

18:56.859 --> 18:58.527
on this piece of battery?

18:58.528 --> 19:00.362
- Energizer sent
shipments of that lot

19:00.363 --> 19:01.930
to three different walmarts...

19:01.931 --> 19:03.532
In greenwich, new
haven, and Fairfield.

19:03.533 --> 19:05.367
- Wow. Your teams are
already there, huh?

19:05.368 --> 19:06.868
- Set off a bomb in New York,

19:06.869 --> 19:09.571
even a rinky dink like this,
you'll get our attention.

19:09.572 --> 19:11.873
We've got surveillance
tapes from Walmart

19:11.874 --> 19:15.711
and two dozen ATF and FBI
agents already in Connecticut.

19:15.712 --> 19:18.980
- This bomb is... old-school.

19:18.981 --> 19:20.549
You know?

19:20.550 --> 19:22.517
Like it's out of the '70s.

19:23.853 --> 19:25.087
- Naomi Halloran told us

19:25.088 --> 19:28.256
Matt was stealing secrets
from your company.

19:30.159 --> 19:33.161
- I'm sure she was very
pleased with herself.

19:33.162 --> 19:37.365
- Matt...Takes your secrets.

19:37.366 --> 19:39.401
Which include files
of hundreds of people

19:39.402 --> 19:42.137
who have thousands
of secrets to hide.

19:42.138 --> 19:45.140
Now, those files...

19:45.141 --> 19:46.608
They act as your life insurance.

19:46.609 --> 19:48.443
What do they... what
do they call it?

19:48.444 --> 19:50.712
- A poison pill?
- Right, poison pill.

19:50.713 --> 19:52.614
Now, Matt, he takes
your poison pill.

19:52.615 --> 19:56.151
Now, what he knew
could kill you.

19:56.152 --> 19:57.953
Actually, you know what,

19:57.954 --> 20:00.155
that actually gives him
a very good motive.

20:00.156 --> 20:01.790
- Look...

20:01.791 --> 20:05.393
You guys have my alibi.
I didn't kill anyone.

20:05.394 --> 20:07.162
- So Naomi's trying
to frame you?

20:07.163 --> 20:09.331
- Naomi's not stupid enough
to accuse me of murder.

20:09.332 --> 20:11.600
- She has a grudge, doesn't she?

20:11.601 --> 20:14.002
Her late husband John Halloran.

20:14.003 --> 20:17.773
Wasn't he a CIA station
chief in kabul?

20:17.774 --> 20:20.742
He was killed because
of a suicide bomber.

20:20.743 --> 20:23.812
Got in the building.
He was posing as an informant.

20:23.813 --> 20:25.347
Now, wasn't your company ascalon

20:25.348 --> 20:27.983
supposed to be
protecting that station?

20:27.984 --> 20:30.252
- It was a real tragedy.

20:30.253 --> 20:32.821
- Maybe she holds you
responsible for his death.

20:32.822 --> 20:34.756
- Oh, please.
John was a great soldier.

20:34.757 --> 20:36.158
He was a lousy husband.

20:36.159 --> 20:37.626
He screwed anything that moved,

20:37.627 --> 20:39.628
and she was bitter
as hell about it.

20:39.629 --> 20:41.596
Naomi and I fight over
government contracts.

20:41.597 --> 20:43.598
Period.

20:43.599 --> 20:44.933
- I loved John.

20:44.934 --> 20:47.335
We had difficulties like any
couple in the military,

20:47.336 --> 20:48.770
but Terrence Brooks is a liar.

20:48.771 --> 20:50.539
- Terrence claims
he was clueless

20:50.540 --> 20:52.541
about Matt's agenda
to steal his secrets.

20:52.542 --> 20:53.875
- He was.

20:53.876 --> 20:57.045
- Were you clueless Matt
was stealing from you?

20:57.046 --> 20:59.147
Come on, he was
working with hackers

20:59.148 --> 21:01.983
who published stolen
documents on the web.

21:01.984 --> 21:03.418
- We've never had
a document leak.

21:03.419 --> 21:05.153
Not one.

21:05.154 --> 21:06.721
- We'll verify that.

21:06.722 --> 21:08.790
- Okay.
If I wanted to kill him...

21:08.791 --> 21:10.659
Not my style, by the way...

21:10.660 --> 21:12.227
But if I did, why would
I have hired bodyguards

21:12.228 --> 21:15.730
to follow him after
work every day?

21:15.731 --> 21:17.666
You seriously thought
that I would put

21:17.667 --> 21:19.234
one of my most
valuable employees

21:19.235 --> 21:21.069
in Terrence's company
without protection?

21:21.070 --> 21:23.371
- But they were gone when he
went to the roof that night.

21:23.372 --> 21:24.973
Otherwise, he'd still be alive.

21:24.974 --> 21:27.542
- He must have sent them home.

21:27.543 --> 21:29.677
I guess he wanted to be alone.

21:34.416 --> 21:36.084
Make sure we get those
calls sent today.

21:36.085 --> 21:38.153
I don't want the time
getting away from us.

21:38.154 --> 21:40.355
- Pretty smart.

21:41.757 --> 21:43.592
You know, it's one thing
to try and frame me

21:43.593 --> 21:45.060
with a poison pill,

21:45.061 --> 21:47.829
but you could have killed me
with that amateur bomb of yours.

21:47.830 --> 21:49.698
- That wasn't me.

21:49.699 --> 21:52.000
You know, your company's

21:52.001 --> 21:54.002
killed thousands of people
all over the world.

21:54.003 --> 21:55.337
It ever occur to you

21:55.338 --> 21:58.039
that maybe somebody's
looking for some payback?

22:01.277 --> 22:02.711
- Was there anything
on the hard drives

22:02.712 --> 22:04.446
that Naomi gave us

22:04.447 --> 22:07.115
that would give Terrence
a reason to kill Matt?

22:07.116 --> 22:09.384
- I'm barely through half of it.
There's thousands of pages,

22:09.385 --> 22:11.419
but nothing that incriminates
any major contractor.

22:11.420 --> 22:13.088
No poison pill.

22:13.089 --> 22:14.689
- Okay.
- Hold on a minute.

22:14.690 --> 22:17.092
Naomi says Matt was
working for her.

22:17.093 --> 22:19.895
Terrence has an alibi for
the night of the murder.

22:19.896 --> 22:22.864
Rebecca is on Matt's team.

22:22.865 --> 22:24.666
So unless they're having
a lover's quarrel,

22:24.667 --> 22:26.134
she has no clear motive.

22:26.135 --> 22:29.704
- Uh, Stan, do me a favor.

22:29.705 --> 22:31.306
Look up the kanji tattoos

22:31.307 --> 22:33.608
that were on Rebecca
and Matt's wrists.

22:35.244 --> 22:36.311
- You called it, goren.

22:36.312 --> 22:37.779
Those kanji symbols
are the hallmark

22:37.780 --> 22:39.714
of the people's
liberation brigade.

22:39.715 --> 22:42.317
- Those were the dickwads

22:42.318 --> 22:45.253
who tried to blow up the
bull statue on wall street

22:45.254 --> 22:46.922
'75, '76.

22:46.923 --> 22:48.723
I was on mayor beame's
detail back then.

22:48.724 --> 22:50.492
- So if Rebecca's
with this group,

22:50.493 --> 22:52.894
makes sense she'd hold
Terrence responsible,

22:52.895 --> 22:54.996
try to blow him up.
- We saw her place.

22:54.997 --> 22:57.299
She's a 21st century
revolutionary.

22:57.300 --> 22:59.901
No bombs. Just computers.

22:59.902 --> 23:02.904
Now see if you can bring up, uh...

23:02.905 --> 23:05.407
The FBI mug shots

23:05.408 --> 23:08.310
from the pl brigade fugitives.

23:15.384 --> 23:18.519
We need to find Matt's mom.

23:19.922 --> 23:23.892
- You ran the minute we
told you mattas dead.

23:23.893 --> 23:26.328
You set off a bomb
in New York City

23:26.329 --> 23:29.898
and think you can
hide in new haven?

23:29.899 --> 23:32.901
It took atf agents
less than six hours

23:32.902 --> 23:34.669
to track you down.

23:34.670 --> 23:38.073
- You tried to kill
Terrence Brooks

23:38.074 --> 23:39.908
with the same exact
bomb you used

23:39.909 --> 23:41.910
to blow up the bull in '76.

23:41.911 --> 23:45.180
- He killed my son.

23:45.181 --> 23:47.082
- What makes you so sure?

23:47.083 --> 23:48.583
- The man's a mass murderer.

23:48.584 --> 23:52.654
He's killed hundreds of
civilians the world over.

23:52.655 --> 23:54.823
- Your son.

23:54.824 --> 23:56.591
The...

23:56.592 --> 23:58.793
Tattoo on your wrist...

23:58.794 --> 24:00.829
Makes it clear that you and Matt

24:00.830 --> 24:03.598
had the same ideals.

24:03.599 --> 24:05.333
You home-schooled him.

24:05.334 --> 24:08.203
You taught him Marx and mao,

24:08.204 --> 24:10.038
turned him into a revolutionary.

24:10.039 --> 24:11.873
- Mm.

24:11.874 --> 24:13.775
Beats being a cop.

24:20.549 --> 24:23.551
- Matt was extremely...
Intelligent.

24:23.552 --> 24:26.955
He hacked into ascalon's
computers and...

24:26.956 --> 24:29.290
Stole thousas of files.

24:29.291 --> 24:32.394
- He had 170 iq.
He was a genius.

24:32.395 --> 24:34.462
And Terrence Brooks killed him.

24:34.463 --> 24:36.464
- Why Terrence Brooks?

24:36.465 --> 24:39.234
Matt undoubtedly stole
from Naomi too.

24:39.235 --> 24:40.902
- She wouldn't kill him.

24:40.903 --> 24:44.873
- 'Cause boots on the
ground isn't her thing?

24:44.874 --> 24:47.542
- Because they were lovers.

24:55.755 --> 24:58.457
Did you know that Matt
was sleeping with Naomi Halloran?

24:59.458 --> 25:00.825
No.

25:00.826 --> 25:03.294
That would be a
betrayal of the cause.

25:03.295 --> 25:05.263
Yes.

25:05.264 --> 25:07.398
Matt's mother told us

25:07.399 --> 25:10.668
that they were having
a relationship.

25:10.669 --> 25:13.905
But he was buying
you sexy lingerie.

25:13.906 --> 25:17.308
- The warrant came through.
We searched your apartment.

25:17.309 --> 25:20.912
We found parkour shoes, size 9.

25:20.913 --> 25:23.280
- I didn't kill Matt.

25:36.495 --> 25:40.431
- What happened?

25:40.432 --> 25:44.535
Something happened to you.

25:44.536 --> 25:47.338
- My friend is dead.

25:55.714 --> 25:57.982
- Take a break.

26:05.223 --> 26:08.526
We're digging a dry hole.

26:08.527 --> 26:10.261
Her answers have been rehearsed.

26:10.262 --> 26:11.796
She's been coached.

26:11.797 --> 26:13.398
- Where are we at
with the shoeprints?

26:13.399 --> 26:15.566
- Labs'll be back
within the hour.

26:15.567 --> 26:17.201
- Which will bring nothing,

26:17.202 --> 26:19.604
because there's probably been
hundreds of size 9 sold.

26:19.605 --> 26:21.038
- Any sunshine here?

26:21.039 --> 26:23.241
You can't put Naomi
at the scene,

26:23.242 --> 26:26.010
and assassination's not her m.O.

26:26.011 --> 26:27.745
- No. It's Terrence's.

26:27.746 --> 26:31.082
- Half his employees would kill
someone if he told them to,

26:31.083 --> 26:33.918
but [Stammers] Why would he?

26:33.919 --> 26:36.554
- Even if Rebecca threw
Matt Clark off the roof,

26:36.555 --> 26:38.222
someone ordered her to do it.

26:38.223 --> 26:40.124
- And for some reason,

26:40.125 --> 26:42.593
he had no bodyguards
to protect him.

26:44.596 --> 26:46.164
- How goes it, Stan?

26:46.165 --> 26:48.599
- I've been throrough 80%
of the stolen documents,

26:48.600 --> 26:50.601
and I've got nothing
incriminating...

26:50.602 --> 26:53.571
Just more internal memos,
innocuous emails.

26:55.240 --> 26:57.775
- Keep going.
- No...

26:57.776 --> 26:59.544
Don't bother.

26:59.545 --> 27:01.579
- There's still 8,000 pages.

27:03.048 --> 27:05.483
- There is no enemy trying
to take Terrence out.

27:05.484 --> 27:07.852
We have a grieving mother

27:07.853 --> 27:10.188
and no poison pill.

27:10.189 --> 27:14.225
I mean, all of our
document analysis

27:14.226 --> 27:17.595
is designed to waste our time.

27:28.173 --> 27:30.074
You didn't even flinch
when we told you

27:30.075 --> 27:32.710
that Matt had died.

27:32.711 --> 27:35.646
I guess...
You know, all the lying

27:35.647 --> 27:37.982
and hiding you've been doing...

27:37.983 --> 27:39.650
Playing it cool when a
cop pulls you over,

27:39.651 --> 27:42.253
gives you a ticket, you know...

27:42.254 --> 27:44.355
Been doing that stuff
since the '70s.

27:44.356 --> 27:46.491
You're tough, you know.

27:46.492 --> 27:49.393
Any normal mother
would have broken,

27:49.394 --> 27:53.498
but you...
You... you keep it together.

27:53.499 --> 27:55.966
- Do you have a
question, detective?

28:00.205 --> 28:03.608
- Here's one.

28:03.609 --> 28:05.076
What'd you do after we left?

28:05.077 --> 28:08.179
Did you cry then?

28:08.180 --> 28:10.681
- Here's one for you.

28:10.682 --> 28:14.151
Do you believe in anything
beyond that badge?

28:14.152 --> 28:15.453
Anything?

28:15.454 --> 28:19.090
- Well, I-I guess...

28:19.091 --> 28:22.093
I believe that victims
need an advocate.

28:22.094 --> 28:24.195
- And you have me in a cell?

28:24.196 --> 28:27.665
I've spent my entire life
fighting for the victims

28:27.666 --> 28:30.101
of racism, of imperialism,

28:30.102 --> 28:33.237
of the blind selfishness
of capitalism.

28:33.238 --> 28:35.706
Was it worth it?

28:38.610 --> 28:40.378
Did you bring down
the warmongers

28:40.379 --> 28:41.979
and the bankers?

28:41.980 --> 28:45.149
Did your...Revolution

28:45.150 --> 28:48.586
crush the capitalist system?

28:51.823 --> 28:56.226
They're all still there.
But your son's gone.

28:57.929 --> 29:01.132
This revolution...

29:01.133 --> 29:04.134
Was it worth his life?

29:15.180 --> 29:19.417
Look, I-if you want
justice for Matt,

29:19.418 --> 29:23.287
if you wanna bring
down a warmonger,

29:23.288 --> 29:25.556
I- I need your help.

29:28.293 --> 29:30.628
- How?

29:30.629 --> 29:32.630
- I've advised my client
that he's not under arrest

29:32.631 --> 29:34.298
and that this is just
an informal meeting.

29:34.299 --> 29:36.901
- No, of course, right.
We appreciate you coming in.

29:36.902 --> 29:39.637
- Captain, I've already told
your detectives all I know.

29:39.638 --> 29:41.806
- Well, I just wanted to
see where things are at

29:41.807 --> 29:43.407
with the case.

29:43.408 --> 29:46.510
Have a seat.

29:46.511 --> 29:48.312
- So, captain,
Terrence Brooks here,

29:48.313 --> 29:50.748
he...He protects American assets

29:50.749 --> 29:52.750
all over the world.

29:52.751 --> 29:55.620
You know, embassies, diplomats,
politicians abroad.

29:55.621 --> 29:57.855
He doesn't do it for
the money, do you?

29:57.856 --> 29:59.523
You... you're...

29:59.524 --> 30:01.158
A patriot.

30:01.159 --> 30:03.094
- That's very nice.

30:03.095 --> 30:05.329
You clearly know all the moves.

30:05.330 --> 30:07.465
But...
Then you were army intelligence,

30:07.466 --> 30:09.700
weren't you, detective?

30:09.701 --> 30:12.036
- He's also a former Navy seal,

30:12.037 --> 30:15.139
so he knows about
interrogation techniques too.

30:15.140 --> 30:17.775
- Pride and ego. Very effective.

30:17.776 --> 30:20.878
I would have started with
the direct approach, but...

30:20.879 --> 30:21.879
Good.

30:21.880 --> 30:24.048
- Okay. Fine.

30:24.049 --> 30:25.950
How's this?

30:25.951 --> 30:29.019
You killed Matt Clark,
and you had help.

30:30.522 --> 30:32.723
- That's direct.

30:36.828 --> 30:38.796
- What is he doing here?

30:38.797 --> 30:40.731
- We were told this was
an informal meeting.

30:40.732 --> 30:43.801
- Yes, it is.
I'm captain Joseph Hannah.

30:43.802 --> 30:45.836
Do you mind?

30:52.544 --> 30:56.814
- Hi. Well, we're just gonna...
You know,

30:56.815 --> 30:58.983
lay it all out for
you and... and, uh,

30:58.984 --> 31:02.019
tell you where we are.

31:04.189 --> 31:10.194
We found hard drives with data...

31:10.195 --> 31:13.397
Stolen by Matt Clark,
aka Ian masefield.

31:13.398 --> 31:16.233
Now, Matt belonged to...

31:16.234 --> 31:19.537
A group of computer thieves.

31:19.538 --> 31:21.539
- Who were stealing what?

31:21.540 --> 31:24.408
- Information.
Specifically your information.

31:24.409 --> 31:26.744
- Makes 'em traitors, right?

31:26.745 --> 31:29.180
- Where did you find
these hard drives?

31:29.181 --> 31:30.748
- Naomi gave them to us.

31:30.749 --> 31:34.518
She told us that Matt
stole them from Terrence.

31:34.519 --> 31:37.455
We think that Terrence
gave them to her.

31:38.790 --> 31:40.891
- Are you crazy?

31:40.892 --> 31:42.593
- Matt would hack information

31:42.594 --> 31:44.862
from the various companies
he infiltrated.

31:44.863 --> 31:47.398
Which...Wasn't hard, apparently.

31:47.399 --> 31:49.633
You both hired him, right?

31:49.634 --> 31:53.537
- Well...
Matt's skills were impressive.

31:57.275 --> 32:01.779
He was clean-cut, you know,
well-spoken, and, uh...

32:01.780 --> 32:03.847
Charming.

32:05.884 --> 32:09.620
So he gave these hacked files

32:09.621 --> 32:13.124
to Rebecca Landon.

32:13.125 --> 32:16.093
Rebecca made sure that it
was published on wikileaks.

32:16.094 --> 32:20.765
And wikileaks sent it...
Well...Everywhere.

32:20.766 --> 32:23.200
- Is there a charge lurking

32:23.201 --> 32:25.136
in this miasma of speculation?

32:25.137 --> 32:28.105
- So Naomi, she gave us

32:28.106 --> 32:32.143
these 50,000 ascalon documents.

32:32.144 --> 32:33.644
Oof.

32:33.645 --> 32:38.949
She told us that they were Terrence's...
Poison pill.

32:40.919 --> 32:43.520
And it's a lotta stuff.

32:54.999 --> 32:57.601
'Cause in actual fact,

32:57.602 --> 32:59.670
it's just thousands of pages
of useless information

32:59.671 --> 33:02.406
to mire us, designed
to waste our time

33:02.407 --> 33:04.942
and expose nothing.

33:04.943 --> 33:07.344
And that's when I knew.

33:07.345 --> 33:09.580
- What?

33:09.581 --> 33:12.783
What did you think
you knew, detective?

33:15.153 --> 33:16.954
- The two of you...

33:16.955 --> 33:18.455
You teamed up.

33:18.456 --> 33:21.759
- Oh, this is ridiculous.

33:21.760 --> 33:23.928
- Well, there was
a lot at stake.

33:23.929 --> 33:26.864
I mean, it would have
been ridiculous not to.

33:26.865 --> 33:30.935
- I wouldn't kill Matt Clark
over stolen documents.

33:30.936 --> 33:32.203
- That's right.

33:32.204 --> 33:34.705
A- and killing's not your style.

33:34.706 --> 33:36.774
- Don't say anything.

33:36.775 --> 33:39.543
- It's tough to meet
a man in New York.

33:39.544 --> 33:43.380
Who could measure up?
To your intellect, your income?

33:43.381 --> 33:45.216
It would have to be
someone very special.

33:45.217 --> 33:46.951
- Yeah. I think we'll end this.

33:46.952 --> 33:49.620
- Matt was special.

33:49.621 --> 33:51.889
He was handsome.

33:51.890 --> 33:56.527
And he was a genius. Or close.

33:56.528 --> 33:58.863
And you were in love.

33:58.864 --> 34:00.731
- Okay. I see.

34:00.732 --> 34:02.666
The omnipotent "we know
everything" technique.

34:02.667 --> 34:04.735
- No, no.
It's you that knows everything.

34:04.736 --> 34:07.471
I mean, you told
Naomi that Matt was

34:07.472 --> 34:09.473
sleeping with Rebecca.

34:09.474 --> 34:12.376
He told you that Matt was
a lying, cheating dog

34:12.377 --> 34:14.011
like your late husband.

34:14.012 --> 34:17.813
That must have made you crazy.

34:21.052 --> 34:26.891
Uh, captain?

34:26.891 --> 34:29.560
- Ladies and gentlemen... to th.

34:29.561 --> 34:32.830
- Our cell was small.
Four people.

34:32.831 --> 34:34.998
Just me, Matt,

34:35.000 --> 34:37.234
Rebecca, and her husband.

34:37.235 --> 34:39.536
- Rebecca has a husband?

34:39.536 --> 34:42.739
- I won't tell you his name.
He's like Matt.

34:42.741 --> 34:45.208
He infiltrates.

34:47.045 --> 34:48.913
- So Rebecca and Matt,

34:48.914 --> 34:52.382
their relationship was platonic.

34:52.384 --> 34:53.918
- I'd have been thrilled

34:53.918 --> 34:55.920
if he'd fallen in love
with someone like Rebecca.

34:55.920 --> 35:00.557
- So Matt had no sexual
relationship of any kind

35:00.558 --> 35:02.993
with Rebecca Landon.

35:02.994 --> 35:05.496
- No. Just Naomi.

35:05.497 --> 35:10.034
He called it love.

35:10.035 --> 35:14.104
I called it treason.

35:14.105 --> 35:18.342
- Matt made a purchase
at la petite coquette

35:18.343 --> 35:21.011
the day that he died.

35:21.012 --> 35:25.516
He bought a negligee... for you.

35:25.517 --> 35:27.251
- An hour later, someone
called the shop

35:27.252 --> 35:29.553
and had one sent to Rebecca
Landon, but it wasn't Matt.

35:29.554 --> 35:31.355
There are no records
from his phone

35:31.356 --> 35:33.023
that he called the shop.

35:33.024 --> 35:35.993
It was Terrence setting you up.

35:41.399 --> 35:43.534
- You motherf... -
Be cool, Naomi!

35:43.535 --> 35:44.735
- You're right! It was him.

35:44.736 --> 35:46.070
He told me that Matt
was sleeping around,

35:46.071 --> 35:49.940
that he was just like
John, and I lost it, I...

35:51.576 --> 35:53.444
I called off the bodyguards.
That's all I did.

35:53.445 --> 35:56.313
- Shut up.
- That's all you did...

35:56.314 --> 36:02.119
Was get the guy who loved you...
Killed.

36:02.120 --> 36:05.289
He betrayed his own cause
because he loved you,

36:05.290 --> 36:07.324
and that cost him his life.

36:07.325 --> 36:09.626
Well, maybe you
should mull that over

36:09.627 --> 36:12.096
for the next 25 years in prison

36:12.097 --> 36:13.831
for murder conspiracy.

36:26.544 --> 36:29.013
Well, she's confessed.
How about you?

36:29.014 --> 36:31.382
- This woman has libeled Mr.
Brooks for years.

36:31.383 --> 36:33.617
I'd love to put
her on the stand.

36:33.618 --> 36:35.619
- We don't need
Naomi's testimony

36:35.620 --> 36:38.122
to convict your client.

36:38.123 --> 36:42.692
See, we were just looking
for her confession.

36:48.166 --> 36:50.667
Boots on the ground.
That's your slogan, isn't it?

36:50.668 --> 36:52.536
- Yep.

36:52.537 --> 36:54.171
- These boots...

36:54.172 --> 36:56.740
We matched them to shoeprints

36:56.741 --> 36:58.542
at the murder scene.

36:58.543 --> 37:00.477
They're Rebecca's.

37:00.478 --> 37:02.346
- So?

37:02.347 --> 37:05.149
- You couldn't send one
of your own employees.

37:05.150 --> 37:10.154
Too much money at stake
if they got caught.

37:10.155 --> 37:13.290
So you sent a proxy.

37:16.227 --> 37:20.864
I hear that you have
family in Israel.

37:20.865 --> 37:25.202
How they doing?

37:25.203 --> 37:29.840
You have a brother and
sister back there?

37:29.841 --> 37:32.742
Cousins? Nieces? Nephews?

37:38.216 --> 37:42.286
- I got a call...
From Terrence Brooks.

37:42.287 --> 37:46.356
He told me my 12-year-old cousin

37:46.357 --> 37:49.159
had just died, a hit-and-run.

37:52.964 --> 37:56.967
The next time Terrence
called, I did what he asked.

37:56.968 --> 38:00.204
- Which was what?

38:00.205 --> 38:06.043
- Naomi called Matt to the
roof where they sometimes met.

38:06.044 --> 38:09.213
I was there instead.

38:09.214 --> 38:12.415
He tried to fight back.

38:13.951 --> 38:15.785
- But he's not a
trained fighter.

38:17.522 --> 38:22.159
- It was him or my family.

38:22.160 --> 38:24.428
My God...

38:24.429 --> 38:27.264
What have I done?

38:27.265 --> 38:32.669
- He put you in a position that
no one should have to face.

38:32.670 --> 38:34.771
He's a monster.

38:38.042 --> 38:41.678
- Matt was in the business of
putting you out of business.

38:41.679 --> 38:44.881
So he needed to die.

38:46.884 --> 38:50.687
You had an innocent
12-year-old girl killed

38:50.688 --> 38:53.123
to force Rebecca to kill Matt.

38:55.693 --> 39:00.497
But at the least you're
going to prison.

39:00.498 --> 39:02.832
Rebecca's testifying
against you.

39:24.589 --> 39:27.291
- These two, then Rebecca,

39:27.292 --> 39:28.625
and elise Clark.

39:28.626 --> 39:31.027
- Everybody goes to jail.

39:43.241 --> 39:45.709
- I thought about what you said.

39:45.710 --> 39:47.711
You know, I'm not afraid...

39:47.712 --> 39:50.314
I mean, maybe I am, but
you were right, you know.

39:50.315 --> 39:54.051
I- I... my world is treacherous.

39:54.052 --> 39:55.685
- I need you to sit.

40:07.198 --> 40:09.199
- I have this friend, Louis.

40:09.200 --> 40:11.401
He works on cars.

40:11.402 --> 40:15.505
He told me that the biggest
mistake that people make

40:15.506 --> 40:16.873
is they have an old car.

40:16.874 --> 40:18.675
It's worn down.
It stalls all the time.

40:18.676 --> 40:20.844
They get the
transmission flushed,

40:20.845 --> 40:26.750
clean out all the
gunk, you know.

40:26.751 --> 40:30.320
But they kill it.

40:30.321 --> 40:32.055
You see, all that gunk,

40:32.056 --> 40:33.323
it was there for a reason.

40:33.324 --> 40:36.293
It was there to plug
up all the holes.

40:36.294 --> 40:39.196
Car never runs again.

40:39.197 --> 40:41.832
- You're afraid if you
get into this with me,

40:41.833 --> 40:43.800
you'll stop functioning?

40:43.801 --> 40:45.802
- Y-you're gonna say you
won't allow that to happen

40:45.803 --> 40:49.072
because...

40:49.073 --> 40:51.475
You know, I can trust you.

40:51.476 --> 40:54.377
- I wouldn't presume to
tell you who to trust.

40:56.080 --> 40:57.814
I do think it's interesting

40:57.815 --> 41:00.150
that you likened
yourself to an old car.

41:00.151 --> 41:04.554
Cars don't feel.
They stop and...Reflect.

41:04.555 --> 41:07.157
They're made to work, to go.

41:11.562 --> 41:12.829
- Um...

41:12.830 --> 41:15.832
My mother...

41:19.904 --> 41:22.005
She, you know...

41:22.006 --> 41:26.143
Did her best to take care of me.

41:26.144 --> 41:29.579
But she was mentally ill.
Schizorenic.

41:29.580 --> 41:32.115
- You were only a boy?

41:34.118 --> 41:36.086
- How old were you when
you first realized

41:36.087 --> 41:39.122
your mommy wasn't like
all the other mommies?

41:39.123 --> 41:41.825
- Seven.

41:43.761 --> 41:46.563
- Were you ashamed?
- And frightened.

41:46.564 --> 41:51.168
It's... it's my turn.

41:51.169 --> 41:54.771
- Detective?

41:54.772 --> 41:56.840
- I've talked to someone
about this before.

41:56.841 --> 41:59.343
- In therapy?
- No.

41:59.344 --> 42:01.311
In the interrogation room. I...

42:04.148 --> 42:07.317
I betrayed my family.
I pimped out my family

42:07.318 --> 42:11.788
to get a... a confession.

42:11.789 --> 42:14.825
You did what you had to.

42:14.826 --> 42:17.894
You always have.

42:17.895 --> 42:23.166
And I don't think you
betrayed your mother.

42:23.167 --> 42:27.204
But what have you
done for her son?

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
