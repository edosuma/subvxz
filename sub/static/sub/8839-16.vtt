ON THE OPTIC NERVE.

15:35.976 --> 15:37.810
APPARENTLY, HE HIT
THE BACK OF HIS HEAD
WHEN HE FELL,

15:37.978 --> 15:40.730
WHERE THE NERVE PASSES
VERY CLOSE TO THE SKULL.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.942
WILL HE STAY BLIND?

15:47.071 --> 15:49.906
I WISH I COULD
ANSWER THAT, BELLE.

15:50.074 --> 15:51.407
THERE IS SOME VISION.

15:51.575 --> 15:54.410
HE CAN DISTINGUISH
LIGHT AND DARK...

15:54.578 --> 15:56.788
Dr. Baker:
BUT THERE IS IMPAIRMENT.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.415
I'D LIKE TO KEEP
HIM HERE A WHILE
AND WATCH HIM.

16:01.418 --> 16:03.586
HE HAS TO
SEE AGAIN.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.929
IT'S GOING TO BE
ALL RIGHT, JORDAN.

16:13.097 --> 16:16.099
DR. BAKER JUST WANTS
YOU TO STAY FOR A WHILE.

16:16.266 --> 16:19.936
HE TOLD ME.
ARE YOU HERE, PA?

16:20.104 --> 16:21.896
I'M HERE.

16:22.064 --> 16:23.439
DON'T FRET, NOW.

16:23.607 --> 16:24.649
WE'LL FETCH
YOU HOME

16:24.817 --> 16:26.067
AS SOON AS
THE DOC SAYS.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.777
BUT YOU SAID YOU
WERE GOING AWAY.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.946
YOU WON'T BE HERE.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.156
Timothy:
I'LL BE HERE.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.909
Jordan:
YOU PROMISE?

16:35.077 --> 16:36.744
I PROMISE.

16:51.301 --> 16:53.469
I COULDN'T SLEEP.

16:53.637 --> 16:54.637
I WARMED UP SOME MILK.

16:54.805 --> 16:56.222
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME?

16:57.933 --> 17:00.810
HOW COULD SOMETHING
LIKE THIS HAPPEN?

17:00.978 --> 17:02.562
Timothy:
I DON'T KNOW.

17:04.648 --> 17:08.943
ALWAYS DREAMING
ABOUT THAT CIRCUS.

17:09.111 --> 17:12.447
DAMN FOOL CIRCUS.

17:12.614 --> 17:14.532
THAT CIRCUS, THAT
CIRCUS, THAT CIRCUS!

17:14.700 --> 17:17.076
BELLE, STOP IT,
NOW, STOP IT!

17:17.244 --> 17:19.579
HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT!
HE'LL SEE AGAIN!

17:19.747 --> 17:20.955
WE DON'T
KNOW THAT!

17:21.123 --> 17:22.165
HE WILL.

17:22.332 --> 17:24.333
I PRAY HE DOES.

17:24.501 --> 17:25.918
BUT IF HE DOESN'T,

17:26.086 --> 17:27.545
HE'LL NEED US
TO HELP HIM,

17:27.713 --> 17:30.006
TO GIVE HIM STRENGTH.

17:30.174 --> 17:33.342
HE'LL SEE AGAIN.

17:33.510 --> 17:35.928
DON'T SAY THAT
IN FRONT OF HIM.

17:38.807 --> 17:42.018
WE'LL MAKE HIM BELIEVE
SOMETHING THAT
MIGHT NOT BE SO.

18:10.506 --> 18:11.631
MORNING,
TIMOTHY.

18:11.799 --> 18:12.840
CHARLES.

18:13.008 --> 18:14.133
HOW'S THE BOY?

18:14.301 --> 18:16.052
NO CHANGE.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.720
IT'S ONLY
BEEN A WEEK.

18:17.888 --> 18:20.556
CHARLES, I'M NOT
LOOKING FOR MIRACLES
LIKE BELLE IS.

18:20.724 --> 18:23.142
I WANT JORDAN TO
START BLIND SCHOOL.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.894
THAT'S WHY
I STOPPED BY.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.814
I WONDER IF
YOU'D TALK TO MARY
ABOUT IT FOR ME.

18:27.981 --> 18:30.358
CERTAINLY, I WILL.

18:30.526 --> 18:33.111
I WANTED BELLE
TO TALK TO HER,
BUT SHE WOULDN'T.

18:33.278 --> 18:36.572
SHE...DOESN'T
WANT HIM TO GO.

18:36.740 --> 18:39.909
SAYS IT MEANS
WE'RE...GIVING UP.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.245
HOW DOES JORDAN
FEEL ABOUT IT?

18:43.914 --> 18:45.915
HE SAYS HE'LL DO
ANYTHING WE WANT.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.876
HE'S BEEN THE BRAVE ONE
THROUGH ALL THIS.

18:49.044 --> 18:51.921
Timothy:
BEEN IN GOOD SPIRITS
THE WHOLE TIME.

18:52.089 --> 18:55.216
Charles: LOOK, I'LL TALK
TO MARY, AND I'LL STOP BY
YOUR PLACE RIGHT AFTER WORK.

18:55.384 --> 18:56.551
Timothy:
MUCH OBLIGED.

18:56.718 --> 18:57.927
Charles:
NO PROBLEM.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.934
LAURA, YOU TELL
CARRIE AND ALBERT
TO GET READY FOR SCHOOL.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.686
Charles:
I'LL DRIVE YOU IN.

19:26.623 --> 19:29.292
Charles:
SEE YOU KIDS
AFTER SCHOOL.

19:29.459 --> 19:31.085
Albert:
SEE YOU, PA.

19:43.473 --> 19:45.308
PA?

19:45.475 --> 19:47.185
YEAH, DARLING?

19:49.813 --> 19:51.731
IF JORDAN STARTS
SCHOOL HERE,

19:51.899 --> 19:52.899
I CAN HELP HIM--

19:53.066 --> 19:55.484
LIKE, WALK HIM
TO SCHOOL AND ALL.

19:55.652 --> 19:57.195
SURE. I'LL ASK
MR. HARRISON.

19:58.363 --> 20:01.949
I COULD HELP HIM
WITH HIS SCHOOLWORK, TOO.

20:02.117 --> 20:04.410
I COULD TEACH HIM
TO USE A BRAILLE WRITER.

20:05.537 --> 20:08.664
HEY, NOW, COME ON.

20:08.832 --> 20:10.958
I KNOW YOU'RE
UPSET ABOUT JORDAN.

20:11.126 --> 20:12.835
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
LET HIM DO IT.

20:13.003 --> 20:14.086
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD HIM.

20:14.254 --> 20:15.504
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, THAT'S ENOUGH.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.131
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS
BEFORE, HAVEN'T WE?

20:17.299 --> 20:18.841
IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.011
LOOK, I DON'T MIND
YOU HELPING JORDAN

20:22.179 --> 20:23.512
AS A FRIEND,
BUT I DON'T WANT

20:23.680 --> 20:27.725
YOU HELPING HIM
OUT OF SOME FALSE
SENSE OF GUILT.

20:27.893 --> 20:30.686
WHICH ONE IS IT?

20:30.854 --> 20:32.480
AS A FRIEND.

20:32.648 --> 20:33.981
YOU SURE?

20:36.568 --> 20:38.194
ALL RIGHT.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.655
I'LL TALK TO
MR. HARRISON.

20:40.822 --> 20:42.698
NOW, YOU GET
YOURSELF ON
TO SCHOOL.

20:59.549 --> 21:01.550
I WISH YOU
HADN'T DONE IT.

21:01.718 --> 21:04.303
I DON'T THINK WE
HAVE MUCH CHOICE.

21:04.471 --> 21:07.598
HE'LL NEED LEARNING,
BLIND OR NOT.

21:11.228 --> 21:14.855
BUT SENDING HIM
TO THAT SCHOOL...

21:15.023 --> 21:17.733
Timothy: IT MAKES
IT SEEM FINAL.

21:17.901 --> 21:19.986
MAYBE IT IS.

21:23.782 --> 21:25.324
COME ON.

21:25.492 --> 21:27.451
COME ON, NOW.

21:27.619 --> 21:30.454
WE PROMISED WE'D
BE STRONG FOR HIM,
DIDN'T WE?

21:30.622 --> 21:31.789
Timothy:
DIDN'T WE?

21:31.957 --> 21:33.457
YES.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.918
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

21:36.086 --> 21:37.420
ALL RIGHT.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.715
I'LL GO CHECK
ON THE BOY.

21:48.056 --> 21:49.307
TIM?

21:53.520 --> 21:55.187
THANK YOU.

22:21.256 --> 22:23.883
GIVE US THE STRENGTH
TO HELP HIM, GOD.

23:02.464 --> 23:03.672
Albert: HI, JORDAN!

23:03.840 --> 23:05.257
Laura: HI, JORDAN.

23:10.931 --> 23:12.181
SEE YOU AFTER
SCHOOL, SON.

23:12.349 --> 23:13.349
Jordan: OKAY.

23:13.517 --> 23:14.850
BE SURE AND THANK LAURA
FOR HELPING YOU.

23:15.018 --> 23:18.396
I WILL.

23:30.033 --> 23:31.117

THAT LETTER?

23:31.284 --> 23:32.326
"L."

23:32.494 --> 23:34.203
YOU'RE CATCHING ON
VERY QUICKLY, JORDAN.

23:34.371 --> 23:36.080

AFTER ALL, IS IT?

JORDAN, DOING?

23:44.548 --> 23:46.966
HE'S DOING
JUST FINE.

YOU THINK YOU'RE
ABOUT READY FOR
SOME OF MY COOKING?

23:50.053 --> 23:51.053
I COULD EAT
A HORSE.

23:51.221 --> 23:52.888
WELL, THAT'S
NOT ON THE MENU,

23:53.056 --> 23:55.141
BUT YOU THINK
YOU COULD STAND
SOME CHICKEN?

23:55.308 --> 23:57.601
AS LONG AS THE
FEATHERS ARE OFF.

24:04.568 --> 24:07.611

ARE ABOUT TO RECEIVE.

24:09.030 --> 24:10.531
All: AMEN.

TELLING TIME.

TALKED ABOUT YET.

LIKE ME TO TAKE YOU?

FIND MY WAY EASILY.

MAKING EVERYBODY THINK
YOU WERE BLIND.

YOU MADE EVERYBODY
FEEL JUST AWFUL!

I HAD TO.

29:41.237 --> 29:43.739
NOBODY ELSE WOULD DO
A THING LIKE THAT.

30:03.384 --> 30:05.469
AT FIRST,
I WASN'T.
HONEST.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.387
EVERYTHING
WAS BLURRY.

30:09.432 --> 30:11.350
WELL, WHY, THEN?

30:11.518 --> 30:12.726
WHY?

30:14.437 --> 30:16.647
BECAUSE WHEN I CAME TO,

30:16.815 --> 30:19.358
I SAW MY MA AND PA...

30:19.526 --> 30:21.109
AND HE WAS HOLDING HER,

30:21.277 --> 30:24.488
AND SHE WAS CRYING
AND HANGING ON TO HIM.

30:24.656 --> 30:25.948

MADE HER FEEL WORSE

YOU WERE BLIND.

30:31.955 --> 30:34.832

TO GET A DIVORCE.

30:34.999 --> 30:38.085
THEY USED TO GET
AWFUL MAD AT EACH OTHER.

30:38.253 --> 30:40.212
AND THAT WAS ALL
STOPPED WHEN THEY

30:40.380 --> 30:42.422
THOUGHT I WAS BLIND.

30:42.590 --> 30:45.300

WERE SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

STAY TOGETHER,

BUT I'M SCARED
TO FIND OUT.

31:16.958 --> 31:19.001
YOU'RE IN A PICKLE, JORDAN.
YOU REALLY ARE.

31:20.086 --> 31:22.880
I KNOW. YOU WON'T
TELL ON ME, WILL YOU?

31:25.258 --> 31:26.884
WELL, IT'S A SIN TO LIE.

31:27.051 --> 31:29.803
Jordan:
IT'S NOT LYING IF YOU
DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

31:29.971 --> 31:31.680
YES, IT IS, SORT OF.

31:32.765 --> 31:35.100
NOT REALLY.
PLEASE?

31:37.353 --> 31:39.521
WELL, HOW LONG DO
YOU PLAN TO KEEP
ON PRETENDING?

31:39.689 --> 31:41.732
I DON'T KNOW.

31:41.900 --> 31:45.360
Laura:
WELL, YOU'VE GOT
TO STOP SOMETIME.

31:45.528 --> 31:47.154
Albert: JORDAN!

31:47.322 --> 31:50.157
JORDAN, WHERE
ARE YOU?

31:51.075 --> 31:52.075
IT'S ALBERT.

31:52.243 --> 31:53.660
HE'S BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.

31:53.828 --> 31:56.538
EVERYBODY IN
THE SCHOOL'S BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.

31:56.706 --> 31:58.916
DON'T TELL
ON ME, PLEASE?

32:01.711 --> 32:04.171
ALL RIGHT, I WON'T
UNLESS THEY ASK ME.

32:05.798 --> 32:08.550
HE'S HERE!
I FOUND HIM!

32:14.849 --> 32:16.224
COME ON.

32:25.109 --> 32:27.235
HEY, HALF-PINT.

32:27.403 --> 32:28.904
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

32:29.072 --> 32:30.864
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU GOT
THE WOES OF THE WORLD
ON YOUR SHOULDERS.

32:31.032 --> 32:32.658
I'VE GOT
A PROBLEM.

32:32.825 --> 32:35.786
DO YOU WANT TO
TALK ABOUT IT?

32:35.954 --> 32:39.414
TROUBLE IS, I CAN'T
TALK ABOUT IT.

32:39.582 --> 32:41.583
WELL, THAT IS
A PROBLEM, THEN.

32:41.751 --> 32:43.919
WELL, IT'S NOT MINE,
THAT'S WHY.

32:44.087 --> 32:46.755
I'M JUST SORT OF
MIXED UP IN IT.

32:46.923 --> 32:49.424
PA, IS IT LYING IF YOU
KNOW ABOUT SOMETHING

32:49.592 --> 32:51.301
AND YOU DON'T SAY
WHAT IT IS?

32:51.469 --> 32:53.595
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
YOU GOT TO GIVE ME
A "FOR INSTANCE."

32:54.973 --> 32:56.932
I CAN'T.

32:57.100 --> 32:58.266
WELL, ALL I CAN SAY
IS THAT IT DEPENDS.

32:58.434 --> 33:00.602
I MEAN, IS NOT TELLING
HURTING SOMEBODY?

33:01.521 --> 33:04.439
NO.

33:04.607 --> 33:06.441
YES.

33:06.609 --> 33:08.026
LITTLE BIT
OF BOTH, HUH?

33:10.738 --> 33:13.532
WHICH ONE DO YOU
THINK IS THE BIGGER
OF THE TWO?

33:13.700 --> 33:15.784
I DON'T KNOW.

33:15.952 --> 33:17.327
I WISH I COULD
GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE,

33:17.495 --> 33:20.622
BUT I KNOW I CAN
TRUST YOU TO MAKE
THE RIGHT DECISION.

33:21.749 --> 33:23.250
I HOPE SO.

33:24.460 --> 33:25.961
I'D BEST GET
TO MY CHORES.

33:26.129 --> 33:27.587
OKAY.

33:37.515 --> 33:40.308
WELL, I THINK
WE'VE DONE ENOUGH
FOR TODAY.

33:40.476 --> 33:41.476
YEAH, PA.

33:41.644 --> 33:44.187
LET'S GO SIT
WITH MA.

33:44.355 --> 33:45.647
Belle:
YOU GETTING TIRED, SON?

33:45.815 --> 33:46.815
Jordan: NOT REALLY.

33:46.983 --> 33:50.736
Belle:
NO? HERE.
HERE WE GO.

33:50.903 --> 33:52.529
THERE.

33:52.697 --> 33:56.658
WELL, GOT TO
GET TO WORK.

33:56.826 --> 33:58.201
DON'T BE GONE
TOO LATE, TONIGHT.

33:58.369 --> 33:59.578
- ALL RIGHT.
- BYE, PA.

33:59.746 --> 34:00.829
BYE.

34:00.997 --> 34:02.748
WANT TO HELP ME
DO SOME BEANS UP
FOR SUPPER?

34:02.915 --> 34:05.625
OKAY.

34:05.793 --> 34:06.835
Belle:
THAT'S A BOY.

34:07.003 --> 34:08.879
PUT THEM RIGHT IN
THAT BUCKET, THERE.

34:11.174 --> 34:13.842
LAURA, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING OVER THIS WAY?

34:14.010 --> 34:16.011
I MADE A BATCH
OF COOKIES, SO
I BROUGHT SOME OVER.

34:16.179 --> 34:17.971
OH, HOW NICE!

34:18.139 --> 34:19.514
WELL, I THINK
THAT CALLS FOR
SOME LEMONADE

34:19.682 --> 34:20.849
TO GO WITH
THEM, HMM?

34:21.017 --> 34:22.726
YEAH. TO WASH
THE TASTE OUT.

34:22.894 --> 34:24.394
JORDAN.

34:32.862 --> 34:34.654
WELL, HAVE YOU
MADE UP YOUR MIND?

34:34.822 --> 34:35.822
SOME.

34:35.990 --> 34:37.449
I'M FIGURING
OUT A WAY.

34:37.617 --> 34:38.992
WELL, YOU GOT
TO HURRY UP.

34:39.160 --> 34:41.828
I'M JUST NOT GOING
TO GO ALONG WITH IT
ANY LONGER.

34:41.996 --> 34:44.289
LAURA, PLEASE, JUST
GIVE ME TILL MONDAY.

34:44.457 --> 34:45.540
WHY NOT NOW?

34:45.708 --> 34:47.167
IT HAS TO BE MONDAY.

34:47.335 --> 34:49.211
[DOOR OPENS]

34:49.378 --> 34:50.712
LET'S HAVE
OUR PARTY INSIDE.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.923
IT'S MUCH COOLER.

34:53.091 --> 34:54.257
JORDAN.

34:54.425 --> 34:55.759
- MA?
- YES?

34:55.927 --> 34:58.970
IT TAKES SO LONG
WALKING ME TO SCHOOL
EVERY MORNING,

34:59.138 --> 35:00.305
I WAS WONDERING
IF LAURA

35:00.473 --> 35:03.100
COULD LEAD ME
ON HORSEBACK
STARTING MONDAY.

35:03.267 --> 35:04.518
OH,
I DON'T KNOW.

35:04.685 --> 35:05.811
WELL, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY.

35:05.978 --> 35:08.105
I CAN SIT
A HORSE OKAY.

35:08.272 --> 35:10.107
WELL, WE'LL
ASK YOUR PA.
HOW'S THAT?

35:10.274 --> 35:12.484
- Jordan: FINE.
- Belle: OKAY.

35:18.032 --> 35:20.408
Belle: LAURA?
COME ON.

35:20.576 --> 35:21.910
YES, MA'AM.

35:43.558 --> 35:45.183
WHOA, BOY.

35:45.351 --> 35:46.560
WHAT ARE YOU
UP TO, ANYWAY?

35:46.727 --> 35:48.478
YOU HAVEN'T TOLD
THEM A THING.

35:48.646 --> 35:49.563
I GOT A PLAN.

35:49.730 --> 35:51.731
IT'LL WORK,
YOU'LL SEE.

35:51.899 --> 35:52.941
DR. BAKER SAID
MY BLINDNESS

35:53.109 --> 35:55.277
CAME FROM
PRESSURE
BACK HERE,

35:55.444 --> 35:57.112
AND IF THE
PRESSURE'S
RELIEVED,

35:57.280 --> 35:59.281
WELL, MAYBE I
COULD SEE AGAIN.

35:59.448 --> 36:02.576
MAYBE IF I FALL
ON ANOTHER BUMP,
IT WOULD DO IT.

36:03.619 --> 36:05.662
YOU'RE GOING TO FALL
OFF THE HORSE?

36:07.373 --> 36:09.457
JORDAN, THAT'S
THE MEANEST, ROTTENEST,
CHEATINGEST THING

36:09.625 --> 36:12.460
I'VE EVER HEARD OF,
AND I WON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.

36:12.628 --> 36:14.671
LAURA, PLEASE.

36:14.839 --> 36:17.883
WELL, YOU JUST GOT
TO TELL THEM STRAIGHT OUT
THAT YOU BEEN FAKING.

36:20.970 --> 36:23.346
I CAN'T.

36:23.514 --> 36:26.558
WELL, I'M NOT GOING
TO LET YOU PILE ONE
FAKE ON TOP OF ANOTHER.

36:26.726 --> 36:28.727
I'M JUST GOING TO
TELL THEM MYSELF.

36:29.645 --> 36:30.687
LAURA, PLEASE!

36:30.855 --> 36:32.314
[HORSE NEIGHS]

36:37.278 --> 36:39.654
ALL RIGHT,
YOU WENT AHEAD
AND DID IT, ANYWAY,

36:39.822 --> 36:41.156
BUT IT'S NOT GOING
TO DO ANY GOOD.

36:41.324 --> 36:42.824
I'M STILL
GOING TO TELL.

36:46.913 --> 36:48.288
DO YOU HEAR ME?

37:01.677 --> 37:04.679
JORDAN HARRISON, YOU
GET UP OFF THAT GROUND
THIS MINUTE.

37:04.847 --> 37:08.225
Laura: I'VE HAD ABOUT
ALL THE FAKING I'M GOING
TO TAKE FROM YOU.

37:12.104 --> 37:22.364
JORDAN?

37:26.744 --> 37:28.870
OH, DEAR GOD.

38:07.868 --> 38:09.744
I CLEANSED THE WOUND
AND STITCHED IT,

38:09.912 --> 38:11.371
BUT HE'S
STILL UNCONSCIOUS.

38:11.539 --> 38:12.664
I WANT
TO SEE HIM.

38:12.832 --> 38:14.332
BELLE.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.084
THERE IS
SOMETHING ELSE.

38:16.252 --> 38:18.044
WHAT IS IT,
DOC?

38:18.212 --> 38:19.963
A POSSIBLE
SKULL FRACTURE.

38:20.131 --> 38:23.008
HE'S NOT RESPONDING
TO STIMULI.

38:23.175 --> 38:24.259
IF HE REMAINS
UNCONSCIOUS,

38:24.427 --> 38:26.094
I WOULD RECOMMEND
TAKING HIM

38:26.262 --> 38:28.471
TO MINNEAPOLIS
FOR SURGERY.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.140
OH, MY GOD.

39:15.644 --> 39:18.772
IS HE GOING
TO DIE, PA?

39:18.939 --> 39:21.066
WE'LL PRAY
HE DOESN'T.

39:25.196 --> 39:29.532
DOES GOD REALLY
PUNISH PEOPLE LIKE
THE BIBLE SAYS?

39:29.700 --> 39:32.494
WELL, SOMETIMES
IT SEEMS SO.

39:32.661 --> 39:35.872
I DON'T THINK SO
MYSELF.

39:36.040 --> 39:40.126
WHY? DO YOU THINK
GOD'S PUNISHING JORDAN
FOR SOMETHING?

39:40.294 --> 39:42.253
I DON'T KNOW.

39:44.632 --> 39:47.509
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GO TO SCHOOL
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

39:47.676 --> 39:50.136
I DON'T FEEL
MUCH LIKE IT.

39:50.304 --> 39:52.639
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GO ON HOME, THEN, HUH?

39:52.807 --> 39:54.015
NO.

39:54.183 --> 39:57.143
I THINK I'LL JUST
TAKE A WALK...

39:57.311 --> 39:59.729
DO SOME THINKING.

39:59.897 --> 40:02.565
I'LL BE AT THE MILL
IF YOU NEED ME.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.331
GOD...

41:02.418 --> 41:04.961
JORDAN WAS JUST TRYING
TO HELP HIS MA AND PA.

41:05.129 --> 41:07.130
THAT'S WHY HE DID IT.

41:09.675 --> 41:12.302
MAYBE HE WAS GOING AGAINST
WHAT YOU WANTED,

41:12.470 --> 41:15.472
WHAT WITH HIM
LYING AND ALL,

41:15.639 --> 41:18.933
AND I GUESS I SHOULDN'T
HAVE GONE ALONG WITH IT,

41:19.101 --> 41:22.812
BUT HE JUST LOVES
HIS MA AND PA SO MUCH.

41:22.980 --> 41:25.690
HE ONLY WANTED
TO SEE THEM HAPPY.

41:25.858 --> 41:27.859
THAT'S WHY HE DID IT.

41:30.779 --> 41:34.574
AND IT JUST DON'T
SEEM RIGHT FOR YOU
TO PUNISH HIM FOR IT.

41:40.372 --> 41:42.749
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT, GOD.

41:45.002 --> 41:48.129
I KNOW YOU KNOW
WHAT'S BEST,

41:48.297 --> 41:49.756
AND I GUESS
IT WAS PART MY FAULT

41:49.924 --> 41:52.175
FOR NOT TELLING
WHEN I SHOULD HAVE.

41:55.804 --> 41:59.015
PLEASE HELP JORDAN.

41:59.183 --> 42:00.683
PLEASE.

42:27.419 --> 42:29.504
NO CHANGE.

42:29.672 --> 42:32.340
IS IT ALL RIGHT
IF I STAY FOR A WHILE?

42:39.515 --> 42:41.015
DR. BAKER?

42:43.352 --> 42:44.394
WHEN YOU GET OLDER,

42:44.562 --> 42:46.187
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THINGS BETTER?

42:47.856 --> 42:49.440
IN SOME WAYS.

42:49.608 --> 42:52.193
NOT EVERYTHING.

42:52.361 --> 42:55.530
Dr. Baker:
THE ONE THING WE DO LEARN
WHEN WE GROW OLDER, LAURA,

42:55.698 --> 42:58.074
IS HOW LITTLE WE KNOW.

43:00.411 --> 43:03.329
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO HELP HIM.

43:03.497 --> 43:05.582
Jordan: MA? PA?

43:05.749 --> 43:06.874
Timothy:
RIGHT HERE, SON.

43:07.042 --> 43:09.127
Belle: WE'RE BOTH
HERE, DARLING.

43:09.295 --> 43:10.378
SON.

43:10.546 --> 43:11.546
MY HEAD HURTS.

43:11.714 --> 43:13.756
YOU HAD
A BAD FALL.

43:16.594 --> 43:18.094
AND DR. BAKER...

43:21.056 --> 43:22.390
I'M IN YOUR OFFICE.

43:22.558 --> 43:25.018
Jordan:
HOW'D I GET HERE?

43:25.185 --> 43:27.520
OH, DEAR GOD,
THANK YOU.

43:27.688 --> 43:29.230
THANK YOU.

43:32.067 --> 43:33.067
YOU CAN SEE.

43:33.235 --> 43:36.446
WELL, SURE
I CAN SEE, MA.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.114
Dr. Baker:
YOU WERE BLIND, SON.

43:38.282 --> 43:40.658
BLIND?

43:40.826 --> 43:43.036
NO, I WASN'T.

43:43.203 --> 43:45.747
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
FALLING AND HITTING
YOUR HEAD?

43:47.082 --> 43:49.959
I REMEMBER,
I FELL FROM A ROPE.

43:50.127 --> 43:52.629
Dr. Baker:
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
FALLING FROM A HORSE?

43:52.796 --> 43:54.505
Jordan:
NO. WHEN?

43:54.673 --> 43:55.757
Dr. Baker: DO YOU
KNOW YOUR NAME?

43:55.924 --> 43:57.717
Jordan: SURE.
JORDAN HARRISON.

43:57.885 --> 43:59.052
Dr. Baker:
YOUR BIRTHDAY?

43:59.219 --> 44:00.678
JUNE 17th.

44:01.805 --> 44:03.806
YEAH.

44:03.974 --> 44:05.516
WELL,
WHAT ABOUT TODAY?

44:05.684 --> 44:06.976
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?

44:07.144 --> 44:10.063
I TOLD YOU.
I FELL FROM A ROPE.

44:10.230 --> 44:13.066
LAURA WAS THERE.
SHE SAW IT.

44:13.233 --> 44:15.068
ALL RIGHT.

44:15.235 --> 44:16.944
HE'S HAD
A CONCUSSION.

44:17.112 --> 44:19.906
PARTIAL LOSS OF MEMORY
IS A COMMON RESULT.

44:20.074 --> 44:22.909
Belle: WILL HE
EVER REMEMBER?

44:23.077 --> 44:24.452
Dr. Baker:
PERHAPS.

44:24.620 --> 44:26.454
IT DOESN'T
REALLY MATTER.

44:27.623 --> 44:29.332
WILL HE BE ALL RIGHT
OTHERWISE?

44:29.500 --> 44:30.917
Dr. Baker:
I THINK SO.

44:31.085 --> 44:32.877
ANYONE WHO CAN COME OUT
OF THE TUMBLES HE HAS

44:33.045 --> 44:35.088
IS A PRETTY TOUGH
YOUNGSTER.

44:35.255 --> 44:38.299
I'D LIKE HIM
TO STAY WITH ME
FOR A DAY OR SO.

44:38.467 --> 44:41.594
AFTERWARDS,
HE'S GOT TO BE
A LITTLE MORE CAREFUL.

44:41.762 --> 44:42.762
YOUNG MAN,

44:42.930 --> 44:44.931
I SUGGEST YOU STAY OFF
SLACK ROPES

44:45.099 --> 44:47.725
AND WILD HORSES
FOR A WHILE.

45:02.074 --> 45:03.116
YOU GO ON.

45:03.283 --> 45:04.992
I WANT TO
SEE JORDAN.

45:05.160 --> 45:07.120
ISN'T HE GOING
HOME, TODAY?

45:07.287 --> 45:08.621
YEAH, BUT I WANT
TO SEE HIM, ANYWAY.

45:08.789 --> 45:10.164
OKAY.
SEE YOU.

45:21.135 --> 45:22.552
LAURA.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.303
CAN I SEE JORDAN
FOR A MINUTE?

45:24.471 --> 45:25.888
WELL, SURE, FOR AS
LONG AS YOU LIKE.

45:26.056 --> 45:28.808
HIS FOLKS WILL
BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

45:28.976 --> 45:30.560
HE'S SUPPOSEDLY
RESTING.

45:30.728 --> 45:31.894
[SNICKERS]

45:32.062 --> 45:33.563
THANKS.

45:45.409 --> 45:47.034
I WANT YOU TO
TELL ME SOMETHING,

45:47.202 --> 45:51.914
AND I WANT YOU
TO TELL ME THE TRUTH,
JORDAN HARRISON.

45:52.082 --> 45:53.833
ARE YOU
FAKING AGAIN?

45:54.001 --> 45:55.209
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
FAKING?

45:55.377 --> 45:56.919
SHH!

45:57.087 --> 45:59.088
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

45:59.256 --> 46:01.716
FAKING AND PRETENDING
YOU'RE BLIND.

46:01.884 --> 46:03.968
I DON'T!

46:04.136 --> 46:07.054
YOU MEAN YOU DON'T
REMEMBER BEING BLIND,

46:07.222 --> 46:08.765
OR GOING TO
THE BLIND SCHOOL,

46:08.932 --> 46:10.725
OR ALL THE PRETENDING
YOU'VE BEEN DOING?

46:10.893 --> 46:12.143
NO, I DON'T.

46:12.311 --> 46:16.314
AND WHY DO YOU
KEEP SAYING "FAKING"
AND "PRETENDING"?

46:16.482 --> 46:19.567
DO YOU SWEAR TO GOD
ON YOUR LIFE
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

46:19.735 --> 46:21.736
I SWEAR TO GOD
ON MY LIFE!

46:21.904 --> 46:24.155
COME ON, JORDAN,
YOUR FOLKS ARE WAITING.

46:37.127 --> 46:39.754
THERE YOU GO,
JORDAN.

46:39.922 --> 46:41.756
WE THANK YOU, DOC,
MORE THAN WE CAN SAY.

46:41.924 --> 46:43.424
I DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING.

46:43.592 --> 46:45.760
HE'S A WONDER,
THAT BOY.

46:45.928 --> 46:48.095
JUST KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

46:48.263 --> 46:51.641
IF HE SHOWS ANY SIGNS OF
DROWSINESS OR BLEEDING,
I WANT TO SEE HIM.

46:51.809 --> 46:53.559
NOTHING DROWSY
ABOUT HIM, NOW.

46:53.727 --> 46:55.853
Dr. Baker:
HUH. HE'LL BE FINE.

46:56.021 --> 46:57.146
TAKE CARE, JORDAN.

46:57.314 --> 46:58.397
I WILL, DOC.

46:58.565 --> 47:00.066
THANKS AGAIN,
DOCTOR.

47:02.110 --> 47:03.027
Jordan: PA?

47:03.195 --> 47:04.278
YEAH, SON?

47:04.446 --> 47:06.239
YOU KNOW, THERE'S LOTS
I DON'T REMEMBER.

47:06.406 --> 47:09.492
I KNOW. THE DOC SAID
NOT TO WORRY ABOUT IT.

47:12.704 --> 47:14.747
Jordan: LET'S GO HOME.

47:39.481 --> 47:42.066
Laura: THERE WAS
NO REASON, NOW,
FOR ME TO TELL ANYONE.

47:42.234 --> 47:44.569
GOD HAD MADE UP HIS MIND
HOW HE WANTED IT.

47:44.736 --> 47:46.362
JORDAN NEVER DID REMEMBER.

47:46.530 --> 47:49.866
IF HE HAD, I THINK HE WOULD
HAVE TOLD HIS FOLKS--

47:50.033 --> 47:51.534
I THINK.
