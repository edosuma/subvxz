WEBVTT

00:00.500 --> 00:02.034
Okay. Let's do this.

00:06.373 --> 00:08.073
[woman 1]<i> Here she comes.</i>

00:08.108 --> 00:09.341
[shouting]

00:11.111 --> 00:12.611
[screaming]

00:12.645 --> 00:14.480
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:14.514 --> 00:15.514
I feel good.

00:15.548 --> 00:16.782
Girl, you look so good.

00:16.816 --> 00:17.549
[woman 2] Oh, hello.

00:17.584 --> 00:18.484
Yes, please.

00:18.518 --> 00:20.686
Congratulations. [kisses]

00:20.720 --> 00:24.323
Oh, my God, you guys
are getting emotional!

00:24.357 --> 00:25.424
Could this really be the one?

00:25.458 --> 00:26.558
I don't like that dress.

00:26.593 --> 00:28.160
Pray for me.

00:28.194 --> 00:29.228
When is your wedding?

00:29.262 --> 00:30.362
Oh, it's six weeks away.

00:30.397 --> 00:31.563
That's a hell no.

00:31.598 --> 00:33.365
- You don't like anything?
- Mmm-mmm.

00:34.467 --> 00:35.667
I don't like the energy.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.403
We'll deal with your mother.

00:37.437 --> 00:39.304
Bridal glitter. Here we come.

00:40.607 --> 00:43.175
<i>♪ Are you ready? ♪</i>

00:43.209 --> 00:44.543
[all cheering]

00:44.577 --> 00:46.612
I grew up watching<i> Dance Moms,</i>

00:46.646 --> 00:48.747
and I recognized you guys.

00:48.782 --> 00:51.250
I will not settle for anything
less than perfection.

00:51.284 --> 00:52.384
What she said.

00:52.419 --> 00:53.852
I dropped a dress.

00:53.887 --> 00:58.123
I'm Randy Fenoli's assistant
on<i> Say Yes To The Dress.</i>

00:58.158 --> 01:00.459
I'm the bride for once.
How wild is that?

01:00.493 --> 01:01.894
- Beautiful.
- Yeah.

01:01.928 --> 01:03.295
I'm not feeling this at all.

01:04.097 --> 01:05.164
[gasps]

01:06.399 --> 01:10.702
This shows every little
bump and bulge and ripple.

01:10.737 --> 01:15.874
I've never seen this brutally
honest side of Randy before.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.477
I bought the dress,
on a virtual appointment,

01:18.511 --> 01:20.746
and I've never seen it
in person.

01:21.481 --> 01:23.148
And my wedding is in six weeks.

01:24.384 --> 01:25.651
Is that what it looks like?
Oh, no!

01:25.685 --> 01:27.352
This was not a good decision.

01:28.288 --> 01:29.388
I love this.

01:30.090 --> 01:30.989
No!

01:32.225 --> 01:33.559
Mom knows best.

01:33.593 --> 01:36.528
I know what your best is gonna
be. And I know when we see it.

01:36.563 --> 01:37.963
Next.

01:39.799 --> 01:44.169
She's Randy Fenoli's assistant. At
Kleinfeld's we have to find her something.

01:44.204 --> 01:45.537
I hate the dress.

01:45.572 --> 01:48.373
Sometimes brides come in
and they don't find the dress.

01:48.408 --> 01:50.209
We don't always
have a "Say yes."

02:03.623 --> 02:06.225
[Randy] Ooh! Uh-oh.
Let me move this.

02:06.259 --> 02:07.659
[objects clattering]

02:07.694 --> 02:10.729
Oh, my gosh.
What a year it has been.

02:10.763 --> 02:15.300
I'm actually here at my home
in Florida, because of COVID

02:15.335 --> 02:16.702
and because I really wanted

02:16.736 --> 02:19.838
to take care of my mother,
who hasn't been doing really well.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.607
<i>I wanted to be closer to her.</i>

02:21.641 --> 02:23.041
And like so many
people out there,

02:23.076 --> 02:25.577
when you're stuck at home, you're
looking around and seeing things,

02:25.612 --> 02:26.879
that you wish you had done.

02:26.913 --> 02:31.250
I have been wanting to renovate
my house now, for five years.

02:31.284 --> 02:32.417
- [loud thud]
- There we go!

02:33.052 --> 02:33.652
[groaning]

02:33.686 --> 02:35.020
Don't get your foot caught.

02:35.054 --> 02:38.590
<i>Then we had to cover everything
because of dust is everywhere.</i>

02:38.625 --> 02:41.326
Hey, Chewie! Hey, boo-boo!

02:41.361 --> 02:42.895
I have to say that
I never thought

02:42.929 --> 02:46.809
<i>it was gonna be this wild and
crazy doing these renovations.</i>

02:46.833 --> 02:52.171
But the good thing is, I still get to
work virtually with my brides at Kleinfeld.

02:54.908 --> 02:58.477
<i>So, things are looking a little
different these days in Kleinfeld's.</i>

02:58.511 --> 03:01.513
<i>There's plexiglass walls,
fewer appointments,</i>

03:01.548 --> 03:03.382
<i>we have to space them out.</i>

03:03.416 --> 03:05.484
<i>We have to sanitize the dresses,</i>

03:05.518 --> 03:08.854
<i>and even with all these
extra precautions in place,</i>

03:08.888 --> 03:11.857
<i>Kleinfeld is busy with brides
finding their dream gowns.</i>

03:11.891 --> 03:15.027
<i>And I'm thrilled, that I still
get to do what I love best...</i>

03:15.461 --> 03:16.795
<i>Helping brides.</i>

03:16.829 --> 03:18.797
Even if it is over the noise
of the jackhammers

03:18.831 --> 03:21.066
<i>and the buzz saws,
I get to do what I love.</i>

03:21.100 --> 03:21.867
Chewie, come here.

03:21.901 --> 03:23.769
We've got
a great appointment today.

03:23.803 --> 03:27.272
It's actually my on-set
production assistant, Daniela,

03:27.307 --> 03:28.607
<i>who's getting married soon.</i>

03:28.641 --> 03:32.277
So, let me get into my design
room and I gotta get to my work.

03:32.312 --> 03:33.245
[chuckles]

03:34.781 --> 03:38.517
It's our daily routine now,
logging in meetings

03:38.551 --> 03:40.118
and doing appointments
virtually.

03:40.153 --> 03:45.624
If it's a<i> Say Yes</i> shoot day, the first
thing I do is check in with my crew.

03:45.658 --> 03:46.825
There we go. How you guys doing?

03:46.859 --> 03:47.926
- Can you see us?
<i>- Yes.</i>

03:47.961 --> 03:51.597
Okay, good. Daniela's
on her way. We're excited.

03:51.631 --> 03:54.333
Yes, for Daniela appointment!
Whoo!

03:54.367 --> 03:55.534
What?

03:55.568 --> 03:56.635
This is crazy.

03:56.669 --> 03:59.238
You're gonna
say yes to the dress!

03:59.272 --> 04:01.006
[yells excitedly] Oh, my God.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.007
[both chuckle]

04:02.041 --> 04:04.810
[Daniela] Okay.
We can't die on the way there.

04:04.844 --> 04:08.714
[Randy]<i> Daniela's been my on-set production
assistant now for what, three years?</i>

04:08.748 --> 04:11.750
And five days a week at
Kleinfeld, eight hours a day.

04:11.784 --> 04:15.120
So, we spend
a lot of time together.

04:16.155 --> 04:17.256
- Hey.
- Hi.

04:17.290 --> 04:18.357
There's your water.

04:19.292 --> 04:20.525
Okay, copy that.

04:20.560 --> 04:23.262
There's a consultant on the
floor that's gonna need you.

04:23.296 --> 04:24.630
So, we gotta make it quick.

04:24.664 --> 04:26.932
I have to say, I have never heard
her talk about her wedding dress.

04:26.966 --> 04:28.634
I don't know
what she's gonna wear.

04:28.668 --> 04:31.536
To be honest, Randy,
she's barely talked about this.

04:31.571 --> 04:32.704
This is, like, a big deal.

04:32.739 --> 04:35.407
She did say
she doesn't want sparkle.

04:35.441 --> 04:36.441
- That's the only thing I've heard.
- Yeah.

04:36.476 --> 04:39.378
I see her in something
a little bit more relaxed.

04:39.412 --> 04:40.712
Almost like a boho kind of feel,

04:40.747 --> 04:43.315
<i>I'm thinking, but we'll see.
I'm excited.</i>

04:43.349 --> 04:44.449
[Norma] <i>Yeah, speak to you soon.</i>

04:44.484 --> 04:47.386
- Okay, bye.
- [Norma]<i> Okay. Bye.</i>

04:47.420 --> 04:51.623
<i>♪ Whoa! I'm the action ♪</i>

04:51.658 --> 04:53.625
<i>♪ Don't be waiting ♪</i>

04:53.660 --> 04:58.430
<i>♪ Whoa! You won't
know What hit ya... ♪</i>

05:00.233 --> 05:01.333
[crew member]

05:01.367 --> 05:02.401
[Daniela] Oh, hello.

05:02.435 --> 05:04.469
What's everyone
doing here today?

05:04.504 --> 05:08.340
Randy asked if we could
chat with you before we start.

05:08.374 --> 05:10.175
[Daniela] Of course.

05:10.209 --> 05:11.843
- [Randy]<i> Hi.</i>
- Hi.

05:11.878 --> 05:13.445
Hello, beautiful, how are you?

05:13.479 --> 05:15.180
Oh, my goodness.

05:15.214 --> 05:16.415
This is crazy.

05:16.449 --> 05:18.417
- Why is everyone looking at me?
- [all laughing]

05:18.451 --> 05:20.485
Yeah, it's very different,
right?

05:20.520 --> 05:22.554
Very different.
This is very unusual.

05:22.588 --> 05:24.323
So, tell me
who you brought with you?

05:24.357 --> 05:27.225
So, first we have my mom.
This is Mary.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.161
Hi, Randy, great to see you.

05:29.195 --> 05:30.529
Then we have Brittany.

05:30.563 --> 05:33.432
She's one of my maids of honor.

05:33.466 --> 05:36.501
And then we got a fan
in the house today.

05:36.536 --> 05:38.303
Aunt Theresa.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.271
[kisses]

05:39.305 --> 05:41.606
I've watched you
for years, Randy.

05:41.641 --> 05:43.742
Let me tell you.
She is taking care of me.

05:43.776 --> 05:46.244
So today,
we're gonna take care of her.

05:46.279 --> 05:47.312
Oh, my gosh. I can't wait.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.814
Okay, well, talk to you soon.

05:48.848 --> 05:51.016
<i>- Okay, my love. Bye-bye.</i>
- Bye.

05:51.517 --> 05:52.651
[woman speaking]

05:52.685 --> 05:53.852
[Daniela] Oh, boy.

05:53.886 --> 05:55.554
- [man] You get a full treatment now.
- [Daniela] I know!

05:55.588 --> 05:57.055
[man] Please have a seat.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.757
So, I sit and then
you bring it back?

05:58.791 --> 06:02.427
No, you've seen this like,
literally, how many times?

06:02.462 --> 06:04.763
Oh, my gosh. Hundreds of times.

06:04.797 --> 06:06.431
- [Norma] Does it feel weird?
- Yes.

06:06.466 --> 06:08.467
It feels weird.
Why are you laughing?

06:08.501 --> 06:09.601
[laughing]

06:09.635 --> 06:12.804
I've been working with Randy
for almost four years.

06:12.839 --> 06:15.374
Let me see
how many brides we have today.

06:15.408 --> 06:16.975
I think they said,
83 this morning.

06:17.844 --> 06:21.646
I'm fortunate enough
to roam the floors

06:21.681 --> 06:22.881
<i>from time to time
at Kleinfeld's.</i>

06:22.915 --> 06:24.683
<i>So, I think I know
what I'm looking for.</i>

06:24.717 --> 06:27.452
But my crew is going to be,

06:27.487 --> 06:30.722
hopefully, looking out for
my best interests too.

06:30.757 --> 06:32.290
[man] That's my favorite one.

06:32.325 --> 06:34.192
- I really like this one.
- [man] Yeah.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.594
You see it has like...

06:35.628 --> 06:37.496
- You don't like the back?
- I love the back.

06:37.530 --> 06:38.430
Oh, okay.

06:38.464 --> 06:39.965
Matt thinks,
he's picking out the dress.

06:39.999 --> 06:40.799
[Matt] That's right.

06:40.833 --> 06:43.602
I've never come
to the store before,

06:43.636 --> 06:45.404
unless it was a work day.

06:45.471 --> 06:50.208
So, this feels very exciting
and very different.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.078
But man, is this heavy?

06:54.414 --> 06:55.447
<i>Hey, there.</i>

06:55.481 --> 06:56.415
[gasps]

06:56.449 --> 06:58.517
Oh, God. I dropped
the dress too!

06:58.551 --> 06:59.751
<i>What are you doing?</i>

06:59.786 --> 07:01.987
-Don't tell Amber. These were here already.
-[Randy chuckles]

07:02.655 --> 07:03.789
You're like our typical bride.

07:03.823 --> 07:05.590
<i>- Grabbing dresses.</i>
- [Daniela] I know.

07:05.625 --> 07:07.826
- Daniela.
- Oh, my gosh!

07:07.860 --> 07:09.828
- Are you so excited?
- Oh, my gosh, I'm so excited.

07:09.862 --> 07:12.497
I don't wanna overstep.
But I did already,

07:12.532 --> 07:14.833
- bring in some dresses.
- You did.

07:15.234 --> 07:16.401
Hello, Amber.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.970
Randy's here already. Randy, hi.

07:19.005 --> 07:21.473
<i>Let me see what you chose,
Daniela. I wanna see.</i>

07:21.507 --> 07:23.575
All pretty, like, long and lean.

07:23.609 --> 07:25.911
- [Amber] Okay.
- As I hope to be on my wedding day.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.747
<i>Now, this one's kind of
outside the box. Tell me.</i>

07:28.781 --> 07:34.553
It has a really fun
cape train in the back.

07:34.587 --> 07:35.987
[Randy]
<i>That's like a Watteau train.</i>

07:36.022 --> 07:38.590
[Amber] I have to say, I'm super-impressed
with the ones that she picked.

07:38.624 --> 07:39.791
Like, I feel good about them.

07:39.826 --> 07:42.461
- [Randy]<i> Yeah.</i>
- It makes me feel a lot better.

07:42.495 --> 07:45.864
<i>In all the time that you spent
working with me,</i>

07:45.898 --> 07:48.533
I don't ever remember you,
trying on a dress.

07:48.568 --> 07:49.668
Have you ever tried on a dress?

07:49.702 --> 07:51.937
Definitely tried on
a crown before.

07:51.971 --> 07:53.839
- Because how could you resist?
- [Amber] Exactly.

07:53.873 --> 07:54.773
[laughing]

07:54.807 --> 07:56.875
But the dresses,
this will be my first time.

07:56.909 --> 08:00.445
<i>Has Bob given you any idea of
what he wants to see you in?</i>

08:00.480 --> 08:05.484
He's forbidden to know anything
about today until our wedding day.

08:05.518 --> 08:07.786
So, no hints of what he wants.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.354
And I'm not gonna
drop a hint back.

08:09.388 --> 08:11.022
[Daniela]<i> We've been</i>
<i>together for seven years.</i>

08:11.057 --> 08:16.127
<i>But I feel like I've known since year
one that we were going to get married.</i>

08:19.632 --> 08:21.333
Yeah, I was like, hello?

08:21.367 --> 08:23.401
When are things happening here?

08:23.436 --> 08:27.539
<i>We had planned to
get a dog together.</i>

08:27.573 --> 08:29.608
<i>So, we picked him up.</i>

08:29.642 --> 08:31.843
<i>And took him to the beach.</i>

08:31.878 --> 08:35.380
And Bob got down on one knee
and he proposed.

08:35.414 --> 08:36.815
<i>We committed to a dog together</i>

08:36.849 --> 08:38.783
before we committed
to life together.

08:38.818 --> 08:42.454
<i>I miss you. I wish I could
be there in person.</i>

08:42.488 --> 08:45.323
- I know. I'm gonna trust the process today.
- Exactly.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.858
I'm gonna go meet
with your entourage,

08:46.893 --> 08:48.827
<i>while you're trying
on your first dress, okay?</i>

08:48.861 --> 08:49.861
[laughing]

08:49.896 --> 08:52.964
Last night, I was like,
"Mom, you have to behave,

08:52.999 --> 08:54.533
like, you're meeting
my boss, basically."

08:54.567 --> 08:55.967
Hi, Randy.

08:56.002 --> 09:01.006
So, I'm definitely a little bit nervous
about having them here today.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.441
And I hope that everyone
is on their best behavior.

09:03.476 --> 09:04.643
<i>How you doing, Mom?</i>

09:04.677 --> 09:07.812
Okay. Nervous. I don't
know what she's trying on first.

09:07.847 --> 09:11.683
I have to say, I'm a little
surprised at what she's chosen,

09:11.717 --> 09:14.052
<i>because, first of all,
they're really, really simple.</i>

09:14.086 --> 09:16.621
I don't know, maybe, because
I've only seen her in black,

09:16.656 --> 09:17.956
I didn't know what to expect.

09:17.990 --> 09:20.425
I mean, I never know,
what Daniela's gonna pick.

09:20.459 --> 09:22.527
<i>But she may surprise us today.</i>

09:22.562 --> 09:24.930
This is pretty.
I really like this.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.431
It's like, slinky.

09:26.465 --> 09:27.933
<i>Yeah, this is stunning.</i>

09:27.967 --> 09:32.437
Normally, if I walked into a room
and a bride already had dresses pulled,

09:32.471 --> 09:34.539
I would be, like,
really concerned.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.741
<i>But I trust Daniela because
she works with Randy</i>

09:36.776 --> 09:39.611
and it's a little bit of pressure,
but also really special.

09:39.645 --> 09:41.146
<i>Because Daniela's usually
behind the scenes.</i>

09:41.180 --> 09:46.084
And now, today is her day, to be
front and center, and it's all about her.

09:46.118 --> 09:48.386
I'm so excited to see.
Oh, my gosh, she's coming.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.589
- [Mary] She's coming.
- [Theresa] Oh, wow.

09:50.623 --> 09:52.290
- Wow.
- Oh, my goodness.

09:52.325 --> 09:53.992
[Brittany] Oh, my gosh.

09:54.393 --> 09:55.894
Hi, everybody.

09:55.928 --> 09:56.861
[all] Hi!

09:56.896 --> 09:59.364
- I'm Amber, nice to meet you.
- How are you?

09:59.398 --> 10:00.699
[Amber] So, what do we think?

10:00.733 --> 10:03.301
[Daniela]
<i>It feels really good on.</i>

10:03.336 --> 10:05.670
I feel so comfortable in it.

10:05.705 --> 10:07.606
<i>The fabric feels like butter.</i>

10:07.640 --> 10:09.374
- Look how gorgeous this is.
- Yeah, beautiful.

10:09.408 --> 10:10.442
That's amazing.

10:10.476 --> 10:11.610
[Theresa] Wow...

10:11.644 --> 10:13.612
It's simple but you have a
little bit of detail up here.

10:13.646 --> 10:15.213
It flows beautifully.

10:15.881 --> 10:16.915
[Randy]<i> Can I say something?</i>

10:16.949 --> 10:21.920
I usually don't, but,
I'm not feeling this at all.

10:22.221 --> 10:23.388
[gasps]

10:23.422 --> 10:25.223
[all] Wow!

10:25.257 --> 10:28.059
Honesty. Okay, we need that.

10:28.094 --> 10:31.863
First of all, I'm a little surprised
that you went for the Watteau train

10:31.897 --> 10:33.798
<i>then you're not gonna be
able to wear a veil.</i>

10:33.833 --> 10:36.768
And I just think a veil is so
beautiful for a bride to wear.

10:36.802 --> 10:40.271
<i>I'm not a huge fan
of the charmeuse.</i>

10:40.306 --> 10:42.040
<i>Because it's so silky and shiny</i>

10:42.074 --> 10:47.746
that it shows every little bump and
bulge and I don't like anything about it.

10:47.780 --> 10:48.947
[laughing]

10:48.981 --> 10:54.819
I've never seen this brutally
honest side of Randy before.

10:54.854 --> 10:57.555
<i>I would like to think that
it's a sign of endearment.</i>

10:57.590 --> 11:01.826
<i>But I was not expecting
to get a hard no, so quickly.</i>

11:01.861 --> 11:05.730
I just think you can find something
so much more beautiful than this.

11:05.765 --> 11:09.367
I wasn't ready to cross it off
quite yet, but now, it's off the list.

11:09.402 --> 11:12.671
<i>Well, if you love it...</i>
[stammering]

11:12.705 --> 11:15.573
- [speaks indistinctly]
- [laughing]

11:15.608 --> 11:18.376
I'm taking it off.
Will be right back.

11:18.411 --> 11:21.346
So, Amber,
I have three dresses in mind.

11:21.380 --> 11:23.448
If you have them, Brooklyn.

11:23.482 --> 11:25.383
<i>Berrie or Bailey.</i>

11:25.418 --> 11:26.785
- Okay.
- [Randy]<i> Don't feel pressured.</i>

11:26.819 --> 11:29.020
But those are just some
that I would think,

11:29.055 --> 11:30.588
might look a little bit more
flattering on you.

11:30.623 --> 11:33.425
[Amber]
All righty, we'll be back!

11:33.459 --> 11:37.362
Generally, when you have a
bride that's curvier or fuller-busted,

11:37.396 --> 11:39.664
I put them in a fabric that
has a little more structure

11:39.699 --> 11:41.700
like a Mikado or satin.

11:41.734 --> 11:44.936
But I think she can probably
pull off something softer

11:44.970 --> 11:46.571
maybe a crepe or chiffon even.

11:46.605 --> 11:48.907
- I like it.
- Yeah, I don't...

11:48.941 --> 11:49.808
love that one.

11:49.842 --> 11:52.143
Well, you know what,
she's short-waisted.

11:55.614 --> 11:58.516
She'll definitely listen to Mom
if she doesn't like the dress.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.386
It's all Mikado
from Randy's collection.

12:01.854 --> 12:02.821
What do you think?

12:02.855 --> 12:05.657
[Daniela] Is there
anything else for me to try?

12:05.691 --> 12:07.192
[Amber]
We'll call this one a no.

12:12.531 --> 12:15.433
<i>♪ Nothing can stop me ♪</i>

12:15.468 --> 12:17.435
<i>♪ No, no... ♪</i>

12:17.470 --> 12:20.238
Ry, you're giving me
double chins.

12:20.272 --> 12:21.573
I'm feeling so excited

12:21.607 --> 12:23.842
to find my dream dress.

12:23.876 --> 12:26.111
The perfect dress
for the perfect kid.

12:26.445 --> 12:28.413
[laughing]

12:28.447 --> 12:30.582
Kendall's sleeping.
She didn't hear that.

12:30.616 --> 12:33.551
My youngest daughter
and I were on<i> Dance Moms.</i>

12:33.586 --> 12:36.087
<i>We shot about 200 episodes.</i>

12:36.122 --> 12:37.655
<i>Since then,
the kids have grown up.</i>

12:37.690 --> 12:40.892
<i>Kendall was eight years old,
she's 18 now.</i>

12:40.926 --> 12:44.362
But Kendall's a dancer because
of Ryleigh. She started it all.

12:44.396 --> 12:49.601
I had her in a tutu and tiara
and costumes before we knew it.

12:50.336 --> 12:53.338
- I'm in heaven.
- Oh, my gosh!

12:53.372 --> 12:54.539
Girls, let's shop.

12:54.573 --> 12:56.775
I like illusion.

12:56.809 --> 12:58.276
- I like the fit-to-flare.
- [Jill] Oh!

12:58.310 --> 13:00.145
Am I allowed to take this off?

13:00.913 --> 13:02.413
- [all laughing]
- I'll put it back.

13:02.448 --> 13:03.615
This is Mom's wedding too.

13:03.649 --> 13:05.483
- [Jill] Stop it.
- [chuckles]

13:05.518 --> 13:07.485
Ryleigh has always
been the goody two-shoes.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.455
She always followed the rules,
listened to Mom and Dad.

13:10.489 --> 13:11.790
Yeah, she's the favorite.

13:11.824 --> 13:14.592
- Has always been their favorite.
- Absolutely, yep.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.529
No, I don't have a favorite.
They're all my favorite.

13:18.597 --> 13:21.599
She's just my good kid.
She's not my favorite kid.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.635
- Ryleigh, hi.
- Hi!

13:23.669 --> 13:26.504
I'm Kelsey. I grew up
watching<i> Dance Moms.</i>

13:26.539 --> 13:28.439
And I recognized you guys.

13:28.474 --> 13:31.376
We are so excited
to be here for Ry.

13:31.410 --> 13:32.443
We gotta find her a dress.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.312
A dress or two.

13:34.346 --> 13:36.481
Or two? Oh, no!

13:36.515 --> 13:38.249
What if she wants to do
two looks?

13:38.284 --> 13:39.617
So, I do want two looks.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.387
- Okay.
- Whether it's one dress and an overskirt for the ceremony,

13:42.421 --> 13:43.788
- take it off for the reception.
- Gotcha.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.291
My fiance's changing
his suit jacket.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.493
So, I wanna have
two looks as well.

13:48.527 --> 13:50.728
[Ryleigh]<i> My fiance's name is</i>
<i>Kade McClure.</i>

13:50.763 --> 13:53.531
<i>"He's like a big teddy bear.
He's 6'7".</i>

13:53.566 --> 13:55.366
<i>He's actually a professional
baseball player.</i>

13:55.401 --> 13:57.602
<i>We met at the University
of Louisville.</i>

13:57.636 --> 13:59.804
<i>I was on the dance team,
he was a baseball player.</i>

14:00.906 --> 14:04.475
And to be honest, I didn't
wanna date him at first,

14:04.510 --> 14:06.578
<i>but I let him take me
out to ice cream.</i>

14:06.612 --> 14:11.049
<i>And I, like, accidentally fell in
love with his personality really quick.</i>

14:11.517 --> 14:13.051
Will you marry me?

14:13.385 --> 14:14.352
Yes!

14:16.288 --> 14:18.423
I was completely shocked.

14:18.457 --> 14:19.591
<i>It's my favorite day.</i>

14:19.625 --> 14:22.894
He's really a good guy
and that's what counts.

14:22.928 --> 14:24.762
I have fallen in love
with Martina Liana.

14:24.797 --> 14:28.733
But I'm kind of deciding if I wanna
go the beads and glam and lace route

14:28.767 --> 14:34.806
or something super simple,
chic, all satin, plain.

14:34.840 --> 14:37.275
I will not settle for anything
less than perfection.

14:37.309 --> 14:38.243
Me neither.

14:38.277 --> 14:39.210
[laughing]

14:39.245 --> 14:40.578
She said it. What she said.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.447
I did like this.

14:42.481 --> 14:44.515
- Really pretty.
- It'll look good on your body.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.117
- I like it.
- It'll look good on you.

14:49.255 --> 14:51.456
It's empire waist.

14:51.490 --> 14:53.758
[Ryleigh] This is
a little bit empire.

14:54.293 --> 14:55.393
Yeah, I don't love that.

14:55.427 --> 14:56.694
It cuts too high?

14:56.729 --> 14:59.530
You know, we want something
to show off

14:59.565 --> 15:00.632
- her shape.
- [Kelsey] Okay.

15:00.666 --> 15:03.167
And I'm not sure cause
she is kind of short-waisted.

15:06.505 --> 15:08.406
- [Ryleigh] I do wanna try it.
- Okay.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.208
[Jill speaking]

15:11.477 --> 15:12.944
[laughing]

15:12.978 --> 15:16.447
You guys can look around. I'm going
to take Ryleigh with me to the back.

15:16.482 --> 15:18.383
- Perfect.
- [Kelsey] And we'll be back soon.

15:18.417 --> 15:19.584
All right. See you later.

15:19.618 --> 15:20.618
[Charlotte] I'm so excited.

15:20.653 --> 15:23.588
I think, the poor thing,
I micro-managed her.

15:23.622 --> 15:25.423
My whole life, her whole life...

15:25.457 --> 15:27.825
<i>So, I think she really
does want to please me.</i>

15:27.860 --> 15:30.561
<i>And I think she'll
trust my opinion.</i>

15:30.596 --> 15:32.964
But we'll have to wait
and see on that one.

15:35.301 --> 15:36.534
[Ryleigh] I do like this.

15:36.568 --> 15:39.203
Something about it
is really elegant.

15:39.238 --> 15:40.305
- [Kelsey] Right?
- Yeah.

15:40.339 --> 15:41.239
[Kelsey] And the lace...

15:41.273 --> 15:43.808
But I don't know
if I'm loving this, though.

15:43.842 --> 15:46.811
I saw this dress online
before I came.

15:46.845 --> 15:51.516
<i>I knew I wanted to try it on but I haven't
gotten that, "It's the one" feeling.</i>

15:51.550 --> 15:53.718
I really just wanna know,
the second I put it on,

15:53.752 --> 15:55.687
I wanna know that
this is the dress.

15:55.721 --> 15:57.622
Okay, let's try
something different.

15:57.656 --> 15:59.757
[Charlotte]<i> Ryleigh,</i>
<i>needs my mom's opinion.</i>

15:59.792 --> 16:01.693
<i>And my mom does have
a lot of opinions.</i>

16:01.727 --> 16:04.996
She'll definitely listen to Mom
if she doesn't like the dress.

16:09.401 --> 16:11.469
I was not expecting
Randy to be, like,

16:11.503 --> 16:13.338
a little brutal
on the first dress.

16:13.372 --> 16:14.405
Yeah, I don't think he loved it.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.374
Yeah, seriously, if you
don't like it, I was like--

16:16.408 --> 16:18.176
- Now I don't like it.
- [Norma speaking]

16:19.645 --> 16:23.381
I mean, I don't think
it's "the dress", now.

16:23.415 --> 16:26.217
But I did really love it
when I walked out there.

16:26.251 --> 16:27.285
So, Randy changed your mind?

16:27.319 --> 16:28.419
Totally changed my mind.

16:28.454 --> 16:32.724
I'm rarely that vocal,
but with Daniela, I think,

16:32.758 --> 16:36.327
because she's so special to
me. I'm a little over protective.

16:37.162 --> 16:38.463
I hated the dress.

16:38.497 --> 16:39.731
[all laughing]

16:39.765 --> 16:42.633
Daniela's told me a few things
about working with Randy.

16:42.668 --> 16:45.703
And I think Randy's opinion
means everything to Daniela.

16:45.738 --> 16:48.072
We're crossing that one off.
For sure, then.

16:48.407 --> 16:49.340
Yeah.

16:51.710 --> 16:55.713
Yeah, I was surprised that
Randy didn't like that first dress.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.982
<i>I think he really
just didn't love the fabric.</i>

16:58.017 --> 17:01.419
So, I'm gonna put on something
Mikado from Randy's collection.

17:01.453 --> 17:03.721
It's the Brooklyn dress.
The one that he suggested.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.824
<i>And the thicker fabric might
work better for her. We'll see.</i>

17:07.393 --> 17:08.826
<i>Randy has to be honest.</i>

17:08.861 --> 17:11.596
And Randy knows Daniela.
This is a special case.

17:11.630 --> 17:15.600
This is not, you know, a bride that
Randy has met five minutes ago.

17:15.634 --> 17:17.568
<i>So, if it doesn't feel like her,</i>

17:17.603 --> 17:19.303
let's get rid of the dress.

17:19.338 --> 17:20.571
This is all Mikado.

17:20.606 --> 17:23.107
This piece is
extremely lightweight

17:23.142 --> 17:25.243
- and yummy, the fabric feeling.
- Okay.

17:25.277 --> 17:26.210
What do you think?

17:26.245 --> 17:27.278
I...

17:27.312 --> 17:28.880
- Immediately...
- Mmm-hmm.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.683
- Don't like the belt.
- The belt, yeah.

17:32.718 --> 17:35.019
- Is that detachable?
- Yeah, we can take this off.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.588
-Okay -The only thing is
it has a seam under there.

17:37.623 --> 17:38.923
[Daniela] Okay.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.793
Was there anything
else for me to try?

17:41.827 --> 17:44.328
Yeah. You wanna grab
something else? Yeah? Okay.

17:45.697 --> 17:47.198
[Amber]
We'll call this one a no.

17:47.232 --> 17:48.399
[Daniela] Yeah.

17:48.434 --> 17:50.802
Is it just the belt or is it,
like, also the style of it?

17:50.836 --> 17:53.671
I think, it's the style of it.
It looks...

17:53.705 --> 17:56.607
Like, I know, now we're going
from really slinky...

17:56.642 --> 17:58.776
- Structure.
- ...to really, like, smooth structure.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.578
- Yes. That's what it is.
- Okay. Got it.

18:00.612 --> 18:02.680
So, maybe we'll do
something else.

18:02.714 --> 18:05.349
- Like, in a crepe material. Yeah?
- Yeah.

18:05.384 --> 18:06.517
- Yeah, I think so.
- Yeah, all right.

18:06.552 --> 18:08.453
- So, I'll get rid of this.
- Okay.

18:08.487 --> 18:09.520
Okay, perfect.

18:09.555 --> 18:11.989
I've built up so much
pressure in my mind,

18:12.024 --> 18:14.025
of making sure that I have
the "Say yes" moment.

18:14.059 --> 18:17.528
You know, sometimes brides
come in, and they don't find the dress.

18:17.563 --> 18:19.397
We don't always
have a "Say yes."

18:24.403 --> 18:26.170
[woman speaking]

18:27.506 --> 18:28.539
[Jill] Oh...

18:28.574 --> 18:30.341
It's really dramatic.
I like drama.

18:31.310 --> 18:33.144
You like drama, all right.

18:33.178 --> 18:36.714
Who doesn't like drama? She's
not a drama queen like you guys.

18:36.748 --> 18:39.317
Hey, this will be
a total switch-up.

18:39.351 --> 18:40.852
I feel like
I need to please everyone

18:40.886 --> 18:42.620
and have everyone
love the same dress.

18:42.654 --> 18:44.922
[Jill]<i> You can't please</i>
<i>everyone. You please you.</i>

18:44.957 --> 18:47.625
But I think you need
honest opinions.

18:47.659 --> 18:49.927
- Yeah.
- And I'm here to give it.

18:50.929 --> 18:54.866
I never though I would do
this kind of neckline.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.935
- The V? Yeah, the V is great.
- [Ryleigh] But I love it.

18:58.604 --> 19:00.505
- Can I see the back?
- Yeah.

19:00.539 --> 19:02.807
Oh, my gosh, I love the bow!

19:02.841 --> 19:06.644
-I mean, I wanna show them. I wanna get their thoughts.
-[Kelsey] Okay, me too.

19:06.678 --> 19:10.348
[Ryleigh]<i> This dress is really</i>
<i>clean, simple and classic.</i>

19:10.382 --> 19:11.849
I'm obsessed with the bow.

19:11.884 --> 19:14.719
I think, it's so different
and it's so me.

19:14.753 --> 19:17.822
How do you feel about
an overskirt for the ceremony,

19:17.856 --> 19:19.624
take it off,
put the bow on for reception?

19:19.658 --> 19:20.858
[Kelsey] You could do that.

19:20.893 --> 19:24.028
The one thing about this dress
is, I wanna try for two looks.

19:24.062 --> 19:27.031
<i>So Kelsey's grabbing an
overskirt right now, for me to try on,</i>

19:27.065 --> 19:30.301
<i>to have two completely different
looks with the same dress.</i>

19:30.335 --> 19:31.669
Maybe I cover the bow,

19:31.703 --> 19:33.704
- and then we take it off and the bow is already on.
- [Ryleigh] Okay.

19:33.739 --> 19:35.673
[Kelsey] And you're,
like, surprised again.

19:35.707 --> 19:40.578
I'm hoping that my family loves
it. I don't know what they'll think.

19:40.612 --> 19:43.114
<i>But, I guess, let's just
go find out.</i> [chuckles]

19:43.549 --> 19:44.982
Here she comes.

19:45.017 --> 19:45.483
[gasping]

19:45.517 --> 19:46.584
Oh, that is pretty.

19:46.618 --> 19:48.886
I like that reaction.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.255
[Kendall] That is beautiful.

19:52.090 --> 19:53.291
Oh, honey.

19:59.464 --> 20:00.665
I feel like a princess.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.833
[all] You look like one.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.635
We were looking at crowns,
earlier today.

20:04.670 --> 20:08.706
Trust me, Mom has already said
she's wearing my crown on the day.

20:08.740 --> 20:10.374
[Jill] She doesn't want a crown.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.844
I'm thinking, so I don't
love this band with this skirt.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.980
[Charlotte] Could you get
a little bit of gems

20:16.014 --> 20:19.150
- in that area?
- [Kelsey] You could do a belt if you wanted to.

20:19.184 --> 20:19.850
Yeah.

20:20.152 --> 20:21.752
Oh, yeah.

20:21.787 --> 20:25.289
[Kelsey] If she wants the belt for the
whole night, we can sew it into the dress.

20:25.324 --> 20:26.624
[Ryleigh] I love it. I do.

20:26.658 --> 20:28.326
I, like, still have butterflies.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.494
I don't know. I love this.

20:30.529 --> 20:33.598
I'm feeling absolutely
on cloud nine.

20:33.632 --> 20:38.102
<i>Every single thing about this
dress, is what I dreamed of.</i>

20:42.507 --> 20:44.208
Oh, yike...

20:45.277 --> 20:46.244
Hmm...

20:46.278 --> 20:48.112
[Jill] Really it just...

20:48.146 --> 20:50.548
It's almost like sleeves.
It'll just look like sleeves.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.350
I know what gloves look like.

20:52.384 --> 20:55.297
Maybe for the reception, though.
Maybe not walking down the aisle.

20:55.321 --> 20:57.221
Oh...

20:57.256 --> 20:58.656
We have a little surprise.

20:58.690 --> 21:01.959
Because there's a little something
extra you guys haven't seen yet.

21:03.495 --> 21:05.997
- This.
- [all cheering]

21:06.031 --> 21:06.764
A bow!

21:06.798 --> 21:08.699
[Kendall] Oh, my goodness.
Shut up!

21:08.734 --> 21:11.135
- What do you guys think of the bow?
- [all] Wow!

21:11.503 --> 21:12.937
Oh, my God.

21:12.971 --> 21:16.507
[Kelsey] So, she has buttons that
come all the way down the train.

21:16.541 --> 21:18.876
[Kendall] This is so precious.

21:18.910 --> 21:23.381
- [Kelsey] A bow with the streamers.
- Are you crying?

21:23.415 --> 21:25.783
Oh, my gosh!
You're gonna make me cry.

21:25.817 --> 21:28.252
- You like it?
- Now you're making me cry.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.388
Guys, oh, my God!

21:30.422 --> 21:32.290
I love this reaction.

21:32.324 --> 21:34.959
It's so...

21:34.993 --> 21:38.362
I don't know. I've never seen a
dress with a bow in the back like this.

21:38.397 --> 21:40.564
I love it. I love it so much.

21:40.599 --> 21:41.799
I saw you start crying,
so I started crying.

21:41.833 --> 21:43.434
<i>- But that's when you know.</i>
- [Charlotte]<i> Yeah.</i>

21:43.468 --> 21:46.270
[Kendall]<i> This dress,</i>
<i>it just had more to it.</i>

21:46.305 --> 21:47.672
[Charlotte]<i> The wow factor,</i>

21:47.706 --> 21:49.340
<i>- everything that she could want.</i>
- [Kendall]<i> The little sparkle.</i>

21:49.374 --> 21:50.574
Yeah. I love it.

21:50.609 --> 21:53.577
Do you think we could try it
with the skirt and a veil?

21:53.612 --> 21:55.946
- [Kelsey] For sure.
- Just to get the full effect.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.516
Are you ready for that?
Get ready for the waterworks.

21:58.550 --> 21:59.517
[Ryleigh] I think
I wanna see it.

21:59.551 --> 22:00.518
[Kelsey] Perfect.

22:00.552 --> 22:02.353
Yeah, no veil yet.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.256
No.

22:06.892 --> 22:10.061
[Ryleigh]<i> My mom is not</i>
<i>completely sold on it,</i>

22:10.095 --> 22:12.863
and my heart drops, because
I don't think I can say yes

22:12.898 --> 22:17.101
<i>to a dress knowing that she
doesn't completely love it.</i>

22:18.603 --> 22:19.704
You wanna try on more,
don't you?

22:19.738 --> 22:21.439
- Let Ryleigh speak...
- [Ryleigh] I mean, yeah,

22:21.473 --> 22:22.606
I definitely... I love this one,

22:22.641 --> 22:24.375
but we can try on more
to compare.

22:25.110 --> 22:26.077
Yeah.

22:26.111 --> 22:28.746
I want Ryleigh to get around
my mom's opinions.

22:28.780 --> 22:32.283
<i>- That's kind of the big thing that we're here to do.</i>
- [Kendall]<i> Right.</i>

22:32.317 --> 22:33.417
<i>She needs two of us</i>

22:33.452 --> 22:35.152
<i>- compared to the one.</i>
- [Charlotte]<i> Yeah.</i>

22:37.322 --> 22:37.988
[Ryleigh] Mom?

22:38.824 --> 22:41.592
- What?
- It cuts right here a little.

22:41.626 --> 22:43.627
[Kelsey] There is petticoat
underneath.

22:43.662 --> 22:47.598
We can remove some of this
to make the flare softer.

22:47.632 --> 22:49.700
I think Ryleigh
is curvy as it is,

22:49.735 --> 22:53.070
and I think a mermaid dress kind
of adds to some of those curves,

22:53.105 --> 22:56.741
<i>and I would hate if some day she
looked back ten years from now,</i>

22:56.775 --> 23:00.711
at the pictures, and thought,
"Oh, gosh, Mom, my thighs."

23:00.746 --> 23:03.414
You're making her
rethink the dress.

23:03.448 --> 23:04.682
In the end, it's what you want.

23:04.716 --> 23:06.884
Yeah, not what Mom wants.

23:06.918 --> 23:09.353
I know, honey,
but Mom knows best.

23:09.388 --> 23:10.454
Mmm-hmm.

23:10.488 --> 23:11.355
What do I say every day?

23:11.390 --> 23:12.890
<i>Put your best foot forward.</i>

23:12.924 --> 23:17.995
You know? And I know what your best
is gonna be, and I know when we see it.

23:19.131 --> 23:20.030
Next.

23:20.766 --> 23:22.032
Yeah.

23:22.067 --> 23:25.436
I think she does love it. And
she's worried about your opinion.

23:25.470 --> 23:26.604
- All right.
- So just ease up.

23:26.638 --> 23:28.305
- Okay, point taken.
- Okay.

23:30.275 --> 23:31.976
It's a little booby.

23:32.010 --> 23:33.544
- [Ryleigh] What do you mean?
- [Charlotte] No, it's not.

23:33.578 --> 23:34.745
It's not booby at all.

23:34.780 --> 23:37.248
- So you're ready to try it on?
- Yes.

23:37.282 --> 23:38.482
- So nervous.
- I know.

23:38.517 --> 23:39.950
Let me tell you something,
I'm nervous, too.

23:39.985 --> 23:41.786
[Christen]
<i>Today, I'm here at Kleinfeld,</i>

23:41.820 --> 23:44.822
to try on my wedding dress
for the very first time.

23:44.856 --> 23:48.225
This could go really good,
or it could be horrific.

23:48.527 --> 23:49.894
<i>So...</i>

23:50.262 --> 23:51.195
<i>We'll see.</i>

23:57.869 --> 24:01.439
I do like that both Charlotte and
Kendall are on board with this dress.

24:01.473 --> 24:04.575
But my mom's opinion means
a lot to me.

24:04.609 --> 24:06.544
So, I definitely wanna
make her happy,

24:06.578 --> 24:08.579
and leave here with a dress
I know she loves

24:08.613 --> 24:09.780
as much as I do.

24:09.815 --> 24:11.782
She was okay
with the mermaid cut.

24:11.817 --> 24:14.385
You're the one who added
some input on that.

24:14.419 --> 24:15.719
You're making her double think.

24:15.754 --> 24:17.655
If she loves it, I will love it.

24:17.689 --> 24:19.657
I just want her to be happy,

24:19.691 --> 24:22.693
- because, originally, she said no mermaid dress.
- But...

24:22.727 --> 24:24.628
And here she is
in a mermaid dress.

24:24.663 --> 24:25.529
She wants you to be happy.

24:25.564 --> 24:28.098
I... Well, I wanna
be happy, too.

24:28.133 --> 24:28.732
I know.

24:28.767 --> 24:30.334
From here it's kinda tricky

24:30.368 --> 24:33.838
because we're already eliminating anything
that's too much of a mermaid flare.

24:33.872 --> 24:37.908
<i>Because Ryleigh's mom, Jill,
does not love the trumpet.</i>

24:37.943 --> 24:41.412
So that's eliminating a lot
of fitted dresses already.

24:41.446 --> 24:42.646
I think this is a good one.

24:42.681 --> 24:43.681
It's crepe.

24:43.715 --> 24:46.016
It's a different fabric
which we haven't tried.

24:46.051 --> 24:48.752
And this is the only fabric
that really is gonna fall straight.

24:48.787 --> 24:50.521
So if her mom hates the trumpet,

24:50.555 --> 24:53.023
this is the only other
fabric option.

24:53.525 --> 24:54.658
Okay, Ryleigh, so...

24:54.693 --> 24:56.427
- Hi!
- I'll show you what I pulled.

24:56.461 --> 24:58.028
Okay.

24:58.063 --> 25:00.397
- Anything that's not going to have the trumpet...
- Okay.

25:00.432 --> 25:02.633
...is going to be crepe.

25:02.667 --> 25:06.637
This is the only other fabric that's not to
give you so much drama at the bottom.

25:06.671 --> 25:10.875
My mom likes illusions. I think
she's gonna like this one a lot.

25:10.909 --> 25:15.646
<i>It would be so hard for me to say
yes to a dress that my mom didn't love,</i>

25:15.680 --> 25:18.883
<i>because I just trust
my mom's opinion so much.</i>

25:18.917 --> 25:24.188
I didn't think I was gonna love
this one, but I actually... I like it.

25:29.661 --> 25:30.561
What do you think?

25:30.595 --> 25:33.264
Oh, yeah... No.

25:33.298 --> 25:34.431
[laughing]

25:34.466 --> 25:35.766
[speaking indistinctly]

25:35.800 --> 25:39.603
[Ryleigh] Wait, so, Mom, we wanna
tell you why we put this dress on.

25:39.638 --> 25:42.640
This material is really
the only one that has

25:42.674 --> 25:44.475
that straight down style
that you like.

25:44.509 --> 25:46.377
I do like that.

25:46.411 --> 25:47.611
And then it has the illusion.

25:47.646 --> 25:50.614
[Jill] I do like that, too.
Isn't that funny?

25:50.649 --> 25:52.683
It's a little... booby.

25:52.717 --> 25:55.119
No, it's not.
It's not booby at all.

25:55.153 --> 25:59.023
[Jill] I don't think this one does what
the other one did for your shape, Ry-Ry.

25:59.057 --> 26:01.759
- [Ryleigh] Are you just saying that?
- [Jill] No!

26:01.793 --> 26:03.694
I feel like you don't wanna
hurt my feelings.

26:03.728 --> 26:05.496
- No, I...
- She'll speak her mind.

26:05.530 --> 26:06.697
[Jill] I...

26:08.033 --> 26:11.502
I wanna take a picture of you in
it, and I wanna... The other one.

26:11.536 --> 26:12.536
Why? To see what
it would photograph?

26:12.571 --> 26:14.371
I wanna see
if it photographs well,

26:14.406 --> 26:15.839
and doesn't make you too curvy,

26:15.874 --> 26:18.475
because it kinda comes around
right here.

26:18.510 --> 26:20.010
Mmm-hmm.

26:20.679 --> 26:23.013
I think it'll photograph well.

26:23.548 --> 26:24.915
I wanna put it on again.

26:24.950 --> 26:26.550
- [Kelsey] I think you should see it again.
- [Ryleigh] Let's do that.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.719
I need you 100% on board.

26:28.753 --> 26:31.755
- I will be honest.
- [Kendall] I think she wants you to change your answer.

26:31.790 --> 26:33.757
No, honey, she knows me
better than that.

26:33.792 --> 26:36.393
Maybe put on gloves
to make her happy.

26:36.428 --> 26:37.494
[Kelsey]
Yeah, you did want the gloves.

26:37.529 --> 26:39.897
Would that sell it for you?

26:39.931 --> 26:43.601
If I put this dress back on, and
my mom is still not sold on it,

26:43.635 --> 26:46.036
<i>I honestly don't know
what I'll do.</i>

26:56.581 --> 26:58.015
I'm nervous.

27:00.352 --> 27:02.353
I am freaking out.

27:02.387 --> 27:05.322
I am coming to try on
my wedding dress

27:05.357 --> 27:06.624
for the very first time.

27:06.658 --> 27:09.293
I bought it
on a virtual appointment.

27:09.327 --> 27:11.328
And I've never
seen it in person.

27:11.363 --> 27:13.330
Christen!

27:13.365 --> 27:14.698
- Hi!
- Hello, how are you?

27:14.733 --> 27:17.267
- So good to see you.
- You too!

27:17.302 --> 27:21.472
I've been trying to come to
Kleinfeld's since August of 2020.

27:21.506 --> 27:23.674
<i>And just with COVID
and the travel restrictions,</i>

27:23.708 --> 27:25.676
the appointments people
told me, you know,

27:25.710 --> 27:27.745
"Hey, you know you could
do a virtual appointment,"

27:27.779 --> 27:31.548
if I really wanted to buy my dress
at Kleinfeld's, which was the dream.

27:31.583 --> 27:33.584
So, I just went ahead
and did it.

27:33.618 --> 27:38.255
You're the first
to have a virtual appointment,

27:38.289 --> 27:40.658
and come in and put it on.

27:40.692 --> 27:42.493
The virtual was really amazing.

27:42.527 --> 27:44.762
<i>Lisa pulled out
a Stella York dress</i>

27:44.796 --> 27:47.765
<i>She had one of the employees
try on the dress for me.</i>

27:47.799 --> 27:50.668
Then I was just like,
"This is the dress. I love it."

27:50.702 --> 27:54.638
<i>So today, I see it for the
very first time, and try it on.</i>

27:54.673 --> 27:56.540
And hopefully, it's amazing.

27:56.574 --> 27:59.810
And my wedding is in six
weeks. So I'm kinda freaking out.

27:59.844 --> 28:02.379
- So you're ready to try it on?
- [Christen] Yes.

28:02.414 --> 28:03.647
- So nervous.
- I know.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.516
Let me tell you something,
I'm nervous, too.

28:05.550 --> 28:06.684
In order to get the dress today,

28:06.718 --> 28:09.186
I could only be in the state
of New York for 24 hours.

28:09.220 --> 28:14.391
<i>So, if I don't love it, we're gonna be
scrambling and it's gonna be terrible.</i>

28:14.426 --> 28:16.493
Maybe this was not
a good decision.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.562
- Now that we're meeting face to face, in person.
- Yes.

28:18.596 --> 28:20.297
What about the fiance?
Tell me about him.

28:21.633 --> 28:23.467
[Christen]<i> My fiance's name</i>
<i>is Patrick.</i>

28:23.501 --> 28:25.536
<i>And we met on a dating app.</i>

28:25.570 --> 28:27.471
<i>And I know it's crazy,
but we were both</i>

28:27.505 --> 28:30.741
<i>each other's first,
and only online dates.</i>

28:30.775 --> 28:31.775
<i>He's just...
He's the whole package,</i>

28:31.810 --> 28:34.244
and I'm just excited
to be married to him.

28:34.579 --> 28:35.679
[chuckles]

28:35.714 --> 28:37.981
Excited to see kinda
what style she picks,

28:38.016 --> 28:40.684
whether it's the bigger one,
or one of those tighter ones.

28:41.786 --> 28:44.655
But I know she's gonna
look beautiful in everything.

28:44.689 --> 28:49.426
So, I keep having dreams that
I'm naked on my wedding day.

28:49.461 --> 28:51.729
And I see everyone's face,
and they're mortified.

28:51.763 --> 28:55.132
And I'm looking at my fiance
Patrick's face and he's like...

28:56.468 --> 28:57.701
<i>Shocked and so embarrassed.</i>

28:57.736 --> 29:00.003
And so, I'm hopeful
that it's perfect,

29:00.038 --> 29:04.174
and I don't ever have any naked
wedding dreams anymore. [chuckles]

29:04.576 --> 29:05.509
Are you ready?

29:05.543 --> 29:07.244
No. [chuckles]

29:08.747 --> 29:12.416
This could go really good,
or it could be horrific.

29:12.450 --> 29:15.018
So... We'll see.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.957
Is that what it looks like?
Oh, no.

29:30.435 --> 29:32.703
She's Randy Fenoli's
assistant at Kleinfeld's.

29:32.737 --> 29:34.538
We have to find her something.

29:34.572 --> 29:37.775
<i>She wants something clean,
kind of classic,</i>

29:37.809 --> 29:41.512
but with a little bit of
fashionable take to the gown.

29:41.546 --> 29:44.648
<i>Good news is, there's a dress
in the room that I'm really excited</i>

29:44.682 --> 29:46.683
to show her. And if that
doesn't work, then we'll have to

29:46.718 --> 29:49.052
go back to the drawing board.

29:50.255 --> 29:51.421
My God.

29:52.524 --> 29:53.991
Oh, my God.

29:54.559 --> 29:56.393
Look at that smile, yeah.

29:56.427 --> 29:57.661
- Yeah.
- How you feeling?

29:57.695 --> 29:58.595
I feel great.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.364
- You feel great?
- Yeah, I feel really great.

30:03.401 --> 30:05.569
[Amber] It's... I know.

30:05.603 --> 30:07.538
- It's modern, it's sexy.
- Yeah.

30:07.572 --> 30:10.307
- Like, your whole energy in this one...
- Mmm-hmm.

30:10.341 --> 30:11.375
Is different.

30:17.415 --> 30:18.382
Strut.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.819
- [sniffles]
- Tell me how you're feeling.

30:21.853 --> 30:23.554
I'm not gonna cry, yeah? [sobs]

30:23.588 --> 30:26.790
I finally feel beautiful
in this dress.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.526
- I love this so much.
- I love it.

30:29.561 --> 30:31.762
[Daniela] <i>I've heard
brides talk about it before,</i>

30:31.796 --> 30:34.064
they just know
when it's the right dress.

30:34.098 --> 30:37.267
And I think I'm finally
at that moment.

30:37.302 --> 30:38.569
All right, she's coming out.

30:38.603 --> 30:40.070
Oh, my gosh.

30:54.452 --> 30:56.153
[all exclaiming in surprise]

30:57.255 --> 31:00.090
This is absolutely stunning.

31:00.558 --> 31:01.892
- Amazing.
- Yeah.

31:01.926 --> 31:05.429
[Daniela] I feel great.
I feel really, really good.

31:05.463 --> 31:08.632
Feel like I have,
like, a waist, I... My...

31:08.666 --> 31:10.634
Chest is a little bit out,
sorry, guys,

31:10.668 --> 31:12.669
Yes, a wee, a wee bit.

31:12.704 --> 31:14.638
We can close it up
a little, but...

31:14.672 --> 31:15.739
[Amber] But it's so balanced.

31:15.773 --> 31:17.507
Like the front is a little open,

31:17.542 --> 31:20.477
but because her back is
closed, and the long sleeves,

31:20.511 --> 31:22.579
it's not overly sexy.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.448
- Yeah.
- What a big difference when you came out

31:24.482 --> 31:25.849
- in this versus the other one.
- Yeah.

31:26.517 --> 31:27.718
So, Randy, what do you think?

31:27.752 --> 31:30.387
This is what
I've been waiting for!

31:31.856 --> 31:37.294
You... look... gorgeous.
I love this dress on you.

31:37.328 --> 31:38.161
[sighs in relief]

31:38.696 --> 31:40.631
<i>I love the neckline,</i>

31:40.665 --> 31:43.533
<i>I love the shoulder pads,
I love the sleeves,</i>

31:43.568 --> 31:45.469
<i>I love what it's doing
for your waist,</i>

31:45.503 --> 31:48.005
I love the way it slightly
flares out a bit,

31:48.039 --> 31:51.642
I think, which is balancing
your bustline a little bit.

31:51.676 --> 31:54.645
And I love the slit. I love
everything about this dress.

31:54.679 --> 31:57.414
- And I feel like it's you.
- [Daniela] Yeah.

31:59.851 --> 32:02.286
[tearfully] I, like, don't wanna ask
you guys. I feel like I'm gonna cry.

32:02.320 --> 32:03.420
[all chuckling]

32:04.656 --> 32:06.523
Oh, literally,
I'm just so pathetic.

32:06.557 --> 32:08.492
[all laughing]

32:08.526 --> 32:10.494
What do you guys think?
[sniffles]

32:10.528 --> 32:12.229
When you walked inside,
we just knew.

32:12.263 --> 32:13.196
We just knew!

32:13.231 --> 32:14.531
[laughing]

32:14.565 --> 32:15.666
Do you guys like it?

32:15.700 --> 32:17.200
[crew member] Oh, yeah.
I love it.

32:17.835 --> 32:18.936
Like, we're all literally...

32:18.970 --> 32:22.372
Every single person in
this building right now is...

32:22.407 --> 32:23.340
So cute.

32:23.374 --> 32:24.274
Oh...

32:25.710 --> 32:27.377
It's a very special moment.

32:27.412 --> 32:29.613
You're surrounded by people
that love you.

32:29.647 --> 32:32.516
Oh, thanks, guys. Thank you
for all your help today.

32:32.550 --> 32:35.852
On camera, you get to see
the bride and her family

32:35.887 --> 32:39.589
<i>but we're very much a family
behind the scenes as well.</i>

32:39.624 --> 32:43.460
<i>The crew seems to love it,
Randy loves it,</i>

32:43.494 --> 32:47.397
and so does my family,
plunging neckline and all.

32:47.432 --> 32:48.765
- I can't.
- [Daniela] Don't cry.

32:50.168 --> 32:53.303
I hoped and prayed this day would
come, but it's still very emotional,

32:53.338 --> 32:55.839
and I don't know, I'm gonna need
tranquilizers on the wedding day

32:55.873 --> 32:57.240
- or something, so...
- [all chuckling]

32:57.275 --> 33:01.411
So, Daniela, do you feel like you
are ready to see a veil with this?

33:02.513 --> 33:03.480
Yeah, I think so.

33:03.514 --> 33:05.615
Maybe something
with a ribbon edge.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.451
[Mary] Yeah. Beautiful.

33:07.485 --> 33:08.385
Beautiful.

33:08.419 --> 33:09.987
[all] Aw!

33:10.355 --> 33:11.655
This is it.

33:11.689 --> 33:16.126
I absolutely cried watching
other brides in their appointments.

33:16.160 --> 33:21.698
<i>Especially, that veil moment, I
think, always gets me very emotional.</i>

33:21.733 --> 33:25.435
<i>But this time,
I just feel relief.</i>

33:25.470 --> 33:28.472
I've found the dress,
I feels so good.

33:28.506 --> 33:30.540
I'm ready to sign off on this
if you are.

33:30.575 --> 33:32.442
Oh, my gosh, I think I'm ready.

33:32.477 --> 33:33.643
Should we ask
the question, Amber?

33:33.678 --> 33:36.213
I think we should.
I'm so excited.

33:36.247 --> 33:36.947
[all] Daniela...

33:37.782 --> 33:41.051
Are you saying,
"Yes, to the dress?"

33:41.085 --> 33:41.518
Yes!

33:41.552 --> 33:43.253
[all cheering]

33:45.757 --> 33:47.924
[Daniela]<i> I can't imagine</i>
<i>a better experience.</i>

33:47.959 --> 33:52.329
I got to come to work, but
I didn't have to work today.

33:52.363 --> 33:54.698
<i>I got to pick out
a wedding dress,</i>

33:54.732 --> 33:56.366
<i>I mean, it was
a really beautiful day</i>

33:56.401 --> 33:59.403
being able to marry my work,
and my family.

34:05.676 --> 34:07.310
- [Lisa] Are you ready?
- No. [chuckles]

34:09.514 --> 34:11.615
Is that what it looks like?
Oh, no!

34:11.649 --> 34:14.117
[Lisa] There's another layer,
don't worry.

34:14.152 --> 34:14.885
[laughing]

34:15.453 --> 34:16.586
You're freaking me out.

34:16.621 --> 34:18.855
[Lisa laughing]
You're freaking me out.

34:19.791 --> 34:20.791
Just with COVID
and the travel restrictions,

34:20.825 --> 34:22.492
<i>in order to get the dress today,</i>

34:22.527 --> 34:25.529
I could only be in the state
of New York for 24 hours.

34:25.563 --> 34:29.299
So... If I hate the dress, um...

34:29.333 --> 34:31.701
[clicks tongue] That's scary.

34:31.736 --> 34:33.303
I'm like... [exhales deeply]

34:34.772 --> 34:37.107
- [gasps]
- [Lisa] Look at that.

34:37.542 --> 34:39.042
Oh, my gosh.

34:39.577 --> 34:40.444
So pretty.

34:40.478 --> 34:42.579
Let's just hope
it looks as perfect on.

34:42.613 --> 34:44.614
Remember, this is only the
first time you're putting it on.

34:44.649 --> 34:47.117
It hasn't been customized
to your body yet.

34:47.151 --> 34:48.385
- Okay.
- Okay?

34:48.419 --> 34:53.390
If everything that I envisioned
after our virtual appointment

34:53.424 --> 34:54.758
isn't what it looks like on me,

34:54.792 --> 34:58.929
I'm just gonna fall apart.
I don't know.

34:58.963 --> 35:02.399
[Christen's mom] <i>I am concerned.
She did her virtual appointment,</i>

35:02.433 --> 35:05.202
and I don't think I realized

35:05.236 --> 35:07.804
<i>that she was gonna just pick
out a dress and get it.</i> [chuckles]

35:07.839 --> 35:11.475
I was, like, "Are you sure
you really wanna do this?"

35:11.509 --> 35:14.411
- [Lisa] Look at the train.
- [Christen] Oh, my...

35:15.646 --> 35:18.281
- I love it!
- Yay!

35:18.316 --> 35:19.516
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

35:19.550 --> 35:21.084
[Lisa] Gorgeous!

35:23.321 --> 35:24.421
[Lisa] Are you ready?

35:25.323 --> 35:27.023
Come up on the pedestal.

35:27.325 --> 35:28.258
Oh, gosh!

35:28.292 --> 35:29.226
[Lisa] Look at this.

35:30.328 --> 35:30.894
Whoo!

35:31.863 --> 35:33.530
[Lisa] How are you feeling
in this, Christen?

35:33.564 --> 35:35.499
I'm like, it's hard to breathe!

35:35.533 --> 35:37.701
I think I envisioned it
so many times

35:37.735 --> 35:39.803
going so terribly
that it's just...

35:39.837 --> 35:42.506
It's just a really special,
exciting moment,

35:42.540 --> 35:44.541
and I can't believe
it's happening.

35:44.575 --> 35:45.976
[Lisa] What do you think, Mom?

35:47.678 --> 35:50.347
I love it. I love it.
I think it's her.

35:51.249 --> 35:52.616
[Lisa] So, are you relieved?

35:52.650 --> 35:55.452
[Christen's mom]
Absolutely. [chuckles]

35:55.486 --> 35:56.553
- [Christen] Yes.
- [Lisa] Let me tell you something,

35:56.587 --> 35:58.288
I'm feeling good.

35:58.322 --> 36:02.526
I'm glad to see, I mean this
is like really a fabulous fit.

36:02.560 --> 36:03.760
-[Christen] Right.
-[Christen's mom] Yes, it's lovely.

36:03.794 --> 36:08.231
So are you saying yes again
to the dress?

36:08.266 --> 36:09.699
I'm saying yes again.

36:09.734 --> 36:12.502
-[all cheering] -[Christen's
mom] Love it. Love it.

36:12.537 --> 36:15.372
- High-five so we don't get makeup on it.
- [cheering]

36:16.440 --> 36:17.908
[Christen]<i> We've waited</i>
<i>all these months</i>

36:17.942 --> 36:21.756
<i>and no more dreams of not
having a wedding dress on the day.</i>

36:21.780 --> 36:24.514
<i>It's even more beautiful in
person, and I'm just freaking out</i>

36:24.549 --> 36:27.284
<i>because I have a dress.
And I'm bringing it home,</i>

36:27.318 --> 36:28.418
<i>And I'm gonna get married.</i>

36:28.452 --> 36:29.920
[chuckles]

36:30.988 --> 36:32.556
[Christen]<i> I cannot wait</i>
<i>to become your wife today</i>

36:32.590 --> 36:34.457
<i>in front of all
of our friends and family.</i>

36:34.492 --> 36:36.259
[all exclaiming happily]

36:37.428 --> 36:38.428
I love it.

36:38.462 --> 36:40.130
It's gorgeous.

36:41.299 --> 36:42.999
- But what?
- [Charlotte] Mom...

36:43.034 --> 36:45.468
[Ryleigh] I just feel like
you aren't 100% yet.

36:45.503 --> 36:46.403
No.

36:53.344 --> 36:54.878
Oh, I absolutely love it.

36:54.912 --> 36:58.248
[Ryleigh]<i> I feel so beautiful</i>
<i>in this dress.</i>

36:58.282 --> 36:59.549
Just gotta get Mom on board.

36:59.584 --> 37:01.218
Oh, here she comes.

37:02.386 --> 37:03.520
[Charlotte and Kendall] Yay!

37:03.554 --> 37:05.322
[Charlotte] Isn't it a breath
of fresh air?

37:05.356 --> 37:06.256
It really is.

37:06.290 --> 37:07.390
I love it.

37:12.330 --> 37:13.763
It is so beautiful.

37:13.798 --> 37:16.833
- [Charlotte] You're so pretty.
- [Kendall] All right, I love it so much.

37:17.335 --> 37:19.002
Yeah, it's gorgeous.

37:20.204 --> 37:21.504
- Mom?
- [Jill] No.

37:21.539 --> 37:23.373
- No. No.
- [Kendall] She wants to see it.

37:23.407 --> 37:25.508
How it photographs
and you to see it.

37:25.543 --> 37:27.143
If you're gonna be
happy with it.

37:27.178 --> 37:28.979
- It literally looks white-white.
- I love it in pictures.

37:29.847 --> 37:31.715
[Jill] Do you see
how it cuts right there?

37:31.749 --> 37:34.050
[Ryleigh] Yeah, you don't like
how it cuts there?

37:34.085 --> 37:35.418
No, I do, honey.

37:35.453 --> 37:38.221
- I want... I wanted you to see it...
- [Ryleigh] I don't mind it.

37:38.256 --> 37:38.822
To make sure...

37:39.857 --> 37:43.460
I like it. I just feel like
you aren't 100% yet.

37:43.494 --> 37:44.995
I'm going to get the designer
on FaceTime,

37:45.029 --> 37:49.432
because I think she'll be perfect to
answer any questions that Jill has.

37:49.467 --> 37:52.402
- Hi, Martine, can you see me?
<i>- Hi!</i>

37:52.436 --> 37:54.170
I hope you're doing well.

37:54.205 --> 37:55.905
<i>I am. I miss you guys.</i>

37:55.940 --> 37:57.941
Ryleigh's mom is nervous
about how this dress breaks,

37:57.975 --> 38:01.378
but it's really a great look
and a great modern silhouette

38:01.412 --> 38:03.013
<i>because it breaks
above the knee,</i>

38:03.047 --> 38:07.951
which is so nice for brides to be able
to walk and move all night in the dress,

38:07.985 --> 38:09.452
and still get
a little extra drama.

38:09.487 --> 38:12.289
I have a very
special guest here.

38:12.323 --> 38:14.424
- This is Martine.
- [women greeting]

38:15.426 --> 38:18.128
<i>- Hi, guys.</i>
- [women] Hello!

38:18.162 --> 38:19.296
<i>How are you?</i>

38:19.330 --> 38:21.464
I am obsessed with this dress.

38:21.499 --> 38:23.500
It's literally my dream dress.

38:23.534 --> 38:26.703
<i>Oh, well, thank you for
wearing it so beautifully.</i>

38:26.737 --> 38:29.472
<i>All the</i> [indistinct]
<i>and the fit-and-flare...</i>

38:29.507 --> 38:31.641
<i>You just look perfect in it.</i>

38:31.676 --> 38:34.778
So, Martine, Ryleigh's mom,
Jill, had some questions

38:34.812 --> 38:38.448
about how much flare
we get at the bottom.

38:38.482 --> 38:40.283
We wanted to soften this up
a little bit.

38:40.318 --> 38:45.355
<i>We could definitely take some out in alterations
to just give it a much softer effect.</i>

38:46.123 --> 38:47.624
Okay! Yay!

38:47.658 --> 38:51.227
- Yay!
- Perfect. That's what we wanted. Yay!

38:51.262 --> 38:53.363
Thank you so much, Martine.

38:53.397 --> 38:54.297
<i>Bye, guys.</i>

38:54.332 --> 38:56.299
I love it. It's the one.

38:56.367 --> 38:57.534
[gasps]

38:57.568 --> 38:59.469
- It's the one.
- It's the one?

38:59.503 --> 39:01.071
I think it's the one.

39:01.105 --> 39:02.305
- [Charlotte] Wow!
- [Kendall] If Mom says it's the one,

39:02.340 --> 39:04.574
it's a game-changer then.

39:04.608 --> 39:07.444
- Oh, Ryleigh!
- It's so beautiful.

39:08.379 --> 39:10.213
It's making my eyes water.

39:10.247 --> 39:11.314
I love it!

39:11.349 --> 39:12.549
[all cheering]

39:12.583 --> 39:14.384
This is the one.

39:14.418 --> 39:17.687
I wasn't sure it was
the right dress for Ry,

39:17.722 --> 39:20.590
<i>until I saw it
for the second time.</i>

39:20.624 --> 39:24.728
<i>I saw her glowing, and it
made me, all of a sudden,</i>

39:24.762 --> 39:28.631
like, your vibes came...
I'm like, [gasps] that's it!

39:28.666 --> 39:30.600
- Oh, honey, it's beautiful.
- [Ryleigh] What do you think?

39:30.634 --> 39:32.635
- I think it's stunning.
- It's beautiful.

39:32.670 --> 39:34.204
- [Kendall] It's perfect.
- This is the one.

39:34.238 --> 39:37.374
Well, I need to ask you
a very important question.

39:37.408 --> 39:38.274
Yes?

39:38.309 --> 39:39.275
Ryleigh...

39:40.578 --> 39:42.979
Are you saying yes to the dress?

39:43.214 --> 39:45.415
Yes!

39:46.384 --> 39:48.451
- Yay!
- Yes, this is the dress.

39:48.486 --> 39:51.388
[Ryleigh]<i> I needed my mom</i>
<i>to give me her approval</i>

39:51.422 --> 39:52.722
<i>just because
it means so much to me.</i>

39:52.757 --> 39:54.591
I'm so happy that you love it.

39:54.625 --> 39:56.726
I'm happy you love it.
