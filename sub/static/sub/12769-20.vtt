♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:07.250 --> 00:11.417
(indistinct conversations)

00:11.458 --> 00:14.083
(knock on door)

00:14.125 --> 00:17.041
COOPER, GET OUT.

00:17.083 --> 00:19.041
OH, YOU LOOK INCREDIBLE.

00:19.083 --> 00:21.333
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO SEE ME YET.

00:21.375 --> 00:23.041
I THINK...

00:23.083 --> 00:26.000
I-I THINK IT'S A MISTAKE
FOR US TO DO THIS.

00:29.166 --> 00:31.458
(elevator bell dings)

00:31.500 --> 00:34.500
(indistinct conversations)

00:37.458 --> 00:40.041
(exhales deeply)

00:40.083 --> 00:42.667
HEY. YOU OKAY?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:42.709 --> 00:45.041
ARE YOU
WORRIED ABOUT SOMETHING?

00:45.083 --> 00:47.041
ARE YOU GETTING
PRE-WEDDING JITTERS?

00:47.083 --> 00:49.875
YOU GONNA JILT COOPER
AT THE ALTAR?

00:49.917 --> 00:51.875
BECAUSE I WILL DRIVE
THE GETAWAY VEHICLE,

00:51.917 --> 00:53.917
NO QUESTIONS ASKED.
I AM NOT JILTING, COOP.

00:53.959 --> 00:56.917
IT'S JUST, WEDDINGS MEAN FAMILY,
AND OUR FAMILIES...

00:56.959 --> 01:00.041
(sighs) LOOK, MY MAMA IS
A STRAIGHT-UP SOUTHERN BELLE,

01:00.083 --> 01:02.041
WHICH MEANS
SHE'S CHARMING, JUDGMENTAL,

01:02.083 --> 01:04.041
AND NOT AFRAID
TO SELF-MEDICATE.

01:04.083 --> 01:05.041
(chuckles)

01:05.083 --> 01:07.041
IMAGINING HER
WITH THE FREEDMANS...

01:07.083 --> 01:09.000
AND IF THEY'RE ANYTHING LIKE
THEIR SON,

01:09.041 --> 01:11.000
THEY'LL WANT TO HUG HER
AND KISS HER

01:11.041 --> 01:14.000
AND WHINE ABOUT HOW THERE AREN'T
ANY GOOD DELIS IN LOS ANGELES.

01:14.041 --> 01:16.083
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
WHEN YOU HAVE THOSE

01:16.125 --> 01:19.083
"WORLDS COLLIDE" SITUATIONS,
THEY ACTUALLY TURN OUT OKAY.
AND SOMETIMES THEY END
WITH A GIANT FIREBALL

01:19.125 --> 01:20.917
THAT CONSUMES
EVERYTHING AROUND 'EM.

01:20.959 --> 01:22.917
WELL, HOW MUCH TIME DO THEY
HAVE TO SPEND TOGETHER

01:22.959 --> 01:24.291
BEFORE THE WEDDING?

01:24.333 --> 01:26.959
(sighs) COOPER AND I THOUGHT
WE COULD LIMIT IT TO A DINNER.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.959
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO HELP?

01:29.000 --> 01:30.542
PLAN THE DINNER.

01:30.583 --> 01:34.083
OH. OKAY. UH, I WAS REALLY
JUST ASKING TO BE POLITE,

01:34.125 --> 01:37.041
BUT YOU REALLY WANT ME
TO DO IT?

01:37.083 --> 01:39.750
I JUST FIGURED, IF YOU'RE
GONNA BE MY MAID OF HONOR...

01:39.792 --> 01:42.041
WAIT. WHAT? REALLY? ME?

01:42.083 --> 01:45.083
WE'RE JUNKIES TOGETHER. THAT
MAKES US B.F.F.s IN MY BOOK.

01:45.125 --> 01:47.917
AND COOPER HAS VIOLET
AS HIS BEST MAN.

01:47.959 --> 01:50.875
HE KEEPS SAYING I NEED SOMEONE
TO STAND UP WITH ME,

01:50.917 --> 01:53.875
SO I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE YOU
TO BE MY MAID OF HONOR.

01:53.917 --> 01:57.291
JUST DON'T FORGET TO BRING
YOUR FIRE EXTINGUISHER.

01:59.709 --> 02:03.041
(footsteps approach)

02:03.083 --> 02:05.041
(knocks on door)

02:05.083 --> 02:08.000
CAN I HELP YOU?
I'M DR. VIOLET TURNER.

02:08.041 --> 02:11.041
I WAS TOLD YOU WERE THE MEDICAL
INVESTIGATOR ON MY CASE.

02:11.083 --> 02:13.542
DID WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
FOR TODAY?

02:13.583 --> 02:15.875
NO. NO, I JUST... I THOUGHT
WE COULD TAKE A FEW MOMENTS

02:15.917 --> 02:17.875
TO TALK ABOUT KATIE KENT.

02:17.917 --> 02:20.875
DR. TURNER--
I MEAN, THIS WHOLE THING HAS
BEEN BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION,

02:20.917 --> 02:24.250
AND I-I WANTED TO TELL MY SIDE
OF THE STORY, AND YOU'LL SEE--

02:24.291 --> 02:26.917
I-I THINK WE CAN AVOID
WASTING EVERYONE'S TIME

02:26.959 --> 02:28.917
ON ANY KIND
OF FORMAL INVESTIGATION.

02:28.959 --> 02:31.750
WE HAVE A PROTOCOL,
AND I'M OBLIGATED TO FOLLOW IT.

02:31.792 --> 02:34.208
PLEASE HEAR ME OUT.

02:34.250 --> 02:38.041
AS LONG AS YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT WHATEVER YOU TELL ME

02:38.083 --> 02:40.417
WILL IN NO WAY
LIMIT THE INVESTIGATION

02:40.458 --> 02:43.208
WE'VE ALREADY OPENED
INTO YOUR CASE

02:43.250 --> 02:45.000
AND CAN ALSO BE USED

02:45.041 --> 02:47.041
AS THE BASIS
FOR FURTHER INQUIRIES.

02:47.083 --> 02:49.500
(opens drawer)

02:49.542 --> 02:51.000
(clicks button)

02:53.000 --> 02:55.125
READY WHEN YOU ARE.

03:05.709 --> 03:09.458
(people speaking indistinctly)

03:09.500 --> 03:11.875
HEY.

03:11.917 --> 03:14.458
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE BACK.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.875
UH, HOW WAS AFRICA?

03:16.917 --> 03:19.041
IT WAS GOOD.
IT WAS REALLY GOOD.

03:19.083 --> 03:21.125
YEAH? YOU LOOK AMAZING.
ARE YOU--

03:21.166 --> 03:23.125
I'M--I'M--I'M LATE
FOR A MEETING. HI.

03:23.166 --> 03:25.333
HEY. WELCOME BACK,
NA--
YEAH.

03:25.375 --> 03:27.667
OMI.
SHE HATES ME.

03:27.709 --> 03:29.667
WELL, SHE'S NOT TOO CRAZY
ABOUT ME, EITHER.

03:29.709 --> 03:32.041
SO, UH...

03:32.083 --> 03:34.583
ARE WE STILL AGREED?

03:34.625 --> 03:36.583
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
KEEP ASKING ME THAT.

03:36.625 --> 03:38.875
WELL, I JUST DON'T WANT
THINGS TO BE AWKWARD

03:38.917 --> 03:41.500
FOR CHARLOTTE AND COOPER.
IT'S NOT GONNA BE,
ALL RIGHT?

03:41.542 --> 03:43.500
WE'RE NOT GONNA TELL ANYBODY
WE'RE BROKEN UP.

03:43.542 --> 03:45.500
WE'RE GONNA GO
TO THE WEDDING TOGETHER,

03:45.542 --> 03:48.709
AND THEN AFTERWARDS, WE'RE
GONNA TELL EVERYBODY THAT--
WE'RE STILL FRIENDS. OKAY.

03:48.750 --> 03:51.166
(Addison pours liquid)

03:51.208 --> 03:53.291
(knock on door)

03:53.333 --> 03:55.458
YOU'RE GONNA GET A CALL
FROM THE MEDICAL BOARD

03:55.500 --> 03:57.041
INVESTIGATING VIOLET.

03:57.083 --> 03:59.250
I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S THIS SERIOUS.

03:59.291 --> 04:02.041
WELL, BELIEVE.
THEY'RE GONNA INTERVIEW YOU.
ME?

04:02.083 --> 04:04.041
YOU AND I ARE THE ONLY OTHER
DOCTORS WHO TREATED KATIE,

04:04.083 --> 04:06.792
AND I JUST GOT MY CALL, SO...
YOU REALLY THINK

04:06.834 --> 04:09.834
THERE'S A CHANCE
SHE COULD LOSE HER LICENSE?
YES.

04:09.875 --> 04:12.208
BUT IF WE CAN HELP EXPLAIN
WHAT HAPPENED...

04:12.250 --> 04:15.250
JUST BE VERY CAREFUL
WHEN YOU ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS.

04:15.291 --> 04:18.125
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT ASKING ME
TO LIE.

04:18.166 --> 04:20.125
I'M ASKING YOU
TO PROTECT VIOLET.

04:20.166 --> 04:22.125
I DON'T NEED
TO BE PROTECTED.

04:22.166 --> 04:24.417
ALL THE THERAPY
I DID WITH KATIE,

04:24.458 --> 04:27.041
THE--THE ATTACK, THE TRIAL,
THE BOOK--

04:27.083 --> 04:29.041
I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE,

04:29.083 --> 04:31.083
AND NEITHER DO YOU.

04:38.542 --> 04:40.041
(motor whirs)

04:40.083 --> 04:42.041
MISS ME?

04:42.083 --> 04:43.917
(gasps) GABRIEL,
WHAT ARE YOU--

04:43.959 --> 04:45.917
I HEARD YOUR SPEECH,
BUT I AM CONFIDENT

04:45.959 --> 04:48.041
THAT EVENTUALLY, YOU WILL
SEE THE ERROR OF YOUR WAYS,

04:48.083 --> 04:50.792
AND WHEN YOU DO,
I'LL BE HERE, WAITING.

04:50.834 --> 04:52.166
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

04:52.208 --> 04:54.166
I HAVE A PATIENT
IN ASSISTED LIVING.

04:54.208 --> 04:57.083
I'M MAKING A HOUSE CALL.

04:57.125 --> 04:59.083
THERE ARE LAWS
AGAINST STALKING.

04:59.125 --> 05:02.041
OH, PRISON DOESN'T SCARE ME.

05:02.083 --> 05:03.458
(door opens)

05:03.500 --> 05:05.166
(Naomi) MARION?

05:05.208 --> 05:08.000
(motor whirs)

05:08.041 --> 05:09.917
MARION?

05:09.959 --> 05:12.583
HI. DID I FORGET
TO TELL YOU THAT I WAS COMING?

05:12.625 --> 05:15.375
OH, I'M SURE YOU DIDN'T.

05:15.417 --> 05:17.333
UH, THIS IS DR. FIFE.

05:17.375 --> 05:20.583
HE'S A COLLEAGUE OF MINE.

05:20.625 --> 05:22.625
WHY DON'T WE GIVE MARION
A-A MINUTE?

05:22.667 --> 05:24.709
I'VE NEVER SEEN HER
IN ANYTHING OTHER THAN A DRESS

05:24.750 --> 05:28.041
WITH HER HAIR AND NAILS DONE,
WHICH MEANS SHE'S BEING POLITE.

05:28.083 --> 05:29.792
WOULDN'T HAVE MATTERED.

05:32.458 --> 05:34.041
IS THIS YOU?

05:34.083 --> 05:36.041
YES, AND MY HUSBAND JEROME.

05:36.083 --> 05:37.917
HOW LONG WERE YOU MARRIED?

05:37.959 --> 05:42.041
JEROME DIED JUST BEFORE
OUR 51st ANNIVERSARY.
(beeps)

05:42.083 --> 05:45.291
WELL, BET YOU CAN STILL
FIT IN THAT DRESS.

05:45.333 --> 05:48.625
MARION, YOUR GLUCOSE
IS REALLY HIGH.

05:48.667 --> 05:51.041
HAVE YOU BEEN TAKING
YOUR INSULIN?
(motor whirs, thuds)

05:51.083 --> 05:52.583
OH, CAREFUL.

05:52.625 --> 05:54.208
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

05:54.250 --> 05:56.041
OH.

05:56.083 --> 05:59.041
YOU'RE NOT YOURSELF TODAY,
MARION. DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

05:59.083 --> 06:02.041
IF YOU WANT TO TALK,
DR. FIFE CAN LEAVE AND--

06:02.083 --> 06:03.583
OH, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

06:05.375 --> 06:07.041
YOU KNOW, MARION,

06:07.083 --> 06:09.041
THERE IS A THERAPIST
HERE ON STAFF.

06:09.083 --> 06:11.166
AND I HAVE TWO IN MY OFFICE.

06:11.208 --> 06:13.583
YOU WANT ME TO TALK
TO SO-SOME STRANGER

06:13.625 --> 06:15.041
HALF MY AGE,

06:15.083 --> 06:16.834
TELL 'EM I'M SAD,

06:16.875 --> 06:18.834
AND THEN LISTEN TO HIM
TRY TO PUT THINGS

06:18.875 --> 06:20.875
IN A PERSPECTIVE
HE DOESN'T HAVE?

06:20.917 --> 06:23.041
I-I-IT'S JUST, THAT IF
YOU'RE REALLY SAD, THEN--

06:23.083 --> 06:24.875
WE CAN ZAP THE SADNESS OUT.

06:24.917 --> 06:28.375
THERE'S A PROCEDURE CALLED
AN ANTERIOR CINGULOTOMY.

06:28.417 --> 06:30.709
THE NEUROSURGEON USES
A GAMMA KNIFE

06:30.750 --> 06:33.083
TO DESTROY THE PARTS OF
THE BRAIN THAT CAUSE DEPRESSION.

06:33.125 --> 06:34.917
GABRIEL.

06:34.959 --> 06:36.917
OH. LISTEN, THANK YOU BOTH
FOR COMING HERE.

06:36.959 --> 06:40.041
I'LL TRY TO REMEMBER
THE INSULIN.

06:40.083 --> 06:42.041
BUT I DON'T NEED SHRINKS

06:42.083 --> 06:43.709
AND I DON'T NEED KNIVES.

06:43.750 --> 06:46.834
I JUST NEED TO BE LEFT ALONE.

06:51.417 --> 06:53.041
(Violet) OH.

06:53.083 --> 06:55.041
HEY, COOPER,
UH, THIS IS, UH,

06:55.083 --> 06:57.166
THIS IS MY LAWYER,
RICHARD HUVANE.
HELLO.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.375
YOU WENT TO SPEAK WITH
NEAL CHAPLIN WITHOUT ME PRESENT?

06:59.417 --> 07:02.417
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
I WAS THINKING THAT IF KATIE
HAS DROPPED THE LAWSUIT,

07:02.458 --> 07:05.041
THERE'S NO REASON FOR
THE MEDICAL BOARD TO PURSUE IT.
BUT THEY ARE PURSUING IT.

07:05.083 --> 07:07.041
AND NOW THAT THEY'VE OPENED
AN INVESTIGATION,

07:07.083 --> 07:09.500
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT SHE DOES.

07:09.542 --> 07:11.500
WELL, I...
I-I-I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

07:11.542 --> 07:13.500
AS SOON AS HE BROUGHT OUT
THE RECORDER, I LEFT.

07:13.542 --> 07:15.834
I'M GONNA CATCH UP
TO YOU LATER, OKAY?

07:15.875 --> 07:18.917
LOOK, I-I WAS JUST THINKING
THAT IF I COULD...

07:18.959 --> 07:21.834
(sighs) I TALKED TO PETE
ABOUT IT--

07:21.875 --> 07:24.083
PETE IS NOW A WITNESS
IN THIS INVESTIGATION.

07:24.125 --> 07:26.875
ARE--ARE YOU SAYING
I NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS

07:26.917 --> 07:28.417
AROUND MY OWN HUSBAND?

07:28.458 --> 07:31.208
YOU NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS
AROUND EVERYONE.

07:31.250 --> 07:33.542
IT'S YOUR LICENSE
THAT'S ON THE LINE.

07:42.166 --> 07:45.041
THE WOMAN IS PROBABLY JUST
DEPRESSED, AND FIFE SUGGESTS

07:45.083 --> 07:47.917
DESTROYING PART OF HER BRAIN.
WELL, IF YOU INVITED HIM,
YOU SHOULD'VE KNOWN.

07:47.959 --> 07:50.458
I DID NOT INVITE HIM.
IT'S PART OF MY STRATEGY.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.667
I DID AN ANTERIOR CINGULOTOMY
BACK AT HOPKINS.

07:52.709 --> 07:55.333
PRE-OP, THE MAN WOULD NOT
EVEN GET OUT OF BED.

07:55.375 --> 07:58.041
POST-OP, HE WAS COOKING DINNER
FOR THE ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD.

07:58.083 --> 08:00.083
WE GAVE HIM HIS LIFE BACK.
SO THERE.

08:00.125 --> 08:02.041
BUT ANY SURGERY
ON SOMEONE MARION'S AGE

08:02.083 --> 08:04.458
IS GONNA BE RIFE
WITH POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS,

08:04.500 --> 08:07.458
INCLUDING A STROKE--
WELL, YOU HAVE TO BE
BRAVE ENOUGH TO TAKE THAT RISK.

08:07.500 --> 08:10.041
ACTUALLY, YOU'RE ASKING
THE PATIENT TO TAKE THAT RISK,

08:10.083 --> 08:12.041
WHICH I'M NOT SURE
MAKES YOU BRAVE AT ALL.

08:12.083 --> 08:14.041
MORE IMPORTANTLY, MARION HAS
ALREADY MADE IT CLEAR

08:14.083 --> 08:17.208
THAT SHE DOES NOT WANT
THIS SURGERY.
THAT'S THE DEPRESSION TALKING.

08:17.250 --> 08:18.834
IT'S CLOUDING HER JUDGMENT

08:18.875 --> 08:20.834
AND MAKING HER INCAPABLE
OF AN INFORMED DECISION.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.834
DEPRESSION DOESN'T NECESSARILY
MAKE SOMEONE INCOMPETENT.

08:22.875 --> 08:24.333
UNLESS IT DOES,

08:24.375 --> 08:26.291
WHICH MAKES THIS
KIND OF A CATCH-22.

08:26.333 --> 08:28.125
I MEAN, WE CAN'T TREAT
HER DEPRESSION

08:28.166 --> 08:30.542
IF HER DEPRESSION IS PREVENTING
HER FROM SEEKING TREATMENT.

08:30.583 --> 08:33.709
MARION SHOULDN'T BE
INCLUDED IN THIS.
WHAT?

08:33.750 --> 08:37.041
THE DISEASE DETERMINES
THE CURE, NOT THE PATIENT.
LISTENING TO YOUR PATIENT,
WORKING WITH THEM,

08:37.083 --> 08:39.208
THAT'S ESSENTIAL
TO GOOD DOCTORING.

08:39.250 --> 08:41.667
HEALING IS ESSENTIAL
TO GOOD DOCTORING.

08:41.709 --> 08:44.250
AMELIA USES THE GAMMA KNIFE,
MARION WILL FEEL BETTER.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.959
IT'S A WIN-WIN.
NO ONE IS DOING
ANY KIND OF CUTTING

08:47.000 --> 08:48.959
UNTIL WE DETERMINE
JUST HOW BAD OFF MARION IS.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.625
WILL YOU PLEASE
TALK TO HER?

08:51.667 --> 08:53.250
SURE.

08:53.291 --> 08:55.333
THANK YOU.

08:55.375 --> 08:57.959
WHAT A LOVELY PLACE
TO WORK.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.041
AND, UH, SAVING THE BEST
FOR LAST--

09:00.083 --> 09:02.417
THIS IS THE OFFICE
OF DR. CHARLOTTE KING.

09:02.458 --> 09:05.625
(laughter)

09:05.667 --> 09:08.250
(man) VIOLET,
YOU ARE FUNNY AS EVER.

09:08.291 --> 09:10.333
OH.
WHOO-HOO.

09:10.375 --> 09:13.333
(woman claps hands)
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:13.375 --> 09:15.458
OOH.
HI. (laughs)

09:15.500 --> 09:18.875
YOU TOLD US TO WAIT,
BUT YOU KNOW YOUR MOTHER.

09:18.917 --> 09:21.208
WE WERE TOO EXCITED,
SO WE CAME ON OVER.

09:21.250 --> 09:23.208
AND THEN WE SAW VIOLET
IN THE ELEVATOR...

09:23.250 --> 09:27.041
WHO HAS THIS AMAZING FIGURE,
EVEN AFTER HAVING A BABY.
(Cooper) YEAH, YEAH.

09:27.083 --> 09:32.041
YEAH, I WAS JUST COMING
TO FIND YOU.
UH, MOM, DAD,

09:32.083 --> 09:34.375
UM, THIS IS CHARLOTTE,
AND THIS IS HER MOTHER,

09:34.417 --> 09:36.583
AUGUSTA KING.

09:36.625 --> 09:38.792
IT'S A PLEASURE.
HELLO.

09:38.834 --> 09:40.875
HELLO.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

09:49.083 --> 09:53.333
WELL, ISN'T THIS GREAT,
EVERYBODY FINALLY MEETING?

09:53.375 --> 09:55.291
(chuckles)

09:55.333 --> 09:58.083
HEY, MAYBE I'LL JUST SHOW MAMA
AROUND THE REST OF THE OFFICE.

09:58.125 --> 10:01.041
OH, GREAT IDEA. UM, WHY DON'T
YOU GUYS COME WITH US? GO WITH--

10:01.083 --> 10:03.333
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, YOUR MOTHER
AND I ARE KIND OF HUNGRY.

10:03.375 --> 10:05.458
(Violet) OH, WELL, IT'S--
IT'S LUNCH TIME RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

10:05.500 --> 10:08.083
WHY DON'T YOU ALL GO
TO THE PROMENADE

10:08.125 --> 10:10.625
AND HAVE LUNCH FIRST?
(woman) THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
AND YOU'LL BE JOINING US, RIGHT?

10:10.667 --> 10:14.041
OH, WELL, I'M--I'M REALLY
KIND OF BUSY.
OF COURSE SHE'S COMING
WITH US.

10:14.083 --> 10:16.667
CHARLOTTE, I'D LOVE TO SEE
YOUR OFFICE. NOW.

10:16.709 --> 10:18.959
OH, BUT LET'S, UH...
UH, LUNCH?

10:19.000 --> 10:21.041
ANOTHER TIME.

10:21.083 --> 10:22.959
ENJOY.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.041
(man) WELL, I'M THINKING DELI,
BUT, UH,

10:26.083 --> 10:29.041
I COULD BE PERSUADED TO TRY
SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE RISQUE.

10:29.083 --> 10:30.792
(footsteps approach)

10:30.834 --> 10:32.792
(knock on door)
(Addison) HEY.

10:32.834 --> 10:34.792
I KEEP RUNNING INTO FIFE
IN THE HALLS.

10:34.834 --> 10:37.291
IS HE, UH, WORKING HERE
AGAIN OR--

10:37.333 --> 10:40.875
NO, HE JUST--HE SAYS HE WON'T GO
AWAY UNTIL I AGREE TO DATE HIM.

10:40.917 --> 10:42.250
WOW.

10:42.291 --> 10:46.250
I GIVE HIM A 10
FOR PERSEVERANCE.

10:46.291 --> 10:48.917
SO WHAT DO YOU RATE HIM
FOR STYLE?

10:48.959 --> 10:50.500
YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:50.542 --> 10:53.458
I HAVE A BUNCH OF RESEARCH
I HAVE TO DO, SO...

10:53.500 --> 10:56.291
OH. OKAY.

10:56.333 --> 10:57.750
OKAY.

11:00.083 --> 11:03.917
HEY, SAM AND I BROKE UP.
I, UH...

11:03.959 --> 11:06.041
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

11:10.333 --> 11:11.709
WHY?

11:11.750 --> 11:14.500
WELL, HE WOULDN'T COMMIT
TO HAVING A CHILD WITH ME

11:14.542 --> 11:16.500
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO WAIT--

11:16.542 --> 11:18.583
NO, I MEANT WHY--WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME THIS?

11:18.625 --> 11:20.166
I MEAN, Y--

11:20.208 --> 11:22.709
YOU AND I,
WE'RE NOT EXACTLY...

11:22.750 --> 11:25.625
LOOK, NAI, THERE'S BEEN
THIS WALL UP BETWEEN YOU AND ME

11:25.667 --> 11:27.625
SINCE SAM AND I GOT TOGETHER,

11:27.667 --> 11:29.667
AND I DON'T
WANT IT THERE ANYMORE.

11:29.709 --> 11:31.709
I WANT MY BEST FRIEND BACK.

11:37.083 --> 11:40.875
THAT'S IT?
YOU'RE NOT GONNA SAY ANYTHING?

11:42.291 --> 11:44.625
I HOPE IT WAS WORTH IT.

11:47.291 --> 11:50.583
I TOLD YOU, YOU SHOULD'VE
ORDERED THE BRISKET.

11:50.625 --> 11:54.041
(laughs) I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST,
UM, JUST KIND OF A BAD DAY.

11:54.083 --> 11:57.333
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I-I THINK I SHOULD GO.

11:57.375 --> 11:59.000
WHAT, SO SOON?

11:59.041 --> 12:01.333
DAD, ENOUGH. LET HER GO.

12:01.375 --> 12:04.375
WELL, THE THREE OF YOU
NEED TIME TO CATCH UP,

12:04.417 --> 12:08.667
AND, UM, YEAH, I'LL SEE YOU
BACK AT THE OFFICE.
FINE.

12:10.125 --> 12:12.250
IS EVERYTHING OKAY
WITH VIOLET?

12:12.291 --> 12:14.875
I SWEAR, SHE DIDN'T SMILE ONCE
THE WHOLE MEAL.

12:14.917 --> 12:17.041
SHE IS... GOING THROUGH
A ROUGH PATCH RIGHT NOW.

12:17.083 --> 12:18.875
SHE'LL BE OKAY.

12:18.917 --> 12:20.917
WELL, I HOPE SO.
SHE IS SUCH A GOOD GIRL.

12:20.959 --> 12:22.917
IS THERE ANYTHING
THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP?

12:22.959 --> 12:25.166
YEAH, HOW ABOUT WORRYING
A LITTLE LESS ABOUT VIOLET

12:25.208 --> 12:28.166
AND ASKING ME
ABOUT MY FUTURE WIFE?
WELL, WE INTRODUCED OURSELVES,

12:28.208 --> 12:31.667
AND THEN SHE AND HER MOTHER
WERE GONE.
ARE YOU REALLY SURPRISED?

12:31.709 --> 12:34.041
I MEAN, YOU COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN
WHEN I INTRODUCED YOU.

12:34.083 --> 12:36.917
WELL, THE MOTHER
WAS PLEASANT ENOUGH.

12:36.959 --> 12:41.041
BUT I DID FIND CHARLOTTE
TO BE A BIT... COLD.

12:41.083 --> 12:43.750
CHARLOTTE IS NOT COLD. IT TAKES
A WHILE TO GET TO KNOW HER.

12:43.792 --> 12:45.333
WE KNOW ENOUGH.

12:45.375 --> 12:48.875
OH, YEAH? WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

12:48.917 --> 12:51.250
COOPER,
FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS,

12:51.291 --> 12:53.250
YOUR FATHER AND I
HAVE LISTENED TO YOU--

12:53.291 --> 12:56.041
EVERY PHONE CALL,
EVERY E-MAIL.

12:56.083 --> 12:59.250
AND DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY
OF THOSE WERE YOU BEING UPSET

12:59.291 --> 13:01.875
ABOUT SOMETHING CHARLOTTE DID?
COME ON. WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT IS NOT FAIR.

13:01.917 --> 13:04.875
NO, SHE'S RIGHT, COOP. WE WENT
THROUGH ALL OF THAT WITH YOU--

13:04.917 --> 13:07.959
THE LYING TO THE EX-HUSBAND,
SLEEPING WITH THAT ARTHUR--

13:08.000 --> 13:10.041
ARCHER.
(woman) OH, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

13:10.083 --> 13:12.041
THE POINT IS, SHE'S HURT YOU,
MORE THAN ONCE.

13:12.083 --> 13:15.041
AND WE--WE UNDERSTAND THAT
YOU'RE GOING TO MARRY HER, BUT--

13:15.083 --> 13:17.041
BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
WHY WE CAN'T EXACTLY

13:17.083 --> 13:20.166
OPEN OUR ARMS TO HER AND PRETEND
THAT NOTHING HAPPENED.

13:20.208 --> 13:22.000
YOU'RE--YOU'RE MY PARENTS.

13:22.041 --> 13:24.000
I WAS GIVING YOU ONE SIDE
OF THE STORY.

13:24.041 --> 13:26.041
THERE'S LOTS OF GOOD STUFF
ABOUT CHARLOTTE

13:26.083 --> 13:29.041
THAT I DIDN'T TELL YOU.
WELL, I'M SURE THAT'S TRUE,
BUT WE LOVE YOU, COOPER,

13:29.083 --> 13:31.041
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

13:31.083 --> 13:34.542
SO ANYONE WHO HURTS YOU...

13:34.583 --> 13:36.375
MM.

13:36.417 --> 13:39.500
(indistinct conversations)

13:39.542 --> 13:41.500
(Charlotte) THE CHUPPAH
WILL BE OVER HERE.

13:41.542 --> 13:43.542
UH, THAT'S JUST
A LITTLE GAZEBO.

13:43.583 --> 13:46.083
I KNOW WHAT A CHUPPAH IS,
DARLING.

13:46.125 --> 13:48.500
IT'S THE ONE CONCESSION
COOPER ASKED FOR.

13:48.542 --> 13:50.291
IT'S IMPORTANT
FOR HIS PARENTS.

13:50.333 --> 13:52.041
OH, HIS PARENTS.

13:52.083 --> 13:54.041
YOU KNOW, CHARLOTTE,

13:54.083 --> 13:57.208
THE FREEDMANS
AREN'T THOSE HUGGY, KISSY,

13:57.250 --> 14:00.792
IN-YOUR-FACE KIND OF PEOPLE
YOU WARNED ME ABOUT.

14:00.834 --> 14:02.709
IN FACT,
THEY'RE A LITTLE COLD.

14:02.750 --> 14:05.291
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THEY WERE COLD.

14:05.333 --> 14:07.917
AND THE WAY THEY FAWNED
OVER THAT OTHER DOCTOR--

14:07.959 --> 14:10.083
WHAT'S HER NAME?
VIOLET.

14:10.125 --> 14:13.208
YOU WOULD THINK SHE WAS
THE ONE MARRYING COOPER.

14:13.250 --> 14:15.208
COOPER AND VIOLET
ARE BEST FRIENDS.

14:15.250 --> 14:17.250
HIS PARENTS HAVE KNOWN HER
FOR A LONG TIME.

14:17.291 --> 14:18.875
(laughs) BEST FRIENDS?

14:18.917 --> 14:20.875
I SUGGEST YOU DO AS I DO

14:20.917 --> 14:23.875
AND TRY NOT TO LET THAT
GET UNDER YOUR SKIN.

14:23.917 --> 14:25.250
YOU LISTEN, BABY GIRL,

14:25.291 --> 14:28.208
AS YOUR MOTHER, I HAVE TO
TELL YOU HOW IT IS,

14:28.250 --> 14:30.208
AND HIS PARENTS
DO NOT LIKE YOU.

14:30.250 --> 14:33.875
THEY BARELY KNOW ME.
HONEY, THEY'RE NOT LOOKING
TO KNOW YOU.

14:33.917 --> 14:35.041
MAMA.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.041
NO, LOOK...

14:37.083 --> 14:39.875
I BET THEY'RE OUT THERE
RIGHT NOW WITH COOPER

14:39.917 --> 14:43.875
TELLING HIM THAT YOU ARE NOT
HIS KIND OF GIRL.
I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT.

14:43.917 --> 14:46.041
I'M NOT SAYING
COOPER'S GONNA LISTEN.

14:46.083 --> 14:50.083
I'M JUST SAYING, YOU MARRY
A BOY, YOU MARRY HIS FAMILY.

14:50.125 --> 14:53.041
JUST CONSIDER IT A WARNING.
I CAN'T
TALK ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

14:53.083 --> 14:55.041
I HAVE TO GET
TO MY FINAL DRESS FITTING.

14:55.083 --> 14:58.041
OH, I CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE IT ON YOU. (laughs)

14:58.083 --> 15:00.250
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.

15:00.291 --> 15:02.792
LOOK, MAMA, YOU CAN COME
TO THE FITTING,

15:02.834 --> 15:05.583
BUT THE DRESS... IT'S NOT
GONNA MAKE YOU HAPPY.

15:05.625 --> 15:08.041
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO IT
IN THE MAIL?

15:08.083 --> 15:10.041
NO, IT ARRIVED JUST FINE,

15:10.083 --> 15:14.041
BUT... I'M NOT WEARING
THE FAMILY DRESS.

15:14.083 --> 15:15.417
CHARLOTTE...

15:15.458 --> 15:18.291
FOR A HUNDRED YEARS,
THE WOMEN IN OUR FAMILY

15:18.333 --> 15:21.417
HAVE WORN THAT DRESS
WHEN THEY TOOK THEIR VOWS.

15:21.458 --> 15:23.041
IS THIS BECAUSE OF COOPER?

15:23.083 --> 15:25.458
HAS HE TALKED YOU OUT
OF WEARING THAT DRESS?

15:25.500 --> 15:27.458
COOPER DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THE DRESS.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.125
NOW LISTEN TO ME, MAMA.

15:29.166 --> 15:31.125
I WORE THE DRESS
WHEN I MARRIED BILLY,

15:31.166 --> 15:33.458
AND LOOK WHERE THAT GOT ME.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.875
(scoffs) THAT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE
THE DRESS' FAULT.

15:36.917 --> 15:39.250
NOW I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS,

15:39.291 --> 15:41.458
BUT IT'S WHAT BIG DADDY
WOULD'VE WANTED.

15:41.500 --> 15:44.250
AND I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT
TO LET HIM DOWN.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.500
(sighs) DR. BENNETT
SHOULD LEAVE WELL ENOUGH ALONE.

15:51.542 --> 15:53.959
WELL, DR. BENNETT DOESN'T FEEL
YOU ARE WELL ENOUGH.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.959
THAT'S WHY SHE ASKED ME
TO TALK TO YOU.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.458
SHE'S CONCERNED
THAT YOU MIGHT BE DEPRESSED.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.041
SHE SAID SHE OFFERED YOU
SEVERAL TREATMENT OPTIONS,

16:01.083 --> 16:04.083
BUT YOU DIDN'T SEEM
TO HAVE ANY INTEREST.
WELL, THAT'S MY RIGHT,
ISN'T IT?

16:04.125 --> 16:06.709
YES, BUT OUR GOAL
IS TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

16:06.750 --> 16:08.709
AND IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT YOUR ILLNESS

16:08.750 --> 16:10.166
IS STANDING IN THE WAY

16:10.208 --> 16:13.166
OF YOUR ABILITY TO DISCERN
WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU.

16:13.208 --> 16:16.750
DR. WALLACE,
ONE DAY YOU'LL BE OLD.

16:16.792 --> 16:20.166
YOU'LL BE OLD AND THEN
EVENTUALLY YOU'LL BE SICK.

16:20.208 --> 16:23.875
AND THEN YOU'LL BE SAD...
AND LONELY.

16:23.917 --> 16:26.875
AND SOMETIMES, YOU WON'T WANT
TO GET OUT OF BED

16:26.917 --> 16:29.041
OR BE WITH PEOPLE.

16:29.083 --> 16:32.291
WHEN THAT HAPPENS, I HOPE NOBODY
TREATS YOU LIKE A CHILD,

16:32.333 --> 16:35.834
BECAUSE IT ONLY MAKES YOU
FEEL WORSE.

16:42.083 --> 16:44.041
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU WANT TO AVOID ME,

16:44.083 --> 16:46.041
YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER
THAN TO COME IN HERE

16:46.083 --> 16:48.041
WHEN I'M HAVING
MY PRE-DINNER BREAKFAST.

16:48.083 --> 16:51.041
OH. I'M NOT TRYING
TO AVOID YOU.

16:51.083 --> 16:52.583
I'M NOT.

16:52.625 --> 16:54.583
I JUST, UH...

16:54.625 --> 16:58.125
IT'S JUST, THE REENTRY
GETS HARDER EVERY TIME.

16:58.166 --> 17:00.500
(laughs)

17:00.542 --> 17:03.458
YOU KNOW, I MISS MAYA AND OLIVIA
SO MUCH WHEN I'M GONE.

17:03.500 --> 17:06.125
BUT WHEN I'M TRAVELING
FOR THE FOUNDATION,

17:06.166 --> 17:08.959
I JUST--I-I HAVE A PURPOSE.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.333
YOU KNOW, THE WORK WE DO,
IT'S CHANGING LIVES,

17:11.375 --> 17:14.041
AND I SEE IT.
I SEE IT EVERY DAY.

17:14.083 --> 17:17.542
THEN I COME BACK HERE
TO ALL THE... PETTY DRAMA.

17:17.583 --> 17:20.458
(laughs) WE'RE PRETTY
WELL-STOCKED IN THAT.

17:20.500 --> 17:23.041
YEAH. I'M SORRY.

17:23.083 --> 17:25.542
I-I DIDN'T MEAN TO DOWNPLAY
WHAT HAPPENED

17:25.583 --> 17:28.250
WITH YOU AND ADDISON.

17:30.291 --> 17:33.041
SHE TOLD YOU.

17:33.083 --> 17:34.750
UNBELIEVABLE.

17:34.792 --> 17:37.208
WHAT, WAS I NOT SUPPOSED
TO KNOW?

17:37.250 --> 17:40.250
WELL, WE, UH, WE HAD AGREED
NOT TO TELL ANYBODY

17:40.291 --> 17:41.875
UNTIL AFTER THE WEDDING,

17:41.917 --> 17:43.875
BUT STILL,
SHE GOES RUNNING TO YOU.

17:43.917 --> 17:47.208
YOU KNOW, THAT'S JUST...
THAT'S WHO SHE IS.

17:47.250 --> 17:49.166
IT'S WHO SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN.

17:49.208 --> 17:52.083
WELL, HOW DO YOU--
HOW DO YOU GET PAST THAT?

17:53.750 --> 17:55.959
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN.

18:03.417 --> 18:04.875
SO YOU TREATED MS. KENT
FOR PAIN?

18:04.917 --> 18:07.000
NOT JUST PAIN. SHE HAD NAUSEA
ASSOCIATED WITH HER PREGNANCY.

18:07.041 --> 18:08.375
DID YOU
PRESCRIBE HER ANYTHING?

18:08.417 --> 18:10.041
I TOOK A HOLISTIC APPROACH--

18:10.083 --> 18:12.542
ACUPUNCTURE, ACUPRESSURE.

18:12.583 --> 18:15.500
WERE YOU AT ALL CONCERNED
ABOUT HOW SHE WAS RESPONDING?

18:15.542 --> 18:17.500
SPECIFICALLY,
DO YOU FEEL LIKE MS. KENT

18:17.542 --> 18:19.291
WAS GETTING BETTER OR WORSE?

18:19.333 --> 18:22.834
AFTER SHE MISCARRIED, I NEEDED
TO PERFORM AN EMERGENCY D&amp;C.

18:22.875 --> 18:24.291
DID YOU
PERFORM IT IMMEDIATELY?

18:24.333 --> 18:26.291
NO, NOT IMMEDIATELY.

18:26.333 --> 18:28.417
WHY NOT?

18:28.458 --> 18:30.875
ANSWER THE QUESTION, PLEASE.

18:30.917 --> 18:33.250
VIOLET, UH...
(clears throat)

18:33.291 --> 18:35.458
DR. TURNER
FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT

18:35.500 --> 18:38.041
THAT KATIE FULLY COMPREHEND
THE LOSS OF HER BABY

18:38.083 --> 18:40.083
BEFORE THE PROCEDURE.

18:40.125 --> 18:43.917
AND WHAT HAPPENED
AS A RESULT OF THE DELAY?

18:43.959 --> 18:47.291
KATIE WENT INTO SEPTIC SHOCK.

18:47.333 --> 18:50.250
BUT SHE CAME THROUGH
JUST FINE.

18:50.291 --> 18:53.709
AND YOU BELIEVE IT WAS MEDICALLY
APPROPRIATE TO HAVE WAITED?

18:53.750 --> 18:55.125
YES, KATIE WAS--

18:55.166 --> 18:57.083
I... UM,
VIOLET CALMED HER DOWN,

18:57.125 --> 18:59.667
AND THEN I DID THE D&amp;C.

18:59.709 --> 19:02.083
AND HOW DID DR. TURNER
CALM HER DOWN?

19:02.125 --> 19:04.083
SHE RELATED THE EXPERIENCES
OF HER OWN PREGNANCY.

19:04.125 --> 19:06.709
IT WAS A WAY OF BONDING,
AND IT WORKED.

19:06.750 --> 19:09.041
AND HOW EXACTLY DO YOU KNOW
WHAT WAS SAID

19:09.083 --> 19:11.041
DURING KATIE'S THERAPY SESSION
WITH DR. TURNER?

19:11.083 --> 19:13.583
UH, I DON'T KNOW SPECIFICS,

19:13.625 --> 19:15.875
BUT OUR PRACTICE
IS COOPERATIVE.

19:15.917 --> 19:19.041
DOCTORS OFTEN DISCUSS
THEIR CASES WITH EACH OTHER.

19:19.083 --> 19:20.917
INCLUDING MATTERS NOT RELEVANT

19:20.959 --> 19:22.917
TO THEIR SPECIFIC AREAS
OF RESPONSIBILITY

19:22.959 --> 19:24.417
TO THOSE PATIENTS?

19:24.458 --> 19:26.417
IS THAT REALLY THE ETHIC
OF YOUR PRACTICE?

19:26.458 --> 19:28.417
WELL, NOW YOU'RE MAKING US
SOUND LIKE GOSSIPS.

19:28.458 --> 19:30.750
THEN LET ME CLARIFY
MY QUESTION.

19:30.792 --> 19:33.041
DOES DR. TURNER EVER SHARE
THE PERSONAL DETAILS

19:33.083 --> 19:34.709
OF HER PATIENTS WITH YOU,

19:34.750 --> 19:37.041
EVEN WHEN
YOU'RE NOT TREATING THEM?

19:37.083 --> 19:40.208
ONLY WHEN IT'S THERAPEUTICALLY
BENEFICIAL TO THE PATIENT.

19:40.250 --> 19:43.208
CAN YOU PLEASE LIST THE NAMES
OF ALL OTHER PATIENTS

19:43.250 --> 19:45.834
WITH WHOM DR. TURNER SHARED
SUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION?

19:45.875 --> 19:47.875
(pen thuds)

19:53.000 --> 19:54.959
SO YOU GOT NOWHERE?

19:55.000 --> 19:56.542
ON THE CONTRARY.

19:56.583 --> 19:59.041
AN HOUR IN THE LOBBY
WAS VERY INFORMATIVE.

19:59.083 --> 20:01.250
IT'S LIKE A COLLEGE DORM
FOR SEPTUAGENARIANS.

20:01.291 --> 20:03.041
EVERYONE INTO EVERYONE
ELSE'S BUSINESS.

20:03.083 --> 20:04.625
NOT UNLIKE THIS PRACTICE.

20:04.667 --> 20:08.041
(sighs) I ASKED AROUND. MARION
HAD A GOOD FRIEND NAMED WALTER.

20:08.083 --> 20:10.333
HE DIED OF A HEART ATTACK
A FEW WEEKS AGO.
WELL, SO MAYBE THAT'S IT.

20:10.375 --> 20:13.041
THAT'S WHY SHE'S BEEN GIVING UP
AND NOT TAKING CARE OF HERSELF.

20:13.083 --> 20:17.041
SHE'S JUST GRIEVING.
MM-HMM. SHE IS.
BUT WHEN YOU GET TO HER AGE,

20:17.083 --> 20:19.041
LOSS IS
A MUCH MORE COMMON OCCURRENCE.

20:19.083 --> 20:22.041
AND I THINK THE BEST WAY
TO DEAL WITH IT IS THERAPY.

20:22.083 --> 20:24.875
MM. MOST ELDERLY PATIENTS
ARE RESISTANT

20:24.917 --> 20:27.667
TO THE STANDARD TREATMENT
OF MEDS AND TALK THERAPY.

20:27.709 --> 20:30.458
AND FRANKLY, AT MARION'S AGE,
SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE LUXURY

20:30.500 --> 20:32.458
OF SPENDING FIVE YEARS
ON YOUR COUCH,

20:32.500 --> 20:35.041
ESPECIALLY WHEN ALL HER PAIN
CAN BE ERADICATED

20:35.083 --> 20:36.458
WITH ONE PROCEDURE.

20:36.500 --> 20:38.458
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR PSYCHIATRIC DEGREE.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.458
WHERE--WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?
OH, SNARK AWAY.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.834
PRETTY SOON, YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO GET ONE OUT OF A CEREAL BOX.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.458
WITH THE ADVENT
OF PSYCHOSURGERIES

20:44.500 --> 20:46.458
AND NEW
PSYCOPHARMACEUTICALS,

20:46.500 --> 20:48.917
YOUR DEGREE
IS BECOMING OBSOLETE.
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

20:48.959 --> 20:51.500
YOU DON'T EVEN WORK
FOR THE PRACTICE ANYMORE.
OH, I'M HERE FOR HER.

20:51.542 --> 20:54.583
OKAY, TH-THIS
IS NOT PRODUCTIVE.
NO, IT ISN'T,
BUT YOU'RE BEING MYOPIC.

20:54.625 --> 20:57.041
THE BEST THING FOR MARION
IS THE GAMMA KNIFE SURGERY.

20:57.083 --> 20:59.875
WELL, SHE DOESN'T AGREE,
AND NEITHER DO I.

28:37.375 --> 28:39.333
(laughs) JEROME HAD
THE SAME BRASH CONFIDENCE.

28:39.375 --> 28:41.041
WH-WHEN YOU LOST HIM--

28:41.083 --> 28:44.041
I CAN'T IMAGINE SPENDING
HALF A CENTURY WITH SOMEONE

28:44.083 --> 28:47.041
AND THEN HAVING TO GO ON,
BUT YOU DID, FOR YEARS.

28:47.083 --> 28:49.041
AND ACCORDING TO DR. BENNETT,
YOU THRIVED,

28:49.083 --> 28:52.041
WHICH LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT
IF YOU CAN GET OVER JEROME,

28:52.083 --> 28:55.166
YOU CAN GET OVER WALTER, TOO.

28:55.208 --> 28:57.792

ON THE GAME HAVEN'T CHANGED

I WAS HERE.

BEFORE YOU STOPPED?

29:04.083 --> 29:06.709
WALTER.

29:06.750 --> 29:08.792
HE WAS MY FRIEND.

29:08.834 --> 29:10.834
OH, WE TALKED...

29:10.875 --> 29:13.583
ABOUT OUR SPOUSES,
ABOUT OUR LIVES.

29:13.625 --> 29:16.834
WE BOTH LOVED TO PLAY SCRABBLE,
ALMOST EVERY DAY.

29:16.875 --> 29:18.458
THAT SOUNDS NICE.

WITHOUT JEROME,

THAT'S OKAY, MARION.

I JUST COULDN'T.

TO GET OUT.

29:58.083 --> 30:00.166

I WAS CHEATING ON JEROME.

30:10.083 --> 30:13.875

WALTER WILL NEVER KNOW.

30:13.917 --> 30:16.000

I LOVED HIM.

FROM YOU FOR A LOT OF HOURS.

39:50.083 --> 39:52.041
"GONE TO VEGAS.
ENJOY THE FOOD.

39:52.083 --> 39:54.041
DON'T WAIT UP."

39:54.083 --> 39:57.500
SO THEY'RE GONNA
GET MARRIED WITHOUT US.
DO YOU BLAME THEM?

39:57.542 --> 40:00.500
I NEED A DRINK.
WE'RE COMING WITH YOU.

40:00.542 --> 40:03.500
UH, I MAY BOW OUT AS WELL.

40:03.542 --> 40:05.792
I'M WITH YOU.
WAIT, WAIT. UH,
BEFORE EVERYBODY LEAVES,

40:05.834 --> 40:07.083
I, UM...

40:07.125 --> 40:09.458
I JUST WANT TO SAY,
I'M SORRY.

40:09.500 --> 40:11.458
I-I--YOU HAVE TO KNOW
THAT I DIDN'T MEAN

40:11.500 --> 40:13.458
TO MAKE THIS HARD
ON ANY OF YOU.

40:13.500 --> 40:15.583
AND I JUST--I HAD NO IDEA.

40:15.625 --> 40:18.583
SO JUST SO YOU KNOW, I-I SPOKE
TO THE MEDICAL BOARD TODAY

40:18.625 --> 40:21.500
AND, UH, ANSWERED
ALL THEIR QUESTIONS.

40:21.542 --> 40:24.041
UM, BUT I DIDN'T APOLOGIZE
FOR WHAT I WROTE,

40:24.083 --> 40:26.250
BECAUSE WHAT I WROTE REFLECTS

40:26.291 --> 40:29.291
WHO WE ARE AND THE KIND
OF PRACTICE THAT WE HAVE.

40:29.333 --> 40:32.291
WE ARE FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES
WHO RELY ON EACH OTHER

40:32.333 --> 40:35.291
TO HELP OUR PATIENTS,
AND I AM PROUD OF US.

40:35.333 --> 40:38.333
SO THEY SAID THEY'D, UH,
GET BACK TO ME WITH A DECISION,

40:38.375 --> 40:42.083
BUT THEY DIDN'T SAY WHEN,
SO... THERE YOU HAVE IT.

40:42.125 --> 40:44.125
OKAY.

40:44.166 --> 40:47.458
(Amelia) WELL, WE'RE ALL HERE.
WE MIGHT AS WELL CELEBRATE.
