TV REPORTER: <i>In a shocking development,</i>

02:17.954 --> 02:20.215
<i>controversial celebrity defense
attorney Jules Caffrey</i>

02:20.217 --> 02:23.485
has been arrested for the murder
of his fiancée, Lauren Wilson.

02:23.487 --> 02:25.253
Of course, Caffrey first
garnered national attention

02:25.255 --> 02:26.588
15 years ago,

02:26.590 --> 02:28.290
<i>when he won the landmark
Abel Alcindor case.</i>

02:28.292 --> 02:30.759
In the years since, Caffrey has defended

02:30.761 --> 02:33.428
<i>a number of infamous criminal clients,</i>

02:33.430 --> 02:34.896
<i>including a long list of celebrities.</i>

02:34.898 --> 02:37.833
Jules Caffrey is a successful
black man in America.

02:37.835 --> 02:39.501
Of course they're going after him.

02:39.503 --> 02:41.670
There's only one JC I'd pray to
if I got in trouble:

02:41.672 --> 02:44.473
Jules Caffrey. The guy's a legend.

02:44.475 --> 02:46.441
He's scum. He deserves to go to prison

02:46.443 --> 02:47.776
just like any other killer.

02:47.778 --> 02:49.978
I think it's pretty clear
we have a rock solid case

02:49.980 --> 02:51.813
against Jules Caffrey.

02:51.815 --> 02:53.615
Fingerprints, DNA evidence,

02:53.617 --> 02:56.485
and a key eyewitness
that all link Mr. Caffrey

02:56.487 --> 02:58.253
to the murder of his fiancée.

02:58.255 --> 03:00.455
JC cannot talk his way out of this one.

03:00.457 --> 03:02.257
He is going to prison.

03:02.259 --> 03:04.059
(horns honking)

03:04.061 --> 03:06.528
BENNY: Whoa, Bull.

03:06.530 --> 03:09.531
Bull, look. Ooh, purple tank, 4:00.

03:09.533 --> 03:11.900
She's checking you out, my friend.

03:11.902 --> 03:14.336
You gotta see this, Bull. Look closer.

03:14.338 --> 03:15.737
Purple tank has a wedding ring.

03:19.176 --> 03:20.408
Although, that was a valiant attempt

03:20.410 --> 03:21.743
at trying to distract me.

03:22.579 --> 03:24.713
(groans)

03:24.715 --> 03:26.581
Well,

03:26.583 --> 03:29.251
you bet me twice in a row,
I had to try something.

03:29.253 --> 03:32.587
Next drink's on you.

03:32.589 --> 03:34.124
Yes.

03:35.497 --> 03:36.928
Look what I found.

03:36.930 --> 03:39.160
A cupcake for my cupcake. Oh...

03:39.162 --> 03:40.662
Wes.

03:40.664 --> 03:42.998
Computer nerd humor. Nice.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.433
GAYLE KING (on TV): ...and now,
he's fighting to clear his own name.

03:45.435 --> 03:46.868
Please welcome Jules Caffrey.

03:46.870 --> 03:48.770
CHUNK: Jules Caffrey on <i> Gayle King?</i>

03:48.772 --> 03:50.772
Now this should be entertaining.

03:50.774 --> 03:52.173
KING: What do you have
to say about that?

03:52.175 --> 03:54.109
The charges are a complete
fabrication, Gayle.

03:54.111 --> 03:57.445
Lauren and I were in love.

03:57.447 --> 03:59.781
These vindictive attacks by the
NYPD and the DA's office

03:59.783 --> 04:01.850
is an insult to me, to Lauren

04:01.852 --> 04:03.485
and to the entire justice system.

04:03.487 --> 04:04.786
Confident body language,

04:04.788 --> 04:06.254
expressive, emotional.

04:06.256 --> 04:07.722
Knows how to play to an audience.

04:07.724 --> 04:10.458
- Not to me.
- MARISSA: Says the former prosecutor

04:10.460 --> 04:12.627
who lost to him how many times?

04:12.629 --> 04:14.262
- CHUNK: Wow.
- (Bull chuckles)

04:14.264 --> 04:15.630
KING: So how do you intend
to prove your innocence?

04:15.632 --> 04:18.067
Well, when the entire system
is trying to bring you down,

04:18.069 --> 04:19.307
then you hire the best.

04:19.309 --> 04:21.136
That's why I've brought on
the world-renowned

04:21.137 --> 04:23.438
trial consultant Dr. Jason Bull.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.273
What the hell is he talking about?

04:25.275 --> 04:28.243
KING: Dr. Jason Bull is
a highly regarded psychologist,

04:28.245 --> 04:31.413
widely considered a pioneer
in the field of trial science.

04:31.415 --> 04:33.648
But let's talk about the facts
of this particular case.

04:33.650 --> 04:36.384
Why didn't you tell us
we took on Jules Caffrey?

04:36.386 --> 04:37.919
Because we didn't.

04:43.560 --> 04:46.161
(reporters clamoring)

04:46.163 --> 04:48.330
(Jules chuckling)

04:49.466 --> 04:51.800
The great Dr. Jason Bull, everybody.

04:51.802 --> 04:53.068
My partner.

04:53.070 --> 04:54.502
BULL: Jules Caffrey.

04:54.504 --> 04:56.805
You've got a lot of fans.

04:56.807 --> 04:58.907
I'm not exactly one of them.

04:58.909 --> 05:01.576
You don't get my help by
lying about hiring me.

05:01.578 --> 05:03.979
(laughing): It got you here, didn't it?

05:03.981 --> 05:07.148
(laughing): Yeah. Well, so
would a text with a smiley face emoji.

05:07.150 --> 05:08.617
You pull that crap again
and I'll be on <i> Gayle King</i>

05:08.619 --> 05:10.185
saying how you did hire me,

05:10.187 --> 05:12.287
but I quit, 'cause I couldn't believe

05:12.289 --> 05:15.457
- how guilty I found you.
- (laughs)

05:15.459 --> 05:17.926
Wait, wait. I'm not guilty.

05:17.928 --> 05:19.394
Just hear me out.

05:20.864 --> 05:23.198
Thank you, guys.

05:23.200 --> 05:24.532
Thank you so much.

05:25.147 --> 05:26.801
I see.

05:26.803 --> 05:28.336
Well, renovations can cause

05:28.338 --> 05:30.372
a lot of tension in a relationship.

05:30.374 --> 05:31.973
Eh, it's Lauren's idea.

05:31.975 --> 05:35.243
She wants everything to be Tiffany blue.

05:35.245 --> 05:37.479
She says it'll calm me down.

05:37.481 --> 05:39.414
She “says” that?

05:39.416 --> 05:42.417
I, uh, I meant, uh, “she said that”"

05:45.255 --> 05:47.756
SHELLEY (on TV):
Jules Caffrey is a jealous,

05:47.758 --> 05:51.559
controlling man who could not
stand to be disobeyed.

05:51.561 --> 05:54.329
The people of New York owe it
to Lauren, and to all the women

05:54.331 --> 05:56.898
who live in fear of their
abusers, to stand up

05:56.900 --> 06:00.101
and say enough is enough.

06:00.910 --> 06:02.637
She's everywhere.

06:02.639 --> 06:04.506
This whole thing is a witch hunt.

06:04.508 --> 06:05.840
I even set up a tip line

06:05.842 --> 06:06.908
to help them look for the real killer.

06:06.910 --> 06:08.176
BULL: Any leads?

06:08.178 --> 06:10.112
None that the police will follow-up on.

06:10.114 --> 06:11.713
They just want me.

06:12.365 --> 06:13.709
Vindictive bastards.

06:13.711 --> 06:15.750
So tell me, Jules.

06:15.752 --> 06:17.318
What's your theory?

06:17.320 --> 06:18.720
I'm sure you have one.

06:18.722 --> 06:22.724
It's possible that
Lauren had a fling with someone.

06:22.726 --> 06:23.892
A fling?

06:23.894 --> 06:25.260
Wow.

06:25.262 --> 06:26.561
That's not the ideal fiancée.

06:26.563 --> 06:28.196
It was recent.

06:28.198 --> 06:29.966
A week before all of this,

06:29.968 --> 06:32.701
she was hiding something. I...

06:32.703 --> 06:34.518
Phone calls she didn't want me to hear.

06:35.265 --> 06:37.472
I came to surprise her at the
rehearsal, she wasn't there.

06:37.474 --> 06:38.898
Never showed up.

06:39.543 --> 06:41.376
Well, she was 25.

06:43.146 --> 06:46.658
And 20 years younger than I am.

06:47.068 --> 06:49.517
She gets a lot of attention.

06:49.519 --> 06:52.342
And I wasn't always around, so I...

06:54.024 --> 06:55.590
I don't know.

06:56.637 --> 06:58.426
Looking at your wall here,

06:58.428 --> 07:00.628
one of these plaques kind of stands out.

07:00.630 --> 07:05.322
The New York Foundation for
Mankind Humanitarian Award,

07:05.324 --> 07:07.669
Jules Caffrey, 1999.

07:09.372 --> 07:11.064
Where'd that guy go?

07:11.775 --> 07:15.343
He has three expensive exes.

07:16.480 --> 07:18.321
Choices.

07:19.082 --> 07:22.050
Now I got a question for you,
Mr. Trial Consultant.

07:22.052 --> 07:23.718
Do you believe in justice?

07:23.720 --> 07:26.621
Because you're looking
at an innocent man.

07:28.158 --> 07:30.692
BENNY: <i>Why would you take the case?</i>

07:30.694 --> 07:32.227
'Cause he didn't do it.

07:32.229 --> 07:33.561
BENNY: And you can tell that

07:33.563 --> 07:35.797
just by meeting him once.

07:35.799 --> 07:38.933
Jules speaks about Lauren
in the present tense.

07:38.935 --> 07:41.136
The murder was three months ago.

07:41.138 --> 07:43.438
It's as if he can't believe she's dead,

07:43.440 --> 07:46.107
and killers aren't in denial.
CHUNK: I'm with Bull.

07:46.109 --> 07:48.543
I mean, look, the guy's theatrical.

07:48.545 --> 07:50.311
He's a showman in every way,

07:50.313 --> 07:51.846
but he's also done a lot of good.

07:51.848 --> 07:53.114
I don't believe he did it.

07:53.116 --> 07:54.949
The evidence, the witness,
this voice mail.

07:54.951 --> 07:58.019
LAUREN (on voice mail):
I know you're angry, but please,

07:58.021 --> 07:59.322
just let me explain.

07:59.324 --> 08:01.189
Hear that? She's scared.

08:01.191 --> 08:03.428
The prosecution is honing in
on their narrative.

08:03.430 --> 08:05.894
Jules was Lauren's sugar daddy.

08:05.896 --> 08:07.762
Rich, powerful, controlling.

08:07.764 --> 08:09.571
Killed her in a jealous rage.

08:09.573 --> 08:11.949
It's true. The mock jurors
hated the Jules and Lauren

08:11.951 --> 08:13.582
May-December romance.

08:13.584 --> 08:15.737
Well, if he was a saint
it would be easy.

08:15.739 --> 08:18.373
- He doesn't even have an attorney.
- BULL: Yeah.

08:18.375 --> 08:19.674
I was thinking about that.

08:19.676 --> 08:21.810
No. No, no, no, no.

08:21.812 --> 08:24.245
Look. Jules' only defense

08:24.247 --> 08:25.847
is that the police want payback.

08:25.849 --> 08:27.582
Come on, Bull. I-I can't sell that.

08:27.584 --> 08:29.150
And I'd never expect you to.

08:29.152 --> 08:30.852
- (Jules chuckling)
- And that was the day that I realized

08:30.854 --> 08:32.220
I loved Alfredo sauce.

08:32.222 --> 08:33.587
(both chuckling)

08:33.590 --> 08:34.923
Hello, trial consultants.

08:34.924 --> 08:36.624
Ready to get to work?

08:36.626 --> 08:37.826
BULL: Team.

08:37.828 --> 08:39.861
Meet our client, Jules Caffrey.

08:39.863 --> 08:42.931
And the man who's gonna represent him...

08:42.933 --> 08:45.867
Jules Caffrey.

08:49.172 --> 08:51.406
You want me to defend myself?

08:52.309 --> 08:54.542
Seems to me you're the only one who can.

08:59.416 --> 09:06.012
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

09:07.987 --> 09:09.698
CABLE: I cross-referenced
the last six months

09:09.723 --> 09:11.322
of Lauren's texts,
phone calls and e-mails.

09:11.324 --> 09:12.991
All her top pings are basketball people.

09:12.993 --> 09:14.459
Any family, exes or whatnot?

09:14.461 --> 09:16.427
None. She's a foster kid
that bounced around a lot.

09:16.429 --> 09:17.585
Who were her top two contacts?

09:17.587 --> 09:20.698
Dance squad leader, Kelvin Li,
and power forward, Grant Combs.

09:20.700 --> 09:22.467
Hmm. Looks like Kelvin held a lot

09:22.469 --> 09:24.636
of private dance sessions
with Lauren. And Grant,

09:24.638 --> 09:25.715
just look at him.

09:25.717 --> 09:27.872
I know the squad's wardrobe
person from my days at <i> Vogue.</i>

09:27.874 --> 09:29.274
I'm sure she's got some intel.

09:29.276 --> 09:30.775
Let's see what it is.

09:34.114 --> 09:35.813
SHELLEY: Okay, so I want
to offer you a gift,

09:35.815 --> 09:37.181
because you're my friend,

09:37.183 --> 09:39.884
and because I want to see
The Jules Show canceled,

09:39.886 --> 09:42.847
and this master of media
manipulation behind bars.

09:42.849 --> 09:44.322
So...

09:44.324 --> 09:47.225
man one, 25 years.

09:47.227 --> 09:49.093
Parole in 15.

09:49.095 --> 09:50.561
We're going to trial, Shelley.

09:50.563 --> 09:52.300
Wait a minute. Are you defending him?

09:52.302 --> 09:53.998
Am I going up against you in court?

09:54.000 --> 09:54.999
No.

09:55.001 --> 09:56.968
He's going pro se.

09:56.970 --> 09:58.369
(laughing): Oh, my God.

09:58.371 --> 10:00.104
You know, “He who represents himself

10:00.106 --> 10:01.472
has a fool for a client”"

10:01.474 --> 10:02.907
You know who said that, right?

10:02.909 --> 10:04.175
Uh, yeah. Abe Lincoln, you,

10:04.177 --> 10:05.610
pretty much everyone who studies law.

10:05.612 --> 10:06.844
You know what?

10:06.846 --> 10:08.379
I don't even want to offer you a deal.

10:08.381 --> 10:10.248
Everyone knows that Jules
is a traveling circus,

10:10.250 --> 10:12.083
and he's gonna make Bull his clown.

10:12.085 --> 10:13.484
Well, then we'll make sure to keep

10:13.486 --> 10:14.953
the coulrophobics off the jury.

10:14.955 --> 10:17.021
People with an
irrational fear of clowns.

10:17.023 --> 10:18.056
I know what it means.

10:18.058 --> 10:19.791
I am one and it's not irrational.

10:19.793 --> 10:22.660
Unlike having Jules
defend himself in court.

10:22.662 --> 10:25.763
Hey. Don't get too confident, okay?

10:25.765 --> 10:27.565
Bull's tactics tend to pay off.

10:27.567 --> 10:29.363
I can't wait.

10:31.471 --> 10:33.237
(sighs)

10:33.239 --> 10:35.974
Statistically, black jurors
are more sympathetic

10:35.976 --> 10:38.810
to black defendants,
especially in celebrity cases.

10:38.812 --> 10:40.645
I want to shut that down right now.

10:40.647 --> 10:42.880
I don't want the perception
to be that I got off

10:42.882 --> 10:44.082
because of a black jury.

10:44.084 --> 10:46.651
- This is about me being innocent.
- BULL: Good.

10:46.653 --> 10:48.619
Because we actually found in your case

10:48.621 --> 10:50.955
race isn't the primary factor.

10:50.957 --> 10:52.924
Your best jurors tend to be those

10:52.926 --> 10:55.026
with low NPI scores.

10:55.028 --> 10:57.695
That's Narcissistic Personality
Inventory.

10:57.697 --> 10:58.830
So doormats.

10:58.832 --> 11:01.132
People with no ego. Why?

11:01.660 --> 11:02.800
What's my score?

11:02.802 --> 11:04.869
On a scale from one to 40...

11:04.871 --> 11:07.638
a 38. Our ideal juror
would be under ten.

11:07.640 --> 11:09.807
(chuckles) Call me whatever you want.

11:09.809 --> 11:10.975
But the people know

11:10.977 --> 11:13.044
when Jules Caffrey speaks,

11:13.046 --> 11:15.346
it's the truth. It's also illeism.

11:15.348 --> 11:16.581
You really like referring to yourself

11:16.583 --> 11:17.849
in the third person, don't you, Jules?

11:17.851 --> 11:19.550
- A lot of people do that.
- The only ones

11:19.552 --> 11:21.719
who do it more than you
are Donald Trump and Elmo.

11:21.721 --> 11:23.755
Okay, which is why our focus will be

11:23.757 --> 11:25.590
on people who don't like high-drama.

11:25.592 --> 11:28.092
Pageants. Spectacles of any kind.

11:28.094 --> 11:29.894
- Canadians, essentially.
- (chuckles)

11:29.896 --> 11:32.497
No, no, no. You guys
are eliminating my fan base.

11:32.499 --> 11:34.699
This is wrong.

11:34.701 --> 11:36.501
We need the opposite.

11:36.503 --> 11:38.636
We need people who can be
swept away by emotion

11:38.638 --> 11:40.805
and people who know

11:40.807 --> 11:43.074
that I am the thorn of justice

11:43.076 --> 11:44.842
in this system's underbelly.

11:44.844 --> 11:47.245
That works for Jules Caffrey,
the defense attorney,

11:47.247 --> 11:49.914
not Jules Caffrey, the defendant.

11:49.916 --> 11:52.116
Prosecutor's narrative is

11:52.118 --> 11:56.020
that you are a jealous,
jilted and vengeful lover.

11:56.022 --> 11:58.556
But this jury is gonna
buy into reasonable doubt

11:58.558 --> 12:01.526
because Shelley doesn't have
the facts to convince them.

You really think juror number
one is gonna be a problem?

18:11.883 --> 18:13.215
(chuckles)

18:13.217 --> 18:14.850
Oh, boy. Kendall, the fangirl?

18:14.852 --> 18:16.252
Yeah, she's gonna be a problem.

18:16.254 --> 18:18.220
She's going to enjoy every
minute of this trial

18:18.222 --> 18:19.755
and every look you give her,

18:19.757 --> 18:21.023
but she's gonna find you guilty

18:21.025 --> 18:23.726
because Shelley's gonna convince
her that you're abusive.

18:23.728 --> 18:26.362
That is the prosecution's game plan.

18:26.364 --> 18:29.465
Now wake up. Start listening to me.

18:30.174 --> 18:32.607
Yo. Talked to internal affairs.

18:32.703 --> 18:34.503
The officers on Lauren's
murder are clean.

18:34.505 --> 18:37.439
They double gloved, dotted
every “I,” crossed every “T”"

18:37.441 --> 18:38.974
No one wanted to make a procedural error

18:38.976 --> 18:40.174
that could cost them a conviction.

18:40.176 --> 18:41.377
We're gonna have to find the guy

18:41.379 --> 18:42.878
Jules thinks his fiancée
was sleeping with.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.613
ALLIE: Special delivery.

18:44.615 --> 18:46.282
- Ooh.
- (grunts)

18:46.284 --> 18:47.650
Hi.

18:48.553 --> 18:50.452
(gasps)

18:50.454 --> 18:51.720
Oh.

18:51.722 --> 18:53.722
(squeals) (chuckles)

18:53.724 --> 18:56.125
It's a giant purple cat thing.

18:56.127 --> 18:57.760
It's Rubio Shoyra

18:57.762 --> 19:00.262
from the <i> Tokyo Spiritchasers</i>
shojo manga.

19:00.264 --> 19:01.931
- It's from Wes.
- Cute.

19:01.933 --> 19:04.466
I'm gonna not pretend
that I understood that.

19:04.468 --> 19:05.401
Is it Japanese?

19:05.403 --> 19:07.102
- Yeah.
- And the second gift

19:07.104 --> 19:09.004
- from Wes this week.
- (giggles) I know.

19:09.006 --> 19:10.375
Oh.

19:11.042 --> 19:11.974
What?

19:11.976 --> 19:13.546
- Nothing.
- No, really, supermodel,

19:13.548 --> 19:15.844
- what are you trying to say?
- Well, are you mad at him?

19:15.846 --> 19:17.646
No. Why?

19:17.648 --> 19:18.981
Well, you know guys.
They don't give gifts

19:18.983 --> 19:20.618
“just because.”

19:20.620 --> 19:23.018
I actually don't know guys.
They're a complete mystery.

19:23.020 --> 19:24.687
Trust me, Wes is no player.

19:24.689 --> 19:27.156
You know what? You guys
are the behavior experts.

19:27.158 --> 19:28.457
I'm sure the modeling world's

19:28.459 --> 19:30.726
totally different. (chuckles)

19:30.728 --> 19:33.462
So just... Maybe I'll take this.

19:33.464 --> 19:34.758
(clears throat)

19:36.267 --> 19:37.633
CHUNK: <i>We have a new suspect.</i>

19:37.635 --> 19:39.268
Angela Miles.

19:39.270 --> 19:41.937
Finally made it up to captain
of the squad in Bronx City

19:41.939 --> 19:43.772
and then lost it when
Lauren came on board.

19:43.774 --> 19:45.908
And got back on top after Lauren died.

19:45.910 --> 19:47.476
Doesn't quite seem enough to kill for.

19:47.478 --> 19:48.677
Have you ever met a cheerleader?

19:48.679 --> 19:50.954
- Have Cable do a deep dive on Angela.
- (phone buzzes)

19:50.956 --> 19:53.048
Pay her a visit, see if you can
ruffle her pompoms.

19:53.050 --> 19:54.216
What is it, Danny?

19:54.218 --> 19:55.551
- Turn on the TV.
- (crowd cheering)

19:55.553 --> 19:57.419
This ought to be interesting.

19:58.522 --> 20:01.023
JULES: I want to thank you
all for gathering here.

20:01.025 --> 20:03.292
Not for me, but for Lauren.

20:03.294 --> 20:05.160
I followed him to Washington Square

20:05.162 --> 20:06.362
after the court let out.

20:06.364 --> 20:08.998
The NYPD and the district attorney

20:09.000 --> 20:11.367
want to bring Jules Caffrey down.

20:11.369 --> 20:13.769
They want to harm Jules Caffrey,

20:13.771 --> 20:17.039
and they want to bury Jules Caffrey.

20:17.041 --> 20:19.141
(scoffs) I hate the third person thing.

20:19.143 --> 20:20.628
This is gonna polarize our jury.

20:20.630 --> 20:23.579
Yeah. It's time
for Bull to shut this down.

20:23.581 --> 20:27.082
CROWD (chanting): Jules! Jules!
Jules! Jules! Jules!

20:27.084 --> 20:28.817
(horns blaring)

20:28.819 --> 20:31.453
JULES: Why haven't the NYPD
looked into my tip line?

20:31.455 --> 20:33.389
Why aren't they looking

20:33.391 --> 20:34.857
for the real murderer?

20:34.859 --> 20:36.291
We need answers.

20:36.293 --> 20:38.394
We need accountability.

20:38.396 --> 20:40.062
We need justice.

20:40.064 --> 20:41.597
Giordano's gonna hammer us with this.

20:41.599 --> 20:43.098
- Justice for Lauren.
- What is Jules thinking?

20:43.100 --> 20:44.967
- Justice for Jules.
- CROWD (chanting): Justice for Jules.

20:44.969 --> 20:47.182
He's trying his case in the
court of public opinion.

20:47.184 --> 20:49.009
Justice for Lauren

20:49.011 --> 20:50.472
and justice for Jules.

20:50.474 --> 20:51.774
(chanting): Justice for Jules.

20:51.776 --> 20:55.310
Justice for Jules.

20:55.312 --> 20:56.945
BULL: Marissa, are the mirror
jurors watching this?

20:56.947 --> 20:59.148
Like it's the fourth quarter
of the Super Bowl.

20:59.150 --> 21:00.683
And they were specifically instructed

21:00.685 --> 21:02.618
not to follow any news about Jules,

21:02.620 --> 21:04.119
just like the real jurors.

21:04.121 --> 21:05.788
This is Jules taking the stand.

21:05.790 --> 21:08.791
Right there, my friends, right there

21:08.793 --> 21:11.026
is a tireless defender

21:11.028 --> 21:12.795
for just causes.

21:12.797 --> 21:14.263
Dr. Jason Bull.

21:14.265 --> 21:15.664
(cheering, applause)

21:16.967 --> 21:18.767
Come up.

21:19.970 --> 21:23.105
Bull, you are not
going to believe this...

21:23.107 --> 21:25.501
Jules' stunt isn't hurting him,
it's helping him.

21:25.815 --> 21:27.042
Big time.

21:30.381 --> 21:32.846
Look, I know this is not
what you wanted.

21:33.384 --> 21:34.817
Well, it's not normal,

21:34.819 --> 21:36.752
but then again, you're not normal.

21:36.754 --> 21:37.953
(chuckles)

21:37.955 --> 21:39.755
Ladies and gentlemen,

21:40.212 --> 21:41.690
I am here today

21:41.692 --> 21:43.025
because Jules Caffrey

21:43.027 --> 21:44.226
is an innocent man.

21:44.228 --> 21:46.795
(cheering, whooping)

21:46.797 --> 21:49.031
Yeah, we're not in Canada anymore.

21:49.033 --> 21:51.897
CROWD (chanting): Justice for Jules!
Justice for Jules!

21:55.535 --> 21:58.301
You made a genuine emotional
connection with the jury.

21:58.348 --> 21:59.881
- The crowd.
- (chuckles)

21:59.883 --> 22:01.616
I told you your strategy was wrong.

22:01.618 --> 22:03.919
Even your low-drama jurors got swept up

22:03.921 --> 22:05.620
in the moral authority of my cause.

22:05.622 --> 22:08.390
Okay, first of all,
you're a case, not a cause.

22:08.392 --> 22:09.891
And my way would have worked, too.

22:09.893 --> 22:11.460
So “wrong” is the wrong word.

22:11.462 --> 22:13.228
Okay. Let's focus

22:13.230 --> 22:16.498
on Shelley's next move, shall we?

22:16.500 --> 22:18.033
You know she's bringing out your exes

22:18.035 --> 22:20.902
to show that you're possessive,
temperamental and jealous.

22:20.904 --> 22:22.804
Someone who'd go into a violent rage

22:22.806 --> 22:25.006
if they found out their fiancée
was cheating on them.

22:25.008 --> 22:26.808
Here's how you proceed.

22:26.810 --> 22:28.844
SHELLEY: Please state your name
and your relationship to the defendant.

22:28.846 --> 22:30.112
Ginny Caffrey.

22:30.114 --> 22:31.847
I was Jules' first wife.

22:31.849 --> 22:33.748
We were married for five years.

22:33.750 --> 22:34.749
Leslie Caffrey.

22:34.751 --> 22:36.218
I'm the second wife.

22:36.220 --> 22:37.619
Lasted four years.

22:37.621 --> 22:39.955
Claudine Caffrey. I was three and three:

22:39.957 --> 22:41.323
third wife, three years.

22:41.325 --> 22:42.591
Notice how Jules gets older

22:42.593 --> 22:44.025
and his wives always stay the same age?

22:44.027 --> 22:47.362
Once a sugar daddy,
always a sugar daddy.

22:47.364 --> 22:48.830
BULL: <i>Why do you think</i>

22:48.832 --> 22:50.645
your marriages ended?

22:51.802 --> 22:54.836
I was an attentive husband,

22:54.838 --> 22:58.073
but I was often preoccupied
with my clients.

22:58.075 --> 22:59.841
I can get stressed.

22:59.843 --> 23:02.777
Miss some birthdays,
weddings, anniversaries.

23:03.175 --> 23:05.080
Was Jules ever violent around you?

23:05.082 --> 23:06.781
He could be, sometimes.

23:06.783 --> 23:08.750
He'd get short with me, he'd get angry.

23:08.752 --> 23:09.885
SHELLEY: Anything else?

23:09.887 --> 23:12.154
He'd yell, throw dishes, kick doors.

23:12.156 --> 23:14.756
I called them his adult temper tantrums.

23:14.758 --> 23:16.558
But it was frightening.

23:16.999 --> 23:18.660
Can you describe your ex-husband

23:18.662 --> 23:20.213
in one word?

23:20.631 --> 23:21.696
He was a monster.

23:21.698 --> 23:23.732
- A monster.
- He was a monster.

23:25.335 --> 23:26.568
(computer beeping)

23:26.570 --> 23:28.603
The mirror jurors' biometrics
are through the roof.

23:28.605 --> 23:30.272
They're upset, Bull.

23:30.274 --> 23:31.306
Don't worry yet.

23:31.308 --> 23:32.707
If he wins back the exes,

23:32.709 --> 23:33.975
he wins back the jury.

23:33.977 --> 23:36.811
You're gonna have the rarest
of opportunities:

23:36.813 --> 23:39.848
you're gonna get to
cross-examine your ex-wives

23:39.850 --> 23:42.050
under penalty of perjury.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.452
JULES: <i>Ginny,</i>

23:44.454 --> 23:47.545
were you upset about my ego

23:47.991 --> 23:49.591
or were you upset about my job?

23:49.593 --> 23:50.825
Both.

23:50.827 --> 23:52.917
JULES: I was trying to build a practice,

23:52.919 --> 23:54.996
so I worked late.

23:54.998 --> 23:56.765
- You resented that?
- (chuckles)

23:56.767 --> 23:58.733
I resented you sleeping with Leslie.

23:58.735 --> 24:00.502
JULES: But, Ginny, you

24:00.504 --> 24:02.971
kicked me out of our bed a year earlier.

24:02.973 --> 24:05.173
So is it fair to say that I started

24:05.175 --> 24:07.676
seeing other women
when you stopped seeing me?

24:08.294 --> 24:09.477
Yes.

24:09.479 --> 24:11.613
JULES: And I always said it
wouldn't be fair raising a kid

24:11.615 --> 24:13.402
with my hectic life.

24:13.404 --> 24:14.816
And you agreed, correct?

24:14.818 --> 24:17.152
- I thought you'd change.
- JULES: <i> The red carpets,</i>

24:17.154 --> 24:20.555
the galas, the VIP suites.

24:20.557 --> 24:22.891
I provided a lifestyle.

24:22.893 --> 24:25.327
And you knew
what you were signing up for.

24:25.329 --> 24:26.995
At first.

24:26.997 --> 24:28.797
But then I didn't want that life.

24:28.799 --> 24:30.498
JULES: So it really was you

24:30.500 --> 24:32.633
who changed, not me.

24:33.237 --> 24:35.036
- Yes.
- JULES: <i> And in</i>

24:35.038 --> 24:38.640
all of our time together, did I ever,

24:38.959 --> 24:40.642
ever...

24:40.644 --> 24:42.510
lay a finger on you?

24:42.512 --> 24:43.845
No.

24:43.847 --> 24:45.880
No.

24:45.882 --> 24:47.349
No.

24:47.351 --> 24:48.850
JULES: And when we were together...

24:48.852 --> 24:50.118
with no interruptions...

24:50.697 --> 24:52.287
was it good?

24:53.824 --> 24:55.309
Yes.

24:56.293 --> 24:58.226
It was great.

24:58.228 --> 25:00.195
The best.

25:00.197 --> 25:02.230
JULES: No further questions, Your Honor.

25:02.232 --> 25:04.165
Wow, he actually did it.

25:04.167 --> 25:06.167
BULL: Even Kendall was moved.

25:10.274 --> 25:11.673
♪ ♪

25:11.675 --> 25:13.808
I was devastated when Lauren died.

25:13.810 --> 25:15.277
That's why I took her torch

25:15.279 --> 25:17.479
and led the squad through their grief.

25:17.481 --> 25:19.281
It's what Lauren would have wanted.

25:20.517 --> 25:22.817
You know, it's funny
you should say that.

25:22.819 --> 25:24.819
Your junior year in college,

25:24.821 --> 25:27.289
you pushed another student
off the stage.

25:27.291 --> 25:28.690
That girl

25:28.692 --> 25:30.225
fell, broke her ankle

25:30.227 --> 25:32.294
and had to step down as the lead
in the dance recital.

25:32.296 --> 25:33.862
That's not my fault she couldn't

25:33.864 --> 25:35.830
stick her landing on her grand-jeté.

25:36.967 --> 25:38.099
The school agreed it was an accident.

25:38.101 --> 25:40.669
Good thing you took up <i> her</i> torch, too.

25:40.671 --> 25:42.170
Somebody had to.

25:43.874 --> 25:45.507
Other people's tragedies
seem to work out

25:45.509 --> 25:46.808
really, really well for you.

25:46.810 --> 25:48.877
What you want me to say?

25:48.879 --> 25:50.812
Lauren was a talentless fraud.

25:50.814 --> 25:52.714
I was a nationally- ranked cheerleader.

25:52.716 --> 25:54.582
The closest she ever came
to professional dancing

25:54.584 --> 25:56.217
was a run of <i>The Nutcracker</i>

25:56.219 --> 25:58.053
at a community theater in Indiana.

25:58.055 --> 26:00.221
- Resented her much?
- Yeah.

26:00.223 --> 26:01.289
She slept her way to the top.

26:01.291 --> 26:03.158
I had to work my whole life for this.

26:03.160 --> 26:05.093
Wait. Come on,

26:05.095 --> 26:07.696
you're trying to say that I killed her?

26:07.698 --> 26:10.065
- No, I'm sure you have an alibi.
- Every Sunday,

26:10.067 --> 26:11.466
including the night that she died,

26:11.468 --> 26:14.102
I party at Output. It's a club.

26:14.104 --> 26:15.373
Check it out.

26:17.741 --> 26:19.941
(elevator bell dings)

26:21.445 --> 26:23.345
(sighs)

26:27.584 --> 26:29.784
(clears throat)

26:31.655 --> 26:33.521
That was...

26:33.523 --> 26:35.790
(chuckles) Intense?

26:35.792 --> 26:37.866
Draining?

26:38.495 --> 26:40.418
Hopefully cathartic.

26:42.366 --> 26:45.538
My exes have never
been that open with me.

26:46.203 --> 26:48.859
Felt like we came to an understanding.

26:49.406 --> 26:52.374
It's funny how honesty can do that.

26:53.844 --> 26:55.858
Well, you did good in there.

26:58.215 --> 26:59.714
Yeah.

26:59.716 --> 27:01.748
Let's not do that again.

27:02.219 --> 27:05.407
(crowd shouting angrily)

27:05.409 --> 27:06.855
WOMAN: Stop the abuse!

27:06.857 --> 27:08.056
(angry shouting)

27:08.058 --> 27:09.290
Justice for Lauren!

27:09.292 --> 27:10.859
CROWD (chanting): Not okay!
Justice for Lauren!

27:10.861 --> 27:12.127
What the hell is going on?

27:12.129 --> 27:13.628
(chanting): Not okay!

27:13.630 --> 27:15.630
BULL: That's your jury.

27:15.632 --> 27:17.198
Right on time.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.233
For what?

27:18.235 --> 27:19.701
She wanted to make sure the last thing

27:19.703 --> 27:21.569
these jurors saw before going home

27:21.571 --> 27:24.406
was people protesting your
behavior towards women.

27:24.408 --> 27:26.674
She stole your thunder, Jules.

27:26.676 --> 27:28.643
You're not the only one who's got game.

27:29.846 --> 27:31.246
Good night, gentlemen.

27:31.248 --> 27:34.149
(chanting): Not okay! Not okay!

27:34.151 --> 27:36.492
- Not okay!
- (sighs)

27:42.506 --> 27:44.473
Bull, Shelley's stunt on
the courthouse steps yesterday

27:44.475 --> 27:46.341
turned two more jurors against us.

27:46.343 --> 27:48.110
And this next witness isn't gonna help.

27:48.112 --> 27:50.178
All the mock juries
believed his testimony.

27:50.180 --> 27:52.781
BULL Derek the contractor.

27:52.783 --> 27:54.650
(whispering): That's why
we're gonna leave Derek alone.

27:55.505 --> 27:56.808
Do not cross.

27:56.895 --> 27:58.128
SHELLEY: Mr. Miller,

27:58.130 --> 27:59.830
you were at the defendant's house

27:59.832 --> 28:02.012
the morning Lauren Wilson was murdered.

28:03.054 --> 28:04.354
Can you tell us what happened?

28:04.356 --> 28:05.372
I arrived early

28:05.374 --> 28:07.253
to deliver the material
for the kitchen work.

28:07.255 --> 28:09.192
Ms. Wilson came down the stairs, crying,

28:09.194 --> 28:10.927
and Mr. Caffrey
ran after her, screaming.

28:10.929 --> 28:12.272
SHELLEY: Could you hear
what he was saying?

28:12.274 --> 28:13.763
DEREK: Yes, ma'am. He said he wanted

28:13.765 --> 28:15.480
to know where she was the night before,

28:15.482 --> 28:17.228
who she was with. She said “Nobody,”

28:17.230 --> 28:18.065
and he called her a liar.

28:18.132 --> 28:19.018
MARISSA: Oh, boy, Bull,

28:19.020 --> 28:20.519
the engagement levels are spiking.

28:20.521 --> 28:22.321
This guy's honest, polite.

28:22.323 --> 28:23.556
He's catnip for the jury.

28:23.558 --> 28:25.558
That's why we're gonna leave him alone.

28:25.560 --> 28:27.493
SHELLEY: And then what happened?

28:27.495 --> 28:29.037
Um...

28:30.298 --> 28:32.331
I stepped in, for her sake.
I got Mr. Caffrey

28:32.333 --> 28:33.966
to let go of her arm.

28:33.968 --> 28:34.967
She left the house crying.

28:34.969 --> 28:36.502
SHELLEY: Did the defendant do

28:36.504 --> 28:38.557
or say anything to you after that?

28:38.559 --> 28:39.772
No, ma'am.

28:39.774 --> 28:41.273
But he did punch a wall.

28:42.410 --> 28:43.576
No further questions.

28:44.533 --> 28:46.145
JUDGE: Mr. Caffrey,

28:46.147 --> 28:47.480
any cross?

28:47.482 --> 28:48.714
Uh, no questions, Your Honor.

28:48.716 --> 28:49.915
I need to hear it

28:49.917 --> 28:51.250
from Mr. Caffrey.

28:51.252 --> 28:52.485
Ah.

28:52.949 --> 28:56.155
Well... you know what I want you to do,

28:56.157 --> 28:57.954
but you think you know better

28:57.956 --> 29:01.126
so light yourself on fire,
and I'll watch the show.

29:04.298 --> 29:05.564
Derek,

29:06.113 --> 29:08.400
you said you stepped in

29:08.402 --> 29:10.102
for Lauren's sake.

29:10.104 --> 29:11.270
Did she ask for help?

29:11.272 --> 29:12.371
DEREK: No, sir.

29:12.887 --> 29:14.206
Good.

29:16.415 --> 29:17.872
Were you attracted to her?

29:17.874 --> 29:19.845
DEREK: No. No, sir.

29:19.847 --> 29:21.547
Heart rates are up. Jules is coming off

29:21.549 --> 29:24.049
as an angry jilted lover.
Bull, you need to stop him.

29:24.051 --> 29:26.952
I am not gonna get in front
of that runaway train.

29:26.954 --> 29:29.655
So there's no reason for you
to get involved, correct?

29:29.657 --> 29:31.624
Well, I saw that look in your eye.

29:31.626 --> 29:33.359
I'd seen it before.

29:33.361 --> 29:34.527
I thought you were gonna hurt her.

29:34.529 --> 29:36.729
Admit it: you just wanted to be a hero.

29:36.731 --> 29:39.031
DEREK: If I was a real hero,

29:39.033 --> 29:40.666
I would've stopped you from killing her.

29:40.668 --> 29:42.434
(gallery gasps, mutters)

29:42.436 --> 29:43.869
BULL (whispers): And...

29:43.871 --> 29:45.471
crash.

29:48.976 --> 29:50.609
(sniffs)

29:53.347 --> 29:55.014
- BENNY: Hey.
- Hey.

29:55.016 --> 29:56.811
- Question.
- Yeah?

29:56.813 --> 29:59.785
Jules identified Lauren's body
after she died, right?

29:59.787 --> 30:01.487
- Right.
- Under NYPD protocols,

30:01.489 --> 30:04.536
that means they don't
need to verify the victim's ID

30:04.538 --> 30:06.242
through her prints.

30:06.727 --> 30:08.988
(chuckles) You're right. Lauren's prints

30:08.990 --> 30:10.943
aren't in the case file.
I'll call the M.E.

30:10.945 --> 30:12.631
- and get those ASAP.
- Well, they may also have them

30:12.633 --> 30:14.533
in the Indiana registry.
That's where she's from.

30:14.535 --> 30:15.952
I'll see what I find.

30:16.604 --> 30:19.605
So, um, listen, about the other day...

30:19.607 --> 30:21.340
we weren't saying
anything bad about Wes.

30:21.801 --> 30:23.876
I did a profile on him.

30:23.878 --> 30:25.244
A deep dive. I checked everything.

30:25.246 --> 30:26.812
- Because of what Allie said?
- He's not

30:26.814 --> 30:28.047
the type that gives gifts.

30:28.049 --> 30:29.782
Well, maybe you... you changed him.

30:29.784 --> 30:31.383
Maybe? Danny James,

30:31.385 --> 30:32.518
are you becoming a romantic?

30:32.520 --> 30:34.653
- No.
- (chuckles)

30:35.224 --> 30:36.822
I just know that any guy
with half a brain

30:36.824 --> 30:37.990
would not cheat on you.

30:37.992 --> 30:40.359
- Okay?
- Okay.

30:40.361 --> 30:41.758
Okay.

30:53.975 --> 30:55.374
Chunk. I assume you would have called

30:55.376 --> 30:57.476
if you found us a new suspect.

30:57.478 --> 31:00.865
You know me. Tell by your
tone, guess we need a new one?

31:01.018 --> 31:03.118
What did our dance captain, Angela, say?

31:03.120 --> 31:05.530
- Would it help to put her on the stand?
- She has an alibi.

31:05.532 --> 31:07.818
Angela was at a club
at the time of the murder.

31:07.820 --> 31:11.188
Cable verified her Lyft receipt.
And she is no fan of Jules.

31:11.190 --> 31:13.676
All right. We've got one card
left to play.

31:14.237 --> 31:16.771
Don't go home yet. I've got
a witness for you to prep.

31:18.208 --> 31:20.408
- Any idea who this last witness is?
- Nope.

31:20.410 --> 31:22.543
But on this case,
nothing would surprise me.

31:23.914 --> 31:25.313
Your Honor,

31:25.315 --> 31:27.649
I call myself as my next witness.

31:27.651 --> 31:30.051
(scattered laughter)
Your Honor, sidebar.

31:30.053 --> 31:32.253
Approach the bench.

31:33.456 --> 31:35.924
This is just another act
in his circus show,

31:35.926 --> 31:37.992
in which Mr. Caffrey attempts to ask

31:37.994 --> 31:40.028
and answer questions of himself.

31:40.030 --> 31:43.898
I have a constitutional right
to testify on my own behalf.

31:43.900 --> 31:45.233
What's your plan, Mr. Caffrey?

31:45.235 --> 31:46.801
Dr. Bull is gonna be asking me
questions.

31:46.803 --> 31:48.469
Your Honor, Dr. Bull is not an attorney.

31:48.471 --> 31:49.938
BULL: New York State law allows

31:49.940 --> 31:51.673
that any member of the pro se
defense team may ask

31:51.675 --> 31:52.974
the defendant questions.

31:52.976 --> 31:54.008
That will be me.

31:54.749 --> 31:55.677
Proceed.

31:55.679 --> 31:57.545
BULL: <i>Mr. Caffrey,</i>

31:57.547 --> 32:00.448
people call you a trophy wife hunter,

32:00.450 --> 32:02.016
a sugar daddy,

32:02.018 --> 32:03.383
a player.

32:03.787 --> 32:04.953
What do you say to them?

32:04.955 --> 32:05.920
It's true.

32:05.922 --> 32:08.089
I've fallen in love more than once.

32:08.091 --> 32:10.491
But I've never bought
anyone's affection. I mean,

32:10.493 --> 32:11.526
you've met my exes.

32:11.528 --> 32:13.194
BULL: What about Lauren?

32:13.196 --> 32:15.196
There was a 20-year age difference.

32:15.198 --> 32:18.166
(chuckles) Believe me,
I couldn't buy Lauren.

32:18.168 --> 32:20.702
She was the one who wanted
to sign a prenup, not me.

32:20.704 --> 32:23.538
And I wouldn't have
proposed a fourth time

32:23.540 --> 32:25.807
unless I believed we had something real.

32:25.809 --> 32:28.443
But you thought she was cheating on you?

32:28.445 --> 32:33.181
Lauren was being evasive
the week of her death.

32:33.183 --> 32:35.350
I confronted her and jumped

32:35.352 --> 32:36.918
to a jealous conclusion.

32:36.920 --> 32:40.521
But the truth is, as I later found out,

32:40.523 --> 32:42.357
she was discreetly helping a friend

32:42.359 --> 32:44.359
avoid being unfairly judged

32:44.361 --> 32:47.161
for his sexual orientation.

32:47.163 --> 32:51.766
Which makes me love her
and miss her even more.

32:51.768 --> 32:54.168
(door opens)

32:54.170 --> 32:55.470
BULL: Your Honor, I would like

32:55.472 --> 32:58.106
to introduce the following
photos into evidence.

32:58.108 --> 32:59.741
Objection. This wasn't in discovery.

32:59.743 --> 33:01.142
BULL: Um, some leeway here,

33:01.144 --> 33:04.015
Your Honor. Uh, we only just
discovered this information.

33:04.017 --> 33:05.980
Tread carefully, Dr. Bull.

33:05.982 --> 33:07.815
Hey, this isn't what we prepped.

33:07.817 --> 33:09.617
- Are we allowed to do this?
- Bull, you are

33:09.619 --> 33:11.185
already three feet off the ledge.

33:11.187 --> 33:14.055
If you ambush Jules,
I have no idea what he might do.

33:14.057 --> 33:15.456
BULL: Thank you, Chunk.

33:15.458 --> 33:17.492
(quietly): And calm down, Marissa.

33:18.212 --> 33:19.794
You recognize this woman?

33:19.796 --> 33:20.762
Yes.

33:20.764 --> 33:21.987
That's Lauren.

33:21.989 --> 33:24.298
BULL: And would you please
read the name that's printed?

33:25.924 --> 33:27.468
Robin Cleary.

33:27.470 --> 33:28.803
BULL: And what about these photographs?

33:28.805 --> 33:30.905
Are these also Lauren Wilson?

33:30.907 --> 33:32.407
Yes. Why?

33:33.085 --> 33:35.676
Bonnie Henson, Austin, Texas.

33:35.678 --> 33:40.314
Nicole Markey in Chicago,
Mandy Mitchell in New Orleans

33:40.316 --> 33:43.251
and Robin Cleary from Indianapolis.

33:43.253 --> 33:45.586
Mr. Caffrey, did you know
the woman you were engaged to

33:45.588 --> 33:48.389
had five different identities
in five different cities?

33:48.391 --> 33:50.892
Objection.
There's been no offer of proof.

33:50.894 --> 33:52.226
No prior discovery.

33:52.228 --> 33:53.628
Hold on, Ms. Giordano.

33:53.630 --> 33:55.096
- Well?
- We obtained

33:55.098 --> 33:56.697
Lauren's fingerprints
from the medical examiner.

33:56.699 --> 33:58.699
We ran it through the FBI

33:58.701 --> 34:00.201
identification database.

34:00.203 --> 34:02.403
And this afternoon we got a match.

34:02.405 --> 34:03.604
Proceed.

34:03.606 --> 34:04.872
Lauren Wilson, your fiancée,

34:04.874 --> 34:06.674
wasn't Lauren Wilson, your fiancée.

34:06.676 --> 34:10.210
She was Regina Preszler,

34:10.213 --> 34:11.344
and she was a grifter.

34:12.033 --> 34:13.581
Prosecution's trying to paint you

34:13.583 --> 34:15.371
as some kind of player.

34:15.885 --> 34:18.686
How does it feel to know that
you were the one who got played?

34:21.409 --> 34:22.757
(exhales)

34:26.577 --> 34:30.094
BULL: So, Mr. Caffrey, did you
have any idea that Lauren Wilson

34:30.134 --> 34:32.000
was actually Regina Preszler?

34:32.344 --> 34:33.467
- No.
- Did you know

34:33.469 --> 34:36.404
Regina Preszler was a grifter
in the middle of running a con

34:36.406 --> 34:38.581
on you at the time of her murder?

34:38.583 --> 34:40.992
- No.
- And given that she was a con artist,

34:40.994 --> 34:42.126
would it make sense

34:42.128 --> 34:44.045
that she had a lot
of shady characters in her life?

34:44.047 --> 34:46.192
Objection. Relevance.

34:46.194 --> 34:47.415
Well?

34:47.417 --> 34:48.483
It's a hypothetical.

34:48.485 --> 34:49.885
I am merely asking

34:49.887 --> 34:51.418
Mr. Caffrey,

34:51.420 --> 34:55.290
who maintains he did not murder
his beloved fiancée,

34:55.292 --> 34:59.154
if it's possible that someone
from this lady's sordid past

34:59.281 --> 35:01.381
could possibly have killed her.

35:01.383 --> 35:04.098
Because thieves make enemies.

35:05.287 --> 35:07.682
JUDGE: Answer the question, Mr. Caffrey.

35:07.751 --> 35:09.337
I suppose...

35:09.551 --> 35:11.266
it's possible.

35:11.268 --> 35:12.759
I just know it wasn't me.

35:12.761 --> 35:13.960
BULL: No further questions.

35:18.834 --> 35:21.593
Do you need a moment,
Mr. Caffrey? A tissue?

35:21.595 --> 35:23.236
An Oscar?

35:23.728 --> 35:25.301
No, thank you.

35:25.362 --> 35:27.129
I have one line of questioning.

35:27.131 --> 35:29.731
Are you sure you didn't know
Lauren was conning you

35:29.733 --> 35:31.166
before she was murdered?

35:31.787 --> 35:34.169
I had no idea until right now.

35:34.171 --> 35:36.104
SHELLEY: Because that
would make one hell

35:36.106 --> 35:38.406
of a motive, that kind of betrayal.

35:38.408 --> 35:39.541
- Objection.
- Yeah, I'm sure

35:39.543 --> 35:40.707
you object.

35:41.111 --> 35:42.883
Let me reframe.

35:42.885 --> 35:45.620
Person like you,
a wealthy public figure,

35:45.622 --> 35:48.608
neglected to do
a simple background check

35:48.610 --> 35:50.952
on your fourth wife?

35:50.954 --> 35:52.422
I thought...

35:53.885 --> 35:56.175
(voice breaking): what we had was real.

35:56.177 --> 35:58.793
- (scoffs)
- (taps foot twice)

36:04.568 --> 36:06.868
(elevator bell dings)

36:12.609 --> 36:14.809
(beeping)

36:30.360 --> 36:31.793
(gunfire sound effects)

36:31.795 --> 36:33.428
You're gaming again.

36:33.430 --> 36:34.596
I knew it.

36:34.598 --> 36:36.798
Oh, uh, hey.

36:36.800 --> 36:39.768
Um, uh, it's-it's not what
it looks like.

36:39.770 --> 36:42.237
It looks like you're binging
on <i> Titanfall</i> and Ray's Pizza.

36:42.239 --> 36:43.605
I'm sorry, Cable. I'm really sorry.

36:43.607 --> 36:45.073
Yeah. You should be.

36:46.577 --> 36:49.077
You ever lose to a girl before?

36:51.281 --> 36:54.683
Because you're going down.

36:54.685 --> 36:57.419
Next time, don't buy me
so many presents.

37:07.097 --> 37:09.431
You look like a Rodin sculpture.

37:09.433 --> 37:11.845
(chuckles)

37:13.003 --> 37:15.070
You got hustled, Jules. It happens.

37:15.072 --> 37:17.639
I know it happens. Just not to me.

37:17.641 --> 37:19.274
I didn't run a background check

37:19.276 --> 37:22.052
because I didn't want
to find any deal breakers.

37:22.879 --> 37:25.053
Love is blind.

37:26.565 --> 37:28.350
You will mourn.

37:28.352 --> 37:29.985
You will heal.

37:29.987 --> 37:32.117
And you will live to love again.

37:32.823 --> 37:35.032
I will never...

37:35.652 --> 37:37.711
forget her laugh,

37:39.302 --> 37:41.769
how she cried every time
she watched <i> Casablanca,</i>

37:41.898 --> 37:44.432
even, uh, how she tugged at her brow

37:44.434 --> 37:47.002
when she got tense. Man, I just...

37:47.004 --> 37:48.303
What did she do?

37:48.984 --> 37:52.240
Um, she tugged at her brow
when she got all tense.

37:53.277 --> 37:56.678
You don't have a picture
of her doing that, do you?

37:56.680 --> 37:58.213
Um...

37:58.215 --> 38:01.449
Yeah, a video. (chuckling)

38:01.451 --> 38:03.785
- Even better.
- Yeah. Oh, Bull.

38:03.787 --> 38:07.022
This was when sh-she was trying
out for my cheerleaders.

38:07.024 --> 38:10.025
(chuckles) She was so mad I recorded it.

38:10.027 --> 38:12.727
Ah, there it is. God, I love her.

38:12.729 --> 38:13.928
(chuckles)

38:13.930 --> 38:15.830
(phone buzzes)

38:16.833 --> 38:18.833
Yeah.

38:18.835 --> 38:20.835
Okay. Thanks.

38:20.837 --> 38:22.237
(phone beeps)

38:22.239 --> 38:24.272
Jury's back.

38:24.274 --> 38:26.116
It's decision time.

38:27.444 --> 38:29.911
BAILIFF: <i>Will the defendant
please rise for the verdict.</i>

38:35.719 --> 38:38.053
JUDGE: Madam Foreperson,
do you have a verdict?

38:38.055 --> 38:39.587
FOREPERSON: We do.

38:39.589 --> 38:43.425
We, the jury, find
the defendant, Jules Caffrey,

38:43.427 --> 38:44.959
not guilty.

38:44.961 --> 38:46.428
- (exhales)
- (murmuring)

38:48.298 --> 38:50.732
(exhales)

38:52.212 --> 38:53.702
Oh, man.

38:53.704 --> 38:55.704
You're gonna be okay.

38:55.706 --> 38:58.973
(sighs) Thank you.

39:03.146 --> 39:05.580
So, Shelley...

39:05.582 --> 39:08.083
Look, I'm not gonna pretend, Bull.

39:08.085 --> 39:10.685
It makes me sick when
a killer beats the rap.

39:10.687 --> 39:13.888
Then let's go find a killer.

39:15.726 --> 39:18.526
Hey! Check the bearing partition
on the second floor, huh?!

39:18.528 --> 39:20.762
MAN: You got it!

39:20.764 --> 39:22.697
Chris!

39:22.699 --> 39:24.966
BULL: Jared Preszler.

39:26.236 --> 39:27.202
Name's Derek.

39:27.204 --> 39:28.670
SHELLEY: Derek, Matthew,

39:28.672 --> 39:29.604
Ben, Jared.

39:29.606 --> 39:30.805
You're all under arrest.

39:30.807 --> 39:32.462
For what?

39:32.464 --> 39:34.175
The murder of your
sister, Regina Preszler,

39:34.177 --> 39:36.010
aka Lauren Wilson.

39:36.012 --> 39:38.346
BULL: Your tell is
called trichotillomania.

39:38.348 --> 39:42.183
It's a physical tic where
you tug at your eyebrow.

39:42.185 --> 39:43.418
- Your sister Lauren did it, too.
- (siren whoops)

39:43.420 --> 39:45.053
SHELLEY: Turns out it's
often a shared trait

39:45.055 --> 39:46.388
among siblings.

39:46.390 --> 39:48.556
Just like your DNA, which
was found at the crime scene.

39:48.558 --> 39:50.777
BULL: They missedit
the first time, since...

39:50.779 --> 39:52.794
- (Sirens)
- it's so much like Regina's.

39:52.796 --> 39:54.662
It's a good thing you testified.

39:55.665 --> 39:57.036
Jared Preszler!

39:57.038 --> 39:58.469
On the ground!

39:58.471 --> 40:00.802
On the ground!

40:00.804 --> 40:03.004
On your knees.

40:04.941 --> 40:06.541
Thank you.

40:07.293 --> 40:10.712
Well, The Jules Show deserved
a satisfying ending.

40:10.714 --> 40:12.313
You hungry?

40:12.315 --> 40:13.715
I am.

40:13.717 --> 40:15.750
- ♪ When the lights go dim ♪
- OFFICER: On your feet.

40:15.752 --> 40:18.686
♪ I drift off to sleep... ♪

40:20.390 --> 40:22.390
- Check me out.
- (chuckling)

40:22.392 --> 40:24.659
BULL: Well, Jules, there is an upside.

40:24.661 --> 40:28.630
Now you know Lauren loved you back.

40:30.049 --> 40:31.199
True.

40:31.201 --> 40:33.746
You started out as this guy who... well,

40:33.748 --> 40:37.138
you got arrested for fighting injustice.

40:37.140 --> 40:39.751
And that's what you did.

40:39.753 --> 40:41.876
And that's how you earned
that humanitarian award.

40:41.878 --> 40:43.178
Well, I thought

40:43.180 --> 40:44.779
by becoming the player,

40:44.781 --> 40:47.048
or aggressor, defender,

40:47.050 --> 40:48.416
I would never become

40:48.418 --> 40:49.751
a victim myself.

40:49.753 --> 40:51.805
I think you're ready to
reboot The Jules Show.

40:51.807 --> 40:54.189
Second act. 2.0.

40:54.191 --> 40:55.323
(chuckles)

40:55.325 --> 40:59.861
So says the man
with his own three-ring circus.

40:59.863 --> 41:01.296
Those clowns?

41:01.298 --> 41:02.464
(chuckles)

41:02.466 --> 41:04.866
No, you have your own show.

41:04.868 --> 41:06.753
You just put it on behind the scenes.

41:06.755 --> 41:07.982
Mm.

41:08.472 --> 41:12.674
Maybe you should try taking
the spotlight more often.

41:13.610 --> 41:16.277
You know, a very wise
man once said to me

41:16.279 --> 41:19.747
that you can get anything
you want out of people

41:19.749 --> 41:21.996
as long as you're not hung up

41:21.998 --> 41:24.085
on taking the credit.

41:24.087 --> 41:25.852
Nobody needs to know my name.

41:25.854 --> 41:27.188
Excuse me.

41:27.190 --> 41:28.423
Can I take a picture with you?

41:28.425 --> 41:30.258
You mean with Jules?

41:30.260 --> 41:31.826
Yeah. Who are you?

41:31.828 --> 41:33.194
Nobody important.

41:33.903 --> 41:35.864
All right, let's play some darts.

41:35.866 --> 41:39.501
I think Benny's the only one
that owes me money.

41:39.503 --> 41:41.202
Mm-hmm. So, it's a simple game.

41:41.204 --> 41:43.505
You just go like this.

41:43.507 --> 41:46.140
Oh, what? What?

41:46.142 --> 41:47.575
No one say it, please.

41:47.577 --> 41:48.543
MARISSA: <i>Bull's-eye.</i>
