[Heart-rate monitor flatlines]

00:06.098 --> 00:07.999
I came to ask for your help.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.633
You wish me
to stop the waves.

00:09.634 --> 00:10.634
Yes.

00:10.635 --> 00:12.370
We will restore the balance.

00:17.741 --> 00:20.877
Do you think
it exists?

00:20.878 --> 00:22.812
Well, if it does,
we have to find it.

00:22.813 --> 00:23.646
Finish it!

00:23.647 --> 00:24.947
[Fires]

00:24.948 --> 00:27.517
Your only legacy will be
that you murdered me.

00:27.518 --> 00:29.818
Adam, don't! No!

00:31.121 --> 00:33.855
[Magnus]: How did you survive?

00:33.856 --> 00:35.991
[Adam Worth]:
I was taken to the city.

00:35.992 --> 00:37.859
They treated me
as one of their own,

00:37.860 --> 00:41.030
showed me things
you can't even imagine.

00:41.031 --> 00:42.264
Adam!

00:42.265 --> 00:45.366
Has fulfilled his
function thus far.

00:45.367 --> 00:46.934
Now you're
my prisoner, Johnny.

00:46.935 --> 00:48.469
Welcome to my world.

00:53.608 --> 00:55.043
I'm Ranna Seneschal,

00:55.044 --> 00:57.045
You're incomers
from above,

00:57.046 --> 00:58.546
a threat to this city
and to this realm.

00:58.547 --> 01:00.915
You're to be executed,
immediately.

01:00.916 --> 01:02.482
[Magnus]:
We came here in peace.

01:02.483 --> 01:04.617
And in doing so,
you condemned yourselves.

01:04.617 --> 01:06.686
[Electricity crackles,

01:27.006 --> 01:28.974
Oh, don't try
to stare me down,

01:28.975 --> 01:30.809
old boy.

01:30.810 --> 01:33.644
I've grown accustomed
to your face.

01:33.645 --> 01:34.979
Here's the thing,

01:34.980 --> 01:37.482
my dear, sweet
little Worth...

01:37.483 --> 01:40.185
You'd best
off me now,

01:40.186 --> 01:43.488
because when I escape,

01:43.489 --> 01:46.124
I'm going to use you
to redefine suffering.

01:46.125 --> 01:48.726
Makes me feel better
about the news I have.

01:50.095 --> 01:51.128
It's about
your girlfriend.

01:52.129 --> 01:53.163
The one who likes
to kill you

01:53.164 --> 01:55.132
every so often.

01:55.133 --> 01:56.133
You can't quite get over her?

01:59.003 --> 02:01.105
It's for my sickness.

02:01.106 --> 02:02.973
My other sickness.

02:02.974 --> 02:04.575
It's from my good friends
down here.

I'll feel as right as rain.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.750
You were going to
tell me about Helen?

02:14.751 --> 02:15.951
Ah, yes.

02:15.952 --> 02:17.253
[Clucks in sympathy]

02:17.254 --> 02:18.588
She's bitten the biscuit,
I'm afraid.

02:18.589 --> 02:21.223
The word is
from my good people

02:21.224 --> 02:22.491
inside the city

02:22.492 --> 02:23.791
that Helen
and her merry little band

02:23.792 --> 02:24.859
were put to death.

02:26.929 --> 02:29.164
Why did you come back here?

02:30.465 --> 02:31.700
Just for revenge?

02:31.701 --> 02:34.002
This is not about
striking back at people.

02:34.003 --> 02:35.703
This is about so much more.

02:35.704 --> 02:37.038
If all goes well,

02:37.039 --> 02:38.572
everything's
about to change.

02:38.573 --> 02:41.142
Down here, up there.

02:41.143 --> 02:45.679
Reality as we know it
is about to be altered forever.

02:45.680 --> 02:48.815
What are you
up to, Adam?

02:48.816 --> 02:49.950
There is a belief,

02:49.951 --> 02:52.253
amongst certain people,

02:52.254 --> 02:54.754
that the poor beings down here

02:54.755 --> 02:56.922
have suffered
long enough

02:56.923 --> 02:58.525
under the city's rule.

02:58.526 --> 03:01.561
Apparently
they need a champion,

03:01.562 --> 03:04.130
and a champion they shall have.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.634
I've got to go.

03:07.635 --> 03:09.201
Things to do.

Please.
It will help.

04:00.617 --> 04:01.817
Why kill us and then do this?

04:01.818 --> 04:04.586
Ranna has questions,

04:04.587 --> 04:06.254
away from
the eyes of the Senate.

04:06.255 --> 04:07.756
Yeah...

04:07.757 --> 04:08.857
So do I.

04:33.614 --> 04:35.649
Be certain we're not
monitored or interrupted.

04:36.150 --> 04:38.952
Your Chamber
is secure, Ranna.

04:38.953 --> 04:41.988
- How dare you...
- I will ask the questions.

04:42.989 --> 04:43.589
You will answer them.

04:43.590 --> 04:45.858
Or you'll kill me again?

04:45.859 --> 04:46.992
Your life essence

04:46.993 --> 04:48.060
became property
of this state

04:48.061 --> 04:49.595

you set foot here.

04:49.596 --> 04:51.063

circumstances,

04:51.064 --> 04:52.564

further information.

04:55.034 --> 04:57.369
You really expect me
to cooperate?

04:57.370 --> 04:58.736
Your father was
a respected citizen here

04:58.737 --> 05:00.672
for 65 years,

05:00.673 --> 05:01.806
and then suddenly

05:01.807 --> 05:03.741
he chose to abandon
all reason

05:03.742 --> 05:05.477
and break our most sacred laws.

05:05.478 --> 05:06.578
Why?

05:06.579 --> 05:08.745
Ask him.

05:08.746 --> 05:10.848
Or is he dead somewhere,
hanging in a room?

05:10.849 --> 05:12.483
We don't know where he is.

05:12.484 --> 05:15.353
Since he infiltrated
the Avatar Chamber,

05:15.354 --> 05:16.720
he's...

05:16.721 --> 05:18.022
He's disappeared.

05:18.023 --> 05:20.424
He's been a fugitive
ever since.

05:20.425 --> 05:22.559
I can't imagine why.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.927
Tell me where Gregory
and Adam Worth are

05:24.928 --> 05:28.865
and I might
consider leniency.

05:28.866 --> 05:31.368
Adam Worth is a prisoner
in my home Sanctuary.

05:31.369 --> 05:33.336
I came here
looking for my father.

05:33.337 --> 05:35.105
Or the three of you
have formed an alliance

05:35.106 --> 05:36.939
and you're plotting
more acts of treason...

05:36.940 --> 05:38.774
Adam Worth nearly killed me

05:38.775 --> 05:40.910
trying to access
the holomap to this city.

05:41.911 --> 05:43.513
My father
broke your laws

05:43.514 --> 05:44.747
to protect you.

05:44.748 --> 05:46.682
To show me what Adam was after.

05:46.683 --> 05:47.917
He should have come to see me.

05:47.918 --> 05:49.184
[Chuckles ruefully]

I'm sure that would've worked
like a charm.

05:51.354 --> 05:53.455
This society existed

05:53.456 --> 05:54.824
while your ancestors

05:54.825 --> 05:56.925
were hiding in caves.

05:56.926 --> 05:58.527
For 8,000 years.

05:58.528 --> 06:02.531
Our very reason for being
is to maintain order.

06:02.532 --> 06:05.834
To hold back the beings
from within this realm

06:05.835 --> 06:07.002
from ever reaching
the surface.

06:07.003 --> 06:08.870
If this city falls...

06:08.871 --> 06:10.939
So does the surface.

06:10.940 --> 06:12.806
We maintain peace

06:12.807 --> 06:14.008
between humans

06:14.009 --> 06:16.410
and abnormals,

06:16.411 --> 06:18.646
despite the fact
that there are many species

06:18.647 --> 06:20.581
who seek our destruction.

06:20.582 --> 06:22.716
You must be aware of
our recent encounter

06:22.717 --> 06:23.584
with Big Bertha.

06:24.886 --> 06:26.754
Jaffalis Bertoloso.

06:26.755 --> 06:28.154
Kali.

you communicate with.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.459
We're finished in here.

06:33.460 --> 06:35.061
You don't possess
any information I need.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.630
Kali started a tidal surge

06:37.631 --> 06:39.866
that would have killed millions
had it not been stopped.

06:40.867 --> 06:41.768
Someone,

06:41.769 --> 06:43.536
some other
powerful abnormal,

06:43.537 --> 06:45.771
stepped in and launched
a counter-wave.

06:45.772 --> 06:48.440
You must have known about this,
have played a hand in it.

06:48.441 --> 06:50.609
Take her to the Chamber,
repeat the process,

06:50.610 --> 06:51.543
and have their bodies
warehoused.

06:51.544 --> 06:52.510
No!

06:52.511 --> 06:53.979
Look, we are not a threat!

07:00.586 --> 07:01.752
Geothermal power

07:01.753 --> 07:04.154
is what makes this city
run, isn't it?

07:04.155 --> 07:06.757
And yet
it's betraying you.

07:06.758 --> 07:08.893
Why else would there be
this much seismic activity?

07:08.894 --> 07:12.096
And your alliance
with the super abnormals,

07:12.097 --> 07:13.497
something's gone wrong,

07:13.498 --> 07:16.933
and you've no idea
how to handle it.

07:20.871 --> 07:22.538
You need my help.

07:31.781 --> 07:34.883
Nice to be back
where I belong.

07:53.168 --> 07:56.070
Remarkable.

08:07.048 --> 08:09.650
Dear God, you have
cameras everywhere.

08:09.651 --> 08:11.952
Every tribe, every race.

08:11.953 --> 08:13.053
Step away from there.

08:13.054 --> 08:14.054
Helen Magnus,

08:14.055 --> 08:15.789
Commander Juno Toland.

08:15.790 --> 08:17.223
Head of security.

08:17.224 --> 08:20.592
You injured
three of his men.

08:20.593 --> 08:21.661
Right.

08:21.662 --> 08:22.662
Sorry about that.

08:22.663 --> 08:24.063
I don't care

08:24.064 --> 08:26.132
that you're the daughter
of Gregory Magnus.

08:26.133 --> 08:27.133
You don't exist anymore.

08:27.134 --> 08:28.768
None of us

08:28.769 --> 08:33.238
will exist anymore, Toland,
if we don't widen our gaze.

08:33.239 --> 08:34.539
We need help.

08:35.541 --> 08:37.607
She's an expert
on hyper-species.

08:38.609 --> 08:39.910
I want this
kept from the Senate

08:39.912 --> 08:41.111
for as long
as possible, Toland.

08:41.113 --> 08:43.048
I'll do what I can.

08:46.985 --> 08:50.121
You were right
about geothermal power.

08:51.122 --> 08:55.559
Every few hundred years, the
magma spikes to dangerous levels.

08:55.560 --> 08:57.795
We call upon Kanaan
to use his power

08:57.796 --> 09:00.864
to create giant levees
to release the pressure.

09:01.865 --> 09:02.733
Kanaan...

09:02.734 --> 09:05.268
One of the hyper-species
abnormals.

09:05.269 --> 09:06.603
One of the Avatars
will spoke to.

09:06.604 --> 09:08.571
For weeks I've tried
communicating with him,

09:08.572 --> 09:11.808
but he doesn't answer.

09:11.809 --> 09:14.276
His Avatar doesn't
appear in the Chamber.

09:14.277 --> 09:16.179
He has never ignored us
for this long.

09:16.180 --> 09:17.246
And what about Kali?

09:17.247 --> 09:20.683
She doesn't know why
Kanaan isn't responding.

09:20.684 --> 09:22.085
And I'm guessing

09:22.086 --> 09:24.786
none of the other hyper-species
can create the levees you need.

09:24.787 --> 09:26.621
Once those magma pockets
go critical,

09:26.622 --> 09:28.223
the city will be destroyed.

09:28.224 --> 09:30.291
Well, what about the surface?

09:30.292 --> 09:32.160
Can't you seek shelter there,

09:32.161 --> 09:33.294
even temporarily?

09:33.295 --> 09:34.362
The magma below Praxis

09:34.363 --> 09:36.631
is linked to several
dormant volcanoes

09:36.632 --> 09:37.899
on three
of your continents.

09:37.900 --> 09:40.567
If the pressure
continues to climb...

09:40.568 --> 09:41.902
They'll go active.

09:41.903 --> 09:43.904
We need
to regain contact

09:43.905 --> 09:45.339
with Kanaan,

09:45.340 --> 09:48.843
or everything above
and below the surface will die.

09:55.363 --> 09:57.497
[Tremors rumbling]

09:57.498 --> 09:58.565
How long do we have?

09:58.566 --> 09:59.599
We have no way of knowing.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.000
I'm assuming

10:01.001 --> 10:02.836
you've dispatched teams
to speak to Kanaan in person.

10:02.837 --> 10:03.670
Yes,

10:03.671 --> 10:05.305
we've sent in robotic drones

10:05.306 --> 10:06.940
and we've conducted
a complete array of scans.

10:06.941 --> 10:09.810
[Fallon]: This is
Kanaan's actual form.

10:09.811 --> 10:11.678
Initially, he was found
in perfect health.

10:11.679 --> 10:12.745
But that's
not the case.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.747
No, there were elevated
stress indicators

10:14.748 --> 10:16.749
on many of his internal organs.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.685
We remotely injected him
with nutrients,

10:19.686 --> 10:21.554
we deployed
medical nanites

10:21.555 --> 10:22.488
to restore him
to health,

part of a longer pattern,

was made with him.

the heat distortion?

10:46.911 --> 10:50.514

these striations.

10:50.515 --> 10:52.516
I've seen them before
on Tunisian serropods.

10:52.517 --> 10:55.151

renal failure of some kind.

11:01.024 --> 11:02.592
Well, it's hard to diagnose,

11:02.593 --> 11:04.527

a Tunisian serropod before.

11:04.528 --> 11:05.795
Tell me what you need.

11:05.796 --> 11:06.996

to go through

11:07.965 --> 11:09.398

to all your research on him,

as well.

13:55.888 --> 13:56.988

He's forced to flee

21:18.436 --> 21:20.503
He sends two albinos
to suck my brain,

we already face.

Yeah...

Please stay here
until I get back.

[Sighs heavily]

30:33.461 --> 30:35.596
[Quietly]: Hey...

30:35.597 --> 30:36.730
You know
the classified part

30:36.731 --> 30:38.866
of his criminal
profile?

30:38.867 --> 30:40.133
The whole
contamination thing?

30:40.134 --> 30:41.502
Yeah.

30:41.503 --> 30:43.904
Tell me you hacked into it?

30:43.905 --> 30:45.939
It's a biometric
encryption system.

30:45.940 --> 30:47.140
So with the right
DNA combination,

30:47.141 --> 30:48.474
you can...

30:48.475 --> 30:52.345
Yes.
Yes, I hacked into it.

30:52.346 --> 30:54.381
I stole a sample

30:54.382 --> 30:55.048
from our uptight
friend over there.

30:57.851 --> 30:59.052
Don't ask.

31:00.854 --> 31:01.788
Okay, so what
did you find out?

31:01.789 --> 31:03.290
Well, nothing at first,

31:03.291 --> 31:04.656
but I kept digging,

31:04.657 --> 31:06.091
and I found out
Worth has been playing

31:06.092 --> 31:07.592
with something called
a kellorem device.

31:07.593 --> 31:09.494
Kellorem?

31:09.495 --> 31:12.764
Yeah. It's some kind of
super-powered energy source.

31:12.765 --> 31:14.066
It's banned
by the government,

31:14.067 --> 31:16.701
so they gave Worth
a few chances.

31:16.702 --> 31:18.537
He unleashes it,
kills 200 people.

31:18.538 --> 31:19.938
They sentence him
to temp-death.

31:19.939 --> 31:22.606
[Sighs]:
Banned, huh?

31:22.607 --> 31:24.542
Sounds about right.

31:24.543 --> 31:26.344
It's got to be the reason
why he came back to town.

31:26.345 --> 31:29.414
Yeah, and why someone
would hide it so deep.

31:29.415 --> 31:30.614

they won't hold.

31:34.786 --> 31:36.753
Well, get to the transport.
We'll meet you there.

31:36.754 --> 31:38.221
Not a chance.

31:39.924 --> 31:41.591
Oh, come on...

31:43.027 --> 31:44.661
I think I've got it.

31:44.662 --> 31:46.964
Good. Now, when you
bring it out, do so quickly.

31:46.965 --> 31:49.333
The trachnoid will
immediately seek a new host.

31:49.334 --> 31:50.434
Understood.

32:06.149 --> 32:09.417
I'm dialing back the cutter
to cauterize the wound.

32:19.061 --> 32:20.628
Definitely time
to get out of here.

32:20.629 --> 32:22.697
Agreed.

to access information

32:56.529 --> 32:57.862

32:57.863 --> 32:59.331
Why were you
trying to hide it?

32:59.332 --> 33:01.066
What are you
talking about?

33:01.067 --> 33:03.868
Worth was accused of
deploying this device

33:03.869 --> 33:05.103
in the city,

33:05.104 --> 33:06.604
causing massive
contamination.

33:06.605 --> 33:07.972
Except there's no
mention of this device

33:07.973 --> 33:09.007
in his criminal file.

33:09.008 --> 33:10.575
Meaning somebody
deleted it.

33:10.576 --> 33:12.443
Our records are kept
under the strictest security.

33:12.444 --> 33:13.944

33:13.945 --> 33:14.578
U've been
hacked, dude.

33:16.781 --> 33:17.948
What is this kellorem device?

33:20.185 --> 33:23.387
It's a powerful form
of anti-matter.

33:23.388 --> 33:25.523
Worth was fascinated by it.

33:25.524 --> 33:26.924
Said how it could be used
for many things.

33:26.925 --> 33:29.959
Things like
power supply, weapons.

33:29.960 --> 33:32.495
Hsasaid that its potential
was limitless.

33:32.496 --> 33:35.065
But you guys felt otherwise.

33:35.066 --> 33:36.566
Well, it's far too unstable

33:36.567 --> 33:37.867
to try and harness.

33:37.868 --> 33:39.702
Yeah, well,
he's after it again.

33:39.703 --> 33:42.105
Those nodes he used to
almost kill the doc,

33:42.106 --> 33:43.973
they needed
a lot of juice to work.

33:43.974 --> 33:46.575

is that powerful...

You both are insane.

33:51.747 --> 33:53.248
Are we really?

33:53.249 --> 33:55.117
Then why is somebody
trying so hard to bury this?

33:55.118 --> 33:56.618
Who else besides you

33:56.619 --> 33:58.187
has administrative access
to these files?

33:58.188 --> 34:00.055
Ranna, but she would
never be a part of this.

34:00.056 --> 34:01.855
What about someone
who could mimic

34:01.856 --> 34:03.657
her biometric
security clearance?

34:03.658 --> 34:04.559

is hiding in outland bunkers.

but according to
these readings,

34:45.931 --> 34:49.601
Kanaan has already begun
to dig new tunnels.

34:49.601 --> 34:52.003
[Tremor rumbles,

34:59.445 --> 35:00.478
Is everyone all right?

35:01.680 --> 35:03.848
Yeah.

35:03.849 --> 35:05.182
The module's still intact.

35:05.183 --> 35:06.916
We're okay.

Bloody hell.

Is there another way
out of here?

35:23.643 --> 35:24.844
There's the emergency override.

35:26.513 --> 35:28.881
The tunnel has
completely collapsed.

35:28.882 --> 35:31.615
Now would be a good time
to hang on.

35:46.064 --> 35:48.799
This was not
part of our agreement.

35:48.800 --> 35:51.702
Nor was hunting
me down like a dog,

35:51.703 --> 35:53.704
chasing me
to the surface.

35:53.705 --> 35:55.039
That was unavoidable.

35:55.040 --> 35:57.641
Ranna would not
abandon the search.

35:57.642 --> 35:58.976
I did everything I could
to help you retrieve

35:58.977 --> 35:59.976
Helen Magnus'
holomap.

35:59.977 --> 36:01.511
Still wasn't easy.

36:01.512 --> 36:03.045
But you have the device?

36:04.581 --> 36:06.016
And you're certain
it will do as you say?

36:06.017 --> 36:07.784
Oh, that and much more.

36:07.785 --> 36:10.020
Then the city can be saved.

We'll use its power

to shield us
from the magma buildup.

That is one option, yes.

for helping save the city.

41:56.844 --> 41:58.177
Kanaan thanks you.

42:10.190 --> 42:11.758
Are you sure
you want to do this?

42:12.759 --> 42:15.995
We could use you equally well
up on the surface.

42:16.996 --> 42:18.798
And beyond that, I...

42:20.200 --> 42:22.402
[Sighs]

42:22.403 --> 42:24.137
This is where I belong,

42:24.138 --> 42:25.971
for the moment.

42:25.972 --> 42:27.038
Helen...

42:29.909 --> 42:34.612
There's just too much here
for us to ignore.

42:34.613 --> 42:35.680
You'll contact me?

42:35.681 --> 42:37.249
The first chance I get.

42:37.250 --> 42:40.185
When you do,

42:40.186 --> 42:42.187
could you be a bit less cryptic?

42:42.188 --> 42:44.790
[Chuckles]
