00:02.264 --> 00:04.597
Tonight on Kitchen Nightmares,

00:04.597 --> 00:06.297
Chef Ramsay heads
across the bayou to Zeke's,

00:06.297 --> 00:09.397
a famous neighborhood joint,
where the current owners

00:09.397 --> 00:12.164
have alienated
the community.
that's just terrible.

00:12.164 --> 00:14.831
Everybody here is
just kinda waitin'

00:14.831 --> 00:16.764
- for the place to belly up.
- this husband and wife team

00:16.764 --> 00:19.064
seem to be only focused
on the bottom line.

00:19.064 --> 00:21.964
Your passion's about
portion control, measurements.

00:21.964 --> 00:24.064
You don't give a
about food.

00:24.064 --> 00:27.464
They have neglected
the menu...
What the hell is that?

00:27.464 --> 00:29.297
And their loyal staff.

00:29.297 --> 00:30.000
We are talked down to
like we're dirt.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.964
We are talked down to
like we're dirt.

00:31.964 --> 00:34.231
If you don't want
to be here, don't be here.

00:34.231 --> 00:36.831
Tonight, Chef Ramsay faces

00:36.831 --> 00:39.497
the most deluded owners
he's ever met.

00:39.497 --> 00:41.164
Restaurants don't
run like this.
I disagree.

00:41.164 --> 00:42.931
I disagree
with that also.

00:42.931 --> 00:45.397
He confronts them
with the cold, hard truth.

00:45.397 --> 00:48.031
So how the  is that
special in your tiny mind?

00:48.031 --> 00:49.731
When you start dealing
with all this crap,

00:49.731 --> 00:51.697
and your name's on that lease,

00:51.697 --> 00:53.764
then you tell me
what you want to do.

00:53.764 --> 00:55.731
But will they change their ways?

00:55.731 --> 00:58.097
- It's us against y'all.
- That is  up.

00:58.097 --> 01:00.000
Or will their stubbornness shut
down Zeke's once and for all?

01:00.000 --> 01:00.331
Or will their stubbornness shut
down Zeke's once and for all?

01:00.331 --> 01:02.031
You are not a
restaurateur.

01:02.031 --> 01:04.897
That's tonight
on Kitchen Nightmares.

01:26.397 --> 01:28.464
Located on the Mississippi River

01:28.464 --> 01:30.000
not far from the Gulf of Mexico,

01:30.000 --> 01:30.931
not far from the Gulf of Mexico,

01:30.931 --> 01:33.197
is the New Orleans suburb
of Metairie,

01:33.197 --> 01:36.297
a tight-knit community
that is home to Zeke's,

01:36.297 --> 01:39.031
a neighborhood restaurant
opened in 2002

01:39.031 --> 01:40.897
by a charismatic entrepreneur

01:40.897 --> 01:44.131
named Zeke Unangst.

01:44.131 --> 01:46.497
Zeke was 6'4", big and goofy,
but you know what?

01:46.497 --> 01:48.497
The man knew how
to have a good time,

01:48.497 --> 01:50.731
and he knew how to run
a pretty good restaurant.

01:50.731 --> 01:52.697
Everyone came to Zeke's
when it first opened

01:52.697 --> 01:54.997
because there was just
a good vibe in this place.

01:54.997 --> 01:57.031
Good people,
food was always good.

01:57.031 --> 02:00.000
We used to do 750 people in here
on a Friday night.

02:00.000 --> 02:00.164
We used to do 750 people in here
on a Friday night.

02:00.164 --> 02:02.164
But in 2005,

02:02.164 --> 02:04.630
Zeke tragically died
during hurricane Katrina,

02:04.630 --> 02:06.330
and the ownership
and the direction

02:06.330 --> 02:08.564
of the restaurant
was up in the air.

02:08.564 --> 02:10.564
After Katrina,

02:10.564 --> 02:14.264
This place was in limbo
until the Cortellos bought it

02:14.264 --> 02:16.097
and they pretty much
took on the place.
hi, guys.

02:16.097 --> 02:17.797
How are y'all tonight?
Welcome to Zeke's.

02:17.797 --> 02:19.997
When we bought Zeke's,
we chose to keep the name,

02:19.997 --> 02:22.497
because Zeke's
did a very good business.

02:22.497 --> 02:24.997
And that just made
business sense to us.
All right, guys,
first guests.

02:24.997 --> 02:26.464
When Darryl first took over,

02:26.464 --> 02:29.464
pretty much changed everything.
He cut staff.

02:29.464 --> 02:30.000
He cut product. He went to,
uh, a lesser quality.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.497
He cut product. He went to,
uh, a lesser quality.

02:32.497 --> 02:33.997
Wouldn't feed that
to your dog.

02:33.997 --> 02:36.530
And then on top of that,
he raised the prices.

02:39.164 --> 02:41.930
I feel as though I'm completely
handcuffed in the kitchen.

02:41.930 --> 02:44.430
Dude, I'd love to do,
like, uh, steamed clams.

02:44.430 --> 02:46.330
That's not us.
I don't think that's us.

02:46.330 --> 02:47.697
You know what
I'm saying?

02:47.697 --> 02:49.164
Always trying to beg him
or plead him,

02:49.164 --> 02:51.897
can we try that? can we do this?
and Darryl doesn't allow it.

02:51.897 --> 02:54.164
I'm trying to make chicken salad
out of chicken.

02:54.164 --> 02:56.530
I ask myself all the time,
why do I even stay here?

02:56.530 --> 02:59.797
Unh-unh, no sitting
on the job.

02:59.797 --> 03:00.000
Servers here
are all talked down to

03:00.000 --> 03:02.264
Servers here
are all talked down to

03:02.264 --> 03:03.597
or disrespected.

03:03.597 --> 03:05.397
People just
don't feel appreciated.

03:05.397 --> 03:07.964
Darryl cut my pay
in the last six months.

03:07.964 --> 03:10.130
I can't afford raises
right now.

03:10.130 --> 03:13.864
And he's made me work more
hours since he cut my pay.

03:13.864 --> 03:16.230
Darryl, we got three orders
of green tomatoes left.

03:16.230 --> 03:18.530
Cuttin' 'em a little thick,
too, I can tell you that.

03:18.530 --> 03:20.297
I'm not looking to squeak by.

03:20.297 --> 03:22.530
I'm looking for financial
rewards in this business.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.830
That kind of offended
a lot of Zeke's regulars,

03:27.830 --> 03:30.000
and business just
steadily declined.

03:30.000 --> 03:30.930
and business just
steadily declined.

03:30.930 --> 03:32.630
Meatball's
plain and bland.

03:32.630 --> 03:35.230
Unless he's got a pot
of gold stashed somewhere,

03:35.230 --> 03:38.897
there's no way this restaurant
will last, you know, a month.

03:38.897 --> 03:41.830
All right.
Payroll was today.

03:41.830 --> 03:45.430
How'd we do?
That's not a good
question.

03:45.430 --> 03:46.997
Financially, we are not
doing great.

03:46.997 --> 03:49.230
We gotta catch up somewhere.
It's not happenin'.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.697
We're not gonna make it

03:50.697 --> 03:52.397
If we don't have
Chef Ramsay come in

03:52.397 --> 03:54.564
and tell us what he thinks
we can do differently

03:54.564 --> 03:56.297
to change this,
because obviously,

03:56.297 --> 03:58.497
what we're doing--
it's not really working.

03:58.497 --> 04:00.000
Physically, emotionally,
it's been hard.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.664
Physically, emotionally,
it's been hard.

04:01.664 --> 04:05.164
I have put everything I can
possibly put into Zeke's,

04:05.164 --> 04:07.130
but seats aren't full,
so something's going on,

04:07.130 --> 04:10.097
and we've been killing
ourselves trying to find out.

04:14.264 --> 04:17.130
Before heading to Zeke's,

04:17.130 --> 04:19.097
Gordon has arranged to meet
some Metairie locals...
Morning.

04:19.097 --> 04:20.964
To gain some insight
into the restaurant

04:20.964 --> 04:22.830
and the neighborhood.

04:22.830 --> 04:25.097
How we doin'
this morning?
Very well indeed,
thank you.

04:25.097 --> 04:26.964
- Morning!
- Morning.

04:26.964 --> 04:29.197
How are we?

04:29.197 --> 04:30.000
Now tell me about
the area--Metairie.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.664
Now tell me about
the area--Metairie.

04:31.664 --> 04:33.430
What does it, uh,
what does it stand for?

04:33.430 --> 04:35.797
It's a town on the east bay.
Uh-huh.

04:35.797 --> 04:37.930
They got a lot of people.
They got some good restaurants

04:37.930 --> 04:39.597
out there.
and have you heard of
a restaurant called Zeke's?

04:39.597 --> 04:41.964
I used to go there quite a bit.
I haven't been there in a while,

04:41.964 --> 04:44.230
but before Katrina, we used
to go there quite a bit.

04:49.197 --> 04:51.230
What was
the difference in food?

04:51.230 --> 04:53.630
Got pricey and average.
Oh, really?

04:53.630 --> 04:55.597
Yeah.

04:58.530 --> 05:00.000
They lost the magic,
the feel of the restaurant.
Right.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.297
They lost the magic,
the feel of the restaurant.
Right.

05:01.297 --> 05:03.364
It just changed.
Yeah.

05:03.364 --> 05:04.964
Thank you, thank you.

05:04.964 --> 05:08.397
After hearing
unfavorable reviews,

05:08.397 --> 05:12.064
Chef Ramsay heads over to Zeke's
to continue his investigation,

05:12.064 --> 05:15.064
and there is nothing
more telling than lunch.

05:15.064 --> 05:18.197
Hello.
Why, hello, Chef Ramsay.
Welcome to Zeke's.

05:18.197 --> 05:20.330
How are you?
I'm very happy to be here.
I'm Ellen Cortello.
Nice to meet you.

05:20.330 --> 05:23.064
Definitely.
Come right this way.

05:23.064 --> 05:26.697
All right, guys, I think
we got a special guest.

05:26.697 --> 05:28.164
Heard that.
Heard that.

05:28.164 --> 05:30.000
Help me get up to speed.
You are the owner?
Yeah.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.664
Help me get up to speed.
You are the owner?
Yeah.

05:31.664 --> 05:35.297
You run the business
with Zeke?
My husband--no,
my husband is Darryl.

05:35.297 --> 05:37.130
Darryl. And where is he?
He is in the kitchen.

05:37.130 --> 05:39.064
So who's Zeke?

05:39.064 --> 05:42.364
Zeke was the original man
who opened the restaurant, um,

05:42.364 --> 05:44.497
passed away
right after Katrina.
Terrible.

05:44.497 --> 05:47.330
And we purchased it
from his estate,

05:47.330 --> 05:50.564
so we've had it
for almost five years.
okay, what did you change
after you bought it?

05:50.564 --> 05:52.497
The menu items are similar.

05:52.497 --> 05:55.464
Okay.
Um, we've definitely taken some
off and changed some recipes.

05:55.464 --> 05:57.430
And the chef
is the same?

05:57.430 --> 05:59.130
Emil is
the kitchen manager.
Emil?

05:59.130 --> 06:00.000
Yes.
Whose decision is it
with the new dishes?

06:00.000 --> 06:01.230
Yes.
Whose decision is it
with the new dishes?

06:01.230 --> 06:03.030
My husband Darryl.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.497
He's got a couple
of his recipes on the menu.

06:05.497 --> 06:07.897
And where did he
train as a chef?
He's never trained
as a chef.

06:11.030 --> 06:12.830
If you're not a chef, why would
you put dishes on the menu?

06:12.830 --> 06:14.697
Being in the business,
I guess, um--

06:14.697 --> 06:16.830
does the chef agree
with those dishes,

06:16.830 --> 06:18.830
or is it just because
he's the owner,

06:18.830 --> 06:21.697
that's why he gets them on?
I guess talk to him
about it.

06:21.697 --> 06:24.130
Okay, let me have
a look at the menu.
Okay.

06:24.130 --> 06:25.597
Thank you.
Uh-huh, you're welcome.

06:25.597 --> 06:27.197
Wow.

06:27.197 --> 06:28.630
- Hello.
- Hi, how are you today?

06:28.630 --> 06:30.000
Very well, thank you.
How are you?
I'm well, thank you.

06:30.000 --> 06:30.330
Very well, thank you.
How are you?
I'm well, thank you.

06:30.330 --> 06:32.330
I'm so happy to be in Louisiana.
My first time.
Good.

06:32.330 --> 06:33.897
Thank you,
and your first name is?
Candace.

06:33.897 --> 06:35.864
Candace.

06:35.864 --> 06:39.564
I saw on the menu
the oyster--
Oysters Cortello.

06:39.564 --> 06:42.297
It's an invented dish
for our restaurant.

06:42.297 --> 06:44.397
The Cortellos
is Darryl and Ellen,

06:44.397 --> 06:47.830
so they made--
they made it up.
So the owners have named
an oyster after them?

06:47.830 --> 06:50.530
Yes, they have.
They bought the restaurant, now
you want your name on the menu.

06:50.530 --> 06:53.397
Yes.
Sounds like someone's
struggling for power.

06:53.397 --> 06:55.397
I've gotta try one.
Okay.

06:55.397 --> 06:58.197
Yeah, and I must have
some boiled shrimp.
Boiled shrimp.

06:58.197 --> 07:00.000
And what special
do you have, my darling?
We have
a chicken fried steak today.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.664
And what special
do you have, my darling?
We have
a chicken fried steak today.

07:00.664 --> 07:03.864
Let's go for it.
We do have, also,
traditional bread pudding.

07:03.864 --> 07:06.330
Let's go for that,
and I think we're done.
Okay.

07:06.330 --> 07:08.697
Thank you.

07:08.697 --> 07:10.764
Look what I got.
All right, here we go.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.364
When Darryl got here, he kind of
implemented his own menu.

07:13.364 --> 07:17.464
It really gets frustrating,
because Darryl really has

07:17.464 --> 07:19.697
no idea culinary-wise
what he's doing.

07:19.697 --> 07:23.130
Candace, you're ready.
I'm gonna take out
the boiled shrimp to him.

07:23.130 --> 07:25.764
Chef Ramsay
is going to love this food.

07:25.764 --> 07:28.264
It's simple food. It's basic
food. It's feel-good food,

07:28.264 --> 07:30.000
but it's done very well
and fresh.
Okay.

07:30.000 --> 07:30.064
but it's done very well
and fresh.
Okay.

07:30.064 --> 07:32.530
Boiled shrimp.
Thanks, darling.

07:32.530 --> 07:34.997
My first Louisiana shrimp.

07:34.997 --> 07:37.130
Yeah, they're really soft.

07:37.130 --> 07:40.664
They should peel easily and sort
of pop out of the shell,

07:40.664 --> 07:42.964
but I'm struggling
to peel them.

07:45.497 --> 07:47.864
Hmm. I mean, that was nasty.

07:47.864 --> 07:50.497
What I'm struggling for here
is the lack of freshness.

07:50.497 --> 07:52.030
They feel and taste
slightly mushy,

07:52.030 --> 07:54.830
which is a big disappointment.

07:54.830 --> 07:56.730
Candace,
were the shrimps fresh?
They're fresh frozen.

07:56.730 --> 07:59.664
Fresh frozen.

07:59.664 --> 08:00.000
But you can buy fresh shrimp
within a mile from here.
Yes, yes, yes.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.730
But you can buy fresh shrimp
within a mile from here.
Yes, yes, yes.

08:02.730 --> 08:05.630
The frozen shrimp
taste like.

08:05.630 --> 08:07.330
Oh, sorry. Crap.

08:07.330 --> 08:09.864
He wanted to know why
we would get frozen shrimp

08:09.864 --> 08:12.364
when you can go
to, like, the market

08:12.364 --> 08:14.464
and get 'em fresh
every day.
Okay.

08:14.464 --> 08:16.797
It's not uncommon

08:16.797 --> 08:19.964
to have frozen shrimp because
some things are okay frozen.
How we look
on the oysters?

08:19.964 --> 08:21.964
Comin' right now.
All right.

08:21.964 --> 08:23.697
Wow,

08:23.697 --> 08:26.330
that back wall is hideous.
what a mess.

08:26.330 --> 08:28.330
Do you have two seconds,

08:28.330 --> 08:30.000
please?
Yes.

08:30.000 --> 08:30.130
please?
Yes.

08:30.130 --> 08:32.564
What's with the, uh,
the swamp decor?

08:32.564 --> 08:35.397
Whose idea was that?
Um, mine
and my husband's.

08:35.397 --> 08:38.464
Too eat in a swamp?

08:38.464 --> 08:41.397
For--for children
or for adults?
For both.

08:41.397 --> 08:43.997
For both.
For both.

08:43.997 --> 08:45.797
Oysters Cortello.

08:51.664 --> 08:54.130
All right, here we go.
Okay, thank you.

08:54.130 --> 08:56.197
All right.
What the hell is that?

08:56.197 --> 08:59.430
These are
the oysters Cortello.
Oysters Cortello.

08:59.430 --> 09:00.000
So I suppose
you go like that...

09:00.000 --> 09:01.397
So I suppose
you go like that...

09:04.897 --> 09:06.764
Wow, they're dreadful.

09:06.764 --> 09:09.764
Oysters named
after the owner.

09:09.764 --> 09:11.697
I certainly wouldn't
put my name on that.

09:11.697 --> 09:14.330
I wouldn't even put
my enemy's name on that.

09:14.330 --> 09:16.797
Take it for you?
Mm-hmm.

09:16.797 --> 09:18.897
Okay.
Thank you.
That's depressing, isn't it?

09:20.430 --> 09:22.530
They're just...

09:22.530 --> 09:25.230
Oysters Cortello--I don't know
what to say about that.

09:25.230 --> 09:27.464
I eat them myself.
I think they're delicious.

09:27.464 --> 09:30.000
Absolutely delicious.

09:30.000 --> 09:30.830
Absolutely delicious.

09:30.830 --> 09:33.997
Oysters Cortello
just ain't workin'.

09:33.997 --> 09:37.497
This is killin' me,
not to know what he's saying.

09:37.497 --> 09:40.064
This is the fried
chicken steak, right?
Correct.

09:40.064 --> 09:42.730
Thank you.
You're welcome.

09:46.730 --> 09:50.530
Blander than anything.
No seasoning, no care.

09:50.530 --> 09:52.664
Look at that. Ugh.

09:52.664 --> 09:55.164
Candace,
what the hell is that?

09:55.164 --> 09:57.297
Looks like he's just
had a giraffe's tongue

09:57.297 --> 09:59.164
cut out and deep fat fried.

09:59.164 --> 10:00.000
People complain that the quality
of the food here is horrible.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.064
People complain that the quality
of the food here is horrible.

10:03.064 --> 10:04.530
Unbelievable.

10:04.530 --> 10:08.064
Darryl's not listening
to the feedback that he gets,

10:08.064 --> 10:10.364
and he's gonna do
what he wants to do.

10:10.364 --> 10:12.997
Darryl.
Yep.

10:12.997 --> 10:15.297
He said that it looks
like somebody cut out

10:15.297 --> 10:18.230
- a giraffe's tongue, battered and fried it.
-  I'm not gonna agree with that.

10:18.230 --> 10:20.030
It didn't look that way to me.

10:20.030 --> 10:22.897
I mean, that's what
normally goes out.

10:22.897 --> 10:25.264
It's a good product.

10:25.264 --> 10:27.364
Said it looked like
we cut out a giraffe's tongue.

10:27.364 --> 10:30.000
Well, well, well.
Thanks, love.

10:30.000 --> 10:30.464
Well, well, well.
Thanks, love.

10:33.664 --> 10:35.397
Doesn't look fantastic...

10:37.364 --> 10:39.897
But it tastes delicious.
Who made that?

10:39.897 --> 10:41.897
Emil makes it.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

10:41.897 --> 10:43.797
I'm just so happy

10:43.797 --> 10:45.697
That Chef Ramsay likes
the bread pudding.

10:45.697 --> 10:48.430
It feels great
to end on a good note.
Loved the bread pudding.

10:48.430 --> 10:50.130
He liked the bread pudding?

10:50.130 --> 10:52.864
There we go.
Loved it.

10:52.864 --> 10:55.564
I took full responsibility
for the bread pudding.

10:55.564 --> 10:58.297
That is all me. Darryl doesn't
really have influence on that.

10:58.297 --> 11:00.000
Thank God. Thank God
he likes something I did.

11:00.000 --> 11:00.997
Thank God. Thank God
he likes something I did.

11:00.997 --> 11:03.164
I'll take that
any day.

11:03.164 --> 11:05.064
Hello.
Hello, chef.

11:05.064 --> 11:07.130
And this is?
Darryl Cortello.

11:07.130 --> 11:09.130
The owner?
Yes, Chef.

11:09.130 --> 11:10.730
Introduce me
to your, uh, brigade.

11:10.730 --> 11:12.497
Chef Emil Morcos.
Emil.

11:12.497 --> 11:13.764
Good to see you, buddy.
Jason carpenter.

11:13.764 --> 11:15.264
Jason, good to see you.

11:15.264 --> 11:17.330
There's a lot of things
that--that need changing,

11:17.330 --> 11:19.164
and, you know, Darryl
is--is one of them.

11:19.164 --> 11:21.230
Can I talk about lunch?
Yes.

11:21.230 --> 11:23.830
My God, what a disaster.

11:23.830 --> 11:27.230
The food is below standard.

11:27.230 --> 11:29.097
Why wouldn't you buy
fresh shrimp?

11:29.097 --> 11:30.000
I simply don't have the time
to go to the market.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.264
I simply don't have the time
to go to the market.

11:31.264 --> 11:34.797
Excuse me?
Where are we?

11:34.797 --> 11:37.697
We're in New Orleans.
Come on.
Come on, big boy.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.897
Chicken fried steak--
disaster.

11:39.897 --> 11:42.830
What cuts of meat
was that?

11:42.830 --> 11:44.897
Not a very good cut.
No.

11:44.897 --> 11:47.597
Are you proud
to serve that food?
No, sir.

11:47.597 --> 11:50.564
Was that the same quality of
steak we were using years ago?

11:50.564 --> 11:52.230
No, sir.

11:52.230 --> 11:54.230
Then why have you changed
the standards?

11:54.230 --> 11:57.764
Um, it's--
it's up to Darryl.

11:57.764 --> 12:00.000
It that a cutting corner
method to save money, or--
No, no, no. Chef...

12:00.000 --> 12:00.830
It that a cutting corner
method to save money, or--
No, no, no. Chef...

12:00.830 --> 12:04.097
Yeah.
But we had diners eating all--
all lunch, full dining room,

12:04.097 --> 12:06.164
and nothing sent back.
do you honestly think

12:06.164 --> 12:08.564
just because they don't
send it back

12:08.564 --> 12:10.930
that your food
is  amazing?

12:10.930 --> 12:13.897
That's good enough for you
to continue?

12:13.897 --> 12:16.597
Now, you can't be
that  stupid.

12:16.597 --> 12:18.197
Point taken.

12:18.197 --> 12:20.664
If you want to be that stupid,
you've got no chance.

12:23.397 --> 12:26.064
I don't buy the fact that
it's bad quality food.

12:26.064 --> 12:28.697
- That's.
- Hard to believe

12:28.697 --> 12:30.000
this was
once a great place.

12:30.000 --> 12:30.230
this was
once a great place.

12:30.230 --> 12:31.830
Coming up,

12:31.830 --> 12:34.330
while Darryl and Ellen
continue to be defensive...

12:34.330 --> 12:37.030
We don't feel like
it puts out an awful product.

12:37.030 --> 12:39.430
You don't give
a  about food.

12:39.430 --> 12:41.564
the staff goes on the offensive.

12:41.564 --> 12:44.464
You talk to us
like dirt.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.397
Then at dinner service,

12:46.397 --> 12:49.164
Chef Ramsay makes
a shocking discovery.
Oh...

12:49.164 --> 12:51.097
How the  is that special
in your tiny mind?

12:51.097 --> 12:54.430
I don't have
a tiny mind.
I'm telling you,
you have a tiny mind.

12:54.430 --> 12:56.797
And makes an announcement
that could mean

12:56.797 --> 12:58.463
the beginning
of the end for Zeke's.

12:58.463 --> 13:00.000
How would you feel
if I told you all that...

13:00.000 --> 13:01.897
How would you feel
if I told you all that...

13:09.924 --> 13:12.390
After receiving some harsh words
from Chef Ramsay...

13:12.390 --> 13:15.790
The food
is below standard.

13:15.790 --> 13:17.790
Darryl has some words
of his own.

13:17.790 --> 13:19.957
You know, chef says
everything is.

13:19.957 --> 13:22.557
It's embarrassing, there's
nothing good about the menu,

13:22.557 --> 13:24.057
you know, I don't
buy that.

13:24.057 --> 13:25.757
I will never believe
the food is.

13:25.757 --> 13:27.524
You're not gonna--I've been
eating this food all my life.

13:27.524 --> 13:30.190
Chef Ramsay doesn't know
New Orleans food. That's it.

13:30.190 --> 13:32.657
I mean, cut all the food down
you want. You can't break me.

13:35.524 --> 13:36.552
It's an hour
before dinner service,

13:36.552 --> 13:38.124
It's an hour
before dinner service,

13:38.124 --> 13:40.924
and Chef Ramsay hopes a private
meeting with the two chefs,

13:40.924 --> 13:42.590
Emil and Jason,

13:42.590 --> 13:45.657
can shed some light
on the restaurant's main issues.

13:45.657 --> 13:49.024
Okay,
so I don't get it.

13:49.024 --> 13:52.424
Some of the things I encountered
there today were just awful.

13:52.424 --> 13:56.090
That can't be your wish,
to cook with frozen ingredients.

13:56.090 --> 13:58.490
We talk about it
every day...
Yep.

13:58.490 --> 14:01.757
And it just gets swept
under the table.
I tell him, the second
he starts cutting cost

14:01.757 --> 14:03.657
and getting
a cheaper product...
yeah, yeah.

14:03.657 --> 14:05.790
You know it's gonna
taste like.

14:05.790 --> 14:06.552
And trying to explain
that to him, you know--
is like talking
to this wall right here.

14:06.552 --> 14:08.924
And trying to explain
that to him, you know--
is like talking
to this wall right here.

14:08.924 --> 14:11.624
And how long's
it been goin' on like that?
Since right around
the time he took over.

14:11.624 --> 14:13.590
The only thing
Darryl and Ellen see is money,

14:13.590 --> 14:15.390
and that's what scares me.

14:15.390 --> 14:18.524
Their whole purpose is money,
money, money, money, money.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.357
Feel like my hands
are so tied

14:20.357 --> 14:21.990
as far as ordering goes,
everything goes,

14:21.990 --> 14:24.557
the only other option was
to leave, me and him both go.

14:24.557 --> 14:27.057
Yes.
You know, what do you do,
just walk out the place?

14:27.057 --> 14:29.290
I mean, we got a lot of personal
memories in this place,

14:29.290 --> 14:31.390
just to walk out of it.
granted, I-I get that,

14:31.390 --> 14:33.290
but it doesn't stop you
from having your voice.

14:33.290 --> 14:35.557
Everybody here is just
kind of waiting for the place

14:35.557 --> 14:36.552
to belly up and go find
a new job somewheres else.

14:36.552 --> 14:37.424
to belly up and go find
a new job somewheres else.

14:37.424 --> 14:41.190
I'm here to help put this
frickin' place back on the map.

14:41.190 --> 14:42.824
Yes, sir.
You're absolutely right.

14:42.824 --> 14:44.590
We have only two options--
Chef Ramsay or God,

14:44.590 --> 14:46.657
and I don't think the second
coming's happening anytime soon.

14:46.657 --> 14:49.757
- Thanks for the catch-up.
- Thank you.

14:53.490 --> 14:57.057
After gaining some insight

14:57.057 --> 14:59.724
from Jason and Emil...
Hey, I need
shrimp portions.

14:59.724 --> 15:03.257
Chef Ramsay is eager to see
how this restaurant functions

15:03.257 --> 15:05.057
- in a dinner service.
- uh, how does this work?

15:05.057 --> 15:06.552
Uh, Emil.

15:06.552 --> 15:07.490
Uh, Emil.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.790
When were these done?

15:09.790 --> 15:11.990
Um, last night.

15:11.990 --> 15:14.924
Why are they bagged?

15:14.924 --> 15:17.024
Really?

15:20.990 --> 15:24.357
What's the idea of putting
everything in bags?

15:24.357 --> 15:26.690
Portion size.
Portion size.

15:26.690 --> 15:28.824
I like to have everything
in quantitative perspective.

15:28.824 --> 15:30.757
If I give too much,
you get a happy customer here.

15:30.757 --> 15:32.857
You don't get a good customer.
They're happy because

15:32.857 --> 15:35.124
they're getting three times
what they should be getting.

15:35.124 --> 15:36.552
I'm getting nothing.
I don't make money on that.

15:36.552 --> 15:37.990
I'm getting nothing.
I don't make money on that.

15:42.990 --> 15:45.657
Hi, welcome to Zeke's. How many
do you have in the party?
Four.

15:45.657 --> 15:47.824
It's Chef Ramsay's first time
in Louisiana...

15:47.824 --> 15:49.790
Come right
this way, please.
And not surprisingly,

15:49.790 --> 15:51.424
Zeke's is completely
booked.

15:51.424 --> 15:54.190
And tonight our special
is lasagna.

15:55.757 --> 15:58.390
I got a seafood platter,
no oyster, sub shrimp.

15:58.390 --> 16:01.324
I'm at the expo station. I like
to see all the food go out.

16:01.324 --> 16:03.657
Side of new potatoes, Darryl.

16:03.657 --> 16:06.552
I, uh, make sure every dish goes
out like I want it to go out.

16:06.552 --> 16:06.990
I, uh, make sure every dish goes
out like I want it to go out.

16:06.990 --> 16:10.690
Can I run anything?
No.

16:10.690 --> 16:13.224
Shrimp platter!

16:13.224 --> 16:15.990
Can any of that go?
I'm waiting on dishes
to complete their order.

16:15.990 --> 16:19.390
It doesn't concern you that
food's just dying in the window?

16:19.390 --> 16:22.757
Well, we're pushing
as hard as we can.
Bloody hell.

16:22.757 --> 16:24.590
Expediting's one thing,

16:24.590 --> 16:26.857
standing here and saying
nothing is another.

16:26.857 --> 16:29.157
Wow,  wow.

16:29.157 --> 16:31.524
It's an hour
into dinner service,

16:31.524 --> 16:33.724
and the first wave of food
is finally making its way

16:33.724 --> 16:36.552
out to the customers.
sorry about the wait.
they are backed up.

16:36.552 --> 16:36.824
out to the customers.
sorry about the wait.
they are backed up.

16:39.924 --> 16:42.124
Let me get, uh, your server.
My apologies.

16:42.124 --> 16:44.424
And the food
isn't the only thing

16:44.424 --> 16:47.124
- that's getting a chilly reception.
-  May I ask something?

16:47.124 --> 16:49.090
Would you mind not
standing there like that?

16:49.090 --> 16:51.190
It's so dour. I think
you can be more proactive.

16:51.190 --> 16:53.657
I don't want to hover,
you know.
But you can make
yourself busy.

16:53.657 --> 16:56.124
Okay, I got it.

16:56.124 --> 16:58.090
I'm ready.
Good.

16:58.090 --> 16:59.457
Thank you.

16:59.457 --> 17:02.790
All right,
look what I got.

17:02.790 --> 17:04.857
What's that one?
Lasagna.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.552
Lasagna. When was
the lasagna made?
Last Thursday.

17:06.552 --> 17:06.857
Lasagna. When was
the lasagna made?
Last Thursday.

17:06.857 --> 17:09.524
Last Thursday. And today
is Thursday, right?

17:09.524 --> 17:12.190
Correct.

17:12.190 --> 17:14.057
Serving them stuff
from a week ago.

17:14.057 --> 17:17.624
Help me to understand that,
uh, that stupidity.

17:17.624 --> 17:19.557
Made the pan,
we didn't sell it all,

17:19.557 --> 17:22.090
it's wrapped up in portions,
and, uh, frozen.

17:22.090 --> 17:24.357
Not that
that's a bad thing.

17:24.357 --> 17:26.890
Lasagna--it's all done
fresh cooked, and, uh,

17:26.890 --> 17:28.624
we'll wrap the portions up
separately,

17:28.624 --> 17:30.924
we'll put 'em in the freezer.
it works.

17:30.924 --> 17:33.624
It is the best lasagna
you're going to get.
It's the special, right?

17:33.624 --> 17:36.552
- Yes, it is.
-  Okay, so how the  is that special in your tiny mind,

17:36.552 --> 17:36.990
- Yes, it is.
-  Okay, so how the  is that special in your tiny mind,

17:36.990 --> 17:39.190
when it's cooked
a week ago?

17:39.190 --> 17:41.190
I don't have
a tiny mind.

17:41.190 --> 17:43.090
I'm telling you,
you have a tiny mind.

17:43.090 --> 17:45.457
It can't be that special
if you're gonna stand here

17:45.457 --> 17:47.624
and tell me that
it's special--
this--the product
is good.

17:47.624 --> 17:50.024
Darryl runs this kitchen

17:50.024 --> 17:53.324
With 90% bravado, and, you know,
the other 10%, he just wings it.

17:53.324 --> 17:56.324
- This is a good product.
- This is good food.

17:56.324 --> 17:58.257
My God. it's getting worse.

18:00.257 --> 18:03.457
Yeah, he's a tough nut,
your, uh, expediter.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.224
So we have
a special today--

18:05.224 --> 18:06.552
when do you think
that lasagna was made?
Today.

18:06.552 --> 18:07.124
when do you think
that lasagna was made?
Today.

18:07.124 --> 18:09.424
Homemade lasagna?
Right.

18:09.424 --> 18:11.524
Last Thursday.
How can it be that special

18:11.524 --> 18:13.324
when it's from a week ago?
well, you know,
it's frozen,

18:13.324 --> 18:15.657
so it's not, like, sitting
there getting mildew on it,

18:15.657 --> 18:18.057
and our customers
absolutely love the lasagna.
You're missing
the point.

18:18.057 --> 18:20.857
I don't think that's
our biggest issue is lasagna.

18:20.857 --> 18:22.757
I mean, that's absolutely
incorrect.

18:22.757 --> 18:25.324
What do you think
they would feel like

18:25.324 --> 18:28.490
if you told them today's special
was cooked a week ago, frozen.
I don't know,

18:28.490 --> 18:31.724
I mean, uh, I'm sure they
would probably be surprised

18:31.724 --> 18:34.724
that it was so good and that it
was made last week and frozen.

18:34.724 --> 18:36.552
Shall I ask
them all?

18:36.552 --> 18:37.157
Shall I ask
them all?

18:37.157 --> 18:40.357
Would you like me
to walk with you?
I'm not gonna walk,
I'm gonna stand up and shout.

18:40.357 --> 18:43.357
Oh, really?
Yeah.

18:51.457 --> 18:53.424
When you come out
to a restaurant,

18:53.424 --> 18:55.490
and you read
today's specials,

18:55.490 --> 18:57.257
for instance,
a beautiful homemade lasagna,

18:57.257 --> 19:00.490
would you expect that lasagna
to be made today?

19:00.490 --> 19:02.390
Yes!
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

19:02.390 --> 19:04.290
how many of you
have ordered lasagna?

19:06.390 --> 19:06.552
How would you feel
if I told you all

19:06.552 --> 19:09.257
How would you feel
if I told you all

19:09.257 --> 19:12.624
that today's lasagna
that's being served

19:12.624 --> 19:15.057
was made a week ago?

19:17.957 --> 19:20.357
This is humiliating.

19:29.951 --> 19:31.851
After making
a shocking discovery

19:31.851 --> 19:33.751
about today's special...
When was
the lasagna made?

19:33.751 --> 19:36.018
Last Thursday.
Chef Ramsay made an announcement...

19:38.085 --> 19:41.351
Today's lasagna that's being
served was made a week ago.

19:41.351 --> 19:44.818
That is not sitting well
with customers.

19:44.818 --> 19:47.885
My apologies to those
that have ordered the lasagna.

19:47.885 --> 19:50.385
Have a look at the potential
other specials.

19:50.385 --> 19:53.018
Bon appétit. Thank you.

19:53.018 --> 19:55.685
- Thank you.
- This is humiliating.

19:55.685 --> 19:55.698
It's absolutely better,
of course, when it's fresh

19:55.698 --> 19:57.685
It's absolutely better,
of course, when it's fresh

19:57.685 --> 20:01.418
and served right out of
the pan, but it's not horrible.

20:01.418 --> 20:03.485
I've just told
the customers

20:03.485 --> 20:06.251
that today's lasagna
was reheated from a week ago.

20:06.251 --> 20:08.385
The feedback
was shock, horror.

20:08.385 --> 20:11.385
86 the lasagna?
Yes, sir.

20:11.385 --> 20:13.251
With Chef Ramsay's announcement

20:13.251 --> 20:15.985
fresh in their minds...
Get the check? Okay.

20:15.985 --> 20:18.151
Customers have seemed
to have lost their appetite.

20:18.151 --> 20:20.018
me.

20:20.018 --> 20:23.151
Did y'all eat already?
Yeah, I had the lasagna.

20:26.418 --> 20:30.051
After witnessing a dinner
service full of problems...

20:30.051 --> 20:32.251
Do you have
two seconds, please?
Yes, absolutely.

20:32.251 --> 20:35.251
Chef Ramsay is anxious
to have a chat with the owners.

20:35.251 --> 20:37.685
Oh, dear.

20:37.685 --> 20:40.551
Did you hear
the customers tonight

20:40.551 --> 20:42.585
when I told them
the lasagna was a week old?

20:42.585 --> 20:46.085
Did you hear?
Here's what happens--
cook the lasagna,

20:46.085 --> 20:48.151
and it doesn't sell.
do you throw it away?

20:48.151 --> 20:50.818
No, we don't throw it away.
We wrap it.

20:50.818 --> 20:52.818
I'm here to help,
but I'll tell you what,

20:52.818 --> 20:54.751
I can't help you when
you're standing there

20:54.751 --> 20:55.698
and trying to come up with
excuses to why the customers

20:55.698 --> 20:57.251
and trying to come up with
excuses to why the customers

20:57.251 --> 21:00.385
paid good money for frozen
that cooked a week ago,

21:00.385 --> 21:03.618
and you call it
a special.
we don't feel like
it puts out an awful product.

21:03.618 --> 21:06.851
You don't give a
about food.

21:06.851 --> 21:09.851
That's not true.
Your passion's about
portion control,

21:09.851 --> 21:13.518
measurements, frozen foods
reheated in a microwave.

21:13.518 --> 21:15.651
Restaurants don't run
like this.

21:15.651 --> 21:18.318
I disagree.
I disagree with that
also, definitely.

21:19.651 --> 21:22.918
Trust me, you are not
a  restaurateur.

21:26.318 --> 21:28.351
You the owner?
You paying rent here?

21:28.351 --> 21:30.185
When you start dealing
with all this crap,

21:30.185 --> 21:32.184
and your name's on that lease,

21:32.184 --> 21:34.451
then you tell me
what you want to do.

21:42.284 --> 21:44.518
After being stonewalled
by owners in denial...

21:44.518 --> 21:46.651
Morning.
Good morning, Chef.

21:46.651 --> 21:49.784
Chef Ramsay has called
a staff meeting...
Two minutes, please.

21:49.784 --> 21:51.684
Hoping to bring all
of the restaurant's issues

21:51.684 --> 21:54.118
into the open.
okay,

21:54.118 --> 21:55.698
I want you

21:55.698 --> 21:56.718
I want you

21:56.718 --> 21:58.784
to tell me
the frustrations,

21:58.784 --> 22:01.284
the anger,

22:01.284 --> 22:04.051
and the things that
really upset you the most.

22:04.051 --> 22:05.984
Emil.
Uh...

22:05.984 --> 22:07.884
I-I just feel as though

22:07.884 --> 22:09.884
I'm getting pounded
with a mallet

22:09.884 --> 22:12.051
constantly when
I walk into this place.

22:12.051 --> 22:15.284
I went from working
40 hours

22:15.284 --> 22:17.018
to working about 50,

22:17.018 --> 22:20.051
for $400 a week.
that pisses me off.

22:21.884 --> 22:24.818
I feel that we don't
get any respect.

22:24.818 --> 22:25.698
I'm here all the time.

22:25.698 --> 22:27.084
I'm here all the time.

22:27.084 --> 22:30.184
I don't get to eat lunch.
I should have a meal.

22:30.184 --> 22:32.384
I should have
a shift meal.
This is messed up.

22:32.384 --> 22:34.884
We are talked down to

22:34.884 --> 22:38.018
like we're dirt,
and it's not right.

22:38.018 --> 22:41.318
Listen, um,

22:41.318 --> 22:43.318
I really appreciate
the openness and the honesty.

22:43.318 --> 22:45.051
I knew it was bad,

22:45.051 --> 22:48.318
but I didn't quite understand
it had hit that level of hurt.

22:48.318 --> 22:51.551
I think it's just--it's just sad
that we're all sitting here

22:51.551 --> 22:55.318
and that we actually even
have to be at this point.
I think we all--

22:55.318 --> 22:55.698
the whole group of us here
are pretty much struggling.

22:55.698 --> 22:57.784
the whole group of us here
are pretty much struggling.

22:57.784 --> 23:01.384
No one's getting
that message across.

23:01.384 --> 23:04.184
I need to get through
to them.

23:04.184 --> 23:06.718
Darryl and Ellen
are about to arrive.

23:06.718 --> 23:09.051
I want you
to tell them.

23:12.984 --> 23:15.918
Everybody was saying
what they wanted to say

23:15.918 --> 23:18.584
and getting it off their chest,
but it's kind of different

23:18.584 --> 23:20.784
from telling Chef Ramsay
versus telling Darryl.

23:20.784 --> 23:23.184
Don't be nervous.
I don't want you to be afraid.

23:23.184 --> 23:25.684
I've got your back.

23:25.684 --> 23:25.698
Okay?

23:25.698 --> 23:28.551
Okay?

23:28.551 --> 23:30.984
And here they are.
Good morning.
Good morning.

23:30.984 --> 23:33.184
Morning.

23:33.184 --> 23:36.584
I've been here having
a staff meeting, um,

23:36.584 --> 23:38.618
we've gone through
some issues this morning,

23:38.618 --> 23:41.518
that's been
bothering them,

23:41.518 --> 23:43.551
but rather than

23:43.551 --> 23:46.184
me trying to tell you
how they feel,

23:46.184 --> 23:49.218
I think
they should speak.

23:49.218 --> 23:51.218
Certainly.

23:51.218 --> 23:53.118
Who's gonna go first?

23:55.651 --> 23:55.698
I'll go first.

23:55.698 --> 23:57.784
I'll go first.

23:57.784 --> 23:59.084
I don't feel
as though we, uh,

23:59.084 --> 24:01.451
gain much respect
around here.

24:01.451 --> 24:03.484
And I don't
think that you,

24:03.484 --> 24:05.418
as an owner,
have our back.

24:07.051 --> 24:10.218
Candace, Ashley,
is that how you feel?

24:13.218 --> 24:16.284
You really do talk to us
like dirt sometimes.

24:16.284 --> 24:18.818
My intent is not
to talk down to somebody.

24:18.818 --> 24:22.318
But that's how
it comes out.

24:22.318 --> 24:25.018
Jason,
talk to Darryl,

24:25.018 --> 24:25.698
please.

24:25.698 --> 24:26.951
please.

24:26.951 --> 24:28.684
My biggest problem
that I have is just

24:28.684 --> 24:32.184
I don't think you have a clue
as to how this place runs.

24:32.184 --> 24:34.384
Me?

24:34.384 --> 24:37.051
Yeah.
Wow.

24:37.051 --> 24:38.751
I think that you're
so stuck on the numbers,

24:38.751 --> 24:41.318
the actual essence
of having a restaurant

24:41.318 --> 24:44.218
and serving good food
and giving customer service

24:44.218 --> 24:46.651
and happy employees--
that that's gone.

24:46.651 --> 24:49.184
I-I don't understand.

24:49.184 --> 24:52.151
We hear it every single night
and every single day

24:52.151 --> 24:54.351
from our customers,
what needs to be changed

24:54.351 --> 24:55.698
and why they don't come back.

24:55.698 --> 24:56.484
and why they don't come back.

24:56.484 --> 24:59.318
We let you know these things,
and you don't give a.

24:59.318 --> 25:03.018
Nothing's done.
You don't care.

25:03.018 --> 25:05.518
Wow.

25:05.518 --> 25:09.384
Pay--pay's just
ridiculous here.

25:09.384 --> 25:11.384
I really don't want
to break down,

25:11.384 --> 25:14.418
'cause I-I've been here
a long time.

25:14.418 --> 25:16.384
Mm-hmm.

25:16.384 --> 25:19.418
And I'm not getting paid
Jack.

25:19.418 --> 25:22.418
For somebody to be here
that long...

25:28.551 --> 25:31.651
I've been here
since 2006,

25:31.651 --> 25:35.184
Why haven't I never
got a pay raise?

25:35.184 --> 25:37.751
Okay, let me say
something real quick,

25:37.751 --> 25:39.518
since we're all telling
the truth--

25:39.518 --> 25:41.451
first of all,
Darryl and I have taken

25:41.451 --> 25:43.384
thousands and thousands
of dollars

25:43.384 --> 25:46.051
out of our personal account
to pay your paychecks.

25:46.051 --> 25:47.984
So why not just
close the place down?

25:47.984 --> 25:49.951
We're not giving up.
We don't want to give up.

25:49.951 --> 25:52.918
If you want to give up, that's
fine, this isn't your business.

25:52.918 --> 25:55.698
We don't want
to leave each other,

25:55.698 --> 25:55.918
We don't want
to leave each other,

25:55.918 --> 25:58.284
because we all love each other.
we don't want to leave.

25:58.284 --> 26:01.718
Not at all, but I need to make
money to support my family.

26:01.718 --> 26:03.784
You know what?
So do we.

26:03.784 --> 26:07.184
Y'all are acting like it's us
against y'all, and it's not.

26:11.384 --> 26:13.318
This is a business.
We have costs and expenses.

26:13.318 --> 26:14.884
I asked you
to take that pay cut.

26:14.884 --> 26:18.351
It's either that, or labor costs
get so high, I'm out.

26:18.351 --> 26:20.784
But you can go on five
vacations in the summer.

26:20.784 --> 26:23.384
And you're struggling
for money.
Right.

26:23.384 --> 26:25.698
That is  up.

26:25.698 --> 26:26.384
That is  up.

26:26.384 --> 26:28.951
Period.

26:28.951 --> 26:31.784
If you don't want to be here,
don't be here.

26:41.154 --> 26:43.387
After Chef Ramsay arranged

26:43.387 --> 26:45.521
for the staff
to air their grievances...

26:45.521 --> 26:48.154
I don't think you have a clue
as to how this place runs.

26:48.154 --> 26:50.621
The defiant owners
are not having any of it.

26:50.621 --> 26:52.754
If you don't want to be here,
don't be here.

26:55.420 --> 26:57.320
If I were piling up
money back there,

26:57.320 --> 26:59.387
then I could see you
being pissed off.

26:59.387 --> 27:01.320
But we're not piling up
money back there.

27:01.320 --> 27:04.287
I can't show appreciation
in dollars at this point.

27:04.287 --> 27:06.087
They maybe have
this picture of me

27:06.087 --> 27:07.796
with this pile of money going,
"Ha ha ha,

27:07.796 --> 27:08.554
with this pile of money going,
"Ha ha ha,

27:08.554 --> 27:10.387
nobody's gonna get it."
We don't have the money.

27:10.387 --> 27:12.720
I'm accepting the truth
from you guys,

27:12.720 --> 27:15.687
accept it from me, please.

27:15.687 --> 27:18.020
Things aren't going well,
I understand that,

27:18.020 --> 27:20.987
but in terms of morale,
there's an air of discontent.

27:20.987 --> 27:23.887
They feel abused. And I'm not
saying the staff are perfect,

27:23.887 --> 27:26.787
but you're the owners,
and you set an example.

27:26.787 --> 27:29.487
We have to fix
what's broken within.

27:29.487 --> 27:31.220
And--
So how about
starting over again

27:31.220 --> 27:33.654
and turning the page

27:33.654 --> 27:36.854
and the beginning
of a new chapter?

27:36.854 --> 27:37.796
I understand
those frustrations.

27:37.796 --> 27:39.520
I understand
those frustrations.

27:39.520 --> 27:42.420
You are wonderful people,
so I want you all here,

27:42.420 --> 27:46.120
and you will have my respect,
I guarantee that from me.

27:46.120 --> 27:49.754
And there's a lot of love
for you guys from Ellen and I,

27:49.754 --> 27:51.520
and I truly mean that.
Good. We did
make some progress.

27:51.520 --> 27:54.454
The air is clearer.

27:54.454 --> 27:56.887
Okay, it's a new day
here at Zeke's.

27:56.887 --> 27:59.720
I've got some ideas that
I need to, uh, put into place

27:59.720 --> 28:03.087
to really start putting
this place back on the map.

28:03.087 --> 28:05.654
- Thank you.
-  Honestly, I don't think that Darryl and Ellen

28:05.654 --> 28:07.354
heard what--
what we were saying.

28:07.354 --> 28:07.796
He was just saying
what was right

28:07.796 --> 28:08.787
He was just saying
what was right

28:08.787 --> 28:10.420
just to get Chef Ramsay
off of his back.

28:10.420 --> 28:12.387
We'll see what happens.

28:15.120 --> 28:18.587
After attempting to open
Darryl and Ellen's eyes

28:18.587 --> 28:22.020
to the staff morale problems,
Chef Ramsay has devised a plan

28:22.020 --> 28:24.187
to test the chefs
and showcase their abilities.

28:24.187 --> 28:27.220
Okay, it's been so obvious

28:27.220 --> 28:28.754
That you've been
handcuffed by Darryl.

28:28.754 --> 28:30.587
And here's what
we need to do--

28:30.587 --> 28:33.220
show Darryl
how creative,

28:33.220 --> 28:36.120
how inspirational,
how exciting you can be

28:36.120 --> 28:37.796
with seafood.
there's a grocery store

28:37.796 --> 28:38.687
with seafood.
there's a grocery store

28:38.687 --> 28:40.687
literally 2 miles
away from here, okay.

28:40.687 --> 28:42.987
Have a look at the ingredients,
get inspired,

28:42.987 --> 28:45.587
come back, get creative.
I want to see that on a plate.

28:45.587 --> 28:47.187
Yeah?
Thank you, Chef.

28:47.187 --> 28:48.654
- Good.
- Right now I'm pretty jacked up.

28:48.654 --> 28:50.687
Gordon Ramsay
said himself, said,

28:50.687 --> 28:52.287
"Jason, time for you
to be inspired.

28:52.287 --> 28:55.554
Go let it happen.
Let's see what you got."

28:55.554 --> 28:58.154
All right, let's see
what they got fresh.

28:58.154 --> 29:00.054
How may I help you?
Redfish fresh?

29:00.054 --> 29:02.254
Just put it out
hour and a half ago.
That's what
we're looking for.

29:02.254 --> 29:04.954
It's extremely liberating
to have this freedom

29:04.954 --> 29:07.796
- to showcase and do what we want to do, cook good food.
-  Very nice to meet you.

29:07.796 --> 29:08.154
- to showcase and do what we want to do, cook good food.
-  Very nice to meet you.

29:08.154 --> 29:12.020
Thanks, guys.
I am, uh, looking for red onions with asparagus.

29:12.020 --> 29:15.387
Red pepper.
This'll be the last thing I'll
get, then we're ready to ride.

29:15.387 --> 29:18.120
There it is.
There it is.
Showcase the skills.

29:21.954 --> 29:24.387
So happy?
Very happy.

29:24.387 --> 29:27.254
Think of something creative
and really let it go, yeah?
Yes, sir.

29:27.254 --> 29:29.187
Okay, off you go,
guys, yeah?

29:29.187 --> 29:32.454
I'm gonna do the chicken fried
steak at the same time, okay.

29:32.454 --> 29:33.787
Own it, yeah?
Yes, Chef.

29:33.787 --> 29:36.420
You gonna put a little
lime juice in there?

29:36.420 --> 29:37.796
Yes, more lime juice.
I'm not done yet with it.
Okay, good.

29:37.796 --> 29:39.454
Yes, more lime juice.
I'm not done yet with it.
Okay, good.

29:39.454 --> 29:41.720
Lovely idea,
the bacon and--
cheddar grits.

29:41.720 --> 29:44.020
Cheddar, nice.

29:44.020 --> 29:46.954
So in terms
of the inspiration,

29:46.954 --> 29:50.187
tell me what it is.
tried to keep it Southern
with the grits,

29:50.187 --> 29:52.254
fresh with the salmon,
and classic with the capers

29:52.254 --> 29:53.887
with the onions
with the tomatoes.
good.

29:53.887 --> 29:55.954
Keeping with the New Orleans
theme, redfish

29:55.954 --> 29:58.320
and then grilled vegetables,
fresh rice,

29:58.320 --> 30:00.920
fresh ingredients.
just a fun dish.
Pretty good job.
The difference

30:00.920 --> 30:02.920
in night and day, let me
tell you that. beautiful.

30:02.920 --> 30:05.587
Now you say nothing.
You didn't cook them.

30:05.587 --> 30:07.720
I cooked them.
Do you understand?
Yes.

30:07.720 --> 30:07.796
Okay, let's go.

30:07.796 --> 30:11.454
Okay, let's go.

30:11.454 --> 30:14.720
Come over, guys,
please.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.354
Wow, look at that.

30:16.354 --> 30:20.720
You think of Louisiana, first
thing you think of is freshness,

30:20.720 --> 30:22.454
but when I walked
into your restaurant,

30:22.454 --> 30:25.954
what I didn't expect
was frozen seafood.

30:25.954 --> 30:28.387
So I got my team to get
some ingredients for me.

30:28.387 --> 30:30.787
I'd like you both just
to have a little taste.

30:30.787 --> 30:33.287
Taste the freshness.
A beautiful char-grilled salmon

30:33.287 --> 30:36.554
done with grits.
creamy, tasty,

30:36.554 --> 30:37.796
it's absolutely
phenomenal.
then I got ahold
of some redfish,

30:37.796 --> 30:39.620
it's absolutely
phenomenal.
then I got ahold
of some redfish,

30:39.620 --> 30:41.620
marinated zucchini
with some rice

30:41.620 --> 30:43.787
and a really nice
mango salsa.

30:43.787 --> 30:45.987
Mmm.
Oh, my gosh,
this redfish is delicious.

30:45.987 --> 30:48.654
It's phenomenal.
It's absolutely phenomenal.

30:48.654 --> 30:50.520
Phenomenal?
Absolutely.

30:50.520 --> 30:52.920
Watching them eat my dish and
not knowing that it was mine

30:52.920 --> 30:55.120
and to say that,
you know, it looked like--

30:55.120 --> 30:57.920
- it was from their heart.
-  I'd like you to have a little taste

30:57.920 --> 30:59.487
of that chicken fried
steak.

30:59.487 --> 31:01.720
I just lightly pounded it
and then fried it twice,

31:01.720 --> 31:03.987
so it should just melt
in your mouth.

31:03.987 --> 31:05.953
It does melt,
literally.
Yeah?

31:05.953 --> 31:07.087
Literally melted, Chef.

31:07.087 --> 31:07.796
I couldn't believe
how good it was.

31:07.796 --> 31:08.887
I couldn't believe
how good it was.

31:08.887 --> 31:10.520
The presentation
was beautiful,

31:10.520 --> 31:13.153
and it was fresh ingredients,
and they tasted wonderful.

31:13.153 --> 31:15.520
They're all
absolutely phenomenal.
You can taste
the difference?

31:15.520 --> 31:17.620
Absolutely.
Now there's something you need to know

31:17.620 --> 31:20.953
about the seafood dishes.

31:20.953 --> 31:24.086
I didn't cook them.

31:24.086 --> 31:27.186
The two chefs
put those dishes together...

31:27.186 --> 31:29.086
Wow.
The seafood dishes--

31:29.086 --> 31:32.420
are your boys.

31:32.420 --> 31:34.720
Delicious.
Absolutely--
Wow.

31:34.720 --> 31:37.520
They really are.
They're phenomenal.
It really opened my eyes

31:37.520 --> 31:37.796
to what I-I-I wasn't letting
them do, honestly.

31:37.796 --> 31:39.553
to what I-I-I wasn't letting
them do, honestly.

31:39.553 --> 31:42.786
Food is art, and I was not
letting them create their art.

31:42.786 --> 31:44.653
These aren't just delicious,

31:44.653 --> 31:47.553
they're beautiful, and they come
from inside of you. I know that.

31:47.553 --> 31:49.686
- You did a fantastic job.
-  It feels really good that Darryl and Ellen

31:49.686 --> 31:52.620
recognize my potential,
and I think that my abilities

31:52.620 --> 31:56.020
have been shown, and hopefully,
this is the first step forward.
this is the new Zeke's.

31:56.020 --> 31:57.986
I can see that's
what we're looking for.

31:57.986 --> 32:00.420
All I could really
think to myself was,

32:00.420 --> 32:02.420
about  time
you see it.
Really good job.
Well done.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.920
- It's incredible.
- Coming up...

32:04.920 --> 32:07.796
Oh, my gosh!
It's the biggest
restaurant redesign

32:07.796 --> 32:08.386
Oh, my gosh!
It's the biggest
restaurant redesign

32:08.386 --> 32:10.653
in the history
of Kitchen Nightmares.

32:10.653 --> 32:13.686
This has surpassed anything
I could possibly imagine.

32:13.686 --> 32:15.620
But it all could be for nothing

32:15.620 --> 32:17.520
if Darryl can't stick with
Chef Ramsay's new plan.

32:17.520 --> 32:19.786
How we lookin'?
Three chops and alligator?

32:19.786 --> 32:23.320
Slow down for one minute,
let us catch up.
Everybody, stop!
Just stop!

32:29.339 --> 32:30.973
After finally having

32:30.973 --> 32:32.873
at least a small breakthrough
with the owners,

32:32.873 --> 32:36.073
Chef Ramsay decides to have
his team work through the night

32:36.073 --> 32:39.073
on the biggest restaurant
makeover they have ever done.

32:39.073 --> 32:41.106
Right, good morning.
Morning, Chef.

32:41.106 --> 32:43.606
Excited? Are you ready
to see the new Zeke's?
Yes.

32:43.606 --> 32:46.272
Let's go. Welcome
to the new Zeke's. Here we go.

32:46.272 --> 32:47.872
Oh, wow.
Come in, please.

32:47.872 --> 32:51.172
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

32:51.172 --> 32:53.805
Are you kidding me?
In, in, in!

32:53.805 --> 32:56.505
Oh, nice.
Oh, my gosh.

32:56.505 --> 32:56.945
Oh, that's nice.
Look at that.
Oh, my God.

32:56.945 --> 32:59.472
Oh, that's nice.
Look at that.
Oh, my God.

32:59.472 --> 33:01.172
Let's start
with the walls.

33:01.172 --> 33:03.372
Gone is the swamp.

33:03.372 --> 33:06.105
Look at all the--
all the old doors.

33:06.105 --> 33:08.405
Reclaimed doors,
they've got that nostalgia,

33:08.405 --> 33:11.872
and it's got that
comfort feel, right?
feels like home.

33:11.872 --> 33:13.605
Look at this!

33:13.605 --> 33:17.339
You've got the most amazing
chairs--brand-new chairs.

33:17.339 --> 33:19.872
It just feels
authentic.

33:19.872 --> 33:21.605
Let me say this, please--
please.

33:21.605 --> 33:23.539
You have found our identity.
Wonderful.

33:23.539 --> 33:25.272
Wonderful.
This is us.

33:25.272 --> 33:26.945
I'm astonished,
I mean, truly.

33:26.945 --> 33:27.472
I'm astonished,
I mean, truly.

33:27.472 --> 33:29.872
I didn't really have
any expectations,

33:29.872 --> 33:33.739
But this has surpassed anything
I could possibly imagine.

33:33.739 --> 33:35.839
There is one more thing
I'd like to show you.

33:35.839 --> 33:38.905
You're gonna start
peeing your pants.

33:38.905 --> 33:41.205
Oh, man, that's it.
Look at that.

33:41.205 --> 33:44.839
There we are--
our boil house.

33:44.839 --> 33:47.472
Oh, my gosh!

33:47.472 --> 33:50.272
From shucking your oysters
to cooking your shrimp,

33:50.272 --> 33:52.739
this is gonna be a substantial
part of the menu,

33:52.739 --> 33:55.772
and, Emil, it's gonna
take so much pressure

33:55.772 --> 33:56.945
off you and Jason.
this should just run on its own,

33:56.945 --> 33:58.605
off you and Jason.
this should just run on its own,

33:58.605 --> 34:00.205
and it should almost double
the turnover.

34:00.205 --> 34:02.305
Did I see you smile again?

34:02.305 --> 34:04.339
That's the second time
in 24 hours, huh?

34:04.339 --> 34:06.172
They're gonna arrest you
for being too happy.

34:06.172 --> 34:08.205
Chef Ramsay has given
this staff, this place,

34:08.205 --> 34:10.039
my family, our friends,
our customers,

34:10.039 --> 34:12.772
a new beginning.
it's unbelievable.

34:12.772 --> 34:15.305
Honestly, when people would
ask me where I worked,

34:15.305 --> 34:17.472
I would never say Zeke's,
I'd just say I'm a cook.
mm-hmm.

34:17.472 --> 34:19.405
Now I-I-I'm proud to say
that I work here.

34:19.405 --> 34:22.439
A new beginning
and a new identity for Zeke's.

34:22.439 --> 34:25.172
Along with making the décor
more inviting,

34:25.172 --> 34:26.945
Chef Ramsay has replaced Zeke's
outdated stale menu

34:26.945 --> 34:28.305
Chef Ramsay has replaced Zeke's
outdated stale menu

34:28.305 --> 34:30.772
with a modern update

34:30.772 --> 34:32.772
of classic
New Orleans cuisine.

34:32.772 --> 34:34.805
- Oh, my gosh.
- My goodness, me.

34:34.805 --> 34:38.105
This is gonna put Zeke's

34:38.105 --> 34:40.339
back on the map.

34:40.339 --> 34:42.405
Be careful, it's fresh.

34:42.405 --> 34:44.505
Every dish
is absolutely beautiful.

34:44.505 --> 34:46.605
Okay, let's start off,
top of the table--

34:46.605 --> 34:48.705
Zeke's house boil, yes--

34:48.705 --> 34:51.039
bucket o' shrimps, yes,
bucket o' blue crabs.

34:51.039 --> 34:54.272
A great, sharing,
festive,

34:54.272 --> 34:56.739
localized bucket.
push them, okay?

34:56.739 --> 34:56.945
Back on the menu,
the entrées--

34:56.945 --> 34:58.272
Back on the menu,
the entrées--

34:58.272 --> 35:00.439
pecan encrusted catfish

35:00.439 --> 35:03.005
served with a classic
tartar sauce and a herb salad.

35:03.005 --> 35:05.172
Country fried steak--
big hit.

35:05.172 --> 35:06.672
Say no more.
Sausage gravy.

35:06.672 --> 35:08.805
Delicious.
Slightly heated, that gravy.

35:08.805 --> 35:10.705
It's got a nice little burn
in the back of your throat.

35:10.705 --> 35:13.605
Blackened alligator,
wonderful Creole sauce,

35:13.605 --> 35:15.772
absolutely delicious.

35:15.772 --> 35:18.539
This has now become,
not the old Zeke's,

35:18.539 --> 35:20.605
your Zeke's.
thank you.

35:20.605 --> 35:22.339
You've got
your identity.

35:22.339 --> 35:24.272
Now make it yours.

35:24.272 --> 35:26.472
Absolutely incredible.
Beautiful.
Come here.

35:26.472 --> 35:26.945
Yes. Oh, thank you.
Come here.

35:26.945 --> 35:28.172
Yes. Oh, thank you.
Come here.

35:28.172 --> 35:30.239
The way chef created
the menu and the dishes,

35:30.239 --> 35:32.839
uh, they don't have a menu
like that around here.

35:32.839 --> 35:34.639
Dig in, enjoy.

35:34.639 --> 35:37.705
So not only do we have something
great to put on the table,

35:37.705 --> 35:40.572
but it's not
anywhere around.

35:40.572 --> 35:43.372
Nobody else has it.
Oh, my God,
it tastes so good.

35:43.372 --> 35:45.405
The menu is phenomenal.
I'm proud to have it

35:45.405 --> 35:47.472
and excited and can't wait
for everybody else

35:47.472 --> 35:49.305
to come in and try it.
it's delicious.

35:49.305 --> 35:51.239
I feel right now
we have the most diverse

35:51.239 --> 35:53.205
Louisiana Southern menu,

35:53.205 --> 35:55.705
I mean, we very well
may have the best menu.

35:55.705 --> 35:56.945
Rich in flavor,
rich in texture. Wow.

35:56.945 --> 35:58.339
Rich in flavor,
rich in texture. Wow.

36:01.572 --> 36:03.405
Hi, guys, welcome to Zeke's.

36:03.405 --> 36:05.539
The community of Metairie
had a love affair

36:05.539 --> 36:08.139
with this restaurant
that went sour...

36:08.139 --> 36:10.005
Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy.
Shrimps are amazing.

36:10.005 --> 36:12.672
Chef Ramsay's revamp
and tonight's relaunch

36:12.672 --> 36:15.639
will be a strong indicator
if it's possible

36:15.639 --> 36:17.572
for this love affair to resume.

36:21.305 --> 36:23.405
And with so many changes
in place,

36:23.405 --> 36:25.272
and so many people
in the dining room,

36:25.272 --> 36:26.945
Chef Ramsay is hoping
the boil house

36:26.945 --> 36:27.272
Chef Ramsay is hoping
the boil house

36:27.272 --> 36:29.905
will take some of the pressure
off the kitchen.

36:29.905 --> 36:32.439
Any, uh, any orders
over there in the boil house?
No.

36:32.439 --> 36:33.905
Nothing in the boil house,
already,

36:33.905 --> 36:35.872
so get hold of the waitresses,
call them in, and say,

36:35.872 --> 36:38.272
"Right, start pushing them."
We've gotta use that place.

36:38.272 --> 36:40.105
Gotta get used to that.
Let's go.

36:40.105 --> 36:41.672
Rachel, sell boil food.
I'm trying.

36:41.672 --> 36:43.705
Sell one, okay. Sell one
to a big table, please?

36:43.705 --> 36:45.772
Tonight we have
a, um, special,

36:45.772 --> 36:47.772
it's boiled lobster for two.

36:47.772 --> 36:50.305
And I don't know
if you saw it on the menu,

36:50.305 --> 36:54.372
but we sell it
by the bucket.
two comin' right up.

36:54.372 --> 36:56.272
Two buckets of lobster
for table five.

36:56.272 --> 36:56.945
Can I get two buckets
of lobster, please?

36:56.945 --> 36:58.739
Can I get two buckets
of lobster, please?

36:58.739 --> 37:00.805
Put a little bit
of butter on there,

37:00.805 --> 37:03.405
give it a nice
little glaze, okay. Good.

37:03.405 --> 37:05.739
That's it.
Two lobsters, let's go.
Look what I have
for y'all.

37:05.739 --> 37:08.639
Y'all enjoy.
It looks good.

37:08.639 --> 37:10.839
- Wow.
-  With the boil house now being utilized...

37:10.839 --> 37:13.572
It's good.
And satisfying customers...

37:13.572 --> 37:16.105
It's really good.
It's clearly allowed
some breathing room

37:16.105 --> 37:19.339
for the kitchen.
8 minutes on baked crab,
that's 33.

37:19.339 --> 37:22.239
However, it's now up to Darryl
to manage the time wisely.

37:22.239 --> 37:24.172
I worked hard today.
Let's make it happen.

37:24.172 --> 37:25.872
You've gotta focus
on that window.

37:25.872 --> 37:26.945
Communicate
with these guys.

37:26.945 --> 37:27.539
Communicate
with these guys.

37:27.539 --> 37:29.472
One table leaving,
one table working,

37:29.472 --> 37:31.505
so we don't get
bogged down, yes?
Yes, Chef.

37:31.505 --> 37:35.039
I need an alligator.
I need a strip.

37:35.039 --> 37:37.205
Give me three minutes
on that.
Let's go!

37:37.205 --> 37:39.939
We need to put food up there
and cook it as fast as we can.

37:39.939 --> 37:42.805
Green tomatoes, char-grilled
oysters, I need it fast.
Let's work one at a time.

37:42.805 --> 37:45.639
It's not a race.
How we lookin'--
three chops and an alligator?

37:45.639 --> 37:48.205
Hold on one second,
Darryl.
Smothered chop,
how we lookin'?

37:48.205 --> 37:50.472
Darryl, slow down for
one minute, let us catch up.

37:50.472 --> 37:53.739
- Hell.
-  With Darryl calling multiple tickets

37:53.739 --> 37:56.805
at the same time...
grits, mash,
sweet potatoes!

37:56.805 --> 37:56.945
And more focused on speed
than anything else...

37:56.945 --> 37:59.539
And more focused on speed
than anything else...

37:59.539 --> 38:01.172
What ticket
is it for?

38:01.172 --> 38:03.439
The kitchen is now
completely confused.

38:03.439 --> 38:05.705
How's my
pecan catfish?

38:05.705 --> 38:07.905
Where's my New York strip?
It's gotta go.

38:07.905 --> 38:09.972
Just put 'em in the window,

38:09.972 --> 38:12.872
and we'll figure out
how to plate 'em.
Yes, whatever
you've got.

38:12.872 --> 38:16.139
- Make sure it's done, huh?
-  I was being told that I need this, this, and this right now,

38:16.139 --> 38:18.439
and I just try and move as fast
as I can and get the food out.

38:22.639 --> 38:24.405
No garnish?
No.

38:24.405 --> 38:26.172
Goes in the window
like that.

38:26.172 --> 38:26.945
Darryl has managed

38:26.945 --> 38:27.905
Darryl has managed

38:27.905 --> 38:30.105
to get the cooks
producing the food

38:30.105 --> 38:32.039
at a much quicker pace...
Thank you.

38:34.605 --> 38:36.539
But the dishes
are not at the level

38:36.539 --> 38:38.672
that they should be.

38:38.672 --> 38:40.572
Sorry, is that--
is that cooked?
Eh.

38:40.572 --> 38:43.739
It's not, is it? Excuse me.
Can I get you another one, sir?
Sure.

38:43.739 --> 38:45.206
Yeah.

38:45.206 --> 38:47.872
Guys, the fish is raw.

38:47.872 --> 38:50.272
Not tonight.
Just--just stop.
Oh, man.

38:50.272 --> 38:52.472
24 is out!
Everybody stop!

38:52.472 --> 38:54.372
What a joke.

39:03.520 --> 39:05.520
It's relaunch night at Zeke's...

39:05.520 --> 39:07.920
Smothered chop,
how we lookin'?
Darryl, slow down
for one minute,

39:07.920 --> 39:11.120
let us catch up, huh?
And with Darryl pushing
the cooks,

39:11.120 --> 39:13.520
food is leaving
the kitchen quickly...
Can I get you
another one, sir?

39:13.520 --> 39:16.754
Sure.
Unfortunately, it's also
coming back quickly.

39:16.754 --> 39:20.087
Guys, the fish is raw.

39:20.087 --> 39:22.020
Not tonight.
Just stop.
Oh, man.

39:22.020 --> 39:23.887
Everybody stop!

39:23.887 --> 39:26.754
Emil, Jason, come around.

39:26.754 --> 39:28.787
I'd rather be three,
four minutes later

39:28.787 --> 39:30.038
than rush food out there
and the  coming back.

39:30.038 --> 39:31.420
than rush food out there
and the  coming back.

39:31.420 --> 39:33.854
- Not tonight.
- An expediter should definitely

39:33.854 --> 39:35.587
set the tone for the rest
of the kitchen.

39:35.587 --> 39:37.354
I think Darryl
lost control of that.

39:37.354 --> 39:39.354
Uh, it's just
a big catastrophe.

39:39.354 --> 39:42.587
What we've got to do is focus
on one table at a time.

39:42.587 --> 39:44.820
We've got to communicate.
Darryl, talk to me.

39:44.820 --> 39:46.920
Don't get swamped.
Where you at?

39:46.920 --> 39:50.220
Darryl,
what table you on?
Darryl,
take responsibility.

39:50.220 --> 39:53.320
I had to stop,

39:53.320 --> 39:55.120
refocus, let's get these
tickets out one at a time.

39:55.120 --> 39:57.387
I need to do a better job
of communicating, very simply.

39:57.387 --> 39:59.720
All right, guys,
let's focus.
Where you at now,
Darryl?

39:59.720 --> 40:00.038
Pecan catfish
and blackened alligator.

40:00.038 --> 40:01.787
Pecan catfish
and blackened alligator.

40:01.787 --> 40:04.287
In his hand, Darryl.
Table one,
let's go.

40:04.287 --> 40:07.587
Move to the next ticket.
I got 33, blackened alligator,
pecan catfish.

40:07.587 --> 40:10.487
Comin' right now,
Darryl.
Let's go!

40:10.487 --> 40:12.754
Following Chef Ramsay's advice

40:12.754 --> 40:14.820
Of focusing on one table
at a time...
What table you on?

40:14.820 --> 40:17.320
All right, table ten.
Mac and cheese,
grits is up.

40:17.320 --> 40:20.987
Darryl and the chefs
are now in sync.
Please, let's get this
to, uh, 31.

40:20.987 --> 40:23.220
Blackened alligator.
Awesome.

40:23.220 --> 40:26.287
- Shrimp and grits.
-  Perfectly cooked dishes are leaving the kitchen...

40:26.287 --> 40:29.820
That's very good.
And are being enjoyed
by thrilled customers.

40:29.820 --> 40:30.038
That's delicious.
Fox News are here.

40:30.038 --> 40:32.487
That's delicious.
Fox News are here.

40:32.487 --> 40:34.354
Now that this restaurant
is on its way

40:34.354 --> 40:36.154
To a successful relaunch...
Hi.

40:36.154 --> 40:38.187
Chef Ramsay is ready
to spread the word.

40:38.187 --> 40:40.354
What happened with
the restaurant before?

40:40.354 --> 40:42.554
Why did you come here?
This place was legendary,

40:42.554 --> 40:44.520
um, it lost its way.
it's now back on the map,

40:44.520 --> 40:47.320
and two new owners that
are gonna start their own

40:47.320 --> 40:50.154
beginning of a new chapter.
what is the feedback you're
already getting for tonight?

40:50.154 --> 40:51.787
That the food
is fantastic.

40:51.787 --> 40:53.587
I mean, the menu--
it's fabulous.

40:53.587 --> 40:55.554
Highly recommend that
you come in and try it.

40:55.554 --> 40:57.354
Let's finish,
let's finish.

40:57.354 --> 40:58.887
Somebody get this
to 14, please.
I will.

40:58.887 --> 41:00.038
No more tickets comin' in.
Let's get this stuff outta here.

41:00.038 --> 41:02.020
No more tickets comin' in.
Let's get this stuff outta here.

41:02.020 --> 41:04.987
Delicious.

41:04.987 --> 41:07.054
- That's a wrap, Jack.
- The end of the night,

41:07.054 --> 41:08.720
the way it ended,
made you feel good.

41:08.720 --> 41:10.820
I think Darryl showed
more personality tonight

41:10.820 --> 41:12.754
than he showed
in the last few years.

41:12.754 --> 41:14.787
We still have some
improvements to make,

41:14.787 --> 41:17.420
but you can see
it's on the right track.
nice job.

41:17.420 --> 41:20.254
Good night, ladies.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

41:20.254 --> 41:22.820
Okay,

41:22.820 --> 41:24.754
tonight was about
establishing a new Zeke's.

41:24.754 --> 41:26.854
And you achieved it.

41:26.854 --> 41:28.620
Yes, yes.

41:28.620 --> 41:30.038
It's my first time
in New Orleans.

41:30.038 --> 41:31.020
It's my first time
in New Orleans.

41:31.020 --> 41:33.920
me,
did you give me a challenge.

41:33.920 --> 41:36.254
Okay?

41:36.254 --> 41:38.187
If Chef Ramsay
told me a week ago

41:38.187 --> 41:40.220
that all these changes
were gonna happen...

41:40.220 --> 41:43.254
Right on, my darling.
I don't think I would have
really believed it.

41:43.254 --> 41:45.154
May I just have
a quick word with you two?

41:45.154 --> 41:46.887
Amazing.

41:46.887 --> 41:49.920
Look at this place.
The potential's huge.

41:49.920 --> 41:52.754
I know.
Fantastic.

41:52.754 --> 41:54.820
It's now your Zeke's.
Run with it.

41:54.820 --> 41:57.254
And, Darryl,
you do care.

41:57.254 --> 41:59.620
And you do have a heart--
a big heart.

41:59.620 --> 42:00.038
Show it to your staff.
Indeed, I will.

42:00.038 --> 42:02.754
Show it to your staff.
Indeed, I will.

42:02.754 --> 42:05.387
Don't--don't hide that.
I'm ready to do--do things
the right way,

42:05.387 --> 42:08.687
ready to get moving.
It's a new--it's a new life.

42:08.687 --> 42:09.987
It's new energy.
Good job.

42:09.987 --> 42:11.787
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

42:11.787 --> 42:15.187
Good night. Good night,
good night, good night.
Thanks, Chef.

42:15.187 --> 42:17.787
Whew.

42:17.787 --> 42:20.254
We had a lot of issues here
when I first arrived.

42:20.254 --> 42:22.187
The staff were at war
with the owners,

42:22.187 --> 42:24.187
the food was miserable,
and the restaurant

42:24.187 --> 42:26.287
was seriously struggling
for an identity.

42:26.287 --> 42:28.720
But what I witnessed
was a phenomenal comeback,

42:28.720 --> 42:30.038
and how fitting is that?
that it took place here,

42:30.038 --> 42:31.687
and how fitting is that?
that it took place here,

42:31.687 --> 42:34.654
in the most resilient city
across America--

42:34.654 --> 42:37.754
New Orleans.

42:37.754 --> 42:40.654
Week-old lasagna,
not so special.

42:42.887 --> 42:45.653
In the weeks that followed,

42:45.653 --> 42:48.053
a glowing report
on the local news...
As a family, as a restaurant,
it's back on the map.

42:48.053 --> 42:51.387
Brought a surge of customers
to the restaurant.

42:51.387 --> 42:54.453
Hi, how are y'all?
Darryl and Ellen
are doing their best

42:54.453 --> 42:57.387
to raise staff morale.
you all did
an excellent job.

42:57.387 --> 42:59.587
I can't do this
without you guys.

42:59.587 --> 43:00.038
And a reaching out
to the community...

43:00.038 --> 43:01.487
And a reaching out
to the community...

43:01.487 --> 43:03.553
We really thank you all for
coming. That means a lot to us.

43:03.553 --> 43:06.553
Thanks.
Put Zeke's
back on the map.
