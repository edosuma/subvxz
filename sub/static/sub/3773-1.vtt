01:28:38.781 --> 01:28:41.381
    Well, so we've only got

01:28:41.617 --> 01:28:43.517
  10 minutes thinking time?

01:28:43.819 --> 01:28:45.252
             Yeah.

01:28:46.789 --> 01:28:48.288
            (SIGHS)

01:28:48.957 --> 01:28:50.324
             Look.

01:28:50.326 --> 01:28:51.758
      Before we do this,

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:54.594
     are we really going to
     go through with it?

01:28:54.596 --> 01:28:58.165
  I really think if I win,
  I can't shoot you, Mitch.

01:28:58.167 --> 01:29:00.734
      Well, I'm gonna
      fucking shoot you.

01:29:03.138 --> 01:29:04.137
             Yeah.

01:29:04.139 --> 01:29:06.473
 You know what I mean, mate.

01:29:06.475 --> 01:29:10.610
  This, this thing was never
  going to end well, was it?

01:29:10.846 --> 01:29:15.048
 Mitch, I'm so sorry
 I asked you to get into this.

01:29:15.351 --> 01:29:16.883
         I am sorry.

01:29:18.053 --> 01:29:20.754
      We couldn't ignore
      what happened.

01:29:24.693 --> 01:29:26.593
      I enjoyed the job.

01:29:26.595 --> 01:29:29.296
    (CHUCKLES)
    Just like the old days.

01:29:31.767 --> 01:29:33.900
      Yeah. It was fun.

01:29:39.141 --> 01:29:41.475
  Let's just get on with it.

01:29:50.519 --> 01:29:52.986
        (CLOCK TICKING)

01:29:57.126 --> 01:30:00.794
     Illegal move,
     you brain-dead punks.

01:30:01.497 --> 01:30:03.397
          (BEEPING)

01:30:03.966 --> 01:30:05.999
         What the fuck?

01:30:07.736 --> 01:30:08.602
             Oh.

01:30:08.604 --> 01:30:13.774
 I think the pawns
 move forward, not diagonal.

01:30:16.678 --> 01:30:18.445
        I forgot. Sorry.

01:30:18.914 --> 01:30:20.313
             Sorry?

01:30:20.849 --> 01:30:21.948
        FLOYD: Your go.

01:30:21.950 --> 01:30:25.352
        So, two moves...
        Two spaces, yeah?

01:30:25.954 --> 01:30:27.287
             Yeah.

01:30:45.674 --> 01:30:48.408
     Can any of these jump
     over the pawns?

01:30:48.410 --> 01:30:50.243
 The knights, and the bishops.

01:30:50.245 --> 01:30:54.481
 The bishops are these ones.
 They go diagonally.

01:31:02.925 --> 01:31:04.691
          (BEEPING)

01:31:06.662 --> 01:31:08.862
          Oh, fuck.

01:31:11.166 --> 01:31:12.532
             Fuck!

01:31:13.569 --> 01:31:17.704
     Fuck! We lost another
     20 seconds.

01:31:19.274 --> 01:31:20.841
      We can't carry on
      like this, mate.

01:31:20.843 --> 01:31:23.477
      We're both gonna
      get blown to shit.

01:31:29.151 --> 01:31:31.685
      (BREATHES HEAVILY)

01:31:39.027 --> 01:31:40.694
         Sorry, mate.

01:31:55.811 --> 01:31:58.578
 No! One space forward, mate.

01:31:58.580 --> 01:32:01.181
 It's only two on the first go.

01:32:01.250 --> 01:32:02.883
          All right.

01:32:14.329 --> 01:32:15.795
            (SIGHS)

01:32:20.736 --> 01:32:23.169
        -(TIMER BEEPS)
        -What the fuck?

01:32:35.083 --> 01:32:38.785
  Mate. We're fucking toast.

01:32:39.388 --> 01:32:41.555
     This ain't gonna work.

01:32:42.391 --> 01:32:44.190
          (EXHALES)

01:32:45.193 --> 01:32:46.426
            I know.

01:32:46.428 --> 01:32:49.229
     Your move.
     The clock's ticking.

01:33:18.093 --> 01:33:19.492
             Fuck!

01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:37.444
        (TICKING STOPS)

01:33:46.021 --> 01:33:49.389
 That was never gonna happen,
 was it?

01:33:49.691 --> 01:33:52.525
 No point in both of us dying.

01:34:07.976 --> 01:34:10.043
          (BEEPING)

01:34:34.836 --> 01:34:36.569
          It's okay.

01:34:37.806 --> 01:34:40.206
     Kill him! Kill him!

01:34:41.209 --> 01:34:42.709
             Do it!

01:34:47.416 --> 01:34:48.715
             Do it!

01:36:42.330 --> 01:36:44.964
      FLOYD: <i> Sometimes,</i>

01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:48.368
  <i> life deals you a bad hand.</i>

01:36:50.338 --> 01:36:54.007
     <i> This game we all play</i>
     <i> turns ugly</i>

01:36:56.244 --> 01:36:58.411

      <i> But survival is</i>
      <i> not enough for me.</i>
