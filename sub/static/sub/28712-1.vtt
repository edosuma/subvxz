WEBVTT

00:01.375 --> 00:04.475
In the most remote place on Earth

00:04.500 --> 00:09.072
recent discoveries have left
scientists stunned.

00:09.074 --> 00:11.634
Giorgio Tsoukalos:
Something is going on there,

00:11.661 --> 00:14.152
and the question is: What?

00:14.247 --> 00:17.589
There were shockwaves in 2018
when we realized

00:17.591 --> 00:20.834
radiation was coming
from the South Pole.

00:20.995 --> 00:23.361
Narrator:
After thousands of years

00:23.422 --> 00:25.330
hidden by thick ice

00:25.332 --> 00:27.708
and protected by
deadly temperatures,

00:27.802 --> 00:32.688
the truth about Antarctica
may finally be revealed.

00:32.689 --> 00:35.491
This is a legitimate
satellite image

00:35.518 --> 00:39.469
of a very large hole
in the mountain range.

00:39.564 --> 00:41.196
Narrator:
What secret lies beneath

00:41.198 --> 00:43.682
the Earth's most unexplored continent?

00:43.842 --> 00:45.701
Here we have a huge

00:45.703 --> 00:48.921
underground world beneath Antarctica.

00:48.948 --> 00:51.674
Narrator:
And what will we find out about

00:51.701 --> 00:54.677
mankind's true origins?

00:54.704 --> 00:56.932
William Henry: Buried
underneath the ice in Antarctica

00:56.956 --> 00:59.439
could well be the greatest reveal

00:59.500 --> 01:01.041
in all of human history.

01:04.830 --> 01:08.423
Narrator: There is a
doorway in the universe.

01:08.425 --> 01:12.711
Beyond it is the promise of truth.

01:12.805 --> 01:15.197
It demands we question everything

01:15.224 --> 01:17.924
we have ever been taught.

01:18.019 --> 01:21.495
The evidence is all around us.

01:21.522 --> 01:25.416
The future is right
before our eyes.

01:25.443 --> 01:28.027
We are not alone.

01:28.187 --> 01:31.530
We have never been alone.

01:43.544 --> 01:47.980
Narrator:
Ross island, Antarctica.

01:48.007 --> 01:51.567
This volcanic landmass
at the bottom of the world

01:51.594 --> 01:54.160
is the site of one of
the greatest mysteries

01:54.221 --> 01:56.338
of modern physics.

01:56.498 --> 01:59.975
It is here that in may of 2018,

02:00.135 --> 02:01.802
NASA scientists

02:01.896 --> 02:05.013
working on the Antarctic
Impulsive Transient Antenna,

02:05.107 --> 02:07.716
otherwise known as Anita,
detected an anomaly

02:07.777 --> 02:10.285
that defies the laws of physics.

02:10.287 --> 02:14.131
Cosmic rays, which normally
rain down on Earth from space,

02:14.158 --> 02:19.286
were instead erupting
out of the ground.

02:19.446 --> 02:23.156
Among physicists,
there were shockwaves in 2018

02:23.316 --> 02:25.512
when we realized that
a strange form of radiation

02:25.536 --> 02:27.770
was coming from the South Pole.

02:27.797 --> 02:31.423
We physicists said, "what kind
of particle could this be?"

02:31.583 --> 02:33.408
This is new.

02:33.469 --> 02:35.063
John Brandenburg:
You would expect

02:35.087 --> 02:37.996
high-energy neutrinos would be
raining down from the sky,

02:38.057 --> 02:40.866
but not coming up from the Earth,

02:40.893 --> 02:44.152
but that's exactly what they found.

02:44.154 --> 02:47.514
The fact that cosmic rays

02:47.608 --> 02:52.169
were measured coming out of
the Earth begs the question:

02:52.196 --> 02:54.988
How is such a thing possible?

02:54.990 --> 02:59.659
Antarctica, to this day, remains
one of the last unexplored

02:59.661 --> 03:02.353
geographical regions of our planet.

03:02.415 --> 03:04.932
It is still one of
the greatest mysteries

03:04.959 --> 03:06.750
with which we are faced today.

03:10.256 --> 03:13.364
Narrator: Antarctica
is a land of extremes.

03:13.426 --> 03:17.903
Nearly 98% of the ground
is covered by an ice sheet

03:18.063 --> 03:19.921
up to three miles thick.

03:20.081 --> 03:23.708
A mountain as towering
as Japan's mount Fuji,

03:23.769 --> 03:28.622
at 12,400 feet, would not even
break the surface.

03:28.649 --> 03:31.716
Temperatures regularly fall

03:31.777 --> 03:33.885
below minus-50 degrees fahrenheit

03:33.946 --> 03:36.922
with winds of up to 200 miles an hour.

03:36.949 --> 03:40.350
During its peak season, it is home

03:40.411 --> 03:45.305
to only 4,000 scientists
and military personnel.

03:45.332 --> 03:47.982
Antarctica is the last frontier.

03:48.043 --> 03:51.003
It holds our imagination.

03:51.163 --> 03:55.132
Old maps that said, "here be monsters."

03:55.292 --> 03:58.343
The last remaining
territory on the planet

03:58.504 --> 04:01.263
that could have such a
designation is Antarctica.

04:03.642 --> 04:07.619
Narrator: Although it was
discovered nearly 250 years ago,

04:07.646 --> 04:10.113
scientists have more
questions than answers

04:10.115 --> 04:14.001
when it comes to this frozen continent.

04:14.028 --> 04:17.478
Due to the sheer depth of
the ice covering its landmass,

04:17.481 --> 04:20.048
the surface of Antarctica is unable

04:20.208 --> 04:22.117
to be seen with the naked eye.

04:22.277 --> 04:25.178
And ancient astronaut theorists propose

04:25.206 --> 04:29.491
that it is not just the geology
that is hidden from us.

04:29.651 --> 04:33.061
They suggest there is far more human,

04:33.088 --> 04:35.105
and perhaps non-human, activity

04:35.132 --> 04:40.435
happening in Antarctica
than we've been told.

04:40.437 --> 04:43.447
Something seems to be going on

04:43.474 --> 04:46.182
on this mysterious
continent at the South Pole.

04:46.184 --> 04:48.793
And it has been theorized
by a number of people

04:48.854 --> 04:53.047
that Antarctica is
some kind of alien base.

04:53.108 --> 04:57.269
Narrator: Rumors of extraterrestrial
activity in Antarctica

04:57.363 --> 04:59.571
have circulated for years.

04:59.731 --> 05:03.942
And now, at long last,
military personnel

05:04.036 --> 05:06.276
who have been stationed
on the frozen continent

05:06.363 --> 05:10.207
are willing to speak to these claims.

05:12.253 --> 05:16.654
Scottsdale, Arizona.
February 2019.

05:16.715 --> 05:20.083
Investigative journalist
Linda Moulton Howe

05:20.177 --> 05:22.469
arrives to conduct an
interview with a former

05:22.629 --> 05:26.031
Navy flight engineer who has
come forward with information

05:26.058 --> 05:28.091
about strange events he witnessed

05:28.185 --> 05:31.019
during his time in Antarctica.

05:31.179 --> 05:34.505
This is where one of the most
important whistleblowers

05:34.567 --> 05:36.984
in my career lives,

05:37.144 --> 05:41.146
and he has decided that he
is willing to work with me

05:41.240 --> 05:46.410
to tell the truth about what
happened with him in Antarctica.

05:46.570 --> 05:49.621
This is the kind of breakthrough
I have been hoping

05:49.781 --> 05:53.558
that people with real,
solid military information

05:53.586 --> 05:56.169
would start coming forward,
and we would start learning

05:56.330 --> 05:58.563
the facts and the truth,

05:58.591 --> 06:01.908
in spite of government
policies of denial.

06:02.069 --> 06:03.780
I knew things that

06:03.804 --> 06:06.838
I-I felt needed to be

06:06.932 --> 06:09.016
put out in the mainstream.

06:09.176 --> 06:12.452
Narrator: "Brian," as
he prefers to be called,

06:12.479 --> 06:15.188
requested that his face
and voice be obscured

06:15.190 --> 06:17.048
to protect his identity.

06:17.109 --> 06:21.044
His unit was based on the
Southern tip of Ross island

06:21.071 --> 06:22.779
at the U.S. McMurdo station,

06:22.940 --> 06:26.099
the main logistics hub
that services nearly all

06:26.160 --> 06:29.694
of the scientific outposts
on the continent.

06:29.854 --> 06:32.781
Brian, when did you get
into the Navy

06:32.875 --> 06:35.075
and wh... how did you get
to Antarctica?

06:35.169 --> 06:39.788
I enlisted in July of 1976.

06:39.882 --> 06:45.344
In order to go to Antarctica,
you have to volunteer.

06:45.504 --> 06:48.513
It's not a, uh, duty station
where you are ordered to go.

06:48.674 --> 06:50.256
I was able to get orders

06:50.417 --> 06:53.644
to, um, Antarctica development
squadron six,

06:53.804 --> 06:57.147
which was referred to as vxe-6.

06:57.307 --> 07:00.943
And its mission would be
described as what, generally?

07:01.103 --> 07:04.337
The mission basically
was supplying

07:04.365 --> 07:06.965
to outcamps, uh, science parties

07:06.992 --> 07:10.577
from McMurdo station to
South Pole, back and forth.

07:10.737 --> 07:13.697
Talk about sort of the route,

07:13.791 --> 07:16.291
and what you guys began to see

07:16.451 --> 07:19.352
on a repeated basis.

07:19.380 --> 07:23.190
During our '95, '96 season,

07:23.217 --> 07:27.110
my crew was doing a lot
of back and forth to pole.

07:27.137 --> 07:29.629
Mainly it was cargo resupply,

07:29.723 --> 07:32.290
personnel exchanges.

07:32.351 --> 07:35.276
That season,
prior to us doing missions,

07:35.278 --> 07:38.588
we were told by
some of our officers

07:38.649 --> 07:41.349
that if we saw something flying,

07:41.443 --> 07:44.152
that we weren't supposed
to say anything.

07:44.154 --> 07:46.088
- Okay.
- Oh, so you knew that...

07:46.115 --> 07:47.759
- Brian: Well...
- ...People had...

07:47.783 --> 07:50.553
- Were already warning about,
but you had not seen it.  - Yeah.

07:50.577 --> 07:52.652
Right, so, somewhere
around December,

07:52.654 --> 07:55.296
uh, we were flying
a mission from McMurdo,

07:55.298 --> 07:57.866
and my loadmaster in the back,

07:57.960 --> 08:01.161
he gets on the intercom on the
ics and he says, "hey, there's"

08:01.255 --> 08:03.980
something off to the left here
kind of shimmering."

08:04.008 --> 08:05.690
So I went up to the flight deck,

08:05.718 --> 08:07.445
and I'm looking out
the big windows

08:07.469 --> 08:10.462
and I see these little
disc-shaped objects.

08:10.556 --> 08:13.056
There was probably
four or five of them,

08:13.216 --> 08:15.875
and they were, at first,
when I first saw them,

08:15.936 --> 08:19.879
they were just stationary
over one mountain peak.

08:19.940 --> 08:23.308
And then, all of a sudden, I'm
looking at them and one of them

08:23.402 --> 08:26.811
takes off by itself and flies
at incredible speed

08:26.905 --> 08:29.631
to the next mountaintop
and stops.

08:29.658 --> 08:31.678
And then another one
in the group takes off

08:31.702 --> 08:34.568
and heads toward
where the first one went.

08:34.663 --> 08:36.871
What did the pilot say?

08:37.032 --> 08:38.688
That was kind of funny.

08:38.751 --> 08:42.419
My pilot gets on the intercom
and he-he kind of jokingly goes,

08:42.578 --> 08:45.147
"Well, all I can tell
you is they're not ours."

08:45.174 --> 08:47.573
Not ours, what are you
talking about?

08:47.634 --> 08:49.300
And it kept happening?

08:49.302 --> 08:51.661
Yes, it happened
at least two other times.

08:51.722 --> 08:56.216
Howe: Brian feels that
it is really important

08:56.310 --> 08:58.885
that the world know
that there is something

08:58.979 --> 09:01.538
that is going on in Antarctica.

09:01.565 --> 09:04.457
Narrator: Is it possible
that Brian's sighting

09:04.485 --> 09:06.793
of unidentified flying objects

09:06.820 --> 09:09.720
may be somehow connected to
the discovery that cosmic rays

09:09.782 --> 09:13.558
are emanating
from the frozen continent?

09:13.619 --> 09:17.596
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

09:17.623 --> 09:19.598
Antarctica is not only

09:19.758 --> 09:24.077
hiding secrets about current
extraterrestrial activities,

09:24.171 --> 09:27.321
they believe there is much more
to be learned

09:27.382 --> 09:31.026
by examining incredible
new discoveries

09:31.053 --> 09:33.929
deep underground.

09:39.269 --> 09:41.477
Some of these caverns were thermally
heatedy, satellite photography

09:41.479 --> 09:44.873
has allowed anyone
with an Internet connection

09:44.900 --> 09:47.818
to access images of Antarctica.

09:47.978 --> 09:52.823
In 2016, a striking image
was discovered

09:52.983 --> 09:55.066
of a seemingly man-made
entrance carved

09:55.160 --> 09:57.986
into an Antarctic
mountain range.

09:58.080 --> 10:00.889
This is a legitimate
satellite image

10:00.916 --> 10:04.167
of a very large, proportionate

10:04.327 --> 10:06.645
hole in the ground,
or the mountain range.

10:06.672 --> 10:09.405
This looks
intelligently designed

10:09.466 --> 10:13.042
to suit a specific craft
that flies

10:13.137 --> 10:14.970
through this particular opening.

10:15.130 --> 10:18.698
Narrator:
Similarly, in 2018,

10:18.725 --> 10:21.109
Internet researchers
released the coordinates

10:21.111 --> 10:24.545
for what they describe
as a ufo crash-landed

10:24.606 --> 10:27.190
on the Antarctic island
of South Georgia.

10:29.419 --> 10:32.320
The photographs
are really compelling.

10:32.480 --> 10:33.771
Because this is not somebody

10:33.866 --> 10:35.573
making believe
something is there.

10:35.575 --> 10:38.726
You can actually
see the skid marks.

10:38.787 --> 10:41.062
It actually looks
as though an object

10:41.123 --> 10:43.306
is moving along that ice.

10:43.333 --> 10:46.935
But the thing
that so intrigued people

10:46.962 --> 10:49.137
looking at those images,

10:49.139 --> 10:51.179
were that the skid marks
were straight.

10:52.843 --> 10:54.963
Narrator:
Some ancient astronaut theorists

10:55.012 --> 10:57.904
have noted that the shape
of the alleged craft

10:57.931 --> 11:01.040
is very similar
to a mysterious celestial object

11:01.101 --> 11:06.621
that was detected entering our
solar system in October 2017.

11:06.648 --> 11:09.590
Called "Oumuamua", the object

11:09.651 --> 11:11.759
was initially identified
as an asteroid.

11:11.820 --> 11:15.471
But its shape, trajectory
and acceleration

11:15.532 --> 11:18.074
were so unexpected

11:18.235 --> 11:20.129
that the chair of Harvard's
astronomy department,

11:20.153 --> 11:22.704
Avi Loeb, suggested that Oumuamua

11:22.864 --> 11:26.683
might be an alien probe.

11:26.710 --> 11:29.480
Childress: It's a very
curious image of this...

11:29.504 --> 11:33.423
Large, oblong,
tubular-shaped craft

11:33.583 --> 11:35.917
that seems to have
crashed into the ice

11:36.011 --> 11:38.177
and then skidded along.

11:38.179 --> 11:42.832
And it really looks like
this interstellar asteroid,

11:42.893 --> 11:47.561
Oumuamua, that could easily
be a spacecraft.

11:47.563 --> 11:50.923
The actual craft itself
is right around

11:50.984 --> 11:53.059
50 yards, uh, in length.

11:53.153 --> 11:58.548
This is the wider view of this
object that quite possibly

11:58.575 --> 12:02.393
came in at an angle,
ricocheted off of the base

12:02.454 --> 12:05.238
of this mountain and that's
what gave it the momentum

12:05.332 --> 12:08.208
to skid several thousands
of feet.

12:08.368 --> 12:09.971
You can definitely see the
mountain, there's some

12:09.995 --> 12:13.879
disturbance here,
where this track leads back to,

12:13.881 --> 12:17.600
from this unidentified object.

12:17.602 --> 12:19.952
This very well could be
a crash landing based off

12:20.013 --> 12:22.271
of what we're seeing at the
bottom of the mountain, yeah.

12:22.273 --> 12:25.566
Narrator: Is it possible
that online researchers

12:25.568 --> 12:27.202
using satellite technology

12:27.229 --> 12:29.396
actually located
the crashed remnants

12:29.556 --> 12:31.881
of an extraterrestrial vehicle

12:31.942 --> 12:35.217
and the opening
to an underground alien base?

12:35.279 --> 12:38.220
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

12:38.282 --> 12:40.840
and point to shocking
disclosures

12:40.867 --> 12:43.868
from those on the ground that
validate these claims.

12:46.506 --> 12:49.940
When investigative journalist
Linda Moulton Howe

12:50.002 --> 12:52.294
interviewed a former
Navy flight engineer

12:52.454 --> 12:56.080
going by the name
of Brian in 2019,

12:56.082 --> 12:59.818
he revealed a very curious
no-fly zone he came upon

12:59.845 --> 13:02.211
during his service
in Antarctica.

13:02.306 --> 13:07.267
According to Brian,
sometime around October 1985,

13:07.427 --> 13:10.795
an emergency call had come
into McMurdo dispatch.

13:13.025 --> 13:16.084
They got a medevac call
and it was from the Davis camp,

13:16.111 --> 13:20.938
which was Australia, on
the far side of east Antarctica.

13:21.033 --> 13:24.533
It was a real emergency
and they had a long flight.

13:24.535 --> 13:27.120
Narrator:
A scientist at Davis camp

13:27.280 --> 13:29.864
was gravely injured
by a boiler explosion

13:29.958 --> 13:32.700
and needed immediate
medical attention.

13:32.702 --> 13:35.861
Including a fuel pit stop
at the South Pole,

13:35.922 --> 13:39.031
Brian's evacuation crew
was six hours away

13:39.092 --> 13:40.978
from the critically injured
patient.

13:41.002 --> 13:45.004
But they had standing orders
to avoid flying over a so-called

13:45.098 --> 13:48.600
"air sampling station" that
was on the most direct route.

13:48.760 --> 13:51.122
So we were
given orders to deviate,

13:51.146 --> 13:53.295
I believe it was 30-mile
deviation away

13:53.357 --> 13:54.947
from the air sampling station.

13:54.949 --> 14:00.569
The... officers on board
suggested that we fly

14:00.571 --> 14:02.714
straight over
the air sampling station

14:02.741 --> 14:04.794
and not deviate and that would
save us 30 minutes.

14:04.818 --> 14:07.410
-It was a no-fly zone.
-Brian: It was a no-fly zone

14:07.570 --> 14:10.872
for that specific region,
um, around the pole.

14:13.051 --> 14:15.388
Narrator: But where the air
sampling station was supposed to be,

14:15.412 --> 14:19.647
the crew faced something
none of them had ever seen.

14:19.674 --> 14:23.376
Brian:
There was this giant indentation

14:23.470 --> 14:25.970
that looked like
a hole in the ice

14:26.131 --> 14:29.307
that looked like a snow ramp
that went down into it.

14:29.467 --> 14:32.385
The polar plateau at South Pole
is completely flat;

14:32.479 --> 14:34.220
there are no holes there.

14:34.314 --> 14:37.148
Now there's this big large hole
in the ice that stood out

14:37.308 --> 14:39.358
like a sore thumb,
it should not have been there.

14:39.360 --> 14:43.963
Narrator: Brian estimated the hole
to be at least 300 feet in diameter.

14:43.990 --> 14:46.265
The size of a football field.

14:46.326 --> 14:48.827
Confounded by
what they had seen,

14:48.987 --> 14:51.454
the crew continued
on their route to Davis.

14:51.614 --> 14:54.582
They picked up
the injured scientist and headed

14:54.584 --> 14:56.901
back to the McMurdo station.

14:56.962 --> 15:00.964
As we were getting back, and
basically taking the same route,

15:01.124 --> 15:04.100
we were called back and told,
"you must deviate from

15:04.102 --> 15:07.512
"your course that you took
from pole to Davis.

15:07.672 --> 15:10.222
You've got to deviate
30 degrees to do this."

15:10.224 --> 15:12.992
We weren't given an explanation,
but we complied

15:13.019 --> 15:15.511
with the request
and on the way back,

15:15.605 --> 15:17.439
the patient died from his burns.

15:19.359 --> 15:21.838
Narrator: When the aircraft
landed at McMurdo station,

15:21.862 --> 15:25.296
the entire crew was escorted to
the senior commander's office.

15:25.323 --> 15:28.825
There, they were ordered
to never speak

15:28.985 --> 15:31.294
of the restricted area
they had flown over.

15:31.296 --> 15:33.872
Immediately after,
I thought to myself,

15:34.032 --> 15:36.232
"well, what was it we weren't
supposed to see?

15:36.367 --> 15:39.102
All we saw was a hole in,
in the ice."

15:39.129 --> 15:42.488
Narrator: If the hole was,
in fact, a natural feature,

15:42.549 --> 15:45.683
why did the crew's flyover

15:45.685 --> 15:48.678
elicit such attention
from high-rank officials?

15:48.838 --> 15:52.648
There's been a lot of talk
about underground bases

15:52.650 --> 15:55.343
in Antarctica and certain
satellite photos

15:55.437 --> 15:59.680
show mountain areas that have
unusual caverns in them,

15:59.774 --> 16:03.751
literal windows that are
the shape of a flying saucer.

16:03.778 --> 16:06.004
Narrator:
Is it possible

16:06.031 --> 16:09.139
that secret,
perhaps extraterrestrial bases,

16:09.201 --> 16:12.601
are hidden beneath
the ice on Antarctica?

16:12.662 --> 16:16.647
Curiously, the idea
of habitable space

16:16.708 --> 16:18.857
beneath the ice has been
recently backed up

16:18.919 --> 16:20.752
by mainstream science.

16:24.633 --> 16:28.284
Mount Erebus. Ross island, Antarctica.

16:28.345 --> 16:30.528
2017.

16:30.555 --> 16:34.190
Researchers from the Australian
national university

16:34.192 --> 16:37.251
discover the existence
of vast ice caverns

16:37.312 --> 16:40.605
directly adjacent
to this active volcano.

16:40.765 --> 16:44.400
Due to their location, these
glacial caves under the ice

16:44.561 --> 16:46.885
offer something
incredibly unique

16:46.947 --> 16:49.480
on the otherwise
frigid continent...

16:49.640 --> 16:52.550
Large heated spaces
with temperatures

16:52.577 --> 16:55.303
warm enough to sustain life.

16:55.330 --> 16:58.581
Michael Salla: Australian
scientists were able to find

16:58.741 --> 17:02.418
enormous caverns
that were hollowed out,

17:02.579 --> 17:05.463
that were places
where you could actually

17:05.623 --> 17:07.839
have life flourish,

17:07.842 --> 17:10.734
that they were able to determine
that some of these caverns

17:10.762 --> 17:14.304
were thermally heated
to a balmy 70, 72 degrees.

17:14.306 --> 17:16.707
Narrator:
72 degrees?

17:16.768 --> 17:18.593
In Antarctica?

17:18.686 --> 17:24.231
Mount Erebus is just one of more
than 90 volcanoes on Antarctica.

17:24.233 --> 17:27.175
Modern technology
has enabled scientists

17:27.237 --> 17:30.062
to discover additional caverns
near these features.

17:30.156 --> 17:32.840
And some are reportedly as large

17:32.867 --> 17:36.627
as the entire island
of Manhattan.

17:36.629 --> 17:39.688
Childress:
Here we have a huge, apparently,

17:39.749 --> 17:43.935
underground world
beneath Antarctica.

17:43.962 --> 17:47.271
And this could be used
by extraterrestrials

17:47.299 --> 17:52.660
as these ready-made bases that
are underground and are hidden.

17:52.821 --> 17:56.589
Narrator: Could these naturally
heated caverns and tunnels

17:56.683 --> 18:00.726
really be inhabited
by extraterrestrials?

18:00.728 --> 18:03.079
The ideas of both passageways

18:03.106 --> 18:05.189
deep under
the Antarctic ice sheets

18:05.350 --> 18:10.336
and also an alien presence on
the icy continent are not new.

18:10.363 --> 18:14.373
Some say they trace back to
the beginning of world war ii

18:14.375 --> 18:17.577
and a secret Nazi expedition.

18:23.493 --> 18:25.354
The Nazis found
some of these caverns germ.

18:25.378 --> 18:28.062
December 1938.

18:28.089 --> 18:30.940
On the brink of world war ii,

18:30.967 --> 18:33.125
Adolf Hitler
is secretly searching

18:33.219 --> 18:35.294
for ancient relics
that he believes

18:35.388 --> 18:37.305
could hold incredible powers.

18:39.776 --> 18:42.869
As part of this effort,
on December 17,

18:42.896 --> 18:45.146
he sends the German freighter MS Schwabenland

18:45.306 --> 18:47.209
on a top secret mission
to establish

18:47.233 --> 18:50.059
a permanent base on Antarctica.

18:50.061 --> 18:55.490
But why is Hitler sacrificing
crucial resources and personnel

18:55.650 --> 18:58.826
for a mission to Antarctica
when he is simultaneously

18:58.986 --> 19:02.430
preparing to go to war?

19:02.457 --> 19:04.018
Salla:
The Thule society

19:04.042 --> 19:06.400
was very important
in understanding,

19:06.461 --> 19:08.052
uh, what happened
in Nazi Germany.

19:08.054 --> 19:12.215
They actually believed
that there were mystics

19:12.375 --> 19:14.335
who could communicate
with beings

19:14.419 --> 19:19.180
who claimed to be
extraterrestrial in origin.

19:19.340 --> 19:23.175
Hitler's Nazi party
got information through

19:23.269 --> 19:26.812
these psychic mediums who
told them that in Antarctica

19:26.814 --> 19:28.774
there is this ancient
civilization

19:28.891 --> 19:30.241
or bases where they could find

19:30.243 --> 19:34.145
advanced technologies.

19:34.305 --> 19:37.690
The Nazis found some of
these caverns beneath the ice.

19:37.784 --> 19:41.226
And some of them can be reached
by submarines, apparently.

19:43.540 --> 19:47.441
Salla: The story goes that the
German Navy were able to find

19:47.502 --> 19:49.836
passages under
the Antarctic ice sheets

19:49.996 --> 19:51.796
to these enormous caverns.

19:53.383 --> 19:56.551
And so, they were then able
to establish these bases

19:56.711 --> 20:00.179
under the Antarctic ice sheet.

20:02.183 --> 20:05.070
Narrator: Does the recent
discovery of interconnected caverns

20:05.094 --> 20:08.137
beneath the ice of Antarctica
validate rumors

20:08.231 --> 20:11.023
about the Nazis that many
mainstream historians

20:11.184 --> 20:13.976
had deemed a complete fantasy?

20:14.070 --> 20:17.188
And if so,
might the Nazis have discovered

20:17.282 --> 20:20.883
something truly incredible
on the frozen continent?

20:22.996 --> 20:25.062
Birnes:
One theory is that

20:25.123 --> 20:28.182
the Germans discovered,

20:28.209 --> 20:30.918
when they were
exploring the South Pole,

20:31.078 --> 20:35.523
that there was actually another
presence at the South Pole

20:35.550 --> 20:37.692
that was not human.

20:37.852 --> 20:41.745
And together with that presence,

20:41.806 --> 20:47.343
the Germans established
a base on Antarctica.

20:47.437 --> 20:50.721
Narrator: After the Nazis
were defeated in 1945,

20:50.815 --> 20:54.292
the United States
and the Soviet Union recruited

20:54.319 --> 20:56.402
the top Nazi scientists,

20:56.562 --> 20:59.405
many who later embarked
on their own secret missions

20:59.565 --> 21:01.482
to Antarctica.

21:01.576 --> 21:04.985
Is it possible that
these two emerging world powers

21:05.079 --> 21:09.140
had knowledge that the Nazis
did, in fact, come into contact

21:09.167 --> 21:13.911
with extraterrestrials
at the South Pole?

21:14.071 --> 21:18.257
August 26, 1946.

21:18.417 --> 21:22.703
A U.S. scientific expedition
called operation highjump

21:22.764 --> 21:25.156
departs for the South Pole.

21:25.183 --> 21:28.392
It is led by esteemed
naval officer and explorer

21:28.553 --> 21:31.044
admiral Richard Byrd.

21:31.105 --> 21:33.956
Birnes:
Admiral Richard Byrd

21:33.983 --> 21:37.275
was a very important admiral
in the United States Navy.

21:37.277 --> 21:41.446
He graduated the United States
Naval Academy at Annapolis,

21:41.448 --> 21:45.017
he fought in World War I,
and after the war,

21:45.078 --> 21:47.077
he became an explorer.

21:47.079 --> 21:51.749
Narrator: In 1926,
Byrd made worldwide headlines

21:51.909 --> 21:55.753
when he and Navy chief aviation
pilot Floyd Bennett,

21:55.913 --> 21:59.982
became the first people
to ever fly over the North Pole.

22:00.009 --> 22:02.576
For their efforts,
both men received

22:02.637 --> 22:05.004
the congressional
medal of honor.

22:05.164 --> 22:08.123
Later, when Byrd,
at the age of 41,

22:08.184 --> 22:11.293
made the first solo flight
over the South Pole,

22:11.354 --> 22:14.205
he became the youngest person
ever promoted to the rank

22:14.232 --> 22:18.234
of admiral in the history
of the United States Navy.

22:18.394 --> 22:23.573
In 1946,
Byrd oversaw operation highjump,

22:23.733 --> 22:27.076
the largest
Antarctic expedition to date.

22:27.236 --> 22:30.979
The massive military convoy
included 13 ships,

22:31.040 --> 22:36.410
33 aircraft and 4,700 troops.

22:36.504 --> 22:40.840
The U.S. Navy sent down
a flotilla of ships

22:41.000 --> 22:43.175
under the command
of admiral Byrd.

22:43.336 --> 22:47.138
And they came back after
about nine months in Antarctica.

22:47.298 --> 22:51.792
Apparently, they actually fought
a battle in Antarctica,

22:51.953 --> 22:54.628
probably between remnants
of the third reich,

22:54.689 --> 22:57.748
and perhaps extraterrestrials,
as well.

22:57.775 --> 23:01.410
There were stories
of craft coming up

23:01.412 --> 23:05.639
out of the water
and attacking them.

23:05.700 --> 23:08.075
Flying saucers dealt
a very heavy defeat

23:08.235 --> 23:10.319
to Byrd's operation highjump.

23:10.413 --> 23:14.907
He gave a report
in march of 1947

23:15.001 --> 23:17.242
that said a new enemy
had been discovered

23:17.337 --> 23:20.087
that could fly from pole to pole
in an instant.

23:22.216 --> 23:24.278
Narrator: Is it possible
that this incredible story

23:24.302 --> 23:27.011
of a naval battle
with extraterrestrials

23:27.171 --> 23:31.081
and encounters with craft
capable of flying from the south

23:31.142 --> 23:35.703
to the North Pole in an instant
could actually be true?

23:39.484 --> 23:42.434
In 2018, more than 70 years

23:42.528 --> 23:45.404
after Byrd's astounding claim,

23:45.564 --> 23:47.931
a satellite image captured
what appeared to be

23:47.992 --> 23:50.859
a condensed water trail
from an aircraft, or contrail,

23:50.954 --> 23:53.804
that could
only have been produced

23:53.831 --> 23:56.958
by something traveling
at incredibly high speeds.

23:59.170 --> 24:02.505
Bradbury: It extended the
entire length of the Earth,

24:02.665 --> 24:05.290
longitudinally, from the
North Pole to the South Pole,

24:05.451 --> 24:08.752
which is 12,000 miles.

24:08.846 --> 24:11.621
Narrator:
The maximum length of time

24:11.783 --> 24:14.909
that a contrail can maintain
its shape is 30 minutes,

24:14.936 --> 24:18.487
but most dissipate
in less than 15.

24:18.489 --> 24:22.057
Only a craft capable
of traveling faster

24:22.151 --> 24:25.969
than 50,000 miles per hour,
or ten times the speed

24:26.030 --> 24:28.672
of the fastest aircraft
in existence today,

24:28.833 --> 24:31.442
could leave a contrail
that would stretch

24:31.536 --> 24:34.537
the entire length of the Earth
without breaking up.

24:36.874 --> 24:41.852
It's a seeming impossibility,
'cause it meant that some object

24:41.879 --> 24:45.197
was able to traverse the entire
planet from pole to pole

24:45.258 --> 24:49.343
in a matter of minutes
before the contrail disappeared.

24:51.597 --> 24:56.166
Bradbury: Whatever created
that was going beyond mach 10.

24:56.227 --> 25:00.095
Mach 10 is over seven,
eight thousand miles per hour.

25:00.189 --> 25:03.899
This was probably going much,
much faster than that.

25:03.901 --> 25:06.301
So whatever it was,
was something that,

25:06.362 --> 25:09.238
more than likely,
we've never seen before.

25:12.910 --> 25:15.494
Narrator:
After sharing the image online,

25:15.654 --> 25:19.289
Michael Bradbury received
replies of confirmed sightings

25:19.291 --> 25:21.600
and even photographic
corroboration

25:21.627 --> 25:23.777
looking up
at what appeared to be

25:23.838 --> 25:26.580
the same incredible contrail
from below.

25:26.582 --> 25:30.367
People had seen from below,

25:30.428 --> 25:34.280
on the ground,
looking up the same thing.

25:34.307 --> 25:38.993
When I saw this, I thought of
admiral Byrd and what he said.

25:39.020 --> 25:44.482
Admiral Byrd did tell us
that we had a very good chance

25:44.642 --> 25:49.153
of being invaded
by a very fast-moving object

25:49.313 --> 25:51.763
that would be able
to travel from pole to pole

25:51.824 --> 25:54.800
at a very incredible speed.

25:54.827 --> 25:59.113
Narrator: Is it possible that
admiral Byrd and the U.S. Navy

25:59.207 --> 26:04.076
really did encounter
alien technology in Antarctica?

26:04.236 --> 26:07.062
Technology that was first
discovered by the Nazis

26:07.090 --> 26:09.423
at the start of world war ii?

26:09.583 --> 26:12.151
And could they even be
developing it

26:12.178 --> 26:15.829
with extraterrestrials
still living there today,

26:15.890 --> 26:18.349
hidden beneath the ice?

26:18.509 --> 26:22.119
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

26:22.146 --> 26:24.146
and suggest further evidence

26:24.306 --> 26:27.857
of a long-standing
alien presence in Antarctica

26:27.859 --> 26:31.070
can be found by investigating
a controversial theory.

26:40.665 --> 26:43.285
Narrator: Istanbul, Turkey.

26:43.309 --> 26:47.678
Locked away in the archives
at the Topkapi Palace Museum

26:47.680 --> 26:49.800
is a piece of gazelle skin
with a fragment

26:49.841 --> 26:53.617
of an intricately drawn
world map on it.

26:53.678 --> 26:56.654
This highly accurate
representation of the globe

26:56.681 --> 27:00.741
is the work of an Ottoman
cartographer, admiral Piri Reis,

27:00.768 --> 27:05.412
and dates back to 1513 AD.

27:05.439 --> 27:09.250
Incredibly,
the map depicts Antarctica,

27:09.277 --> 27:12.385
which was not officially
discovered until 260 years later

27:12.446 --> 27:15.972
by British explorer captain James Cook.

27:16.133 --> 27:18.516
And even more startling,

27:18.578 --> 27:23.855
it depicts the continent as
it would look without any ice.

27:23.916 --> 27:26.041
Tsoukalos:
Piri Reis claimed

27:26.202 --> 27:30.896
that the map that he had
was a finished product

27:30.923 --> 27:34.082
of other maps that he collected,

27:34.243 --> 27:37.336
and all of this information
from the other maps

27:37.430 --> 27:41.398
was transferred into
this one Piri Reis map.

27:41.400 --> 27:43.409
What's so fascinating
about this map

27:43.436 --> 27:48.480
is that it shows Antarctica
without the ice.

27:51.702 --> 27:53.338
The question
that naturally arises:

27:53.362 --> 27:56.338
Well, who made these maps,
if they show

27:56.365 --> 28:00.692
the Antarctic coastline
prior to it being under the ice?

28:00.786 --> 28:05.289
Piri Reis was able to get
access to ancient records.

28:05.449 --> 28:08.441
And we're not clear
exactly where they were,

28:08.502 --> 28:10.302
but possibly the Vatican.

28:10.304 --> 28:13.589
The Vatican library has
extensive ancient records,

28:13.749 --> 28:16.975
and I would imagine that
admiral Piri Reis had access

28:16.977 --> 28:19.695
to some of these maps.

28:19.722 --> 28:24.600
So this supports that Antarctica
was known to the ancient world,

28:24.760 --> 28:26.418
prior to it being

28:26.479 --> 28:30.331
in its present location
under two miles of ice.

28:30.358 --> 28:32.499
Tsoukalos:
It shows

28:32.526 --> 28:35.110
the actual landmass
of Antarctica

28:35.271 --> 28:38.656
exactly as it is under ice.

28:38.816 --> 28:42.976
And so, you have to ask the
question: How was that done?

28:43.037 --> 28:47.314
You have two options: These maps
were gleaned from people

28:47.375 --> 28:50.617
who had access
to radar technology,

28:50.711 --> 28:52.677
and if that is the case,

28:52.679 --> 28:54.880
then one has to argue
it is extraterrestrials,

28:55.040 --> 28:57.066
because who else would have

28:57.093 --> 29:00.094
satellite technology
1,000 or 2,000 years ago?

29:02.481 --> 29:07.917
Another option is what if this
map was drawn during a time

29:07.979 --> 29:10.996
when the Antarctic
was not under ice,

29:11.023 --> 29:14.725
implying that Antarctica
was not at the South Pole

29:14.819 --> 29:17.611
at the time
when that map was drawn.

29:22.201 --> 29:25.977
Narrator: The main proponent of
this theory was Charles Hapgood,

29:26.038 --> 29:28.322
a history professor
at Springfield college

29:28.416 --> 29:30.435
in Massachusetts,
when he first heard

29:30.459 --> 29:33.335
about the paradox
of the Piri Reis map.

29:33.495 --> 29:38.623
In his 1958 book,
<i>the Earth's shifting crust,</i>

29:38.784 --> 29:41.635
Hapgood argued
that Antarctica was ice-free

29:41.795 --> 29:45.306
prior to a catastrophic crustal
displacement that occurred

29:45.466 --> 29:51.586
at the end of the last ice age,
approximately 12,000 years ago.

29:51.647 --> 29:55.107
Hapgood's idea of crustal
displacement was that

29:55.267 --> 29:56.775
in the relatively recent past,

29:56.935 --> 30:00.428
Antarctica was in a much more
temperate zone,

30:00.489 --> 30:03.215
and that it just shifted
and moved very suddenly

30:03.242 --> 30:05.492
into the frozen area.

30:08.530 --> 30:11.098
Narrator:
Mainstream scientists agree

30:11.125 --> 30:13.358
that continents do drift,

30:13.419 --> 30:16.879
and that Antarctica was
once in a warmer latitude.

30:17.039 --> 30:19.356
But they insist
it took millions of years

30:19.383 --> 30:21.150
to reach the South Pole.

30:21.177 --> 30:25.988
Hapgood said it took days,
even hours.

30:26.015 --> 30:27.931
Childress:
Hapgood was saying

30:28.092 --> 30:31.543
that the thin crust
of the Earth is able

30:31.604 --> 30:34.805
to slip forward
on the mantle and this causes

30:34.899 --> 30:37.332
huge cataclysmic changes.

30:37.360 --> 30:40.586
There are tidal waves,
Earthquakes.

30:40.613 --> 30:43.763
And suddenly, landmasses
that aren't at, say,

30:43.824 --> 30:47.451
the North Pole or the South Pole
find themselves there.

30:49.780 --> 30:53.223
Narrator:
If Hapgood's theory is correct,

30:53.250 --> 30:55.210
could an ancient alien
civilization

30:55.252 --> 30:58.178
that once flourished
in a warm Antarctica

30:58.180 --> 31:00.472
have been destroyed
by a catastrophe?

31:00.474 --> 31:04.893
And if so, is evidence
finally coming to light

31:04.895 --> 31:07.638
in the form of
mysterious structures

31:07.798 --> 31:10.891
emerging from the ice?

31:14.939 --> 31:17.105
That civilization
was flash-frozen.

31:17.107 --> 31:19.724
With former Navy flight engineer "Brian,"

31:19.819 --> 31:21.485
investigative journalist

31:21.645 --> 31:24.137
Linda Moulton Howe learned
of a strange incident

31:24.198 --> 31:27.716
that occurred in November 1995,

31:27.743 --> 31:30.427
after he had dropped off
a team of scientists

31:30.454 --> 31:34.990
at a new research site
in Marie Byrd land.

31:35.084 --> 31:39.269
Three, maybe four weeks into
them being out there,

31:39.296 --> 31:41.488
McMurdo lost communication.

31:41.549 --> 31:44.842
They had missed a couple of
their communication windows

31:45.002 --> 31:47.283
that they were supposed
to make a call every day.

31:47.337 --> 31:51.331
Our crew was told to go out
and find out

31:51.392 --> 31:53.483
if everything was okay
at the camp.

31:53.485 --> 31:58.004
So we went out,
and we orbited the camp,

31:58.065 --> 32:00.098
and there was no sign
of anybody.

32:00.258 --> 32:01.483
Right.

32:01.643 --> 32:05.654
So, we landed, and, uh,
our navigator got out,

32:05.814 --> 32:09.624
and he went out to try
and find the, the camp manager.

32:09.626 --> 32:12.636
He comes back and says
there's nobody here.

32:12.663 --> 32:15.563
So we got orders to fly back
to McMurdo,

32:15.724 --> 32:18.417
so we closed up the airplane,
took off, came back to McMurdo.

32:20.421 --> 32:23.922
Narrator: The scientists remained
missing for more than a week...

32:24.082 --> 32:27.575
An impossible amount of time
to survive out in the harsh

32:27.636 --> 32:31.555
Antarctic conditions
without shelter or food.

32:31.715 --> 32:35.500
Yet one week later,
McMurdo dispatch was stunned

32:35.561 --> 32:39.679
when they received radio
communication from the team.

32:39.773 --> 32:44.001
Somehow, they had all returned
to their camp unharmed.

32:44.028 --> 32:49.298
Brian's squadron was once again
given orders to pick them up.

32:49.325 --> 32:52.751
We landed, opened the back end
of the aircraft up,

32:52.753 --> 32:55.987
and the people, they didn't even
grab their gear,

32:56.147 --> 32:58.757
they just ran up to the back
of the airplane and jumped in.

32:58.759 --> 33:01.234
And basically, we had to go out
and get their gear

33:01.295 --> 33:03.089
and put it in the airplane
for them,

33:03.113 --> 33:05.622
because they weren't gonna
get out of the aircraft.

33:05.782 --> 33:09.026
What were you seeing
on their faces

33:09.053 --> 33:12.195
of these scientists
running into the C-130?

33:12.223 --> 33:15.090
They looked scared.
I mean, I can't say it

33:15.092 --> 33:17.384
any plainer than that.
They looked scared.

33:17.478 --> 33:19.602
These people
aren't talking to us,

33:19.604 --> 33:21.212
they're not saying anything.

33:21.273 --> 33:25.350
And I even asked one of the
guys, "hey, where were you guys",

33:25.444 --> 33:27.811
you know, for a whole week?"
And he just looked at me,

33:27.905 --> 33:30.647
and he had this blank stare
on his face,

33:30.741 --> 33:33.891
and he looked right at my face,
and-and didn't say a word.

33:33.953 --> 33:35.244
Not anything.

33:36.872 --> 33:41.958
Would you say, based on your
military life and work,

33:41.960 --> 33:45.412
-were these people in shock?
-Yes.

33:45.506 --> 33:47.898
That's a, that's
a very good explanation,

33:47.925 --> 33:49.324
that they were in shock.

33:49.385 --> 33:50.642
Somebody that had
just experienced

33:50.644 --> 33:55.030
something that terrified them,

33:55.057 --> 33:56.631
from what I can visualize,

33:56.725 --> 33:59.542
the look they had,
yes, they were in shock.

33:59.603 --> 34:02.862
Narrator:
Curiously, as the aircraft

34:02.864 --> 34:04.264
taxied into the runway

34:04.358 --> 34:07.084
at McMurdo station,
they were met

34:07.111 --> 34:08.755
with a special
transport vehicle.

34:08.779 --> 34:11.788
The scientists were
immediately flown

34:11.790 --> 34:16.100
on a private flight back to
Christchurch, New Zealand.

34:16.161 --> 34:20.487
Brian and his team were never
given any explanation

34:20.583 --> 34:22.552
for why the scientists
had gone missing,

34:22.576 --> 34:26.786
or why they were flown out
of Antarctica in such a hurry.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.830
Howe:
What was the scuttlebutt,

34:28.989 --> 34:34.092
where you guys ate,
around this whole operation

34:34.094 --> 34:38.364
of the scientists, the hole,
the silver discs?

34:38.391 --> 34:40.792
What was the scuttlebutt?

34:40.853 --> 34:43.290
In town, people were talking
about maybe they were abducted

34:43.313 --> 34:45.000
by aliens or something
like that.

34:45.024 --> 34:46.898
Kind of started off as a joke.

34:46.900 --> 34:49.568
There were scientists
that were saying that

34:49.728 --> 34:53.487
they had run into some entities
at Marie Byrd land,

34:53.649 --> 34:56.369
-and that's why they went missing.
-Right. Right.

34:56.393 --> 34:59.970
Narrator:
If Brian's accounts are true,

34:59.997 --> 35:03.473
and there is, in fact,
an extraterrestrial presence

35:03.500 --> 35:04.899
in Antarctica today,

35:04.960 --> 35:07.000
could it have been there
for hundreds,

35:07.046 --> 35:09.004
or even thousands of years?

35:09.164 --> 35:14.484
In July 2018,
Linda Moulton Howe interviewed

35:14.511 --> 35:17.179
another whistleblower who
offered to provide her

35:17.339 --> 35:18.913
with classified information

35:18.974 --> 35:21.541
regarding Antarctica
on the condition

35:21.602 --> 35:23.827
that she not reveal
his identity.

35:23.854 --> 35:27.898
Her source, a retired Navy
Seal who she identifies

35:28.058 --> 35:31.109
as "Spartan 1,"
provided her with details

35:31.269 --> 35:34.011
of an ancient structure
he claims to have visited

35:34.073 --> 35:37.265
during his time
at the South Pole.

35:37.326 --> 35:41.678
At that time, my rank was
First Lieutenant Commander,

35:41.705 --> 35:44.088
Naval Special Operations.

35:44.090 --> 35:48.710
We were inbound the southeast
coast of Antarctica.

35:48.870 --> 35:51.880
We were dispatched for,
unofficially,

35:52.040 --> 35:55.225
it was a research/reconnaissance
mission.

35:55.227 --> 35:59.971
Officially, it was to find
a certain individual,

36:00.132 --> 36:02.716
obtain any information,
and bring it back.

36:02.810 --> 36:04.537
Howe:
What was the date?

36:04.561 --> 36:07.111
August 2003.

36:07.113 --> 36:09.797
Narrator:
According to Spartan 1,

36:09.858 --> 36:13.043
when he and his team
reached their destination,

36:13.070 --> 36:15.378
they encountered a large
octagonal structure

36:15.406 --> 36:18.031
protruding from the ice.

36:18.191 --> 36:21.885
Cautiously, they proceeded
to enter it.

36:21.912 --> 36:25.521
Spartan 1: The very top of the
first structure we entered,

36:25.582 --> 36:29.617
there was almost 18 feet
poking from the ice.

36:29.712 --> 36:32.938
The rest of it was hidden
under the ice.

36:32.965 --> 36:34.715
Each door was the same.

36:34.875 --> 36:39.310
Uh, anywhere from 18 feet thick
to around 30 feet thick.

36:39.312 --> 36:43.849
And even though these doors were
that thick and that heavy,

36:44.009 --> 36:46.893
you could take one finger and
push them, and they would open.

36:47.053 --> 36:50.213
There was
no resistance whatsoever.

36:50.374 --> 36:55.101
The outside temperature was
at least 40 degrees below zero.

36:55.195 --> 36:57.048
Once you stepped inside
these structures,

36:57.072 --> 37:01.950
the temperature was an ambient
68 to 72 degrees.

37:07.458 --> 37:09.519
Spartan 1:
It was lighted from the inside,

37:09.543 --> 37:12.285
but we could not find
the source of light.

37:12.379 --> 37:15.313
It was a lime green in color.

37:15.340 --> 37:20.117
The walls were lined with
what I call hieroglyphics.

37:20.179 --> 37:23.847
But nothing of hieroglyphics
that I've ever seen in my life.

37:25.726 --> 37:28.918
Narrator: Could there really
be mysterious structures

37:28.979 --> 37:31.087
buried at the South Pole?

37:31.148 --> 37:35.125
Structures built by an advanced
extraterrestrial civilization

37:35.152 --> 37:37.385
in our remote past?

37:37.446 --> 37:40.572
With all of the recently
reported ufo activity

37:40.732 --> 37:45.093
on the continent, is it possible
that whoever or whatever

37:45.120 --> 37:49.447
was behind the construction
is still around today?

37:49.541 --> 37:52.100
Perhaps further clues
can be found

37:52.127 --> 37:56.797
hidden in plain sight in the Holy Bible.

38:06.266 --> 38:10.351
Narrator:
The Bible's book of Genesis.

38:10.353 --> 38:13.671
In chapter six, verse nine,
begins the story

38:13.732 --> 38:15.506
of Noah and the flood,

38:15.567 --> 38:19.252
in which God sends a great
deluge to rid the Earth

38:19.279 --> 38:21.112
of sinners and start anew.

38:25.427 --> 38:29.353
Different versions
of this same story exist

38:29.414 --> 38:32.249
in nearly every ancient
tradition around the world.

38:35.045 --> 38:37.604
Going back 5,000 years,

38:37.631 --> 38:40.841
we have sacred texts
that tell us there was

38:41.001 --> 38:43.176
an Antediluvian civilization...

38:46.390 --> 38:51.009
...there was a great flood
and that there were survivors.

38:51.169 --> 38:54.070
The Mesopotamians speak of this
in the Epic of Gilgamesh.

38:54.072 --> 38:56.848
The Egyptians speak of this
in the Edfu Creation text.

38:56.942 --> 38:59.359
Plato learned from the Egyptians
that there was once

38:59.519 --> 39:02.270
a civilization called
Atlantis that existed

39:02.364 --> 39:04.680
9,000 years before his time.

39:04.841 --> 39:08.651
Narrator: Plato wrote about
the lost continent of Atlantis

39:08.745 --> 39:11.137
in two of his dialogues,

39:11.164 --> 39:15.725
<i>Timaeus</i> and <i> Critias,</i>
around 360 BC.

39:15.752 --> 39:19.437
Historians and researchers
have long debated whether

39:19.597 --> 39:22.531
this pre-flood civilization
was purely mythological

39:22.593 --> 39:24.742
or actually existed.

39:24.803 --> 39:28.305
Arguments have been made
suggesting remnants

39:28.465 --> 39:30.385
of Plato's
destroyed civilization

39:30.475 --> 39:34.227
could be found
at the South Pole.

39:34.387 --> 39:37.438
Salla: I think what happened
in Antarctica was that

39:37.440 --> 39:40.901
approximately 13,000 years ago,
that flourishing civilization...

39:43.196 --> 39:46.356
...that originally came
from space,

39:46.450 --> 39:51.036
and establishing its presence
in Antarctica, was flash-frozen.

39:52.706 --> 39:54.786
We actually have
ancient evidence of this

39:54.866 --> 39:56.374
in the form of Plato's dialogues

39:56.534 --> 40:00.103
where he talks about
the last days of Atlantis.

40:00.130 --> 40:03.815
That basically is informing us
that Atlantis

40:03.842 --> 40:07.527
was an extraterrestrial colony
that had established itself

40:07.554 --> 40:10.121
on Earth,
and that after a pole shift,

40:10.182 --> 40:13.241
Atlantis was moved under the ice

40:13.268 --> 40:15.410
where the South Pole
currently is.

40:15.437 --> 40:18.388
Narrator:
Scientific anomalies.

40:18.482 --> 40:21.274
Radar and satellite images.

40:21.434 --> 40:24.878
Eyewitness accounts.
As more and more pieces

40:24.905 --> 40:26.945
of the puzzle start
to come together,

40:27.056 --> 40:29.265
might we soon be able
to solve the mystery

40:29.326 --> 40:31.526
of the Antarctic continent?

40:31.686 --> 40:35.330
And if so, just what
might we discover?

40:37.501 --> 40:40.268
Modern whistleblowers still argue

40:40.295 --> 40:43.146
that there is more about Antarctica

40:43.173 --> 40:45.548
that is being covered up than we think.

40:45.709 --> 40:47.992
There are entire bases down there,

40:48.153 --> 40:51.029
entire civilizations,

40:51.056 --> 40:55.383
that the world's governments
are working with aliens.

40:55.477 --> 40:57.330
Salla: They know about
the buried artifacts,

40:57.354 --> 41:00.021
they know about the ancient
civilizations down there.

41:00.181 --> 41:02.774
And they know about the
extraterrestrial civilizations

41:02.934 --> 41:06.844
that continue to operate in
Antarctica at the very moment.

41:06.905 --> 41:10.389
Childress: It's totally possible
that Antarctica contains

41:10.450 --> 41:13.267
extraterrestrial home base on Earth.

41:13.328 --> 41:16.954
It's a totally isolated
part of the planet.

41:16.956 --> 41:20.391
It's completely uninhabited,
or was until recently.

41:20.419 --> 41:23.036
It's ideal.

41:23.130 --> 41:24.691
Henry:
Buried underneath the ice

41:24.715 --> 41:28.374
in Antarctica could well be
stone temple constructions.

41:28.534 --> 41:30.321
There could be biological material,

41:30.345 --> 41:32.281
remains of beings that lived there,

41:32.305 --> 41:33.829
and could still be there.

41:33.890 --> 41:37.666
It could be the greatest reveal
in all of human history.

41:37.828 --> 41:39.747
Narrator:
Are we getting glimpses

41:39.771 --> 41:42.747
of Earth's true history
very deep under the ice sheets

41:42.774 --> 41:44.565
of Antarctica?

41:44.567 --> 41:47.952
And if so, will we soon
be confronted with proof

41:47.954 --> 41:51.013
of an extraterrestrial
presence at the South Pole?

41:52.917 --> 41:56.268
Perhaps when the icy
curtain is finally lifted

41:56.329 --> 41:59.063
and we are ready to learn the truth,

41:59.124 --> 42:02.000
we will find ourselves face-to-face

42:02.160 --> 42:04.644
with our alien ancestors.
