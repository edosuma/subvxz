00:59.102 --> 01:02.062
My mother always
told me that what you stood for

01:02.105 --> 01:04.586
was more important
than the bottom line.

01:04.629 --> 01:07.197
And that's why
at Veritase Cosmetics

01:07.241 --> 01:09.156
everything we make is 100%

01:09.199 --> 01:11.941
certified organic.

01:11.984 --> 01:14.900
It's been almost 15 years
since we started,

01:14.944 --> 01:16.641
and we know
we're not the biggest

01:16.685 --> 01:18.426
or the most expensive,

01:18.469 --> 01:21.168
but that's
not what we set out to be.

01:21.211 --> 01:24.040
We just wanted to be the best.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.172
What do you think?

01:25.215 --> 01:26.956
I think it's perfect.

01:26.999 --> 01:29.698
The Young Women's Business
League is gonna love it.

01:29.741 --> 01:31.110
All right. Great.
I just wanna go through it

01:31.134 --> 01:33.484
- one more time.
- Uh, it's 5:30.

01:33.528 --> 01:35.636
Don't you have that early dinner
with Cameron tonight?

01:35.660 --> 01:37.662
Thank you. Yes.

01:37.706 --> 01:39.708
Okay. Great.

01:39.751 --> 01:41.144
Happy hour.

01:41.188 --> 01:44.365
Hoo.

01:44.408 --> 01:46.343
All right. So where are we at
with the final presentation?

01:46.367 --> 01:48.195
Well, we have our
three finalists,

01:48.238 --> 01:50.153
but they're expensive.

01:50.197 --> 01:53.113
Well, we have to spend money
to make money.

01:53.156 --> 01:54.264
I don't have to tell you
how nervous

01:54.288 --> 01:55.680
that statement makes me.

01:55.724 --> 01:56.768
Oh, come on, Grace.

01:56.812 --> 01:57.876
You've been my CFO long enough

01:57.900 --> 02:00.381
to know that we got this.

02:00.424 --> 02:02.034
Come on. Say it with me.

02:03.427 --> 02:04.994
We got this.

02:05.037 --> 02:06.276
All right.
You keep working on that.

02:06.300 --> 02:07.649
Anything else?

02:07.692 --> 02:09.172
Uh, yeah. Your daughter has some

02:09.216 --> 02:10.695
sort of a surprise for you,

02:10.739 --> 02:12.828
but you didn't hear it from me.

02:12.871 --> 02:15.874
Okay. Great.

02:15.918 --> 02:17.069
I'll see you tomorrow.

02:17.093 --> 02:18.964
Have fun.

02:46.514 --> 02:47.515
Mom.

02:47.558 --> 02:48.646
Cameron.

02:48.690 --> 02:50.213
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:50.257 --> 02:53.390
Oh, I'm so happy
you're home safe.

02:53.434 --> 02:55.000
Yeah, well,
it's good to be back.

02:55.044 --> 02:57.829
So how was Playa?
I wanna hear all about it.

02:57.873 --> 03:01.050
Oh, and what is
the big surprise?

03:01.093 --> 03:03.531
Um,

03:03.574 --> 03:06.403
it's not so much a what,
as a who.

03:06.447 --> 03:08.057
Hi.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.233
Mom, I'd like you to meet
Brent Danner,

03:12.279 --> 03:14.498
my fiance.

03:14.542 --> 03:15.891
I'm engaged.

03:19.242 --> 03:20.765
Mom, say something.

03:20.809 --> 03:23.812
- Uh, I'm just...
- Shocked.

03:23.855 --> 03:25.422
I'm sure.

03:25.466 --> 03:27.729
Yeah.

03:27.772 --> 03:30.210
How did this happen?

03:30.253 --> 03:33.300
Um, uh, why don't we sit down,

03:33.343 --> 03:34.407
and I'll tell you all
about it, hmm?

03:34.431 --> 03:35.476
Okay.

03:38.392 --> 03:40.437
There I was, 7:30 at night,

03:40.481 --> 03:42.439
storm rolling in off the gulf.

03:42.483 --> 03:44.006
It's raining really hard. I'm...

03:44.049 --> 03:45.529
frantically late for dinner.

03:45.573 --> 03:48.010
I look up, and I see this one.

03:49.620 --> 03:51.840
Um, and I was waiting for a taxi

03:51.883 --> 03:53.494
and, of course,
I forgot my umbrella.

03:53.537 --> 03:55.017
Yeah. So I ran up,
I take my coat,

03:55.060 --> 03:57.280
I put it over her head,
and I say...

03:57.324 --> 03:58.649
"You know, they invented
something for this."

03:58.673 --> 03:59.804
Yeah. And she says,

03:59.848 --> 04:02.111
"Yeah, it's called a jacket."

04:02.154 --> 04:03.199
- Bug.
- Bug.

04:07.595 --> 04:09.074
Uh, anyways, then we spent

04:09.118 --> 04:10.530
the rest of the night
exploring the city.

04:10.554 --> 04:11.990
And Brent even
pulled a few strings

04:12.034 --> 04:13.644
and got us
into the state museum.

04:13.688 --> 04:15.820
Yeah. I know a guy
who used to run security there.

04:15.864 --> 04:17.300
Oh.

04:17.344 --> 04:18.910
What line of work
are you in, Brent?

04:18.954 --> 04:20.260
I'm a contractor.

04:20.303 --> 04:22.262
Uh, he's being modest.

04:22.305 --> 04:24.438
He runs a nonprofit
that he cofounded.

04:24.481 --> 04:26.222
They modernize village
infrastructures

04:26.266 --> 04:28.355
in the developing world.

04:28.398 --> 04:31.140
Is that something
that you went to school for?

04:31.183 --> 04:32.924
Well, I mean,
I got my MBA from USC,

04:32.968 --> 04:34.665
but, honestly,
it doesn't really help

04:34.709 --> 04:36.101
when you're up on a roof

04:36.145 --> 04:38.626
laying wire in 100-degree heat.

04:38.669 --> 04:41.716
That's tough, uh, tough job.

04:41.759 --> 04:44.719
Um, something you see yourself
doing long-term?

04:44.762 --> 04:47.199
Uh, call me idealistic but, uh,

04:47.243 --> 04:48.940
I think there's more to life
than money.

04:54.119 --> 04:55.469
She did what?

04:55.512 --> 04:56.774
She got engaged,

04:56.818 --> 04:57.862
ring and everything.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.386
It's insane.

04:59.429 --> 05:01.562
Well, is he hot?

05:01.605 --> 05:05.130
Come on, Grace. It's my
baby girl we're talking about.

05:05.174 --> 05:08.612
I know, but put yourself
in her flip-flops.

05:08.656 --> 05:12.137
I mean, she just got a full ride
to her dream law program,

05:12.181 --> 05:15.445
including her first space
without roommates, and then

05:15.489 --> 05:17.142
she meets some handsome stranger

05:17.186 --> 05:20.276
who sweeps her off her feet
and proposes marriage.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.670
Her future is bright.

05:22.713 --> 05:25.237
Yeah, specially,
after her birthday.

05:25.281 --> 05:27.022
The big 2-5.

05:27.065 --> 05:29.329
That's when her trust fund
kicks in, right?

05:29.372 --> 05:32.070
Yup. $3 million
is a lot of money.

05:32.114 --> 05:34.116
And it's a target.

05:34.159 --> 05:35.944
Okay. I know
that you never really saw

05:35.987 --> 05:38.250
eye-to-eye with your father,
but he knew

05:38.294 --> 05:41.036
what he was doing
when he left her that money.

05:41.079 --> 05:42.385
She's a smart girl

05:42.429 --> 05:45.214
with a good head
on her shoulders.

05:45.257 --> 05:48.173
Grace, she's too young for this.

05:48.217 --> 05:49.392
Okay.

05:49.436 --> 05:51.873
Right. Listen, I'm off to bed.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.440
We've got an early day tomorrow.

05:53.483 --> 05:56.530
You should try
to get some rest too.

05:56.573 --> 05:59.141
Good night.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.026
I mean, I like some
of the design elements,

06:15.070 --> 06:17.507
but I don't think that
this is Veritase.

06:17.551 --> 06:19.511
Okay. All right.
So we'll keep the model.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.602
Oh, hello,
tall, dark, and handsome.

06:25.646 --> 06:27.648
Brent, what are you doing here?

06:27.691 --> 06:29.693
I brought you lunch.

06:29.737 --> 06:32.000
So how did you know
I like sushi?

06:32.043 --> 06:33.915
Cameron said
it was your favorite.

06:33.958 --> 06:35.525
Well, that's very thoughtful.

06:35.569 --> 06:38.310
She also said that you
don't like surprises.

06:38.354 --> 06:40.095
And that is also true.

06:40.138 --> 06:42.402
Look, I'm not sure
if she told you this, but...

06:44.229 --> 06:46.841
both of my parents died

06:46.884 --> 06:48.799
when I was very young.

06:48.843 --> 06:50.453
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:50.497 --> 06:51.648
And I never thought
that I'd have a chance

06:51.672 --> 06:54.631
to be a part of a family again.

06:54.675 --> 06:56.981
I don't wanna mess that up.

06:57.025 --> 06:59.636
Just so you know,

06:59.680 --> 07:02.465
I won't marry your daughter
without your blessing.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.380
- You won't?
- No.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.165
That's why I'm here.

07:07.209 --> 07:08.993
Nicole,

07:09.037 --> 07:12.344
may I have your blessing
to marry Cameron?

07:13.824 --> 07:16.218
Brent, I really
appreciate the effort,

07:16.261 --> 07:19.003
but I just met you last night.

07:19.047 --> 07:21.092
I think it would be
in all of our best interests

07:21.136 --> 07:24.574
if maybe we just slow down
a little bit.

07:24.618 --> 07:27.272
These things take time.

07:27.316 --> 07:30.319
We could revisit
this conversation in six months.

07:32.582 --> 07:34.497
Yeah. You're right.

07:34.541 --> 07:37.195
You know, these things
do take time, and...

07:37.239 --> 07:40.372
I wanna do this the right way.

07:40.416 --> 07:43.201
I'm glad we had this talk.

07:43.245 --> 07:44.657
Well, I should get out
of your hair.

07:44.681 --> 07:46.378
I'm sure you have
a lot of work to do.

07:49.599 --> 07:51.558
Who's Brent Holvik?

07:52.907 --> 07:54.517
What?

07:54.561 --> 07:55.929
I thought your name
was Brent Danner.

07:55.953 --> 07:57.694
Who's Brent Holvik?

08:04.440 --> 08:06.311
I am.

08:06.355 --> 08:11.708
Yes, I was born Brent
Holvik, but...

08:11.752 --> 08:14.494
after my, um, mother passed,

08:16.496 --> 08:18.672
I took her maiden name, Danner,

08:18.715 --> 08:19.890
in her honor.

08:22.371 --> 08:23.981
Oh, that's very sweet.

08:39.256 --> 08:42.870
Sharon, I need you to run
a check on someone for me.

08:44.044 --> 08:45.133
You what?

08:45.176 --> 08:47.004
I ran a credit check on him.

08:47.048 --> 08:49.920
Do you have any idea
what a breach of trust that is?

08:49.964 --> 08:53.010
I followed my intuition
and it paid off.

08:53.054 --> 08:55.883
There's a lot about Brent's
past that he's not telling you.

08:55.926 --> 08:57.928
What are you talking about?

08:57.972 --> 09:00.278
Well, he changed
his name five years ago

09:00.322 --> 09:03.325
after he filed for bankruptcy.

09:03.368 --> 09:04.935
And before that,
there's a huge hole

09:04.979 --> 09:06.546
in his record, all right?

09:06.589 --> 09:09.461
No credit history,
no bank accounts, nothing.

09:09.505 --> 09:11.594
It's like he stopped existing.

09:11.638 --> 09:13.596
He's bankrupt
because his business partner

09:13.640 --> 09:16.730
embezzled everything and ran
their startup into the ground.

09:16.773 --> 09:18.427
Oh, and that huge hole,

09:18.470 --> 09:20.100
he was in South America
doing deep research

09:20.124 --> 09:21.691
on rural villages.

09:21.735 --> 09:24.433
So, yeah, he sounds
like a real bad guy.

09:24.476 --> 09:25.889
I don't know
what kind of guy he is

09:25.913 --> 09:28.655
because I met him 24 hours ago.

09:28.698 --> 09:30.918
And he comes waltzing
into your life

09:30.961 --> 09:34.225
a month before you inherit
$3 million.

09:34.269 --> 09:36.924
So forgive me if
I'm a little suspicious,

09:36.967 --> 09:39.013
okay? Uh, I'm just...
I'm trying to protect you.

09:39.056 --> 09:41.972
Well, this is
the wrong way to do that.

09:42.016 --> 09:44.105
I just wanna be
a part of your life.

09:44.148 --> 09:46.934
Yeah, well, you're about
15 years too late for that.

09:46.977 --> 09:49.850
You know, that's not fair.

09:49.893 --> 09:52.548
After your father died,
I started Veritase

09:52.592 --> 09:55.246
because I need it to support us.

09:55.290 --> 09:58.119
But I'm here now, okay?

09:58.162 --> 10:00.687
And I... I just wanna help.

10:00.730 --> 10:02.297
I understand that. I do.

10:02.340 --> 10:06.867
But this, this is not helping.

10:06.910 --> 10:08.216
Where are you going?

10:08.259 --> 10:11.959
To plan my wedding, alone.

10:13.743 --> 10:15.223
I can't believe you.

10:41.945 --> 10:44.208
I missed you.

10:44.252 --> 10:45.532
You're not supposed to be here.

10:57.787 --> 11:01.486
And you're supposed
to be engaged, but...

11:01.530 --> 11:05.012
what your little fiancee
doesn't know won't hurt her,

11:05.055 --> 11:06.970
at least, not yet.

11:07.014 --> 11:09.669
She's still innocent,

11:09.712 --> 11:12.323
and that's how
she needs to stay,

11:12.367 --> 11:14.151
until she turns 25.

11:14.195 --> 11:15.718
And becomes my wife.

11:15.762 --> 11:16.763
And then she dies.

11:17.894 --> 11:19.635
And, legally,

11:19.679 --> 11:23.291
all that money goes to her
poor grieving husband.

11:25.032 --> 11:28.470
You don't know
how I've missed you.

11:28.513 --> 11:29.906
She's home. You got to go.

11:29.950 --> 11:31.734
I'll come to you.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.214
Tomorrow night.

11:33.257 --> 11:34.737
Don't forget.

11:42.049 --> 11:44.312
Hey, what's wrong?

11:47.968 --> 11:50.274
It's my mom.

11:50.318 --> 11:51.928
She ran a credit check on you.

11:51.972 --> 11:53.364
What?

11:53.408 --> 11:55.279
Uh, why...
Why would she do that?

11:55.323 --> 11:57.064
Because she's a paranoid.

11:57.107 --> 11:58.935
She even revealed you
being bankrupt

11:58.979 --> 12:00.328
like it's a lie or something.

12:00.371 --> 12:02.417
Uh, but we talked about that.

12:02.460 --> 12:05.246
I know. I know.

12:05.289 --> 12:06.638
Uh, I'm sorry.

12:06.682 --> 12:08.510
She's always been like this.

12:08.553 --> 12:10.227
She's never there for me
when I needed her,

12:10.251 --> 12:11.619
but as soon as
I brought someone home,

12:11.643 --> 12:14.559
she finds something
wrong with them.

12:14.603 --> 12:16.189
And I know she's just
trying to protect me,

12:16.213 --> 12:18.563
but between that and trying
to plan a wedding, I...

12:18.607 --> 12:20.217
Uh, it's overwhelming,
all right?

12:20.261 --> 12:21.436
Yeah.

12:21.479 --> 12:23.351
Hey, hey, hey,

12:23.394 --> 12:26.354
I know you are going through
rough time right now, but...

12:26.397 --> 12:28.660
you're gonna get through this.

12:28.704 --> 12:30.575
I love you.

12:30.619 --> 12:32.969
That's all that matters, right?

12:33.013 --> 12:35.624
I love you too.

12:35.667 --> 12:37.887
Why don't... why don't you
call her tomorrow.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.169
I'm sure she'll think
differently about it

12:39.193 --> 12:41.978
when she sleeps on it.

12:42.022 --> 12:44.764
Okay. All right. I will.

12:48.245 --> 12:50.552
Okay.

12:50.595 --> 12:53.424
Um, I'm gonna go upstairs, okay?

12:58.560 --> 12:59.648
Cameron.

12:59.691 --> 13:01.171
Hey, mom.

13:01.215 --> 13:03.478
Listen, I said
some things yesterday

13:03.521 --> 13:05.219
that I probably shouldn't have.

13:05.262 --> 13:07.090
But I just think

13:07.134 --> 13:08.154
if you could spend some time

13:08.178 --> 13:09.527
getting to know Brent,

13:09.571 --> 13:13.096
you could see
why I love him so much.

13:13.140 --> 13:15.838
Okay. We'll give him
a second chance, of course.

13:15.882 --> 13:18.536
For you, honey, all right?

13:18.580 --> 13:21.844
How about dinner tonight
at the house around 7:00?

13:21.888 --> 13:24.325
Actually, that works.

13:24.368 --> 13:25.674
Okay. Great. Thank you, Mommy.

13:25.717 --> 13:27.545
Thank you so much.

13:27.589 --> 13:29.199
Hey, we'll bring the wine.

13:29.243 --> 13:31.636
All right.
I'm looking forward to it.

13:37.251 --> 13:39.296
So you'd already
drawn up all the plans.

13:39.340 --> 13:42.952
You had everything measured
down to the last square foot.

13:42.996 --> 13:44.736
So? What's wrong with that?

13:44.780 --> 13:46.129
I was a very thorough kid.

13:46.173 --> 13:47.261
It was a tree house.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.612
I'd love to see that.

13:50.655 --> 13:52.222
Be careful what you wish for.

13:52.266 --> 13:55.225
So, Brent, how are things
at the nonprofit?

13:55.269 --> 13:56.879
We're busy.
Um, I've been meeting

13:56.923 --> 13:58.533
with a friend of mine
from Guatemala.

13:58.576 --> 13:59.751
A friend?

13:59.795 --> 14:01.144
You mean, the deputy...

14:01.188 --> 14:03.059
of the Guatemalan
State Department.

14:03.103 --> 14:04.626
My buddy, Rigo.

14:04.669 --> 14:05.777
We've been trying
to work together

14:05.801 --> 14:07.455
on something for a while now.

14:07.498 --> 14:09.152
There's a lot
of need down there.

14:09.196 --> 14:11.807
But it's difficult
navigating the bureaucracy.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.591
And that's where Rigo comes in.

14:13.635 --> 14:15.419
We're pushing
the permits through.

14:15.463 --> 14:17.595
We're breaking ground
this November.

14:17.639 --> 14:20.163
What? Won't you be in
the middle of your program then?

14:20.207 --> 14:22.644
I will, but Brent
can travel back and forth.

14:22.687 --> 14:24.559
He doesn't have
to be down there full time.

14:24.602 --> 14:26.561
Oh.

14:26.604 --> 14:28.215
Mom, we'll figure it out.

14:30.478 --> 14:32.219
Rest room?

14:32.262 --> 14:34.395
Uh, yeah,
next to the front door.

14:34.438 --> 14:35.875
Excuse me.

14:44.013 --> 14:46.059
Will you stop
being so judgmental?

14:52.413 --> 14:55.155
What are you doing in here?

14:55.198 --> 14:58.071
I was looking for a pen.

14:58.114 --> 15:00.943
This is a private office.
You can't be in here.

15:00.987 --> 15:02.466
Oh, I'm so sorry.

15:02.510 --> 15:03.946
I... I didn't mean to intrude.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.948
What's going on here?

15:05.992 --> 15:07.558
Mom?

15:07.602 --> 15:10.866
I don't know, Cameron.
Why don't you ask Brent?

15:10.910 --> 15:13.956
Like I said,
I was looking for a pen.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.219
I wanted to give you
a thank-you card.

15:19.875 --> 15:22.399
I wanted you to have these.

15:22.443 --> 15:24.575
They were my mother's.

15:24.619 --> 15:26.838
That is so sweet.

15:26.882 --> 15:29.711
I'm sorry, Brent.

15:29.754 --> 15:32.279
I wanted to give you
a second chance but I can't.

15:32.322 --> 15:33.802
What's this supposed to mean,

15:33.845 --> 15:35.543
that I'm replacing
your dead mother?

15:35.586 --> 15:36.979
- Mom.
- I can't play along

15:37.023 --> 15:38.067
like this, Cameron.

15:38.111 --> 15:39.460
Mother, stop.

15:39.503 --> 15:41.505
Number one, you're too young.

15:41.549 --> 15:43.855
I can't believe
you are doing this right now.

15:43.899 --> 15:44.987
What am I supposed to do?

15:45.031 --> 15:47.163
- I don't...
- Nicole,

15:47.207 --> 15:51.080
I love your daughter very much,
and I wanna marry her.

15:51.124 --> 15:52.603
But I also respect
your relationship,

15:52.647 --> 15:56.085
and I don't want to get
in the middle of it.

15:56.129 --> 15:58.392
I think it's best
if I just left.

15:58.435 --> 16:00.960
No. Brent, wait.
Wait. Brent, please.

16:06.443 --> 16:11.971
He tried to give you a gift
and you turned it around on him?

16:12.014 --> 16:14.016
What is the matter with you?

16:14.060 --> 16:15.800
Brent, wait. Let me explain.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.783
She's treating
you like you're some

16:25.810 --> 16:27.788
gold digger who's waiting
for me to inherit the money

16:27.812 --> 16:29.423
before skipping out on me.

16:29.466 --> 16:30.487
Well, you know money
is the last thing

16:30.511 --> 16:32.121
that's important to me.

16:32.165 --> 16:34.045
I mean, if it's that's much
of a problem then...

16:34.080 --> 16:35.820
we could wait.

16:35.864 --> 16:37.344
We'll be waiting a long time

16:37.387 --> 16:38.867
for the world's
most paranoid mom

16:38.910 --> 16:39.955
to come to her senses.

16:42.914 --> 16:45.482
Who keeps texting you?

16:45.526 --> 16:49.138
It's Rigo. He's working late
trying to finalize the contract.

16:49.182 --> 16:50.879
She's never
gonna change her mind.

16:50.922 --> 16:52.030
She's probably not even
gonna come to the wedding.

16:52.054 --> 16:53.708
I know her.

16:53.751 --> 16:56.406
There's gonna be
some emergency at Veritase.

16:56.450 --> 16:57.755
You know, I don't know why

16:57.799 --> 16:59.235
I'm trying to pull
this together.

17:01.672 --> 17:03.196
Well...

17:03.239 --> 17:06.068
why do we even need
a big wedding anyway?

17:06.112 --> 17:07.590
What do you mean?

17:07.635 --> 17:10.246
We could just... elope.

17:13.249 --> 17:14.598
- Really?
- Yeah. I mean,

17:14.642 --> 17:16.228
you got this place
for a couple more months

17:16.252 --> 17:18.166
till school finishes.

17:18.211 --> 17:19.864
So we've got a roof
over our heads.

17:19.907 --> 17:21.561
We're in love.

17:21.605 --> 17:23.346
What more do we need?

17:23.390 --> 17:25.020
We could hop on a flight
tomorrow to Vegas.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.436
Uh-uh, no. Let's do it tonight.

17:27.481 --> 17:29.241
Well, I was just thinking
with the weekend coming,

17:29.265 --> 17:30.223
- I mean, we could...
- No, babe,

17:30.266 --> 17:31.441
I don't wanna wait.

17:31.485 --> 17:32.964
I'm ready.

17:33.008 --> 17:34.314
Let's do it now.

17:36.533 --> 17:38.100
Yeah.

17:38.144 --> 17:41.103
Let's do it.

17:47.718 --> 17:49.305
Hey, it's Brent, can't get
to the phone right now.

17:49.329 --> 17:51.505
Leave me a message.

17:51.548 --> 17:54.290
Aaah!

18:02.951 --> 18:07.651
Is this more of an "I
need a hug" moment?

18:07.695 --> 18:09.827
What?

18:09.871 --> 18:11.786
You didn't know?

18:13.875 --> 18:15.442
She eloped?

18:15.485 --> 18:17.879
Maybe she was
trying to save money.

18:17.922 --> 18:19.402
No.

18:19.446 --> 18:21.883
She did this
because I told her not to.

18:24.799 --> 18:26.017
Sharon, can you please cancel

18:26.061 --> 18:27.584
the rest of my meetings
for today?

18:27.628 --> 18:30.370
No. You don't wanna do that.

18:30.413 --> 18:32.285
Hold off.

18:34.156 --> 18:36.027
Why not?

18:36.071 --> 18:37.986
Because she's already
made her choice.

18:38.029 --> 18:41.032
The more you attack that,
the harder she clings to him.

18:47.213 --> 18:49.650
Okay. So what am I
supposed to do?

18:49.693 --> 18:53.262
Oh, what would you
want your mother to do

18:53.306 --> 18:57.397
if you ran off and married
some handsome stranger?

19:04.273 --> 19:07.537
- Here we go.
- Okay. Put me down.

19:07.581 --> 19:11.193
Water?

19:11.237 --> 19:13.282
- Yes. I am done.
- Me too.

19:36.218 --> 19:37.524
Water, my wife.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.787
Thank you, my husband.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.571
I'm gonna hop in the shower.

19:41.615 --> 19:42.964
Okay.

19:43.007 --> 19:44.327
Hmm, you want me
to order a pizza?

19:44.357 --> 19:46.141
- Sounds great.
- Okay.

19:52.887 --> 19:54.256
You're not expecting anyone,
are you?

19:54.280 --> 19:55.672
Uh, no.

20:01.852 --> 20:03.114
Can I come in?

20:04.246 --> 20:05.246
Sure.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.867
Cameron, when your dad died,

20:16.911 --> 20:19.870
I should have been there
for you.

20:19.914 --> 20:21.959
And instead of dealing
with the pain,

20:22.003 --> 20:24.919
I focused on the business.

20:24.962 --> 20:27.835
I don't know. I thought
it would help me forget.

20:27.878 --> 20:30.533
And that wasn't fair to you.

20:30.577 --> 20:33.928
And I don't wanna lose
any more time with you.

20:35.973 --> 20:39.673
I was thinking...
for your 25th birthday,

20:39.716 --> 20:42.415
I'd love to throw you
a huge party.

20:42.458 --> 20:44.504
And you could see it as,
I don't know,

20:44.547 --> 20:46.070
a belated wedding reception too.

20:48.464 --> 20:51.337
I just wanna celebrate you.

20:51.380 --> 20:52.947
I wanna celebrate both of you.

20:55.254 --> 21:00.084
Brent, I owe you an apology
for the way I treated you.

21:00.128 --> 21:03.392
Do you think maybe
we could start over?

21:03.436 --> 21:05.264
I would love that.

21:05.307 --> 21:06.352
Great.

21:20.844 --> 21:22.779
Hey, sweetie, I think
I'm gonna go take a bubble bath.

21:22.803 --> 21:24.805
Um, listen, Rigo just texted me.

21:24.848 --> 21:26.391
He's got a layover
and he wants me to meet him

21:26.415 --> 21:27.938
for some drinks at the airport.

21:27.982 --> 21:29.723
It might go a little late.

21:29.766 --> 21:31.115
You don't mind, do you?

21:31.159 --> 21:33.422
No, of course not.

21:33.466 --> 21:35.206
Thanks, babe.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.251
Have fun.

22:03.191 --> 22:06.020
How could you?

22:06.063 --> 22:08.239
You went and married her.

22:08.283 --> 22:09.371
That was the plan.

22:09.415 --> 22:12.374
Not on that night.

22:12.418 --> 22:14.463
That was our anniversary.

22:14.507 --> 22:15.551
You promised me.

22:15.595 --> 22:17.553
All right. Calm down.

22:17.597 --> 22:19.381
Don't tell me to calm down.

22:19.425 --> 22:22.341
Do you understand
what I've sacrificed for this?

22:22.384 --> 22:26.127
How much I've put on the line
to get us this far?

22:26.170 --> 22:30.392
My future, my career,
our life together.

22:30.436 --> 22:32.916
And you go off and do some
last-minute improvising?!

22:32.960 --> 22:36.746
- No. It was her idea.
- Oh.

22:36.790 --> 22:39.706
So she's calling the shots now.

22:39.749 --> 22:43.187
Don't forget,
I picked this girl out

22:43.231 --> 22:46.408
after her grandfather
drafted that trust.

22:46.452 --> 22:49.150
I read through her
pathetic social media posts

22:49.193 --> 22:51.718
and waded through
her idiotic Instagram

22:51.761 --> 22:55.678
to make sure that you were
everything she wanted.

22:55.722 --> 22:58.464
All you have to do
is play that part.

22:58.507 --> 22:59.876
- And that's what I'm doing.
- Is that

22:59.900 --> 23:02.163
what you were doing in Vegas?

23:02.206 --> 23:04.470
I did what I had to do, okay?
I'm sorry.

23:04.513 --> 23:06.863
Don't tell me you're sorry.

23:10.171 --> 23:13.696
Stick to the plan, our plan.

23:13.740 --> 23:14.784
Okay.

23:17.874 --> 23:20.355
Okay. So here's the invoice

23:20.399 --> 23:23.010
for the website renovations.

23:23.053 --> 23:24.664
Yeah, that looks great.

23:24.707 --> 23:27.362
Oh, okay. So now on to something

23:27.406 --> 23:29.451
that you're actually
going to care about,

23:29.495 --> 23:32.672
reviewing the menu
for Cameron's wedding reception.

23:32.715 --> 23:34.587
So there's gluten-free

23:34.630 --> 23:37.720
and vegetarian options
for people like you,

23:37.764 --> 23:40.331
and then
there's some normal food

23:40.375 --> 23:42.029
for people like me.

23:42.072 --> 23:44.814
I love the idea of cupcakes.

23:44.858 --> 23:47.164
Great. Just make sure
nothing has any nuts.

23:47.208 --> 23:49.428
I already went over
Cameron's allergy with them.

23:49.471 --> 23:51.168
They deal with this
all the time.

23:51.212 --> 23:52.300
They're very careful.

23:52.343 --> 23:53.475
No nuts.

23:53.519 --> 23:55.042
Okay. Perfect.

23:55.085 --> 23:56.435
They're gonna love it.

23:56.478 --> 23:58.132
Yeah, I hope so.

23:58.175 --> 24:00.787
I have a lot of lost time
to make up for.

24:00.830 --> 24:01.894
Well, you know what,
you've been putting in

24:01.918 --> 24:04.138
a lot of extra hours lately.

24:04.181 --> 24:06.053
So when I make
that cupcake order,

24:06.096 --> 24:09.491
I'm gonna have them throw
in a couple of extra for you.

24:09.535 --> 24:10.536
Okay.

24:41.610 --> 24:42.655
Here you go.

24:42.698 --> 24:44.221
It's perfect.

24:44.265 --> 24:45.895
Would you like to add
a personalized card?

24:45.919 --> 24:49.313
Yeah. Um, "Dearest Lexi",

24:49.357 --> 24:51.141
a taste of things to come.

24:51.185 --> 24:53.492
"Love, Brent."

24:53.535 --> 24:54.667
Excellent.

24:57.757 --> 24:59.454
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

25:04.154 --> 25:05.808
Brent?

25:05.852 --> 25:09.203
Nicole. What a surprise.
What are you doing here?

25:09.246 --> 25:11.031
Just running some errands.
How about you?

25:11.074 --> 25:13.512
Oh, anniversary present, uh,

25:13.555 --> 25:15.557
I mean,
it came about a month ago.

25:15.601 --> 25:17.298
Oh, that's really sweet.

25:17.341 --> 25:18.647
Can I see?

25:21.302 --> 25:23.391
I heard you had
a big meeting last night.

25:23.434 --> 25:24.827
Oh, yeah. Rigo had a layover,

25:24.871 --> 25:26.326
so I met him for some drinks
at the airport.

25:26.350 --> 25:27.613
Oh, what bar?

25:27.656 --> 25:28.764
I have meetings
there all the time?

25:28.788 --> 25:30.485
Oh, I'm sorry. Late night.

25:30.529 --> 25:31.747
Uh, his flight got delayed,

25:31.791 --> 25:33.532
so I met him at a bar downtown.

25:33.575 --> 25:36.099
Oh.

25:36.143 --> 25:38.449
Oh, Brent, this is gorgeous.

25:38.493 --> 25:39.712
She's gonna love this.

25:39.755 --> 25:41.670
I thought so too.

25:41.714 --> 25:44.151
Unfortunately,
I have to get to a meeting.

25:44.194 --> 25:45.979
The world
can't save itself, right?

25:46.022 --> 25:47.850
But, uh, it's great to see you.

25:47.894 --> 25:49.243
You too.

25:50.636 --> 25:51.637
Take care.

26:46.256 --> 26:47.606
Having a good time?

26:47.649 --> 26:49.172
What the hell
are you doing here?

26:49.216 --> 26:50.410
I wanted to make sure
you're performing

26:50.434 --> 26:52.480
your duties as a good husband.

26:52.523 --> 26:54.414
Uh, you can't be here.
Hey, what if she wakes up?

26:54.438 --> 26:55.570
What if she what?

26:55.614 --> 26:59.792
Oh...
what if your wife wakes up,

26:59.835 --> 27:02.316
finds out her Prince Charming
has been lying to her face.

27:02.359 --> 27:04.144
- Shh.
- This whole time?

27:04.187 --> 27:05.643
You are gonna mess
this whole thing up.

27:05.667 --> 27:08.844
No. You're going to mess it up.

27:08.888 --> 27:11.455
That girl is in your head.

27:11.499 --> 27:13.196
No. That's ridiculous.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.459
You don't know
what you're talking about.

27:15.503 --> 27:18.027
You don't think I know
how she touches you?

27:20.377 --> 27:23.380
,

27:23.424 --> 27:26.601
You keep playing your role,

27:26.645 --> 27:29.909
at least, until the reception
this weekend,

27:29.952 --> 27:33.303
when your wife is going to have
a terrible accident.

27:33.347 --> 27:34.827
No, no, not at the reception.

27:34.870 --> 27:37.264
There'll be
too many people there.

27:37.307 --> 27:39.875
It'll be perfect.

27:39.919 --> 27:42.530
It'll happen in plain sight.

27:42.573 --> 27:45.141
Everyone will see you
doing everything you could

27:45.185 --> 27:49.624
to save her, but, of course,
that's not going to be possible

27:49.668 --> 27:51.365
without this.

27:53.019 --> 27:54.585
There's probably...

27:54.629 --> 27:58.111
a backup EpiPen
at the mother's house.

27:58.154 --> 28:01.723
Make sure that one's
misplaced too.

28:01.767 --> 28:05.074
When it's all over,
the blame falls on the caterer,

28:05.118 --> 28:07.163
and we'll live
happily ever after.

28:17.739 --> 28:20.568
Do you love her?

28:20.611 --> 28:21.893
Babe. What are you doing?

28:21.917 --> 28:24.050
All right, get out of here, go.

28:26.661 --> 28:28.750
Uh, I was getting some water.

28:28.794 --> 28:30.926
Sound like you were
talking to somebody.

28:30.970 --> 28:32.885
No.

28:32.928 --> 28:34.277
Are you sure?

28:34.321 --> 28:36.149
'Cause I heard you whispering.

28:36.192 --> 28:38.412
Oh, trying to get this open,
I was probably.

28:38.455 --> 28:39.781
- Oh.
- Talking to myself.

28:39.805 --> 28:40.980
Oh.

28:41.023 --> 28:42.982
Okay.

28:43.025 --> 28:44.505
Well, you wanna get back to bed?

28:44.548 --> 28:48.161
- Yes.
- Let's go.

29:02.610 --> 29:04.133
All right. Yeah.

29:04.177 --> 29:06.092
No, no, I'll hold.

29:06.135 --> 29:07.833
I'm on hold.
Waiting for confirmation

29:07.876 --> 29:08.964
of the wire transfer.

29:12.141 --> 29:14.753
Are you nervous?

29:14.796 --> 29:15.971
I don't know.

29:16.015 --> 29:17.581
You should be.

29:17.625 --> 29:20.410
$3 million is a lot of money.
Yeah.

29:20.454 --> 29:23.457
Have you thought about what
you're gonna do with it yet?

29:23.500 --> 29:26.199
Well actually, um,
I've been talking with Brent

29:26.242 --> 29:29.768
about maybe using some of it
to build a house.

29:29.811 --> 29:31.117
There's that spot that I like,

29:31.160 --> 29:32.118
and I talked
to the real estate agent

29:32.161 --> 29:33.728
the other day

29:33.772 --> 29:37.166
and he said
it's still available.

29:37.210 --> 29:39.647
I know. I know, you want me
to think about it

29:39.690 --> 29:41.605
for a while
before I do anything crazy.

29:41.649 --> 29:43.564
No. It's not that, it's...

29:43.607 --> 29:47.263
And I have been thinking
about it for a long time.

29:47.307 --> 29:50.658
I've just been waiting for it
to feel right.

29:50.701 --> 29:52.529
You know, I'm with Brent and...

29:52.573 --> 29:55.097
It feels right.

29:55.141 --> 29:58.231
Yeah.

29:58.274 --> 30:00.015
I know you're still getting
to know him,

30:00.059 --> 30:03.845
but, Mommy, he makes me happy.

30:03.889 --> 30:06.674
Well, if he makes you happy,
honey, I'm happy.

30:06.717 --> 30:08.632
It's all that matters to me.

30:08.676 --> 30:10.634
All right.

30:10.678 --> 30:13.202
Very good. Okay.

30:13.246 --> 30:15.465
All right.
We're all set at the bank.

30:15.509 --> 30:17.859
We're almost finished.
I just need your signature

30:17.903 --> 30:20.557
on a few more documents and...

30:20.601 --> 30:22.690
Um, Alexa, do you have
those forms?

30:29.392 --> 30:31.481
Of course, Mr. Rader.

30:31.525 --> 30:32.569
Thank you.

30:38.184 --> 30:39.663
Okay.

30:42.057 --> 30:43.754
Sign here.

30:54.765 --> 30:56.332
Congratulations.

30:56.376 --> 30:58.857
You are officially
a multi-millionaire.

31:00.336 --> 31:03.731
Oh, my God.

31:03.774 --> 31:05.733
Well, I guess we know
who's buying dinner.

31:05.776 --> 31:06.777
Deal.

31:09.084 --> 31:11.391
Well.

31:11.434 --> 31:14.220
Would you look
what the cat dragged in.

31:15.395 --> 31:17.005
Come to apologize?

31:19.181 --> 31:22.837
I came here to bargain.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.926
You've had your fun,
but for this to work,

31:24.970 --> 31:26.754
it has to stop now.

31:26.797 --> 31:29.626
All of this has to stop.

31:29.670 --> 31:32.455
This doesn't stop
until it's over.

31:32.499 --> 31:33.587
Well, trust me.

31:33.630 --> 31:35.067
It'll be over a lot quicker

31:35.110 --> 31:36.677
if you give me
some breathing room.

31:36.720 --> 31:39.941
Let me do what I have to do.

31:39.985 --> 31:41.464
What's in the box?

31:47.862 --> 31:49.385
I got you this to make up for us

31:49.429 --> 31:51.257
not being together
on our anniversary.

31:53.912 --> 31:56.044
I believe in us.

31:56.088 --> 31:59.787
Now I need you to believe in me.

31:59.830 --> 32:02.572
Let me do this.

32:04.531 --> 32:06.576
All right.

32:21.722 --> 32:27.858
Unrefined nut protein oil.
One drop and it's all over.

32:33.952 --> 32:34.952
Brent.

32:37.303 --> 32:39.653
Don't fail me.

32:58.411 --> 33:00.500
Are you sure I have to wear
a tie to this thing?

33:00.543 --> 33:02.806
Yes. I want you looking dapper.

33:02.850 --> 33:04.504
Good luck with that.

33:04.547 --> 33:06.027
Well, we never had
a proper wedding

33:06.071 --> 33:08.595
for all of our friends
to see us dressed up.

33:08.638 --> 33:10.518
I just wanna show everyone
how handsome you are.

33:19.084 --> 33:21.521
All right. Let's see
if I can fix this tie.

33:23.305 --> 33:25.394
So, how does it feel
to be married

33:25.438 --> 33:26.961
to a bona fide millionaire?

33:27.005 --> 33:30.617
Look, I want you to know
that this money

33:30.660 --> 33:33.141
is never gonna mess
anything up between us.

33:33.185 --> 33:35.665
I wanted you
before you were rich

33:35.709 --> 33:38.886
and nothing's ever
gonna change that.

33:38.929 --> 33:41.758
I love you, Cam.

33:41.802 --> 33:44.370
I love you, too.

33:52.247 --> 33:53.398
You don't know what
you're doing with this, are you?

33:53.422 --> 33:54.597
No, I really don't.

33:54.641 --> 33:56.295
Get out of here.

33:56.338 --> 33:57.774
- You're a bug.
- Yeah.

34:06.870 --> 34:10.091
Babe, have you seen my phone?

34:10.135 --> 34:13.703
Uh, yeah. It's right here.

34:13.746 --> 34:15.531
Ah, doy.

34:15.574 --> 34:17.292
You know, I swear all the money
in the world,

34:17.315 --> 34:18.708
you can't buy a better memory.

34:18.752 --> 34:20.121
Oh, hey, let me help you
with your collar.

34:20.145 --> 34:21.146
Please, yeah.

34:21.188 --> 34:23.235
'Cause we got to go.

34:27.630 --> 34:30.371
All right, all right.
Yup. Center. Awesome. Okay.

34:30.416 --> 34:32.437
Now, let's go before we're late
to our own wedding reception.

34:32.460 --> 34:33.766
Okay. I'll be right down.

34:33.810 --> 34:36.596
Okay.

34:54.918 --> 34:55.918
I love you, Cam.

34:55.963 --> 35:03.963
I love you, Cam.

35:04.406 --> 35:05.581
I love y...

35:08.280 --> 35:11.979
Oh, sweetheart,
you look so pretty.

35:12.022 --> 35:14.242
And you, Brent,
you are so handsome.

35:14.286 --> 35:15.939
Oh.

35:15.983 --> 35:19.813
You even wore a tie.
I love a man in a tie.

35:19.856 --> 35:20.920
See, what did I tell you
about the tie?

35:20.944 --> 35:23.904
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:23.947 --> 35:25.297
Hi, Terry.

35:25.340 --> 35:26.950
Here's the man of the hour.

35:26.994 --> 35:28.474
Hello.

35:32.217 --> 35:34.784
Hey.

35:34.828 --> 35:36.482
So what do you think?

35:36.525 --> 35:39.441
I... It's amazing I mean,

35:39.485 --> 35:41.269
I don't even know
what to say, Mom.

35:41.313 --> 35:42.662
And, oh, the food,

35:42.705 --> 35:46.361
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it... it's perfect.

35:46.405 --> 35:47.928
You know
I don't wanna hold you back.

35:47.971 --> 35:50.148
You go talk to your friends.

35:50.191 --> 35:52.106
- Okay.
- Okay. All right.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.257
Come on, I've got two
I really want you to meet.

35:53.281 --> 35:55.414
You're gonna love them.

35:55.457 --> 35:56.913
Kind of surprised.
I just missed being

35:56.937 --> 35:58.852
in Cameron's wedding.
I'm so excited.

35:58.895 --> 36:00.593
Babe, this is Nate and Savannah.

36:00.636 --> 36:01.787
They're who
I was telling you about.

36:01.811 --> 36:03.204
- Great to meet you.
- You too.

36:03.248 --> 36:04.355
We've been dying to meet the guy

36:04.379 --> 36:06.468
who swept Cameron off her feet.

36:06.512 --> 36:08.775
Now I can see
why she fell in love you.

36:08.818 --> 36:09.818
- Ah.
- Aw.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.232
Um, can I get you guys a refill?

36:31.276 --> 36:33.060
- Sure.
- Yeah. Vodka Martini?

36:33.103 --> 36:34.714
- No vermouth, please.
- Same here.

36:34.757 --> 36:37.412
- Be right back, babe.
- Okay.

36:37.456 --> 36:38.761
Isn't he a love?

36:38.805 --> 36:39.893
That was really cute.

36:39.936 --> 36:41.634
He's great.

37:24.938 --> 37:26.722
- So I was like, yeah.
- Here we go.

37:26.766 --> 37:28.855
- Thank you.
- Oh, thank you.

37:28.898 --> 37:30.615
- Yeah, that sure took a while.
- Oh, the bartender

37:30.639 --> 37:32.313
messed up the order.
He's trying to get, um,

37:32.337 --> 37:33.903
make that dirty Margarita
that you like.

37:33.947 --> 37:34.948
Ooh.

37:55.229 --> 37:57.318
What's more, we had
to spend the night in our car,

37:57.362 --> 37:59.320
because your wife
had lost her hotel room

37:59.364 --> 38:00.495
in a poker game.

38:00.539 --> 38:02.758
- What?
- Hey, that hand was not my fault.

38:05.674 --> 38:08.024
She was such a wildcat.

38:08.068 --> 38:09.591
But in the best possible way.

38:09.635 --> 38:12.551
- Oh, sure.
- Yeah.

38:19.384 --> 38:20.384
Oh, who's that?

38:23.692 --> 38:26.042
There they are.

38:26.086 --> 38:27.086
The happy couple.

38:29.481 --> 38:32.353
I'm so sorry, I don't believe
we've been properly introduced.

38:32.397 --> 38:34.050
I'm his sister.

38:34.094 --> 38:35.878
I'm so glad we finally meet.

38:38.533 --> 38:40.970
Oh, my God.
Brent, you didn't tell me

38:41.014 --> 38:42.407
you had family over here.

38:42.450 --> 38:43.775
You said
all of your family and friends

38:43.799 --> 38:44.800
were on the West Coast.

38:44.844 --> 38:47.281
Yeah. I did.

38:47.325 --> 38:48.824
How strong
were those dirty Margaritas

38:48.848 --> 38:50.806
you guys had again?

38:50.850 --> 38:53.113
He doesn't really like
to talk about me.

38:53.156 --> 38:55.724
I got all the good looks
and social graces

38:55.768 --> 38:58.336
and Brent got all the leftovers.

38:59.685 --> 39:01.339
Oh, well, this is great.

39:01.382 --> 39:03.428
I guess now I finally get
to hear all the stories

39:03.471 --> 39:05.038
about what this guy
was like as a kid.

39:05.081 --> 39:08.650
I have so many stories
that you need to hear.

39:08.694 --> 39:10.739
Excuse me.
I'm afraid those stories

39:10.783 --> 39:12.088
are gonna have to wait.

39:12.132 --> 39:14.177
Everyone, dinner is served.

39:14.221 --> 39:15.309
Oh, great, I'm starving.

39:15.353 --> 39:16.745
Yeah.

39:27.060 --> 39:30.977
What do you make of her?

39:31.020 --> 39:34.372
Brent told me
he didn't have any family.

39:34.415 --> 39:36.112
Oh, this is a fantastic day.

39:36.156 --> 39:38.201
Can you agree? Oh, my God.

39:38.245 --> 39:39.899
I love this.

39:39.942 --> 39:42.336
I really... I really
have always wanted a sister.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.251
It's going to be great.

39:44.294 --> 39:45.861
We're gonna do
all the fun stuff.

39:45.905 --> 39:49.299
Brent isn't one
for mani-pedi nights, trust me.

39:49.343 --> 39:51.737
So what do we need to know
about your brother?

39:51.780 --> 39:53.478
Any family secrets?

39:53.521 --> 39:55.915
Oh, there's lots.

39:55.958 --> 39:59.005
Have you told them
about Uncle Lloyd?

39:59.048 --> 40:01.616
Uncle Lloyd, no, of course not.

40:01.660 --> 40:02.791
You should.

40:02.835 --> 40:05.272
Why don't you tell them?

40:05.315 --> 40:07.970
He was our crazy uncle
who would show up

40:08.014 --> 40:11.496
at inappropriate times
and ruin family get-togethers.

40:11.539 --> 40:13.411
Isn't that right, Tara?

40:13.454 --> 40:16.936
Well you know, we all have
that one crazy family member

40:16.979 --> 40:20.722
that no one wants to talk about.

40:20.766 --> 40:22.028
Would you, uh, excuse me?

40:22.071 --> 40:24.596
Oh, sure.

40:24.639 --> 40:26.554
She is a doll.

40:26.598 --> 40:29.122
Yeah. She's a peach.
Um, excuse me.

40:32.517 --> 40:34.214
Well, that's some surprise, huh?

40:42.309 --> 40:45.660
What the hell
are you doing here?

40:45.704 --> 40:48.837
I wanted to see you
squirm a little,

40:48.881 --> 40:51.057
let you know how it feels
to be on the receiving end

40:51.100 --> 40:54.539
of some... How did you put it?

40:54.582 --> 40:56.541
Oh, yeah.

40:56.584 --> 40:58.978
Improvisation.

40:59.021 --> 41:00.632
Well, it's a stupid idea.

41:00.675 --> 41:02.155
You're gonna ruin everything.

41:02.198 --> 41:03.722
No.

41:03.765 --> 41:06.551
That's exactly why
I need to be here.

41:06.594 --> 41:08.509
To make sure you don't.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.866
Now I think it's time
for dessert.

41:29.574 --> 41:30.966
Do it.

41:44.197 --> 41:47.113
I got the EpiPen from her purse.

41:47.156 --> 41:49.202
Did you get the one
from the bathroom?

41:59.865 --> 42:00.866
One bite...

42:02.258 --> 42:04.434
and the money is all ours.

42:13.705 --> 42:15.620
Who's ready for cupcakes?

42:18.666 --> 42:20.973
I, uh, wanna say a few words,

42:21.016 --> 42:24.150
since my brother did some
improvising with the wedding.

42:24.193 --> 42:26.587
I just wanna say
that Brent has told me so much

42:26.631 --> 42:28.894
about his new family
that I feel like

42:28.937 --> 42:31.113
I know you both already.

42:31.157 --> 42:32.724
Nicole, I know that you guys

42:32.767 --> 42:34.987
got off to a little bit
of a bumpy start,

42:35.030 --> 42:37.119
but let's be honest,

42:37.163 --> 42:39.818
it's asking a lot of someone
to have a man show up and say,

42:39.861 --> 42:42.516
"Hey, you've never
met me before.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.997
But I'd like
to marry your daughter."

42:45.040 --> 42:48.217
But from everything I've seen,

42:48.261 --> 42:51.133
you've welcomed Brent and today

42:51.177 --> 42:53.571
maybe me and into your family.

42:55.790 --> 43:00.186
And Cameron,
keep an eye on this one.

43:01.709 --> 43:03.058
Excuse me for a minute.

43:03.102 --> 43:04.843
- Grace.
- Oh, of course.

43:04.886 --> 43:06.496
I'll get the champagne.

43:10.631 --> 43:13.199
Pink is for the blushing bride.

43:13.242 --> 43:15.157
Oh.

43:15.201 --> 43:17.072
I just wanna say

43:17.116 --> 43:20.946
how glad I am
Brent met someone like you,

43:20.989 --> 43:24.384
and that you're willing
to put up with someone like him.

43:24.427 --> 43:27.648
So, here's to you, Cameron.

43:27.692 --> 43:28.736
Cheers.

43:41.793 --> 43:43.272
Babe, what's wrong?

43:43.316 --> 43:45.013
Babe.

43:46.711 --> 43:48.843
Babe.

43:48.887 --> 43:51.019
- Cameron?
- Breathe. Breathe.

43:51.063 --> 43:52.891
She's in anaphylactic shock.

43:52.934 --> 43:54.632
Call 911.

43:54.675 --> 43:56.155
Grace, get her purse.

43:56.198 --> 43:58.679
I got it. I got it.

43:58.723 --> 44:00.986
Come on, just breathe. Breathe.

44:01.029 --> 44:02.335
Hurry up, Grace.

44:02.378 --> 44:04.685
It's not in here.

44:04.729 --> 44:06.054
The bathroom
there's another EpiPen

44:06.078 --> 44:07.079
in the bathroom.

44:29.623 --> 44:31.320
- It's not in there.
- What?

44:31.364 --> 44:32.384
Did you check the side drawer
in the kitchen sink?

44:32.408 --> 44:33.758
Yes. It's not in there.

44:33.801 --> 44:36.108
I must have forgotten
to get a refill.

44:36.151 --> 44:38.197
Cam, stay with me, baby.

44:38.240 --> 44:39.328
Stay with me.

44:39.372 --> 44:40.492
Okay. 911 has been called.

44:43.071 --> 44:45.770
Your daughter
was extremely lucky today.

44:45.813 --> 44:49.077
If there wasn't an EMT
so close by,

44:49.121 --> 44:52.559
I think we'd be having
a very different conversation.

44:52.602 --> 44:54.300
As it is, Cameron,

44:54.343 --> 44:56.955
you'll probably feel
a little dizzy

44:56.998 --> 45:00.219
but there won't be
any long-lasting effects.

45:00.262 --> 45:03.439
We should have you out of here
in the next 24 hours.

45:03.483 --> 45:04.832
Thank God for that.

45:04.876 --> 45:06.442
What caused it?

45:06.486 --> 45:09.228
Most likely was something
that you ate.

45:09.271 --> 45:11.317
But the caterer knew
about her allergy.

45:11.360 --> 45:13.014
I was guaranteed that nothing

45:13.058 --> 45:14.862
would have any nuts in it.
Then he screwed up.

45:14.886 --> 45:16.472
Well, it's not uncommon
for there to be

45:16.496 --> 45:19.586
some cross-contamination
in the preparation of food.

45:19.629 --> 45:21.588
But whatever caused this

45:21.631 --> 45:24.417
would've been
a lot stronger than that.

45:24.460 --> 45:26.854
That's why it's imperative
to keep an EpiPen with you

45:26.898 --> 45:29.074
wherever you go.

45:29.117 --> 45:33.426
- But there was one in my purse.
- It wasn't there, babe.

45:33.469 --> 45:34.490
And I guess I forgot to replace

45:34.514 --> 45:35.558
the one in the bathroom.

45:35.602 --> 45:37.299
I'm so sorry, Cam.

45:37.343 --> 45:38.363
All right, I have a couple here

45:38.387 --> 45:39.824
that I could send you home with.

45:39.867 --> 45:42.130
For now, I want to keep you
here overnight

45:42.174 --> 45:44.480
just to make sure
that you're clear.

45:44.524 --> 45:45.786
Thank you, doctor.

45:45.830 --> 45:49.181
Very much.

45:49.224 --> 45:52.184
I know what you're gonna say.

45:52.227 --> 45:54.447
Don't pay the caterer?

45:54.490 --> 45:57.102
Well, we don't have
to worry about that.

45:57.145 --> 45:59.582
Brent tore them a new one
on the phone.

45:59.626 --> 46:02.020
It was amazing.
He was relentless.

46:43.322 --> 46:44.627
Oh, no.

46:44.671 --> 46:46.586
What is it?

46:46.629 --> 46:50.111
Grace says there's
some emergency at the office.

46:50.155 --> 46:52.722
This late at night?

46:52.766 --> 46:55.813
- Any idea what it is?
- It's probably nothing.

47:21.621 --> 47:23.666
Hey.

47:23.710 --> 47:26.191
With all that's been going on,
the party

47:26.234 --> 47:29.194
and now you getting sick,

47:29.237 --> 47:32.806
maybe when you're feeling better
we could do something together.

47:32.850 --> 47:35.548
- Hmm, like what?
- Well, I married you so fast

47:35.591 --> 47:38.377
we never got a chance
to go on a honeymoon together.

47:38.420 --> 47:41.249
That sounds amazing.

47:41.293 --> 47:43.295
Everything okay?

47:43.338 --> 47:45.514
Yeah. I mean, I guess so.
Went to voicemail,

47:45.558 --> 47:48.735
but I'm sure whatever it is,
Grace can handle it.

47:48.778 --> 47:50.824
I'm gonna stay here
with you, okay?

47:50.868 --> 47:52.130
No, no.

47:52.173 --> 47:54.872
I'm fine, plus Brent's here.

47:54.915 --> 47:58.527
And I can already feel whatever
the doctor gave me kicking in.

47:58.571 --> 48:00.790
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

48:00.834 --> 48:02.967
Let me walk you to your car.

48:03.010 --> 48:04.882
Good night, baby.

48:07.885 --> 48:09.253
You'll take care of her
for me, won't you?

48:09.277 --> 48:10.583
Yeah, of course.

48:10.626 --> 48:12.454
Stay here all night
if they let me.

48:12.498 --> 48:14.892
All right. I'll come back
as soon as I can.

49:01.764 --> 49:04.115
Don't do that.

49:04.158 --> 49:07.596
Give me one good reason not to.

49:07.640 --> 49:08.922
How about
the 20 security cameras

49:08.946 --> 49:10.860
you passed on the way in here?

49:10.904 --> 49:12.099
You don't think somebody's
gonna recognize you

49:12.123 --> 49:14.342
from the party that you crashed?

49:14.386 --> 49:17.128
You kill this girl
in a sterile hospital,

49:17.171 --> 49:19.391
everyone's gonna look at me.

49:19.434 --> 49:21.567
And that $3 million is gone.

49:28.835 --> 49:31.490
All right, you two,
visiting hours are over.

49:33.013 --> 49:34.493
Now scoot.

49:37.887 --> 49:39.498
If you think I'm going
to sit through

49:39.541 --> 49:41.195
any more nights of you in bed

49:41.239 --> 49:44.068
with that spoiled bitch,
you are dead wrong.

49:46.853 --> 49:49.638
Time's up.

49:49.682 --> 49:52.424
She's 25, the money is there,

49:52.467 --> 49:55.775
let's get this over with
and move on.

49:55.818 --> 49:58.212
Is this some kind of game
to you?

49:58.256 --> 50:00.171
I'm not the one
who couldn't follow through

50:00.214 --> 50:02.956
on what needed to be done.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.045
What is that supposed to mean?

50:05.089 --> 50:07.613
You left that EpiPen
in the bathroom.

50:07.656 --> 50:10.529
I had to pull it just like
I have to do everything.

50:10.572 --> 50:12.487
I moved it.

50:12.531 --> 50:14.750
You left it there
because you don't have the guts

50:14.794 --> 50:17.057
to go all the way.

50:17.101 --> 50:19.929
I've seen the way
you look at her.

50:19.973 --> 50:22.323
You've never looked
at me that way.

50:26.936 --> 50:28.068
You know that's not true.

50:28.112 --> 50:30.070
You switched the cupcakes.

50:30.114 --> 50:32.290
Because Nicole was suspicious.

50:32.333 --> 50:33.595
She already didn't trust me

50:33.639 --> 50:35.249
and then you show up
after I told her

50:35.293 --> 50:37.034
I didn't have any family.

50:37.077 --> 50:38.513
I'll take care of Nicole.

50:38.557 --> 50:40.820
No.

50:40.863 --> 50:43.127
You've got to be smart.

50:43.170 --> 50:45.172
What are you suggesting?

50:45.216 --> 50:46.434
- A honeymoon.
- What?

50:46.478 --> 50:47.478
Shh.

50:48.654 --> 50:50.786
Are you crazy?

50:50.830 --> 50:53.137
Trust me.

50:53.180 --> 50:55.182
You're not playing
a role with me

50:55.226 --> 51:00.405
the same way you are with
her, are you?

51:00.448 --> 51:02.015
You know I'm not.

51:07.412 --> 51:09.414
Prove it.

51:28.476 --> 51:29.651
Grace?

51:37.877 --> 51:38.877
Evening, Ms. Winters.

51:42.969 --> 51:44.773
You said there
was an office emergency.

51:44.797 --> 51:45.885
You sent me a text.

51:45.928 --> 51:48.844
No. I didn't send one.

51:48.888 --> 51:51.108
Look, it's... it's not even
turned on.

51:51.151 --> 51:53.893
I must have powered it off
when I put it in the charger.

51:57.810 --> 52:00.160
There's no sent text to me,
but I got one.

52:00.204 --> 52:03.381
Well, I didn't send it.

52:03.424 --> 52:06.210
Listen, sweetheart,
it has been a long day.

52:06.253 --> 52:09.604
We had the party
and the scare with Cameron.

52:09.648 --> 52:13.347
No. No, something
really strange is happening.

52:13.391 --> 52:16.220
I spoke to Brent tonight,
I asked him about his sister.

52:16.263 --> 52:19.048
He said, "I never told you
that I was an only child."

52:19.092 --> 52:20.746
And I could have sworn
that's exactly

52:20.789 --> 52:22.661
what he said to me.

52:22.704 --> 52:24.144
And then I'm looking
through my phone

52:24.184 --> 52:27.187
trying to find a picture
of Tara at the party

52:27.231 --> 52:29.755
and every single picture,
her head is turned,

52:29.798 --> 52:31.167
like she didn't wanna
be photographed.

52:31.191 --> 52:33.193
No, I think I got one.

52:33.237 --> 52:35.978
Here.

52:36.022 --> 52:37.676
And that necklace.

52:37.719 --> 52:39.373
Grace, that necklace.

52:39.417 --> 52:41.462
I was with Brent
when he bought it.

52:41.506 --> 52:45.031
He told me
it was a present for Cameron.

52:45.074 --> 52:46.554
Listen. Sweetheart,

52:46.598 --> 52:49.035
I'm gonna look into this
for you, okay?

52:49.078 --> 52:52.169
Yes. And right now,
I want you to make me a drink.

52:52.212 --> 52:53.300
Okay.

52:53.344 --> 52:54.606
Okay. You got it. Come on.

52:54.649 --> 52:55.694
Okay. Oh.

53:00.002 --> 53:02.527
What about this one?

53:02.570 --> 53:04.442
No, that's not her.

53:04.485 --> 53:08.533
Here, try this,
Tara Holvik, H-O-L-V-I-K.

53:08.576 --> 53:10.056
What's that?

53:10.099 --> 53:13.102
That's Brent's real last name.

53:13.146 --> 53:16.149
Oh, nothing on social media.

53:16.193 --> 53:18.673
Wait a minute.
This is interesting.

53:18.717 --> 53:22.068
There's public record
with an address,

53:22.111 --> 53:24.549
it's from few years back.
That's right upstate.

53:24.592 --> 53:27.465
Oh, let me see what I can
dig up on this address.

53:28.814 --> 53:30.381
Thanks, Grace.

53:30.424 --> 53:31.556
Of course.

53:45.874 --> 53:48.137
- Hi.
- What the hell?

53:48.181 --> 53:49.313
What are you doing here?

53:52.446 --> 53:54.274
What is this?

53:54.318 --> 53:57.321
It's the house on the lake

53:57.364 --> 54:00.367
that "Rigo" is going to
let you stay at

54:00.411 --> 54:04.066
before you kick off
your dream honeymoon.

54:04.110 --> 54:05.546
That's where you're taking her.

54:05.590 --> 54:07.418
And whose house is this?

54:07.461 --> 54:09.202
It is a property held in trust

54:09.246 --> 54:11.987
by Rader's law firm.

54:12.031 --> 54:14.076
Don't worry,

54:14.120 --> 54:16.383
I confirmed that the owners
will be out of the country

54:16.427 --> 54:18.951
through the end of the year.

54:18.994 --> 54:20.909
This is where
we'll finally do it.

54:20.953 --> 54:23.216
Kill your wife.

54:25.218 --> 54:27.264
The property is right
on the lake,

54:27.307 --> 54:31.268
it is the perfect place
for someone to have an accident,

54:31.311 --> 54:34.358
get themselves drowned.

54:34.401 --> 54:36.882
It could take days
to find the body,

54:36.925 --> 54:39.667
and then you legally get

54:39.711 --> 54:42.888
every last penny
of that $3 million

54:42.931 --> 54:45.499
free and clear

54:47.849 --> 54:51.244
and then we get to spend
the rest of our lives together.

54:51.288 --> 54:52.985
Right.

54:55.814 --> 54:58.469
So, first we have the
Mont Saint-Michel on Saturday

54:58.512 --> 54:59.818
and we'll stay on the coast,

54:59.861 --> 55:01.994
before we travel up to "Paree."

55:02.037 --> 55:04.277
And if we're going to Paris,
we have to see the Eiffel Tower.

55:04.301 --> 55:08.043
Oh, the Eiffel Tower? Come on.
It's just so...

55:08.087 --> 55:09.610
Touristy?

55:09.654 --> 55:12.091
- Yeah.
- I know. I know. But...

55:12.134 --> 55:14.267
Oh, come on, we're going
all the way to Paris.

55:14.311 --> 55:17.357
Hey, I'm gonna honeymoon you
all over France, okay?

55:17.401 --> 55:20.839
But first,
I got a surprise for you.

55:20.882 --> 55:23.537
Rigo has a house upon the lake
that he offered to let us use,

55:23.581 --> 55:25.713
so I was thinking that you
and I could go there,

55:25.757 --> 55:29.282
just the two of us,
before we fly off.

55:29.326 --> 55:31.458
All the people in all the world,

55:31.502 --> 55:32.938
and somehow I found you.

55:35.462 --> 55:39.205
I'm just lucky, I guess.

55:39.248 --> 55:41.076
So we're gonna get
started off easy,

55:41.120 --> 55:42.489
talk a little bit
about your daughter,

55:42.513 --> 55:43.751
and you can go right
into your sales pitch.

55:43.775 --> 55:45.080
Okay. Sounds great.

55:45.124 --> 55:46.908
All right.
Let's get started then.

55:48.606 --> 55:50.434
Tara's updated address.

55:50.477 --> 55:52.436
I'm driving up there
to talk to her.

55:52.479 --> 55:55.221
I wish I could go with you,
but where is it?

55:55.264 --> 55:57.005
Rochester, it won't take long.

55:57.049 --> 55:58.703
I'll meet you for dinner
and I'll call you

55:58.746 --> 56:00.095
if I find out anything.

56:00.139 --> 56:02.402
- All right.
- Uh, do well.

56:02.446 --> 56:03.534
Drive safe.

56:03.577 --> 56:05.449
Safe is my middle name.

56:07.233 --> 56:08.887
All right, Nicole,
let's get started.

56:08.930 --> 56:10.497
Okay.

56:56.151 --> 56:58.589
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

56:58.632 --> 57:01.374
Yeah. I'm... I'm looking
for a Tara Holvik.

57:01.418 --> 57:03.463
I think she might be
a nurse here.

57:03.507 --> 57:06.423
No. Not exactly.
She's a patient.

57:06.466 --> 57:08.599
Are you a friend or family?

57:08.642 --> 57:13.342
Oh, a friend of the family.
I... I know her brother.

57:13.386 --> 57:14.996
Okay. Follow me.

57:17.129 --> 57:18.652
Tara, there's
someone here to see you,

57:18.696 --> 57:20.349
a friend of your brother's.

57:25.137 --> 57:27.139
You know Brent?

57:29.968 --> 57:31.665
Yes.

57:31.709 --> 57:33.537
Yes. I do.

57:39.586 --> 57:42.023
Oh, hey, Nic, it's me.

57:42.067 --> 57:44.765
Listen, I... I just spent
a half an hour with her.

57:44.809 --> 57:46.506
It's Brent's sister, all right.

57:46.550 --> 57:50.641
She's a long-term patient here
in... in a wheelchair.

57:50.684 --> 57:52.425
She's needed
assisted-care living

57:52.469 --> 57:54.166
for the last decade.

57:54.209 --> 57:56.560
So whoever that was
at the reception,

57:56.603 --> 58:00.085
it was not Tara Holvik.

58:00.128 --> 58:02.000
I... I'll
just see you at dinner,

58:02.043 --> 58:05.786
I have a lot more
than I need to...

58:17.885 --> 58:19.757
If you are satisfied
with your message

58:19.800 --> 58:21.802
and would like to send,
press one.

58:21.846 --> 58:24.457
If you'd like to delete
your message, press two.

58:24.501 --> 58:25.501
Yeah.

58:59.927 --> 59:02.060
Oh, bingo.

59:09.023 --> 59:10.895
Night desk, can I help you?

59:10.938 --> 59:13.680
Hi. Yeah. A friend of mine
came in there earlier today

59:13.724 --> 59:15.726
to check on my daughter-in-law,

59:15.769 --> 59:17.597
Tara Holvik?

59:17.641 --> 59:19.425
Yes, she was here.

59:19.468 --> 59:21.688
Um, I was just wondering

59:21.732 --> 59:24.212
if maybe something
strange happened?

59:24.256 --> 59:26.693
She was supposed
to come back here

59:26.737 --> 59:29.478
and meet me for dinner
and she didn't show up.

59:29.522 --> 59:31.306
No, nothing strange.

59:31.350 --> 59:33.439
She was here
for about 30 minutes,

59:33.482 --> 59:34.962
and then she left.

59:36.485 --> 59:38.923
Okay. Well, thank you very much.

59:38.966 --> 59:40.315
Bye.

01:00:00.684 --> 01:00:02.207
Shh.

01:00:04.731 --> 01:00:09.040
Get out of bed and follow me.

01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:40.264
So do you wanna tell me
what the hell is going on

01:00:40.288 --> 01:00:41.507
or do I have to guess?

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:54.389
Oh, my God. What the...

01:00:56.522 --> 01:00:59.568
I did what needed to be done.

01:00:59.612 --> 01:01:02.093
She went and found your sister.

01:01:02.136 --> 01:01:04.878
I can't believe you killed her.

01:01:04.922 --> 01:01:08.099
She was going to tell Nicole.

01:01:08.142 --> 01:01:10.884
Nobody gets between us
and that money.

01:01:10.928 --> 01:01:12.538
Now give me a hand.

01:01:31.557 --> 01:01:33.037
You have the tickets?

01:01:34.473 --> 01:01:36.780
You have the address.

01:01:36.823 --> 01:01:39.608
I'll follow you up tomorrow.

01:01:39.652 --> 01:01:42.002
As soon as the sun goes down,

01:01:42.046 --> 01:01:45.005
bring your wife down
to the wine cellar.

01:01:47.312 --> 01:01:50.315
We'll need all night
to take care of her body.

01:01:51.969 --> 01:01:53.448
Okay.

01:01:54.928 --> 01:01:56.364
Okay.

01:02:12.076 --> 01:02:14.905
Good morning, sleepyhead.
I made you breakfast.

01:02:14.948 --> 01:02:16.820
Uh, unfortunately, I got to run.

01:02:16.863 --> 01:02:19.779
- Oh.
- Oh, but I'll take one to go.

01:02:19.823 --> 01:02:21.670
I just got to go over a few
things with the contractor.

01:02:21.694 --> 01:02:24.131
When I get back,
we'll be on our way.

01:02:24.175 --> 01:02:26.525
Ah-ah-ah.

01:02:26.568 --> 01:02:28.179
You are forgetting something.

01:02:35.403 --> 01:02:37.797
- I'll be back soon.
- You promise?

01:02:37.841 --> 01:02:38.841
I promise.

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:41.932
Okay.

01:02:46.675 --> 01:02:48.286
I know, I spoke
to someone yesterday

01:02:48.329 --> 01:02:49.983
and they said the same thing,

01:02:50.027 --> 01:02:51.700
that she can't be classified
as a missing person

01:02:51.724 --> 01:02:52.943
for 24 hours.

01:02:54.379 --> 01:02:59.123
Yes. I know,
but this isn't like her and...

01:02:59.166 --> 01:03:01.386
Okay.

01:03:01.429 --> 01:03:03.344
All right, thank you, officer.

01:03:03.388 --> 01:03:05.564
All right, I'll call back.

01:03:34.636 --> 01:03:35.724
Hey.

01:03:38.858 --> 01:03:40.904
- Are you here?
- Don't move.

01:03:40.947 --> 01:03:42.949
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! It's me.

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:46.648
Brent.

01:03:46.692 --> 01:03:48.128
What are you doing here?

01:03:49.782 --> 01:03:51.151
You're supposed to be
on your way up

01:03:51.175 --> 01:03:52.654
to the lake house.

01:03:52.698 --> 01:03:54.526
I had to see you,

01:03:54.569 --> 01:03:56.354
I needed to do something first.

01:03:58.486 --> 01:03:59.661
Do what?

01:04:05.058 --> 01:04:07.756
I want you to know, before I go,

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:10.629
exactly what I feel for you.

01:04:10.672 --> 01:04:12.761
I love you, Lex.

01:04:12.805 --> 01:04:15.068
After all this is over,

01:04:15.112 --> 01:04:17.592
I wanna make you mine
for the rest of my life.

01:04:22.554 --> 01:04:24.338
Go see how it
sparkles in the light.

01:04:29.953 --> 01:04:33.173
You just made me
the happiest girl in the world.

01:04:33.217 --> 01:04:34.653
Oh.

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:48.754
I haven't seen Brent
since the accident.

01:04:51.017 --> 01:04:54.934
The nerve damage
just kept getting worse.

01:04:54.978 --> 01:04:56.893
I couldn't take care
of myself anymore.

01:04:58.068 --> 01:04:59.983
That's how I ended up here.

01:05:02.202 --> 01:05:04.465
Like it wasn't
bad enough already

01:05:04.509 --> 01:05:06.119
to lose our parents
in that crash.

01:05:09.601 --> 01:05:13.344
Anyway a while after,

01:05:13.387 --> 01:05:17.870
I received a letter informing me
that Brent was in prison

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:19.567
somewhere out west.

01:05:19.611 --> 01:05:21.874
I don't remember
what he was convicted of,

01:05:23.832 --> 01:05:26.661
but even after he got out
he never came to see me.

01:05:26.705 --> 01:05:28.185
I'm so sorry.

01:05:30.578 --> 01:05:33.494
What about a, uh, a non-profit

01:05:33.538 --> 01:05:36.671
revamping infrastructure
in the developing world.

01:05:36.715 --> 01:05:38.630
He said he was a contractor.

01:05:38.673 --> 01:05:40.197
Contractor?

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.850
That doesn't sound like him.

01:05:44.505 --> 01:05:46.899
He also said he is friends
with somebody who grew up

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:48.640
with the Guatemalan president.

01:05:50.294 --> 01:05:53.775
Here's what I know about Brent,

01:05:53.819 --> 01:05:56.015
and I told this to your friend
when she was down here earlier.

01:05:56.039 --> 01:05:57.736
He's dangerous.

01:05:57.779 --> 01:05:59.999
Be careful.

01:06:00.043 --> 01:06:03.263
Accidents happen to people
who get too close to him.

01:06:04.656 --> 01:06:07.093
Where is he now?

01:06:07.137 --> 01:06:08.486
With my daughter.

01:06:15.145 --> 01:06:16.146
I love you.

01:06:32.031 --> 01:06:33.990
Honeymoon itinerary.

01:06:35.513 --> 01:06:36.949
Got it.

01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:38.037
Thanks, Cam.

01:07:13.116 --> 01:07:14.900
What do you think?

01:07:14.943 --> 01:07:16.728
Oh, my gosh.

01:07:16.771 --> 01:07:18.947
Great, right?

01:07:18.991 --> 01:07:20.427
I don't know
what I was expecting

01:07:20.471 --> 01:07:22.821
but this is amazing.

01:07:22.864 --> 01:07:24.146
How much is Rigo
charging us with this?

01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:25.998
It's all taken care of.

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:27.682
This is the surprise
I've been working on.

01:07:30.611 --> 01:07:32.135
That view was incredible.

01:07:32.178 --> 01:07:33.962
And it's just the two of us.

01:07:34.006 --> 01:07:35.616
No distractions.

01:07:38.445 --> 01:07:40.578
Mm-hmm.

01:07:40.621 --> 01:07:42.817
What am I supposed to do
for a week without Instagram?

01:07:42.841 --> 01:07:44.843
I am not sharing you
with anyone,

01:07:44.886 --> 01:07:46.236
especially Instagram.

01:07:48.934 --> 01:07:50.544
Now, wait
'til you see the inside.

01:08:02.469 --> 01:08:03.731
Oh.

01:08:05.168 --> 01:08:07.779
Oh, it's perfect.

01:08:07.822 --> 01:08:09.476
All right,
save a little excitement.

01:08:14.568 --> 01:08:16.353
Oh, look at that fireplace.

01:08:16.395 --> 01:08:18.572
- You like it?
- Absolutely.

01:08:20.313 --> 01:08:21.812
I want you to have yourself
a look around

01:08:21.836 --> 01:08:23.881
and I'll go get
all of your bags.

01:08:23.925 --> 01:08:25.840
Hmm-hmm-hmm, you're so cute.

01:08:41.769 --> 01:08:43.466
Cameron, baby,
you have to call me

01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:44.642
as soon as you get this.

01:08:44.685 --> 01:08:45.991
It's an emergency.

01:08:46.033 --> 01:08:47.470
I need to talk to u, honey.

01:09:00.223 --> 01:09:02.877
- Hey, close your eyes.
- What?

01:09:02.921 --> 01:09:04.246
Close your eyes,
cover them with your hands

01:09:04.270 --> 01:09:06.054
so you can't see.

01:09:06.098 --> 01:09:08.752
Okay.

01:09:08.796 --> 01:09:12.712
Keep them closed, no peeking.

01:09:12.756 --> 01:09:15.325
I'm not.

01:09:15.368 --> 01:09:19.111
- Okay. Open them.
- What's this?

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:21.157
It's a honeymoon present.

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:23.550
Oh, I feel bad
I didn't get you anything.

01:09:23.594 --> 01:09:24.638
Are you kidding me?

01:09:24.682 --> 01:09:26.073
Look around.

01:09:26.118 --> 01:09:28.381
This is the present
you've given me

01:09:28.425 --> 01:09:30.818
and now it's my turn
to give you one.

01:09:30.862 --> 01:09:32.515
- Open it. Open it.
- Okay.

01:09:45.484 --> 01:09:46.965
It's a house.

01:09:47.008 --> 01:09:48.009
Our house.

01:09:48.053 --> 01:09:50.229
Wow.

01:09:50.273 --> 01:09:54.015
That's... That's amazing.

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:05.462
Hey, what is it?

01:10:05.505 --> 01:10:09.117
No, it's just, uh,

01:10:09.161 --> 01:10:10.467
I never knew how much two people

01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:12.773
could really love each other

01:10:12.817 --> 01:10:14.079
until I met you.

01:10:16.037 --> 01:10:18.692
I love you so much, Cam.

01:10:18.736 --> 01:10:20.303
And I'll love you forever.

01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:47.199
Tara?

01:10:49.375 --> 01:10:50.985
What are you doing here?

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:00.256
Ha!

01:11:01.779 --> 01:11:03.737
Run.

01:11:18.317 --> 01:11:20.754
Where's my phone, where's
my phone, where's my phone?

01:11:36.161 --> 01:11:37.293
Cam.

01:11:46.258 --> 01:11:49.522
Cameron, are you in here?

01:11:49.566 --> 01:11:53.134
Aah!

01:11:53.178 --> 01:11:57.051
I've had just about enough
of you saying her name.

01:12:27.821 --> 01:12:31.825
Now I have to attend
to your blushing bride.

01:12:35.089 --> 01:12:38.702
Just...
rest easy 'til I get back.

01:13:26.445 --> 01:13:28.360
Aaah!

01:14:11.403 --> 01:14:14.014
Why are you doing this?
You're Brent's sister.

01:14:14.058 --> 01:14:15.494
Right.

01:14:24.895 --> 01:14:27.811
You know, I have to admit.

01:14:27.854 --> 01:14:29.682
That's a little bit of a lie.

01:14:31.336 --> 01:14:32.946
Who are you?

01:14:34.731 --> 01:14:37.734
As far as you're concerned,
I am...

01:14:37.777 --> 01:14:38.778
nobody.

01:14:40.606 --> 01:14:42.652
I'm nothing.

01:14:42.695 --> 01:14:44.044
What are you talking about?

01:14:45.524 --> 01:14:48.701
I'm talking about you, Cam.

01:14:48.745 --> 01:14:54.272
You know, my entire life
I've had to fight.

01:14:54.315 --> 01:14:57.667
I fought everyone and everything
that stood in my way.

01:14:57.710 --> 01:15:04.021
Teachers, counselors,
the system.

01:15:04.064 --> 01:15:05.805
But it was never enough.

01:15:08.068 --> 01:15:09.896
There are always people
like you.

01:15:11.419 --> 01:15:13.247
People who had it all.

01:15:24.041 --> 01:15:27.087
So I made up my mind

01:15:27.131 --> 01:15:31.570
to find some
poor little rich girl

01:15:31.614 --> 01:15:34.399
and take everything from her.

01:15:44.061 --> 01:15:45.976
Wait.

01:15:46.019 --> 01:15:48.413
You know how much money I have.

01:15:48.456 --> 01:15:51.198
Well, my mom has more,

01:15:51.242 --> 01:15:53.679
she'll pay you
to let me and Brent go.

01:15:53.723 --> 01:15:57.074
Call her, she'll tell you...
Anything you want.

01:16:01.731 --> 01:16:04.168
You and Brent
aren't walking away from here,

01:16:05.952 --> 01:16:08.955
not after everything
I've put into this,

01:16:08.999 --> 01:16:11.175
only to watch him
throw it all away.

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.481
All my work,

01:16:15.614 --> 01:16:18.791
coming up with every detail,

01:16:18.835 --> 01:16:23.187
studying your idiotic
social media posts,

01:16:23.230 --> 01:16:25.711
training him to be the man
you would fall for

01:16:25.755 --> 01:16:29.323
just like that.

01:16:29.367 --> 01:16:30.890
What do you mean?

01:16:32.762 --> 01:16:34.241
Oh, he didn't tell you?

01:16:35.852 --> 01:16:38.376
Everything with him
has been an act.

01:16:40.421 --> 01:16:42.032
A lie.

01:16:42.075 --> 01:16:44.904
Now I'm going
to make him suffer,

01:16:44.948 --> 01:16:47.994
the same way
that he's made me suffer.

01:16:48.038 --> 01:16:51.345
And unfortunately for you,

01:16:51.389 --> 01:16:55.088
you're the button I push
to make him hurt.

01:17:44.703 --> 01:17:47.967
I don't care
what Brent was before.

01:17:48.011 --> 01:17:53.059
I believe that he loves me,
with or without the money.

01:17:53.103 --> 01:17:57.107
He found something with me
that you could never give him,

01:17:57.150 --> 01:17:58.935
and that's what's
driving you so crazy.

01:18:01.241 --> 01:18:04.157
I'm going to watch his face
when he sees your dead body,

01:18:05.637 --> 01:18:08.379
right before I kill him too.

01:18:08.422 --> 01:18:10.903
It won't change the fact
that Brent loves me,

01:18:10.947 --> 01:18:13.079
not you.

01:18:13.123 --> 01:18:14.167
Oh.

01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:33.012
Don't make this any harder
than it has to be.

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:40.367
You know, I would say
it's been nice knowing you.

01:18:40.411 --> 01:18:41.760
It really hasn't.

01:18:43.936 --> 01:18:44.937
Unh!

01:18:48.636 --> 01:18:50.116
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.291
Are you hurt?

01:18:51.335 --> 01:18:52.597
Okay. Look...

01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:55.600
Get your hands off of her!

01:18:55.643 --> 01:18:57.428
Give it up, Lexi.

01:18:57.471 --> 01:18:58.559
It's over.

01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:00.910
You're right.

01:19:05.349 --> 01:19:06.916
It's over for you.

01:19:08.178 --> 01:19:09.614
Listen to me.

01:19:09.657 --> 01:19:12.008
Okay, put the gun down, now.

01:19:12.051 --> 01:19:13.705
He didn't tell you?

01:19:16.621 --> 01:19:19.319
Right before he picked you up
for this little love jaunt,

01:19:22.366 --> 01:19:23.759
he proposed to me,

01:19:28.633 --> 01:19:30.635
and then he tried to murder me.

01:19:30.678 --> 01:19:32.768
Because you were gonna kill her.

01:19:32.811 --> 01:19:34.987
And you think
you can change that?

01:19:47.957 --> 01:19:50.829
You were always weak,

01:19:50.873 --> 01:19:52.313
right from the beginning
I could tell

01:19:52.352 --> 01:19:53.658
that you didn't have it in you

01:19:53.701 --> 01:19:56.748
to go all the way but...

01:19:56.792 --> 01:20:00.012
I never imagined
that you'd be tempted so easily.

01:20:01.927 --> 01:20:07.019
Think about it,
okay, you kill me,

01:20:07.063 --> 01:20:09.282
and you don't see a penny
of that money, right?

01:20:09.326 --> 01:20:12.111
You think that I still care
about the money.

01:20:12.155 --> 01:20:13.721
I stopped caring about that

01:20:13.765 --> 01:20:15.811
the moment you left me for dead.

01:20:15.854 --> 01:20:17.682
Now this is personal,

01:20:19.858 --> 01:20:21.077
in fact...

01:20:23.427 --> 01:20:26.125
you could say
that it's about love.

01:20:26.169 --> 01:20:28.562
I wanna know
which one of us you love.

01:20:31.087 --> 01:20:32.566
Is it me

01:20:35.091 --> 01:20:36.570
or her?

01:20:45.536 --> 01:20:47.538
- Look, she loves me...
- No, Brent.

01:20:56.155 --> 01:20:57.374
I hate you.

01:21:09.690 --> 01:21:11.518
Now, it's your turn.

01:21:11.562 --> 01:21:13.520
Please, no.

01:21:13.564 --> 01:21:15.000
Cameron.

01:21:15.044 --> 01:21:16.045
Mom.

01:21:18.569 --> 01:21:19.613
Well,

01:21:21.528 --> 01:21:25.663
isn't this a nice,
unexpected twist.

01:21:25.706 --> 01:21:27.012
Stop it, don't touch her!

01:21:27.056 --> 01:21:28.057
Shut up!

01:21:33.018 --> 01:21:35.803
- Cameron, my daughter!
- Mom.

01:21:40.808 --> 01:21:42.245
Brent! Brent!

01:21:42.288 --> 01:21:44.856
Brent, baby, please,
please, look at me.

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:46.118
Stay with me, stay with me,

01:21:46.162 --> 01:21:47.946
stay with me, Brent.

01:21:49.992 --> 01:21:52.820
I love you.

01:21:52.864 --> 01:21:54.735
Never forget that.

01:21:56.868 --> 01:21:57.913
Never.

01:22:00.132 --> 01:22:01.133
Never.

01:22:49.616 --> 01:22:52.228
Oh, who was that?

01:22:52.271 --> 01:22:54.578
- No one important.
- Are you sure?

01:22:54.621 --> 01:22:56.449
Two department store contracts
closing soon.

01:22:56.493 --> 01:22:57.842
They might be able to use you.

01:22:57.885 --> 01:22:58.950
Yeah. Well,
they're gonna have to

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:00.410
do better than this.

01:23:00.453 --> 01:23:02.803
Besides, we have
very important business

01:23:02.847 --> 01:23:04.066
to tend to.

01:23:04.109 --> 01:23:05.328
Hmm, like drinking

01:23:05.371 --> 01:23:07.417
these delicious cocktails?

01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:10.898
Yes. And I noticed
that very cute cabana boy

01:23:10.942 --> 01:23:12.726
over there making eyes at you.

01:23:12.770 --> 01:23:15.294
Uh. No. No. No. No.
No, thank you.

01:23:15.338 --> 01:23:16.576
I have sworn off
of handsome strangers

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:18.428
- from now on.
- Oh, yeah.

01:23:18.471 --> 01:23:20.038
Besides,
my perfect traveling partner

01:23:20.082 --> 01:23:22.171
has been here all along.

01:23:22.214 --> 01:23:23.824
Cheers, Mama.
