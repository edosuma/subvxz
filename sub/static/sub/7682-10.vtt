00:55.579 --> 00:59.583
Anyone who sounds like this
should be home in bed.

00:59.583 --> 01:01.418
The fact is, I was,

01:01.418 --> 01:05.254
but after a weekend
of hearing myself sneeze...

01:05.254 --> 01:07.341
...I was desperate.

01:07.341 --> 01:11.845
So here I am, searching for the
ingredients to an old home remedy.

01:11.845 --> 01:15.307
Excuse me. Can you tell me
where I can find eucalyptus leaves?

01:15.307 --> 01:17.893
Australia.

01:18.811 --> 01:21.396
Thanks for your help.

01:35.452 --> 01:37.788
All right, folks! You know what this is!

01:37.788 --> 01:41.500
Everybody listen up! Do what you're told
and you don't get hurt!

01:41.500 --> 01:45.837
- Hands on your heads, now!
- You, take this bag and fill it.

01:45.837 --> 01:48.006
Hurry up, come on!

01:48.006 --> 01:51.051
I knew I shouldn't have
gotten out of bed this morning.

01:51.051 --> 01:54.221
Move it. You think
we're playing with you? Come on!

01:54.221 --> 01:56.515
My search for a cure for the common cold

01:56.515 --> 02:00.310
turned into finding
a remedy for robbery.

02:00.477 --> 02:02.395
Come on!

02:02.395 --> 02:05.941
I figured some homemade tear gas
just might do the trick.

02:05.941 --> 02:09.318
I'm not playing with you. Gimme that!

02:09.318 --> 02:11.905
Everybody shut up and nobody gets hurt.

02:11.905 --> 02:13.573
You first.

02:13.573 --> 02:18.119
- Don't hurt me! Please!
- Put that stuff in the bag. Let's go!

02:18.119 --> 02:20.747
Forget the checks and coins.

02:24.292 --> 02:27.378
- No, not this!
- Come on. Put it in the bag.

02:27.378 --> 02:30.215
- All right.
- All right, you!

02:31.591 --> 02:36.179
A dash of the right spices,
a little baking soda...

02:36.179 --> 02:38.473
- You too, your watch.
-...vinegar,

02:38.473 --> 02:42.477
and we have the recipe
for a very unpleasant surprise.

02:42.477 --> 02:46.564
Where you going, buddy?
Hold it right there.

02:47.357 --> 02:49.943
That's it.

02:49.943 --> 02:52.570
Okay, people...

02:56.324 --> 02:58.910
The ring too, lady.

03:00.745 --> 03:03.206
Come on, get it off.

03:03.206 --> 03:05.833
Come on, lady.

03:06.292 --> 03:08.920
The necklace, come on, off.

03:10.922 --> 03:12.965
I can't do it any faster.

03:12.965 --> 03:15.676
Hold it! Just freeze where you are.

03:15.676 --> 03:17.970
Give me your wallet
and your watch. Now!

03:17.970 --> 03:20.473
All right, it's yours.

03:20.473 --> 03:22.516
That's it. Get the watch!

03:22.516 --> 03:25.102
It's just a cheapo.

03:44.330 --> 03:46.957
Way to go, kid!

03:55.382 --> 03:59.011
I thought you were going to stay home
and take care of that cold.

03:59.011 --> 04:01.639
I was. I am.

04:01.764 --> 04:04.266
How was I to know
I would walk into a robbery?

04:04.266 --> 04:06.560
Police kept me tied up for hours.

04:06.560 --> 04:09.313
Well, the hidden cost of heroism.

04:09.313 --> 04:12.566
Do yourself a favour.
Go down to the research library,

04:12.566 --> 04:14.985
find the books you want
and go home to bed.

04:14.985 --> 04:16.779
Good morning, MacGyver.

04:16.779 --> 04:20.115
- I thought you were home in bed.
- I'm working on it.

04:20.115 --> 04:22.451
Here you go. That makes it official.

04:22.451 --> 04:26.121
Well, it certainly does.
Congratulations.

04:26.246 --> 04:28.999
- Welcome to the Phoenix Foundation.
- Thank you.

04:28.999 --> 04:33.253
The executive committee met yesterday,
and officially voted Nikki on board.

04:33.253 --> 04:36.089
Oh, hey. That's terrific.

04:36.256 --> 04:39.176
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

04:39.343 --> 04:43.138
You understand this doesn't
necessarily mean we'll work together.

04:43.138 --> 04:46.391
- Oh, of course not.
- It's nothing personal here, mind you.

04:46.391 --> 04:48.810
But we do seem
to work in different ways.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.771
- People...
- I'm a professional.

04:50.771 --> 04:53.482
- You make up stuff as you go.
- Whatever works.

04:53.482 --> 04:54.733
- Right.
- Nikki...

04:54.733 --> 04:58.570
A well-organized plan is better
than a seat-of-the-pants approach.

04:58.570 --> 05:01.031
To each his own. It's not your problem.

05:01.031 --> 05:05.202
If it makes any difference, there is
a specific clause in Nikki's contract

05:05.202 --> 05:08.497
guaranteeing that she
is allowed to work alone.

05:08.497 --> 05:11.082
Unless circumstances dictate otherwise.

05:11.082 --> 05:14.294
All right? Does that clear this up?

05:15.962 --> 05:18.465
Yeah. It's fine.

05:18.465 --> 05:21.051
- Oh, thank you.
- Good.

05:21.134 --> 05:24.846
Go home and take care of your cold.
You, take the rest of the day off.

05:24.846 --> 05:28.058
Just get out of my hair, will you?

05:29.351 --> 05:31.519
Some of us have work to do.

05:31.519 --> 05:34.105
Okay.

05:35.148 --> 05:39.986
- What's gotten into him?
- He gets cranky sometimes.

05:55.209 --> 05:58.630
You ought to watch where you're going!

05:58.630 --> 06:01.257
Hey, give me a hand... Hey!

06:07.055 --> 06:09.682
My wallet!

07:21.336 --> 07:25.299
You let that woman see you?
You're a fool!

07:25.299 --> 07:28.844
How can you be so careless?
The freedom of Markus is at stake.

07:28.844 --> 07:31.972
I never signed on
to get in this deep to begin with.

07:31.972 --> 07:35.100
I'm supposed to be a supplier,
not a delivery boy.

07:35.100 --> 07:37.603
In for a penny, in for a pound.

07:37.603 --> 07:40.439
You'll swing with us
if that woman identifies you.

07:40.439 --> 07:43.233
- That's your problem.
- That's our problem.

07:43.233 --> 07:46.570
Then you take care of it.
Murder isn't part of our deal.

07:46.570 --> 07:51.241
Our deal was for you to see that our
arrangements are carried out smoothly.

07:51.241 --> 07:53.869
What's with you guys? I get you cars.

07:53.869 --> 07:58.040
I fix you up real nice here in my
warehouse. I even supply your fireworks.

07:58.040 --> 08:00.917
Now you want me to make a hit.

08:07.716 --> 08:10.302
Okay.

08:10.302 --> 08:13.763
I'll do it. But it's gonna cost you.

08:14.347 --> 08:16.850
Who are you kidding?

08:16.850 --> 08:19.769
You don't want my business,
shop someplace else.

08:19.769 --> 08:25.150
You should be flattered
I'm doing this for you personally.

08:29.696 --> 08:32.323
Very well.

08:33.616 --> 08:36.703
Nicole Carpenter. Attractive.

08:38.538 --> 08:41.750
All right. Make it clean.

08:41.916 --> 08:45.295
We don't need any more complications.

08:47.338 --> 08:49.299
He got my wallet and everything.

08:49.299 --> 08:53.219
Yes, officer. No, actually,
I got a very good look at him.

08:53.219 --> 08:58.308
Yes. Hey, stop that! Bad boy! I'm sorry,
I'm not talking to you, officer.

08:58.308 --> 09:02.520
I'm babysitting my neighbour's dog,
and he's driving me absolutely crazy.

09:02.520 --> 09:06.899
All the credit card notifications
have been made.

09:06.899 --> 09:10.862
The report?
I'm giving you the report now.

09:11.320 --> 09:14.866
Can't we just do this over the phone?

09:15.032 --> 09:19.454
No. Tonight? I can't tonight,
I've got to work in the morning.

09:19.454 --> 09:25.084
All right, all right, yes.
I'll be down there in 20 minutes.

09:45.604 --> 09:48.232
Come on, Bunky.

10:05.916 --> 10:08.502
Hey!

10:47.457 --> 10:50.043
Door's open.

10:53.839 --> 10:56.091
Hey.

10:56.091 --> 10:57.676
Come back here! Come on.

10:57.676 --> 11:01.054
Come on. Bunky, come on.

11:02.973 --> 11:06.935
Nikki, what's going on?
What are you doing here?

11:06.935 --> 11:11.314
Listen, I'm sorry
to drop in on you like this, but...

11:11.314 --> 11:12.816
I need to talk to you.

11:12.816 --> 11:15.485
You and me, talk?

11:15.652 --> 11:20.031
- I think somebody's trying to kill me.
- What?

11:21.032 --> 11:24.661
Well, for starters, I got mugged today.

11:25.453 --> 11:27.789
Mugged?

11:27.789 --> 11:32.877
Yeah. This guy comes flying
out of nowhere, knocks me down,

11:32.877 --> 11:37.173
grabs my wallet, jumps into
a getaway car, complete with driver.

11:37.173 --> 11:41.010
Tonight, I'm headed down to
the police station to fill out a report,

11:41.010 --> 11:43.471
and some maniac nearly runs me down.

11:43.471 --> 11:45.765
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

11:45.765 --> 11:50.854
Robbed, nearly flattened by some lunatic
driver. It's been a perfectly swell day.

11:50.854 --> 11:53.982
Yeah. Well, what'd the police say?

11:54.858 --> 11:56.401
What could they say?

11:56.401 --> 12:00.780
I gave them a description of the mugger,
what I could see of the car.

12:00.780 --> 12:02.907
There's not a heck of lot they can do.

12:02.907 --> 12:05.952
Well, we've all got enemies
in this business.

12:05.952 --> 12:09.122
Any heavyweights in your past
that could have done this?

12:09.122 --> 12:10.790
Well, sure.

12:10.790 --> 12:13.084
Tomorrow morning we should call Pete.

12:13.084 --> 12:15.503
He can run names in your personnel file.

12:15.503 --> 12:19.590
Kind of check on their whereabouts,
stuff like that.

12:19.590 --> 12:23.177
Oh, I don't want
to bother Pete about this.

12:23.177 --> 12:25.930
I mean, it's probably
a full moon or something.

12:25.930 --> 12:28.933
Or just plain old life in the big city.

12:28.933 --> 12:31.561
Look, let's just forget it.

12:32.186 --> 12:34.397
Bunky, come on. Bunky!

12:34.397 --> 12:35.773
That's it, boy.

12:35.773 --> 12:40.152
I'll call you in the morning.
Thanks, MacGyver.

12:47.660 --> 12:49.704
Look, I don't care how late it is.

12:49.704 --> 12:51.664
I want every scrap of information

12:51.664 --> 12:58.129
relating to that terrorist attack
on the cruise ship in the Mediterranean.

12:58.129 --> 13:02.716
Cross reference it and put a printout
on my desk before tomorrow morning.

13:02.716 --> 13:04.009
That's right.

13:04.009 --> 13:08.430
In case you're not aware, we're
operating in a crisis mode around here.

13:08.430 --> 13:10.057
- You all right?
- Yeah.

13:10.057 --> 13:13.602
- What's going on around here, Pete?
- Markus. Again.

13:13.602 --> 13:15.771
Markus?

13:15.771 --> 13:18.315
Didn't you help the Feds
nail him weeks ago?

13:18.315 --> 13:19.650
I did.

13:19.650 --> 13:23.821
Turns out he's got friends in town
laying down threats to get him released.

13:23.821 --> 13:27.282
- They blew the face off a post office.
- Anybody get hurt?

13:27.282 --> 13:29.076
No, fortunately.

13:29.076 --> 13:33.330
But now they're threatening to blow up
a whole city block by noon tomorrow

13:33.330 --> 13:37.418
if he's not released by 1 1.00
with a full press conference.

13:37.418 --> 13:40.462
- Anything I can do to help?
- Yes. Go home.

13:40.462 --> 13:44.716
Take care of that cold. I've got all
the help I need to chase down this lead.

13:44.716 --> 13:48.387
- Friend of Markus?
- Yeah, we got it from Interpol.

13:48.387 --> 13:50.681
Seems that Markus' number one man,

13:50.681 --> 13:55.185
somebody called Major, managed to slip
into the country with a bomb expert.

13:55.185 --> 13:59.648
Come on, Pete,
there's got to be something I can do.

13:59.648 --> 14:03.402
There is.
Go home and take care of the cold.

14:03.402 --> 14:06.863
- I don't need your help now.
- Okay. All right.

14:06.863 --> 14:09.783
But I do need yours.

14:09.950 --> 14:12.577
Pete...

14:12.577 --> 14:15.789
I need to look at Nikki's dossier.

14:16.873 --> 14:18.083
Why?

14:18.083 --> 14:22.462
Somebody snatched her wallet
and apparently tried to run her over.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.464
- Deliberately.
- Run her over?

14:24.464 --> 14:27.425
- Is she all right?
- Oh, yeah, she's fine.

14:27.425 --> 14:31.596
But apparently it rattled her enough
that she had to come see me.

14:31.596 --> 14:34.557
She started to ask for help,
and then backed off.

14:34.557 --> 14:40.605
- It wasn't something you said?
- No, I tried to be very helpful.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.818
Look, if somebody is after her,

14:44.984 --> 14:47.195
it could be somebody from her past.

14:47.195 --> 14:53.034
And the only way I can think of helping
is to look at her files.

14:53.034 --> 14:56.538
She's not gonna like it, you know that?

14:56.538 --> 14:58.289
You got a better suggestion?

14:58.289 --> 15:01.668
Oh, boy. You two amaze me,
you know that?

15:01.668 --> 15:04.587
She comes to you for help,
and then won't ask for it.

15:04.587 --> 15:07.966
Then you come to me to tell me
that you're worried about her.

15:07.966 --> 15:10.677
Did you think of having
a normal conversation?

15:10.677 --> 15:16.182
We'll have plenty to talk about
once I get this information.

15:16.182 --> 15:20.603
- Sure there's nothing I can do to help?
- Positive.

15:20.603 --> 15:23.231
Thornton.

15:23.314 --> 15:26.776
Really? All right, I'll be right down.

15:26.776 --> 15:29.320
That was the FBI.
They finally got a lead.

15:29.320 --> 15:33.825
It seems this guy, Major,
may have recruited some local talent.

15:33.825 --> 15:36.536
Oh, by the way,
that information is classified,

15:36.536 --> 15:39.247
- It doesn't leave this office.
- I know, Pete.

15:39.247 --> 15:43.501
And press the "clear" button
before you leave.

15:44.502 --> 15:47.088
Or die.

16:23.040 --> 16:26.168
Forget it, Bunky. I bathe alone.

16:44.394 --> 16:48.565
Give me a break, Bunky.
I've had a bad day.

17:01.995 --> 17:04.580
Bunky.

17:24.518 --> 17:27.854
Oh, great. The power's gone out.

17:40.784 --> 17:43.370
Bunky?

19:40.652 --> 19:43.238
Nikki?

19:44.490 --> 19:47.076
You all right?

19:47.409 --> 19:50.037
He would have killed me.

19:53.040 --> 19:55.626
You know what you need
is a good night's sleep.

19:55.626 --> 19:59.129
I can find a room someplace, you know.

20:00.005 --> 20:01.506
No.

20:01.506 --> 20:06.803
Until we get this thing figured out,
this is the safest place for you.

20:06.803 --> 20:10.641
That clown was no professional hit man,
that's for sure.

20:10.641 --> 20:12.351
Meaning?

20:12.351 --> 20:16.772
I don't think he was enough of a pro to
be connected to any of the five families

20:16.772 --> 20:21.109
you investigated while you
were with Senator Tagney.

20:21.109 --> 20:25.155
How did you know
about those investigations?

20:26.490 --> 20:29.117
You have read my file.

20:30.744 --> 20:33.371
Haven't you?

20:33.830 --> 20:36.416
Yeah. I had to.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.462
How dare you go digging
into my private life!

20:40.462 --> 20:44.257
Somebody is after you.
You came to me for help.

20:44.257 --> 20:47.177
Well, I don't need your help.

20:47.344 --> 20:50.513
I don't want you involved.
Do you understand me?

20:50.513 --> 20:53.099
I'll just handle this myself.

20:53.099 --> 20:56.061
Nobody gets close to Nikki
because she's jinxed.

20:56.061 --> 20:57.812
- Is that it?
- Let me out!

20:57.812 --> 21:00.273
You think my involvement
will get me killed

21:00.273 --> 21:04.360
- because it got your husband killed?
- Stop it!

21:04.360 --> 21:09.407
How much longer can you go on
telling people you're divorced?

21:09.407 --> 21:13.786
How much longer can you
go on blaming yourself?

21:15.205 --> 21:17.832
It was my fault.

21:18.708 --> 21:21.294
I should have known.

21:21.294 --> 21:25.882
It was a mob hit
and that car bomb was meant for me.

21:25.882 --> 21:30.136
Not him. Oh, God, not him.

21:36.976 --> 21:39.479
It's all right.

21:39.479 --> 21:42.106
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

21:44.066 --> 21:46.694
I'm sorry.

21:49.322 --> 21:51.949
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:59.206 --> 22:02.126
This place is a mess.
They haven't fixed the window.

22:02.126 --> 22:05.713
You get changed.
I'll take you back to the houseboat.

22:05.713 --> 22:09.091
I appreciate your help,
but it's me this maniac is after.

22:09.091 --> 22:12.386
I can't sit on my tail
and wait for you to solve the problem.

22:12.386 --> 22:16.307
You can keep your tail
from getting shot off.

22:16.307 --> 22:21.061
- Will you just let me handle it?
- How about "no"?

22:34.158 --> 22:38.454
You know, your place is a lot different
than I thought it would be.

22:38.454 --> 22:39.997
What were you expecting?

22:39.997 --> 22:42.499
I don't know, something a little...

22:42.499 --> 22:45.044
...fluffier, I guess.

22:45.044 --> 22:49.465
Fluffier? At least it isn't early
boy scout. Or should I say, wasn't?

22:49.465 --> 22:53.886
Not until that lunatic
showed up here last night.

22:53.886 --> 22:58.807
God, I hope I can get
that nightmare out of my mind.

23:04.479 --> 23:07.107
That's it, isn't it?

23:07.107 --> 23:10.277
That's what he
must have used last night.

23:10.277 --> 23:15.115
Yeah, probably. This is asbestos wire,
the kind they use for explosives.

23:15.115 --> 23:19.494
You don't pick this stuff up
at your local hardware store.

23:19.494 --> 23:21.663
What?

23:21.663 --> 23:23.832
Where were you mugged yesterday?

23:23.832 --> 23:26.126
Shopping area around Fifth and Town.

23:26.126 --> 23:28.378
- Near the post office?
- Yeah.

23:28.378 --> 23:30.255
That's where the bomb went off.

23:30.255 --> 23:32.841
- What bomb?
- Oh, it's been all over the news.

23:32.841 --> 23:36.386
It connects with the extradition
Pete worked on last month.

23:36.386 --> 23:39.097
- They want him released.
- You mean the Markus?

23:39.097 --> 23:41.933
The terrorist that
killed Americans on that ship?

23:41.933 --> 23:43.351
Yeah.

23:43.351 --> 23:48.064
It's possible the people trying
to spring him got your wallet yesterday.

23:48.064 --> 23:51.484
- Why?
- You got a good look at him?

23:53.069 --> 23:55.655
You could identify him?

23:56.906 --> 23:59.492
That's why. Get your coat.

24:01.870 --> 24:05.165
- Let's get on with this composite.
- Okay.

24:05.165 --> 24:09.169
- How's that for the eyes?
- Much narrower.

24:11.212 --> 24:13.256
- How's that?
- That's too narrow.

24:13.256 --> 24:15.842
Widen them up a bit.

24:18.595 --> 24:22.765
There. But somehow the nose doesn't
match quite right with those eyes.

24:22.765 --> 24:25.351
It was longer, I think.

24:26.227 --> 24:29.606
Longer. Was it flat, do you remember?

24:29.647 --> 24:32.233
It was more chiselled.

24:32.233 --> 24:34.861
Chiselled.

24:34.986 --> 24:37.947
There. That's it. That's him.

24:38.114 --> 24:40.742
Forensic team came up
with a lead on that wire.

24:40.742 --> 24:44.078
- They traced it already?
- Yeah, Webber Pyrotechnics.

24:44.078 --> 24:47.081
They reported a large
inventory loss two weeks ago.

24:47.081 --> 24:50.543
And the identification taggers
from the post office blast

24:50.543 --> 24:53.004
verify it's the same
batch of explosives.

24:53.004 --> 24:55.506
Those places are high security.

24:55.506 --> 25:00.261
They are. It's being investigated
as an inside job.

25:00.303 --> 25:03.306
- So is this our man?
- Pretty close.

25:03.306 --> 25:07.268
I'll put it into the system, see if we
can get him through Interpol files.

25:07.268 --> 25:14.400
We can check out the explosives plant.
Maybe somebody out there knows the guy.

25:31.500 --> 25:35.462
We can start with the personnel office.
Maybe the guy works here.

25:35.462 --> 25:37.965
- Don't bother.
- Why?

25:37.965 --> 25:39.508
That's him.

25:39.508 --> 25:42.094
The driver.

25:42.136 --> 25:45.055
Okay... let's take him.

25:45.222 --> 25:47.516
Wait! Wait.

25:47.516 --> 25:49.935
He'll get away.

25:49.935 --> 25:52.521
Well, that's the idea.

25:52.855 --> 25:55.441
Just wait here.

27:25.488 --> 27:27.574
This is the last time.

27:27.574 --> 27:30.910
- You don't like the deal?
- I don't like people getting hurt.

27:30.910 --> 27:33.705
- I read the papers.
- You're breaking my heart.

27:33.705 --> 27:35.873
This is your chance to take a stand.

27:35.873 --> 27:40.503
You don't want to do business with me,
don't take the money.

27:40.503 --> 27:42.213
Damn you.

27:42.213 --> 27:46.300
Your moral fibre's
an example to all of us.

28:27.758 --> 28:29.844
What was that all about?

28:29.844 --> 28:36.308
Well, we give him a head start,
and then follow the yellow brick road.

29:03.877 --> 29:08.298
...and a ten percent chance of rain.
That's it for KBLY news.

29:08.298 --> 29:10.884
So be it.

29:16.056 --> 29:19.059
Well? Was Markus on the news?

29:19.226 --> 29:20.686
Not a word.

29:20.686 --> 29:23.897
So they will hear from us at noon.

29:29.361 --> 29:32.155
Did you get those
blasting caps I asked for?

29:32.155 --> 29:34.199
I'll put them on your bill.

29:34.199 --> 29:36.576
The girl. You've taken care of that too?

29:36.576 --> 29:39.579
No problem.
She's singing with the angels.

29:39.579 --> 29:42.165
Good.

29:44.167 --> 29:46.753
You fool.

29:49.005 --> 29:52.092
- Look at this!
- What?

29:54.761 --> 29:57.639
- Where did it come from?
- Somebody's following.

29:57.639 --> 29:59.391
Well, then...

29:59.391 --> 30:02.269
...we shouldn't disappoint them.

30:03.103 --> 30:06.648
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving them a little surprise.

30:06.648 --> 30:09.275
You, Erik.

30:22.497 --> 30:26.876
It doesn't look like Emerald City,
but it's definitely the end of the line.

30:26.876 --> 30:29.462
Get me Pete, will you?

30:34.259 --> 30:37.262
- Yeah?
- We're down in the industrial area,

30:37.262 --> 30:39.097
just north of Boundary Road.

30:39.097 --> 30:41.557
The trail leads
to a warehouse down here.

30:41.557 --> 30:45.103
Okay, good work.
We've ID'd him as Erik Dunlap.

30:45.103 --> 30:48.606
He's the kind of lowlife
that Major would need to pull this off.

30:48.606 --> 30:50.817
I'll be down there soon, with backup.

30:50.817 --> 30:53.319
Right.

30:53.319 --> 30:56.739
I'm going in. Please, stay put.

33:40.318 --> 33:43.446
- He's dead?
- Nikki, get out of here.

33:43.446 --> 33:45.448
What is it?

33:45.448 --> 33:48.242
Explosives wired
to a weight displacement pad.

33:48.242 --> 33:52.246
- If I move, it blows.
- What are you going to do?

33:52.246 --> 33:54.832
I...

33:56.209 --> 33:59.670
If I can displace my weight
with something that weighs as much

33:59.670 --> 34:03.800
or more than I do,
I'll be able to step off this thing.

34:03.800 --> 34:06.010
I think.

34:06.010 --> 34:08.804
Now get out of here. Go.

36:14.971 --> 36:17.557
MacGyver?

36:26.107 --> 36:30.612
- Interesting way to travel.
- You had me scared to death.

36:30.612 --> 36:33.031
Are you all right?

36:33.031 --> 36:35.658
Yeah, I'm okay.

36:36.159 --> 36:38.786
Sure cleared the sinuses.

36:50.506 --> 36:53.134
Look familiar?

36:54.135 --> 36:57.513
- MacGyver, Nikki?
- Over here, Pete.

36:58.389 --> 37:01.017
Look at this.

37:02.268 --> 37:05.438
- What happened?
- They were expecting me.

37:05.438 --> 37:07.648
- You all right?
- Yeah, we're fine.

37:07.648 --> 37:09.942
The guy in there could use a coroner.

37:09.942 --> 37:11.986
Erik Dunlap.

37:11.986 --> 37:15.448
Markus is still behind bars,
so the bomb threat is on.

37:15.448 --> 37:19.494
Major is gonna blow
something up at high noon.

37:19.494 --> 37:22.330
- Pete?
- Yeah?

37:24.290 --> 37:28.920
- Is that the post office they blew up?
- Yes, it sure is.

37:28.920 --> 37:30.630
What about that?

37:30.630 --> 37:33.257
That's the Hall of Justice.

37:33.716 --> 37:38.220
- That could be their next target.
- That is in the middle of downtown!

37:38.220 --> 37:43.476
My God, that place is huge.
We may never find that bomb.

37:46.437 --> 37:49.523
I'd be willing to bet
they pieced together a mail truck.

37:49.523 --> 37:52.151
And turned it into a bomb.

37:52.818 --> 37:55.279
- Let's go. Officer?
- Yes?

37:55.279 --> 37:59.575
Put out a bulletin to evacuate the Hall
of Justice and surrounding buildings.

37:59.575 --> 38:02.620
Start surveillance on mail trucks.

38:14.631 --> 38:19.178
This is where we teach them
the meaning of compliance.

38:19.178 --> 38:21.764
Activate the bomb.

39:08.560 --> 39:11.146
Juice!

39:13.440 --> 39:16.067
Let's go.

39:23.074 --> 39:25.118
- Hold it!
- Freeze!

39:25.118 --> 39:27.620
Hit the sidewalk, now!

39:27.620 --> 39:31.958
You do what I say
or I'll put a hole in you!

40:09.996 --> 40:12.707
The bomb! How do you disarm it?

40:12.707 --> 40:16.043
You're too late.
Maybe next time you'll listen to us.

40:16.043 --> 40:18.171
I suggest we all get out of here.

40:18.171 --> 40:22.717
It's going to blow at noon.
Nothing can stop it.

40:25.928 --> 40:28.097
MacGyver!

40:28.097 --> 40:31.058
They say they can't turn it off.
Can you do anything?

40:31.058 --> 40:32.602
- No.
- No?

40:32.602 --> 40:35.396
- No!
- What do you mean, no?

40:35.438 --> 40:38.190
- Where's that bomb squad!
- It's too late.

40:38.190 --> 40:41.360
The whole truck's a bomb.
I've got to get it out of here.

40:41.360 --> 40:44.947
Well, you've got less than ten minutes.

40:45.072 --> 40:50.786
I've got to drive it off the Second
Street pier, that's our only chance.

40:50.786 --> 40:54.915
Second Street pier, run an escort.
Let's go!

41:16.687 --> 41:21.817
He's never gonna make it
to the harbour, it's too far.

41:43.297 --> 41:45.883
Come on!

41:57.394 --> 42:02.649
You've got less than five minutes left,
get out of here!

42:57.120 --> 43:00.081
I need you to fill that
mail truck with cement, fast!

43:00.081 --> 43:02.709
- What is this? You kidding?
- No, I'm not!

43:02.709 --> 43:04.586
There's a bomb in it!

43:04.586 --> 43:08.423
Caught your old lady taking a
special delivery from the mail man, huh?

43:08.423 --> 43:10.675
Nice touch. Very original.

43:10.675 --> 43:13.344
Please, will you just
move your truck forward

43:13.344 --> 43:16.556
and back it into the van
when I get behind you?

43:16.556 --> 43:20.810
- You're not kidding, are you?
- No, I'm not!

43:21.978 --> 43:25.148
Get people out of here,
there's a bomb in here.

43:25.148 --> 43:28.192
Get out of here, there's a bomb!

43:33.614 --> 43:36.826
There's a bomb! Clear out of here!

43:44.083 --> 43:46.669
Come on back.

43:50.881 --> 43:53.509
Come on, keep it coming.

43:59.890 --> 44:02.685
Come on. Keep it coming.

44:10.734 --> 44:13.362
Wait!

44:15.864 --> 44:18.450
Now get out of here!

45:01.118 --> 45:03.787
Ten, nine, eight,

45:03.954 --> 45:06.581
seven, six...

45:08.709 --> 45:11.336
...three...

45:20.387 --> 45:23.557
- It worked.
- It sure did.

45:24.307 --> 45:28.270
You could have been... What if
that cement truck hadn't been there?

45:28.270 --> 45:31.606
- I'd have gone to plan B.
- What was that?

45:31.606 --> 45:34.567
I don't know. Plan A worked.

45:43.076 --> 45:45.704
Sorry.
