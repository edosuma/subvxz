WEBVTT

00:00.668 --> 00:01.769
( Whistle blows )

00:01.835 --> 00:03.937
Donna,
we got to get going!

00:04.004 --> 00:06.774
Football's
about to start.

00:07.941 --> 00:10.644
They kick off,
our date night's gonna be...

00:10.711 --> 00:11.712
( Whistle blows )

00:11.779 --> 00:14.482
...you watching me
watching football.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.584
Donna: No!
Please don't start watching!

00:16.650 --> 00:18.786
I just need to finish
blow-drying my hair.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.988
Just stick your head
out of the window of the car.

00:21.055 --> 00:22.556
I'll drive fast.

00:24.292 --> 00:25.793
I'm -- I'm not
playing anymore.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.828
It's too dark.
I can't see the ball!

00:27.895 --> 00:29.397
Well, you can't catch it
in the daytime, either.

00:29.463 --> 00:30.531
What's
your excuse then?

00:30.598 --> 00:32.266
The sun's out
and I can see your face.

00:32.333 --> 00:33.634
Boom!

00:35.002 --> 00:36.470
Okay.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.240
Hey, guys. Here's money
for the kids for dinner.

00:39.307 --> 00:42.443
Uh, do not let them get into
anything they shouldn't.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.478
Oh, well, we were gonna
let them have a knife fight,

00:44.545 --> 00:46.280
but I guess
that's off the table now.

00:46.347 --> 00:47.981
Chale:
Don't worry, Mr. Gable.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.850
I was thinking
I could break out my guitar

00:49.917 --> 00:51.452
and we could all have
a sing-along --

00:51.519 --> 00:53.254
a little
"Chale Unplugged."

00:53.321 --> 00:54.322
( Chuckles )

00:54.388 --> 00:56.257
That'd be great.

00:56.324 --> 00:57.725
I-I -- by the way,
did Kendra ever tell you

00:57.791 --> 00:59.427
I was in a band
in college?

00:59.493 --> 01:00.794
No! Really?

01:00.861 --> 01:01.929
Yeah.

01:01.995 --> 01:03.197
The Pretend-To-Cares.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.599
Oh, wow.
That's catchy.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.401
Yeah,
our big song back then

01:07.468 --> 01:10.338
was "I Can't Believe
You're Buying It."

01:10.404 --> 01:11.872
Originally
by The Sarcastics.

01:11.939 --> 01:13.374
It was good.

01:15.643 --> 01:17.178
Ohhh.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.314
Hey! You said you were
gonna dress up a little.

01:20.381 --> 01:21.782
You're wearing jeans?

01:21.849 --> 01:23.083
They're stretchy jeans.

01:23.151 --> 01:25.919
I can move in these,
all right? I can do anything.

01:25.986 --> 01:27.788
No, come on.
Put on regular pants.

01:27.855 --> 01:29.357
No! What if someone
tries to rob us

01:29.423 --> 01:30.924
and I got to throw
a head kick?

01:30.991 --> 01:33.527
You'll snap your Achilles
and I'll hand him
all our money.

01:35.396 --> 01:36.397
( Rattle )
Oh.

01:36.464 --> 01:38.566
I-I-I got it.

01:38.632 --> 01:39.867
Ohhh!

01:43.171 --> 01:45.273
Stretchy jeans
working already.

01:45.339 --> 01:46.774
Look at that.

01:46.840 --> 01:51.779
* I am not your ordinary guy

01:51.845 --> 01:53.447
( Laughs )
Here you go, guys.

01:53.514 --> 01:54.682
A little dessert
on me.

01:54.748 --> 01:55.783
Oh!Oh!
Oh!Oh!

01:55.849 --> 01:57.050
Thank you, Enzo.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.919
Usually, you're a little tight
with the freebies.

01:58.986 --> 02:00.388
If you don't want them,
I'll take 'em back.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.722
No, no, no, no.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.591
Well, this is nice,
all of us getting together.

02:03.657 --> 02:04.692
Yeah.
Yeah.

02:04.758 --> 02:05.926
Obviously, Goody agrees.

02:05.993 --> 02:08.396
He's wearing his
sailboat-on-the-pocket shirt.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.231
All right.
Don't do it, guy.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.400
Lookit, the collar right there
says, "I'm all business."

02:12.466 --> 02:13.467
Then you float down
to the pocket,

02:13.534 --> 02:15.102
and it's like,
"But I can get loose.

02:15.169 --> 02:16.337
I can float on the seas."

02:16.404 --> 02:18.539
Says the guy
wearing maternity jeans.

02:18.606 --> 02:19.640
Oh!

02:19.707 --> 02:21.008
They're stretchy jeans,
all right?

02:21.074 --> 02:22.910
If I wanted to, I could
kick an olive off your head,

02:22.976 --> 02:24.178
and I'd have to tell you
I did it.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.313
( Chuckling ) Oh.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.215
Well,
I think you look great.
Thank you.

02:27.281 --> 02:29.016
What are you doing
with that cookie?

02:29.082 --> 02:31.352
You want to lose your foot
to diabetes, like your uncle?

02:32.886 --> 02:35.022
It's one little cookie.
Okay.

02:35.088 --> 02:37.358
But if you think I'm gonna
wheel you around the mall

02:37.425 --> 02:39.593
during my golden years,
you can think again.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.763
There you go, baby.

02:42.830 --> 02:46.133
Well, here's to finally
having our men home, safe,

02:46.200 --> 02:47.801
after 20 years
on the force.

02:47.868 --> 02:50.238
And to keeping them around
for a long time.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.439
Yes.
Yeah.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.573
With our feet.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.707
( Glasses clink )

02:53.774 --> 02:54.842
It was one dang cookie.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.510
Hey, isn't it your anniversary
this week?

02:56.577 --> 02:58.512
You better be doing
something good for my girl.

02:58.579 --> 02:59.747
Yeah, well,
he doesn't know it yet,

02:59.813 --> 03:01.349
but he is taking me
into the city

03:01.415 --> 03:03.317
to a great
Moroccan restaurant.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.118
Oh, yeah, the place
where you sit on the floor

03:05.185 --> 03:06.320
and eat with your hands?

03:06.387 --> 03:08.088
Yeah, I do that at home,
and she yells at me.

03:08.155 --> 03:10.324
And then we're going
to a Broadway musical.

03:10.391 --> 03:11.759
Wait, what?

03:11.825 --> 03:14.328
Yeah. The life story
of Gloria Estefan.
(E-STE-fan)

03:14.395 --> 03:15.863
I think it's "ES-te-fan."

03:15.929 --> 03:17.097
"E-STE-fan."

03:17.164 --> 03:18.832
I think it's "ES-te-fan."
Agree to disagree.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.167
I think
if you told the world,

03:20.234 --> 03:21.269
they'd be like,
"It's ES-te-fan."

03:21.335 --> 03:22.336
She's right.

03:22.403 --> 03:23.404
( Laughter )

03:23.471 --> 03:24.705
He chose last year,

03:24.772 --> 03:26.173
which meant we, uh,
ate cheesesteaks

03:26.240 --> 03:27.541
and watched "Rocky II."

03:27.608 --> 03:29.343
Yeah, at least my night had
a theme to it, all right?

03:29.410 --> 03:32.112
The mean streets
of Philadelphia.

03:32.179 --> 03:34.782
This one's got Moroccan food
and conga music.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.183
She's all over the map.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.818
Oh! Come on,
you big baby.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.653
We've had
worse anniversaries.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.154
Can't think of any.
( Chuckles )

03:41.221 --> 03:42.623
Uh, are you serious?

03:42.690 --> 03:45.293
How about six years ago,
when you almost died?

03:45.359 --> 03:47.295
Goody,
you know this story.

03:47.361 --> 03:48.396
I do?

03:48.462 --> 03:50.664
What happened?
I never heard this.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.099
I-I don't --
Nobody wants to go into it.

03:52.165 --> 03:53.667
Honey, nobody wants
to hear that story.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.636
Are you kidding me?!
No, no. It's stupid.
It doesn't matter.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.538
Scariest day of my life.
Can you stop?

03:57.605 --> 03:58.839
Okay, Kevin and Goody --
I --

03:58.906 --> 03:59.973
They went on a call

04:00.040 --> 04:01.742
where the guy robbed
a convenience store.

04:01.809 --> 04:04.177
So, they're chasing
after him...

04:04.244 --> 04:06.480
( Up-tempo rock music
playing )

04:08.282 --> 04:09.483
Aah!
Freeze!

04:12.986 --> 04:14.288
( Screams )

04:25.032 --> 04:28.336
Not on my anniversary,
dirtbag.

04:28.402 --> 04:31.739
So, Kevin gets up to the roof,
but -- poof!

04:31.805 --> 04:33.240
The guy is gone.

04:33.307 --> 04:34.608
He goes to check
the fire escape,

04:34.675 --> 04:36.810
turns around, and the guy
is right behind him.

04:36.877 --> 04:37.945
No!
Yes!

04:38.011 --> 04:40.981
And he pushes Kevin
off the roof!

04:41.048 --> 04:43.250
But he catches himself.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.453
( Grunts )

04:46.920 --> 04:49.289
( Scream echoing )

04:50.190 --> 04:51.992
Aah!

04:52.059 --> 04:53.861
You okay?

04:53.927 --> 04:55.496
Yeah.

04:55.563 --> 04:57.431
I'm all right.

04:57.498 --> 05:00.868
I'm a cop.
It comes with the territory.

05:02.169 --> 05:04.237
It was a miracle.

05:04.304 --> 05:07.941
The Dumpster was supposed to
have been emptied that day.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.977
Okay.
If it had been...

05:10.043 --> 05:12.045
( Voice breaking )
he wouldn't be here today.

05:12.112 --> 05:14.114
That's unbelievable.
Yeah.

05:14.181 --> 05:16.116
That is unbelievable.

05:18.251 --> 05:19.553
Hold up.

05:19.620 --> 05:22.423
What took you so long
to get there?

05:22.490 --> 05:23.724
I don't remember.

05:23.791 --> 05:25.459
What did take me
so long?

05:27.461 --> 05:29.196
It was, uh...

05:29.262 --> 05:30.898
He stopped for a churro.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.769
You stopped
for a churro?

05:36.870 --> 05:38.606
I guess I did.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.509
You know, uh, but h-he
definitely got involved.

05:41.575 --> 05:44.945
I mean, h-he called for backup
and stuff like that, so...
Oh. Yeah.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.814
Yeah, you know what?
I'm, uh...

05:46.880 --> 05:48.416
I'm just gonna hit
the bathroom for a second.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.183
Me too.
Oh, great.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.088
( Sighs )

05:55.155 --> 05:56.223
I-I can explain.

05:56.289 --> 05:57.324
Yeah, so can I!

05:57.391 --> 05:59.259
You stole my story!

05:59.326 --> 06:02.129
The chase, the fall?
That happened to me!

06:02.195 --> 06:04.197
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

06:04.264 --> 06:06.500
It was my anniversary,
and I totally forgot!

06:06.567 --> 06:09.302
I came home, Donna had a card
and a gift for me.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.971
I had nothing!
( Scoffs )

06:11.038 --> 06:12.272
My only way out
was your story.

06:12.339 --> 06:13.507
It worked great,
by the way.

06:13.574 --> 06:16.309
Man, I don't care!
That's no excuse!

06:16.376 --> 06:19.547
And why in blue hell
did you have me eat a churro?

06:19.613 --> 06:21.782
Again, I panicked.

06:21.849 --> 06:24.284
Look, what I did
is indefensible,

06:24.351 --> 06:26.353
but in my defense...

06:26.420 --> 06:28.155
you told me that you couldn't
tell Didi the story

06:28.221 --> 06:30.023
'cause she'd freak out
and make you quit the force.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.493
Well, that doesn't mean
that you can use it.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.161
I-I don't know
how you sleep at night.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.963
Not good.

06:36.029 --> 06:38.165
Part of it's this,
but most of it's sleep apnea.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.767
You know
what I'm talking about?

06:39.833 --> 06:41.034
How about this?
Look.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.335
How about you take
one of my cool stories?

06:42.402 --> 06:44.037
I got plenty of them.
Like what?

06:44.104 --> 06:45.773
How about that time
I climbed down into the sewer

06:45.839 --> 06:48.576
and I pulled out
those -- those baby ducks?

06:48.642 --> 06:49.877
They were raccoons.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.912
Are you sure?
Yeah.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.914
Because that was me,
too.

06:56.149 --> 07:00.320
Oh, here they come --
Super Cop and Captain Cupcake.

07:02.490 --> 07:05.493
**

07:08.762 --> 07:10.397
**

07:10.464 --> 07:12.432
Hey, did you, uh --
did you call Goody?

07:12.500 --> 07:14.602
Yeah.
He ain't showing.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.169
You made him
look like an idiot.

07:16.236 --> 07:19.439
Let's see how he feels after
he gets these Omaha Steaks.

07:19.507 --> 07:21.809
You really think steaks
are gonna fix this?

07:21.875 --> 07:23.176
No.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.312
That's why I also got him
"Despicable Me" on Blu-ray.

07:25.378 --> 07:28.415
Those Minions, man.
( Chuckles )

07:28.482 --> 07:31.018
They just don't listen.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.486
Kyle: Why didn't you
get him lobster?

07:32.553 --> 07:34.988
Although, it might make you
look a little "shellfish."

07:35.055 --> 07:36.690
( Laughs )

07:36.757 --> 07:37.825
"Shellfish."

07:37.891 --> 07:39.459
( Chuckles )

07:39.527 --> 07:41.729
See?
Mott gets it.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.665
No, I'm still thinking
about those Minions.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.467
What about Rollerblades?

07:47.535 --> 07:50.538
That says, uh,
"Let's roll past this."

07:50.604 --> 07:53.373
Listen, the real question is,
what are you gonna get Donna?

07:53.440 --> 07:55.943
I'm gonna get her the gift
of not knowing the truth.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.311
I mean, she finds out now,
she'll just get hurt.

07:58.378 --> 07:59.713
What if Goody tells her?

07:59.780 --> 08:00.948
Hey!
Whoa!

08:01.014 --> 08:02.382
Whoa. Hey.
Whoa.

08:02.449 --> 08:04.284
Guy, look, I don't know what
you do down at the firehouse,

08:04.351 --> 08:06.920
but cops --
we don't sing.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.889
I don't know, though, man.
That Didi is tough.

08:08.956 --> 08:10.524
If she cranks up the kettle
on Goody,

08:10.591 --> 08:13.527
he could sing
like Michael Buble.

08:14.895 --> 08:17.297
Oh, wow.
Then Didi tells Donna.

08:17.364 --> 08:18.632
Man, I got to
get ahead of this.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.934
Yeah, and I'm telling you,
the best way to do that --

08:21.001 --> 08:23.203
Rollerblades.

08:24.271 --> 08:27.941
**

08:28.008 --> 08:30.243
Hey, when we get married,
how many kids do you want?

08:30.310 --> 08:31.912
( Chuckles )
I don't know.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.180
How many do you want?

08:33.246 --> 08:34.715
No, come on.
Seriously.

08:34.782 --> 08:35.916
How many?

08:35.983 --> 08:37.551
Okay, okay.
Let's say it at the same time.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.019
( Chuckles )
Okay.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.120
Go.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.288
One.
Five.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.958
...to five, si--
so many children from you.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.660
Aww.
( Giggles )

08:46.727 --> 08:48.195
Hey, guys.

08:48.261 --> 08:49.597
Where's, uh, Mom?
I got to talk to her.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.098
Uh, in the kitchen
with Goody's wife.

08:51.164 --> 08:52.299
Okay.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.034
She what?

08:54.101 --> 08:55.235
What's she doing
in there?

08:55.302 --> 08:57.771
Uh, they're talking.
Why?

08:57.838 --> 08:59.907
Okay, um...
I'm gonna run to the store.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.474
Anybody need something
from Jersey?

09:02.910 --> 09:05.012
Donna:
Honey, is that you?

09:05.078 --> 09:07.581
Y-Yeah.

09:07.648 --> 09:08.682
Can you please
come in here?

09:08.749 --> 09:10.718
Yeah, I'm just gonna
come in there.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.119
( Keys jingle )

09:12.185 --> 09:14.087
Sweetheart, I love you.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.555
Chale...

09:15.623 --> 09:16.657
( Whimpers )

09:18.291 --> 09:20.160
Hello, ladies.
Hi.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.062
What it be?

09:22.129 --> 09:25.332
Oh, we were just talking
about...the story.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.335
Yeah. I mean,
that was just a crazy day.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.837
I mean,
it -- it was really a blur.

09:29.903 --> 09:33.240
I mean, memories --
they're weird, you know?

09:33.306 --> 09:34.474
Oh, come on.

09:34.541 --> 09:36.076
You have
an inspirational story.
Yeah.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.445
Would you come and talk
to my class of fourth-graders?

09:38.511 --> 09:39.680
They need a role model.

09:39.747 --> 09:42.582
I, uh...no, I wouldn't do it,
but, you know...

09:42.650 --> 09:44.384
You know who's a great
role model, is Goody.

09:44.451 --> 09:45.585
Did you guys
ever hear that story

09:45.653 --> 09:48.521
about him saving
those baby raccoons?

09:48.588 --> 09:49.757
What's he gonna talk about?

09:49.823 --> 09:53.093
How to find a Danish
in an abandoned building?

09:53.160 --> 09:54.261
Y-You know what it is?

09:54.327 --> 09:55.863
I-I just got to tell you.
I'm -- ( Sighs )

09:55.929 --> 09:57.765
I'm a little shy.
Shy?!

09:57.831 --> 09:59.967
You've been banned
from three karaoke bars

10:00.033 --> 10:01.401
for hogging the mic.

10:01.468 --> 10:03.370
Babe, we get it --
You like Lionel Richie.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.905
Okay,
t-that is not true.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.539
I am back in
at J.T. O'Tooles.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.941
Really?
Yeah.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.576
And believe me, people will be
dancing on the ceiling.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.313
But, babe, I already
told Didi you'd do it.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.715
Come on.
Do it for the kids.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.650
I-I would. I really want
to do it for the kids.

10:16.717 --> 10:19.152
It's just that I'm not great
in a classroom situation.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.253
Oh, it's perfect!

10:20.320 --> 10:21.889
It's a P.E. class.
We'll be outside.

10:21.955 --> 10:22.990
Oh, really?
Yeah.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.591
I can't do that,
but...

10:24.658 --> 10:27.394
how would your kids feel
about Omaha Steaks?

10:27.460 --> 10:31.899
**

10:31.965 --> 10:33.033
Wow.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.234
Okay.

10:34.301 --> 10:37.237
That was a tsunami
of lies and deception.

10:37.304 --> 10:40.273
Well, if I'm coming in here,
I'm getting my money's worth.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.474
( Chuckles )

10:42.910 --> 10:45.512
Sorry, Father Philip.
You were saying?

10:45.578 --> 10:46.714
It seems
pretty cut-and-dry.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.048
You need
to stop the lying,

10:48.115 --> 10:49.516
and then you come clean
with everything else.

10:49.582 --> 10:50.650
Okay.

10:50.718 --> 10:53.286
Or hear me out
on this one.

10:54.922 --> 10:57.457
I tell the story one more time
to the kids

10:57.524 --> 11:00.127
'cause they don't know
it's not my story, right?

11:00.193 --> 11:03.731
And they get inspired.

11:03.797 --> 11:06.666
I like that.
Right?

11:06.734 --> 11:09.602
And meanwhile, Goody gets
the steaks and the Minions.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.905
Love that movie.
Right?

11:11.972 --> 11:14.574
And best of all,
Donna never gets hurt,

11:14.641 --> 11:15.909
and we have
a great anniversary.

11:15.976 --> 11:18.245
This sound exciting.

11:18.311 --> 11:19.579
Mm-hmm.

11:19.646 --> 11:22.249
But after that, you never
tell the lie again, right?

11:22.315 --> 11:24.351
Absolutely. I shut that baby
down right there.

11:24.417 --> 11:25.518
You know?

11:25.585 --> 11:26.787
This is just all
for the greater good,

11:26.854 --> 11:27.921
if you want
to do the math.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.489
No, I --
I've done the math.

11:29.556 --> 11:32.259
It sounds like you have
great intentions here.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.127
Well, thanks for
picking up on that.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.464
Much like the ones
that paved the road to Hell!

11:45.272 --> 11:47.507
Wow, this took a turn.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.178
Here's the deal.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.813
You're not
talking to the kids.

11:52.880 --> 11:53.881
Okay.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.648
You can't tell the lie
anymore.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.984
Gotcha.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.620
And if you wrong someone,
you need to make it right.

12:00.687 --> 12:02.890
Understand?

12:02.956 --> 12:05.158
Yeah. I know
what I got to do.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.828
By the way, J-E-T-S.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.830
( Whispering )
Jets, Jets, Jets!

12:11.064 --> 12:13.166
So, you're all good.
I took care of it.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.868
What do you mean,
you took care of it?

12:14.935 --> 12:15.936
I told Didi.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.805
Wh-- You told my wife?!

12:17.871 --> 12:20.540
Well, I can't tell Donna.
Today's our anniversary!

12:20.607 --> 12:21.674
Hey, congrats!

12:21.741 --> 12:23.043
Thanks, man.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.211
You're killing me,
man.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.979
I told you
I did not want her to know!

12:26.046 --> 12:27.214
Oh, this is not good.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.950
( Scoffs )
I made you the hero!

12:30.017 --> 12:31.351
You're -- you're not
on the force anymore.

12:31.418 --> 12:32.552
She can't make you quit!

12:32.619 --> 12:34.487
I-I can't believe this.

12:34.554 --> 12:35.555
Well, what did she say?

12:35.622 --> 12:37.090
Nothing.
I left her a message.

12:37.157 --> 12:39.492
Texting her seemed
kind of cold,
so I didn't feel like --

12:39.559 --> 12:40.928
No, no, no.
You don't understand.

12:40.994 --> 12:43.230
She has
massive trust issues!

12:43.296 --> 12:45.799
No lies --
anytime, about anything!

12:45.866 --> 12:48.068
Ugh.
Man, you just
ruined my life.

12:48.135 --> 12:51.771
Oh, dial down the drama,
Denzel.

12:51.839 --> 12:54.341
( Vehicle approaches )

12:54.407 --> 12:55.943
Goody,
your wife just pulled up.

12:56.009 --> 12:58.111
Oh, man.
This is gonna suck.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.212
Ohh.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.780
This is why

13:00.848 --> 13:04.751
you're supposed to
always turn off
your location settings.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.253
You're gonna be fine.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.321
Didi:
Tyrone Cesar Goodman!

13:08.388 --> 13:09.422
Cesar?
Cesar?

13:09.489 --> 13:10.590
Cesar?

13:10.657 --> 13:12.325
Didi. Looking good.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.794
I got a mirror.

13:14.862 --> 13:17.797
You -- in the car.
We will talk
about this at home.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.499
But I drove here.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.734
Well,
I'll figure it out.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.938
( Sighs )
Listen, uh...

13:25.005 --> 13:26.473
go easy on him.

13:26.539 --> 13:27.875
I mean,
underneath all the lies,

13:27.941 --> 13:30.510
you got yourself
a good man there.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.279
But I don't need
to tell you that.
You married him.

13:32.345 --> 13:33.613
( Chuckles )

13:33.680 --> 13:35.983
That makes you good --
by marriage. ( Chuckles )

13:36.049 --> 13:37.717
We got to get another
couples night on the books --

13:37.784 --> 13:39.953
You need to shut up.
Yep.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.955
And don't tell me
how good my man is.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.790
I know how good he is.

13:43.857 --> 13:45.058
And you --

13:45.125 --> 13:47.760
I know you're lying
'cause your lips are moving.

13:47.827 --> 13:48.962
Don't make that face at me.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.031
I'm sorry. It just pops out
when I'm scared.

13:51.098 --> 13:52.699
Yeah.
You should be.

13:52.765 --> 13:54.567
What does your wife
have to say about this?

13:54.634 --> 13:56.469
I bet she has an opinion.

13:57.905 --> 13:59.606
You haven't told her,
have you?

13:59.672 --> 14:01.274
Unbelievable!

14:01.341 --> 14:03.576
You need to put on
your big-boy pants

14:03.643 --> 14:04.912
and make things right.

14:06.113 --> 14:08.515
Y'all don't deserve
this pizza.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.383
Hey!
Hey!

14:10.450 --> 14:11.484
Hey!

14:15.388 --> 14:17.324
I'm serious.
You were on fire tonight.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.960
Yeah, well,
Gloria Estefan is right.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.995
The rhythm
is gonna get you.
( Laughs )

14:22.062 --> 14:23.663
But, I mean,
the whole night.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.632
I mean, you didn't complain
at the Moroccan restaurant.
Mm-hmm.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.300
You enjoyed the show.
Yeah.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.970
It was a great anniversary,
huh?
It was.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.972
So, hero, you want
to take this upstairs?

14:32.039 --> 14:33.673
Oh! Oh!

14:33.740 --> 14:35.675
I like it!
I like it!

14:35.742 --> 14:37.344
I probably should tell you
something first, though.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.646
Ohh!
Something good?

14:39.712 --> 14:41.114
Is the evening
gonna get even better?

14:41.181 --> 14:42.415
Oh!
Better or worse.

14:42.482 --> 14:43.750
Either way, it's gonna spike
one way or the other.

14:43.816 --> 14:44.851
( Laughs )

14:44.918 --> 14:46.153
Okay.
( Chuckles )

14:46.219 --> 14:48.388
Yeah, um, it's just about
that story that I told you,

14:48.455 --> 14:49.556
where I fell off the roof.

14:49.622 --> 14:50.890
Yeah?
Um...

14:50.958 --> 14:52.592
I might have told it to you
a little different

14:52.659 --> 14:53.860
than it actually happened.

14:53.927 --> 14:54.962
What do you mean?

14:55.028 --> 14:56.596
No, I mean,
Goody and I

14:56.663 --> 14:58.298
were definitely
chasing a guy.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.506
( Clatter )

15:19.819 --> 15:22.522
( Straining )

15:32.899 --> 15:35.268
So, Goody
fell off the roof.

15:35.335 --> 15:36.869
Yes.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.705
Were you even there?

15:38.771 --> 15:40.507
Oh, I was there.

15:40.573 --> 15:43.443
( Siren wailing,
police radio chatter )

15:43.510 --> 15:44.544
You all right?

15:44.611 --> 15:45.678
Yeah.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.614
Yeah, just got hung up here.
( Chuckles )

15:47.680 --> 15:50.650
The, uh, hips are going
a little numb.

15:50.717 --> 15:51.751
Did you fall off a roof?

15:51.818 --> 15:53.320
Oh, yeah.
It was crazy, man.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.088
Luckily,
I landed on trash bags.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.756
I was this close
to dying.

15:56.823 --> 15:57.890
Yeah.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.859
My belt's stuck.
Oh.

15:59.926 --> 16:00.927
Well, l-listen.

16:00.994 --> 16:02.362
Didi can never
find out about this,

16:02.429 --> 16:03.730
or she'll make me
quit the force.

16:03.796 --> 16:04.964
I got you.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.433
This'll go to the grave
with us.
Yeah.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.001
By the way, will you hurry up
and get me down?

16:08.068 --> 16:09.569
'Cause the pressure's
building behind my eyes.

16:09.636 --> 16:10.837
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh!

16:10.903 --> 16:13.306
It's your handcuffs, man.
You arrested a fence.

16:13.373 --> 16:14.441
Oh, okay.
( Chuckles )

16:14.507 --> 16:15.542
( Fence rattles )
Get me down.

16:15.608 --> 16:16.643
Ow!
You're pinching me!

16:16.709 --> 16:17.744
Oh, sorry!
You're pinching!

16:17.810 --> 16:18.845
So,
that's the real story.

16:18.911 --> 16:20.613
But the good news is,

16:20.680 --> 16:23.416
Goody and I,
we -- we made it.

16:23.483 --> 16:24.617
( Chuckles )

16:24.684 --> 16:25.718
Bring it in.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.688
No, no, no, no.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.857
( Scoffs )
I should have guessed.

16:30.923 --> 16:32.792
I mean,
jumping over fences?

16:32.859 --> 16:34.494
You can't even
get out of a hammock.

16:34.561 --> 16:36.529
Well...

16:36.596 --> 16:38.131
Who can, really?

16:38.198 --> 16:39.332
Honestly,
you get one cheek off,

16:39.399 --> 16:41.134
and then you flip like
a fried egg. I mean --

16:41.201 --> 16:43.303
Come on!

16:43.370 --> 16:45.505
Why would you do that?

16:45.572 --> 16:47.974
( Sighs ) 'Cause I forgot
our anniversary.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.042
( Scoffs ) Wow.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.377
And what did you think
I was gonna do

16:50.443 --> 16:51.644
that was so terrible

16:51.711 --> 16:53.713
to make you continue
to lie to me for six years?

16:53.780 --> 16:56.749
I only lied once.
It just...lived for six years.

16:56.816 --> 16:59.552
Believe me,
I tried to bury it.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.254
Bury it?

17:01.321 --> 17:04.023
Last month, you wouldn't go to
my vice principal's barbecue

17:04.091 --> 17:07.594
because you said
they live too close
to where it happened.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.162
The guy freaks me out!

17:09.229 --> 17:10.497
He eats corn on the cob

17:10.563 --> 17:14.334
and he stares at you like,
"After this, you're next."

17:14.401 --> 17:16.903
Yeah, he's awkward,
but he's my boss.

17:16.969 --> 17:19.172
Look, I'm -- I'm sorry.
Okay?

17:19.239 --> 17:21.308
Well, you should be.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.642
We're good now, right?

17:22.709 --> 17:26.746
I mean, I'm still mad at you,
but we will be good.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.581
Just don't lie to me,
you know?

17:28.648 --> 17:30.450
I mean,
I'm not perfect, either.

17:30.517 --> 17:33.320
You know, in 2007,
I forgot our anniversary.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.188
Really?
I -- I don't remember that.

17:35.255 --> 17:36.823
Yeah,
because you also forgot.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.459
We both forgot.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.661
We didn't celebrate
our anniversary for two years.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.396
Wow, that hurts.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.632
I guess that makes us even,
though.

17:45.698 --> 17:48.135
Not a chance, no.
You owe me big-time.

17:48.201 --> 17:51.104
But come on.
Let's get ready for bed.

17:51.171 --> 17:54.006
That's the beauty
of stretchy pants.
I'm always ready.

17:56.343 --> 17:59.346
**

17:59.412 --> 18:03.250
( Munching )

18:13.293 --> 18:16.028
Love what you've done
with the backyard, Larry.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.130
Um...

18:17.197 --> 18:19.065
Hey, what kind of tree
is that?

18:19.132 --> 18:21.768
Dutch Elm.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.603
( Munching )

18:25.605 --> 18:27.340
You hear that, honey?
It's a Dutch Elm.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.742
That's your, uh --
your favorite kind of tree.

18:32.679 --> 18:35.482
What's
your second favorite?

18:35.548 --> 18:38.084
Oh, wow, that's tough.
It's, um...

18:38.151 --> 18:41.087
Maples are...cool.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.825
You know, Larry,
I-I got to be honest. Um...

18:45.892 --> 18:48.428
( Loud crunch )

18:48.495 --> 18:50.330
My husband,
six years ago,

18:50.397 --> 18:52.599
fell off a roof
in the line of duty,

18:52.665 --> 18:55.768
and he has
some anxiety issues.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.970
It's true. And you know what?
I forgot my meds.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.306
You did!
So we got to go.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.174
Oh. Sorry.
Sorry.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.509
Okay.
Yeah, okay.

19:04.110 --> 19:06.145
**

19:09.349 --> 19:11.884
First, I just want to say
that we're really glad

19:11.951 --> 19:13.052
we're all doing this,

19:13.119 --> 19:16.389
and the both of us
are really sorry, so...

19:16.456 --> 19:18.425
"The both of us"?

19:19.592 --> 19:21.594
Yeah, you're always
saying we're a team.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.829
Boy, those days
are over, huh?

19:22.895 --> 19:24.331
Okay.

19:24.397 --> 19:27.500
I'm really sorry
to all of you, all right?

19:27.567 --> 19:28.701
And to make it up,

19:28.768 --> 19:31.338
I made you
this very healthy meal.

19:31.404 --> 19:35.475
It's gluten-free pasta and
it's low-sugar sauce, so...

19:35.542 --> 19:37.677
let's enjoy, you know?

19:37.744 --> 19:39.412
Mmm.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.032
Enzo's?

20:00.099 --> 20:01.534
Yeah. Let's go.
Uh-huh.

20:01.601 --> 20:04.904
**

20:04.971 --> 20:08.275
* Don't want
no sweet perfume *

20:08.341 --> 20:11.811
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move *

20:11.878 --> 20:14.013
* Do, do, do, do, do

20:14.080 --> 20:15.548
* Do, do, do, do

20:15.615 --> 20:19.151
* Ohhhhhh, yeah

20:19.218 --> 20:22.221
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes *

20:22.289 --> 20:24.924
* I just don't want no...
