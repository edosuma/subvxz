WEBVTT

00:06.658 --> 00:08.051
I've been thinking...

00:08.095 --> 00:09.922
-Ugh.
-No.
-Again?
-No!

00:09.966 --> 00:12.403
<i>Previously on
"Kevin Can Himself"...</i>

00:14.840 --> 00:16.233
No!

00:16.277 --> 00:18.409
If I could start over,
and go somewhere else...

00:18.453 --> 00:19.932
Sam.

00:19.976 --> 00:21.195
So, what did I miss
the last 15 years?

00:21.238 --> 00:22.544
What's this?

00:22.587 --> 00:24.633
We're moving.

00:24.676 --> 00:26.765
Wake the hell up.
The account's empty.

00:26.809 --> 00:29.072
We decided
we're staying.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.334
We did?

00:41.476 --> 00:44.087
So, this is, what?
Seven days in a row?

00:44.131 --> 00:47.047
You're sweet to notice.

00:47.090 --> 00:48.961
It's my new ritual.

00:49.005 --> 00:51.486
A scone, a book,
and some peace.

00:51.529 --> 00:52.922
Are you new to town?

00:52.965 --> 00:54.924
No.
Lived here all my life,

00:54.967 --> 00:57.796
but I just never had
any time for myself.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.798
But since
my husband passed...

00:59.842 --> 01:02.366
Oh, I didn't realize.

01:02.410 --> 01:04.151
I'm a widow.

01:04.194 --> 01:06.109
How'd that happen?

01:06.153 --> 01:07.154
Oh, I killed him.

01:10.331 --> 01:11.593
Oh.

01:11.636 --> 01:13.116
Good for you, honey.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.379
It's gotta be tough
not getting caught.

01:15.423 --> 01:16.902
How'd you do it?

01:22.038 --> 01:25.476
I don't know
how I did it.

01:35.834 --> 01:36.792
What the hell
is happening?!

01:36.835 --> 01:39.142
It's Belichick Hoodie Day!

01:39.186 --> 01:42.014
-What?!
-It's Belichick Hoodie Day!

01:44.843 --> 01:46.018
Oh, no.

01:46.062 --> 01:48.804
You okay, babe?

01:48.847 --> 01:50.501
Definitely concussed.

01:50.545 --> 01:52.808
And any other day,
that'd bother me.

01:52.851 --> 01:55.027
But not today!

01:55.071 --> 01:58.205
Don't you wanna
ask me why?

01:58.248 --> 02:01.033
Wh--
Because my genuine
Bill Belichick sweatshirt --

02:01.077 --> 02:03.166
cut at the sleeves
like a boss

02:03.210 --> 02:05.168
and worn to at least two
Pats games --

02:05.212 --> 02:07.388
is arriving today!

02:07.431 --> 02:10.782
And, uh, how much you pay
for a torn hoodie?

02:10.826 --> 02:12.871
I cannot and will not
put a price

02:12.915 --> 02:16.005
on what the greatest coach
of all time means to me.

02:16.048 --> 02:19.835
Okay, well, what price did
the Internet put on it?

02:19.878 --> 02:23.752
More than our wedding,
less than our car.

02:23.795 --> 02:27.016
Oh! I was having
the nicest dream.

02:27.059 --> 02:28.974
Come on!
You can sleep anytime!

02:29.018 --> 02:32.108
This is like
Christmas morning!

02:32.152 --> 02:33.849
Okay, well, then,
where's my present?

02:33.892 --> 02:35.416
Your present?

02:35.459 --> 02:39.028
Well, I'm the gift
that keeps on giving, baby!

02:39.071 --> 02:41.857
Belichick Hoodie Day!

03:06.011 --> 03:06.969
I killed him.

03:46.661 --> 03:50.317
Hey.

03:52.971 --> 03:57.324
It's, uh --
It's Bill Belichick Hoodie Day.

03:57.367 --> 03:59.108
Oh, yes.

03:59.151 --> 04:00.849
But I celebrate
privately.

04:05.506 --> 04:07.421
Well, have a good one.

04:19.128 --> 04:20.651
Hey,
where's our breakfast?

04:20.695 --> 04:22.697
You're not supposed
to have favorites.

04:22.740 --> 04:24.176
Kevin's my husband.

04:24.220 --> 04:26.570
Yeah, Neil,
breakfast is for family.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.659
See, Kevin's the husband,
I'm the father-in-law.

04:28.703 --> 04:29.791
Yeah,
and I'm like a brother.

04:29.834 --> 04:31.314
No, you're more like
a cousin

04:31.358 --> 04:34.317
who just got out of jail
for stalking.

04:34.361 --> 04:36.972
And everyone's secretly kind of
hoping he goes back.

04:37.015 --> 04:39.191
How is Keith?
Bad.

04:39.235 --> 04:40.715
Hey, babe?

04:40.758 --> 04:42.020
Can you go see
if my package is here yet?

04:42.064 --> 04:43.239
Can't you do it?

04:43.283 --> 04:46.373
I'm in the middle
of something.

04:46.416 --> 04:49.593
Aw, man, I really need
this hoodie.

04:49.637 --> 04:51.682
The old self-esteem took
a real hit this week

04:51.726 --> 04:54.555
when the camera
on my phone flipped to face me.

04:54.598 --> 04:56.208
So many chins.

04:56.252 --> 04:59.211
That's just baby fat,
bro.

04:59.255 --> 05:01.475
Thanks, brother.

05:01.518 --> 05:05.217
Well, I checked,
and no package yet.

05:05.261 --> 05:07.655
Ugh!
This is taking forever!

05:07.698 --> 05:10.788
What sins did I commit
in a past life to deserve this?

05:10.832 --> 05:12.703
Past life?

05:12.747 --> 05:17.012
Hon, you know what happens
when you try to be funny.

05:17.055 --> 05:20.929
Kev, I think I hear a delivery
truck coming down the street.

05:20.972 --> 05:22.713
Now he can get up.

05:22.757 --> 05:24.933
Aw, man,
it's just an ambulance!

05:24.976 --> 05:26.630
-On our street?
-Please don't be for me.

05:26.674 --> 05:29.894
Please don't be for me.

05:29.938 --> 05:32.854
Hey, the new neighbors
have packages on their stoop.

05:32.897 --> 05:34.377
What gives?

05:34.421 --> 05:36.031
I saw her moving in,
and I am not a fan.

05:36.074 --> 05:37.946
Bad vibes there, bro.

05:37.989 --> 05:39.251
Ooh, bad neighbors.

05:39.295 --> 05:42.254
What would that be like?

05:42.298 --> 05:43.908
You trying to
be funny again?

05:43.952 --> 05:45.823
No.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.564
Good.

05:47.608 --> 05:49.392
And Neil's
probably right.

05:51.307 --> 05:53.091
I went over there
to be neighborly.

05:53.135 --> 05:54.397
Uh-huh.
You know, make sure
they know

05:54.441 --> 05:56.660
who's the alpha
on the street.

05:56.704 --> 05:59.707
Hope you also told 'em
who's the beta.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.012
And you know what they said
when I asked them

06:01.056 --> 06:03.058
what their
favorite football team was?

06:03.101 --> 06:04.276
Manchester United.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.756
Boo!
Hiss!

06:05.800 --> 06:08.455
-Football is football.
-I mean, really,

06:08.498 --> 06:10.195
is nothing sacred?

07:20.788 --> 07:22.485
Hi. I was hoping
to do s--

07:22.529 --> 07:24.008
Hey, there's no eating
in here.

07:24.052 --> 07:26.141
This is a "liberry."

07:26.184 --> 07:27.838
Of course.
Sorry.

07:27.882 --> 07:29.449
Um...

07:34.366 --> 07:37.152
Um, you want a napkin?

07:37.195 --> 07:38.806
Oh, no, I'm fine.

07:38.849 --> 07:42.418
Um, I was hoping to do
some computer research.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.203
I'm writing a book.
Mm.

07:45.247 --> 07:47.989
It's a romance novel,
actually.

07:48.032 --> 07:50.992
It's about a woman
who's sad.

07:51.035 --> 07:54.561
She's very sad, and she just
wasted the last 10 years

07:54.604 --> 07:57.564
of her life
on this terrible marriage.

07:57.607 --> 07:59.522
Very pathetic.

07:59.566 --> 08:01.916
It's very depressing
in the beginning, but, um --

08:01.959 --> 08:05.572
But then, one day,
she realizes what she wants --

08:05.615 --> 08:07.748
truly -- and she has
this brilliant plan.

08:07.791 --> 08:10.446
She keeps playing
perfect housewife,

08:10.490 --> 08:12.579
but in the meantime --Affair with her neighbor?

08:12.622 --> 08:13.580
What?

08:13.623 --> 08:15.799
No.

08:15.843 --> 08:19.020
She decides
to kill her husband.

08:19.063 --> 08:21.718
Why wouldn't
she just leave?

08:21.762 --> 08:24.199
Leave?

08:24.242 --> 08:26.549
Like it's easy?

08:26.593 --> 08:29.421
Like he'd just let her
take the $194 she has

08:29.465 --> 08:31.032
and buy a bus ticket
to Jersey?

08:31.075 --> 08:32.424
What -- No.
What would she do?

08:32.468 --> 08:34.383
Sleep on the street?

08:34.426 --> 08:35.776
No, he'd find her anyway.

08:35.819 --> 08:38.561
And maybe she doesn't want
to leave.

08:38.605 --> 08:39.954
Maybe this isn't about
leaving at all.

08:39.997 --> 08:43.610
Maybe she wants him dead,
and he deserves it.

08:43.653 --> 08:46.700
How is that romantic?

08:46.743 --> 08:48.353
It's aspirational.

08:51.574 --> 08:54.316
Computers are in back.

08:54.359 --> 08:55.926
Thank you.

09:49.023 --> 09:51.503
Hi. Excuse me?

09:51.547 --> 09:52.983
Sir?

09:53.027 --> 09:57.031
Um, sir?

09:57.074 --> 10:02.384
Hey, sorry, um,
how did you get past the, uh --

10:02.427 --> 10:03.603
the firewall?

10:06.867 --> 10:08.912
Sorry, excuse me?

10:08.956 --> 10:09.870
Hey.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.741
Oh!

10:13.961 --> 10:16.441
Oh, shit.

10:16.485 --> 10:17.704
Uh --

10:26.190 --> 10:29.324
You okay?

10:29.367 --> 10:31.761
Um... I don't know.

10:31.805 --> 10:34.329
I've never found
a dead body before,

10:34.372 --> 10:36.287
so I don't really know
if I did it right.

10:36.331 --> 10:37.941
"Did it right"?

10:37.985 --> 10:39.595
Well, I just didn't realize
I'd be so rattled.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.249
Better than being used
to it.

10:41.292 --> 10:43.077
By now,
an OD is welcome.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.514
At least oxys
aren't a mess.

10:45.557 --> 10:48.343
We got this call once --
300-pound dude,

10:48.386 --> 10:50.475
dead in his fourth floor
walk-up for like five months.

10:50.519 --> 10:52.260
Wait,
this guy overdosed?

10:52.303 --> 10:53.696
Yeah.

10:53.740 --> 10:56.177
But he was wearing
a Patagonia vest.

10:56.220 --> 10:58.527
-Okay?
-Well, he could afford
to shop at REI.

10:58.570 --> 11:00.181
He wasn't living
on the street.

11:00.224 --> 11:03.097
Yeah, there's no type
for this sort of thing anymore.

11:03.140 --> 11:05.360
All kinds of people OD.

11:05.403 --> 11:06.709
Really?

11:06.753 --> 11:08.363
Sure.

11:08.406 --> 11:09.581
So...

11:09.625 --> 11:11.801
like, anyone c--

11:11.845 --> 11:17.154
Garbage men, cable guys,
could be on oxys?

11:17.198 --> 11:19.461
Yeah, grandmas,
frat kids.

11:19.504 --> 11:22.377
Three of my cousins.

11:22.420 --> 11:25.119
I don't remember the last time
I was shocked by an oxy OD.

11:25.162 --> 11:27.599
But that 300-pound dude
leaking through the ceiling?

11:27.643 --> 11:30.428
That was a surprise.

11:30.472 --> 11:32.169
So, how'd you do it?

11:32.213 --> 11:35.129
I killed him with oxycodone
and made it look like an OD.

11:35.172 --> 11:36.608
Brilliant.

11:43.615 --> 11:45.313
Hello, Allison.

11:45.356 --> 11:46.749
Hi, Dr. Gaetz.

11:46.793 --> 11:49.056
Thank you for, uh,
seeing me so quickly.

11:49.099 --> 11:51.754
Of course. Kev carried
the bowling team on Thursday.

11:51.798 --> 11:53.756
I owe him one.
Ah.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.976
So, uh, first up, we're gonna
get your height and weight,

11:56.019 --> 11:57.978
and then we'll --Oh, do we have to?

11:58.021 --> 12:00.676
'Cause I'm just -- I'm just here
with some back trouble.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.678
Yep. Still need your height
and weight.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.941
-Come on.
-Take off my shoes.

12:04.985 --> 12:06.551
It really doesn't matter.

12:12.296 --> 12:15.778
So, you're having
some back pain.

12:15.822 --> 12:20.478
Yeah, um, lower back, mostly,
on the right-hand side.

12:20.522 --> 12:24.265
I have to, uh, carry a lot
of boxes at the package store,

12:24.308 --> 12:26.833
and it think I must have just
kind of tweaked last week

12:26.876 --> 12:29.661
carrying a box of Olde E
onto the hand truck.

12:32.055 --> 12:34.057
I know I should wear a brace,
but I have a hard time

12:34.101 --> 12:36.190
admitting when I need help.

12:44.459 --> 12:45.852
My, uh --
My Uncle Chu--

12:45.895 --> 12:49.029
Well, you know Chuck.

12:49.072 --> 12:51.466
Um, he has a slipped disc,

12:51.509 --> 12:53.860
and said that there's some pills
that, um,

12:53.903 --> 12:55.600
seem to be
really helping him.

13:02.085 --> 13:04.305
Allison.
Mm-hmm?

13:04.348 --> 13:07.743
You know,
pain medication,

13:07.787 --> 13:09.397
it's not given out
lightly.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.791
Yeah, no, I --
Yeah, and I --

13:11.834 --> 13:13.314
I wouldn't expect
that you --

13:13.357 --> 13:15.490
They're only given out
for people in real pain.

13:15.533 --> 13:18.667
Of course.

13:18.710 --> 13:22.845
These types of pills
get abused very often.

13:22.889 --> 13:25.195
Yeah, I've heard.

13:25.239 --> 13:28.503
I've -- I've heard that is --
It's awful.

13:31.941 --> 13:33.464
Yeah.
Ugh, yeah, yeah, right.

13:33.508 --> 13:34.901
I am --
I'm fine, and I don't

13:34.944 --> 13:36.859
want to get mixed up in all --
all that.

13:36.903 --> 13:39.906
I haven't even tried
acupuncture yet, so --

13:39.949 --> 13:42.560
You talk to Kevin
about this?

13:42.604 --> 13:44.954
Uh, about my back?

13:44.998 --> 13:47.087
I'm sure he'd want to chat
about it --

13:47.130 --> 13:50.133
your..."pain."

13:50.177 --> 13:51.918
I could call him with you
if you'd like--

13:51.961 --> 13:53.571
No, no, no.

13:53.615 --> 13:55.747
I -- I don't want to
bother him with all that.

13:55.791 --> 13:57.053
I am -- I'm fine.

13:57.097 --> 13:58.750
Allison.

13:58.794 --> 14:01.666
I think what you really need
is to talk to someone.

14:01.710 --> 14:03.843
Maybe not Kevin,
but a --

14:03.886 --> 14:06.236
a girlfriend or a --
a book club.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.369
You got a book club
where you sit around

14:08.412 --> 14:10.588
with wine
and chat about things?

14:10.632 --> 14:12.547
Eh, not really.

14:12.590 --> 14:15.550
Well, maybe a coworker.

14:15.593 --> 14:17.465
Before you try...

14:17.508 --> 14:19.467
acupuncture,

14:19.510 --> 14:20.903
I think
you need to talk.

14:25.995 --> 14:28.868
That'll be $75
for today's visit.

14:30.957 --> 14:31.914
Yeah, sure.

14:43.447 --> 14:45.797
You know, if you're looking
for a good person --

14:45.841 --> 14:47.887
someone to talk to --
I know someone.

14:47.930 --> 14:49.105
Great with this sort of thing.

14:49.149 --> 14:50.585
-A-A professional.
-No, thanks.

14:50.628 --> 14:52.674
I don't do therapy.

14:52.717 --> 14:55.198
It's worth considering.

14:55.242 --> 14:57.635
Yeah, well, just the thought
of paying a stranger

14:57.679 --> 14:59.420
to listen to me complain --
I --

14:59.463 --> 15:01.030
I-It's not like that.

15:01.074 --> 15:02.858
Well, it's just,
it's not for me.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.207
I swear, she helped
my sister-in-law.

15:04.251 --> 15:05.600
Same thing.
Alright?

15:05.643 --> 15:06.949
Needed a little something
for herself.

15:06.993 --> 15:07.776
Maybe not the greatest
marriage --

15:07.819 --> 15:09.386
Oh. Thank you.

15:35.499 --> 15:36.718
Oh. Ugh.

15:36.761 --> 15:39.677
No, no.
I got it.

15:39.721 --> 15:42.028
Yeah, I'm --
I'm not sure why I'm the one

15:42.071 --> 15:44.856
hauling all the boxes
back and forth.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.815
Even though I got
15 years on you.

15:46.858 --> 15:49.165
-It's fine.
Sorry.

15:49.209 --> 15:52.299
Uh, my back's been hurting
a little bit.

15:52.342 --> 15:54.866
How's Uncle Chuck's back
been doing, by the way?

15:54.910 --> 15:57.043
Uh, well, you know.

15:57.086 --> 15:58.261
Waiting for
the insurance company

15:58.305 --> 16:00.394
to approve the surgery
on his bulging disc,

16:00.437 --> 16:03.484
and still saying
the procedure's "experimental."

16:03.527 --> 16:05.007
I mean,
they know he needs it.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.008
I don't know what
the big experiment is.

16:06.052 --> 16:07.488
So...
Right.

16:07.531 --> 16:09.794
He's pretty much laid up
asking for meatball subs

16:09.838 --> 16:11.666
and whiskey rocks
from the couch.

16:11.709 --> 16:14.712
But it's fine.

16:14.756 --> 16:17.367
You still, uh, dole out
his pain meds, or...?

16:17.411 --> 16:19.195
Ugh.

16:19.239 --> 16:20.805
Chuck says it makes him
feel like a child,

16:20.849 --> 16:22.633
having me be in charge
of him, so...

16:22.677 --> 16:24.026
Yeah.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.375
He insists he can
handle it himself

16:25.419 --> 16:27.160
and I don't wanna
argue anymore.

16:30.380 --> 16:31.686
Allison.

16:31.729 --> 16:33.601
Huh?

16:33.644 --> 16:35.690
Are you giving up?

16:35.733 --> 16:39.302
Uh, how do you mean?

16:39.346 --> 16:40.303
B--

16:40.347 --> 16:44.264
What's going on here?

16:44.307 --> 16:45.743
Oh, uh --

16:45.787 --> 16:48.398
You like like
10 miles of bad highway.

16:48.442 --> 16:51.445
It's, uh, actually
my new favorite.

16:51.488 --> 16:53.708
Oh, it --
it's got stains.

16:53.751 --> 16:55.318
I know.

16:55.362 --> 16:57.581
I like 'em.

16:57.625 --> 16:59.540
Okay.

16:59.583 --> 17:02.673
Thing is...this sweatshirt
is actually a--

17:02.717 --> 17:05.589
I mean, you've got a good shape
going on under all of that.

17:05.633 --> 17:07.678
Don't just
let yourself go.

17:07.722 --> 17:10.681
It's not fair to Kev
to just give up.

17:10.725 --> 17:14.337
Not fair to Kev?

17:14.381 --> 17:17.210
Look, I should be wearing
orthopedic shoes

17:17.253 --> 17:19.081
from Hawley Lane
for my plantars,

17:19.125 --> 17:21.170
but Chuck says they make me
look like a night nurse

17:21.214 --> 17:22.780
coming in
to change his diaper.

17:22.824 --> 17:24.173
Mm.
So what do I do?

17:24.217 --> 17:26.306
I go over to Target,
I get myself nice flats.

17:26.349 --> 17:29.526
I deal with my arches
on my own time.

17:29.570 --> 17:31.789
Okay, well, you know you don't
have to do that, right?

17:31.833 --> 17:34.314
'Cause that's --
that's crazy.

17:34.357 --> 17:35.489
No, honey.

17:35.532 --> 17:38.666
That's marriage.

17:38.709 --> 17:43.366
Uh, h-h-has Kev
seen this new look?

17:43.410 --> 17:45.673
-No.
-Oh, good.

17:45.716 --> 17:47.109
No, I just wear this here.

17:47.153 --> 17:48.589
Oh.'Cause I -- I get cold.

17:48.632 --> 17:50.547
Yeah, yeah.

17:50.591 --> 17:52.767
Well, okay.

17:52.810 --> 17:55.161
I'll pick up a space heater
from Lowe's.

17:55.204 --> 17:56.901
Warm you right up.

18:36.158 --> 18:37.551
Ugh.

18:37.594 --> 18:38.856
...the minute I saw them!

18:38.900 --> 18:41.294
They took it!
I know they did!

18:41.337 --> 18:43.731
-What's going on here?
-Oh!

18:43.774 --> 18:45.994
I've got a terrible feeling
about something.

18:46.037 --> 18:48.170
Let's check it out,
shall we?

18:48.214 --> 18:50.520
Alexer?
Where's my stuff?

18:52.392 --> 18:55.438
What the hell?
It works for you!

18:55.482 --> 18:56.613
Well,
it's not "Alexer."

18:56.657 --> 18:58.441
It's "Alexa."

18:58.485 --> 18:59.747
That's what I'm saying.

18:59.790 --> 19:01.357
Alexer.

19:01.401 --> 19:04.012
Alexer,
where's my stuff?

19:05.492 --> 19:07.581
What am I doing wrong?!

19:07.624 --> 19:09.757
Speaking English.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.977
Okay, try this.
Say "Alexer."

19:13.021 --> 19:14.631
Alexa.

19:14.675 --> 19:16.198
There ya go.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.983
Alexa,
where's my stuff?

19:19.027 --> 19:22.465
<i>One shipment was
delivered for Kevin today.</i>

19:22.509 --> 19:24.250
Foul play!

19:24.293 --> 19:26.252
My Belichick hoodie --
the closest thing

19:26.295 --> 19:28.645
I have to a child --
was stolen!

19:28.689 --> 19:30.125
Ugh.
You don't want children.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.040
Remember?
You said it pulls focus

19:32.083 --> 19:33.433
from what really matters
in life --

19:33.476 --> 19:35.086
your needs.

19:35.130 --> 19:37.698
That sweatshirt was gonna be
my test case --

19:37.741 --> 19:39.656
my pride and joy.

19:39.700 --> 19:42.920
Instead, it's probably stuffed
in the neighbor's closet.

19:42.964 --> 19:46.272
All cold and alone.

19:46.315 --> 19:49.710
Not even knowing
I'm trying to find it.

19:49.753 --> 19:51.451
It knows, Kev.

19:51.494 --> 19:54.280
Damn foreigners
are tearing my boy apart!

19:54.323 --> 19:56.717
Pete, you blame hurricanes
on foreigners.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.284
Are you sure it's them?

19:58.327 --> 20:00.938
Maybe it was just a mistake
with the mailman.

20:00.982 --> 20:03.593
Allison,
whose side are you on?

20:03.637 --> 20:05.726
Sanity's.

20:05.769 --> 20:09.251
Well, it's obvious
what has to be done.

20:09.295 --> 20:11.253
Set UPS on fire.

20:12.515 --> 20:14.474
-No.
-Set the neighbors on fire.

20:14.517 --> 20:16.345
No!

20:16.389 --> 20:19.696
Neil, we don't let you
do fire anymore, remember?

20:19.740 --> 20:21.132
I know.

20:21.176 --> 20:23.004
But still...

20:23.047 --> 20:24.832
the flame...

20:24.875 --> 20:28.531
she calls to me.

20:28.575 --> 20:31.534
We have to have
a Revolutionary War reboot!

20:31.578 --> 20:33.144
I love a reboot.

20:33.188 --> 20:35.451
This is almost as good
as the new "CHiPs"!

20:35.495 --> 20:37.366
Rebels versus Redcoats.

20:37.410 --> 20:41.109
Stealing that sweatshirt was
as bad as the Boston Massacre.

20:41.152 --> 20:42.980
Worse!

20:43.024 --> 20:45.722
You guys said the same thing
about cinnamon gum.

20:45.766 --> 20:48.421
It's too hot.

20:48.464 --> 20:51.772
Gum is meant to be minty
and refreshing.

20:51.815 --> 20:52.773
It's on!

20:52.816 --> 20:54.383
Pat, go to the salon.

20:54.427 --> 20:55.558
Get those leftover
Roman candles.

20:55.602 --> 20:57.212
-We're gonna need ammo.
-Roger that.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.214
You left the fireworks
at the salon?

20:59.258 --> 21:00.911
There's so many times
I wanted to use them!

21:00.955 --> 21:04.524
We don't let you
do fire anymore!

21:04.567 --> 21:05.786
Let's go, men!

21:05.829 --> 21:07.309
We got a war to win!

21:07.353 --> 21:08.528
Yes! Ow!

21:08.571 --> 21:09.572
Oh! Hernia!

21:09.616 --> 21:10.965
Alright, I'm good!

21:11.008 --> 21:12.923
-You alright?
-I'm good!

21:12.967 --> 21:14.969
We're men!

21:15.012 --> 21:16.666
U.S.A.!Ow!

21:16.710 --> 21:19.756
U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

21:19.800 --> 21:21.541
U.S.A.!

21:21.584 --> 21:22.716
Hi.

21:22.759 --> 21:23.717
Hey.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.589
Hey.
Oh.

21:26.633 --> 21:28.983
What's up?
Nothin'.

21:29.026 --> 21:30.985
'Cause I've been dying
to show you, uh --

21:31.028 --> 21:32.595
-Just, like, show someone.
Can it wait?

21:32.639 --> 21:34.031
I gotta get to the salon
and start looking

21:34.075 --> 21:35.729
for those Roman candles.
They're buried

21:35.772 --> 21:36.991
in the crawl space somewhere
and I'm gonna hit my head

21:37.034 --> 21:39.776
at least three times
trying to get 'em.

21:39.820 --> 21:43.737
You're actually gonna help them
with that?

21:43.780 --> 21:45.347
Yeah.

21:45.391 --> 21:46.783
Oh.

21:46.827 --> 21:49.264
What?
No, nothing.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.483
I just thought
that we were, uh --

21:50.526 --> 21:53.442
"We"?

21:53.486 --> 21:55.531
I never really thought of us
as a "we."

21:58.839 --> 22:01.494
Yeah. Right.

22:01.537 --> 22:03.147
My mistake.

22:05.889 --> 22:08.196
So why the hell you tell me
about the money, then?

22:08.239 --> 22:09.980
About Kevin?

22:10.024 --> 22:11.242
I called the bank,
and you were right.

22:11.286 --> 22:14.289
The money's gone.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.378
You blew up my life.
Was that just for fun?

22:18.946 --> 22:20.643
No.

22:24.255 --> 22:27.476
I felt sorry for you.

22:27.520 --> 22:30.436
Convincing yourself all
your dreams are gonna come true.

22:30.479 --> 22:32.176
That you were destined
for something bigger than this.

22:32.220 --> 22:34.788
That you were gonna
be happy.

22:34.831 --> 22:37.094
It was hard to watch.

22:37.138 --> 22:39.880
I'm bad
with cringe comedy.

22:39.923 --> 22:43.884
Okay. So, I'm an idiot
for wanting something,

22:43.927 --> 22:46.016
and you're fine
with hitting your head

22:46.060 --> 22:48.584
looking for the Roman candles
for the rest of your life?

22:50.760 --> 22:54.373
Yes.

22:54.416 --> 22:56.375
You felt sorry for me.

23:29.059 --> 23:30.060
They're oatmeal raisin!

23:30.104 --> 23:31.888
Oh!
Ugh!

23:31.932 --> 23:33.629
Why would you put fruit
in a cookie?

23:33.673 --> 23:35.849
Mixed messaging!

23:35.892 --> 23:37.720
Like a dessert
with homework.

23:37.764 --> 23:40.897
Yeah, it's like putting
a vegetable in a -- a cookie.

23:43.944 --> 23:45.946
Oh, dear God.

23:45.989 --> 23:48.035
No need to invoke
the Lord.

23:48.078 --> 23:49.471
The neighbors stole
my jersey,

23:49.515 --> 23:52.909
so I rightfully stole
one of theirs.

23:52.953 --> 23:55.172
Pretty sure we got the Big Man's
blessing on this.

23:55.216 --> 23:58.088
After all -- eye for an eye,
tit for tit.

23:59.873 --> 24:02.136
Look, does it always have to be
"tit for tit"?

24:02.179 --> 24:03.877
Can't just you let
some things go?

24:05.356 --> 24:07.576
This is a Revolutionary War,
Allison.

24:07.620 --> 24:09.099
Could you imagine
if George Washington

24:09.143 --> 24:11.493
just "let things go"?

24:11.537 --> 24:14.104
Yeah, I can.
We'd be Communists.

24:14.148 --> 24:16.977
Oh, honey.
Not even close.

24:17.020 --> 24:18.848
Well, look at me.
I had a tiff with a friend,

24:18.892 --> 24:21.155
so I baked some cookies
to make peace.

24:21.198 --> 24:23.505
-What friend?
-They're made up.

24:23.549 --> 24:26.160
Just like leprechauns.

24:26.203 --> 24:27.378
You taught me that.

24:27.422 --> 24:30.381
Ouugh!

24:30.425 --> 24:32.558
It was on the doorstep.

24:32.601 --> 24:34.560
It's a message.

24:34.603 --> 24:37.693
You want
to let it go now, Allison?!

24:37.737 --> 24:39.303
So, what is the message,
exactly?

24:39.347 --> 24:41.262
That they're not
playing around.

24:41.305 --> 24:43.351
Look at this!

24:43.394 --> 24:47.007
It's clearly a Deflategate dig,
and it is not taken well.

24:47.050 --> 24:49.009
Again, not even close.

24:49.052 --> 24:51.272
Grrrgh!

24:51.315 --> 24:52.534
Wait up!

24:52.578 --> 24:54.014
Drgh!

24:59.019 --> 25:01.238
Really.

25:01.282 --> 25:03.327
What friend
are these for?

25:03.371 --> 25:05.242
Uh, someone who doesn't pretend
to hate things

25:05.286 --> 25:07.723
they like just to be
one of the guys.

25:07.767 --> 25:10.596
Jesus, are you
an after-school special?

25:11.858 --> 25:13.555
Come on.

25:13.599 --> 25:16.427
It's someone I can
actually talk to.

25:16.471 --> 25:19.256
-Hi.
-Oh, what the hell?

25:19.300 --> 25:20.954
No, I know.
I just came to apologize.

25:20.997 --> 25:22.346
Careful, Marcus.

25:22.390 --> 25:23.609
Barbie might break
your nose this time.

25:23.652 --> 25:25.741
Okay. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

25:25.785 --> 25:27.351
Come here.
What are you --

25:27.395 --> 25:29.005
Look, I was in a terrible
place that day,

25:29.049 --> 25:30.616
and I made
a huge mistake.

25:30.659 --> 25:32.139
I've never actually slapped
anyone before --

25:32.182 --> 25:34.271
Whoa, no, no, no. Hold on.
You didn't slap me, tough guy.

25:34.315 --> 25:36.404
I was fine.
Okay.

25:36.447 --> 25:38.624
Uh, of course.

25:38.667 --> 25:42.584
Either way, I was very rude,
and, um,

25:42.628 --> 25:45.544
so I wanted
to make it up to you.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.371
Are you serious?

25:47.415 --> 25:48.634
I dunno.

25:48.677 --> 25:50.244
Everyone likes cookies.

25:50.287 --> 25:52.812
It's a good gift.

25:52.855 --> 25:54.030
You're not gonna be
a pain in the ass

25:54.074 --> 25:55.336
asking me for coke now,
are you?

25:55.379 --> 25:58.469
No, no, no, no, no.
No.

25:58.513 --> 26:01.081
Gave me some interesting ideas,
but, uh,

26:01.124 --> 26:03.387
I feel like my body's
still recovering.

26:03.431 --> 26:05.825
No, uh...

26:05.868 --> 26:07.043
I want oxys.

26:07.087 --> 26:08.523
Jesus Christ.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.481
Just like
10 to 15 pills.

26:10.525 --> 26:12.701
I've already tried to get
a doctor to give them to me --

26:12.745 --> 26:14.703
Of course your first thought
was to ask nicely.

26:14.747 --> 26:16.183
He just sent me to a therapist,
and I --

26:16.226 --> 26:17.663
I need these.

26:17.706 --> 26:20.187
I'm in very real pain.

26:20.230 --> 26:22.406
Marcus,
use your rape whistle.

26:22.450 --> 26:24.974
Okay.
Private conversation.

26:29.762 --> 26:33.069
Look, I don't have
that shit on me, okay?

26:33.113 --> 26:34.636
I -- I'm not that guy.

26:34.680 --> 26:39.206
But, uh, I can hook you up
with one.

26:39.249 --> 26:41.687
Really?

26:41.730 --> 26:43.166
Oh, my God, okay.

26:43.210 --> 26:45.908
Thank you.

26:45.952 --> 26:49.390
Be on the 14th Street
overpass at midnight.

26:49.433 --> 26:51.087
Tonight.
Okay.

26:51.131 --> 26:52.219
Don't try
to pay in cookies.

26:52.262 --> 26:55.091
N-No.

26:55.135 --> 26:56.876
No, okay.

26:56.919 --> 26:58.486
Uh, thank you.

26:58.529 --> 27:00.053
Mm-hmm.

27:03.230 --> 27:06.059
Uh, hey, I know it's not cash,
but, uh, do you think

27:06.102 --> 27:08.496
that he'd think that this hoodie
was worth something?

27:11.499 --> 27:13.370
Oh, it looks awful.

27:13.414 --> 27:16.547
Uh, t-this was --
this was worn by Belichick.

27:18.680 --> 27:21.117
Bill Belichick?

27:21.161 --> 27:23.729
My, uh -- my husband paid
Lord knows how much for it,

27:23.772 --> 27:25.165
but God forbid I ask.

27:25.208 --> 27:26.949
Lady.
Um, Allison.

27:26.993 --> 27:29.169
I don't want to know your name
or your story.

27:29.212 --> 27:31.693
I don't care.
Right.

27:31.737 --> 27:33.739
Now get the hell
out of here.

27:33.782 --> 27:35.523
Okay.
Bye-bye, now.

27:35.566 --> 27:36.567
Yes. Goodbye.

27:36.611 --> 27:38.700
Okay.
Okay.

27:38.744 --> 27:42.182
-Thank you.
-Thanks for the raisin cookies.

27:42.225 --> 27:43.923
Don't worry about
washing the bowl.

27:50.364 --> 27:51.582
-Gah!

27:52.975 --> 27:54.760
-What are you doing?!
-Gotta protect my lady.

27:54.803 --> 27:55.761
Can't be too cautious.

27:55.804 --> 27:57.632
Well, can't you?!

27:57.676 --> 28:00.069
Not when the neighbors lit
our garbage cans on fire.

28:00.113 --> 28:01.941
They what?!
Why would they do that?

28:01.984 --> 28:04.421
Well,
after Knife-In-Football-Gate,

28:04.465 --> 28:06.946
I had one of those strokes
of genius.

28:06.989 --> 28:09.731
I shoved a cherry bomb
inside a soccer --

28:09.775 --> 28:12.821
soccer! --

28:12.865 --> 28:15.302
ball, and I put it
on their front lawn.

28:15.345 --> 28:16.782
A true message.

28:16.825 --> 28:19.610
What, that soccer blows?

28:19.654 --> 28:20.873
Solid.

28:22.178 --> 28:24.746
What?
N-No.

28:24.790 --> 28:26.617
That they cannot mess
with me!

28:26.661 --> 28:29.490
And that message
was received.

28:29.533 --> 28:31.013
You should have seen it.

28:31.057 --> 28:33.015
The sparks!
The colors!

28:33.059 --> 28:34.800
Little flaming hexagons
flying everywhere.

28:34.843 --> 28:38.586
It was -- It was --
It was spectacular!

28:38.629 --> 28:40.980
But I also burned
their lawn.

28:41.023 --> 28:42.459
<i>You</i> lit their lawn
on fire?

28:42.503 --> 28:44.157
-I heard about that.
-It's fine.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.028
A little singe will
just make the grass

28:46.072 --> 28:47.769
grow back twice
as lush --

28:47.813 --> 28:50.946
if it's anything
like my foot hair.

28:50.990 --> 28:52.513
So, that's when they torched
our garbage cans?

28:52.556 --> 28:53.601
Yeah.
Can you believe it?

28:53.644 --> 28:55.603
It's practically arson.

28:55.646 --> 28:56.909
Well, you lit their lawn
on fire!

28:56.952 --> 28:58.388
They stole
my sweatshirt!

28:58.432 --> 29:00.216
You burned down
their pergola!

29:00.260 --> 29:04.264
Irregardless, this is all just
ramping up so fast,

29:04.307 --> 29:05.831
we had to beef up
security.

29:05.874 --> 29:06.832
And that's our security?

29:06.875 --> 29:08.355
Well, the bat is step one.

29:08.398 --> 29:09.791
Step two is--

29:09.835 --> 29:12.228
Ah, Neil returns
with step three.

29:12.272 --> 29:13.534
I sent him to my guy.

29:13.577 --> 29:15.666
He's former SWAT.

29:15.710 --> 29:17.059
Neil, what are you doing?

29:17.103 --> 29:19.366
Well, this is what
your guy gave me.

29:19.409 --> 29:20.976
Kev!
You caved!

29:21.020 --> 29:23.152
Wha?

29:23.196 --> 29:25.024
You got me a dog?'Course not.

29:25.067 --> 29:26.808
My "No Pets" rule stands.

29:26.852 --> 29:30.029
I refuse not to be
the cutest thing in this house.

29:30.072 --> 29:31.639
Impossible, babe.

29:31.682 --> 29:33.989
Besides,
that's not a dog.

29:34.033 --> 29:35.295
That's a mistake.

29:35.338 --> 29:36.992
Neil, I-I sent you to my guy
to get,

29:37.036 --> 29:39.995
like, a rifle
or a crossbow or something.

29:40.039 --> 29:41.692
Yeah, well, your guy said
this was the most weapon

29:41.736 --> 29:43.520
I could handle.

29:43.564 --> 29:45.696
It's something.
Is it?

29:45.740 --> 29:48.699
I don't know.
He looks tired.

29:48.743 --> 29:50.179
Maybe a little slow.

29:50.223 --> 29:51.833
Yeah.

29:51.877 --> 29:54.836
And lazy.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.317
Doesn't seem like
McRoberts material.

29:58.971 --> 30:02.104
Dog, you're here
on a trial basis.

30:02.148 --> 30:04.498
No name till you're
off probation.

30:04.541 --> 30:06.239
And no cavortin'
with my wife.

30:07.675 --> 30:09.111
Okay,
so, what's step two?

30:09.155 --> 30:10.330
Huh?

30:10.373 --> 30:11.679
Well,
step one's the bat.

30:11.722 --> 30:12.898
Step three is the dog.

30:12.941 --> 30:14.769
So what's step two?

30:14.813 --> 30:17.903
Oh, I installed a full
DING security system outside.

30:17.946 --> 30:20.470
Cameras at every door,
motion-sensored.

30:20.514 --> 30:21.732
I've got it wired, babe.

30:21.776 --> 30:23.604
I'm feeling diligent,

30:23.647 --> 30:24.605
focused.

30:26.172 --> 30:28.783
You got chips there?

30:28.827 --> 30:30.741
-I brought them from home.
-Did you, now?

30:30.785 --> 30:31.830
You know what they say
about sharing.

30:31.873 --> 30:33.527
No.
Gimme.

30:47.541 --> 30:48.934
God damn it.

31:05.733 --> 31:07.300
Hi.

31:07.343 --> 31:09.258
Good boy.

31:09.302 --> 31:10.520
Hmm?

31:10.564 --> 31:12.348
That's a good boy.

31:12.392 --> 31:13.610
What's this?

31:13.654 --> 31:15.047
Yeah,
you're a good boy.

31:18.311 --> 31:20.356
Well, actually, no.

31:20.400 --> 31:21.444
That's not a nice thing
to say.

31:21.488 --> 31:24.056
I'm sorry.

31:24.099 --> 31:27.102
Good boys don't get
to do anything fun.

31:27.146 --> 31:28.712
Trust me, I get it.

31:31.802 --> 31:34.109
This is my first time
sneaking out of a house.

31:36.677 --> 31:39.810
Why'd I wait so long to do
something like this, huh?

31:39.854 --> 31:42.813
It's exciting.

31:42.857 --> 31:44.380
It'll be a good story.

31:49.211 --> 31:51.126
Oh.

31:53.215 --> 31:55.957
Hey.

31:56.001 --> 31:57.828
You wanna know
another good story?

32:01.049 --> 32:02.921
I stole the goddamn hoodie.

32:05.793 --> 32:07.577
Don't rat me out, okay, pal?

32:11.016 --> 32:14.410
Thank you.

32:14.454 --> 32:16.238
You stay there.

33:05.287 --> 33:06.593
Uh...

33:06.636 --> 33:08.073
You Marcus' girl?

33:08.116 --> 33:10.118
Yeah.
Well, no.

33:10.162 --> 33:13.817
I'm not his girl, but --I got ya.

33:13.861 --> 33:16.429
Uh, how do you wanna
do this?

33:16.472 --> 33:18.692
Uh...

33:18.735 --> 33:21.695
However you'd normally do it
is good, I guess.

33:21.738 --> 33:24.306
Money first?

33:24.350 --> 33:26.091
Sounds good.

33:26.134 --> 33:28.397
W-What do you want to pay --So, wha-- Oh.

33:28.441 --> 33:30.530
You g--
Uh, y-you go first. Sorry.

33:30.573 --> 33:33.924
Uh, $200?
No way.

33:33.968 --> 33:35.752
Most girls in your position
would be kissing the ground

33:35.796 --> 33:37.015
I walk on
for that price.

33:37.058 --> 33:40.757
Well, I'm not most girls,
so...

33:40.801 --> 33:42.237
$120, final offer.

33:46.850 --> 33:48.678
Get in.

33:58.688 --> 34:00.560
Uh, where we going?

34:00.603 --> 34:02.170
We can't do this
right here.

34:15.009 --> 34:16.576
Oh.

34:20.710 --> 34:22.973
S-- Uh--
So, you got the stuff?

34:23.017 --> 34:25.541
Oh -- Oh, I got your stuff
right here.

34:25.585 --> 34:27.848
No, wha--
What the hell are you doing?

34:27.891 --> 34:29.371
Oh, right.

34:29.415 --> 34:32.070
Marcus said you were
into that sort of thing.

34:32.113 --> 34:33.810
"Oh, no, Mister.
I'm not that kind of guy."

34:33.854 --> 34:36.335
What?! No! No!
I'm not gonna have sex with you!

34:36.378 --> 34:38.728
Marcus said I --
I would have sex with you?!

34:38.772 --> 34:40.948
E-- That's usually
what the money's for, yeah.

34:40.991 --> 34:43.907
Oh, my --
No, I'm not a prostitu--

34:43.951 --> 34:46.301
Marcus said
that you'd sell me pills.

34:46.345 --> 34:48.173
Like, drugs?

34:48.216 --> 34:51.306
La-- Lady,
I sell life insurance.

34:54.440 --> 34:57.747
Marcus was trying
to get back at me, so it --

34:57.791 --> 35:00.141
I'm sorry, I have to go.

35:00.185 --> 35:01.490
Whoa, wait, wait,
wait, wait.
Ah!

35:01.534 --> 35:02.752
God damn!
Oh!

35:02.796 --> 35:04.363
What the hell?!

35:04.406 --> 35:06.626
I-I -- I --
I was just trying to tell you

35:06.669 --> 35:07.975
there's a child lock
on that door.

35:08.018 --> 35:09.324
Oh, my God.

35:09.368 --> 35:11.413
You --
You broke my frickin' nose!

35:11.457 --> 35:12.806
I'm so sorry.

35:12.849 --> 35:15.156
Here, here, here.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.984
Ow! God!
Oh!

35:17.027 --> 35:19.813
Gah!
Jesus Christ, lady!

35:23.860 --> 35:26.211
The least you could do
is give me a handjob.

35:26.254 --> 35:27.951
Oh.

35:27.995 --> 35:29.518
No, thank you.

36:18.088 --> 36:19.264
-Allie.
-Hey.

36:19.307 --> 36:21.353
-Uh, it's late.
-Yeah, sorry.

36:22.919 --> 36:25.226
Um, how are you?

36:25.270 --> 36:27.489
Uh...

36:27.533 --> 36:30.579
Uh, I don't really know
how to answer that question.

36:30.623 --> 36:33.234
I know that I am supposed
to say, "I'm good.

36:33.278 --> 36:34.714
How are you?"

36:34.757 --> 36:36.933
Anything more than that
is just rude.

36:36.977 --> 36:38.500
No one actually wants to know
how you are.

36:38.544 --> 36:39.806
It's just a way of saying,
"Hello.

36:39.849 --> 36:42.243
I'm good, how are you?"

36:42.287 --> 36:45.464
Uh, but I actually
wanted to...

36:45.507 --> 36:48.118
talk.

36:48.162 --> 36:49.598
To me?

36:49.642 --> 36:51.252
Yeah.

36:51.296 --> 36:54.124
Thought maybe you were mad
or something.

36:54.168 --> 36:57.302
Why would I be mad?

36:57.345 --> 36:58.651
Right.

36:58.694 --> 37:00.870
Sure.

37:00.914 --> 37:01.871
You want a coffee
or something?

37:01.915 --> 37:03.743
Uh...

37:03.786 --> 37:05.745
After the night I had,
I'd say an Irish coffee,

37:05.788 --> 37:08.095
but I don't want
to make you do that.

37:08.138 --> 37:09.618
I can muscle through.

37:09.662 --> 37:12.273
Well -- No, I was being --
I was being rude.

37:12.317 --> 37:14.101
Impossible.

37:14.144 --> 37:17.409
This is really for me.

37:17.452 --> 37:20.977
I used to love mixing drinks
for you.

37:21.021 --> 37:24.154
Remember our, uh,
white trash margarita?

37:24.198 --> 37:25.982
Yeah.

37:26.026 --> 37:28.158
Yellow Gatorade
and tequila.

37:28.202 --> 37:30.596
-With a maraschino cherry.
-Ugh.

37:30.639 --> 37:33.642
Of all the drinks I miss,
that one's pretty high up there.

37:38.386 --> 37:39.866
Thank you.

37:41.911 --> 37:42.956
Mmm.

37:42.999 --> 37:45.306
Mm.

37:45.350 --> 37:49.484
So, you wanted to talk?

37:49.528 --> 37:52.095
Yeah.

37:52.139 --> 37:55.055
About?

37:55.098 --> 37:58.014
Uh...

37:58.058 --> 37:59.842
Something that isn't
the weather,

37:59.886 --> 38:04.325
or my aunt's foot ailments,
or the feud with the neighbors.

38:06.632 --> 38:08.198
I've had the worst...

38:10.375 --> 38:11.985
decade, really.

38:12.028 --> 38:13.334
Like, I can't believe
how much time

38:13.378 --> 38:15.423
I've spent
talking about nothing.

38:15.467 --> 38:18.600
And now that I feel like I
actually have something to say,

38:18.644 --> 38:21.168
um, the closest thing
that I have

38:21.211 --> 38:24.693
to someone who cares
is a dog.

38:27.609 --> 38:30.308
I care.

38:30.351 --> 38:33.615
Just that you knew me
before --

38:33.659 --> 38:34.964
W-When we were younger.

38:37.532 --> 38:39.882
I had friends, right?

38:39.926 --> 38:42.450
Yeah.

38:42.494 --> 38:44.800
Yeah, I feel like
they all had names

38:44.844 --> 38:49.152
that started
with J, K, and L.

38:49.196 --> 38:52.155
Katie, Kelly, Lauren,
Lindsay --

38:52.199 --> 38:53.418
-Julie.
Jess.

38:53.461 --> 38:54.636
They liked church.

38:54.680 --> 38:56.377
They loved church.
Mm.

38:56.421 --> 38:57.770
And your friends
in the swim team.

38:57.813 --> 38:59.293
Well, no.

38:59.337 --> 39:00.207
Those girls didn't really
like me.

39:00.250 --> 39:02.035
I was a bit --

39:02.078 --> 39:04.385
bit competitive.

39:04.429 --> 39:05.778
"Was"?

39:05.821 --> 39:08.433
Okay.

39:08.476 --> 39:09.825
And I had the people
at the restaurant,

39:09.869 --> 39:12.872
and I had you.

39:12.915 --> 39:16.876
I just don't know when I got
so isolated from everyone.

39:18.921 --> 39:20.662
Wish you'd been here
for the last 10 years.

39:20.706 --> 39:23.622
I mean, I'm not sure
that would've actually helped.

39:26.799 --> 39:30.324
Why?

39:30.368 --> 39:32.805
People who think they're
cut off from everyone

39:32.848 --> 39:36.112
are actually often walling
themselves off from the world.

39:36.156 --> 39:37.592
Okay, can we not?
'Cause I've already

39:37.636 --> 39:39.768
turned down therapy
once this week, so --

39:39.812 --> 39:41.379
No, yeah.
Sure.

39:46.166 --> 39:48.124
I'm just saying,

39:48.168 --> 39:52.085
when you talk about wishing
I'd been here...

39:52.128 --> 39:53.478
you're the one
who pulled away.

39:56.916 --> 39:58.700
I pulled away?

39:58.744 --> 40:01.355
Okay,
I mean, you were gone

40:01.399 --> 40:02.704
way before I got married,
okay?

40:02.748 --> 40:04.097
Uh-- How are we talking
about this?

40:04.140 --> 40:05.707
I just wanted someone
to talk with.

40:05.751 --> 40:07.709
Did you, though?

40:07.753 --> 40:09.494
'Cause from where I'm sitting,
you wanted someone

40:09.537 --> 40:12.671
to listen and nod
and agree with you.

40:14.934 --> 40:16.849
You know what?

40:16.892 --> 40:19.634
I take it back.

40:19.678 --> 40:21.506
I'm good.
How are you?

40:30.428 --> 40:32.473
Wha--
Have we been robbed?

40:32.517 --> 40:35.650
That is
absolutely correct.

40:35.694 --> 40:37.173
Shouldn't we be calling
the police?

40:37.217 --> 40:39.828
Oh, simple Allison.

40:39.872 --> 40:42.265
This is all a part
of my master plan.

40:42.309 --> 40:43.876
Okay, well, the last time
you said that,

40:43.919 --> 40:46.661
we had to cut down the oak tree
to get you out of it.

40:46.705 --> 40:50.360
That tree was an eyesore
for 300 years.

40:50.404 --> 40:52.362
Paul Revere planted it.

40:52.406 --> 40:54.364
Just listen.

40:54.408 --> 40:56.584
The security system picked up
some of those damn neighbors

40:56.628 --> 40:58.064
lurking outside the house
last night.

40:58.107 --> 40:59.369
Really?

40:59.413 --> 41:00.893
Wh--
How do you know it was them?

41:00.936 --> 41:03.852
Uh, he was wearing
the hoodie.

41:06.725 --> 41:09.031
That's tough, babe.

41:09.075 --> 41:10.903
Thank you.

41:10.946 --> 41:14.210
But as I was trying to lure
an entire family of skunks

41:14.254 --> 41:15.995
under the neighbor's house,

41:16.038 --> 41:19.215
I realized that that security
footage gives me all the ammo

41:19.259 --> 41:20.913
I need to go
to the insurance company.

41:20.956 --> 41:23.742
So, ta-dah!

41:23.785 --> 41:25.744
Kevin, we agreed
you'd give up magic

41:25.787 --> 41:28.703
when that playing card
punctured your eardrum.

41:28.747 --> 41:31.750
Allison, I can't even hear you
to agree with you.

41:33.360 --> 41:36.537
This is the magic
of insurance.

41:36.581 --> 41:38.626
I talked to the guy
about my stolen hoodie

41:38.670 --> 41:42.195
and all the, eh -- wink --
other stuff missin' here.

41:42.238 --> 41:44.719
Guy's coming down later today
to take claims on everything.

41:44.763 --> 41:48.027
TV, Wade Boggs rookie card,
your father's ashes.

41:48.070 --> 41:49.550
-Kevin.
-I'm just kidding.

41:49.594 --> 41:51.596
He's not worth anything.

41:51.639 --> 41:54.599
No, I mean,
isn't this fraud?

41:54.642 --> 41:55.991
No way.

41:56.035 --> 41:58.603
Our stuff <i>
is</i> actually missing.

41:58.646 --> 42:01.649
I mean, maybe if you went over
to Neil's garage...

42:01.693 --> 42:03.695
Ugh....it might all be in there,
but who knows?

42:03.738 --> 42:05.131
Not I!

42:05.174 --> 42:06.480
Y-- No, no, no!
And not you!

42:06.524 --> 42:08.047
I am not going
in Neil's garage.

42:08.090 --> 42:10.005
-I am taking Bill out.
-Whoa, whoa.

42:10.049 --> 42:12.965
Who's Bill, and where
are you taking him?

42:13.008 --> 42:16.011
Bill is what I named our dog.
Where is he?

42:16.055 --> 42:18.753
Oh, uh, that whole
security system wasn't working.

42:18.797 --> 42:21.364
The cameras were blurry,
the dog was a bum,

42:21.408 --> 42:24.280
and the bat broke when Neil
and I were smashing watermelons.

42:24.324 --> 42:25.543
I scrapped all of it.

42:25.586 --> 42:27.022
All of it?

42:27.066 --> 42:28.763
-Even the dog?
-I took him back to my guy.

42:28.807 --> 42:31.026
I expect I'll get
some sort of store credit

42:31.070 --> 42:33.855
once he finds "Bill"
tied to his porch.

42:33.899 --> 42:35.814
You abandoned the dog?

42:35.857 --> 42:38.773
When I left, I gave him
half my bacon, egg, and cheese.

42:38.817 --> 42:41.254
If that's abandonment,
abandon me every morning.

42:42.821 --> 42:45.084
With that insurance money,
I can get the hoodie

42:45.127 --> 42:47.956
that Belichick wore
in the 2017 playoffs.

42:49.741 --> 42:53.048
So, that other hoodie --Keep it, foreigners!

42:53.092 --> 42:55.311
Put another win
on the board!

42:55.355 --> 43:00.360
In the game of life,
it's Kevin 632,

43:00.403 --> 43:03.232
Life 3.

43:03.276 --> 43:05.060
New Belichick Hoodie Day,
baby!

43:05.104 --> 43:08.324
Yay-uh!

43:56.198 --> 43:58.592
Oh, um, excuse me.

43:58.636 --> 44:00.942
Is there a therapist office
in here?

44:00.986 --> 44:03.945
Therapist?

44:03.989 --> 44:05.381
Ah, yeah.

44:05.425 --> 44:07.862
Just, uh, ask for a wash
like Barb gets.

44:07.906 --> 44:09.951
She'll hook you up.

44:09.995 --> 44:11.605
She'll "hook me"...

44:14.086 --> 44:15.653
Oh, it's drugs.

44:33.888 --> 44:35.368
One sec.

44:48.076 --> 44:52.602
Shit.

45:02.787 --> 45:05.572
<i>On the next
"Kevin Can Himself".</i>

45:05.615 --> 45:06.878
Kevin and Alison
together forever.

45:06.921 --> 45:09.881
Seeing you again
makes me feel a little guilty.

45:09.924 --> 45:11.752
Oh, yeah?

45:11.796 --> 45:13.754
You got a special occasion
you want to look nice for?

45:13.798 --> 45:16.148
Jenn, this is Alison.
Alison, my wife, Jenn.

45:16.191 --> 45:18.063
We've actually
met before.

45:18.106 --> 45:20.500
We're in that mutually assured
destruction territory now.

45:21.936 --> 45:23.242
What the hell's
been going on with you?

45:23.285 --> 45:24.591
Something in me
just snapped.
