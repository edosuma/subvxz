what you took from me.

14:20.735 --> 14:21.778
I want her.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.618
-I can't.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.079
-You give me her,

14:31.162 --> 14:32.914
and I won't tell
the authorities about you.

14:32.998 --> 14:34.249
I won't bring you in.

14:34.332 --> 14:36.710
You can live out your days here.

14:47.095 --> 14:50.223
-How do I know?

14:50.307 --> 14:53.977
How can I know
you'll hold up your end?

14:56.980 --> 14:58.857
-What choice do you have?

15:08.783 --> 15:09.993
Oh, well.

15:14.789 --> 15:17.917
-Blue. Blue eyes.

15:20.754 --> 15:24.174
She had blue eyes.

15:26.051 --> 15:28.511
-Blue how?

15:28.595 --> 15:30.764
-Blue like the Mediterranean
at twilight.

15:33.808 --> 15:36.311
Blue like a starling's feathers.

15:39.814 --> 15:44.861
Blue like an aster flower
just moments after bloom.

15:44.944 --> 15:49.074
-She had blue eyes.
-Mmm.

15:49.157 --> 15:52.035
And clumps of mascara.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.037
Always clumps.

15:56.706 --> 16:00.293
And when she looked at you...

16:00.377 --> 16:03.505
when she looked at you,
my God,

16:03.588 --> 16:07.050
-her eyes opened wide.
-Really?

16:07.133 --> 16:09.427
-Yeah. Right.

16:09.511 --> 16:11.721
And she cooed when she saw you.

16:11.805 --> 16:15.141
(chuckles)

16:15.225 --> 16:19.854
Involuntarily, she cooed
when you walked into her room.

16:19.938 --> 16:21.981
She would gasp...

16:22.065 --> 16:25.777
as if she thought how...

16:25.860 --> 16:28.488
how could this boy be
so perfect?

16:28.571 --> 16:33.868
How could I have made
such a beautiful kid?

16:33.952 --> 16:35.829
How could he be mine?

16:35.912 --> 16:38.540
-She'd gasp when she saw me?

16:38.623 --> 16:39.666
-Yeah.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.876
And she smelled like lavender.

16:41.960 --> 16:44.587
-(chuckles)
-It was the detergent she used.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.923
-(chuckles)

16:47.006 --> 16:48.967
-I've always loved the smell of
lavender.

16:49.008 --> 16:49.759
-Mm-hmm.

16:49.801 --> 16:51.886
-She would do this thing.

16:53.930 --> 16:57.642
Whenever she saw me... you...

16:57.726 --> 16:59.769
in the morning,

16:59.853 --> 17:03.898
she would hold out her hand
as if for a handshake,

17:03.982 --> 17:06.776
like... like we were business
partners.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.153
And she would say,

17:08.194 --> 17:12.240
"Nice to make your
acquaintance, Mr. Man."

17:12.282 --> 17:13.825
(chuckles)

17:15.869 --> 17:20.665
And she'd take you
to the playground every day

17:20.749 --> 17:23.710
to feed the ducks and play.

17:23.793 --> 17:26.045
-And there was this...
-Slide.

17:26.129 --> 17:28.631
-Yeah. Big blue slide.

17:28.715 --> 17:32.010
It was like your Everest.

17:32.093 --> 17:35.054
You saw her growing small.

17:35.138 --> 17:38.767
And then you slid down...

17:38.850 --> 17:40.560
-Wrapped her arms?

17:43.438 --> 17:45.148
-And she held you tight.

17:47.108 --> 17:50.487
I don't know what
came over her that day...

17:50.570 --> 17:55.909
but her eyes were watery,
and her little nose...

17:55.992 --> 17:58.161
-Her nose? What...
-Yeah.

17:58.244 --> 18:01.372
Like a button.
Small, red...

18:03.374 --> 18:09.255
And she said,
"I will always catch you, Otto.

18:09.339 --> 18:11.132
I will never let you fall."

18:15.595 --> 18:16.846
-She sounds lovely.

18:18.556 --> 18:19.766
-She was.

18:21.434 --> 18:24.354
She really was.

18:26.064 --> 18:28.441
-And so were you.
-(scoffs)

18:28.525 --> 18:29.984
-A lovely boy.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.864
-Why?

18:34.948 --> 18:36.908
Why'd you take those memories
from that little boy

18:36.991 --> 18:40.036
in that hospital hall
who just lost his mom?

18:54.717 --> 18:56.094
-I had a child once.

18:58.847 --> 19:01.224
A beautiful boy.

19:02.767 --> 19:06.646
During the Stay, I...
I began to think him a nuisance.

19:08.439 --> 19:10.859
An annoyance.

19:10.942 --> 19:15.446
An interruption
to the screens that I loved,

19:15.530 --> 19:17.240
to the devices I cherished.

19:21.369 --> 19:25.498
I made excuses
not to play with him.

19:25.582 --> 19:28.918
Not to help him
with his school.

19:29.002 --> 19:33.590
Not to show him the stars
or tuck him into bed at night.

19:36.593 --> 19:38.636
And then one day...

19:38.720 --> 19:42.724
(sighs)

19:42.807 --> 19:44.267
One day he got sick.

19:47.103 --> 19:50.607
Virus took him in its arms...

19:50.690 --> 19:54.903
and he ailed and glitched and...

19:54.986 --> 19:58.698
begged for breath...

19:58.781 --> 20:00.909
until he was gone.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.914
And the light left my world.

20:09.375 --> 20:16.090
And when he passed,
I roamed the streets for days,

20:16.174 --> 20:17.675
wishing to disappear.

20:19.093 --> 20:20.929
Wishing to die.

20:22.472 --> 20:26.351
Wishing to leave
on a rocket ship or...

20:26.434 --> 20:28.478
stay locked in my Stay

20:28.561 --> 20:31.064
or...

20:31.147 --> 20:32.774
travel to the future...

20:32.857 --> 20:36.527
or... or be punished forever.

20:39.197 --> 20:42.075
Wishing I had seen
my boy for what he was.

20:44.786 --> 20:46.454
Which was the whole world.

20:53.127 --> 20:56.255
I couldn't bear the memories
of him.

20:56.339 --> 20:58.800
So I spiraled and tumbled and...

21:01.594 --> 21:02.929
That's when I started.

21:04.389 --> 21:06.349
Stealing. Thieving.

21:09.894 --> 21:15.191
I needed to stop my heart
from this god-awful bleeding.

21:18.069 --> 21:22.281
I stole the other memories
to rid myself of my own.

21:22.365 --> 21:24.158
I stole from them.

21:25.952 --> 21:30.039
From hundreds of victims.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.333
From you.

21:32.417 --> 21:35.795
A sweet boy, just like my own.

21:35.878 --> 21:42.593
And I just needed to remember
a boy's love for his parent,

21:42.677 --> 21:44.595
so that I could make
myself believe

21:44.679 --> 21:48.474
this is what my boy
must have felt about me.

21:51.602 --> 21:54.856
So I took your memories...

21:54.939 --> 21:56.691
and I watched every one

21:56.774 --> 22:00.445
over and over again.

22:00.528 --> 22:02.071
Sixty years of 'em.

22:02.155 --> 22:04.866
Of you.

22:04.949 --> 22:06.951
Her.

22:07.035 --> 22:08.286
And together.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.542
But as the dementia progressed

22:14.625 --> 22:17.837
and the fog overtook

22:17.920 --> 22:20.006
and the memories grew dim

22:20.089 --> 22:23.426
and I could see
only dark shadows

22:23.509 --> 22:27.180
where people should be,

22:27.263 --> 22:30.641
I realize...

22:30.725 --> 22:33.019
the worst truth of all.

22:35.271 --> 22:37.982
This is what my boy
must have felt

22:38.066 --> 22:40.026
when he looked at me.

22:40.109 --> 22:44.489
A glitching father
whose face he hardly saw.

22:47.075 --> 22:51.245
Whose embrace he never know.

22:53.456 --> 22:55.083
Whose love...

22:58.753 --> 23:00.421
Whose love he never felt.

23:05.551 --> 23:10.431
I see now that I've committed
the same crime twice.

23:12.350 --> 23:15.478
To you and to him.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.858
Robbing a child of his parent.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.780
-Tell me about that last day.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.159
My last day with her.

23:30.243 --> 23:35.206
-Son...
-Tell me. I wanna know.

23:40.545 --> 23:43.005
-It was cold.

23:43.089 --> 23:46.717
You had on a sweater...

23:46.801 --> 23:48.636
and you went in to see her.

23:50.638 --> 23:54.100
And she was lying in bed.

23:54.183 --> 23:57.728
Bald, pale.

23:57.812 --> 23:59.438
Her nose was...

23:59.522 --> 24:02.275
-Red and small like a button.

24:02.358 --> 24:06.529
-You crept toward her and...

24:06.612 --> 24:08.114
as soon as she saw you...

24:08.197 --> 24:13.119
-Her blue eyes opened wide.

24:13.202 --> 24:16.581
Her eyelashes caked
with mascara

24:16.664 --> 24:18.624
wide like this.

24:18.708 --> 24:20.793
-She reached out
her hand to you.

24:20.877 --> 24:24.088
-To shake it as if
we were business partners?

24:24.172 --> 24:27.592
Which in a way we were,
her and me.

24:27.675 --> 24:29.177
-And she said...

24:29.260 --> 24:31.888
-"Pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Mr. Man."

24:31.971 --> 24:33.514
-Exactly so.

24:33.598 --> 24:35.892
Exactly so.

24:37.101 --> 24:38.603
And she held you tight.

24:40.897 --> 24:43.316
Only now it was final.

24:43.399 --> 24:46.277
-She smelled of lavender.

24:46.360 --> 24:47.820
She smelled great.

24:49.947 --> 24:54.202
She pulled you close
like that day on the...

24:54.285 --> 24:56.621
-Big blue slide.
-Mm-hmm.

24:56.704 --> 25:01.250
-She said she'd always be there
to catch me...

25:01.334 --> 25:02.752
even if she was gone.

25:02.835 --> 25:03.961
-That's right.

25:04.045 --> 25:07.215
And her breaths grew fainter.

25:07.298 --> 25:08.633
She pulled you close.

25:12.094 --> 25:13.387
She held you tight.

25:15.848 --> 25:18.935
-And she said...

25:19.018 --> 25:21.729
Tell me what she said.

25:23.606 --> 25:26.859
-She said, "My boy...

25:26.943 --> 25:32.073
it has been the privilege
of my life to be your mom.

25:32.156 --> 25:34.659
I'm sorry we've had such
a short visit together.

25:37.078 --> 25:42.333
And as the years go on,
these moments together may fade.

25:42.416 --> 25:44.418
But it's okay.

25:44.502 --> 25:48.130
It's okay if you forget me."

25:48.214 --> 25:49.048
-No.

25:49.090 --> 25:51.592
-"It's okay if
you forget me, Otto.

25:51.634 --> 25:53.427
'Cause you never can.

25:53.511 --> 25:57.056
You are literally
made up of me.

25:57.139 --> 25:58.599
(chuckles)

25:58.683 --> 26:01.477
I'm in every fiber,
every eyelash

26:01.560 --> 26:03.437
and follicle and cell,

26:03.521 --> 26:06.983
like the stars and the sky
and the sand and the sea.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.485
I'll always be with you.

26:09.568 --> 26:14.365
And you don't need to remember
for it to be true,

26:14.448 --> 26:16.867
for I will for you."

26:22.456 --> 26:25.835
And as you held her close,

26:25.918 --> 26:28.421
you looked at the respirator
beside her bed,

26:28.504 --> 26:32.591
the machine that hummed
and glowed with a...

26:32.675 --> 26:35.553
-Green light.
-Yeah.

26:35.636 --> 26:39.348
Until her breaths ceased.

26:39.432 --> 26:40.850
And she grew still.

26:43.769 --> 26:46.731
And the green light,
too brief, went out.

26:53.988 --> 26:58.075
A memory isn't simply
a thing you have.

26:58.159 --> 26:59.493
It's a promise.

27:02.204 --> 27:04.915
It's a vow to the one you love.

27:04.999 --> 27:07.960
Remembering is a search.

27:08.044 --> 27:10.921
And you found her again, son.

27:16.886 --> 27:18.512
She would be so proud.

27:23.059 --> 27:24.352
(sighs)

27:27.688 --> 27:31.442
I am sorry.

27:31.525 --> 27:36.947
I'm so sorry for what
I've taken from you.

27:37.031 --> 27:38.532
For what I've done.

27:42.203 --> 27:43.788
(exhales)

27:51.545 --> 27:53.381
-It's time, Stuart.

27:56.467 --> 27:57.968
-For what?

27:58.052 --> 28:00.054
-I have to take it with me.

28:00.137 --> 28:02.932
-The memories?

28:03.015 --> 28:05.184
The green light?

28:05.267 --> 28:07.019
-That's right.

28:07.103 --> 28:09.605
-Oh, you... you said...
-I said

28:09.688 --> 28:12.108
I wouldn't tell
the authorities about you.

28:15.694 --> 28:19.615
-No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

28:19.698 --> 28:20.783
No, no, please, please.

28:20.866 --> 28:23.244
No, don't take them.

28:23.327 --> 28:26.664
Don't send me back there.
Please.

28:28.082 --> 28:30.418
-I have to, Stuart.
-Please.

28:30.501 --> 28:31.752
-You know I do.

28:36.507 --> 28:41.846
-Can I ask just one small favor?

28:41.929 --> 28:44.557
-You don't deserve a favor,

28:44.640 --> 28:46.684
however small.

28:49.812 --> 28:52.481
You've hurt so many people.

28:52.565 --> 28:54.150
-I know.

28:54.233 --> 28:58.904
But can't you just leave me
one... one memory?

28:58.988 --> 29:00.823
Just one.

29:02.616 --> 29:03.659
Please.

29:07.163 --> 29:08.330
-Which memory?

29:10.583 --> 29:11.709
Of your boy?

29:13.544 --> 29:16.005
-Those memories are
all corrupted, I'm afraid.

29:16.088 --> 29:17.631
-So which one?

29:22.219 --> 29:23.679
-I don't know.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.181
I don't...

29:40.237 --> 29:43.741
-Hey, Stuart.
-Yeah.

29:46.285 --> 29:49.246
-Would you show me
what it felt like?

29:49.330 --> 29:50.873
-What?

29:50.956 --> 29:52.750
-Her hug.

30:14.939 --> 30:16.190
You know, Stuart...

30:20.653 --> 30:21.987
I imagine this is what your boy

30:22.029 --> 30:24.156
must have thought your hugs felt
like too.

30:27.701 --> 30:29.453
How about this one, Stuart?

30:31.830 --> 30:33.749
How about this memory?
