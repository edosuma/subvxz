01:03.886 --> 01:05.886
I simply cannot believe you're
going to go through with this, sir.

01:05.921 --> 01:08.887
I'm a man, Kryten, with a man's
urges, and a man's desires.

01:09.890 --> 01:11.886
Well what about an ice-cold shower, sir?

01:13.884 --> 01:18.055
I've used up this year's water
supply with ice-cold showers, Kryten.

01:18.056 --> 01:21.320
I was looking at the log
this morning: a 112 gallons!

01:21.321 --> 01:24.886
If I carry on like this my
libido's gonna cause a drought.

01:24.921 --> 01:25.884
You think this is the answer?

01:26.884 --> 01:27.882
Look, I know how it may
look from the outside -

01:28.887 --> 01:32.990
Going into an AR simulation with a book of
cheats, and seducing the Queen of Camelot?

01:34.291 --> 01:35.068
Words fail me.

01:35.069 --> 01:36.902
It's quite the most unchivalrous
thing I've ever heard in my life!

01:37.896 --> 01:38.898
Are you my faithful manservant or what?

01:39.897 --> 01:41.238
I'm ashamed to be with you, sir!

01:41.239 --> 01:44.447
I haven't been this embarrassed since
I was loosening my adjustment screws,

01:44.448 --> 01:46.896
and my entire groinal box
dropped into Mr. Rimmer's soup.

01:56.115 --> 01:59.741
Is there any man, across the length
and breadth of our great land,

01:59.742 --> 02:02.122
that dare challenge
the King's best knight?

02:05.118 --> 02:06.115
I do, sir!

02:07.111 --> 02:07.911
And you are, sir?

02:08.115 --> 02:09.113
Lister, of Smeg.

02:11.110 --> 02:16.112
Good knight, do you accept this
challenge from... 'Lister of Smeg'?

02:17.111 --> 02:18.109
I do, my King.

02:19.110 --> 02:21.108
And what do you claim if the
victory should be yours, my lord?

02:22.108 --> 02:25.111
I claim nothing, sire. Serving
the king is reward enough.

02:28.114 --> 02:32.235
And you... 'Lister of Smeg',
what prize do you claim

02:32.236 --> 02:35.112
if you should defeat my best knight?

02:36.107 --> 02:40.110
I claim, my lord, a night and a
day in the bed of your good lady...

02:44.107 --> 02:46.109
'A night and a day in
the bed of my good lady'?

02:49.105 --> 02:50.110
We accept the challenge...

02:52.108 --> 02:53.107
Do we?

02:54.109 --> 02:55.108
Oui, we do.

02:59.110 --> 03:01.109
My lady, I think we should
discuss this matter in private...

03:03.109 --> 03:07.109
Do you not have faith in your good knight,
to cut this dog down where he stands?

03:08.114 --> 03:10.111
I do! Sort of.

03:11.109 --> 03:12.107
Then we accept.

03:14.109 --> 03:18.114
Good knight - bring me this knave's
manhood on a silver platter

03:19.049 --> 03:20.045
'Ey, steady!

03:21.046 --> 03:24.045
then disembowel him, and
feed his innards to the crows!

03:29.507 --> 03:30.511
This is worse than playing away at Leeds!

03:38.514 --> 03:44.507
When mah lace 'ankerchief, flutters onto
ze ground, the challenge shall commence!

03:45.509 --> 03:48.508
I just lurve that accent... rrrrrrarrr!

03:49.510 --> 03:53.505
If I were you, Mr. Galahad, sir, I'd
concentrate on memorising your cheats book.

04:09.509 --> 04:13.508
Cheat one: codeword 'steadcheat' Haa!

04:29.507 --> 04:31.510
I claim my prize, my lord.

04:45.503 --> 04:48.137
You are the scurviest
knave in Christendom!

04:48.138 --> 04:52.506
And I swear to you: your scheme to
seduce my fair lady will not succeed!

04:56.502 --> 04:59.504
Cheat 2: codeword 'chastitycheat'

05:10.506 --> 05:12.503
Scum! Absolute scum.

05:14.504 --> 05:18.415
If he that calls himself Lister of
Smeg has a grain of honour in his soul,

05:18.416 --> 05:20.501
that tent will part this very instant

05:20.536 --> 05:23.505
and he will return to me my lady,
and beg the King's forgiveness!

05:26.500 --> 05:27.499
Has anybody got any whipped cream?

05:28.499 --> 05:29.502
'Whipped cream'?

05:31.503 --> 05:33.505
Ace, we need to find a dimension close by.

05:34.504 --> 05:35.500
Understood, computer. Prepare to jump.

05:41.505 --> 05:42.502
Hey! What's happening?

05:43.506 --> 05:44.499
Power failure, sir!
Electrics are going down.

05:49.497 --> 05:53.503
The red, green, and blue alert signs are
all flashing! What the smeg is happening?

05:53.538 --> 05:55.504
Well, either we're under attack,
sir, or we're having a disco.

06:03.498 --> 06:05.315
I'm locked out! Everything's dead!

06:06.216 --> 06:07.778
Steering's down, thrusters are down

06:07.779 --> 06:10.499
and we're heading straight for
that ion storm in sector 12!

06:11.502 --> 06:12.501
Morning!

06:13.501 --> 06:14.462
What the smeeee is going on?

06:14.497 --> 06:16.502
A power drain is knocking
out all the generators!

06:17.498 --> 06:18.198
Cause?

06:18.502 --> 06:22.298
An object of such awesome power and
charisma it's flattened all the grids!

06:22.299 --> 06:26.498
At first I thought it was me; turns out
it's some kind of craft Dimension Jumping.

06:26.533 --> 06:27.459
Any ident details?

06:27.494 --> 06:30.361
The last time we came across a
lunatic trying to pull a stunt

06:30.362 --> 06:33.090
like this it was 'Captain Smug
Git' himself: 'Ace Rimmer'.

06:33.091 --> 06:35.495
Dear God, don't make it
be him, I couldn't bear it.

06:35.530 --> 06:38.896
This is the JMC transport ship
'Starbug' opening channels,

06:38.897 --> 06:40.494
please identify yourselves.

06:41.503 --> 06:44.499
Well, I said I'd be back for breakfast,
how're those kippers doing, fellas?

06:46.217 --> 06:50.220
Ace, buddy! How're you doin'?

06:51.213 --> 06:54.702
All the better for seeing you, Cat old
friend. Is that a new suit you're wearing?

06:54.703 --> 06:57.085
Why, it's sharper than a
page of Oscar Wilde witticisms

06:57.086 --> 06:58.702
that have been rolled up into a point,

06:58.703 --> 07:01.211
sprinkled with lemon juice
and jabbed into someone's eye.

07:02.212 --> 07:04.215
Wow, that's sharp. Thanks buddy!

07:05.215 --> 07:09.218
According to the log we're down to our
last 3000 vomit bags. It'll never be enough.

07:14.562 --> 07:16.523
Ace - good to see ya! How're you doing?

07:16.558 --> 07:19.255
Never better, Skipper.
Sorry to DJ so close;

07:19.256 --> 07:20.479
ship's computer made a
minor calculation error.

07:20.480 --> 07:23.557
Poor thing's got a bit of a crush on
me; it doesn't know what day it is.

07:23.592 --> 07:25.527
So, what have you been up to, sir?

07:25.562 --> 07:28.659
Nothing special. Saved a couple of
universes, overthrown a few dictatorships,

07:28.660 --> 07:31.558
turned down a heapful of marriage
proposals, and had my highlights done.

07:32.558 --> 07:33.559
What a guy!

07:34.556 --> 07:35.559
Off!

07:39.559 --> 07:41.557
So, what's new with you chaps? Arnie?

07:42.248 --> 07:44.214
I've been pretty damn busy myself, actually.

07:44.249 --> 07:47.037
I'll take you to the guest
quarters, bud; we can catch up!

07:47.238 --> 07:49.249
For starters you can tell
me the name of your stylist!

07:50.252 --> 07:53.214
Thanks Cat, but with your driving
skills, you should be at the helm.

07:53.249 --> 07:58.247
Incidentally, it's AstroCuts, in the Theta
sector, Dimension 24. Ask for Alfonce.

08:00.254 --> 08:01.245
Yeoooowww, yeeah!

08:03.248 --> 08:04.250
Arnie, up for a stroll?

08:05.246 --> 08:08.300
Thanks for the offer, but I'd rather
smear my genitalia with fish paste

08:08.301 --> 08:10.251
and dangle them in a
pool of hungry piranhas.

08:11.246 --> 08:13.246
I'll take that as a 'no', then.

08:14.253 --> 08:15.245
Oh Rimmer, go with him.

08:16.245 --> 08:16.945
I don't want to.

08:17.246 --> 08:18.246
But, sir, he wants you to.

08:19.247 --> 08:21.800
And I want him to choke to
death on his own smug gittyness.

08:21.801 --> 08:23.246
We don't always get what we want.

08:24.245 --> 08:27.246
But Rimmer, he asked for you. He
obviously feels some sort of bond.

08:28.251 --> 08:30.007
The only 'bonding' I want to do with him

08:30.008 --> 08:32.246
involves a tube of superglue
and a rabid hamster!

08:37.248 --> 08:39.386
Oh all right. I'm going. God!

08:45.288 --> 08:47.249
Okay, allow me to show you
to your sleeping quarters.

08:47.250 --> 08:49.283
They're about fifty yards
down there on the right. Bye!

08:53.285 --> 08:56.286
I think - I may need some help here, Arn.

09:03.002 --> 09:06.293
I knew it! You pretend to be a
big shot while they're around,

09:06.294 --> 09:10.328
but as soon as no-one's watching you're
as butch as an ice-skater's friend.

09:10.729 --> 09:12.240
What's the problem? Travel sickness?

09:12.741 --> 09:15.000
The strap on your padded
codpiece too tight again?

09:15.999 --> 09:21.002
Sorry to sound so damn melodramatic
but, I'm afraid I'm... on the way out.

09:22.003 --> 09:22.966
You're what?

09:23.001 --> 09:26.997
About to visit the great airfield in the
sky. Lose all my breathing privileges.

09:27.032 --> 09:29.004
You're dying?

09:29.997 --> 09:33.001
You've got it, Arn. Your brain moves
quicker than a nun's first curry.

09:35.000 --> 09:35.998
You're really dying?

09:38.002 --> 09:43.995
Arnie, I want you to
become the next Ace Rimmer.

09:48.002 --> 09:48.802
I mean it, Arn!

09:49.001 --> 09:49.998
Are fevered rantings one of your symptoms?

09:52.002 --> 09:53.890
The universe needs a chap to look up to.

09:53.891 --> 09:57.996
Someone to right wrongs, just generally be
brave, handsome and all-round magnificent.

09:58.997 --> 10:00.497
And you think, I'm your man?

10:00.532 --> 10:01.962
It's your destiny, Arnie.

10:01.997 --> 10:04.996
What, to wind up looking like
a reject from a Gay Pride disco?

10:06.002 --> 10:08.798
You're just afraid, old son.
Afraid that you're not good enough.

10:09.299 --> 10:10.496
You've always wanted to play the hero.

10:10.998 --> 10:13.999
I'm not you. I think we
established that in your last visit.

10:14.994 --> 10:16.999
I'm not the Ace you met last time, Arnie.

10:19.999 --> 10:23.598
He caught the business end of
a neutron tank in Dimension 165.

10:24.499 --> 10:25.998
I'm a hard light
hologram, just like you.

10:26.994 --> 10:27.962
Ace is dead?

10:27.997 --> 10:30.995
I took over from him, and I
want you to take over from me.

10:35.994 --> 10:37.998
My god! What *is* that stuff?

10:38.248 --> 10:41.915
Light Bee's been hit pretty
bad, it's a power leakage.

10:41.916 --> 10:45.116
Electro-magnetic radiation;
I haven't got long.

10:46.017 --> 10:48.612
About the time I usually
like to spend making love,

10:48.613 --> 10:53.249
say, 12 hours, maybe less. After
that I'll be too weak to train you.

10:56.249 --> 10:57.252
What do you say?

11:06.252 --> 11:09.952
It's part of the legend, I'm not
the first Ace, not even the second.

11:09.953 --> 11:13.171
There have been, well, let's
just say 'more than a couple'.

11:13.172 --> 11:17.532
As one Ace dies, he recruits his
replacement from a parallel dimension;

11:18.033 --> 11:20.249
we all start off as caterpillars
and turn into butterflies.

11:20.284 --> 11:23.006
We're talking about a man who,
at the first sight of danger,

11:23.007 --> 11:25.192
cowers under tables with
a colander on his head.

11:26.197 --> 11:28.158
Skipper, you can't judge
a book by its cover.

11:28.193 --> 11:31.196
And you can't confuse Rimmer with a
book; for a start a book's got a spine.

11:32.195 --> 11:35.198
Let me train him, that's all I
ask. Talk to him; persuade him.

11:44.192 --> 11:46.193
What is it? What's the joke?

11:46.228 --> 11:47.193
Nothin', nothin'.

11:49.192 --> 11:50.858
Well clearly it's not 'nothing'.

11:51.359 --> 11:54.191
Clearly you've just heard
something terribly amusing, clearly.

11:55.194 --> 11:56.626
It's just that Ace
has just told me about

11:56.627 --> 11:58.194
trying to get you to
be the next Ace Rimmer.

12:00.198 --> 12:03.085
Yes, sadly I've got to
sort out my shoe collection,

12:03.086 --> 12:05.195
or I'd have jumped at it like a shot.

12:05.230 --> 12:08.190
It's just, you, y'know? The
next Ace... The very idea.

12:10.195 --> 12:11.193
It's not so ridiculous, Lister!

12:12.192 --> 12:14.867
Other versions of me have
turned into him.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.284
In fact, if I wasn't
needed around here so badly,

12:17.285 --> 12:19.189
I think I'd very likely
take him up on it.

12:19.417 --> 12:23.512
Rimmer, don't take this the wrong
way, but how could you be the next Ace?

12:23.513 --> 12:27.552
I mean, you're a gutless, spineless,
gormless, direction-less, neurotic,

12:27.553 --> 12:30.319
underachieving, sniveling,
cowardly pile of smeg.

12:30.320 --> 12:34.413
No offence, but get real, man; most
eunuchs have got more balls than you.

12:36.411 --> 12:40.097
Well *that*, my fine, madras-guzzling
friend, is where you are wrong,

12:40.098 --> 12:43.414
because I've taken Ace up on
his offer, and training begins...

12:44.416 --> 12:45.413
.right now.

12:59.412 --> 13:00.414
Er, why have you brought me here?

13:01.411 --> 13:04.559
Take a look around, Arnie.
The plateaux, the summit.

13:04.560 --> 13:07.410
This is where you must
be to become Ace Rimmer.

13:07.445 --> 13:10.413
No, this where you must be
to become Maria Von Trapp.

13:12.414 --> 13:16.872
Just concentrate! Feel the wind
on your face; *be* the wind, Arnie.

13:16.873 --> 13:20.150
Unleash the wild power
you know lurks inside you.

13:20.151 --> 13:24.410
Be the cougar running free and
unfettered through the mountains.

13:25.409 --> 13:26.109
Be the what?

13:26.408 --> 13:28.412
Come on, man, you can do it, concentrate!

13:29.408 --> 13:32.409
See the cougar, Arnie?
It's you; can you see it?

13:37.410 --> 13:38.488
Err, sort of.

13:45.485 --> 13:48.488
Oh, I'll never be Ace! We
tried, we failed! I give up.

13:51.486 --> 13:52.986
All your life you've given up.

13:53.021 --> 13:54.486
Well, maybe after more training!

13:56.488 --> 13:59.487
I can't keep up the dog and pony
show any longer. It's now or never.

14:02.184 --> 14:03.084
What's that?

14:03.485 --> 14:04.486
Light Bee Remote.

14:13.492 --> 14:19.484
If you can fool your crew-mates into
thinking you're me, we'll know you're ready.

14:33.220 --> 14:34.217
But I'm not ready!

14:35.213 --> 14:36.211
Try it the other way around.

14:52.212 --> 14:53.211
"The name's Rimmer,"

14:54.216 --> 14:55.213
Oh, this is ridiculous.

14:58.216 --> 15:01.217
Ah, Mr. Ace, sir. Everything okay?

15:02.212 --> 15:04.213
What? Er, yes, Kryten. Krytie.

15:04.248 --> 15:06.180
Uh-huh, yeah, everything's fine.

15:06.215 --> 15:07.210
Are you sure, sir, you
sound a little different?

15:08.211 --> 15:10.212
Errr, could you be more specific?

15:10.247 --> 15:12.214
Er, 67% more weasely.

15:14.212 --> 15:16.380
Eeeeerrrrrrr, sore
throat, er, sore throat.

15:16.381 --> 15:18.695
Er, um, bug going around,
a holographic virus.

15:18.696 --> 15:20.814
But it affects humans
too. Arnie's got it.

15:20.815 --> 15:24.212
I've quarantined him for twenty-four
hours; no one's to go near him.

15:25.210 --> 15:29.510
Ah, I was just wondering, sir: we've
run out of bacofoil about six months ago;

15:29.511 --> 15:33.212
I don't suppose you have a spare
jacket I might roast a chicken in?

15:34.209 --> 15:36.957
Listen, you stupid,
jumped-up little son-of-a...

15:36.958 --> 15:40.209
Ohhhhhhh! Sorry, old friend;
afraid not, catch you later.

15:51.214 --> 15:55.211
I bid you good day, my lord. I come in
search of the knave called 'Lister of Smeg'.

15:57.211 --> 15:59.204
Now wait a minute, old friend,
let's just stay calm, shall we?

15:59.239 --> 16:01.223
Are you one of his household?

16:01.258 --> 16:03.207
Errr, in a manner of speaking...

16:04.204 --> 16:05.209
Then prepare to die!

16:30.204 --> 16:33.208
Let's talk about this shall we, over
a pot of tea and some toasted muffins?

16:40.204 --> 16:43.207
Okay, how about some scones and
clotted cream? Dundee cake? Battenburg?

17:06.200 --> 17:08.202
My God! I did it!

17:29.341 --> 17:31.340
So far -

17:32.342 --> 17:33.339
so good.

17:37.340 --> 17:39.470
I did it! That's the most
heroic thing I've done

17:39.471 --> 17:42.339
since I set fire to Stinky Bateman's
turn-ups in third from prep!

17:43.344 --> 17:47.117
Well done, Arnie; you've done us proud.

17:50.718 --> 17:53.340
Smoke me a kipper... I'll be back for...

18:01.338 --> 18:04.338
What's happenin', bro? What's
happened to goalpost head?

18:05.338 --> 18:10.305
No, you don't understand.
It's not me, it's him.

18:10.340 --> 18:13.346
Sir, you're in shock. The trauma
has made you speak like Mr. Rimmer.

18:13.381 --> 18:14.337
What happened?

18:24.627 --> 18:28.630
Ah, one of them knights has escaped
from the AR machine. It's killed Rimmer.

18:29.628 --> 18:30.629
*Isn't that right, Ace*?

18:39.626 --> 18:42.632
We should give Rimmer a decent send-off,
y'know. It's the least he deserves.

18:43.626 --> 18:44.631
I just can't believe it.

18:45.632 --> 18:48.593
Neither can I. I was only
insulting him just this morning.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.928
Poor Mr. Rimmer. I
haven't felt this wretched

18:50.929 --> 18:53.529
since Spare Head #3 told
me the others held a poll,

18:53.530 --> 18:55.630
and voted me the
'big-eared, ugly one'.

19:05.629 --> 19:08.626
Heyy. Decided what you're gonna do?

19:09.625 --> 19:13.624
I thought I'd stick around here for a bit.
"Get the hang of the character, as it were".

19:16.427 --> 19:17.127
What's that?

19:17.633 --> 19:22.122
Ace asked me to fit it. Said it would take
his coffin to its 'final resting place',

19:22.123 --> 19:24.047
alongside all the other Ace Rimmers.

19:24.748 --> 19:27.627
He's left some more beacons behind
for the Ace's that follow you.

19:28.627 --> 19:32.258
I'm getting cold feet, Listy. I'm
not sure I can go through with it.

19:32.259 --> 19:33.626
Leave, I mean. Be Ace.

19:34.625 --> 19:36.592
You heard what he said; it's your destiny.

19:36.627 --> 19:39.622
It's my destiny to be a
smug, self-satisfied git?

19:41.628 --> 19:43.509
Okay, so he was a bit full of himself,

19:43.510 --> 19:46.430
but you can be a different
*kind* of Ace, it's up to you.

19:47.731 --> 19:50.263
Look, he said if you got cold
feet we should follow the coffin.

19:50.264 --> 19:52.622
He said it might make
you change your mind.

19:55.899 --> 20:00.063
We are gathered here today to say
our final farewells to Mr Rimmer.

20:00.064 --> 20:03.111
On occasion he was a
small-minded, bureaucratic,

20:03.112 --> 20:05.661
incompetent, cowardly little person, er,

20:05.662 --> 20:07.900
but he also had his good qualities.

20:08.899 --> 20:09.901
Those *were* his good qualities!

20:10.898 --> 20:15.896
To say something about the finer side of his
nature, I'd like to turn now to Mr Lister.

20:26.899 --> 20:31.238
Alexander the Great's chief eunuch
has finally joined his master.

20:31.239 --> 20:34.395
The man who kept his
underpants on coat-hangers

20:34.396 --> 20:38.405
and sewed name labels into his
ship, issue condoms has gone.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.956
Life will never be the same.
We have lost the finest,

20:41.957 --> 20:45.040
the most dedicated
vending machine repair man

20:45.041 --> 20:49.894
the Space Corps - no, no -
the universe has ever known.

20:50.495 --> 20:52.585
No one ever pressed for a Coke, and got

20:52.586 --> 20:55.533
oxtail soup and orange juice
by mistake on his shift,

20:55.534 --> 20:57.301
well, actually, that's not true:

20:57.302 --> 20:59.887
we all did but what the
smeg, this is his eulogy.

20:59.888 --> 21:03.041
He didn't have very many friends,
but those that he did have

21:03.742 --> 21:09.896
were with him at the end. Even Rachel,
who I suppose in many ways is his widow.

21:15.636 --> 21:16.536
See ya smeg 'ead.

21:16.632 --> 21:17.603
Later, bud.

21:17.638 --> 21:19.632
Goodbye Mr. Smeeee Heeee.

21:21.634 --> 21:22.632
Bye, Ironballs.

21:25.636 --> 21:30.151
Finally this: When Rimmer
originally died aboard Red Dwarf,

21:30.152 --> 21:34.522
Holly brought him back as a hologram,
to keep me sane, never an easy task.

21:35.023 --> 21:41.068
He succeeded spectacularly, and for
this accomplishment, we award him this:

21:41.369 --> 21:46.633
Kryten, place First Officer Rimmer's
decoration into the coffin.

21:46.668 --> 21:47.368
Right away, sir.

21:53.634 --> 21:56.629
Gentlemen: First Officer Rimmer.

21:58.627 --> 22:00.630
First Officer Rimmer.

22:57.625 --> 22:58.625
All those Rimmers...

22:59.627 --> 23:03.877
They all did it. They all
became Ace; passed on the flame.

23:05.578 --> 23:07.623
Are you really gonna be
the one to break the chain?

23:11.627 --> 23:12.627
It's been a blast, fellers.

23:14.623 --> 23:15.423
Bye, man.

23:15.622 --> 23:16.322
Bye, dude.

23:16.625 --> 23:17.629
Au revoir, Mr Ace, sir.

23:19.622 --> 23:23.627
Stoke me a clipper, I'll be
back for Christmas. Whatever.

23:32.630 --> 23:34.624
Just had to say one last goodbye!

23:42.224 --> 23:43.324
Seeya, Davey boy.

23:43.620 --> 23:44.623
Yeah, good luck, man...
