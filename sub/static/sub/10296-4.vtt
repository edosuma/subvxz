Time to torture me.

Let's hear the pitter-patter
of little feet,

01:23.501 --> 01:28.300

of greedy little hands.

01:28.300 --> 01:29.801
What's this?

the night someplace

house to myself.

02:01.667 --> 02:03.167
It's like I died
and went to--

02:03.167 --> 02:04.534
Hi, Al.

02:04.534 --> 02:06.701
Hell.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.834
How was your day, honey?

02:09.834 --> 02:11.801
Up till now, great.

02:11.801 --> 02:13.467
Today will go down
in history

02:13.467 --> 02:15.267
as the day
that nothing went wrong.

02:15.267 --> 02:17.868
First, I caught all the green
lights to and from work.

02:17.868 --> 02:21.467
Then, I heard three good songs
in a row on the oldies station.

02:21.467 --> 02:24.801
Best of all, some fat woman came
in the store and yelled at me,

02:24.801 --> 02:29.334
then she went out
and fell right on her ass.

02:29.334 --> 02:33.501
And tonight, the Cubs,
and you, you're going out.

02:33.501 --> 02:34.534
No, I'm not.

02:34.534 --> 02:36.133
We were going to have
a Tupperware party

02:36.133 --> 02:37.367
over at Mrs. Zimmerman's house,

02:37.367 --> 02:41.033
but the store was out of x-rated
tapes, so I came home.

02:42.634 --> 02:45.601
You know, Al,
since the kids are both gone,

02:45.601 --> 02:49.834
I was thinking maybe
we could fool around.

02:49.834 --> 02:56.267
Peg, if we do that now, your
birthday just won't be special.

02:56.267 --> 02:57.901
Come on, honey.

02:57.901 --> 03:01.868
Ah, I got to say no,
but here's an idea.

03:01.868 --> 03:05.200

03:05.200 --> 03:07.834
Got to say no,
but how about this?

03:07.834 --> 03:09.834
Sex for potato chips.

03:09.834 --> 03:11.701
I got to say no.

Well, what the hell.

03:15.767 --> 03:20.634
This'll last longer
than sex, anyhow.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.634
Where's the chips?

03:22.634 --> 03:24.601
Probably at the store.

I thought you were
staying out someplace?

03:38.300 --> 03:41.067
Well, I was, but Robby's
mom came home in a bad mood.

03:41.067 --> 03:44.667
She said something about
"no movies, no Tupperware."

to the Volvo, the baby Benz,

and the BMW three series.

06:14.701 --> 06:19.367
Which would you get
if you had any money at all?

06:19.367 --> 06:21.934

is a driver's car,

but if you should happen
to drive into a wall,

06:24.434 --> 06:27.467
the Benz has air bags,
so, uh...

What say I pull
the car around back...

11:21.467 --> 11:24.100
we load it up...

11:24.100 --> 11:25.567
And head for Canada?

11:25.567 --> 11:27.734
Where the dollar
means something.

11:27.734 --> 11:30.300
Call the girls
in about 10 years.

11:31.801 --> 11:32.834
I can't.

11:32.834 --> 11:33.901
Why?

11:33.901 --> 11:35.133
I don't exactly know.

11:35.133 --> 11:36.400
Come on, Steve!

11:36.400 --> 11:39.000
They sell Mercedes
in Canada-- big ones!

11:39.000 --> 11:42.434
And they come with hookers
dressed like college girls.

11:42.434 --> 11:44.801
Come on, Steve.
Get some bags.

11:44.801 --> 11:46.467
I'll toss out
Peg's dry cleaning

11:46.467 --> 11:48.167
and we'll make rooms
in the trunk.

11:48.167 --> 11:50.367
It's not like we're never gonna
see the girls again, right?

11:50.367 --> 11:53.534
Right!
Okay, I'll get the car!

11:53.534 --> 11:56.300
If Wyatt wakes up,
kill him.

11:58.501 --> 11:59.734
Wait a second.

11:59.734 --> 12:02.467
Al, this is insane.

12:02.467 --> 12:03.767
It's wrong.

12:03.767 --> 12:04.901
It's illegal.

12:04.901 --> 12:07.934
Ooh, that's it.
It's illegal.

12:07.934 --> 12:11.400
Aw, come on, buddy.

12:11.400 --> 12:13.734
We've had our fun.
Let's go home.

12:13.734 --> 12:14.734
All right.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.167
You're right.
You're right.

12:16.167 --> 12:19.000
It's all coming back to me now.
Ungrateful redhead, rotten kids.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.567
Yeah.

12:20.567 --> 12:23.133
Yeah, I'm back now,
but what a beautiful memory.

12:23.133 --> 12:25.133
I wish I had
a picture of it.

12:25.133 --> 12:27.567
So I could show my grandchildren
I had all this money,

12:27.567 --> 12:30.300
but their grandmother
spent it all.

12:30.300 --> 12:31.501
I know.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.434
But...

12:33.434 --> 12:36.300
we got our memories.

12:36.300 --> 12:38.100
Let's go, buddy.

12:49.267 --> 12:51.567
Well, I think we should
be proud of your daddy.

12:51.567 --> 12:56.234
He just cost us the only chance
we'll ever have for happiness.

12:56.234 --> 12:57.467
I'll tell you this much--

12:57.467 --> 13:00.868
the man I marry would
have taken that money.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.000
Hey, leave Dad alone.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.133
Don't you think he knows
he made the biggest mistake

13:07.133 --> 13:09.467
of all our lives?

13:09.467 --> 13:12.634
As I said to Steve,
it's illegal and wrong,

13:12.634 --> 13:16.167
and I'll have no part of it.

13:16.167 --> 13:18.534
Al, tell me something,
honey.

13:18.534 --> 13:20.968
When you were in there
with all that money,

13:20.968 --> 13:22.934
what did you
think about?

13:22.934 --> 13:25.567
Well, Peg, I thought
if I did take it,

13:25.567 --> 13:28.100
you and me and the kids
would drive up to Canada

13:28.100 --> 13:29.901
and live the life
we deserve.

13:29.901 --> 13:31.701
Aw, honey.

13:31.701 --> 13:33.100
I know.
I know.

13:34.501 --> 13:36.501
All right, Al, there's
a million dollars missing.

13:36.501 --> 13:38.234
Where is it?

13:38.234 --> 13:40.100
Oh, Al!

13:40.100 --> 13:41.000
All right, Dad!

13:48.334 --> 13:50.267
I can have
everything I want.

13:50.267 --> 13:53.000
I love my daddy!

13:53.000 --> 13:55.601
We all do, dear.

13:55.601 --> 13:58.534
Al, you are scum.

13:58.534 --> 14:00.801
But he can buy
and sell you, buddy.

14:02.634 --> 14:04.968
Steve, listen, you know
I didn't take it.

14:04.968 --> 14:07.634
Now how could I carry
a million dollars?

14:07.634 --> 14:08.868
Those security bonds.

14:08.868 --> 14:10.334
Ten stinking pieces of paper.

14:10.334 --> 14:12.968
You could have put them anywhere
while I was out of the vault.

14:12.968 --> 14:15.667
Security bonds.
Brilliant, Dad.

14:15.667 --> 14:18.767
Those are good in Canada,
aren't they, Al?

14:18.767 --> 14:22.200

a CD player,

14:22.200 --> 14:25.567

chained to my bed.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.467
Listen, Al, Monday when
they check the duty roster,

14:29.467 --> 14:32.334
one word is gonna come
from above: Rhoades.

14:32.334 --> 14:34.767
I'll have one word
for them: Bundy.

14:34.767 --> 14:37.234
Listen, Steve,
I didn't take it!

14:37.234 --> 14:38.434

14:41.801 --> 14:44.501
And don't think I'm serving
time alone, bunkie.

14:44.501 --> 14:46.734
If I'm going to be playing
in the showers with maniacs,

14:46.734 --> 14:48.734
you're gonna be
passing the soap.

14:50.567 --> 14:52.534
I did not take it!

14:52.534 --> 14:54.000
Hello, Debbie?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.767
Remember saying you
wouldn't go out with me

14:56.767 --> 14:58.767
for all the money
in the world?

14:58.767 --> 15:02.868
Let's test that theory,
shall we?

15:02.868 --> 15:05.000
I'll tell you what
I'm going to do.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.701
I'm going to go home,
drink moderately, and pass out.

15:08.701 --> 15:12.067
And when I come to, you're
gonna give the money back,

15:12.067 --> 15:15.901
because I believe, deep down,
that you are an honest man.

15:15.901 --> 15:19.667
So...here I go...

15:19.667 --> 15:22.167
walking through
the door...

15:22.167 --> 15:24.100
to leave you alone
with your conscience.

15:24.100 --> 15:27.267
Peggy, I'm depending on you
to make him do the right thing.

take it, he didn't take it.

for once in your life.

holding out on me, Al.

15:57.767 --> 15:58.767
Uh-uh.

15:58.767 --> 16:00.601

16:02.200 --> 16:05.434
I've even gone
to the bathroom after you.

16:05.434 --> 16:07.467
I've paid my dues, Al.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.300
I've earned that money just
as if I'd taken it myself.

16:10.300 --> 16:13.467
Half of it's mine.

16:13.467 --> 16:17.200

16:43.234 --> 16:45.000
You can fix me breakfast.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.734
What's in it for us?

16:46.734 --> 16:48.367
Right. Why should
I make breakfast

16:48.367 --> 16:50.901
for a man who won't
even cut us in?

16:50.901 --> 16:54.133
Well, okay Peg,
but I'll tell you this,

16:54.133 --> 16:55.734
if a guy did have
a million dollars

16:55.734 --> 16:57.400
he sure wouldn't
share it with someone

his breakfast.

your father, kids.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.601
Why not?
I squeezed it myself.

about Rio, honey.
