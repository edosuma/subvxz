00:13.147 --> 00:15.549
- YEAH? SO?
SHE LOOKS HAPPY.

00:15.583 --> 00:18.319
- IF SHE'S HAPPY, THAT'S--
THAT'S VERY HAPPY.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.388
- WHAT?
SHOULD WE CALL A DOCTOR, RAY?

00:20.421 --> 00:22.423

YOUR HAPPINESS PEAKS AT FIVE.

00:42.610 --> 00:46.114
- CANDY!
HUH, YOU'RE THAT HAPPY?

00:46.147 --> 00:48.349
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU DAYDREAMED ABOUT CANDY?

00:48.382 --> 00:50.251
YOU CAN'T DO THAT
AS AN ADULT.

00:50.284 --> 00:51.352
YOU CAN TRY,
YOU DON'T GET FAR.

00:51.385 --> 00:56.190
CANDY, CANDY--
OH, CAVITIES. CAVITIES!

00:56.224 --> 01:00.794
OH, NO MONEY!
WHO AM I? WHY AM I HERE?

01:00.828 --> 01:03.364
WHAT AM I DOING?
AM I GAY?

01:05.833 --> 01:08.669
SEE?
CANDY, CANDY DOESN'T WORK.

01:08.702 --> 01:10.704

AND TWIN
ALMOST-TWO-YEAR-OLD BOYS.

01:33.161 --> 01:35.496
MY PARENTS LIVE
ACROSS THE STREET.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.431
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:37.465 --> 01:39.867
THE TRUTH IS,
I'D DO ANYTHING FOR MY FAMILY.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.672
AND--DONE.

01:45.739 --> 01:47.408
OH, NO--

02:08.762 --> 02:13.667
[paper tearing]

02:13.701 --> 02:15.403

02:15.436 --> 02:17.771
YOU'RE DRIVING ME
NUTS, FRANK.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.573
[paper tearing]

02:19.607 --> 02:20.574
I SA--

02:20.608 --> 02:22.610
I SAID STOP.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.545
THIS IS
WHO YOU ARE NOW--

02:24.578 --> 02:25.413
TEARING OUT COUPONS

02:25.446 --> 02:27.381
LIKE YOU WERE IN A HOME
FOR OLD LADIES?

02:27.415 --> 02:28.916
- I FIND IT RELAXING.

02:28.949 --> 02:30.351
- OH-HO.

02:31.952 --> 02:33.421

02:33.454 --> 02:34.555

02:34.588 --> 02:37.258
- [laughs]
YOU DON'T EAT FISH STICKS.

02:37.291 --> 02:38.526
I ONCE MADE THEM FOR YOU,
AND YOU SAID,

02:38.559 --> 02:40.261
"NO, THAT'S NOT THE WAY
GOD WANTED FISH."

02:40.294 --> 02:41.929
- YOU NEVER MADE THEM.

02:41.962 --> 02:43.497
- I DID TOO.
- NOT FOR ME.

02:43.531 --> 02:44.698
- FRANK!

02:44.732 --> 02:45.699
- WHEN DID YOU MAKE
FISH STICKS?

02:45.733 --> 02:47.368
- WHEN THEY FIRST
CAME OUT.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.871
[knock on door]

03:16.830 --> 03:18.666

03:18.699 --> 03:20.701
YOU'RE NOT EVEN CLOSE.

03:20.734 --> 03:21.902
WHY DON'T YOU SEE
IF YOU GOT A COUPON IN THERE

03:21.935 --> 03:24.405

03:26.640 --> 03:28.542
- OH, COME ON, MA.
THEY DON'T COME THAT OFTEN.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.444
- OH, NO.

03:30.478 --> 03:33.347
THEY'RE TOO BUSY GALLIVANTING
AROUND THE WORLD.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.283
- WHERE DID THEY GO

03:35.316 --> 03:36.984
MOROCCO?

03:37.017 --> 03:38.319

TRYING TO PROVE?

03:40.354 --> 03:41.822
- THEY'RE SO PRETENTIOUS.

03:41.855 --> 03:42.756
I ALWAYS HAVE TO HEAR

03:42.790 --> 03:45.393
ABOUT HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS
IN CONNECTICUT.

03:45.426 --> 03:47.595
- LOOK, YOU HAVE TO SEE
YOUR IN-LAWS, ALL RIGHT.

03:47.628 --> 03:48.696
THEY'RE GOING TO BE

03:48.729 --> 03:50.364
WHAT, ARE YOU
GOING TO HIDE?

03:50.398 --> 03:52.666
- I GOT A CHAIR NOW
UP IN THE ATTIC.

03:54.402 --> 03:57.671
- COME ON, YOU KNOW HOW
DEBRA IS WITH THIS FAMILY THING.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.039
I KNOW, IT'S INSANE.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.608
BUT, PLEASE, LOOK,
I PROMISE,

04:00.641 --> 04:03.277
IT'LL ALL BE OVER
BEFORE WARREN CAN SAY,

04:03.311 --> 04:05.012
"I BOUGHT
ANOTHER SCULPTURE."

04:05.045 --> 04:07.948
[both laughing]

04:07.981 --> 04:10.284
- HE'S SUCH AN ASS.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.554
- WHAT ABOUT LOIS?

04:13.587 --> 04:15.956
[falsetto]
I PREFER DARK CHOCOLATE.

04:17.458 --> 04:18.826
- ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
SO YOU'LL COME.

04:18.859 --> 04:21.462
YOU CAN FIND NEW THINGS

04:21.495 --> 04:23.331
IT'S FOR DEBRA, REALLY.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.499
- WELL, COULDN'T YOU TELL DEBRA
ONCE AND FOR ALL

04:25.533 --> 04:28.436
IT'S ENOUGH
WITH HER PARENTS?

04:28.469 --> 04:29.970
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

04:30.003 --> 04:32.440
- DON'T YOU FEEL
THE SAME WAY ABOUT THEM?

04:33.707 --> 04:35.343
- NO, MA.
I LIKE THEM.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.345

09:49.923 --> 09:52.660
IT'S A SHAME WE DON'T SPEND
MORE TIME TOGETHER.

09:52.693 --> 09:56.163
- WE WERE JUST
THINKING THE SAME THING.

09:56.196 --> 10:00.768
SO WHY DON'T WE ALL HAVE
DINNER TOGETHER TOMORROW NIGHT?

10:00.801 --> 10:03.103
- HUH?

10:03.136 --> 10:05.906
- WELL, WE HAVE A RESERVATION
AT LE BERNARDOUX.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.875
WE'LL JUST EXPAND IT.
WE'LL ALL GO.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.176
- THAT'S A FOUR-STAR
RESTAURANT.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.711
- NO, NO, NO.
THANK YOU.

10:10.744 --> 10:13.413
WE DON'T GO TO THOSE KINDS
OF PLACES BECAUSE--

10:13.446 --> 10:14.848
WELL, IT'S JUST TOO MUCH.

10:14.882 --> 10:17.184
- I DON'T LIKE
TO GET DRESSED.

10:17.217 --> 10:20.120
- DON'T BE SILLY.

10:20.153 --> 10:23.290
IN FACT, RAY,
BRING YOUR BROTHER.

10:23.323 --> 10:26.226
- OH, BOY.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.928
- NOW, DOESN'T THIS
SOUND LIKE FUN?

10:27.961 --> 10:30.831
OH, COME ON, YOU GUYS.
OUR TREAT.

10:30.864 --> 10:33.834
IT WOULD MEAN
SO MUCH TO US.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.870
- BUT WE'RE JUST
SO VERY BUSY.

10:36.904 --> 10:38.271
- RAY?

10:38.305 --> 10:40.340
- WELL, WE'RE NOT TOO BUSY
FOR OUR IN-LAWS.

10:40.373 --> 10:42.342
YES, YES.
LE BERNARDOUX.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.211
THE WHOLE FAMILY.
TOGETHER.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.946
- GREAT.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.716
- OH, IT'S GOING TO BE
SO THRILLING.

10:49.883 --> 10:52.352
- IT'LL BE MORE FUN
THAN VIETNAM.

11:09.302 --> 11:12.039
- BONSOIR.
WELCOME TO LE BERNARDOUX.

11:12.072 --> 11:14.441
- HOLY CRAP.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.280
- UH, WE'RE WITH
THE WHELAN PARTY.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.115
- YES, YOUR HOSTS
HAVE ARRIVED ALREADY.

11:22.149 --> 11:24.417
I'LL BE GLAD TO TAKE YOU
TO YOUR TABLE.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.086
- AM I GOING TO
HAVE TO TIP THIS GUY?

11:26.119 --> 11:28.288
- NO. WE'LL SEAT OURSELVES,
THANK YOU.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.958
COME ON, LET'S GO.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.259
- WHAT'S WITH YOUR PARENTS?

11:32.292 --> 11:35.095
IT'S LIKE THE FIRST TIME
THEY'VE WORN SHOES.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.396
- RAY.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.834
- WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

11:40.868 --> 11:41.601
- ISN'T THIS
ONE OF THOSE JOINTS

11:41.634 --> 11:43.971
WITH THOSE
DRESSED-UP WAITERS?

11:44.004 --> 11:46.406
- YEAH. WHAT'S WRONG
WITH DRESSED-UP WAITERS?

11:46.439 --> 11:48.776
- THEY GIVE ME
THE WILLIES.

11:48.809 --> 11:49.810
ALWAYS PUTTING YOU
ON THE SPOT.

11:49.843 --> 11:52.012
IT'S LIKE--
AUTHORITY FIGURES.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.080
- AUTHORITY FIGURES?

11:53.113 --> 11:54.281
YOU'RE A POLICE SERGEANT,
OKAY?

11:54.314 --> 11:57.484
YOU OUTRANK THE WAITER.

11:57.517 --> 12:00.020
- YEAH, BUT HOW'S
HE GOING TO KNOW?

12:00.053 --> 12:02.823
- COME ON.
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT. COME ON.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.357
- HI.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.526
- OFFICER ROBERT.
- HELLO.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.061
- HOW ARE YOU?

12:08.095 --> 12:10.397
- HI.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.532
- HELLO, ROBERT.
- HOW ARE YOU?

12:12.565 --> 12:14.534
- HOW'S POLICE WORK
TREATING YOU?

12:14.567 --> 12:15.803
- OH, YOU KNOW.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.004
ONE DAY YOU'RE RESCUING
A PUPPY,

12:17.037 --> 12:18.305
AND THE NEXT DAY

12:18.338 --> 12:20.507
YOU'RE FISHING A SKULL
OUT OF A TOILET.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.880
- GOOD EVENING.
- GOOD EVENING.

12:29.549 --> 12:30.984
- I AM GERARD.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.986
HERE ARE YOUR MENUS.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.187
- OH, EXCUSE ME,

12:34.221 --> 12:36.957
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH
SILVERWARE ON THE TABLE.

12:36.990 --> 12:39.793
WHAT'S ALL
THE SILVERWARE FOR?

12:39.827 --> 12:41.094
- FOR YOU TO EAT WITH,
MADAME.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.830
- OH, NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S TOO MUCH.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.799
OH, NO, LOOK.
I MEAN, THAT'S WASTEFUL.

12:45.833 --> 12:49.269
I GOT FIVE FORKS.
TAKE THREE BACK.

12:49.302 --> 12:50.270
AND ALL THESE PLATES.

12:50.303 --> 12:51.839
THAT MEANS EXTRA WASHING.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.941
GIVE ME YOUR PLATES.
GO AHEAD.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.878
- YEAH, ME, TOO.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.346
I DON'T NEED
ALL THESE GLASSES.

12:59.379 --> 13:02.382
HOW MANY MOUTHS
DO YOU THINK I GOT?

13:02.415 --> 13:03.550
- I HAVE
TOO MANY PARENTS.

13:03.583 --> 13:06.053
COULD YOU TAKE
ONE OF THEM, PLEASE?

13:06.086 --> 13:09.556
- I'LL BE BACK SHORTLY
WITH TONIGHT'S SPECIALS.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.391
- WHAT KIND OF FOOD
DO THEY SERVE HERE?

13:11.424 --> 13:13.226
- I BELIEVE IT'S FRENCH.

13:13.260 --> 13:14.928
- EVER BEEN TO FRANCE?

13:14.962 --> 13:17.430
- OH, NO, NO.
WE'RE NOT WORLD TRAVELERS.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.166
- OH, FRANCE
IS SO LOVELY.

13:19.199 --> 13:20.968
YOU HAVE TO GO.

13:21.001 --> 13:24.104
- I DON'T APPRECIATE
THE FRENCH--

13:24.137 --> 13:26.106
AS A PEOPLE.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.208
I FIND THEM--

13:28.241 --> 13:30.343
ANNOYING.

13:30.377 --> 13:31.845
TRULY.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.548
- YOU'RE AN INTERESTING MAN.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.185
- REMEMBER THAT TIME
IN PROVENCE?

13:38.218 --> 13:41.254
- OH, THIS IS FUNNY.

13:41.288 --> 13:44.424
- WE WERE IN PROVENCE,
AND I ASKED OUR WAITER,

13:44.457 --> 13:46.326
"WHAT ARE ALL THESE
LITTLE HERBS

13:46.359 --> 13:48.295
SPRINKLED
ON EVERYTHING?"

13:48.328 --> 13:50.163
AND THE WAITER SAYS,

13:50.197 --> 13:52.465
"HERBS DE PROVENCE."

13:55.268 --> 13:56.536
- OH, WARREN.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.106
- FRESH BREAD?

13:59.139 --> 14:00.473
- HERE WE GO.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.077
- HEY, LOOK AT THIS.

14:04.111 --> 14:06.546
LOOK AT ALL THAT BREAD,
HUH?

14:06.579 --> 14:09.216
BOY, I'M SO GLAD
WE CAME HERE.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.184
- YOU GOT ANY RYE BREAD?

14:11.218 --> 14:13.420
- NO, SIR, I'M SORRY,
WE DO NOT.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.222
- I LIKE RYE BREAD.

14:15.255 --> 14:16.957
- WELL, THEY DON'T
HAVE ANY, DAD.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.425
- I'LL HAVE A BAGUETTE
OVER HERE.

14:18.458 --> 14:19.893
- YOU GOT
ALL THESE KINDS OF BREADS.

14:19.927 --> 14:20.693
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY RYE BREAD.

14:20.727 --> 14:21.761
RYE BREAD
IS A VERY COMMON BREAD.

14:21.794 --> 14:24.864
WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN
JEWISH PEOPLE COME IN HERE?

14:26.199 --> 14:28.235
- WOULD YOU LIKE TO SPEAK
WITH THE MANAGER, SIR?

14:28.268 --> 14:30.170
- IS HE JEWISH?

14:30.203 --> 14:33.240
- DAD, JUST TAKE
A ROLL, OKAY?

14:33.273 --> 14:35.242
SORRY, MAN.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.310
- HEY, DON'T APOLOGIZE.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.179
THE CUSTOMER
IS ALWAYS RIGHT.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.413
AM I RIGHT?

14:40.447 --> 14:43.283
- I WOULD NEVER ARGUE
WITH YOU, FRANK.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.452
- I DON'T GET THESE PLACES.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.354
- PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO HEAR
TONIGHT'S SPECIALS.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.322
- PLEASE.
- IN ADDITION TO THE MENU,

14:49.356 --> 14:52.159
THE CHEF HAS PREPARED
A CRAB IN A PUFF PASTRY.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.260
IT'S A DUNGENESS CRAB

14:53.293 --> 14:54.962
IN A LIGHT BUTTER
AND GARLIC SAUCE--

14:54.995 --> 14:56.463
- HOW MUCH IS THAT?

14:56.496 --> 14:57.564
- IT'S $32, SIR.

14:57.597 --> 15:00.133
- OHH!
- JEEZALOO!

15:00.167 --> 15:01.468
- NOW, FRANK,

15:01.501 --> 15:04.271
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO LOOK
AT THE PRICES TONIGHT.

15:04.304 --> 15:05.973
- WARREN, WAKE UP,
WILL YOU?

15:06.006 --> 15:09.943
THIS GUY'S GOT
BOTH HIS HANDS IN YOUR POCKET!

15:09.977 --> 15:12.112
- LOOK, COULD WE
HAVE A MINUTE HERE, PLEASE?

15:12.145 --> 15:14.047
- CERTAINLY.
THANK YOU.

15:15.215 --> 15:16.583
- THANKS.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.519
THIS GUY'S REALLY
WORKIN' ME.

15:19.552 --> 15:22.622
- FRANK, I ASSURE YOU,
UH, IT'S OKAY.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.357
WE'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE.

15:24.391 --> 15:27.060
- SO YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHEN YOU'RE BEING TAKEN.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.561
- DAD, NOBODY'S BEING TAKEN,
ALL RIGHT?

15:28.595 --> 15:31.398
CALM DOWN.
JUST TRY TO ENJOY YOURSELF.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.434
- FRANK HAS AN EYE
FOR VALUE.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.603
- YOU'RE REALLY COMFORTABLE
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?

15:36.636 --> 15:39.072
I MEAN,
IT SEEMS SO UNNECESSARY.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.408
- OF COURSE IT'S NOT NECESSARY,
MARIE.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.709
IT'S A LUXURY.

15:42.742 --> 15:47.147
BUT SOMETIMES
A LITTLE LUXURY IS NECESSARY.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.582
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

15:49.616 --> 15:52.085
- SEE, MARIE,
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,

15:52.119 --> 15:56.056
MY FAMILY JUST LIKES
TO TRY AND ENJOY LIFE.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.525
- WELL, I GUESS
WE JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.

15:58.558 --> 16:02.395
- WELL, NOT EVERYONE
CAN UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.598
- WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

16:05.632 --> 16:07.500
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, DAD.
IT'S OKAY.

16:07.534 --> 16:08.301
- YOU TAKING THEIR SIDE NOW?

16:08.335 --> 16:09.569
- I'M--

16:09.602 --> 16:11.304
- IS ANYONE ELSE--

16:11.338 --> 16:13.273
HOT AND COLD?

16:16.176 --> 16:18.411
- MAYBE THIS WASN'T
SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.413
- OF COURSE IT'S NOT
A GOOD IDEA.

16:20.447 --> 16:23.083
IT'S A BAD IDEA.
IT'S A VERY BAD IDEA.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.617
WHAT, AM I THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN SEE THIS?

16:24.651 --> 16:26.286
- RAY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:26.319 --> 16:29.089
- THESE PEOPLE SHOULDN'T BE
AT THE SAME TABLE TOGETHER.

16:29.122 --> 16:30.690
THEY SHOULDN'T BE
IN THE SAME STATE.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.425
MY PARENTS LIKE TO STAY HOME
AND WATCH TV,

16:32.459 --> 16:35.128
AND YOUR PARENTS
HONEYMOON IN CAMBODIA.

16:35.162 --> 16:37.464
- EXCUSE ME.
SRI LANKA.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.431
- WELL, WHO CARES?

16:38.465 --> 16:39.599
- RAY!

16:39.632 --> 16:41.334
- I MEAN I CARE, I CARE, OKAY?

16:41.368 --> 16:42.635
AND I KNOW YOU CARE,

16:42.669 --> 16:44.171
'CAUSE THAT'S THE KIND
OF PEOPLE YOU ARE.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.372
YOU LIKE TO MAKE JOKES
ABOUT HERBS

16:45.405 --> 16:46.739
THAT NOBODY GETS,

16:46.773 --> 16:49.209
AND YOU GO TO FRANCE,
AND YOU GO TO STOMP,

16:49.242 --> 16:51.144
AND YOU GO
TO SOME BASEMENT IN A VILLAGE

16:51.178 --> 16:54.747
TO WATCH A TRANSVESTITE
CARVE A YAM INTO A MONKEY.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.487
- WHY, RAY,

17:00.520 --> 17:03.356
I HAD NO IDEA
YOU FELT THAT WAY ABOUT US.

17:03.390 --> 17:06.693
- I DON'T, I DON'T.
I DON'T FEEL THAT WAY.

17:06.726 --> 17:10.230
I DON'T.
I'M JUST--

17:10.263 --> 17:12.532
I'M--I'M MAKING
CONVERSATION.

17:30.283 --> 17:33.420
- DON'T YOU HAVE TO GO
TO YOUR HOUSE?

17:33.453 --> 17:36.323
- I CAN'T.
I TOOK YOUR SIDE.

17:36.356 --> 17:37.657
I MAY HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL THE RED CROSS TELLS ME

17:37.690 --> 17:39.459
IT'S SAFE TO GO BACK.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.631
BOY, THEY WERE
PRETTY MAD, HUH?

17:44.664 --> 17:45.765
- AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:45.798 --> 17:48.201
WHO COULD BLAME THEM?
- WHAT?

17:48.235 --> 17:50.870
I WAS MORTIFIED,
THE WAY YOU BEHAVED TONIGHT.

17:50.903 --> 17:51.871
- ME?

17:51.904 --> 17:54.207
- YOU BLEW
THE WHOLE EVENING.

17:54.241 --> 17:55.875
WHERE DID YOU LEARN
YOUR MANNERS?

17:55.908 --> 17:57.377
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

17:57.410 --> 17:59.112
- GREAT DINNER, RAYMOND.

17:59.146 --> 18:01.748
I THINK I'LL GO TO MY ROOM
AND CHEW ON SOME JERKY.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.819
- MARIE, COOK SOMETHING,
WILL YOU?

18:06.853 --> 18:10.323
THANKS TO YOUR SON,
WE DIDN'T EVEN GET TO EAT.

18:10.357 --> 18:14.594
- I GOT SOME FROZEN ZITI
AND SOME LEFTOVER TURKEY.

18:14.627 --> 18:18.465
- NOT EXACTLY FOUR-STAR,
IS IT?

18:18.498 --> 18:20.267
- YOU EMBARRASSED US.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.568
- WAIT A MINUTE.
I DON'T GET YOU GUYS.

18:21.601 --> 18:22.835
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO GO.

18:22.869 --> 18:23.903
YOU COMPLAINED
THE WHOLE TIME.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.472
WHAT ARE YOU MAD
AT ME FOR?

18:25.505 --> 18:26.473
- YOU WERE RUDE.

18:26.506 --> 18:27.740
- I WAS RUDE?

18:27.774 --> 18:30.343
- YES. WE DIDN'T
RAISE YOU LIKE THAT.

18:30.377 --> 18:32.545
- YOU DON'T INSULT
YOUR HOST.

18:32.579 --> 18:33.913
- NOT TO THEIR FACE.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.749
WHERE'S YOUR DISCRETION?

18:36.783 --> 18:38.785
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

18:38.818 --> 18:41.254
I ONLY SAID WHAT I SAID
BECAUSE OF YOU TWO.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.755
- WHAT DID WE DO?

18:42.789 --> 18:44.324
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

18:44.357 --> 18:47.194
IT WAS LIKE THE NIGHT
THE HILLBILLIES LANDED.

18:47.227 --> 18:50.163
- ALL I DID WAS TRY
TO SAVE THE MAN SOME MONEY.

18:50.197 --> 18:51.130
- YOU WERE THE ONE

18:51.164 --> 18:54.801
GOING ON ABOUT YAMS
AND TRANSVESTITES, DEAR.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.236
- I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.337
THERE WERE THINGS
ON THAT MENU

18:57.370 --> 19:00.207
I COULD HAVE GONE FOR
RIGHT NOW.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.341
- I THOUGHT YOU KNEW MORE

19:01.374 --> 19:03.543
ABOUT WHAT BEING
A FAMILY MEANT.

19:03.576 --> 19:05.312
I MEAN, WHAT WOULD
HAPPEN TO THE WORLD

19:05.345 --> 19:10.183
IF EVERYBODY TOLD THEIR FAMILIES
WHAT THEY ACTUALLY THOUGHT?

19:10.217 --> 19:12.885
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD THINK
BEFORE YOU SPEAK.

19:19.359 --> 19:22.629
- OHH--I'M A MAN
WITHOUT A COUNTRY.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.646
OH, YOU'RE UP.

19:39.679 --> 19:40.713
- I COULDN'T BELIEVE YOU
TONIGHT, RAY.

19:40.747 --> 19:43.650
YOU WERE SO RUDE.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.753
- GOOD. IT'S UNANIMOUS.

19:46.786 --> 19:47.754
- LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

19:47.787 --> 19:48.921
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY THINGS

19:48.955 --> 19:51.624
I CAN FIND WRONG
WITH YOUR PARENTS?

19:51.658 --> 19:55.194
- OH, THAT'S LIKE ASKING
HOW MANY ROCKS ARE THERE.

19:57.597 --> 19:58.765
- HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF I
MARCHED OVER THERE RIGHT NOW

19:58.798 --> 20:00.400
AND TOLD YOUR PARENTS

20:00.433 --> 20:02.335
ALL THE THINGS THAT I DIDN'T
LIKE ABOUT THEM?

20:02.369 --> 20:05.338
- GREAT.
I'LL GET THE VIDEO CAMERA.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.873
- NARROW-MINDED,
INTRUSIVE,

20:06.906 --> 20:08.775
COMPLETELY INSENSITIVE,

20:08.808 --> 20:10.743
OBLIVIOUS, AND CHEAP.

20:10.777 --> 20:13.413
- OKAY, NOW LET'S DO
MY MOTHER.

20:13.446 --> 20:14.747
- I AM SERIOUS, RAY.

20:14.781 --> 20:15.982
- I KNOW.

20:16.015 --> 20:17.650
- EXCEPT I WOULD NEVER
SAY ANYTHING

20:17.684 --> 20:19.386
BECAUSE THE CLOSENESS
OF THIS FAMILY

20:19.419 --> 20:21.588
IS VERY IMPORTANT
TO ME.

20:21.621 --> 20:24.291
- YEAH. EVENINGS LIKE THIS.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.459
I--LOOK, I'M SORRY.

20:26.493 --> 20:27.960
I'M VERY SORRY. REALLY.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.996
- YES. YOU'RE SORRY.
WHAT ARE YOU SORRY FOR?

20:30.029 --> 20:33.466
- I'M SORRY WE HAVE PARENTS.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.934
- COME ON, RAY.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.369
- I'M SOR--LOOK,

20:36.403 --> 20:37.570
I DIDN'T WANT
TO INSULT THEM.

20:37.604 --> 20:38.871
I WAS EMBARRASSED,
THAT'S ALL.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.740
I WAS EMBARRASSED,
AND I SNAPPED.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.275
I DIDN'T WANT
TO INSULT YOUR PARENTS.

20:42.309 --> 20:44.611
I'M SORRY
I RUINED THE EVENING.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.879
- WHAT ELSE?

20:46.913 --> 20:49.048
- THERE'S A WHAT ELSE?

20:49.081 --> 20:51.017
- YOU'RE GOING TO CALL
MY PARENTS TOMORROW

20:51.050 --> 20:51.951
AND APOLOGIZE.

20:51.984 --> 20:54.421
- YES, OF COURSE.
I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.622
I'D CALL THEM RIGHT NOW,

20:55.655 --> 20:57.357
BUT THEY'RE PROBABLY
AT A MIDNIGHT SHOW

20:57.390 --> 20:59.492
OF MUMMENSCHANZ.

21:04.597 --> 21:05.765
COME ON.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.334
PLEASE, JUST FORGIVE ME,
ALL RIGHT?

21:07.367 --> 21:08.668
I'LL THROW IN
A DINNER FOR TWO

21:08.701 --> 21:12.038
AT LE BERNARDOUX.

21:12.071 --> 21:14.374
- DOES IT HAVE TO BE
WITH YOU?

21:14.407 --> 21:17.310
- YES.
YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME.

21:17.344 --> 21:19.412
HMM? OKAY?

21:19.446 --> 21:20.713
- OKAY.

21:20.747 --> 21:23.350
JERK.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.084
YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY
WORRIED ME TONIGHT, RAY,

21:25.117 --> 21:27.454
IS YOU STARTED
TO REMIND ME OF YOUR PARENTS.

21:27.487 --> 21:30.957
- OH, HEY, THERE'S NO NEED
TO NAME-CALL.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.325
- THE OTHER THING
THAT BOTHERED ME

21:32.359 --> 21:34.527
IS I THINK
I'M A LITTLE BIT LIKE MINE.

21:34.561 --> 21:35.828
- YEAH, BUT, SEE,
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

21:35.862 --> 21:36.863
- WHAT?

21:36.896 --> 21:38.698
- I DON'T MIND YOU.

21:40.099 --> 21:41.701
- I GUESS I DON'T
MIND YOU EITHER.

21:41.734 --> 21:43.436
- HEY, OUR WEDDING VOWS.

21:43.470 --> 21:44.804
- YEAH.

21:47.139 --> 21:50.042
- SO WE JUST MADE UP.
- MMM.

21:50.076 --> 21:53.446
- I THINK IT MIGHT BE TIME
FOR MAKE-UP SEX.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.382
- DOES IT HAVE TO BE
WITH YOU?
