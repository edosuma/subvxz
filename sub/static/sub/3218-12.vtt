WEBVTT

01:14.971 --> 01:16.715
- Any sign of it?
- Nothing.

01:17.934 --> 01:20.094
Sure this is Bela's room?

01:20.688 --> 01:21.804
I'd say so.

01:38.259 --> 01:41.131
<i>Dean? Sweetie, are you there?</i>

01:41.305 --> 01:42.337
Where are you?

01:42.516 --> 01:44.094
<i>Two states away by now. Where?</i>

01:44.268 --> 01:46.144
Where's our usual quippy banter?
I miss it.

01:46.314 --> 01:48.059
I want it back, Bela. Now.

01:48.234 --> 01:50.905
The little pistol, you mean? Sorry.
I can't at the moment.

01:51.072 --> 01:53.611
You understand how many people
are gonna die if you do this?

01:53.784 --> 01:56.027
What exactly is it that you think
I plan to do with it?

01:56.205 --> 01:59.825
Take the only weapon we have against
demons and sell it to the highest bidder?

02:01.255 --> 02:02.584
You know nothing about me.

02:02.757 --> 02:03.872
I know I'm gonna stop you.

02:04.051 --> 02:06.045
Tough words for a guy
who can't even find me.

02:06.222 --> 02:08.346
Oh, I'll find you sweetheart.

02:08.517 --> 02:11.603
You know why? Because I have
absolutely nothing better to do...

02:11.772 --> 02:13.053
than to track you down.

02:13.233 --> 02:14.692
That's where you're wrong.

02:14.860 --> 02:17.068
You're about to be quite occupied.

02:17.239 --> 02:19.233
Did you really think
I wouldn't take precautions?

02:21.412 --> 02:23.323
Hands in the air!
Down on your knees.

02:28.341 --> 02:30.549
- Bitch.
- On the ground. Now.

02:30.720 --> 02:31.752
Do it.

02:31.930 --> 02:33.045
Go! Unh!

02:33.224 --> 02:35.514
Sam and Dean Winchester,
you have the right to remain silent.

02:35.686 --> 02:38.973
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

02:39.150 --> 02:40.859
You have the right to an attorney...

02:41.028 --> 02:43.402
and have an attorney present
during any questioning.

02:43.574 --> 02:47.409
If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be
appointed for you at government expense.

02:47.581 --> 02:49.040
Hi, guys.

02:50.752 --> 02:52.164
It's been a while.

03:09.074 --> 03:10.154
So did you get them?

03:10.326 --> 03:11.786
I asked for all your men.

03:11.954 --> 03:14.031
And you got them.
They went with you on the raid.

03:14.207 --> 03:16.118
Four men. That's all.

03:16.294 --> 03:18.418
Everyone I could drum up
with an hour's notice.

03:18.589 --> 03:21.165
We're a small town, Agent Henriksen.

03:30.609 --> 03:32.104
- What's he in for?
- Drunk and disorderly.

03:32.278 --> 03:33.939
Keys.

03:34.115 --> 03:35.396
Now.

03:37.704 --> 03:39.533
What are you doing?

03:41.169 --> 03:43.578
It is your lucky night, sir.
You are free to go.

03:43.756 --> 03:45.216
What the hell are you doing?

03:45.384 --> 03:46.879
This way.

03:47.554 --> 03:50.176
Agent Henriksen,
you can't just release my prisoners.

03:51.560 --> 03:53.684
Agent Henriksen?

03:54.064 --> 03:57.232
- Look, I get it. You're Mayberry P.D.
- Excuse me?

03:57.402 --> 03:59.397
This isn't how I would do it
if I had my choice.

03:59.574 --> 04:02.197
But a tip's a tip
and we had to move fast.

04:02.370 --> 04:05.823
Look, agent. This ain't my first rodeo.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.493
You've never been to a rodeo
like this before.

04:08.671 --> 04:10.998
You have any idea
who we're about to bring in here?

04:11.175 --> 04:12.456
Yeah, a couple of fugitives.

04:12.636 --> 04:14.963
The most dangerous criminals
you've laid eyeballs on.

04:15.140 --> 04:17.050
Think Hannibal Lecter
and his half-wit brother.

04:17.226 --> 04:20.314
Do you know what these guys do for
kicks? Dig up graves and mutilate corpses.

04:20.483 --> 04:23.271
They're not just killers,
they're Satan-worshipping killers.

04:23.446 --> 04:24.727
So work with me here.

04:24.906 --> 04:27.280
I'll get them out of your hair
and on to Supermax...

04:27.452 --> 04:30.538
<i>and you'll be home in enough time
to watch the Farm Report.</i>

04:31.291 --> 04:32.870
However we can help.

04:34.672 --> 04:36.465
Those men of yours.

04:36.634 --> 04:38.177
Post them at the exits.

04:38.971 --> 04:40.632
Yes, sir.

04:41.976 --> 04:43.519
<i>Reidy. Yeah, Vic?</i>

04:43.687 --> 04:44.719
Bring them in.

04:44.897 --> 04:46.808
Guess we're as ready
as we're gonna be.

04:46.984 --> 04:49.144
<i>Got it. On our way in.</i>

05:07.142 --> 05:09.219
Why all the sourpusses?

05:11.399 --> 05:13.191
I'll show you to the cells.

05:14.195 --> 05:15.774
Hey, hey. Watch the merchandise.

05:17.868 --> 05:20.871
We're not the ones
you should be scared of, Nancy.

05:33.059 --> 05:35.350
- Unh!
- Dean, come on.

05:36.273 --> 05:38.101
All right, all right. Sit?

05:38.527 --> 05:40.070
Yeah.

05:51.213 --> 05:53.208
How are we gonna Houdini
out of this one?

05:53.385 --> 05:54.844
Good question.

06:00.855 --> 06:02.599
It's me. Is Steven in?

06:03.233 --> 06:05.441
Well, get him out of the meeting.

06:12.624 --> 06:14.618
<i>Groves. I got them.</i>

06:14.794 --> 06:16.254
Well, I'll be damned.

06:16.965 --> 06:20.585
I was betting on your headstone reading,
"Couldn't catch the Winchester boys."

06:20.762 --> 06:23.052
- Well, they'll be at Supermax by morning.
- How?

06:23.224 --> 06:24.969
<i>Armored bus loaded with men.</i>

06:25.144 --> 06:27.352
A bus.
What, are you trying to give me an ulcer?

06:27.523 --> 06:29.813
- Look, we're taking every precaution.
- Like the last time?

06:29.986 --> 06:33.155
<i>And the time before that?
Screw that, I'm sending a chopper.</i>

06:33.951 --> 06:34.983
Whatever you think is best.

06:35.161 --> 06:36.537
Damn right, and I'll be on it.

06:36.705 --> 06:38.829
<i>Can't take you losing those boys again.</i>

06:39.000 --> 06:41.540
They have been a primary
thorn in my ass for months.

06:41.713 --> 06:42.828
<i>- So, Victor?
- Yeah?</i>

06:43.007 --> 06:44.799
Glue your eyeballs to
them till I get there.

06:47.806 --> 06:50.810
- There's a chopper on its way.
- But we don't have a helicopter pad.

06:51.229 --> 06:53.472
Then clear the damn parking lot.

07:06.211 --> 07:08.502
You know what I'm trying to decide?

07:08.674 --> 07:11.547
I don't know, whether Cialis
will help you with your little condition?

07:11.721 --> 07:14.011
What to have for dinner tonight.

07:14.559 --> 07:15.970
Steak or lobster?

07:16.645 --> 07:19.352
What the hell. Surf and turf.

07:19.525 --> 07:23.774
I got a lot to celebrate. I mean,
after all, seeing you two in chains?

07:24.241 --> 07:26.995
You kinky son of a bitch.
We don't swing that way.

07:27.163 --> 07:28.706
Now, that's funny.

07:29.542 --> 07:31.785
I wouldn't bust out the melted butter
just yet.

07:31.962 --> 07:34.122
Couldn't catch us at the bank.

07:34.299 --> 07:36.542
Couldn't keep us in that jail.

07:38.931 --> 07:41.091
You're right. Screwed up.

07:41.268 --> 07:44.355
I underestimated you.
I didn't count on you being that smart.

07:44.774 --> 07:45.974
But now I'm ready.

07:46.152 --> 07:48.442
- Ready to lose us again?
- Ready like a court order...

07:48.614 --> 07:51.154
to keep you in a super-maximum prison
in Nevada till trial.

07:51.327 --> 07:54.413
Ready like isolation in a soundproof,
windowless cell so small...

07:54.582 --> 07:57.751
that between you and me,
probably unconstitutional.

07:59.006 --> 08:00.465
How's that for ready?

08:04.348 --> 08:05.678
Take a good look at Sam.

08:05.851 --> 08:08.557
You two will never see each other again.

08:10.024 --> 08:12.184
Aw. Where's that smug smile, Dean?

08:12.779 --> 08:14.571
I wanna see it.

08:16.409 --> 08:19.116
- You got the wrong guys.
- Oh, yeah. I forgot.

08:19.289 --> 08:21.746
You fight monsters.

08:21.918 --> 08:25.670
Sorry, Dean. Truth is your daddy
brainwashed you with all that devil talk...

08:25.842 --> 08:27.800
and no doubt touched you
in a bad place.

08:27.970 --> 08:31.258
- That's all. That's reality.
- Why don't you shut your mouth?

08:31.434 --> 08:33.808
But guess what?
Life sucks, get a helmet.

08:33.980 --> 08:35.688
Because everybody's got a sob story.

08:35.857 --> 08:37.816
But not everybody becomes a killer.

08:44.205 --> 08:46.246
And now I have two less...

08:46.417 --> 08:48.126
to worry about.

08:50.841 --> 08:51.873
Mm.

08:52.552 --> 08:54.427
It's surf-and-turf time.

09:08.203 --> 09:09.318
Steven.

09:09.663 --> 09:11.242
Gentlemen.

09:13.628 --> 09:15.538
What's all this? What can I say?

09:15.715 --> 09:18.801
The FBI didn't invent bureaucracy,
we perfected it.

09:18.970 --> 09:22.176
- You want me to do all this now?
- Sorry. Now, Victor.

09:22.351 --> 09:26.268
I'm gonna go take a good long gander
at our fugitives.

09:48.602 --> 09:49.931
Sam and Dean Winchester.

09:50.355 --> 09:52.645
I'm Deputy Director Steven Groves.

09:53.359 --> 09:54.938
This is a pleasure.

09:55.947 --> 09:57.323
Glad one of us feels that way.

09:57.491 --> 10:00.530
I've been waiting a long time for you two
to come out of the woodwork.

10:26.038 --> 10:29.326
Sorry, I've gotta cut this short.
It's gonna be a long night, fellas.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.551
What the hell was that?

10:41.856 --> 10:43.185
Put the gun down. Wait.

10:43.358 --> 10:45.767
He shot him.
- I didn't shoot him. I didn't shoot anyone.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.939
He shot me.
Get on your knees now.

10:48.116 --> 10:50.739
Okay, okay. Okay, don't shoot, please.
Look, here. Here.

10:50.912 --> 10:52.656
Okay. Okay.

10:53.416 --> 10:57.286
We didn't shoot him. Check the body.
There's no blood. We did not kill him.

10:58.466 --> 11:00.009
Go ahead. Check him.

11:04.601 --> 11:07.557
- Vic, there's no bullet wound.
- He's probably been dead for months.

11:07.731 --> 11:09.523
- What did you do?
- We didn't do anything.

11:09.692 --> 11:12.267
- Talk or I shoot.
- You won't believe us.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.534
He was possessed.

11:15.703 --> 11:19.703
Possessed. Right. Fire up the chopper,
we're taking them out.

11:19.876 --> 11:21.039
Yeah, do that.

11:21.212 --> 11:22.671
Bill.

11:24.842 --> 11:26.883
Bill, you there?

12:08.330 --> 12:10.489
They're dead. I think they're all dead.

12:12.713 --> 12:14.338
What the hell was that? Reidy?

12:15.634 --> 12:17.378
Reidy?

12:18.889 --> 12:20.883
<i>What is going on out there?</i>

12:21.059 --> 12:23.219
<i>Reidy, what the hell was that? Come in.</i>

12:25.149 --> 12:26.893
<i>Talk to me.</i>

12:27.403 --> 12:28.566
<i>Come in.</i>

12:29.741 --> 12:30.773
<i>Talk to me, Reidy.</i>

12:39.297 --> 12:41.706
Hello? My men. Agent Henriksen?

12:41.885 --> 12:44.294
- What's happening?
- I can't get a line. The phones are out.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.143
Henriksen! Four of my men.

12:47.310 --> 12:50.563
The Internet, I... My cell. It's all dead.
How can it all be dead?

13:03.336 --> 13:04.713
Oh, that can't be good.

13:04.881 --> 13:07.171
- Oh, my God.
- No, no. It's okay. It's okay.

13:07.343 --> 13:09.005
We're gonna go.
We're gonna go right now.

13:09.180 --> 13:10.509
- Let's go.
- Nobody's going.

13:10.682 --> 13:13.436
- Everybody calm down.
- Your partner is out there. My men are...

13:13.604 --> 13:16.357
I know. We go out there,
we're asking to die too.

13:16.525 --> 13:17.724
- Don't you get it?
- What?

13:17.902 --> 13:20.858
They're out there and they're
coming in here. This is a siege.

13:21.032 --> 13:24.118
So this might be a good time for you
to lock the doors and the windows...

13:24.287 --> 13:26.745
take a breath,
and deal with this like professionals...

13:26.917 --> 13:29.208
with some sense in their heads.

13:41.899 --> 13:43.525
You okay?

13:45.740 --> 13:46.772
I wouldn't think so.

13:46.950 --> 13:48.908
Nancy, right?

13:49.078 --> 13:52.948
I'm gonna get you through this,
you got my word. You got that?

13:56.716 --> 13:58.923
All right, don't be such a wuss.

13:59.094 --> 14:00.922
What's the plan?

14:01.306 --> 14:03.596
Kill everyone in the station
and bust you two out?

14:03.768 --> 14:07.604
- What are you talking about?
- About your psycho friends, a bloodbath.

14:07.776 --> 14:09.568
Okay, I promise you:

14:09.737 --> 14:13.155
- Whoever's out there is not helping us.
- Look, you gotta believe us.

14:13.326 --> 14:15.653
- Everyone here is in terrible danger.
- You think?

14:15.830 --> 14:17.788
Why don't you let us out
so we can save you?

14:17.958 --> 14:19.418
From what?

14:20.462 --> 14:25.009
You gonna say "demons"?
Don't you dare say "demons."

14:26.473 --> 14:30.343
Let me tell you something.
You should be a lot more scared of me.

14:34.444 --> 14:35.476
How's the shoulder?

14:37.824 --> 14:39.617
It's awesome.

14:41.413 --> 14:42.993
I'll live.

14:43.167 --> 14:45.541
You know, if we get out of here alive.

14:45.880 --> 14:47.920
So you got a plan?

14:52.807 --> 14:53.839
Hey.

14:54.017 --> 14:56.225
Hey. Hey, uh...

14:56.605 --> 14:58.515
Please. Please, we need your help.

14:59.025 --> 15:00.770
It's Nancy? Nancy, right?

15:01.405 --> 15:02.865
Nancy, my brother's been shot.

15:03.033 --> 15:04.362
He's bleeding really bad.

15:04.535 --> 15:06.328
Do you think you could get us a towel?

15:06.497 --> 15:08.704
Please, just one clean towel?

15:10.628 --> 15:13.203
Look. Look at us.
We're not the bad guys. I swear.

15:18.849 --> 15:20.559
Nice try.

15:28.365 --> 15:29.991
Thank you.

15:33.958 --> 15:35.667
It's okay.

15:40.594 --> 15:42.089
Thank you.

15:50.151 --> 15:51.694
Thanks.

15:56.619 --> 15:57.818
AMICl: Let her go! Let her go!

15:57.997 --> 16:00.038
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Okay.

16:00.835 --> 16:01.867
Freak.

16:02.046 --> 16:03.624
You okay, Nance?

16:05.510 --> 16:07.170
Try something again, get shot.

16:07.346 --> 16:10.017
And not in the arm. Okay.

16:16.193 --> 16:17.393
What the hell was that?

16:28.046 --> 16:29.839
We're like sitting ducks in here.

16:30.008 --> 16:31.253
Yeah, I know.

16:31.760 --> 16:33.838
Would it kill these cops
to bring us a snack?

16:34.390 --> 16:36.681
- How many you figure are out there?
- I don't know.

16:36.853 --> 16:39.974
However many, they could be possessing
anyone. Anyone could just walk in.

16:40.442 --> 16:41.723
It's kind of wild, right?

16:42.904 --> 16:45.028
It means, like,
they're coming right for us.

16:45.199 --> 16:46.445
Never done that before.

16:49.790 --> 16:51.582
It's like we got a contract on us.

16:52.878 --> 16:54.753
You think it's because
we're so awesome?

16:54.924 --> 16:56.918
I think it's because we're so awesome.

17:02.185 --> 17:05.058
Well, howdy there, sheriff. Aah.

17:11.241 --> 17:13.319
- Uh, sheriff?
- It's time to go, boys.

17:15.583 --> 17:18.075
Uh, you know what?

17:18.253 --> 17:20.461
We're just comfy right here,
but thank you.

17:21.759 --> 17:23.005
What do you think you're doing?

17:23.178 --> 17:25.752
I'm not gonna sit here and wait to die.
We're gonna run for it.

17:25.932 --> 17:28.686
- It's safer here.
- There's a SWAT facility in Boulder.

17:29.146 --> 17:31.603
- We're not going anywhere.
- The hell we're not.

17:42.376 --> 17:44.002
Stay back.

17:52.309 --> 17:54.932
- Sam, hurry up.
- It's too late.

17:55.106 --> 17:57.349
I already called them.
They're already coming.

18:24.152 --> 18:26.360
Is he...? Is he dead?

18:29.871 --> 18:32.446
Henriksen. Hey.

18:32.625 --> 18:34.370
Is that you in there?

18:44.102 --> 18:45.763
I, uh...

18:47.398 --> 18:48.479
I shot the sheriff.

18:51.155 --> 18:52.816
But you didn't shoot the deputy.

18:59.085 --> 19:00.959
Five minutes ago I was fine and then...

19:01.422 --> 19:04.424
Let me guess.
Some nasty black smoke...

19:04.593 --> 19:06.088
jammed itself down your throat?

19:08.517 --> 19:10.476
You were possessed.

19:11.522 --> 19:14.441
Possessed, like possessed.

19:14.610 --> 19:16.604
That's what it feels like. Now you know.

19:17.782 --> 19:20.108
I owe you the biggest I-told-you-so ever.

19:33.266 --> 19:34.298
Officer Amici.

19:35.603 --> 19:37.062
Keys.

19:43.699 --> 19:44.980
All right.

19:45.286 --> 19:47.576
So how do we survive?

20:05.944 --> 20:07.605
That's nice. It's not gonna do much good.

20:07.781 --> 20:09.739
We got an arsenal here.

20:10.118 --> 20:12.741
You don't poke a bear with a BB gun.
It's just gonna make him mad.

20:12.914 --> 20:15.952
- What do you need?
- Salt. Lots and lots of salt.

20:16.127 --> 20:17.788
- Salt?
- Is there an echo in here?

20:19.132 --> 20:21.589
There's road salt in the storeroom.

20:21.761 --> 20:23.222
Perfect. Perfect.

20:23.390 --> 20:26.013
We need salt at every window
and every door.

20:31.987 --> 20:33.980
How you holding up, Nancy?

20:34.240 --> 20:35.783
Okay.

20:37.328 --> 20:42.457
When I was little, I would come home
from church and talk about the devil.

20:42.629 --> 20:44.919
My parents would tell me
to stop being so literal.

20:47.262 --> 20:49.754
I guess I showed them, huh?

20:51.852 --> 20:53.228
That should hold.

20:53.396 --> 20:55.604
- Thank you.
- Sure.

20:59.406 --> 21:01.282
Hey, where's my car?

21:01.661 --> 21:02.942
Impound lot out back. Okay.

21:03.121 --> 21:04.616
Wait.

21:05.124 --> 21:07.035
You're not going out there?

21:07.795 --> 21:10.122
Yeah, I gotta get something
out of my trunk.

22:27.801 --> 22:29.462
They're coming!

22:33.894 --> 22:35.223
Hurry!

23:26.480 --> 23:28.557
- Everybody okay?
- Define "okay."

23:29.651 --> 23:31.230
Right, everybody needs to put these on.

23:31.822 --> 23:34.149
It'll keep you from being possessed.

23:34.911 --> 23:36.536
Here you go.

23:38.625 --> 23:40.500
What about you and Sam?

23:43.716 --> 23:44.880
Smart.

23:45.052 --> 23:46.333
How long have you had those?

23:46.512 --> 23:47.592
Not long enough.

24:05.961 --> 24:07.337
Hey, that's Jenna Rubner.

24:11.220 --> 24:12.680
That's not Jenna anymore.

24:13.140 --> 24:15.217
That's where all that
black demon smoke went?

24:15.394 --> 24:16.723
Looks like.

24:40.518 --> 24:42.558
Shotgun shells full of salt.

24:44.357 --> 24:47.775
- Whatever works.
- Fighting off monsters with condiments.

24:49.825 --> 24:52.400
So turns out demons are real.

24:54.708 --> 24:56.867
FYI, ghosts are real too.

24:57.504 --> 25:00.079
So are werewolves, vampires...

25:00.258 --> 25:03.130
changelings,
evil clowns that eat people.

25:04.974 --> 25:06.303
Okay, then.

25:06.476 --> 25:08.970
If it makes you feel better,
Bigfoot's a hoax.

25:09.816 --> 25:11.394
It doesn't.

25:13.321 --> 25:14.982
How many demons?

25:15.158 --> 25:16.653
Total?

25:16.827 --> 25:19.117
No clue. A lot.

25:21.543 --> 25:22.742
You know what my job is?

25:25.173 --> 25:27.928
You mean,
besides locking up the good guys?

25:28.096 --> 25:30.006
No, I have no idea.

25:30.182 --> 25:31.808
My job is boring.

25:31.977 --> 25:33.472
It's frustrating.

25:33.646 --> 25:36.020
You work three years for one break...

25:36.192 --> 25:39.479
and then maybe you can save
a few people. Maybe.

25:40.657 --> 25:41.903
That's the payoff.

25:42.076 --> 25:45.282
Been busting my ass for 15 years
to nail a handful of guys...

25:45.458 --> 25:48.663
and all this while, there was something
off in the corner so big.

25:49.297 --> 25:53.546
So, yeah, sign me up for that big
frosty mug of wasting my damn life.

25:54.263 --> 25:55.675
You didn't know.

25:55.849 --> 25:57.510
Well, now I do.

26:02.109 --> 26:04.020
What's out there?

26:04.197 --> 26:05.858
Can you guys beat it?

26:06.033 --> 26:07.908
Can you win?

26:09.914 --> 26:12.917
Honestly, I think the world's
gonna end bloody.

26:14.338 --> 26:16.581
But that doesn't mean
we shouldn't fight.

26:16.800 --> 26:18.046
We do have choices.

26:18.386 --> 26:20.925
I choose to go down swinging.

26:24.271 --> 26:27.357
Plus, you got nothing to go home to
but your brother.

26:28.110 --> 26:29.570
Yeah.

26:30.865 --> 26:32.942
What about you,
you rocking the white-picket fence?

26:33.118 --> 26:37.534
Uh-uh. No. Empty apartment,
string of angry ex-wives.

26:37.709 --> 26:39.703
I'm right where you are.

26:41.883 --> 26:43.758
Imagine that.

26:48.853 --> 26:50.597
- How do we kill her?
- We don't.

26:50.772 --> 26:52.433
- She's a demon.
- She's here to help us.

26:52.608 --> 26:54.187
Are you kidding?

26:59.494 --> 27:01.406
Are you gonna let me out?

27:09.010 --> 27:10.755
And they say chivalry's dead.

27:12.349 --> 27:15.020
Anyone have a breath mint?
Some guts splattered in my mouth...

27:15.187 --> 27:17.513
while I was killing my way in here.

27:29.460 --> 27:30.576
How many are out there?

27:30.754 --> 27:33.626
Thirty at least. That's so far.

27:33.801 --> 27:36.720
Oh, good. Thirty.
Thirty hit men all gunning for us.

27:37.348 --> 27:38.974
Who sent them?

27:40.479 --> 27:41.725
You didn't tell Dean?

27:42.482 --> 27:45.057
- Wow. I'm surprised.
- Tell me what?

27:45.236 --> 27:49.071
There's a big new up-and-comer.
A real pied piper.

27:49.243 --> 27:51.236
- Who is he?
- Not he.

27:51.413 --> 27:52.991
Her.

27:53.166 --> 27:55.076
- Her name is Lilith.
- Lilith?

27:55.252 --> 27:58.755
And she really, really wants
Sam's intestines on a stick.

27:59.134 --> 28:01.508
Guess she sees him as competition.

28:01.930 --> 28:03.758
You knew about this?

28:05.728 --> 28:07.936
Well, jeez, Sam.
Is there anything else I should know?

28:09.401 --> 28:11.727
How about the two of you
talk about this later?

28:11.904 --> 28:13.186
We'll need the Colt.

28:19.250 --> 28:20.449
Where's the Colt?

28:22.714 --> 28:25.468
- It got stolen.
- I'm sorry, I must have blood in my ear.

28:25.969 --> 28:27.963
I heard you say you were stupid enough...

28:28.139 --> 28:32.389
to let the Colt get grabbed out
of your thick, clumsy, idiotic hands.

28:33.940 --> 28:35.484
Fantastic.

28:36.821 --> 28:38.316
This is just peachy.

28:38.490 --> 28:40.283
Ruby... Shut up.

28:44.166 --> 28:45.709
Fine.

28:47.755 --> 28:49.998
Since I don't see
that there's any other option...

28:50.175 --> 28:53.511
there's one other way I know
how to get you out of here alive.

28:53.681 --> 28:55.842
- What's that?
- I know a spell.

28:56.436 --> 28:58.015
It'll vaporize every demon...

28:58.189 --> 28:59.933
in a one-mile radius.

29:00.109 --> 29:01.520
Myself included.

29:03.364 --> 29:06.367
So you let the Colt out of your sight
and now I have to die.

29:07.871 --> 29:09.865
So next time, be more careful.

29:10.709 --> 29:12.334
How's that for a dying wish?

29:16.886 --> 29:18.512
Okay. What do we need to do?

29:18.681 --> 29:21.304
Aw. You can't do anything.

29:21.477 --> 29:23.305
This spell is very specific.

29:23.480 --> 29:25.059
It calls for a person of virtue.

29:26.902 --> 29:28.896
- I got virtue.
- Ha, ha.

29:29.072 --> 29:30.982
Nice try. You're not a virgin.

29:33.914 --> 29:35.077
Nobody's a virgin.

29:46.726 --> 29:49.053
No. No way.

29:49.230 --> 29:52.732
- You're kidding me. You're...
- What? It's a choice, okay?

29:53.446 --> 29:54.775
What, so you...? You never...?

29:56.200 --> 29:58.907
Not even once? I mean, not even...?

29:59.915 --> 30:00.946
Wow.

30:02.627 --> 30:04.870
So the spell.

30:05.590 --> 30:06.622
What can I do?

30:06.800 --> 30:08.878
You can hold still...

30:09.972 --> 30:12.133
while I cut your heart from your chest.
What?

30:12.310 --> 30:14.269
- What, are you crazy?
- I'm offering a solution.

30:14.439 --> 30:15.815
You're offering to kill somebody.

30:15.983 --> 30:18.190
What do you think's gonna happen
when the demons get in?

30:18.361 --> 30:20.402
- We're gonna protect her.
- Very noble.

30:20.573 --> 30:22.282
Excuse me? You're all gonna die.

30:22.451 --> 30:24.741
- This is the only way.
- Yeah, there's no way...

30:24.913 --> 30:27.488
that you're gonna prove...
Everybody please shut up.

30:28.377 --> 30:30.456
All the people out there...

30:30.632 --> 30:31.664
will it save them?

30:32.134 --> 30:34.591
It'll blow the demons out of their bodies.

30:34.763 --> 30:37.968
So if their bodies are okay, yeah.

30:45.030 --> 30:47.356
- I'll do it.
- No. No. You don't need to do this.

30:47.534 --> 30:48.698
All my friends are out there.

30:48.870 --> 30:52.122
We don't sacrifice people.
We do that, we're no better than them.

30:54.963 --> 30:56.506
We don't have a choice.

30:56.674 --> 30:58.798
- Well, your choice is not a choice.
- Sam.

30:58.969 --> 31:00.844
You know I'm right.

31:05.104 --> 31:06.136
Sam?

31:07.818 --> 31:10.393
What the hell is going on? Sam, tell her.

31:11.407 --> 31:12.487
It's my decision.

31:13.577 --> 31:15.487
- Damn straight, cherry pie.
- Stop.

31:16.748 --> 31:18.030
Stop.

31:18.418 --> 31:20.328
Nobody kill any virgins.

31:23.092 --> 31:24.884
Sam, I need to talk to you.

31:30.104 --> 31:32.098
Please tell me you're not considering this.

31:32.274 --> 31:33.935
Talking about cutting out her heart.

31:34.110 --> 31:36.484
We're also talking
about 30 people out there, Dean.

31:36.656 --> 31:37.688
Innocent people...

31:37.866 --> 31:40.406
who are all gonna die,
along with everyone in here.

31:40.579 --> 31:44.116
It doesn't mean that we throw away
the rule book and stop acting like humans.

31:44.627 --> 31:47.749
I'm not gonna let that demon
kill some nice, sweet, innocent girl...

31:47.925 --> 31:49.965
who hasn't even been laid.

31:50.304 --> 31:52.214
If that's how you win wars,
I don't wanna win.

31:52.390 --> 31:54.799
Then what? What do we do, Dean?

32:00.904 --> 32:01.983
I got a plan.

32:02.156 --> 32:04.827
I'm not saying it's a good one,
not saying that it'll work...

32:04.994 --> 32:06.620
but it sure beats killing a virgin.

32:06.789 --> 32:08.450
Okay, so, what's the plan?

32:08.625 --> 32:11.462
Open the doors. Let them all in.

32:12.089 --> 32:13.798
And we fight.

32:21.771 --> 32:23.433
Get the equipment to work? Yeah.

32:23.608 --> 32:25.732
- So?
- So this is insane.

32:25.903 --> 32:27.482
You win understatement of the year.

32:27.656 --> 32:30.908
- I get it. You think...
- I don't think. I know.

32:31.078 --> 32:32.360
It's not gonna work.

32:34.417 --> 32:36.126
So long, boys.

32:36.295 --> 32:38.834
- So you're just gonna leave?
- Hey.

32:39.508 --> 32:42.382
I was gonna kill myself to help you win.

32:42.556 --> 32:44.846
I'm not gonna stand here
and watch you lose.

32:48.899 --> 32:50.311
And I'm disappointed.

32:50.485 --> 32:51.897
Because I tried.

32:52.071 --> 32:54.112
I really did.

32:54.617 --> 32:57.109
But clearly, I bet on the wrong horse.

33:02.255 --> 33:04.083
Do you mind letting me out?

33:20.660 --> 33:22.488
I'm leaving.

33:23.456 --> 33:25.533
Who wants to stop me?

33:43.697 --> 33:44.812
All set?

33:44.991 --> 33:47.115
Yeah. Ready.

33:47.286 --> 33:49.280
Let's do this.

34:46.049 --> 34:47.627
I hope this works.

35:02.659 --> 35:04.452
Go, go, go!

35:24.737 --> 35:28.607
When this is over,
I'm gonna have so much sex.

35:30.287 --> 35:31.913
But not with you.

35:32.083 --> 35:33.993
We better move.

36:40.444 --> 36:42.687
Henriksen, now!

38:38.553 --> 38:39.717
I better call in.

38:39.889 --> 38:41.634
Hell of a story I won't be telling.

38:41.810 --> 38:43.139
So, what are you gonna tell them?

38:43.646 --> 38:46.648
The least ridiculous lie I can come up with
in the next five minutes.

38:46.817 --> 38:49.524
Good luck with that.
Not to pressure you or anything...

38:49.697 --> 38:52.272
what're you planning to do about us?
I'm gonna kill you.

38:53.995 --> 38:57.366
Sam and Dean Winchester were in
the chopper when it caught on fire.

38:57.543 --> 39:00.879
Nothing's left. Can't even identify them
with dental records.

39:02.844 --> 39:04.553
Rest in peace, guys.

39:15.864 --> 39:17.276
Now get out of here.

39:17.909 --> 39:19.073
Yeah.

39:36.314 --> 39:37.394
Oh, hey, there.

39:38.486 --> 39:41.773
Excuse me, I'm looking for two boys.
They're brothers.

39:42.325 --> 39:44.533
One's really tall and one's really cute?

39:45.914 --> 39:47.374
What's your name, sweetie?

39:48.919 --> 39:50.580
Lilith.

40:14.585 --> 40:16.045
Turn on the news.

40:20.137 --> 40:24.219
<i>The community is reeling from the tragedy
that happened just a few hours ago.</i>

40:24.393 --> 40:28.394
<i>Authorities believe a gas main ruptured,
causing the massive explosion...</i>

40:28.567 --> 40:33.315
<i>that ripped apart the police station
and claimed the lives of everyone inside.</i>

40:33.491 --> 40:36.281
<i>Among the deceased,
at least six police officers and staff...</i>

40:36.455 --> 40:39.577
<i>including Sheriff Melvin Dodd,
Deputy Phil Amici...</i>

40:39.752 --> 40:41.247
<i>secretary Nancy Fitzgerald...</i>

40:41.421 --> 40:44.839
<i>as well as three FBI agents
identified as Steven Groves...</i>

40:45.010 --> 40:47.051
<i>Calvin Reidy and Victor Henriksen.</i>

40:47.222 --> 40:49.929
<i>Two fugitives in custody
were also killed.</i>

40:50.102 --> 40:54.269
<i>We'll continue to follow the story here at
the scene, but for now, back to you, Jim.</i>

41:02.163 --> 41:05.700
- Must've happened right after we left.
- Considering the size of the blast...

41:08.006 --> 41:10.296
smart money's on Lilith.

41:10.593 --> 41:12.837
- What's in these?
- Something that'll protect you.

41:13.015 --> 41:16.184
Throw Lilith off your trail.
For the time being, at least.

41:16.354 --> 41:18.063
Thanks. Don't thank me.

41:18.732 --> 41:20.810
Lilith killed everyone.

41:21.570 --> 41:25.950
She slaughtered your precious little virgin
plus a half a dozen other people.

41:26.828 --> 41:29.072
So after your big speech
about humanity and war...

41:29.249 --> 41:32.039
turns out your plan
was the one with the body count.

41:34.133 --> 41:36.173
Do you know how to fight a battle?

41:36.345 --> 41:38.588
You strike fast
and you don't leave any survivors...

41:38.765 --> 41:41.092
so no one can go running
to tell the boss.

41:41.269 --> 41:44.556
So next time, we go with my plan.
