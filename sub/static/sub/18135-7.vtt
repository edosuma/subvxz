(GROWLING)

00:30.831 --> 00:31.830
(GROANS)

00:34.267 --> 00:36.201
Thanks for the assist,
partner.

00:36.236 --> 00:39.805
I didn't see Parademons
in today's weather forecast.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.541
I traced the battalion's
energy signature
when they deployed.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.044
That's 12 for me.

00:46.079 --> 00:49.181
On Apokolips we vie to see
who can down the most enemies.

00:49.216 --> 00:50.849
Do you not do the same?

00:50.884 --> 00:51.884
No.

00:54.287 --> 00:55.587
(GROWLING)

01:00.227 --> 01:02.160
(GROANING)

01:02.195 --> 01:04.396
58, but who's counting?

01:04.431 --> 01:05.631
(GROWLING)

01:07.467 --> 01:09.501
-59.
-Show-off.

01:09.536 --> 01:13.405
Be warned, these Parademons
were followed
by a singular entity.

01:14.274 --> 01:16.074
-Darkseid?
-Possible.

01:16.109 --> 01:18.811
But one squadron
doesn't sound like Darkseid.

01:20.580 --> 01:23.281
Darkseid's inner circle
is legion and mighty.

01:23.316 --> 01:24.716
It could be anyone...

01:27.020 --> 01:28.020
Steppenwolf!

01:31.992 --> 01:33.592
(GRUNTING)

01:33.627 --> 01:35.894
Excellent, Superman.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.029
As powerful as ever.

01:37.964 --> 01:38.897
That's good.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.499
What's this about,
Steppenwolf?

01:40.534 --> 01:42.534
It's about you, Kryptonian.

01:42.569 --> 01:45.003
And your utter defeat
at my hand!

01:45.038 --> 01:46.538
(CHARGING)

01:47.474 --> 01:48.674
Behind you!

01:50.644 --> 01:51.944
BIG BARDA: He took Superman!

01:52.579 --> 01:53.779
BATMAN: But where?

02:09.129 --> 02:11.563
You can waste all day shooting
at me, Steppenwolf.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.967
Not this day, Kryptonian.

02:16.002 --> 02:17.702
We'll see about that.

02:17.737 --> 02:19.571
That's it, Superman,

02:19.606 --> 02:22.507
burn through your body's
precious energy.

02:22.542 --> 02:25.477
Hardly the ferocious
heat vision I expected.

02:25.512 --> 02:27.512
What...
What have you done to me?

02:27.547 --> 02:32.484
Your body is a solar battery
for the yellow Sun of Earth,
Kryptonian.

02:32.519 --> 02:35.587
But we are no longer on Earth.

02:36.056 --> 02:37.422
Behold!

02:39.392 --> 02:42.360
You are betrayed
by your own biology.

02:42.395 --> 02:43.996
And by my own genius.

02:49.302 --> 02:51.503
Yes!
Thrash and flail!

02:51.538 --> 02:53.405
The more energy you expend...

02:54.274 --> 02:56.675
(GROANS)

02:56.710 --> 02:59.645
The faster you descend
into powerlessness.

03:02.282 --> 03:04.316
Once I beat you,

03:04.351 --> 03:08.386
I will forever be the warrior
that bested Superman!

03:08.421 --> 03:11.256
Even Lord Darkseid
will be impressed.

03:11.291 --> 03:13.024
Don't count on it!

03:13.059 --> 03:14.059
(GRUNTS)

03:18.865 --> 03:19.865
Argh!

03:33.980 --> 03:37.282
If you were any kind
of "super man,"

03:37.317 --> 03:38.750
you would face me!

03:42.756 --> 03:44.289
How's this for "super?"

03:44.324 --> 03:45.490
(ROCK CREAKING)

03:45.525 --> 03:46.925
Argh!

(FLUTTERING)

04:01.875 --> 04:04.276
Fetch me my Astro-Harness!

04:04.311 --> 04:06.711
I will hunt him,
I will find him,

04:06.746 --> 04:08.713
and I will break Superman,

04:08.748 --> 04:11.917
before this red sun sets.

04:23.363 --> 04:24.996
Welcome to Apokolips.

04:25.031 --> 04:29.868
Steppenwolf's starscape maps
are compiled in his war room.

04:29.903 --> 04:33.038
There, in Darkseid's citadel.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.240
(THUNDERING)

04:35.275 --> 04:37.208
Just like home.

04:37.243 --> 04:38.677

04:40.647 --> 04:41.847
Demon dog! Get behind me!

04:51.958 --> 04:52.957
Boo.

04:52.992 --> 04:55.160
-(WHIMPERING)
-That's one for me.

04:57.664 --> 04:59.264
BIG BARDA: You said
you didn't keep count!

05:05.071 --> 05:08.006
Pa was right,
"Once a scout,
always a scout."

05:08.041 --> 05:09.774
(GROWLING)

05:09.809 --> 05:12.677
Sensors indicate the canyon
dead-ends to a lake.

05:12.712 --> 05:14.212
He won't be far.

05:14.247 --> 05:16.748
I thought this was
between you and me, Wolfie.

05:16.783 --> 05:18.883
I didn't think
legends needed help.

05:18.918 --> 05:21.253
Spread out!
Find the Kryptonian!

Two down.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.017
(GROANING)

05:53.720 --> 05:56.554
A tactical blunder, Superman.

05:56.589 --> 05:58.790
You've squandered
your head start.

06:05.832 --> 06:08.867
I've had my fill of your
feeble traps.

06:11.137 --> 06:12.337
(ROCKS FALLING)

06:14.107 --> 06:17.309
Now I'll bring this entire
mountain down upon you.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.385
Up, up and away.

06:33.426 --> 06:35.860
There. Steppenwolf's war room.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.162
Give me five minutes.

06:37.197 --> 06:38.363
Wait.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.864
(GROWLING)

06:39.899 --> 06:42.667
If they spot us, they'll alert
the entire citadel.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.504
(GROWLING)

06:46.539 --> 06:48.106
I'll count to three.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.974
One. Two.

06:50.009 --> 06:51.009
(GRUNTS)

06:52.011 --> 06:54.846
That's one. To my two.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.752
Hundreds of planets earmarked.

07:00.787 --> 07:03.021
-All under a red sun.
-That's bad.

07:03.056 --> 07:05.023
MAN: Well hello, intruders.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.958
You mistakenly thought
you could hack

07:06.993 --> 07:09.594
-the impenetrable system of...
-Batman, no! He's...

07:09.629 --> 07:11.429
Virman Vunderbar!

07:11.464 --> 07:12.897
Short.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.300
It seems that while my partner
crushes Superman,

07:15.335 --> 07:18.770
I have to deal with my own
infestation of heroes.

07:18.805 --> 07:20.672
Where is Steppenwolf?

07:28.314 --> 07:31.449
My newest invention,
the kinetic force shield.

07:31.484 --> 07:34.986
Your back will break before
my device does, my dear.

07:35.021 --> 07:40.124
-Argh!
-Barda, the field is kinetic.
It matches oncoming force.

07:40.159 --> 07:44.262
You push, it redirects
your own energy to push back.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.630
But what about...

07:45.665 --> 07:49.868
Erm, what are you saying?
Whispering? That is so rude!

07:57.377 --> 07:58.910
(SCREAMING)

08:02.315 --> 08:03.648
Hey, what is this?

08:03.683 --> 08:06.951
Just testing how long your
shield can last, Vunderbar.

08:06.986 --> 08:10.121
Fools!
My device can last forever!

08:10.156 --> 08:11.556
(CACKLING)

08:11.591 --> 08:14.292
Maybe under kinetic impact,
like punches. But I'm guessing

08:14.327 --> 08:16.694
it won't work as well against
steady pressure.

08:16.729 --> 08:19.964
-Like say, solid rock.
-(GRUNTING)

08:19.999 --> 08:24.869
I'll repeat the question.
Where did Steppenwolf
take Superman?

08:24.904 --> 08:26.704
(EXCLAIMS)
All right, all right,

08:26.739 --> 08:30.174
you're correct!
I'll tell you everything!
Don't let me squish!

08:30.209 --> 08:34.346
No way! I get this one.
I did the heavy lifting.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.851

(GRUNTING)

09:48.755 --> 09:50.288
I win, Kryptonian.

09:52.759 --> 09:57.362
The entire universe will know
the name of the man
who destroyed Superman.

10:30.730 --> 10:33.765
Ah, good. I was wondering
how I was gonna get home.

10:33.800 --> 10:37.402
Wait, you defeated
Steppenwolf, without powers?

10:37.437 --> 10:40.438
And I... (GRUNTS)
Broke my leg.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.006
Hurts, doesn't it?

10:42.041 --> 10:43.642
It really does.

10:45.111 --> 10:47.312
-What was the final tally?
-We tied.

10:48.881 --> 10:50.215
Two to two.

10:51.084 --> 10:52.283
I got three.

10:54.620 --> 10:57.989
Half a day under a red sun
and he still beat us both.

10:58.024 --> 11:00.492
That's why they
call me Superman.
