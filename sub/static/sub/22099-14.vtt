We all made sacrifices.

00:27.277 --> 00:30.029
Is that so?
Yes, that's right.

00:30.114 --> 00:34.575
Then how come some Cylon
lover is holding down my post?

00:34.660 --> 00:36.869
ATHENA: Hera's alive. I'm her
mother and I'm going to get her.

I'm not a traitor. I did
what I thought was right.

00:47.923 --> 00:49.215
She'll get Hera.

00:49.299 --> 00:50.633
Let's go.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.096
No! Hold your fire!

in the brig.

01:03.981 --> 01:05.022
Do you?

01:05.107 --> 01:08.693
So what happens next?
We give him his trial.

01:09.111 --> 01:12.572
Do they really think they can squeeze most
of these onto the starboard hangar deck?

01:12.656 --> 01:14.031
That's why Helo
was transferred down here,

01:14.116 --> 01:15.950
to manage
the civilian refugees.

01:16.076 --> 01:19.620
Sir, we got the breakdown on the
Thera Sita's inhabitants coming aboard.

01:19.705 --> 01:22.248
Fifty-one Sagittarons.
Oh, boy.

01:22.332 --> 01:24.917
Helo might be
overmatched down there.

02:35.322 --> 02:38.115
So, pretty rough night
last night, huh?

02:39.827 --> 02:41.911
Hey, I said you
didn't sleep so well.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.288
Just a stupid dream.
Whatever.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.750
So, you're okay?
Yeah.

02:49.044 --> 02:52.296
They're about to increase the population
down there by 300 and you're okay.

02:52.381 --> 02:55.216
Yeah. I don't know
where I'm gonna put them,

02:55.300 --> 02:58.052
but it's not like I'm walking
around taking my own pulse. I'm fine.

see you around, Helo.

Yeah. You guys know
where to find me.

03:21.910 --> 03:25.705
You're gonna check up on Hera, right?
Yes. Babe, I'm gonna check up on Hera.

Excuse me, ma'am? Could I
have a brief look at your son?

No, no, no. We're fine. We're
fine. We don't need a doctor.

need a doctor.

don't believe in medicine.

Robert. He's our civilian doctor.

with the military.

07:09.221 --> 07:11.597
So what have
we got here, Mike?

07:11.681 --> 07:13.140
Mellorak Sickness.

07:13.225 --> 07:15.518
It originates in the kidneys

07:15.602 --> 07:19.897
and then rapidly attacks the
respiratory and the immune system.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.774
It's a nasty bit
of business.

07:21.858 --> 07:24.985
If you don't treat the first
symptoms within 48 hours,

07:25.070 --> 07:27.279
it'll kill you within
three to five days.

07:27.364 --> 07:28.823
How contagious is it?

07:28.907 --> 07:31.700
Well, it's not airborne,
so we lucked out there.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.411
It's spread through
human contact,

07:34.496 --> 07:38.624
saliva, sexual intercourse,
through the skin...

07:38.708 --> 07:41.710
Right now, it seems
confined to the Sagittarons.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.463
That's good.
They're welcome to it.

07:44.548 --> 07:47.967
It's obviously spreading down
there where we were working.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.344
It's curable?
Absolutely, yes.

07:50.428 --> 07:53.514
A shot of bittamusin and you're
right as rain in a day or two.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.891
And sedatives alleviate
the symptoms.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.477
But I don't know how long our
stock of bittamusin will hold out,

07:58.562 --> 07:59.812
so we should probably
conserve it

07:59.896 --> 08:02.898
and only inoculate after
the first symptoms show.

08:02.983 --> 08:06.235
ADAMA: This is a civilian infection,
Dr. Robert, so it's in your hands.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.488
But I want Tyrol and the crew
immunized before they get sick.

08:09.573 --> 08:11.448
I don't need any downtime.

08:11.533 --> 08:15.703
If we disinfect everything and stress
hygiene, some people won't get sick.

08:15.787 --> 08:18.289
And they won't need
the medicine.

08:18.373 --> 08:20.291
Then shouldn't we get
everyone to the showers?

08:20.375 --> 08:23.169
Especially the Sagittarons.
We should make an announcement.

08:23.253 --> 08:28.424
No. No, we don't want to single them
out any more than we already have to.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.509
We'll have a riot
on our hands.

08:30.594 --> 08:34.096
Now, if it were up to me, I would
say just get the Sagittarons settled

08:34.181 --> 08:38.142
and then deal with the civvies
that have already arrived.

08:38.643 --> 08:42.438
Well, at least, you won't have to worry about
having enough medicine for the Sagittarons.

08:42.522 --> 08:46.150
Yeah. Most of them
are gonna refuse it.

medicine's been the great curse.

it's a really potent smell, yeah.

Sagittarons use it as a calmative.

Relax. The doc dosed me.

I hear it's pretty rough down there,
huh? Only if you're a Sagittaron.

It just seems so senseless.

I have a feeling, one of these days,
we're gonna wake up in the morning,

15:39.230 --> 15:41.273
I'm gonna be really pissed
'cause we're out of meds

15:41.357 --> 15:43.609
'cause those frakwads saw the
light and now we gotta share.

finger down on New Caprica against the Cylons.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.493
Hey. Chief,
knock it off.

15:53.578 --> 15:57.122
Well, a lot of good Resistance
people lost their lives.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.541
I said knock it off.
All right?

16:00.209 --> 16:01.376
Oh.

16:03.588 --> 16:05.839
Sorry, Dee.
It's all right.

I have more of a reason to be mad
at them than you do. I am Sagittaron.

Most of them are paranoid,
pigheaded and argumentative.

Yeah, well, they're sure making
it miserable for Dr. Robert.

16:17.060 --> 16:20.395
Medicine's an abomination.
It's a sin against the Gods.

I'm still not sure
why you did it, though.

Yeah.

17:24.711 --> 17:28.422

is to work with them.

they changed their mind?

of the night.

Now I'm gonna go treat them,
if it's all right with you.

21:06.682 --> 21:08.683
The doctor's version of
when he administered the drug

21:08.768 --> 21:11.102
greatly differed
from that of Mrs. King.

The woman. King.

King. Her son showed symptoms.

She immediately took him to Robert
for treatment. The boy still died.

In the other case, Robert treated a
Sagittaron without the man's consent.

done to all of them in the first place.

have been gone by now.

21:28.496 --> 21:29.537

21:29.622 --> 21:32.666
is we're trying to respect
the customs of the Sagittarons.

21:32.750 --> 21:35.293
But that's the point.
He didn't respect them, sir.

the right guy for the job,

for the guy who crosses the line

29:23.887 --> 29:25.930
So, you're saying...

29:28.684 --> 29:30.268
Just leave it.

29:31.395 --> 29:32.645
What does that mean,
"Just leave it"?

29:32.729 --> 29:34.605
It means it's your job
to manage these people, Helo,

29:34.690 --> 29:37.024
and you just gotta do it.

29:42.322 --> 29:44.073
Yeah. You know what?

29:45.701 --> 29:47.869
You're right. It's me.

29:49.288 --> 29:50.997
It's all in my frakking head.

29:51.081 --> 29:52.832
I didn't say that.

29:53.917 --> 29:56.502
Where are you going?
I don't know.

30:01.550 --> 30:02.717
(DOOR CLOSING)

30:17.900 --> 30:19.066
Doc?

31:21.338 --> 31:25.049
You ought to try a bed, Helo.
You'll get more sleep that way.

31:25.133 --> 31:27.552
He's killing them.
It's right here.

31:27.636 --> 31:29.554
You get your righteous ass
out of here right now,

31:29.638 --> 31:32.515
before I have the old man lock
you up and throw away the key.

31:32.599 --> 31:35.726
No, listen to me. He
killed them, on New Caprica.

31:35.811 --> 31:40.648
Look. Guy goes in for a cough,
he dies of heart failure.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.233
Here. See for yourself!

31:42.317 --> 31:44.235
This one. Woman
had simple appendicitis.

31:44.319 --> 31:45.778
She died on
the operating table.

31:45.862 --> 31:48.114
Of the Picons he treated?
Twelve percent of them died.

31:48.198 --> 31:52.201
Capricans. He likes Capricans.
The mortality rate was six percent.

31:52.286 --> 31:56.038
Sagittarons? Ninety percent. Ninety
percent of the Sagittarons died...

31:56.123 --> 31:59.083
I'm not going to listen
to this! You hear me?

31:59.167 --> 32:01.085
That man has
his hands full down there.

32:01.169 --> 32:04.797
He's singling out Sagittarons!
That doesn't bother you?

32:04.923 --> 32:06.465
What exactly... Doctor,
that doesn't bother you?

32:06.592 --> 32:09.010
What exactly is he doing? I
don't know. I'm not a doctor.

32:09.094 --> 32:11.429
Well, now that's the first
sensible thing you've said yet.

32:11.513 --> 32:13.389
Listen to me. I don't think
he's giving them the medicine.

32:13.473 --> 32:15.933
Something.
He's doing something!

32:16.018 --> 32:18.853
My Gods! You're not
gonna let it go, are you?

32:18.937 --> 32:23.190
Please. Can you do an autopsy on
Mrs. King's son to see how he died?

32:25.736 --> 32:30.448
I'll let it go. I will. I promise.
I will let it go. Just check.

32:30.532 --> 32:33.951
I did. I checked King's son.

32:34.036 --> 32:37.622
Mellorak sickness. He had
bittamusin in his system.

32:40.042 --> 32:42.126
All right? Now that's it.

32:42.210 --> 32:45.671
Now you just leave it.
And get out of here!

33:15.702 --> 33:19.413
Hey, Doc? I don't really feel so good.

33:21.083 --> 33:23.918
Think I can get
some of that bittamusin?

33:39.267 --> 33:42.478
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

33:50.195 --> 33:51.570
ATHENA: Who is it?

33:56.451 --> 33:57.451
(KNOCKING)

33:58.453 --> 34:00.621
Hey, Hera. It's okay.

34:02.958 --> 34:06.210
Mrs. King? Your friend,
the soldier, Dualla.

34:06.294 --> 34:08.838
She's sick. She went to
the doctor. She went...

34:08.964 --> 34:11.882
Slow down, slow down.
What? No, you listen to me.

34:11.967 --> 34:13.551
We lost two more tonight,

34:13.635 --> 34:16.387
Sagittarons who let
that murderer treat them.

34:16.471 --> 34:18.431
You have to do something.

34:18.515 --> 34:20.349
Excuse me.
What is she doing here?

34:20.434 --> 34:21.726
GUARD 1: There she is!
Ma'am?

34:21.810 --> 34:24.603
You're not supposed to
be here. Let's go. Now.

34:27.315 --> 34:32.069
Sorry, Captain. Frakking refugees.
I don't know how she snuck through.

34:32.154 --> 34:33.654
Morning, Sir.

34:48.253 --> 34:52.715
Don't. Don't even think it.
Sharon, it's Dualla.

34:52.799 --> 34:55.092
Dualla went down there.
She has a husband.

34:55.177 --> 34:56.927
Yeah, and he's out
flying CAP.

34:57.012 --> 35:00.806
She'll be fine. She'll take
her meds. She'll be fine.

35:03.351 --> 35:06.562
You know what's all over the
ship? You and the Sagittarons.

35:06.646 --> 35:09.523
How you might actually
be listening to them.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.193
That's my job.

35:12.277 --> 35:15.279
They're dying because they're
refusing medication, Karl.

35:15.363 --> 35:17.907
You want me to look the other
way. Is that it? Is that it?

35:18.033 --> 35:20.242
Our daughter's fine.
That's all that matters? No!

35:20.327 --> 35:22.411
Or is it because as long as
everyone hates the Sagittarons,

35:22.496 --> 35:25.289
they'll forget you're
a Cylon for five minutes.

35:25.373 --> 35:27.583
You shut the frak up.

35:29.377 --> 35:31.462
Yeah. I want you
to look the other way.

35:31.546 --> 35:33.881
I have to fight every single
day on this ship to be accepted.

35:33.965 --> 35:38.260
This has nothing
to do with you! Okay?

35:38.345 --> 35:40.137
You think that's who I am?
That's what I've become?

35:40.222 --> 35:44.058
That's my defining characteristic?
The guy married to a Cylon?

35:49.564 --> 35:50.815
This guy's dirty.

35:50.899 --> 35:52.691
I think he's a liar and I
think he's killing people

35:52.776 --> 35:54.401
because he's a racist
son of a bitch.

36:01.618 --> 36:03.577
Make a hole!
Get out of the way!

36:03.662 --> 36:06.080
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

36:19.553 --> 36:21.428
Dee? Dee?

36:22.556 --> 36:24.098
Dualla?

36:29.145 --> 36:30.479
Dualla?

36:31.273 --> 36:33.190
(PANTING)

36:36.528 --> 36:39.822
No. No, no, no, no!

36:43.243 --> 36:44.827
Dualla. Hey!

36:44.911 --> 36:46.954
(EXCLAIMING)

36:47.914 --> 36:50.666
Hey. What are you
doing down here?

36:50.750 --> 36:57.131
Dr. Robert, he gave me something
that kicked the frak out of me.

36:59.301 --> 37:01.719
Where's Lee? We're gonna
go see him. Come on.

37:01.803 --> 37:03.554
Come on.
Gotta take you to Cottle.

37:03.638 --> 37:05.264
No.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on.

37:05.348 --> 37:07.641
He's got hands of stone.
I know. I know. Come on.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.393
Hey. What the hell
are you doing here?

37:09.477 --> 37:10.811
She's coming with me.

37:10.896 --> 37:13.230
No, she's not. She's in no
condition to go anywhere.

37:13.315 --> 37:14.899
I'm taking her to Cottle,
just to be sure.

37:14.983 --> 37:17.443
What do you mean, be... Hey,
hey! Get the hell out of here!

37:17.527 --> 37:20.446
Get the frak out of my way, Doctor! Now!

37:21.990 --> 37:23.991
Come on, honey. Come on. No.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.451
Security!

37:30.165 --> 37:33.542
Agathon, he's lost it. I don't know.
He's hurting one of my patients.

37:33.627 --> 37:35.085
He poisoned her.
I'm taking her to Cottle.

37:35.170 --> 37:36.170
ROBERT: Get the XO.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.254
DUALLA: Leave me alone.

37:37.339 --> 37:38.422
Sir.
No. Not Cottle.

37:38.506 --> 37:39.965
Please just leave me alone! No.

37:44.930 --> 37:47.640
Captain, what's going
on, sir? Leave me alone.

37:47.724 --> 37:49.600
Captain!
I wanna sleep.

37:49.684 --> 37:51.018
No, no, no, Dee.
Come on, we gotta go.

37:51.144 --> 37:52.519
Captain, she doesn't
want to go. We gotta go.

37:52.646 --> 37:56.440
Sir! She says she doesn't want to
go! Get your hand off me, Sergeant!

37:56.524 --> 37:57.942
You stand down, sir!

37:58.026 --> 38:00.444
Get your frakking
hands off me!

38:01.863 --> 38:04.448
Get your gun
out of my face!

38:04.532 --> 38:05.824
Cool it!

38:05.909 --> 38:09.119
I don't know what kind of a crusade
you're on or who you're trying to impress,

38:09.204 --> 38:11.121
but it seriously
is not working.

38:11.206 --> 38:13.040
You're killing them, Robert.
I know you're doing it.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.959
Stand down!

38:15.043 --> 38:16.210
Saul.

38:17.754 --> 38:20.130
You told me he was a flake. You
didn't tell me he was dangerous!

38:20.215 --> 38:22.007
Shut the frak up!

38:29.015 --> 38:30.557
How is she?

38:32.394 --> 38:34.395
She's been sedated.
But she's okay.

38:34.479 --> 38:36.563
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You don't believe him, do you?

38:36.648 --> 38:39.108
He's seriously delusional.
He needs help.

38:39.192 --> 38:42.194
Yeah. And we should
have given it to him.

38:45.281 --> 38:46.281
HELO: Doc?

38:46.366 --> 38:50.244
I didn't check Willie's blood
until a couple of hours ago.

38:50.328 --> 38:54.373
I was exhausted, and I'll admit the
Sagittarons annoy the hell out of me.

38:54.457 --> 38:56.750
And I didn't want to go
against my colleague.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.585
But you were right
about their records, Helo.

38:58.670 --> 39:01.714
There was no bittamusin
in the King boy's body.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.633
He died because it was
too late. No, he didn't.

39:04.718 --> 39:07.177
He died of acute
cell destruction.

39:07.262 --> 39:09.680
He was injected
with a toxic bisphosphonate.

39:09.764 --> 39:11.515
Now, obviously,
you got a wrong reading here.

39:11.641 --> 39:13.434
Now I don't know what
else these people... No!

39:13.518 --> 39:16.854
The old man, Mr. Buckminster,
died of the same thing.

39:16.938 --> 39:19.106
There was no
bittamusin in his system.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.692
You killed them,
you sick frak.

39:29.284 --> 39:33.996
You ought to be on your knees, thanking
me for saving your daughter's life,

39:34.080 --> 39:37.332
for having the meds
to cure her of her illness.

39:38.585 --> 39:41.462
Now you know how painful
this disease is at the end.

39:41.546 --> 39:43.005
And they don't want our help.

39:43.089 --> 39:45.632
Now, why waste time
and meds and space on them

39:45.717 --> 39:50.387
when all of those resources could
go to those who really deserve it?

39:50.472 --> 39:53.474
Who gets the medication when
there's not enough to go around?

39:53.558 --> 39:57.728
A Sagittaron who won't even raise a finger
to save his own race, or a Viper pilot?

39:57.812 --> 40:01.231
What the hell happened
to "Do no harm," Doctor?

40:01.316 --> 40:04.777
Look, I intervened because someone
has to make the tough choices here.

40:04.861 --> 40:06.070
But it doesn't matter.

40:06.154 --> 40:10.115
It doesn't matter because, look at them,
they're gonna destroy themselves anyway.

40:10.200 --> 40:12.868
I mean, look at them.
Look at them out there.

40:12.952 --> 40:17.164
They're like worms
crawling on a hot rock.

40:17.248 --> 40:20.000
Remember what you
used to say, Saul?

40:22.587 --> 40:27.966
Aside from a Cylon, is there anything
that you hate more than a Sagittaron?

40:28.051 --> 40:31.887
I'll tell you what I hate,
Mike. Being wrong.

40:36.101 --> 40:38.435
Captain Agathon.
Sir.

40:38.520 --> 40:41.939
Arrest this son of a bitch.
Gag him if you have to.

40:43.024 --> 40:44.650
My pleasure, sir.

40:48.363 --> 40:50.114
I didn't harm her.

40:51.074 --> 40:53.700
Right. She's one
of the good ones.

41:12.303 --> 41:14.346
Sir. You wanted to see me?

41:15.557 --> 41:18.058
Yes, Captain.
Please, sit down.

41:29.279 --> 41:32.322
There's hate
and there's allowing hate.

41:32.407 --> 41:35.367
Two sides of
the same coin, really.

41:35.451 --> 41:37.411
We're guilty of both.

41:42.125 --> 41:44.626
Somewhere we got lost.

41:46.546 --> 41:48.589
You being the lone voice
in the wilderness,

41:48.673 --> 41:50.841
we were bound to stay
that way for a while.

41:53.303 --> 41:56.054
This is my ship.

41:56.139 --> 41:58.432
And I owe you an apology.

42:00.018 --> 42:01.560
That's not necessary, sir.

42:01.644 --> 42:03.478
All the same,

42:05.607 --> 42:07.482
you still have it.

42:12.322 --> 42:14.489
That'll be all, Captain.
