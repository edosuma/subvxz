Yes, pet, I know.Oh, do you?

01:25.128 --> 01:27.130

And what if he is?

09:07.895 --> 09:11.638
Well, there'’s nothing more
important than family, is there?

09:11.681 --> 09:13.161

of course.

09:13.204 --> 09:14.249

10:09.913 --> 10:12.524

your assistance, Alfred.

10:12.568 --> 10:14.222
I apologize for
my sister'’s behavior.

10:14.265 --> 10:15.832
I hope you'’re not
too seriously hurt.

10:15.876 --> 10:17.617
No, I'’m fine, sir.
Thank you.

10:17.660 --> 10:18.835

10:59.484 --> 11:01.312
THOMAS: Your drunkenness
is very embarrassing.

11:01.356 --> 11:04.228
PATRICIA: I don'’t know you.

11:11.105 --> 11:12.584

11:12.628 --> 11:15.936

11:15.979 --> 11:18.068

11:18.112 --> 11:20.767

11:20.810 --> 11:22.116

11:24.858 --> 11:26.990

11:27.034 --> 11:28.470

11:28.513 --> 11:30.820
Yes.

11:30.864 --> 11:33.040
I'’ll, um--
I'’ll have this cleaned.

11:35.172 --> 11:36.826
Thank you.I'’ll get it

11:36.870 --> 11:38.045
back to you Saturday,
if you'’d like.

11:38.088 --> 11:40.656
I don'’t work Saturdays.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.789
Me neither.

11:42.832 --> 11:44.660
We could meet in the park.
It'’s gonna be a nice day.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.967
That'’s rather forward of you.

11:47.010 --> 11:48.142
No.

11:49.839 --> 11:51.580
I saw the weather forecast.

11:51.623 --> 11:52.712
Sunshine.

12:01.242 --> 12:03.679
At Downing Street today,
the prime minister asked

12:03.723 --> 12:06.029
the general public to help
in the unexplained

12:06.073 --> 12:08.553
disappearance of
Lord Rupert Longbrass.

12:08.597 --> 12:11.382
Rupert is a dear friend
and valued colleague.

12:11.426 --> 12:13.036
We are deeply concerned,

12:13.080 --> 12:14.864
and we are praying
for his safe return.Jesus, the bloke.

12:14.908 --> 12:17.475
We are confident Scotland Yard
will get to the bottom of this.

12:17.519 --> 12:20.000
What a fucking mongoose.

12:20.043 --> 12:22.132
Fuck-Fucking Rupert Longbrass.

12:22.176 --> 12:24.700
Fucking Raven Society.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.571
Fuck the No-Names.

12:26.615 --> 12:28.356
What is the Raven Society?
What'’s a No-Name?

12:28.399 --> 12:31.185
Don'’t you worry your
pretty head, my dear.

12:31.228 --> 12:34.057
Don'’t be bloody patronizing.

12:37.017 --> 12:38.714
Rupert is a banker.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.498
Looks after money
for the Raven Society.

12:40.542 --> 12:42.500
They'’re... lunatics

12:42.544 --> 12:44.502
who want to overthrow
the government

12:44.546 --> 12:46.896
and set up a fascist utopia.

12:46.940 --> 12:49.507
The No-Name League are fools

12:49.551 --> 12:50.857
who want to overthrow
the government

12:50.900 --> 12:53.511
and set up a socialist utopia.

12:53.555 --> 12:56.601
Why don'’t you arrest them all?No. No, no, no, no.

12:56.645 --> 12:59.779
We allow them to continue
so long as they don'’t
make too much noise.

13:01.171 --> 13:03.783
And Rupert'’s abduction

13:03.826 --> 13:07.134
is far too noisy.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.485
Maybe he ran away abroad,

13:10.528 --> 13:13.662
or jumped in the sea,
or off the bridge.

13:13.705 --> 13:16.665
No. No such luck.

13:16.708 --> 13:20.582
No, some hidden springs
are winding.

13:20.625 --> 13:23.280
Dark wheels are turning.

14:12.939 --> 14:15.811
Oh. My dear friend.

14:15.855 --> 14:19.423
I am deeply saddened to see you
in such circumstances.

14:19.467 --> 14:21.599
Why, Rupert?

14:21.643 --> 14:22.992
Why did you betray us?

14:23.036 --> 14:25.038
Go to hell, Harwood.

14:26.169 --> 14:28.955
We have people close to you.

14:28.998 --> 14:31.871
Very close.

14:31.914 --> 14:34.438
So we know
that you talked to someone

14:34.482 --> 14:37.920
about our plan,
but we don'’t know who.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.704
So that'’s why we're here.

14:39.748 --> 14:42.490
I need a name.

14:42.533 --> 14:44.840
And I, I need to understand...

14:44.884 --> 14:46.973
did you just become afraid?

14:47.016 --> 14:49.062
Not for myself.

14:49.105 --> 14:51.847
Afraid for my country, of what
you'’ll do if given the chance.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.154
Well, you were wrong
to be afraid.

14:54.197 --> 14:57.244
We have glorious days
ahead of us.

14:57.287 --> 14:58.593
Here we are.

14:58.636 --> 15:00.856
In this room.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.162
I wasn'’t wrong.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.431
Who did you talk to?

15:10.474 --> 15:12.694
Give me a name.

15:14.739 --> 15:16.959
Hmm?

15:32.105 --> 15:33.976
Daveboy. Bazza.

15:37.458 --> 15:38.415
Everyone all right?

15:38.459 --> 15:41.157
Aye. You?Yeah.

15:42.289 --> 15:44.117
Yeah. Look.

15:44.160 --> 15:47.381
We'’ll have a brew and then
we'’ll head for the river.

15:47.424 --> 15:48.904
Get her going then, Daveboy.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.645
Eh?

15:50.688 --> 15:52.952
How come it'’s always me
that'’s got to make the tea?

15:52.995 --> 15:55.955
I'’m not your fecking gran.SPANISH: Go on.

15:55.998 --> 15:57.086
Tastes better when you make it.

15:57.130 --> 15:58.348
Aye.

15:58.392 --> 16:00.089
Uh, that'’s because
I spunk in it,

16:00.133 --> 16:02.004
Spanish-- reminds you
of your dad.

16:02.048 --> 16:03.832
Oh, yeah?

16:03.875 --> 16:06.095
Well, at least I
know who my dad is.

16:06.139 --> 16:09.055
Hey, sit down,
Spanish.

16:19.065 --> 16:21.241
Blood?Yes, Mum.

16:21.284 --> 16:23.243
This belongs to a woman.

16:23.286 --> 16:24.984
Yes, Mum.

16:25.027 --> 16:27.116
And so the sordid
debauchery begins.

16:27.160 --> 16:28.422
Whose blood is it?

16:28.465 --> 16:29.901
Don'’t worry; it's mine.

16:29.945 --> 16:31.773
Oh, that'’s all right, then.What can you expect?

16:31.816 --> 16:35.429
Out all hours wrestling yobbos.

16:35.472 --> 16:37.431
I'’m not...

16:37.474 --> 16:39.215
It'’s a business,
I'’m starting a business.

16:39.259 --> 16:40.564
Business.

16:40.608 --> 16:42.392
Where'’s your capital?

16:42.436 --> 16:45.395
Where'’s your staff?
Where'’s your profits?

16:45.439 --> 16:47.615
You'’re a bouncer.Security consultant.

16:47.658 --> 16:50.009
Your family name and war record,

16:50.052 --> 16:52.968
you could find a very nice
position in a good household.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.404
Chauffeur, head footman.

16:54.448 --> 16:56.841
World'’s your oyster.
Do right, you'’re a butler

16:56.885 --> 16:59.279
before you'’re 40.
But no.

16:59.322 --> 17:01.063
I want to be my own man.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.325
Meaning I'’m not?

17:03.457 --> 17:05.154
I didn'’t say that.

17:05.198 --> 17:07.461
Nobody'’s their own man, son.

17:07.504 --> 17:10.942
Not me, not you, nobody.

17:10.986 --> 17:13.293
Times change.No, they don'’t.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.645
Oh, hush up,
the pair of you.

17:17.688 --> 17:19.081
You'’ll be giving
me the migraine.

17:23.216 --> 17:25.044
Who'’s this woman, then?

17:25.087 --> 17:26.697
What woman?

17:48.589 --> 17:50.069
Here you are, then.

17:51.157 --> 17:53.072
Here I am.

17:54.725 --> 17:56.336
Oh.

18:00.340 --> 18:02.255
Thank you.

18:02.298 --> 18:03.821
So, dancing, eh?

18:03.865 --> 18:06.433
That must be a lark.Oh, not really.

18:06.476 --> 18:08.391
We'’re just writhing about;
it'’s frightfully vulgar.

18:08.435 --> 18:10.959
Ah. Looks good to me.

18:13.048 --> 18:15.224
Well, it pays the rent.

18:15.268 --> 18:17.400
I won'’t be dependent
on my father.

18:17.444 --> 18:19.750
Just your old
man, is it?

18:19.794 --> 18:21.491
My mother died
when I was young.

18:21.535 --> 18:24.451
Oh.She was a dancer, too.

18:24.494 --> 18:27.106
Well, I started off
at Sadler'’s Wells,

18:27.149 --> 18:29.891
and, um, well,
then I got too hippy.

18:29.934 --> 18:31.588
I'’m an actress now.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.590
Well, actor.
Trying to be.

18:33.634 --> 18:35.157
Oh.

18:35.201 --> 18:36.463
That'’s why you
talk like that.

18:36.506 --> 18:39.161
Like what?

18:39.205 --> 18:40.597
Well, I thought
you was acting

18:40.641 --> 18:42.556
la-di-da
'’cause dancers,

18:42.599 --> 18:44.210
they don'’t need to
talk posh, do they?

18:44.253 --> 18:46.037
But acting...
that'’s different.

18:46.081 --> 18:47.996
Part of the
job, innit?

18:49.606 --> 18:51.086
I'’m not talking posh.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.132
This is my normal accent.

18:53.175 --> 18:55.743
And it'’s a
bloody good one.

18:58.876 --> 19:00.530
So, you'’re an
actress, then?

19:00.574 --> 19:02.184
Yeah, just
silly things, so far.

19:02.228 --> 19:04.317
But, um, I'’m in a play
at the moment, actually,

19:04.360 --> 19:06.145
which might be
quite good.
Oh.

19:06.188 --> 19:07.668
Well, the part'’s good,
anyway.

19:07.711 --> 19:09.539
It'’s just in some grotty
little pub theater,

19:09.583 --> 19:11.802
but you never know.I like a good play.

19:11.846 --> 19:14.196
What'’s that one
with the, um...

19:14.240 --> 19:15.937
pirate and
the crocodile?

19:15.980 --> 19:18.200
Peter Pan?
Yeah, that'’s
the one.

19:18.244 --> 19:19.593
I saw it in the army.

19:19.636 --> 19:21.812
The crocodile, he'’s always
creeping up on people.

19:21.856 --> 19:23.945
"Behind you!"

19:23.988 --> 19:25.729
You'’d swear it
was a real animal.

19:25.773 --> 19:27.340
It'’s a bloody good show.

19:28.471 --> 19:29.864
You were in the army?

19:29.907 --> 19:31.779
Ten years.

19:31.822 --> 19:33.781
I'’m against all that.

19:33.824 --> 19:36.175
Against all what?

19:36.218 --> 19:38.089
Wars.

19:38.133 --> 19:39.917
Army, killing.

19:39.961 --> 19:41.528
The whole
grotesque charade.

19:56.412 --> 19:59.372
Have you ever... you know?

20:00.503 --> 20:01.852
Now and then.

20:03.463 --> 20:05.465
You'’ve killed people?

20:05.508 --> 20:07.510
Came with the job.

20:07.554 --> 20:10.644
How could you?
Didn'’t it... bother you?

20:11.775 --> 20:13.647
Still does.

20:15.170 --> 20:17.477
When my sergeant major
gave me my first gun,

20:17.520 --> 20:19.827
he said,
"This is not your gun.

20:19.870 --> 20:22.046
"This is
the queen'’s gun.

20:22.090 --> 20:24.658
And these bullets,
they'’re the queen's bullets."

20:26.399 --> 20:28.009
I was working
for the queen.

20:28.052 --> 20:30.359
Makes it all right,
do you see?

20:32.448 --> 20:33.841
No. No, not really.

20:36.757 --> 20:38.193
Well...

20:38.237 --> 20:40.195
I'’ll have no more
to do with it now.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.197
Violence.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.721
No more. Peaceful life for me.

20:44.765 --> 20:46.245
You'’ve no worries there.

20:47.898 --> 20:49.639
You do seem like a gentle man.

20:53.295 --> 20:55.210
So go on, then.
Give us some of your play.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.299
Oh, God, no.Oh, go on, please.

20:57.343 --> 20:59.258
No, no, no.
Really, no.
Well, what'’s
your character called?

20:59.301 --> 21:00.911
"The sister."

21:00.955 --> 21:03.262
The sister. Big part, is it?

21:08.267 --> 21:09.877
You'’re blind, Johnny.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.009
Blind.

21:12.053 --> 21:13.315
You don'’t see
me, damn you.

21:13.359 --> 21:15.317
You see only a mask.

21:15.361 --> 21:16.536
A glittering, mirrored mask

21:16.579 --> 21:17.841
of your own dark,
polluted soul.

21:17.885 --> 21:20.409
Oh, steady on."Don'’t cry."

21:20.453 --> 21:22.542
Don'’t cry?

21:22.585 --> 21:23.978
Fuck you, Johnny.

21:24.021 --> 21:25.849
I would drown you
in my tears if I could.

21:25.893 --> 21:27.198
I would kill you.

21:31.464 --> 21:33.727
Anyway.

21:33.770 --> 21:36.033
It'’s just something
like that.

21:37.165 --> 21:39.733
No crocodiles, then?

21:39.776 --> 21:41.256
No.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.866
No animals at
all, I'’m afraid.

21:42.910 --> 21:44.520
Well, that was very good.

21:44.564 --> 21:45.913
I was scared.

21:45.956 --> 21:47.306
Thank you.

22:58.594 --> 23:01.728
Hello, love.

23:01.771 --> 23:04.774
Would you like a boiled sweet?

23:06.820 --> 23:10.389
HARWOOD:
I saw your last varsity match.

23:10.432 --> 23:11.955
Took four wickets.

23:11.999 --> 23:14.436
Quite the glamour boy.

23:14.480 --> 23:17.004
All the women
were madly in love.

23:17.047 --> 23:19.441
We often wondered...

23:19.485 --> 23:21.095
why you married Philippa.

23:22.966 --> 23:25.316
A barren marriage,
is it not?

23:25.360 --> 23:28.363
What a terribly bleak
phrase that is.

23:28.407 --> 23:31.018
Leaves a hole, I'’d imagine.

23:31.061 --> 23:33.890
Emotionally.

23:33.934 --> 23:36.284
Now, correct me if I'’m wrong,

23:36.327 --> 23:39.330
but it'’s Philippa
who has the problem, not you.

23:39.374 --> 23:41.420
You'’re perfectly capable
of siring children.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.639
No.

23:44.771 --> 23:46.555
No? You'’re not?

23:48.514 --> 23:50.690
Hmm.

23:50.733 --> 23:53.432
Perhaps we'’ve been given
some faulty information.

23:56.522 --> 23:58.219
Sykes, come in!

24:10.710 --> 24:13.800
Good day to you, young man.

24:13.843 --> 24:17.412
Now, don'’t be afraid.
No one wants to hurt you.

24:17.456 --> 24:20.546
But this is a matter
of national importance.

24:20.589 --> 24:23.244
So I'’m going to ask you
to be totally honest with me.

24:24.375 --> 24:26.334
What'’s your name?

24:26.377 --> 24:28.815
Martin, sir.

24:28.858 --> 24:30.817
Martin Falconer.

24:30.860 --> 24:32.471
What'’s your
father'’s name?

24:34.124 --> 24:36.126
You'’re a bastard, aren't you?

24:36.170 --> 24:39.216
Yes, sir. I-I am.

24:39.260 --> 24:42.263
My father'’s
a very important man.

24:42.306 --> 24:43.873
I'’m not--

24:43.917 --> 24:46.093
He'’s not at liberty
to acknowledge...

24:46.136 --> 24:48.138
Stop.

24:48.182 --> 24:50.314
Yes, thank you, Martin.
That'’s enough.

24:50.358 --> 24:51.794
You'’re a very brave boy

24:51.838 --> 24:53.840
and you'’ve done your country
a great service.

24:53.883 --> 24:55.363
Thank you, Sykes.

25:06.766 --> 25:08.202
Fine young man.

25:08.245 --> 25:09.551
You must be very proud.

25:14.338 --> 25:15.992
Give me the name.

25:23.260 --> 25:24.827
Thomas Wayne.

25:30.616 --> 25:32.313
Hmm.

25:52.507 --> 25:54.161
Hello, Mother.

25:54.204 --> 25:56.685
Yes, I put her on the plane
about three hours ago.

25:56.729 --> 25:59.470
She was spitting mad,
but sober at least.

26:01.516 --> 26:04.214
My work is going fine,
thank you.

26:04.258 --> 26:07.653
I believe that I might'’ve
uncovered a large fraud.

26:07.696 --> 26:09.350
In fact, I'’m working on it
right now,

26:09.393 --> 26:12.005
so maybe I should just...

26:12.048 --> 26:14.094
Oh?

26:14.137 --> 26:15.922
Did she?

26:17.793 --> 26:20.666
Well, send her my regards.

26:20.709 --> 26:22.581
No, Mother.

26:22.624 --> 26:24.104
Just my regards.

26:53.829 --> 26:56.789
Go and tell those
useless buggers they missed.

26:56.832 --> 26:58.704
He'’s away.

27:16.852 --> 27:18.593
Bloody idiots.

27:43.400 --> 27:44.706
I'’m nervous...

27:44.750 --> 27:46.882
about meeting
your parents.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.363
Are you?

27:49.406 --> 27:51.931
No.I am.

27:54.063 --> 27:55.717
Why do you like me?

27:55.761 --> 27:57.980
What sort of question'’s that?

27:58.024 --> 27:59.634
Jolly easy one, I should think.

28:03.769 --> 28:05.727
You make me feel like
anything is possible.

28:05.771 --> 28:07.773
Good answer.

28:07.816 --> 28:09.818
Just in time.Well, I was
gonna say I like

28:09.862 --> 28:11.472
your boobs, but I thought
better of it.

28:11.515 --> 28:13.169
I'’m learning,

28:13.213 --> 28:15.171
see?

28:15.215 --> 28:16.695
Fair play. Now you.

28:17.826 --> 28:19.132
You'’re very alive.

28:19.175 --> 28:21.351
Well, that'’s not saying much,
is it?

28:21.395 --> 28:23.745
"Alive"? You could leave me
for that potted plant.

28:23.789 --> 28:25.225
No, seriously.

28:25.268 --> 28:29.359
Sometimes,
I don'’t feel very alive.

28:31.492 --> 28:32.798
You bring me back to life.

28:43.939 --> 28:46.072
That'’s the best thing
anyone'’s ever said to me.

29:00.739 --> 29:04.307
It'’s very nice to meet
you at last, Esme.

29:04.351 --> 29:06.396
Where did you get those
earrings? They'’re very unusual.

29:06.440 --> 29:08.834
ESME: Oh, thank you,
Mrs. Pennyworth-- uh, Mary.

29:08.877 --> 29:10.487
Um, they'’re
from India.

29:10.531 --> 29:12.838
MARY:
Oh. Alfred was
in India,

29:12.881 --> 29:14.883
weren'’t you? Brought me back
a lovely tablecloth.

29:14.927 --> 29:16.189
Didn'’t tell me that.

29:16.232 --> 29:18.191
He won medals there.

29:18.234 --> 29:20.280
Nish, Mum.Well, you did.

29:20.323 --> 29:23.022
He'’s so modest.
Never talks about what he did.

29:23.065 --> 29:24.763
Rules, Mum.

29:24.806 --> 29:27.809
Esme, what,
what does your father do?

29:27.853 --> 29:30.899
He'’s a vicar,
Mr. Pennyworth.

29:30.943 --> 29:33.206
Well, more of a dean,
of Salisbury.

29:33.249 --> 29:35.599
Ah. More of a dean.

29:35.643 --> 29:36.992
Of Salisbury.

29:39.908 --> 29:41.605
More beef, Esme?

29:41.649 --> 29:44.260
No, thank you, Mary. It'’s
ever so scrumptious, though.

29:44.304 --> 29:46.654
What does your father
think of your acting career?

29:46.697 --> 29:47.873
MARY:
Don'’t mind him, Esme,

29:47.916 --> 29:49.222
he'’ll be rude if he likes.

29:49.265 --> 29:52.051
It'’s a perfectly polite
question, love.

29:52.094 --> 29:55.837
Acting'’s a respectable
profession...

29:55.881 --> 29:58.187
nowadays.

30:00.755 --> 30:03.018
Uh, my father doesn'’t approve,

30:03.062 --> 30:05.455
Mr. Pennyworth.

30:05.499 --> 30:07.283
But he'’s willing to let me try.

30:07.327 --> 30:10.243
He believes that young people
should have adventures.

30:11.374 --> 30:13.115
Good for him, eh?

30:13.159 --> 30:14.551
Adventures.

30:14.595 --> 30:17.119
He approves of Alfred,
then, does he?

30:17.163 --> 30:20.383
I'’m sure he'll like
Alfred very much.

30:20.427 --> 30:21.994
Oh, he'’s not met him?

30:22.037 --> 30:23.865
But you think he'’ll like him?

30:23.909 --> 30:25.867
Good.

30:25.911 --> 30:27.869
Oh, I'’m sure they'll have
a great deal to talk about.

30:27.913 --> 30:29.697
My word, yes. A great deal.

30:29.740 --> 30:31.481
I think you'’ve had
enough sherry, Dad.

30:31.525 --> 30:35.050
Who'’s to say? Who's to say?

30:35.094 --> 30:37.052
So sorry, Esme.

30:38.401 --> 30:39.838
ESME:
It'’s quite all right.

30:45.321 --> 30:46.801
ALFRED:
Listen...

30:46.845 --> 30:48.411
Don'’t apologize.
You have a wonderful family.

30:48.455 --> 30:50.022
You should be
very proud of them.

30:50.065 --> 30:52.067
No, I wasn'’t gonna apologize.
I am proud of them.

30:52.111 --> 30:53.721
I was just gonna say
I'’m not my family.

30:53.764 --> 30:55.723
I'’m not my dad.

30:55.766 --> 30:57.725
You know, uh,
they'’re a part of me,

30:57.768 --> 30:59.466
yeah, but they'’re not all of me.

30:59.509 --> 31:01.511
And you'’re not just a vicar's
daughter, either, are you?

31:01.555 --> 31:03.339
No. No, I'’m not.

31:03.383 --> 31:05.037
But it made me
think about us.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.777
Yeah, I was thinking, too.

31:06.821 --> 31:09.476
As soon as I get my first good
contract, we should rent a flat.

31:09.519 --> 31:11.434
We'’ll move in together.

31:13.567 --> 31:15.090
Ez?

31:17.179 --> 31:19.660
Alfred, I love you so much.

31:19.703 --> 31:21.705
And I wish, I-I wish
we could just go away

31:21.749 --> 31:23.794
and live on a desert island
together, but we can'’t.

31:23.838 --> 31:24.926
We'’re here.

31:26.275 --> 31:29.888
What'’s wrong with here?

31:33.500 --> 31:35.197
One day, I want to be married.

31:35.241 --> 31:37.504
And I want to have a nice
little house with a garden

31:37.547 --> 31:39.375
and children and a
dog and all of that.

31:39.419 --> 31:40.594
We can have that.

31:40.637 --> 31:41.900
Alfred, you work
in a nightclub.

31:41.943 --> 31:44.685
I have plans.
You know I have.

31:44.728 --> 31:46.513
Well, what'’s our future?
Where is this going?

31:46.556 --> 31:47.949
How are we going to live?

31:47.993 --> 31:49.603
What if we end up
poor, squabbling

31:49.646 --> 31:51.779
in some squalid little flat...Look,

31:51.822 --> 31:53.433
I'’m gonna make something
of myself, Ez.

31:53.476 --> 31:55.435
I am.

31:55.478 --> 31:57.437
I know you are.

31:57.480 --> 31:59.569
Well, I hope you are.

31:59.613 --> 32:00.788
I think we both come
from different worlds,

32:00.831 --> 32:02.746
and I think it'’s too difficult.

32:02.790 --> 32:05.314
I'’m sorry.

32:05.358 --> 32:07.490
I'’m going to go.

32:21.722 --> 32:24.420
Alfie!

32:24.464 --> 32:25.856
Alfie!

32:25.900 --> 32:27.597
Alfie!

32:33.386 --> 32:35.692
Esme!

32:37.912 --> 32:38.739
Alfie!

32:50.316 --> 32:52.840
Call us when you'’ve got
Thomas Wayne. We'’ll do a swap.

32:54.059 --> 32:55.799
You'’ve got till tomorrow.

33:11.076 --> 33:13.078
Who'’s Thomas Wayne?

33:17.821 --> 33:19.649
There'’s been
a kidnapping.

33:19.693 --> 33:22.304
Is that right, sir?My girlfriend,
Esme Winikus.

33:22.348 --> 33:24.959
Uh, she was took
by a blond lady in a gray car,

33:25.003 --> 33:26.700
no plates,
took her off the street.

33:26.743 --> 33:28.354
Slow down, son.

33:28.397 --> 33:29.964
Have you been drinking?

33:30.008 --> 33:31.661
No. Here.

33:31.705 --> 33:33.141
They left a note. Look.

33:38.277 --> 33:40.670
One moment, sir.

33:40.714 --> 33:42.759
Yeah.

33:53.161 --> 33:54.510
Oi?

33:54.554 --> 33:56.686
Hello?

34:24.758 --> 34:25.933
Hello?

34:25.976 --> 34:27.891
SYKES:
What you playing at?

34:27.935 --> 34:30.503
Old Bill can'’t help you.

34:30.546 --> 34:32.679
Fetch Thomas Wayne
like I told you.

34:32.722 --> 34:34.289
I don'’t know who he is.

34:34.333 --> 34:37.510
For Esme'’s sake,
I hope you'’re lying.

34:37.553 --> 34:39.512
What a smasher she is, eh?

34:39.555 --> 34:42.210
Skin like silk.I swear to God...

34:42.254 --> 34:43.864
Bring us the yank.

34:49.174 --> 34:51.089
The yank?

35:03.231 --> 35:05.233
What'’s wrong?

35:05.277 --> 35:07.670
Nothing, Mum.
Business.

35:07.714 --> 35:09.107
Oh, that'’s good.

35:09.150 --> 35:11.457
Business is good, isn'’t it?

35:18.464 --> 35:20.596
I'’ll put the kettle on, then.

35:23.947 --> 35:26.646
OPERATOR:
The service requested
is not available.

35:26.689 --> 35:28.430
Please replace...

35:43.402 --> 35:46.970
You watch. The bitch
will miss that gate.

35:55.936 --> 35:57.459
Mr. Batley?

36:02.725 --> 36:04.379
I'’m gonna say a name.

36:04.423 --> 36:06.207
And you are gonna tell us

36:06.251 --> 36:07.991
everything you know
about that name.

36:08.035 --> 36:09.341
Understand?

36:11.299 --> 36:13.649
Thomas Wayne.

36:14.998 --> 36:16.957
Renting Wexdale Farm.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.526
I put in high-voltage cabling,
he didn'’t say what for.

36:20.569 --> 36:22.876
Paid in cash, quick as you like.

36:22.919 --> 36:25.226
Nice chap. Yank.

36:28.055 --> 36:31.101
Thanks for your time.

36:34.235 --> 36:36.150
Cheers.

36:43.853 --> 36:45.768
No.

36:48.031 --> 36:49.859
You all right?

36:49.903 --> 36:51.774
Magic.

36:51.818 --> 36:53.733
Auld lang syne, eh?

36:53.776 --> 36:57.258
Daveboy, you understand that
we'’re not here to blot anyone?

36:57.302 --> 37:00.435
Oh, aye. Aye, understood.

37:02.959 --> 37:04.352
Piece of cake, Alfie.

37:04.396 --> 37:06.876
No dogs, no sentries.

37:20.542 --> 37:22.849
Hands on your head, now!

37:22.892 --> 37:24.633
You'’re Thomas Wayne?

37:25.852 --> 37:27.462
No.

37:27.506 --> 37:30.378
I am Thomas Wayne.

37:30.422 --> 37:32.162
ALFRED:
Anyone else here?No.

37:33.468 --> 37:35.383
Where'’s your phone?

37:37.516 --> 37:38.821
Uh...

37:42.085 --> 37:44.262
Well, whatever
you'’re being paid,

37:44.305 --> 37:47.308
I am willing and able
to pay far more.

37:47.352 --> 37:49.267
Name a price.Quiet.

37:49.310 --> 37:50.659
DAVEBOY:
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

37:50.703 --> 37:52.052
h-hold on, now.

37:52.095 --> 37:53.445
He said "name a price."

37:55.055 --> 37:56.317
BAZZA:
Hush.

37:58.058 --> 38:00.234
SYKES : Hello.I have him.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.236
Smashing.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.064
Meet us at Wormwood Scrubs,
east gates

38:04.107 --> 38:06.066
in two hours.No, I need more time.

38:06.109 --> 38:07.459
Make it dawn.

38:09.591 --> 38:11.332
Dawn, then.

38:11.376 --> 38:12.551
Now let me speak to Esme.

38:12.594 --> 38:13.813
Sorry, duck.

38:13.856 --> 38:15.641
It'’s more than my job's worth.

38:15.684 --> 38:20.298
And if you'’re thinking
of any skullduggery, think on.

38:24.084 --> 38:25.564
Tell me everything
you know

38:25.607 --> 38:27.261
about these people who want you.

38:27.305 --> 38:30.569
I don'’t know who they are.

38:30.612 --> 38:32.440
You'’re the doorman from
that nightclub, aren'’t you?

38:32.484 --> 38:33.876
Excuse my memory.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.444
What was your name?Never you mind.

38:36.488 --> 38:38.098
Talk.

38:42.581 --> 38:45.801
I'’m a financial
forensics analyst.

38:45.845 --> 38:48.282
I recently discovered
a banking fraud,

38:48.326 --> 38:50.676
a-a large, illicit transfer
of money evidently connected

38:50.719 --> 38:53.331
to some far-reaching
criminal conspiracy.

38:53.374 --> 38:55.463
I don'’t know who the
conspirators are yet,

38:55.507 --> 38:58.161
but they have already
tried to kill me.

38:58.205 --> 38:59.989
I assume Esme is somebody
very close to you,

39:00.033 --> 39:02.383
so I can'’t appeal to your
compassion or your avarice,

39:02.427 --> 39:04.951
but I do appeal
to your reason.

39:04.994 --> 39:08.607
If they kill me,
they have to kill you.

39:08.650 --> 39:10.260
They can'’t afford
to have any loose ends.

39:10.304 --> 39:11.436
The stakes are too high.

39:11.479 --> 39:13.612
There will be no "exchange."

39:13.655 --> 39:16.049
That'’s possible.

39:16.092 --> 39:18.965
If you have some alternative
plan, I'’m happy to listen.

39:19.008 --> 39:22.708
I am not qualified
to formulate such a plan.

39:22.751 --> 39:26.233
No. I can'’t think
of anything either.

39:26.276 --> 39:28.322
You, Bazza?

39:28.366 --> 39:30.324
Nothing comes to mind.

39:32.457 --> 39:35.808
Um, you'’re not gonna
ask my opinion, no?

39:37.549 --> 39:39.333
Fair play.

39:39.377 --> 39:42.162
You got a better plan?

39:42.205 --> 39:44.164
No.

39:44.207 --> 39:45.470
I might'’ve though.

39:45.513 --> 39:48.386
It'’s the principle.

39:56.263 --> 39:58.221
Cheer up, pet.

39:58.265 --> 40:00.093
Shall I make you
a nice cupper and a biscuit?

40:00.136 --> 40:01.616
It'’ll sort you right out.

40:02.965 --> 40:05.359
I didn'’t do anything.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.230
I don'’t know anything.

40:07.274 --> 40:08.928
Please don'’t hurt me.

40:08.971 --> 40:10.451
Relax.

40:10.495 --> 40:12.627
I won'’t bite.

40:12.671 --> 40:14.281
We'’ve other staff for that.

40:18.503 --> 40:22.507
Hey, your boyfriend, he'’s
a right character, isn'’t he?

40:25.031 --> 40:29.339
He thinks you'’ve got
gold knickers on, that one.

40:44.659 --> 40:47.227
Is Esme your wife?

40:48.533 --> 40:50.012
No.

40:52.101 --> 40:54.887
Girlfriend?

40:54.930 --> 40:56.932
Well, as it happens,
she dumped me about a minute

40:56.976 --> 40:59.282
before your friends took her.

40:59.326 --> 41:02.416
Well, why would she do that?

41:02.460 --> 41:04.766
Not good enough for her.

41:09.075 --> 41:12.121
Well, perhaps you'’re
better off without her.

41:12.165 --> 41:15.429
Perhaps you'’re selling our
lives for an unworthy woman.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.910
Uh, you'’ll, you'll
forgive my bluntness.

41:17.953 --> 41:20.652
I don'’t want to die.

41:20.695 --> 41:23.089
Married, are you?

41:23.132 --> 41:26.179
No. Wait, I don'’t want to know.

41:26.222 --> 41:28.573
I'’m not.

41:28.616 --> 41:30.966
Well, good.

41:34.056 --> 41:36.711
I ask one favor.

41:36.755 --> 41:39.540
In the unlikely event
that you survive me,

41:39.584 --> 41:42.456
please tell my parents that
I faced death honorably.

41:44.937 --> 41:46.895
Really?

41:46.939 --> 41:48.418
That'’s what you want to say?

41:48.462 --> 41:50.856
Why not?

41:50.899 --> 41:54.555
Well, it'’s your shout, mate.

41:57.384 --> 41:59.168
I'’ll do my best
to keep you alive,

41:59.212 --> 42:03.999
but if things go pear-shaped,
I'’ll tell them that.

42:04.043 --> 42:05.697
And it'’s true.

42:05.740 --> 42:08.090
You'’ve been very decent
about all this.

42:09.962 --> 42:13.052
My name'’s Alfred Pennyworth,
by the way.

42:13.095 --> 42:15.968
Well, Mr. Pennyworth,

42:16.011 --> 42:17.796
I urge you to reconsider.

42:40.340 --> 42:42.864
Everyone in the car, step
out with your hands raised.

42:45.475 --> 42:46.433
Let me see Esme!

42:46.476 --> 42:49.262
She'’s not there.

42:49.305 --> 42:51.612
Step out of the car
with your hands raised.

42:51.656 --> 42:52.570
I told you.

42:55.485 --> 42:56.661
Not until I see her.

42:56.704 --> 42:58.880
Step out of the car.
Do it now!

43:01.796 --> 43:04.625
Okay. Okay.

43:04.669 --> 43:06.279
We'’re coming.

43:08.368 --> 43:10.544
Get down on the floor
and brace yourself.

43:40.574 --> 43:43.925
SYKES:
Hear tell you'’re
a dancer, are you?

43:46.798 --> 43:50.671
Speak up.Yes.

43:50.715 --> 43:52.847
Any good?

43:52.891 --> 43:54.544
Not really.

43:54.588 --> 43:55.850
Go on.

43:55.894 --> 44:00.072
I'’ll bet you're
a right cracker, innit you?

44:01.943 --> 44:03.771
I love dancing, me.

44:20.353 --> 44:21.659
Hello?

44:21.702 --> 44:23.312
ALFRED:
Your team is all fucked.

44:23.356 --> 44:25.619
This is completely
bloody unnecessary!

44:25.663 --> 44:27.490
Bet some of these lads
have wives and children.

44:27.534 --> 44:29.797
Oh, I know. Bless.

44:29.841 --> 44:31.277
What do you want to do now?

44:31.320 --> 44:32.800
Start again.

44:32.844 --> 44:34.541
Same deal. Wayne for Esme.

44:34.584 --> 44:36.151
Only this time,
don'’t fuck about.

44:36.195 --> 44:39.894
If you do, Wayne goes
to the U.S. Embassy.

44:39.938 --> 44:42.549
Where and when?

44:42.592 --> 44:45.465
Let me speak to Esme.
There'’s no deal

44:45.508 --> 44:46.684
if I don'’t speak to her.

44:57.912 --> 44:59.087
Hello?

44:59.131 --> 45:01.046
Esme, are you all right?

45:01.089 --> 45:02.700
No.

45:02.743 --> 45:05.006
Have they hurt you?No.

45:05.050 --> 45:07.443
Okay. Look,
everything'’s gonna be all right.

45:07.487 --> 45:08.880
I'’m coming to get you.Yes. Please.

45:08.923 --> 45:10.098
No one'’s gonna hurt you.

45:10.142 --> 45:11.970
It'’s just a misunderstand...

45:12.013 --> 45:14.537
Where and when?

45:14.581 --> 45:16.757
Camden Town tube station.

45:16.801 --> 45:18.716
6:00 this evening.

45:25.810 --> 45:28.551
Well, holy moly, guys,
can'’t you see?

45:28.595 --> 45:30.075
They'’re going to do the
exact same thing again.

45:30.118 --> 45:31.119
She won'’t be there.

45:31.163 --> 45:33.078
Oh. You don'’t think so?

45:33.121 --> 45:35.080
I can assure you.

45:35.123 --> 45:36.516
She will not be there.

45:36.559 --> 45:37.909
DAVEBOY:
Oh, we'’re safe now, boys.

45:37.952 --> 45:41.260
Fucking Napoleon'’s here.

45:41.303 --> 45:43.566
Lads?

45:43.610 --> 45:45.743
One of you is taking us
to Esme sharpish,

45:45.786 --> 45:47.353
or there'’ll be
serious grief.

45:47.396 --> 45:48.876
I'’m not messing about.

45:48.920 --> 45:51.139
I mean it.

45:51.183 --> 45:52.227
Alfie, man.

45:52.271 --> 45:55.100
Step over here.
Step over here.

45:57.232 --> 45:59.757
Right. You heard the man.

45:59.800 --> 46:01.454
Now which one of you two
grizzling bastards

46:01.497 --> 46:02.672
wants to live?

46:02.716 --> 46:04.109
Fuck you!

46:05.501 --> 46:07.155
Jesus.

46:07.199 --> 46:08.983
Why'’d you do that?

46:09.027 --> 46:11.507
That was a convincer.

46:11.551 --> 46:14.772
Now your man'’s convinced,
isn'’t he?

46:14.815 --> 46:15.947
Aren'’t you?

46:15.990 --> 46:18.688
Harwood House. Sussex.

46:21.300 --> 46:23.215
In the basement.

46:23.258 --> 46:25.478
See? No bother.

46:25.521 --> 46:27.349
We'’re not bloody animals.

46:27.393 --> 46:31.223
Oh, fuck.
Alfred, was that wrong?

46:31.266 --> 46:33.486
Well, I just did it.

46:33.529 --> 46:35.531
That'’s me, eh?

46:38.926 --> 46:42.321
♪ Something'’s gotten hold
of my heart ♪

46:42.364 --> 46:47.848
♪ Keeping my soul
and my senses apart ♪

46:49.458 --> 46:53.898
♪ Something'’s gotten
into my life ♪

46:53.941 --> 46:58.206
♪ Cutting its way
through my dreams like a knife ♪

46:58.250 --> 47:01.862
♪ Turning me up

47:01.906 --> 47:04.343
♪ Turning me down

47:04.386 --> 47:07.912
♪ Making me smile

47:07.955 --> 47:09.827
♪ And making me frown

47:12.003 --> 47:13.178
Bitch!

47:16.659 --> 47:17.573
You!

47:44.731 --> 47:45.645
Help!

47:48.778 --> 47:51.216
Help!
I'’m being held captive!

47:54.872 --> 47:56.003
Very sorry, Your Lordship, sir.

47:56.047 --> 47:57.396
Won'’t happen again.

47:57.439 --> 47:59.572
Take her back downstairs.

47:59.615 --> 48:02.836
Tell Mr. Parslow
to take charge of her.

48:02.880 --> 48:05.447
And you go home. Immediately.

48:05.491 --> 48:07.058
Your incompetence will be
dealt with tomorrow.

48:07.101 --> 48:08.668
Sir.

48:12.367 --> 48:14.456
I'’m sorry about the intrusion,

48:14.500 --> 48:15.675
ladies and gentlemen.

48:15.718 --> 48:16.850
My work

48:16.894 --> 48:19.287
for the country is honorable
and necessary.

48:19.331 --> 48:22.160
Sometimes ugly.

48:22.203 --> 48:24.118
I'’m afraid we're gonna have
to cut the evening short.

48:26.338 --> 48:27.643
Thank you for coming.

48:57.325 --> 48:58.631
Mr. Aziz, sir.

49:01.764 --> 49:04.289
All of them are
wearing these.

49:04.332 --> 49:05.638
Raven Society.

49:05.681 --> 49:09.990
Just our ruddy luck.
Be a dear.

49:10.034 --> 49:12.166
Call the Downing Street wallahs
and tell them we have a problem.

49:29.836 --> 49:31.881
If you don'’t hear
from me in one hour,

49:31.925 --> 49:33.796
then you take him to the
American Embassy.

49:36.234 --> 49:38.192
If the swap'’s still on,
I'’ll call the phone box.

49:38.236 --> 49:40.847
Three rings means
bring him in.

49:40.890 --> 49:42.501
Righto.

49:42.544 --> 49:44.633
And no coming in after me
unless I ring three times.

49:44.677 --> 49:45.852
That'’s an order.

49:45.895 --> 49:47.245
See him.

49:47.288 --> 49:50.074
When were you promoted?An order.

49:50.117 --> 49:53.033
If I may, sir...No, you may not.

49:53.077 --> 49:56.210
Okay.One hour.

49:56.254 --> 49:57.690
Then go to the embassy.

50:07.526 --> 50:09.223
Hello.

50:12.052 --> 50:14.054
You will be Miss... Winikus.

50:24.064 --> 50:25.283
What are you going to do?

50:25.326 --> 50:28.677
Oh, I don'’t decide what I do.

50:28.721 --> 50:29.852
That'’s what the governor does.

50:35.423 --> 50:36.859
Sit down there,
will you please, miss?

50:46.478 --> 50:48.175
Sit.

51:46.146 --> 51:47.756
Good evening, madam.

51:48.888 --> 51:50.237
Tell me,

51:50.281 --> 51:51.804
where would I find
the young lady captive?

51:56.461 --> 51:57.723
If you please?

52:01.030 --> 52:02.162
Thanks.

52:32.192 --> 52:34.847
You might gorge

52:34.890 --> 52:37.632
on this dairy product.

52:37.676 --> 52:39.939
Seven letters,

52:39.982 --> 52:42.115
ending in "R."

52:44.204 --> 52:46.119
Please.

52:46.163 --> 52:47.990
Please, I beg of you,
just let me go.

52:49.818 --> 52:52.517
I do understand
your frustration, miss.

52:52.560 --> 52:56.956
There'’s a proper
hoo-ha upstairs.

52:56.999 --> 52:58.871
We'’ll get started
soon as they sort it out.

52:58.914 --> 53:01.395
Fuck off and die.

53:05.007 --> 53:06.139
Cheddar.

53:14.321 --> 53:17.194
Thank you for
coming, Alfred.

53:19.326 --> 53:21.850
My name is Lord Harwood.

53:21.894 --> 53:23.330
How do you do?

53:23.374 --> 53:26.942
Have you heard
of the Raven Society?

53:26.986 --> 53:29.162
You run a gang of
herberts with guns.

53:29.206 --> 53:30.511
The Old Bill are scared of you.

53:30.555 --> 53:32.948
You'’re some kind of
secret gestapo.

53:32.992 --> 53:34.559
Not at all.

53:34.602 --> 53:37.910
We have no silly
Gothic regalia or skulls.

53:37.953 --> 53:40.260
Just dedicated patriots
with no need for public acclaim.

53:40.304 --> 53:41.957
And you'’re the top man, are you?

53:42.001 --> 53:44.395
A simple foot soldier.

53:44.438 --> 53:46.527
If I don'’t call my colleagues
inside the next ten minutes,

53:46.571 --> 53:47.833
they'’re coming in.

53:47.876 --> 53:50.009
Well, unless you have a
battalion of colleagues,

53:50.052 --> 53:51.924
I rather fancy
that we'’ll survive.

53:51.967 --> 53:55.493
Please understand,
I wish neither you

53:55.536 --> 53:57.495
nor Esme any harm.

53:57.538 --> 53:59.061
All I want is Thomas Wayne.

53:59.105 --> 54:02.587
Or rather, his silence.
And I will have it.

54:02.630 --> 54:04.241
With your help or without.

54:04.284 --> 54:07.592
So why are we talking then?Your army report states that

54:07.635 --> 54:09.768
you'’re a quartermaster
in the Catering Corps.

54:13.424 --> 54:15.077
That'’s not strictly true, is it?

54:15.121 --> 54:18.255
The army never lies.

54:18.298 --> 54:20.213
SAS, I presume? Hmm?

54:20.257 --> 54:24.522
You tell me.I think you know, Alfred,

54:24.565 --> 54:26.306
that this great
nation of ours

54:26.350 --> 54:30.005
is at war with itself.

54:30.049 --> 54:33.313
The forces of order
and virtue battling

54:33.357 --> 54:35.576
extreme evil.Still...

54:35.620 --> 54:36.882
mustn'’t grumble.

54:36.925 --> 54:41.103
You know what
this country needs?

54:41.147 --> 54:42.322
Love.

54:42.366 --> 54:45.238
Only the love
of true patriots

54:45.282 --> 54:48.067
can pull this country out of
the vile quagmire of immorality

54:48.110 --> 54:51.157
and corruption and sin
into which it has fallen.

54:51.200 --> 54:53.115
And the battle begins very soon.

54:53.159 --> 54:56.118
What battle?Well...

54:56.162 --> 54:58.164
I speak figuratively.
Technically,

54:58.207 --> 54:59.905
you'’d have to call it
a coup d'’état.

54:59.948 --> 55:01.689
What do you think of that?

55:01.733 --> 55:04.562
As a rule, if you have to use
French words for something,

55:04.605 --> 55:05.737
I don'’t like it.

55:07.869 --> 55:09.697
We will take back this country

55:09.741 --> 55:11.308
from the corrupt weaklings

55:11.351 --> 55:14.398
in the name of the queen
and of strong British patriots.

55:14.441 --> 55:16.661
Does the queen know?

55:16.704 --> 55:19.446
No. Not yet.

55:19.490 --> 55:22.449
But if Her Majesty does not wish
for the moral rebirth

55:22.493 --> 55:24.756
of this country, then there are
many in the royal family

55:24.799 --> 55:25.844
who certainly do.

55:28.542 --> 55:31.153
We will succeed.

55:31.197 --> 55:34.592
But the struggle will be
hard and cruel,

55:34.635 --> 55:36.855
as all noble struggles are.

55:36.898 --> 55:38.291
We'’ll need men like you.

55:38.335 --> 55:41.686
Strong men.You'’re offering me a job.

55:41.729 --> 55:43.427
No. A mission.

55:43.470 --> 55:46.343
And what would
I be doing, exactly?

55:46.386 --> 55:48.040
Radical change
inevitably requires

55:48.083 --> 55:49.258
a degree of
physical force.

55:49.302 --> 55:52.305
Violence, you mean?Well, that is

55:52.349 --> 55:53.306
your métier, is it not?

55:53.350 --> 55:55.264
There you go again.

55:55.308 --> 55:58.180
That was foreigners,
for the queen.

55:58.224 --> 56:00.313
You'’re talking about
British people?

56:00.357 --> 56:02.446
Traitors.

56:02.489 --> 56:04.361
Criminals and deviants.

56:04.404 --> 56:07.364
You bring me Thomas Wayne
to prove your commitment,

56:07.407 --> 56:08.843
Esme'’s released, scot-free.

56:12.020 --> 56:14.371
I'’ll bring you Wayne,

56:14.414 --> 56:17.765
and I'’ll join your society,

56:17.809 --> 56:19.419
but you let Esme go first.

56:19.463 --> 56:21.508
And lose my only
bargaining chip?

56:21.552 --> 56:23.858
I don'’t think so.
Well,

56:23.902 --> 56:26.165
what'’s to stop you topping us
all as soon as you have Wayne?

56:26.208 --> 56:27.819
What have I just
been saying to you?

56:27.862 --> 56:29.560
You are far too
important a person

56:29.603 --> 56:32.345
to be topped
willy-nilly.

56:32.389 --> 56:35.304
I need you.
Your country needs you.

56:37.002 --> 56:39.700
Make the call,
Alfred.

56:39.744 --> 56:43.922
When your friends bring back
Wayne, Esme will be released.

56:45.358 --> 56:46.881
Call them.

56:49.014 --> 56:50.363
Call them.

56:54.280 --> 56:55.455
Damn it.

56:55.499 --> 56:56.761
Wait.

56:56.804 --> 56:58.197
I'’ll get out here.

56:58.240 --> 57:03.028
Uh, Davey, you heard him,
there'’s no going in after.

57:03.071 --> 57:07.467
I'’m not deaf, am I?
It'’s your awful driving, Bazza,

57:07.511 --> 57:10.644
makes me sick.
I'’d sooner walk.

57:10.688 --> 57:12.385
It'’s a long way home, Daveboy.

57:12.429 --> 57:15.388
Uh, well, you know me,
always up for a good tab.

57:21.438 --> 57:23.352
Jesus.

57:23.396 --> 57:26.791
If shite occurs,

57:26.834 --> 57:29.010
and you'’re playing
"Lili Marlene" for me,

57:29.054 --> 57:31.752
make mine an Islay single malt.

57:37.497 --> 57:39.020
Not too peaty.

57:41.370 --> 57:43.285
What is he doing?

57:43.329 --> 57:45.897
Being Celtic.

57:48.334 --> 57:50.554
I'’m waiting, Alfred.

57:56.690 --> 57:58.039
Lovely color, this brandy.

58:07.527 --> 58:12.489
Now, I don'’t like
doing violence...

58:12.532 --> 58:13.881
and I don'’t like you, mate.

58:13.925 --> 58:17.624
I strongly suspect that
you'’re gonna tuck us up.

58:17.668 --> 58:20.453
In fact, I know you will.

58:20.497 --> 58:23.238
It'’s a shame.

58:23.282 --> 58:24.849
Your trust I
could'’ve earned,

58:24.892 --> 58:29.549
but a squeamish soldier
is not something I can use.

58:29.593 --> 58:31.551
Pity.

58:31.595 --> 58:33.335
You'’re a good man,

58:33.379 --> 58:35.337
and Esme deserves
none of this.

58:45.086 --> 58:47.088
Hi. Uh, good evening, gentlemen.

59:01.102 --> 59:02.190
Give me a damage report.

59:02.234 --> 59:05.367
DAVEBOY:
Alfie!

59:05.411 --> 59:08.196
It'’s me! Daveboy!

59:08.240 --> 59:10.634
Saving your sassenach arse
again!

59:11.460 --> 59:13.419
Ah! You pig!

59:13.462 --> 59:16.248
HARWOOD:
Sorry about
your friends,

59:16.291 --> 59:18.511
but it'’s a war
and there will be bloodshed.

59:20.252 --> 59:22.036
Yeah.

59:24.822 --> 59:26.954
That'’s true.

59:32.481 --> 59:34.005
Drop it.

59:35.746 --> 59:37.312
Where are the keys?

59:41.926 --> 59:43.057
Thanks.

59:47.671 --> 59:48.976
Think about what
you'’re doing, Alfred.

1:00:01.772 --> 1:00:03.556
Davey.

1:00:03.600 --> 1:00:04.731
Where'’s the yank,

1:00:04.775 --> 1:00:06.603
you daft bastard?He'’s safe.

1:00:06.646 --> 1:00:07.952
Don'’t worry.

1:00:10.041 --> 1:00:11.564
You shot a granny?

1:00:26.013 --> 1:00:27.014
Alfred!

1:00:41.594 --> 1:00:43.204
Turn away.

1:00:51.560 --> 1:00:54.085
Esme.

1:00:54.128 --> 1:00:56.391
You all right?

1:00:56.435 --> 1:01:00.265
No. I want
to go home.

1:01:26.987 --> 1:01:28.946
Good morning, madam.

1:01:28.989 --> 1:01:30.730
Gentlemen.

1:01:30.774 --> 1:01:34.647
Detective Inspector Aziz,
Scotland Yard.

1:01:34.691 --> 1:01:36.693
Come with me.

1:01:36.736 --> 1:01:38.216
It'’s all right.

1:01:43.308 --> 1:01:45.440
Spot of bother?

1:02:16.645 --> 1:02:17.734
Hello again.

1:02:21.346 --> 1:02:22.913
Hello.

1:02:22.956 --> 1:02:24.262
Where'’s Esme, then?

1:02:24.305 --> 1:02:25.872
I don'’t know.

1:02:25.916 --> 1:02:27.961
Get away,
you just rescued her.

1:02:28.005 --> 1:02:29.180
Where is she?

1:02:29.223 --> 1:02:31.182
She left me.Oh.

1:02:31.225 --> 1:02:34.576
There'’s gratitude, eh?
Little minx.

1:02:35.708 --> 1:02:38.015
Now I'’m sorry, miss,

1:02:38.058 --> 1:02:40.669
I don'’t know your name.

1:02:40.713 --> 1:02:43.977
Whatever it is that you want,
I will try and sort it out,

1:02:44.021 --> 1:02:46.501
but you don'’t need to bring
my mum and dad into it.

1:02:46.545 --> 1:02:50.201
No. I don'’t.

1:02:50.244 --> 1:02:52.725
But that'’s just me.

1:02:52.769 --> 1:02:54.727
Vindictive.

1:02:54.771 --> 1:02:55.946
MR. PENNYWORTH:
Bloody deviant.

1:02:55.989 --> 1:02:57.817
Don'’t talk
to her, Alfred.

1:02:57.861 --> 1:03:00.559
Now then, be nice,
and mind you don'’t keep

1:03:00.602 --> 1:03:02.517
creeping towards me
like that,

1:03:02.561 --> 1:03:04.693
or I'’ll have your mum's guts
all over this nice settee.

1:03:04.737 --> 1:03:06.478
I like your mum.

1:03:06.521 --> 1:03:09.437
She'’s got gumption.
Haven'’t you?

1:03:09.481 --> 1:03:10.830
You'’re not well, love.

1:03:10.874 --> 1:03:13.311
You need doctors.

1:03:13.354 --> 1:03:14.921
Cheek.

1:03:14.965 --> 1:03:17.968
I'’m fit as a fiddle, me.

1:03:18.011 --> 1:03:20.144
It'’s you looks a bit peaky.

1:03:20.187 --> 1:03:22.276
Where'’s Esme?

1:03:22.320 --> 1:03:24.931
Honestly, I don'’t know.
I wish I did.

1:03:26.367 --> 1:03:29.153
Tell them to go away.

1:03:29.196 --> 1:03:31.372
Go away!

1:03:31.416 --> 1:03:32.809
ESME:
Alfie, it'’s me.

1:03:32.852 --> 1:03:35.246
Hmm.
Alfie?

1:03:35.289 --> 1:03:37.683
We need to talk.

1:03:37.726 --> 1:03:40.642
Anyone opens their gob,
shoot Mum.

1:03:40.686 --> 1:03:44.864
Alfie, please just come
and talk to me.

1:03:44.908 --> 1:03:45.865
Alfie?

1:03:49.695 --> 1:03:50.827
Alfie?

1:03:52.002 --> 1:03:53.655
Hello, pet.

1:03:56.136 --> 1:03:59.270
You can stop worrying.
There she is.

1:03:59.313 --> 1:04:02.621
Oh, I thought
you'’d left him.

1:04:02.664 --> 1:04:04.231
I told her.
I said,

1:04:04.275 --> 1:04:06.103
"That lad thinks you'’ve got
gold knickers on."

1:04:06.146 --> 1:04:08.018
Put that gun
in his ear.

1:04:08.061 --> 1:04:09.976
Yeah, it'’s okay, it's okay.

1:04:10.020 --> 1:04:11.891
Last time I saw
this lass,

1:04:11.935 --> 1:04:14.546
she made me look a right clown.
Didn'’t you, eh?

1:04:14.589 --> 1:04:17.854
Why? Why?

1:04:17.897 --> 1:04:19.856
I was nice to you, wasn'’t I?

1:04:19.899 --> 1:04:22.075
I could'’ve done all sorts,
but I didn'’t,

1:04:22.119 --> 1:04:25.078
did I?
I apologize.

1:04:25.122 --> 1:04:27.167
Apology not accepted.

1:04:27.211 --> 1:04:29.604
I hate snobby cows like you.

1:04:29.648 --> 1:04:31.215
All the same.

1:04:31.258 --> 1:04:33.913
Show a bit of kindness,
and they treat you like dirt.

1:04:33.957 --> 1:04:36.481
Miss, can I ask
you something?

1:04:36.524 --> 1:04:37.874
Shut it, you!

1:04:39.440 --> 1:04:41.529
I'’m not dirt, Esme.

1:04:41.573 --> 1:04:44.010
I'’m a human being like you.

1:04:44.054 --> 1:04:46.404
I'’ve got feelings.

1:04:46.447 --> 1:04:48.014
I see that now.

1:04:48.058 --> 1:04:51.104
Oh, so she
sees it now.

1:04:51.148 --> 1:04:52.889
So you admit you thought
I was dirt before.

1:04:52.932 --> 1:04:55.717
No. No, I never
thought that.

1:04:55.761 --> 1:04:58.459
You little liar.

1:05:01.114 --> 1:05:04.204
Please don'’t do that.Or else what?

1:05:24.398 --> 1:05:26.574
Mind that, love.

1:05:44.027 --> 1:05:45.158
PRIME MINISTER:
Come.

1:05:47.726 --> 1:05:50.859
Prime Minister, the American
ambassador'’s on the phone.

1:05:50.903 --> 1:05:52.818
Thank you, Roger.

1:06:01.522 --> 1:06:04.308
Hank, how splendid
to hear from you.

1:06:08.355 --> 1:06:10.705
Oh, thank you so much, Hank.

1:06:10.749 --> 1:06:12.881
It'’s most kind of you
to cry cavey.

1:06:12.925 --> 1:06:16.146
We know all about that
little situation,

1:06:16.189 --> 1:06:19.323
and we'’ve taken care of it.

1:06:19.366 --> 1:06:20.846
Yes.

1:06:20.889 --> 1:06:23.631
A storm in a teacup. Mm.

1:06:25.720 --> 1:06:29.072
Well, a few disgruntled
civil servants

1:06:29.115 --> 1:06:30.812
will lose their pensions,
no doubt.

1:06:30.856 --> 1:06:33.990
But otherwise, no harm, no foul.

1:06:34.033 --> 1:06:36.775
Cheerio.

1:06:49.527 --> 1:06:52.182
Dear me, James.

1:06:52.225 --> 1:06:55.359
Here'’s a pickle, eh?

1:07:01.365 --> 1:07:03.802
How are we going
to keep this quiet?

1:07:10.287 --> 1:07:11.940
THOMAS: I'’ve been promoted
to a permanent posting.

1:07:11.984 --> 1:07:16.771
If I have any security needs,

1:07:16.815 --> 1:07:18.730
I thought perhaps
you and I could come

1:07:18.773 --> 1:07:19.905
to some kind of arrangement.

1:07:21.037 --> 1:07:24.083
An annual contract
perhaps.

1:07:24.127 --> 1:07:26.303
Well, that'’s very
amiable of you.

1:07:26.346 --> 1:07:28.218
I thought you'’d resent me,
abducting you and that.

1:07:28.261 --> 1:07:30.394
No. No hard feelings.

1:07:30.437 --> 1:07:32.439
Just the highest respect
for your competence.

1:07:34.050 --> 1:07:35.921
Your business jolly near
got us killed.

1:07:35.964 --> 1:07:38.880
ALFRED:
She'’s not wrong.

1:07:38.924 --> 1:07:40.447
What is your
business exactly?

1:07:40.491 --> 1:07:42.319
The company I work for
works for the government

1:07:42.362 --> 1:07:44.669
of the United States of America,
under the strictest

1:07:44.712 --> 1:07:48.977
standards of honor
and justice.

1:07:49.021 --> 1:07:52.068
Ah. You'’re a hat job.

1:07:52.111 --> 1:07:54.113
Pardon?

1:07:54.157 --> 1:07:56.202
A spook.

1:07:56.246 --> 1:07:58.378
A foreign intelligence officer.
CIA?

1:08:01.599 --> 1:08:05.124
Well, I can assure you,
I am nothing of the sort.

1:08:05.168 --> 1:08:06.386
Swear on your mum.

1:08:06.430 --> 1:08:09.737
My mother is not germane here.
I am not

1:08:09.781 --> 1:08:12.262
a hat job.

1:08:16.309 --> 1:08:17.919
Right.

1:08:20.008 --> 1:08:22.663
Well, I can see
your mind is made up.

1:08:22.707 --> 1:08:24.665
I shan'’t keep you.

1:08:24.709 --> 1:08:26.624
Though, I must tell you,

1:08:26.667 --> 1:08:30.062
I'’m not easily discouraged.
I will be back.

1:08:30.106 --> 1:08:32.108
ESME: Thank you for your
warning, Mr. Wayne.

1:08:32.151 --> 1:08:33.848
But Alfie doesn'’t need a job.

1:08:33.892 --> 1:08:35.241
He'’ll have plenty
of business opportunities

1:08:35.285 --> 1:08:36.460
once he gets his medal.

1:08:36.503 --> 1:08:38.984
He'’s going to be
a national hero.

1:08:39.027 --> 1:08:41.117
I'’ll see you out,

1:08:41.160 --> 1:08:42.814
shall I?

1:09:10.972 --> 1:09:12.887
I won'’t bite.

1:09:39.740 --> 1:09:41.438
I'’m very grateful
to you, Alfred.

1:09:43.004 --> 1:09:45.616
Deeply grateful.

1:09:47.748 --> 1:09:48.923
Promise me one thing.

1:09:50.838 --> 1:09:53.232
Of course,
Your Majesty.

1:09:53.276 --> 1:09:54.407
Anything.

1:09:54.451 --> 1:09:56.583
Promise me
your silence.

1:09:56.627 --> 1:10:00.848
Were it known, this terrible
episode would shake the nation.

1:10:00.892 --> 1:10:03.242
You must never tell a soul
what you did for your country.

1:10:03.286 --> 1:10:06.637
Never, ma'’am.

1:10:06.680 --> 1:10:09.292
Not a soul.
I promise.

1:10:09.335 --> 1:10:11.250
My dear,

1:10:11.294 --> 1:10:12.904
loyal friend,

1:10:12.947 --> 1:10:16.342
I fear dark times
lay ahead,

1:10:16.386 --> 1:10:19.215
and loyalties
will be tested.

1:10:26.526 --> 1:10:29.921
I'’ll be back! I'll be back!

1:10:29.964 --> 1:10:32.880
