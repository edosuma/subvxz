Ah...

01:13.000 --> 01:14.350
Ah...ah...

01:14.383 --> 01:16.433
Ahchoo!

01:17.166 --> 01:20.000
Whoa. Totally
sorry, dude.

01:20.033 --> 01:23.066
Like, it's no problem,
really.

01:23.100 --> 01:26.133
[Whimpering]

01:37.133 --> 01:38.166
[Bell dings]

01:38.200 --> 01:40.033
Ha ha ha ha!

01:40.066 --> 01:42.250
What's up, dude?
Ha ha ha!

01:42.283 --> 01:43.466
Can I help you?

01:44.000 --> 01:46.133
Uh, right.

01:46.166 --> 01:49.483
Uh...uh...

01:50.016 --> 01:50.483
Uh...

01:51.016 --> 01:53.016
You must be here
for the test study.

01:53.050 --> 01:56.350
Yeah, right.
Ha ha ha! Right.

01:56.383 --> 02:00.483
Sign in
on the clipboard,
and we'll call you.

02:02.200 --> 02:06.350
Yo, dude, do we get paid,
you know, in advance?

02:06.383 --> 02:08.350
Why don't you
take a seat,

02:08.383 --> 02:11.333
and we'll
call you, dude.

02:11.366 --> 02:13.050
Yeah. Ha ha!

02:13.083 --> 02:17.033
Right, dude.
Ha ha ha!

02:27.150 --> 02:29.383
[Sniffing]

02:45.016 --> 02:47.183
[Smacking and gulping]

02:47.216 --> 02:49.266
Mmm!

02:52.450 --> 02:54.216
Ha ha!

02:56.400 --> 03:01.050
Ugh! Puke-a-rama!

03:01.416 --> 03:04.116
Number 11,
number 11.

03:04.150 --> 03:07.100
The doctor will
see you now.

03:08.083 --> 03:10.350
Phew!

03:14.016 --> 03:15.250
Eww.

03:15.283 --> 03:17.166
Well, now, let's see.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.016
Do you know
why you're here?

03:19.050 --> 03:22.183
Well, it's because, like,
because, like,

03:22.216 --> 03:26.450
because, like,
I'm a total germophobe.

03:26.483 --> 03:28.216
[Sobbing]

03:28.250 --> 03:32.000
Now, now. Admitting
that you have a fear
of germs

03:32.033 --> 03:35.216
is the first step
to recovery.

03:35.250 --> 03:39.366
Now, you realize
that this study
is quite radical.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.116
Oh, totally radical.

03:41.150 --> 03:44.016
Then you're positive
you want to go
through with it?

03:44.050 --> 03:46.000
Totally. I'm so sure.

03:46.033 --> 03:47.083
Very well.

03:47.116 --> 03:49.300
Nurse, would you
please let in
subject "b"

03:49.333 --> 03:52.250
for test case
study number 11?

03:52.283 --> 03:54.216
Nurse: Right away,
doctor.

03:54.250 --> 03:57.200
Hey, where's the party?

03:57.233 --> 03:58.216
What's that?

03:58.250 --> 04:00.150
That is your
test partner.

04:00.183 --> 04:01.333
For the next
two weeks,

04:01.366 --> 04:05.050
you must interact
with your partner
on a daily basis.

04:05.083 --> 04:07.000
Can you do that?

04:14.050 --> 04:15.000
With that? No way.

04:15.033 --> 04:16.250
Can't do it.
Totally can't. Uh-uh.

04:16.283 --> 04:20.150
Doctor: You must,
if you ever hope to be
even partially cured.

04:20.183 --> 04:25.200
No. Like, no, like, no,
like, no, like, no!

05:12.483 --> 05:17.333
I'm sorry, I can't.
I just can't.

05:20.116 --> 05:22.350
How do you
expect to get
over your problem

05:22.383 --> 05:26.166
if you can't
get past even
the first steps?

05:26.200 --> 05:29.233
Well, doc,
it's, like, like...

05:29.266 --> 05:32.066
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're just so
totally gnarly.

05:32.100 --> 05:35.350
I can't help it.
You-you're dirty
and greasy,

05:35.383 --> 05:38.233
and you totally gag me
with a spoon.

05:38.266 --> 05:39.483
Uh, you're really nice.

05:40.016 --> 05:43.316
I think you're awesome,
but you're just grody
to the Max.

05:43.350 --> 05:46.350
I'm sorry, doctor.
This test case just
isn't gonna work.

05:46.383 --> 05:48.200
I'm so sorry!

05:48.233 --> 05:51.133
I'll be seeing
you around, ok?

05:54.166 --> 05:56.283
Like, coming!

05:56.316 --> 05:58.200
[Gasp]

06:01.166 --> 06:03.366
It's you.
What are you doing here?

06:03.400 --> 06:04.450
Well,
it's like this.

06:04.483 --> 06:08.350
See, um, I was
thinking about
your problem.

06:08.383 --> 06:10.033
It's totally bogus.

06:10.066 --> 06:11.450
That clinic
is bad news.

06:11.483 --> 06:14.233
What you need is
a real situation.

06:14.266 --> 06:16.383
No white lab coats,
no tests,

06:16.416 --> 06:19.100
no experiments.

06:19.133 --> 06:22.000
So I was thinking...

06:22.033 --> 06:24.216
I was hoping
you'd come with me

06:24.250 --> 06:26.366
to the annual
new year's
dance-a-thon.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.050
The last couple
to remain dancing
this year

06:29.083 --> 06:30.000
wins 8 months'
supply

06:30.033 --> 06:31.133
of cheeks-so-soft
toilet paper

06:31.166 --> 06:33.250
or 200 rolls--
whichever
comes first.

06:33.283 --> 06:35.216
And a $500
gift certificate

06:35.250 --> 06:36.400
to happy pappy's
totally awesome

06:36.433 --> 06:38.466
chicken and seafood
house in the valley.

06:39.000 --> 06:39.466
What do you say?

06:40.000 --> 06:43.066
You did this,
like, all for me?

06:48.050 --> 06:51.116
Like, I'd love to,
totally.

06:51.150 --> 06:53.433
[Both laughing]

06:57.333 --> 06:59.016
Hey, dudes and dudettes!

06:59.050 --> 07:03.416
Welcome to the totally killer
annual new year's
dance-a-thon!

07:03.450 --> 07:06.266
Now, I know you're
all majorly excited

07:06.300 --> 07:08.050
to dance until the new year.

07:08.083 --> 07:10.450
And don't forget--
last couple standing

07:10.483 --> 07:14.100
wins the whole
awesome shebang!

07:14.133 --> 07:16.433
Ok, kids, get ready!

07:16.466 --> 07:17.433
Good luck.

07:17.466 --> 07:19.333
You, too.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.150
Are you having
a tubular time?

07:47.183 --> 07:51.416
Oh, I think this is
the most tubular time
I've ever had.

07:51.450 --> 07:54.100
That's right!

08:04.383 --> 08:07.400
Look, they're
the last ones
besides us.

08:07.433 --> 08:10.233
We might actually,
like, win?

08:10.266 --> 08:11.416
Hey, dudes and dudettes!

08:11.450 --> 08:14.016
It's just a few minutes
till midnight!

08:14.050 --> 08:16.300
So let's bring the music
down just a bit.

08:16.333 --> 08:22.000
But don't stop dancing,
or you're totally bumming!

08:22.333 --> 08:26.183
Oh, no! We have to,
like, slow dance!

08:26.216 --> 08:28.133
Like, so?

08:28.166 --> 08:31.433
Oh, we have to, like, touch.

08:31.466 --> 08:33.016
Emcee:
Hurry up, couples!

08:33.050 --> 08:36.233
Start dancing,
or you will be so disqualified!

08:36.266 --> 08:39.250
Oh, no. What are
we gonna do?
We're gonna lose.

08:39.283 --> 08:42.466
Oh, what a total bummer!
We won't win!

08:43.000 --> 08:43.483
What are those?

08:44.016 --> 08:47.450
I thought these
might come in handy.

08:52.316 --> 08:55.350
Crowd: 10, 9, 8...

08:55.383 --> 08:57.250
Oh, we've won!

08:57.283 --> 09:00.233
In, like,
more ways than one.

09:00.266 --> 09:06.166
Crowd: 3, 2, 1!
Happy new year!

09:08.116 --> 09:13.266
See? Remember? That's why.
Now, give 'em back!

09:34.416 --> 09:37.200
[Clock ticking]

10:12.100 --> 10:16.400
How about taking
your turn...Today?!

10:16.433 --> 10:21.133
Mmm...oh!

10:26.216 --> 10:27.466
Upper!

10:28.000 --> 10:31.050
That's 24 points!

10:32.333 --> 10:34.183
Roughly.

10:34.216 --> 10:36.300
Both: I scream!

10:36.333 --> 10:37.233
You scream!

10:37.266 --> 10:39.450
We all scream
for ice cream!

10:39.483 --> 10:42.266
Mom: Hey,
are you cheating?

10:42.300 --> 10:46.266
Dad: Now, what on earth
would make you think that?

10:55.050 --> 10:56.350
Then what's
this letter

10:56.383 --> 10:59.100
I found hidden
in your pocket?

10:59.133 --> 11:00.100
Cheating?

11:00.133 --> 11:01.166
A letter?

11:01.200 --> 11:04.383
Well, explain
yourself this time!

11:04.416 --> 11:09.383
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

11:09.416 --> 11:13.300
What?
I don't believe you!

11:13.333 --> 11:16.200
Passion? Passion?!

11:16.233 --> 11:18.416
This is what
that letter
was all about,

11:18.450 --> 11:21.316
just so you can have
passion?

11:21.350 --> 11:23.033
Well, call it
whatever you want.

11:23.066 --> 11:26.100
All this means is that
I'm gonna be the winner
in the end,

11:26.133 --> 11:28.450
and you're gonna be left
high and dry.

11:28.483 --> 11:31.200
Dexter, what are
we gonna do?

11:31.233 --> 11:33.466
It's none of
our business.

11:35.433 --> 11:38.166
Ha! I'm not losing out
on this one.

11:38.200 --> 11:39.200
You're the cheater here.

11:39.233 --> 11:41.266
Well, if that's how
you like to play

11:41.300 --> 11:43.433
your little games,
then fine.

11:43.466 --> 11:45.200
We're through.

11:45.233 --> 11:46.266
[Tiles rattling]

11:46.300 --> 11:47.366
What are you doing?

11:47.400 --> 11:49.050
I'm packing it up.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.283
Like I said, if
that's how you like
to play the game,

11:51.316 --> 11:53.466
then you're
going to have to
play it alone.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.100
I'm leaving.

11:55.133 --> 11:56.233
Oh, yeah?

11:56.266 --> 11:59.016
Well, how about the last time
I caught you cheating?

11:59.050 --> 12:03.483
How easily you seem to forget
who dealt the cards then.

12:04.016 --> 12:05.083
That was different.

12:05.116 --> 12:08.433
I told you that
the Jack of spades
was wild.

12:08.466 --> 12:10.066
Who is Jack?

12:10.100 --> 12:14.066
Whoever he is,
he must be more
exciting than dad.

12:17.350 --> 12:21.200
Hey, what are you
trying to do--kill me
with that thing?

12:21.233 --> 12:23.116
Mom, don't do it!

12:23.150 --> 12:24.283
Mom, stop!

12:24.316 --> 12:25.183
No, mom!

12:25.216 --> 12:27.016
We can work this out!

12:27.050 --> 12:28.000
Don't do it!

12:28.033 --> 12:29.033
Do not do it!

12:29.066 --> 12:31.166
We can work this...

12:31.200 --> 12:32.233
Out?

12:32.266 --> 12:35.266
Oh, kids,
of course we can
work this out.

12:35.300 --> 12:41.250
Sometimes we just let
our competitive nature
get the best of us.

12:42.216 --> 12:45.000
Besides, it's just
a game, right?

12:45.033 --> 12:48.066
Both:
Heh, heh, heh. Right.

13:07.250 --> 13:10.433
Man: Die, die, die!

13:10.466 --> 13:12.483
Die, stinky germs!

13:13.016 --> 13:16.316
Naval hygiene is
crucial to the defense
of our great country.

13:16.350 --> 13:18.133
Isn't that right,
soldier?

13:18.166 --> 13:20.250
Sir, yes, sir!

13:24.250 --> 13:25.400
Computer, report.

13:25.433 --> 13:27.116
Computer: Good morning,
general admission.

13:27.150 --> 13:30.100
My sensors are reading
a loss of power in all
sectors, sir.

13:30.133 --> 13:32.483
Our satellites indicate
an unidentified force
on earth

13:33.016 --> 13:35.116
that seems to be
draining all of
our power, sir.

13:35.150 --> 13:40.000
Unidentified force on
earth?
Obviously it's aliens.

13:40.033 --> 13:42.250
Sir, yes, sir,
obviously, sir!

13:42.283 --> 13:43.233
Indeed.

13:43.266 --> 13:44.433
Using a ground base
here on earth,

13:44.466 --> 13:49.083
these stinky, filthy aliens
have hatched an evil plan

13:49.116 --> 13:51.466
to contaminate the military
with filthy germs

13:52.000 --> 13:55.133
so they can take over
the world, right?

13:55.166 --> 13:57.200
Sir, yes, sir!
Right!

13:57.233 --> 13:58.266
Computer.

13:58.300 --> 13:59.233
Yes, sir.

13:59.266 --> 14:00.233
Commence operation.

14:00.266 --> 14:03.400
Destroy the evil,
stinky aliens.

14:03.433 --> 14:06.200
[Alarm buzzing]

14:37.333 --> 14:39.183
General: Well, whoever
or whatever it is

14:39.216 --> 14:45.050
that's sucking up our power
is in for a big surprise.

14:49.183 --> 14:50.250
Excellent.

14:50.283 --> 14:54.033
We have full power
and optimum regulating charge.

14:54.066 --> 14:55.200
Microwaves are a go. Check.

14:55.233 --> 14:58.033
Temperature is just right,
fluids all check.

14:58.066 --> 15:00.283
Binary code and teleports
are all functioning.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.383
Rolling bowling ball
rolling, check.

15:02.416 --> 15:04.316
Spinning sprinkler
spinning, check.

15:04.350 --> 15:08.200
All systems are go
for 530 nanometers
of high-yielding

anti-cholesteric brain

15:13.150 --> 15:15.466
makes me smart
and beautiful.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.216
[Sniffs]

15:17.250 --> 15:19.316
Smells a bit stinky.

15:19.350 --> 15:22.066
Maybe it needs
more salt.

15:24.116 --> 15:25.233
What the--

15:25.266 --> 15:28.350
Dexter, your room is stinky.
You'd better clean it up,

15:28.383 --> 15:31.216
or else we'll have to put
you up for adoption.

15:31.250 --> 15:32.300
[Sniffing] Hmm.

15:32.333 --> 15:35.383
I guess I have been neglecting
the lab lately.

15:35.416 --> 15:37.483
[Croaking
like frog]

15:40.416 --> 15:45.400
Computer: Warning,
warning, warning...

15:49.333 --> 15:52.450
Computer, what is it?
What is intruding?

15:52.483 --> 15:53.483
Good morning, Dexter.

15:54.016 --> 15:56.200
My radar is picking up
faint readings

15:56.233 --> 15:59.283
of an incoming
unidentified fighting force.

15:59.316 --> 16:01.416
Who--who is it?

16:01.450 --> 16:03.066
Um, hello!

16:03.100 --> 16:06.233
Unidentified,
as in I don't know.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.166
I'd better have
a closer listen

16:08.200 --> 16:11.266
with my supersensitive
headphones.

16:13.066 --> 16:15.333
[Static]

16:18.283 --> 16:20.166
Attention, men.
This is your general.

16:20.200 --> 16:25.383
We are about to encounter
the evil, filthy aliens'
ground base.

16:25.416 --> 16:26.483
I repeat,

16:27.016 --> 16:32.283
[static] We are--
the evil, filthy aliens' gr--

16:32.316 --> 16:35.350
oh, no. The evil,
filthy aliens' gr!

16:35.383 --> 16:39.150
They're coming!
They're coming!

16:45.283 --> 16:50.233
Aah! My eyes. My eyes!
They burn!

16:50.266 --> 16:53.100
[Aircraft approaching]

17:04.233 --> 17:07.416
[Boat whistle blowing]

17:09.366 --> 17:12.116
Man: We're going in.

17:13.083 --> 17:15.133
The chickens are
in the soup.

17:15.166 --> 17:16.083
Dexter: Oh, no!

17:16.116 --> 17:17.400
Boy, this place
stinks.

17:17.433 --> 17:20.350
Ugh. I can smell it
through my mask.

17:20.383 --> 17:21.466
Somebody light a match!

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
General: Hold your ground, men.
Filthy, stinking--

17:25.033 --> 17:28.216
they are here--
the evil, filthy
aliens' gr!

17:28.250 --> 17:32.150
Oh, no! That alien
is heading toward
my freezer,

17:32.183 --> 17:36.383
where I keep my rare
biologically-engineered
Jurassic eggs.

17:36.416 --> 17:39.250
Looks like we found
the aliens' nest, sir.

17:39.283 --> 17:40.150
Aah!

17:40.183 --> 17:42.283
Aah! Aah!
Germs! Germs!

17:42.316 --> 17:45.333
Get 'em off!
Get 'em off!

17:47.316 --> 17:49.133
Nooooo!

17:50.050 --> 17:54.283
No filthy alien
is going to
blow up my eggs!

17:55.400 --> 17:57.166
Incoming!

17:57.200 --> 17:58.283
Ohh!

17:58.316 --> 18:01.133
Hee-ya!

18:06.050 --> 18:07.366
Surrounded.

18:21.350 --> 18:24.366
Aah! It stinks! Aah!

18:24.400 --> 18:29.416
It seems that the aliens
have an aversion to stinky.

18:29.450 --> 18:31.316
[Gasps]

18:33.183 --> 18:35.050
That's it.

18:54.250 --> 18:56.250
Let's rock!

18:57.116 --> 19:01.333
Smell ya later,
filthy, evil aliens' gr.

19:07.450 --> 19:10.050
Aah! Oh,
that smells!

19:10.083 --> 19:11.450
It smells!

19:16.083 --> 19:17.450
Ohhh!
Ohhh!

19:19.266 --> 19:22.116
Aah! My nose!
It burns!

19:22.150 --> 19:24.233
[Troops screaming]

19:28.316 --> 19:34.000
General, we're under
severe stink attack.
We've got to pull out!

19:39.116 --> 19:41.400
[Troops moaning]

19:49.233 --> 19:51.483
Looks like I've
defeated them all.

19:52.016 --> 19:53.433
General: Not quite!

19:55.200 --> 19:56.450
You filthy alien!

19:56.483 --> 19:58.250
Filthy?

20:00.366 --> 20:01.466
What the--

20:02.016 --> 20:04.066
you're not
a filthy alien.

20:04.100 --> 20:05.233
You're just
a little boy.

20:05.266 --> 20:10.066
Yes, and you are
just a grown man,
a grown general,

20:10.100 --> 20:13.450
whose whole army
was defeated by
this here little boy.

20:13.483 --> 20:16.050
Blast it! You've got
a point there.

20:16.083 --> 20:20.083
If word gets out that
the Navy was defeated
by a little boy,

20:20.116 --> 20:23.066
we'll be
the laughingstock
of the world.

20:23.100 --> 20:24.100
Yes, you will.

20:24.133 --> 20:26.333
Listen, kid, can you
keep this a secret?

20:26.366 --> 20:28.433
Well, on two conditions.

20:28.466 --> 20:30.100
And they would be?

20:30.133 --> 20:34.100
You guys have got to
keep my laboratory
a secret, ok?

20:34.133 --> 20:36.266
What laboratory?

20:36.300 --> 20:39.366
Yes, indeed.
What laboratory?

20:39.400 --> 20:41.433
[Both laughing]

20:41.466 --> 20:43.350
And the second
condition?

20:43.383 --> 20:46.133
Well, this place
is a mess,

20:46.166 --> 20:50.333
and I need it
not to be a mess,
if you know what I mean.

20:50.366 --> 20:53.433
I hear you
loud and clear.

21:01.166 --> 21:03.283
Excellent job, general!

21:05.066 --> 21:06.333
This place is spotless.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.350
You're darn
tooting, kid.

21:08.383 --> 21:12.333
Well, kid,
it's been swell.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.466
General:
All right, men, listen up!

21:15.000 --> 21:19.316
Let's return to the main base
for a nice, hot bath.

21:19.350 --> 21:23.200
[Troops talking at once]

21:28.200 --> 21:32.216
Dexter, I hope
that you remembered
to clean your room.

21:32.250 --> 21:36.466
Oh, yeah, dad.
I cleaned house.

21:42.033 --> 21:43.383
Enter at your own peril
past the vaulted door

21:43.416 --> 21:45.000

21:46.016 --> 21:48.483
