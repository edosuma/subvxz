You don't remember?

00:30.615 --> 00:31.783
What is happening to me?

00:31.991 --> 00:34.077
Gonna need people I can trust
watching over this place.

00:34.244 --> 00:36.829
- You could be my deputy here in Haven.
- Thanks.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.210
You shouldn't have
come here, Oswald.

00:42.377 --> 00:43.878
Perhaps you shouldn't
have stolen my people.

01:57.410 --> 01:58.703
You! Hey, listen up.

01:59.370 --> 02:01.956
Pair up. I need teams going in
looking for survivors.

02:02.123 --> 02:04.167
- Go. Get those people back!
- (siren wailing)

02:04.334 --> 02:06.002
Hey. You.

02:06.169 --> 02:07.879

02:11.674 --> 02:13.468
Hey. Hey, come on. Snap to.

02:13.843 --> 02:15.845
Focus. There's gonna
be a lot of wounded.

02:16.262 --> 02:17.722
Look at me. Look at me.

02:18.056 --> 02:20.391
All right. Find all the medical
supplies you can. Go.

02:24.312 --> 02:26.147
You did this.
You brought the gangs here!

02:26.314 --> 02:28.107
No! I would never allow that.

02:28.274 --> 02:30.360
None of them had explosives,
that I know of.

We got nothing to put hoses on.

Use the drinking water. Do it.

02:37.575 --> 02:38.785
Hey.Hey!

02:38.951 --> 02:41.245
Get those hoses

03:05.103 --> 03:07.021
Harvey.
Flames are dying.

03:07.188 --> 03:08.606
We need more teams inside.

03:09.232 --> 03:10.817
- There have to be survivors.
- I know.

03:11.401 --> 03:14.862
It's just,

WALKER:
I'm so terribly sorry, Captain.

03:54.694 --> 03:56.779
Do you have any idea
who's responsible?

03:57.405 --> 03:59.615
There was an incursion
by several of the gangs.

03:59.782 --> 04:01.576
Any one of them
could've done it.

04:01.909 --> 04:04.036
Right now, it's impossible
to rule anyone out.

04:04.662 --> 04:06.497
I'm working on getting you help.

04:06.664 --> 04:08.499
You've been promising me help
for weeks.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.210
I have bodies lined up
in the streets.

04:11.878 --> 04:14.213
You have every right
to be upset, Captain.

04:14.380 --> 04:15.965
- But I'm doing everything I can...
- Yeah.

04:16.132 --> 04:17.300
...to make sure
that you and your...

04:17.466 --> 04:20.094

04:31.189 --> 04:32.356
Let them through.

04:33.107 --> 04:34.734
- There he is!
- Let them through!

04:34.942 --> 04:37.236
Let them through. It's okay.
It's all right.

04:37.445 --> 04:39.489
MAN: When are you gonna
find out who did this?

04:39.655 --> 04:40.948
My family was in there.

04:41.115 --> 04:42.700
How do we know we're safe here?

04:42.867 --> 04:43.910
GORDON:
I know...

04:45.661 --> 04:49.624
I know each one of you lost
someone you care for.

04:50.917 --> 04:52.376
I share your grief.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.295
I share your anger.

04:55.338 --> 04:56.672
But whoever destroyed
that building

04:56.839 --> 04:58.883
can't destroy
the hope we've built.

04:59.884 --> 05:01.636
Not unless we let them.

05:02.386 --> 05:03.471
I swear,

05:04.347 --> 05:08.059
I promise I won't stop
until I find those responsible.

05:09.894 --> 05:11.145
Justice will be done.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.648
How are you gonna stop it
from happening again?

05:13.815 --> 05:15.483
(crowd shouting)

05:24.116 --> 05:25.076
It was a nice try.

05:25.743 --> 05:26.994
Can you blame them?
They're angry.

05:27.370 --> 05:28.538
It's gonna take more than words.

05:28.871 --> 05:30.456
Someone has
to pay for this, soon.

05:30.623 --> 05:33.042
Well, the department's not
exactly firing on all cylinders.

05:33.209 --> 05:35.419
We got more men than bullets,
and we ain't got that many men.

05:35.586 --> 05:38.214
Lucius, I need something.
Comb through every piece

05:38.381 --> 05:39.382
of evidence you can find.

05:39.549 --> 05:40.800
I need to know who did this,
and how.

05:40.967 --> 05:42.844
It's not gonna be easy. The size
of the crime scene alone...

05:43.010 --> 05:44.887
Do whatever you have to do.
The clock is ticking.

05:45.721 --> 05:46.931
More than you know.

05:47.431 --> 05:50.184
When Barbara and I showed up,
that's when the building blew.

05:50.685 --> 05:52.103
She vanished right after.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.940
This doesn't make sense.
Not even for her.

05:56.107 --> 05:59.569
Nothing makes sense anymore.
You're in charge, Harvey.

06:02.321 --> 06:03.990
BRUCE:
Selina!

06:18.045 --> 06:18.838
Oh.

06:20.548 --> 06:21.382
Hey.

06:44.280 --> 06:45.740
I was afraid
you didn't get my signal.

06:46.616 --> 06:48.534
Lucius said the range
was only a couple miles.

06:48.868 --> 06:51.704
Oh, you know me, Master Bruce,
I managed to muddle through.

06:54.332 --> 06:56.959
So go on, then.
How did that happen?

06:58.794 --> 07:00.046
I let my guard down.

07:00.338 --> 07:01.672
You're telling me that
your captors shackle you,

07:01.839 --> 07:02.798
theyleave
a radio transponder

07:02.965 --> 07:05.760
in your pocket and...
and your weapons?

07:05.927 --> 07:06.719
Really?

07:07.845 --> 07:09.430
I think you're telling porkies.

07:10.806 --> 07:11.933
It was Selina.

07:12.475 --> 07:14.852
She's gone
after Jeremiah, alone.

07:15.895 --> 07:17.438
You want to follow her, do you?

07:18.522 --> 07:20.900
She's not herself, Alfred.
She's desperate for revenge.

07:21.192 --> 07:23.110
She's gonna get herself
hurt, or killed.

07:23.277 --> 07:25.071
Seems to be a little bit
of a recurring theme

07:25.279 --> 07:26.572
with madam, isn't it?

07:27.406 --> 07:28.991
You know, one of these days
you're gonna realize

07:29.158 --> 07:31.911
you can't save her from herself.

07:33.955 --> 07:35.289
Until that day comes...

07:39.210 --> 07:41.128
...I think we should go
and find her, don't you?

07:53.808 --> 07:54.976
(gun clicks)

07:57.311 --> 07:58.562
BARBARA:
Let him in.

08:00.898 --> 08:02.942
You're either here
for information,

08:04.235 --> 08:06.278
or you somehow think I might've
had something to do

08:06.445 --> 08:07.571
with that atrocity.

08:07.738 --> 08:09.365
Penguin murdered
Tabitha.

08:09.532 --> 08:10.866
You knew he was at Haven.

08:11.575 --> 08:12.785
You would've done anything
for revenge.

08:12.952 --> 08:14.370
And I could've killed him
then and there.

08:14.537 --> 08:15.621
So why didn't you?

08:17.790 --> 08:20.584
Because the person who blew up
Haven has to be stopped.

08:21.585 --> 08:23.087
That's all
that matters now.

08:23.963 --> 08:25.881
You're worried Sirens
could be next.

08:27.133 --> 08:28.759
I've been
putting out feelers.

08:30.219 --> 08:31.554
Is that what that was?

08:32.054 --> 08:33.764
He heard people
talking about a shady guy

08:33.931 --> 08:35.599
lurking around Haven
before it blew.

08:36.058 --> 08:36.851
This is Gotham.

08:37.018 --> 08:39.145
You're gonna have to do
better than "shady guy."

08:39.437 --> 08:40.730
How about a location?

08:41.480 --> 08:43.732
A building in the northeast
corner of Harlow Park.

08:44.025 --> 08:45.693
He says the guy's
holed up there.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.113
How much is this gonna cost me?

08:50.197 --> 08:51.323
Just do your job.

08:51.741 --> 08:53.159
Get the bastard.

08:59.874 --> 09:02.418
Did you really think I could've
murdered all those people?

09:04.754 --> 09:06.130
I don't know.

09:08.549 --> 09:10.176
I guess I deserve that.

09:11.594 --> 09:12.428
BULLOCK (over radio):
Jim.

09:13.679 --> 09:14.513
Jim.

09:16.098 --> 09:16.932
Jim, you read me?

09:17.183 --> 09:18.142
Yeah.

09:18.768 --> 09:19.977
We got a problem.

09:21.771 --> 09:22.980
On my Way-

09:32.364 --> 09:35.993
(door opens, closes)

09:38.871 --> 09:39.955
Oswald?

09:42.208 --> 09:43.542
What are you doing here?

09:44.001 --> 09:48.506
Jim, it has become
woefully apparent

09:48.672 --> 09:51.258
that you are outmanned,

09:51.425 --> 09:53.886
outgunned
and out of options.

09:56.013 --> 09:57.264
So I'm here to help.

10:00.726 --> 10:01.685
That's generous of you.

10:01.852 --> 10:03.646
Flaughsy
I'm just getting started.

10:10.027 --> 10:11.112
BULLOCK:
Well.

10:11.403 --> 10:13.989
Ain't you just Saint Nick
on a Christmas morning?

10:14.365 --> 10:16.700
Don't be shy. Go.
Take all you can carry.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.836
I'm guessing
there are strings attached?

10:27.795 --> 10:28.838
No strings.

10:29.088 --> 10:30.589
Save for the one
that we will cinch

10:30.756 --> 10:32.424
around the neck
of the Haven bomber.

10:33.092 --> 10:35.302
I lost people, too, Jim.

10:35.719 --> 10:39.473
People you lured with promises
of safety and security,

10:39.849 --> 10:41.350
only to have them incinerated.

10:41.517 --> 10:45.437
But let's just hold that
in abeyance for the moment.

10:46.021 --> 10:49.275
I would rather we put aside
our considerable differences,

10:50.192 --> 10:51.902
and go get the people
some justice.

10:54.446 --> 10:55.906
What do you say, partner?

11:08.127 --> 11:10.588
(sighs)

11:37.865 --> 11:38.991
Apparently,

11:39.909 --> 11:41.911
I've been on a trip,
or I'm going on one.

11:44.205 --> 11:46.081
I've also left myself a message.

11:46.749 --> 11:49.793
"In A-T number 1215 knows."

11:50.044 --> 11:51.962
In... nate?

11:52.296 --> 11:55.132
In... grate? inflate?

11:55.799 --> 11:57.009
In... mate?

11:57.509 --> 11:59.220
"Inmate number 1215 knows."

11:59.470 --> 12:00.971
Inmate number 1215 knows!

12:02.806 --> 12:04.516
Knows what?! (groans)

12:04.683 --> 12:06.685
Okay. Okay, think.

12:07.228 --> 12:09.146
Prison records.
Where do I get prison records?

12:09.772 --> 12:10.856
(sighs)

12:12.983 --> 12:13.817
Right.

12:19.990 --> 12:21.867
<i>IS'</i>

12:30.626 --> 12:31.377
To hell with Penguin.

12:31.543 --> 12:32.586
Haven wasn't your fault.

12:33.295 --> 12:34.755
I told the people it was safe.

12:34.922 --> 12:35.965
I made them into a target.

12:36.173 --> 12:37.007
Jim, you gave 'em...

12:37.174 --> 12:40.052
Don't tell me I gave
'em hope. They're dead.

12:41.387 --> 12:43.973
All right, fan out.

12:45.349 --> 12:47.893
We go building to building,
door to door.

12:48.477 --> 12:51.272
Our source said this is where
we'll find the bomber.

12:51.897 --> 12:53.357
He's here somewhere.

12:53.857 --> 12:56.277
Alvarez, take a squad, grab
the north side of the street.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.529
The rest of you,
cover the south.

12:59.238 --> 13:01.031
To the vile miscreant

13:01.198 --> 13:03.200
who murdered
those innocent Havenites,

13:03.659 --> 13:05.369
you have nowhere to run!

13:06.078 --> 13:07.579
There goes the element
of surprise.

13:07.871 --> 13:09.373
OSWALD:
We will root you out

13:09.540 --> 13:11.292

in one purpose!

13:15.254 --> 13:17.214
- Get back! Get back!

we found our guy, huh?

13:35.858 --> 13:36.817
We're sitting ducks out here.

13:36.984 --> 13:37.943
BULLOCK:
And one Penguin.

13:38.110 --> 13:39.445
Hey, Oswald, why don't you
crawl out there,

13:39.611 --> 13:41.739
grab that bullhorn and tell him
to come down quietly?

13:43.449 --> 13:44.408
(gunshon

13:45.659 --> 13:48.412
GORDON: Put your weapons down!
We have the building surrounded.

13:48.787 --> 13:50.622
And we have more ammo than you!

13:50.789 --> 13:52.833
Come out now
with your hands in the air.

13:54.293 --> 13:55.544
MAN:
Pretty cozy up here.

13:56.128 --> 13:57.212
Thanks,guys.

14:00.841 --> 14:02.092
I know that voice.

14:03.093 --> 14:04.178
<i>Zsasz'?</i>

14:05.095 --> 14:06.555
Oh, hey, guys. What's up?

14:07.056 --> 14:07.806
(gunshon

14:32.998 --> 14:34.875
(door creaks)

14:40.714 --> 14:41.673
Oh.

14:53.685 --> 14:55.062
It's impolite to
sneak up on people.

14:55.229 --> 14:56.522
So is breaking
and entering.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.358
Heard you were dead, Ed.

14:59.525 --> 15:00.818
Now what are you looking for?

15:01.318 --> 15:03.904
I am given,
and I am taken.

15:04.405 --> 15:06.031
I was there from
your first breath,

15:06.281 --> 15:09.243
and I will follow you
until your death.

15:10.035 --> 15:11.537
(exhales)
A name.

15:13.038 --> 15:14.081
So...

15:15.082 --> 15:18.043
you're looking for the name
of a prisoner at Blackgate.

15:19.878 --> 15:21.296
Call it a personal matter.

15:21.922 --> 15:24.007
- This folder's quite valuable.
- Right.

15:24.633 --> 15:26.718
What is the going rate
on dust bunnies?

15:27.136 --> 15:28.846
What I mean to say is,
this folder seems to be

15:29.012 --> 15:30.722
quite valuable to you.

15:33.684 --> 15:34.476
Well...

15:35.519 --> 15:36.478
I'm guessing you
don't want money,

15:36.645 --> 15:38.480
because,uh,
it's worthless.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.774
I don't tend to
carry snacks on me.

15:41.442 --> 15:42.901
And if I had any bullets,

15:43.068 --> 15:44.194
I would just shoot you
and take the folder.

15:44.361 --> 15:46.029
So what is it that
you would like?

15:46.447 --> 15:48.073
Your expertise.

15:49.283 --> 15:49.992
Surely you've noticed

15:50.159 --> 15:51.952
the giant plume of smoke
in the sky?

15:52.870 --> 15:56.039
Someone blew up a building
we were using to house refugees.

15:56.540 --> 15:57.875
We need to figure out
how they did it,

15:58.041 --> 16:00.294
so we can prevent them
from doing it again.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.631
So, the second smartest man
in Gotham...

16:05.966 --> 16:07.176
needs my help.

16:07.426 --> 16:09.136
Explosives are not my expertise.

16:09.303 --> 16:10.554
Didn't realize you had one.

16:10.679 --> 16:11.513
Hmm.

16:14.808 --> 16:15.809
Just"

16:16.393 --> 16:17.144
Why?

16:20.522 --> 16:21.315
(exhales)

16:21.773 --> 16:23.066
Do we have a deal or not?

16:26.320 --> 16:27.154
Fine.

16:30.908 --> 16:32.493
"(door opens)
- (sighs)

16:32.743 --> 16:33.494
(gunshon

16:37.873 --> 16:39.958
I did not make that building
go boom, Jim.

16:40.584 --> 16:41.543
Oh, please!

16:41.960 --> 16:44.296
You gave up any shred
of honor long ago!

16:44.505 --> 16:46.423
Why should we believe
a snake like you?!

16:46.590 --> 16:49.843
Because I would never take
credit for somebody else's work.

16:50.135 --> 16:52.930
Oh, no, you'd just betray
anyone and everyone

16:53.096 --> 16:54.515
for the right price!

16:55.224 --> 16:56.808
Is this about Sofia Falcone?

16:56.975 --> 16:58.227
Because you should
really move past that.

16:58.393 --> 16:59.269
It's not healthy.

16:59.436 --> 17:00.229
(gunshon

17:04.066 --> 17:05.733
Oswald, concentrate.

17:06.068 --> 17:07.361
Do you and your men
have enough ammo

17:07.528 --> 17:09.488
to keep Zsasz pinned down
for a couple of minutes?

17:10.696 --> 17:13.157
For you, Jim, let's say...
two and a half.

17:13.534 --> 17:15.536
Concentrate all your fire
on that window up there.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.579
Give me everything you got,
then abruptly cease fire.

17:19.122 --> 17:20.290
YOU can count on me.

17:20.457 --> 17:21.625
Spread the word.

17:22.751 --> 17:24.127
MAN: All right,
guys, gather around,

17:24.294 --> 17:25.628
we got new orders.

17:27.005 --> 17:28.006
All right.

17:28.507 --> 17:29.216
Ready?

17:29.675 --> 17:30.467
Yeah.

17:33.554 --> 17:34.429
NQW!

17:34.638 --> 17:36.598
Fire!

17:58.745 --> 18:00.414
Keep it coming!

18:09.172 --> 18:11.008
(slurping)

18:15.095 --> 18:16.513
(watch beeping)

18:16.680 --> 18:17.598
Cease fire!

18:18.098 --> 18:19.099
Cease fire!

18:19.516 --> 18:20.684
Cease fire!

18:33.071 --> 18:34.781
Glad to see
you're still with us.

18:41.705 --> 18:44.249
Thank you. Thank you.
You were great.

18:44.416 --> 18:45.542
Glad there's
no hard feelings.

18:45.709 --> 18:47.294
Day's not over yet.
Come on.

18:48.420 --> 18:49.463
Well done, Jim.

18:50.422 --> 18:51.757
We make a hell of a team.

18:52.341 --> 18:53.091
That man is a menace.

18:53.258 --> 18:54.384
Allow me to deal with him.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.095
This is about more than just
your vendetta against Zsasz.

18:57.262 --> 18:58.513
If he did this,
I need to know

18:58.680 --> 19:00.140
if it was a part
of something larger.

19:00.891 --> 19:02.184
My point exactly.

19:03.226 --> 19:04.645
One of the areas
in which I excel

19:04.811 --> 19:06.813
is the loosening
of tongues.

19:07.064 --> 19:08.732
No. He's mine.

19:16.865 --> 19:19.284
(siren wails)

19:19.451 --> 19:22.621
<i>IS'</i>

19:45.727 --> 19:47.562
(people coughing)

19:53.235 --> 19:55.487
SYKES: You're pushing my men
way too hard.

19:56.154 --> 19:56.905
We're not gonna
break through

19:57.072 --> 19:58.865
for at least
a couple more days.

19:59.574 --> 20:02.619
There is absolutely no way
to make it on schedule.

20:04.413 --> 20:06.081
(choking)

20:16.133 --> 20:19.052
Well, not with <i>that</i> attitude,
you're not.

20:21.555 --> 20:22.431
Now...

20:22.931 --> 20:24.099
everyone...

20:24.725 --> 20:26.893
let's reach inside and dig...

20:27.394 --> 20:29.938
a little deeper, shall we?

20:30.897 --> 20:31.773
'Cause that's the only way

20:31.940 --> 20:34.568
you're all making it out
of this hole.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.581
Come on.
Put this on.

20:49.791 --> 20:53.837
(muttering)

20:54.004 --> 20:55.213
(giggling)

20:56.798 --> 20:58.133
(continues giggling)

21:01.011 --> 21:02.095
(clears throat)

21:03.138 --> 21:05.140
Are these all
the recruits?

21:06.933 --> 21:08.852
Well, I thought
you would want quality

21:09.019 --> 21:10.020
over quantity.

21:10.353 --> 21:13.398
Not everybody can pass
a .38 caliber test of faith.

21:14.858 --> 21:16.067
(gasps)

21:19.154 --> 21:20.280
Yes...

21:20.947 --> 21:24.367
you certainly have
set a very high bar

21:24.534 --> 21:26.203
- for devotion.
-(gasps)

21:26.745 --> 21:27.954
(sighs)

21:28.622 --> 21:30.499
Oh. Almost forgot.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.418
Bruce Wayne
and his sidekick Curls...

21:34.377 --> 21:36.296
Or is he the sidekick?
(giggles)

21:36.463 --> 21:40.050
Anyway, they tried to infiltrate
our little operation here.

21:40.342 --> 21:41.676
- Oh?
- Oh.

21:42.135 --> 21:44.679
And Curls can walk,
really well,

21:44.888 --> 21:45.847
especially...

21:46.473 --> 21:47.724
for a paraplegic.

21:50.435 --> 21:52.854
Ah. And she wants
to kill you.

21:53.522 --> 21:56.274
A lot, FYI.

21:57.526 --> 21:59.653
If I see her,
I'll give you a shout.

22:00.195 --> 22:03.114
Oh... and kill her.

22:03.365 --> 22:04.324
Mm.

22:12.541 --> 22:14.209
Okay, recruits,

22:14.376 --> 22:15.752
let's do like my daddy did

22:15.919 --> 22:18.880
before my sixth birthday
and move out.

22:46.449 --> 22:47.284
Ed?

22:50.161 --> 22:53.331
The building's superstructure
is largely intact,

22:53.874 --> 22:56.418
which would rule out
C-4 and Semtex.

22:58.461 --> 23:00.547
Evidence of deflagration
would suggest something

23:00.714 --> 23:03.758
with a slower burn rate,
like gunpowder

23:03.925 --> 23:05.385
or nitroglycerin.

23:05.552 --> 23:06.803
But for this level
of destruction,

23:06.970 --> 23:08.179
that would require
a bomb that's...

23:08.346 --> 23:10.098
20 cubic feet
of explosive material.

23:10.265 --> 23:12.183
There's no way you could sneak
something that size into the building.

23:12.350 --> 23:15.270
All the entrances were guarded,
which suggests maybe

23:15.437 --> 23:17.063
that this was
an inside job.

23:18.607 --> 23:19.441
Or...

23:21.568 --> 23:23.778
...a classic
locked-room mystery.

23:24.779 --> 23:28.116
Man walks into a room, alone,
and is later found murdered.

23:28.325 --> 23:30.702
There are no windows,
and one door,

23:30.911 --> 23:33.246
which is locked
from the inside.

23:33.955 --> 23:35.916
The killer was already
inside the room.

23:36.207 --> 23:38.335
So, the bomb was already
inside the building?

23:38.793 --> 23:39.586
No.

23:40.003 --> 23:43.048
The bomb was the building.

23:43.214 --> 23:44.674
You don't need to
smuggle in explosives

23:44.841 --> 23:46.968
when you can detonate
250 gallons

23:47.135 --> 23:49.095
of highly pressurized
heating oil

23:49.262 --> 23:50.889
that's coursing through
all the floors.

23:51.306 --> 23:54.142
True, but that doesn't
explain this.

23:55.602 --> 23:56.269
Glass?

23:56.436 --> 23:57.854
Presumably from there.

24:00.941 --> 24:02.108
No, there's no
way that that

24:02.275 --> 24:03.985
would blast in
with that explosion.

24:04.152 --> 24:06.112
That would make all of that
glass go out onto the street.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.698
Unless whatever ignited
those heating oil tanks...

24:08.865 --> 24:10.283
BOTH:
Smashed through that window.

24:14.162 --> 24:15.163
Ow.

24:16.081 --> 24:17.457
This is a really nice table.

24:17.958 --> 24:19.751
We got a dozen
witnesses that saw you

24:19.918 --> 24:22.253
walk out of that building
before it went kabooey.

24:22.671 --> 24:25.090
Yeah. I heard some gangs
had taken over.

24:25.507 --> 24:27.258
Figured, with you guys occupied,

24:27.425 --> 24:29.511
I might help myself
to some of your supplies.

24:29.844 --> 24:31.429
Hey, do you guys have
any canned peaches?

24:31.680 --> 24:34.265
Man, I'd trade an arm and a leg
for that right now.

24:34.891 --> 24:36.977
Not mine, somebody else's.

24:38.728 --> 24:40.563
If you're innocent,
why shoot up

24:40.730 --> 24:42.148
a city block full of cops?

24:43.024 --> 24:46.152
Because it was full of cops,

24:46.486 --> 24:48.363
who were also trying
to shoot me.

24:48.530 --> 24:50.448
And, guys, those were
warning shots. I mean,

24:50.615 --> 24:52.617
if I really wanted
to kill you...

24:54.077 --> 24:56.454
- you'd be dead.
- You got a pen?

24:56.871 --> 24:58.707
I want to write this guy
a thank-you letter.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.709
ZSASZ:
Do the math.

25:00.917 --> 25:02.752
If I blew up a building
full of people,

25:03.128 --> 25:05.338
I would have covered
every inch of my body

25:05.505 --> 25:07.215
in sweet, sweet scars.

25:07.716 --> 25:09.175
You guys want to do
a strip search?

25:09.509 --> 25:10.760
(door opens)

25:11.344 --> 25:12.971
Got Lucius on the horn
for you, Cap.

25:13.805 --> 25:14.848
Stay on him.

25:17.726 --> 25:19.394
I'd let Alvarez do it.

25:20.478 --> 25:21.604
He's handsome.

25:22.772 --> 25:24.107
Lucius, talk to me.

25:24.441 --> 25:26.067
LUCIUS: Haven wasn't
destroyed by a bomb.

25:26.234 --> 25:28.570
It was an RPG, like the one
that took down the chopper.

25:29.320 --> 25:30.071
You sure?

25:30.280 --> 25:32.115
I'm holding what's left of it
in my hand right now.

25:32.282 --> 25:33.700
We found pieces of it
in the rubble.

25:34.284 --> 25:35.660
It was fired through
the basement window,

25:35.827 --> 25:37.412
detonated the fuel oil tank.

25:37.579 --> 25:38.913
And we're still trying
to figure out exactly

25:39.080 --> 25:40.665
which rooftop it was fired from.

25:40.832 --> 25:42.459
- Rooftop?
- LUCIUS: Yes.

25:42.625 --> 25:45.128
The only angle you could
hit this tank from is above.

25:45.628 --> 25:47.380
Our only suspect was
on the ground.

25:47.547 --> 25:48.673
Zsasz was seen
leaving the building

25:48.840 --> 25:50.050
moments before it blew.

25:51.134 --> 25:53.053
Looks like you need
a new suspect.

25:54.471 --> 25:56.347
Jim!
(chuckles)

25:57.390 --> 25:59.642
Ah. I know the
wheels of justice

25:59.809 --> 26:01.895
turn slowly,
so I'm here to provide

26:02.062 --> 26:03.938
- a modicum of grease.
- Oswald,

26:04.272 --> 26:05.857
you need to leave right now.

26:06.024 --> 26:08.193
Still claiming
he's innocent, is he?

26:08.359 --> 26:10.779
Yes. And as much as I hate
to admit it,

26:10.945 --> 26:12.363
the evidence is backing him up.

26:12.530 --> 26:13.490
What the hell's going on?

26:13.656 --> 26:14.908
Harvey,
according to Lucius,

26:15.033 --> 26:17.077
- Zsasz couldn't have done it.
- (Oswald sighs)

26:17.535 --> 26:20.997
I did not expect you
to go soft, Jim.

26:22.624 --> 26:23.458
Actually, I did.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.502
Which is why I didn't
come alone. (whistles)

26:25.668 --> 26:28.338
- ♪ ♪
- (chuckles)

26:36.429 --> 26:37.847
Bring me Victor Zsasz.

26:39.516 --> 26:40.683
Torturing...

26:43.103 --> 26:47.065
Torturing Zsasz into confessing
won't give the people justice.

26:47.649 --> 26:49.651
As misguided as he is,

26:50.026 --> 26:52.654
my old friend Jim is correct
in this instance.

26:53.238 --> 26:55.698
Despite our enflamed
passions,

26:55.865 --> 26:58.243
we cannot rush to judgment.

26:58.910 --> 27:01.538
- There will be a trial.
- MEN: Yeah!

27:01.996 --> 27:04.833
And we will let
the people decide.

27:04.958 --> 27:06.459
MEN:
Yeah!

27:07.293 --> 27:10.213
Good to know who's
really in charge here, Jim.

27:29.566 --> 27:31.276
LUCIUS:
This is it, the exact place

27:31.442 --> 27:33.236
where the RPG was fired.

27:35.196 --> 27:36.197
Impressive.

27:36.614 --> 27:37.740
Calculated the angle
of incident

27:37.907 --> 27:40.952
to follow the trajectory through the
window, into the fuel oil tanks.

27:41.494 --> 27:42.412
Yep.

27:43.163 --> 27:45.957
That, and the RPG case
is right over there.

27:55.592 --> 27:57.427
So, now we know how it was done;

27:58.344 --> 28:00.638
hopefully this holds
some clues as to who.

28:05.435 --> 28:06.769
I should get this
back to the lab.

28:07.103 --> 28:08.188
Doubtful that someone
who could pull off

28:08.354 --> 28:11.357
such an intricate plot
would forget to wear gloves.

28:11.941 --> 28:13.902
True, but it's all
I've got to go on.

28:14.235 --> 28:17.030
Well, maybe I'm wrong.

28:18.615 --> 28:19.824
I hope so.

28:22.035 --> 28:24.704
I truly hope that you
find whoever did this...

28:25.830 --> 28:27.457
and you make them pay.

28:32.545 --> 28:33.922
As promised.

28:36.382 --> 28:37.842
I appreciate your help, Ed.

28:38.218 --> 28:39.552
Couldn't have done it
without you.

28:40.345 --> 28:42.972
And if you tell anyone
I said that, I will deny it.

28:48.519 --> 28:52.398
"Inmate number 1215.
Frank McCann."

28:53.107 --> 28:54.442
(quietly):
Frank McCann.

28:55.068 --> 28:57.111
Deceased? No!

28:57.779 --> 29:01.282
No! No, you can't be dead!

29:01.741 --> 29:04.994
(Shouts) No!

29:05.370 --> 29:06.412
(shouts)

29:13.169 --> 29:15.463
Lucius! Hey!

29:15.755 --> 29:19.133
Di... Did you see
who blew up this building?

29:20.051 --> 29:22.011
Hey! (groans)

29:23.012 --> 29:24.472
Deaf old bat.

29:25.848 --> 29:27.725
Hopefully she's not blind, too.

29:32.230 --> 29:33.815
(excited chatter)

29:33.982 --> 29:35.108
(door opens)

29:37.986 --> 29:39.070
MAN:
There he is.

29:39.237 --> 29:41.447
(chatter continues)

29:44.367 --> 29:45.702
BULLOCK:
I got no love for Zsasz,

29:45.868 --> 29:47.745
but are we really gonna
let this happen?

29:48.329 --> 29:49.706
Look at them, Harvey.

29:50.707 --> 29:54.669
If we try to stop it, they'll
turn that anger against us.

29:55.253 --> 29:56.379
We've got to
do something.

29:56.546 --> 29:58.423
Yeah? Like what?

29:59.340 --> 30:01.134
I make another speech?

30:03.261 --> 30:05.471
Maybe this is what
the people need.

30:08.224 --> 30:10.268
- (gavel bangs)
- Order in the court!

30:10.977 --> 30:14.522
So, um, will I be appointed
a lawyer?

30:14.731 --> 30:17.066
I feel like my rights are
being violated.

30:17.358 --> 30:20.111
Not your right
to remain silent. Bailiff.

30:20.278 --> 30:22.655
No! no! no; n0, "C...

30:26.492 --> 30:30.330
And where exactly did
you see the defendant

30:30.747 --> 30:32.623
minutes before the explosion?

30:33.207 --> 30:34.751
Coming out of the building.

30:35.585 --> 30:38.713
The very building that
mere moments later

30:38.880 --> 30:41.591
was engulfed in flames
that would claim

30:41.841 --> 30:44.010
so many beloved souls?

30:44.469 --> 30:46.220
(crying)

30:46.429 --> 30:48.222
(quiet chatter)

30:54.896 --> 30:55.730
Are there any other witnesses

30:55.897 --> 30:57.065
who can back up
this man's claim? Oh.

30:57.231 --> 30:58.316
- Here.
- Yep. Here.

31:01.486 --> 31:03.279
(chuckles weakly)

31:04.781 --> 31:07.784
Captain Gordon would
have this court believe

31:07.950 --> 31:11.496
that all of you
fine citizens are mistaken.

31:11.662 --> 31:13.498
(crowd exclaiming)

31:13.748 --> 31:17.877
He claims that Mr. Zsasz is not
responsible for the bombing.

31:18.086 --> 31:20.213
(crowd exclaiming)

31:25.009 --> 31:27.470
Captain Gordon, if you would
like to say something,

31:27.720 --> 31:28.971
now is the time.

31:29.138 --> 31:31.224
(overlapping chatter)

31:32.266 --> 31:33.768
MAN:
Tell us something.

31:34.060 --> 31:35.937
<i>IS'</i>

31:38.523 --> 31:39.941
It wasn't a bomb.

31:40.024 --> 31:42.610
(crowd exclaiming)

31:43.611 --> 31:45.071
GORDON:
It wasn't a bomb.

31:45.238 --> 31:47.156
Shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh.

31:47.365 --> 31:51.119
A rocket-propelled grenade,
fired from a rooftop.

31:52.662 --> 31:56.290
If Zsasz was on the ground,
as your witnesses claim,

31:57.250 --> 31:58.793
he couldn't have done it.

32:05.508 --> 32:07.385
I know you all want justice.

32:08.261 --> 32:09.470
So do I.

32:10.721 --> 32:11.764
You're angry.

32:13.808 --> 32:15.101
You're scared.

32:16.519 --> 32:18.438
For months now, you've
been hearing me say

32:18.729 --> 32:20.189
help is coming.

32:22.567 --> 32:24.694
Truth is, we may be on our own.

32:27.780 --> 32:29.407
And if that's true,

32:30.741 --> 32:33.995
what we do now is
more important than ever.

32:35.955 --> 32:37.039
This...

32:38.958 --> 32:40.751
This is not justice.

32:43.212 --> 32:45.047
This is not justice.

32:48.009 --> 32:49.719
It's not who we are.

32:53.764 --> 32:54.474
I'll consider that

32:54.640 --> 32:56.392
your closing argument.

32:57.810 --> 33:03.024
Now that the defense has rested,
let's put it to the crowd.

33:05.401 --> 33:08.237
What say you, jury?

33:13.367 --> 33:16.370
CROWD:
Guilty!

33:16.579 --> 33:18.748
(overlapping shouting)

33:18.998 --> 33:21.834
(chanting):
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

33:25.463 --> 33:27.423
(chanting continues)

33:34.889 --> 33:38.392
(cheering, shouting)

33:49.237 --> 33:50.404
(gavel banging)

33:53.115 --> 33:54.825
By the power vested in me

33:55.326 --> 33:57.954
by... well, me,

33:58.704 --> 34:02.250
I sentence you,
Victor Zsasz,

34:02.875 --> 34:04.043
to die.

34:05.711 --> 34:07.046
Any last words?

34:08.880 --> 34:14.929
(muffled mumbling)

34:15.804 --> 34:16.889
Well said.

34:17.056 --> 34:19.433
- (people screaming)
- Get him out of there.

34:22.770 --> 34:23.980
Overruled!

34:27.483 --> 34:29.694
What the hell are you doing?!

34:29.860 --> 34:32.154
Trying to keep you all
from making a terrible mistake.

34:32.321 --> 34:33.197
OSWALD:
See?

34:33.572 --> 34:39.286
Jim Gordon cares more
about protecting a murderer

34:39.620 --> 34:41.539
than he does
about protecting you!

34:42.331 --> 34:43.666
You've lost them, Jim.

34:44.708 --> 34:46.585
They don't believe in you
anymore.

34:47.712 --> 34:49.170
They're mine now.

35:05.396 --> 35:06.188
BULLOCK:
I got to be honest, Jim,

35:06.355 --> 35:09.150
I don't know how safe
Zsasz will be at the GCPD.

35:09.984 --> 35:12.737
There's more than a few cops
that want to see him on a slab.

35:13.362 --> 35:14.739
GORDON: That's why
we're not taking him there.

35:16.699 --> 35:19.994
Wait. Tell me this is not
a catch and release.

35:20.161 --> 35:23.039
What choice do I have?
Either I let him go,

35:23.497 --> 35:25.416
or he's dead
for something he didn't do.

35:33.841 --> 35:34.842
Thank you, Jim.

35:35.176 --> 35:36.302
I'm not doing this
for you.

35:36.636 --> 35:37.720
Of course not.

35:38.095 --> 35:40.931
This city will never be
what you want it to be, Jim.

35:41.974 --> 35:46.270
It's always gonna belong
to the bad guys, like me.

35:54.028 --> 35:55.780
Give him your gun, Harvey.

35:56.614 --> 35:57.323
What?

35:57.490 --> 35:58.866
Yeah. What?

36:00.451 --> 36:01.952
Give him your gun.

36:03.537 --> 36:04.205
Jim.

36:04.372 --> 36:06.916
- Do it!
- ZSASZ: You got a death wish, Jim?

36:08.125 --> 36:09.126
'Cause I'll kill you.

36:10.086 --> 36:11.045
Harvey, too.

36:11.837 --> 36:12.713
Maybe.

36:13.881 --> 36:16.342
Maybe I'm just tired
of listening to you, Victor.

36:22.807 --> 36:23.891
Do it.

36:31.148 --> 36:32.733
You know what? You seem tired.

36:34.527 --> 36:35.486
Maybe we should
do this

36:35.653 --> 36:37.363
another day, yeah?

36:39.949 --> 36:42.660
People like you are always
trying to own this city.

36:43.202 --> 36:44.662
But you never will.

36:45.788 --> 36:48.082
Now get the hell out of my face.

36:50.918 --> 36:52.336
See you around, Jim.

37:00.553 --> 37:01.721
A shoot-out?

37:02.096 --> 37:03.764
- Are you serious?
- What? I could've taken him.

37:03.931 --> 37:05.933
That's not the
point. Never...

37:06.809 --> 37:09.437
ever ask me to do anything
like that again.

37:10.563 --> 37:12.231
Pull yourself together.

37:29.039 --> 37:31.083
(grunting, screaming)

37:48.601 --> 37:54.273
You see, a river cuts through
rock not because of its power,

37:54.440 --> 37:57.109
but because of its persistence.

37:57.693 --> 38:00.488
So what do we do
when we feel like giving up?

38:00.654 --> 38:02.239
WORKERS:
Dig a little deeper.

38:02.406 --> 38:07.036
And what do we do when we can't
possibly go on any longer?

38:07.203 --> 38:09.121
WORKERS:
Dig a little deeper.

38:09.288 --> 38:10.623
And what do we...

38:13.959 --> 38:14.794
SELINA:
Deep enough?

38:14.960 --> 38:16.837
(gasping)

38:21.759 --> 38:25.221

38:26.055 --> 38:27.389

Well, Selina,

38:27.848 --> 38:29.058
I must say...

38:29.391 --> 38:30.351
(gasps)

38:30.851 --> 38:34.980
Don't say anything.

38:41.821 --> 38:42.947

38:43.113 --> 38:44.615
- Selina!
- Let me go!

38:44.782 --> 38:46.659

It's done! It's over.

38:46.992 --> 38:48.410

38:49.078 --> 38:50.704

out of here, now.

39:20.276 --> 39:21.443

39:27.366 --> 39:28.659

Listen, lady, I'm not
gonna hurt you.

39:55.853 --> 39:58.814
I just want to know
what you saw.

39:59.773 --> 40:01.817
Uh, uh, the-the roof.

40:02.026 --> 40:03.736
You, you were on the roof.

40:03.903 --> 40:06.447
And you had
some kind of a, uh,

40:06.614 --> 40:09.575
you had some kind of a,
of a rocket.

40:11.076 --> 40:11.785
Mm.

40:12.036 --> 40:13.370
That's, that's not possible.

40:13.537 --> 40:18.042
Uh, and-and you shot it
at-at-at that building.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I promise,

41:06.340 --> 41:08.467
I won't tell anybody.

41:09.927 --> 41:11.470

You said you wouldn't hurt me.

You forget to pay
the electric bill?

41:52.136 --> 41:53.512
What do you want, Barbara?

41:54.179 --> 41:55.347
Same as you.

41:56.306 --> 41:58.017
To protect my people.

41:58.684 --> 42:00.769
Your tip didn't pan out.

42:02.521 --> 42:04.064
Well, I've got another one.

42:06.025 --> 42:08.235
A lead on a guy selling RPGs.

He moves about, but...

42:12.489 --> 42:13.532
That all?

42:16.160 --> 42:18.871
I heard some of your people
went over to Penguin.

42:20.539 --> 42:21.540
Yeah.

42:22.875 --> 42:24.501
Well, you can't
win them all.

42:26.336 --> 42:27.796
Poor Jim.

42:28.756 --> 42:30.507
All alone again.

42:33.427 --> 42:35.179
Get out of here, Barbara.

42:39.725 --> 42:41.810
No one knows
what it's like to be him.

42:45.189 --> 42:47.232
To carry the weight.

42:49.359 --> 42:50.944

42:52.946 --> 42:54.490
I heard you.
