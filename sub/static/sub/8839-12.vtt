WEBVTT

01:21.122 --> 01:22.873
HERE, SUEY, SUEY, SUEY.

01:23.041 --> 01:26.543
HERE, COME AND GET IT.
COME ON.

01:28.755 --> 01:32.674
HEY, GERTRUDE,
WHERE ARE YOUR
MANNERS?

01:32.842 --> 01:35.427
STOP EATING IT
ALL UP FROM HENRY.

01:35.595 --> 01:37.513
YOU'RE JUST
A NATURAL-BORN PIG.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.265
[LAUGHS]

01:40.433 --> 01:42.684
[WAGON APPROACHING]

01:52.612 --> 01:55.114
- MORNING, JOE.
- CHARLES.

01:55.281 --> 01:57.032
HOW'S
EVERYTHING
GOING?

01:57.200 --> 01:58.575
UH, CAN'T
COMPLAIN.

01:58.743 --> 02:00.911
GROWING ENOUGH
CROP TO KEEP BODY
AND SOUL TOGETHER.

02:01.079 --> 02:02.955
YEAH, WELL, SPEAKING
OF SOUL, THAT'S
WHY I STOPPED BY.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.499
JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW
THE ELDERS OF THE CHURCH
ARE MEETING TONIGHT

02:05.667 --> 02:07.417
ON YOUR APPLICATION
FOR MEMBERSHIP.

02:07.585 --> 02:09.378
[LAUGHS]
AGAIN?

02:09.546 --> 02:12.840
THAT'S RIGHT, AGAIN.
I'LL DO MY BEST.

02:13.007 --> 02:16.927
I KNOW THAT, BUT
I STILL AIN'T GOING
TO HOLD MY BREATH.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.595
ONE THING, THOUGH...

02:18.763 --> 02:21.640
THE GOOD LORD LISTENS
WHENEVER AND WHEREVER
A BODY PRAYS TO HIM.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.685
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
HOW IT TURNS OUT.

02:24.853 --> 02:25.811
OKAY.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.438
- HAVE A GOOD DAY. HYAH!
- BYE.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.902
[PIGS GRUNTING]

02:38.074 --> 02:40.367
OH, SHUT UP.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.955
HERE YOU GO,
HERE YOU GO.

02:45.123 --> 02:49.001
SOME FOLKS THINK THE
ONLY PLACE FOR A NIGGER
TO SAY HIS PRAYERS

02:49.169 --> 02:52.045
IS RIGHT HERE.
OINK.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.884
I HATE
"DIBISION."

02:57.051 --> 02:59.845
WHAT'S
"DIBISION"?

03:00.013 --> 03:01.680
ARITHMETIC.

03:01.848 --> 03:05.142
[CHUCKLES]
CARRIE, YOU
MEAN DIVISION.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.144
I STILL
HATE IT.

03:07.312 --> 03:08.979
I LIKE IT.

03:09.147 --> 03:12.649
THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE ALWAYS
GETTING As.

03:12.817 --> 03:15.819
I'M GOING TO
THE OUTHOUSE.

03:15.987 --> 03:18.447
[LAUGHS]

03:19.532 --> 03:21.450
PA, I HAVE TO GO.

03:21.618 --> 03:24.494
ALL RIGHT, YOU GO AHEAD.
THEN GET RIGHT BACK TO
YOUR HOMEWORK, ALL RIGHT?

03:24.662 --> 03:26.455
YES, SIR.

03:26.623 --> 03:29.917
CHARLES, YOU'VE TRIED
TWICE BEFORE TO GET JOE
KAGAN INTO THE CHURCH.

03:30.084 --> 03:32.502
BOTH TIMES IT ENDED
EXACTLY THE SAME WAY,

03:32.670 --> 03:37.049
A TIE VOTE BETWEEN
YOU AND JONATHAN
AND DR. BAKER,

03:37.217 --> 03:39.843
AND THE OLESONS
AND MR. LARABEE.

03:40.011 --> 03:43.305
NOW, WHY DO YOU
SUPPOSE IT WILL BE ANY
DIFFERENT THIS TIME?

03:43.473 --> 03:46.141
I DON'T KNOW.
HOPE SPRINGS
ETERNAL, I GUESS.

03:46.309 --> 03:50.562
[CHUCKLES]
SO DOES MRS. OLESON.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.981
IF I COULD JUST
GET NELS OUT FROM
UNDER HER THUMB...

03:53.149 --> 03:55.567
BUT I SUPPOSE
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

03:57.028 --> 04:00.822
AND JOE PRETENDS
HE DOESN'T CARE,
BUT HE DOES.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.866
HE CARES A LOT.

04:03.034 --> 04:04.826
HERE'S A MAN WHO'S
A HARD WORKER,

04:04.994 --> 04:06.703
A FINE MEMBER
OF THE COMMUNITY,

04:06.871 --> 04:08.372
GOD-LOVING,
GOD-FEARING MAN.

04:08.539 --> 04:10.540
IF ANYBODY DESERVES
TO BE A MEMBER OF THE
WALNUT GROVE CHURCH,

04:10.708 --> 04:12.709
IT'S JOE KAGAN.

04:12.877 --> 04:14.753
IT'S A SHAME THE
BOARD OF ELDERS
ISN'T THE SAME

04:14.921 --> 04:17.256
AS WHEN
MR. HANSON
WAS ALIVE.

04:17.423 --> 04:20.550
THIS WHOLE THING
WOULD HAVE BEEN
SETTLED BY NOW.

04:20.718 --> 04:23.428
YEAH. WELL, I'D
BETTER GET GOING.

04:23.596 --> 04:26.515
I DON'T MAKE THE
MEETING, WE WON'T
EVEN HAVE A TIE.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.976
PRAY FOR
A MIRACLE.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.106
I SIMPLY DO
NOT UNDERSTAND

04:34.274 --> 04:35.774
WHY WE HAVE
TO BOTHER
VOTING AGAIN.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.943
IT SEEMS TO ME
IT'S A WASTE
OF TIME.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.821
WHAT DO YOU GOT
AGAINST JOE KAGAN?

04:40.989 --> 04:42.656
NOTHING.
NOTHING PERSONAL.

04:42.824 --> 04:46.493
HE'S A GOOD-ENOUGH
DARKY, I SUPPOSE,
AS DARKIES GO.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.787
IT'S A MATTER
OF PRINCIPLE.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.414
WHAT PRINCIPLE
IS THAT, HARRIET?

04:50.581 --> 04:52.666
OH, FOR HEAVEN'S
SAKE, DON'T YOU
KNOW YOUR BIBLE?

04:52.834 --> 04:56.503
IT EXPLICITLY SAYS,
"LOOK NOT UPON ME,
BECAUSE I AM BLACK."

04:56.671 --> 04:58.171
THAT'S FROM
THE SONG OF
SOLOMON, HARRIET.

04:58.339 --> 05:01.174
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE A LOVE SONG,
NOT HATE PROPAGANDA.

05:01.342 --> 05:03.593
AND THE QUOTATION
GOES ON TO SAY,

05:03.761 --> 05:06.763
"I AM BLACK
BECAUSE THE SUN
HATH DARKENED ME."

05:06.931 --> 05:11.268
AND IT ALSO
SAYS, "I AM BLACK
BUT BEAUTIFUL."

05:11.436 --> 05:13.103
AND THAT ONLY
GOES TO PROVE

05:13.271 --> 05:16.023
THAT EVEN THE
DEVIL CAN QUOTE
THE SCRIPTURES.

05:16.190 --> 05:17.858
I KNOW.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.277
MOTHER SAYS THAT
COLORED PEOPLE
ARE THAT WAY

05:20.445 --> 05:21.445
BECAUSE THEY BEAR
THE MARK OF CAIN.

05:21.612 --> 05:23.113
YES.

05:23.281 --> 05:26.491
AND SO THEY'RE NEVER
GOING TO GET INTO HEAVEN.
IS THAT RIGHT, FATHER?

05:26.659 --> 05:28.285
OF COURSE
NOT!

05:28.453 --> 05:30.412
HOW DARE YOU
CONTRADICT ME?

05:30.580 --> 05:34.041
WELL, SHE ALSO SAYS
THAT COLORED PEOPLE
DON'T HAVE SOULS,

05:34.208 --> 05:36.835
BECAUSE THEY'RE
NOT MADE IN
THE IMAGE OF GOD.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.962
OH.

05:39.130 --> 05:43.133
OH, HAVE YOU
ACTUALLY SEEN
GOD, HARRIET?

05:44.427 --> 05:48.055
WELL...
[LAUGHS]
NOT YET,

05:48.222 --> 05:50.682
BUT EVERYONE
KNOWS THAT GOD
IS A WHITE MAN.

05:50.850 --> 05:54.144
I DON'T KNOW IT.
I DON'T KNOW THAT
HE'S ANY COLOR AT ALL!

05:54.312 --> 05:55.854
ONE THING
I'M ABSOLUTELY
SURE OF

05:56.022 --> 05:58.940
IS THAT HE DOESN'T
CARE WHAT COLOR
A PERSON'S SKIN IS

05:59.108 --> 06:01.902
AS LONG AS
HIS SPIRIT
IS PURE.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.613
DON'T LISTEN
TO YOUR FATHER,
NELLIE.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.615
HE'LL POISON
YOUR MIND
WITH HERESY.

06:06.783 --> 06:09.326
NOW, COME ALONG!
I NEED YOUR VOTE.

06:09.494 --> 06:13.288
WE'LL CONTINUE THIS
DISCUSSION LATER ON,
AND YOU WILL LISTEN.

06:13.456 --> 06:16.625
Harriet:
NELS, COME ON!

06:18.461 --> 06:20.295
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU SAY.

06:20.463 --> 06:23.673
PERSONS LIKE JOE
KAGAN HAVE THEIR
OWN RELIGION.

06:23.841 --> 06:26.176
THEY HAVE
THEIR AFRICAN
WITCH DOCTORS

06:26.344 --> 06:29.137
AND THEIR
VOODOO DRUMS
AND DANCING,

06:29.305 --> 06:32.182
AND THEY HAVE
THEIR SPELLS AND
THEIR MASKS,

06:32.350 --> 06:35.060
AND EATING
PEOPLE!

06:35.228 --> 06:38.230
HARRIET, THIS
IS AMERICA,
NOT AFRICA!

06:38.398 --> 06:40.857
OH, YES,
AND IT'S PROBABLY
A GOOD THING IT IS,

06:41.025 --> 06:42.484
OTHERWISE WE MAY
NOT ALL BE HERE.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.903
MRS. OLESON, JOE
KAGAN'S FAMILY HAS
BEEN IN THIS COUNTRY

06:45.071 --> 06:46.655
LONGER THAN
YOURS, 180 YEARS.

06:46.823 --> 06:50.659
HE'S 100%  AMERICAN,
A FULL-FLEDGED CITIZEN
OF THE UNITED STATES.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.370
HE'S A GOOD CHRISTIAN.
HE'D LIKE TO PRACTICE
HIS RELIGION

06:53.538 --> 06:55.205
WITH THE MEMBERS
OF HIS COMMUNITY.

06:55.373 --> 06:58.667
HE'S TRYING TO WORM
HIS WAY INTO OUR CHURCH,

06:58.835 --> 07:01.503
AND WHO KNOWS
FOR WHAT DARK REASONS?

07:01.671 --> 07:03.171
YOU WOULDN'T
WANT YOUR WIVES
AND CHILDREN

07:03.339 --> 07:06.258
PRAYING IN THE SAME
PEW WITH JOE KAGAN,
WOULD YOU?

07:06.426 --> 07:07.926
- YES, I WOULD.
- SO WOULD I.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.803
PRAYING TO
THE SAME GOD.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.556
WE HAVE BEEN
ALL THROUGH
THIS BEFORE.

07:12.723 --> 07:17.227
NOW, THE POINT IS
THAT JOE KAGAN HAS LED
A VERY UNSAVORY LIFE.

07:17.395 --> 07:20.772
Harriet: HE SPENT THE BETTER
PART OF HIS LIFE BEATING UP
ON GOOD CHRISTIANS.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.941
MRS. OLESON, WE GET
SO SICK AND TIRED OF
HEARING YOU PRETEND

07:23.109 --> 07:25.235
YOU'RE BLACKBALLING
JOE KAGAN BECAUSE
HE WAS A FIGHTER.

07:25.403 --> 07:26.736
THE WAY I HEARD IT,
A LOT OF THOSE
CHRISTIANS

07:26.904 --> 07:28.488
WERE BEATING UP
ON HIM, ANYWAY.

07:28.656 --> 07:32.409
IF I MAY REMIND YOU
OF THE GOSPEL, "GOD
SO LOVED THE WORLD

07:32.577 --> 07:33.869
"THAT HE GAVE HIS
ONLY BEGOTTEN SON

07:34.036 --> 07:36.204
"THAT WHOSOEVER
BELIEVETH IN HIM

07:36.372 --> 07:38.415
SHOULD NOT
PERISH BUT HAVE
EVERLASTING LIFE."

07:38.583 --> 07:42.252
NOW, JOE KAGAN
BELIEVES, AND HE
BELONGS IN THIS CHURCH.

07:44.964 --> 07:49.426
AND MAY I
REMIND YOU,
REVEREND ALDEN,

07:49.594 --> 07:51.136
THAT YOU HAVE
NO VOTE HERE.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.431
Harriet: YOU HAVE NO
VOICE WHATSOEVER IN
THESE PROCEEDINGS.

07:54.599 --> 07:58.768
THIS BOARD OF ELDERS
HAS THE ABILITY
TO VOTE YOU OUT

07:58.936 --> 08:00.187
- AS MINISTER OF THIS PARISH
- ALL RIGHT.

08:00.354 --> 08:02.606
ALL RIGHT, I
SUGGEST WE STICK
TO THE SUBJECT

08:02.773 --> 08:04.941
WE WERE
DISCUSSING.

08:05.109 --> 08:07.569
NOW, WE ARE DISCUSSING
THE APPLICATION
OF JOE KAGAN

08:07.737 --> 08:09.279
FOR MEMBERSHIP
ON OUR CHURCH.

08:09.447 --> 08:10.780
WHAT IT ALL
BOILS DOWN TO,

08:10.948 --> 08:14.493
IS THIS THE CHURCH
OF GOD OR THE CHURCH
OF MRS. OLESON?

08:14.660 --> 08:17.954
HOW DARE YOU,
CHARLES INGALLS!

08:18.122 --> 08:20.707
THERE'S BEEN
ENOUGH TALK.
LET'S VOTE.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.667
PROBLEM IS THAT
SOME OF YOU HAVE
SUCH THICK HEADS,

08:22.835 --> 08:24.961
NOTHING CAN PENETRATE.
NO REASON WHATSOEVER.

08:25.129 --> 08:27.380
MRS. OLESON.

08:27.548 --> 08:31.092
ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF
MR. KAGAN'S APPLICATION
FOR MEMBERSHIP,

08:31.260 --> 08:34.179
PLEASE SIGNIFY BY
RAISING YOUR RIGHT HAND.

08:43.481 --> 08:44.856
IT'S A STANDOFF.

08:45.024 --> 08:48.068
Harriet: WELL, I GUESS
THAT SETTLES THAT
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

08:48.236 --> 08:49.861
WAIT A MINUTE,
HARRIET.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.280
ALL THE VOTES
AREN'T IN YET.

08:55.493 --> 08:57.327
THE AYES HAVE IT!

09:01.040 --> 09:02.832
Jonathan:
OH, NELS, THANK YOU!

09:03.000 --> 09:04.501
Charles: NELS,
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

09:04.669 --> 09:07.837
CONGRATULATIONS,
NELS, YOU'LL GET
YOUR REWARD IN HEAVEN.

09:08.005 --> 09:10.382
WELL, I HOPE
YOU'RE RIGHT,
REVEREND,

09:10.550 --> 09:13.093
BECAUSE IT'S GOING
TO BE HELL ON EARTH
WHEN I GET HOME.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.220
[LAUGHTER]

09:21.435 --> 09:23.478
[DOOR KNOCKS]

09:34.657 --> 09:36.199
CAN WE COME IN
FOR A SECOND?

09:36.367 --> 09:38.326
COME RIGHT IN.

09:43.874 --> 09:45.709
WELL,
YOU'RE HERE.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.210
YEAH, WE
JUST WANTED
YOU TO KNOW

09:47.378 --> 09:50.213
WE CAME FROM THE
MEETING OF THE
CHURCH ELDERS.

09:50.381 --> 09:53.425
YEAH, I GUESS I
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GOING TO TELL ME,

09:53.593 --> 09:56.469
BUT I'VE BEEN
DOING MY PRAYING
RIGHT HERE,

09:56.637 --> 09:57.971
AND OUT IN
THE FIELDS,

09:58.139 --> 10:00.473
UNDER THE STARS,
AND UNDER THE SUN.

10:00.641 --> 10:03.351
I RECKON I CAN
GO ON DOING
THE SAME.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.353
JOE...

10:05.521 --> 10:08.231
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO START DOING YOUR
PRAYING AT CHURCH?

10:13.279 --> 10:14.529
YOU MEAN...

10:14.697 --> 10:17.407
WE MEAN. NELS
OLESON FINALLY GOT
HIS BACKBONE BACK.

10:17.575 --> 10:19.075
CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU'RE A BONA
FIDE MEMBER

10:19.243 --> 10:20.660
OF THE
COMMUNITY CHURCH
OF WALNUT GROVE.

10:20.828 --> 10:23.038
JOE, YOU'RE
ONE OF US NOW.

10:23.205 --> 10:25.457
MAYBE ONE OF YOU,

10:25.625 --> 10:27.334
BUT I'M STILL A HORSE
OF A DIFFERENT COLOR

10:27.501 --> 10:29.878
TO A LOT OF PEOPLE
IN THIS TOWN.

10:31.589 --> 10:36.468
BUT IT'S A START,
A MIGHTY FINE
START, GENTLEMEN.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.095
I GUESS
WE'D BETTER
BE GETTING HOME.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.349
SEE YOU IN CHURCH
ON SUNDAY.

10:42.516 --> 10:44.601
GOOD NIGHT,
JOE.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.398
SEE YOU IN CHURCH,
CHARLIE BOY.

10:50.566 --> 10:51.775
Charles: SEE YOU.

10:51.942 --> 10:53.485
[CHUCKLES]

12:06.934 --> 12:11.354
Boy: THE LAD
HAS A FAT DOG.

12:11.522 --> 12:12.981
THAT'S VERY
GOOD, SUSAN.
YOU GOT 100.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.858
THANK YOU,
MRS. KENDALL.

12:15.025 --> 12:16.151
Boy:
...NAT'S CAP.

12:16.318 --> 12:17.861
Adam: RIGHT.

12:18.028 --> 12:21.489
Boy:
NAT AND RAB RUN.

12:21.657 --> 12:24.409
MARY, ADAM, I HATE
TO INTERRUPT
YOUR CLASS,

12:24.577 --> 12:28.872
BUT I HAVE SOME
NEWS FOR YOU THAT
CONCERNS YOU ALL.

12:29.039 --> 12:33.126
THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST
DIFFICULT THING I EVER
HAD TO DO IN MY LIFE,

12:33.294 --> 12:37.672
BUT, AS SOME OF YOU
KNOW, OUR SCHOOL BUILDING
IS OWNED BY THE CHURCH,

12:37.840 --> 12:41.843
AND THE DEACONS HAVE
GENEROUSLY PERMITTED US
TO OCCUPY IT RENT-FREE,

12:42.011 --> 12:47.098
BUT NOW THE CHURCH IS
IN DESPERATE NEED OF
MONEY TO SUSTAIN ITSELF.

12:47.266 --> 12:51.144
THE REVEREND CORLISS
INFORMED ME 3 WEEKS AGO

12:51.312 --> 12:54.814
THAT THEY'VE
RECEIVED A SIZABLE
OFFER FOR THE PROPERTY.

12:54.982 --> 12:59.694
Mr. Ames: HE JUST
TOLD ME THAT THE DEACONS,
AFTER LONG SOUL-SEARCHING,

12:59.862 --> 13:03.740
HAVE BEEN FORCED
TO ACCEPT THE OFFER.

13:03.908 --> 13:07.160
THEY'VE SOLD
THE PROPERTY.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.664
OUR SCHOOL...

13:11.832 --> 13:13.666
WHAT'LL
HAPPEN TO IT?

13:15.044 --> 13:17.754
I DON'T KNOW.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.590
WE'LL MOVE.
WE'LL FIND
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

13:20.758 --> 13:23.051
FOR THE LAST 3
WEEKS, I'VE BEEN
ALL OVER WINOKA

13:23.219 --> 13:25.762
TRYING TO FIND ANOTHER
SITE FOR OUR SCHOOL.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.931
THERE'S NOTHING.

13:28.098 --> 13:29.933
I...HATE TO SAY THIS,

13:30.100 --> 13:35.438
BUT I'M AFRAID IT MEANS
THE END OF THE WINOKA
ACADEMY FOR THE BLIND.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.109
I'M SORRY.

13:40.986 --> 13:43.488
I DID MY BEST.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.448
WE KNOW THAT, SIR.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.033
SIR...

13:49.995 --> 13:52.163
YOU DIDN'T SAY
HOW LONG WE HAVE.

13:52.331 --> 13:56.626
30 DAYS.
THE NEW OWNER WANTED
IMMEDIATE POSSESSION,

13:56.794 --> 13:58.545
BUT REVEREND CORLISS
AND THE DEACONS

13:58.712 --> 14:02.507
INSISTED THAT THE
SCHOOL BE GIVEN TIME...

14:02.675 --> 14:05.468
TO MAKE OTHER
ARRANGEMENTS.

14:20.484 --> 14:21.901
[DOOR KNOCKS]

14:22.069 --> 14:23.570
COME IN.

14:25.072 --> 14:26.155
GOOD EVENING, SIR.

14:26.323 --> 14:28.324
OH, COME IN, ADAM.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.922
MARY AND I
HAVE BEEN GOING
AROUND AND AROUND,

14:43.090 --> 14:46.259
WRESTLING WITH
OUR PROBLEM,

14:46.427 --> 14:48.094
AND WE HAD
A THOUGHT.

14:48.262 --> 14:51.848
I'D GRAB AT ANY STRAW
TO KEEP THIS SCHOOL
AFLOAT, ADAM.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.474
WHAT IS IT?

14:53.642 --> 14:55.685
WELL, WE THOUGHT
IF YOU PRESENTED
OUR CASE

14:55.853 --> 14:57.687
TO WHOEVER BOUGHT
THE BUILDING,
LET THEM KNOW

14:57.855 --> 14:59.355
THAT WE DON'T
HAVE ANYWHERE
ELSE TO GO--

14:59.523 --> 15:04.027
ADAM, OUR CASE
HAS ALREADY
BEEN DISMISSED.

15:04.194 --> 15:07.113
THE NEW OWNER
IS MR. STANDISH.

15:08.365 --> 15:09.741
MR. STANDISH.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.201
Mr. Ames: HE'S
TURNING THE BUILDING
INTO ANOTHER HOTEL.

15:12.369 --> 15:15.288
WE DON'T NEED
ANOTHER HOTEL.

15:15.456 --> 15:21.961
MR. STANDISH THINKS WE
DON'T NEED AN ASYLUM FOR
THE BLIND, AS HE CALLS IT.

15:22.129 --> 15:24.672
AND HE'S NOT ALONE.

15:24.840 --> 15:30.678
I TRIED EVERYONE
THAT MIGHT POSSIBLY
BE ABLE TO HELP.

15:30.846 --> 15:32.013
NO RESPONSE.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.514
IF WE DON'T FIND
SOMEWHERE TO GO,

15:33.682 --> 15:36.392
IT'S GOING TO
MEAN THE CLOSING
OF TWO SCHOOLS:

15:36.560 --> 15:38.436
OURS AND
MRS. TERHUNE'S.

15:38.604 --> 15:43.524
WELL, WE CAN'T TAKE IN
HER CHILDREN UNLESS WE
HAVE A PLACE OF OUR OWN.

15:43.692 --> 15:47.320
AND JUST WHEN I THOUGHT
THINGS WERE LOOKING UP.

15:47.488 --> 15:50.073
WITH MRS. TERHUNE,
WE WOULD HAVE HAD
A SIGHTED PERSON

15:50.240 --> 15:53.701
WHO COULD BEAR
THE BURDENS OF
ADMINISTRATION,

15:53.869 --> 15:57.121
BUT NOW EVERYTHING
HAS COLLAPSED.

15:57.289 --> 16:00.917
I'LL HAVE TO
TELL HER TO FIND
ANOTHER LOCATION...

16:01.085 --> 16:02.710
IF SHE CAN.

16:02.878 --> 16:06.255
Mr. Ames:
IT'S BAD NEWS
FOR EVERYONE.

16:06.423 --> 16:08.508
MOSTLY THE KIDS.

16:09.927 --> 16:13.763
YES. THE CHILDREN,
ABOVE ALL.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.850
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

16:19.895 --> 16:23.648
I DON'T WANT TO
BELIEVE IT, ADAM,

16:23.816 --> 16:25.775
BUT I HAVE TO.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.447
OH, WELL...

16:31.615 --> 16:33.950
GOOD NIGHT, SIR.

16:34.118 --> 16:36.452
GOOD NIGHT,
MY BOY.

16:56.223 --> 16:57.598
"MR. STANDISH
IS THE NEW OWNER
OF THE BUILDING

16:57.766 --> 17:00.018
"AND WANTS US TO
MOVE RIGHT AWAY.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.561
"WE WERE HOPING
THAT YOU AND MA

17:01.729 --> 17:05.023
"MIGHT BE ABLE TO
HELP US FIGURE OUT
SOMETHING TO DO.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.774
LOVE ALWAYS,
MARY AND ADAM."

17:06.942 --> 17:08.401
THAT'S ABOUT IT
IN A NUTSHELL.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.236
THEY LOSE THEIR BUILDING.
IF THEY DON'T FIND
ANOTHER ONE,

17:10.404 --> 17:12.321
THEY'RE JUST GOING
TO HAVE TO QUIT.

17:12.489 --> 17:13.823
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

17:13.991 --> 17:16.367
Caroline:
IT'S MR. STANDISH
WHO'S TERRIBLE.

17:16.535 --> 17:19.829
IT SOUNDS LIKE
THAT LOWDOWN
ORNERY SKUNK.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.164
SORRY, REVEREND.

17:21.331 --> 17:23.291
I GUESS MAYBE
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
NAME-CALLING,

17:23.459 --> 17:26.335
BUT YOU AIN'T
NEVER MET
MR. STANDISH.

17:26.503 --> 17:28.838
NO, I HAVEN'T.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.256
WHAT I'VE HEARD
ABOUT MR. STANDISH,

17:30.424 --> 17:34.343
YOU MAY BE DOING
AN INJUSTICE...
TO THE SKUNK.

17:34.511 --> 17:36.721
[LAUGHTER]

17:40.184 --> 17:44.562
IF ONLY WE COULD FIND
A PLACE FOR THEM...
SOMEWHERE.

17:46.190 --> 17:48.149
PERHAPS THERE
IS A PLACE.

17:49.735 --> 17:50.818
WHERE?

17:50.986 --> 17:52.028
HERE.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.072
Jonathan: HERE?

17:54.239 --> 17:57.158
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT THAT BIG HOUSE
MR. HANSON LEFT.

17:57.326 --> 17:58.117
NOW, IT NEEDS WORK--

17:58.285 --> 17:59.744
OH, NOW, HOLD
ON, REVEREND.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.080
MARY SAID IN HER
LETTER THAT THEY
DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

18:02.247 --> 18:04.707
THERE'S JUST NO WAY
THEY COULD AFFORD TO
BUY A PLACE LIKE THAT.

18:04.875 --> 18:08.169
I DIDN'T SAY BUY IT.
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO SELL IT,

18:08.337 --> 18:12.882
IT'S TOO BIG FOR A FAMILY,
BUT IT'S NOT TOO BIG
FOR A BLIND SCHOOL.

18:13.050 --> 18:15.802
AND IT'S NOT TOO
RUN DOWN IT COULDN'T
BE FIXED UP.

18:15.969 --> 18:17.595
OF COURSE NOT.
WE ALMOST HAD
TO REBUILD

18:17.763 --> 18:19.889
THIS WHOLE TOWN
WHEN WE CAME BACK.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.558
BUT IT BELONGS
TO THE CHURCH.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.352
WE'RE PART OF
THE CHURCH, AREN'T WE?

18:24.520 --> 18:27.522
OH, REVEREND,
CHARLES,

18:27.689 --> 18:30.983
IT'D BE LIKE
A DREAM COME TRUE.

18:31.151 --> 18:32.944
I SUGGEST
WE STOP DREAMING
AND START DOING.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.905
WE'LL BRING IT UP TO
THE CONGREGATION TOMORROW.

18:41.662 --> 18:45.414
THE TEXT I HAVE CHOSEN
FOR TODAY'S SERVICE SEEMS
PARTICULARLY APPROPRIATE,

18:45.582 --> 18:49.168
AS I TRUST WILL
SOON BECOME CLEAR
TO ALL OF YOU.

18:49.336 --> 18:53.673
IT'S FROM JOHN 10:14.
"I AM THE GOOD SHEPHERD

18:53.841 --> 18:58.594
AND KNOW MY SHEEP,
AND AM KNOWN OF MINE."

18:58.762 --> 19:02.014
FIRST, IT'S MY HAPPY DUTY
TO WELCOME A NEW MEMBER
TO OUR FLOCK,

19:02.182 --> 19:06.102
MR. JOSEPH KAGAN.
JOSEPH.

19:06.270 --> 19:10.940
AND NOW CHARLES INGALLS
HAS SOMETHING TO SAY OF
GREAT IMPORTANCE TO US.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.441
CHARLES.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.736
THANK YOU, REVEREND.

19:16.780 --> 19:18.614
THE WINOKA SCHOOL
FOR THE BLIND,

19:18.782 --> 19:23.286
WHERE MY DAUGHTER
AND HER HUSBAND TEACH,
IS IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.

19:23.453 --> 19:25.037
THEY'VE BEEN NOTIFIED
THAT THEY HAVE TO VACATE

19:25.205 --> 19:27.331
THE BUILDING
WITHIN THE MONTH,

19:27.499 --> 19:31.794
AND THEY HAVE NO PLACE
TO GO AND NO MONEY.

19:31.962 --> 19:36.465
THEY REALLY HAVE
NO RESOURCES AT
ALL TO SPEAK OF.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.634
THE REVEREND WILL TELL
YOU THE REST. THANK YOU.

19:38.802 --> 19:40.469
Reverend:
THANK YOU, CHARLES.

19:40.637 --> 19:44.015
NOW, I WANTED CHARLES
TO MAKE CLEAR PRECISELY
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS

19:44.183 --> 19:45.766
BECAUSE I THINK WE
HERE IN WALNUT GROVE

19:45.934 --> 19:50.688
MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE
AN ANSWER, A WAY TO
HELP THOSE CHILDREN.

19:50.856 --> 19:53.608
NOW, FOR ONE THING,
I REFER TO THE HOUSE

19:53.775 --> 19:58.821
THAT THE LATE AND
MUCH LOVED LARS HANSON
WILLED TO MY CHARGE

19:58.989 --> 20:02.408
TO BE SOLD, AND THE
RECEIPTS TO BE USED FOR
THE BENEFIT OF THE CHURCH,

20:02.576 --> 20:05.453
AND AS YOU KNOW,
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO SELL THE HOUSE,

20:05.621 --> 20:09.457
AND THERE'S NO
FORESEEABLE SALE
IN THE NEAR FUTURE,

20:09.625 --> 20:11.000
BUT I THINK
MR. HANSON'S HOUSE

20:11.168 --> 20:15.504
MIGHT PROVE OF
VALUE TO THE CHURCH
IN ANOTHER WAY.

20:15.672 --> 20:18.507
DO YOU REMEMBER THOSE
WORDS IN MATTHEW?

20:18.675 --> 20:21.219
"I WAS HUNGRY,
AND YOU GAVE ME MEAT.

20:21.386 --> 20:24.180
"I WAS THIRSTY,
AND YOU GAVE ME DRINK.

20:24.348 --> 20:28.184
I WAS A STRANGER,
AND YOU TOOK ME IN."

20:28.352 --> 20:30.144
AND THEN LATER ON,

20:30.312 --> 20:31.520
"FOR AS MUCH
AS YOU HAVE DONE IT

20:31.688 --> 20:34.315
"UNTO ONE OF THE LEAST
OF THESE, MY BRETHREN,

20:34.483 --> 20:36.776
"YOU HAVE DONE IT UNTO ME."

20:38.237 --> 20:42.657
I PROPOSE TO DONATE
MR. HANSON'S HOUSE
TO THE BLIND SCHOOL.

20:42.824 --> 20:45.493
Alden: NOW, YOU KNOW,
UNDER THE TERM OF
MR. HANSON'S WILL,

20:45.661 --> 20:49.455
IT WAS LEFT ENTIRELY TO
MY DISCRETION ABOUT HOW
TO DISPOSE OF THE HOUSE,

20:49.623 --> 20:52.541
BUT I DON'T WANT IT TO
BE A PERSONAL CHOICE.

20:52.709 --> 20:57.213
I WANT IT TO BE ONE
IN WHICH THE WHOLE
FLOCK JOINS,

20:57.381 --> 21:02.093
AND THAT'S WHY I ASK YOU
FOR A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE
IN MY SUGGESTION.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.970
NOW, ALL IN FAVOR, AYE.

21:04.137 --> 21:05.221
AYE.

21:05.389 --> 21:07.890
OPPOSED, NAY.

21:08.058 --> 21:10.476
- REVEREND.
- YES, MR. KAGAN.

21:11.812 --> 21:14.397
AS I RECOLLECT,
THE LORD ALSO SAID,

21:14.564 --> 21:17.692
"FEED MY SHEEP
AND FEED MY LAMBS."

21:17.859 --> 21:19.235
THAT'S RIGHT.

21:19.403 --> 21:24.031
WELL, THESE LAMBS
COMING IN ARE GOING
TO NEED FOOD STUFFS,

21:24.199 --> 21:26.117
AND A WAY
TO KEEP ON EATING,

21:26.285 --> 21:27.952
SO I'M STARTING
THE BALL ROLLING

21:28.120 --> 21:32.081
BY DONATING
GERTRUDE, ONE OF
MY PRIME BROOD SOWS.

21:32.249 --> 21:33.249
THANK YOU,
MR. KAGAN.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.709
AND I'M GIVING
A MILKING COW.

21:34.876 --> 21:36.002
Man: I'LL GIVE
7 BAGS OF WHEAT.

21:36.169 --> 21:38.129
I'LL DONATE
5 BUSHELS
OF CORN.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.463
REVEREND ALDEN,
IT SEEMS TO ME

21:39.631 --> 21:42.591
THAT EVERYBODY HAS IGNORED
THE REAL PROBLEM HERE.

21:42.759 --> 21:46.470
NOW, THAT HOUSE
IS IN A STATE
OF DISREPAIR.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.931
Harriet:
WHY, NOBODY COULD
POSSIBLY LIVE IN IT.

21:49.099 --> 21:50.141
THAT'S
VERY TRUE--

21:50.309 --> 21:52.101
NOW, I AM
PERSONALLY WILLING

21:52.269 --> 21:57.106
TO DONATE ALL THE MATERIALS
REQUIRED: THE SHINGLES,
THE PAINT, THE LUMBER,

21:57.274 --> 22:00.109
EVERYTHING RIGHT DOWN
TO THE LAST NAIL.

22:00.277 --> 22:02.695
THAT'S VERY GENEROUS,
MRS. OLESON.

22:02.863 --> 22:06.032
Harriet: I KNOW,
BUT IT'S THE LEAST
THAT I COULD DO

22:06.199 --> 22:09.368
FOR THE LITTLE SHEEP
OF HIS FLOCK.

22:09.536 --> 22:14.290
OH, YES,
AND I WILL ALSO DONATE
THE PLAQUE, OF COURSE.

22:16.251 --> 22:17.293
THE PLAQUE?

22:17.461 --> 22:21.297
YES. WELL, IT'LL BE JUST
A LITTLE ONE TO MARK

22:21.465 --> 22:27.261
THE HARRIET OLESON INSTITUTE
FOR THE ADVANCEMENT
OF BLIND CHILDREN.

22:30.307 --> 22:33.434
MRS. OLESON,
THAT'S REALLY
TOO MUCH.

22:34.978 --> 22:36.437
I KNOW IT IS.

23:06.426 --> 23:11.097
MARY, ADAM,
TELEGRAPH FOR YOU
FROM WALNUT GROVE.

23:11.264 --> 23:13.099
READ IT,
PLEASE.

23:18.730 --> 23:24.568
"WALNUT GROVE HAS
ADOPTED YOUR CHILDREN
AND YOUR SCHOOL,

23:24.736 --> 23:28.531
"DONATING BUILDING
AND SUPPLIES.

23:28.698 --> 23:32.034
"WILL COME
TO TRANSPORT.

23:32.202 --> 23:36.205
LETTER FOLLOWING.
LOVE, PA."

23:36.373 --> 23:39.125
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

23:40.460 --> 23:44.505
THANK GOD. EVERYTHING'S
GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

23:58.603 --> 24:00.729
WELL, ISN'T THAT
WONDERFUL NEWS?

24:00.897 --> 24:04.066
THE BEST. I'M VERY
HAPPY FOR YOU.

24:04.234 --> 24:06.902
FOR US.
IT'S YOUR SCHOOL.

24:07.070 --> 24:09.989
NOT ANYMORE, ADAM.
THAT'S WHAT I
WANTED TO TELL YOU.

24:10.157 --> 24:12.491
IT'S YOURS NOW.

24:12.659 --> 24:14.577
MINE?

24:14.744 --> 24:15.953
WELL, IT CAN'T BE.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.497
YOU'RE THE HEART
AND SOUL OF
THIS SCHOOL.

24:18.665 --> 24:19.874
THANK YOU FOR
SAYING SO, ADAM,

24:20.041 --> 24:22.918
BUT YOU AND MARY
ARE NOW.

24:23.086 --> 24:24.462
OH, HOWEVER, YOU
CAN REST ASSURED

24:24.629 --> 24:26.672
MY HEART AND SOUL
WILL ALWAYS BE
WITH YOU

24:26.840 --> 24:29.133
AND THE SCHOOL,
WHEREVER YOU ARE,

24:29.301 --> 24:32.219
BUT AS YOU KNOW, MY
HEALTH HASN'T BEEN
THE BEST OF LATE.

24:32.387 --> 24:33.429
THE TRUTH
OF THE MATTER IS,

24:33.597 --> 24:35.139
I'M MUCH SICKER
THAN I'VE LET ON.

24:35.307 --> 24:39.435
I DIDN'T WANT
TO WORRY ANYONE.

24:39.603 --> 24:42.813
NO, YOU'VE JUST
BEEN DOING TOO
MUCH, THAT'S ALL.

24:42.981 --> 24:44.190
A LITTLE REST,
YOU'LL GET--

24:44.357 --> 24:48.277
NO, ADAM.
I'VE EVEN SEEN
A SPECIALIST.

24:48.445 --> 24:51.489
I'M NOT GOING
TO GET BETTER,
ONLY WORSE.

24:51.656 --> 24:55.784
Mr. Ames: SO, YOU SEE,
I CAN'T COME TO WALNUT
GROVE WITH YOU.

24:55.952 --> 25:00.289
THE BURDEN
OF CONTINUITY
MUST FALL ON YOU

25:00.457 --> 25:02.458
IF THE SCHOOL
IS TO CONTINUE.

25:05.504 --> 25:10.299
I'M NOT SURE
I'M THE MAN, MR. AMES.

25:10.467 --> 25:14.470
I'M NOT SURE I CAN
FILL YOU SHOES,

25:14.638 --> 25:16.597
AND DO THE JOB
THAT YOU DID.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.265
WELL, I AM,
VERY SURE,

25:18.433 --> 25:22.853
I KNOW THAT I'M GOING TO
BE VERY, VERY PROUD OF YOU.

25:23.021 --> 25:26.065
AND NOW, SPEAKING OF REST,

25:26.233 --> 25:29.401
I THINK I WILL
LIE DOWN FOR A WHILE.

25:32.322 --> 25:34.990
- MR. AMES.
- YES, ADAM?

25:37.410 --> 25:39.286
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

25:39.454 --> 25:42.581
HOW MUCH I RESPECT,

25:42.749 --> 25:45.334
HOW DEEPLY I VALUE,

25:45.502 --> 25:48.295
WHAT YOU'VE DONE HERE.

25:48.463 --> 25:51.590
FOR ME AND FOR ALL OF US.

25:53.718 --> 25:57.137
I VALUE YOU,
TOO, ADAM.

25:57.305 --> 25:59.807
I VALUE YOU ALL.

25:59.975 --> 26:05.521
MORE THAN I CAN
POSSIBLY PUT
INTO WORDS.

26:05.689 --> 26:09.191
I FEEL LIKE I'M
LOSING MY MENTOR...

26:11.361 --> 26:14.655
A VERY DEAR FRIEND.

26:14.823 --> 26:17.616
ALMOST A FATHER.

26:19.786 --> 26:21.996
AND YOU...

26:22.163 --> 26:25.374
YOU, ADAM...

26:25.542 --> 26:29.962
YOU'RE THE SON
I NEVER HAD.

27:18.803 --> 27:20.971
Caroline: CHARLES,
ANOTHER LETTER FROM MARY.

27:21.139 --> 27:22.681
IS EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT?

27:22.849 --> 27:27.186
OH, YES. THEY'RE
JOINING UP WITH ANOTHER
SCHOOL FROM ST. LOUIS,

27:27.354 --> 27:28.562
MEETING THEM
AT BUTLER.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.648
ANOTHER SCHOOL?

27:30.815 --> 27:33.317
ONLY A FEW
MORE STUDENTS,
MRS. OLESON.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.735
OH, RUN BY MRS.
TERHUNE, HUH?

27:34.903 --> 27:37.655
- MM-HMM.
- MRS. TERHUNE?

27:37.822 --> 27:40.240
AH, YES,
A HESTER-SUE TERHUNE.

27:40.408 --> 27:43.202
OH, GOOD GRACIOUS!

27:43.370 --> 27:46.038
A ST. LOUIS TERHUNE!

27:46.206 --> 27:47.623
IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO BE
SOMETHING SPECIAL?

27:47.791 --> 27:50.125
Harriet:
SOMETHING SPECIAL?
WELL, I SHOULD SAY.

27:50.293 --> 27:54.254
IT'S ONLY THE VERY
TOP OF THE SOCIAL
LADDER IN ST. LOUIS.

27:54.422 --> 27:56.006
OF COURSE, MY FAMILY
WAS ON AN UPPER RUNG,

27:56.174 --> 28:01.095
BUT THE TERHUNES WERE
THE CREME DE LA CREME,
AND EVER SO RICH.

28:01.262 --> 28:02.930
I HAVE A
FEELING YOU'VE GOT
THE WRONG TERHUNE,

28:03.098 --> 28:05.849
OTHERWISE, WHY WOULD
SHE COME ALL THE WAY OUT
HERE TO GET FREE RENT?

28:06.017 --> 28:10.896
WELL, WE
ARISTOCRATS ARE OFTEN
A LITTLE ECCENTRIC.

28:11.064 --> 28:12.981
OH, YOU MEAN CHEAP.

28:13.149 --> 28:14.858
I MEAN ECCENTRIC.

28:15.026 --> 28:17.569
[CHUCKLES]
I CAN'T WAIT
TO TELL NELS.

28:17.737 --> 28:20.406
HE'LL BE SO THRILLED
ABOUT THE TERHUNES.

28:22.158 --> 28:24.535
I SEE ADAM'S
GOT ANOTHER
WAGON AND TEAM.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.287
I GUESS WE'RE
GOING TO NEED
ANOTHER DRIVER.

28:27.455 --> 28:29.373
I'LL CHECK WITH JOE
KAGAN, MAYBE HE'LL
GIVE ME A HAND.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.041
Caroline: OKAY,
SEE YOU LATER.

28:31.209 --> 28:32.876
Dr. Baker: CAROLINE,
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME
WITH THAT PAINT.

28:33.044 --> 28:35.629
COME ON.
I WANT YOU TO SEE
WHAT WE'VE DONE.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.426
JOE, I WONDER
IF I COULD ASK
A FAVOR OF YOU.

28:40.593 --> 28:42.219
WELL,
ASK AWAY.

28:42.387 --> 28:45.013
I JUST GOT A LETTER
FROM ADAM, HE'S GOT
ANOTHER WAGON AND TEAM.

28:45.181 --> 28:47.141
THAT MEANS WE'RE GOING
TO NEED ANOTHER DRIVER.

28:47.308 --> 28:48.809
I KNOW IT'S A LONG TRIP
TO WINOKA AND BACK,

28:48.977 --> 28:50.102
BUT I WAS JUST
WONDERING IF--

28:50.270 --> 28:52.354
WHEN DO WE LEAVE?

28:52.522 --> 28:54.857
TOMORROW MORNING
FIRST LIGHT.
I APPRECIATE IT!

28:55.024 --> 28:56.150
I'LL PICK YOU UP
AT YOUR PLACE.

28:56.317 --> 28:57.484
RIGHT.

28:57.652 --> 29:01.655
MR. KAGAN, WHY
ARE YOU SITTING
AROUND RELAXING

29:01.823 --> 29:04.283
WHILE THE REST OF
US ARE PULLING
OUR WEIGHT,

29:04.451 --> 29:07.578
TRYING TO HELP THE
POOR LITTLE SHEEP
OF HIS FLOCK?

29:07.746 --> 29:11.206
NOW, IF YOU WANT
TO BE A MEMBER
OF OUR CHURCH--

29:11.374 --> 29:13.500
[MUFFLED TALK]

29:27.140 --> 29:29.641
A ST. LOUIS TERHUNE.

29:31.478 --> 29:32.603
NELS.

29:32.771 --> 29:33.729
YEAH?

29:33.897 --> 29:36.899
I'VE COME TO TWO
IMPORTANT DECISIONS.

29:41.196 --> 29:43.906
I AM GOING TO TAKE
THE STAGE TO WINOKA,

29:44.073 --> 29:47.326
AND I'M GOING TO
TRAVEL BACK WITH
THE BLIND SCHOOL.

29:47.494 --> 29:49.870
WHY?

29:50.038 --> 29:52.915
FOR HEAVEN'S
SAKES, IT'S MY
SCHOOL, ISN'T IT?

29:53.082 --> 29:56.543
[CHUCKLES]
BESIDES, I CAN
HARDLY WAIT

29:56.711 --> 30:00.714
TO MEET MY FELLOW
PHILANTHROPIST,
MRS. TERHUNE.

30:00.882 --> 30:03.342
[LAUGHS]

30:06.638 --> 30:08.889
SO, I'M GOING TO TAKE
THE SATURDAY STAGE

30:09.057 --> 30:11.767
AND STOP OFF
IN BROOKINGS
FOR A FEW DAYS.

30:11.935 --> 30:13.143
WHY?

30:13.311 --> 30:16.814
WELL, BECAUSE I
WANT TO BUY A FEW
NEW STYLISH THINGS.

30:16.981 --> 30:21.109
AFTER ALL, I CAN'T MEET
MRS. TERHUNE LOOKING LIKE
A FRUMP, NOW, CAN I?

30:21.277 --> 30:23.445
MOVE OVER TO
YOUR OWN SIDE.

30:27.408 --> 30:32.246
ALSO, I'VE DECIDED THAT
I'M GOING TO REDECORATE

30:32.413 --> 30:33.997
MRS. TERHUNE'S
BEDROOM.

30:34.165 --> 30:38.502
AFTER ALL, A WOMAN
OF HER BREEDING NEEDS
A CHARMING BEDROOM...

30:40.129 --> 30:41.713
SO I'M GIVING
HER OURS.

30:41.881 --> 30:42.798
WHAT?

30:42.966 --> 30:45.843
WELL, I WANTED TO
REDECORATE, ANYWAY.

30:46.010 --> 30:47.010
WE JUST
BOUGHT IT!

30:47.178 --> 30:49.513
WELL, I KNOW,
BUT I NEVER
LIKED IT.

30:49.681 --> 30:52.683
SO THEY'RE PICKING
UP THE FURNITURE
ON SUNDAY,

30:52.851 --> 30:54.142
THE DAY AFTER
I LEAVE.

30:54.310 --> 30:56.979
WHERE AM I
GOING TO SLEEP?

30:57.146 --> 30:59.106
ON THE COUCH,
IN THE PARLOR.

30:59.274 --> 31:02.776
NOW, IT'S JUST UNTIL
THE NEW FURNITURE
I ORDERED ARRIVES.

31:02.944 --> 31:04.152
WHEN IS THAT?

31:04.320 --> 31:08.073
WELL...IT SHOULD
BE HERE BY THE
TIME I GET BACK.

31:08.241 --> 31:10.200
THAT FIGURES.

31:12.495 --> 31:15.080
OH...
[CHUCKLES]

31:20.628 --> 31:22.212
YOU'RE GOING
TO MISS ME?

31:22.380 --> 31:23.964
LIKE A CRUTCH.

31:24.132 --> 31:26.008
WHAT DID YOU
SAY, DARLING?

31:26.175 --> 31:27.759
VERY MUCH.

31:27.927 --> 31:29.595
[LAUGHS]

32:35.912 --> 32:37.788
WELL, I
THINK THIS IS
THE LAST OF IT.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.915
GOOD.

32:43.211 --> 32:46.088
EXCUSE ME, ARE MR.
AND MRS. KENDALL
RECEIVING TODAY?

32:46.255 --> 32:47.214
PA!

32:47.382 --> 32:50.133
- ADAM. MARY.
- HELLO.

32:50.301 --> 32:52.219
Charles: OH, HOW
ARE YOU, DARLING?

32:52.387 --> 32:54.096
YOU LOOK GREAT.
HEY, THE BOTH
OF YOU.

32:54.263 --> 32:56.390
OH, I'M SO HAPPY
YOU'RE HERE.

32:56.557 --> 32:58.308
HAPPY AND IN
YOUR DEBT, SIR.

32:58.476 --> 32:59.768
OH, NEVER MIND
THAT DEBT BUSINESS.

32:59.936 --> 33:01.603
IT WAS ALL OF
WALNUT GROVE THAT
PITCHED IN TO HELP.

33:01.771 --> 33:03.271
WE'RE IN
THEIR DEBT, TOO.

33:03.439 --> 33:05.107
HEY, I BROUGHT
A FRIEND ALONG. YOU
REMEMBER JOE KAGAN?

33:05.274 --> 33:07.025
OH, JOE!
I CERTAINLY DO.

33:07.193 --> 33:10.237
MARY. PLEASED TO MEET
YOU, ADAM, I HEARD
A LOT ABOUT YOU.

33:10.405 --> 33:11.780
IT'S NICE TO
MEET YOU, JOE.

33:11.948 --> 33:13.448
JOE'S GOING TO DRIVE
THE SECOND WAGON
FOR YOU.

33:13.616 --> 33:14.533
WE APPRECIATE IT.

33:14.701 --> 33:16.159
SO DO I.

33:16.327 --> 33:19.079
THIS DIRT FARMER'S BEEN
PROMOTED FROM SCRATCHING
A NOTHING CROP

33:19.247 --> 33:22.874
TO CHAUFFEURING FOR
AN ACADEMY. YOU'VE
GOT A GOOD STOUT TEAM?

33:23.042 --> 33:25.752
YEAH, THE BEST.
THAT'S IT,
PARKED OUTSIDE.

33:25.920 --> 33:28.130
I'LL TAKE A LOOK
AT THE TEAM, I'LL
BE RIDING BEHIND.

33:28.297 --> 33:29.715
I'LL VISIT
FOR A WHILE.

33:29.882 --> 33:33.010
OH, I CAN'T WAIT
TILL YOU'RE HOME.

33:58.619 --> 34:00.495
IF YOU'RE ALL SET,
WE CAN LEAVE FIRST
THING IN THE MORNING.

34:00.663 --> 34:01.913
ALL RIGHT.

34:02.081 --> 34:05.625
Joe: CHARLES, YOU
GOT A SECOND TO
LOOK AT SOMETHING?

34:05.793 --> 34:07.335
SURE, WHAT IS IT?

34:07.503 --> 34:10.172
I DON'T KNOW WHAT.
HORSES, I THINK.

34:19.140 --> 34:20.223
THAT'S IT?

34:20.391 --> 34:22.142
THAT'S RIGHT.

34:31.861 --> 34:35.322
ADAM, THERE'S TWO
THINGS THE BLIND SHOULD
APPROACH WITH CAUTION:

34:35.490 --> 34:37.824
BUZZ SAWS AND
BUYING HORSES.

34:37.992 --> 34:39.326
WHAT'S WRONG WITH
THE HORSES, JOE?

34:39.494 --> 34:41.161
DON'T KNOW WHERE
TO BEGIN, MARY.

34:41.329 --> 34:42.621
THEY WOULDN'T
MAKE GLUE.

34:42.789 --> 34:44.289
IF THEY DID, IT
WOULDN'T STICK.

34:44.457 --> 34:46.333
WE WOULDN'T GET
TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF
TOWN WITH THAT TEAM.

34:46.501 --> 34:50.045
YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL
ME ONLY A BLIND MAN
WOULD BUY THOSE HORSES?

34:50.213 --> 34:52.339
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TRYING TO
TELL YOU.

34:52.507 --> 34:56.051
HOW'D YOU EVER COME
ACROSS THIS PAIR OF
SPAVIN BEAUTIES?

34:56.219 --> 34:59.554
I TRADED
THE SCHOOL'S
FURNISHINGS FOR THEM

34:59.722 --> 35:01.389
WITH MR. STANDISH.

35:01.557 --> 35:06.186
Adam: THEM, THE WAGON,
AND FOOD SUPPLIES
FOR THE TRIP,

35:06.354 --> 35:08.897
AND HE SAID
THEY WERE THE FINEST
TEAM IN HIS LIVERY,

35:09.065 --> 35:11.233
AND I GOT THAT
IN WRITING.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.568
WE STILL
GOT TAKEN.

35:13.736 --> 35:16.238
WHAT ARE
WE GOING
TO DO NOW?

35:16.405 --> 35:18.115
MARY, YOU
AND ADAM
STAY HERE.

35:18.282 --> 35:20.450
THE FOUR OF US
ARE GOING TO GO
SEE MR. STANDISH.

WE DON'T SERVE
HORSES IN HERE,
INGALLS.

35:43.391 --> 35:45.267
THEN YOU MUST HAVE
CHANGED YOUR MENU.
WHERE'S STANDISH?

35:45.434 --> 35:47.102
Standish: WHAT
ARE THOSE HORSES
DOING DOWN THERE?

35:47.270 --> 35:49.938

35:52.608 --> 35:54.442
THAT'S RIGHT.

OUT OF HERE.

THAT THEY'RE YOUR
NAGS, MR. STANDISH.

OF MINE.

THOSE ARE NOT MY HORSES
ANYMORE, INGALLS.

GOING TO BE A
VERY HARD TRIP.

39:18.606 --> 39:19.522
I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD GO.

39:19.690 --> 39:20.982
WELL, WHY NOT?

39:21.150 --> 39:22.609
WHY, IT'S GOING
TO BE A ROUGH
TRIP, REALLY.

39:22.777 --> 39:25.945
WELL, NONSENSE!
IF THE CHILDREN
CAN DO IT, SO CAN I.

39:26.113 --> 39:28.531
NOW, YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO TALK ME OUT OF IT,
CHARLES INGALLS.

39:28.699 --> 39:29.657
YOU'RE SURE?

39:29.825 --> 39:32.369
MR. INGALLS,
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

39:34.330 --> 39:35.705
[CLEARS THROAT]
SUIT YOURSELF.

39:35.873 --> 39:38.416
YOU RIDE UP ON THE
WAGON SEAT THERE
WITH MR. KAGAN.

39:42.588 --> 39:48.176
MR. INGALLS,
I PREFER NOT TO
RIDE IN THAT WAGON.

39:48.344 --> 39:49.344
WELL, WHY NOT?

39:49.512 --> 39:51.846
WELL, YOU CERTAINLY
DON'T EXPECT ME

39:52.014 --> 39:54.349
TO RIDE ALL THE WAY
TO WALNUT GROVE

39:54.517 --> 39:56.101
WITH A COLORED
PERSON, DO YOU?

39:56.268 --> 39:58.019
MRS. OLESON, I
DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO DO ANYTHING.

39:58.187 --> 40:00.188
NOW, YOU CAN EITHER
RIDE ON THE WAGON
SEAT WITH MR. KAGAN,

40:00.356 --> 40:02.732
OR YOU CAN WALK.
YOU SUIT YOURSELF.

40:07.863 --> 40:09.864
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL WALK.

40:10.032 --> 40:11.616
FINE.

40:11.784 --> 40:14.202
Charles: JOE, YOU'VE
GOT ROOM FOR KIM UP IN
THE SEAT OF YOUR WAGON.

40:14.370 --> 40:15.912
ALL RIGHT.

40:33.639 --> 40:35.723
GOOD-BYE, MARY.

40:35.891 --> 40:37.934
GOOD-BYE, SIR.

40:42.898 --> 40:44.816
GOOD-BYE, MY SON.

40:51.657 --> 40:53.158
GOOD-BYE, SIR.

40:57.079 --> 40:59.497
GOD BLESS
YOU ALL.

42:21.205 --> 42:22.914
AAH!

42:24.208 --> 42:26.292
OH!

42:29.547 --> 42:31.881

42:32.049 --> 42:34.801
Joe: [LAUGHING]

42:40.516 --> 42:42.308
IMPUDENT.

43:02.204 --> 43:04.289
Charles: MRS. OLESON,
WOULD YOU LIKE A SANDWICH?
CHEESE AND MEAT.

43:04.456 --> 43:06.040

SANDWICHES OVER THERE?

43:34.403 --> 43:35.737
NO.
NO, THANK YOU.

43:35.904 --> 43:36.904
SUIT YOURSELF.

43:37.072 --> 43:39.824
I'M NOT THE LEAST
BIT HUNGRY.

43:39.992 --> 43:41.743
OH. YES.

GOOD HEAVENS.

43:43.203 --> 43:45.830
OH! WHAT ARE

43:54.506 --> 43:56.633
IT'S GOING TO
BE A LONG WALK,
MRS. OLESON.

43:56.800 --> 43:59.761
YOU'D BETTER KEEP
BOTH FEET FLAT
ON THE GROUND.

44:08.604 --> 44:10.146
IDIOT.

44:33.629 --> 44:35.213
Charles:

44:39.176 --> 44:41.302
Adam:
IS IT VERY DEEP?

44:41.470 --> 44:43.971
NO. IT'S JUST RIGHT.
YOU'LL LOVE IT.

45:14.670 --> 45:16.504
EVERYBODY SET

45:16.672 --> 45:17.839
All: YEAH!

45:18.006 --> 45:20.383
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO WADING.

46:08.807 --> 46:10.391
AAH!

46:10.559 --> 46:14.061
UNLESS YOU CAN WALK ON
IT, MRS. OLESON, YOU GOT

46:14.229 --> 46:16.063
OH! FOR HEAVEN'S
SAKE! OH!

46:53.602 --> 46:54.727
OH! LOOK AT ME!

46:54.895 --> 46:57.063
I'M ALL
SOAKING WET.

46:57.231 --> 46:59.816
WELL, YOU'VE GOT
PLENTY OF TIME
TO DRY OFF.

46:59.983 --> 47:01.734
WE'LL MAKE CAMP
HERE TONIGHT.

47:01.902 --> 47:03.778
WE'LL GET TO

47:03.946 --> 47:05.446

47:15.791 --> 47:18.793
I NEVER HAD
ANYTHING LIKE

47:18.961 --> 47:20.419
ARE THERE ANY
MORE RIVERS
UP AHEAD?

47:20.587 --> 47:22.630
YEAH, THERE'S
ONE, BUT IT'S
RUNNING SLOW.

47:22.798 --> 47:24.924
Charles:
IT'S THIS DRY SPELL.
WATER'S DOWN EVERYWHERE.

47:25.092 --> 47:27.260
GOOD. IT'LL BE EASIER
ON THE CHILDREN.

47:27.427 --> 47:30.972
ALL RIGHT. COME ON, KIDS.
GET YOUR SHOES ON.
WE'LL MAKE CAMP.
