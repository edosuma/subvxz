02:08.161 --> 02:09.961
the most dangerous warlord
on The Triple Frontier,

02:10.029 --> 02:11.296
which is saying something,

02:11.364 --> 02:13.365
and that you did it alone.

02:13.433 --> 02:16.068
- Yes.
- Help me out here

02:16.135 --> 02:17.669
'cause when we discussed this
the other day,

02:17.737 --> 02:18.970
I explained to you
that no one knows

02:19.038 --> 02:19.971
where to find Cervantes.

02:20.039 --> 02:21.340
Yes.

02:21.407 --> 02:24.376
And that they kill people
down there for even asking.

02:25.645 --> 02:28.580
You're worried about me.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.649

02:37.190 --> 02:39.224
It's been almost five days
since Susan went missing

02:39.275 --> 02:40.926
investigating a story
about Cervantes.

02:40.993 --> 02:42.227
And we all agree
that if Cervantes

02:42.295 --> 02:44.162
simply wanted her dead,
he would've done it publicly.

02:44.230 --> 02:45.997
- So she's probably still alive.
- Probably.

02:46.065 --> 02:47.766
The State Department can't act
because they have no way

02:47.834 --> 02:49.301
of getting a message
to him.

02:49.369 --> 02:51.737
The local governments won't act
because they're afraid of him.

02:51.804 --> 02:53.238
And when I asked you
about rescue options,

02:53.306 --> 02:54.623
you said there weren't any.

02:54.707 --> 02:56.174
Well, I meant
that I couldn't think of any.

02:56.242 --> 02:57.175
Well,
what's the difference?

02:57.243 --> 02:58.176
In the interim,

02:58.244 --> 03:00.645
I may have thought of one.

03:03.216 --> 03:05.083
Well, what is it?

03:05.151 --> 03:06.651
I've known this woman
since we were children.

03:06.719 --> 03:08.753
Well, it's a little
unorthodox.

03:08.805 --> 03:11.423
You might not like it.
But could be worth a try.

03:11.474 --> 03:12.441
<i>No.</i>

03:12.525 --> 03:14.025
No.

03:14.093 --> 03:15.127
Hell, no.

- Oh, you got my note.
- <i>Yeah, I got your note.</i>

03:17.830 --> 03:21.500
Bad idea.
Terrible idea.

03:21.567 --> 03:23.535
- I won't be a part of it.
- Won't be a part of what?

03:26.172 --> 03:27.873
All right, let's just start
at the beginning.

03:27.940 --> 03:29.107
A few years ago,

03:29.175 --> 03:31.143
Miguel Cervantes
hired an assassin to take out

03:31.210 --> 03:33.345
<i>the President of Paraguay.</i>

03:33.413 --> 03:34.446
The assassin was successful.

03:34.514 --> 03:36.314
Was quite proud of himself,
I might add.

03:36.382 --> 03:37.883
We're talking about you.

03:37.950 --> 03:40.852
No. Wasn't me.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.020
<i>It was a guy I know.</i>

03:42.088 --> 03:44.923
Anyway, Cervantes
and this assassin

03:44.991 --> 03:46.658
had a falling out.

03:46.726 --> 03:47.659
Define falling out.

03:47.727 --> 03:48.793
Cervantes tried to kill him.

03:48.845 --> 03:50.028
<i>Which means</i>

03:50.096 --> 03:52.130
that the assassin

03:52.198 --> 03:54.032
might be inclined
to help us stage a rescue.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.333
<i>Dude.</i>

03:55.401 --> 03:57.736
No. I mean, seriously.

03:58.684 --> 03:59.504
<i>This guy's a bad egg.</i>

03:59.604 --> 04:01.872
- You can't trust him.
- Really?

04:01.940 --> 04:03.874
You see
what's happening here?

04:03.942 --> 04:05.409
<i>We</i> agree.

04:05.477 --> 04:07.511
Now imagine
how that makes me feel.

04:07.579 --> 04:09.346
You think I'm happy
about this?

04:09.414 --> 04:10.648
I didn't want
to see him again

04:10.715 --> 04:11.715
let alone ask him for help.

04:11.783 --> 04:12.716
But the lady

04:12.784 --> 04:14.485
wants to get
her friend back

04:14.552 --> 04:16.019
so I don't have
any better ideas.

04:16.087 --> 04:17.588
Do you?
<i>Will someone please tell me</i>

04:17.656 --> 04:18.755
what's going on here?

04:18.822 --> 04:20.057
<i>Who is this guy</i>

04:20.125 --> 04:21.725
and why is it such a big deal
to ask for his help?

04:21.793 --> 04:22.760
He was picked up
by the FBI

04:22.827 --> 04:24.528
then he was traded
to the Russians.

04:24.596 --> 04:30.017
Apparently they wanted him
more than our guys did.

04:30.101 --> 04:31.869
He's not gonna be easy
to get to,

04:31.936 --> 04:34.505
but I just don't see
any other way.

04:41.680 --> 04:43.113
<i>Spasiba.</i>

04:43.181 --> 04:45.616
So the only person
who can help rescue Susan

04:45.684 --> 04:47.017
is a professional killer

04:47.085 --> 04:48.352
you neither like nor trust

04:48.420 --> 04:50.020
who's currently rotting
in a Siberian prison,

04:50.088 --> 04:51.622
and these two think
you're completely crazy

04:51.690 --> 04:52.656
for even suggesting it.

04:52.724 --> 04:53.991
Is that a vaguely
accurate picture

04:54.059 --> 04:56.093
of what we're talking
about here?

04:56.161 --> 04:58.028
Pretty much.

04:59.097 --> 05:00.864
Oh, last time I saw him,

05:00.932 --> 05:01.932
we tried to kill each other.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.701
Look,
I know it sounds bad.

05:03.768 --> 05:05.636
But if we're gonna stage
a rescue for Susan, I think--

05:05.704 --> 05:07.438
Do it.

05:08.773 --> 05:12.009
Whatever it takes.

05:12.060 --> 05:15.346
We have to get Susan
out of there alive.

05:16.715 --> 05:18.482
Just out of curiosity,

05:18.550 --> 05:21.819
can you tell me the name
of this assassin?

05:21.886 --> 05:25.222
Well, he goes by several names.

05:25.290 --> 05:27.057
But the one
I know him by is...

05:27.125 --> 05:29.360
Baptiste.

Well, before Chance

was...Chance,

he and Baptiste worked
for the same boss.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.912
A master assassin
who took them both in

07:25.980 --> 07:27.047

07:27.114 --> 07:28.748
They called him
"the old man."

07:28.816 --> 07:30.350
And in a weird way,

07:30.418 --> 07:32.986
they were the closest thing
Chance had to family.

07:33.054 --> 07:35.222
So why does Chance hate him
so much?

07:35.289 --> 07:37.891
He wanted out
of that life.

07:37.959 --> 07:39.359

transportation
was provided for me.

07:56.344 --> 07:57.277

07:57.345 --> 07:59.246
A gentleman by the name
of Esteban.

I beg your pardon?

09:02.310 --> 09:03.243
The target Cervantes

09:03.311 --> 09:04.811

Heritage Collection.

It's hardware that allows us

09:56.564 --> 09:57.964
At least this way,
wherever they go,

09:58.032 --> 09:59.899
I can watch his back.

09:59.967 --> 10:03.803

of prisoner Baptiste.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.038
Custody?

10:05.106 --> 10:07.040
What makes you think
I would agree to that?

10:07.108 --> 10:09.209
This, my friend,

10:09.276 --> 10:11.277
is a Private Bank of Geneva
Black Card.

10:11.345 --> 10:13.980
Airport club access,
concierge services,

10:14.048 --> 10:15.215
no spending limit.

10:15.282 --> 10:19.552
Compliments

10:21.322 --> 10:23.123
Until then,
knock yourself out.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.692

some ground rules.

11:10.438 --> 11:11.438
Ground rules?

11:11.505 --> 11:12.972
We're at grammar school now,

11:13.040 --> 11:14.741
Rule number one,
cuffs stay on at all times.

11:14.809 --> 11:16.176
You're kidding me.

11:16.243 --> 11:18.111
Rule number two,
you will not touch a weapon

11:18.179 --> 11:19.112
of any kind.

11:19.163 --> 11:20.947
I'm ashamed to know you.
I truly am.

11:21.015 --> 11:21.948
Rule number three.

11:22.016 --> 11:23.283
When this is finished,

11:23.350 --> 11:24.951
you're going straight back
to that prison.

11:25.019 --> 11:27.020
Are we clear?

11:27.088 --> 11:28.288
All except rule number three.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.556
That's non-negotiable.

11:33.494 --> 11:34.527
We'll see.

11:44.772 --> 11:45.705
Who is that?

11:45.773 --> 11:48.141
His name's
Captain Mike Harmen.

11:48.209 --> 11:49.676
He's the contact
of the Defense Department.

11:49.744 --> 11:51.578
<i>I've been on the phone
with him all week</i>

11:51.645 --> 11:53.079
trying to get some help
with Susan.

11:53.147 --> 11:55.248
<i>I'll be right with you,</i>

11:55.316 --> 11:56.883
I'll go with you.

11:56.951 --> 11:58.151
Why?

11:58.219 --> 12:01.187
Highly-illegal
satellite setup.

12:01.255 --> 12:04.224
<i>Chance on ground
with fugitive assassin.</i>

12:04.291 --> 12:07.327
We need to make sure
this goes very carefully.

12:07.394 --> 12:12.499
I once sat a poker table
with Rumsfeld, Kissinger,

12:12.566 --> 12:14.834
and the Chief of Operations
for the Mossad.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.002
So?

12:16.070 --> 12:17.804
Rummy still owes me
1,000 bucks.

12:23.010 --> 12:25.512
So what can I do for you,
Captain?

12:25.579 --> 12:27.747
Mrs. Pucci,
we have a problem.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.849
Look, I get it.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.384
You told me not to go
after Susan Connors

12:31.452 --> 12:32.752
and I went anyway.

12:32.820 --> 12:33.887
Your boss put some heat
on you.

12:33.954 --> 12:34.954
He told you
to come down here

12:35.022 --> 12:36.790
and put some heat on me.

12:36.857 --> 12:40.126
Can't we just save ourselves
some time and go get some lunch?

12:40.194 --> 12:41.628
We certainly could...

12:41.695 --> 12:42.896
Had I not received
this message

12:42.963 --> 12:44.397
just before
I arrived here.

12:44.465 --> 12:45.598
What is that?

12:45.666 --> 12:47.801
That is a photograph
sent by my liaison

12:47.868 --> 12:49.302
in the Paraguayan Army

12:49.370 --> 12:51.304
of your private plane
sitting in an airfield

12:51.372 --> 12:53.740
just a few miles away
from The Triple Frontier.

12:53.808 --> 12:56.242
Oh.

12:56.310 --> 12:57.644
That's the ground.

12:57.711 --> 12:59.679
Why are you disconnecting
the ground wire?

12:59.747 --> 13:01.648
I think we've got
a problem.

13:01.715 --> 13:02.949
What kind of problem?

13:03.017 --> 13:04.784
Captain Mike Harmen has asked
the Paraguayan Army

13:04.852 --> 13:05.852
to seize my plane.

13:07.621 --> 13:11.024
I think Chance just lost
his getaway.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.503
There's a doorway
down there on the right.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.672
That's Esteban's place.

13:25.739 --> 13:27.774
But before we go in,

13:27.842 --> 13:29.425
can I renew my objection
to the current state

13:29.510 --> 13:30.426
of my hands?

13:30.511 --> 13:31.778
- I already told you.
- Yeah, I know.

13:31.846 --> 13:33.179
I know. Rule one.

13:33.247 --> 13:34.848
Thing is, folks around here
don't take kindly

13:34.915 --> 13:36.683
to strangers
asking questions.

13:36.750 --> 13:38.351
What sense does it make
to handicap ourselves

13:38.418 --> 13:39.552
from the outset?

13:39.620 --> 13:41.855
You know what,
you got a point.

13:47.561 --> 13:51.698
- Better?
- Not even close.

13:53.600 --> 14:01.641
♪ ♪

14:12.486 --> 14:13.836
Greetings, matey.

14:13.921 --> 14:14.921
Drink, <i>amigo?</i>

14:14.989 --> 14:16.723
Whiskey.

14:22.229 --> 14:24.397
So we're looking
for Esteban.

14:24.464 --> 14:25.515
Have you seen him?

14:31.005 --> 14:32.138
Uh, yeah, we seem

14:32.189 --> 14:33.439
<i>to have lost the keys.</i>

14:33.507 --> 14:34.607
It's a funny story,
actually.

14:34.675 --> 14:35.642
You want to see Esteban,

14:35.709 --> 14:37.010
<i>Esteban does not want</i>

14:37.077 --> 14:38.611
to see you.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.129
Put down the gun.

14:56.180 --> 14:58.264
You first.

15:07.538 --> 15:10.307
I asked you
to put the gun down.

15:10.374 --> 15:12.309
I won't ask again.

15:12.376 --> 15:15.278
Uh...No.

15:15.346 --> 15:16.847
Oh, you are such a child.

15:16.914 --> 15:18.114
I hope you're proud
of yourself.

15:18.182 --> 15:19.683
You asked me to help you
find Esteban,

15:19.750 --> 15:20.951
and I'm doing that,

15:21.018 --> 15:22.769
but you're getting lost
in the details, matey.

15:22.854 --> 15:24.921
Details my ass.
Give me the gun.

15:24.989 --> 15:26.990
This gun?

15:27.058 --> 15:29.793
You want this gun?

15:29.861 --> 15:31.278
Come and take it from me.

15:31.362 --> 15:33.296
You don't think I can just
smack you up and take that gun?

15:33.364 --> 15:35.131
No, I really don't.

15:35.199 --> 15:36.233
All right, folks,

15:36.300 --> 15:38.835
you're in
for a little show.

16:11.002 --> 16:12.269
What about
a different plane?

16:12.336 --> 16:14.454
Is there no other way
to fly them out of there?

16:14.539 --> 16:15.639
Not from down there.

16:15.706 --> 16:16.973
Not with this kind
of notice.

16:17.041 --> 16:19.042
We need to figure out a way
to get Harmen

16:19.110 --> 16:20.160
to release that plane.

16:20.244 --> 16:21.511
I've been dealing
with him all week.

16:21.579 --> 16:22.646
<i>He's not
a "bend the rules"</i>

16:22.713 --> 16:24.464
kind of guy.
What are you doing?

16:24.549 --> 16:25.832
I did that an hour ago.
It doesn't work.

16:31.856 --> 16:33.089
You loosened the lid for me.

16:36.460 --> 16:37.661
If Chance
still has his phone,

16:37.728 --> 16:40.063
the satellite
should be locked in on him.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.334
Right there.

16:44.402 --> 16:45.535
What the hell are they doing?

16:46.837 --> 16:48.872
<i>Well, it appears</i>

16:48.940 --> 16:50.540
they're kicking the crap
out of each other.

17:11.829 --> 17:13.530
I assume
this doesn't bode well

17:13.598 --> 17:15.198
for Susan's rescue.

17:15.266 --> 17:16.333
Zoom out, would you?

17:23.773 --> 17:25.875
What's that?

17:25.943 --> 17:27.711
That is a problem.

17:34.377 --> 17:39.047
Come on. Answer your phone.
Answer your phone.

18:15.752 --> 18:17.886
<i>Hola,</i> Esteban.

18:17.954 --> 18:19.988
We were, um,

18:20.056 --> 18:22.558
hoping you could
help us find Cervantes.

18:25.929 --> 18:27.179
So, Esteban,
is it fair to assume

18:27.263 --> 18:29.231
that you're now working
for Cervantes?

18:31.935 --> 18:35.203
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

18:35.271 --> 18:36.672
I got no signal
to lock onto, man.

18:36.739 --> 18:38.006
He must've lost
his phone.

18:38.074 --> 18:39.775
How do we find him?

18:39.826 --> 18:41.843
Uh...
We don't.

18:41.911 --> 18:44.346
No signal to latch on to.

18:44.414 --> 18:46.081
Could take hours
to find him.

18:46.148 --> 18:48.033
Every minute
we spend looking is a minute

18:48.117 --> 18:49.368
we take away
from figuring out a way

18:49.452 --> 18:50.535
to get that plane
off the ground.

18:50.620 --> 18:51.753
So what,
we just leave them there

18:51.821 --> 18:52.871
and hope for the best?

18:52.956 --> 18:54.222
I don't like this
any more than you do.

18:54.290 --> 18:56.291
<i>But right now,
getting that plane free</i>

18:56.359 --> 18:58.594
is the only way we can help
get them home alive.

18:58.661 --> 19:00.512
Yeah, that's assuming
they're not dead already.

19:00.597 --> 19:01.863
- Hey!
- What?

19:01.931 --> 19:03.098
I'm just saying.

19:08.838 --> 19:10.572
You said that Esteban
helped you escape

19:10.640 --> 19:11.773
from Cervantes.

19:11.841 --> 19:13.241
That they were mortal enemies
or something.

19:13.309 --> 19:15.510
Hey, may I remind you,

19:15.578 --> 19:17.779
if you hadn't lost your mind
about me having a weapon,

19:17.847 --> 19:19.748
we probably wouldn't be
in this mess.

19:19.816 --> 19:20.749
You knew the rules.

19:20.817 --> 19:22.017
The rules.

19:22.085 --> 19:23.085
Here we go.

19:23.152 --> 19:25.087
I don't trust you at all

19:25.154 --> 19:27.255
so we stick
to the rules.

19:27.323 --> 19:28.991
You have no idea
how silly that sounds

19:29.058 --> 19:30.492
coming from you.

19:30.560 --> 19:31.760
What I should trust you?

19:31.828 --> 19:33.261
Why shouldn't you?

19:33.329 --> 19:34.896
When you left me
and the old man,

19:34.964 --> 19:36.398
you said nothing.

19:36.466 --> 19:38.700
That decision
must've been brewing

19:38.768 --> 19:41.236
for--for quite
a while, right?

19:41.304 --> 19:42.738
So how many days?

19:42.805 --> 19:45.040
How many conversations
did me and you have

19:45.108 --> 19:47.109
during which the only thought
in your head

19:47.176 --> 19:48.443
was about running away?

19:48.511 --> 19:52.314
And you never said
a word.

19:52.382 --> 19:54.583
You call that being honest?

20:06.029 --> 20:09.031
<i>Dig your graves.</i>

20:11.567 --> 20:13.452
<i>Dude, no way.</i>

20:13.536 --> 20:16.004
Why?
It's a simple Norma Jean.

20:16.072 --> 20:17.439
First of all,
there's no such thing

20:17.507 --> 20:18.840
as a simple Norma Jean,
all right?

20:18.908 --> 20:20.809
<i>When a Norma Jean goes bad,
it goes real bad.</i>

20:20.877 --> 20:22.711
A Norma Jean went bad
on my cousin Pat.

20:22.779 --> 20:24.312
She ended up pregnant
with twins.

20:24.380 --> 20:25.781
Well, you got
a better idea?

20:25.848 --> 20:28.350
Yeah.

20:28.418 --> 20:30.152
Let's call that Ames broad.

20:30.219 --> 20:31.219
She went back East.

20:31.287 --> 20:33.188
Clear head
after that heist debacle.

20:33.256 --> 20:35.057
Fine. Then I'll go.

20:35.124 --> 20:36.458
And do what?

20:36.526 --> 20:38.160
<i>Put a gun
to Harmen's head?</i>

20:38.227 --> 20:40.195
What's wrong with putting
a gun to his head?

20:40.263 --> 20:41.797
A lot of productive things
have happened

20:41.864 --> 20:42.998
by putting a gun
to someone's head.

20:43.066 --> 20:44.299
<i>Wait a second.</i>

20:44.367 --> 20:45.901
<i>Your friend,
Captain Harmen,</i>

20:45.968 --> 20:49.104
said he had a liaison down there
with the Paraguayan Army.

20:49.155 --> 20:51.406
That's probably who he called
to seize the plane, right?

20:51.474 --> 20:53.041
<i>So why don't we call
the guy ourselves,</i>

20:53.109 --> 20:54.309
get him to release
the plane?

20:54.377 --> 20:56.078
We get into Harmen's office,

20:56.145 --> 20:57.312
find out
who that liaison is

20:57.380 --> 20:59.047
and how to contact him.

20:59.115 --> 21:00.882
Then we figure out a way
to make it look like Harmen's

21:00.950 --> 21:02.484
making the call to him.

21:02.552 --> 21:04.352
We get into his office.
But what if he's in his office?

21:04.420 --> 21:06.688
Oh, that's easy.
We'll just send you. What?

21:06.756 --> 21:08.557
Dude?

21:08.624 --> 21:10.459
It's not a bad idea.

21:10.526 --> 21:11.693
It certainly sounds like one.

21:11.761 --> 21:12.894
I agree.

21:14.130 --> 21:16.431
Ilsa...

21:17.900 --> 21:19.034
This ain't that hard.

21:19.102 --> 21:20.368
The info we want

21:20.436 --> 21:22.537
is probably
on Harmen's computer.

21:22.605 --> 21:23.905
Now you just
go down there

21:23.973 --> 21:25.674
and you--you make nice

21:25.742 --> 21:27.409
<i>and say you're sorry
about what happened before.</i>

21:27.477 --> 21:28.443
<i>Then you take
a pirate modem.</i>

21:28.511 --> 21:29.711
Put it close enough
to his computer

21:29.779 --> 21:31.012
so I can hack into it.

21:31.080 --> 21:33.115
The whole thing takes
a couple of minutes.

21:33.182 --> 21:35.317
He's right.
It's a terrible idea.

21:36.853 --> 21:39.921
"I played poker with Rummy."
What happened to that?

21:39.989 --> 21:41.356
That was a game.

21:41.424 --> 21:44.426
What you're asking me
to do...

21:44.494 --> 21:46.261
I'm not a field operative.

21:46.329 --> 21:50.866
Listen, you want to see
your friend Susan alive again,

21:50.933 --> 21:52.667
then you're gonna
become one.

21:58.274 --> 21:59.541
Sorry.

21:59.609 --> 22:01.276
<i>About before.</i>

22:01.344 --> 22:03.445
I probably should've taken
those cuffs off you at the bar.

22:03.513 --> 22:05.013
What, that's it?

22:06.616 --> 22:08.617
What? You want me to be sorry
about something else?

22:08.684 --> 22:12.988
If you don't know,
I'm not gonna explain it to you.

22:13.039 --> 22:15.991
Why don't I hear something
like "hey, junior,

22:16.058 --> 22:17.359
"thanks for the last 24 hours.

22:17.426 --> 22:18.560
It was nice to get
some fresh air."

22:18.628 --> 22:19.661
You had a drink.

22:19.712 --> 22:21.296
You had a few laughs
at my expense.

22:21.363 --> 22:22.798
You got to admit,
this day beats the crap

22:22.865 --> 22:24.766
out of any day you had
in that prison cell.

22:24.834 --> 22:26.201
I shouldn't have been
in that jail cell

22:26.269 --> 22:28.103
for you to find me
in the first place.

22:28.171 --> 22:29.604
Whose fault is that anyway?

22:29.672 --> 22:31.006
Don't get mad at me.

22:31.073 --> 22:32.474
Get mad at the old man.

22:32.542 --> 22:34.476
<i>When I got thrown
in Chi Hoa,</i>

22:34.544 --> 22:35.744
he busted me out
in three weeks.

22:35.812 --> 22:37.445
Yeah, well, that situation
was different.

22:37.513 --> 22:39.047
Why was it different?
'Cause that was <i>you.</i>

22:43.586 --> 22:45.520
He cut you loose,
didn't he?

22:45.588 --> 22:47.656
<i>Why?</i>

22:47.723 --> 22:49.157
Is it because you got caught?

22:49.225 --> 22:52.861
Or maybe it was because you
were doing the catching.

22:52.929 --> 22:54.596
<i>But your guess
is as good</i>

22:54.664 --> 22:55.664
as mine, mate.

22:55.731 --> 22:56.965
But I haven't heard a word
from him

22:57.033 --> 22:59.234
since the last time
we saw each other.

22:59.302 --> 23:01.603
<i>Hurry up.</i>

23:19.722 --> 23:22.357
Señor Baptiste.

23:22.425 --> 23:24.392
<i>I'm surprised
to see you again.</i>

23:24.460 --> 23:26.661
Cervantes.

23:26.729 --> 23:28.463
What are you doing here?

23:28.531 --> 23:31.299
Well, it appears
I'm digging my own grave.

23:31.367 --> 23:33.802
What are you doing <i>here?</i>

23:33.870 --> 23:36.404
<i>Truth be told,</i>

23:36.472 --> 23:38.139
I'm in the market
for a new job

23:38.207 --> 23:40.375
and I'm hoping
that you're hiring.

23:40.443 --> 23:41.877
You son of a...

23:41.944 --> 23:43.979
<i>You want to work for me?</i>

23:44.046 --> 23:44.980
Yes, I do.

23:45.047 --> 23:46.681
<i>Very interesting.</i>

23:46.749 --> 23:48.550
Let's discuss it then,
shall we?

23:50.419 --> 23:51.419
And what about this one?

23:51.487 --> 23:53.722
<i>I don't know.</i>

23:53.789 --> 23:55.857
He may some value
to you.

23:57.393 --> 23:59.527
Thanks for bringing me
down here, junior.

23:59.595 --> 24:01.663
<i>Sorry it had
to be this way.</i>

24:01.731 --> 24:04.499
And, uh, sorry
about this.

24:17.204 --> 24:19.005
Oh, you're awake.

24:20.929 --> 24:22.196
I'm Susan.

24:22.264 --> 24:23.698
Connors.

24:23.766 --> 24:26.167
Yeah, I heard
a little bit about you.

24:26.235 --> 24:28.069
I'm Christopher Chance.

24:28.137 --> 24:30.038
<i>Ilsa Pucci sent me here</i>

24:30.105 --> 24:31.572
to rescue you.

24:31.640 --> 24:33.441
- Ilsa sent you?
- Yeah.

24:33.509 --> 24:36.744
- To rescue me?
- Mm-hmm.

24:36.812 --> 24:38.613
And, uh,
how's this rescue going?

24:38.680 --> 24:40.248
Could be worse.

24:40.315 --> 24:44.552
So...What brings
a nice journalist like you

24:44.620 --> 24:46.054
to a place like this?

24:47.689 --> 24:49.991
Well, I came down here
chasing a story

24:50.059 --> 24:51.359
trying to tie Cervantes
to the murder

24:51.427 --> 24:53.294
of this country's President.

24:53.362 --> 24:54.629
Just before I got caught,

24:54.696 --> 24:56.030
<i>I found the link.</i>

24:56.098 --> 24:57.198
<i>Witnesses who can blow</i>

24:57.266 --> 24:58.966
the story wide open.

24:59.034 --> 25:00.201
Cervantes wants to know
who talked.

25:00.269 --> 25:02.837
So far, my interrogators
have been keeping things

25:02.905 --> 25:04.405
fairly polite.

25:04.473 --> 25:06.474
<i>But something tells me
with you here,</i>

25:06.542 --> 25:08.276
that's about to change.

25:08.343 --> 25:09.510
Yeah, it's a pretty safe bet.

25:09.561 --> 25:11.279
Listen, can you reach my pants
with your foot?

25:12.614 --> 25:13.648
<i>In the lining
of my pocket flap,</i>

25:13.715 --> 25:15.149
there's a syringe
filled with anesthetic.

25:15.217 --> 25:16.417
Maybe we could use it
on your friend

25:16.485 --> 25:17.485
when he comes back.

25:29.398 --> 25:31.099
Do I need to ask
why you have a full syringe

25:31.166 --> 25:32.834
of anesthetic
in your pocket?

25:32.901 --> 25:36.270
Well, I brought someone
with me to help find you.

25:36.338 --> 25:39.140
Someone who I was worried
might try to screw me over.

25:39.208 --> 25:40.808
And where exactly is
this someone now?

25:40.876 --> 25:42.176
Screwing me over.

25:48.350 --> 25:50.184
Join me. Please.

25:54.923 --> 25:57.441
Señor Baptiste.

25:57.526 --> 25:58.442
Your track record

25:58.527 --> 26:00.394
is quite impressive.

26:00.462 --> 26:04.098
Prime Minister Goetz.
Justice Rabang in Manila.

26:04.166 --> 26:05.500
You're an artist.

26:05.567 --> 26:09.904
But our history together,
it makes your proposal,

26:09.972 --> 26:11.606
while tempting,

26:11.673 --> 26:13.674
also somewhat difficult
to believe.

26:13.742 --> 26:18.162
Our past is what it is.

26:18.247 --> 26:19.313
You were unhappy
with my work.

26:19.381 --> 26:20.381
That's your prerogative.

26:20.449 --> 26:21.883
I'd hired you
to do a job--

26:21.950 --> 26:23.451
you hired me
to eliminate a man,

26:23.519 --> 26:25.620
which I did.

26:25.687 --> 26:28.256
And you wanted him
humiliated, tortured.

26:28.323 --> 26:31.726
It's simply not me.

26:31.793 --> 26:32.894
It's inelegant.

26:36.798 --> 26:38.032
Is that my watch?

26:40.869 --> 26:43.871
No.
That is Esteban's watch.

26:43.939 --> 26:45.373
<i>A gift</i>

26:45.440 --> 26:46.607
from me.

26:46.675 --> 26:47.909
Well, then

26:47.976 --> 26:49.944
let's forget about our past

26:50.012 --> 26:52.146
and discuss our future,
shall we?

26:54.116 --> 26:56.684
Be careful.
I've almost got it.

27:32.955 --> 27:34.455
Unh!

27:40.862 --> 27:43.397
Unh!

27:43.465 --> 27:45.032
I can't believe
that worked.

27:45.100 --> 27:47.068
Me neither.

27:47.135 --> 27:48.369
All right, he's probably
got a knife on him--

27:48.437 --> 27:49.437
let's find it

27:49.504 --> 27:51.372
and cut ourselves down.

27:55.894 --> 27:57.044
Put that in your ear.

27:57.095 --> 27:58.646
Oh, God.

27:58.714 --> 27:59.780
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

27:59.848 --> 28:01.282
It's gonna be easy.

28:01.350 --> 28:03.317
Just take this pirate modem.
See?

28:03.385 --> 28:04.719
So you turn it on
right there.

28:04.786 --> 28:06.254
Get that within range

28:06.321 --> 28:08.489
of Harmen's computer.

28:08.557 --> 28:10.291
And I'll take it
from there.

28:10.359 --> 28:12.443
<i>All right, I'm in position.</i>

28:12.527 --> 28:14.662
She moving yet?

28:14.729 --> 28:15.830
Getting there.

28:15.897 --> 28:17.231
<i>Take your time, dude.</i>

28:17.282 --> 28:19.066
View's real nice
from up here.

28:19.134 --> 28:20.301
So what's he doing again?

28:20.369 --> 28:21.969
He's gonna splice
into their switchboard

28:22.037 --> 28:23.571
so that when we call
Paraguay

28:23.639 --> 28:25.139
to get your plane
released,

28:25.207 --> 28:27.108
it'll sound like the call's
coming from Harmen's office.

28:27.175 --> 28:29.944
Now, listen,
once we're logged in,

28:30.012 --> 28:31.746
Harmen gets locked out
of his computer.

28:31.813 --> 28:33.798
So he can't be on there
while I'm doing my search.

28:33.882 --> 28:36.250
So how do I keep him
from looking at his computer?

28:40.989 --> 28:45.526
Opening a button
might help.

28:45.594 --> 28:48.763
I'm not even gonna dignify that
with a response.

28:48.830 --> 28:50.331
You sure?

28:54.903 --> 28:57.004
Mrs. Pucci.

28:57.072 --> 28:59.807
Hello, Captain.

28:59.875 --> 29:01.142
How are you?

29:01.209 --> 29:04.245
I'm fine.
What are you doing down here?

29:04.313 --> 29:05.913
I don't feel very good
about yesterday,

29:05.981 --> 29:08.449
and I was hoping
we could maybe talk about it

29:08.500 --> 29:09.717
a little bit.

29:11.320 --> 29:12.353
Come on in.

29:12.421 --> 29:14.755
<i>Margaret,
this is Ilsa Pucci.</i>

29:14.823 --> 29:15.956
Hello.

29:16.024 --> 29:17.758
Hello. Margaret.

29:17.826 --> 29:19.193
<i>Please tell me</i>

29:19.261 --> 29:20.761
<i>Margaret is not sitting
in front of the computer.</i>

29:20.829 --> 29:22.697
Mm-hmm.

29:22.764 --> 29:25.099
<i>Look, I can't hack in</i>

29:25.150 --> 29:27.335
till you get her
away from there.

29:27.402 --> 29:29.136
<i>Oh, it's a simple Norma Jean.</i>

29:29.204 --> 29:30.438
Nothing to worry about.

29:30.505 --> 29:31.489
Oh, shut up!

29:32.941 --> 29:35.543
What I am offering you

29:35.610 --> 29:38.496
are the services
of a professional without peer.

29:38.580 --> 29:40.815
I think there's a path
over there that leads

29:40.882 --> 29:41.816
to the front gate.

29:41.883 --> 29:43.017
We're not taking
the front gate.

29:43.085 --> 29:44.985
Baptiste said
it's too heavily guarded.

29:45.053 --> 29:46.387
Do you know
of any other way out?

29:46.455 --> 29:47.388
He mentioned a back way,

29:47.456 --> 29:48.456
but I don't know
where to find it.

29:48.523 --> 29:49.690
Well, you got
any better ideas?

29:52.060 --> 29:53.377
So please

29:53.462 --> 29:55.830
think carefully
before you throw out a number

29:55.897 --> 29:58.899
less you insult me
and lose out on this opportunity

29:58.967 --> 30:00.835
altogether.

30:00.902 --> 30:02.870
20 million.

30:07.342 --> 30:08.409
Dollars?

30:08.477 --> 30:11.979
U.S. for a year
of your time.

30:18.420 --> 30:19.887
There's one condition.

30:19.955 --> 30:21.756
It's my understanding

30:21.823 --> 30:24.058
that the man
you arrived here with

30:24.126 --> 30:26.260
was once quite close
to you.

30:30.031 --> 30:32.900
You understand
I need to be certain

30:32.968 --> 30:35.603
that you and he are not
playing me for a fool.

30:39.707 --> 30:40.741
Hmm. Kill him

30:40.809 --> 30:42.476
<i>and then
we'll have a deal.</i>

30:44.212 --> 30:46.447
Sounds perfectly
reasonable to me.

30:46.515 --> 30:47.615
Good.

30:54.697 --> 30:56.031
<i>Hello, fellas.</i>

30:58.618 --> 31:00.869
If you've come to argue
about your ground rules again,

31:00.937 --> 31:02.905
I think you're going
to be sorely disappointed.

31:02.972 --> 31:05.240
We can discuss that later.
That's not why I'm here.

31:05.308 --> 31:07.443
No?
Then why are you here?

31:07.510 --> 31:10.646
To ask for your help.

31:14.651 --> 31:17.519
I'm sorry?
You're asking for my help?

31:17.587 --> 31:18.520
Still?

31:18.588 --> 31:21.757
I'm getting real tired
of it too.

31:21.825 --> 31:23.959
But you know the way
out of here, I don't.

31:24.027 --> 31:25.961
You gave me your word.

31:26.029 --> 31:27.996
I came here to see
what it's worth.

31:36.773 --> 31:39.074
I am deeply sorry
I have to do this.

31:40.477 --> 31:42.211
But I will be taking
that watch back now.

31:54.290 --> 31:55.224
Get in!

32:11.941 --> 32:13.108
Chance,
where the hell are you?

32:13.159 --> 32:14.326
What's going on?

32:14.410 --> 32:15.410
<i>We've got Susan.</i>

32:15.478 --> 32:16.478
We're heading to the plane.

32:16.546 --> 32:17.813
Is there anything else
I should know?

32:17.881 --> 32:19.381
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:19.449 --> 32:21.183
Stand by.

32:21.251 --> 32:23.352
<i>Ilsa, you need to hurry.</i>

32:23.419 --> 32:24.486
I'm a little confused.

32:24.554 --> 32:26.155
You're here to apologize
about yesterday?

32:26.222 --> 32:27.222
Yes.

32:27.290 --> 32:28.524
So you admit the plane
down there

32:28.591 --> 32:30.159
is part
of a rescue mission?

32:30.226 --> 32:31.160
<i>I've been advised</i>

32:31.227 --> 32:32.461
<i>not to answer that question.</i>

32:32.529 --> 32:34.796
All right, I'm patched
into the switchboard.

32:34.864 --> 32:36.165
She got the modem on yet?

32:36.232 --> 32:39.067
Not yet. Ilsa.

32:39.135 --> 32:40.903
<i>Listen, you got to get</i>

32:40.970 --> 32:42.838
that damn computer clear.

32:44.240 --> 32:45.174
I'm sorry.

32:45.241 --> 32:46.241
Could you ask
your secretary

32:46.309 --> 32:47.276
if she could give us
a minute

32:47.343 --> 32:49.778
to speak in private?

32:49.846 --> 32:52.114
I am a Senior Policy
Analyst.

32:55.318 --> 32:57.319
Ahem.

33:03.026 --> 33:04.026
Thank you, Margaret.

33:05.195 --> 33:06.862
Chance,

33:06.930 --> 33:08.063
<i>we're trying to free up
the plane.</i>

33:08.131 --> 33:09.097
<i>We need a couple of minutes.</i>

33:09.165 --> 33:10.098
<i>I don't have</i>

33:10.166 --> 33:12.534
<i>a couple of minutes.</i>

33:17.340 --> 33:19.808
Please have a seat.

33:28.785 --> 33:30.452
We're in.

33:30.520 --> 33:32.321
All right,
Mrs. Pucci,

33:32.388 --> 33:34.756
what is it you want
to talk about?

33:34.824 --> 33:37.259
<i>Modem's been activated.
We're uploading.</i>

33:37.327 --> 33:38.427
<i>Well...</i>

33:38.494 --> 33:40.829
I feel as if
we don't really

33:40.896 --> 33:42.497
know each other
very well.

33:49.005 --> 33:50.105
Hey, save a bullet.
Why?

33:50.173 --> 33:51.106
Machinegun nests

33:51.174 --> 33:52.107
either side
of the rear gate.

33:52.175 --> 33:53.275
Distance.
Once we get

33:53.343 --> 33:55.344
around the turn,
about 30 meters.

33:55.411 --> 33:56.478
Not gonna give us
much time.

33:56.546 --> 33:57.613
About two or three seconds

33:57.680 --> 33:59.181
and then we're full
of holes.

34:03.519 --> 34:06.822
Okay, turn's coming.
You ready? Ready.

34:11.476 --> 34:12.527
Yah!

34:19.502 --> 34:20.768
Next left! Take it!

34:20.837 --> 34:22.437
Come on, dude, give me a number.

34:22.505 --> 34:24.739
Hang on. Hang on.
Hang on.

34:27.710 --> 34:31.679
So I assume you went
to college.

34:31.748 --> 34:33.614
Yeah.

34:33.683 --> 34:35.217
Yes, I did.

34:35.284 --> 34:36.217
Did you like it?

34:36.286 --> 34:37.386
Mrs. Pucci,

34:37.453 --> 34:39.655
you come
all the way down here.

34:39.722 --> 34:41.723
You offer me one of the more
bizarre apologies

34:41.791 --> 34:42.791
I've ever heard.

34:42.859 --> 34:44.693
You dismiss a woman
from my office

34:44.761 --> 34:46.360
who is probably going
to be my boss one day

34:46.429 --> 34:48.463
to ask me questions
about where I went to school

34:48.531 --> 34:51.033
and whether or not I'm allowed
to wear jeans on fridays?

34:51.100 --> 34:52.400
What are you doing here?

34:52.467 --> 34:54.402
And I want
a straight answer.

34:54.469 --> 34:57.139
Well...

34:57.206 --> 34:58.907
That's a completely fair
question.

34:58.975 --> 35:01.310
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on.

35:04.480 --> 35:06.381
One moment.
Are you seeing anyone?

35:08.951 --> 35:10.886
Did you just ask me out?

35:10.953 --> 35:12.020
Yeah.

35:12.088 --> 35:13.755
Yes, I did.

35:15.291 --> 35:18.060
I just felt
there might be some chemistry

35:18.127 --> 35:20.829
here between us.

35:20.897 --> 35:21.963
You?

35:24.934 --> 35:25.867
Got it.

35:25.935 --> 35:27.035
<i>Good job, Ilsa.</i>

35:27.103 --> 35:28.136
<i>We're done.
Get out of there.</i>

35:28.204 --> 35:30.105
Okay then. I better go.

35:36.312 --> 35:39.081
<i>Captain Carlos Montoya.</i>

35:39.148 --> 35:41.316
Sending you the number.

35:41.367 --> 35:43.652
Got it.

35:48.041 --> 35:49.157
This is Captain Harmen.

35:49.225 --> 35:51.393
I need to speak
to Captain Montoya right away.

35:53.363 --> 35:54.413
Montoya.
<i>Montoya, this is Harmen.</i>

35:54.497 --> 35:55.664
<i>Release the plane
immediately.</i>

35:55.715 --> 35:56.798
Yes, sir.

36:03.940 --> 36:05.774
There's a military
barricade.

36:05.842 --> 36:06.758
What should I do?

36:06.843 --> 36:07.876
They're not moving.

36:07.944 --> 36:09.010
Just don't stop.

36:53.687 --> 36:56.522
You know, with most people,

36:56.589 --> 36:57.973
when I haven't seen them
for a few months,

36:58.058 --> 37:00.126
the big surprise is
they've changed their hair.

37:01.728 --> 37:04.096
What the hell
are you doing here?

37:04.164 --> 37:07.266
Truthfully,
I have no idea.

37:10.404 --> 37:13.939
I guess I'm--I'm doing
what Marshall

37:14.007 --> 37:15.508
would've wanted me to.

37:15.575 --> 37:17.743
Yeah.

37:20.080 --> 37:21.414
So where did you find
the guy?

37:21.481 --> 37:22.915
Chance?

37:24.551 --> 37:26.552
Oh, God.

37:26.620 --> 37:28.821
Really? I don't know.

37:28.889 --> 37:30.389
Seemed nice enough to me.

37:30.457 --> 37:32.291
Excuse me a sec, Susan.

37:36.129 --> 37:38.697
So...What are you
doing here?

37:38.765 --> 37:40.533
Oh, I think we both know
what I'm doing here.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.301
Your plane was released
from local control

37:42.369 --> 37:44.403
roughly 18 hours ago.

37:44.471 --> 37:46.839
Communications mix-up

37:46.907 --> 37:50.209
according to my contact
down there.

37:50.277 --> 37:52.044
<i>And now I see Susan Connors
sitting in your office</i>

37:52.112 --> 37:55.681
<i>safe and sound.</i>

37:55.749 --> 37:58.684
You gamed me.

37:58.752 --> 38:00.719
I don't know how,
but you did.

38:04.891 --> 38:08.294
You know,
there is one more thing

38:08.361 --> 38:09.661
I'd like to know.

38:09.713 --> 38:10.696
What?

38:10.764 --> 38:12.331
<i>When you asked me</i>

38:12.399 --> 38:13.332
if I was seeing someone,

38:13.400 --> 38:14.333
was that part of the game

38:14.401 --> 38:16.936
or did you really want
to know?

38:18.238 --> 38:19.905
I think...

38:21.007 --> 38:22.007
Well, uh,
I would ask you

38:22.075 --> 38:24.343
to remember that...

38:24.411 --> 38:27.246
Given the context--
so I'll pick you up at 8:00.

38:48.702 --> 38:50.369
Don't do it.

38:50.437 --> 38:52.872
It's not even the most
expensive one on the tray.

38:52.939 --> 38:56.842
No. But it's your favorite
so you can't have any.

38:56.910 --> 38:58.010
Yet again.

38:58.078 --> 38:59.512
Focused
on the little details

38:59.579 --> 39:00.896
and missing out
on the bigger picture.

39:00.981 --> 39:03.482
Which is?
That you trusted me.

39:03.550 --> 39:06.585
And you were rewarded
for that trust.

39:06.653 --> 39:07.736
Let's go overboard here, okay?

39:07.821 --> 39:08.938
I know you better
than you think.

39:09.022 --> 39:10.289
And there was a moment
back there

39:10.357 --> 39:11.891
where you were thinking
about shooting me.

39:11.958 --> 39:13.726
I was not.
Yes, you were.

39:13.793 --> 39:15.861
Well, the man made
a convincing argument.

39:15.929 --> 39:18.831
And I do have material needs.
I'm only human.

39:18.899 --> 39:20.733
And besides,

39:20.800 --> 39:22.468
it suddenly occurred to me

39:22.536 --> 39:25.471
that--and despite
what this says about me

39:25.539 --> 39:27.740
and despite how truly
distressing the thought...

39:30.577 --> 39:33.212
You might be the last friend
I've got on this earth.

39:33.280 --> 39:35.814
I've spent most
of the last six years

39:35.882 --> 39:37.716
wishing you were dead.

39:37.784 --> 39:38.784
We're not friends.

39:38.852 --> 39:40.953
Not by any definition
I know of.

39:41.021 --> 39:45.524
Well, yeah, beggars
can't be choosers, right?

39:47.227 --> 39:49.194
It makes this
so much more unpleasant.

39:49.262 --> 39:50.829
Hold this.

39:50.897 --> 39:53.966
What?

39:54.034 --> 39:55.000
Really?

39:55.068 --> 39:55.985
In my defense,

39:56.069 --> 39:57.703
I was extremely frank

39:57.771 --> 39:59.538
about my intentions
on this trip.

39:59.606 --> 40:00.739
I simply can't have you

40:00.807 --> 40:02.174
put me back in that cell.

40:02.242 --> 40:04.376
I think we both know
you're not gonna shoot me.

40:07.347 --> 40:08.747
Oh, come on.
What did he ever do to you?

40:08.815 --> 40:10.983
Let's discuss
what's gonna happen next.

40:11.051 --> 40:14.320
I'm gonna enjoy a glass
of my favorite cognac.

40:14.387 --> 40:17.122
<i>You tell the pilot
we're diverting to Caracas.</i>

40:17.190 --> 40:19.525
Once we land,
I'll walk out.

40:19.593 --> 40:21.844
I think you know
that I can't let that happen.

40:21.928 --> 40:24.730
Be that as it may...

40:24.797 --> 40:26.565
<i>Salud.</i>

40:29.336 --> 40:30.469
I have a counter proposal.

40:32.572 --> 40:33.505
Do you now?

40:33.573 --> 40:35.441
Come work for me.

40:35.492 --> 40:37.860
I beg your pardon?

40:37.944 --> 40:38.877
You heard me.

40:38.945 --> 40:39.878
I think you enjoyed helping.

40:39.946 --> 40:41.080
<i>I think there's more</i>

40:41.147 --> 40:42.414
<i>to the old man
cutting you off story</i>

40:42.482 --> 40:43.782
<i>than you're letting on.</i>

40:43.850 --> 40:46.085
I think you're about
where I was three years ago.

40:46.152 --> 40:47.886
And no more ready
to talk about it either.

40:47.954 --> 40:50.356
You're joking.

40:50.423 --> 40:51.507
<i>Maybe.</i>

40:51.591 --> 40:52.858
You saying
you don't trust me?

40:52.926 --> 40:55.694
Not one...

40:59.766 --> 41:02.501
Oh-ho-ho.

41:05.271 --> 41:07.873
Ketamine in the cognac.

41:07.941 --> 41:09.942
Yeah, I figured
you couldn't resist.

41:10.010 --> 41:13.379
Sorry, but I was Frank
about my intentions.

41:13.446 --> 41:15.648
I got to take you back
to where I got you.

41:15.715 --> 41:18.484
That's very clever.

41:18.551 --> 41:23.155
Man, I really missed you.

41:38.872 --> 41:40.506
Do I even want to know?

41:40.573 --> 41:42.074
Probably not.

41:42.142 --> 41:44.076
So what happened
with Baptiste?

41:44.144 --> 41:45.678
I offered him a job.

41:45.745 --> 41:46.912
Dude, seriously?

41:46.980 --> 41:48.580
I don't have to put up
with enough around here?

41:48.648 --> 41:50.582
He turned it down.

41:50.650 --> 41:52.117
At least there's still
a little integrity

41:52.185 --> 41:54.353
<i>left among criminals.</i>

41:54.421 --> 41:56.455
So where is he?
Well, let's see.

41:56.523 --> 41:57.589
Right about now
it should be

41:57.657 --> 41:59.958
chow time in Siberia.

42:00.026 --> 42:01.860
Bet he didn't want
to part with that.

42:03.496 --> 42:04.963
So...

42:05.031 --> 42:06.565
How'd you get
the Paraguayan Army

42:06.633 --> 42:07.800
to let us on the plane?

42:07.867 --> 42:09.168
Norma Jean.

42:09.235 --> 42:10.369
It's impossible.

42:10.437 --> 42:12.705
Can't bluff a Norma Jean
with just two guys.

42:12.772 --> 42:14.106
They had some help.

42:15.742 --> 42:16.809
Are you serious?

42:16.876 --> 42:18.143
I'm gone two days
and she's out

42:18.211 --> 42:20.312
on the field?
Not my call, dude.

42:20.380 --> 42:21.880
I'll clean that later.

42:21.948 --> 42:24.316
<i>Mr. Chance,</i>

42:24.384 --> 42:25.851
I told you I was prepared
to rescue Susan

42:25.919 --> 42:27.553
by any means necessary.

42:27.620 --> 42:29.488
But I thought we had
this conversation.

42:29.556 --> 42:31.690
There's about a million things
that could've gone wrong.

42:31.758 --> 42:32.891
You could've been arrested.

42:32.942 --> 42:34.760
You were risking your life
to save my friend.

42:34.828 --> 42:36.962
The least I could do
was risk my reputation.

42:37.030 --> 42:39.865
Suppose a "thank you"
is in order.

42:39.933 --> 42:45.704
No. It's I who should thank you
for bringing Susan safely home.

42:45.772 --> 42:47.840
It looks like
it wasn't easy.

42:47.907 --> 42:51.376
Oh, comes with the turf.

42:51.444 --> 42:53.979
Sometimes a mission stays
with you after it's done.

42:54.047 --> 42:57.082
So I'm learning.
Good night.

42:59.018 --> 43:00.486
Where you going?

43:00.553 --> 43:04.223
I guess we both made a bit
of a sacrifice on this one.

43:07.127 --> 43:09.511
I have a date...

43:09.596 --> 43:10.662
With Captain Harmen.

43:13.333 --> 43:14.425
