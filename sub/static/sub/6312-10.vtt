00:01.530 --> 00:04.419
Previously, on Elementary...
Murder in Paris.

00:04.470 --> 00:05.698
French businesswoman,

00:05.730 --> 00:07.732
Sabine Raoult,
was gunned down in the street.

00:07.770 --> 00:09.306
The crime was never solved.

00:09.340 --> 00:11.308
The two bullets missing
from the crime scene

00:11.340 --> 00:13.035
ended up in my father.

00:13.080 --> 00:14.570
Nobody at Interpol knows
what I've done.

00:14.610 --> 00:16.305
Truly above and beyond

00:16.350 --> 00:17.601
this time, Agent Muller.

00:17.650 --> 00:19.379
This business with your son--

00:19.420 --> 00:21.513
do you expect me to believe
you're here to help him?

00:21.550 --> 00:23.586
Did you know you had
a predecessor, Lukas?

00:23.620 --> 00:26.783
His name was
Jasper De Clerq.

00:26.820 --> 00:28.082
My God, Morland.

00:29.260 --> 00:31.228
His childr found him.

00:31.260 --> 00:33.399
I think Sabine
was collateral damage.

00:33.430 --> 00:34.795
Morland was the target.

00:34.830 --> 00:37.321
Someone tried to kill
your father,

00:37.370 --> 00:39.338
and he's worried
they're gonna try again.

00:39.370 --> 00:42.134
* Bum, be-bum, bum, bum

00:42.170 --> 00:43.762
* Bum, be-bum,
bum, bum *

00:43.810 --> 00:44.731
* Bum...

00:46.640 --> 00:50.098
I could have sworn
I had that statue removed.

00:51.150 --> 00:52.708
Oh, dear.

00:54.320 --> 00:57.289
I've done something new
to anger you.

00:57.320 --> 00:59.413
It's what you didn't do.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.610
You didn't mention
you were the target

01:01.660 --> 01:03.651
of a _failed
assassmation attempt

01:03.690 --> 01:05.851
which left a woman
named Sabine dead,

01:05.890 --> 01:09.326
and you more empty on the inside
than you already were.

01:11.170 --> 01:12.762
How did you find out?

01:12.800 --> 01:16.463
Watson grew suspicious after
observing your eating habits.

01:19.540 --> 01:23.408
I don't speak of it because
I find the matter painful.

01:24.780 --> 01:26.372
Sabine and I were...

01:26.420 --> 01:28.411
very close.

01:28.450 --> 01:29.747
You also failed to mention
that whoever

01:29.790 --> 01:31.439
was behind
the attempt is still at large,

01:31.490 --> 01:33.811
and that you believe
another attempt is likely.

01:33.860 --> 01:37.421
Why else would you be
banking your own blood?

01:37.460 --> 01:40.452
By insinuating yourself
into our lives

01:40.500 --> 01:42.468
without disclosing any of this

01:42.500 --> 01:44.764
and without sharing
whatever intelligence you have

01:44.800 --> 01:47.360
so that we might implement
our own precautions,

01:47.400 --> 01:49.436
you've placed us in danger.

01:49.470 --> 01:52.303
Well, it's nice to see
that my well-being

01:52.340 --> 01:54.535
is essential
to your concerns as ever.

01:55.840 --> 01:59.139
Joan's deductions
are only partly correct.

01:59.180 --> 02:01.546
It's true someone
tried to kill me.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.787
That should come
as no surprise.

02:03.820 --> 02:06.459
(chuckles): One makes...
one's share of enemies

02:06.490 --> 02:08.412
in my line of work.

02:08.460 --> 02:11.452
Where she and the truth
part ways

02:11.490 --> 02:15.358
is in the assumption
that I am presently in danger.

02:16.600 --> 02:19.694
Banking my blood is
a precaution.

02:19.740 --> 02:24.165
Complications from this type
of injury can flare up

02:24.210 --> 02:26.405
years down the road.

02:26.440 --> 02:29.170
I could be rushed
back into surgery at any time.

02:29.210 --> 02:32.577
As for your safety
and Joan's,

02:32.620 --> 02:35.714
the would-be assassin
has been dealt with.

02:35.750 --> 02:37.615
It's over.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.557
Well, you're lying,
so I'll just

02:40.590 --> 02:42.455
have to investigate
the matter myself.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.229
Hey!

03:00.280 --> 03:01.599
Eyes outside.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.801
What if they
come home early?
Hey.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.444
They ain't comin' home early,
and you know they aren't.

03:06.480 --> 03:09.483
I know that you're supposed
to be the lookout,

03:09.520 --> 03:10.919
so look out!

03:10.950 --> 03:12.815
(quietly):
All right.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.268
(gunshots)

03:31.310 --> 03:33.608
(dog barking)

03:35.940 --> 03:36.975
What was that?

03:37.010 --> 03:38.978
You see something?

03:39.010 --> 03:41.649
I saw everything.

03:41.680 --> 03:42.681
*

03:52.300 --> 03:54.325
*

04:04.710 --> 04:06.837
(groans)

04:08.980 --> 04:10.504
(groan)

04:16.050 --> 04:18.541
(sighs)

04:18.590 --> 04:19.989
WATSON:
Hey, where were you?

04:20.020 --> 04:21.453
You left your cell pho...

04:21.490 --> 04:22.525
What happened?

04:22.560 --> 04:24.528
Ah, just another failed attempt

04:24.560 --> 04:27.051
to gather information
on my father's shooting.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.920
Okay, well,
let me help you with this.

04:28.960 --> 04:30.063
(grunts)

04:30.100 --> 04:31.624
What happened to asking

04:31.670 --> 04:33.365
your contacts at Scotland Yard?

04:33.400 --> 04:35.368
Scotland Yard have
been kept in the dark.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.537
Likewise the French police.

04:36.570 --> 04:38.401
It seems Father has
kept a tight lid

04:38.440 --> 04:39.600
on the investigation.

04:39.640 --> 04:40.800
So you decided to try beating

04:40.840 --> 04:42.876
the answers out Of someone?

04:42.910 --> 04:44.946
I touched base with a contact
InSIde a mercenary group

04:44.980 --> 04:46.538
that Father sometimes employs.

04:46.580 --> 04:47.945
I had to leave
my phone at home,

04:47.980 --> 04:49.413
because she's sensitive

04:49.450 --> 04:50.917
about the presence
of microphones.

04:52.590 --> 04:55.013
A woman did this to you?

04:55.060 --> 04:58.484
A highly trained woman.

04:58.530 --> 04:59.929
Well, it doesn't look like

04:59.960 --> 05:01.894
she wanted
to touch base with you.

05:01.930 --> 05:03.795
Quite the contrary.

05:09.040 --> 05:11.736
Some of this isn't blood.

05:12.940 --> 05:14.498
It's lipstick.

05:14.540 --> 05:16.349
And you smell like perfume.

05:18.080 --> 05:21.743
Were you in a fight,
or were you having sex?

05:21.780 --> 05:24.089
The two aren_'t
mutually excluswe.

05:29.160 --> 05:32.391
Anyway, I'm confident her
employers are also in the dark.

05:32.430 --> 05:33.920
Well, while you
were sparring,

05:33.960 --> 05:35.655
you missed a call.

05:35.700 --> 05:37.395
I'll check my voice mail.

05:37.430 --> 05:40.399
(sighs): No need. It was
one of the counselors

05:40.440 --> 05:42.601
at Hemdale-- Gene Winnick.

05:42.640 --> 05:44.767
When he couldn't reach
you, he called me.

05:44.810 --> 05:45.902
I remember him.

05:45.940 --> 05:47.601
He's a nice bloke.

05:47.640 --> 05:49.130
He wanted us to contact
a friend of us,

05:49.180 --> 05:52.069
a woman who runs a halfway house
on the Lower East Side.

05:52.110 --> 05:55.113
She thinks she has information
about a murder.

05:59.050 --> 06:01.757
Are your residents
mostly men in recovery?

06:01.790 --> 06:04.782
We also have a lot of parolees
who have been released

06:04.830 --> 06:06.889
to transitional housing;
some homeless, too.

06:06.930 --> 06:10.593
You said you knew
something about a murder.

06:10.630 --> 06:13.064
His name was Dennis Hicks.

06:13.100 --> 06:16.900
He was shot in his apartment
in Queens two weeks ago.

06:16.940 --> 06:19.033
The police think
he was killed by robbers.

06:19.070 --> 06:21.004
But you think otherwise?

06:22.550 --> 06:23.903
Let's go to my office.

06:23.950 --> 06:27.408
Fairbridge University--
you've heard of it?

06:27.450 --> 06:29.145
They have ads
all over the city.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.887
And they've been
in the news a lot lately.

06:31.920 --> 06:34.059
Government is cracking down
on for-profit colleges,

06:34.090 --> 06:36.581
and Fairbridge's name
comes up a lot.

06:36.630 --> 06:37.983
They're being investigated

06:38.030 --> 06:40.692
by the Department of Education
right now.

06:40.730 --> 06:42.721
Long list of accusations,

06:42.770 --> 06:45.659
including
illegal recruiting tactics.

06:45.700 --> 06:48.464
Since federal loans make up
most of their income,

06:48.500 --> 06:51.606
if it doesn't go their way,
they get shut down.

06:51.640 --> 06:54.837
Dennis was a _recruiter
for FaIrbrIdge.

06:54.880 --> 06:57.747
He was about to testify
as a whistle-blower.

06:57.780 --> 06:59.839
That's why they killed him.

06:59.880 --> 07:01.518
Or so you believe.

07:01.550 --> 07:03.814
Uh, so what's your
connection to all of this

07:03.850 --> 07:06.045
beyond Dennis Hicks
being someone you knew?

07:06.090 --> 07:08.217
Fairbridge University owns us.

07:08.260 --> 07:11.457
So why would a college
want to own a halfway house?

07:11.490 --> 07:13.697
Because we're a source
of warm bodies

07:13.730 --> 07:15.459
and social security numbers--

07:15.500 --> 07:17.889
and that's pretty much
all they care about.

07:20.740 --> 07:23.231
Five years ago,
we were hurting for cash.

07:23.270 --> 07:25.238
When Fairbridge
offered to buy us,

07:25.270 --> 07:27.602
even I thought
it was a good idea.

07:27.640 --> 07:29.801
Turns out we let
the devil in the door.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.704
Ever since, the school's

07:31.750 --> 07:33.877
been aggressively
recruiting our residents.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.115
And I'm not allowed
to do anything about it.

07:36.150 --> 07:37.742
Um...

07:37.790 --> 07:39.985
forgive our ignorance--
my partner and I tend

07:40.020 --> 07:41.749
to think of higher education
as being a good thing,

07:41.790 --> 07:43.553
so what is so bad
about people

07:43.590 --> 07:44.579
who are trying
to turn their lives around

07:44.630 --> 07:45.858
going to college?

07:45.890 --> 07:47.221
If they were getting
a real education

07:47.260 --> 07:49.569
_ and if there was
real fInanCIal support for them,

07:49.600 --> 07:50.965
I'd be all for it.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.230
But with this,
they're flat-out lied to.

07:53.270 --> 07:55.568
Recruiters promise degrees

07:55.600 --> 07:57.033
that the school
doesn't even offer,

07:57.070 --> 07:59.834
and help with job placement
that they never give.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.609
They'll say anything
to get people to sign

08:01.640 --> 08:03.779
on the dotted line.
And in this case,

08:03.810 --> 08:06.745
the dotted lines _are_
on student loan applications.

08:06.780 --> 08:09.908
The school gets its money,
and when my guys get out

08:09.950 --> 08:12.714
or drop out, they're
just as unemployable as ever,

08:12.760 --> 08:14.512
only now they're buried in debt.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.620
And whatever money they do make
is seized by collectors.

08:17.660 --> 08:19.025
And we all know
how helpful that is

08:19.060 --> 08:20.527
when you're trying
to get your life

08:20.560 --> 08:22.198
back on track.

08:22.230 --> 08:24.767
I've assembled a list of cases

08:24.800 --> 08:27.166
that I'm presenting
to the DOE.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.031
Vulnerable people

08:29.070 --> 08:30.560
who I promised to help

08:30.610 --> 08:33.101
who have been criminally
deceived by Fairbridge.

08:33.140 --> 08:35.074
Now, I've talked
to the police,

08:35.110 --> 08:37.078
but they just think
I'm crazy.

08:38.180 --> 08:41.047
A good man's been murdered.

08:41.080 --> 08:43.844
So... what do you say?

08:43.890 --> 08:46.108
Will you look into it?

08:48.820 --> 08:51.027
It says here Dennis Hicks
lived in Astoria.

08:51.060 --> 08:52.652
That's the 116.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.827
We could reach out
to whoever caught the case,

08:54.860 --> 08:56.157
at least see where it stands.

08:56.200 --> 08:57.929
Assuming there's
a case left to see.

08:57.970 --> 08:59.892
(phone chimes)
Crime scene's two weeks old.

08:59.940 --> 09:03.159
Body's probably
in the ground already.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.905
Ooh.

09:04.940 --> 09:06.908
You remember Lukas Muller,
the, uh, Interpol agent?

09:06.940 --> 09:08.202
Sure.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.071
He got us information
on that Swiss bank account

09:10.110 --> 09:11.907
a few weeks ago.
My father pays him

09:11.950 --> 09:14.214
for such help-- now, if he
was in the old man's pocket

09:14.250 --> 09:17.686
two years ago, stands to reason
he was asked to investigate

09:17.720 --> 09:19.779
the shooting which cost
Sabine Raoult her life.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.788
Well, you're assuming
there was an investigation.

09:21.820 --> 09:23.685
Your father may know
exactly who came after him.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.152
And then discreetly

09:25.190 --> 09:26.828
handled the matter himself? No.

09:26.860 --> 09:29.351
He was lying when he said
the matter was resolved.

09:29.400 --> 09:32.324
Anyway, I reached out to Muller
several times; no response.

09:32.370 --> 09:34.838
But my contact
at Interpol's New York office

09:34.870 --> 09:37.236
has just told me
he's in town for a conference.

09:37.270 --> 09:39.033
So while
I'm looking into this,

09:39.070 --> 09:41.834
are you gonna fight Muller
or are you gonna sleep with him?

09:41.880 --> 09:43.848
You get any pushback at the 116,

09:43.880 --> 09:45.905
just remind their lieutenant
that he owes me.

09:45.950 --> 09:48.817
I helped get his two-timing
son-in-law deported.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.649
Body was found
on the floor over there.

09:55.690 --> 09:58.853
Three rounds
from a nine-millimeter.

09:58.890 --> 10:02.929
Looks like the intruders
took the stereo, Xbox...

10:02.970 --> 10:05.359
some things off the counter.

10:05.400 --> 10:07.265
Apartment's paid up
for the month,

10:07.300 --> 10:11.669
so the landlord gave the family
time to clean it out.

10:11.710 --> 10:14.270
I got to ask:
why does Major Crimes

10:14.310 --> 10:16.642
need a consultant
to go over all this?

10:16.680 --> 10:17.977
I'm not checking your work.

10:18.010 --> 10:19.648
A friend of the victim
asked us to take a look.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.773
You might have spoken
to her-- Lily Cooper.

10:21.820 --> 10:24.744
The one who thinks Mr. Hicks'
employers had him killed?

10:24.790 --> 10:27.156
And the five other homes that
were broken into that night,

10:27.190 --> 10:28.919
they do all that as... cover?

10:30.690 --> 10:32.920
All the break-ins happen
between here and 30th Avenue,

10:32.960 --> 10:34.052
all within a couple of hours.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.159
And there were no witnesses?

10:36.200 --> 10:38.020
The crew that did it got
in and out of the other spots

10:38.070 --> 10:39.799
without running into
any residents-- Hicks was...

10:39.840 --> 10:40.898
unluclq.

10:40.940 --> 10:42.999
I think you're right.

10:43.040 --> 10:44.928
Not about Hicks
being unlucky...

10:44.970 --> 10:48.736
but about the killer not staging
the five other break-ins.

10:48.780 --> 10:51.977
I don't think what happened here
was connected to those.

10:53.450 --> 10:56.146
Look at the last names
of all the other families.

10:56.180 --> 10:57.818
They're all Russian.

10:57.850 --> 11:00.080
There's a lot of Russians
in this neighborhood.

11:00.120 --> 11:02.213
Yes. But if you exclude Hicks,

11:02.260 --> 11:03.818
the crew hit only Russians.

11:03.860 --> 11:05.157
There's a
Russian Orthodox church

11:05.190 --> 11:06.418
just a few blocks away.

11:06.460 --> 11:08.018
And the night of the break-ins

11:08.060 --> 11:10.221
was also the Eve
of the Epiphany.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.897
The what?
If the thieves had

11:11.930 --> 11:14.091
an association with the church,
they would have known

11:14.140 --> 11:15.437
which families were_
attending serwces that night.

11:15.470 --> 11:16.960
That would explain

11:17.010 --> 11:18.864
how they only broke
into homes that were empty.

11:20.740 --> 11:23.300
That's one of the homes
that was hit, right?

11:23.350 --> 11:24.749
Yeah.

11:24.780 --> 11:26.247
And that apartment
and this one

11:26.280 --> 11:28.145
can look right
into each other.

11:28.180 --> 11:29.784
And according to this,

11:29.820 --> 11:32.288
they didn't take very much
from that one.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.117
Maybe because they
left in a hurry.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.412
Because they heard gunshots
coming from over here

11:36.460 --> 11:39.918
and figured... the police
were on their way.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.997
Nobody from that building
saw the shooter coming or going,

11:43.030 --> 11:45.191
but maybe the thieves did.

12:05.420 --> 12:09.186
*

12:16.060 --> 12:18.028
You remember me.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.389
I have nothing to say to you.

12:19.430 --> 12:21.091
Please leave me alone.

12:21.140 --> 12:23.335
I anticipated you
having reservations

12:23.370 --> 12:25.838
about me approaching you
in public-- it might expose

12:25.870 --> 12:26.905
your arrangement
with my father.

12:26.940 --> 12:27.975
That's why I chose

12:28.010 --> 12:29.375
so private a setting.

12:29.410 --> 12:30.900
Don't worry
about the cameras.

12:30.950 --> 12:34.249
I disabled them
a short while ago.

12:37.050 --> 12:40.178
As you may be aware,
there was an attempt on his life

12:40.220 --> 12:42.154
just under two years ago--
I'm trying to ascertain

12:42.190 --> 12:43.885
to what degree the matter
was investigated.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.158
I imagine you are.

12:45.190 --> 12:46.794
Trying to figure out
how much he knows?

12:46.830 --> 12:48.229
I've given up asking
what he knows,

12:48.260 --> 12:49.329
so I'm asking what you know.

12:49.360 --> 12:50.964
Ask someone else.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.161
Mr. Muller, I have friends
here that my father

12:53.200 --> 12:54.292
may be placing in danger.

12:54.340 --> 12:55.898
What is your game?

12:55.940 --> 12:57.464
My "game"?

12:57.510 --> 13:00.104
On second thought,
I don't want to know.

13:00.140 --> 13:01.835
I have a family.

13:01.880 --> 13:03.245
I have a wife.

13:03.280 --> 13:05.168
You and your father
can both go to hell.

13:09.250 --> 13:11.810
BELL: Every family
whose home was hit

13:11.850 --> 13:15.183
had RSVP'd to a dinner
that night at the church.

13:15.220 --> 13:18.587
So we looked at
who had access to those RSVPs.

13:18.630 --> 13:22.225
Turns out the leader
of your little gang-- Roland--

13:22.260 --> 13:23.966
he works for the caterer.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.594
He also had a record,
so we started with him.

13:26.630 --> 13:29.463
He gave the rest
of you up.

13:29.500 --> 13:32.230
He's not "the leader."

13:32.270 --> 13:35.137
No? That's funny--
he definitely described you

13:35.180 --> 13:37.375
as a minor player.

13:37.410 --> 13:39.844
No, seriously--
you should be thanking him.

13:39.880 --> 13:41.211
The only reason

13:41.250 --> 13:43.013
you're sitting here
talking to us,

13:43.050 --> 13:44.142
the only reason the DA

13:44.190 --> 13:46.010
is offering you
a deal and not him,

13:46.050 --> 13:48.382
is that he said you were the one
keeping watch out the window.

13:48.420 --> 13:50.957
See, we're a lot
more interested

13:50.990 --> 13:52.890
in the homicide
you saw across the street

13:52.930 --> 13:54.420
than we are in you.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.423
So Roland would do
more time than me?

13:58.470 --> 14:00.028
Guaranteed.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.002
I was looking
out the window.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.031
There was
a scary looking guy--

14:06.070 --> 14:10.040
(over speaker):
shaved head, Hispanic, tattoos.

14:10.080 --> 14:12.913
Had his gun out like this.

14:12.950 --> 14:16.442
And the other guy's
begging for his life.

14:16.480 --> 14:20.450
And he just plugs him
full of bullets. Pop! Pop!

14:20.490 --> 14:22.117
Pop!
BELL: Okay, first let's get

14:22.160 --> 14:24.082
your hand out of my face.
(phone vibrating)

14:24.130 --> 14:26.348
Then let's back up...
Hey. That lead on the witness

14:26.390 --> 14:28.551
paid off-- he's giving Marcus
a statement right now.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.398
After this, we'll have him
sit down with a sketch artist.

14:31.430 --> 14:32.966
Where are you?

14:33.000 --> 14:33.989
I've returned
to Lily Cooper's office

14:34.040 --> 14:35.564
at the halfway house.

14:35.600 --> 14:38.262
Oh. So once we have a sketch,
I'll forward it to you.

14:38.310 --> 14:40.369
Maybe Lily can identify the guy.

14:40.410 --> 14:43.049
That sketch might be
more important than ever.

14:43.080 --> 14:45.048
Lily won't be
identifying anyone.

14:45.080 --> 14:46.945
I'm here
because one of the detectives

14:46.980 --> 14:48.572
found my card on her desk.

14:48.620 --> 14:50.144
She's been strangled.

14:56.420 --> 14:57.626
Lily Cooper had
a locked strongbox

14:57.660 --> 14:59.059
bolted inside her desk.

14:59.090 --> 15:00.250
It's where her staff
kept contraband

15:00.300 --> 15:01.995
they confiscated from residents.

15:02.030 --> 15:03.998
Staffer who discovered the body
found it like that.

15:04.030 --> 15:05.918
WATSON: Whoever killed
Lily wanted it to look

15:05.970 --> 15:08.063
like it was over
the contents of the box.

15:08.100 --> 15:09.465
And you don't buy it?

15:09.500 --> 15:12.060
When Sherlock and I went
to see her yesterday,

15:12.110 --> 15:13.532
she showed us
a file of case histories

15:13.580 --> 15:15.332
she was about to present
to the DOE.

15:15.380 --> 15:17.075
When Sherlock went
back to her office,

15:17.110 --> 15:18.407
the file was gone.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.145
She thought that
Dennis Hicks was murdered

15:20.180 --> 15:21.943
because he was cooperating
in a case

15:21.980 --> 15:24.187
against Fairbridge University--
we think

15:24.220 --> 15:26.085
she may have been killed
for the same reason.

15:26.120 --> 15:28.281
And Holmes? Where's he?

15:28.320 --> 15:29.617
He's dealing
with a family thing.

15:31.760 --> 15:32.954
So what now?

15:33.000 --> 15:34.319
I take it you have something

15:34.360 --> 15:36.499
more specific in mind
than "arrest a college."

15:36.530 --> 15:38.327
Well, we have
a finest message out

15:38.370 --> 15:39.621
with the sketch of
Dennis Hicks's shooter,

15:39.670 --> 15:42.036
and detectives
are re-canvassmg both scenes.

15:42.070 --> 15:44.163
We'll see if anyone
recognizes the face.

15:44.210 --> 15:46.360
Even though we're pretty sure
he's just a hired gun.

15:46.410 --> 15:48.230
Fairbridge's hired gun?

15:48.280 --> 15:51.499
Well, this is the CEO
of Fairbridge University,

15:51.550 --> 15:54.314
Wilson Trager--
he i the university.

15:54.350 --> 15:55.715
It's privately owned
by him.

15:55.750 --> 15:57.217
No one stands to lose more

15:57.250 --> 15:59.115
if the DOE. rules
against them.

15:59.150 --> 16:01.687
Then I guess I know
your next stop.

16:07.160 --> 16:08.991
MAN :
Detective Bell.

16:09.030 --> 16:10.998
Miss Watson.

16:11.030 --> 16:13.134
Wilson Trager.
Yeah, thanks for seeing us.

16:13.170 --> 16:15.138
Of course.
I assume you're here

16:15.170 --> 16:17.400
because of the murder that took
place a couple of weeks ago.

16:17.440 --> 16:19.135
The poor guy who works
in the call center or something?

16:19.170 --> 16:20.330
His name was

16:20.380 --> 16:22.336
Dennis Hicks--
he was VP of Recruiting.

16:22.380 --> 16:23.404
Right. Sure.

16:23.450 --> 16:24.747
BELL: Actually,

16:24.780 --> 16:26.407
two of your employees
have been murdered.

16:26.450 --> 16:28.441
A woman named Lily Cooper
was killed yesterday.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.584
She was the director
of East River Hope House,

16:30.620 --> 16:32.178
which you own.

16:32.220 --> 16:34.415
Oh, my God, that's... terrible.

16:34.460 --> 16:35.757
We're thinking
there's a connection.

16:35.790 --> 16:38.452
We were hoping we could ask you
a few questions?

16:38.490 --> 16:39.559
Actually,
Mr. Trager was just leaving

16:39.590 --> 16:40.693
for an important meeting.

16:40.730 --> 16:42.152
It can't be rescheduled.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.326
I'm so sorry.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.689
But I've asked Josh and Bill

16:44.730 --> 16:46.220
to help you in any way they can.

16:46.270 --> 16:47.567
Two people now?

16:47.600 --> 16:48.760
I want to know everything.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.108
And, uh...

16:50.140 --> 16:51.300
you know, remind me

16:51.340 --> 16:52.705
to send something
to the families.

16:52.740 --> 16:54.628
Thank you for everything
that you're doing.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.033
Yes, Mr. Trager, we...
Uh, we can

16:56.080 --> 16:57.775
answer your questions.
Please,

16:57.810 --> 17:00.210
right this way.

17:02.280 --> 17:03.781
Can we hang on to this?

17:03.820 --> 17:05.685
We'll show it to Mr. Trager

17:05.720 --> 17:07.517
and obviously let you know
if it sparks anything.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.551
Again, we were hoping
to put our questions

17:09.590 --> 17:11.353
to Mr. Trager ourselves.

17:11.390 --> 17:12.721
And why would that
be necessary?

17:12.760 --> 17:14.125
WATSON:
Because we're trying

17:14.160 --> 17:15.195
to solve two murders,

17:15.230 --> 17:16.595
and both victims were assisting

17:16.630 --> 17:18.825
a D.O.E. investigation
that could cost him millions.

17:18.870 --> 17:20.132
We, ..
Wait.

17:20.170 --> 17:21.831
So... in so many words,

17:21.870 --> 17:23.508
you came here
to accuse Mr. Trager

17:23.540 --> 17:24.837
of hiring an assassin?

17:24.870 --> 17:28.499
"Accuse" is a strong word
at this stage.

17:28.540 --> 17:30.405
But you're hardly here
for a friendly chat.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.805
And you wonder why you're
talking to us instead of him.

17:32.850 --> 17:35.171
Does he have
something to hide?

17:35.220 --> 17:36.539
(soft chuckle)

17:36.580 --> 17:38.138
We'll ask Mr. Trager if he knows

17:38.190 --> 17:40.112
anything about either
of the victims.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.412
Though based on what we
all just saw in the lobby,

17:42.460 --> 17:44.189
I'd say he barely knew
they existed.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.152
As for the DOE.
investigation,

17:46.190 --> 17:48.090
we've got it handled,
I promise you.

17:48.130 --> 17:50.564
But look, uh... you heard
Mr. Trager tell us

17:50.600 --> 17:54.229
to help you in any way we can--
we'll give you full access

17:54.270 --> 17:56.761
to his secretarial staff,
his date book, his computer.

17:56.800 --> 17:59.360
You find any evidence
that he or anyone else here

17:59.410 --> 18:01.731
hired an assassin,
more power to you.

18:13.860 --> 18:16.112
Lukas Muller is in New York.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.151
I paid him a visit yesterday.

18:18.190 --> 18:19.623
Why would you...

18:19.660 --> 18:21.252
I was surprised,
and indeed confused,

18:21.300 --> 18:23.120
by the way that he treated me.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.263
During our one
prior interaction,

18:25.300 --> 18:27.359
I had noticed a baseline
nervousness to the man,

18:27.400 --> 18:29.265
but that could be written off
to Circumstance.

18:29.300 --> 18:30.506
He was, after all,
sharing secrets

18:30.540 --> 18:32.405
which could have cost him
his job.

18:32.440 --> 18:35.170
I'm the son of the man
who lines his pockets,

18:35.210 --> 18:38.407
so yesterday I expected him
to treat me as a friend.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.509
Instead, he treated me
like an enemy.

18:40.550 --> 18:43.212
More precisely,
a threat.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.178
I know, Father.

18:46.220 --> 18:47.710
Know what?

18:47.760 --> 18:50.558
Why you never mentioned
your brush with death.

18:50.590 --> 18:52.581
Why you never asked me,

18:52.630 --> 18:54.848
the finest detective you know,
for assistance.

18:57.200 --> 19:01.193
You believe that I'm the man
who tried to kill you.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.535
It's made me wonder

19:05.570 --> 19:07.800
why you...
really came to New York.

19:07.840 --> 19:10.206
Were you just following up
on your suspicions,

19:10.250 --> 19:12.901
or did you intend to do me harm?

19:14.880 --> 19:17.440
I did, at one time, suspect you.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.709
But I've long since
moved off the notion.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.456
I'm satisfied that
you weren't involved.

19:23.490 --> 19:25.754
Though Muller,
apparently, is not.

19:25.790 --> 19:29.248
You and I have had
our differences...

19:31.330 --> 19:34.231
but I've always thought
that at the very least

19:34.270 --> 19:36.488
you knew the content
of my character.

19:38.670 --> 19:41.275
If you don't know,
without question,

19:41.310 --> 19:43.972
that I'm not a killer...

19:44.010 --> 19:48.777
then there really is no
foundation for us to build on.

19:48.820 --> 19:50.378
This...

19:50.420 --> 19:53.548
experiment of ours
has reached its end.

19:53.590 --> 19:57.424
If for no other reason than to
preserve my safety and Watson's.

19:57.460 --> 19:59.826
I do hope you'll agree.

20:01.560 --> 20:04.620
Oh. And if you have
any lingering doubts,

20:04.670 --> 20:06.820
here's how you can be certain

20:06.870 --> 20:09.839
I'm not the one
who tried to kill you.

20:09.870 --> 20:11.838
You're alive.

20:31.390 --> 20:32.652
(footsteps approaching)

20:32.690 --> 20:34.351
Hey, I didn't you were back.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.027
I was down in my ofﬁce.

20:36.060 --> 20:39.268
That's the honey we got for
your father when he comes over.

20:39.300 --> 20:40.699
So it is.

20:40.740 --> 20:44.938
I guess that means
the conversation went poorly.

20:44.970 --> 20:47.734
I was right-- two years ago
he thought I was behind

20:47.780 --> 20:49.998
his near murder.
And now?

20:50.040 --> 20:52.941
Now, according to him,
I am a former suspect;

20:52.980 --> 20:56.677
I'm not at the center
of an elaborate revenge plot.

20:56.720 --> 20:58.608
You believe him?
I do.

20:58.650 --> 21:01.312
But I also think
I was right two weeks ago.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.850
The matter's not resolved.

21:02.890 --> 21:04.619
The culprit is still at large.

21:04.660 --> 21:06.548
The good news is,

21:06.590 --> 21:08.751
we need no longer fear about
being in Father's proximity,

21:08.800 --> 21:11.724
because we will no longer be
in his proximity.

21:13.030 --> 21:14.839
I'm sorry.

21:14.870 --> 21:17.031
Don't be sorry.
He and I have gone years

21:17.070 --> 21:19.630
without talking in the past;
it's an arrangement that works.

21:19.670 --> 21:22.036
Any luck,
we'll be returning to it soon.

21:22.080 --> 21:24.901
How went your meeting
with Wilson Trager?

21:24.950 --> 21:26.508
It's hard to say.

21:26.550 --> 21:28.370
It was more of a non-meeting
than a meeting.

21:28.420 --> 21:30.388
He blew past us
and stuck us

21:30.420 --> 21:31.648
with a couple of lawyers,
and then

21:31.690 --> 21:33.043
they gave us full access
to his life.

21:33.090 --> 21:34.978
Bank and travel records,
e-mails...

21:35.020 --> 21:36.851
Suggests confidence
we will find nothing.

21:36.890 --> 21:39.051
Well, I've been going
through all of it.

21:39.090 --> 21:40.990
So far, no mysterious
wire transfers

21:41.030 --> 21:43.055
or secret liaisons with hit men.

21:43.100 --> 21:45.796
But that's assuming that Trager
paid for everything himself.

21:45.830 --> 21:47.661
If he used
the college's money,

21:47.700 --> 21:49.793
it could take years
to find the trail.

21:49.840 --> 21:52.638
(phone ringing)

21:52.670 --> 21:54.501
You're on speaker.

21:54.540 --> 21:56.508
GREGSON: That sketch
we've been showing around--

21:56.540 --> 21:58.679
some of the staff
at Lily Cooper's halfway house

21:58.710 --> 22:01.611
I.D.'d the guy-- Victor Nieves.

22:01.650 --> 22:04.084
_ He's an ex-con.
He lived there a few years ago.

22:04.120 --> 22:07.112
His parole officer had
a current address on file.

22:07.150 --> 22:08.708
We know
he's armed and dangerous.

22:08.760 --> 22:11.422
ESU is rolling now.
Marcus is with them.

22:11.460 --> 22:13.951
I'll let you know
if we find anything.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.093
I already told you.

22:16.130 --> 22:18.963
I don't know where Victor is.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.865
All right, well, when was
the last time you saw him?

22:20.900 --> 22:21.889
(sighs)

22:21.940 --> 22:23.134
I don't know.

22:23.170 --> 22:25.058
Two days ago, maybe three?

22:27.140 --> 22:28.971
Mrs. Nieves,

22:29.010 --> 22:32.605
it was raining earlier today,
and those boots are still wet.

22:32.650 --> 22:35.073
Someone other than your husband
leave them here?

22:43.630 --> 22:46.383
(softly):
Please.

22:46.430 --> 22:48.523
He's a good man.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.991
Don't hurt him.

22:52.030 --> 22:53.634
Hey, believe me,

22:53.670 --> 22:55.888
we'd all rather
keep things peaceful.

22:55.940 --> 22:57.862
But I'm not gonna lie to you.

22:57.910 --> 22:59.866
Your husband's in trouble,
and we have to find him,

22:59.910 --> 23:02.731
so the best thing you can do
is help us bring him in.

23:02.780 --> 23:05.340
You have any idea
where he would have gone?

23:09.220 --> 23:10.744
(sighs)

23:12.520 --> 23:13.953
Hey. What's your name?

23:13.990 --> 23:15.457
Mayra.

23:15.490 --> 23:16.787
Mayra?

23:16.820 --> 23:19.050
Castle Kingdom--
I know that place.

23:19.090 --> 23:21.524
My brother and I
used to go there.

23:21.560 --> 23:23.790
You go with your folks?

23:23.830 --> 23:25.661
What happened there?

23:25.700 --> 23:26.724
I fell.

23:26.770 --> 23:27.964
You fell at the park?

23:28.000 --> 23:29.069
Uh-huh.

23:29.100 --> 23:30.192
That's no fun.

23:30.240 --> 23:32.003
Here, let me fix that for you.

23:34.840 --> 23:37.502
That look more than
a day old to you?

23:40.110 --> 23:43.819
Mayra, when were you
at the park?

23:43.850 --> 23:45.488
(phone ringing)

23:45.520 --> 23:46.612
Gregson.

23:46.650 --> 23:47.981
BELL:
Yeah, it's me.

23:48.020 --> 23:49.885
Nieves's little girl
just alibied him

23:49.920 --> 23:52.229
for the second murder--
looks like the whole family was

23:52.260 --> 23:54.751
at an amusement park in South
Jersey yesterday until dark.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.529
The wife won't say either way,

23:56.560 --> 23:58.869
but I found a time stamp receipt
in the trash.

23:58.900 --> 24:00.197
I'm reaching out to the park

24:00.230 --> 24:01.936
to see if they
can pull surveillance.

24:01.970 --> 24:03.904
If the story checks out,
there's no way

24:03.940 --> 24:05.828
Nieves could've killed
Lily Cooper.

24:05.870 --> 24:06.939
That's pretty damn interesting.

24:06.970 --> 24:08.506
How so?

24:08.540 --> 24:10.644
I was about to call you.

24:10.680 --> 24:13.513
Victor Nieves
just showed up here.

24:13.550 --> 24:15.916
Turned himself in.

24:15.950 --> 24:17.815
He just confessed
to both murders.

24:24.690 --> 24:26.226
(knocking)

24:26.260 --> 24:27.989
Hi.

24:28.030 --> 24:29.054
(sighs)

24:29.100 --> 24:31.068
(door closes)

24:31.100 --> 24:32.465
(sighs)

24:34.240 --> 24:36.697
(sighs)

24:36.740 --> 24:38.958
This took some finding on
the part of Lily Cooper's staff,

24:39.010 --> 24:42.878
but, uh... when I explained
what it was for, they obliged.

24:44.010 --> 24:46.547
That supposed
to make me crack?

24:46.580 --> 24:48.946
I already said I killed her.

24:48.980 --> 24:51.289
It's you people
who don't believe it.

24:51.320 --> 24:53.709
Oh, no, we know
you didn't kill her.

24:53.760 --> 24:56.581
We've already established that
at the time of her murder

24:56.620 --> 24:58.087
you were spinning
in an oversized teacup

24:58.130 --> 24:59.620
with your little girl.

25:01.300 --> 25:05.088
No, this photograph's not
for you, it's for me.

25:05.130 --> 25:07.928
I've never been a fan
of cutting deals.

25:07.970 --> 25:10.939
Plea bargains,
reduced sentences, mm-mm.

25:10.970 --> 25:13.530
I think they're
a necessary evil,

25:13.580 --> 25:15.878
a dilution of justice.

25:15.910 --> 25:17.969
I'm especially displeased
when they help murderers.

25:18.010 --> 25:20.570
And I do believe
that you're a murderer.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.212
The ballistics on the weapon

25:22.250 --> 25:23.717
that you surrendered
match the slugs

25:23.750 --> 25:25.308
pulled from Dennis Hicks.

25:25.350 --> 25:27.557
So...

25:27.590 --> 25:29.854
I don't want to help you.

25:29.890 --> 25:31.152
Mm-mm.

25:31.190 --> 25:32.623
But...

25:32.660 --> 25:34.252
she believed
that you were deserving

25:34.300 --> 25:36.598
of other people's help.

25:36.630 --> 25:38.166
She was an exemplary
human being.

25:38.200 --> 25:41.089
So, as I sit here and I've got
to try and persuade you

25:41.140 --> 25:44.064
to give up Wilson Trager
in exchange for a deal...

25:44.110 --> 25:46.032
it just, you know...

25:46.070 --> 25:48.903
helps me to remember her.

25:50.310 --> 25:52.574
Wilson who?

25:54.120 --> 25:57.169
In your parole record,
it seems like you were trying

25:57.220 --> 26:00.656
to walk the straight and narrow
after your release from prison.

26:00.690 --> 26:02.214
You completed
your high school diploma,

26:02.260 --> 26:04.319
you held a steady job,

26:04.360 --> 26:06.954
you enrolled at Fairbridge
to study computers...

26:06.990 --> 26:10.027
took out a student loan
for that. Yep.

26:10.060 --> 26:12.028
How much did you owe?

26:12.070 --> 26:14.891
75 grand.

26:14.940 --> 26:19.036
How much did Trager offer you
to murder Dennis Hicks?

26:19.070 --> 26:21.334
Hicks was my recruiter,
remember?

26:21.380 --> 26:23.371
He talked me
into going to Fairbridge.

26:23.410 --> 26:25.378
Fed me a bunch of lies.

26:25.410 --> 26:26.707
I killed him on my own.

26:26.750 --> 26:28.115
You also confessed

26:28.150 --> 26:31.017
to Lily Cooper's strangulation
on your own?

26:32.250 --> 26:33.808
Trager. ..

26:33.860 --> 26:35.919
paid you to kill Dennis Hicks,

26:35.960 --> 26:37.848
and then he paid you again

26:37.890 --> 26:41.223
to take the fall for
Lily Cooper's strangulation.

26:41.260 --> 26:44.263
Now, assuming that
he contracted that out as well,

26:44.300 --> 26:46.063
you're not only protecting him,

26:46.100 --> 26:49.365
but you're protecting the person
who actually killed her.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.163
Why?

26:52.140 --> 26:54.131
(sighs)

26:54.180 --> 26:56.831
'Cause I'm sure that guy
didn't have no choice, either.

26:58.050 --> 27:00.302
Why on earth
would you think that?

27:03.180 --> 27:04.989
Oh.

27:11.830 --> 27:13.422
Until last night,

27:13.460 --> 27:16.657
we were assuming Wilson Trager
only hired one killer.

27:16.700 --> 27:18.668
But when Victor Nieves'
confession to the murder

27:18.700 --> 27:20.224
of Lily Cooper
was punctured, we realized

27:20.270 --> 27:21.760
that there had to be two.

27:21.800 --> 27:22.835
GREGSON: Do you think
he's part of a team?

27:22.870 --> 27:25.703
More likely a collection

27:25.740 --> 27:27.833
of individuals
with similar problems.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.438
He seemed convinced

27:29.480 --> 27:32.369
he understood the second
killer's Circumstances.

27:32.410 --> 27:36.449
Why? Because he believes their
circumstances to be the same.

27:36.480 --> 27:37.310
WATSON: We've been
through Trager's life

27:37.350 --> 27:38.908
with a fine-tooth comb.

27:38.950 --> 27:40.383
Now, this guy doesn't have

27:40.420 --> 27:42.854
conventional criminal ties,
yet he managed to hire

27:42.890 --> 27:45.051
two different killers
in two weeks.

27:45.090 --> 27:46.387
HOLMES: It's possible
Nieves knows

27:46.430 --> 27:48.398
the identity
of Lily Cooper's murderer,

27:48.430 --> 27:51.263
but I think it's more likely
that he intuitively understood

27:51.300 --> 27:53.860
where Trager found
his second killer.

27:53.900 --> 27:55.868
He's getting them
from his own student rolls.

27:55.900 --> 27:57.265
His perch

27:57.300 --> 27:59.063
atop a for-profit college
gives him access

27:59.110 --> 28:02.807
to a unique list: individuals
who sought to improve

28:02.840 --> 28:05.274
their lot in life-- many of them
with criminal records--

28:05.310 --> 28:06.971
who now, thanks to him,

28:07.010 --> 28:09.717
are buckling under student loans
they cannot repay.

28:09.750 --> 28:11.342
This makes them ripe
for manipulation.

28:11.390 --> 28:13.858
BELL: We started wondering,
maybe these two murders

28:13.890 --> 28:16.154
weren't the only times
he solved his problems this way,

28:16.190 --> 28:17.885
so we_|ooked _
for other SUSplClOUS inCIdents

28:17.930 --> 28:19.227
in his past.

28:19.260 --> 28:21.421
About a year ago,
the college's main campus

28:21.460 --> 28:23.394
was being fined
for safety violations.

28:23.430 --> 28:25.421
The whole thing got dropped

28:25.470 --> 28:28.132
because of a fire in
the building inspector's office.

28:28.170 --> 28:30.058
All the inspection records
were lost,

28:30.100 --> 28:32.136
and the city had to start again.

28:32.170 --> 28:34.730
A year before that,
Trager wanted to buy

28:34.780 --> 28:36.998
a co-op on Central Park South.

28:37.040 --> 28:39.372
For whatever reason, the board
was about to reject him--

28:39.410 --> 28:42.174
until a swing vote was injured
in a hit-and-run.

28:42.220 --> 28:44.780
She resigned her spot, 'cause
she could no longer fulfill

28:44.820 --> 28:46.242
her duties, and the vote went

28:46.290 --> 28:48.417
Trager's way.
WATSON:
Now, if this guy

28:48.460 --> 28:51.020
isn't behind it all, he is
the luckiest innocent bystander

28:51.060 --> 28:52.948
in history.
All right,
say you're right,

28:52.990 --> 28:56.118
say the guy's a gangster,
so how do we prove it?

28:56.160 --> 28:58.162
_ Victor Nieves
isn't gonna help us.

28:58.200 --> 29:00.088
Well, now that we know
what we're looking for,

29:00.130 --> 29:01.495
we can try and identify
other people

29:01.540 --> 29:03.189
that Trager coerced.

29:03.240 --> 29:04.867
Look through
the school's past students

29:04.910 --> 29:06.161
for people who fit the bill:

29:06.210 --> 29:07.973
ex-cons who defaulted
on their loans.

29:08.010 --> 29:10.001
Nieves's priors
were for burglary,

29:10.040 --> 29:12.144
so we're thinking Trager
may have chosen people

29:12.180 --> 29:15.411
based on their skills--
an arsonist for the office fire,

29:15.450 --> 29:17.782
a wheelman
for the hit-and-run.

29:17.820 --> 29:20.141
Nieves won't flip;
maybe someone else will.

29:20.190 --> 29:21.987
Fairbridge University
has got to have what,

29:22.020 --> 29:23.419
20,000 students?

29:23.460 --> 29:25.883
That's got to be hundreds
of ex-cons a year.

29:25.930 --> 29:28.524
You think we're looking
for a needle in a haystack.

29:28.560 --> 29:31.290
We are. Or at least
Watson and Marcus are.

29:32.370 --> 29:34.167
What are you gonna do?

29:34.200 --> 29:35.531
Well, I've always found
the best way

29:35.570 --> 29:37.902
to come at a haystack
is with a pitchfork.

29:37.940 --> 29:40.204
I'll see you on the tee
at 7:00 am.

29:40.240 --> 29:42.333
(chuckles)
You know, I imagined

29:42.380 --> 29:44.041
you'd be the sort
to have a private entrance,

29:44.080 --> 29:46.048
and I'm not disappointed.

29:46.080 --> 29:47.206
Who are you?

29:47.250 --> 29:49.138
Uh, I-I mean you
no physical harm.

29:50.850 --> 29:52.408
I'm a consulting detective.

29:52.450 --> 29:55.157
I believe you brushed off
my partner and her colleague

29:55.190 --> 29:56.817
in the lobby yesterday.

29:56.860 --> 29:59.556
Did their feelings get hurt,
so they sent you?

29:59.590 --> 30:01.455
No one sent me.

30:01.500 --> 30:04.060
I've missed the opportunity
to look you in the eye myself,

30:04.100 --> 30:06.193
and I thought it was time
to rectify that.

30:06.230 --> 30:08.039
Got it.

30:08.070 --> 30:09.935
Drink?

30:12.510 --> 30:13.602
So...

30:13.640 --> 30:15.608
lay it on me.

30:15.640 --> 30:18.074
Come on, I could've yelled
for security

30:18.110 --> 30:19.839
the moment I saw you,
but I didn't.

30:21.020 --> 30:22.373
Humor me.

30:22.420 --> 30:24.615
What do you see?

30:24.650 --> 30:27.016
I see very much
what I expected to see.

30:28.390 --> 30:30.085
A psychopath
with no real human connections,

30:30.120 --> 30:31.621
except for the faades
he maintains for convenience.

30:31.660 --> 30:33.389
A vampire of sorts,

30:33.430 --> 30:36.251
but instead of blood,
you feed on hopes and dreams.

30:36.300 --> 30:37.995
Do one I haven't been called.

30:38.030 --> 30:39.122
(chuckles)

30:39.170 --> 30:40.933
Very well.

30:40.970 --> 30:43.234
You're a double destroyer
of lives.

30:43.270 --> 30:45.101
Once when you wrote people
into debt,

30:45.140 --> 30:46.459
and then again
when you used that debt

30:46.510 --> 30:48.603
to leverage them
into doing your bidding.

30:48.640 --> 30:51.279
Well, I haven't heard that one.

30:51.310 --> 30:53.403
Look, I'm doing

30:53.450 --> 30:55.270
what guys like me
have been doing

30:55.320 --> 30:56.514
since the beginning of time.

30:56.550 --> 30:58.381
Promising people
on that side of the wall

30:58.420 --> 31:00.285
that what I'm selling
will help them get

31:00.320 --> 31:02.356
to this side of the wall.

31:02.390 --> 31:03.550
Why do you care so much?

31:03.590 --> 31:05.126
Wha-wha-what's it to you?

31:05.160 --> 31:06.627
Oh, two people are dead.

31:06.660 --> 31:08.628
That's what it is to me.

31:08.660 --> 31:10.389
I heard somebody confessed
to those killings.

31:10.430 --> 31:12.295
His name is Victor Nieves.

31:12.330 --> 31:14.366
And you'll be hearing his name
at your trial,

31:14.400 --> 31:16.129
because you hired him
to commit one murder

31:16.170 --> 31:18.365
and then take the blame
for another.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.503
Oh, wait, so you,

31:20.540 --> 31:23.577
you think that I wanted
Dennis Hicks murdered

31:23.610 --> 31:25.441
because he was a whistleblower.

31:25.480 --> 31:27.471
Okay, but Lily Cooper?

31:27.510 --> 31:30.172
Why on earth
would I want to hurt her?

31:30.220 --> 31:31.619
She was gathering evidence

31:31.650 --> 31:33.311
to present
to the Department of Education,

31:33.350 --> 31:34.658
a file with a list
of individuals

31:34.690 --> 31:36.510
that Fairbridge University
had deceived.

31:36.560 --> 31:38.482
Ah.

31:38.530 --> 31:41.988
Okay, those guys you just
saw me say goodbye to?

31:42.030 --> 31:44.419
Lead counsel for the DOE.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.620
We just shook hands

31:46.670 --> 31:48.365
on a deal that's been
in the works for a week.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.436
Pay a fine,
support some guidelines

31:50.470 --> 31:51.664
they want to enforce,

31:51.710 --> 31:54.372
and that'll be that.

31:54.410 --> 31:55.604
It amounts to nothing.

31:55.640 --> 31:58.609
So whatever sob story

31:58.650 --> 32:01.278
that woman would present, I,
(chuckles) I didn't care.

32:01.320 --> 32:04.187
I've known this investigation's
going away for days.

32:04.220 --> 32:07.383
I'm sure you'll be
able to confirm that.

32:07.420 --> 32:10.309
Obviously, you, uh,

32:10.360 --> 32:13.284
you know the way out.

32:15.360 --> 32:18.261
Oh, you're back.

32:18.300 --> 32:20.393
Fairbridge University
decided to stop cooperating.

32:20.430 --> 32:22.398
So Marcus and I have been

32:22.440 --> 32:23.998
getting help from the DOE.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.200
We've been _
comparing registration

32:25.240 --> 32:26.605
and student loan records

32:26.640 --> 32:28.198
against their
department's databases.

32:28.240 --> 32:29.434
It's gonna take some time.

32:29.480 --> 32:30.469
Oh, how'd it go

32:30.510 --> 32:31.738
with the haystack?

32:31.780 --> 32:33.304
Trager left me
questioning his motive

32:33.350 --> 32:35.170
for having Lily Cooper killed,

32:35.220 --> 32:38.212
but I'm as convinced as ever
that he did have her killed.

32:38.250 --> 32:39.148
Other than that,
one of his diplomas is fake,

32:39.190 --> 32:41.317
and he's a hunter,
so his lack of empathy

32:41.360 --> 32:43.180
extends beyond bipeds.

32:43.220 --> 32:44.448
(doorbell buzzes)

32:44.490 --> 32:45.582
Expecting someone?

32:45.630 --> 32:47.279
No.

32:47.330 --> 32:49.992
Perhaps I goaded Trager
into sending another assassin.

32:50.030 --> 32:51.463
Seriously?

32:51.500 --> 32:53.468
Look on the bright side--
if one of us survives,

32:53.500 --> 32:56.492
we'll have identified
another needle.

33:08.450 --> 33:10.748
It was true.

33:10.780 --> 33:13.010
What you said before.

33:13.050 --> 33:15.086
I should never have

33:15.120 --> 33:17.509
suspected my own son.

33:18.660 --> 33:20.685
I do know you.

33:20.730 --> 33:25.099
But in my defense,
it was not without reason.

33:25.130 --> 33:28.497
I-I'd like to think
that we had grown

33:28.540 --> 33:30.269
a little closer
these last months to,

33:30.300 --> 33:34.100
to understanding one another
a little better.

33:34.140 --> 33:36.131
Well...

33:36.180 --> 33:39.240
you remember where we were
two years ago.

33:39.280 --> 33:42.670
Not to mention
the decades before.

33:44.150 --> 33:46.414
My investigators

33:46.450 --> 33:47.781
located a Paris cabbie,

33:47.820 --> 33:50.687
who identified you to a tee.

33:50.720 --> 33:53.188
He said he had you as a fare

33:53.230 --> 33:56.256
in the vicinity
on the night of the attack.

33:56.300 --> 33:57.824
You were living
in London at the time,

33:57.860 --> 33:59.589
so it seemed plausible.

33:59.630 --> 34:01.461
Yeah.

34:01.500 --> 34:04.298
Uh, do you think
I would've been as careless

34:04.340 --> 34:07.662
as to allow_a witness
to identify me?

34:07.710 --> 34:09.405
Eventually I asked myself
that very question,

34:09.440 --> 34:11.647
and I concluded
that it was more likely

34:11.680 --> 34:15.138
that he'd been bribed
to throw us off.

34:15.180 --> 34:17.569
Since recanted his tale, has he?

34:17.620 --> 34:20.748
He's proved impossible
to find again.

34:20.790 --> 34:23.315
Now whether this means
that he is dead

34:23.360 --> 34:27.182
or simply vanished,
I, I can't say.

34:27.230 --> 34:30.290
ButI urged my people
to move off you

34:30.330 --> 34:32.161
as a suspect, nonetheless.

34:32.200 --> 34:33.758
Mm-hmm.

34:33.800 --> 34:36.735
Lukas Muller just failed
to get that memo, did he?

34:36.770 --> 34:39.762
Lukas never believed that
I'd stopped suspecting you.

34:39.810 --> 34:43.132
_ He was convinced
it was just my way of,

34:43.180 --> 34:45.603
of sending the eyes
of the law elsewhere,

34:45.650 --> 34:48.118
while I dealt with you myself.

34:48.150 --> 34:51.313
And recently he threatened
to tell you as much.

34:51.350 --> 34:53.409
Right, so then you
threatened him back.

34:53.450 --> 34:56.351
That's why he was
so afraid of me?

34:56.390 --> 34:58.255
It happened that my previous

34:58.290 --> 35:01.794
Interpol contact was murdered.

35:01.830 --> 35:05.163
An agent called Jasper De Clerq.

35:05.200 --> 35:06.895
I told Lukas
I was behind it.

35:06.930 --> 35:08.466
But you weren't.

35:08.500 --> 35:10.593
No.

35:10.640 --> 35:13.359
Uh, you'll understand if I find
your word on the matter

35:13.410 --> 35:15.878
less than reliable?

35:17.540 --> 35:20.600
Well, I hope you'll
take my word on this.

35:20.650 --> 35:24.347
As soon as I stopped
considering you as a suspect,

35:24.390 --> 35:27.917
I realized how terrible it was
that I ever had.

35:27.950 --> 35:30.589
When I heard
about your relapse,

35:30.620 --> 35:34.659
I decided to arrange
an extended stay in New York.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.622
That it was time

35:36.660 --> 35:39.891
to make things right
between us.

35:39.930 --> 35:43.832
And that was always
my only reason for coming.

35:45.270 --> 35:47.238
You've made it clear

35:47.270 --> 35:49.374
you'd like me
to return to London.

35:49.410 --> 35:51.446
And so I shall.

35:54.550 --> 35:56.415
I just wanted you to know.

36:07.230 --> 36:08.697
Are these candidates
for your potential pool

36:08.730 --> 36:10.857
of Wilson Trager's
problem solvers?

36:10.900 --> 36:12.492
Call it a first swing.

36:12.530 --> 36:14.339
I focused on people
who live locally

36:14.370 --> 36:16.895
with criminal records that match
the skills that Trager needed.

36:16.940 --> 36:19.761
Fairbridge students
who defaulted on their loans.

36:19.810 --> 36:22.779
Each packet contains everything
we've gathered for that person.

36:22.810 --> 36:25.779
Rap sheets, parole records,
loan histories from the DOE.

36:25.810 --> 36:27.744
I thought we could
look through them,

36:27.780 --> 36:29.645
and then just
narrow them down from here.

36:29.680 --> 36:31.580
You included Victor Nieves,
I see.

36:31.620 --> 36:33.588
Yeah, he's the only person

36:33.620 --> 36:35.588
that we know for sure.

36:35.620 --> 36:36.985
So I used him as a model
for the profile.

36:37.020 --> 36:38.749
I imagine the file

36:38.790 --> 36:40.428
that disappeared
from Lily Cooper's office

36:40.460 --> 36:42.690
contained many
of these same faces.

36:42.730 --> 36:44.561
Perhaps even Victor Nieves.

36:44.600 --> 36:46.363
It's ironic.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.231
If we're right,

36:48.270 --> 36:50.568
Lily and Trager would've used
much of the same criteria.

36:50.600 --> 36:52.568
One of them to help people.

36:52.610 --> 36:54.931
And the other to exploit them.

37:02.020 --> 37:04.545
Hmm.

37:06.820 --> 37:08.515
Plaid is nice.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.448
Sudden urge to buy a throw?

37:10.490 --> 37:11.752
It's not plaid.

37:11.790 --> 37:12.984
It's tartan.

37:13.030 --> 37:14.725
And I think
this might be the key

37:14.760 --> 37:16.853
to bringing down Wilson Trager.

37:16.900 --> 37:19.460
WOMAN:
Projected demand

37:19.500 --> 37:21.263
over the next five years
has us outgrowing

37:21.300 --> 37:22.494
several of
our satellite campuses.

37:22.540 --> 37:25.407
We're scouting
existing facilities.

37:25.440 --> 37:28.409
But at least one or two will
have to be new construction.

37:29.540 --> 37:30.768
(man coughs)

37:32.910 --> 37:33.945
What the hell is that?

37:33.980 --> 37:35.015
(door opens)

37:35.050 --> 37:37.268
HOLMES: Uh, that's one of mine.

37:37.320 --> 37:38.548
Yeah, um,

37:38.590 --> 37:40.285
your calendar
mentioned this meeting,

37:40.320 --> 37:42.788
so I took the liberty
of preparing my own slideshow.

37:42.820 --> 37:45.288
It's gonna be much
more illuminating, I promise.

37:45.330 --> 37:46.649
Yeah, uh, may I?

37:46.690 --> 37:48.294
Thanks, thank you.

37:48.330 --> 37:51.493
Yes, the face before you
is Claudette Bailey.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.361
Fairbridge University,
class of 2012.

37:53.400 --> 37:54.833
Before that,

37:54.870 --> 37:56.360
she did 31 months for fraud

37:56.400 --> 37:57.628
and destruction of property.

37:57.670 --> 37:59.308
When you sent her

37:59.340 --> 38:02.309
to set fire to the city
building inspector's office,

38:02.340 --> 38:03.773
she posed as one
of the cleaning crew

38:03.810 --> 38:06.301
and disguised her accelerant
as flood cleaner.

38:06.350 --> 38:07.578
When I sent her?

38:07.610 --> 38:09.976
I've no idea who that woman is.

38:10.020 --> 38:11.578
(coworkers murmuring)

38:11.620 --> 38:14.009
This is Joseph DeLuca.

38:14.050 --> 38:16.450
He ran over a board member
in your co-op for you.

38:16.490 --> 38:18.788
All right, everyone out.

38:18.830 --> 38:20.980
I'm having you thrown
out for trespassing.

38:21.030 --> 38:23.749
Oh, security already knows
that we're here.

38:23.800 --> 38:26.462
Detective Bell is showing them
our warrant as we speak.

38:26.500 --> 38:29.594
We just didn't... we just
didn't feel like waiting.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.335
We thought that your staff
deserved to know who

38:31.370 --> 38:32.928
they're working for ASAP.

38:32.970 --> 38:34.870
Victor Nieves.

38:34.910 --> 38:36.468
We've spoken about him,

38:36.510 --> 38:39.001
of course, but now you have
a face to put to the name.

38:39.050 --> 38:41.769
Boyd Erlich,
who at your instructions,

38:41.820 --> 38:45.039
strangled Lily Cooper
with his bare hands.

38:45.090 --> 38:47.479
All right, this is,
this is wonderful theater.

38:47.520 --> 38:49.488
Your imagination
is running wild.

38:49.520 --> 38:51.784
But I can't be connected
to any of these people.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.422
WATSON:
You're wrong about that.

38:53.460 --> 38:55.758
We figured out
how you've been choosing them.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.769
Or more accurately, who has
been choosing them for you.

38:58.800 --> 39:01.018
The collections agent
who was assigned their loans.

39:01.070 --> 39:02.389
HOLMES:
Yesterday, in your office,

39:02.440 --> 39:03.759
I noticed a photograph of you

39:03.800 --> 39:05.563
hunting in Scotland.

39:05.610 --> 39:08.579
I recognized the tartan
worn by your companion

39:08.610 --> 39:10.373
as belonging
to the Mackmain clan.

39:10.410 --> 39:12.378
And judging by the structure
of his facial features,

39:12.410 --> 39:13.946
I took him to be
a relative of your wife.

39:13.980 --> 39:16.414
Later on, I noticed
in Victor Nieves'

39:16.450 --> 39:18.486
loan history that
his collection agent's name

39:18.520 --> 39:20.545
was Bradley Mackmain.

39:20.590 --> 39:22.717
Not a terribly common name,
but it was enough

39:22.760 --> 39:24.921
of a_ coincidence
to merit our attention.

39:24.960 --> 39:26.985
WATSON: So we checked,
and Bradley Mackmain

39:27.030 --> 39:29.692
is your wife's nephew.
He picked the people

39:29.730 --> 39:31.766
to coerce based
on your instructions.

39:31.800 --> 39:34.928
That's why there was never a
paper trail leading back to you.

39:34.970 --> 39:36.062
HOLMES:
You said that we were wrong

39:36.100 --> 39:37.897
about why Lily Cooper
was murdered.

39:37.940 --> 39:39.862
And you spoke the truth.

39:39.910 --> 39:41.707
It wasn't that
her case file would be

39:41.740 --> 39:43.731
so damning
in front of the DOE.

39:43.780 --> 39:46.408
It was that she had
included Victor Nieves,

39:46.450 --> 39:48.077
and noticed
that his defaulted loan

39:48.110 --> 39:50.613
had suddenly started
being paid again.

39:50.650 --> 39:52.538
And Lily genuinely
cared about Victor.

39:52.590 --> 39:55.058
She was worried that he'd gone
back to committing robberies.

39:55.090 --> 39:57.615
So she started
hounding him for answers.

39:57.660 --> 39:59.525
And then she called
Mackmain to confirm

39:59.560 --> 40:02.154
the information was correct,
but she wouldn't let it go.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.725
And she was getting too close.

40:04.770 --> 40:06.726
HOLMES:
How do we know all this?

40:06.770 --> 40:09.159
The police had
a pointed conversation

40:09.200 --> 40:11.668
with Bradley Mackmain.

40:11.710 --> 40:14.634
He seemed remarkably eager
to testify against you

40:14.680 --> 40:15.977
in exchange for a deal.

40:16.010 --> 40:17.739
BELL:
Wilson Trager?

40:17.780 --> 40:19.748
You're under arrest
for the murder of Dennis Hicks

40:19.780 --> 40:21.543
and Lily Cooper.

40:21.580 --> 40:23.548
(coworkers murmuring)

40:26.690 --> 40:28.510
(sighs)

40:31.020 --> 40:32.783
I was gonna order takeout.

40:32.830 --> 40:34.718
Do you have any preferences?

40:37.800 --> 40:40.166
Oh, I didn't realize
someone else was here.

40:40.200 --> 40:41.963
I wasn't.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.968
(footsteps thumping)

40:45.710 --> 40:47.598
I take it that was your friend
from the mercenary group?

40:47.640 --> 40:50.177
You guys went another round?

40:50.210 --> 40:52.804
I needed some information,
and she was able to provide it.

40:52.850 --> 40:54.101
Quid pro quo was in order.

40:54.150 --> 40:56.015
Uh, feel free
to eat without me.

40:56.050 --> 40:58.484
There's somewhere
I need to be.

40:58.520 --> 41:00.511
(sighs)

41:09.160 --> 41:10.650
Sherlock?

41:12.530 --> 41:13.758
Don't get the wrong idea.

41:13.800 --> 41:15.529
I'm not here to stop you
or anything.

41:15.570 --> 41:17.868
I just came here
to give you this.

41:17.900 --> 41:19.936
I did some digging

41:19.970 --> 41:22.029
into the murder
of Jasper De Clerq.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.729
Don't look surprised.

41:23.780 --> 41:25.771
I was quite clear about
my mistrust of your explanation.

41:25.810 --> 41:28.040
And as it turns out,
what you told me

41:28.080 --> 41:29.616
about the murder
of Jasper De Clerq

41:29.650 --> 41:30.776
was not entirely true.

41:30.820 --> 41:33.288
I assure you it was.

41:33.320 --> 41:34.958
You said you had nothing
to do with De Clerq's death.

41:34.990 --> 41:36.218
In point of fact,
De Clerq's death

41:36.260 --> 41:37.887
had everything to do with you.

41:37.920 --> 41:40.229
In there,
you'll find De Clerq's

41:40.260 --> 41:41.921
travel and phone records
in the weeks

41:41.960 --> 41:43.188
leading up to the shooting.

41:43.230 --> 41:44.925
You notice anything about them?

41:44.970 --> 41:46.790
Well...

41:46.830 --> 41:48.730
Tokyo for four days.

41:50.240 --> 41:52.299
Then Riyadh.

41:52.340 --> 41:54.069
Then back to London.

41:55.610 --> 41:57.237
He was everywhere I was.

41:57.280 --> 41:58.907
He was spying on you.

41:58.950 --> 42:00.941
In all likelihood,

42:00.980 --> 42:03.540
keeping his eyes open
for a vulnerable moment.

42:03.580 --> 42:05.616
The timing of De Clerq's murder,

42:05.650 --> 42:07.709
just as your investigation into
the shooting was heating up,

42:07.750 --> 42:10.082
suggests he was killed
to tie up a loose end.

42:10.120 --> 42:13.829
Whoever killed Sabine
and tried to kill me,

42:13.860 --> 42:16.693
De Clerq was working for them.

42:16.730 --> 42:18.618
(sighs)

42:19.800 --> 42:20.789
It's a new clue.

42:20.830 --> 42:22.138
Thank you, son.

42:23.800 --> 42:25.028
You said you were
deliberately fed a false lead

42:25.070 --> 42:27.129
to cast suspicion on me.

42:27.170 --> 42:29.229
That is an affront
to my reputation.

42:29.280 --> 42:31.771
An offense which I cannot abide.

42:31.810 --> 42:33.846
You stay, 90--

42:33.880 --> 42:35.609
I don't care.

42:35.650 --> 42:38.175
But either way,

42:38.220 --> 42:40.313
I'm gonna find and stop
whoever tried to kill you.
