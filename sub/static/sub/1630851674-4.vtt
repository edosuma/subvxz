WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:05.483
<i>Previously on</i> SEAL Team...

00:05.527 --> 00:06.615
Maybe it's time
I come clean to Bravo.

00:06.658 --> 00:07.964
All it takes is

00:08.008 --> 00:11.011
one cake-eater to get a sniff
that you got PTS,

00:11.054 --> 00:12.403
and they'll pull you
from operating.

00:12.447 --> 00:14.057
You have any doubts

00:14.101 --> 00:16.712
about my fitness to operate,
you speak up.

00:16.755 --> 00:19.236
- Bit of a wake-up call.
Are you serious?

00:20.933 --> 00:22.413
I never guessed a man who enjoys

00:22.457 --> 00:24.111
<i>being shot at
would be the world's</i>

00:24.154 --> 00:26.461
<i>-most overprotective father.
- Jason's 20 years of combat.</i>

00:26.504 --> 00:28.637
- Does that
still have you worried?
- Headaches, memory loss.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.465
I hope there's not something
going on inside his head.

00:30.508 --> 00:32.032
Uh, where's that EOD probe
you were using?

00:32.075 --> 00:33.642
I must have left it
back in the minefield.

00:33.685 --> 00:36.601
Beer, mustard, mayo. Mustard.

00:40.649 --> 00:42.651
Easy, pup.

00:42.694 --> 00:45.001
- He's friendly. We think. So...

00:45.045 --> 00:47.090
Brad,
he just has to sniff around,

00:47.134 --> 00:48.570
assert his dominance.

00:48.613 --> 00:51.007
Then let the dog do the same.

00:52.835 --> 00:54.663
She definitely has
her sense of humor

00:54.706 --> 00:56.839
from her dad, right?
I totally get that.

00:56.882 --> 00:58.232
That's funny.
'Cause I'm the funny guy.

00:58.275 --> 01:00.451
- Uh, clearly, sir.

01:00.495 --> 01:03.063
That's for you.

01:06.892 --> 01:08.068
So,

01:08.111 --> 01:10.157
no room service at the hotel,
huh, Brad?

01:10.200 --> 01:11.810
Oh, um...

01:11.854 --> 01:13.682
I think they're still trying
to master running water.

01:13.725 --> 01:16.337
Lucky you,

01:16.380 --> 01:18.034
Em. Get to stay here
for the weekend.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.383
Your futon
is a chiropractor's soul mate.

01:24.475 --> 01:25.868
So, what do you want to do

01:25.911 --> 01:27.130
for the day?
How about we go to the beach?

01:27.174 --> 01:28.349
Yeah.

01:28.392 --> 01:29.524
Oh, wow,
I would've thought BUD/S

01:29.567 --> 01:30.699
ruined the beach for you
for life.

01:32.744 --> 01:35.443
No, but I'm still...
I'm still down, you know?

01:35.486 --> 01:36.966
As-as long as you don't make us

01:37.009 --> 01:38.663
do boat carries again.

01:39.925 --> 01:42.189
You been doing recon on me

01:42.232 --> 01:43.668
since the last time we met?

01:44.930 --> 01:46.932
All right, Cerby, let's go.

01:46.976 --> 01:49.239
Got to go for a walk.

01:49.283 --> 01:50.501
- Come here.
Uh,

01:50.545 --> 01:51.894
you know what, sir?
I'll take Cerby.

01:51.937 --> 01:54.375
It's a chance
for me to win him over.

01:54.418 --> 01:55.767
Whoa. First of all,

01:55.811 --> 01:57.726
you can start by, uh,

01:57.769 --> 02:00.207
calling him
by his proper name, okay?

02:00.250 --> 02:03.471
You haven't earned the right yet
to call him by his nickname.

02:03.514 --> 02:04.863
His name is Cerberus.

02:04.907 --> 02:06.561
- Yes, sir.
- Go ahead, say it. Say it.

02:06.604 --> 02:08.171
- Cerberus.
- Cerberus.

02:08.215 --> 02:09.303
Watch out.

02:09.346 --> 02:10.695
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

02:10.739 --> 02:13.089
- Thank you, sir.
- Mm-hmm.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.178
All right, I'll be back.

02:15.222 --> 02:17.137
Come on, Cerby. Uh, Cerberus.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.835
- Come on.

02:19.878 --> 02:21.053
- Oh, my God.

02:21.097 --> 02:22.620
Be lucky if he comes back

02:22.664 --> 02:25.406
- thanks
to your psychological warfare.
- Hey.

02:25.449 --> 02:28.191
You know what? It's my duty
to terrify your boyfriend.

02:28.235 --> 02:31.542
So? What do you think?

02:31.586 --> 02:33.457
Eh, he seems harmless enough.

02:33.501 --> 02:35.546
He's a great guy.
We've been together

02:35.590 --> 02:36.982
a year and a half.
I want you to like him.

02:37.026 --> 02:38.245
Well, since when do you care
what I think?

02:38.288 --> 02:39.724
With you so involved

02:39.768 --> 02:41.335
in my life,
of course your opinion matters.

02:41.378 --> 02:44.599
More than anyone's in the world.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.475
Gonna be a good day.

02:52.607 --> 02:54.783
Memory aid supplements?

02:54.826 --> 02:56.219
You're taking these?

02:56.263 --> 02:58.178
Yeah. It was a free sample.

02:58.221 --> 02:59.875
Yeah, the, uh, DEVGRU docs

02:59.918 --> 03:01.877
handed them out the other day.

03:01.920 --> 03:05.185
It's the, uh,
ginkgo bilinkgo stuff.

03:05.228 --> 03:08.623
- Supposed to make you sharp.
- Yeah.

03:12.714 --> 03:14.281
We need to start
telling people, right?

03:14.324 --> 03:16.892
Um... Yeah?

03:16.935 --> 03:19.982
I mean, I don't know,
I guess you could just...

03:20.025 --> 03:22.550
post this picture,
letting everyone know.

03:22.593 --> 03:25.422
Okay, maybe, uh, another way.

03:25.466 --> 03:26.989
You know,
one that doesn't involve

03:27.032 --> 03:30.166
Mark Zuckerberg having photos
from inside my body?

03:30.210 --> 03:32.777
Well, Sonny
dropped his baby announcement

03:32.821 --> 03:34.779
five beers deep
right after a murder trial,

03:34.823 --> 03:36.955
- so, you know.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

03:36.999 --> 03:39.088
- No reason
to overthink it. No need.
- No, no, no.

03:39.131 --> 03:41.264
Right, because Sonny
is the shining example

03:41.308 --> 03:43.135
that we should follow
for all life choices.

03:44.180 --> 03:46.269
- Clearly. Right?
- Yeah. Seriously.

03:46.313 --> 03:49.011
- What?
- Dad?

03:50.012 --> 03:51.622
Dad?

03:51.666 --> 03:53.668
Clay.

03:56.932 --> 03:58.934
- Stella, hey.
Hi, Ash.

03:58.977 --> 04:00.283
How are you?

04:00.327 --> 04:02.329
Good. Wow. Oh.

04:02.372 --> 04:04.505
- Hey.
- I didn't, uh... I didn't know
you were in town.

04:04.548 --> 04:06.158
Oh, I'm just blowing through.

04:06.202 --> 04:09.118
Visiting a friend. You know,
you remember Coop, right?

04:09.161 --> 04:11.990
He's got a crappy boat
he wants me to check out.

04:12.034 --> 04:15.167
Hmm. More, uh, more looped in
on Coop's hobbies

04:15.211 --> 04:16.473
than the fact
that we got married.

04:16.517 --> 04:18.214
Married?

04:19.998 --> 04:22.566
Wow, guess I do owe you a call.

04:22.610 --> 04:26.527
Haven't heard from you
in... two years?

04:28.355 --> 04:30.792
Well, let's talk.

04:45.154 --> 04:47.069
Hey, good-looking.
- Hey, baby.

04:48.505 --> 04:50.768
Kids are watching <i>SpongeBob
with headphones,</i>

04:50.812 --> 04:52.901
so you have some quiet
to decompress.

04:52.944 --> 04:54.076
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

04:54.119 --> 04:56.905
I'm good.

04:57.688 --> 04:59.255
Session went well?

04:59.299 --> 05:00.604
It went great.

05:00.648 --> 05:02.867
Therapist said he's seen
a real change in me.

05:02.911 --> 05:05.653
Said I'm carrying myself
a little lighter.

05:05.696 --> 05:07.916
I see it, too.

05:07.959 --> 05:09.396
Well, I guess that's the weight

05:09.439 --> 05:11.746
of five grown frogmen
off my shoulders.

05:11.789 --> 05:15.750
I mean, babe, telling the team
about my PTS last month,

05:15.793 --> 05:17.317
how they accepted it,

05:17.360 --> 05:19.928
just didn't realize how good
that would make me feel.

05:19.971 --> 05:22.234
You showed them
how much you trusted them.

05:22.278 --> 05:23.845
You spoke your truth.

05:23.888 --> 05:26.456
Honesty is undefeated.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.590
Lord knows I've gone
a few bloody rounds with it,

05:29.633 --> 05:31.156
but you are right.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.115
- As usual.

05:33.158 --> 05:35.117
So, uh,

05:35.160 --> 05:37.249
those headphones
the kids are wearing,

05:37.293 --> 05:38.642
are they
the noise-canceling kind?

05:38.686 --> 05:40.165
Oh, nice try.

05:40.209 --> 05:42.516
- Was it?
- Yeah.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.130
Hey, Hannah.

05:48.173 --> 05:50.959
I-I just was looking
at the-the monitor,

05:51.002 --> 05:54.179
and-and I saw that, um, she
didn't have her froggy blanket.

05:55.006 --> 05:57.444
Yeah, I just...
You know, I-I was just worried

05:57.487 --> 06:00.316
if she-she's gonna wake up
and-and be upset.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.710
You know how she is.

06:02.753 --> 06:05.321
Uh, if that's in the wash...

06:05.365 --> 06:07.367
You know, um, remember, uh,

06:07.410 --> 06:10.979
two is one, and...
and one is none.

06:14.417 --> 06:17.420
Wait, wait, what-what
do you mean, "false alarms"?

06:17.464 --> 06:20.858
Oh, oh, she-she doesn't have
the mumps.

06:21.598 --> 06:23.731
I guess it's just hard to,
you know, get the bigger picture

06:23.774 --> 06:26.690
while you're staring
through a two-inch monitor.

06:26.734 --> 06:28.126
You're right.

06:28.170 --> 06:30.825
You're right. I'll...
I will throttle back

06:30.868 --> 06:33.610
on the helicopter parenting.

06:33.654 --> 06:36.091
Okay. All right.

06:36.134 --> 06:37.875
Have a good night.

06:42.053 --> 06:43.533
<i>The ceremony</i>

06:43.577 --> 06:44.665
was just the two of us.

06:44.708 --> 06:47.015
Uh, really spontaneous.

06:47.058 --> 06:49.757
Spontaneous is good.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.368
People get bogged down
with plans and expectations.

06:52.412 --> 06:56.241
Learned the cost
of expectations years ago.

06:57.373 --> 06:59.375
So, uh, did you ever get back

06:59.419 --> 07:01.377
into that TBI crusade
we were involved in?

07:01.421 --> 07:03.379
We were making
some headway there

07:03.423 --> 07:05.163
before you started
waving around that white flag.

07:05.207 --> 07:08.384
I didn't wave any flag.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.430
More like handed it off to you.

07:11.996 --> 07:13.650
That's too bad.

07:13.694 --> 07:15.870
Thought we were on the brink
of something really cool there,

07:15.913 --> 07:17.262
and it just vanished.

07:17.306 --> 07:20.222
Feels like a pattern with us.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.622
- Oh.
- Wow.

07:28.665 --> 07:31.451
Y'all didn't waste any time
after the wedding, did you?

07:31.494 --> 07:32.713
Um...

07:32.756 --> 07:35.237
Yeah, you're-you're actually
the first person

07:35.280 --> 07:37.239
that we've, uh, that we've told.

07:37.282 --> 07:38.545
Well, you didn't <i>tell</i> me.

07:38.588 --> 07:40.242
- But I am honored.

07:40.285 --> 07:42.549
So, when-when you gonna have it?

07:42.592 --> 07:45.073
Uh, I'm-I'm due February.

07:47.162 --> 07:48.903
I'm gonna be a grandpa.

07:48.946 --> 07:50.339
- Wow.

07:50.382 --> 07:51.906
If it's a little boy,
I'll take him fishing.

07:51.949 --> 07:54.604
I can teach him that spin cast
like I taught Clay.

07:54.648 --> 07:56.650
- You can do that
with a girl, too.
- Yeah, I would argue that.

07:56.693 --> 07:58.956
Have you ever seen
a little girl spin cast?

08:02.090 --> 08:03.395
No.

08:03.439 --> 08:05.441
You don't get to do that.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.530
Look, you can use me and
my career for your purposes,

08:07.574 --> 08:09.184
but not my child.

08:14.406 --> 08:16.017
It's good to see you, Stella.

08:17.714 --> 08:21.065
Congrats on the little guy.

08:24.852 --> 08:27.507
That wasn't very nice, babe.

08:32.686 --> 08:34.122
Hey.

08:34.905 --> 08:37.778
Look, you made your point.
Just cease fire, all right?

08:37.821 --> 08:39.214
Get that worked up
over a grandkid,

08:39.257 --> 08:41.259
but you just ghosted
your own son for years.

08:42.043 --> 08:43.827
You once told me
you joined the teams

08:43.871 --> 08:47.178
so you could erase my footsteps,
not follow in them.

08:47.222 --> 08:50.442
Now you get a chance
to do that as a dad.

08:52.009 --> 08:54.621
Hey. Dad, you're bleeding.

08:54.664 --> 08:56.187
Is that a PICC line?

08:56.231 --> 08:57.754
It's nothing.

08:57.798 --> 08:59.495
Is it for an IV?

09:01.715 --> 09:02.977
Chemo?

09:03.020 --> 09:04.544
I can handle it.

09:06.023 --> 09:08.286
I don't need anything
from you, Clay.

09:08.330 --> 09:11.463
Especially sympathy.
It turns my stomach.

09:15.598 --> 09:17.426
How bad is it?

09:21.648 --> 09:24.694
Take care of your wife
and your kid, son.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.572
You okay?

09:35.575 --> 09:37.272
I don't know.

09:43.104 --> 09:44.714
The drive from D.C. is no joke.

09:44.758 --> 09:46.629
- Mm.
- Can't believe you make
that trip every week.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.413
Yeah, but, you know,
the opportunity

09:48.457 --> 09:50.415
like the DoD Fellowship
is worth it.

09:50.459 --> 09:53.244
But, you know, with this,
uh, white paper assignment,

09:53.288 --> 09:55.595
"opportunity"
has suddenly become "homework."

09:55.638 --> 09:57.901
Strike me as the type
who never minded homework.

09:57.945 --> 09:59.511
Says the man with how many

09:59.555 --> 10:01.035
- postgrad degrees?

10:01.078 --> 10:02.645
Right. One more, and my elbows

10:02.689 --> 10:04.604
- sprout
their own leather patches.

10:04.647 --> 10:06.910
- Okay, so, Grant,

10:06.954 --> 10:10.392
since you are the seasoned pro,

10:10.435 --> 10:13.917
what should I possibly write
my 50-page analysis on?

10:13.961 --> 10:15.440
You're the only one in the group

10:15.484 --> 10:17.138
- who has
actual military experience.
- Mm-hmm.

10:17.181 --> 10:18.661
Gives you a unique perspective.

10:18.705 --> 10:22.709
Feels like tunnel vision
sometimes, you know?

10:22.752 --> 10:25.276
They call it, um,

10:25.320 --> 10:27.148
three-foot world.

10:27.191 --> 10:29.280
So, you become so focused
on the task at hand,

10:29.324 --> 10:30.804
the people
that you're responsible for,

10:30.847 --> 10:34.155
that the rest of the world
just goes dark.

10:34.198 --> 10:35.939
That's intense.

10:35.983 --> 10:37.419
I can relate.

10:37.462 --> 10:38.681
Sometimes, I leave work early

10:38.725 --> 10:40.030
but keep my sport coat
on my chair

10:40.074 --> 10:41.510
so people think I'm still there.

10:41.553 --> 10:42.903
Total badass.

10:42.946 --> 10:44.600
Okay.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.777
- Well, that's funny.
It's not exactly helpful.
- Right.

10:47.821 --> 10:49.866
- The search for a thesis topic.
- Yes.

10:49.910 --> 10:52.086
You just called the Fellowship
an opportunity.

10:52.129 --> 10:54.654
- Mm-hmm.
- To do what?

10:54.697 --> 10:57.482
Hmm. Um...

10:57.526 --> 11:00.007
To add something to my résumé

11:00.050 --> 11:03.358
that could distinguish me
for promotion within SOCOM.

11:04.141 --> 11:05.752
Beyond that, um...

11:05.795 --> 11:08.319
I'm hoping that it opens up
my world a little.

11:08.363 --> 11:11.801
You know, shows me
some new possibilities.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.674
Is that happening?

11:14.717 --> 11:16.501
I think it is.

11:21.028 --> 11:22.333
Here you go.

11:36.521 --> 11:38.219
♪ <i>Could not explain</i>♪

11:38.262 --> 11:42.527
♪ <i>The wait that I was on</i>♪

11:46.270 --> 11:49.012

12:04.071 --> 12:05.420
Look at this.

12:18.781 --> 12:21.001
Hey, I'm so sorry.

12:21.044 --> 12:22.219
I got to go to work. Uh...

12:22.263 --> 12:24.482
Yeah. I'll talk to you later.

12:30.140 --> 12:32.360
Cerby, sit. Hey, buddy.

12:32.403 --> 12:34.231
Hey. Oh, no, no, no.

12:34.275 --> 12:35.580
Ah. Sorry, I got to...

12:35.624 --> 12:37.800
Okay, let's go. Off. Got to go.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.193
Well, we get it.

12:39.236 --> 12:41.761
The stuff on the news
looks really bad.

12:41.804 --> 12:44.502
Looks like it's, uh,
gonna be a while,

12:44.546 --> 12:46.853
so have a safe trip back,
you understand? Okay?

12:46.896 --> 12:49.072
- You be good.
I love you. All right?
Love you.

12:49.116 --> 12:51.422
Yeah. Brad.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.731
Uh, Mr. Hayes,

12:55.775 --> 12:57.428
there's something that I--
well, we--

12:57.472 --> 12:59.082
wanted to talk to you about
in person.

12:59.126 --> 13:01.911
And, you know, I just... I don't
know when I'll see you again.

13:01.955 --> 13:03.826
Now what?

13:03.870 --> 13:07.308
- We want to move in together.
That's funny.

13:07.351 --> 13:08.831
- We're serious.
Serious.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.920
Okay, Mr. and Mrs. Serious,
I'll tell you what.

13:10.964 --> 13:12.966
Huh? Finish school,

13:13.009 --> 13:14.794
- then you can think
about that kind of stuff.
- Oh, well,

13:14.837 --> 13:16.360
that's the thing, sir.
I'm already a year ahead,

13:16.404 --> 13:17.840
- so I'm about to finish.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.320
- And I was thinking we could...
Stop.

13:19.363 --> 13:22.497
Okay? You find a job,
you graduate,

13:22.540 --> 13:24.542
and then we can talk
about this kind of stuff.

13:24.586 --> 13:26.588
- Dad.
- Well, I'm not looking
for a job, sir.

13:26.631 --> 13:29.243
I've already enlisted.

13:29.286 --> 13:30.635
Enlisted?

13:30.679 --> 13:33.203
Yes, sir. The Navy.
I want to be a SEAL.

13:33.247 --> 13:34.944
Oh, God.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.686
He leaves for boot camp
in six months.

13:37.729 --> 13:40.036
We want to be together
as much as possible until then.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.951
I mean, his apartment

13:41.995 --> 13:44.475
- is nice...
- Okay, stop. It's great this kid
can have his delusions,

13:44.519 --> 13:45.825
all right,
about what he wants to do

13:45.868 --> 13:47.217
with himself in the future,

13:47.261 --> 13:48.871
but we are not gonna let it

13:48.915 --> 13:50.568
screw up your life right now,
you understand me? I'm the one

13:50.612 --> 13:53.267
who strokes the checks,
so the answer is no.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.934
All right,
you've all seen the news.

14:07.977 --> 14:09.674
Two hours ago,

14:09.718 --> 14:13.156
three tourist destinations
in West Africa

14:13.200 --> 14:16.159
were hit by simultaneous
suicide bomb attacks.

14:16.203 --> 14:18.509
Among the over 300 killed,

14:18.553 --> 14:21.208
there were citizens
of 18 nations,

14:21.251 --> 14:22.731
including 20 Americans.

14:22.774 --> 14:24.124
This is an act of terror

14:24.167 --> 14:26.126
on a scale
we haven't seen in years.

14:26.169 --> 14:27.954
The group
claiming responsibility

14:27.997 --> 14:29.956
is the Sahaba of Greater Sahel.

14:29.999 --> 14:31.522
Latter-day ISIS disciples

14:31.566 --> 14:33.307
who have been making
a bloody sweep

14:33.350 --> 14:36.484
through Mali and Burkina Faso
over the past six months,

14:36.527 --> 14:39.313
seizing land and infrastructure.

14:39.356 --> 14:43.317
By all estimations,
SGS has supplanted Boko Haram

14:43.360 --> 14:45.797
as the most powerful
terrorist force in the region.

14:45.841 --> 14:47.321
Spent months fighting Boko
last deployment,

14:47.364 --> 14:48.757
barely made a dent.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.498
This group went in there
and did what we couldn't?

14:50.541 --> 14:52.369
Or did we just soften Boko up
for these guys?

14:52.413 --> 14:54.154
Hand to God,

14:54.197 --> 14:55.459
we end up on a damn boat,

14:55.503 --> 14:56.896
this is gonna be
the last you see of me.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.636
U.S. SOCOM is determined
to respond

14:58.680 --> 15:01.161
to the attacks with immediate
and emphatic action,

15:01.204 --> 15:03.163
deploying teams to three A.O.s

15:03.206 --> 15:05.469
where the SGS leadership
resides.

15:05.513 --> 15:07.515
Going all in and straight
for the aces and kings, huh?

15:07.558 --> 15:09.299
Yeah, and decapitate the snake,
slip out

15:09.343 --> 15:11.780
- before anybody
knows we were there.
- Hey, one-night stand

15:11.823 --> 15:15.305
is just fine with me. Wham, bam,
glad it's not Afghanistan.

15:15.349 --> 15:17.264
All right, Lieutenant Soto
has been deployed

15:17.307 --> 15:19.266
to aid a joint task force
in Mali

15:19.309 --> 15:22.008
while Bravo will be deployed
to Burkina Faso.

15:22.051 --> 15:25.925
Agency Intel will be dealing
target packages very quickly.

15:25.968 --> 15:28.275
Bravo will be operating
out of a temporary outpost

15:28.318 --> 15:30.930
that's being set up
50 kilometers from the capital.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.932
In Soto's absence,
Warrant Officer Perry

15:32.975 --> 15:36.022
will be Bravo's
acting officer in charge.

15:37.327 --> 15:38.676
All right.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.243
Clock's ticking.
Wheels up in an hour.

15:40.287 --> 15:41.984
We'll hit 'em hard and fast.
That's what we do best,

15:42.028 --> 15:44.552
- right, boys?
- Yeah, buddy.

15:46.771 --> 15:48.730
World's on fire again.

15:48.773 --> 15:50.427
Yeah.
It's on fire,

15:50.471 --> 15:52.473
and it's our job to put it out.
That's what Bravo does, man.

15:52.516 --> 15:53.604
- We got this.
- All right. Well,

15:53.648 --> 15:55.084
I need to talk to you about Ray.

15:55.128 --> 15:57.391
- What about Ray?
- Well, without Lieutenant Soto,

15:57.434 --> 15:59.959
puts a lot of weight
on his shoulders as OIC.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.177
Ray's gonna be fine.

16:01.221 --> 16:02.744
He can handle it.
I'll make sure of that.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.659
Well, his track record
as OIC's been rough.

16:04.702 --> 16:06.835
I mean,
one op got him kidnapped.

16:06.878 --> 16:08.619
The other put you on trial.

16:08.663 --> 16:11.709
Ray's good, man.
You know that. Come on.

16:11.753 --> 16:13.885
What's this all about?

16:13.929 --> 16:16.627
Well, there are murmurs
among Command

16:16.671 --> 16:18.281
about Ray's last deployment.

16:18.325 --> 16:21.589
"Dangerously erratic behavior"
was the phrase I heard.

16:21.632 --> 16:23.591
Heard from who?
Who's saying this?

16:23.634 --> 16:25.636
I don't know who the source is,

16:25.680 --> 16:28.944
and, hell,
I couldn't tell you if I did.

16:28.988 --> 16:32.817
But if they're lying,
then you should speak up.

16:38.171 --> 16:39.476
I trust Ray with my life.

16:39.520 --> 16:42.131
Wouldn't be rolling with him
if I didn't.

16:42.175 --> 16:43.741
Well, you know that I prefer

16:43.785 --> 16:45.395
to let Bravo hammer out
its own issues,

16:45.439 --> 16:48.659
but there are some in Command
who may take a harder line.

16:48.703 --> 16:51.619
Just wanted to make you aware.

17:23.216 --> 17:25.305
- Oh.
- Yeah.

17:25.348 --> 17:30.397
How'd the, uh, visit
with Emma and the boyfriend go?

17:30.440 --> 17:32.486
Meant to offer you
some of my Zen techniques.

17:32.529 --> 17:34.749
Mm. You know,
it didn't end great.

17:34.792 --> 17:36.881
Could've gone worse,
but, you know, I fixed it.

17:36.925 --> 17:39.101
You got saved by a spin-up.

17:40.537 --> 17:42.235
Yeah, this one should be good
for all of us.

17:42.278 --> 17:45.064
After all that sneaking
and creeping in North Korea,

17:45.107 --> 17:48.023
some door-kicking will be
a welcome reset for Bravo.

17:48.980 --> 17:51.244
Yeah, fastball
straight down the middle.

17:51.287 --> 17:52.636
Team will crush it, huh?

17:52.680 --> 17:54.595
- Mm-hmm.
- Make our OIC look good.

17:54.638 --> 17:56.423
Yeah, come on, man.

17:56.466 --> 17:58.207
The title
doesn't change anything.

17:58.251 --> 18:00.644
I just want to operate
how we always have.

18:01.863 --> 18:04.039
Yeah, you and me both.

18:04.779 --> 18:07.086
There a reason why we can't?

18:08.826 --> 18:10.524
Come on, Jace.
I've been real honest

18:10.567 --> 18:12.091
with everyone lately. I...

18:12.134 --> 18:13.875
Don't hold back.

18:17.444 --> 18:19.402
Look, Ray, uh...

18:19.446 --> 18:21.709
Command knows.

18:22.797 --> 18:27.062
They know what happened
with you in Nigeria.

18:28.063 --> 18:29.760
My PTS?

18:29.804 --> 18:32.763
I don't know. Someone talked.

18:36.941 --> 18:40.641
Uh, no. No, that's-that's
what I told the guys to do.

18:40.684 --> 18:43.600
I said if they had
any doubts about me,

18:43.644 --> 18:45.167
they should go talk to Command.

18:45.211 --> 18:47.561
That doesn't mean
it was somebody from Bravo, Ray.

18:47.604 --> 18:48.997
Could've been anyone.

18:49.780 --> 18:51.260
Damn.

18:51.304 --> 18:54.045
So, what do I do now?

18:54.089 --> 18:57.571
You stay front-sight focused,
that's what you do.

18:57.614 --> 19:00.400
And if the brass
does have eyes on you,

19:00.443 --> 19:01.923
got to go in and crush that op.

19:01.966 --> 19:04.404
Bravo Team, we got your six.

19:18.374 --> 19:20.942
Why the hangdog?

19:22.596 --> 19:24.554
Not an ideal time to spin up.

19:24.598 --> 19:26.252
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe if we see

19:26.295 --> 19:28.993
an alien encounter,
it'll make up for it.

19:29.777 --> 19:32.736
What the hell
are you talking about?

19:32.780 --> 19:35.913
Dogon people from this region

19:35.957 --> 19:38.525
are descendants
of extraterrestrials.

19:38.568 --> 19:40.004
Okay? So,
if they want to show up

19:40.048 --> 19:42.920
and have a little family reunion
while we're there,

19:42.964 --> 19:45.967
well, that makes up for us...

19:46.010 --> 19:48.709
not seeing a rhino
on this deployment.

19:50.276 --> 19:52.495
Since when are you an expert
on Burkina Faso?

19:52.539 --> 19:56.891
- Or aliens?
- Well, since I got
a lot of time on my hands

19:56.934 --> 20:00.634
since I got stood up
at the Bulkhead.

20:02.244 --> 20:04.594
Yeah, sorry about that.

20:04.638 --> 20:07.597
Yeah, it's no big thing.
Didn't last long.

20:07.641 --> 20:11.775
Did you, uh, you get tossed
for relieving yourself

20:11.819 --> 20:14.909
- under the bar again?
Yes,

20:14.952 --> 20:18.695
vomiting was
my closest bodily function.

20:18.739 --> 20:20.915
No, I just...

20:20.958 --> 20:24.788
saw Davis with this other guy.

20:24.832 --> 20:27.313
- Yeah.
- Got to sting.

20:27.356 --> 20:28.792
Eh.

20:28.836 --> 20:30.968
As much as, uh,

20:31.012 --> 20:33.710
it takes a global catastrophe

20:33.754 --> 20:36.539
for us to, you know,

20:36.583 --> 20:38.802
get to hang anymore.

20:38.846 --> 20:40.543
Yeah.

20:40.587 --> 20:42.893
Look, man, something...

20:42.937 --> 20:45.156
Something came up back home.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.593
Oh, really?

20:46.636 --> 20:49.117
What, did one of your
his-and-hers latte cups break?

20:49.160 --> 20:52.251
Or did you have
a little decorative soap crisis?

20:52.294 --> 20:55.689
It's a little more complicated.

20:57.517 --> 20:59.083
Uh...

20:59.127 --> 21:01.521
Okay.

21:01.564 --> 21:04.175
That's cool. Shut me out.

21:05.699 --> 21:07.614
Outside looking in is, uh...

21:07.657 --> 21:10.225
Seems to be my place these days.

21:11.661 --> 21:13.184
- How's that?
- Oh,

21:13.228 --> 21:16.187
I see my kid
through a grainy camera.

21:16.231 --> 21:19.234
I see others moving on
with their lives.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.410
Everything's changed, you know?

21:21.454 --> 21:24.892
That's the one beautiful thing
about this job.

21:26.459 --> 21:30.854
The war on terror
always stays the same.

22:04.279 --> 22:06.760
This place got up and running
awful quick.

22:06.803 --> 22:08.979
Doesn't look temporary at all.

22:09.023 --> 22:11.286
They've been here a minute,
putting down stakes.

22:11.330 --> 22:14.637
Stakes? They got
a whole combat big top here.

22:14.681 --> 22:15.943
Forget a one-night stand.

22:15.986 --> 22:17.423
Someone's looking
to get hitched.

22:17.466 --> 22:19.033
That's what happens
when the Agency takes over.

22:19.076 --> 22:20.991
Temporary becomes permanent.

22:21.035 --> 22:23.385
- War on terror, boys.
- War on terror.

22:23.429 --> 22:25.648
They got their own
trained animals here.

22:25.692 --> 22:27.302
Ground Branch Task Force?

22:27.346 --> 22:31.350
Yeah, our, uh,
spooky CIA stepbrothers.

22:32.133 --> 22:33.656
All the action,
none of the accountability.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.963
Doesn't change our deal.
Our mission's our mission.

22:36.006 --> 22:38.357
I just didn't expect there to be
so much of a footprint already.

22:38.400 --> 22:42.186
Feels less tip of the spear
than late to the party.

22:43.013 --> 22:45.320
We here for an op or a war?

22:46.060 --> 22:47.453
Come on, Ray. Stop playing.

22:47.496 --> 22:49.672
"Come on, Ray. Stop playing."

22:49.716 --> 22:51.065
What the hell?

22:51.108 --> 22:53.154
The official language here
is French.

22:53.197 --> 22:54.503
I'd rather take
that frog cuisine

22:54.547 --> 22:56.070
than this rabbit food.

22:56.113 --> 22:57.767
I have fresh produce
stocked daily

22:57.811 --> 22:58.942
from local farms.

22:58.986 --> 23:01.162
Helps foster regional goodwill.

23:01.205 --> 23:02.990
Warrant Officer Perry.

23:03.033 --> 23:05.035
That's right.
This is Bravo Team

23:05.079 --> 23:07.516
and our team leader,
Jason Hayes.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.953
Carl Dryden,
Agency Chief of Station.

23:09.997 --> 23:11.302
Welcome to Burkina Faso.

23:11.346 --> 23:12.608
Place is buzzing only

23:12.652 --> 23:13.740
a day after the attacks.

23:13.783 --> 23:15.089
How long you been in-country?

23:15.132 --> 23:16.525
SGS's attacks yesterday

23:16.569 --> 23:18.179
were the culmination
of red flags

23:18.222 --> 23:19.702
I've been warning
the beltway about for months.

23:19.746 --> 23:21.487
We're making up for lost time
combatting this network.

23:22.488 --> 23:24.054
Where are you on
target packages?

23:25.404 --> 23:26.622
Settle in.

23:26.666 --> 23:27.797
If you require anything,

23:27.841 --> 23:30.321
I'm the one to ask.

23:33.324 --> 23:35.849
He's got "need to know"
inked across his back.

23:35.892 --> 23:37.894
Yep. I seen, uh,

23:37.938 --> 23:40.810
meth-dealing grizzly bears
that are less territorial.

23:40.854 --> 23:42.159
Look, I had
a Chief of Station once, man,

23:42.203 --> 23:43.900
in the early days
in Afghanistan.

23:43.944 --> 23:45.511
I wanted toilet paper,
I literally had to tell him

23:45.554 --> 23:46.773
how many sheets I wanted.

23:46.816 --> 23:48.949
No, I'm serious.
Dead serious.

23:48.992 --> 23:50.603
That suggests the type of vision

23:50.646 --> 23:52.256
that takes a targeted strike,
turns it into a forever war.

23:53.649 --> 23:57.218
Never known Jason Hayes
to be a story stealer.

23:58.262 --> 23:59.873
Guzo told us about
the toilet paper guy.

23:59.916 --> 24:01.265
You know that didn't happen
to you.

24:03.529 --> 24:05.922
No, you know, I just didn't
want to mention Guzo's name,

24:05.966 --> 24:08.185
bring the team down, that's all.

24:09.622 --> 24:12.146
Listen, do me a favor,
don't mention this to Spenser.

24:12.189 --> 24:15.323
Really don't need him thinking
I'm stealing Guzo's stories now.

24:15.366 --> 24:16.977
Ah, copy that.

24:17.020 --> 24:18.587
Young gun doesn't need
any more ammo

24:18.631 --> 24:20.502
- for us old-heads, right?
- Mm-hmm.

24:20.546 --> 24:24.027
Looks like we're both watching
our backs these days.

24:42.263 --> 24:46.093
Davis. Hey, you doing okay?

24:46.136 --> 24:47.964
Oh, I'm just shaking off
the frostbite

24:48.008 --> 24:50.314
from the Agency Intel
folks' welcome.

24:50.358 --> 24:51.272
Yeah.

24:51.315 --> 24:52.403
You know, my job is hard enough

24:52.447 --> 24:54.057
without having to beg
for information.

24:55.363 --> 24:58.061
Speaking of which, we, uh...

24:58.105 --> 25:00.760
haven't caught up in a while.

25:00.803 --> 25:02.152
What's new?

25:02.631 --> 25:04.111
Well, I have been busy.

25:04.154 --> 25:05.939
- Mm-hmm, you been busy.
- Yeah. Been going up

25:05.982 --> 25:08.507
to D.C. every week
for this DoD Fellowship.

25:08.550 --> 25:12.075
Busy enough to, uh, do a little
day-drinking at the Bulkhead?

25:12.119 --> 25:14.774
- Huh? Ooh, I saw you.
- That was just a lunch.

25:14.817 --> 25:16.558
- Oh, it was a lunch.
- It was a working lunch.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.908
- Oh, and this
pleated pant fellow...
- Oh, my God.

25:18.952 --> 25:21.607
He's someone
that you're just working with?

25:21.650 --> 25:23.304
He's in the Fellowship, too.

25:23.347 --> 25:25.959
- Sonny...
- Yeah.

25:26.002 --> 25:28.483
You know, everything that
happened with us last year...

25:28.527 --> 25:29.702
Mm-hmm.

25:29.745 --> 25:32.792
...and the job I lost...

25:32.835 --> 25:36.926
this program is helping me
turn the page.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.365
Hmm.

25:44.107 --> 25:45.979
On to the next one, then, huh?

25:46.022 --> 25:48.590
It wasn't a date, Sonny.

25:48.634 --> 25:50.244
- Mm-hmm.
- And...

25:50.287 --> 25:52.681
...at some point,
for the both of us,

25:52.725 --> 25:55.336
it will be.

25:55.379 --> 25:58.295
We just can't sit around
licking our wounds forever.

26:00.471 --> 26:02.778
Sorry.

26:02.822 --> 26:05.476
Davis.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.653
Copy. Yeah, be right there.

26:07.696 --> 26:09.132
Apparently,
there's a target package

26:09.176 --> 26:11.352
ready to go.
News to me.

26:11.395 --> 26:13.876
No fun being left behind.

26:17.880 --> 26:20.013
- Davis, what do we have?
- Wish I knew.

26:20.056 --> 26:22.189
- They didn't read you in?

26:22.232 --> 26:23.843
I know you're all
just getting your bearings,

26:23.886 --> 26:25.845
but this package
is time sensitive, so...

26:25.888 --> 26:27.977
need you to roll on it ASAP.

26:28.021 --> 26:29.849
We've confirmed the location

26:29.892 --> 26:32.765
of three
Sahaba of Greater Sahel HVTs.

26:32.808 --> 26:34.854
High-level leadership
that had a hand

26:34.897 --> 26:37.247
in plotting yesterday's attacks.

26:38.031 --> 26:40.947
Saidou and Ousmane Boukare
are brothers.

26:40.990 --> 26:42.905
We've confirmed
their two cars are parked

26:42.949 --> 26:45.168
at a safe house in
the market district of Kaya.

26:45.212 --> 26:47.127
Third HVT, Idrissa Kango,

26:47.170 --> 26:49.520
is in a separate safe house
one block north.

26:49.564 --> 26:51.522
Lieutenant Davis will share
the rest of the package

26:51.566 --> 26:53.046
that I've supplied her.

26:53.089 --> 26:55.091
I expect you to be departing
no later than 2300 hours.

26:55.135 --> 26:57.659
- Clock's ticking.

26:57.703 --> 26:59.095
Clock is ticking. I mean...

26:59.139 --> 27:00.401
So much for foreplay.

27:00.444 --> 27:02.533
Targets are close to each other.

27:02.577 --> 27:04.144
We can, uh, foot patrol in.

27:04.187 --> 27:05.754
Let's start with the two-for-one
brothers and move on from there.

27:05.798 --> 27:07.060
Okay, this "market district"

27:07.103 --> 27:08.583
isn't as wholesome
as it sounds.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.064
In good times, it's a center
for criminal activity.

27:11.107 --> 27:12.718
So you mix in
the SGS presence,

27:12.761 --> 27:15.285
plus all the civilians packed
tight in the neighborhood...

27:15.329 --> 27:17.592
We stir up any hornets
in that first target,

27:17.636 --> 27:20.421
that, uh, one-block trek
could turn Mogadishu Mile.

27:20.464 --> 27:22.771
Jase, we can un-ass
the trucks here,

27:22.815 --> 27:24.730
stick to the shadows,
short patrol in,

27:24.773 --> 27:25.948
and then run the alley...

27:25.992 --> 27:27.297
All the way
to the second house.

27:27.341 --> 27:29.473
Full combat clearance.
Blacked out. I like it.

27:29.517 --> 27:31.475
- Fast, quiet, smooth.
That's right.

27:31.519 --> 27:32.694
What about a sniper
covering down

27:32.738 --> 27:34.087
for the patrol
between targets?

27:34.130 --> 27:35.392
No, the plan is solid.
No need to complicate it.

27:35.436 --> 27:37.090
Whoa, whoa.
What are you thinking?

27:37.133 --> 27:39.266
Right, once we take that
first house, clear the roof,

27:39.309 --> 27:40.963
I post there,
have your backs for the move.

27:41.007 --> 27:43.313
Sniper overwatch as we hit
the second target.

27:43.357 --> 27:44.880
Yeah, I like it.

27:46.229 --> 27:48.623
You get it, but Ray doesn't.
Look at his face.

27:48.667 --> 27:51.147
Yoko Blonde-oh getting in the
middle of John and Paul again.

27:53.236 --> 27:56.370
No, no. No,
it shouldn't be a problem.

27:56.413 --> 27:59.068
- Let's nail this thing down.
Mm-hmm.

28:03.203 --> 28:05.379
Havoc, this is 1.
Anything on ISR?

28:05.422 --> 28:06.554
<i>Negative, Bravo 1.</i>

28:06.597 --> 28:08.469
MSR is clear. Over.

28:08.512 --> 28:09.644
<i>Copy that.
Appreciate you, ma'am.</i>

28:09.688 --> 28:10.993
<i>We're moving. Out.</i>

28:19.567 --> 28:21.569
That's the safe house.

28:23.527 --> 28:24.659
- Lights are out...
- Yeah.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.574
...but somebody's home.

28:26.617 --> 28:27.880
Check those cars.

28:32.798 --> 28:34.321
It's the right cars. We're good.

28:34.364 --> 28:36.236
You're up, Clay. Take us out.

28:41.632 --> 28:43.722
Lieutenant Davis,
need to speak to you.

28:43.765 --> 28:46.159
- Sir, we're just
in the middle...
- Now.

29:23.979 --> 29:27.766
<i>All stations, be advised,
I pass Albatross.</i>

29:29.028 --> 29:30.594
What?

29:31.378 --> 29:33.772
I say again. Albatross.

29:38.907 --> 29:41.431
Albatross is RTB.
Damn.

29:42.650 --> 29:43.694
We're canked.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.451
Canking it now?
Two seconds from breaching.

30:01.495 --> 30:04.106
Our meters are pegged.

30:04.150 --> 30:06.152
Suppose we didn't
hear that call.

30:06.195 --> 30:08.328
We heard it. Stand down.

30:08.371 --> 30:10.504
Come on.

30:18.033 --> 30:19.556
- This is crap, man.
- Whoa, take it easy, all right?

30:19.600 --> 30:22.298
There's got to be a reason
why they canked the op, Sonny.

30:22.342 --> 30:24.866
Davis, what the hell, man?
You can't cank-bird an op

30:24.910 --> 30:26.085
- when we're right on the edge,
you understand?
Whoa, whoa, easy.

30:26.128 --> 30:27.695
- Okay, listen...
- Step back, Sonny.

30:27.738 --> 30:29.218
- I got him. Come on.
- Dryden told me
to pass the order.

30:29.262 --> 30:29.871
- He left me
in the dark as to why.
- I'll handle him.

30:29.915 --> 30:31.525
I'll handle him.

30:31.568 --> 30:34.310
I am trying real hard
not to feel like

30:34.354 --> 30:36.051
the Agency
just jerked us around.

30:36.095 --> 30:37.879
Could've been Dryden's way to
let us know we're on his leash.

30:37.923 --> 30:39.272
The intel was real.

30:39.315 --> 30:40.926
There's no way that Dryden's
gonna pass up a shot

30:40.969 --> 30:42.971
at a HVT
without a solid reason.

30:43.015 --> 30:45.495
I'm just saying it's dangerous
to cank it that late.

30:46.932 --> 30:49.325
Least he can do is look us
in the eyes and explain himself.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.639
Why you going after Davis
like that, huh?

30:58.682 --> 31:00.032
We're on enemies' doorstep

31:00.075 --> 31:01.816
and Havoc yanks it
right from underneath us.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.296
Stop.
Just stop right there, okay?

31:03.339 --> 31:04.863
You know that wasn't
Davis's call.

31:04.906 --> 31:06.473
I mean, back there,
it sounded like the old Sonny.

31:06.516 --> 31:07.866
I thought we were leaving that
in the past.

31:07.909 --> 31:09.476
Look, I don't give a damn
whose call it was, okay?

31:09.519 --> 31:11.130
If I wanted to be stood down
and hands-off,

31:11.173 --> 31:12.609
I would've just stayed at home.

31:12.653 --> 31:14.394
Kinda get my fill of that there.

31:14.437 --> 31:15.961
What's that mean?

31:16.004 --> 31:17.832
Just forget it.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.268
Forget it.

31:19.312 --> 31:21.618
This about your daughter,
Leanne?

31:23.011 --> 31:24.665
- Look...

31:24.708 --> 31:27.581
Look, man, all the dads

31:27.624 --> 31:29.713
on the teams go through this.

31:29.757 --> 31:31.193
I know, but it just sucks

31:31.237 --> 31:33.674
that she's growing up
every day without me.

31:33.717 --> 31:35.328
I know.
I've been there, I get it.

31:35.371 --> 31:36.938
I understand. It sucks.

31:36.982 --> 31:39.636
But even if your daughter was
back in Vah Beach,

31:39.680 --> 31:41.377
we'd be gone, what,
300 days out of the year?

31:41.421 --> 31:42.857
You know that, right?

31:42.901 --> 31:45.599
So you have to control
what you can control.

31:45.642 --> 31:49.429
- Keep the emotions under...
- The Overlord called
another meeting.

31:49.472 --> 31:51.039
Just don't backslide on me,
all right?

31:51.083 --> 31:54.564
Just evolve.
Keep evolving. Okay?

31:55.914 --> 31:58.699
Somebody double-book
the Pipehitter Suite?

31:58.742 --> 32:01.267
Thank you all
for being... flexible.

32:01.310 --> 32:03.747
Yeah, feel like I was bent over.

32:03.791 --> 32:06.185
While you were in the field,
we received intel

32:06.228 --> 32:07.621
that at 0700 hours,

32:07.664 --> 32:09.362
all three HVTs will be meeting

32:09.405 --> 32:11.668
at an SGS-controlled airfield
15 klicks south of Kaya

32:11.712 --> 32:13.975
to get on a small plane
out of the country.

32:14.019 --> 32:17.152
Now, because of the nature
and size of the airstrip,

32:17.196 --> 32:18.937
Bravo will partner
with Ground Branch Task Force

32:18.980 --> 32:20.634
to hit the target together.

32:21.591 --> 32:23.245
Look, we had these guys
dead to rights

32:23.289 --> 32:24.681
in their sleep an hour ago.

32:24.725 --> 32:26.466
Now you want us to hit them
on a compound?

32:26.509 --> 32:28.120
Intel dictates strategy.

32:28.163 --> 32:29.991
That's a fortune cookie,
not a tactic.

32:31.558 --> 32:33.777
Lieutenant Davis, can you
pull up the airfield, please?

32:33.821 --> 32:35.954
The airstrip was built out
by an oil multi-national

32:35.997 --> 32:39.174
in the '70s,
right next to their refinery.

32:39.218 --> 32:40.697
Company went under in '79,

32:40.741 --> 32:42.482
but SGS has had control of it
for the last year.

32:42.525 --> 32:45.006
There are at least ten SGS
fighters there at any time.

32:45.050 --> 32:48.401
With more force to be expected
when leadership is on target.

32:48.444 --> 32:51.447
So as many as 20 fighters,
plus three armed HVTs.

32:51.491 --> 32:52.883
Okay, hold on. So you're saying

32:52.927 --> 32:54.407
that you want us to charge
at least two dozen Tangos

32:54.450 --> 32:56.365
in full daylight.
Is that what you're saying?

32:56.409 --> 32:58.150
I believe the sun will be
up at 7:00, yes.

32:58.193 --> 33:00.848
Look at this. These guys
aren't messing around.

33:00.891 --> 33:02.937
I'm seeing at least two PKMs.

33:03.807 --> 33:07.159
Yes, they have maintained
crew-served weapons on site.

33:07.202 --> 33:08.638
So why don't
we just hit 'em en route

33:08.682 --> 33:10.031
instead of playing
on their field?

33:10.075 --> 33:11.728
Yeah.
A vehicle interdiction.

33:11.772 --> 33:13.426
There's only two roads
to the airfield.

33:13.469 --> 33:15.167
We can cover them both, take
the HVTs on their way in,

33:15.210 --> 33:16.907
- safe distance from the target.
- The plan

33:16.951 --> 33:19.432
dictated by the intelligence,

33:19.475 --> 33:22.217
is to take the HVTs
at the airfield.

33:26.830 --> 33:30.008
Bravo will hit the airstrip
and the structure

33:30.051 --> 33:31.922
on the east side of the target,
while the task force

33:31.966 --> 33:33.663
will focus on the west side
of the property,

33:33.707 --> 33:35.752
taking out
the crew-serviced weapons

33:35.796 --> 33:37.754
and clearing
the adjacent building.

33:37.798 --> 33:40.496
Any reason
that can't be executed?

33:44.065 --> 33:47.460
No, sir. We got it handled.

33:57.122 --> 34:00.429
<i>Bravo 1, this is Havoc Base.
Be advised.</i>

34:00.473 --> 34:02.866
<i>Vehicles believed to be
carrying HVTs are on site.</i>

34:02.910 --> 34:04.999
<i>Multiple pax have offloaded
and have moved</i>

34:05.043 --> 34:07.393
<i>into the structure on the east
side of the target compound.</i>

34:07.436 --> 34:09.438
That's good copy. Bravo 1 out.

34:09.482 --> 34:11.310
Still not clear how this op
makes more sense

34:11.353 --> 34:12.833
than the one
that Dryden canked.

34:13.964 --> 34:15.662
Some gears turning here
that we're not seeing.

34:15.705 --> 34:18.882
Yeah. "Works in mysterious ways"
isn't a good quality

34:18.926 --> 34:20.667
for the guy sending us
into the fire.

34:22.495 --> 34:24.714
No use looking back, Ray.

34:26.281 --> 34:28.327
Front-sight focused.

34:28.370 --> 34:30.503
Yep.

34:30.546 --> 34:33.680
<i>I hope Ground Branch
did their job.</i>

34:33.723 --> 34:36.161
<i>Coming into the facility.</i>

34:39.947 --> 34:41.296
Hey, hey!

34:41.340 --> 34:43.516
Left turn, left turn!

34:43.559 --> 34:45.126
Left turn!

34:45.953 --> 34:49.391
We've reached the secondary
breach point. Everyone on me.

34:51.698 --> 34:53.613
Moving to secondary breach.
On me.

34:53.656 --> 34:54.657
Move, move!

35:18.203 --> 35:19.987
Turning steel!

35:37.874 --> 35:40.007
Two just squirted right!

35:54.761 --> 35:56.458
Frag out!

35:58.460 --> 35:59.809
Get it.

36:01.376 --> 36:03.204
You got a match?
Two of the HVTs.

36:03.248 --> 36:05.685
Only one we're missing
is Saidou Boukare.

36:05.728 --> 36:07.426
Rest of the building's clear.

36:07.469 --> 36:09.079
Those few guys are nobody.

36:11.734 --> 36:13.693
That didn't sound like anything
we brought on target.

36:13.736 --> 36:15.260
<i>All stations,
Vehicle 1 is down hard.</i>

36:15.303 --> 36:17.740
<i>I say again,
Vehicle 1 is down hard.</i>

36:17.784 --> 36:19.133
All right, look, the Agency boys

36:19.177 --> 36:20.569
are getting crushed.
We got to get out there.

36:20.613 --> 36:23.050
Machine gun nest
won't make that easy.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.802
- Gotta move, Jace.

36:35.845 --> 36:36.933
Can't help with our partners

36:36.977 --> 36:38.152
until we take down
that heavy gun.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.545
Trent, Sonny.
Get to higher ground,

36:39.588 --> 36:42.156
- get on that, will you?
- Roger that. Moving.

36:44.027 --> 36:46.900
That wash by the loading dock
is all dead space.

36:46.943 --> 36:48.902
- Should get us there.
- We got to move. Let's go.

36:48.945 --> 36:50.991
Clay, on you. Lead us out.

37:12.317 --> 37:14.319
You gonna fit in here?

37:14.362 --> 37:16.451
Your mom fits in here.

37:17.887 --> 37:20.673
We can punch
through here.
Looks good, let's move.

37:26.200 --> 37:27.636
They're dug in.

37:50.833 --> 37:52.748
Talk to me, Ray.

37:52.792 --> 37:55.185
Sounds like
Sonny's pig's barking.

37:55.229 --> 37:56.535
Yeah.

37:56.578 --> 37:58.711
Soon as that machine-gun
nest is down, we assault.

38:03.237 --> 38:06.240
You think you could get
a 40 mike-mike back up there?

38:06.284 --> 38:08.895
All day.

38:08.938 --> 38:10.723
Let's do this.

38:16.816 --> 38:18.078
It's down.

38:18.121 --> 38:20.646
Let's go, break out. Break out.

38:20.689 --> 38:22.169
Bravo 3, cover our movement.

38:22.212 --> 38:23.388
<i>Copy, got you covered.</i>

38:52.852 --> 38:54.375
Bravo 6, this is 1.

38:54.419 --> 38:56.159
We're all clear. No HVT.

38:56.203 --> 38:58.858
<i>Copy, Bravo 1. Same here.
Target's secure.</i>

38:58.901 --> 39:00.512
Grey 1, this is Bravo 1.

39:00.555 --> 39:04.080
Any sign of the third HVT
among the KIA out there?

39:04.124 --> 39:06.561
<i>Negative, Bravo 1. Not here.</i>

39:07.910 --> 39:10.260
We got two of the three HVTs.

39:10.304 --> 39:12.350
Saidou Boukare's
not on target.

39:12.393 --> 39:15.570
We had him at his safe house.
Could've had all three there,

39:15.614 --> 39:17.137
saved a lot of sound and fury.

39:17.180 --> 39:19.182
Tip of the spear goes
where it's pointed, Ray.

39:21.054 --> 39:23.056
<i>Bravo 1, this is 6.
You gotta see what's in here.</i>

39:29.932 --> 39:31.586
Looks like a terrorist
ops center.

39:33.283 --> 39:37.157
SGS personnel, maps... targets?

39:37.200 --> 39:39.377
Start SSE on all of it,
will you?

39:43.816 --> 39:46.906
Havoc, this is Bravo 2,
uploading on-site data to you.

39:46.949 --> 39:48.342
We hit the motherlode here.
Over.

39:48.386 --> 39:49.735
<i>Copy, Bravo 2.</i>

39:49.778 --> 39:51.998
Scan for any sign

39:52.041 --> 39:54.043
of Saidou Boukare's whereabouts.

39:54.087 --> 39:57.090
We know that he made contact
with two HVTs on target.

39:57.133 --> 39:59.092
Cross-reference their phone IPs.

39:59.135 --> 40:00.615
What is it?

40:00.659 --> 40:03.096
Messages from a cell IP
we believe to be Boukare's

40:03.139 --> 40:04.619
indicates that he's going
to be on a train

40:04.663 --> 40:06.708
headed from Kaya
to Ougadougou.

40:06.752 --> 40:08.144
No-show for his flight
out of country.

40:08.188 --> 40:09.581
Why is he traveling
to the capital?

40:09.624 --> 40:11.321
We have something
clear and present.

40:12.366 --> 40:14.368
Chatter on SGS channels suggests

40:14.412 --> 40:16.326
this commuter train
is the group's next target.

40:16.370 --> 40:18.633
Indications of a planned
suicide bombing on board,

40:18.677 --> 40:20.026
- within the hour.
- Okay, that is the same train

40:20.069 --> 40:21.810
that we believe
Boukare is boarding.

40:21.854 --> 40:23.943
Next stop, martyrdom.

40:26.859 --> 40:28.208
It's bigger than that.

40:32.517 --> 40:35.476
Look where the train route
takes it.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.913
That's the target.

40:41.308 --> 40:42.962
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.

40:43.005 --> 40:45.181
What we doing, Jace? Follow-on?

40:45.225 --> 40:47.836
Check. Little birds
on their way to grab us.

40:47.880 --> 40:49.621
All right, our last HVT,
he's on a train,

40:49.664 --> 40:50.926
- on the move.
- Train interdiction?

40:50.970 --> 40:52.711
Straight up Butch Cassidy
and Sundance.

40:52.754 --> 40:55.931
Yeah. Except that train

40:55.975 --> 40:57.542
wasn't rigged with an S-vest,
heading towards

40:57.585 --> 40:59.021
- the U.S. Consulate building.
- We don't catch it in time,

40:59.065 --> 41:00.762
it'll blow the consulate
and half the block around it.

41:02.155 --> 41:04.113
Little birds are here.
Let's move. Come on.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.916
Jace. You coming or what?

41:29.965 --> 41:31.924
Ray, that's Mandy.

41:32.794 --> 41:35.449
In SGS custody?

41:35.493 --> 41:36.842
How?

41:36.885 --> 41:39.061
I don't know,
but we got to do something.

41:41.150 --> 41:43.196
Look, brother,
we'll figure that out.

41:43.239 --> 41:44.806
Right now,
we got a train to catch.
