00:03.103 --> 00:05.571
CIA profile:
Agent Sydney Bristow.

00:05.572 --> 00:06.471
Okay. I'm in.

00:06.473 --> 00:09.408
Agent Bristow works undercover
with her father, Jack Bristow.

00:09.476 --> 00:11.276
Also a double agent with CIA.

00:11.277 --> 00:12.711
Get down!

00:12.712 --> 00:14.847
I guess we'll have to learn
to trust each other.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.348
Bristow's CIA contact:
Michael Vaughn.

00:17.384 --> 00:19.184
My guardian angel.

00:19.185 --> 00:23.781
Her current assignment:
to infiltrate and destroy SD-6.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.519
A secret organization
dealing in espionage,

00:26.593 --> 00:29.756
extortion, weapons sales,
posing as the CIA.

00:29.829 --> 00:32.695
SD-6 has made over $400 million
in arms sales alone.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.700
SD-6 director: Arvin Sloane.

00:34.701 --> 00:37.431
The sanctity of this agency
requires the sacrifice

00:37.504 --> 00:38.937
of some personal freedoms.

00:38.938 --> 00:41.438
This is not about cutting off
an arm of the monster.

00:41.508 --> 00:43.342
This is about killing
the monster.

00:43.343 --> 00:46.574
Bristow's mother,
formerly Russian intelligence,

00:46.646 --> 00:49.240
recently turned herself in
to the CIA.

00:49.315 --> 00:51.016
Mom?

00:51.017 --> 00:52.418
Intel indicates

00:52.419 --> 00:55.252
she may still be
an enemy of the United States.

00:56.456 --> 00:59.289
The true loyalty
of Agent Bristow's mother

00:59.359 --> 01:01.360
remains unknown.

01:01.361 --> 01:02.494
Previously on "Alias"...

01:02.495 --> 01:04.995
I am Mr. Sark,
Director of Operations.

01:04.998 --> 01:06.565
Who is your employer?

01:06.566 --> 01:08.634
My employer's identity
will have to remain

01:08.635 --> 01:11.135
confidential for now.

01:12.338 --> 01:13.739
You tell your employer

01:13.740 --> 01:16.008
if he ever wastes my time
like this again,

01:16.009 --> 01:19.206
our next meeting
will not be so cordial.

01:24.617 --> 01:27.177
Under Proposition 36,
you are to receive probation

01:27.253 --> 01:28.854
and are hereby ordered
to complete

01:28.855 --> 01:30.956
a certified
drug treatment program.

01:30.957 --> 01:34.825
Arvin Sloane is a man
of integrity and courage.

01:34.894 --> 01:35.928
As the head of SD-6,

01:35.929 --> 01:39.228
he brilliantly executed
Alliance policy.

01:39.299 --> 01:42.826
Now, as the newest
full partner of The Alliance,

01:42.902 --> 01:45.598
I feel confident
that he will play a major part

01:45.672 --> 01:48.232
in shaping that policy.

01:48.308 --> 01:51.141
Welcome to The Alliance.

01:53.413 --> 01:55.414
- You've agreed to see her?
- Yes.

01:55.415 --> 01:58.407
- She is the enemy.
- And so is Sloane.

01:58.485 --> 02:00.219
If the devil herself
wants to help me

02:00.220 --> 02:01.854
bring him down, fine by me.

02:01.855 --> 02:03.555
You're smarter than this.

02:03.556 --> 02:06.753
Your mother wants you
to think she's your ally.

02:06.826 --> 02:09.326
The minute you start
depending on her,

02:09.395 --> 02:11.895
she will gut you.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.074

02:27.514 --> 02:29.548
Freelancer
requests covert entry.

02:29.549 --> 02:33.315
That's a copy.
We'll notify Agent Vaughn.

02:36.623 --> 02:37.789
No one's following her.

02:37.790 --> 02:39.258
Ident confirmed.

02:39.259 --> 02:41.759
Freelancer is
approaching Quadrant 4.

02:41.794 --> 02:44.922
Sig Int reporting clear.
No suspect signals.

02:53.339 --> 02:57.332
Agent Bristow,
thank you for coming in.

02:57.410 --> 02:59.011
I know you weren't wild
about talking

02:59.012 --> 03:01.213
with your mother last week,
but I hope we can agree

03:01.214 --> 03:04.183
the information she gave us
made it worth your discomfort.

03:04.250 --> 03:05.751
I thought so.

03:05.752 --> 03:07.786
Until an hour ago.

03:07.787 --> 03:08.754
How is that?

03:08.755 --> 03:11.156
I just came from a meeting
with Sloane.

03:11.157 --> 03:12.925
The camera I took
from Fordson's vault,

03:12.926 --> 03:14.960
the camera we tried
to keep from SD-6,

03:14.961 --> 03:16.595
was an early prototype.

03:16.596 --> 03:18.997
The real camera is
to be launched into orbit

03:18.998 --> 03:20.666
72 hours from now.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.201
By whom?

03:22.202 --> 03:24.102
The Asiatic Space Agency.

03:24.103 --> 03:26.765
Founded after the fall
of the Iron Curtain.

03:26.839 --> 03:30.240
The ASA consists mainly
of displaced Russian scientists.

03:30.310 --> 03:33.837
Their latest client
is an old friend of ours.

03:37.116 --> 03:38.150
Sark.

03:38.151 --> 03:40.452
What's his interest
in launching a satellite?

03:40.453 --> 03:41.553
That's the question.

03:41.554 --> 03:44.054
The satellite is equipped
with an imaging camera.

03:44.090 --> 03:47.025
This camera's capable
of seeing through solid matter

03:47.093 --> 03:48.927
up to a depth of 100 meters.

03:48.928 --> 03:50.529
It is imperative

03:50.530 --> 03:53.397
that we find out
what Mr. Sark is looking for.

03:53.466 --> 03:55.767
The launch site's in Sri Lanka.

03:55.768 --> 03:58.362
Sloane wants us to infiltrate it
posing as corporate buyers.

03:58.438 --> 04:00.339
Our mission is to hack
into the satellite

04:00.340 --> 04:03.207
so SD-6 can tap into Sark's feed
and see what he sees.

04:03.276 --> 04:04.910
I'll get Technical Services
on that.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.044
We'll hack into that feed, too.

04:06.045 --> 04:07.980
That's a fine preliminary step,

04:07.981 --> 04:09.548
but I will want to know
what we're looking for

04:09.549 --> 04:13.451
before the satellite
is launched.

04:15.955 --> 04:17.522
You want me
to talk to her again.

04:17.523 --> 04:20.253
Mr. Sark has assumed control
of your mother's operation.

04:20.326 --> 04:21.459
Stop referring
to her as my mother.

04:21.461 --> 04:23.895
Ms. Derevko must
know what he's looking for,

04:23.896 --> 04:25.130
and she will
only speak with you.

04:25.131 --> 04:27.065
I talked to her before
because I had to.

04:27.066 --> 04:29.301
I have no intention
of making this a habit.

04:29.302 --> 04:32.237
I assume you have an opinion
on this, Agent Vaughn.

04:33.406 --> 04:35.507
I don't have
an easy answer to that.

04:35.508 --> 04:38.008
I'll take a complicated one.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.648
I can't pretend
to hide my bias here.

04:42.649 --> 04:44.383
Irina Derevko
betrayed this country

04:44.384 --> 04:47.717
and killed my father
in the process.

04:47.787 --> 04:50.551
On the other hand, she is
a certifiable Rambaldi expert

04:50.623 --> 04:52.491
and knows more
about the inner workings

04:52.492 --> 04:53.959
of global organized crime

04:53.960 --> 04:57.418
than any other person
in U.S. custody.

04:58.531 --> 05:01.056
Having said that,

05:01.134 --> 05:03.830
Agent Bristow and I were
effectively countering SD-6

05:03.903 --> 05:06.071
before Derevko
turned herself in,

05:06.072 --> 05:10.338
and I stand behind
whatever she decides.

05:13.846 --> 05:16.014
I do understand that you're
caught in the middle

05:16.015 --> 05:18.083
of all this, Agent Bristow.

05:18.084 --> 05:19.217
I can only offer my word.

05:19.218 --> 05:20.452
The sooner we know
what she knows,

05:20.453 --> 05:24.116
the sooner you'll never
have to speak with her again.

05:24.190 --> 05:27.353
We weren't scheduled
to meet until Wednesday.

05:27.427 --> 05:30.123
Is everything all right?

05:30.196 --> 05:32.130
I'm here to talk about Sydney.

05:32.131 --> 05:35.100
Good.
What's on your mind?

05:36.436 --> 05:41.635
I want your help in devising
a strategy to persuade Sydney

05:41.708 --> 05:43.975
not to interact with her mother.

05:43.976 --> 05:44.643
Why?

05:44.644 --> 05:48.637
Because Irina Derevko
is an opportunistic sociopath

05:48.715 --> 05:51.083
who'll use whatever inroads
she can make with my daughter

05:51.084 --> 05:53.644
to get what she wants.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.687
Have you considered that
the more you keep her

05:55.688 --> 05:56.555
from her mother,

05:56.556 --> 05:59.218
the more you're going
to spark her interest?

05:59.292 --> 06:01.259
Of course I have.

06:01.260 --> 06:03.695
Which is why I'm hoping
to devise a strategy

06:03.696 --> 06:06.196
with the necessary subtlety.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.267
Well, I'm sorry,

06:09.268 --> 06:11.069
but I am not in the habit

06:11.070 --> 06:13.732
of helping a father
manipulate his daughter.

06:13.806 --> 06:16.900
No matter how good
his intentions may be.

06:16.976 --> 06:19.476
I see.

06:20.179 --> 06:23.273
Is your opinion here
based on what's best for Sydney

06:23.349 --> 06:24.816
or for the Agency?

06:24.817 --> 06:27.684
The fact is if Sydney
doesn't talk to Laura,

06:27.754 --> 06:29.121
the CIA learns nothing.

06:29.122 --> 06:33.422
So you still think of her
as Laura,

06:33.493 --> 06:36.485
even though that was her alias.

06:57.850 --> 07:01.081
Autocircadian meditation.

07:01.154 --> 07:05.022
All the benefits of sleep
in a fraction of the time.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.528
I can teach it to you.

07:09.529 --> 07:11.296
I told you, when we speak,

07:11.297 --> 07:14.289
you are to address me
as Agent Bristow.

07:17.069 --> 07:19.137
Mr. Sark was
one of your top operatives.

07:19.138 --> 07:21.573
He's now assumed control
of your assets.

07:21.574 --> 07:22.741
He's launching a satellite

07:22.742 --> 07:25.076
with ground-penetrating
surveillance capabilities,

07:25.077 --> 07:26.711
but I doubt this is news to you.

07:26.712 --> 07:29.212
What's he looking for?

07:36.122 --> 07:38.557
Do you remember
when you were 6 years old?

07:38.558 --> 07:41.823
I sent you to piano lessons?

07:43.196 --> 07:45.696
Your teacher was Ms. Adams.

07:46.532 --> 07:47.833
We're not having
this conversation.

07:47.834 --> 07:51.497
You asked me a question.
I'm giving you an answer.

07:51.571 --> 07:52.838
Do you remember
the first thing

07:52.839 --> 07:55.339
Ms. Adams taught you
about music?

08:01.781 --> 08:05.615
She said music is like math.

08:05.685 --> 08:08.848
If you can count, you can play.

08:08.921 --> 08:12.220
Every musical note
has a corresponding frequency.

08:12.291 --> 08:15.658
Middle C, for example,
vibrates at 261 hertz,

08:15.728 --> 08:17.162
which means any piece of music

08:17.163 --> 08:19.431
can be expressed
as a series of numbers.

08:19.432 --> 08:22.663
Sark is looking for a music box
designed by Rambaldi.

08:22.735 --> 08:24.669
The box plays a unique tune.

08:24.670 --> 08:27.468
Encoded within the tune,
there's an equation.

08:27.540 --> 08:29.040
For what?

08:29.041 --> 08:30.709
Zero-Point Energy.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.043
A fuel source.

08:32.044 --> 08:35.673
The military applications
alone would be unlimited.

08:37.149 --> 08:38.750
From a music box?

08:38.751 --> 08:42.278
The music won't play
without the proper combination.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.155
Sark was working
on deciphering it,

08:44.155 --> 08:47.683
but I don't know
whether he was successful.

08:50.796 --> 08:52.430
Fine.

08:52.431 --> 08:53.732
Thank you.

08:53.733 --> 08:56.327
Speaking of Ms. Adams...

08:57.937 --> 09:02.499
Just before I left, I remember
her encouraging you to try out

09:02.575 --> 09:05.635
for your school's
Thanksgiving play.

09:07.446 --> 09:10.176
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to,

09:10.249 --> 09:11.983
but in the 20 years
since I last saw you,

09:11.984 --> 09:14.484
I've often wondered...

09:17.957 --> 09:20.457
What part did you play?

09:24.931 --> 09:27.456
I don't remember.

09:28.234 --> 09:31.567
It was around the time
I was told my mother had died.

09:31.637 --> 09:34.333
Everything else is a blur.

10:15.214 --> 10:17.739
I read Vaughn's debrief.
I know you saw your mother.

10:17.817 --> 10:20.377
You okay?

10:20.453 --> 10:23.320
Seeing her again...

10:23.389 --> 10:27.621
I'm realizing there are
these gaps in my memory

10:27.693 --> 10:31.026
from around the time she left.

10:31.097 --> 10:34.089
Dad, do you remember
the Thanksgiving play

10:34.166 --> 10:36.067
I was in that year in school?

10:36.068 --> 10:37.168
Because I sort of do.

10:37.169 --> 10:40.661
I have an impression of it,
but I can't remember.

10:40.740 --> 10:45.177
Was I a Pilgrim or an Indian?

10:47.213 --> 10:49.909
What?

10:49.982 --> 10:52.482
You were neither.

10:53.719 --> 10:55.620
You were a turkey.

10:55.621 --> 10:56.988
You were the only turkey

10:56.989 --> 11:00.686
that was spared
to celebrate the harvest.

11:07.299 --> 11:10.928
I know you think it's dangerous
for me to see Mom,

11:11.003 --> 11:12.537
but she's a means to an end.

11:12.538 --> 11:14.472
I don't take anything
she says at face value.

11:14.473 --> 11:16.998
She won't expect you to.

11:17.076 --> 11:19.576
Sydney...

11:24.917 --> 11:28.409
I trust your judgment.

11:29.855 --> 11:32.380
You're doing fine.

11:35.127 --> 11:37.627
Okay, once you get
through the launch site

11:37.630 --> 11:41.726
to the exhaust ducts,
press this button right here

11:41.801 --> 11:42.834
and...

11:42.835 --> 11:45.335
Voila.

11:45.938 --> 11:46.671
It's empty.

11:46.672 --> 11:49.368
Totally forgot to tell you.
The real deal, not done yet.

11:49.442 --> 11:52.468
But tomorrow, when you
open up this briefcase,

11:52.545 --> 11:56.675
you will be looking at a
high-performance hydraulic luge.

11:56.749 --> 11:58.149
How fast can I go?

11:58.150 --> 11:59.651
About 150,

11:59.652 --> 12:01.586
which should get you
through the launch facility's

12:01.587 --> 12:04.522
2- mile ducts
in about, uh, 12 seconds.

12:04.590 --> 12:06.357
You want to make sure
you get out of there

12:06.358 --> 12:07.525
fast after you're done

12:07.526 --> 12:09.894
wiring the circuit board
into the satellite

12:09.895 --> 12:12.455
because if you're in the ducts
when the rocket launches,

12:12.531 --> 12:16.297
then, well, boom.

12:17.002 --> 12:19.502
Then I'd miss you.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.846
You wanted to see me?

12:27.847 --> 12:30.347
Come in.

12:32.118 --> 12:35.212
I have something to give you.

12:35.287 --> 12:38.085
It's Emily's seed box.

12:38.157 --> 12:41.456
The lithography's original,
circa 1910.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.495
Her mother gave it to her.

12:43.496 --> 12:46.897
Emily would have
wanted you to have it.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.994
Thank you.

12:51.070 --> 12:54.665
I can't think of Emily
without thinking of her garden.

12:54.740 --> 12:57.265
Well, neither can I.

13:02.882 --> 13:04.783
I miss her, too.

13:04.784 --> 13:08.117
This office is where I feel
most at home these days.

13:08.187 --> 13:10.455
At the house, I don't know.

13:10.456 --> 13:13.584
I seem to be paralyzed.

13:13.659 --> 13:15.326
If a stranger
were to come to the house

13:15.327 --> 13:17.989
for the first time,

13:18.063 --> 13:21.362
they would think
that Emily still lived there.

13:21.433 --> 13:25.733
Her clothes are in the closet,
her makeup on the vanity.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.638
The only thing that betrays
this pretense of normalcy

13:28.707 --> 13:29.908
is her garden.

13:29.909 --> 13:33.072
Where roses once grew,
they're gone now.

13:33.145 --> 13:37.172
Her garden seems
to have died with her.

13:39.952 --> 13:42.452
It's not your fault.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.001
Good luck in Sri Lanka.

14:02.074 --> 14:03.975
Attach this circuit board
to the satellite

14:03.976 --> 14:05.977
instead of the one
you got from SD-6.

14:05.978 --> 14:06.811
It's an exact duplicate.

14:06.812 --> 14:09.679
They'll still be able
to intercept Sark's feed,

14:09.748 --> 14:12.649
but we've modified it so we can
access the signal, too,

14:12.718 --> 14:14.786
see what everyone else
is seeing.

14:14.787 --> 14:15.520
One more thing...

14:15.521 --> 14:17.121
we'd like to bring
Will Tippin in

14:17.122 --> 14:20.558
for a follow-up on his debrief.

14:20.626 --> 14:21.960
Why?

14:21.961 --> 14:23.895
Derevko told us
that Sark has been working

14:23.896 --> 14:26.558
on cracking a combination that
would activate the music box.

14:26.632 --> 14:27.398
Yeah.

14:27.399 --> 14:28.967
We've been reviewing
Tippin's statement,

14:28.968 --> 14:31.402
and he reported falling
in and out of consciousness

14:31.403 --> 14:33.271
on the flight to Taipei
and vaguely remembers

14:33.272 --> 14:34.973
seeing Sark working at a laptop.

14:34.974 --> 14:36.941
You're thinking
induced regression?

14:36.942 --> 14:38.643
We have someone coming in
from Langley.

14:38.644 --> 14:40.311
So he can relive
everything he went through.

14:40.312 --> 14:43.873
If there were another option,
believe me, I'd take it.

14:43.949 --> 14:46.449
Will, the CIA wants
to meet with you again.

14:46.452 --> 14:47.652
Why?

14:47.653 --> 14:50.918
They can tell you
better than I can, but...

14:52.658 --> 14:54.459
Here's your S.O.P.

14:54.460 --> 14:55.960
S.O.P.?

14:55.961 --> 14:58.296
Standard Operating Procedure
for a meet.

14:58.297 --> 15:00.797
You're meeting with my handler.

15:00.799 --> 15:01.566
Vaughn.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.701
He's...

15:03.702 --> 15:07.069
smart, professional,
won't waste your time.

15:08.707 --> 15:09.908
Look, I'm sorry.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.935
You deserve
to move on from this.

15:14.213 --> 15:15.680
Hey, guys.

15:15.681 --> 15:18.181
Hey.

15:19.551 --> 15:21.452
- What are you doing?
- What?

15:21.453 --> 15:22.887
Will just went
to his first N.A. meeting,

15:22.888 --> 15:23.988
and you're waving
a beer in his face?

15:23.989 --> 15:25.323
You're right.

15:25.324 --> 15:26.491
It's okay.

15:26.492 --> 15:29.256
Oh, can you come down
to the restaurant tomorrow?

15:29.328 --> 15:30.762
- Sure.
- All the flatware came in,

15:30.763 --> 15:31.996
and the dishwasher's
not hooked up,

15:31.997 --> 15:33.932
so we have to wash everything
by hand before the opening.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.900
- You're coming, right?
- Are you kidding?

15:35.901 --> 15:36.834
What time?

15:36.835 --> 15:38.036
2:00, 2:30?

15:38.037 --> 15:39.771
I got to go.
I'm going to miss my flight.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.339
Fancy client or boring seminar?

15:41.340 --> 15:43.508
Boring client,
and he's in Sri Lanka,

15:43.509 --> 15:46.273
so I get to fly
15 hours both directions

15:46.345 --> 15:47.278
for a one-hour meeting.

15:47.279 --> 15:48.613
Thanks for letting me stay here

15:48.614 --> 15:51.412
till I can afford
a cheaper place.

16:51.477 --> 16:52.577
Okay, Syd.

16:52.578 --> 16:55.877
Sark's confirmed inside.
You're a go.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.715
The sooner
you get on the phone line,

16:57.716 --> 17:00.412
the more time I have
to hack into their system.

17:01.487 --> 17:03.454
Joanna Kelly from Euro Teledyne.

17:03.455 --> 17:05.980
I have an appointment
with Mr. Vashko.

17:06.058 --> 17:09.255
Mr. Sark, welcome
to our control center.

17:09.328 --> 17:11.922
Will you be the only observer
from your company today?

17:11.997 --> 17:13.031
I'm afraid my associates

17:13.031 --> 17:15.133
have a plan to lobby OPEC
for drilling rights.

17:15.134 --> 17:18.069
We are about to begin
the final system checks.

17:18.137 --> 17:20.637
Excellent.

17:26.278 --> 17:28.246
Miss Kelly.

17:28.247 --> 17:30.747
Welcome to
ASA's launch facility.

17:30.749 --> 17:33.513
Thank you.
I look forward to the tour.

17:33.585 --> 17:35.720
Would you mind if I made a call?

17:35.721 --> 17:36.487
I'm sorry.

17:36.488 --> 17:38.988
We do not allow mobile phone use
during the launch.

17:38.991 --> 17:41.092
It interferes
with the radio signals.

17:41.093 --> 17:44.358
But you are more than welcome
to use one of our landlines.

17:44.430 --> 17:46.930
Thank you.

17:53.772 --> 17:56.140
Hi, darling, just checking in.

17:56.141 --> 17:58.443
Okay, I'm into their
local area network.

17:58.444 --> 17:59.744
It'll take me a minute
to access

17:59.745 --> 18:02.245
the security surveillance feed.

18:02.314 --> 18:04.482
Okay, I'm in.

18:04.483 --> 18:07.577
Miss you, too. Kisses.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.187
And in compliance

18:09.188 --> 18:12.316
with Kyoto environmental
accords, during launch,

18:12.391 --> 18:15.622
we filter the rocket's exhaust
through 2-mile ducts.

18:15.694 --> 18:18.288
I understand these ducts
are capable of channeling

18:18.363 --> 18:20.731
over a million pounds of thrust.

18:20.732 --> 18:23.232
You have done your homework.

18:23.235 --> 18:28.070
I will take you
to the VIP observation deck.

18:28.140 --> 18:31.200
The view is spectacular.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.307
My watch stopped.
Do you have the time?

18:39.384 --> 18:41.884
Oh, sure.

18:44.323 --> 18:46.823
Okay, Dixon, I'll be
in the canal in two minutes.

18:46.825 --> 18:47.925
Copy that, Syd.

18:47.926 --> 18:50.328
Ready to cut the surveillance
feed on your signal.

18:50.329 --> 18:52.630
Radio frequency system.
Check.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.699
Activation vehicle telemetry.
Check.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.134
Onboard power test.
Check.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.068
Data transponder

18:57.069 --> 18:59.663
and launch vehicle
remote control. Check.

20:00.799 --> 20:02.466
Dixon, I'm in position.

20:02.467 --> 20:03.768
Copy that, Syd.

20:03.769 --> 20:05.770
The ground crew's
left the launch deck.

20:05.771 --> 20:08.569
I'm shutting down surveillance
for five minutes starting...

20:08.640 --> 20:11.140
now.

20:12.311 --> 20:15.246
We lost the TV feed
to the launch deck.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.459
What's the problem?

20:28.460 --> 20:30.960
I will know shortly.

20:49.481 --> 20:50.815
Dixon, how am I doing?

20:50.816 --> 20:52.550
3 minutes, 10 seconds

20:52.551 --> 20:55.884
until surveillance
is restored, Syd.

20:55.954 --> 20:57.021
Power surge.

20:57.022 --> 20:59.090
We will be back on-line
in three minutes.

20:59.091 --> 20:59.824
We assure you,

20:59.825 --> 21:02.885
this in no way indicates
a problem with the launch.

21:02.961 --> 21:04.195
Is there any way
into the launch zone

21:04.196 --> 21:05.529
that isn't visible from here?

21:05.530 --> 21:08.055
Just the exhaust ducts,
but our ground crews

21:08.133 --> 21:10.966
don't go anywhere near them
during countdown.

21:12.871 --> 21:14.972
Move up the launch.

21:14.973 --> 21:15.906
Pardon?

21:15.907 --> 21:18.309
I'm splicing into
the internal supply system now.

21:18.310 --> 21:19.777
Almost there.

21:19.778 --> 21:22.113
You said the cameras
don't affect the launch.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.481
They don't, but if something

21:23.482 --> 21:24.682
were to go wrong,
we want to study...

21:24.683 --> 21:26.851
Then begin the final countdown.

21:26.852 --> 21:28.486
Or should we abort altogether?

21:28.487 --> 21:29.954
I can spread the word
amongst my colleagues

21:29.955 --> 21:31.355
that the Asiatic Space Agency

21:31.356 --> 21:34.484
is nothing but the poor man's
version of NASA.

21:38.697 --> 21:41.393
Initiate the final countdown.

21:41.466 --> 21:44.629
We're advancing our timetable.

21:46.471 --> 21:49.599
Sydney, get out of there.
They've moved up the launch.

21:58.483 --> 22:01.452
I'm still wiring the board.
How much time do I have?

22:01.520 --> 22:03.854
48 seconds and counting.

22:03.855 --> 22:06.157
Switching to internal power.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.925
Transmitter shows
engine to launch.

22:07.926 --> 22:09.894
Sydney,
it's too dangerous. Abort.

22:09.895 --> 22:12.395
We're at 44 seconds
and counting.

22:12.431 --> 22:14.265
Syd, get out of there.

22:14.266 --> 22:16.766
No. I got it.

22:17.903 --> 22:19.804
All systems green
for launch in 30...

22:19.805 --> 22:20.771
29...

22:20.772 --> 22:22.206
28...

22:22.207 --> 22:24.707
27...

22:36.722 --> 22:37.722
3...

22:37.723 --> 22:40.223
2...

22:52.204 --> 22:54.704
Sydney!

23:00.479 --> 23:02.979
I'm all right.

23:03.982 --> 23:07.383
I'll meet you at the rendezvous
in 10 minutes.

23:18.964 --> 23:21.660
- Did you enjoy the launch?
- It was a thrill.

23:57.469 --> 23:58.669
I'm Michael Vaughn.

23:58.670 --> 23:59.670
Hey.

23:59.671 --> 24:01.439
Sorry about
the cloak-and-dagger routine,

24:01.440 --> 24:03.541
but SD-6 may monitor you
from time to time.

24:03.542 --> 24:04.942
We had to make sure
you weren't followed.

24:04.943 --> 24:07.443
Sure, I get it.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.146
So you're Vaughn.

24:09.147 --> 24:10.514
You sound surprised.

24:10.515 --> 24:13.177
No, I just thought
you'd be, uh...

24:13.251 --> 24:14.518
Older.

24:14.519 --> 24:16.487
Ah.

24:16.488 --> 24:19.389
We want to bring you in
for a hypnotherapy session.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.759
From your statement,
we think you might recall

24:21.760 --> 24:25.753
details from your captivity
that could help us.

24:25.831 --> 24:26.497
When?

24:26.498 --> 24:28.032
There's a car waiting for us.

24:28.033 --> 24:30.100
Now?

24:30.101 --> 24:30.801
I can't.

24:30.802 --> 24:33.003
I'm helping my friend
get a restaurant ready.

24:33.004 --> 24:35.598
Francie.

24:35.674 --> 24:37.975
Right.

24:37.976 --> 24:40.911
So tomorrow then?

24:40.979 --> 24:41.979
Sure, okay.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.647
You'll get a call
on your cell phone

24:43.648 --> 24:45.683
from a telemarketer asking
if you're interested

24:45.684 --> 24:47.017
in consolidating your debt.

24:47.018 --> 24:49.353
That will be your signal
to meet here.

24:49.354 --> 24:52.084
We'll have a car take you
to our office.

24:56.061 --> 24:57.995
So every time Sydney
ran out the door

24:57.996 --> 25:02.433
after she got a wrong number,
she was going to meet you?

25:02.501 --> 25:04.969
It's standard protocol,
in case the line's tapped.

25:04.970 --> 25:07.470
It's a low-risk way
to set up a meet.

25:10.275 --> 25:12.109
Did you ever give her
a picture frame?

25:12.110 --> 25:13.711
It was, like, an antique.

25:13.712 --> 25:15.312
She said it was
from somebody at work,

25:15.313 --> 25:20.546
and it was probably just another
way to contact her, right?

25:20.619 --> 25:23.679
Actually, no,
that was just a gift.

25:31.029 --> 25:32.429
It's nice to meet you.

25:32.430 --> 25:34.930
You too.

25:35.233 --> 25:37.963
Congratulations are in order
to both of you.

25:38.036 --> 25:39.770
Thanks to your efforts
in Sri Lanka,

25:39.771 --> 25:41.372
we were able
to intercept the feed

25:41.373 --> 25:45.275
from a satellite launched
by Mr. Sark yesterday.

25:45.343 --> 25:48.540
He's looking
at a 20-square-mile area

25:48.613 --> 25:50.748
of Siberia. Marshall.

25:50.749 --> 25:52.516
Now, I know this looks like

25:52.517 --> 25:55.714
20 miles of frozen
tundrocity, right?

25:55.787 --> 25:59.553
Look at it through
the Terahertz imaging camera.

26:02.227 --> 26:03.961
The symbol of Rambaldi.

26:03.962 --> 26:06.030
What the satellite's looking at

26:06.031 --> 26:09.694
are sub-glacial caverns
under the ice.

26:09.768 --> 26:11.435
It's a natural formation?

26:11.436 --> 26:14.166
Beats me. Without actual
ice core samples,

26:14.239 --> 26:17.504
I can't say anything except,
you know, wow.

26:17.576 --> 26:21.410
You are now looking at an image
with a 10-centimeter resolution.

26:21.479 --> 26:23.514
As you see, in the center
of the cavern,

26:23.515 --> 26:26.848
there appears to be an object
notably composed of metal.

26:26.918 --> 26:30.615
We must acquire this object
before Mr. Sark does.

26:30.689 --> 26:33.681
So you will be accompanied
by a support team.

26:33.758 --> 26:36.283
They will establish a perimeter
with Agent Dixon

26:36.361 --> 26:39.922
to guard every possible entrance
to the cavern.

26:39.998 --> 26:41.765
Sydney, you're on point.

26:41.766 --> 26:44.168
Flight leaves in four hours.

26:44.169 --> 26:47.070
That's all.
You can go.

26:47.839 --> 26:50.535
Jack, would you stay
a minute, please?

26:58.283 --> 27:00.945
I want to ask you
for a favor, Jack.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.788
I think I may have
underestimated

27:04.789 --> 27:07.917
the effect that Emily's death
would have on me.

27:07.993 --> 27:09.526
You're entitled to your grief.

27:09.527 --> 27:12.257
Not when it undermines
my authority here.

27:12.330 --> 27:15.857
My standing
within The Alliance.

27:17.669 --> 27:19.937
I need you to monitor me, Jack.

27:19.938 --> 27:22.998
I need you to pull me aside

27:23.074 --> 27:27.170
if you think that I'm letting
my cards show.

27:27.245 --> 27:29.745
Of course.

27:33.952 --> 27:36.580
The day before she...

27:41.459 --> 27:43.959
The day before she passed,
Emily reserved us a suite

27:43.995 --> 27:47.328
at our favorite bed
and breakfast in Sonoma.

27:49.734 --> 27:53.226
Even in her last moments,
she was planning our future.

27:57.676 --> 28:01.476
I'm not a spiritual man,

28:01.546 --> 28:06.643
but I feel lately her presence

28:06.718 --> 28:10.119
everywhere around me.

28:10.188 --> 28:15.182
Trauma can bring about feelings
of metaphysical familiarity.

28:15.260 --> 28:17.760
Waking dreams, as it were.

28:17.796 --> 28:21.823
On the other hand, who is to say
she isn't with you?

28:27.072 --> 28:29.572
I'm going to count
backwards from three,

28:29.607 --> 28:33.065
and when I reach one,
I want you to lift your head

28:33.144 --> 28:35.669
and tell me where you are.

28:35.747 --> 28:39.706
3... 2... 1...

28:44.055 --> 28:46.555
Where are you?

28:50.261 --> 28:53.924
I'm in a cargo plane...

28:53.998 --> 28:55.733
on the way to Taipei.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.334
Will, how are you feeling?

28:57.335 --> 29:00.429
I'm afraid
they're going to kill me.

29:02.173 --> 29:05.301
I'm afraid they're going
to get to Sydney.

29:05.376 --> 29:06.643
They can't, Will.

29:06.644 --> 29:09.079
You're revisiting
what's already happened.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.148
This is just a memory.

29:11.149 --> 29:14.016
Now, tell me what you see.

29:17.989 --> 29:20.549
Sark...
working on his laptop.

29:20.625 --> 29:23.560
Can you see the screen?

29:25.630 --> 29:27.765
No.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.067
It's too far away.

29:30.068 --> 29:31.201
In his statement,

29:31.202 --> 29:33.702
he said he was picked up
and carried off the plane,

29:33.772 --> 29:36.605
so maybe he got closer.

29:39.144 --> 29:40.811
Will, listen to me.

29:40.812 --> 29:44.009
I want you to think ahead
to when the plane landed,

29:44.082 --> 29:46.283
when you were getting off
the plane.

29:46.284 --> 29:48.619
Can you do that?

29:48.620 --> 29:49.686
Yes.

29:49.687 --> 29:52.187
What do you see?

29:54.492 --> 29:58.428
Oh, God! Please.
Please, please don't kill me.

29:58.496 --> 30:00.197
Please don't kill me.

30:00.198 --> 30:01.231
Wake him up.

30:01.232 --> 30:02.566
It's all right.

30:02.567 --> 30:04.501
Don't kill me.
Oh, please don't.

30:04.502 --> 30:07.096
Will, tell me what's happening.

30:07.172 --> 30:08.705
They're carrying me
off the plane.

30:08.706 --> 30:11.206
Can you see Sark's computer?

30:11.209 --> 30:13.610
No, no,
I'm passing too fast.

30:13.611 --> 30:16.013
Go back and try again.

30:16.014 --> 30:17.881
When you pass the computer,

30:17.882 --> 30:20.382
I want you to stop.

30:27.492 --> 30:29.660
Names. I see names.

30:29.661 --> 30:32.161
Read them to me.

30:33.531 --> 30:36.031
Dostoyevsky...

30:36.034 --> 30:38.628
Nabokov...

30:38.703 --> 30:41.203
Tolstoy...

30:42.273 --> 30:44.773
Chekov.

30:48.613 --> 30:51.113
That's good, Will.

30:51.182 --> 30:54.777
Now, when you hear the tone,
I want you to open your eyes

30:54.853 --> 30:58.721
and as soon as you do, you will
feel rested and refreshed.

30:59.591 --> 31:03.152
I need to check his vitals.
Just give me a minute.

31:13.204 --> 31:15.038
You okay?

31:15.039 --> 31:17.667
I doubt the code that activates
Rambaldi's music box

31:17.742 --> 31:19.243
is a list of Russian authors.

31:19.244 --> 31:22.338
It must be some kind
of cipher text.

31:22.413 --> 31:24.414
Look, under
normal circumstances,

31:24.415 --> 31:27.384
I would never ask this,

31:27.452 --> 31:29.686
but your mother is the only
person who can translate

31:29.687 --> 31:32.155
those names for us
by the time you leave.

31:32.156 --> 31:33.357
If your mother
will give us the code

31:33.358 --> 31:34.992
to activate the music box.

31:34.993 --> 31:36.994
We want you to activate
the box on site.

31:36.995 --> 31:38.929
You'll get it to play,
and we'll record the music

31:38.930 --> 31:41.131
through your comm link,
then you'll destroy it.

31:41.132 --> 31:43.657
Agent Bristow.

32:02.520 --> 32:06.854
Dostoyevsky, Nabokov,
Tolstoy, Chekov.

32:06.925 --> 32:10.019
We took these code words
from Sark's computer.

32:10.094 --> 32:11.995
I want you to translate
them for me.

32:11.996 --> 32:15.295
Give me a pencil and paper.

32:15.366 --> 32:16.199
No.

32:16.200 --> 32:20.000
I can't decipher it
without pencil and paper.

32:52.870 --> 32:54.237
You haven't yet asked me

32:54.238 --> 32:57.139
how I could shoot
my own daughter.

32:59.444 --> 33:01.944
No, I haven't.

33:10.588 --> 33:13.580
I assume you wouldn't need
this combination so urgently

33:13.658 --> 33:16.183
if you didn't know
where the music box was.

33:20.531 --> 33:23.227
Sark won't hesitate to kill you.

33:25.403 --> 33:29.840
I don't want to lose the chance
to explain myself someday.

33:43.688 --> 33:48.648
About the Thanksgiving play...

33:48.726 --> 33:51.226
I was a turkey.

33:58.302 --> 34:00.802
Thank you.

34:39.643 --> 34:42.579
I'm not reading
any inbound contacts!

34:42.647 --> 34:44.848
It looks good.
We're alone out here!

34:44.849 --> 34:46.583
But keep
your motion trackers on,

34:46.583 --> 34:47.784
and stay sharp!

34:47.784 --> 34:50.053
Novak, you're guarding
the Southeast entrance!

34:50.054 --> 34:54.114
Cooper, you guard the North.
Stay on station!

34:54.192 --> 34:56.717
Watch your step.
If you fall through the ice,

34:56.793 --> 34:59.957
it'll freeze over
in four seconds!

35:00.031 --> 35:02.531
Good to know.

35:31.229 --> 35:33.630
Yeah?

35:33.631 --> 35:35.332
Hello?

35:35.333 --> 35:37.833
Hello.

35:46.878 --> 35:47.911
Yes, sir?

35:47.912 --> 35:50.080
Could you get me
Security Section?

35:50.081 --> 35:52.743
I need a back trace on a call
I just received.

35:52.817 --> 35:55.317
Just a moment.

35:57.722 --> 36:00.885
Sir, the call came from
the Baranca Bed and Breakfast

36:00.958 --> 36:03.791
in Sonoma County, California.

36:10.034 --> 36:12.135
Report contacts!

36:12.136 --> 36:15.162
Position one holding!
Negative on contacts!

36:15.239 --> 36:18.037
Position two holding!
No contact!

36:18.109 --> 36:19.643
I'm all alone out here!

36:19.644 --> 36:22.144
Syd, how do you copy in there?

36:24.448 --> 36:26.948
Got you five by, Dixon.

37:06.791 --> 37:08.592
Dixon,
the ice looks shaky.

37:08.593 --> 37:10.994
I'm going to go radio silent
until I pass through.

37:10.995 --> 37:13.930
Copy that! Standing by!

37:49.267 --> 37:54.068
I've had a picture of your face
in my mind for 20 years.

37:56.607 --> 38:00.634
I remember a loving husband,

38:00.711 --> 38:05.080
generous man, patriot.

38:06.717 --> 38:13.122
I may have been under orders
to fabricate a life with you,

38:13.190 --> 38:16.717
but there were times when
the illusion of our marriage

38:16.794 --> 38:19.922
was as powerful for me

38:19.997 --> 38:22.497
as it was for you.

38:23.401 --> 38:26.427
Especially when Sydney was born.

38:29.006 --> 38:32.635
Looking at you now,

38:32.710 --> 38:37.943
I see that illusion
is finally gone.

38:41.218 --> 38:45.416
I want to make something
very clear to you.

38:45.489 --> 38:47.290
There are people here
who believe

38:47.291 --> 38:50.454
you can repay the debt
you owe this country

38:50.528 --> 38:55.227
through your continued
cooperation.

38:55.299 --> 38:57.961
I am not one of them.

38:58.035 --> 39:03.405
And if Sydney, in any way,
becomes victim to your endgame,

39:03.474 --> 39:05.974
I will kill you.

39:06.043 --> 39:09.444
She spent most of her life
believing you were dead.

39:09.513 --> 39:12.209
She'll get used to it again.

39:12.283 --> 39:16.617
No matter what bond
you try to forge with her.

39:22.126 --> 39:23.760
You haven't told her
what you did to her

39:23.761 --> 39:25.829
after I disappeared...

39:25.830 --> 39:28.330
have you?

39:52.056 --> 39:54.854
Base Ops, this is Freelancer.
Do you copy?

39:54.925 --> 39:57.360
Read you loud and clear,
Freelancer.

39:57.361 --> 39:59.861
I found the music box.

40:01.732 --> 40:03.133
It looks intact.

40:03.134 --> 40:06.103
Stand by. I'm going to enter
the code my mother gave me.

40:09.140 --> 40:10.774
Cooper! Novak!

40:10.775 --> 40:13.801
I've got an inbound contact!
Northwest, 100 meters...

40:13.878 --> 40:15.011
can you confirm?

40:15.012 --> 40:16.579
Got 'em on radar!

40:16.580 --> 40:18.681
Ditto!

40:18.682 --> 40:20.650
But I don't see anyone!

40:20.651 --> 40:23.620
The target has stopped!

40:23.687 --> 40:24.954
Correction.

40:24.955 --> 40:28.118
Reading four!
Four tangos!

40:28.192 --> 40:30.427
Approaching
from all directions!

40:30.428 --> 40:31.861
They're heading
for the entrance!

40:31.862 --> 40:32.929
I still don't see!

40:32.930 --> 40:36.991
Sydney, do you copy?!

40:37.067 --> 40:38.134
Sydney!

40:38.135 --> 40:40.370
3-1-1...

40:40.371 --> 40:42.871
2-5-4.

40:52.516 --> 40:55.016
We've got audio.

40:57.721 --> 41:00.918
Talk to me, Cooper!
Your tango is 10 meters away!

41:00.991 --> 41:02.225
I don't see anything!

41:02.226 --> 41:03.660
It's right on top of you!

41:03.661 --> 41:06.161
I'm all over it!

41:07.865 --> 41:09.365
Cooper! Do you copy?

41:09.366 --> 41:12.301
Talk to me, Cooper!

41:12.369 --> 41:14.237
My contact's at 2 meters!

41:14.238 --> 41:16.738
It's got to be
an equipment malfunction!

41:18.809 --> 41:21.244
Novak!
They're under the ice!

41:21.245 --> 41:23.745
Novak!

41:27.151 --> 41:29.651
Do you copy, Sydney?

41:34.425 --> 41:35.525
That's it.

41:35.526 --> 41:36.759
Confirm you've got
the recording.

41:36.760 --> 41:39.854
I'm ready to destroy
the music box.

41:39.930 --> 41:42.728
Affirmative.
We got the recording.

41:42.800 --> 41:45.300
It's affirmative.
I'm 10-7.

41:57.281 --> 41:58.982
Sydney, do you copy?!

41:58.983 --> 42:00.483
Dixon. What's wrong?

42:00.484 --> 42:03.715
Get out of there!
Sark's here!

42:05.723 --> 42:08.223
Put the case down.

42:11.962 --> 42:14.462
Slide it over.

42:20.838 --> 42:23.568
It was you giving us problems
at the launch.

42:25.876 --> 42:27.443
I'd offer you passage back,

42:27.444 --> 42:31.039
but my submersible
only seats four.

42:31.115 --> 42:33.615
It's the thought that counts.
