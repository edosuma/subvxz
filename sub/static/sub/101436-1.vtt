02:13.659 --> 02:15.427
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:27.707 --> 02:29.776
Hang on a sec, hang on.

02:32.111 --> 02:34.479
- Happy Thanksgiving, Greg!
- Wow.

02:34.513 --> 02:36.281
You scared me.

02:42.554 --> 02:43.689
What are you doing here?

02:50.630 --> 02:53.365
- Hello, again.
- Hello, again.

02:53.398 --> 02:56.769
- I'm back.
- You are back, virtually on time.

02:56.803 --> 02:59.872
Right on time,
and I'm back for more, Greg.

03:00.807 --> 03:01.974
Are you ready for more?

03:06.646 --> 03:08.948
- Greg?
- Yes, Es...

03:08.981 --> 03:11.651
- Es...
- Esmeralda.

03:11.684 --> 03:13.019
Esmeralda.

03:13.052 --> 03:14.754
It's very nice to meet you,
Greg.

03:14.787 --> 03:17.422
It's nice to meet you,
Esmeralda.

03:20.860 --> 03:22.028
Please, come in.

03:23.461 --> 03:24.797
Thank you very much Greg.

03:25.898 --> 03:27.099
My apologies.

03:27.133 --> 03:28.868
Apologies, for what?

03:28.901 --> 03:29.969
For being late.

03:30.002 --> 03:31.938
Uh, are you late?

03:31.971 --> 03:34.006
I am, two minutes late.

03:34.040 --> 03:35.708
Aren't you going to let me in?

03:35.741 --> 03:36.876
You're in.

03:36.909 --> 03:38.644
Couple of minutes
isn't even late.

03:38.678 --> 03:40.813
Couple of minutes is well
within the margin of error.

03:40.847 --> 03:42.547
It's Thursday at eight.

03:42.581 --> 03:44.116
- I'm aware.
- Eight on the dot, oh,

03:44.150 --> 03:46.384
8:02, so margin of error.

03:46.418 --> 03:47.887
Esme... Ana, Ana.

03:59.732 --> 04:02.668
- Hey, sorry, not sorry.
- Shannon!

04:02.702 --> 04:05.638
Mom, I am just
saying that if everything

04:05.671 --> 04:07.807
this weekend is going
to be as tedious

04:07.840 --> 04:09.809
as that ridiculous dinner was,

04:09.842 --> 04:13.012
I'm going to call you
to bail me out every time.

04:13.045 --> 04:14.647
I'm not going to leave
your commencement early.

04:14.680 --> 04:17.582
Every time I turned around,
somebody else

04:17.616 --> 04:19.584
was congratulating me.

04:19.618 --> 04:21.053
Congratulations.

04:21.087 --> 04:22.621
Sounds traumatic.

04:22.655 --> 04:24.090
It was like they were giving us

04:24.123 --> 04:25.758
one last final exam, you know,
it was a test

04:25.791 --> 04:27.994
of endurance, make small talk,

04:28.027 --> 04:30.029
reveal your plans
for the future,

04:30.062 --> 04:33.766
pin yourself down,
as your college experience

04:33.799 --> 04:35.433
flashes before your eyes.

04:35.467 --> 04:37.069
Oh, it sounds rough.

04:37.103 --> 04:40.006
On and on and on.

04:40.039 --> 04:41.674
- Ana?
- Really?

04:41.707 --> 04:44.076
So, how was your week?

04:44.110 --> 04:46.879
Was it on
and on and on for you too?

04:46.913 --> 04:48.781
I was having a nice time.

04:48.814 --> 04:51.449
My graduation,
now that was boring,

04:51.483 --> 04:53.653
and it was hot, God it was hot.

04:53.686 --> 04:54.654
School wrapping up?

04:55.688 --> 04:57.489
Did I say I was in school?

04:57.522 --> 04:59.191
You got a coatrack.

04:59.225 --> 05:00.960
You shouldn't be here.

05:00.993 --> 05:02.628
- I shouldn't?
- No.

05:02.662 --> 05:04.797
Hm, should have cancelled then.

05:04.830 --> 05:07.532
Mom, where are we going?

05:07.565 --> 05:08.868
I made reservations
at that restaurant

05:08.901 --> 05:10.236
that we went to
when I visited you,

05:10.269 --> 05:12.905
your sophomore year,
La Bella Pascolo.

05:12.939 --> 05:14.606
- It's on us, Ana.
- Oh,

05:14.640 --> 05:16.709
thank you so much, Ms. Cavana.

05:16.742 --> 05:18.077
Stacy.

05:22.915 --> 05:25.151
- Had to check in.
- Check in. Oh, of course,

05:25.184 --> 05:27.219
- no apology necessary. Check in with...?
- My driver.

05:27.253 --> 05:28.754
- No, never mind, it's...
- It's okay.

05:28.788 --> 05:30.189
- ...not any of mine...
- It's okay, Greg.

05:30.222 --> 05:31.724
I'm sorry.

05:31.757 --> 05:33.726
I have to let him
know when I'm here,

05:33.759 --> 05:35.527
and when I'm leaving.

05:35.560 --> 05:36.729
No pause for sorry.

05:37.997 --> 05:39.665
Standard operating procedure.

05:39.699 --> 05:41.200
It's still the appointment,
Greg.

05:41.233 --> 05:43.169
That's why I'm here, Greg.
You've got a very

05:43.202 --> 05:44.569
nice coatrack, Greg.

05:44.602 --> 05:45.871
You could have cancelled.

05:45.905 --> 05:47.239
You didn't call
or email my booker

05:47.273 --> 05:49.241
to cancel with at least
24 hours' notice.

05:49.275 --> 05:53.545
I figured you...
you'd be celebrating.

05:53.578 --> 05:54.914
I can start tomorrow.

05:54.947 --> 05:56.148
It can wait.

05:56.182 --> 05:58.250
It'll still all
be over tomorrow.

05:58.284 --> 06:00.152
It's going to be fun, guys.

06:00.186 --> 06:02.021
It's better than rubber chicken
and steamed vegetables

06:02.054 --> 06:04.757
- on campus, right?
- I was having a nice time.

06:09.962 --> 06:11.664
Were you good in school?

06:11.697 --> 06:13.966
- You can't tell?
- I can tell,

06:14.000 --> 06:15.935
I just want to hear you say it.

06:15.968 --> 06:17.136
Hear me say it, why?

06:17.837 --> 06:19.105
Because I'm not sure
you say you're good

06:19.138 --> 06:21.741
at anything often enough.

06:21.774 --> 06:22.808
I say it plenty.

06:24.210 --> 06:25.711
Say it.

06:25.745 --> 06:26.779
Say what?

06:26.812 --> 06:28.681
Say, "I was good in school."

06:31.817 --> 06:33.052
I was good at school.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.621
That's hot.

06:36.655 --> 06:39.125
- Wine?
- Please.

06:39.158 --> 06:40.059
Wait!

06:43.996 --> 06:45.563
- Ta-da!
- Wow.

06:45.597 --> 06:47.565
I brought wine.

06:47.599 --> 06:50.069
Ana, allow this to be
the first of several times,

06:50.102 --> 06:52.338
over the course of this weekend,
that I thank you

06:52.371 --> 06:54.974
for being such a positive
influence on my daughter.

06:55.007 --> 06:56.608
Okay.

06:56.642 --> 06:58.644
I try my best,
but your reach across

06:58.677 --> 07:01.613
the Atlantic is a lot longer
than you think, Ms. Cavana.

07:01.647 --> 07:03.349
Ana, please, Stacy.

07:03.382 --> 07:04.984
Stacy, sorry.

07:05.017 --> 07:07.219
I address my elders with
their appropriate titles.

07:08.888 --> 07:10.689
Well, thank you for joining us.

07:13.692 --> 07:15.628
How do you feel?

07:15.661 --> 07:17.229
- I told you.
- Yes,

07:17.263 --> 07:20.166
- but it bears repeating.
- Okay.

07:20.199 --> 07:22.001
I feel good.

07:22.034 --> 07:23.269
I feel very good.

07:33.279 --> 07:35.281
So, I assume you've already
had Thanksgiving dinner?

07:35.314 --> 07:36.982
Hm.

07:37.016 --> 07:38.784
No, not really.

07:38.818 --> 07:40.853
I'm home by myself during break.

07:40.886 --> 07:41.821
You're all alone, huh?

07:43.055 --> 07:45.324
Have you girls talked
about extending your lease?

07:45.357 --> 07:48.060
No. Not yet.

07:48.094 --> 07:49.662
Oh, Ana,
are you going to the beach

07:49.695 --> 07:50.930
next week with everyone?

07:50.963 --> 07:52.765
No, I'm afraid not.

07:52.798 --> 07:55.167
Ana has to work.

07:55.201 --> 07:58.104
I have to work,
I have to work, I have to work.

07:58.137 --> 08:00.172
I'm not blowing an internship

08:00.206 --> 08:01.907
just to spend
a week at the beach.

08:04.810 --> 08:06.846
She's just not a big fan of fun.

08:06.879 --> 08:11.984
Well, the absolute value
of present no fun is future fun.

08:12.017 --> 08:14.120
Nice, Ana.
You know you should take a page

08:14.153 --> 08:15.754
out of her book, Shannon.

08:15.788 --> 08:18.991
Duly noted, duly noted.

08:19.024 --> 08:22.628
La Bella Pascolo is
the next left, Stacy.

08:27.233 --> 08:28.834
Okay, text your guy.
Let him know

08:28.868 --> 08:30.202
everything's okay, right?

08:30.236 --> 08:31.437
That's SOP?

08:31.470 --> 08:33.139
That's right, it is.

08:39.812 --> 08:40.913
Damn.

08:42.914 --> 08:44.049
Yo!

08:46.852 --> 08:48.020
I need a ride.

08:48.053 --> 08:49.822
Hm, you need a car.

08:50.890 --> 08:52.892
There is no guy, Esme.

08:52.925 --> 08:54.226
Come on, bro.

08:55.294 --> 08:56.262
Where are we going?

08:57.229 --> 08:58.230
She needs help.

09:04.970 --> 09:06.939
Right,
there's nobody downstairs,

09:06.972 --> 09:08.474
you don't have a booker.

09:08.507 --> 09:11.143
You haven't checked in
since August, so spare me.

09:13.279 --> 09:16.048
How do you know
that I didn't call

09:16.081 --> 09:18.851
someone for this very occasion?

09:18.884 --> 09:20.953
Because you're a tough guy, Ana,

09:20.986 --> 09:23.355
Esmeralda,
and you're here all alone.

09:23.389 --> 09:25.724
You've been here
all alone since August,

09:25.758 --> 09:27.426
so theoretically
I could decide to never

09:27.459 --> 09:29.461
let you leave, if I was that
sort of person, which I'm not!

09:29.495 --> 09:30.729
- It's pretty fucking...
- Which I'm not...

09:30.763 --> 09:31.730
...dark, Greg.

09:35.167 --> 09:37.369
Would you like a glass of wine?

09:37.403 --> 09:39.004
Wine?

09:39.038 --> 09:41.807
- You opened the bottle, Greg.
- Yes, I did.

09:43.509 --> 09:46.111
- No, thank you, no.
- Oh.

09:46.145 --> 09:47.446
- It's okay.
- Really?

09:47.479 --> 09:48.480
Really,
don't worry about it.

09:48.514 --> 09:49.949
Esme.

09:49.982 --> 09:51.483
Yes?

09:51.517 --> 09:54.286
Uh, how much wine have
you already had tonight?

09:54.320 --> 09:55.454
None!

09:55.487 --> 09:57.223
None?

09:57.256 --> 09:59.858
How much of anything
have you already had tonight?

09:59.892 --> 10:02.061
None, yet.

10:02.094 --> 10:03.495
Really, I'm sorry.

10:03.529 --> 10:05.197
Forget it.

10:05.231 --> 10:07.032
I don't need anything.

10:07.066 --> 10:08.934
Okay. What does that mean?

10:10.569 --> 10:13.005
It means I'm happy, Greg.

10:13.038 --> 10:14.106
Stop it, Ana!

10:14.139 --> 10:16.075
No, no.

10:16.108 --> 10:18.911
You don't use my name,
you don't get to use my name.

10:18.944 --> 10:20.179
You use my name...

10:20.212 --> 10:22.248
It is ridiculous
for me to use that name,

10:22.281 --> 10:24.049
- when I know your name.
- Wow.

10:24.083 --> 10:25.184
"Wow" doesn't win an argument.

10:25.217 --> 10:26.952
Maybe I should call a cop.

10:26.986 --> 10:29.822
Relax, you've smacked me
twice in the last two minutes,

10:29.855 --> 10:32.057
so I think we both know
how safe you feel.

10:32.091 --> 10:34.460
Unclutch your pearls, tough guy.

10:34.493 --> 10:39.498
I'd call it...
sparse yet urbane.

10:39.531 --> 10:42.534
- Urbane.
- You know what urbane means, Greg?

10:42.568 --> 10:43.869
Yes, I do, Esmeralda.

10:43.902 --> 10:46.538
Urbane means... sophisticated.

10:46.572 --> 10:47.873
Sophisticated?

10:49.041 --> 10:50.376
I'll allow it.

10:50.409 --> 10:51.810
Very good, Greg.

10:53.279 --> 10:56.181
A lot of books, a lot of books,
Greg.

10:56.215 --> 10:57.583
It's not that many.

10:57.616 --> 10:59.018
You read all these books?

10:59.051 --> 11:00.286
Of course not.

11:00.319 --> 11:01.487
But everyone who walks in here

11:01.520 --> 11:03.022
assumes you have, right?

11:04.023 --> 11:09.561
You bring people in here,
your friends... a girl.

11:09.595 --> 11:12.398
You bring her in here,
and she sees all these books,

11:12.431 --> 11:15.367
and she thinks, "Ooh,
this Greg character

11:15.401 --> 11:17.403
sure is urbane, isn't he?"

11:17.436 --> 11:18.937
That might just be you.

11:19.872 --> 11:23.842
And like always,
you're ready.

11:23.876 --> 11:25.411
What percentage
do I say I've read?

11:25.444 --> 11:28.514
- You could leave, you should leave.
- But I'm here.

11:28.547 --> 11:34.953
But I'm not saying,
by standing mute, these girls,

11:36.555 --> 11:40.959
women you bring in here, they
think the percentage is 100%.

11:40.993 --> 11:42.127
Standing mute?

11:42.161 --> 11:43.228
Are you in law school?

11:43.262 --> 11:44.863
No, no.

11:44.897 --> 11:47.032
Grad school will be
the year after next.

11:51.437 --> 11:52.371
Biochemistry.

11:52.404 --> 11:54.473
Biochemistry.

11:55.574 --> 11:57.343
I wasn't even in the ballpark.

11:57.376 --> 12:00.479
You weren't even within
a tank of gas of a ballpark.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.214
I'm embarrassed.

12:02.247 --> 12:03.982
I could have sworn law school.

12:04.016 --> 12:05.317
Why?

12:05.351 --> 12:07.286
Because I say, "I'll allow it."

12:07.319 --> 12:09.988
Trust me,
I spend half my time saying

12:10.022 --> 12:12.624
"I'll allow it,"
or "I won't allow it."

12:12.659 --> 12:14.893
- All right, tough guy.
- Tough guy?

12:16.528 --> 12:18.665
Hm, I am a tough guy.

12:18.698 --> 12:20.633
I'm here for the hour,

12:20.667 --> 12:23.268
and don't fucking tell me
to relax.

12:23.302 --> 12:25.070
Okay, fine.

12:25.104 --> 12:26.505
- Take it.
- What?

12:26.538 --> 12:28.340
Take it,
if that's what you want.

12:28.374 --> 12:29.908
- Take it?
- You're here,

12:29.942 --> 12:31.610
on time, within the margin
of error,

12:31.644 --> 12:33.212
so take it.

12:34.179 --> 12:35.381
To new stages.

12:35.414 --> 12:37.116
- Take it?
- Take it...

12:38.117 --> 12:39.686
and get the fuck out of here.

12:39.719 --> 12:41.453
New stages.

12:44.590 --> 12:45.524
Mm.

12:50.095 --> 12:53.932
So, what shall we do tonight?

12:55.200 --> 13:01.373
So, these girls, they see Willie
Shakespeare, Billy Faulkner.

13:01.407 --> 13:04.644
They see Eddie Conlon,
Lorrie Moore.

13:12.151 --> 13:14.987
Biochemistry, you must be smart.

13:15.020 --> 13:17.489
Nah,
just the one mistake they made.

13:17.523 --> 13:21.293
They see all these and they
think, "Ooh, hundred percent."

13:39.111 --> 13:40.379
It's a box, Ana.

13:40.412 --> 13:41.648
You are aware
that I also attended

13:41.681 --> 13:43.582
- that school?
- Oh, really?

13:43.615 --> 13:46.285
Are you looking to get
an alumni discount grade?

13:46.318 --> 13:47.619
For next week?

13:47.654 --> 13:49.288
- Does that exist?
- No.

13:51.123 --> 13:52.391
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

13:52.424 --> 13:53.693
I didn't know.

13:53.726 --> 13:55.327
- You had no right.
- I had no idea!

13:55.360 --> 13:56.361
Bullshit.

13:57.463 --> 13:59.298
I'm busy next week anyway.

14:02.334 --> 14:03.368
Are you?

14:04.637 --> 14:06.538
- No.
- You knew the whole time!

14:06.572 --> 14:08.440
- I did not, I did...
- Yeah, the whole fucking year!

14:08.474 --> 14:10.108
- I didn't.
- Every time you looked at me, and then

14:10.142 --> 14:12.211
you just show up,
without any warning.

14:12.244 --> 14:15.080
- I didn't have any warning.
- You know how creepy that is?

14:15.113 --> 14:16.615
What lines you crossed?

14:16.649 --> 14:18.617
Rough order of magnitude?

14:18.651 --> 14:20.285
You know what a rough
order of magnitude is?

14:20.319 --> 14:22.387
I know what a rough order
of magnitude is, Esme.

14:22.421 --> 14:23.322
Esme?

14:30.362 --> 14:33.131
- You don't like Esme?
- You don't like Esmeralda?

14:33.165 --> 14:34.600
Too many syllables.

14:34.634 --> 14:36.535
Well, you just need to practice.

14:36.568 --> 14:37.503
It is my name.

14:38.671 --> 14:41.607
Esme is not
the same as Esmeralda.

14:41.641 --> 14:43.342
I'm streamlining it by 50%.

14:43.375 --> 14:46.211
Ha, so you're a math guy, okay.

14:46.245 --> 14:48.748
Math guy, what percentage?

14:51.583 --> 14:53.252
Sixty three percent.

14:53.285 --> 14:54.353
Sixty three percent?

14:54.386 --> 14:57.322
Not 62.5, or, or five eighths?

14:58.290 --> 15:00.292
Oh, I get it,
you're rounding up.

15:00.325 --> 15:02.829
Six three percent, Esme.

15:02.862 --> 15:05.364
Whatever you say, Gre.

15:07.634 --> 15:09.568
I've read some
of them more than once.

15:09.601 --> 15:11.671
- So more than 63%.
- That doesn't work though,

15:11.704 --> 15:13.205
because theoretically
you can read

15:13.238 --> 15:15.073
any book an unlimited
amount of times,

15:15.107 --> 15:18.477
so the number of possible
books to read is infinite so...

15:18.510 --> 15:20.680
so again the percentage
would drop way down.

15:22.548 --> 15:23.549
Way down.

15:28.587 --> 15:34.192
Why don't you drop way down
onto that couch, Greg?

15:37.162 --> 15:38.096
Okay.

16:01.353 --> 16:02.755
Have you been thinking
of getting in touch

16:02.789 --> 16:04.657
with me for a long time?

16:04.691 --> 16:06.191
What do you mean?

16:06.224 --> 16:09.328
Did you have
to build up the nerve?

16:11.163 --> 16:14.566
Did you start to contact me,
then change your mind?

16:16.435 --> 16:17.770
Were you scared?

16:17.804 --> 16:19.438
Scared?

16:19.471 --> 16:20.873
No.

16:23.375 --> 16:24.677
You didn't go back and forth?

16:25.878 --> 16:27.279
You didn't waver?

16:29.481 --> 16:30.750
Maybe a couple times,

16:30.783 --> 16:33.185
before finally going
through with it?

16:36.388 --> 16:37.857
You were scared.

16:37.890 --> 16:39.726
- No.
- So I'm wrong?

16:41.526 --> 16:44.329
- Don't be too hard on yourself.
- Oh.

16:44.363 --> 16:45.430
Don't worry about that.

16:50.402 --> 16:52.537
Why would I have
to build up the nerve?

16:52.571 --> 16:57.609
Because... this is
pretty urbane, Greg.

16:57.644 --> 16:59.277
- It is.
- Well...

17:02.614 --> 17:04.215
if it's not urbane now,

17:05.217 --> 17:06.451
it's certainly going to be.

17:07.753 --> 17:09.722
It's going to be
rather urbane, Greg.

17:37.482 --> 17:38.818
You think about me today?

17:41.954 --> 17:43.588
Since you emailed me last night?

17:43.622 --> 17:45.257
Since you texted me back.

17:45.290 --> 17:46.826
That's right.

17:46.859 --> 17:48.895
Since I texted you back.

17:48.928 --> 17:50.328
Didn't know
if you were for real,

17:50.362 --> 17:52.632
if your pictures were real.

17:52.665 --> 17:57.602
Well... here I am.

17:59.438 --> 18:00.405
Am I for real?

18:02.374 --> 18:03.442
It appears so.

18:05.745 --> 18:09.514
I am real,
and you couldn't think

18:09.548 --> 18:11.818
about anything else all day.

18:12.952 --> 18:15.722
You were out of the building
exactly at five,

18:16.723 --> 18:19.025
so you'd have enough time
to prepare for me.

18:19.058 --> 18:21.794
At six, but yes.

18:21.828 --> 18:24.362
And now that I'm here, do I look

18:24.396 --> 18:25.698
like my pictures, Greg?

18:26.799 --> 18:28.701
You look better
than your pictures, Esmeralda.

18:28.735 --> 18:31.871
You can say my name.

19:04.670 --> 19:06.538
You know, you look worried.

19:06.571 --> 19:07.774
I'm not worried.

19:10.843 --> 19:12.511
You have nothing to worry about.

19:13.478 --> 19:14.714
- Okay.
- Okay?

19:15.782 --> 19:16.749
It is okay.

19:18.350 --> 19:23.288
You've built up the nerve,
and this takes nerve.

19:29.528 --> 19:34.399
And now...
we're going to have some fun.

20:02.895 --> 20:04.931
It's very nice to meet you,
Greg.

20:06.431 --> 20:09.434
It's nice to meet you,
Esmeralda.

20:14.774 --> 20:18.811
And I heard, I mean, I heard it
was really good though.

20:18.845 --> 20:20.112
- Good evening.
- Oh, good evening.

20:20.146 --> 20:21.681
Good evening.

20:21.714 --> 20:23.149
Uh, Cavana.

20:23.182 --> 20:25.885
Cavana, four, eight o'clock?

20:25.918 --> 20:27.519
Yeah, we're a touch early,
I'm sorry.

20:27.552 --> 20:29.856
- Four?
- Has it entire party arrived?

20:29.889 --> 20:32.058
- Uh, yeah.
- Mom?

20:32.091 --> 20:34.961
Um, he's coming up
right behind us.

20:34.994 --> 20:36.863
This was impromptu. Uh.

20:36.896 --> 20:38.831
He's predicting 15 minutes.

20:38.865 --> 20:41.634
We don't normally seat parties
until everyone's arrived.

20:41.667 --> 20:43.836
- Mom, you're kidding.
- Shannon, relax.

20:43.870 --> 20:45.771
Don't tell me to relax.

20:45.805 --> 20:47.439
So, perhaps
you could all wait at the bar,

20:47.472 --> 20:48.473
until he gets here.

20:48.506 --> 20:49.407
Thank you.

20:51.509 --> 20:53.411
Look, I'm sorry.

20:53.445 --> 20:54.847
Tell me, tell me Greg,
what is it?

20:54.881 --> 20:56.148
What is it that
you're sorry for?

20:56.182 --> 20:57.449
I mean if you didn't know,

20:57.482 --> 20:58.851
if you did not know,

20:58.885 --> 21:00.920
then what is it
that you're sorry for?

21:24.677 --> 21:27.512
You couldn't even get
this off me.

21:27.545 --> 21:29.715
You're horrible at this.

21:29.749 --> 21:32.785
So, finals are wrapping up?

21:34.987 --> 21:38.590
Yeah, yeah, they're,
they're still going,

21:38.623 --> 21:40.458
and then it's summer sessions.

21:41.694 --> 21:47.465
So, lectures,
labs, an internship.

21:48.634 --> 21:51.003
Yeah, it's time management,
is all it is.

21:52.038 --> 21:55.942
And look at that,
you got all that for free.

21:55.975 --> 21:58.644
Uh, I'd say
the economic calculus

21:58.678 --> 22:00.846
we're working here
is complicated.

22:02.048 --> 22:03.049
Yes.

22:03.983 --> 22:04.951
Math guy.

22:08.553 --> 22:09.889
Okay.

22:09.922 --> 22:12.124
I am in economics.

22:12.158 --> 22:14.093
- Satisfied?
- Never.

22:15.895 --> 22:16.829
Are you?

22:17.797 --> 22:19.665
With your work?

22:19.699 --> 22:21.834
You analyze the past, you make
predictions in the present,

22:22.902 --> 22:24.770
the future makes you
right or wrong.

22:24.804 --> 22:26.806
Using real money?

22:26.839 --> 22:29.976
I'm an economist,
that's finance.

22:30.009 --> 22:33.913
So, what does it matter
if you're right or wrong?

22:33.946 --> 22:35.047
It does to me.

22:35.081 --> 22:37.549
Yeah, I'm sure you go around

22:37.582 --> 22:40.786
apologizing to everyone.

22:40.820 --> 22:43.789
Your sorrys are for shit.

22:43.823 --> 22:47.226
Your apologies hold no currency.

22:47.259 --> 22:48.728
Hey, cut me some slack,
I'm trying

22:48.761 --> 22:50.129
to get better every week.

22:50.162 --> 22:52.098
Hey,
are you trying to get better?

22:52.131 --> 22:54.300
Or do you actually
want to get better?

22:54.333 --> 22:56.302
I actually want to get better,
coach.

22:56.335 --> 22:59.571
Okay, then, we're going to keep
burning it until we get it right,

22:59.604 --> 23:02.908
but not horrible.

23:02.942 --> 23:04.243
Not horrible.

23:04.276 --> 23:05.745
How do you know
I haven't told her?

23:07.113 --> 23:09.281
How do you know
that I didn't tell her

23:09.315 --> 23:11.784
the moment we walked out
of the restaurant?

23:12.985 --> 23:13.886
Or your wife?

23:18.758 --> 23:21.660
She's not my wife, and besides,

23:21.694 --> 23:23.129
I could tell the two
of you were kind of,

23:23.162 --> 23:24.697
you know, altered.

23:24.730 --> 23:27.633
Oh, don't you fucking
dare judge me.

23:27.666 --> 23:29.001
I'm not judging you.

23:32.138 --> 23:34.673
I could have told her
whenever I wanted.

23:36.608 --> 23:40.578
After the ceremony on Sunday,
that night,

23:41.313 --> 23:44.683
whenever I wanted,
and I still could.

23:47.119 --> 23:50.289
Or... maybe I already have.

23:50.322 --> 23:51.824
You wouldn't be here.

23:51.857 --> 23:54.026
You don't fucking know me.

23:55.261 --> 23:56.561
I'm going to tell her.

23:57.630 --> 23:59.665
Easy as a cup of coffee.

24:03.869 --> 24:06.939
"Hey, girl, you
want to grab a cup of coffee?"

24:06.972 --> 24:07.873
"Sure.

24:09.275 --> 24:12.778
- I have to tell you something."
- "What is it?"

24:12.812 --> 24:14.280
"It's pretty bad."
"What is it?"

24:14.313 --> 24:16.816
"It's pretty fucking bad."

24:16.849 --> 24:18.784
Wow, you really
drag it out, huh?

24:18.818 --> 24:21.654
And then she would know
all about you.

24:21.687 --> 24:23.355
Then she'd know all about you.

24:25.257 --> 24:26.624
She already does.

24:26.659 --> 24:27.592
No, she doesn't.

24:30.096 --> 24:31.097
Nobody does.

24:32.164 --> 24:33.999
You're a tough guy,
and you're not going to tell

24:34.033 --> 24:36.035
anybody about me,
because you don't want anyone

24:36.068 --> 24:38.771
to know about you, because
if people know about you,

24:38.804 --> 24:40.906
and the things you're involved
in, then people might worry

24:40.940 --> 24:42.141
about you, and where does anyone

24:42.174 --> 24:43.943
get off worrying about you? So.

24:44.944 --> 24:47.813
Relax, because nothing's
going to happen, okay?

24:47.847 --> 24:50.716
We did a nice job
polishing this table though.

24:50.749 --> 24:52.651
You could probably give
your maid the week off.

24:52.685 --> 24:55.688
I can't afford both you
and Lupe, so I chose you.

24:57.256 --> 25:00.626
Oh, and do you think
that all maids are Latina, Greg?

25:02.928 --> 25:05.030
That came out horribly,
I'm sorry.

25:05.064 --> 25:06.899
You just suck at banter.

25:06.932 --> 25:08.868
I'm serious, that was stupid.

25:08.901 --> 25:10.302
Did you mean anything by it?

25:10.336 --> 25:11.337
No.

25:11.370 --> 25:13.005
Then don't worry about it.

25:13.038 --> 25:14.440
How long have you known?

25:14.473 --> 25:16.275
As long as you.

25:16.308 --> 25:19.879
- Right.
- Look, I'm sorry that it happened at all.

25:19.912 --> 25:22.314
Oh what is this? Is this,
is this empathy now, Greg?

25:22.348 --> 25:24.817
No, I'm involved
in this situation too.

25:24.850 --> 25:26.385
Oh, you're in it too?
So then it,

25:26.418 --> 25:28.320
so then it's not empathy,
so then, so then what is it?

25:28.354 --> 25:31.423
- Look.
- Oh, it's self-pity then.

25:31.457 --> 25:33.325
I'm sorry that it happened.

25:33.359 --> 25:35.694
But you didn't know.

25:35.728 --> 25:37.396
- Of course not.
- So you're sorry

25:37.429 --> 25:39.899
for something that
you have no control over,

25:39.932 --> 25:41.834
and you're apologizing
for...

25:41.867 --> 25:44.203
...the random chaos
of the universe.

25:44.236 --> 25:46.472
That's a pretty fucking
healthy ego, Greg.

25:46.505 --> 25:49.308
Still a shitty thing
to say though, I'm sorry.

25:49.341 --> 25:52.444
Well, do you make that racially

25:52.478 --> 25:54.213
insensitive joke to every Latina

25:54.246 --> 25:55.381
courtesan you have over here?

25:55.414 --> 25:57.216
- No.
- Wait, what?

25:57.249 --> 25:58.150
No, I don't.

25:58.184 --> 26:00.052
Oh, well,

26:00.085 --> 26:01.954
what racially insensitive
joke do you make

26:01.987 --> 26:04.723
to every Latina courtesan
you have over here?

26:04.757 --> 26:06.325
That question assumes
certain facts

26:06.358 --> 26:08.327
simply not in evidence.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.095
Better.

26:10.129 --> 26:11.897
Not that you know
you're not free to have whom...

26:11.931 --> 26:13.232
Oh, stop.

26:13.265 --> 26:15.067
I mean, do whatever you want.

26:15.100 --> 26:16.468
We won't see each other anymore.

26:16.502 --> 26:18.137
Oh, you're not going
to see her anymore?

26:19.405 --> 26:21.073
Oh, you won't see me.

26:21.106 --> 26:24.877
Well... she's my friend.

26:24.910 --> 26:26.946
- She is.
- What does that mean?

26:26.979 --> 26:28.781
You've been trying
to purge her from your life...

26:28.814 --> 26:30.382
Yeah,
and you've been taking notes.

26:30.416 --> 26:32.351
You keep saying how you can't
wait to be rid of her.

26:32.384 --> 26:37.056
And you acted so concerned,
so empathetic.

26:37.089 --> 26:40.192
- I am empathetic.
- Acting so interested in my life.

26:40.226 --> 26:41.126
Ana.

26:43.996 --> 26:47.399
Okay, relax, I believe you.

26:50.069 --> 26:51.904
I just wanted to talk.

27:05.384 --> 27:06.418
Okay, fine.

27:08.354 --> 27:09.455
You've been having fun.

27:11.457 --> 27:13.192
Yeah.

27:13.225 --> 27:14.526
Been enjoying it all week.

27:26.071 --> 27:28.274
Did you always used
to cook big Thanksgivings?

27:28.307 --> 27:31.877
Yeah, I did, back when,
when I did.

27:31.910 --> 27:34.847
So, turkey sandwiches with wine?

27:34.880 --> 27:36.949
Perfect. I asked the guy
in the liquor store

27:36.982 --> 27:39.051
specifically
if this wine went well

27:39.084 --> 27:41.854
- with leftover turkey sandwiches.
- What did he say?

27:41.887 --> 27:43.822
"Buy something or get out!"

27:45.057 --> 27:48.060
What am I, a fucking weirdo,
Greg?

27:48.093 --> 27:49.995
- A fucking weirdo like you?
- Of course not.

27:50.029 --> 27:53.098
Stop being so awkwardly
polite, you fucking weirdo.

27:53.132 --> 27:54.566
How can you tell the difference
between me being

27:54.600 --> 27:56.935
awkwardly polite,
and me just being polite?

27:56.969 --> 27:59.038
Because your politeness
gets awkward

27:59.071 --> 28:01.540
when you know you're
about to get in trouble,

28:01.573 --> 28:04.310
not that you were
awkward last week.

28:04.343 --> 28:05.244
No?

28:07.179 --> 28:12.951
No, not awkward, not at all.

28:12.985 --> 28:16.155
I mean I saw you,

28:16.188 --> 28:18.590
and it was wild. It was,

28:18.624 --> 28:22.061
it was fun seeing how
it was all going to play out.

28:23.228 --> 28:24.430
How you were going to play it.

28:25.397 --> 28:26.865
And I was good, huh?

28:26.899 --> 28:29.134
Almost like you were
testing yourself.

28:30.336 --> 28:33.105
I wasn't, trust me,
I was as shocked as you were.

28:38.110 --> 28:42.448
Cool under pressure,
not awkward.

28:43.515 --> 28:45.951
I guess that when
the chips are down,

28:45.984 --> 28:47.386
back's against the wall,

28:47.419 --> 28:49.121
and you're about
to get in trouble,

28:49.154 --> 28:51.156
you managed to hold it
all altogether.

28:51.190 --> 28:52.458
I guess so.

28:52.491 --> 28:54.093
Like when you know
your narcissism

28:54.126 --> 28:56.663
- is about to get you in trouble.
- Narcissism, huh?

28:56.696 --> 28:59.898
Well, I'm no psychologist,
but if it's not narcissism,

28:59.932 --> 29:00.966
it's something.

29:01.934 --> 29:03.435
You were pretty cool yourself.

29:05.204 --> 29:07.139
Occupational hazard.

29:07.172 --> 29:08.207
Sounds rough.

29:10.643 --> 29:14.346
Ego in the guise of empathy,
but... I can't abide

29:14.380 --> 29:17.116
anyone empathizing with me,
right, Greg?

29:17.149 --> 29:19.251
How about people just wanting
to know how you're doing?

29:20.519 --> 29:22.054
Even if it means
you can't have fun

29:22.087 --> 29:23.222
because you're working.

29:23.255 --> 29:24.657
Have to work.

29:24.691 --> 29:26.191
Trip go okay?

29:26.225 --> 29:28.427
Oh, yeah, not horrible, thanks.

29:28.460 --> 29:29.962
Not as quick as yours though.

29:29.995 --> 29:31.563
I dropped what I was doing.

29:32.965 --> 29:34.900
Thank you for texting.

29:39.972 --> 29:42.274
So, they keep the dorms
open during the summer?

29:44.076 --> 29:45.277
I live off campus.

29:47.146 --> 29:48.147
Got a roommate?

29:50.249 --> 29:51.150
Yeah.

29:52.484 --> 29:54.086
She sticking around
for the summer?

29:55.120 --> 29:58.190
Yeah, part of it anyway.

29:58.223 --> 30:00.125
Sounds like you're not
too thrilled with her.

30:05.431 --> 30:06.532
What the fuck are you doing?

30:07.667 --> 30:08.600
Reinforcements.

30:08.635 --> 30:10.369
Oh, my God, stop it.

30:10.402 --> 30:12.404
You're actually like a baby,
get it together.

30:25.652 --> 30:28.020
I'm not acting like anything.

30:28.053 --> 30:29.455
He's an asshole.

30:29.488 --> 30:31.390
He was an asshole
when he bailed on my mother,

30:31.423 --> 30:33.693
and he is an asshole now.

30:33.726 --> 30:34.661
How do you know?

30:35.728 --> 30:38.464
Because everything
worked out fine for him.

30:38.497 --> 30:40.165
She was alone with a kid halfway

30:40.199 --> 30:42.201
around the world,
and for a few years,

30:42.234 --> 30:44.102
it really did work for us.

30:44.136 --> 30:47.272
And here you are,
doing pure blow,

30:47.306 --> 30:48.675
about to graduate
from one of the best

30:48.708 --> 30:51.143
schools in the fucking world.

30:51.176 --> 30:52.077
Whatever.

31:00.352 --> 31:01.520
You think this is pure?

31:01.553 --> 31:03.422
What... Uh, fuck you.

31:04.757 --> 31:06.091
You need something too.

31:06.124 --> 31:07.694
Yeah, I need an Uber.

31:07.727 --> 31:10.128
You're lucky I'm not
falling out of that window

31:10.162 --> 31:13.198
and sprinting down the front
while they're looking for us now.

31:13.232 --> 31:16.201
You're not allowed to,
not in my shoes.

31:16.235 --> 31:17.369
These are my shoes.

31:28.146 --> 31:29.114
Fuck off.

31:33.185 --> 31:34.486
This is a fucking ambush.

31:35.487 --> 31:37.389
My mother's going
to have an aneurism

31:37.422 --> 31:38.624
when he just waltzes in here.

31:38.658 --> 31:40.359
Your mother is going to be fine.

31:42.227 --> 31:44.731
And of course he just lets him
just walk right in.

31:44.764 --> 31:47.099
My God, what did he do to you?

31:48.467 --> 31:51.403
- He left my mother.
- That's it?

31:51.436 --> 31:54.106
You make him seen
like he's some kind of monster.

31:54.139 --> 31:55.808
Not a monster.

31:55.842 --> 31:57.710
Why does he always have
to be seen as a monster?

31:57.744 --> 32:00.279
I don't know,
maybe cut him some slack.

32:01.547 --> 32:03.215
You don't understand.

32:06.318 --> 32:07.519
People leave every day.

32:10.622 --> 32:11.691
Things change.

32:12.825 --> 32:15.728
People leave all the time,
trust me.

32:18.898 --> 32:20.232
Yeah, well...

32:23.569 --> 32:25.337
that sucks.

32:25.370 --> 32:29.408
Well, yeah, maybe he's trying
to make it up to you.

32:30.442 --> 32:31.577
That's what you think.

32:32.578 --> 32:34.246
I mean I don't know him,

32:34.279 --> 32:37.750
but I think he's your father.

32:38.685 --> 32:40.853
I think he's not a monster.

32:41.788 --> 32:44.489
I think even your mother
can let shit go.

32:45.424 --> 32:47.392
And I think that you need
all the good relationships

32:47.426 --> 32:49.328
you can get right now.

32:49.361 --> 32:50.295
Hm.

32:51.463 --> 32:55.635
I think...
that you need to do a bump.

32:55.668 --> 32:57.402
Fuck off.

32:58.303 --> 32:59.438
Be my friend.

33:02.207 --> 33:03.241
God damn it.

33:09.381 --> 33:10.750
He steps out of line.

33:12.250 --> 33:14.887
Hey, you know what,
maybe this is going to be good.

33:14.921 --> 33:17.189
Not all relationships
have to stay the same.

33:18.758 --> 33:21.493
The good ones do, stay the same.

33:21.526 --> 33:24.329
No, the good ones change too.

33:42.815 --> 33:44.349
You are a cynic.

33:44.383 --> 33:46.385
So we're going
to skip over things like,

33:46.418 --> 33:48.220
"Are you healthy?
Are you starving?

33:48.253 --> 33:49.388
Do you have a roof
over your head?"

33:49.421 --> 33:50.823
Well, for now.

33:50.857 --> 33:52.557
I don't know
for how much longer.

33:52.591 --> 33:54.827
Wait, what do you mean?

33:54.861 --> 34:01.634
Well, my roommate threw
a little soiree last weekend

34:01.668 --> 34:08.273
that has Miss. Colette,
my landlady, up in arms.

34:08.306 --> 34:11.342
- Up in arms upset?
- Up in arms going to get a shotgun and chase

34:11.376 --> 34:13.411
both of us bitches
back to Hayward.

34:13.445 --> 34:15.246
You grew up in Hayward?

34:15.280 --> 34:17.349
No, Richmond.

34:18.417 --> 34:21.987
But... Hayward's
probably the closest

34:22.021 --> 34:24.657
we're going to get to without
getting our credit checked.

34:24.690 --> 34:26.458
Wait,
are you behind on your rent too?

34:26.491 --> 34:28.493
She is,
couple of months if you add

34:28.527 --> 34:31.463
the bits and pieces,
since the start of the year,

34:31.496 --> 34:32.732
when I don't cover for her.

34:32.764 --> 34:35.400
But fun's being had by all.

34:36.368 --> 34:38.370
Yeah, it's okay,
I don't like the beach anyway.

34:38.402 --> 34:39.603
By all, huh?

34:39.639 --> 34:41.741
How much fun, exactly?

34:41.774 --> 34:43.542
Relax.

34:43.574 --> 34:45.577
Don't tell me to relax.

34:45.610 --> 34:47.612
She's going to be fine.

34:47.647 --> 34:48.547
If you say so.

34:49.681 --> 34:50.683
Have you spoken with her?

34:51.650 --> 34:53.251
Left a voicemail Sunday night.

34:54.987 --> 34:56.321
You'll hear from her soon.

34:56.353 --> 34:58.356
I know, she's busy having fun.

34:58.390 --> 35:00.626
- Does she work?
- Uh.

35:00.660 --> 35:02.527
Define work?

35:02.561 --> 35:03.796
Does she have a job?

35:06.298 --> 35:07.232
Currently.

35:07.967 --> 35:09.568
Doing what?

35:09.601 --> 35:12.404
- Waitress.
- So, she pays rent?

35:12.437 --> 35:13.472
Yeah.

35:13.505 --> 35:14.941
Yeah, but?

35:14.974 --> 35:18.276
Yeah, but see,
the perks of being

35:18.310 --> 35:20.646
a waitress
is that you make a lot

35:20.680 --> 35:23.315
of cash under the table,
and nobody knows

35:23.348 --> 35:24.717
how much you're
really getting paid,

35:24.751 --> 35:26.418
including your roommate.

35:26.451 --> 35:27.754
You work under the table too.

35:27.787 --> 35:29.055
Yeah, but I pay my bills.

35:29.088 --> 35:30.589
I don't know, Miss...

35:30.622 --> 35:32.424
Miss. Colette is old,
and she's got

35:32.457 --> 35:35.327
nothing to do,
and it's just bits and pieces.

35:36.863 --> 35:39.665
It wouldn't be such
a big deal if...

35:39.699 --> 35:41.566
she wasn't observing
that we were maintaining

35:41.600 --> 35:43.435
our recreational budget.

35:43.468 --> 35:45.437
Uh, but I thought
you said it wasn't we?

35:45.470 --> 35:47.974
Hey, sometimes
I want to have fun too, dad.

35:49.341 --> 35:51.677
That came out horribly wrong.

35:51.711 --> 35:53.378
- Consider us even.
- I would like her

35:53.411 --> 35:55.882
to be busy not having fun,
at a certain point.

35:55.915 --> 35:57.784
Well, just because
you haven't been around her

35:57.817 --> 35:59.584
24/7 for the past few years,

35:59.618 --> 36:01.888
doesn't mean your work
ethic hasn't rubbed off.

36:01.921 --> 36:04.090
She has a work ethic, huh?

36:04.123 --> 36:05.590
When the chips are down.

36:06.893 --> 36:08.060
She's got a stack of chips.

36:08.094 --> 36:09.394
You do too.

36:10.428 --> 36:11.998
Thanks.

36:12.031 --> 36:13.398
She's slippery.

36:13.431 --> 36:14.700
Be tougher.

36:14.734 --> 36:16.368
It's your apartment,
throw her out.

36:16.401 --> 36:17.837
Well, she's on the lease,

36:19.071 --> 36:22.008
or she'll disappear
for four or five days,

36:22.041 --> 36:24.010
and I get to worry about her,

36:24.043 --> 36:26.411
as she ignores my texts,
before she blows back in

36:26.444 --> 36:30.049
with the same clothes she left
in, five pounds lighter,

36:30.082 --> 36:32.852
dick on her breath,
and maybe a bruise or two,

36:32.885 --> 36:34.854
acting like nothing is wrong.

36:34.887 --> 36:36.689
She was happy to see you.

36:36.722 --> 36:38.958
- If you say so.
- I do.

36:38.991 --> 36:41.459
I just would like
to have more of an idea.

36:41.493 --> 36:44.764
Sometimes I get to tour
the local emergency rooms.

36:44.797 --> 36:46.899
Wait, what, really?

36:48.901 --> 36:49.869
Sure.

36:49.902 --> 36:51.070
Bad?

36:51.103 --> 36:52.839
Emergency is right in the title.

36:56.809 --> 36:58.476
I'm her friend.

36:58.510 --> 36:59.979
And she's been through a lot.

37:00.012 --> 37:01.546
She has?

37:01.580 --> 37:03.816
Well, that's all relative.

37:03.850 --> 37:06.384
It's like my grandmother says.

37:08.520 --> 37:14.359
People say, "My hangnail is
more painful than your cancer."

37:16.494 --> 37:17.596
All right, hang on.

37:18.764 --> 37:24.904
People will tell you my pad...
padra... <i>padrastro.</i>

37:24.937 --> 37:26.038
Hangnail.

37:26.072 --> 37:27.073
- Hangnail?
- Mm-hm.

37:28.074 --> 37:30.109
People will tell you my hangnail

37:30.142 --> 37:33.378
is more painful
than your cancer.

37:36.716 --> 37:38.617
Mm-hm.

37:39.852 --> 37:41.187
My Spanish blows.

37:45.807 --> 37:49.811
No, she is not my mom,
she is my grandmother.

37:50.730 --> 37:53.900
- Sounds rough.
- Mm, sounds rough.

37:53.933 --> 37:54.901
It does.

37:56.869 --> 37:58.570
How is she?

37:58.603 --> 37:59.672
Your grandmother?

37:59.705 --> 38:00.605
She's fine.

38:00.640 --> 38:01.641
She does yoga.

38:02.808 --> 38:04.043
She's younger than you.

38:04.076 --> 38:06.578
Good, wait, what?

38:06.611 --> 38:09.514
How... that, that's,
that's not possible, right?

38:09.547 --> 38:11.717
How old do you think I am?

38:11.751 --> 38:12.652
I don't know.

38:14.586 --> 38:16.588
You certainly are meaner
than your pictures.

38:16.621 --> 38:17.522
Oh.

38:18.858 --> 38:20.525
You look terrific.

38:20.558 --> 38:21.827
Being an expat suits you.

38:22.828 --> 38:23.763
Thank you.

38:25.597 --> 38:27.133
The salt and pepper suits you.

38:27.166 --> 38:28.935
Oh, come on.

38:28.968 --> 38:30.535
Are you still
deflecting compliments

38:30.568 --> 38:31.904
like you think it's charming?

38:31.938 --> 38:33.706
You're right, thank you.

38:41.213 --> 38:44.216
So, you have to stick
around for school, huh?

38:45.117 --> 38:47.153
Yeah, I have labs due,

38:47.186 --> 38:49.889
and exams in two weeks,
and yeah.

38:51.523 --> 38:54.592
I'm,
I'm sorry I brought it up.

38:54.627 --> 38:56.629
You didn't bring it up.

38:56.662 --> 38:58.030
I brought it up.

38:58.064 --> 38:59.699
Still.

38:59.732 --> 39:00.900
It comes up, it pops up,

39:00.933 --> 39:02.835
you can't stop it
from popping up.

39:03.736 --> 39:04.670
I suppose.

39:05.738 --> 39:07.773
First holidays after something
like that happens

39:07.807 --> 39:10.810
is always... rough,

39:10.843 --> 39:13.746
and...
and it just happened.

39:16.015 --> 39:17.917
It happened like a month ago.

39:17.950 --> 39:19.251
It just happened.

39:20.152 --> 39:21.519
Almost two months ago.

39:21.553 --> 39:22.955
Come on.

39:22.989 --> 39:24.090
She was 74.

39:25.291 --> 39:26.192
Esme.

39:31.764 --> 39:32.732
Okay.

39:36.002 --> 39:37.703
It just happened.

39:37.737 --> 39:40.006
And the first holidays
after something like that

39:40.039 --> 39:41.774
happens is?

39:41.807 --> 39:43.575
We don't have to talk about it.

39:43.608 --> 39:45.678
- It's okay.
- No.

39:45.711 --> 39:46.812
It's okay, Greg.

39:48.147 --> 39:49.782
How've you been?

39:49.815 --> 39:51.684
Pretty good. Busy.

39:51.717 --> 39:53.152
You got promoted again, right?

39:53.185 --> 39:57.156
Yeah, more weekends gone,
but it's... it's good.

39:57.189 --> 39:58.924
It's really good.

39:58.958 --> 39:59.859
Good?

40:02.762 --> 40:04.263
How about you?

40:04.296 --> 40:05.297
How about me?

40:06.198 --> 40:07.900
How are you?

40:07.933 --> 40:09.635
I'm fine.

40:09.668 --> 40:11.270
Are you fine?

40:11.303 --> 40:12.204
Sure.

40:16.075 --> 40:17.043
Are you happy?

40:18.644 --> 40:19.712
What do you mean?

40:19.745 --> 40:20.646
Greg.

40:21.981 --> 40:23.015
I'm fine.

40:24.850 --> 40:26.952
It's still the first
question I want to ask you.

40:27.920 --> 40:30.790
- Is that a compliment?
- Yes, it is, actually.

40:32.958 --> 40:33.993
Don't worry about me.

40:34.994 --> 40:37.897
Oh, it's not the most
unpleasant thing I do.

40:37.930 --> 40:38.831
Thank you.

40:40.633 --> 40:42.068
It is good to see you.

40:42.101 --> 40:43.002
It is?

40:43.035 --> 40:44.203
Christ!

40:44.236 --> 40:46.604
You're right.

40:48.140 --> 40:49.942
It's good to see you.

40:49.975 --> 40:53.345
So, you are talking to people
about your grandmother?

40:55.114 --> 40:56.048
Sure.

40:58.751 --> 41:00.152
Really?

41:00.186 --> 41:02.088
The roommate?

41:02.121 --> 41:04.023
Yeah, my roommate.

41:04.056 --> 41:06.759
My roommate's actually not
that bad to talk about it with.

41:06.792 --> 41:08.260
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:09.428 --> 41:12.031
You know, she's behaving.

41:13.065 --> 41:15.267
Problem is I feel
like it's just a window.

41:16.702 --> 41:18.871
Besides, I don't have
any other relatives, so.

41:18.904 --> 41:20.106
I'm sorry.

41:20.564 --> 41:24.484
Why? She wasn't your grandma, hangnail.

41:24.777 --> 41:27.146
Oh, come on,
it sucks to be alone.

41:27.179 --> 41:29.315
I'm not alone, you're alone.

41:29.348 --> 41:31.817
Yeah, I guess I am.

41:31.851 --> 41:33.085
That sucks.

41:34.086 --> 41:35.187
Sometimes it does.

41:36.956 --> 41:39.859
You have to remind yourself
that it's just for today,

41:39.892 --> 41:42.661
that you're just fighting
through the darkness today,

41:42.695 --> 41:44.029
and that tomorrow is a new...

41:44.063 --> 41:45.898
Happiness is a choice.

41:45.931 --> 41:48.701
Sure,
and you keep reminding yourself

41:48.734 --> 41:51.003
that you're going
to get through it,

41:51.036 --> 41:52.738
that you are getting through it.

41:56.842 --> 41:58.010
And then you take a pill...

41:58.043 --> 41:59.345
...or two.

41:59.378 --> 42:01.313
And the pill helps.

42:01.347 --> 42:02.715
They do sometimes.

42:04.150 --> 42:06.051
Okay, enough of that.

42:06.085 --> 42:08.721
Though should you maybe
go check up on her?

42:08.754 --> 42:11.023
No, I'm not doing that, relax.

42:11.056 --> 42:12.191
Long time.

42:12.224 --> 42:13.826
She's in the bathroom, Greg,

42:13.859 --> 42:15.794
she didn't flee the premises,
I think.

42:15.828 --> 42:17.163
So do you think
you're going to stick

42:17.196 --> 42:18.664
around next year after school?

42:19.999 --> 42:20.900
Maybe.

42:22.501 --> 42:24.003
Maybe not.

42:24.036 --> 42:25.838
You're going to be fine
wherever you go,

42:25.871 --> 42:29.408
but don't stay here
just because it's easier.

42:30.876 --> 42:32.111
Always do the harder thing.

42:33.512 --> 42:34.847
She seem okay to you?

42:36.248 --> 42:38.284
What do you mean, okay?

42:38.317 --> 42:40.819
I mean does she have anything
lined up for next year?

42:40.853 --> 42:42.721
Does she have anything
lined up for this summer?

42:42.755 --> 42:43.923
Anything at all?

42:43.956 --> 42:47.193
No, no yet, from what I gather.

42:47.226 --> 42:48.794
Does she know
where she's going to live?

42:48.827 --> 42:50.329
Is she going to come back
and live with you?

42:50.362 --> 42:51.997
- Is she going to live...
- My God, take a breath,

42:52.031 --> 42:55.100
- so many questions.
- Yeah, she's...

42:55.134 --> 42:56.902
...she's going to live with Ana.

42:56.936 --> 42:58.237
Oh, yeah, Ana.

42:58.270 --> 43:00.105
Yeah, certainly,
why wouldn't she?

43:00.139 --> 43:01.373
I don't know.

43:01.407 --> 43:02.841
Who's Ana?

43:02.875 --> 43:05.411
Her roommate, Greg.

43:06.378 --> 43:07.980
Shannon's in good hands.

43:08.013 --> 43:11.050
Three exams in one day, idiot.

43:11.083 --> 43:12.818
Well, I hope
you learned your lesson.

43:12.851 --> 43:14.887
That's what
my girlfriend at the time said

43:14.920 --> 43:16.188
when I tried
to have coffee with her

43:16.222 --> 43:18.390
between the first
and the second exam,

43:18.424 --> 43:20.226
"You could have
changed the schedule."

43:20.259 --> 43:22.194
Girlfriend? Mm.

43:22.228 --> 43:23.162
At the time.

43:24.196 --> 43:26.899
Future wife, current ex-wife.

43:27.900 --> 43:29.902
Current ex-wife?

43:29.935 --> 43:31.904
- Try two.
- I could barely hold the mug,

43:31.937 --> 43:34.073
I was so wound up.

43:34.106 --> 43:38.077
"Welp, I hope you
learned your lesson," she said.

43:38.110 --> 43:43.015
Welp, did you?
Learn your lesson?

43:43.048 --> 43:46.118
Welp,
we were married for ten years.

43:46.151 --> 43:47.886
Ten years?

43:47.920 --> 43:49.989
Should have been
married for three.

43:50.022 --> 43:52.057
Not everyone has your patience,
Stacy.

43:52.992 --> 43:56.028
Sometimes I think I showed
too much patients, Greg.

43:56.061 --> 43:57.229
That's not...

44:00.566 --> 44:02.368
I think you showed
just the right amount.

44:03.502 --> 44:04.403
Any kids?

44:06.272 --> 44:07.172
No?

44:08.173 --> 44:09.575
No.

44:09.608 --> 44:10.843
That's good then.

44:12.444 --> 44:14.213
Need any help?

44:14.246 --> 44:15.381
Not a chance.

44:31.430 --> 44:32.931
Uh, sorry.

44:35.567 --> 44:37.303
What are you sorry for?

44:37.336 --> 44:38.937
I ask you too many questions.

44:42.508 --> 44:44.243
- Hey.
- Hey.

44:45.244 --> 44:46.612
Are you okay?

44:46.646 --> 44:47.513
Mm-hm.

44:51.950 --> 44:54.186
And your roommate
is gone for break.

44:54.219 --> 44:59.091
Yes, the nightmare is
half way across the planet.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.234
My God, finally.

45:12.338 --> 45:14.340
So, ten minutes
means half an hour now.

45:14.373 --> 45:16.108
Like probably been 15.

45:16.141 --> 45:18.944
Hold up, we had to get dressed.

45:21.046 --> 45:22.381
You invited both of them?

45:22.414 --> 45:24.917
Yeah,
you didn't want that?

45:24.950 --> 45:26.385
I just thought that you wouldn't

45:26.418 --> 45:28.020
want to be like a fifth wheel.

45:28.053 --> 45:29.488
Safety in numbers, Ana.

45:29.521 --> 45:31.156
Think, think about it this way,

45:31.190 --> 45:33.125
there's no like fifth wheel.

45:33.158 --> 45:34.426
What?

45:34.460 --> 45:36.528
She just said that, Ellery.

45:36.562 --> 45:38.397
You guys smoked before
you got here, didn't you?

45:38.430 --> 45:40.299
- Jesus.
- Assholes.

45:41.433 --> 45:43.068
Why, you want some?

45:43.102 --> 45:45.437
- Ellery.
- Whatever, you're saved.

45:46.639 --> 45:48.173
- Relax.
- We did not

45:48.207 --> 45:50.275
need saving, okay?

45:50.309 --> 45:53.579
We just needed reinforcements.

45:53.612 --> 45:55.514
So, drinks!

45:55.547 --> 45:57.916
Shan,
we got to get to the table.

45:57.950 --> 45:59.184
They can wait.

45:59.218 --> 46:00.919
But are you worried about her?

46:00.953 --> 46:03.656
Or are you worried
about how she feels about you?

46:03.690 --> 46:05.958
Both, Jesus.

46:05.991 --> 46:07.426
Ego in the guise of empathy.

46:11.363 --> 46:14.199
Just keep leaving voicemails,
you'll be fine.

46:15.300 --> 46:16.468
And are you going to be fine?

46:16.502 --> 46:20.239
Fuck you, I am fine.

46:24.009 --> 46:26.311
And she's going to be fine,
you'll both be fine.

46:28.247 --> 46:29.248
She tell you that?

46:30.215 --> 46:32.050
She's not exactly over it
like that Greg,

46:32.084 --> 46:34.219
but you're her father.

46:38.223 --> 46:39.491
How much time do we have left?

46:41.059 --> 46:42.428
Fifteen minutes or so.

46:43.763 --> 46:45.264
Fifteen minutes or so.

46:49.234 --> 46:50.169
Careful.

46:50.202 --> 46:51.470
You'll get your hair wet.

46:59.378 --> 47:01.480
You're a nice guy, Greg.

47:01.513 --> 47:03.182
All right.

47:07.586 --> 47:09.521
Waterboarding with compliments.

47:10.422 --> 47:12.524
Why does that
bother you so much?

47:12.558 --> 47:15.194
Because I really don't think
I'm that nice a guy,

47:15.227 --> 47:16.328
because I don't think
you should be

47:16.361 --> 47:18.030
so special to be a nice guy.

47:18.063 --> 47:19.531
I mean,
would a nice guy do something...

47:19.565 --> 47:21.668
Well, I've seen my fair share.

47:23.770 --> 47:25.037
Your bar is low.

47:26.405 --> 47:28.675
No, it isn't.

47:30.777 --> 47:33.579
Okay, thanks.

47:33.612 --> 47:34.580
You're welcome.

47:36.381 --> 47:37.717
Wash my back?

47:37.750 --> 47:38.651
Sure.

47:39.551 --> 47:41.353
See? Nice guy.

47:41.386 --> 47:44.089
Yeah, right.

47:44.122 --> 47:46.258
- That was a trick.
- Yes.

47:48.494 --> 47:51.430
Well,
now that we're done yelling,

47:52.364 --> 47:55.467
since we're talking now, can I?

47:55.501 --> 47:57.369
- Oh.
- Yeah.

47:57.402 --> 47:58.604
You want that back?

47:59.672 --> 48:00.740
I did give it to you.

48:02.207 --> 48:03.308
That wrapping paper though.

48:03.342 --> 48:05.110
I always outsource my wrapping.

48:07.579 --> 48:09.348
You're too hard on yourself.

48:10.516 --> 48:12.384
Maybe other people
aren't hard enough.

48:12.417 --> 48:14.453
- On you?
- Ha!

48:14.486 --> 48:15.420
That too.

48:15.454 --> 48:18.156
No, on themselves.

48:19.191 --> 48:20.559
Both things can be true.

48:21.493 --> 48:23.395
Both of those things
usually are true.

48:28.534 --> 48:31.103
Wait, did you just say
that you don't think people

48:31.136 --> 48:32.504
are hard enough on you?

48:32.538 --> 48:33.505
I was kidding.

48:34.406 --> 48:35.742
Bullshit.

48:35.775 --> 48:37.744
You believe it.

48:37.777 --> 48:39.511
I think you think you only have

48:39.545 --> 48:41.313
a right to be happy
when you're miserable.

48:41.346 --> 48:44.817
Pretty philosophical
for a biochemistry major.

48:44.851 --> 48:47.486
Hey, biochemistry graduate.

48:54.393 --> 48:56.194
You're going to tear
your rotator cuff.

48:58.163 --> 48:59.231
Nice picture.

49:00.599 --> 49:02.835
<i>And I'm sure it doesn't
help you to carry it so tightly.</i>

49:02.869 --> 49:04.469
<i>Carry what?</i>

49:04.503 --> 49:05.404
Oh.

49:05.437 --> 49:06.204
Guilt.

49:07.306 --> 49:12.611
You carry it like a gun,
or a prize.

49:14.781 --> 49:16.749
Nice picture, Greg.

49:16.783 --> 49:18.483
Thanks.

49:18.517 --> 49:22.187
In a way, I suppose,
I've convinced myself

49:22.220 --> 49:24.757
that by always being
so hard on myself,

49:24.791 --> 49:27.627
people can't think that
I'm being too easy on myself.

49:27.660 --> 49:29.161
Why do you care so much

49:29.194 --> 49:30.830
about what other
people think about you?

49:32.665 --> 49:33.866
Because people who don't care

49:33.900 --> 49:35.400
what other people
think about them

49:35.434 --> 49:37.569
at all are animals.

49:37.603 --> 49:39.237
Aren't you supposed to care
what people think,

49:39.271 --> 49:41.540
at least to keep
from murdering them?

49:41.573 --> 49:45.712
It's a pretty sentimental
picture, don't you think?

49:45.745 --> 49:47.412
- Ana.
- It's a pretty

49:47.446 --> 49:49.615
fucking sentimental picture,

49:49.649 --> 49:52.819
for such an urbane apartment,
Greg, don't you think?

49:57.657 --> 50:00.125
Yeah, but you care too much.

50:00.893 --> 50:02.427
You carry it too much.

50:05.430 --> 50:06.833
If you think you're a nice guy,

50:06.866 --> 50:08.868
then that's what matters, right?

50:08.901 --> 50:10.135
If you think it.

50:11.236 --> 50:12.772
I guess so.

50:12.805 --> 50:15.407
So, do you?

50:16.709 --> 50:18.477
No, I don't.

50:19.979 --> 50:21.781
I'm very complicated.

50:21.814 --> 50:23.515
Bullshit, complicated.

50:23.548 --> 50:24.817
You just need to relax.

50:24.851 --> 50:27.654
Don't tell me to re...

50:27.687 --> 50:29.756
I'm complicated.

50:33.993 --> 50:34.894
You're a prisoner.

50:36.963 --> 50:40.633
Please, tell me
that you just put it there,

50:40.667 --> 50:42.367
you just put it there,
didn't you?

50:43.736 --> 50:44.837
Yes.

50:44.871 --> 50:47.339
You're so full of shit.

50:48.306 --> 50:51.209
- I did.
- You're a fucking liar.

50:51.243 --> 50:52.611
How do you even know it's her?

50:52.645 --> 50:55.715
Because it looks
exactly like her,

50:55.748 --> 50:57.917
except shrunken down
by 12 years,

50:57.950 --> 51:00.585
and without her abandonment
issues spackled on.

51:04.322 --> 51:08.360
And the same nose,
and the same dogshit,

51:08.393 --> 51:10.697
smug sense of entitlement.

51:10.730 --> 51:14.266
I didn't want you to know
I had a daughter, big deal.

51:14.299 --> 51:15.935
You're a fucking psycho.

51:17.269 --> 51:18.470
That's proportionate.

51:18.503 --> 51:19.672
What did you do?

51:20.907 --> 51:22.842
Did you put down the picture

51:22.875 --> 51:26.946
every Thursday night
when I came,

51:26.979 --> 51:29.882
and then stow it
in a safe place,

51:29.916 --> 51:32.852
and then put it
back after I left?

51:34.020 --> 51:37.556
So, is this why you're
not married anymore?

51:37.589 --> 51:39.458
No family.

51:39.491 --> 51:41.828
Were you off being urbane, Greg?

51:41.861 --> 51:44.296
Oh, no,
I don't think I could do this

51:44.329 --> 51:45.732
if I were married,
I don't think.

51:45.765 --> 51:46.999
If you say so.

51:47.033 --> 51:48.701
- How long...
- How long were you...

51:48.735 --> 51:50.937
We don't have to do that part.

51:52.739 --> 51:54.640
Let's talk about your face.

51:54.674 --> 51:55.675
Why?

51:55.708 --> 51:57.476
Because I like it.

51:57.509 --> 51:59.277
It's nothing compared
to your face.

51:59.311 --> 52:01.613
Can one quantify faces,
math guy?

52:01.647 --> 52:03.615
Something tells me
you know that one can.

52:04.784 --> 52:06.652
One can quantify anything.

52:06.686 --> 52:10.056
What a chore, the logistics,

52:10.089 --> 52:12.792
the weekly reminder
on the phone.

52:12.825 --> 52:16.863
Put the picture away
every Thursday at 7:58 p.m.

52:16.896 --> 52:18.898
No, eight,
you were never on time.

52:18.931 --> 52:20.332
Oh.

52:21.968 --> 52:23.703
Well, we both have nice faces.

52:23.736 --> 52:25.671
Only one of us looks better
than our pictures though.

52:25.705 --> 52:27.907
Oh, he's a charmer.

52:27.940 --> 52:29.407
So, you can still get charmed?

52:29.441 --> 52:30.943
You have never done this before.

52:31.878 --> 52:32.912
Grow up.

52:32.945 --> 52:34.914
Me, grow up? Wow!

52:34.947 --> 52:36.448
That's one for the win.

52:36.481 --> 52:37.616
Jesus Christ,
no wonder she doesn't

52:37.650 --> 52:38.885
want to fucking talk to you.

52:38.918 --> 52:40.953
You're off center, dude.

52:40.987 --> 52:42.955
What did you do?

52:42.989 --> 52:44.657
Did you look me up?

52:44.690 --> 52:47.693
Search me on the internet,
so you could request me?

52:47.727 --> 52:49.494
Yeah, with your booker.

52:49.528 --> 52:50.428
Fuck you.

52:51.631 --> 52:53.099
Did you stake out your daughter,

52:53.132 --> 52:55.101
so you could stake out
her friends to see

52:55.134 --> 52:57.069
which one to befriend?

52:57.103 --> 52:58.671
What?

52:58.704 --> 53:00.673
What you're saying
makes no sense,

53:00.706 --> 53:02.074
it is not rational.

53:02.108 --> 53:03.876
Or was it easier
to see me when you went

53:03.910 --> 53:05.678
to go ambush her
when she didn't return

53:05.711 --> 53:07.345
any of your voicemails.

53:07.379 --> 53:08.815
I do pay rent on the place.

53:08.848 --> 53:10.683
Half the rent, motherfucker.

53:10.716 --> 53:11.851
Only half?

53:11.884 --> 53:13.853
You better back up again.

53:15.721 --> 53:17.690
It was very nice to meet you,
Greg.

53:17.723 --> 53:21.894
Did you Google me
and then follow me?

53:29.969 --> 53:32.839
<i>And then,
after you discovered me,</i>

53:32.872 --> 53:34.439
<i>after all your research.</i>

53:34.472 --> 53:35.775
<i>You're delusional.</i>

53:35.808 --> 53:37.844
<i>You're a fucking asshole.</i>

53:37.877 --> 53:39.679
<i>Lighten up.</i>

53:39.712 --> 53:42.682
<i>I pieced it together,
I tried not to make it personal.</i>

53:44.784 --> 53:47.552
So, next Thursday?

53:49.521 --> 53:51.757
Looking forward to it.

53:51.791 --> 53:52.892
Looking forward.

53:57.930 --> 53:59.397
Did you order yet?

53:59.431 --> 54:01.533
No, not that we shouldn't have.

54:01.566 --> 54:03.069
Sit down. You're being rude.

54:03.102 --> 54:04.170
Oh, I'm being rude?

54:04.203 --> 54:05.503
It's okay.

54:08.140 --> 54:10.475
Um, and who might
these three be?

54:10.508 --> 54:13.545
These three might be my friends.

54:13.578 --> 54:16.849
Oh, I figured since
you invited your own guest,

54:16.883 --> 54:19.085
I could have
some guests of my own.

54:19.118 --> 54:21.453
Sorry we're late,
we came as quick as we could.

54:21.486 --> 54:23.689
No, forgiven,
this was impromptu.

54:23.723 --> 54:24.690
No worries.

54:26.524 --> 54:28.393
Dad,
this is Ellery Hughes.

54:30.196 --> 54:31.731
And this is Shannon's roommate,

54:31.764 --> 54:33.199
Ana Izquierdo,

54:33.232 --> 54:34.532
- Izquierdo?
- Uh-huh.

54:35.701 --> 54:36.601
May I?

54:38.104 --> 54:41.140
Ana, nice to meet you, Ana.

54:41.173 --> 54:43.441
It's very nice to meet you,
Mr. Hagen.

54:46.012 --> 54:47.479
Nice to meet you, sir.

54:47.512 --> 54:49.447
And Gabriel Armijo.

54:49.481 --> 54:50.650
Nice to meet you all.

54:52.919 --> 54:56.088
I am going to need
another mojito, please.

54:56.122 --> 54:57.723
Of course.

54:57.757 --> 55:00.192
What? I'm a grownup.

55:00.226 --> 55:01.928
You don't need another mojito.

55:01.961 --> 55:03.629
She's a grownup?

55:03.663 --> 55:05.631
Yeah,
you might have missed that.

55:06.799 --> 55:08.466
I'll give you all
a minute or so?

55:08.500 --> 55:09.534
No, it's okay.

55:09.567 --> 55:10.903
We're late, we can catch up.

55:10.937 --> 55:14.572
We are all business,
and I am famished.

55:14.606 --> 55:16.742
- Dude.
- No, it's, it's okay.

55:16.776 --> 55:18.744
- Take your time.
- Thank you, Ms. Cavana.

55:18.778 --> 55:22.114
Oh, um, one of those,
all business.

55:22.148 --> 55:23.950
Certainly, anyone else?

55:23.983 --> 55:26.085
No, I'm good with my wine,
thank you.

55:26.118 --> 55:27.219
I'm good.

55:27.253 --> 55:29.789
Oh, come on, these are so good.

55:29.822 --> 55:30.890
I said I was good.

55:32.124 --> 55:34.592
Two more mojitos, two?

55:34.627 --> 55:35.593
No?

55:36.862 --> 55:37.964
It's your life.

55:37.997 --> 55:40.766
It is her life, so Shannon,

55:40.800 --> 55:42.702
looks like you and your
boyfriend will just have to be

55:42.735 --> 55:45.771
in the minority
with the exotic cocktails.

55:45.805 --> 55:50.109
Well, okay,
so that's just wrong.

55:51.844 --> 55:53.511
I'll come back.

55:53.545 --> 55:57.783
Ellery's not Shannon's
boyfriend, Gabriel is.

55:57.817 --> 55:59.952
Oh, ah, my mistake.

55:59.986 --> 56:05.057
And just so you know,
he's not her brother either.

56:05.091 --> 56:07.159
- Really, Shannon?
- What?

56:08.627 --> 56:10.162
When did you two start dating?

56:10.196 --> 56:12.631
Uh, four months?

56:14.166 --> 56:15.668
Five months.

56:15.701 --> 56:18.738
We have been
dating for five months,

56:18.771 --> 56:20.673
not that you would know that,

56:20.706 --> 56:22.308
or are you just surprised

56:22.341 --> 56:24.710
that I would date
somebody like Gabriel?

56:24.744 --> 56:26.544
Minority choices,
or something like that?

56:26.578 --> 56:28.214
- Whoa.
- Shannon.

56:28.247 --> 56:31.183
I'm not surprised you would
date anybody, sweetheart.

56:31.217 --> 56:32.685
What does that mean?

56:32.718 --> 56:34.920
What does sweetheart mean?

56:34.954 --> 56:37.256
Look, I made a mistake,
I took a guess

56:37.289 --> 56:39.557
and guessed wrong, that's all.

56:39.591 --> 56:42.028
Yeah, well,
you shouldn't have to guess.

56:42.061 --> 56:43.262
I agree.

56:46.065 --> 56:47.599
Off to the bathroom again?

56:50.236 --> 56:51.971
You should know
what's going on with me.

56:53.072 --> 56:54.340
You should know that I have been

56:54.373 --> 56:56.909
dating Gabriel for five months.

56:56.942 --> 56:59.311
- You should know that.
- Well, technically,

56:59.345 --> 57:00.880
Gabriel didn't know it either.

57:02.381 --> 57:03.282
Greg.

57:04.616 --> 57:05.718
Shannon, sit down.

57:06.952 --> 57:08.754
Do you count New Years?

57:08.788 --> 57:11.924
Okay, auspicious beginning.

57:11.957 --> 57:14.093
You can't expect to waltz back
in and not take any shrapnel.

57:14.126 --> 57:15.795
How much shrapnel am I supposed

57:15.828 --> 57:17.196
to take before I'm allowed?

57:18.164 --> 57:20.332
You know what?
First thing's first,

57:20.366 --> 57:23.702
Gabriel, I'm sorry.

57:23.736 --> 57:24.904
For what, sir?

57:24.937 --> 57:26.772
For my confusion.

57:26.806 --> 57:28.808
Uh, no worries,
she's sitting in between us,

57:28.841 --> 57:31.177
that's like... a trick question.

57:31.210 --> 57:33.145
Thank you, Gabriel.

57:33.179 --> 57:35.247
Yeah, she has set you up, dude.

57:40.653 --> 57:42.955
So, you're Ana's boyfriend?

57:42.988 --> 57:45.124
- Yeah, that's right.
- Well.

57:45.157 --> 57:46.292
So, you're both juniors?

57:46.325 --> 57:48.894
Younger men, I approve.

57:50.696 --> 57:52.198
How long have you been dating?

57:52.231 --> 57:54.233
- A year.
- Off and on.

57:54.266 --> 57:57.937
A year, so you're serious?

57:57.970 --> 57:59.872
I guess so.

58:03.909 --> 58:05.711
So, Gabriel,
what are you studying?

58:05.744 --> 58:06.812
Economics.

58:06.846 --> 58:08.080
All business.

58:08.114 --> 58:09.782
What's your focus?

58:09.815 --> 58:10.950
Um, third world development.

58:10.983 --> 58:13.986
Ah, crucially important.

58:14.019 --> 58:15.154
Ellery, what's your major?

58:15.187 --> 58:17.189
Hold on.

58:17.223 --> 58:18.190
Let me guess.

58:19.091 --> 58:20.392
- All...
- Business.

58:20.426 --> 58:22.094
There you go.

58:23.362 --> 58:25.998
Dad, you're being rude.

58:26.031 --> 58:28.200
Come on, it was a joke, right,
Ellery?

58:28.234 --> 58:29.235
Yeah, no worries.

58:29.268 --> 58:30.803
See, no worries.

58:30.836 --> 58:32.905
No, it's rude.

58:32.938 --> 58:34.440
Say sorry now.

58:34.473 --> 58:37.109
- For what?
- For being a fucking asshole.

58:37.143 --> 58:39.245
For lying to me for a year.

58:39.278 --> 58:41.046
For making me
believe you tonight,

58:41.080 --> 58:43.048
and for being a fucking asshole.

58:43.082 --> 58:44.283
I was worried about her.

58:44.316 --> 58:45.951
And what were you going to do?
What were you

58:45.985 --> 58:47.820
going to have me do?

58:47.853 --> 58:49.989
I don't know,
she wasn't talking to me.

58:50.022 --> 58:52.791
You were going to have me
rescue her because you couldn't?

58:52.825 --> 58:54.260
I thought you said
she didn't need to be rescued.

58:54.293 --> 58:58.697
She doesn't, although she might,
from you.

58:58.731 --> 59:00.432
Look, you know that isn't true.

59:00.466 --> 59:01.901
I don't know that.

59:01.934 --> 59:03.702
You do know that.

59:03.736 --> 59:06.071
- I got shut out of her life.
- You walked out.

59:06.105 --> 59:07.273
I got shut out.

59:07.306 --> 59:09.408
By who, her mother?

59:09.441 --> 59:11.810
Her mother doesn't talk
badly about you.

59:11.844 --> 59:14.246
She has never spoken
badly about you.

59:16.048 --> 59:20.352
Her mother is over you,
so don't use that as an excuse.

59:20.386 --> 59:22.788
- I'm not.
- No one poisoned

59:22.821 --> 59:24.156
Shannon against you,

59:24.190 --> 59:25.457
except for you.

59:25.491 --> 59:27.860
You shut you out.

59:27.893 --> 59:29.028
You left.

59:29.061 --> 59:30.229
I didn't leave.

59:31.130 --> 59:33.732
It wasn't working.
My wife got a great

59:33.766 --> 59:35.201
opportunity,
and she had to take it.

59:35.234 --> 59:37.036
It happened to be
half way across the world.

59:37.069 --> 59:38.804
I was supposed
to stand in her way?

59:38.837 --> 59:40.139
We weren't going to work.

59:40.172 --> 59:41.740
And your daughter
couldn't understand that?

59:41.774 --> 59:43.008
She was ten.

59:43.943 --> 59:45.344
She chose sides,
and that was it.

59:45.377 --> 59:47.479
You left, who does that?

59:47.513 --> 59:50.082
I stayed, and people do that,

59:50.115 --> 59:52.251
because not doing
something is almost

59:52.284 --> 59:54.153
always easier
than doing something,

59:54.186 --> 59:57.890
except...
except it's almost always worse.

59:57.923 --> 59:59.758
Whatever.

59:59.792 --> 01:00:01.460
And you apologize,
and nobody

01:00:01.493 --> 01:00:03.262
accepts your apologies,
and deep down,

01:00:03.295 --> 01:00:06.165
yeah, you know your apologies
hold no currency.

01:00:06.198 --> 01:00:07.833
But you also resent
the fact that no one

01:00:07.866 --> 01:00:09.368
is taking your apologies,

01:00:09.401 --> 01:00:11.537
and you wonder how long
is it going to take?

01:00:11.570 --> 01:00:13.906
You ask yourself, "How long
am I supposed to keep trying?"

01:00:13.939 --> 01:00:16.208
You're never supposed
to stop trying.

01:00:16.242 --> 01:00:17.810
At what point
am I allowed to have

01:00:17.843 --> 01:00:20.045
my fill of non-answers
and monosyllables,

01:00:20.079 --> 01:00:22.848
and avoidance attitude when
I'm not flat out being ignored?

01:00:22.881 --> 01:00:25.017
How long am I supposed
to take the high road?

01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:26.518
Forever.

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:29.888
Then you're stronger than I am.

01:00:29.922 --> 01:00:31.423
She's a kid.

01:00:31.457 --> 01:00:33.392
She was 12 years ago,
she's not now.

01:00:33.425 --> 01:00:34.893
She hasn't been for a while.

01:00:34.927 --> 01:00:36.528
- Then she's made her choice.
- No,

01:00:36.562 --> 01:00:39.398
see that's it, I gave up
back then, I haven't now.

01:00:39.431 --> 01:00:42.268
I don't give a shit.

01:00:42.301 --> 01:00:44.837
You don't?
That's why you're smacking me,

01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:46.905
and throwing things at my head.

01:00:46.939 --> 01:00:48.040
You used me.

01:00:48.073 --> 01:00:50.009
What, more than usual?

01:00:52.077 --> 01:00:54.280
Look, you need to leave,
the hour's up,

01:00:54.313 --> 01:00:56.115
please, just go.

01:00:59.585 --> 01:01:03.022
Well, I'm going to get going.

01:01:03.055 --> 01:01:04.490
Get going?

01:01:04.523 --> 01:01:07.059
Okay. Oh, hang on.

01:01:10.596 --> 01:01:13.332
You're kidding me, kidding me!

01:01:13.365 --> 01:01:16.168
- I just thought graduation...
- You're kidding me.

01:01:16.201 --> 01:01:18.470
- Is that bad, did I cross a line?
- Are you kidding me?

01:01:18.504 --> 01:01:21.974
- I just thought that...
- Just stop qualifying things.

01:01:22.007 --> 01:01:23.008
I'm opening it.

01:01:24.043 --> 01:01:26.612
Just give me a reason, just,
just tell me why.

01:01:26.646 --> 01:01:29.114
I'm trying to get back
into her life.

01:01:29.148 --> 01:01:31.150
Through infiltration?
It's false.

01:01:31.183 --> 01:01:33.285
Why, who cares how we reconnect?

01:01:33.319 --> 01:01:35.220
Well, you should have
figured out the secret years ago,

01:01:35.254 --> 01:01:37.556
it would have saved you a bunch
of unanswered voicemails.

01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:39.925
Hey, look,
I get that you're not happy

01:01:39.958 --> 01:01:42.261
right now,
but this isn't about you.

01:01:45.564 --> 01:01:46.532
Wow.

01:01:48.567 --> 01:01:50.102
Is that okay?

01:01:50.135 --> 01:01:52.137
Is that okay?

01:01:52.171 --> 01:01:55.040
Yes, yes, this is okay.

01:01:55.074 --> 01:01:56.575
Okay.

01:01:56.608 --> 01:01:58.410
Hearing you talk about her,
when I couldn't talk

01:01:58.444 --> 01:01:59.978
to her only made me
want that more.

01:02:00.012 --> 01:02:00.846
What's wrong with a bold move

01:02:00.879 --> 01:02:02.481
or two to try
and make it up to her?

01:02:02.514 --> 01:02:05.117
Because it's not real.

01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:08.420
It's flash,
and she's a smart girl,

01:02:08.454 --> 01:02:10.289
and maybe
if she's made her choice,

01:02:10.322 --> 01:02:11.990
maybe that's just meant to be.

01:02:12.024 --> 01:02:14.593
No, I'm not going
to give up again.

01:02:14.627 --> 01:02:16.562
Man, you are work.

01:02:24.002 --> 01:02:24.937
I love it.

01:02:26.105 --> 01:02:27.640
Good.

01:02:27.674 --> 01:02:29.408
Well, I know her.

01:02:29.441 --> 01:02:30.576
She's my friend.

01:02:30.609 --> 01:02:33.178
- Wait, we're not friends?
- No.

01:02:33.212 --> 01:02:34.346
I left it at the door.

01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:36.615
I didn't make it
personal either.

01:02:45.290 --> 01:02:47.593
<i>You left it
at the door too, huh?</i>

01:02:47.627 --> 01:02:49.061
Thank you.

01:02:49.094 --> 01:02:50.596
You're welcome. I didn't know

01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:52.131
- if I had the right...
- It's work.

01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:55.367
- Uh, there's also...
- Card,

01:02:55.401 --> 01:02:57.469
a gift and a card?

01:02:57.503 --> 01:02:58.604
Both of those.

01:03:06.345 --> 01:03:07.312
Congratulations.

01:03:10.382 --> 01:03:11.283
Thank you.

01:03:18.157 --> 01:03:19.057
Welcome.

01:03:23.028 --> 01:03:24.263
I can't move my arms.

01:03:25.197 --> 01:03:26.098
Good.

01:03:33.673 --> 01:03:34.641
Um...

01:03:36.108 --> 01:03:37.075
where's my pin?

01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:39.011
Uh, oh.

01:03:42.147 --> 01:03:43.081
Thank you.

01:03:50.155 --> 01:03:51.523
How's that?

01:03:51.557 --> 01:03:52.524
It's pretty good.

01:03:53.492 --> 01:03:54.526
Pretty good?

01:03:56.128 --> 01:03:57.029
It's pretty.

01:03:58.597 --> 01:03:59.531
Oh.

01:03:59.565 --> 01:04:01.266
Oh?

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:02.968
Ah, yes.

01:04:03.803 --> 01:04:05.103
Thank you, sir.

01:04:07.039 --> 01:04:08.708
Be careful next week.

01:04:08.741 --> 01:04:10.209
Okay.

01:04:10.242 --> 01:04:12.277
Drink plenty of water.

01:04:12.311 --> 01:04:14.146
If you're going to be outdoors,
it's going to be hot,

01:04:14.179 --> 01:04:16.615
you're going to be wearing
a dress under again, you know.

01:04:16.649 --> 01:04:18.685
This is day one stuff, Esme.

01:04:18.718 --> 01:04:20.152
Yes, sir.

01:04:20.185 --> 01:04:21.721
When I graduated,
I decided I wasn't

01:04:21.754 --> 01:04:23.522
going to be an idiot
who wore cargo shorts

01:04:23.555 --> 01:04:25.357
and a T-shirt under their gown.

01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:27.292
This was a serious occasion,
so I was going to be

01:04:27.326 --> 01:04:30.062
serious,
so I wore an Oxford shirt,

01:04:30.095 --> 01:04:32.732
tweed pants
and a tie under my gown,

01:04:32.765 --> 01:04:36.736
in 90 degree heat,
whilst hungover.

01:04:36.769 --> 01:04:39.571
- I bet you look good in a tie.
- It depends on the tie...

01:04:39.605 --> 01:04:40.640
I'm going to murder you.

01:04:40.673 --> 01:04:43.175
Fine, I look good in a tie.

01:04:45.177 --> 01:04:47.145
So, what happened?
You stroke out?

01:04:47.179 --> 01:04:50.215
No, I did try heave
walking under the bleachers

01:04:50.249 --> 01:04:51.751
while holding my diploma,
however.

01:04:51.784 --> 01:04:53.619
You didn't drink enough water.

01:04:53.653 --> 01:04:55.387
But I'm an adult now.

01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:57.322
How was President Truman's
speech?

01:05:04.096 --> 01:05:07.065
Wisdom imparted, thank you.

01:05:08.166 --> 01:05:11.336
I told you, you don't
need to worry about me.

01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:12.772
You did.

01:05:12.805 --> 01:05:15.642
I'm a big girl,
and I'll stop coming here.

01:05:15.675 --> 01:05:17.376
That's what
I thought was going to happen.

01:05:17.409 --> 01:05:19.311
- However.
- However what?

01:05:19.344 --> 01:05:21.580
Don't you think
she has the right to know?

01:05:21.613 --> 01:05:24.784
No, no, I don't,
it's none of her business.

01:05:24.817 --> 01:05:27.386
Okay, then, onto you.

01:05:27.419 --> 01:05:28.353
What's next?

01:05:29.889 --> 01:05:31.156
Talk to Ana.

01:05:31.189 --> 01:05:32.457
She's my council.

01:05:33.525 --> 01:05:35.193
Fine.

01:05:35.227 --> 01:05:36.261
Ana.

01:05:37.797 --> 01:05:42.869
Um, well,
tonight is the pre-graduation

01:05:42.902 --> 01:05:46.806
party at the Embarcadero,
in the city.

01:05:46.839 --> 01:05:50.142
Sunday, we graduate,

01:05:50.175 --> 01:05:54.379
and next week is the beach,
for some of us.

01:05:55.748 --> 01:05:59.351
See, Dad, we have a plan.

01:05:59.384 --> 01:06:02.220
How about more
of a long term plan?

01:06:02.254 --> 01:06:04.857
We haven't ordered entrees yet,

01:06:04.891 --> 01:06:08.193
so it's a little early
for the long term plan question.

01:06:08.226 --> 01:06:10.262
You need to start
living in the moment, Dad.

01:06:10.295 --> 01:06:11.363
How would you...

01:06:13.332 --> 01:06:14.767
Probably true.

01:06:14.801 --> 01:06:17.737
Trust me, I'll figure it out.

01:06:17.770 --> 01:06:19.504
You don't think
that she would want to know

01:06:19.538 --> 01:06:21.573
just how committed
you are to getting

01:06:21.607 --> 01:06:23.876
in front of her again, to,
to reconnecting.

01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:26.144
- Come on.
- Or would that just wreck everything

01:06:26.178 --> 01:06:27.346
before it even started?

01:06:27.379 --> 01:06:28.614
Yeah, it would.

01:06:29.514 --> 01:06:31.483
Is that what you want?

01:06:31.516 --> 01:06:32.417
Maybe.

01:06:33.418 --> 01:06:35.621
- Maybe not.
- Jesus.

01:06:35.655 --> 01:06:37.522
Okay, please, don't.

01:06:37.556 --> 01:06:38.624
Why?

01:06:38.658 --> 01:06:39.626
She's a big girl.

01:06:39.659 --> 01:06:40.627
Ana.

01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:41.560
Greg.

01:06:42.829 --> 01:06:44.162
She's a big girl.

01:06:44.196 --> 01:06:45.898
What do you mean?

01:06:45.932 --> 01:06:51.303
I mean it's like you said...
she's not a kid anymore.

01:06:51.336 --> 01:06:53.740
I know she's not a kid anymore,
what do you mean?

01:07:00.412 --> 01:07:04.383
Who do you think got me
into this line of work?

01:07:07.519 --> 01:07:08.655
What?

01:07:08.688 --> 01:07:11.289
I mean, it beats working,

01:07:14.326 --> 01:07:17.329
and she's never been
one for working.

01:07:17.362 --> 01:07:19.832
I mean, you gave her
some work ethic but...

01:07:43.522 --> 01:07:45.257
- I think you need to go.
- I'm going to go

01:07:45.290 --> 01:07:48.560
- whenever I feel...
- Just... just go.

01:07:50.663 --> 01:07:51.596
Please.

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:54.934
Okay.

01:07:54.967 --> 01:07:56.468
I'm sorry.

01:07:56.501 --> 01:07:57.637
What are you sorry for?

01:08:02.507 --> 01:08:03.710
Take care of yourself.

01:08:05.745 --> 01:08:07.446
You too.

01:08:10.282 --> 01:08:10.983
Who's that?

01:08:11.884 --> 01:08:13.686
We have been yelling.

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:16.254
Yeah, but we're not yelling
now though, Greg,

01:08:16.287 --> 01:08:17.555
we're just talking.

01:08:20.792 --> 01:08:21.928
Ana, wait.

01:08:30.469 --> 01:08:32.337
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:08:33.505 --> 01:08:36.374
- Wait, do I have the wrong?
- Are you looking for Greg?

01:08:37.676 --> 01:08:38.845
Is he here?

01:08:38.877 --> 01:08:40.345
Is he here?

01:08:41.313 --> 01:08:43.049
- I'm Zoe.
- Zoe, huh?

01:08:43.082 --> 01:08:45.617
Yeah, I'm like a little late.

01:08:46.953 --> 01:08:48.520
Few minutes late.

01:08:48.553 --> 01:08:49.956
It's well
within the margin of error.

01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:54.559
Oh, okay.

01:08:54.593 --> 01:08:55.493
Thank you.

01:08:56.495 --> 01:08:58.563
- Are you...
- Greg?

01:08:58.596 --> 01:08:59.497
Yes.

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:02.533
That is Greg.

01:09:02.567 --> 01:09:05.772
That is Greg.

01:09:06.706 --> 01:09:08.406
Nice to meet you.

01:09:08.439 --> 01:09:10.609
I'm late, I, I guess.

01:09:10.643 --> 01:09:11.676
Should I come back?

01:09:11.711 --> 01:09:13.845
No, no, no, Zoe, it's okay.

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:14.913
I was just leaving.

01:09:16.413 --> 01:09:17.381
Wasn't I, Greg?

01:09:18.885 --> 01:09:21.453
- Yes.
- Ah,

01:09:21.486 --> 01:09:22.721
before I forget.

01:09:25.490 --> 01:09:26.390
Ana.

01:09:27.794 --> 01:09:30.162
That is not my name.

01:09:34.033 --> 01:09:34.801
Have fun.

01:09:35.968 --> 01:09:37.737
- I will.
- Be careful,

01:09:39.437 --> 01:09:40.471
but have fun.

01:09:40.505 --> 01:09:41.406
Thank you.

01:09:44.676 --> 01:09:45.645
See you.

01:09:50.615 --> 01:09:51.984
I'm sorry, did I?

01:09:52.018 --> 01:09:54.854
No, no, it's my fault,
I'm sorry.

01:09:54.887 --> 01:09:56.022
I'm sorry that I'm late.

01:09:56.055 --> 01:09:57.355
No, no.

01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:59.759
It's okay.

01:09:59.792 --> 01:10:02.128
Well, it's nice
to see you again, Greg.

01:10:02.161 --> 01:10:03.796
Uh, yes.

01:10:04.764 --> 01:10:09.035
And... is this for me?

01:10:12.805 --> 01:10:13.940
Ana, what are you plans?

01:10:15.641 --> 01:10:18.510
Uh, you know.

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:23.082
No doubt
you'll figure it out too.

01:10:23.115 --> 01:10:24.984
She's already got it
figured out.

01:10:25.017 --> 01:10:26.518
She has a plan, huh?

01:10:26.551 --> 01:10:28.453
Maybe she'll let you
take curb notes?

01:10:29.487 --> 01:10:31.157
Are we ready or do we...

01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:33.693
- Sure, she has a plan.
- Greg.

01:10:33.726 --> 01:10:35.527
I'm sorry,
should it be your plan?

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:37.730
Well, in lieu of a better plan...

01:10:37.763 --> 01:10:40.599
No, no, no, I am going
to figure out my own plan.

01:10:40.633 --> 01:10:42.802
I am going
to come up with a plan

01:10:42.835 --> 01:10:44.837
that will revolutionize plans.

01:10:44.871 --> 01:10:47.006
A plan that can stop on a dime,

01:10:47.039 --> 01:10:48.641
and change direction, okay?

01:10:48.674 --> 01:10:51.443
A plan that has range.

01:10:51.476 --> 01:10:52.879
Range?

01:10:52.912 --> 01:10:54.546
Sounds more like a plan created

01:10:54.579 --> 01:10:56.581
by someone who's erratic.

01:10:56.615 --> 01:10:57.783
Erratic?

01:10:59.218 --> 01:11:00.452
What does that mean?

01:11:01.888 --> 01:11:06.158
Erratic, unsteady, erratic.

01:11:06.192 --> 01:11:07.693
What do you mean erratic?

01:11:07.727 --> 01:11:08.694
Altered.

01:11:10.562 --> 01:11:11.864
Altered? I,

01:11:11.898 --> 01:11:13.633
I don't even know
what that means.

01:11:13.666 --> 01:11:15.433
You don't know
what altered means?

01:11:15.467 --> 01:11:17.069
What's altered?

01:11:17.103 --> 01:11:19.939
Does anyone here know
what altered means?

01:11:19.972 --> 01:11:22.440
Gabriel, do you, do you
think that Shannon's altered?

01:11:22.474 --> 01:11:24.476
Stacy, please don't make
Shannon's boyfriend

01:11:24.509 --> 01:11:27.647
of four,
no five months narc on her.

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:29.849
Narc? What, drugs?

01:11:29.882 --> 01:11:31.449
- Boom.
- No,

01:11:31.483 --> 01:11:33.686
- Shannon does not use drugs.
- Drugs?

01:11:33.719 --> 01:11:36.122
Drugs, you seem altered.

01:11:36.155 --> 01:11:37.622
How would you know?

01:11:37.657 --> 01:11:39.491
Altered, what,
what do you mean?

01:11:39.524 --> 01:11:41.093
Not as a new experience.

01:11:41.127 --> 01:11:42.862
Excuse me,
I have to go to the restroom.

01:11:42.895 --> 01:11:44.030
No, you don't.

01:11:44.997 --> 01:11:46.799
I don't, okay.

01:11:46.832 --> 01:11:49.601
No, Ellery, I think that you
and Gabriel should go to...

01:11:49.635 --> 01:11:51.837
What,
go to the bathroom together?

01:11:51.871 --> 01:11:54.240
- That's weird.
- Yes, it is weird,

01:11:54.273 --> 01:11:56.108
going to the bathroom in pairs,

01:11:56.142 --> 01:11:58.244
it is, it's weird.

01:11:58.277 --> 01:12:00.112
Not that men bailing when things

01:12:00.146 --> 01:12:01.914
get tough is anything new to me.

01:12:03.115 --> 01:12:05.583
Would have thought you'd be
the first to flee though, Dad.

01:12:05.617 --> 01:12:07.720
I think the smart money
would have been on Ellery.

01:12:07.753 --> 01:12:09.655
Hey.

01:12:16.195 --> 01:12:18.698
- Sorry, Ellery.
- What for?

01:12:18.731 --> 01:12:21.100
Are you going to insult
all my friends, Dad?

01:12:21.133 --> 01:12:22.868
You're not on something
right now, Shannon?

01:12:22.902 --> 01:12:26.672
No, Dad, I'm not on something.

01:12:26.706 --> 01:12:27.807
I would like another mojito.

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.041
Shannon.

01:12:30.943 --> 01:12:31.844
Ask Ana.

01:12:33.112 --> 01:12:34.880
Ask her what?

01:12:34.914 --> 01:12:36.716
Ask her if I'm altered.

01:12:36.749 --> 01:12:39.085
I mean if you're so fixated
on the question, you know,

01:12:39.118 --> 01:12:40.618
if you don't believe me,

01:12:40.653 --> 01:12:44.190
if you don't trust me, ask her.

01:12:44.223 --> 01:12:45.124
Shannon.

01:12:46.726 --> 01:12:48.094
Go ahead.

01:12:48.127 --> 01:12:49.829
Ask her.

01:12:49.862 --> 01:12:50.930
Ask my friend.

01:12:50.963 --> 01:12:52.530
Stop it.

01:12:52.564 --> 01:12:53.498
Ana?

01:12:55.234 --> 01:12:57.103
You're asking me?

01:12:59.138 --> 01:13:00.740
You are asking me.

01:13:02.675 --> 01:13:03.676
Well...

01:13:07.713 --> 01:13:13.052
she is just upset, which makes

01:13:13.085 --> 01:13:15.287
a good deal of sense
to me right now.

01:13:15.321 --> 01:13:16.255
Thank you, Ana.

01:13:18.190 --> 01:13:20.893
Oh, now you don't
believe my best friend.

01:13:20.926 --> 01:13:22.294
I believe your best friend.

01:13:22.328 --> 01:13:25.031
No, no, you don't.

01:13:25.064 --> 01:13:26.065
Why would you?

01:13:27.599 --> 01:13:31.070
You don't know her,
just like you don't know me.

01:13:31.103 --> 01:13:33.806
I would like to get to know you.

01:13:33.839 --> 01:13:34.840
Well, not tonight.

01:13:37.276 --> 01:13:38.576
And you know what?

01:13:41.313 --> 01:13:42.648
Not Sunday either.

01:13:42.681 --> 01:13:44.116
What do you mean not Sunday?

01:13:45.851 --> 01:13:47.653
Means I don't want you
coming on Sunday.

01:13:48.888 --> 01:13:50.555
I don't want you
to watch me graduate.

01:13:51.690 --> 01:13:53.626
You have not seen me for years,

01:13:53.659 --> 01:13:55.227
you don't get to see me now.

01:13:55.261 --> 01:13:56.561
Shannon.

01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:59.298
Please, sit down.

01:14:00.399 --> 01:14:02.234
No, I'm not going to sit down,

01:14:02.268 --> 01:14:04.737
and I'm not going
to let him ruin my weekend.

01:14:04.770 --> 01:14:06.138
You're doing that
all by yourself.

01:14:06.172 --> 01:14:07.640
Well, then I'll do it myself,

01:14:07.673 --> 01:14:09.275
and I can do it alone,
if you want.

01:14:09.308 --> 01:14:11.377
You know what, Shannon?
That's fine.

01:14:11.410 --> 01:14:13.611
- It's fine?
- Yeah, that's fine.

01:14:13.646 --> 01:14:16.048
If you don't want me to come
Sunday, I won't come Sunday.

01:14:16.082 --> 01:14:18.184
If you want to do it alone,
then do it alone,

01:14:18.217 --> 01:14:19.952
- see how that works for you.
- I will!

01:14:19.985 --> 01:14:22.755
- Greg.
- No, Stacy, no.

01:14:23.856 --> 01:14:26.092
You don't want me to come
Sunday, I won't come Sunday.

01:14:27.793 --> 01:14:30.196
You know what?
As of this moment,

01:14:31.897 --> 01:14:33.365
I've stopped giving a shit.

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:35.301
Happy?

01:14:38.404 --> 01:14:40.072
Shannon, where are you going?

01:14:40.106 --> 01:14:42.641
I don't have to sit here
for this, do I?

01:14:42.675 --> 01:14:45.144
No, you don't have to leave,
I'll leave.

01:14:45.177 --> 01:14:47.746
No, I'm leaving.

01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:49.081
You already left.

01:14:49.115 --> 01:14:50.649
Okay,
how do you expect to get home?

01:14:50.683 --> 01:14:51.984
Not with me driving, you're not.

01:14:52.017 --> 01:14:54.153
That's fine! I'll just...

01:14:54.186 --> 01:14:55.688
Why don't you go home with this?

01:14:59.925 --> 01:15:00.960
What is this?

01:15:01.894 --> 01:15:03.662
It's your graduation gift.

01:15:03.696 --> 01:15:05.331
Why don't you try
going home with that?

01:15:06.265 --> 01:15:08.100
What are you talking about?

01:15:08.134 --> 01:15:09.068
Sweetie, come on.

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:42.868
Nice.

01:15:52.077 --> 01:15:53.078
This is for me?

01:15:54.813 --> 01:15:55.848
I don't know.

01:15:56.949 --> 01:15:58.884
You were about to leave.

01:15:58.918 --> 01:16:00.152
I was about to leave.

01:16:01.453 --> 01:16:03.289
I was about to stop
giving a shit.

01:16:07.193 --> 01:16:08.861
What am I supposed to say?

01:16:09.828 --> 01:16:11.397
How about saying you're sorry,

01:16:13.232 --> 01:16:16.035
sitting down,
and saying thank you,

01:16:16.068 --> 01:16:17.203
the way I raised you.

01:16:26.979 --> 01:16:27.913
Greg.

01:16:30.216 --> 01:16:31.116
What?

01:16:33.052 --> 01:16:34.019
Sit down.

01:16:38.557 --> 01:16:41.794
Okay... so,
I think we can order

01:16:41.827 --> 01:16:44.863
some food now, little zucchini,
calamari, right?

01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:48.934
I'm sorry.

01:16:53.305 --> 01:16:54.273
Okay.

01:16:56.809 --> 01:16:58.277
I don't want to fight anymore.

01:16:59.578 --> 01:17:00.879
I don't either.

01:17:02.114 --> 01:17:03.983
So, do we think
we're ready or do we...

01:17:04.016 --> 01:17:05.951
- Yes, we're ready.
- We are ready.

01:17:05.985 --> 01:17:09.521
I'm going to need a second, um.

01:17:09.555 --> 01:17:12.424
I'll have a filet,
rare, with asparagus

01:17:12.458 --> 01:17:15.861
and a baked potato,
and another glass of this,

01:17:15.894 --> 01:17:18.897
and I'll be back in a second.

01:17:18.931 --> 01:17:20.432
Very good, sir.

01:17:20.466 --> 01:17:21.467
We'll be waiting.

01:17:31.243 --> 01:17:33.145
Vodka, rocks, please.

01:17:33.178 --> 01:17:34.280
Absolutely.

01:17:36.515 --> 01:17:38.083
How's your night going so far?

01:17:40.619 --> 01:17:42.955
I am optimistic.

01:17:42.988 --> 01:17:44.957
Celebrating, a graduate?

01:17:45.991 --> 01:17:47.359
A commencement, yes.

01:17:49.094 --> 01:17:51.030
Everything okay back there?

01:17:51.063 --> 01:17:53.098
Seems to be settling down, sir.

01:17:54.133 --> 01:17:55.200
Okay, thanks.

01:18:05.611 --> 01:18:07.313
Suppose I'm ready
for another one.

01:18:34.298 --> 01:18:35.424
Hi, Grandma.

01:18:37.134 --> 01:18:39.595
The buses are running
later and later each day.

01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:42.472
Yes, I know.

01:18:43.765 --> 01:18:45.142
The leftovers from yesterday,

01:18:45.726 --> 01:18:48.979
did you eat them all
or did you save me some?

01:18:49.062 --> 01:18:50.647
Of course I saved some.

01:18:52.524 --> 01:18:54.818
You always cook too much.

01:18:55.277 --> 01:19:01.700
Because I always think about you
having food when you get home from work.

01:19:01.742 --> 01:19:04.077
You always think of everything.

01:19:17.583 --> 01:19:21.387
So,
that actually turned out okay.

01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:22.921
Turned out, yeah.

01:19:24.056 --> 01:19:25.190
Your dad's pretty cool.

01:19:27.059 --> 01:19:27.926
Yeah, I guess.

01:19:31.330 --> 01:19:35.100
You know, I was expecting a lot,
lot worse.

01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:38.971
Weren't you, Ana?

01:19:41.106 --> 01:19:42.508
I didn't know what to expect.

01:19:43.710 --> 01:19:44.677
I guess.

01:19:47.346 --> 01:19:49.481
I mean,
I just don't know him that well.

01:19:51.316 --> 01:19:52.918
This car's nice.

01:19:54.553 --> 01:19:55.521
Well,

01:19:56.723 --> 01:19:58.590
sounds like he's trying
to change that.

01:19:58.624 --> 01:19:59.659
Yeah.

01:20:02.127 --> 01:20:04.664
That's good, right?

01:20:04.697 --> 01:20:06.398
That could be good.

01:20:08.668 --> 01:20:09.968
He's not that bad.

01:20:12.104 --> 01:20:15.407
Guess I'm glad he was there.

01:20:15.441 --> 01:20:16.643
Sure, yeah, I mean,

01:20:17.744 --> 01:20:20.179
I guess that's the way
it's supposed to be, right?

01:20:20.212 --> 01:20:21.079
Right.

01:20:24.082 --> 01:20:24.983
Right, Ana?

01:20:27.019 --> 01:20:27.720
Of course.

01:20:30.088 --> 01:20:32.191
Right, so when
are we leaving tonight?

01:20:32.224 --> 01:20:34.426
Oh, I have to go
into the lab tonight.

01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:36.061
What?

01:20:36.094 --> 01:20:38.096
It's like 11 o'clock.

01:20:38.130 --> 01:20:39.364
What about Ellery?

01:20:39.398 --> 01:20:41.768
Fuck that boy clown.

01:20:41.801 --> 01:20:45.270
I'm going
to text him and tell him

01:20:45.304 --> 01:20:46.371
you're not going out.

01:20:48.106 --> 01:20:49.608
Always stealing away.

01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:16.877
What's wrong? You don't like it?
Is it cold?

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:18.128
Just give me a minute.

01:21:28.722 --> 01:21:30.933
Sorry, do you have a lot of work to do?

01:21:32.142 --> 01:21:34.811
No worries, Grandma,
I will finish outside.

01:21:36.939 --> 01:21:39.066
Okay, but don't go very far.

01:21:39.816 --> 01:21:42.486
Don't worry, Grandma,
where am I supposed to go?

01:22:05.752 --> 01:22:07.386
Hey.

01:22:07.419 --> 01:22:08.420
Hello!

01:22:09.421 --> 01:22:11.123
Hello,
can you give a little help?

01:22:11.156 --> 01:22:13.058
- What?
- Come here a second.

01:22:16.361 --> 01:22:18.096
That's right, don't be rude.

01:22:18.130 --> 01:22:19.298
Hey, you're the one being rude.

01:22:19.331 --> 01:22:20.399
Relax.

01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:22.835
You're right, you're right.

01:22:22.869 --> 01:22:24.303
My fault.

01:22:24.336 --> 01:22:26.204
You know where the Oro del...

01:22:26.238 --> 01:22:27.807
Sorry, sweetie,
do you know where

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:30.275
the Oro del Desierto Hotel is?

01:22:31.577 --> 01:22:36.281
Uh, yeah, I think it's, if you
go down the 880, um, I think...

01:22:36.315 --> 01:22:37.750
You're right, you're right.

01:22:37.784 --> 01:22:40.252
Yeah, 880 South,
it's the first or second exist,

01:22:40.285 --> 01:22:42.789
you'll see the sign
from the freeway.

01:22:42.822 --> 01:22:44.256
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

01:22:44.289 --> 01:22:45.223
You're welcome.

01:22:46.191 --> 01:22:47.092
Hey.

01:22:49.261 --> 01:22:50.262
How old are you?

01:22:54.667 --> 01:22:55.735
You're beautiful.

01:22:57.937 --> 01:22:59.605
- Thank you.
- Want to make some money?

01:22:59.639 --> 01:23:01.607
Hey, shut up.

01:23:01.641 --> 01:23:02.709
You're right.

01:23:05.945 --> 01:23:09.147
He's not wrong though.

01:23:10.817 --> 01:23:11.851
You busy?

01:23:14.586 --> 01:23:15.822
You busy right now?

01:23:19.224 --> 01:23:20.425
Come with us.

01:23:21.761 --> 01:23:23.362
You can make a lot of money.

01:23:28.635 --> 01:23:31.436
You can get
on the 880 from over there.

01:23:35.708 --> 01:23:36.743
Thanks.

01:23:37.710 --> 01:23:38.645
You're welcome.

01:23:51.958 --> 01:23:54.661
There's a pre-game,
and a lounge in the mission.

01:23:57.496 --> 01:24:00.532
We could tool up
the 101 in my new sports car.

01:24:03.770 --> 01:24:05.470
You think you could just get out

01:24:05.504 --> 01:24:07.506
of the lab and join us, Ana?

01:24:08.775 --> 01:24:09.709
Maybe could?

01:24:11.610 --> 01:24:12.511
We'll see.
