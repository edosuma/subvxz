00:16.146 --> 00:18.540
[siren wailing]

00:28.637 --> 00:29.812
[radio chatter]

00:35.513 --> 00:37.559
[male #1]
'Thank God,
you're here.'

00:37.646 --> 00:38.995
There was screaming

00:39.082 --> 00:44.392
and gunshots
upstairs in room 222.

00:44.479 --> 00:46.524
The one--
the one on the right.

00:46.611 --> 00:48.091
'Right there.'

00:52.574 --> 00:54.358
Police! Open the door.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.756
'Come on, open up!'

01:11.288 --> 01:12.420
[gasps]

01:26.086 --> 01:28.479
[indistinct radio chatter]

01:38.924 --> 01:43.059
Glad you could make it.
We have a young female--

01:43.146 --> 01:45.627
Patrice Matigan
and Joseph Purcell

01:45.714 --> 01:47.237
who was gonna
be the star witness

01:47.324 --> 01:49.631
in California vs. Carris,
which wasone

01:49.718 --> 01:51.328
of the attorney general's

01:51.415 --> 01:53.809
favorite upcoming
narcotics cases.

01:55.985 --> 01:58.030
State's witness,
and no police protection?

01:58.118 --> 01:59.728
Uh-huh. Davis PD.
Had it covered--

01:59.815 --> 02:02.861
That is, until Purcell
went AWOL. A few weeks ago.

02:02.948 --> 02:05.168
Didn't want to testify,
I guess.

02:05.255 --> 02:08.215
With Purcell dead, the case
against Carris dies, too.

02:08.302 --> 02:12.741
He walks. So obviously, guys,
for all of our sakes,

02:12.828 --> 02:14.264
this is a must-close.

02:16.571 --> 02:18.529
[Virgil]
'Davis PD is still running
the Carris case, by the way'

02:18.616 --> 02:21.271
so we have to work with them.
Don't freeze 'em out.

02:21.358 --> 02:23.708
Who is Carris, and where is
he or she right now?

02:23.795 --> 02:26.407
Rick Carris is the man to know
in the Davis meth business.

02:26.494 --> 02:31.238
'He was busted a month ago after
a big, expensive operation.'

02:31.325 --> 02:34.328
'He's out and about
on a $2 million bond.'

02:34.415 --> 02:37.069
'Purcell here is one
of his top street captains.'

02:39.376 --> 02:40.812
[chuckles]

02:40.899 --> 02:42.901
Look at that.

02:42.988 --> 02:44.512
This fool is state's witness

02:44.599 --> 02:46.296
against the biggest
cocaine dealer in the county

02:46.383 --> 02:49.038
and he's dealing the same drug
out of his own motel room.

02:49.125 --> 02:50.822
Like Carris wouldn't
hear about that.

02:50.909 --> 02:52.998
'He must have had
a death wish.'

02:54.391 --> 02:56.741
[Teresa]
'Looks like a couple of ounces.'

02:56.828 --> 02:58.221
It's not cocaine.

03:00.092 --> 03:01.920
It's powdered milk.

03:02.007 --> 03:04.401
Yes, that's often used
to cut the product.

03:04.488 --> 03:05.620
Jane?

03:09.232 --> 03:10.364
[alarm beeps]

03:14.498 --> 03:15.847
what are you looking for?

03:15.934 --> 03:17.458
The girl had her keys
in her hand.

03:17.545 --> 03:19.677
She was only planning
on stopping by.

03:30.253 --> 03:31.385
[baby cooing]

03:33.909 --> 03:35.563
Oh, no.

03:35.650 --> 03:39.654
- Hello.
- 'A baby. Hello.'

03:43.310 --> 03:46.226
[theme music]

03:53.450 --> 03:55.278
So what happens to her?

03:55.365 --> 03:58.368
Social services have foster
moms that specialize in babies.

03:58.455 --> 04:01.023
They'll take care of her until
we can find Patrice's family.

04:01.110 --> 04:02.894
- If she has a family.
- Yeah.

04:02.981 --> 04:05.027
[female #1]
'Social services.
I'm here for Kaylee?'

04:05.114 --> 04:06.246
Hi.

04:09.771 --> 04:10.946
Bye.

04:12.904 --> 04:14.950
Ooh-whee!

04:15.037 --> 04:17.996
Lisbon, Jane, Van Pelt

04:18.083 --> 04:22.305
Detectives Blakely
and Preciado, Davis Homicide.

04:22.392 --> 04:25.308
They will be your liaisons
with Davis PD.

04:25.395 --> 04:26.570
'I speak for myself
and your chief'

04:26.657 --> 04:30.008
when I urge you all
to work harmoniously.

04:30.095 --> 04:31.358
'That means play nice.'

04:32.141 --> 04:33.882
Keep me posted.

04:33.969 --> 04:37.538
- Hi. So your name's Blakely?
- Mm-hmm.

04:37.625 --> 04:39.366
The first responder
was a Blakely.

04:39.453 --> 04:40.889
That was my son.

04:40.976 --> 04:43.152
Poor kid, first time
rolling up on a body.

04:43.239 --> 04:44.545
Puked his guts up later.

04:44.632 --> 04:48.418
He'll be okay. Listen, uh,
just so we're clear

04:48.505 --> 04:51.029
now you can call us
liaisons if you like

04:51.116 --> 04:54.076
but this is still
a Davis PD case.

04:54.163 --> 04:57.340
Our narcotics unit's been trying
to bust Rick Carris for years.

04:57.427 --> 04:59.734
We appreciate your position.

04:59.821 --> 05:01.431
Have you checked
the liquor store over there

05:01.518 --> 05:02.911
for surveillance cameras?

05:02.998 --> 05:04.826
Not yet. We're still
questioning the guest.

05:04.913 --> 05:06.915
- I'll get on it.
- 'I got a dumb question.'

05:07.002 --> 05:09.178
How come you guys let
Joe Purcell slip away?

05:09.265 --> 05:10.919
Stuff happens, right?

05:11.006 --> 05:12.747
Yeah. Stuff happens.

05:12.834 --> 05:15.576
Yeah. When we bring in Rick
we'll give you a call.

05:15.663 --> 05:18.187
You're confident
it was Carris who did this?

05:18.274 --> 05:19.754
Purcell seems like
the type of man

05:19.841 --> 05:21.321
who had quite a few enemies.

05:21.408 --> 05:24.019
Yeah, we're confident.

05:24.106 --> 05:25.281
What if Purcell
wasn't the target?

05:25.368 --> 05:26.717
What if the girl
was the target?

05:26.804 --> 05:27.979
What makes you think that?

05:28.066 --> 05:29.851
What makes you think
she wasn't?

05:29.938 --> 05:32.157
Either way, she's the place to
start with the investigation.

05:32.244 --> 05:33.811
As she was only here
for a moment

05:33.898 --> 05:36.379
'so the shooter came in
as soon as she arrived'

05:36.466 --> 05:39.339
which suggests that he
or they followed her here.

05:39.426 --> 05:41.210
So we'll retrace her steps.

05:41.297 --> 05:43.517
What's Patrice Matigan's
current address?

05:43.604 --> 05:46.563
We don't know. We checked
the address on her license

05:46.650 --> 05:49.087
and registration, but she hasn't
lived her for several months.

05:49.174 --> 05:51.351
You're making this more
difficult than it needs to be.

05:51.438 --> 05:54.136
We know who done it. This was
a hit ordered by Rick Carris.

05:54.223 --> 05:55.833
If he's in town,
we'll round him up.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.792
You guys relax,
see the sights.

05:57.879 --> 06:00.098
We'll call you
when there's any news.

06:02.231 --> 06:04.929
When are you gonna learn
to cool it without being told?

06:05.016 --> 06:07.802
Oh, come on. They pissed you
off, too, the sexist pigs.

06:07.889 --> 06:10.065
They were.

06:10.152 --> 06:11.545
I just said they were.

06:11.632 --> 06:13.982
You were
saying it ironically.

06:14.069 --> 06:18.029
Here. There was a couple of
issues of that in her car.

06:18.116 --> 06:21.816
"Fifty fresh and floral ideas
for a spring wedding?"

06:21.903 --> 06:24.862
'Why on earth would
Patrice Matigan have this?'

06:24.949 --> 06:26.386
Mailing address.

06:26.473 --> 06:30.999
"Lacey Wells.
65758 Rancho Highway."

06:31.086 --> 06:32.261
Let's go.

06:35.569 --> 06:36.700
[dog barking]

06:39.660 --> 06:42.184
Lacey Wells?

06:42.271 --> 06:43.794
You the cops?

06:43.881 --> 06:45.970
[Teresa]
'Yeah, CBI.'

06:46.057 --> 06:47.015
What's the problem?

06:47.102 --> 06:49.409
Do you know Patrice Matigan?

06:49.496 --> 06:51.541
She lives here.

06:51.628 --> 06:53.848
What about her?
And where is she?

06:53.935 --> 06:55.937
She was murdered
early this morning.

06:57.329 --> 06:59.157
Oh, my God.

07:01.812 --> 07:04.598
How long have you
known Patrice?

07:04.685 --> 07:07.557
Couple of years,
like that.

07:07.644 --> 07:09.820
And she's lived here
with you for how long?

07:09.907 --> 07:11.735
Since Joe got busted.

07:11.822 --> 07:13.737
Two, three months.

07:13.824 --> 07:15.609
She couldn't stay with him,
the way he lives.

07:15.696 --> 07:18.655
That son of a bitch!

07:18.742 --> 07:21.092
'Now I knew he'd get her
into trouble.'

07:21.179 --> 07:23.791
Can you think of anybody who
would have wanted to kill him?

07:23.878 --> 07:27.011
Aside from Rick Carris
and any of his crew?

07:27.098 --> 07:28.230
Sure, lots of people.

07:30.101 --> 07:32.060
Can you tell us
what happened last night?

07:32.147 --> 07:35.019
Joe called her really late.

07:35.106 --> 07:38.632
He's mad hungry,
but he's paranoid.

07:38.719 --> 07:39.894
Won't leave his room.

07:39.981 --> 07:42.418
Thinks Rick Carris' boys
are everywhere.

07:42.505 --> 07:48.206
Begs her to bring him some food
which she does like a fool.

07:50.774 --> 07:53.647
And that's..

07:53.734 --> 07:57.738
That's the last I saw
of her and Kaylee.

07:57.825 --> 07:59.783
Why would she take Kaylee
out with her

07:59.870 --> 08:01.350
in the middle of the night?

08:01.437 --> 08:04.571
Couldn't you have
babysat for her?

08:04.658 --> 08:07.356
I had been drinking.

08:07.443 --> 08:10.533
And she didn't want
to leave Kaylee with me.

08:10.620 --> 08:14.450
She had her flaws,
but she was a good mom.

08:14.537 --> 08:17.801
I mean, that kid
is always clean

08:17.888 --> 08:19.673
and-and dry,
and she's smiling.

08:21.762 --> 08:23.720
I mean.. Look at how
she keeps this place.

08:23.807 --> 08:26.984
Yeah. It's nice.
How does she pay the rent?

08:27.071 --> 08:29.683
Oh, she always has money
when she needs it.

08:29.770 --> 08:32.207
You know, her and me got busted
this last Christmas

08:32.294 --> 08:34.731
and she came up with, like,
10 grand to front the bail

08:34.818 --> 08:36.994
and even more for the lawyer.

08:37.081 --> 08:40.389
I mean, we were busted
with a whole ounce of meth

08:40.476 --> 08:41.521
and she made that crap
disappear.

08:41.608 --> 08:42.783
She was into meth?

08:42.870 --> 08:45.655
No. No.

08:45.742 --> 08:48.615
No, it was my drugs.

08:48.702 --> 08:52.880
But it was in her car,
so you know..

08:52.967 --> 08:55.839
Did you ask her how she got
the money to pay for the lawyer?

08:55.926 --> 08:57.667
She wasn't the hooker type

08:57.754 --> 09:01.410
so I just figured she had a rich
boyfriend hidden somewhere.

09:01.497 --> 09:03.281
You know, a couple of times,
a dude would come by

09:03.368 --> 09:06.937
and not come in.
You know, she'd go for a ride

09:07.024 --> 09:10.288
and then she had cash
when she came back.

09:10.375 --> 09:11.812
What did he look like?

09:11.899 --> 09:15.337
He's, um, like a skinny,
tough guy

09:15.424 --> 09:18.732
dark hair
and drove a blue car.

09:18.819 --> 09:21.996
[phone ringing]
Excuse me.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.563
It always goes off.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.042
Lisbon.

09:25.129 --> 09:26.870
Just got a call
from Sacramento homicide.

09:26.957 --> 09:28.959
Snitch gave 'em
a location on Rick Carris.

09:29.046 --> 09:31.309
'He's in Boonville,
halfway between here and Davis.'

09:31.396 --> 09:33.268
Get an entry team.
We're on our way.

09:33.355 --> 09:34.835
Should I tell Blakely
and Preciado?

09:34.922 --> 09:37.141
Of course. Davis PD are
our partners in this.

09:37.228 --> 09:39.404
Hold off on going in
until I get there.

09:42.320 --> 09:43.931
Thank you, Lacey.

09:44.018 --> 09:47.456
Yeah, hey, uh, listen,
social services.. They're..

09:47.543 --> 09:50.154
They're not gonna bring Kaylee
back here, are they?

09:50.241 --> 09:52.156
- No.
- I-I love her and all

09:52.243 --> 09:54.463
But I'm not..
I-I couldn't..

09:54.550 --> 09:57.509
Don't worry. They're not gonna
bring her back here, okay?

09:57.597 --> 09:59.555
She's goes somewhere okay,
though, right?

09:59.642 --> 10:01.383
I mean, they'll..
They'll take care of her good?

10:01.470 --> 10:03.994
Yes. They try.

10:04.081 --> 10:05.909
She's a good kid, so..

10:07.432 --> 10:10.348
[dramatic music]

10:13.700 --> 10:15.440
Hey. Where you going?

10:15.527 --> 10:17.791
To make the bust. What do
you think? Cover the back.

10:17.878 --> 10:19.531
- Wait.
- What?

10:19.619 --> 10:20.924
Oh, you guys wanna help

10:21.011 --> 10:22.622
or you gonna stand there
and pick your nose?

10:22.709 --> 10:24.754
Come on, guys. Play nice.
This is a joint operation.

10:24.841 --> 10:26.408
We go in together when our boss
and the entry team get here.

10:26.495 --> 10:28.279
Uh-uh.
This is ourarrest.

10:28.366 --> 10:31.108
Always has been, and we got
no time to wait for your mommy.

10:31.195 --> 10:33.284
Hey, there's always time,
alright? Let 's do this right.

10:33.371 --> 10:35.069
Go in too quickly,
and someone will get hurt.

10:35.156 --> 10:38.333
This is real police work, sonny.
People get hurt.

10:38.420 --> 10:40.117
Go push some paper.

10:40.204 --> 10:43.730
Real police work? You mean like
protecting a state's witness?

10:43.817 --> 10:45.557
Rigsby, hey, hey.
Walk away. Walk away.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.429
Look at me. Alright?
We told 'em not to go in.

10:47.516 --> 10:49.257
If this goes south now,
it's their necks.

10:49.344 --> 10:52.782
We don't want to be involved
in any way. Be smart. Let it go.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.310
What's going on?
What are they doing?

10:59.397 --> 11:01.443
Blakely and Preciado wouldn't
wait for the entry team.

11:01.530 --> 11:02.444
Tried to talk to them.
They wouldn't listen.

11:02.531 --> 11:04.272
They're out for blood.

11:07.014 --> 11:09.886
[instrumental music]

11:14.848 --> 11:15.979
[gun cocks]

11:24.074 --> 11:26.033
Don't move!
Hands up!

11:26.773 --> 11:27.904
[gunshot]

11:41.396 --> 11:42.614
[grunting]

11:44.921 --> 11:48.620
- Get on your knees right now.
- Let's see your hands.

11:48.708 --> 11:52.146
That's our bust.
Hand him over.

11:52.233 --> 11:55.715
The hell we will.
Walk away.

11:55.802 --> 11:56.933
[Blakely]
'Hey, calm down.'

12:08.075 --> 12:09.206
[groaning]

12:11.208 --> 12:13.254
[Teresa]
Yes, we get it.

12:13.341 --> 12:16.039
'You're very calm
and in control, Rick..'

12:16.126 --> 12:19.608
For a man being questioned in
a double murder investigation.

12:19.695 --> 12:21.392
I didn't do this thing.

12:21.479 --> 12:23.438
Although, I've been sat in this
frickin' chair so many times

12:23.525 --> 12:25.222
this is kind of restful.

12:25.309 --> 12:27.050
That's right, isn't it?
Many times.

12:29.096 --> 12:32.839
"Assault, possession,
intent to distribute."

12:32.926 --> 12:36.494
This trafficking case coming
up, that's three now for you.

12:36.581 --> 12:38.018
'You get nailed,
you're in for life.'

12:38.105 --> 12:39.367
That's a long time.

12:39.454 --> 12:41.151
All on the testimony
of Joe Purcell.

12:41.238 --> 12:42.979
Look, it's no secret
Joe Purcell's death

12:43.066 --> 12:46.809
was a huge boon for me, man.
Come on, it was huge.

12:46.896 --> 12:48.855
I gotta confess, I was..

12:48.942 --> 12:50.682
Really starting to feel
that life sentence

12:50.770 --> 12:53.250
'breathe down my neck,
but you know what?'

12:53.337 --> 12:57.254
I got angels, man. I got
fierce angels on my shoulders.

12:57.341 --> 12:59.387
[Cho]
'Are you a man
of your word, Rick?'

12:59.474 --> 13:02.085
- I am.
- You do what you say you'll do?

13:02.172 --> 13:03.913
Look, I know
where this is going.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.872
This is from Purcell's
answering machine.

13:05.959 --> 13:08.831
[Rick on tape]
Hey, Joe.
You're a dead man. Dead.

13:08.918 --> 13:11.921
I'm gonna do you my own self.
I'm gonna look you in the eye

13:12.008 --> 13:14.097
and cut your heart out and shove
it down your throat, you mo--

13:14.184 --> 13:16.404
That is you, isn't it?

13:16.491 --> 13:18.928
Hyperbole is lost
on some people.

13:19.015 --> 13:20.887
[Cho]
'We think you kept your word,
Rick. You found Patrice.'

13:20.974 --> 13:22.758
You followed her to Joe Purcell
hiding at the motel.

13:22.845 --> 13:26.109
You killed him and that young
girl just to stay out of prison

13:26.196 --> 13:27.981
'just like you said you would.'

13:28.068 --> 13:31.245
No, I said I was gonna cut his
heart out and feed it to him.

13:31.332 --> 13:33.029
Poetic license.

13:33.116 --> 13:35.118
Uh-uh. No, if I had found him,
I'd have kept my word.

13:35.205 --> 13:36.511
Believe me, and I
was looking for him.

13:36.598 --> 13:38.426
That's how you know
it wasn't me, man.

13:38.513 --> 13:39.949
'Alright, maybe I wouldn't have
cut his heart out or nothing'

13:40.036 --> 13:41.385
but I definitely
would have cut him.

13:41.472 --> 13:43.779
I mean, I've got
a reputation to consider.

13:43.866 --> 13:45.302
[Cho]
'Where were you last night?'

13:45.389 --> 13:47.565
- A bar I own, Del's Tavern.
- 'Until when?'

13:49.176 --> 13:50.960
I don't know. 11:30, maybe.

13:51.047 --> 13:52.353
'Anyone with you?'

13:52.440 --> 13:54.877
Oh, yeah. Sasha.

13:54.964 --> 13:58.663
Sasha.
Sasha have a second name?

13:58.750 --> 14:00.752
Sasha the cocktail waitress.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.886
[Cho]
'One young lady in your employ.
That's not much of an alibi.'

14:03.973 --> 14:05.540
It's not much of a case, man.

14:05.627 --> 14:08.369
You got no murder weapon
and you got no witnesses.

14:08.456 --> 14:12.155
So you can kiss my ass, unless
you want to get a sun lamp

14:12.242 --> 14:15.071
in here and a couple of beers.
I'll be happy to kick back

14:15.158 --> 14:17.682
and listen to you guys
waste your frickin' time.

14:17.769 --> 14:20.250
I guess I'll just hand
you over to the Davis PD

14:20.337 --> 14:24.428
They're very anxious
to talk to you.

14:24.515 --> 14:25.995
Alright. Whatever.

14:26.082 --> 14:27.736
Look, I want to talk
to my lawyer now, please.

14:27.823 --> 14:29.825
[Teresa]
'Okay. So we're done here.'

14:33.829 --> 14:35.309
[Jane]
'Food's here.'

14:37.441 --> 14:38.703
Hawaiian?

14:38.790 --> 14:40.009
Yeah.

14:40.096 --> 14:41.706
Cho hates pineapple.

14:41.793 --> 14:43.708
Well, he can take it off,
can't he?

14:43.795 --> 14:45.754
Yeah, I guess.

14:45.841 --> 14:48.104
I don't complain when
he and Rigsby order Mexican.

14:48.191 --> 14:49.671
What is it you don't like
about Mexican?

14:49.758 --> 14:52.369
Cilantro. I can't stand it.

14:52.456 --> 14:53.980
But I don't make a fuss.

14:54.067 --> 14:57.200
Oh, you don't, do you?
Why is that?

14:57.287 --> 15:00.595
Sometimes you have
to go along to get along.

15:00.682 --> 15:02.162
It's nice to be nice

15:02.249 --> 15:03.467
but if you want
to get ahead in life

15:03.554 --> 15:05.382
sometimes you
have to be a bitch.

15:05.469 --> 15:06.470
I know you know how.

15:06.557 --> 15:08.081
Gee, thanks.

15:08.168 --> 15:11.562
It's all about the balance,
grace. Yin yang.

15:11.649 --> 15:13.564
'Nice, bitch.'

15:13.651 --> 15:15.610
A little bit of bitch
inside the nice

15:15.697 --> 15:16.959
a little bit of nice
inside the bitch.

15:17.046 --> 15:18.352
Yeah, I'll work on that.

15:18.439 --> 15:20.180
- Keep 'em guessing.
- 'Uh-huh.'

15:25.185 --> 15:27.274
There's pineapple on it.

15:27.361 --> 15:28.623
You can take it off.

15:28.710 --> 15:32.018
'I'll know it's been there.'

15:32.105 --> 15:33.758
So Carris was
at Del's Tavern.

15:33.845 --> 15:35.717
Sasha the cocktail waitress
says she was with him

15:35.804 --> 15:37.632
at his residence at 12:45 a.m.

15:37.719 --> 15:39.373
'When the motel shootings
took place.'

15:39.460 --> 15:41.027
She's confident
about the time frame

15:41.114 --> 15:43.029
'because they were having sex
with the TV on.'

15:43.116 --> 15:44.117
And it was the Scottish guy
talking to that actress

15:44.204 --> 15:45.770
who married the country singer.

15:45.857 --> 15:47.120
[Wayne]
'Carris would've
got someone else'

15:47.207 --> 15:48.860
to do the dirty work
for him anyway.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.253
He was only boasting
when he said about

15:50.340 --> 15:52.125
how he's gonna rip out
Purcell's heart himself.

15:52.212 --> 15:53.909
He's a drug dealer,
not an Aztec.

15:53.996 --> 15:56.303
That's good. Not an Aztec.

15:56.390 --> 15:58.740
You're right. Carris isn't
responsible for these murders.

15:58.827 --> 16:00.524
- Why not?
- 'He told you himself.'

16:00.611 --> 16:02.918
It's not his style. He wouldn't
have had the patience to watch

16:03.005 --> 16:05.355
and follow Patrice
until she led him to Purcell.

16:05.442 --> 16:07.053
And if he had found her, he
would have just jumped right in

16:07.140 --> 16:09.098
and hurt her
until she gave Purcell up.

16:09.185 --> 16:10.970
Just for the sake of argument,
let's assume you're right.

16:11.057 --> 16:14.147
Yes, I'm saying that maybe
Patrice Matigan was the target.

16:14.234 --> 16:16.149
That's the second time
you said that.

16:16.236 --> 16:18.629
[Patrick]
'Well, Patrice she was an
attractive young woman'

16:18.716 --> 16:20.370
'but didn't work'

16:20.457 --> 16:23.025
And had a regular supply
of money from somewhere.

16:23.112 --> 16:24.287
Boyfriend.

16:24.374 --> 16:25.680
And was able to make

16:25.767 --> 16:27.638
a very serious drug
charge disappear.

16:27.725 --> 16:28.683
Cop boyfriend.

16:28.770 --> 16:30.076
Skinny cop boyfriend

16:30.163 --> 16:31.338
with dark hair
that drives a blue car

16:31.425 --> 16:32.992
if you listen to Lacey Wells.

16:33.079 --> 16:35.255
Detective Preciado is skinny
with dark hair.

16:35.342 --> 16:36.778
He had crossed my mind.

16:36.865 --> 16:39.520
And a hot-tempered man,
as we now know

16:39.607 --> 16:42.131
who probably carries
what, a .38?

16:42.218 --> 16:44.220
- Yeah. Yeah, I think he does.
- Yeah.

16:44.307 --> 16:45.613
Joe and Patrice were shot
with a .38.

16:45.700 --> 16:46.744
Yes, they were.

16:46.831 --> 16:48.485
Slow down. What's his motive?

16:48.572 --> 16:50.052
Well, it's a simple
crime of passion, isn't it?

16:50.139 --> 16:51.706
He comes upon the woman he loves
with another man.

16:51.793 --> 16:53.403
Kills them both. Oh, damn.

16:53.490 --> 16:55.014
He couldn't have been
that surprised.

16:55.101 --> 16:56.363
She had Joe Purcell's baby.

16:56.450 --> 16:58.669
How is she? The baby.

16:58.756 --> 17:01.803
Uh, fine, I guess.
I mean, she's a baby.

17:01.890 --> 17:03.805
Keep 'em warm and fed,
they're happy.

17:03.892 --> 17:05.676
Let's go have
a chat with Preciado.

17:05.763 --> 17:08.984
We're already in hot water
with the Davis PD.

17:09.071 --> 17:11.160
We need to be sure
we're right

17:11.247 --> 17:12.944
'find out the facts
and then act.'

17:13.032 --> 17:14.598
Yes, boss.

17:14.685 --> 17:17.123
Let's see if Patrice really did
dodge a possession charge

17:17.210 --> 17:18.689
'at Christmas
and let's make sure'

17:18.776 --> 17:21.388
'the story about
the accident money is bogus.'

17:21.475 --> 17:22.911
Then we'll go
to the friend, Lacey

17:22.998 --> 17:24.434
and we'll show her pictures.

17:24.521 --> 17:27.350
Ifshe IDs Preciado
as the man she saw

17:27.437 --> 17:31.659
and ifPreciado drives a blue
car and ifhe carries a .38

17:31.746 --> 17:34.053
we'll go,
and we'll talk to him.

17:34.140 --> 17:35.576
Preciado owns a blue car.

17:38.361 --> 17:40.711
Can I have your salad? Thanks.

17:42.887 --> 17:44.802
[instrumental music]

17:51.113 --> 17:53.072
[indistinct chatter]

17:59.382 --> 18:03.473
Oh, Gladys Knight
and the pips.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.345
You brought
our prisoner back?

18:05.432 --> 18:08.913
Detective Preciado, we need to
sit down with you for a while.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.350
We have a few questions
for you.

18:10.437 --> 18:11.525
What questions?

18:11.612 --> 18:14.702
That's a .38 you carry,
isn't it?

18:14.789 --> 18:18.662
You trying to say it was me?
You miserable sons of bitches.

18:18.749 --> 18:20.011
Where the hell do you get
the nerve--

18:20.099 --> 18:21.665
Hold on, Steve. Cool it.
Let me handle this.

18:21.752 --> 18:23.841
No. No, this one's mine. Where
the hell do you get the nerve

18:23.928 --> 18:25.800
'to come up here in my town,
talking to me like that?'

18:25.887 --> 18:30.021
What weapon do I carry?
Kiss my ass.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.676
The California
State Constitution.

18:32.763 --> 18:34.635
We've come to you out here
out of respect.

18:34.722 --> 18:36.680
We could have found you in the
police station and made a fuss.

18:36.767 --> 18:38.291
You should be glad you didn't.

18:38.378 --> 18:40.293
No, you should be
glad we didn't.

18:42.164 --> 18:43.470
You have nothing on me.

18:43.557 --> 18:45.863
We can put you with Patrice.

18:45.950 --> 18:48.083
Her roommate, Lacey Wells,
ID'd you from a photo.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.738
Have a quiet talk with us clear
up a few things, no big deal.

18:50.825 --> 18:52.392
What couple of things?

18:52.479 --> 18:54.220
This doesn't concern you,
detective.

18:54.307 --> 18:55.438
Excuse me. He's my partner.

18:55.525 --> 18:57.223
Leave it alone, Dale.
Just leave it.

18:57.310 --> 19:00.008
I can handle this.
Let's go.

19:04.186 --> 19:05.318
Hi.

19:10.714 --> 19:12.803
Mmm. Good..

19:12.890 --> 19:14.327
Good to meet you again.

19:14.414 --> 19:15.545
Hey.

19:16.938 --> 19:18.635
What's the matter with him?

19:18.722 --> 19:20.115
How well did you know
Patrice Matigan?

19:20.202 --> 19:21.551
Let's not screw around here.

19:21.638 --> 19:23.945
Just tell me what you have,
cop to cop.

19:24.032 --> 19:26.513
Cop to cop? We know
you were giving her money.

19:26.600 --> 19:29.211
We know she got off
of a meth bust last Christmas.

19:29.298 --> 19:32.171
Evidence was lost, right?
From the Davis PD lockup?

19:32.258 --> 19:33.824
Happens.

19:33.911 --> 19:36.610
- We figure you took it.
- That's what you figure?

19:36.697 --> 19:38.916
Yes, and we could dig in
and prove it, but I don't want

19:39.003 --> 19:40.396
to spend any time
doing that.

19:40.483 --> 19:42.181
'I'd rather just talk
straight with you'

19:42.268 --> 19:45.575
'avoid dragging other good cops
into this mess, right?'

19:45.662 --> 19:47.664
Go on.

19:47.751 --> 19:51.581
We figure you and Patrice were
having a sexual relationship.

19:51.668 --> 19:53.757
[chuckles]

19:53.844 --> 19:55.933
She was..

19:56.020 --> 19:58.632
She was a
confidential informant.

19:58.719 --> 20:01.548
We considered that, but then
she'd be on file, right?

20:01.635 --> 20:04.420
And you would have put in
for the money as a CI expense

20:04.507 --> 20:06.901
but you didn't do that,
did you?

20:06.988 --> 20:09.947
'Why? My guess,
because you're an honest man.'

20:10.034 --> 20:11.993
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.997
I was banging her.
So what?

20:16.084 --> 20:17.825
Did you know she was
also in a relationship

20:17.912 --> 20:19.348
'with your missing witness?'

20:19.435 --> 20:22.351
We had a business relationship.
I paid her for sex.

20:22.438 --> 20:25.006
I didn't know or care what
she did when I wasn't there.

20:25.093 --> 20:27.356
'You paid her
a lot of money. A lot.'

20:27.443 --> 20:28.923
Good-looking man like you

20:29.010 --> 20:31.491
'there had to have been
more to it than that.'

20:31.578 --> 20:33.188
'Did she have something on you?'

20:33.275 --> 20:34.929
Well, she was punctual
and clean and didn't say much.

20:35.016 --> 20:36.409
I like that in a woman.

20:36.496 --> 20:37.932
Did you know your man
Joe Purcell was

20:38.019 --> 20:39.412
the father of her child?

20:39.499 --> 20:40.891
No.

20:40.978 --> 20:43.894
A lowlife junkie dealer
with your woman.

20:43.981 --> 20:45.331
How'd that make you feel?

20:45.418 --> 20:46.854
Couldn't care less.

20:47.985 --> 20:49.639
[clears throat]

20:49.726 --> 20:53.295
Do you, uh, want
the rest of my sandwich?

20:53.382 --> 20:54.688
- I can't finish it.
- What?

20:54.775 --> 20:56.820
- It's good sandwich.
- Good sandwich.

20:59.475 --> 21:00.911
What is wrong with him?

21:00.998 --> 21:04.263
Where were you at 12:45 a.m.
Monday morning?

21:04.350 --> 21:07.222
I was at my partner's.

21:07.309 --> 21:09.572
We watched the game.
I was too drunk to drive

21:09.659 --> 21:11.618
so I slept on the couch.

21:11.705 --> 21:13.446
At Blakely's?
Just you and him?

21:13.533 --> 21:14.969
And his wife.

21:15.056 --> 21:17.798
Do you have your weapon
on you?

21:17.885 --> 21:20.279
Yes, I do.

21:20.366 --> 21:22.106
Mind if we borrow it
for a while

21:22.193 --> 21:23.978
have ballistics
take a look at it?

21:25.762 --> 21:27.895
Look, I don't want to have
to make this official

21:27.982 --> 21:29.549
talk to a judge or anything.

21:29.636 --> 21:32.639
Once we do that, the cat's
out of the bag for good.

21:32.726 --> 21:36.033
If you're clean on this,
here's the way to prove it.

21:41.735 --> 21:43.780
Is this the only .38
in your possession?

21:43.867 --> 21:46.479
Yes, it is. And if you try
to hold my hand again

21:46.566 --> 21:47.741
I'm gonna tear your arm off

21:47.828 --> 21:51.048
and beat you unconscious
with it. Get me?

21:51.135 --> 21:52.311
Gotcha.

21:53.181 --> 21:54.791
Well?

21:54.878 --> 21:56.532
You know, it's just funny
what bad liars cops are.

21:56.619 --> 21:57.968
I guess they're not used to

21:58.055 --> 21:59.709
concealing themselves
under questioning.

21:59.796 --> 22:02.277
I'm a cop, and I lie to you all
the time. You never catch it.

22:02.364 --> 22:04.061
Well, sorry to burst
your bubble

22:04.148 --> 22:06.934
but you're translucent, my dear.
I always know when you're lying.

22:07.021 --> 22:08.631
Sometimes I let you think
you fooled me

22:08.718 --> 22:10.546
just so you don't feel bad.

22:10.633 --> 22:12.592
Name one time.

22:12.679 --> 22:14.811
Mm. Last thanksgiving you said
you were going back east

22:14.898 --> 22:17.161
to your brother's house, but I
knew you were actually planning

22:17.248 --> 22:18.554
on having three days
at home alone

22:18.641 --> 22:20.687
to watch old movies
and eat ice cream.

22:20.774 --> 22:23.080
Okay, so that's one time.

22:27.084 --> 22:28.608
What about Preciado?

22:28.695 --> 22:31.654
His stress pulse rate
was thready, dishonest.

22:31.741 --> 22:33.134
Thready?

22:33.221 --> 22:34.875
Hard to describe pulses.

22:34.962 --> 22:38.052
Uh, a dishonest pulse feels
different to an indignant pulse.

22:38.139 --> 22:40.881
In this case, hard to say
what he's lying about exactly

22:40.968 --> 22:43.927
'but he was signaling deception
from first to last.'

22:44.014 --> 22:46.234
There's something off about his
whole story. Where are we going?

22:46.321 --> 22:47.757
To the zoo.
They have new tiger cubs.

22:47.844 --> 22:49.977
Oh. Liar.

22:50.064 --> 22:52.588
Oh, very good. I'm gonna go
and speak with Blakely.

22:52.675 --> 22:54.155
Blakely's not gonna
tell you anything.

22:54.242 --> 22:55.461
Nah, Blakely's old-school.

22:55.548 --> 22:56.679
He'll back his partner
to the moon

22:56.766 --> 22:58.855
but his wife might
be less steadfast.

22:58.942 --> 23:00.683
I'll keep the husband
in the office while you go

23:00.770 --> 23:01.815
and talk to the wife.

23:01.902 --> 23:03.773
Ah. Sweet.

23:05.079 --> 23:07.951
[instrumental music]

23:20.877 --> 23:22.618
What is it?

23:22.705 --> 23:25.012
- Patrick Jane, CBI.
- Yeah, uh, what is it?

23:25.099 --> 23:27.275
I'd like to speak
with Katherine Blakely.

23:27.362 --> 23:30.147
Sam? Officer Sam Blakely?

23:30.234 --> 23:31.932
Yeah. Uh,
now isn't very convenient.

23:32.019 --> 23:33.281
Uh, if you want
to speak with her

23:33.368 --> 23:34.891
you should call
and arrange something.

23:34.978 --> 23:37.981
Yes, I was just passing by.
That's a shame, Sam.

23:38.068 --> 23:40.027
I really did need
to speak to her.

23:40.114 --> 23:42.638
[Katherine]
Who is it, Sam?

23:42.725 --> 23:44.684
CBI, ma'am.
Murder investigation.

23:44.771 --> 23:45.772
Murder investigation?

23:45.859 --> 23:47.469
The Purcell-Matigan killings?

23:47.556 --> 23:48.862
The couple I found.

23:48.949 --> 23:50.516
Oh, my Lord. Yes.

23:50.603 --> 23:52.953
Terrible thing.
That poor little baby.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.086
Well, I'll..
I'll leave you to it then.

23:56.173 --> 23:59.394
No, ma'am. It's.. You that
I wish to speak with.

24:02.223 --> 24:05.269
'I am so proud
of my two policemen.'

24:05.356 --> 24:06.880
'There are three generations'

24:06.967 --> 24:09.796
of Davis law enforcement
in this family. Three.

24:09.883 --> 24:12.755
'When people see
the Blakely name in Davis'

24:12.842 --> 24:14.670
they know that
it stands for something.

24:14.757 --> 24:15.976
Cripe sakes, ma.
That's enough.

24:16.063 --> 24:19.153
Oh, he hates me
bragging on him.

24:19.240 --> 24:22.199
So tell me, why on earth
do you want to ask me

24:22.286 --> 24:24.463
about these killings?

24:24.550 --> 24:28.728
Officer Blakely, could we have
a moment alone, please?

24:28.815 --> 24:30.904
It's okay.

24:30.991 --> 24:34.081
It's kind of confidential
stuff, ma'am.

24:34.168 --> 24:36.736
Well, go on, Sam.

24:36.823 --> 24:39.782
I don't think I should, mom.
Dad wouldn't like it.

24:39.869 --> 24:41.871
Well, you're not your dad.

24:41.958 --> 24:44.308
Just give us a moment.

24:44.395 --> 24:45.527
Go on.

24:51.620 --> 24:52.752
[clears throat]

24:57.060 --> 24:58.235
Mmm.

25:01.891 --> 25:03.893
Sam was so upset
that night.

25:03.980 --> 25:08.289
It was his first time coming up
on a killing. Poor thing.

25:08.376 --> 25:11.988
I remember the first time
Dale caught a bad call.

25:12.075 --> 25:16.036
We were newlyweds, and he came
home and he actually cried.

25:16.123 --> 25:17.733
Tried to hide it.

25:17.820 --> 25:19.779
But I told him
and I told Sam

25:19.866 --> 25:22.869
that there is no shame
in feeling sad.

25:22.956 --> 25:25.219
There isn't.

25:25.306 --> 25:28.048
You've experienced
the same thing, no doubt.

25:28.135 --> 25:30.050
Death is part of the job.

25:30.137 --> 25:31.965
Yes. Yes, it is.

25:32.052 --> 25:35.055
[chuckles]
Sorry. Rambling.

25:35.142 --> 25:38.145
What did you wanna
talk to me about, Mr. Jane?

25:38.232 --> 25:40.669
Ma'am, your husband's partner,
Detective Preciado

25:40.756 --> 25:42.715
is a person of interest
in the case.

25:42.802 --> 25:43.933
Steve? No.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.589
He said that he was here
at your house

25:47.676 --> 25:50.157
sleeping on your couch,
at the time of the murders.

25:50.244 --> 25:52.681
That was 12:45 a.m.
Monday morning.

25:52.768 --> 25:54.117
Was he here?

25:54.204 --> 25:57.251
Yes. Yes, he was.
He-he stayed the night.

25:57.338 --> 25:59.209
Why would you
be interested in Steve?

25:59.296 --> 26:00.863
He's such a straight arrow.

26:02.648 --> 26:04.954
He said that he was
having an affair

26:05.041 --> 26:06.477
with Patrice Matigan.

26:06.565 --> 26:09.045
[laughing]

26:09.132 --> 26:10.525
Steve Preciado?

26:10.612 --> 26:12.919
Yes. Why not?

26:13.006 --> 26:14.224
Uh, I don't know.

26:14.311 --> 26:18.707
It.. It.. It just
doesn't seem likely.

26:18.794 --> 26:20.970
Katherine,
you're hiding something.

26:22.711 --> 26:24.408
This is
a state investigation.

26:24.495 --> 26:27.368
You're obligated
to tell me the truth.

26:27.455 --> 26:29.109
Well, you have to promise

26:29.196 --> 26:31.154
that you will not say
it was me who spoke of it.

26:31.241 --> 26:33.069
I won't tell a soul.

26:33.156 --> 26:36.420
Well, Dale says
that Steve has a problem

26:36.507 --> 26:39.728
you know...down there?

26:39.815 --> 26:41.382
Down there.

26:41.469 --> 26:43.645
Oh.

26:43.732 --> 26:45.255
There's pills for that now.

26:45.342 --> 26:47.083
Yes.

26:47.170 --> 26:51.784
No. He's a hopeless case,
apparently.

26:51.871 --> 26:54.177
[chuckles]
Well, that's strange.

26:54.264 --> 26:57.050
That's very strange, 'cause
he's the one that told us

26:57.137 --> 26:59.008
he was having an affair
with Patrice.

26:59.095 --> 27:00.619
Oh, well, knowing Steve

27:00.706 --> 27:03.360
I'm sure he was lying
to protect his machismo

27:03.447 --> 27:05.885
or protecting someone else.

27:12.239 --> 27:14.850
Oh. I-I'm so sorry.
How stupid of me.

27:14.937 --> 27:17.679
- No, it's, it's..
- What happened?

27:17.766 --> 27:20.073
Nothing. It--it's just
a little accident.

27:20.160 --> 27:21.335
What did you say to her, huh?

27:21.422 --> 27:22.597
What do you..
What have you done?

27:22.684 --> 27:24.468
He's done nothing.
Your father..

27:24.555 --> 27:27.210
My father? What?
What did you tell her?

27:28.995 --> 27:30.779
You knew.

27:30.866 --> 27:33.652
You knew that's who she was.

27:33.739 --> 27:36.263
That's why the two of you have
been whispering in corners

27:36.350 --> 27:38.569
and acting so strange.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.181
No, ma.
You got it all wrong.

27:41.268 --> 27:42.704
You don't understand.

27:42.791 --> 27:45.446
Dad wasn't having an affair.

27:45.533 --> 27:46.665
[vehicle approaching]

27:56.283 --> 27:59.503
- Dad, mom thinks that--
- What, Sam? What do I think?

27:59.590 --> 28:01.244
You swore on his life.

28:01.331 --> 28:04.030
You swore on your son's life
you would never betray me again!

28:04.117 --> 28:05.596
Come inside, hon.
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.250
just not out here.

28:07.337 --> 28:09.078
Oh, no. Not out here.
You're Dale Blakely.

28:09.165 --> 28:10.732
You're one of the good guys.

28:10.819 --> 28:13.779
- Get in the house now!
- Detective Blakely..

28:13.866 --> 28:16.259
- Ooh!
- Shut your mouth.

28:16.346 --> 28:18.131
- You okay?
- Assault. Assault.

28:18.218 --> 28:20.786
I would rethink
this new technique of yours.

28:20.873 --> 28:23.397
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I can't disagree.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.803
[instrumental music]

28:45.158 --> 28:47.595
Now we're arresting them.
Hooray.

28:47.682 --> 28:49.205
We have the right.
He assaulted Jane

28:49.292 --> 28:50.729
and he looks good
for the murders.

28:50.816 --> 28:52.687
Before you charge a cop
with murder, you better look

28:52.774 --> 28:54.428
better than good. You better
look like the damn Mona Lisa.

28:54.515 --> 28:56.343
Yes, I hear..

28:56.430 --> 28:58.475
Because if you're wrong,
we will have no murder suspect

28:58.562 --> 29:00.042
the attorney general

29:00.129 --> 29:01.827
will have no narcotics
case against Carris

29:01.914 --> 29:03.654
And we will have
wrongly arrested

29:03.742 --> 29:07.571
a distinguished veteran officer
in his home jurisdiction.

29:07.658 --> 29:09.748
Yes, boss.

29:09.835 --> 29:11.271
[Kimball]
'What was the nature
of your relationship'

29:11.358 --> 29:12.794
'with Patrice Matigan?'

29:12.881 --> 29:14.317
I was helping her out.

29:14.404 --> 29:15.841
Helping her with close
to 1,000 bucks a month.

29:15.928 --> 29:17.451
That's a lot of help.

29:17.538 --> 29:19.235
What did she give you
in return?

29:19.322 --> 29:21.455
'Nothing.'

29:21.542 --> 29:24.632
[Kimball]
'Okay. What story did you tell
your wife about the money?'

29:26.765 --> 29:29.768
- I...got nothing left to say.
- How were you making ends meet?

29:29.855 --> 29:32.553
Did you maybe take a little
drug money now and again?

29:32.640 --> 29:36.035
I never took a penny.
Not a damn penny.

29:36.122 --> 29:38.124
So I guess if Patrice started
asking you for more money

29:38.211 --> 29:39.386
'you'd have been
hard-pressed, right?'

29:39.473 --> 29:41.562
Get me a lawyer.

29:41.649 --> 29:44.652
I'll set that up for you.

29:44.739 --> 29:47.263
Oh. Where's
your service revolver?

29:47.350 --> 29:49.091
Agent Rigsby tells me
you didn't have it with you.

29:49.178 --> 29:50.310
It was stolen.

29:50.397 --> 29:52.181
- Yeah?
- Yeah, from my car.

29:52.268 --> 29:55.837
Okay. It's no problem.
It happens.

29:55.924 --> 29:59.319
- A .38, was it?
- That's right.

29:59.406 --> 30:01.016
I'll get you that lawyer.

30:04.454 --> 30:06.195
He's not gonna talk.

30:06.282 --> 30:07.806
Poor soul.

30:07.893 --> 30:10.112
He made his bed.
He can lie in it.

30:10.199 --> 30:11.897
You know, I never really
understood that one.

30:11.984 --> 30:13.246
Just 'cause someone
makes their bed

30:13.333 --> 30:14.813
why do they have to lie in it?

30:14.900 --> 30:17.076
What's to stop them
from lying in another bed

30:17.163 --> 30:18.991
or on the floor,
for that matter?

30:20.601 --> 30:23.952
Sam Blakely's here.

30:24.039 --> 30:25.475
Come on.

30:28.261 --> 30:29.392
[Rick chuckles]

30:31.003 --> 30:32.352
[indistinct chatter]

30:32.439 --> 30:33.701
I wasn't gonna call you..

30:38.097 --> 30:40.055
Officer Blakely,
thanks for coming.

30:40.142 --> 30:41.927
I got no choice.
You have my father locked up.

30:42.014 --> 30:43.624
Is your mother okay?

30:43.711 --> 30:45.234
Don't worry about my mother.
My father is innocent.

30:45.321 --> 30:46.670
We know that.

30:46.757 --> 30:48.455
You people are
making a big.. What?

30:48.542 --> 30:50.718
We know your father
didn't do it.

30:55.941 --> 30:57.856
This is from the
security cameras

30:57.943 --> 30:59.553
in the liquor store
in front of the motel.

30:59.640 --> 31:01.163
We finally
got to look at it today.

31:01.250 --> 31:04.514
This is at 12:40 a.m.

31:04.601 --> 31:06.647
[Grace]
'That's Patrice Matigan's
car arriving.'

31:09.389 --> 31:11.347
'And that is Rick Carris' man.'

31:12.914 --> 31:14.524
We misjudged Carris.

31:14.611 --> 31:17.092
He found Patrice,
had a man follow her.

31:17.179 --> 31:18.746
You can see his license plate
right there.

31:18.833 --> 31:21.792
- Can you make that bigger?
- Yes, we can.

31:23.707 --> 31:25.057
[Grace]
'We know who it is.'

31:25.144 --> 31:27.450
A thug that works
for Rick Carris named q-tip.

31:27.537 --> 31:30.627
But get this. Carris says
q-tip didn't kill him.

31:30.714 --> 31:33.282
Q-tip went to kill Joe,
but he got there too late.

31:33.369 --> 31:35.023
Someone else got to him first.

31:35.110 --> 31:36.938
Well, that's gotta be
a bunch of bull.

31:37.025 --> 31:40.463
Carris sayshis man q-tip
actually saw the real killer

31:40.550 --> 31:43.989
saw the whole thing.
So Carris is offering us a deal.

31:44.076 --> 31:45.816
If we let him out,
his man q-tip

31:45.904 --> 31:48.819
will tell us exactly what
he saw, ID the real killer.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.604
And you believe him?

31:50.691 --> 31:52.998
Of course not.
It's a transparent con.

31:53.085 --> 31:54.347
Q-tip killed him alright.

31:54.434 --> 31:56.044
Carris is just trying
to save his skin

31:56.131 --> 31:57.698
by laying the blame elsewhere.

31:57.785 --> 32:00.135
On your father probably.

32:00.222 --> 32:02.398
He must have known about
his connection to Patrice.

32:02.485 --> 32:06.794
So we're gonna play along,
let the shooter come to us.

32:06.881 --> 32:08.578
Carris has set up
a meeting with q-tip tonight.

32:08.665 --> 32:12.495
So we'll grab up q-tip and work
him until we get the real story.

32:12.582 --> 32:14.715
So, uh, what do you
need me for exactly?

32:14.802 --> 32:16.282
If this is gonna work

32:16.369 --> 32:18.806
I can't have a whole bunch
of angry Davis PD.

32:18.893 --> 32:21.548
Swarming all over Carris
and his crew.

32:21.635 --> 32:24.812
And the CBI is kind of unpopular
with you guys, right now.

32:24.899 --> 32:27.554
- Yes, you are.
- 'So..'

32:27.641 --> 32:30.296
We were hoping you'd have
a quiet word with your chief

32:30.383 --> 32:32.602
let him know
what we're up to.

32:32.689 --> 32:35.040
Well, knowing the chief, he's
gonna want to know the details

32:35.127 --> 32:37.956
um, when and where you're
gonna be meeting this q-tip

32:38.043 --> 32:40.828
and what personnel you got
operating undercover?

32:40.915 --> 32:44.440
Sure. But this needs to stay
close between you and the chief.

32:44.527 --> 32:47.052
We don't want
to spook Carris.

32:47.139 --> 32:49.706
He thinks he's playing us
for a bunch of idiots.

32:49.793 --> 32:51.143
Mm. I understand.

32:54.624 --> 32:57.540
[dramatic music]

33:13.730 --> 33:16.385
[Teresa]
'Okay, team.
Let the games begin.'

33:16.472 --> 33:17.996
Carris is on his way,
He's gonna make the call

33:18.083 --> 33:19.432
when he makes
the meet with q-tip.

33:19.519 --> 33:21.434
Be ready to act fast. Clear?

33:23.784 --> 33:26.700
- Got it.
- Okay.

33:26.787 --> 33:27.962
Roger that.

33:34.838 --> 33:36.014
[radio static]

33:38.320 --> 33:40.061
The warehouse is
on Fifth and Geary.

33:40.148 --> 33:42.281
Loading dock in the back.
Q-tip's in the same car

33:42.368 --> 33:43.934
'he was on the tape.
California plate'

33:44.022 --> 33:47.025
5-Nora-Tom-Queen-9-5-7.

33:47.112 --> 33:48.722
'Be there in ten minutes.'

33:48.809 --> 33:51.072
Ten minutes? I can't get to
Fifth and Geary in ten minutes.

33:51.159 --> 33:52.769
Well, do your best.

33:56.991 --> 33:59.863
On our way. ETA to Geary
and Fifth.. 12 minutes.

34:04.520 --> 34:06.522
Damn it.
He won't wait that long.

34:11.136 --> 34:14.269
Officer Blakely, are you closer
to Fifth and Geary?

34:18.143 --> 34:20.754
[Patrick]
'Officer Blakely? Sam?'

34:24.975 --> 34:27.891
[dramatic music]

34:56.833 --> 34:58.618
[tires screeching]

34:58.705 --> 34:59.880
[siren wailing]

35:04.145 --> 35:06.669
- Blakely, drop the gun!
- Drop it!

35:25.514 --> 35:28.038
Carris never made a deal,
did he?

35:28.126 --> 35:29.475
No.

35:29.562 --> 35:32.304
We, uh, edited
the surveillance footage.

35:32.391 --> 35:34.132
Q-tip was just some guy

35:34.219 --> 35:36.395
'that happened to walk up
to the motel at some point'

35:36.482 --> 35:38.048
and, uh, Van Pelt--

35:38.136 --> 35:42.052
she laid in the license plate
with, uh, Photoshop.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.925
That's clever.
Kudos to you guys.

35:45.012 --> 35:47.232
We know you're
a decent man, Sam.

35:47.319 --> 35:50.104
We know you didn't mean
for things to go down like this.

35:50.191 --> 35:52.889
- 'Just tell us what happened.'
- I got nothing to say.

35:52.976 --> 35:55.327
There's no use
in hiding anything now.

35:55.414 --> 35:58.286
There's no use
in explaining either.

36:01.550 --> 36:05.337
Mm. Take a seat, detective.

36:05.424 --> 36:06.860
Thank you.

36:10.951 --> 36:12.909
- Son.
- Dad.

36:18.088 --> 36:21.657
Well, there's, there's always
a reckoning. This is it.

36:21.744 --> 36:25.313
Just.. Just tell them the truth.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.750
The truth, huh?

36:27.837 --> 36:30.231
Tell the truth
no matter what.

36:30.318 --> 36:33.103
That's the mark of a man,
right, dad? Tell the truth.

36:33.191 --> 36:36.411
A man has his honor
and his word, and that's it.

36:36.498 --> 36:38.848
Don't go over the same ground
for god sake.

36:38.935 --> 36:41.373
- 'Just give 'em the facts.'
- 'You want the facts? Okay.'

36:41.460 --> 36:44.114
Mom suspected that dad was
having an affair.

36:44.202 --> 36:45.899
'Well, I asked around
on the street.'

36:45.986 --> 36:49.119
Pretty soon I hear that
he's keeping this girl

36:49.207 --> 36:53.733
'Patrice Matigan,
on the side.'

36:53.820 --> 36:55.778
I was mad as hell.

36:55.865 --> 36:57.345
You gotta understand.

36:57.432 --> 36:59.956
This integrity crap was banged
into me my entire life.

37:00.043 --> 37:01.610
Right, dad?

37:01.697 --> 37:04.657
Honesty, honor, family--
banged into me

37:04.744 --> 37:06.746
and then all this time, he's
keeping a whore on the side?

37:06.833 --> 37:11.751
No. Never. I went and I asked
him if it was true

37:11.838 --> 37:14.275
and he said no.

37:14.362 --> 37:18.497
I knew he was lying to me.
I knew it.

37:18.584 --> 37:21.543
So Sunday night I..
Went back to find the truth.

37:23.676 --> 37:26.418
I thought, for sure,
she was gonna meet dad.

37:26.505 --> 37:30.335
[Sam]
And she went to the store,
went to a motel.

37:32.511 --> 37:35.470
I thought,
huh, I got him now.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.049
Purcell must have thought

37:49.136 --> 37:52.879
I'd been sent by Carris
to kill him. I had no choice.

38:03.672 --> 38:05.152
'I panicked.'

38:06.501 --> 38:08.895
I drove away.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.681
And dispatch called

38:12.768 --> 38:15.728
sent me right back
to the motel.

38:15.815 --> 38:19.862
I was the closest unit. What was
I gonna do? Refuse the call?

38:19.949 --> 38:21.603
I had to take it.

38:27.783 --> 38:30.482
[Patrick]
'There's always a reckoning.'

38:30.569 --> 38:33.223
Patrice wasn't your mistress,
was she?

38:35.487 --> 38:36.618
No.

38:40.056 --> 38:43.233
She was my daughter,
Sam's sister.

38:45.540 --> 38:47.499
How did you know?

38:47.586 --> 38:50.458
[Patrick]
'Sam told his mother
you weren't cheating on her.'

38:50.545 --> 38:53.331
I believed him.
But then who was Patrice?

38:55.463 --> 38:57.422
Who was she to you?

38:57.509 --> 38:59.075
And why all the secrecy?

38:59.162 --> 39:02.122
I just figured she had
to have been your daughter.

39:02.209 --> 39:05.386
I never knew Patrice existed
until four years ago.

39:06.474 --> 39:08.215
'Her mother was dying.'

39:08.302 --> 39:10.217
'So..'

39:10.304 --> 39:11.697
'She got in touch'

39:13.002 --> 39:14.743
Told me I had..

39:14.830 --> 39:18.268
'I had a 16-year-old child
I never knew about.'

39:20.401 --> 39:22.621
Blew my mind. Just..

39:24.187 --> 39:25.667
Oh, blew my mind.

39:27.582 --> 39:31.151
'You know, I wanted to tell
Katherine the truth but..'

39:32.674 --> 39:35.721
Y-you know, I..

39:35.808 --> 39:37.592
Oh, my God.

39:39.638 --> 39:41.291
'I couldn't do it.'

39:43.206 --> 39:46.384
'I just couldn't hurt her
like that.'

39:46.471 --> 39:49.038
- Does she know now?
- Yeah, she knows.

39:50.823 --> 39:52.390
She knows.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.788

40:40.176 --> 40:41.656
Sorry. Busy right now.

40:41.743 --> 40:43.615
[Patrick]
'Katherine, it's Patrick Jane.'

40:43.702 --> 40:45.443
'Can you open the door?'

40:45.530 --> 40:47.009
I can't.

40:47.096 --> 40:48.794
[Patrick]
'You can and you will.'

40:48.881 --> 40:51.579
'I have something
I need to give you.'

40:57.280 --> 41:00.458
This is Kaylee, your
granddaughter, kind of.

41:00.545 --> 41:01.676
'Here.'

41:03.896 --> 41:05.941
She's very fond of Cheerios.

41:06.028 --> 41:07.726
That's, uh, that has
nothing to do with me.

41:07.813 --> 41:09.423
And she likes to take
her big nap at 2:00.

41:09.510 --> 41:10.903
But.. What?

41:10.990 --> 41:12.252
You're all she has.

41:12.339 --> 41:13.775
Social services
will be along later

41:13.862 --> 41:16.691
to get the paperwork signed.

41:16.778 --> 41:19.215
The name Kaylee doesn't really
suit her, if you ask me.

41:19.302 --> 41:21.696
If you want to change it, I'm
sure no one will make a fuss.

41:21.783 --> 41:26.309
Oh. Oh. Hey.
You might need those. Bye.
