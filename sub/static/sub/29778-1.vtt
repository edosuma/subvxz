00:10.920 --> 00:12.416
<i>And those
who commit crimes</i>

00:12.440 --> 00:14.397
<i>should be punished,</i>

00:14.440 --> 00:19.196
<i>and those who commit repeated
violent crimes should be told,</i>

00:19.240 --> 00:21.391
<i>"When you commit
a third violent crime,</i>

00:21.440 --> 00:24.353
<i>you will be put away
and put away for good.</i>

00:24.400 --> 00:26.357
<i>Three strikes,
and you are out."</i>

00:27.720 --> 00:28.736
<i>...going to be incarcerated,</i>

00:28.760 --> 00:30.672
<i>but the people's families.</i>

00:30.720 --> 00:32.735
<i>It affects our community.</i>

00:32.759 --> 00:34.696
<i>- If you look at California...
- It's the classic sacred cow.</i>

00:34.720 --> 00:36.837
<i>We live in a country
with consequences.</i>

00:36.880 --> 00:39.395
<i>You steal, you cheat, you rob
someone, you go to jail.</i>

00:39.440 --> 00:41.176
<i>So you think you should
lock somebody up</i>

00:41.200 --> 00:43.920
<i>potentially for a life sentence
or 25 years to life</i>

00:43.960 --> 00:45.216
<i>because they smoked
a little weed?</i>

00:45.240 --> 00:46.720
<i>...nonviolent offenses,</i>

00:46.760 --> 00:48.120
<i>but three strikes
is three strikes.</i>

00:48.160 --> 00:49.799
<i>...normally a misdemeanor...</i>

00:49.840 --> 00:52.275
<i>- Even a pizza?
- Even a pizza.</i>

00:52.320 --> 00:54.357
<i>...intersect with things</i>

00:54.400 --> 00:56.517
<i>like class
and race disparities.</i>

00:56.560 --> 00:58.136
<i>You already had
two strikes before.</i>

00:58.160 --> 00:59.536
<i>I don't understand
why this is an issue.</i>

00:59.560 --> 01:00.960
<i>That third strike has proven</i>

01:01.000 --> 01:02.559
<i>to not reduce crime
in any way.</i>

01:02.600 --> 01:04.592
<i>It's only thrown people's lives
away for years.</i>

01:04.640 --> 01:06.632
<i>We overreached.
We launched a war on drugs.</i>

01:06.680 --> 01:10.037
<i>...reevaluate the whole
way we've dealt with prison.</i>

01:10.080 --> 01:14.233
<i>...that the black
community has suffered through.</i>

01:14.280 --> 01:17.398
<i>We cannot simply
prosecute or incarcerate</i>

01:17.440 --> 01:19.716
<i>our way
to becoming a safer nation.</i>

01:19.760 --> 01:23.356
<i>I absolutely apologize
for voting for that bill.</i>

01:23.400 --> 01:26.518
<i>...to spend taxpayer money</i>

01:26.560 --> 01:29.029
<i>to keep nonviolent people
in prison.</i>

01:29.080 --> 01:32.357
<i>These first two
offenses were not significant,</i>

01:32.400 --> 01:35.234
<i>and I made a mistake,
and I'm sorry.</i>

01:35.280 --> 01:37.351
- Millings.
<i>- I'm really sorry.</i>

01:37.400 --> 01:40.199
Millings.

01:40.240 --> 01:42.232
At 5:00, okay?

02:37.880 --> 02:40.270
Okay, Millings.

02:40.320 --> 02:45.190
Let's go.
It's game time, buddy.

02:47.240 --> 02:50.074
On the move.

02:50.120 --> 02:52.555
Hey, good luck out there,
Millings.

03:13.240 --> 03:15.118
Step aside.
Step aside.

03:30.520 --> 03:32.557
- Russell Millings?
- Mm-hmm.

03:32.600 --> 03:35.115
Big day.

03:35.160 --> 03:37.117
Wilson.

03:37.160 --> 03:38.879
All right.

03:38.920 --> 03:41.071
Got your personal belongings
from entry.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.440
This is yours.

03:42.480 --> 03:44.551
We also got you
a change of clothes.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.193
- Okay.
- Let's go.

03:54.920 --> 03:56.593
You better stop
texting at work.

03:58.640 --> 04:00.336
You're walking like
you don't want to leave.

04:00.360 --> 04:01.555
What's up?

04:03.200 --> 04:05.078
You okay?

04:07.520 --> 04:09.876
Okay, I want you to quickly
change into those.

04:09.920 --> 04:11.320
Take a seat right there,
okay?

04:11.360 --> 04:14.273
An administrator is gonna
come in and talk to you.

05:10.880 --> 05:14.840
Mr. Millings?
I am Tracy Westmore.

05:14.880 --> 05:18.715
I am going to need your
signature on these documents.

05:18.760 --> 05:20.592
Okay?
Here's my pen.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.199
Sign right there, please.

05:24.600 --> 05:26.557
Okay.
Very good.

05:26.600 --> 05:29.274
I'll need you
to sign right there.

05:29.320 --> 05:30.800
Okay.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.296
Do you have any more
questions for me?

05:32.320 --> 05:33.879
Um...

05:33.920 --> 05:36.389
Okay.
You know what?

05:36.480 --> 05:38.073
Let's get you out of here.
All right?

05:38.120 --> 05:41.079
So just grab your stuff.
Follow me.

05:41.120 --> 05:42.554
Pleasure.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.274
I left my blues
on that table there.

05:46.320 --> 05:48.198
You don't need them.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.399
Best of luck out there,
Russell.

06:24.440 --> 06:25.999
Okay.

06:27.440 --> 06:29.352
One day at a time.

06:51.920 --> 06:53.752
Okay, Russell.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.154
I got to get you
off the clock.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.317
Morning shift
can put the rest away.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.436
<i>Next stop...</i>

08:37.320 --> 08:39.198
<i>- Whatever.
- Who the cares?</i>

08:39.240 --> 08:41.708
<i>That's stupid.</i>

08:41.760 --> 08:44.035
<i>It's not a big deal.</i>

08:45.600 --> 08:46.920
<i>Okay, whatever.</i>

08:46.960 --> 08:48.440
<i>I wanted you
to meet me.</i>

08:48.480 --> 08:50.199
<i>- I wanted to meet you.
- No, you didn't.</i>

08:50.240 --> 08:51.993
<i>You missed the flight,
you missed the boat,</i>

08:52.040 --> 08:52.920
<i>you missed the bus.</i>

08:52.921 --> 08:54.479
<i>I'm so mad at you.</i>

08:54.520 --> 08:56.056
<i>I don't care
if you're mad at me.</i>

08:56.080 --> 08:57.799
<i>You know I always want you
to be happy.</i>

08:57.840 --> 09:00.435
<i>Don't lie.
Tell me.</i>

09:00.480 --> 09:02.073
<i>You're mad at me,</i>

09:03.760 --> 09:06.878
<i>Terrifying car chase
ends in comedy.</i>

09:09.880 --> 09:12.190
<i>Thanks again, Ben.
Okay. After the break...</i>

09:12.280 --> 09:14.875
<i>The Santa Ana winds
are gonna start in the a.m.,</i>

09:14.920 --> 09:16.639
<i>and they won't let up
till late,</i>

09:16.680 --> 09:18.239
<i>or early Thursday morning.</i>

09:18.280 --> 09:19.576
I'm real proud of you,
you know?

09:19.600 --> 09:21.114
It's a little bittersweet.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.595
It's gonna be our last meeting
in person.

09:23.640 --> 09:26.951
Your parole will be satisfied
in a few months,

09:27.000 --> 09:28.639
and then you can start
to start over,

09:28.680 --> 09:31.559
but I am gonna need those
PPRs every other Tuesday, okay?

09:31.600 --> 09:32.920
- Mm-hmm.
- On my desk.

09:32.960 --> 09:34.394
Okay.
And mail them here?

09:35.960 --> 09:39.192
No. No, you can just...
you can just e-mail them to me.

09:39.240 --> 09:40.674
Nobody mails anything anymore.

09:40.720 --> 09:43.713
- Yeah, but that...
- Okay? So...

09:43.760 --> 09:45.160
Look, have you not...

09:45.200 --> 09:46.576
have you not gotten
an e-mail address yet?

09:46.600 --> 09:48.353
No, I didn't.
Well, I did. No, I did.

09:48.440 --> 09:52.070
I did, but the trouble is that
if you want to get an e-mail,

09:52.120 --> 09:54.157
like, you have to have
an e-mail,

09:54.200 --> 09:56.669
and if you don't have an e-mail,
it... it doesn't...

09:56.720 --> 09:58.632
Okay, Russell, then just
figure it out, okay?

09:58.680 --> 10:00.273
Just figure it out.

10:00.320 --> 10:01.816
You do not want to fudge up
these last few steps.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.680
All right? We don't need you
sliding backwards.

10:03.720 --> 10:05.439
It is not pretty.
I have seen it. Okay?

10:05.480 --> 10:08.393
So you just don't...
don't step in it again.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.159
- Okay, Russell?
- Mm-hmm.

10:10.200 --> 10:13.477
- Do not step in it.
- Okay.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.239
All right? All right.
You're a good man.

10:15.280 --> 10:18.034
- You keep going.
- Yeah.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.356
- Okay? Yeah?
- Okay.

10:27.680 --> 10:30.240
<i>Welcome to Troy's Burgers.
How can I help you?</i>

10:45.920 --> 10:47.400
Hi.

10:47.440 --> 10:49.238
Um, I'd like
to use the Internet.

10:49.280 --> 10:50.839
Okay.

10:58.120 --> 11:00.794
- Just any... anywhere?
- Go wherever. Yeah.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.756
So then you just...
you just scroll up.

11:33.800 --> 11:35.029
Just scroll?

11:35.080 --> 11:37.675
And then you just type in,
like,

11:37.720 --> 11:40.394
whoever or whatever you're
looking for in the search field.

11:40.440 --> 11:41.440
What's your dad's name?

11:41.480 --> 11:42.709
David Millings.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.558
David.
All right.

11:46.680 --> 11:48.114
So you got a lot of hits,

11:48.160 --> 11:50.629
so you're gonna have to
narrow down your search.

11:50.680 --> 11:53.991
Like, uh, you could do his,
like, middle name or...

11:54.040 --> 11:58.159
or put in your mom's name too,
I guess.

11:58.200 --> 12:01.272
Hey, is it cool if I take
a picture with you real quick?

12:01.320 --> 12:03.880
I mean, it's just that

12:03.920 --> 12:07.038
how often is it that you meet
someone who's never been online?

12:51.480 --> 12:52.709
It's okay, Russ.

12:52.760 --> 12:54.399
It's the first time
you've been late.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.336
I'm just glad I didn't have
to call Derek to cover.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.716
Just try to remember
that breaks are 15 minutes

12:58.760 --> 13:00.016
unless you're pulling
a double, okay?

13:00.040 --> 13:03.033
Okay.
I can't lose this job.

13:03.080 --> 13:05.470
Russ, you're not gonna
lose this job, okay?

13:05.520 --> 13:07.910
Hell, I wish I had 10 of you.
Just relax.

13:58.520 --> 14:00.716
Whoo!
Yeah!

14:02.200 --> 14:05.716
Hey, hurry up.
There's no line.

14:51.560 --> 14:54.234
Russ.

14:54.280 --> 14:57.273
I need a dumpster run,
and then take your lunch.

15:02.360 --> 15:05.034
Hey, Russ.
Can you do a double tonight?

15:05.080 --> 15:06.719
Okay.
Yeah, I guess.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.376
I mean, I hate to ask,
but Derek is sick,

15:08.400 --> 15:09.959
and Todd's already
into his overtime.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.434
Okay.

15:11.480 --> 15:12.960
You're the best.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.992
- Hey, Becca?
- Yeah?

15:15.040 --> 15:17.600
Is it cool if...
if I run an errand over...

15:17.640 --> 15:18.960
over there for a minute?

15:19.000 --> 15:20.753
What?

15:20.800 --> 15:23.634
Is it okay if I...
if I run an errand over there

15:23.680 --> 15:25.512
if... if it's really quick?

15:25.560 --> 15:27.416
Duh! You're on break.
You can do whatever you want.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.560
Long as you come back on time.
Just don't be a weirdo.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.557
Okay.
Thanks.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.876
Okay.
Welcome.

15:33.920 --> 15:36.640
<i>Welcome to Troy's Burger's.
How can I help you?</i>

15:38.040 --> 15:39.536
You don't...
You don't have a cellphone?

15:39.560 --> 15:40.835
<i>No.</i>

15:40.880 --> 15:42.553
And you don't have
an e-mail address?

15:47.880 --> 15:50.839
That's...
That's fucking cool, man.

15:50.880 --> 15:54.078
Where the fuck you been, dude?
In prison?

15:54.120 --> 15:55.474
Yeah.

15:56.600 --> 15:57.920
Oh, shit.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.896
Wait, y-you would have had to
been in there for what, like...

16:01.920 --> 16:03.798
20 years.

16:03.840 --> 16:05.433
- 20 years?
- 21, yeah.

16:05.480 --> 16:06.480
Holy shit.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.638
Damn, dude.
What...

16:12.080 --> 16:15.039
Hey, is it okay if I ask?
Did you, like...

16:15.080 --> 16:16.719
I-It was possession
of narcotics

16:16.760 --> 16:18.240
with the intent
to distribute.

16:18.280 --> 16:19.816
You did 20 years in prison
for dealing drugs?

16:19.840 --> 16:21.336
Well, how many pounds
were you slinging?

16:21.360 --> 16:23.431
An ounce.

16:23.480 --> 16:24.709
Of pot.

16:24.760 --> 16:27.355
Shut the fuck up.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.631
You are literally fucking me
right now.

16:29.680 --> 16:31.831
I'm not
literally fucking you.

16:31.880 --> 16:33.394
I'm not.

16:33.440 --> 16:35.591
Well, then how the...

16:36.760 --> 16:39.036
Wh... What?

16:39.080 --> 16:40.719
You're not black.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.736
It was my third offense
in the state of California,

16:42.760 --> 16:45.480
so it was my third strike.

16:45.520 --> 16:47.239
Wait,
they still do that shit?

16:47.280 --> 16:48.873
No, they don't do it anymore.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.389
Well, you know it's practically
legal now, right?

16:59.240 --> 17:01.914
Dude, let...
let's get you an e-mail.

17:12.119 --> 17:13.415
Hey, so how much longer,
you think?

17:13.440 --> 17:14.954
Oh, I have... have this,

17:15.000 --> 17:17.560
I have the women's,
and then the trash.

17:17.599 --> 17:20.115
Okay.
So I'm gonna skate early.

17:20.160 --> 17:21.799
Are you cool closing up?

17:21.839 --> 17:23.593
This is my spare key
to the back door,

17:23.640 --> 17:25.074
and the office
is already locked.

17:25.119 --> 17:26.679
But if I lock the door
behind me,

17:26.720 --> 17:28.154
w-what do I do with the key?

17:28.200 --> 17:29.536
You just give it back
to me tomorrow.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.199
But I don't work till Saturday.

17:31.240 --> 17:33.357
It's cool.
You can give it to me then.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.880
I'm gonna... I'm gonna make a...
a call, okay?

20:04.400 --> 20:05.993
Uh.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.076
It's locked.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.319
Maybe I...

20:37.160 --> 20:38.879
E-Ella?

20:49.320 --> 20:50.640
Hi.

20:53.680 --> 20:55.273
Oh.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.154
Hi.

21:21.120 --> 21:22.793
Hi.

21:22.840 --> 21:26.595
Hi, hi.

21:30.440 --> 21:32.033
Hi.

21:34.240 --> 21:35.356
Hi.

21:42.160 --> 21:43.958
Hi.

21:47.320 --> 21:48.959
Hi.

21:55.160 --> 21:56.514
Hey.

22:10.560 --> 22:11.755
Hi.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.556
911.
What's your emergency?

22:46.600 --> 22:49.718
Um...
I, um...

22:49.760 --> 22:52.195
Sir, I can't understand you.
You're gonna have to speak up.

22:52.240 --> 22:54.038
There's no emergency.

22:56.760 --> 22:59.480
Shit.
Stupid.

23:59.920 --> 24:01.479
Are you Russell Millings?

24:02.640 --> 24:04.916
Yeah.

24:04.960 --> 24:06.189
I'm me.

24:06.240 --> 24:08.516
Can you open the door,
please?

24:11.720 --> 24:13.916
We're, uh, following up
on a 911 call

24:13.960 --> 24:15.235
you made earlier this evening.

24:15.280 --> 24:17.431
Did you have an emergency?

24:17.480 --> 24:20.154
I... I didn't,
and I told them.

24:20.200 --> 24:21.216
Do you have your license
on you?

24:21.240 --> 24:23.357
I have an I.D. card.

24:23.440 --> 24:25.909
That'll do.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.235
Is that your child
in there?

24:32.120 --> 24:33.120
Yeah.

24:33.121 --> 24:34.919
Boy or girl?

24:36.160 --> 24:37.753
Girl.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.439
Okay.

24:39.480 --> 24:41.456
Do you mind grabbing that I.D.
for me, Mr. Millings?

25:18.600 --> 25:20.239
Okay, Mr. Millings.

25:20.280 --> 25:21.873
Sorry to have disturbed
you tonight.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.991
I'll let you get back
to the little lady.

25:29.280 --> 25:32.239
Tummy massage.
She's got colic.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.555
You got to massage
her tummy.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.080
Look, now,
you can get colic tabs,

25:35.120 --> 25:36.936
but someone once told me
about a tummy massage,

25:36.960 --> 25:39.216
and we always found that that
worked best on my little guy.

25:39.240 --> 25:41.835
Hang in there.
It gets better.

25:43.640 --> 25:44.994
All right.
You have a good night.

25:45.040 --> 25:46.315
Good night.

26:00.240 --> 26:01.594

You are hungry.

28:24.840 --> 28:27.071
Okay, okay, okay. Hold on.

28:41.560 --> 28:45.190
Excuse me. Do you know
where colic medicine is?

28:45.240 --> 28:46.594
Aisle four in the middle.

28:46.640 --> 28:49.235
- Aisle four in the mi...
- Wait a minute.

28:49.280 --> 28:51.749
How old is your baby?

28:51.800 --> 28:55.430
Um, three or four months,
I guess.

28:55.480 --> 28:58.598
You guess?
Give me this bottle.

28:58.640 --> 29:00.279
You don't need to be using
these bottles

29:00.320 --> 29:02.960
for a colicky baby, okay?

29:03.000 --> 29:05.913
These bottles are for infants,
not newborns.

29:05.960 --> 29:08.191
Ooh, goodness.
My feet hurt.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.436
See, you need the bottles
with the vent system.

29:10.480 --> 29:14.474
The vent system keeps that air
off of them bellies.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.591
Bet you the mama
does all of the work.

29:16.640 --> 29:18.279
No, she...

29:18.320 --> 29:21.074
Well, do... do you have
the vent-system bottles here?

29:21.120 --> 29:22.440
I don't have a lot of time.
Yeah.

29:22.480 --> 29:23.994
I'm taking them to you
right now.

29:24.040 --> 29:25.872
Aisle four in the middle,
right here.

29:25.920 --> 29:27.912
- Well...
- Okay.

29:27.960 --> 29:29.599
Now these are
all of our bottles.

29:29.640 --> 29:31.680
Here the colic tabs.
I like the gripe water, though.

29:34.080 --> 29:37.630
Now, how are you burping
the baby after you feed it?

29:37.680 --> 29:39.080
I mean,
because a lot of people

29:39.120 --> 29:40.873
make the mistake
of patting the baby.

29:40.920 --> 29:43.560
You don't need to pat a baby.
You got to bounce that baby.

29:43.600 --> 29:45.876
- Is it a boy or girl?
- It's a girl.

29:45.920 --> 29:47.036
Oh!
What's her name?

29:47.080 --> 29:48.799
- Ella.
- Ella?

29:48.840 --> 29:51.071
Like Ella Fitzgerald!
♪ Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo ♪

29:51.120 --> 29:53.032
That's...
I got five rock-head boys.

29:53.080 --> 29:54.673
- I can't stand them.
- But...

29:54.720 --> 29:56.837
Now, what you want to do is,
you want to bounce Ella.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.360
Don't pat.
Bounce Ella.

29:58.440 --> 30:00.636
Bounce that burp
right out of Ella.

30:00.680 --> 30:02.911
I bet you that wife of yours
is patting.

30:02.960 --> 30:04.474
That's why she got that colic.

30:06.560 --> 30:07.856
- That right over there.
- The pink one?

30:07.880 --> 30:08.880
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

30:08.881 --> 30:11.157
Is your wife breastfeeding?

30:11.200 --> 30:13.510
- Is she what?
- Does she breastfeed?

30:13.560 --> 30:15.472
- Oh, no.
- No?

30:15.520 --> 30:17.591
And what kind of formula
are you using?

30:17.640 --> 30:19.916
Hydrolyzed, soy, casein?

30:22.560 --> 30:24.392
I wouldn't use that casein.

30:24.440 --> 30:26.159
That casein,
something wrong with it.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.998
They trying to trick us,

30:28.040 --> 30:31.317
because those babies get sick,
and probably cause that colic.

30:31.360 --> 30:33.556
I would use the hydrolyzed
because the hydrolyzed

30:33.600 --> 30:35.193
is better
on the digestive system.

30:35.240 --> 30:38.756
Thank you very much.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.234

I've lived in California
almost 25 years,

33:37.480 --> 33:40.154
and I've never been
to the beach.

33:41.400 --> 33:43.437
I had kind of an idea.

33:46.640 --> 33:49.951
Would you want to spend the day
at the ocean with me?

33:52.280 --> 33:54.033
Is that a yes?

33:54.080 --> 33:56.720

34:23.320 --> 34:24.913
Look, Ella.

35:00.200 --> 35:01.759
Here.

35:08.040 --> 35:11.431
Did I ever tell you that my dad
used to collect stamps?

35:11.480 --> 35:13.756
He had an incredible collection.

35:13.840 --> 35:16.639
Do you know that they have
a different stamp

35:16.680 --> 35:19.149
for every animal?

35:19.200 --> 35:20.953
Yeah.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.152
I'll always remember
going into his study

35:24.200 --> 35:26.840
where he kept his library
of stamp books.

35:26.880 --> 35:30.999
The place was covered with ash
because he smoked all the time.

35:31.040 --> 35:32.872
But we would sit in there,

35:32.920 --> 35:35.833
and we would write down all the
catalog numbers of the stamps

35:35.880 --> 35:37.678
that we wanted to
to mail away for.

35:37.720 --> 35:41.396
And I used to love
watching him open the envelopes

35:41.440 --> 35:43.352
when they arrived

35:43.400 --> 35:46.393
because they always were
exactly the same,

35:46.440 --> 35:49.274
in these brown wax envelopes

35:49.320 --> 35:51.391
with the exact
same handwriting...

35:51.440 --> 35:55.673
Philip Caruso
from Appleton, Wisconsin.

35:55.720 --> 36:01.398
But you never knew what stamp
was gonna be inside, you know?

36:01.440 --> 36:04.638
So it was...
it was really exciting.

36:06.240 --> 36:08.072
Yeah.

36:08.120 --> 36:11.875
And then he would separate all
his from the ocean-life stamps,

36:11.920 --> 36:13.957
and then he would
give those to me,

36:14.000 --> 36:17.755
and he would explain their Latin
names and where they came from.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.717
His hands used to shake.

36:25.080 --> 36:30.075
You could see it
when he was mounting the stamps

36:30.120 --> 36:33.796
under the magnifying glass,
you know?

36:33.840 --> 36:36.480
Or you could see it
in his handwriting.

36:36.520 --> 36:39.399
Or you'd hear it
in the ice in his whiskey.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.076
But you would like him, though.

36:46.200 --> 36:49.557
And he would like you.
He would.

36:49.600 --> 36:53.116
Do you think that you would like
to collect stamps? Hmm?

36:55.120 --> 36:58.875
I wonder
what your favorite animal is.

it's mandatory for both the LAPD

Both have been notified
and should be here shortly.

39:44.240 --> 39:46.914
But I'm also going to have to

But the authorities

39:56.800 --> 39:58.837

Child and Family Services

39:58.880 --> 40:00.519

40:10.840 --> 40:13.196

It's... It's just...
It's your walrus.

40:45.080 --> 40:47.151
Do you want your walrus?

40:48.840 --> 40:50.638
I know.

40:53.240 --> 40:54.594
I'll take this.

40:54.680 --> 40:57.878
Oh!
Shh, shh, shh.

40:57.920 --> 41:00.992
- Yeah.
- Bye, Ella.

41:03.360 --> 41:06.114
I'm Officer Cato.
This is Mrs. Deeks from DCFS.

41:06.160 --> 41:09.676
We need to ask you
some questions.

41:09.720 --> 41:11.951
- Okay.
- All right.

41:12.000 --> 41:16.392
Um, where did you say
you found the child?

41:16.440 --> 41:18.033
Dumpster.

41:18.120 --> 41:20.351
A lot of dumpsters out there.
Any one in particular?

41:22.520 --> 41:27.675
Um, the one by where I work.
In the back.

41:27.720 --> 41:32.670
And what time did you say
you found her this morning?

41:32.760 --> 41:34.513
Um...

41:36.840 --> 41:39.958
It was...
I don't remember.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.116
Early.

41:41.160 --> 41:42.879
Okay.

41:42.920 --> 41:46.436
Can you, um,
walk us through the event?

41:52.720 --> 41:55.633
I know this must be hard for
you, Mister, uh, Millings,

41:55.680 --> 41:59.754
but we need you to be very
specific about what happened.

41:59.800 --> 42:01.837
How did you know
she was in the dumpster?

42:04.880 --> 42:07.076
'Cause I heard her.

42:07.120 --> 42:08.679
You heard her crying?

42:11.880 --> 42:13.200
And then?

42:14.560 --> 42:16.791
And then...

42:18.400 --> 42:23.953
I heard her crying,
and I opened the dumpster,

42:24.000 --> 42:26.515
and I...

42:26.560 --> 42:30.554
I looked in, um...

42:32.800 --> 42:34.029
Mr. Millings...

42:36.280 --> 42:38.431
It's perfectly normal
for an experience like this

42:38.480 --> 42:39.834
to be traumatic.

42:39.880 --> 42:42.156
And not just for her
but for you as well.

42:42.200 --> 42:43.998
You're both victims.

42:45.520 --> 42:48.797
It's okay.
Just tell us what you remember.

42:53.160 --> 42:55.914
You, um...
You called her Ella.

42:55.960 --> 42:58.919
How did you know her name?
Or is that a name you gave her?

43:01.400 --> 43:05.599
She was in... in...
in the bag, in... in this bag,

43:05.640 --> 43:07.199
and there was a note.

43:07.240 --> 43:10.199
Okay, good.
What did the note say?

43:11.800 --> 43:13.951
It said,
"Her name was Ella."

43:15.560 --> 43:17.279
And where's the note?

43:24.360 --> 43:26.556
I don't know.

43:26.600 --> 43:28.353
I...

43:30.400 --> 43:32.437
- It's okay.
- I think I lost it.

43:35.040 --> 43:37.509
Is there a number I can
reach you at, Mr. Millings?

43:39.400 --> 43:43.758
You can come
to my place if you want.

43:46.680 --> 43:48.990
Can you, um, write down
that information

43:49.040 --> 43:50.713
along with your name
and address?

43:53.760 --> 43:56.719
Do you think that, uh...

43:56.760 --> 43:58.513
Do you think Ella
is gonna be okay?

43:58.560 --> 43:59.789
- Yes.
- Yeah?

43:59.840 --> 44:02.674
Yes, Ella will be
very well taken care of.

44:02.720 --> 44:03.995
I promise.

44:04.040 --> 44:05.633
She's a ward of the state now

44:05.680 --> 44:07.616
within the Department of
Children and Family Services,

44:07.640 --> 44:09.996
and we'll do our best to track
down someone in her family.

44:10.040 --> 44:12.600
But if not, she'll be placed
in proper foster care

44:12.640 --> 44:14.597
and then adoption.

44:14.640 --> 44:19.192
It's a bit of a process
unfortunately, but...

44:19.240 --> 44:21.357
Well, I could take care of her,
you know?

44:21.400 --> 44:24.711
I mean, I could...
I could adopt her.

44:24.760 --> 44:25.876
I mean...

44:28.960 --> 44:31.236
That is
incredibly sweet of you.

44:31.280 --> 44:34.159
Unfortunately, that's out of
my power or jurisdiction

44:34.200 --> 44:38.797
to decide whether or not you
qualify to foster this child.

44:38.840 --> 44:42.231
But I understand the urge
to want to help. I do.

44:42.280 --> 44:44.272
And you can help us
by giving us

44:44.320 --> 44:46.880
all the information
you have now.

44:46.920 --> 44:49.276
If anything comes to you,

44:49.320 --> 44:51.312
please feel free
to call me, okay?

44:53.400 --> 44:54.675
Okay.

45:46.920 --> 45:49.196
Russ.
Russ!

45:49.240 --> 45:50.276
Huh?

45:50.320 --> 45:53.074
Um, they want to talk to you.

45:55.280 --> 45:59.069
Hey, you mind stepping out and
chatting with us for a second?

45:59.520 --> 46:01.079
It's okay.
We don't bite.

46:05.400 --> 46:10.191
So, uh, the report says that you
found the baby in a dumpster.

46:13.640 --> 46:16.280
- The dumpster here at work?
- Yeah, that one.

46:19.040 --> 46:21.271
Okay, and in your statement,
it says that this incident

46:21.320 --> 46:24.074
occurred yesterday morning.

46:30.800 --> 46:34.032
Okay, Mr. Millings, do you mind
taking us over to that dumpster?

46:39.800 --> 46:43.237
You just found her in a gym bag
with a note, nothing else?

46:43.320 --> 46:45.357
What about that walrus,
though?

46:47.600 --> 46:49.080
We checked
with your management,

46:49.120 --> 46:51.680
and they say you didn't work
yesterday morning.

46:51.720 --> 46:55.077
In fact, they say you haven't
worked since Wednesday night.

46:56.680 --> 46:58.956
What you been doing since then,
Mr. Millings?

47:02.560 --> 47:04.119
We know about your record.

47:04.160 --> 47:05.514
You're still a parolee

47:05.560 --> 47:06.896
in the good state of California,
aren't you?

47:06.920 --> 47:08.056
Bet you're
counting the days

47:08.080 --> 47:10.117
till you can leave the state.

47:10.160 --> 47:13.676
Hey, um, can I get
that key back?

47:14.400 --> 47:16.416
You weren't here on Friday.
It's last week's paycheck.

47:16.440 --> 47:17.656
And I'm gonna have to call
the higher-ups

47:17.680 --> 47:18.830
about this whole baby thing.

47:18.880 --> 47:21.793
So you being
an ex-con and all,

47:21.840 --> 47:23.240
they're gonna want to know.

47:25.880 --> 47:27.109
See, my partner and I,

47:27.160 --> 47:28.514
we don't think
you found her here.

47:28.560 --> 47:30.199
We think you found her
somewhere else.

47:30.240 --> 47:31.976
We also don't think
you found her yesterday.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.959
You do know you can't take home
abandoned children, right?

47:35.000 --> 47:37.834
We know about your record.

47:37.880 --> 47:40.395
20 years in Folsom.

47:40.440 --> 47:42.136
Hell, you're still a parolee
in the good state

47:42.160 --> 47:43.674
of California, aren't you?

47:43.720 --> 47:45.757
But you're not
going anywhere, right?

48:00.320 --> 48:03.119
Have a good one.
Next.

48:09.520 --> 48:12.274
Do you have a bus to Wyoming?

48:12.320 --> 48:14.039
Okay, sir.

48:14.080 --> 48:15.719
Where in Wyoming
would you like to go?

48:15.760 --> 48:19.834
112 Trigood Avenue, Casper,
Wyoming 82602.

48:19.880 --> 48:21.758
Well, all right.

48:21.800 --> 48:24.235
Is that, uh,
round trip or one way?

48:24.280 --> 48:26.840
Uh, one way.

48:26.880 --> 48:30.271
And when
do you plan on leaving?

48:30.320 --> 48:31.356
Now.

50:22.200 --> 50:24.317
Denver.

50:24.360 --> 50:26.238
Just give me a second.

50:31.440 --> 50:33.671
I just had it.
I literally just had it.

50:36.200 --> 50:39.079
Just put my suitcase
on the bus while I find it.

50:39.120 --> 50:40.440
I know I just had it.

50:40.480 --> 50:41.976
I can't let you on
without a ticket.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.071
No, I know that!
I just...

50:44.120 --> 50:46.077
I mean, I just had it!

50:46.120 --> 50:48.351
Where...

50:48.440 --> 50:53.037
What the fuck?!
Ugh!

50:53.080 --> 50:54.992
Ticket or no,
you can't come on the bus

50:55.040 --> 50:56.474
if you're gonna be
a disturbance.

50:56.520 --> 50:58.398
I'm not...

50:58.440 --> 50:59.999
She's stressed out.

51:00.040 --> 51:03.158
I'm not gonna disturb anyone.
If you could just...

51:03.200 --> 51:05.157
Could it be in your pocket?

51:05.200 --> 51:07.271
No, it is not in my pocket!

51:13.080 --> 51:14.673
Thank you.

51:15.720 --> 51:17.996
I'll push your bag for you.

52:03.440 --> 52:04.874
Can I fucking help you?

52:55.440 --> 52:56.999
$9.75.

52:57.640 --> 53:00.633
Oh. Um...

53:00.680 --> 53:03.798
W-What about no chips?

53:06.440 --> 53:07.556
$6.95.

53:07.600 --> 53:09.114
Yeah. Yeah.

53:19.520 --> 53:21.079
Thank you.

53:25.560 --> 53:27.153
I'll put them back.

53:37.240 --> 53:40.233
You're welcome.
Don't choke.

53:43.960 --> 53:45.110
Thank you.

53:48.440 --> 53:50.716
Champ, you didn't listen.

53:50.760 --> 53:52.638
Oh, my God.

53:54.120 --> 53:56.157
Have some of your...
your drink.

53:56.200 --> 53:58.999
Um, I am.

53:59.040 --> 54:00.315
Is that better?

54:00.360 --> 54:01.396
Mm-hmm.

54:04.040 --> 54:05.156
Don't die on me.

54:11.360 --> 54:12.476
I'm okay.

54:35.200 --> 54:36.953
Would you like a sandwich?

54:37.000 --> 54:38.150
What?

54:40.920 --> 54:43.196
What kind of sandwich?

54:43.240 --> 54:45.880
Mm, mustard and mayo.

54:47.600 --> 54:50.957
You're gonna make me a mustard
and mayonnaise sandwich?

54:51.000 --> 54:53.071
Mm-hmm, i-if you want.
If you don't want...

54:53.120 --> 54:54.918
No, yeah, sure.

54:54.960 --> 54:56.553
Let's go, bro.

54:56.600 --> 54:58.637
Make me that mustard
and mayonnaise sandwich.

55:02.400 --> 55:03.993
Okay.

55:25.080 --> 55:26.639
Wait, can you
cut the crusts off?

55:26.680 --> 55:28.120
- Mm-hmm.
- No, I'm fucking with you.

55:28.160 --> 55:29.833
I'm kidding.

55:29.880 --> 55:31.519
No, it looks...
it looks amazing.

55:31.560 --> 55:33.631
That's...

55:33.680 --> 55:34.909
Okay.

Go.

Go.
Come on. You.

57:14.760 --> 57:16.353
Well, I said
my name is Russell.

57:16.400 --> 57:19.996
Yeah, I go... Hi, Russ.
I got that. Okay.

57:20.080 --> 57:21.799
What else?

57:21.840 --> 57:23.194
You're making me forget.

57:23.240 --> 57:24.993
What? Russ!
Come on.

57:25.040 --> 57:27.475
Before these mountains,
like, devour us

57:27.520 --> 57:30.592
and we never
see each other again.

57:30.640 --> 57:33.439
Hmm.
Yeah.

57:33.480 --> 57:35.199
Um...

57:35.240 --> 57:38.039
- Where are you from?
- Well, Casper, Wyoming.

57:38.080 --> 57:39.833
No.
No.

57:39.880 --> 57:42.349
Nobody is <i>from</i> Casper.

57:42.400 --> 57:44.198
- Oh, no, I...
- Pick another place. No.

57:44.240 --> 57:46.072
But, I mean, I am.
That... I'm...

57:46.120 --> 57:47.776
That's where I was born
if that's what you mean.

57:47.800 --> 57:49.757
Russ, I'm fucking with you.

57:49.800 --> 57:51.632
Oh.

57:51.680 --> 57:54.991
Okay, keep going,
Russ from Casper...

57:55.040 --> 57:57.953
the most boring-sounding place
there is... Wyoming.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.639
Well, it...

57:59.680 --> 58:01.876
I'm... I'm 44 years old.

58:01.920 --> 58:02.920
- 44?
- Mm-hmm.

58:02.960 --> 58:04.553
Like, "44."

58:04.600 --> 58:05.670
Yeah, I got you.
Okay.

58:05.720 --> 58:07.154
- I mean, that's old.
- Wait.

58:07.200 --> 58:09.431
Dude, like,
that's "dust in the wind" old.

58:11.400 --> 58:12.629
Okay, what else?

58:16.360 --> 58:18.192
I don't... I don't know.

58:18.240 --> 58:20.152
What's your favorite color?

58:23.000 --> 58:24.957
Red.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.674
Wow.
Okay.

58:27.720 --> 58:28.949
Didn't see that coming.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.434
Um...

58:30.480 --> 58:31.834
What's your favorite movie?

58:31.880 --> 58:36.159
Um, I... I liked "Predator"
a lot

58:36.240 --> 58:38.232
when I was young, you know?

58:40.040 --> 58:41.997
"Predator," like...

58:42.080 --> 58:45.915
Arnold, "Hasta la vista, baby"?

58:46.000 --> 58:47.229
- Oh, that's...
- Like that?

58:47.280 --> 58:48.794
No, that's "The Terminator,"
but yeah.

58:48.840 --> 58:51.560
Whatever! Oh, my God.
You suck at this.

58:53.120 --> 58:54.634
Okay.
Keep going.

58:54.680 --> 58:55.830
- With what?
- Come on.

58:55.880 --> 58:57.155
I don't... I don't...

58:57.200 --> 58:59.999
What else? What do you mean?
Like...

59:00.040 --> 59:01.554
What... What's your sign?

59:01.640 --> 59:04.599
- Oh, well, I'm Scorpio, I...
- No fucking...

59:04.640 --> 59:06.154
Ungh!

59:06.200 --> 59:09.113
No!

59:09.160 --> 59:12.153
- No.
- What?

59:12.200 --> 59:14.635
Jesus.
That takes care of that.

59:14.680 --> 59:16.717
Can't fucking talk to you.

59:38.040 --> 59:39.440
So stupid.

59:39.480 --> 59:41.870
All right, listen.
I'm kidding, okay?

59:41.920 --> 59:43.195
I'm just kidding.

59:43.240 --> 59:44.959
I mean,
I'm not kidding about,

59:45.000 --> 59:49.233
like, all the guys and my dad
all being Scorpios, but...

59:50.520 --> 59:52.989
...I will give you
another chance.

59:53.520 --> 59:54.670
Okay.

59:55.600 --> 59:57.831
Um...

59:57.880 --> 59:59.280
All right.
Okay.

59:59.320 --> 01:00:03.030
What's...
What's your last name?

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.153
Millings.

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.669
- Millings?
- Yeah.

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:11.758
- Russell Millings?
- Yeah. That's me.

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.393
Aw, Russell Millings.

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:15.159
- Mm-hmm.
- You got a middle name?

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.271
Yeah.

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:18.549
- Earl.
- Earl?

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.954
- Yeah.
- Earl?

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
- Yeah.
- For real? Earl?

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.440
Yeah.
Is that...

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:24.676
Russell Earl Millings.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:26.439
Well, I guess.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.597
- Wait, what?
- What?

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.176
'Cause now you
don't sound so sure about it.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:33.193
Oh, no, I'm sure.
I'm sure. That's me, yeah.

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:49.670
Do you have some more napkins?
I got to go to the bathroom.

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:52.589
Yeah.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.590
Sure.

01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.791
Thanks.
Okay, I'll be back.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:18.115
Union Station,
downtown Denver is next.

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:40.679
Well,
if you're ever in Denver,

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.359
go to Greenlock's.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:43.754
It's my brother's café,

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:47.396
and if I'm still there,
we can hang.

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:50.638
Yeah.
Greenlock's?

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:55.560
- Okay, um...
- Um...

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:01.880
Good luck with life...

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:05.150
...Russell Earl Millings.

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.391
Yeah, you too.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:09.000
- Excuse me.
- Oh. Uh...

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.679
So sorry.

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:11.836
Yeah.

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:17.000
Thank you for the mustard
and mayo sandwich, dude.

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.039
Yo, you've got to go.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.515
Ceremonies don't start
till 9:00.

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:50.350
Hi, Dad.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:51.993
Hey, Mom.

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.756
This is a nice spot.

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:18.999
Sorry it took me
so long to get here.

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:27.437
It hasn't gone
the way I thought... life.

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:36.757
Don't even know what I'm
doing with myself anymore.

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:54.880
I...

01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:56.912
I struggle with...

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:01.318
...myself so much, Mama.

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:12.560
I'm sorry, Dad.

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:18.154
Thank you for being
my parents.

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:02.479
How can I help you, sir?

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:05.160
I'm here to open
my safety deposit box.

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.510
Okay.
What's the number on the box?

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:14.558
Um, my dad, he gave me his keys
and told me to come here.

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:15.795
And who's your father?

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.877
David Earl Millings.

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:19.195
What's your name?

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.476
Russell.

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:25.637
And you say
that you're his son.

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:31.556
No, I didn't say I'm his son.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.831
I'm his son.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.037
Do you have an I.D.,
Mr. Millings?

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.711
- Just give me one sec.
- Okay.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.071
Hey, Jim, can I see you
for a second?

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:00.232
I think
there's a transient here.

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:03.114
Has the key to one of our boxes.
Last name Millings.

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:08.754
I'll get Joey
to get him out here.

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.076
I'll take care of it.
Thank you.

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:19.555
Here you go, Mr. Millings.

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.910
I'm Jim Pitt, manager here.

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:25.350
I am so sorry
for any misunderstandings.

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:35.834
We were wondering
when you were gonna stop by.

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:37.951
Your father, he was a...

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:42.759
Well, he was a client here
for many years.

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.359
Good man.

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.269
Do you know
what's in our box?

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:53.916
Right this way.

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:56.600
It's just back here.
Jeannie.

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:11.834
I'll give you
a few moments alone.

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:15.760
When you need me, I'll be
right outside, Mr. Millings.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:06.359
<i>Son, I can only imagine
the road that you've traveled.</i>

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:09.871
<i>I'm writing you
on New Year's Eve.</i>

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:13.118
<i>Tomorrow is a new millennium,
a new decade,</i>

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:17.313
<i>a new year, a new day.</i>

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.670
<i>Folks are saying it's all
coming to an end</i>

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:21.757
<i>with this Y2K shit,</i>

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:24.269
<i>but I don't believe it.</i>

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:28.200
<i>I think about
you a lot, Rusky.</i>

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:31.472
<i>I imagine you in that prison.</i>

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:36.356
<i>I try to take away
the world between us.</i>

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:42.073
<i>And then I try to take
away the walls that hold you.</i>

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:43.952
<i>And I see you...</i>

01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:47.474
<i>...asleep in your cell,</i>

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:52.356
<i>hovering in the dark air,
alone.</i>

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:55.552
<i>I call out your name
in the night.</i>

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:58.798
<i>You will only ever be
my boy...</i>

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.117
<i>...the guy I found
in your mother's arms</i>

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:06.913
<i>that November afternoon.</i>

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:09.873
<i>You were the happiest guy.</i>

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:14.233
<i>The guy who shared everything
with everyone.</i>

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:17.318
<i>The guy
who taught me how to love.</i>

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:19.829
<i>I love you, Russ.</i>

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:23.032
<i>So I'm giving them all
to you, Rusky.</i>

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:26.994
<i>The Tyrian plum alone should
get you back on your feet.</i>

01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:29.714
<i>And your other key
is to a storage unit</i>

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:30.989
<i>just down the street.</i>

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:32.952
<i>Keep them, sell them.</i>

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.119
<i>Just find your way, Russell.</i>

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:45.354
<i>It's a second chance
after such a bad hand.</i>

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:48.677
<i>Go see the world, son.</i>

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:50.916
<i>Don't look back, buddy.</i>

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:54.199
<i>Your mother used to say,</i>

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:55.833
<i>"Once in a while,
it hits people</i>

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:58.031
<i>that they don't
have to experience the world</i>

01:12:58.080 --> 01:12:59.992
<i>in the way
they have been told to."</i>

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:01.520
<i>Ha ha!</i>

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.916
<i>Smartest girl I ever met.</i>

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:08.599
<i>I love you, son.</i>

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:14.830
<i>That can't change the past,
but the past can't change that.</i>

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:19.272
<i>I love you like a wolf
loves the moon.</i>

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:25.000
<i>Welcome home. Dad.</i>

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:08.154
Hi, Mr. Millings.

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:09.919
Good to see you again.
How can I help you?

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:11.917
I was here
to check on Ella.

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:15.078
Yes, I did get
all of your e-mails.

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.759
Ella is doing great,

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:19.838
and we have yet to be contacted
by any of her relatives,

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:22.998
but she is thriving in
a temporary home right now.

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:27.278
Thanks.
That's... yeah.

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:32.070
I looked into
the adoption process.

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:33.270
- Yes.
- Remember...

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:34.959
Okay, listen.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.879
I'm gonna be completely frank
with you, Mr. Millings.

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:40.799
You are going to have
a tough go at it.

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:42.593
I'm not saying
it's impossible.

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:46.793
Do you know, I realize that's
unlikely, you know, that...

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:48.433
I mean, that's not
why I'm here.

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:51.552
I'm here
to give this to you.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.071
It's for Ella.

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:56.349
Okay?

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.960
And if you could
give it to her

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.596
on her 18th birthday, okay?

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:08.480
Wait, why her 18th birthday?

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:10.273
'Cause that's the way
the trust was set up.

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:11.640
That's what they said.

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:13.239
That way
it would be just for her,

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:15.198
and she would be ready.

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:18.114
Can you make sure
that she gets it?

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:19.554
- Yeah, o-of course.
- Okay.

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:21.239
I sent all this to you
in a e-mail

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:24.557
with information about the trust
and instructions.

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:28.833
And it's best if you leave
the envelope i-in the plastic.

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:30.997
It protects the stamps.

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.198
Oh... Thank you.

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:49.600
- Have a nice trip.
- Thank you.

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:51.074
Mm-hmm.

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:54.480
Next.

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.520
Where would
you like to go, sir?
