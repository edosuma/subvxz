00:36.717 --> 00:38.365
Ho, ho, ho, Lex.

00:38.711 --> 00:40.948
Any reason we couldn't have
met at the mansion?

00:41.096 --> 00:45.876
I don't make house calls.
You wanna utilize my skills,
you come to me.

00:46.045 --> 00:50.049
That is, if you really wanna
bring down Jonathan Kent.

00:51.147 --> 00:54.437
Then I'm assuming you have
some kind of grenade to launch at him.

00:55.791 --> 00:56.941
Not yet.

00:58.307 --> 00:59.619
But I will.

01:03.295 --> 01:06.650
I'll either find it or create it.

01:07.722 --> 01:10.185
It's the pitfall of being
in the public eye.

01:10.403 --> 01:13.154
See, what's printed
about a man is gospel.

01:13.312 --> 01:15.645
Doesn't matter if it's fact or not.

01:17.432 --> 01:19.416
Give me 24 hours.

01:23.561 --> 01:25.860
Your old man wouldn't hesitate.

01:28.705 --> 01:31.382
Before I go down the path
you're <i>proposing...</i>

01:31.508 --> 01:33.572
...I wanna consider all of my options.

01:34.853 --> 01:39.565
What's the matter, Lex?
Holiday spirit got you all sentimental?

01:43.407 --> 01:46.753
My father gets wind that we met...

01:46.940 --> 01:50.156
...you're not gonna make it
to New Year's, Griff.

02:01.779 --> 02:03.241
Well, well.

02:03.620 --> 02:06.549
Looks like Santa Claus
came to town after all.

02:07.555 --> 02:10.929
- I'm not looking for trouble.
- Come on, man, I ain't playing!

02:11.103 --> 02:13.399
- Give me your keys!
- All right, take it easy.

02:13.515 --> 02:14.940
Now!

02:15.441 --> 02:17.125
And the watch!

03:07.000 --> 03:08.550
Lana

03:10.000 --> 03:11.355
Breakfast!

03:11.356 --> 03:14.171
- Who are you?
- Honey, you promised him.

03:14.214 --> 03:16.997
- Come on.
- I don't remember. What hap...?

03:17.022 --> 03:18.471
- Come on, Dad!
- Pancakes.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.128
You promised Alex pancakes.

03:20.247 --> 03:22.158
And then you're gonna
go shopping for a tree.

03:22.295 --> 03:25.797
- No, don't. Don't complain to me.

03:25.845 --> 03:26.916
- Dad. Let's go.

03:27.031 --> 03:29.495
You're the one who always wants
to wait until Christmas Eve to get it.

03:31.313 --> 03:34.705
- Lana, you're...
- Alex, come on, let's get you dressed.

03:35.514 --> 03:36.381
- Okay.
- What the...?

03:36.509 --> 03:39.113
Me and Dad are gonna
get the best tree ever.

03:57.046 --> 03:58.690
What happened?

03:59.766 --> 04:01.584
Where am I?

04:18.012 --> 04:19.310
Hello, Lex.

04:21.099 --> 04:22.489
Mom?

04:25.598 --> 04:29.355
But you're...
- Am I dead?

04:29.473 --> 04:33.320
- No, Lex. You're still very much alive. 

04:34.895 --> 04:35.999
Then how is...?

04:37.318 --> 04:38.807
I'm dreaming.

04:45.002 --> 04:48.769
It's no dream, Lex. This is your life.

04:50.301 --> 04:52.427
But I don't understand. 

04:52.635 --> 04:54.616
<i>This...</i> This can't be... This isn't real.

04:54.623 --> 04:59.142
It is real, Lex.
As real as you want it to be.

04:59.202 --> 05:03.110
All of this can be yours,
if you make the right choices.

05:05.195 --> 05:06.782
All of this?

05:07.612 --> 05:12.147
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

06:20.688 --> 06:23.054
serves you right.
these are for the party.

06:23.088 --> 06:24.955
besides, we have
enough politicians

06:24.989 --> 06:26.855
with their hands
in the cookie jar.

06:26.889 --> 06:29.121
martha...look,
i know you're not sold

06:29.154 --> 06:32.021
on the whole idea
of me running for state senate.

06:32.054 --> 06:34.388
"not sold" would be
an understatement.

06:34.421 --> 06:36.922
but it is christmas eve.
see?

06:38.355 --> 06:41.855
can we please not talk
about that?

06:43.121 --> 06:45.788
please?
come on, please?

06:45.822 --> 06:47.121
please?

06:47.154 --> 06:48.555
hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey!

06:48.588 --> 06:50.088
just one.
you cheater.

06:53.088 --> 06:55.855
there.
she's perfect.

06:55.889 --> 06:57.488
yes, she is.

07:04.188 --> 07:07.355
it's usually just me and mel
at christmas,

07:07.388 --> 07:10.321
lots of tinsel,
and an artificial tree.

07:12.622 --> 07:14.855
thank you, clark,
for saving me

07:14.889 --> 07:16.688
from anothlastic,
store-bought holiday.

07:16.722 --> 07:18.255
you're welcome.

07:27.288 --> 07:30.555
merry christmas, chloe.

07:30.588 --> 07:32.154
hi, chloe.

07:32.188 --> 07:34.288
clark,
i've got a problem.

07:34.321 --> 07:35.855
meet me at <i>the planet.</i>

07:35.889 --> 07:38.154
i need your help.

07:44.121 --> 07:46.388
mr. luthor,
can you hear me?

07:46.421 --> 07:49.455
mr. luthor, squeeze my hand
if you can hear me.

08:01.021 --> 08:02.688
lana:
alexander, hey!

08:02.722 --> 08:05.188
hey,
wait for your father.

08:05.221 --> 08:07.154
come on!

08:12.455 --> 08:14.288
try and be back by 6:00

08:14.321 --> 08:16.288
so we can make it
to the kents' party.

08:16.321 --> 08:19.021
kents?

08:19.054 --> 08:20.755
[ chuckles ]
and this year,

08:20.788 --> 08:22.054
try and remember
that we're on a budget.

08:22.088 --> 08:24.688
at?

08:24.722 --> 08:26.555
w-we have a budget?

08:26.588 --> 08:28.255
lex, it's been
seven years

08:28.288 --> 08:30.388
since your father cut up
your platinum card.

08:30.421 --> 08:32.587
i think it's time to embrace
the middle-class lifestyle.

08:32.621 --> 08:34.355
daddy, daddy,
let's go, let's go.

08:34.388 --> 08:35.889
seven years?

08:37.621 --> 08:38.922
seven years?

08:44.555 --> 08:46.021
let me see.

08:46.054 --> 08:48.255
okay, here. you know what?
let me do that, lex.

08:48.288 --> 08:49.688
come here.
[ laughs ]

08:49.722 --> 08:51.221
come on.

08:51.255 --> 08:54.054
one of these days, you're gonna
figure out how to do this,

08:54.088 --> 08:56.622
and hopefully it's before
your new little girl arrives.

08:56.655 --> 08:59.555
alex, in you go.

09:02.688 --> 09:05.455
i'm sorry
about the whole budget thing.

09:05.488 --> 09:07.722
i know
that you only overspend

09:07.755 --> 09:10.188
because you want
the best for us,

09:10.221 --> 09:13.121
and that's part
of why i love you so much.

09:25.688 --> 09:29.388
have fun.
[ laughs ]

10:09.755 --> 10:12.055
wow!

10:12.088 --> 10:13.621
wow is right,

10:13.654 --> 10:15.855
but lana said --

10:15.888 --> 10:18.355
your mom said --

10:18.389 --> 10:19.788
clark?

10:19.821 --> 10:21.755
hey.

10:21.788 --> 10:25.588
oh, you have no idea how happy
i am to see the two of you.

10:25.621 --> 10:27.888
are you a father again?

10:27.921 --> 10:30.122
uh...

10:30.155 --> 10:31.888
no.

10:31.921 --> 10:33.921
not yet.

10:33.955 --> 10:35.222
i was just --

10:35.255 --> 10:37.222
uncle clark, uncle clark,
make me fly!

10:37.255 --> 10:38.688
hey!

10:38.721 --> 10:40.688
hey, i missed you,
little guy.

10:40.721 --> 10:42.088
come on.
whoosh!

10:43.788 --> 10:46.489
i'm sorry i haven't
been around lately.

10:46.521 --> 10:49.088
things have been crazy
at <i>the planet.</i>

10:49.122 --> 10:51.422
yeah, don't let his "things
have been crazy" line fool you.

10:51.455 --> 10:53.088
he's been promoted.

10:53.122 --> 10:55.188
yeah, now i'm closer to being
a full-fledged reporter.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.788
i've got some
pretty big news, too.

10:57.821 --> 10:58.955
okay.

10:58.988 --> 11:01.322
my book's being published
in january.

11:01.355 --> 11:03.788
wow. that's great.

11:03.821 --> 11:06.455
yeah, they love the idea
of a luthorcorp expos?

11:06.489 --> 11:08.688
complete with an anonymous
tell-all source.

11:08.721 --> 11:12.455
thank you so much.

11:12.489 --> 11:14.455
i couldn't have done it
without you, lex.

11:15.988 --> 11:17.521
all right,

11:17.554 --> 11:20.055
miss "did i mention my book
is about to be published?"

11:20.088 --> 11:22.155
let's get your tree
and get out of here.

11:22.188 --> 11:24.188
okay. bye, alex.
bye, lex.

11:24.222 --> 11:25.654
see ya, lex.

11:25.688 --> 11:27.489
see you tonight.

11:27.521 --> 11:29.688
alex: dad!

11:32.688 --> 11:34.788
this one's awesome!

11:49.888 --> 11:52.988
what happened?

11:53.022 --> 11:55.122
what's wrong with my son?

11:55.155 --> 11:56.455
nurse: just a minute.

11:56.489 --> 11:57.988
where's the doctor?

11:58.022 --> 12:00.255
mr. luthor,
i'm dr. scanlon.

12:00.288 --> 12:02.422
what's hpening,
doctor?

12:02.455 --> 12:04.122
your son's been shot.

12:07.088 --> 12:08.955
shot?

12:08.988 --> 12:12.489
fortunately, his life is
no longer in danger.

12:12.521 --> 12:16.222
i'm afraid lex is going to be
permanently paralyzed

12:16.255 --> 12:17.755
from the chest down.

12:17.788 --> 12:21.654
your son's internal bleeding
created a blood clot

12:21.688 --> 12:24.355
that's slowly compressing
his spinal cord.

12:24.389 --> 12:27.255
if we could relieve
the pressure, we might --

12:27.288 --> 12:28.621
if?

12:28.654 --> 12:30.489
no.

12:30.521 --> 12:34.855
no, we are going to do it,
doctor...

12:34.888 --> 12:36.188
now.

12:36.222 --> 12:38.122
mr. luthor,
lex hasn't stabilized yet.

12:38.155 --> 12:39.621
an operation
could kill him.

12:39.654 --> 12:44.255
my son is going to walk,
doctor.

12:44.288 --> 12:46.955
get me dr. litvack.

12:46.988 --> 12:49.122
chloe: so, then they put me
in charge,

12:49.155 --> 12:51.788
and i've actually gotten
a really great response.

12:51.821 --> 12:54.489
i mean, i have doubled
the number of toys for tots

12:54.521 --> 12:56.322
 <i>the planet</i> collected
last year.

12:56.355 --> 12:58.055
okay,
so what's the problem?

12:58.088 --> 13:00.355
well, the presents
need to be delivered tonight

13:00.389 --> 13:02.855
and the teamsters are on strike
on christmas eve.

13:02.888 --> 13:05.155
so, instead of calling fedex,
you called me?

13:05.188 --> 13:06.988
i do realize
it's a lot to ask,

13:07.022 --> 13:09.821
but, i mean, you do run faster
than a speeding bullet

13:09.855 --> 13:12.022
and i know you don't
want to disappoint

13:12.055 --> 13:14.422
all those underprivileged
children, do you?

13:14.455 --> 13:16.255
chloe,
you didn't have to go there.

13:16.288 --> 13:17.955
well, you know it's true.

13:17.988 --> 13:20.122
i mean, you'd be helping out
a really great cause,

13:20.155 --> 13:21.888
not to mention
saving my career.

13:21.921 --> 13:23.554
it's just,
i promised lana --

13:23.588 --> 13:25.088
i'm sure
she'll understand.

13:25.122 --> 13:26.755
or at least
she'll understand

13:26.788 --> 13:29.422
whatever it is
you make up to tell her.

13:29.455 --> 13:30.621
please?

13:31.988 --> 13:33.389
all right.

13:33.422 --> 13:35.654
yay!
i'll deliver a few
on my way to the party.

13:35.688 --> 13:38.654
you're my hero.
i knew you'd come through.

13:38.688 --> 13:39.821
okay.

13:44.755 --> 13:47.788
chloe, this isn't
toys for tots.

13:47.821 --> 13:50.222
it's toys "r" us.
how many are there?

13:50.255 --> 13:52.855
uh, a couple thousand,
give or take.

13:52.888 --> 13:54.688
now, i mapquested
these addresses.

13:54.721 --> 13:57.355
and the sooner you can
get started, the better.

13:57.389 --> 13:59.788
here comes santa claus.

14:43.122 --> 14:46.489
you're not santa claus.

14:46.521 --> 14:48.888
yes, i am.
i'm, uh...

14:54.821 --> 14:57.255
...i'm the new,
improved model.

14:57.288 --> 15:00.188
liar. you can't be santa.
 <i>he</i> is.

15:21.988 --> 15:23.788
clark:
are you all right?

15:23.821 --> 15:26.788
you're a little close
to the edge, aren't you?

15:26.821 --> 15:30.088
makes it easier to jump.

15:34.255 --> 15:36.988
yeah, i guess it does,
doesn't it?

15:40.922 --> 15:42.521
mind if i sit?

15:42.555 --> 15:44.521
it's a free whatever.

15:44.555 --> 15:46.555
you want a drink?

15:46.588 --> 15:49.454
no, thanks.
i'm good.

15:51.721 --> 15:54.855
w-why don't you
have a seat?

15:54.888 --> 15:57.321
you can always jump later.

15:57.354 --> 15:59.289
yeah,
i guess you're right.

16:00.788 --> 16:03.454
after all...

16:03.488 --> 16:06.488
it's not like
i've got somewhere to be.

16:11.955 --> 16:14.588
listen, i don't want to
be nosy, but...

16:18.055 --> 16:22.855
...i was just wondering,
santa...

16:22.888 --> 16:25.289
what are you doing
up here?

16:25.321 --> 16:28.388
i mean,
why are you gonna jump?

16:32.055 --> 16:34.388
give me one good reason
why i shouldn't.

16:34.421 --> 16:35.988
you can't, can you?

16:38.289 --> 16:41.289
have you had a good look
at the world lately?

16:43.354 --> 16:46.321
it's all take, take, take,
bitch, bitch, bitch.

16:49.122 --> 16:52.621
what happened
to christmas?

16:52.655 --> 16:56.588
peace on earth?

16:56.621 --> 16:58.955
good will to men?

16:58.988 --> 17:02.222
i'll tell you something.

17:06.721 --> 17:10.954
the spirit of christmas
is dead.

17:14.588 --> 17:17.255
and it's gonna take
a lot more than santa claus

17:17.289 --> 17:18.721
to revive it.

17:34.922 --> 17:36.488
increase his liquids

17:36.521 --> 17:39.855
and, uh, give him 8 milligrams
of decadron.

17:39.888 --> 17:42.888
the only thing you have to give
my son, dr. scanlon,

17:42.922 --> 17:45.721
is whatever is medically
necessary to have him moved.

17:45.755 --> 17:47.155
i am having lex airlifted

17:47.189 --> 17:49.122
to the davis clinic
in metropolis

17:49.155 --> 17:50.555
for immediate surgery.

17:50.588 --> 17:52.421
their neurosurgeon
is standing by.

17:52.454 --> 17:54.655
mr. luthor,
i can't condone this.

17:54.688 --> 17:58.788
luckily, doctor,
you don't have to.

17:58.822 --> 18:01.055
listen to me.

18:01.088 --> 18:04.621
you are going to walk, son.

18:28.855 --> 18:30.521
mommy, come see.

18:30.555 --> 18:33.354
it's a beauty,
isn't it, dad?

18:43.655 --> 18:45.488
i know
what you're thinking.

18:45.521 --> 18:48.388
that you've given in
to your son again,

18:48.421 --> 18:50.222
that you're spoiling him?

18:50.255 --> 18:51.755
exactly.

18:51.788 --> 18:54.354
and i can certainly understand
how you reach that conclusion,

18:54.388 --> 18:56.955
but...the thing is...

18:58.354 --> 19:00.454
...this tree is for me.

19:00.488 --> 19:03.788
i don't know
if i ever told you this,

19:03.822 --> 19:07.122
but after my mother died...

19:07.155 --> 19:11.688
my father didn't allow christmas
to be celebrated in our house.

19:11.721 --> 19:15.621
it was a very bleak,
very lonely time for me.

19:17.155 --> 19:20.521
and when i saw this tree

19:20.555 --> 19:23.289
and it was exactly like the ones
i dreamed about

19:23.321 --> 19:26.255
all the years
i couldn't have one,

19:26.289 --> 19:30.421
somehow it represented
all the christmases i missed.

19:36.388 --> 19:38.788
can you understand that?

19:38.822 --> 19:42.321
of course i can, honey.

19:42.354 --> 19:45.688
it's the same thing
that you tell me every year.

20:00.755 --> 20:03.055
all right, let me get something
to put on the floor

20:03.088 --> 20:04.755
before you get needles
everywhere.

20:04.788 --> 20:06.255
come on, muscles.

20:06.289 --> 20:08.255
do i have to do this
all myself?

20:13.155 --> 20:16.255
hey. what's this?

20:18.421 --> 20:21.354
your father's secretary
never does forget us.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.421
no, this is
a corporate gift,

20:23.454 --> 20:25.521
not something
from my father.

20:25.555 --> 20:27.721
i don't understand.

20:27.755 --> 20:29.655
lex, you know
that christmas

20:29.688 --> 20:32.822
is just another opportunity
for your father to ignore you.

20:32.855 --> 20:34.755
it's his way
of reminding you

20:34.788 --> 20:36.922
just how disappointed
he is in you

20:36.955 --> 20:38.421
for turning your back

20:38.454 --> 20:40.855
on what he thinks it means
to be a luthor.

20:40.888 --> 20:44.688
but as far
as i'm concerned...

20:46.755 --> 20:51.621
...getting shot was the best
thing that ever happened to you.

20:51.655 --> 20:53.555
coming that close
to dying

20:53.588 --> 20:56.222
made you realize the things
in your life that are important,

20:56.255 --> 21:00.289
made you the man
that you are today...

21:00.321 --> 21:02.088
the man i married.

21:08.521 --> 21:10.855
man: medevac standing by.
please proceed with patient.

21:10.888 --> 21:12.354
over and out.

21:12.388 --> 21:13.988
man #2: roger that.

21:14.022 --> 21:16.555
santa: now, let me
get this straight.

21:16.588 --> 21:19.255
you gave up
your first christmas

21:19.289 --> 21:21.655
with the girl
you have loved

21:21.688 --> 21:25.521
since you spied on her
through your telescope

21:25.555 --> 21:30.189
to deliver these?

21:30.222 --> 21:31.621
yeah.

21:31.655 --> 21:34.354
i mean, well,
i wasn't spying on her.

21:37.855 --> 21:39.822
look,
i wasn't the only one.

21:39.855 --> 21:42.655
my friend chloe,
she gave up her plans, too.

21:42.688 --> 21:44.721
i mean,
someone had to do it.

21:44.755 --> 21:47.621
otherwise those kids wouldn't
have gotten their presents.

21:47.655 --> 21:49.721
they're the ones
o really need them.

21:49.755 --> 21:54.688
so, the two of you decided
to try and play santa claus?

21:57.888 --> 22:00.354
i guess i was wrong.

22:01.788 --> 22:04.621
the spirit of christmas
isn't dead, after all.

22:11.955 --> 22:14.122
you sure
you're all right?

22:14.155 --> 22:17.888
i ???

22:35.255 --> 22:37.488
ho, ho, holy cow.

22:37.521 --> 22:39.354
merry christmas.

22:47.981 --> 22:50.048
we'll begin by collapsing
the left lung,

22:50.081 --> 22:52.014
ed by
a left-sided thoracotomy.

22:52.048 --> 22:53.849
merry christmas,
everyone.

22:53.881 --> 22:57.148
now, kill the carols.
i'm about to perform a miracle.

23:00.148 --> 23:03.148
the party can officially begin.
the luthors are here.

23:03.181 --> 23:04.415
merry christmas, lana.

23:04.448 --> 23:05.715
merry christmas, clark.

23:05.749 --> 23:08.281
lex, merry christmas.

23:08.315 --> 23:09.448
hey.

23:22.048 --> 23:25.181
lex. just the man
i've been waiting for.

23:25.215 --> 23:27.482
lana,
naeautiful.

23:27.515 --> 23:28.582
thank you.

23:28.615 --> 23:30.348
and just about due,
i might add.

23:30.382 --> 23:32.348
only a few more weeks now,
senator.

23:32.382 --> 23:35.248
martha: merry christmas, lana.
you look so beautiful.

23:35.281 --> 23:38.648
lex, merry christmas.
[ chuckles ]

23:41.382 --> 23:44.281
look, i probably shouldn't be
showing you this,

23:44.315 --> 23:47.448
but being a state senator
does have its advantages,

23:47.482 --> 23:50.415
like a little advance notice
from the governor.

23:59.081 --> 24:03.782
lex, i never actually thought
i'd say this.

24:03.815 --> 24:06.648
i couldn't be prouder of you
if you were my own son.

24:09.548 --> 24:13.348
mr. kent --
jonathan --

24:13.382 --> 24:15.415
i don't know what to say.

24:15.448 --> 24:18.014
let's tell everybody,
shall we? hmm?

24:18.048 --> 24:19.181
come on.

24:19.215 --> 24:21.782
everybody, grab a drink.

24:21.815 --> 24:24.715
come on, grab a glass.
listen up.

24:24.749 --> 24:27.448
here, here, please.
thank you.

24:28.914 --> 24:30.582
now, uh...

24:30.615 --> 24:33.448
ladies and gentlemen,
i have it on very good authority

24:33.482 --> 24:36.548
that this year's
kansas humanitarian award

24:36.582 --> 24:40.715
is going to be given
to our very own lex luthor.

24:42.248 --> 24:46.782
ladies and gentlemen,
i give you lex luthor,

24:46.815 --> 24:50.248
the finest man i know.

24:50.281 --> 24:51.615
cheers!cheers!
cheers!cheers!

24:56.181 --> 25:01.148
lex: i can't remember
ever being this happy.

25:01.181 --> 25:04.081
this has been
the best day of my life.

25:04.115 --> 25:06.914
thank you.

25:06.948 --> 25:09.148
it doesn't have to end,
lex.

25:09.181 --> 25:11.648
every day
can be this wonderful.

25:11.648 --> 25:14.715
i told you this is the life
you could have,d 

25:14.749 --> 25:16.849
the life
you <i>can</i> have, lex.

25:16.881 --> 25:19.048
this is what i want.

25:19.081 --> 25:21.315
what do i have to do?

25:21.348 --> 25:24.148
you just have to make
the right decision, lex.

25:24.181 --> 25:26.548
follow your heart,
not your ambition.

25:26.582 --> 25:29.782
what decision?
what are you talking about?

25:29.815 --> 25:34.548
lex...
who are you talking to?

25:38.515 --> 25:43.248
no one...
or possibly myself.

25:43.281 --> 25:46.215
i really don't know
anymore.

25:46.248 --> 25:48.715
i guess i'm just feeling
contemplative this evening.

25:48.749 --> 25:51.648
yeah, well, the holidays
will do that to you.

25:56.348 --> 25:59.382
you know, my life hasn't turned
out at all the way i planned.

26:01.148 --> 26:03.382
and yet,
i've never been happier.

26:03.415 --> 26:05.749
lex, you have
a wonderful life

26:05.782 --> 26:08.081
and every reason
to be happy.

26:08.115 --> 26:12.048
you have a beautiful wife,
great son,

26:12.081 --> 26:14.014
a baby on the way.

26:14.048 --> 26:17.248
something i still
can't quite believe --

26:17.281 --> 26:19.415
me and lana.

26:19.448 --> 26:21.914
now, how the hell
did that happen?

26:21.948 --> 26:24.682
well...

26:24.715 --> 26:27.548
you became the kind of man
she could love.

26:27.582 --> 26:30.749
you mean the kind of man
you've always been?

26:34.014 --> 26:37.248
and, lex, you offered her
something i didn't.

26:37.281 --> 26:41.315
what held you back,
clark?

26:41.348 --> 26:43.382
i mean,
i know you love her --

26:45.215 --> 26:47.181
i don't know.

26:47.215 --> 26:49.382
i guess
i just wasn't ready, lex.

26:49.415 --> 26:51.181
maybe i never will be.

26:51.215 --> 26:55.048
but i am glad that you and lana
ended up together

26:55.081 --> 26:58.881
and we've been able to remain
such good friends.

27:01.081 --> 27:02.148
thank you.

27:02.181 --> 27:05.448
lex, come quickly.
it's lana.

27:11.415 --> 27:13.648
suction.

27:13.682 --> 27:16.415
yeah,
i need more suction.

27:16.448 --> 27:19.582
and give me
some more exposure.

27:21.715 --> 27:24.081
we're ng him.

27:24.115 --> 27:25.881
come on, people,
get it together.

27:30.981 --> 27:32.815
you were great.

27:37.482 --> 27:39.248
merry christmas.

27:39.281 --> 27:42.914
you're the parents
of a beautiful baby girl.

27:45.014 --> 27:46.582
wow.

27:48.315 --> 27:50.248
she's perfect.

27:52.782 --> 27:54.749
what an amazing
christmas gift, lana.

27:54.782 --> 27:56.014
thank you.

27:58.181 --> 28:00.615
well,
you did a little bit.

28:02.014 --> 28:05.215
hi.
hi, little girl.

28:05.248 --> 28:08.215
you're so beautiful.

28:16.881 --> 28:18.315
wow.

28:18.348 --> 28:20.115
we did that.

28:21.782 --> 28:23.782
lana, are you okay?

28:23.815 --> 28:25.048
nurse?

28:25.081 --> 28:27.081
hemorrhaging.
we need to start transfusing.

28:27.115 --> 28:28.582
what's happening?

28:28.615 --> 28:30.281
someone
get him out of here.

28:30.315 --> 28:31.582
i'm sorry, sir,
you'll have to leave.

28:31.615 --> 28:33.849
lana?

28:33.881 --> 28:36.415
nurse, start a drip.

28:36.448 --> 28:41.048
let's get her
into the o.r. now.

28:55.785 --> 28:57.151
mr. luthor?

28:57.185 --> 28:58.552
how is she?

28:58.585 --> 29:00.552
i'm sorry, but your wife
has lost a lot of blood.

29:00.585 --> 29:02.318
we're trying to control it,
but --

29:02.352 --> 29:04.752
there's got to be something
you can do.

29:18.905 --> 29:22.439
dad, i --
i, uh, need your help.

29:22.472 --> 29:23.938
i don't doubt it.

29:23.971 --> 29:26.671
why else would you be here
christmas eve?

29:29.338 --> 29:30.771
it's lana, dad.

29:30.805 --> 29:33.038
they started transfusions,

29:33.072 --> 29:35.771
but we've got to get her
to a specialist.

29:35.805 --> 29:38.771
there's a surgeon in metropolis
at the davis clinic.

29:42.505 --> 29:45.638
oh, lex,
what a sorry situation

29:45.671 --> 29:48.704
you have gotten
yourself into.

29:52.638 --> 29:56.871
i don't think
you understand.

29:56.905 --> 29:59.805
my wife is dying, and i need
the helijet to save her.

29:59.838 --> 30:02.072
i understand you
perfectly.

30:02.105 --> 30:04.072
you turned your back on me
seven years ago,

30:04.105 --> 30:05.704
but now you need my help.

30:05.738 --> 30:07.671
so, now you have no problem
banging on my door,

30:07.704 --> 30:09.704
begging for favors
in the name of family.

30:09.738 --> 30:11.938
i'm talking about lana!

30:11.971 --> 30:14.439
i know we've had
our differences,

30:14.472 --> 30:16.771
but my wife --

30:16.805 --> 30:19.138
she's the mother
of your grandchildren.

30:20.871 --> 30:22.838
how could i
have grandchildren?

30:22.871 --> 30:24.771
i don't have a son.

30:27.005 --> 30:29.138
you bastard!

30:31.604 --> 30:34.539
you can save her.

30:37.671 --> 30:41.505
no, lex.

30:41.539 --> 30:44.472
i'm not gonna do that.

30:44.505 --> 30:47.105
don't you understand
that every decision you've made

30:47.138 --> 30:49.072
has brought you
to this very moment,

30:49.105 --> 30:51.405
beginning that day
seven years ago

30:51.439 --> 30:52.838
in the hospital

30:52.871 --> 30:55.571
when you decided to fot
the state senate race

30:55.604 --> 30:58.072
to jonathan kent?

30:58.105 --> 31:02.805
i told you
this would happen.

31:02.838 --> 31:06.372
i warned you, but you chose
to give up your family.

31:06.405 --> 31:08.205
and when you made
that decision,

31:08.238 --> 31:10.205
you gave up the money
and the power

31:10.238 --> 31:14.138
that would've enabled you
to save your wife.

31:21.671 --> 31:23.439
pathetic.

31:32.838 --> 31:35.072
you said
you didn't want to be a luthor,

31:35.105 --> 31:37.072
that you wanted instead
to be free

31:37.105 --> 31:38.771
to live
happily ever after.

31:41.738 --> 31:44.005
go on, then, lex.

31:47.771 --> 31:51.439
you better get back
to it.

32:01.172 --> 32:05.005
lana...please.

32:05.038 --> 32:07.472
don't give up.

32:07.505 --> 32:10.138
don't leave me.

32:14.138 --> 32:16.238
lex.

32:16.272 --> 32:19.072
hey.

32:25.505 --> 32:28.938
you have to be strong, lex,

32:28.971 --> 32:32.671
for alexander...
for lily.

32:32.704 --> 32:35.472
lana...

32:37.472 --> 32:41.372
...i love you.

32:41.405 --> 32:44.871
maybe i tell you that
all the time -- i don't know --

32:44.905 --> 32:47.971
but please listen to me.

32:48.005 --> 32:52.172
i mean it.
i love you.

32:52.205 --> 32:56.372
i have always loved you.

32:56.405 --> 33:01.038
i love you, too,
lex luthor.

33:04.372 --> 33:06.671
you're a good man.

33:10.372 --> 33:12.704
don't ever change.

33:48.972 --> 33:51.672
what did you do to her?

33:51.705 --> 33:55.139
why didn't you
stop this?

33:55.171 --> 33:57.605
i thought you were showing me
a better life.

33:57.638 --> 34:00.672
i was, lex. i <i>am.</i>

34:00.705 --> 34:04.371
a life
where my wife dies?

34:04.405 --> 34:06.405
a life full of pain?

34:06.438 --> 34:08.705
no, lex,
a life full of <i>love.</i>

34:08.737 --> 34:11.139
love?

34:11.170 --> 34:14.371
everyone i've ever loved
has died.

34:14.405 --> 34:19.204
first julian
and then you...

34:19.237 --> 34:22.638
and now lana's dead.

34:22.672 --> 34:25.772
and i couldn't do anything
to stop it.

34:30.039 --> 34:31.871
lex? son...
lana!

34:31.905 --> 34:33.772
...i'm here.

34:33.804 --> 34:37.170
you're in metropolis, lex,
at the davis clinic.

34:38.871 --> 34:41.838
you've been shot.

34:41.871 --> 34:44.538
but you're gonna be
all right.

35:17.371 --> 35:19.705
merry christmas, chloe.

35:19.738 --> 35:22.471
santa?

35:22.504 --> 35:25.905
suit gave me away, huh?
[ chuckles ]

35:27.438 --> 35:29.872
uh, what, uh, what --
what do you want?

35:29.905 --> 35:32.404
i met a friend of yours --
young clark kent.

35:32.438 --> 35:34.339
he told me
what you two were doing,

35:34.371 --> 35:37.705
how you were giving up
your respective christmas eves.

35:37.738 --> 35:40.038
i figured you could use
a little help.

35:40.072 --> 35:41.838
shouldn't you be,
you know,

35:41.872 --> 35:44.105
standing on a street corner
with a bell?

35:44.138 --> 35:46.038
[ laughs ] come on.

35:46.072 --> 35:47.838
let me give you two a hand,

35:47.872 --> 35:50.471
take a little bit
of the pressure off.

35:50.504 --> 35:53.072
i am familiar with the job,
you know.

35:54.272 --> 35:57.339
i don't know.

35:57.371 --> 35:59.105
give me a chance.

35:59.138 --> 36:01.605
worst-case scenario --

36:01.638 --> 36:05.038
i make off
with a few free squirt guns.

36:07.905 --> 36:10.638
well, we definitely could use
all the help we can get.

36:10.671 --> 36:13.538
and at least no one's gonna
accuse you of being a scab

36:13.571 --> 36:15.138
in a santa outfit.

36:16.838 --> 36:18.239
all right, um,

36:18.272 --> 36:20.738
i've organized the addresses
from east to west,

36:20.771 --> 36:22.272
so if you just...

36:42.738 --> 36:46.272
lex, you wanted to talk
to me?

36:49.404 --> 36:53.038
whatever it is, son, it can wait
till you're stronger.

36:53.072 --> 36:56.671
you're right.

36:56.705 --> 36:59.404
i should probably
be resting.

36:59.438 --> 37:00.972
after all,

37:01.005 --> 37:04.671
i did just undergo
a life-threatening operation.

37:16.738 --> 37:18.972
dr. litvack told me
the odds of survival

37:19.005 --> 37:20.905
i had going into surgery.

37:22.838 --> 37:27.438
pretty reckless roll
of the dice, don't you think?

37:27.471 --> 37:29.172
on the contrary, son.

37:29.205 --> 37:31.805
what i did
may appear callous,

37:31.838 --> 37:34.905
but opting for my son
to have surgery

37:34.938 --> 37:36.972
was a deliberate decision.

37:37.005 --> 37:39.239
but it wasn't your decision
to make, was it?

37:41.172 --> 37:43.138
you went against
the doctors' advice

37:43.172 --> 37:47.105
not because
you wanted to save me,

37:47.138 --> 37:51.239
but because you couldn't bear
having a cripple for a son.

37:55.272 --> 37:57.272
you may hate me
for taking the risk,

37:57.305 --> 37:59.038
but i had to make
a choice.

38:02.371 --> 38:05.404
and you're alive...

38:05.438 --> 38:07.072
and you can walk.

38:07.105 --> 38:09.072
i had to give you
that chance.

38:09.105 --> 38:13.305
and what if
i hadn't made it?

38:13.339 --> 38:16.105
how would you have justified
your decision then?

38:23.771 --> 38:26.872
how dare you play god
with my life.

38:34.305 --> 38:35.972
hey, hey, no!

38:36.005 --> 38:38.504
come on, come on.
outside.

38:38.538 --> 38:39.972
mel.

38:40.005 --> 38:41.705
the dog.

38:45.838 --> 38:47.938
chloe: so, then
i turn back around

38:47.972 --> 38:50.172
and your tubby,
little miscreant is gone

38:50.205 --> 38:52.605
along with all the toys.

38:52.638 --> 38:53.872
yeah, right.

38:53.905 --> 38:55.771
the same guy,
the drunk santa,

38:55.805 --> 38:57.905
the guy who i just talked off
the roof of a building.

38:57.938 --> 38:59.838
yes, honestly, clark.

38:59.872 --> 39:02.972
i'm sure that i was tired enough
to have imagined santa,

39:03.005 --> 39:05.538
but there is no way
i could've dreamed away

39:05.571 --> 39:08.504
all of those wiffle balls
and game boys.

39:08.538 --> 39:10.905
maybe he really is...

39:10.938 --> 39:12.239
yeah, right.

39:12.272 --> 39:15.872
come on, clark,
there's a chance.

39:17.339 --> 39:19.805
martha: look, everybody,
it's snowing.

39:21.272 --> 39:23.738
oh, we are gonna have
a white christmas.

39:28.072 --> 39:30.205
[ laughing ]
hey!

39:34.471 --> 39:36.404
merry christmas, lana.

39:36.438 --> 39:38.972
merry <i>first</i> christmas
together, clark --

39:39.005 --> 39:40.905
first of many.

39:47.538 --> 39:51.239
i thought you didn't make
house calls.

39:53.272 --> 39:56.172
given the circumstances,
i made an exception.

39:58.339 --> 40:00.404
oh, not to worry, griff.

40:00.438 --> 40:03.605
we luthors are made
of pretty tough

40:03.638 --> 40:06.705
and definitely expensive
material.

40:06.738 --> 40:09.905
you sure your morphine drip
isn't turned up too high?

40:09.938 --> 40:13.671
it's not every day that one has
a near-death experience.

40:13.705 --> 40:17.172
and it's true.

40:17.205 --> 40:19.371
much like ebenezer scrooge,

40:19.404 --> 40:23.938
i realized that what i want
more than anything...

40:23.972 --> 40:26.805
is to live
happily ever after.

40:34.038 --> 40:36.005
and do you know
what the secret

40:36.038 --> 40:38.038
to living
happily ever after is?

40:40.905 --> 40:43.738
power.

40:43.771 --> 40:47.105
money and power.

40:48.805 --> 40:51.305
see, once you have
those two things,

40:51.339 --> 40:53.471
you can secure
everything else...

40:53.504 --> 40:58.371
and keep it that way.

40:58.404 --> 41:01.705
so, what am i
doing here, lex?

41:07.438 --> 41:10.404
i want you to pull the pin
on that grenade.

41:13.404 --> 41:16.272
find it, fake it...

41:16.305 --> 41:18.339
do whatever it takes

41:18.371 --> 41:22.438
to knock jonathan kent
out of the race.

41:22.471 --> 41:25.205
i want to be senator.

41:27.571 --> 41:30.705
i want it all.

41:33.005 --> 41:34.671
consider it done.

41:38.138 --> 41:39.538
merry christmas.
