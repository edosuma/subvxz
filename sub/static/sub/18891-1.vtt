<i>T.U.A., three five heavy,</i>

00:48.465 --> 00:49.933
<i>descend to 3000 feet.</i>

00:50.884 --> 00:52.978
<i>Minneapolis center,
this is Trans-Universal</i>

00:53.178 --> 00:55.931
<i>three five heavy,
descending to 3000.</i>

00:56.515 --> 00:58.076
<i>Roger,
T.U.A. three five heavy.</i>

00:59.059 --> 01:01.300
<i>T.U.A. three five heavy, could
you give me your location?</i>

01:01.895 --> 01:03.317
Ron, where the hell are we?

01:03.522 --> 01:05.364
25 miles due
south on approach,

01:05.566 --> 01:07.568
descending through 5000 feet.

01:08.151 --> 01:09.752
<i>Three five, what is
your current heading?</i>

01:09.945 --> 01:10.912
What's his problem?

01:11.572 --> 01:13.620
Minneapolis, we are
currently heading zero-

01:13.824 --> 01:15.185
<i>T.U.A. three five,
turn to heading-</i>

01:16.368 --> 01:17.961
Say again, Minneapolis.

01:21.540 --> 01:22.257
Jesus, down.

01:22.457 --> 01:23.834
Oh my God.

01:24.001 --> 01:25.093
Down, go down.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.844
My God, we hit 'em, we hit 'em!

01:32.593 --> 01:35.642
Minneapolis, this
is T.U.A. three five.

01:36.388 --> 01:39.483
Declaring an emergency,
we hit another aircraft.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.651
Looked like a 10.

01:41.852 --> 01:44.321
Three and four shutting down,
cutting fuel to three.

01:44.521 --> 01:47.570
We are going down,
repeat, going down.

01:48.275 --> 01:49.697
How much of the wing is gone?

01:49.901 --> 01:51.153
Ron, get back there.
See how much we have left.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.362
Right.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.206
- There he is.
- Excuse me!

04:13.253 --> 04:16.132
Mr. Smith, I'm Kevin Briley,
from the Minneapolis office-

04:16.339 --> 04:17.807
And you're not doing your job.

04:18.007 --> 04:20.261
Round these people up and
shove 'em in a room somewhere.

04:21.052 --> 04:22.554
Make no statement
'till I get back.

04:22.763 --> 04:23.935
Ashby, tell 'em what we need.

04:24.139 --> 04:25.186
Right, c'mon, move it.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.767
The rest of y'all, let's go.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.235
- Move it!
- Back up, back up.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.482
Come on, people,
let's go now, do it!

05:27.994 --> 05:29.837
Where'd the DC-10 go down?

05:30.038 --> 05:31.415
10 miles to the south.

05:32.207 --> 05:34.255
Jerry, Eli, go take a look.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.011
Tom and I'll put down here.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.050
Wanna give me
a hand with this?

06:28.847 --> 06:29.723
Bill.

06:29.931 --> 06:30.727
Alright.

06:30.932 --> 06:31.649
Bill.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.370
Get the
flashlight over here!

06:33.435 --> 06:34.857
We were just going after
the flight data recorder.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.233
You wanna do that next?

06:36.438 --> 06:37.439
Sure.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.570
I think that the
DC-10 site came down

06:39.774 --> 06:41.026
a lot harder than this one.

06:41.443 --> 06:42.615
What happened here?

06:42.819 --> 06:44.321
Well, he managed
to get it level,

06:45.155 --> 06:47.032
but you might have noticed
there's only three engines.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.361
One came down south of here.

06:48.533 --> 06:49.876
So he lost a lot of wing?

06:50.118 --> 06:51.244
We think so, yeah.

06:55.373 --> 06:56.920
We started on the site map,

06:57.459 --> 07:00.133
and the cops have finally
stopped moving things around.

07:01.838 --> 07:04.182
Look, Bill, uh, we're
being very careful but

07:04.382 --> 07:06.805
we don't think that this is a
structural failure, natural.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.131
Do you have any numbers yet?

07:08.219 --> 07:09.846
Yeah, yeah,
got 'em right here.

07:12.307 --> 07:16.938
This one had 354 and 13 crew
and the 10 had 265 and 11.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.201
Watch that wing section there.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.377
Do you already have the
cockpit voice recorder?

07:33.620 --> 07:35.748
Yeah, we have it,
but it's pretty battered.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.549
They're working on it now.

07:39.042 --> 07:41.761
I want a dub made before you
send it on to Washington.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.841
Alright, I'll tell 'em,
but it might not be too good.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.517
It's a silly rule.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.521
Why should the boys in
Washington hear it first?

07:52.055 --> 07:53.181
I gotta hear what
those poor bastards

07:53.390 --> 07:56.394
were up against after
they hit the 10.

07:56.601 --> 07:59.775
I'm sure they did their best.
They always do.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.815
Are you one of Roger's team?

08:02.023 --> 08:03.900
I'm Dr. Arnold Mayer.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.285
I'm the investigator
in charge, Bill Smith.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.783
Bill Smith,
yes, I know.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.160
I've read many of
your crash reports.

08:09.364 --> 08:10.957
Naturally I've
heard of you, Doctor.

08:12.075 --> 08:13.497
What's your interest here?

08:13.702 --> 08:14.919
You want me to leave?

08:16.496 --> 08:18.169
No, it doesn't matter.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.925
All this just seems
pretty far removed

08:21.126 --> 08:22.503
from your physics lab.

08:22.711 --> 08:24.964
Maybe scientists should
leave the lab more often.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.173
They might learn some things.

08:27.549 --> 08:29.426
Dr. Mayer, what's
an ecology professor

08:29.634 --> 08:31.261
doing at a crash site?

08:31.469 --> 08:32.749
Do you know someone
on the plane?

08:32.761 --> 08:34.014
Not that I'm aware of.

08:35.306 --> 08:36.785
How did you hear
about the crash, sir?

08:36.975 --> 08:38.174
I got a call from a
television.

08:38.226 --> 08:40.027
He's the last guy I'd
expect to find out here.

08:40.145 --> 08:41.647
Yeah, actually, he's not.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.778
He's been to several
midwest crashes.

08:44.649 --> 08:47.243
That big one in '79 at O'Hare,
he was all over that one.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.364
I wonder why.

08:53.450 --> 08:56.078
I don't think it will win
him another Nobel prize.

09:05.837 --> 09:07.305
Over here, I got it!

09:14.888 --> 09:16.856
There's a whole
mob here from Boeing,

09:17.057 --> 09:19.276
and the man from McDonnell
Douglas is on the way.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.861
Wes Lake from the F.B.I is here,

09:22.395 --> 09:25.023
and the assistant D.A.
from Ramsey County.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.949
Okay, the usual gang.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.921
Mr. Janz, I'm Bill
Smith of the NTSB.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.601
Mr. Smith, my name
is Raymond Leacock.

09:41.623 --> 09:43.000
I represent Mr. Janz.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.836
Is this a formal deposition?

09:46.044 --> 09:46.920
Not yet.

09:47.128 --> 09:48.630
I'm sitting in on this.

09:49.172 --> 09:50.469
Bill, meet Ian Carpenter.

09:50.673 --> 09:53.176
He's with the Air Traffic
Controllers Organization.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.228
Mr. Janz, I know this
is a hard time for you.

10:00.308 --> 10:03.403
I want to hear what you saw,
and what your actions were.

10:03.937 --> 10:07.817
We were handling 40
flights, three of us,

10:08.733 --> 10:10.110
plus the private planes.

10:11.986 --> 10:13.704
The screen was so crowded.

10:16.241 --> 10:18.494
And a goddamned headache.

10:21.746 --> 10:22.872
I was tired.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.586
35 was coming in from the east.

10:30.296 --> 10:35.018
No, from the west,
and 880 was coming in.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.934
Was that the 747, Don?

10:46.521 --> 10:48.023
I looked away for a moment.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.614
Some other situation.

10:52.610 --> 10:56.240
And when I looked back,
they'd changed places.

10:59.534 --> 11:02.708
I told 35 to turn.
They were close, man.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.835
And then the numbers switched.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.715
You couldn't tell
'em apart anymore.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.400
Somebody's got these guys

11:28.605 --> 11:30.152
working harder and faster
than I've ever seen.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.824
Well, that DC-10
was pretty public.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.948
It spread itself over
a field not half a mile

11:34.152 --> 11:35.495
from the Interstate.

11:35.695 --> 11:36.787
Right.

11:36.988 --> 11:38.789
And they don't want
people gawking at their...

11:38.823 --> 11:41.042
What was it they called
that crash in Florida?

11:41.242 --> 11:42.789
Involuntary conversion.

11:42.994 --> 11:43.870
I think they made
a profit on that

11:44.078 --> 11:45.295
when the insurance paid off.

11:45.496 --> 11:46.668
Yeah, well,
they sure are

11:46.873 --> 11:48.500
busting their asses on this one.

11:49.626 --> 11:50.826
Look at that,
they even got the

11:50.877 --> 11:52.971
ticket agents serving coffee.

11:55.465 --> 11:57.888
Mr. Keane,
where does this go?

11:58.092 --> 11:59.532
What do you wanna
do with this stuff?

11:59.636 --> 12:01.354
Did I tell you you
could touch that?

12:01.554 --> 12:02.851
Excuse me.
Put that down!

12:03.056 --> 12:04.308
Just put that down.

12:06.851 --> 12:07.852
Hey.

12:11.439 --> 12:12.941
How about some coffee?

12:17.695 --> 12:19.072
Hey, wait a minute.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.498
I think she likes you, Bill.

12:24.702 --> 12:25.794
What'd I do?

12:25.995 --> 12:27.713
Could it be your breath?

12:27.914 --> 12:29.434
I thought you always
got that reaction.

12:29.499 --> 12:32.844
Gentlemen, they're ready
to play the cockpit tapes.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.807
<i>Minneapolis,
we are currently heading zero-</i>

12:45.014 --> 12:46.934
<i>T.U.A. three five,
turn to heading-</i>

12:48.142 --> 12:49.439
<i>Say again, Minneapolis.</i>

12:53.898 --> 12:54.865
<i>...Jesus, down.</i>

12:55.066 --> 12:56.318
<i>Oh my God.</i>

12:56.526 --> 12:57.652
<i>Down, go down.</i>

13:00.113 --> 13:02.491
<i>My God,
we hit 'em, we hit 'em!</i>

13:04.784 --> 13:08.084
<i>Minneapolis,
this is T.U.A. three five,</i>

13:08.871 --> 13:11.715
<i>We hit another aircraft.</i>

13:12.583 --> 13:13.755
<i>Looked like a 10.</i>

13:14.294 --> 13:15.454
<i>Three and four shutting down,</i>

13:15.586 --> 13:17.133
<i>cutting fuel to three.</i>

13:17.338 --> 13:20.308
<i>We are going down,
repeat, going down.</i>

13:20.717 --> 13:21.838
<i>How much
of the wing is gone?</i>

13:21.884 --> 13:23.807
<i>Ron, get back there,
see how much we have left.</i>

13:24.012 --> 13:25.104
<i>Right.</i>

13:25.888 --> 13:27.060
Would you like some
coffee, Mr. Smith?

13:27.265 --> 13:28.357
Dammit, I'm listenin'-

13:28.558 --> 13:30.811
<i>Still going down.</i>
<i>Is there any place to</i> land?

13:31.019 --> 13:31.645
<i>I'll check-</i>

14:10.850 --> 14:12.318
Can you rewind that a little?

14:17.148 --> 14:19.697
<i>Still going down.</i>
<i>Is there any place to</i> land?

14:19.901 --> 14:21.323
<i>I'll check for a field.</i>

14:21.527 --> 14:23.450
<i>Just look for
a flat place, anything.</i>

14:24.906 --> 14:25.998
<i>We'll be on the ground in-</i>

14:26.199 --> 14:27.451
<i>They're dead,
they're all dead.</i>

14:27.658 --> 14:28.580
<i>What the hell's
he talking about?</i>

14:28.785 --> 14:29.786
<i>Sit down for
Christ's sake, Ron.</i>

14:29.994 --> 14:31.871
<i>They're dead,
all of 'em, they're burned up.</i>

14:34.040 --> 14:34.882
<i>Jesus.</i>

14:35.083 --> 14:37.085
<i>Yes, here it comes.</i>

14:53.518 --> 14:55.270
Was that Kennedy shouting?

14:55.478 --> 14:57.071
Yeah, Rockwell couldn't
understand him.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.366
Run that last
part through again.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.989
I'll see if I can
clean it up a bit for ya.

15:12.537 --> 15:15.086
<i>Just look for a
flat place, anything.</i>

15:16.833 --> 15:17.873
<i>We'll be on the ground in-</i>

15:17.875 --> 15:19.075
<i>They're dead,
they're all dead!</i>

15:19.085 --> 15:20.007
<i>What the hell's
he talking about?</i>

15:20.211 --> 15:21.451
<i>Sit down for
Christ's sake, Ron.</i>

15:21.504 --> 15:23.472
<i>They're dead,
all of them, they're burned up.</i>

15:23.673 --> 15:24.674
<i>Jesus.</i>

15:28.719 --> 15:29.561
Burned up?

15:29.762 --> 15:30.763
They were going to be.

15:30.972 --> 15:32.724
They might as well
have been dead already.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.400
Makes me sick.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.147
Yeah, but it
doesn't make sense.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.896
You expect him to make
sense at a time like that?

15:39.105 --> 15:40.823
No, not like that.

15:41.399 --> 15:43.447
Okay, I'll back the pilots.

15:43.651 --> 15:46.746
Like they say, they're the first
on the scene of the accident.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.415
But how many crash
tapes have you heard?

15:50.992 --> 15:52.209
God, too many.

15:53.536 --> 15:54.412
But how many times do you hear

15:54.620 --> 15:55.997
a man come apart like that?

15:57.498 --> 16:01.173
Okay, but it's
gotta happen sometime.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.055
He goes back there and
sees all those people

16:04.255 --> 16:06.599
who are gonna die and
it's too much for him.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.185
Obviously they
hadn't burned up yet.

16:09.385 --> 16:13.686
Well, what about, if, uh,
maybe, maybe there was a fire

16:13.890 --> 16:15.770
in the cabin, maybe they
were burned up already?

16:15.975 --> 16:17.568
Sorry, but that won't work.

16:18.561 --> 16:22.065
The fuselage was unaffected
by fire until after impact.

16:28.112 --> 16:30.160
He just broke
under the strain.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.247
Get me a transcript
of that tape.

16:34.577 --> 16:36.875
Roger, set up a press
conference for tonight.

16:38.289 --> 16:40.291
Let's go see what the
dead have to say about it.

16:40.958 --> 16:43.757
This gymnasium, is this the
biggest place they could find?

16:43.961 --> 16:46.242
Oh, Bill, I've got
something interesting for you.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.557
These are pretty
good bodies in here.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.513
Next door we got
stuff from the DC-10,

16:53.721 --> 16:56.190
which is mostly pieces,
can't be identified.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.484
Next of kin are gonna have
to look at personal effects,

16:58.684 --> 17:01.062
mostly, not many
faces to show them.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.398
Then the F.B.I. takes over.

17:03.606 --> 17:04.607
We'll be lucky to tag 60%

17:04.815 --> 17:06.532
for fingerprints
and dental charts.

17:06.733 --> 17:08.611
Not enough hands,
not enough heads.

17:08.819 --> 17:12.039
We autopsied a few, and
they died of trauma,

17:12.240 --> 17:13.742
dismemberment,
burns, the usual.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.367
We gotta get some
reefer trucks in here,

17:15.576 --> 17:16.292
and some airtight coffins-

17:16.493 --> 17:17.586
Yeah, they're on their way.

17:17.869 --> 17:18.746
Look, I only got this
place for two days.

17:18.954 --> 17:19.705
I got a dance-

17:19.914 --> 17:20.836
Trucks will be here.

17:21.624 --> 17:22.715
Okay.

17:22.916 --> 17:24.357
Now, here's what I
wanted you to see.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.220
Two kinds of watches, okay?

17:26.878 --> 17:28.881
Mechanicals here,
and digitals here.

17:29.257 --> 17:31.351
Now, these digitals
didn't do so good.

17:31.551 --> 17:32.973
Mostly they're blank.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.305
Heat must have
wiped 'em out.

17:35.513 --> 17:37.515
But we did find this.

17:39.517 --> 17:40.643
Yeah, so what?

17:40.851 --> 17:42.068
Well, so take a closer look.

17:46.774 --> 17:47.946
It's going backwards.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.124
This better not be a joke.

17:59.495 --> 18:00.371
It's not.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.961
Somebody had a gag watch.

18:03.624 --> 18:06.468
Well, we thought of that.
Look at this.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.688
Good evening.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.241
You all have copies of
the prepared statement.

18:28.983 --> 18:31.406
I'm William Smith,
investigator in charge.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.831
I'll try to answer your
questions, but I warn you,

18:35.031 --> 18:36.999
we don't know much more
than is in that statement.

18:37.199 --> 18:38.079
Who wants to go first?

18:38.159 --> 18:39.911
Mr. Smith!

18:40.119 --> 18:41.871
Sir, there have been
rumors of some type

18:42.079 --> 18:43.959
of computer error being
the cause of this crash.

18:43.998 --> 18:45.170
Can you confirm this?

18:45.374 --> 18:47.494
That's being looked at.
I can't say more at this time.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.096
When can we talk
to the controller

18:50.296 --> 18:51.673
who was handling the planes?

18:51.881 --> 18:53.474
You'll have to take that
up with the man's lawyer.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.972
Mr. Smith, you're
on record as issuing

18:56.177 --> 18:57.770
a pretty harsh
indictment of the FAA

18:57.970 --> 19:00.473
for failing to require
anti-collision devices

19:00.681 --> 19:03.309
on all commercial
and private aircraft,

19:03.517 --> 19:05.360
even though, as you note,
these devices

19:05.561 --> 19:07.404
have been available
for over a decade.

19:08.356 --> 19:09.949
Would you care to comment?

19:10.358 --> 19:12.827
Dr. Mayer, do you have any
idea what caused this crash?

19:13.027 --> 19:15.405
One of Newton's Laws,
I suspect, the one about gravity.

19:15.613 --> 19:16.990
Beyond that I don't know
any more than you do.

19:17.198 --> 19:18.745
Can I have an
interview, Doctor?

19:18.949 --> 19:20.622
Gentlemen, please,
I have to get in there

19:20.826 --> 19:22.169
and ask some
questions of my own.

19:22.370 --> 19:23.417
Would you care to reply

19:23.621 --> 19:25.168
to the charge made
by Mr. Carpenter?

19:25.373 --> 19:27.626
No reply at this time.
Next question.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.382
Mr. Smith,
I'm Dr. Arnold Mayer,

19:30.586 --> 19:32.680
professor of physics
at the university.

19:34.215 --> 19:35.216
I remember you.

19:35.800 --> 19:36.926
Thank you.

19:37.593 --> 19:39.470
My question has
nothing to do with

19:39.679 --> 19:42.979
overloaded computers or
negligent air traffic controllers.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.563
That should be refreshing.

19:45.768 --> 19:46.940
I doubt it.

19:48.062 --> 19:50.656
What unusual facts
have you developed

19:50.856 --> 19:52.449
so far in your investigation?

19:54.318 --> 19:55.865
I'm not sure I
know what you mean.

19:56.779 --> 19:58.781
Were there any
unexplained observations?

19:59.740 --> 20:01.959
Is there any indication
that this crash was caused

20:02.159 --> 20:05.003
by something less obvious
than a computer overload?

20:05.454 --> 20:08.207
None at all, of course,
every crash is unique.

20:08.416 --> 20:09.793
Yet they share common factors.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.241
There are things you expect
to find and things you don't.

20:12.837 --> 20:14.180
For instance, is there
anything in the cockpit

20:14.380 --> 20:16.060
voice recording that's
out of the ordinary?

20:16.882 --> 20:18.725
I can't comment on that;
it's confidential.

20:19.677 --> 20:22.055
The relevant portions will be
released in a couple of days.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.022
You can listen for yourself.

20:24.974 --> 20:28.194
Alright, but is there
anything else odd?

20:29.603 --> 20:32.607
Have you found any unusual
item in the wreckage?

20:32.815 --> 20:35.284
Any discrepancies in the
time sequence of the crash?

20:38.320 --> 20:40.698
I'm afraid I still don't
know what you're driving at.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.705
I can't be more plain
without sounding like a fool.

20:43.909 --> 20:46.879
I'm simply looking for the
inexplicable; I usually find it.

20:48.164 --> 20:51.338
Look, somebody made a mistake,
and a lot of people died.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.640
In a few days we should
be able to tell you

20:54.712 --> 20:55.964
what went wrong.

20:56.547 --> 20:58.299
There's no mystery about it.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.009
Then I salute you.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.514
I'll read your
report with interest.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.850
<i>All T.U.A. personnel,</i>

21:08.058 --> 21:10.607
<i>please check with your
supervisor for shift changes.</i>

21:11.437 --> 21:13.439
So, is there anything
else you need tonight?

21:14.398 --> 21:16.400
I want the salvage team
to work through the night.

21:17.234 --> 21:18.326
You got it.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.117
Better keep crew
at the hangar, too.

21:21.822 --> 21:23.745
Might as well start
getting it all sorted out.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.075
Alright, it's done.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.127
Oh, my secretary
managed to get you

21:27.328 --> 21:29.001
a room at the Marriott.

21:30.331 --> 21:31.924
Tom, you're staying
at the Holiday Inn.

21:33.334 --> 21:34.836
Privilege of rank, I guess.

21:35.044 --> 21:37.467
Why? They got a big beauty
pageant there tonight.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.264
Miss I-94.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.968
You know,
I hear the bar's pretty wild.

21:42.176 --> 21:44.929
Well, I'm outta here.

21:47.014 --> 21:49.563
Thanks, Roger, your
people did a great job.

21:49.767 --> 21:51.144
Our usual service.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.210
Alright, well,
I'll see you tomorrow.

21:54.396 --> 21:55.443
Yeah.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.832
<i>Los Angeles passenger
Mr. George Kelliman,</i>

22:05.032 --> 22:07.251
<i>please pick up the
white courtesy telephone.</i>

22:14.458 --> 22:17.337
<i>Mr. George Kelliman to the
white courtesy telephone, please..</i>

22:32.309 --> 22:33.982
I keep running into you.

22:34.395 --> 22:35.897
If you're not running away.

22:36.814 --> 22:38.054
I had to get out
of that hangar.

22:38.148 --> 22:39.900
I thought I was
going to be sick.

22:41.110 --> 22:43.454
I guess you get used
to it after a while.

22:47.116 --> 22:48.083
Excuse me.

22:50.619 --> 22:51.916
Well, we could be
stuck here for hours.

22:52.121 --> 22:53.919
Maybe we'd better
get acquainted.

22:54.999 --> 22:58.549
I'm Louise Baltimore,
and you're Bill Smith.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.306
How long is it since you slept?

23:03.257 --> 23:04.679
Do I look that bad?

23:06.218 --> 23:08.266
I didn't say bad,
just tired.

23:10.806 --> 23:14.106
It's gotta be 30, 35 hours,
but who needs sleep?

23:15.895 --> 23:17.363
Listen, maybe we
could go have coff-

23:17.563 --> 23:20.112
Some dinner, and a few
drinks, that'd be nifty.

23:20.941 --> 23:22.284
Am I moving too fast for you?

23:23.485 --> 23:25.237
I can move fast, too.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.282
Let's go.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.876
You should be careful,
picking up strange women.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.794
You never know
where it might lead.

23:54.350 --> 23:55.442
Taxi.

23:57.853 --> 23:59.230
We could take my car.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.149
What kind of car do you drive?

24:01.941 --> 24:02.908
What kind?

24:05.069 --> 24:06.241
That's mine.

24:19.041 --> 24:20.793
You smoke too much.

24:28.884 --> 24:29.885
I'll quit tomorrow.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.517
Just like that, huh?

24:35.975 --> 24:39.320
I've heard that story before,
took me over a year to quit.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.022
You don't believe me?

24:43.357 --> 24:45.325
This is my last cigarette.

24:53.867 --> 24:55.369
Was it that good?

24:57.913 --> 25:00.587
You were the best thing
in 1000 years, Bill.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.549
I was, wasn't I?

25:06.797 --> 25:07.764
I'm stunned.

25:08.632 --> 25:09.474
Why?

25:10.968 --> 25:12.936
It's been so long since I've...

25:15.097 --> 25:16.269
enjoyed myself...

25:19.143 --> 25:20.986
let alone been swept away.

25:25.107 --> 25:26.950
Do you believe in fate?

25:28.193 --> 25:29.866
I will if you will.

25:32.156 --> 25:34.158
I think it was fate that
brought us together.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.036
You may be right.

25:47.212 --> 25:48.839
I want to spend
more time with you.

25:50.674 --> 25:51.766
I'd like that.

25:53.844 --> 25:55.596
We'll have all day tomorrow.

25:57.306 --> 25:59.308
We'll have all tomorrow
night, anyway.

26:04.146 --> 26:05.898
This job is killing you, Bill.

26:11.111 --> 26:12.454
You need to take a rest.

26:18.118 --> 26:19.791
Take it with me.

26:23.624 --> 26:24.841
The first rule is...

26:26.460 --> 26:28.838
never go to bed with anybody
crazier than yourself.

26:30.881 --> 26:32.224
I don't know if you're crazier,

26:33.425 --> 26:35.473
but you're right up
there in the top ten

26:35.677 --> 26:37.520
of my weird list, lady.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.277
If you knew me better...

26:45.729 --> 26:47.106
I'd be number one.

27:48.125 --> 27:50.048
Yes, I'd like to cancel
the 6:30 wakeup.

27:51.086 --> 27:52.258
Yes.

27:54.965 --> 27:56.485
Damn it, they were
supposed to call me.

27:57.968 --> 28:00.187
Well, they can't start
'till you get there.

28:03.932 --> 28:05.900
Bill, you remember we
were talking about fate?

28:06.894 --> 28:07.986
Sure, I remember.

28:09.563 --> 28:11.736
Maybe that's why
they didn't call you.

28:18.322 --> 28:19.915
Are you listening to me?

28:21.033 --> 28:22.330
I don't get it.

28:23.410 --> 28:24.912
This job is wearing you down.

28:25.913 --> 28:26.880
I know it is.

28:27.873 --> 28:29.750
I can't just walk
away from it, Louise.

28:31.335 --> 28:32.882
Why not?

28:33.212 --> 28:35.681
The world's not gonna come to
an end if you just walk away.

28:37.883 --> 28:41.137
I haven't had a vacation in
six years, I got one coming.

28:42.221 --> 28:44.895
In one week, I'll have
this investigation started,

28:45.098 --> 28:46.941
and I can hand it
over to someone else.

28:47.893 --> 28:50.567
Then I'm gonna take a
long look at my life.

28:52.773 --> 28:54.821
Maybe we can go away
somewhere together.

28:57.444 --> 28:59.367
Anyway, we got tonight.

29:00.822 --> 29:02.699
I may not be here tonight.

29:21.677 --> 29:23.645
We'll talk about it tonight.

29:44.741 --> 29:45.993
Louise?

29:52.165 --> 29:53.792
Louise?

29:57.129 --> 29:59.427
Now, as to systems
surrounding engine number four,

29:59.631 --> 30:02.054
which was the one that
sheared off in the collision,

30:02.259 --> 30:04.933
let's consider the
fuel feed first.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.981
You'll find that on page 19
of the computer printout.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.566
Everybody got that?

30:13.770 --> 30:14.817
On line five you
will see there was

30:15.022 --> 30:17.320
a momentary surge when
fuel line number four

30:17.524 --> 30:20.243
was severed along with
25 feet of wing tip.

30:21.236 --> 30:22.357
They'll have a better figure

30:22.529 --> 30:23.850
on that by tomorrow,
they tell me.

30:24.865 --> 30:25.912
Smith.

30:26.366 --> 30:28.243
Julie, thanks for calling back.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.922
No, it has nothing to do
with the investigation.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.336
I can't understand it.

30:37.961 --> 30:39.963
She was wearing a T.U. outfit.

30:41.089 --> 30:43.467
That's right, Baltimore,
like the city.

30:44.468 --> 30:46.015
First name, Louise.

30:48.972 --> 30:50.315
I guess I made a mistake, then.

30:51.099 --> 30:52.476
Thanks, Julie.

30:52.684 --> 30:55.563
...It looks like the captain
had very little control.

31:00.275 --> 31:01.447
Good night, fellas.

31:01.651 --> 31:02.573
Good night.

31:19.294 --> 31:20.796
We're locking up, Mr. Smith.

31:23.673 --> 31:24.799
What's that?

31:25.008 --> 31:26.430
There'll be a guard
on that door over there.

31:26.635 --> 31:28.888
Just knock on the glass
when you want to go.

31:29.096 --> 31:30.643
I'll do that.
Good night.

31:35.519 --> 31:36.441
Hell of a mess, huh?

31:39.022 --> 31:40.148
One hell of a mess.

31:41.108 --> 31:42.200
Good night.

33:57.452 --> 33:58.499
Smith, isn't it?

33:58.703 --> 33:59.704
I'm not sure.

34:01.915 --> 34:03.115
Looks like the pictures I saw.

34:03.291 --> 34:04.008
Is he dead?

34:06.419 --> 34:07.420
Stunned.

34:07.754 --> 34:09.222
God dammit.

34:09.589 --> 34:10.761
Where's the stunner?

34:10.966 --> 34:11.808
There.

34:14.261 --> 34:15.808
He must have been
fooling with it.

34:16.846 --> 34:18.348
Is he out?

34:18.681 --> 34:20.802
Our luck, he's probably
seeing and hearing everything.

34:20.850 --> 34:22.773
If he is,
it's already too late.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.860
God,
what else can go wrong?

34:26.940 --> 34:28.567
Let's get the hell out.

34:38.243 --> 34:40.712
Smith, you're
gonna be all right.

34:41.871 --> 34:43.918
You don't know me and I
can't tell you who I am.

34:44.583 --> 34:45.583
But you're endangering
a project that's

34:45.792 --> 34:47.214
bigger than you can imagine.

34:47.627 --> 34:48.924
Forget about this.

34:49.170 --> 34:51.297
There's gonna be a
paradox if you don't.

34:53.132 --> 34:55.726
You...
You...

34:55.969 --> 34:57.642
Coventry, send the gate.

34:59.556 --> 35:00.773
My God, do you think...?

35:02.767 --> 35:04.690
We didn't make those
planes crash, I swear it.

35:23.371 --> 35:25.920
<i>Stand by for
time travellers arriving</i>

35:26.082 --> 35:30.553
<i>through gate Gantry D.
Operator, prepare for arrival.</i>

35:44.517 --> 35:47.145
We have major problems.
What happened?

35:47.854 --> 35:49.071
We got the stunner.

35:49.522 --> 35:50.899
Imagine my relief.

35:51.358 --> 35:53.577
<i>Louise,
I want an explanation.</i>

35:53.777 --> 35:55.120
Our master's voice.

36:00.241 --> 36:02.118
There was a little problem.

36:02.869 --> 36:04.667
Those words will be engraved

36:04.871 --> 36:06.794
in the annals of understatement.

36:07.874 --> 36:09.467
Your mother was
a cash register.

36:09.709 --> 36:12.212
And she turned a
tidy profit, too.

36:13.338 --> 36:16.057
Louise, what happened?

36:17.342 --> 36:19.390
<i>All gate operators,</i>

36:19.594 --> 36:22.222
<i>report to decontamination
center on shutdown.</i>

36:28.311 --> 36:29.528
Do you see that?

36:30.397 --> 36:32.365
Do you see the red
blob on the timeline?

36:33.733 --> 36:37.363
That is 1989.
That's where you just went.

36:38.321 --> 36:40.244
And there's the mess
you left behind you.

36:41.157 --> 36:42.750
It's a goddamn paradox, Louise.

36:42.951 --> 36:44.578
It's a potential paradox.

36:45.495 --> 36:47.215
You sent me back to get
the stunner we lost.

36:47.580 --> 36:48.877
Well, here it is.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.760
What you didn't mention
was that Smith was there.

36:51.960 --> 36:54.054
He'd already found it
and stunned himself.

36:54.254 --> 36:56.256
And I don't think he was
out when we found him.

36:56.756 --> 36:57.757
I think he saw us.

36:58.091 --> 37:00.844
Sir, I have a
timequake approaching.

37:01.678 --> 37:03.931
Paradox, time quake approaching.

37:04.139 --> 37:05.391
Four, three.

37:14.107 --> 37:16.951
A paradox, Louise.
You've changed the past.

37:17.694 --> 37:19.822
I know damn well we
can't change the past.

37:20.029 --> 37:23.203
It catches up with us.
We change.

37:23.992 --> 37:25.585
Well, we haven't changed much.

37:25.785 --> 37:28.129
We're all still dying,
this place still stinks,

37:28.329 --> 37:30.457
and you are still
as ugly as ever.

37:31.416 --> 37:34.169
One not much bigger than that
could destroy us completely.

37:34.377 --> 37:36.497
Look, you're the one that's
supposed to scan the past.

37:36.546 --> 37:38.389
Why didn't you know Smith
was gonna be in that hangar?

37:38.590 --> 37:40.217
And you're supposed to be
ready for the unexpected.

37:40.425 --> 37:41.927
You're supposed to be the best.

37:43.011 --> 37:44.651
You and your people
get all the best food,

37:44.721 --> 37:47.565
all the best quarters,
all our precious medicine.

37:49.058 --> 37:51.356
Do you realize what it
costs to pamper you?

37:52.937 --> 37:54.780
He was there,
he was in the dark.

37:55.899 --> 37:57.339
What did you want
me to do, kill him?

37:57.901 --> 37:58.823
Oh, you'd like that.

37:59.027 --> 38:01.621
Killing him would create the
worst paradox imaginable.

38:02.363 --> 38:04.582
His life affects
thousands of other lives

38:05.283 --> 38:07.752
in an endless chain,
and if you break it-

38:07.952 --> 38:10.000
You get a thousand
years of bad luck.

38:10.997 --> 38:12.795
And none of us is here anymore.

38:15.710 --> 38:16.882
Alright.

38:21.758 --> 38:23.038
Let's go find out what happened.

38:23.510 --> 38:25.228
Maybe we can still do something.

38:30.058 --> 38:32.481
All I'm getting is temporal
censorship from her jump.

38:33.686 --> 38:34.903
Scan past it.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.737
What does temporal
censorship mean?

38:38.399 --> 38:40.493
It means we can't
see where we've been,

38:40.693 --> 38:41.865
or where we're going to.

38:42.821 --> 38:45.119
We can only go back to a
specific moment once,

38:45.323 --> 38:47.291
and never to that
same moment again.

38:47.492 --> 38:49.540
Too bad. If we could
see where were gonna go-

38:49.744 --> 38:50.904
You'll get used to it, Susan,

38:50.995 --> 38:52.475
after you've done a
few more missions.

38:54.415 --> 38:55.917
There he is,
in the shadow.

38:56.668 --> 38:58.511
Give us rapid
scan until he moves.

39:23.069 --> 39:24.195
Louise?

39:26.865 --> 39:28.117
He knows my name.

39:29.450 --> 39:31.202
You probably dropped
your calling card.

39:33.454 --> 39:34.876
Louise.

39:35.331 --> 39:37.299
I didn't mention my name,
neither did anyone else.

39:38.918 --> 39:40.295
How does he know my name?

39:40.503 --> 39:41.925
He's got the initiator.

39:52.098 --> 39:53.725
Smith had met me
before, hadn't he?

39:53.933 --> 39:55.526
How else would
he know your name?

39:56.519 --> 39:58.192
I'd never been
back to that era.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.490
Do you want me to
spell it out for you?

40:01.482 --> 40:02.779
Give it a try,
would ya?

40:03.484 --> 40:06.158
In Smith's time he
has met you before.

40:06.362 --> 40:10.708
In your time you have met
him only once, in the hangar,

40:11.284 --> 40:14.788
which means you will go
back and meet him earlier.

40:18.333 --> 40:19.835
I spoke to him, Sherman.

40:20.168 --> 40:22.421
That was not a good idea.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.010
I didn't like talking
to him, Sherman.

40:29.260 --> 40:30.682
I didn't like it at all.

40:30.887 --> 40:32.480
You were not helping him.

40:33.306 --> 40:34.774
What's that supposed to mean?

40:35.308 --> 40:38.357
This seems to be my day
for spelling out the obvious.

40:38.853 --> 40:40.855
I suppose I should not complain.

40:42.065 --> 40:44.989
Come on, you old fraud,
prep me for the 1963 flight.

40:45.568 --> 40:48.242
<i>'63 mission
will proceed to stage one.</i>

40:48.446 --> 40:51.541
<i>The 63 mission will
proceed to stage one.</i>

40:52.825 --> 40:55.704
You did not smoke
enough, Louise.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.957
Give it to me straight,
doc, I can take it.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.589
No new degeneration.

41:02.627 --> 41:04.800
The levels of
complex hydrocarbons

41:05.004 --> 41:06.631
in your blood are depressed,

41:07.966 --> 41:09.843
due to breathing the
primordial atmosphere

41:10.051 --> 41:11.894
of the 20th century.

41:12.095 --> 41:13.295
They think their air is awful,

41:13.304 --> 41:15.398
they ain't seen nothin' yet.

41:15.932 --> 41:18.481
Maybe I should
replace those kidneys.

41:19.852 --> 41:21.946
Maybe a little kick,
get the ol' blood moving?

41:22.480 --> 41:24.858
Speed kills, my dear.

41:27.068 --> 41:28.991
<i>Uniform and
hair for lookalikes</i>

41:29.195 --> 41:31.072
<i>will proceed to stage two.</i>

41:31.280 --> 41:33.499
<i>Uniforms and hair for lookalikes</i>

41:33.700 --> 41:35.873
<i>will proceed to stage two.</i>

41:40.581 --> 41:42.709
Sometimes I think you
want me to live forever.

41:45.128 --> 41:48.758
Okay, so explain it to me.
It's what you were built for.

41:49.507 --> 41:50.679
You don't expect me to
know what's going on

41:50.883 --> 41:51.763
in my own head, do ya?

41:51.801 --> 41:52.848
Hardly.

41:53.094 --> 41:55.688
All right,
on a normal mission,

41:55.888 --> 41:58.562
when you are taking people
who are about to die

41:58.766 --> 42:02.441
off doomed airplanes you do
not mind treating them roughly.

42:02.895 --> 42:03.737
All done.

42:04.147 --> 42:05.569
It's 'cause I'm helping them.

42:05.898 --> 42:08.196
Obviously, without you,
those people would be dead.

42:08.401 --> 42:10.870
So you can function
without remorse.

42:11.237 --> 42:13.160
But with Smith
it was different.

42:13.906 --> 42:15.874
I don't think I want
to hear any more.

42:17.243 --> 42:18.916
How's the little
feather head today?

42:19.495 --> 42:21.213
Louise loves you,
Orville, yes, she does.

42:22.248 --> 42:24.376
Polly want a chemical
free sterilized cracker?

42:29.255 --> 42:33.010
I should take you to 1963.
You could fly.

42:38.014 --> 42:39.436
Would you like that?

42:39.891 --> 42:41.484
Huh, would you like that?

42:49.901 --> 42:52.745
You left Smith
helpless and confused,

42:52.945 --> 42:55.073
so there was pain in you.

42:58.493 --> 43:00.211
Alright, I felt
sorry for the bastard.

43:02.080 --> 43:04.299
But, I'd-a shot him if
it'd straighten things out.

43:04.582 --> 43:07.051
As Coventry said,
you did not have that choice.

43:08.044 --> 43:09.967
What choices do I have?

43:10.588 --> 43:13.057
You say I have to go back,
because he met me before.

43:13.299 --> 43:14.767
Yes.

43:15.676 --> 43:18.930
What if I don't go back?
What happens to the universe?

43:19.555 --> 43:20.852
You must go back.

43:21.557 --> 43:22.809
Where's my free will?

43:23.017 --> 43:24.644
Did you lose it?

43:25.228 --> 43:26.946
I will look around for it.

43:36.405 --> 43:37.952
This is awful.

43:39.033 --> 43:41.331
If you think that's bad,
take a look at this.

43:42.912 --> 43:46.416
We located the 1963
crash while you were away.

43:46.666 --> 43:48.714
It is likely you
will go tomorrow.

43:49.377 --> 43:51.050
How are you on the
idiom and history?

43:52.004 --> 43:53.365
I know it like
the back of my hand.

43:53.422 --> 43:54.765
Who was the U.S. president?

43:55.049 --> 43:56.141
Johnson.

43:57.552 --> 44:00.396
No, wait, uh,
he was assassinated by...

44:01.556 --> 44:02.603
Vito Corleone?

44:02.807 --> 44:03.899
Louise.

44:28.249 --> 44:30.877
We've talked about
quarks and antineutrinos,

44:31.544 --> 44:33.171
but what about people?

44:34.297 --> 44:37.221
It's quite a step from
demonstrating that

44:37.425 --> 44:41.305
subatomic particles can
travel backward through time,

44:41.512 --> 44:43.310
to saying that people can.

44:43.598 --> 44:46.351
What would be the result of
people travelling in time?

44:47.518 --> 44:50.818
For one thing,
paradoxes become possible.

44:51.731 --> 44:53.529
Say you build a time
machine, go back,

44:53.733 --> 44:56.236
and murder your father
when he was 10 years old.

44:57.904 --> 44:59.144
That means you were never born,

44:59.322 --> 45:01.825
and if you weren't how did
you build the time machine?

45:02.491 --> 45:05.165
It's the possibility of paradoxes
that make most people

45:05.369 --> 45:08.748
rule out time travel
by human beings.

45:09.957 --> 45:10.833
Still, why not?

45:11.918 --> 45:13.545
If you were careful
you could do it.

45:15.838 --> 45:18.808
You would not go back
to kill Adolf Hitler,

45:19.008 --> 45:20.351
much as you might like to.

45:21.636 --> 45:22.916
Because it would change history.

45:25.806 --> 45:27.808
The time traveler would
have to be careful,

45:28.851 --> 45:31.730
but he could do a
surprising number of things.

45:34.565 --> 45:35.942
He could observe, for one.

45:39.320 --> 45:40.867
Find out once and
for all who was

45:41.072 --> 45:43.495
on the grassy knoll
that day in Dallas.

45:44.659 --> 45:48.004
And he will know what
we can only guess at,

45:48.204 --> 45:51.925
that we are destroying the planet
we live on by complacency.

45:52.792 --> 45:54.419
He will have to
live with our legacy

45:54.627 --> 45:56.550
of pollution and acid rain.

45:57.088 --> 46:00.262
Our negligence today
is producing a world

46:00.466 --> 46:03.515
in which our children's
children will be barren,

46:03.719 --> 46:06.563
and the human race heading
towards extinction.

46:08.015 --> 46:09.608
He could also take things,

46:09.809 --> 46:11.686
providing they
wouldn't be missed.

46:11.894 --> 46:13.896
A cup of water from
the Pacific Ocean,

46:14.105 --> 46:16.449
a stone from the Grand Canyon.

46:17.858 --> 46:19.110
This may sound pointless...

46:21.195 --> 46:25.200
but sometimes very small
differences can be crucial.

46:26.367 --> 46:27.960
<i>The difference
between a dead man...</i>

46:29.412 --> 46:32.461
<i>and a man who's alive
can be very small.</i>

46:35.167 --> 46:38.296
What about a man
who is about to die,

46:39.755 --> 46:42.008
a man no one will
ever see alive again.

46:43.467 --> 46:46.346
<i>Stage three alert, all sections go.</i>

46:52.435 --> 46:56.315
This is the hard part about
looking for time travelers.

46:59.442 --> 47:01.035
They don't want to be found.

47:01.986 --> 47:04.205
You must look for them in
places where no one is,

47:05.948 --> 47:07.746
or where there are people

47:09.035 --> 47:11.959
no one will ever
see alive again.

47:19.128 --> 47:21.847
<i>All personnel
stand by for departure.</i>

47:38.731 --> 47:40.654
Go, go!

48:06.634 --> 48:08.807
<i>Gate attendants,
pick up new arrivals,</i>

48:09.011 --> 48:10.888
<i>pick up new arrivals.</i>

48:23.067 --> 48:24.159
<i>Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

48:24.360 --> 48:25.782
<i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

48:26.987 --> 48:29.866
<i>We are cruising at an
altitude of 31,000 feet,</i>

48:31.492 --> 48:33.494
<i>at a ground speed
of 460 miles per hour.</i>

48:34.036 --> 48:36.915
<i>If you look out the right side,
through the clouds,</i>

48:37.123 --> 48:38.796
<i>you can see the Finger Lakes.</i>

48:40.543 --> 48:44.173
<i>Our expected time of arrival
is on schedule at 4:30.</i>

48:44.755 --> 48:47.725
<i>So sit back and relax,
and enjoy the flight.</i>

49:15.119 --> 49:17.372
Alright, send the others.
Everything's nice and quiet.

49:17.580 --> 49:18.832
Let's keep it that way.

49:18.998 --> 49:21.342
<i>Gantry
operators prepare for arrival.</i>

49:21.542 --> 49:23.840
<i>Extreme radiation danger.</i>

49:25.004 --> 49:26.125
May I get you a pillow, sir?

49:26.255 --> 49:27.131
Sure.

49:36.056 --> 49:39.060
<i>Prepare holding pens
for arriving passengers.</i>

49:50.446 --> 49:52.073
I'm through up here.
What's up?

49:52.281 --> 49:53.828
Well, there's a
guy acting funny.

49:54.033 --> 49:56.035
He's watching us too close.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.217
Get up, hey!

50:07.755 --> 50:09.316
You're gonna take me
to see the captain.

50:10.216 --> 50:11.684
Sir, you can't shoot that.

50:12.426 --> 50:14.770
If you depressurize the
cabin you'll kill us all.

50:15.304 --> 50:17.181
Nobody gets hurt
if I see the captain.

50:29.610 --> 50:31.533
You stinking son of a bitch.

50:34.031 --> 50:35.203
Oof!

50:49.964 --> 50:51.966
Hey, wake up, get in
there and cork the crew.

50:52.174 --> 50:53.926
You know the flight plan.
Keep it steady.

50:56.053 --> 50:57.533
Alright, Squad Martin,
fast and dirty.

50:57.721 --> 50:59.143
This one's falling apart.

51:14.405 --> 51:15.952
Did that man shoot her?

51:17.199 --> 51:19.327
Don't worry, honey,
it's gonna be alright.

51:19.952 --> 51:21.329
When she fell-

51:21.537 --> 51:22.497
I want you to sleep now.

51:24.999 --> 51:27.343
<i>Attention, attention,</i>

51:27.918 --> 51:29.841
<i>initiation phase has commenced.</i>

51:30.754 --> 51:32.802
<i>All recovery team
personnel stand by.</i>

51:33.007 --> 51:35.180
63 flight in force field.

51:36.135 --> 51:38.934
<i>Holding, all systems engaged.</i>

51:39.555 --> 51:40.602
Ladies and gentlemen,

51:40.806 --> 51:42.934
please remain in your seats.

52:14.381 --> 52:15.849
Ladies and gentlemen,
please move

52:16.050 --> 52:17.427
toward the rear of the plane.

52:17.635 --> 52:19.308
Excuse me, would you mind
telling me what's going on?

52:19.511 --> 52:20.979
<i>Please step onto the raft,</i>

52:21.680 --> 52:24.524
<i>Walk quickly to the bottom,
and follow instructions.</i>

52:25.017 --> 52:26.519
<i>You will be taken
to a safety area.</i>

52:26.727 --> 52:27.444
Let's get you out of here.

52:27.645 --> 52:29.773
You idiot,
that's the survivor.

52:30.064 --> 52:31.657
Buckle him in and come
and help me with Susan.

52:31.857 --> 52:33.575
<i>Please step onto the ramp.</i>

52:33.776 --> 52:36.575
<i>Walk quickly to the bottom,
and follow instructions.</i>

52:37.112 --> 52:40.036
<i>You will be taken
to a safety area.</i>

52:43.911 --> 52:45.584
<i>Please step onto the ramp.</i>

52:46.330 --> 52:49.334
<i>Walk quickly to the bottom,
and follow instructions.</i>

52:49.750 --> 52:51.844
<i>You will be taken
to a safety area.</i>

52:56.256 --> 52:58.554
<i>Please step onto the ramp.</i>

53:08.894 --> 53:10.646
<i>All substitute
bodies will be placed</i>

53:10.854 --> 53:12.697
<i>strictly according to
the passenger list.</i>

53:13.941 --> 53:15.568
<i>Passengers now in transit.</i>

53:16.026 --> 53:18.950
<i>Prepare to activate
holding pen force fields.</i>

53:27.746 --> 53:30.124
So now we know a
hijacker caused this crash.

53:30.958 --> 53:32.585
We know there was a survivor.

53:33.293 --> 53:34.840
We know when it crashed.

53:36.547 --> 53:37.764
We just have to duplicate it.

53:38.507 --> 53:39.724
I stopped it.

53:41.385 --> 53:42.762
I stopped the bullet.

53:45.222 --> 53:46.769
You saved us all, kid.

53:50.436 --> 53:52.313
Hang in there,
you're gonna be all right.

53:53.897 --> 53:55.899
He must have fired
his gun in the cockpit.

53:58.235 --> 54:00.488
Have Djakarta attach a 5K
bomb to the wind screen.

54:00.696 --> 54:01.976
That should
duplicate the effect.

54:05.200 --> 54:06.292
I lost it.

54:08.495 --> 54:11.089
What, Susan?
what did you lose?

54:13.542 --> 54:14.464
Stun.

54:16.295 --> 54:20.675
Stunner, I lost the stunner.

54:36.690 --> 54:39.239
Look out!

54:43.989 --> 54:45.457
Stop it!
Hold the gate!

54:47.618 --> 54:48.790
Stop her.

54:48.994 --> 54:50.434
Baltimore, get out
of there, get out!

54:52.289 --> 54:53.962
No time, Louise, no time!

55:10.265 --> 55:12.017
Louise, there's a bomb.

55:46.009 --> 55:47.932
One of my team was shot.

55:48.595 --> 55:50.768
In the confusion,
a stunner was lost.

55:52.224 --> 55:54.067
It was too late to
go back and get it.

55:54.268 --> 55:55.869
You know the
prevention of paradox

55:56.061 --> 55:58.314
is more important
than individual lives.

55:58.772 --> 56:00.866
Blame is secondary
at this point.

56:01.191 --> 56:04.070
The first stunner you
lost in 1989 ended up

56:04.278 --> 56:06.406
briefly in the
possession of Bill Smith.

56:07.155 --> 56:09.203
He knows what it can do.

56:09.700 --> 56:13.671
Then you went back to 1963
and lost another stunner.

56:14.621 --> 56:15.998
The computers
estimate it wound up

56:16.206 --> 56:18.129
in the possession
of Arnold Mayer.

56:18.876 --> 56:21.595
If he learns what it can do,
he might be capable

56:21.795 --> 56:23.217
of learning how it works.

56:23.964 --> 56:27.764
The council has decided to
risk another mission to 1989.

56:28.635 --> 56:29.956
You must meet Smith
the day before

56:30.137 --> 56:31.855
you saw him in the hangar.

56:32.306 --> 56:34.729
You must prevent him
from going to that hangar

56:34.933 --> 56:36.480
the night he saw you there.

56:37.811 --> 56:39.813
Since he knew your
name when he saw you,

56:40.022 --> 56:42.616
he must have met you previously.

56:43.150 --> 56:45.744
Therefore, you did go back.

56:45.944 --> 56:47.537
Must go back.

57:00.125 --> 57:01.547
Seems I can't
get away from you.

57:01.960 --> 57:05.134
I would be a poor
personal robot if you could.

57:07.591 --> 57:10.140
I lost a very good girl
on that plane, Sherman.

57:11.845 --> 57:13.939
And what was the
council's epitaph for her?

57:14.348 --> 57:15.868
"Preventing a paradox
is more important

57:15.933 --> 57:17.401
"than individual lives."

57:18.435 --> 57:20.608
Susan knew that.
She accepted it.

57:23.398 --> 57:25.241
I just...

57:26.777 --> 57:28.199
I couldn't leave her.

57:29.154 --> 57:31.907
It is not necessary
to destroy your soul

57:32.115 --> 57:33.913
in this job, Louise.

57:34.910 --> 57:38.540
But a certain amount of
violence will be done to it.

57:41.416 --> 57:44.465
You made the wrong choice.

57:45.003 --> 57:48.803
It is easy for them to
make cold choices, Louise.

57:49.257 --> 57:52.306
They are hardly human anymore.

57:54.721 --> 57:56.348
Am I so different?

57:57.557 --> 57:59.901
We're all dying,
they're just a little further along.

58:01.061 --> 58:05.282
You are different.
You have feelings.

58:15.492 --> 58:16.869
They want me to go back again.

58:19.204 --> 58:21.206
You have to go back.

58:21.873 --> 58:24.342
He must be kept
out of that hangar.

58:25.085 --> 58:26.758
This isn't a job
for me, Sherman.

58:26.962 --> 58:29.215
You want somebody bashed
in the head, I'm your girl.

58:29.423 --> 58:32.552
You will have to
learn new methods.

58:34.428 --> 58:37.807
You can do it.
I know you can.

58:46.481 --> 58:47.607
Then let's go do it.

58:51.069 --> 58:52.366
Somebody's got
these guys working

58:52.571 --> 58:54.244
harder and faster
than I've ever seen.

58:54.448 --> 58:56.168
Well, that
DC-10 was pretty public.

58:56.324 --> 58:57.667
Spread itself over a
field not half a mile

58:57.868 --> 58:58.915
from the interstate.

58:59.119 --> 59:00.291
Right.

59:00.495 --> 59:02.247
They didn't want
people gawking at their...

59:02.456 --> 59:04.800
What was it they called
that crash in Florida?

59:05.292 --> 59:06.714
Involuntary conversion.

59:06.918 --> 59:07.840
I think they made
a profit on that

59:08.045 --> 59:09.422
when the insurance paid off.

59:09.629 --> 59:10.389
Well, they sure are

59:10.547 --> 59:12.174
busting their asses on this one.

59:12.466 --> 59:13.986
Take this coffee
over there, would you?

59:14.009 --> 59:15.352
Look at that,
they even got

59:15.552 --> 59:16.895
the ticket agents
serving coffee.

59:17.095 --> 59:19.223
Put that down,
just put that down!

59:19.931 --> 59:20.807
What do I do with this stuff?

59:21.016 --> 59:22.108
Did I tell you you
could touch that?

59:22.309 --> 59:23.310
Excuse me.

59:23.518 --> 59:25.771
Hey, how about some coffee?

59:30.901 --> 59:31.948
Hey, wait a minute.

59:37.157 --> 59:38.437
<i>Declaring an emergency;</i>

59:38.450 --> 59:39.793
<i>we hit another aircraft.</i>

59:41.036 --> 59:42.083
<i>Looked like a 10.</i>

59:42.579 --> 59:43.831
<i>Three and
four shutting down.</i>

59:43.997 --> 59:44.964
<i>Cutting fuel to three.</i>

59:45.457 --> 59:48.381
<i>We are going down,
repeat, going down.</i>

59:48.960 --> 59:50.132
<i>How much
of the wing is gone?</i>

59:50.337 --> 59:51.097
<i>Ron,
get back there.</i>

59:51.213 --> 59:51.714
<i>See how much we have left.</i>

59:51.922 --> 59:53.014
<i>Right.</i>

59:53.465 --> 59:54.466
Would you like some
coffee, Mr. Smith?

59:54.674 --> 59:56.114
after the senior
prom in high school.

59:56.593 --> 59:59.096
<i>Still going down.</i>
<i>Is there any place to</i> land?

59:59.304 --> 01:00:00.396
<i>I'll check.</i>

01:00:38.176 --> 01:00:39.928
Alright, Sherman,
he's seen me again.

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:42.014
I think he's interested.
What next?

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:46.525
What now, Sherman?

01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:49.111
Think of something.

01:00:50.021 --> 01:00:53.742
Take him to dinner,
someplace romantic.

01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:55.239
<i>How do I do that?</i>

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:57.328
Pick him up, my dear.

01:00:59.406 --> 01:01:00.658
How?

01:01:00.866 --> 01:01:03.961
<i>Drop your hankie,
wiggle your behind.</i>

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:08.378
You're the woman, Louise.
You figure it out.

01:01:09.457 --> 01:01:11.300
Just be subtle.

01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:15.259
Louise is about as
subtle as a lead pipe.

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:17.765
Thanks.

01:01:18.383 --> 01:01:20.761
<i>These should be
appropriate to the era,</i>

01:01:22.012 --> 01:01:24.936
<i>as well as stimulating
to the contemporary male.</i>

01:01:26.808 --> 01:01:28.481
<i>Sorry about the high heels.</i>

01:01:36.276 --> 01:01:38.404
<i>Standby
passenger D. Lawrence,</i>

01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:39.864
<i>report to Gate 17.</i>

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:42.498
<i>D. Lawrence to Gate 17.</i>

01:02:10.936 --> 01:02:14.736
<i>Standby passenger D.
Lawrence, report to Gate 17.</i>

01:02:15.023 --> 01:02:16.866
<i>D. Lawrence to Gate 17.</i>

01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:31.752
I keep running into you.

01:02:32.499 --> 01:02:34.126
If you're not running away.

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:35.991
I had to get out
of that hangar.

01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:37.366
I thought I was
going to be sick.

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:40.428
I guess you get used
to it after a while.

01:02:43.677 --> 01:02:45.179
Oh.

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:46.930
Excuse me.

01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:52.606
Well, we could be
stuck here for hours.

01:02:52.811 --> 01:02:54.358
Maybe we'd better
get acquainted.

01:03:08.994 --> 01:03:09.995
Taxi.

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:13.797
We could take my car.

01:03:14.374 --> 01:03:15.671
What kind of car do you drive?

01:03:16.668 --> 01:03:17.635
What kind?

01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:21.047
That's mine.

01:03:40.859 --> 01:03:42.361
Why don't you get in?

01:03:44.696 --> 01:03:45.948
You got the keys?

01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:48.575
Keys?

01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:27.368
Whoa!

01:04:29.324 --> 01:04:31.292
Tower clear you
for that takeoff?

01:04:38.416 --> 01:04:40.589
So, do you know Minneapolis?

01:04:40.919 --> 01:04:42.171
Nah, I've only been here-

01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:43.801
Watch it!

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:46.842
...a couple of times.

01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:49.644
Oh, I know a good place.

01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:51.137
Any place is fine.

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:53.765
Something wrong?

01:04:54.933 --> 01:04:56.105
Just watch it, Jesus!

01:04:58.937 --> 01:05:00.814
You really drive this thing.

01:05:08.988 --> 01:05:10.365
Are we almost there?

01:05:10.698 --> 01:05:12.621
Another two minutes
at this velocity.

01:05:16.663 --> 01:05:17.915
How long have
you had this car?

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:21.881
Oh, uh, forever.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.679
You must be the luckiest
woman in the world.

01:05:31.302 --> 01:05:32.929
Hey,
what are you doing?

01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:39.435
Idiot!

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:48.866
You alright?

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:51.824
I feel like I should
kiss the ground.

01:06:23.062 --> 01:06:25.941
Wow, can't get that anymore.

01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:27.533
I'll have another one.

01:06:28.276 --> 01:06:29.493
Forget the water.

01:06:29.777 --> 01:06:31.029
Can't get it anymore?

01:06:31.613 --> 01:06:33.160
It's old, but it's not that old.

01:06:34.365 --> 01:06:35.787
Oh, I mean I can't
usually afford-

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:37.289
Are you ready to order now?

01:06:39.454 --> 01:06:41.502
Bill, would you order for me?
I can never decide.

01:06:43.625 --> 01:06:47.425
Okay, the sole,
and tossed salad,

01:06:47.629 --> 01:06:49.347
and Italian dressing.

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:57.890
That's the first time I've
ordered for a girl since...

01:06:58.765 --> 01:07:00.358
after the senior
prom in high school.

01:07:01.935 --> 01:07:03.528
Did I act improperly?

01:07:03.895 --> 01:07:05.397
No.

01:07:05.939 --> 01:07:08.362
No, it's just... haven't you
ever heard of Women's Lib?

01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:12.161
The suffragette movement,
19th Amendment,

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:15.491
Rosie the Riveter, bra burning,
Gloria Steinem, ERA,

01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:18.247
the battle of the sexes.
Who won?

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:20.378
I think it's
still being fought.

01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:24.215
We might call a
truce for tonight.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.047
I'd like that.

01:07:28.294 --> 01:07:29.466
Who won?

01:07:31.798 --> 01:07:33.550
You have a strange
sense of humor.

01:07:35.009 --> 01:07:38.809
Sometimes it's like you
grew up in a foreign country.

01:07:39.931 --> 01:07:43.777
I did.
I grew up abroad, overseas.

01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:45.524
Whereabouts?

01:07:47.272 --> 01:07:48.398
France.

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:51.568
I'm from France, my
father was posted there.

01:07:52.151 --> 01:07:53.243
He was a warrior.

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:54.912
Soldier?

01:07:55.655 --> 01:07:57.623
That's right, a soldier.

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:01.002
Well, to France, then.

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:03.834
Excuse me, your table's
ready for you now.

01:08:40.408 --> 01:08:42.081
That's a real habit you got.

01:08:44.871 --> 01:08:46.247
What habit is that?

01:08:46.456 --> 01:08:48.834
I never seen anyone eat
and smoke at the same time.

01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:58.768
Where did it go?

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:01.169
If you hear someone scream,
that's probably where it is.

01:09:01.763 --> 01:09:04.642
Louise, you gotta quit.
The tobacco's ruining your brain.

01:09:19.197 --> 01:09:21.871
So you never remarried,
and don't have a girlfriend?

01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:24.417
Isn't that a little unusual?

01:09:25.078 --> 01:09:26.125
Is it?

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:27.960
I guess so.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.719
I don't know,
sometimes I wish I'd...

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:36.846
What?

01:09:38.131 --> 01:09:40.009
Done things
differently, I guess.

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:42.804
The job always came first.

01:09:44.889 --> 01:09:46.015
I know what you mean.

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:48.143
That's how I feel about my job.

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:49.819
Really?

01:09:50.103 --> 01:09:52.423
But yours doesn't take you away
in the middle of the night,

01:09:52.814 --> 01:09:54.532
keep you gone for
a couple of months?

01:09:55.942 --> 01:09:58.616
By the time I got back,
my girl had actually gone.

01:10:00.988 --> 01:10:02.831
Well, maybe you didn't
find the right girl.

01:10:04.951 --> 01:10:05.952
Maybe.

01:10:06.619 --> 01:10:07.962
Tom says I'm burning out.

01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:12.963
Whatever.

01:10:13.626 --> 01:10:15.094
I just gave up looking.

01:10:16.963 --> 01:10:18.761
Took a lot of cold showers.

01:10:23.928 --> 01:10:26.022
You find it difficult
to talk about yourself.

01:10:26.431 --> 01:10:28.274
That's all I've been doing.

01:10:33.104 --> 01:10:34.947
But you're right, I can't.

01:10:35.398 --> 01:10:36.775
Open up emotionally?

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:38.117
That's it.

01:10:39.026 --> 01:10:40.073
I'm no good at...

01:10:40.737 --> 01:10:41.909
Expressing yourself?

01:10:42.613 --> 01:10:44.160
I couldn't-a said
it better myself.

01:10:45.116 --> 01:10:46.538
What about you?

01:10:48.703 --> 01:10:50.205
Why aren't you married?

01:10:50.621 --> 01:10:52.339
I can't have any children.

01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:54.466
I'm sorry.

01:10:55.376 --> 01:10:57.504
But that's not the only
reason to get married.

01:10:58.838 --> 01:10:59.930
It would be for me.

01:11:03.509 --> 01:11:04.830
Bill, I'd like to
get out of here.

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:08.139
Where are you staying?
I can drive you there.

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:12.853
For a minute, I forgot.

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:15.855
I haven't even
seen the room yet.

01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:18.320
I was going to ask
you if it's nice.

01:11:20.443 --> 01:11:22.866
Well, you could come
up and take a look.

01:11:50.097 --> 01:11:51.223
It is nice.

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:55.778
At least they
delivered my luggage.

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:28.974
Compliments of the management.

01:12:29.929 --> 01:12:30.930
That's real nice.

01:12:33.099 --> 01:12:34.316
That is nice.

01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:40.447
Would you like an apple?

01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:10.435
What's so funny?

01:13:11.679 --> 01:13:14.398
I don't know, you just
seem to do everything

01:13:14.599 --> 01:13:16.567
a little different
from everyone else.

01:13:17.977 --> 01:13:19.069
Is that bad?

01:13:20.855 --> 01:13:22.448
I don't think so.

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:26.364
Let's find out.

01:13:37.872 --> 01:13:39.874
This may not have
been such a good idea.

01:13:41.667 --> 01:13:42.759
Why not?

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.842
You don't find me attractive?

01:13:46.047 --> 01:13:47.424
Nah, it's not that, I just...

01:13:48.215 --> 01:13:51.264
Wait, try it again.

01:13:53.638 --> 01:13:56.517
Please, I really
want this to work.

01:13:58.643 --> 01:14:00.111
I really need this to work.

01:14:58.119 --> 01:14:59.666
Let me get the light.

01:15:01.539 --> 01:15:02.916
To hell with the light.

01:15:45.958 --> 01:15:47.358
There's a spare
toothbrush in there,

01:15:47.501 --> 01:15:48.844
if that's what
you're looking for.

01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:52.515
I thought
you were sleeping.

01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:55.518
I think I was.

01:16:06.437 --> 01:16:07.529
Come here.

01:16:26.123 --> 01:16:27.875
You smoke too much.

01:16:34.882 --> 01:16:36.350
I'll quit tomorrow.

01:16:37.301 --> 01:16:38.803
Just like that, huh?

01:16:41.972 --> 01:16:45.442
I've heard that story before.
Took me over a year to quit.

01:16:47.394 --> 01:16:48.395
You don't believe me?

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:51.069
This is my last cigarette.

01:17:00.116 --> 01:17:01.868
Damn it, they were
supposed to call me.

01:17:03.911 --> 01:17:05.788
Well, they can't start
'till you get there.

01:17:11.502 --> 01:17:13.596
Bill, you remember we
were talking about fate?

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:16.511
Sure, I remember.

01:17:16.715 --> 01:17:18.683
Maybe that's why
they didn't call you.

01:17:23.889 --> 01:17:25.266
Are you listening to me?

01:17:27.852 --> 01:17:28.899
I don't get it.

01:17:31.689 --> 01:17:33.282
This job is wearing you down.

01:17:34.608 --> 01:17:35.860
I know it is.

01:17:36.235 --> 01:17:38.112
I can't just walk
away from it, Louise.

01:17:39.238 --> 01:17:40.785
Why not?

01:17:41.448 --> 01:17:43.792
The world's not gonna come to
an end if you just walk away.

01:17:45.202 --> 01:17:48.627
I haven't had a vacation in
six years, I got one coming.

01:17:51.417 --> 01:17:53.761
In one week I'll have
this investigation started,

01:17:53.961 --> 01:17:55.759
and I can hand it
over to someone else.

01:17:56.839 --> 01:17:59.513
Then I'm gonna take a
long look at my life.

01:18:01.594 --> 01:18:03.596
Maybe we can go away
somewhere together.

01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:07.308
Anyway, we got tonight.

01:18:08.601 --> 01:18:10.148
I may not be here tonight.

01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:26.202
Stay with me.

01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:35.677
I can't.

01:18:51.518 --> 01:18:53.771
We'll talk about it tonight.

01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:06.834
Sherman, send the gate.

01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:27.142
Louise?

01:19:48.701 --> 01:19:50.874
<i>Gate's
operation is terminated.</i>

01:19:52.037 --> 01:19:54.085
<i>All controls to zero.</i>

01:20:00.713 --> 01:20:01.930
Hmm.

01:20:03.882 --> 01:20:05.008
He'll never miss it.

01:20:05.759 --> 01:20:06.885
What happened?

01:20:07.678 --> 01:20:08.895
Did you stop him?

01:20:09.471 --> 01:20:10.814
Sherman, get my uniform.

01:20:11.015 --> 01:20:13.939
<i>Paradox, time quake
approaching, force seven.</i>

01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:31.877
I have to talk to the council.
We don't have much time.

01:20:35.289 --> 01:20:37.132
Here's what happened
after I left.

01:20:40.044 --> 01:20:42.923
<i>...going over every single
piece of wreckage in this hangar.</i>

01:20:43.964 --> 01:20:45.932
<i>Identify it, tag it.</i>

01:20:46.967 --> 01:20:49.007
<i>If you don't know what
something is, bring it to me.</i>

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:51.005
<i>What is it we're looking for?</i>

01:20:51.138 --> 01:20:52.560
<i>I'll know it when I see it.</i>

01:20:53.807 --> 01:20:56.811
<i>We're gonna reassemble the
747 from the ground up.</i>

01:20:57.353 --> 01:20:58.479
<i>Bill, are you sure of this?</i>

01:20:58.687 --> 01:20:59.984
<i>That's all.
Go to work.</i>

01:21:02.107 --> 01:21:04.280
He's forgotten all about
what really caused the crash.

01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:06.988
Now he's looking
for the stunner.

01:21:09.198 --> 01:21:10.290
And for me.

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:29.347
We're wasting time, Bill.

01:21:29.843 --> 01:21:31.937
Can't learn anything from this.

01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:34.147
Rebuild it.

01:21:34.973 --> 01:21:36.475
Every inch of it.

01:21:38.644 --> 01:21:40.988
Day and night,
I'll approve the overtime.

01:21:57.913 --> 01:22:00.666
Bill, the boss is on the
phone from Washington.

01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:02.718
<i>Tell him I'll call him back.</i>

01:22:03.710 --> 01:22:06.054
<i>He says get yourself back
there or you'll be fired.</i>

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:10.183
Well, that sounds
fairly urgent.

01:22:11.844 --> 01:22:12.936
You want me to go with you?

01:22:13.137 --> 01:22:14.810
I don't think you'd
better be around me.

01:22:15.013 --> 01:22:16.811
It might not be good
for your career.

01:22:18.267 --> 01:22:19.769
He's doing his job badly now.

01:22:19.977 --> 01:22:22.275
It had to lead to conflict
with his superiors.

01:22:24.022 --> 01:22:25.524
<i>Bill,
I've always backed you,</i>

01:22:25.732 --> 01:22:27.359
<i>because you were a
good investigator.</i>

01:22:28.694 --> 01:22:32.164
<i>I let you run with this even
if I couldn't see the reason,</i>

01:22:32.406 --> 01:22:34.124
<i>but you've turned
up nothing new.</i>

01:22:35.367 --> 01:22:38.041
Now, I have to know
what you expect to find.

01:22:38.245 --> 01:22:40.873
If I knew, I wouldn't
have to look so hard for it.

01:22:43.917 --> 01:22:48.093
This crash has been
crazy from the start.

01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:52.013
Like, the watches
that ran backwards.

01:22:53.427 --> 01:22:55.521
You said that
wasn't important.

01:22:56.847 --> 01:22:58.645
I didn't think so.
Now I do.

01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:01.818
And the cockpit tape.

01:23:03.187 --> 01:23:05.986
The engineer screaming that
they're all dead and burned.

01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:08.409
Was it computer error, or not?

01:23:11.904 --> 01:23:12.905
Yeah.

01:23:14.907 --> 01:23:16.547
As soon as we get your
report saying that,

01:23:16.742 --> 01:23:18.422
we can recommend getting
the new computers.

01:23:19.286 --> 01:23:20.913
That's a big appropriation,

01:23:21.079 --> 01:23:23.081
and Congress is ready
to spend the money.

01:23:30.464 --> 01:23:33.343
Something happened
in the hangar.

01:23:35.219 --> 01:23:36.641
I found something.

01:23:39.348 --> 01:23:40.941
I think it knocked me out.

01:23:43.936 --> 01:23:46.359
Then they came and
took it from me.

01:23:50.317 --> 01:23:51.910
Now they're watching me.

01:23:53.779 --> 01:23:54.780
I can feel it.

01:23:59.159 --> 01:24:00.752
They can go anywhere.

01:24:02.913 --> 01:24:04.039
Look anywhere.

01:24:08.502 --> 01:24:10.800
<i>There was this girl.</i>

01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:36.618
Now he'll go see Dr. Mayer.

01:24:38.115 --> 01:24:39.662
Dr. Mayer doesn't
have the answers.

01:24:40.784 --> 01:24:42.206
But he has one of these.

01:24:42.578 --> 01:24:44.751
It's the stunner
Susan lost in 1963.

01:24:45.706 --> 01:24:47.003
Smith has the initiator.

01:24:47.207 --> 01:24:50.051
You put them together,
and it spells paradox.

01:25:00.679 --> 01:25:03.933
Come in, Mr. Smith.
I've been expecting you.

01:25:05.976 --> 01:25:08.855
That's it, it's all temporal
censorship from there.

01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:13.942
That means I will go back.

01:25:14.526 --> 01:25:17.530
I can still stop the paradox
if I leave right now.

01:25:20.490 --> 01:25:22.091
The watches,
the cockpit voice recording,

01:25:22.284 --> 01:25:23.964
that could be important.
It's hard to tell,

01:25:24.036 --> 01:25:25.333
but you say she
didn't know you.

01:25:26.705 --> 01:25:28.878
That's right, she said
I look like my pictures.

01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:32.294
Then she hadn't met you yet.

01:25:32.628 --> 01:25:34.722
I told you, we spent
the night together.

01:25:36.673 --> 01:25:37.799
It was unforgettable.

01:25:38.008 --> 01:25:39.134
You're missing the point.

01:25:39.343 --> 01:25:41.463
She finds you in the hangar
on the night of the fifth.

01:25:42.054 --> 01:25:44.273
She returns to wherever
she comes from,

01:25:45.557 --> 01:25:47.355
then, for reasons of her own,

01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:50.438
she returns to the
fourth and meets you...

01:25:52.564 --> 01:25:54.487
for the first time,
from her point of view.

01:25:56.693 --> 01:25:58.445
She's travelling in time.

01:26:02.282 --> 01:26:04.159
There has to be
another answer.

01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:08.588
It's time I showed
you something.

01:26:10.957 --> 01:26:13.756
I've been working on
a puzzle for 25 years.

01:26:16.797 --> 01:26:18.674
You may be the missing piece.

01:26:18.924 --> 01:26:20.471
That's it!
Where'd you get it?

01:26:22.302 --> 01:26:23.349
What is it?

01:26:23.553 --> 01:26:24.805
It's a weapon of some kind.

01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:28.017
<i>All systems green,
quadrants interlocked.</i>

01:26:28.975 --> 01:26:30.522
<i>All systems go.</i>

01:26:30.936 --> 01:26:33.280
<i>Two minutes, Baltimore, solo,</i>

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:35.949
<i>1989, two minutes.</i>

01:26:37.901 --> 01:26:39.574
All I want to do is find her.

01:26:41.655 --> 01:26:43.498
I don't care about
anything else.

01:26:44.616 --> 01:26:46.744
Bill, I think
you'll see her again.

01:26:48.912 --> 01:26:50.380
How do you know
so much about her?

01:26:50.747 --> 01:26:54.001
Because of this object.
It's very important.

01:27:00.465 --> 01:27:02.513
I've run tests on
it over the years.

01:27:02.718 --> 01:27:03.765
I still don't know
what it's made of,

01:27:03.969 --> 01:27:05.609
and we can't make one
in the 20th century.

01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:07.602
Where'd you get it?

01:27:07.931 --> 01:27:09.729
It was in the wreckage
of a 707 that crashed

01:27:09.933 --> 01:27:11.981
in upstate New York in 1963.

01:27:25.198 --> 01:27:26.791
I was on that plane.

01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:31.838
That can't be; the only
survivor was a boy named-

01:27:32.122 --> 01:27:33.590
William Collins.

01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:36.259
My mother remarried
and I took the name.

01:27:40.088 --> 01:27:41.761
This is incredible.

01:27:44.342 --> 01:27:45.559
Then you must...

01:27:47.012 --> 01:27:48.434
What do you remember?

01:27:50.974 --> 01:27:52.095
I don't think about it much.

01:27:52.184 --> 01:27:53.936
You must remember something.

01:28:00.484 --> 01:28:02.407
I don't remember
the crash at all.

01:28:04.946 --> 01:28:08.041
Before that,
people were shouting.

01:28:10.494 --> 01:28:11.711
Somebody got shot.

01:28:11.912 --> 01:28:13.380
They found a gun
with one shot fired.

01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:14.980
It was a mental
patient, a hijacker.

01:28:16.875 --> 01:28:17.922
There was this lady.

01:28:32.182 --> 01:28:33.434
It was her.

01:28:35.894 --> 01:28:37.362
I remember now.

01:28:38.438 --> 01:28:40.190
She told me everything
would be all right.

01:28:40.398 --> 01:28:41.741
She knew you'd survive.

01:28:43.318 --> 01:28:45.366
But what about her, why
didn't she die in the crash?

01:28:45.737 --> 01:28:48.456
She got off some way,
but she left this behind.

01:28:48.657 --> 01:28:49.909
She'll be wanting it back.

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:51.626
After 25 years?

01:28:51.827 --> 01:28:54.068
In our time, but in her time,
she just lost it yesterday.

01:28:54.204 --> 01:28:55.706
This is the key, Bill.

01:28:55.956 --> 01:28:57.674
It's something that
shouldn't be here.

01:28:57.874 --> 01:28:59.968
We're living in her past.
If she changes her past,

01:29:00.168 --> 01:29:02.637
if she creates a paradox,
then her world is destroyed.

01:29:02.838 --> 01:29:05.591
Oh yes, we'll be seeing
more of Louise Baltimore.

01:29:07.926 --> 01:29:10.270
<i>Laser beams,
prepare for countdown.</i>

01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:14.896
<i>Time tolls intermittent at six seconds,
five, four, three...</i>

01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:16.898
I may not make it back.

01:29:17.727 --> 01:29:19.400
You will be back.

01:29:19.604 --> 01:29:22.073
<i>...one.
All systems green.</i>

01:29:22.274 --> 01:29:25.369
<i>30 seconds, Baltimore, solo,</i>

01:29:25.569 --> 01:29:28.163
<i>1989, 30 seconds.</i>

01:29:28.655 --> 01:29:30.282
This came off mine.

01:29:42.919 --> 01:29:45.200
You two know too much already,
and I don't have much time,

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:46.860
but I'll try to
answer your questions.

01:29:47.257 --> 01:29:49.055
Dr. Mayer, I'll
have to take that.

01:29:49.634 --> 01:29:52.137
You take people off planes
just before they crash.

01:29:54.097 --> 01:29:56.566
We replace what we
take with dead bodies.

01:29:59.477 --> 01:30:01.195
I'm glad you came back.

01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:26.338
But the relatives
identify them.

01:30:28.548 --> 01:30:30.550
They identify
the wrong people.

01:30:31.676 --> 01:30:33.644
We duplicate them,
fingerprints, dental records.

01:30:34.346 --> 01:30:35.848
We're very good at what we do.

01:30:37.807 --> 01:30:39.184
Then you are from the future.

01:30:41.478 --> 01:30:43.321
About 1000 years.

01:30:47.776 --> 01:30:49.153
It must be incredible.

01:30:51.821 --> 01:30:53.164
It must be horrible.

01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:54.957
It's awful.

01:30:55.825 --> 01:30:57.042
We're all dying.

01:30:57.702 --> 01:31:00.080
We can make the bodies,
but we can't make the souls.

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:03.212
We can't have children anymore.

01:31:04.084 --> 01:31:05.427
We steal people from the past

01:31:05.627 --> 01:31:07.550
to send them somewhere
else to start over.

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:12.096
To give them a second chance.

01:31:15.512 --> 01:31:17.552
I have to take that stunner
back with me, Dr. Mayer.

01:31:17.639 --> 01:31:18.856
It could cause a paradox.

01:31:20.517 --> 01:31:21.985
I'm going with you.

01:31:23.144 --> 01:31:24.487
You can't, Bill.

01:31:24.688 --> 01:31:26.009
Haven't you heard
anything I said?

01:31:26.731 --> 01:31:29.280
You said you were dying.
So am I.

01:31:30.402 --> 01:31:32.746
Bill, the whole race is
dying, all of humanity.

01:31:34.030 --> 01:31:35.156
We're all gonna die.

01:31:36.074 --> 01:31:37.542
What matters is now.

01:31:38.034 --> 01:31:39.502
This moment.

01:31:42.539 --> 01:31:44.837
I can't take anything
with me that will be missed.

01:31:45.125 --> 01:31:46.877
No one's gonna miss me.

01:31:52.215 --> 01:31:54.638
The stunner, Dr. Mayer,
that's what I came for.

01:32:00.557 --> 01:32:02.275
I knew I was right.

01:32:05.103 --> 01:32:06.025
No!

01:32:17.073 --> 01:32:18.074
He's dead.

01:32:21.953 --> 01:32:23.796
The paradox has happened.

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:26.758
I gotta get outta here.

01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:31.763
Take me with you.

01:32:36.676 --> 01:32:37.928
Sherman, send the gate.

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:48.063
Watch that first step.
It's a killer.

01:32:53.526 --> 01:32:56.905
<i>Paradox,
time quake, force infinity.</i>

01:32:58.531 --> 01:33:01.956
<i>Paradox, time quake,
force infinity.</i>

01:33:08.124 --> 01:33:10.468
Mr. Smith, I presume.

01:33:20.762 --> 01:33:22.309
Come on.

01:33:38.363 --> 01:33:40.483
Mayer's work would have
changed the course of history.

01:33:40.907 --> 01:33:42.909
He wasn't supposed
to die for six years.

01:33:43.118 --> 01:33:44.870
I tried to stop him.
I was too late.

01:33:45.662 --> 01:33:48.256
It's all over.
The paradox is here.

01:33:50.041 --> 01:33:51.201
If you had left things alone,

01:33:51.292 --> 01:33:52.572
none of this would
have happened.

01:33:53.503 --> 01:33:55.050
I did what I had to do.

01:33:55.255 --> 01:33:57.416
<i>Our world is at an end.</i>

01:33:57.590 --> 01:34:00.764
<i>All evidence of our existence
will be washed away.</i>

01:34:00.969 --> 01:34:03.518
<i>We must attempt to send
those We have saved</i>

01:34:03.721 --> 01:34:06.725
<i>into a distant future that
may lie beyond the gate.</i>

01:34:10.228 --> 01:34:14.153
Coventry,
reverse the gate.

01:34:19.279 --> 01:34:20.496
Get out.

01:34:21.239 --> 01:34:22.912
Get out,
everybody get out!

01:34:24.117 --> 01:34:25.334
Go, Louise.

01:34:27.996 --> 01:34:29.248
Get him out of here.

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:52.733
Open the holding pens.

01:34:54.147 --> 01:34:57.276
Release everyone and
send them to the gate.

01:34:58.318 --> 01:35:00.241
<i>You will awake now.</i>

01:35:04.657 --> 01:35:07.001
<i>Remain calm
Remain calm.</i>

01:35:07.202 --> 01:35:08.402
- Come on!
- Come on, let's go.

01:36:01.756 --> 01:36:04.555
<i>Proceed to the gate
as quickly as possible.</i>

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:08.764
<i>Proceed in single file
to the main terminal.</i>

01:36:08.972 --> 01:36:10.895
<i>Remain calm.</i>

01:36:11.557 --> 01:36:14.777
<i>Do not be afraid.
Do not be afraid.</i>

01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:16.943
<i>No harm will come to you.</i>

01:36:17.313 --> 01:36:18.781
<i>Follow directions.</i>

01:36:30.535 --> 01:36:32.287
<i>Walk towards the light,</i>

01:36:32.495 --> 01:36:34.042
<i>and step into the light.</i>

01:36:36.624 --> 01:36:37.876
Move along.

01:36:40.044 --> 01:36:41.887
Move along,
everything's all right.

01:36:43.089 --> 01:36:45.387
Please remain calm.

01:37:04.986 --> 01:37:07.284
Single file,
walk into the light.

01:37:10.742 --> 01:37:12.665
You'll be all right.
Keep movin'.

01:37:13.870 --> 01:37:15.622
Single file,
walk into the light.

01:37:16.956 --> 01:37:18.629
<i>Walk towards the light,</i>

01:37:18.833 --> 01:37:20.551
<i>and step into the light.</i>

01:37:36.642 --> 01:37:37.894
Our work is done.

01:37:41.898 --> 01:37:43.525
I move we adjourn.

01:37:44.776 --> 01:37:46.073
Seconded.

01:37:51.949 --> 01:37:53.997
Just keep moving,
walk through the light.

01:37:54.952 --> 01:37:56.078
Walk into the light.

01:38:25.108 --> 01:38:26.405
Time to go, Bill.

01:38:30.405 --> 01:38:33.033
<i>The gate will be
destroyed in two minutes.</i>

01:38:33.241 --> 01:38:34.993
What happens when
the gate's gone?

01:38:35.201 --> 01:38:36.794
Like a nuclear bomb.

01:38:49.090 --> 01:38:50.558
Step through, Bill.

01:38:55.847 --> 01:38:56.814
Together.

01:38:59.851 --> 01:39:02.775
None of us can go,
only you.

01:39:05.314 --> 01:39:06.907
Then I'm not goin', either.

01:39:10.486 --> 01:39:12.830
Take a chance, Louise.

01:39:14.198 --> 01:39:15.700
Go with him.

01:39:17.118 --> 01:39:19.746
You are going to have his child.

01:39:30.882 --> 01:39:34.182
<i>The gate will be
destroyed in one minute.</i>

01:39:44.645 --> 01:39:46.147
Sherman, come with us.

01:39:47.607 --> 01:39:50.611
There is no place for
me where you are going.

01:39:53.905 --> 01:39:55.873
Go, now.

01:40:28.856 --> 01:40:30.950
<i>This is not the end.</i>

01:40:43.871 --> 01:40:46.670
<i>This is not the
beginning of the end.</i>

01:40:49.877 --> 01:40:52.756
<i>It is the end of the beginning.</i>
