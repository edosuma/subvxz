00:05.169 --> 00:07.072
Previously on Rectify...

00:07.073 --> 00:09.518
I've given up pretty much
everything except for hormones.

00:09.519 --> 00:11.044
I have no idea at this time as
to what it is that I am doing.

00:11.045 --> 00:12.587
We could start a club.

00:12.588 --> 00:15.575
- He wants to buy the store.
- Huh.

00:15.902 --> 00:17.792
Can I get you anything by now?

00:17.793 --> 00:19.120
My plaque.

00:19.767 --> 00:21.341
Your client plead guilty.

00:21.342 --> 00:23.603
Because he was too afraid
of going back to prison.

00:24.357 --> 00:26.171
You think you see him again?

00:26.172 --> 00:28.571
- We're going huntin' this weekend.
- Hunting?

00:28.572 --> 00:32.228
We feel that additional therapy
will increase your chances of...

00:32.229 --> 00:34.820
Becoming an upstanding citizen?

00:53.332 --> 00:56.233
Ouch!

01:03.141 --> 01:04.693
Morning, sunshine.

01:06.584 --> 01:08.853
It might be mornin', but
there's no sunshine.

01:08.854 --> 01:10.620
Will be in an hour or so.

01:10.621 --> 01:14.525
Look, I was kind of
drunk when I said I'd go.

01:14.526 --> 01:17.561
Okay. Suit yourself.

01:17.562 --> 01:18.763
What are you doin'?

01:19.103 --> 01:20.662
Goin' huntin'.

01:21.703 --> 01:23.302
Wait.

01:24.903 --> 01:27.437
I just like to bitch a
little before daylight.

01:27.438 --> 01:29.473
- So, you're going with me?
- Yes.

01:29.474 --> 01:34.744
I just... need a minute to
find my matching camo wear.

01:34.745 --> 01:35.691
All right.

01:36.882 --> 01:37.915
I'll be in the truck.

01:39.036 --> 01:40.653
A'ight.

01:53.398 --> 01:55.635
You're up early.

01:57.603 --> 02:00.570
You need to do something to me?

02:00.571 --> 02:02.305
No.

02:02.306 --> 02:05.509
No, I-I just wondered if I
could get you anything.

02:05.510 --> 02:07.545
No.

02:07.546 --> 02:09.947
You can't get me anything...

02:09.948 --> 02:11.883
or won't.

02:14.590 --> 02:15.817
I'm sorry.

02:16.845 --> 02:17.947
For what?

02:20.024 --> 02:21.459
Life...

02:21.460 --> 02:22.827
I guess.

02:24.796 --> 02:27.222
You're a good girl.

02:28.099 --> 02:31.069
Say your prayers, you'll be all right.

02:33.202 --> 02:35.919
Does Mr. Zeke
have many visitors?

02:35.920 --> 02:38.542
Not really. Why?

02:38.543 --> 02:40.312
Um...

02:43.681 --> 02:47.685
He wants his plaque from the Ford plant.

02:48.401 --> 02:49.519
Okay.

02:49.520 --> 02:52.390
And he said his nearest living relative

02:52.391 --> 02:53.959
is his nephew in Arizona.

02:54.918 --> 02:55.993
Okay.

02:55.994 --> 02:58.696
Could... Could we maybe go get it?

02:58.697 --> 03:00.064
Absolutely not.

03:00.065 --> 03:02.433
There would be liability
issues up the wazoo,

03:02.434 --> 03:04.737
and that is a quick way for
somebody to get fired.

03:05.709 --> 03:06.803
I wasn't sure.

03:06.804 --> 03:07.905
Well, now you are.

03:08.514 --> 03:09.773
Could I call his nephew?

03:09.774 --> 03:12.042
No, you cannot call anyone.

03:12.043 --> 03:14.011
That information is confidential,

03:14.012 --> 03:16.012
and you are still an aide, Tawney.

03:16.013 --> 03:16.924
I know.

03:18.533 --> 03:20.552
He just wants his plaque.

03:21.220 --> 03:23.132
That's all he wants in the whole world.

03:25.357 --> 03:27.357
Look...

03:27.358 --> 03:29.993
Let me just get into the whole...

03:29.994 --> 03:32.376
plaque nephew thing, okay?

03:32.377 --> 03:33.664
Yes, sir.

03:33.665 --> 03:34.934
Thank you.

03:38.133 --> 03:39.398
Hey, Tawney?

03:39.838 --> 03:41.505
Yes, sir.

03:41.506 --> 03:43.606
It's not good to get too
personally involved

03:43.607 --> 03:44.742
with residents.

03:45.309 --> 03:46.370
I know.

03:46.807 --> 03:48.413
Just trying to help.

03:50.167 --> 03:51.760
But I-I hear you.

04:22.879 --> 04:25.804
<b><font color="#ff0000">Sync and corrections by btsix
www.addic7ed.com</font></b>

04:29.855 --> 04:31.923
What was all that about this morning?

04:32.626 --> 04:34.992
I thinks she went hunting with Billy.

04:34.993 --> 04:36.594
Amantha?

04:36.595 --> 04:37.894
Evidently.

04:37.895 --> 04:39.899
Huh.

04:41.529 --> 04:42.934
Teddy set for the meeting?

04:43.351 --> 04:44.636
Said he'd be there.

04:45.394 --> 04:46.667
That's the right call.

04:46.668 --> 04:48.487
I think so.

04:49.224 --> 04:52.543
No matter what Mr. Childers
says regarding the store,

04:53.143 --> 04:55.412
I'm still going up to
see Daniel on Friday.

04:58.482 --> 04:59.909
Did you hear me?

05:02.952 --> 05:04.557
I'd like to go with you.

05:06.558 --> 05:07.793
Help drive, you know?

05:08.458 --> 05:10.094
I can manage, really.

05:10.970 --> 05:12.763
I won't be in the way.

05:12.764 --> 05:14.600
Give y'all your space and everything.

05:15.007 --> 05:16.534
I don't know.

05:17.436 --> 05:21.478
I'd really like to talk
to him, Janet, in person.

05:22.979 --> 05:24.578
Try to make things...

05:25.686 --> 05:26.811
better.

05:26.812 --> 05:31.614
That's thoughtful, Ted,
but I, I mean,

05:31.615 --> 05:35.218
Daniel would have to be
comfortable with it, above all.

05:35.219 --> 05:36.528
Of course.

05:39.275 --> 05:41.330
I could reach out to him if you want.

05:42.699 --> 05:45.731
Let's get through
this meeting first.

05:59.241 --> 06:01.312
What's rattling around in that brain?

06:04.369 --> 06:08.085
W-When I first started
riding in cars again,

06:08.086 --> 06:10.110
I-I would fall asleep.

06:11.188 --> 06:12.823
I guess it was the motion.

06:12.824 --> 06:13.816
I don't know.

06:15.385 --> 06:17.062
That's curious.

06:20.748 --> 06:24.325
Will he, uh, be there at the property?

06:24.326 --> 06:25.169
No.

06:25.170 --> 06:26.908
His guy Rick will be there.

06:27.606 --> 06:31.608
I don't think he's there much, if ever.

06:32.077 --> 06:34.557
It's his third or fourth house.

06:35.180 --> 06:37.450
For family and friends
when they're in town.

06:38.756 --> 06:40.117
That's nice.

06:40.118 --> 06:42.252
Have you ever heard his music?

06:42.253 --> 06:44.054
Not that I'm aware of.

06:44.055 --> 06:45.458
It's popular.

06:58.536 --> 07:00.104
You're late.

07:00.747 --> 07:02.973
Pretty good, Rick. How are you?

07:02.974 --> 07:04.841
I got to get a fresh t-shirt

07:04.842 --> 07:08.011
over to an ATV park near Franklin ASAP.

07:08.012 --> 07:09.514
Okay.

07:10.641 --> 07:12.016
He pay for that?

07:12.017 --> 07:13.486
He did, yeah.

07:14.627 --> 07:16.287
Okay, so how... how long you gonna be?

07:16.288 --> 07:18.556
Aren't we supposed to take
some things back, too?

07:18.557 --> 07:19.989
Right. Shit.

07:19.990 --> 07:21.824
Got to pack 'em up to travel.

07:21.825 --> 07:23.694
Come on, really?

07:23.695 --> 07:25.061
Yes, Rick.

07:25.062 --> 07:26.896
If we're gonna auction
the donated pieces,

07:26.897 --> 07:28.331
they can't literally be in pieces.

07:28.332 --> 07:29.566
I can get it.

07:32.337 --> 07:35.071
Hey.

07:35.072 --> 07:37.142
Yeah, yeah, she's here right now.

07:37.952 --> 07:38.975
Yeah.

07:38.976 --> 07:40.779
Yeah, I know the shirt.

07:43.180 --> 07:45.848
What does "ATV" mean?

07:45.849 --> 07:47.951
All-terrain vehicle.

07:47.952 --> 07:49.621
Like a Bronco?

07:51.188 --> 07:53.723
Definitely not like a Bronco.

07:53.724 --> 07:56.193
Well, what's the purpose
of a Bronco then?

07:56.194 --> 07:58.896
Well, it's mostly to pick up girls.

07:58.897 --> 08:00.598
Hide what caste you're in.

08:00.599 --> 08:01.331
Cast?

08:01.332 --> 08:02.635
With an "E."

08:05.103 --> 08:06.737
Is Rick like an untouchable?

08:08.038 --> 08:09.926
Yeah, for anybody with taste.

08:10.829 --> 08:12.675
You're a bad girl, Chloe.

08:12.676 --> 08:13.744
Flatterer.

08:17.748 --> 08:20.818
Must've got caught in the
Paulie rush hour or something.

08:20.819 --> 08:22.319
Should we call him?

08:22.320 --> 08:24.787
- Yeah, maybe so.
- I wouldn't.

08:24.788 --> 08:25.674
Why not?

08:25.675 --> 08:27.323
Don't want to let him see us sweat.

08:27.324 --> 08:28.658
I don't think we're sweating.

08:28.659 --> 08:29.860
Psychologically.

08:31.396 --> 08:33.414
I talked to my gal at
Kathy Kitt's Realty,

08:33.416 --> 08:34.986
on the down low.

08:35.366 --> 08:38.235
- She ran some numbers for us.
- What does that mean?

08:38.236 --> 08:40.671
- What does what mean?
- Ran some numbers.

08:41.258 --> 08:43.139
Oh, it's just how they
get a ballpark figure

08:43.140 --> 08:44.307
of a, you know, fair offer.

08:44.308 --> 08:45.975
Get comparables and whatnot.

08:45.976 --> 08:48.912
I understand the colloquial
meaning attached to it.

08:48.913 --> 08:50.179
I just don't know why.

08:50.180 --> 08:52.682
Why they say "ran the numbers."

08:52.683 --> 08:55.720
Sounds like someone trained
digits to do parlor tricks.

08:58.156 --> 08:59.889
I just think it's a dumb expression.

08:59.890 --> 09:01.124
That's all.

09:01.125 --> 09:02.371
Okay.

09:02.861 --> 09:05.763
Well, anyway, the point is,

09:05.764 --> 09:08.065
Gilda at Kathy Kitt's Realty thinks

09:08.066 --> 09:09.767
that if Mr. Childers is representing

09:09.768 --> 09:12.869
some big retail chain,
then we can get...

09:12.870 --> 09:16.907
the person can get for a
property at this location

09:16.908 --> 09:18.241
with a high visibility

09:18.242 --> 09:20.443
and the density traffic
flow projections,

09:20.444 --> 09:24.947
on the high end, up to 500k.

09:25.854 --> 09:28.252
A half-million dollars? In Paulie?

09:28.253 --> 09:29.887
It's what Gilda said, Dad.

09:30.494 --> 09:32.620
I don't think we should get
ahead of ourselves yet.

09:32.621 --> 09:34.623
We're not getting ahead
of ourselves, Janet.

09:34.926 --> 09:36.092
These guys, they come down here

09:36.093 --> 09:37.927
and they think they're dealing
with a bunch of hayseeds,

09:37.928 --> 09:39.363
try to lowball you.

09:39.364 --> 09:41.932
They need to know that
we know what they know.

09:45.733 --> 09:46.970
Hello?

09:46.971 --> 09:49.840
Oh, hi, Mr. Childers.

09:49.841 --> 09:52.055
Right. Bob.

09:53.049 --> 09:55.740
What? You're kidding me.

09:56.380 --> 09:59.217
Well, that's ironic.

10:06.681 --> 10:09.349
Don't we need dogs or somethin'?

10:09.350 --> 10:11.961
That's for quail. We'll be all right.

10:11.962 --> 10:15.164
I'm rooting for the birds,
in case you were wonderin'.

10:15.165 --> 10:17.800
Rather get your dead animal
in a sealed package?

10:17.801 --> 10:21.004
Headless, too, if possible.

10:32.116 --> 10:34.082
It is nice out here.

10:34.846 --> 10:36.419
Just bein'.

10:40.644 --> 10:41.890
What was that?

10:42.529 --> 10:43.992
Might be a deer ruttin'.

10:44.577 --> 10:45.562
Little early, but...

10:45.563 --> 10:47.822
You are not gonna shoot a deer, are you?

10:47.823 --> 10:49.465
It's not deer hunting season yet.

10:49.466 --> 10:50.900
Not with guns, anyway.

10:50.901 --> 10:52.135
Hatchets?

10:53.503 --> 10:55.404
We don't have to shoot anything.

10:55.405 --> 10:56.940
We can just be.

11:10.196 --> 11:11.587
My dad liked to hunt.

11:12.514 --> 11:14.390
Mr. Lester?

11:15.083 --> 11:16.092
Yes.

11:16.751 --> 11:18.271
Mr. Lester.

11:21.811 --> 11:24.038
Daniel went with him one time.

11:24.567 --> 11:26.068
After they got back,

11:26.069 --> 11:28.439
he locked himself into
his room for like a day.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.937
Well, hunting's not for everybody.

11:34.627 --> 11:36.163
Why'd y'all get a divorce?

11:36.164 --> 11:38.832
Whoa, just gonna jump right in, are ya?

11:38.833 --> 11:40.567
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

11:40.568 --> 11:41.800
You don't have to talk about
it if you don't want.

11:41.801 --> 11:43.602
No, uh...

11:43.603 --> 11:45.472
Cynthia probably would say

11:45.473 --> 11:48.341
I was too stubborn, set in my ways.

11:48.342 --> 11:49.608
Were you?

11:49.609 --> 11:51.443
I didn't think so at the time.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.914
Just thought I liked things
the way I liked 'em.

11:53.915 --> 11:56.318
I can see a little of that.

11:58.702 --> 12:01.221
Her current husband
doesn't seem to mind...

12:01.222 --> 12:02.884
deferring, I guess.

12:03.606 --> 12:05.291
Can't you both defer?

12:05.292 --> 12:06.559
Not at the same time.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.861
Well, no shit, Billy.

12:07.862 --> 12:09.563
Sure, you can take turns as long

12:09.564 --> 12:12.199
as the one deferring doesn't
hold it against you later.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.969
Mom always seemed to know

12:16.970 --> 12:20.641
when to give up the
battle to win the war.

12:22.209 --> 12:25.411
And your dad couldn't
do that sometimes, too?

12:26.549 --> 12:28.648
Not really his strong suit.

12:29.957 --> 12:31.818
So you're looking for your mama?

12:31.819 --> 12:34.486
I'm not necessarily looking for anybody.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.856
Hey, that makes two of us.

12:36.857 --> 12:39.194
Something we can agree on, then.

12:44.699 --> 12:46.765
You want to hunt today or just be?

12:47.821 --> 12:49.535
I'll defer to you, Mr. Harris.

12:51.075 --> 12:52.373
All right, Miss Holden.

13:03.784 --> 13:06.419
All right, I'm making an
executive decision here.

13:06.420 --> 13:08.355
- Okay.
- I got to go.

13:08.356 --> 13:11.424
Just make sure you lock the
front door on your way out.

13:11.425 --> 13:12.559
No problem.

13:12.560 --> 13:15.216
And text me when you're gone.

13:15.217 --> 13:15.996
Got it.

13:15.997 --> 13:17.724
And no photos.

13:18.699 --> 13:19.966
Really, Rick?

13:19.967 --> 13:21.701
Hey, we had somebody steal

13:21.702 --> 13:24.337
the man's dirty underwear
off his tour bus one time.

13:24.884 --> 13:26.506
Well, that's just wrong.

13:26.507 --> 13:28.641
You're tellin' me.

13:28.642 --> 13:30.644
I think it was a dude, too.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.521
Sheriff Pickens.

13:43.044 --> 13:44.912
Jon Stern here.

13:46.852 --> 13:48.888
I'm sorry to just show up at your house,

13:48.889 --> 13:50.124
but you haven't returned my calls,

13:50.125 --> 13:53.801
and I thought perhaps you might
agree to see me in person.

13:55.569 --> 13:57.687
Answer a few pressing questions.

14:03.791 --> 14:06.957
I'll just be in my car if
you feel like talking.

14:10.577 --> 14:12.711
You're in luck. We're able to patch it.

14:13.280 --> 14:14.820
That is fortunate.

14:14.821 --> 14:17.624
I'd try to sell you a brand-new
tire if it wasn't a rental.

14:21.862 --> 14:25.497
Well, I won't hold you
in suspense any longer.

14:25.498 --> 14:28.068
I represent a national pharmacy chain,

14:28.069 --> 14:31.404
and they are prepared to make
an offer on your property.

14:31.405 --> 14:33.673
Now, does that include inventory?

14:33.674 --> 14:37.010
Uh, well, the offer would
take the inventory

14:37.011 --> 14:38.477
into consideration,

14:38.478 --> 14:40.480
but my client would not purchase it.

14:40.481 --> 14:43.482
We estimate... what now?

14:43.483 --> 14:46.419
You could disperse or retain,
uh, what's inside the property

14:46.420 --> 14:47.886
as you saw fit.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.856
So, we would still own the
tires and the equipment,

14:49.857 --> 14:51.558
just not the building
where we keep them?

14:51.559 --> 14:52.561
Correct, sir.

14:52.562 --> 14:54.394
So, what's the offer, Bob?

14:54.395 --> 14:56.663
Oh. Well, as I was saying, Ms. Holden,

14:56.664 --> 15:00.500
we are prepared to make an
offer on your property.

15:00.501 --> 15:01.900
Now, if you accept the offer,

15:01.901 --> 15:03.803
it will be one of three properties

15:03.804 --> 15:05.672
under consideration for purchase.

15:05.673 --> 15:06.939
Consideration?

15:06.940 --> 15:09.943
I would give you a check of $5,000 today

15:09.944 --> 15:12.911
that will be yours regardless
of the final decision.

15:13.666 --> 15:15.218
So, this isn't a real offer?

15:15.219 --> 15:17.983
Well, unfortunately, there
are a number of steps

15:17.984 --> 15:21.755
in determining if this property
is the most suitable one,

15:21.756 --> 15:24.023
some of which they would
need your cooperation

15:24.024 --> 15:25.424
to assess that viability.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.159
- $10,000.
- Teddy.

15:27.989 --> 15:29.596
It's a lot of stress, Dad.

15:29.597 --> 15:33.487
Regrettably, I am not authorized
to go beyond the $5,000.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.950
So, what is it... the
not-quite-an-offer offer?

15:36.951 --> 15:43.242
If all contingencies are
met, the offer is $650,000.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.008
Chloe?

16:01.715 --> 16:03.762
Oh, my God.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.063
What's wrong?

16:05.064 --> 16:07.033
You have to come down here.

16:07.034 --> 16:08.034
Why?

16:08.035 --> 16:09.012
Hurry!

16:16.423 --> 16:18.778
Pistachio gelato.

16:18.779 --> 16:20.712
Imported.

16:20.713 --> 16:22.784
Look at this.

16:24.588 --> 16:26.553
Isn't gelato dairy?

16:26.554 --> 16:27.920
Not today.

16:27.921 --> 16:30.557
This has to be Faith's idea.

16:30.558 --> 16:30.999
Faith?

16:31.000 --> 16:32.067
His wife.

16:32.660 --> 16:34.626
His wife is Faith?

16:34.627 --> 16:35.895
Or Charity.

16:35.896 --> 16:38.532
Have you ever had pistachio gelato?

16:40.935 --> 16:44.069
Have you had gelato ever?

16:44.070 --> 16:46.472
I don't think so, no.

16:46.473 --> 16:49.476
So, am I gonna get to witness
your first taste of gelato?

16:49.477 --> 16:51.944
- Shouldn't we go?
- Oh, of course we should.

16:51.945 --> 16:53.913
Do you mind eating after me or
do you want your own spoon?

16:53.914 --> 16:55.113
We shouldn't be here, Chloe.

16:55.114 --> 16:58.251
Says who? Says Rick? Rick is a dick.

16:58.252 --> 16:59.419
Well, he said we were supposed to go...

16:59.420 --> 17:02.755
Seriously, if Rick were to
come back, which he's not,

17:02.756 --> 17:05.023
I would tell him that I'm pregnant

17:05.025 --> 17:07.092
and I was gonna faint if
I didn't eat something.

17:07.093 --> 17:09.762
He would be feeding me at that point.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.166
Hey.

17:14.834 --> 17:17.270
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

17:17.271 --> 17:18.839
I promise.

17:20.741 --> 17:22.708
What is it?

17:23.497 --> 17:24.776
It's nothing.

17:24.777 --> 17:29.214
So, when it's something, we're
gonna say it's nothing?

17:29.215 --> 17:31.004
That's how we're gonna do this?

17:32.528 --> 17:35.621
I don't know what it is
we're... we're doing.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.656
We're just getting to know each other.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.791
I thought you were going
to your sister's.

17:40.429 --> 17:42.763
What does that have to do with it?

17:57.077 --> 18:01.847
A lot of the time, I-I feel like...

18:01.848 --> 18:04.051
Like what?

18:05.286 --> 18:07.693
Like danger, Will Robinson.

18:08.766 --> 18:11.924
Danger... around me?

18:13.290 --> 18:14.927
Around anything.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.663
Everything.

18:18.197 --> 18:22.269
Sometimes when I'm afraid...

18:24.070 --> 18:27.708
I try to focus on the
thing that I'm afraid of.

18:29.842 --> 18:32.211
I don't want to do that.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.113
Okay.

18:34.114 --> 18:36.249
No problem.

18:36.250 --> 18:38.617
What if you, um...

18:38.618 --> 18:42.655
what if you put your attention
on something else, then?

18:42.656 --> 18:44.157
Like what?

18:46.159 --> 18:48.061
Gelato.

18:49.730 --> 18:51.263
Oh, I'm serious.

18:51.264 --> 18:55.867
But... it'll only work

18:55.868 --> 18:59.251
if you completely surrender

18:59.252 --> 19:01.653
to the gelato experience.

19:03.937 --> 19:05.677
Just you...

19:05.678 --> 19:08.247
and the gelato.

19:09.570 --> 19:12.751
Nothing else exists in this moment

19:12.752 --> 19:17.891
except mano y gelato.

19:19.893 --> 19:22.196
Will you close your eyes for me?

19:26.700 --> 19:28.067
Ripeti.

19:28.068 --> 19:29.868
Mm-hmm.

19:29.869 --> 19:32.070
Mano.

19:33.307 --> 19:35.273
Mano.

19:35.274 --> 19:37.076
This is serious.

19:37.077 --> 19:38.344
- Mano.
- Mano.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.346
- Y.
- Y.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.048
Gelato.

19:42.049 --> 19:44.051
Gelato.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.961
Well?

19:54.962 --> 19:59.164
All fear has been
overwhelmed by desire...

19:59.165 --> 20:00.299
for more of that!

20:00.300 --> 20:02.135
Yes!

20:03.870 --> 20:05.704
It's all yours.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.718
I need something salty now anyway.

20:10.077 --> 20:11.743
I know!

20:16.437 --> 20:19.739
Do you remember Christopher
Nelms from school?

20:19.740 --> 20:21.408
Chris? Yeah.

20:21.409 --> 20:23.687
Do you remember seeing him
there that night at the party?

20:23.688 --> 20:26.222
No, I didn't see him till next mornin',

20:26.223 --> 20:28.191
at the Sheriff's office.

20:30.125 --> 20:31.061
I'm sorry?

20:31.062 --> 20:33.398
Yeah, he was sitting
by the Coke machine.

20:35.667 --> 20:38.467
Uh... he was never
officially interviewed.

20:38.468 --> 20:40.070
Only seven of you were.

20:40.071 --> 20:41.571
Oh, well, I don't know about that,

20:41.572 --> 20:43.372
but he was there with the rest of us.

20:43.373 --> 20:45.108
Well, how many of you were there?

20:45.109 --> 20:48.112
I didn't count, but I'd say at least 20.

20:53.179 --> 20:54.216
Hello?

20:54.217 --> 20:56.051
Uh, I'm sorry.

20:56.052 --> 20:59.455
Can I call you back, Susan,
if I have any more questions?

20:59.456 --> 21:01.025
Yeah, 'course.

21:11.934 --> 21:14.505
Have you not gone to
the bathroom all day?

21:16.288 --> 21:17.910
Not yet. No, ma'am.

21:21.206 --> 21:23.081
He's not gonna talk to you.

21:24.447 --> 21:26.083
Why not?

21:30.748 --> 21:33.425
I know his conscience is
bothering him, ma'am.

21:35.158 --> 21:36.792
Do you now?

21:36.793 --> 21:38.594
That's not a bad thing.

21:39.647 --> 21:41.231
That's a good thing.

21:41.232 --> 21:44.002
You know, it'd be a bad
thing if it didn't.

21:46.704 --> 21:49.539
You can go in the yard if you need to.

21:49.540 --> 21:51.142
I don't care.

22:05.769 --> 22:07.690
What do you think they're gonna do?

22:08.889 --> 22:10.389
Doesn't really matter.

22:10.933 --> 22:13.425
I don't have a say when it
comes down to it anyway.

22:15.115 --> 22:17.734
I... I'm sure they want your opinion.

22:19.537 --> 22:20.762
Yeah, right.

22:21.782 --> 22:23.849
I don't even know if
Dad has a say in it.

22:24.560 --> 22:27.045
Or if he did, if he'd
actually say anything.

22:35.251 --> 22:36.965
I don't know what the
hell I was thinkin'.

22:38.305 --> 22:40.322
Best laid plans.

22:40.323 --> 22:41.558
Well...

22:55.451 --> 22:57.148
How's the fettucine?

22:59.743 --> 23:01.072
Cheesy.

23:05.110 --> 23:07.183
Well, I'll have to go soon, I guess.

23:07.184 --> 23:08.620
Is that right?

23:11.655 --> 23:13.019
To work.

23:14.354 --> 23:17.232
You know, if we're not gonna talk
about what's going on in our lives,

23:17.861 --> 23:20.488
outside of whether we're
gonna stay together or not,

23:21.165 --> 23:23.468
I don't know what the hell
date night's even for.

23:26.169 --> 23:30.572
And just because I'm upset
doesn't mean I'm upset at you

23:30.573 --> 23:33.443
or that it's even about you, Tawney.

23:33.926 --> 23:35.344
I know that.

23:35.345 --> 23:37.647
I can't not be upset sometimes.

23:37.648 --> 23:39.249
I know that, too, Teddy.

23:39.250 --> 23:41.384
It just frightens me, your anger.

23:41.385 --> 23:43.588
I'm not angry, I'm upset!

23:57.948 --> 23:59.297
You don't need a husband.

24:00.986 --> 24:02.607
You need a saint.

24:15.386 --> 24:17.820
Okay, we
probably went too far.

24:30.301 --> 24:32.511
They want me to see somebody.

24:34.036 --> 24:35.526
Who does?

24:35.527 --> 24:37.940
The New Canaan Project...

24:37.941 --> 24:38.810
people.

24:40.846 --> 24:42.444
What kind of somebody?

24:43.955 --> 24:46.283
A-A PTSD specialist.

24:47.788 --> 24:48.919
That makes sense.

24:50.454 --> 24:52.254
Am I that bad?

24:52.255 --> 24:54.924
How can you not be traumatized?

24:54.925 --> 24:57.961
Just from being in there all that time.

24:57.962 --> 24:59.696
Yeah, well, I'm...

25:01.352 --> 25:04.902
not quite ready to get
into all that stuff.

25:15.436 --> 25:17.547
My little brother...

25:17.548 --> 25:19.482
was killed in an auto accident.

25:22.240 --> 25:23.919
It's been over a decade, but...

25:24.412 --> 25:26.079
it still pretty much sucks.

25:26.556 --> 25:28.657
I won't lie about that.

25:29.659 --> 25:31.261
I'm sorry, Chloe.

25:31.262 --> 25:32.993
I only bring it up because...

25:34.398 --> 25:37.867
it did eventually force
me to talk to somebody,

25:37.868 --> 25:39.601
and that helped.

25:39.602 --> 25:40.869
Some.

25:42.400 --> 25:45.407
I guess what I am saying, Daniel,

25:45.408 --> 25:49.678
is that almost everybody at
some point in their life

25:49.679 --> 25:52.381
has to deal with or figure out

25:52.382 --> 25:55.517
how not to deal with their stuff.

25:55.518 --> 26:00.822
You... you have a very
unique variety of it,

26:00.823 --> 26:04.793
and I don't think you have
the option of not dealing.

26:04.794 --> 26:08.563
Even with gelato now in my life?

26:08.564 --> 26:10.368
Sorry.

26:19.409 --> 26:22.779
Uh-oh. Guess who.

26:23.555 --> 26:24.986
Hi, Rick.

26:26.129 --> 26:27.984
Uh, I'm so sorry.

26:27.985 --> 26:30.887
I completely forgot to
text you before we left.

26:30.888 --> 26:35.524
Yeah, uh, we made sure the door
was locked on our way out.

26:35.525 --> 26:37.359
So, where are you now?

26:37.360 --> 26:38.761
Oh, you're going back out there.

26:38.762 --> 26:40.429
Soon?

26:40.430 --> 26:44.466
Um, well, please, uh, thank them

26:44.467 --> 26:47.437
for both of us for the, uh, donations.

26:48.805 --> 26:50.505
Where is he?

26:50.506 --> 26:51.542
No idea.

26:52.575 --> 26:54.910
What about your "I'm pregnant" speech?

26:54.911 --> 26:56.847
Way past its due date now.

27:00.687 --> 27:01.419
Jared?

27:01.927 --> 27:06.176
Jared, can you come down here, please?

27:16.254 --> 27:18.321
Ted?

27:18.322 --> 27:19.983
Yeah?

27:21.717 --> 27:24.228
Daniel's okay with you comin'.

27:26.964 --> 27:28.566
Did you hear me?

27:30.402 --> 27:31.822
Sounds good!

27:33.271 --> 27:36.007
Okay.

27:57.095 --> 27:59.497
Jared?

28:00.999 --> 28:02.200
- Honey?
- Jesus!

28:02.201 --> 28:04.198
- Mom.
- What are you doing?

28:04.199 --> 28:06.702
What am I doing? I'm trying to
find my heart. What are you doing?

28:06.703 --> 28:08.638
Can you turn the music down, please?

28:16.165 --> 28:17.780
Who's Peter Rand?

28:17.781 --> 28:19.348
Is that addressed to me?

28:19.349 --> 28:21.285
You didn't answer my question.

28:21.286 --> 28:22.752
I sold him some stuff.

28:23.643 --> 28:24.820
What are you talkin' about?

28:28.199 --> 28:29.566
You really wanna know?

28:29.567 --> 28:31.067
Of course I do.

28:31.068 --> 28:32.535
'Cause once I tell you,

28:32.536 --> 28:33.702
we can't go back.

28:33.703 --> 28:35.104
Jared.

28:35.105 --> 28:38.007
Okay, Mom.

28:38.008 --> 28:40.175
You asked for it.

28:40.176 --> 28:41.739
Furbys.

28:42.913 --> 28:44.614
Furbys?

28:44.615 --> 28:47.517
Yeah, I sold him three Furbys for $250.

28:48.561 --> 28:51.054
There's a check in here for $250?

28:51.055 --> 28:52.222
I hope.

28:52.223 --> 28:54.257
Jared, you can't give out your address

28:54.258 --> 28:56.058
to anybody you meet on the Internet.

28:56.059 --> 28:58.128
I didn't meet anyone, Mom.

29:00.063 --> 29:01.662
But still.

29:02.500 --> 29:05.611
The Furbys we gave you
for your sixth birthday?

29:06.736 --> 29:10.095
Fifth, but yes, those Furbys.

29:10.096 --> 29:11.673
Why would you do that?

29:11.674 --> 29:13.876
You're gonna wish you had those someday.

29:13.877 --> 29:16.431
No, I can assure you
I'll never wish that.

29:16.432 --> 29:18.532
Didn't really want them
in the first place.

29:20.113 --> 29:22.502
I-I mean, I appreciated
the gesture at the time,

29:22.503 --> 29:25.375
but they weren't really... my thing.

29:27.376 --> 29:29.577
Why did I think you liked Furbys?

29:29.578 --> 29:31.013
I don't know.

29:38.008 --> 29:39.787
Is that what you've been doin' up here?

29:40.153 --> 29:41.256
Pretty much.

29:42.336 --> 29:44.392
You haven't been selling any other...

29:44.393 --> 29:47.494
People's stuff? No, Mom, God.

29:47.495 --> 29:49.097
- Well, I don't know.
- Don't worry.

29:49.098 --> 29:52.466
Everything else that nobody will
ever want is still up here.

29:52.467 --> 29:55.403
When did you become so surly?

29:55.404 --> 29:57.405
I'm not sure.

29:57.406 --> 29:59.576
Over time, I guess.

30:00.850 --> 30:02.512
Look.

30:06.914 --> 30:08.546
It's your dad's army coat.

30:09.398 --> 30:11.560
It's... it's Lester's, Mom.

30:13.398 --> 30:15.165
I meant Lester.

30:23.997 --> 30:25.633
Why do you need money?

30:25.634 --> 30:26.934
So I can have money.

30:26.935 --> 30:28.636
We can give you money.

30:28.637 --> 30:30.037
It's not the same thing.

30:30.038 --> 30:32.572
I don't want you to have to
sell things to get money.

30:32.573 --> 30:34.809
I'm selling things because
I don't want them, Mom.

30:34.810 --> 30:36.912
I'm trying to simplify my life.

30:46.334 --> 30:47.687
I'm sorry.

30:48.420 --> 30:49.588
For what?

30:51.108 --> 30:53.495
For being such a bad mother.

30:56.122 --> 30:57.367
What?

31:00.313 --> 31:02.071
I don't know where that came from.

31:04.540 --> 31:07.427
Okay. I'm gonna quit now.

31:08.476 --> 31:10.512
Dinner will be ready in a little bit.

31:22.691 --> 31:25.495
You go to little boys'
birthday parties now?

31:26.831 --> 31:29.997
If you want to see your
friends anymore you do.

31:29.998 --> 31:31.648
Like Jenny Paar?

31:32.467 --> 31:34.601
I imagine she'll be there.

31:34.602 --> 31:37.439
With brood in tow.

31:45.914 --> 31:47.163
You okay?

31:52.345 --> 31:55.069
I never slept with anybody
until I moved to Atlanta.

31:57.516 --> 32:00.962
I sure wasn't gonna do it
with anyone from here.

32:01.477 --> 32:02.764
No offense.

32:05.160 --> 32:06.968
You had a lot going on back then.

32:07.723 --> 32:09.280
Still do, I guess.

32:11.906 --> 32:13.708
You want to say this didn't happen?

32:17.834 --> 32:19.280
No.

32:20.675 --> 32:22.277
Want me to take you home?

32:23.725 --> 32:25.162
Maybe in a little while.

32:39.847 --> 32:41.135
What day is it?

32:41.136 --> 32:42.538
It's Wednesday.

32:43.896 --> 32:45.379
Hump day.

32:46.608 --> 32:49.143
They're gonna call your nephew.

32:49.452 --> 32:51.875
See if somebody can go and
get your plaque for you.

32:55.426 --> 32:56.680
I made him up.

32:57.868 --> 32:58.964
Who?

33:00.214 --> 33:01.655
My nephew.

33:01.656 --> 33:06.059
I needed a name on the
blank, so I made him up.

33:06.547 --> 33:08.162
What are you saying?

33:08.163 --> 33:11.065
There's nobody to call, young lady.

33:12.298 --> 33:14.069
I don't believe that.

33:18.339 --> 33:21.908
Me and Claudia, for whatever reason,

33:21.909 --> 33:23.995
our lives got...

33:25.848 --> 33:26.891
smaller...

33:28.411 --> 33:30.784
and smaller over time.

33:31.524 --> 33:33.548
We liked it that way, I guess.

33:34.289 --> 33:38.155
Walling ourselves off from the world.

33:39.789 --> 33:41.469
But after she died,

33:42.697 --> 33:45.366
I stayed in that grief

33:46.207 --> 33:47.874
until there was a point

33:48.803 --> 33:51.349
where I understood I had to...

33:52.640 --> 33:55.268
give up the ghost, so to speak, or...

33:56.562 --> 33:57.602
Or what?

33:59.047 --> 34:01.108
Or it would become what it is.

34:02.975 --> 34:04.218
Well, what is it?

34:04.219 --> 34:05.828
What has it become?

34:06.687 --> 34:08.416
Very, very lonely.

34:11.161 --> 34:12.512
And empty.

34:14.996 --> 34:17.045
And now I'm ready to go.

34:21.302 --> 34:23.110
Where do you think you're goin'?

34:23.739 --> 34:25.768
To see her in heaven.

34:27.141 --> 34:28.259
How do you know?

34:29.230 --> 34:31.248
If you have faith...

34:32.808 --> 34:34.016
you know.

34:38.034 --> 34:40.578
But what if you...
you've lost your faith?

34:41.315 --> 34:44.358
You mean what if you've lost your faith?

34:45.215 --> 34:46.306
Yes.

34:46.909 --> 34:48.329
Yes, that's what I mean.

34:48.330 --> 34:49.715
I don't know.

34:50.618 --> 34:54.235
Maybe you have to decide if
you want to find it first.

34:57.358 --> 34:59.608
I still don't believe you.

35:01.508 --> 35:03.296
I think there's somebody in your life.

35:04.358 --> 35:06.648
You're not telling me
everything, Mr. Zeke.

35:07.612 --> 35:08.979
You're a good girl.

35:10.835 --> 35:12.627
Say your prayers,

35:13.978 --> 35:15.340
you'll be all right.

35:16.200 --> 35:18.259
Why do you keep sayin' that to me?

35:18.260 --> 35:20.448
You keep asking for it.

35:21.042 --> 35:22.948
It's in everything you do.

36:07.826 --> 36:10.009
Hey. It's me.

36:10.010 --> 36:11.517
Um...

36:12.013 --> 36:15.516
I... I know that this store
situation is a big deal,

36:15.517 --> 36:17.117
and... and I'm... I'm sorry

36:17.118 --> 36:19.219
that I wasn't there for you tonight.

36:19.220 --> 36:20.521
I really am.

36:21.241 --> 36:24.023
I get all in my head sometimes.

36:24.024 --> 36:26.961
It's something I'm... I'm
working on with Rebecca.

36:37.387 --> 36:39.873
Hey. It's me.

36:39.874 --> 36:41.442
Um...

36:41.443 --> 36:45.846
I... I know that this store
situation is a big deal,

36:45.847 --> 36:47.380
and... and I'm... I'm sorry

36:47.381 --> 36:49.017
that I wasn't there for you tonight.

36:50.592 --> 36:52.186
I really am.

36:52.187 --> 36:54.925
I get all in my head sometimes.

36:55.823 --> 36:58.378
It's something I'm... I'm
working on with Rebecca.

36:59.260 --> 37:01.494
Anyway, um...

37:02.363 --> 37:05.331
I thought maybe you might want
to come by tomorrow morning

37:05.332 --> 37:08.235
or... or Friday if that's better.

37:08.236 --> 37:11.045
I-If you want to.

37:11.939 --> 37:14.856
We could just talk or... or something.

37:16.077 --> 37:17.567
Just a thought.

37:19.083 --> 37:20.581
Love you.

37:43.279 --> 37:44.544
Hey.

37:45.712 --> 37:47.014
Hey!

37:48.514 --> 37:50.316
What about my beer?

37:50.317 --> 37:51.517
Oh, right.

37:51.518 --> 37:53.154
I forgot.

37:57.268 --> 37:59.192
Now you think that I'm the bad guy?

38:04.732 --> 38:07.168
Bunch of goddamn lemmings!

38:16.509 --> 38:18.111
Excuse me.

38:23.246 --> 38:24.684
Tough crowd, huh?

38:25.688 --> 38:27.352
I remember you.

38:28.216 --> 38:29.722
From Holden's press conference.

38:30.506 --> 38:32.425
A lot's happened since then.

38:32.426 --> 38:35.046
Yeah. Your boy confessed again.

38:37.449 --> 38:38.664
You been followin' me?

38:39.109 --> 38:41.728
Just came in for a
beer after a long day.

38:42.963 --> 38:44.604
Long day of what?

38:46.228 --> 38:49.374
So, what are you gonna do about
your little situation, Trey?

38:50.861 --> 38:52.284
Well...

38:53.416 --> 38:55.048
I damn sure ain't gon' plead guilty

38:55.049 --> 38:56.716
to something I didn't do.

38:57.434 --> 38:59.184
You suggesting Daniel did?

38:59.185 --> 39:01.888
Trying to put words in my
mouth, just like a lawyer.

39:02.712 --> 39:05.490
Or a prosecutor, in some cases.

39:06.781 --> 39:08.628
They seem to have a
real good track record

39:08.629 --> 39:13.365
around here with convictions,
whether someone did it or not.

39:14.098 --> 39:15.806
Yeah, we'll see about that.

39:16.997 --> 39:20.141
I think they want you to go to
jail for a long time, Trey.

39:22.409 --> 39:24.609
I'm beginning to wonder if you might be

39:24.610 --> 39:26.546
what is known as a make-up call.

39:28.040 --> 39:31.386
My high-priced attorney wouldn't
approve of us talking, so...

39:33.404 --> 39:35.590
See ya. Wouldn't want to be ya.

39:37.054 --> 39:39.320
Why does Chris Nelms never get dirty?

39:42.840 --> 39:45.065
Are you his bitch or something?

39:52.518 --> 39:55.307
You don't know half as
much as you think you do.

39:55.878 --> 39:57.242
About what?

39:58.382 --> 40:01.180
About the way the world works down here.

40:01.181 --> 40:03.316
Well, why don't you tell me, then?

40:13.201 --> 40:14.727
Go ask Roger.

40:15.728 --> 40:17.064
Roger?

40:18.764 --> 40:20.198
Who's Roger?

40:24.003 --> 40:26.139
You are just stumbling
around the dark, ain't ya?

40:28.571 --> 40:30.839
Chris always had the most to lose.

40:32.369 --> 40:34.546
I don't know why people don't see that.

40:34.547 --> 40:35.847
What do you mean?

40:35.848 --> 40:38.350
I mean if it wasn't
your kooky-ass client,

40:38.904 --> 40:40.653
I'd put my money on country club Chris.

40:41.561 --> 40:43.189
For killing Hanna, you mean?

40:43.589 --> 40:44.890
What the hell we talkin' about?

40:46.015 --> 40:48.528
Why would I ever believe
anything you say?

40:54.365 --> 40:56.302
Somethin's got to be the truth.

41:21.772 --> 41:22.902
Looks nice.

41:23.823 --> 41:26.332
Better than some of the
places I've resided.

41:28.635 --> 41:30.336
Is it strange?

41:30.337 --> 41:32.537
Yes to whatever you're talkin' about.

41:34.080 --> 41:37.884
I don't know. To... to... be here.

41:40.051 --> 41:42.253
To be dropped off like a...

41:42.254 --> 41:45.088
Perpetual teenager?

41:46.684 --> 41:47.258
Maybe.

41:47.259 --> 41:48.694
I don't know.

41:50.433 --> 41:52.961
This is... just where I am.

41:53.732 --> 41:55.237
In this car.

41:56.602 --> 41:57.813
With you.

41:59.888 --> 42:01.514
And it's strange,

42:01.515 --> 42:03.471
but certainly not unpleasant.

42:04.982 --> 42:06.677
Oh, boy.

42:07.199 --> 42:08.650
I was afraid of that.

42:10.631 --> 42:13.092
You don't owe me anything, Chloe.

42:14.553 --> 42:17.890
If it's only this day, I'll take it.

42:21.026 --> 42:23.448
Sometimes I just...

42:24.228 --> 42:27.634
freak out thinking about
having a baby alone.

42:29.234 --> 42:31.116
Having a baby with someone.

42:32.428 --> 42:34.169
Having a baby.

42:35.786 --> 42:39.010
Now, that sounds perfectly normal.

42:40.667 --> 42:43.046
I never used to think like that, though.

42:43.047 --> 42:44.349
Like what?

42:44.350 --> 42:45.664
Of the future.

42:47.185 --> 42:48.482
Me neither.

42:50.088 --> 42:52.224
What am I worried about, then?

42:53.730 --> 42:54.822
We're...

42:55.828 --> 42:58.046
temporarily perfect for each other.

42:59.263 --> 43:00.680
At least for today.

43:04.035 --> 43:05.915
I have to go now.

43:08.306 --> 43:10.203
Grown man curfew.

43:13.344 --> 43:15.214
Thank you, Daniel.

43:28.761 --> 43:30.018
Thank you, Chloe.

44:06.799 --> 44:08.301
Ahh.

44:16.975 --> 44:19.376
Ahh.

44:20.346 --> 44:22.280
Yeah.
