[Lil] <i>For the longest time,</i>
<i>I was so angry at God.</i>

00:25.234 --> 00:29.744
<i>I thought, "God let this happen.</i>
<i>God did this to me."</i>

00:30.155 --> 00:34.325
I was scared to death to talk about it,
to experience it.

00:34.409 --> 00:38.249
To be able to accept the fact
that this has happened.

00:39.831 --> 00:41.921
<i>There's so many foggy memories,</i>

00:42.417 --> 00:45.127
<i>so many questions that I have</i>
<i>about what happened,</i>

00:45.712 --> 00:49.382
<i>which is why I didn't, uh, say anything</i>
<i>for so long.</i>

00:50.133 --> 00:52.763
<i>It was like</i>
<i>I didn't really know what happened.</i>

00:54.263 --> 00:56.393
<i>And it wasn't something I wanted to know.</i>

00:56.848 --> 00:58.478
<i>I didn't wanna know any of it.</i>

01:01.103 --> 01:05.483
<i>But then one day, it was the late '90s</i>

01:05.566 --> 01:11.486
<i>and I had heard that, uh, Father Maskell</i>
<i>was at Stella Maris</i>

01:11.572 --> 01:13.742
<i>hiding in the dementia ward.</i>

01:15.200 --> 01:17.540
So, I put on a bright red suit

01:17.828 --> 01:22.828
and I made an appointment
with the admissions director.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.417
I told them I was looking for my father,

01:26.086 --> 01:28.416
<i>and I went to see Father Maskell.</i>

01:30.799 --> 01:35.049
<i>I paid attention to how she got in there,</i>
<i>took note of all the buttons she pushed.</i>

01:35.512 --> 01:38.812
<i>We went in there</i>
<i>and then I stood in front of his room.</i>

01:39.182 --> 01:42.312
And I asked a lot of questions
and just looked inside

01:42.394 --> 01:45.564
and saw that he was, uh, in the bed.

01:47.190 --> 01:50.570
<i>After she had given me all the information</i>
<i>and left me,</i>

01:51.153 --> 01:54.663
I went in exactly
how she had taken me through,

01:55.657 --> 01:56.737
<i>back to his ward.</i>

01:56.825 --> 02:00.615
<i>It was supposed to be employees only,</i>
<i>but I went back in.</i>

02:02.539 --> 02:04.829
<i>And, um, he was being wheeled out.</i>

02:04.916 --> 02:08.916
Now, he's not that old, you know, he's 60.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.048
Early 60s, something like that.

02:12.132 --> 02:15.432
<i>I went up to the caregiver</i>
<i>and I said, "I know Father Maskell.</i>

02:15.927 --> 02:19.007
Would it be okay if I said hello?"
And she goes, "Sure."

02:20.766 --> 02:23.136
<i>So, I get right up to his face</i>

02:23.226 --> 02:25.476
<i>and put my hands on his arms</i>
<i>and everything</i>

02:25.562 --> 02:28.822
<i>and I said, "Father Maskell.</i>
<i>It's Lil Hughes.</i>

02:28.899 --> 02:32.239
<i>Do you remember me? I used to work</i>
<i>with you at Archbishop Keough."</i>

02:33.362 --> 02:35.572
And I'm, like, about
this far from his face.

02:37.032 --> 02:40.332
<i>I probably would've had some things</i>
<i>to say to him.</i>

02:40.619 --> 02:43.789
<i>I would've told him exactly</i>
<i>what he had done to me,</i>

02:44.247 --> 02:46.457
but there was no one home.

02:46.625 --> 02:50.295
No one. There was nothing
in his eyes at all.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.964
<i>All the evil gone, everything was gone.</i>

02:53.298 --> 02:54.718
<i>Something took care of it.</i>

02:55.217 --> 03:01.467
His life was ending in his early 60s,
which is premature and well-deserved.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.072
[wind rustling]

04:03.326 --> 04:05.076
[Bob] <i>Okay. Well...</i>

04:06.621 --> 04:10.501
<i>Maskell's dead.</i>
<i>So, that takes him out of the game.</i>

04:11.501 --> 04:13.501
<i>But I've never been convinced</i>

04:13.587 --> 04:16.416
that Maskell was directly...

04:17.423 --> 04:20.144
hands on, involved in the murder.

04:21.261 --> 04:25.141
I didn't get the impression that--
That Maskell was the kind of guy

04:26.016 --> 04:28.346
who would do that himself.

04:30.228 --> 04:34.018
<i>Now, he might well have</i>
<i>gotten somebody to do that.</i>

04:34.107 --> 04:38.607
<i>That struck me</i>
<i>as a much more possible theory.</i>

04:39.237 --> 04:43.367
Somewhere, some-- Somebody knows
something, as the saying goes and...

04:43.909 --> 04:44.909
But we don't know who.

04:46.161 --> 04:47.371
[cell phone vibrates]

04:48.246 --> 04:51.666
[Gemma] <i>I got a text message,</i>
<i>and a woman asked me to call her.</i>

04:52.334 --> 04:56.714
And when I called her, she said,
"My uncle killed Sister Cathy."

04:57.297 --> 04:59.047
So, of course, I was taken aback.

04:59.132 --> 05:02.682
And we talked some more
and I asked her a lot of questions.

05:03.094 --> 05:08.434
And, um, we kind of were dubious at first.

05:09.309 --> 05:13.899
[Abbie] <i>It sounds far-fetched,</i>
<i>but the more people you begin to talk to,</i>

05:14.064 --> 05:16.154
<i>who tell you versions of the same story,</i>

05:16.233 --> 05:19.653
who didn't know each other,
the more you begin to think

05:19.820 --> 05:22.410
maybe there is more to this
than we know.

05:35.210 --> 05:37.210
[Debbie] <i>Family secrets</i>
<i>are very dangerous.</i>

05:38.213 --> 05:41.683
When you tell a child not to speak
of something and they do,

05:41.758 --> 05:44.258
it makes it easier
not to speak of other things.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.517
<i>And then I think there's a-- A point</i>

05:49.599 --> 05:53.099
<i>where the adults begin</i>
<i>to believe the secrets.</i>

06:01.152 --> 06:02.452
<i>My mom was a drinker.</i>

06:03.446 --> 06:05.566
And one night,
we're sitting up really late

06:05.657 --> 06:07.697
and she had had a whole lot to drink.

06:08.159 --> 06:11.249
I did not drink,
so I was sitting there listening to her.

06:11.329 --> 06:15.579
<i>And she starts talking</i>
<i>about my uncle, Uncle Ed.</i>

06:17.919 --> 06:21.799
<i>And she went on and on</i>
<i>about a trunk and bloody clothes,</i>

06:22.090 --> 06:26.640
<i>and had this whole story</i>
<i>about her brother.</i>

06:29.973 --> 06:33.273
I waited until the next day
and brought it up to her in the kitchen,

06:33.351 --> 06:36.351
and she looked at me panicked
and said, "I never said that."

06:37.355 --> 06:40.025
And I didn't hear anything else
about it for years.

06:46.281 --> 06:49.411
<i>My aunt was Uncle Ed's first wife.</i>

06:50.577 --> 06:55.577
<i>We had connected on Facebook</i>
<i>probably about four years ago.</i>

06:56.708 --> 07:00.168
She was telling me, um, her version

07:00.295 --> 07:04.045
of what happened the night
that Sister Cathy went missing.

07:08.261 --> 07:13.101
[Margaret] <i>Well, we met in probably</i>
<i>junior year of high school.</i>

07:14.309 --> 07:17.849
<i>I just immediately was drawn to him.</i>

07:19.773 --> 07:25.073
<i>He was very kind to me,</i>
<i>he was good-looking, very charming.</i>

07:25.779 --> 07:28.279
<i>I guess it was almost like</i>
<i>love at first sight.</i>

07:38.124 --> 07:40.674
<i>We became engaged at Christmastime.</i>

07:41.753 --> 07:45.843
<i>Three days before the wedding</i>
<i>actually was to take place,</i>

07:45.966 --> 07:50.756
<i>his sister called and she said,</i>
<i>"I don't want you to marry my brother.</i>

07:51.304 --> 07:53.604
<i>There's things about Ed you don't know."</i>

07:54.391 --> 07:56.851
<i>And I said, "What do you mean?</i>

07:56.935 --> 07:59.225
<i>I know he's immature.</i>
<i>I've seen some of that."</i>

07:59.312 --> 08:02.902
I said, "But after-- You know,
after we get married, I'll fix him."

08:03.566 --> 08:04.986
<i>So, we got married.</i>

08:05.777 --> 08:09.317
<i>And one day, I went home early from work.</i>

08:09.864 --> 08:12.334
And for the first time,
I got to open the mail

08:12.409 --> 08:16.039
and find out
that there were bills piled up,

08:16.121 --> 08:17.751
<i>the rent wasn't getting paid,</i>

08:18.289 --> 08:21.499
<i>there was threatening notices</i>
<i>from everywhere.</i>

08:22.168 --> 08:26.168
<i>So, I was just sitting</i>
<i>and kind of shaking in it,</i>

08:26.256 --> 08:28.086
<i>in the chair when he came in.</i>

08:28.466 --> 08:31.006
And as soon as he came in,
I said, "You're busted."

08:31.636 --> 08:33.596
I said, "I know what you've been doing.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.773
You've been playing these games.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.520
<i>You have not been going to work."</i>

08:39.144 --> 08:40.563
<i>I said, "You're lying."</i>

08:41.354 --> 08:45.284
<i>So, I went and got my suitcase</i>
<i>and I started putting stuff in it.</i>

08:45.650 --> 08:48.650
<i>And Ed, at that point, got violent.</i>

08:49.320 --> 08:54.370
His face became extremely,
um, agitated and distorted,

08:54.784 --> 08:56.374
and he started choking me.

08:58.038 --> 09:03.498
<i>And he said, "Do you realize</i>
<i>that I could kill you right now</i>

09:04.419 --> 09:08.339
<i>and tell myself</i>
<i>that somebody else did this</i>

09:09.549 --> 09:10.549
<i>and believe it?"</i>

09:12.010 --> 09:16.470
<i>And I swore</i>
<i>I would never go near this man again.</i>

09:17.223 --> 09:19.983
<i>But, unbeknownst to me,</i>
<i>I was carrying twins.</i>

09:21.061 --> 09:24.441
<i>So... </i> [chuckles] <i> we went back together.</i>

09:24.939 --> 09:29.439
<i>And, um, in October, the twins were born,</i>

09:29.527 --> 09:34.447
and the little girl was four-seven,
so, they kept her in the preemie ward.

09:35.533 --> 09:41.253
<i>November 7th was the day</i>
<i>that Bon Secours Hospital called me</i>

09:41.331 --> 09:45.591
<i>and said, "You can pick</i>
<i>your little daughter up tomorrow.</i>

09:45.668 --> 09:48.048
<i>She's exactly five pounds."</i>

09:49.631 --> 09:51.841
<i>So, I came in on the 7th,</i>

09:52.383 --> 09:56.143
<i>and I'm all excited</i>
<i>about picking our baby up.</i>

09:56.971 --> 10:00.601
<i>I looked at the clock in the foyer</i>
<i>when he walked in</i>

10:00.809 --> 10:03.939
<i>and I said, "What are you doing home?</i>
<i>It's only 9:30."</i>

10:04.771 --> 10:10.151
And then I happened to notice right away
that his white shirt was full of blood.

10:11.986 --> 10:13.946
I was like, "What happened?"

10:15.073 --> 10:17.203
Ed says, "Oh, nothing."

10:17.283 --> 10:19.953
He says, "My boss
wouldn't give me my paycheck

10:20.036 --> 10:21.656
and I know how bad we need it."

10:21.746 --> 10:26.706
He said, "So, I got in a fight with him
and he punched me in the nose."

10:27.252 --> 10:31.092
And it was that Sunday...

10:32.841 --> 10:37.551
<i>when the news came out on the TV</i>
<i>that Sister Cesnik had disappeared.</i>

10:38.471 --> 10:41.391
<i>He was sitting in a chair</i>
<i>right in front of the TV</i>

10:41.975 --> 10:43.425
and I was feeding the babies,

10:43.518 --> 10:47.148
and it's, you know, freeze-frame
in my head.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.479
<i>And I heard the newsman saying</i>

10:50.567 --> 10:55.737
<i>that the sister had disappeared</i>
<i>on November 7th.</i>

10:56.447 --> 10:58.987
<i>Right away, I'm getting a flashback.</i>

10:59.534 --> 11:03.204
<i>"November 7th, that was the night</i>
<i>before we picked up our baby.</i>

11:03.288 --> 11:06.458
<i>That was the night Ed came in</i>
<i>with the bloody shirt."</i>

11:06.708 --> 11:08.128
So, I looked at him,

11:08.751 --> 11:11.801
and his reaction was
rocking back in the chair

11:11.880 --> 11:14.010
<i>and getting a smirk and kind of laughing.</i>

11:15.258 --> 11:19.598
<i>He said, "By the time they find her body,</i>
<i>it's gonna be wintertime.</i>

11:19.679 --> 11:22.059
<i>She's gonna be buried under the snow."</i>

11:23.308 --> 11:26.058
And I couldn't get my mind
off of his reaction,

11:26.144 --> 11:28.734
and my mind going back to that night,

11:28.813 --> 11:32.903
and, "My God,
could Ed have done something like that?"

11:34.777 --> 11:39.277
<i>And then, you know, shortly after that,</i>
<i>Ed came home</i>

11:39.365 --> 11:41.905
<i>and he said he had stopped</i>
<i>at Montgomery Ward's.</i>

11:41.993 --> 11:46.753
<i>He gave me the bill so I could see</i>
<i>how much it was, and I said, "Holy cow.</i>

11:47.415 --> 11:52.455
Brand new tires?"
I said, "Why? We can't afford this."

11:53.296 --> 11:57.046
He said, "Well, I just felt
that wintertime's coming

11:57.133 --> 11:58.973
and we should have new tires."

11:59.928 --> 12:06.098
So, I started putting that
as another piece to the puzzle

12:06.851 --> 12:11.271
and thinking, "I wonder
if that's why he got the tires changed,

12:11.773 --> 12:12.863
'cause of tracks?"

12:14.817 --> 12:20.737
We separated in October of 1970,

12:21.115 --> 12:24.235
right before the twins' first birthday.

12:24.994 --> 12:30.214
A year later, would've been,
uh, 1971, October.

12:30.750 --> 12:34.170
My girlfriend called me and said
that she read the newspaper,

12:34.253 --> 12:37.173
and there was a guy going around
at Rock Glen High School

12:37.256 --> 12:38.716
<i>trying to pick up girls.</i>

12:39.217 --> 12:44.387
<i>It was a man in his 20s,</i>
<i>and, uh, brown hair, blue eyes,</i>

12:44.472 --> 12:48.062
<i>driving a car around</i>
<i>Rock Glen High School</i>

12:48.267 --> 12:52.017
<i>trying to entice girls into the car.</i>

12:52.605 --> 12:56.525
<i>It was a stolen car</i>
<i>from British Imports in Towson.</i>

12:58.277 --> 13:02.657
Ed called me the night before
or the night before that

13:02.740 --> 13:06.450
and said he was driving around
in a stolen car

13:06.744 --> 13:08.664
from British Imports in Towson.

13:09.664 --> 13:12.964
I called the police
about that newspaper article,

13:13.626 --> 13:16.296
<i>which eventually did lead</i>
<i>to Ed's arrest</i>

13:16.879 --> 13:19.299
<i>in November of '71.</i>

13:28.266 --> 13:29.636
[computer chiming]

13:29.726 --> 13:30.846
[Gemma] What's that mean?

13:39.152 --> 13:41.452
[Abbie] Did you--? Is this a touch screen?

13:41.529 --> 13:44.369
Ah-ha! Well, that-- That could be...

13:44.449 --> 13:45.409
[Gemma] Is he there?

13:46.159 --> 13:48.869
-Ah! Hey.
-[Gemma] Okay. Are you there?

13:48.953 --> 13:50.003
-Hi.
-[Abbie] There you are.

13:50.079 --> 13:51.539
-<i>Hi.</i>
-[Gemma] Good.

13:51.622 --> 13:53.752
-I'll hang up my phone.
-[Abbie] You can see us?

13:53.833 --> 13:57.093
We have a table set out here
with coffee filters

13:57.170 --> 14:00.760
with all of our main players' names
on them, and--

14:00.840 --> 14:04.050
-[Alan] <i>Yeah, great.</i>
-Gemma has tried to create a web here

14:04.135 --> 14:07.095
of people and their connections
to each other.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.890
-<i>Okay.</i>
-[Abbie] You wanna talk about Edgar?

14:08.973 --> 14:10.813
[Gemma] Let's bring Edgar into it.

14:10.892 --> 14:14.402
[Abbie] <i>Edgar was a man</i>
<i>who lived a complicated life.</i>

14:14.479 --> 14:19.229
I mean, he was arrested for car theft
two years after Cathy was murdered,

14:19.317 --> 14:21.487
and he was loitering at the middle school

14:21.569 --> 14:24.699
trying to pick up middle school girls
in a stolen car.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.779
And literally, the middle school is here

14:27.867 --> 14:30.447
<i>and Cathy's apartment complex is here.</i>

14:30.995 --> 14:33.865
<i>They butt up against each other</i>
<i>at parking lots.</i>

14:34.374 --> 14:37.344
We looked at him
because Edgar's first wife,

14:37.668 --> 14:42.338
who I believe,
she gave us this complicated story,

14:42.423 --> 14:44.803
and we researched it and looked it up,

14:44.884 --> 14:46.594
and everything was true.

14:46.677 --> 14:49.507
We found court records,
we found marriage licenses,

14:49.972 --> 14:53.892
uh, newspaper articles, everything
confirmed her details perfectly.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.607
<i>The night that Cathy was abducted,</i>

15:00.149 --> 15:03.529
<i>she was shopping that evening</i>
<i>for an engagement present for her sister.</i>

15:05.071 --> 15:09.331
<i>And when the police found her car,</i>
<i>they had proof of a bank transaction.</i>

15:09.409 --> 15:12.079
<i>So, we know that she did go</i>
<i>to the bank to cash the check.</i>

15:13.079 --> 15:17.669
She was going to go and buy
some Baltimore favorite baked rolls

15:17.750 --> 15:19.500
at a bakery called Muhly's.

15:19.585 --> 15:22.705
<i>And they found those rolls in the car</i>
<i>when they found the car.</i>

15:22.797 --> 15:24.757
<i>So, we know she went to Muhly's.</i>

15:25.383 --> 15:28.093
She said was gonna go
and buy this engagement present.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.681
When they searched the car,
the present was not there

15:30.763 --> 15:32.183
and has never been found.

15:35.393 --> 15:39.063
[Margaret] <i>The Christmas</i>
<i>after Sister Cesnik disappeared,</i>

15:39.522 --> 15:45.492
<i>Ed gave me this necklace</i>
<i>as part of a Christmas gift.</i>

15:46.988 --> 15:50.698
<i>And just kind of came up behind me</i>
<i>and put it on my neck.</i>

15:54.078 --> 15:55.748
<i>He said, "This is for you."</i>

15:57.457 --> 15:59.747
<i>He didn't really give me gifts like that.</i>

16:00.585 --> 16:03.415
<i>We didn't have any money,</i>
<i>I didn't know how we could afford--</i>

16:03.504 --> 16:07.304
<i>And if he were to pick out jewelry,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

16:08.134 --> 16:10.684
<i>I was almost certain</i>
<i>he would get my birthstone.</i>

16:11.220 --> 16:14.430
<i>But it had a green stone in it,</i>
<i>and then it was a wedding bell.</i>

16:14.724 --> 16:17.064
And I thought,
why are you giving me a wedding bell

16:17.143 --> 16:23.363
when we've already been married
for, you know, a year, maybe almost two.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.784
I felt like he didn't buy that for me.

16:26.861 --> 16:30.161
I felt like it was for somebody else
and it was given to me.

16:31.115 --> 16:35.235
You know, I, like, just kept it in one
place in my jewelry box and never wore it.

16:35.536 --> 16:38.116
<i>And don't know why I kept it.</i>

16:38.206 --> 16:42.836
<i>I mean... I-- I just forgot about it.</i>

16:44.545 --> 16:50.425
[Bill] Debbie's aunt gave us the--
The necklace, told us to hold on to it.

16:50.927 --> 16:54.967
I looked at the stone and as--
As you can see it's a light, light green,

16:55.056 --> 16:57.136
<i>which is an August birthstone.</i>

16:57.225 --> 17:00.015
<i>So, you know,</i>
<i>I think we both have the goal</i>

17:00.102 --> 17:06.152
that if there are still people
that are still alive involved in this,

17:06.692 --> 17:08.902
we obviously wanna see justice done.

17:09.403 --> 17:10.703
And we'd like to return it

17:10.780 --> 17:15.490
or, you know, give it to the person
that it was intended for.

17:21.665 --> 17:25.205
[Abbie] <i>I did get in touch with</i>
<i>Cathy's cousins in Pennsylvania</i>

17:25.294 --> 17:27.094
<i>who were initially pleasant,</i>

17:27.171 --> 17:29.801
but sort of said,
"We've had enough pain, leave us alone.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.802
We don't have anything to tell you."
We sort of respected that.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.755
We wanted to try to get in touch
with the family to ask them:

17:35.846 --> 17:39.226
"Does green mean something?
Was it the bride's favorite color?

17:39.308 --> 17:42.438
Was it a birthstone for the bride?

17:43.187 --> 17:46.187
Does it have any significance
in view of being something

17:46.274 --> 17:49.694
that she might have picked out for
the wedding for an engagement present?"

17:52.863 --> 17:54.873
[thunder rumbling]

18:10.756 --> 18:14.636
[Gemma] As our investigation progressed
and developed,

18:15.261 --> 18:18.761
we found that an anonymous tip line
would be helpful.

18:19.056 --> 18:25.686
So, Abbie set this up so that anybody
who had information to share with us,

18:25.771 --> 18:30.821
questions, comments,
could send information anonymously.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.160
When we felt like
we had gathered a lot of evidence

18:34.238 --> 18:37.948
and were starting to make assumptions
about Edgar Davidson

18:38.034 --> 18:42.164
<i>and his family as being involved</i>
<i>in Sister Cathy's murder...</i>

18:42.872 --> 18:46.462
<i>...a whole other family showed up</i>
<i>on our anonymous tip line.</i>

18:47.084 --> 18:48.794
<i>That was the Schmidt Family,</i>

18:49.086 --> 18:53.626
<i>the niece of a man</i>
<i>who had been Sister Cathy's neighbor</i>

18:53.716 --> 18:56.636
<i>shared with us a very similar story.</i>

18:56.886 --> 19:02.056
That she felt like her uncle
had been involved in Cathy's murder.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.983
[Abbie] <i>I'm a pinch hitter today.</i>

19:06.103 --> 19:10.983
<i>Gemma is laid low with a bronchitis</i>
<i>and a laryngitis and can't speak at all.</i>

19:11.275 --> 19:13.815
So, I volunteered
to fill in for her stead.

19:14.153 --> 19:18.573
Leave my computer and my research lines
to actually come talk to people.

19:18.699 --> 19:21.079
That's a little scary
to have to go talk to people,

19:21.160 --> 19:22.790
but we will-- We will tough it out.

19:22.870 --> 19:23.830
[chuckles]

19:23.913 --> 19:25.873
Nobody's hurt me so far in this.

19:29.126 --> 19:33.296
We are driving to meet a lady
I have never met named Sharon Schmidt.

19:33.631 --> 19:37.971
We had Edgar's family, who believed
that he was involved with her murder.

19:38.052 --> 19:40.762
And now we have a second family
coming forward

19:40.930 --> 19:43.270
saying that they have a man
in their family

19:43.432 --> 19:45.562
who they believed was involved that night.

19:45.893 --> 19:48.773
So, now our task is to try to figure out

19:48.854 --> 19:52.484
if evidence is pointing more
toward one or the other,

19:52.566 --> 19:56.816
or if there's a chance
they were working together on this,

19:57.363 --> 20:00.413
<i>perhaps at the behest of Father Maskell.</i>

20:07.164 --> 20:09.294
Hi. Did you find me okay?

20:09.750 --> 20:10.670
-Hi, Abbie.
-[Abbie] Hi.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.671
Hi, I'm Sharon. Nice to meet you.

20:20.511 --> 20:23.471
I guess I'm anxious to hear
what we're gonna talk about tonight.

20:24.974 --> 20:30.234
<i>I view my family as a pretty open</i>
<i>and communicative type of family.</i>

20:30.604 --> 20:34.574
<i>But this has flushed some things out</i>
<i>of our family closet</i>

20:34.650 --> 20:36.570
<i>that I just wasn't aware of.</i>

20:37.611 --> 20:38.781
<i>I remember the night,</i>

20:38.863 --> 20:42.073
because my mother and father
were having a very, very, very--

20:42.700 --> 20:45.410
It seems to me
like a really intense argument.

20:45.494 --> 20:48.664
And it was-- As a child,
I was afraid in the situation.

20:48.998 --> 20:52.128
<i>He said to my mother,</i>
<i>"You wanna know why I drink?</i>

20:52.209 --> 20:56.049
Because we killed a woman
and we put her behind the shop."

20:56.589 --> 21:01.139
<i>I think my mother believes that my family,</i>
<i>my uncle, had something to do with it.</i>

21:01.635 --> 21:04.505
And maybe my father was speaking
about something he knew.

21:06.557 --> 21:07.887
<i>I will never forget that.</i>

21:10.019 --> 21:14.439
<i>When you take a look at where she lived</i>
<i>and where she was found,</i>

21:14.982 --> 21:17.442
<i>it's just too many coincidences.</i>

21:19.487 --> 21:23.117
So, this is where Sister Cathy lived
and my Uncle Bill was right here.

21:23.908 --> 21:24.868
[Abbie] Jeez.

21:25.367 --> 21:28.657
[Sharon] It's like about ten steps
to my uncle's apartment

21:28.746 --> 21:30.826
when he lived in this complex.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.343
So, this was my uncle's apartment
right here,

21:36.420 --> 21:38.510
this ground-level apartment, the patio.

21:38.589 --> 21:42.719
That's basically the same as it was,
and my brother and I would play out here.

21:43.219 --> 21:47.259
And Sister Cathy's apartment
is directly through that partition,

21:47.348 --> 21:50.098
which was not there at the time.
That was open walkway.

21:50.184 --> 21:52.774
Literally ten steps from my uncle's door.

21:53.521 --> 21:57.901
Her car was parked right there
in the opening of that driveway.

21:58.192 --> 22:01.072
As a matter of fact, if you--
When you pull the--

22:01.153 --> 22:03.823
<i>The first newspaper clipping</i>
<i>that announced this,</i>

22:04.114 --> 22:06.334
<i>when they show where her car was parked,</i>

22:06.408 --> 22:11.158
<i>you actually will see my uncle's apartment</i>
<i>in the same newspaper clipping.</i>

22:12.331 --> 22:14.121
<i>It literally is just a sprint.</i>

22:15.459 --> 22:18.169
-Done. You know what I mean? It's--
-Yeah. And it was dark.

22:18.254 --> 22:20.304
-It was like 8:30 or so.
-[Sharon] Yeah.

22:20.965 --> 22:24.965
We have Billy Schmidt living
in the end apartment here,

22:25.678 --> 22:27.048
right near Sister Cathy.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.886
And we have Edgar Davidson trolling

22:29.974 --> 22:33.144
<i>to pick young girls</i>
<i>at Rock Glen Middle School.</i>

22:33.852 --> 22:38.402
<i>And police were looking for a white man</i>
<i>with dark hair driving a red sports car</i>

22:38.607 --> 22:42.357
<i>because he was trying to pick up</i>
<i>the young girls leaving the middle school</i>

22:42.444 --> 22:44.614
<i>to get them to go for rides</i>
<i>in the car with him.</i>

22:44.697 --> 22:48.117
So, they were certainly
in the same geographical area here.

22:56.417 --> 22:58.787
[line ringing]

22:58.877 --> 23:00.627
-[Barbara] <i>Hello.</i>
-Hey, it's me.

23:00.796 --> 23:03.466
-<i>Yeah.</i>
-So, I've got you on speaker.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.629
-Can you talk?
-<i>Okay.</i>

23:05.718 --> 23:08.968
So, we were just talking about, um...

23:09.722 --> 23:13.312
you know, how this has always been,
like, a subject in our family,

23:13.392 --> 23:15.062
like, an unspoken subject?

23:15.436 --> 23:16.346
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

23:16.437 --> 23:19.357
<i>So, I always kind of felt that...</i>

23:21.066 --> 23:25.816
<i>one or two of our family members</i>
<i>might have had something to do with it.</i>

23:26.363 --> 23:29.533
Can you elaborate then
on why you feel that way?

23:29.867 --> 23:35.787
<i>Well, because my husband,</i>
<i>your father, never, ever was a drinker.</i>

23:36.457 --> 23:41.417
<i>And then, one day, all of a sudden,</i>
<i>he decided he was gonna be a drinker.</i>

23:41.503 --> 23:45.053
So, you think he started drinking
because he knew about that murder,

23:45.132 --> 23:46.472
is that what you're saying?

23:46.550 --> 23:49.050
<i>Yeah. I think it--</i>
<i>It weighed on his conscience.</i>

23:49.136 --> 23:55.726
<i>And I think your Uncle Bill</i>
<i>called your father to come help him.</i>

23:55.809 --> 23:57.899
<i>And he went and he helped him.</i>

23:58.395 --> 24:00.725
<i>And I think</i>
<i>that's where the blood came from.</i>

24:00.814 --> 24:01.694
[Sharon] Mm-hm.

24:01.774 --> 24:05.534
<i>And I think we just never talked about it</i>
<i>because it was better not to know.</i>

24:07.613 --> 24:09.573
[Sharon] All right.
I'll talk to you later.

24:09.657 --> 24:10.987
-[Barbara] <i>All right. Bye.</i>
-Bye.

24:12.034 --> 24:13.834
[Sharon] <i>You should talk to my mother.</i>

24:15.537 --> 24:17.287
I mean, you heard what she said.

24:31.428 --> 24:33.428
[dog barking]

24:36.016 --> 24:38.056
[Barbara] They're not gonna care. Come on.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.480
Come on. They're not gonna care.

24:41.355 --> 24:43.685
Come on. They're not gonna care. Come on.

24:43.899 --> 24:46.189
Come on. You can get up here. Come on.

24:46.276 --> 24:47.606
[dog barking]

24:47.695 --> 24:49.905
[Barbara] <i>I have five Yorkies.</i>

24:49.988 --> 24:51.068
Hey, hey, no, no.

24:51.156 --> 24:54.906
<i>The other one's an English Spangler</i>
<i>and the other one is a dachshund.</i>

24:55.411 --> 24:57.411
<i>And the other one is a boxer.</i>

24:58.163 --> 24:59.213
Hey.

24:59.289 --> 25:00.289
Shh, shh.

25:00.374 --> 25:01.584
Quiet. Quiet.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.337
<i>I don't raise a hand to them.</i>

25:03.585 --> 25:05.875
<i>The most I say is "be quiet"</i>
<i>and "shut up."</i>

25:06.255 --> 25:07.085
No.

25:07.965 --> 25:08.965
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

25:09.049 --> 25:09.879
No. No.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.762
<i>And my parrot is a yellow-nape.</i>

25:15.931 --> 25:17.061
<i>She's 40 years old.</i>

25:17.725 --> 25:20.725
She has a good personality,
but she doesn't like everybody.

25:21.437 --> 25:22.937
She'll pretend she does.

25:23.939 --> 25:26.069
She only likes one person and that's me.

25:26.442 --> 25:27.652
She hates my husband.

25:27.735 --> 25:30.485
She'll chase him 50 miles
just to get a little nibble.

25:32.156 --> 25:35.826
Now, I have more pictures,
but I have no idea where they are.

25:37.494 --> 25:42.464
My daughter, Sharon,
about two years old, two and a half.

25:43.292 --> 25:48.382
And then that was my son Brian
when he was 12, 13, 14 months old.

25:48.922 --> 25:53.512
Ronald Schmidt, my ex-husband that
I was married to for 24 and a half years,

25:53.802 --> 25:55.142
<i>my children's father.</i>

25:55.888 --> 26:00.928
There's me with Sharon
at the Schmidt house on Monumental Avenue.

26:02.352 --> 26:05.272
See, I've got a lot of pictures here
of the Schmidt household,

26:05.355 --> 26:06.895
you can see they're missing.

26:08.734 --> 26:10.444
Now, here's a picture of Bill.

26:12.488 --> 26:16.578
The only picture... that I know of.

26:16.658 --> 26:17.488
[dogs barking]

26:17.576 --> 26:19.996
William Charles Schmidt.

26:20.078 --> 26:21.288
Shh!

26:21.371 --> 26:22.541
Known as Billy.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.343
Back then,
he was the best friend I ever had.

26:27.419 --> 26:30.049
He was like a knight in shining armor
for me.

26:30.798 --> 26:33.628
Kind, gentle soul, but strange.

26:33.717 --> 26:35.837
He had very weird ways.

26:36.762 --> 26:40.392
<i>After I had my daughter,</i>
<i>he always came home for lunch,</i>

26:40.474 --> 26:44.194
<i>and he would say, "Come on, girl.</i>
<i>Let's get back in shape."</i>

26:44.269 --> 26:46.939
<i>And we'd go in the living room</i>
<i>and he'd turn on the stereo</i>

26:47.022 --> 26:49.072
<i>and we do the twist for half an hour.</i>

26:53.570 --> 26:56.820
And he'd say, "You're not gonna get
in shape just sitting there.

26:56.907 --> 26:59.197
You just had a baby. Let's twist."

27:00.452 --> 27:03.082
<i>I married his brother,</i>
<i>Ronald Francis Schmidt.</i>

27:03.413 --> 27:07.843
<i>We met when we were like 11 years old,</i>
<i>and we got married at 16.</i>

27:09.044 --> 27:12.594
<i>My father-in-law, he didn't think</i>
<i>I was good enough for his family.</i>

27:13.090 --> 27:14.170
<i>They never liked me.</i>

27:15.050 --> 27:18.640
<i>They didn't care too much for Bill either</i>
<i>because of his lifestyle.</i>

27:19.763 --> 27:21.723
<i>He was gay.</i>

27:22.266 --> 27:24.636
Back then, we're talking early '60s,

27:25.018 --> 27:27.308
that was not talked about,
it was hush-hush.

27:27.396 --> 27:28.726
It was kept in the closet.

27:30.190 --> 27:32.190
<i>That whole environment</i>
<i>really messed him up.</i>

27:33.318 --> 27:35.108
<i>Billy couldn't stand it anymore.</i>

27:35.487 --> 27:36.777
<i>He went and got an apartment.</i>

27:38.615 --> 27:41.285
Bill used to talk
about the nun across the hall

27:41.827 --> 27:44.327
saying that she was pretty,
that she was nice.

27:44.955 --> 27:47.415
<i>I met her one time, he introduced her.</i>

27:47.499 --> 27:50.209
<i>He said, "This is my neighbor,</i>
<i>Sister Catherine."</i>

27:52.713 --> 27:57.263
<i>I find it very coincidental that she lived</i>
<i>across the hall from my brother-in-law</i>

27:57.342 --> 28:00.222
<i>and was found very close</i>
<i>to the family home.</i>

28:02.180 --> 28:04.350
<i>Not only was it behind the home,</i>

28:04.433 --> 28:07.813
it was behind the family business,
by the railroad tracks

28:07.895 --> 28:11.605
between the business and the house.

28:12.149 --> 28:14.069
<i>There was all these woods in between.</i>

28:14.860 --> 28:17.320
<i>Bill definitely knew the area.</i>

28:19.781 --> 28:22.741
<i>Well, one night,</i>
<i>my husband worked the night shift.</i>

28:23.410 --> 28:25.870
<i>And when he came home,</i>
<i>he had blood on him.</i>

28:27.122 --> 28:29.122
Blood on his hands, blood on his shirt.

28:29.666 --> 28:31.626
I asked him,
"Ronnie, where you been?"

28:32.127 --> 28:33.417
He said, "Don't worry about it."

28:33.962 --> 28:36.842
<i>And I kept badgering him,</i>
<i>"Where have you been?"</i>

28:37.466 --> 28:39.256
<i>He said, "I was in a bar fight."</i>

28:40.010 --> 28:42.680
<i>I knew he wasn't,</i>
<i>he didn't have a scratch on him.</i>

28:43.388 --> 28:47.388
He just had blood on his hands,
his forearms, and his shirt.

28:48.310 --> 28:52.190
So, I knew he'd been into something,
but it wasn't a fight.

28:53.106 --> 28:55.976
<i>He was, like, the perfect dad,</i>
<i>the perfect husband.</i>

28:56.235 --> 28:59.485
After the nun died, everything changed.

28:59.571 --> 29:02.781
Started drinking, doing drugs,
acting crazy.

29:04.493 --> 29:05.833
It changed our lives.

29:07.913 --> 29:08.963
Just like with Bill.

29:13.210 --> 29:14.880
<i>Bill became a hermit.</i>

29:15.337 --> 29:17.337
<i>He did not go to work anymore.</i>

29:17.422 --> 29:20.552
Stayed in the house,
didn't drive his car...

29:22.010 --> 29:24.550
didn't see any family or friends...

29:24.846 --> 29:25.926
started...

29:27.849 --> 29:29.769
talking about the woman in the attic.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.981
<i>After the nun was murdered,</i>
<i>he was obsessed with it.</i>

29:36.483 --> 29:38.193
<i>He'd talk about it all the time.</i>

29:38.902 --> 29:41.452
<i>He would say,</i>
<i>"Can you believe somebody killed her?</i>

29:41.530 --> 29:43.570
<i>Can you believe where they found her?"</i>

29:43.740 --> 29:47.620
I mean, he would just go on
and on and on and on.

29:48.996 --> 29:52.616
<i>This guy named Skippy</i>
<i>was a friend of my brother-in-law Bill's.</i>

29:52.916 --> 29:57.296
I was introduced to him as Skippy,
never another name.

29:57.379 --> 30:00.589
I have no idea
what his first or last name was.

30:00.757 --> 30:02.547
<i>Only thing I know about is</i>

30:02.801 --> 30:06.681
<i>I think they started out as friends</i>
<i>and I think they ended up as lovers.</i>

30:10.100 --> 30:14.730
<i>The two of them, this guy named Skippy</i>
<i>and my brother-in-law Bill,</i>

30:15.272 --> 30:19.152
were obsessed with the Catholic Church,
but I don't know why.

30:19.568 --> 30:20.898
Bill wasn't Catholic.

30:21.445 --> 30:26.865
Him and Skippy dressed up
and went parading down Baltimore Street,

30:27.659 --> 30:32.539
one dressed as a priest,
one dressed us a nun, a pregnant nun.

30:36.418 --> 30:39.378
<i>I used to work for Western Electric</i>
<i>on Broening Highway,</i>

30:39.463 --> 30:42.303
<i>and I worked the night shift.</i>
<i>I worked 4:30 to 1.</i>

30:42.841 --> 30:45.681
<i>Well, this one particular night,</i>
<i>and it was wintertime,</i>

30:46.178 --> 30:48.848
<i>came through the tunnel</i>
<i>and I'd seen headlights behind me,</i>

30:48.930 --> 30:50.810
<i>but I didn't think anything about it.</i>

30:52.017 --> 30:55.307
<i>And this car pulled up alongside of me</i>
<i>that had been following me,</i>

30:55.395 --> 30:58.605
<i>and I just had the feeling</i>
<i>that somebody was staring at me.</i>

30:59.608 --> 31:01.438
<i>So, I glanced over.</i>

31:02.069 --> 31:03.109
And when I did...

31:04.029 --> 31:08.279
it was this blue older station wagon
with this nun driving it,

31:08.492 --> 31:10.162
only it wasn't a nun at all.

31:11.119 --> 31:15.869
<i>It was somebody with a big old mustache</i>
<i>grinning from ear to ear at me.</i>

31:16.833 --> 31:19.543
<i>So, when that light turned green,</i>
<i>I took off.</i>

31:20.087 --> 31:22.047
<i>I went through red lights and everything.</i>

31:22.130 --> 31:24.550
<i>When I got down to Ritchie Highway</i>
<i>and Mountain Road</i>

31:24.633 --> 31:27.973
<i>where they come together,</i>
<i>that car was right on my bumper.</i>

31:28.345 --> 31:30.805
<i>So, I took off in front of traffic</i>

31:31.098 --> 31:34.228
<i>and that person in that station wagon</i>
<i>got stuck...</i>

31:35.644 --> 31:36.774
<i>and I was hysterical.</i>

31:37.270 --> 31:39.400
<i>I pulled into my driveway,</i>
<i>ran into my house.</i>

31:39.481 --> 31:43.401
<i>My babysitter was in there, and I</i>
<i>started screaming, "Call the police!"</i>

31:43.777 --> 31:46.657
And to this day, I believe it was Skippy.

31:47.697 --> 31:49.447
Definitely was a man.

31:50.534 --> 31:54.504
I don't know many women that have
big thick mustaches, but Skippy did.

31:55.789 --> 31:58.789
I couldn't see enough of the face
to say for sure,

31:59.084 --> 32:01.254
but I know it wasn't Bill.

32:01.837 --> 32:04.757
<i>That guy Skippy.</i>
<i>Maybe he thought I knew something.</i>

32:04.923 --> 32:06.683
Maybe he thought I knew too much.

32:06.758 --> 32:07.878
I don't know nothing.

32:09.469 --> 32:13.849
<i>It got so bad, Bill had to move back home</i>
<i>to get away from that apartment.</i>

32:14.599 --> 32:16.979
<i>He would drink,</i>
<i>take pills, stay up all day,</i>

32:17.060 --> 32:20.020
walk the floors all night
and talk about the woman in the attic.

32:20.522 --> 32:22.572
And that's how I discovered
it was up there,

32:22.649 --> 32:25.899
because I wanted to prove to him
there's no woman in the attic.

32:28.029 --> 32:31.409
<i>And I went up there and I go,</i>
<i>"What woman are you talking about?"</i>

32:33.076 --> 32:34.786
<i>He goes, "Don't you see her?"</i>

32:46.006 --> 32:47.756
<i>And it was on a mannequin.</i>

32:49.009 --> 32:51.429
And it was blue with a white band.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.555
It was a nun's habit.

32:58.143 --> 32:59.773
<i>He'd say she was after him...</i>

33:00.896 --> 33:04.856
<i>she was chasing him,</i>
<i>she would talk to him.</i>

33:07.027 --> 33:09.197
<i>The whole thing, it was very bizarre.</i>

33:09.988 --> 33:11.068
Everything about it.

33:12.407 --> 33:15.617
<i>Once the murder happened,</i>
<i>he became a very tortured soul.</i>

33:18.079 --> 33:20.829
<i>I think he couldn't live</i>
<i>with his conscience anymore.</i>

33:23.585 --> 33:25.375
After the nun was murdered,

33:26.087 --> 33:30.127
I'd say probably maybe three,
four, or five months later,

33:30.884 --> 33:32.394
he tried to commit suicide.

33:33.762 --> 33:35.602
Numerous times, like five.

33:36.765 --> 33:38.975
And each time he would try it,
he'd call me up.

33:40.727 --> 33:44.607
<i>His sixth and final time</i>
<i>that he tried it, he succeeded.</i>

33:46.149 --> 33:49.069
<i>He did call me, but he called to tell me,</i>

33:49.152 --> 33:52.662
<i>"Goodbye.</i>
<i>I wanted to tell you that I love you.</i>

33:53.823 --> 33:57.293
And I can't deal with--
I can't deal with this no more."

33:57.786 --> 34:00.286
And I go, "What are you talking about?"
And he hung up.

34:01.540 --> 34:04.880
<i>He had taken 49 sleeping pills</i>
<i>and drank booze.</i>

34:05.669 --> 34:06.499
<i>He was dead.</i>

34:07.796 --> 34:09.335
<i>He was 42 years old.</i>

34:11.800 --> 34:12.840
<i>He knew something.</i>

34:15.219 --> 34:17.179
<i>That secret went to the grave with him.</i>

34:19.349 --> 34:21.018
<i>I don't know about Skippy.</i>

34:21.810 --> 34:25.230
<i>I couldn't tell you where he is</i>
<i>or if he's dead or not, don't know.</i>

34:25.522 --> 34:28.402
Skippy sort of, like, just disappeared.

34:28.817 --> 34:30.987
Nobody seen or heard from Skippy anymore.

34:31.235 --> 34:34.156
It was like everybody
went their separate ways.

34:35.739 --> 34:37.080
-[squawks]
-[dog barks]

34:52.047 --> 34:52.967
[Gemma] Okay.

34:53.507 --> 34:56.388
I went crazy with these little papers.
Anyway...

34:56.928 --> 35:03.768
Jane Doe was allegedly taken to the dump

35:04.227 --> 35:06.227
and saw Cathy's body.

35:07.981 --> 35:10.441
<i>She was taken by Joseph Maskell.</i>

35:11.192 --> 35:13.032
<i>And when she got there,</i>

35:13.612 --> 35:18.332
<i>she saw Sister Cathy's body</i>
<i>and he leaned over to her and said,</i>

35:18.867 --> 35:22.077
"This is what happens
when you say bad things about people."

35:22.162 --> 35:25.672
There's somebody named Bob
in this whole mix,

35:26.291 --> 35:31.631
according to Jane Doe,
that is also significant...

35:31.713 --> 35:33.593
in Cathy's murder.

35:33.673 --> 35:34.513
Okay?

35:35.342 --> 35:37.222
-[Abbie] I think Jane is the key...
-[Gemma] Yeah.

35:37.302 --> 35:39.142
-...to solving the whole thing.
-Absolutely.

35:39.220 --> 35:43.730
Because if you accept her memories
as valid,

35:43.808 --> 35:46.898
and, initially, I was unsure,
but I'm beginning to come around

35:46.978 --> 35:48.808
to thinking that they are.

35:48.897 --> 35:50.267
With no disrespect for her,

35:50.357 --> 35:55.647
I'm just a very data-driven,
proof-driven sort of person.

35:57.822 --> 36:04.292
I see no reason for her to subject herself
to this public stress and humiliation...

36:06.373 --> 36:07.543
if it's not the truth.

36:12.462 --> 36:18.012
<i>There's no sense that this is something</i>
<i>that she enjoys or that she wants to do.</i>

36:18.093 --> 36:23.393
<i>She doesn't reach out, she doesn't post</i>
<i>about being upset or needing support.</i>

36:25.266 --> 36:27.596
[Gemma] <i>My feeling is she's very guarded,</i>

36:27.936 --> 36:33.526
but she's very determined
to work through this step-by-step

36:34.275 --> 36:37.485
with her support system around her.

36:51.751 --> 36:56.051
[Jane] <i>Mike's love for me held me</i>
<i>from totally falling into the abyss.</i>

36:58.550 --> 37:00.720
<i>I had that feeling of protection.</i>

37:02.429 --> 37:06.729
<i>He believed in me, he trusted me,</i>
<i>he knew the kind of person I was.</i>

37:10.895 --> 37:14.185
[Sarah] I'll let you each take a turn,
but if you had to sort of--

37:14.733 --> 37:20.493
What's the word?
Like, the secret to a 33-year marriage...

37:21.656 --> 37:22.986
what would you say, Mom?

37:23.366 --> 37:24.486
I'll let him start.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.076
-Oh, okay. Dad.
-We survived.

37:26.161 --> 37:27.001
Yeah.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.368
[laughing]

37:29.205 --> 37:30.995
[Mike] <i>Back then, even back then,</i>

37:31.082 --> 37:34.962
as big of a knucklehead as I was,
and I didn't know shit from Shinola,

37:35.044 --> 37:38.514
I knew your mother was a strong woman
and I wanted to spend my life with her.

37:38.590 --> 37:39.470
I knew that.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.298
I knew it. I could tell.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.511
I could tell she was just different.

37:45.305 --> 37:48.135
<i>I was like,</i>
<i>"I ain't letting this relationship die."</i>

37:50.810 --> 37:54.730
Each time there was a major ordeal,
everything would fall on the ground,

37:54.814 --> 37:58.654
and I would just think,
"What in the world would I do if he died?"

38:00.612 --> 38:03.412
<i>My husband, Mike,</i>
<i>swallowed a lot of anger.</i>

38:03.490 --> 38:07.910
<i>There was a lot of anger</i>
<i>that he wanted to express.</i>

38:08.244 --> 38:11.464
In those 21 hours of depositions,
it was with him sitting there.

38:11.539 --> 38:14.749
He could not open his mouth
or he would have to leave the room.

38:16.461 --> 38:20.091
That's swallowing an awful lot
of what he was hearing

38:20.340 --> 38:22.470
and what they were saying to me.

38:23.259 --> 38:25.679
Being in a courtroom
and seeing me go through that,

38:25.762 --> 38:27.722
not being able to be up there with me,

38:27.806 --> 38:31.176
there was no way he could deal with it,
there was nothing he would do,

38:31.267 --> 38:34.597
'cause he wasn't gonna go against
my wishes and he wasn't gonna hurt me

38:34.687 --> 38:37.767
by doing something
that would scare me more.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.356
So, he swallowed it and he swallowed it.

38:41.861 --> 38:43.821
<i>And he ended up with esophageal cancer.</i>

38:49.160 --> 38:52.250
<i>"Who is this man</i>
<i>who sits before me scared and real?</i>

38:52.789 --> 38:55.749
Who is this man
who feels like a fish out of water,

38:56.125 --> 38:59.795
unable to help another
for lack of physical strength?

39:00.630 --> 39:05.760
Build something, move something,
re-create, or better yet create something.

39:06.803 --> 39:08.973
This man is the strongest man I know."

39:11.391 --> 39:17.021
"He was my eyes when I couldn't see.
He was my legs when I couldn't walk.

39:17.438 --> 39:22.398
He was my protective shield
when I was at my most vulnerable.

39:22.944 --> 39:27.324
<i>He was my fist</i>
<i>when I didn't even know I had hands.</i>

39:28.032 --> 39:32.412
<i>He believed I was good</i>
<i>when everything in me screamed 'harlot.'</i>

39:34.831 --> 39:37.081
<i>This man, Mike, is my soul mate."</i>

39:38.001 --> 39:42.881
"The man I love through sickness,
though richer or poorer, forever."

40:03.735 --> 40:09.405
<i>When my husband died, I was terrified,</i>
<i>because now I didn't have my protector.</i>

40:10.909 --> 40:14.999
<i>I don't know where I would have ended up</i>
<i>if my husband hadn't come into my life.</i>

40:16.122 --> 40:17.212
<i>He was my rock.</i>

40:23.338 --> 40:26.628
[Gemma] <i>We've talked to a lot of people</i>
<i>who have shared with us</i>

40:26.716 --> 40:32.756
<i>that Maskell moved in a really</i>
<i>sleazy group of men in Baltimore.</i>

40:34.599 --> 40:40.479
It's very possible
that in referring to someone, Brother Bob,

40:40.813 --> 40:42.483
that could have been anybody.

40:43.024 --> 40:47.824
<i>It could have been Edgar Davidson.</i>
<i>It could have been Billy Schmidt.</i>

40:47.904 --> 40:51.574
<i>It could have been a police officer,</i>
<i>another priest.</i>

40:51.908 --> 40:57.868
<i>This network that he had</i>
<i>of people that had something to lose</i>

40:58.331 --> 41:01.711
<i>would have supported him</i>
<i>and covered for him</i>

41:01.793 --> 41:05.423
because he was protecting them,
they were protecting him.

41:06.130 --> 41:07.670
<i>Who knows how far this went?</i>

41:11.761 --> 41:12.971
We're here.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.351
-[Gemma] How are you, Mare?
-I'm good.

41:15.431 --> 41:17.771
-Good. Real good, Gemma.
-[Gemma] Thank you for doing this.

41:17.850 --> 41:19.520
-Oh, no problem.
-[Gemma] Yeah.

41:20.478 --> 41:23.768
[Gary] Okay, let's take a look
as we go here.

41:28.444 --> 41:32.994
And it actually is a colored rhinestone.

41:33.449 --> 41:34.739
So, it's not a peridot.

41:36.786 --> 41:39.116
The stone is a green glass,

41:39.205 --> 41:42.665
but to give it some brightness
they put a little foil backing.

41:43.710 --> 41:48.420
These foil backs kind of died out
by the '70s.

41:48.965 --> 41:51.875
I mean, it's not a high-selling stone.

41:52.552 --> 41:57.312
People only buy this color
because of it being an August birthstone.

41:58.766 --> 42:01.476
This kind of almost looks handmade.

42:02.311 --> 42:05.111
I don't know if it's designed like that
or got bent,

42:05.356 --> 42:09.236
you know, in terms of the one going up
and the one going down.

42:09.318 --> 42:14.278
And then this piece
is an old-style pendant thing

42:14.365 --> 42:16.945
that I don't even think
they've made in 30 years.

42:17.910 --> 42:20.750
And maybe the guy just had these parts
lying around and said,

42:20.830 --> 42:24.130
"Hey, I can put this together for you,"
and just did it real quick.

42:26.294 --> 42:32.094
[Gemma] <i>I think the most important things</i>
<i>that I took away from the gemologist was,</i>

42:32.175 --> 42:35.335
<i>first of all,</i>
<i>the materials that went into it.</i>

42:35.678 --> 42:38.468
There were quite a few different kinds
of metal were typical

42:38.556 --> 42:41.926
of what was being used in the '60s
for jewelry,

42:42.310 --> 42:46.110
and that it was not
an expensive piece of jewelry.

42:46.606 --> 42:50.986
<i>He gave an estimate of about ten to $15.</i>

42:51.277 --> 42:53.027
<i>And probably in the '60s,</i>

42:53.112 --> 42:55.912
that would have been a lot of money
on a teacher's salary.

42:56.491 --> 42:59.541
<i>So, the fact that it was custom-made,</i>

42:59.702 --> 43:03.292
<i>I can see her at a counter with a jeweler</i>

43:03.456 --> 43:06.786
<i>talking about</i>
<i>what she would like it to mean.</i>

43:07.460 --> 43:12.840
Cathy was the kind of person that
nothing was too small to not have meaning.

43:12.924 --> 43:14.384
She was very creative,

43:14.675 --> 43:19.135
very purposeful in her words,
in her poetry, in her teaching.

43:19.430 --> 43:20.770
<i>So, that, to me,</i>

43:20.848 --> 43:26.188
<i>something that she could give someone else</i>
<i>would have to have meaning.</i>

43:26.687 --> 43:30.777
<i>If only we could find</i>
<i>someone in the family</i>

43:30.983 --> 43:33.113
<i>who could identify the necklace,</i>

43:34.070 --> 43:37.450
it would be a whole new avenue
for us to explore

43:37.532 --> 43:39.532
and hopefully find some answers.

43:45.998 --> 43:48.918
[Sharon] <i>When the case was reopened</i>
<i>in the '90s,</i>

43:49.127 --> 43:52.207
<i>I was doing the dishes one night</i>
<i>watching the six o'clock news,</i>

43:52.296 --> 43:54.506
<i>and it came on</i>
<i>that they reopened the case.</i>

43:54.924 --> 43:56.884
[man] <i>On November 7, 1969,</i>

43:56.968 --> 43:59.888
<i>Cathy Cesnik was abducted</i>
<i>while getting out of her car</i>

43:59.971 --> 44:02.681
<i>at her apartment complex</i>
<i>where she lived in Catonsville.</i>

44:03.182 --> 44:06.232
<i>She turned up murdered</i>
<i>in a field in Lansdowne.</i>

44:06.894 --> 44:09.234
[Sharon] <i>I was flooded</i>
<i>with childhood memories.</i>

44:09.313 --> 44:12.983
<i>Like the time when my father</i>
<i>came home very inebriated</i>

44:13.067 --> 44:16.607
<i>and he was yelling at my mother saying,</i>
<i>"Do you wanna know why I drink?</i>

44:16.696 --> 44:20.196
<i>Because I killed a woman.</i>
<i>We put her behind the shop."</i>

44:21.492 --> 44:24.082
<i>I used to beg my father</i>
<i>before my father died</i>

44:24.370 --> 44:27.000
<i>and I would just ask him</i>
<i>over and over and over again,</i>

44:27.081 --> 44:29.541
and the only answer
I could ever get from my father was,

44:29.625 --> 44:31.995
"Shar, just leave it alone.

44:32.170 --> 44:35.050
It's just one of those things,
you should just leave it alone."

44:35.131 --> 44:38.261
He never said, "Oh, my God.
You're so ridiculous. How-- "

44:38.509 --> 44:39.759
He didn't do that.

44:40.553 --> 44:46.233
<i>After my brother's death,</i>
<i>Abbie sent me my brother's interview.</i>

44:46.309 --> 44:49.899
And I never knew
until I listened to that interview

44:50.146 --> 44:53.146
that this subject plagued my brother.

44:53.232 --> 44:54.152
I never knew it.

44:54.233 --> 44:56.903
We never, ever once discussed it.

44:56.986 --> 44:59.106
Did you hear the interview?
You've heard it?

44:59.196 --> 45:02.776
So, you hear
how it plagued my brother also.

45:03.034 --> 45:04.414
I had no idea.

45:06.495 --> 45:07.745
[line ringing on recording]

45:08.706 --> 45:10.416
-[Brian] <i>Hello.</i>
-[Alan] <i>Brian?</i>

45:10.917 --> 45:11.787
[Brian] <i>Who's this?</i>

45:11.876 --> 45:13.416
[Alan] <i>My name's Alan Horn.</i>

45:13.711 --> 45:18.881
<i>You don't know me,</i>
<i>but your mother suggested that I call you.</i>

45:19.550 --> 45:22.390
<i>I'm an armchair researcher</i>

45:22.470 --> 45:25.180
<i>that's working</i>
<i>on this Sister Cathy Cesnik story.</i>

45:27.141 --> 45:28.561
[Brian] <i>It's about time.</i>

45:30.603 --> 45:32.983
<i>Okay. Well, I could close this case.</i>

45:33.481 --> 45:36.481
<i>If I just explained a few things,</i>

45:37.276 --> 45:40.856
<i>but I'm gonna tell you, I was there,</i>
<i>except for her murder.</i>

45:41.948 --> 45:43.318
<i>Can that help you any?</i>

45:43.866 --> 45:44.776
[Alan] <i>Oh, absolutely.</i>

45:44.867 --> 45:47.447
<i>I mean, we know that</i>
<i>your Uncle Billy lived across the hall,</i>

45:47.536 --> 45:51.246
-<i>we know your Uncle Bob--</i>
<i>-Look. No, stop, stop, stop.</i>

45:51.332 --> 45:52.172
[Alan] <i>Go ahead.</i>

45:52.917 --> 45:55.167
[Brian] <i>I'm gonna tell you</i>
<i>exactly where we're at.</i>

45:55.252 --> 45:56.252
-[Alan] <i>Okay.</i>
-[Brian] <i>Yes,</i>

45:56.337 --> 45:57.667
<i>Uncle Billy lived across the hall.</i>

45:57.755 --> 46:00.545
<i>It was like, sort of walked--</i>
<i>Like, to the right.</i>

46:00.633 --> 46:05.603
<i>And I was in her apartment</i>
<i>and my Uncle Bill was there.</i>

46:06.138 --> 46:10.018
<i>My Uncle Bill sent me</i>
<i>back to his apartment.</i>

46:10.476 --> 46:14.856
<i>And the way I can picture in my memory is,</i>
<i>I was there for quite a while, and...</i>

46:15.773 --> 46:18.693
<i>I went looking for my uncle,</i>
<i>but when I found my uncle,</i>

46:18.776 --> 46:22.486
<i>he rushed me back to the apartment</i>
<i>and shut her door.</i>

46:24.031 --> 46:26.161
<i>What I can tell you is...</i>

46:27.201 --> 46:28.201
[Brian sighs]

46:31.080 --> 46:37.130
<i>my Uncle Bill called a guy named Skippy.</i>
<i>Black hair, mustache.</i>

46:37.670 --> 46:40.590
<i>He came.</i>
<i>They both went over to her apartment.</i>

46:41.048 --> 46:45.138
<i>They came back with what looked like</i>
<i>something rolled up, a rug or a blanket.</i>

46:45.219 --> 46:46.639
<i>It was rolled up, okay?</i>

46:47.138 --> 46:47.968
[Alan] <i>Mm-hm.</i>

46:48.055 --> 46:51.175
[Brian] <i>They said, "We gotta load this</i>
<i>in the car, we'll be right back."</i>

46:52.101 --> 46:56.271
<i>Then my Uncle Bill and Skippy</i>
<i>went and picked up my Uncle Bobby.</i>

46:56.355 --> 47:00.025
<i>And my Uncle Bobby took me with a .22</i>

47:00.568 --> 47:02.778
<i>over there behind my grandma's place,</i>

47:03.320 --> 47:05.740
<i>behind the big house</i>
<i>back there in the woods.</i>

47:06.073 --> 47:10.663
<i>And while Bobby was shooting the gun</i>
<i>in the woods to keep me occupied...</i>

47:12.121 --> 47:15.961
<i>I'm watching them two</i>
<i>load this out of the trunk.</i>

47:18.044 --> 47:21.964
<i>And I kept saying to Uncle Bobby,</i>
<i>"Why don't they just throw that in here?"</i>

47:23.674 --> 47:26.474
<i>'Cause we were standing there</i>
<i>shooting at a trash pile.</i>

47:27.178 --> 47:29.468
[Alan] <i>What was she wrapped in?</i>
<i>Do you remember?</i>

47:30.514 --> 47:33.104
[Brian] <i>It looked like a big blanket</i>
<i>or something.</i>

47:33.184 --> 47:36.154
<i>It was white, if I'm not mistaken.</i>
<i>White or beige.</i>

47:37.104 --> 47:38.194
<i>See, look, I was a kid</i>

47:38.272 --> 47:41.402
<i>and I don't remember no one</i>
<i>getting murdered or nothing.</i>

47:41.650 --> 47:43.610
-[Alan] <i>Mm-hm.</i>
-[Brian] <i>But then I grew up.</i>

47:44.070 --> 47:48.240
<i>And as I grew up,</i>
<i>I realized that my Uncle Bill did it,</i>

47:48.407 --> 47:52.367
<i>Skippy covered it up,</i>
<i>and Uncle Bobby kept me occupied.</i>

47:53.788 --> 47:57.368
<i>My Uncle Bill said if I told anybody,</i>

47:57.458 --> 48:00.338
<i>he would beat me to death</i>
<i>and he would hurt me bad,</i>

48:00.419 --> 48:04.669
<i>and I was not to ever tell anybody</i>
<i>anything or I would be killed.</i>

48:05.925 --> 48:10.465
<i>Those are memories that are</i>
<i>burned in my brain that I can't...</i>

48:11.263 --> 48:13.393
<i>I can't point the finger and blame nobody.</i>

48:13.474 --> 48:16.814
<i>I can just tell you what I saw,</i>
<i>how I saw it, who I saw it with,</i>

48:16.894 --> 48:18.444
<i>and when it happened, period.</i>

48:19.647 --> 48:22.317
<i>Nobody wanted to listen, you know, so...</i>

48:23.776 --> 48:27.066
<i>Look, this is all a child's memory</i>
<i>that's in an old man's mind.</i>

48:27.154 --> 48:28.954
<i>I'm just trying to tell you that.</i>

48:29.031 --> 48:30.661
<i>That's the best I can give you.</i>

48:42.962 --> 48:44.262
[Sharon] <i>I had no idea.</i>

48:44.421 --> 48:45.921
<i>I had no idea.</i>

48:46.549 --> 48:50.219
And, of course, I learned that
after my brother's death, so, that, to me,

48:50.302 --> 48:51.552
was pretty hard to take.

48:53.139 --> 48:54.179
It still is.

48:55.266 --> 48:57.806
<i>I guess knowing</i>
<i>that it bothered my brother</i>

48:58.477 --> 49:01.267
to the point that it did,
and he didn't say anything...

49:03.274 --> 49:07.154
and I only learned it after his death,
it just--

49:07.236 --> 49:10.986
To me, it just reiterates
that he was afraid.

49:19.165 --> 49:22.995
[Gemma] <i>Okay. Place on something,</i>
<i>something, bake for ten to 15 minutes.</i>

49:23.085 --> 49:25.245
-<i>I think it'll be okay.</i>
-[man] <i>Checking.</i>

49:28.883 --> 49:30.763
This is why I use a toaster oven.

49:32.052 --> 49:33.142
Oh, my goodness.

49:34.889 --> 49:36.059
What is in there?

49:36.557 --> 49:39.517
What's doing that?
What's smoking like that?

49:40.644 --> 49:42.154
Okay. Where's the fan?

49:43.022 --> 49:43.862
Fan.

49:44.440 --> 49:46.110
Oh, that doesn't work. Shoot.

49:48.235 --> 49:52.025
<i>Less than a month ago,</i>
<i>I got an e-mail from a woman.</i>

49:52.823 --> 49:53.953
"Hi, Gemma.

49:54.033 --> 49:58.163
I saw your name in the article
regarding Sister Cathy Cesnik's murder.

49:58.412 --> 50:00.962
Her sister Marilyn is my best friend.

50:01.207 --> 50:04.377
I know how hard it has been for her
all these years

50:04.460 --> 50:07.920
with not having closure
regarding her sister's murder.

50:08.005 --> 50:11.795
Please let me know if you would be open
to speaking with her

50:11.967 --> 50:14.757
regarding the research
your group has done."

50:16.388 --> 50:17.888
<i>I was just shocked.</i>

50:18.140 --> 50:22.600
The mother of the family had just died,
her name is Ann Cesnik.

50:22.937 --> 50:24.857
And there are three girls.

50:24.939 --> 50:29.149
Marilyn... is taking her time,

50:29.526 --> 50:32.816
and her friend said
that she will communicate with me.

50:32.905 --> 50:35.945
<i>She has my e-mail address</i>
<i>and my phone number.</i>

50:36.992 --> 50:40.252
My feeling is that she will know
who that gift was for,

50:40.788 --> 50:44.748
<i>maybe if the color green</i>
<i>meant something to them.</i>

50:44.959 --> 50:49.259
So, I hope that that's a nugget
of information that will be new for us,

50:49.338 --> 50:51.918
and that she will contact me when it--

50:52.007 --> 50:56.387
When she feels comfortable with it,
probably after the holidays.

51:21.245 --> 51:22.995
[phone ringing]

51:23.581 --> 51:25.121
That's probably my call.

51:27.793 --> 51:28.633
Hello?

51:29.420 --> 51:30.340
[Marilyn] <i>Hi, Gemma?</i>

51:30.421 --> 51:31.921
Hi. Is it Marilyn?

51:32.006 --> 51:34.126
[Marilyn speaks indistinctly]

51:34.216 --> 51:35.676
I'm good. How are you?

51:37.970 --> 51:38.970
Mm-hm.

51:39.054 --> 51:41.064
[Marilyn speaking indistinctly]

51:42.057 --> 51:43.767
No, no, that's okay. You know what?

51:43.976 --> 51:46.146
I-- I totally understand.

51:46.895 --> 51:48.855
That's okay. Just let it go.

51:48.939 --> 51:50.939
Just do-- Just be all over the place.

51:52.359 --> 51:54.609
I have to be honest with you,
I was nervous--

51:54.695 --> 51:57.945
But I thought, "Well, Marilyn's
probably more nervous than I am."

51:58.032 --> 51:59.242
<i>I'm so nervous.</i>

51:59.325 --> 52:00.325
Oh.

52:02.786 --> 52:06.666
I feel so blessed that you even asked
if you could call me.

52:06.749 --> 52:08.129
I mean, I'm so honored,

52:08.417 --> 52:12.377
and I feel really emotional
because you sound like Cathy.

52:12.463 --> 52:13.883
You sound like your sister.

52:14.465 --> 52:19.085
And her voice meant so much to me
because of her--

52:19.178 --> 52:21.308
She's the reason I became a teacher.

52:21.722 --> 52:22.812
<i>I-- I get that.</i>

52:22.890 --> 52:24.640
Yeah. Mm-hm.

52:26.352 --> 52:27.732
<i>Yeah, and you know...</i>

52:27.811 --> 52:29.231
[Marilyn speaking indistinctly]

52:29.313 --> 52:30.403
Oh, my goodness.

52:31.273 --> 52:32.613
But do you think that--?

52:32.691 --> 52:34.691
[Marilyn speaking indistinctly]

52:39.823 --> 52:40.913
Really?

52:45.746 --> 52:47.916
Yeah. I don't have my calendar
in front of me,

52:47.998 --> 52:49.498
but I think I can work that out.

52:49.583 --> 52:52.423
You said you're coming on March ele--

52:54.338 --> 52:56.758
Marilyn, I can't wait
to get together with you.

52:58.717 --> 53:01.717
You're so welcome, sweetie.
All right. I'll talk to you soon.

53:01.804 --> 53:02.934
-Bye.
-[Marilyn] <i>Bye.</i>

53:10.896 --> 53:11.936
Hmm.

53:14.858 --> 53:15.858
[sobs]

53:26.912 --> 53:28.752
[sobbing]

53:41.677 --> 53:46.137
[Tom] <i> I have heard a lot of indirect stuff</i>
<i>about Edgar and Bill</i>

53:46.223 --> 53:48.103
<i>from numerous sources.</i>

53:49.143 --> 53:52.313
But it's always been
the kind of anecdotal,

53:52.396 --> 53:56.936
to use the term, "scuttlebutt"
that I don't always trust as a reporter.

53:57.776 --> 54:00.236
<i>But I don't necessarily discount them.</i>

54:00.863 --> 54:02.453
<i>If those suspects were involved,</i>

54:02.531 --> 54:06.031
<i>I believe it's undoubtedly</i>
<i>as a flunky gofer.</i>

54:06.118 --> 54:08.868
<i>"Go get us a coffee.</i>
<i>Go take care of this ugly chore."</i>

54:09.413 --> 54:12.213
Very likely,
he was called after the event.

54:12.708 --> 54:15.208
"We got a body we gotta get rid of.
Help us."

54:15.627 --> 54:18.257
"I'll handle that for you, Father.
You're a wonderful guy."

54:18.338 --> 54:19.338
And off we go.

54:19.882 --> 54:23.642
Going into this, we didn't know
of any suspects other than Joseph Maskell.

54:23.886 --> 54:28.596
And we've come up with two:
Edgar Davidson and Billy Schmidt.

54:28.682 --> 54:31.602
<i>Both of them have families</i>
<i>with compelling stories</i>

54:31.685 --> 54:34.895
<i>who are pretty convincing.</i>

54:34.980 --> 54:38.150
<i>So, if both of those stories are true,</i>

54:38.233 --> 54:41.863
<i>then both of these men</i>
<i>were involved with this together.</i>

54:45.491 --> 54:48.621
Well, let me ask you a question.
So, you've spoken to Debra?

54:48.952 --> 54:51.002
-[man] Uh-uh. We call her Debbie.
-Debbie.

54:51.079 --> 54:53.959
Does her story and my story
sound similar to you?

54:54.583 --> 54:57.673
It's two nieces saying,
"My uncle was involved."

54:58.170 --> 55:01.420
You know, I mean, because, honestly,
you don't know me from Adam.

55:01.507 --> 55:04.757
I could be making this up, and it's hard
to keep your stories straight

55:04.843 --> 55:07.723
if you're making something up,
so, I get it, you know.

55:08.013 --> 55:11.773
But my story is always gonna be the same.
It's the same no matter what.

55:12.643 --> 55:14.903
<i>Debra Yohn, when I spoke to her,</i>

55:14.978 --> 55:20.358
<i>she is as convinced that her uncle did it</i>
<i>as I am that my uncle did it.</i>

55:20.692 --> 55:25.782
But the weird thing is,
the story is, like, the same.

55:25.864 --> 55:29.704
She was telling me
that her uncle had a bloody shirt

55:29.785 --> 55:32.075
and claimed that he had a fistfight
with his boss.

55:32.162 --> 55:34.962
And I'm like, "My father told my mother

55:35.040 --> 55:38.130
that he had a fistfight in a bar,
that's why his shirt was bloody."

55:38.210 --> 55:39.340
It's just like, "Hmm."

55:39.419 --> 55:42.799
If you have two people conspiring
and they're making up their story--

55:42.881 --> 55:45.841
I mean, that's where my mind went
when we were talking about it.

55:45.926 --> 55:49.636
Maybe they know each other,
maybe they did it together. I don't know.

55:50.597 --> 55:53.477
[Debbie] <i>I believe my aunt</i>
<i>because I know how Ed is.</i>

55:53.892 --> 55:57.352
<i>You didn't know if he was gonna be</i>
<i>the good guy or the bad guy.</i>

55:57.437 --> 56:01.067
<i>There was no rhyme nor reason</i>
<i>for any of the changes in behavior.</i>

56:01.149 --> 56:03.859
<i>It's just the slightest thing...</i>

56:04.987 --> 56:08.657
could make him change,
almost into another person.

56:09.408 --> 56:12.908
I don't think he did it alone,
but he was part of it.

56:13.453 --> 56:18.713
[Sharon] <i>It does not lessen my belief</i>
<i>that my uncle did it, or took part in it.</i>

56:18.792 --> 56:21.252
I should say that,
'cause it's almost seeming

56:21.336 --> 56:24.376
like maybe there was more
than one person involved now.

56:24.923 --> 56:27.383
I didn't get the feeling that, "Oh, okay.

56:27.467 --> 56:30.717
Well, your uncle must've done it
and my uncle didn't." Not at all.

56:30.804 --> 56:33.184
I think we both feel
just as strongly about it.

56:34.725 --> 56:37.555
[Barbara] <i>I don't know Edgar</i>
<i>and I never heard that name,</i>

56:37.644 --> 56:40.984
and I've seen his picture
and it doesn't look familiar to me.

56:41.064 --> 56:42.734
I've never seen him before.

56:43.609 --> 56:46.779
<i>The not knowing, I think,</i>
<i>is harder than the knowing.</i>

56:47.321 --> 56:49.031
<i>Billy, he knew something.</i>

56:49.323 --> 56:51.333
<i>That secret went to the grave with him.</i>

56:52.868 --> 56:55.578
[Margaret] This stuff in your mind,
it wears you down over the years.

56:55.662 --> 56:59.832
<i>It makes you feel really, really old,</i>
<i>because you're carrying something,</i>

57:00.584 --> 57:02.424
<i>and you're carrying it all the time.</i>

57:03.378 --> 57:06.668
Real people have been hurt,
real people have died.

57:06.965 --> 57:08.175
This is what happened.

57:12.512 --> 57:14.562
[Abbie] <i>If we collect</i>
<i>all this information,</i>

57:14.640 --> 57:15.930
<i>what do we do with it?</i>

57:16.016 --> 57:18.096
<i>How do we link these people together?</i>

57:18.352 --> 57:21.942
<i>How do we link Maskell to our perp</i>

57:22.022 --> 57:25.942
<i>if we think Maskell may have sent him</i>
<i>to murder Cathy that night?</i>

57:26.693 --> 57:30.323
We've had to negotiate,
I think, a very delicate minefield.

57:31.114 --> 57:33.204
<i>Father Maskell's dead in the coffin.</i>

57:34.326 --> 57:37.196
<i>Billy Schmidt, he's dead now, too.</i>

57:38.789 --> 57:42.129
[Gemma] <i>But this whole issue of Edgar,</i>

57:42.209 --> 57:46.959
<i>we really shied away from this</i>
<i>because the guy is living.</i>

57:47.631 --> 57:51.431
If he harmed other people,
he's certainly capable of harming us.

57:51.760 --> 57:53.140
Maybe watching too much TV,

57:53.220 --> 57:55.260
it seems like when you've got
all these clues

57:55.347 --> 57:57.977
and you got, you know, people
intimately related with him

57:58.058 --> 58:00.478
who says, "I think he killed him,"
and they did this and that,

58:00.560 --> 58:02.940
that the police will swoop in
and arrest him,

58:03.021 --> 58:07.651
but I guess there's still
a burden of proof.

58:08.402 --> 58:13.872
Talking to him face-to-face
would be productive in one way or another.

58:14.408 --> 58:18.998
I think you would either see somebody
who is honest and wants to tell the truth

58:19.079 --> 58:22.919
or somebody who will play games,
and that would be obvious, too.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.250
[Abbie] Mm-hm.

58:27.254 --> 58:30.634
[Debbie] <i>The best way to approach him</i>
<i>would be to build up some trust,</i>

58:31.633 --> 58:34.093
and to ask him
if he would talk about what he knew.

58:49.526 --> 58:52.276
<i>And I think, at first,</i>
<i>he would probably toy with you,</i>

58:53.280 --> 58:55.120
<i>but I think he would start talking.</i>

58:56.908 --> 58:58.578
<i>And then he would enjoy talking.</i>

58:59.453 --> 59:03.333
<i>And the more you get to know him,</i>
<i>the more information he'll give you</i>

59:03.582 --> 59:05.542
<i>before he realizes he's hung himself.</i>

59:09.838 --> 59:13.508
<i>Kind of reminds me of a cat that plays</i>
<i>with a mouse before it kills it.</i>

59:14.384 --> 59:20.724
<i>There's a little bit of an element of fun</i>
<i>and teasing and enjoyment...</i>

59:22.142 --> 59:23.352
<i>before he strikes.</i>
