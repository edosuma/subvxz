WEBVTT

00:18.551 --> 00:20.686
Hey, hey, hey.
Scoot down, scoot down.

00:20.688 --> 00:23.155
Nick, what are
you doing?
- What are you doing?

00:23.157 --> 00:24.857
Sorry, just scoot down.
I need to iron this shirt

00:24.859 --> 00:26.692
that I'm wearing for my date
with Tran's granddaughter.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.861
It's either this
or the turtleneck

00:28.863 --> 00:30.062
my mother bought me in 2009.

00:30.064 --> 00:31.530
They're my only clean shirts.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.198
The short-sleeved turtleneck?
Don't do that.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.800
Okay, look, we need
this whole table

00:34.802 --> 00:37.302
for Nadia's baby shower,
all right? So, move along.

00:37.304 --> 00:39.371
Nadia-- isn't that
the Russian chick who broke, uh,

00:39.373 --> 00:40.305
Schmidt's, uh...

00:40.307 --> 00:41.340
SCHMIDT:
Will to live?

00:41.342 --> 00:43.008
After she broke my penis?

00:43.010 --> 00:44.576
(chuckles)

00:44.578 --> 00:46.311
Who saw her and thought,

00:46.313 --> 00:48.914
"That's the woman I want to be
the mother of my children"?

00:48.916 --> 00:52.151
She's not sure.
- Yeah, she calls it
her little "sex party miracle."

00:52.153 --> 00:53.819
Do you have to iron here?

00:53.821 --> 00:55.320
It's the only flat surface!

00:55.322 --> 00:57.056
Besides Winston's desk--
but he's using it

00:57.058 --> 00:59.058
to study for his
police academy test,

00:59.060 --> 01:01.160
and he is "not to be disturbed."

01:08.601 --> 01:10.769
Not enough, not enough.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.771
There's an ironing board
in the bathroom.

01:12.773 --> 01:15.874
I know, but I've been using that
to wedge it between two urinals

01:15.876 --> 01:17.543
to keep Schmidt from peeking.

01:17.545 --> 01:19.111
But fine, I'll use that!

01:19.113 --> 01:21.346
Coach! Coach!

01:21.348 --> 01:24.583
My<i> Charlie Rose</i> episodes,
all 18 of them, are gone.

01:24.585 --> 01:25.784
DVR is chockablock
filled with

01:25.786 --> 01:27.953
American football
matches, which,

01:27.955 --> 01:29.688
by the way, is
a garbage... Oh!

01:31.191 --> 01:32.791
We cool?
- (exhales)

01:32.793 --> 01:35.094
Yeah, we cool.
- Cool.

01:35.096 --> 01:36.361
What the hell just happened?

01:36.363 --> 01:37.696
Fight.
- Yeah. Now it's over.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.264
I barely even
remember it.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.433
I cannot believe you guys
handle things that way.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.136
I'm starting to think
that neither one of you read

01:44.138 --> 01:46.705
the Madeleine Albright biography
I gave you for Christmas.

01:46.707 --> 01:49.041
(chuckles) I'm so glad
we don't fight.

01:49.043 --> 01:51.043
I know.
- Oh, please. Women fight.

01:51.045 --> 01:52.978
Well, we occasionally
get into a little thing.

01:52.980 --> 01:55.114
Yeah, I mean, like we just had
that thing with the purse--

01:55.116 --> 01:57.149
but that was, like,
barely even a thing.
- Yeah.

01:57.151 --> 01:59.618
That was nothing--
I mean, there's no point
in even talking about it.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.253
Oh.
- (gasps) Oh.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.255
Oh.
- No, you should
have that.

02:03.257 --> 02:05.257
No, you should have it.
No, you take it.

02:05.259 --> 02:06.492
No, you take it.
No, you take it.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.494
I want you to take it.
No. Take it.

02:08.496 --> 02:09.928
Look, I want you to have it

02:09.930 --> 02:11.330
'cause it would look good
on you.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.132
No, it's<i> made</i> for you.
You... No.

02:14.501 --> 02:17.169
But then we both decided
that it was better

02:17.171 --> 02:18.904
if neither one
of us bought it.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.739
Yep.
- The neon yellow purse?

02:20.741 --> 02:22.407
With the strap?
Yeah, I've seen that.

02:22.409 --> 02:23.709
It's in your closet.

02:24.744 --> 02:25.777
I wonder how many
rubber duckies

02:25.779 --> 02:27.813
needed to die
to make that thing.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.281
Uh, Schmidt, you don't know
what you're talking about.

02:29.283 --> 02:30.949
I got to run.

02:30.951 --> 02:32.618
Oh...
- What?

02:32.620 --> 02:34.419
Thank you so much for helping
with the baby shower.

02:34.421 --> 02:36.255
You know, you are just the best.
No, you're the best.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.624
Whoa.
- Did I tell you I love
your top, by the way?

02:38.626 --> 02:40.526
No. Oh, I just found this
in the back of my closet.
What's... what's happening?

02:40.528 --> 02:42.027
(whispers):
You said too much.

02:42.029 --> 02:43.629
So, I'll call you later?
Definitely.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.831
Okay. Bye!
- Bye!

02:48.501 --> 02:51.003
(door closes)

02:51.005 --> 02:53.305
Oh, my God!

02:53.307 --> 02:55.807
What just happened?

02:55.809 --> 02:58.343
That's a girl fight.

03:05.618 --> 03:06.885
Schmidt, stay
out of it, man.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.053
Girl fights are
dangerous, okay?

03:08.055 --> 03:09.555
I grew up with
three sisters,

03:09.557 --> 03:11.523
and I wore a cup until
I was 14 years old.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.158
What's wrong?

03:13.160 --> 03:15.661
They planned to wear braids
and bows and didn't tell me

03:15.663 --> 03:17.129
on purpose.

03:17.131 --> 03:19.932
There. Now you match.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.374
Well, congratulations
on having sisters,

03:29.376 --> 03:31.376
but I know women.
You blindfold me,

03:31.378 --> 03:33.679
spin me around
and drop me into a rainstorm,

03:33.681 --> 03:35.180
and I'll still find the G-spot.

03:35.182 --> 03:36.915
Schmidt...
Let us not forget
that I had boobs

03:36.917 --> 03:38.917
for the first 19 years
of my life.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.886
I grew up as a fat,
asexual friend-zoner.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.888
You can't buy
that kind of access.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.690
Schmidt, I'm talking about how
women act towards other women.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.558
You don't want to get
in the middle of that.
- Coach...

03:46.560 --> 03:48.260
Jess has the purse.
I saw it in her closet

03:48.262 --> 03:50.162
when it was rainy
and I was bored

03:50.164 --> 03:51.897
and I was feeling snoopy.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.232
COACH:
No, no, no...
See?

03:53.234 --> 03:54.900
Look-- the purse.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.935
In the immortal words of Tag
Team, "Whoop. There it is."

03:56.937 --> 03:59.838
Fine. I went back
and I bought the purse,

03:59.840 --> 04:01.373
'cause I love it.

04:01.375 --> 04:04.343
(groans)
I love purses.

04:04.345 --> 04:06.345
And that doesn't mean
I'm not a feminist, either.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.347
I'm a damn feminist
who loves purses.

04:08.349 --> 04:11.016
Where else am I supposed
to keep my feminist writings?

04:11.018 --> 04:13.018
In a purse, that's where.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.120
Lena Dunham.

04:15.122 --> 04:17.222
I don't know. I...

04:17.224 --> 04:19.424
Jess, it's a purse.
Who cares? Just apologize.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.760
Cece and I have been friends
for 20 years.

04:21.762 --> 04:25.097
Do you know why? Because
we're passive-aggressive people.

04:25.099 --> 04:26.565
We never confront
anything.

04:26.567 --> 04:29.034
That's the way it works with us.
It always has.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.402
Hi.

04:30.404 --> 04:31.937
Hi.

04:35.742 --> 04:38.076
And that was one of
the worst fights we've ever had.

04:38.078 --> 04:39.778
And if I bring up the purse,

04:39.780 --> 04:41.480
then everything else
comes up with it.

04:41.482 --> 04:42.748
Too many things
have happened.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.816
Women have amazing memories.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.652
Because we used to be
the gatherers,

04:46.654 --> 04:48.053
and so we had to remember

04:48.055 --> 04:50.255
where all the best berries
were hidden.

04:50.257 --> 04:51.657
And Cece and I,

04:51.659 --> 04:55.961
we've hidden berries
all across the Great Plains.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.462
Colorado, Kansas,

04:57.464 --> 04:58.730
Montana,

04:58.732 --> 05:01.066
Nebraska-- need I say more?

05:01.068 --> 05:02.267
Coach gets it.

05:02.269 --> 05:03.802
See, Cece and I,
we're gonna be fine,

05:03.804 --> 05:05.771
'cause it's gonna play out
the way it always does.

05:05.773 --> 05:06.838
We're not gonna talk
for three days,

05:06.840 --> 05:08.006
and then
I'll surprise her

05:08.008 --> 05:09.641
with a latte.
And then we'll act

05:09.643 --> 05:11.243
like nothing happened.
Three days without Cece?

05:11.245 --> 05:12.744
Do I have to spend
three days without Cece?

05:12.746 --> 05:14.680
Yes. I don't trust you
around her.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.682
She makes you weak
and penis-dumb.

05:16.684 --> 05:18.583
Three days without Cece?
Why don't you just

05:18.585 --> 05:21.620
replace my shoes with bags
and turn me into a lunatic?

05:21.622 --> 05:23.822
Stay out of it, man.
Stay the hell out of it, bro.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.857
Here's a different take:
Why don't I spend
<i>more</i> time with her?

05:25.859 --> 05:27.659
Stay out of it.
- I'm confused.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.594
Now, should I...
Are you asking me

05:29.596 --> 05:33.465
to spend more time with
her or stay out of it?

05:33.467 --> 05:35.667
Like, for real?

05:41.674 --> 05:43.141
(groans)

05:43.143 --> 05:45.510
I hate this.
I hate first dates.

05:45.512 --> 05:46.812
Me, too.
- I hate all...

05:46.814 --> 05:48.113
I hate the second ones
and the third ones

05:48.115 --> 05:49.047
and the fourth ones.
Me, too. Yeah. Yeah.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.716
I hate dates.
- Mm-hmm.

05:50.718 --> 05:51.950
Yeah.
The first ones are the worst.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.552
Yeah.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.220
This is terrible.
They're terrible.
They're awkward.

05:55.222 --> 05:57.055
I feel like I'm being weird.
You're not being weird.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.290
Yeah, I am.
- I'm the weirdo.

05:58.292 --> 06:00.625
I wanted to do
this all night.

06:00.627 --> 06:01.827
Oh.

06:01.829 --> 06:04.363
That is so stupid.
(laughs)

06:04.365 --> 06:06.365
I hated that I did it.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.066
I feel like
I'm being weird, too.

06:08.068 --> 06:10.168
How?
I don't know how. Just...

06:10.170 --> 06:11.503
Well, now you are.

06:11.505 --> 06:13.238
These sweaters.
I got sweater shoulder.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.906
Now... when you do that,
it's very weird.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.174
But before, it wasn't.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.709
Just don't do
sweater shoulder.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.045
Please don't tell Tran
how bad this is going.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.313
Oh, I will.

06:21.315 --> 06:22.748
Don't. It'll be so embarrassing.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.816
Yeah.
He's probably my best friend.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.518
Really?
Yes.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.153
You're not his best friend.

06:28.155 --> 06:29.654
(laughing)

06:29.656 --> 06:32.391
That's a terrible thing to say.
(laughing)

06:32.393 --> 06:33.925
It's true.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.728
This is going great.
Oh, God, I hate this.

06:36.730 --> 06:40.365
I just want to sit around and
do nothing, but that is not hot.

06:40.367 --> 06:41.500
That's hot to me.

06:41.502 --> 06:42.834
You add some
sweatpants

06:42.836 --> 06:44.336
to that, and that is
better than porn.

06:44.338 --> 06:46.338
(chuckles)
I love porn.

06:46.340 --> 06:50.509
But I like to mute it
and come up with
my own voices, like,

06:50.511 --> 06:52.878
(deeply): "Hey, that's a very
interesting mesh cat suit."

06:52.880 --> 06:55.514
(high-pitched): "Thank you.
It used to be my grandmother's."

06:55.516 --> 06:57.449
(laughs)
- Something like that.

06:57.451 --> 06:58.950
Cheers.

06:58.952 --> 07:00.152
Yeah.

07:00.953 --> 07:02.521
That was a weird cheers!

07:02.523 --> 07:04.022
Can we go?!

07:04.024 --> 07:07.125
(laughs): Yes. Let's get
out of here. This sucks!

07:08.127 --> 07:10.395
(laughing,
speaking unintelligibly)

07:10.397 --> 07:11.797
So cute.

07:11.799 --> 07:14.099
Yeah, it's like they're
made for each other.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.772
They haven't moved
in three days.
- Very weird.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.441
Alarming, even.

07:22.443 --> 07:24.776
Wait, doesn't
she work or...?

07:24.778 --> 07:26.244
Shouldn't you be studying?

07:26.246 --> 07:27.412
Or live somewhere?

07:27.414 --> 07:28.747
Shouldn't you be studying?

07:28.749 --> 07:31.249
Or have worried
loved ones?
- Studying?

07:31.251 --> 07:32.918
Coach, this is gonna
take some serious

07:32.920 --> 07:34.886
investigative
police skills.

07:34.888 --> 07:37.222
But I'm onto her.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.157
I didn't know girls
could be so slovenly.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.425
I did. I have sisters.

07:40.427 --> 07:41.493
Oh, my God, we know.

07:41.495 --> 07:42.561
(grunts)

07:42.563 --> 07:45.831
We cool?
We cool.

07:48.267 --> 07:50.502
Oh. Just who
I was looking for.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.838
Hey.
- How would you like
a piping hot latte?

07:52.840 --> 07:54.906
Thanks, Jess,
but, you know, I, um...

07:54.908 --> 07:57.142
I can buy my own.

08:06.519 --> 08:08.220
What did you do?

08:10.356 --> 08:12.524
Is this about the socks?

08:15.795 --> 08:17.262
You weren't supposed to talk
to Cece. What happened?

08:17.264 --> 08:18.630
Well, I had to see her.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.499
I can't go three days
without seeing Cece.

08:20.501 --> 08:23.001
(exhales) And it went
just like you said it would.

08:24.203 --> 08:25.704
I'm gonna go get the purse.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.138
She played me
like John Popper plays that

08:27.140 --> 08:28.507
little harmonica
and fiddle thing.

08:28.509 --> 08:30.208
Ugh! She's like
a robot scientist.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.377
And you're like a damn robot.

08:32.379 --> 08:35.113
And usually it's cute,
except when you're robbing me.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.682
Jess, I'm sorry. So...
What-What happens now?

08:37.684 --> 08:39.784
You bring her another coffee
and you guys make up?

08:39.786 --> 08:41.520
I don't know what happens now.

08:41.522 --> 08:44.155
We're in unchartered territory
'cause you got involved.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.390
We're entering the abyss.

08:45.392 --> 08:46.725
It's like the month I decided

08:46.727 --> 08:49.327
not to wear a bra.
Those were dark times.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.897
I had no support.
Literally no support.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.532
(phone chimes)

08:55.034 --> 08:56.501
(scoffs)

08:56.503 --> 08:59.404
Cece just texted me
a smiley face.
- Is that bad?

08:59.406 --> 09:02.474
No, she just texted me the
world's first good smiley face.

09:02.476 --> 09:05.210
I'm gonna text her
(chuckles) a yellow heart.

09:05.212 --> 09:08.580
No, uh, yellow heart, whale,

09:08.582 --> 09:10.549
thumbs up.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.384
Well, that seems nice.
(gasps)

09:12.386 --> 09:15.887
How dare she? Chinese man,
ballerina, apartment building?

09:15.889 --> 09:16.922
What does that mean?
- Fine!

09:16.924 --> 09:18.823
Poop. Turban guy. Granny.

09:18.825 --> 09:20.592
Don't text her poop.
- (gasps)

09:20.594 --> 09:23.528
Explosion, monkey-see?
You want to play dirty? Fine.

09:23.530 --> 09:25.063
Slice of cake. Turtle.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.231
Don't sen... Oh.
- (gasps)

09:26.233 --> 09:28.466
Double syringe?

09:32.838 --> 09:34.372
Double syringe.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.607
You're right, Schmidt.

09:35.609 --> 09:38.577
Maybe it's time
to dig up some berries.

09:38.579 --> 09:42.013
The gatherers
have become the hunters.

09:42.015 --> 09:44.082
Be well.

09:45.117 --> 09:46.918
Wh-Where are you...
Where are going?

09:46.920 --> 09:49.020
L-Leave those berries be.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.855
Republican or Democrat?
<i>West Wing.</i>

09:50.857 --> 09:52.290
What's your favorite thing
about America?

09:52.292 --> 09:54.459
Kentucky women.
Favorite part of<i> The Rock?</i>

09:54.461 --> 09:56.895
"Welcome to the Rock."
Gorilla or monkey?

09:56.897 --> 09:59.197
Gorilla, hands down.
Miranda or Carrie?

09:59.199 --> 10:01.099
Gorilla.
- That's 100% perfect.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.534
Un-Unbelievable.
- Thank you.

10:02.536 --> 10:04.402
The battery in the
remote control is

10:04.404 --> 10:06.471
getting a little jumpy.
I'm gonna go grab one

10:06.473 --> 10:07.706
out of the smoke detector.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.708
That's exactly
where I get them.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.077
Isn't she perfect?

10:12.079 --> 10:13.979
In a word: No.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.947
Nick, you might want
to sit down for this.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.315
I'm already sitting.
- Okay.

10:17.317 --> 10:20.051
Well, look, I put
together a profile.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.152
Vague about where she lives.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.054
Okay.
- No mention of a job.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.723
Always lets you pay.

10:24.725 --> 10:27.158
Nick, my man, as unbelievable
as this sounds, (chuckles)

10:27.160 --> 10:28.994
you're her sugar daddy.

10:28.996 --> 10:32.230
What kind of girl would
want me as her sugar daddy?

10:32.232 --> 10:35.233
Only one kind:
a homeless woman.

10:35.235 --> 10:36.968
Kai is not homeless.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.904
Nick, I have been watching
her for days now, okay?

10:39.906 --> 10:41.673
She... She eats like
she doesn't know

10:41.675 --> 10:43.274
where her next meal
is coming from.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.744
She always dresses in
layers, tons of layers.

10:45.746 --> 10:48.346
She's not homeless.
Her grandfather is Tran.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.448
And where does he hang out?
A park bench.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.517
I think you're having
a nervous breakdown.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.452
I really do.

10:54.454 --> 10:57.022
You're nuts. You want
to avoid studying so much

10:57.024 --> 11:00.458
that you're making up lies
about my new lover friend.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.160
Just leave us alone.

11:03.796 --> 11:05.597
Maybe you should...
maybe you should give her

11:05.599 --> 11:07.932
our can opener.
Everybody gives bums cans,

11:07.934 --> 11:09.634
but they can't open them cans.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.302
How are they gonna
open the cans, Nick?

11:11.304 --> 11:12.637
Hey...

11:12.639 --> 11:15.006
What are you...
(stammers)

11:15.008 --> 11:16.675
Do you want a blanket?

11:16.677 --> 11:20.278
I must have
fallen asleep reading.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.681
Nap with me.
- Okay.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.449
Come on.
- (chuckles)

11:28.521 --> 11:31.523
Just... gonna get some
of these newspapers.

11:42.168 --> 11:43.902
It's actually kind of nice.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.870
See?

11:45.872 --> 11:48.573
More pink lemonade?

11:48.575 --> 11:50.909
I'm going to
name baby...

11:50.911 --> 11:54.512
Baby, because it's
funny. (giggles)

11:54.514 --> 11:57.282
(chuckles)

11:58.350 --> 12:01.119
Where is top of baby cage?

12:02.488 --> 12:04.389
Double syringe?

12:04.391 --> 12:07.025
Hey, you.
How's pee-pee? (giggles)

12:07.027 --> 12:08.193
Oh, hello, Nadia.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.228
Coach, I need you.
Jess and Cece

12:10.230 --> 12:12.097
are in a thing,
and it is terrifying.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.666
I'm pretty busy, but,
all right, hold on, let me

12:14.668 --> 12:16.668
put down the stuff
I've been working on.

12:16.670 --> 12:18.169
(grunting softly)

12:18.171 --> 12:19.704
Coach,

12:19.706 --> 12:21.573
I am at the baby shower.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.041
You're at the... What?

12:23.043 --> 12:24.375
Are you dumb? You're dumb.

12:24.377 --> 12:26.177
You're very dumb.
Get out of there.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.879
I panicked. I didn't know
what else to do.

12:27.881 --> 12:30.048
I thought I could fix this.
I gave Cece the purse.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.282
Obviously, it was a mistake.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.584
Oh, God, look at them.

12:32.586 --> 12:33.952
They're like silent, angry

12:33.954 --> 12:36.421
statues right now--
it's terrifying and als...

12:36.423 --> 12:38.089
Maybe a little erotic.

12:38.958 --> 12:40.391
Okay, fine, it's very erotic.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.026
You know what?
Coach, I'm telling you--

12:42.028 --> 12:43.695
I'm finding out that fear

12:43.697 --> 12:45.930
plays a big part
in my sexuality.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.732
Schmidt, what happens when
two passive-aggressive people

12:47.734 --> 12:49.134
start confronting each other?

12:49.136 --> 12:51.069
I don't know. What happens?
Anything!

12:51.071 --> 12:53.204
Anything can happen!
That's what I'm telling you!

12:53.206 --> 12:54.906
Are you ready
for anything to happen?

12:54.908 --> 12:56.741
Obviously not.
That's why I'm calling you.

12:56.743 --> 12:59.911
Did you wash your hair?
It looks really clean.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.946
(women gasp)
(Jess gasps)

13:02.648 --> 13:03.982
I can help you end this.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.283
Do you know why?

13:05.285 --> 13:07.786
Do you know why?
I'm waiting.

13:07.788 --> 13:10.121
Oh, my God, is it because
you have sisters?

13:10.123 --> 13:12.590
It's because I have<i> sisters!</i>
And you know what that means?

13:12.592 --> 13:14.092
And that you know more
about women than me.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.660
I know more about
women than you!

13:15.662 --> 13:16.628
And that I'm a little dumb-dumb.

13:16.630 --> 13:18.463
And I'm a big smart-smart.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.799
Yeah. Now, here's
what you're gonna do.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.167
Get big like a bear.

13:22.169 --> 13:23.968
If that doesn't work,
pee a circle

13:23.970 --> 13:25.904
around yourself
and light it on fire.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.772
I peed before I came--
I had a root beer with lunch.

13:27.774 --> 13:30.008
I'm on my way.
Hey, uh, did you bring a gift?

13:30.010 --> 13:31.643
'Cause I don't
want to be that guy.

13:31.645 --> 13:33.244
You know, the guy
that doesn't bring a gift?

13:33.246 --> 13:34.979
Just get over here.
All right, I'm coming.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.615
What? Coach!

13:37.617 --> 13:39.617
Coach, I can't turn the pages!

13:39.619 --> 13:42.153
How am I gonna study
if I can't turn the pages?

13:42.155 --> 13:43.922
Coach!

13:47.193 --> 13:48.960
Hey.

13:48.962 --> 13:51.029
(gagging)
- Great catch.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.997
Kai, I want to go
to your place, okay?

13:52.999 --> 13:54.465
Wherever it is.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.768
So don't be afraid,
because I'm not afraid.

13:56.770 --> 13:59.037
I know I'm living
this rock star life,

13:59.039 --> 14:01.940
but I'm still a man
of the people.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.475
But I'm so comfortable.
You really want to go outside,

14:04.477 --> 14:07.278
get off this bed into
the cold right now?

14:07.280 --> 14:09.180
Look, I like you for you, and...

14:09.182 --> 14:10.949
Well, hell, I just hope,
deep down,

14:10.951 --> 14:12.383
you like me for me and not

14:12.385 --> 14:14.752
all the incredible stuff
that I have.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.455
Huh?
- I mean, this room--

14:17.457 --> 14:18.990
half this stuff is mine.

14:18.992 --> 14:21.226
I'm, like,
I have enough pillowcases

14:21.228 --> 14:24.229
for all my pillows,
plus an extra pillowcase

14:24.231 --> 14:25.864
that I don't even use.

14:25.866 --> 14:28.132
Ticket stubs
to all the Bears games

14:28.134 --> 14:29.734
I've ever been to,
except for one.

14:29.736 --> 14:31.469
The guitar pick from

14:31.471 --> 14:34.172
that guy who played with
James Taylor that one night.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.140
A Frisbee
that I'm currently

14:36.142 --> 14:38.142
storing on my neighbor's roof.

14:38.144 --> 14:39.644
You know, an autographed

14:39.646 --> 14:42.547
<i>Karate Kid II</i> poster
from Mr. Miyagi.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.649
R.I.P.
- Hmm.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.484
But none of that matters.

14:46.486 --> 14:49.153
I want to be with you,
wherever you live.

14:49.155 --> 14:50.922
I mean, hell,
I've been cooped up

14:50.924 --> 14:52.357
in this palace for long enough.

14:52.359 --> 14:55.760
Wow. Well, if it's
that important.

14:55.762 --> 14:58.096
(grunts)
- (laughs)

14:58.098 --> 15:00.632
All right. Don't be nervous.

15:02.201 --> 15:05.003
You know what? I'm gonna bring
some extra blankets.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.571
Okay.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.673
Okay, just in case it's
freezing, 'cause it's outs...

15:08.675 --> 15:10.275
Okay.

15:10.277 --> 15:11.776
JESS:
And then,

15:11.778 --> 15:14.445
you told Mike Hannamin
I was on my period!

15:14.447 --> 15:17.415
He wanted to know why you were
wearing sweatpants in the pool!

15:17.417 --> 15:19.684
Okay, I was defending you!

15:19.686 --> 15:21.386
I have arrived!

15:21.388 --> 15:22.720
Ah, Mr. Stripper.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.088
Okay, so what's next, Jess?

15:24.090 --> 15:25.556
20 years of fights are
happening right now.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.225
They're getting
into everything.

15:27.227 --> 15:29.294
How I intentionally didn't
put gas in your car

15:29.296 --> 15:31.062
on senior ditch day?
You did. You did.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.864
I did not!
- All right, ladies,
stop it.

15:32.866 --> 15:35.800
I gave you the money, and you
spent it on condoms and taffy.

15:35.802 --> 15:37.769
By the way, that sounds
like a hell of a day.

15:37.771 --> 15:39.070
Well, I wouldn't know.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.872
I was stranded on
a beach being a virgin!

15:40.874 --> 15:43.875
But that's not the only time
I've been stranded, now, is it?

15:43.877 --> 15:45.076
I'm talking about Paris.
Oh, this is about Paris!

15:45.078 --> 15:46.778
I'm talking about Paris.
I knew it!

15:46.780 --> 15:49.814
We had signed a lease.
That's an agreement.

15:49.816 --> 15:52.483
And then you decide
to take a modeling job in Paris,

15:52.485 --> 15:54.652
so I had to move in
with Spencer?

15:54.654 --> 15:57.155
While you were being
squired about the Louvre,

15:57.157 --> 16:02.093
I was having to pee on top of
Spencer's pee to conserve water!

16:02.095 --> 16:03.594
You know, it's called
mud-sharking, by the way.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.430
It's not my fault!
- Stop it!

16:05.432 --> 16:07.098
I'm bored.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.333
Here's what you guys
are gonna do.

16:08.335 --> 16:09.434
You're gonna punch each other.

16:09.436 --> 16:10.768
Now I'm not bored.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.470
I'm not doing that.
- What?

16:12.472 --> 16:14.439
I'm not doing that.
COACH: Well, you got
to do something.

16:14.441 --> 16:16.908
Man up, punch each other
and end this.

16:16.910 --> 16:18.309
(sighs, sniffles)
COACH: You got to have it out

16:18.311 --> 16:19.510
so you can get
past this.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.145
Now I'm bored again.

16:21.147 --> 16:23.281
Punch each other!
Now I'm not bored.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.349
Talk with your fist!

16:24.351 --> 16:27.251
(sighs)
I just want my...

16:27.253 --> 16:28.953
(women screaming, shouting)

16:28.955 --> 16:30.021
Oh, no!
- My goodness!

16:30.023 --> 16:31.456
Back off!

16:31.458 --> 16:33.758
(grunting)

16:33.760 --> 16:34.993
La-Ladies?
- Oh!

16:34.995 --> 16:36.928
SCHMIDT:
It's spreading.

16:36.930 --> 16:37.762
Stop it!

16:37.764 --> 16:39.197
Russian baby shower!

16:39.199 --> 16:41.366
(women clamoring)

16:41.368 --> 16:43.167
(both shouting)

16:43.169 --> 16:45.169
Hey, hey, don't
involve us, please.
Whoa. Hey, guys, no!

16:45.171 --> 16:47.872
Break it up!
Break it up!

16:47.874 --> 16:50.641
Baby shower! Baby shower, yeah!
Baby shower!

16:50.643 --> 16:52.343
Oh, stop it!

16:52.345 --> 16:54.612
You stole my babysitter!

16:56.815 --> 16:58.683
What are you doing?

16:58.685 --> 16:59.884
I'm having a situation.

16:59.886 --> 17:01.786
Oh, come on, dude.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.288
Get off!
Fighting for no damn
reason with me?!

17:04.290 --> 17:07.825
Come on, just... lie down
and take it like a woman!

17:07.827 --> 17:10.161
This is for
Mike Hannamin.
(groans)

17:10.163 --> 17:12.663
(laughing)
- (screaming)

17:12.665 --> 17:14.966
Baby kick! Baby like!

17:14.968 --> 17:16.367
Yay!

17:26.545 --> 17:28.379
Do I look pretty?

17:28.381 --> 17:31.816
(both laughing)

17:31.818 --> 17:33.418
Do you feel, like,
really good right now?

17:33.420 --> 17:35.486
Yes! I thought I was crazy.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.255
No, you're not crazy.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.257
I think I... I think I wanted

17:39.259 --> 17:41.325
to punch you
for a really long time.

17:41.327 --> 17:42.493
Felt that way.

17:42.495 --> 17:45.363
Like, maybe ten or 15 years.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.098
And it feels so good

17:47.100 --> 17:49.767
that right now we don't have
to talk everything through.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.269
Yeah. We can just punch it out.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.503
Oh, my God, I have missed you.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.906
(both laughing)

17:54.908 --> 17:56.741
I can't believe
I've known you 20 years.

17:56.743 --> 18:00.478
And you're still
my favorite person to talk to.

18:02.414 --> 18:04.949
And you're my favorite person
to talk to.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.185
I hate not talking to you.

18:07.187 --> 18:08.886
I feel like
I've missed everything!

18:08.888 --> 18:10.288
You did miss everything.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.422
So, does Nick have a girlfriend?

18:11.424 --> 18:13.357
Yes. So weird.
- You okay?

18:13.359 --> 18:15.259
Yes. It's so weird.
- (laughing)

18:15.261 --> 18:18.196
So, is Nadia going to raise
the baby in your apartment?

18:18.198 --> 18:20.465
Yeah, we haven't really
talked about that yet.

18:21.266 --> 18:22.767
You should.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.036
(laughing)

18:25.038 --> 18:26.571
Craig Hodges.

18:26.573 --> 18:27.605
Oh!

18:27.607 --> 18:30.608
(phone ringing)

18:30.610 --> 18:32.777
Hello. Nick.
Nick, are you okay?

18:32.779 --> 18:34.479
NICK: Winston?
Listen, listen, listen, Nick.

18:34.481 --> 18:35.813
Winston.
Tell me everything.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.582
Winston, she's rich!

18:37.584 --> 18:38.749
Yeah, she founded some company

18:38.751 --> 18:41.152
that sells fancy water bottles

18:41.154 --> 18:44.222
to rich people to pay
for digging wells in Africa.

18:44.224 --> 18:45.756
She sold the company, so now

18:45.758 --> 18:47.592
she works whenever she wants.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.293
It's a scam called consulting.

18:49.295 --> 18:50.761
You see, I knew it.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.497
I knew there was
something weird. I was right!

18:52.499 --> 18:55.433
You were wrong
about literally everything.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.335
But I knew there was gonna be
a twist, though.

18:57.337 --> 18:59.303
Okay, do you realize
how much time you've wasted,

18:59.305 --> 19:00.571
and you're not studying?

19:00.573 --> 19:04.175
Sweet Baby LeBron James,
I screwed up.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.414
(groans)

19:10.416 --> 19:12.250
Hey, I should
probably get going.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.818
I got to get to work.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.186
Yeah, it's karaoke night,

19:15.188 --> 19:16.687
so I got to get
there early enough

19:16.689 --> 19:18.322
to break the
karaoke machine.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.658
How much will you make tonight?

19:20.660 --> 19:23.528
Ah, it depends how much I drink,
but probably about 140 bucks.

19:29.034 --> 19:30.668
What is this?

19:30.670 --> 19:34.505
I raise you to $200.

19:35.941 --> 19:38.442
Now you can stay.

19:38.444 --> 19:40.845
Deal!

19:40.847 --> 19:42.013
Oh.
- (laughs)

19:42.015 --> 19:43.381
I'm like a boy hooker.

19:43.383 --> 19:44.649
(both laugh)

19:44.651 --> 19:46.117
Thank you.

19:46.119 --> 19:47.618
Are you crying?

19:48.654 --> 19:50.955
Don't look at me.

19:50.957 --> 19:52.823
I want to look pretty.
You paid for it.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.292
(both laugh)

19:54.294 --> 19:56.194
Nadia is the one
who broke my thing.

19:56.196 --> 19:57.562
Wait, you were serious
about that?

19:57.564 --> 19:59.130
Yes. That was her.
I'm telling you.

19:59.132 --> 20:01.132
She's going to have to
childproof the corners

20:01.134 --> 20:03.334
of her cha-cha before
that baby comes out.

20:03.336 --> 20:04.735
Oh, Cecilia.

20:04.737 --> 20:07.405
Thank goodness. Look at you.
You're still pretty.

20:07.407 --> 20:08.406
And, Jess, you know,

20:08.408 --> 20:09.707
you-you look the same.

20:09.709 --> 20:10.908
COACH: I'm sorry
about making you guys

20:10.910 --> 20:12.877
punch each other.
- Don't be sorry.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.512
You're so right.
- Mm.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.047
We've wasted so much time
being passive-aggressive.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.882
We learned our lesson.
- Yeah.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.218
Well, we're very smart.
That means a lot. Thank you.

20:20.220 --> 20:21.886
Seriously, if you guys
fought like girls,

20:21.888 --> 20:23.821
you'd still be
arguing over the fact

20:23.823 --> 20:25.923
that you recorded football over
your<i> Charlie Rose</i> episodes.

20:25.925 --> 20:28.226
It's all good, man.
We're not though.

20:28.228 --> 20:30.027
Mm-hmm, and the girl Schmidt
would be like,

20:30.029 --> 20:32.163
"Oh, does Coach just think
I'm a pretentious poseur

20:32.165 --> 20:34.031
"who just records
things to look smart

20:34.033 --> 20:36.901
"because deep down,
I am just terrifyingly insecure

20:36.903 --> 20:38.569
about my intelligence?"

20:38.571 --> 20:40.504
JESS: Yeah, and girl Coach
would be, like,

20:40.506 --> 20:42.440
"Does Schmidt think that
I'm an uncultured meathead

20:42.442 --> 20:44.108
"who has to rewatch football

20:44.110 --> 20:46.677
because I'm afraid of showing
anyone my softer side?"

20:46.679 --> 20:47.778
(clears throat quietly)

20:47.780 --> 20:51.282
(Cece and Jess laugh)

20:53.585 --> 20:54.919
Hey, man.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.387
Oh, hey, Coach.
- Aw, hey, you.

20:56.389 --> 20:57.755
That's nice.
- Oh, this?

20:57.757 --> 20:59.390
I-I don't know.
Thanks, I guess.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.459
I'm kind of
whatever about it.
- No.

21:01.461 --> 21:02.760
What do you got there?

21:02.762 --> 21:04.295
Oh, me? Uh, just
some sneakers.

21:04.297 --> 21:05.696
(laughs)
I hope they're okay.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.465
I don't have an eye
for things like you.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.967
Well, yeah, you do. Come on,
don't be so hard on yourself.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.769
Your eye is so good.
- I'm sure
they're great.

21:11.771 --> 21:14.071
I...
- Not that you could
look bad in anything really.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.139
(laughs)

21:15.141 --> 21:17.208
(groans)
- (groans)
Son of a...

21:17.210 --> 21:18.576
(groans)
Thank you for that.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.444
Yeah,
thanks, man.
- Anytime.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.546
We cool?
- Yeah, we cool.

21:22.548 --> 21:24.282
(whistles)

21:24.284 --> 21:26.284
Ooh, boy.

21:26.286 --> 21:28.619
How many pages
are in this thing?

21:28.621 --> 21:30.888
Darius Miles. Oh!

21:30.890 --> 21:32.923
Hmm.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.558
That's in there?

21:34.560 --> 21:36.460
Jordan.

21:36.462 --> 21:39.897
Massaging is illegal?
(groans)

21:39.899 --> 21:41.999
What?!

21:42.834 --> 21:45.002
Got to download a song.
