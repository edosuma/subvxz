WEBVTT

00:28.269 --> 00:31.673
Well, let's see, he was in
charge of me,

00:33.442 --> 00:34.476
my life, me.

00:35.243 --> 00:37.546
But he comes up every once in a
while

00:37.579 --> 00:40.047
just in my mind.

00:41.282 --> 00:44.018
The name is very clear.

00:46.320 --> 00:48.322
Sator, it was Sator, who

00:51.693 --> 00:54.028
was in charge of everything.

06:39.775 --> 06:43.912
All upon
the face of the forest,

06:43.945 --> 06:46.548
shall tremble at his presence.

06:47.682 --> 06:51.052
And the mountains shall be
thrown down.

06:51.787 --> 06:54.956
For Sator's eyes are in every
place

06:57.859 --> 07:00.327
on those who fear him,

07:00.361 --> 07:03.297
On those who hope for his
kindness.

07:04.566 --> 07:05.734
his acceptance.

07:07.402 --> 07:09.938
Every beast of the forest,

07:09.971 --> 07:12.507
everything that moves is his.

07:14.910 --> 07:17.712
Sator has made a covenant of
peace,

07:18.380 --> 07:23.585
illuminating all harmful
beasts from this land.

07:24.386 --> 07:26.888
And uses their flesh

07:26.922 --> 07:29.323
to cloak his disciples,

07:30.058 --> 07:35.063
so that we may all live
securely in the wilderness

07:36.064 --> 07:39.401
and sleep soundly in the woods.

07:39.434 --> 07:42.070
We find you stranded

07:42.904 --> 07:47.876
in a howling waste of a
wilderness.

07:47.909 --> 07:50.545
We observe you.

07:50.579 --> 07:53.481
We learn all about your ways.

07:54.549 --> 07:57.018
And when the sun rises,

07:57.052 --> 08:02.057
we withdraw and lie down in our
dens.

11:05.673 --> 11:10.678
Hmm.

11:29.931 --> 11:30.799
Hmm.

12:10.004 --> 12:10.872
What?

12:14.443 --> 12:15.310
Hmm.

12:33.261 --> 12:35.897
Get out of my head.

13:35.790 --> 13:37.225
I bet the card's messed up.

13:41.430 --> 13:42.363
Who's cam is this?

13:43.898 --> 13:45.366
Grandpa Jim's?

13:45.401 --> 13:46.267
Yeah.

13:47.869 --> 13:48.736
Hmm.

14:06.988 --> 14:07.889
You hunting deer?

14:18.866 --> 14:19.734
Mm.

14:30.044 --> 14:31.480
You know grandpa kept a lot of
gear

14:31.513 --> 14:32.880
at the main house, right?

14:34.450 --> 14:36.217
Probably had another one of
these.

14:38.253 --> 14:39.187
Some beer too.

14:42.156 --> 14:43.024
Wanna stop by?

14:50.298 --> 14:53.067
I would have put a shotgun
in my mouth by now,

14:53.101 --> 14:54.769
if this is where I thought I'd
end up.

14:58.072 --> 14:58.973
Fuckin' Deborah.

15:00.676 --> 15:03.011
She could have fought a little
harder

15:03.044 --> 15:05.514
for you to be where I'm at.

15:15.857 --> 15:17.593
I'm telling ya, man,

15:17.626 --> 15:19.894
if you would have just talked
about Sator,

15:22.464 --> 15:25.300
I guarantee the home
would have accepted your ass.

16:08.976 --> 16:10.345
all kind of places.

16:12.614 --> 16:16.084
Well I'm not anyone who
gets up to anything anymore.

16:16.117 --> 16:17.486
Not up to anything?

16:17.519 --> 16:21.089
No, I sit in this spot here.

16:22.056 --> 16:23.525
But my brain's dead.

16:23.559 --> 16:25.293
- Mine too.
- Oh.

16:25.326 --> 16:27.362
Welcome to the crowd.

16:28.664 --> 16:30.632
- Yeah.
- No, I don't know, I,

16:30.666 --> 16:33.968
memory is something I lose.

16:34.737 --> 16:36.204
I pick up something in the
house,

16:36.237 --> 16:38.206
take it around and put it down,

16:38.239 --> 16:40.174
and then I can't find it again.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.143
- I forgot where I put it.
- Yeah.

16:42.176 --> 16:45.113
Ha, I wasn't lucky when Jim
died,

16:45.146 --> 16:46.147
but when he did,

16:47.148 --> 16:49.385
they still let me stay on here.

16:49.418 --> 16:51.085
I've just been here ever since
then.

16:51.119 --> 16:54.122
I don't know how many
years since Jim died.

16:54.155 --> 16:55.890
I miss him every day.

17:37.231 --> 17:39.233
So distracted down here.

17:42.069 --> 17:44.038
Forget to look up sometimes.

18:14.803 --> 18:15.671
I'm Evie.

18:20.241 --> 18:21.643
Can I help you look for
anything?

19:36.117 --> 19:38.787
Don't drink all of
these.

20:35.777 --> 20:38.580
When you
summon Sator,

20:38.614 --> 20:42.818
he will turn his attention to
you.

20:42.851 --> 20:45.152
Submit yourself

20:45.186 --> 20:49.925
to him, trust in him completely.

20:49.958 --> 20:55.162
And do not lean on your own
understanding.

20:56.064 --> 20:59.534
You will be tested by affliction

20:59.568 --> 21:01.436
for he is

21:02.437 --> 21:04.673
a consuming fire.

21:04.706 --> 21:09.711
And after you have
suffered a little while,

21:10.112 --> 21:12.514
he will refine you.

21:12.547 --> 21:14.348
He will

21:14.383 --> 21:15.517
make you pure.

26:53.288 --> 26:55.590
- Hi, Nani.
- Oh,

26:55.623 --> 26:56.925
hi there.

26:56.958 --> 26:57.993
How are you?

26:58.026 --> 27:00.595
How come you my name and
I don't know who you are?

27:00.628 --> 27:01.863
Oh, hello.

27:01.896 --> 27:02.697
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:02.731 --> 27:04.933
Good to see you.

27:04.966 --> 27:07.669
Fred, Jack, Joe?

27:07.702 --> 27:09.170
You know, you know me.

27:09.204 --> 27:09.971
- No, I don't.
- You know.

27:10.005 --> 27:12.140
I don't recognize you. Why is
that?

27:12.173 --> 27:13.775
I don't know.

27:13.808 --> 27:16.011
- It'll come to you.
- Oh, I don't know why.

27:16.044 --> 27:18.279
I just don't recognize
you for some reason.

27:18.313 --> 27:19.948
I'm your grandson.

27:19.981 --> 27:22.717
Well I thought so, but
you got a beard, you've grown

27:23.918 --> 27:25.687
considerably since I last saw
you.

27:25.720 --> 27:27.288
I was just here yesterday.

27:29.657 --> 27:30.792
- Yesterday?
- Mm-hmm.

27:31.793 --> 27:32.660
Yeah.

27:33.762 --> 27:35.630
We had a good talk yesterday.

27:35.663 --> 27:37.899
- Who did?
- Me and you.

27:37.932 --> 27:40.135
How you've been sensing spirits.

27:40.168 --> 27:42.203
I don't remember
yesterday.

27:42.237 --> 27:43.972
Oh, that's okay.

27:44.005 --> 27:46.174
What kind of things did...

27:46.207 --> 27:48.676
What kind of things happen
around here

27:48.710 --> 27:50.011
that are peculiar?

27:50.045 --> 27:51.646
You sure that was yesterday?

27:51.679 --> 27:53.181
I'm pretty
sure that was yesterday.

27:53.214 --> 27:55.116
Well occasionally,
something happens.

27:55.150 --> 27:56.084
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

27:56.117 --> 27:58.920
Things are,
they'll be moved somewhere

27:58.953 --> 28:00.855
- from one place to another.
- Yeah.

28:13.168 --> 28:13.902
You put something somewhere-

28:13.935 --> 28:15.603
Yeah, and you know darn
well

28:15.637 --> 28:16.971
- you didn't do it yourself.
- Mm-hmm.

28:39.160 --> 28:41.996
Hey, where are you?

28:43.898 --> 28:44.933
Are you in here?

28:46.201 --> 28:47.602
Come on, where are you?

28:49.771 --> 28:51.106
Oh, there you are.

28:51.139 --> 28:52.841
What are you doing?

28:54.075 --> 28:55.610
What's going on with you?

28:56.412 --> 28:58.012
You playing hide and go seek?

28:59.147 --> 29:00.315
- Who are you?
- Okay.

29:02.451 --> 29:03.751
Oh, my God.

29:10.358 --> 29:13.328
I used to do automatic writing,

29:13.361 --> 29:17.799
and I was told what to write by
spirit.

29:17.832 --> 29:19.401
It's implanted in your
brain?

29:19.435 --> 29:20.335
- Yeah.
- And you just transfer it

29:20.368 --> 29:24.005
from some other entity
that's telling you what

29:24.038 --> 29:24.706
to write down

29:24.739 --> 29:26.141
Yeah, it's that sort of thing.

29:26.174 --> 29:27.876
Like my guardian

29:27.909 --> 29:29.110
I have a guardian

29:29.144 --> 29:31.679
that I, he, he's always there.

29:31.713 --> 29:32.981
I always, he's gonna

29:35.016 --> 29:39.287
just let me know something is
not right.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.923
- Mm-hmm.
- If it's going to

29:41.956 --> 29:45.026
be a good thing or something
I...

29:46.127 --> 29:48.329
Sator is like a human being

29:48.363 --> 29:51.032
that lives around here
somewhere.

29:51.065 --> 29:54.802
Somebody who manages to get into
my brain

29:54.836 --> 29:57.739
and talk to me. Knew everybody,

29:57.772 --> 29:59.240
what they were saying and doing.

29:59.274 --> 30:02.177
And he was aware of
everything that was done

30:02.210 --> 30:04.846
and what should be done
and what has to be done,

30:04.879 --> 30:05.980
what wasn't done.

30:06.014 --> 30:08.783
How you people are this and
that.

30:08.816 --> 30:13.254
Sator would help me, was
teaching me,

30:13.288 --> 30:16.925
training me to be a person.

30:16.958 --> 30:20.061
Every once in a while,
I just wake up in bed

30:20.094 --> 30:21.829
and he's there.

30:21.863 --> 30:23.031
He talks to me.

30:25.233 --> 30:29.270
It's interesting to have that
kind

30:29.304 --> 30:33.808
of care. The talking in my head.

30:33.841 --> 30:35.411
I have nothing to do with it.

30:35.444 --> 30:38.112
It just starts, and I listen,

30:38.146 --> 30:40.449
and if I'm supposed
to write it down.

30:40.482 --> 30:43.751
I write it down or whatever.

30:43.785 --> 30:44.986
I don't know.

30:45.019 --> 30:47.222
People think you're nuts
if you tell them that.

30:47.255 --> 30:48.323
Well I don't think
you're nuts.

30:48.356 --> 30:51.793
Oh good, I hope not.

30:59.867 --> 31:03.071
Although, when I feel
like wanting something

31:03.104 --> 31:05.907
that I want to know about

31:05.940 --> 31:07.075
or think about

31:07.108 --> 31:08.910
or something, I just think about
it

31:08.943 --> 31:12.947
and he comes in my brain,

31:12.981 --> 31:17.085
or he manages to

31:17.118 --> 31:19.521
make me aware of him,

31:19.555 --> 31:22.391
talks to me and do, you know,

31:22.424 --> 31:25.126
make me do some things and
stuff.

31:25.159 --> 31:28.397
That was just a period of time.

31:28.430 --> 31:29.998
- Mm-hmm.
- Then I went off

31:30.031 --> 31:34.436
on my own way, I'd guess you'd
say.

31:34.470 --> 31:37.338
I still wrote stuff.

31:37.372 --> 31:38.574
What's that for?

31:38.607 --> 31:41.042
I would hear
from him occasionally,

31:41.075 --> 31:43.311
have something written to me.

31:43.344 --> 31:45.447
When I've taken something

31:45.481 --> 31:48.349
- and tried to write on it,
- Come on.

31:48.384 --> 31:50.386
He gets in there

31:50.419 --> 31:53.221
and telling me I should not be
saying

31:53.254 --> 31:55.056
and doing what I was doing and
saying.

31:55.089 --> 31:57.526
My dog ran off.

31:57.559 --> 32:00.295
I'm sorry.

32:00.328 --> 32:02.297
Things got so
complicated

32:02.330 --> 32:04.299
and too many people involved.

32:04.332 --> 32:07.168
- Think something hurt him?
- He still gets

32:07.201 --> 32:09.137
a word in every once in a while

32:09.170 --> 32:10.338
that I'm aware of.

32:11.339 --> 32:15.009
Although he did, he talked to
James. Jimmy.

32:16.944 --> 32:20.449
I'll keep an eye out.

32:22.484 --> 32:23.552
I don't know any more.

32:24.553 --> 32:27.922
Time has swallowed it all up.

32:27.955 --> 32:30.091
Well that's
very interesting, Nani.

32:31.092 --> 32:32.927
I had voices.

32:32.960 --> 32:34.463
I get messages,

32:34.496 --> 32:36.532
and I still do in a sense.

32:39.200 --> 32:41.269
And he comes to the house.

32:41.302 --> 32:42.370
He comes here,

32:44.038 --> 32:45.940
Sator does, often.

32:45.973 --> 32:49.243
And just not in this particular
area

32:49.277 --> 32:52.514
but out there where he
comes and stands around

32:52.548 --> 32:56.351
and and just
watches what I'm doing

32:56.385 --> 32:59.287
or whoever else is there, you
know,

32:59.320 --> 33:00.622
he watches them.

33:00.656 --> 33:02.591
And it still happens.

33:02.624 --> 33:06.127
I still get messages from Sator.

33:08.597 --> 33:10.965
Ugh, Sator can fuck
off, dude!

33:11.734 --> 33:13.301
I don't know
what else to do, dude,

33:13.334 --> 33:14.536
and like, he's holding
Ma hostage somewhere

33:14.570 --> 33:16.304
and doesn't want her to fucking
remember.

33:17.271 --> 33:18.106
Goddammit.

33:21.643 --> 33:24.546
I don't know, maybe, I think
I need a cigarette right now.

33:27.181 --> 33:29.117
Seriously though, Brother.

33:29.150 --> 33:30.452
trips me the fuck out what the
brain chooses

33:30.486 --> 33:32.153
to hold on to.

33:36.290 --> 33:38.394
Like helping
Grandpa Jim build his cabin.

33:39.428 --> 33:41.996
I have this image really
fucking clear in my mind.

33:42.029 --> 33:44.999
But then I found a photograph of
this,

33:45.032 --> 33:46.167
and that's what I'm actually
seeing

33:46.200 --> 33:47.536
is a damn photograph.

33:50.839 --> 33:52.574
I don't remember that day at
all.

33:54.275 --> 33:56.010
It's the same shit with Evie.

33:56.043 --> 33:57.178
I have all these photographs,

33:57.211 --> 33:59.147
but I can't remember her or the
accident.

33:59.180 --> 34:00.348
And that shit was recent.

34:01.315 --> 34:04.318
But we were fucked up
most of the time together.

34:04.352 --> 34:06.154
So I guess that's different.

34:19.333 --> 34:21.437
This is
Sator.

34:21.470 --> 34:24.640
Your path to purification

34:24.673 --> 34:27.443
will be tried with fire,

34:27.476 --> 34:32.481
only then will I make you in my
image.

34:32.648 --> 34:37.653
But first, I will send a
messenger to your temple.

34:40.154 --> 34:44.526
One who shall prepare the way
before you.

34:47.429 --> 34:49.263
Are you fucking
kidding?

34:49.297 --> 34:51.199
What the fuck?

34:58.206 --> 35:03.211
For this messenger will
be like a refiner's fire,

35:03.512 --> 35:07.382
and will sit as a refiner.

35:07.416 --> 35:09.685
Are you ready

35:09.718 --> 35:12.654
to have dominion

35:12.688 --> 35:17.659
over every creeping thing that
creeps?

35:19.661 --> 35:23.164
Ready to cleansed

35:23.197 --> 35:24.533
and purified.

35:25.233 --> 35:30.204
To join Sator as one of his
disciples.

35:31.540 --> 35:34.208
I am now waiting

35:35.410 --> 35:37.278
for your burnt offering.

35:38.814 --> 35:43.217
I delight in burnt
offerings and sacrifices

35:45.454 --> 35:48.557
just as much as you,

35:48.590 --> 35:50.124
obeying my voice.

36:19.353 --> 36:20.288
Hi, Adam.

36:23.224 --> 36:24.826
Your dog ever come back?

36:30.131 --> 36:32.133
I brought you something.

36:34.503 --> 36:36.405
It was hidden at your
grandmother's.

36:39.240 --> 36:40.374
I didn't know when you would be
back,

36:40.409 --> 36:43.244
so I thought you might wanna
have it.

37:44.338 --> 37:46.775
It was with Pete in that
accident.

37:48.644 --> 37:50.311
Glad he made it out okay.

38:32.921 --> 38:34.956
Thought that'd be a nice memory
to have.

39:03.852 --> 39:05.554
Sorry about your mom.

39:07.422 --> 39:09.391
Was anybody able to find her?

39:17.599 --> 39:19.668
I was in a similar situation,

39:20.602 --> 39:24.573
and Pete was the only
person I had to go to.

39:26.307 --> 39:29.778
I think you're lucky to
have someone like Deborah.

39:30.812 --> 39:35.016
She really kept it together
for the both of you.

39:37.519 --> 39:40.489
I hope one day the three
of you can come together.

42:29.257 --> 42:33.628
Sator has
searched you and he knows you.

42:33.662 --> 42:37.232
He knows when you rest and when
you rise.

42:37.265 --> 42:40.802
He perceives your thoughts from
afar.

42:40.835 --> 42:43.505
He observes you're going out

42:43.538 --> 42:47.208
and is familiar with all your
ways.

42:47.242 --> 42:50.812
When you lay your hand upon
Sator,

42:50.845 --> 42:54.482
such knowledge will be too
wonderful,

42:54.516 --> 42:57.018
too high for you to attain.

43:57.380 --> 43:59.748
There is nothing covered up

43:59.781 --> 44:01.616
that will not be revealed,

44:01.649 --> 44:04.919
and secrets that will not be
known.

44:05.687 --> 44:10.191
He who reveals the
profound and the hidden,

44:10.225 --> 44:12.660
will know what is in the
darkness.

44:14.829 --> 44:18.033
What can't be seen in the dark,

44:18.066 --> 44:20.201
can be shown in the light.

45:42.250 --> 45:43.818
Well, I don't know what

45:43.852 --> 45:46.087
to fucking tell you, Brother.

45:46.121 --> 45:46.988
Your dog's gone.

45:56.331 --> 46:00.768
Should have held it
together for Deborah.

46:00.802 --> 46:02.637
So fucked, this was all put on
her.

46:14.782 --> 46:16.184
Shouldn't have to put
up with all our bullshit.

46:31.933 --> 46:34.903
I still think grandpa
Jim sacrificed himself.

46:34.936 --> 46:38.106
So Ma could be with Sator.

46:38.139 --> 46:40.208
You know there was a lot of
weird shit going on there.

46:40.241 --> 46:42.877
I don't think Mom could have
fucking done that herself.

46:43.845 --> 46:45.113
Bet Nani was in on it too.

47:01.397 --> 47:03.264
Sorry we couldn't find your dog,
dude

47:18.380 --> 47:22.050
What's going on with you,
Brother?

48:30.151 --> 48:33.288
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

48:37.393 --> 48:38.860
We want cake!

48:38.893 --> 48:40.194
We want cake!

48:40.228 --> 48:41.430
We want cake!

48:41.597 --> 48:42.930
We want cake!

48:43.264 --> 48:44.433
We want cake!

48:49.638 --> 48:51.540
- What is this thing?
- Ooh!

48:53.341 --> 48:56.377
Got in there, an atomic
bomb?

49:02.384 --> 49:03.419
What?

49:03.452 --> 49:05.387
Shouldn't Ma be here for this?

49:05.421 --> 49:06.622
You really
think you're gonna get her

49:06.655 --> 49:08.289
- to come out here?
- I'm not going

49:08.323 --> 49:09.625
back there, Deborah.

49:24.906 --> 49:28.176
First I will send a
messenger

49:29.511 --> 49:31.380
to your temple.

49:31.413 --> 49:34.550
One who shall prepare the way
before you.

49:38.252 --> 49:40.221
Are you fucking
kidding me?

49:40.254 --> 49:41.590
What the fuck?

49:55.471 --> 49:57.138
Go back there.

50:03.512 --> 50:05.547
We need to burn those fucking
writings.

50:08.484 --> 50:10.552
I wanna get
Adam out of this place.

50:11.219 --> 50:14.222
You wanna take him to
Midground and go see Evie?

50:18.394 --> 50:19.528
Or not.

50:19.561 --> 50:21.530
Do you think that's
smart?

50:21.563 --> 50:23.131
Hmm?

50:23.164 --> 50:24.966
Having him around that many
people?

50:30.371 --> 50:31.239
Adam?

50:35.042 --> 50:35.910
Adam?

50:40.716 --> 50:41.583
Hey?

50:50.526 --> 50:52.059
Did I hurt you?

50:52.093 --> 50:53.961
Where do
you go when you do that?

50:56.264 --> 50:57.331
Anyone talking to you?

51:00.168 --> 51:02.671
Like with Nani and Mom?

51:06.775 --> 51:08.309
Is it Sator?

1:01:28.963 --> 1:01:29.864
Uhhhahh!!

1:05:48.490 --> 1:05:49.957
Do you know what
these are?

1:05:49.991 --> 1:05:52.160
It's my handwriting,
but I, it,

1:05:52.193 --> 1:05:54.862
I can't read it anymore here.

1:05:54.896 --> 1:05:56.498
They're
your automatic writings.

1:05:56.532 --> 1:05:58.066
Yeah. Oh.

1:05:58.099 --> 1:06:00.502
- You'd get in trances and
- Yeah.

1:06:00.536 --> 1:06:02.970
- spirits would write for you.
- Yeah, well somewhere

1:06:03.004 --> 1:06:04.906
along the lines there,

1:06:04.939 --> 1:06:09.010
I wanted to have something
going on in my life.

1:06:09.778 --> 1:06:14.949
The next thing I found
out was that in my head,

1:06:14.982 --> 1:06:19.987
I was being told about things.

1:06:20.188 --> 1:06:21.623
For a long time there,

1:06:21.657 --> 1:06:25.993
I was writing down stuff
that was given to me,

1:06:27.295 --> 1:06:30.231
like people talking to me.

1:06:31.600 --> 1:06:34.102
So I would listen, just listen,

1:06:34.135 --> 1:06:36.505
and write down what was
being said in my head.

1:06:36.538 --> 1:06:40.975
You know, I had access to them.

1:06:41.008 --> 1:06:43.645
Even now I can see them.

1:06:43.679 --> 1:06:48.883
The people hopping around
in my head.

1:06:52.488 --> 1:06:54.490
Did you know mom
was also able to hear them?

1:06:54.523 --> 1:06:56.324
Your mother you're
talking about?

1:06:56.357 --> 1:06:57.225
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

1:06:57.892 --> 1:07:00.128
I think she
was trying to join them.

1:07:00.161 --> 1:07:02.664
- Well, it's a good possibility.
- Yeah.

1:07:03.632 --> 1:07:04.500
Look at this one.

1:07:07.001 --> 1:07:10.539
"They've chosen you from
the furnace of affliction.

1:07:11.540 --> 1:07:16.545
You may now present an offering
by fire before purification

1:07:17.546 --> 1:07:20.148
as a soothing aroma to Sator."

1:07:22.250 --> 1:07:23.251
Hmm.

1:07:25.186 --> 1:07:27.489
Do you remember the day
that Grandpa Jim died?

1:07:29.323 --> 1:07:31.159
Yes. That was sad.

1:07:32.994 --> 1:07:37.499
He seemed to be involved
in it quite a lot,

1:07:37.533 --> 1:07:42.336
and we had discussed his
dying somewhere before,

1:07:43.439 --> 1:07:45.707
that this is what he is
intending to do.

1:07:45.741 --> 1:07:49.277
And he walked out of the house

1:07:49.310 --> 1:07:53.080
and went out laid down in the
grass and

1:07:55.417 --> 1:08:00.422
and we found him, and he died
there.

1:08:01.623 --> 1:08:05.494
That's all I remember at this
time.

1:08:05.527 --> 1:08:07.995
- Yeah.
- 'Cause he died.

1:08:09.398 --> 1:08:10.298
Mm-hmm.

1:08:12.099 --> 1:08:13.334
Um...

1:08:13.367 --> 1:08:16.137
His death
caused Pete to get into

1:08:16.170 --> 1:08:19.140
- a lot of trouble with Evie.
- Oh my, yeah.

1:08:20.241 --> 1:08:22.243
He's been in a home now for a
while.

1:08:23.545 --> 1:08:25.447
He gets out today.

1:08:25.481 --> 1:08:27.315
- Oh.
- I get to pick him up.

1:08:27.348 --> 1:08:28.216
Oh.

1:08:30.385 --> 1:08:32.320
We have to show him how proud
we are of him.

1:08:32.353 --> 1:08:35.189
For all the progress he's
been making to get better.

1:08:35.223 --> 1:08:38.092
Yes, yes,
that's important to him.

1:08:38.694 --> 1:08:40.228
Do you think
that you can help me

1:08:40.261 --> 1:08:42.464
- with that, Nani?
- Sure, yeah.

1:08:43.398 --> 1:08:45.734
I can try.

1:08:45.767 --> 1:08:47.268
Thanks.

1:09:40.354 --> 1:09:42.089
Think it's genetic?

1:09:42.123 --> 1:09:43.625
What, dementia?

1:09:43.659 --> 1:09:44.526
The voices.

1:09:45.226 --> 1:09:47.796
Well if it is, I'm glad
Nani never hurt anybody.

1:09:49.130 --> 1:09:50.131
Ma didn't either.

1:09:52.734 --> 1:09:54.570
If you still think
Sator killed Grandpa Jim,

1:09:54.603 --> 1:09:56.237
we can send you back there right
now.

1:09:56.270 --> 1:09:57.706
I have no problem with that.

1:09:57.739 --> 1:09:58.540
What about Adam?

1:09:58.574 --> 1:10:00.475
- What about him?
- Can we visit him?

1:10:00.509 --> 1:10:01.375
No.

1:10:03.344 --> 1:10:05.414
I feel bad for just
leaving them up there.

1:10:07.616 --> 1:10:08.850
Excuse me?

1:10:09.818 --> 1:10:13.187
You feel bad because
you left him up there?

1:10:13.220 --> 1:10:15.189
Did you even see how
it wasn't exactly safe

1:10:15.222 --> 1:10:16.592
for him to be around us?

1:10:16.625 --> 1:10:18.359
'Cause I don't remember
you making the decision

1:10:18.393 --> 1:10:21.396
to isolate him from
everyone because you didn't.

1:10:21.430 --> 1:10:23.364
I left him out there.

1:10:23.398 --> 1:10:24.900
Give me a goddamn break, Pete.

1:10:24.933 --> 1:10:25.801
Mm.

1:10:27.502 --> 1:10:29.236
It's been nice talking
to a friendly face,

1:10:29.270 --> 1:10:30.806
but I must find my brother and
get home.

1:10:30.839 --> 1:10:33.274
I have a long road ahead of me,
and I can't waste any more time.

1:10:35.944 --> 1:10:37.211
Mm.

1:10:37.244 --> 1:10:38.480
Right at home

1:10:38.513 --> 1:10:41.783
with the people, the
beaches, the cool waves.

1:10:43.250 --> 1:10:44.786
Welcome to Midground.

1:10:44.820 --> 1:10:47.489
A perfect family vacation.

1:10:47.522 --> 1:10:49.858
Come stay in the Blaze Inn
Hotel,

1:10:49.891 --> 1:10:52.628
with breathtaking views
of Younglove Island.

1:10:52.661 --> 1:10:54.396
Take leisurely strolls...

1:11:19.588 --> 1:11:20.455
Mm.

1:11:25.460 --> 1:11:27.161
You want company?

1:11:29.631 --> 1:11:30.899
I'm all right.

1:11:50.317 --> 1:11:51.185
Mm.

1:14:08.423 --> 1:14:09.090
Adam?

1:14:24.539 --> 1:14:25.407
Hmm.

1:15:19.861 --> 1:15:20.762
Ehh.

1:17:41.636 --> 1:17:42.303
Ah.

1:17:48.309 --> 1:17:50.645
You going to get ready for
bed, Nani?

1:18:39.994 --> 1:18:40.962
Hey, Nani?

1:18:59.180 --> 1:19:00.048
Nani?

1:19:36.317 --> 1:19:37.185
Nani?

1:21:17.885 --> 1:21:18.621
No!

1:22:48.976 --> 1:22:53.348
Doesn't anyone talk
to you in your head.

1:22:53.382 --> 1:22:56.618
I don't know how to explain it.

1:22:56.652 --> 1:22:59.253
It's just, it's been given to
me.

1:23:00.656 --> 1:23:03.559
Sator will send messages
that land in my head.

1:23:04.292 --> 1:23:08.664
And so do the other
people who if they want to

1:23:08.697 --> 1:23:12.967
will just talk to me.

1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:14.936
Right here, talking to me.

1:23:28.450 --> 1:23:29.917
Like you now...

1:23:31.986 --> 1:23:33.555
What is it that you need?

1:23:39.127 --> 1:23:40.895
What do you want to know for
sure?

1:23:42.731 --> 1:23:44.031
That Sator loves you?

1:23:45.601 --> 1:23:47.301
That he cares about you?

1:23:50.037 --> 1:23:51.272
That you're being good?

1:23:54.208 --> 1:23:56.244
That you're not being good

1:23:56.277 --> 1:23:57.145
about some things,

1:23:58.346 --> 1:24:03.351
a little antagonistic,
at times.

1:24:07.221 --> 1:24:10.459
Well, I don't know where this
comes from.

1:24:12.728 --> 1:24:16.364
I find you quite well organized,

1:24:16.398 --> 1:24:20.469
and take good care of me and
what's here.

1:24:25.206 --> 1:24:27.576
And I get this voice saying,

1:24:27.609 --> 1:24:30.211
and does what we tell you to.

1:24:42.056 --> 1:24:43.324
Okay, your turn.

1:24:52.534 --> 1:24:54.302
Any messages coming?
