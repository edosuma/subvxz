03:52.875 --> 03:55.708
- I was staring at your fish.

03:55.750 --> 03:56.833
That's a cute one.

03:56.834 --> 03:58.957
It's got little bug eyes.

03:58.958 --> 04:00.542
Is that your fish?

04:00.583 --> 04:02.917
When I was little,
I had a fish.

04:02.958 --> 04:04.542
I had a tropical fish.

04:04.583 --> 04:05.542
It was bad.

04:05.583 --> 04:07.250
I put the heater on,

04:07.292 --> 04:08.498
and I left,
and when I came back,

04:08.499 --> 04:10.167
they were all over the floor,
poor bastards.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.623
All right, well, this is me.

04:11.624 --> 04:12.625
Nice meeting you.

04:12.626 --> 04:14.708
Hey, take care of that fish.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.375
- Hello?

04:17.416 --> 04:19.124
Yes, hello.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.250
Hello, yes, one second.

04:21.291 --> 04:24.332
It's... it's for you.
No?

04:24.333 --> 04:26.417
Uh, you just missed him.

04:29.625 --> 04:30.833
- Right here, Donny.

04:30.875 --> 04:32.792
Look.

04:32.833 --> 04:35.708
Bring it to your gut,
right to your gut.

04:37.083 --> 04:40.667
All that strength,
all that evil, all that force.

04:41.625 --> 04:43.083
Yeah, you saw that shit, right?

04:49.000 --> 04:50.875
Rah! Rah! Rah!

05:16.833 --> 05:18.000
Anything good?

05:18.042 --> 05:20.166
Don't bring any cell phones,
all right?

05:20.167 --> 05:21.500
- What? I can't hear you.

05:23.167 --> 05:26.000
- I said don't bring
any more cell phones!

05:26.042 --> 05:27.542
- I'll be there in a few.

05:45.417 --> 05:46.583
Yo, Slim.

05:46.625 --> 05:49.208
- What's up, Bobby?
- What up, baby?

05:49.250 --> 05:50.708
Uh, give me three loosies.

05:52.292 --> 05:54.124
There you go.

05:54.125 --> 05:55.542
Thanks, buddy.

06:02.542 --> 06:04.042
- Get your ass in here.

06:09.167 --> 06:12.083
I'm taking you off the case.

06:12.125 --> 06:13.375
- Just like that?

06:13.417 --> 06:15.624
- Don't give me
the "just like that" shit.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.333
You are already on probation.

06:17.375 --> 06:19.875
This is supposed to be
a coffee and cake job

06:19.917 --> 06:21.375
to keep you out on the street.

06:21.417 --> 06:24.791
And by the way, this kid,
he's hysterical.

06:24.792 --> 06:26.707
You know what he did yesterday?

06:26.708 --> 06:29.124
He took himself a cab
up to the Bronx.

06:29.125 --> 06:30.542
Instead of paying,
what does he do?

06:30.583 --> 06:32.417
He whips out your badge,

06:32.458 --> 06:34.583
and he says,
"Official police business."

06:36.458 --> 06:38.166
- Got some balls.

06:38.167 --> 06:39.833
- You know who told me
that story?

06:39.834 --> 06:41.750
The mayor.

06:41.792 --> 06:43.542
The same mayor
who's been talking to me

06:43.583 --> 06:45.457
about becoming commissioner.

06:45.458 --> 06:47.873
The same Mayor that I've been
talking to on your behalf

06:47.874 --> 06:49.208
about becoming chief of police.

06:49.250 --> 06:51.917
What the hell's
going on with you, Sully?

06:51.958 --> 06:53.708
30 years.

06:53.750 --> 06:54.750
What are we gonna do,

06:54.792 --> 06:56.208
let this whole thing
crumble to the ground

06:56.209 --> 06:58.708
because of this punk?

06:58.750 --> 06:59.999
- I'll fix it.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
- Get your badge back.

07:02.042 --> 07:05.291
I don't give a flying shit
what you have to do.

07:05.292 --> 07:08.332
Restore some dignity
to this department.

07:08.333 --> 07:10.000
Read 'em and weep.

07:10.042 --> 07:11.625
You're famous.

07:13.375 --> 07:14.375
- It's a good picture.

07:17.125 --> 07:18.708
- Get the hell out of my office.

07:25.583 --> 07:26.833
- Listen,
I told this guy already.

07:26.875 --> 07:27.875
I'm not a pickpocket.

07:27.876 --> 07:29.583
I'm a pilates instructor.

07:29.625 --> 07:31.542
I'm actually late for my...
- Why don't you shut up?

07:31.543 --> 07:32.750
- Here we go.

07:42.208 --> 07:43.708
Where are we going?
- Let's go for a little walk.

07:43.750 --> 07:45.000
- What's back here?

07:45.042 --> 07:46.333
Oh, the doughnuts.

07:46.334 --> 07:48.042
Man, I got my rights over here.

07:48.083 --> 07:49.208
Come on.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.417
Christ almighty.

07:53.458 --> 07:57.874
- Hold that.

07:57.875 --> 07:59.500
- Oh, my God, is this you?

08:01.792 --> 08:05.125
You have to sign that for me.

08:09.167 --> 08:11.457
- Prick!

08:11.458 --> 08:12.458
I want a name!

08:14.750 --> 08:16.208
- Jax!

08:16.250 --> 08:17.250
Yo!

08:20.833 --> 08:22.125
Jax!

08:32.000 --> 08:33.666
What's up, Donny?

08:33.667 --> 08:35.332
They ever gonna fix that buzzer?

08:59.042 --> 09:01.166
- This is nice.

09:01.167 --> 09:02.667
It's real leather.

09:12.917 --> 09:15.332
Hey, Bobby.

09:15.333 --> 09:16.333
- Mm-hmm.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.167
- Are you deaf?

09:25.250 --> 09:27.417
- No.

09:27.458 --> 09:28.999
- What is this?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.917
What is this?

09:30.958 --> 09:33.999
- Cell phones.
- Cell phones.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.166
Cell phones.

09:35.167 --> 09:36.375
What did I tell you
on the phone?

09:36.417 --> 09:37.375
- You said no cell phones?

09:37.417 --> 09:39.417
I thought you said you wanted
cell phones; I'm sorry.

09:39.458 --> 09:40.417
I got it.

09:40.458 --> 09:41.583
I got it.
No more cell phones.

09:41.625 --> 09:43.999
- You got it.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.250
A bunch of junk, as usual.

09:47.292 --> 09:50.083
Give me the cash.

09:50.125 --> 09:52.875
- Here.

09:52.917 --> 09:54.667
- You're not holding out?

09:57.542 --> 09:59.208
Here.

10:01.250 --> 10:02.499
- This is it?

10:02.500 --> 10:04.957
- That's it, Bobby.

10:04.958 --> 10:05.958
Oh, you want more money?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.125
- Yeah, I work all day.

10:07.126 --> 10:08.123
I want more.

10:08.124 --> 10:09.167
- Oh. You want more?
- Yeah, I want more.

10:09.208 --> 10:10.208
- I got to eat too.

10:10.250 --> 10:11.458
- Bring me better shit,

10:11.459 --> 10:13.917
gold, diamonds,

10:13.958 --> 10:16.999
not a bunch of trinkets
and junk.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.833
- You know I don't
swipe diamonds, okay?

10:19.875 --> 10:20.917
- You don't steal diamonds.

10:20.958 --> 10:23.124
Oh, I forgot.
Oh, great.

10:23.125 --> 10:24.957
It's too personal.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.583
But you take watches.
Hmm.

10:27.625 --> 10:29.583
- Every jackass
has a watch, right?

10:29.625 --> 10:32.542
You got a watch?

10:32.583 --> 10:33.957
- You're really funny.

10:33.958 --> 10:35.791
You're a funny guy.

10:35.792 --> 10:38.250
You want to steal what you want,
steal what you want.

10:38.292 --> 10:40.957
You're just going to be working
for me the rest of your life.

10:40.958 --> 10:44.250
Everybody's got a man
they got to answer to.

10:44.292 --> 10:46.332
I got a man I got to answer to.

10:46.333 --> 10:49.124
- I know.

10:49.125 --> 10:51.375
- And so do you.
You got a man to answer to.

10:52.292 --> 10:53.292
Me.

11:16.833 --> 11:18.792
- Excuse me.

11:25.833 --> 11:27.999
- Thank you so much
for finding my wallet

11:28.000 --> 11:29.500
and giving it back to me.

11:29.542 --> 11:32.041
I feel like, in this city,

11:32.042 --> 11:34.750
I just feel like people really
don't help strangers, you know?

11:34.792 --> 11:36.999
- Yeah, life is weird
like that.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.208
Sometimes it just
creates situations

11:39.250 --> 11:41.917
that throw
two people together, you know?

11:41.958 --> 11:42.917
- Kinda romantic.

11:44.958 --> 11:46.000
I'm a romantic guy.

11:47.042 --> 11:48.041
- Oh, thanks.

11:48.042 --> 11:49.917
- Hey, no, no, no, I'm going to
pay for this, okay'?

11:49.958 --> 11:50.917
- No, I couldn't.
Really.

11:50.958 --> 11:52.375
I mean, I would never want you
to think

11:52.417 --> 11:54.375
that my kindness had
anything to do with, you know,

11:54.417 --> 11:56.208
wanting something in return.

11:56.250 --> 11:58.707
Thanks.
- Wow.

11:58.708 --> 12:01.708
- Hey, listen up, they just got
a red flag on that credit card

12:01.750 --> 12:03.417
that was stolen this morning
on the subway.

12:03.458 --> 12:04.500
Tazza restaurant.

12:04.501 --> 12:07.833
- No squad cars,
no uniforms, okay?

12:13.000 --> 12:14.792
- I'm afraid
your card was declined.

12:14.793 --> 12:15.875
- Declined?

12:15.917 --> 12:17.417
- All right, this is
the universe saying

12:17.458 --> 12:18.417
I'm gonna pay for it.

12:18.458 --> 12:20.375
- No, no, I got another one.

12:20.417 --> 12:22.833
Sometimes there's, like,
a computer glitch or something.

12:24.583 --> 12:26.583
That's embarrassing.

12:26.625 --> 12:29.750
- Sir, just talk to you
for a second, privately?

12:29.792 --> 12:30.750
- Yeah, sure.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.458
Excuse us for one second.

12:35.458 --> 12:37.250
- The name on this card
isn't even the same

12:37.292 --> 12:39.457
as the one on the first one.

12:39.458 --> 12:41.875
- Really?

12:41.917 --> 12:42.875
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:42.917 --> 12:44.083
Listen, I apologize.

12:44.125 --> 12:45.083
I mean, this is the one

12:45.125 --> 12:46.583
that I usually put
the $100 tips on,

12:46.625 --> 12:48.708
but if you want
a different one, I...

12:48.750 --> 12:51.499
- Oh, yeah.
No, my mistake.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.500
- We good?

12:52.542 --> 12:56.417
- Yeah, I think we're good
Mr. Fujimoto.

12:56.458 --> 12:57.500
- It's Fugimato, Fugimato.

12:57.501 --> 12:59.500
- Ooh, my mistake.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.666
- The other day,
I was totally walking home

13:05.667 --> 13:07.333
with two of the people
from my band.

13:07.375 --> 13:09.000
We were, like, three blocks
from my house,

13:09.042 --> 13:10.542
and I turn back,
and I see this guy

13:10.583 --> 13:12.165
who's kind of walking
kind of creepy.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.833
- Can you hold that story
for one second?

13:13.834 --> 13:16.666
I just have to use
the little boys' room.

13:16.667 --> 13:18.167
Don't go anywhere.
- I won't.

13:25.083 --> 13:27.583
- Excuse me.

13:27.625 --> 13:31.124
- Are you having a problem
with a credit card?

13:31.125 --> 13:34.417
- He was at this table.
- Thanks.

13:34.458 --> 13:35.500
- Where did he go?

13:35.542 --> 13:37.832
- Well, he went to the bathroom.

13:37.833 --> 13:40.832
- Bathroom's back there.

13:40.833 --> 13:41.833
Do I get to keep the tip?

13:46.042 --> 13:47.625
- Whose cuffs are they?

14:07.125 --> 14:08.833
- Bobby!

14:08.875 --> 14:10.083
Bobby!

14:10.750 --> 14:12.707
Bobby!

14:12.708 --> 14:13.833
- What? What?
What's the matter?

14:13.875 --> 14:14.875
- There's a rat!

14:14.876 --> 14:17.666
- It's just a mouse, Ma!

14:17.667 --> 14:18.666
- Ugh!

14:18.667 --> 14:21.375
- Ow!
The mouse, Ma, not me.

14:21.417 --> 14:23.167
- It ran over there.

14:25.542 --> 14:27.250
Bobby!

14:28.792 --> 14:29.750
It's over there!

14:29.792 --> 14:31.500
There, it's running.
Hurry up!

14:31.542 --> 14:32.542
- Where, where, where?

14:32.543 --> 14:35.041
- Right under the refrigerator!

14:35.042 --> 14:36.083
- It got away.

14:40.708 --> 14:44.208
Hey, you okay?
You all right?

14:44.250 --> 14:47.250
- I hate those things.

14:47.292 --> 14:49.499
- Jesus, Ma.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.332
You tryin' to kill me?

14:51.333 --> 14:52.875
If I caught a heart attack,
who would pay the rent?

15:00.125 --> 15:02.291
- I'm goin' over
to the church tonight,

15:02.292 --> 15:05.291
and I was thinking I could
leave your dinner in the fridge.

15:05.292 --> 15:07.542
- I'll just grab a burger
or somethin'.

15:07.583 --> 15:09.250
- You want a burger,
I'll make you a burger.

15:09.292 --> 15:11.208
I'll leave it in the fridge.

15:11.250 --> 15:13.125
- Okay. Fine.
Thanks.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.625
- You got a couple of dollars
I could use for bingo tonight?

15:22.625 --> 15:24.499
- Again with the gambling, Ma?

15:24.500 --> 15:25.667
You know
I don't like you gambling.

15:25.708 --> 15:26.708
You want to end up like Pop?

15:26.709 --> 15:28.333
- What gambling?
It's bingo.

15:28.375 --> 15:29.583
It's at the church.

15:29.625 --> 15:32.375
- Okay.

15:32.417 --> 15:35.957
But I'm not paying off
your debts when you're gone.

15:35.958 --> 15:37.833
I had enough of that
for one lifetime.

15:57.583 --> 15:59.208
- Work good?

15:59.250 --> 16:00.750
- Mm-hmm.

16:03.292 --> 16:06.124
- Stocks up this month?

16:06.125 --> 16:07.167
- Yeah.

16:10.458 --> 16:11.708
- You're a good boy, Bobby.

17:07.208 --> 17:08.375
- Hey.

17:08.416 --> 17:10.083
- Hey, uh...

17:10.125 --> 17:12.166
- Lucy.

17:12.208 --> 17:14.207
- Yeah, no, I... Lucy.

17:14.208 --> 17:16.916
I know.

17:16.958 --> 17:18.875
- I'm sorry.
I saw you from behind.

17:18.916 --> 17:20.625
I wasn't sure if it was you,
but...

17:22.291 --> 17:23.291
It was you.

17:27.916 --> 17:29.458
- It's been a...

17:34.167 --> 17:35.499
- Hi.

17:35.500 --> 17:36.498
- It's been a while.

17:36.499 --> 17:37.750
- Yeah, three months.

17:37.792 --> 17:39.833
- Yeah.
Wow.

17:41.958 --> 17:44.000
How are you...
- So what have you been up to?

17:44.042 --> 17:46.166
- I've been good.
- I'm good.

17:46.167 --> 17:47.542
Good.

17:47.583 --> 17:49.917
- Not much.

17:49.958 --> 17:52.457
I was just on my lunch break.

17:52.458 --> 17:54.000
- I tried calling you,

17:54.042 --> 17:57.667
but your phone was disconnected
or something.

17:57.708 --> 17:58.707
- Yeah.

17:58.708 --> 18:03.124
Yeah, no, I got a...
I got a new one.

18:03.125 --> 18:06.124
I mean, maybe we can get
together for lunch sometime

18:06.125 --> 18:07.375
and, you know, catch up.

18:07.417 --> 18:08.375
I'd do it now, but...

18:08.417 --> 18:11.166
- I'm pregnant.

18:11.167 --> 18:13.250
- You... you're what?

18:13.292 --> 18:14.292
- Pregnant.

18:17.583 --> 18:18.542
- Wow, that's...

18:18.583 --> 18:21.875
I mean, congratulations.

18:21.917 --> 18:24.374
That's really great.
I... that's... wow.

18:24.375 --> 18:27.042
How... how far along?

18:28.417 --> 18:29.458
- Three months.

18:32.583 --> 18:34.333
- You said three?

18:36.958 --> 18:38.000
- It's yours, Bobby.

18:42.083 --> 18:44.583
- Okay, hold on a second,

18:44.625 --> 18:46.708
because, you know, we only
did it that one night so...

18:46.750 --> 18:48.917
- Actually, we did it
a few times that night.

18:48.958 --> 18:50.999
- Right, but we only did it
that one night.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.833
Well, once is enough.

18:55.583 --> 18:57.667
- Okay, uh...

18:57.708 --> 19:00.000
Well, how do you know
it's mine?

19:03.125 --> 19:05.208
Hey! Hey!
That's a legitimate question.

19:05.250 --> 19:06.706
- What, you just think
I sleep around?

19:06.707 --> 19:08.000
You think I'm a slut
or something?

19:08.042 --> 19:09.667
- Well, we had
a one... night stand, so given...

19:09.668 --> 19:12.167
- You had a one... night stand.
I tried calling you.

19:12.958 --> 19:13.958
- Hey, listen, listen.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.417
- Don't touch me.
Don't ever touch me again.

19:15.458 --> 19:16.999
- Excuse me.
Ls everything okay?

19:17.000 --> 19:18.833
- Look, it's fine.
She's my girlfriend.

19:18.875 --> 19:20.999
- Oh, that's a laugh!

19:21.000 --> 19:22.583
- It's okay, officer.

19:22.625 --> 19:24.250
What are you trying to do,
get me arrested?

19:24.292 --> 19:26.375
Now, listen, you came
looking for me.

19:26.417 --> 19:28.042
I'm not gonna go chasing you
all over town.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.833
If you don't want to talk to me,
then fine.

19:29.875 --> 19:32.542
- First of all,
I didn't go looking for you.

19:32.583 --> 19:34.542
I pretty much wrote you off
three months ago.

19:34.583 --> 19:36.040
I happened to see you
standing there,

19:36.041 --> 19:37.250
thought maybe you'd like to know

19:37.292 --> 19:39.000
you're gonna have a kid
out there in the world

19:39.042 --> 19:40.250
in case you bump into it
one day.

19:40.292 --> 19:42.417
So now you know.

19:42.458 --> 19:44.375
You asshole.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.333
- Now, wait.
Just wait, will you?

19:51.417 --> 19:52.498
- What can I get you?

19:52.499 --> 19:53.500
- Hey, you got a loosie?

19:53.501 --> 19:54.499
- What?

19:54.500 --> 19:55.667
- Loosie, loosie.

19:55.708 --> 19:57.166
- Yeah, how'd you know?

19:57.167 --> 19:58.166
- What?

19:58.167 --> 19:59.542
- My name.
Lucy.

20:02.917 --> 20:05.374
- Psychic, I guess.

20:05.375 --> 20:06.417
- Hmm.

22:23.292 --> 22:24.667
- All right, all right,
all right.

22:29.917 --> 22:31.957
Your father's debt?

22:31.958 --> 22:34.583
Now it's your debt.

22:34.625 --> 22:37.208
From now on, you work for me.

23:13.875 --> 23:16.208
- Who am I?

23:16.250 --> 23:18.542
Who am I?

23:18.583 --> 23:20.917
Detective Bobby Correlli,
that's who I am.

23:20.958 --> 23:22.167
Right here.

23:24.083 --> 23:25.458
I see you.
What are you, a squirrel?

23:25.459 --> 23:28.291
Stop in the name of the law!

23:28.292 --> 23:29.542
- Hey, Bobby.

23:29.583 --> 23:30.750
Shut up!

23:30.792 --> 23:32.792
- Take you downtown,
and not for a drink either.

23:34.792 --> 23:38.583
- <i>Alex Rodriguez hits one
deep to left.</i>

23:45.125 --> 23:47.583
- Plate glass window I like it.

23:48.375 --> 23:50.000
Very Dirty Harry.

23:50.792 --> 23:53.542
- Listen, it was you.

23:53.583 --> 23:56.041
You said whatever it takes.

23:56.042 --> 23:57.667
- Thanks, Pete.

23:57.708 --> 23:59.375
That's what I like about you,
Sully.

23:59.417 --> 24:01.457
Always do everything
just the way you want,

24:01.458 --> 24:03.167
never give a shit
what anyone thinks.

24:04.792 --> 24:07.166
- Well, why should I stop now?

24:07.167 --> 24:08.542
It's my life.
It's what I do.

24:08.583 --> 24:09.542
What else am I gonna do?

24:09.583 --> 24:12.083
I'm not qualified
for anything else.

24:12.125 --> 24:13.417
- So what's next?

24:13.458 --> 24:15.957
- What's next?

24:15.958 --> 24:18.667
I'm gonna get my badge back,

24:18.708 --> 24:20.292
even if I have to
kill that little prick.

24:25.583 --> 24:27.624
Hey, good morning.

24:27.625 --> 24:28.750
- Who the hell are you?

24:32.875 --> 24:36.458
- Um, I'm Carl.

24:37.292 --> 24:40.166
- Oh, Carl.

24:40.167 --> 24:41.167
Ma!

24:42.333 --> 24:43.417
Ma!

24:43.458 --> 24:45.125
- Oh, Bobby I thought
you'd be at work by now.

24:45.126 --> 24:47.000
- Who the hell is this guy?

24:47.042 --> 24:48.498
- Carl.
- No, I got that.

24:48.499 --> 24:50.708
What the hell is Carl
doing here, in my bathrobe?

24:50.750 --> 24:51.708
- You didn't tell him.

24:51.750 --> 24:53.832
- I didn't get a chance.
I didn't get a chance.

24:53.833 --> 24:56.083
- Okay, so, Bob, I'm a...

24:56.125 --> 24:57.708
I'm a friend of your mother's.

24:57.750 --> 24:59.333
- He's a friend of mine
from bingo.

24:59.334 --> 25:00.833
- Wait a minute.

25:00.875 --> 25:02.708
Did this guy?
Did the two of you...

25:02.750 --> 25:03.708
Ah.

25:03.750 --> 25:04.917
- It's not what you think,
Bobby.

25:04.958 --> 25:06.125
We've been friends a long time.

25:06.126 --> 25:09.125
I didn't want to tell you,
but I think it's time.

25:09.167 --> 25:10.166
Yeah.

25:10.167 --> 25:11.542
Carl's asked me
to move in with him.

25:11.583 --> 25:13.166
It's not what you think.

25:13.167 --> 25:15.166
- What?
I'm gonna kill this guy.

25:15.167 --> 25:16.583
- He's funny.
He's an ex-Marine.

25:24.625 --> 25:27.333
- What happened?

25:27.375 --> 25:30.250
You look like the walking dead.

25:30.292 --> 25:32.792
- Well, death would be
a welcome relief

25:32.833 --> 25:34.750
compared to the world
of shit I live in right now.

25:34.792 --> 25:37.375
- Talk to me.
I got your back.

25:37.417 --> 25:38.417
Tell me.

25:40.542 --> 25:42.042
- I got a girl pregnant.

25:42.083 --> 25:43.042
- Ooh.

25:46.042 --> 25:48.417
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

25:48.458 --> 25:51.958
- That's funny.
Laugh it up.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.957
- Yeah, I got your back.

25:54.958 --> 25:57.500
Way back, way, way back.

25:59.208 --> 26:01.125
Like, Toledo back.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.667
- Thanks.

26:05.708 --> 26:08.332
I'm so screwed.

26:08.333 --> 26:09.332
- Let's see.

26:09.333 --> 26:10.332
- Ah!

26:10.333 --> 26:11.833
- She do that?
She punch you?

26:11.875 --> 26:14.957
- No, I fell down the stairs.

26:14.958 --> 26:16.666
- All right.

26:16.667 --> 26:18.667
What's she gonna do?
She gonna keep the kid?

26:20.333 --> 26:22.957
- I don't know.
That option never came up.

26:22.958 --> 26:28.374
- Why would she want to keep
a baby without a father?

26:28.375 --> 26:30.125
Especially your baby.

26:32.167 --> 26:33.667
Why don't you just give her
some money,

26:33.708 --> 26:35.042
tell her to get rid of it?

26:37.208 --> 26:40.500
You're gonna be up to your neck
in dirty diapers.

26:40.542 --> 26:43.875
Listen to me.
Like a mission to the moon.

26:44.375 --> 26:45.375
Abort.

26:52.750 --> 26:55.417
- Hey, listen, do you know
where I can find Lucy?

26:55.458 --> 26:57.083
- Who's asking?

26:57.125 --> 26:58.625
- Me.

26:58.667 --> 27:00.457
- Who are you?

27:00.458 --> 27:02.833
- I'm a friend of hers
from childhood.

27:02.875 --> 27:04.167
- Ah, you know her from Ohio.

27:04.168 --> 27:05.500
- Yeah.

27:05.542 --> 27:06.875
- She grew up in Texas, jerkoff.

27:06.917 --> 27:09.000
Look, just go away.

27:09.042 --> 27:10.167
- Does she still work here?

27:10.208 --> 27:11.625
I just want to talk to her,
okay?

27:11.626 --> 27:13.791
- Yeah, you and half of the guys
in the bar.

27:13.792 --> 27:16.250
Beat it before I beat you.

27:16.292 --> 27:18.167
- Wow, did you just
come up with that yourself?

27:22.792 --> 27:23.750
Whoa, Lucy!
Lucy!

27:23.792 --> 27:24.750
Lucy!

27:24.792 --> 27:25.750
- You know this guy?
- No.

27:25.792 --> 27:26.750
- Lucy, it's me!

27:26.792 --> 27:28.208
- Stay away from her!

27:47.417 --> 27:49.583
- Get out of here!

27:49.625 --> 27:51.000
- Okay.
- What?

27:51.042 --> 27:52.583
No, wait, wait!

27:52.625 --> 27:54.417
Not you.

28:01.250 --> 28:02.833
- What are you doing here?

28:05.458 --> 28:08.583
- I'm sorry about the...
you know.

28:08.625 --> 28:11.542
I just...

28:11.583 --> 28:13.583
I mean, I was a little
in shook when you...

28:17.958 --> 28:20.583
I mean, you tell a guy
something like that, it's...

28:25.417 --> 28:27.250
So you... you want to keep it?

28:29.167 --> 28:32.208
- Do I want to keep it?

28:32.250 --> 28:35.124
It's not a stray dog, you know.

28:35.125 --> 28:37.333
- No, I know.
I just... I'm just saying.

28:37.375 --> 28:39.457
- What?
What are you saying?

28:39.458 --> 28:43.208
I'm listening to you,
but you're not saying anything.

28:43.250 --> 28:45.375
If you don't want
to have the baby,

28:45.417 --> 28:48.124
I'll help out, you know,
with the money.

28:48.125 --> 28:51.500
- Gee, what a stand-up guy.

28:51.542 --> 28:53.041
- What do you want from me?

28:53.042 --> 28:54.333
- I don't want
anything from you.

28:54.334 --> 28:57.583
You came here
to see me, remember?

28:57.625 --> 29:01.417
- I don't know
why you want to have a baby.

29:01.458 --> 29:03.290
Why do you want to bring a baby
into this world

29:03.291 --> 29:05.708
with a shit father who doesn't
want anything to do with it

29:05.750 --> 29:07.583
and a mother who can't afford
to take care of it?

29:07.625 --> 29:09.667
I mean...

29:12.375 --> 29:15.332
I'm tryin' to help you out
here, okay?

29:15.333 --> 29:16.917
- You've already done enough.
Thanks.

29:16.958 --> 29:17.958
- I can't talk to you.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
You just want to get smart
all the time and walk away.

29:20.042 --> 29:21.040
- If I was smart,

29:21.041 --> 29:22.708
I wouldn't have talked to you
to begin with,

29:22.750 --> 29:23.833
and I just would have
walked away.

29:23.875 --> 29:25.333
- See, that's what
I'm talking about.

29:25.334 --> 29:27.500
I'm trying to do my part here,
okay?

29:30.917 --> 29:34.792
I want to find a good doctor,
and I want to pay for it.

29:37.708 --> 29:39.042
So what do you say?

29:40.958 --> 29:42.167
- I say you're an asshole.

29:47.042 --> 29:48.625
But I'll think about it.

29:51.542 --> 29:52.875
- Wait.

29:55.333 --> 29:57.167
How do I get ahold of you?

30:00.417 --> 30:02.167
- Call me here.

30:02.208 --> 30:04.417
I'm livin' out of Gomer's
back office.

30:15.458 --> 30:17.833
- How much?

30:17.875 --> 30:21.624
No, I don't have insurance.

30:21.625 --> 30:23.167
I don't want a free clinic okay?

30:23.208 --> 30:25.375
I want to pay for it.

30:25.417 --> 30:27.625
No, I realize that, but...

30:28.833 --> 30:30.583
Okay, well, what if I paid cash?

30:30.625 --> 30:32.250
I mean, can we work a deal
or something?

30:32.292 --> 30:34.000
Hello?
Hello?

30:43.958 --> 30:46.333
- I just came by
to get the rest of my things.

30:48.958 --> 30:50.625
Bobby, can you just
say something?

30:50.626 --> 30:52.499
- Or what?

30:52.500 --> 30:53.833
You gonna have your boyfriend
beat me up?

30:53.875 --> 30:57.125
- He's a good man.
He needs me.

30:58.125 --> 31:00.332
- What about me, Ma?

31:00.333 --> 31:03.000
I need you.

31:03.042 --> 31:04.832
- No, you don't.

31:04.833 --> 31:06.791
You're taking care of me.

31:06.792 --> 31:08.792
I don't want you
to have to take care of me.

31:08.833 --> 31:10.917
With Carl,
we take care of each other.

31:10.958 --> 31:12.166
- Oh, yeah?

31:12.167 --> 31:14.333
Is that the arrangement you made
with your bingo buddy?

31:14.334 --> 31:15.832
- I love him, Bobby.

31:15.833 --> 31:18.000
Not the way I loved your father

31:18.042 --> 31:20.417
and not the way I love you.

31:20.458 --> 31:21.458
It's a different love.

31:22.792 --> 31:24.583
Maybe someday
you'll meet somebody,

31:24.625 --> 31:27.457
and you'll understand.

31:27.458 --> 31:29.624
You'll know.

31:29.625 --> 31:31.667
I got to go.

31:31.708 --> 31:34.666
Look, he wants to invite you
to dinner tomorrow night.

31:34.667 --> 31:37.333
Start fresh.

31:37.375 --> 31:38.750
Here's the number.

31:41.292 --> 31:43.750
I'm happy, Bobby.

31:43.792 --> 31:45.292
Can't you be happy for me?

31:53.958 --> 31:56.875
- Hey.

31:56.917 --> 31:59.332
Turn the iron setting down.

31:59.333 --> 32:01.000
Don't burn all his shirts
like you do mine.

32:15.833 --> 32:18.208
Hey, Jax.

32:18.250 --> 32:19.708
No, no, I can't today.

32:19.750 --> 32:21.333
I got to take care
of some stuff.

32:23.708 --> 32:24.707
- Bobby.

32:24.708 --> 32:26.207
Bobby Corelli.

32:26.208 --> 32:27.957
That's you, right?

32:27.958 --> 32:29.957
- What?
- Is that your name?

32:29.958 --> 32:31.375
You live here?
- Who?

32:31.417 --> 32:32.375
- You, Bobby.

32:32.417 --> 32:33.375
- Me?
I'm Tommy.

32:33.417 --> 32:34.375
- Tommy.

32:34.417 --> 32:35.375
- Tommy.
I'm just...

32:35.417 --> 32:36.375
I was visiting my aunt.

32:36.417 --> 32:37.750
- You don't live here?
- No.

32:37.792 --> 32:39.165
- Hey, Bobby, how's it going?

32:39.166 --> 32:40.667
I hear your mother's
getting married.

32:40.708 --> 32:41.917
Congratulations.

32:57.625 --> 32:59.500
- They got me, Jax.

32:59.542 --> 33:00.542
They got me.

33:00.583 --> 33:02.208
I don't know how they got me,
but they got me.

33:02.250 --> 33:03.208
- Who?
Who got you?

33:03.250 --> 33:04.290
- The cops.
The cops got me.

33:04.291 --> 33:06.208
They were all over my apartment
like a bees' nest.

33:06.250 --> 33:07.208
How did they get my name?

33:07.250 --> 33:08.208
- I don't know.

33:08.250 --> 33:09.290
I have no idea how they know.

33:09.291 --> 33:11.290
Maybe it was your little
girlfriend ratted you out.

33:11.291 --> 33:12.623
- She doesn't know what I do.

33:12.624 --> 33:13.790
- They follow you here?

33:13.791 --> 33:15.083
- No.
- How do you know?

33:15.125 --> 33:16.708
- You're fine, okay?

33:18.292 --> 33:21.124
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

33:21.125 --> 33:22.123
I mean, I got to lay low.

33:22.124 --> 33:23.790
That's what I got to do.
Just got to lay low.

33:23.791 --> 33:25.125
- You find a place
to do that thing?

33:25.126 --> 33:27.124
- Yeah, Elmsview Hospital.

33:27.125 --> 33:29.000
I was born there,
so it must be good, right?

33:29.042 --> 33:31.750
- Must be terrific.
Look how you turned out.

33:31.792 --> 33:33.498
I need, like, a hundred bucks
or something.

33:33.499 --> 33:34.623
I got to stay at a motel.

33:34.624 --> 33:36.042
I got nowhere to go.
- Get out of here.

33:36.083 --> 33:38.042
- Give me a hundred bucks.
Where am I supposed to go?

33:38.083 --> 33:39.250
I don't got nothing, all right?

33:39.292 --> 33:40.583
Nothing for you.
- I'm not joking.

33:40.625 --> 33:41.583
I got nowhere to go.

33:41.625 --> 33:43.375
- No, I'm not gonna
give you nothing.

33:43.417 --> 33:44.458
- Are you kidding me?

33:46.750 --> 33:48.542
Prick!
You think I need you?

33:48.583 --> 33:50.167
I can just go pick
a couple of wallets.

33:50.208 --> 33:52.499
Hey, hey, hey,
you got 20 bucks?

33:52.500 --> 33:53.499
No?

33:53.500 --> 33:56.124
What is wrong with this kid?

33:56.125 --> 33:58.542
- Hey, Bobby.

33:58.583 --> 34:00.292
If I were you,
I'd stay off the subway.

34:00.293 --> 34:01.292
Take a taxi.

34:01.333 --> 34:02.667
- Yeah, thanks.

34:29.125 --> 34:32.291
Hey. Hey, Carl.
It's Bobby.

34:32.292 --> 34:34.875
Bobby, the guy
you punched in the face.

34:34.917 --> 34:39.042
Yeah, is...
is my mother there?

34:39.083 --> 34:40.498
She's asleep?
Okay.

34:40.500 --> 34:42.750
No, no, I didn't realize
what time it was.

34:42.792 --> 34:44.750
Just tell her I'll
see you guys tomorrow.

34:44.792 --> 34:46.791
Okay?
Yeah.

34:46.792 --> 34:47.875
No, I'm fine.

34:47.917 --> 34:49.667
Thanks, bye.

35:13.833 --> 35:15.499
Lucy

35:15.500 --> 35:16.583
Lucy.

35:20.042 --> 35:21.624
- Why are you whispering?

35:21.625 --> 35:23.333
If you're gonna pound
on the door like that,

35:23.334 --> 35:25.083
you might as well be screamin'.

35:25.125 --> 35:26.083
- I came to tell you

35:26.125 --> 35:29.042
that we have an appointment
tomorrow at 2:00,

35:29.083 --> 35:31.333
so if that works for you...

35:32.917 --> 35:35.375
- Well, uh...

35:35.417 --> 35:37.542
It's 3:00 in the morning, so...

35:37.583 --> 35:40.667
I'll see you in about 11 hours.

35:41.167 --> 35:42.666
Next time, try calling.

35:42.667 --> 35:44.500
Oh, wait, you don't do that.

35:46.792 --> 35:48.167
- I had a rough night.

35:48.208 --> 35:50.250
Maybe I can come in
for a second,

35:50.292 --> 35:51.292
for a drink or something.

35:51.333 --> 35:54.417
- In case you haven't noticed,
we're closed.

35:54.458 --> 35:55.875
- Can I just come in
for a minute,

35:55.917 --> 35:57.457
one minute?

35:57.458 --> 35:59.500
I...

35:59.542 --> 36:03.124
I have nowhere else to go.

36:03.125 --> 36:04.917
Please.

36:07.958 --> 36:08.958
- For a minute.

36:21.417 --> 36:23.957
- You got a cigarette?

36:23.958 --> 36:25.625
- Pregnant women don't smoke.

36:33.292 --> 36:34.667
You still want that drink?

36:34.668 --> 36:37.042
- Yeah.
Scotch, thanks.

36:43.167 --> 36:45.250
- You want to talk about it?

36:45.292 --> 36:46.583
- About what?

36:46.625 --> 36:48.750
About whatever's
got you worn slick.

36:50.708 --> 36:53.875
- Worn slick?
What is that, Texas slang?

36:54.833 --> 36:56.375
- How do you know
I'm from Texas?

36:56.417 --> 36:57.667
- I know a few things.

37:01.375 --> 37:04.375
- Then tell me,
Mr. Know-a-Few Things,

37:04.417 --> 37:05.708
what's got you pounding
on my door

37:05.750 --> 37:07.542
in the middle of the night?

37:14.583 --> 37:16.042
- I got evicted.

37:18.417 --> 37:20.833
- Okay.

37:35.458 --> 37:36.958
- Can I ask you a question?

37:41.667 --> 37:44.667
That Fred Flintstone guy
your boyfriend?

37:44.708 --> 37:46.624
- Why?
Are you jealous?

37:46.625 --> 37:49.375
- Curious.

37:49.417 --> 37:51.750
- No, he's not.

37:51.792 --> 37:53.791
I mean, he used to be.

37:53.792 --> 37:56.083
He, um...

37:56.125 --> 37:58.583
He just looks out for me now.

37:58.625 --> 38:01.583
Protective older brother.

38:01.625 --> 38:02.833
In fact, he'd probably kill you

38:02.875 --> 38:04.875
if he knew you were here
right now,

38:04.917 --> 38:08.667
especially if he knew you were
the one that knocked me up.

38:08.708 --> 38:10.208
- He knows about...

38:11.958 --> 38:13.375
- Yeah.

38:18.250 --> 38:19.791
Why are you so curious
about him?

38:19.792 --> 38:21.042
- I don't know.

38:21.083 --> 38:23.457
Just, you know,

38:23.458 --> 38:25.208
he's a lot different than me,
right?

38:25.250 --> 38:27.707
So I was just wondering,

38:27.708 --> 38:30.542
that night, you know, you...

38:30.583 --> 38:32.625
I mean, if that's the type
you like then why...

38:38.083 --> 38:39.583
Forget it.

38:40.833 --> 38:43.500
- You asking me why I went home
with you that night?

38:45.958 --> 38:47.333
- Yeah.

38:53.083 --> 38:55.375
- I've been asking myself that
every day for three months.

39:06.458 --> 39:08.375
It was your eyes.

39:08.417 --> 39:09.791
- My eyes?

39:09.792 --> 39:11.124
- Yeah.

39:11.125 --> 39:12.999
Yeah.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.208
I liked your eyes.

39:14.250 --> 39:16.750
You had really kind eyes.

39:17.750 --> 39:20.167
It kind of reminded me
of my father's.

39:20.208 --> 39:22.458
- So you went home with me
because I had nice eyes.

39:22.459 --> 39:23.708
- Kind eyes.

39:25.750 --> 39:29.542
Plus, you know,
I liked talking to you.

39:29.583 --> 39:32.167
I thought you were funny
and nice,

39:32.208 --> 39:34.917
and you had a great ass.

39:40.542 --> 39:42.875
I let you walk me home,
didn't I?

39:42.917 --> 39:44.667
- Yeah.

39:44.708 --> 39:46.166
Yeah.

39:46.167 --> 39:49.917
- And then when we
got to my apartment,

39:49.958 --> 39:51.500
you didn't even try anything.

39:51.542 --> 39:57.291
You just smiled and thanked me
for a great time

39:57.292 --> 39:58.457
and said...

39:58.458 --> 39:59.500
- "Good night."

40:03.292 --> 40:04.250
- And I don't know;

40:04.292 --> 40:08.000
I guess I just didn't want
the night to end.

40:11.667 --> 40:16.042
But looking back, I should've
ended it a lot sooner,

40:16.083 --> 40:19.000
about three minutes sooner,
if I remember correctly.

40:20.833 --> 40:22.917
Speaking of minutes,

40:22.958 --> 40:24.458
yours is up.

40:28.083 --> 40:30.458
Look, I got a big day tomorrow,
so, you know.

40:32.208 --> 40:34.375
And, listen, you don't, um...

40:34.417 --> 40:35.456
You don't have to go with me.

40:35.457 --> 40:37.000
You know, you can just
drop the money off

40:37.042 --> 40:38.956
and tell me where to go
in the morning.

40:38.957 --> 40:40.625
- I told you I was taking you
to a good doctor,

40:40.626 --> 40:42.167
and I'm taking you, okay?

40:42.208 --> 40:45.500
And that means
taking you personally.

40:45.542 --> 40:47.124
- Well, you don't have to.

40:47.125 --> 40:49.833
- Well, I am.

40:49.875 --> 40:52.750
So we'll meet at a 1:45?

40:52.792 --> 40:54.542
It's on 39th street
and 5th avenue.

40:54.583 --> 40:55.917
It's called Elmsview, okay?

40:55.958 --> 40:57.083
- Yeah, okay, fine.

41:06.458 --> 41:08.875
- I'll see you tomorrow.
Thanks for the drink.

42:35.750 --> 42:37.167
You got a cigarette?

43:05.500 --> 43:06.499
Hey, Lucy.

43:06.500 --> 43:09.708
It's Bobby.
I got a problem.

43:09.750 --> 43:12.083
- So let me get this straight.

43:12.125 --> 43:14.457
The money is in your apartment,

43:14.458 --> 43:16.500
but you want me to go get it.

43:16.542 --> 43:17.875
- That's right.

43:17.917 --> 43:19.623
- Because if your landlord
sees you,

43:19.624 --> 43:20.667
he'll call the cops

43:20.708 --> 43:22.292
on account that you owe him
rent money.

43:22.293 --> 43:25.167
- That's right.

43:25.208 --> 43:27.833
- So you want me sneak
into your apartment

43:27.875 --> 43:28.873
and get the money,

43:28.874 --> 43:29.998
and if anyone sees me,

43:29.999 --> 43:31.667
I'm supposed to say
I'm the cleaning lady?

43:31.668 --> 43:34.332
- That's right.
- Oh, hmm. Yeah.

43:34.333 --> 43:36.083
And none of this sounds fishy
to you?

43:38.375 --> 43:40.000
- Okay, you're right.
That sounds stupid.

43:40.042 --> 43:41.625
Just, uh...

43:41.667 --> 43:43.375
Okay, tell them
you're visiting your aunt.

43:43.417 --> 43:44.583
- No, wait, I already used that.

43:44.625 --> 43:46.625
Oh, just go with
the cleaning lady, okay?

43:46.667 --> 43:47.875
That'll work.

43:47.917 --> 43:50.332
Just tell them
you're the cleaning lady, okay?

43:50.333 --> 43:51.833
And if anybody asks,
you don't know me,

43:51.875 --> 43:53.290
and you don't know where I am.

43:53.291 --> 43:55.500
- Well, if I don't know you,
how would I know where you are?

43:55.501 --> 43:56.917
- Exactly.

43:56.958 --> 43:59.291
- Why don't you try
telling me the truth?

43:59.292 --> 44:00.624
- I told you, okay?

44:00.625 --> 44:01.708
That's my apartment.

44:01.750 --> 44:03.999
These are my keys,
and it's my money.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.417
Now, if I could
get the money myself,

44:05.458 --> 44:06.832
I would, but I can't.

44:06.833 --> 44:08.833
So, you know, if you don't
want to do it, that's fine,

44:08.834 --> 44:10.667
but I don't have the money,
so...

44:34.625 --> 44:36.624
- Jeez.

44:36.625 --> 44:38.833
This place really
could use a cleaning lady.

46:08.500 --> 46:11.000
- Did you get it?

46:11.042 --> 46:13.542
Good job.

46:26.292 --> 46:27.291
Hey.

46:27.292 --> 46:29.457
- All girls are evil.

46:29.458 --> 46:30.500
- Not a good time, man.

46:30.542 --> 46:33.332
I'm on the way
to do that thing.

46:33.333 --> 46:34.832
- Oh, yeah.

46:34.833 --> 46:37.332
Let me know
how it all comes out.

46:37.333 --> 46:38.542
- Funny.

46:39.958 --> 46:42.167
- Did you tell the whole world?

46:53.750 --> 46:55.792
- How much?
- $18, please.

47:04.125 --> 47:05.958
- Watch it, jackass.

47:16.667 --> 47:17.666
- Hi.

47:17.667 --> 47:18.667
My name's Lucy Atwood.

47:18.668 --> 47:20.124
I have an appointment.

47:20.125 --> 47:21.167
- What time?

47:21.208 --> 47:22.917
- Right now, actually.

47:27.292 --> 47:28.291
Thank you.

47:28.292 --> 47:29.292
- Please fill this out.

47:29.293 --> 47:32.792
- Okay.

47:32.833 --> 47:35.042
Just my driver's license
and social security?

47:35.083 --> 47:36.167
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

47:41.292 --> 47:42.708
- Hey.
- Hey.

47:42.750 --> 47:43.833
- What's the matter?

47:43.875 --> 47:45.583
- Um...

47:45.625 --> 47:47.832
I don't know... I don't know
if I can do this.

47:47.833 --> 47:50.624
- Well, technically,
you don't have to do anything.

47:50.625 --> 47:51.667
I'm the one that's gotta do.

47:51.708 --> 47:53.083
You already did.

47:58.167 --> 47:59.832
- No, I mean...

47:59.833 --> 48:03.708
you know, maybe...
maybe we should wait.

48:03.750 --> 48:05.292
- Wait?
- Yeah.

48:05.333 --> 48:07.167
- What, you think if I go home
and take two aspirin,

48:07.208 --> 48:09.000
it might go away?

48:16.542 --> 48:18.708
- I'm just sayin',
you know, maybe...

48:18.750 --> 48:20.000
- No, Bobby.

48:20.042 --> 48:21.999
You don't get to do this, okay?

48:22.000 --> 48:24.666
Now, I have been over this
back and forth several times

48:24.667 --> 48:26.667
and you made it pretty clear
yesterday how you felt.

48:26.668 --> 48:28.667
So let's just get it over with.

48:33.125 --> 48:34.333
- I think we should wait.

48:36.208 --> 48:37.417
- You... you think we should wait?

48:37.458 --> 48:39.208
- Yeah.

48:39.250 --> 48:41.291
- You think we should wait?

48:41.292 --> 48:42.292
I think you're an asshole.

48:42.293 --> 48:44.624
- Ow!
What'd you do that for?

48:44.625 --> 48:46.250
- God, I hate you.
- Stop it.

48:46.292 --> 48:47.792
- I hate you I hate you!

48:47.833 --> 48:49.250
Give me the money.
I'll do it myself.

48:49.292 --> 48:50.833
We'll figure it out.
- Where'd you put it?

48:50.875 --> 48:52.500
We'll figure it out.
Will you just calm down, please?

48:52.542 --> 48:54.000
Would you just calm down?

48:54.042 --> 48:56.250
- I hate you I hate you!

48:56.292 --> 48:57.500
Just give me the money.

49:05.542 --> 49:08.833
- Lucy, I need you to trust me
right now.

49:11.667 --> 49:12.666
Run.

49:12.667 --> 49:13.667
- What?

49:15.833 --> 49:17.499
- Run.

50:08.292 --> 50:09.500
- Come on.

50:09.542 --> 50:11.417
- No.

50:11.458 --> 50:14.958
- Taxi!

50:15.000 --> 50:17.125
Go. Go.

50:19.292 --> 50:20.917
- Thanks.

50:42.375 --> 50:43.624
- Hey, Bob.

50:43.625 --> 50:44.667
You're a little early.

50:44.708 --> 50:47.166
I told your ma dinner,
not lunch, right?

50:47.167 --> 50:49.875
- Well, we were... we were
in the neighborhood, so...

50:49.917 --> 50:51.333
- Oh, well, yeah.

50:51.375 --> 50:52.417
Come on in.
Hi.

50:52.458 --> 50:53.458
- Hi.

50:56.292 --> 50:58.791
- Yeah, I was actually
just going for the groceries

50:58.792 --> 51:00.542
for your ma.

51:00.583 --> 51:01.542
She, uh...

51:01.583 --> 51:03.250
She gave me a list
and everything.

51:03.292 --> 51:04.667
- My mom's not here?

51:07.333 --> 51:10.042
I get to watch them once a week
for my daughter.

51:10.083 --> 51:11.208
They're cute little bastards.

51:11.250 --> 51:14.167
They're twins.

51:14.208 --> 51:16.167
So you're Bobby's girl, huh?

51:16.208 --> 51:17.417
- No. No.
- No.

51:17.458 --> 51:19.332
- No?

51:19.333 --> 51:20.790
All right, well, then I, uh...

51:20.791 --> 51:22.083
I got to get to the store.

51:22.125 --> 51:23.500
You... I don't know,
you want to come?

51:23.542 --> 51:24.500
- No.
- No.

51:24.542 --> 51:25.500
- No?
You want to stay?

51:25.542 --> 51:27.957
- Yeah, no, we'll just wait
for my mom.

51:27.958 --> 51:29.333
- All right.

51:29.375 --> 51:30.833
Oh.

51:30.875 --> 51:33.250
Gee, Bob, I'm sorry.

51:33.292 --> 51:34.500
Look, um...

51:34.542 --> 51:36.791
I love your mother,
and I'm very protective;

51:36.792 --> 51:37.791
That's all.

51:37.792 --> 51:39.000
- Me too.

51:40.417 --> 51:42.250
Smarmy asshole.

51:43.750 --> 51:44.875
- Spill it.

51:44.917 --> 51:47.167
- What?
What do you want to know?

51:47.208 --> 51:48.750
- What do I want to know?

51:48.792 --> 51:52.208
Uh, gee, why have we been chased
by the cops?

51:52.250 --> 51:54.125
What kind of trouble
did you get me into?

51:54.126 --> 51:55.250
Who's Carl?

51:55.292 --> 51:56.542
And who the hell are you?

51:56.583 --> 51:58.083
- Carl is my mother's
boyfriend.

51:58.125 --> 51:59.791
She just moved in here
with him.

51:59.792 --> 52:02.124
- Right.
And the cops?

52:02.125 --> 52:04.250
- I don't exactly work
on Wall Street.

52:04.292 --> 52:05.792
- Mm-hmm.

52:06.625 --> 52:08.625
So I can rule out
insider trading.

52:19.208 --> 52:20.625
- I'm a pickpocket.

52:25.208 --> 52:26.999
- What's so funny?

52:27.000 --> 52:29.332
- A pickpocket?

52:29.333 --> 52:31.332
And that's why half
the New York police force

52:31.333 --> 52:32.499
is after you?

52:32.500 --> 52:34.458
- You heard about the cop
who got his badge picked?

52:48.875 --> 52:50.957
- Oh, wow.

52:50.958 --> 52:52.417
This is great.

52:52.458 --> 52:53.791
Really.

52:53.792 --> 52:56.999
My kid's father steals
out of old ladies' handbags.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
- Hey, I never took from anybody

52:59.042 --> 53:00.917
who looked like
they had less than me, okay?

53:00.958 --> 53:02.667
- Oh, you're a regular
Robin Hood.

53:02.668 --> 53:05.250
- You know, you don't know
my situation.

53:05.292 --> 53:06.666
- Yeah, you're right.

53:06.667 --> 53:07.956
I don't know you at all.

53:07.957 --> 53:09.331
- What are you talking about?

53:09.332 --> 53:11.167
I'm the same guy you met
that night at the bar,

53:11.208 --> 53:13.499
except I have a different job
than you thought.

53:13.500 --> 53:15.332
- Are you insane?

53:15.333 --> 53:16.917
That's not a job, Bobby.

53:16.958 --> 53:17.917
You steal.

53:17.958 --> 53:19.291
- Okay, don't do that.

53:19.292 --> 53:20.498
Don't... don't judge me.

53:20.499 --> 53:22.917
My father left me with 500 grand
in gambling debts

53:22.958 --> 53:24.250
and a mother who didn't work.

53:24.292 --> 53:25.292
I had no choice.

53:29.958 --> 53:32.667
- Why didn't you just
go to the cops?

53:32.708 --> 53:34.667
- Because he threatened
to kill my mother.

53:37.542 --> 53:42.208
- Why do you steal now?

53:42.250 --> 53:44.167
- I still owe him about 100K.

53:46.708 --> 53:47.875
- Oh.

53:49.292 --> 53:50.792
- Oh, come on,
what... what are you doing?

53:50.833 --> 53:52.333
- I'm taking the money.

53:52.375 --> 53:54.083
I'm not bringing a kid
into this world

53:54.125 --> 53:55.417
so they can go visit
their father

53:55.458 --> 53:57.125
at the state pen
during Christmas.

54:01.750 --> 54:03.417
Where'd you put it?

54:03.458 --> 54:05.708
- It's in the jacket.

54:05.750 --> 54:08.166
- No, it's not.

54:08.167 --> 54:09.667
- What are you talking about?

54:10.375 --> 54:13.457
- It's not in here.

54:13.458 --> 54:14.456
- What did you do with it?

54:14.457 --> 54:15.456
Did you lose it?

54:15.457 --> 54:16.665
- What do you mean,
did I lose it?

54:16.666 --> 54:17.792
It was in your jacket.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.583
You took it, remember?
- I didn't take it.

54:21.625 --> 54:23.125
You grabbed my arms
and kissed me, remember?

54:31.500 --> 54:33.124
Maybe it fell out in the cab.

54:33.125 --> 54:36.333
Or when that guy
bumped into you or something.

54:43.875 --> 54:45.666
Oh, that's classic.

54:45.667 --> 54:48.167
A pickpocket who gets
pickpocketed.

54:50.958 --> 54:52.957
Jesus.

54:52.958 --> 54:54.917
- Reach for the sky

54:54.958 --> 54:57.333
and empty out your pockets,
Mister.

54:57.375 --> 54:58.333
- Too late for that.

54:58.375 --> 55:00.500
- Bobby.
You're early.

55:00.542 --> 55:01.667
Where's Carl?

55:01.708 --> 55:02.791
- Store.

55:02.792 --> 55:04.792
- Go play with your little
furry friends.

55:04.833 --> 55:07.333
Hi.
I'm Bobby's mother, Rita.

55:07.375 --> 55:08.417
- I'm Lucy.

55:10.958 --> 55:12.291
- Wow.

55:12.292 --> 55:13.500
I can't remember the last time

55:13.542 --> 55:14.956
Bobby brought a girl home
to meet me.

55:14.957 --> 55:16.000
- You must be...

55:16.042 --> 55:18.000
- Leaving, Mom.
She was just leaving.

55:18.042 --> 55:19.000
She's just a friend.

55:19.042 --> 55:21.000
Listen, uh...
I'll... I'll come by later.

55:21.042 --> 55:22.123
We'll talk about the thing.

55:22.124 --> 55:23.333
- Wait, wait.
Don't be so rude.

55:23.334 --> 55:25.500
Maybe she'd like
to stay for dinner.

55:25.542 --> 55:27.875
I'm gonna make some lasagna.

55:27.917 --> 55:30.417
It's Bobby's favorite.

55:30.458 --> 55:32.124
- Mmm.
Yummy.

55:32.125 --> 55:33.250
I'd love to.

55:33.292 --> 55:34.250
- Yeah?
Great.

55:34.292 --> 55:35.250
I'll go start.

55:35.292 --> 55:37.042
Okay.
I'll help.

55:37.083 --> 55:39.750
- You that hungry?
- I am eating for two.

55:39.792 --> 55:42.792
- Just don't say anything
to my mother.

55:42.833 --> 55:45.792
- Oh, now why would I want
to upset Grammie?

55:52.042 --> 55:54.625
- Hey, Mister, do you want
to play a board game?

55:54.667 --> 55:56.042
- No.

55:56.083 --> 55:57.125
- A video game?

55:57.167 --> 55:58.167
- No.

55:58.208 --> 56:00.750
- How about cops and robbers?

56:01.792 --> 56:02.792
- Definitely no.

56:16.167 --> 56:17.833
- So how do you know my Bobby?

56:19.667 --> 56:21.499
- We, um...

56:21.500 --> 56:22.875
We have a mutual friend.

56:22.917 --> 56:24.167
- Ah.

56:27.792 --> 56:31.333
You know, I think Bobby
really likes you.

56:31.375 --> 56:32.833
- What makes you say that?

56:32.875 --> 56:34.292
- Well, he always gets
so frustrated

56:34.293 --> 56:36.250
around girls he really likes.

56:36.292 --> 56:39.375
It's like he doesn't want to
show them he cares about them.

56:39.417 --> 56:41.291
You know how boys are.

56:41.292 --> 56:43.875
Always pullin' the pigtails
of the girls they like.

56:46.708 --> 56:48.083
- Crap?
- It's called craps.

56:48.125 --> 56:49.375
That's the name of the game,
okay?

56:49.417 --> 56:50.375
It's a very serious game.

56:50.417 --> 56:52.791
7 and 11 on the first roll wins.

56:52.792 --> 56:54.667
2, 3, 12 loses
on the first throw.

56:54.668 --> 56:58.042
After that, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10,
that becomes your point.

56:58.083 --> 56:59.292
You got to hit your point
to win.

56:59.293 --> 57:01.875
If you hit a 7 after that,
then you crap out, all right?

57:01.917 --> 57:02.875
Nicky, you go first.

57:02.917 --> 57:03.875
No, no, no, wait.

57:03.917 --> 57:05.083
We have to place our bets, okay?

57:05.125 --> 57:06.083
Place your bets, boys!

57:06.125 --> 57:07.083
There you go.

57:07.125 --> 57:08.999
Roll the dice.

57:09.000 --> 57:09.999
All right, 4.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.250
That's what we call Little Joe,
okay?

57:12.292 --> 57:13.708
So now you got to hit
Little Joe to win.

57:13.750 --> 57:15.623
Now, you can have fun with it.
Blow into the dice.

57:15.624 --> 57:17.208
Come on, Little Joe!
Come on, Little Joe!

57:17.250 --> 57:19.125
- Come on, Little Joe!
Come on, Little Joe!

57:22.125 --> 57:23.083
I win!

57:23.125 --> 57:24.167
- No, no, no, you lose.

57:24.208 --> 57:25.290
That's a... that's a crap out.

57:25.291 --> 57:26.292
We get your candy.

57:26.293 --> 57:28.833
See what happens
when you gamble?

57:28.875 --> 57:30.083
All right, now you play.

57:30.125 --> 57:31.124
- Hey, lady.

57:31.125 --> 57:33.750
You want a piece of the action?

57:33.792 --> 57:36.291
- No, I've had enough action
for one day.

57:36.292 --> 57:37.291
Thank you.

57:37.292 --> 57:38.333
- Okay.

57:38.375 --> 57:41.832
Rita, I got the fresh <i>pomodoro.</i>

57:41.833 --> 57:44.417
- She's in the kitchen.
I'll help you.

57:44.458 --> 57:45.958
- No, no, I got it.

57:46.000 --> 57:49.250
Besides, <i>mi casa su casa.</i>

57:49.292 --> 57:50.667
And I got an excuse now

57:50.708 --> 57:54.000
to go see the most
beautiful girl in the world.

57:54.042 --> 57:55.000
Hey, baby.

57:55.042 --> 57:58.667
- Jesus' name we pray.
- Amen.

57:58.708 --> 58:00.250
- Amen.

58:00.292 --> 58:01.875
- Amen.

58:07.042 --> 58:11.375
- So, Bob, Rita tells me
you work in stocks.

58:11.417 --> 58:12.957
- Yep.

58:12.958 --> 58:16.667
- And how's that going for you?

58:16.708 --> 58:19.166
- It's got its ups and downs.

58:19.167 --> 58:20.750
- Actually, weren't you just
telling me

58:20.792 --> 58:23.000
you were having trouble
paying your rent lately?

58:29.083 --> 58:31.124
- Well, if you're ever looking
for a steady gig,

58:31.125 --> 58:32.167
you can come down and see me.

58:32.208 --> 58:33.667
Give me a call.

58:33.708 --> 58:35.375
- Carl owns
a jewelry store downtown.

58:35.417 --> 58:38.208
- Diamonds are a girl's
best friend, right, Grampie?

58:38.250 --> 58:39.499
- Yep. And?

58:39.500 --> 58:41.417
- Don't buy retail.

58:41.458 --> 58:43.791
- Well, I'll keep it in mind.

58:43.792 --> 58:45.375
- And If you know anybody

58:45.417 --> 58:48.457
who's looking
for a nice engagement ring,

58:48.458 --> 58:49.500
tell Carl.

58:53.792 --> 58:55.250
He'll give you a good price.

58:55.292 --> 58:57.457
- Thanks, Mom.

58:57.458 --> 59:00.167
- Lucy's a professional
photographer.

59:00.208 --> 59:01.583
- Oh, no.

59:01.625 --> 59:03.833
- Is that right?

59:03.875 --> 59:05.957
- Mostly freelance.

59:05.958 --> 59:08.332
But right now, I'm working
in a bar part-time.

59:08.333 --> 59:09.958
You know, it's not much,

59:10.000 --> 59:12.667
but at least
it's an honest living.

59:14.208 --> 59:15.167
- You're right about that.

59:15.208 --> 59:17.083
Rita said you were from Texas.

59:17.125 --> 59:18.624
- Mm-hmm.

59:18.625 --> 59:20.500
Yeah, I'm actually
heading back this Saturday.

59:20.542 --> 59:22.499
- Wow, that's too bad.

59:22.500 --> 59:24.333
Yeah, I think I'm gonna,
you know,

59:24.375 --> 59:26.166
move back in with my sister,

59:26.167 --> 59:27.165
you know, work at a...

59:27.166 --> 59:28.958
at a photography studio
shooting portraits.

59:28.959 --> 59:31.000
That sort of thing.

59:35.583 --> 59:38.000
- And you were planning
on telling me when?

59:38.042 --> 59:41.333
- Well, I wasn't really planning
anything with you.

59:43.625 --> 59:44.667
- How's the lasagna?

59:44.708 --> 59:46.499
- It's delicious.

59:46.500 --> 59:47.500
- Wonderful.

59:51.292 --> 59:52.291
Excuse me.

59:52.292 --> 59:53.667
- Do you need to use
the ladies' room?

59:53.708 --> 59:54.791
- No.

59:54.792 --> 59:56.292
- We don't got a ladies' room.

59:56.333 --> 59:57.500
Grampie's only got a bathroom.

59:59.250 --> 01:00:02.000
- Lucy, are you okay?

01:00:02.042 --> 01:00:03.000
What's the matter?

01:00:03.042 --> 01:00:04.000
Hey, hey!

01:00:04.042 --> 01:00:05.167
- Call 911!
- Breathe.

01:00:07.125 --> 01:00:09.167
- I'm not going into labor,
you moron.

01:00:09.208 --> 01:00:10.957
I'm only three months pregnant!

01:00:10.958 --> 01:00:12.167
- Bobby!

01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:14.417
- Ma...

01:00:14.458 --> 01:00:16.458
Oh, shit.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.917
- Why didn't you tell me, Bobby?

01:00:23.958 --> 01:00:25.667
- I didn't want
to worry you, Ma.

01:00:25.708 --> 01:00:27.000
- What worry me?

01:00:27.001 --> 01:00:29.333
Why would havin'
a grandkid worry me?

01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:32.958
Does she want to keep it?

01:00:35.583 --> 01:00:36.625
- I don't know.

01:00:39.625 --> 01:00:40.625
- Do you love her?

01:00:45.542 --> 01:00:46.500
- I don't know, Mom.

01:00:46.542 --> 01:00:50.250
I mean, I don't know
what love is.

01:00:50.292 --> 01:00:52.957
How do you...
how do you know?

01:00:52.958 --> 01:00:55.000
- Well, when she said
she was leaving on Saturday,

01:00:55.042 --> 01:00:57.499
how'd that make you feel?

01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.750
- Sick.

01:00:59.792 --> 01:01:01.456
- And when we were on our way
to the hospital,

01:01:01.457 --> 01:01:02.750
how did you feel?

01:01:05.417 --> 01:01:07.708
Sometimes it takes
almost losing what we have

01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:09.792
to make us realize
how lucky we are to have it.

01:01:12.792 --> 01:01:13.792
Dr. Phil.

01:01:17.792 --> 01:01:19.250
I'm gonna get going.

01:01:19.292 --> 01:01:20.833
I'll leave you two alone.

01:01:42.792 --> 01:01:45.124
- Hey.

01:01:45.125 --> 01:01:46.667
- Hi.

01:01:49.958 --> 01:01:52.333
- The doctors said
you're gonna be okay.

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:54.583
They said you just need to rest.

01:01:56.958 --> 01:01:58.167
- What about the baby?

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:00.833
- The baby's gonna be okay.

01:02:04.458 --> 01:02:05.666
What?

01:02:05.667 --> 01:02:08.000
Hey. Don't worry.
The baby's gonna be okay.

01:02:08.042 --> 01:02:10.291
You're gonna be fine.

01:02:10.292 --> 01:02:12.292
- I just thought it would
take care of itself.

01:02:16.375 --> 01:02:18.624
I just... I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

01:02:18.625 --> 01:02:21.375
- Hey, listen,
what we're gonna do.

01:02:21.417 --> 01:02:24.167
It's not just you any more.
It's us.

01:02:24.208 --> 01:02:25.667
Right?

01:02:25.708 --> 01:02:28.417
- Come on, Bobby.

01:02:28.458 --> 01:02:30.832
You don't want to have a kid.

01:02:30.833 --> 01:02:31.958
We barely know each other.

01:02:31.959 --> 01:02:34.291
I mean, you couldn't even
remember my name

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:35.667
a few a days ago.

01:02:39.125 --> 01:02:41.499
- Is that what you think?

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:44.625
That I couldn't remember
your name?

01:02:46.292 --> 01:02:48.417
You want to know the truth?

01:02:48.458 --> 01:02:51.333
- Yeah, the truth would be nice
for once.

01:02:53.417 --> 01:02:56.166
- Okay.

01:02:56.167 --> 01:02:59.332
Okay. Fine.

01:02:59.333 --> 01:03:01.166
After that night,

01:03:01.167 --> 01:03:05.333
I couldn't stop
thinking about you.

01:03:05.375 --> 01:03:08.417
I thought about you so much,
I was going nuts.

01:03:08.458 --> 01:03:09.958
I mean, I finally had you
out of my head,

01:03:09.959 --> 01:03:12.417
and then there you were
right in front of me.

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:18.291
I got so nervous,
I couldn't even talk.

01:03:18.292 --> 01:03:19.667
- Why didn't you call me?

01:03:21.625 --> 01:03:24.333
- I was scared.

01:03:24.375 --> 01:03:27.500
When I woke up that morning,

01:03:27.542 --> 01:03:31.291
I looked over,
and you were so beautiful.

01:03:31.292 --> 01:03:35.166
You're so beautiful.

01:03:35.167 --> 01:03:38.499
First time
I didn't want to leave.

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:41.708
That's never happened
to me before.

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:43.417
I went to write down
my real number

01:03:43.458 --> 01:03:44.667
on a piece of paper,
and then I...

01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:46.833
I crumpled it up,

01:03:46.875 --> 01:03:48.167
and I wrote
a fake number instead.

01:03:48.208 --> 01:03:51.167
Then I... then I wrote
my real number down.

01:03:51.208 --> 01:03:53.000
I crumpled that up,
and, I don't know,

01:03:53.042 --> 01:03:55.375
I must have gone back and forth
and done that, like, ten times.

01:03:55.417 --> 01:03:57.542
And then I finally took all
the crumpled pieces of paper,

01:03:57.583 --> 01:03:58.790
and I put it in my pocket,

01:03:58.791 --> 01:04:00.000
and when I went to leave,

01:04:00.042 --> 01:04:01.750
I picked one out,
and I thought,

01:04:01.792 --> 01:04:03.165
"Hey, if this is
the real number,

01:04:03.166 --> 01:04:04.375
then it's meant to be."

01:04:06.125 --> 01:04:08.000
I kind of let fate decide,
you know?

01:04:10.375 --> 01:04:12.957
I know.

01:04:12.958 --> 01:04:14.957
I'm an asshole.

01:04:14.958 --> 01:04:16.083
It was stupid.

01:04:16.125 --> 01:04:18.083
I regretted it, but...

01:04:20.125 --> 01:04:23.042
I didn't forget your name, Lucy.

01:04:23.083 --> 01:04:24.542
I couldn't.

01:04:24.583 --> 01:04:26.500
I tried.
Believe me.

01:04:27.333 --> 01:04:29.292
- Why should I believe you?

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.958
- I been carrying around that
for three months.

01:04:42.959 --> 01:04:45.957
I have problems
with commitment.

01:04:45.958 --> 01:04:48.250
- Yeah, I know.

01:04:48.292 --> 01:04:50.500
You can't even commit
to a brand of cigarettes.

01:04:54.708 --> 01:04:58.791
- I'm not gonna run away
from this, okay?

01:04:58.792 --> 01:05:00.125
That's my commitment to you.

01:05:01.792 --> 01:05:04.833
- I can't be with someone
who steals from people.

01:05:04.875 --> 01:05:05.917
- Then I'm done.

01:05:05.958 --> 01:05:08.333
I'll quit.

01:05:08.375 --> 01:05:10.750
Give me a chance, okay?
I'll prove it to you.

01:05:10.792 --> 01:05:12.624
Just give me a chance.

01:05:12.625 --> 01:05:13.917
- And you'll quit?

01:05:13.958 --> 01:05:16.208
You can quit just like that'?

01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:18.000
For me?

01:05:23.583 --> 01:05:25.833
Okay.

01:05:32.958 --> 01:05:34.833
- Hey, hey, you guys.

01:05:34.875 --> 01:05:36.124
Get a room.

01:05:36.125 --> 01:05:39.958
Visiting hours are over,
and you need your rest.

01:07:53.917 --> 01:07:55.833
- You're in with the cops, Jax?

01:08:00.667 --> 01:08:03.000
You're in with the cops?
You?

01:08:03.042 --> 01:08:04.457
- Shut up!

01:08:04.458 --> 01:08:05.665
I should kill you right now.

01:08:05.666 --> 01:08:07.542
- Why would you sell me out
like that?

01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:08.875
- We ain't friends!

01:08:08.917 --> 01:08:10.667
- I gave up my life, Jax!

01:08:10.708 --> 01:08:12.583
Leave up my life!

01:08:12.625 --> 01:08:14.291
- We are not friends!

01:08:14.292 --> 01:08:16.707
Don't mess with my business!

01:08:18.250 --> 01:08:20.957
Steal a cop's badge?

01:08:24.292 --> 01:08:27.124
Those cops came barging
into my house!

01:08:27.125 --> 01:08:28.624
My house!

01:08:28.625 --> 01:08:29.792
- You work for me now.

01:08:30.875 --> 01:08:32.667
What, is that
supposed to be funny?

01:08:32.707 --> 01:08:34.999
I told them where you live.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
I told them where you'd be
and when you'd be there.

01:08:38.042 --> 01:08:39.332
- You had that guy
steal my money.

01:08:39.375 --> 01:08:40.624
- Yeah, I did.

01:08:40.625 --> 01:08:42.250
I figured you'd have
some money on you.

01:08:42.292 --> 01:08:43.332
Mr. Morality.

01:08:43.375 --> 01:08:46.166
He's gotta pay for all that shit
with his girlfriend.

01:08:46.167 --> 01:08:47.667
She couldn't chip in nothing.

01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:50.375
That friend did me a favor.

01:08:50.417 --> 01:08:51.707
That friend ratted me out.

01:08:52.707 --> 01:08:54.124
- Give me a name!

01:08:54.125 --> 01:08:55.375
- Jax.

01:08:55.417 --> 01:08:56.957
- Did I get mad at him?

01:08:56.957 --> 01:08:58.707
No.

01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:01.124
You know why?

01:09:01.125 --> 01:09:03.125
Because it's business, Bobby.

01:09:03.167 --> 01:09:04.917
Business.

01:09:04.957 --> 01:09:06.457
It's not personal.

01:09:10.957 --> 01:09:13.042
It's over.

01:09:17.707 --> 01:09:19.457
- Wait.
Wait.

01:09:19.457 --> 01:09:20.457
Listen.

01:09:20.457 --> 01:09:21.456
- Detective Sullivan.

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:22.956
- What if I could get you
your 50 grand back

01:09:22.957 --> 01:09:23.957
and everything I owe you?

01:09:23.959 --> 01:09:25.666
- It's too late.

01:09:25.667 --> 01:09:27.542
Okay, okay, you know what?
Call the cops.

01:09:27.582 --> 01:09:28.790
Call the cops, Jax.

01:09:28.791 --> 01:09:29.790
They got nothing on me.

01:09:29.791 --> 01:09:30.956
Look, I don't have the badge.

01:09:30.957 --> 01:09:33.125
You and I both know, without
that badge they got nothing.

01:09:33.126 --> 01:09:35.124
- Lock the door!
- Nothing.

01:09:35.125 --> 01:09:36.082
- This game is over now.

01:09:36.125 --> 01:09:39.125
- I got a score we could pull
that'll get you so much money,

01:09:39.167 --> 01:09:40.625
you won't have to
nickel... and... dime any more.

01:09:42.792 --> 01:09:45.500
You like diamonds?

01:09:45.542 --> 01:09:46.917
- I'm listening.

01:09:46.957 --> 01:09:48.624
It better be good.

01:09:48.625 --> 01:09:50.000
- I'm gonna get you
some diamonds.

01:09:55.792 --> 01:09:58.499
- Bobby?
- Oh, hey.

01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:01.332
- Hi.

01:10:01.333 --> 01:10:03.042
- How you feeling?

01:10:03.083 --> 01:10:05.208
- I'm a lot better.

01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:07.666
They said I can probably
go home this afternoon.

01:10:07.667 --> 01:10:08.875
You know, they're just waiting

01:10:08.917 --> 01:10:12.458
on a few more test results
to make sure.

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.208
You okay?

01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:16.792
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

01:10:19.792 --> 01:10:20.750
- Are those for me?

01:10:20.792 --> 01:10:22.667
- Oh, yeah.

01:10:22.708 --> 01:10:24.542
Sorry.
- Thank you.

01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:32.333
- Listen, Lucy,
I know I said yesterday

01:10:32.375 --> 01:10:34.167
that I could quit, but...

01:10:35.792 --> 01:10:37.000
Well, something kind of came up,

01:10:37.042 --> 01:10:40.375
and I got to do this...
this one last thing.

01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:43.292
- What are you talking about?

01:10:45.625 --> 01:10:49.333
- It's just... it's just
a little complicated.

01:10:49.375 --> 01:10:51.124
I just need you to trust me.

01:10:51.125 --> 01:10:52.750
I mean, the whole reason
why I'm telling you any of this

01:10:52.792 --> 01:10:54.791
is because I want to be honest
with you.

01:10:54.792 --> 01:10:56.208
- Be honest with me?

01:10:56.250 --> 01:10:58.250
You haven't told me anything.

01:10:58.292 --> 01:10:59.250
- I know.

01:10:59.292 --> 01:11:01.750
I... look, I can't.

01:11:01.792 --> 01:11:03.583
I wish I could, but...

01:11:04.958 --> 01:11:08.750
- You try to run,
or you tell anybody,

01:11:08.792 --> 01:11:11.708
and I swear to God,
I'll fucking kill you,

01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:13.124
and I'll kill her.

01:11:13.125 --> 01:11:14.124
- I swear.

01:11:14.125 --> 01:11:16.083
After tomorrow,
it'll all be over.

01:11:16.125 --> 01:11:17.624
I'll be done.

01:11:17.625 --> 01:11:18.917
- Well, I won't be here
tomorrow.

01:11:18.958 --> 01:11:20.083
I'm getting on a plane,
remember?

01:11:22.625 --> 01:11:23.625
- Just give me the day.

01:11:23.667 --> 01:11:26.083
Okay?

01:11:26.125 --> 01:11:27.583
I'll explain everything.

01:11:39.625 --> 01:11:40.917
I love you.

01:11:55.958 --> 01:11:57.666
Hey, Carl.

01:11:57.667 --> 01:11:59.999
It... it's Bobby.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.958
Listen, I need a favor.

01:12:04.792 --> 01:12:06.957
- We're closed.

01:12:06.958 --> 01:12:08.875
- I'm Bobby's friend.

01:12:08.917 --> 01:12:11.000
- Oh, yeah, sure.

01:12:15.375 --> 01:12:17.042
Yeah, Bobby mentioned
you were gonna come.

01:12:17.083 --> 01:12:18.042
Come on in.
I'm Carl.

01:12:18.083 --> 01:12:19.042
- You're Carl?
- Yeah.

01:12:19.083 --> 01:12:20.708
- I'm Dennis.
- Hey, Dennis.

01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:21.875
- I'm really sorry I'm late.

01:12:21.917 --> 01:12:22.875
I just got off work.

01:12:22.917 --> 01:12:24.167
- No, that's okay.

01:12:24.208 --> 01:12:28.542
So Bobby tells me you work
on Wall Street together, huh?

01:12:28.583 --> 01:12:30.291
- No, no.

01:12:30.292 --> 01:12:31.457
I'm his boss.

01:12:31.458 --> 01:12:34.500
- Oh, and, you're looking
for an engagement ring, right?

01:12:34.542 --> 01:12:37.125
- Yeah.

01:12:37.167 --> 01:12:38.292
- I'm gonna tell you the truth.

01:12:38.333 --> 01:12:39.833
I know nothing about jewelry.

01:12:39.875 --> 01:12:40.833
I mean, really nothing.

01:12:40.875 --> 01:12:41.833
I don't wear anything.

01:12:41.875 --> 01:12:43.333
- I won't hold that against you.

01:12:43.375 --> 01:12:46.833
But my fiancée
has very expensive taste,

01:12:46.875 --> 01:12:48.290
and I want to get her something
really nice.

01:12:48.291 --> 01:12:49.500
- How much you lookin' to spend?

01:12:49.542 --> 01:12:53.124
- I'm looking to spend
about $30,000,

01:12:53.125 --> 01:12:54.956
if I can get something nice
for that.

01:12:54.957 --> 01:12:56.250
- $30,000.
- That would be great.

01:12:56.292 --> 01:12:57.250
- Yeah.

01:12:57.292 --> 01:12:58.667
You... you must be doing
very well.

01:12:58.668 --> 01:13:00.083
- I get by, yeah.

01:13:00.125 --> 01:13:04.542
- All right,
let me bring something out.

01:13:04.583 --> 01:13:07.291
These are all 21/2 to 3 karats.

01:13:07.292 --> 01:13:12.457
They're VVS1 and 2s
and pretty much all J color.

01:13:12.458 --> 01:13:13.667
- That's not an engagement ring,
is it?

01:13:13.708 --> 01:13:14.667
- Yeah, it is.

01:13:14.708 --> 01:13:17.250
If there's a diamond in here
that you like,

01:13:17.292 --> 01:13:18.542
but you don't like the setting,

01:13:18.583 --> 01:13:21.332
something like her grandmother
has a ring that she used,

01:13:21.333 --> 01:13:23.208
and she wants to put
the diamond in it...

01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:26.208
Do you know what style
she might prefer?

01:13:26.250 --> 01:13:28.292
- Everything about
getting married is so stressful.

01:13:28.333 --> 01:13:31.417
I thought... I thought an
engagement ring was one style.

01:13:31.458 --> 01:13:33.665
I didn't know there were
so many different styles.

01:13:33.666 --> 01:13:36.000
- Why don't you fish around
a little bit more, you know?

01:13:36.001 --> 01:13:38.457
Go around with her
maybe this weekend,

01:13:38.458 --> 01:13:39.458
and when you see something

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:41.000
or she sees something
that she likes,

01:13:41.001 --> 01:13:43.000
then you guys
can come back here.

01:13:43.042 --> 01:13:45.500
- I got a bunch of people
at my house tonight,

01:13:45.542 --> 01:13:49.875
and I was hoping, really hoping,
to bring something for her.

01:13:49.917 --> 01:13:50.875
You know, I got food there.

01:13:50.917 --> 01:13:52.042
We're having a whole big party.

01:13:52.083 --> 01:13:53.458
- I can't bring all of this.

01:13:53.459 --> 01:13:55.832
- I have a simple idea.

01:13:55.833 --> 01:13:56.832
I got $15,000.

01:13:56.833 --> 01:13:58.083
- It's not about the money.

01:13:58.125 --> 01:13:59.417
- No, no, no.
Just listen.

01:13:59.458 --> 01:14:01.000
Listen to what I'm gonna say.

01:14:01.042 --> 01:14:03.124
Let me give you a deposit.

01:14:03.125 --> 01:14:04.708
We take a bunch of rings,

01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:06.833
whichever ones
you think she'll like.

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:07.917
We bring them over there.

01:14:07.958 --> 01:14:08.917
I'm two minutes away.

01:14:08.958 --> 01:14:10.000
- Dennis, I'm trying to be...

01:14:10.042 --> 01:14:11.583
you know, I know
you're Bobby's friend.

01:14:11.625 --> 01:14:12.583
- Whatever one she likes,

01:14:12.625 --> 01:14:14.500
as long as we're
in that range of price,

01:14:14.542 --> 01:14:16.290
I'll pay you the balance in cash
right there.

01:14:16.291 --> 01:14:17.833
- You're talking...
there's over...

01:14:17.875 --> 01:14:19.333
over a half a million dollars
in diamonds there.

01:14:19.375 --> 01:14:20.333
- If you want,

01:14:20.375 --> 01:14:22.290
I'll give you a check right now
for the whole thing.

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:24.292
- I don't like to take
the diamonds out of the store.

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:27.000
- I have enough cash there
to pay you the balance.

01:14:27.042 --> 01:14:28.456
You'll make a sale tonight.

01:14:28.457 --> 01:14:30.333
Believe me, she'll pick a stone
in one second.

01:14:30.375 --> 01:14:32.167
She'll probably pick
the most expensive one.

01:14:32.168 --> 01:14:35.292
- Because you're Bobby's friend,
I'll take the cash,

01:14:35.333 --> 01:14:36.375
put this in the safe,

01:14:36.417 --> 01:14:38.457
and we can go
and surprise your girlfriend.

01:14:38.458 --> 01:14:40.417
- You don't want me to just
give you everything together?

01:14:40.458 --> 01:14:43.333
- No, this is good.
I like your idea.

01:14:43.375 --> 01:14:44.833
- Why don't I just
hold the money,

01:14:44.875 --> 01:14:46.292
and I can pay everything
at one time.

01:14:46.293 --> 01:14:47.957
- Oh, you know, it's bad enough

01:14:47.958 --> 01:14:49.250
that I have to
take the diamonds.

01:14:49.292 --> 01:14:52.708
I'd... I'd rather
leave the cash here.

01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:53.708
- You sure?

01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:56.667
I mean, I can just pay
everything together.

01:14:56.708 --> 01:14:59.583
- No, yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

01:14:59.625 --> 01:15:02.208
And actually, let me just...

01:15:02.250 --> 01:15:04.957
I'll make a gift
of a pair of these earrings,

01:15:04.958 --> 01:15:06.458
which is a really nice...

01:15:12.083 --> 01:15:14.457
Okay.

01:15:14.458 --> 01:15:15.958
You ready?
- Yeah.

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:33.208
- I remember this neighborhood.
- Oh, yeah'?

01:15:33.250 --> 01:15:35.708
Listen, you want to do me
a favor?

01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:37.667
Can I borrow your cell phone
one second?

01:15:37.708 --> 01:15:39.375
I just want to call
and make sure she's home.

01:15:39.417 --> 01:15:40.957
- Sure.

01:15:40.958 --> 01:15:42.542
- I was taking a piss yesterday,

01:15:42.583 --> 01:15:44.000
and I dropped it
right in the toilet.

01:15:44.001 --> 01:15:46.042
- Really?

01:15:46.083 --> 01:15:48.000
My father's teeth fell out once.

01:15:59.708 --> 01:16:04.333
Call 911!

01:16:04.375 --> 01:16:05.333
Jesus Christ!

01:16:05.375 --> 01:16:07.332
Did you see where he came from?

01:16:07.333 --> 01:16:10.042
911. Yes.

01:16:10.083 --> 01:16:12.000
I need the police!

01:16:12.042 --> 01:16:13.167
Jesus!

01:16:13.208 --> 01:16:15.666
Yes, I was just burglarized
on West Broadway...

01:16:15.667 --> 01:16:17.000
- Prince.

01:16:17.042 --> 01:16:20.000
Tell 'em he's got a green coat,
a green coat on.

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:21.500
- It's an army jacket
a green jacket.

01:16:21.501 --> 01:16:22.957
He's got reddish hair.

01:16:22.958 --> 01:16:25.958
My whole world is in that case.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.583
Oh, my God.

01:16:27.625 --> 01:16:29.083
- I feel so terrible.

01:16:29.125 --> 01:16:31.750
It's over half a million dollars
in diamonds and cash.

01:16:31.792 --> 01:16:33.000
- I'm really sorry.

01:16:33.001 --> 01:16:35.791
He came like a lightning bolt,
you know?

01:16:35.792 --> 01:16:36.792
Are you okay, though?

01:16:36.833 --> 01:16:38.000
You're okay?

01:16:39.167 --> 01:16:40.208
- Yes.
It's not your fault.

01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:42.542
- I'm, I'm really...
I feel like it's my fault.

01:16:42.583 --> 01:16:44.791
I feel terrible.

01:16:44.792 --> 01:16:45.790
Don't worry, though.

01:16:45.791 --> 01:16:47.208
The cops,
they'll find him for sure.

01:16:47.250 --> 01:16:49.833
I guarantee you
they'll catch him.

01:16:51.083 --> 01:16:52.125
- Holy shit!

01:16:52.167 --> 01:16:55.417
What the hell took you so long?

01:16:55.458 --> 01:16:56.665
- He had the balls to ask me

01:16:56.666 --> 01:16:59.000
to go down to the cops with him
and be a witness.

01:16:59.042 --> 01:17:00.625
I was like, "Yeah, right."

01:17:00.667 --> 01:17:02.583
"Man, I got to...
I'm late for my fiancée.

01:17:02.625 --> 01:17:03.667
You know, I gotta go, buddy."

01:17:03.708 --> 01:17:04.917
- Fiancée.

01:17:07.625 --> 01:17:09.917
His fiancée.

01:17:09.958 --> 01:17:11.250
I didn't even know
we were dating.

01:17:11.292 --> 01:17:12.792
- Very funny.
Where's Bobby?

01:17:12.833 --> 01:17:14.000
- He's not here.

01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:26.875
Whoa, what are you doing?

01:17:26.917 --> 01:17:28.500
I thought we were waiting
until we were all here before...

01:17:28.542 --> 01:17:30.208
- Listen to me.

01:17:30.250 --> 01:17:31.667
Bobby ain't getting shit,
all right?

01:17:31.708 --> 01:17:32.956
I'm gonna give you one ring,

01:17:32.957 --> 01:17:34.167
then we're closing up shop here.

01:17:34.208 --> 01:17:35.167
Donny!

01:17:35.208 --> 01:17:36.500
- Closing up shop?
- Lock the door!

01:17:36.542 --> 01:17:37.667
- Well, where are you gonna go?

01:17:37.708 --> 01:17:38.833
- Like I'm gonna tell you.

01:17:38.875 --> 01:17:39.875
Yeah.

01:18:07.458 --> 01:18:08.625
- Everybody on the ground!

01:18:08.667 --> 01:18:10.625
Put your hands behind your head!

01:18:46.375 --> 01:18:48.332
- You okay?

01:18:48.333 --> 01:18:50.332
- No.

01:18:50.333 --> 01:18:51.667
- Good.

01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:02.500
- What kind?

01:19:02.542 --> 01:19:03.833
- Don't know.

01:19:03.875 --> 01:19:05.458
It's a loosie.

01:19:13.125 --> 01:19:14.125
I quit.

01:19:17.458 --> 01:19:19.000
- Smoking or stealing?

01:19:20.958 --> 01:19:22.125
- Both.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.042
- What's that?

01:19:43.958 --> 01:19:45.958
- I'd get down on one knee,
but, you know,

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.499
I'm sitting in a gutter.

01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:49.542
It probably wouldn't be
that romantic.

01:19:58.583 --> 01:20:01.375
- Hey, that wouldn't be
from your lastjob, would it?

01:20:08.417 --> 01:20:12.458
- Carl gave me a good deal,
future employee discount.

01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:22.792
Lucy.
- I know.

01:20:26.458 --> 01:20:28.708
Carl came to visit me
at the hospital

01:20:28.750 --> 01:20:30.500
and told me
what you guys were doing.

01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:35.917
- And you still let Gomer
beat the crap out of me?

01:20:35.958 --> 01:20:39.000
- Well, I was kind of pissed
you didn't tell me yourself.

01:20:44.208 --> 01:20:45.500
He did a pretty good job,
though.

01:21:00.167 --> 01:21:01.208
- Are you sure?

01:21:05.083 --> 01:21:06.500
- No.

01:21:21.917 --> 01:21:23.625
