WEBVTT

00:24.992 --> 00:26.016
That for me?

01:50.010 --> 01:51.705
You okay?

01:52.680 --> 01:54.204
Nice gangster walk.

01:54.682 --> 01:57.776
I feel like I was thrown out
of a moving car.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.650
You were thrown out
of a moving car.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.118
Several times.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.519
Yeah, well, not recently.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.350
Was I?

02:09.530 --> 02:10.723
This is what I'm telling you.

02:10.898 --> 02:13.230
If you don't take care of yourself,
it becomes cumulative.

02:13.400 --> 02:16.028
Every broken bone, gunshot,
stab wound...

02:16.203 --> 02:17.534
Camel bite.

02:17.705 --> 02:20.799
It starts to add up.
You need a real bed, a real diet,

02:20.974 --> 02:22.737
some flaxseed oil.
Maybe a little Pilates.

02:22.910 --> 02:25.003
You know what?
I'll stick with coffee and aspirin.

02:25.179 --> 02:27.238
See, you're treating the symptoms,
not the problem.

02:27.414 --> 02:29.905
I can't have a partner
I need to push around in a wheelchair.

02:30.117 --> 02:32.017
Where you think you gonna be
in a few years?

02:32.186 --> 02:34.746
Probably be killed on the job
long before that.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.082
Why do you do that?

02:36.256 --> 02:39.157
Why do I even talk to you?
You keep this up, I'm gonna stop.

02:40.194 --> 02:41.752
Promises, promises.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.564
"Angry Birds"?

02:46.734 --> 02:48.065
"Plants vs. Zombies."

02:48.235 --> 02:50.567
Played for four hours straight
last night.

02:50.738 --> 02:53.002
I don't know if I'm proud
or ashamed of that.

02:53.173 --> 02:56.074
Did you get the, uh...? Ow.

02:56.243 --> 02:59.235
- Did you get the little Hetty note?
- No.

02:59.413 --> 03:02.246
By the way, there's no such thing
as a "little Hetty note."

03:02.416 --> 03:03.906
There's a big Hetty note.

03:04.084 --> 03:06.348
There's a holy moly Hetty note.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.384
There's an
"Oh, dear God" Hetty note.

03:09.256 --> 03:11.247
I get it.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.016
How bad is it?

03:14.194 --> 03:16.162
Expense account?

03:16.530 --> 03:18.430
- Hygiene again?
- I haven't opened it.

03:18.966 --> 03:22.265
Oh, brave man, Mr. Deeks.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.927
I'd be quick about it.
We have a problem.

03:25.105 --> 03:29.303
More specifically,
I have a problem with you.

03:29.476 --> 03:33.037
- Me?
- At a routine Agent Readiness audit,

03:33.213 --> 03:36.148
you were found to be woefully
behind the rest of the team in...

03:36.316 --> 03:37.908
"Professional development."

03:38.085 --> 03:40.451
- Yes.
- Coursework to further one's skill set

03:40.621 --> 03:41.713
in a given profession.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.619
While we may believe
that you are up to the task,

03:45.993 --> 03:47.824
Statistically speaking,

03:47.995 --> 03:52.955
an agent's training level
has a high correlation to survival.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.464
- Who am I to argue with statistics?
- Right.

03:56.637 --> 03:57.661
No, no, of course.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.465
But my training comes
from the streets.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.835
Really? The tough streets
of the San Fernando Valley?

04:02.009 --> 04:04.170
Not exactly Fallujah, Kandahar
and Medellin.

04:04.344 --> 04:06.835
Okay, you don't get to pull
the Special Forces tough guy card.

04:07.014 --> 04:09.278
It's not in your wallet.
Maybe Sam's, maybe Callen's.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.475
- Maybe Hetty's.
- Maybe Hetty...

04:14.621 --> 04:17.749
You will choose
from that list of courses, Mr. Deeks.

04:18.492 --> 04:23.088
And you, Miss Blye, will be in charge
of overseeing its completion.

04:26.033 --> 04:29.628
Ops Center. We have a case.

04:31.438 --> 04:34.430
"CQB. Close quarter battle.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.709
Urban Warfare"?

04:36.877 --> 04:41.246
I took CQB and Urban. It's excellent.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.679
This is a terrible idea.

04:46.453 --> 04:49.149
I bet you even got
your special agent friendship badge.

04:49.323 --> 04:52.690
You're lucky they let you get this far
without your DoD advance training.

04:52.860 --> 04:55.522
Okay, I am an L.A.P.D. Liaison.

04:55.696 --> 04:56.993
So we were led to believe.

04:57.164 --> 04:59.291
Offensive driving? Really?
This is Los Angeles.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.866
Everybody's driving is offensive.
I've already taken that.

05:02.035 --> 05:05.835
Isn't there,
like, a master of disguise course

05:06.006 --> 05:07.667
or, like, a ninja weapons?

05:07.841 --> 05:10.674
You know, that would be cool.

05:10.844 --> 05:14.245
Let's make this quick, Eric.
Deeks has gotta get back to class.

05:14.414 --> 05:16.075
Is there no privacy here?

05:16.283 --> 05:17.307
No.

05:17.484 --> 05:21.011
Apparently, Hetty is determined
to make you a highly skilled operative.

05:21.188 --> 05:22.212
Good luck with that.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.421
I'm a highly skilled operative.

05:26.994 --> 05:30.020
- What? I am.
- Of course you are, Mr. Deeks.

05:31.298 --> 05:32.560
Eric, please?

05:32.733 --> 05:35.395
According to the time stamp,
these photos were taken two days ago.

05:35.569 --> 05:36.593
At the Malibu Pier.

05:36.803 --> 05:40.432
They were anonymously e-mailed
to the NCIS Headquarters last night.

05:40.607 --> 05:41.665
The guy in the green

05:41.842 --> 05:43.742
is Lieutenant Commander
Daniel Chambers,

05:43.911 --> 05:45.742
- Naval Intelligence.
- Who's the other guy?

05:45.913 --> 05:47.437
We don't know yet.

05:47.614 --> 05:49.582
Let's say
this was his last trip to the pier.

05:49.750 --> 05:50.808
Strangled.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.375
With a garrote.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.885
Body was found by a surfer
who called 911.

05:55.055 --> 05:58.821
Call came in seven minutes after
these were taken of his meeting.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.252
What about Chambers?

06:00.427 --> 06:03.692
He's a fully trained
and highly regarded intel officer

06:03.864 --> 06:05.764
assigned
to the Defense Intelligence Agency.

06:05.933 --> 06:09.369
- Has not reported for duty in two days.
- Since the photos were taken.

06:09.536 --> 06:12.266
Now, Chambers is an expert
in Venezuelan politics.

06:12.439 --> 06:14.873
He's been tracking a rising star,
Antonio Medina,

06:15.042 --> 06:17.943
who is supposedly
going to give President Hugo Chavez

06:18.111 --> 06:20.079
a run for his money
in the next election.

06:20.247 --> 06:21.908
Medina is also pro-America.

06:22.349 --> 06:24.715
The kicker is Medina is on his way
to Los Angeles.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.644
We have any idea
where Chambers is now?

06:26.853 --> 06:29.219
His car has been parked
in the same spot for two days.

06:29.389 --> 06:33.223
His credit cards have not been used
and his phone has been turned off.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.826
Not promising.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.293
I did access
his cell phone's incoming calls.

06:37.464 --> 06:39.762
Mostly from his ex-wife
and the base.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.332
But on the day he went missing,

06:41.501 --> 06:44.902
there's three calls
from the Malibu Hotel, room 303.

06:45.472 --> 06:48.100
That's just five blocks
from the Malibu Pier.

06:48.275 --> 06:51.335
Sam and I will take the motel.
Kensi, Deeks, talk to the ex-wife.

06:51.511 --> 06:54.412
One guy strangled, one guy missing,
another guy taking photos of it.

06:54.581 --> 06:57.175
Just another day in Tinseltown.

07:03.690 --> 07:06.318
What do you think the chances are
Chambers is still alive?

07:06.493 --> 07:08.120
I'm hoping for the best.

07:08.295 --> 07:10.024
But expecting the worst.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.393
Half empty.

07:20.907 --> 07:22.465
Clear.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.205
Clear.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.142
Antonio Medina's L.A. Itinerary.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.784
Times, places
and standard operating procedures.

07:34.921 --> 07:37.355
Everything you need to assist
with his security detail.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.495
Or an assassination.

07:50.070 --> 07:53.005
It's a quick trip.
In and out, lands in one hour.

07:53.173 --> 07:56.199
If they're gonna hit him,
it will be in the next six hours.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.071
Tick-tock.

08:10.255 --> 08:11.950
Okay.

08:12.991 --> 08:15.789
Surveillance video doesn't show
the room or the parking lot

08:15.961 --> 08:17.588
or the manager's office.

08:17.763 --> 08:19.060
Well, that's effective.

08:19.231 --> 08:21.665
Manager says the room was rented
by a woman who paid in cash

08:21.867 --> 08:25.098
for the entire month.
Doesn't remember Chambers.

08:25.270 --> 08:26.601
Makes sense.

08:26.772 --> 08:29.832
This looks like the kind of place
you'd come not to be remembered.

08:30.008 --> 08:31.066
What about the woman?

08:31.443 --> 08:34.173
Medium height, dark hair,
sunglasses.

08:34.379 --> 08:36.438
So basically half the women in L.A.

08:37.916 --> 08:41.408
Eric is sending a surveillance crew
in case somebody comes back.

08:41.587 --> 08:43.520
Two guys meet, one ends up dead.

08:43.688 --> 08:45.520
The other hasn't been heard from
since.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.750
There's no way this plays out well
for Chambers.

08:47.926 --> 08:51.123
He's either the killer,
he's on the run, or he's dead.

08:52.998 --> 08:55.023
Medina needs to cancel his visit.

08:55.200 --> 08:56.690
Hetty spoke
with the State Department.

08:56.902 --> 08:59.928
Medina's visit is still on.
They think we're overreacting.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.140
Typical.

09:03.308 --> 09:05.367
Political ambition trumps
common sense.

09:05.544 --> 09:07.512
Apparently
Medina is some critical ally.

09:07.679 --> 09:10.512
He's supposed to raise over
a million dollars at tonight's fundraiser.

09:10.682 --> 09:14.982
So, uh, canceling
or visible security is bad for business.

09:16.054 --> 09:17.112
At the very least,

09:17.289 --> 09:20.281
they need to alter his itinerary
and change the venue.

09:20.459 --> 09:22.723
Their dignitary doesn't believe
the threat.

09:25.030 --> 09:27.225
Surveillance unit is two minutes out.

09:27.432 --> 09:31.061
Chambers' director is at the boat shed.
Nell is an expert on South America.

09:31.236 --> 09:32.294
She's already there.

09:38.076 --> 09:42.911
Thanks. Callen and Sam just found
evidence that someone might be trying

09:43.081 --> 09:45.311
- to assassinate Medina.
- The plot thickens.

09:45.484 --> 09:47.145
You ready to check out
Chambers' ex-wife?

09:47.319 --> 09:49.583
Don't know. I haven't taken
my Bungalow Breaching course

09:49.755 --> 09:52.849
or my Tactical Ex-wife Interrogation
using household objects.

09:53.025 --> 09:54.856
- Oh, no.
- What?

09:55.027 --> 09:56.688
Are you sulking?

09:56.862 --> 09:59.330
- I'm not sulking because I don't sulk.
- Oh, you sulk.

09:59.498 --> 10:02.092
- Other boys hurt your feelings?
- Nice. Now you're mocking me.

10:02.267 --> 10:04.360
That's awesome. You know why?
That's who you are.

10:04.536 --> 10:07.596
- You're a mocker.
- You're a sulker.

10:07.906 --> 10:09.771
- Mocker.
- Sulker.

10:14.346 --> 10:15.404
- Mocker.
- Yes?

10:16.215 --> 10:17.944
Emily Chambers?
I'm Detective Marty Deeks.

10:18.116 --> 10:20.414
This is Special Agent Kensi Blye.
NCIS.

10:20.586 --> 10:22.952
We wanted to ask some questions
about your ex-husband?

10:23.121 --> 10:25.555
Sure. Uh, of course.

10:25.724 --> 10:27.521
Is Daniel in some sort of trouble?

10:27.693 --> 10:29.251
That's what we're trying to find out.

10:29.428 --> 10:30.486
Come on in.

10:32.097 --> 10:34.930
Lieutenant Commander
Chambers joined DIA two years ago.

10:35.267 --> 10:38.566
He was put on our
Venezuela Task Force last August.

10:38.737 --> 10:43.606
Tracking Antonio Medina
who is not only a rising star,

10:43.775 --> 10:47.302
he's also pro-American.
And that is a rarity in Venezuela.

10:47.879 --> 10:49.403
Chambers turn up
anything interesting?

10:49.581 --> 10:51.139
Yeah, he covered his bases.

10:51.316 --> 10:53.648
Submitted
multiple intelligence reports.

10:54.553 --> 10:58.148
Our job is to keep an eye
on the local political terrain,

10:58.323 --> 11:00.951
particularly nations hostile
to U.S. Interests.

11:01.260 --> 11:03.558
See if anything big
is coming down the pike.

11:03.729 --> 11:05.128
He was very meticulous.

11:05.297 --> 11:08.289
Any chance
Chambers is doing something illegal?

11:08.467 --> 11:10.094
He's an absolute straight arrow. No.

11:10.269 --> 11:12.499
If anything, the guy was too passionate
about his work.

11:12.671 --> 11:16.664
"Medina is, quote, 'an opportunist.'
If he was elected to higher office,

11:16.842 --> 11:18.969
he would be worse
than Hugo Chavez"?

11:19.144 --> 11:20.168
Worse than Chavez?

11:20.345 --> 11:22.176
The guy who called America
a terrorist state?

11:23.682 --> 11:25.513
- I thought Medina was a U.S. Ally?
- Hold on.

11:25.684 --> 11:28.346
Chambers' background
is computer science.

11:28.553 --> 11:30.783
And by that, you mean
he was basing his assumptions

11:30.956 --> 11:33.015
on a souped-up HIPS analysis?

11:33.191 --> 11:36.490
HIPS is experimental.
Not to mention classified.

11:36.662 --> 11:38.755
Chambers was beta testing a version
of HIPS:

11:38.930 --> 11:39.954
High precision search.

11:40.132 --> 11:43.590
Basically, it analyzes everything
a person says publicly over a lifetime

11:43.769 --> 11:46.761
to uncover extremist views
otherwise missed.

11:46.938 --> 11:48.200
In essence, yes.

11:50.575 --> 11:52.133
Were any of these views missed?

11:52.311 --> 11:54.211
By the intelligence community.

11:54.379 --> 11:55.937
CIA, DIA?

11:56.114 --> 11:57.206
According to Chambers.

11:57.382 --> 11:59.714
- Hmm, awkward.
- Excuse me, who are you?

12:00.719 --> 12:02.516
Uh, Intelligence Analyst Nell Jones.

12:03.855 --> 12:07.291
The algorithm, as used by Chambers,
is unproven.

12:07.459 --> 12:09.825
And no replacement
for human intel.

12:09.995 --> 12:11.986
Yeah.
I've played around with it a fair bit.

12:12.164 --> 12:14.029
I was able to spot
General Manuel Noriega,

12:14.199 --> 12:17.225
when the U.S. Supported him,
Pol Pot in the early days,

12:17.402 --> 12:19.302
Mikhail Gorbachev.
When we still hated him.

12:19.471 --> 12:20.495
Came out a moderate.

12:21.206 --> 12:25.165
Chambers was in the early stages
of intelligence gathering.

12:25.344 --> 12:29.678
Oh, it's interesting stuff
but ultimately a bit far-fetched.

12:29.848 --> 12:32.544
Really? Because the stakes aren't.

12:33.652 --> 12:36.086
I mean, Venezuela has known ties
to Iran, does it not?

12:36.254 --> 12:37.881
- Yes, but...
- And we know that Iran

12:38.056 --> 12:39.546
has a clandestine
nuclear program

12:39.725 --> 12:41.693
that could spread
to the southern hemisphere.

12:41.860 --> 12:43.555
It's a remote risk.

12:43.729 --> 12:46.357
And isn't it true that Venezuela
has been trying to form a bloc

12:46.531 --> 12:48.260
with Bolivia, Nicaragua and Cuba

12:48.433 --> 12:50.401
to counter U.S. Dominance
in the region?

12:50.569 --> 12:51.866
There have been concerns, yeah.

12:52.037 --> 12:54.164
Add into the mix
a nuclear Venezuela,

12:54.339 --> 12:57.274
and now you have a nuke
90 miles off the coast of Florida.

12:57.442 --> 12:59.410
Not to mention
the more realistic possibility

12:59.578 --> 13:02.172
that these become a training
and launching ground for al Qaeda.

13:02.347 --> 13:04.781
Okay, Nell, thank you.

13:06.218 --> 13:07.708
Can we have the captain
for a minute?

13:08.153 --> 13:09.177
Uh, yeah, sure.

13:09.354 --> 13:10.514
It was nice to meet you.

13:11.957 --> 13:13.788
The pleasure is all mine.

13:18.263 --> 13:19.696
But you're not buying it, are you?

13:19.965 --> 13:22.763
Medina was resolutely
pro-American.

13:22.934 --> 13:25.095
He's beloved
by the ex-pat community here.

13:25.270 --> 13:28.797
Chambers' HIPS analysis contradicts
everything we know.

13:28.974 --> 13:31.067
- What if he's right?
- I doubt it.

13:32.811 --> 13:36.440
Occam's razor.
The simplest explanation is the best.

13:36.615 --> 13:38.412
Usually the best.

13:39.751 --> 13:42.720
Sounds to me like you ignored
your intel officer

13:42.888 --> 13:44.378
and may have stumbled
across something

13:44.556 --> 13:47.389
- that might have gotten him killed.
- Well, I truly hope not.

13:47.559 --> 13:48.890
Chambers was a good man.

13:50.061 --> 13:51.289
Let's hope he still is.

13:58.303 --> 13:59.770
Am I in trouble?

14:00.205 --> 14:01.672
No.

14:01.840 --> 14:04.070
But next time pick on someone
your own size.

14:06.711 --> 14:08.303
Take a look at this.

14:17.956 --> 14:20.982
But we would also like
the pride and respect to come back

14:21.159 --> 14:23.593
to the people of Venezuela.

14:23.762 --> 14:26.322
You don't just need a leader,

14:27.599 --> 14:29.499
you need a great leader.

14:32.237 --> 14:35.434
A friend to nations, large and small.

14:36.308 --> 14:37.502
Impressive speaker.

14:37.943 --> 14:39.433
Charisma to spare.

14:39.611 --> 14:41.943
In the right context,
he'd be a force to be reckoned with.

14:42.247 --> 14:43.680
What kind of force is he?

14:43.849 --> 14:46.818
Pro, anti, terrorist threat.
Other kind of threat?

14:46.985 --> 14:49.647
It doesn't matter
what kind of a threat Medina is.

14:49.821 --> 14:51.982
The only thing that matters
is that we keep him safe

14:52.157 --> 14:54.887
from being assassinated
on U.S. Soil.

14:56.161 --> 14:58.857
Has your husband ever mentioned
the name Antonio Medina to you?

15:00.665 --> 15:01.723
No.

15:01.900 --> 15:05.461
But we don't talk about work.
We talk all the time about Allie.

15:05.637 --> 15:07.537
Because she doesn't speak
to the two of us,

15:07.706 --> 15:09.674
but that's because on any given day,

15:09.841 --> 15:13.004
one of the two of us
is ruining her 12-year-old life.

15:13.545 --> 15:15.035
- Hey, Mom.
- Yes.

15:15.213 --> 15:16.407
Can I have your laptop?

15:16.581 --> 15:18.515
Why don't you finish
your homework?

15:19.084 --> 15:20.483
Because I don't feel like it.

15:25.824 --> 15:29.021
I saw a pretty cool trampoline out
back there. You mind if I jump on it?

15:31.596 --> 15:33.655
What?
Cops can't jump on trampolines?

15:35.000 --> 15:36.058
That's right, I'm a cop.

15:36.234 --> 15:37.929
Chase bad guys, eat doughnuts.

15:41.506 --> 15:43.337
It's okay, Als.

15:43.508 --> 15:45.874
Why don't you show the detective
the backyard?

15:46.044 --> 15:47.773
I saw that, you rolled your eyes.

15:47.946 --> 15:50.608
I'll race you on three.
One, two, three. Go.

15:50.815 --> 15:52.214
What?

15:52.384 --> 15:54.818
So can you tell me what is going on?

15:55.253 --> 15:57.346
Who is Antonio Medina?

15:57.522 --> 15:59.422
Your ex-husband thinks
that he might be

15:59.591 --> 16:01.252
a national security threat.

16:01.426 --> 16:03.326
He might be caught up
in something dangerous.

16:03.762 --> 16:06.629
Daniel? Heh.

16:07.265 --> 16:10.234
No, that is not possible.
Daniel is way too by-the-book.

16:10.402 --> 16:13.963
And he wouldn't do anything
that would take him away from Allie.

16:17.776 --> 16:20.973
I haven't seen that in a while.
She's actually laughing.

16:21.279 --> 16:23.042
Yeah, he has that effect on people.

16:24.349 --> 16:26.112
She's had a really tough time lately.

16:26.284 --> 16:28.809
You know,
at her age with friends and school,

16:28.987 --> 16:31.080
plus a divorce,

16:31.556 --> 16:34.252
if something were to happen
to her dad, it...

16:35.393 --> 16:37.258
It sounds
like you two are pretty tight.

16:38.797 --> 16:41.129
He's a great guy, he's a great Dad.

16:41.299 --> 16:42.425
We are not a great couple.

16:48.506 --> 16:50.167
Hello?

16:51.676 --> 16:53.473
Hello?

16:55.313 --> 16:57.110
That's the third time today.

16:57.282 --> 16:59.341
Think that might be your ex
trying to reach Allie?

16:59.517 --> 17:00.677
She got one too.

17:06.657 --> 17:10.355
Hey, Eric? I need you to trace
the last call to Emily Chambers.

17:10.528 --> 17:12.018
Searching.

17:12.196 --> 17:13.755
It's a cell phone.

17:13.932 --> 17:15.455
Tracing the GPS.

17:16.468 --> 17:19.460
Got it. Kensi, the call came
from right outside the house.

17:22.507 --> 17:23.531
Deeks.

17:23.708 --> 17:25.107
Yeah?

17:26.011 --> 17:27.444
I'm coming. Hey.

17:27.612 --> 17:28.636
- Bye.
- See you.

17:28.813 --> 17:30.007
- Let's go.
- That was fun.

17:32.784 --> 17:35.685
- Awesome kid, by the way.
- Thank you.

17:44.562 --> 17:45.620
There.

17:45.797 --> 17:46.957
Blue truck.

17:50.969 --> 17:52.960
What is he doing?

17:54.205 --> 17:55.797
Hold up.

18:09.888 --> 18:12.356
What did I say about L.A. Drivers?

18:22.799 --> 18:23.857
- Eric?
- Yeah.

18:24.034 --> 18:26.559
Pull every surveillance camera
in a ten-block radius.

18:26.737 --> 18:31.436
Blue pick-up truck, GMC, '07 or '08.
No plates. Just tried to run us down.

18:31.608 --> 18:33.098
Accessing surveillance.

18:33.277 --> 18:35.211
ATMs, traffic cams.

18:35.379 --> 18:38.405
- Can you track the cell phone?
- It's turned off. It was a burn phone.

18:38.982 --> 18:40.279
Probably dumped it.

18:40.450 --> 18:42.042
- You get a look at the driver?
- No.

18:42.219 --> 18:45.484
The man strangled in the parking lot,
his family reported him missing.

18:45.689 --> 18:47.987
We have a name and address.

18:54.131 --> 18:55.928
My Uncle Juan was a day laborer.

18:56.733 --> 18:59.634
He'd go to the Home Depot
or car wash every morning.

18:59.803 --> 19:01.566
We're very sorry for your loss.

19:01.738 --> 19:03.205
It's just so ironic.

19:03.573 --> 19:05.837
We left Juarez
because of the violence.

19:06.009 --> 19:08.239
The cartels, the drug war.

19:08.412 --> 19:10.903
Juan was from Mexico?
Not Venezuela?

19:11.315 --> 19:12.339
Yes. We all are.

19:13.917 --> 19:15.441
Everyone in this complex.

19:15.819 --> 19:17.013
Everyone we know, really.

19:17.220 --> 19:18.778
That's L.A.

19:18.956 --> 19:20.651
When was the last time
you saw your uncle?

19:20.824 --> 19:22.189
Two days ago.

19:22.359 --> 19:24.293
I have a driver's license,

19:24.461 --> 19:28.591
so I drop the guys off by the car wash
on Tujunga at 4 a.m.

19:28.765 --> 19:31.131
- Hard-working guys.
- And girls.

19:32.669 --> 19:35.137
My family didn't come here
just to sit around.

19:35.305 --> 19:36.966
We came for a better life.

19:37.140 --> 19:38.971
And I'm determined
to see it through.

19:39.142 --> 19:40.507
I'm sure you will, Rosa.

19:47.050 --> 19:49.678
This day labor hang out
has got a hundred guys.

19:49.853 --> 19:51.184
Probably could've been anyone.

19:51.355 --> 19:53.983
And they just needed somebody
to be the delivery guy.

19:54.157 --> 19:57.888
Eric. I'm sending you the address
where our delivery guy was last seen.

19:58.862 --> 20:01.888
Got it.
Sending it to Kensi and Deeks now.

20:12.042 --> 20:14.510
Nothing.
They say they know nothing.

20:14.678 --> 20:16.703
Or to be more exact,
"No habla Inglés."

20:16.880 --> 20:19.474
Then I started speaking Spanish,
they said, "No habla Español."

20:21.184 --> 20:23.152
I think they think I'm ICE.

20:23.520 --> 20:26.683
- I think they just don't like you.
- I'm telling you.

20:26.890 --> 20:28.187
All right, go get them, tiger.

20:55.719 --> 20:57.311
Okay, gracias.

21:01.224 --> 21:02.691
- Kens.
- Eric.

21:02.859 --> 21:04.451
I've got a positive ID on the truck.

21:04.628 --> 21:06.960
Juan Munoz was picked up
at the car wash.

21:07.130 --> 21:08.188
Copy that.

21:08.365 --> 21:10.265
Nice. Nice, I'm impressed.

21:10.434 --> 21:12.925
Don't do that. Don't gloat.

21:13.437 --> 21:15.564
- Did you choose a class yet?
- Or nag.

21:16.640 --> 21:18.267
I'm happy to share.
I'm thinking FATS.

21:18.442 --> 21:20.273
Firearms training simulator.

21:20.444 --> 21:23.777
Nice. Lots of interesting theories and
techniques to get your head around.

21:23.947 --> 21:25.312
- I can test you.
- No, no, no.

21:25.482 --> 21:28.610
I picked it because I know it.
It's in here. You wanna know why?

21:29.853 --> 21:31.650
Because working a case
is my classroom.

21:32.756 --> 21:35.384
That is a very small classroom.

21:38.428 --> 21:40.293
What have we got, Eric?

21:40.464 --> 21:44.594
This is from a traffic camera
outside the car wash.

21:45.302 --> 21:49.136
The footage was taken at 10:04 a.m.
Two days ago.

21:50.941 --> 21:52.340
That's Munoz.

21:52.509 --> 21:53.771
And here is our driver.

21:53.944 --> 21:57.402
It's a she. Ran facial recognition,
but the image is too blurry.

21:57.581 --> 21:59.811
That fits the description of the woman
from the motel.

21:59.983 --> 22:05.011
So now our mystery woman
picks up day laborer Munoz,

22:05.188 --> 22:09.022
who winds up dead after a hand off
to our missing Chambers.

22:09.192 --> 22:11.183
She then rents a motel room

22:11.394 --> 22:13.988
from which Chambers receives
numerous phone calls

22:14.164 --> 22:17.759
and we find classified details
of Medina's itinerary.

22:17.934 --> 22:21.768
And now the truck she's driving
is staking out Chambers' house.

22:21.938 --> 22:23.872
If they've killed Chambers,
the question is why.

22:24.040 --> 22:26.270
What did he know
that could've jeopardized their plan?

22:26.443 --> 22:29.344
What if Chambers didn't stumble
on the plot?

22:29.513 --> 22:31.310
What if he's a part of the plot?

22:31.481 --> 22:32.505
Chambers went rogue?

22:32.916 --> 22:35.441
He sent up warning flares,
nobody believed him.

22:35.619 --> 22:38.679
He sees Medina's rise to power
as an issue of national security.

22:39.156 --> 22:41.784
Chambers gets the manila envelope
with Medina's itinerary.

22:41.958 --> 22:44.859
He disappears.
Kills Munoz to cover his tracks.

22:45.028 --> 22:47.826
Or he's being forced into it? Someone
could have leverage over him.

22:47.998 --> 22:49.625
No. Chambers' record
was squeaky clean.

22:49.799 --> 22:52.996
No evidence of alcohol or drug abuse.
No gambling, no debts.

22:53.170 --> 22:56.298
Or maybe someone needs leverage
over him.

22:56.473 --> 22:59.169
We still don't know what that truck
is doing outside the house.

23:00.377 --> 23:04.245
Only way you get to a man
like Chambers is through his daughter.

23:07.350 --> 23:09.648
OMG.

23:09.819 --> 23:11.218
I know.

23:11.388 --> 23:12.912
I know.

23:13.089 --> 23:15.387
He was a total crazy person.

23:15.559 --> 23:18.153
But totally cute too.

23:18.495 --> 23:20.486
I can't believe I just said that.

23:20.664 --> 23:22.962
You can't tell anyone.

23:23.201 --> 23:25.465
Please, please, plea... Aah!

23:47.856 --> 23:49.346
Go ahead.

23:57.699 --> 23:58.723
Hey.

24:02.204 --> 24:04.035
- Callen.
- Kensi, anything?

24:04.206 --> 24:06.800
No. Emily is hanging in there.

24:06.975 --> 24:08.840
An Amber Alert was sent out.

24:09.010 --> 24:10.375
It's all over the local news,

24:10.545 --> 24:12.979
- freeway signs and Internet.
- Nice going.

24:13.148 --> 24:15.981
Yeah, but it wasn't us. Nine-one-one
got three calls in four minutes.

24:16.151 --> 24:17.175
Four minutes?

24:17.352 --> 24:19.752
Including two accurate
license plate numbers

24:19.921 --> 24:24.324
and a lady ID'd the van a block away.
She had gotten a text from a friend.

24:24.492 --> 24:28.326
- Huh. Nice neighbors.
- Yeah.

24:30.265 --> 24:31.857
Well, everyone is okay here,

24:32.033 --> 24:34.763
so thank her mom for participating
and come on back.

24:34.936 --> 24:36.927
- Agents will let us know if he calls.
- Okay.

24:58.727 --> 25:00.695
You know what? Okay.

25:01.162 --> 25:02.527
You ready?

25:03.531 --> 25:04.930
Tough.

25:05.100 --> 25:06.533
Tough.

25:06.701 --> 25:08.100
Wha...?

25:12.440 --> 25:15.603
Eight wins in a row. Wow.

25:18.613 --> 25:20.740
Little card shark.

25:24.452 --> 25:26.147
- Anything?
- No.

25:26.321 --> 25:27.379
Allie?

25:27.555 --> 25:29.386
She's happy
she played her part well.

25:29.557 --> 25:30.956
She's worried about her dad.

25:31.426 --> 25:34.259
If they're trying to leverage him,
we've taken that away from them.

25:34.429 --> 25:37.660
And if he's acting alone,
this might flush him out.

25:37.832 --> 25:40.995
Unless he doesn't care about
his daughter, because he's snapped.

25:41.202 --> 25:43.227
Or he thinks killing Medina
will protect her

25:43.405 --> 25:46.397
from what he sees is a growing threat
to her future.

25:46.741 --> 25:50.768
I gotta tell you,
I'm not liking any of these scenarios.

25:57.452 --> 26:00.649
Top three things to think of in a good
shoot/bad shoot operational scenario.

26:00.822 --> 26:03.154
- What?
- Your professional development.

26:03.325 --> 26:04.986
Oh, the bad guys.

26:05.160 --> 26:06.991
Hostages,
furtive movement and anomalies.

26:07.162 --> 26:08.993
Like a guy wearing
a parka during the summer.

26:09.164 --> 26:10.631
Yeah, I know what an anomaly is.

26:10.799 --> 26:13.097
Medina's security team
has been with him a long time.

26:13.268 --> 26:14.326
Military training.

26:14.502 --> 26:16.629
Highly qualified, no red flags.

26:16.805 --> 26:18.329
Their plan is good.

26:18.506 --> 26:21.441
Arrive at Santa Monica Airport.
No public access.

26:21.609 --> 26:25.204
Head straight to the fundraiser at
a private reception hall in Beverly Hills,

26:25.380 --> 26:26.506
turn around and leave.

26:26.681 --> 26:28.842
The route they're taking
hasn't been determined yet.

26:29.017 --> 26:32.282
Decide that at the last minute to avoid
having to secure miles of city streets.

26:32.454 --> 26:34.285
Best point of contact
is the reception hall.

26:35.457 --> 26:37.687
Or catch him
during his entrance or exit.

26:37.859 --> 26:39.793
Where would
you set up to take the shot?

26:41.529 --> 26:43.019
A good vantage point from up here.

26:43.331 --> 26:45.322
Hide a collapsible rifle in your jacket,

26:45.500 --> 26:46.558
you'd have a clear shot.

26:46.768 --> 26:49.236
Maybe arrive in the morning
and find a place to hide?

26:49.404 --> 26:50.962
You just sneak in through the exit.

26:51.139 --> 26:52.367
Use a syringe.

26:52.540 --> 26:54.633
A syringe? Wouldn't he feel that?

26:54.809 --> 26:57.676
Do it fast in a crowded room,
he'll never know what hit him.

26:57.846 --> 26:59.177
Nobody would know what happened.

26:59.347 --> 27:01.577
And you create a diversion
to cloud the intended exit.

27:01.783 --> 27:04.013
By the time they lock everything down,
he'll be gone.

27:04.185 --> 27:06.551
- That's how I'd do it.
- Yeah, me too.

27:07.889 --> 27:10.255
They teach you guys that
in Lethal Injection 101?

27:10.425 --> 27:11.824
Who's mocking now?

27:11.993 --> 27:13.392
Got something on the truck.

27:13.561 --> 27:16.553
No plates,
but I found a small sticker.

27:16.731 --> 27:19.222
It's a rental,
obtained with a bogus driver's license.

27:19.401 --> 27:22.199
It is, however, fitted
with a GPS navigation system.

27:22.370 --> 27:25.203
And I have an address.

27:36.017 --> 27:37.678
If I ever go off the reservation,

27:37.852 --> 27:39.752
you have my permission
to take me out.

27:40.588 --> 27:42.453
Well, how far off?

27:42.624 --> 27:45.115
You've pushed it pretty far
and I haven't killed you yet.

27:45.960 --> 27:47.359
All the way.

27:47.529 --> 27:48.689
You know, go rogue.

27:48.963 --> 27:51.454
You? Never gonna happen.

27:51.866 --> 27:55.097
I've never seen anybody
see more sides of a coin than you.

27:55.270 --> 27:58.137
If anybody is gonna snap, it's me.

27:58.339 --> 27:59.931
You?

28:00.408 --> 28:02.205
Textbook SEAL.

28:02.377 --> 28:05.039
Your blood pressure is undetectable.
Do you have a blood pressure?

28:05.213 --> 28:07.613
If something gets to you,
you take it out on the heavy bag.

28:07.782 --> 28:09.750
You're lucky like that.

28:10.151 --> 28:12.051
Now, if anybody is gonna snap...

28:13.421 --> 28:15.116
Kensi.

28:15.924 --> 28:17.789
Good luck, Deeks.

28:22.597 --> 28:25.828
Okay. Perimeter is clear except
for the two guys at the entrance.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.331
You think Chambers is in there?

28:27.502 --> 28:29.800
- Truck is the common denominator.
- And our only lead.

28:30.438 --> 28:32.463
They're packing.

28:34.109 --> 28:35.770
All right,
so how do we wanna play this?

28:38.813 --> 28:40.781
Heh. Biscuit?

28:44.886 --> 28:46.581
Biscuit.

28:46.754 --> 28:48.449
What the hell is a biscuit?

28:49.624 --> 28:51.421
Biscuit?

28:51.960 --> 28:53.791
Biscuit?

28:53.962 --> 28:55.930
Hey, have you seen my dog?
I lost him.

28:56.097 --> 28:58.622
He's kind of medium size,
I have no idea where he is.

29:05.984 --> 29:08.578
Dude, you just fell for the biscuit.

29:10.812 --> 29:12.780
Jose? Jose, qué tu haces?

29:15.216 --> 29:17.480
Don't.

29:34.569 --> 29:35.695
Is he alive?

29:35.870 --> 29:37.462
Yeah.

29:38.640 --> 29:40.574
So much for our assassin.

29:56.456 --> 29:59.152
I gotta sit down again.

30:03.563 --> 30:05.121
Can you tell us what happened?

30:05.298 --> 30:09.928
Uh, a guy said
that he had damning evidence

30:10.103 --> 30:13.368
of, uh, Medina's ties
to the Middle East.

30:13.540 --> 30:16.566
Said to meet him on the pier
in 20 minutes or he'd leave.

30:16.743 --> 30:18.938
I figured it was safe.

30:19.112 --> 30:20.909
Last thing I remember
is walking to my car.

30:21.081 --> 30:22.139
They're not talking.

30:22.315 --> 30:23.577
What is this all about?

30:24.084 --> 30:25.312
You're the patsy.

30:25.485 --> 30:27.043
You sounded the alarm on Medina.

30:27.220 --> 30:28.915
Asking questions, writing reports.

30:29.089 --> 30:31.614
Medina gets assassinated,
you take the fall.

30:32.392 --> 30:35.259
You're lucky. By the looks of things,
we probably would've found you

30:35.429 --> 30:37.795
in a motel room dead
with a suicide note

30:38.231 --> 30:39.391
and the murder weapon.

30:39.566 --> 30:42.501
It's the perfect cover. Naval intel agent,
highly critical of Medina,

30:42.702 --> 30:43.726
snaps and kills him.

30:44.237 --> 30:45.636
You almost convinced us.

30:47.007 --> 30:48.304
What do you know about her?

30:50.444 --> 30:51.741
Her name is Helen.

30:52.946 --> 30:56.780
I met her at a lecture series at UCLA
a few weeks ago.

30:56.950 --> 30:58.417
I knew she was out of my league.

31:00.420 --> 31:05.585
We were, uh, together at a motel
when I got the call.

31:06.026 --> 31:08.927
She drove me there,
said she'd wait for me.

31:09.529 --> 31:11.019
We found this inside.

31:11.231 --> 31:13.495
Surveillance photos
from your meeting at the Malibu Pier

31:13.667 --> 31:14.691
are on the memory card.

31:14.868 --> 31:18.531
- I can't believe that I fell for this.
- They set you up good.

31:18.738 --> 31:20.262
Really, really good.

31:20.440 --> 31:21.873
Question is who are they?

31:22.175 --> 31:26.043
Look, there is a hard-line faction
in the country

31:26.246 --> 31:32.185
led by a guy named Miguel Cortez.
He's like the Karl Rove of Caracas.

31:32.352 --> 31:33.979
They stand to gain the most
out of this.

31:34.154 --> 31:38.386
They eliminate their biggest opponent
on American soil, we take the blame,

31:38.558 --> 31:40.890
and anti-Americanism
just runs rampant.

31:41.061 --> 31:42.861
Instead of leading the charge
against America,

31:42.996 --> 31:44.861
Chavez would ride the coattails
of the masses.

31:45.031 --> 31:48.467
Yeah. He's at a 70 per cent approval,
imagine 95.

31:50.804 --> 31:51.964
With a hard-line agenda.

31:52.639 --> 31:55.472
- Where is Medina now.
- He just landed.

31:55.642 --> 31:58.133
- Be in Beverly Hills in an hour.
- State won't shut it down.

31:58.311 --> 32:00.973
Neither will Medina. If they do,
we'll probably never catch them.

32:01.147 --> 32:03.377
The protocols, the itinerary.

32:04.017 --> 32:05.382
It's an inside job.

32:06.853 --> 32:08.582
Someone close to Medina.

32:08.788 --> 32:10.983
Other than Helen,
we have no idea who the players are,

32:11.157 --> 32:13.751
making their chances of success
uncomfortably high.

32:13.927 --> 32:15.417
We're gonna have
to smoke them out.

32:16.296 --> 32:17.923
- Can you walk?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

32:18.098 --> 32:21.033
I've been through SERE,
advanced hostage training.

32:21.201 --> 32:22.793
You guys and your classes.

32:48.762 --> 32:49.888
A waiter.

32:50.330 --> 32:51.456
Why do I get waiter?

32:52.432 --> 32:53.899
Talk to Hetty.

32:54.234 --> 32:56.600
And Deeks. I mean, Kensi I get.

32:58.104 --> 33:01.039
But Deeks? In that suit?

33:01.474 --> 33:02.532
I'm in polyester?

33:03.977 --> 33:06.775
- I take exception to that.
- Yeah? Except away.

33:07.280 --> 33:08.645
I'm in maroon.

33:08.848 --> 33:11.578
Can I mention
that dress is off the charts?

33:11.751 --> 33:12.877
Deeks, don't.

33:13.053 --> 33:15.283
What?
I'm just role-playing the gushing date.

33:15.455 --> 33:18.891
Yeah? Oh, come here.
You have a little...

33:19.059 --> 33:22.085
- I do?
- No, I'm just role-playing, honey.

33:32.572 --> 33:35.564
All right, so if we're right, none
of these guys should recognize you,

33:35.742 --> 33:38.267
except of course,
the people that are responsible for it.

33:38.445 --> 33:41.346
That includes that woman Helen
or whatever her real name is.

33:41.514 --> 33:42.572
I'm on that.

33:51.257 --> 33:52.622
A guy talking to his sleeve.

33:53.960 --> 33:54.984
I'm on him.

34:00.166 --> 34:01.190
Got another one.

34:01.635 --> 34:03.364
Kensi, eyes on Medina.

34:03.536 --> 34:05.970
Deeks, stay with Chambers.

34:06.139 --> 34:07.163
On it.

34:22.188 --> 34:23.712
Federal agent!

35:07.400 --> 35:08.662
Suspect down, Sam.

35:09.069 --> 35:11.970
- Two down.
- One to go.

35:12.572 --> 35:17.532
My friends, my countrymen,
mis amigos.

35:18.611 --> 35:20.238
Better yet, my friends with money.

35:23.383 --> 35:26.443
I want you to be able
to tell your friends here in L.A.,

35:26.619 --> 35:29.179
here in the City of Angels:

35:31.925 --> 35:35.622
I am Venezuelan
and I am proud of it.

35:35.795 --> 35:38.127
I love America.

35:39.065 --> 35:41.533
He sounds like he likes America.

35:41.701 --> 35:43.601
Orgullo.

35:43.937 --> 35:46.064
- Pride.
- His overriding desires

35:46.239 --> 35:48.366
for a strong Venezuela.

35:48.541 --> 35:51.476
If he's so dangerous, why
are you risking your life to save him?

35:51.644 --> 35:53.305
Assassination is rarely the answer.

35:53.513 --> 35:56.380
If he gets shot,
someone else will take his place.

35:56.549 --> 35:59.074
- Statistically speaking.
- You are meticulous.

36:00.787 --> 36:04.416
Education is the
foundation we need for our people.

36:04.591 --> 36:06.718
Whoa, we've got incoming.

36:07.227 --> 36:11.095
Education
is a matter of social justice.

36:11.264 --> 36:15.132
We need to talk
about a greater Venezuela.

36:15.301 --> 36:17.633
A brilliant and freer Venezuela.

36:17.804 --> 36:18.930
Viva Venezuela.

36:19.105 --> 36:20.595
Freedom and justice.

36:20.774 --> 36:22.765
Girl, maroon dress, 2 o'clock,
you know her?

36:24.344 --> 36:25.777
Those words

36:26.112 --> 36:28.979
- mean something important here.
- That's Helen.

36:29.849 --> 36:32.340
Kensi, we've got Helen leaving.
East side exit.

36:32.552 --> 36:33.951
Stay with Chambers.

36:34.354 --> 36:37.255
Freedom and greatness
will be ours for the taking.

36:37.423 --> 36:41.120
I invite you to join me in this journey.

37:02.882 --> 37:04.076
Get out of my way.

37:07.787 --> 37:08.879
Drop it!

37:18.832 --> 37:22.063
Just once,
I would love to get dressed up to go out

37:22.235 --> 37:24.726
and not have to chase a suspect
or get shot at.

37:24.904 --> 37:26.030
Where's the fun in that?

37:28.007 --> 37:31.238
Another wardrobe malfunction,
Miss Blye?

37:31.411 --> 37:32.810
I'm sorry, Hetty.

37:32.979 --> 37:35.971
A small price to pay
for a successful assignment.

37:36.149 --> 37:37.548
Thank you.

37:37.717 --> 37:39.548
- Any word on our three musketeers?
- Yes.

37:39.719 --> 37:44.088
Diego Brazon, head of security
and Jose Garcia, attaché,

37:44.257 --> 37:48.990
were in the army in the same unit
as Miguel Cortez.

37:49.162 --> 37:52.029
Cortez is leader
of the hard-line faction in Venezuela.

37:52.198 --> 37:54.564
Yeah. Chambers said
he's the Karl Rove of Caracas.

37:54.734 --> 37:56.361
What about Helen?

37:56.536 --> 37:58.265
Uh, real name is Maria Rivero.

37:58.438 --> 37:59.700
She's Cortez's girlfriend.

38:00.273 --> 38:02.241
No wonder she set off
my spidey senses.

38:02.408 --> 38:05.138
Anything in a skirt sets off
your spidey senses.

38:05.645 --> 38:07.772
You're right. She's right.

38:07.947 --> 38:09.847
The State Department
has come around

38:10.016 --> 38:12.075
to Chambers' assessment
of Medina.

38:12.252 --> 38:14.772
Just because someone is paranoid
doesn't mean they're not right.

38:14.921 --> 38:17.401
Or in this case, just because
you shouldn't assassinate someone

38:17.557 --> 38:19.923
doesn't mean it wouldn't make
the world a nicer place.

38:20.093 --> 38:23.187
What about Medina?
Any thanks for saving his life?

38:23.363 --> 38:24.387
He still doesn't know.

38:24.564 --> 38:26.930
What about his disappearing
security detail?

38:27.100 --> 38:28.260
He suspicious?

38:28.434 --> 38:29.731
The campaign has been informed

38:29.903 --> 38:33.566
that they were detained
on smuggling charges.

38:33.740 --> 38:35.799
Sounds to me
like the "wait and see" approach.

38:35.975 --> 38:38.375
Wait and see if he gets
assassinated somewhere else.

38:41.981 --> 38:43.608
Well, that's it for me.

38:43.783 --> 38:46.081
I need a bath,
all-l-can-eat chicken and waffle buffet.

38:46.252 --> 38:47.549
Not necessarily in that order.

38:47.720 --> 38:50.382
Not so fast, Mr. Deeks.

38:50.556 --> 38:52.615
We need to discuss your exam.

38:57.130 --> 38:58.222
Oh-ho-ho.

38:58.898 --> 38:59.922
Do we?

39:14.514 --> 39:15.811
Allie.

39:20.086 --> 39:21.849
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.

39:22.021 --> 39:25.115
Come here, baby. I missed you.

39:25.291 --> 39:26.315
Cute kid.

39:26.993 --> 39:30.190
- Except she cheats at slapjack.
- Who doesn't?

39:30.363 --> 39:32.024
And we dyed her hair.

39:32.231 --> 39:33.425
Fire red.

39:33.599 --> 39:36.466
You know, saving politicians
from getting assassinated

39:36.636 --> 39:37.762
is cool and all.

39:38.304 --> 39:40.101
But this...

39:40.807 --> 39:42.707
This is what keeps me in the game.

39:42.875 --> 39:44.172
Fire red, huh?

39:44.344 --> 39:47.507
- Yeah, fire red.
- Come on.

39:47.947 --> 39:49.437
You?

39:50.183 --> 39:51.741
Yeah.

39:52.618 --> 39:55.451
And we get to drive
some pretty cool cars.

39:56.456 --> 39:58.617
And you get to hang with me.

39:58.958 --> 40:01.483
That's not exactly a selling point.

40:03.062 --> 40:05.496
You'd rather be partnered
with Kensi and Deeks?

40:05.665 --> 40:06.893
Those my only choices?

40:07.066 --> 40:09.227
That's like choosing
between being burned, flayed

40:09.402 --> 40:10.460
or stoned to death.

40:11.471 --> 40:14.201
You wanna walk? You could walk.

40:14.574 --> 40:16.542
I'd probably be safer.

40:23.816 --> 40:25.408
Thank you.

40:27.720 --> 40:30.883
You ready, Detective Deeks?
