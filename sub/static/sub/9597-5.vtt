00:33.806 --> 00:36.507
Oh, my god.
You scared me.

00:36.542 --> 00:38.542
I almost got it.

01:06.803 --> 01:10.406
<i>We have to protect our future
by protecting our children.</i>

01:10.440 --> 01:13.642
<i>Get garbage food out
of the lunchroom now.</i>

01:13.677 --> 01:14.977
You tell them, Tom!

01:15.011 --> 01:18.848
- I'm sorry. Was that too loud?
- I like your enthusiasm.

01:18.882 --> 01:21.250
I really like Tom MacGregor Jr. ...

01:21.284 --> 01:26.854
good scottish lad from an old
Boston family, politics in his blood.

01:26.889 --> 01:31.192
Holy crap, Ma.
I can't even see the table.

01:31.226 --> 01:33.795
- Glitter, Ma?
- It's festive.

01:33.829 --> 01:35.797
It's hard to clean up.

01:37.333 --> 01:39.067
What's going on here?

01:39.101 --> 01:43.872
"Maximum depth... 180 feet"?
What are you, James Cameron?

01:43.906 --> 01:46.341
Maura.
At least he's certified.

01:46.376 --> 01:47.809
I haven't had time to take the course.

01:47.844 --> 01:52.180
So you'll do that before or
after your "outback lady walk"?

01:52.914 --> 01:53.882
Ooh.

01:53.916 --> 01:57.319
Are you also in the
remake of "Out of Africa"?

01:57.353 --> 01:58.887
Give me that.

01:58.921 --> 02:00.822
Special delivery.

02:00.857 --> 02:02.224
Oh, yeah, just walk right in.

02:02.258 --> 02:05.093
Okay, thanks.
Wow, you look hot.

02:05.128 --> 02:07.363
Nice hat.
You look hot, too, Jane.

02:07.397 --> 02:09.698
You two ever decide to
bat for the other team ...

02:09.733 --> 02:10.765
Not on your team.

02:10.834 --> 02:13.336
What is that? Is that a surfboard?
What is he doing here?

02:13.370 --> 02:14.837
He's helping me.

02:14.872 --> 02:16.839
Helping you what?
Your car's outside.

02:17.407 --> 02:19.075
Sweet, huh?

02:19.109 --> 02:20.843
"You want this dud."

02:20.878 --> 02:23.112
"This dude," Jane.
D-u-d.

02:23.146 --> 02:26.115
Yo, Mrs. Rizz, you look hot.

02:26.149 --> 02:28.083
Stop it, Giovanni, or
I'll tell your mother.

02:28.118 --> 02:29.184
No, don't tell my mom.

02:29.219 --> 02:31.753
That's what all this is about,

02:31.787 --> 02:34.156
you buying all this stuff ...
it's about Hope, isn't it?

02:34.190 --> 02:36.058
I don't know what you're talking about.

02:36.092 --> 02:38.827
Oh, yes, you do.
Whenever you get in a crisis,

02:38.861 --> 02:40.996
you get on a first-name
basis with the U.P.S. man.

02:41.030 --> 02:43.732
- Maura, it's time to find her.
- No.

02:43.767 --> 02:46.769
Only 65% of adopted children
seek out their biological parents.

02:46.803 --> 02:49.038
I'm in the other 35%.

02:49.072 --> 02:52.041
35% having an identity crisis.

02:52.075 --> 02:55.745
Rizzoli.
Yeah.

02:55.779 --> 02:58.013
Okay. We'll be right there.

02:58.048 --> 02:59.148
Come on. We got a case.

02:59.182 --> 03:02.851
Hey, you can take your vest,
'cause the murder is near Franklin park.

03:02.886 --> 03:04.453
You got a murder in
the Franklin park zoo?

03:04.487 --> 03:05.855
Why? You got family there?

03:05.889 --> 03:07.957
- Jane!
- You're so funny.

03:07.991 --> 03:11.828
She's so funny.
And hot.

<b>3x05 - Throwing Down the Gauntlet</b>

03:37.924 --> 03:39.358
What's there to talk about?

03:39.392 --> 03:41.293
My birth mother was an
unwed college student

03:41.328 --> 03:43.128
who was sneaking around
with a southie gangster.

03:43.163 --> 03:45.764
So? That's at least interesting.

03:45.799 --> 03:47.733
My birth mother married
the neighborhood plumber.

03:47.767 --> 03:50.102
The only sneaking around she
did was in filene's basement.

03:50.136 --> 03:54.106
- Paddy Doyle, my father ...
- In sperm only.

03:54.140 --> 03:56.242
Yeah, who is waiting to
be tried for 15 murders,

03:56.276 --> 03:58.310
told Hope that I died at birth.

03:58.345 --> 04:01.113
Help me understand how that could
make for a successful reunion.

04:01.147 --> 04:03.148
Don't you want to know
anything about her?

04:03.183 --> 04:06.084
- No!
- You...

04:06.118 --> 04:08.920
You found her, didn't you?

04:09.855 --> 04:11.222
You did.

04:11.257 --> 04:14.759
You're gonna get the worst case
of hives in your life if you lie.

04:16.327 --> 04:18.228
I had her first name, her age,

04:18.264 --> 04:20.765
where she went to
college, my birth date ...

04:20.798 --> 04:21.866
I couldn't help it.

04:21.901 --> 04:27.105
- Okay, so now what?
- I don't know what, okay?

04:29.842 --> 04:31.777
Good morning. What do we have?

04:31.811 --> 04:32.811
White woman, beaten.

04:32.845 --> 04:35.180
Looks like somebody
took a blow torch to her hands.

04:35.315 --> 04:38.951
- What, trying to conceal her I.D.?
- Don't think so.

04:38.986 --> 04:40.787
Found her driver's
license in her back pocket.

04:40.821 --> 04:45.091
<i>- I think Dr. Isles is going in.
- She loves dumpster diving.</i>

04:45.126 --> 04:48.328
Celia Jaffe, 27.

04:50.898 --> 04:52.432
Early-bird dumpster diver found her.

04:52.466 --> 04:56.003
So glad I brought my Tyvek suit.

04:56.037 --> 05:01.876
- Oh, shoot. I forgot mine.
- Darn. Me too.

05:01.910 --> 05:04.311
Lividity indicates she
died sometime after midnight

05:04.346 --> 05:06.914
and was dumped here shortly thereafter.

05:06.948 --> 05:08.148
It's a good thing we got an I.D.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.916
We're not getting any
prints off of these.

05:09.951 --> 05:11.818
I'll find out if she has
a husband or a boyfriend.

05:11.852 --> 05:15.455
Let's get her photographed,
get her out of here.

05:24.566 --> 05:27.301
- What are you doing?
- Checking the weather.

05:29.204 --> 05:30.538
What? I said,
"checking the weather."

05:30.605 --> 05:32.306
Okay, okay. Sheesh.

05:32.640 --> 05:34.975
Why aren't you examining the body?

05:38.446 --> 05:42.950
I knew it.
The weather? Really?

05:42.984 --> 05:46.353
It's a daily weather forecast...

05:46.387 --> 05:48.322
on her wikipedia page.

05:48.357 --> 05:50.525
Whose page?
Oh, my g...

05:50.559 --> 05:52.293
Maura, she looks just like you!

05:52.328 --> 05:55.196
You mean I look like her.

05:55.230 --> 05:59.100
Her name is Hope...
Dr. Hope Martin.

05:59.134 --> 06:00.468
Wow. She's kind of famous.

06:00.502 --> 06:03.504
"Dr. Martin founded an international
relief agency: M.E.N.D."

06:03.539 --> 06:05.840
Medical emergency network for doctors.

06:05.874 --> 06:10.044
Their mission is to treat women
and children who are suffering.

06:10.079 --> 06:11.512
Keep scrolling.

06:11.547 --> 06:14.982
See the forensic pathology
residency she did in Sarajevo?

06:15.016 --> 06:16.917
- Yeah.
- She's done everything.

06:16.952 --> 06:19.454
So she identifies victims of genocide

06:19.488 --> 06:21.856
and saves women and children
around the world ...  big deal.

06:22.290 --> 06:25.126
You are just as accomplished, Maura.

06:25.160 --> 06:29.131
No, I'm not.
Paddy said she was brilliant.

06:29.165 --> 06:30.599
And recently divorced.

06:30.633 --> 06:33.168
She has a daughter...
Cailin, 18.

06:33.203 --> 06:36.438
She's been living abroad
for the past 20 years.

06:38.108 --> 06:41.644
Okay, Celia Jaffe needs an autopsy.
And I need a cause of death, Maura.

06:41.678 --> 06:43.245
Hope even developed a technique

06:43.279 --> 06:47.282
to identify the victims of genocide
we're still using today.

06:47.517 --> 06:51.853
Well, it's too bad she's not local.
We could use her right about now.

06:54.256 --> 06:57.291
She's probably very
curious about you, too.

06:57.326 --> 07:02.030
Why would she be curious?
She doesn't even know I exist.

07:02.064 --> 07:05.300
Or maybe she does.
How can she not?

07:05.334 --> 07:07.936
She hasn't made any
effort to contact me.

07:09.938 --> 07:11.906
Okay, Maura, maybe she saw that

07:11.940 --> 07:16.044
and thinks Paddy was cheating
on her and had a kid named Maura.

07:16.078 --> 07:18.579
Or maybe she only reads
fancy french newspapers.

07:18.614 --> 07:23.118
Or maybe she hasn't thought of
Paddy Doyle in the past 36 years.

07:23.152 --> 07:25.287
Or me.

07:28.090 --> 07:29.958
- Wait a minute.
- No, don't.

07:29.992 --> 07:32.327
Oh my g...
she's moved back to Boston?

07:32.361 --> 07:34.996
Come on.
Maura, I don't believe in coincidences.

07:35.030 --> 07:36.297
This is meant to be.

07:36.331 --> 07:39.400
I'd be turning her world
upside down for what?

07:39.434 --> 07:43.137
So she can have you in her life, okay?

07:43.172 --> 07:45.639
Late is a million
times better than never.

07:45.674 --> 07:49.176
- Not if it causes her pain.
- Look at the pain you're in.

07:53.648 --> 07:55.049
I got a suspect upstairs.

07:55.083 --> 07:57.685
Come on. Do the autopsy, okay?
It'll make you feel better.

07:57.752 --> 08:00.020
Come on. Come on.
Come on. March.

08:03.759 --> 08:06.528
He won't come upstairs.
Says we can talk to him right here.

08:06.595 --> 08:10.231
- All right, let me try.
- He's all yours.

08:10.266 --> 08:11.600
Mr. Jaffe, thank you for coming.

08:11.634 --> 08:13.401
Look, if this is about
that parking ticket,

08:13.436 --> 08:14.703
what a waste of my tax dollars.

08:14.737 --> 08:17.505
- It's about your wife.
- What about Celia?

08:17.539 --> 08:22.143
- We believe she was murdered.
- Where were you last night?

08:22.178 --> 08:24.512
Where the hell do you think I was?

08:24.547 --> 08:28.182
Celia! Get over here!
Faster!

08:28.217 --> 08:29.651
Shut up.
You're gonna wake up the baby.

08:29.685 --> 08:31.986
Oh, now you decide to sleep.

08:32.020 --> 08:34.789
You see that? That's my wife.

08:37.092 --> 08:41.363
A woman was using your I.D.,
and we found her body.

08:41.397 --> 08:45.600
Oh, my god.
Oh, my wallet was stolen last week.

08:45.634 --> 08:49.404
- Your wallet was stolen?
- Shh! You will wake the baby.

08:49.438 --> 08:50.738
- Any idea where?
- No. I don't know.

08:50.772 --> 08:53.508
It could've been at the mall
or when I was going to get coffee.

08:53.542 --> 08:55.109
Going to the mall and getting lattes

08:55.144 --> 08:56.677
while I'm bustin' my
ass to support you ...

08:56.712 --> 09:00.147
- Shh! You'll wake the baby.
- But you didn't report it?

09:00.182 --> 09:03.317
You're driving around with no license?
With our insurance rates?

09:03.351 --> 09:06.687
Shut up, or I will arrest
you for baby wake-age.

09:06.722 --> 09:10.025
I haven't had time to go get a new one.

09:10.059 --> 09:13.228
Besides, whoever stole it ...
they sent it back to me in the mail.

09:13.262 --> 09:15.464
See? And ...
and everything was in it,

09:15.498 --> 09:18.667
- ...except for my driver's license.
- That's a good move, Celia.

09:18.701 --> 09:22.571
Yeah? 
Nice work, Rick.

09:22.605 --> 09:24.072
Come here.
It's okay. It's okay.

09:24.107 --> 09:27.176
Oh, my god.
I am never having kids.

09:29.412 --> 09:33.215
So, uh, sounds like our victim
was pretending to be somebody else.

09:33.250 --> 09:37.120
Mm. And hiding from someone
who apparently found her.

09:47.905 --> 09:51.674
So, our victim steals a wallet,
returns everything but the I.D., 

09:51.708 --> 09:54.677
assumes a new name,
and ends up dead in a dumpster.

09:54.711 --> 09:57.780
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

09:57.814 --> 10:00.883
- What's the matter?
- That's sister Winifred Callahan.

10:00.917 --> 10:02.251
<i>One there.</i>

10:02.285 --> 10:05.221
She's the meanest person I've
ever met in my entire life.

10:05.289 --> 10:09.292
<i>I see you hiding out there,
Jane Clementine Rizzoli.</i>

10:09.326 --> 10:11.528
Your middle name is Clementine?

10:13.765 --> 10:17.401
- Hello, sister Winifred.
- I never would've thought

10:17.435 --> 10:19.637
the girl who broke a
cafeteria window with her foot

10:19.671 --> 10:21.504
would be on this side of the law.

10:21.539 --> 10:24.307
I was 7.
I was trying to kill a fly.

10:24.342 --> 10:26.309
Remind me what I gave
you for comportment?

10:26.343 --> 10:28.811
Um...
C-minus.

10:28.845 --> 10:31.347
- What's comportment?
- Behavior.

10:31.381 --> 10:34.183
So, um...
what brings you here?

10:34.217 --> 10:38.186
"Um"? I have counted two ums
in 10 seconds, miss Rizzoli.

10:38.221 --> 10:40.755
It's...
Detective Rizzoli.

10:40.790 --> 10:44.559
I guess you don't read the
newsletter. Big surprise.

10:44.594 --> 10:47.262
I am here to do the Lord's work.

10:47.330 --> 10:49.797
Wow.
Awarded a federal grant

10:49.832 --> 10:53.301
to counsel families of homicide victims.

10:53.335 --> 10:54.902
No kidding. Here?

10:54.937 --> 10:58.739
I really would've preferred Cambridge,
but sister Helen-Marie got that grant.

11:01.909 --> 11:05.578
Well, I can't wait to catch up,
but I have to go to the morgue.

11:05.612 --> 11:07.880
I'll be holding my
breath for your return.

11:09.249 --> 11:11.017
Okay.

11:13.455 --> 11:15.722
They had to bring in "sister bitcher".

11:15.757 --> 11:18.225
"The Lord's work."
Yeah, that's what she said

11:18.260 --> 11:21.362
when she hit me with a ruler
because I misspelled "flamboyant."

11:21.396 --> 11:24.365
Why was the word "flamboyant"
on a second-grade spelling test

11:24.400 --> 11:27.235
- ...at a catholic school?
- I don't know.

11:27.269 --> 11:30.838
And no one's reported her missing.
Why not?

11:30.873 --> 11:33.508
Well, she has a
depressed skull fracture.

11:33.542 --> 11:34.876
Ugh.

11:34.910 --> 11:37.378
- Must've been a hefty weapon.
- Not a weapon.

11:37.412 --> 11:40.781
So she just woke up this morning,
and after she brushed her teeth,

11:40.816 --> 11:42.583
she thought,
"gee, my head hurts." ?

11:42.617 --> 11:45.352
No. She has contrecoup
contusion from a massive fall.

11:45.387 --> 11:47.955
- "Contrecoup" means ...
- Yeah, it's not my first rodeo.

11:47.990 --> 11:51.326
It means her head bounced
around inside her skull.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.728
- After striking a hard object.
- So not a pillow.

11:53.763 --> 11:55.664
It takes longer when you make jokes.

11:55.698 --> 11:59.401
I would poke out my eyes out with
a scalpel i f I didn't make jokes.

11:59.435 --> 12:00.769
Sister Winnie is scary.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.572
Oh, don't call her "Winnie."
I got two weeks in detention for that.

12:04.708 --> 12:08.644
Could also be because
I was singing, "Winnie the poop."

12:10.514 --> 12:12.815
Oh! Oh, I might have something.

12:12.849 --> 12:15.718
Her fourth digit isn't as
badly burned as the others.

12:15.753 --> 12:17.821
Might be able to try
a rehydration technique.

12:17.855 --> 12:19.789
You can get a print off of that?

12:21.025 --> 12:22.659
It looks like a charred tootsie roll.

12:22.693 --> 12:25.929
I've never done it.
I've only read about it in...

12:25.963 --> 12:31.301
An article published
by a Dr. Hope Martin.

12:31.335 --> 12:33.303
Well, perhaps we should
call Dr. Hope Martin.

12:33.337 --> 12:35.572
No!

12:35.606 --> 12:38.041
I ...
I'll just try myself.

12:41.412 --> 12:43.446
Well, Doc, you're not gonna ...

12:43.481 --> 12:45.582
You are.

12:45.616 --> 12:50.320
You have to detach the finger
in order to rehydrate the tissue.

12:50.954 --> 12:52.355
Frost?

12:54.625 --> 12:57.828
- Tying my shoe.
- Your shoes don't have laces.

12:58.963 --> 13:02.333
Oh, my gosh.
Detective Frost?

13:02.767 --> 13:04.502
I think he passed out.

13:12.644 --> 13:14.779
A student gave me this.

13:16.748 --> 13:19.050
I think nuns are awesome.

13:23.723 --> 13:27.526
It's words like "awesome" that
have ruined a glorious language.

13:28.661 --> 13:30.929
Your coffee is bitter.

13:30.964 --> 13:32.698
I'm sorry.
Shall I make a fresh pot?

13:32.732 --> 13:35.101
Don't bother.
It would probably be bitter, too.

13:35.168 --> 13:37.370
Would you like some cream and sugar?

13:37.404 --> 13:39.739
Nope. Hate to get used to anything
in case there's a shortage.

13:39.773 --> 13:43.743
What am I gonna do with my files?
I need a great, big cabinet.

13:43.777 --> 13:45.144
These police files?

13:45.179 --> 13:46.980
The families of the victims
you'll be counseling?

13:47.014 --> 13:49.582
These are my internal
files for the hell-raisers.

13:51.085 --> 13:54.054
Jane was a hell-raiser?

13:54.088 --> 13:56.389
Jane Rizzoli didn't like
to be told what to do.

13:56.424 --> 13:57.657
Well, that's still true.

13:57.692 --> 13:59.726
You think that's funny?

13:59.761 --> 14:02.528
So, that's all we know so far?

14:02.563 --> 14:07.067
Hello, Francesco.
Uh, hi, sister.

14:08.035 --> 14:09.869
Fran...  your real
name is Francesco?

14:09.904 --> 14:11.498
Yeah.
You got a problem with that?

14:11.563 --> 14:14.507
I prefer to call people
by their given names.

14:14.542 --> 14:16.409
Their parents went to a lot of trouble.

14:16.443 --> 14:17.944
What is your full name, young man?

14:20.114 --> 14:22.416
- Speak up!
- It's Barold.

14:22.450 --> 14:23.817
Barold!

14:24.653 --> 14:25.686
Ow.

14:25.720 --> 14:27.488
"Barold" means "spear."

14:27.522 --> 14:31.825
It's a very substantial name.
Wear it proudly, Barold.

14:33.628 --> 14:35.195
Uh, listen, sister,
we've got a young woman,

14:35.229 --> 14:38.165
a Jane Doe down in the morgue.
We really have to get back to work.

14:38.199 --> 14:39.866
Am I keeping you?

14:41.502 --> 14:42.803
Okay.

14:42.837 --> 14:46.773
Shouldn't a crime-lab
tech be doing this?

14:46.807 --> 14:50.810
No. Stop criticizing.
I tried potassium chloride,

14:50.845 --> 14:53.814
but it was too destructive
to the friction ridge skin.

14:53.848 --> 14:55.583
You only got one finger.

14:55.617 --> 14:57.551
What is that supposed to mean?

14:57.586 --> 14:58.986
It means you can't screw it up.

14:59.021 --> 15:01.656
So maybe you call Hope to do this.

15:01.690 --> 15:04.159
I also only have only
one biological mother,

15:04.193 --> 15:06.228
and I'd rather not screw that up.

15:06.262 --> 15:10.199
Damn! The ruffer rehydration method
modified by walker isn't working.

15:10.233 --> 15:12.134
- You don't know how to do it.
- Yes, I do.

15:12.168 --> 15:15.037
No, you don't. Look, you said
you wanted to know her, okay?

15:15.071 --> 15:18.040
Meet her on a level playing field.
Meet her as a colleague.

15:18.074 --> 15:20.876
Maura, I got to find
out who this woman is.

15:23.914 --> 15:26.149
Who are you calling?

15:26.183 --> 15:27.150
Dr. Pike. He'll help.

15:27.185 --> 15:30.220
No. No.
Don't you dare call that knucklehead.

15:30.254 --> 15:33.690
Maura, just face whatever
it is that's terrifying you.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.158
Face her.

15:35.193 --> 15:38.962
This is the easiest way.

15:42.033 --> 15:43.667
- Okay.
- Okay?

15:43.701 --> 15:48.738
Okay.
Okay. I'm going to do it.

15:48.805 --> 15:51.040
I am going to call her now.

15:51.075 --> 15:54.177
- Like "now" now?
- Yes. Before I lose my nerve.

15:54.211 --> 15:56.980
- Okay, don't you want to...
- No, no. No. I am perfectly calm.

15:57.015 --> 15:58.649
I'm Dr. Maura Isles,

15:58.683 --> 15:59.983
the chief medical examiner
of the Commonwealth ...

16:00.017 --> 16:01.919
<i>Dr. Martin.</i>

16:01.953 --> 16:05.522
<i>Hello? Is someone there?
Hello?</i>

16:05.556 --> 16:07.657
No. You have to do it.

16:07.692 --> 16:09.593
<i>Is someone there? Hello?</i>

16:09.627 --> 16:12.896
Hi. I am calling from the
office of Dr. Maura Isles,

16:12.930 --> 16:15.699
the Chief medical examiner for
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

16:15.733 --> 16:17.100
Could you hold for her, please?

16:18.036 --> 16:19.936
I can't. I can't.

16:19.971 --> 16:21.238
<i>Hello?</i>

16:21.272 --> 16:25.076
Please. I'm so sorry.
I hate cellphones, don't you?

16:25.110 --> 16:27.611
Um, so, we ...
we are working on

16:27.646 --> 16:29.180
a very difficult homicide together.

16:29.214 --> 16:30.948
We're trying to identify a Jane Doe.

16:30.983 --> 16:33.951
Would you be willing to do a consult?

16:33.986 --> 16:35.953
Yes, half an hour would be fine.
Thank you so very much.

16:36.989 --> 16:39.557
A half an hour?
Are you out of your mind?

16:39.591 --> 16:41.592
You can do it.

16:41.627 --> 16:42.827
Yes, you can.

16:42.861 --> 16:43.894
No. You can do this.

16:50.452 --> 16:51.552
Is it too late to call in sick? 

16:51.587 --> 16:53.688
I don't think I can do this.
I can't.

16:53.722 --> 16:55.657
What? No.
Oh, my g...

16:55.691 --> 16:59.327
Ma, Cavanaugh is gonna kill you.
BPD hates Tom MacGregor.

16:59.395 --> 17:00.628
He's soft on crime.

17:00.663 --> 17:02.397
Well, he's hard on school-lunch reform.

17:02.431 --> 17:05.000
♪ Put some pepper, pepper, pepper ♪

17:05.067 --> 17:06.801
♪ on your poli, poli, politics... ♪

17:06.836 --> 17:08.537
Never do that again.

17:08.570 --> 17:11.339
You're funny and hot.
Hey, you ever decide you want to...

17:11.374 --> 17:12.406
You're first on the list.

17:13.576 --> 17:16.978
Honey, don't you want
to at least meet her?

17:17.012 --> 17:21.717
Well, obviously, I'm curious.
But I don't need a mother.

17:21.751 --> 17:23.285
I have a mother.

17:23.319 --> 17:26.454
What can I get you?
Have a coffee.

17:26.489 --> 17:28.957
Do you have any more of those
green-label organic beans?

17:28.992 --> 17:30.392
Of course.

17:30.426 --> 17:32.962
Make it extra hot
and 1% milk, not 2%.

17:32.996 --> 17:34.964
and flat with just a hint of foam.

17:34.998 --> 17:37.367
- And a spoon, please.
- No coffee stirrer?

17:37.401 --> 17:39.835
There's an aftertaste.

17:39.870 --> 17:42.671
Most coffee stir sticks are
made from 100% birch wood.

17:42.705 --> 17:45.307
There's no chemicals
or toxins or glazes.

17:45.341 --> 17:47.709
But the birch plant
is known to be bitter,

17:47.743 --> 17:50.512
thus the slightly unpleasant aftertaste.

17:50.546 --> 17:53.982
You must be Dr. Martin.
Hi. I'm detective Jane Rizzoli.

17:54.016 --> 17:56.684
<i>And I'm Angela.
I'm Jane's mom.</i>

17:56.719 --> 18:02.791
- And... this is Dr. Maura Isles.
- What a pleasure.

18:02.825 --> 18:04.993
I am flattered that you
would want a consult.

18:05.027 --> 18:08.964
I've tried so many formulas ...
Tetrodotoxin glucose, methylene ...

18:08.998 --> 18:10.565
Dr. Isles, are you all right?

18:10.600 --> 18:12.000
Why ...  because I'm
talking too much

18:12.035 --> 18:14.002
and talking too fast
and not making any sense?

18:14.037 --> 18:16.004
You're showing signs of urticaria.

18:16.038 --> 18:19.007
- Oh, you have hives.
- Oh, no! Oh, my gosh.

18:19.042 --> 18:20.542
Maura.

18:20.576 --> 18:23.011
That must be because you
ate, um, the brazil nuts.

18:23.046 --> 18:26.915
Yes. Dr. Isles, how many
times do we have to tell you

18:26.949 --> 18:29.451
to avoid brazil nuts?

18:29.485 --> 18:34.423
Could I get you a latte made
out out of the green-label beans?

18:34.491 --> 18:37.760
No, thank you. I would very
much like to see your victim.

18:37.794 --> 18:41.564
And I have a lot of work to
do upstairs, so I'm gonna go.

18:41.598 --> 18:43.099
Maura.

18:45.936 --> 18:47.770
Do you have your epipen?

18:49.473 --> 18:52.475
And I came up with this
rehydration technique

18:52.510 --> 18:55.779
because we were so desperate
to identify the bodies.

18:55.813 --> 18:57.982
After the genocide in Sarajevo.

18:58.016 --> 18:59.083
Yes.

18:59.117 --> 19:02.787
And then we had to use it again
to identify entire Kurdish families

19:02.821 --> 19:04.789
that were slaughtered by Saddam Hussein.

19:04.824 --> 19:08.861
So, what made you go from your
medical internship to Sarajevo?

19:08.895 --> 19:10.696
Maybe I was punishing myself.

19:10.730 --> 19:14.166
Maybe I didn't believe
that I could save people,

19:14.200 --> 19:17.570
but I knew that I could
speak for the dead.

19:21.574 --> 19:27.846
Well, I wish I could speak for her.
She's someone's daughter.

19:27.881 --> 19:33.085
That's what drives me.
Everyone is someone's child.

19:41.827 --> 19:47.164
You said you were punishing
yourself. For what?

19:47.199 --> 19:49.700
Something stupid that
I did when I was 18.

19:49.734 --> 19:54.605
I hope my daughter has better
judgment than I did then.

19:56.807 --> 19:58.175
What did you do?

19:58.209 --> 20:03.780
I got pregnant.
And the baby died at birth.

20:03.814 --> 20:06.615
It was terrible and traumatic.

20:06.650 --> 20:08.918
But maybe there was a reason
that she didn't survive.

20:08.952 --> 20:14.724
See, her father was... evil.

20:19.697 --> 20:23.901
I-I'm sorry. I didn't ...
I didn't mean to pry.

20:23.935 --> 20:27.704
I never talk about this.

20:30.175 --> 20:32.676
I spent so many years trying to forget.

20:32.711 --> 20:36.814
Maybe it's because you're a doctor.
I feel a strange kinship with you.

20:40.185 --> 20:41.518
Me too.

20:50.796 --> 20:53.631
For you.
For helping me change the future.

20:53.665 --> 20:55.633
Giovanni, you shouldn't have.

21:01.139 --> 21:05.609
- What were you thinking?!
- That you're hot.

21:05.644 --> 21:07.878
And May-December romances
are all the rage, Mrs. Rizz.

21:07.913 --> 21:10.047
I mean, you are such
a cougar. Meow!

21:10.082 --> 21:11.749
You come one step closer,

21:11.817 --> 21:15.888
and I'll be bringing your mother
your body parts in a pie tin!

21:15.922 --> 21:18.724
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rizz.
I'm sorry.

21:18.758 --> 21:21.694
I'm just kind of lonely.
I mean...

21:23.330 --> 21:24.930
I mean, I think I'm a catch.

21:24.965 --> 21:27.933
Why can't I find a girl who
understands all I got to offer?

21:27.968 --> 21:31.070
Do you come on this
strong to other girls?

21:31.104 --> 21:32.804
Well, stronger, usually.

21:32.839 --> 21:37.242
I mean, I was going easy on you
'cause you're, you know, old.

21:38.344 --> 21:40.645
Can I just get a mom hug?

21:41.881 --> 21:44.316
Come on.
Just one mom hug.

21:44.350 --> 21:46.184
Come on, Mrs. Rizz.
Come here.

21:46.219 --> 21:48.553
Oh.

21:48.588 --> 21:51.256
I friggin' love you, Mrs. Rizz.

21:51.291 --> 21:53.592
<i>Okay. Yeah.</i>

21:55.762 --> 21:56.962
Please tell me you're
seeing whorls and ridges.

21:56.996 --> 22:01.000
We are.
And there is excellent ridge detail.

22:01.034 --> 22:04.938
Okay, let me see if it scans.

22:06.140 --> 22:07.941
That's a good print.

22:07.975 --> 22:09.676
Well done, Doctors.

22:11.379 --> 22:12.746
Oh.

22:17.285 --> 22:18.719
Oh, my.

22:20.788 --> 22:24.591
She gets very emotional when
we break a case wide open.

22:24.625 --> 22:27.227
- Yes, I do.
- How lovely.

22:27.261 --> 22:28.261
Uh...

22:30.164 --> 22:32.232
Thank you.

22:32.266 --> 22:35.836
Well, I'm, uh, I'm sorry,
But I have to go pick up my daughter.

22:37.305 --> 22:38.605
Thank you so much, Dr. Martin.

22:38.639 --> 22:40.207
You are very welcome.

22:40.241 --> 22:44.979
Dr. Isles, I would very
much like to have lunch sometime.

22:45.013 --> 22:48.682
Of course.
You have my information.

22:50.051 --> 22:52.119
Let's make this sooner
rather than later.

22:52.153 --> 22:55.021
I really ...
really enjoyed it.

22:58.059 --> 23:01.128
Maura...
that was so beautiful!

23:01.162 --> 23:05.031
- When are you gonna tell her?
- Never.

23:05.066 --> 23:09.303
Never, ever. Never, ever.
Never, ever.

23:17.554 --> 23:19.155
<i> All right, gentlemen, turn left. </i>

23:19.190 --> 23:21.257
<i>Last desk on the right.</i>

23:21.325 --> 23:24.227
Come on, Francesco.
Move it along.

23:24.262 --> 23:25.228
Ow!

23:25.263 --> 23:26.663
What the hell is she doing?

23:26.698 --> 23:29.099
Making herself at home here in hell.

23:29.166 --> 23:31.534
Got it. Emma Spencer, 27.

23:31.569 --> 23:34.437
Holy crap.
She's a legal intern.

23:34.472 --> 23:36.038
She works at the district
attorney's office.

23:36.073 --> 23:38.707
Her prints are there because she
registered to take this year's bar exam.

23:38.742 --> 23:43.045
Got her DMV photo.
She looks just like Celia Jaffe.

23:43.079 --> 23:45.214
What the hell is she doing
stealing a new mother's wallet?

23:45.248 --> 23:47.082
How did somebody like
that end up in a dumpster

23:47.116 --> 23:48.650
and nobody reports her missing?

23:48.684 --> 23:50.752
Maybe one of the creeps the
D.A.'s office prosecuted?

23:50.786 --> 23:52.220
She'd only been there three months.

23:53.489 --> 23:56.725
I'm quitting. I can't take it.
I almost ran away in second grade

23:56.759 --> 23:58.593
when I got stuck with that ...
that ...

23:58.628 --> 24:02.398
- Sweet, kind, loving nun.
- I am so out of here.

24:02.432 --> 24:04.534
Aw. You gonna grab your
"Thomas the train" backpack

24:04.568 --> 24:07.604
and run away, Francesco?
Can I take him?

24:07.638 --> 24:10.073
- Take me where, Barold?
- To the D.A.'s office.

24:10.107 --> 24:11.741
We're gonna talk to our victim's boss.

24:11.776 --> 24:14.311
Oh, anything to stop
moving her furniture.

24:14.378 --> 24:17.213
Hey, Frankie, remember
Frost is the detective.

24:17.248 --> 24:19.282
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

24:19.317 --> 24:21.118
Barold?

24:24.523 --> 24:28.760
Emma's goal was to be assigned
to the sexual-assault team.

24:28.794 --> 24:31.596
Damn. This is just plain tragic.

24:31.630 --> 24:34.599
Sexual assault ...
that's a tough job.

24:34.634 --> 24:38.837
Yeah, but she was cut out for it.
She was very smart and tough.

24:38.872 --> 24:41.207
When was the last time that you saw her?

24:41.241 --> 24:43.242
Last week.
She asked for a week off.

24:43.277 --> 24:45.244
To study for the bar?

24:45.278 --> 24:47.580
No, actually, she said
she had a family emergency.

24:47.614 --> 24:49.797
- This her boyfriend?
- That's her brother.

24:49.861 --> 24:51.851
I just assumed that
something happened to him.

24:51.885 --> 24:54.520
They're very close.
They shared an apartment.

24:54.554 --> 24:58.491
She didn't have any other family
or a boyfriend, as far as I know.

24:58.525 --> 25:01.260
Was she being stalked?
Maybe somebody threatening her?

25:01.294 --> 25:03.729
No, I can't imagine that.
I think she would have told me.

25:03.764 --> 25:07.399
She was always
professional and upbeat ...

25:07.434 --> 25:10.048
until the day that she
asked for some time off.

25:10.130 --> 25:12.502
She seemed so down.

25:12.503 --> 25:14.874
I just wish I knew why.

25:15.209 --> 25:16.876
Oh, excuse me.

25:16.910 --> 25:20.145
I'm gonna have to take this.
I have a trial going on.

25:20.180 --> 25:22.181
<i>Devere.</i>

25:23.650 --> 25:25.383
So, you, uh, want to go
hang with sister Winifred

25:25.451 --> 25:26.784
and say the rosary, Francesco,

25:26.819 --> 25:28.686
Or come with me to
interview the brother?

25:28.721 --> 25:31.556
You ever ask your mom why she
named you "Barold," Barold?

25:31.590 --> 25:34.425
Okay, let's just stop.

25:34.459 --> 25:36.660
Let's stop.

25:42.566 --> 25:45.902
She said she was studying for the bar.

25:45.936 --> 25:49.872
- She took off last week.
- Do you know where she went?

25:49.907 --> 25:54.211
No. She just said she needed
to hunker down and study.

25:54.245 --> 25:58.215
She took her computer and one bag.

25:58.249 --> 26:00.484
We'd like to look
through your apartment.

26:00.518 --> 26:02.386
Yeah, you can ...  you can
look through anything.

26:02.420 --> 26:05.323
When was the last time
you heard from your sister?

26:05.357 --> 26:06.857
Every day.

26:06.892 --> 26:11.196
She ...
she sent me an e-mail.

26:11.230 --> 26:13.765
Said she was tired, but ...
but ...  but good.

26:13.799 --> 26:16.601
You can ...  you can look
through my account, too.

26:18.437 --> 26:21.240
She was my only family.

26:22.843 --> 26:26.513
I'm really sorry for your loss.

26:32.921 --> 26:34.255
Sit up straight.

26:36.358 --> 26:40.362
Didn't find Emma's computer ...
or anything else in her apartment.

26:40.396 --> 26:41.896
That's too bad.

26:41.931 --> 26:44.232
I'm gonna go through the
server at the D.A.'s office

26:44.267 --> 26:45.967
and track Emma's correspondence.

26:50.940 --> 26:52.707
Would you like a cough drop, sister?

26:52.742 --> 26:54.977
It sounds like you have
some phlegm in your throat.

26:55.011 --> 26:57.946
I was thinking you might want to
thank the Lord for that sandwich.

26:57.981 --> 26:59.414
Thank you...

26:59.449 --> 27:01.917
for my peanut-butter-and-fluff
sandwich.

27:01.952 --> 27:06.322
Although I wish it had more
peanut butter and less fluff.

27:08.492 --> 27:10.293
Hmm.

27:10.327 --> 27:12.262
Emma was sending e-mail from
the building where she worked,

27:12.296 --> 27:13.997
but she wasn't sending
it from her office.

27:14.065 --> 27:17.667
Where was she sending it from?

27:17.701 --> 27:19.569
The I.P. Address is
from an unassigned office

27:19.603 --> 27:20.837
in the courthouse basement.

27:23.574 --> 27:27.777
Whoa.
What did we stumble on?

27:27.811 --> 27:29.612
Looks like the lair of a serial killer.

27:31.647 --> 27:35.285
Frost, Emma was
investigating a cold case ...

27:35.320 --> 27:37.621
a 17-year-old who
disappeared 10 years ago.

27:37.655 --> 27:39.556
Her remains were found last week.

27:39.591 --> 27:41.825
"The body of Isabelle Dubois, 17,

27:41.860 --> 27:45.663
was discovered when a family
was cleaning out a vacant home."

27:45.697 --> 27:47.898
Listen to this from 10 years ago.

27:47.933 --> 27:52.737
"Emma Spencer, also 17,
told police Isabelle, her best friend,

27:52.771 --> 27:56.040
failed to show up for
a planned sleep over."

27:56.074 --> 27:58.776
Best friends ...
Emma and Isabelle.

27:58.810 --> 28:00.711
Man, they did everything together.

28:02.580 --> 28:05.315
Emma must have used her
new job at the D.A.'s office

28:05.349 --> 28:08.685
to get this copy of
Isabelle's autopsy report.

28:08.720 --> 28:10.987
She's even got the photos.

28:14.592 --> 28:17.727
This is a note from Isabelle to Emma.

28:17.762 --> 28:19.329
It was written the day she disappeared.

28:19.363 --> 28:21.865
"He says he'll be my
'Knight in shining armor.'

28:21.899 --> 28:23.033
Gag me with a spoon.

28:23.067 --> 28:26.603
but I'm going tonight. I'll be fine.
Love, Izzie."

28:26.637 --> 28:28.071
She wasn't fine.

28:28.105 --> 28:29.939
It's the oldest teenage-girl
trick in the book.

28:29.974 --> 28:32.842
Emma covers for Isabelle,
says they're having a sleep over.

28:32.877 --> 28:34.010
Cost Isabelle her life.

28:36.380 --> 28:38.514
I think this is a lair of guilt.

28:38.549 --> 28:42.018
You know, I'm gonna have Maura
look at Isabelle's remains.

28:42.052 --> 28:44.921
That body is 10 years old.

28:44.955 --> 28:46.389
Maybe Emma found something

28:46.423 --> 28:47.991
the Worcester M.E.'s office missed.

29:01.771 --> 29:06.140
She was asphyxiated and has
quite a bit of adipocere tissue. 

29:06.175 --> 29:08.509
I hate soap mummies.

29:08.544 --> 29:12.513
Okay, it says here there's an
abnormality to Isabelle's left cheekbone.

29:12.548 --> 29:14.648
It's an injury, not an abnormality.

29:14.683 --> 29:16.884
That's why Pike is still in Worcester.

29:16.918 --> 29:19.620
You see the tool marks
on her zygomatic bone?

29:19.688 --> 29:20.921
On her cheekbone?

29:20.955 --> 29:26.026
Yeah, those three round indentations
with scalloped edges.

29:26.060 --> 29:28.729
- What is that from?
- It's a very strange pattern.

29:28.763 --> 29:30.931
Isabelle was struck with
something hard enough

29:30.965 --> 29:33.734
to break the skin
and pierce the bone.

29:33.768 --> 29:38.472
Well, Korsak's looking at
what's left of Isabelle's clothing.

29:38.506 --> 29:40.374
You said the body was found
in an old lady's basement.

29:40.408 --> 29:41.475
Did the old lady kill her?

29:41.542 --> 29:44.177
- Mm. It's doubtful.
- Doubtful?

29:44.212 --> 29:45.579
- So she might have?
- No.

29:45.613 --> 29:47.147
Then why did you say "doubtful"?

29:47.181 --> 29:49.715
I just wanted you to know
what uncertainty felt like.

29:52.152 --> 29:55.422
Oh, my g...
Maura, I didn't mean it ...

29:55.456 --> 29:58.625
Oh. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

29:58.659 --> 30:00.927
Everything makes me cry.

30:02.230 --> 30:04.197
Adipocere tissue never makes me cry.

30:05.733 --> 30:09.035
My mother said it was
better that I didn't live.

30:10.504 --> 30:13.106
Okay, now you're being
ridiculous. She did not say that.

30:13.140 --> 30:15.174
She said it was traumatic, right?

30:15.208 --> 30:19.478
Which means that it makes her sad.
She doesn't want to dwell on it.

30:19.513 --> 30:22.982
I just don't ever want her
to know that I'm that evil child.

30:24.484 --> 30:25.851
Here. Blow.

30:27.087 --> 30:31.858
- Everything okay?
- Allergies. She ate brazil nuts.

30:31.892 --> 30:34.627
Oh. We're doing good
in there. Look at this.

30:34.661 --> 30:38.231
Found this metal ring in her blouse.
See this piece of her jeans?

30:38.265 --> 30:39.866
- Yeah, you think that's semen?
- Tested positive.

30:39.900 --> 30:42.168
I'm running it right now.

30:42.203 --> 30:44.937
Oh, my god.

30:44.971 --> 30:48.741
I was just picking up my
residential parking permit upstairs.

30:48.776 --> 30:52.879
- I hope it's okay.
- Yes, yes. It's fine. Yeah.

30:52.914 --> 30:54.682
Uh, we were just breaking another case.

30:54.716 --> 30:56.750
Terrific.
I stopped in because I ...

30:56.785 --> 31:00.087
Well, I wanted to know if
you were able to identify her.

31:00.122 --> 31:01.155
We were.

31:01.190 --> 31:06.695
Soap mummy?
Looks to be about 10 years old.

31:06.729 --> 31:09.131
Yes.
You're amazing.

31:09.165 --> 31:12.801
Got something big, Jane.
I tracked all of Emma's e-mail.

31:12.836 --> 31:14.736
She took a leave of absence
to try to get another job.

31:14.804 --> 31:15.904
What? Where?

31:15.939 --> 31:17.506
You're not gonna believe this.

31:17.540 --> 31:19.708
She was applying to the
"No Cares Au Pair" agency.

31:19.743 --> 31:22.311
- To do what?
- To be a nanny.

31:25.182 --> 31:26.983
You recognize this woman?

31:27.017 --> 31:29.986
I know all my employees.
That's Celia Jaffe.

31:30.021 --> 31:33.790
Actually, that's Emma Spencer.
Celia Jaffe was her alias.

31:33.825 --> 31:38.529
That's not possible.
We always run a thorough,

31:38.564 --> 31:41.666
multi-step background
check on everyone.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.101
Did you do the thorough,

31:43.135 --> 31:44.569
multi-step background
check on this employee?

31:44.603 --> 31:48.239
- Well, we checked her driving record.
- So that's a no.

31:51.143 --> 31:53.944
She came in to interview
in the middle of a crisis.

31:53.979 --> 31:56.947
A-a very prominent client
had just fired their nanny

31:56.982 --> 31:59.117
and needed an immediate replacement.

31:59.151 --> 32:01.085
Emma was the perfect replacement?

32:01.119 --> 32:03.320
She had very hard-to-find skills.

32:03.355 --> 32:07.757
She was willing to live in,
spoke fluent French, well-educated.

32:08.792 --> 32:12.228
- Who was the client?
- I can't divulge that.

32:12.263 --> 32:14.930
Well, that's too bad...
since it might be your last

32:14.965 --> 32:16.599
when word gets out that
you don't vet your nannies.

32:20.737 --> 32:22.271
It was Tom MacGregor and his wife.

32:22.305 --> 32:24.272
Tom MacGregor Jr., the one
who's running for congress?

32:24.307 --> 32:26.775
You understand the need for discretion.

32:26.810 --> 32:27.977
Oh, we do.

32:28.011 --> 32:29.879
It seems awfully coincidental

32:29.913 --> 32:31.714
that the MacGregors
had to fire their nanny

32:31.748 --> 32:33.883
the same day that Emma Spencer
came in for an interview.

32:33.917 --> 32:36.886
The MacGregors received
an anonymous phone call

32:36.921 --> 32:38.354
saying that their nanny,

32:38.389 --> 32:41.124
who is 60 and someone
I certainly did vet,

32:41.159 --> 32:42.893
was selling crack cocaine.

32:44.829 --> 32:48.831
- I guess you never know.
- Guess you never do.

32:53.304 --> 32:56.039
<i> Move that over.</i>

32:56.274 --> 32:59.243
That anonymous phone call reporting
Mary Poppins, the crack dealer ...

32:59.277 --> 33:00.277
it came from Emma Spencer.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.945
Yeah, of course it did.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.781
How else was Emma gonna get
into the MacGregor fortress?

33:03.815 --> 33:05.282
She was looking for something.

33:05.317 --> 33:08.085
Yeah, something to connect
MacGregor to Isabelle's murder.

33:08.120 --> 33:11.226
I'll grab Korsak, do an initial interview
with MacGregor before he lawyers up.

33:11.342 --> 33:13.758
See what he says when I show
him Isabelle and Emma's photos.

33:13.792 --> 33:15.693
Okay, I'll push the crime
lab on the DNA processing.

33:15.727 --> 33:19.430
Thank you for keeping the
streets safe from crime, Barold.

33:21.700 --> 33:26.036
Um, we have a cleaning staff, you know.

33:26.071 --> 33:30.074
Apparently, you have forgotten
the "tidy desk, tidy minds" song.

33:31.277 --> 33:33.712
♪ Tidy 'round your desk and chair ♪

33:33.746 --> 33:36.448
♪ tidy, tidy everywhere ♪

33:37.818 --> 33:42.455
♪ tidy farts and wide-ee butts,
I can see your underwear. ♪

33:48.229 --> 33:51.798
So, she likes Montepulciano,
Lebanese Yucchini, and science fiction.

33:51.832 --> 33:53.333
She's a soap mummy.

33:53.367 --> 33:56.269
No. Uh, Hope.
My, uh...

33:56.304 --> 33:57.337
My new friend.

33:57.371 --> 33:59.272
Aw, that's wonderful, Maura.

33:59.307 --> 34:02.075
And she said she'd call me once
she's settled into her new home.

34:02.109 --> 34:05.212
Ooh, I was hoping those
are the DNA results.

34:05.246 --> 34:07.948
Not yet.
It's Isabelle's tox screen.

34:07.982 --> 34:09.416
There were traces of
Rohypnol in her system.

34:09.451 --> 34:14.088
Roofies. The date-rape drug.

34:14.156 --> 34:16.724
Maybe Isabelle was raped,
and that's why she was murdered.

34:23.099 --> 34:26.301
- Would you ever wear a skirt, Frost?
- Where is this going?

34:26.335 --> 34:28.069
<i> Hello, gentlemen.</i>

34:28.103 --> 34:29.237
Great to have you here.

34:29.271 --> 34:31.739
Is the Detectives union endorsing me?

34:31.774 --> 34:34.909
Uh, not exactly.
Do you know this woman?

34:34.944 --> 34:36.411
Yeah, of course. That's Celia.

34:36.446 --> 34:38.847
We hired her to take
care of our 6-year-old.

34:38.880 --> 34:40.949
She must not have
liked it here very much.

34:41.016 --> 34:42.851
She left after ...
was it two days?

34:42.885 --> 34:44.319
Yes. Monday to Wednesday.

34:44.353 --> 34:46.722
By Thursday morning, she'd
packed up and disappeared.

34:46.755 --> 34:48.123
What's this about?

34:48.190 --> 34:50.425
Mr. MacGregor has another
speaking engagement in 30 minutes.

34:50.458 --> 34:54.395
- We're investigating her murder.
- God.

34:54.429 --> 34:58.098
If I may ...
this is a terrible tragedy,

34:58.133 --> 35:02.002
but Mr. MacGregor
hardly knew Ms. Jaffe.

35:02.036 --> 35:03.970
I'm more concerned about my daughter.

35:04.038 --> 35:08.107
Celia wasn't here very long,
but Gracie really liked her.

35:08.142 --> 35:10.876
Her name wasn't Celia.
It was Emma Spencer.

35:10.911 --> 35:14.280
She was a recent law-school graduate
who was working in the D.A.'s office.

35:14.314 --> 35:16.415
What was she doing working as our nanny?

35:16.449 --> 35:19.518
- We don't know.
- Oh, I think I do.

35:19.553 --> 35:22.288
Another dirty campaign maneuver,
courtesy of your opponent.

35:24.124 --> 35:25.991
Do you know this woman?

35:26.059 --> 35:29.261
- No.
- Who is she?

35:33.833 --> 35:36.902
This is from primitive steel.
It has a good deal of slag in it.

35:36.936 --> 35:40.272
Remind me why I care about slag
and get to the hunch part.

35:40.307 --> 35:42.941
Well, the last time this
type of steel was manufactured

35:42.976 --> 35:44.310
was in the 15th century.

35:45.378 --> 35:48.980
That's a gauntlet from a post-medieval
Scottish knight's suit of armor.

35:49.015 --> 35:50.315
Let me see this petri dish.

35:50.349 --> 35:52.784
You think that this ring
could be from chain mail

35:52.818 --> 35:54.052
from a suit of armor?

35:54.086 --> 35:55.420
I think it might be from a gauntlet.

35:55.454 --> 35:56.988
Isabelle's cheek ...

35:57.022 --> 36:00.057
You're saying the murderer was
wearing the gauntlet when he hit her?

36:00.092 --> 36:02.092
These are the DNA results.

36:02.127 --> 36:04.929
Oh. Hmm...
which Boston family would have

36:04.963 --> 36:07.465
a scottish post-medieval suit
of armor and need a nanny?

36:07.500 --> 36:11.369
Wait. I'm putting
my thinking cap on.  Mm.

36:11.404 --> 36:12.871
Does the dna belong to Tom MacGregor?

36:12.905 --> 36:14.239
How did you know?

36:14.273 --> 36:18.310
Because I'm amazing, too.

36:22.778 --> 36:24.445
What's up, Jane? 

36:24.480 --> 36:27.349
Hey, Korsak, you see a suit of
armor anywhere in that house?

36:27.583 --> 36:29.084
I do. At the top of the stairs.

36:29.118 --> 36:30.986
All right, I'm getting you a warrant.
Bring it back.

36:31.021 --> 36:33.555
All right.

36:37.159 --> 36:39.428
These are the last of the
boxes from Emma's lair.

36:39.462 --> 36:40.829
I'll take these. You take those.

36:40.864 --> 36:44.967
- Maura, come on. Yes or no?
- 1.5 centimeters.

36:48.238 --> 36:49.805
Well, a gauntlet like this

36:49.840 --> 36:52.007
made the tool marks on
Isabelle Dubois' cheekbone.

36:52.075 --> 36:53.141
"A gauntlet like this"?

36:53.176 --> 36:55.844
How many 16th-century gauntlets
are just laying around?

36:55.878 --> 36:56.845
That's my job.

36:56.879 --> 36:59.581
You're taking too long!
I want to know if there's blood.

36:59.616 --> 37:01.983
- That's blood.
- Found something.

37:04.153 --> 37:07.589
Isabelle and Emma knew Tom MacGregor's
campaign manager, Dan Hargrove.

37:07.623 --> 37:11.092
They were campers together,
and Dan was their counselor.

37:11.127 --> 37:12.861
Okay, here's a theory.

37:12.895 --> 37:15.864
Dan introduces Isabelle to
his friend, Tom MacGregor.

37:15.899 --> 37:18.467
Oh, can I try?
What? You just did my test.

37:18.502 --> 37:21.738
- It's guessing. You'll get hives.
- It's theorizing.

37:21.772 --> 37:24.941
Tom MacGregor gives Isabelle
Rohypnol and he rapes her.

37:24.975 --> 37:28.611
She feels the effects of the drug
and tries getting away.

37:28.645 --> 37:30.079
I will raise your theory.

37:30.113 --> 37:32.548
He backhands her with
the gauntlet so hard,

37:32.582 --> 37:35.151
it splits her face open,
then panics, strangles her,

37:35.185 --> 37:37.754
and calls Dan the fixer
to get rid of the body.

37:37.788 --> 37:40.223
I'll match and double.
Isabelle's body turns up.

37:40.258 --> 37:43.160
Emma's got a problem because she
lied to the police 10 years before.

37:43.194 --> 37:44.161
Zero credibility.

37:44.195 --> 37:46.797
Has to find another way
to get justice for her dead friend.

37:46.832 --> 37:48.199
Publicly humiliate Tom MacGregor.

37:48.233 --> 37:50.768
Could Emma have figured
out from these photos

37:50.802 --> 37:53.037
that Isabelle was struck
with that gauntlet?

37:53.071 --> 37:55.839
Well, if we're still
playing "theory," yes.

37:55.874 --> 37:59.510
That's what she was doing in the house.
She was looking for the gauntlet.

38:00.344 --> 38:01.778
Dr. Isles, do you see something?

38:01.813 --> 38:05.917
I do.
Arm hair caught in the chain mail.

38:05.951 --> 38:08.152
Let's get it processed.

38:13.058 --> 38:15.059
Okay, how 'bout we
start by you telling me

38:15.094 --> 38:17.863
when my family's antique suit
of armor is gonna be returned?

38:17.897 --> 38:22.034
Just so we're clear,
neither one of you know her.

38:22.069 --> 38:24.537
Let me handle this, Tom.
No.

38:24.571 --> 38:27.740
And you'd never met her before
she came here to work as a nanny.

38:27.774 --> 38:29.776
We've been through this. No.

38:29.810 --> 38:31.245
That's weird.

38:31.279 --> 38:33.547
Seems like you'd know
the names of your campers.

38:33.581 --> 38:35.582
You spent three weeks with them.

38:35.617 --> 38:37.551
What the hell?

38:37.585 --> 38:41.088
Isabelle wrote this
note the night she disappeared.

38:41.123 --> 38:44.225
"He says he'll be my
'Knight in shining armor.'

38:44.259 --> 38:47.228
Gag me with a spoon.
But I'm going tonight."

38:47.262 --> 38:48.863
She was coming here, wasn't she, Tom?

38:48.897 --> 38:51.165
Don't answer that.
I'm calling your lawyer.

38:51.200 --> 38:52.767
Might want to call yours, too.

38:52.801 --> 38:57.238
We thought you were the desperate guy
who wanted to be Isabelle's knight.

38:57.272 --> 38:58.573
But it was you.

38:58.607 --> 39:02.243
We found traces of Rohypnol
in Isabelle's remains.

39:02.277 --> 39:03.778
You slipped her a roofie.

39:03.812 --> 39:07.014
And then you strangled her because
she liked Tom more than you.

39:07.049 --> 39:08.716
You probably roofied Tom, too.

39:08.751 --> 39:10.785
Tom...

39:10.819 --> 39:12.854
That's why I woke up
next to a dead girl.

39:12.888 --> 39:14.589
Tom...

39:14.623 --> 39:15.990
You let me think I did
that, you son of a ...

39:16.025 --> 39:17.225
Hey, hey! Relax!

39:17.259 --> 39:20.161
I don't know what you're talking about.
You can't prove any of this.

39:20.195 --> 39:21.963
We can prove you knew both
of them and lied about it.

39:21.997 --> 39:24.265
I'm pretty sure we can prove
you were wearing that gauntlet

39:24.300 --> 39:27.735
when you struck Isabelle.
So...

39:27.770 --> 39:31.339
Was Emma trying to get the gauntlet
when you pushed her down the stairs?

39:31.374 --> 39:34.877
I mean, she could trust you, right?
You were her old camp counselor.

39:34.911 --> 39:36.879
You'd help her get justice.

39:36.913 --> 39:39.715
- Here, Jane.
- That's blood.

39:39.750 --> 39:41.284
And you're under arrest
for the murder ...

39:41.318 --> 39:42.752
Where are you going, huh?

39:42.787 --> 39:46.857
You are under arrest for the murders
of Emma Spencer and Isabelle Dubois.

39:46.924 --> 39:47.991
Put your hands behind your back.

39:48.025 --> 39:51.028
- I'm innocent.
- You're an accessory after the fact.

39:51.062 --> 39:52.729
Maybe you should have said something

39:52.764 --> 39:54.765
instead of helping Dan
get rid of Isabelle's body.

39:54.799 --> 39:56.767
Looks like the campaign's over, boys.

39:56.801 --> 39:58.301
Come on. Let's go.

40:08.879 --> 40:12.315
Oh, should we join her?
She's sitting by herself.

40:12.349 --> 40:15.818
There's a reason I'm by myself.
I prefer it.

40:18.722 --> 40:22.025
Well, they say the
Devil never drinks alone.

40:22.059 --> 40:23.292
<i>Jane.</i>

40:23.327 --> 40:26.730
- Can I buy you a beer, sister?
- No, thank you, miss Rizzoli.

40:35.875 --> 40:39.176
"The sound and the fury" by Faulkner.

40:39.663 --> 40:41.235
I'm enjoying it.

40:44.450 --> 40:48.052
"On the angel's wings of desire."

40:48.087 --> 40:50.021
Are nuns supposed to read that?

40:53.492 --> 40:55.993
- Hey.
- What's the matter?

40:56.028 --> 40:59.230
- Nothing.
- You look hot.

41:00.399 --> 41:01.766
No, I don't.

41:01.801 --> 41:03.868
Are you having a pity party, "G"?

41:05.404 --> 41:10.175
Do you ...  do you want
company for your pity party?

41:10.209 --> 41:11.276
Come on.

41:13.880 --> 41:19.051
- Sorry about your candidate.
- Yeah. Me too.

41:19.085 --> 41:22.321
Guess I'll have to run myself
if I want any changes around here.

41:24.091 --> 41:26.259
Oh, that's ...
that's a good idea...

41:26.293 --> 41:28.794
Yeah.
Why stop at congressman?

41:28.828 --> 41:32.330
- Why not senator?
- President?

41:33.833 --> 41:37.202
Why not?
Think of all the interns.

41:37.236 --> 41:41.106
<i>- Skirts optional.
- That'd be nice.</i>
