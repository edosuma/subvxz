00:04.269 --> 00:06.703
Hey, what are you doing
with Mom and Dad's dog?

00:06.772 --> 00:09.306
Oh, they left for their
cruise this week, so they asked

00:09.374 --> 00:10.607
me to take care of Dicka.

00:10.675 --> 00:12.076
You know, it's Ditka, Taco.

00:12.144 --> 00:13.242
And why wouldn't Mom and Dad ask me?

00:13.358 --> 00:15.559
Because I'm the responsible one?

00:15.626 --> 00:16.327
Right.

00:17.162 --> 00:18.762
What's up with the dog?

00:18.830 --> 00:21.065
I didn't know you and Jenny
were still having sex.

00:21.132 --> 00:23.968
Excuse me. We do.

00:24.035 --> 00:27.838
This morning, but are you looking
through our window again, Taco?

00:27.905 --> 00:29.840
No, he's conditioned to
bark at the smell of sex.

00:29.907 --> 00:30.474
Conditioned?

00:30.541 --> 00:33.810
After I have sex, I'm in a good
mood, so I toss the dog a treat.

00:33.878 --> 00:35.612
So now it knows the smell of sex.

00:35.680 --> 00:37.314
You only had the dog for a week.

00:37.382 --> 00:38.582
How much sex did you have?

00:38.649 --> 00:40.817
Normal amount.

00:40.885 --> 00:45.339
Whoa. She started you
off with an HJ, huh?

00:45.865 --> 00:49.008
Classic. Classic Jenny.

00:49.128 --> 00:53.687

00:53.807 --> 00:55.932
Hello. Can I help you find something?

00:56.001 --> 00:58.835
Yes. As you may have
noticed, you know, I'm a pretty

00:58.903 --> 01:03.440
athletic person, and I've decided I'm
gonna get back in shape, so I am looking

01:03.508 --> 01:05.942
for a high-performance shoe.

01:06.011 --> 01:07.944
You are looking for Vapora.

01:08.013 --> 01:11.315
It's a brand-new, high-end running
shoe that comes in two styles.

01:11.383 --> 01:11.948
Mm-hmm.

01:12.017 --> 01:13.183
One is the Vapora Casual.

01:13.251 --> 01:16.720
As you can see, it's got sort of a light tread...
Let me stop you right

01:16.787 --> 01:17.621
there, okay?

01:17.688 --> 01:22.026
There's nothing casual about the way
I'm gonna be exercising and training.

01:22.093 --> 01:24.028
You're gonna want the Vapora Sport.

01:24.095 --> 01:25.329
I like the sound of that.

01:25.397 --> 01:26.563
Look at this tread.

01:26.631 --> 01:28.198
Good treads, it's
lightweight, supportive.

01:28.266 --> 01:30.634
I think these shoes can take
what I'm gonna be dishing out.

01:30.701 --> 01:31.868
It's a great choice for you.

01:31.936 --> 01:34.238
I mean, the Casuals over here,
let me just tell you, they're

01:34.305 --> 01:35.172
like a house slipper.

01:35.240 --> 01:36.206
All right, man, I'm in.

01:36.274 --> 01:37.141
Just one last question.

01:37.208 --> 01:38.808
Got 'em in a ten and a half?

01:38.876 --> 01:39.876
It's your lucky day.

01:39.944 --> 01:43.013
This is a ten and a half right
here, and this is the last pair

01:43.081 --> 01:44.415
of Vapora Sports in the whole store.

01:44.482 --> 01:45.049
Yes!

01:45.116 --> 01:46.983
Yeah, why don't you take that?

01:47.052 --> 01:50.320
I will go find the other
shoe for you in the back.

01:57.095 --> 01:58.395
Ah, there you go.

01:58.463 --> 01:59.363
Oh, sorry, sir.

01:59.431 --> 02:00.330
Those are mine, actually.

02:00.398 --> 02:01.331
No, it's not yours.

02:01.399 --> 02:02.699
They were on display.

02:02.767 --> 02:06.036
No, they were on the bench next to
my stuff, 'cause I picked 'em out.

02:06.104 --> 02:07.337
I know how a display looks.

02:07.405 --> 02:08.271
I'm not mentally disabled.

02:08.339 --> 02:09.273
I didn't say you were.

02:09.340 --> 02:11.375
It's just that I was
gonna buy those shoes.

02:11.443 --> 02:14.211
I don't think you really need a
sporty version of this shoe.

02:14.279 --> 02:15.112
And you do?

02:15.180 --> 02:16.513
Yeah, I'm a sporty person.

02:16.581 --> 02:17.948
Really?

02:18.015 --> 02:19.015
You seem more casual.

02:19.084 --> 02:21.051
You're a sporty person, and I'm casual?

02:21.119 --> 02:22.119
I'm very sporty.

02:22.187 --> 02:24.588
It's the color, it's the
style, it's the tread.

02:24.655 --> 02:26.056
How would you use the treads?

02:26.124 --> 02:29.359
I like tread, and I'm gonna
get a shoe with tread on it!

02:29.427 --> 02:30.427
Is everything okay over here?

02:30.495 --> 02:31.295
No, it's not okay.

02:31.362 --> 02:32.563
Everything's gonna be fine.

02:32.630 --> 02:33.964
Thank you for coming over.

02:34.031 --> 02:36.366
I was gonna purchase the Vapora Sport.

02:36.434 --> 02:38.635
Um, this gentleman is also
interested in the shoe.

02:38.703 --> 02:41.871
I'm not sure how much he
would be able to use it.

02:41.939 --> 02:45.242
He's telling me that because,
you know, I'm in wheelchair, I

02:45.310 --> 02:47.811
shouldn't get the shoe style that I want.

02:47.878 --> 02:50.547
Well, if one customer came
into the store first and chose

02:50.615 --> 02:55.285
the shoes first, might they have
dibs on it over another customer?

02:55.353 --> 02:57.053
Well, the customer's always right.

02:57.122 --> 02:58.222
Well, we're both customers.

02:58.289 --> 03:00.790
Then <i>this</i> customer is always right.

03:00.858 --> 03:02.058
On the lap.

03:02.127 --> 03:02.926
Here you are, sir.

03:02.994 --> 03:03.594
Right there!

03:03.661 --> 03:04.428
There you go.

03:04.496 --> 03:06.497
Ring me up!

03:08.533 --> 03:14.271
And you are now the proud owner of a
beautiful 1930s-era player piano.

03:14.339 --> 03:15.606
Your kid's gonna love this.

03:15.673 --> 03:16.440
It really is gorgeous.

03:16.508 --> 03:18.642
You just pump it with your
feet, it feeds air through the

03:18.709 --> 03:19.909
bellows, and you make music.

03:19.977 --> 03:20.511
Awesome.

03:20.578 --> 03:21.178
It's amazing.

03:21.246 --> 03:23.780
And when then you're done, you
flick that switch, and the paper

03:23.848 --> 03:24.948
rolls itself back.

03:25.016 --> 03:25.749
Okay.

03:25.816 --> 03:27.151
Whoa-whoa-whoa.

03:27.218 --> 03:27.984
The paper rolls itself?

03:28.052 --> 03:28.619
Yep.

03:28.686 --> 03:30.920
Can you put other kinds
of paper in there?

03:30.988 --> 03:31.855
No, no, you can't.

03:31.922 --> 03:33.023
He's right. I've tried it.

03:33.090 --> 03:33.790
See?

03:33.858 --> 03:37.093
So, yeah, if the spindle comes loose,
you just tighten it right there.

03:37.162 --> 03:37.694
Okay.

03:37.762 --> 03:39.296
And then... Oh, I am so sorry.

03:39.364 --> 03:40.964
I didn't know anyone was still here.

03:41.032 --> 03:42.466
Oh, yeah, we're just finishing up.

03:42.534 --> 03:43.767
We'll be done in a minute.

03:43.834 --> 03:45.035
Great.

03:45.102 --> 03:49.306
And, uh, yeah, and that's it.

03:49.374 --> 03:50.274
You're set.

03:50.341 --> 03:53.510
Uh, you got a restroom
I can use, by the way?

03:53.578 --> 03:55.679
Yeah. Side yard next to
the air conditioner.

03:55.746 --> 03:57.981
No, no. Down the hallway to the right.

03:58.049 --> 03:58.715
Hallway. Perfect.

03:58.783 --> 04:00.150
Yes.

04:00.218 --> 04:02.386
Why are you going to
the bathroom outside?

04:02.453 --> 04:03.720
Why are you peeing inside?

04:03.788 --> 04:05.722
It's great out there.

04:05.790 --> 04:06.356
Hey.

04:06.424 --> 04:06.990
Hey.

04:07.058 --> 04:09.359
You gave the piano guy
quite a show out there.

04:09.427 --> 04:11.395
Well, I didn't know he was still here.

04:11.462 --> 04:12.729
He's taking a really long time.

04:12.797 --> 04:15.499
I know. And I'm not even
really convinced this whole

04:15.567 --> 04:16.966
piano thing is a good idea.

04:17.034 --> 04:21.672
I just want to start her on an activity
that ensures she'll never have sex.

04:21.738 --> 04:22.339
Me, too.

04:22.407 --> 04:23.807
Okay. I still like my idea.

04:23.874 --> 04:25.642
I really think we should consider ballet.

04:25.710 --> 04:28.378
She can dance around with gay
guys, and she won't have sex

04:28.446 --> 04:29.379
till she's, like, 30.

04:29.447 --> 04:30.380
Are you kidding me?!

04:30.448 --> 04:32.349
Everyone wants to have
sex with ballerinas.

04:32.417 --> 04:33.650
Did you see <i>Black Swan?</i>

04:33.718 --> 04:35.719
<i>Ballerinas want to have
sex with ballerinas.</i>

04:35.786 --> 04:38.188
<i>Look, I think musical
instruments are the way to go.</i>

04:38.256 --> 04:40.490
<i>And we should just be
thankful it's not a woodwind.</i>

04:40.558 --> 04:41.692
<i>What do you mean?</i>

04:41.759 --> 04:45.362
<i>Really? Woodwind?</i>

04:45.430 --> 04:48.732
<i>Oh! God, Jenny!</i>

04:48.799 --> 04:51.335
<i>♪ Pete's little tiny
erect dick No one... ♪</i>

04:51.402 --> 04:54.404
<i>No. No, no, no, no, we're not
teaching Ellie that song.</i>

04:54.472 --> 04:55.272
<i>Why not?</i>

04:55.340 --> 04:56.940
<i>'Cause, obviously, it's
inappropriate, Taco.</i>

04:57.007 --> 04:59.576
<i>All right, so I think
we're all done here.</i>

05:02.012 --> 05:03.680
<i>What's wrong with your dog, man?</i>

05:03.748 --> 05:05.682
<i>Oh, you naughty boy.</i>

05:05.750 --> 05:06.950
<i>You need a cigarette?</i>

05:07.017 --> 05:08.585
<i>You want to take a little nap?</i>

05:08.653 --> 05:09.786
<i>I don't get it.</i>

05:09.854 --> 05:12.456
<i>Would Ditka know if someone jerked off?</i>

05:12.523 --> 05:13.857
<i>Oh, yeah. And he would bark.</i>

05:13.924 --> 05:15.959
<i>It'd be a pity bark, but he would bark.</i>

05:16.026 --> 05:17.060
<i>What are you saying?</i>

05:17.128 --> 05:19.296
<i>Did you just jerk off
in my bathroom, man?</i>

05:19.364 --> 05:20.096
<i>No!</i>

05:20.164 --> 05:22.432
<i>My wife walked by, you
obviously took a good look at</i>

05:22.500 --> 05:24.534
<i>her, and then you went
right to the bathroom.</i>

05:24.602 --> 05:25.235
<i>It's disgusting!</i>

05:25.303 --> 05:28.037
<i>First of all, what is this,
the Playboy mansion?</i>

05:28.105 --> 05:28.972
<i>Who does this?!</i>

05:29.039 --> 05:30.440
<i>Oh, wow. Really?</i>

05:30.508 --> 05:31.575
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

05:31.643 --> 05:32.743
<i>You guys are insane.</i>

05:32.810 --> 05:36.246
<i>I don't know who teaches a dog
to bark at someone's dick.</i>

05:36.314 --> 05:37.147
<i>This guy does.</i>

05:37.214 --> 05:38.382
<i>Yeah, that guy does.</i>

05:38.449 --> 05:39.082
<i>You're nuts.</i>

05:39.150 --> 05:40.150
<i>I'm really insulted.</i>

05:40.217 --> 05:40.784
<i>Good.</i>

05:40.851 --> 05:41.718
<i>And I'm leaving.</i>

05:41.786 --> 05:42.819
<i>Good. You're an animal.</i>

05:42.887 --> 05:45.389
<i>Next time jerk off in your
van like a gentleman.</i>

05:45.456 --> 05:46.323
<i>What was that?</i>

05:47.057 --> 05:49.826
<i>Michael Moore came in here
and J'd off in our bathroom.</i>

05:49.894 --> 05:50.494
<i>What?!</i>

05:50.561 --> 05:52.262
<i>Cracked his meat all over the place.</i>

05:52.330 --> 05:52.962
<i>It's disgusting.</i>

05:53.030 --> 05:55.165
<i>He just jerked off in our bathroom?</i>

05:55.232 --> 05:58.101
<i>Yes, yeah. He saw you, and
then asked to be excused to go</i>

05:58.169 --> 06:00.103
<i>to the bathroom and... What?!</i>

06:00.171 --> 06:00.771
<i>Yeah.</i>

06:00.838 --> 06:01.938
<i>That is disgusting!</i>

06:02.006 --> 06:05.275
<i>He went and jerked off in our
bathroom after he saw me walk by?</i>

06:05.343 --> 06:08.912
<i>Yes. I mean, what kind of
self-control does this guy have?</i>

06:08.979 --> 06:09.780
<i>I don't know.</i>

06:09.847 --> 06:11.080
<i>I think it's really disgusting.</i>

06:11.148 --> 06:12.616
<i>It's disgusting.</i>

06:12.684 --> 06:13.417
<i>Yeah, it is.</i>

06:13.484 --> 06:14.818
<i>Really jerked off to me?</i>

06:14.885 --> 06:17.621
<i>I think you're losing focus
of the issue at hand here.</i>

06:17.689 --> 06:18.955
<i>I'm not, I'm not. It's gross.</i>

06:19.023 --> 06:19.589
<i>Yeah.</i>

06:19.657 --> 06:22.158
<i>But I gotta say it was kind of my fault.</i>

06:22.226 --> 06:23.159
<i>My robe was really short.</i>

06:23.227 --> 06:24.027
<i>He couldn't help himself.</i>

06:24.862 --> 06:29.700
<i>Look at me. I mean... Jenny, okay, relax.</i>

06:29.767 --> 06:33.603
<i>Is that player piano playing
"Pick a Bale of Cotton"?</i>

06:33.671 --> 06:34.538
<i>Yep.</i>

06:34.605 --> 06:37.841
<i>Oh, great! First this guy
comes in and treats our house</i>

06:37.908 --> 06:40.619
<i>like an adult theater, then
he drops off a racist piano.</i>

06:40.739 --> 06:42.506
<i>Obviously, the piano company
just unloaded a product</i>

06:42.574 --> 06:44.804
<i>they didn't want anymore.</i>

06:44.924 --> 06:46.625
<i>He unloaded a lot of stuff no one wants.</i>

06:46.692 --> 06:47.226
<i>Yeah.</i>

06:47.293 --> 06:48.033
<i>Thank you.</i>

06:55.623 --> 06:56.423
Knock, knock.

06:56.491 --> 06:57.966
Got two tickets to saladise.

06:58.192 --> 06:58.758
What?

06:58.826 --> 06:59.493
We'll get lunch.

06:59.560 --> 07:01.261
Remember? You said we're
gonna eat lunch together.

07:01.329 --> 07:02.095
I didn't say that.

07:02.163 --> 07:02.962
Um, I e-mailed you.

07:03.030 --> 07:03.997
You never e-mailed me back.

07:04.064 --> 07:05.432
So you took that as a yes?

07:05.500 --> 07:06.233
You got it.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.234
Knock, knock, knock.

07:07.301 --> 07:08.268
Hey.

07:08.336 --> 07:09.269
Hey, Michelle.

07:09.337 --> 07:10.670
How are you?

07:10.738 --> 07:11.838
I'm good. This is Andre.

07:11.905 --> 07:12.506
Client?

07:12.573 --> 07:13.607
Friend.

07:13.674 --> 07:20.013
Anyway, guess who got two luxury box
seats to the Bears game on Sunday?

07:20.080 --> 07:21.080
Wow. How did you do that?

07:21.149 --> 07:24.083
Oh, you know the sponsorship deal
we're working on for Soldier Field?

07:24.152 --> 07:26.085
Hudabega put you on that case?

07:26.154 --> 07:27.086
Yeah, he did.

07:27.155 --> 07:27.920
Wow.

07:27.988 --> 07:28.921
Yeah, it's gonna be great.

07:28.989 --> 07:31.525
I'm gonna meet all the players,
I'm gonna be working with the

07:31.592 --> 07:34.694
front office, bringing any
friend I'd like to the games.

07:34.762 --> 07:37.030
What are you... what are you working on?

07:37.097 --> 07:39.466
I'm, uh, working on that Rosenthal case.

07:39.534 --> 07:41.968
Oh, the blind guy who kind
of smells like fungus?

07:42.036 --> 07:43.370
Mm-hmm, yeah.

07:43.437 --> 07:44.471
Yup, yup, yup.

07:44.539 --> 07:45.472
Anyways, go Bears.

07:45.540 --> 07:46.473
Is that what you say?

07:46.541 --> 07:48.375
I don't even know--
don't watch the sport.

07:48.442 --> 07:49.376
Don't even like it.

07:49.443 --> 07:50.377
Bye, Michelle.

07:50.444 --> 07:51.311
Bye.

07:51.379 --> 07:53.012
Whoa, talk about chemistry.

07:53.080 --> 07:55.014
How is she on Hudabega's good side?

07:55.082 --> 07:56.115
She must be sleeping with him.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.450
You just jump to sex?

07:57.518 --> 07:58.518
Maybe she's qualified.

07:58.586 --> 08:01.288
Qualified is not a problem,
I can undermine qualified.

08:01.355 --> 08:03.490
But I can't undermine sex.

08:03.558 --> 08:05.725
Well, I mean, you could
always sleep with Hudabega.

08:05.793 --> 08:08.728
I don't think he'd be interested in me--
I got to lose like ten or 15 pounds.

08:08.796 --> 08:11.964
And that's why we need to get salads.
Let's do it!

08:18.306 --> 08:19.839
Hi there. Car trouble?

08:19.907 --> 08:20.674
Hey, yes!

08:20.741 --> 08:22.676
I have no idea what to do, it
just stopped, and it's smoking

08:22.743 --> 08:24.511
everywhere, and I don't have Triple A.

08:24.579 --> 08:26.513
Listen, you have nothing to worry about.

08:26.581 --> 08:28.548
There's a garage that's
like a block away.

08:28.616 --> 08:30.383
I'm gonna push this car for you, okay?

08:30.451 --> 08:32.018
We're gonna put it in that garage.

08:32.086 --> 08:34.020
There's actually a nice
coffee shop right next door.

08:34.087 --> 08:34.654
Okay.

08:34.722 --> 08:35.655
Maybe I can buy you a coffee?

08:35.722 --> 08:36.655
I'd like that. Thank you.

08:36.724 --> 08:39.659
All right, let's get this done.

08:41.929 --> 08:42.861
It's slippery.

08:42.929 --> 08:45.365
Having trouble getting traction.

08:45.433 --> 08:46.366
Should I help?

08:46.434 --> 08:47.367
I just want to get a grip.

08:47.435 --> 08:49.369
The shoes are a little slippery.

08:52.273 --> 08:53.240
Oh, my God, are you okay?

08:53.307 --> 08:56.409
Yeah, oh... Oh, my goodness.

08:56.477 --> 08:57.410
I'm good, I'm good.

08:57.478 --> 08:59.246
No, no, no you're not... I got it.

08:59.313 --> 09:00.247
We got it, we got it.

09:00.314 --> 09:01.781
No, no, no, stop, it's okay.

09:01.849 --> 09:04.351
It's-it's a heavy car.

09:04.418 --> 09:05.418
It's not heavy.

09:05.486 --> 09:07.420
Well, it's heavy for you.

09:10.524 --> 09:12.525
Ooh, yeah, that is bad.

09:12.593 --> 09:13.727
That is deep.

09:13.794 --> 09:15.795
Yeah, you're gonna need
stitches for sure, for sure.

09:15.863 --> 09:18.865
All right, let me clarify what
happened with you and this woman.

09:18.932 --> 09:20.933
You were helping her with her
car-- what I don't understand is

09:21.001 --> 09:23.536
when Kevin's balls appeared and
just thwacked you under the

09:23.604 --> 09:25.138
chin and lacerated it.

09:25.205 --> 09:26.205
You know what, very funny.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.908
The problem is the goddamn
treads on the shoes, okay?

09:28.976 --> 09:33.446
If that asshole in the wheelchair had not
stolen the good tread shoes out from

09:33.514 --> 09:37.284
underneath me, none of this
would've happened, and by the

09:37.351 --> 09:38.318
way, what does he need them for?

09:38.386 --> 09:39.419
He doesn't need the treads.

09:39.487 --> 09:40.453
He just wants to look cool?

09:40.521 --> 09:42.889
I-I just don't understand why
we're placing the blame on the

09:42.956 --> 09:44.391
wheelchair guy or the shoes.

09:44.458 --> 09:45.825
You really need to look inward.

09:45.893 --> 09:48.395
Why do you need high-end
shoes to begin with?

09:48.462 --> 09:49.496
What are you saying, Kevin?

09:49.563 --> 09:52.899
I mean, on a scale of Olympic
athlete to wheelchair guy, you

09:52.966 --> 09:55.902
swing closer to wheelchair guy.

09:55.969 --> 09:56.903
You have to know that.

09:56.970 --> 09:59.906
I'm sorry, this is coming from
the man who has the diet of

09:59.973 --> 10:01.741
a morbidly obese pre-teen?

10:01.809 --> 10:04.511
This is coming from a
guy who's eaten, what?

10:04.578 --> 10:05.945
Four slices of pizza today?

10:06.013 --> 10:09.416
Well, when you're training like
I am, pizza is caloric fuel.

10:09.483 --> 10:10.617
Michael Phelps takes in 12,000

10:10.685 --> 10:13.119
calories a day for that
kind of performance.

10:13.187 --> 10:15.422
Pete, please tell me you're
not comparing yourself to

10:15.489 --> 10:18.124
the most decorated athlete
in Olympic history.

10:18.192 --> 10:19.459
Look, we're different sports.

10:19.527 --> 10:20.460
You can't compare the two.

10:20.528 --> 10:21.528
What sport do you play?

10:21.595 --> 10:22.529
I'm an athlete.

10:22.596 --> 10:24.331
Your sport is "athlete"?

10:24.398 --> 10:25.365
You're goddamn right.

10:25.433 --> 10:28.368
And this athlete is going to have another
piece of caloric fuel right now.

10:28.436 --> 10:29.202
Not that one.

10:29.269 --> 10:30.203
That's... don't touch it.

10:30.270 --> 10:31.103
That's mine.

10:31.171 --> 10:32.439
You gonna stop me?

10:32.506 --> 10:33.673
Yeah.

10:33.741 --> 10:36.443
Get over here... Come on, Fat-iator.

10:36.510 --> 10:38.378
Are you not entertained?

10:38.446 --> 10:40.814
Come on, come on.

10:40.881 --> 10:41.881
Whoa!

10:41.949 --> 10:42.882
Ow!

10:42.950 --> 10:45.885
You just lost to someone
wearing Vapora Casuals, son.

10:45.953 --> 10:48.955
Wow, what a show of athletic prowess.

10:49.022 --> 10:51.958
It's like watching a beauty contest
between Sam Cassell and Jeff Van Gundy.

10:52.025 --> 10:52.959
Oh, really?

10:53.026 --> 10:55.995
This coming from the guy who lost to
the blind wrestler in high school?

10:56.063 --> 10:58.465
Look, what the blind lack in
sight, they make up for in

10:58.532 --> 10:59.833
craftiness and strength.

10:59.900 --> 11:02.068
They're a very strong people,
and I have to deal with one

11:02.135 --> 11:03.069
right now at work and it sucks.

11:03.672 --> 11:05.607
You got to find out if that
lawyer lady is banging Hudabega

11:05.674 --> 11:07.609
or you're gonna keep on
getting these crap cases.

11:07.676 --> 11:08.443
I know.

11:08.511 --> 11:09.577
You should just use Ditka.

11:09.645 --> 11:10.612
Huh?

11:10.679 --> 11:12.948
Taco trained our mom's
dog to sniff out sex.

11:13.016 --> 11:14.049
Yeah, he's like a bone hound.

11:15.771 --> 11:17.332
Aw... you know...

11:17.592 --> 11:19.669
♪ Jump down,
turn around Pick a bail of cotton

11:19.789 --> 11:24.426
Jump down, turn around ♪ Pick a bail a
day Oh, Lord, pick a bail of cotton... ♪

11:24.493 --> 11:25.460
Oh, oh, no, no, no, okay.

11:25.528 --> 11:26.461
Honey, no, no, no.

11:26.529 --> 11:28.420
Where did you get those lyrics?

11:28.540 --> 11:30.032
I found them in the piano bench.

11:30.099 --> 11:31.033
I love this song.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.600
This is my favorite song ever.

11:32.668 --> 11:33.601
Oh, no, no, no.

11:33.669 --> 11:36.038
Let's get rid of these, and-and
take off Mommy's robe.

11:36.105 --> 11:37.572
You shouldn't have that on.

11:37.640 --> 11:39.041
But it's cozy.

11:39.108 --> 11:40.608
You know what, sweetheart?

11:40.676 --> 11:44.046
How about we stop playing a musical
instrument and start watching television?

11:44.113 --> 11:44.879
Yeah!

11:44.948 --> 11:46.915
Yeah, I hear <i>The Grand Wizards
of Waverly Place</i> is on.

11:46.983 --> 11:48.951
You know what, let's just get
rid of this thing before we

11:49.018 --> 11:51.386
traumatize our daughter any
more than we already have.

11:51.454 --> 11:53.956
You know, if we just put her
in ballet, all I would have to

11:54.023 --> 11:56.158
return is a pair of Capezios
and an eating disorder.

11:56.225 --> 11:58.160
Can I propose a
best-of-both-worlds scenario?

11:58.227 --> 11:58.793
Please.

11:58.861 --> 12:00.795
Maybe you should get some
chocolate pudding, wipe it all

12:00.863 --> 12:03.385
over her face, and then she
can perform <i>Blackface Swan.</i>

12:11.810 --> 12:15.260
All right, so in a couple of weeks, no
one will even know that it happened.

12:15.380 --> 12:16.280
This is awesome, Andre.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.448
Seriously, thank you for doing
this, especially for free.

12:18.516 --> 12:20.950
Uh... of course, yes, yes.

12:21.018 --> 12:22.186
I mean, I'll buy you a beer.

12:22.253 --> 12:23.953
Hey, hey.

12:24.021 --> 12:24.988
I'll buy you a beer.

12:25.056 --> 12:26.056
I'm gonna get you some Scar Gel.

12:26.123 --> 12:27.157
I'll be right back.

12:27.225 --> 12:30.126
All right.

12:30.195 --> 12:32.862
I like your outfit as well.

12:32.930 --> 12:33.863
I bet you do.

12:33.931 --> 12:35.465
You got a cute little giggle.

12:35.533 --> 12:36.466
No.

12:36.534 --> 12:38.989
I'm just gonna take you to exam room six.

12:39.236 --> 12:40.541
Need a ride?

12:40.661 --> 12:42.271
Oh, that's okay, I can walk.

12:42.391 --> 12:44.226
Unbelievable.

12:44.293 --> 12:46.228
You might be the one to
get me back in the game.

12:46.295 --> 12:47.395
Oh.

12:47.463 --> 12:48.663
Oh, come on.

12:48.731 --> 12:49.664
Do you coach?

12:49.732 --> 12:51.833
No, not really, no I don't coach.

12:51.900 --> 12:52.834
We're gonna go in here.

12:52.901 --> 12:54.836
I'm on the bench right now, right?

12:54.903 --> 12:57.038
Some things ain't working right now.

12:57.106 --> 12:58.440
You just cute as a button.

12:58.507 --> 12:59.441
Look at you.

12:59.508 --> 13:01.209
Thank you. Right on in here.

13:01.277 --> 13:02.277
So curvy.

13:02.345 --> 13:03.545
Hello, DeRon.

13:03.613 --> 13:06.180
So, what's his deal-- he can smell sex?

13:06.249 --> 13:09.917
Yeah. Even if she towels down her gens
post-intercourse, he'll smell it.

13:09.985 --> 13:11.753
Wow, so even if she T's those G's?

13:11.820 --> 13:12.787
Yeah.

13:12.855 --> 13:13.688
Hey, hey, hey.

13:13.756 --> 13:14.856
Hi, little cutie.

13:14.923 --> 13:16.858
Hi. Who's this?

13:16.925 --> 13:18.092
This is Taco.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.127
This is Michelle.

13:19.194 --> 13:20.228
Friend? Client?

13:20.296 --> 13:21.062
Both.

13:21.130 --> 13:21.896
Neither.

13:21.964 --> 13:22.731
Mm.

13:22.798 --> 13:23.565
How are you?

13:23.633 --> 13:25.634
Good. Hear there's a new case
for a private jet company.

13:25.701 --> 13:29.471
They're comping a year membership
for anyone who gets it, so... yeah.

13:29.538 --> 13:30.572
Wow.

13:30.640 --> 13:34.108
Just going to throw my old hat into
the ring and see what happens.

13:34.176 --> 13:35.910
Is that what you're
calling it these days?

13:35.978 --> 13:36.745
Yeah.

13:36.812 --> 13:37.579
Well, wish me luck.

13:37.647 --> 13:38.413
Boob, boop.

13:38.481 --> 13:39.247
Good luck.

13:39.315 --> 13:40.749
Knock, knock, knock.

13:40.816 --> 13:44.218
Hello, sir.

13:44.287 --> 13:45.754
Here's the deal.

13:45.821 --> 13:50.492
We wait out here, if the dog barks
when she comes out, she's busted.

13:50.559 --> 13:51.893
Can you hear anything?

13:51.960 --> 13:54.629
No, it's like listening to
Kevin and Jenny have sex.

13:54.697 --> 13:56.964
There's two minutes of
silence, then tears.

13:57.032 --> 13:57.899
Jenny?

13:57.966 --> 13:58.833
Kevin.

13:58.901 --> 13:59.768
Oh.

13:59.835 --> 14:03.471
All right, well, will... Where... where
did Ditka... where did Ditka go?

14:03.539 --> 14:05.340
I don't know, he's pretty independent.

14:05.408 --> 14:06.508
You don't put him on a leash?

14:06.575 --> 14:07.342
No.

14:07.410 --> 14:09.844
I'm not the controlling
type of dog owner.

14:09.912 --> 14:11.078
Ditka!

14:11.146 --> 14:12.414
Ditka!

14:12.481 --> 14:15.417
So on the Jackson scale, you kind of
want between Tito and Janet, got it.

14:15.484 --> 14:16.484
I don't want Janet's nose.

14:16.552 --> 14:17.319
No, no.

14:17.386 --> 14:19.120
It's a little too thin for me.

14:19.188 --> 14:20.955
I don't want Tito's nose... Too big.

14:21.023 --> 14:22.824
...it's a little too wide for me.

14:22.891 --> 14:23.658
Got it. Look at Jermaine.

14:23.726 --> 14:25.327
Jermaine has a nice damn nose.

14:25.394 --> 14:27.195
Um, the main thing, though, I
feel is though, because I'm in

14:27.262 --> 14:29.831
a wheelchair, you know, it's
presentation in a wheelchair.

14:29.898 --> 14:30.632
Right. Yeah.

14:30.700 --> 14:32.200
Like, you meet a woman... Right.

14:32.267 --> 14:34.636
...she got big tits, you look
right at her cleavage, right?

14:34.704 --> 14:35.337
Boom.

14:35.404 --> 14:37.038
First thing you see is
the breasts, right?

14:37.105 --> 14:37.872
Right. Yeah.

14:37.940 --> 14:39.774
And I call 'em breasts because
they're breasts, right?

14:39.842 --> 14:40.608
Right.

14:40.676 --> 14:43.177
But once a woman gets 'em done,
those breasts are now titties.

14:43.245 --> 14:44.011
You understand?

14:44.079 --> 14:44.846
Right, right, right.

14:44.913 --> 14:46.681
When they meet a person in a
wheelchair, the first thing they

14:46.749 --> 14:47.549
do is look down at their legs.

14:47.616 --> 14:50.618
So you want to get some
implants for your calves.

14:50.686 --> 14:52.153
I need titties.

14:52.221 --> 14:53.321
These are breasts right now.

14:53.389 --> 14:54.522
I need titties.

14:54.590 --> 14:57.525
So you have some leg breasts that you
want to make into some leg titties.

14:57.593 --> 14:58.360
You're damn right.

14:58.427 --> 14:59.293
I need leg titties. Right.

14:59.362 --> 15:00.995
Let's get you some leg titties.

15:01.063 --> 15:02.797
I'm gonna come back with some samples.

15:02.865 --> 15:04.532
I gotta get back in the game, man!

15:04.600 --> 15:05.567
You'll get back in that game.

15:05.634 --> 15:07.702
Oh... Hi.

15:07.770 --> 15:09.671
This is, uh, DeRon calling.

15:09.739 --> 15:12.474
Yeah, last time I came there,
um, I wanted to get my nails

15:12.541 --> 15:14.876
done, but there was no one
there to help me get in.

15:14.943 --> 15:16.578
Didn't have the ramp put in yet.

15:16.645 --> 15:19.146
Last time I came, you had like
four girls to help me get in.

15:19.214 --> 15:21.048
'Bout time, I'm happy to hear that.

15:21.116 --> 15:23.385
I need to get over there,
'cause my nails are shot.

15:23.452 --> 15:24.386
Yeah.

15:25.454 --> 15:26.821
I know.

15:26.889 --> 15:30.358
Yeah, I... I was rollin', had my
foot came out of the footrest.

15:30.426 --> 15:31.526
Yeah.

15:31.594 --> 15:36.498
And, um, evidently my feet had
been dragging for like... a few

15:36.565 --> 15:38.433
blocks, dragging... dragging
underneath the chair.

15:38.501 --> 15:39.267
Ditka.

15:39.334 --> 15:40.101
Ditka.

15:40.168 --> 15:40.935
Ditka.

15:41.003 --> 15:41.770
Ditka.

15:41.837 --> 15:42.604
Oh, oh!

15:42.671 --> 15:43.438
There he is.

15:43.506 --> 15:44.272
Oh, my God!

15:44.339 --> 15:45.106
Yeah.

15:45.173 --> 15:47.409
Ditka's having sex with
Mr. Rosenthal's Seeing Eye dog.

15:47.476 --> 15:48.242
Yeah.

15:48.310 --> 15:50.011
I hear Seeing Eye dogs are good lays.

15:50.078 --> 15:51.012
Very obedient.

15:51.079 --> 15:53.080
If I get caught for this, I'm
gonna get fired or even worse,

15:53.148 --> 15:54.783
have to do pro bono work.

15:54.850 --> 15:57.351
Looks like Ditka's doing some
pro bono work himself, huh?

15:57.420 --> 15:58.352
Ah!

15:59.422 --> 16:02.757
Tilly, will you hold on
for just another minute?

16:02.825 --> 16:04.759
What has gotten into you, girl?

16:12.968 --> 16:14.469
Okay, okay, Tilly.

16:14.537 --> 16:18.807
We'll go for that walk.

16:18.874 --> 16:19.641
All right, girl.

16:19.708 --> 16:20.608
Here we go.

16:20.676 --> 16:23.545
Remember what we learned in school...
steady gait.

16:23.612 --> 16:24.579
All right.

16:24.647 --> 16:26.314
How you doing, girl?

16:29.284 --> 16:31.385
Ruxin?

16:31.454 --> 16:34.288
Hey, w... uh, what's
going on, Mr. Rosenthal?

16:35.190 --> 16:35.957
Someone else is here.

16:36.024 --> 16:37.792
Someone using marijuana.

16:37.860 --> 16:38.927
Wow, he's good.

16:38.994 --> 16:39.894
I took edibles.

16:39.962 --> 16:40.728
Where's my dog?

16:40.796 --> 16:42.129
Um, she's here.

16:42.197 --> 16:43.765
She's here, hanging out.

16:44.834 --> 16:46.133
Is she having sex?

16:46.201 --> 16:46.968
She's making love.

16:47.035 --> 16:48.169
I would say she's making love.

16:48.236 --> 16:50.004
Is my dog having anal sex?

16:50.072 --> 16:51.973
Well, he stayed with me for a full week.

16:52.040 --> 16:53.741
He's bound to pick up a few things.

16:53.809 --> 16:56.811
Ooh, how dare you bring your dog
in here to sodomize my dog?

16:56.879 --> 16:59.413
Look, we'll get out of here and
figure this all out, okay?

16:59.482 --> 17:01.148
Oh, no.

17:02.852 --> 17:04.185
Lookit, lookit.

17:04.252 --> 17:05.974
Look, look, look... Ah!

17:06.974 --> 17:07.746
Let me go!

17:07.866 --> 17:10.185
No one treats my Tilly like that!

17:10.306 --> 17:12.244
I didn't mean to.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.862
Why are the blind so strong?

17:13.929 --> 17:16.297
Why are the blind so strong?

17:18.000 --> 17:24.074

17:25.851 --> 17:26.751
All right, so where were we?

17:26.819 --> 17:29.754
We were talking about different,
uh, calf sizes and implants.

17:29.822 --> 17:31.489
These are not my damn shoes.

17:31.557 --> 17:32.791
What do you mean?

17:32.858 --> 17:34.767
These are Vapora Casuals!

17:34.887 --> 17:36.287
I had Vapora Sports on!

17:36.355 --> 17:37.322
These have no tread!

17:37.389 --> 17:39.925
My Vapora Sports have
tread all over the place!

17:39.993 --> 17:40.792
Loaded with tread!

17:40.860 --> 17:42.460
Well, why would you need tread?

17:42.528 --> 17:43.495
I didn't... that came out wrong.

17:43.562 --> 17:44.329
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:44.396 --> 17:45.998
Put that back in your mouth right now.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.766
Catch it and put it back in your mouth.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.501
Okay, look, first of all, I
need to tell you that I am and

17:49.568 --> 17:52.070
will always be a friend of the
African-American paralyzed community.

17:52.138 --> 17:54.773
What do you think, there's a community
of paralyzed ghetto people?

17:54.841 --> 17:55.607
What, there's not?

17:55.675 --> 17:56.441
No, there's not.

17:56.509 --> 17:59.845
Okay, well, I will tell you... How dare
you even ask me that stupid question?

17:59.912 --> 18:03.281
I just want you to know that if you...
You find my damn sneakers now.

18:03.349 --> 18:05.851
Okay, I'll... Where's
that sexy-ass nurse?

18:05.918 --> 18:06.752
Sexy-ass nurse!

18:06.819 --> 18:07.619
You got my damn sneakers?!

18:07.687 --> 18:08.520
Just... keep it down.

18:08.587 --> 18:09.354
Bernice?

18:09.421 --> 18:11.123
Yeah, babe, I've got the piano.

18:11.190 --> 18:13.925
I'm just trying to find a place to park.

18:13.993 --> 18:15.861
Oh, shoot.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.428
I think this is a one-way.

18:17.496 --> 18:18.429
Damn it.

18:18.497 --> 18:20.098
All right, I gotta back up.

18:20.166 --> 18:20.932
Hey, butterscotch.

18:21.000 --> 18:21.967
How about some chocolate?

18:23.770 --> 18:28.006
Yeah... Hey, man, what's... Oh, shit!

18:28.074 --> 18:29.041
I think I just hit something.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.008
All right, I gotta go.

18:31.177 --> 18:32.343
Oh, my God!

18:32.411 --> 18:33.178
Ah!

18:33.245 --> 18:34.012
Oh, no, no, no, no.

18:34.080 --> 18:34.846
Are you okay?

18:34.914 --> 18:35.681
No, I'm not okay!

18:35.748 --> 18:36.514
Oh, I'm so sorry.

18:36.582 --> 18:39.184
I didn't see you, I was backing up...
Look at my velour outfit!

18:39.251 --> 18:40.118
You ruined it, it's scuffed.

18:40.186 --> 18:41.987
We can sew it up, I'll sew up the velour.

18:42.055 --> 18:42.821
It's not a big deal.

18:42.889 --> 18:43.655
It's the velour.

18:43.723 --> 18:44.489
It's a scuff.

18:44.557 --> 18:45.356
It's not a rip or a tear.

18:45.424 --> 18:46.191
We'll polish it.

18:46.258 --> 18:47.959
You can't polish no damn velour!

18:48.027 --> 18:48.794
Don't you know velour?

18:48.861 --> 18:49.728
I don't know from velour!

18:49.796 --> 18:51.529
Now look, I'm already late
for my appointment, man.

18:51.597 --> 18:53.298
I got a very important pedicure
appointment with Mrs. Kim...

18:53.365 --> 18:54.132
A pedicure appointment?

18:54.200 --> 18:56.168
Don't-don't-don't-don't...
please don't do that.

18:56.235 --> 18:58.070
I'm just saying, I don't...
I don't see the point.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.037
Don't do that to me, man.

18:59.105 --> 19:01.707
If I want to take care of my feet,
I'll take care of my feet, okay?

19:01.774 --> 19:03.474
Have you always taken care of your feet?

19:03.542 --> 19:05.210
Why would I not take care of my feet?

19:05.277 --> 19:07.045
Because God didn't take
care of your feet.

19:07.113 --> 19:07.879
My feet are fine, okay?

19:07.947 --> 19:08.714
I look great in sandals.

19:08.781 --> 19:11.249
Please, let-let me help you get
to your pedicure appointment.

19:11.317 --> 19:12.084
How dare you, man?

19:12.151 --> 19:15.187
Just because I can't use 'em doesn't
mean I don't want 'em to look nice.

19:15.254 --> 19:16.021
What can I do?

19:16.089 --> 19:16.888
I-I'll help you get there.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.656
Unless you got a wheelchair
in the back of this goofy-ass

19:18.725 --> 19:19.858
truck, don't say shit to me!

19:19.926 --> 19:21.026
I got a appointment to get to!

19:21.094 --> 19:22.894
You know what, I don't have a
wheelchair, but I think I have

19:22.962 --> 19:23.829
something else that might work.

19:23.896 --> 19:24.662
You did this to yourself.

19:24.731 --> 19:25.496
I know.

19:25.564 --> 19:27.866
You did it to me first, and now
you're doing it to yourself.

19:27.934 --> 19:28.700
Okay, sorry.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.069
Simultaneously.

19:37.576 --> 19:40.245
Yes, I dropped the piano
off one block away.

19:40.312 --> 19:44.850
I... No, I don't think it's
unreasonable you pick it up one block.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.788
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

19:49.856 --> 19:51.857
Shoe thief!

19:51.924 --> 19:53.291
Shoe thief.

19:53.359 --> 19:54.292
Pete?

19:54.360 --> 19:55.761
Kevin?

19:55.828 --> 19:57.428
What are you doing with wheelchair guy?

19:57.496 --> 19:58.764
I want my shoes back.

19:58.831 --> 19:59.931
Uh-uh.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.900
These are my shoes.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.201
I'm all warmed up now.

20:03.269 --> 20:05.737
You want to see who the
better athlete is?

20:05.805 --> 20:09.374
Rematch?

20:09.441 --> 20:12.978
It's on.

20:17.383 --> 20:18.716
Shithead!

20:20.519 --> 20:22.087
Hey, babe, what's your name?

20:22.155 --> 20:23.321
Stop him!

20:23.389 --> 20:24.289
Stop him!

20:25.858 --> 20:27.092
Ah, oh, ow!

20:27.160 --> 20:28.293
Ow, Achilles!

20:28.360 --> 20:29.227
Achilles!

20:29.295 --> 20:30.428
Ah, ah, ah!

20:30.496 --> 20:34.065
Oh, shit... My hammie... ow...

20:34.133 --> 20:34.900
Oh, shit.

20:34.967 --> 20:35.967
Who's got me? Who's got me?

20:36.035 --> 20:36.968
Shit.

20:37.036 --> 20:38.236
Who's got me? Who's got me?

20:39.305 --> 20:40.071
Is that your piano?

20:40.139 --> 20:40.906
Ah, piano!

20:40.973 --> 20:41.739
Oh, shit!

20:41.808 --> 20:42.573
Oh, shit!

20:42.641 --> 20:43.408
Not the face!

20:44.543 --> 20:47.612
Ow... Oh, my God.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.981
Oh, my velour is beyond scuffed.

20:50.049 --> 20:51.082
Hey, you can't return this.

20:51.150 --> 20:52.483
What?

20:52.551 --> 20:54.419
Say hello to your wife for me.

20:54.486 --> 20:56.354
You son of a bitch.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.957
Is this piano playing
"Pick A Bale of Cotton"?

20:59.025 --> 21:01.507
For the record, I wanted my
daughter to take ballet.

21:01.627 --> 21:03.166
Ugh, my leg tickles.
