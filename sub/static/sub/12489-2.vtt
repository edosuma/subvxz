WEBVTT

00:07.478 --> 00:09.340
DID YOU ENJOY YOUR WALK,
BUDDY?

00:09.340 --> 00:11.512
LOVE THE WALK,
HATE THE LEASH.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.644
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE GETTING
YANKED BY THE NECK

00:13.644 --> 00:16.287
EVERY TIME YOU TRIED
TO LICK A BABY?

00:16.287 --> 00:19.390
THE NEIGHBORS GET UPSET
IF DOGS AREN'T ON A LEASH.

00:19.390 --> 00:21.652
OH, SO NOW I'M A DOG?

00:21.652 --> 00:24.325
JUST BECAUSE I HAVE FOUR LEGS,
FUR, A TAIL, AND...

00:24.325 --> 00:25.756
YEAH, OKAY,
I SEE YOUR POINT.

00:25.756 --> 00:27.528
BUT COME ON!

00:27.528 --> 00:29.760
THESE BLUE POOP BAGS
TIED TO MY COLLAR?

00:29.760 --> 00:31.162
TALK ABOUT DEMEANING!

00:31.162 --> 00:35.506
I'M SORRY, BUT IF YOU GO,
I HAVE TO CLEAN UP AFTER YOU,

00:35.506 --> 00:37.738
AND IT'S JUST
HANDIER THIS WAY.

00:37.738 --> 00:38.769
OH, REALLY?

00:38.769 --> 00:40.471
AND WHEN AM I GONNA
SEE YOU WALKING AROUND

00:40.471 --> 00:43.614
WITH A ROLL OF TOILET
PAPER AROUND YOUR NECK?

00:43.614 --> 00:46.647
WHEN I START POOPING
ON THE SIDEWALK.

00:46.647 --> 00:50.121
NOW, NOW, NOW.
FAIR IS FAIR.

00:50.121 --> 00:52.283
REALLY? THIS MAKES
YOU FEEL BETTER?

00:53.824 --> 00:57.758
I'M NOT PROUD OF IT,
BUT YES. YES, IT DOES.

00:57.758 --> 01:00.391
ALTHOUGH I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT REALLY MAKES ME
FEEL BETTER.

01:02.233 --> 01:05.136
( laughing )

01:25.656 --> 01:27.588
WE'RE HOME!

01:27.588 --> 01:29.860
WAIT TILL THEY HEAR
YOU GOT YOUR LEARNER'S
PERMIT, HUH?

01:29.860 --> 01:32.493
YEAH! I CAN FINALLY DRIVE!
WHOO-HOO!

01:32.493 --> 01:34.365
Stan: THIS SHAVED MONKEY
CAN DRIVE A CAR,

01:34.365 --> 01:35.826
AND I CAN'T EVEN CHASE ONE?

01:35.826 --> 01:38.269
YEAH, THAT'S FAIR.

01:38.269 --> 01:39.730
TYLER, SWEETIE,
I FEEL BAD.

01:39.730 --> 01:41.602
A LOT OF PEOPLE
DON'T PASS THEIR TEST

01:41.602 --> 01:42.703
THE FIRST TIME.
I PASSED.

01:42.703 --> 01:45.676
YOU'LL GET 'EM
NEXT TIME-- WHAT?

01:45.676 --> 01:46.877
YOU DID? REALLY?

01:46.877 --> 01:49.410
WOW! REALLY?

01:49.410 --> 01:50.781
HEY, TYLER, TOO BAD,

01:50.781 --> 01:52.543
BUT, I MEAN,
MAYBE IF YOU'D STUDIED--

01:52.543 --> 01:53.544
I PASSED.

01:53.544 --> 01:56.217
YOU'RE GONNA BE DRIVING?

01:56.217 --> 01:58.389
CONGRATULATIONS.
WHAT A GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENT.

01:58.389 --> 02:01.422
IS THIS REALLY A GOOD IDEA?

02:01.422 --> 02:02.553
I MADE THIS TO CHEER YOU UP.

02:02.553 --> 02:04.195
I PASSED.

02:04.195 --> 02:06.697
I'LL SAVE IT FOR
YOUR REPORT CARD.

02:08.299 --> 02:12.763
I CANNOT BELIEVE MY LITTLE
BOY'S GONNA BE DRIVING.

02:12.763 --> 02:14.665
YOU ARE GROWING UP
SO FAST!
NOT THE HAIR!

02:14.665 --> 02:16.537
NOT THE HAIR!

02:16.537 --> 02:17.568
AHH!
OHH!

02:17.568 --> 02:19.840
MAN!

02:19.840 --> 02:22.443
I STILL REMEMBER WHEN
YOU WERE JUST A LITTLE TYKE,

02:22.443 --> 02:24.775
MOTORING AROUND
IN THAT TOY CAR OF YOURS.

02:26.917 --> 02:30.651
YOU ARE GETTING TO BE
SUCH A GOOD DRIVER!

02:30.651 --> 02:33.554
WHOA! LOOK AT
BENNETT BACK THEN.

02:33.554 --> 02:37.428
LOOKS LIKE A BEARDED COLLIE
I USED TO DATE.

02:37.428 --> 02:39.730
I WONDER WHAT
HAPPENED TO HER?

02:39.730 --> 02:41.632
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU!

02:41.632 --> 02:43.664
NOT THE HAIR!
NOT THE HAIR!

02:45.566 --> 02:47.798
OH, MAN!

02:48.869 --> 02:50.641
THIS IS THE FIRST
BIG MILESTONE

02:50.641 --> 02:52.473
SINCE OUR
TWO FAMILIES MERGED,

02:52.473 --> 02:55.446
MUCH LIKE TYLER WILL BE
MERGING ON THE FREEWAY.

02:55.446 --> 02:57.548
HA HA! GOOD ONE, ELLEN.

02:57.548 --> 02:59.210
WHADDYA SAY
WE ALL GO OUT FOR PIZZA

02:59.210 --> 03:01.382
TO CELEBRATE
THAT CLEVER WORDPLAY,

03:01.382 --> 03:02.953
AND TYLER BEING ABLE
TO DRIVE.

03:02.953 --> 03:04.385
All: YEEAAHHH!

03:04.385 --> 03:05.386
I'LL DRIVE!

03:05.386 --> 03:06.687
All: NOOOO!

03:06.687 --> 03:08.489
YOU NEED TO PRACTICE FIRST.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.861
COME ON, WHY DO I
NEED TO PRACTICE?

03:10.861 --> 03:13.764
BECAUSE WE LOVE YOU,
AND WE CARE ABOUT YOU,

03:13.764 --> 03:15.566
AND WE DON'T WANT
ANYTHING TO HAPPEN TO US.

03:17.528 --> 03:20.231
Stan: YAY, PIZZA!
PIZZA WITH THE FAMILY!

03:20.231 --> 03:22.333
PEPPERONI, HERE I--

03:22.333 --> 03:24.305
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY FORGOT ME.

03:24.305 --> 03:25.536
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

03:25.536 --> 03:27.207
WAIT! THEY'RE COMING
BACK FOR ME.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.779
OH, I KNEW THEY WOULD!

03:28.779 --> 03:31.282
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE FORGOT YOU.

03:31.282 --> 03:32.613
I KNOW. CRAZY, RIGHT?

03:32.613 --> 03:34.785
LET'S GET OUTTA HERE, PAL.

03:34.785 --> 03:36.287
COME ON, CHLOE.

03:36.287 --> 03:38.619
HA!

03:38.619 --> 03:40.921
AND I CALLED YOU PAL!

03:42.623 --> 03:45.626
ONCE AGAIN,
THEY TREAT ME LIKE A DOG.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.628
WHY DON'T THEY SEE
I'M JUST LIKE THEY ARE?

03:47.628 --> 03:49.800
IF YOU PRICK ME,
DO I NOT BLEED?

03:49.800 --> 03:53.634
IF I DREAM OF CHASING RABBITS,
DO I NOT RUN IN PLACE?

03:53.634 --> 03:56.337
IT MAKES ME SO MAD,
I JUST WANNA--

03:56.337 --> 03:58.339
UGH! I WANNA--!

03:58.339 --> 04:00.671
MM! HA HA!

04:00.671 --> 04:03.814
THAT'LL SHOW THEM
I'M MORE THAN A DOG!

04:03.814 --> 04:06.747
WAIT, DID I JUST UNDERMINE
MY OWN ARGUMENT?

04:06.747 --> 04:09.019
WHO CARES? IT'S FUN!

04:12.653 --> 04:14.885
HEY, THANKS FOR DOING
THIS LESSON WITH ME NOW.

04:14.885 --> 04:17.928
I KNOW AFTER PIZZA,
YOU USUALLY LIKE TO
UNBUCKLE YOUR BELT,

04:17.928 --> 04:20.731
MAKE THAT NOISE,
AND GO RIGHT TO SLEEP.

04:20.731 --> 04:24.765
DONE, DONE, AND LATER.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.838
OKAY, YOU NEED TO
CHECK YOUR MIRRORS
EVERY TWO TO FIVE SECONDS.

04:27.838 --> 04:31.001
HANDS AT TEN AND TWO.
ALWAYS BE SCANNING
YOUR SURROUNDINGS.

04:31.001 --> 04:32.473
KEEP YOUR EYES MOVING.

04:32.473 --> 04:33.474
THAT'S FIVE SECONDS!

04:33.474 --> 04:34.805
CHECK THE MIRROR,
CHECK THE MIRROR!

04:34.805 --> 04:36.847
DAD, THIS IS JUST LIKE
WHEN I WAS LITTLE!

04:36.847 --> 04:38.549
ALWAYS BE SCANNING
YOUR SURROUNDINGS,

04:38.549 --> 04:39.850
KEEP YOUR EYES MOVING.

04:39.850 --> 04:41.482
HANDS AT TEN AND TWO.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.283
CHECK THE MIRROR,
CHECK THE MIRROR.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.916
I DON'T HAVE A MIRROR!

04:45.916 --> 04:47.358
I SAID TEN AND TWO.

04:47.358 --> 04:50.421
I BELIEVE THAT IS
NINE AND 1:45.

04:50.421 --> 04:52.292
WHEN CAN I DRIVE
BY MYSELF?

04:52.292 --> 04:54.995
LOOK, SON, I-I KNOW
YOU'RE FRUSTRATED, OKAY,

04:54.995 --> 04:57.698
BUT IT'S CALLED A LEARNER'S
PERMIT FOR A REASON.

04:57.698 --> 05:00.331
EYES ON THE ROAD!
DAD...

05:00.331 --> 05:02.403
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?
OF COURSE.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.405
WHEN CAN I START THE ENGINE?

05:05.476 --> 05:07.538
LOVE THE EAGER BEAVER
ATTITUDE,

05:07.538 --> 05:10.781
BUT LET'S NOT JUMP
THREE WEEKS AHEAD
IN MY LESSON PLAN.

05:10.781 --> 05:11.912
CHECK THE MIRROR!
CHECK THE MIRROR!

05:11.912 --> 05:13.884
( overlapping shouts )

05:13.884 --> 05:16.417
WE'RE NOT EVEN DRIVING!
OH, WE'VE CRASHED!

05:16.417 --> 05:18.889
THERE'S THE AIRBAG!
THERE'S THE SIDE ONE!

05:18.889 --> 05:20.851
HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY!

05:20.851 --> 05:23.554
THANKS SO MUCH FOR DOING
THIS LESSON WITH ME.

05:23.554 --> 05:25.626
DAD WOULDN'T EVEN
LET ME START THE CAR.

05:25.626 --> 05:30.000
OHH! OHHH!

05:30.000 --> 05:32.062
( comical shrieking )

05:32.062 --> 05:34.735
MOM, THAT'S REALLY
DISTRACTING WHILE
I'M DRIVING.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.467
OKAY. SORRY.

05:36.467 --> 05:38.869
DIDN'T MEAN FOR
MY WILL TO LIVE
TO DISTRACT YOU.

05:38.869 --> 05:41.812
OHH! OHH! OHHHH!
( pumping foot )

05:41.812 --> 05:44.745
WHY ARE YOU PUMPING
AN IMAGINARY BRAKE PEDAL?
IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.

05:44.745 --> 05:47.347
YOU THINK
I DON'T KNOW THAT?!

05:47.347 --> 05:49.880
OH, HERE'S
ANOTHER MILESTONE--

05:49.880 --> 05:52.453
MY FIRST TERROR SWEAT.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.785
YAY!

05:54.785 --> 05:57.788
THIS IS JUST LIKE
THE FIRST MEMORY I EVER HAD--

05:57.788 --> 05:59.960
SOME NUT JOB
ALMOST RAN OVER ME.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.392
WHAT DO YOU THINK, AVERY?

06:01.392 --> 06:03.564
WANNA GO AROUND THE PARK
ONE MORE TIME?

06:03.564 --> 06:05.436
CHECK OUT ELLEN'S RED HAIR.

06:05.436 --> 06:08.999
REMINDS ME OF AN IRISH
SETTER I USED TO DATE.

06:08.999 --> 06:10.901
WONDER WHAT HAPPENED
TO HER?

06:10.901 --> 06:13.774
TEN AND TWO!
TEN AND TWO!

06:17.648 --> 06:20.481
TYLER DRIVES JUST LIKE
THAT LITTLE MANIAC,

06:20.481 --> 06:23.514
AND THERE IS NO WAY HE KNOWS
THE RULES OF THE ROAD.

06:23.514 --> 06:26.386
WHEN TWO VEHICLES MEET
ON A STEEP MOUNTAIN ROAD

06:26.386 --> 06:28.889
WHERE NEITHER CAN PASS,
WHO HAS THE RIGHT-OF-WAY,

06:28.889 --> 06:30.691
THE UPHILL OR
THE DOWNHILL VEHICLE?

06:30.691 --> 06:33.023
DO YOU KNOW?
DO YOU EVEN KNOW?

06:33.023 --> 06:35.526
WHO CARES?
EVERYONE IN THE TWO CARS...

06:35.526 --> 06:37.167
THAT JUST PLUMMETED OFF
THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN

06:37.167 --> 06:38.969
IF YOU WERE
DRIVING ONE OF THEM.

06:38.969 --> 06:41.932
NOW, KIDS, IT'S IMPORTANT
FOR THE DRIVER TO REMAIN
CALM AND FOCUSED,

06:41.932 --> 06:43.634
SO LET'S
NOT DO ANYTHING TO--

06:43.634 --> 06:44.975
TEN AND TWO!
TEN AND TWO!

06:44.975 --> 06:46.937
Ellen:
AAH! AAH! AAH!

06:46.937 --> 06:49.409
YOU ARE ALL DRIVING ME
CRAZY WITH YOUR NERVOUSNESS

06:49.409 --> 06:51.982
AND OVER-COACHING
AND TALKING ABOUT THINGS
THAT DON'T EXIST,

06:51.982 --> 06:53.413
LIKE ROADS ON MOUNTAINS.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.517
I WISH I COULD
JUST DRIVE BY MYSELF.

06:56.517 --> 06:59.419
SO DO I. WHY DO I
EVEN HAVE TO BE HERE?

06:59.419 --> 07:01.121
CHLOE'S NOT HERE.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.753
Bennett and Ellen:
CHLOE!

07:02.753 --> 07:04.955
WE FORGOT CHLOE,
AGAIN!

07:04.955 --> 07:06.927
DRIVE HOME, QUICK.
BUT SLOWLY.

07:12.633 --> 07:15.666
HERE'S A PICTURE OF
TYLER WHEN HE WAS THREE.

07:15.666 --> 07:18.769
Both: OHH!

07:18.769 --> 07:21.171
HERE'S ONE OF AVERY
WHEN SHE WAS TWO.

07:21.171 --> 07:23.844
Both: OHH!

07:23.844 --> 07:27.177
THIS TEA IS SO DELICIOUS.

07:27.177 --> 07:29.720
Both: MMM!

07:29.720 --> 07:30.951
IT'S FUNNY ISN'T IT, HON?

07:30.951 --> 07:32.953
THINGS LIKE TYLER
LEARNING HOW TO DRIVE,

07:32.953 --> 07:35.085
IT REALLY MAKES YOU MISS
WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE.

07:35.085 --> 07:37.958
OH, YEAH.
YOU JUST WISH
YOU COULD HAVE MORE OF IT.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.791
DADDY?
NOT NOW, SWEETIE.
WE'RE LOOKING AT PICTURES.

07:42.933 --> 07:45.596
OH, WOW.
HERE IS ONE OF TYLER

07:45.596 --> 07:48.839
AND THAT LITTLE TOY CAR
HE USED TO DRIVE AROUND
THE NEIGHBORHOOD PARK.

07:48.839 --> 07:51.602
OH, AVERY AND I USED
TO GO TO THAT PARK
WHEN SHE WAS LITTLE.

07:51.602 --> 07:54.905
OHH! THIS ONE DAY,
WE RAN INTO THE MOST
OBNOXIOUS MAN.

07:54.905 --> 07:57.878
TEN AND TWO!
TEN AND TWO!

07:57.878 --> 07:59.209
WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING!

07:59.209 --> 08:02.583
EASY, LADY.
WE GOT AS MUCH RIGHT
TO BE HERE AS YOU DO.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.215
NOT IF YOU'RE GONNA
DRIVE YOUR KID AROUND
LIKE A MANIAC.

08:05.215 --> 08:08.158
Stan: HOW CAN THEY NOT
REMEMBER THEY MET BEFORE?

08:08.158 --> 08:10.991
SEE, THIS IS WHY
DOGS SNIFF BUTTS.

08:12.162 --> 08:14.695
I PITY THE POOR SLOB
THAT'S MARRIED TO HER.

08:14.695 --> 08:18.699
WELL, IF I NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN,
IT'LL BE TOO SOON.

08:18.699 --> 08:21.872
THAT PARK ATTRACTED
ALL KINDS OF WEIRDOES
IN THOSE DAYS.

08:21.872 --> 08:24.575
UGH! THERE WAS THIS ONE
ANNOYING WOMAN.

08:24.575 --> 08:27.137
YOU WOULD HAVE HATED HER!
OH, YEAH!

08:27.137 --> 08:29.039
AH, BUT TYLER
WAS SO MUCH FUN.

08:29.039 --> 08:30.941
YEAH, I REALLY WISH
I WOULD HAVE SAVORED

08:30.941 --> 08:32.883
THOSE DAYS WITH AVERY
WHEN SHE WAS LITTLE.

08:32.883 --> 08:34.845
WELL, THOSE DAYS ARE GONE,

08:34.845 --> 08:37.287
AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH
YOU MISS 'EM, YOU JUST
CAN'T GET 'EM BACK.

08:37.287 --> 08:40.651
I HAVE A QUESTION.
CHLOE, WHAT DID WE SAY
ABOUT INTERRUPTING?

08:43.924 --> 08:46.957
HEY, CHLOE'S THAT AGE!
WE COULD SAVOR HER!

08:46.957 --> 08:48.759
CHLOE!

08:48.759 --> 08:50.731
CHLOE! CHLOE!
SWEETHEART, COME ON.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.603
OKAY. HONEY, WE LOVE YOU,

08:52.603 --> 08:54.935
AND WE WANNA HERE
EVERYTHING YOU HAVE TO SAY.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.607
NOW, WHAT WAS YOUR QUESTION?

08:56.607 --> 08:59.670
MAKE IT CUTE!
NO PRESSURE. GO!

08:59.670 --> 09:03.043
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FLUSH
A TENNIS BALL DOWN THE TOILET?

09:03.043 --> 09:06.917
( crashing sound )

09:06.917 --> 09:09.179
NEVER MIND!

09:12.182 --> 09:14.224
Stan: NO DOGS
ON THE COUCH, HUH?

09:15.886 --> 09:17.958
YEAH, I DON'T THINK SO.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.890
I'M ON THE COUCH!

09:19.890 --> 09:23.233
HEY, LOOK AT ME!
I'M WALKIN' ON THE COUCH!

09:23.233 --> 09:25.565
I'M SHEDDING
ON THE COUCH!

09:25.565 --> 09:27.698
WHOA-HO-HO YEAH!

09:29.299 --> 09:30.270
OH, NO!

09:38.078 --> 09:40.010
WHERE'S THE REST
OF THE FAMILY?

09:40.010 --> 09:42.282
UH, THEY WENT OUT
FOR ICE CREAM.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.915
SO... THEY'RE NOT
COMING BACK FOR A WHILE?

09:44.915 --> 09:46.186
( sighs ) NOPE.

09:46.186 --> 09:49.189
I'M WALKING ON THE COUCH!

09:49.189 --> 09:51.261
SO WHY DIDN'T
YOU GO WITH THEM?

09:51.261 --> 09:53.864
WELL, THEY WOULDN'T
LET ME DRIVE, SO
WHAT'S THE POINT?

09:53.864 --> 09:55.826
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL
ABOUT DRIVING?

09:55.826 --> 09:57.668
STAN, IT'S A HUGE DEAL.

09:57.668 --> 09:59.670
WHEN YOU CAN DRIVE,
YOU'RE FREE.

09:59.670 --> 10:01.331
YOU HAVE DIGNITY.

10:01.331 --> 10:03.173
IT'S LIKE YOU'VE BEEN
ACCEPTED INTO THE WORLD.

10:03.173 --> 10:06.076
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE BEING
TREATED LIKE A REAL PERSON.

10:06.076 --> 10:08.308
LIKE A REAL PERSON, HUH?

10:08.308 --> 10:09.910
OH, YEAH, IT'S THE BEST!

10:09.910 --> 10:13.243
IF HE WERE SMARTER,
HE WOULD HAVE SEEN
WHERE THIS WAS GOING.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.249
AH! I DO FEEL LIKE
A REAL PERSON!

10:19.249 --> 10:21.091
THIS IS AWESOME!

10:21.091 --> 10:23.694
JUST ME
AND THE OPEN ROAD, BABY!

10:23.694 --> 10:26.256
I GET IT NOW.
THIS IS FREEDOM.

10:26.256 --> 10:29.900
THIS IS GONNA MAKE IT
SO MUCH EASIER TO CHASE
THE MAILMAN!

10:31.762 --> 10:34.104
HO HO HO! YEAH!

10:34.104 --> 10:35.405
THAT'S THE TICKET!

10:35.405 --> 10:37.768
WHY DOESN'T EVERYBODY
DO THIS WHEN THEY DRIVE?

10:37.768 --> 10:39.309
WHOO-HOO-HOO-HOO!

10:39.309 --> 10:41.311
( crash )

10:41.311 --> 10:43.874
WHERE'S THE BLUE POOP BAG
WHEN YOU NEED ONE?

10:47.918 --> 10:50.981
DID YOU ASK YOUR PARENTS?
OKAY, FINE, I'LL ASK.

10:50.981 --> 10:53.383
HEY, DAD, CAN YOU
TAKE LINDSEY AND ME
FRIDAY NIGHT

10:53.383 --> 10:56.957
TO SEE NECROPOLIS HIGH II:
ETERNAL PROMNATION?

10:56.957 --> 11:00.030
I'M SORRY, WE'VE GOT
A BENEFIT AUCTION
TO SAVE THE PLANET.

11:00.030 --> 11:02.392
HE HAS SOME STUPID THING
THAT NIGHT.

11:03.894 --> 11:06.036
I'LL ASK. HOW 'BOUT
SATURDAY AFTERNOON?

11:06.036 --> 11:08.668
NOPE. CHLOE'S DANCE
RECITAL'S SATURDAY.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.771
WE HAVE TO WATCH MY SISTER
BUMP INTO HER FRIENDS

11:10.771 --> 11:12.342
ON STAGE FOR 10 MINUTES,

11:12.342 --> 11:14.444
AND THEN GIVE HER FLOWERS.

11:14.444 --> 11:17.978
HEY, SHE MAY BUMP,
BUT SHE NEVER GOES DOWN,

11:17.978 --> 11:19.850
AND THAT'S WHY
WE GIVE HER FLOWERS.

11:19.850 --> 11:23.183
( sighs ) WELL, I GUESS
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO GO SEE THE MOVIE THIS WEEK.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.856
BUT TYLER JUST GOT
HIS LEARNER'S PERMIT,

11:25.856 --> 11:28.318
AND SOON HE'LL BE
ABLE TO DRIVE US.

11:28.318 --> 11:30.320
NO, NO, NO, HE PASSED.

11:30.320 --> 11:32.863
NO, HE DID.

11:32.863 --> 11:36.326
YEAH, I KNOW. AT THIS RATE,
THEY'LL BE LETTING FISH DRIVE.

11:36.326 --> 11:37.968
ALL RIGHT, BYE.

11:39.329 --> 11:43.333
OH, HEY, MY STEPBROTHER
FROM ANOTHER MOTHER.

11:43.333 --> 11:46.706
I WAS JUST BRAGGING
ABOUT YOU ON THE PHONE.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.739
I'M NOT DRIVING YOU ANYWHERE.

11:48.739 --> 11:50.440
'CAUSE YOU'LL BE
DRIVING ME TO THE ZOO,

11:50.440 --> 11:53.343
AND THEN HOME,
AND THEN BACK TO THE ZOO,

11:53.343 --> 11:56.416
'CAUSE I ALWAYS LAY
MY SWEATSHIRT BY THE RHINOS.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.418
I'M NOT DRIVING
EITHER OF YOU.

11:58.418 --> 11:59.950
TYLER, AS SOON AS
IT'S LEGAL,

11:59.950 --> 12:02.492
YOU'RE GONNA BE DRIVING
EVERYBODY EVERYWHERE.

12:02.492 --> 12:04.124
MY CHAUFFEUR DAYS
ARE OVER.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.126
THAT'S NOT FAIR!
THE FAIR'S IN POMONA...

12:06.126 --> 12:09.259
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE DRIVING
THE GIRLS THERE AS WELL.

12:09.259 --> 12:13.063
( overlapping chatter )
OKAY, PEOPLE!

12:13.063 --> 12:14.464
WE'VE GOT
A MAJOR SITUATION.

12:14.464 --> 12:16.807
SOMEONE CRASHED THE CAR.

12:18.869 --> 12:20.240
WHY IS EVERYONE
LOOKING AT ME?

12:20.240 --> 12:22.242
MOM SAID SOMEONE
CRASHED THE CAR.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.244
YOU OBVIOUSLY DID IT,
SO WE'RE LOOKIN' AT YOU.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.515
PRETTY BASIC STUFF.

12:27.177 --> 12:28.518
I THINK I'M IN THE CLEAR.

12:28.518 --> 12:29.850
THEY BLAME A LOT
OF THINGS ON THE DOG,

12:29.850 --> 12:32.422
BUT CRASHING CARS IS
USUALLY NOT ONE OF THEM.

12:34.084 --> 12:37.888
AW! THIS IS GONNA
COST A FORTUNE!

12:37.888 --> 12:40.330
THERE IS A TREE
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD!

12:40.330 --> 12:43.433
ON THE PLUS SIDE,
IT'LL BE EASIER TO FIND
IN THE PARKING LOT.

12:45.095 --> 12:47.097
DID YOU THINK
WE WOULDN'T FIND OUT?

12:47.097 --> 12:50.170
I JUST FOUND OUT.
I DIDN'T CRASH THE CAR!

12:50.170 --> 12:52.142
I DIDN'T DO IT.
MOM DIDN'T DO IT.

12:52.142 --> 12:53.944
DOESN'T LEAVE
A LOT OF OPTIONS.

12:53.944 --> 12:55.906
YEAH, YOU SAID YOU
WANTED TO DRIVE ALONE

12:55.906 --> 12:58.008
WITHOUT US BUGGING YOU.
OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S WHAT YOU DID.

12:58.008 --> 13:00.350
( sighs ) THAT'S IT.
YOU'RE NOT DRIVING ANYMORE.

13:00.350 --> 13:03.113
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
WERE YOUR HANDS EVEN
AT TEN AND TWO?

13:03.113 --> 13:05.515
I WASN'T EVEN DRIVING!

13:05.515 --> 13:07.457
OH! NOW I FEEL BAD
FOR TYLER.

13:07.457 --> 13:10.120
WHY'D HE HAVE TO GO
AND CRASH THE CAR?

13:10.120 --> 13:13.023
OH. RIGHT.

13:13.023 --> 13:15.495
WHY DO YOU ASSUME IT WAS ME?
MAYBE AVERY DID IT.

13:15.495 --> 13:19.069
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.
I BROKE A RULE
AND CRASHED A CAR.

13:19.069 --> 13:23.073
I ALSO KICKED A BUNNY
AND BEAT A CLOWN WITH
ITS OWN GIANT SHOE.

13:24.434 --> 13:25.876
WELL, WHAT ABOUT CHLOE?

13:25.876 --> 13:27.807
SHE'S ALWAYS DOING STUFF
SHE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.440
I NEVER EVEN THOUGHT
OF DRIVING THE CAR--

13:30.440 --> 13:32.913
TILL NOW!

13:32.913 --> 13:35.385
Both: NOOOO!

13:35.385 --> 13:39.389
TYLER! COME ON!
ACCUSING YOUR SISTERS
LIKE THAT?

13:39.389 --> 13:41.821
I MEAN, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST SAY THE DOG DID IT?

13:41.821 --> 13:45.595
GO BACK TO THE LITTLE GIRL.
I-I DON'T THINK SHE'S BEEN
QUESTIONED THOROUGHLY.

13:45.595 --> 13:48.528
THAT'S IT. SINCE YOU
WON'T EVEN ACCEPT
RESPONSIBILITY,

13:48.528 --> 13:50.030
YOU'RE NOT DRIVING...

13:50.030 --> 13:52.102
AND YOU'RE GROUNDED
FOR A MONTH!

13:52.102 --> 13:53.563
YOU NEVER BELIEVE ME!

13:53.563 --> 13:55.435
YES,
I FLOODED THE BASEMENT,

13:55.435 --> 13:56.937
AND, YEAH, I BROKE
THE KITCHEN WINDOW,

13:56.937 --> 13:58.438
AND, YEAH, I BLEW UP
THE MICROWAVE,

13:58.438 --> 13:59.569
BUT I DIDN'T CRASH THE CAR!

13:59.569 --> 14:01.611
YOU FLOODED THE BASEMENT?!
YOU BLEW UP THE MICROWAVE?!

14:01.611 --> 14:04.214
OH, SO NOW YOU BELIEVE ME!

14:04.214 --> 14:06.316
OH, THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

14:06.316 --> 14:08.178
IF ONLY I NEVER DROVE
THE CAR

14:08.178 --> 14:10.180
OR NEVER STUCK MY HEAD
OUT THE WINDOW--

14:10.180 --> 14:12.923
NO, THAT WAS COOL.
I-I WOULD DO THAT AGAIN.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.094
AND THE COOL THING
ABOUT AN ART WALL

14:24.094 --> 14:26.136
IS I CAN PAINT
WHATEVER I WANT.

14:26.136 --> 14:28.068
I HAVE AN ART WALL
IN MY ROOM, TOO.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.470
MOM AND DAD GAVE ME
PERMISSION TO DO THIS.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.142
OH.

14:32.142 --> 14:34.975
CAN YOU HELP ME
MOVE MY DRESSER?

14:34.975 --> 14:38.308
YOU GUYS ARE TRAITORS.
WHAT DID I DO?

14:38.308 --> 14:40.610
NEITHER OF YOU BELIEVED
I DIDN'T CRASH THE CAR.

14:40.610 --> 14:43.883
I'M MUST A KID. I BELIEVE
WHAT EVERYONE ELSE BELIEVES.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.486
AND EVERYONE ELSE BELIEVES
THAT YOU DID IT.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.158
TYLER, IT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT MAKES SENSE.

14:48.158 --> 14:50.190
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
YOU SHOULD'VE HAD MY BACK.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.422
( overlapping arguments )

14:52.422 --> 14:54.664
AH, THEY'RE FIGHTING
BECAUSE OF ME!

14:54.664 --> 14:56.326
THIS IS HORRIBLE!

14:56.326 --> 14:58.999
IF THIS GOES ON
MUCH LONGER, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO CONFESS.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.430
AH, BUT I'M SURE
IT'LL BLOW OVER.

15:00.430 --> 15:02.172
I'M SURE THEY'LL MAKE UP.

15:02.172 --> 15:04.174
( overlapping shouts )

15:04.174 --> 15:06.006
LOOKS LIKE
IT'S WINDING DOWN!

15:06.006 --> 15:08.908
THOSE ARE SCREAMS
OF LOVE, RIGHT?

15:08.908 --> 15:10.941
DON'T TOUCH MY HAIR!
DO NOT TOUCH--!

15:10.941 --> 15:12.912
( sharp whistle )

15:12.912 --> 15:15.645
HE CAN WHISTLE, TOO?

15:15.645 --> 15:17.487
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.
I DID IT.

15:17.487 --> 15:21.221
I WANTED TO BE LIKE
A PERSON, AND I CRASHED
THE CAR, OKAY?

15:21.221 --> 15:22.953
YOU DID WHAT?
STAN!

15:22.953 --> 15:25.125
I'M SORRY,
BUT IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.998
IF IT'S NOT SAFE TO DRIVE
WITH YOUR HEAD OUT THE WINDOW,

15:27.998 --> 15:30.000
THEN THEY SHOULDN'T
LET DOGS DRIVE.

15:30.000 --> 15:30.930
THEY DON'T!

15:30.930 --> 15:32.402
THEN WHY
DO I HAVE A LICENSE?

15:32.402 --> 15:34.264
A DOG LICENSE!

15:34.264 --> 15:36.036
WHATEVER!

15:36.036 --> 15:39.239
TYLER, I JUST ASSUMED
IT WAS YOU.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.111
I'M REALLY SORRY.

15:41.111 --> 15:44.944
I'M NOT.
STILL JUST A KID.

15:44.944 --> 15:48.118
STAN, YOU CAN'T DRIVE.
YOU'RE A DOG.

15:48.118 --> 15:49.980
OH, RIGHT.
I'M JUST A DOG.

15:49.980 --> 15:52.152
I CAN'T GO FOR A WALK
WITHOUT A LEASH.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.024
I-I CAN'T DRIVE A CAR.

15:54.024 --> 15:55.485
I CAN'T REPROGRAM THE DVR.

15:55.485 --> 15:59.259
WAIT-- YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO RECORDED TEN SHOWINGS
OF MEET THE PARENTS?

15:59.259 --> 16:03.563
OH HO! I'M A SUCKER
FOR ANYTHING WITH
"MEAT" IN THE TITLE.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.065
STUPID HOMONYMS.

16:06.496 --> 16:09.239
WE HAVE BIGGER PROBLEMS
THAN THE DVR.

16:09.239 --> 16:10.700
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

16:10.700 --> 16:13.403
IT'S NOT FAIR FOR ME
TO GET PUNISHED FOR THIS.

16:13.403 --> 16:15.175
WELL, WE CAN'T SAY
STAN DID IT.

16:15.175 --> 16:18.048
WE HAVE TO KEEP THE SECRET
THAT STAN IS SPECIAL,

16:18.048 --> 16:21.181
OR HE'LL GET TAKEN AWAY
AND EXPERIMENTED ON.

16:21.181 --> 16:24.114
THEN I GUESS I CAN'T
DRIVE, AND I'M GROUNDED
FOR A MONTH.

16:24.114 --> 16:26.216
NO, TYLER, THAT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN EITHER.

16:26.216 --> 16:28.758
LOOK, SOMEONE ELSE
NEEDS TO CONFESS,

16:28.758 --> 16:30.660
SOMEONE MOM AND DAD
WON'T BE AS HARD ON.

16:30.660 --> 16:34.464
AND I'M PERFECTLY PREPARED
TO STEP FORWARD

16:34.464 --> 16:37.627
AND SAY THAT CHLOE DID IT.
WHAT?! WHY ME?

16:37.627 --> 16:41.171
THEY'LL GO THE EASIEST ON YOU.
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF--
YOU'RE JUST A KID.

16:41.171 --> 16:44.104
I NEVER SAID THAT.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.606
CHLOE, YOU JUST HAVE
TO MAKE THAT CUTE
LITTLE POUTY FACE,

16:46.606 --> 16:48.108
BAT THOSE LITTLE EYELASHES.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.009
YOU'LL GET
AWAY WITH ANYTHING.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.542
PLEASE DON'T LET AVERY
SAY I DID IT.

16:54.344 --> 16:56.246
WELL, DON'T WORRY,
I WON'T.

16:56.246 --> 16:58.017
SEE?

17:00.420 --> 17:04.154
HEY, WAIT, HAVE ANY OF YOU
EVER SEEN THE MOVIE SPARTACUS?

17:05.495 --> 17:07.127
OF COURSE NOT.

17:08.628 --> 17:10.760
WELL, THERE'S THIS
REBEL SLAVE NAMED SPARTACUS,

17:10.760 --> 17:12.802
AND THE ROMANS
WANT TO FIND HIM,

17:12.802 --> 17:14.704
BUT ALL OF HIS FRIENDS
STAND UP AND SAY,

17:14.704 --> 17:16.336
"I AM SPARTACUS!"

17:16.336 --> 17:19.739
"NO, I AM SPARTACUS!"
"NO, I AM SPARTACUS!"

17:19.739 --> 17:22.172
"NO, I AM--"
AND SO ON.

17:22.172 --> 17:25.745
SO... THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT
WHO THE REAL SPARTACUS WAS.

17:25.745 --> 17:27.046
SO WHAT HAPPENED THEN?

17:27.046 --> 17:28.348
THEY KILLED ALL OF THEM.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.250
OKAY, LET'S GIVE IT A TRY.

17:32.322 --> 17:34.324
HEY, DID YOU CALL
THE INSURANCE COMPANY?

17:34.324 --> 17:36.386
YEAH, THEY'RE SENDING
SOMEONE OUT TO TAKE PICTURES.

17:36.386 --> 17:37.787
OH, SHOULD I CHANGE?

17:37.787 --> 17:40.260
OF THE CAR.

17:41.491 --> 17:43.163
OF COURSE. I KNEW THAT.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.295
SO, I REALIZED I NEVER
SHOWED YOU THAT PHOTO

17:45.295 --> 17:47.137
OF ME
AND AVERY AT THE PARK.

17:47.137 --> 17:49.799
OH, YEAH, I NEVER SHOWED YOU
THE ONE OF ME AND TYLER.

17:49.799 --> 17:51.771
THIS IS THE MOMENT.
THEY'RE HOLDING THE PICTURES.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.443
NOTHING COULD
POSSIBLY STOP THEM

17:53.443 --> 17:56.106
FROM FIGURING OUT
THEY'VE MET BEFORE.

17:56.106 --> 17:57.607
I DID IT.

17:57.607 --> 17:58.808
DID WHAT?

17:58.808 --> 18:00.550
I CRASHED THE CAR.

18:00.550 --> 18:02.682
LOOK, I WAS JEALOUS
THAT TYLER WAS DRIVING,

18:02.682 --> 18:05.755
AND I WAS JUST GONNA
GO DOWN THE DRIVEWAY,
BUT I LOST CONTROL.

18:05.755 --> 18:07.257
HEY, DON'T LISTEN
TO HER, OKAY?

18:07.257 --> 18:09.789
I DID IT. I'M SORRY
I DENIED IT BEFORE,

18:09.789 --> 18:12.492
BUT I'M READY TO ACCEPT
FULL RESPONSIBILITY.

18:12.492 --> 18:13.693
I...

18:13.693 --> 18:15.595
AM ASPARAGUS.

18:17.127 --> 18:21.271
I WAS PLAYING IN THE CAR,
AND IT STARTED, AND I CRASHED.

18:21.271 --> 18:22.772
DON'T BE MAD.

18:24.874 --> 18:27.137
OKAY, WHAT IS
GOING ON HERE?

18:28.608 --> 18:30.580
THEY'RE DOING SPARTACUS!

18:30.580 --> 18:33.613
I'M PRETTY SURE
IT'S ASPARAGUS.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.216
THEY THINK
IF THEY ALL CONFESS,

18:36.216 --> 18:37.747
WE WON'T BE ABLE
TO TELL WHO DID IT.

18:37.747 --> 18:41.421
THAT IS SO SWEET THAT
THEY ARE STICKING UP
FOR EACH OTHER LIKE THAT.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.723
THEY ARE SUCH GOOD KIDS!
I KNOW!

18:43.723 --> 18:47.497
SERIOUSLY, THOUGH,
WHICH ONE OF YOU LITTLE
MONSTERS WRECKED THE CAR?

18:47.497 --> 18:49.128
( horn honks )

18:49.128 --> 18:50.260
( gasps )
THAT SOUNDS LIKE MY CAR!

18:50.260 --> 18:52.131
GO, GO!

18:58.168 --> 18:59.339
All: STAN!

18:59.339 --> 19:01.641
HERE GOES NOTHIN'!

19:03.343 --> 19:05.515
( crash )

19:05.515 --> 19:07.677
( audible reactions )

19:12.422 --> 19:14.424
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN WHAT
HAPPENED THE FIRST TIME--

19:14.424 --> 19:15.925
STAN GOT IN THE CAR.

19:15.925 --> 19:17.587
NONE OF YOU DID IT,
DID YOU?

19:17.587 --> 19:18.928
NO, WE DIDN'T.

19:18.928 --> 19:22.161
STAN'S JUST A DOG.
HE DOESN'T KNOW ANY BETTER.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.693
WE CAN'T EVEN
BE MAD AT HIM, HON.

19:23.693 --> 19:25.195
OH, I'LL FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO BE MAD.

19:25.195 --> 19:26.696
HE CHEWED UP
MY THROW PILLOWS,

19:26.696 --> 19:28.368
HE'S CRASHED MY CAR TWICE,

19:28.368 --> 19:30.940
AND HE GIVES ME DIRTY LOOKS
WHEN I DO MY BUTT FLEXES.

19:30.940 --> 19:36.276
AND CLENCH AND RELEASE,
AND CLENCH AND RELEASE.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.407
YOU SEE? YOU SEE?

19:39.309 --> 19:42.582
SO, UH, WHICH ONE OF YOU
LEFT THE CAR DOOR OPEN?

19:42.582 --> 19:44.914
IT WASN'T ME.
IT CERTAINLY WASN'T ME.

19:44.914 --> 19:47.257
OH, YOU'VE BEEN KNOWN
TO LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN.
NO, WHEN HAVE I EVER?

19:47.257 --> 19:50.260
GOOD BOY, STAN. YOU
REALLY CAME THROUGH FOR US.

19:50.260 --> 19:52.262
AND AVERY, THANKS
FOR HAVING MY BACK

19:52.262 --> 19:53.863
WITH THE WHOLE
SPARTACUS THING.

19:53.863 --> 19:56.526
SOMETIMES WE NEED
TO STICK TOGETHER--

19:56.526 --> 19:59.329
LIKE WHEN SOMEONE
NEEDS A RIDE SOMEWHERE!

19:59.329 --> 20:01.631
OKAY, I'LL DRIVE YOU
ANYWHERE YOU WANT TO GO.

20:01.631 --> 20:04.274
EXCEPT A MOUNTAIN ROAD.

20:04.274 --> 20:06.936
AND STAN, OH,
YOU WERE BRILLIANT.

20:06.936 --> 20:11.581
CAN I SAY YOU PAINTED
MY BEDROOM WALLS? PLEASE?

20:11.581 --> 20:12.812
SURE.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.914
I'D TAKE A HIT
FOR ANY OF THEM.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.317
THE KIDS
REALLY STOOD BY ME.

20:17.317 --> 20:19.589
THEY WERE LOYAL,
THEY WERE SELFLESS,

20:19.589 --> 20:22.322
THEY WERE PROTECTIVE.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.623
OH, MY GOSH--

20:23.623 --> 20:25.295
I WAS TRYING TO BE
LIKE A PERSON,

20:25.295 --> 20:26.996
AND THEY WERE
BEING LIKE DOGS.

20:26.996 --> 20:28.998
MAYBE WE'RE NOT
THAT FAR APART.

20:28.998 --> 20:30.600
SO NEXT TIME I DRIVE,

20:30.600 --> 20:32.862
MAYBE THEY'LL STICK
THEIR HEADS OUT THE WINDOW.

20:34.334 --> 20:37.307
THERE'S SOMETHING
FOR YOU TO CHEW ON.

20:37.307 --> 20:40.570
HEY! SOMETHING TO CHEW ON!

20:43.973 --> 20:45.975
THE LAST PIECE
THAT CONNECTS THEIR PAST

20:45.975 --> 20:48.848
IS HANGING OFF MY LIP.

20:48.848 --> 20:49.979
OH, WELL.

20:53.983 --> 20:55.855
OKAY, UH...

20:55.855 --> 20:58.288
NOW, WHAT ARE THE ODDS
THEY'LL THINK TYLER DID THIS?

21:04.364 --> 21:06.666
THIS IS SO GREAT
THAT WE'RE DOING THIS.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.898
WE ARE BUILDING
MEMORIES RIGHT NOW.

21:08.898 --> 21:10.800
I CAN'T WAIT
UNTIL IT'S LATER

21:10.800 --> 21:12.642
AND WE CAN
LOOK BACK ON THIS!

21:12.642 --> 21:15.274
HAVE MORE FUN! SMILE MORE!
SAY SOMETHING ADORABLE!

21:15.274 --> 21:16.946
WE NEED SOMETHING
TO SAVOR HERE.

21:16.946 --> 21:19.309
HOW DO YOU STOP THIS THING?

21:19.309 --> 21:21.381
OH, HOW PRECIOUS!

21:21.381 --> 21:23.483
HEY!

21:23.483 --> 21:25.014
THE DOG DID IT.

21:25.014 --> 21:27.787
WATCH WHERE
YOU'RE GOING, KID.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.459
HEY! DON'T YELL AT HER.

21:29.459 --> 21:31.290
YOU'RE RUINING OUR MOMENT.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.463
THEN MAYBE I OUGHT
TO YELL AT YOU.

21:33.463 --> 21:35.365
KEEP AN EYE
ON YOUR KID!

21:35.365 --> 21:38.368
I PITY THE POOR SLOB
WHO'S MARRIED TO HER.

21:38.368 --> 21:40.600
YEAH, IF I NEVER SEE HER
AGAIN, IT'LL BE TOO SOON.

21:42.972 --> 21:44.303
Both: NAH.

21:45.575 --> 21:47.577
SERIOUSLY,
AND YOU HAVE US AS PETS.
