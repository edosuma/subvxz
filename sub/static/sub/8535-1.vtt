01:25.797 --> 01:28.838
Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?

01:28.917 --> 01:30.838
Oh, no.

01:46.079 --> 01:48.199
I love ballet.

01:49.960 --> 01:51.959
Now, I never had the body for it.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.721
Hey, you dance?

01:55.800 --> 01:58.360
I used to.

02:08.681 --> 02:11.081
I've got something for you.

02:13.482 --> 02:15.962
It's for love,
not luck.

02:16.042 --> 02:19.963
Because you don't need luck,
you dance like an angel.

02:20.043 --> 02:21.883
Mom.

02:21.964 --> 02:25.683
You're the best luck
I'll ever have.

02:32.405 --> 02:34.524
Are you okay?

02:34.605 --> 02:36.444
I kept messing up
these pirouettes.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.445
It's really frustrating,
but it'll be okay.

02:38.524 --> 02:40.685
My mom's going to be there.
She's going to drive me.

02:40.725 --> 02:43.246
You've nothing to worry about,
you're going to do absolutely fine.

02:43.285 --> 02:45.325
You're the best dancer
in Lemont.

02:45.406 --> 02:48.486
Lindsay, this is not Lemont.
This is Juilliard, New York City.

02:48.566 --> 02:50.405
- Do you want to pray?
- What?

02:50.486 --> 02:53.486
You're leaving for St. Louis. I'm
not gonna see you. We should pray.

02:53.526 --> 02:56.247
- Lindsay-
- Father, S.J. auditions today,

02:56.286 --> 02:58.206
let her do okay.

02:58.287 --> 03:00.368
We've got the Carson
wedding, the Dankowski party,

03:00.447 --> 03:03.687
two funerals and Jill
calls in sick today, of all days.

03:03.767 --> 03:08.328
Sara, I'm sorry. I have to handle
this, there isn't anybody else.

03:08.408 --> 03:10.648
- Mom, what about-
- Glynn? Do they want roses in this?

03:10.728 --> 03:14.169
- It doesn't say what color mums.
-Judy took that order, ask her.

03:14.249 --> 03:16.888
Mom? This is the hardest,
most important day of my life.

03:16.969 --> 03:20.409
You have to be there.
You promised.

03:20.489 --> 03:22.809
I know.

03:33.770 --> 03:36.371
- Excuse me, are you Sara Johnson?
- Yes.

03:36.451 --> 03:38.372
You're next.

03:57.813 --> 04:00.973
I'll be there, I promise,
before you audition.

04:11.494 --> 04:14.175
Is there anything you
would like to share with us...

04:14.255 --> 04:16.214
about your contemporary piece
before you begin?

04:16.295 --> 04:19.173
No, it's pretty
self-explanatory.

05:58.225 --> 06:00.105
Did you have
a good ride?

06:00.146 --> 06:02.546
I slept through
most of it.

06:05.146 --> 06:06.986
I guess you got stuff.

06:07.066 --> 06:09.186
Baggage?

06:09.267 --> 06:12.787
Three suitcases.
One big one.

06:24.868 --> 06:28.308
Sorry I had to split
so soon after the funeral.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.069
If I could have gotten out of
that gig in South Bend,

06:31.148 --> 06:33.429
I would have hung around
a lot longer.

06:33.509 --> 06:35.750
Guess it was pretty tough
Leaving all your friends.

06:35.789 --> 06:37.709
Uh-huh.

07:05.752 --> 07:07.672
Here we are.

07:08.673 --> 07:10.953
Put 'em anywhere.

07:10.993 --> 07:14.313
Give you the grand tour.

07:14.353 --> 07:16.233
It's not much of what
you're used to,

07:16.274 --> 07:19.033
but the water's hot
and the mice are friendly.

07:19.114 --> 07:21.634
Uh, bathroom.

07:23.714 --> 07:25.555
Kitchen, big kitchen.

07:27.555 --> 07:29.555
Uh...

07:31.035 --> 07:33.315
this is where I sleep.

07:33.355 --> 07:36.835
Didn't get a chance
to make the bed today.

07:36.875 --> 07:38.796
Where do I sleep?

07:41.796 --> 07:43.756
Nixon was probably in office...

07:43.836 --> 07:46.236
when they rolled this
off the assembly line, but, uh,

07:46.316 --> 07:49.077
there's a brand-new mattress
in there.

07:49.156 --> 07:51.357
Most of your clothes
should fit in here.

07:51.437 --> 07:53.798
Whatever's left over
can put in the hall closet.

07:53.878 --> 07:55.958
I know it's a little bit
out in the open, but...

07:56.038 --> 07:58.917
I didn't get a chance
to finish your room here.

08:02.198 --> 08:04.319
Yeah, I'll fix that.

08:07.119 --> 08:09.918
It's a work in progress.

08:10.998 --> 08:14.360
I'll have it up and running
in no time.

08:14.439 --> 08:17.000
A few minor adjustments.

08:20.961 --> 08:23.840
Well, I guess
I'll let you get unpacked.

08:44.563 --> 08:46.484
You don't have
to come in with me...

08:46.563 --> 08:49.802
- since I'm all set.
- I'm your father, I'm supposed to.

08:49.843 --> 08:52.363
You don't know where to go,
who to see.

08:52.443 --> 08:55.524
It's okay. I mean, I have done
this before, gone to school.

08:55.604 --> 09:00.324
All right, well, this is
the name they gave me.

09:00.404 --> 09:03.604
"Mrs. Gwynn.
Main office."

09:04.764 --> 09:07.765
I'll be back
to pick you up at 3.30.

09:07.845 --> 09:10.685
Okay, sure.
Whatever.

09:22.687 --> 09:25.848
- Hey, look at the white girl.
- Wassup, baby?

10:19.292 --> 10:24.533
My door is always open. And contrary
to hall rumor, you can talk to me.

10:25.813 --> 10:29.694
Do you have any
questions or concerns?

10:29.774 --> 10:31.853
No questions,
no answers.

10:33.533 --> 10:36.375
All right. This is Mr. Campbell's
class, and he's expecting you.

10:38.255 --> 10:41.135
Truman Capote. In Cold Blood...

10:41.215 --> 10:43.895
represents a complete turning point
in American history...

10:43.934 --> 10:48.976
and American literature-
you want to tell us why, Mr. Ricard?

10:49.055 --> 10:51.536
Gay rights.

10:51.615 --> 10:54.256
- The Com-pote dude who wrote it-
- Capote.

10:54.337 --> 10:55.895
- Capote?
- Capote.

10:55.976 --> 10:58.896
Sweet tooth. Straight-up fag,
Mr. C. I'm serious.

10:58.976 --> 11:01.697
- Flaming.

11:01.776 --> 11:04.817
Thank you very much. We can now
promote you up to kindergarten.

11:04.898 --> 11:07.978
Any body else?
Once, twice.

11:08.058 --> 11:12.057
Miss Johnson, I apologize
If any of this is over your head,

11:12.138 --> 11:14.578
but if you see me after class,
I'll give you some chapters.

11:14.658 --> 11:17.059
Anybody?
Come on.

11:17.138 --> 11:20.019
It's a non-fiction novel.
Capote mixed true events...

11:20.099 --> 11:24.099
with things that he couldn't
know so he made them up.

11:24.179 --> 11:26.020
He created a new genre.

11:27.900 --> 11:31.860
White folks back then felt safe.
Capote scared them.

11:31.940 --> 11:33.541
He took hard-core crime
out of the ghetto...

11:33.620 --> 11:36.780
and placed it in America's backyard,
that's what makes the book special.

11:36.861 --> 11:40.580
- Yeah, that's part of it.
- That's all of it.

11:40.661 --> 11:44.262
- We got a debate going on now.
- Capote wasn't the first.

11:44.341 --> 11:46.702
Richard Wright, James Baldwin
did the same thing.

11:46.781 --> 11:49.062
Wasn't nobody trying
to read them, though.

11:49.101 --> 11:52.462
A lot of people read them.

11:52.542 --> 11:54.943
A lot of people like who?

11:55.022 --> 11:57.023
You?

11:57.103 --> 12:00.942
- Didn't think so.
- Mr. C? Mr. C?

12:01.022 --> 12:03.583
- Yeah?
- Your girl needs to bone up.

12:03.663 --> 12:06.624
I think you need to give her
a pass to the library.

12:06.703 --> 12:09.544
We need to get a parent-teacher's
conference, something going on.

12:09.624 --> 12:11.504
Why don't you lend her yours?

12:11.584 --> 12:14.424
'Cause obviously,
you don't ever use it.

12:16.264 --> 12:18.785
Yo, Latrice, Mr. Jackson's
civics class?

12:18.825 --> 12:22.906
You will have a pop quiz.
It's mad hard, aright?

12:22.985 --> 12:24.866
Aright.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.947
That's how easy it is
to give to charity around here.

12:44.947 --> 12:46.828
Thanks.

12:46.868 --> 12:50.788
Don't put your shit
on the floor.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.909
I'm-

13:56.915 --> 13:58.755
So, here lam trying to study,
right?

13:58.835 --> 14:01.075
And he's crying and crying,
I can't get anything done-

14:04.916 --> 14:08.116
Yo, where were you
in math class? Man-

14:08.156 --> 14:11.317
It was so hard.
Life it blank, the whole thing.

14:11.396 --> 14:14.317
For real. And if you had been there,
I'd of had my notes from yesterday.

14:14.397 --> 14:16.877
I know you're new to the table,
but just look at this,

14:16.957 --> 14:20.437
we are the 2K generation...
and no one takes us seriously.

14:20.517 --> 14:23.717
We don't even take ourselves
seriously. And just look around,

14:23.798 --> 14:26.958
half the student body is DOA,
and that's from the neck up, Clara.

14:27.038 --> 14:28.879
Sara. It's Sara.

14:28.958 --> 14:32.279
Yeah, it's Sara.
You finished?

14:32.359 --> 14:34.038
Yes.

14:38.879 --> 14:41.760
- Thank you so much.
- Mm-hmm. No problem.

14:41.799 --> 14:43.680
You need to watch
where you sit, girl.

14:43.720 --> 14:46.840
Don't ever let me catch you at
that table again. And it's Chenille.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.201
Put your tray down here,
and let me introduce you...

14:51.280 --> 14:54.361
to some of the ladies
that I roll with.

14:56.442 --> 15:00.201
- It's just a little hip-hop.

15:00.281 --> 15:02.042
Come on.

15:03.682 --> 15:07.003
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Girls, this is Sara.

15:07.082 --> 15:09.803
Sara, this is Portia
and Tanisha.

15:09.883 --> 15:12.363
And this is Diggy.

15:12.442 --> 15:15.643
- She thinks she's down.
- Excuse me? I am down, okay.

15:15.682 --> 15:18.363
- Yeah, whatever.
- You said you knew how to play.

15:18.404 --> 15:21.244
Girl, that earring
is fresh as hell, did it hurt?

15:21.284 --> 15:23.004
Stick a pin
through your eyebrow,

15:23.084 --> 15:25.484
- see if it hurts.
- Asshole.

15:27.084 --> 15:31.005
Who? 'Cause in this crowd you're
going to have to be more specific.

15:31.044 --> 15:33.965
The guy sitting by the window
with the blue sweater.

15:34.046 --> 15:36.886
He's in my English class.
He think she's so smart and so cute.

15:36.965 --> 15:39.565
- Derek Reynolds?
- Oh, so you know him?

15:39.645 --> 15:42.486
Hell, yeah, I know him.
He's my brother.

15:43.766 --> 15:46.206
Oh.

15:46.247 --> 15:49.647
Well, he's not an asshole,
per se-

15:51.486 --> 15:54.487
Forget about it, girl.
It's all right.

15:54.567 --> 15:56.447
Don't even sweat it.

15:56.528 --> 15:59.288
- Yo, Derek. Hey, yo.
- Hey, man.

15:59.368 --> 16:02.648
Medicine man.

16:02.728 --> 16:05.128
What's up, Kai? Man, baby,
I was just asking about you,

16:05.207 --> 16:07.929
and I got a little emotional
too about you being back and all.

16:08.008 --> 16:10.849
Man, sit your punk ass down, fool.
Matter of fact, step your ass off.

16:10.889 --> 16:12.889
Give us some space.

16:12.969 --> 16:16.649
Man, why we- Everybody's
got a piece in the hook.

16:16.729 --> 16:21.050
You look good, man.
Who you stealing from? Nice jacket.

16:21.129 --> 16:23.930
What's up, man?
How'd it go with Mrs. Gwynn?

16:24.010 --> 16:28.091
Bullshit. "You're a smart boy,
you can learn from your mistakes.

16:28.171 --> 16:30.450
I'm here for you. "Yeah,
she's there for me, all right.

16:30.531 --> 16:33.091
But you're hangin' in, though.
You feeling strong?

16:33.131 --> 16:37.212
Strong about what? First week
back at home sweet high school?

16:37.291 --> 16:39.132
You enlisted in this shit.
I'm drafted.

16:39.212 --> 16:41.172
Judge said finish school
or finish your sentence.

16:41.252 --> 16:43.932
Like they both ain't
12 months of a long-ass time.

16:44.011 --> 16:46.692
But a year here is better than
another one served up at juvee.

16:46.733 --> 16:50.853
- At least we got chicks in here.
- Yeah, man.

16:50.933 --> 16:52.453
- I'll check you later, man.
- All right, man.

16:52.494 --> 16:55.173
See this honey.

16:59.894 --> 17:03.014
Hey, Sara.
Come in here a minute, will you?

17:10.374 --> 17:13.095
You've been working awhile in there.
You must be getting hungry.

17:13.135 --> 17:17.016
What do you say? Look...
"Swanson Hungry Man Dinners."

17:17.096 --> 17:20.455
They're the best.
Look, got every style.

17:20.535 --> 17:22.376
Animal, vegetable,
or mineral?

17:22.415 --> 17:24.576
I had a big lunch.

17:26.016 --> 17:28.056
All right, well...

17:28.137 --> 17:30.498
they're in here
if you change your mind.

17:32.657 --> 17:35.737
Unless your plan is
to starve yourself to death.

17:35.817 --> 17:38.378
It's not a plan. I just don't eat
when I'm not hungry.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.938
- Mom never let me eat that stuff.
- Okay.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.659
Hey, uh-

17:44.859 --> 17:47.658
Listen, uh-

17:47.698 --> 17:51.900
I got a gig downtown tonight.
What do you say?

17:51.979 --> 17:54.100
You haven't heard me
play for awhile.

17:54.180 --> 17:57.860
What do you say?
You want to come with me,

17:57.941 --> 18:00.699
and hang out, and maybe we'll
get a bite to eat afterwards?

18:00.780 --> 18:04.381
- It's a school night, Roy.
- Oh, yeah.

18:04.460 --> 18:06.341
It's a school night, yeah.

18:06.421 --> 18:08.902
I forgot.

18:08.981 --> 18:11.140
All right, then.
Well, I'll just go.

18:13.901 --> 18:18.502
And, uh, you can eat
or not eat.

18:18.582 --> 18:20.462
And I'll be back
when I'm back.

19:14.349 --> 19:17.868
Stepps is gonna be
off the hinges Friday night.

19:17.948 --> 19:20.828
I'm a bust a new move,
break in the new Jordans...

19:20.909 --> 19:22.789
and bring a little honey.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.310
- Why, your hand busy?

19:25.389 --> 19:29.229
If it wasn't for that attitude,
you could be the lucky girl.

19:29.308 --> 19:32.150
- I can see us right now, baby.
- Yeah, in your dreams.

19:32.229 --> 19:34.790
Help me, dog.
Defend me, man!

19:34.870 --> 19:36.711
I got my own problems,
Snook.

19:36.790 --> 19:40.071
Problems? What problems?
We ain't got no damn problems.

19:40.150 --> 19:43.710
You going to college, doctor college
after that. You the man, dog.

19:43.791 --> 19:46.511
He tripping off his acceptance
letter from Georgetown.

19:46.591 --> 19:49.832
No, I'm waiting for my letter.
I've been waiting.

19:58.952 --> 20:01.473
I could have been a doctor
too, you know what I'm saying?

20:01.552 --> 20:03.553
If it wasn't for that time
I got left back.

20:03.594 --> 20:07.513
"That time"? What, fifth
and sixth grade don't count?

20:07.592 --> 20:10.913
Why do you always try to make me
feel bad? I liked the fifth grade.

20:10.954 --> 20:14.474
- Hey, girl!
- Miss Barnett had this ass so big-

20:14.554 --> 20:16.995
This is my brother, Derek.

20:17.074 --> 20:19.434
My bad, y'all have already met.

20:19.474 --> 20:22.475
- Yeah, we're acquainted.
- Hi.

20:22.554 --> 20:25.355
- Hi.
- Oh, hell, no!

20:25.395 --> 20:29.356
You're not going to introduce me?
Forget my name, your manners?

20:29.436 --> 20:31.276
You don't need
to know him.

20:31.356 --> 20:34.636
Excuse me, you do need to know me.
Everybody needs to know me.

20:34.716 --> 20:38.957
They call me Snook-G, from the CG.
And don't you forget it.

20:39.036 --> 20:41.637
They call him Snookie,
because "fool" was taken.

20:41.677 --> 20:45.637
They call me Snook,
the cootchie crook.

20:45.677 --> 20:49.477
Chi-town, where ya at, girl?
What's your first class?

20:51.038 --> 20:53.519
Okay, let's see that
upper body.

20:53.598 --> 20:55.758
Both legs, nice.

20:55.839 --> 20:58.438
- Let's- The upper body.
- I can't. I know.

20:58.478 --> 21:00.838
- I don't have an upper body.
- We go through this every day.

21:00.879 --> 21:03.879
You need to work your upper body.
Go do some chin-ups.

21:03.919 --> 21:08.040
Stacia, you're next. Kathy,
spot her. Good. Point your toes.

21:08.079 --> 21:10.080
That's it.

21:13.680 --> 21:16.640
All right, Sara.
You're up.

21:16.720 --> 21:18.640
I hate this class!

21:18.721 --> 21:20.601
- Look at my hand!
- Girl, you are bleeding.

21:20.681 --> 21:24.121
I hate her. She made me climb up to
the very- well, not the very top.

21:24.201 --> 21:27.802
Obviously.

21:34.643 --> 21:36.402
Damn.

21:50.444 --> 21:54.124
Ex-cuuse me!

21:54.165 --> 21:56.885
Last time you said
you would and you didn't.

21:56.965 --> 21:59.926
Wait. Hold on, hold on.

22:00.005 --> 22:02.205
Sara.

22:02.284 --> 22:04.845
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

22:04.925 --> 22:07.085
How you get your leg
to twist like that?

22:07.126 --> 22:10.326
What's up with that double-jointed,
cheerleader shit anyway?

22:10.406 --> 22:14.686
Nothing's up with it. I just
used to dance. Ballet, mostly.

22:14.766 --> 22:18.606
Oh. So you should hit Stepps
with us tomorrow night.

22:18.647 --> 22:21.848
It's a club. You know,
like mostly hip-hop.

22:21.887 --> 22:25.408
It's sort of members only,
you know what I'm saying?

22:25.488 --> 22:28.047
Oh. I don't know.

22:28.087 --> 22:31.207
- You should go.
- Yeah, Snook spins sometimes,

22:31.288 --> 22:34.688
- so he might be able to get you in.
- Who?

22:34.769 --> 22:38.769
Snook, she needs to get hooked up
with Stepps, all the way hooked up.

22:38.850 --> 22:41.049
- All right. Give him a twenty.
- For what?

22:41.129 --> 22:42.969
I.D.

22:43.049 --> 22:45.369
She thought she was
getting in off your looks.

22:45.410 --> 22:47.850
Ha! No, no.

22:49.530 --> 22:52.850
Your girl is weak, all right?
I got my rep to watch.

22:52.889 --> 22:56.210
I can't be getting any old
toe-tapping, ass-shaking bandstand-

22:56.291 --> 22:59.971
Snookie, you talk a lot of shit
for someone who never says anything.

23:00.051 --> 23:03.772
- Oh!

23:05.292 --> 23:07.291
You gonna pay the man,
or what?

23:12.412 --> 23:14.613
- I don't know where it is.
- I'll give you my address.

23:14.653 --> 23:16.933
We'll meet up,
and we'll go together.

23:17.014 --> 23:19.772
And I will have your I.D.

23:19.813 --> 23:22.214
Stepps ain't no square dance.

23:22.293 --> 23:24.374
That's all right. I dance
in circles, probably around you.

23:27.575 --> 23:30.135
- This girl's a joke, man.
- What? Break out.

23:30.175 --> 23:34.734
Don't you got something to do?
Money to spend? All right.

23:37.255 --> 23:39.496
Let's roll, girl.

23:46.815 --> 23:48.696
Mm-mm-mmm!

24:03.417 --> 24:06.498
Hey, girl.
Come in.

24:06.539 --> 24:09.458
- So you found the place okay?
- Yeah, it was fine.

24:09.538 --> 24:12.378
All right, I'm just gonna get
my coat and then we'll be out.

24:23.339 --> 24:26.700
Cool outfit.

24:26.780 --> 24:29.340
Slammin'.
Slammin' outfit.

24:29.380 --> 24:31.621
Oh.

24:31.660 --> 24:34.341
Momma Dean?
I'm leaving.

24:34.421 --> 24:37.140
I-I look okay, right?

24:38.701 --> 24:41.062
Uh, yeah.

24:41.102 --> 24:43.302
You look all right.

24:43.382 --> 24:47.263
Momma Dean, Sara.
Sara, Mom, aka Momma Dean.

24:47.343 --> 24:49.422
Hi, sweetheart.
How are you?

24:49.502 --> 24:52.942
And handsome here
is Christopher.

24:53.023 --> 24:55.703
Now don't get him
all riled up, Chenille.

24:55.784 --> 24:59.424
I'm gonna get me
some sleep tonight.

24:59.464 --> 25:02.023
- Glad to have met you.
- Bye.

25:04.944 --> 25:07.584
I'll be home at 1:00
at the latest.

25:09.544 --> 25:12.545
Is that- Is he yours?

25:12.585 --> 25:14.785
He sure ain't
Momma Dean's.

25:21.426 --> 25:24.547
- Here is your I.D.
- Thank you.

25:25.667 --> 25:28.906
Chenille!
She's ugly! She's fat.

25:28.946 --> 25:33.427
She's 21. Come on, girl,
let's roll. I ain't got all night.

25:33.507 --> 25:36.547
Wait, wait, I just have to ask you
a question. Do I really look okay?

25:39.427 --> 25:41.507
Yo, Lakisha,
let me use your car.

25:41.548 --> 25:43.428
I just want to sit
in it for a minute.

25:43.468 --> 25:45.989
- All right?
- All right.

25:46.028 --> 25:47.909
- Come on.
- What? I-I thought-

25:47.948 --> 25:52.389
- Get in. Let's go, let's go.
- Okay.

25:52.468 --> 25:56.389
All right, you need to take off
that fifth-grade, dance-looking top.

25:56.509 --> 25:59.069
- It's from the Gap.
- It's country,

25:59.150 --> 26:01.030
and you look country in it.

26:01.070 --> 26:02.950
Let's go.

26:02.991 --> 26:06.110
You're going to
put these on too.

26:06.190 --> 26:08.191
What the hell am I
going to do with this?

26:10.991 --> 26:12.911
Oh. Come here, come here,
come here.

26:17.871 --> 26:19.751
- Thanks, girl.
- No problem.

26:22.112 --> 26:23.952
Let's bounce.

26:26.352 --> 26:29.874
-Yo, you got a pocket for this cash?
-Yeah.

26:44.714 --> 26:48.115
Let's get to our table before
it gets crashed and I hurt somebody.

26:48.195 --> 26:50.315
What are you,
some kind of V.I.P.?

26:50.395 --> 26:52.356
No, Snook hooks me up
when he spins.

27:03.877 --> 27:07.557
Uh-huh.
Damn!

27:07.637 --> 27:11.476
- Hey, hey. You got it. Got it.
- Got what?

27:11.557 --> 27:15.278
What? The right to walk past
your greasy, tickle-dick self...

27:15.357 --> 27:17.478
- without your paws on my ass?
- Yeah. You got it.

27:17.558 --> 27:20.079
That's how I got it?

27:20.158 --> 27:23.878
That's how I thought
I had it. Come on, girl.

27:54.161 --> 27:57.882
- Hey, what's up?
- We're in here.

27:57.962 --> 28:01.282
Shawna! Sara, Shawna.
Shawna, Sara.

28:01.362 --> 28:04.643
Hi, love.
So, this place is tight, right?

28:04.722 --> 28:08.483
- It's so cool.
- What is up with this place?

28:08.563 --> 28:10.844
Seems like they're letting
anybody in.

28:10.924 --> 28:13.563
And they started
with you.

28:14.843 --> 28:17.964
I'm Nikki.
Alyssa, Jasmin.

28:18.044 --> 28:20.404
You know Diggy, right,
Marcia?

28:20.484 --> 28:23.405
Sara.
It's Sara, actually.

28:23.484 --> 28:25.645
I know you, though.
You're in my gym class, right?

28:25.724 --> 28:29.045
- That don't mean you know me.
- Quit it, Nikki.

28:29.125 --> 28:31.725
Quit what?
I ain't walking on eggshells...

28:31.806 --> 28:34.646
just 'cause you brought
the Brady Bunch to the Negro club.

28:34.725 --> 28:36.566
Maybe you came to
the wrong spot,

28:36.646 --> 28:38.526
'cause I'm pretty sure
there aren't any Negroes here.

28:39.646 --> 28:42.326
Doh!

28:42.406 --> 28:44.567
I'm pretty sure
you came with one.

28:44.647 --> 28:48.167
Oh, no, wench.
You did not just call me a Negro!

28:48.247 --> 28:51.447
- Y'all just chill, okay.
- Why don't you tell her to chill?

28:51.527 --> 28:53.567
She the one that's
always got something to say.

28:53.648 --> 28:57.168
I could say a lot more.
You keep talking, Nikki,

28:57.208 --> 29:00.089
I will lay
all your shit bare.

29:10.409 --> 29:13.930
Dang. Why you gotta
burn her like that, Chenille?

29:14.010 --> 29:17.770
'Cause I can't stand her ass
and the way she played my brother.

29:31.731 --> 29:33.812
Hey.

29:37.412 --> 29:39.853
- Hi, what's up, D.!
- Hey, man.

29:46.173 --> 29:49.334
- Let's dance.
- Let's not.

29:50.613 --> 29:53.414
Oh, it's gonna be
like that?

29:53.494 --> 29:55.253
Well, how'd you think
it was gonna be?

29:55.334 --> 29:58.334
You was going to drop me and pick
me up whenever you felt like it?

29:58.414 --> 30:00.535
I miss you.

30:00.614 --> 30:03.855
Does this have to do with that fool
from Northwestern dismissing you?

30:03.935 --> 30:08.175
Ain't nobody dissed or dismissed me,
Derek. I laid him off.

30:08.255 --> 30:12.295
Fired me?
You laid him off?

30:12.376 --> 30:15.136
All you gotta do is find somebody
to dance with and it'll be good.

30:21.256 --> 30:25.057
- What's up? What did he say?
- He's trippin', come on.

30:26.098 --> 30:28.617
Yo!
Excuse me!

30:28.698 --> 30:31.018
- Wanna dance with me for a minute?
- Yeah.

30:31.098 --> 30:32.939
- Catch you later, all right?
- All right.

30:33.018 --> 30:35.818
What you drinking?

30:35.898 --> 30:39.458
- I don't know. I'll have, um-
- That's him coming over.

30:39.539 --> 30:42.139
- Who?
- Christopher's father.

30:42.219 --> 30:45.940
Don't look, don't look.
Don't.

30:54.460 --> 30:57.501
How you doing?

30:57.581 --> 31:00.020
Why don't you ask
how your son is doing?

31:00.101 --> 31:02.501
That's a line
you ain't tried in awhile.

31:02.581 --> 31:05.462
Now why you got to
jump off like that?

31:05.541 --> 31:07.382
Why you gotta be
like you are?

31:07.462 --> 31:10.263
I thought you was coming
to get Christopher on Sunday.

31:10.342 --> 31:12.942
What happened?
You got amnesia?

31:13.022 --> 31:14.862
Look, I'll take him
next week.

31:14.942 --> 31:17.103
I had to work
on Sunday.

31:17.182 --> 31:19.303
I ain't seen
the fruits of that labor.

31:19.383 --> 31:21.223
Come on, Chenille.

31:21.303 --> 31:23.424
Chenille.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.983
I mean, you know
you want to dance with me.

31:28.064 --> 31:30.144
That's why you came here-

31:30.224 --> 31:32.944
to yell at me
and to dance with me.

31:39.585 --> 31:42.265
Kenny, Sara.
Sara, Kenny.

31:42.345 --> 31:44.865
- Hi.
- Hey, what's up?

31:48.186 --> 31:50.106
Rum and coke.
No ice.

31:54.426 --> 31:56.266
Hey!

32:04.307 --> 32:06.427
I know this little girl
her name is Maxine

32:06.508 --> 32:09.228
Her beauty is like
a bunch of rose

32:09.308 --> 32:12.669
If lever tell you 'bout Maxine
You only say I don't know

32:12.748 --> 32:16.508
-What I know, but murder she wrote
-Forreal, forreal

32:16.588 --> 32:24.190
Murder she wrote, Murder she wrote
Murder she wrote

32:24.269 --> 32:26.551
Watch ya now it name a pretty face
and bad character

32:42.871 --> 32:47.151
Rum and coke, straight up,
and a beer... anything.

32:47.192 --> 32:50.113
That's a bad choice,
"anything."

32:50.192 --> 32:52.072
It's just a beer.

32:52.113 --> 32:54.472
Well, it should be
the best beer.

32:54.512 --> 32:57.233
But you'd know that
if you even drank.

32:57.312 --> 32:59.233
Whatever.

32:59.313 --> 33:02.314
What's that mean?
"Whatever"?

33:02.393 --> 33:05.714
Whatever you want it to mean.
You're the genius, right?

33:05.754 --> 33:07.834
- You know everything.
- Not everything.

33:07.914 --> 33:10.154
Like I don't know why
we're still standing here.

33:10.234 --> 33:13.074
I'm supposed to be
dizzy by now, remember?

33:13.155 --> 33:15.595
From all those circles
you danced around me.

33:15.675 --> 33:18.636
I don't feel like
dancing right now.

33:18.715 --> 33:21.995
- But you know how?
- Would I be here, if I didn't?

33:22.075 --> 33:24.556
Let's do it then.
Come on.

33:28.036 --> 33:30.636
Come on.

34:34.003 --> 34:36.882
Cross, front.
Cross, front.

34:36.963 --> 34:39.324
That's it.
That's it. You got it.

34:39.402 --> 34:41.563
Cross, front.
Cross, front-

34:41.643 --> 34:44.004
- Oh, shit!
- Sorry. Sorry.

34:44.083 --> 34:45.804
Sorry, I'm sorry.
Sorry.

34:54.804 --> 34:57.566
Damn, Nikki.
She all up in your nut.

34:57.645 --> 35:00.406
Uh-huh, up in your nut
and cracking it.

35:00.446 --> 35:03.046
What she doing?
Two-stepping?

35:05.646 --> 35:08.807
I don't care what she's doing.
That bitch ain't got shit on me.

35:37.890 --> 35:39.970
He's right there.

36:06.812 --> 36:09.453
Don't be dealing
in here.

36:09.533 --> 36:11.373
What the hell
is wrong with you?

36:33.895 --> 36:37.376
I tell you, don't sell in here!
Malakai, you hear me, man.

36:37.416 --> 36:40.416
Y'all think
it's a game, man?

36:43.977 --> 36:45.976
Kai!

36:46.056 --> 36:49.417
- Get up! Get up!
- All right, it's over. Chill.

36:54.778 --> 36:58.497
- Get off!
- I'm all right.

36:58.538 --> 37:00.458
Move, move.
Keep going.

37:05.699 --> 37:08.059
Go, go, go, go, go.

37:21.900 --> 37:25.100
I gotta find my brother.
Derek! Derek!

37:25.181 --> 37:28.220
It's about to get real out here,
y'all. Cops and shit, I'm gone.

37:28.301 --> 37:30.341
All right, girl.
Derek!

37:31.742 --> 37:35.142
Derek!
Yo, what the-

37:35.222 --> 37:38.422
- Go.
- Come on, man, get in. Let's go.

37:38.501 --> 37:40.902
Are you crazy?
What's wrong with you, Derek?

37:46.383 --> 37:48.744
Look, I'm going to tell you
like I've been telling you,

37:48.822 --> 37:52.823
you need to leave Malakai alone and
let that scrub handle his own mess.

37:52.903 --> 37:55.464
Chenille, scramble the CD. I ain't
trying to hear all that shit.

37:55.544 --> 37:58.144
You guys, I live like five blocks
that way. I'm just going to go home.

37:58.225 --> 38:01.385
-I'll see you later.
-No, not alone in this neighborhood.

38:01.425 --> 38:03.824
There's too many little boys
out here thinking they thugs.

38:03.865 --> 38:06.064
- I'll walk you.
- No, don't worry about me.

38:06.145 --> 38:08.625
- It's no problem.
- No, I said I'll walk you.

38:08.705 --> 38:13.266
- Well, what about you?
- We live right around the corner.

38:13.346 --> 38:15.465
- Well, I'll be home in a minute.
- All right.

38:15.506 --> 38:18.266
So you was working it
tonight, girl.

38:18.346 --> 38:21.706
- Yeah, right, slammin'.
- Later.

38:21.787 --> 38:23.626
Bye.

38:23.707 --> 38:25.707
Come on, Braveheart.

38:29.667 --> 38:31.507
Maybe you want to
hook up sometime?

38:31.587 --> 38:34.868
You know, after school?
Work on your moves, if you want.

38:34.948 --> 38:37.388
Yeah, sure,
if you want.

38:37.469 --> 38:42.348
So how'd you like Stepps,
once you got used to the music?

38:42.428 --> 38:44.669
It wasn't the music that I
had to get used to, Derek.

38:44.748 --> 38:47.309
That's not the first time
I've heard hip-hop.

38:47.350 --> 38:51.790
Uh-huh. I bet you listen to it
all the time.

38:55.110 --> 38:56.950
So are we getting any closer
to your crib,

38:57.030 --> 39:00.231
or are we going to have to
stop for food and water?

39:00.310 --> 39:02.671
- We- We passed it.
- You passed it.

39:09.591 --> 39:12.672
- Thank you for walking me home.
- Was that thanks like,

39:12.751 --> 39:14.952
"Gee whiz, I had a great time,"
or was that thanks like,

39:15.032 --> 39:18.193
"I'll bust a cap in your ass, if you
ever darken my doorstep again"?

39:18.232 --> 39:22.593
No, I would never
bust a cap in your ass.

39:24.473 --> 39:26.834
Oh.

39:26.913 --> 39:29.874
Just checking.

39:29.954 --> 39:32.513
So, uh, you're here.
you're home.

39:32.594 --> 39:35.594
I'll see ya.

39:35.674 --> 39:37.395
See ya at school.

39:37.474 --> 39:39.835
Okay.

39:39.875 --> 39:42.476
See ya.

39:42.555 --> 39:44.474
Thank you for the dance.

40:04.357 --> 40:07.278
- Morning.
- You scared me.

40:07.357 --> 40:10.517
I didn't know that you were home.
I didn't see your car outside.

40:10.598 --> 40:12.638
Yeah, the night's
full of surprises.

40:12.677 --> 40:15.998
I had a big one myself
when I came home on my break.

40:16.038 --> 40:20.119
- Where were you, Sara?
- I was just out with some friends.

40:20.199 --> 40:23.479
And I just missed some work. Half
a night's worth. Hope you had fun.

40:23.558 --> 40:25.839
I did.
I had a great time.

40:25.919 --> 40:28.440
Yeah, look,

40:28.520 --> 40:32.040
you're 17 years old,
if you wanna go out, go out.

40:32.080 --> 40:33.960
But don't sneak around.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.200
And on top of everything else,
don't make me worry about you.

40:37.280 --> 40:39.281
Oh, now you're worried
about me?

40:39.361 --> 40:41.801
Now that I'm old enough to take care
of myself? Perfect timing, Roy.

40:41.881 --> 40:44.521
You know, the rules about going out
are very simple, Sara.

40:44.602 --> 40:48.241
I wanna know where and when. And
I want you home at a decent hour.

40:48.321 --> 40:52.722
- End of discussion.
- Fine, end of discussion. Relax.

40:57.763 --> 41:01.363
All right, lesson one. See, hip-hop
is more than just like a dance,

41:01.443 --> 41:03.323
it's more like-
Like an attitude, you know.

41:03.403 --> 41:07.003
You gotta loosen up so you can feel
them and let them flow through you.

41:07.084 --> 41:09.444
-All right, so just stay right here.

41:09.524 --> 41:11.964
Now, what is this?
Bring your feet out like this.

41:12.045 --> 41:14.524
Put your feet forward.
Right, spread 'em, spread 'em.

41:14.604 --> 41:16.764
- You all right, then?
- Yes.

41:16.845 --> 41:20.445
Just hang loose.
Be strong, a tree, right?

41:20.525 --> 41:24.565
Left, right, left, right,
left, right, left, right.

41:30.605 --> 41:34.567
- Make that sound with me. Uhhh!
- Uhhh!

41:35.887 --> 41:39.526
What, are you sitting down
for tea or something?

41:39.566 --> 41:41.487
Get up.

41:42.927 --> 41:46.328
Boom. That's it.
Just chillin'.

41:49.288 --> 41:51.129
You just do it.
Sit down.

41:51.208 --> 41:53.728
Okay.

41:58.448 --> 42:02.329
Now we're just going to walk. It's
real simple. Just walk like this.

42:06.289 --> 42:08.530
- Okay, now you try, you try.
- Okay.

42:08.609 --> 42:10.530
Now just relax,
let it be natural.

42:13.611 --> 42:17.051
Five, six, seven, eight.

42:20.171 --> 42:22.771
Dig into it more, the balls of
your feet instead of your toes.

42:26.012 --> 42:29.452
Bend your knees, bend your knees.
Just slouch a little bit, slouch.

42:29.492 --> 42:31.292
Act like you're
a nasty bitch.

42:32.932 --> 42:36.013
All right, now watch.
Check it, check it, check it.

42:36.052 --> 42:39.533
- Got that?
- Oh, it's come to head bobs?

42:39.613 --> 42:41.774
Okay, it's the same beat,
but then you split it up.

42:41.813 --> 42:45.614
Freeze, freeze, freeze.

42:45.653 --> 42:48.494
- Bounce, bounce.
- I am such a dork.

42:48.534 --> 42:51.014
No, you're not.
Bounce.

42:51.095 --> 42:54.095
- Now I'm cool.
- You're almost there.

42:55.496 --> 42:57.415
Yeah, you got that.

42:59.495 --> 43:01.335
Are you sure it's okay
that we came here?

43:01.415 --> 43:03.976
Well, it is now, but if we're
going to keep on doing this,

43:04.056 --> 43:05.936
we're gonna have to find
someplace else to practice.

43:09.536 --> 43:11.576
Did you always
want to be a doctor?

43:11.656 --> 43:13.776
Who said I wanna be
a doctor?

43:13.817 --> 43:16.657
Chenille. Everybody.

43:17.978 --> 43:20.658
Well, yeah, you know.
I wanna be a doctor,

43:20.698 --> 43:22.938
but I gotta
get into college first.

43:23.017 --> 43:25.977
What kind of doctor?

43:26.058 --> 43:28.298
Pediatrician.
I like kids.

43:30.419 --> 43:34.979
- Do you have any?
- No. Do you?

43:35.058 --> 43:37.939
Oh, I didn't-
I wasn't trying to be smart, Derek.

43:39.419 --> 43:41.300
Wouldn't be the first time.

43:41.339 --> 43:43.740
Screw you,
I'm brilliant and cool.

43:43.820 --> 43:47.100
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

43:54.781 --> 43:57.101
Wow.

44:10.623 --> 44:13.342
That was cute, that little thing
you did. Can you show me again?

44:13.422 --> 44:17.664
- What was that shit you just did?
- Rond dejambe attitude.

44:17.703 --> 44:21.704
- Ballet. I used to dance.
- You used to dance?

44:21.784 --> 44:24.584
Used to, as in don't anymore and no,
I don't want to talk about it.

44:24.665 --> 44:27.984
So, is that why you brought up that
rond dejambe attitude shit...

44:28.064 --> 44:30.145
because you don't want
to talk about it?

44:30.224 --> 44:32.145
It's really not
a big deal.

44:33.945 --> 44:35.785
I think it is.

44:37.746 --> 44:42.426
This club was so slamming, Lindsay,
the dancing. I'm gonna go again.

44:42.466 --> 44:45.466
You are? Well, have you
seen anybody get shot yet?

44:45.507 --> 44:48.107
What? No, I didn't see
anyone get shot yet.

44:48.187 --> 44:50.027
God, I didn't move to Bosnia.

44:50.107 --> 44:51.947
Well, I'm still going to
pray for you.

44:52.026 --> 44:55.307
Jesus, Sara, you're in the freaking
ghetto. Forget about the drive-bys,

44:55.387 --> 44:58.108
how are you supposed to
meet anybody?

44:58.147 --> 45:03.668
Um, well, I did actually
meet somebody, I think.

45:03.749 --> 45:06.228
I met this guy,
and he's really cool.

45:06.308 --> 45:10.228
-They got white guys at your school?
-Um...

45:10.309 --> 45:13.189
no, actually they don't.

45:15.670 --> 45:18.109
Shut up! Look at me.
I want my money.

45:18.149 --> 45:20.070
I don't have it.

45:20.109 --> 45:22.830
Shut up!
Quit your crying, man.

45:22.910 --> 45:24.751
I don't get paid till next week.

45:24.830 --> 45:26.671
You wasn't saying that
when you was smoking it.

45:26.751 --> 45:28.871
-I don't have it!
-Well, you better find it somewhere.

45:28.991 --> 45:31.551
- This ain't no layaway plan.
- Hey! Hey, stop it!

45:31.630 --> 45:35.271
Come here. Where do you
think you're going, huh?

45:35.312 --> 45:37.432
Aahh!
Bitch!

45:41.873 --> 45:46.752
You ain't seen nothing,
so don't say nothing... to nobody.

46:04.434 --> 46:06.315
I stole a bike here once.

46:06.355 --> 46:08.794
- Why'd you do that?
- 'Cause I didn't have one.

46:08.874 --> 46:12.395
- Oh, okay. Good reason.
- Well, it's not a reason, you know,

46:12.475 --> 46:15.316
I used to do shit like that,
you know- wild shit.

46:15.395 --> 46:17.716
- With Malakai?
- Yeah.

46:17.796 --> 46:20.196
I don't get you two.
You seem so different.

46:22.276 --> 46:25.036
- We're not.
- I think you are.

46:25.077 --> 46:27.757
I mean, come on,
Malakai's scary. Very scary.

46:27.837 --> 46:32.117
What you mean by scary?
Kai's tough, he has to be.

46:32.157 --> 46:36.797
But he's still got
a good heart. I know.

46:36.878 --> 46:38.717
Maybe you only think
you know.

46:38.798 --> 46:41.679
Look, Malakai may not be the boy
next door, but he's still my boy.

46:41.758 --> 46:43.798
He does some shit that I'm not
down with sometimes,

46:43.879 --> 46:48.718
but I ain't never going to cross
him off and be like everybody else.

46:48.799 --> 46:51.759
So, you're not down with the stuff
he does, but you are down with him?

46:51.799 --> 46:55.280
- That makes sense. I understand.
- He's my friend, Sara.

46:55.320 --> 46:57.840
You don't have to
understand.

46:57.920 --> 47:01.840
Listen, me and him got into some
shit awhile back- some bad shit.

47:01.920 --> 47:04.721
Broke into a liquor store
and cracked open the cash register.

47:04.800 --> 47:06.641
Somebody peeped us
and called five-0,

47:06.721 --> 47:08.921
and we barely
made it out of the store.

47:08.961 --> 47:12.440
The cops were on our asses. We split
up and ran in different directions.

47:12.521 --> 47:14.401
Now, I must have been going
in the wrong direction,

47:14.441 --> 47:16.321
because the cops
were closing in on me.

47:16.362 --> 47:19.522
So, Malakai, he smashed in some
car windows, set off the alarms...

47:19.563 --> 47:22.003
and turned the heat
from me to him.

47:22.082 --> 47:24.443
I kept running,
and he got caught.

47:24.523 --> 47:27.483
The DA offered him everything but
a Rolls Royce to turn my name in.

47:27.523 --> 47:30.243
But he didn't,
and he never will.

47:42.244 --> 47:44.765
I stole a hat once,
when I was 12.

47:44.845 --> 47:47.686
But my Mom found it
and made me give it back.

47:47.765 --> 47:51.725
Gangsta Sara stole a hat.
Call the F.B.I.

47:51.806 --> 47:53.726
Are you gonna
turn me in?

47:53.765 --> 47:57.486
I think I'll wait
for you to surrender.

47:57.567 --> 48:00.726
So, you get along
with your mom?

48:00.807 --> 48:02.967
You know, you all
tight and shit?

48:03.047 --> 48:07.046
Yeah. We got along,
tight and shit.

48:07.127 --> 48:10.087
-How come you never talk about her?
-'Cause there's nothing to say.

48:10.168 --> 48:12.328
It's because you don't
talk about her.

48:12.368 --> 48:14.528
What do you want
me to do?

48:14.569 --> 48:16.448
I don't know,
just say something about her.

48:16.488 --> 48:19.608
I mean, you don't
say anything about her.

48:19.688 --> 48:22.209
Well, she's dead. God,
what do you want me to do,

48:22.288 --> 48:25.129
-run through the streets screaming?
-If it helps.

48:25.169 --> 48:27.369
Well, it won't,
so drop it.

48:28.890 --> 48:31.049
Didn't mean to press you
about your mom.

48:31.129 --> 48:32.569
It's all right.
Don't worry about it.

48:32.650 --> 48:36.330
Get along with your dad?
Y'all tight and shit?

48:36.370 --> 48:39.051
Yeah, we're both tight
and shit. Our DNA matches.

48:55.932 --> 48:58.452
- What is this place?
- Well, in a few months,

48:58.532 --> 49:01.013
it'll be Club Med
for the homeless, but right now...

49:01.092 --> 49:04.094
just an old furniture spot
I used to work at last summer.

49:04.173 --> 49:09.093
Hop, step, back. Okay?
Real simple, do it with me, right?

49:09.133 --> 49:11.614
- Hop, step, back. Got that?

49:11.693 --> 49:15.854
Try it one more time. Add on the
next part after that, all right?

49:15.895 --> 49:17.655
Six, seven, eight.

49:17.735 --> 49:22.695
Step, back, break, spin,
out, up, step.

49:22.735 --> 49:24.455
Chilly on that?
One more time.

49:24.495 --> 49:26.815
Okay, on this part?
It's like we're battling, right?

49:26.895 --> 49:28.815
It's like a challenge.
When I step forward like this,

49:28.896 --> 49:31.096
you have to challenge me
back into my space,

49:31.176 --> 49:33.095
and I challenge you back
in your space, like this.

49:33.176 --> 49:36.016
So, it's back, front,
back, front,

49:36.096 --> 49:38.257
back, front,
like that, that kinda feel.

49:41.457 --> 49:44.698
Step, back, forth, back.

49:51.977 --> 49:55.818
Wait, wait. You're making
me dizzy. Stop, stop.

49:55.858 --> 49:58.738
Sit on it, sit on it.
Stick your ass out.

49:58.818 --> 50:00.938
- Do it.

50:13.300 --> 50:17.420
Okay, okay. How am I doing?
How's my butt?

50:17.461 --> 50:22.101
It's nice. I mean, it's good.

50:22.142 --> 50:23.862
Thank you.

50:30.582 --> 50:32.582
You made that? It’s really nice.

50:32.662 --> 50:34.382
It's Tanisha's.

50:34.423 --> 50:36.863
That girl's gonna pay my way
through design school.

50:39.302 --> 50:41.463
What about your mom?

50:41.543 --> 50:43.903
Where is she?

50:43.983 --> 50:47.624
She was in jail...
for drugs.

50:47.704 --> 50:51.024
For things women do
for drugs.

50:51.064 --> 50:53.664
She got out
and took off.

50:53.744 --> 50:56.945
Well, maybe she'll come back.

50:58.745 --> 51:03.705
That is what Derek used to say
when we were little,

51:03.785 --> 51:05.945
when Momma Dean used to
piss us off.

51:07.786 --> 51:11.546
But he grew up.
He grew out of it.

51:15.227 --> 51:17.106
You like Derek,
don't you?

51:17.147 --> 51:20.147
No. No.

51:24.587 --> 51:26.868
Wooo! Yeah! I got it!

51:26.908 --> 51:30.067
Yo! What's the deal?
What's going on in there?

51:30.108 --> 51:33.028
- Wh-What's going on?

51:33.108 --> 51:35.349
Dr. Reynolds in the house.
You know what I'm saying?

51:35.389 --> 51:37.989
- What? What?
- Check it out. Check it out.

51:38.069 --> 51:42.069
Georgetown! It's Georgetown!

51:50.030 --> 51:51.870
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

51:51.951 --> 51:54.070
- Really exciting.
- Thank you.

51:54.110 --> 51:58.711
Whoo! Gimme some love.
Give it up.

51:58.751 --> 52:00.791
Are you going to
tell me where we're going?

52:00.831 --> 52:03.072
- No.
- Why is this a surprise for me?

52:03.151 --> 52:04.992
You're the one
with something to celebrate.

52:05.072 --> 52:07.872
- We can celebrate together.
- Okay.

52:20.513 --> 52:23.514
We have an audience.

52:25.874 --> 52:28.434
Work with me.

52:29.955 --> 52:34.594
I can tell
I can tell you want it

52:34.674 --> 52:39.515
Do you well
Baby, I know, I know

52:39.555 --> 52:45.235
Girl, I'm so into you
Let's do what you want to do

52:45.315 --> 52:50.957
I can tell
I can tell you want me

52:51.036 --> 52:56.598
So much flavor I can't lie
would be nice

52:56.677 --> 53:00.597
Girl, if you would
spend the night by my side

53:00.677 --> 53:03.038
Oh, my God.

53:04.198 --> 53:06.398
There's more
for you to see

53:06.438 --> 53:11.398
'Cause I want you
like you want me

53:11.478 --> 53:14.478
- Tonight we'll go on and on
- Feeling strong

53:14.559 --> 53:18.639
Let's make love
to the break of dawn

53:19.760 --> 53:21.840
That lady was freaking out.

53:21.920 --> 53:24.479
- I know it.
- She was really losing it.

53:27.360 --> 53:29.480
- I'm so excited for you.
- Thank you.

53:29.560 --> 53:31.921
- Are you nervous about Georgetown?
- No.

53:32.001 --> 53:34.602
- Yeah.
- Yes.

53:44.562 --> 53:47.443
I'm sorry.
I-I can't go in there.

53:47.522 --> 53:49.802
What do you mean? This is where
I'm taking you, the ballet.

53:49.882 --> 53:51.723
I know, but-

53:51.802 --> 53:53.803
But what?

53:58.724 --> 54:01.124
Nothing.

54:01.164 --> 54:04.243
- Nothing. Never mind.
- Come on.

55:51.655 --> 55:54.135
I thought
you would like it.

55:54.216 --> 55:56.976
- I did.
- You ain't acting like it.

55:57.975 --> 55:59.856
I'm sorry.

55:59.895 --> 56:03.096
I don't want you to think that I
didn't have a good time. I did.

56:03.176 --> 56:05.376
It's just...

56:05.457 --> 56:08.297
ballet is not a part
of my life anymore.

56:08.378 --> 56:11.057
I don't understand.
What happened?

56:11.136 --> 56:14.418
You just woke up one morning
and decided to waste your talent?

56:14.497 --> 56:18.058
How do you know I have talent?
'Cause you saw me do some leg trick?

56:18.098 --> 56:20.299
I saw the look on your face
when you did it.

56:20.338 --> 56:22.219
The same
as I saw tonight-

56:22.258 --> 56:24.458
goofy, happy.

56:24.498 --> 56:26.979
So, if you're gonna tell me
something about not dancing,

56:27.058 --> 56:29.539
at least tell me
something real.

56:29.619 --> 56:31.739
Well, what if
I don't want it to be real?

56:33.860 --> 56:36.740
What I want is to wake up
and see my mom again;

56:36.819 --> 56:39.340
for things to go back to the way
when my life made sense.

56:39.380 --> 56:41.340
But that's not gonna happen,
and it's all my fault.

56:41.421 --> 56:43.221
- All of it.
- What's your fault?

56:43.260 --> 56:46.821
My mom, the accident,
the fact that she's dead.

56:46.901 --> 56:49.181
She got scraped off
some highway because of me...

56:49.261 --> 56:51.741
because of
my stupid audition.

56:51.821 --> 56:56.502
Because she was rushing because
I made her promise to come.

56:56.542 --> 57:00.503
And when they called my name,
I was mad at her because-

57:00.583 --> 57:03.862
because I needed her
to be there and she wasn't.

57:03.902 --> 57:07.503
She was dying while I was dancing,
and I was mad at her.

57:07.543 --> 57:10.864
And I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

57:10.904 --> 57:13.224
- I'm so sorry.
- Listen.

57:13.304 --> 57:16.063
It is not your fault
that she died...

57:16.144 --> 57:17.984
or that she was rushing.

57:18.064 --> 57:20.624
She cared about you.
She just wanted to be there for you.

57:20.704 --> 57:24.825
That's what makes it so bad. She
always wanted what was right for me.

57:24.905 --> 57:27.345
I wanted to be the prima ballerina.
I had to be.

57:27.385 --> 57:31.265
And I didn't care if it took all of
her money and all of her spare time.

57:31.346 --> 57:36.026
It was my stupid audition and my
stupid dream, and it killed her.

57:36.106 --> 57:39.027
And all she wanted
was for it to come true.

57:39.066 --> 57:40.946
I bet she would still want it
to come true.

57:40.986 --> 57:42.867
She wouldn't want you
to give that up.

57:42.906 --> 57:47.187
I know. I just- I don't think that
I can do it without her.

57:51.708 --> 57:53.547
What do you want?

57:54.908 --> 57:56.748
Do you wanna do it,
Sara?

57:56.828 --> 58:00.228
I mean you.

58:00.309 --> 58:02.149
Do you want Juilliard?

58:04.270 --> 58:07.029
- Yes.
- All right.

58:07.068 --> 58:09.189
Then, it's on you.

58:09.269 --> 58:12.870
You're the one that's gonna
have to make it happen.

58:12.949 --> 58:16.950
You're the one that's gonna have to
make the dream come true.

58:57.154 --> 58:59.035
So, I'll see you tomorrow?

58:59.074 --> 59:01.195
Yeah.

59:01.274 --> 59:04.636
I promise not to have
a nervous breakdown.

59:42.799 --> 59:45.120
Good night.

59:46.280 --> 59:48.119
Good night.

01:01:10.648 --> 01:01:13.529
Top billin' silkin' pure linen
Me and Little Ceas

01:01:13.569 --> 01:01:16.729
Malibusea breeze
Dom P's, palm trees

01:01:16.809 --> 01:01:19.449
Cat's lay Pablo
in milked out Diablo

01:01:19.528 --> 01:01:21.009
The williest
which would be the silliest

01:01:21.089 --> 01:01:23.489
The more I smoke, the smaller
the Philly gets

01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:25.850
I called Juilliard
for an application.

01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:27.890
They're holding auditions
in Chicago next month.

01:01:27.930 --> 01:01:29.810
Next month. That's cool.

01:01:29.851 --> 01:01:31.730
I'm out of shape, and it hurts.

01:01:31.770 --> 01:01:34.370
If that's what you call
out of shape,

01:01:34.451 --> 01:01:36.291
what does it take
to get you in shape?

01:01:36.371 --> 01:01:39.291
- Practice.
- Okay, jog around the room, then.

01:01:39.372 --> 01:01:41.812
Do some push-ups.
I'll sit here, and I'm gonna watch.

01:01:41.852 --> 01:01:43.731
That's not how
I get into shape.

01:01:43.772 --> 01:01:47.572
- Stretch the leg.

01:01:47.652 --> 01:01:50.812
That's it.
Now shoulders down.

01:01:50.852 --> 01:01:53.413
And bring the hip down
as you go.

01:01:53.493 --> 01:01:56.653
And stretch
through the toes.

01:01:56.732 --> 01:01:59.413
Don't wait.

01:02:01.213 --> 01:02:03.813
And finish.

01:02:03.894 --> 01:02:05.734
Good.

01:02:05.814 --> 01:02:08.135
You know,
I'm okay with the ballet part,

01:02:08.214 --> 01:02:10.054
but I need help
with my free form.

01:02:10.134 --> 01:02:12.415
Yeah, hey, Mama

01:02:12.494 --> 01:02:15.295

later we can power drive

01:02:15.375 --> 01:02:17.695
You and your girls
Me and my boys in the impala

01:02:17.735 --> 01:02:19.816
Five on five
Ten dimes just like my dollar be

01:02:19.895 --> 01:02:22.615
Your body so bad

01:02:22.655 --> 01:02:26.216
I'm bad, baby, I ain't lyin '
I'm bad, baby, I ain't lyin'

01:02:26.296 --> 01:02:28.696
I see you shake your thing

01:02:28.777 --> 01:02:31.177
We could take a ride
down the love canal

01:02:31.256 --> 01:02:34.136
And, baby, later on at the crack
of dawn in a Cadillac

01:02:34.216 --> 01:02:37.577

Girl, who is Snookie

01:03:08.501 --> 01:03:10.981
I don't know.
Anything with legs.

01:03:13.581 --> 01:03:16.861
I think someone got spilled on.
Hey, back off.

01:03:16.901 --> 01:03:18.781
Ain't nobody watchin' you
but me.

01:03:18.822 --> 01:03:21.342
Yeah, right,

01:03:21.422 --> 01:03:23.302
Come on. Gotta get ready
for Juilliard.

01:03:23.342 --> 01:03:26.182

Fiending like an athlete

Life ain't a track meet
It's a marathon

01:03:36.744 --> 01:03:40.224
Fuck the cemetery

01:03:40.303 --> 01:03:41.663
We be clubbin' till
the day we die

01:03:41.704 --> 01:03:43.984
You can ask the bartender

01:03:44.064 --> 01:03:46.385
But if you think we high
nigga, think again

01:03:46.464 --> 01:03:48.745
'Cause when it's sink or swim

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:50.984
And if I drink this here

01:03:51.024 --> 01:03:53.424

01:06:30.001 --> 01:06:34.682
Let me know if this right here is
something you can have for years

01:06:34.722 --> 01:06:37.442
Now, Mase, be the man
Wanna see you doing good

01:06:37.521 --> 01:06:39.882
I don't wanna get rich
Leave you in the hood

01:06:39.962 --> 01:06:41.843
Girl, in my eyes
you the baddest

01:06:41.882 --> 01:06:44.362
The reason why I love you
you don't like me cuz my status

01:06:44.443 --> 01:06:47.283
I don't wanna see you with
a carriage livin' average

01:06:47.363 --> 01:06:49.563
I wanna do my thing
so we be established

01:06:49.644 --> 01:06:51.603
And I don't want you
rockin' them fabrics

01:06:51.683 --> 01:06:55.004
Girl, I wanna give you karats
till you feel you a rabbit

01:06:55.083 --> 01:06:57.564
Anything in your path you want
you can have it

01:06:57.645 --> 01:06:59.484
You never look as good
as she does with him.

01:06:59.565 --> 01:07:02.445
That's oil. You're milk.

01:07:02.525 --> 01:07:05.565
Ain't no point
trying to mix.

01:07:05.644 --> 01:07:09.205
Tell me what you want from me
Take a look at what you see

01:07:09.245 --> 01:07:13.766
Let me know if this right here is
something you can have for years

01:07:13.846 --> 01:07:19.526
Tell me what you want for me
Take a look at what you see

01:07:19.606 --> 01:07:23.527
Let me know if this right here is
something you can have for years

01:07:23.607 --> 01:07:26.168
Hey, Mama, won't you
come here to Papa

01:07:26.207 --> 01:07:29.206
You don't like the way
your tata's lookin' at Shada

01:07:29.247 --> 01:07:31.327
In a 600, there ain't
no smokin' cigada

01:07:31.407 --> 01:07:34.728
Come over here, I think
I see your baby faddah

01:07:34.848 --> 01:07:36.329
Here ya go the number
to my casa

01:07:36.408 --> 01:07:39.009
If you in a rush
you call me manana

01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:42.288
Hey, what's up?

01:07:42.328 --> 01:07:44.089
Look, we were just dancing.

01:07:44.168 --> 01:07:46.289
And what, her ass just happened
to fall into your hands?

01:07:46.369 --> 01:07:50.450
No, it was- You were dancing with
Snookie, I was dancing with Nikki.

01:07:50.530 --> 01:07:52.370
The music was going and-

01:07:54.690 --> 01:07:56.530
I thought we were
having a good time.

01:07:56.570 --> 01:07:58.370
Please, girlfriend
don't start nothin'

01:07:58.450 --> 01:08:02.251
Look. There's nothing
between me and Nikki anymore.

01:08:02.331 --> 01:08:04.211
I didn't mean to hurt you.

01:08:04.251 --> 01:08:06.131
And I ain't gonna ask
who smashed the E-Class

01:08:06.212 --> 01:08:10.971
Sara, I would never do
anything to hurt you.

01:08:11.051 --> 01:08:12.892
I'm sorry.

01:08:14.612 --> 01:08:17.893
I really am sorry.

01:08:17.973 --> 01:08:23.011
Let me know if this right here is
something you can have for years

01:08:23.093 --> 01:08:26.412
- You wanna go?
- Yeah.

01:08:26.493 --> 01:08:28.613
Come on. Let's go.

01:08:28.694 --> 01:08:33.214
Let me know if this right here is
something you can have for years

01:08:36.254 --> 01:08:38.175
This is it.
This is where I live.

01:08:38.254 --> 01:08:40.455
This is my dad's music room.

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:42.895
- He plays the trumpet.
- No shit.

01:08:42.935 --> 01:08:46.615
He's actually
pretty good if you like jazz.

01:08:46.654 --> 01:08:48.535
No.

01:08:48.575 --> 01:08:50.656
He's got some nice stereo equipment.
It's off the hook.

01:08:50.736 --> 01:08:52.576
Huh.

01:08:59.816 --> 01:09:01.656
And this is
our living room.

01:09:01.737 --> 01:09:05.296
- It's not anything special.
- It's all right.

01:09:05.337 --> 01:09:09.858
I see your true colors
shining through

01:09:09.938 --> 01:09:12.698
My dad's gonna fix that.
It's kind of messy in there.

01:09:12.738 --> 01:09:15.298
True colors and that's why
I love you

01:09:15.377 --> 01:09:17.218
- Do you wanna see my room?
- Uh, yeah.

01:09:17.298 --> 01:09:20.419
- This is it. I sleep on the couch.

01:09:20.499 --> 01:09:22.779
There's a bed underneath,
but it gets stuck,

01:09:22.819 --> 01:09:26.340
and my dad says he's gonna
fix it, but I don't know.

01:09:26.419 --> 01:09:29.580
He's, um,
at work right now.

01:09:29.658 --> 01:09:32.381
He'll... be gone
all night.

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:39.140
Yeah, um-

01:10:09.864 --> 01:10:13.144
I see your true colors

01:10:13.185 --> 01:10:15.424
- Shining through
- Straight up

01:10:15.504 --> 01:10:19.024
I see your true colors

01:10:19.105 --> 01:10:21.346
That's why I love you

01:10:21.385 --> 01:10:23.906
I see your true colors

01:10:26.626 --> 01:10:30.226
I'd sleep in a dresser too
if I had six brothers to sleep with.

01:10:30.306 --> 01:10:32.146
Hey, fellas, what's up?

01:10:32.226 --> 01:10:34.067
- Look at this stud.
- What's up, man?

01:10:34.146 --> 01:10:35.906
Hey, playah.
How you doin', man?

01:10:35.987 --> 01:10:38.387
Whas sup, baby?

01:10:38.467 --> 01:10:41.666
Oh, no love. No love.

01:10:41.707 --> 01:10:45.387
I hear you been traveling in
new circles. What's up with that?

01:10:45.468 --> 01:10:47.748
- You tappin' that white girl?

01:10:47.828 --> 01:10:51.428
That's why you ain't got more time
for your boys? Too busy fronting?

01:10:51.509 --> 01:10:56.309
Too busy snow flaking. If that's the
case, you best be watching your back.

01:10:56.388 --> 01:10:59.669
'Cause white women
don't bring nothin' but trouble.

01:10:59.749 --> 01:11:01.510
That ain't white women, man.
That's women.

01:11:01.549 --> 01:11:03.790
- That's your women.
- Yo, are we gonna check out...

01:11:03.870 --> 01:11:05.511
some honeys on the west side?

01:11:05.550 --> 01:11:07.830
- You riding?
- Hell, no.

01:11:07.909 --> 01:11:10.950
This ain't about no honeys.
I know what it's about.

01:11:10.990 --> 01:11:15.111
Those fools we stomped at Stepps
hit my corner four strong last week.

01:11:15.191 --> 01:11:17.511
- I gotta handle myself.
- You slide out that side of town,

01:11:17.592 --> 01:11:22.151
- they gonna handle you.
- They can bring it. I got my heat.

01:11:22.231 --> 01:11:24.552
All that gat's gonna do is create
some unnecessary mayhem, man.

01:11:24.591 --> 01:11:26.472
That's the black man's life-

01:11:26.511 --> 01:11:28.592
- madness and mayhem.
- How do you know?

01:11:28.673 --> 01:11:30.833
You just got out of juvee,
and now you're talking about...

01:11:30.912 --> 01:11:32.832
going out there trying to
start some more shit?

01:11:32.912 --> 01:11:36.353
- That shit ain't funny.

01:11:36.433 --> 01:11:39.114
You act like you don't know
who you are anymore, Derek.

01:11:39.193 --> 01:11:42.114
And what's up out there
for anybody who ain't you?

01:11:42.194 --> 01:11:45.353
I'm still from
this neighborhood, but you?

01:11:45.394 --> 01:11:47.954
I guess that's what happens
when a white girl goes to your head.

01:11:48.034 --> 01:11:50.635
- Or gives you some.
- Shut up, Lip.

01:11:50.714 --> 01:11:51.995
Sorry.

01:11:52.074 --> 01:11:55.036
I know what's out there.
Ain't like you can't get past it,

01:11:55.115 --> 01:11:56.956
but you're too busy getting
in your own way to see that.

01:11:57.035 --> 01:11:59.915
I had some help getting
in my own way, didn't I?

01:12:18.358 --> 01:12:20.317
Hey, was sup?

01:12:20.398 --> 01:12:22.838
What the hell was that?

01:12:22.918 --> 01:12:24.758
I was trying to
block the ball.

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.441
Stupid bitch!

01:12:55.521 --> 01:12:58.362
Good going, Sara!

01:13:05.442 --> 01:13:08.602
Get off! That's it!
Nikki, back off!

01:13:11.843 --> 01:13:13.523
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!

01:13:13.604 --> 01:13:15.483
- Yeah, yeah!
- I like that!

01:13:37.125 --> 01:13:39.765
- What is this shit?

01:13:43.446 --> 01:13:46.567
- Malakai? Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah, man.

01:13:48.847 --> 01:13:50.887
Any body catch one?

01:14:03.849 --> 01:14:06.168
It ain't over, bitch.

01:14:06.248 --> 01:14:08.089
I don't even know why
it started, bitch.

01:14:09.689 --> 01:14:11.529
'Cause you always
in my way.

01:14:11.609 --> 01:14:15.210
I'm only in your way when it comes
to Derek. That's what this is about.

01:14:15.330 --> 01:14:19.730
No, it's about you.
White girls like you.

01:14:19.769 --> 01:14:22.770
Creepin' up,
takin' our men.

01:14:22.850 --> 01:14:26.211
The whole world ain't enough,
you got to conquer ours too.

01:14:26.291 --> 01:14:28.891
Whatever, Nikki.
Derek and I like each other,

01:14:28.971 --> 01:14:31.131
and if you have a problem
with that, screw you.

01:14:43.173 --> 01:14:45.052
I'll get it.

01:14:47.333 --> 01:14:50.053
- Yeah, I'm coming.

01:14:52.973 --> 01:14:56.094
- Oh, hi.
- Shit!

01:14:56.134 --> 01:14:58.653
- I'm okay.
- Wait. Let me see.

01:14:58.733 --> 01:15:00.974
I'm really okay.
I'm fine.

01:15:01.054 --> 01:15:02.975
Well,
what did she do?

01:15:04.575 --> 01:15:07.415
Um, now is really not
a good time to talk.

01:15:07.455 --> 01:15:09.854
- Okay. Well-
- I'll call you.

01:15:13.815 --> 01:15:15.655
Oh, no.

01:15:20.497 --> 01:15:22.335
Here, let me see.

01:15:23.536 --> 01:15:25.376
- Here.
- God, that stinks.

01:15:25.457 --> 01:15:28.297
Yeah, but it's gonna keep your face
from swelling up like a pumpkin.

01:15:28.377 --> 01:15:32.538
Hold it. Here.
Hold it on there.

01:15:37.417 --> 01:15:40.738
It was midnight
at the party

01:15:40.778 --> 01:15:43.019
So, whatcha gonna do?

01:15:43.099 --> 01:15:45.979
As you walk in
looking nice

01:15:46.059 --> 01:15:49.259
It's payback time.
Either you down or you not.

01:15:49.339 --> 01:15:51.459
Either you my boy or you ain't.
Simple as that.

01:15:51.539 --> 01:15:55.620
Oh, ha! Hey, baby,
we lit it up out there.

01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:57.540
I am serious.
Did you see us, "D" man?

01:15:57.620 --> 01:16:00.381
Do you see us?
We're talking.

01:16:00.421 --> 01:16:04.060
Anyway. Hey, baby,
we lit it up.

01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:07.981
- Oh, man, come on, man!
- That shit ain't funny, man.

01:16:08.061 --> 01:16:11.461
- You damn right it ain't funny.
- It hought you liked it down there.

01:16:11.542 --> 01:16:14.461
That's your specialty, ain't it?
Crawling on the floor like a bitch.

01:16:14.541 --> 01:16:16.941
That was a reflex action
in the heat of the moment.

01:16:17.022 --> 01:16:20.743
You're just plain rude and wrong to
bring that shit up in mixed company.

01:16:20.782 --> 01:16:23.663
- I'm gonna go home. Are you ready?
- No, he's not ready.

01:16:23.743 --> 01:16:26.542
He's talking to me.
It's an "A" and "B" conversation.

01:16:26.623 --> 01:16:29.223
- You gotta go? See yourself home.
- Fuck you!

01:16:29.303 --> 01:16:31.984
- Bitch, I'm gonna-
- What the hell is your problem?

01:16:32.063 --> 01:16:35.944
You seem to lie about all
the things you're gonna do

01:16:36.024 --> 01:16:39.264
You gonna take that bitch's back
and won't even cover mine?

01:16:39.303 --> 01:16:42.304
- 'Cause you wrong, Malakai.
- No, you're wrong.

01:16:42.384 --> 01:16:46.185
You been wrong.
You ain't even worth shit no more.

01:16:46.265 --> 01:16:49.826
Get outta my face, college boy, and
take that trailer trash ho with you.

01:16:49.865 --> 01:16:53.065
Little shorts like rubber
Heads bounce like fubber

01:16:53.145 --> 01:16:56.226
See your mind's in the gutter
Wanna bag another lover

01:16:56.266 --> 01:16:58.546
No way, now that I'm blowin '
the spots, you're afer me like

01:16:58.626 --> 01:17:00.067
"Hey, Kool-Aid'"

01:17:00.107 --> 01:17:02.627
All you get is shade, You think
I'm gonna back up the Brinks

01:17:02.667 --> 01:17:05.187
From the Miller's
Gold blatt' sand chinchillas

01:17:05.226 --> 01:17:08.547
End of conversation, Move around
'cause some shortys wanna get down

01:17:08.628 --> 01:17:13.068
I ain't got no time
for no sillyho

01:17:13.148 --> 01:17:17.827
There was the blow of Arsenio
and be all up in my video

01:17:17.868 --> 01:17:20.228
You're not lying
about what you're doing

01:17:20.269 --> 01:17:23.829
I'll trade that ass like Patrick
Ewing, so you better come at me

01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:27.110
Honey, his blue pajamas
are at the bottom of the bag.

01:17:27.189 --> 01:17:30.070
If it's as cold as it was today,
put those on him.

01:17:30.150 --> 01:17:32.870
Hey, whatcha all doing with
my nephew here? Come on now.

01:17:32.910 --> 01:17:36.350
There we go.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:39.191
- What's wrong with him?
- He don't know you, Kenny.

01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:43.950
I'm his father, he knows me.
What should I do?

01:17:43.991 --> 01:17:46.471
- Come around more often.
- See, I can't talk to you.

01:17:46.511 --> 01:17:49.271
And I can't depend on you.

01:17:49.352 --> 01:17:51.512
- Shh.

01:17:51.592 --> 01:17:55.793
What do you think I use
to raise this baby, oxygen?

01:17:55.872 --> 01:17:59.633
He has needs, Kenny,
and his needs require money.

01:17:59.712 --> 01:18:02.713
- Here we go.
- And we're gonna keep going...

01:18:02.793 --> 01:18:04.874
until I get what I need from you
to raise your son.

01:18:04.913 --> 01:18:06.794
I'm doing the best that I can.

01:18:06.833 --> 01:18:09.113
But do you think your mouth
helps the situation?

01:18:09.193 --> 01:18:12.914
I'm just trying to deal with
this shit. I didn't ask for this.

01:18:12.993 --> 01:18:15.194
What, and I did?

01:18:15.274 --> 01:18:17.715
I climbed on top of myself
and got pregnant?

01:18:17.794 --> 01:18:20.475
You want me to take him
to my mother's?

01:18:20.555 --> 01:18:24.795
I'll take him.
Get his shit ready. Get him ready!

01:18:24.875 --> 01:18:28.596
Oh, no. You're not going
nowhere with my son tonight.

01:18:28.635 --> 01:18:30.836
Not on that temper,
and not with that attitude.

01:18:30.876 --> 01:18:33.677
Look, you know what? Fine. Then,
I won't take him. I'm outta here.

01:18:33.716 --> 01:18:37.276
Go ahead, leave.
That's what you're good at!

01:18:37.356 --> 01:18:40.037
Your son ain't seen nothing
but your back since he was born!

01:18:45.718 --> 01:18:49.917
Shawana Clarke.

01:18:53.198 --> 01:18:55.039
Do you want me
to take him?

01:18:55.118 --> 01:18:56.959
No.

01:18:57.039 --> 01:18:58.959
Travis, come here.
Come here, Travis.

01:18:59.039 --> 01:19:00.919
Travis, put that down.

01:19:03.959 --> 01:19:06.320
Excuse me. I have been here
for an hour and a half.

01:19:06.359 --> 01:19:08.600
Am I gonna be able
to see a doctor anytime soon?

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:12.280
I've already told you, we'll
get you in as soon as we can.

01:19:12.321 --> 01:19:14.680
My appointment was an hour ago.
I already got here early.

01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:17.240
We are doing the best we can.
We have a lot of people.

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:19.161
Is there somebody
else I can talk to?

01:19:31.242 --> 01:19:33.122
Wench. I gotta stand over her...

01:19:33.203 --> 01:19:35.282
to make sure she puts your name
on the damn list.

01:19:35.323 --> 01:19:37.203
Triflin' bitch.

01:19:38.762 --> 01:19:43.403
Okay. Ooo-kay.

01:19:43.484 --> 01:19:46.964
Yeah. Da da da da
da da da da.

01:19:47.044 --> 01:19:49.125
- I'll get that.

01:19:49.204 --> 01:19:51.045
Da da!

01:19:53.284 --> 01:19:55.764
I know. I know.
I know. I know.

01:19:56.925 --> 01:19:59.485
So, your dad's trippin'
about the fight.

01:19:59.565 --> 01:20:03.125
-Yeah.
-Probably thinks it's Derek's fault.

01:20:03.166 --> 01:20:05.885
No, I explained
about Nikki.

01:20:05.925 --> 01:20:09.726
So, you put it all on her.
None of it's on you.

01:20:12.766 --> 01:20:15.807
She started it.
I told you what she said.

01:20:15.887 --> 01:20:18.526
Maybe she didn't have no business
getting up in your face,

01:20:18.607 --> 01:20:20.927
but she had reason
to say what she said.

01:20:20.967 --> 01:20:23.688
Wait a minute.
You agree with her?

01:20:23.768 --> 01:20:27.408
You and Derek act like it don't
bother people to see you together.

01:20:27.488 --> 01:20:29.528
Like it don't
hurt people to see.

01:20:29.607 --> 01:20:32.609
Well, we like each other.

01:20:32.688 --> 01:20:37.209
What is the big damn deal? It's me
and him, not us and other people.

01:20:37.249 --> 01:20:40.609
Black people, Sara.
Black women.

01:20:40.690 --> 01:20:42.649
Derek's about something.

01:20:42.729 --> 01:20:45.490
He's smart. He's motivated.
He's for real.

01:20:45.569 --> 01:20:47.810
He's not gonna make babies
and not take care of them,

01:20:47.849 --> 01:20:49.850
or run the streets
messing up his life.

01:20:49.891 --> 01:20:52.370
He's gonna make something
of himself. And here you come-

01:20:52.451 --> 01:20:54.571
white, so you gotta be right-
and take one of the few...

01:20:54.651 --> 01:20:57.450
decent men we have left
after jail, drugs and drive-by.

01:20:57.531 --> 01:21:01.891
That is what Nikki meant
about you up in our world.

01:21:01.971 --> 01:21:03.852
There's only one world,
Chenille.

01:21:03.972 --> 01:21:07.173
That is what they teach you.
We know different.

01:21:07.252 --> 01:21:10.532
I-I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.

01:21:10.612 --> 01:21:15.253
You wanna be a friend?
Don't just be here to be here.

01:21:15.293 --> 01:21:18.974
Open up your pretty brown eyes
and look the hell around.

01:21:43.576 --> 01:21:45.417
Excuse me.

01:21:51.857 --> 01:21:55.137
Come on, Sara,
this is for your audition.

01:21:55.217 --> 01:21:59.057
Come on. No, no, no.
You're not attacking it.

01:21:59.137 --> 01:22:01.618
You're not working it, okay?
Come on now.

01:22:01.697 --> 01:22:03.538
I'll get it right
the next time.

01:22:03.618 --> 01:22:06.299
You don't have time.
You gotta get it right now.

01:22:06.378 --> 01:22:08.619
- I can't work like this.
- Like what?

01:22:08.699 --> 01:22:11.099
Like this, with you
dictating to me.

01:22:13.738 --> 01:22:16.739
All right.
Let's take a break.

01:22:20.739 --> 01:22:24.020
I'm sorry. It's just that
the audition's next week,

01:22:24.101 --> 01:22:26.059
and everything
is so messed up at school.

01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:28.381
I don't know. I'm feeling
a little bit weird.

01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:33.501
You know everything's
going to be okay.

01:22:33.541 --> 01:22:36.422
I feel it.

01:22:36.501 --> 01:22:39.021
So, you pick out
a dress yet?

01:22:39.101 --> 01:22:41.021
Dress?

01:22:41.102 --> 01:22:43.102
Yeah, you know, girls
wear those sometimes.

01:22:43.182 --> 01:22:46.223
Stepps.
Main Squeeze Night.

01:22:46.302 --> 01:22:49.223
Couples only Saturday night.

01:22:49.303 --> 01:22:51.143
We already talked
about this, remember?

01:22:51.222 --> 01:22:53.502
Yeah.

01:22:53.583 --> 01:22:56.063
We talked about it,
but I didn't know we decided on it.

01:22:56.143 --> 01:22:58.224
Well, it's Stepps.
What is there to decide on it?

01:22:59.823 --> 01:23:03.904
I don't know. I just thought that
with the fight and everything...

01:23:03.984 --> 01:23:06.464
that maybe we should cool it
for a little while.

01:23:06.504 --> 01:23:08.384
What?

01:23:11.505 --> 01:23:14.145
Well, uh,
what are you saying?

01:23:14.186 --> 01:23:16.465
Are you saying that
you don't wanna be with me?

01:23:16.544 --> 01:23:18.785
You don't wanna be seen with me?
What are you saying?

01:23:18.825 --> 01:23:20.706
I'm just saying
I'm confused, that's all.

01:23:20.746 --> 01:23:22.826
Confused about what?
Me?

01:23:22.906 --> 01:23:25.506
A little bit.

01:23:25.587 --> 01:23:28.866
I don't know.
Yeah... no... maybe.

01:23:28.906 --> 01:23:30.787
Maybe?

01:23:30.826 --> 01:23:33.747
So, hold on. What? Are we talking
about Stepps and school,

01:23:33.827 --> 01:23:37.947
or are you talking about the grocery
store, the sidewalk and museums?

01:23:38.028 --> 01:23:40.708
Break it down a little bit better
for me, 'cause I don't get it.

01:23:40.789 --> 01:23:43.628
When is it okay for us to be
together? To be seen together?

01:23:43.668 --> 01:23:45.749
Why are you getting mad?
I'm just being honest.

01:23:45.828 --> 01:23:47.828
Nobody wants to
see us together.

01:23:47.909 --> 01:23:50.749
We spend more time defending
our relationship than having one.

01:23:50.830 --> 01:23:52.710
It's just... so hard.

01:23:52.750 --> 01:23:55.789
Everything's gotta be easy? That's
the story of your life, not mine.

01:23:55.869 --> 01:23:57.670
You know this much
about my life.

01:23:57.709 --> 01:24:00.110
I know when shit gets rough,
you give up and punk out.

01:24:00.150 --> 01:24:02.471
Just the way you punked out
on ballet when your mom died.

01:24:02.510 --> 01:24:06.631
You don't know shit about my mother.
How dare you talk about my mom!

01:24:06.671 --> 01:24:08.550
God!

01:24:10.031 --> 01:24:12.271
I'm sorry.

01:24:13.791 --> 01:24:15.632
I shouldn't have
said that.

01:24:17.311 --> 01:24:18.872
It's just that...

01:24:18.953 --> 01:24:21.232
all this shit just kind of
caught me off guard.

01:24:22.832 --> 01:24:26.033
I mean, it's, like, damn,
you don't wanna be with me.

01:24:27.072 --> 01:24:29.833
Is that
what you're saying,

01:24:29.873 --> 01:24:31.753
that you don't
want to be with me?

01:24:31.794 --> 01:24:33.673
No, it's not like that.

01:24:33.713 --> 01:24:35.913
I'm trying to tell you how I feel,
and you're taking it personal.

01:24:35.954 --> 01:24:37.874
Let me tell you
something, Sara.

01:24:37.954 --> 01:24:41.194
I just hit the best friend I have
in the world in the face over you.

01:24:41.274 --> 01:24:43.394
I've been taking shit
from people I've known all my life.

01:24:43.475 --> 01:24:46.154
People I care about, that care
about me so I could be with you.

01:24:46.235 --> 01:24:48.395
Telling myself that
we are in this together.

01:24:48.474 --> 01:24:51.195
So, don't give me this "nothing
personal." I don't wanna hear it.

01:24:51.275 --> 01:24:54.436
Fine. If I'm messing up
your life so much,

01:24:54.515 --> 01:24:57.036
then maybe we
shouldn't be together.

01:24:59.595 --> 01:25:02.356
You know what?
I don't need this shit.

01:25:03.876 --> 01:25:05.717
I don't even know
why I bother.

01:25:05.797 --> 01:25:08.557
I'm out.

01:25:08.598 --> 01:25:10.478
The hell with it.

01:25:10.518 --> 01:25:12.397
The hell with you.

01:25:15.318 --> 01:25:19.878
I don't know
what I'm doing

01:25:19.958 --> 01:25:24.998
See, baby, I apologize

01:25:25.078 --> 01:25:29.319
For all the things that I've done
that I've done

01:25:29.399 --> 01:25:33.000
See, I know
that I've been a fool

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:37.039
For far too long, oh

01:25:37.079 --> 01:25:40.880
And maybe you'll have
a rumor on the way

01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:45.281
That comes back, Papa
Please baby, baby, stay

01:25:45.361 --> 01:25:51.561
If you really love me
then why are you leaving me

01:25:51.641 --> 01:25:54.081
I can't think

01:25:54.161 --> 01:25:56.042
- Hey, man.

01:25:56.122 --> 01:25:59.442
Uh, you know, about the other night.
I don't want there to be-

01:25:59.522 --> 01:26:03.002
Don't even worry about it, man.
My jaw's not made out of glass.

01:26:04.443 --> 01:26:07.523
Yeah, well, you know,
blood's thicker than blonds, right?

01:26:07.602 --> 01:26:09.843
So, you got my back
on Saturday?

01:26:11.364 --> 01:26:14.684
Derek... I ain't got
nobody else, man.

01:26:14.725 --> 01:26:16.604
- You got Lip.
- Lip?

01:26:16.683 --> 01:26:19.644
Man, that fool will get
a nigger killed quick, man.

01:26:19.724 --> 01:26:23.765
No, I need you there.

01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:25.885
47th Street,
under the El.

01:26:25.966 --> 01:26:28.445
I'll call you, man.

01:26:28.525 --> 01:26:30.325
Are you down?

01:26:31.685 --> 01:26:33.525
- Yeah, I'm down.
- All right, man.

01:26:35.246 --> 01:26:37.607
Let me get to class,
get some education like you.

01:26:37.686 --> 01:26:39.527
All right.

01:26:46.287 --> 01:26:51.128
I don't care about
how much that you got

01:26:51.208 --> 01:26:55.448
'Cause your cigs, your lips
your jigs don't ever start it

01:26:55.528 --> 01:26:59.409
Oh, you're just another

01:26:59.488 --> 01:27:03.290
Undercover poser, loser

01:27:03.369 --> 01:27:05.210
Acting like a boy

01:27:05.289 --> 01:27:09.289
So, if you got dough, lain't
hearing you got a bad Joe

01:27:09.369 --> 01:27:12.930
But lain't hearing that bona fide
code, That ain't good enough

01:27:13.010 --> 01:27:15.570
'Cause you ain't no-o-o-o

01:27:15.650 --> 01:27:20.410
Ain't no place in the game
Ain't no way that children play

01:27:26.332 --> 01:27:29.052
Uh...

01:27:29.132 --> 01:27:33.732
I don't wanna bug you. I just
came in here to say good luck.

01:27:35.652 --> 01:27:37.532
So, tomorrow's
the big day, huh?

01:27:37.573 --> 01:27:40.253
Yeah.

01:27:40.293 --> 01:27:44.014
- You scared?
- Shitless.

01:27:46.413 --> 01:27:50.253
You got a minute for your old man?
I wanna show you something.

01:27:50.373 --> 01:27:52.054
Sure.

01:28:11.495 --> 01:28:14.976
Be careful.
That wall, it's, uh,

01:28:15.056 --> 01:28:16.937
still wet.

01:28:33.578 --> 01:28:35.939
That's your mother
when she was 19,

01:28:35.979 --> 01:28:38.459
when I first met her.

01:28:38.538 --> 01:28:41.179
I know.

01:28:41.259 --> 01:28:45.219
It's just a start. I mean, I know
you're too old for a twin bed.

01:28:45.259 --> 01:28:48.700
It's a nice bed, Roy.

01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:54.860
You know, I-I didn't mean
to mess up your life.

01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:58.341
Or your mother's.

01:28:59.941 --> 01:29:04.822
And I don't deserve a second chance
to be your father,

01:29:04.901 --> 01:29:07.461
but I'm hoping
you'll give me one anyway.

01:29:09.262 --> 01:29:11.263
You know, way back when...

01:29:13.423 --> 01:29:16.582
I thought I had all the time
in the world to get to know you,

01:29:16.662 --> 01:29:18.862
for you to get to know me.

01:29:20.743 --> 01:29:24.183
But... one day...

01:29:24.264 --> 01:29:26.184
wake up, you look around.

01:29:27.663 --> 01:29:31.144
All you got to show
for yourself is a...

01:29:31.184 --> 01:29:33.865
beautiful, talented,
little girl.

01:29:35.265 --> 01:29:37.105
Young woman...

01:29:38.385 --> 01:29:40.264
who hates you.

01:29:40.305 --> 01:29:42.385
I don't hate you.

01:29:44.186 --> 01:29:46.066
I miss her.

01:29:54.386 --> 01:29:57.227
I miss her so much.

01:30:05.589 --> 01:30:08.468
God, everything
is so screwed up.

01:30:10.388 --> 01:30:12.709
Derek is mad at me.

01:30:12.788 --> 01:30:14.709
He's not gonna come
tomorrow.

01:30:16.349 --> 01:30:18.190
I want him to be there.

01:30:19.309 --> 01:30:21.309
I need him to be there.

01:30:23.869 --> 01:30:26.830
I just want someone there
who loves me.

01:30:29.431 --> 01:30:31.630
I love you.

01:30:45.431 --> 01:30:48.152
Whoa! Hey.

01:30:55.394 --> 01:30:58.032
Why are you so quiet?

01:30:58.113 --> 01:30:59.993
I don't feel like talking.

01:31:00.033 --> 01:31:02.634
Derek, there's something
I oughta tell you.

01:31:02.713 --> 01:31:05.714
I said something to Sara.

01:31:05.754 --> 01:31:08.434
What?
What did you say?

01:31:08.515 --> 01:31:11.154
Stuff.

01:31:11.234 --> 01:31:14.874
About how maybe Nikki had a point
about black men and white women.

01:31:14.955 --> 01:31:17.196
What?
You said what?

01:31:17.275 --> 01:31:20.915
I'm sorry.
I-I don't even like Nikki.

01:31:20.996 --> 01:31:22.835
I was trippin' off Kenny.

01:31:24.395 --> 01:31:28.796
You can't help who you love, Derek.
You're not supposed to.

01:31:28.876 --> 01:31:31.756
When you love somebody,
you love them.

01:31:31.837 --> 01:31:34.717
Look at me.

01:31:34.758 --> 01:31:37.997
At least you found somebody
who loves you back.

01:31:38.077 --> 01:31:40.117
I gotta go.

01:31:40.157 --> 01:31:42.358
Where you going?

01:31:42.398 --> 01:31:45.558
Stay out of my business,
Chenille.

01:31:45.599 --> 01:31:48.598
I know what Malakai
wants you to do.

01:31:48.678 --> 01:31:50.519
Why are you trippin'
off him, Derek?

01:31:50.598 --> 01:31:52.918
All you're trying to do
is get the hell up out of here.

01:31:52.999 --> 01:31:55.159
Ain't no shame or blame in that.

01:31:55.239 --> 01:31:58.480
It's getting cold out here.
Take that baby inside.

01:32:23.682 --> 01:32:27.602
Hey.

01:32:39.883 --> 01:32:42.244
Kai, I've been trying
to catch up with you.

01:32:43.484 --> 01:32:45.324
I gotta talk to you.

01:32:45.405 --> 01:32:47.244
- Ready to roll?
- I gotta talk to you.

01:32:48.885 --> 01:32:51.005
- Wassup?
- Look, man. I ain't going with you.

01:32:51.085 --> 01:32:53.205
What you mean
you're not going?

01:32:53.285 --> 01:32:56.246
-You know what I mean.
-Did you come here to waste my time?

01:32:56.325 --> 01:33:00.046
This shit is nonsense, Kai.
It's dangerous nonsense.

01:33:00.126 --> 01:33:03.686
Just back up off it, man. Come on.
I'll go with you if you go home.

01:33:03.767 --> 01:33:07.366
Go home? Get the hell away from me,
you punk-ass bitch.

01:33:07.446 --> 01:33:10.806
You're the one don't have the balls.
to walk away from this shit.

01:33:10.887 --> 01:33:13.727
I should have took your ass
to jail along with mine, man.

01:33:13.768 --> 01:33:16.287
But you didn't, so you do not
have to get in that car.

01:33:16.368 --> 01:33:20.608
Malakai, you are so much
smarter than this shit.

01:33:20.648 --> 01:33:23.809
I know what you can be.
I know what you're capable of.

01:33:23.888 --> 01:33:25.729
Let's just walk away.

01:33:25.809 --> 01:33:28.489
Walk away to what?
I'm not you, Derek.

01:33:28.569 --> 01:33:30.529
I can't do nothing
but what I'm doing.

01:33:30.608 --> 01:33:32.929
I can't go to Georgetown
with a 10.0 G.P.A.,

01:33:32.969 --> 01:33:35.169
operating on people,
doing brain surgery...

01:33:35.249 --> 01:33:37.490
- or whatever you're gonna be doing.
- You can, man.

01:33:37.569 --> 01:33:40.570
- If I can do it, you can do it.
- All I have is my respect.

01:33:40.650 --> 01:33:43.370
And that's what I gotta
go take care of.

01:33:43.449 --> 01:33:46.250
You wanna bail out
on me, man? That's fine.

01:33:46.330 --> 01:33:49.691
But you can kiss my ass
with all your future bullshit.

01:33:49.771 --> 01:33:53.211
I know who the hell I am...
right now.

01:33:54.892 --> 01:33:56.931
Kai, man, wait, man.

01:33:59.852 --> 01:34:01.692
Let's go, man.

01:34:25.614 --> 01:34:27.334
Sara?

01:34:31.296 --> 01:34:33.056
Ready to go?

01:34:33.136 --> 01:34:35.055
Um-

01:34:37.535 --> 01:34:39.376
Yes. Yes.

01:34:54.738 --> 01:34:56.538
Sara!

01:35:00.297 --> 01:35:02.178
Sara Johnson?

01:36:56.110 --> 01:36:57.990
Aah!

01:37:24.633 --> 01:37:27.313
Miss Johnson,
we meet again.

01:37:27.353 --> 01:37:29.874
I assume you prepared
a contemporary piece.

01:37:29.954 --> 01:37:33.234
Yes, sir. They have my music.

01:37:58.677 --> 01:38:01.236
Hold it. Hold it. Cut the music.

01:38:01.317 --> 01:38:03.597
I'm sorry, sir.
I wasn't ready.

01:38:05.958 --> 01:38:08.558
Are you ready now?

01:38:18.118 --> 01:38:19.959
Yes, sir, she's ready!

01:38:22.399 --> 01:38:25.198
Youngman, excuse me.
This is an audition.

01:38:26.639 --> 01:38:29.400
Who let him in here?

01:38:29.479 --> 01:38:32.080
How did he get in here?
He's not supposed to be there.

01:38:33.921 --> 01:38:35.801
- Youngman!
- You can do this.

01:38:35.841 --> 01:38:38.881
- I messed up. It's too late.
- It is not too late.

01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:42.001
- Miss Johnson.
- You can do it.

01:38:42.041 --> 01:38:45.121
- Sara, you were born to do it.

01:38:45.202 --> 01:38:49.242
- That judge hates me.
- Forget him.

01:38:50.761 --> 01:38:53.242
Ain't nobody watching you
but me.

01:38:53.322 --> 01:38:55.162
All right?

01:38:57.683 --> 01:39:00.284
Now show me some attitude.

01:39:02.403 --> 01:39:04.283
Miss Johnson,
we don't have time for this.

01:39:06.003 --> 01:39:08.003
Are you ready to continue?

01:39:08.084 --> 01:39:10.804
- Miss Johnson!
- I'm ready.

01:40:04.090 --> 01:40:07.930
Live your dreams
It's not as hard as it may seem

01:40:08.010 --> 01:40:13.850
Gotta work to get the cream
on your hopes you must lean

01:40:13.890 --> 01:40:17.771
From your fears

01:40:17.851 --> 01:40:23.171
It's all or nothing
Give your everything

01:40:33.372 --> 01:40:35.613
It' shit or miss

01:40:35.653 --> 01:40:38.973
Too late for you to quit

01:40:39.053 --> 01:40:42.054
You gotta show 'em
how bad you really want this

01:40:42.133 --> 01:40:46.493
Live your dreams
It's not as hard as it may seem

01:40:46.533 --> 01:40:51.975
Gotta work to get the cream
On your hopes you must lean

01:40:52.014 --> 01:40:56.975
From your fears

Whoo! Yeah! That's what
I'm talkin' about, baby.

01:41:52.821 --> 01:41:55.341
Look, all due respect, if you don't
let this girl in, you're crazy.

01:41:58.141 --> 01:42:00.542
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.

01:42:00.622 --> 01:42:03.262
Miss Johnson,

01:42:03.341 --> 01:42:06.222
