00:03.503 --> 00:05.422
It looks like we have our new Ellie.

00:05.964 --> 00:07.132
[Cocó] Congratulations, Laura.

00:07.215 --> 00:08.550

00:08.633 --> 00:10.969
[Caterina] <i>I don't know</i>
<i>what I'm going to do about Diego.</i>

00:11.052 --> 00:12.429
The tour is going to take forever.

00:12.512 --> 00:14.389
[Allegra] <i>And aren't you going</i>
<i>to miss your mom?</i>

00:14.472 --> 00:17.225
[Caterina] <i>She doesn't understand me.</i>
<i>I suppose I learned to love her.</i>

00:17.851 --> 00:19.019
[Allegra] <i>My mom loved Cocó.</i>

00:19.102 --> 00:21.855
Something happened to cause her
to separate from my grandmother.

00:21.938 --> 00:25.191
Maybe it has something to do with
what happened opening day with the fire.

00:26.359 --> 00:27.819
[Caterina] <i>That night I lost everything.</i>

00:27.902 --> 00:29.821
I lost my friend. I lost my boyfriend.

00:29.904 --> 00:31.072
And I lost my mom.

00:31.156 --> 00:33.283
[Marco] <i>I think</i>
<i>it would be better if you go.</i>

00:33.366 --> 00:35.535
Sometimes I don't know
if it would be better

00:35.618 --> 00:37.454
to run a bulldozer over the theater,

00:37.537 --> 00:40.123
collect the insurance and be done with it,
you know?

00:40.206 --> 00:41.249
Hey!

00:41.332 --> 00:43.209
-[gasps]
-[screams]

00:43.293 --> 00:45.795
I know you. Bárbara Diz?

00:53.136 --> 00:55.430
What happened that night was total chaos.

00:56.848 --> 00:59.434
After the fire,
they shut down the theater.

01:00.268 --> 01:01.603
And the worst thing

01:01.686 --> 01:04.230
was that they blamed Dad
for everything that happened.

01:04.314 --> 01:06.983
And he's 200% innocent.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.361
Are you sure he had nothing to do with it?

01:09.444 --> 01:11.196
Of course, sweetie.

01:11.279 --> 01:13.823
Dad loves this theater.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.284
He would never have done anything
to destroy it.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.330
Don't believe me?

01:22.165 --> 01:23.375
Ask him yourself.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.878
-Tomás is here?
-[laughing]

01:27.796 --> 01:29.798
Of course! Where else would he be?

01:32.384 --> 01:36.596
Come. Come on in. Here he is.

01:40.475 --> 01:43.895
In the movies, nothing good ever happens
when the chair turns around.

01:50.318 --> 01:52.946
Sweeties, aren't you going to say hello?

01:53.822 --> 01:55.240
Uh, yes. Um…

01:56.366 --> 01:57.534
Hello, Tomás.

01:57.617 --> 01:59.077
[chuckles]

01:59.160 --> 02:01.579
It's a pleasure meeting you.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.289
I pictured him being taller, no?

02:05.375 --> 02:07.252
I think I know you from somewhere.

02:08.712 --> 02:10.463
No way. No, we've never met before.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.090
-No, no.
-Hmm.

02:12.173 --> 02:15.593
You said you were going to show us
some of your treasures.

02:15.677 --> 02:16.761
Yes! Of course.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.813
My most valuable treasures.

02:28.231 --> 02:31.776
I stored some things away
so the police wouldn't take them.

02:33.653 --> 02:38.033
Dad gave me this doll
right after he bought the theater.

02:38.700 --> 02:39.909
Oh!

02:44.748 --> 02:48.084
The <i>Freaky Friday</i> hourglass.
It's beautiful.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.627
Now I know where I know you from.

02:49.711 --> 02:52.088
-We have to go. It's getting late and--
-Yes.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.674
-Bye-bye. Thank you for everything--
-It can't be. Is that you?

02:54.758 --> 02:57.135
I think you have me confused
with someone else.

02:57.218 --> 02:59.262
-Yeah, yeah, totally.
-Don't lie, Laura.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.598
It's you. You haven't changed.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.600
I tell her that all the time.
All the time.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.518
She's a spitting image of her mother.

03:05.602 --> 03:06.603
What?

03:07.979 --> 03:10.273
She's Caterina Sharp's daughter.

03:10.357 --> 03:14.027
They look like clones, don't they?
People get them confused.

03:14.110 --> 03:17.364
-[laughs]
-[Allegra chuckles]

03:20.158 --> 03:24.913
Oh, no wonder your face
looked familiar to me.

03:24.996 --> 03:26.456
You're a Sharp.

03:26.539 --> 03:29.209
I hate all of you. Especially Cocó.

03:29.751 --> 03:32.128
-What did my grandmother do to you?
-They betrayed us.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.923
Even my best friend betrayed me.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.259
Greta stole the love of my life.

03:38.343 --> 03:40.720
And she showed no mercy to Marco.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.306
What are you talking about?
What happened to Marco?

03:43.807 --> 03:44.933
Oh, sweeties.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.352
On opening night,

03:47.435 --> 03:50.105
Marco and Laura were together.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.524
Greta knew it.

03:52.607 --> 03:55.110
She swore she would get revenge on them.

03:57.153 --> 03:58.154
And she did.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.584
INTERTWINED

04:12.168 --> 04:13.336
That's what I'm saying.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.797
If you hadn't shown up,
I don't know what would've happened.

04:15.880 --> 04:20.844
And you probably would've ended up
sharing Tomás's urn on the spinning chair.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.930
-[chuckles] No, really. Thank you.
-[sighs]

04:24.014 --> 04:26.766
It makes me happy
to know I can count on you again.

04:26.850 --> 04:31.104
No, don't get any ideas.
This doesn't change a single thing. Hmm?

04:31.187 --> 04:34.983
I still think it's an epic fail you're
spending this much energy on the past.

04:36.609 --> 04:37.861
[sighs]

04:37.944 --> 04:41.448
But, well, I imagine you're happy
that you got the part of Ellie.

04:41.531 --> 04:44.117
Yes. But I couldn't have done it
on my own.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.662
Without the help of my mom in the past,
and my grandma in the present,

04:47.746 --> 04:49.247
I wouldn't have beaten Greta.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.880
The only way to fix things between them

04:56.963 --> 04:59.257
is to find out what happened
on opening night.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.510
[sighs] Mom, Cocó…

05:03.720 --> 05:06.181
Greta, Tomás,

05:06.848 --> 05:09.351
Diego, Marco…

05:10.393 --> 05:12.312
They all seem like pieces of the puzzle,

05:12.395 --> 05:14.647
but I don't understand
how they fit together yet.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.858
[sucks teeth, sighs]

05:16.941 --> 05:18.276
I know.

05:18.360 --> 05:23.114
What if you look
for another piece of the puzzle?

05:23.907 --> 05:26.868
I don't know.
Another performer in the company. Hmm?

05:26.951 --> 05:30.622
Someone who knew Marco too.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.792
Yes. I know who.

05:33.875 --> 05:34.876
Who?

05:34.959 --> 05:37.462
Dante. He's the other member of Serotonin.

05:37.545 --> 05:40.507
There you have it.
And don't forget the VHS tapes, okay?

05:40.590 --> 05:46.262
What I don't know is where you're going
to find a VCR in 2021.

05:46.346 --> 05:49.599
-[laughs] Don't worry. Come on, let's go.
-No, I can't.

05:50.308 --> 05:54.396
I have to rehearse the short with Sofía.

05:55.730 --> 05:56.731
With Sofía?

05:58.274 --> 06:01.695
Didn't I tell you?
She's the new lead in the short.

06:21.297 --> 06:23.258
Want me to play it again?

06:23.341 --> 06:26.886
No. I don't want you to move a millimeter.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.472
[scoffs] So what am I? A pillow?

06:30.390 --> 06:33.435
Yes, and I want to keep my pillow forever.

06:33.518 --> 06:36.396
Mmm. I think…

06:36.479 --> 06:40.483
It seems to me that the Sharp girl
isn't used to working.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.945
Honestly, I understand Greta
a little bit better now.

06:44.738 --> 06:48.616
I don't know how she can stand the noise
of the games all day long.

06:49.826 --> 06:53.038
-Cocó Sharp's perfect punishment.
-[chuckles]

06:54.622 --> 06:58.877
But going to the literary workshop
turned my day around.

06:59.461 --> 07:00.462
Oh, yeah?

07:01.296 --> 07:03.506
I thought I was the one
who turned your day around.

07:10.221 --> 07:11.222
Ahem.

07:11.973 --> 07:14.225
Cocó! [chuckles] Hello.

07:14.309 --> 07:15.769
Caterina and I were just--

07:15.852 --> 07:18.229
Can you please leave me alone
with my daughter?

07:18.313 --> 07:19.356
We need to talk.

07:19.981 --> 07:20.982
Yes.

07:24.611 --> 07:25.695
[door shuts]

07:25.779 --> 07:28.281
I just spoke with Greta's mom.

07:29.199 --> 07:31.576
I don't understand
what's going on with you, Caterina.

07:31.659 --> 07:34.788
On that, we can agree.
You never understood me.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.123
You give me no choice.

-[music stops]

08:05.193 --> 08:08.321
Uh, we're trying out some arrangements
for the demo.

08:09.364 --> 08:11.241
Oh, okay.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.244
I thought I was in the band.
Thank you for inviting me.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.995
Come on, quit it with the drama.

08:16.079 --> 08:19.040
Don't be offended.
I told you I wanted to try something new.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.917
And I told you I wanted to record my song.

08:21.001 --> 08:24.546
Yes, but I think you're a bit confused.
Our band doesn't have a front man.

08:24.629 --> 08:27.257
-So you can't decide everything.
-Neither can you.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.176
Dante agrees with me.

08:30.969 --> 08:31.970
Don't you?

08:32.053 --> 08:33.179
Oh, yeah?

08:33.847 --> 08:38.435
Uh--
Well, I think Marco's idea is a good one.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.604
-It doesn't hurt to try it out.
-Okay.

08:42.605 --> 08:44.858
We have a date to record our demo.

08:45.442 --> 08:49.237
There's no time for you to keep toying
with being Gen X's David Bowie, Marco.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.156
[exclaims] Your attitude is exhausting.

08:51.239 --> 08:53.241
Oh, yeah? And I…

08:54.367 --> 08:57.412
I'm exhausted by getting roped
into your lies with your dad.

08:58.580 --> 09:01.958
What does that have to do with it?
We're talking about music, Diego.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.210
Exactly. Exactly.

09:04.294 --> 09:06.755
-Hmm.
-You're acting like you're a rebel rocker

when you're actually a baby
afraid to confront his dad.

09:09.090 --> 09:12.927
[scoffs] No. I won't play your game.
I'm not the least bit interested.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.596
But I will say one thing.

09:14.679 --> 09:17.682
If you don't open your mind a little
and take it down a gear,

09:17.766 --> 09:19.184
we're not going to have a demo.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.523
[door opens, shuts]

09:26.858 --> 09:28.818
[Tomás] We've talked about this
20 times. Please.

09:28.902 --> 09:29.986
-Come on.
-Again.

09:30.070 --> 09:33.698
No, you promised me that you'd convince
Caterina to play Ellie.

09:33.782 --> 09:36.618
Laura is very talented.
She may not be a Sharp, but she's special.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.536
Talent isn't a synonym for success, Cocó.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.872
People want to see the two Sharp women
together on stage.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.540
Nobody is going to pay to see someone
they don't know.

09:42.624 --> 09:43.750
[gasps] Tomás.

09:43.833 --> 09:47.253
You see the state of the lighting console?
I invested a fortune in this show.

09:47.837 --> 09:50.548
I am so deep in debt I couldn't make
necessary repairs to the theater.

09:50.632 --> 09:53.009
I wanted to install all new electrical,
Cocó.

09:53.093 --> 09:56.262
Well, that's your problem, Tomás.
You accepted the new budget.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.683
Because you promised me a smash hit.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.726
And it will be.
It's going to be a smash hit.

10:01.810 --> 10:04.020
And Caterina will come back eventually.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.855
-I'm here.
-What are you doing here?

10:06.898 --> 10:08.191
I asked her to come.

10:08.942 --> 10:12.487
I wanted to speak with her.
Caterina is like a daughter to me.

10:14.489 --> 10:17.450
You're not the best person
to solve this problem.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.703

10:20.662 --> 10:23.456

10:39.848 --> 10:41.099
I love you too.

Let's get straight to the point.

I'm willing to do whatever it takes
for you to come back.

10:55.530 --> 10:56.781
Tell me what you want.

11:00.702 --> 11:01.870

11:02.537 --> 11:04.873
I would love to say yes to you…

11:06.624 --> 11:09.252

I want the handheld to be quicker, okay?

12:32.502 --> 12:35.964
And when she turns around,
I want to feel her fear. Okay?

12:36.047 --> 12:39.676
I want the shot to be really close up.
I want goose bumps. Okay? Nothing less.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.052
Um…

12:41.136 --> 12:43.722
Hurry up because we need
to stick to the shooting schedule. Okay?

12:43.805 --> 12:44.806
Please, guys.

12:45.724 --> 12:48.309
Could we stay one more hour?

12:48.393 --> 12:49.436
-No problem.
-Could we?

12:49.519 --> 12:51.354
The additional hour
will be at double the rate.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.939
How is the set design going?

12:53.023 --> 12:54.941
But that's not
what we agreed on yesterday.

12:55.025 --> 12:59.738
[giggles] I scared you.
No problem, sweetie.

12:59.821 --> 13:03.908
I already told you.
Dad is happy to have you. So happy!

13:03.992 --> 13:05.076
Thank you.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.912
And? How did I look?

13:07.996 --> 13:11.041
Um, scared. [chuckles]

13:11.124 --> 13:12.834
That's the point, right?

13:12.917 --> 13:14.044
Yes. Uh…

13:16.129 --> 13:17.130
Come here.

13:18.506 --> 13:19.841
Let's see.

13:19.924 --> 13:23.928
It's not exactly the fear I need.

13:24.721 --> 13:30.477
You need to stop faking fear
and start feeling it for real.

13:30.560 --> 13:35.482
Because you're not transmitting
what I'm looking for.

13:35.565 --> 13:36.983
Have you changed your mind?

13:37.067 --> 13:38.860
No. No, no, no, no, no.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.195
Uh, you see,

13:40.278 --> 13:44.282
fear is an intense emotion, right?

13:44.366 --> 13:48.244
It can push us to act,
or it might paralyze us.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.914
Have you ever been paralyzed with fear?

13:50.997 --> 13:53.792
You couldn't speak or your voice cracked?

13:55.543 --> 13:57.962
Okay. Close your eyes.

13:59.047 --> 14:01.132
Close your eyes and relax.
Close your eyes.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.636
Remember that moment.

14:05.970 --> 14:08.431
Try to relive it.

14:11.142 --> 14:12.143
Okay.

14:14.104 --> 14:16.189
What do you see? Hmm?

14:16.272 --> 14:18.274
Why are you afraid?

14:20.360 --> 14:21.861
The theater is full of people.

14:22.904 --> 14:26.616
The music starts, but I can't move.

14:28.618 --> 14:29.744
I can't sing.

14:31.121 --> 14:33.665
I want to leave. I want to run away.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.333
What are you so afraid of?

14:36.042 --> 14:37.502
Why can't you move?

14:38.420 --> 14:40.296
There's a person looking at me.

14:41.923 --> 14:45.176
They won't stop looking at me,
and I can't maintain eye contact.

14:47.637 --> 14:49.431
My body won't--

14:49.514 --> 14:54.060
I can't move. My body--
I start to tremble…

14:59.566 --> 15:00.567
It's my mom.

15:04.654 --> 15:06.239
[clears throat] Okay.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.242
When you doubt yourself…

15:14.581 --> 15:16.249
look at me. Hmm?

15:16.332 --> 15:19.002
Because I believe and trust in you.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.087
Okay?

15:35.643 --> 15:37.687
Mom, do we happen to have a VCR?

15:38.897 --> 15:39.898
Yes.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.735
Cool. Where?

15:44.778 --> 15:49.324
The VCR is somewhere in this house.

15:49.407 --> 15:52.035
[chuckles] I love your system.
Super useful.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.788
Mm. Why do you want a VCR?

15:55.330 --> 15:57.457
Uh, I need it for Félix's short.

15:58.041 --> 16:01.503
I'll look for it later. The only thing is,
I have no idea how to connect it.

16:01.586 --> 16:04.172
Don't worry about it.
I'll ask Félix to help me later.

16:04.255 --> 16:05.840
Mmm-hmm-hmm.

16:05.924 --> 16:07.801
A good excuse to see him again.

16:09.219 --> 16:11.721
Many a love story
was born out of a friendship.

16:11.805 --> 16:15.225
[chuckles] Well, this friendship
came without that seed.

16:15.308 --> 16:18.687
I'm just telling you
in case my opinion matters to you.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.439
Félix is a good guy.

16:22.816 --> 16:26.194
You know who is a good guy? The gardener.

16:27.112 --> 16:29.823
-Don't you like him?
-Allegra.

16:29.906 --> 16:33.284
What I'm trying to tell you is that
you can talk to me about these things.

16:33.368 --> 16:35.745
I'm not going to talk to you
about these things, Mom.

16:35.829 --> 16:38.915
-We're not friends.
-But we could be in the future.

16:40.291 --> 16:41.459
Or in the past.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.339
[door opens, shuts]

16:50.218 --> 16:51.761
[body thuds]

16:52.929 --> 16:54.597
How are you, Allegra?

16:54.681 --> 16:57.183
[sighs] I'm working on my aim.

16:57.976 --> 16:59.602
My flowers would be so grateful.

17:00.395 --> 17:01.396
Is Caterina home?

17:02.355 --> 17:04.566
Caterina can't have friends over.

17:04.649 --> 17:06.026
Why? What happened?

17:06.109 --> 17:07.527
More of the same. Cocó.

17:10.739 --> 17:13.533
If you're thinking of getting in
through the window, forget about it.

17:13.616 --> 17:16.077
I wouldn't recommend
defying my daughter right now.

17:17.495 --> 17:19.831
Could you at least let Caterina know
I came by?

17:20.457 --> 17:21.541
Of course.

17:21.624 --> 17:25.045
And could you let me know next time
you want to go through my things?

17:29.466 --> 17:30.842
Sorry.

17:30.925 --> 17:34.679
I needed to find something to help me
understand how the bracelet works.

17:37.307 --> 17:40.060
And I found this photo
where you are hugging,

17:40.685 --> 17:41.770
uh…

17:43.563 --> 17:44.564
Eusebio.

17:46.358 --> 17:47.567
That sounds interesting.

17:49.361 --> 17:50.362
Who was Eusebio?

17:52.781 --> 17:54.574
Eusebio was the love of my life.

17:55.825 --> 17:58.161
I met him on my first trip to the past.

18:22.018 --> 18:24.646
[Lucía] <i>I saw him</i>
<i>as soon as I arrived in 1869.</i>

18:25.355 --> 18:29.401

18:33.988 --> 18:37.701

18:42.539 --> 18:44.165
<i>I thought only of him.</i>

18:44.249 --> 18:47.794
<i>I was convinced</i>
<i>that Eusebio was part of my destiny.</i>

18:49.796 --> 18:52.465
<i>When only one knot remained, I despaired.</i>

18:53.633 --> 18:56.553
<i>I couldn't accept</i>
<i>that we'd never see each other again.</i>

18:58.972 --> 19:03.101
<i>I thought I could defy time</i>
<i>and have Eusebio travel with me.</i>

19:14.571 --> 19:19.617
But no one who is not wearing the bracelet
can cross the time boundary.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.329
I was selfish.

19:25.957 --> 19:27.334
Eusebio died because of me.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.587
Because I tried to defy the bracelet.

19:33.173 --> 19:35.550
I don't want the same thing
to happen to you.

19:35.633 --> 19:37.010
Listen to me, Allegra.

19:38.136 --> 19:39.262

What are you doing here? Hello, Diego.

21:54.522 --> 21:55.648
Can I come in?

21:55.732 --> 21:56.733
Uh, yes.

22:02.572 --> 22:04.949
If you're here looking for Allegra
about the audition,

22:05.033 --> 22:07.410
I already told her clearly
that I wouldn't sign the permission--

22:07.494 --> 22:08.495
Caterina.

22:08.578 --> 22:10.413
Don't insist.
You're not going to convince me.

22:10.497 --> 22:12.582
-Would you let me speak?
-Yes.

22:12.665 --> 22:16.252
I didn't come to talk about Allegra.
I came to see you.

22:16.336 --> 22:17.462

22:19.506 --> 22:21.216
-How are you?
-Fine.

22:24.386 --> 22:26.721
Ah. I'm getting better.

22:27.430 --> 22:29.683
And now that Cocó left,
I feel much better.

22:33.311 --> 22:35.522
You knew perfectly well
that I had forbidden Caterina

22:35.605 --> 22:37.816
from having a relationship
with someone in the company.

22:37.899 --> 22:41.528
Yes. Yes, that's true. I knew that, but--

22:41.611 --> 22:43.863
But it didn't stop you
from challenging my authority.

22:45.198 --> 22:47.325
I apologize, Cocó. Really.

22:47.867 --> 22:51.621
-I never thought that--
-That's the point. You didn't think.

22:54.666 --> 22:56.084
[sighs]

22:59.004 --> 23:03.383
Your relationship with Caterina
could have grave consequences

23:03.466 --> 23:04.926
for you and your career.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.896
Or it could be a great opportunity.

23:17.856 --> 23:19.649
Well, it's a bit more disorganized,

23:19.733 --> 23:22.444
but it feels the same
as the last time I was here.

23:23.278 --> 23:28.241
So you mean that all the effort I put in
to removing Cocó's presence was in vain?

23:29.242 --> 23:30.660
You're still fighting?

23:31.244 --> 23:33.496
Let's just say that less time with Cocó--

23:33.580 --> 23:35.206
More mental health.

23:35.290 --> 23:39.252
Mmm. Just know that I've spent
the last few days living with her.

Sofi, we're going to get a drink
with the crew. Want to join us?

27:09.963 --> 27:11.798
-Yeah. Okay.
-Yeah? Okay. Let's go.

27:23.226 --> 27:26.438
You were very good, but it's not enough.

27:27.605 --> 27:32.152
Opening day is right around the corner.
Your performances need to be perfect.

27:33.194 --> 27:35.947
Diego, congratulations.

27:36.906 --> 27:39.200
You were much better
than I thought you would be.

27:39.284 --> 27:41.786
You connected with Laura very well.

27:41.870 --> 27:45.290
It's decided. You'll play Adam.

27:46.875 --> 27:49.502
Everyone get some rest.
I'll see you at our next rehearsal.

27:51.546 --> 27:54.883
Marco. I can't believe that Cocó
would do that because of a rehearsal.

27:54.966 --> 27:57.427
-I'm sorry. It was my fault.
-Don't say that.

27:57.510 --> 27:58.636
Cocó is so unfair.

27:59.220 --> 28:01.681
If it weren't for me,
you'd still be playing Adam.

28:01.765 --> 28:03.892
Cocó is famous
for making last-minute changes.

28:03.975 --> 28:06.978
If she changed the part of Ellie,
it makes sense that she would change Adam.

28:07.062 --> 28:09.647
-Don't tell me that. Now I feel worse.
-[chuckles]

28:10.857 --> 28:14.361
I don't care what part I play if,
in real life, I'm with the girl I like.

28:15.695 --> 28:18.573
That's the lead I want.

28:23.119 --> 28:26.623
I see it, but I don't believe it.

28:26.706 --> 28:28.667
Marco Resco is in love.

28:30.251 --> 28:32.545
I was Marco's girlfriend too.

28:32.629 --> 28:35.382
Yeah, I know you were his girlfriend,
but it was different.

28:35.465 --> 28:37.592
He was a different guy.
It wasn't the same.

28:37.676 --> 28:40.553
He was different. You can tell now he's--
he's changed.

28:42.806 --> 28:45.225
-Are you doing this to me on purpose?
-What are you talking about?

28:45.308 --> 28:47.602
You love humiliating me
in front of everyone.

28:47.686 --> 28:50.230
It wasn't enough to steal the part
of Ellie from me?

28:50.313 --> 28:52.440
Greta, I didn't steal anything from you.
I earned the part.

28:52.524 --> 28:54.609
You stole my leading part
and my boyfriend.

28:54.693 --> 28:56.152
Greta, could you calm down?

28:56.236 --> 28:58.279
Thank you, but I can defend myself.

28:59.114 --> 29:01.449
When will you accept that
your relationship with Marco is over?

29:01.533 --> 29:03.410
Our relationship isn't over.
You destroyed it.

29:03.493 --> 29:05.912
You destroyed our relationship,
and you destroyed my career.

29:05.995 --> 29:07.831
And I swear you will regret it.

29:08.540 --> 29:09.541
And you too.

29:10.583 --> 29:12.502
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

29:16.381 --> 29:17.799
I hate this place!

29:17.882 --> 29:19.384
[door slams]

29:19.467 --> 29:21.428
[Caterina's voice] <i>A future together</i>

29:21.511 --> 29:24.764
<i>in a time that is neither yours nor mine.</i>

29:25.557 --> 29:28.393
-<i>Where each of us can be ourselves…</i>
-[door opens]

29:28.476 --> 29:30.687
<i>…without sacrificing anything</i>
<i>for the other.</i>

29:34.190 --> 29:35.191
Hey. Sweetheart.

29:35.275 --> 29:38.862
-Hi.
-So? How did the rehearsal go?

29:40.363 --> 29:43.450
Fine. Fine. Um…

29:46.161 --> 29:48.747
-What?
-Cocó gave me the part of Adam.

29:48.830 --> 29:50.707
-Hey! That's awesome.
-Yes.

29:50.790 --> 29:53.168
Seriously? And Marco?

29:54.002 --> 29:57.380
Apparently, Cocó thinks
that Laura isn't connecting with Marco,

29:57.464 --> 29:59.716
-so she thought maybe I could…
-That's impossible.

29:59.799 --> 30:02.344
Marco and Laura have more chemistry than--

30:02.427 --> 30:04.262
-What?
-What-- Than--

30:04.346 --> 30:06.556
[both laughing]

30:06.639 --> 30:09.684
What's up?
The writer has run out of analogies, huh?

30:09.768 --> 30:10.977
So strange.

30:11.061 --> 30:13.605
-I don't know. It's what your mom thinks.
-Mmm.

30:14.939 --> 30:16.149
[chuckles]

30:18.735 --> 30:21.738
I don't know what I'm going to do
when we go on tour.

30:21.821 --> 30:23.490
We'll be apart for months.

30:23.573 --> 30:26.368
We'll write every day.

30:26.451 --> 30:32.165
Plus, I would love to get a postcard
from every city you visit.

30:33.500 --> 30:35.085
I know, but…

30:36.586 --> 30:39.214
-I don't want to lose you.
-You won't lose me.

30:39.297 --> 30:41.966
I'm not looking to replace you.

30:45.053 --> 30:46.888
What if you came on tour with us?

30:48.264 --> 30:50.600
You know what happened today? [chuckles]

30:50.684 --> 30:53.645
Today when I was performing Adam,
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

30:54.604 --> 30:56.356
And how incredible it would've been

30:56.439 --> 30:58.817
if you were Ellie,
and we could perform this play together.

30:59.651 --> 31:02.946
Diego,
you know I have the literary workshop.

31:03.029 --> 31:04.072
I can't go.

31:04.155 --> 31:08.159
I know. I know, but-- I don't know.

31:08.243 --> 31:12.205
Maybe you can keep writing and go to
the literary workshop when you get back.

31:12.706 --> 31:16.334
No. I can't.
And what's more, I don't want to.

31:16.418 --> 31:19.129
Think about it for a second.
Just for a second.

31:20.338 --> 31:23.383
Imagine how great it would be for us
to travel together,

31:23.466 --> 31:28.096
and go to all those cities,
all those landscapes.

31:28.179 --> 31:29.764
You and I, huh?

31:30.515 --> 31:31.516
No.

31:31.599 --> 31:32.684
What's wrong?

31:35.270 --> 31:36.980
It can't be. No.

31:38.064 --> 31:39.065
What?

31:40.275 --> 31:41.526
My mom sent you.

31:48.450 --> 31:49.701
Get out.

31:49.784 --> 31:52.495
No. Listen to me. It's not what you--

31:52.579 --> 31:53.621
Get out!

31:59.044 --> 32:00.378
[sighs]

32:09.137 --> 32:12.182
[door opens, shuts]

32:12.265 --> 32:15.018
[Allegra] Do you know
what the worst thing about 1994 is?

32:15.101 --> 32:16.269
The Internet connection?

32:17.479 --> 32:18.480
No.

32:19.105 --> 32:22.442
The worst thing about 1994
is that you're not there, Félix.

32:25.111 --> 32:27.364
I can't imagine a day without you.

32:28.656 --> 32:32.118
I know I screwed everything up,
but I don't want to lose you.

32:32.202 --> 32:33.870
I don't want to lose you either,

32:33.953 --> 32:37.207
but I have to think about myself too,
right?

32:37.916 --> 32:39.000
Yeah, you're right.

32:39.876 --> 32:41.127
I was really selfish.

32:41.878 --> 32:44.589
If there's anything I can do
to help you with your short-- anything--

32:44.673 --> 32:47.175
Yes, something not too specific because…

32:47.258 --> 32:49.928
[pop] …you could disappear at any moment.

32:50.011 --> 32:51.012
You're right.

32:51.096 --> 32:54.057
But I can help you.

32:55.975 --> 32:58.687
I was thinking about trying to find Dante.

32:58.770 --> 33:00.021
What do you think?

33:01.022 --> 33:03.733
-Yes. Yes, that would be amazing.
-Yeah?

33:03.817 --> 33:05.944
Thank you. You're the best.

33:08.863 --> 33:11.157
[both clear throats]

33:11.241 --> 33:15.829
I think Greta had something to do
with what happened on opening night.

33:16.413 --> 33:17.414
Why?

33:18.289 --> 33:21.126
Because she threatened me and Marco.

33:22.085 --> 33:23.712
I still have to talk to her.

33:24.754 --> 33:27.549
Yes, but you don't know
when you'll travel again.

33:32.220 --> 33:34.556
If I can't speak to past Greta,

33:36.057 --> 33:38.143
maybe I can speak to present Greta.

33:39.936 --> 33:41.938
Do you know how to make a website?

33:42.939 --> 33:43.940
[sighs]

33:44.024 --> 33:47.318
Well, the site will have interviews
with those in leading roles

33:47.402 --> 33:51.364
and with the most important figures
in musical theater, like you, obviously.

33:51.448 --> 33:55.535
There will also be information about
upcoming productions and auditions.

33:55.618 --> 33:59.956
How great. Well, musical theater needed
a marketing space like this.

34:00.040 --> 34:02.042
-Congratulations.
-Well, thank you very much.

34:02.125 --> 34:05.211
It is very important for us
to have you on board for the site launch.

34:05.295 --> 34:06.921
[over speaker] So once again, thank you.

34:07.005 --> 34:09.090
I know you're very busy.
Should we get started?

34:09.174 --> 34:11.259
-Yes. Yes, of course.
-Yes? Okay. Good.

34:11.343 --> 34:13.053
I'll start recording. There we go.

34:13.136 --> 34:15.764
Okay. Right now, auditions are being held

34:15.847 --> 34:19.392
for Eleven O'Clock's upcoming production
of <i>Freaky Friday</i>,

34:19.476 --> 34:22.812
the show where you made your name
in musical theater.

34:22.896 --> 34:25.106
Yes, it's very exciting for me

34:25.190 --> 34:28.860
to participate
in a show that made me so happy.

34:28.943 --> 34:30.862
So I am now playing the part of Katherine.

34:30.945 --> 34:33.907
-[chuckles] Yes.
-Cocó also played Ellie and Katherine.

34:33.990 --> 34:35.283
Make her talk about Cocó.

34:35.367 --> 34:38.620
[Félix] Well, like Cocó Sharp,
you played Ellie,

34:38.703 --> 34:40.830
and now you'll play Katherine.

34:40.914 --> 34:44.084
Cocó Sharp was also the founder
and director of the company,

34:44.167 --> 34:45.543
a position you now hold.

34:46.419 --> 34:52.717
Yes, and we have distinct visions
for Eleven O'Clock.

34:52.801 --> 34:55.804
[Félix] What do you mean?
How are you different from Cocó Sharp?

34:55.887 --> 34:58.098
[Greta] I would prefer to speak
about what we have in common

34:58.181 --> 34:59.224
rather than how we differ.

34:59.307 --> 35:02.894
Anyway, we're both
musical theater stars now, right?

35:02.977 --> 35:04.896
[Félix] Totally. Totally.

35:06.106 --> 35:08.400
From what I can see,
you're not going to give up.

35:08.483 --> 35:09.484
Never.

35:10.402 --> 35:13.405
I'm not only offering you
a very good deal financially.

35:13.488 --> 35:14.989
I'm also opening doors for you

35:15.073 --> 35:17.075
at the most important theaters
in the world.

35:17.158 --> 35:18.660
After opening day,

35:18.743 --> 35:22.080
we have a months-long tour
scheduled around all of Europe.

35:22.163 --> 35:25.458
Well, exactly, around Europe.
I'm talking about the whole world.

35:26.418 --> 35:27.877
And when you finish the tour,

35:27.961 --> 35:31.256
you can come back with the company
and settle into my new theater.

35:31.339 --> 35:32.924
The show rights are yours.

35:33.842 --> 35:36.970
It's hard for me to make a decision
like this right now

35:37.053 --> 35:38.638
just before opening day, and--

35:39.389 --> 35:42.600
-I have a relationship with Tomás--
-No, no, no. Yes, yes, of course.

35:42.684 --> 35:47.480
But I think you need to put your emotions
aside and take the leap.

35:47.564 --> 35:49.941
Think about what's best for the show.
Period.

35:50.608 --> 35:53.236
But think about it
and promise you'll call me.

35:53.319 --> 35:55.280
-I promise.
-It doesn't matter what time.

35:57.490 --> 35:58.491
Good night.

36:00.952 --> 36:03.538
Hello. How are you? Doing well?

36:07.125 --> 36:08.418
What was Mike doing here?

36:10.420 --> 36:13.340
Cocó Sharp gave you the part of Ellie
that made you famous.

36:13.423 --> 36:15.967
-Would you say she was your mentor?
-[scoffs]

36:16.051 --> 36:19.137
Cocó didn't give me anything.
I earned that part.

36:19.846 --> 36:23.099
But we can't deny that she played
a fundamental role in your career.

36:23.183 --> 36:24.642
[Allegra] Ask her about the fire.

36:24.726 --> 36:28.188
Especially after the tragic events
that occurred on opening night.

36:28.271 --> 36:30.106
That night changed your life.

36:32.442 --> 36:33.818
It changed everyone's.

36:34.611 --> 36:38.656
And what happened
after the theater was destroyed?

36:39.157 --> 36:43.286
Well, Tomás Diz was not able
to produce the show,

36:43.370 --> 36:45.747
and Mike Conte managed the tour.

36:45.830 --> 36:50.085
Now, what do you think happened
on opening night?

36:53.254 --> 36:56.675
I would prefer not to delve
into that subject.

36:57.634 --> 37:00.762
-I have painful memories of that night.
-What memories?

37:01.388 --> 37:02.889
What memories? Hmm?

37:02.972 --> 37:06.142
Why do you get so nervous
when you talk about that night?

37:07.352 --> 37:11.106
I don't know what you're insinuating,
but I had nothing to do with it.

37:12.107 --> 37:14.150
With what? What happened that night?

37:15.026 --> 37:18.071
No. The interview is over. Please.

37:18.154 --> 37:20.532
-No, get her to talk about Marco.
-I don't believe you.

37:20.615 --> 37:22.867
-What did you do to Marco?
-What? Nothing!

37:24.285 --> 37:28.915
I adored Marco.
It was that girl Laura's fault.

37:28.998 --> 37:31.001
-If she hadn't been there…
-Laura?

37:31.084 --> 37:33.837
-That night Laura was with Marco.
-And what happened?

37:33.920 --> 37:36.256
-And what happened?
-I'm going to ask you to leave.

37:36.339 --> 37:37.757
Don't leave. Get her to talk about Laura.

37:37.841 --> 37:40.301
-What happened with that girl?
-Don't you realize I don't want to talk?

37:40.385 --> 37:41.678
-What happened?
-What happened?

37:41.761 --> 37:43.221
That night, Laura died.

37:43.304 --> 37:44.472
[gasps]

37:44.556 --> 37:46.391
[static over earpiece]
