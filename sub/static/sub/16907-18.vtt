00:02.169 --> 00:03.466
Previously on Arrow...

00:03.629 --> 00:04.926
You kill because you like it.

00:05.088 --> 00:06.590
That's not true, Anatoly.

00:06.757 --> 00:08.134
Someday it's going to fall apart.

00:08.300 --> 00:11.429
<i>And when it does, you're not going to
like the man you see underneath.</i>

00:11.595 --> 00:13.313
- Don't have to do this.
- Yes, I do.

00:13.972 --> 00:15.440
<i>It helped me discover who I am.</i>

00:15.599 --> 00:17.772
That's what I'm going to
help you do, Oliver.

00:17.935 --> 00:20.939
You don't kill because you have to.
So, why...

00:21.104 --> 00:22.822
I wanted to!

00:22.981 --> 00:24.858
And I liked it!

00:25.776 --> 00:27.744
We're gonna get this son of a bitch
for whatever he did to you.

00:27.903 --> 00:29.655
I don't wanna do this anymore.

00:29.821 --> 00:31.448
I'm shutting everything down.

00:42.459 --> 00:43.802
Oliver, what happened?

00:43.961 --> 00:46.305
Yeah, and what did you mean
by "shutting this all down"?

00:46.463 --> 00:50.468
Oliver, I really think that you should be
checked out by an actual doctor.

00:50.634 --> 00:55.310
The only thing I need is
for all of you to go home.

00:57.641 --> 00:59.143
Oliver, we're not going anywhere.

00:59.309 --> 01:00.481
Not a suggestion, John.

01:01.812 --> 01:04.656
Don't you think
you at least owe us an explanation?

01:05.357 --> 01:07.405
The explanation is simple.

01:08.485 --> 01:09.532
Chase is right.

01:10.153 --> 01:14.329
Everyone that is down here, around me,

01:15.993 --> 01:17.666
well, they either suffer or they die.

01:17.828 --> 01:20.456
Oliver, I can't imagine
what you've just been put through,

01:20.622 --> 01:23.000
but you have to know that Chase is wrong.

01:23.166 --> 01:26.010
I don't think that he is and I can't...

01:30.424 --> 01:32.472
Would you just go, please?

01:35.012 --> 01:38.937
Can the two of you give us the room?

01:54.615 --> 01:56.242
It's just you and me now, Oliver.

01:56.408 --> 01:58.752
Now, you don't have to
talk to me if you don't want to,

01:58.910 --> 02:00.537
but I don't think you should be alone.

02:00.704 --> 02:02.547
I think I should.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.215
John, I want you to leave.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.562
<i>RENE". He said all that?</i>

02:24.728 --> 02:28.107
I've never seen him so broken.
And I've seen him at his lowest.

02:28.273 --> 02:29.570
Did he say what Chase did to him?

02:29.733 --> 02:30.734
Nope. Don't wanna know!

02:30.901 --> 02:32.323
I already have
more than enough nightmare fuel

02:32.486 --> 02:33.988
from this job to last me a while. So...

02:34.154 --> 02:36.327
Let's back up a second.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.993
He said the team's over?

02:39.159 --> 02:42.584
Like, we're supposed to just sit back
and let Chase run wild?

02:42.746 --> 02:44.589
Nobody's sitting around, Rene.

02:44.748 --> 02:47.376
Look, Oliver's in a bad place right now,
but he will get it together.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.465
I don't have to remind any of you
how strong he is.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.130
- What did Thea say?
- She agreed.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.765
He just needs time to get his head right.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.892
She said she'll contact him
once we update her.

02:56.051 --> 02:58.349
I don't know,
this time it just seems different.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.981
He will bounce back, Felicity. He will.

03:01.139 --> 03:04.564
Until then,
we are this city's last line of defense.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.774
'Cept, our gear is back at the bunker.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.110
And Oliver reprogrammed
all the security protocols.

03:09.272 --> 03:10.694
Lyla will loan us gear from A.R.G.U.S.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.450
And what about Chase?
He's still out there.

03:12.609 --> 03:13.952
<i>We just have to remain alert.</i>

03:14.111 --> 03:16.455
We're not just the anti-Prometheus team.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.456
There are a lot of people in this city
who need saving.

03:18.615 --> 03:19.958
I'm on Chase.

03:20.117 --> 03:21.619
You guys just focus on
protecting the city.

03:22.744 --> 03:26.294
Feel free to use my apartment
as your new secret lair.

03:26.998 --> 03:28.170
Where is she going?

03:28.959 --> 03:30.461
No place good.

03:34.548 --> 03:39.145
Well, City Council bought my story
about your spiritual retreat.

03:39.302 --> 03:42.772
It turns out Councilwoman Pollard
is a big fan of all that stuff.

03:42.931 --> 03:45.150
You know, the woo-woo zen stuff.

03:45.767 --> 03:49.772
Look, I'm not asking
what he did to you, all right?

03:51.815 --> 03:53.817
All I gotta know is
what we're gonna do to him.

03:53.984 --> 03:57.329
I mean, nothing. It's over.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.330
Well, how'd you figure that?

03:59.489 --> 04:01.241
Chase doesn't give up easy.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.410
He doesn't need to do anything.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.204
He's already won.

04:05.620 --> 04:08.669
Mr. Mayor, your 11:00 is here.

04:12.919 --> 04:17.720
Thank you for your compassion in
granting me bereavement leave, Mr. Mayor.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.427
Doris' death has been very difficult.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.346
Yeah, well maybe you shouldn't have
killed her then.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.606
I'd like to speak to the Mayor
in private, please.

04:24.765 --> 04:25.766
It's not gonna happen.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.310
Quentin, please, just...

04:34.691 --> 04:36.693
What are you doing here?

04:37.903 --> 04:39.621
You won. It's over.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.874
What did I ever say
that gave you that impression?

04:49.372 --> 04:50.715
What are you doing?

04:50.874 --> 04:53.878
Proving a point. Soto speak.

04:55.086 --> 04:58.841
You think I'm gonna stab
the district attorney

04:59.007 --> 05:00.304
in the middle of City Hall?

05:00.467 --> 05:02.060
You're an animal who enjoys murder.

05:02.219 --> 05:03.516
There's no telling what you'll do.

05:03.678 --> 05:07.023
And it's not like
your alter ego can kill me,

05:07.182 --> 05:09.560
not since the SCPD
put me in protective custody

05:09.726 --> 05:12.320
since the Green Arrow slaughtered my wife.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.981
So, you kill me in broad daylight,

05:15.148 --> 05:18.903
or you let me live
knowing that there's nothing you can do.

05:27.494 --> 05:28.996
Disappointing.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.420
You can keep that knife.

05:43.677 --> 05:47.978
Idea of returning to Lian Yu
makes me weep like tiny baby,

05:48.139 --> 05:50.267
but Oliver Queen, he plan vacation there!

05:50.433 --> 05:52.310
It's not a vacation, Anatoly.

05:52.477 --> 05:54.479
People are gonna wanna know
where I've been

05:54.646 --> 05:56.774
for the past, nearly, five years.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.692
Lian Yu is the simplest answer.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.782
It's good to see you
thinking about the future.

06:00.944 --> 06:03.322
Only wish I had more time to spend
with this Oliver Queen.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.956
You have 48 hours.

06:05.115 --> 06:06.992
I know just how to spend them.

06:07.158 --> 06:11.959
In old days, Bratva used to work
on behalf of Russian people.

06:12.122 --> 06:15.547
Then selfish leaders like Gregor
corrupted our cause.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.633
So the new Pakhan wants to bring
the Bratva back to its roots.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.468
And new Pakhan needs your help.

06:21.298 --> 06:24.051
I fear I cannot rebuild brotherhood
without you, Oliver.

06:24.593 --> 06:27.972
Like I said, you have 48 hours.

06:32.517 --> 06:33.643
Hey, I finished that worm.

06:33.810 --> 06:34.811
I would've been a lot faster

06:34.978 --> 06:37.276
if I knew what kind of system I was
embedding a backdoor into but...

06:37.439 --> 06:38.440
Your timing is perfect.

06:38.607 --> 06:39.608
I just finished the compilation.

06:39.774 --> 06:43.654
This is all that we found on your target
from all available video sources,

06:43.820 --> 06:46.039
cell phones, traffic cams,
security footage...

06:46.197 --> 06:48.825
Please promise me you're never gonna make
a Felicity version of this.

06:48.992 --> 06:51.666
The world doesn't need to know
how often I'm at the wine shop.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.707
I guess it's too much to hope that
Chase took off his mask on camera.

06:54.873 --> 06:55.874
Actually he did.

06:56.041 --> 06:58.840
Yeah, I figured he wouldn't. Wait, what?

07:00.754 --> 07:02.256
Why is his face all pixelated?

07:02.422 --> 07:03.924
We're assuming
the use of optic scrambling.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.092
He's got tech that prevents
a camera from capturing his image?

07:06.259 --> 07:09.684
Like those scarves that celebrities use
to frustrate paparazzi.

07:09.846 --> 07:10.893
But here's the thing.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.524
If he's using a piece of tech

07:12.682 --> 07:14.901
- we can reverse-engineer it.
- We can reverse-engineer it.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.734
If we can produce video
that Chase is Prometheus,

07:17.896 --> 07:19.022
that's game over for him.

07:19.189 --> 07:20.190
Let's get started.

07:25.612 --> 07:26.659
<i>He'!-</i>

07:28.114 --> 07:29.787
They told me you were back.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.623
- I had to see you.
- Hey.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.163
Oh, I'm so sorry.

07:34.329 --> 07:36.377
This wasn't you, Oliver. It was him.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.917
Well, I... I created him.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.214
And I know that that might sound weird,

07:44.464 --> 07:46.387
but, uh, this happened to you
because of me.

07:46.549 --> 07:49.553
Don't let him do this to you.
Don't let that bastard inside your head.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.517
Okay.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.565
I gave the police a statement about him.

07:57.727 --> 08:03.200
They didn't believe you because
he probably had an ironclad alibi, right?

08:03.358 --> 08:05.531
Yes, but if you corroborate my statement...

08:05.694 --> 08:06.741
I can't.

08:06.903 --> 08:09.247
I know it would probably mean
outing yourself as the Green Arrow...

08:09.406 --> 08:10.623
It has nothing to do with that.

08:10.782 --> 08:13.877
It has to do with the fact that
Chase would have planned for that

08:14.035 --> 08:16.083
just like he has planned
for everything else.

08:16.246 --> 08:20.626
My only chance is, well, I have to
do something that he hasn't planned for.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.510
Like what?

08:25.255 --> 08:27.599
Listen, Susan, I know that

08:29.342 --> 08:31.765
we never got a chance to resolve things.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.225
I can't be with you.
My apologies if that's presumptuous.

08:37.392 --> 08:38.393
Oliver...

08:38.559 --> 08:40.357
This is not how...

08:43.313 --> 08:47.410
This is not how I wanted
my life to touch yours.

08:51.322 --> 08:52.995
I should've known better.

08:53.533 --> 08:57.333
And for that I really, truly am sorry.

09:12.135 --> 09:15.264
Thank you for being here
on such short notice.

09:16.806 --> 09:21.312
I understand that after last time,
I have run out of favors,

09:23.646 --> 09:26.490
but this is an impossible situation.

09:27.776 --> 09:29.995
And you're my only option.

09:36.493 --> 09:41.215
Obviously. Last time, you made very clear
you did not want Bratva in city.

09:41.372 --> 09:42.794
Circumstances have changed.

09:44.042 --> 09:46.261
I need you to kill Adrian Chase.

09:53.051 --> 09:54.177
<i>ANATOLY". Interesting.</i>

09:54.344 --> 09:57.348
I never thought
you would give up The Hood.

09:57.514 --> 10:00.893
Well, you were the one who told me
it was silly to think that a...

10:01.059 --> 10:05.690
A piece of cloth could contain
the monster inside of me forever.

10:07.357 --> 10:08.984
You were right.

10:09.359 --> 10:12.408
Such a burden, always being right.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.702
Life has no secrets.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.367
I should've listened to you back then.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.628
Least now you see self clearly.

10:19.786 --> 10:23.040
Man must know who he is
in order to be happy.

10:23.206 --> 10:25.459
Do you think I deserve to be happy?

10:25.625 --> 10:27.878
Why not? I am happy.

10:28.837 --> 10:31.386
My old friend has
finally remembered his oath,

10:31.548 --> 10:34.222
and is about to
make his brothers very rich.

10:34.384 --> 10:35.601
You should be happy, too.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.263
I just want to see
Adrian Chase in the ground.

10:38.429 --> 10:41.353
You'll be pleased to know
I've got only the best men with me.

10:41.516 --> 10:44.360
I'll get you Chase's schedule
and known locations.

10:46.646 --> 10:50.401
There is only small matter
of my down payment.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.569
There's no down payment, Anatoly.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.954
I want Chase dead immediately.

10:55.113 --> 10:59.414
After last time,
I need small gesture of goodwill.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.419
So my men can see that you are serious.

11:01.578 --> 11:03.751
It's how you Americans say,
"Let's make deal."

11:03.913 --> 11:05.631
You said that your fee has two parts, yes?

11:07.208 --> 11:09.006
I will make sure
that you acquire the first tonight.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.797
You get the second
when you take Chase out.

11:12.755 --> 11:15.804
See? I knew we could both be reasonable.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.014
Let's toast.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.100
Please tell me
you did not put away the vodka.

11:21.306 --> 11:24.685
Adrian Chase, winter is here.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.103
It's spring.

11:26.269 --> 11:29.864
We're gonna talk about you not watching
Game of Thrones, but first, look at this.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.776
The pixelation pattern was consistent
with that of an optics scrambler

11:32.942 --> 11:35.036
that Kord Industries
is planning on bringing to market

11:35.195 --> 11:36.742
- in the next six months.
- How does it work?

11:36.905 --> 11:37.952
It interferes with the camera's

11:38.114 --> 11:39.661
- digital conversion circuit.
- That's good!

11:39.824 --> 11:41.121
That means we can use an algorithm

11:41.284 --> 11:43.457
to remove the distortion
from the existing image.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.544
Yes, but to do that, I would need
physical access to Chase's scrambler.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.629
I'm sure he'd be happy to help.

11:48.791 --> 11:51.010
Sounds like a super accommodating guy.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.172
Great.

11:54.380 --> 11:57.099
I've seen more firepower
in the stands at a Dogs game.

11:57.258 --> 12:00.182
Lyla could only authorize hardware
that wouldn't be missed.

12:00.345 --> 12:01.597
Hey, have you heard from Felicity?

12:01.763 --> 12:03.686
It'd be nice for her to have
our backs when we hit the streets.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.350
Radio silence since she left for Helix,

12:05.516 --> 12:07.985
but without our comms,
I'm not sure she'd be much help.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.646
We have these.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.280
Uh...

12:14.651 --> 12:17.279
We have a break-in
at the two medical research laboratories.

12:17.445 --> 12:18.492
Let's move out.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.249
Talk to me, Curtis.

12:22.408 --> 12:23.910
<i>Without the infrared
from our body cams,</i>

12:24.077 --> 12:25.454
<i>we won't be able to pull heat signatures.</i>

12:25.620 --> 12:28.169
So we won't really know
how many hostiles we're up against.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.675
Also, this mask is
really making my face itch.

12:37.590 --> 12:41.094
Perimeter sweep is two
tangoes at the back entrance. No others.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.854
I know we don't have
our tranq ammo,

12:43.012 --> 12:46.016
but I need this done
as clean and bloodless as possible.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.684
Not a problem.

12:54.232 --> 12:57.702
I'm all for blood,
but look at the label on those crates.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.534
Oplimid. That's a diabetes drug.

13:09.664 --> 13:10.790
Back entrance is clear.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.801
Spartan and Wild Dog moving in.

13:18.881 --> 13:21.509
Hands up. Hands up. Hands up.
Hands up. Hands up.

13:21.676 --> 13:23.349
He doesn't like repeating himself.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.977
Sounds like Russian!

13:27.181 --> 13:29.104
<i>Look, this one's accent
has not improved.</i>

13:29.851 --> 13:30.943
Still sounds horrible.

13:31.102 --> 13:32.103
Anatoly?

13:32.270 --> 13:33.317
<i>John Diggle.</i>

13:33.479 --> 13:34.651
My favorite American.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.737
- We know this guy?
<i>- What</i> the <i>hell</i> are you <i>doing</i>

13:36.899 --> 13:38.526
- in Star <i>City?</i>
- Isn't it obvious?

13:40.903 --> 13:42.621
Anatoly, I can't let you
steal these drugs.

13:42.780 --> 13:43.997
Is not matter of "let."

13:44.157 --> 13:45.409
I have invitation to be here.

13:45.575 --> 13:46.918
Invitation from who?

13:50.079 --> 13:53.253
Oliver, you brought Anatoly Knyazev
to Star City?

13:53.416 --> 13:54.417
Yes. I did.

13:54.584 --> 13:58.964
And he just told me that his operation
was nearly compromised by my team.

13:59.130 --> 14:01.053
I said that's impossible.

14:01.215 --> 14:02.683
- The team no longer exists.
- The hell it doesn't!

14:02.842 --> 14:06.437
When I told you to stand down, I meant it.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.348
Anatoly is here for a reason.

14:08.514 --> 14:09.515
To steal drugs.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.435
I had to give him that
to get what I wanted.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.776
He's here to kill Adrian Chase.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.323
Oliver,

14:21.277 --> 14:27.000
we don't hire criminals,
and pay them with diabetes drugs.

14:27.158 --> 14:28.626
Chase has killed innocent people

14:28.785 --> 14:32.085
in this whole sick game
he's been playing, trying to get to me.

14:32.246 --> 14:36.126
Star City will not be safe
until he is in the ground.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.636
And there is no price I will not pay
to see that happen.

14:38.795 --> 14:41.469
- Even selling your soul?
- Better my soul than yours.

14:41.631 --> 14:45.056
Or Felicity's or Curtis'
or anyone on the team.

14:45.218 --> 14:50.975
So you got Anatoly to kill Chase
so we wouldn't have to.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.517
I created Prometheus, John.

14:52.683 --> 14:55.778
I created this whole thing.

14:55.937 --> 14:59.441
Chase's death should be on my conscience.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.200
Not yours.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.366
What the hell did Chase do to you, man,

15:04.529 --> 15:07.749
to convince you to think that
any of this is okay?

15:07.907 --> 15:09.033
This is a mistake, Oliver.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.544
A mistake that
you will not be able to come back from.

15:11.702 --> 15:12.954
And I'm not gonna let you make it.

15:13.121 --> 15:15.795
Well, I'm not gonna let you get hurt.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.256
So here we are.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.176
Felicity was right.

15:23.339 --> 15:25.387
<i>Prometheus trying to convince you that</i>

15:25.550 --> 15:28.554
you are responsible for everything bad
that's happened to people.

15:28.719 --> 15:31.313
Oliver, I swear,
that's just a bunch of crap.

15:31.472 --> 15:33.566
Tell that to Laurel.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.897
Tell that to Tommy.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.357
Tell that to my mother.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.443
Tell that to Billy Malone.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.027
I mean, you can tell it to Thea.

15:41.190 --> 15:44.569
She's so damaged
that she had to leave town.

15:44.735 --> 15:47.238
This is not post-traumatic stress, John.

15:47.405 --> 15:50.705
This is a truth that I was
keeping myself from seeing

15:50.867 --> 15:52.414
and I'm no longer doing that.

15:53.119 --> 15:56.339
Anatoly and his men
will kill Adrian Chase.

15:56.497 --> 15:57.794
That is the solution.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.545
The team is done,

16:02.837 --> 16:07.183
so I'm telling you,
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you

16:07.341 --> 16:10.561
for the last time, stand down.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.749
- I don't believe it.
- Really?

16:31.908 --> 16:34.502
I mean, Oliver can't go after Chase
himself, so he finds guys who can.

16:34.660 --> 16:37.664
He let them steal from a company
that was barely hanging on.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.332
Oliver put hundreds of jobs on the line

16:39.499 --> 16:41.968
and I know he knows that,
'cause I was in the same briefing.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.720
Yeah, speaking of which,
why haven't you gone back into City Hall?

16:44.879 --> 16:47.473
Because Lance banned him
until Chase is taken off the board.

16:47.632 --> 16:50.852
Something to do with Rene threatening
to pop a cap in his ass.

16:54.514 --> 16:57.017
What about breaking up the team?

16:57.183 --> 17:00.858
Prometheus is in Oliver's head, Curtis,
like I've never seen before.

17:01.979 --> 17:03.777
Hey, can we talk in private?

17:04.106 --> 17:06.279
Um... Yeah.

17:06.442 --> 17:07.739
Yeah.

17:24.919 --> 17:26.136
<i>He'!-</i>

17:27.255 --> 17:29.428
You and I need to
talk some sense into Oliver

17:29.590 --> 17:32.139
before he does something
that he's gonna regret.

17:32.301 --> 17:33.302
I'm not stopping you.

17:33.469 --> 17:36.063
Well, Felicity, I know you're
full throttle with this Helix,

17:36.222 --> 17:37.644
but it has to be the both of us.

17:37.807 --> 17:38.854
We have to present a united front,

17:39.016 --> 17:40.484
so we have the best chance
of getting through to him.

17:40.643 --> 17:41.815
Well, maybe we shouldn't.

17:41.978 --> 17:42.979
What do you mean?

17:43.145 --> 17:44.362
The team has been after Chase for months,

17:44.522 --> 17:45.774
and he's always been one step ahead of us.

17:45.940 --> 17:49.990
If Oliver thinks that the Bratva is
our best chance at getting to him,

17:50.152 --> 17:52.200
then maybe we should stay out of his way.

17:56.701 --> 18:00.205
And when chemicals
from both medicines bind,

18:00.371 --> 18:03.124
it creates powerful opioid.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.089
It's more addictive than heroin.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.596
It's just what the world needs.

18:09.839 --> 18:12.809
Revenue is what Bratva needs.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.638
It's gotten bad, Oliver.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.351
I'm under much pressure.

18:18.514 --> 18:22.109
This drug will help secure my position
as Pakhan.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.855
So that's why you need the medicine,

18:27.148 --> 18:28.900
to manufacture a street drug?

18:29.066 --> 18:30.363
Shouldn't be here, John.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.073
Should've known Curtis would
hack the locks, Oliver.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.991
I didn't think I could be
more disappointed, I guess I was wrong.

18:37.491 --> 18:39.209
I'll let you have room.

18:45.041 --> 18:47.385
I'm not gonna keep having
the same conversation.

18:47.543 --> 18:52.344
That's too bad 'cause I dedicated
five years of my life to your crusade.

18:52.506 --> 18:57.057
So I'm the one that gets to say
if I need protecting. Not you.

18:57.219 --> 18:59.813
I'm not gonna have your death
on my conscience.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.690
Oliver, don't talk to me
about your conscience.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.272
Not when you get back in bed
with the Bratva.

19:06.812 --> 19:07.904
This isn't you, man.

19:08.522 --> 19:11.366
<i>The Oliver I know would never let
a group of dangerous criminals</i>

19:11.525 --> 19:15.246
crawl into his city,
let them steal medicine.

19:16.405 --> 19:19.033
You don't know what kind of man I am.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.752
What?

19:21.911 --> 19:24.414
What the hell did Chase do to you, Oliver?

19:24.580 --> 19:27.834
Whatever it was, he messed with your head
in a way I didn't think was possible.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.423
Look at me, man. I can help you.

19:30.586 --> 19:31.633
I'm your brother.

19:31.796 --> 19:33.343
You don't want me as a brother.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.553
What does that mean?

19:34.715 --> 19:37.969
Chase showed me the truth about myself.

19:40.137 --> 19:44.734
You signed on for a crusade
that turned out to be an outlet.

19:45.976 --> 19:49.651
It was an excuse for me to murder people.

19:49.814 --> 19:51.691
- Oliver, please.
- I put on a hood

19:51.857 --> 19:54.280
and I created a persona because, John,

19:54.443 --> 19:58.539
somewhere along the way,
something in me broke.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.748
Something is sick inside of me.

20:02.910 --> 20:08.212
The crusade, all of this,
the foundation of it, is a lie.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.342
<i>So I disbanded the team</i>

20:10.501 --> 20:12.799
because I won't sit by

20:12.962 --> 20:18.389
and watch all of you
participate in my murder spree.

20:20.302 --> 20:22.350
I am beyond redemption.

20:22.930 --> 20:27.652
You and the team will be fine
if you stay away from me,

20:27.810 --> 20:30.814
you stay away from this,
you stay away from Chase,

20:30.980 --> 20:34.325
and you allow the Bratva to do their job.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.500
Let my crusade die.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.355
That kid won't last a month.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.561
- He had tuberculosis?
- Mmm.

21:06.724 --> 21:08.601
The disease comes from prison.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.111
Super-resistant strain.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.692
What? I mean, is it in any way treatable?

21:12.855 --> 21:14.983
Yeah, with right medicine, yes,

21:15.149 --> 21:18.744
but even Bratva cannot buy for them,
not in quantities needed.

21:18.903 --> 21:20.530
All we can do is pay for funerals.

21:20.696 --> 21:23.575
Anatoly, is this how we're planning on
spending my last two days in Russia?

21:23.741 --> 21:26.119
I thought, what better way
to cap off your time here

21:26.285 --> 21:28.879
than good old-fashioned heist?

21:36.712 --> 21:41.058
If Diggle's the new Oliver, and I'm
obviously the new Felicity, don't hate,

21:41.217 --> 21:43.015
which one of you guys is the new Diggle?

21:43.177 --> 21:44.645
- I am.
- I am.

21:45.721 --> 21:48.770
Seriously? You've been here,
like, what, 10 minutes?

21:48.933 --> 21:50.651
You don't even have a codename!

21:50.810 --> 21:53.313
Fine. You're the new Digg.

21:55.898 --> 21:58.071
The fact that she was not petty and...

21:58.234 --> 22:00.077
I mean, that's extremely Digg-like.

22:00.236 --> 22:02.204
- You see that, right? She's...
- Yeah, okay, you're the new Digg.

22:03.405 --> 22:05.328
But as the only Rene Ramirez,

22:05.491 --> 22:06.583
- I gotta ask...
- Oh, boy.

22:06.742 --> 22:09.666
Shouldn't we be cool with
letting the Bratva kill Adrian Chase?

22:09.829 --> 22:11.422
No, we shouldn't.

22:11.580 --> 22:14.709
Look, guys,
if Oliver lets the Bratva kill Chase,

22:14.875 --> 22:16.593
he's just going right back
into his old habits.

22:16.752 --> 22:18.425
And he's willing to
make that sacrifice right now,

22:18.587 --> 22:20.760
but, I think,
once Oliver's thinking clearly,

22:20.923 --> 22:22.516
he's gonna regret this.

22:22.675 --> 22:25.645
So we're just supposed to let Chase
live to kill another day?

22:25.803 --> 22:28.101
No, we're gonna bring Chase to justice.
The right way.

22:28.430 --> 22:32.105
This isn't about saving Chase,
it's about saving Oliver's soul.

22:36.438 --> 22:40.488
Curtis, the hack you put on the DA's
office just pulled up Chase's schedule.

22:40.651 --> 22:42.779
He's about to leave City Hall.

22:42.945 --> 22:45.073
Trip to the safe house
SCPD's keeping Chase in

22:45.239 --> 22:47.458
is the perfect time
for the Russians to do their thing.

22:47.616 --> 22:48.617
Can't let the Bratva get a hold of Chase.

22:48.784 --> 22:49.785
I can pull up his route remotely.

22:49.952 --> 22:51.124
<i>And I saw something on Felicity's computer</i>

22:51.287 --> 22:52.288
<i>that might help us get Chase.</i>

22:52.454 --> 22:53.922
Good. Do that. Let's suit up.

22:54.081 --> 22:56.379
"Suit up"? Wait, we don't have suits...

22:56.542 --> 22:58.670
You meant figuratively. Suit up...

22:58.836 --> 23:00.008
Suit up, like...

23:00.170 --> 23:02.764
We're still in the lair, suit up, like,
but we're not in the lair.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.300
But did you see what I'm saying?

23:09.221 --> 23:10.438
Quite an escort.

23:11.515 --> 23:13.313
Green Arrow could be anywhere.

23:13.475 --> 23:14.647
Who do you think is under that hood?

23:14.810 --> 23:16.733
The department has gotta have a theory.

23:19.523 --> 23:20.820
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

23:22.067 --> 23:23.660
Make sure that Kevlar stays on.

24:00.856 --> 24:02.779
Go! Run!

24:06.904 --> 24:09.032
Hey! Why interfere?

24:09.198 --> 24:10.700
You want Chase dead, yes?

24:10.866 --> 24:12.868
Yes, but not like this.

24:18.916 --> 24:20.213
Mr. Holt.

24:23.754 --> 24:25.381
How's that husband of yours?

24:29.718 --> 24:31.095
Mr. Chase!
- I'm over here!

24:31.720 --> 24:34.223
- Mr. Chase!
- I'm over here!

24:34.431 --> 24:37.184
The hitters are retreating.
Are you all right?

24:37.351 --> 24:39.820
I'm fine. I'm fine.

24:45.067 --> 24:46.740
- Rene and Diggle?
- Driving off Anatoly's men.

24:46.902 --> 24:48.700
Did you get it?

24:50.823 --> 24:51.915
I got it.

24:52.074 --> 24:53.075
Good man.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.384
It's clear the attack occurred

25:02.543 --> 25:05.046
after details of the DA's schedule
were compromised.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.213
A leak?

25:06.380 --> 25:07.677
<i>AGENT". Until we can confirm the source,</i>

25:07.840 --> 25:10.719
<i>DA Chase will be transferred into
the Federal Witness Protection Program.</i>

25:10.884 --> 25:12.932
No Star City employee
will have access to his file.

25:13.095 --> 25:15.769
I'm really not sure
all of this is necessary.

25:15.931 --> 25:20.528
Adrian, please, your safety is of
paramount importance to this office.

25:24.565 --> 25:25.566
Do it.

25:28.986 --> 25:30.829
You actually tried something.

25:30.988 --> 25:32.581
Consider me impressed.

25:34.241 --> 25:35.868
This isn't over.

25:46.879 --> 25:49.598
Chase is being transferred into
federal protection,

25:49.757 --> 25:51.680
which means that
the Bratva can't get to him.

25:51.842 --> 25:52.843
You're welcome.

25:57.848 --> 25:59.316
Feel better?

25:59.933 --> 26:00.980
No.

26:01.935 --> 26:03.812
We're not done, Oliver.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.903
You and me, we're never gonna be done.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.534
Do you understand that?

26:08.692 --> 26:11.912
Listen, man, you can tell me
that you're a serial killer,

26:12.071 --> 26:16.497
that you're crazy or you're whatever
Chase has shoved into your head,

26:16.658 --> 26:19.002
but I'm not believing any of that,
even if you do.

26:19.161 --> 26:21.710
And that's because
I know the kind of man you are, Oliver.

26:21.872 --> 26:23.624
The good, the bad, and the ugly.

26:23.791 --> 26:25.043
I know.

26:26.085 --> 26:30.807
And you don't need to punish yourself
or isolate yourself,

26:31.006 --> 26:35.011
but what you need to do
is stop pushing me away

26:35.177 --> 26:37.726
because I'm not going anywhere, Oliver!

26:37.888 --> 26:38.980
Do you get that?

26:39.139 --> 26:41.608
What do you want me to do, John?

26:43.185 --> 26:46.109
I've told you what I am, who I am,

26:46.271 --> 26:49.150
and even if you don't believe it, I do.

26:51.401 --> 26:52.527
I do.

26:55.239 --> 26:58.118
So I don't know where that leaves us.

27:07.417 --> 27:09.715
It leaves us right back
at Langham, Oliver.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.922
You remember that?

27:13.715 --> 27:16.264
It killed my brother, Oliver,

27:17.761 --> 27:21.857
and I was going to let myself
rot in prison for what I did.

27:24.059 --> 27:26.903
But you told me to atone
for what I did as Spartan.

27:27.062 --> 27:31.568
<i>And if that's true for me,
it is 100 times truer for the Green Arrow.</i>

27:31.733 --> 27:35.408
You don't get to
just walk away from this, man.

27:36.071 --> 27:37.994
The Hood is who you are.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.080
You don't think you deserve it? Fine.

27:40.576 --> 27:42.874
Work to become the man who does.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.248
I don't know how.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.428
You just ask for help.

27:53.338 --> 27:55.761
You don't have to do this alone, Oliver.

27:59.386 --> 28:01.104
I have an idea.

28:01.263 --> 28:02.560
We hack WITSEC.

28:02.723 --> 28:04.441
Can we find out
what town Chase is going into,

28:04.600 --> 28:07.774
and then we get hired as waitresses
at the inevitably folksy diner,

28:07.936 --> 28:10.610
we drug his coffee,
we steal his scrambler.

28:10.772 --> 28:12.570
Mmm. You know how I know I'm exhausted?

28:12.733 --> 28:14.451
That plan actually sounds plausible.

28:14.610 --> 28:15.987
Free pie. For life.

28:16.153 --> 28:17.575
- That's all I'm saying. Free pie.
- Mmm-hmm.

28:17.738 --> 28:18.830
- Felicity.
- Yeah.

28:18.989 --> 28:20.115
Do you know this guy?

28:20.282 --> 28:21.283
Curtis?

28:21.450 --> 28:23.043
- You told him about our operation?
- No.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.708
I turn off the GPS on my phone.
How did you...

28:26.622 --> 28:28.465
You son of a bitch. Those damn...

28:28.624 --> 28:32.379
Tracking nanites, yup. Blueberries weren't
the only surprise in those pancakes.

28:32.544 --> 28:33.636
I knew they were funky.

28:33.795 --> 28:34.796
Um, can we talk in private?

28:34.963 --> 28:36.715
- Uh, no.
- Fine.

28:36.882 --> 28:39.510
Then you don't get to ask me
any questions about how I got this.

28:39.676 --> 28:42.145
- Is that...
- Chase's optics scrambler? Sure is.

28:42.304 --> 28:43.351
How did you know we were looking for it?

28:43.513 --> 28:45.811
I might've taken a peek
at your IRC window.

28:45.974 --> 28:49.319
I guess you can say
that I hacked the hackers. Wow!

28:54.066 --> 28:55.613
- What?
- The pixelation algorithm, is encrypted,

28:55.776 --> 28:57.995
I should've known it would be encrypted,
but it's encrypted.

28:58.153 --> 28:59.996
Well, how long will it take you
to break the encryption?

29:00.155 --> 29:02.578
If my math is right. 3.6, 10 to the 18th,

29:02.741 --> 29:06.211
e to the six, seventy-five turf locks,
13 months.

29:06.370 --> 29:08.168
Well, I know someone
who can break it faster.

29:08.330 --> 29:09.798
Kord Industries.

29:09.957 --> 29:11.755
I mean, they set the encryption,
they can break it.

29:11.917 --> 29:15.342
I don't think that Kord
is gonna help us hack their stolen tech.

29:15.504 --> 29:17.097
And that's why you'll have to break in.

29:17.839 --> 29:20.183
Shouldn't be so hard
for Overwatch and Mr. Terrific,

29:20.342 --> 29:21.844
who could pull off a heist at Kord.

29:22.010 --> 29:24.513
You told them about our operation?

29:24.680 --> 29:26.808
- I didn't. How did you...
- Come on, Felicity,

29:26.974 --> 29:28.066
you really think we didn't know?

29:28.225 --> 29:29.602
It took me eight minutes,
three for this guy.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.020
These hackers are mean.

29:31.186 --> 29:32.563
Well, deal with it.

29:32.729 --> 29:34.697
We have to deal with this.

29:38.986 --> 29:40.454
Thanks for meeting.

29:42.823 --> 29:44.416
I am only here for you to explain

29:44.574 --> 29:47.794
why team you disbanded
keeps interfering with business.

29:47.953 --> 29:51.082
Because they don't give up,

29:51.248 --> 29:52.545
and they convinced me not to.

29:54.418 --> 29:57.888
Anatoly, I'm sorry, but you need to
tell your men to stand down.

29:58.046 --> 29:59.047
Our deal is off.

29:59.756 --> 30:00.757
No.

30:00.924 --> 30:02.141
Excuse me?

30:02.301 --> 30:05.896
You want Chase to keep breathing, fine,

30:06.054 --> 30:09.183
but I'm not leaving Star City
until I get what I came for.

30:09.349 --> 30:13.024
You know as well as I do,
once there is deal, it is forever.

30:13.186 --> 30:15.234
I understand how the Bratva works. I...

30:15.397 --> 30:17.115
lam asking you this as a friend.

30:17.274 --> 30:19.368
Yes. And I am telling, as friend,

30:19.526 --> 30:22.370
if you interfere with my operation,

30:22.529 --> 30:26.033
no favor exists that can repair break
between you and I.

30:26.908 --> 30:30.503
You either Bratva brother,
or you Bratva enemy.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.638
We are in position.

30:40.797 --> 30:42.925
<i>I'll meet you by the side entrance.</i>

31:07.074 --> 31:09.998
The Bratva aren't backing down,

31:10.160 --> 31:12.538
which means I have to stop them.

31:13.288 --> 31:16.462
John has convinced me not to do it alone.

31:18.627 --> 31:22.302
I wanted to shut all of this down
because I was afraid.

31:23.632 --> 31:26.932
I was afraid that asking you to kill Chase

31:27.094 --> 31:28.937
would corrupt you more than...

31:29.096 --> 31:30.894
More than I already have.

31:32.682 --> 31:33.979
To me, the...

31:34.142 --> 31:35.735
The Bratva was the best option,

31:35.894 --> 31:38.989
but John insists that as a team,

31:39.147 --> 31:41.900
we can find another way
to bring Chase to justice.

31:42.484 --> 31:45.863
<i>You've put your faith in me
and I'm putting my faith in you now</i>

31:46.029 --> 31:47.781
because once...

31:47.948 --> 31:50.121
Once we handle the Bratva, I'd...

31:51.410 --> 31:54.960
I need your help to prove that
John is right and Chase is wrong.

31:55.122 --> 31:58.752
Should be easy considering Prometheus
is all the way wrong, hoss.

31:58.917 --> 32:02.888
I think what Rene is trying to say is that

32:03.046 --> 32:05.674
it's not all on your shoulders.

32:05.841 --> 32:08.014
<i>We're here for you, Oliver.</i>

32:14.391 --> 32:15.517
Okay.

32:17.102 --> 32:18.354
Suit up.

32:31.825 --> 32:33.702
Alarms haven't been triggered all night.

32:33.869 --> 32:35.291
No break-ins.

32:35.454 --> 32:36.876
Yeah, except us.

32:37.038 --> 32:39.257
Anatoly needs Revlextra
to manufacture his drug.

32:39.416 --> 32:40.793
The Bratva will definitely be here.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.633
Spartan's right.
Anatoly won't back off now.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.593
They could be anywhere,
this place is huge.

32:45.755 --> 32:48.304
Felicity and Curtis
picked a hell of a night to take off.

32:56.892 --> 32:58.360
Okay, I'm in.

33:05.025 --> 33:07.244
CCTV is compromised.

33:08.069 --> 33:09.241
Got anything?

33:09.404 --> 33:11.498
West wing is clear.

33:13.450 --> 33:14.952
So's the East.

33:26.463 --> 33:28.716
I was hoping
I wouldn't have to punch anybody.

33:34.387 --> 33:36.435
All right, I just got a sentry.
They can't be far.

33:36.598 --> 33:37.690
<i>They're not.</i>

33:41.686 --> 33:44.235
Better get over here. Fast.

33:44.397 --> 33:45.398
NO.

33:49.236 --> 33:50.783
That worked.

34:07.337 --> 34:08.463
You can't win.

34:08.630 --> 34:10.974
Is that you behind mask?

34:11.132 --> 34:12.304
What happened to hood?

34:12.467 --> 34:13.969
It's over, Anatoly.

34:14.135 --> 34:15.478
Leave the medicine and go.

34:15.637 --> 34:18.389
I had feeling you would say this.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.355
So I prepared insurance plan.

34:36.824 --> 34:39.498
You have chosen
where you stand with Bratva.

34:39.661 --> 34:41.538
<i>Now you must make one more choice.</i>

34:42.371 --> 34:45.797
Save pills or save hostages?

34:46.376 --> 34:49.380
Spartan, Wild Dog, get the hostages.

34:49.545 --> 34:50.967
I'll handle the Bratva.

34:51.797 --> 34:52.844
Kill them.

35:27.292 --> 35:28.885
In Russia, you would have killed him.

35:31.171 --> 35:32.969
And you would've stopped him.

35:33.131 --> 35:36.055
Looks like we're not in Russia anymore.

35:48.396 --> 35:49.898
You all right?

35:52.317 --> 35:55.161
Curtis didn't leave us completely hanging.

36:10.794 --> 36:11.795
Hand me your tablet.

36:11.961 --> 36:13.087
You brought the scrambler here?

36:13.254 --> 36:16.098
I wasn't gonna wait to see
if we could break the encryption.

36:23.264 --> 36:25.266
Go ahead, Oliver.

36:25.767 --> 36:27.519
You want to kill old life?

36:29.229 --> 36:30.572
Start by killing me.

36:35.568 --> 36:37.991
Very stupid. Now you have to run.

36:38.154 --> 36:39.201
So do you.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.679
- Did you get it?
- Oh, yeah.

37:05.765 --> 37:06.766
<i>That is what we needed.</i>

37:06.933 --> 37:08.981
Something that he couldn't plan for.

37:09.644 --> 37:10.645
You.

37:11.688 --> 37:13.816
Please let me be the one
to walk this into SCPD.

37:13.982 --> 37:14.983
Knock yourself out.

37:15.150 --> 37:16.527
Yeah, and then I'm gonna
throw it up on YouTube.

37:16.693 --> 37:18.445
There won't be anywhere
that son of a bitch can run.

37:18.611 --> 37:20.534
Does this mean that
we're officially back in business?

37:25.034 --> 37:28.629
Aside from a few minor changes, yeah.

37:35.211 --> 37:37.464
New lineup could use
a little more green, hoss.

37:37.630 --> 37:39.632
I'm not quite there yet.

37:40.508 --> 37:43.682
I'm thinking that
with this team behind me,

37:43.845 --> 37:45.518
it'll be sooner rather than later.

37:55.106 --> 37:56.699
How does it feel to be Robin Hood?

37:56.858 --> 37:59.361
Hmm, you tell me.
You're the one with bow and arrow.

37:59.527 --> 38:02.531
I know I said that
Russia's not good for you...

38:02.697 --> 38:06.201
But you thought that this heist,
and helping these people

38:06.367 --> 38:08.495
would convince me
to change my mind about leaving.

38:08.870 --> 38:10.964
<i>Da.</i> Like I said, I need your help.

38:11.122 --> 38:13.295
Russia is your home, Anatoly.

38:13.458 --> 38:15.381
Let me go save mine.

38:15.543 --> 38:16.886
You can do this without me.

38:17.045 --> 38:19.639
I'm not worried about
what Bratva would become without you.

38:21.257 --> 38:23.510
I worry about what I become.

38:25.553 --> 38:27.055
But more important question,

38:27.222 --> 38:31.102
how drunk can we get
before dropping you off at Lian Yu?

38:35.897 --> 38:37.695
You have two minutes.

38:37.857 --> 38:39.575
Then I'm calling the SCPD.

38:39.734 --> 38:42.658
Oliver Queen, afraid to be alone
with Bratva gangster?

38:42.821 --> 38:43.868
How far you have fallen.

38:44.030 --> 38:46.078
Anatoly, you didn't bring me here
to insult me.

38:46.241 --> 38:47.959
No. I give you friendly tip.

38:48.117 --> 38:50.119
I go back to Russia tonight,

38:50.286 --> 38:52.835
but leave Star City a little present.

38:52.997 --> 38:54.089
My best men.

38:54.249 --> 38:55.250
Your best men were arrested.

38:55.458 --> 38:57.176
Already out on bail.

38:58.211 --> 39:01.761
I hear they cannot wait to get revenge
on vigilantes that put them away.

39:01.923 --> 39:05.973
This is between you and me, no one else.

39:06.135 --> 39:07.261
"No one else"?

39:07.428 --> 39:10.932
You betrayed every man in Bratva.

39:11.099 --> 39:13.318
You betrayed Russian community.

39:13.476 --> 39:15.194
You even work against own team!

39:15.353 --> 39:19.324
I see this, I think,
I still trust him anyway.

39:20.316 --> 39:21.442
What a fool I was.

39:21.609 --> 39:23.532
No. I'm the fool.

39:24.779 --> 39:28.534
Because I thought that our friendship,
everything we have been through together,

39:28.700 --> 39:30.543
actually meant something to you.

39:30.702 --> 39:33.831
The person that I knew
would never betray a friend,

39:33.997 --> 39:37.342
would never threaten innocent people.

39:37.667 --> 39:38.964
Over what?

39:40.336 --> 39:41.462
A payday-

39:42.338 --> 39:46.263
When I left Russia, I was convinced
that you could lead the Bratva,

39:46.426 --> 39:49.600
that you could set them on a better path.

39:51.306 --> 39:52.683
And now look at you.

39:54.809 --> 39:56.356
You're no better than Gregor.

39:58.813 --> 40:00.235
I told you.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.992
I was worried about what I would become
without your help.

40:04.736 --> 40:09.788
I did what I had to do
to keep Bratva together.

40:10.700 --> 40:11.997
And to stay alive.

40:12.327 --> 40:14.580
I became what I had to become.

40:14.829 --> 40:16.297
You ask why I changed?

40:16.998 --> 40:18.341
That is it.

40:26.090 --> 40:29.845
This video has been authenticated
by three different experts.

40:30.136 --> 40:33.686
It hasn't been doctored or altered
in any way. That is raw footage.

40:33.890 --> 40:36.188
Chase is in the protective custody
of the U.S. Marshals.

40:36.768 --> 40:38.111
Yeah. Well somebody better give 'em a call

40:38.269 --> 40:40.192
and place that son of a bitch
under arrest.
