Previous/)4”

00:03.670 --> 00:04.659
She was raped.

00:07.380 --> 00:08.665
It's him.

00:12.090 --> 00:13.637
You beat up the wrong man.

00:13.720 --> 00:15.381
I was defending your honour,

00:15.800 --> 00:17.927
and now I come to find
ye claim yourself vrolated

00:18.010 --> 00:19.716
upon findin' yerself wi' child...

00:20.310 --> 00:23.347
I was violated, by someone else!

00:23.600 --> 00:24.589
It was him.

00:29.190 --> 00:31.272
When you ’Ve delivered
my daughter to River Run,

00:31.700 --> 00:33.065
ﬁnd Stephen Bonnet.

00:33.410 --> 00:34.729
Bring him to me in secret

00:35.120 --> 00:36.564
Now where the hell is Roger?

00:36.660 --> 00:39.072
I sold him to the Mohawk.

00:39.700 --> 00:42.783
I will find him, lass.
I wilna rest until I do.

01:16.360 --> 01:18.191
Don't even think _
of trying to escape again.

01:20.950 --> 01:23.191
Move. We're leaving.

01:25.370 --> 01:26.416
Move!

01:33.210 --> 01:35.713
Sing me a song

01:35.800 --> 01:38.792
Ofa less that is gone

01:38.890 --> 01:41.848
Say, could that lass

01:41.930 --> 01:44.478
Be 1'?

01:44.560 --> 01:46.596
Merry of soul

01:46.690 --> 01:49.432
She salied on a day

01:49.770 --> 01:51.726
Over the sea

01:51.820 --> 01:54.641
7'0 Skye

01:54.860 --> 01:57.488
B/i/ow and breeze

01:57.570 --> 02:00.027
Islands and seas

02:00.120 --> 02:04.443
Mountains of rain and sun

02:05.330 --> 02:07.571
All that was good

02:07.670 --> 02:10.491
All that was fair

02:10.590 --> 02:13.047
All that was me

02:13.130 --> 02:15.758
Is gone

02:15.840 --> 02:17.876
Sing me a song

02:17.970 --> 02:20.791
Of a lass that is gone

02:20.890 --> 02:23.381
Say, could that lass

02:23.470 --> 02:25.722
Be 1'?

02:26.140 --> 02:28.267
Merry of soul

02:28.350 --> 02:31.353
She sa/led on a day

02:31.440 --> 02:35.228
Over the sea

02:35.320 --> 02:40.405
7'0 Skye

03:14.570 --> 03:16.026
I dinna mean to disturb ye,

03:17.030 --> 03:19.817
but I thought ye might like
a morsel of somethin' while ye're drawing.

03:22.660 --> 03:23.649
Thank you, Lizzie.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.997
Oh, God in heaven.
What have I brought ye to?

03:33.790 --> 03:36.247
Oh, monstrous darkness, ye're possessed.

03:37.010 --> 03:38.750
Lizzie, I'm not possessed.

03:39.470 --> 03:40.459
I'm...

03:41.550 --> 03:44.292
I'm hurt and angry.

03:44.510 --> 03:46.000
It's all my fault.

03:47.140 --> 03:48.129
No.

03:49.060 --> 03:50.937
You made an honest mistake.

03:51.060 --> 03:52.470
You thought you were protecting me.

03:52.850 --> 03:55.182
But I made such a mess of things.

03:56.360 --> 03:57.770
Will ye ever forgive me?

04:00.070 --> 04:01.230
Of course.

04:02.570 --> 04:03.616
It's over.

04:04.570 --> 04:06.117
We don't need to talk about it again.

04:18.500 --> 04:21.162
And what about yer father?

04:21.470 --> 04:23.085
Will ye forgive him as well?

04:23.180 --> 04:24.579
He wouldna have done what he did

04:24.680 --> 04:27.057
ifI hadna been mistaken
about Mr Wakefield.

04:27.140 --> 04:30.132
Even ifI could forgive him
for what he did to Roger,

04:30.220 --> 04:32.347
I can't forget the things he said to me.

04:36.730 --> 04:39.779
I'll leave ye to yer drawing,
then, Mistress.

05:01.420 --> 05:06.130
Ye'll have heard about the Mohawk,
no doubt, in yer time.

05:06.550 --> 05:07.847
Only in movies.

05:08.890 --> 05:10.926
The moving pictures I've told you about.

05:11.310 --> 05:13.175
I don't know much about them.

05:14.730 --> 05:17.187
Sometimes it's hard to separate
fact from fiction.

05:17.520 --> 05:20.398
When ye dinna have two sides
of the story, aye, it is.

05:24.360 --> 05:27.818
Well, the portrayals don't tend to weigh
heavily in favour of the Mohawk.

05:28.280 --> 05:31.943
If there was a moving picture
about us, about me...

05:33.580 --> 05:36.162
I'd be seen as a fearsome brute.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.206
That would be one side of the story.

05:41.630 --> 05:42.619
Uncle.

05:44.380 --> 05:45.836
Did the Cherokee recognise that?

05:45.930 --> 05:49.593
Aye, they believe it's from
a Mohawk village called Shadow Lake.

05:50.260 --> 05:52.137
There's a good chance
Roger's been taken there.

05:52.220 --> 05:53.847
Would they be willing to guide us there?

05:55.390 --> 05:57.267
It's at least two months' ride north.

05:57.350 --> 06:00.262
Did ye tell them we'll pay,
with whislq and furs?

06:00.360 --> 06:03.227
They have no business there, Uncle.
The Cherokee wilna accompany us.

06:05.900 --> 06:07.561
Then we must find our own way there.

06:10.700 --> 06:12.190
I can speak some Mohawk,

06:12.580 --> 06:14.650
and the Mohawk I sold Roger to
spoke English.

06:17.290 --> 06:20.874
We don't know what lies ahead,
and it'll be dangerous, but...

06:22.300 --> 06:23.335
Aye.

06:24.420 --> 06:26.627
Aye. We've lived wi' the fear
of the unknown before,

06:27.760 --> 06:29.830
not knowing if the other is alive or dead,

06:30.970 --> 06:32.301
but each passing day,

06:32.810 --> 06:35.017
Bree must suffer through
the very same thing.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.181
Let's be on our way, then.

07:13.930 --> 07:15.090
Auntie.

07:17.980 --> 07:19.595
Ye should go to him while we're stopped.

07:21.100 --> 07:22.101
Why?

07:22.770 --> 07:24.101
Does he need help?

07:25.150 --> 07:26.606
So ye're still angry with him, then?

07:32.070 --> 07:33.059
No.

07:34.200 --> 07:35.440
Is that what you think?

07:39.540 --> 07:40.529
Aren't ye?

07:42.130 --> 07:43.165
No.

07:50.420 --> 07:51.876
Go to him, Auntie Claire.

07:52.340 --> 07:53.887
We're going to make this right.

07:53.970 --> 07:55.289
I know, Ian.

08:00.350 --> 08:02.398
We didna mean to be reckless. We thought--

08:02.480 --> 08:05.108
I know what you thought.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.606
What you both thought.

08:10.740 --> 08:11.980
It's just...

08:13.660 --> 08:18.359
I'm finding it hard not to think about
how Brianna and Roger must feel.

08:23.250 --> 08:25.992
One day, when you've children
of your own, you'll understand.

08:28.920 --> 08:30.911
You never stop worrying about them.

08:32.380 --> 08:33.927
I dinna ken about that.

08:39.140 --> 08:41.131
I hate to see ye both sufferin' so.

08:55.870 --> 08:57.610
Crossed paths not too long ago.

08:57.700 --> 09:00.282
I reckon he'll be in Wilmington
in a week's time,

09:01.200 --> 09:03.498
but ye're wasting yer breath
if ye think Stephen Bonnet

09:03.580 --> 09:05.741
will take on a man with one hand.

09:05.830 --> 09:07.582
It's not why I'm asking...

09:31.730 --> 09:33.027
Any luck today?

09:40.160 --> 09:42.116
Still no work at the butcher's, then?

09:42.950 --> 09:45.327
'Tis usually the men
that do the butchering,

09:46.040 --> 09:48.326
rather than having been
butchered themselves.

09:53.130 --> 09:57.499
In Milord's eyes, I'm whole,
but to them, here, I'm...

09:58.180 --> 09:59.249
I'm less than a man.

09:59.970 --> 10:01.961
'Tis no work in Wilmington
for someone like me.

10:06.770 --> 10:09.762
Here's some men
who'd be better served out at work.

10:10.940 --> 10:12.896
At least ye're tryin'.

10:15.570 --> 10:17.856
They've been in there for hours.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.401
I have a mind to turn them in myself.

10:20.530 --> 10:21.519
For what crime?

10:21.620 --> 10:23.485
None of that cheek, Fergus Fraser,

10:23.580 --> 10:27.368
not when Murtagh has enlisted yer aid
in capturing a murderer.

10:32.090 --> 10:35.002
Stephen Bonnet should be
in Wilmington in a week's time.

10:35.670 --> 10:36.910
So I heard today.

10:39.590 --> 10:40.636
I dinna like it,

10:41.430 --> 10:44.718
not with all his meetings
with his Regulators.

10:45.020 --> 10:49.229
It is burden enough harbourin'
a wanted man under our roof.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.606
He would do the same for me.

11:02.370 --> 11:03.940
If it comes to that, then,

11:04.080 --> 11:05.536
aye, we must.

11:06.330 --> 11:07.649
I hope it does.

11:09.170 --> 11:10.364
Speak to Malachi.

11:11.130 --> 11:14.497
Give him the list of names _of_
all those Willing to lay down their lives.

11:19.180 --> 11:21.421
- Have ye news of Bonnet?
- Aye.

11:22.010 --> 11:23.136
Good news.

11:24.010 --> 11:25.170
Ah.

11:39.700 --> 11:42.271
We dinna have much time to get ye ready.

11:43.240 --> 11:44.320
Ready for what?

11:44.410 --> 11:46.651
Mistres_s Cameron's holdin'
a dinner next week,

11:46.740 --> 11:48.651
and I need to fit ye for a new dress.

11:49.410 --> 11:51.992
Phaedre, could you please tell my aunt
I don't need a new dress?

11:52.830 --> 11:54.582
But ye do, Mistress,

11:54.670 --> 11:57.161
and a new dress
will help hide yer condition.

11:57.460 --> 11:58.449
Hide it from whom?

11:58.550 --> 12:02.589
We've got us a lord coming to visit
from Virginia, master of Mount Josiah.

12:03.680 --> 12:08.094
Mistress Cameron wants to introduce ye
to him and some of her other friends.

12:09.350 --> 12:10.556
I don't want to meet anyone.

12:11.560 --> 12:12.936
Oh, ye dinna mean that.

12:13.690 --> 12:17.478
Ye'll soon learn that Mistress Cameron's
dinners are the talk of the county,

12:17.980 --> 12:20.528
and once ye have a new dress...

12:24.280 --> 12:26.441
Phaedre, stay there, by the window.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.577
The light, the way it hits your face...

12:31.660 --> 12:32.661
Here.

12:36.670 --> 12:38.490
What are ye doing, Miss Fraser?

12:39.420 --> 12:40.409
I'm drawing you.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.046
Why on Earth would ye do that?

12:43.510 --> 12:44.886
You're beautiful.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.881
Thank ye, Miss Fraser.

12:54.560 --> 12:58.109
But there's much to be done,
and Mistress Cameron wilna be pleased--

12:58.190 --> 13:00.351
You let me worry about Mistress Cameron.

13:28.220 --> 13:29.426
Bnanna?

13:29.510 --> 13:30.636
Yes, Auntie?

13:31.310 --> 13:32.846
I have something for ye.

13:34.600 --> 13:38.263
If I recall correctly, these earrings
will look lovely with yer dress.

13:38.860 --> 13:41.727
Thank you, but I told Phaedre
I don't need a new dress.

13:43.780 --> 13:44.849
Aye, she mentioned that,

13:46.280 --> 13:49.989
which is why I'm having her alter
one of mine to fit ye instead.

13:51.120 --> 13:52.747
These are the earrings
I used to wear with it.

13:54.540 --> 13:56.667
That's very kind of you.

13:57.750 --> 13:59.160
Ye really should try it on.

13:59.250 --> 14:02.242
She'll need to take
some measurements, of course.

14:02.340 --> 14:05.047
We want ye to look yer best,
dear, for the dinner.

14:05.510 --> 14:08.172
It's no every day a lord
graces these halls.

14:13.060 --> 14:15.426
I ken ye're consumed with worry,

14:15.520 --> 14:18.057
and biding yer time here
with naught to do about it.

14:18.150 --> 14:20.266
It's distressing, at the very least,

14:20.360 --> 14:23.147
but there's comfort to be found
in the company of others.

14:23.690 --> 14:27.399
Will ye no enjoy some food,
some lively conversation?

14:27.740 --> 14:33.360
Thank you, but I'm honestly happier
being by myself, reading, drawing.

14:35.580 --> 14:36.786
Hmm.

14:37.790 --> 14:38.996
I used to paint.

14:40.080 --> 14:43.664
I was never as talented
as yer grandmother, Ellen.

14:46.130 --> 14:47.711
I don't know much about her.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.176
She was an artist?

14:50.260 --> 14:51.295
Aye.

14:53.350 --> 14:54.635
You...

14:54.720 --> 14:56.381
Ye're very much like her.

14:57.350 --> 14:58.806
Ye have her spirit.

14:59.600 --> 15:00.589
Ido?

15:00.940 --> 15:02.851
She was our father's favourite.

15:03.650 --> 15:05.606
She remained unmarried well past the time

15:05.690 --> 15:09.239
a young woman ought to be settled
with a husband, but...

15:11.160 --> 15:14.823
He wouldna force her into a marriage
she herself wouldn't accept.

15:16.330 --> 15:17.786
How modern of him.

15:18.080 --> 15:20.662
She was headstrong. Followed her heart.

15:22.210 --> 15:25.839
And after Father died,
she wed the man she truly loved.

15:26.920 --> 15:27.966
Brian Fraser.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.506
Our father would've been happy for her.

15:33.180 --> 15:34.169
You're right.

15:34.470 --> 15:36.461
Conversation is good for a worried mind.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.302
Aye, and there's plenty more to be had.

15:40.690 --> 15:44.353
Phaedre is waiting for ye
in yer chamber with the dress.

16:27.270 --> 16:29.397
Sorry! Did I wake ye?

16:30.280 --> 16:31.770
Trouble sleeping, lass?

16:40.620 --> 16:44.704
All this about the taxes,
with the governor and the Regulators...

16:46.840 --> 16:48.205
D'ye think it'll come to anythin'?

16:48.590 --> 16:50.160
I think mebbe it will, aye.

17:03.520 --> 17:04.930
Then I'm hoping ye'll do somethin'.

17:08.730 --> 17:11.483
Tell Fergus ye want him
to fight alongside ye.

17:13.950 --> 17:16.157
Marriage not all ye hoped
it would be, lass?

17:16.740 --> 17:19.072
If ye're wanting rid of him,
I can take him out back and--

17:19.160 --> 17:21.617
IfI wanted him shot, I'd do it myself.

17:21.700 --> 17:23.497
And it wouldna be fair
to take him out first.

17:23.580 --> 17:25.957
He doesna put his boots on my blankets.

17:26.580 --> 17:27.569
Christ.

17:36.840 --> 17:40.344
I'd like ye to ask Fergus
to join ye and yer men

17:41.640 --> 17:47.010
to fight, if and when the time comes.

17:48.190 --> 17:49.600
Lass, his...

17:49.690 --> 17:50.679
Aye.

17:51.610 --> 17:52.770
I ken.

17:55.530 --> 17:57.691
Then ye understand why I'm asking ye.

18:08.380 --> 18:09.449
Aye.

18:10.670 --> 18:12.080
I'll have a whole man,

18:13.380 --> 18:14.665
or none at all.

18:28.480 --> 18:29.970
Miss Fraser is here, Mistress.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.145
Mmm.

18:31.230 --> 18:33.221
Ladies and gentlemen,

18:33.530 --> 18:37.102
may I present my niece, Brianna Fraser.

19:08.520 --> 19:10.010
The Forbes, Mistress.

19:10.100 --> 19:14.355
Brianna, this is Gerald Forbes
and his sister, Prudence Forbes.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.441
I've been looking forward
to this occasion.

19:22.830 --> 19:25.071
Have you been enjoying
your time at River Run?

19:25.620 --> 19:26.826
Yes.

19:26.910 --> 19:29.322
My aunt has been a most generous hostess.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.570
How do you spend your days here?

19:31.670 --> 19:33.410
Drawing, mostly.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.331
The lass is quite accomplished.

19:35.420 --> 19:37.877
Splendid! What sort of things do you draw?

19:38.220 --> 19:40.290
I recently finished a portrait of Phaedre.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.506
Oh.

19:41.590 --> 19:45.253
I presume you mean the Phaedre
of Greek mythology, wife of Theseus.

19:45.760 --> 19:49.344
Yes. A good, strong, Greek name.

19:49.730 --> 19:52.767
I believe Phaedre is one of the slaves
here at River Run.

19:52.860 --> 19:54.725
You mean to say you draw Negroes?

19:56.400 --> 19:59.028
Brianna, I don't believe
you've had the pleasure.

19:59.110 --> 20:04.309
This is Mistress Alderdyce and her son,
the Honourable Judge Alderdyce.

20:04.700 --> 20:06.577
I draw whatever inspires me.

20:07.290 --> 20:09.406
Very courageous. I'd love to see it.

20:09.660 --> 20:12.242
I could have Ulysses fetch it
for you, if you'd like.

20:12.330 --> 20:14.742
Oh, heavens, no.
What is the world coming to?

20:14.840 --> 20:18.913
To think you'd choose that as your subject
in a beautiful place such as this.

20:19.460 --> 20:20.870
Why not a landscape?

20:21.380 --> 20:23.211
Young folk today, my goodness.

20:23.300 --> 20:24.847
Whatever shall we do with them?

20:24.930 --> 20:27.967
_ I'm sure Lieutenant Wolff
Will have some thoughts to share.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.425
Where are ye, dear friend?

20:29.520 --> 20:34.548
I have newfound empathy
for your great-aunt's lack of sight.

20:37.360 --> 20:38.429
You're too kind.

20:38.530 --> 20:40.236
With your aunt's permission,

20:40.650 --> 20:43.733
I'd like to take you
on an excursion to New Bern,

20:44.700 --> 20:48.579
to show you some
of the magnificent sights.

20:50.540 --> 20:52.326
Perhaps, sometime.

20:52.710 --> 20:56.589
Miss Fraser, there is something
I wish to show you.

20:57.290 --> 21:00.339
Perhaps you would be so good
as to accompany me?

21:05.090 --> 21:06.216
Bnanna.

21:11.810 --> 21:14.722
Perhaps we should all
join them in the parlour.

21:15.230 --> 21:16.219
Ulysses.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.606
Mistress.

21:35.420 --> 21:37.126
I'm thinking of having one of these stones

21:37.210 --> 21:40.998
fashioned into a piece of jewellery,
a gift.

21:42.630 --> 21:45.463
Tell me, my dear,
which one pleases you most?

21:45.930 --> 21:48.467
The sapphire, the emerald, the topaz,

21:49.050 --> 21:50.051
or the diamond?

21:50.470 --> 21:54.975
With your instinct for loveliness,
you would have a most valuable opinion,

21:55.060 --> 21:57.051
should you be willing
to oblige me with it.

21:58.650 --> 21:59.719
I...

22:00.690 --> 22:02.726
shouldn't like to venture my own opinion

22:02.820 --> 22:05.448
without first hearing
Mistress Alderdyce's choice.

22:05.530 --> 22:06.770
Well, I...

22:07.110 --> 22:09.522
May I present Lord John Grey.

22:18.250 --> 22:19.786
Greetings, one and all.

22:21.550 --> 22:24.872
Mistress Cameron, very glad to be here.

22:25.170 --> 22:27.172
I'm sure a splendid evening awaits us.

22:27.260 --> 22:29.842
Ye're most welcome here, my lord.

22:30.180 --> 22:33.013
Please, allow me to introduce my niece.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.236
Miss Fraser, undoubtedly.

22:47.530 --> 22:49.270
I'm an acquaintance of your parents.

22:59.710 --> 23:00.870
I need...

23:02.290 --> 23:05.453
I need to lay my hands
on as many rifles as possible.

23:07.090 --> 23:10.548
Maybe I should just teach the Regulators
how to wail instead.

23:10.640 --> 23:11.880
It's very effective.

23:12.180 --> 23:13.841
Son, son.

23:14.220 --> 23:17.098
It seems there are some here
who do not apprecrate

23:17.180 --> 23:19.387
your contribution to the cause.

23:27.900 --> 23:28.889
Join us, will ye?

23:29.150 --> 23:30.151
What?

23:32.410 --> 23:33.729
Join our militia.

23:39.330 --> 23:40.410
You want me?

23:40.500 --> 23:41.626
Ye've courage,

23:42.500 --> 23:43.580
and I trust ye.

23:44.710 --> 23:46.507
If I'm to fight Tryon's army,

23:46.590 --> 23:49.377
I can think of no man
I'd rather have by my side.

23:52.890 --> 23:54.426
I'm honoured that you've asked...

23:57.140 --> 23:58.129
But...

24:02.400 --> 24:06.473
But my place is here,
with Marsali and Germain.

24:12.950 --> 24:14.065
'Tis here.

24:14.160 --> 24:16.537
The ship ye've been waiting for,
the
Gloriana,
'tis in port.

24:16.950 --> 24:18.110
Off wi' ye, then.

24:27.090 --> 24:28.159
Thank ye.

24:38.680 --> 24:41.262
And the woman claimed to tell fortunes
by holding a personal Item.

24:41.600 --> 24:43.727
It was rather amusing, I must admit,

24:43.810 --> 24:46.267
though not the strangest thing
that happened during my time in Jamaica.

24:46.980 --> 24:48.811
A very strange place indeed,

24:49.820 --> 24:51.481
though that is a story for another glass.

24:57.370 --> 24:58.359
Your turn.

25:00.200 --> 25:02.202
I've embarrassed myself enough
for one evening, surely.

25:02.750 --> 25:03.819
Oh, I...

25:04.170 --> 25:06.741
I don't have any anecdotes
half as entertaining as yours,

25:07.040 --> 25:08.837
and I'm certainly no fortune teller,

25:08.920 --> 25:11.718
but I do have something
for occasions such as these

25:11.800 --> 25:15.429
that I learned a long time ago
on the subject of psychology.

25:15.640 --> 25:16.755
Oh.

25:16.850 --> 25:19.387
The science of the soul, if you will.

25:19.470 --> 25:21.267
Well, it sounds intriguing.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.227
Yet it only works with strangers.

25:23.310 --> 25:24.299
Might we all partake?

25:24.390 --> 25:27.143
Of course. I'll ask you a few questions,

25:27.230 --> 25:29.892
and I want you to picture
whatever comes to mind first.

25:30.400 --> 25:32.391
Oh, and you might want to close your eyes.

25:32.490 --> 25:34.105
Hmm.
This does sound interesting.

25:34.570 --> 25:35.605
- Oh.
- Happy to oblige.

25:35.700 --> 25:38.658
Must I close my eyes
when you are before me?

25:40.040 --> 25:41.029
Yes.

25:45.170 --> 25:48.242
I want you to imagine
that you're in a forest with someone.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.240
Can you picture the person?

25:51.000 --> 25:52.627
Yes.

25:52.710 --> 25:54.007
Yes, clear as day.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.585
YOU encounter an animal.

25:56.760 --> 25:57.829
Should we tell you what it is?

25:57.930 --> 25:59.136
- Not yet.
- Ah.

25:59.220 --> 26:01.632
I want you to imagine
that you reach a clearing.

26:03.180 --> 26:04.340
You may open your eyes.

26:07.270 --> 26:08.476
Is that it?

26:08.560 --> 26:10.721
Now, one at a time,
you'll tell me what you saw,

26:10.820 --> 26:13.186
and I'll tell you
what each answer represents,

26:13.280 --> 26:14.520
symbolically speaking.

26:14.900 --> 26:15.946
What fun.

26:16.030 --> 26:18.407
Judge Alderdyce,
are you happy to go first?

26:20.620 --> 26:22.156
Who was with you in the forest?

26:23.410 --> 26:24.957
I was walking with Christ.

26:25.710 --> 26:27.075
And the animal you saw?

26:27.170 --> 26:28.159
A squirrel.

26:28.380 --> 26:30.917
One very particular fellow, in fact.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.201
Frequents my mother's garden each morning.

26:33.300 --> 26:34.289
Hmm.

26:35.050 --> 26:37.541
You see, when a person
is walking with Christ,

26:37.800 --> 26:40.462
it can mean that
they're seeking forgiveness,

26:40.850 --> 26:43.466
- or reassurance for something.
-Hmm.

26:45.430 --> 26:48.092
Given my occupation, it's no surprise

26:48.190 --> 26:51.353
that the notion of forgiveness
is often on my mind.

26:51.820 --> 26:55.392
Yes, but when walking
with Christ yourself,

26:55.650 --> 26:58.733
coupled with the squirrel
you saw in your mother's garden...

26:59.490 --> 27:02.698
You see, the animal you encounter
represents life's problems,

27:02.780 --> 27:05.783
and given that squirrels
tend to hoard things away,

27:05.870 --> 27:09.579
it would seem that
your problems are secrets.

27:10.380 --> 27:13.031
Something Mrs Alderdyce
doesn't know about, then,

27:13.630 --> 27:15.450
since the squirrel was in her garden.

27:15.840 --> 27:19.048
I assure you, I know everything
there is to know about my son.

27:19.380 --> 27:21.177
Of course.

27:21.930 --> 27:25.639
If you'll excuse me for a moment,
I must take some air.

27:30.100 --> 27:31.180
Well, well.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.811
There may be something in this after all.

27:34.610 --> 27:35.599
Very entertaining.

27:36.230 --> 27:39.449
My niece is a clever lass indeed.

27:39.530 --> 27:41.521
- She is.
- She is, aye.

27:46.580 --> 27:48.992
So, Lord John, dare I ask,

27:49.660 --> 27:50.911
who was with you in the forest?

27:52.290 --> 27:54.417
Oh. Uh...

27:54.500 --> 27:55.489
It was--

27:55.590 --> 27:57.376
You don't have to think too hard about it.

27:57.710 --> 27:58.870
Who came to mind first?

28:01.130 --> 28:02.131
Your father.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.255
I thought of your father.

28:05.970 --> 28:07.301
Oh.

28:07.720 --> 28:08.800
Why would you think of him?

28:08.890 --> 28:11.222
Well, you are sitting
right here in front of me.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.515
And he did ask me to look in on you.

28:17.320 --> 28:18.810
And why would you need to do that?

28:19.320 --> 28:22.153
He merely wrote to ask
that I visit to ensure all is well.

28:23.200 --> 28:25.942
He mentioned he was_about
to embark upon a long journey.

28:28.580 --> 28:31.959
And he gave no reason at all
as to why all might not be well?

28:32.210 --> 28:33.199
No.

28:33.880 --> 28:36.917
But from your response,
I'm beginning to suspect it might not be.

28:39.260 --> 28:41.296
Your father would never divulge
anything that you yourself

28:41.380 --> 28:42.586
would not wish to tell me.

28:43.590 --> 28:44.716
He's an honourable man.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.261
Don't talk to me
about my father's honour.

28:52.560 --> 28:53.936
If you'll excuse me...

28:54.850 --> 28:55.896
Is it my turn?

28:57.520 --> 29:00.068
I'm eager to tell you
who my forest companion was.

29:00.400 --> 29:03.699
Perhaps we could take a walk
on the grounds and discuss in more detail.

29:08.790 --> 29:11.281
Oh... I'm feeling quite unwell.

29:13.580 --> 29:15.070
Oh, my dear!

29:15.960 --> 29:16.949
What's happened?

29:17.040 --> 29:19.122
Miss Brianna just fainted, Mistress,
but Lord John was there.

29:19.210 --> 29:21.917
Lord John, please escort my niece
into the parlour.

29:22.090 --> 29:24.251
Ulysses, more wine for everyone.

29:27.970 --> 29:29.426
A cold cloth will help.

29:29.510 --> 29:31.137
I'm more than willing
to ride out and summon a physician.

29:31.220 --> 29:32.426
No, that won't be necessary.

29:32.520 --> 29:33.509
Oh, Mistress.

29:34.020 --> 29:37.604
Oh, I was so worried when I heard
that ye'd fainted, and in yer condition.

29:40.900 --> 29:41.935
Lizzie, I'm fine.

29:42.440 --> 29:44.567
Really, I'm feeling much better.

29:45.910 --> 29:48.276
Would you like me to go
and prepare your bedchamber?

29:48.370 --> 29:49.439
I'd appreciate that.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.115
Miss Fraser...

29:57.000 --> 29:59.787
So you are not ill, as such?

30:01.210 --> 30:03.087
Am I to understand you are to be a mother?

30:05.300 --> 30:07.086
One of the entertaining anecdotes

30:07.180 --> 30:09.592
I decided not to share
at the dinner table.

30:10.510 --> 30:12.512
Your father didn't tell me
about this, you know.

30:18.350 --> 30:19.601
Did you lose your husband?

30:21.190 --> 30:23.897
I suppose I did lose him, in a way, yes.

30:25.110 --> 30:27.158
My father allowed him
to be traded to the Mohawk.

30:27.490 --> 30:31.938
It's a long story, but they're searching
for him as we speak.

30:32.040 --> 30:33.234
That's where they are?

30:33.580 --> 30:36.538
Jamie, your parents are going to
rescue this man from the Mohawk?

30:36.620 --> 30:40.408
Yes. I wanted to go with them,
but my condition wouldn't allow for it,

30:40.710 --> 30:43.201
so I made them promise
they'd bring him back to me.

30:43.300 --> 30:45.165
And Mistress Cameron
is fully apprised of this?

30:45.380 --> 30:48.338
She certainly is,
and yet I'm starting to suspect

30:48.430 --> 30:50.421
that it's part of the reason
for this dinner.

30:50.510 --> 30:52.887
She is trying to secure me a husband.

30:53.010 --> 30:54.011
I see.

30:55.430 --> 30:58.649
Surely you cannot take another husband
if you're already married?

30:58.730 --> 31:02.109
Well, Roger and I were handfast,
with no witnesses.

31:02.320 --> 31:03.935
That is a predicament.

31:07.820 --> 31:10.106
When your father wrote
and asked for me to come,

31:10.990 --> 31:12.480
he enclosed a letter,

31:12.580 --> 31:14.616
and said I was to deliver it
to you personally.

31:16.580 --> 31:19.413
Miss_ Fraser seems
to be feeling well once more.

31:19.500 --> 31:21.627
Oh, I'm very glad to hear that.

31:22.090 --> 31:24.206
Well, it's late.

31:24.880 --> 31:26.165
Tomorrow is a new day.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.921
If you'll permit it,
we'll speak again in the morning.

31:29.470 --> 31:30.539
Good night.

31:32.930 --> 31:35.672
Mistress Cameron,
thank you for a lovely dinner.

31:36.430 --> 31:38.091
You are a most gracious hostess.

31:38.180 --> 31:40.933
My pleasure, Your Lordship.

31:46.650 --> 31:49.608
Ulysses, I'd like a word with my aunt.

31:52.070 --> 31:56.074
Phaedre, let us prepare the bedchambers
for the guests staying overnight.

32:03.790 --> 32:05.087
May I speak frankly?

32:05.250 --> 32:06.410
Of course.

32:07.010 --> 32:09.080
Ye've been doing so all evening.

32:11.550 --> 32:16.089
I couldn't help but notice that most
of your guests are unmarried men.

32:16.350 --> 32:19.478
Lord John was married.

32:19.560 --> 32:21.096
His wife took ill and passed.

32:21.190 --> 32:22.339
And the rest?

32:22.440 --> 32:24.556
You just pulled them out of a hat?

32:25.270 --> 32:27.352
What a strange expression.

32:28.480 --> 32:29.981
They're my friends.

32:30.700 --> 32:32.941
Gentlemen I've been acquainted
with for many years,

32:33.030 --> 32:35.828
any one of whom would make
an acceptable suitor.

32:35.910 --> 32:40.745
If we are speaking frankly, niece,
it's time we found you a husband.

32:40.830 --> 32:42.286
And what if I don't want a husband?

32:42.370 --> 32:43.746
What does want have to do with it?

32:43.880 --> 32:45.074
Everything!

32:45.170 --> 32:46.410
Everything?

32:46.500 --> 32:48.331
Ye've a bairn coming.

32:48.840 --> 32:51.252
Yer time to be particular is long past.

32:51.340 --> 32:53.717
Ye've nothing, not a penny to yer name,

32:53.800 --> 32:56.507
a name at risk
of being tarnished, at that.

32:57.470 --> 33:00.519
Ye have to think of yer future,
yer security.

33:01.480 --> 33:04.972
A marriage to one of these men
will be of great benefit to ye.

33:07.070 --> 33:08.685
And to you as well, no doubt.

33:09.980 --> 33:13.108
The union of two families
is always a blessmg.

33:13.530 --> 33:14.690
What about love?

33:15.030 --> 33:17.112
You said my grandmother married for love.

33:17.200 --> 33:18.189
Aye.

33:18.910 --> 33:20.070
She did.

33:21.580 --> 33:25.459
Like ye, Ellen was with child
before she wed.

33:25.540 --> 33:28.873
Our brothers Colum and Dougal
tried to arrange a marriage for her,

33:28.960 --> 33:33.249
but she outwitted them
when she eloped with Brian Fraser.

33:33.340 --> 33:34.375
But...

33:35.130 --> 33:38.964
The important thing is,
the bairn was born in wedlock.

33:40.100 --> 33:43.934
If yours is not,
he'll be branded a fatherless bastard.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.055
His life will be ruined.

33:56.240 --> 33:57.275
Bnanna.

33:58.410 --> 34:00.617
I ken ye once had a man ye loved,

34:02.040 --> 34:03.189
but he's gone.

34:03.790 --> 34:06.702
It's not what ye want to hear,
but he's not coming back.

34:06.790 --> 34:10.453
He's with the savages now,
be it dead or alive.

34:14.550 --> 34:17.212
The sooner ye accept that, the better.

34:19.930 --> 34:21.557
Ye canna live on hope.

34:49.960 --> 34:51.245
There, that's him.

35:09.100 --> 35:10.761
We need him on his own.

35:16.110 --> 35:17.441
I have a plan.

35:25.910 --> 35:27.116
Hello.

35:32.460 --> 35:33.950
Uh. Uh-uh.

35:37.760 --> 35:40.752
Think you've got the wrong room, sir.

35:40.840 --> 35:42.000
Aye.

35:42.090 --> 35:43.546
I'm looking for a gentleman.

35:44.260 --> 35:45.466
You're no gentleman.

37:17.730 --> 37:19.391
Bring the horse closer.

37:22.820 --> 37:24.447
What's all this?

37:24.530 --> 37:25.770
What have you done to that man?

37:29.910 --> 37:31.070
Return to yer wife and child.

37:31.160 --> 37:32.616
What are you doing?

37:33.210 --> 37:35.360
Unhand him!

37:39.590 --> 37:40.625
You should go.

37:41.380 --> 37:43.371
Something very familiar about you.

37:43.510 --> 37:46.252
Strange. Dinna think
we've had the pleasure.

37:46.390 --> 37:48.506
I do think ye'll find there's
something very familiar

37:48.600 --> 37:51.763
about my companion, Stephen Bonnet.

37:53.020 --> 37:54.635
- The murd_erer?
- Aye, 'tis.

37:55.060 --> 37:56.049
Who escaped the gallows?

37:56.560 --> 38:01.179
I have seen you before,
on a broadsheet, Murtagh Fitzgibbons.

38:01.480 --> 38:02.481
Take him.

38:10.450 --> 38:12.031
Good mornin', Miss Fraser.

38:12.120 --> 38:15.704
Mistress Cameron is askin' ye
to come down for some tea.

38:15.830 --> 38:17.957
I'm to dress ye in something
especially becomin'.

38:19.340 --> 38:20.329
Why is that?

38:23.880 --> 38:28.169
Mister Forbes was quite taken
with ye last night.

38:29.050 --> 38:32.008
He intends to ask
for yer hand in marriage.

38:33.640 --> 38:35.471
Mistress Cameron gave her blessing.

38:37.650 --> 38:38.765
I'm sure she did.

38:40.150 --> 38:41.515
Are ye no pleased?

38:41.940 --> 38:43.396
Of course I'm pleased.

38:43.480 --> 38:47.064
I just... I need some time
to prepare myself, to take some air.

38:47.200 --> 38:48.690
Would you tell my aunt
that when you came to wake me,

38:48.780 --> 38:49.815
I'd gone on my morning walk?

38:51.740 --> 38:53.230
If ye dinna mind me askin',

38:53.330 --> 38:55.867
how long should I tell
the mistress ye'll be?

38:58.170 --> 39:02.129
I'll join you in an hour or so, I promise,
and will you send Lizzie to see me?

39:15.930 --> 39:17.886
- I need your help.
- Anything, Mistress.

39:17.980 --> 39:20.687
Find Lord John and ask him to meet me
in the grounds by the large oak.

39:21.310 --> 39:23.517
And, Lizzie, be discreet.

39:28.740 --> 39:30.150
It's not too cold for you?

39:30.490 --> 39:31.650
No. You?

39:33.240 --> 39:34.696
I enjoy the brisk air.

39:35.490 --> 39:39.494
I would comment on the weather,
or ask your opinion on the gardens,

39:40.710 --> 39:43.531
but with the time passing,
I wanted to ask instead...

39:45.090 --> 39:46.455
Will you marry me?

39:54.140 --> 39:55.767
Oh, dear God in heaven.

39:57.350 --> 39:58.806
I'm not sure this_is what
your father had in mind

39:58.890 --> 39:59.879
when he asked me to look in on you.

39:59.980 --> 40:02.892
I know, but if I didn't ask,
for the sake of my child--

40:02.980 --> 40:04.936
You are your father's daughter.
That's certain.

40:05.020 --> 40:06.647
Look, I don't want any of your money.

40:06.730 --> 40:08.311
I'll sign a paper saying so.

40:08.610 --> 40:10.521
You wouldn't have to live with me, either,

40:10.610 --> 40:12.817
although I should probably
come to Virginia with you,

40:12.910 --> 40:14.275
at least for a little while.

40:17.290 --> 40:20.578
Jamie is one of the people
I cherish most on this Earth,

40:21.080 --> 40:23.412
and drawn to you for reasons
I cannot explain, but...

40:25.090 --> 40:27.126
I cannot take your hand in marriage.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.750
Lord John, if you refuse my offer,

40:35.390 --> 40:37.381
it is with deep regret
that I'll have to reveal

40:37.470 --> 40:40.348
what I saw you doing last night
with one of my supposed suitors.

40:40.430 --> 40:42.648
Whatever it is you think you saw,
you're quite mistaken.

40:42.730 --> 40:46.359
No, I know what I saw,
and I will write letters

40:46.440 --> 40:47.976
to the governor, the sheriff--

40:48.070 --> 40:51.198
Knowing the severity of the punishment
of this crime, you would do that?

40:51.280 --> 40:53.521
- My life would be ruined.
- Then I'll tell Jamie.

40:55.620 --> 40:57.611
Well, that's assuming
he doesn't already know,

40:58.580 --> 41:01.538
and as you said yourself,
he's otherwise engaged.

41:05.420 --> 41:07.285
In an actual forest somewhere.

41:09.380 --> 41:12.679
You imagined him when I asked at dinner.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.882
You pictured yourself
with Jamie in the forest.

41:15.050 --> 41:16.540
You could've picked anyone.

41:17.470 --> 41:19.131
Your late wife, for instance.

41:19.270 --> 41:22.387
I am almost tempted to submit
to your outrageous proposal.

41:23.190 --> 41:25.306
It would certainly teach you
to play with fire.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.936
That sounds like a threat.

41:29.780 --> 41:30.849
You mean you...

41:31.740 --> 41:32.729
With women, too?

41:32.820 --> 41:33.889
I was married.

41:34.860 --> 41:36.987
It wasn't an arrangement
of convenience, then.

41:37.070 --> 41:40.779
I am perfectly capable of carrying out
my husbandly duties, I assure you.

41:52.460 --> 41:53.666
Come.

41:55.760 --> 41:57.136
Let's sit for a moment.

42:07.940 --> 42:09.259
I'm sorry, Brianna,

42:10.690 --> 42:12.021
but I cannot marry you.

42:13.440 --> 42:14.691
No, I'm sorry.

42:15.110 --> 42:16.566
I know I sound insane.

42:17.450 --> 42:20.658
And I really wouldn't have said
a word to anybody.

42:22.700 --> 42:23.746
No.

42:24.790 --> 42:26.200
Not entirely insane.

42:30.710 --> 42:33.122
When I close my eyes,
I do see your father...

42:35.880 --> 42:37.370
But I also see your mother.

42:40.550 --> 42:42.177
Their connection with each other.

42:43.520 --> 42:44.509
Their love.

42:45.060 --> 42:47.016
Does she know? My mother?

42:48.400 --> 42:51.267
She is a perceptive woman, as are you.

42:55.360 --> 42:56.941
I agree with your aunt.

42:57.030 --> 42:58.099
You should marry.

42:59.280 --> 43:01.908
But you understand now
why I cannot be your husband.

43:04.450 --> 43:06.247
I have faith in your parents.

43:07.620 --> 43:09.781
They will find Roger
and bring him back to you.

43:11.380 --> 43:12.870
You mustn't give up hope.

43:18.090 --> 43:19.796
There's something else, isn't there?

43:28.100 --> 43:30.148
Even if they do bring Roger back,

43:31.900 --> 43:33.856
he might not want to...

43:36.820 --> 43:38.981
He might not be the...

43:39.610 --> 43:40.656
What is it?

43:45.540 --> 43:47.997
I was violated.

43:50.080 --> 43:51.627
And the baby...

43:53.460 --> 43:55.416
I don't know whose...

43:58.380 --> 44:00.371
- Do you know this man?
- No.

44:01.720 --> 44:03.381
No, I found out later.

44:05.350 --> 44:08.012
His name is Stephen Bonnet.

44:13.190 --> 44:15.067
And Forbes is about to propose.

44:18.650 --> 44:20.197
IfI marry him,

44:21.490 --> 44:24.323
I'll be exchanging hope
for a broken heart.

44:31.830 --> 44:33.240
But I'll do what I must.

44:35.130 --> 44:36.620
For the sake of my child.

44:37.550 --> 44:38.790
I'll do what I must.

44:44.470 --> 44:46.131
Jocasta's expecting me.

44:57.520 --> 45:00.239
I'll not forget your part
in all this, Mistress Cameron.

45:00.320 --> 45:03.312
The union of our families
is a blessmg to us all.

45:05.410 --> 45:06.399
Niece.

45:09.080 --> 45:10.115
Good morning, Aunt.

45:10.200 --> 45:12.828
Mister Forbes has a matter
to put before you.

45:19.250 --> 45:20.330
I...

45:20.420 --> 45:22.251
Thank you for waiting for me, my dear.

45:23.470 --> 45:25.040
Have you told them our good news?

45:27.100 --> 45:28.169
No, I haven't.

45:28.890 --> 45:30.801
I've asked _for Miss Fraser's
hand in marriage,

45:32.520 --> 45:33.930
and she has accepted.

45:38.520 --> 45:40.067
A joyous occasion.

45:41.610 --> 45:42.645
Indeed.

45:47.490 --> 45:49.367
Had you not encouraged me
to find a husband,

45:49.450 --> 45:52.328
I would never have opened
my heart to Lord John.

45:52.830 --> 45:54.741
Thank you, Aunt Jocasta.

45:57.840 --> 45:58.829
Good day to you all.

45:59.550 --> 46:00.665
Mister Forbes.

46:09.560 --> 46:10.800
Come to me, my dear.

46:17.560 --> 46:19.266
I dinna ken how you managed it.

46:19.360 --> 46:21.396
A MacKenzie ye truly are.

46:22.900 --> 46:25.448
What wonderful news.

46:34.540 --> 46:35.529
Christ!

46:41.340 --> 46:42.489
Are you all right?

46:44.720 --> 46:46.119
It's nothing, Sassenach.

46:49.050 --> 46:50.426
Rollo, what's that?

46:50.510 --> 46:52.171
Rollo, what is that, boy?

46:52.970 --> 46:55.222
Here, here. Rollo, let go!

46:56.140 --> 46:57.186
What is that?

47:00.400 --> 47:01.435
Auntie...

47:03.860 --> 47:04.929
That's human.

47:06.530 --> 47:08.191
Rollo! Rollo!

47:11.530 --> 47:12.519
Christ!

47:13.950 --> 47:14.939
Rollo!

47:19.880 --> 47:20.869
Rollo?

47:22.460 --> 47:23.700
Rollo, get back.

47:31.220 --> 47:33.882
He's been dead
for at least a month.

47:33.970 --> 47:35.301
I've seen this man before.

47:37.430 --> 47:38.806
When I sold Roger to the Mohawk.

47:41.980 --> 47:43.060
That waistcoat,

47:43.940 --> 47:45.316
and missing two fingers.

47:48.990 --> 47:50.355
He was with Roger.

48:00.210 --> 48:01.199
Claire?

48:01.330 --> 48:02.877
I didn't find anything.

48:03.880 --> 48:05.450
I went nearly a mile.

48:06.960 --> 48:07.961
Nothing.

48:08.050 --> 48:09.039
Nothing?

48:13.470 --> 48:14.846
Well, then, there's hope.

48:16.060 --> 48:17.925
There's hope that Roger's still alive.

48:22.940 --> 48:24.976
What a world
to bring a child into.

48:27.650 --> 48:32.906
You know, I've said and done things
that I never thought I would, or could.

48:35.530 --> 48:39.443
Sometimes, people do the wrong thing
for the right reasons.

48:41.370 --> 48:43.531
I'm sure your father would know
something about that.

48:43.630 --> 48:44.665
Please don't.

48:45.290 --> 48:46.996
It doesn't change what's happened.

48:48.210 --> 48:49.199
No.

48:49.340 --> 48:51.251
But I don't know what's worse,

48:51.340 --> 48:54.173
dwelling on the past
or thinking about the future.

48:56.850 --> 48:58.670
If you were to see my son, William...

49:00.060 --> 49:03.223
His eyes lighting up
upon seeing something for the first time.

49:04.480 --> 49:06.016
You have a son.

49:07.360 --> 49:08.349
I didn't know that.

49:10.280 --> 49:11.850
He's in Lynchburg, Virginia.

49:12.200 --> 49:15.112
Well, if he is anything like his father,

49:16.530 --> 49:18.361
he must be a perfect gentleman.

49:18.450 --> 49:19.439
He is...

49:20.410 --> 49:22.037
very much like his father.

49:33.340 --> 49:34.796
But he's not truly mine.

49:40.680 --> 49:42.261
We don't share any blood.

49:45.190 --> 49:46.646
- You're a good man.
- No.

49:46.730 --> 49:48.186
Good doesn't come into it.

49:48.270 --> 49:50.181
I love him more than life itself.

49:52.030 --> 49:53.691
I am sure Roger will too...

49:54.360 --> 49:55.486
Love the child.

49:56.990 --> 49:58.070
The thing is,

49:59.200 --> 50:01.828
we're all here in this New World
not because it's new.

50:02.330 --> 50:04.036
These lands are as old as any.

50:05.670 --> 50:06.910
It's only new

50:07.880 --> 50:09.245
because there is hope.

50:11.300 --> 50:13.256
And hope is at the very heart of love.

50:56.930 --> 50:59.080
I canna help but think
someone'll be missin' him.

51:03.100 --> 51:04.465
One thing is certain.

51:05.850 --> 51:07.340
He was somebody's child.

51:45.640 --> 51:46.629
I'm sorry.

51:48.890 --> 51:51.973
I was upset, but not with you.

51:58.200 --> 51:59.269
Who else?

51:59.360 --> 52:01.908
Everybody. The world.

52:04.990 --> 52:06.366
Stephen Bonnet.

52:08.750 --> 52:10.206
But not you.

52:15.210 --> 52:18.509
Brianna used to confide in Frank.

52:20.510 --> 52:23.138
Sometimes with me.

52:24.180 --> 52:26.922
But when he died,
it was just the two of us.

52:27.560 --> 52:29.846
Any secrets were our secrets.

52:29.940 --> 52:31.055
And no one else.

52:33.900 --> 52:35.106
I'm sorry,

52:36.480 --> 52:39.392
I didn't tell you
it was Stephen Bonnet when I knew.

52:42.320 --> 52:46.689
Had I, it might have saved Roger.

52:51.120 --> 52:54.078
I never thought I would keep
a secret like that from you.

52:54.920 --> 52:56.239
Unﬁananna.

53:00.170 --> 53:04.049
When I made you that promise,
there was no one else in my life

53:04.140 --> 53:05.755
who could come before you...

53:08.720 --> 53:11.348
But I don't know ifI can keep
that promise any more.

53:17.860 --> 53:19.725
I understand...

53:20.860 --> 53:23.567
but I canna be a father to her, Claire.

53:25.370 --> 53:26.689
Of course you can,

53:29.080 --> 53:30.570
and you will.

53:30.660 --> 53:32.742
She's just hurt right now.

53:33.420 --> 53:34.819
No, she doesna need me.

53:38.420 --> 53:40.832
Never thought I'd be jealous
of a dead man.

53:43.680 --> 53:44.829
Of a...

53:45.640 --> 53:46.925
What, of Frank?

53:48.050 --> 53:49.460
Well, you heard what Bree said.

53:49.850 --> 53:54.435
Frank would have never said those things
to her or made the mistakes I made.

53:54.850 --> 53:57.102
Frank made plenty of mistakes.

53:58.900 --> 54:00.356
All parents do.

54:02.150 --> 54:04.061
Bree thinks he's a better man.

54:06.490 --> 54:07.730
I thought...

54:10.490 --> 54:13.197
I thought perhaps you were beginning
to feel the same, Sassenach.

54:17.500 --> 54:18.876
You fool.

54:24.630 --> 54:25.676
Come here.

54:26.680 --> 54:28.079
She didn't mean it.

54:30.720 --> 54:32.426
She doesn't want you to go to hell.

54:32.520 --> 54:33.669
I heard her.

54:35.350 --> 54:37.147
I hope I can bring Roger back to her,

54:38.150 --> 54:39.549
or she'll never forgive me.

54:40.070 --> 54:41.719
I heard you both.

54:44.070 --> 54:45.776
She's just like you.

54:46.320 --> 54:49.153
She says things in anger
that she doesn't mean.

54:51.200 --> 54:53.282
You didn't mean the things
you said to her, did you?

54:55.210 --> 54:56.245
No.

54:58.540 --> 54:59.916
Neither did she.

55:01.250 --> 55:02.239
Trust me.

55:08.800 --> 55:12.463
I love you both so much.

55:21.020 --> 55:22.146
Come here.

55:37.580 --> 55:38.865
I'm sorry.

55:40.630 --> 55:41.995
I'm sorry.

56:57.870 --> 57:00.532
What is this? What's going on?

57:01.080 --> 57:02.206
Huh?
