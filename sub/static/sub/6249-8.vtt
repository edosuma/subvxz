00:12.853 --> 00:15.162
Traffic?

00:15.253 --> 00:18.962
Dr Brennan looked hurt when I said
you asked me to come instead of her.

00:19.053 --> 00:22.204
No. Bones's feelings don't get hurt.
She's not like you.

00:22.293 --> 00:24.363
- Like me?
- Yeah, a girl.

00:24.453 --> 00:28.002
The word is "woman", who, incidentally,
makes more money than you.

00:28.093 --> 00:30.653
- Touchy.
- I'm just a girl with feelings.

00:30.733 --> 00:34.646
Construction crew found a body
this afternoon. Key word is "body",

00:34.733 --> 00:37.201
as in "still meaty". Oh!

00:39.893 --> 00:44.683
- Male, middle-aged.
- Bones usually kneels next to the remains.

00:44.773 --> 00:48.766
These are designer pants. My bodies
are always gushier than Dr Brennan's.

00:48.853 --> 00:51.287
I'm just saying.

00:52.973 --> 00:57.285
Looks like a stab wound to the middle
of the chest. Naked, wrapped in plastic.

00:57.373 --> 01:00.888
Bite marks to the face and extremities.
Looks like rats.

01:00.973 --> 01:02.929
Rats?

01:03.973 --> 01:08.763
Looks like he might've been
kneecapped. Mob thing maybe?

01:10.333 --> 01:14.292
- What's that?
- Some kind of gemstone.

01:18.133 --> 01:22.365
This blow to the sternum would've been fatal,
dealt by a double-edged blade.

01:22.453 --> 01:26.890
- So we know our killer is strong.
- I'd say he's been dead three days.

01:26.973 --> 01:31.046
- Probably dumped Friday night.
- Gem is jade. I'm narrowing down the type.

01:31.133 --> 01:34.603
- Grit from the wounds.
-  Grit to you, open book to me.

01:34.693 --> 01:38.481
The injuries to the knees
aren't from baseball bats or bullets.

01:38.573 --> 01:41.929
Zack is right. The victim's patellas
were removed surgically.

01:42.013 --> 01:45.050
King of the lab.

02:03.013 --> 02:05.368
- Dr Brennan?
- Yes?

02:05.453 --> 02:07.887
Amy Hollister.

02:07.973 --> 02:10.851
- I'm your brother's girlfriend.
- Of course. Come in.

02:10.933 --> 02:12.924
Thanks.

02:15.093 --> 02:20.565
- Would you like something to drink?
- No, no. I'm sorry. I don't have a lot of time.

02:20.653 --> 02:23.292
Do you know where Russ is?

02:23.373 --> 02:26.445
Amy, I haven't seen Russ in months.

02:28.293 --> 02:30.602
Um...

02:31.373 --> 02:33.409
I have two little girls.
You know.

02:33.493 --> 02:39.284
And, um, the youngest one, that's Hayley,
she's not doing too good.

02:39.373 --> 02:41.648
Cystic fibrosis.

02:41.733 --> 02:44.725
Russ mentioned
that she had lung problems.

02:44.813 --> 02:49.762
Well, her breathing's real bad.
And... now her liver.

02:49.853 --> 02:52.925
She keeps asking for Russ.

02:53.013 --> 02:54.651
Um...

02:54.733 --> 02:57.167
I'm going to give you the...

02:57.693 --> 03:01.129
phone number of Dr Leo Goetz.

03:01.213 --> 03:04.808
He's the premier authority
on cystic fibrosis in the country.

03:04.893 --> 03:07.088
I can't afford that.

03:07.533 --> 03:10.411
Oh, no, Amy. Um...
Leo and I are friends.

03:10.493 --> 03:14.327
He'd do it for me as a favour.
No charge.

03:14.413 --> 03:17.564
I'm going to give him a call,
tell him to expect you.

03:17.653 --> 03:24.092
- I don't know what to say. Thank you.
- As for Russ, you're better off talking to Dad.

03:24.173 --> 03:27.483
I understand.
Um... thank you for your time.

04:06.573 --> 04:08.609
The knees.

04:40.413 --> 04:44.804
Somebody sent you human kneecaps
in the mail? That is, like... bleurgh!

04:44.893 --> 04:47.691
- They match our victim.
- We're dusting for prints.

04:47.773 --> 04:49.206
It was sent from DC.

04:49.293 --> 04:51.853
- These patellas are unusually worn.
- From what?

04:51.933 --> 04:54.766
It's hard to say,
but I'd say he did a lot of kneeling.

04:54.853 --> 04:59.847
Wait. I've seen that before. That symbol looks
familiar, like it's from some kind of seal.

04:59.933 --> 05:03.369
Bones, you are gonna stay with a friend?
Check into a hotel?

05:03.453 --> 05:06.809
- She can stay with me.
- Thank you. No. Why?

05:06.893 --> 05:10.602
- Mr Kneecaps has your home address.
- So somebody Googled me.

05:10.693 --> 05:12.923
- She goes nowhere alone.
- Don't listen.

05:13.013 --> 05:16.642
- Who are you more afraid of, me or her?
- Booth...

05:16.733 --> 05:19.850
So this is what it's like
to be a kindergarten teacher.

05:19.933 --> 05:23.369
- It's fascinating interpersonal interaction.
- Dr Sweets?

05:23.453 --> 05:25.125
I, uh...

05:25.213 --> 05:27.602
Oh, my...
That is gross.

05:27.693 --> 05:30.765
It's no place for therapists.
What do you want?

05:30.853 --> 05:34.050
Um, you and Dr Brennan
missed our session this morning.

05:34.133 --> 05:37.762
Maybe because somebody sent body parts
to Bones in the mail.

05:37.853 --> 05:40.128
Oh, my God!

05:40.213 --> 05:42.522
-  I found the weapon.
- That was quick.

05:42.613 --> 05:48.609
Tapered, inch and a half wide with a hilt and
a quillon. The cannelure is quite distinctive.

05:48.693 --> 05:52.208
- That's the Gormogon knife.
- The serial killer?

05:52.293 --> 05:57.572
Which is why the symbol looks so familiar.
I've seen it on a tapestry, in the vault.

05:58.253 --> 06:02.132
So this is the famous vault
where the violinist was murdered and eaten.

06:02.213 --> 06:05.523
We transported everything from the bank
to the Jeffersonian.

06:05.613 --> 06:09.242
So if you touch anything,
you put it back exactly the way it was.

06:09.333 --> 06:12.211
Oh, awesome.
The Widow's Son sculpture?

06:12.293 --> 06:17.845
It's a silver skeleton which is replaced, piece
by piece, with bones from murder victims.

06:17.933 --> 06:22.484
And all of the relics, including that skeleton,
can be traced to the Gormogons.

06:22.573 --> 06:28.125
A 17th-century Anti-Masonic group.
Supposed to be extinct.

06:28.213 --> 06:35.005
- How many victims?
- At least five unidentified, plus the violinist.

06:35.093 --> 06:37.653
That is the actual
violinist's pinkie.

06:37.733 --> 06:41.203
Obviously Gormogon sent you
his kneecaps to continue his work.

06:41.293 --> 06:44.251
We are not fitting those kneecaps
onto this skeleton.

06:44.333 --> 06:46.927
You'll find something special
about them.

06:47.013 --> 06:51.803
- OK, this tapestry here is off somehow.
-  Off?

06:51.893 --> 06:56.967
Well, don't look at me. My idea of art
is a half-naked woman on the side of a van.

06:57.053 --> 07:03.049
- That's interesting.
- No, it's not interesting, Sweets. It was a joke.

07:07.373 --> 07:12.845
- OK, what's the matter?
- Russ's girlfriend Amy came to see me.

07:12.933 --> 07:16.892
Her daughter's sick. She's looking for Russ.
I said Dad may know where he is.

07:16.973 --> 07:20.170
Russ is a fugitive
and a witness in your dad's murder trial.

07:20.253 --> 07:23.131
- Amy knows.
- He won't come back for your niece's cough.

07:23.213 --> 07:26.603
She's not my niece.
And it's not a cough, it's cystic fibrosis.

07:26.693 --> 07:30.891
Dr Brennan, Missing Persons sent over
dental records from middle-aged men.

07:30.973 --> 07:33.168
- I checked against the victim.
- Get a hit?

07:33.253 --> 07:37.724
Father Douglas Cooper, vicar general
to the archbishop of Washington, DC.

07:37.813 --> 07:42.204
Sweets was right about the kneecaps.
This guy would've been a world-class kneeler.

07:42.293 --> 07:46.491
Saying he's a whizz at psychology
is like saying he's good at mind-reading.

07:46.573 --> 07:48.962
- It's guesswork.
- I'm bringing Sweets in.

07:49.053 --> 07:52.409
- You make fun of him.
- Only when he messes with our heads.

07:52.493 --> 07:56.725
- He was right about the knees.
- Figure out how they excised the kneecaps.

07:56.813 --> 07:59.088
Yes, Dr Brennan.

07:59.173 --> 08:01.289
- What?
- You just dismissed Zack.

08:01.373 --> 08:05.161
- No, I didn't.
- Don't get me wrong. I liked it.

08:06.613 --> 08:10.686
- Thank you for coming, Archbishop Wallace.
- You've found my vicar general?

08:10.773 --> 08:15.608
- Yes, Your Holiness.
- Monsignor. Or Steve.

08:15.693 --> 08:18.048
- So how did Doug die?
- Well, Steve...

08:18.133 --> 08:19.725
- Bones.
- He said call him Steve.

08:19.813 --> 08:21.531
Monsignor.

08:21.613 --> 08:27.882
Father Cooper was stabbed to death
as a part of a series of cannibalistic murders.

08:27.973 --> 08:31.409
A series...
of cannibalistic murders?

08:31.493 --> 08:35.280
We're still trying to find out
what they had in common.

08:35.373 --> 08:41.049
He was a quiet man. He'd been on sabbatical
for six months. He was writing a book.

08:41.133 --> 08:43.283
- About?
- Early Christianity.

08:43.373 --> 08:46.843
Its ties to paganism.
Esoteric stuff.

08:47.293 --> 08:50.808
- Somebody <i>ate</i> Doug?
- Just a part of him.

08:52.333 --> 08:54.972
A lovely, decent man.

08:55.053 --> 08:59.922
Humble,
dedicated to serving others... Oh!

09:00.013 --> 09:02.732
Bad choice of words
given that someone ate him.

09:02.813 --> 09:05.088
Just a part of him.

09:05.173 --> 09:08.768
There's too much evil in the world.
God forgive me, but...

09:08.853 --> 09:12.562
sometimes I wonder
if I'm little more than a Band-Aid.

09:12.653 --> 09:13.972
Amen, Monsignor. Amen.

09:18.969 --> 09:23.918
These ligature marks suggest the victim's
wrists and ankles were bound with wire.

09:24.009 --> 09:27.001
There are indications of dislocation
in both shoulders.

09:27.089 --> 09:30.445
- He was hung by his arms for a while.
- Probably.

09:30.529 --> 09:33.123
- In the same position as the sculpture?
- Possible.

09:33.209 --> 09:36.087
Angela identified
a figure on the tapestry.

09:36.169 --> 09:40.685
Barabbas, a murderer who was condemned
to death in New Testament Jerusalem.

09:40.769 --> 09:44.887
The Gormogons believe his descendants
started the first secret societies.

09:44.969 --> 09:47.688
To the Gormogons,
Barabbas is an enduring symbol

09:47.769 --> 09:51.079
of all that is backwards,
upside down or inside out.

09:51.169 --> 09:54.320
So if you find his figure
on a Gormogon relic...

09:54.409 --> 09:57.401
It's a sign to interpret it backwards
or upside down.

09:57.489 --> 10:00.845
The numbers on the tapestry
are a simple alpha-numeric code.

10:00.929 --> 10:02.840
Each number corresponds with a letter.
"Civitas Capitolium."

10:04.929 --> 10:05.918
Which means "Capitol City".

10:09.806 --> 10:13.594
- The pentagram over the White House.
-  The compass and square.

10:13.686 --> 10:16.803
The point of the compass
is over the US Capitol building.

10:16.886 --> 10:19.195
Here's where
Barabbas really kicks in.

10:19.286 --> 10:23.677
The presence of Barabbas on this
means backwards and upside down.

10:23.766 --> 10:28.203
So when the compass is inverted,
it points to some very interesting landmarks.

10:28.286 --> 10:32.802
- The bank, where we found the vault.
- The place Cooper's body was dumped.

10:32.886 --> 10:36.401
The highway overpass
off of which Gavin Nichols' head was thrown.

10:36.486 --> 10:39.637
- What's there?
- An old mansion. It's now a nursing home.

10:39.726 --> 10:43.514
- And this falls very precisely.
-  What's that?

10:43.606 --> 10:47.758
-  A mausoleum at the cemetery.
- You want to look inside?

10:47.846 --> 10:50.406
Hell, yeah, I do.

10:50.486 --> 10:54.877
This mausoleum's been here since the 1800s.
It's paid for by a trust.

10:54.966 --> 10:58.402
Director of the cemetery
thinks no one's been here for a century.

10:58.486 --> 11:01.398
- This better be good.
- Look. "Pater mortuus."

11:01.486 --> 11:04.956
- It means "dead father".
- You know Latin? Dude!

11:05.046 --> 11:07.514
Altar boy.

11:10.366 --> 11:13.119
- Got a key?
- Yeah. Brought my own.

11:14.086 --> 11:15.963
- Wait, wait. Wait, wait.
- What?

11:16.046 --> 11:20.881
- Can I do it?
- No. You don't let me play with your bugs.

11:29.166 --> 11:32.363
Oh, great. Another one.

11:33.206 --> 11:37.358
Booth, this one's
completely made of bone.

11:53.526 --> 11:55.994
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:57.206 --> 12:00.357
- How's Hayley doing?
- Dr Goetz is a godsend.

12:00.446 --> 12:05.122
I don't know how to thank you.
Oh, Hayley, sweetie, that's Dr Brennan.

12:05.206 --> 12:07.959
- Temperance.
- Another doctor?

12:08.046 --> 12:12.198
- Oh, not that kind.
- Temperance is Russ's sister.

12:12.286 --> 12:15.119
Couldn't you call him
and tell him to come home?

12:15.206 --> 12:19.119
- It's complicated.
- Here, eat your Jell-o, sweetie.

12:21.886 --> 12:27.324
I tried to get into the jail to see your father.
They wouldn't let me in. I'm not a relative.

12:27.406 --> 12:31.365
Russ is a fugitive. The minute
he comes back to DC, they'll toss him in jail.

12:31.446 --> 12:34.324
- Well, how would anyone know?
- I work with the FBI.

12:34.406 --> 12:40.276
You don't have to be in it. All you have to do
is ask your father to get a message to Russ.

12:42.566 --> 12:48.038
You look my baby in the face and tell her she
can't see her father cos you're mad at yours.

12:55.766 --> 13:00.078
- What have we got?
- So far, I've identified 18 different victims.

13:00.166 --> 13:03.681
And I'm not done.
All bones show cannibalism indicators.

13:03.766 --> 13:08.681
- This tibia appears to be over 50 years old.
- You mean the victim's over 50?

13:08.766 --> 13:11.917
What I mean is the victim was killed
over 50 years ago.

13:12.006 --> 13:16.761
That would suggest that Gormogon's, what?
A minimum of 70 years old?

13:16.846 --> 13:21.476
The teeth marks on this bone
do not match Gormogon's teeth.

13:21.566 --> 13:25.002
My God. We have another cannibal out there?
An old one?

13:25.086 --> 13:28.920
The gemstone you found
in Father Cooper's chest is violet jade.

13:29.006 --> 13:32.316
- The dirt contains sepiolite.
- And we're happy about this?

13:32.406 --> 13:36.035
Both violet jade and sepiolite
are found only in a region of Turkey.

13:36.126 --> 13:41.200
The Anatolia region, to be exact.
Legendary site of the Garden of Eden.

13:41.286 --> 13:45.165
And this comes from the vault.
Guess what? It's the same stuff.

13:45.246 --> 13:49.285
- Run the new dentals against the database.
- What do you want me to do?

13:49.366 --> 13:54.565
Uh, be on the lookout for
a face-eating cannibal who uses a walker?

14:00.086 --> 14:03.476
- There's my girl.
- I, um...

14:03.566 --> 14:05.921
I brought you a coffee cake,
but they took it.

14:06.006 --> 14:12.844
Ah, well, I'm not into coffee cake. These days
all my meals are prepared by men in hairnets.

14:16.926 --> 14:23.035
I'm glad you came. I was thinking about the
places I've been that are worse than prison.

14:23.126 --> 14:27.165
El Salvador, for example. And that two weeks
I spent in a shipping container.

14:27.246 --> 14:32.525
- Disney World. You hated Disney World.
- I thought I kept that from you kids.

14:32.606 --> 14:35.723
No. I was six. Russ was ten.
It was pouring rain.

14:36.166 --> 14:39.044
Mickey sneezed so hard
his head popped off.

14:39.126 --> 14:42.118
I think I like prison better.

14:49.006 --> 14:52.442
- Dad, I'm here about Russ.
- He's fine. Don't worry about Russ.

14:52.526 --> 14:56.963
The woman he lived with,
the kids he was raising, they need him home.

14:57.046 --> 14:59.685
Russ sends Amy and the girls
money every month.

14:59.766 --> 15:04.157
The younger child, Hayley,
is really sick.

15:04.246 --> 15:07.795
- She's asking for him.
- How sick?

15:07.886 --> 15:13.995
I'm here, Dad. I'm asking you to tell Russ.
Let him make up his own mind what to do.

15:14.086 --> 15:17.965
If he comes back to DC,
Russ is gonna end up in here with me.

15:18.046 --> 15:20.276
He won't do that.
He's scared of jail.

15:20.366 --> 15:23.164
He'll come
if you ask him to.

15:24.766 --> 15:28.156
You look more like your mother
every day.

15:31.086 --> 15:33.122
I've gotta go.

15:34.206 --> 15:37.198
Well, come back soon.

15:37.286 --> 15:39.880
And thanks for the coffee cake.

15:45.926 --> 15:49.760
I found the same symbol that was
mailed to Dr Brennan on this tapestry.

15:49.846 --> 15:52.280
- It looks like a bunch of tarot cards.
- OK.

15:52.366 --> 15:56.484
The Architect,
the Martyr, the Orator,

15:56.566 --> 16:00.161
the Musician,
the Bishop, the Corruptor...

16:00.246 --> 16:02.555
- Whoa! That's it.
- What?

16:02.646 --> 16:06.400
- Gavin Nichols was the Musician.
- Father Cooper was a bishop.

16:06.486 --> 16:10.274
- He's doing it in order.
- What's next?

16:10.366 --> 16:13.642
-  The Corruptor.
- So the next victim is a corruptor.

16:13.726 --> 16:17.605
So let's call up every porn kingpin
and drug dealer in the country.

16:17.686 --> 16:21.122
Tell 'em to look out for a lunatic
holding a knife and fork.

16:21.206 --> 16:25.836
Dude, you're being way too literal.
These icons extend from the 1600s.

16:25.926 --> 16:30.317
A corruptor would mean a heretic,
like, say, a pretender to the throne.

16:30.406 --> 16:32.636
- Why are you here?
- You wanted to see me.

16:32.726 --> 16:37.720
- Not see. Talk. On the telephone.
- Interesting what people say unwittingly.

16:37.806 --> 16:41.765
I'm totally into the Gormogon file.
In my opinion, you're looking for a duo.

16:41.846 --> 16:44.565
- How did you get the file?
- Booth.

16:44.646 --> 16:49.561
- You gave him the case file?
- Time out. He came up with the duo thing.

16:49.646 --> 16:53.002
We found another Widow's Son skeleton.
This one's complete.

16:53.086 --> 16:56.840
The teeth marks
suggest two cannibals.

16:56.926 --> 16:59.645
Really? Awesome!
It's like the Sith Lords.

16:59.726 --> 17:03.036
- There's always only two of them.
- Did you just <i>Star Wars</i> us?

17:03.126 --> 17:07.483
In the parlance of the 17th century,
it's a master-and-apprentice situation.

17:07.566 --> 17:11.115
Each master must create a sculpture
while training an apprentice.

17:11.205 --> 17:16.040
When it's complete, the master retires, the
apprentice becomes a master, starts his own.

17:16.126 --> 17:20.243
- So Gormogon used to be the apprentice.
- Now he's the master.

17:20.326 --> 17:23.796
How does me saying no
translate to bringing Sweets in?

17:23.886 --> 17:26.798
Both victims lost their fathers
at a young age.

17:26.886 --> 17:29.354
Widows' sons.
Coincidence? I think not.

17:29.446 --> 17:31.835
We arrested Gormogon's apprentice.

17:31.926 --> 17:34.121
Yeah.
He killed himself.

17:34.206 --> 17:37.482
Point of investigation.
How do masters find apprentices?

17:37.566 --> 17:39.955
- Not craigslist. I checked.
-  Booth.

17:40.046 --> 17:44.358
I bet you two free sessions
that the master has access to at-risk children.

17:44.446 --> 17:48.075
- Kid's got chops.
- But... Anything else?

17:48.166 --> 17:53.559
Yeah. It must be killing him that you
have this. This is his whole reason for living.

17:53.646 --> 17:56.114
You might be able to find
some way to use that.

17:56.206 --> 17:59.721
Wait till you hear.
Father Cooper took a trip to Turkey last year.

17:59.806 --> 18:04.084
- The Anatolian region?
- Mm-hm. Gavin Nichols was on the same trip.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.396
The Bishop and the Musician.

18:06.486 --> 18:10.445
- What about a Corruptor?
- The trip was arranged by a lobbyist.

18:10.526 --> 18:12.164
Oh, that's a total pretender
to the throne.

18:18.442 --> 18:20.478
Got time
to talk to a lobbyist?

18:20.562 --> 18:22.598
My life is in danger
because I went to Turkey?

18:22.682 --> 18:26.470
- Two of the men you travelled with are dead.
- Their faces were eaten off.

18:26.562 --> 18:29.395
This is Washington, DC.
That happens all the time.

18:29.482 --> 18:32.440
Mr Porter, are you a member
of any fraternal order?

18:32.522 --> 18:35.434
- Masons, Odd Fellows?
- Ku Klux Klan?

18:36.722 --> 18:40.681
You see these cuff links?
Each one cost more than you make in a year.

18:40.762 --> 18:43.913
I own a 100ft yacht, two mansions
and a Swiss ski chalet.

18:44.002 --> 18:47.995
I have these things because my associates
trust me to do what they ask -

18:48.082 --> 18:50.516
- to keep my mouth shut.
- I'll take that as a yes.

18:50.602 --> 18:54.072
- You're with the Knights of Columbus.
- Says so in your résumé.

18:54.162 --> 18:56.357
Next I'm gonna show you my watch.

18:56.442 --> 19:00.993
My Uncle Stan is a member of the
Knights of Columbus. What is the big deal?

19:01.082 --> 19:05.155
You went to Turkey with the Knights
to the mythical site of the Garden of Eden.

19:05.242 --> 19:10.839
There's a cannibal with something against
men who do good works in their community?

19:10.922 --> 19:15.518
The guy we're after, he thinks that the
Knights of Columbus is an evil secret society.

19:15.602 --> 19:18.275
- That's crazy.
- He's finally catching on.

19:18.362 --> 19:21.877
- Your life is in danger.
- Why me? There were 40 guys on that trip.

19:21.962 --> 19:24.681
How old were you
when your father died?

19:24.762 --> 19:29.677
- Six. What does that have to do with this?
- You lost your father <i>and</i> you're a corruptor.

19:29.762 --> 19:34.233
OK. You want to talk to me,
you do it through my lawyer.

19:34.802 --> 19:37.680
Listen. Mr Porter,
we are just trying to help here.

19:37.762 --> 19:42.438
The FBI is investigating influence peddling.
I am one of your targets.

19:42.522 --> 19:45.673
Somebody eating the Knights?
How stupid do you think I am?

19:45.762 --> 19:49.675
Right now?
Very, very stupid.

19:49.762 --> 19:53.232
- OK. You didn't have to call him corrupt.
- Why?

19:53.322 --> 19:55.438
Why? Because obviously he is.

19:56.242 --> 19:57.595
- Agent Booth?
- Yeah?

19:57.682 --> 20:00.276
There's someone here to see you.

20:00.362 --> 20:03.718
- Where's Hayley?
- Russ! You came to the FBI?

20:03.802 --> 20:06.635
- That was the deal.
- Wow. This gets better. All right.

20:06.722 --> 20:11.477
- You're under arrest. You know the drill.
- You lied? You said he wouldn't arrest me.

20:11.562 --> 20:14.599
- I never said that.
- I should've known not to trust you.

20:14.682 --> 20:18.197
- Russ, I swear.
- I want to see my stepdaughter.

20:32.720 --> 20:35.757
- Hi, honey.
-  Russ, I knew you'd come.

20:40.920 --> 20:45.391
- Here, come here. Look who's here.
- You making funny faces? Huh?

20:48.840 --> 20:51.070
Thank you for coming, Russ.

20:52.840 --> 20:56.037
- Thank you, Booth.
- This never happened. Don't thank me.

20:56.120 --> 21:01.911
As far as the Bureau's concerned,
I caught him here 15 minutes from now.

21:02.920 --> 21:05.115
Thank you, Booth.

21:08.920 --> 21:11.878
Just don't tell anyone.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.759
You told Russ
I said Booth wouldn't arrest him.

21:16.840 --> 21:20.389
I couldn't turn him over to you
and put you in a quandary with Booth.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.948
- I did it this way for you.
- Dad!

21:23.040 --> 21:27.318
What? Booth busted him? That hard-ass.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.595
- Brennan?
- <i>Dr Brennan, it's me, Zack.</i>

21:29.680 --> 21:31.716
<i>I found something</i>
<i>you should see.</i>

21:31.800 --> 21:34.473
Why are you being
such a hard-ass on my kid, Booth?

21:34.560 --> 21:38.155
- <i>Who's that?</i>
- Nobody. It's not Booth.

21:38.240 --> 21:43.553
Nobody can trust you. But now you're making
it so Russ and I can't trust each other either.

21:43.640 --> 21:50.273
He came back. He hugged his little girl, OK?
So far, things are working out great.

21:50.360 --> 21:54.273
I'm here for you.
And a lot of dads aren't.

22:05.480 --> 22:07.550
That's true, Dad.

22:16.640 --> 22:19.029
- What's going on?
- Can you turn the lights on?

22:19.120 --> 22:22.556
I was down here helping Angela decode
when I noticed the mirrors.

22:22.640 --> 22:25.200
- What mirrors?
- Put these on so you can see.

22:25.280 --> 22:28.192
- This better be good.
- I'm surprised no one noticed.

22:28.280 --> 22:33.149
They're everywhere. Different kinds, sizes,
placed seemingly at random around the vault.

22:33.240 --> 22:35.879
But I have overdeveloped
spatial reasoning.

22:35.960 --> 22:39.430
Things that appear random to some people
appear deliberate to me.

22:39.520 --> 22:43.149
- Zack, just get on with it.
- Watch this.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.638
Oh.

22:50.720 --> 22:53.917
- Wanna see where it ends?
-  Yes.

22:55.120 --> 22:56.348
Ow!

23:02.000 --> 23:06.278
From that spot, you'd be able to see
every corner of the vault.

23:06.360 --> 23:09.113
- Shh.
-  I don't get it. What does it mean?

23:09.200 --> 23:13.239
Gormogon has been watching us
this whole time.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.070
Tech guys,
they did a sensor sweep.

23:23.160 --> 23:26.436
That eye is broadcasting a signal,
both audio and video.

23:26.520 --> 23:30.479
It's white-light activated
so it probably wasn't triggered by the laser.

23:30.560 --> 23:34.189
- What do we do?
- What Sweets said. Use it against Gormogon.

23:34.280 --> 23:36.669
- How?
- Haven't got a clue.

23:36.760 --> 23:42.232
If we fool him into thinking we're transferring
the sculpture, he might try to grab it.

23:42.320 --> 23:45.471
- Nah.
- No, if he wants it then he'll try to steal it.

23:45.560 --> 23:48.028
- No.
- Why not?

23:48.120 --> 23:52.318
Because I didn't think of it.
It's a great idea, but if you're gonna sell it,

23:52.400 --> 23:57.793
you're gonna have to put Father Cooper's
kneecaps in the silver skeleton.

23:58.320 --> 24:03.189
-  I do this under extreme protest.
- The truck will be here any minute.

24:03.280 --> 24:05.669
Who knows about this?

24:05.760 --> 24:09.992
Just you and me, Bones. Not even the driver
knows what we're transporting.

24:10.080 --> 24:14.358
The MRI at Bethesda will tell us
if Gormogon hid anything within the bones.

24:14.440 --> 24:18.353
- Like what?
- I don't know. That's why we need the MRI.

24:18.440 --> 24:20.476
- Shh.
-  What?

24:20.560 --> 24:24.917
- You don't have to scream. I'm right here.
- Right. OK.

24:25.000 --> 24:29.152
- Are you done? We're kinda on a schedule.
-  Yes! I'm done.

24:29.240 --> 24:33.870
Now we can load it onto a truck
and take it to Bethesda.

24:42.160 --> 24:46.950
<i>Everybody keep</i>
<i>their distance. I don't want to spook this guy.</i>

24:47.040 --> 24:50.555
- I have a question.
- No, you can't drive. I'm the taxi driver.

24:50.640 --> 24:53.677
- Passengers don't sit up front.
- You're not a passenger.

24:53.760 --> 24:57.992
You're a trainee
and I'm training you how to drive a taxicab.

25:02.680 --> 25:06.036
OK, all units, be advised.
I got a motorcycle with no plates.

25:09.640 --> 25:10.789
- Whoa.
- Easy.

25:10.880 --> 25:13.155
- Get down!
- What? Why?

25:33.320 --> 25:36.278
Bones? Aah!

25:37.520 --> 25:39.317
Bones?

25:41.880 --> 25:43.871
Don't move.

25:50.720 --> 25:52.358
Bones.

25:52.440 --> 25:55.079
OK. Put your arm
underneath my shoulder.

25:55.160 --> 26:00.234
Come on, you ready?
On three. One, two, three.

26:00.320 --> 26:03.949
- I'm OK. I'm OK.
- Get over here.

26:05.040 --> 26:09.272
- Paramedics are on their way.
- He knew because I was sitting up front.

26:09.360 --> 26:13.194
- No, it was because of your bad acting.
- Back at the vault? I was good.

26:13.280 --> 26:16.955
- No, you were loud, overacting.
- You shouldn't have shushed me.

26:17.040 --> 26:19.235
- Who's got the motorcycle?
- We lost it.

26:19.320 --> 26:22.915
- Dammit! Wait. What about the truck?
- It's fine.

26:23.000 --> 26:27.516
He knew the truck was a decoy. He wasn't
after the skeleton. He was trying to kill us.

26:27.600 --> 26:29.556
What?

26:29.640 --> 26:32.791
Oh, all right, easy.
I got it.

26:34.240 --> 26:37.357
- What is that?
- Oh, it's...

26:37.440 --> 26:42.468
It's a human tooth.
He put human teeth in his bomb for shrapnel.

26:42.560 --> 26:48.112
Bones, he was trying to kill us because
we know his next target. The Corruptor.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.156
- That lobbyist.
- I want to come!

26:50.240 --> 26:52.959
Stay right there!

26:58.800 --> 27:03.157
-  You're gonna be okay, ma'am.
- I'm fine. Fine. Flesh wound.

27:12.640 --> 27:16.235
- You believe me now?
- He ran downstairs. He had a knife.

27:16.320 --> 27:18.470
He had a knife.

27:47.000 --> 27:51.312
Hey! It's over! Drop him!

27:51.400 --> 27:53.277
- Put the kid down.
- Put me down!

27:53.360 --> 27:55.510
- Put him down!
- Aargh!

28:23.720 --> 28:27.838
It's OK. It's all right.
It's all right. It's over. OK?

28:27.920 --> 28:31.674
OK. All right, buddy. OK.

28:35.240 --> 28:37.629
The Gormogons
started out as good guys.

28:37.720 --> 28:42.032
In the 1600s, malignant manipulations
of secret societies like the Illuminati,

28:42.120 --> 28:45.829
the Carbonari, the Masons,
the tong, were starting to be felt.

28:45.920 --> 28:50.948
The Gormogons believed that humanity
should be free of these pernicious influences.

28:51.040 --> 28:55.556
- Good guys.
- So you feel sympathy for Gormogon?

28:55.640 --> 29:01.033
There are secret societies working today.
It's naive to think otherwise.

29:02.400 --> 29:06.154
- You think I'm paranoid.
- Yeah.

29:06.240 --> 29:09.198
The question is how paranoid?

29:10.240 --> 29:12.310
Zack says
there are over 30 victims

29:12.400 --> 29:18.270
in the skeleton created by Gormogon
and his master, who has gotta be in his 80s.

29:18.360 --> 29:24.390
We know there are seven in the one created
by Gormogon and his dead apprentice,

29:24.480 --> 29:26.516
including...

29:26.600 --> 29:29.114
the violinist and the priest.

29:29.200 --> 29:33.273
Now, my point of view,
he's going after the Knights of Columbus.

29:33.360 --> 29:36.432
Gormogon is nuts.

29:37.160 --> 29:39.469
Dr Sweets?

29:39.560 --> 29:43.394
Dead apprentice.
Gormogon needs a new apprentice.

29:43.920 --> 29:48.710
He may have already found one.
We're looking for a kid in his teens.

29:49.400 --> 29:52.073
- Tempe, what happened to you?
- I got blown up.

29:52.160 --> 29:55.152
I never told Dad
you should turn yourself in to Booth.

29:55.240 --> 29:58.596
You would've told Booth anyway.
What do you mean, "blown up"?

29:58.680 --> 30:02.878
It's a case, Russ. It's my job.
We're trying to put a bad guy away.

30:02.960 --> 30:06.589
You mean in here?
With other bad guys, like me and Dad?

30:06.680 --> 30:10.150
There are levels of bad guy.
You're not even on the first level.

30:10.240 --> 30:13.073
Why do I feel like
you just called me a sissy?

30:13.160 --> 30:18.234
I wanted you to hear it from me, Russ. Dad
lied. I never told him it was safe to come back.

30:18.320 --> 30:20.914
- I had to come back, Tempe!
- For Hayley.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.117
Yes. But they are gonna put me away
after my parole hearing.

30:24.200 --> 30:28.512
It's not just that you violated parole.
They think you know about Dad's case.

30:28.600 --> 30:31.592
I don't!

30:31.680 --> 30:36.356
Nobody believes anybody in this family.
Am I like him? A liar? Not worthy of trust?

30:36.440 --> 30:38.590
No. Don't say that.

30:39.600 --> 30:42.239
I am just like him. I am.

30:42.320 --> 30:45.312
- I had a family. I left them.
- You haven't killed anyone.

30:45.400 --> 30:51.157
That's the most reassuring that you can be?
"Congratulations on never killing anyone."

30:52.880 --> 30:57.237
Being reassuring
has never been my strong suit.

30:58.280 --> 31:00.475
Levels of bad, right?

31:02.240 --> 31:05.437
- And I'm a sissy.
- It's a good thing, Russ.

31:07.120 --> 31:12.558
Thanks for helping Hayley.
I love that little girl like she was my own.

31:12.640 --> 31:16.633
- You believe <i>that,</i> don't you?
- Yeah, Russ.

31:16.720 --> 31:18.915
I believe that.

31:23.120 --> 31:27.511
Normal person gets blown to hell,
they go home, pour a glass of wine, watch TV.

31:27.600 --> 31:30.273
It's worth something
that Russ turned himself in.

31:30.360 --> 31:33.318
Bumping into Booth at hospital
is not turning himself in.

31:33.400 --> 31:36.278
- That's not what happened.
- It's what Booth says.

31:36.360 --> 31:39.796
No, I convinced Booth
to let him go see Hayley at the hospital.

31:39.880 --> 31:41.871
I did not hear that.

31:41.960 --> 31:47.478
Russ turned himself in. I convinced
Booth to let him go see Hayley at the hospital.

31:47.560 --> 31:50.836
Do I have this straight?
You're a genius?

31:50.920 --> 31:53.992
An honest-to-goodness,
dyed-in-the-wool genius?

31:54.080 --> 31:57.868
- Yes.
- Dr Brennan, I like you, on and off.

31:57.960 --> 32:00.918
But your brother is a material witness
in my murder case.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.037
I cannot recommend
that he be set free.

32:04.120 --> 32:08.193
- Please?
- Oh, well... now that you've said please.

32:08.280 --> 32:11.078
- Are you being sarcastic?
- Yes!

32:11.680 --> 32:15.719
Best I can do is arrange for you to speak
at your brother's parole hearing.

32:15.800 --> 32:20.430
Looking the way you do, maybe the judge
will feel sorry and let him go.

32:22.920 --> 32:27.471
These are the marks left by Gormogon's teeth.
I've reverse-engineered a dental set.

32:27.560 --> 32:31.314
So, this is what the front plate
of Gormogon's teeth looks like.

32:31.400 --> 32:32.628
Top and bottom.

32:35.438 --> 32:36.632
These are the teeth
from the bomb.

32:43.717 --> 32:47.630
It's a match. That was Gormogon's tooth
lodged in my shoulder.

32:47.717 --> 32:50.151
The tooth in your shoulder
was chipped.

32:50.237 --> 32:54.310
- All the teeth, almost a full set, were chipped.
- Due to the explosion?

32:54.397 --> 32:59.517
No. These marks here were made
by common, hardware-store pliers.

32:59.597 --> 33:03.954
- He pulled out his own teeth?
- I don't know. They were removed with pliers.

33:04.037 --> 33:08.155
That's what happened. Gormogon pulled out
all his teeth one by one with pliers

33:08.237 --> 33:10.592
and put them in a bomb.

33:10.677 --> 33:13.145
Booth was right.

33:13.237 --> 33:15.432
He meant to kill us.

33:18.157 --> 33:20.352
Symbolically, he wanted to bite you.

33:20.437 --> 33:23.031
Symbolically?! He literally bit me.

33:23.117 --> 33:27.747
I've come to believe that the Widow's Son
sculpture is an effort to recreate Adam.

33:27.837 --> 33:30.715
Oh, Adam and Eve!
How did you come up with that one?

33:30.797 --> 33:34.312
The Garden of Eden. Plus,
the notion that when Adam was cast out,

33:34.397 --> 33:39.027
he was disowned by God. He became
the ultimate rejected son - fatherless.

33:39.117 --> 33:41.267
Why recreate Adam?

33:41.357 --> 33:43.507
Obviously these people are wacko.

33:44.517 --> 33:47.236
No, no, no, no.
Sweets, you see,

33:47.317 --> 33:51.026
answers like that is exactly why
Bones hates psychology.

33:51.117 --> 33:53.950
Right, well,
use what's useful, reject the rest.

33:54.037 --> 33:56.995
Yeah.
OK, thanks, Sweets.

33:57.077 --> 34:00.990
$200,000 in student loans,
and the kid comes up with "wacko"!

34:01.077 --> 34:03.033
- Maybe Sweets is right.
- What?

34:03.117 --> 34:07.508
These boys, these young men,
they have no fathers.

34:07.597 --> 34:11.795
What, so they become apprentices
to a serial-killing cannibal?

34:11.877 --> 34:14.949
Or <i>they</i> become serial-killing cannibals.

34:15.036 --> 34:18.871
Oh, yeah! Right, I see
what's going on inside your head.

34:18.956 --> 34:22.154
- What?
- My dad wasn't so great, but I came out OK.

34:22.237 --> 34:25.547
No. You've killed a lot of people.
You'll probably kill more.

34:25.637 --> 34:27.036
- Unbelievable!
- What?

34:27.117 --> 34:30.029
- Did you hear what you just said?
- It's the truth.

34:30.117 --> 34:33.553
The truth?! How about a little kindness,
some consideration?

34:33.637 --> 34:37.596
I'm sorry.
You're a good man.

34:38.237 --> 34:41.592
- You're being sarcastic.
- I don't do sarcasm.

34:41.677 --> 34:43.871
The point is,
Russ is going to be fine.

34:43.956 --> 34:45.913
Who said anything about Russ?

34:45.996 --> 34:50.353
Listen, Bones, your father is not
the normal guy, but he loves you.

34:50.437 --> 34:55.431
He loves both of you. And that is 90 per cent
of what a son needs to hear from his father.

34:55.516 --> 34:58.395
- Really?
- Well, maybe about 95 per cent.

34:58.477 --> 35:02.993
- Where are you getting this data?
- The point is Russ is going to be OK.

35:03.077 --> 35:05.068
I know he will.

35:05.157 --> 35:07.387
Will you speak on his behalf
at the hearing?

35:07.477 --> 35:08.592
- Nope.
- Why not?

35:08.677 --> 35:13.705
He broke parole, and I'm not his dad.
He's got to stand up and own his mistakes.

35:16.197 --> 35:19.872
I was photographing the skeleton
in preparation for taking it apart

35:19.957 --> 35:23.506
when I noticed this on a rib.

35:24.717 --> 35:26.594
- 1026? What is it?
- It's a number.

35:28.596 --> 35:31.235
- No, Zack. Cam meant what does it mean?
- Is it code?

35:31.316 --> 35:36.344
Could be an ordinal index automata. I'd start
a solution, but it would extend into infinity.

35:36.436 --> 35:39.348
- How long would that take?
- Forever. Obviously.

35:39.436 --> 35:43.668
- How's about that alpha-numeric business?
- Uh, JBF.

35:43.756 --> 35:46.873
- Meaningless.
- No, wait a minute. I got it.

35:46.956 --> 35:49.914
- What?
- He's an artist. He's finished something.

35:49.996 --> 35:53.272
And it's terrible,
but to him, this is a piece of art.

35:53.356 --> 35:56.553
- It's a signature.
- 1026 is a number, not a name.

35:56.636 --> 36:01.073
- No, I'm telling you. This is a signature.
- The vault is a museum of the Gormogons.

36:01.156 --> 36:05.434
- An archive.
- Why don't we look in safe-deposit box 1026?

36:05.516 --> 36:09.828
- They're rigged to blow up when opened.
- Oh, I solved that one. In my head.

36:09.916 --> 36:13.033
- While having my Cup-a-Soup.
- Wow.

36:14.676 --> 36:19.386
I'm smothering the phosphorous with argon,
thus giving Booth time to reach in with tongs

36:19.476 --> 36:22.115
to remove whatever's in the box
before it ignites.

36:22.196 --> 36:24.585
- Why me?
- You have the fastest reflexes.

36:24.676 --> 36:26.712
- Fine. You can pull the tray.
- Fine.

36:26.796 --> 36:30.675
- Exactly how far back should I be standing?
- Ready?

36:30.756 --> 36:34.385
Door. Tray. Lid. Tongs.

36:35.316 --> 36:37.625
Whoa!

36:38.116 --> 36:40.266
- Did he get it?
- Can't you see?

36:40.356 --> 36:45.430
- Not for another three to five minutes.
- It's a key with a barcode on it.

36:46.836 --> 36:50.465
You called me to the FBI
because you found a key to my office?

36:50.556 --> 36:52.945
We accessed
the information in the barcode.

36:53.036 --> 36:56.153
It's the key to your office
in the social services building.

36:56.236 --> 37:01.105
- That's not the key to my office.
- Room 1026, department of social services.

37:01.196 --> 37:04.950
Nobody's used a key like that since the '70s.
It was before my time.

37:05.036 --> 37:07.755
Has the office
always belonged to social services?

37:07.836 --> 37:11.272
Yes. Back then it was dealing with
foster care and group homes.

37:11.356 --> 37:14.985
Sweets is right. That'd be a great place
to recruit disturbed boys.

37:15.076 --> 37:18.512
Recruit for what?

37:18.996 --> 37:23.148
Um, it's just that that man
that was in that office is a bit of a legend.

37:23.236 --> 37:26.114
- He helped a lot of kids.
- What was his name?

37:26.196 --> 37:28.915
Arthur Graves.
He's retired now.

37:28.996 --> 37:35.026
He wouldn't happen to live in a nursing home
that used to be a mansion, would he?

37:35.356 --> 37:39.429
Mr Graves has been here for five years.
In a wheelchair for the last four.

37:39.516 --> 37:42.235
Sweet guy.
A little particular about what he eats.

37:42.316 --> 37:45.035
- You got no idea.
- Beg your pardon?

37:45.116 --> 37:50.031
- Uh, what's wrong with Mr Graves?
- Alzheimer's. He's gotten pretty bad.

37:50.116 --> 37:53.028
- Is he lucid?
- He comes and goes.

37:53.116 --> 37:54.788
Hey, Arthur?

37:54.876 --> 37:59.711
- Some nice people here to see you.
- Hey, Mr Graves. FBI Special Agent Booth.

37:59.796 --> 38:03.505
Listen, we got a court order here
to get a dental imprint from you.

38:03.596 --> 38:06.429
Mr Graves,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

38:06.516 --> 38:10.509
I just need you
to bite down on this for me.

38:10.596 --> 38:13.030
Oh! Hey, hey!

38:13.116 --> 38:17.428
- Sorry. I think you frightened him.
- How did he lose his teeth?

38:17.516 --> 38:20.269
- They'd been pulled when he got here.
- Any visitors?

38:20.356 --> 38:24.065
There used to be a man. He drove
a motorcycle. He may have been a nephew.

38:24.156 --> 38:26.351
We know who you are.

38:26.436 --> 38:29.667
- We know what you did.
- All right, Bones. It's OK. Let's go.

38:29.756 --> 38:33.431
We'll check out his case files,
see what kids he could've recruited.

38:33.516 --> 38:36.076
Let's go.

38:38.756 --> 38:42.192
I'm gonna get a court order
to monitor Arthur Graves' visitors

38:42.276 --> 38:45.905
just in case Gorgonzola decides
to come back and visit his old master.

38:45.996 --> 38:48.351
You're saying "Gorgonzola"
on purpose.

38:48.436 --> 38:50.825
- Hey, Temperance.
- Hi.

38:50.916 --> 38:56.627
- If that's who I think it is, I can't be friendly.
- I understand. I'll just wait over here.

38:57.236 --> 39:00.512
Here. Uh, that's for you.

39:06.596 --> 39:10.669
Hayley's feeling better.
She even wanted to come.

39:10.756 --> 39:12.747
Please tell her thank you.

39:12.836 --> 39:15.714
- Agent Booth? The judge will see you now.
- Great.

39:15.796 --> 39:18.754
- In chambers.
- Why in chambers?

39:21.996 --> 39:25.591
Judge Watkins, Russ Brennan
has proven himself a flight risk.

39:25.676 --> 39:28.588
- He is attached to his family.
- Who he abandoned.

39:28.676 --> 39:33.227
- Temporarily.
- When his girl needed him, he returned.

39:33.316 --> 39:37.025
You're his parole officer.
We're all here because you violated him.

39:37.116 --> 39:41.314
Only because it's the law, Miss Julian.
I have a lot of faith in Russ Brennan.

39:41.396 --> 39:45.708
Judge Watkins, Russ Brennan not only
broke his parole by fleeing the region,

39:45.796 --> 39:48.390
he is a witness
in an upcoming murder trial.

39:48.476 --> 39:51.513
That has nothing to do with
this hearing.

39:51.596 --> 39:55.305
This is just an informal meeting
to decide if there'll be a hearing.

39:55.396 --> 39:58.752
- Can I say something?
- That is a slippery slope, Judge Watkins.

39:58.836 --> 39:59.951
- Can I?
-  No.

40:00.036 --> 40:04.507
- You said this was informal.
- I'm still the judge. I make the decisions.

40:04.596 --> 40:07.827
Agent Booth.
What are your thoughts?

40:07.916 --> 40:10.589
- I got nothing to say, Judge.
- Booth, please!

40:10.676 --> 40:14.430
I got a phone call
from the archbishop of DC 15 minutes ago.

40:14.516 --> 40:18.555
He promises to take a personal interest
in Mr Brennan's rehabilitation.

40:18.636 --> 40:23.551
- For God's sake, why?
- Also a psychiatrist, Dr Lance Sweets,

40:23.636 --> 40:27.868
who says he believes Mr Brennan
will not flee the jurisdiction again.

40:27.956 --> 40:32.905
Plus, a parole officer
recommending against revoking parole.

40:34.236 --> 40:38.946
- Why should I ignore all that?
- Ms Davis will simply send Russ home.

40:39.036 --> 40:41.869
- That is not my intention.
- It's not?

40:41.956 --> 40:45.153
- Mr Brennan should be punished.
- Punished how?

40:45.236 --> 40:47.272
- 30 days in county jail.
- What?

40:47.356 --> 40:49.745
- That's nothing.
- Seems pretty harsh to me.

40:49.836 --> 40:52.475
Also, 18 months
should be added to his parole.

40:52.556 --> 40:55.229
And he should wear
electronic monitoring.

40:55.316 --> 40:58.194
That is slightly more than nothing.
But only slightly.

40:58.276 --> 41:04.624
I will register your opinion, Miss Julian. But
that's my ruling. If I had a gavel, I'd bang it.

41:04.716 --> 41:09.107
How about the last one out
just slams the door?

41:12.996 --> 41:17.786
Consider what side you're on. Bishops,
psychiatrists, bleeding-heart parole officers.

41:17.876 --> 41:22.188
That's what's wrong
with the justice system in this country.

41:25.676 --> 41:28.065
Russ, you gotta
go with the marshals.

41:28.156 --> 41:30.465
- Thank you again.
- I didn't do anything.

41:30.556 --> 41:32.069
- You should thank him.
- Why?

41:32.156 --> 41:34.192
- He saved Russ.
- I didn't do anything.

41:34.276 --> 41:37.552
OK. Uh, Russ, time to go.

41:41.636 --> 41:47.552
OK, Russ. If you run again, disappoint that
woman and break your sister's heart, I will...

41:47.636 --> 41:50.070
Do something terrible.

41:50.156 --> 41:52.624
- I got it.
- Yeah, I hope you do.

41:52.716 --> 41:55.105
All yours, boys.

41:56.636 --> 41:59.230
Hey, Booth.

41:59.316 --> 42:02.194
- Thanks.
- Yeah. Clean nose, buddy.

42:02.276 --> 42:05.188
Clean nose, clean heart.

42:08.196 --> 42:13.873
"'Why was I forgotten? ' Mary said, stamping
her foot. 'Why does nobody come?"'

42:13.956 --> 42:17.869
"A young man whose name was Barney
looked at her very sadly."

42:17.956 --> 42:20.754
"Mary even thought she saw him...

42:20.836 --> 42:24.431
blink his eyes
as if to wink tears away."

43:00.516 --> 43:05.988
# <i>I lock the door</i>

What's that mean?
