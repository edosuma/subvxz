00:10.000 --> 00:22.000
You're Watching on 123Movies.to

03:07.448 --> 03:10.659
You know when a funeral
is really awful?

03:10.701 --> 03:12.661
When it's yours.

03:12.786 --> 03:15.663
That's me, Ray Adams-

03:15.788 --> 03:18.957
young, gifted and dead.

03:19.041 --> 03:20.959
These are my remains.

03:21.043 --> 03:23.795
And these three
mournful brothers,

03:23.920 --> 03:26.297
they're the men who killed me.

03:26.380 --> 03:30.425
Aw, they look so sad,
don't they?

03:30.509 --> 03:32.469
But this is how
they really feel.

03:39.349 --> 03:41.768
But they're not
the real reason I'm dead.

03:41.852 --> 03:45.229
These are their women.
Fine, ain't they?

03:45.354 --> 03:47.648
Some families
are blessed with great genes,

03:47.731 --> 03:50.484
and the Dandridge sisters
had it all.

03:50.609 --> 03:54.279
But they're not the reason
I'm dead either. She is.

03:54.362 --> 03:57.865
How did this sweet-faced woman
cause a man to die?

03:57.990 --> 04:01.076
Well, it began six months ago.
Go! Go! Go!

04:01.201 --> 04:04.787
- Now Howard comes up the middle,

04:04.871 --> 04:09.166
- breaks the tackle and gets the first down.

04:09.249 --> 04:13.795
Hey, baby, that's really nice of you,
sweetie, but we already have some food here.

04:13.962 --> 04:17.339
- What are you doing in here?
- Trying to watch the game that's right behind you.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.757
My book club is meeting
in here tonight.

04:19.841 --> 04:21.927
Baby, remember when we
talked last month?

04:22.010 --> 04:24.345
You said it was okay
if we watched the game.

04:24.470 --> 04:26.889
Oh, yeah. Eva changed all that.
She was supposed to tell you.

04:27.014 --> 04:30.434
- Well, she didn't.
- Hey, it's the men. What are you doing here?

04:30.559 --> 04:34.145
Are you joining our book club?
It's gonna be very enlightening.

04:34.229 --> 04:37.815
Sweetness, precious,
listen.

04:37.940 --> 04:42.027
Would it be okay, you know, if you
could take it in the other room?

04:42.152 --> 04:44.529
- Because we're all settled in.
- Yeah, the other room.

04:44.696 --> 04:48.282
- Well, I guess we could.
- You got a great girl!

04:48.407 --> 04:51.660
I love you, baby.
No! No, we cannot!

04:51.743 --> 04:53.661
Oh, yeah- Oh.

04:57.873 --> 05:00.751
Michael, Timothy, Darrell.

05:00.876 --> 05:04.170
Our book club
is reading Beloved,

05:04.254 --> 05:08.048
and we're gonna need the television
to watch the film when we're done.

05:08.132 --> 05:11.676
Oh, yeah, that's right,
honey. We need the room.

05:13.595 --> 05:17.515
You did not tell me you wanted
to use the room in my house, Eva.

05:17.681 --> 05:22.977
Well, I'm telling you
right now, Timothy.

05:23.061 --> 05:25.229
And it is half
my sister's house too.

05:25.354 --> 05:27.273
Community property.

05:27.398 --> 05:30.776
See, 'cause I want Kareenah to make
a good impression on the book club.

05:30.901 --> 05:32.652
Don't you?
No!

05:32.736 --> 05:35.947
- Excuse me?
- Yes.

05:37.073 --> 05:41.243
Look, we were
here first, Eva.

05:41.368 --> 05:44.329
Yes, but certainly the temporal
proximity of our advents...

05:44.454 --> 05:47.039
isn't determinative, is it?

05:50.959 --> 05:53.920
- I'll get back to you on that one.
- Yeah.

05:54.045 --> 05:57.214
Do you know what
she just said right there?

05:57.298 --> 06:01.968
- You don't get to me with your $50 words, Eva.
- That's right.

06:02.093 --> 06:06.597
What would you say if I
demanded you to leave this room?

06:06.722 --> 06:08.599
Yeah.
Yeah.

06:08.724 --> 06:12.310
I would say I find your particular
brand of crack very amusing.

06:12.435 --> 06:15.313
This isn't about a book...

06:15.438 --> 06:17.481
versus a football game, fellas.

06:17.606 --> 06:21.193
Oh, no. This is about men
versus women.

06:21.318 --> 06:23.278
Women who aspire to culture...

06:23.445 --> 06:25.905
and men who aspire
to scratch themselves.

06:26.030 --> 06:29.074
Women who bear the burdens in life
and men who create those burdens.

06:29.199 --> 06:33.578
Women who uplift humanity
and men who uplift lap dances.

06:33.661 --> 06:35.580
If society were left
to the whims of men,

06:35.663 --> 06:38.207
we'd still be in caves carving
pictures with our non-opposable thumbs.

06:38.290 --> 06:42.002
So, today, gentlemen,

06:42.127 --> 06:44.587
is the day
for civilized behavior.

06:44.712 --> 06:49.299
Today we women raise our voices against
tyranny, crudeness and play-off games.

06:49.425 --> 06:52.177
And that is it, gentlemen.

06:52.302 --> 06:56.305
End of story. The fat lady's
singing! Out of the room.

06:56.430 --> 07:00.225
By the way, if any of that was lost upon
you, then I've just proven my point again.

07:00.309 --> 07:03.436
Excuse me.

07:03.561 --> 07:06.188
Kareenah, baby,

07:06.314 --> 07:08.941
I am putting
my foot down.

07:12.569 --> 07:15.947
Damn! Damn!
I can't stand her.

07:16.030 --> 07:19.074
I can't stand her either, but
you really need to calm down.

07:19.158 --> 07:22.869
You're making me stressed. You need
to stand up to your wife, Timothy.

07:22.994 --> 07:25.705
It's like she tookyour balls
and turned them into earrings.

07:25.830 --> 07:27.748
Your wife is bling-blingin'
with your nuts.

07:27.832 --> 07:30.250
This is what we get for being
with Eva's little sisters.

07:30.375 --> 07:32.043
They could never stand up
to us without Eva.

07:32.168 --> 07:35.630
I really did think I was getting
one of the fabulous Dandridge girls.

07:35.713 --> 07:37.923
I didn't know it came with
the sister-in-law from hell.

07:38.007 --> 07:40.842
You gotta admit, they were the
finest women in the neighborhood.

07:40.967 --> 07:44.345
We used to say their daddy's johnson
- Should be bronzed. Right.

07:44.470 --> 07:46.347
Did you notice how they
stuck together in an argument?

07:46.472 --> 07:49.683
One for all and all for Eva.
That's how they're getting down.

07:49.808 --> 07:51.977
Come on, fellas. We need
to be more compassionate.

07:52.060 --> 07:54.437
Their parents died when they
were young and left them alone,

07:54.562 --> 07:56.814
so they have to stick together. Yeah.

07:56.897 --> 07:59.358
I should've used that argument to
get on Eva about that Dandridge fund.

07:59.483 --> 08:01.902
- You know what? I would've done it.
- Look at you cosigning.

08:02.027 --> 08:05.696
Mike, please, you need to
let that go. Every time. Okay.

08:05.863 --> 08:08.782
They've been putting money in that
account ever since they were teenagers.

08:08.866 --> 08:10.784
- What are they doing with it? Nothing.
- Step away from my man.

08:10.867 --> 08:12.744
I bet they don't even know
how much is in there.

08:12.869 --> 08:17.581
- There's no need for this.
- If he's your man, then what's he doing here with me?

08:17.706 --> 08:20.626
Charity work, heifer.
Look- Look- Hey, hey, hey!

08:20.751 --> 08:23.086
This is just
a big misunderstanding, okay?

08:23.211 --> 08:26.631
Fellas, I know that brother.
Yo, Ray!

08:26.756 --> 08:28.924
Hey!

08:29.049 --> 08:31.510
I didn't even know
he was back in town.

08:31.593 --> 08:33.720
You should be mad at me,
not each other.

08:33.845 --> 08:37.056
I've been dating both of you, and
- True, we don't have a commitment.

08:37.222 --> 08:39.975
But I couldn't decide
between you. Hey, fellas.

08:40.100 --> 08:43.186
I think he might be the man
to rid us of Eva.

08:43.352 --> 08:47.148
That dude? Aw, hell, no. You'd
be better off getting Ike Turner.

08:47.231 --> 08:50.108
They're about to cuss his ass out
and leave him high and dry. Watch.

08:50.234 --> 08:52.694
- Yeah, he's right.
- Let's go, all right?

08:52.777 --> 08:54.696
Oh, me too?
Uh-huh.

08:54.779 --> 08:57.406
- Get out of here!
- Be right back.

08:57.531 --> 08:59.533
- Did you see that? Did you see that?
- Wow!

08:59.658 --> 09:03.411
- Good to see you, man.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

09:03.495 --> 09:06.789
Fellas, he said he'll meet us
here the day after tomorrow.

09:06.914 --> 09:09.249
So he's a freak.
How does that help us with Eva?

09:09.374 --> 09:12.127
- Eva just needs a man.
- Come on, now.

09:12.252 --> 09:15.546
Remember, we tried that?
Remember Rashaun? Yeah.

09:15.630 --> 09:17.923
All I said was,
you was a little uptight.

09:18.007 --> 09:19.925
But I like that though.

09:20.008 --> 09:23.386
So it was like a compliment
in reverse.

09:23.470 --> 09:26.597
Oh, reverse. Right. I see. Yeah. Yeah.

09:26.722 --> 09:29.725
You feeling me.
Yeah, sure.

09:29.850 --> 09:33.603
Did you know that female spiders eat
the male when she's done with him?

09:33.686 --> 09:37.231
Yeah. They date, they laugh, and then
she turns his ass into a crab cake.

09:37.314 --> 09:40.692
Now, while the prospect of biting
your head off makes me happy,

09:40.817 --> 09:43.987
I am sure that ultimately
you are not a Happy Meal.

09:44.112 --> 09:46.155
So, I'm moving on
to better cuisine.

09:46.280 --> 09:48.199
Good-bye, Rashaun.

09:48.282 --> 09:50.951
Eva, wait. You're just
gonna say good-bye?

09:51.076 --> 09:55.913
Oh, no, it's not good-bye.
It's hello in reverse.

09:55.997 --> 10:00.167
Eva. Come on, girl.

10:00.292 --> 10:05.004
- Eva put that man in the mental ward.
- You're always exaggerating.

10:05.129 --> 10:08.716
Eva drove the brother insane.
I seen him last week.

10:08.841 --> 10:12.219
Dude sound like Ron Hopper.
Now he t-t-talk like th-th-this.

10:12.302 --> 10:14.679
This can work with Ray.
The boy is a specialist.

10:14.804 --> 10:16.681
He is a master player.

10:16.806 --> 10:19.766
Listen, Ray can get Eva
to let go ofher sisters.

10:19.892 --> 10:24.103
Then when it's just us and
them, we can have all their love.

10:24.187 --> 10:26.397
- Right, right.
- We can get him to seduce her.

10:26.480 --> 10:29.483
- Yes! - 'Cause all she really
needs is some you- know-what.

10:29.566 --> 10:32.277
Hold up. What Eva really
needs is a sensitive man-

10:32.360 --> 10:34.320
somebody that can help her
with her personality problems.

10:34.404 --> 10:38.449
What she needs is a dude that can hit that
ass till she starts speaking in tongues.

10:38.574 --> 10:41.451
- Amen.

10:41.535 --> 10:44.871
Right, right, right.
Can Ray do that?

10:44.996 --> 10:47.164
Okay, later,
after we finish doing it,

10:47.248 --> 10:50.709
we're gonna lie together and hold
each other and talk for a while, right?

10:50.876 --> 10:55.588
Okay. We can do it, but
I have to study. Come on.

10:55.671 --> 10:59.341
Eva says if I stick to a study schedule
- Don't say the "E" word.

10:59.466 --> 11:02.719
- Not in this house.
- I have to stick to my study schedule, okay?

11:02.844 --> 11:06.222
All of us agreed. What is
with you Dandridge women?

11:06.347 --> 11:09.808
I love my sisters, okay?
I'm sorry.

11:09.892 --> 11:12.394
I love you too.
It's just in a different way.

11:12.519 --> 11:16.939
Okay. Then I demand that you love
me the same way that you love them.

11:17.023 --> 11:20.150
You and them-
it's like apples and oranges.

11:20.234 --> 11:24.112
What? Lady, I am your husband,
okay? I pledged my life to you...

11:24.237 --> 11:27.323
before God and a bunch of ugly
- ass relatives I don't even like.

11:27.448 --> 11:31.368
I gave up all my wild ways for you,
and, baby, I had a hell of a lot of them.

11:31.535 --> 11:34.829
I never told you about the roses and the
butt-naked midgets or none of that shit.

11:34.912 --> 11:37.998
I had midget pros in different area codes. Uh
- huh.

11:38.123 --> 11:41.960
Therefore, I demands
to be a damn orange.

11:42.043 --> 11:45.421
You can stop playing now.
You know what? Fine.

11:45.546 --> 11:48.173
If a brother can't be an orange,
then you're cut off.

11:48.257 --> 11:51.760
I'm cut off? For real?
Yeah. That's right. Back up.

11:51.885 --> 11:53.761
I'm cut off? You gonna
cut me off? Don't touch me.

11:53.887 --> 11:56.514
Don't do that. Don't do it. Oh, damn.

11:56.597 --> 11:58.891
Don't do this. Don't.

11:59.016 --> 12:01.768
Oh, damn,
the flesh is weak. Oh.

12:01.893 --> 12:04.020
Mmm.

12:04.187 --> 12:07.064
Up.

12:07.189 --> 12:10.901
Down.

12:16.322 --> 12:20.826
Right there.

12:23.244 --> 12:25.746
- I have a dreadful problem. I need your help.

12:25.872 --> 12:28.332
- Gosh, you're doing it.
- How the hell did you get in here?

12:28.415 --> 12:31.043
Jacqui gave me a key
in case of an emergency.

12:31.168 --> 12:34.796
- Are you okay?
- Don't mind us. We're just having sex.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.173
So I should just come back in,
what, two minutes?

12:37.256 --> 12:40.175
- Is it really important?
- Get your ass out!

12:40.259 --> 12:45.388
- Just give us one minute.
- Oh,just one minute? Damn, it's worse than I thought.

12:46.889 --> 12:50.058
Man, what the
- She probably had a bad day or something.

12:50.142 --> 12:52.060
Look, hold on.
Where you going?

12:52.143 --> 12:55.938
Eva needs me. But we need you too! No-

12:56.022 --> 12:58.565
Wait a minute!
Damn you, Eva!

13:02.611 --> 13:06.447
- So,you two still talking about having a baby?
- Shh.

13:06.572 --> 13:08.449
Not so loud.

13:08.574 --> 13:11.743
IfTim even hears the word
"baby," he jumps on top of me.

13:11.827 --> 13:14.162
Oh, that's just
his male biological clock.

13:14.287 --> 13:17.123
It's when a man begins having
baby fever, like a woman.

13:17.248 --> 13:19.208
I read about it
in Psychology Today.

13:19.291 --> 13:22.419
All I know is that every time we
argue about it, he ends up drinking.

13:22.502 --> 13:25.588
The drinking
isn't serious, is it?

13:25.671 --> 13:27.590
No, but-

13:29.091 --> 13:33.470
Well, you know, his father
had a drinking problem. Mmm.

13:33.595 --> 13:36.013
Mmm. Ah! What do you think I should do?

13:36.138 --> 13:38.265
I don't like getting in
married people's business.

13:38.390 --> 13:42.227
There's nothing wrong with a grown
man having an occasional drink.

13:42.310 --> 13:44.395
Mmm.

13:44.520 --> 13:47.606
Although a study did show that a
drinking problem can be hereditary.

13:47.690 --> 13:50.942
You don't want your baby coming out of the
womb talking about, "Where the liquor at?"

13:51.026 --> 13:53.111
It wouldn't be right.

13:57.073 --> 14:00.367
Oh, hey, hey, hey. Baby,
I was still drinking that.

14:00.492 --> 14:03.578
Honey, I know, but you shouldn't
drink so much, you know?

14:03.661 --> 14:07.498
Eva and I werejust talking, and
- This is not what you need.

14:07.581 --> 14:10.584
Do you wanna do the breathing
exercises Bethany talked about?

14:10.709 --> 14:13.253
I don't wanna breathe. I just
want a drink. I want that drink.

14:13.378 --> 14:16.380
Baby, I don't like
to bring up the past,

14:16.505 --> 14:18.841
but you know that little problem
your daddy has.

14:18.966 --> 14:23.720
- I'm not my father.
- Oh, sweetie, I know. I know.

14:23.845 --> 14:26.681
It's just, tonight,
no more drinking for me.

14:26.764 --> 14:30.809
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Baby, can I just-

14:58.415 --> 15:01.293
Aw, come on, honey. Sing
it with me. Please? No.

15:01.376 --> 15:04.045
It's our theme song. Aw, party
- poop. No. No. No. No.

15:09.591 --> 15:11.593
Hey, I'm in here! Get out of
here!

15:11.676 --> 15:15.054
I hate that damn song!
Yeah! Smell that! Ew!

16:02.969 --> 16:04.887
This is Ray Adams,
y'all. What's happening?

16:05.013 --> 16:07.390
I thought you moved to Florida. I did.

16:07.473 --> 16:10.434
I worked at a car dealership down
there, but that was a year ago.

16:10.559 --> 16:12.435
I never keep a job
more than a year.

16:12.560 --> 16:15.730
- I work for Jomo's Meats in L.A. now.
- I know Jomo's.

16:15.813 --> 16:18.607
Why do you quit your job every
year? What's that about, brother?

16:18.732 --> 16:23.069
Well, I have to service
my many talents. Oh.

16:23.153 --> 16:25.780
I was brought up an orphan.
No mama, no daddy.

16:25.905 --> 16:27.823
No ties.
That's how I do it.

16:27.907 --> 16:30.909
If you guys hadn't noticed,
Ray is quite the player.

16:31.034 --> 16:34.287
- As we saw the other night.
- Yeah. Love your work, baby.

16:34.412 --> 16:36.998
You ought to be exempt
from taxes for that shit.

16:37.081 --> 16:40.375
Nothing Mike couldn't do. No,
I turned in my player card.

16:40.459 --> 16:44.295
I'm practically engaged to
a beautiful woman named Bethany.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.631
Congratulations.
Thank you, thank you.

16:46.756 --> 16:49.716
She's gorgeous too, but not
as fine as her sister, Eva.

16:49.800 --> 16:53.511
- Yeah, I can't even front.
- I wish I was good enough for Eva.

16:53.595 --> 16:56.180
- I wish I was her garbage, man. Look.
- Pow!

16:59.099 --> 17:03.103
She's cute. But why is
she scowling like that?

17:03.269 --> 17:06.063
Her face is so tight.
That's her sexy smirk.

17:06.146 --> 17:08.607
She ain't scowling.
Right. Right.

17:08.691 --> 17:11.609
W-W-What's c-c-cracking,
f-fellas?

17:11.734 --> 17:13.611
B-Bitch!

17:13.736 --> 17:16.446
Whoa!
Bitch!

17:16.571 --> 17:18.574
Hey! Hey!

17:18.656 --> 17:21.492
Back over here, man.
Don't pay the retard-

17:21.617 --> 17:23.494
The drinking
- He got out early. That's all.

17:23.619 --> 17:27.039
Ray, how would you like
to meet Eva?

17:27.123 --> 17:30.250
- Is she giving it up?
- "Is she giving it up?"

17:30.417 --> 17:34.837
- Man, she's double-jointed. - She's
lookin' up at her feet every night.

17:34.962 --> 17:38.674
- Bumping her head on the headboard, all that.
- That's right.

17:38.799 --> 17:42.093
So I only have one question:
What's wrong with her?

17:44.512 --> 17:46.514
Nothing.
Nothing. Nothing.

17:46.639 --> 17:48.849
So three grown men
walk into a bar...

17:48.974 --> 17:51.893
to hook up a man
for a perfectly good woman.

17:51.977 --> 17:55.396
What is it? She got five kids, a violent ex
- con boyfriend?

17:55.480 --> 17:59.441
Is she one of those evil, nasty sisters
who beats a brother down till he's dust?

17:59.525 --> 18:02.694
- What is it?
- It's the ex- con thing, bro.

18:02.819 --> 18:06.489
- Darrell!
- Ray, Ray, look, I gotta be honest with you.

18:06.656 --> 18:11.868
Eva is a piece of work, but we're prepared
to make it worth your while to take her out.

18:11.993 --> 18:14.329
You're gonna pay me
to go out with her?

18:14.454 --> 18:16.330
Are you worried that that
makes you look like a gigolo?

18:16.455 --> 18:20.250
- No. I mean, I kind of like that aspect.
- Okay!

18:20.334 --> 18:23.169
All right.
I'm in a financial bind.

18:23.294 --> 18:25.254
My landlord is selling my house.
I need cash to buy it.

18:25.338 --> 18:28.924
Man, that is perfect. Then we
all can benefit from this deal.

18:29.008 --> 18:31.510
Here's what we need you to do:
Take her out for a couple of months.

18:31.635 --> 18:33.636
Not just distract her,
but make her fall hard for you.

18:33.761 --> 18:36.180
I can definitely do that.
And I love a challenge.

18:36.305 --> 18:38.182
Really, she can't be
all that bad, can she?

18:38.349 --> 18:41.977
Eva's sisters gave her a cross
with Jesus on it for her birthday.

18:42.102 --> 18:45.771
- The next day,Jesus was gone.
- You're kidding, right?

18:45.855 --> 18:48.565
No. When you do it, you have to
make her fall in love with you,

18:48.691 --> 18:50.817
then you tell her you're leaving
town and get her to go with you.

18:50.942 --> 18:52.986
- Then you can dump her. It'll take her
years to relocate.- Yes!

18:53.069 --> 18:57.907
Time out. I'm sorry. This ain't
my kind of thing, you know.

18:58.032 --> 19:01.451
I'm a lover, not a con man. Mike,
let's hang out sometime, okay?

19:01.535 --> 19:03.453
But, Ray-
Get him a drink.

19:03.536 --> 19:05.538
Take another look at her.
That's not a zero.

19:05.621 --> 19:07.498
But think about it, Ray.

19:07.581 --> 19:10.417
You just had to bring up
theJesus thing.

19:10.542 --> 19:13.044
He got muscles. I didn't
think he'd be scared of her.

19:18.132 --> 19:22.802
Hey, I went out with that construction
guy yesterday. The cute one?

19:22.886 --> 19:25.888
Mm-hmm. And you know
we ended up in the bed.

19:25.972 --> 19:28.224
Did he have to take a number,
or was the line moving briskly?

19:28.307 --> 19:31.143
Ooh!

19:31.226 --> 19:33.603
No, no, tell it, please.
Ormandy, go.

19:33.728 --> 19:37.731
Thank you, Eva.
Honey, he dropped his pants,

19:37.857 --> 19:40.484
and he whipped it out
all proud.

19:40.567 --> 19:43.903
And I said, "Oh, no.
Where's the rest of it?"

19:46.030 --> 19:48.824
Ya have to put man in place
sometime, ya hear that?

19:48.907 --> 19:52.369
- Did she just call me a bitch?
- Right.

19:52.535 --> 19:54.621
What's up?

19:54.746 --> 19:57.957
- Hey!

19:58.082 --> 20:00.042
Hey, baby.

20:00.125 --> 20:03.920
Listen, Eva, I need to have a little
talk with you about the Dandridge fund.

20:04.045 --> 20:06.172
Why is that, Michael?
You're not in our family.

20:06.255 --> 20:08.757
- But I'm almost in.
- Almost isn't in, now, is it?

20:08.841 --> 20:12.802
Mike, honey, do you really want
to get into an argument...

20:12.927 --> 20:14.804
with a woman in here, hmm?

20:14.929 --> 20:19.016
Got some Frosted Mini-Wheats
in your scalp. Hey! You're fine.

20:19.141 --> 20:22.602
You're right, baby. You got
that thing for me? Oh, yeah.

20:27.857 --> 20:30.484
Fiber? "Fiber Power."

20:30.609 --> 20:33.862
Are you okay, Mike?
Is everything moving all right?

20:33.945 --> 20:36.739
He's a little irregular. All right.
You don't have to announce it.

20:36.822 --> 20:41.034
- Hey, I got somethin'for that.
- And if she can't fix you, I know I can.

20:41.118 --> 20:44.412
You need to quit, Telly, 'cause I
ain't even close to going your way.

20:44.495 --> 20:46.622
Damn.
Let me call headquarters.

20:46.747 --> 20:50.125
Hello. Yeah, it's me.
Listen, take Mike off the list.

20:50.209 --> 20:52.085
Mm-hmm.

20:52.210 --> 20:55.755
Sixty-nine out.
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

20:55.922 --> 21:00.300
I should've never came to this
place, better known as "Man Hell."

21:00.425 --> 21:02.886
No, this is
a female sanctuary.

21:02.969 --> 21:06.639
- Way the whole world ought to be.
Ain't that right, ladies? - Mm-hmm.

21:06.764 --> 21:08.641
See you.
Bye.

21:08.766 --> 21:10.851
Get some milk for them cornflakes. Hey.

21:10.976 --> 21:15.563
You should start making him take better care
ofhimself if you guys are gonna get married.

21:15.646 --> 21:19.942
He should get a colonic or see a
specialist. And I know a good one.

21:32.702 --> 21:35.163
Hey, got your order.
Where do you want it?

21:35.288 --> 21:38.082
Freezer number one.
Make sure you stack them neatly.

21:40.876 --> 21:42.794
Excuse me.

21:47.673 --> 21:49.800
Hello.
Where's Leonard?

21:49.925 --> 21:52.052
He's sick. I'm Oscar,
the assistant manager.

21:52.177 --> 21:56.055
Okay, Oscar, I'm Inspector
Dandridge from the health department.

21:56.180 --> 21:59.641
Yes, I've heard about you.
Good. Then you know the drill.

22:09.483 --> 22:11.860
Let's get clean.

22:27.081 --> 22:30.500
It does not look good,
Oscar.

22:30.626 --> 22:32.794
I found contamination
in red zones.

22:32.919 --> 22:34.921
Your glass freezer door
has a hairline break in it.

22:35.046 --> 22:37.756
And I found black pellets behind
the food containers in the back.

22:37.882 --> 22:41.593
That is probably just graphite
from the new units we put in.

22:41.718 --> 22:44.345
Your water's only 105 degrees.
Can you just let that slide?

22:44.429 --> 22:47.473
The requirement is 110,
because science tells us...

22:47.556 --> 22:50.767
at that temperature all
dangerous organisms will die.

22:50.892 --> 22:55.480
That means in your water, some will
live. And not just any germs, Oscar.

22:55.563 --> 22:59.817
No. The bad-ass ones, the ones that can
swim in 1 05- degree-temperature water...

22:59.900 --> 23:02.027
and live to party on
some child's french fries.

23:02.110 --> 23:04.320
We don't serve fries.
Are you mocking me?

23:04.445 --> 23:07.239
No, ma'am. That's good,
because I'm not done yet.

23:07.364 --> 23:10.409
This entire kitchen gets a level
four sanitation or you get written up.

23:10.576 --> 23:14.245
What? No, that means
it's in the newspaper.

23:14.370 --> 23:17.915
Thank goodness for you I've
got a soft heart. Heart?

23:18.040 --> 23:20.167
You don't have a heart.

23:20.250 --> 23:24.254
You got a hole with an ice pump in
it. You know, I don't understand you.

23:24.379 --> 23:27.006
Why do you have to be
so goddamn uncompromising?

23:29.258 --> 23:31.259
It's called principle,
Oscar.

23:31.385 --> 23:33.595
Maybe the world is in
short supply, but I am not.

23:33.678 --> 23:35.930
People pay their tax dollars
for my principle...

23:36.055 --> 23:38.307
so they can go into a restaurant
and not eat chicken fried rat...

23:38.432 --> 23:40.601
or bite into a bacon,
lettuce and ptomaine sandwich.

23:40.767 --> 23:43.061
If I slack up on you, then I
have to cut everyone a break,

23:43.144 --> 23:45.563
and pretty soon, the almonds
on your salad have legs.

23:45.646 --> 23:49.650
If that makes me uncompromising,
well, I wear it as a badge of honor,

23:49.775 --> 23:51.693
because I'm in
damn good company.

23:51.777 --> 23:55.613
Martin Luther King was uncompromising,
Nelson Mandela was uncompromising,

23:55.696 --> 23:57.865
and I'm sure your mother
was uncompromising,

23:57.948 --> 24:00.367
although the evidence of that
is not apparent today.

24:00.450 --> 24:04.120
So, why don't you think of me
as your mom right now?

24:04.245 --> 24:06.956
And Mama says,
"Clean it up!"

24:07.957 --> 24:10.334
See you in 48 hours.

24:13.753 --> 24:17.089
All right.
I'll go on the date with Eva.

24:17.173 --> 24:22.135
Mmm! Yes! Yes! What made
you change your mind, Ray?

24:22.260 --> 24:24.262
I saw her
at a restaurant.

24:24.345 --> 24:27.014
If I can get that woman, I'll go
down in the Player Hall of Fame.

24:27.139 --> 24:29.725
You sure will.
Okay, okay.

24:29.808 --> 24:32.185
So what's your price? I need
five grand to get the house.

24:32.310 --> 24:36.439
Five thousand dollars? I
don't know, man. Hey, hey, hey-

24:36.564 --> 24:39.691
Forty-five, what did you say
about five thousand dollars?

24:39.817 --> 24:42.152
Um, I said,

24:42.277 --> 24:45.738
"Five pounds
of collard greens, man.

24:45.822 --> 24:48.199
No ham."
Ordering soul food.

24:48.324 --> 24:51.368
Five thousand dollars?
Yes, man.

24:51.493 --> 24:53.536
I saw her in action.
You're getting off cheap.

24:53.661 --> 24:57.164
I don't know. I gotta talk
to the guys about this, Ray.

24:57.289 --> 24:59.958
All right. Well, let me know. I'm ready.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.210
Ooh.

25:02.335 --> 25:05.338
Thank you. Thank you.

25:05.338 --> 25:08.174
- I want to talk to you for a second, Eva.
- What about, sir?

25:08.257 --> 25:11.259
I was offered a position as
deputy health inspector in Chicago.

25:12.510 --> 25:14.887
- That's great.
- I'm not taking the job,

25:15.013 --> 25:17.139
but I think
you should consider it.

25:17.264 --> 25:19.183
Me, Theo?

25:19.308 --> 25:23.728
The representative from Chicago's been here
all week checking out my best inspectors.

25:23.853 --> 25:27.565
- He liked you. Send in Mr. Tillman.
- Yes, sir.

25:29.066 --> 25:32.402
- Oh, goodness.
- Hello, Eva.

25:32.527 --> 25:35.238
- You were checking me out the other day.
- Yes, I was.

25:35.363 --> 25:37.823
And you were amazing.

25:37.948 --> 25:39.950
You passed
with flying colors.

25:40.033 --> 25:43.995
I should have worn my diaper.
Chicago's a tough town.

25:44.078 --> 25:47.873
- We need our inspectors to have your intensity.
- Okay!

25:47.957 --> 25:50.709
- I'm at a loss for words.
- And that doesn't happen often.

25:50.834 --> 25:53.503
You don't have to
say anything now.

25:53.670 --> 25:55.546
I've still got a few more candidates
in other cities to look at.

25:55.671 --> 25:58.424
But I'll let you know in a few
weeks when I make my decision.

25:58.507 --> 26:02.052
Meeting you was...
an experience.

26:03.344 --> 26:06.764
Uh, Theo.
Right. Bye.

26:08.224 --> 26:10.559
That's great. I wanted your
job, but this is way better.

26:10.684 --> 26:13.645
- Oh, my God!
- This will be very exciting for you.

26:13.770 --> 26:15.772
Better job,
more money in a new city.

26:15.855 --> 26:17.857
Yeah, my sisters are-

26:19.024 --> 26:22.444
- What?
- Nothing.

26:22.527 --> 26:24.654
I'm sure they're gonna be
really happy for me.

26:24.821 --> 26:27.198
Thank you
for recommending me.

26:27.323 --> 26:30.450
Thanks.

26:30.576 --> 26:32.786
I will see you in two weeks. Thank you.

26:32.869 --> 26:34.787
Great.
Bye.

26:34.871 --> 26:37.164
How come I can never get
my toes done on girls'night?

26:37.289 --> 26:39.208
'Cause it's only
for the Dandridge sisters.

26:39.333 --> 26:43.086
- And nobody wants to
touch your funky-ass feet. -

26:44.545 --> 26:48.882
Oh! Ladies, ladies,
guess who I saw.

26:48.966 --> 26:51.259
Lucius Johnson.

26:51.385 --> 26:53.303
- Lucious Lucius.
- Hmm.

26:53.386 --> 26:55.930
I wouldn't mind
seeing him again.

26:56.055 --> 26:58.932
Me neither.
I wonder if he's married.

26:59.058 --> 27:01.852
Eva, are you okay?

27:01.935 --> 27:04.020
Yeah, sure.
Why wouldn't I be?

27:04.145 --> 27:06.981
- Are you still stuck on Lucius?
- No! G-God!

27:07.064 --> 27:09.566
Come on. Ancient history. Eva,

27:09.691 --> 27:13.820
once you give a man some of
your energy, he always has it.

27:13.903 --> 27:16.656
- Well, yeah.
- Especially if he popped that cherry.

27:16.739 --> 27:18.741
- Pop, pop, pop!
- No, no, no!

27:18.824 --> 27:22.744
- There was no pop, pop, popping of any cherries, Ormandy.

27:22.827 --> 27:26.122
Lucius was my first,
and I was his. That's all.

27:26.247 --> 27:28.499
Listen, the best way
to get over an old man-

27:28.582 --> 27:30.917
Is to get under a new one.

27:31.043 --> 27:34.295
Yeah! I am not thinking about Lucius.

27:34.420 --> 27:37.423
Okay?
It's girls'night, right?

27:37.590 --> 27:41.510
I'm sure that a group of intelligent...
women can come together...

27:41.635 --> 27:44.929
and talk about something
besides men.

27:47.056 --> 27:52.102
- Sad.

27:52.227 --> 27:55.396
Well, Tim did introduce me to
somebody new in his department.

27:55.480 --> 27:58.065
- Do you wanna meet him?
- I do need a date...

27:58.148 --> 28:01.193
to the mayor's formal
fund-raiser in a couple weeks.

28:01.276 --> 28:03.820
All right. I'll bite.
What are his vitals?

28:03.945 --> 28:07.615
Thirty-six, divorced, two kids.
I hear he's in group therapy.

28:07.782 --> 28:09.700
- Pass -
Mmm. - Uh-uh.

28:09.783 --> 28:12.118
Girl, messed-up men
are the best ones.

28:12.244 --> 28:17.123
- A messed-up man is redundant.
- I don't need to be set up, okay?

28:17.206 --> 28:19.249
I'm good.
I prayed on this.

28:19.333 --> 28:21.626
God- God is gonna
take care of it.

28:21.710 --> 28:23.628
God ain't shipping out
no men.

28:23.753 --> 28:26.964
Like hell he ain't.
Look here, when you talk to God,

28:27.089 --> 28:31.051
tell him a sister needs
a tall, fine one.

28:31.134 --> 28:35.721
- And not gay.
- You know you want the soul pole.

28:35.805 --> 28:38.932
No, he didn't. No, he didn't! Bam!

28:39.058 --> 28:42.936
A star for a star.

28:43.019 --> 28:46.480
You shouldn't let Eva stop us
from moving in together, Beth.

28:47.857 --> 28:50.400
See, I just don't sense
that we're spiritually...

28:50.484 --> 28:53.945
in tune with each other...
completely.

28:54.070 --> 28:57.698
And besides,
we're not married. Hmm?

28:57.823 --> 29:00.576
I'm not gonna propose
just to spend the night.

29:00.659 --> 29:03.244
Okay. Have I ever
pressured you about that?

29:05.496 --> 29:07.415
Of course not.

29:09.833 --> 29:14.003
And Eva says cohabitation does not increase
the chances of a lasting relationship.

29:14.128 --> 29:16.714
Oh, my God. Will you stop
it with the "Evaisms"?

29:16.839 --> 29:19.341
That woman with her statistics
and her philosophy- Mike, honey-

29:19.466 --> 29:23.303
She's very intelligent.
Don't hate on her for it.

29:23.386 --> 29:26.180
If she's so smart, why doesn't
she dissolve the fund...

29:26.305 --> 29:28.515
and let you live your own lives
with your own money?

29:28.641 --> 29:32.686
You know what? This is stress.
You wanna do some meditation, hmm?

29:32.811 --> 29:36.939
No. No meditation.

29:37.023 --> 29:39.650
Stress is why your colon
is all clogged up.

29:39.733 --> 29:42.027
Thanks to Eva's doctor,
my colon is a freeway.

29:45.196 --> 29:48.991
Look, all I wanna do
is spend the night with you...

29:49.074 --> 29:51.952
and not have to get up in the middle
of the night like some criminal.

29:53.411 --> 29:55.371
I enjoy spending time
with you.

29:56.789 --> 29:59.375
I love the way you blink.

29:59.500 --> 30:01.460
I love that smile.

30:04.045 --> 30:06.005
I love you.

30:12.052 --> 30:14.554
I love you too.

30:14.637 --> 30:17.932
But why should a man buy the software
when he can download for free?

30:20.267 --> 30:23.061
That is Eva talking. That is
not you talking. No, actually-

30:23.186 --> 30:25.354
Jacqui said it,
but it doesn't matter.

30:25.480 --> 30:29.733
You know, Eva took charge of the
family after our parents died.

30:31.985 --> 30:36.405
If we wanna have a child, it
should be our decision, not Eva's.

30:36.530 --> 30:41.076
All she said was that most marriages
fail within the first five years.

30:41.201 --> 30:44.537
Fifty-two percent. We've
only been married for three.

30:44.621 --> 30:46.872
If we had a baby
and something were to go wrong,

30:46.956 --> 30:49.792
then there's an innocent life
hanging in the balance of our failure.

30:49.917 --> 30:53.461
Nothing... is going...

30:53.586 --> 30:56.214
to go... wrong.

30:56.339 --> 30:58.382
Mmm. Hmm?

30:58.507 --> 31:02.093
Besides,you know I didn't have a
good relationship with my father.

31:02.219 --> 31:06.180
Honey, I know, but-
And all I want...

31:06.264 --> 31:09.725
is my chance...
to be a good daddy,

31:09.808 --> 31:13.520
to have
a little brown bundle...

31:13.603 --> 31:17.606
of love... and life.

31:18.774 --> 31:21.902
And I want it
because I love you.

31:23.903 --> 31:27.114
Now, tell me,
is that so wrong?

31:27.239 --> 31:29.825
Fifty-two percent.

31:29.950 --> 31:31.952
Honey,
Eva gives great advice.

31:32.035 --> 31:33.953
She put me through med school,
you know?

31:34.037 --> 31:36.664
God, do I know that!

31:36.789 --> 31:39.124
You know what?
You're not married to me.

31:39.208 --> 31:42.460
You're married to Eva. I'm
just a handyman with a penis.

31:42.544 --> 31:45.797
Tim, like you ever fix
anything around here!

31:49.133 --> 31:51.134
What- What did I say?

32:29.541 --> 32:32.502
I cannot believe we are paying
five grand to this man.

32:32.627 --> 32:35.088
Just think of it as an investment.

32:35.213 --> 32:38.757
Once Eva's gone, we'll all be happy.

32:41.551 --> 32:45.388
It was a great idea-you having
him meet Eva at church.

32:45.513 --> 32:48.349
- She is going to love that.
- Well-

32:48.474 --> 32:51.101
Fellas, I don't think we should
be talking about this here.

32:51.184 --> 32:56.147
God might hear us. God
made Eva, so we're even.

32:56.272 --> 32:58.315
Speaking of which, where is this guy?

32:58.440 --> 33:00.651
Church is almost over.

33:00.734 --> 33:04.112
Tim, this is a black church.
It's never over.

33:22.627 --> 33:24.754
Excuse me.

33:26.714 --> 33:28.841
Yo, what took you
so long?

33:28.966 --> 33:31.218
I'm not the churchgoing type.
You people get up early.

33:31.343 --> 33:35.013
Nice job with the choir,
Eva, girl. They were bangin'.

33:35.138 --> 33:39.600
You know, Reverend, your sermon
today was great. I mean, bang-up job.

33:39.725 --> 33:42.310
Although you did miss a word of
that verse from the Book of Acts.

33:42.435 --> 33:45.063
I think I was the only one who
caught it, and, well, God, of course.

33:45.229 --> 33:48.148
So I took the liberty of
jotting down a few suggestions...

33:48.232 --> 33:51.693
on how you can do better
in the future. Say what?

33:51.818 --> 33:54.612
My child, please.
I appreciate that.

33:54.737 --> 33:56.989
But you know what?
I got this.

33:57.073 --> 33:59.908
- Praise the Lord.

34:00.033 --> 34:02.786
Praise him. Eva, we're
all waiting for you.

34:02.911 --> 34:06.581
Can't you see I'm busy, Michael?
I am speaking with the reverend.

34:06.706 --> 34:08.581
Oh, no, no, honey.
Please, go.

34:08.706 --> 34:11.918
Go back to your friends.
Please- No. Go.

34:12.085 --> 34:14.963
Actually, Reverend, I needed to
talk to you and get your advice...

34:15.088 --> 34:18.799
for a friend of mine who has a
dilemma about a job she's considering.

34:18.924 --> 34:22.219
Mmm. I've got people who have
much bigger problems, Eva.

34:22.302 --> 34:27.806
People whose souls need to be saved
from eternal damnation. Stuff like that.

34:27.931 --> 34:30.891
A soul lasts forever,
Reverend, and this job may not.

34:30.976 --> 34:34.187
Please, I need to tell her
what to do. Tell your friend I-

34:35.438 --> 34:37.313
Follow her heart.

34:37.440 --> 34:42.277
Now, please, excuse me.

34:42.402 --> 34:44.821
Amen.

34:46.530 --> 34:49.408
Eva, this is Ray Adams,
a friend of mine.

34:49.491 --> 34:52.577
Hello.
Hello, Raymond.

34:52.702 --> 34:55.705
Call me Ray. No one calls me
Raymond. Well, I do, Raymond.

34:55.788 --> 34:59.124
What's so funny?

34:59.208 --> 35:02.502
I love a woman
who speaks her mind.

35:02.627 --> 35:04.837
My girlfriend's the same way.

35:04.963 --> 35:07.339
Oh. Well, good for her.

35:07.465 --> 35:10.676
Ray, I didn't know
you were seeing anyone.

35:10.801 --> 35:13.762
Oh, yeah,
about six months now.

35:13.887 --> 35:17.431
I see a friend of mine over there.
It's nice to meet you. All of you.

35:23.353 --> 35:25.271
What the hell
was that, man?

35:25.355 --> 35:28.649
Why did you tell her you had a
woman? We gave you half the money.

35:28.732 --> 35:32.569
If you're thinking about screwing us
- Mmm! Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

35:32.652 --> 35:36.322
No woman wants a man who another
woman doesn't already want.

35:36.447 --> 35:39.324
The next time I meet her,
I'll make my move.

35:39.408 --> 35:42.035
I'm sure me and my girlfriend
will be having trouble by then.

35:46.247 --> 35:48.666
You're good. I should've known. Yeah.

35:48.791 --> 35:52.085
Look, Tim is having some people
over next week for a barbecue.

35:52.210 --> 35:54.796
Why don't you come by?
I will.

35:54.963 --> 35:57.965
Just let the master
handle his business.

35:58.090 --> 36:00.342
By the way, I'm gonna need
a little expense money.

36:00.467 --> 36:04.262
Expenses for what? I need
funding to take Eva on a date.

36:04.345 --> 36:07.598
What about the five
grand? That was my fee.

36:07.681 --> 36:10.000
"Fee." "Expenses."
See how the words are different?

36:10.000 --> 36:11.351
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to
"Fee." "Expenses."
See how the words are different?

36:11.351 --> 36:11.476
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:11.476 --> 36:14.729

do it. Three hundred?

Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:22.000 --> 36:23.862
All right. Fine. Fine.

36:23.987 --> 36:26.113
But you're on it.
Like wet paint.

36:26.239 --> 36:28.365
Okay.

36:36.038 --> 36:40.667
- Ray was pretty fine. - Yeah, and he
has a girlfriend. - Leave him alone.

36:40.751 --> 36:43.586
- All the good prospects are all taken.
- Or gay.

36:43.711 --> 36:46.339
You should always use an opportunity
like this to swoop on a man.

36:46.422 --> 36:50.509
When Mr. Mason left his wife
last year, I jumped right on it.

36:50.592 --> 36:55.638
- Ormandy, Mr. Mason is 70.
- Are you crazy? See, an old man is a perfect man.

36:55.721 --> 36:59.016
You give him a little Viagra
so he can handle his business,

36:59.141 --> 37:03.436
and right before he gets on your nerves,
honey, he dies and leaves you his cash.

37:03.561 --> 37:06.689
That's like having a dick with
a lottery number on it! Yeah!

37:06.772 --> 37:10.234
- Mm-mmm, that's nasty. -
Eva isn't a home wrecker.

37:10.359 --> 37:13.736
So don't worry about them.
You can do much better.

37:13.820 --> 37:17.573
- Jacqui, you are always blocking on Eva.
- I do not.

37:17.698 --> 37:19.950
You do too. You're spoiled.

37:20.033 --> 37:23.286
- You always wanna keep Eva to yourself.
- No, that's ridiculous.

37:23.370 --> 37:25.872
- Isn't that, Eva?
- Of course it is, honey.

37:25.955 --> 37:27.873
Jacqui, you are a big-ass baby.

37:27.998 --> 37:32.127
- The queen ofbig-ass babies. - So why
are you guys always ganging up on me?

37:32.252 --> 37:35.671
- Because you're an evil, twisted little heifer.
- Twisted!

37:35.755 --> 37:39.049
- Ladies, is this how we behave?
- It has been this way since we were little!

37:39.133 --> 37:42.260
When you cut off my baby doll's
head when I was 10!

37:42.385 --> 37:45.013
You broke my Boo-Boo Kitty,
so the bitch had to die!

37:47.723 --> 37:51.560
- I'm moving to Chicago.

37:51.685 --> 37:56.355
- Eva, what did you just say?
- I'm moving to Chicago.

37:56.439 --> 38:00.525
I might be getting a betterjob
and moving...

38:00.651 --> 38:03.403
to Chicago.

38:05.071 --> 38:07.698
My boss told me
the other day.

38:07.865 --> 38:11.284
Come on. I mean, it's deputy
health inspector of Chicago!

38:11.410 --> 38:13.912
It's a great opportunity.

38:13.995 --> 38:16.998
Look, I've been looking
for a way to tell you guys.

38:18.082 --> 38:21.168
So there it is...
in a nutshell.

38:21.251 --> 38:24.170
Th-That-
That's great for you.

38:24.254 --> 38:27.089
Yeah, it- it is.

38:28.716 --> 38:32.010
Girl, there's some fine brothers
up in Chicago.

38:32.093 --> 38:34.637
So you're just gonna up
and leave, just like that?

38:34.762 --> 38:37.598
No, I have to get
the job first.

38:37.765 --> 38:42.435
I'll find out in a few
weeks. Oh, I'm sorry.

38:42.602 --> 38:46.397
First you get the job, then you pack
up and leave like a thief in the night?

38:46.480 --> 38:50.192
You're just gonna leave us
like that? Do not attack Eva.

38:50.275 --> 38:52.319
She has sacrificed for us. I'm not!

38:52.444 --> 38:54.529
Okay, okay, stop!

38:54.612 --> 38:57.239
Please, stop it! Stop it!

38:58.449 --> 39:01.076
If you don't want me to go,
Jacqui, I won't.

39:01.159 --> 39:04.454
- It's not my decision.
- It is if you're gonna hate me for it.

39:06.247 --> 39:10.334
I don't wanna lose your
friendship, any of you.

39:10.459 --> 39:13.878
Jacqui doesn't mean it,
do you?

39:15.963 --> 39:17.923
I do want you
to be happy, Eva.

39:20.217 --> 39:24.637
So if going...
makes you happy,

39:26.722 --> 39:29.266
I'm happy.

39:32.143 --> 39:35.104
You sure?

39:35.229 --> 39:37.857
- You promise?

39:37.982 --> 39:39.942
Yeah.

39:42.152 --> 39:44.112
Oh!

39:44.237 --> 39:46.989
I love you, sister.
I love you too, sister.

39:47.156 --> 39:49.283
Mm-hmm. We so pretty,
perfect and shit.

40:02.002 --> 40:04.128
Hey, make sure you
cook that meat thoroughly.

40:04.254 --> 40:07.089
I'd hate to tell you what kind
of things live in raw meat.

40:07.173 --> 40:10.008
Please don't.
Thank you very much.

40:12.093 --> 40:14.512
Babe. Is he eating those beans again?

40:14.637 --> 40:18.724
What's wrong? I see Darrell
found my spicy baked beans.

40:18.849 --> 40:22.769
- Give him the Heimlich.
- Separates the men from the boys.

40:22.852 --> 40:26.856
- He knows better.
- No. See, give him some bread, you guys. Bread.

40:27.023 --> 40:29.858
Baby, here, eat this. Eat
this. Here, here, here.

40:29.983 --> 40:33.069
If you wanna help, stop making
these damn beans every function, Eva!

40:33.194 --> 40:36.614
- What did you put in that stuff?
- Special recipe.

40:36.697 --> 40:38.866
- It's only for a real man.
- I just wanna hear him talk.

40:38.991 --> 40:41.493
Give him some more beans. Can he talk?

40:41.618 --> 40:44.704
Oh, hey. I didn't know
Mike's friend was coming.

40:44.829 --> 40:46.872
Oh, baby, listen. Why
don't you take care of this?

40:46.998 --> 40:49.375
I'm gonna go over and say hello. Okay.

40:49.458 --> 40:52.544
Excuse me, Eva.
Thankyou.

40:52.711 --> 40:54.963
Ray, what's up? Yo!

40:55.088 --> 40:57.882
He's really fine, Eva.

40:57.965 --> 41:01.093
I'm not impressed
by that... much.

41:01.218 --> 41:03.178
You say hi to Ray, man?

41:03.303 --> 41:06.973
Give him a chance.
You gotta bend a little, girl.

41:08.015 --> 41:09.933
Are you saying
I'm not accessible?

41:10.058 --> 41:13.395
Yes, that is what
I'm saying, Eva.

41:13.478 --> 41:16.897
You know, you're too good
of a person to be alone.

41:17.023 --> 41:20.025
What's going on?
Everything's cool? Yeah.

41:20.150 --> 41:23.778
I'm your sister, I love you,
and I'm asking you to bend.

41:23.903 --> 41:25.780
Okay, but it's the fine ones
who leave you broke,

41:25.905 --> 41:27.907
with bad credit
and a hair weave you don't need.

41:27.990 --> 41:30.033
Mm-mm-mm!

41:30.200 --> 41:33.411
Hello again, Eva.
Hi, Raymond.

41:33.495 --> 41:36.664
Look here, I hope you don't
mind, but I invited Ray.

41:36.747 --> 41:38.749
No, he's most welcome.

41:41.084 --> 41:45.380
Look, I have to
go tell Darrell something.

41:45.463 --> 41:47.631
I'll be right back.

41:47.757 --> 41:50.175
Yeah, you know what? These
- We don't need to cook these.

41:50.259 --> 41:52.677
Excuse us.

41:52.761 --> 41:54.762
Good to see you.

41:56.389 --> 41:58.265
So, Raymond, what is it
that you do again?

41:58.432 --> 42:02.435
I deliver meat...
forJomo's.

42:02.602 --> 42:05.646
Meat delivery.
Interesting.

42:05.772 --> 42:10.108
Jomo's deals in only premium
meats, high-end clientele.

42:10.192 --> 42:12.611
What about you?
I'm a health inspector.

42:12.694 --> 42:16.113
- That sounds interesting too.
- I need a gurney for my ass.

42:16.197 --> 42:18.365
See the man with flames
coming out of his ass?

42:18.449 --> 42:20.867
We're gonna need backup.
Thank you. Squeeze and pull.

42:20.951 --> 42:24.662
- How about we go get a plate of food?
- Sure. A nice hot one.

42:28.082 --> 42:30.459
Two minutes and she
has not insulted him.

42:30.584 --> 42:35.046
This could be very promising.
Mm-hmm. They feel good together to me.

42:36.589 --> 42:40.008
So, you wanna go out
with me sometime?

42:40.133 --> 42:42.969
Is your girlfriend coming too?
'Cause we could all play canasta...

42:43.094 --> 42:45.179
or Parcheesi
or Taboo or something.

42:45.304 --> 42:48.265
Well, she's, uh-

42:48.390 --> 42:52.435
Actually, it's not working out.
We're not together anymore.

42:52.561 --> 42:54.479
Oh.

42:54.562 --> 42:57.106
As one car breaks down,
you just hop into another one?

42:57.231 --> 42:59.858
I'd like to think that going
out with you is riding in a limo.

43:01.693 --> 43:05.571
- I'm sorry. Did I insult you?
- No. No, it was very funny.

43:05.696 --> 43:07.656
I just don't laugh a lot.

43:07.740 --> 43:11.410
Lord, help me.
That's a good-looking man.

43:11.535 --> 43:13.995
I can't keep
my legs together.

43:14.120 --> 43:16.998
The sun comes up and you
can't keep your legs together.

43:17.123 --> 43:20.584
Telly.
He's got sneaky eyes.

43:20.667 --> 43:23.586
Jacqui,
don't you start.

43:23.670 --> 43:26.631
I didn't make the man's eyes
all beady and shifty. Shh!

43:26.714 --> 43:29.133
- What?
- You never answered my question.

43:29.216 --> 43:32.177
What question was that?
Will you go out with me?

43:33.970 --> 43:37.473
Look, Raymond, I know we just met,
and you seem like a really nice guy,

43:37.556 --> 43:41.560
but I think I should tell you a
little something about myself. Okay.

43:41.685 --> 43:43.728
I know the one thing
that scares men to death.

43:43.853 --> 43:46.189
- What's that?
- I know the truth about them.

43:46.272 --> 43:49.191
And the truth is, most men
don't really know what they want.

43:49.274 --> 43:51.318
I've been through
all the basic types.

43:51.401 --> 43:54.696
The playa-playas, who
think women are disposable toys.

43:54.821 --> 43:58.741
The confused man, who doesn't know if
he wants to date you or your brother.

43:58.866 --> 44:01.284
The lazy ones, who live with their mother
and expect you to pick up the check.

44:01.368 --> 44:04.746
So if you really
wanna go out with me,

44:04.871 --> 44:07.373
realize that it means
being a gentleman,

44:07.498 --> 44:11.209
understand that it means
respecting my mind, body and spirit.

44:11.334 --> 44:13.711
Eva, I'm not afraid
of you.

44:13.878 --> 44:16.839
And I wanna go on record as
saying I totally respect...

44:16.922 --> 44:20.384
your mind and your spirit.

44:20.509 --> 44:22.802
- What about my body?
- It's beautiful.

44:22.886 --> 44:27.348
- But will you respect it?
- I'll do anything to it you want me to.

44:27.431 --> 44:30.225
Look at that. The corners of
your mouth actually turn up.

44:30.350 --> 44:32.561
A smart-ass.
I like that.

44:32.686 --> 44:34.687
So, will you
go out with me?

44:36.230 --> 44:38.107
He's eating the beans.
He's eating the beans.

44:38.232 --> 44:40.901
Oh, no, brother.
Don't do it, brother.

44:42.235 --> 44:44.112
Ahhh!

44:44.237 --> 44:49.074
Whoo! That's good.
That's really good.

44:49.199 --> 44:51.660
- Kareenah sure can cook, huh?
- Actually, I made those beans.

44:51.743 --> 44:53.828
Really?

44:53.953 --> 44:57.748
You put your foot in them, girl.
Damn, I love spicy food.

44:57.873 --> 45:01.710
- How about we go out this weekend?
- Sounds good.

45:01.793 --> 45:03.711
Fabulous.

45:10.384 --> 45:12.302
You're late.
I know.

45:12.427 --> 45:15.680
I left early, but there was a
real bad accident on the street.

45:15.763 --> 45:18.599
Really?

45:18.766 --> 45:23.061
- Who told you I like lilies?
- Sometimes a man gets lucky.

45:32.611 --> 45:35.279
Looks like somebody likes-

45:35.405 --> 45:38.073
I was noticing all the pictures
of the horses.

45:39.283 --> 45:41.451
You look good.

45:41.576 --> 45:44.621
I love horses.
And thank you.

45:44.746 --> 45:48.123
Here, uh,
let me take these from you.

45:51.209 --> 45:53.503
You ever see the accident rates
on these things?

45:53.628 --> 45:56.005
They're very dangerous.
No.

45:56.130 --> 45:59.883
That's why I drive this.
Okay.

45:59.967 --> 46:02.802
You're joking, right?

46:02.927 --> 46:05.638
Nope.

46:15.813 --> 46:17.982
This is what you drive
when you take out a woman?

46:18.107 --> 46:20.484
Yeah. It's clean
and it's free.

46:22.235 --> 46:25.113
I'm saving to buy a house. Oh.

46:25.238 --> 46:28.490
I can understand that. Home
ownership is very important.

46:28.657 --> 46:30.534
Does your mother live with you? No.

46:30.659 --> 46:32.744
Even better.

46:35.079 --> 46:37.790
My boss has been hinting
he might want to slow down.

46:37.915 --> 46:39.833
Let somebody run
the day-to-day for him.

46:39.917 --> 46:43.795
I think he might want me to do it.
That's great. When do you start?

46:43.878 --> 46:47.506
I'm thinking about it. There is
nothing wrong with a little ambition.

46:47.631 --> 46:50.676
I was a secretary in my department.
Now I'm the lead inspector.

46:50.801 --> 46:54.429
I gave myself five years to
get there. I did it in four.

46:56.681 --> 46:59.016
There you go, doing that thing
you do with your face again.

46:59.141 --> 47:00.976
Just drive
your meat wagon, man.

47:01.059 --> 47:03.144
Did you hear about the
black caveman they found?

47:03.311 --> 47:05.688
They knew he was black by the curve
of his jaw, length of his spine,

47:05.813 --> 47:08.607
Cadillac he was buried in.

47:08.691 --> 47:13.903
You tell me a joke now. I'm not
a jokey-joke type person, so-

47:15.029 --> 47:17.365
Okay.
How about a little music?

47:18.824 --> 47:22.285
Ahh!

47:22.369 --> 47:24.537
All right, all right.

47:24.662 --> 47:26.998
Yeah.

47:28.541 --> 47:30.667
I love this record.

48:15.371 --> 48:18.332
This must be a pretty good restaurant,
you being a health inspector and all.

48:18.415 --> 48:20.751
Oh, yeah. Most places
I can't even go to.

48:20.876 --> 48:24.587
They try to poison me. But this place
- Oh, God, it's different.

48:24.712 --> 48:27.631
The manager has O.C.D.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder.

48:27.757 --> 48:29.967
He cleans all day long.
You could eat off the floors.

48:30.092 --> 48:34.387
Sounds appetizing.
Oh, you think that's funny?

48:34.429 --> 48:36.806
Did you know that if food
isn't prepared just right...

48:36.889 --> 48:39.475
your throat can close up and
you can drown in your own vomit?

48:39.600 --> 48:42.018
Oh, I'm hungry now.

48:43.770 --> 48:48.107
Mmm!Just like
Mama used to make.

48:55.446 --> 48:59.783
Okay. That's really funny, Raymond,
but I know when somebody's choking.

49:04.370 --> 49:06.956
You can stop now.

49:10.334 --> 49:12.335
Oh, my God. Call 911!

49:17.256 --> 49:20.425
That's not the hug I was hoping
for, but it'll do for now.

49:23.136 --> 49:25.054
I'm just playing.

49:25.138 --> 49:27.056
Is everything all right?
Yes.

49:27.139 --> 49:29.391
Yes. My friend here
was just telling a littlejoke.

49:32.727 --> 49:36.272
- What are you doing here?
- Well, well, Inspector Dandridge.

49:36.397 --> 49:40.067
Now, you-you manage the Red
Leaf restaurant across town.

49:40.150 --> 49:43.445
Oh, no, not after
your last inspection.

49:43.570 --> 49:48.240
I was fired for a broken light
bulb in a freezer. Remember?

49:48.365 --> 49:50.409
No. No, no, no,
I don't want you.

49:50.534 --> 49:52.494
I want the man with O.C.D.

49:52.619 --> 49:54.495
Eva, relax.
It's all right.

49:54.621 --> 49:57.873
The old manager's not here.
How's that salad working?

49:57.957 --> 50:01.418
You know, we used our special
house dressing just for you.

50:01.543 --> 50:05.755
- Creamy, isn't it?
- I'm not eating here. Let's go.

50:05.838 --> 50:09.341
I'm sure it's okay.
Did you hear what I just said?

50:09.466 --> 50:14.429
I am not eating here.
Let's go! Okay. Okay.

50:17.515 --> 50:19.516
Don't forget to validate.

50:22.811 --> 50:24.729
Don't be mad at me.
I just wanted to stay.

50:24.812 --> 50:27.064
And have her
put things in my food?

50:27.148 --> 50:30.275
I don't think so, pal. I just
think you overreacted a little bit.

50:30.400 --> 50:32.319
You're a civil servant,
not the F.B.I.

50:32.402 --> 50:35.822
Well, excuse the hell
out of me.

50:35.905 --> 50:38.741
Why don't you tell me about the
demanding world of meat delivery?

50:38.824 --> 50:41.993
So, you just basically pick it up
and deliver it to a guy named Bob?

50:42.118 --> 50:45.288
Or is there some sort of math
involved? You don't need to be so nasty.

50:45.413 --> 50:47.998
Oh, there is definitely a need
for me to get nasty.

50:48.123 --> 50:51.001
My job is serious.
It is not a hobby.

50:51.126 --> 50:54.712
Guess what, meat boy? I'm sure
my job pays more than yours does.

50:54.837 --> 50:56.839
So in my eyes, the eyes
of society and the I.R.S.,

50:56.964 --> 50:58.841
that makes me bigger
and better than you.

50:58.966 --> 51:00.842
So why don't you think about
that the next time you're out...

51:00.968 --> 51:04.470
doing the complex work
of toting around a pig's ass.

51:06.556 --> 51:08.641
'Cause that's like
a family thing.

51:08.766 --> 51:10.684
You know, with the thing
- Excuse me.

51:10.767 --> 51:13.478
Hello. Kareenah, it's
Eva. I need to talk.

51:13.603 --> 51:17.732
Hey.

51:17.857 --> 51:20.400
It's Eva. And Kareenah.
We got an emergency.

51:20.776 --> 51:22.694
Jacqui, it's Eva.

51:22.777 --> 51:24.904
And Kareenah. And
Bethany. Code seven, girl.

51:25.029 --> 51:26.781
No!

51:26.906 --> 51:29.408
- What's up?
- The date was catastrophic.

51:29.533 --> 51:32.327
Wait till I tell you what happened.
This fool had the nerve to-

51:32.410 --> 51:35.788
- What the hell went wrong?
- Kareenah was falling in love with having a baby.

51:35.913 --> 51:38.457
And me and my wife
were cuddling. I mean,

51:38.582 --> 51:40.667
I was hitting it real manly,
and I didn't get to finish.

51:40.751 --> 51:43.920
They had a four-way phone
conference about your date all night.

51:44.045 --> 51:46.672
I thought you was the master
player. The master player.

51:46.756 --> 51:50.801
I can't get to her. Most women have
a few barriers around their hearts.

51:50.926 --> 51:55.763
Eva has an electrified fence
with rabid pit bulls. Okay?

51:55.847 --> 51:58.390
And that mouth!
My ears are still bleeding.

51:58.474 --> 52:01.893
We got to do something about this, 'cause
we can't have Eva messing up our plan.

52:02.018 --> 52:06.230
Ray, listen, all you have to do is find a
way to get back on her good side. That's all.

52:06.314 --> 52:08.941
- He's gotta sleep with her. That's what you gotta do.
- Yeah, that's it.

52:09.066 --> 52:12.194
Look, I would love to have
another shot with her, all right?

52:12.277 --> 52:15.113
My pride was hurt. But I'm
sure it's out of the question.

52:15.238 --> 52:17.990
What, you don't like women?
Watch yourself now.

52:18.115 --> 52:21.118
- You have to have sex with her.
- I don't think that's the answer.

52:21.243 --> 52:24.120
Oh, man, he don't like women!
I told you this dude was-

52:24.204 --> 52:28.207
Hey, hey! I do like women,
all right? How are you?

52:28.290 --> 52:32.127
Look, fellas, I'm sorry,

52:32.294 --> 52:34.212
but there's no way she's
gonna go out with me again.

52:34.295 --> 52:38.424
Hmph. No way. I'll
give you your money back.

52:38.591 --> 52:40.801
You're damn right
you will.

53:14.912 --> 53:17.164
'Cause I'm in
damn good company.

53:17.289 --> 53:20.042
Martin Luther King
was uncompromising.

53:20.167 --> 53:22.627
Nelson Mandela:
uncompromising.

53:22.752 --> 53:25.797
Confucius: uncompromising.

53:25.922 --> 53:29.716
And so am I. Here is your citation. Eva.

53:29.842 --> 53:32.928
What, Raymond? I am working.
So am I.

53:33.011 --> 53:35.346
And you're right.
There's no math involved.

53:35.471 --> 53:37.431
Why did I stop her
from leaving?

53:37.515 --> 53:40.142
It wasn'tjust curiosity
that made me go after her.

53:40.309 --> 53:43.728
Now that I'm dead, I know it was
something special about Eva.

53:43.853 --> 53:47.148
I know you're upset with me, but
I want you to go out with me again.

53:47.231 --> 53:49.691
And why is that?
'Cause you're pretty.

53:51.026 --> 53:53.028
That's the most shallow thing
I've ever heard.

53:53.111 --> 53:56.656
It's not like I got to really know you.
So basically, I'm working on beauty here.

53:56.739 --> 54:01.034
Well, you know what? I am so much
more than what's on the outside, okay?

54:01.159 --> 54:03.828
More than what appeals
to some... meat man.

54:03.912 --> 54:06.622
And thank you
for the compliment.

54:06.706 --> 54:10.334
I feel like I owe you.
We can do anything you want.

54:10.459 --> 54:13.628
Anything?
Anything. Sky's the limit.

54:24.637 --> 54:28.807
Wait. Okay. Okay.
Whoa. Whoa.

54:49.533 --> 54:53.370
Whoa! Oh, God. Oh, God.
Hang on! Hang on!

54:56.914 --> 55:00.083
My ass feels like it got
caught in a blender.

55:00.209 --> 55:02.669
You did good. You only
fell what, four times?

55:02.752 --> 55:04.504
Yeah.

55:04.587 --> 55:07.840
I have a confession to make.
I used you.

55:07.923 --> 55:10.050
I can't afford to
come here all the time.

55:10.175 --> 55:12.219
I come but once a month
when I save my pennies.

55:12.302 --> 55:15.388
When you asked to go out again,
I didn't really want to, but...

55:15.513 --> 55:18.015
I thought, you know-

55:18.098 --> 55:20.684
I guess that makes me
a bad person, right?

55:20.809 --> 55:24.812
No. I just wanted to make up
for the other night.

55:24.938 --> 55:28.899
Did you know I wanted to be a horse
trainer when I was a little girl?

55:28.983 --> 55:31.193
No. But I could have guessed.

55:31.276 --> 55:33.653
What happened?

55:33.778 --> 55:37.198
I had to take care of my sisters, and a
beginning horse trainer doesn't pay big bucks,

55:37.281 --> 55:40.742
so I took a job with the city
and another as a waitress.

55:40.867 --> 55:43.787
And there you go.
Steady pay checks.

55:43.870 --> 55:47.957
So why didn't you go back to it
after your sisters were okay?

55:50.459 --> 55:53.420
You know what? Let's do
something you want to do.

55:55.671 --> 55:57.673
Anything?

55:59.133 --> 56:02.385
Yeah, sure.

56:05.721 --> 56:08.933
I have to say, this is exactly
how I thought you'd be living.

56:09.058 --> 56:11.018
What, you got something
against pool?

56:11.143 --> 56:13.520
No, but a sofa wouldn't
kill you, would it?

56:15.021 --> 56:16.981
Uh-uh.

56:17.064 --> 56:19.108
Your turn.

56:19.191 --> 56:22.444
So how does
a meat delivery man...

56:22.569 --> 56:25.571
afford a nice place like this?

56:25.696 --> 56:27.907
He struggles and makes do.

56:28.032 --> 56:30.617
Did I tell you my boss and I are
going to the mayor's mansion...

56:30.742 --> 56:33.286
so we can show him cuts for
a private dinner he's having?

56:33.411 --> 56:35.580
You're doing a meat show
for the mayor?

56:35.663 --> 56:40.417
Meat presentation. There's a
subtle difference of humiliation.

56:40.500 --> 56:42.502
So you never did
answer my question:

56:42.586 --> 56:46.005
why you didn't go back into horse training
after your sisters got on their feet?

56:46.088 --> 56:49.758
I don't want to talk
about it, okay?

56:49.842 --> 56:52.761
It's hard to get to know someone
when they won't talk to you.

56:52.844 --> 56:55.471
You know, we're having a really
good time right now, Raymond.

56:55.555 --> 56:58.807
Let's just drop it, okay?

57:00.184 --> 57:02.561
Did you know...

57:03.978 --> 57:06.814
that I was an orphan
just like you and your sisters?

57:06.897 --> 57:10.984
My mom gave me up after I was born. I
don't think she even knew who my father was.

57:11.109 --> 57:14.028
Yeah, so that explains it,

57:14.112 --> 57:18.240
why the idea of staying
in one place scares you so much.

57:18.365 --> 57:21.743
Scares me? I said I was a multi
- talented guy that liked to travel.

57:21.868 --> 57:25.038
- I didn't say I was scared.
- I read about it.

57:25.163 --> 57:27.498
When a child is abandoned,

57:27.581 --> 57:31.126
he becomes afraid that his
entire life will fall apart again.

57:33.003 --> 57:35.755
I don't think
you should feel bad about it.

57:35.880 --> 57:38.507
It's a completely
natural reaction.

57:38.632 --> 57:42.219
Okay then. I won't
feel bad about it.

57:43.720 --> 57:47.223
What about you?

57:48.724 --> 57:50.392
Okay.

57:52.227 --> 57:55.313
Our parents died
in a car accident when I was 18.

57:55.396 --> 57:57.398
Insurance paid for the house,

57:57.481 --> 58:02.194
and we started a bank account
that we called the Dandridge fund.

58:02.277 --> 58:05.279
I guess as they grew older,

58:05.405 --> 58:08.657
I settled into this cushy
little life I have now.

58:08.782 --> 58:12.410
And I didn't wanna go back and chase
dreams of becoming a horse trainer.

58:12.577 --> 58:15.872
So I guess if it doesn't kill
you, it makes you stronger, huh?

58:15.997 --> 58:18.541
I think what people mean
when they say that...

58:18.624 --> 58:23.378
is that you deal with whatever pain that
you have by building a bridge over it...

58:23.503 --> 58:26.005
with all the things that life
hasn't taken away from you.

58:26.130 --> 58:28.716
So if it doesn't kill you,
it makes you build a bridge.

58:28.799 --> 58:32.510
Yeah. Yeah. That's good. I
like that. I'm gonna use that.

58:32.594 --> 58:33.887
You should be proud of yourself.

58:34.012 --> 58:36.722
No. I'm proud
of my sisters.

58:36.847 --> 58:41.768
What about you, Eva? I know
all that devotion cost you.

58:41.893 --> 58:44.562
It did.

58:44.687 --> 58:49.233
There was this guy,
Lucius Johnson. Lucius.

58:49.358 --> 58:52.485
Anyway, he was
our local Mr. Everything.

58:52.611 --> 58:56.113
You know. We were young,
but it was serious.

58:56.239 --> 59:00.909
We were gonna get married, and Ready for
the World was gonna sing at our wedding.

59:01.034 --> 59:06.247
But... he asked me to choose
between him and my sisters.

59:06.330 --> 59:10.709
And when I didn't choose him, he
dumped me. Why didn't you choose him?

59:10.792 --> 59:14.754
Because my sisters needed me more than
he did, and what I needed didn't matter.

59:14.921 --> 59:20.092
So, what about you, Raymond? What has
the tragedy in your life given you?

59:24.804 --> 59:27.598
You know!

59:27.681 --> 59:30.517
Just cough up the damn money
so I can get goin'.

59:34.479 --> 59:37.690
Uh, okay. I didn't mean
to interrupt.

59:37.815 --> 59:42.194
- Yeah, you never do, Mike.
- Pay you on the bet later, Mike.

59:42.319 --> 59:44.195
No problem, Ray.

59:44.320 --> 59:46.572
It's all good, baby.

59:46.697 --> 59:49.283
Mike's a lucky pool player.
That I am.

59:49.408 --> 59:52.827
Look, I'm gonna let you two
get back to your date.

59:52.911 --> 59:55.330
See you later.

01:00:01.418 --> 01:00:04.629
You know, Mike and his little
buddies are not fooling me.

01:00:04.754 --> 01:00:07.214
I didn't think so. No.
They set us up, you and me.

01:00:07.298 --> 01:00:10.092
They want us to date so
I'll stay out of their hair.

01:00:10.175 --> 01:00:14.721
You might not believe this. They
don't really like me very much.

01:00:14.804 --> 01:00:17.723
I didn't get that.
Really?

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:23.019
So, uh, do you mind that
they set you up with me?

01:00:25.396 --> 01:00:28.732
Just show me how to
hit the ball straight.

01:00:28.816 --> 01:00:31.318
You want me to show you how
to hit the ball straight? Yeah.

01:00:31.443 --> 01:00:33.445
First, hold
the stick straight.

01:00:33.528 --> 01:00:37.490
That's it. Now slide the
stick between your fingers.

01:00:40.701 --> 01:00:43.036
Eva never misses our night.

01:00:43.161 --> 01:00:45.288
Something must
have happened.

01:00:45.413 --> 01:00:49.333
- Maybe she had an accident.
- Oh, please. Eva would call from the ambulance.

01:00:51.168 --> 01:00:53.503
- Eva's with Ray.
- What?

01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:57.298
But... she hates him.
We all agreed.

01:00:57.423 --> 01:01:00.217
- How do you know that?
- She called me on her cell phone to say that...

01:01:00.342 --> 01:01:02.802
she and Ray were going
horseback riding.

01:01:02.886 --> 01:01:06.973
- I guess it went well. -
Horses? Three words: e- rot-ic.

01:01:07.056 --> 01:01:11.143
Horses make me feel
all tingly.

01:01:11.226 --> 01:01:13.686
Shut up. Shut up.

01:01:14.979 --> 01:01:16.939
Oh, my God.

01:01:18.315 --> 01:01:20.692
Eva has a man.

01:02:31.793 --> 01:02:34.379
- Hey, guys.
- Eva.

01:02:34.546 --> 01:02:36.714
Chi-town is calling you.

01:02:36.881 --> 01:02:38.924
Congratulations, Eva.

01:02:39.091 --> 01:02:42.636
I don't know what to say.
Um, wow.

01:02:42.761 --> 01:02:45.221
Can I have some time
to think about it?

01:02:45.346 --> 01:02:49.641
- Sure, but why? This is a great opportunity.
- I know, I know.

01:02:49.767 --> 01:02:52.394
A lot's changed in my life
since all this happened.

01:02:52.477 --> 01:02:55.313
I know how
relocation can be.

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:58.065
Take some time.
Thanks.

01:03:03.528 --> 01:03:08.907
Ray, you are the messiah.

01:03:08.991 --> 01:03:11.618
I haven't seen Eva
in a week, bro.

01:03:11.785 --> 01:03:14.912
And Kareenah and I are having baby
talk, my blood pressure's down,

01:03:15.038 --> 01:03:17.748
and fellas, I do believe
I am growing another penis.

01:03:17.832 --> 01:03:21.376
Eva's cool because Ray got
her into bed. Right, player?

01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:23.962
That's right. No, no.
We're just hanging out.

01:03:24.087 --> 01:03:27.506
- He's modest.
- Now you have to tell her you're moving to another state...

01:03:27.631 --> 01:03:29.591
so she can get out
of our lives forever.

01:03:29.675 --> 01:03:32.260
Yeah. Tell her you're going
to somewhere like Delaware.

01:03:32.385 --> 01:03:36.264
Can't nobody find that shit
on the map. I know I can't.

01:03:36.347 --> 01:03:39.933
- Do you have to be so gleeful about it?
- What did he say?

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:42.561
Hey, Ray, Ray, Ray,
Ray, Ray.

01:03:42.727 --> 01:03:46.147
- You gotta be tough. You gotta stay strong for all of us.
- Yeah.

01:03:46.272 --> 01:03:49.608
Men who get away with shit are the
backbones of this here country, Ray.

01:03:49.733 --> 01:03:52.485
Yeah, life, liberty and
getting away with shit, Ray.

01:03:54.571 --> 01:03:57.865
Did you know that Eva does charity
work, teaches Bible studies?

01:03:57.990 --> 01:04:01.785
She loves animals. She
rides this horse named Romeo.

01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:04.204
He reacts to her
like he understands.

01:04:04.329 --> 01:04:07.706
We didn't say she was a bad person.
We said she was an irritating person.

01:04:07.832 --> 01:04:10.125
Yeah, and that horse
is probably retarded, man.

01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:13.420
- I'm just saying-
- Just saying what, Ray?

01:04:13.545 --> 01:04:16.505
We had a deal, Ray.

01:04:16.631 --> 01:04:20.509
- Remember your motto?
Player first- - Women second.

01:04:20.592 --> 01:04:23.428
- Now, are you the man or what, Ray?
- Come on, Ray.

01:04:23.511 --> 01:04:26.430
You're not hearing me.
Are you the man or what, Ray?

01:04:28.015 --> 01:04:30.559
- You know I'm your man.
- Yeah! All right!

01:04:30.684 --> 01:04:33.228
That's a player.
I wasn't worried.

01:04:33.353 --> 01:04:35.813
That's my money working
right there.

01:05:09.383 --> 01:05:11.635
Eva, you flying solo
tonight?

01:05:11.718 --> 01:05:16.722
Yeah, my boyfriend Ray had some
kind of inventory thing tonight, so-

01:05:16.847 --> 01:05:19.475
So you given any thought
to the offer?

01:05:19.558 --> 01:05:21.810
I'm still thinking
about it, sir.

01:05:21.935 --> 01:05:26.189
Don't let me rush you, Eva.
We do have a small window here.

01:05:26.314 --> 01:05:29.233
I'll keep that in mind.
Thanks.

01:05:29.358 --> 01:05:31.902
Excuse me.

01:05:39.908 --> 01:05:41.868
Hi.

01:05:41.952 --> 01:05:44.204
Um, let me get a white wine
spritzer, please.

01:05:44.287 --> 01:05:46.330
You got it.

01:05:47.498 --> 01:05:49.917
Eva. Eva Dandridge?

01:05:50.042 --> 01:05:54.546
- Lucius?
- I thought that was you. How you been?

01:05:54.712 --> 01:05:58.549
I'm fine, Lucius.
It's nice to see you again.

01:05:58.632 --> 01:06:00.968
I want you to meet somebody.

01:06:01.093 --> 01:06:04.387
My wife, Renee.
Baby, this is Eva.

01:06:04.512 --> 01:06:09.350
- The one I told you about.
- Oh, the love of his life.

01:06:09.433 --> 01:06:12.894
I've heard so much about you.
I hate you.

01:06:12.978 --> 01:06:17.565
Yeah, Eva and I were engaged after
high school, but it didn't work out.

01:06:17.690 --> 01:06:21.902
- You dumped me, Lucius.
- Right. Didn't you have to go work for your baby sisters?

01:06:22.027 --> 01:06:24.028
Eva,you broke
Lucius's heart.

01:06:24.112 --> 01:06:27.490
Thank God you did though. Or
else I never would have got him.

01:06:29.533 --> 01:06:31.535
These are our kids.

01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:34.954
They're cute.
Real cute.

01:06:35.079 --> 01:06:39.458
I'm assistant to the mayor now.
Hired me right out of General Motors.

01:06:39.583 --> 01:06:42.210
At a very generous salary.

01:06:42.294 --> 01:06:46.214
- So, Eva, what is it that you do?
- I'm a health inspector.

01:06:48.757 --> 01:06:52.427
Great. So you go look at dirty
kitchens and public restrooms...

01:06:52.511 --> 01:06:54.304
and stufflike that?

01:06:54.429 --> 01:06:57.264
- Sounds fascinating, girl.
- It pays the bills, yeah.

01:06:57.390 --> 01:07:00.309
So where's your date?

01:07:00.475 --> 01:07:02.894
He's running late.

01:07:02.978 --> 01:07:04.979
Sorry, baby. I had that thing.

01:07:05.063 --> 01:07:07.606
You okay?
Yeah.

01:07:07.773 --> 01:07:09.733
Hi. Ray Adams.

01:07:09.817 --> 01:07:13.611
How you doing, man? Lucius
Johnson. My wife, Renee. Hello.

01:07:13.737 --> 01:07:16.864
Lucius. Heard a lot about you.

01:07:16.989 --> 01:07:19.033
- So how long you two been going out?
- Not long.

01:07:19.158 --> 01:07:22.827
I was in Africa on business. The city
is trading with the brothers over there.

01:07:22.953 --> 01:07:25.204
I came all the way back
to escort Eva.

01:07:27.623 --> 01:07:31.460
I had no idea the city of Los
Angeles was a trade partner in Africa.

01:07:31.543 --> 01:07:35.880
You wouldn't. It's on the
highest levels of city government.

01:07:36.005 --> 01:07:39.258
Really? Well, let's hear all
about this so-called trade program.

01:07:39.341 --> 01:07:43.636
Ray, shush. It's fun
time now. Mr. Mayor!

01:07:45.013 --> 01:07:46.931
Hey.

01:07:47.014 --> 01:07:50.017
Ray, how is my main man?
Good, sir. Good, good.

01:07:50.142 --> 01:07:52.102
Good to see you.
This is my date, Eva.

01:07:52.185 --> 01:07:54.854
So this is Eva?

01:07:54.979 --> 01:07:57.481
Ray, you didn't
do her justice.

01:07:58.732 --> 01:08:00.317
Thank you, sir.

01:08:06.030 --> 01:08:11.910
- And this is, uh, Lumpy and Reeses.
- Lucius and Renee, sir.

01:08:12.035 --> 01:08:14.829
I'm one of your new assistants and I thought that
- Ray.

01:08:14.954 --> 01:08:17.747
I want you to bring this beautiful
young lady up to the house sometime.

01:08:17.872 --> 01:08:19.832
Will do, sir.
Great to meet you.

01:08:19.917 --> 01:08:22.669
Nice to meet you too.
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

01:08:24.921 --> 01:08:27.381
Ray, my man.
I'm sorry about that-

01:08:27.465 --> 01:08:30.716
You can have a rain check
on kissing my ass, Leo.

01:08:30.841 --> 01:08:34.261
I have to dance
with the prettiest girl here.

01:08:34.386 --> 01:08:37.305
Right.
Good seeing you again, Eva.

01:08:38.557 --> 01:08:40.517
If you don't stop
staring at her,

01:08:40.684 --> 01:08:44.020
I'm gonna slap the taste
out of your mouth.

01:09:02.118 --> 01:09:06.872
Was that okay? The question
is, how did you do it?

01:09:06.956 --> 01:09:10.542
Well, first I got home
from work early,

01:09:10.667 --> 01:09:14.212
then I watched you from across the
room looking like you wanted to die.

01:09:14.379 --> 01:09:16.339
Okay. And what
about the mayor?

01:09:16.421 --> 01:09:19.925
I did a hell of a meat presentation
for him. Remember? That's right.

01:09:20.091 --> 01:09:22.511
He's a really nice guy.
I only had to beg him once.

01:09:22.594 --> 01:09:25.763
You know you look good
in that tux, right?

01:09:25.888 --> 01:09:27.848
Your hair looks fine.

01:09:27.932 --> 01:09:30.725
Thank you. Bethany did it.
Really?

01:09:30.809 --> 01:09:34.229
I should go by there one day. No.
Promise me you will not go in there.

01:09:34.312 --> 01:09:36.647
Okay. Okay.

01:09:38.439 --> 01:09:40.734
You know, you're a good dancer.

01:09:42.152 --> 01:09:45.654
You know. Body movement's
my specialty.

01:09:49.408 --> 01:09:51.201
Smooth.

01:09:51.283 --> 01:09:54.078
You know, they once banned
dipping in some countries...

01:09:54.203 --> 01:09:57.123
because it was considered
a form of foreplay.

01:09:57.248 --> 01:09:59.875
I didn't know that.

01:10:02.085 --> 01:10:05.046
Okay.

01:10:05.129 --> 01:10:08.716
You learn something new
every day, huh? Yeah.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:10.300
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:12.427
How long do you
wanna stay here?
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:12.427 --> 01:10:12.511
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:12.511 --> 01:10:15.430
After watching Lucius grovel,
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.513
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:15.513 --> 01:10:17.473
not long.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:17.473 --> 01:10:18.807
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:18.807 --> 01:10:20.767
What you wanna do?
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:20.767 --> 01:10:21.893
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:21.893 --> 01:10:22.000
Something fun.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.895
Something fun.

01:10:33.903 --> 01:10:36.364
Nice sofa.

01:10:36.489 --> 01:10:39.366
I bought it just for you.

01:10:39.491 --> 01:10:41.451
Just a second.
Let me get this off.

01:10:41.535 --> 01:10:44.495
No, Eva. Don't take
your clothes off.

01:10:44.579 --> 01:10:47.498
You wanna do it with them on? I'm
into that. Let me hike this up.

01:10:47.623 --> 01:10:51.460
No. No, no, no, no.
I can't do this.

01:10:51.543 --> 01:10:55.129
The bulge in your pants
didn't get that memo, so-

01:10:55.296 --> 01:10:58.174
No, no, no, no. I- I need
to tell you something.

01:10:58.299 --> 01:11:02.469
Yes. Whatever it is, yes. Yes. No, look.

01:11:02.594 --> 01:11:05.013
I don't wanna move too fast.

01:11:05.138 --> 01:11:08.599
Fast? No. The average American couple
has sex on their third date, and...

01:11:08.682 --> 01:11:13.478
we have been dating way,
way, way longer than that.

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:15.563
I just-

01:11:15.688 --> 01:11:18.023
Look, you've been through
so much stuff with men.

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:20.317
And I don't wanna mess things
up. I want it to be perfect.

01:11:20.442 --> 01:11:22.444
I just think
we should wait a while.

01:11:24.154 --> 01:11:27.073
I have to respect that,
don't I?

01:11:27.198 --> 01:11:29.783
Yeah, I guess you do.

01:11:31.326 --> 01:11:33.453
I have to go.

01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:38.290
Please, don't be mad at me.
No, I'm not. It's just-

01:11:38.415 --> 01:11:42.419
I just never had a guy who cared so
much about my feelings. It's kind of-

01:11:42.544 --> 01:11:45.463
Oooh. It's making me
want you even more.

01:11:45.546 --> 01:11:47.548
And if I don't leave
right now,

01:11:47.673 --> 01:11:50.467
I'm gonna start saying all kinds
of hot, nasty, dirty things.

01:11:50.551 --> 01:11:53.345
How hot and nasty?
Real freaky.

01:11:53.470 --> 01:11:55.513
Go. Go.
Oh, God. Okay.

01:11:55.638 --> 01:11:59.516
Stay.
Yeah? Oh, God.

01:12:00.642 --> 01:12:02.435
No.
Okay.

01:12:04.312 --> 01:12:06.272
Look-

01:12:32.210 --> 01:12:34.212
Yes!

01:12:49.391 --> 01:12:51.643
Oh, my God.

01:12:51.727 --> 01:12:54.312
Did I hurt you?
Yes.

01:12:54.395 --> 01:12:56.397
But I liked it.
Yeah?

01:12:58.524 --> 01:13:01.193
Maybe next time we'll
actually make it to the bed.

01:13:01.276 --> 01:13:04.487
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:13:04.571 --> 01:13:07.281
That was good.

01:13:07.406 --> 01:13:09.658
Ray,

01:13:09.783 --> 01:13:14.245
I wanted to say, the stuff I said
before, I just wanted to apologize.

01:13:14.370 --> 01:13:16.998
I mean, how I acted.

01:13:17.081 --> 01:13:20.542
That was
a beautiful apology.

01:13:20.626 --> 01:13:23.712
The best part was when
you called me Ray.

01:13:23.795 --> 01:13:27.381
That's 'cause there's not a lot of
need to be formal right about now.

01:13:27.465 --> 01:13:30.050
'Cause I'm a big ho.

01:13:30.134 --> 01:13:32.093
If you really wanna make
it up to me, tell me a joke.

01:13:32.177 --> 01:13:35.763
No. I'm not a good joke teller. I'm
terrible. That's what makes it so special.

01:13:37.723 --> 01:13:41.560
Okay. Oh, God.
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:13:41.727 --> 01:13:44.187
Okay. Okay.

01:13:44.312 --> 01:13:47.356
This guy goes
to a zoo, right?

01:13:47.481 --> 01:13:50.234
You're gonna like it.
Okay, he goes to a zoo.

01:13:50.359 --> 01:13:53.862
And he sees this gorilla.
Okay.

01:13:53.945 --> 01:13:58.407
Okay. And he says to the gorilla, "Yo, brother. Can you give."

01:13:58.490 --> 01:14:01.868
No. He says,
"Yo, brother. Can you loan-"

01:14:01.952 --> 01:14:04.037
Yeah. "Yo, brother.
Can you loan me a dollar?"

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:08.707
And the gorilla says,
"That's why I don't wear pants."

01:14:08.791 --> 01:14:11.918
Right.
Oh, my God.

01:14:12.002 --> 01:14:14.796
Don't you get it?
The pants and the gorilla.

01:14:14.963 --> 01:14:17.840
Yeah. Best joke
I ever heard.

01:14:17.965 --> 01:14:21.134
Best joke I ever heard.
I forgot about that joke.

01:14:21.259 --> 01:14:25.138
Oh, my God.
Oh, my goodness.

01:14:28.599 --> 01:14:31.143
Ray?
Hmm?

01:14:31.268 --> 01:14:33.937
Thinking about what you told me
about your parents.

01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:39.566
God, I mean, my folks died, but I
had my sisters to live for, you know?

01:14:39.650 --> 01:14:41.777
I just think it might be-

01:14:41.902 --> 01:14:45.905
it might be easier for you to get
over your fear of building a life...

01:14:45.988 --> 01:14:48.741
if you had someone there
to help you do it.

01:14:48.866 --> 01:14:51.284
I see.

01:14:51.368 --> 01:14:53.328
You wanna be my bridge.

01:14:53.453 --> 01:14:56.872
It's not like I wanna get
married to you or anything.

01:14:58.582 --> 01:15:02.127
I can- I can be a really
good friend, that's all.

01:15:03.962 --> 01:15:07.923
You give me your body, and then
you offer me your friendship?

01:15:08.048 --> 01:15:10.300
My priorities are straight.
Thank you very much.

01:15:10.425 --> 01:15:13.928
I'm offering you
the best of me right now.

01:15:14.012 --> 01:15:17.598
Eva.

01:15:17.681 --> 01:15:20.642
I'm not the person
you think I am.

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:27.773
I know most women think their
man is the one that's different.

01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:31.318
None of us are different.

01:15:31.401 --> 01:15:33.987
I'm just like other men.

01:15:35.822 --> 01:15:37.782
Maybe not as good as most.

01:15:37.907 --> 01:15:41.034
I want you to think about what it
would take to build a bridge with me.

01:15:45.038 --> 01:15:50.167
I can handle it, Ray. Okay?
I can handle it.

01:15:50.292 --> 01:15:55.129
As long as you keep giving
me what I need, I am good.

01:15:55.254 --> 01:15:57.506
You got all you want?
Yeah.

01:15:57.631 --> 01:16:00.842
That. That.
A whole lot of that.

01:16:00.926 --> 01:16:03.970
A lot of that?
A lot of that.

01:16:04.053 --> 01:16:06.180
And all the other stuff too.

01:16:08.641 --> 01:16:10.601
You hear me?

01:16:10.726 --> 01:16:13.645
How can I turn down
a deal like that?

01:16:14.979 --> 01:16:16.939
You can't.

01:16:18.065 --> 01:16:20.025
Can you?

01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:26.155
What's up?

01:16:26.239 --> 01:16:28.407
Hey, girl. Nice shoes.

01:16:28.574 --> 01:16:30.909
Ormandy. You look good.

01:16:31.034 --> 01:16:34.996
Telly, baby,
give me some love.

01:16:35.163 --> 01:16:37.832
Eva, what has gotten
into you?

01:16:37.915 --> 01:16:41.168
- Not "what," "who."
- What are you wearing?

01:16:41.251 --> 01:16:44.045
- Eva, you're glowing.
- What did you do?

01:16:44.129 --> 01:16:46.506
Shit, I ain't sharing
my "bidness" with you.

01:16:46.589 --> 01:16:50.717
- Oh, my God. She said "shit. "
- And "bidness."

01:16:50.801 --> 01:16:56.180
- She gone mad to her ass.
- Y'all need to stop trippin'. I'm just in a good mood.

01:16:56.264 --> 01:17:00.976
It's a beautiful day out. I'm with my
girls. Stop sweatin' me. My joints is hot.

01:17:01.101 --> 01:17:03.728
And my cakes is moist.

01:17:03.895 --> 01:17:06.939
Can a sister get some water, or
a fan or iceberg or something?

01:17:07.106 --> 01:17:11.026
- Okay, Eva, for real. You're scaring me.
- Did you and Ray do it or not?

01:17:11.151 --> 01:17:13.111
Well,

01:17:13.236 --> 01:17:15.697
he did show up
at the mayor's fund- raiser.

01:17:15.822 --> 01:17:20.659
Just when I was trapped
by Lucius Johnson...

01:17:20.784 --> 01:17:22.744
and his wife.

01:17:22.869 --> 01:17:25.371
- You saw Lucius? What did you do?
- Nothing. Ray did it.

01:17:25.455 --> 01:17:27.748
He put that little sucker
in his place.

01:17:27.832 --> 01:17:30.584
Excuse me, is there
like some, um, boning...

01:17:30.667 --> 01:17:33.920
or salad tossing or something
in this story? Stop it.

01:17:34.045 --> 01:17:38.257
Come on.
Okay. After he rescued me,

01:17:38.382 --> 01:17:41.301
we danced all night long.

01:17:41.426 --> 01:17:43.970
Slow, close,

01:17:44.095 --> 01:17:46.305
just pelvis to pelvis.

01:17:47.681 --> 01:17:49.516
And then we went back
to my place...

01:17:49.641 --> 01:17:52.227
and had a nice
respectable evening.

01:17:53.937 --> 01:17:56.105
And then we burned
a hole in the floor!

01:18:00.484 --> 01:18:04.279
Wow. There's my baby.
Let's get freaky- deaky.

01:18:04.362 --> 01:18:06.489
Come on, to the bedroom.
Follow me.

01:18:06.614 --> 01:18:10.200
You know what Eva told me?
Here we go.

01:18:10.325 --> 01:18:14.370
She told me that Ray drives his
old van from his job to save money.

01:18:14.496 --> 01:18:17.123
So what? I mean, what's that
got to do with freaky-deaky?

01:18:17.206 --> 01:18:19.875
I don't feel like
I sacrifice like Ray does.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.086
You know, when I need to get
back into being focused on school.

01:18:23.169 --> 01:18:27.298
Look. First off, Ray and
Eva, they ain't you and me.

01:18:27.423 --> 01:18:29.258
I know that.
They're not married.

01:18:29.341 --> 01:18:32.552
They ain't phone-boning. They're
not having sex. None of that.

01:18:32.677 --> 01:18:34.804
Actually, they do have sex.

01:18:34.929 --> 01:18:37.765
He hit that?
Mm-hmm.

01:18:37.848 --> 01:18:40.267
And from what I hear,

01:18:40.392 --> 01:18:43.812
you could take a little lesson
from him in that department.

01:18:46.022 --> 01:18:47.982
What the-

01:18:48.107 --> 01:18:50.984
What's that supposed to mean?
He got some tricks and shit?

01:18:51.109 --> 01:18:53.361
I seen the dude
lickin' his lips and stuff.

01:18:53.486 --> 01:18:57.782
Come on, sexy. Let's play doctor.
Tim, listen to me, all right?

01:18:57.865 --> 01:19:01.159
I have been thinking a lot
about Ray and Eva.

01:19:01.243 --> 01:19:03.912
And how they have this wonderful
new relationship, right?

01:19:04.037 --> 01:19:06.998
And it's made me think about myself
and the plan that I had for my life...

01:19:07.081 --> 01:19:09.041
and how I let it go.

01:19:09.166 --> 01:19:12.460
What? But, baby,
I threw all my condoms out.

01:19:12.544 --> 01:19:14.337
Honey.
Ohh.

01:19:14.462 --> 01:19:16.964
I'll get you some more.
They're on sale at Target.

01:19:17.131 --> 01:19:19.091
Come on, Kareenah!
Sweetie, listen.

01:19:19.216 --> 01:19:23.094
I am ready. Baby, I am so damn fertile
that if you kiss me you'll get pregnant.

01:19:23.219 --> 01:19:25.680
This isn't like buying a coat.
If you have a baby,

01:19:25.763 --> 01:19:28.140
you can't give it back
if you don't want it.

01:19:30.017 --> 01:19:33.103
Who said that, Ray or
Eva? I don't remember.

01:19:34.979 --> 01:19:37.481
Honey, why is my potpourri
on the bed?

01:19:37.565 --> 01:19:39.566
See-
Get the DustBuster.

01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:42.527
It was- I was gonna-
It's hot in here.

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:45.571
Baby, I thought we've
been through this already.

01:19:45.655 --> 01:19:48.157
Ray and Eva have a good relationship
and they don't cohabitate.

01:19:48.324 --> 01:19:52.077
Oh, my God. That's all I've been
hearing lately. Ray and Eva. Ray and Eva.

01:19:52.202 --> 01:19:56.664
It's not like they're Will
and Jada or George and Weezy.

01:19:56.789 --> 01:20:00.417
They each have their own place.
They have respect for each other.

01:20:00.542 --> 01:20:04.504
Ray doesn't even
care about Eva. I paid-

01:20:04.629 --> 01:20:07.548
I paid close attention to him.
He does not like her.

01:20:07.631 --> 01:20:09.633
Sure. That's why Ray
calls her every day.

01:20:09.758 --> 01:20:11.927
That's why they have lunch
together three times a week.

01:20:12.052 --> 01:20:16.389
That's why Eva's thinking about
passing on a new job to stay. What job?

01:20:16.472 --> 01:20:19.016
Eva was offered
a new job in Chicago.

01:20:19.099 --> 01:20:21.518
But she's gonna say no
because she found Ray.

01:20:21.643 --> 01:20:25.730
- Ain't that a- - But here's
something that'll make you happy.

01:20:25.855 --> 01:20:30.275
- We're dissolving the Dandridge fund.
- Really? That's great.

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.569
- Eva's gonna keep it all.
- What?

01:20:32.652 --> 01:20:37.406
You know. She has a new life, a new man.
She's gonna need that money. Okay, baby.

01:20:37.531 --> 01:20:42.244
Here's all your stuff. Let
yourself out, okay? Love you.

01:21:40.334 --> 01:21:43.670
Is there something wrong?

01:21:43.795 --> 01:21:47.423
I took your advice and convinced
my boss to let me run his company.

01:21:47.506 --> 01:21:49.675
He told me I could
start next week.

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:53.803
He did? That's great.
Congratulations.

01:21:56.347 --> 01:21:59.266
That's good news, right?

01:21:59.350 --> 01:22:01.935
Yeah.

01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:04.521
You made me realize
I can't run from myself.

01:22:04.604 --> 01:22:07.982
It's like someone gave me
a pair of glasses...

01:22:08.107 --> 01:22:11.318
that filter out all the foolishness
and stupidity in my life.

01:22:11.443 --> 01:22:14.279
What have I given you
for that gift, Eva?

01:22:14.362 --> 01:22:17.573
Nothing.

01:22:17.698 --> 01:22:20.284
You taught me how to trust again,
Ray. I wouldn't call that nothing.

01:22:23.244 --> 01:22:27.707
And you've helped me come
to a decision of my own.

01:22:27.790 --> 01:22:30.209
What?

01:22:31.376 --> 01:22:33.169
Baby, if you're
gonna be here,

01:22:36.255 --> 01:22:40.175
then this is exactly
where I wanna be.

01:23:00.734 --> 01:23:03.737
Crossed the line with
Eva, didn't you, Ray? No.

01:23:03.862 --> 01:23:05.988
Don't lie, you lyin'
bald- headed son of a bitch.

01:23:06.114 --> 01:23:08.115
All I did was what
you paid me for.

01:23:08.199 --> 01:23:10.867
And now that Eva's in a relationship,
our women are even worse.

01:23:11.034 --> 01:23:13.286
Everything that you do
comes back on us.

01:23:13.370 --> 01:23:15.663
And Eva's keeping
all the money, Ray.

01:23:15.747 --> 01:23:18.499
That's not my fault. Like
hell it ain't your fault, Ray!

01:23:18.624 --> 01:23:22.752
Something's wrong with you, Ray. You've
been having too much damn fun with Eva.

01:23:22.877 --> 01:23:24.837
You haven't asked for any
expenses lately. Why's that?

01:23:24.921 --> 01:23:27.423
You pay for the woman.
You must like the woman.

01:23:27.548 --> 01:23:31.927
That's ridiculous. I'm a player. I'm on
the job. What's in the garment bag, Ray?

01:23:32.052 --> 01:23:35.388
Nothing. A suit.
I got a promotion at work.

01:23:35.513 --> 01:23:39.808
A promotion? That is Eva
all the way. No, that's me.

01:23:39.892 --> 01:23:42.644
Then what the hell is this?
Tupperware.

01:23:42.769 --> 01:23:44.854
That's Eva's middle name.

01:23:45.021 --> 01:23:47.440
I just needed
to organize a few things.

01:23:47.565 --> 01:23:50.025
Organization is Eva's
second middle name.

01:23:50.109 --> 01:23:52.694
Look, Eva got a job offer
in Chicago.

01:23:52.777 --> 01:23:56.280
You're gonna dump her. That way, she
has no reason to stay here, get it?

01:23:56.405 --> 01:23:59.366
Yes. Say "yes," Ray.
She's staying because of me?

01:23:59.450 --> 01:24:03.078
Uh-uh. She's staying because
you boned her. You boned her!

01:24:03.203 --> 01:24:06.622
We know all about it, partner. And
that is like stealing from your job.

01:24:06.747 --> 01:24:10.209
You have embezzled the booty. Now, look.

01:24:10.334 --> 01:24:13.920
You're gonna call her tomorrow,
and you're gonna tell her it's over.

01:24:14.087 --> 01:24:16.714
No. He did not just say "no," did he?

01:24:16.839 --> 01:24:21.259
- No, I said "no."
- Listen, now! Hold up for a second!

01:24:21.426 --> 01:24:24.220
You're supposed to be a master
player. You forgot the rules.

01:24:24.345 --> 01:24:28.057
Players don't feel. That's like a
pimp with a health plan, brother.

01:24:28.182 --> 01:24:31.143
Mike, where did you find
this big-ass bamba, man?

01:24:31.268 --> 01:24:35.021
You done went from DMX to Babyface
on us, man. What's up with that?

01:24:35.104 --> 01:24:38.983
Wait. They done gave you
a copy of their theme song.

01:24:39.108 --> 01:24:41.693
They done made you an
orange. Okay, okay, look.

01:24:41.777 --> 01:24:44.529
I'm sorry. I do like her,
all right?

01:24:44.612 --> 01:24:48.866
I had to open my heart to get to her,
and when I did, she got to me first.

01:24:50.492 --> 01:24:53.161
- I think I might love her.
- Love?

01:24:53.286 --> 01:24:57.081
Love is an excuse, an alibi,
a justification for sex.

01:24:57.164 --> 01:25:01.168
But it is not something that should
stop a man from keeping his promise, Ray.

01:25:01.293 --> 01:25:04.295
Look. I'm sorry, fellas.

01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:06.797
I'm going to
see Eva tonight,

01:25:06.923 --> 01:25:09.258
and the least I can do is
tell her in person what I did.

01:25:09.383 --> 01:25:11.343
So... that's it.

01:25:13.136 --> 01:25:14.679
What?

01:25:14.804 --> 01:25:17.473
Come on. Let's go.

01:25:17.598 --> 01:25:19.558
Mike. Mike!

01:25:22.561 --> 01:25:25.897
So, is she real good, man? Does
she have some methods that she did?

01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:29.024
'Cause I'm trying
to getJacqui-

01:25:42.494 --> 01:25:44.787
Ha!

01:25:50.501 --> 01:25:52.294
This is bull-

01:25:55.171 --> 01:25:59.008
Thank you, Thomas.
No problem.

01:25:59.133 --> 01:26:01.802
I need to get up out of here so y'all
can get back to dissin' us brothers.

01:26:01.927 --> 01:26:05.096
I know how y'all is.
Excuse us?

01:26:05.179 --> 01:26:07.390
Aw, man. Y'all females
be trippin', man.

01:26:07.515 --> 01:26:09.558
Look. First y'all
drive men away,

01:26:09.683 --> 01:26:12.227
then y'all wanna bitch and moan
when y'all ain't got one.

01:26:12.352 --> 01:26:14.270
Hold up. Hold up.
Code 12.

01:26:14.354 --> 01:26:17.857
You know why I complain,
Thomas?

01:26:17.982 --> 01:26:21.443
- 'Cause I need a real man.
- Here we go.

01:26:21.526 --> 01:26:25.363
I need a real man,
not a child or a boy.

01:26:25.488 --> 01:26:29.450
Give me a hard rock, not
a soft little toy. Wow.

01:26:29.575 --> 01:26:34.287
You think women are hard?
You think we're evil and mean?

01:26:34.370 --> 01:26:37.790
- Well, I think maybe you don't need us.
- Maybe you on the wrong team.

01:26:40.876 --> 01:26:45.046
So I need a real man,
and my standards are high.

01:26:45.171 --> 01:26:49.091
Don't like what you just heard?
Then you need not apply.

01:26:56.597 --> 01:27:00.100
Wait a second. Fresh meat.

01:27:00.225 --> 01:27:02.769
Come on.
Leave 'em alone, ladies.

01:27:02.894 --> 01:27:06.939
Mike. Honey, is something
wrong? I got some bad news.

01:27:07.064 --> 01:27:10.192
It's, uh- It's about Ray.

01:27:10.275 --> 01:27:13.153
Ray!
My Ray?

01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:23.328
What- Is he okay?

01:27:41.635 --> 01:27:45.096
Some story, huh?
Well, it's not quite complete.

01:27:45.179 --> 01:27:49.308
We got three hours before the funeral,
fellas. Is all the food and water okay?

01:27:49.433 --> 01:27:52.644
Everything is okay. Darrell,
where did you find this place?

01:27:52.769 --> 01:27:56.189
This is an old postal storage
warehouse, but we don't use it anymore,

01:27:56.314 --> 01:27:59.650
not till now.

01:27:59.775 --> 01:28:03.278
Look here, Ray. You got everything
you need. You even have two bathrooms.

01:28:03.403 --> 01:28:06.405
Bucket number one,
and bucket number two.

01:28:06.531 --> 01:28:10.659
You'll be a little gamey in a
few days, but you'll be alive.

01:28:10.784 --> 01:28:13.995
This won't work. Oh, yes
it will, baby muscles.

01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:18.499
See, you've died in a car accident
according to this police report.

01:28:18.624 --> 01:28:20.584
Show him. Right here.
Yeah, yeah.

01:28:20.667 --> 01:28:23.712
Eva needed to know that your
body was immediately cremated.

01:28:23.795 --> 01:28:26.756
What about my family? Did you
think about that, smart guys?

01:28:26.839 --> 01:28:31.218
You ain't got no relatives, Ray, and very
little friends, thanks to your job-hopping.

01:28:31.301 --> 01:28:36.013
And Eva took that job in Chi-town
after she found out you were dead.

01:28:36.139 --> 01:28:38.557
It's not fair for you to
make her leave under a lie.

01:28:38.641 --> 01:28:42.519
It wasn't fair for you
to screw us on that deal.

01:28:42.644 --> 01:28:46.314
No, Ray. Let him go.
Let him go!

01:28:47.648 --> 01:28:50.275
Come on. Fellas,
fellas, fellas, listen.

01:28:50.359 --> 01:28:54.362
Listen. Maybe we need to just think
about this for one minute, all right?

01:28:54.487 --> 01:28:57.448
No, you think about this.
It's our word against his.

01:28:57.531 --> 01:29:00.909
By the time he tells Eva the
truth, she'll be long gone.

01:29:00.993 --> 01:29:06.080
And then we can say we didn't know anything
about this sick joke that he played on her.

01:29:06.164 --> 01:29:08.499
What the hell are you doing
falling in love with Eva?

01:29:08.624 --> 01:29:12.294
I think it's 'cause she got some good booty,
man. See all that aggression he got in him?

01:29:12.419 --> 01:29:15.755
That's 'cause he ain't
gettin' none. Let's go.

01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:17.965
Come on, Tim.

01:29:18.132 --> 01:29:20.259
Tim, come on!

01:29:23.470 --> 01:29:27.556
First of all, I'd like to thank
all of you for coming today.

01:29:27.682 --> 01:29:31.560
You know, Ray and I didn't
really know each other very long,

01:29:31.685 --> 01:29:35.688
but... in that short amount
of time,

01:29:36.939 --> 01:29:39.733
we became really close.

01:29:39.858 --> 01:29:44.112
You know, when someone
enters your life,you-

01:29:44.195 --> 01:29:46.280
you don't really know
how it changes you...

01:29:47.698 --> 01:29:49.658
until they're gone.

01:29:49.742 --> 01:29:52.244
I thought you said this was
gonna be a simple funeral.

01:29:52.369 --> 01:29:54.370
Who are all these people?

01:29:54.454 --> 01:29:56.914
Eva. She invited
all her friends from work.

01:29:57.039 --> 01:29:59.249
Where the hell does
Eva work at, Soul Train?

01:29:59.375 --> 01:30:01.626
Look at all these black
people in here. It's packed.

01:30:01.710 --> 01:30:04.837
Look.Just hang in there.
It's gonna be okay. I promise.

01:30:06.005 --> 01:30:08.465
I've, uh,

01:30:08.591 --> 01:30:12.344
invited my friend Valerie
from my church choir...

01:30:13.219 --> 01:30:15.430
to sing a song.

01:31:38.916 --> 01:31:40.626
Eva!

01:31:45.797 --> 01:31:47.590
Lord, it's a miracle.

01:31:51.843 --> 01:31:55.138
Oh, my God. Baby.

01:31:55.263 --> 01:31:59.224
What happened? Oh, my God.

01:31:59.308 --> 01:32:02.978
This whole thing was a lie.
It's all a lie.

01:32:03.144 --> 01:32:07.690
No, I wasn't in on this, okay?
Y'all did this on your own.

01:32:12.486 --> 01:32:16.614
Tim, Mike and Darrell...
faked my death...

01:32:17.823 --> 01:32:20.117
so that you'd leave town.
That's a lie!

01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:24.621
Eva, he wanted to dump you, but he didn't
have the guts to tell you face-to-face.

01:32:24.704 --> 01:32:27.039
That's what happened. Mm-hmm. Ray?

01:32:28.666 --> 01:32:31.043
Is that true?

01:32:32.169 --> 01:32:35.088
No, it isn't.
Don't, Tim!

01:32:35.213 --> 01:32:37.298
- Please!
- It's over.

01:32:37.465 --> 01:32:41.093
Eva, we did take Ray.

01:32:43.094 --> 01:32:44.971
And we lied about him
being dead.

01:32:45.096 --> 01:32:50.309
This is the best funeral I've ever
been to in my life. You got that right.

01:32:50.392 --> 01:32:52.519
I'm sorry.

01:32:52.644 --> 01:32:55.313
It's not their fault.
Like hell it isn't.

01:32:55.396 --> 01:32:57.982
You three...

01:32:58.065 --> 01:33:00.859
have yet to feel my rage.

01:33:00.984 --> 01:33:03.445
Eva,you don't understand.

01:33:04.696 --> 01:33:06.697
It's because of me.

01:33:06.822 --> 01:33:10.117
The only reason
I went out with you...

01:33:10.242 --> 01:33:12.953
is because they paid me to.

01:33:16.372 --> 01:33:20.250
I was supposed to...
make you like me,

01:33:20.375 --> 01:33:22.836
then trick you
into moving away.

01:33:22.961 --> 01:33:25.171
But I didn't know you then.

01:33:25.254 --> 01:33:29.508
I didn't realize
how wonderful you are.

01:33:29.633 --> 01:33:32.636
How much you changed me,
make me wanna change.

01:33:34.387 --> 01:33:37.515
I know I was wrong,
but...

01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:40.309
what we have is bigger
than all the mistakes I've made.

01:33:40.392 --> 01:33:42.894
I'm certain of that.

01:33:44.812 --> 01:33:46.981
How much did they pay you?

01:33:50.109 --> 01:33:52.360
Eva, that's not-
How much?

01:33:56.405 --> 01:33:58.574
Five thousand dollars.

01:33:58.699 --> 01:34:02.577
But, Eva, I'm giving them
that money back, and I promise-

01:34:05.038 --> 01:34:08.082
Oooh!

01:34:09.541 --> 01:34:13.086
You are exactly
who I thought you were.

01:34:22.886 --> 01:34:27.598
So, I guess
you're single now, huh?

01:34:27.723 --> 01:34:29.725
Excuse me.

01:35:04.254 --> 01:35:06.130
Police!

01:35:06.255 --> 01:35:08.632
Eva, please. Let me
have a minute. Stalker!

01:35:08.757 --> 01:35:13.303
Sixty seconds, Eva. Okay,
okay, one minute. Go, Raymond.

01:35:13.428 --> 01:35:16.931
Raymond? How did I get all
the way back to Raymond? Right.

01:35:17.056 --> 01:35:19.099
I don't want you
to stop being mad.

01:35:19.224 --> 01:35:21.393
I understand how you feel.

01:35:21.518 --> 01:35:24.479
I'm upset, too,
at myself.

01:35:24.604 --> 01:35:28.983
But we need to remember what we're
losing here. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

01:35:29.108 --> 01:35:31.068
I know you still have
feelings for me.

01:35:31.193 --> 01:35:34.154
I have feelings for you.

01:35:34.279 --> 01:35:38.699
Life is hard, Eva. We both
passed up on a lot of good things.

01:35:38.824 --> 01:35:41.660
We are too wise
for that now.

01:35:41.785 --> 01:35:46.539
I am never, ever gonna find
another woman like you.

01:35:48.457 --> 01:35:51.251
I love you.

01:35:55.838 --> 01:35:57.882
You know what I learned
about love, Raymond?

01:35:58.048 --> 01:36:00.592
It isn't a virus that
infects you. It's a choice.

01:36:00.759 --> 01:36:05.888
We choose to be in love, and
we choose what love makes us do.

01:36:05.972 --> 01:36:09.767
I earned your choice,
and you stole mine.

01:36:11.810 --> 01:36:14.270
I was ready to give up
my entire life for you,

01:36:14.354 --> 01:36:17.565
and all you were
ready to do was let me.

01:36:17.648 --> 01:36:19.942
So are you sure?

01:36:20.025 --> 01:36:22.235
Are you sure you love me?

01:36:22.319 --> 01:36:24.696
Or are you just upset that...

01:36:24.821 --> 01:36:26.781
I found out what you were...

01:36:26.864 --> 01:36:30.784
and... made a different choice?

01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:39.792
That's what I thought.
Excuse me, I have travel plans.

01:36:42.878 --> 01:36:44.921
What's up, fellas?

01:36:46.839 --> 01:36:50.467
Eva, you don't
have to rub it in.

01:36:50.592 --> 01:36:55.888
We've been trying to apologize to your
sisters for weeks. They still hate us.

01:36:56.013 --> 01:36:58.807
My sisters love you.

01:37:00.684 --> 01:37:04.062
They love you so much.

01:37:04.187 --> 01:37:09.942
I was just a distraction
and a huge pain in the ass.

01:37:10.025 --> 01:37:12.360
And I am so sorry.

01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:17.156
We dissolved the Dandridge fund
and split it up yesterday.

01:37:31.918 --> 01:37:35.129
Let's go home.
Let's get out of here.

01:37:35.254 --> 01:37:37.506
And I can read you a book.

01:37:37.631 --> 01:37:40.259
Yeah. As long as
it's not a scary book.

01:37:40.384 --> 01:37:43.011
I don't like scary books.

01:37:47.390 --> 01:37:50.767
Maybe we could have
some, uh- some make-up sex.

01:37:50.893 --> 01:37:53.603
Don't worry.
I have plenty of protection.

01:37:55.396 --> 01:37:57.690
We don't need it.

01:38:05.071 --> 01:38:09.199
I wanna do this right now
before I lose my nerve.

01:38:12.744 --> 01:38:14.537
What are you doing?

01:38:14.621 --> 01:38:19.708
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.

01:38:19.792 --> 01:38:22.210
Will you?
Yes.

01:38:26.797 --> 01:38:29.008
Congratulations.

01:38:29.091 --> 01:38:32.177
You know what? We should all go to dinner. Eva, let's
- Yeah.

01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:57.323
Holy mother of God.

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:02.077
Hey, Eva!

01:39:08.916 --> 01:39:11.084
Whoa. Whoa.

01:39:22.135 --> 01:39:24.596
I quit my job, sold my
house and bought him.

01:39:24.679 --> 01:39:28.224
You shouldn't have.
I can't be bought.

01:39:28.307 --> 01:39:32.185
I got him a home in a stable just
outside of town. It's paid up for a year.

01:39:32.310 --> 01:39:35.104
Are you even
listening to me?

01:39:35.188 --> 01:39:37.690
Yes. Now you listen to me.

01:39:37.815 --> 01:39:40.859
You said love is a
choice. Well, I love you.

01:39:40.984 --> 01:39:45.029
And I'm not leaving. I'm gonna
show up at your job every day.

01:39:45.154 --> 01:39:47.156
I'm gonna send you gifts,
and tell you I'm sorry...

01:39:47.281 --> 01:39:51.702
until you understand that
I will not live without you.

01:39:51.827 --> 01:39:54.954
Or until you call
the cops on me, but...

01:39:55.079 --> 01:39:57.498
even that won't stop me.

01:39:59.708 --> 01:40:01.710
Excuse me, ma'am.
Is this your animal?

01:40:07.673 --> 01:40:10.134
Yes, Officer.
This is my horse.

01:40:11.885 --> 01:40:14.137
My horse.

01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:24.479
You're gonna have
to move him off the street.

01:40:36.239 --> 01:40:38.282
Will you buy
a horse for me?

01:40:38.365 --> 01:40:41.952
No.

01:44:49.408 --> 01:44:51.493
Hello, is Linda there?

01:44:52.661 --> 01:44:54.329
Hey, babe.

01:44:54.454 --> 01:44:56.706
Listen, I'll pick you up
over on Fairfax.

01:44:58.415 --> 01:45:00.375
I'm at work.

01:45:00.459 --> 01:45:03.628
No, you know you can't come by.

01:45:03.712 --> 01:45:06.130
I'm pretending to be gay.

01:45:06.255 --> 01:45:11.176
Because in L.A., a straight hairdresser
is an unemployed hairdresser.

01:45:11.301 --> 01:45:13.553
Well, at least
until I get my own place.

01:45:14.679 --> 01:45:17.556
Absolutely.
Okay, I love you too.

01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:20.767
Telly, honey. Would it kill you
to come in there and do some work?

01:45:20.893 --> 01:45:25.063
Oh, I'm sorry. I just had to check
on my honey. You know how they are.
