22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
She knows -- She knows I love her.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
We don't need any of that hippie dippy BS at our house.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
[ Laughter ]

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Sal: They're so dismissive.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Lay down. Lay down.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Q: Roll over.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Roll over.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Murr: Thanks, "Dog Whisperer."

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
We're getting close to the end.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
We'll start this way, and go around.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
How many children do you have?

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Just one. Just one.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
One. One.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Joe, how many children do you have?

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Milana has a younger brother,

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
but I don't let them see each other yet.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
I want it to be a surprise.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
[ Laughter ]

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
How much younger?

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
He's 2.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
"I'm not 100% sure he's mine."

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
I'm not 100% sure he's mine, either.

23:30.000 --> 23:35.000
[ Laughter ]

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Murr: I think Joe's had enough, right?

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Q: I think so.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Joe, why don't you scoop Milana up,

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
and just excuse yourselves?

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
John: Thank you so much for taking the time to do this.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Bye, guys.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
[ Laughter ]

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Bye, guys.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Sal: Dad of the Year coming through.
