00:02.134 --> 00:03.726
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.902 --> 00:06.496
For over a century,
I have lived in secret. Until now.

00:06.672 --> 00:08.640
I know the risk but I have to know her.

00:08.807 --> 00:10.775
Elena. She's a dead ringer
for Katherine.

00:10.976 --> 00:13.911
Is that Damon Salvatore
and Stefan Salvatore?

00:14.146 --> 00:15.340
The original brothers.

00:15.547 --> 00:17.981
1864. You and Katherine
were the perfect couple.

00:18.183 --> 00:19.377
They've come back.

00:19.585 --> 00:21.576
- You get the Gilbert watch?
- I can get it.

00:21.787 --> 00:23.311
- Hey, man, you okay?
- Come here.

00:23.489 --> 00:26.049
Whoa, whoa. I got you. Ah!

00:26.225 --> 00:28.420
- I know you.
- I think you have the wrong person.

00:28.594 --> 00:30.221
You haven't aged a day.

00:30.429 --> 00:34.365
There are things that you don't know,
things that I want to tell you but I can't.

00:34.533 --> 00:37.161
Are you sure the man you knew
was Stefan Salvatore?

00:37.369 --> 00:39.098
- Yes.
- When was this?

00:39.338 --> 00:41.602
1953.

00:45.010 --> 00:48.104
Dear diary, I'm not a believer.

00:48.313 --> 00:52.079
People are born, they grow old,
and then they die.

00:52.251 --> 00:54.549
That's the world we live in.

00:55.087 --> 00:58.022
How can I deny
what's right in front of me?

00:58.190 --> 01:01.591
Someone who never grows old,
never gets hurt.

01:02.628 --> 01:05.324
Someone who changes in ways
that can't be explained.

01:05.964 --> 01:07.454
- Girls bitten.
- Somebody help!

01:07.699 --> 01:10.327
Bodies drained of blood.

02:07.159 --> 02:08.455
You must be Miss Pierce.

02:08.660 --> 02:11.993
Please, call me Katherine.

02:26.945 --> 02:28.173
What are you?

02:30.482 --> 02:32.507
What are you?

02:41.860 --> 02:45.023
- You know.
- No, I don't.

02:45.197 --> 02:48.030
Yes, you do, or you wouldn't be here.

02:48.934 --> 02:51.027
It's not possible.

02:51.537 --> 02:52.561
It can't be.

02:59.711 --> 03:02.043
Everything you know...

03:02.214 --> 03:06.378
...and every belief that you have
is about to change.

03:07.686 --> 03:09.313
Are you ready for that?

03:10.155 --> 03:12.180
What are you?

03:20.566 --> 03:22.090
I'm a vampire.

03:27.906 --> 03:30.340
- I shouldn't have come.
- No.

03:30.876 --> 03:32.104
- Please. Please.
- No.

03:32.344 --> 03:33.606
No.

03:37.516 --> 03:38.574
How did you do that?

03:38.750 --> 03:40.775
- Please don't be afraid of me.
- Let me go.

03:40.986 --> 03:42.510
There's things you have to know.

03:42.688 --> 03:45.486
- Let me go.
- Elena, please.

04:28.600 --> 04:29.726
Elena.

04:36.608 --> 04:39.133
I would never hurt you.

04:39.811 --> 04:42.075
You're safe with me.

04:44.116 --> 04:46.778
All those animal attacks,
those people who died?

04:46.952 --> 04:48.419
No. That was Damon.

04:48.620 --> 04:49.814
- Damon?
- Yes.

04:49.988 --> 04:51.250
I don't drink human blood.

04:51.423 --> 04:53.914
That's not how I choose to survive,
but Damon does.

04:54.092 --> 04:57.152
I'll explain everything to you,
but I beg you, Elena...

04:57.362 --> 04:59.057
...do not tell anybody.

04:59.264 --> 05:00.356
How can you ask me that?

05:00.532 --> 05:04.628
Because you knowing this is dangerous
for so many reasons.

05:05.570 --> 05:09.097
You can hate me,
but I need you to trust me.

05:10.776 --> 05:12.539
Just go.

05:12.711 --> 05:15.077
Just go, please? Go.

05:15.580 --> 05:18.845
If you mean me no harm,
then you'll go.

05:24.723 --> 05:26.452
I never wanted this.

06:39.898 --> 06:42.594
- Hello.
- I want my ring.

06:43.068 --> 06:44.968
- Where are you?
- I'm at the Sizzler.

06:45.971 --> 06:47.404
I had the buffet.

06:47.572 --> 06:50.803
- Where's my ring?
- I don't have it. What have you done?

06:51.042 --> 06:53.135
No, what have you done?

06:53.311 --> 06:57.077
You locked me in the basement
and starved me, so whatever I've done...

06:57.249 --> 06:59.080
...whoever I've sucked dry, is on you.

06:59.284 --> 07:01.980
How many animal attacks
is this town gonna believe, huh?

07:02.187 --> 07:03.916
I know how to cover my tracks.

07:04.122 --> 07:06.488
- Where's my ring?
- I gave it to Zach to hide.

07:07.959 --> 07:09.620
Probably shouldn't have killed him.

07:12.230 --> 07:14.698
Ah, you almost got me. Where is it?

07:16.334 --> 07:20.065
- I'll get it back, but I need time.
- What, did you FedEx it to Rome?

07:20.238 --> 07:23.332
I want my ring, Stefan,
or my next stop's Elena's.

07:23.575 --> 07:26.135
I already want you dead.
Don't give me another reason.

07:26.311 --> 07:28.745
- Don't give me a reason to rip you apart.
- Yeah?

07:28.914 --> 07:31.474
Is that before or after
you get your ring back?

07:31.650 --> 07:33.140
Just get it.

07:58.143 --> 08:00.873
You just don't wanna die, do you?

09:07.546 --> 09:11.038
You said you would explain everything.
That's why I asked you to meet me.

09:11.249 --> 09:13.513
You Google "vampire,"
you get a world of fiction.

09:13.718 --> 09:16.050
- What's reality?
- I can tell you whatever you want.

09:16.221 --> 09:18.189
- I know you eat garlic.
- Yes.

09:18.390 --> 09:21.086
And, somehow,
sunlight's not an issue?

09:21.259 --> 09:22.851
Hi. Here are your drinks.

09:24.462 --> 09:26.930
- Thank you.
- We have rings that protect us.

09:27.132 --> 09:28.724
- Crucifixes?
- Decorative.

09:28.934 --> 09:30.731
- Holy water?
- Drinkable.

09:30.936 --> 09:32.198
- Mirrors?
- Myth.

09:32.404 --> 09:35.430
- You said you don't kill to survive.
- Animal blood keeps me alive.

09:35.607 --> 09:39.600
- I'm not as strong as Damon.
- You let him get involved with Caroline?

09:39.778 --> 09:42.747
Forcing Damon not to do something
is much more dangerous.

09:42.948 --> 09:45.542
- He was hurting her.
- He was feeding on her.

09:45.717 --> 09:49.813
He was able to take away her memories
of being bitten using a mind compulsion.

09:49.988 --> 09:51.956
She never knew what
was happening to her.

09:52.123 --> 09:54.785
- Lf he wanted to kill her, he would.
- That make it okay?

09:54.960 --> 09:56.723
No. No, none of this is okay, Elena.

09:57.395 --> 09:59.090
I know that.

10:04.135 --> 10:06.968
Are there any others,
aside from you and Damon?

10:07.138 --> 10:08.765
Not in Mystic Falls, not anymore.

10:09.874 --> 10:10.898
Not anymore?

10:12.410 --> 10:17.780
There was a time when this town
was very much aware of vampires...

10:17.949 --> 10:19.814
...and it didn't end well for anybody.

10:20.018 --> 10:23.181
That's why it's important
that you don't tell anyone.

10:24.155 --> 10:25.918
I can't promise that.

10:27.926 --> 10:31.521
Elena, give me today.

10:32.397 --> 10:35.025
I will answer any questions
that you have...

10:35.200 --> 10:37.691
...and when it's over,
you can decide for yourself...

10:37.902 --> 10:40.632
...what you wanna do
with what you know.

10:40.805 --> 10:42.204
It'll be your choice.

10:50.815 --> 10:53.375
Never smelled one this bad before.

10:53.551 --> 10:56.019
- It tried to cover its tracks.
- Are you sure?

10:56.821 --> 11:00.985
You only burn a corpse to hide cause
of death. And there are no shell casings.

11:01.192 --> 11:02.216
We know who they are?

11:02.427 --> 11:04.486
Doc will have to check
their dental records.

11:05.797 --> 11:08.027
What story should I run?

11:08.199 --> 11:10.565
Drug deal gone bad.

11:10.735 --> 11:12.168
It's not too big a stretch.

11:13.972 --> 11:15.166
I got the Gilbert watch.

11:16.374 --> 11:17.568
Good.

11:17.809 --> 11:20.869
Found this in the brush
about 10 yards away.

11:27.719 --> 11:30.517
- Vicki Donovan.
- You know her?

11:31.089 --> 11:33.455
I went to high school with her mother.

11:34.259 --> 11:36.557
You think she's one of these?

11:37.228 --> 11:39.458
I hope not.

11:42.267 --> 11:45.395
Where are you, Stefan?
I'm trapped at the house.

11:45.603 --> 11:48.094
And I'm getting really bored
and really impatient...

11:48.273 --> 11:51.265
...and I don't do bored and impatient.

11:51.509 --> 11:53.477
Bring me my ring.

11:56.014 --> 11:57.743
Damn it.

11:57.916 --> 11:59.611
Oh, don't get blood on the couch.

12:00.118 --> 12:01.779
Please?

12:15.800 --> 12:17.700
I got you good, didn't I?

12:21.039 --> 12:23.599
Well, you're not gonna be
any fun today.

12:29.514 --> 12:31.505
I'm so gonna regret this.

12:35.286 --> 12:37.083
Okay.

12:37.288 --> 12:40.257
Okay. Drink up.

12:41.526 --> 12:43.289
Drink it up.

12:44.796 --> 12:47.264
Don't drip. There you go. Good girl.

12:48.633 --> 12:50.396
That's it.

12:54.038 --> 12:55.596
Stop here.

13:06.484 --> 13:08.543
What are we doing here?

13:09.287 --> 13:11.448
I wanna show you something.

13:12.357 --> 13:13.824
In the middle of nowhere?

13:15.660 --> 13:19.118
This didn't used to be nowhere.

13:22.333 --> 13:23.800
Used to be my home.

13:40.819 --> 13:42.309
It looks so...

13:42.854 --> 13:45.846
Old? It's because they are.

13:47.826 --> 13:50.158
Wait. How long have you?

13:52.964 --> 13:55.524
I've been 17 years old...

13:56.134 --> 13:57.863
...since 1864.

14:01.973 --> 14:03.463
Oh, my God.

14:03.675 --> 14:05.643
You said you wanted to know.

14:06.377 --> 14:08.368
I'm not gonna hold anything back.

14:15.386 --> 14:19.550
Half-century before the boarding house
was even built...

14:19.757 --> 14:21.725
...this was my family's home.

14:23.361 --> 14:25.261
Damon and I...

14:26.164 --> 14:28.359
...we were both born here.

14:28.566 --> 14:32.161
The Salvatore brothers, best friends.

14:32.337 --> 14:35.238
- Ugh!
- Wait. Where did you learn this game?

14:35.406 --> 14:39.672
Camp outside Atlanta. One officer
picked it up at Harvard. Catch.

14:40.411 --> 14:43.869
Wait, wait. What are the rules
What are the rules?

14:44.048 --> 14:45.413
Who needs rules?

14:48.453 --> 14:50.785
Mind if I join you?

14:52.223 --> 14:54.384
Well, you could, uh... You could get hurt.

14:54.559 --> 14:56.789
My brother likes to play rough.

14:57.028 --> 14:59.462
Heh, heh. Somehow, I think
that you play rougher.

15:06.104 --> 15:09.904
Why are you just standing there?
That is a girl who wants to be chased.

15:10.942 --> 15:12.466
If you don't do it, I will.

15:21.119 --> 15:24.782
You knew Katherine in 1864?

15:24.956 --> 15:26.150
Damon made it seem like...

15:26.324 --> 15:31.125
Damon was trying to make you think
that I was still heartbroken.

15:31.329 --> 15:35.095
He saw that I was happy with you
and he wanted to ruin it.

15:35.266 --> 15:40.898
All because you loved the same woman
145 years ago?

15:43.741 --> 15:48.110
She wasn't just any girl.

15:55.653 --> 16:00.283
- Ha! I win. What's my prize
- What would you like it to be?

16:01.759 --> 16:03.283
They extended your leave?

16:03.461 --> 16:06.760
I was simply having too much fun
to return to battle.

16:06.965 --> 16:10.093
Your commitment
to the Confederacy is inspiring.

16:10.835 --> 16:12.803
Well, this works out
wonderfully for me.

16:12.971 --> 16:14.302
How's that, Miss Katherine?

16:14.505 --> 16:16.973
Now I'll have both of you
to keep me entertained.

16:17.175 --> 16:20.542
First, I'll need someone to escort me
to the Founder's Ball.

16:20.778 --> 16:23.042
- I would be honored.
- With pleasure.

16:25.683 --> 16:30.814
The smart and kind Salvatore brothers
both coming to my rescue.

16:32.156 --> 16:34.624
How will I ever choose?

16:39.297 --> 16:40.889
She chose me.

16:41.132 --> 16:45.501
I escorted her to the ball
at the original Lockwood mansion.

16:46.804 --> 16:48.271
The first Founder's Party.

16:50.308 --> 16:52.071
Where you signed the registry.

16:56.347 --> 17:01.046
I didn't care that I had gotten something
that my brother wanted.

17:01.285 --> 17:03.810
I didn't even care if it hurt him.

17:04.021 --> 17:07.320
I only knew that I wanted her.

17:09.493 --> 17:11.394
So he was upset.

17:13.431 --> 17:15.092
That's the thing about Damon.

17:16.534 --> 17:18.058
He doesn't get mad.

17:20.204 --> 17:22.001
He just gets even.

17:23.207 --> 17:27.540
Man, that shower was so great.

17:35.420 --> 17:37.081
What did you give me?

17:37.255 --> 17:39.883
Some blood. You loved it.

17:40.058 --> 17:41.787
I did?

17:41.959 --> 17:45.224
Wait, I'm confused.
How did we get here?

17:47.198 --> 17:49.928
We met in the woods.
You were drunk. I attacked you.

17:50.101 --> 17:53.628
I killed all your friends, brought you here.
Gave you blood. You loved it.

17:53.871 --> 17:56.840
And now we're gonna party
till the sun goes down.

17:58.142 --> 18:00.975
Okay. But first, can I have another hit?

18:02.246 --> 18:04.214
That blood was so good.

18:04.415 --> 18:05.575
Only if I can.

18:14.725 --> 18:18.456
What Damon wants,
Damon usually gets.

18:18.663 --> 18:23.066
Now, I didn't know it at the time,
but turns out that night...

18:25.436 --> 18:27.131
...Katherine was with him too.

18:27.371 --> 18:31.102
So he stole her from you,
not the other way around?

18:32.877 --> 18:37.007
Turns out she wasn't ours to steal.

18:53.598 --> 18:55.327
Stefan.

18:56.801 --> 18:58.029
I will love you forever.

18:59.904 --> 19:03.431
Forever is a very long time, you know.

19:03.641 --> 19:04.938
Not long enough.

19:15.019 --> 19:16.008
Ugh!

19:34.872 --> 19:36.134
Good morning.

19:37.141 --> 19:39.006
Leave the room, please.

19:41.479 --> 19:43.344
You're upset.

19:45.583 --> 19:48.677
Your face, it was like a demon.

19:48.886 --> 19:52.219
- But you're not afraid.
- Get away from me. Get away.

19:52.456 --> 19:54.924
It doesn't change the way
you feel about me.

19:55.092 --> 19:57.720
You will not tell anyone.

19:57.962 --> 19:58.986
L...

19:59.163 --> 20:02.223
We will go on exactly as we have.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.492
Yes, we will go on.

20:08.573 --> 20:12.771
You have no idea of the future
I have planned for us, Stefan.

20:12.977 --> 20:15.070
You, me and Damon.

20:17.515 --> 20:19.483
No rules.

20:19.684 --> 20:22.517
She could control my mind
and Damon's.

20:22.687 --> 20:25.747
And she compelled each of us
to keep the secret from the other.

20:25.990 --> 20:29.482
She wanted all of us
to be together, forever.

20:31.996 --> 20:34.260
Didn't work out that way...

20:35.399 --> 20:39.096
...but Damon and I,
looks like we're stuck with each other.

20:40.605 --> 20:42.402
Like it or not.

20:42.573 --> 20:44.734
Is that Damon's ring?

20:45.776 --> 20:48.904
- I took it from him. I have to give it back.
- No.

20:49.080 --> 20:50.638
Don't, Stefan. Keep it hidden.

20:50.815 --> 20:54.114
Elena, if I don't give it to him,
he'll retaliate in the only way...

20:54.285 --> 20:57.049
...that he knows can hurt me.
- And how is that?

20:58.789 --> 21:00.256
By hurting you.

21:05.029 --> 21:06.929
We're working on it, Mayor Lockwood.

21:07.098 --> 21:10.329
- Doc ID the bodies?
- A few townies. Notorious druggies.

21:10.568 --> 21:15.232
I suppose that will make it easy
for people to buy this story.

21:15.840 --> 21:18.308
- And Vicki Donovan?
- She's not one of the deceased.

21:18.476 --> 21:20.842
- Where the hell is she?
- I wish I knew.

21:21.045 --> 21:22.171
Sorry I'm late.

21:23.281 --> 21:25.010
You have the watch?

21:55.446 --> 21:56.538
- It's ready.
- That's it?

21:56.714 --> 21:58.944
Yes. That's it.

22:10.895 --> 22:13.523
I am so over Tyler. So over him.

22:13.698 --> 22:16.690
I knew from the beginning
I was only a piece of ass to him...

22:16.867 --> 22:20.030
...but I thought if he got to know me
he might see something more.

22:20.471 --> 22:21.597
But no.

22:21.806 --> 22:25.401
Jeremy, on the other hand,
that's all he's ever seen in me is more...

22:25.609 --> 22:27.304
...and I like that.

22:27.511 --> 22:29.342
Jeremy, huh?

22:29.880 --> 22:31.711
- Elena's brother?
- Yeah.

22:32.483 --> 22:35.680
So Elena used to date my brother,
and they were always together...

22:35.853 --> 22:39.289
...so Jeremy would always be
hanging around and crushing on me and...

22:39.457 --> 22:42.984
Hey, why don't you have a girlfriend?
You're cool and so hot.

22:43.194 --> 22:45.890
- I know.
- Don't you wanna be in love?

22:46.130 --> 22:47.256
I've been in love.

22:47.431 --> 22:50.628
It's painful and pointless
and overrated.

22:51.335 --> 22:53.394
Except when it isn't.

22:53.637 --> 22:56.663
No more talking. Let's dance.

24:03.841 --> 24:07.072
My mom spends most of her time
in Virginia Beach with Pete.

24:07.812 --> 24:09.609
He drives trucks.

24:09.814 --> 24:12.180
I don't remember my dad,
but from what I gather...

24:12.349 --> 24:14.078
...he's not worth remembering.

24:14.285 --> 24:17.311
- Your life is so pathetic.
- Yeah?

24:17.488 --> 24:20.286
I mean, I'm the screwed-up one.
Matt's got it so easy.

24:20.458 --> 24:21.857
He's the golden boy.

24:22.092 --> 24:25.459
I mean, he's gonna get
a football scholarship and marry Elena...

24:25.629 --> 24:28.792
...and have a lawn mower
and some babies...

24:28.999 --> 24:33.231
...and when I think of my future,
I just come up blank.

24:34.104 --> 24:35.594
You are so damaged.

24:36.106 --> 24:37.130
Yep.

24:37.341 --> 24:40.640
I mean, you don't have one hint
of self-esteem.

24:41.479 --> 24:43.606
Nope, none.

24:47.751 --> 24:51.619
- I think I know what can help you.
- What's that?

24:56.126 --> 24:57.150
Death.

25:35.099 --> 25:38.500
What happened?
We were dancing and then...

25:38.702 --> 25:41.364
- Then I killed you.
- What?

25:41.572 --> 25:44.234
- You're dead.
- I'm dead.

25:44.441 --> 25:47.672
Let's not make a big deal out of it.
You drank my blood. I killed you.

25:47.845 --> 25:50.746
Now you have to feed in order
to complete the process.

25:51.315 --> 25:54.011
You're wasted. Ugh.

25:54.184 --> 25:56.846
You don't wanna be out there
all alone.

25:57.688 --> 26:00.122
You're about to get really freaky.

26:01.358 --> 26:03.519
Look, I had a good time.
I just wanna go home.

26:03.694 --> 26:07.630
You're gonna start craving blood. Until
you get it, you're gonna feel out of it.

26:07.865 --> 26:10.197
Come on, move.

26:10.935 --> 26:13.836
- See, you're starting to fall apart.
- I'm going home now.

26:14.038 --> 26:16.836
Okay, fine. I'm just warning you.

26:17.474 --> 26:19.874
Actually, you know what?
You should go.

26:20.377 --> 26:24.711
In fact, if I were you, I would stop by
your boyfriend Jeremy's house.

26:25.215 --> 26:28.082
- Yeah, whatever. Bye.
- Tell Elena I said "hi."

26:28.252 --> 26:30.584
And if you see Stefan,
tell him to call me.

26:40.397 --> 26:44.299
I got Stanley on the Moore Street entrance.
The rest of us will cover other points.

26:44.468 --> 26:46.265
Call him or call me if that goes off.

26:46.437 --> 26:49.065
- Don't use the radio. Cell phones only.
- Got it.

26:49.239 --> 26:51.730
You've got eight rounds.
Wood bullets won't kill him.

26:51.909 --> 26:55.572
But it will wound him enough
for you to get close and stake him.

26:55.746 --> 26:57.646
You sure you can handle this?

26:57.881 --> 26:59.473
Of course I can.

27:01.318 --> 27:02.945
You ever staked a vampire before?

27:04.488 --> 27:05.682
Have you?

27:07.091 --> 27:08.319
I'm coming.

27:11.028 --> 27:12.495
- Hey.
- The sun is killing me.

27:12.663 --> 27:14.528
My eyes are on fire.

27:14.698 --> 27:16.495
Where have you been?

27:16.667 --> 27:19.101
It's good. Everything's good.

27:23.707 --> 27:25.937
- Well, did something happen?
- I'm hungry.

27:26.443 --> 27:28.411
What do you got to eat?

27:34.418 --> 27:36.283
You're high?
It's the middle of the day.

27:36.487 --> 27:39.115
Could you just not talk so loud?
My head hurts.

27:39.323 --> 27:41.518
I need quiet.

27:53.971 --> 27:57.372
The mind control you said
Katherine used.

27:58.642 --> 28:01.668
- Do you ever do that to me?
- No.

28:04.748 --> 28:06.875
That necklace...

28:07.384 --> 28:09.318
...it contains an herb called vervain.

28:09.520 --> 28:11.715
It protects you from being compelled.

28:11.889 --> 28:15.484
I wanted to protect you
from Damon's influence.

28:18.262 --> 28:20.696
But I also wanted...

28:21.598 --> 28:22.895
...to protect you from me.

28:26.070 --> 28:29.528
Elena, you should never take
that necklace off.

28:30.207 --> 28:33.734
No matter what happens after today
and no matter how you feel about me...

28:35.779 --> 28:39.044
...you'll know that you were free
to make your own choice.

28:48.992 --> 28:51.984
- Where is she?
- Come this way.

28:54.998 --> 28:57.990
- What's she on?
- I don't know.

29:04.441 --> 29:06.432
Hey, Vick, how you doing?

29:06.610 --> 29:09.875
Not good, Matty. I hurt.

29:10.080 --> 29:11.308
Okay, where does it hurt?

29:11.548 --> 29:13.516
My gums. My jaw hurts.

29:13.717 --> 29:16.049
My gum... There's something
in my gums. It hurts.

29:16.253 --> 29:18.551
- You're okay.
- No, just leave me alone.

29:18.756 --> 29:20.587
Don't be like that. Let's get you home.

29:20.758 --> 29:23.283
- Just turn it off.
- Turn what off?

29:23.460 --> 29:27.294
The talking, the chatter.
Just turn it off.

29:35.139 --> 29:38.302
Three bodies were found dead
in a drug deal gone awry.

29:38.776 --> 29:40.607
The bodies have yet to be identified.

29:40.811 --> 29:43.541
They were discovered
at the old Mystic Falls cemetery...

29:43.747 --> 29:46.443
- That's where we were last night.
- What happened, Vick?

29:46.650 --> 29:51.087
...and are looking for suspects.
They're asking anyone with information...

29:51.288 --> 29:53.153
- I'm calling the cops.
- No, don't.

29:53.357 --> 29:55.257
What happened after I left last night?

29:57.694 --> 29:59.753
- Jer, you okay?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

29:59.963 --> 30:01.157
Damn, Vick.

30:03.433 --> 30:06.834
- What's going on?
- She's really messed up.

30:07.004 --> 30:08.801
Elena, back up.

30:08.972 --> 30:11.440
Vicki, look at me.

30:12.576 --> 30:14.476
Focus.

30:14.678 --> 30:16.305
You're gonna be fine.

30:18.515 --> 30:20.005
Everything's gonna be fine.

30:22.019 --> 30:24.010
Guys, take her up to bed.
Shut the blinds.

30:24.188 --> 30:26.213
She's gonna be okay. Come on.

30:26.390 --> 30:27.687
Come on.

30:33.897 --> 30:35.626
- You know what's wrong?
- Yeah.

30:35.799 --> 30:37.528
What is it?

30:37.968 --> 30:41.199
- She's transitioning.
- Transitioning to what?

30:41.839 --> 30:42.897
A vampire.

30:43.707 --> 30:46.471
- What?
- Damon must have gotten to her.

30:46.643 --> 30:49.407
She's new. She hasn't completed
her transformation yet.

30:49.646 --> 30:50.908
How does she do that?

30:54.751 --> 30:57.117
She has to feed on human blood.

30:58.355 --> 31:00.550
And what if she doesn't?

31:03.126 --> 31:04.753
She'll die.

31:11.835 --> 31:15.532
- She may only have a few hours.
- She's upstairs with them right now.

31:15.706 --> 31:17.367
She doesn't know what's happening.

31:17.541 --> 31:20.203
- When is she gonna know?
- She doesn't remember anything.

31:20.410 --> 31:24.437
A part of her is still human, but slowly,
the deeper she gets into the transition...

31:24.648 --> 31:26.878
...the memories will start
to come back...

31:27.084 --> 31:30.019
...and then she'll know
she has to make the choice.

31:33.290 --> 31:35.258
The same choice you made?

31:46.803 --> 31:49.237
I'm sorry I'm so much trouble.

31:49.439 --> 31:52.704
You just...
You need to sleep it off, okay?

32:30.814 --> 32:32.076
No.

32:38.822 --> 32:40.517
Vick.

32:41.458 --> 32:42.482
Vick.

32:49.933 --> 32:52.333
She was fine
and then she just freaked out.

32:52.502 --> 32:55.437
I'm gonna go look for her.
Call me if you hear anything.

32:56.139 --> 32:59.165
- I can track her.
- Go.

33:43.687 --> 33:45.518
- Yeah?
- I think I got something.

33:45.722 --> 33:49.385
- It's pointing towards the old cemetery.
- I'm headed your way.

33:56.233 --> 33:59.498
- Maybe we should check in with Matt.
- He'll call when he finds her.

33:59.669 --> 34:02.900
- What are we supposed to do?
- We wait. We're supposed to wait.

34:03.106 --> 34:05.301
I don't know what's wrong with her.

34:05.509 --> 34:08.239
She'll be fine. It'll all be fine.

34:21.458 --> 34:24.085
Jeremy, go upstairs.

34:27.630 --> 34:28.962
You're afraid of me.

34:29.466 --> 34:32.094
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and guess.

34:32.268 --> 34:34.203
Stefan finally fessed up.

34:34.404 --> 34:36.065
Stay away from me.

34:36.239 --> 34:39.606
Hey, hey, there's no need to be rude.
I'm just looking for Stefan.

34:39.775 --> 34:43.234
May I come in? Oh, wait,
of course I can. I've been invited.

34:53.623 --> 34:57.150
We can cut to the chase if you want.
I'm not gonna kill you right now.

34:57.327 --> 34:59.090
That wouldn't serve my greater agenda.

35:00.764 --> 35:02.391
So...

35:03.400 --> 35:04.458
...where's Stefan?

35:05.402 --> 35:07.063
He's out looking for Vicki.

35:07.904 --> 35:10.099
Don't look at me
with those judge-y little eyes.

35:10.574 --> 35:12.633
Girl's gonna thank me
for what I did to her.

35:13.176 --> 35:14.734
Did you thank Katherine?

35:23.753 --> 35:25.448
Got the whole life story, huh?

35:26.123 --> 35:28.887
- I got enough.
- Oh, I doubt that.

35:33.597 --> 35:36.088
Tell my brother I'm looking for him.

35:38.401 --> 35:41.632
Oh, tip for later.

35:41.805 --> 35:44.399
Be careful who you invite
in the house.

35:58.655 --> 36:00.179
Vicki?

36:07.030 --> 36:11.296
I'm starting to remember things.
What he is, what he said.

36:11.501 --> 36:16.302
I remember you, the hospital,
the rooftop. It's all coming back.

36:16.506 --> 36:18.303
I'm so sorry.

36:19.843 --> 36:22.539
Damon had no right to do this to you.

36:24.714 --> 36:27.478
He said that I need to feed.

36:28.451 --> 36:30.851
What will happen if I don't?

36:31.988 --> 36:33.319
You will fade quickly...

36:34.824 --> 36:38.225
...and then it'll all just be over.

36:41.598 --> 36:42.895
I'll be dead.

36:51.474 --> 36:53.999
- I don't want this.
- I know, I know.

36:54.177 --> 36:56.907
It will be okay, all right?
You're gonna be okay.

36:57.113 --> 36:58.603
I can help you.

37:02.219 --> 37:03.379
Is it better?

37:04.588 --> 37:07.079
Is it better? Will I be better?

37:16.499 --> 37:17.864
I wanna go home.

37:19.803 --> 37:21.634
Will you take me home?

37:22.405 --> 37:23.929
Please.

37:55.772 --> 37:57.171
No!

37:58.608 --> 38:00.701
Ugh!

38:10.420 --> 38:12.081
It's wood.

38:12.255 --> 38:14.348
They know.

38:15.925 --> 38:18.951
If anyone's gonna kill you,
it's gonna be me.

38:19.562 --> 38:21.189
My ring.

38:28.438 --> 38:29.462
Mm-hm.

38:31.841 --> 38:34.674
No. No, Vicki.

38:40.016 --> 38:41.984
I'm sorry.

38:46.156 --> 38:47.248
Oops.

39:08.678 --> 39:09.804
Oh, God.

39:13.483 --> 39:16.350
The watch. Find the watch.

39:27.330 --> 39:30.993
- You're bleeding.
- No, it's okay, it's okay. I'm okay.

39:35.505 --> 39:36.870
I couldn't stop her.

39:37.073 --> 39:39.041
I tried.

39:39.843 --> 39:41.333
What does that mean?

39:41.945 --> 39:45.176
She fed. And then I lost her.

39:47.183 --> 39:49.583
- Oh, my God.
- I'll take care of it.

39:49.753 --> 39:52.551
I'll find her and I will show her
she can live like I do.

39:52.722 --> 39:55.282
I'll make sure
that she does not hurt anybody, Elena.

39:55.525 --> 39:57.959
What do I tell my brother and Matt?

39:58.194 --> 40:01.891
- We'll come up with a story.
- You mean we'll come up with a lie.

40:06.302 --> 40:09.669
I'm so sorry.

40:12.776 --> 40:15.711
I gave you today just like you asked.

40:18.381 --> 40:22.374
And I understand that you would never
do anything to hurt me...

40:22.585 --> 40:25.918
...and I promise
