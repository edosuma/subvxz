WEBVTT

00:03.275 --> 00:04.344
- Previously
on "Hit the Floor"...

00:04.413 --> 00:05.655
- You can't go back to Miami.

00:05.724 --> 00:06.965
They cancelled your contract

00:07.034 --> 00:08.827
and banned you from the arena.

00:08.896 --> 00:10.586
- Let's go beast.

00:13.103 --> 00:15.034
- The crowd loved your dance.

00:15.103 --> 00:17.344
- Congratulations,
we're stealing it.

00:17.413 --> 00:18.758
I got your number, boo.

00:18.827 --> 00:20.758
Watch me call it.

00:20.827 --> 00:22.586
- I am a walking hot mic.

00:22.655 --> 00:24.655
It's either a fire
you're willing to play with

00:24.724 --> 00:25.689
or it's not.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.448
- Um, this is $20,000.

00:31.517 --> 00:33.068
- I thought you could use it.

00:33.137 --> 00:35.241
- I'm Eve,
Olivia and Chase's daughter.

00:36.931 --> 00:38.206
- I don't work for you.

00:38.275 --> 00:40.586
You are not the coach.
You're not the owner.

00:40.655 --> 00:42.000
You're nothing.

00:42.068 --> 00:44.034
- You want to adopt me?
- Only if you want me to.

00:44.103 --> 00:47.137
I don't care about
Jesse Reade's rights.

00:47.206 --> 00:49.517
You can't lose
if you change the game.

00:49.586 --> 00:52.310
- Jelena's gone.
She, uh, took Miguel.

00:52.379 --> 00:54.551
- What do you mean she took
off? What about the team?

00:54.620 --> 00:56.965
- I'm the new owner
of the Los Angeles Devils.

01:21.862 --> 01:24.758
- Perfect timing.
I can't find my badge.

01:24.827 --> 01:26.793
Derek Roman
saves the day again.

01:26.862 --> 01:28.275
- Again?

01:28.344 --> 01:29.965
- You singlehandedly
won the Devils

01:30.034 --> 01:31.482
their first game of the season.

01:31.551 --> 01:33.448
I don't know what they'd do
without you.

01:33.517 --> 01:34.965
- You heard something
I haven't?

01:35.034 --> 01:36.448
- Not at all.

01:36.517 --> 01:38.344
Although, I couldn't help
but see your face

01:38.413 --> 01:39.827
when you heard
Jude got the team.

01:39.896 --> 01:42.000
Something tells me
you prefer Jelena to him.

01:42.068 --> 01:43.758
- Yeah, I prefer
anybody to him.

01:43.827 --> 01:45.206
Feeling's mutual.

01:46.965 --> 01:48.379
- Does that worry you?

01:48.448 --> 01:51.310
The owner of the team
not being a fan?

01:51.379 --> 01:54.551
- I've got bigger things to
worry about than Jude Kinkade.

02:11.931 --> 02:14.413
Tell me how you did it.

02:14.482 --> 02:15.965
- Where'd I lose you?

02:16.034 --> 02:17.862
- How you got the team.

02:17.931 --> 02:21.551
Jelena just swung by the arena
and said, "Go long"?

02:21.620 --> 02:24.241
- Jelena Howard doesn't
give anything away,

02:24.310 --> 02:27.241
especially not the Devils.

02:27.310 --> 02:28.793
She thought it was
the right choice.

02:28.862 --> 02:31.965
Six sexual favors
to five investors later...

02:34.034 --> 02:36.517
- Baller moves...

02:36.586 --> 02:37.896
both of you.

02:37.965 --> 02:40.172
- I didn't have a choice, Noah.

02:40.241 --> 02:41.689
When someone offers you

02:41.758 --> 02:43.758
the one thing you've wanted
your entire life,

02:43.827 --> 02:45.965
you grab it.

02:46.034 --> 02:47.551
You can quote me on that.

02:47.620 --> 02:49.482
- Oh, don't worry,
I was going to.

02:49.551 --> 02:52.827
- It's like we screwed,
and here's my press release.

02:52.896 --> 02:55.482
- Well, you've definitely
become my favorite source.

02:55.551 --> 02:57.517
I went from boning
a lame old VP

02:57.586 --> 02:59.517
to making love to the owner.

02:59.586 --> 03:01.517
- That wasn't making love.

03:01.586 --> 03:03.000
- Well, not the way you do it.

03:03.068 --> 03:05.206
- Look, I'm sure you have
plenty of sources

03:05.275 --> 03:08.241
in your back pocket, Noah.

03:08.310 --> 03:11.241
- Well, I prefer
your back pocket.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.862
- Someone's star is rising.

03:21.931 --> 03:23.689
Welcome to the neighborhood.

03:23.758 --> 03:26.103
I'ma play my music real loud.

03:29.068 --> 03:31.931
- That must feel good.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.482
- Well, it doesn't feel bad.

03:35.551 --> 03:38.586
- You don't know feeling bad...

03:38.655 --> 03:41.000
Yet.

03:44.482 --> 03:46.241
Kyle, I need your help.

03:46.310 --> 03:48.379
- I need my help.

03:48.448 --> 03:49.896
Devil Girls Gone Wild
at Derek's party

03:49.965 --> 03:51.344
cost me my salary bump,

03:51.413 --> 03:53.310
and before I could plead
my case to Jelena,

03:53.379 --> 03:54.551
she took off.

03:54.620 --> 03:57.241
I got nothing. I hate nothing.

03:58.931 --> 04:00.793
Maybe I could use her Midnight
Run to my advantage.

04:00.862 --> 04:02.931
- Okay, okay, if I could
just focus you over here

04:03.000 --> 04:05.241
for one minute.

04:05.310 --> 04:07.413
So, the Devils have
a promo shoot

04:07.482 --> 04:10.413
that's gonna run
with all the games all season.

04:10.482 --> 04:11.896
But it's the same thing
every year.

04:11.965 --> 04:13.517
Guys shooting baskets.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.758
I thought maybe this year,
we can try something different.

04:15.827 --> 04:17.137
Better.

04:23.034 --> 04:24.275
- It's all Devil Girls.

04:24.344 --> 04:26.620
- If those promos had us
in those outfits

04:26.689 --> 04:31.172
on that set
with my choreography...

04:31.241 --> 04:33.724
- And you front and center.

04:35.206 --> 04:36.862
I'll run it up the flagpole.

04:42.275 --> 04:44.137
- Ready for this Miami game?

04:44.206 --> 04:46.068
- I didn't exactly leave there
in a blaze of glory,

04:46.137 --> 04:48.413
and I'm sure they'll have
something to say about it.

04:48.482 --> 04:50.931
- Bro, two years ago,
Devils-Miami.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.862
You scored 62 of 98.

04:52.931 --> 04:54.551
That's, like,
the highest percentage

04:54.620 --> 04:57.448
of a team's total score
by any player in the league.

04:59.068 --> 05:00.931
Now you got me.

05:14.931 --> 05:17.517
- Hey.
You're not gonna stretch?

05:17.586 --> 05:19.448
- I'm stretching
somewhere else.

05:23.137 --> 05:25.586
- Watch Derek Roman
take on his old team

05:25.655 --> 05:28.896
when Los Angeles hosts Miami,
only on ISN.

05:28.965 --> 05:31.758
- A couple less shots
of him wearing a Miami uniform.

05:31.827 --> 05:34.241
This little matchup
is loaded enough.

05:34.310 --> 05:35.931
- Anything else?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.413
- You're wearing
too much cologne.

05:42.034 --> 05:45.379
- So, this is where
the action happens.

05:45.448 --> 05:47.000
- One of the places.

05:55.896 --> 05:58.103
- This Miami game is
going to be something.

05:58.172 --> 05:59.896
You have your hands full.

05:59.965 --> 06:01.689
So does Jude.

06:01.758 --> 06:03.793
It's gonna be a baptism
by fire for him.

06:03.862 --> 06:06.413
- He can handle it.
- Can he handle Derek?

06:06.482 --> 06:08.172
Seems they have history.

06:08.241 --> 06:10.000
They should both
tread carefully.

06:10.068 --> 06:12.034
- Derek never does
anything carefully.

06:12.103 --> 06:13.379
Jude knows that.

06:13.448 --> 06:14.793
- Jude's never been
in the position

06:14.862 --> 06:16.482
to do anything
about it, though,

06:16.551 --> 06:19.103
and he's Oscar Kinkade's son.

06:19.172 --> 06:20.758
- He'll be fine.

06:20.827 --> 06:23.724
Now, if you'll excuse me,

06:23.793 --> 06:26.965
I have some body spray
I need to choke on.

06:35.413 --> 06:37.862
- Hello.

06:37.931 --> 06:41.620
I need some gas
thrown on a fire,

06:41.689 --> 06:43.724
and I hear you're the guy
that can do it.

06:56.758 --> 06:58.931
- So, in addition
to being a liar,

06:59.000 --> 07:01.275
you're a hoarder too.

07:01.344 --> 07:03.068
- Liar?
What are you talking about?

07:03.137 --> 07:06.379
- Telling London
ISN was covering the dance.

07:06.448 --> 07:10.482
- She had a solo,
and I needed it.

07:10.551 --> 07:12.137
She grabbed
the spotlight first.

07:12.206 --> 07:13.517
- So you grabbed the poster?

07:13.586 --> 07:15.137
- You're gonna lecture me
on hustling?

07:15.206 --> 07:17.758
- I'm gonna lecture you
on using me to do it.

07:17.827 --> 07:18.965
- Hmm.

07:19.034 --> 07:22.068
You know what, Noah?
I'm used to being alone.

07:22.137 --> 07:24.000
I can get used to it again.

07:27.172 --> 07:29.482
- Well...

07:29.551 --> 07:31.482
lots of people can't
be near me either.

07:34.551 --> 07:36.206
- Well, we need to find some,

07:36.275 --> 07:37.827
preferably men.

07:37.896 --> 07:39.862
- We have a man.

07:39.931 --> 07:42.137
Well, sort of.

07:42.206 --> 07:43.448
- Who?

07:43.517 --> 07:45.551
- Jelena kinda sold him
the team.

07:45.620 --> 07:47.344
- You're smashing
the owner of the Devils?

07:47.413 --> 07:49.275
Score!

07:49.344 --> 07:50.586
We can double-date.

07:50.655 --> 07:52.620
He can bring Derek Roman.

07:52.689 --> 07:55.448
- They don't get along.

07:55.517 --> 07:57.137
And you can't double-date

07:57.206 --> 07:59.620
when you're not dating
in the first place.

07:59.689 --> 08:01.793
Jude's too bruised.

08:01.862 --> 08:03.448
- I guess it's just us then.

08:06.586 --> 08:08.344
- Hey, boss.

08:08.413 --> 08:09.827
I just need your John Hancock.

08:09.896 --> 08:11.482
It's for a piece
of the Devil Girls.

08:11.551 --> 08:14.896
Jelena was gonna sign it,
but you know...

08:14.965 --> 08:16.034
Mm.

08:16.103 --> 08:18.241
I love what you've done
with the place.

08:18.310 --> 08:21.103
The personality's just... fine.

08:21.172 --> 08:23.275
- Jelena wouldn't
agree to this.

08:23.344 --> 08:26.620
And neither would I.

08:26.689 --> 08:29.551
- Are you sure?

08:29.620 --> 08:32.413
- Are you sure?

08:32.482 --> 08:35.413
- You know what you need?
A hag.

08:35.482 --> 08:37.413
- I've got one.

08:37.482 --> 08:38.517
Anything else?

08:38.586 --> 08:40.689
- Yeah. Have a look.

08:40.758 --> 08:42.137
Maybe that will turn you on.

08:53.137 --> 08:55.655
Nice spikes.

08:55.724 --> 08:57.241
- Wait till you feel them
on your back.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.241
I can't even imagine

09:00.310 --> 09:02.551
what position we'd have to
be in for that.

09:02.620 --> 09:06.068
- How would you feel
making double?

09:06.137 --> 09:09.034
- What would I have to do?
- Me.

09:11.689 --> 09:15.379
- Why don't we go triple?

09:15.448 --> 09:17.241
- I thought you'd never ask.

09:24.241 --> 09:25.275
- Come on, bring it.

09:27.379 --> 09:29.586
- All right.
- Take it off.

09:41.551 --> 09:43.310
- Eve Vincent.

09:43.379 --> 09:45.344
what can I do for you?

09:45.413 --> 09:46.931
- When it comes to dirt,

09:47.000 --> 09:49.344
I hear you're an artist,
Pierce.

09:49.413 --> 09:52.551
You went from a reporter
to a one-man WikiLeaks.

09:52.620 --> 09:55.275
- Nah. WikiLeaks is nonprofit.

09:55.344 --> 09:56.655
- You worked for my mother.

09:56.724 --> 09:59.517
- She needed some information
on a few people,

09:59.586 --> 10:01.241
and I got it for her.

10:03.448 --> 10:05.310
You mentioned something
about a fire?

10:05.379 --> 10:06.793
- Mm.

10:06.862 --> 10:10.379
The Devils have a game
coming up against Miami.

10:10.448 --> 10:12.724
With the way
Derek Roman left them,

10:12.793 --> 10:15.137
it's already tense.

10:15.206 --> 10:16.793
I want it to explode.

10:16.862 --> 10:18.620
- You work for the league.

10:18.689 --> 10:22.172
- I work for myself.

10:22.241 --> 10:26.310
If Miami heard
Derek was trash-talking,

10:26.379 --> 10:30.620
there would be... fallout.

10:30.689 --> 10:32.034
- What kind of trash talk?

10:32.103 --> 10:35.344
- That his season with them
was their fault.

10:35.413 --> 10:37.413
Management was incompetent.

10:37.482 --> 10:40.482
The team was weak.

10:40.551 --> 10:42.379
Miami's a joke.

10:44.793 --> 10:47.241
- The truth gets me off, Eve,

10:47.310 --> 10:50.068
and I'm limp.

10:50.137 --> 10:51.344
I can help,

10:51.413 --> 10:54.413
but it's gonna take
more than spreading gossip.

10:54.482 --> 10:56.206
If you want an explosion,

10:56.275 --> 10:59.413
I'm gonna have to dig deep
into some real shit.

10:59.482 --> 11:02.103
It's gonna cost him...

11:02.172 --> 11:03.448
and you.

11:03.517 --> 11:07.103
- This team has already
cost me everything.

11:07.172 --> 11:09.517
Money's no object.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.448
The Devils are nothing

11:11.517 --> 11:14.413
without Derek Roman.

11:14.482 --> 11:17.344
I want to make it impossible
for them to keep him.

11:26.896 --> 11:28.793
- Whenever we have a
stressful game back in Boston--

11:28.862 --> 11:31.068
--I'd have the guys
blow off some steam

11:31.137 --> 11:32.413
with a little poker.

11:32.482 --> 11:33.862
- What stress?

11:35.379 --> 11:37.275
Feels like my past is
coming back to haunt me.

11:37.344 --> 11:40.275
- I ran right into mine
after the game.

11:40.344 --> 11:42.000
- Olivia's daughter?

11:42.068 --> 11:44.620
These cards for me or you?

11:44.689 --> 11:45.896
- Man, she thinks
Raquel is the reason

11:45.965 --> 11:47.379
why her mother
isn't here anymore.

11:47.448 --> 11:48.724
- No, Olivia is.

11:48.793 --> 11:49.931
You suffered, man.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.310
Raquel gave you
a second chance.

11:51.379 --> 11:52.896
You took it and ran with it.

11:52.965 --> 11:55.586
The past is the past.

11:55.655 --> 11:57.689
- The past is the past.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.379
- Miami's big.

11:59.448 --> 12:02.275
- You can handle it.

12:02.344 --> 12:05.241
Let's play.

12:09.689 --> 12:11.448
- Chips are at the bar.

12:11.517 --> 12:13.000
- I'll get a table.

12:13.068 --> 12:15.965
- Derek won't respond
to any of my texts.

12:16.034 --> 12:17.724
- "I'm at the Playground.
Come here.

12:17.793 --> 12:21.034
We'll go back to my place."

12:21.103 --> 12:22.758
- It's Noah.

12:22.827 --> 12:25.000
- Is there a trap door
that I'm gonna fall through

12:25.068 --> 12:26.275
when he gets here?
- Look--

12:26.344 --> 12:27.793
- Congratulations, boss man.

12:27.862 --> 12:29.758
- Thanks.
Have you seen Derek?

12:29.827 --> 12:31.275
- He's here with me.

12:31.344 --> 12:33.310
- If he thinks I'm gonna
put up with this...

12:33.379 --> 12:35.724
- We're about to play
some cards.

12:35.793 --> 12:37.413
You should join us.

12:37.482 --> 12:39.586
You know, if Derek and I
can squash what's between us,

12:39.655 --> 12:40.965
so can you.

12:41.034 --> 12:43.000
- I wouldn't mind
doing some squashing.

12:43.068 --> 12:45.241
- You're probably too classy
for poker.

12:45.310 --> 12:47.448
- I am. Deal me in.

12:49.965 --> 12:52.620
- Somebody's thirsty.

12:52.689 --> 12:56.379
- I needed a distraction.

12:56.448 --> 12:58.862
Looks like I found one.

12:58.931 --> 13:01.344
- I'm here with my coach.

13:01.413 --> 13:03.034
Saw your poster.

13:03.103 --> 13:04.586
You didn't need
any rookie advice.

13:04.655 --> 13:06.000
You clearly know
what you're doing.

13:06.068 --> 13:09.310
- You have to grab
opportunities when you can...

13:09.379 --> 13:10.862
Derek Roman.

13:22.413 --> 13:23.379
- Lionel.

13:23.448 --> 13:25.034
- Hi, Jude.

13:25.103 --> 13:26.896
Maybe you got one
of my 15 messages.

13:26.965 --> 13:28.620
- I must've missed them
15 times.

13:28.689 --> 13:31.310
You ready?
- Got us a table.

13:31.379 --> 13:33.862
- Won't these guys
get in the way?

13:33.931 --> 13:35.931
- They're playing too.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.172
Could be a good way
to bury the hatchet.

13:39.241 --> 13:41.827
But maybe it's not such a good
idea to clean out the boss.

13:44.655 --> 13:46.655
- Let's do this.

13:49.896 --> 13:52.000
- So, how'd it go?

13:52.068 --> 13:53.965
- Your idea was a hit.

13:54.034 --> 13:56.517
You just slid a $1/2 million
promo to the Devil Girls,

13:56.586 --> 13:58.586
you sly fox.
- Shut up.

13:58.655 --> 14:00.034
- You're gonna want me to.

14:00.103 --> 14:02.517
They love you, love the idea,

14:02.586 --> 14:06.241
but they're not comfortable
with you front and center.

14:07.448 --> 14:09.551
They want Jamie.

14:09.620 --> 14:11.793
- Who's they?

14:11.862 --> 14:13.137
- Jude.

14:19.931 --> 14:22.931
- You keep extra chips
in your office?

14:23.000 --> 14:25.586
- I keep a lot of things
in my office.

14:25.655 --> 14:26.896
You should stop by sometime.

14:28.793 --> 14:30.517
Wouldn't wanna disturb you,

14:30.586 --> 14:32.000
rubbing lamps and all.

14:32.068 --> 14:33.793
- You think I need the luck?

14:33.862 --> 14:35.862
- You're obviously in need
of something.

14:37.482 --> 14:39.413
- Hold this.

14:39.482 --> 14:41.000
Drop these.

14:41.068 --> 14:42.620
- What's wrong, Derek,
your game a little weak?

14:42.689 --> 14:45.137
- Ooh. Hey, now.

14:46.448 --> 14:48.965
- Ten-high straight.

14:49.034 --> 14:50.620
You got a ringer.

14:50.689 --> 14:51.896
- More like a shark.

14:51.965 --> 14:54.241
- That Devil Girls promo
was my idea.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.517
I should be front and center,
not her.

14:56.586 --> 14:58.862
- I'm gonna be front and center
in a promo?

14:58.931 --> 15:00.586
- No, you're not. I am.

15:00.655 --> 15:02.379
- You're too controversial.

15:02.448 --> 15:05.655
Maybe later, but for right now,
Jamie's the safer choice.

15:05.724 --> 15:07.551
- Everyone deserves a shot.

15:07.620 --> 15:10.206
- What are you doing?

15:10.275 --> 15:12.862
- Buying her way in.

15:12.931 --> 15:14.448
- Let her play for it.

15:14.517 --> 15:17.620
- Derek, you don't
have to do this.

15:17.689 --> 15:20.413
- Fine. I take the shark.

15:20.482 --> 15:23.551
Whichever of you stays in
the game longest takes it.

15:31.655 --> 15:32.758
You ready?

15:32.827 --> 15:34.862
- To win?

15:34.931 --> 15:36.931
Always.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.482
- I left my Black Card
in my other purse.

15:42.068 --> 15:44.517
- So we're playing
strip poker now.

15:46.931 --> 15:48.413
- Let's see what you got.

15:54.034 --> 15:55.551
- Your bet, Shark.

15:55.620 --> 15:57.068
Chips or strip?

16:00.758 --> 16:02.620
- Nothing Derek
hasn't seen before.

16:02.689 --> 16:05.103
- I walked in on her changing
at the pool party, that's all.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.103
- Too bad you don't have
another house to burn down.

16:07.172 --> 16:09.206
It's a good stress reliever
with Miami coming.

16:09.275 --> 16:11.000
- Too bad you don't have
a bodyguard.

16:11.068 --> 16:12.448
You never know
when a beatdown's coming.

16:12.517 --> 16:14.896
- You never know
who a new owner could trade.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.103
I fold.

16:19.172 --> 16:21.172
- You have been folding
all night.

16:21.241 --> 16:23.655
Guess you didn't get
your pop's killer instinct.

16:23.724 --> 16:26.551
- Noah. What a surprise.

16:26.620 --> 16:28.172
Perfect timing.

16:28.241 --> 16:30.000
I lost the last hand,
so you're losing your shirt.

16:30.068 --> 16:31.793
- Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey,
no substitutions.

16:31.862 --> 16:34.413
- It takes a lot more than this
to get my clothes off.

16:34.482 --> 16:36.034
- He works for you.

16:36.103 --> 16:37.724
Isn't that sexual harassment?

16:37.793 --> 16:39.551
- Sue me.
- No problem.

16:39.620 --> 16:41.275
I streaked across a WNBA game

16:41.344 --> 16:44.137
just to see if anyone
would turn their head.

16:44.206 --> 16:47.517
But I wanna produce
my own package on prime time.

16:47.586 --> 16:50.620
Every item I take off,
I get 30 seconds towards it.

16:50.689 --> 16:52.379
- Let's see that package.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.344
- All right,
Noah's in the game.

16:56.413 --> 16:58.413
- All right, come on,
let's play.

16:58.482 --> 17:00.379
- Or not.

17:03.862 --> 17:05.068
Full house.

17:07.103 --> 17:09.379
- Four of a kind.
- Hey...

17:09.448 --> 17:12.034
- Hopefully you'll be
this lucky tomorrow.

17:12.103 --> 17:14.413
- You--how about a side bet?

17:14.482 --> 17:16.034
I outlast you,
and you only talk to me

17:16.103 --> 17:18.448
through German ever again.

17:18.517 --> 17:19.793
- Okay.

17:19.862 --> 17:21.068
And if I win,

17:21.137 --> 17:22.896
you have to text me back
right away,

17:22.965 --> 17:24.758
wherever you are,
whatever you're doing.

17:24.827 --> 17:26.896
- Or we can just cash out

17:26.965 --> 17:29.344
and go our separate ways.

17:29.413 --> 17:31.655
- You better have German
on speed dial.

17:47.482 --> 17:49.310
- Hey, stud.

17:49.379 --> 17:50.724
- Kyle?

17:50.793 --> 17:52.689
- Is this how you're handling
your money troubles?

17:52.758 --> 17:54.482
- What am I doing?

17:54.551 --> 17:56.068
- Half the lonely gals
in Los Angeles County,

17:56.137 --> 17:58.689
from what I've been seeing.

17:58.758 --> 18:00.206
I'm not hurting anyone.

18:00.275 --> 18:01.896
- I'm not so sure,

18:01.965 --> 18:05.620
judging by how the Wendy's girl
just walked out of here.

18:05.689 --> 18:08.620
Listen, I'm the last person
to shame a game,

18:08.689 --> 18:11.965
but this is costing you
more than it's making.

18:12.034 --> 18:14.103
You're dragging on the court.

18:14.172 --> 18:15.586
When you burn the candle
at both ends,

18:15.655 --> 18:17.310
you're gonna wind up
with a belly full of ash.

18:17.379 --> 18:21.827
- I... don't even know
what that means.

18:21.896 --> 18:23.586
I do know
what cash means, though.

18:23.655 --> 18:27.068
- That's a short-term solution
for a long-term problem.

18:27.137 --> 18:28.965
I've turned many a man's
life around,

18:29.034 --> 18:32.241
leaving them far, far better
than the wrecks I found them.

18:32.310 --> 18:33.931
Some might call me a legend.

18:35.931 --> 18:37.172
I could help you.

18:37.241 --> 18:40.793
- I seem to be helping myself.

18:40.862 --> 18:43.206
What are you doing here?

18:43.275 --> 18:45.034
- That is none of
your business.

18:48.241 --> 18:50.172
- He is literally
in my line of sight.

18:50.241 --> 18:51.448
Can Noah go under the table

18:51.517 --> 18:52.965
so I don't have to
look at his junk?

18:53.034 --> 18:54.413
- It's distracting, isn't it?

18:54.482 --> 18:56.068
- Jude doesn't seem to mind.

18:56.137 --> 18:57.413
- Oh, you thought
that was funny?

18:57.482 --> 18:59.068
- No, I didn't.

19:03.241 --> 19:05.068
- So, Noah,

19:05.137 --> 19:06.482
there's this guy
I want to set you up with.

19:06.551 --> 19:10.379
He's... kind of a big deal.

19:10.448 --> 19:11.965
- Yeah?

19:12.034 --> 19:13.931
Well, uh...

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
- I'm sensing some hesitation,

19:16.068 --> 19:17.517
so let's ask the table.

19:17.586 --> 19:19.862
Who here thinks
that I shouldn't set Noah up

19:19.931 --> 19:23.000
with someone smokin'?

19:23.068 --> 19:24.586
- Go for it.
- Hook it up.

19:24.655 --> 19:26.758
- As long as it's away
from my dream.

19:30.137 --> 19:32.586
- Sure. Can he handle all this?

19:32.655 --> 19:35.172
- Okay, whose bet is it?
- I'm up.

19:35.241 --> 19:37.068
- Were you always
this lippy, German?

19:37.137 --> 19:38.724
- I'm drinking milk.

19:40.620 --> 19:43.241
Since side bets
are all the rage,

19:43.310 --> 19:44.965
how about we make
one of our own?

19:45.034 --> 19:47.758
- Oh, you drive a big boy car?

19:47.827 --> 19:49.172
- I'm a big boy.

19:53.310 --> 19:55.448
- I call your bet.

19:57.586 --> 20:00.172
- How about you?
You want to fold again?

20:00.241 --> 20:02.241
- I'm all in.

20:02.310 --> 20:04.827
- Read 'em and weep.

20:04.896 --> 20:07.724
- I'm out.
- Yeah, me too.

20:07.793 --> 20:10.517
But three of a kind
beats two pair.

20:12.689 --> 20:14.931
- Noah, put your clothes on.
You look like a tramp.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.448
- Sure thing, boss.

20:18.827 --> 20:20.034
- Something to say?

20:20.103 --> 20:21.344
Oh, wait, wait, wait--
uh, wait.

20:21.413 --> 20:23.241
Text it to German.
Text it to him.

20:23.310 --> 20:25.379
Make sure you have his digits.

20:25.448 --> 20:27.551
- I don't want to have to
take anyone to the hospital.

20:27.620 --> 20:29.931
- I'd be more worried with him
being between these two

20:30.000 --> 20:32.344
playing for that 500K promo.

20:32.413 --> 20:33.724
Just saying.

20:40.103 --> 20:41.448
- Listen, Jerry,

20:41.517 --> 20:43.827
you're the knock-off
king of Chinatown.

20:43.896 --> 20:45.068
Think of how much you can make

20:45.137 --> 20:48.000
off all this Devil Girl
merchandise.

20:48.068 --> 20:51.000
Thermoses.

20:51.068 --> 20:53.137
Mugs...

20:55.517 --> 20:57.586
Outerwear...

21:00.551 --> 21:03.000
Innerwear.

21:03.068 --> 21:04.724
- Well, now, see, that--

21:04.793 --> 21:06.862
that would sell great
on Hollywood Boulevard.

21:06.931 --> 21:08.000
- Mm-hmm.

21:08.068 --> 21:11.103
Comes with matching panties.

21:11.172 --> 21:12.551
They're so teeny-tiny,

21:12.620 --> 21:14.724
you can't even fit the words
"Devil Girls" on them.

21:14.793 --> 21:17.344
Just a tiny T.

21:17.413 --> 21:18.689
So sad.

21:18.758 --> 21:23.586
- Well, I might have
a separate site for those,

21:23.655 --> 21:25.068
for more...

21:25.137 --> 21:27.482
special treasures.

21:27.551 --> 21:30.000
- Well, the rest of this bag
is full of 'em.

21:31.793 --> 21:34.241
I'd be happy to show you.

21:34.310 --> 21:37.827
Let me show you
my special treasures...

21:37.896 --> 21:39.310
Jerry.

21:42.586 --> 21:45.689
Yes, baby, yes!

21:45.758 --> 21:48.172
Oh, yes, baby, yes!

21:48.241 --> 21:49.793
Give me your Louis Baton.

21:49.862 --> 21:51.275
Brand me with your Pucci.

21:51.344 --> 21:54.034
We're gonna make millions
together! Oh!

21:54.103 --> 21:55.275
- Oh, Kyle!

21:55.344 --> 21:57.000
Kyle!

21:57.068 --> 21:58.275
- I'm out.

21:58.344 --> 21:59.793
I got what I wanted.

21:59.862 --> 22:01.310
- It's down to you and me.

22:01.379 --> 22:03.689
- Good. You know math.

22:03.758 --> 22:06.793
You can help me count the pot.
- Or your tears.

22:09.103 --> 22:10.862
It's called
a Broadway straight,

22:10.931 --> 22:12.068
which fits,

22:12.137 --> 22:14.724
'cause it just got
my name in lights.

22:17.034 --> 22:18.862
- Straight flush...

22:18.931 --> 22:20.689
like your career.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.655
See, real sharks...

22:24.724 --> 22:26.310
don't advertise.

22:40.448 --> 22:43.241
- That was--
- I'm not done.

22:51.034 --> 22:53.275
- Wow.

22:53.344 --> 22:55.586
- Okay.

23:01.068 --> 23:04.655
I'm kind of busy this week
with the, uh, game and all.

23:04.724 --> 23:07.448
- Are you giving me the speech?

23:07.517 --> 23:10.241
I don't get the speech,
I give the speech.

23:10.310 --> 23:12.448
I am too busy for you
this week.

23:12.517 --> 23:13.965
Get out of my car.

23:14.034 --> 23:16.448
- Actually, it's mine now.

23:16.517 --> 23:18.172
- You're still gonna
take my car?

23:18.241 --> 23:21.068
After that?
- It's a Mercedes.

23:33.241 --> 23:35.000
- Forgot something.

23:37.310 --> 23:40.206
I can't seem to stop
losing things tonight.

23:40.275 --> 23:42.344
- Well, you lost,

23:42.413 --> 23:45.689
but... I like the fight
I saw in you.

23:47.172 --> 23:48.758
Where'd you learn that?

23:48.827 --> 23:50.310
- Self-taught.

23:50.379 --> 23:52.448
When your dad takes off,
you learn real quick,

23:52.517 --> 23:54.137
you eat what you kill.

23:54.206 --> 23:56.896
- My dad took off.

23:56.965 --> 23:58.172
- Was he a drug dealer too?

23:58.241 --> 24:00.448
- He was not.

24:00.517 --> 24:02.758
Where's your mom?

24:02.827 --> 24:05.172
- At the ATM.

24:05.241 --> 24:07.034
She was his best customer.

24:09.413 --> 24:11.344
You saw something
in me tonight.

24:11.413 --> 24:14.068
I saw something in you too.

24:14.137 --> 24:15.655
You have a tell.

24:15.724 --> 24:17.482
When you have a bad hand,

24:17.551 --> 24:19.482
you change your grip
on your glass.

24:24.413 --> 24:29.034
- Derek Roman's trash-talking
because he's trash.

24:29.103 --> 24:31.275
He knows he took a shit
all over this team,

24:31.344 --> 24:32.689
cashed that check,

24:32.758 --> 24:34.689
and left us
in the damn gutter.

24:34.758 --> 24:37.551
We're gonna leave him
in the gutter tomorrow.

24:37.620 --> 24:40.413
- Trash talk?
I--I haven't said a word.

24:40.482 --> 24:41.931
- Leave you in the gutter?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.862
- It--it's just talk.

24:44.931 --> 24:46.965
It'll--it'll be fine.

24:59.655 --> 25:01.413
- When Jamie said
she had someone for me,

25:01.482 --> 25:04.344
I didn't think
it was Chris Banks.

25:04.413 --> 25:06.758
You're a movie star.
- I know.

25:06.827 --> 25:08.344
Exciting, right?

25:08.413 --> 25:09.793
She hit on me
at the opening game,

25:09.862 --> 25:11.137
and then I had to
break her heart.

25:11.206 --> 25:12.413
Is she okay?

25:12.482 --> 25:14.862
- Uh... yeah.

25:14.931 --> 25:16.586
- Huh.

25:16.655 --> 25:18.586
- I didn't know you were gay.

25:18.655 --> 25:20.068
- I mean...

25:20.137 --> 25:21.448
what is gay?

25:21.517 --> 25:22.931
- Someone who has sex
with other men.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.931
- Well, I'm not out,

25:25.000 --> 25:26.103
so don't go bragging.

25:26.172 --> 25:27.896
- I'm gonna go brag about you?

25:27.965 --> 25:30.241
- You'll want to...

25:30.310 --> 25:31.620
but I'm a private person.

25:31.689 --> 25:34.068
- I've seen your penis on IMAX.

25:34.137 --> 25:37.137
- The body is
a beautiful thing.

25:37.206 --> 25:40.344
I mean, my body is
a beautiful thing.

25:40.413 --> 25:42.586
You'll see.

25:42.655 --> 25:44.448
Once you sign
the nondisclosure agreement.

25:44.517 --> 25:46.137
- Wait, the what?

25:46.206 --> 25:47.137
- You okay with
meeting in backrooms?

25:50.310 --> 25:52.448
- Uh... Jude.

25:52.517 --> 25:55.379
- Hey.
- Hi.

25:55.448 --> 25:59.000
Uh, I'm on a date here.

25:59.068 --> 26:01.137
You just gonna sit and ruin it?

26:01.206 --> 26:02.379
- A date?

26:02.448 --> 26:05.724
I had--I had no idea.

26:05.793 --> 26:08.793
Are you Chris Banks?
- Gotta go.

26:11.482 --> 26:12.482
- If you wanted to go
on a date,

26:12.551 --> 26:13.896
you could've just asked.

26:13.965 --> 26:15.931
- This is your date, Noah.
I'm just sitting here.

26:18.793 --> 26:23.551
But... while I'm
just sitting here,

26:23.620 --> 26:27.793
no, I wouldn't mind you
not dating anyone else.

26:27.862 --> 26:29.206
- Wow.

26:29.275 --> 26:31.482
You really are a mess.

26:31.551 --> 26:33.551
Does this usually work for you?

26:33.620 --> 26:35.517
- This is usually where
the guy picks up the check

26:35.586 --> 26:38.931
and runs for his life.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.655
- You pick up the check.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.137
I'll have another Americano

26:42.206 --> 26:44.827
and one of those
Rice Krispie square thingies.

26:46.482 --> 26:48.379
Lucky for you, I like messes.

26:53.344 --> 26:54.965
- Okay, girl. Bye.

26:57.448 --> 26:58.896
- Some crowd, huh?

26:58.965 --> 27:01.758
- These Miami fans
are hard to miss.

27:01.827 --> 27:03.448
- Hard to miss
you coming out of

27:03.517 --> 27:05.310
Derek's bedroom at the party.

27:05.379 --> 27:07.103
- Nothing happened.

27:08.655 --> 27:10.965
Not that I would've put up
much of a fight.

27:12.620 --> 27:14.793
- I don't blame you.

27:14.862 --> 27:17.068
The man burns down his house,
he can just buy a couple more

27:17.137 --> 27:20.172
with the change in his couch.

27:20.241 --> 27:22.517
- I don't care about money.

27:24.206 --> 27:26.172
- What do you care about?

27:26.241 --> 27:27.586
- Greatness.

27:27.655 --> 27:29.517
Derek Roman's out there doing.

27:29.586 --> 27:31.379
He's in record books.

27:31.448 --> 27:33.172
Anyone can win the lottery.

27:33.241 --> 27:37.379
It's his name
you're going to remember.

27:37.448 --> 27:39.206
That's sexy.

27:41.586 --> 27:44.379
male announcer:
And now, introducing...

27:44.448 --> 27:47.137
your Los Angeles Devils!

27:47.206 --> 27:48.620
First up, number 26,

27:48.689 --> 27:51.517
rookie guard Pax Lowe!

27:55.344 --> 27:58.068
Number 11...

28:01.448 --> 28:03.482
- I'm not sure if you're aware,

28:03.551 --> 28:06.241
but some of these people
want your blood.

28:06.310 --> 28:08.068
- Yeah, I caught that.

28:13.655 --> 28:15.206
- Give 'em hell.

28:15.275 --> 28:18.896
announcer: Number 22...
Derek Roman!

28:46.448 --> 28:48.620
- Watch the top!

28:56.344 --> 28:58.241
- Look, R.J., I don't know
what you heard.

28:58.310 --> 28:59.482
- I heard enough.

29:03.275 --> 29:05.793
- Pax, where's the cover?
- I'm trying, bro.

29:05.862 --> 29:09.448
- Pax, get your man.
- Here.

29:09.517 --> 29:11.862
Ah, yeah, yeah.

29:11.931 --> 29:13.310
Yeah, you think
you can hold me, huh?

29:13.379 --> 29:14.379
- Show me what you got, son.

29:14.448 --> 29:16.310
- Son? You got no son.

29:16.379 --> 29:19.034
- What? What'd you say?
- You heard what I said, boy.

29:19.103 --> 29:20.172
You ain't got no son.

29:20.241 --> 29:21.689
Your two-cent ex-wife
took care of that.

29:50.103 --> 29:51.689
- Derek--Derek,
I had your back, bro.

29:51.758 --> 29:53.206
I was right there.

29:53.275 --> 29:54.896
- I don't need you to have
my back in a fight!

29:54.965 --> 29:58.482
I need someone to have
my back on the court!

29:58.551 --> 30:00.517
I can't do it all.

30:00.586 --> 30:02.482
Stop idolizing me, man.

30:02.551 --> 30:04.034
I am not your brother.

30:04.103 --> 30:05.793
You wanna spit my stats
to me all the damn time,

30:05.862 --> 30:07.000
how about I spit yours?

30:07.068 --> 30:09.448
You played four years
in college.

30:09.517 --> 30:10.896
That tells me
you're not a risk taker.

30:10.965 --> 30:13.206
You spent the fewest minutes
on the bench per game

30:13.275 --> 30:14.448
in the whole Eastern division.

30:14.517 --> 30:16.137
That tells me
your game is your legs,

30:16.206 --> 30:18.724
your endurance.

30:18.793 --> 30:21.275
Look, I don't know
what is going on with you,

30:21.344 --> 30:23.517
but you are useless out there.

30:23.586 --> 30:25.689
Play the game or get out of it.

30:43.620 --> 30:46.241
- My first game as owner,

30:46.310 --> 30:49.620
and I'm giving six different
interviews on live TV,

30:49.689 --> 30:51.896
explaining why my coach
has a concussion

30:51.965 --> 30:53.620
and my captain was ejected.

30:53.689 --> 30:55.172
What the hell are you doing?

30:55.241 --> 30:59.620
- You are in some back office,
and I'm on the damn court!

30:59.689 --> 31:02.413
I am in charge. I'm the boss.

31:02.482 --> 31:04.448
You don't like it, trade me!

31:18.586 --> 31:20.103
- Okay, girls,

31:20.172 --> 31:22.448
let's show 'em
what a half-a-mil buys,

31:22.517 --> 31:24.517
and I'm talking about ass.

31:24.586 --> 31:26.896
- This is at least 200 Gs
right here.

31:28.206 --> 31:29.931
- Okay, ladies,
I worked hard on this,

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
and it's gonna air all season,

31:32.068 --> 31:34.344
so I need y'all to give me
everything and some change.

31:34.413 --> 31:35.758
- Oh, don't worry.

31:35.827 --> 31:37.827
I'ma give better than anyone.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.310
- Okay, well,
let's hope the cameras

31:39.379 --> 31:40.724
can find you in the back.

32:11.241 --> 32:13.137
a glass of water

33:54.862 --> 33:58.000
- What?

33:58.068 --> 34:01.068
Really? Three to five years?

34:01.137 --> 34:04.827
Jerry, we were supposed to
make millions together.

34:04.896 --> 34:06.724
How much Devil Girl merchandise
can you make

34:06.793 --> 34:09.620
between making license plates?

34:09.689 --> 34:12.448
That was a real question.

34:12.517 --> 34:14.448
Hello?

34:14.517 --> 34:17.137
- Who hangs up on a legend?

34:18.689 --> 34:20.758
- His time ran out,
and so did mine.

34:20.827 --> 34:22.448
- I hope not,

34:22.517 --> 34:25.206
'cause...

34:25.275 --> 34:26.896
I need you.

34:26.965 --> 34:29.482
All right, you're right,
I'm screwing up on the court.

34:29.551 --> 34:31.793
I got shredded by Derek for it.

34:34.724 --> 34:36.586
I can't keep letting him down.

34:39.275 --> 34:40.448
Help me?

34:42.482 --> 34:43.655
- I'll do it.

34:43.724 --> 34:45.241
I will transform you.

34:45.310 --> 34:46.379
- You're the greatest.

34:46.448 --> 34:48.379
- And you will transform
my bank account.

34:48.448 --> 34:51.241
Managers get 5%.

34:51.310 --> 34:52.758
You want to be great,
or don't you?

34:54.793 --> 34:55.827
- I do.

35:02.655 --> 35:04.620
- I hope you got hazard pay.

35:04.689 --> 35:07.137
- Better. My camera guy fell.

35:07.206 --> 35:09.206
For picking up the camera
myself and keeping us going,

35:09.275 --> 35:12.241
Lionel gave me two extra
minutes on my feature.

35:12.310 --> 35:15.310
- Now you can say
you've covered a war.

35:15.379 --> 35:18.620
- And dated
a People's Choice nominee.

35:18.689 --> 35:21.137
Big week for me.
- How'd that go?

35:22.344 --> 35:23.517
- South.

35:23.586 --> 35:26.034
But all's well that ended well.

35:26.103 --> 35:28.310
That double date
we talked about?

35:28.379 --> 35:30.758
Jude's my plus-one.

35:30.827 --> 35:33.344
- So my plan worked.

35:33.413 --> 35:36.241
We're even
for my lying to London.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.275
- Not totally even.

35:40.344 --> 35:44.758
I'd have to be blind not to see
all that crap in your car.

35:44.827 --> 35:46.620
- What about it?

35:46.689 --> 35:48.655
- Your packed 2007 Honda

35:48.724 --> 35:51.103
that never leaves the arena?

35:51.172 --> 35:54.689
The fact you never leave
the arena?

35:54.758 --> 35:56.413
You're living here.

35:56.482 --> 35:57.827
You're homeless.

36:04.724 --> 36:05.862
- What's that?

36:05.931 --> 36:08.586
- A key to my place.

36:08.655 --> 36:11.000
It's just a couch.

36:11.068 --> 36:13.448
Just temporarily.

36:13.517 --> 36:15.482
Unless you're too proud.

36:23.310 --> 36:24.551
- Hey.

36:26.379 --> 36:28.103
How's your face?

36:28.172 --> 36:30.965
- The damage was done
the day I was born.

36:31.034 --> 36:34.482
- I'm sorry
this happened to you.

36:34.551 --> 36:36.620
- You didn't cause it.

36:36.689 --> 36:38.620
- Well, no.

36:40.068 --> 36:41.931
Let's see it.

36:46.275 --> 36:48.620
Does it hurt?
- Nah.

36:48.689 --> 36:50.379
I'm tough.

36:50.448 --> 36:51.896
- You are.

36:54.793 --> 36:57.862
I'll let you get back to work.

36:57.931 --> 37:00.896
- Yeah. Okay.

37:02.413 --> 37:04.482
- You're wrong about one thing.

37:04.551 --> 37:05.931
- What?

37:07.620 --> 37:09.103
- It's a good face.

37:19.448 --> 37:21.103
- Hello?

37:22.586 --> 37:24.931
- Derek?

37:25.000 --> 37:26.379
- I came to check out
the shoot.

37:26.448 --> 37:28.172
- You wanted to see
what your poker game

37:28.241 --> 37:29.620
buy-in bought you, huh?

37:29.689 --> 37:32.482
- I mean, I--I put you in,
but you won it.

37:37.931 --> 37:39.862
- Looks like they'd hurt,

37:39.931 --> 37:41.517
but they don't.

37:45.965 --> 37:47.793
- That's amazing.

37:47.862 --> 37:49.827
- Tonight was amazing.

37:49.896 --> 37:52.137
For the first time
in a long time,

37:52.206 --> 37:54.482
I feel like myself again.

37:54.551 --> 37:55.862
- Good for you.

37:55.931 --> 37:57.827
I didn't even finish the game.

37:57.896 --> 37:59.310
Not the best night for me.

37:59.379 --> 38:02.310
- Derek, this is
all because of you.

38:02.379 --> 38:04.103
- I know, the--the buy-in.

38:04.172 --> 38:06.034
- No, the whole idea.

38:06.103 --> 38:08.413
From the beginning.

38:08.482 --> 38:12.793
This promo had to
rep the season.

38:12.862 --> 38:14.931
This is what the Devils
are about.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.689
You've taken a beating,

38:16.758 --> 38:19.344
but you keep coming, battling,

38:19.413 --> 38:22.241
rising up, like a phoenix.

38:22.310 --> 38:24.344
I was inspired by you.

39:25.517 --> 39:28.586
- Hell of a first game.

39:31.310 --> 39:35.206
The league's suspending Derek
30 games.

39:37.551 --> 39:40.206
Hard to keep him
under these circumstances.

39:42.448 --> 39:44.000
- Sometimes being
the boss means

39:44.068 --> 39:45.827
protecting your investment.

39:48.931 --> 39:50.862
- You better be careful, Jude.

39:50.931 --> 39:53.310
You never know when the
next brawl's gonna break out

39:53.379 --> 39:56.206
and who's gonna get hurt.

39:56.275 --> 39:57.827
It could be you.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.931
- Next on "Hit the Floor"...
- Derek, that night, us...

40:10.000 --> 40:13.344
I just haven't been able
to stop thinking about it.

40:13.413 --> 40:14.931
- London's everywhere.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.448
- You woke the beast.

40:16.517 --> 40:18.206
- She did.

40:18.275 --> 40:20.689
- I could be your best friend
or your worst enemy.

40:20.758 --> 40:22.034
Choose wisely.

40:22.103 --> 40:23.620
- Thought you might be
staying here.

40:23.689 --> 40:26.137
- I could be.

40:26.206 --> 40:30.344
- Welcome to the Devil Girls'
boat ball, y'all!

40:30.413 --> 40:33.034
- Are you dancing
for charity or Derek?

40:33.103 --> 40:35.068
- I could ask you
the same question.
