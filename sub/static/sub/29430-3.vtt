Well, we needed that branch
to get down!

07:45.674 --> 07:47.633
Good job, Rudy!
I told you to get
a Nebraska licensed arborist.

07:47.634 --> 07:48.884
Well, it cut a branch.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.552
Not the branch
I wanted to cut, but it did.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.930
Hey, Mike.
Mm. I wish you picked up.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.515
Um, I just wanted to tell you

07:54.516 --> 07:55.891
that my appointment's
about to start.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.643
And it has started... now.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.520
So I love you,
and I'll talk to you later.

07:59.521 --> 08:00.521
Bye.

08:01.398 --> 08:02.773
Sorry about that.

08:02.774 --> 08:03.941
Hey, I was wondering.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.693
What are
your professional opinions

08:05.694 --> 08:08.445
just about the health benefits
of that vaginal jade egg?

08:08.446 --> 08:09.738
I read about it on Goop,
and I was just curious ‐‐

08:09.739 --> 08:11.865
Rio, I want to do
a girls' trip your way

08:11.866 --> 08:13.242
and get wild!

08:13.243 --> 08:14.660
You can't be in here.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.328
Oh, I've spent my whole life
birthing cows.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.496
At least she ain't kicking.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.081
Bucksnort day.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.124
The number on my form, Rio...

08:20.125 --> 08:22.042
Yeah?
Is "one."

08:22.043 --> 08:24.586
Oh, dear.
I've been with one man
my entire life ‐‐ Beau Bowman.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.755
All of y'all have had
all these other experiences,

08:26.756 --> 08:28.215
and I've just had one.

08:28.216 --> 08:28.967
One!

08:28.968 --> 08:30.342
Kay. Kay, Kay, Kay.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.302
Y‐You j‐‐
You <i>just</i> split with Beau.

08:32.303 --> 08:34.638
But Beau's probably
up to 100 by now.

08:34.639 --> 08:37.224
No.
No, I found a dating profile
on FarmersOnly.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.017
He left it open on our desktop.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.644
He added 50 acres
to our farm and ‐‐

08:40.645 --> 08:42.020
and six inches to his height.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.397
It says he's 6'8".

08:43.398 --> 08:44.398
That's tall.

08:44.399 --> 08:46.025
I think he's just
acting out of pain.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.818
Well, I'll act out of pain
all night, girl.

08:47.819 --> 08:50.362
What's that stuff that you did
with all those millions of guys?

08:50.363 --> 08:52.781
I want to do all of that.
I got to get my number up, Rio!

08:52.782 --> 08:53.907
Let's start small.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.242
You know, let's not start

08:55.243 --> 08:56.702
with trying to get
this sex number way up.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.120
Let's try to...

08:58.121 --> 08:59.329
start with the flirt number.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.415
My flirt number
is also "one."

09:01.416 --> 09:02.875
What? How?

09:02.876 --> 09:05.002
The only time I ever flirted
was when Beau proposed to me.

09:05.003 --> 09:06.128
I gave him, like, a little wink.

09:06.129 --> 09:07.254
Alright, listen.

09:07.255 --> 09:08.714
If this is
what you want to do...

09:08.715 --> 09:09.798
Yep. I do.
Okay?

09:09.799 --> 09:11.258
I will support you.

09:11.259 --> 09:14.261
And the truth is
I'm a great wing‐woman.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.846
So let's get nasty.

09:15.847 --> 09:16.598
'Cause I will get you...

09:16.599 --> 09:18.557

Can you please stop moving?
It's making it very difficult.
Sorry.

09:34.157 --> 09:36.158
Rudy: I spy with my little eye
something green.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.701
Please don't say "tree."
It's the tree.

09:37.702 --> 09:39.912
You're not allowed
to be the spy guy anymore.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.539
Okay. I spy with my little eye
something <i>brown</i> and green.

09:42.540 --> 09:43.500
Help!

09:43.501 --> 09:44.666
Help!

09:44.667 --> 09:46.460
Who are you calling?

09:46.461 --> 09:48.879
There's gotta be somebody
out there who can rescue us.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.757
<i>I... am... bored.</i>

09:51.758 --> 09:53.592
<i>Anybody doing criminal stuff?</i>

09:53.593 --> 09:55.220
<i>Birds?</i>

09:59.724 --> 10:01.308
Okay.
Change of plans.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.726
Later, haters.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.394
Rio and I are gonna hit the bar.

10:04.395 --> 10:06.605
We're gonna cover ourselves
in raw fish

10:06.606 --> 10:08.107
and, you know, get wild!

10:08.108 --> 10:09.525
And also, can we dance?

10:09.526 --> 10:11.276
You know, it's 2:00 p. m.
On a Wednesday.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.528
Especially
with the sushi of it all.

10:12.529 --> 10:13.779
We're in a landlocked state,
so ‐‐

10:13.780 --> 10:15.115
Girls' trip! Whoo!

10:16.449 --> 10:18.033
Yup.
Let's hit it!

Mike, comma, you're never
gonna believe this,

10:36.511 --> 10:39.471
but we're at a hotel bar,
crashing a convention right now,

10:39.472 --> 10:40.848
exclamation point,
exclamation point,
exclamation point.

10:40.849 --> 10:42.141
Hey, get off your phone.
Sorry.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.600
You said you'd be my wing‐woman.

10:43.601 --> 10:45.227
Yeah. Okay.
Flirting 101.

10:45.228 --> 10:46.520
You're gonna want
to laugh a lot.

10:46.521 --> 10:48.021
You're gonna want
to stretch your body

10:48.022 --> 10:50.149
like a cat
that just woke from a nap.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.775
And you want to re‐apply
your lip quite a bit.

10:51.776 --> 10:52.985
Laugh, cat, lips.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.736
Now, watch this.
Okay.

10:54.737 --> 10:57.239
This is an ancient technique
that I use to attract men.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.533
Hmm?

10:59.951 --> 11:02.661
Whoo!

11:02.662 --> 11:04.413
Man: Oh. Here you go.
Yeah! Hey!

11:04.414 --> 11:06.540
Oh, my gosh!
You guys don't have to do that.

11:06.541 --> 11:08.625
Oh, and drinks?
Come on.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.502
Thank you so much.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.920
Works every time.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.380
That's magic!
I know.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.424
So, you ladies
going bottomless today?

11:15.425 --> 11:16.926
Bottomless margaritas, that is.

11:19.637 --> 11:20.846
May I?

11:20.847 --> 11:22.347
Yeah!

11:22.348 --> 11:23.724
Hi. I'm Kay.

11:23.725 --> 11:25.184
I just woke up from a nap.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.185
Oh.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.188
I'm Cheff.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.065
Like "Jeff," but not.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.985
Okay.
My lips are
so dry and chapped.

11:34.986 --> 11:36.528
Just the way I like them.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.863
So, do you have a car?

11:37.864 --> 11:39.740
The bank got jealous
and took mine.

11:39.741 --> 11:41.074
Who got jealous?

11:41.075 --> 11:43.243
It ‐‐ It ‐‐
My car got repossessed.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.287
So, who's your favorite Avenger?

11:45.288 --> 11:46.788
Oh, dear.
I don't know that show.

11:46.789 --> 11:47.624
Hey, Kay?
Hmm?

11:47.625 --> 11:48.874
Um...

11:48.875 --> 11:49.667
Red flag.

11:49.668 --> 11:51.210
Red flag?

11:51.211 --> 11:52.377
Red flag?

11:52.378 --> 11:53.545
Red Flag is my favorite Avenger.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.005
Cool.

11:55.006 --> 11:57.633
We have a thing
that we were meant to get to.

11:57.634 --> 11:58.634
No!

11:58.635 --> 11:59.760
God, I love that hat.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.596
You're like a ‐‐
a modern‐day newsboy.

12:02.597 --> 12:04.431
You want to try it on, babe?
I don't have lice.

12:04.432 --> 12:05.849
So, if you do get lice,

12:05.850 --> 12:07.810
it definitely came
from somewhere else.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.063
Oh, wow,
that's a surprise ponytail.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.189
Surprise ponytail.

12:12.190 --> 12:13.190
I'll take this.

12:13.191 --> 12:14.567
Looks lice‐free to me.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.194
Hey. Kay. Kay.

12:17.195 --> 12:18.570
Who's your favorite Avenger?

12:18.571 --> 12:20.030
Wonder Woman.

12:20.031 --> 12:21.281
I just have a thing
for strong women.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.282
Red flag.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.076
Alright, I got an idea.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.535
Let's all join hands.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.246
What?
Rudy, up here.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.789
Okay.
We're gonna make
a human rope.

12:28.790 --> 12:29.790
Oh!
Brandon!

12:29.791 --> 12:32.084
Oh, come on!
Anybody but him!

12:32.085 --> 12:33.205
This ‐‐ He's gonna see this.

12:34.545 --> 12:36.338
<i>Hey, what are you guys
doing up there?</i>

12:36.339 --> 12:38.799
<i>Wait, is this some kind
of white people, Kumbaya thing?</i>

12:38.800 --> 12:41.385
Great! We look like idiots
in front of the war hero!

12:41.386 --> 12:42.511
And I'm not even wearing
my cute bathrobe.

12:42.512 --> 12:43.512
What?

12:43.513 --> 12:44.513
Don't worry.

12:44.514 --> 12:46.431
I'll get you down.
Okay.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.641
Alright!
Beau: Whoo‐hoo!

12:47.642 --> 12:49.226
Just climb up the tree,
throw us the rope.

12:49.227 --> 12:50.394
Don't worry. I got you.
The hero's here!

12:50.395 --> 12:52.771
I got you.
Thar she blows!

12:52.772 --> 12:55.023
Ohh! Phew!

12:55.024 --> 12:56.900
Whoa.
I can't do this.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.568
Just shimmy up the tree,
soldier.

12:58.569 --> 12:59.903
Look, I'm sorry, guys.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.947
Wait, no, you're ‐‐
you're a military guy, man.

13:01.948 --> 13:04.199
I‐I've seen pictures of you
jumping out of airplanes.

13:04.200 --> 13:07.577
No, that ‐‐ that's from like
10,000 feet.

13:07.578 --> 13:08.870
This is 10 to 30 feet.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.872
That‐‐ That's my weak spot.
10 to 30.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.708
That's a super‐specific fear.

13:12.709 --> 13:15.669
When I was in the military,
I‐I defused bombs with robots.

13:15.670 --> 13:18.422
And ‐‐ And, sure, does that
impress women at bars?

13:18.423 --> 13:20.591
Absolutely. 100%.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.218
But I'm just an engineering nerd

13:23.219 --> 13:25.470
who's afraid
of intermediate heights.

13:25.471 --> 13:26.722
God.

13:26.723 --> 13:27.931
That's my truth.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.266
Well, look, Brandon,
you're talking

13:29.267 --> 13:31.310
to three grown men
that are stuck in a tree,

13:31.311 --> 13:33.729
so I think we all have stuff
we're embarrassed about.

13:33.730 --> 13:34.730
Yeah.

13:36.024 --> 13:38.608
Last week, I was so desperate,

13:38.609 --> 13:40.861
I created
an online dating profile

13:40.862 --> 13:42.946
just so my wife, Kay,
could see it.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.322
I wanted her to miss me.

13:44.323 --> 13:45.490
Okay?
Oh, wow.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.535
Just afraid I'm gonna be alone.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.495
And every time
I see Rudy's big ol' grin,

13:50.496 --> 13:53.166
it... reminds me
of the big ol' hole in my heart.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.710
Aw, Beau,
I'm sorry that I razzed you.

13:56.711 --> 13:58.503
But I've become hilarious
since dating Constance.

13:58.504 --> 14:01.298
Well, I tried to go to
the gynecologist this morning.

14:01.299 --> 14:02.758
Oh, buddy.
Why?

14:02.759 --> 14:04.217
I guess I just
didn't know what to do

14:04.218 --> 14:06.136
without Rio for nine hours.

14:06.137 --> 14:08.430
And, Brandon, I was so eager
to impress you,

14:08.431 --> 14:11.099
I painted myself out
to be some fitness guru.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.728
Truth is, I haven't been
to the gym since we moved here.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.439
Or for five years before that.

14:17.440 --> 14:18.899
I don't like working out.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.442
I only passed basic training

14:20.443 --> 14:22.277
because I helped my sergeant
hook up his printer.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.403
Genius.

14:23.404 --> 14:25.489
Ain't no shame in being a nerd.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.699
I'm gonna figure out a way
to get you guys down.

14:27.700 --> 14:28.784
I just need ‐‐

14:28.785 --> 14:30.786
I need that chain saw.
I need a bike.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.079
And I need that scrap metal.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.663
Okay.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.373
What do you guys think
of the dating profile name

14:35.374 --> 14:36.666
I gave myself?

14:36.667 --> 14:38.168
Beau‐normous.

14:38.169 --> 14:39.544
False advertising?

14:39.545 --> 14:41.089
How would you know?
Just a hunch.

14:43.257 --> 14:45.717
I didn't know you could live
in a storage unit.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.428
Sure.
If they don't catch you.

14:49.263 --> 14:53.141
How about you and I meet
in the family share bathroom...

14:53.142 --> 14:54.392
Mmm!
In five?

14:54.393 --> 14:55.435
Ooh!

14:55.436 --> 14:56.812
I scoped it out earlier.

14:56.813 --> 14:59.064
It's got a diaper‐changing
station and a dead bolt.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.690
Uh, excuse us, Cheff.

15:00.691 --> 15:05.278
I have to discuss with you
some lady emergency right now.

15:05.279 --> 15:08.198
Yeah. Period talk.
Nice.

15:08.199 --> 15:10.158
Listen, I am sex‐positive, okay?

15:10.159 --> 15:11.618
But do you really want to, like,

15:11.619 --> 15:15.163
go to the family share bathroom
with this guy?

15:15.164 --> 15:17.916
I gotta have more than one, Rio.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.252
I mean, Beau's plowing
every field on FarmersOnly.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.670
I gotta do <i>something.</i>

15:21.671 --> 15:25.298
Like it or not, I'm going into
that bathroom for number two.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.676
I hear how that sounds,
and it's not great.

15:27.677 --> 15:28.802
But I'm doing it.

15:28.803 --> 15:30.178
This guy ‐‐
he's taking a stick of gum

15:30.179 --> 15:33.390
and rubbing it on his neck
for cologne.

15:33.391 --> 15:35.433
I feel like
you're better than this guy.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.686
Oh. That could be Mike.

15:37.687 --> 15:39.563
Hold on a second.
Okay, you know what?

15:39.564 --> 15:41.481
Who are you
to give me advice, okay?

15:41.482 --> 15:43.275
You act like a big,
independent city girl,

15:43.276 --> 15:45.402
but you can't stop
texting your husband.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.237
Kay.
And you don't even know
how to drive.

15:47.238 --> 15:48.446
I mean, make up your mind.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.782
Are you a 13‐year‐old girl
or an 80‐year‐old woman?

15:50.783 --> 15:53.536
I have not heard f‐from
my husband all day, and I...

15:55.079 --> 15:57.247
feel like, respectfully,
I'd like to go check my texts.

15:57.248 --> 15:59.249
And I think that is...
an appropriate thing to do.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.835
I'm gonna check it.

16:01.919 --> 16:03.504
Hey.
Let's hit it.

16:05.756 --> 16:06.841
Okay.

16:08.176 --> 16:09.218
Kay?

16:10.595 --> 16:11.679
Aah!

16:13.014 --> 16:14.681
Mom, for the last time,

16:14.682 --> 16:17.350
please stop sending me
pictures of your moles, comma,

16:17.351 --> 16:19.603
but the last one
does look irregular,

16:19.604 --> 16:20.646
exclamation point.

16:27.445 --> 16:29.529
Kay?

16:29.530 --> 16:31.865
I just ‐‐ I just want
to let you know I'm so sorry.

16:31.866 --> 16:35.328
You know, Mike hadn't texted
in a while, and so I‐I j‐‐

16:37.163 --> 16:38.788
I don't know why I always
have to check in with him,

16:38.789 --> 16:39.873
to be honest with you.

16:39.874 --> 16:41.124
I ‐‐

16:41.125 --> 16:44.127
Ever since we moved to Nebraska,

16:44.128 --> 16:47.255
I‐I think we spend
every waking second together.

16:47.256 --> 16:49.550
So we've sort of become...

16:51.219 --> 16:54.095
we've become really codependent.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.639
I mean, I haven't even
learned to drive yet,

16:55.640 --> 16:58.975
which is just, like,
patently insane.

16:58.976 --> 17:02.854
And who ‐‐ who am I
to give you advice?

17:02.855 --> 17:04.606
I slept with a guy in New York

17:04.607 --> 17:07.567
who was, you know,
living with his mother.

17:07.568 --> 17:09.069
<i>She used to
tuck us in afterward.</i>

17:10.445 --> 17:11.863
<i>There was this other guy
in Jersey.</i>

17:11.864 --> 17:13.198
<i>He was a juggler.</i>

17:13.199 --> 17:14.449
Yes.
<i>And he didn't have</i>
<i>any bed sheets,</i>

17:14.450 --> 17:16.201
<i>so it was just sort of us
and a mattress.</i>

17:16.202 --> 17:17.661
Whe‐‐ Where's the volume?

17:17.662 --> 17:18.869
<i>And the point is,</i>

17:18.871 --> 17:22.290
I have slept
with my fair share of Cheffs.

17:22.290 --> 17:24.876
So... I get it.

17:24.877 --> 17:28.713
And whatever you want to do,
I've got your back.

17:28.714 --> 17:32.384
And I'm gonna be over here
at the bar when you're ready,

17:32.385 --> 17:34.595
with a big bowl of fries for ya.

17:36.097 --> 17:37.847
Kay:
<i>Get me taters instead.</i>

17:37.848 --> 17:39.432
Kay? Where are you?

17:39.433 --> 17:40.517
<i>I couldn't do it.</i>

17:40.518 --> 17:42.269
<i>I was trying to pretend
I liked him,</i>

17:42.270 --> 17:43.728
<i>but he lost me
when he turned around</i>

17:43.729 --> 17:45.939
<i>and his pony
whipped me in the face.</i>

17:45.940 --> 17:48.108
Never date a man
with hair longer with yours.

17:48.109 --> 17:49.193
Oh, you testifying.

17:50.528 --> 17:52.571
Kay!

17:52.572 --> 17:54.573
Hey!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.700
No, no, no. I'm the ‐‐
I'm the one that's sorry.

17:56.701 --> 17:58.326
I was just ‐‐
I was acting crazy.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.036
And I appreciate everything
that you said.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.538
Uh, New York sounds exhausting.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.206
It's so exhausting.

18:03.207 --> 18:04.667
It's an affront to the senses.

18:05.459 --> 18:06.751
Um...

18:06.752 --> 18:08.253
are <i>we</i> good?

18:08.254 --> 18:09.462
I want to make sure that ‐‐

18:09.463 --> 18:10.672
Yeah. Yeah.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.340
I think I just was, like
I don't know,

18:12.341 --> 18:14.384
feeling like I needed
to test the waters.

18:14.385 --> 18:15.760
Sure.
You know,
see what I was missing.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.680
Um, and now I know that
the thing that is <i>not</i> missing

18:18.681 --> 18:20.890
is a guy who wears
maybe a tiny bit of eyeliner?

18:20.891 --> 18:21.933
You're gonna find someone

18:21.934 --> 18:23.226
that you're gonna
up your number with.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.311
You just have to be patient.

18:24.312 --> 18:25.312
Of course.
So patient.

18:25.313 --> 18:26.563
And you got to just not rush it.

18:26.564 --> 18:27.647
I'm sorry. Hello.

18:27.648 --> 18:28.648
Can I kiss you?

18:28.649 --> 18:29.649
Mm‐hmm.

18:30.651 --> 18:31.735
Oh, Kay.

18:31.736 --> 18:32.819
Man: Oh, my...

18:32.820 --> 18:33.821
Great. Thanks.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.658
Number two!
Oh, my God!
I got my number two!

18:39.076 --> 18:40.577
You did it!

18:40.578 --> 18:41.786
It felt so good.
