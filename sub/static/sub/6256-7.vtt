WEBVTT

00:06.203 --> 00:08.237
Wow.

00:08.272 --> 00:10.740
Now that's a slide, huh, Bud?
It's too hot.

00:10.774 --> 00:12.879
I burnt my butt on the way down.
Let's go play

00:12.880 --> 00:14.914
on the merry-go-round then.
Dad'll take a break.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.920
Welcome to the
dad playground.

00:20.954 --> 00:23.389
Excuse me?
Take a look around you.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.726
Huh.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.094
Are we all divorced?

00:28.128 --> 00:30.196
Most, and I think moms
are just too scared

00:30.230 --> 00:32.564
to let their kids play on
the old play equipment.

00:32.598 --> 00:34.100
It's the exact same stuff
that I grew up playing on.

00:34.134 --> 00:36.469
I turned out just fine.
That's the kind of talk

00:36.503 --> 00:38.504
- that got you divorced.
- Daddy?

00:38.539 --> 00:40.306
Dad?
Yeah.

00:40.341 --> 00:41.808
The roundy thing
is stuck.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.378
Yeah, let's figure it out, bud.

00:45.412 --> 00:48.081
Ooh. One of these kids

00:48.115 --> 00:49.482
needs a change.

00:49.516 --> 00:50.817
All right,
step aside.

00:50.851 --> 00:52.418
Dads to the rescue.
Yup.

00:52.453 --> 00:54.454
Wow, she really
is stuck.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.289
Let me give you
a hand. Yeah.

00:56.323 --> 00:57.623
Okay. On three. Ready?

00:57.658 --> 01:00.093
Yeah.
One, two, three.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:12.406 --> 01:15.742
This is not gonna be good
for my divorce settlement.

01:18.045 --> 01:20.246
Okay, so, how long till
Christine can do the dishes,

01:20.280 --> 01:22.315
and I can play
with my toys after breakfast?

01:22.349 --> 01:24.851
Well, if you feel she's ready
for chores, we could start

01:24.885 --> 01:26.586
with a simpler task,
like clearing the table.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.254
Yeah, just have
to pick up

01:28.289 --> 01:30.089
all the broken pieces.
I'll let her be a princess

01:30.124 --> 01:31.891
for a few more years.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.827
The bubbles are pink, jackass!

01:34.862 --> 01:37.497
Did you just hear what she said?

01:37.531 --> 01:39.932
I believe she said,
"The bubbles are pink, jackass."

01:39.967 --> 01:41.968
Bones, Christine said
the word "a-s-s,"

01:42.002 --> 01:44.087
and where I come from,
that's a swear word.

01:44.111 --> 01:44.771
"J-a-c-k-a-s-s."

01:44.772 --> 01:46.172
"Jackass" isn't profanity.

01:46.206 --> 01:47.774
It's another name for a donkey.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.475
No, it's a gateway

01:49.510 --> 01:53.479
swear word, which leads to
other, four-letter swear words.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.715
Well, numerous studies
have shown

01:55.749 --> 01:57.383
that profanity can be
quite beneficial

01:57.418 --> 01:58.785
when used in moderation.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.153
Okay, you're not

02:00.187 --> 02:01.587
seriously arguing

02:01.622 --> 02:03.990
that our four-year-old
should be swearing?

02:04.024 --> 02:05.704
Use of occasional profanity
has been linked

02:05.726 --> 02:07.727
to increased circulation,
elevated endorphins

02:07.761 --> 02:09.362
and an overall
sense of calmness.

02:09.395 --> 02:10.930
No, no.

02:10.965 --> 02:13.366
Don't science-up
the swearing.

02:14.835 --> 02:17.437
We got to talk here,
all right, pumpkin?

02:17.471 --> 02:21.240
Listen, Christine, that
word that you just used,

02:21.275 --> 02:24.477
okay, to call your bunny--
that's a naughty word.

02:24.511 --> 02:26.512
We don't say that
in this house.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.514
Okay?

02:28.549 --> 02:30.817
A body was found on a
playground in Forest Hill

02:30.851 --> 02:32.118
under a merry-go-round.
Well, last time

02:32.152 --> 02:33.586
I checked, people
just don't

02:33.621 --> 02:35.822
crawl under those things
and die on their own.

02:35.856 --> 02:38.057
I have to get ready. The remains
are on their way to the lab.

02:38.092 --> 02:39.459
All right, I'll
take Little Miss, uh,

02:39.493 --> 02:41.194
Potty Mouth to Max's.

02:41.228 --> 02:44.063
Then I'll go to the office then.
Okay.

02:44.098 --> 02:45.598
So,

02:45.633 --> 02:47.400
about the naughty words.

02:47.434 --> 02:48.801
Right? Are we clear?

02:48.836 --> 02:51.137
We don't use them in this house.
Yes.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.772
Okay.
But it's not my fault.

02:52.806 --> 02:55.708
Bunny <i> is</i> a jackass.

02:57.278 --> 02:59.779
The parabolic
dental arch indicates

02:59.813 --> 03:01.281
the victim was Caucasian,

03:01.315 --> 03:03.683
while the lack of subpubic
concavity suggests male.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.885
Age will be a bit more
difficult because...

03:05.920 --> 03:07.487
I got age.

03:07.521 --> 03:11.257
Slightly coarse granularity
of the auricular surfaces

03:11.292 --> 03:12.892
puts him
mid-to-late 20s.

03:12.927 --> 03:14.594
It's a piece of cake.

03:14.628 --> 03:17.063
This is not a competition,
Oliver.

03:17.097 --> 03:18.031
You are delightfully naive.

03:18.065 --> 03:19.799
I am noticing

03:19.833 --> 03:21.901
deep incisions to
the nasal bones,

03:21.936 --> 03:25.572
zygomatic arches
and the maxilla.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.674
Now, what kind of person shoves
a dead body

03:27.708 --> 03:29.542
under a piece
of playground equipment?

03:29.577 --> 03:31.344
A fun-loving person?

03:31.378 --> 03:33.646
- How's it going over there?
- Lots of tissue

03:33.681 --> 03:35.114
dried onto the metal.

03:35.149 --> 03:36.316
It's gonna take a while
to scrape off.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.884
There's also evidence of

03:37.918 --> 03:41.754
rodent predation, so,
separating the damage from

03:41.789 --> 03:44.057
an assailant and the
playground environment

03:44.091 --> 03:46.492
will be a challenge
for you, Dr. Wells.

03:46.527 --> 03:49.162
Challenge accepted.

03:49.196 --> 03:50.763
The degree of brown
discoloration in the tissue

03:50.798 --> 03:52.832
puts time of death
between two and two and a half

03:52.866 --> 03:54.400
days ago.

03:54.435 --> 03:57.370
Cam, as a mother,
how do you feel about swearing?

03:57.404 --> 03:59.472
I try to limit it
to stubbing my toe,

03:59.506 --> 04:00.473
getting caught in traffic...

04:00.507 --> 04:02.442
I meant Michelle.
Oh.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.344
Only when she sings along
to music she likes.

04:04.378 --> 04:05.879
Christine
used the word

04:05.913 --> 04:07.313
"jackass" this morning,

04:07.348 --> 04:10.617
and Booth said
that it was a gateway profanity.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.919
Jackass. How adorable, huh?

04:12.953 --> 04:15.522
I think my first one was
in the ass family, also.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.923
I don't feel that children
should be punished

04:17.958 --> 04:20.360
for expressing themselves
in a non-violent manner.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.894
Damn!

04:21.928 --> 04:23.796
Looks like our victim
was sporting a mouthful

04:23.831 --> 04:25.565
of porcelain veneers.
Oh.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.734
A set of veneers like this
could cost as much as $30,000.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.270
- Meaning our victim had money.
- Not on him,

04:30.304 --> 04:31.804
he didn't.
I wasn't able to find

04:31.839 --> 04:33.806
a wallet or a cell
phone in the victim's

04:33.841 --> 04:35.975
- clothing or effects.
- Lack of melanin

04:36.010 --> 04:37.243
in a band shape

04:37.278 --> 04:39.412
on the flesh
of the left ring finger

04:39.446 --> 04:41.014
suggests the victim was also
missing a wedding band.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.348
Sounds like

04:42.383 --> 04:43.716
he was robbed.
Well, we may

04:43.751 --> 04:45.285
not know who the victim was,

04:45.319 --> 04:46.619
or what killed him,

04:46.654 --> 04:48.888
but it sounds like
we just found motive.

04:50.191 --> 04:52.492
Uh,

04:52.526 --> 04:54.561
um, can someone

04:54.595 --> 04:57.430
please retrieve this piece
of evidence

04:57.464 --> 04:59.833
- so it's not compromised?
- Yeah.

04:59.867 --> 05:02.035
In a second. I just got
to get a picture

05:02.069 --> 05:03.803
of this for the Christmas party.

05:03.838 --> 05:05.572
Seriously?

05:07.241 --> 05:08.541
Smile.

05:08.576 --> 05:11.144

So you think

the victim might have been
killed for his valuables, huh?

05:58.837 --> 06:01.438
I thought you had paperwork to do.
Yeah.

06:01.473 --> 06:03.273
Which no one ever reads.

06:03.308 --> 06:05.742
In pulling those reports,
I noticed a string of robberies

06:05.777 --> 06:08.137
at a hostel less than a mile
from where the body was dumped.

06:08.307 --> 06:11.175
Four in the past month here.
Local PD hasn't had much luck

06:11.210 --> 06:13.244
catching the thieves.
And if the guy was staying

06:13.278 --> 06:15.246
at the hostel, someone might
have seen him there.

06:15.280 --> 06:17.148
My thought exactly.

06:17.182 --> 06:18.716
I'll see if anyone
there recalls seeing

06:18.751 --> 06:20.852
a guy fitting our victim's description.
Oh, ho.

06:20.886 --> 06:22.387
Slow down.
Pump the brakes there.

06:22.421 --> 06:25.323
What, are you assigning
yourself to the case?

06:25.357 --> 06:26.891
I guess so.

06:26.925 --> 06:29.660
Thanks for saving
me from desk duty.

06:29.695 --> 06:32.163
Great. Anything I can do
to help you out, Aubrey.

06:32.197 --> 06:33.998
Would you like anything else?
How about my lunch?

06:34.032 --> 06:35.633
How about...? Would you like

06:35.667 --> 06:37.168
a bite of my sandwich?

06:38.937 --> 06:40.338
Yes.

06:40.372 --> 06:43.941
You're a prince, you know that?

06:50.382 --> 06:51.783
Dr. Brennan, when
you first started,

06:51.817 --> 06:53.651
how many hours
were you pulling?

06:53.685 --> 06:55.019
Before I had

06:55.054 --> 06:56.721
a family, I was in the lab

06:56.755 --> 07:00.024
anywhere from ten to 15 hours
a day, including weekends.

07:00.059 --> 07:01.259
Why do you ask?

07:01.293 --> 07:03.661
Because one day,
I plan on surpassing you

07:03.696 --> 07:06.064
as the world's foremost
forensic anthropologist.

07:06.098 --> 07:08.266
I applaud your ambition,
Dr. Wells,

07:08.300 --> 07:11.002
but being the best
in your field requires more

07:11.036 --> 07:13.271
than the accumulation of hours.

07:13.305 --> 07:17.742
Well, I'm also a genius with
a 160 IQ, so, I think I'm okay.

07:17.776 --> 07:19.544
Perhaps,
but I'd temper yourself.

07:19.578 --> 07:22.680
The likelihood of you being
as good as I am is very remote.

07:22.715 --> 07:24.115
Oh, no.

07:24.149 --> 07:26.851
Not "as good as." Better than.

07:26.885 --> 07:30.421
I believe the expression is,
"Bring it on over," Dr. Wells.

07:30.456 --> 07:33.324
No. The expression
is "Bring it on."

07:33.359 --> 07:36.894
There's no "over." But okay.

07:37.996 --> 07:40.164
Hemorrhagic staining
to the area

07:40.199 --> 07:42.266
surrounding the wound
on the frontal bone

07:42.301 --> 07:44.402
suggests that the injury
was sustained around

07:44.436 --> 07:46.137
time of death.

07:46.171 --> 07:48.172
The staining could have been the
result of a minor head injury

07:48.207 --> 07:49.874
that became exaggerated

07:49.908 --> 07:51.409
during its time
under the merry-go-round.

07:51.443 --> 07:53.978
We can't know for sure
if it's cause of death

07:54.013 --> 07:56.681
until the skull
is reconstructed.

07:56.715 --> 07:58.349
Unfortunately,
that's going to have to wait.

07:58.384 --> 07:59.851
- I need the skull.
- But

07:59.885 --> 08:02.253
we need it to determine cause
of death.

08:02.287 --> 08:04.622
Which isn't gonna do much good
if we don't know who was killed.

08:04.656 --> 08:07.091
Angela said that the skull
was damaged too much

08:07.126 --> 08:08.526
to get a facial
reconstruction.

08:08.560 --> 08:09.794
And I concur.

08:09.828 --> 08:13.331
But I do not.

08:23.509 --> 08:27.679
Cam, you're either a genius, or
a deeply disturbed human being.

08:27.713 --> 08:29.047
Would you mind

08:29.081 --> 08:30.615
passing me the
victim's nose?

08:30.649 --> 08:34.251
It's weird that
that's not a weird question.

08:35.386 --> 08:37.087
Thank you.

08:37.121 --> 08:38.956
Okay.

08:38.991 --> 08:41.626
So, roughly?

08:41.659 --> 08:43.227
Okay.

08:43.261 --> 08:44.696
According to my notes,
the length

08:44.730 --> 08:46.564
of the victim's skull
is ten inches,

08:46.598 --> 08:49.267
which means the tip of the nose
should be placed

08:49.301 --> 08:50.802
a quarter of an inch lower.

08:50.836 --> 08:52.403
Okay.

08:55.274 --> 08:56.741
How's that look?

08:56.775 --> 08:59.544
Like a shredded nose adhering
to the golden ratio.

08:59.578 --> 09:01.512
Cannot believe
we're doing this.

09:01.547 --> 09:03.748
Well, I've always
loved arts and crafts.

09:04.012 --> 09:07.058
Now, all we need to
do is add the ear.

09:07.059 --> 09:07.552
Okay.

09:07.553 --> 09:10.088
And we'll have
ourselves a face.

09:10.122 --> 09:12.991
So, the bottom of the lobe
should be placed parallel

09:13.025 --> 09:15.159
with the tip of the nose.

09:15.194 --> 09:17.028
Okay.

09:17.062 --> 09:18.429
A glue stick?

09:18.464 --> 09:20.965
Hey, forensic lo-Fi.

09:25.437 --> 09:28.072
I think we're ready.

09:32.811 --> 09:36.948
Okay, so, I'll scan the image
into the Angelatron.

09:36.982 --> 09:40.451
I'll fill in the gaps, and

09:40.486 --> 09:42.020
smooth out
the contours.

09:42.054 --> 09:43.921
Add some color
to the flesh

09:43.956 --> 09:46.624
to compensate
for the dehydration.

09:46.659 --> 09:48.459
From Frankenstein

09:48.494 --> 09:50.261
to just plain old Frank.

09:50.296 --> 09:52.063
So, we know the
victim was married.

09:52.097 --> 09:54.432
Hopefully, his wife
reported him missing.

09:59.905 --> 10:01.005
Good call.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.974
"Toby

10:03.008 --> 10:04.375
Wachlin."

10:04.410 --> 10:07.578
Reported missing by
his wife yesterday.

10:07.613 --> 10:09.914
<i> Oh, my God.</i>

10:09.949 --> 10:12.383
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Mrs. Wachlin, we know that

10:12.418 --> 10:14.886
this is a lot to take in,
but if we're going

10:14.920 --> 10:17.155
to catch your husband's killer,
we need your help here.

10:17.189 --> 10:18.556
I don't know how to help.

10:18.591 --> 10:20.325
I-I don't know
how to do anything.

10:20.359 --> 10:22.393
Toby was the one
who took care of everything.

10:22.428 --> 10:24.195
The mortgage, the bills,
the lightbulbs.

10:24.230 --> 10:25.964
I never even changed
a lightbulb.

10:25.998 --> 10:28.499
Okay, I can show you how to do
that later, but right now,

10:28.534 --> 10:30.501
we need to know
if your husband had any enemies,

10:30.536 --> 10:31.970
anyone who'd want to hurt him.

10:32.004 --> 10:33.404
No.

10:33.439 --> 10:35.373
Toby was... sweet, generous.

10:35.407 --> 10:37.108
He tipped well.
People loved him.

10:37.142 --> 10:39.510
That's <i> another</i> thing.

10:39.545 --> 10:42.447
I don't know how much to tip,
or-or even <i> who</i> to tip.

10:42.481 --> 10:44.682
Waiters, I know, but
the front desk guy at a hotel...

10:44.717 --> 10:46.951
Annie, stop pacing.
Just breathe.

10:46.986 --> 10:49.320
That's it.
Have a seat, please.

10:49.355 --> 10:51.856
Just sit down.
Continue breathing.

10:51.891 --> 10:53.558
When was the last time

10:53.592 --> 10:55.760
you saw Toby?
I was down in Miami

10:55.794 --> 10:57.195
with my girlfriends
all week.

10:57.229 --> 10:58.429
But the day before last,

10:58.464 --> 11:00.398
I got a call from Lucia,
our housekeeper.

11:00.432 --> 11:01.633
Lucia said

11:01.667 --> 11:03.434
Toby never came home from work

11:03.469 --> 11:05.503
- the previous night.
- Was that uncommon?

11:05.538 --> 11:07.505
Toby worked
late, sure,

11:07.540 --> 11:11.131
but he'd always come home,
even if it was just for a few hours.

11:11.132 --> 11:13.711
And where was it that
your husband worked?

11:13.746 --> 11:15.947
Toby was a trader
at Horizon Equities.

11:16.882 --> 11:18.049
Great. Okay.

11:18.083 --> 11:20.518
Thank you so much
for coming in.

11:20.553 --> 11:23.521
I think we got everything
that we need right now.

11:23.556 --> 11:25.523
Uh, and if we have
any more questions,

11:25.558 --> 11:27.825
we'll get in touch with you,
okay?

11:27.860 --> 11:29.227
You've been such a help.
Yeah.

11:29.261 --> 11:31.129
Am I supposed
to tip you guys?

11:31.163 --> 11:33.198
No. Th-This way.
We go this way.

11:33.232 --> 11:35.366
No tips.
No tips.

11:35.401 --> 11:37.368
Horizon is the biggest
hedge fund in DC.

11:37.403 --> 11:39.204
They manage over
$4 billion in assets.

11:39.238 --> 11:41.039
When you're dealing
with that kind of money,

11:41.073 --> 11:42.707
there's always
a motive for murder.

11:42.741 --> 11:45.076
That kind of money can turn.

11:45.110 --> 11:46.911
That's for sure.

11:46.946 --> 11:48.780
Hold on. Look, before we
get into this elevator,

11:48.814 --> 11:50.281
I want to make
sure you're okay.

11:50.316 --> 11:52.584
With what? Going to a hedge fund?
You hate

11:52.618 --> 11:54.862
the one percent more than I do,
and that says something.

11:54.886 --> 11:55.820
Aw, come on, Booth,

11:55.821 --> 11:57.388
I want to bring down
the bad guys.

11:57.423 --> 11:59.157
That's what we do, so let's...
I read your file,

11:59.191 --> 12:01.492
and I know what happened to you.
Oh.

12:03.028 --> 12:05.230
Great. Then you know
how important

12:05.264 --> 12:07.232
a case like this is to me.

12:07.266 --> 12:09.000
Right.

12:13.472 --> 12:15.473
Toby was the head
of my high-frequency

12:15.507 --> 12:17.909
trading fund.
Figures you'd have one of those.

12:17.943 --> 12:19.577
What does that mean?
It means

12:19.612 --> 12:21.646
he used computer algorithms
to front-run the market

12:21.680 --> 12:24.649
and cheat the firm's own clients
so you could increase profits.

12:24.683 --> 12:26.518
Isn't that right, Mason?

12:26.552 --> 12:27.619
Not technically
front-running.

12:27.653 --> 12:29.521
Nothing illegal in that.

12:29.555 --> 12:31.556
There isn't?
Legally, these defenders

12:31.590 --> 12:33.324
of capitalism don't
even have to act

12:33.359 --> 12:35.093
in their client's
best interests.

12:44.670 --> 12:48.406
New kid just shorted CDK
to the tune of a million shares.

12:48.440 --> 12:50.775
Excellent. Please...

12:50.809 --> 12:53.912
pass this along as an expression
of my gratitude.

12:53.946 --> 12:55.780
That was a joke, right?
You just tossed him

12:55.815 --> 12:57.649
a lot of money.
Nine or ten thousand,

12:57.683 --> 12:59.684
I'd imagine--
but it's actually

12:59.718 --> 13:01.553
quite small
considering

13:01.587 --> 13:04.522
- he just made me $10 million.
- Okay,

13:04.557 --> 13:07.325
did Toby lose any
of your money recently?

13:07.359 --> 13:09.861
I'll ignore the offensive
implication of that question

13:09.895 --> 13:12.397
and answer anyway. Yes.

13:12.431 --> 13:14.833
Toby, uh,
hit the wrong key

13:14.867 --> 13:17.435
last week and cost
our fund $8 million.

13:17.470 --> 13:18.770
But last year alone,

13:18.804 --> 13:22.373
he made the firm
over half a billion dollars.

13:22.408 --> 13:26.244
Me killing him over a few measly
million would be bad business,

13:26.278 --> 13:28.012
and I don't do bad business.

13:28.047 --> 13:29.948
Right. Well, I'm
gonna need a list

13:29.982 --> 13:33.151
of all the employees who lost
money because of Toby's mistake.

13:33.185 --> 13:34.853
Of course.
You can start

13:34.887 --> 13:37.355
with the beast
in the purple tie, Blair Ellis.

13:37.389 --> 13:38.756
Poor guy's been
struggling lately.

13:38.791 --> 13:40.758
He got hit hard
because of Toby's mistake.

13:40.793 --> 13:42.260
But Blair's
a good person.

13:42.294 --> 13:44.696
The only thing he wants
to kill is the market.

13:53.054 --> 13:55.281
<i> So, three days ago,</i>
<i>Toby hit the wrong button</i>

13:55.282 --> 13:57.482
on a computer-- a mistake
that cost you, what, $500,000?

13:58.740 --> 14:01.607
And that same night
he gets murdered <i> and</i> robbed.

14:01.643 --> 14:03.576
Right, so I'm figuring
Toby robs you,

14:03.611 --> 14:05.711
you rob Toby--
it's eye for an eye.

14:05.747 --> 14:07.747
When you're on a team,
you don't kill

14:07.782 --> 14:10.149
the quarterback
just because he had a bad day.

14:10.185 --> 14:12.919
Sure, you know,
I got a little pissed.

14:12.954 --> 14:14.420
But I'm all about the team.

14:14.456 --> 14:17.166
And the Horizon team
is worse off because Toby's gone.

14:17.167 --> 14:20.026
Yeah, but Toby wasn't
really on the same team,

14:20.061 --> 14:21.427
was he, Blair?

14:21.463 --> 14:23.529
What do you mean?
Yeah, what do you mean?

14:23.565 --> 14:25.431
You old-school brokers
hate high-frequency traders

14:25.467 --> 14:27.667
like Toby-- you think
they're gaming the system,

14:27.702 --> 14:31.170
making a mint,
and locking you out.

14:32.574 --> 14:35.441
We all have
different positions to play.

14:35.477 --> 14:37.543
See, that's...
that's how a team works.

14:37.579 --> 14:40.279
Right. We know all about
your team philosophy.

14:40.315 --> 14:42.448
Right? As the quarterback for
the Spartans, you led them

14:42.484 --> 14:45.051
to a national championship
your junior year.

14:45.086 --> 14:48.054
Sort of backs up my position,
doesn't it?

14:48.089 --> 14:49.822
Look, I would
never hurt

14:49.858 --> 14:51.791
a teammate--
you could ask any of the guys

14:51.826 --> 14:53.493
I played with.
Yeah, but that temper

14:53.528 --> 14:55.461
of yours ended up
getting you suspended

14:55.497 --> 14:58.731
the following year for, uh,
punching out a ref, right?

14:58.766 --> 15:00.700
Yeah. In the heat of the game.

15:00.735 --> 15:02.702
You know, this...
this is all crap.

15:03.605 --> 15:06.639
Utter crap.

15:09.511 --> 15:12.145
Dr. Wells,
what can I do for you?

15:12.180 --> 15:13.846
Seriously?

15:14.749 --> 15:15.848
Oh. Sorry.

15:15.884 --> 15:18.584
I just... saw
the curly hair, beard,

15:18.620 --> 15:20.486
lab coat.
Both brilliant, of course.

15:20.522 --> 15:21.921
Me a little more so.

15:21.956 --> 15:24.524
Here's an example of
why-- I just finished

15:24.559 --> 15:26.999
combing through the victim's clothing
for particulates, right?

15:27.028 --> 15:30.029
Well, most of what I found
was silica play sand,

15:30.064 --> 15:31.430
Zoysia grass and rust.

15:31.466 --> 15:33.132
All stuff you find
in a playground.

15:33.168 --> 15:36.702
Yep.<i> But</i> none of it was in
the treads of his shoes.

15:36.738 --> 15:38.538
Which means he was killed
someplace else.

15:38.573 --> 15:41.007
Are you gonna give me
bad or good news next?

15:41.042 --> 15:42.508
Well, I also
found traces

15:42.544 --> 15:45.645
of sulfuryl fluoride,
also known as Vikane,

15:45.680 --> 15:47.513
Zythor or Master Fume.

15:47.549 --> 15:49.147
Those all sound like names
of super villains.

15:49.171 --> 15:49.950
Nope.

15:49.951 --> 15:52.919
They are brand names for
a structural insecticide.

15:52.954 --> 15:55.922
So Toby was in a structure that
had recently been fumigated.

15:55.957 --> 15:57.690
Yep. And sulfuryl
fluoride is

15:57.725 --> 15:59.425
an extremely deadly gas.

15:59.460 --> 16:00.629
So Toby had been
gassed to death.

16:00.630 --> 16:01.727
Nope.

16:01.729 --> 16:04.130
Okay, Dr. Hodgins,
can you cut to the chase here?

16:04.165 --> 16:06.195
It's not always the destination,
it's the journey.

16:06.219 --> 16:07.134
Nope,

16:07.135 --> 16:09.468
it's the destination.
Okay,

16:09.504 --> 16:11.737
sulfuryl fluoride
is highly regulated,

16:11.773 --> 16:14.473
so much so that only one
company in all of DC

16:14.509 --> 16:16.342
is licensed to use
it-- a company

16:16.377 --> 16:18.945
called Insects No More--
so they're sending over

16:18.980 --> 16:20.913
the names of their
most recent jobs.

16:20.949 --> 16:23.683
Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?
Nope.

16:23.718 --> 16:25.184
Okay,

16:25.220 --> 16:27.186
if any of the names on that list

16:27.222 --> 16:30.489
are known drug dealers,
we may actually be in luck.

16:30.525 --> 16:32.358
I found traces
of cocaine

16:32.393 --> 16:33.626
in the victim's
nasal cavity.

16:33.661 --> 16:34.727
What, a drug deal gone wrong?

16:34.762 --> 16:35.962
Wouldn't be
the first time.

16:35.997 --> 16:37.697
Fortunately,
there's another powder

16:37.732 --> 16:39.031
mixed in with the cocaine.

16:39.067 --> 16:40.866
Fortunately?
Sometimes dealers

16:40.902 --> 16:44.237
mix cocaine with other drugs
to create their own signature blend.

16:44.272 --> 16:45.805
The DEA tracks

16:45.840 --> 16:47.707
these blends and where
they're currently being sold.

16:47.742 --> 16:50.676
So we may be able to find out
where Toby bought this.

16:50.712 --> 16:53.879
Yup, and if we're lucky,
who he bought it from.

17:00.488 --> 17:02.722
After finding the cocaine,

17:02.757 --> 17:05.023
Cam reexamined
Toby's nasal septum

17:05.059 --> 17:07.126
and discovered perforation.

17:07.161 --> 17:10.663
You're telling me he had a hole
in his nose because of the cocaine?

17:10.698 --> 17:14.333
The degree of damage suggests
that he'd been using heavily

17:14.368 --> 17:15.901
for a while.

17:15.936 --> 17:17.303
Wall Street and cocaine, right?

17:17.338 --> 17:18.569
Now you can understand
my suspicion.

17:18.593 --> 17:20.089
Booth,
capitalism requires...

17:20.089 --> 17:22.642
Ah. I'm not the only one
who hates the business.

17:22.676 --> 17:24.042
Aubrey does, too.
Do you know that

17:24.078 --> 17:25.845
his father was a
Wall Street guy?

17:25.880 --> 17:28.146
Owned his own investment firm.
Then I would think

17:28.182 --> 17:31.684
that he would appreciate
the need for strong financial markets.

17:31.719 --> 17:34.820
His father was arrested
for securities fraud

17:34.856 --> 17:38.124
when Aubrey was
13 years old.

17:38.159 --> 17:40.059
All right, he ran
a Ponzi scheme--

17:40.094 --> 17:42.228
he bilked clients
out of millions.

17:42.263 --> 17:44.330
Oh, so his dad's in jail?

17:44.365 --> 17:46.299
Nope. He skipped bail,
hopped on a plane

17:46.334 --> 17:50.503
to, uh, Croatia, and
he left a single mom

17:50.538 --> 17:53.906
with a 13-year-old boy
completely broke.

17:55.410 --> 17:57.710
That must have been
very difficult for him.

17:57.745 --> 17:59.679
Took me years
to process the fact

17:59.714 --> 18:01.380
that my parents left me.

18:01.416 --> 18:04.417
Right, but your parents
left to keep you safe,

18:04.452 --> 18:06.719
not to save their own skin.

18:06.754 --> 18:09.088
Do you think he can be
objective enough

18:09.123 --> 18:10.790
to work on the case?

18:12.327 --> 18:14.360
I don't know.

18:17.632 --> 18:19.365
I finished reconstructing

18:19.400 --> 18:21.467
the victim's skull,
and, of course, found

18:21.502 --> 18:24.103
exactly what we were looking for.
Comminuted fracturing.

18:24.138 --> 18:25.938
The damage to the frontal bone

18:25.973 --> 18:28.641
would have resulted
in severe cerebral contusions.

18:28.676 --> 18:30.743
Meaning I found
cause of death.

18:30.778 --> 18:32.778
Not too bad, huh?
You were merely

18:32.814 --> 18:34.246
following the instructions
given to you.

18:34.282 --> 18:36.082
So that's how you
want to play it?

18:36.117 --> 18:39.752
Okay. Not a problem,
because this well runs deep.

18:39.787 --> 18:41.520
Very,<i> very</i> deep.

18:41.556 --> 18:46.525
Dr. Wells, I often find you
to be a real pain in my ass.

18:47.462 --> 18:49.462
Wow. If I wasn't so shocked,

18:49.497 --> 18:51.297
I might be offended.
The occasional

18:51.332 --> 18:54.200
curse word can serve
as a healthy form

18:54.235 --> 18:57.136
of nonviolent retribution.
So you swore

18:57.171 --> 19:00.139
to stop yourself from hitting me?
Given your personality,

19:00.174 --> 19:02.742
I'd imagine you're
quite used to that.

19:02.777 --> 19:04.910
There appear to be

19:04.946 --> 19:06.846
multiple points of impact
on this wound.

19:06.881 --> 19:08.881
Meaning the victim was bashed

19:08.916 --> 19:10.416
in the head
more than once.

19:10.451 --> 19:11.784
With what appears to be

19:11.819 --> 19:13.753
the corner of a heavy object.

19:13.788 --> 19:15.020
A brick, maybe.

19:15.056 --> 19:17.423
Quite a careless
supposition,

19:17.458 --> 19:19.859
since there doesn't seem to be
any rough trace in the wound.

19:19.894 --> 19:21.394
But...
you're inexperienced.

19:21.429 --> 19:23.763
Perhaps we'll have a better
idea of what struck him

19:23.798 --> 19:26.232
when you separate
the peri- and postmortem damage

19:26.267 --> 19:28.033
on the rest of the bones.

19:28.069 --> 19:30.169
Dr. Brennan?

19:30.204 --> 19:32.171
How am I supposed
to prove myself

19:32.206 --> 19:33.939
when you keep
giving me orders

19:33.975 --> 19:36.575
that interfere with my
investigatory methods?

19:36.611 --> 19:39.311
You have an IQ of 160--
figure it out.

19:43.484 --> 19:47.253
So, this is a map showing every
job Insects No More has done

19:47.288 --> 19:48.854
in DC over the past month.

19:48.890 --> 19:50.923
There's got to be
50 jobs here.

19:50.958 --> 19:53.192
Yeah, it was a little
overwhelming for Angie, too.

19:53.227 --> 19:55.027
<i>But</i> remember
the powder you found

19:55.062 --> 19:56.595
in the cocaine?

19:56.631 --> 19:58.497
Well, that is not a drug,

19:58.533 --> 20:00.900
it's a pollen.

20:00.935 --> 20:02.501
A Hungarian oak pollen,
to be exact.

20:02.537 --> 20:04.303
Exact is good.

20:04.338 --> 20:05.971
We'll take exact.
So, Hungarian oaks

20:06.007 --> 20:08.407
are only grown
in a handful of areas in DC.

20:08.443 --> 20:09.809
And I'm guessing
the area surrounding

20:09.844 --> 20:11.877
the playground
isn't one of them.

20:11.913 --> 20:13.479
Not even close.

20:13.514 --> 20:14.814
Check this out.

20:14.849 --> 20:17.316
So, these are
the only four

20:17.351 --> 20:20.486
locations the trees exist in DC.

20:20.521 --> 20:23.088
Now all we have to do is find
a recently fumigated house

20:23.124 --> 20:25.024
near those oaks.
No problem.

20:25.059 --> 20:28.527
So, two weeks ago, Insects
No More fumigated...

20:28.563 --> 20:30.896
this house
on a Hungarian oak-lined street

20:30.932 --> 20:33.532
in Woodley Park.

20:33.568 --> 20:35.968
Woodley Park?
That's a couple of blocks away

20:36.003 --> 20:37.403
from the victim's office.

20:37.438 --> 20:40.239
This must have been
where he went after work.

20:44.011 --> 20:45.544
A ridiculous house

20:45.580 --> 20:47.813
with a bunch of obnoxious cars
in the driveway.

20:47.849 --> 20:51.116
This is either Toby's dealer's place
or one of the other traders.

20:51.152 --> 20:52.418
The trader he worked with,

20:52.453 --> 20:54.587
Derek Kaplan-- his
name is on the lease.

20:54.622 --> 20:57.656
Wow, man, these idiots, they
have way too much money.

20:57.692 --> 21:00.292
Wait, so Kaplan was here with
Toby the night of his death,

21:00.328 --> 21:02.995
and he didn't bother to mention
that when we were in his office?

21:03.030 --> 21:05.331
Sounds like he has
something to hide.

21:10.805 --> 21:14.740
The blow is in the den
and the girls are all over.

21:14.775 --> 21:16.775
Come on in,
twinsies.

21:16.811 --> 21:18.777
Are you kidding me?

21:18.813 --> 21:21.547

21:44.805 --> 21:46.338
In the middle
of the afternoon?

21:46.374 --> 21:47.940
Well, what's the point

21:47.975 --> 21:49.695
if you can't have
a nice lunch now and then?

21:49.710 --> 21:52.678
I... Right, okay, that's it.
FBI. Break it down.

21:53.981 --> 21:55.314
Let's go.
Okay, Snuffy--

21:55.349 --> 21:57.316
get the bill out of the nose.

21:57.351 --> 21:58.684
Come on, put it down.

22:04.051 --> 22:06.051
<i>We weren't hurting anybody.</i>

22:06.086 --> 22:08.153
I cannot believe you just
shut down my party.

22:08.189 --> 22:10.022
Hey, look, before
I get into the long list

22:10.057 --> 22:12.257
of illegal activities going on
around here, did you not think

22:12.293 --> 22:13.975
that we would know that Toby
was here the night he died?

22:13.999 --> 22:15.061
Well, I was kind of

22:15.062 --> 22:16.822
hoping that you wouldn't
find out.

22:16.830 --> 22:18.163
All right, that

22:18.199 --> 22:20.032
probably wasn't
the right response

22:20.067 --> 22:24.469
but I'm really, really
coked up right now.

22:24.505 --> 22:27.105
I should probably call one of my lawyers.
I don't care how many lawyers

22:27.141 --> 22:30.008
you have, it's not gonna help
keep you out of jail for murder.

22:30.044 --> 22:31.877
Whoa. I didn't kill Toby.

22:31.912 --> 22:34.279
We were just partying that
night with some of the guys.

22:34.315 --> 22:36.882
Right, right, with the drugs
and the hookers.

22:36.917 --> 22:39.651
Well, I mean, I said it was a party,
didn't I? Techs found traces

22:39.687 --> 22:41.353
of blood in the back bedroom.

22:41.388 --> 22:43.589
Looks like somebody
tried to clean it up.

22:45.125 --> 22:48.393
Oh, man.

22:48.429 --> 22:51.430
I'm calling it
a night, Dr. Wells.

22:51.465 --> 22:53.699
We can come back and hit it
fresh in the morning.

22:53.734 --> 22:56.168
Dr. Brennan already
cursed me out, I'm not

22:56.203 --> 22:58.337
leaving until I find something
that impresses the crap

22:58.372 --> 23:00.138
out of her
tomorrow morning.

23:00.174 --> 23:01.873
Dr. Brennan cursed you out?

23:01.909 --> 23:04.343
She said I was
a pain in her ass.

23:04.378 --> 23:06.078
Not a pain in <i> the</i> ass.

23:06.113 --> 23:09.314
A pain in <i> her</i> ass.
Specifically, her ass.

23:09.350 --> 23:11.216
Way to go, Dr. Brennan.

23:11.252 --> 23:13.518
So have you found anything?
Superficially,

23:13.554 --> 23:15.554
all this damage appears
to be the result of some

23:15.589 --> 23:19.224
horrifically dangerous
playground equipment.

23:19.260 --> 23:21.260
Except for this--

23:21.295 --> 23:25.130
a perimortem incision to the
distal end of the right radius.

23:25.165 --> 23:27.065
Looks like
a defensive wound.

23:27.101 --> 23:29.568
Based on the U-shaped
kerf floor,

23:29.603 --> 23:31.903
the weapon that was used
to cause this wound

23:31.939 --> 23:34.806
was some sort of thin,
cylindrical object that came

23:34.842 --> 23:37.175
to a sharp point.
Excellent work.

23:37.211 --> 23:38.477
Well, you
know that.

23:38.512 --> 23:40.212
Will you tell that
to Dr. Brennan?

23:40.247 --> 23:41.980
Good night, Dr. Wells.

23:48.155 --> 23:49.855
So I stitched together
all the photos

23:49.890 --> 23:51.823
taken by the FBI techs and

23:51.859 --> 23:54.760
created a virtual crime scene.
The room is

23:54.795 --> 23:56.762
full of thick, solid corners.
The victim could have smashed

23:56.797 --> 23:58.764
his face on any one of them.
Then maybe we'd have

23:58.799 --> 24:01.333
better luck looking
for the sharp, spiky weapon

24:01.368 --> 24:03.468
that was used to create
the teeny, tiny

24:03.504 --> 24:05.871
microscopic nick
that I discovered.

24:05.906 --> 24:08.563
While doing the work that
Dr. Brennan asked you to do.

24:08.587 --> 24:09.776
If I remember

24:09.777 --> 24:12.177
correctly, and I always do...
Hey,

24:12.212 --> 24:13.712
hey, hey.

24:13.747 --> 24:17.049
What about the candlestick?

24:17.084 --> 24:19.951
Oh, Angela's
right. The spike

24:19.987 --> 24:21.453
meant to hold the candle
could have been used

24:21.488 --> 24:23.288
to slice the victim's arm.

24:23.324 --> 24:26.525
While the square base could have
been used to smash his face in.

24:26.560 --> 24:28.560
Congratulations, Angela.

24:28.595 --> 24:31.630
I think you just found
our murder weapon.

24:31.665 --> 24:34.533
I'm surprised you didn't
notice that, Oliver.

24:36.537 --> 24:39.171
Yeah, I've been looking
through Horizon's financials.

24:39.206 --> 24:42.207
Same here. So Mason
assigned Kaplan

24:42.242 --> 24:44.643
to work with Toby
last month, but

24:44.678 --> 24:46.978
Toby dismissed him from the
high-frequency trading division.

24:47.014 --> 24:49.514
So Kaplan has a motive
as well as means

24:49.550 --> 24:51.783
and opportunity.
Just got a text from the lab-- they ran

24:51.819 --> 24:54.252
the prints from the bloody candlestick.
Oh, so we

24:54.288 --> 24:55.190
have enough to bust Kaplan.

24:55.213 --> 24:57.213
No, they're not from him.
They're from

24:57.224 --> 24:59.424
one of the hookers at the
party-- a McKenzie Solloway.

24:59.460 --> 25:01.093
I'll let you talk to her.

25:01.128 --> 25:02.728
Bring her in, will you?

25:11.305 --> 25:13.572
I don't know what you heard,
but it's not true.

25:13.607 --> 25:17.242
I run a legitimate business
selling linens online.

25:17.277 --> 25:19.911
Linens. Used?

25:19.947 --> 25:23.682
Our agents found Toby Wachlin's
phone, wallet and wedding ring

25:23.717 --> 25:25.183
in your apartment.

25:25.219 --> 25:28.019
Okay, look, I know that
you were with Toby Wachlin

25:28.055 --> 25:29.588
the night that he was killed.

25:29.623 --> 25:30.922
Toby's a good client.

25:30.958 --> 25:32.057
He ordered some sheets,

25:32.092 --> 25:33.625
I happened to be
in the neighborhood,

25:33.660 --> 25:34.893
so I dropped them off.

25:34.928 --> 25:36.695
We found your prints
on the candlestick

25:36.730 --> 25:39.064
that was used
to beat him to death.

25:39.099 --> 25:40.532
Those were $4,000 sheets.

25:40.567 --> 25:42.300
And Toby didn't
have the cash,

25:42.336 --> 25:45.237
so, yeah, I took his
stuff as collateral.

25:45.272 --> 25:48.774
He flipped out,
he came charging at me,

25:48.809 --> 25:52.744
so I picked up the candlestick,
and I swung it at him.

25:52.780 --> 25:56.681
And you just kept bashing away
until he was dead, right?

25:56.717 --> 25:59.251
I nicked his arm,
that's all.

25:59.286 --> 26:02.254
Toby got the message.

26:02.289 --> 26:05.457
He said he'd get me my money,
but he needed his phone back.

26:05.492 --> 26:06.858
His phone?

26:06.894 --> 26:08.794
You had the guy's wallet
and his wedding ring,

26:08.829 --> 26:10.462
and all he cared about
was his phone?

26:10.497 --> 26:11.963
I said he'd
get it back,

26:11.999 --> 26:14.766
when I got my money.

26:14.802 --> 26:16.835
He said okay and left,
but he never came back,

26:16.870 --> 26:18.403
so I took his stuff.

26:18.439 --> 26:20.806
I figured he'd call me
when he got my money.

26:20.841 --> 26:23.208
Well, he couldn't withdraw
that kind of money from an ATM.

26:23.243 --> 26:25.911
So, where's Toby planning
on getting $4,000

26:25.946 --> 26:27.479
in the middle
of the night?

26:27.514 --> 26:28.680
Not my problem.

26:28.715 --> 26:31.416
Actually, it is
your problem, McKenzie.

26:31.452 --> 26:33.685
And it's kind of a big one.

26:36.897 --> 26:41.075
So it was hooker in the bedroom,
with the candlestick.

26:41.205 --> 26:43.239
Tell me this case is not
starting to sound

26:43.274 --> 26:44.607
like a game of "Clue."

26:44.642 --> 26:47.443
And it is a game
I plan on winning.

26:47.478 --> 26:49.044
How's it coming over there?

26:49.080 --> 26:51.680
This looks like
it's vicuna wool.

26:51.716 --> 26:54.516
Wait, that's the same
as the victim's suit.

26:54.552 --> 26:56.085
Check this out.

26:56.120 --> 26:57.586
So, then this must be
the candlestick

26:57.622 --> 26:59.154
that sliced the victim's arm.

26:59.190 --> 27:01.557
Unfortunately, the base
of the candlestick is too thick

27:01.592 --> 27:04.226
to have caused the comminuted
fracturing to the frontal bone.

27:04.262 --> 27:06.095
So, then this isn't
the murder weapon.

27:06.130 --> 27:09.164
Which means I still have a
chance to take down Dr. Brennan.

27:09.200 --> 27:10.866
Okay, look,
I like a good underdog story

27:10.901 --> 27:13.669
as much as the next guy,
but my money's on Dr. B.

27:13.704 --> 27:15.170
What the hell,
Hodgins?

27:15.206 --> 27:16.772
I thought we were,
you know, beard buddies.

27:16.807 --> 27:18.474
Sorry, dude, but I've
worked with this woman

27:18.509 --> 27:20.142
for over ten years,
and I have never

27:20.177 --> 27:22.011
not once ever,
seen anyone better.

27:22.046 --> 27:23.946
And, as for the beards,
when I look at you,

27:23.981 --> 27:26.448
I feel like I'm looking in the
mirror, and I have a hangover.

27:26.484 --> 27:28.817
You might want to, you know,
clean up a bit there.

27:28.853 --> 27:30.753
I'm gonna remember
this conversation

27:30.788 --> 27:33.389
when I'm the one running things,
and you are looking for a job.

27:33.424 --> 27:35.457
In the world where scenario
exists, I won't need a job,

27:35.493 --> 27:37.293
because I will be a power
forward for the Lakers.

27:37.328 --> 27:41.563
Beneath the postmortem damage
there appears to be evidence

27:41.599 --> 27:43.866
of hemorrhagic staining
to the cortical bone

27:43.901 --> 27:45.634
on the right side mandible.

27:45.670 --> 27:49.638
It's difficult to see,
of course not for me.

27:49.674 --> 27:51.974
The bone bruising appears
to be circular in shape,

27:52.009 --> 27:54.977
and about 25 millimeters
in diameter.

27:55.012 --> 27:56.512
So, maybe the face
of a hammer?

27:56.547 --> 27:58.280
The wound hardly seems
severe enough.

27:58.316 --> 28:00.683
I mean, even the light swinging
of a hammer would result

28:00.718 --> 28:03.185
in slight depression fracture.

28:03.220 --> 28:06.255
Sounds like you two aren't
having any more luck than I am.

28:06.290 --> 28:08.324
I analyzed the blood
found in the bedroom

28:08.359 --> 28:10.693
and discovered traces
of amylase,

28:10.728 --> 28:12.461
an enzyme found
in the salivary glands.

28:12.496 --> 28:15.431
Which suggests that the blood
came from a nose bleed

28:15.466 --> 28:17.066
and is not the result
of the murder.

28:17.101 --> 28:18.534
So, the prostitute was
telling the truth.

28:18.569 --> 28:21.070
Toby wasn't killed
in the bedroom.

28:21.105 --> 28:23.806
<i> Look, she still</i>
<i>could have killed Toby.</i>

28:23.841 --> 28:26.075
She just probably didn't
do it in the back bedroom.

28:26.110 --> 28:27.743
She won't tell us
where she went after.

28:27.778 --> 28:29.078
Probably protecting
another client.

28:29.113 --> 28:30.646
Right, or herself.
I'll tell you what,

28:30.681 --> 28:32.348
why don't we just ask
some of the other girls

28:32.383 --> 28:33.782
who were at the party?
You know what?

28:33.818 --> 28:35.150
They're all
gonna cooperate.

28:35.186 --> 28:37.419
Please, please tell me
it isn't true.

28:37.455 --> 28:39.655
It-it's a joke, right?
I mean, they're messing with me?

28:39.690 --> 28:41.623
They've got to be
messing with me.

28:41.659 --> 28:43.125
Slow down,
who's messing with you?

28:43.160 --> 28:44.693
The other traders' wives
have been talking...

28:44.729 --> 28:48.263
You would know.

28:48.299 --> 28:51.934
Was Toby taking drugs...

28:51.969 --> 28:54.103
and sleeping with other women?

28:55.606 --> 28:57.106
Oh, my God.

28:57.141 --> 28:59.842
It is true.

28:59.877 --> 29:02.144
How did I not see this?
Gone all the time,

29:02.179 --> 29:04.012
and I believed he was working.

29:04.048 --> 29:05.848
I'm so gullible, such a fool.

29:05.883 --> 29:08.083
Look, your husband was dealing
with a lot of problems...

29:08.119 --> 29:09.585
Trust me, you're better off.

29:09.620 --> 29:11.553
Not now.
Might as well face it.

29:11.589 --> 29:14.656
Your husband stopped
loving you a long time ago.

29:14.692 --> 29:15.624
Aubrey.

29:15.659 --> 29:16.892
He told me he loved me.

29:16.927 --> 29:17.927
Every morning.

29:17.928 --> 29:19.261
If he really
loved you,

29:19.296 --> 29:21.196
he would've put your well-being
ahead of his own

29:21.232 --> 29:22.398
no matter what, okay?

29:22.433 --> 29:24.400
But he chose
to rip a family apart

29:24.435 --> 29:25.501
in order to
get rich.

29:25.536 --> 29:26.502
Look, that's enough.
Really?

29:26.537 --> 29:28.704
Is it?
Yes.

29:28.739 --> 29:31.340
My-my husband might
have had problems,

29:31.375 --> 29:33.208
but...

29:33.244 --> 29:36.779
he's dead.

29:44.121 --> 29:46.455
I'm sorry, okay?

29:46.490 --> 29:49.158
I didn't mean...

29:49.193 --> 29:50.826
I'm sorry.

30:02.940 --> 30:07.576
Okay, I have everything we
need to rehydrate an eyeball.

30:07.611 --> 30:09.278
Except for a
good reason.

30:09.313 --> 30:10.813
Well, Toby didn't care

30:10.848 --> 30:13.182
that the hooker took
his wedding ring or his wallet.

30:13.217 --> 30:15.617
All he wanted was
his phone, right?

30:15.653 --> 30:17.553
Which means there's something
important in that phone.

30:17.588 --> 30:20.722
And your eyeballs weren't
good enough to see it?

30:20.758 --> 30:22.724
Well, there's one locked file
on the phone.

30:22.760 --> 30:26.395
And it can only be unlocked
using Toby's iris.

30:26.430 --> 30:29.264
Ah, so you need
to scan the iris.

30:29.300 --> 30:31.099
I get it.

30:31.135 --> 30:34.269
Well, I'll just inject
a little saline,

30:34.305 --> 30:38.207
and have this raisin looking
like a grape in no time.

30:38.242 --> 30:39.741
Wow, that is...

30:39.777 --> 30:43.312
possibly the worst
and the most wonderful thing

30:43.347 --> 30:44.713
I have ever seen.

30:44.748 --> 30:47.349
Okay.

30:49.386 --> 30:50.853
All right, we're in.

30:50.888 --> 30:52.821
So, this is an audio file.

30:52.857 --> 30:54.423
There's 500K here, Toby.

30:54.458 --> 30:56.325
I need this money
in Kevin Rovito's pocket

30:56.360 --> 30:57.593
as soon as possible.

30:57.628 --> 30:58.794
Who's Kevin Rovito?

30:58.829 --> 31:00.095
I don't know.

31:00.130 --> 31:01.830
I'm serious, Toby,
I want our computers

31:01.866 --> 31:05.067
right next to their server
no matter how much it costs us.

31:05.102 --> 31:06.835
Okay...

31:06.871 --> 31:08.237
He is the chief
technical officer

31:08.272 --> 31:09.438
of the CitiCore Stock Exchange.

31:09.473 --> 31:12.741
He recorded his boss
planning a bribe.

31:12.776 --> 31:15.744
Every high-frequency trading
firm wants their computer

31:15.779 --> 31:17.980
as close to the main
server as possible,

31:18.015 --> 31:20.616
because it can shave off
nanoseconds of time

31:20.651 --> 31:23.118
that it takes to make a trade.
Nanoseconds?

31:23.153 --> 31:25.821
Yeah, and one or two
in your favor can make you,

31:25.856 --> 31:27.856
like, tens of millions
of dollars.

31:27.892 --> 31:32.194
A 500 grand bribe is just
the cost of doing business.

31:32.229 --> 31:34.229
Illegal business.

31:36.800 --> 31:40.269
So, you were right
about Toby's boss.

31:40.304 --> 31:43.238
You know one, you know 'em all.

31:43.274 --> 31:44.773
Right.

31:45.976 --> 31:47.409
Look, what happened
back there...

31:47.444 --> 31:48.644
I'm really sorry,

31:48.679 --> 31:49.878
Booth.

31:49.914 --> 31:51.413
It was out of line.

31:51.448 --> 31:54.049
Normally I'm a good agent...
No, you are

31:54.084 --> 31:56.184
a good agent.

31:58.022 --> 32:00.856
So you think you got it
out of your system?

32:02.326 --> 32:03.959
I don't know.

32:03.994 --> 32:05.327
Well, we better
figure that out

32:05.362 --> 32:06.862
because we just harpooned
a big whale,

32:06.897 --> 32:09.231
and I'm gonna need some help
reeling him in.

32:09.266 --> 32:12.434
Maybe you should take
Dr. Brennan this time.

32:12.469 --> 32:15.170
I've been monopolizing you lately.
Look, you're the one

32:15.205 --> 32:17.205
who said we should be
looking at Toby's boss.

32:17.241 --> 32:19.942
Yeah, I got a, uh,
mountain of paperwork.

32:19.977 --> 32:24.713
It should all be filed if you're
gonna bring him in, right?

32:24.748 --> 32:27.516
Okay. All right.

32:27.551 --> 32:29.284
Do your paperwork,
and I'll, uh...

32:29.320 --> 32:31.119
I'll take Bones.

32:38.262 --> 32:40.195
Sure.
Let me call you back.

32:40.230 --> 32:42.197
Mason Barnes, you're
under arrest for suspicion

32:42.232 --> 32:44.566
to commit securities fraud.
You sure you know

32:44.602 --> 32:46.768
what you're doing, son?
I'm a very powerful man.

32:46.804 --> 32:48.403
Not today you're not.
Turn around. Let's go.

32:48.439 --> 32:50.038
Booth, these handles
Yeah.

32:50.074 --> 32:55.577
match the wound
we found on Toby's mandible.

32:55.613 --> 32:58.280
Oh, and there's blood
on the corner of the desk.

32:58.315 --> 32:59.716
This is the murder weapon.

32:59.740 --> 33:01.484
Right. Looks like we'll
be adding a murder charge, huh?

33:01.485 --> 33:03.085
Let's go. Come on.

33:07.521 --> 33:10.165
There's 500K here, Toby.
I need this money

33:10.166 --> 33:12.700
in Kevin Rovito's pocket
as soon as possible.

33:12.736 --> 33:14.157
Toby was blackmailing you?

33:14.462 --> 33:16.639
After all I did for
that son of a bitch,

33:16.640 --> 33:18.006
all the money I made for him.

33:18.041 --> 33:19.507
He just wanted more and more.

33:19.543 --> 33:21.242
He learned
from the master,

33:21.278 --> 33:22.911
didn't he? So what happened?
You got sick and tired

33:22.946 --> 33:24.479
of paying him? So what
did you do? You took his head

33:24.514 --> 33:26.414
and you just slammed him
into the desk?

33:26.449 --> 33:28.383
As much as I'd like
to take credit for killing him,

33:28.418 --> 33:31.119
it wasn't me.
Okay, then how do you explain

33:31.154 --> 33:34.322
all the evidence we have on you?
I leave my office door unlocked.

33:34.357 --> 33:36.791
Anybody could have been in there with him.
Pinning this

33:36.826 --> 33:40.495
on "anybody," that's not gonna
help you. Good thing you have

33:40.530 --> 33:44.499
a lot of money because lawyers
are very expensive.

33:48.905 --> 33:52.240
Intersecting radiating
fracture line tells me

33:52.275 --> 33:54.742
that the victim's skull
was smashed into the corner

33:54.778 --> 33:58.046
of the desk a total
of... nine times.

33:58.081 --> 34:00.448
Although the extent of
these injuries suggests

34:00.483 --> 34:03.585
that Toby was dead following
the third or fourth blow.

34:03.620 --> 34:06.187
Sounds like Mason was
really pissed off.

34:06.222 --> 34:08.889
I guess I would've been the same.
We don't yet have

34:08.925 --> 34:11.326
the evidence to conclude
that Mason Barnes is the killer,

34:11.360 --> 34:13.127
Dr. Wells.
Which means

34:13.163 --> 34:16.130
I still have a chance to be
the one to bring this case home.

34:16.166 --> 34:17.831
Oh,

34:17.867 --> 34:19.434
you are swearing in your head
right now, aren't you?

34:19.469 --> 34:20.735
I believe
the phrase

34:20.770 --> 34:23.237
is "like a naval seaman."

34:23.273 --> 34:25.406
I believe it's "like a sailor."

34:25.442 --> 34:27.942
That's what I said.
We should focus on the top

34:27.978 --> 34:29.811
and back portions
of the skull.

34:29.846 --> 34:32.447
Because that's where the killer
would have placed his hands

34:32.482 --> 34:35.483
during the beating.
The cranial sutures

34:35.518 --> 34:37.952
would have provided
an easy exit point

34:37.987 --> 34:40.121
for the force of the blows.

34:40.156 --> 34:41.656
But I'm sure you knew that.

34:41.690 --> 34:43.391
Yes. Of course.

34:43.426 --> 34:45.726
Because the pressure
would have forced

34:45.762 --> 34:47.829
the sutures to pop, creating...

34:47.864 --> 34:50.531
the jagged edge.
And one of the pieces

34:50.567 --> 34:53.400
of the exposed bone could have
easily come in contact

34:53.436 --> 34:55.402
with the killer's hands.

34:55.438 --> 34:56.804
Are you looking

34:56.840 --> 34:59.674
for that microscopic nick
on the edge

34:59.709 --> 35:01.209
of the sagittal suture?

35:01.244 --> 35:03.711
Damn it.
There's something

35:03.747 --> 35:06.280
in the wound.
Something shiny.

35:08.518 --> 35:11.552
I'll give this to Dr. Hodgins
for a detailed analysis.

35:11.588 --> 35:13.321
I guess
you just officially

35:13.356 --> 35:15.323
handed me my ass, Dr. Brennan?

35:15.358 --> 35:16.858
Yes. As long
as you are here,

35:16.893 --> 35:18.993
I will consider it my obligation

35:19.029 --> 35:23.731
to continue trying
to destroy you, Dr. Wells.

35:23.767 --> 35:25.400
I guess I sort of asked
for that, huh?

35:25.435 --> 35:27.301
Yes, you did.
The Spanish writer

35:27.337 --> 35:29.237
Baltasar Gracián once wrote,

35:29.272 --> 35:32.273
"A wise man gets more use
from his enemies

35:32.308 --> 35:34.676
than a fool from his friends."

35:34.711 --> 35:36.678
Don't stop trying,
Dr. Wells.

35:36.713 --> 35:38.780
Second best can
be good enough

35:38.815 --> 35:42.183
for many people.

35:46.589 --> 35:49.357
Mason claims he was at home
with an escort of his own

35:49.392 --> 35:51.025
the night
that Toby was killed.

35:51.061 --> 35:54.028
He was kind enough to pass along
his smart phone as proof.

35:54.064 --> 35:56.764
I'm not sure "kind"
is the right word.

35:56.800 --> 35:59.867
Is there any way to verify
when these photos were taken?

35:59.903 --> 36:01.402
Yeah, I'll do that now.

36:01.438 --> 36:04.639
No, the metadata all lines up.

36:04.674 --> 36:07.442
Looks like he was telling the truth.
He wasn't in the office that night.

36:07.477 --> 36:10.111
Okay, so that particulate
that Dr. Brennan found

36:10.146 --> 36:12.547
in the victim's skull, it turned
out to be a piece of emerald.

36:12.582 --> 36:14.982
Emerald is fairly easily
to scratch.

36:15.018 --> 36:16.784
Coming in contact
with a sharp piece of bone

36:16.820 --> 36:18.619
could definitely chip it.
So...

36:18.655 --> 36:21.289
what, are we looking
for a jeweler now?

36:25.428 --> 36:27.395
According to the Horizon server,

36:27.430 --> 36:29.831
you logged into your computer
at 2:00 a.m.

36:29.866 --> 36:31.699
Those files are
confidential.

36:31.735 --> 36:33.468
We got a warrant.

36:34.571 --> 36:36.971
Okay, so I was there.

36:37.006 --> 36:39.774
Sometimes I come in early
to work the foreign markets.

36:39.809 --> 36:42.110
But I never saw Toby.
It was just me.

36:42.145 --> 36:44.145
Let me get this straight.
So it was just you

36:44.180 --> 36:45.847
and Toby there
but you never saw him?

36:45.882 --> 36:47.949
You're actually gonna go
with that story?

36:47.984 --> 36:50.952
You caught Toby
stealing cash

36:50.987 --> 36:54.192
from your boss and you smashed
his head into the desk.

36:54.216 --> 36:54.757
Wait, so now

36:54.758 --> 36:56.190
you're saying I killed the guy

36:56.226 --> 36:57.859
because he was stealing
someone else's money?

36:57.894 --> 36:59.393
That's right.
Because of your famous temper.

36:59.429 --> 37:01.996
But then again,
this wasn't about the-the money.

37:02.031 --> 37:04.165
It was all about the team,
right?

37:05.770 --> 37:07.314
I want a lawyer.

37:07.315 --> 37:08.648
I'm done talking.

37:08.683 --> 37:10.483
There's blood
on the stone, Booth.

37:10.518 --> 37:13.052
Look at that.
You don't have to say a word.

37:13.087 --> 37:15.288
'Cause we have all the evidence
we need

37:15.323 --> 37:16.923
right there.

37:16.958 --> 37:19.826
You chipped your ring
while you were assaulting him.

37:19.861 --> 37:22.728
It lodged
in his skull.

37:26.167 --> 37:28.167
Y-You don't understand.
I didn't...

37:28.203 --> 37:30.336
I didn't mean to kill him.

37:30.371 --> 37:32.738
It was... it was an accident.
You smashed Toby's head

37:32.774 --> 37:34.440
into the desk nine times.

37:34.475 --> 37:36.642
I was just trying
to teach him a lesson.

37:36.678 --> 37:40.379
I mean, without loyalty,
we're nothing.

38:15.650 --> 38:18.017
Booth told me
I could find you here.

38:18.052 --> 38:21.053
Dr. Brennan. Just saw the news.

38:21.089 --> 38:23.723
You two got a nice shout-out
for busting the head of Horizon.

38:23.758 --> 38:25.558
And the murderer.

38:28.997 --> 38:33.432
I imagine you would like
to be receiving those accolades.

38:33.468 --> 38:36.168
Booth told you what I did, huh?

38:36.204 --> 38:38.671
Yes.

38:38.706 --> 38:41.507
And about your father.

38:41.542 --> 38:44.043
Yeah, that's my problem.

38:44.078 --> 38:45.411
You know, you don't have to...

38:45.446 --> 38:47.113
I know.

38:47.148 --> 38:50.449
My father was a criminal, too.

38:50.485 --> 38:52.585
I was 15 when
I was abandoned.

38:52.620 --> 38:56.489
I-I was angry for years.

38:57.425 --> 38:59.358
How did you...

38:59.394 --> 39:02.094
get over it?

39:03.031 --> 39:06.198
I didn't.

39:06.234 --> 39:08.567
So this isn't a comforting talk.

39:08.603 --> 39:10.102
No.

39:10.138 --> 39:12.138
The pain is always there.

39:12.173 --> 39:16.375
The challenge is to not
try to make it go away.

39:16.411 --> 39:18.110
This is really not comforting.

39:18.146 --> 39:20.813
Fighting it is
the problem.

39:20.848 --> 39:25.685
We fight to try and change
the past or... push it away.

39:25.720 --> 39:30.189
But the pain
is part of who we are.

39:32.860 --> 39:36.696
It's like the discovery
of the quark.

39:36.731 --> 39:39.699
It upended all of our
theories about physics.

39:39.734 --> 39:42.935
There was fury,
fighting,

39:42.971 --> 39:44.704
but it was true.

39:44.739 --> 39:48.374
And when it was
finally accepted,

39:48.409 --> 39:52.044
it gave us a better
understanding of life.

39:52.080 --> 39:56.382
If we had denied it, there would
have been no progress.

39:56.417 --> 40:00.252
That was
a really brainy analogy.

40:00.288 --> 40:02.888
Because I'm very brainy.

40:05.994 --> 40:07.727
It's not easy,
Aubrey,

40:07.762 --> 40:11.897
but... nothing of value is.

40:14.836 --> 40:17.770
Thanks.

40:17.805 --> 40:19.538
So, I left

40:19.574 --> 40:22.241
my wallet at work. Perhaps
you'd like to buy me a beer

40:22.276 --> 40:24.210
out of gratitude?

40:24.245 --> 40:25.745
I'd like that very much.
I thought so.

40:25.780 --> 40:29.415
Can we, uh, get another one?

40:29.450 --> 40:36.122
♪ Shot, sold and bleed... ♪

40:36.157 --> 40:37.656
<i>Oh.</i>

40:37.692 --> 40:39.291
There she is.
Everything go okay with Aubrey?

40:39.327 --> 40:40.626
He'll be fine,
once he realizes

40:40.661 --> 40:42.461
this isn't something
he can solve.

40:42.497 --> 40:44.263
Well,
you know what,

40:44.298 --> 40:48.134
well, I figured if anyone could
talk to him, it'd be you.

40:48.169 --> 40:50.369
I thought I'd be home in time
to put Christine to bed.

40:50.405 --> 40:52.138
Did I miss her?
Yeah, she's brushing

40:52.173 --> 40:54.306
her teeth.
We had, uh, cake for dinner.

40:54.342 --> 40:56.609
I'm kidding.

40:56.644 --> 40:59.011
It was pie.

40:59.047 --> 41:01.981
I gather
you're no longer upset with her

41:02.016 --> 41:04.817
for using gateway profanity?
You know what,

41:04.852 --> 41:06.419
I'm, uh...
I'm cutting her some slack.

41:06.454 --> 41:08.154
The bunny didn't seem to mind.

41:08.189 --> 41:09.869
I'm waiting
for those big four-letter words

41:09.891 --> 41:11.524
and then I'll nail it down.

41:11.559 --> 41:13.659
I'm proud of you, Booth.
Thank you.

41:13.694 --> 41:15.227
Well, you know,
I'm a good guy.

41:15.263 --> 41:17.029
Oh, really?
 Yeah.

41:17.065 --> 41:19.265
- I'm ready for bed.
- Aw,

41:19.300 --> 41:21.667
I'll put her to bed.
Oh, okay.

41:21.702 --> 41:24.837
Good night, sweetheart.
Give me a hug.

41:24.872 --> 41:26.539
Good night, jackass.

41:27.375 --> 41:28.674
I beg your pardon?

41:28.709 --> 41:31.477
I said good night, jackass.

41:32.680 --> 41:33.712
Don't look at me.

41:33.748 --> 41:35.028
You told me not to say anything.

41:35.049 --> 41:37.550
Well, why did
you call Mommy a jackass?

41:37.585 --> 41:39.552
Because you said I could.

41:39.587 --> 41:41.921
I told my teacher that, too.

41:41.956 --> 41:43.923
Did you call your teacher
a jackass?

41:43.958 --> 41:45.791
Yes. You said I could.

41:45.827 --> 41:48.194
Not your teacher.
Why not?

41:48.229 --> 41:49.929
Yeah, why not, Mom?

41:49.964 --> 41:51.430
You're not helping, Booth.

41:51.466 --> 41:53.966
Come on, come on, now,
Mommy's gonna talk to us.

41:54.001 --> 41:57.203
Ooh.

41:57.238 --> 42:00.739
Okay, we are gonna sit here

42:00.775 --> 42:03.537
- and we are gonna listen to Mom explain to us
- and we are gonna listen to Mom explain to us

42:03.540 --> 42:05.471
why not.
Really?

42:05.506 --> 42:08.240
Mm-hmm.

42:10.669 --> 42:14.113
Really?
 Yep. Waiting.
