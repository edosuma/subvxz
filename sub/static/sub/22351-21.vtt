00:01.990 --> 00:05.990
>> Previously on "big
brother".

00:05.990 --> 00:08.990
The house was divided.

00:08.990 --> 00:12.990
"The sixth sense" alliance
on one side, James, Meg and

00:12.990 --> 00:15.990
Jackie on the other and John,
Becky and Steve somewhere in

00:15.990 --> 00:17.830
the middle.

00:17.830 --> 00:19.990
With James holding all the
power.

00:19.990 --> 00:22.990
>> I got someone right now,
I got the hoh key.

00:22.990 --> 00:27.990
I got my power of veto medal
onright now, he targeted a

00:27.990 --> 00:28.990
power couple.

00:28.990 --> 00:31.990
>> I have decided not to use
the power of veto.

00:31.990 --> 00:34.990
The country boy and his
allies wanted Shelli gone.

00:34.990 --> 00:37.990
>> Really the only thing I
ask is that we get Shelli

00:37.990 --> 00:38.990
out.

00:38.990 --> 00:40.990
Game wise Shelli is a bigger
threat than Clay.

00:40.990 --> 00:45.290
>> But Vanessa was tring to
slyly push her a

00:45.290 --> 00:46.990
venda-- agenda.

00:46.990 --> 00:49.990
>> You and Jackie spotted
the poker players tell.

00:49.990 --> 00:51.950
>> She's planning on
something.

00:51.950 --> 00:54.120
She was trying to put Clay
up to keep her.

00:54.120 --> 00:57.540
>> I don't see why it's
Vanessa.

00:57.540 --> 01:00.990
And if she does, this girl
is definitely going to

01:00.990 --> 01:01.990
battle.

01:01.990 --> 01:04.950
It is time for war.

01:04.950 --> 01:06.540
>> At the live eviction.

01:06.540 --> 01:10.990
>> Julie: By a vote of 9-0,
Clay, you are evicted from

01:10.990 --> 01:14.120
the Big Brother house.

01:14.120 --> 01:16.990
>> Vanessa got her wish.

01:16.990 --> 01:17.410
>> Whooo!

01:17.410 --> 01:21.990
>> A slippery race for power
began.

01:21.990 --> 01:24.120
Tonight who will claim the
head of household and which

01:24.120 --> 01:27.990
two house guests will be
nominated?

01:27.990 --> 01:29.990
Plus see the shocking fight
that happened right before

01:29.990 --> 01:31.990
the eviction.

01:31.990 --> 01:33.000
>> You going to hit me or
something, Clay.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.990
>> No, I'm telling you right
know.

01:35.990 --> 01:39.990
>> All this right now on
"Big Brother".

01:39.990 --> 01:49.990
>> There's nothing morass
call than a scorn of a woman,

01:49.990 --> 01:54.990
>> there's nothing morass
call than a scorn of a woman,

01:54.990 --> 02:00.990
captioning funded by CBS
>> oh my gosh.

02:24.990 --> 02:27.990
Oh, oh.

02:27.990 --> 02:30.990
>> In this hoh competition
you can go for head of

02:30.990 --> 02:33.990
householding a cash prize or
a never not pass.

02:33.990 --> 02:35.990
You can even go for all
three of these prizes.

02:35.990 --> 02:37.990
I really want revenge.

02:37.990 --> 02:40.990
James is the reason why Clay
went out the door, so if I

02:40.990 --> 02:46.990
win head of household, James
will be the ultimate target.

02:46.990 --> 02:49.990
>> Good job.

02:49.990 --> 02:53.990
>> If I can't play in this
hoh comp I need Becky,

02:53.990 --> 02:55.990
Jackie or Meg to win.

02:55.990 --> 02:58.990
Those are my three girls a
ride or die w I definitely

02:58.990 --> 03:00.540
don't want Shelli to win.

03:00.540 --> 03:05.830
I just sent her man home and
hell have no furry like a

03:05.830 --> 03:09.990
woman scorned.

03:09.990 --> 03:10.990
>> Oh.

03:10.990 --> 03:11.990
>> Shoot.

03:11.990 --> 03:14.950
Oh, that sucks.

03:14.950 --> 03:17.830
>> After Clay went out this
week, we are down to five

03:17.830 --> 03:20.990
players, I feel like a
possible target is Jackie,

03:20.990 --> 03:22.990
Meg or Becky.

03:22.990 --> 03:24.990
And I'm scared of that.

03:24.990 --> 03:27.990
>> Come on, Meg.

03:27.990 --> 03:29.990
>> Steve, you're being smart
about it.

03:29.990 --> 03:31.000
>> Thank you.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.410
>> It's fisks.

03:32.410 --> 03:34.950
The only person I don't want
to win this head of house

03:34.950 --> 03:35.990
hold competition is Becky.

03:35.990 --> 03:37.990
Becky and I haven't made a
particularly good connection

03:37.990 --> 03:42.990
in this game and I feel that
I'm going to be her target

03:42.990 --> 03:47.990
because she sees me as a
tlelt.

03:47.990 --> 03:48.830
-- Threat.

03:48.830 --> 03:49.990
>> I'm sorry.

03:49.990 --> 03:52.990
>> Now that America's
sweethearts are split up, me

03:52.990 --> 03:55.990
and Julia are very
vulnerable right to you

03:55.990 --> 04:02.990
because we're the last power
duo and I'm scared.

04:02.990 --> 04:03.990
>> Ah.

04:03.990 --> 04:05.990
>> That hurt me.

04:05.990 --> 04:08.990
>> It's hard.

04:08.990 --> 04:11.990
>> Going downhill on this
thing, it's a little tricky

04:11.990 --> 04:15.990
cuz you risk sometimes go a
little too fast and you wipe

04:15.990 --> 04:21.990
out.

04:21.990 --> 04:23.990
>> The hardest part about
this competition is coming

04:23.990 --> 04:25.000
back up this ramp.

04:25.000 --> 04:25.990
This is difficult.

04:25.990 --> 04:26.990
I can't get any traction.

04:26.990 --> 04:32.990
I feel lake I'm a baby
gazelle on ice.

04:32.990 --> 04:34.990
>> Oh, Austin, are you all
right?

04:34.990 --> 04:36.990
>> Yeah.

04:36.990 --> 04:37.990
>> You all right?

04:37.990 --> 04:40.990
>> I'm looking over and I
see Liz falling and I'm

04:40.990 --> 04:50.990
hoping that she is falling
as hard for me.

04:50.990 --> 04:54.990
>> Looks like Becky is in
the fast Lane.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.990
>> Becky is feisty right
now.

04:56.990 --> 04:59.830
>> I feel as though I've
been under the radar.

04:59.830 --> 05:02.120
I want to make a big move
and a lot of people know I'm

05:02.120 --> 05:05.990
here to play and I want to
win this hoh.

05:05.990 --> 05:08.990
>> Julia, you're killing it,
girl.

05:08.990 --> 05:11.990
>> Looks like Becky is in
the lead with Julia close

05:11.990 --> 05:12.990
behind.

05:12.990 --> 05:14.990
>> I have to hear James on
the sideline.

05:14.990 --> 05:16.990
Cheering on everybody except
for me.

05:16.990 --> 05:18.990
I just have to tune him out.

05:18.990 --> 05:20.990
It's so annoying an all it
is do something making me

05:20.990 --> 05:24.990
want to win this and put him
up on the block even more.

05:24.990 --> 05:27.540
>> Meg, I think I saw a
turtle pass you.

05:27.540 --> 05:28.990
>> Shut up, jamesie.

05:28.990 --> 05:31.990
Remember how I told you I
was going to be bad at this.

05:31.990 --> 05:33.290
I'm actually worse than I
thought.

05:33.290 --> 05:34.990
He don't know how that's
possible.

05:34.990 --> 05:36.950
>> Come on, grandma.

05:36.950 --> 05:39.990
>> I seem to be the grandma
in the carpool Lane that you

05:39.990 --> 05:41.990
can't pass in this
competition.

05:41.990 --> 05:46.120
I got to pump the brakes cuz
I feel like I'm losing

05:46.120 --> 05:46.990
control.

05:46.990 --> 05:48.990
>> Meggetts her third cup.

05:48.990 --> 05:50.290
>> Yes.

05:50.290 --> 05:51.990
>> I can't stand you!

05:51.990 --> 05:54.990
>> Meg looks like an
80-year-old that just had

05:54.990 --> 05:57.120
hip surgery and does not
want to fall.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.990
>> Come on, grandma.

05:58.990 --> 06:01.120
>> Meg, you're going to win
this comp.

06:01.120 --> 06:04.990
>> Totally winning.

06:04.990 --> 06:05.990
>> If everybody quits.

06:05.990 --> 06:07.990
>> Time to get your rear in
gear!

06:07.990 --> 06:08.990
>> Right.

06:08.990 --> 06:11.990
>> All right, girls.

06:11.990 --> 06:15.290
Girl power in this house,
man.

06:15.290 --> 06:15.990
>> James.

06:15.990 --> 06:19.990
>> Hey, I need you guys to
step it up.

06:19.990 --> 06:21.990
>> That incline, though.

06:21.990 --> 06:25.990
>> This hoh is the most
important hoh for me yet

06:25.990 --> 06:28.990
because a couple hours
earlier I just went from

06:28.990 --> 06:32.290
going under the radar, being
a floater to being one of

06:32.290 --> 06:43.990
the biggest targets in the
house.

06:43.990 --> 06:45.990
>> I agree, man, I agree.

06:45.990 --> 06:48.990
I mean my personal thing I
don't think it's fair for

06:48.990 --> 06:51.990
somebody to give their game
up just because of love.

06:51.990 --> 06:52.990
>> I hear you.

06:52.990 --> 07:01.990
He's not thinking straight.

07:01.990 --> 07:14.990
>> Yeah.

07:14.990 --> 07:17.990
>> You want my word to send
you home, I'll do that but

07:17.990 --> 07:21.990
it's not the best thing for
my game for you to go.

07:21.990 --> 07:22.990
>> Why?

07:22.990 --> 07:27.990
>> Because I feel like
Vanessa is in Shelli's head.

07:27.990 --> 07:29.120
>> I've been observing
Vanessa.

07:29.120 --> 07:32.990
And I see that every times
there's a blowup she's

07:32.990 --> 07:33.990
involved with it.

07:33.990 --> 07:43.990
I'm on to her and I want to
put a stop to it.

07:43.990 --> 07:45.990
>> Vanessa has been on my
side for a while now.

07:45.990 --> 07:47.990
And I feel loyaltiy to her.

07:47.990 --> 07:52.700
So I felt the need to make
sure that she talked to

07:52.700 --> 07:54.410
Johnnie mack an clear the
air and make sure everything

07:54.410 --> 07:56.990
is good on their side.

07:56.990 --> 07:59.990
>> You might want to talk to
Johnnie mack.

07:59.990 --> 08:03.990
>> Telling him that-- you're
in Shelli's head and you are

08:03.990 --> 08:09.990
gos on the --
>> talking to junie mack.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.950
>> James is telling Johnnie
mack.

08:12.950 --> 08:13.990
>> What?

08:13.990 --> 08:23.990
>> Just let him know.

08:23.990 --> 08:26.120
>> Hey James, can I talk to
you alone for a second.

08:26.120 --> 08:27.000
>> Yeah.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.990
>> Do you have something
against me personally?

08:28.990 --> 08:28.990
>> No.

08:28.990 --> 08:29.990
>> Okay.

08:29.990 --> 08:32.290
Cuz it's gotten back to me
that you are throwing my

08:32.290 --> 08:33.990
name out there and I really
don't know why.

08:33.990 --> 08:35.990
Like I said how I was going
to vote.

08:35.990 --> 08:38.990
I could honestly care less
which one goes home.

08:38.990 --> 08:41.990
I am just doing this because
Clay asked me to.

08:41.990 --> 08:42.990
Do you have a problem with
that?

08:42.990 --> 08:44.950
>> No, I don't.

08:44.950 --> 08:46.990
I just told everybody a
minute ago that that was the

08:46.990 --> 08:48.990
whole objective to split
them up.

08:48.990 --> 08:50.830
>> That is what I thought it
was.

08:50.830 --> 08:51.990
>> Yeah.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.990
>> Then why would you tell
johniest mack I'm in

08:54.990 --> 08:57.990
Shelli's head and he needs
to put her out because of

08:57.990 --> 08:58.990
something like me.

08:58.990 --> 09:00.990
>> I didn't, I swear, I on
pie little girl I didn't.

09:00.990 --> 09:03.000
>> So you didn't just go
tell Johnnie mack.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.990
>> No, I did not.

09:04.990 --> 09:05.830
>> What?

09:05.830 --> 09:06.990
Who the is lying here.

09:06.990 --> 09:08.990
>> I haven't lied to you
about anything.

09:08.990 --> 09:11.990
And I swear to God I would
not put that on my little

09:11.990 --> 09:11.990
girl.

09:11.990 --> 09:13.120
>> I know you wouldn't.

09:13.120 --> 09:16.990
>> We need to get to the bot
shall did -- bottom because

09:16.990 --> 09:18.990
I with like to confront
thatness Clay toll me that.

09:18.990 --> 09:20.990
Clay told me that
generalliest mack told me

09:20.990 --> 09:21.700
that.

09:21.700 --> 09:23.990
>> It pisses me off.

09:23.990 --> 09:26.410
>> It pisses me out.

09:26.410 --> 09:28.990
>> I'm to the going to call
your name out but I am just

09:28.990 --> 09:31.410
going to tell Clay to keep
my name out of his mouth.

09:31.410 --> 09:33.990
>> You know what, it's time
to confront the big bad

09:33.990 --> 09:34.990
wolf.

09:34.990 --> 09:36.990
I didn't want this to happen
but it's got to go down.

09:36.990 --> 09:39.990
Because my name is drug in
the dirt, I have a big

09:39.990 --> 09:42.540
target on my back and I
don't need any more of this

09:42.540 --> 09:43.830
stuff.

09:43.830 --> 09:44.990
>> Clay, I don't know how
much time you have left in

09:44.990 --> 09:46.950
this house but I advise you
to keep your name out of my

09:46.950 --> 09:46.990
mouth.

09:46.990 --> 09:47.830
>> Shut up.

09:47.830 --> 09:49.830
>> You shut up.

09:49.830 --> 09:52.990
>> I don't know what you are
talking about.

09:52.990 --> 09:54.990
>> You couldward-- cow ard.

09:54.990 --> 09:56.990
>> Is can I speak to you.

09:56.990 --> 10:01.290
>> Uh-huh.

10:01.290 --> 10:04.990
>> Did James tell you that I
am gunning for you?

10:04.990 --> 10:05.990
>> No.

10:05.990 --> 10:07.990
>> He didn't.

10:07.990 --> 10:08.830
>> No.

10:08.830 --> 10:09.990
>> Stressing about nothing,
all right?

10:09.990 --> 10:12.120
Cuz unlike you, I'm ready to
goes.

10:12.120 --> 10:13.120
>> Oh, you are?

10:13.120 --> 10:13.990
>> Yeah, yeah.

10:13.990 --> 10:15.990
>> All right.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.990
>> But unlike you I don't
have to freaking lie.

10:17.990 --> 10:18.990
>> Ohing really?

10:18.990 --> 10:21.990
>> Yeah, really.

10:21.990 --> 10:22.990
>> Get away from me, dude.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.990
>> You going to hit me or
something.

10:24.990 --> 10:27.990
>> Come on.

10:27.990 --> 10:29.990
>> You going to hit me or
something.

10:29.990 --> 10:32.990
>> I am telling you right
now, don't play me like that

10:32.990 --> 10:33.540
again.

10:33.540 --> 10:36.990
>> Get out of my face.

10:36.990 --> 10:40.990
>> Don't come at me like
that again, you think I'm

10:40.990 --> 10:41.830
clying-- lying.

10:41.830 --> 10:42.990
>> You're out the door next
week.

10:42.990 --> 10:43.410
>> I done care.

10:43.410 --> 10:43.990
>> Calm down.

10:43.990 --> 10:46.120
>> All this freaking lying.

10:46.120 --> 10:46.990
>> You are right, I have
been lying?

10:46.990 --> 10:47.990
>>.

10:47.990 --> 10:48.990
>> Yeah, putting my name in
people's mouth.

10:48.990 --> 10:50.540
>> I don't have time for
you.

10:50.540 --> 10:52.990
>> Okay, it's real easy to
figure out.

10:52.990 --> 10:53.990
Johnnie said James didn't
say that.

10:53.990 --> 10:55.120
>> Say what.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.000
>> Okay, you told me that
Johnnie told you that James

10:57.000 --> 11:01.290
came to him and said Vanessa
is in Shelli's ear and

11:01.290 --> 11:02.990
they're both gunning for
you.

11:02.990 --> 11:05.990
>> No, I said that you are
in Shelli's head.

11:05.990 --> 11:06.990
>> Rit.

11:06.990 --> 11:07.990
>> And that we're gunning
for johniest mack.

11:07.990 --> 11:09.990
>> No, that are you going to
target him, yes.

11:09.990 --> 11:11.290
>> And who told you that.

11:11.290 --> 11:11.990
>> I came up with that.

11:11.990 --> 11:13.990
>> You came up with that.

11:13.990 --> 11:14.990
>> Yeah.

11:14.990 --> 11:15.990
>> It sounds like it came
from you, Clay, and if you

11:15.990 --> 11:18.990
think you will one up me on
this one, I had your back a

11:18.990 --> 11:22.000
million percent, let me tell
you how not cool this is I

11:22.000 --> 11:23.990
can see through you.

11:23.990 --> 11:24.990
>> Vanessa, Vanessa.

11:24.990 --> 11:26.540
>> Was it Clay who said it.

11:26.540 --> 11:27.830
>> I said it.

11:27.830 --> 11:29.990
>> You actually think I'm
gunning for you and I'm in

11:29.990 --> 11:30.990
Shelli's head.

11:30.990 --> 11:31.990
>> Yes.

11:31.990 --> 11:32.990
>> Based on what.

11:32.990 --> 11:34.410
>> The yeah things are
coming together in my head

11:34.410 --> 11:36.990
because nobody tells me
information around here.

11:36.990 --> 11:38.990
>> You both know you didn't
come up with that on your

11:38.990 --> 11:39.990
own.

11:39.990 --> 11:40.990
>> It's not possible.

11:40.990 --> 11:42.990
>> I did.

11:42.990 --> 11:42.990
>> It's not possible.

11:42.990 --> 11:43.990
I done believe it.

11:43.990 --> 11:46.990
>> And what did you come up
with that it came from

11:46.990 --> 11:47.120
James.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.990
>> Maybe I assumed, I don't
know.

11:48.990 --> 11:50.990
>> You think you're lying.

11:50.990 --> 11:51.990
>> Then I'm lying.

11:51.990 --> 11:53.990
>> It seems like you're
lying.

11:53.990 --> 11:55.700
>> Then I'm lying.

11:55.700 --> 11:56.990
>> Why would you do this.

11:56.990 --> 11:57.990
>> I never lied to you.

11:57.990 --> 11:59.410
>> Like why, I don't
understand.

11:59.410 --> 12:00.700
>> I don't know.

12:00.700 --> 12:02.990
>> I don't understand he's
lying, he's lying, I'm

12:02.990 --> 12:04.990
telling it you, he's lying
and I don't know why.

12:04.990 --> 12:06.990
Why would you do this.

12:06.990 --> 12:09.990
>> I'm in the lying I am not
going to explain myself, I

12:09.990 --> 12:10.540
told you the truth.

12:10.540 --> 12:11.830
>> Clay.

12:11.830 --> 12:13.990
>> I'm not going to plead
that I'm in the lying when

12:13.990 --> 12:14.990
I'm not.

12:14.990 --> 12:16.990
>> I'm so honestly confused.

12:16.990 --> 12:20.990
>> Here comes Vanessa,
raised voice and

12:20.990 --> 12:23.700
waterfalling down her face
like here we go again.

12:23.700 --> 12:26.540
This is nothing new this is
like the sixth time this has

12:26.540 --> 12:28.990
happened.

12:28.990 --> 12:31.950
>> Like, what the-- why?

12:31.950 --> 12:32.990
>> What just happened?

12:32.990 --> 12:36.290
>> Clay came to me and said
that James told Johnnie mack

12:36.290 --> 12:38.990
that I'm in your ear and
we're both gunning for

12:38.990 --> 12:39.990
Johnnie.

12:39.990 --> 12:42.990
>> That me and you are jun
-- gunning for John.

12:42.990 --> 12:43.990
>> Correct.

12:43.990 --> 12:44.990
Clay wouldn't make that up
because Clay would not make

12:44.990 --> 12:45.990
that up.

12:45.990 --> 12:46.990
>> But Clay said it to me.

12:46.990 --> 12:49.990
>> I have no earthly idea
what this whole thing is

12:49.990 --> 12:52.290
about an why I was dragged
into it.

12:52.290 --> 12:53.990
>> What I think really is
happening I think Clay must

12:53.990 --> 12:56.990
have said it to Johnnie and
Johnnie is backing Clay up

12:56.990 --> 12:58.990
and saying he made it up in
his own head.

12:58.990 --> 13:03.990
>> I have been playing with
you for 50 days, you done do

13:03.990 --> 13:04.990
things for no reason that
makes no sense.

13:04.990 --> 13:08.990
Are you not insane, why
would you just leaf me in

13:08.990 --> 13:09.990
left field if it's not you.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.990
>> They're if the going
toive go you the answer you

13:11.990 --> 13:14.990
want.

13:14.990 --> 13:16.990
She is looking for more when
there's nothing more.

13:16.990 --> 13:19.990
>> I know what the more is,
Clay.

13:19.990 --> 13:21.950
I know exactly why you did
it.

13:21.950 --> 13:24.830
And if you think I'm to the
going to put the truth out

13:24.830 --> 13:25.990
there, then dude, you're
wrong.

13:25.990 --> 13:26.990
>> Okay.

13:26.990 --> 13:29.990
>> You're the lovers or
related.

13:29.990 --> 13:41.990
That doesn't make any sense
to me.

13:41.990 --> 13:45.990
>>> I toll van easea to come
to you-- Vanessa to come to

13:45.990 --> 13:46.990
you and make sure you all
were good.

13:46.990 --> 13:49.120
I didn't know she would go
back and tell James and

13:49.120 --> 13:49.990
freak out.

13:49.990 --> 13:51.990
>> Because James did not
tell me that.

13:51.990 --> 13:52.990
>> You toll me that right
there.

13:52.990 --> 13:57.120
>> No, I said I did it,.

13:57.120 --> 14:00.410
>> I-- you said this Vanessa
was in her head.

14:00.410 --> 14:01.990
>> That's what it seemed
like.

14:01.990 --> 14:03.700
>> You assumed that.

14:03.700 --> 14:03.990
>> Yeah.

14:03.990 --> 14:05.120
>> You said you told James
that.

14:05.120 --> 14:10.950
>> No, I didn't tell James
anything.

14:10.950 --> 14:12.120
>> This is a huge
misunderstanding.

14:12.120 --> 14:14.990
>> This is a very
smart-- Vanessa is a smart

14:14.990 --> 14:16.990
player but she is a loose
canon.

14:16.990 --> 14:19.990
Her emotions can go from
zero to 80 in like less than

14:19.990 --> 14:21.990
a second.

14:21.990 --> 14:23.990
>> Do you think Vanessa
could ever make me turn

14:23.990 --> 14:24.990
away.

14:24.990 --> 14:26.990
>> She's good.

14:26.990 --> 14:29.410
>> After you were nominated
she threw your names under

14:29.410 --> 14:31.990
the bus.

14:31.990 --> 14:35.990
She did this, crying bull
that she does every time.

14:35.990 --> 14:37.000
>> She's too emotional.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.990
>> Exactly.

14:41.990 --> 14:47.990
She sent Audrey home, an
jayson home, sending you

14:47.990 --> 14:49.120
home.

14:49.120 --> 14:52.990
>> Shelli, she's good.

14:52.990 --> 14:59.290
None of this is-- she is
going to take out Austin to

14:59.290 --> 15:01.990
save herself, every time.

15:01.990 --> 15:09.990
>> Proceed with caution.

15:09.990 --> 15:12.990
>> I need to win hoh this
week to make sure I'm safe

15:12.990 --> 15:16.990
from the block and to make
sure Vanessa goes home.

15:16.990 --> 15:19.290
>> Approaching the halfway
mark, Becky still in the

15:19.290 --> 15:19.990
lead.

15:19.990 --> 15:22.000
Close behind, Jackie and
Shelli.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.990
>> Last week was a rough
one.

15:23.990 --> 15:26.990
I was up on the block next
to my number one Ally in

15:26.990 --> 15:27.990
this house.

15:27.990 --> 15:28.990
But I'm still here.

15:28.990 --> 15:31.700
I'm out for revenge, I'm out
for blood.

15:31.700 --> 15:33.990
I have got to do this one

15:44.990 --> 15:47.990
>> approaching the halfway
mark, Becky still in the

15:47.990 --> 15:49.990
lead.

15:49.990 --> 15:50.990
>> Go Becky.

15:50.990 --> 15:52.990
>> Close behind, Julia,
Jackie, John and Shelli.

15:52.990 --> 15:55.540
>> Good work, you guys.

15:55.540 --> 15:59.990
>> Time to rev it up.

15:59.990 --> 16:02.990
>> I just reved it up.

16:02.990 --> 16:05.990
>> Am I hoping that either
Julia or me pulls this one

16:05.990 --> 16:06.990
out.

16:06.990 --> 16:07.990
>> Oh, yikes.

16:07.990 --> 16:09.700
That was ugly.

16:09.700 --> 16:13.990
>> Talk about trashing-- crash
and burn.

16:13.990 --> 16:14.990
>> I'm spilling a lot.

16:14.990 --> 16:22.990
>> I realize there is no way
I'm winning this competition.

16:22.990 --> 16:25.000
>> Trying the running
strategy to you.

16:25.000 --> 16:30.990
>> I'm playing against
Austin who sees who is the

16:30.990 --> 16:31.990
slowest.

16:31.990 --> 16:38.990
>> Oh, God, Austin.

16:38.990 --> 16:41.990
>> Oh, God, are you okay?

16:41.990 --> 16:45.990
>> Austin takes a gnarly
fall.

16:45.990 --> 16:48.990
>> I'm sure glad I'm not
competing in this one.

16:48.990 --> 16:50.990
>> There's five of us going
for this thing right now it

16:50.990 --> 16:57.290
is Becky, Julia, me, Jackie
and Shelli.

16:57.290 --> 17:01.540
Yeah, so I got to make sure
that I'm keeping pace with

17:01.540 --> 17:02.990
everyone else, just in case
they got hit by lightning or

17:02.990 --> 17:06.990
something.

17:06.990 --> 17:09.990
>> At this point, I'm out of
the running to win.

17:09.990 --> 17:13.990
So I'm going to be rooting
for my alliance members to

17:13.990 --> 17:14.990
win this thing.

17:14.990 --> 17:17.990
It's been a rough week for
sixth sense.

17:17.990 --> 17:19.990
Hopefully we can turn it
around.

17:19.990 --> 17:24.990
>>> If Shelli wins hoh this
week I'm up the creek

17:24.990 --> 17:26.990
without a paddle.

17:26.990 --> 17:27.990
I'm screwed, I'm done.

17:27.990 --> 17:31.990
>> I wonder how many Miles
we've done on this thing.

17:31.990 --> 17:32.990
>> Oh pie God.

17:32.990 --> 17:33.950
>> Steve in.

17:33.950 --> 17:34.990
>> I don't know.

17:34.990 --> 17:36.990
>> Becky is pulling ahead.

17:36.990 --> 17:39.990
And I'm like oh yeah, girl.

17:39.990 --> 17:41.990
Go Becky go.

17:41.990 --> 17:46.700
>> Becky is on my side and
we both want to get Shelli

17:46.700 --> 17:47.990
out.

17:47.990 --> 17:49.990
>> I'm good.

17:49.990 --> 17:51.990
>> Looks really slippery out
there.

17:51.990 --> 17:54.990
>> Everyone is slipping and
sliding all over the place.

17:54.990 --> 17:57.990
And I look over at Becky and
she's pulling way ahead.

17:57.990 --> 17:59.990
>> The girl gets hit by a
train and she's frigging

17:59.990 --> 18:00.990
superwoman.

18:00.990 --> 18:04.830
>> Becky is pulling forward
in this competition.

18:04.830 --> 18:05.990
But I can't give up yet.

18:05.990 --> 18:07.990
I've got it win this one for
Clay.

18:07.990 --> 18:14.830
>> Becky, you're full.

18:14.830 --> 18:15.990
>> Austin.

18:15.990 --> 18:17.990
>> I'm good.

18:17.990 --> 18:18.990
>> A train can't stop her.

18:18.990 --> 18:20.540
>> No, hell no.

18:20.540 --> 18:23.000
>> You deserve it, girl.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.990
>> It's coming down to the
wire.

18:24.990 --> 18:28.990
>> I look around and notice
that I have a very strong

18:28.990 --> 18:29.990
lead.

18:29.990 --> 18:33.700
I'm going to try to get the
hoh but I kind of want to

18:33.700 --> 18:36.990
try for these other two
prizes first.

18:36.990 --> 18:40.990
>> So I start with the have-not
pass first.

18:40.990 --> 18:42.990
>> And continue up the way.

18:48.120 --> 18:48.990
>> Whooo!

18:48.990 --> 18:50.990
>> Yeah.

18:50.990 --> 18:53.990
>> All right.

18:53.990 --> 18:55.990
>> Woo!

18:55.990 --> 19:09.290
>> Yes, girl.

19:09.290 --> 19:12.990
>> Congratulations, Becky,
you are the new head of

19:12.990 --> 19:13.950
household.

19:13.950 --> 19:16.990
>> Sure enough, this
Colorado girl has won hoh

19:16.990 --> 19:18.990
and on top of that, I will
never be have not and I have

19:18.990 --> 19:22.000
$5,000.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.990
>> Yes, Becky.

19:23.990 --> 19:25.990
>> I'm pretty sure that the
house will be shocked at who

19:25.990 --> 19:27.990
I really want to send home
this week.

19:27.990 --> 19:31.990
I'm ready to take out a big
fish.

19:31.990 --> 19:34.990
>> Becky winning this
competition is absolute

19:34.990 --> 19:35.990
worst-case scenario.

19:35.990 --> 19:39.990
I could total Leigh be her
target because I know she's

19:39.990 --> 19:40.990
threatened by me.

19:40.990 --> 19:43.990
I'm really nervous about
what Becky is going to do.

19:43.990 --> 19:46.990
>> I feel a little bit
nervous that Becky is hoh

19:46.990 --> 19:49.990
simply because when I was in
power, Becky was all about

19:49.990 --> 19:50.990
us.

19:50.990 --> 19:51.700
Then when the enemy got in
power, Becky has been all

19:51.700 --> 19:52.990
about the enemy.

19:52.990 --> 19:54.990
So now that Becky is in
power, which side is she

19:54.990 --> 19:55.990
going to go with?

19:55.990 --> 19:57.990
>> That was impressive, one,
two and three.

20:10.990 --> 20:12.990
>> Oh my goodness.

20:12.990 --> 20:18.540
>> I walked past the pem ree
wall w Clay's face in gray.

20:18.540 --> 20:22.410
I walked back to the purple
room, Clay's stuff is not in

20:22.410 --> 20:22.990
there.

20:22.990 --> 20:24.990
Clay's not laying in the
bed.

20:24.990 --> 20:27.990
I mean, I think about him
for like a split second and

20:27.990 --> 20:29.990
I just can't stop crying.

20:29.990 --> 20:33.990
And now for the first time
in this game, I feel

20:33.990 --> 20:46.990
completely alone.

20:46.990 --> 20:52.950
Now I'm this big huge target
without my main man to fight

20:52.950 --> 20:53.290
with.

20:53.290 --> 20:59.990
This game sucks for me right
now.

20:59.990 --> 21:05.990
>> I just don't know, I
can't stop.

21:05.990 --> 21:06.540
>> Oh!

21:06.540 --> 21:18.290
So annoying.

21:18.290 --> 21:20.990
Recently I was playing both
sides but things are finally

21:20.990 --> 21:25.990
becoming more defined,
Jackie, Meg and James are

21:25.990 --> 21:30.990
just the people I trust more
in the house.

21:30.990 --> 21:37.990
>> Can I just like-- the
perfect-- it is perfect for

21:37.990 --> 21:40.990
me.

21:40.990 --> 21:48.990
Just you'll like it.

21:48.990 --> 21:52.540
>> How are you doing-- is it
hitting you now?

21:52.540 --> 21:56.000
>> I've never been a girl
that cries over a guy.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.700
I don't cry over dudes.

21:58.700 --> 22:01.830
So like this is just been
out of this world.

22:01.830 --> 22:03.990
>> I know, I even cried when
he left.

22:03.990 --> 22:04.990
>> I cried, I teared up.

22:04.990 --> 22:10.990
His face is so adoreable.

22:10.990 --> 22:14.990
>> He was awesome, he cooked
for us.

22:14.990 --> 22:17.990
>> I want to know if the
real world has changed him

22:17.990 --> 22:19.990
or if things are the same.

22:19.990 --> 22:23.990
>> I would have think in
this house or the vir house

22:23.990 --> 22:25.990
they will be the same.

22:25.990 --> 22:29.950
>> I bet his phone will be
blown up with all his

22:29.950 --> 22:30.410
exgirlfriends.

22:30.410 --> 22:31.990
>> Or hopeful new
girlfriends, you know?

22:31.990 --> 22:32.990
>> I know.

22:32.990 --> 22:36.990
>> I mean, whatever.

22:36.990 --> 22:38.990
>> How far is Texas from
Georgia?

22:38.990 --> 22:43.990
>> Probably like a two or
three hour flight.

22:43.990 --> 22:45.830
>> Like Miami to New York or
something.

22:45.830 --> 22:48.990
>> He has never been to new
York so we're going to see

22:48.990 --> 22:49.990
Meg at christmastime.

22:49.990 --> 22:50.990
>> That will be fun.

22:50.990 --> 22:53.700
>> It is so expensive at
christmastime and we would

22:53.700 --> 22:54.990
have a place to stay with
Meg.

22:54.990 --> 23:00.990
>> I know.

23:00.990 --> 23:01.990
>> .

23:01.990 --> 23:04.120
>> Oh pie God, I'm
permanently seeing white?

23:04.120 --> 23:05.410
>> With really?

23:05.410 --> 23:05.990
>> Yeah.

23:05.990 --> 23:10.700
>> You need some water.

23:10.700 --> 23:22.990
>> Yeah.

23:22.990 --> 23:24.990
>> Although I feel confident
that I'm to the going up on

23:24.990 --> 23:28.830
the block or my sis, I'm
kind of worried about

23:28.830 --> 23:31.990
Vanessa because she has put
Becky up on the block

23:31.990 --> 23:32.830
before.

23:32.830 --> 23:33.990
And Becky almost went home
that week.

23:33.990 --> 23:35.990
That's kind of scary to me.

23:35.990 --> 23:45.990
Because she's like the mom
of our alliance.

23:45.990 --> 23:54.990
Because she's like the mom
of our alliance.

23:54.990 --> 23:59.990
>> Don't worry about
anything.

23:59.990 --> 24:01.990
Is she going after Vanessa?

24:01.990 --> 24:04.830
>> I'm going to talk to her
about it.

24:04.830 --> 24:06.990
>> I am so pumped that Becky
won.

24:06.990 --> 24:09.990
We have bonded over being
outsiders in this house

24:09.990 --> 24:10.990
since the beginning.

24:10.990 --> 24:14.990
It's awesome to see a friend
win and it doesn't hurt that

24:14.990 --> 24:15.990
she's pretty hot.

24:15.990 --> 24:18.950
>> I don't have all the
pieces tolling of what

24:18.950 --> 24:19.290
happened.

24:19.290 --> 24:20.990
But Vanessa did not do
anything to you.

24:20.990 --> 24:21.990
>> Correct.

24:21.990 --> 24:23.990
>> It's just that you are
seeing how she's in

24:23.990 --> 24:24.990
everyone's corner.

24:24.990 --> 24:25.990
>> Exactly.

24:25.990 --> 24:28.990
I have seen it since week
two.

24:28.990 --> 24:31.990
>> What is it?

24:31.990 --> 24:34.990
>> How Vanessa operates.

24:34.990 --> 24:36.290
>> Oh.

24:36.290 --> 24:38.990
>> There is this huge fight
that broke out right before

24:38.990 --> 24:41.990
the live eviction and I'm
figuring out that John is

24:41.990 --> 24:43.990
really mad at Vanessa.

24:43.990 --> 24:45.990
I'm nervous because the two
people I'm closest with at

24:45.990 --> 24:47.830
the house are John and
Vanessa.

24:47.830 --> 24:49.290
I'm really not comfortable
with them being at odds with

24:49.290 --> 24:52.990
each other.

24:52.990 --> 24:56.990
>> It's not hard but I'm
going to.

24:56.990 --> 24:59.990
>> You want to take her.

24:59.990 --> 25:00.990
>> No.

25:00.990 --> 25:02.000
>> You have to promise me
something.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.540
>> What?

25:03.540 --> 25:07.410
>> If for some reason we're
in jury an Becky is also in

25:07.410 --> 25:11.990
jury, you have to go for it.

25:11.990 --> 25:12.990
>> She didn't do it?

25:12.990 --> 25:13.990
>> I have no idea.

25:13.990 --> 25:15.990
But in jury, not here.

25:15.990 --> 25:16.990
>> Not here.

25:16.990 --> 25:20.990
>> Game first.

25:20.990 --> 25:22.990
>> Who wants to see my hoh
room!

25:22.990 --> 25:23.990
>> Whooo!

25:23.990 --> 25:24.990
>> Yeah!

25:24.990 --> 25:27.990
>> Yeah!

25:27.990 --> 25:35.950
>> This is the-- hoh room
ever.

25:35.950 --> 25:37.990
>> Whooo!

25:37.990 --> 25:39.990
>> Becky.

25:39.990 --> 25:42.990
>> That's my best friend.

25:42.990 --> 25:49.990
>> Oh, wow.

25:49.990 --> 25:51.990
>> Oh, bough chicka wow wow.

25:51.990 --> 25:54.990
>> Looking at Becky's
picture, I definitely didn't

25:54.990 --> 25:58.990
even notice the dog in the
background, Molly, whatever.

25:58.990 --> 26:02.990
Man, that's a sweet looking
two-piece you got on there,

26:02.990 --> 26:03.000
girl.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.990
>> Oh my God.

26:05.990 --> 26:08.990
Va-va-voom, meyer.

26:08.990 --> 26:10.990
>> Wow, look at that basket.

26:10.990 --> 26:14.990
>> She's got like the
healthiest basket.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.990
>> It is so healthy I can't
even --

26:16.990 --> 26:20.410
>> asparagus and fruit.

26:20.410 --> 26:20.990
>> Kale!

26:20.990 --> 26:23.990
>> Sorry, I'm going to be a
have not.

26:23.990 --> 26:25.990
>> And I got brussel
sprouts.

26:25.990 --> 26:27.000
>> Oh pie goodness.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.540
>> Seriously?

26:28.540 --> 26:32.990
>> You know, she had lettuce
and some kind of balls that

26:32.990 --> 26:34.990
were green and they looked
like tennis balls or

26:34.990 --> 26:37.120
something and she said we
could eat them but I'm not

26:37.120 --> 26:39.990
into that stuff I will be
honest with you right now, I

26:39.990 --> 26:42.990
would rather eat slop than
eat that mess she has in

26:42.990 --> 26:43.990
that basket.

26:43.990 --> 26:46.120
>> Austin, have one.

26:46.120 --> 26:57.990
Without wants one, we have
enough for everyone.

26:57.990 --> 27:02.990
>> Who do you think Becky
would target.

27:02.990 --> 27:09.990
>> Maybe you will be the
boss.

27:09.990 --> 27:11.290
>> You know what, Vanessa?

27:11.290 --> 27:12.990
>> Hmmmm.

27:12.990 --> 27:22.990
>> We ran the show for four
weeks, now it's their turn.

27:22.990 --> 27:25.990
They ran it last week and
they're in there squealing

27:25.990 --> 27:28.990
because Becky's got it.

27:28.990 --> 27:30.990
>> I'm pretty sure she
flipped.

27:30.990 --> 27:33.410
That was pretty obvious.

27:33.410 --> 27:36.000
>> With Becky's hoh, I feel
like I'm at risk.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.990
She is really a wild card,
she's not much of a

27:38.990 --> 27:40.990
strategist or gamer, and
which don't really speak the

27:40.990 --> 27:42.950
same language in this thing.

27:42.950 --> 27:50.990
It makes me nervous.

27:50.990 --> 27:53.990
>> Oh pie God.

27:53.990 --> 28:03.990
>> Is oh pie God, oh pie God,
what gave it away, that it-- oh

28:03.990 --> 28:05.990
my God, what the hell is
that?

28:05.990 --> 28:09.990
>> That just happened.

28:09.990 --> 28:13.990
>> What the hell!

28:13.990 --> 28:15.990
>> Y'all want to hear?

28:15.990 --> 28:18.990
>> Yes.

28:18.990 --> 28:20.990
>> Man, that thing was
technical.

28:20.990 --> 28:21.990
>> Good work.

28:21.990 --> 28:23.990
>> So what are you thinking?

28:23.990 --> 28:30.990
>> So we were all cornered
into the game plan so we're

28:30.990 --> 28:31.990
all going to follow it.

28:31.990 --> 28:35.990
>> Last we can we agreed on
Vanessa plan to go after the

28:35.990 --> 28:36.990
remaining member.

28:36.990 --> 28:37.990
>> Does everyone in this
room have a feeling where

28:37.990 --> 28:38.990
they are voting.

28:38.990 --> 28:40.290
>> I don't think it really
matters if the target is the

28:40.290 --> 28:43.410
other one the following week,
it doesn't matter.

28:43.410 --> 28:45.990
>> However, I have a
different plan in mind.

28:45.990 --> 28:54.990
>> We're going to put up
Shelli and Steve, right?

28:54.990 --> 28:56.990
We say we're sticking with
the plan.

28:56.990 --> 29:02.990
>> But it's not going to be
Shelli, it's going to be

29:02.990 --> 29:04.990
Vanessa.

29:04.990 --> 29:06.990
>> Ooh, yeah, sneaky.

29:06.990 --> 29:07.830
>> Done.

29:07.830 --> 29:08.950
>> Good.

29:08.950 --> 29:10.990
>> You think Shelli's got to
g Shelli's got to go.

29:10.990 --> 29:12.990
She will eat that up like
candy.

29:12.990 --> 29:13.990
>> Like candy.

29:13.990 --> 29:15.990
>> She's pissed enough
people off.

29:15.990 --> 29:16.990
That's why she is so
paranoid.

29:16.990 --> 29:19.990
That is why she is so
stressed is because she has

29:19.990 --> 29:20.990
gone after James.

29:20.990 --> 29:26.990
She has changed her target,
put Jeff and sent Jeff home.

29:26.990 --> 29:30.000
She sent Jason home, she is
all over in this room.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.990
>> Did you even hear the
whole thing.

29:31.990 --> 29:33.700
>> I heard the whole entire
thing.

29:33.700 --> 29:35.990
I was right outside the have
not door.

29:35.990 --> 29:37.990
>> When that took place, all
I need --

29:37.990 --> 29:41.290
>> I honestly feel safer
with Shelli than Vanessa.

29:41.290 --> 29:43.700
>> Even though I know Shelli
will be coming after me, I

29:43.700 --> 29:45.700
really want to get Vanessa
out of this house.

29:45.700 --> 29:48.990
She is a chameleon in the
grass, snake in the grass,

29:48.990 --> 29:49.990
Vanessa you've got to go.

29:49.990 --> 29:51.990
>> But this is the deal.

29:51.990 --> 29:52.990
I need, need, need this from
you.

29:52.990 --> 29:54.990
We do not say the v word.

29:54.990 --> 29:56.410
>> No, never.

29:56.410 --> 29:57.700
>> Never.

29:57.700 --> 29:59.990
>> Even to one another in
the bedrooms, in the

29:59.990 --> 30:00.990
bathrooms.

30:00.990 --> 30:04.990
From now until the pov
meeting, we are in a plan,

30:04.990 --> 30:07.000
or she will catch on am she
will smell blood in the

30:07.000 --> 30:07.990
water.

30:07.990 --> 30:08.990
Like we mood to stick with
this.

30:08.990 --> 30:11.990
We need to be in charge and
not let anybody change or

30:11.990 --> 30:13.120
flip anything at the end.

30:13.120 --> 30:16.990
That's what they want within
that is the perfect reason

30:16.990 --> 30:20.990
why I'm the good one to take
her out because I'm just

30:20.990 --> 30:25.290
like-- like I work black
Friday, I know how to deal

30:25.290 --> 30:27.290
with Vanessa.

30:55.990 --> 30:58.990
>> Johnny Mac, how are you
doing, are you okay over

30:58.990 --> 30:59.000
there?

30:59.000 --> 31:00.950
>> Yeahing I'm okay.

31:00.950 --> 31:01.990
>> Where is Steve?

31:01.990 --> 31:08.990
>> What are you doing?

31:08.990 --> 31:13.990
>> It's a good place to get
away.

31:13.990 --> 31:16.990
>> I space out a lot in my
daily life, it's something I

31:16.990 --> 31:17.990
do.

31:17.990 --> 31:19.990
My head just goes so many
different directions and my

31:19.990 --> 31:24.990
brain and body become
completely detached.

31:24.990 --> 31:27.990
>> I'll go around dancing.

31:27.990 --> 31:29.990
I talk to myself.

31:29.990 --> 31:34.990
>> This reminded me of a
story that my dad told me.

31:34.990 --> 31:35.990
Oh, okay.

31:35.990 --> 31:39.000
>> I do some strange things
that even I don't completely

31:39.000 --> 31:40.990
understand in this house.

31:40.990 --> 31:42.990
>> I'm just a very strange
person.

31:42.990 --> 31:48.000
I think that's what it
ultimately boils down to.

31:48.000 --> 31:55.990
Not sure what this is.

31:55.990 --> 32:02.990
I'm okay with it cuz I like
who I am.

32:02.990 --> 32:05.700
>> Steve, stop that.

32:05.700 --> 32:08.990
>> In hindsight that was
actually a pretty terrible

32:08.990 --> 32:11.990
idea.

32:11.990 --> 32:17.990
>> I do not know why I just
put a-- in there.

32:17.990 --> 32:19.990
>> Come on in.

32:19.990 --> 32:21.990
>> How are you?

32:21.990 --> 32:30.950
>> Obviously last week was
really-- so I need you, I

32:30.950 --> 32:31.990
need anyone --
>> okay.

32:31.990 --> 32:34.000
>> And I want to foe where
we are.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.990
>> Probably better than you
are thinking it is?

32:35.990 --> 32:36.990
>> Really.

32:36.990 --> 32:39.000
>> That's a relief.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.990
Witness.

32:40.990 --> 32:43.990
>> Somebody made themselves
a bigger target than you.

32:43.990 --> 32:48.540
>> I told Meg and James and
Jackie that I would not say

32:48.540 --> 32:51.990
the name.

32:51.990 --> 32:53.990
>> How do you feel about
that.

32:53.990 --> 32:56.540
>> I told my group that I
wasn't going to let anyone

32:56.540 --> 32:58.990
else know about the back
door plan.

32:58.990 --> 33:01.990
By telling Shelli my bigger
target in mind, I feel it

33:01.990 --> 33:04.950
gains a lot of trust and she
will hopefully return that

33:04.950 --> 33:05.990
gesture in the future to me.

33:05.990 --> 33:09.000
>> This is hard for me
because I do care for her.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.990
Because I know that she
stood up for me.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.700
So I'm not going to throw
her under the bus.

33:14.700 --> 33:16.990
>> It took nothing for her
to throw you under.

33:16.990 --> 33:17.990
Nothing.

33:17.990 --> 33:20.990
We've all in this house
rotated through one of

33:20.990 --> 33:22.990
Vanessa's groups at some
point.

33:22.990 --> 33:24.990
And we have also been left
out at some point.

33:24.990 --> 33:27.120
As long as it is have essa
safe, that is what is

33:27.120 --> 33:28.700
important.

33:28.700 --> 33:29.990
>> Vanessa is another person
in this house that I played

33:29.990 --> 33:32.000
a game with, and that I was
going to keep working with.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.990
New that Vanessa is in this
position, there's really not

33:35.990 --> 33:38.990
a whole lot I can do to save
her.

33:38.990 --> 33:42.990
>> She needs to be a back
door because she's good but

33:42.990 --> 33:44.990
back doors don't always
work.

33:44.990 --> 33:48.990
>> Work.

33:48.990 --> 33:52.990
>> It would be-- a lot of
things are rougher El and it

33:52.990 --> 33:55.990
makes complete sense, James
got rid of Clay, Becky is in

33:55.990 --> 33:58.990
the group, Becky will finish
it off it makes perfect

33:58.990 --> 33:59.410
sense.

33:59.410 --> 34:02.990
So she needs to think that
it's you.

34:02.990 --> 34:05.990
>> I want to send home
Vanessa but if for any

34:05.990 --> 34:09.410
reason that nominations stay
the home, I think

34:09.410 --> 34:10.990
the-- think the house will
send home Shelli.

34:10.990 --> 34:13.990
I'm just hoping the machine
stays the way it is.

34:13.990 --> 34:18.990
>> Meg, James, me and Jackie
would pull you off and put

34:18.990 --> 34:20.830
her next to Steve.

34:20.830 --> 34:21.830
>> Okay.

34:21.830 --> 34:23.990
>> But you have to be pissed
at me.

34:23.990 --> 34:25.290
>> I will be.

34:25.290 --> 34:30.990
Because --
>> start crying.

34:30.990 --> 34:35.540
>> I can't cry unless I'm
really thinking it, but no,

34:35.540 --> 34:36.990
I will go lay down or
something.

34:36.990 --> 34:38.540
>> I feed some sleep.

34:38.540 --> 34:39.990
>> I'm so relieved.

34:39.990 --> 34:43.990
>> Okay.

34:43.990 --> 34:49.990
>> Pie face on the block
tomorrow --

34:49.990 --> 34:53.290
>> yeah, the slots are you,
oh pie God.

34:53.290 --> 34:55.990
>> I'm to the going to
interrupt you, however, it

34:55.990 --> 34:58.830
is rapidly approaching my
bedtime.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.990
>> No, we were just --
>> we were talking about

35:00.990 --> 35:02.990
have nots.

35:02.990 --> 35:02.990
>> Okay.

35:02.990 --> 35:04.990
>> Nothing complicated.

35:04.990 --> 35:07.830
Plan staying the samement it
makes more sense tore me to

35:07.830 --> 35:10.990
put Shelli up next to Steve.

35:10.990 --> 35:15.540
And if one of them wins the
veto, we put Johnnie mack

35:15.540 --> 35:16.700
up.

35:16.700 --> 35:18.950
Do you have a primary
purpose in terms of target s

35:18.950 --> 35:19.990
it still Shelli.

35:19.990 --> 35:22.950
>> I believe that she is
like best intentions person

35:22.950 --> 35:27.830
but nonetheless, like last
week got dirty.

35:27.830 --> 35:27.990
>> Dirty.

35:27.990 --> 35:30.990
>> In so many.

35:30.990 --> 35:32.290
>> I know what you mean.

35:32.290 --> 35:33.990
>> I think we are similar to
you.

35:33.990 --> 35:36.000
>> With that being said, I
won't take up too much of

35:36.000 --> 35:37.990
your guy's time.

35:37.990 --> 35:38.990
>> We're done here.

35:38.990 --> 35:39.990
We already had our talk.

35:39.990 --> 35:47.830
Thank you, Becky.

35:47.830 --> 35:50.120
>> I just wanted to let you
know, with Clay an Shelli

35:50.120 --> 35:52.990
being on their way out n
terms of this, we have been

35:52.990 --> 35:53.990
good.

35:53.990 --> 35:54.990
I have had two hohs.

35:54.990 --> 35:55.990
You have had two.

35:55.990 --> 35:58.830
Obviously you know how good
I am for my wore.

35:58.830 --> 36:00.990
When we make a deal I will
get blood on my hands.

36:00.990 --> 36:03.830
I will do whatever it takes
to keep my word.

36:03.830 --> 36:04.830
>> Yeah.

36:04.830 --> 36:05.950
>> In deals that I make.

36:05.950 --> 36:09.990
So the reason I'm bringing
that up is that like I'm

36:09.990 --> 36:12.990
very isolated at this point
in the game.

36:12.990 --> 36:15.410
And I would feel to make
some kind of deal

36:15.410 --> 36:19.990
individually, you and I,
what I can offer in

36:19.990 --> 36:22.990
return --
>> done with deals and

36:22.990 --> 36:25.990
alliancesment I don't even
want to hear those words

36:25.990 --> 36:26.540
again in my life.

36:26.540 --> 36:27.000
>> Oh, really?

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
>> I can see right through
Vanessa.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.290
And I'm done with her.

36:30.290 --> 36:32.990
I cannot stand her style of
game play.

36:32.990 --> 36:35.540
Her word means nothing to me
at this point.

36:35.540 --> 36:37.990
I can't stand any more of
it.

36:37.990 --> 36:39.540
>> It is not my style.

36:39.540 --> 36:40.990
I'm like organic.

36:40.990 --> 36:43.990
And if it's going with it,
it's going with it.

36:43.990 --> 36:47.990
>> I like those, like,
short-term here's an action

36:47.990 --> 36:47.990
plan.

36:47.990 --> 36:48.990
>> Uh-huh.

36:48.990 --> 36:55.990
>> But the, like, deals,
alliances, whatever, I'm

36:55.990 --> 36:56.990
like, no.

36:56.990 --> 36:57.990
>> You don't like it.

36:57.990 --> 36:58.990
>> No.

36:58.990 --> 37:01.990
>> Gotcha.

37:01.990 --> 37:02.990
>> Okay.

37:02.990 --> 37:03.990
>> I'm basic Becky.

37:03.990 --> 37:10.990
>> Do you mind not telling
Shelli that I know.

37:10.990 --> 37:11.990
>> That's fine.

37:11.990 --> 37:14.990
>> Sounds good.

37:14.990 --> 37:16.990
I will let you be and I will
hit the hey.

37:16.990 --> 37:19.990
>> Does Becky even know the
word "Big Brother".

37:19.990 --> 37:21.990
She doesn't want to talk
about deals, like what?

37:21.990 --> 37:24.540
>> I don't like Becky's game,
I don't at all.

37:24.540 --> 37:26.990
I don't see her as being a
game player.

37:26.990 --> 37:29.120
She is more-- of the week.

37:29.120 --> 37:30.990
Strategically my head is
spin, she is unwilling to

37:30.990 --> 37:34.990
make that deal with me which
indicates very lickly I'm a

37:34.990 --> 37:35.990
target of hers in some
fashion.

37:35.990 --> 37:37.700
Oh my God, this is terrible.

37:37.700 --> 37:39.990
It's just terrible.

37:39.990 --> 37:41.990
-- Terrible.

38:02.990 --> 38:03.990
>> Oh yeah.

38:03.990 --> 38:06.990
Yeah.

38:06.990 --> 38:09.990
>> What I say to you, nobody
knows, so please, whatever I

38:09.990 --> 38:12.990
tell you, pretend you
doningt even knows what's

38:12.990 --> 38:13.540
going on.

38:13.540 --> 38:14.990
I'm just going to tell you.

38:14.990 --> 38:21.990
Shut your mouth, and-- so I
am going to put up Shelli an

38:21.990 --> 38:25.990
Steve.

38:25.990 --> 38:26.990
But neither will be going
home.

38:26.990 --> 38:31.990
The only part that you,
Jackie, Meg and James know,

38:31.990 --> 38:34.990
the replacement is Vanessa.

38:34.990 --> 38:35.990
That's right.

38:35.990 --> 38:36.990
Vanessa.

38:36.990 --> 38:41.830
>> Since week one I have had
a problem.

38:41.830 --> 38:42.990
>> She's the --
>> this is the best thing

38:42.990 --> 38:44.120
that could have happened!

38:44.120 --> 38:47.000
Like we're going to actually
be calling the shots for

38:47.000 --> 38:47.990
once.

38:47.990 --> 38:49.990
We're getting our target out
this week.

38:49.990 --> 38:57.540
Basically, we can't fail
this is amazing.

38:57.540 --> 39:00.990
>> Becky, I am so good on my
word, I've shown it, so good

39:00.990 --> 39:02.290
on my word.

39:02.290 --> 39:06.990
I'm like your word, your
word is-- is-- you have no

39:06.990 --> 39:07.990
idea.

39:07.990 --> 39:09.990
You are with nobody in this
game.

39:09.990 --> 39:12.990
You are independent because
you have betrayed so many

39:12.990 --> 39:14.000
people.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.990
You changed your targets,
you foiled people's game.

39:15.990 --> 39:18.990
And the whole time you run
around saying everyone is

39:18.990 --> 39:20.990
after you and how stressed
you are.

39:20.990 --> 39:24.120
You are stressed because you
do it to yourself.

39:24.120 --> 39:27.990
>> She's just really smart,
Audrey.

39:27.990 --> 39:32.410
>> No, she's smart and dumb
at the same time.

39:32.410 --> 39:36.700
>> But her, the twins,
Austin, you think you are

39:36.700 --> 39:39.410
the back door and I think
the twins and Austin will

39:39.410 --> 39:41.120
be-- okay to see Vanessa get
back doored.

39:41.120 --> 39:42.410
>> Very good.

39:42.410 --> 39:44.120
>> Vanessa has to go home
and has no clue that the

39:44.120 --> 39:44.990
house is after her.

39:44.990 --> 39:45.990
>> Ready?

39:45.990 --> 39:46.990
>> Yeah.

39:46.990 --> 39:55.990
>> So don't talk to me, like
you are a a scum bag.

39:55.990 --> 39:57.990
>> Butch.

39:57.990 --> 40:05.290
>> .

40:05.290 --> 40:07.990
>> Within hey, everybody,
time for the nomination

40:07.990 --> 40:17.990
ceremony.

40:17.990 --> 40:24.990
Ceremony.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.540
>> This is the nomination
ceremony.

40:26.540 --> 40:29.990
It is my responsibility as
the head of household to

40:29.990 --> 40:32.990
nominate two house guests
for eviction.

40:32.990 --> 40:36.990
I will turn two keys to lock
in my nomination and their

40:36.990 --> 40:38.990
faces will appear on the
memory wall.

40:38.990 --> 40:50.990
The first house guest that I
have nominated is: The next

40:50.990 --> 41:00.990
house guest I have nominated
is: I have nominated you,

41:00.990 --> 41:07.120
house guest I have nominated
is: I have nominated you,

41:07.120 --> 41:12.990
Shelli, and you Steve,
Shelli, it is so hard to put

41:12.990 --> 41:17.990
you on this block because we
lost someone very close to

41:17.990 --> 41:20.990
you last week and we had to
watch that and it tore our

41:20.990 --> 41:21.990
hearts out.

41:21.990 --> 41:24.990
But last week a lot of
things came out and the

41:24.990 --> 41:28.990
moment Clay walked out that
door, there were fights

41:28.990 --> 41:29.990
breaking out it was one of
the hardest weeks in this

41:29.990 --> 41:30.990
house.

41:30.990 --> 41:31.990
And I condition let that go.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.990
Steve, you are the biggest
"Big Brother" fan ever.

41:33.990 --> 41:36.990
And I want to see you get
your hands dirty.

41:36.990 --> 41:38.990
Get into the social game.

41:38.990 --> 41:40.990
Throw a target out there.

41:40.990 --> 41:44.990
Win a comp, get a little
dirty in that pov this week.

41:44.990 --> 41:50.990
This nomination ceremony is
adjourned.

41:50.990 --> 41:52.990
>> Becky has told me that
I'm not a target this week

41:52.990 --> 41:54.990
and that I should be feeling
pretty good.

41:54.990 --> 41:57.000
But this is "Big Brother",
things can change on a dime.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.410
So the only way that I can
insurance my safety this

41:59.410 --> 42:03.540
week is to get out there and
win that power of veto.

42:03.540 --> 42:05.990
>> I don't need to be going
to the jury house right now.

42:05.990 --> 42:10.990
Clay's not there waiting on
me.

42:10.990 --> 42:13.000
When I see Shelli an Steve's
faces on the nomination

42:13.000 --> 42:14.990
block, it's complicated for
me.

42:14.990 --> 42:17.290
On the one hand it means
Becky is sticking to the

42:17.290 --> 42:19.990
plan so far which means
maybe I will be okay after

42:19.990 --> 42:20.990
all.

42:20.990 --> 42:24.000
On its other hand I'm eared
I could end up on the block

42:24.000 --> 42:25.990
at some point this week.

42:25.990 --> 42:29.290
>> Vanessa has had some hand
in every one of these

42:29.290 --> 42:31.990
evictions and she has
absolutely no blood to show

42:31.990 --> 42:32.990
for you it.

42:32.990 --> 42:37.830
So it's about time that she
gets what is coming to her.

42:37.830 --> 42:39.990
>> Yes, Becky, I'm aware I'm
a superfan.

42:39.990 --> 42:42.990
Yes, Becky I'm aware I'm
laying superlow.

42:42.990 --> 42:46.120
Yes, Becky, I am aware I
have no blood on my hands

42:46.120 --> 42:47.120
this is all intentional.

42:47.120 --> 42:48.290
Thank you for pointing this
out.

42:48.290 --> 42:51.990
And now that are advertising
you are aware of this,

42:51.990 --> 42:52.990
you're my next target.

42:52.990 --> 42:54.990
>> Who will win the power of
veto.

42:54.990 --> 42:58.290
And will it be used to save
either Steve or Shelli from

42:58.290 --> 42:59.540
eviction?
