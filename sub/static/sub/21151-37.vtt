OFF THE BLOCK THEN I'M THE ONLY

06:54.915 --> 06:58.151
OPTION TO GO BACK UP AND KEVIN
GETS TO MAKE THE DECISION OF WHO

06:58.185 --> 07:01.154
GETS TO GO HOME, EITHER ME OR
JOSH.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.924
THIS CAN ABSOLUTELY RUIN
EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE WORKED SO

Julie: HOUSEGUESTS WE HAVE A

12:04.024 --> 12:04.624
TIE.

12:04.657 --> 12:05.358
>> OH YEAH, PLAY DUMB, ALEX.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.694
>> I HAVE TO VOTE TO EVICT
JASON.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.697
Julie: JASON, YOU ARE HE VICED
FROM THE BIG BROTHER HOUSE.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.399
>> I THOUGHT I COULD TRUST ALEX.

12:12.432 --> 12:16.436
SHE KNEW THIS WAS COMING SO I
DON'T WANT HER TO WIN NOW.

12:16.469 --> 12:20.373
>> IT WASN'T ME, NO, NO, IT
WASN'T ME, JASON.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.041
>> JASON.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.275
>> BULL ROAR YOU DIDN'T DO IT.

12:22.309 --> 12:24.711
THERE IS NOTHING GOES ON IN THAT
HOUSE THAT THOSE TWO DONE KNOW

12:24.744 --> 12:26.013
ABOUT.

12:26.046 --> 12:31.484
>> I LIKE-- LIKED THE EXIT.

12:31.518 --> 12:36.323
>> I SHOULD HAVE WALKED ACROSS
THE DAMN TABLE.

12:36.356 --> 12:40.327
Julie: UP NEXT, JASON LEARNS
THE TRUTH WHEN RAVEN AND ALEX

12:40.360 --> 12:41.461
JOIN THE JURY.

12:41.494 --> 12:45.398
THEN THE FINAL MOST POWERFUL
VETO OF THE SUMMER IS UP FOR

12:45.432 --> 12:46.433
GRABS.

12:46.466 --> 12:49.202
WHO WILL JOIN PAUL AS A MEMBER
OF THE FINAL THREE.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.238
STAY WITH US.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.093
Julie: WELCOME BACK TO BIG
BROTHER.

13:13.126 --> 13:16.363
WHEN THEY ENTER THE JURY HOUSE
EVERY JUROR BRINGS WITH THEM

13:16.396 --> 13:21.001
THEIR UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON HOW
THEY PLAYED THE GAME.

13:21.034 --> 13:26.974
SOME MORE SURPRISING THAN OTHERS
>> SO YOU ARE THE LAST ONE OUT

13:27.007 --> 13:30.077
AND YOU LEFT IN THE MIDDLE OF A
DOUBLE EVICTION, WHO DO YOU

13:30.110 --> 13:32.645
THINK OUR NEXT ROOMMATE IS.

13:32.679 --> 13:35.815
>> PAUL AND I WILL BE COMPETING
FURIOUSLY SO KEVIN AND RAVEN

13:35.849 --> 13:38.585
HAVE GOT A PRETTY GOOD SHOT OF
WALKING THROUGH THAT DOOR.

13:38.618 --> 13:40.820
>> I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT WANT TO
SEE RAVEN.

13:40.854 --> 13:43.556
AND I WOULD ALSO NOT LIKE TO SEE
PAUL EITHER.

13:43.590 --> 13:46.626
THE LONGER PAUL LASTS IN THE
GAME THE BETTER CHANCE RAVEN HAS

13:46.659 --> 13:48.261
OF MAKING IT TO THE FINAL THREE.

13:48.295 --> 13:52.365
>> WHY IS IT QUIET, Y'ALL NEED
SOME.

13:52.399 --> 13:53.766
>> WHAT'S UP, BABE.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.602
>> HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

13:55.635 --> 13:56.536
>> OH MY GOSH.

13:56.569 --> 13:57.404
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:57.437 --> 13:59.406
>> I DON'T KNOW.

13:59.439 --> 14:02.943
>> GOING OUT SECOND IN THE
DOUBLE EVICTION-- DOUBLE

14:02.976 --> 14:05.345
EVICTION WASN'T THAT MUCH FUN, I
WAS MR HURT THAN SHOCKED.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.915
I THOUGHT CHRISTMAS AND JOSH HAD
MY BECOME AND REALLY WANTED TO

14:07.948 --> 14:09.816
GO TO FINAL FOUR WITH PAUL AND
I.

14:09.849 --> 14:10.650
BUT I GUESS NOT.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.352
>> SO WHY ARE YOU HERE, WHAT
HAPPENED.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.787
>> WILL YOU HAVE TO COME WATCH
AND FIND OUT.

14:14.821 --> 14:17.824
Julie: HOUSEGUESTS, THE POWER
IS UP FOR GRABS.

14:17.857 --> 14:21.194
>> I REALLY WANT TO WIN THIS HOH
CUZ I KNEW IF I DIDN'T WIN I WAS

14:21.228 --> 14:23.130
GOING TO GO ON THE BLOCK.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.697
Julie: CONGRATULATIONS, ALEX.

14:24.731 --> 14:29.436
>> THAT'S FOR YOU, JASON, THAT
IS FOR YOU, JASON.

14:29.469 --> 14:32.339
Julie: ARE YOU THE NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD, ALEX.

14:32.372 --> 14:36.576
>> WHAT?

14:36.609 --> 14:37.344
>> SHE DIDN'T KNOW.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.311
>> SHE SAID THAT'S FOR YOU,
JASON.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.013
>> SO RAVEN, TELL ME, WHO VOTED
TO GET ME OUT.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.414
I'M COMPLETELY CONFUSED.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.850
DID PAUL AND ALEX KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT IT?

14:43.883 --> 14:45.318
>> ALEX HAD NO IDEA.

14:45.352 --> 14:46.586
SHE WAS BLIND SIDED.

14:46.619 --> 14:50.323
PAUL KNEW, CHRISTMAS KNEW, JOSH
KNEW, I KNEW.

14:50.357 --> 14:55.028
>> SHE WAS LOYAL TO YOU, FROM
THE GET-GO.

14:55.062 --> 15:01.801
SHE WAS SO UPSET WHEN YOU LEFT
AND YOU DID NOT GIVE HER A HUG.

15:01.834 --> 15:04.037
>> I-- FEEL RIDICULOUS NOW THAT
I EVEN THOUGHT SHE HAD ANYTHING

15:04.071 --> 15:05.305
TO DO WITH IT.

15:05.338 --> 15:08.675
BECAUSE I HONESTLY WAS JUST SURE
THAT SHE WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE

15:08.708 --> 15:11.911
BEEN IN ON IT BECAUSE SHE IS SO
SMART AT THE GAME.

15:11.945 --> 15:14.481
I GOT A BIG GIANT LUMP IN MY
THROAT.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.749
I DANG NEAR SHED A COUPLE OF
TEARS.

15:16.783 --> 15:19.586
I WAS PRETTY HARD ON HER WHEN I
GOT EVICTED.

15:19.619 --> 15:22.422
>> DID ALEX FIND OUT, I GUESS,
THAT PAUL WAS IN ON THE PLAN.

15:22.455 --> 15:25.725
>> SHE HAS NO IDEA.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.895
Julie: ALEX,S AHEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD, IT IS NOW TIME TO

15:28.928 --> 15:30.330
MAKE YOUR NOMINATION.

15:30.363 --> 15:35.535
>> I'M SORRY, KEVIN, I'M SORRY.

15:35.568 --> 15:38.038
>> PUT PAUL UP.

15:38.071 --> 15:40.107
>> ACTUALLY, I WANT PAUL TO GO
TO THE END.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.709
>> WHY DO YOU WANT PAUL TO GO TO
THE END?

15:42.742 --> 15:45.778
>> CUZ I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH
PAUL THE ENTIRE TIME.

15:45.812 --> 15:47.780
PAUL HAS BEEN WORKING WITH
EVERYONE THE ENTIRE TIME.

15:47.814 --> 15:51.018
>> NO, MATT AND I AND PAUL, WE
HAD AN ALLIANCE TOGETHER.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.286
>> WE HAD THE SAME ALLIANCE.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.122
>> WE KNEW ABOUT EVERYONE'S
ALLIANCE.

15:55.155 --> 15:58.058
BUT THE ONE PAUL REALLY CARED
ABOUT WAS MATT AND MYSELF.

15:58.091 --> 16:02.629
>> WHY ARE YOU TWO SITTING HERE
THEN?

16:02.662 --> 16:06.499
>> THEY SENT ALEX -- I THINK
THEY FIGURED OUT IT WAS ME AND

16:06.533 --> 16:07.767
PAUL.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.803
MAYBE NOT PAUL BUT I WAS PULLING
SOME STRINGS BECAUSE I KNEW WHAT

16:10.837 --> 16:14.574
WAS GOING ON.

16:14.607 --> 16:21.248
>> THIS IS HILARIOUS.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.850
>> REALLY GOT AHOLD OF THAT ONE,
DIDN'T YOU BUD.

16:23.883 --> 16:25.018
>> HERE ALL WEEK.

16:25.052 --> 16:27.487
>> SO WHO DO WE THINK OUR NEW
ROOMMATE IS.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.956
>> I HOPE IT'S NOT ALEX.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.259
>> HONESTLY, I'M STILL LIKE
SUPERCONFUSED ABOUT THE WHOLE

16:32.292 --> 16:34.161
ALEX THING.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.629
ON ONE HAND I DO IF THE WANT TO
SEE HER COME IN HERE AT ALL.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.865
I DON'T WANT TO SEE ALEX.

16:38.898 --> 16:41.868
ON THE OTHER HAND IF I DID SEE
ALEX THEN I WOULD KNOW THAT IT

16:41.901 --> 16:42.935
WASN'T HER AT ALL.

16:42.969 --> 16:46.573
>> I MEAN SHE WAS THE LAST HOH
SO SHE CAN'T COMPETE.

16:46.606 --> 16:51.644
AND IF PAUL IS BEING TRUE TO
PAUL, I AM SURE HE WILL TAKE A

16:51.678 --> 16:54.714
SHOT AT HIS LAST ALLIANCE
MEMBER.

16:54.747 --> 16:59.619
>> NEVER FEAR, THE-- WOMAN IS
HERE TO DISTRIBUTE WEINER WOMAN

16:59.652 --> 17:02.622
IS HERE TO DISTRIBUTE JUSTICE
ONE HOT DOG AT A TIME.

17:02.655 --> 17:08.761
SO I KNOW-- .

17:08.795 --> 17:10.997
>> ALEX, HON, WHY ARE YOU
WEARING THAT COSTUME.

17:11.030 --> 17:14.201
>> WELL, YOU GUYS MISSED ON BB
COMICS WEEK.

17:14.234 --> 17:15.068
LET'S WATCH.

17:15.102 --> 17:17.737
>> ONCE AGAIN THE POWER IS UP
FOR GRAB.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.939
>> ESSENTIALLY THEY WANTED JOSH
TO WIN BECAUSE THEY WANTED HIM

17:19.972 --> 17:20.873
TO TAKE THAT SHOT.

17:20.907 --> 17:23.343
>> HE'S GOING TO GET SECOND
PLACE.

17:23.376 --> 17:30.049
>> BB COMICS IS ABOUT TO RELEASE
16 NEW SUPERHEROES.

17:30.083 --> 17:30.417
>> YES.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.619
SO ACCURATE.

17:32.652 --> 17:35.822
>> IT WASN'T A PUPPET MASTER.

17:35.855 --> 17:38.658
>> ALEX, I'M SORRY THAT I LET
YOU DOWN THIS WEEK.

17:38.691 --> 17:42.195
BUT I CHOOSE NOT TO USE THE
POWER OF VETO.

17:42.229 --> 17:45.632
>> I LITERALLY TOLD PAUL THAT HE
IS MY ONE SHOT AT THIS GAME AND

17:45.665 --> 17:47.334
HE DOES NOT CARE.

17:47.367 --> 17:50.670
HE PULLED ME INTO A ROOM AND HE
SAID IF I BRING YOU TO THE FINAL

17:50.703 --> 17:54.707
TWO I FOR SURE WILL LOSE.

17:54.741 --> 17:55.808
YOU CAN PULL ME OFF, HE SAID I
CAN'T RUIN MY JURY VOTE.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.844
>> WE'LL SHOW YOU YOUR JURY
VOTES, PAL.

17:57.877 --> 17:59.179
>> I'M PISSED.

17:59.212 --> 18:07.954
>> I WANTED TO SEE-- I'M SORRY,
I FEEL JASON, SORRY DUDE, SORRY.

18:07.987 --> 18:11.324
>> NO, IT'S PAUL, I WISH I COULD
TAKE BACK ALL THE FEELINGS THAT

18:11.358 --> 18:13.193
I HAD AGAINST YOU WHEN I WAS
WALKING OUT THAT DOOR.

18:13.226 --> 18:16.329
>> I KNEW THAT YOU HAD THEM AND
I KNEW IT WAS SUPERSKETCHY AND

18:16.363 --> 18:17.497
HE WANTED THAT.

18:17.530 --> 18:20.867
>> TODAY I FOUND OUT ALEX WAS
100% NOT A PART OF MY BLIND

18:20.900 --> 18:24.036
SIDE, THAT'S WHY I FEEL PRETTY
BAD ABOUT EVEN THINKING AND NOT

18:24.070 --> 18:25.305
HUGGING HER ON THE WAY OUT.

18:25.338 --> 18:28.775
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, ALEX GOT
EVICTED THE SAME REASON I GOT

18:28.808 --> 18:29.976
EVICTED.

18:30.009 --> 18:32.379
BECAUSE WE COULDN'T TRUST OUR
THIRD LEG IN THE PARTNERSHIP.

18:32.412 --> 18:35.815
>> YOU CAN'T VOTE FOR THAT MAN.

18:35.848 --> 18:36.549
>> IT'S THE GAME.

18:36.583 --> 18:37.016
>> YEAH.

18:37.049 --> 18:38.151
>> OH MY GOD.

18:38.185 --> 18:42.054
>> IT IS THE GAME, I AGREE WITH
YOU, ALEX, 100 PERCENT.

18:42.088 --> 18:45.057
>> OH, I JUST WANT TO SAY, JUST
SO WE CAN ADDRESS THIS REAL

18:45.091 --> 18:48.295
QUICK, THEETION TWO CLAIM TO BE
THE PUPPET MASTERS.

18:48.328 --> 18:52.799
>> YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN HAVING FUN
HERE WITHOUT ME.

18:52.832 --> 18:53.833
YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO THE OTHER
HOUSE.

18:53.866 --> 18:56.002
>> WE WOULD BE HAVING FUN IT
WASN'T FOR THESE TWO.

18:56.035 --> 18:59.306
>> WHAT THE-- DID MATT AND I DO
TO YOU IN THE GAME.

18:59.339 --> 19:00.873
I WANT TO KNOW THAT, JASON.

19:00.907 --> 19:01.674
WHAT DID WE DO?

19:01.708 --> 19:03.876
WE WERE IN OUR OWN LITTLE WORLD.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.144
>> YEAH.

19:05.178 --> 19:06.946
>> YEAH, IGNORING YOUR ASS.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.014
>> THANK GOD.

19:08.047 --> 19:09.949
>> SO WHAT DID WE DO TO NEW THAT
HOUSE.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.150
I WANT TO KNOW.

19:11.184 --> 19:14.153
>> I NEVER HEARD SOMEBODY SAY
THEY WERE A PUPPET MASTER AND

19:14.187 --> 19:14.987
WIN NOTHING.

19:15.021 --> 19:18.625
>> WHAT DID YOU WIN BESIDES-- ON
JOSH.

19:18.658 --> 19:23.129
>> I DIDN'T PLAY-- .

19:23.162 --> 19:25.432
>> YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY YOU ARE
HERE, ALL DID YOU WAS PLAY WITH

19:25.465 --> 19:26.799
EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE.

19:26.833 --> 19:31.338
>> YOU DIDDING IF BUT PLAY HOUSE
IN THE BIG BROTHER HOUSE.

19:31.371 --> 19:34.807
>> WHOA, I WAS PLAYING A I
SOULFUL GAME.

19:34.841 --> 19:37.244
>> YOU PLAYED WITH MY MIND.

19:37.277 --> 19:43.082
>> WHY ARE YOU SUCH A-- THAT IS
PROBABLY YOUR MIDDLE NAME.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.150
>> OKAY.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.553
>> I JUST DON'T, LIKE YOU SAY
PUPPET MASTER LIKE YOU

19:46.586 --> 19:50.523
CONTRIBUTED TO THE GAME AND THIS
BOTHERS ME AS A COMPETITOR AND

19:50.557 --> 19:52.124
BIG BROTHER FAN.

19:52.158 --> 19:54.527
>> I WAS HELPING PAUL PULL
STRINGS.

19:54.561 --> 19:55.595
>> EVERYBODY WAS.

19:55.628 --> 19:56.429
>> YES.

19:56.463 --> 19:57.630
>> I DIDN'T.

19:57.664 --> 20:03.135
>> YEAH, DUDE, YEAH, OKAY.

20:03.169 --> 20:07.240
Julie: UP NEXT IT IS THE FINAL

21:53.546 --> 21:56.583

21:56.616 --> 22:00.052
BECAUSE IF HE DOES, IT BASICALLY
SEALS MINE OR CHRISTMAS' FATE IN

22:00.086 --> 22:02.021
THIS GIM AND WE'RE SCREWED.

>> JOSH IS A GOOD KID, PLAYED A
DIFFERENT STYLE OF GAME, HE

22:24.677 --> 22:25.612
CRITICIZES OTHER PEOPLE'S GAMES.

I THINK IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO GO.

22:33.453 --> 22:34.921
MYSELF ARE GOING TO GO HOME.

22:34.954 --> 22:40.126
THERE IS NO WAY THAT ANY OF US
ARE GOING TO LET KEVIN TAKE

22:40.159 --> 22:41.127
THIS.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.195
>> PLAYERS, IT IS TIME FOR YOUR
FIRST TIME JUMP.

22:43.229 --> 22:44.664
ROUND ONE.

22:44.697 --> 22:55.307
ON WHAT DAY DID JASON RECEIVE
HIS EXTREMEI TZ DAR.

22:55.341 --> 23:02.081
>> LIKELY FOR THIS FIRST ONE I
CAN'T FORGET BEING IN THE

23:02.114 --> 23:13.626
EXTRIMITON ON DAY 53.

23:13.660 --> 23:17.263
>> I KNOW THIS IS FROM THE BB
ADVENTURE VETO COMPETITION BUT I

23:17.296 --> 23:18.498
CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT I
DA.

23:18.531 --> 23:21.100
I'M JUST PRAYING THAT KEVIN IS
STRUGGLING WITH THIS TOO BECAUSE

23:21.133 --> 23:31.143
HE CANNOT WIN THIS VETO.

23:31.177 --> 23:36.516
HE CANNOT WIN THIS VETO.

23:36.549 --> 23:39.952
>> SORRY, YOU FINISHED LAST AND
YOUR TIME MACHINE HAS LOST POWER

23:39.986 --> 23:41.454
FOR THE FIRS TIME.

23:41.488 --> 23:45.658
TWO MORE MISCALCULATIONS AND YOU
WILL BE OUT OF THE COMPETITION.

23:45.692 --> 23:46.392
>> NOT A GOOD START.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.060
I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT.

23:48.094 --> 23:52.632
CHRISTMAS, THIS IS YOUR ONE TIME
TO-- BUT LET'S PULL IT TOGETHER

23:52.665 --> 23:55.668
BECAUSE KEVIN CANNOT WIN.

23:55.702 --> 24:00.807
>> ROUND TWO, ON WHAT DAY DID
CAMERON FIRST APPEAR ON THE

24:00.840 --> 24:04.977
MEMORY WALL IN INKED AND
EVICTED.

24:05.011 --> 24:10.983
>> OH MY GOD.

24:11.017 --> 24:13.820
>> SO THE NEXT QUESTION IS WHEN
WAS THE FIRST DAY CAMERON WAS ON

24:13.853 --> 24:14.787
THE MEMORY WALL.

24:14.821 --> 24:18.457
I THOUGHT HE WAS NEVER UP THERE.

24:18.491 --> 24:19.926
>> WAS HE ON THE MEMORY WALL?

24:19.959 --> 24:26.265
I DON'T REMEMBER HIM EVER BEING
ON THE WALL.

24:26.298 --> 24:36.308
>> I REMEMBER THIS DAY PERFECTLY
IT WAS DAY 36.

24:36.342 --> 24:47.353
>> I REMEMBER THIS DAY PERFECTLY
IT WAS DAY 36.

24:47.386 --> 24:48.187
>> SORRY, KEVIN.

24:48.220 --> 24:49.856
YOU FINISHED LAST.

24:49.889 --> 24:54.293
TWO MORE MISCALCULATIONS AND YOU
WILL BE OUT OF THE COMPETITION.

24:54.326 --> 24:57.329
>> BOOM, KEVIN LAWSES A ROUND,
CHRISTMAS IS BACK IN THE GAME.

24:57.363 --> 25:00.600
WE CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE KEVIN
WIN THIS VETO.

25:00.633 --> 25:02.434
KEEP UP THE PRESSURE, EVERYBODY.

25:02.468 --> 25:03.269
>> ROUND THREE.

25:03.302 --> 25:06.939
ON WHAT DAY WAS THE HALTING HEX
USED.

25:06.973 --> 25:17.784
>> JULIE, I AM OFFICIALLY
UNLEASHING THE HALTING HEX.

25:17.817 --> 25:20.620
>> NOBODY WANTED SWRES KA TO USE
THIS HEX, ESPECIALLY ME, IT WAS

25:20.653 --> 25:31.197
DAY 44.

25:31.230 --> 25:34.100
>> SECOND MALFUNCTION IN A ROW,
I'M IN BIG TROUBLE HERE.

25:34.133 --> 25:35.301
>> THAT WAS QUICK.

25:35.334 --> 25:37.704
I WANT TO WIN THIS VETO BUT AT
THE SAME TIME I TRUST PAUL, WE

25:37.737 --> 25:41.040
MADE IT THIS FAR AND HE'S MY
PARTNER SO WE WILL SEE WHAT

25:41.073 --> 25:41.741
HAPPENED.

25:41.774 --> 25:42.374
>> SORRY, KEVIN.

25:42.408 --> 25:48.214
YOU FINISHED LAST.

25:48.247 --> 25:50.249
ONE MORE MISCALCULATION AND YOU
WILL BE OUT OF THE COMPETITION.

25:50.282 --> 25:55.955
>> KEVIN HAS TRUE-- COME ON,
KEVY, ALL I NEED TO YOU DO IS

25:55.988 --> 25:58.324
MESS UP ONE MORE TIME AND SCREW
THIS ALL UP FOR YOURSELF.

25:58.357 --> 26:09.001
>> ROUND FOUR, ON WHAT DAY DID
RAVEN WIN A NEVER NOT PASS?

26:09.035 --> 26:12.571
>> THE FOURTH QUESTION IS WHEN
RAVEN HAD THE HAVE NOT PASS.

26:12.605 --> 26:15.608
LET'S SEE, I WASN'T THE HOST OF
THAT.

26:15.642 --> 26:19.078
I WAS THE MERMAN, WHATEVER.

26:19.111 --> 26:21.614
I'M THINKING IT HAPPENED AROUND
WEEK THREE SO I WILL START THERE

26:21.648 --> 26:27.954
AND MOVE MY WAY UP AND SEE.

26:27.987 --> 26:31.323
>> BEFORE I EVEN GET A CHANCE TO
ADJUST MY ANSWER THE WHOLE POV

26:31.357 --> 26:32.524
GOES BOOM, UP IN SMOKE.

26:32.558 --> 26:36.095
I JUST DON'T THINK I WANT JOSH
TO WIN THE VETO BECAUSE HE'LL

26:36.128 --> 26:39.632
TAKE HIMSELF OFF SO IF PAUL CAN
WIN THE VETO I'LL BE A LITTLE

26:39.666 --> 26:42.802
HAPPIER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

26:42.835 --> 26:46.605
>> IF KEVIN'S OUT OF THE
COMPETITION, YOU PAID YOURSELF.

26:46.639 --> 26:50.042
NOW ALL I GOT TO DO IS WIN THE
VETO AND SECURE MY SPOT IN TOP

26:50.076 --> 26:51.177
THREE.

26:51.210 --> 26:54.146
>> SORRY, KEVIN, YOUR TIME
MACHINE IS NOW INOPERABLE AND

26:54.180 --> 26:57.116
YOU ARE ELIMINATED FROM THE
GAME.

26:57.149 --> 27:00.152
>> KEVIN IS OUT BUT I STILL HAVE
WORK TO DO I HAVE TO WIN THIS

27:00.186 --> 27:03.455
VETO SO I HAVE FULL CONTROL THIS
WEEK AND GET IN BLOOD ON MY

27:03.489 --> 27:05.391
HANDS WHEN IT IS TIME TO EVICT
HIM.

27:05.424 --> 27:10.262
>> ROUND FIVE, ON WHAT DAY DID
MARK WIN HIS FIRST VETO

27:10.296 --> 27:12.164
COMPETITION?

27:12.198 --> 27:13.165
>> CONGRATULATIONS, MARK.

27:13.199 --> 27:20.439
YOU HAVE WON THE POWER OF VETO.

27:20.472 --> 27:28.748
>> I REMEMBER THAT, IT WAS DAY
46 WHEN THAT MEATBALL TOOK THAT

27:28.781 --> 27:35.688
ONE.

27:35.722 --> 27:38.825
>> SORRY, CHRISTMAS, YOU
FINISHED LAST AND YOUR TIME

27:38.858 --> 27:41.127
MACHINE HAS LOST POWER FOR A
SECOND TIME.

27:41.160 --> 27:45.965
ONE MORE MISCALCULATION AND YOU
WILL BE OUT OF THE COMPETITION.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.266
ROUND SIX.

27:47.299 --> 27:51.237
ON WHAT DAY DID YOU WATCH THE
REVENGERS TRAILER?

27:51.270 --> 27:58.044
>> I SEE YOU BROUGHT SOME
FRIENDS.

27:58.077 --> 28:01.413
>> I THINK I KNOW THIS ONE
BECAUSE BB COMICS IS USUALLY A

28:01.447 --> 28:05.584
VETO AND THE VETTEDO HAPPENED ON
DAY 81.

28:05.617 --> 28:06.252
BOOM.

28:06.285 --> 28:07.453
ALL RIGHT SO IT WASN'T DAY 81.

28:07.486 --> 28:10.556
WHICH MEANS IT MUST HAVE BEEN
THE DAY BEFORE, BECAUSE IT WAS

28:10.589 --> 28:11.323
AT NIGHT TIME.

28:11.357 --> 28:17.029
THEN IT MUST BE DAY 80.

28:17.063 --> 28:19.398
BOOM.

28:19.431 --> 28:22.268
ALL RIGHT, IT TOTALLY WASN'T DAY
80.

28:22.301 --> 28:25.504
SO I BLEW IT BIG TIME AND I'M
JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AND

28:25.537 --> 28:30.276
ASSUME IT WAS DAY 79, BECAUSE
THAT'S WHEN WE PLAYED THE HOH,

28:30.309 --> 28:32.745
DAY 79.

28:32.779 --> 28:33.512
BOOM.

28:33.545 --> 28:39.285
JUST LIKE I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT
WAS.

28:39.318 --> 28:45.724
>> SORRY, CHRISTMAS, YOU ARE
ELIMINATED FROM THE GAME.

28:45.758 --> 28:51.063
>> JOSH AND PAUL HAVE-- THE
WORST-CASE SCENARIO FOR ME IS

28:51.097 --> 28:54.066
JOSH WINS THE VETO AND TAKES
HIMSELF OFF THE BLOCK.

28:54.100 --> 28:57.103
IF JOSH SA SAFE IT GOES ME
AGAINST CHRISTMAS AND WHO WANTS

28:57.136 --> 28:58.170
TO HE VIC CHRISTMAS.

28:58.204 --> 29:01.373
I SHOULD HAVE COME IN WITH A
NAME LIKE THANKSGIVING.

29:01.407 --> 29:04.643
THEY CAN'T THROW YOU OUT FOR
THANKSGIVING.

29:04.676 --> 29:08.514
>> ON WHAT DAY DID YOU GET
ZINGED BY ZINGPOT?

29:08.547 --> 29:13.485
>> WHAT'S UP, LOSSERS?

29:13.519 --> 29:17.489
>> ZING BOT, HOW COULD I FORGETR
ZING BOT, HE REMINDED ME THAT I

29:17.523 --> 29:27.533
LOST HALF A MILLION DOLLARS, AND
THAT HAPPENED ON DAY SIX.

29:27.566 --> 29:34.907
LOST HALF A MILLION DOLLARS, AND
THAT HAPPENED ON DAY SIX.

29:34.941 --> 29:37.109
>> SORRY, JOSH, YOU FINISHED
LAST.

29:37.143 --> 29:41.113
YOUR TIME MACHINE HAS LOST POWER
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

29:41.147 --> 29:43.983
>> JOSH HAS ONE MISCALCULATION
ALREADY AND HE'S GOT TWO MORE

29:44.016 --> 29:45.818
LEFT BEFORE I WIN THIS VETO.

29:45.852 --> 29:48.554
SO I DEFINITELY NEED TO PUSH
THROUGH, FINISH THE REST OF THIS

29:48.587 --> 29:52.825
GAME SO I CAN KEEP NOM
NATION-- NOMINATIONS THE SAME

29:52.859 --> 29:54.026
AND HAVE FULL CONTROL OF THIS
WEEK.

29:54.060 --> 29:59.565

29:59.598 --> 30:05.037
TIME-SHARE TYRANT.

30:05.071 --> 30:08.040
>> I WASN'T A HUGE FAN OF MY
COMIC BUT I WAS A BIG FAN OF

30:08.074 --> 30:19.618
WINNING THAT VETO AND I KNOW IT
HAPPENED ON DAY 81.

30:19.651 --> 30:22.454
>> SORRY, JOSH, YOU FINISHED
LAST.

30:22.488 --> 30:26.392
ONE MORE MISCALCULATION AND YOU
WILL BE OUT OF THE COMPETITION.

30:26.425 --> 30:30.329
>> THIS SUCKS, I LOVE AND
TRUSTED MY ALLIES BUT WHEN

30:30.362 --> 30:33.265
YOU'RE ON THE BLOCK, YOU WIN THE
VETO AND YOU GET YOURSELF OFF,

30:33.299 --> 30:35.034

TO PAVE THE PATH TO THE END OF
THIS GAME AND HOPEFULLY STRAIGHT

31:16.675 --> 31:18.310

>> PAUL WINS THE VETO AND I'M
EXCITED BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN

31:23.582 --> 31:24.917
PLAYING GAD ALL SUMMER.

31:24.951 --> 31:27.186
I FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH IT
BECAUSE I HAVE A BETTER CHANCE

31:27.219 --> 31:30.656
OF STAYING IN THE GAME AND JOSH
LEAVING.

31:30.689 --> 31:40.032
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

31:40.066 --> 31:42.534

31:57.950 --> 31:59.118
>> YEAH.

31:59.151 --> 32:01.087
>> EVEN THOUGH I FEEL BAD I'M
JUST GOING TO TELL HIM WHAT HE

32:01.120 --> 32:04.290
WANTS TO HEAR SO I DON'T GET ANY
BLOOD ON MY HANDS AND HOPEFULLY

32:04.323 --> 32:06.692
I LOCK UP ANOTHER JURY VOTE WITH
KEVIN.

32:06.725 --> 32:10.963
>> LET'S SAY IT COMES DOWN TO
YOU AND ME, YOU-- LISTEN, LET'S

32:10.997 --> 32:15.267
BE HONEST F I COME IN SECOND,

32:27.279 --> 32:32.451
>> WELL, I'M TELLING YOU, IF I

32:32.484 --> 32:33.652
PUT OUT.

32:33.685 --> 32:34.853
>> SHE'S VERY SMART.

32:34.886 --> 32:36.722
>> I'M THE VETO HOLDER AND I
CONTROL EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS.

32:36.755 --> 32:39.225
I MADE IT THIS FAR LAST YEAR.

32:39.258 --> 32:41.260
AND I FELL ONE VOTE SHORT OF
WINNING THE GAME.

32:41.293 --> 32:45.364
SO I REALLY GOT TO THINK OF ALL
MY OPTIONS, ALL POSSIBILITIES TO

32:45.397 --> 32:47.066
ENSURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN
AGAIN.

32:47.099 --> 32:50.136
I CAN'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE
TWICE.

32:50.169 --> 32:52.904
>> CHRISTMAS WOULD BEAT YOU,

35:25.090 --> 35:28.927
PAUL AS THE WINNER OF THE POWER
OF VETO, YOU MAY USE IT TO SAVE

35:28.960 --> 35:32.831
JOSH OR KEVIN OR CHOOSE TO LEAVE
YOUR NOMINATIONS IN PLACE.

35:32.864 --> 35:37.169
SO PLEASE STAND AT THE FRONT OF
THE LIVING ROOM AND GIVE US ALL

35:37.203 --> 35:42.508
YOUR DECISIONS.

35:42.541 --> 35:45.110
>> HOUSEGUESTS, AS YOU KNOW,
WE'VE ALL HAD TO FACE EXTREMELY

35:45.143 --> 35:46.512
DIFFICULT DECISIONS THIS SEASON.

35:46.545 --> 35:47.446
I INCLUDED.

POWER OF VETO.

35:58.957 --> 36:01.827
Julie: THANK YOU, PAUL, ALL
RIGHT, SINCE PAUL DID NOT USE

36:01.860 --> 36:05.764

NOMINATIONS STAY IN PLACE.

36:05.797 --> 36:10.369
JOSH AND KEVIN, FINALE NIGHT IS
LESS THAN A WEEK AWAY BUT

36:10.402 --> 36:11.570
UNFORTUNATELY ONLY ONE OF YOU
WILL MAKE IT THERE.

36:11.603 --> 36:16.107
I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE EACH OF YOU
ONE FINAL CHANCE TO ADDRESS

36:16.141 --> 36:24.149
CHRISTMAS BEFORE SHE CASTS THE
SOLE VOTE TO EVICT.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.384
JOSH, YOU'RE FIRST.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.027
EXACTLY WHO I AM.

36:36.061 --> 36:40.098
I FACED ADVERSITIES IN THIS
HOUSE AND PLAYED HARD AND PLAYED

36:40.131 --> 36:41.300
MY HEART OUT.

36:41.333 --> 36:46.338
MADE HARD DECISIONS MADE HALFS
HAD TO SECURE MY SAFETY, I WON

36:46.372 --> 36:48.774

I TOLD YOU AWHILE AGO A FRIEND
OF MINE WROTE A SONG AND BY TIM

37:16.702 --> 37:18.637
McGRAW CALLED HUMBLE AND KIND.

37:18.670 --> 37:21.640
HI A GREAT TIME, I HAD TO
EVERYONE BACK IF BOSS BE TO MY

37:21.673 --> 37:24.109
FAMILY, I LOVE YOU AND IT'S
TIME, DO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.

37:24.142 --> 37:26.445
ALL RIGHT.

37:26.478 --> 37:31.683
Julie: THANK YOU, KEVIN.

37:31.717 --> 37:32.884
THANK YOU BOTH.

37:32.918 --> 37:34.152
JUST A REMINDER, THE EVICTED
HOUSEGUEST WILL HAVE JUST A FEW

37:34.185 --> 37:34.520
MOMENTS TO SAY GOOD-BYE, GATHER
HIS BELONGINGS AND WALK OUT THE

37:34.553 --> 37:35.721
FRONT DOOR.

37:35.754 --> 37:38.189
CHRISTMAS, PLEASE STAND AT THE
FRONT OF THE LIVING ROOM, FACE

37:38.223 --> 37:44.896
THETWO NOMINEES, AND CAST YOUR
VOTE TO EVICT.

37:44.930 --> 37:47.633
>> GUYS, THIS IS A REALLY
DIFFICULT POSITION TO BE IN

37:47.666 --> 37:50.101
BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE PERSONALLY
VERY CLOSE TO ME.

37:50.135 --> 37:54.139
KEVIN YOU ARE MY HOUSE HUSBAND,
JOSH MY MEATBALL AND THIS IS NOT

37:54.172 --> 37:55.807
A PERSONAL DECISION.

37:55.841 --> 38:01.547
SO GAMEWISE YOU HAVE BOTH HAD
VERY STRATEGIC-- STRATEGIES, AND

38:01.580 --> 38:03.281
THAT IS NOT REALLY COMPARABLE.

38:03.315 --> 38:06.552
SO WHAT I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IS
WHAT THE BIG BROTHER GAME IS, IT

38:06.585 --> 38:08.587
IS A COMBINATION OF SOCIAL AND
COMPETITION.

38:08.620 --> 38:11.590
AND I BELIEVE THAT THE TOP THREE
SHOULD HAVE HAD CONTRIBUTED TO

38:11.623 --> 38:13.659
THE BURDEN OF HAVING TO SEND
SOMEBODY HOME.

38:13.692 --> 38:17.363
WITH THAT IN MIND,
UNFORTUNATELY, KEVIN, I'M SORRY,

38:17.396 --> 38:21.299
I VOTE TO EVICT YOU.

38:21.333 --> 38:31.009
Julie: KEVIN, YOU ARE EVICTED
FROM THE BIG BROTHER HOUSE.

38:31.042 --> 38:37.215
>> TAKE CARE.

38:37.248 --> 38:38.450
>> GOOD LUCK.

38:38.484 --> 38:41.219
>> GOOD LUCK TO ALL THREE OF
YOU, GOOD LUCK TO YOU, I MEAN

38:41.252 --> 38:44.189
THAT, GOOD LUCK, YOU HEAR ME?

38:44.222 --> 38:48.627
>> LET'S HOPE I CAN CARRY THIS,
MAN.

38:48.660 --> 38:49.094
>> GOOD LUCK.

38:49.127 --> 38:49.628
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

38:49.661 --> 38:52.197
ENJOY YOURSELVES, MAN.

38:52.230 --> 38:56.868
ENJOY YOURSELF.

38:56.902 --> 38:59.371
>> BE GOOD, SAY I HAD TO MY
DAUGHTERS FOR ME.

38:59.405 --> 39:01.807
>> I WILL.

39:01.840 --> 39:02.808
>> BE GOOD.

39:02.841 --> 39:05.677
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

39:05.711 --> 39:15.721
.

39:15.754 --> 39:22.561
.

39:22.594 --> 39:25.664
Julie: ALL RIGHT, KEVIN, YOU
ARE THE SHARPEST DRESSER WE EVER

39:25.697 --> 39:26.732
HAD.

39:26.765 --> 39:28.434
>> PROBABLY THE ONLY DRESSER YZ
THAT MIGHT BE TRUE.

39:28.467 --> 39:31.703
NOW YOU MADE IT SO FAR IN THE
GAME, ONLY TOO GET EVICTED ON

39:31.737 --> 39:34.906
THE FINAL EVICTION EPISODE OF
THE SHOW.

39:34.940 --> 39:37.409
ARE YOU SURPRISED TO BE SITTING
HERE RIGHT NOW?

39:37.443 --> 39:42.848
>> NO, NO.

39:42.881 --> 39:43.982
Julie: WHY?

39:44.015 --> 39:44.716
>> BECAUSE YOU CAN WORK, THE
GAME GOES YOU HAVE TO HAVE A

39:44.750 --> 39:45.951
GOOD SOCIAL TO START WHICH I
HAD.

39:45.984 --> 39:47.819
YOU HAVE TO WIN A FEW CONTESTS I
WASN'T ABLE TO WIN ANY, SO IT

39:47.853 --> 39:49.455
DOESN'T BOTHER ME,.

39:49.488 --> 39:50.556
Julie: LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

39:50.589 --> 39:51.523
>> GO AHEAD.

39:51.557 --> 39:53.258
Julie: WHO WERE YOU MOST LOYAL
TO IN THIS GAME.

39:53.291 --> 39:54.526
>> ME AND PAUL.

39:54.560 --> 39:55.561
Julie: PAUL WAS YOUR GUY.

39:55.594 --> 39:56.562
>> YEAH.

39:56.595 --> 39:58.530
Julie: ARE YOU SURPRISED HE
DIDN'T USE THE VETO.

39:58.564 --> 40:00.432
>> NO, NO, NO.

40:00.466 --> 40:03.769
IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME AT ALL, NO,
I THINK PAUL DOES WHAT HE HAS TO

40:03.802 --> 40:07.005
DO TO ENHANCE HIS GAME, IT HAS
TO GO TO A JURY.

40:07.038 --> 40:10.576
AND I GET ALONG WITH MOST OF THE
HOUSEGUESTS AND YOU KNOW, PAUL

40:10.609 --> 40:13.111
WANTS IT TO GO TO A JURY, I
DON'T THINK HE WANTS TO GO TO

40:13.144 --> 40:16.782
THE JURY AND HAVE SOMEBODY, ONE
OF THE HOUSEGUESTS-- .

40:16.815 --> 40:21.453
Julie: IN THE EVENT YOU WERE
EVICTED YOUR HOUSEGUESTS POSTED

40:21.487 --> 40:24.422
GOOD-BYE MESSAGES, LET'S WATCH
OVER MY SHOULDER.

40:24.456 --> 40:26.892
>> IF YOU ARE SEEING THIS, THEN
YOU WERE RIGHT AND CHRISTMAS

40:26.925 --> 40:29.495
WENT ROGUE AND FROM THIS POINT
FORWARD I HAVE TO FIGHT THIS ONE

40:29.528 --> 40:32.363
OUT ON MY OWN, CAN'T WAIT TO
WALK THOSE MISSION HILL STREETS

40:32.397 --> 40:35.433
WITH YOU AND LEARN THE ROAST OF
BEING A TRUE BAD ASS.

40:35.467 --> 40:37.603
>> KEVIN I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU
FOR ALL YOUR EFFORTS THROUGHOUT

40:37.636 --> 40:40.906
THE HOUSE AND MAKING IT A LITTLE
MORE COZY AND COMFORTABLE.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.875
AT THE END OF THE GAME, IF YOU
ARE SEEING THIS, I HOPE THAT YOU

40:43.909 --> 40:47.913
CAN UNDERSTAND WHY, WHAT
HAPPENED HAPPENED.

40:47.946 --> 40:51.550
>> KEVIN, I HAVE BEEN IN LINE
WITH CHRISTMAS AND PAUL AND OUR

40:51.583 --> 40:52.784
GOAL WAS TO GET A FINAL THREE.

40:52.818 --> 40:56.722
I'M SO SORRY BUT YOU WERE OUR
LAST TARGET AND NO MATTER WHERE

40:56.755 --> 41:00.726
WE STAND, AND THE MADNESS THAT
WENT DOWN IN THIS HOUSE, JUST

41:00.759 --> 41:04.429
TELL YOUR FAMILY, THAT I'M STILL
COMING OVER FOR THANKSGIVING AND

41:04.462 --> 41:07.699
THEY BETTER SAVE ME A PLATE.

41:07.733 --> 41:10.301
>> I'LL STILL HAVE HIM OVER FOR
THANKSGIVING.

41:10.335 --> 41:12.504
Julie: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF
WHAT YOU JUST HER HIM SAY.

41:12.538 --> 41:16.908
>> I KNOW, YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
AGAIN, IT IS A BIG DIFFERENCE

41:16.942 --> 41:19.044
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE SAME AGE,
THEY STAY UP, HANG OUT AND TALK

41:19.077 --> 41:22.814
AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND WERE
CLOSER IN TERMS OF THAT WAY,

41:22.848 --> 41:24.382
WHERE THEY COULD COMMUNICATE
CLOSER.

41:24.415 --> 41:26.552
IT'S FINE, THAT'S HOW THE GAME
IS PLAYED.

41:26.585 --> 41:28.286
THEY WERE ALWAYS TOGETHER,
ALWAYS TALKING.

41:28.319 --> 41:31.990
I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING GOING
ON BUT I'M NOT GOING TO COME OUT

41:32.023 --> 41:34.159
AND START CAUSING A SCENE AND
YELLING.

41:34.192 --> 41:36.728
I DID ONCE BUT THAT WAS--
.

41:36.762 --> 41:37.796

WHOLE THING.

>> SHOULD BE GREAT, THANK YOU
