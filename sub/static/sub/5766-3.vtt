00:04.800 --> 00:07.769
BLAKE:
You never know
what's going to happen.

00:07.800 --> 00:11.804
You're just out
living your life.

00:11.840 --> 00:16.504
Then, out of the blue,
no warning.

00:16.550 --> 00:19.542
How many seconds do you have?

00:22.590 --> 00:25.047
And everybody scatters.

00:25.090 --> 00:27.058
ALICIA:
Where did you get this?

00:27.090 --> 00:29.320
They're much sharper than
what they gave us in discovery.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.749
Cops make a dupe
of a dupe of a dupe

00:31.790 --> 00:33.792
just to mess
with you.

00:38.670 --> 00:40.535
BLAKE:
You can't go ten feet
in America

00:40.570 --> 00:42.504
without having
your death recorded.

00:44.510 --> 00:46.068
Boom.

00:46.110 --> 00:47.077
Where'd you get it?

00:47.110 --> 00:48.179
Northbrook Evidence.

00:48.210 --> 00:49.245
How?

00:49.280 --> 00:50.679
We've been asking them
for weeks.

00:50.710 --> 00:53.645
You don't really want to know.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.709
You're a friend
of Leela's?

00:57.750 --> 00:58.717
I'm-- who?

00:58.750 --> 01:01.218
Um, sorry,
Kalinda's.

01:01.260 --> 01:03.125
Yeah, why?

01:03.160 --> 01:04.457
Just curious.

01:04.490 --> 01:07.391
She doesn't seem to
have a lot of friends.

01:07.430 --> 01:10.627
Don't put me
in the middle
of your thing.

01:10.670 --> 01:12.399
My thing?
What's that?

01:12.440 --> 01:14.396
I have no idea, but whatever
games you're playing,

01:14.440 --> 01:18.103
you play with her.
I'm too busy, okay?

01:18.140 --> 01:19.368
Okay.

01:27.180 --> 01:29.182
You'll cue up the deaths?

01:29.220 --> 01:32.087
I will cue up
the deaths.

01:34.490 --> 01:35.559
My dad didn't do it.

01:35.590 --> 01:37.626
He didn't shoot these people?

01:37.660 --> 01:39.491
He had the same rifle.

01:39.530 --> 01:41.896
He had no alibi for the time
of the three shootings.

01:41.930 --> 01:42.897
He had the motive.

01:42.930 --> 01:44.295
He didn't have the motive.

01:44.330 --> 01:45.422
Yes, he did, Mr. Stevens.

01:45.470 --> 01:47.267
He killed two
random people,

01:47.300 --> 01:48.892
these two people--

01:48.940 --> 01:51.306
two people
he didn't even know--

01:51.340 --> 01:53.672
so he could kill his wife
and make it look like

01:53.710 --> 01:54.779
a random sniper shooting.

01:54.810 --> 01:55.902
Do you know how
crazy that sounds?

01:55.940 --> 01:57.248
That doesn't sound
crazy to me.

01:57.280 --> 01:58.838
That sounds like
the perfect murder.

01:58.880 --> 02:00.142
My dad wouldn't hurt a fly.

02:00.180 --> 02:01.772
He was a marksman in the Army.

02:01.820 --> 02:03.708
But he never shot anybody.
Then why would

02:03.750 --> 02:05.809
your mother take out
a restraining order against him?

02:05.850 --> 02:07.351
WYA'I'I': _
They were gomg
through some troubles,

02:07.390 --> 02:08.550
that's all.

02:08.590 --> 02:10.228
They were thinking
of reuniting.

02:10.260 --> 02:11.557
No, there's no proof
of that.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.899
My dad didn't
do this.

02:13.930 --> 02:15.158
He couldn't do this.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.599
And the state's attorney
hounded him,

02:16.630 --> 02:18.598
they persecuted him,
and they never proved a thing.

02:18.630 --> 02:19.892
No, they never convicted him.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.339
They never proved a thing!

02:21.370 --> 02:23.634
That trial

02:23.670 --> 02:24.705
killed him.

02:26.210 --> 02:28.701
He died of a heart attack.

02:28.740 --> 02:30.571
He died 30 years too early.

02:30.610 --> 02:32.942
And now you're looking
for somebody else to blame?

02:32.980 --> 02:35.141
Yes. But that doesn't mean
they shouldn't be blamed.

02:37.720 --> 02:39.415
DERRICK:
Okay.

02:39.460 --> 02:42.281
Why don't we take a break.

02:44.290 --> 02:46.690
Good job, Wyatt.

02:46.730 --> 02:47.924
You okay?

02:47.960 --> 02:48.927
Yeah.
Will the questioning

02:48.960 --> 02:50.621
be that tough?
Tougher.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.331
In a deposition,
they hit you hard,

02:52.370 --> 02:53.837
try to scare you off a suit.

02:53.870 --> 02:54.939
Just do what you did.

02:54.970 --> 02:56.562
We just need a minute, Wyatt.

02:56.610 --> 02:57.736
Was I too emotional?

02:57.770 --> 02:59.169
No, not for a deposition.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.840
It's a difficult one--
maIICIous prosecution.

03:05.880 --> 03:08.519
You have to prove not only
there was a rush to judgment,

03:08.550 --> 03:10.211
but his father was innocent.

03:10.250 --> 03:11.387
Where's his head on this?

03:11.420 --> 03:12.455
He's mourning.

03:12.490 --> 03:13.718
His mother was murdered.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.955
His father spent
the last year in jail.

03:15.990 --> 03:17.787
He wants prosecutors
to clear his name.

03:17.830 --> 03:19.491
They won't do that.

03:19.530 --> 03:20.952
They may give him
a few dollars.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.558
Will he take a few dollars?

03:22.600 --> 03:23.965
I can talk to him.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.560
That seems to be
your speCIalty here:

03:26.600 --> 03:28.795
lowering the clients'
expectations.

03:28.840 --> 03:31.263
Inspiring work.

03:31.310 --> 03:34.006
Okay, we'll meet
with the esteemed

03:34.040 --> 03:36.600
state's attorney,
see what kind of settlement

03:36.650 --> 03:37.969
we can shake loose.

03:38.010 --> 03:38.977
OWEN:
Please note that

03:39.010 --> 03:42.343
A sub-N plus two equals

03:42.390 --> 03:45.689
A sub-N plus one, plus one.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.551
And we have
a homogeneous recurrence.

03:47.590 --> 03:48.557
And there you go,

03:48.590 --> 03:49.921
easy as pie.

03:49.960 --> 03:50.984
(laughter)

03:51.030 --> 03:51.849
Any questions?

03:51.890 --> 03:54.552
No. Okay, well,
my work here is done.

03:54.600 --> 03:55.919
(laughter)

03:55.960 --> 03:57.689
Why the University of Oregon?

03:57.730 --> 04:00.437
Uh, why am I teaching
at the University of Oregon

04:00.470 --> 04:01.994
and not here at my alma mater?

04:02.040 --> 04:04.964
Clearly, you've never spent
a winter in Chicago.

04:05.010 --> 04:06.432
(laughter)
Uh, I don't know.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.539
I, um, I like the West Coast.

04:08.580 --> 04:10.002
I get to wear these.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.268
(laughter)

04:12.320 --> 04:14.618
Uh, any questions
about the formula?

04:14.650 --> 04:16.982
Uh, Professor Cavanaugh,
I have to ask.

04:17.020 --> 04:19.318
Uh, Alicia Florrick
is your sister, right?

04:19.360 --> 04:20.759
Right.

04:20.790 --> 04:22.280
Uh, so do you
see her much?

04:22.330 --> 04:24.286
Amway,

04:24.330 --> 04:25.729
A sub-n plus two...
(laughter)

04:25.760 --> 04:27.352
(chuckles)

04:27.400 --> 04:30.563
Uh, well, now, uh, I see you've
got your cell phone there.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.568
This-this isn't gonna
end up on YouTube, is it?

04:32.600 --> 04:33.589
No.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.289
I'm just recording
for my studies.

04:35.340 --> 04:36.739
Fair enough.

04:36.770 --> 04:38.601
I love my sister.

04:38.640 --> 04:41.370
I love my sister more than
I love the golden ratio,

04:41.410 --> 04:43.378
which is-- it's a lot.
(laughter)

04:43.410 --> 04:46.743
Uh, you will not find
a finer human being

04:46.780 --> 04:48.042
on the face of the earth.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.014
But, uh, no,
1-1 don't see her much.

04:50.050 --> 04:51.483
Is it because of the scandal?

04:51.520 --> 04:53.078
No.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.384
I think it's because her husband
is uncomfortable that I'm gay.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.081
No, I like Peter.
(choking)

04:57.130 --> 04:59.348
He's a great guy,

04:59.400 --> 05:00.799
except for that
sleeping with hookers thing.

05:00.830 --> 05:02.718
(laughter)

05:02.770 --> 05:06.888
Uh, but, for me, uh, homophobia
is a stumbling block, you know.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.089
Call me crazy.

05:08.140 --> 05:09.095
(laughter)

05:09.140 --> 05:10.801
Nora!

05:10.840 --> 05:12.876
The impulse toward
community service

05:12.910 --> 05:16.971
has taken a backseat
to economic and job concerns.

05:17.010 --> 05:18.841
Yeah. What?
But service
is the key.

05:18.880 --> 05:22.441
Chicago needs that idealism,
Chicago needs...

05:22.490 --> 05:24.082
That should've been
on my desk this morning.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.348
What is he talking about?

05:25.390 --> 05:26.982
...now more than ever.

05:27.020 --> 05:30.023
I want to thank you,

05:30.060 --> 05:33.393
100 Black Men of Chicago,

05:33.430 --> 05:36.365
because you have made service
popular again.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.095
And for that
I applaud all of you.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.439
(applause)

05:40.470 --> 05:43.439
Well, then don't bother me
about it again.

05:43.470 --> 05:44.459
Okay?

05:44.510 --> 05:46.637
Thank you.
Yeah.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.635
What's wrong?

05:47.680 --> 05:48.635
Nothing.

05:48.680 --> 05:50.045
Something.
Just hold on.

05:50.080 --> 05:51.104
Look, I got to go.

05:51.150 --> 05:52.640
No, do it yourself!

05:52.680 --> 05:54.614
Peter, I need you to
be honest with me.

05:54.650 --> 05:56.447
Do you have a problem
with gay people?

05:56.490 --> 05:57.343
Do I have a problem with--

05:57.390 --> 05:59.017
What are you,
what are you talking about?

05:59.050 --> 06:00.051
Are you uncomfortable
with them?

06:00.090 --> 06:02.627
Oh, Eli, look, I couldn't
care less if you're gay.

06:02.660 --> 06:03.820
Oh, my God, Peter.

06:03.860 --> 06:05.384
I'm not gay, it's
your brother-in-law.

06:05.430 --> 06:07.455
And he thinks
you're a homophobe.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.455
Owen?

06:08.500 --> 06:10.468
He's visiting lecturer
at DePaul University,

06:10.500 --> 06:12.764
and he said he hadn't
visited his sister in a while

06:12.800 --> 06:14.495
because you're
homophobic.

06:14.540 --> 06:15.495
(laughs)

06:15.540 --> 06:16.564
Oh, you find
this amusing?

06:16.610 --> 06:18.430
No, no.

06:18.470 --> 06:19.869
It's Owen; he talks.

06:19.910 --> 06:21.104
He's...
Well,

06:21.140 --> 06:22.471
he can't do
that, Peter.

06:22.510 --> 06:24.068
It's on the
Internet.

06:24.110 --> 06:26.817
The Chicago gay population
is small, but it's powerful.

06:26.850 --> 06:28.613
It has money.
Good job.

06:28.650 --> 06:30.880
OhmPH
talk to him.

06:30.920 --> 06:32.512
Calm down.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.310
Thank you for coming.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.713
Thanks for listening.
Thanks a lot.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.421
Calm down,
this is an easy one.

06:36.460 --> 06:37.950
Thank you.
Cut to.

06:46.670 --> 06:49.468
It was a bad
prosecution.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.569
You had the wrong man,

06:51.610 --> 06:53.100
you had the
wrong facts,

06:53.140 --> 06:55.131
and you drove an innocent
man to his grave.

06:55.180 --> 06:57.774
Are we really using
words like "innocent"?

06:57.810 --> 07:00.176
What would you call
Richard Jewell?

07:00.220 --> 07:01.414
Not charged.

07:02.050 --> 07:03.210
GLENN:
How much?

07:03.250 --> 07:06.014
He had a heart attack.

07:06.050 --> 07:07.153
He died at 50.

07:07.190 --> 07:08.487
How much?

07:25.240 --> 07:28.471
I think you're underestimating
our resolve.

07:28.510 --> 07:32.514
No, I just don't think I'm gonna
buckle to your political agenda.

07:32.550 --> 07:36.486
When did Lockhart, Gardner
& Bond start carrying water

07:36.520 --> 07:37.589
for the Peter
Florrick campaign?

07:37.620 --> 07:38.587
Oh, you're reading this
wrong, Glenn.

07:38.620 --> 07:40.554
Am I, Diane? Really?

07:40.590 --> 07:42.057
Who's running
this case?

07:42.090 --> 07:43.887
Not in the front office.
Who's in the boiler room?

07:43.930 --> 07:45.557
You want an itemized list?
I'll tell you who.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.148
Alicia Florrick-- that's who.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.589
We're not giving
you a cent

07:49.630 --> 07:50.597
as long as
you're running interference

07:50.630 --> 07:51.619
for the Florrick campaign.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.099
Get out of
my office.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.533
We need to talk
about this.

07:57.570 --> 07:58.559
Yep.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.109
I'm busy, Mr. Gold.

08:02.140 --> 08:03.277
I'll walk with you.

08:03.310 --> 08:04.743
Sounds serious.

08:04.780 --> 08:07.044
I'm about to lose
$800,000 in soft money

08:07.080 --> 08:09.014
from the gay community,
so, yes, it is serious.

08:09.050 --> 08:10.017
How'd that happen?

08:10.050 --> 08:11.540
Your brother.

08:12.920 --> 08:15.150
He's a visiting professor
at DePaul University.

08:15.190 --> 08:17.158
I know. What did he do?

08:17.190 --> 08:20.023
He said he doesn't visit much
because Peter is homophobic.

08:20.060 --> 08:21.925
(laughs)

08:21.960 --> 08:24.599
Why is everyone
finding that so funny?

08:24.630 --> 08:26.962
It's just Owen.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.194
He just talks.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.559
Okay, well,
he needs to

08:29.610 --> 08:31.999
talk to someone
and say he was joking.

08:32.040 --> 08:34.304
Spencer Roth, a lobbyist...

08:34.340 --> 08:36.001
Hey, Will.

08:36.040 --> 08:37.007
How are you?

08:37.050 --> 08:40.019
Good. Papers
are upstairs.

08:40.050 --> 08:42.041
I'm on my way.

08:45.320 --> 08:46.548
Peter's campaign?

08:46.590 --> 08:48.808
Always a source
of amusement.

08:48.860 --> 08:50.327
Smart of you to stay
out of the picture.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.554
It's called survival.

08:51.590 --> 08:55.094
Look, about the sniper lawsuit,
don't take this the wrong way.

08:58.100 --> 09:00.637
I'm sorry, that's a bad way
to start a conversation.

09:00.670 --> 09:02.558
The partners discussed it and...

09:02.610 --> 09:03.963
They're dropping it?
No, no.

09:04.010 --> 09:05.637
We're going forward.
We're just running into

09:05.670 --> 09:08.639
some political complications.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.970
You want me to
take a step back?

09:12.010 --> 09:14.342
Just until we gain some traction
in the negotiations.

09:14.380 --> 09:17.611
They think this is
about Peter's campaign?

09:17.650 --> 09:20.016
Yes. We are going head-to-head
against his opponent.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.688
We need to tread carefully.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.857
Look,

09:24.890 --> 09:27.597
I know this is your case.

09:27.630 --> 09:29.325
I know how hard
you've worked on this.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.999
No. No, I get it.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.065
It's okay.

09:33.100 --> 09:34.738
If it's a win, it's your win.

09:34.770 --> 09:36.806
I know.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.974
I'm fine. Really.

09:40.010 --> 09:41.773
Good, thanks.

09:41.810 --> 09:44.347
Um, did they ask
you to tell me?

09:44.380 --> 09:46.143
Diane and Derrick?

09:46.180 --> 09:48.671
No, I volunteered.

09:53.820 --> 09:56.789
Captioning sponsored by
CBS

10:04.400 --> 10:06.220
Mrs. Timmerman,
just one question.
I have to go. I'm sorry.

10:06.270 --> 10:07.965
Just one question, ma'am.
You've heard these news reports

10:08.000 --> 10:08.989
about your husband
taking his aide

10:09.040 --> 10:10.029
to a clinic for
an abortion.

10:10.070 --> 10:11.332
My husband is innocent.

10:11.370 --> 10:13.031
Okay, but did he
deny it, ma'am?

10:13.080 --> 10:14.638
Did he deny he got
her an abortion?

10:14.680 --> 10:15.908
He didn't need to.

10:15.940 --> 10:17.271
I'm sorry, I have to go.

10:19.280 --> 10:20.975
the congressman's staff
reeling.

10:21.020 --> 10:23.284
And Lana Timmerman has found
herself joining a long list

10:23.320 --> 10:25.948
of long- suffering wives.

10:25.990 --> 10:27.958
Remember, they may hit you hard.

10:27.990 --> 10:29.150
Where's Alicia?

10:29.190 --> 10:30.157
She's around.

10:30.190 --> 10:31.851
Don't worry,
you'll be fine.

10:34.430 --> 10:35.192
Hello, Mr. Stevens.

10:35.230 --> 10:36.925
I'm Wendy Scott-Carr
for Cook County.

10:36.970 --> 10:37.925
Hello.

10:37.970 --> 10:40.689
Are you nervous?

10:40.740 --> 10:41.991
No.

10:42.040 --> 10:43.905
As much as
you'd expect.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.416
Some gum?

10:58.450 --> 11:01.055
No, thank you.

11:01.090 --> 11:02.352
I'll have it.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.304
Does Miss Scott-Carr have
a questions?

11:18.340 --> 11:21.798
I do. Thank you.

11:24.110 --> 11:26.101
Did your dad drink,
Mr. Stevens?

11:26.150 --> 11:28.038
Did my dad? Yes.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.069
You mean alcohol?

11:30.450 --> 11:31.883
He did, but not a lot.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.080
Don't worry. It's not

11:33.120 --> 11:34.087
a freighted question

11:34.120 --> 11:35.883
My dad used to drink.

11:35.920 --> 11:38.286
Well, heck, anybody
who grew up in Chicago

11:38.330 --> 11:41.049
probably had
a dad who drank.

11:43.270 --> 11:46.091
Now I've got to ask you, Wyatt.

11:46.130 --> 11:47.233
You know, actually,

11:47.270 --> 11:48.760
let me just...

11:53.010 --> 11:54.238
11-years-old.

11:54.280 --> 11:57.147
I loved them both,

11:57.180 --> 12:01.947
but, goodness,
watching them fight...

12:01.980 --> 12:03.811
Objection.

12:05.190 --> 12:07.988
All I'm saying is, I get it.

12:08.020 --> 12:10.955
It doesn't mean
that people don't
love each other,

12:10.990 --> 12:11.979
that they fight.

12:12.030 --> 12:12.997
Do you believe that?

12:13.030 --> 12:16.522
That people can love each other
and fight? Yes.

12:16.560 --> 12:20.530
So, tell me about this
restraining order

12:20.570 --> 12:21.832
your mom brought.

12:21.870 --> 12:23.007
It's not like you're suggesting.

12:23.040 --> 12:24.928
I know. I know.

12:24.970 --> 12:27.939
Every marriage
is different.

12:27.980 --> 12:30.972
But your mom went
into the hospital

12:31.010 --> 12:33.171
with a cut on her cheek.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.778
You took her in.

12:34.820 --> 12:36.447
That's, that's okay.

12:36.480 --> 12:40.155
The human reaction is to
protect our loved ones,

12:40.190 --> 12:41.851
their memories.

12:41.890 --> 12:43.983
That's good.

12:46.190 --> 12:49.921
Let's just... talk.

12:52.070 --> 12:55.039
(quietly):
She's killing us.

12:55.070 --> 12:56.469
Come on, Spencer.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.058
Peter is not a homophobe.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.169
Why do you think I'm always
about the gay issues?

13:00.210 --> 13:02.075
Because you're always
about the gay issues.

13:02.110 --> 13:05.546
Look, I-I phoned Marcus
Alden, Danny Trent.

13:05.580 --> 13:06.444
Gay money has dried up,

13:06.480 --> 13:08.209
waiting to find out
which way you'll jump.

13:08.250 --> 13:09.342
"Gay money." You have

13:09.380 --> 13:11.189
such a succinct way
of putting things.

13:11.220 --> 13:12.448
Oh, I'm sorry.
Have I offended you?

13:12.490 --> 13:14.458
You've been invited
to dinner with Peter

13:14.490 --> 13:16.958
and his brother-in-law
to prove they pass
the sniff test.

13:16.990 --> 13:18.252
Let me show you a picture.

13:18.290 --> 13:20.190
Spencer, I've seen
your nieces.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.428
What is it?

13:23.470 --> 13:24.596
Here's your client,

13:24.630 --> 13:26.894
and here's the book
he's carrying.

13:32.140 --> 13:33.971
You're kidding me?

13:34.010 --> 13:35.432
This isn't about
straight/gay?

13:35.480 --> 13:37.300
It's about
Jewish/ Palestine?

13:37.350 --> 13:38.305
It's not a joke, Eli.

13:38.350 --> 13:40.568
Ah, it is a joke.
You're holding on to the money

13:40.620 --> 13:42.315
because you think
Peter is...
Soft on Israel.

13:42.350 --> 13:44.409
Oh, my God,
I'm in crazy town.

13:44.450 --> 13:45.883
So, is he?

13:45.920 --> 13:49.481
Pro-Palestinian? No. No!

13:49.520 --> 13:51.226
I don't know.
Anybody could've read that book.

13:51.260 --> 13:53.399
Would I be working for him
if he was pro-Palestinian?

13:53.430 --> 13:56.319
And he's running
for State's Attorney,

13:56.360 --> 13:57.918
not Secretary of State.

13:57.970 --> 13:59.892
But you have designs
on going national, don't you?

13:59.940 --> 14:01.965
You don't care about a little
State's Attorney race.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.501
Look, the dinner
you're invited to,

14:07.540 --> 14:10.304
is to break fast for Yom Kippur.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.272
Oh, come on.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.949
What, do you think
I would make up a lie like that?

14:14.980 --> 14:17.881
Your gentile friends just happen
to be breaking fast?

14:17.920 --> 14:19.581
Peter and Alicia are having me
over because,

14:19.620 --> 14:21.451
as you well know,
I have no life.

14:21.490 --> 14:24.186
So come on,

14:24.230 --> 14:25.982
talk to Peter.

14:26.030 --> 14:29.488
Find out how much he loves gays
and Israel.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.395
(indistinct police radio
transmission)

15:09.440 --> 15:11.635
WOMAN (over radio):
10-01, unable to copy.

15:11.670 --> 15:14.605
(garbled radio transmission)

15:14.640 --> 15:17.302
(turns down police scanner
volume)

15:20.220 --> 15:23.018
(indistinct police radio
broadcast)

15:23.050 --> 15:26.019
RADIO DISPATCHER:
I need any and all units
to report back in the vicinity

15:26.050 --> 15:27.415
of the El Street Mall.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.416
211. 10-29F.

15:29.460 --> 15:31.485
DISPATCHER 2:
All units, I repeat,
we need all units!

15:31.530 --> 15:33.953
Shots fired! Civilian down!
Emergency call!

15:34.000 --> 15:35.956
(people clamoring)

15:36.000 --> 15:38.298
Oh, my God, he's looking like
the Northbrook sniper again!

15:40.370 --> 15:42.964
(tires squealing)

15:43.010 --> 15:43.999
(sirens wailing)

15:44.040 --> 15:46.258
(two gunshots)

15:47.380 --> 15:50.406
(tires squeal, gunshot)
All right, move!

15:50.450 --> 15:52.042
RADIO DISPATCHER:
All units in position.

15:52.080 --> 15:54.514
Stand by. Suspect in sight.

15:54.550 --> 15:55.710
5-1, negative.

15:55.750 --> 15:57.183
Copy 2, negative.

15:57.220 --> 15:59.586
(tires squealing)

16:00.520 --> 16:02.351
(garbled radio communication)

16:02.390 --> 16:04.426
(brakes screeching)

16:04.460 --> 16:05.722
OFFICER (over radio):
Target the vehicle's tires.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.250
You're clear to ﬁre.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.198
OFFICER 2:
Roger that.

16:08.230 --> 16:11.427
(woman speaking frantically
over radio)

16:11.470 --> 16:13.438
OFFICER:
All units hold your fire.

16:13.470 --> 16:14.494
OFFICER 2:
Copy.

16:17.340 --> 16:18.307
Kalinda.

16:18.340 --> 16:19.307
Hey.

16:19.340 --> 16:21.137
This is ongoing.
This...

16:25.510 --> 16:27.171
(man shouting)
(thud)

16:29.650 --> 16:31.538
Go! Go! Go!
Come on! Move, move, move, move!

16:31.590 --> 16:33.319
Go, go, go, go!

16:33.360 --> 16:34.611
Don't move!

16:34.660 --> 16:36.059
Don't move!

16:36.090 --> 16:38.058
Get him out! Get him out!

16:38.090 --> 16:39.557
Get him out!
On your feet, man!

16:39.590 --> 16:41.091
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

16:41.130 --> 16:43.496
On your feet!
Right there!
Oh, God!

16:43.530 --> 16:45.589
(man groans)
Don't move!

16:45.630 --> 16:46.619
OFFICER:
Drop the weapon.

16:46.670 --> 16:48.137
OFFICER 2:
The van's clear.

16:48.170 --> 16:49.489
(siren wailing)
Truck's secure.

16:49.540 --> 16:51.030
(coughing)
Clear.

16:51.070 --> 16:53.277
He put a slot in the back
of the van

16:53.310 --> 16:54.334
for the rifle barrel and scope.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.109
Do we know why?

16:56.140 --> 16:57.107
Not yet.
No priors.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.105
But they suspect

16:58.150 --> 16:59.401
he's the real Northbrook sniper?

16:59.450 --> 17:01.509
The police consider the
Northbrook case closed,

17:01.550 --> 17:04.348
but it's the same
rifle, same M.O.

17:04.390 --> 17:05.379
I just heard.

17:05.420 --> 17:07.115
You want me to run it?

17:07.160 --> 17:08.388
Victim?

17:09.490 --> 17:12.425
28-year-old mother of
two, Lisa Rennick.

17:12.460 --> 17:13.529
Shot in the head.

17:13.560 --> 17:14.629
Same as Northbrook.

17:14.660 --> 17:16.252
Can we get a ballistics match?

17:16.300 --> 17:17.665
I'll get on it.

17:17.700 --> 17:19.395
No, Kalinda, you go.

17:20.870 --> 17:23.202
Blake, I'll need you
on Murphy/Gomes.

17:23.240 --> 17:25.401
Hey, don't overpay.

17:25.440 --> 17:28.329
DERRICK:
The rest of you, I'll need
you to get everything you can

17:28.380 --> 17:30.507
from Alicia
on the other victims.

17:32.110 --> 17:33.111
Did you hear?

17:33.150 --> 17:34.344
Yes.

17:34.380 --> 17:35.347
Talk about lucky.

17:35.380 --> 17:36.847
I mean, except for the death.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.643
We need to double our ask.

17:38.690 --> 17:41.511
My guess is Childs will be
phoning in about an hour,

17:41.560 --> 17:43.425
trying to cut a quick deal--
with a gag order.

17:43.460 --> 17:46.486
Then let's double our ask.

17:46.530 --> 17:48.157
Police arrested
Northbrook resident Carl...

17:48.200 --> 17:49.599
ALICIA:
Yes, I'm watching right now.

17:49.630 --> 17:51.723
We need to double our ask.

17:51.770 --> 17:53.294
Okay, good.

17:53.340 --> 17:54.864
I'll be in in 15 minutes.

17:54.900 --> 17:58.506
Oh, uh... okay.

17:58.540 --> 18:00.679
Well, I'm here if you need me.

18:00.710 --> 18:02.769
(doorbell rings,
phone beeps off)

18:06.850 --> 18:08.511
(laughs)

18:08.550 --> 18:11.417
I wore this for Peter.

18:11.450 --> 18:13.315
And jokes over.
I got to change.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.885
This... is for you.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.649
And this...

18:17.690 --> 18:20.079
is for Peter.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.491
(giggles)

18:23.530 --> 18:24.827
Oh, come on.

18:24.870 --> 18:27.338
It's true, Peter
doesn't like me.

18:27.370 --> 18:29.497
Yeah, but he doesn't like you
because you're a jerk,

18:29.540 --> 18:30.609
not because you're gay.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.528
You have to make it right.

18:32.570 --> 18:34.572
I know, I know.

18:34.610 --> 18:36.430
(sighs)

18:36.480 --> 18:37.549
I like this.

18:37.580 --> 18:39.377
Why don't we do
this more often?

18:39.410 --> 18:41.219
Because you live
in Oregon.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.672
Oh, right.

18:42.720 --> 18:45.609
Did you hear mom's divorcing
number three?

18:45.650 --> 18:46.514
Yeah.

18:46.550 --> 18:48.211
I didn't like him anyway.

18:48.260 --> 18:50.421
He had a good singing voice.

18:50.460 --> 18:52.280
(laughs)

18:52.330 --> 18:53.854
He was kind of showy.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.527
The bling.

18:55.560 --> 18:57.596
(both chuckle)

18:57.630 --> 19:00.235
Did mom phone you to tell you?

19:00.270 --> 19:01.635
No, she wrote.

19:01.670 --> 19:04.332
Afraid of the Alicia stare.

19:04.370 --> 19:06.509
The what?
Uh, you know.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.834
I don't...

19:09.880 --> 19:11.643
When have I ever done that?

19:11.680 --> 19:13.739
When somebody doesn't live up
to your standards.

19:13.780 --> 19:15.543
You make me sound
like such a bitch.

19:15.580 --> 19:16.717
No...

19:16.750 --> 19:18.615
proper.

19:18.650 --> 19:20.140
Ow!

19:23.560 --> 19:25.528
Are you going to leave him?

19:28.700 --> 19:31.624
Owen, please don't.
He's two-faced.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.297
Everyone's two-faced.
You're not.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.865
Yes, I am.
Then you've changed.

19:35.900 --> 19:40.508
No. Issues got more complex,

19:40.540 --> 19:41.609
and I grew up.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.870
You've always been grown up.

19:43.910 --> 19:47.676
Remember that little speech
you gave Mom and Dad.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.211
Oh, my God.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.741
"You can do this to me,

19:52.790 --> 19:54.758
but you can't
do it to Owen."

19:54.790 --> 19:57.623
Yeah. See how well that worked?

19:57.660 --> 19:59.719
They got divorced anyway.

20:01.430 --> 20:03.569
So that's what this is about,

20:03.600 --> 20:05.397
not wanting to be
like Mom and Dad.

20:05.430 --> 20:08.695
Does everything have
to be about something?

20:08.740 --> 20:11.709
Yeah. I read a piece about it
in the Times, I think.

20:11.740 --> 20:13.537
(phone rings)

20:13.580 --> 20:14.672
You know what you need?

20:14.710 --> 20:15.529
An intervention.

20:15.580 --> 20:17.707
I'm gonna be here
for three more days.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.706
And at the end
of those three days,

20:19.750 --> 20:20.648
you are divorcing Peter.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.409
Hello.

20:22.450 --> 20:24.486
WILL:
Turn on channel two;
we got a problem.

20:24.520 --> 20:25.544
What? Why?

20:25.590 --> 20:27.785
Who is it?
(TV clicks on)

20:27.820 --> 20:29.981
(reporters clamoring)
We have a suspect in custody.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.624
But I want to be clear
about this.

20:31.660 --> 20:33.355
This is not
the Northbrook sniper.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.856
You're kidding.
What?

20:34.900 --> 20:37.596
The shooting bears many of the
same trademarks as Northbrook,

20:37.630 --> 20:39.029
but this sniper is a copycat.

20:39.070 --> 20:40.492
And this lawsuit has put

20:40.540 --> 20:42.394
the Northbrook shootings
back in the news lately,

20:42.440 --> 20:44.408
and unfortunately...
He's blaming us.

20:44.440 --> 20:47.432
WILL: Yep.
It's a whole new ballgame.

20:53.050 --> 20:56.577
Am I angry? Yes.

20:56.620 --> 20:58.679
Wyatt Stevens was innocent.

20:58.720 --> 21:01.757
The State's Attorney
is grasping at straws

21:01.790 --> 21:03.883
trying to thwart our suit

21:03.930 --> 21:07.354
by insisting that
this new sniper is a copycat.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.799
WILL:
So we prove he's not.

21:08.830 --> 21:12.061
For the next 48 hours,
we want a full-court press.

21:12.100 --> 21:14.489
DIANE:
And we still need
to prove the prosecution's

21:14.540 --> 21:16.735
malice in the original case
against Wyatt,

21:16.770 --> 21:18.931
So we're splitting you
into two groups.

21:18.970 --> 21:22.428
Jim, Tom, Dave,
Judy, Margie and Al,

21:22.480 --> 21:25.369
you are focusing on proving
Wyatt's innocence.

21:25.410 --> 21:29.619
The rest of you go to malice.

21:29.650 --> 21:30.844
We should think through
the pattern.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.118
DERRICK:
Explain.

21:32.150 --> 21:34.880
The police never found a pattern
with the first three victims.

21:34.920 --> 21:37.423
Now we have a fourth.

21:37.460 --> 21:38.688
Let's see if it adds up.

21:38.730 --> 21:40.789
Right, good.
Get everything you can.

21:40.830 --> 21:42.821
I'll follow
pre-trial motions.

21:42.860 --> 21:43.929
DIANE:
You mean
on the new case?

21:43.970 --> 21:45.562
Yeah. Carl Landers.

21:45.600 --> 21:46.897
Childs will want to
isolate this case

21:46.930 --> 21:48.329
from the earlier
three shootings,

21:48.370 --> 21:49.928
but he'll need
to throw everything he can

21:49.970 --> 21:51.506
at him to get a conviction.

21:51.540 --> 21:54.304
He'll be tipping his hand.
Good. Go.

22:04.990 --> 22:07.083
You think I'm
your competition.

22:07.120 --> 22:08.656
No.

22:08.690 --> 22:10.829
I don't care if you're
my competition.

22:10.860 --> 22:12.555
Oh. Well, that's
good to hear, Leela.

22:12.590 --> 22:13.818
I... Sorry.

22:13.860 --> 22:17.023
I keep on slipping
on that, don't I?

22:17.060 --> 22:19.995
Don't forget to
use condoms.

22:23.910 --> 22:26.538
You seem to think
you know something.

22:28.410 --> 22:30.799
You don't.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.374
You're probably right.

22:32.410 --> 22:34.412
(elevator bell dings)

22:35.880 --> 22:37.438
Go ahead.

22:37.490 --> 22:39.378
I'll take the next one.

22:46.490 --> 22:47.286
Well, this is crazy, Eli,

22:47.330 --> 22:48.888
because I never read
the Carter book.

22:48.930 --> 22:50.090
ELI:
Spencer has a picture of you

22:50.130 --> 22:52.018
outside your apartment
carrying it.

22:52.070 --> 22:53.537
Oh.

22:53.570 --> 22:54.992
It's probably Alicia's.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.735
I was cleaning out
the maid's room.

22:56.770 --> 22:59.068
They would have seen me come out
with a bag of clothes

22:59.110 --> 23:01.601
for Goodwill if he had
waited around another minute.

23:02.980 --> 23:04.902
I know this sounds
a little Dumb and Dumber,

23:04.950 --> 23:07.919
but I invited him over
to your house for Yom Kippur.

23:07.950 --> 23:09.918
Yom Kippur?

23:09.950 --> 23:12.089
I'm having Yom Kippur
at my house?

23:12.120 --> 23:14.111
Yes.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.151
Tomorrow.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.757
Okay.

23:19.790 --> 23:22.054
CARY:
Carl Landers shot a woman
at the mail, Your Honor.

23:22.100 --> 23:23.624
Pursuant to the public
terrorism statute,

23:23.670 --> 23:25.729
bail is out of the question.
WOMAN:
Wait a minute.

23:25.770 --> 23:27.169
The State's Attorney
himself said

23:27.200 --> 23:28.861
that this was_
my client's first time.

23:28.900 --> 23:31.903
Ergo, there is no
public terrorism.

23:31.940 --> 23:33.931
They can't have
it both ways.

23:33.980 --> 23:35.936
We don't need to
have it both ways.

23:35.980 --> 23:39.609
Your Honor, Mr. Landers
is a flight risk.

23:39.650 --> 23:41.447
Bail denied.
Mr. Landers will be held.

23:41.480 --> 23:42.777
What else?

23:42.820 --> 23:46.142
The defense would exercise
its right to a speed...

23:46.190 --> 23:48.886
Would you excuse me,
Your Honor?

23:52.060 --> 23:53.948
Your Honor?

23:54.000 --> 23:56.059
I would like to point
out at this time

23:56.100 --> 23:57.965
that the _defense_
attorney is in collu5ion

23:58.000 --> 24:00.025
with the lavwers that are
bringing the Northbrook suit.

24:00.070 --> 24:01.662
JUDGE DE LA PIEDRA:
Fascinated, Mr. Agos,

24:01.700 --> 24:03.133
but I'm not sure
what I can do about it.

24:03.170 --> 24:05.968
Your Honor, in the interest
of expediency,

24:06.010 --> 24:09.036
I have just noticed that...
that the prosecution

24:09.080 --> 24:12.072
has omitted a key witness
from their witness list.

24:12.110 --> 24:13.099
A Detective Mangold.

24:13.150 --> 24:15.539
He was the detective in
the Northbrook killings.

24:15.580 --> 24:18.515
We would move to amend
our own list to include him.

24:18.550 --> 24:19.881
So moved.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.911
That may prove to be difficult,
Your Honor.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.154
And why is that,
Mr. Agos?

24:25.030 --> 24:27.157
We ask that we continue this
in chambers, Your Honor.

24:27.190 --> 24:29.829
It's going to become part
of the public record

24:29.860 --> 24:31.066
either way, Mr. Agos.

24:31.100 --> 24:32.124
Let's go.

24:35.000 --> 24:35.796
He sustained an injury

24:35.840 --> 24:37.728
in the line of duty
four months ago.

24:37.770 --> 24:39.863
Started ta king
Vicodin for the pain.

24:39.910 --> 24:41.138
He's in rehab.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.932
And if we can
show that Mangold

24:42.980 --> 24:45.608
was hooked on Vikes at the time
of the Wyatt investigation...

24:45.650 --> 24:47.208
That could go to malice.

24:47.250 --> 24:49.047
Good job. Follow it up.

24:55.960 --> 24:57.086
Can I make a suggestion?

24:57.120 --> 24:58.758
Certainly.

24:58.790 --> 25:02.191
You should get Alicia
to help the other team.

25:02.230 --> 25:03.925
She made this case her life.

25:03.970 --> 25:05.119
She knows it in and out.

25:05.170 --> 25:06.967
Thanks.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.637
How are you and Blake
getting on?

25:11.170 --> 25:13.104
Couldn't be better.

25:15.640 --> 25:18.006
Three shootings:
Noreen Paulus,

25:18.050 --> 25:20.746
Roy Cammell,
Amelia Stevens.

25:20.780 --> 25:22.111
Now a fourth.

25:23.150 --> 25:24.048
Lisa Rennick.

25:24.090 --> 25:25.944
What do these four
people have in common?

25:25.990 --> 25:26.888
The thing is,

25:26.920 --> 25:29.081
we'd have a pattern
if it weren't for...

25:29.120 --> 25:31.054
The lack of a pattern.

25:31.090 --> 25:33.058
No. The UPE man.

25:33.090 --> 25:34.694
Three women shot, one man.

25:34.730 --> 25:36.129
Yep.

25:36.160 --> 25:38.196
Odd man out.

25:40.300 --> 25:41.733
Wait.

25:41.770 --> 25:43.260
What?

25:50.140 --> 25:52.108
BLAKE:
Here's the thing.

25:52.150 --> 25:55.119
I know you have backseat
and front-facing cameras.

25:55.150 --> 25:57.948
And I know you like
to download and store

25:57.990 --> 26:00.049
digital recordings
to protect yourself

26:00.090 --> 26:03.355
from any potential lawsuits
filed by customers.

26:03.390 --> 26:04.789
Now let me say this.

26:04.830 --> 26:06.127
I see you have
some potential

26:06.160 --> 26:08.128
undocumented workers
here in your yard,

26:08.160 --> 26:10.219
and I would hate for you
to get into any trouble.

26:10.260 --> 26:13.127
But I also know that you
really want to help us out,

26:13.170 --> 26:16.196
so maybe we can make
some kind of deal.

26:26.310 --> 26:27.345
There.

26:40.230 --> 26:41.993
Is that what I think it is?

26:47.030 --> 26:48.759
He was aiming for her.

26:51.710 --> 26:53.405
So they're all women--
all four.

26:53.440 --> 26:55.237
That's what we think.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.942
Missed her,
hit the delivery man.

26:57.980 --> 27:00.005
So who is she?

27:02.350 --> 27:03.840
What is that?

27:03.890 --> 27:05.141
A triangle?

27:15.360 --> 27:17.419
BLAKE:
So you're the house mom here.

27:17.460 --> 27:18.666
WOMAN:
Yep.

27:18.700 --> 27:20.167
Well, tell us what happened.

27:20.200 --> 27:23.135
I heard gunfire,
and Ijust ran.

27:23.170 --> 27:24.660
And the police
never talked to you?

27:24.710 --> 27:26.837
No._ I read about it
in the paper,

27:26.870 --> 27:30.237
and I thought, wow,
I was, like, really close.

27:30.280 --> 27:33.044
So you're saying
he was aiming for me?

27:33.080 --> 27:34.240
We believe so.

27:34.280 --> 27:36.009
Oh, my God.

27:36.050 --> 27:37.711
Do you have any reason
to believe

27:37.750 --> 27:39.411
that anyone would want
to kill you?

27:39.450 --> 27:41.850
No.

27:41.890 --> 27:44.188
And you're sure
you don't recognize him?

27:49.100 --> 27:51.193
No. I've never seen him before.

27:55.200 --> 27:57.191
All four of them get pedicures
on occasion.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.730
Different salons.

27:58.770 --> 28:00.328
They'd all been
to Florida.

28:00.370 --> 28:02.907
Different cities,
20 years apart.

28:02.940 --> 28:05.147
Two of them
had master's degrees.

28:05.180 --> 28:07.239
All four of them
had dogs growing up.

28:08.280 --> 28:09.770
And the malice front?

28:09.820 --> 28:12.345
We're having a problem
finding Mangold,

28:12.390 --> 28:13.914
the detective in detox.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.359
They claim he's out
of the country.

28:15.390 --> 28:16.209
Alicia?

28:16.260 --> 28:17.784
ALICIA:
Yes. We think we should subpoena

28:17.830 --> 28:20.458
the CPD to produce
his service records.

28:20.490 --> 28:23.323
So you don't put
pork with cheese?

28:23.360 --> 28:26.067
Okay, but my guess is this
judge doesn't go for it.

28:26.100 --> 28:28.091
Anything else?

28:29.540 --> 28:31.201
This is weird.

28:31.240 --> 28:33.367
You said Meg Malden's birthday

28:33.410 --> 28:35.776
is two days
after Amelia Stevens'.

28:35.810 --> 28:38.347
Yes. Coincidence.

28:38.380 --> 28:40.940
Noreen Paulus: May 26.

28:40.980 --> 28:43.244
Lisa Rennick: June 19.

28:43.280 --> 28:44.383
What?

28:44.420 --> 28:46.342
They're all Geminis.

28:46.390 --> 28:47.448
DERRICK:
Okay.

28:47.490 --> 28:49.287
So you think he's
a Zodiac killer.

28:49.320 --> 28:51.288
You think he's killing Geminis.

28:56.300 --> 28:57.995
Where are you going?

28:58.030 --> 29:00.260
To ask him.

29:00.300 --> 29:02.097
And bacon, I guess.

29:02.140 --> 29:03.334
No bacon, right?

29:03.370 --> 29:05.133
PETER:
I think it's
about sovereignty.

29:05.170 --> 29:07.900
If, uh, we had as many
suicide bombers as Israel,

29:07.940 --> 29:09.874
we would have closed
our borders years ago.

29:09.910 --> 29:11.377
Exactly, and yet you have

29:11.410 --> 29:13.344
all these entertainers
boycotting Israel.

29:13.380 --> 29:15.848
Elvis Costello,
the Pixies.

29:15.880 --> 29:18.383
I think they'd welcome
that boycott.

29:18.420 --> 29:20.888
And are you
Jewish, too?
DAMIAN:
Me?

29:20.920 --> 29:22.319
No, I'm one of the good Germans.

29:23.420 --> 29:25.024
He's joking.

29:25.060 --> 29:25.981
(Damian chuckling)

29:27.390 --> 29:29.290
I met a very nice Jewish woman
at the market,

29:29.330 --> 29:32.868
and she'd just came back from
Israel, and she loved it.

29:32.900 --> 29:34.333
Yeah, the important thing
is that Peter

29:34.370 --> 29:36.531
has supported Israel for a
very long time, haven't you?

29:36.570 --> 29:37.935
And the gay agenda.

29:37.970 --> 29:41.076
GRACE:
What about the flotillas?

29:41.110 --> 29:42.930
What do you mean,
the flotillas?

29:42.980 --> 29:45.448
Israel's unprovoked attack
on the flotillas

29:45.480 --> 29:46.572
supplying aid to Gaza.

29:46.610 --> 29:48.419
SPENCER:
It wasn't unprovoked.

29:48.450 --> 29:49.269
Are you talking about Israel's

29:49.320 --> 29:50.981
justified sea blockade
against Hamas?

29:51.020 --> 29:52.180
Alicia, do you want
to get in here?

29:52.220 --> 29:54.814
I'm talking about the nine
people killed-- the activists.

29:54.860 --> 29:56.157
ELI:
The important thing
is, Spencer,

29:56.190 --> 29:58.420
that, uh, Peter
has worked tirelessly

29:58.460 --> 30:00.325
on hate crimes.
If you look at his record

30:00.360 --> 30:01.292
compared to Glenn Childs...

30:01.330 --> 30:04.219
And he loves the gays.
Okay, Owen. Thanks.

30:04.270 --> 30:06.420
JACKIE:
But the kosher thing
is different.

30:06.470 --> 30:09.132
It's not just
about pork, right?

30:11.410 --> 30:12.399
(sighs)

30:12.440 --> 30:14.237
How is it going
in there?

30:14.280 --> 30:15.304
Oh, great.

30:15.340 --> 30:16.500
It's one for the books.

30:17.540 --> 30:19.144
You're drinking a bit.

30:20.380 --> 30:22.348
Yep.

30:22.380 --> 30:26.487
I said that Peter was homophobic
because I wanted to hurt him.

30:26.520 --> 30:27.851
I know.

30:27.890 --> 30:29.482
Do you want to know why?

30:29.520 --> 30:30.555
If you want to say.

30:32.330 --> 30:34.992
You're living an idea, Alicia.

30:36.030 --> 30:38.169
You think society
is disintegrating.

30:38.200 --> 30:39.428
You don't want to get divorced

30:39.470 --> 30:40.391
'cause everyone
is divorcing.

30:40.430 --> 30:41.966
You're like that person

30:42.000 --> 30:43.900
on the Titanic
who won't leave their room

30:43.940 --> 30:45.362
because they're afraid
of being rude.

30:46.410 --> 30:47.604
You lost me.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.039
Do you love him?

30:49.080 --> 30:50.331
Do I love Peter?

30:50.380 --> 30:52.200
Yes, I do.

30:52.250 --> 30:53.308
I don't believe you.

30:53.350 --> 30:54.647
I can see it in your eyes.

30:54.680 --> 30:57.171
You don't love him--
not anymore.

30:57.220 --> 30:58.642
You don't see anything
in my eyes.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.158
Look, I get it.
You got kids.

31:01.190 --> 31:02.384
Just, you know,

31:02.420 --> 31:05.924
don't stay with him
if you don't love him.

31:08.430 --> 31:10.250
You know what I want, Owen?

31:10.300 --> 31:12.461
I want everyone
to stop worrying about me.

31:13.400 --> 31:15.960
Stop reviewing my life.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.060
I'm going to do what I want,
and it won't be what you want,

31:19.110 --> 31:21.101
and it won't be what
Mom wants, so back off.

31:33.390 --> 31:35.551
If you hurt her
again, I'll kill you.

31:37.590 --> 31:38.682
You know what?

31:38.730 --> 31:40.550
Go to hell.

31:40.590 --> 31:42.296
Oh, that's very adult.

31:42.330 --> 31:45.128
So, where were you?
What?

31:45.170 --> 31:47.422
The last time you saw your
sister was eight months ago.

31:47.470 --> 31:50.234
The last time you phoned
was August.

31:50.270 --> 31:51.430
Because you're still here.

31:51.470 --> 31:52.266
No, no.

31:52.310 --> 31:55.177
When I was in jail,
you visited once.

31:55.210 --> 31:56.529
She needed
your support.

31:56.580 --> 31:58.138
She needed her family.

31:58.180 --> 32:01.479
So, now I'm being lectured
to by the whoremonger.

32:01.520 --> 32:04.341
Yeah, that's right, and you're
going to listen to me.

32:04.390 --> 32:07.314
My wife deserves better
from her family.

32:07.350 --> 32:09.318
Now, you can hate me--
I really don't care--

32:09.360 --> 32:10.418
but you don't hurt her.

32:10.460 --> 32:13.429
You take the time to pick up
the phone and call her.

32:13.460 --> 32:14.529
You visit.

32:14.560 --> 32:17.324
If you don't have the money,
I will send it to you.

32:19.470 --> 32:21.233
Owen.

32:21.270 --> 32:23.534
Don't ever abandon her
like that again.

32:26.440 --> 32:27.600
GRACE:
It was my copy

32:27.640 --> 32:31.269
of Peace Not Apartheid,
not my mom's, not my dad's.

32:31.310 --> 32:33.608
What is with you kids and
your sentimentalizing of Hamas?

32:33.650 --> 32:35.208
JACKIE:
If you get marriage,

32:35.250 --> 32:36.569
you're still going
to just run around

32:36.620 --> 32:38.019
like little boys with
your pants down.

32:39.220 --> 32:41.051
I would like to make a toast.

32:42.190 --> 32:43.612
Zach, Grace,
you can use your water.

32:43.660 --> 32:45.287
Raise your glasses.

32:45.330 --> 32:47.218
Thank you all
for coming tonight.

32:47.260 --> 32:48.625
I've been told

32:48.660 --> 32:50.594
it isn't proper
to say "Happy Yom Kippur"

32:50.630 --> 32:52.359
because it is a day
of atonement,

32:52.400 --> 32:53.560
SO...

32:53.600 --> 32:56.535
everybody atone.

33:05.580 --> 33:08.378
Yeah, I don't
really have a lawyer.

33:08.420 --> 33:09.773
What can you do for me?

33:09.820 --> 33:12.618
You look different.

33:12.650 --> 33:13.742
Yeah.

33:13.790 --> 33:17.385
They won't let me
wear my hair in here.

33:17.420 --> 33:20.526
Can... can your law firm
do anything about that?

33:20.560 --> 33:25.224
Do you mind telling me your
date of birth, Mr. Landers?

33:25.270 --> 33:27.488
March 5, 1970.

33:27.530 --> 33:28.497
Why?

33:28.540 --> 33:30.599
Pisces.

33:30.640 --> 33:33.063
I'm a Gemini.

33:36.080 --> 33:38.571
Look, lady,
do you need something?

33:38.610 --> 33:40.544
Because I'm facing
life in prison here.

33:40.580 --> 33:42.275
Why did you do it?

33:42.320 --> 33:45.209
Why did you kill Geminis?

33:47.690 --> 33:49.157
(door opening)

33:49.190 --> 33:50.509
CARY:
Miss Sharma.

33:55.300 --> 33:57.552
You know you can't
do that, Kalinda.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.228
You'll be charged with impeding
an ongoing investigation.

34:00.270 --> 34:02.591
How're you liking the
prosecutor's office?

34:02.640 --> 34:05.438
It seems to
agree With you.

34:05.470 --> 34:06.607
You look taller.

34:06.640 --> 34:09.803
I like the moral clarity.

34:15.750 --> 34:17.377
Do you miss me?

34:17.420 --> 34:19.581
What if I said yes?

34:19.620 --> 34:22.657
Well, I'd say,
"That sounds about right."

34:24.390 --> 34:26.722
Then...

34:26.760 --> 34:29.092
yeah.

34:36.540 --> 34:38.508
DERRICK:
That's it.

34:38.540 --> 34:40.599
(indistinct chatter)

34:43.710 --> 34:44.677
Ijust...

34:44.710 --> 34:46.371
Hey.

34:46.410 --> 34:49.140
We're hitting
a brick wall.

34:49.180 --> 34:52.286
We think we should
amend the pleadings

34:52.320 --> 34:53.719
to include
Childs personally.

34:53.750 --> 34:55.684
Why?

34:55.720 --> 34:57.449
So we can depose him.

34:57.490 --> 34:59.549
Put him on the spot

34:59.590 --> 35:01.854
about the flaws in_ the_
Wyatt Stevens investigation.

35:01.900 --> 35:04.528
You want to turn up the heat?
DERRICK: Yes.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.526
I'm thinking I made a mistake

35:06.570 --> 35:08.731
backing away
from the political implications.

35:08.770 --> 35:12.604
That's what he fears--
the politics.

35:12.640 --> 35:14.130
So we make him afraid.

35:14.180 --> 35:17.502
And force a settlement.

35:18.810 --> 35:21.176
Okay.

35:33.790 --> 35:35.257
Oh, sure.
I recognize that guy.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.392
You do?

35:36.430 --> 35:38.660
I went on a date with him.

35:45.940 --> 35:47.237
This is absurd;
I have qualified immunity.

35:47.270 --> 35:48.237
No one _
has immunity

35:48.280 --> 35:49.770
from a deposition,
Mr. Childs.

35:49.810 --> 35:51.801
If you'd like, we can call
the judge to confirm.

35:51.850 --> 35:54.910
Let's keep this
amicable, shall we?

35:54.950 --> 35:56.645
Glenn has 15 minutes.

35:56.680 --> 35:57.942
Then he has
a conference call.

35:57.980 --> 36:00.915
If you agree
to 15 minutes,
we won't object.

36:00.950 --> 36:02.212
We agree.

36:02.260 --> 36:03.557
Good.

36:03.590 --> 36:04.659
Starting now.

36:04.690 --> 36:05.679
(door opens)

36:06.730 --> 36:08.357
You gotta be kidding me.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.799
No.

36:09.830 --> 36:11.149
We're not kidding.

36:17.970 --> 36:19.608
WENDY:
Okay.

36:19.640 --> 36:21.164
The clock is ticking.

36:30.320 --> 36:32.311
KALIN DA:
Hey, Cary.

36:32.350 --> 36:35.353
Mr. Moral Clarity.

36:36.590 --> 36:37.955
What is that?

36:37.990 --> 36:41.323
Evidence to help you
prosecute Carl Landers.

36:41.360 --> 36:42.122
Mm-hmm.

36:42.160 --> 36:43.855
Out of the goodness
of your heart?

36:43.900 --> 36:45.458
Oh, what do you care?

36:45.500 --> 36:48.389
You want moral clarity.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.567
Landers committed
all four murders.

36:50.600 --> 36:53.603
This will convict him.

37:00.380 --> 37:02.814
You were under intense pressure
to convict someone

37:02.850 --> 37:04.488
for the Northbrook killings,
weren't you?

37:04.520 --> 37:05.885
It's my job
to prosecute criminals.

37:05.920 --> 37:07.478
So, there's always pressure.

37:07.520 --> 37:09.681
Did you give
an interview on June 11th,

37:09.720 --> 37:13.451
promising "swift accountability
and justice" for the sniper?

37:13.490 --> 37:14.752
I don't recall.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.620
Chicago Tribune.
Op-Ed.

37:16.660 --> 37:18.696
"Chicagoans need not fear.

37:18.730 --> 37:20.493
This case will be solved
by the end of the month."

37:20.530 --> 37:21.963
And it was.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.934
A|__ICIA:
Even if corners
were cut?
They were not.

37:23.970 --> 37:25.961
You may not have been
aware that they were.

37:26.010 --> 37:27.307
This is my department.

37:27.340 --> 37:29.331
I have to be aware
of everything, and I am.

37:29.380 --> 37:31.348
Does that mean you approved
the covering up

37:31.380 --> 37:32.904
of the lead detective's
Vicodin addiction?

37:32.950 --> 37:34.975
There was no cover-up.
When were you informed

37:35.020 --> 37:36.817
of Detective Mangold's
drug addiction?

37:36.850 --> 37:39.683
June 28th, to be precise.

37:39.720 --> 37:42.609
And two days later, you had
Wyatt Stevens arrested.

37:42.660 --> 37:43.854
Ah, Wyatt Stevens was arrested

37:43.890 --> 37:45.357
because Wyatt Stevens
was guilty.

37:45.390 --> 37:47.950
So you stand by the prosecution
of Wyatt Stevens?

37:47.990 --> 37:49.526
I stand by every prosecution

37:49.560 --> 37:50.925
this office has taken on
in my tenure.

37:50.960 --> 37:53.827
Unlike earlier holders
of my office,

37:53.870 --> 37:56.964
I do not prosecute
without a good faith belief

37:57.000 --> 37:58.865
that the defendant is guilty.

37:58.910 --> 38:01.936
You're up for reelection,
isn't that correct, Mr. Childs?

38:01.980 --> 38:03.038
You know the answer to that.

38:03.080 --> 38:04.138
I'll take that
as a "yes."

38:04.180 --> 38:07.069
So you can't afford to get
this sniper case wrong?

38:07.110 --> 38:08.577
I didn't get it wrong.

38:08.620 --> 38:12.010
Were you aware that
all four sniper victims

38:12.050 --> 38:14.314
were members of datehearts.com?

38:16.060 --> 38:18.585
Is this deposition by ambush?

38:18.630 --> 38:20.586
ALICIA:
Were you aware
that all four victims

38:20.630 --> 38:22.325
were in contact

38:22.360 --> 38:23.793
with Carl Landers
from this site?

38:23.830 --> 38:27.095
That all four
ended up meeting him?

38:27.130 --> 38:29.735
And all four turned up dead
within days?

38:29.770 --> 38:31.738
That might prove problematic.

38:31.770 --> 38:33.704
One of those four victims
was a man.

38:33.740 --> 38:37.506
Limo surveillance video shows
that shooting was a miss.

38:37.540 --> 38:40.475
The intended victim was
a woman named Meg Malden.

38:40.510 --> 38:42.341
We have no proof
as to the veracity

38:42.380 --> 38:43.347
of these assertions.

38:43.380 --> 38:45.883
These are records

38:45.920 --> 38:48.115
subpoenaed from
datehearts.com.

38:48.150 --> 38:51.358
Affidavits asserting
that Carl Landers

38:51.390 --> 38:54.029
was in contact with
all of these women.

38:54.060 --> 38:55.948
They should have been
turned over to my office.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.126
It was.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.469
It was presented to
one of your ASAs.

38:59.500 --> 39:02.469
You weren't aware of that?

39:02.500 --> 39:04.866
You said you were aware of
everything about this case

39:04.910 --> 39:07.003
as it related to
your department.

39:07.040 --> 39:09.804
Unlike your predecessor.

39:09.840 --> 39:12.445
Okay. We'll have
to wrap this up.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.072
Glenn has that conference call.

39:14.110 --> 39:15.611
(sighs)

39:15.650 --> 39:17.538
Good day.

39:23.120 --> 39:24.428
(sighs)

39:24.460 --> 39:26.382
What was your ask?

39:26.430 --> 39:28.159
Originally or now?

39:28.190 --> 39:29.851
Now.

39:29.900 --> 39:31.868
But it comes with a gag order.

39:31.900 --> 39:33.868
Your client has_ to_|ive
With the ambigUIty

39:33.900 --> 39:35.390
of his father's name

39:35.440 --> 39:36.566
not being cleared.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.409
Can you sell that?

39:38.440 --> 39:39.862
You're in luck.

39:39.910 --> 39:41.605
He's here.

39:41.640 --> 39:42.937
All we can do is ask.

39:42.980 --> 39:45.175
How much?

39:45.210 --> 39:46.609
Four million.

39:48.110 --> 39:52.114
What you're seeing
is no reaction.

39:54.090 --> 39:56.411
Get your client to agree.

40:01.130 --> 40:03.155
(door opening)

40:03.200 --> 40:04.098
(door closing)

40:04.130 --> 40:05.893
ALICIA:
I don't know.

40:05.930 --> 40:07.420
He wants an apology.

40:07.470 --> 40:08.892
He wants his father's name
cleared.

40:08.940 --> 40:11.192
It was never about the money.

40:11.240 --> 40:13.458
DIANE:
See what you can do.

40:13.510 --> 40:15.501
Okay.

40:19.650 --> 40:21.618
(door opening)

40:34.130 --> 40:36.598
(shou '
tin '
Yes! g).

40:36.630 --> 40:38.029
DIANE:
Yep...

40:38.060 --> 40:41.496
predictable money.

40:44.940 --> 40:46.567
ALICIA:
What're you...?

40:47.610 --> 40:50.101
I thought your
plane was today.

40:50.140 --> 40:51.698
It was.
I'm late.

40:51.750 --> 40:53.001
Late?

40:53.050 --> 40:55.143
I think it-it's gone.

40:55.180 --> 40:58.889
I was reading Peter's
Gay/Straight Alliance speech,

40:58.920 --> 41:01.218
"The Double Danger
of Hate Crimes."

41:01.250 --> 41:04.253
It's pretty darn good.

41:04.290 --> 41:06.155
That's you, isn't it?

41:06.190 --> 41:07.851
You wrote that?

41:07.890 --> 41:09.221
No.

41:09.260 --> 41:13.526
Alicia, I can recognize
your cadence from a mile away.

41:13.570 --> 41:16.164
So you're Hillary?

41:16.200 --> 41:18.703
You're working your agenda
through him.

41:18.740 --> 41:21.163
We believe in the same
things, that's all.

41:26.810 --> 41:28.243
I'm sorry.

41:28.280 --> 41:30.077
For what?

41:30.120 --> 41:32.042
I wasn't here.

41:32.090 --> 41:34.240
You're in Oregon.

41:34.290 --> 41:36.986
I always thought of you
as the big sister.

41:37.020 --> 41:40.126
Well, I'm sorry that I wasn't
here when you needed me.

41:42.160 --> 41:43.957
I miss you.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.127
I know.

41:46.170 --> 41:48.730
No, you're supposed to say,
"I miss you, too."

41:48.770 --> 41:51.295
(laughing)

41:51.340 --> 41:53.535
I miss you, too.

41:53.570 --> 41:56.130
You don't need to be so strong.

41:58.110 --> 41:59.577
I'm not.

41:59.610 --> 42:02.010
I know.

42:02.050 --> 42:03.677
You don't need to pretend.

42:03.720 --> 42:06.018
Okay.

42:06.050 --> 42:07.586
(clears throat)

42:09.960 --> 42:11.279
(pats back)

42:21.200 --> 42:23.168
I like your apartment.

42:23.200 --> 42:25.168
Thanks.

42:30.610 --> 42:32.578
I'll phone.

42:32.610 --> 42:34.544
Okay.

42:40.920 --> 42:42.888
OWEN (outside):
I mean it.

42:42.920 --> 42:44.922
Okay.

42:47.790 --> 42:51.965
OWEN:
I'm waiting
for the elevator out here.

42:58.910 --> 43:01.606
I'll wait with you.
