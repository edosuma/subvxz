00:01.534 --> 00:03.114
<i>Previously on "Nashville"...</i>

00:03.115 --> 00:04.330
I don't want this.

00:04.331 --> 00:07.242
Mom, you have got to hear this
song Deacon and I just wrote.

00:07.243 --> 00:08.338
Luke: Maddie Claybourne, that is.

00:08.339 --> 00:10.889
- Rayna: We have a daughter together.
- I think I can get past this.

00:10.890 --> 00:12.809
You need a minute, and I need a few.

00:12.810 --> 00:15.017
This is a recording of my church solo.

00:15.018 --> 00:16.617
Have you ever worked as
a backup singer before?

00:16.618 --> 00:18.489
Gina: Reality TV can be a nightmare,

00:18.490 --> 00:20.809
unless you guys are working
with the right producers.

00:20.810 --> 00:23.722
We both know why this is
a terrible idea for you.

00:23.723 --> 00:25.618
Sometimes I really hate this town.

00:25.619 --> 00:27.882

really hate everything.</i>

[Whimpers]

00:42.907 --> 00:45.122
[Crying]

00:49.538 --> 00:52.449
Rayna: I can't tell you how happy
I am to be here with you today.

00:52.450 --> 00:55.450
Let's face it... radio is still
the best messenger out there

00:55.834 --> 00:57.346
to get the music out.

00:57.347 --> 00:59.489
Big Jim: Doing pretty
well on your own, ask me.

00:59.490 --> 01:01.953
That live stream you did
generated lots of call-ins.

01:01.954 --> 01:03.833
Oh, good. Well, that was planned.

01:03.834 --> 01:05.929
Piggybacking onto Luke
Wheeler's tour didn't hurt.

01:05.930 --> 01:07.241
[Chuckles] No, it did not.

01:07.242 --> 01:09.609
He's out on that morale tour
for the soldiers in Afghanistan,

01:09.610 --> 01:11.114
- isn't he?
- He is, yeah.

01:11.115 --> 01:12.370
Frankly, I would have
loved to have gone with him,

01:12.371 --> 01:13.738
but I felt like I needed to stay home

01:13.739 --> 01:15.859
and take care of the family, of course,

01:15.860 --> 01:18.300
but also, we've got this
album launching on may 1st.

01:18.301 --> 01:19.540
It's right around the corner.

01:19.541 --> 01:22.299
Listen, Rayna, you know
we all love your work,

01:22.300 --> 01:24.595
but I think... and I'm sure I speak

01:24.596 --> 01:27.099
for all the broadcast outfits
you've got here today...

01:27.100 --> 01:28.691
our listeners aren't too keen on you

01:28.692 --> 01:31.875
since you aligned yourself
with... Certain individuals.

01:31.876 --> 01:33.765
I'm assuming you mean Juliette Barnes.

01:34.085 --> 01:35.972
Listen, I-I signed her to the label

01:35.973 --> 01:37.652
'cause I think she's a talented performer

01:37.653 --> 01:39.837
and because she loves country music.

01:39.838 --> 01:41.725
Rob: That's hard to imagine,
being that she told everyone in it

01:41.726 --> 01:43.413
to go to hell in that song of hers.

01:43.414 --> 01:45.116
Oh, see, now, I don't see it that way.

01:45.117 --> 01:47.892
I, uh... I think she
was making a statement.

01:47.893 --> 01:50.573
But if you listen to "don't
put dirt on my grave just yet,"

01:50.901 --> 01:53.398
I think you'll agree with
me. It's a great song. It is.

01:53.399 --> 01:56.318
There's been a serious
accident in Afghanistan.

01:56.319 --> 01:59.261
Details are sketchy, but
I'm told Luke's hummer convoy

01:59.262 --> 02:00.998
was being escorted by private contractors

02:00.999 --> 02:02.742
when they hit an I.E.D.

02:02.743 --> 02:05.412
Luke was injured. His manager
just doesn't know how bad.

02:05.413 --> 02:06.484
So we don't know how he is?

02:06.485 --> 02:07.724
No, I've been trying to get information,

02:07.725 --> 02:09.340
but they're just not
releasing anything yet.

02:09.341 --> 02:10.675
And it hasn't even broken in the media.

02:10.676 --> 02:12.459
Can we get in touch with
him? I mean, where is he?

02:12.460 --> 02:14.052
He was taken to a hospital in Germany.

02:14.053 --> 02:16.420
They're flying him to New York.
He'll be hospitalized there.

02:16.421 --> 02:18.205
All right, then I want to go to New York.

02:19.085 --> 02:20.620
I want to be there when he lands.

02:20.621 --> 02:22.637
Okay. I'll get you on the
first available flight.

02:26.772 --> 02:27.685
You okay?

02:28.269 --> 02:29.845
No, I am not.

02:32.277 --> 02:33.644
- Hey.
- Scarlett: Hey.

02:33.645 --> 02:35.108
Just thought I'd bring you a little tea

02:35.109 --> 02:36.396
in the girliest cup I got.

02:36.397 --> 02:37.436
[Chuckling] Thanks.

02:37.437 --> 02:38.892
Didn't mean to interrupt your writing.

02:38.893 --> 02:40.844
Oh, you're not. I'm not
writing. I'm reading.

02:40.845 --> 02:42.716
It's my old journal from
when I first moved here.

02:42.717 --> 02:44.212
Yeah, a lot's happened since then.

02:44.213 --> 02:46.284
- A lot un-happened,
too. - Yeah.

02:46.653 --> 02:48.052
It's funny... I thought I'd feel better

02:48.053 --> 02:50.149
being off the road, being free,

02:50.541 --> 02:52.796
but trouble is, now I don't
know what to do with myself.

02:52.797 --> 02:54.558
Well, you just pick up where you left off.

02:59.333 --> 03:00.604
Will: So, just to be clear,

03:00.605 --> 03:03.092
none of this is gonna make
me look like a jackass, right?

03:03.093 --> 03:05.260
Oh, stop it. That's not possible.

03:05.261 --> 03:06.268
He's the best.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.765
Okay, you two, save it for the camera.

03:07.766 --> 03:09.549
Uh, t-these things aren't on yet, right?

03:09.550 --> 03:12.317
No, but before they are, I
need you to sign a release form.

03:12.318 --> 03:13.789
Gunnar Scott, right? The songwriter?

03:13.790 --> 03:16.196
Oh, ye... I-I'm not actually
involved in this. [Chuckles]

03:16.197 --> 03:17.732
Lots of free publicity in it for you.

03:17.733 --> 03:19.728
I'm not one for reality
shows. [Cellphone ringing]

03:19.729 --> 03:22.592
Don't find much reality
[Chuckles] in them, you know?

03:23.112 --> 03:24.303
[Ringing continues]

03:24.304 --> 03:26.871
Could you maybe silence this next time?

03:26.872 --> 03:28.215
I work nights.

03:28.216 --> 03:29.619
<i>And my phone is what woke you up?</i>

03:29.987 --> 03:31.290
[Cellphone beeps]

03:31.291 --> 03:32.427
Hey, Jeanne.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.435
Wow.

03:35.235 --> 03:37.971
That... that is quite the opportunity.

03:38.891 --> 03:40.011
Sure.

03:40.315 --> 03:41.499
All right. All right, bye.

03:41.835 --> 03:43.002
[Cellphone beeps]

03:43.003 --> 03:44.306
That was my publisher.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.202
Uh, Juliette Barnes wants
to meet with me tonight

03:46.203 --> 03:48.642
to discuss co-writes for her new album.

03:48.643 --> 03:50.381
<i>Why are you saying that
like it's a bad thing?</i>

03:50.382 --> 03:53.809
Come here. Come here.

03:54.344 --> 03:57.031
Because I saw her and Jeff Fordham

03:57.032 --> 03:59.935
sneak out of the screening room
at the BMI party last night.

03:59.936 --> 04:01.895
So, they watched a movie?

04:01.896 --> 04:03.783
Yeah, only it was NC-17,

04:03.784 --> 04:05.479
and they were both starring in it.

04:05.480 --> 04:06.791
Seriously?!

04:06.792 --> 04:08.915
I mean, how am I supposed
to talk to Avery about this,

04:08.916 --> 04:10.643
let alone try and write with her?

04:10.644 --> 04:11.651
You haven't told him?

04:11.652 --> 04:14.051
<i>No! I mean, would you want to know?</i>

04:14.052 --> 04:15.140
Yes!

04:15.829 --> 04:16.892
No.

04:17.577 --> 04:18.868
I don't know.

04:21.507 --> 04:22.771
Thank you for getting here so quick.

04:22.772 --> 04:23.947
Of course. I'm happy to help.

04:23.948 --> 04:26.363
All right, girls. So, how long
are you gonna be there, again?

04:26.364 --> 04:27.499
Just one night, sweetie.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.219
I hope he's not hurt too badly.

04:29.220 --> 04:30.595
<i>Mom, you said he wasn't.</i>

04:30.596 --> 04:32.507
He's gonna be fine, y'all.
He's gonna be all right.

04:32.508 --> 04:33.363
- You all set?
- Yes.

04:33.364 --> 04:35.311
Listen, I think we need another backpack.

04:35.312 --> 04:36.407
- Daphne.
- That one's mine.

04:36.408 --> 04:37.911
- Whoops.
- All right. Let's do that quickly.

04:37.912 --> 04:39.119
Okay, do you have everything you need?

04:39.120 --> 04:40.271
- I do. Um...
- Okay.

04:40.272 --> 04:42.378
Would it be cool if I actually

04:42.379 --> 04:44.539
spent the night with Deacon tonight, maybe?

04:44.540 --> 04:45.395
Honey.

04:45.396 --> 04:46.531
I-I-I don't think
that's a good idea...

04:46.532 --> 04:47.843
not under the circumstances.

04:47.844 --> 04:50.467
I mean, we've... we've talked
about having a sleepover before.

04:50.468 --> 04:51.387
Why not tonight?

04:51.388 --> 04:53.356
<i>Because you and your
sister are staying with me.</i>

04:54.036 --> 04:55.651
All right, don't you
think that I should be able

04:55.652 --> 04:57.099
to spend just a little bit more time

04:57.100 --> 04:59.139
than, you know, an hour a week with him?

04:59.140 --> 05:00.339
I think it's a conversation
we need to have,

05:00.340 --> 05:01.451
and now's not the time to have it.

05:01.452 --> 05:03.451
Exactly. Your mother and I
need to talk about that first.

05:03.452 --> 05:04.763
And, besides, I was looking forward

05:04.764 --> 05:06.060
to spending some time with you.

05:06.747 --> 05:08.755
Dad, you know I love you. I do.

05:08.756 --> 05:10.274
I just... I just want to spend

05:10.275 --> 05:11.811
<i>a little more time with him, you know?</i>

05:12.260 --> 05:13.404
That's all.

05:13.988 --> 05:15.500
I've got a plane to catch, guys.

05:16.436 --> 05:17.468
Please?

05:18.445 --> 05:20.355
- Fine.
- Thank you!

05:20.356 --> 05:21.836
- Ready, daddy.
- Okay, let's go, honey.

05:23.208 --> 05:24.184
You all right with that?

05:24.656 --> 05:26.272
<i>[Chuckles] As much as I can be.</i>

05:27.072 --> 05:28.391
I'll drop her off, okay?

05:28.392 --> 05:29.359
Okay.

05:30.440 --> 05:31.296
[Avery sighs]

05:31.633 --> 05:33.815
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:33.816 --> 05:36.440
- How long you been here?
- Uh, I just let myself in.

05:37.889 --> 05:39.408
I was here last night, too.

05:40.101 --> 05:42.606
Stayed pretty late before I
gave up on you coming home.

05:43.173 --> 05:44.333
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:44.334 --> 05:46.078
It was such a mob getting out of there.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.366
It just took me forever.

05:48.046 --> 05:50.806
Look, I know things have been...

05:51.638 --> 05:54.517
Kind of off between us lately.

05:54.518 --> 05:55.557
No, they haven't.

05:55.558 --> 05:58.709
I just want to apologize for my role in it.

05:59.501 --> 06:02.261
I-I was trying so hard to help Scarlett

06:02.262 --> 06:03.702
that I-I didn't really stop

06:04.054 --> 06:06.366
and think how it might look to you.

06:08.142 --> 06:09.438
I'm sorry.

06:10.262 --> 06:11.550
Thank you.

06:12.142 --> 06:14.476
<i>Scarlett is my ex-girlfriend.</i>

06:14.477 --> 06:15.733
I know.

06:15.734 --> 06:17.462
You're the one I'm in love with.

06:22.022 --> 06:23.149
Mm.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.846
Ohh, I have so many meetings. I'm so late.

06:26.766 --> 06:27.701
Good.

06:27.702 --> 06:29.908
Then being a little later won't
make much difference, will it?

06:29.909 --> 06:33.824
[Sighs] You know, I
wish it wouldn't, but...

06:35.808 --> 06:37.160
Are you still mad at me?

06:38.160 --> 06:39.415
We're fine.

06:39.863 --> 06:41.031
Really.

06:41.343 --> 06:43.535
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

07:05.721 --> 07:07.450
Hey, Rayna. You go right on in.

07:16.073 --> 07:17.809
Rayna, what are you doing here?

07:18.281 --> 07:19.368
Are you okay?

07:19.369 --> 07:20.680
I-I'm fine.

07:20.681 --> 07:22.665
They said you hit an I.E.D.

07:22.666 --> 07:25.785
No, the first Humvee in the convoy did.

07:25.786 --> 07:26.872
I was in the second.

07:26.873 --> 07:29.489
When we swerved to avoid it, we rolled.

07:29.913 --> 07:31.201
Two people died.

07:31.593 --> 07:32.640
Oh, my God.

07:32.641 --> 07:34.168
Yeah, two others are seriously injured.

07:34.169 --> 07:37.601
I just got a couple
bruised ribs and a few cuts

07:38.066 --> 07:40.033
and a pretty good bump on the noggin.

07:40.034 --> 07:41.401
I was lucky.

07:41.402 --> 07:42.753
You're not going back there.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.056
<i>Yeah, well, I am going back.</i>

07:44.057 --> 07:45.713
I just don't know when right now.

07:46.777 --> 07:48.713
I got to be honest with you... it...

07:50.170 --> 07:51.977
It shook me up pretty good...

07:52.505 --> 07:54.305
in ways I wouldn't expect.

07:54.306 --> 07:55.538
Yeah, I bet.

07:56.178 --> 07:57.330
But you know what?

07:58.778 --> 08:01.505
Right now, I really
just want me some sugar.

08:02.617 --> 08:03.597
- Come here.
- Mm.

08:04.477 --> 08:07.134
- I'm so glad you're okay.
- I'm glad you're here.

08:07.486 --> 08:08.989
Me too. [Chuckles]

08:08.990 --> 08:10.309
Gina: Just forget you're being watched.

08:10.310 --> 08:11.821
Forget the cameras are even here,

08:11.822 --> 08:14.242
and be yourselves, dirty drawers and all.

08:14.243 --> 08:15.106
Whoa, whoa.

08:15.107 --> 08:17.290
Thought we agreed... no cameras
in the bedroom or bathroom.

08:17.291 --> 08:19.106
Ha ha. Very funny. Keep it up.

08:19.107 --> 08:20.307
And have fun with this, you two.

08:20.308 --> 08:21.731
Great. Let's do this.

08:21.732 --> 08:23.733
And remember, just do
whatever you'd ordinarily do.

08:23.734 --> 08:24.574
Okay?

08:25.086 --> 08:26.414
Okay, roll camera.

08:26.838 --> 08:28.166
Are you ready to be your sweet self?

08:28.167 --> 08:29.062
Will: Yep.

08:29.414 --> 08:31.701
And to kick this thing
off on the right foot,

08:31.702 --> 08:35.167
I've got a brand-new song
for my brand-new wife,

08:35.168 --> 08:37.711
who came into my life
at just the right moment

09:28.288 --> 09:30.612
but ever since Scarlett's meltdown,

09:30.613 --> 09:32.781
Juliet's been kind of distant.

09:32.782 --> 09:34.750
I mean, she says she's fine, but...

09:35.583 --> 09:37.110
You sure it's about Scarlett?

09:37.950 --> 09:39.782
Can't imagine what else it'd be.

09:40.998 --> 09:45.117
I just... I hate feeling like
she doesn't trust me, you know?

09:45.798 --> 09:48.933
I think this might be, like,
a question for Gunnar...

09:48.934 --> 09:50.374
like, a guy thing.

09:51.423 --> 09:53.173
- Hey!
- Scarlett: Hi.

09:53.174 --> 09:54.581
You look great. Oh, thanks. [Chuckles]

09:54.582 --> 09:55.621
How you feeling?

09:55.622 --> 09:57.030
Good. Fine. Um...

09:58.478 --> 10:00.428
Really, I'm fine. [Laughs]

10:00.429 --> 10:03.077
Uh, just wanted to ask you if
I could stay with you tonight.

10:03.078 --> 10:04.813
Maddie's at Deacon's, and
I don't want to impose.

10:04.814 --> 10:06.325
- Hell yeah.
- Thanks.

10:06.326 --> 10:08.073
We'll bust out the karaoke machine.

10:08.074 --> 10:09.585
I don't know if I'm up
for singing just yet.

10:09.586 --> 10:11.841
Right. Then we'll just watch movies.

10:11.842 --> 10:13.897
Or you could stay here and wait tables.

10:13.898 --> 10:15.522
Your hands seem to want to.

10:16.122 --> 10:17.082
[Chuckles]

10:18.737 --> 10:20.160
Old habits die hard.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.696
You did work here a while.

10:21.697 --> 10:23.490
You think Erika would
let me come in sometime,

10:24.442 --> 10:25.800
fill in just for fun?

10:25.801 --> 10:27.801
You really want to put that apron back on?

10:27.802 --> 10:30.666
No, I just want to get back
to normal... whatever that is.

10:31.018 --> 10:32.440
Juliette: Thank you. Appreciate it.

10:32.441 --> 10:34.648
Terrific meeting. Thanks
so much for coming by.

10:34.649 --> 10:35.737
We'll be in touch.

[Sighs]

10:38.346 --> 10:39.474
Good songwriter.

10:40.114 --> 10:42.818
Seems to really have a handle
on how we're... Evolving.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.043
How many more of these things do we have?

10:46.634 --> 10:48.073
Listen, if you're not feeling this,

10:48.074 --> 10:49.816
we can cancel for the rest of today.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.449
In the meantime, you
write songs with Avery.

10:53.337 --> 10:55.417
No. Don't worry about it. It's fine.

10:55.418 --> 10:57.073
Let's just keep going.

10:57.074 --> 10:58.698
- You sure?
- Yeah. Let's go.

10:58.699 --> 11:03.134
Okay. All right, next up, we have...

11:03.135 --> 11:05.381
- Hey.
- Gunnar Scott.

11:05.382 --> 11:06.910
Well, I know who you are.

11:07.302 --> 11:09.354
Although, I don't think
we've ever actually met.

11:09.355 --> 11:11.363
No. It's... it's a pleasure. [Chuckles]

11:11.771 --> 11:13.866
I was in a... I was in
a band with her boyfriend.

11:13.867 --> 11:16.194
Ah! Who's a... you know,
he's a... he's a great guy.

11:16.195 --> 11:17.411
He's... he's really a...

11:17.723 --> 11:19.674
he's a great person, you know... Avery.

11:19.675 --> 11:21.178
- Yes, he is.
- Mm.

11:21.179 --> 11:22.374
I couldn't agree more. [Chuckles]

11:22.375 --> 11:24.174
You know, he, uh, played me the song

11:24.175 --> 11:25.590
that you guys recorded in my studio,

11:25.591 --> 11:26.629
and it sounded great.

11:26.630 --> 11:28.485
You got two more on the
charts, is that right?

11:28.486 --> 11:30.494
I do, yeah. Uh, one is mine.

11:30.495 --> 11:32.102
The other is a... is a co-write, so...

11:32.103 --> 11:34.270
- I'm happy to work however you want.
- That's great.

11:34.271 --> 11:36.079
Juliette Barnes and Gunnar Scott.

11:37.055 --> 11:38.199
Quite the combo.

11:38.567 --> 11:41.561
I happened to be next door,
checking out a new act.

11:41.562 --> 11:44.233
Thought I'd stop by, say hello.

11:44.234 --> 11:45.881
If you don't mind, we're in the
middle of a meeting right now,

11:45.882 --> 11:47.617
- so maybe we can...
- can you give us just two secs?

11:47.618 --> 11:49.259
- Do you mind? I'm sorry.
- Oh, no, no, sure.

11:49.571 --> 11:50.858
Glenn: Come on, Gunnar. Jeff.

11:50.859 --> 11:51.875
Gunnar.

11:57.875 --> 12:00.226
Deacon: What in the world
is this you are studying?

12:00.227 --> 12:03.283
Like, nuclear quantum physics or something?

12:03.284 --> 12:04.747
[Chuckles] It's algebra 2.

12:04.748 --> 12:07.091
Oh. There's a sequel.

12:07.092 --> 12:08.499
[Both chuckle]

12:08.500 --> 12:09.635
I never studied that.

12:09.636 --> 12:11.043
Well, you were very lucky.

12:12.299 --> 12:13.994
I sure would have loved
to have a mom and dad

12:13.995 --> 12:15.979
make me study and stuff like that.

12:15.980 --> 12:17.844
Really? What was your childhood like?

12:18.668 --> 12:20.404
Well, I didn't really have much of one.

12:20.836 --> 12:21.803
It's okay, though.

12:21.804 --> 12:23.507
That's probably why I
act like a child nowadays.

12:23.508 --> 12:24.812
Is that why you never got married?

12:26.075 --> 12:27.938
Answer to that one is, uh...

12:27.939 --> 12:30.091
More complicated than
that math you're doing.

12:31.380 --> 12:33.932
So you get back to that, and
I'll get back to my lasagna.

12:34.612 --> 12:36.700
Did you ever think about marrying my mom?

12:39.492 --> 12:41.634
Do you... Smell smo...

12:41.635 --> 12:43.107
oh, no, no, no!

12:43.451 --> 12:44.659
Ohh!

12:45.491 --> 12:48.028
[Groans] Damn it!

12:49.060 --> 12:50.347
Darn it.

12:50.348 --> 12:51.524

12:53.692 --> 12:55.467
<i>Reporter: The convoy
suffered two fatalities,</i>

were taken out of Afghanistan,</i>

<i>Among those musicians...</i>

13:03.556 --> 13:06.003
[TV shuts off] Is Luke Wheeler,
who hightailed it out of there

13:06.004 --> 13:08.299
before he could give those soldiers
the show they were promised.

13:08.300 --> 13:10.219
You didn't have any choice in that matter.

13:10.220 --> 13:11.419
- Mm.
- I know you're disappointed.

13:11.420 --> 13:14.075
<i>I am disappointed. Those
people are heroes to me.</i>

13:14.076 --> 13:16.242
They put their lives on the line,

13:16.243 --> 13:17.490
and I sing songs for a living.

13:17.491 --> 13:18.730
Now they're all gonna get stiffed,

13:18.731 --> 13:21.866
'cause we were gonna simulcast
to posts all over the world.

13:21.867 --> 13:23.050
[Grunts]

13:23.051 --> 13:24.322
Hey, you know what?

13:24.323 --> 13:26.811
Fort Campbell is right
outside of Nashville...

13:26.812 --> 13:28.227
30,000 troops there.

13:28.228 --> 13:30.875
<i>Why don't you just go do
the show for those guys,</i>

13:30.876 --> 13:32.882
and then we can simulcast it overseas?

13:32.883 --> 13:34.499
Well, it'd be hard to do in a hurry,

13:35.043 --> 13:37.658
and I don't know if I have
a whole show in me, either.

13:37.659 --> 13:38.755
Well, I'd help.

13:39.155 --> 13:40.659
And, listen, we put the word out,

13:40.660 --> 13:42.171
I'm sure there are a ton
of people in this town

13:42.172 --> 13:43.467
who would love to do it.

13:43.468 --> 13:44.851
Don't you have an album to launch?

13:44.852 --> 13:45.891
I do.

13:45.892 --> 13:47.675
But, you know, those guys are my fans, too.

13:48.900 --> 13:49.995
Come here.

13:50.796 --> 13:51.891
[Chuckles]

13:54.876 --> 13:56.603
I can't stop thinking about you.

13:56.604 --> 13:57.540
Don't.

13:58.068 --> 14:00.163
[Chuckles] Not like that.

14:00.164 --> 14:01.555
<i>Well, a little like that.</i>

14:01.556 --> 14:03.754
I mean, given our newfound intimacy.

14:03.755 --> 14:05.466
I was drunk, okay?

14:05.467 --> 14:06.954
Very, very drunk.

14:06.955 --> 14:08.258
Right.

14:08.259 --> 14:09.914
Well, regardless, I feel like now

14:09.915 --> 14:12.875
is a good time for us to
be... Honest with each other.

14:12.876 --> 14:15.291
You see, when I came after
you to re-sign you to Edgehill,

14:15.292 --> 14:17.268
it was because Howie V. Was right.

14:17.946 --> 14:20.678
You are poised to cross
over in a major way.

14:20.679 --> 14:21.798
The only thing I'm poised to do

14:21.799 --> 14:23.887
is release a country album with Highway 65.

14:23.888 --> 14:25.287
- That's it.
- Why?

14:25.288 --> 14:27.578
Rayna doesn't have the
money or the resources

14:27.579 --> 14:29.771
to help you with your
career or anything else.

14:29.772 --> 14:31.579
So what exactly is she doing for you?

14:31.580 --> 14:34.275
Well, for one thing, she's
giving me freedom musically.

14:34.580 --> 14:36.147
Hey. Hey, hey. I just got a call.

14:36.587 --> 14:38.826
Rayna wants you to play day
after tomorrow at Fort Campbell

14:38.827 --> 14:40.338
for some army personnel and their families

14:40.339 --> 14:41.626
with Luke and Kellie Pickler.

14:41.627 --> 14:43.027
But I need an answer ASAP.

14:43.028 --> 14:43.819
I'm in.

14:43.820 --> 14:44.828
Okay. I'll make the arrangements.

14:47.853 --> 14:50.004
What, you think some
empty patriotic gesture

14:50.005 --> 14:51.164
is gonna help your career?

14:51.165 --> 14:52.692
It's not about my career.

14:52.693 --> 14:53.789
Listen to me.

14:54.357 --> 14:56.541
I am not giving up on getting you back.

14:56.542 --> 14:57.501
Well, you should,

14:57.502 --> 15:00.302
because that's never,
ever gonna happen again.

15:01.246 --> 15:02.942
I meant at Edgehill, darling.

15:03.246 --> 15:05.364
But it's too bad about the other thing.

15:05.365 --> 15:06.373
It was fun.

15:22.026 --> 15:23.257
Good morning.

15:23.258 --> 15:24.938
Oh, hey. Listen, I got some good news.

15:24.939 --> 15:27.266
Your mama called. She
said Luke is gonna be fine.

15:27.267 --> 15:28.053
Oh, thank goodness.

15:28.054 --> 15:29.970
Yeah, they're getting ready
to discharge him right now.

15:29.971 --> 15:31.172
So, are they coming home tonight, then?

15:31.173 --> 15:33.084
Almost. They're gonna
stop off at Fort Campbell.

15:33.085 --> 15:34.027
They're gonna do a little show there

15:34.028 --> 15:35.307
for the troops and their families,

15:35.308 --> 15:37.155
but that's only about an hour away.

15:37.156 --> 15:38.052
Okay.

15:38.428 --> 15:39.363
What do you got there?

15:39.364 --> 15:40.395
Oh, I found this in the hall.

15:40.731 --> 15:42.146
So, you know Merle Haggard?

15:42.147 --> 15:43.395
[Laughs] Well, yeah.

15:44.500 --> 15:46.920
I did a couple shows with
Merle back in the day.

15:52.473 --> 15:53.349
Hey, let me get you some cereal, all right?

15:53.350 --> 15:54.392
Okay, thank you.

15:54.393 --> 15:55.266
I won't burn it.

15:55.946 --> 15:56.930
[Laughs]

15:57.912 --> 15:59.159
If it's all right with my dad

15:59.160 --> 16:01.343
and if my mom isn't
coming home until later,

16:01.711 --> 16:03.806
you think that I can spend
another night here with you?

16:03.807 --> 16:06.030
Kidding me? If it's okay with
them, you stay as long as you want.

16:06.031 --> 16:07.486

Sweetie, I want you to
listen to me a second.

16:16.670 --> 16:19.229
Your mama... she deserved
better than me back then.

16:20.702 --> 16:21.990
So did you.

16:22.414 --> 16:25.004
From what I remember, I wasn't
around that much, anyway.

16:25.005 --> 16:26.645
What about the day I was born?

16:27.606 --> 16:29.061
Do you remember where you were then?

16:30.854 --> 16:32.077
Yeah. Yeah.

you the least bit concerned

Nah. She's gonna behave herself here.

I wish you hadn't included her.

17:23.063 --> 17:24.949
I don't think Juliette
deserves to be a part of it.

17:24.950 --> 17:26.229
Juliette: Is that right?

17:26.230 --> 17:27.829
Would you prefer I didn't perform?

17:28.903 --> 17:29.772
Hey.

17:29.773 --> 17:31.140
If I had my druthers.

17:31.141 --> 17:33.341
You don't want me on
your stage, I won't be.

17:34.157 --> 17:35.221
Juliette.

17:36.159 --> 17:37.493
What... I don't...

17:37.494 --> 17:38.878
Hey! How are you?

17:39.532 --> 17:41.238
- How are you?
- Uh, good.

17:41.830 --> 17:44.245
Ahh! And here we are!

17:44.246 --> 17:46.532
[Laughing] Home, sweet home.

17:46.533 --> 17:47.421
[Chuckles]

17:50.563 --> 17:51.491
Gina: You know what?

17:51.938 --> 17:53.363
Let's try that again.

17:53.739 --> 17:54.938
It's feeling a little canned.

17:54.939 --> 17:56.754
It's 'cause we've done it 10 times.

17:56.755 --> 17:58.330
There's always room for improvement, right?

17:58.331 --> 18:00.626
Look, bottom line... we need
to believe what we're seeing,

18:00.627 --> 18:02.323
and the kiss is falling flat.

18:02.659 --> 18:04.986
So if you two need to take a minute,

18:04.987 --> 18:07.378
step into the bedroom, do
whatever it is you need to,

18:07.379 --> 18:10.171
come back out, try it
again, it's fine by me.

18:10.619 --> 18:12.514
Okay, sure. Yeah. Just
give us a few minutes.

18:12.515 --> 18:13.946
No, no, you know what? I'm sorry.

18:13.947 --> 18:15.675
I-I can't do this anymore.

18:16.555 --> 18:17.755
Not today.

18:20.355 --> 18:21.690
What was that all about?

18:21.691 --> 18:23.410
I mean, I know you're not the
biggest Juliette Barnes fan,

18:23.411 --> 18:24.618
but come on, now.

18:24.619 --> 18:26.827
Why are you so hot on Juliette being here?

18:27.131 --> 18:29.378
Because she's a good performer.

18:29.379 --> 18:30.754
And the military loves her.

18:30.755 --> 18:33.083
They don't care about
her past bad behavior.

18:33.835 --> 18:34.635
Yeah.

18:36.067 --> 18:37.162
What?

18:37.163 --> 18:38.857
Is that what this is really all about?

18:38.858 --> 18:39.994
<i>Is that what what's all about?</i>

18:39.995 --> 18:41.642
All this, organizing this concert...

18:41.643 --> 18:44.658
w-w-was it for me or
was it for the army

18:44.659 --> 18:46.595
or is it to promote your label?

18:47.395 --> 18:50.282
Okay. All right, now
you're just being mean.

18:50.283 --> 18:51.554
- I'm sorry, Rayna. I meant...
- no, no, no.

18:51.555 --> 18:52.946
You know, you're not the only one who wants

18:52.947 --> 18:54.419
to give back to the people who serve us.

18:54.755 --> 18:57.022
I wanted to do this because
I care about the military,

18:57.023 --> 18:57.854
I care about these families,

18:57.855 --> 18:59.494
<i>but mostly 'cause I care about you.</i>

18:59.495 --> 19:01.230
And as far as Juliette
goes, for the record,

19:01.231 --> 19:03.214
I think she would be a great
addition to this lineup.

19:03.215 --> 19:06.646
<i>But... This is your show, babe, all right?</i>

19:06.647 --> 19:08.758
So you do with Juliette what you will.

19:08.759 --> 19:09.702
- Hey, Rayna?
- Yeah?

19:09.703 --> 19:11.619
I wanted to go over the
final lineup with you.

19:11.620 --> 19:13.891
You know what? Luke's gonna be
handling that from now on, all right?

19:13.892 --> 19:15.212
<i>You can talk to him. Thanks.</i>

19:21.958 --> 19:23.505
So, are we leaving right now?

19:24.189 --> 19:26.061
He can keep me from going up onstage,

19:26.062 --> 19:27.465
but I'm here to support the troops,

19:27.466 --> 19:29.326
<i>and he can't stop me
from doing that, can he?</i>

19:29.327 --> 19:31.059
Hey, y'all. Mind if I join you?

19:31.060 --> 19:32.496
Wow. You're Juliette Barnes.

19:32.497 --> 19:34.091
<i>I am. And who are you?</i>

19:34.092 --> 19:35.730
Staff Sergeant Alex Gaines.

19:35.731 --> 19:36.711
Nice to meet you.

19:36.712 --> 19:37.967
So, what are you singing tomorrow?

19:38.672 --> 19:41.401
Uh, I'm not... Performing, actually.

19:41.402 --> 19:43.169
Well, then, why are you here? [Chuckles]

19:43.170 --> 19:44.636
<i>I mean, I'm happy you are, but...</i>

19:46.013 --> 19:47.711
Uh... You want to know why?

19:48.380 --> 19:51.938
My dad was actually a black hawk pilot.

19:52.396 --> 19:54.182
Lived at Fort Rucker till I was 3.

19:54.721 --> 19:56.495
Where'd you get stationed after that?

19:56.496 --> 19:57.842
We didn't.

19:57.843 --> 20:00.969
He, uh... He was killed
in a training accident

20:00.970 --> 20:02.233
when I was 4.

20:02.234 --> 20:04.070
- That's young.
- Yeah.

20:04.071 --> 20:07.254
But I have all these great memories of him.

20:07.627 --> 20:09.266
I remember his flag tattoo

20:10.065 --> 20:12.856
and that he used to make all
these little paper cranes.

20:12.857 --> 20:14.670
And every time he'd tuck me into bed,

20:14.671 --> 20:16.602
he always reminded me of the army motto.

20:16.603 --> 20:18.205
"This we'll defend."

20:18.206 --> 20:19.559
"This we'll defend."

20:20.235 --> 20:22.499
I always felt very safe when he was home.

20:23.368 --> 20:25.994
I appreciate your service
and your sacrifice.

20:25.995 --> 20:26.887
Thanks.

20:34.177 --> 20:36.840
It's funny... I've been called
a lot of things in my life...

20:36.841 --> 20:37.932
"Freakin' Deacon."

20:38.629 --> 20:39.809
Too often, it's other things,

20:39.810 --> 20:43.496
like..."Damn drunk" or "loser"

20:43.497 --> 20:44.752
or "the defendant."

20:44.753 --> 20:45.949
[Laughter]

20:46.557 --> 20:49.175
Anyway, lately, there's a new
name that I've been called,

20:49.176 --> 20:52.022
and it's, uh, taken me
some getting used to...

20:53.986 --> 20:55.362
"dad."

20:55.844 --> 20:57.300
This morning, my daughter asked me

20:57.301 --> 21:00.990
where I was the night she was born.

21:01.487 --> 21:03.431
I told her I was on the road.

21:07.908 --> 21:10.446
Truth is, I was on the road to hell.

21:10.447 --> 21:11.877
See, I had been in recovery.

21:11.878 --> 21:14.226
I was staying right he at this sober house.

21:14.227 --> 21:15.922
I was doing pretty good,
but when I found out

21:15.923 --> 21:17.494
that the woman I loved was having a baby

21:17.495 --> 21:19.915
with... Another man,

21:19.916 --> 21:22.108
well, I walked right out the front door,

21:22.109 --> 21:23.922
and I went to the nearest bar.

21:23.923 --> 21:25.309
<i>I had one drink...</i>

21:25.834 --> 21:27.221
20 times.

21:27.222 --> 21:28.549
[Laughter]

21:28.550 --> 21:30.453
So, where was I

21:30.759 --> 21:34.785
the night my beautiful, little
baby girl was being born?

21:40.917 --> 21:42.751
I have no idea.

21:43.099 --> 21:44.604
Probably in some fleabag motel

21:44.605 --> 21:46.721
with some woman whose name I'll never know.

21:47.327 --> 21:48.412
[Sniffles]

21:49.549 --> 21:51.115
And I'm gonna have to live with that.

21:52.884 --> 21:55.671
But that doesn't mean I need
to tell my daughter that.

21:57.302 --> 21:58.768
So, uh...

22:01.226 --> 22:03.031
I was on the road.

22:04.937 --> 22:06.423
[Grunting] Whoa.

22:06.424 --> 22:07.882
You're working it pretty hard. Hey.

22:08.440 --> 22:10.435
Try slowing it down, all right?

22:11.199 --> 22:12.825
Form's uneven.

22:13.840 --> 22:14.859
[Breathing heavily] Thanks.

22:14.860 --> 22:16.757
I'm just blowing off some steam, I guess.

22:17.508 --> 22:18.658
Yeah, well, don't do it too hard.

22:18.659 --> 22:20.432
You know, you did sign
that liability waiver.

22:20.433 --> 22:21.511
[Chuckles]

22:21.901 --> 22:24.392
No worries. I'm not the litigious type.

22:24.393 --> 22:25.503
[Thud]

22:25.857 --> 22:27.422
You're gonna be the
"just hurt yourself" type

22:27.423 --> 22:28.859
if you don't get the form down.

22:28.860 --> 22:30.854
Name's Tony. I'm a personal trainer.

22:31.159 --> 22:33.830
If you ever want to get it
right, I can work you out.

22:35.925 --> 22:37.000
Uh...

22:37.424 --> 22:39.724
Yeah, no, thanks. I'm good on that front.

22:40.118 --> 22:41.431
Well...

22:41.432 --> 22:43.497
In case you change your
mind, here's my card.

22:53.665 --> 22:55.290
Bo: I didn't know your
dad was in the service.

22:55.291 --> 22:56.494
Emily: Me either.

22:56.495 --> 22:57.996
Things got bad after he died,

22:57.997 --> 22:59.410
so I don't like talking about it.

23:00.373 --> 23:01.595
Luke: Hey, Juliette.

23:02.500 --> 23:04.539
Ohhh. What the hell does he want?

23:05.869 --> 23:07.919
Hey. Don't leave yet.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.344
<i>Why? You've made it very clear
that I'm not welcome here.</i>

23:10.345 --> 23:12.859
Yeah, I think, uh, what I made clear

23:12.860 --> 23:15.952
was that, uh, I can be a stubborn cuss.

23:15.953 --> 23:18.398
I'd like for you to perform
for the troops tomorrow.

23:18.399 --> 23:20.412
Ah. You doing this
'cause Rayna's making you?

23:20.413 --> 23:21.528
No. No, no.

23:21.529 --> 23:23.572
I'm, uh, doing it because I may have...

23:24.282 --> 23:25.504
Jumped to some conclusions

23:25.505 --> 23:27.839
about you and about why you're here.

23:27.840 --> 23:30.796
It's just, these folks mean a lot to me.

23:30.797 --> 23:32.022
Yeah, me too.

23:32.023 --> 23:33.413
Yeah, I can see that now.

23:34.009 --> 23:35.611
So, listen, uh, how would you feel

23:35.612 --> 23:37.523
about sticking around and, uh,

23:37.524 --> 23:40.348
maybe us doing something for them together?

23:41.794 --> 23:43.309
- Thanks for the beers.
- Mm.

23:43.310 --> 23:44.526
What's the occasion?

23:44.527 --> 23:45.436
[Sniffs]

23:45.772 --> 23:50.333
Well... Zoey said that you and Juliette

23:50.334 --> 23:53.321
were having a couple
problems, and, uh, I thought,

23:53.322 --> 23:55.783
hey, maybe you could
use a little dude advice.

23:55.784 --> 23:57.964
[Chuckling] You know?
Have some... some bro time.

23:57.965 --> 23:59.975
Well, since you brought it up...

23:59.976 --> 24:01.036
[Inhales deeply]

24:01.738 --> 24:03.127
I don't know... it's like she's been

24:03.128 --> 24:06.295
putting this wall up
between us lately and...

24:06.296 --> 24:08.815
You know, I saw her at the
BMI party the other night.

24:08.816 --> 24:09.842
Mm-hmm.

24:10.853 --> 24:13.165
And she was, uh... well, she was...

24:13.166 --> 24:14.365
- She was...
- She was what?

24:14.366 --> 24:15.668
[knock on door] Zoey: Avery?

24:16.373 --> 24:17.640
- Hold that thought.
- [Chuckling] Yeah.

24:17.641 --> 24:18.769
It's open.

24:19.445 --> 24:20.491
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

24:20.963 --> 24:23.147
I tried to call. Am I interrupting?

24:23.148 --> 24:25.000
Yeah, we just started to talk.

24:25.001 --> 24:26.165
Well, guess what.

24:26.166 --> 24:27.896
You are looking at the newest backup singer

24:27.897 --> 24:30.044
for Juliette Barnes.

24:30.045 --> 24:31.791
Ohh! Small world!

24:31.792 --> 24:32.964
I know, right?

24:32.965 --> 24:34.675
Zoey, that's fantastic. Congratulations.

24:34.676 --> 24:36.164
Thank you. Thank you.

24:36.165 --> 24:37.351
Come here. [Chuckles]

24:40.043 --> 24:43.234
Ohhh, so, anyway, sorry
to break up your guy time,

24:43.235 --> 24:44.775
but I want to celebrate
with my boyfriend...

24:46.415 --> 24:47.691
Right now.

24:49.201 --> 24:50.656
Right. Right.

24:51.051 --> 24:52.760
Girls. [Chuckles, sighs]

24:52.761 --> 24:54.531
Oh. Uh, real quick.

24:54.532 --> 24:58.050
Um, what... what were you
saying before about Juliette?

24:59.082 --> 25:00.889
She looked, um...

25:02.808 --> 25:04.813
She looked lost without you.

25:06.048 --> 25:07.418
Got to go.

25:07.419 --> 25:08.644
Good night.

25:09.012 --> 25:10.345
[Door closes]

25:10.766 --> 25:12.057
We agreed I would tell him.

25:12.690 --> 25:15.182
I mean, now what? You got this gig, so...

25:15.183 --> 25:17.051
Look, I'm sorry. I know I agreed.

25:17.437 --> 25:19.308
It was super-easy in the abstract,

25:19.309 --> 25:22.393
but the reality of it is,
I'm gonna be working with her.

25:22.394 --> 25:23.779
<i>So are you.</i>

25:32.680 --> 25:34.323
You know if Zoey's working tonight?

25:34.324 --> 25:35.461
Nope.

25:35.462 --> 25:37.465
- What about Avery?
- Not that I know of.

25:37.466 --> 25:39.892
Uh, I don't think we've
officially met. I'm Scarlett.

25:40.220 --> 25:41.305
How long you been here?

25:41.306 --> 25:42.792
Just started a week ago. I'm Mark.

25:42.793 --> 25:44.872
Lots of new faces.
Something to get used to.

25:46.973 --> 25:47.937
Excuse me.

25:47.938 --> 25:49.082
Yeah, what can I get you?

25:49.083 --> 25:51.094
I'm sorry. Are you Scarlett O'Connor?

25:51.440 --> 25:53.058
- Yeah, I am.
- See? Told you.

25:53.597 --> 25:54.831
You playing here tonight?

25:54.832 --> 25:56.907
Uh, oh, no. But I can get you some drinks.

25:56.908 --> 25:58.896
- Couple of beers, whatever you have on tap.
- Got it.

25:58.897 --> 26:01.034
Hey, uh, sorry for what happened to you...

26:01.035 --> 26:02.945
that... Thing onstage.

26:02.946 --> 26:04.600
Oh. Thanks.

26:04.601 --> 26:07.011
Um... Can I get you guys something to eat?

26:07.012 --> 26:09.816
So, I guess you're just back
to being a waitress, then?

26:10.117 --> 26:11.279
Yeah.

26:11.280 --> 26:13.472
It's a shame. 'Cause you were really good.

26:13.473 --> 26:15.319
Okay, we'll start with the chicken fingers

26:15.320 --> 26:17.358
and the sweet-potato fries.

26:18.531 --> 26:19.568
You got it.

26:23.309 --> 26:24.692
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:24.693 --> 26:25.742
[Groans]

26:28.564 --> 26:29.619
Long day.

26:29.620 --> 26:30.611
Yeah. Sorry about that.

26:30.612 --> 26:32.244
I got hung up talking to a few folks...

26:32.245 --> 26:33.538
last-minute planning.

26:34.281 --> 26:35.473
[Groans] How you feeling?

26:35.474 --> 26:38.147
Well [Chuckles] I've been worse.

26:40.299 --> 26:41.640
You want some water or anything?

26:41.641 --> 26:44.417
No. No, no. I'm good. [Groans]

26:44.418 --> 26:46.156
Heard you had a little change
of heart about Juliette.

26:46.157 --> 26:49.546
<i>Yeah, well, even I can admit
to being an ass sometimes.</i>

26:49.547 --> 26:50.502
[Chuckles]

26:50.503 --> 26:52.595
Well, I-I-I
think I've decided

26:52.596 --> 26:54.964
I'm gonna do a song with the girls.

26:54.965 --> 26:56.352
- Really?
- I don't know.

26:56.353 --> 26:58.625
After talking to that Colonel...

27:00.577 --> 27:01.898
Does seem like it'd be nice...

27:01.899 --> 27:04.178
all those families there
and all that, you know?

27:04.179 --> 27:06.116
Yeah, I think the folks on
the base would love that.

27:08.548 --> 27:10.208
Hey, so, what's going on?

27:10.963 --> 27:13.419
I feel like there's this
tension between us or something,

27:15.049 --> 27:16.805
and... I don't really know
where it's coming from.

27:16.806 --> 27:18.213
I mean, I feel like you're
picking fights with me

27:18.214 --> 27:22.093
and saying I had an agenda about the show,

27:22.094 --> 27:24.760
and... Seems like you're pushing me away.

27:24.761 --> 27:25.950
I don't know why.

27:27.155 --> 27:28.453
[Sighs]

27:28.454 --> 27:31.107
Well, I'm sorry for being a jerk.

27:31.108 --> 27:32.102
[Chuckles]

27:32.646 --> 27:34.637
But when that I.E.D. went off,

27:36.052 --> 27:41.151
I thought, "this is it.
It's over. I'm dying."

27:41.152 --> 27:43.849
But I didn't see my life
flash before my eyes...

27:43.850 --> 27:45.027
not like they say.

27:45.028 --> 27:46.999
I-I, uh, saw my kids.

27:50.984 --> 27:52.636
And I saw you, Rayna.

27:54.992 --> 27:56.305
I love you.

27:57.590 --> 27:59.462
And, uh, if I'm a little edgy about it,

27:59.463 --> 28:01.364
maybe it's 'cause, uh...

28:03.570 --> 28:06.495
I'm not really sure you
feel the same way about me.

28:08.446 --> 28:10.060
You're not?

28:10.061 --> 28:11.429
[Chuckling] No.

28:12.671 --> 28:14.074
I love you.

28:14.390 --> 28:17.134
- I'm all-in,
babe. - [Laughs]

28:17.135 --> 28:19.668

28:32.512 --> 28:35.210
We are so thrilled and honored

28:35.211 --> 28:38.283

28:38.284 --> 28:41.431
And Luke and I are just
huge, huge fans of yours.

28:41.432 --> 28:42.402

28:45.040 --> 28:46.987

queen of country, this one.

28:46.988 --> 28:48.652
This isn't about us today, and, you know,

28:48.653 --> 28:50.245
we don't have queens in this country,

28:50.246 --> 28:53.239
<i>but we do have an amazing first lady.</i>

28:53.240 --> 28:54.243

29:18.151 --> 29:20.377

29:20.378 --> 29:21.999
<i>that when your active duty ends...</i>

29:22.000 --> 29:23.447
Is this how it's gonna be from now on?

29:23.448 --> 29:26.578
Me and you and Maddie and him... her dad?

29:26.579 --> 29:27.910
No. No.

29:27.911 --> 29:30.311
Listen, I-I know it's confusing,

29:30.312 --> 29:33.245
but regardless of how
things look right now,

29:33.847 --> 29:36.680
you two will always be
the Conrad sisters, okay?

29:36.681 --> 29:37.844
<i>Now, I could go on forever about</i>

29:37.845 --> 29:40.416
<i>the extraordinary contributions
of our men and women in uniform</i>

29:40.772 --> 29:42.731
<i>and how it's our solemn obligation</i>

29:42.732 --> 29:45.433
<i>to serve them as well as they've served us,</i>

29:46.103 --> 29:48.659
<i>but Rayna and Luke
promised you all some music,</i>

29:48.962 --> 29:50.776
<i>so I'll let them get to it.</i>

29:50.777 --> 29:54.249
<i>Thank you again for your
service, and God bless.</i>

29:54.250 --> 29:56.292
[Cheers and applause]

29:56.293 --> 29:58.426
I think the show's really
gonna do things for us.

29:59.207 --> 30:00.456
Hey.

30:00.457 --> 30:01.792
Hey, what's wrong?

30:16.017 --> 30:18.207
Yeah, well, they still bug me.

30:18.208 --> 30:19.573
Just act like they're not there.

30:19.574 --> 30:22.760
How? They're
every-damn-where I look!

and being here at Fort Campbell.

30:38.538 --> 30:42.444

Now, listen, before things went
sideways for me in Afghanistan,

30:52.708 --> 30:54.549
I had a chance to see firsthand...

30:54.550 --> 30:56.625
Turns out he's a pretty good dude.

30:57.303 --> 30:58.454
Yeah, he is.

30:59.012 --> 31:00.334
Well, hold on to him,

31:00.335 --> 31:03.079
because they are few and far between.

31:03.080 --> 31:05.162
[Chuckles] True.

Someone who knows firsthand

31:06.583 --> 31:08.970
