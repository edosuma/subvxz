05:19.053 --> 05:22.694
One day, not so long ago...

05:24.525 --> 05:28.229
your mother was sitting in the window...

05:28.329 --> 05:31.572
looking out on the snow
that covered the land.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.368
- She was sewing a cap.
- A winter cap?

05:34.468 --> 05:36.675
A winter cap, yes.

05:37.204 --> 05:41.243
And wishing for a child
to grow inside her belly.

05:42.009 --> 05:45.646
Suddenly, she pricked her finger
with the needle...

05:45.746 --> 05:48.317
and her blood fell into the snow.

05:48.582 --> 05:53.554
And she looked and thought to herself,
"I would like a baby boy."

05:53.988 --> 05:55.990
A little girl, Nannau.

05:56.090 --> 05:59.401

06:38.766 --> 06:41.001
What kind of mischief
have you been up to today?

06:41.101 --> 06:44.446
I picked roses and irises from the garden
with Greta and Ilsa.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.314
And I helped in the kitchen.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.611
Did you read the scripture?

06:50.711 --> 06:52.554
- Yes.
- Good.

when we die?

God gives us wings so we can...

07:02.289 --> 07:05.736
fly out from paradise
and look down upon the world.

07:07.094 --> 07:10.007
- Does Mama look down on me?
- Yes...

07:10.931 --> 07:14.003
and she smiles
when she hears your prayers.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.672
Do you still love Mama?

07:19.840 --> 07:21.114
Always.

07:24.311 --> 07:26.313
Then why is she coming?

07:36.590 --> 07:38.536
Come here, little bird.

What?

07:43.797 --> 07:45.367
What if she doesn't like me?

07:46.834 --> 07:48.541
She will adore you.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.539
Just as I do.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.378

- Thank you, Frederick.

09:16.523 --> 09:18.867
Lilliana, where have you been?

09:20.627 --> 09:22.368
Look what I found.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.408
It'll be a butterfly someday.

09:27.801 --> 09:30.907
Lilli, I want you to meet Lady Claudia.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.708
Can I put her in a box?

09:36.443 --> 09:38.445
- Who?
- The caterpillar.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.461
Let me see.

09:48.889 --> 09:51.631
What will you do with her
when she grows wings?

09:52.159 --> 09:53.832
I'll let her go.

09:55.496 --> 09:59.308
I have a box
with a special surprise inside.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.435

Treat him well
and he will always be faithful.

- Look, Nannau.
- Come along now, child.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.546
It's beautiful.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.351
Now it is yours as well.

10:53.353 --> 10:56.129
This is my brother, Gustav.

10:59.293 --> 11:01.895
God did not bless him
with a graceful tongue...

11:01.995 --> 11:05.204
but he more than compensates
with the wit of his hands.

11:17.911 --> 11:21.654
Now, I will leave you to unpack.

11:51.778 --> 11:54.520
- What a lovely view.
- Yes, milady.

11:55.582 --> 11:58.028
It was Lady Hoffman's favorite.

11:58.619 --> 11:59.893
Was it?

12:02.789 --> 12:06.362
Please be careful. It was my mother's.

if she could see me now?

12:40.394 --> 12:41.566
Here.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.745
Would she be happy for me?

12:50.237 --> 12:51.841
Would she smile?

12:53.306 --> 12:55.286
Or would she be angry...

12:56.910 --> 13:00.016
knowing that the world,
which so despised her...

13:01.281 --> 13:02.988
has embraced me?

13:07.788 --> 13:10.359
I do love him, Gustav.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.854
And he will love me.

that you have everything you need.

But I am not well provided for at all.

Ilsa, beyond the fields and walls?

20:06.906 --> 20:09.546
The beasts of the forest, I imagine.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.645
There must be more to the world
than the forest.

20:12.745 --> 20:15.726
Why would you want to leave
your good home?

20:16.416 --> 20:20.922
Because it's not the same home anymore.
It hasn't been for a long time.

32:31.851 --> 32:34.832
I must have blamed you for so many things.

32:38.057 --> 32:40.401
But I never meant to hurt you.

32:42.995 --> 32:44.497
Can you forgive me?

32:53.339 --> 32:55.512
You're such a lovely girl, Lilliana.

32:58.010 --> 33:00.422
I don't think I ever realized...

33:00.913 --> 33:02.324
how lovely...

33:03.349 --> 33:04.726
until now.

33:11.891 --> 33:15.127
I have very much enjoyed our time together
these past few weeks.

33:15.227 --> 33:16.604
So have I.

33:17.429 --> 33:19.340
- Have you really?
- Yes.

33:21.333 --> 33:24.337
I must be leaving for Paris in a few days.

I know.

33:28.841 --> 33:30.377
Before I go...

33:31.877 --> 33:35.450
I intend to ask your father for your hand
in marriage.

33:38.550 --> 33:40.291
That is, if you approve.

33:40.719 --> 33:42.926
Yes, Peter, I approve.

33:52.965 --> 33:54.433
Beg pardon, Dr. Gutenberg...

33:54.533 --> 33:57.412
but Lady Hoffman requests your presence.
At once.

34:02.441 --> 34:04.546
Will you ride in with me?

I'll meet you at the stables.

Did she cry out?

37:33.252 --> 37:34.856
Did she beg for her life?

37:37.256 --> 37:39.258
Did she know it was me?

37:41.994 --> 37:43.268
Brother.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.701
You mustn't feel remorse.

37:47.299 --> 37:51.304
The blood you spilled
was just the venom of a scheming child.

38:10.355 --> 38:13.495
Why don't you take what's left
to the kitchen?

38:15.060 --> 38:17.472
Put it in the stew by the fire.

38:24.836 --> 38:26.805
What the devil is keeping them?

38:26.905 --> 38:29.249
You worry too much, Frederick.

I am sure she will be arriving any moment.

My dear husband.

42:54.306 --> 42:56.013
Are you in pain?

42:57.142 --> 43:00.248
I've been praying since you left
that you would find her.

43:00.512 --> 43:04.619
We have to keep looking. We have to.

43:05.684 --> 43:08.824
Of course. We will, my beloved.

43:13.925 --> 43:15.427
Are you here alone?

43:16.862 --> 43:18.705
She could be lying.

43:19.865 --> 43:21.367
Who are you?

43:23.802 --> 43:28.114
- Why are you here?
- What's your name, child?

43:28.373 --> 43:30.478
She is no child.

43:30.609 --> 43:32.555
Maybe she can't speak.

43:33.845 --> 43:35.119
Can't speak.

43:36.147 --> 43:39.151
Then she won't make a fuss
when the wolves eat her.

43:39.317 --> 43:40.990
I say we throw her out.

43:44.523 --> 43:46.196

They tied him to a stake,
then burned his family while he watched.

Then they placed
a red-hot cross of iron on his face.

01:04:27.464 --> 01:04:31.503
- Because he would not repent.
- What was his crime?

01:04:32.602 --> 01:04:36.516
- He would not fight for their cause.
- Who were they?

01:04:39.009 --> 01:04:41.114
