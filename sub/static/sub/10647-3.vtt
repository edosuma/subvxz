Two spider-men to take down one goblin?
How long could that take?

10:54.337 --> 10:56.616
Hurry! Strange must be losing control!

11:08.003 --> 11:12.106
PETER: Now let's see you try to
stop two spider... (SCREAMING) Men!

11:13.156 --> 11:14.489
(BOTH YELLING)

11:15.573 --> 11:16.900
BARON MORDO: Yes!

11:17.126 --> 11:22.264
- Well done, my goblin.
- I am not your goblin!

11:22.298 --> 11:24.684
I take orders from no one.

11:24.946 --> 11:27.469
A monster after my own heart.

11:27.501 --> 11:34.817
Nonsense! This beast's will cannot
oppose that of its new master, Hydra.

11:36.279 --> 11:37.279
(GASPS)

11:38.618 --> 11:42.891
- I have no master!
- Blasted ignoramus!

11:43.286 --> 11:47.217
You shall be subjugated
to the will of Baron Mordo,

11:47.323 --> 11:49.125
ruler of the mystic!

11:55.586 --> 11:58.590
MILES: Should we, uh, let these guys
sort this out amongst themselves?

11:58.615 --> 12:02.537
I wish. The siege perilous could destroy
the world in any of their hands.

12:02.572 --> 12:05.486
It's the only way to send you and
the goblin back to your world.

12:05.733 --> 12:07.766
DR. STRANGE: (WEARILY)
You were right, Spider-Man.

12:08.177 --> 12:11.660
Miles has balanced
our reality... For now.

12:11.685 --> 12:15.488
Dr. Strange, that was a pretty
hard goblin hit. Trust me, I know.

12:15.513 --> 12:19.361
I will be fine. Once my chakras realign.

12:19.386 --> 12:20.987
Chakras. Right.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.963
What time is that?
Loser o'clock?

12:39.988 --> 12:43.076
You cannot handle that power, imbecile!

12:43.101 --> 12:44.439
Maybe you're right.

12:46.615 --> 12:48.069
You wanna try, Miles?

12:50.520 --> 12:52.494
(GRUNTING)

12:52.661 --> 12:54.738
Yet another spider?

12:55.224 --> 12:59.790
Wow! Your world's Doc Ock is way old.
What are you, 30?

13:17.880 --> 13:19.581
BOTH: I'm gonna guess that's not good.

13:19.615 --> 13:24.056
Blunt force from the siege perilous
is puncturing holes in our reality.

13:24.081 --> 13:24.981
Yep.

13:25.754 --> 13:28.187
Not good at all.

13:28.613 --> 13:30.854
Bashing reality itself?

13:33.040 --> 13:37.244
I've always wanted to destroy
an entire universe.

Good, 'cause if you did,

I get to destroy his entire world!

14:30.378 --> 14:33.872
But it's my world as well, you imbecile.

14:35.391 --> 14:36.264
Aah!

14:36.289 --> 14:38.720
Goblin, you are smarter than this.

14:38.803 --> 14:42.303
I wanted a weapon, not
a destroyer of worlds.

15:11.154 --> 15:14.345
Uh, he was pretty strong
before he became invincible.

15:14.370 --> 15:16.840
The goblin cannot be harmed
while holding it,

15:16.865 --> 15:20.792
but the siege perilous can be
destroyed with an energy surge.

15:21.162 --> 15:23.404
Then let me introduce it
to my arachno-blast.

15:23.439 --> 15:25.802
No. If we destroy it,
you'll be trapped here.

15:25.827 --> 15:27.718
We'll beat him the way we did before.

18:14.378 --> 18:16.546
Hurry. He could have enough residual

18:16.571 --> 18:19.268
dimensional energy

Of course not, you neanderthal.

19:23.283 --> 19:25.268
Unlike the mindless Hydra,

19:25.293 --> 19:28.730
I am intelligent enough to know
when to retreat.

19:28.755 --> 19:33.468
But make no mistake,
today's loss is on you.

19:33.493 --> 19:37.976
You wanted to control me.
I cannot be controlled.

Don't worry about it. Come on.

We're actually both Spider-Man.

20:53.571 --> 20:55.545
You can't both be Spider-Man.

20:55.687 --> 20:58.522
Okay, let's be fair and square.
I'll be Spider-Man.

20:58.557 --> 21:00.358

What are you, 13?

21:02.261 --> 21:04.932
- Maybe.
- What are you, 150?

21:04.957 --> 21:08.156
Look, his name's Miles, and he's the
Spider-Man from another dimension,

21:08.347 --> 21:10.784
- and he's kind of trapped here.
- Temporarily.

21:11.203 --> 21:12.067

21:12.092 --> 21:15.398
Well, then, welcome
to the team, Spider-Man.

21:16.037 --> 21:18.172
Wait. What? No. I'm Spider-Man.

21:18.197 --> 21:20.066
I've been Spider-Man for, like, ever.

21:20.681 --> 21:23.006
He called it, dude, fair and square.

21:23.031 --> 21:23.987
It's indisputable.

21:24.979 --> 21:26.550
No, it's very disputable.

21:26.585 --> 21:28.956
This place might not be
so bad after all.

21:28.981 --> 21:29.964
Glad you like it.
