WEBVTT

00:01.084 --> 00:02.620
[Aaron] Previously
on Designated Survivor...

00:02.753 --> 00:04.083
Can you run a plate?

00:04.213 --> 00:06.204
[Aaron] The car comes back
to the Russian Embassy.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.125
But Damian's MI6.

00:08.258 --> 00:11.125
-Yes, and he may have turned.
-You lied to me about everything.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.640
[gasping]

00:18.769 --> 00:19.474
We need to talk.

00:19.603 --> 00:22.391
You joined British intelligence
but you were working with the Russians.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.764
We have a case against you for espionage.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.436
| suggest you start answering our questions.

00:26.568 --> 00:29.310
Hacking's one thing
I've been working on solving for Russia.

00:29.446 --> 00:30.982
Someone is hunting big game.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.900
And Russia and the US are both targets.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.899
-So what now?
-You're going to be charged.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.993
-And the help I gave you?
-Will be taken under consideration.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.498
Who do you blame for Alex's death?

00:39.623 --> 00:40.909
Evan Beeman killed my wife.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.829
That's who's responsible.
Who do you blame?

00:43.961 --> 00:46.828
You need to find a concrete way
to acknowledge your grief.

00:46.964 --> 00:50.082
Mr. Beeman, would you say
your treatment here has been fair?

00:50.217 --> 00:51.082
Yes, sir.

00:51.218 --> 00:53.175
[Tom] Good. Because I want you to remember,

00:53.303 --> 00:56.170
every single day for the rest of your life,
what you took from me.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.843
-That went viral 20 minutes ago.
-How the hell did this get out?

00:58.976 --> 01:01.013
[Lyor] Clearly, someone hacked
into the prison system.

01:01.144 --> 01:01.975
[Seth] But how?

01:03.146 --> 01:05.683
[anchor] Tom Kirkman, American Caesar,

01:05.816 --> 01:08.604
hauling a convicted felon in front of him
SO he can dress him down.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.988
It's the video
the country can't stop talking about.

01:11.113 --> 01:12.603
And the White House can't start.

01:12.739 --> 01:15.197
Executive overreach caught on camera.

01:15.325 --> 01:18.158
The issue is as black and white
as the video sweeping the nation.

01:18.287 --> 01:21.405
That's right, and there's no gray area.
The president was wrong.

01:23.125 --> 01:27.369
Sir, the problem isn't just the video.
It's that we're not spinning it.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.120
[Seth] So the media's doing it for us.

01:29.256 --> 01:32.214
They're calling you imperial,
angry, distraught.

01:32.342 --> 01:34.595
[sternly] Yeah, I am angry and I am distraught.

01:38.974 --> 01:40.464
What do you suggest?

01:40.601 --> 01:43.559
That we issue a statement,
an expression of remorse.

01:43.687 --> 01:46.520
You were in the throes of grief.
The visit was ill-advised.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.559
It was an inadvertent executive overreach.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.478
But you respect the justice system.

01:50.611 --> 01:54.650
Acknowledge that Evan Beeman is entitled
to serve his sentence without interference.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.738
-I'm not saying any of that.
-Sir--

01:56.867 --> 01:59.154
| never said that Evan Beeman was a monster.

01:59.786 --> 02:03.780
But through his negligence,
his carelessness, he killed my wife.

02:04.708 --> 02:07.245
I'm not gonna apologize
for taking him to task for that.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.630
And it doesn't make me a dictator.

02:11.340 --> 02:12.421
It makes me human.

02:12.549 --> 02:17.214
Yes, sir. A human being whose unfavorables
are up and approval ratings are way down.

02:17.346 --> 02:19.587
They're polls, Lyor. They'll bounce back.

02:19.723 --> 02:21.259
The pertinent question is,
who leaked the video?

02:21.391 --> 02:23.507
Agent Wells is overseeing
the investigation.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.932
She's debriefing the prison's IT experts,
looking into their security.

02:27.064 --> 02:29.101
We'll let you know
as soon as she's done working it.

02:29.232 --> 02:30.893
"Work." There's an idea.

02:31.026 --> 02:33.393
You have a sit-down
with the Fed chairman later this morning.

02:33.528 --> 02:35.690
And the board
of Alex's charitable foundation

02:35.822 --> 02:37.404
has its inaugural meeting
in the Roosevelt Room,

02:37.532 --> 02:40.820
-among plenty other items on your agenda.
-How many other items?

02:46.333 --> 02:47.539
Let's get cracking.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.874
So the president actually works in the building
during the tours?

02:56.009 --> 02:59.218
Yes, ma'am. This is not a museum.
This is the People's House.

02:59.346 --> 03:03.465
That's lovely. And this area connects
the East and West Wings?

03:03.600 --> 03:05.102
Correct, this is the juncture.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.265
Excuse me, what are you doing?
Get up right now.

03:12.401 --> 03:15.439
[indistinct chatter]

03:16.071 --> 03:19.314
-This is Simmons. We have a problem.
-[man over radio] Copy that.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.941
[Seth] The president needs to address
the prison thing.

03:22.077 --> 03:23.988
-He does.
-You're supposed to wrangle him.

03:24.121 --> 03:25.486
-I am.
-But you're not.

03:25.622 --> 03:28.990
I'm loving this declarative sentence thing
you're doing. Uh, my turn.

03:29.126 --> 03:32.960
Tom Kirkman is my boss.
My job is to advise, not compel.

03:33.088 --> 03:35.125
And would you please disintegrate?

03:35.257 --> 03:38.170
That last one was an interrogatory,
not a declaration.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.837
-I'm branching out.
-[Mike] Hey.

03:39.970 --> 03:41.756
We've got a problem with one of the tours.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.095
Mike, just tell them they can't sit
at the Resolute Desk.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.841
Good, 'cause 30 people are happy
parking it in the hallway.

03:46.977 --> 03:49.309
It's a sit-in. They say they're with some tribe.

03:49.438 --> 03:52.430
-You say "tribe"?
-Yeah. Protesters are being removed.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.183
Removed? Is the White House press corps
in the building?

03:55.318 --> 03:59.186
-Yeah, I have my briefing in an hour.
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

03:59.322 --> 04:02.360
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Lyor chuckles nervously]

04:02.492 --> 04:05.280
What's going on?
These people are our guests.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.449
Stop. Stop. Stop!

04:07.581 --> 04:09.697
Uncuff him, please. Uncuff him.

04:09.833 --> 04:10.868
-Thank you. Uncuff him.
-Now.

04:11.001 --> 04:13.834
Good. As you were, sir.
As you were, please.

04:13.962 --> 04:17.500
There's nothing to see here.
It's just civic engagement,

04:17.632 --> 04:21.375
which the White House heartily endorses.
You can quote me on that.

04:21.511 --> 04:24.469
[chuckles] All right. You guys all good?

04:24.598 --> 04:26.464
Anybody want a coffee
or a donut or anything?

04:27.142 --> 04:30.351
They're the Ocheole tribe,
from just outside Pensacola.

04:30.479 --> 04:33.722
Their leader, Lacey Cousins,
wants an audience with the president.

04:33.857 --> 04:35.723
-To discuss what?
-She wouldn't say.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.567
Is this a joke? You don't get to sit down
at the White House

04:38.695 --> 04:40.732
and demand a meeting
with the leader of the free world.

04:40.864 --> 04:43.822
You do if CNN's already picked up the story.
God, I hate a free press.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.817
-Yeah, the feeling's mutual.
-Okay, um, I'll sit down with Ms. Cousins.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.911
Okay. That way at least I can say
she had an audience with senior staff.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.075
No. Not good enough.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.199
I'm sorry, have you, uh...
Have you seen Lyor?

04:53.335 --> 04:55.702
He's 5'10". Blue eyes.
Definitely dropped on his head.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.248
It's optics, Seth.

04:57.380 --> 05:01.044
Right now, this prison video depicts the
president as heartless and heavy-handed.

05:01.176 --> 05:04.669
What better counterpoint than a meeting
with an historically oppressed minority?

05:04.805 --> 05:06.762
One that makes him look calm,
humane, thoughtful.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.096
Presidential.

05:08.225 --> 05:12.435
Or we can just let everybody run the video
of the Ocheole getting arrested. On a loop!

05:12.562 --> 05:16.055
This'll be a nice companion piece
to the president berating a prisoner.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.069
Good morning.

05:22.197 --> 05:24.734
Gary, good to see you.
Thank you so much for coming.

05:24.866 --> 05:26.527
It's good to see you too, Mr. President.

05:27.202 --> 05:29.944
Having you as a trustee
for Alex's foundation

05:30.080 --> 05:32.572
would've meant the world to her.
Thank you so much.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.999
Tom, it's good to see you.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.962
| was told you were gonna be delayed.

05:40.757 --> 05:43.545
Shuffled a few work things.
Caught an early flight from the city.

05:43.677 --> 05:44.758
How are the kids?

05:45.595 --> 05:46.926
They're doing the best they can.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.634
Sorry we didn't get to talk
at Alex's funeral,

05:49.766 --> 05:51.882
but I'm honored to be a trustee
of her foundation.

05:52.018 --> 05:52.803
Right.

05:53.436 --> 05:57.771
Kendra, this is my brother, Trey.
Kendra's the White House's counsel.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.231
-Of course. It's a pleasure.
-Same.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.725
If you could give us a moment...

06:02.946 --> 06:05.938
Ah, attorney-client privilege.
| know all about it.

06:07.242 --> 06:09.950
| give you my proxy.
Let me know when this is wrapped up.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.443
Yes, sir.

06:14.916 --> 06:17.829
-How many people are in the sit-in?
-Approximately 30.

06:17.961 --> 06:20.419
-And her name is Cousins?
-Ms. Cousins.

06:20.547 --> 06:21.537
Thank you.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.586
-Ms. Cousins.
-Mr. President.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.552
You should know that I'm not in the habit
of giving audiences to people

06:28.680 --> 06:31.798
who engage in obstructive behavior,
especially here in this building.

06:31.933 --> 06:32.718
Yes, sir.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.927
But I am more than aware that this nation,
at times,

06:36.062 --> 06:39.600
has treated its indigenous peoples
very, very harshly.

06:40.358 --> 06:43.817
So I would like to hear
what you have to say. Please, sit.

06:43.945 --> 06:45.731
Thank you, sir. I'll be brief.

06:47.032 --> 06:50.616
Eighteen years ago,
the Ocheole were the victims of eminent domain

06:50.744 --> 06:52.530
to make way for a commercial development.

06:52.662 --> 06:55.529
We were removed from our homes
and forced onto a small plot of land.

06:55.665 --> 06:58.999
-I'm very sorry to hear that.
-Now we're being evicted again.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.118
Phase two, the developer calls it.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.756
We're a small tribe.

07:02.881 --> 07:07.091
And each relocation severs our connection
to our land and each other.

07:07.218 --> 07:09.801
Ma'am, eminent domain is a local matter.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.841
[Tom] I'm afraid Emily's right.

07:11.973 --> 07:15.056
Regardless of how moved I may be
by your complaint,

07:15.185 --> 07:17.051
this is not a matter
for the federal government.

07:17.187 --> 07:20.521
No, sir. But it involves you.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.064
[chuckles softly] I'm sorry.
| don't follow.

07:23.193 --> 07:27.278
The development was
the Wannachobee project outside Pensacola.

07:28.239 --> 07:30.276
The developer went out of state
to hire someone

07:30.408 --> 07:33.446
who specialized
in complicated land use issues.

07:33.578 --> 07:34.818
Wannachobee.

07:34.955 --> 07:38.289
Yes. They tapped a young architect
who fiercely advocated

07:38.416 --> 07:41.033
for the conversion of our land
for commercial use.

07:45.090 --> 07:48.082
-You're saying I did this to you?
-Yes, sir.

07:48.885 --> 07:53.425
And if you don't help us now,
our tribe is going to vanish forever.

07:57.185 --> 07:59.142
[theme music playing]

08:08.321 --> 08:09.277
[knock at door]

08:10.615 --> 08:12.026
Mr. President.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.273
Billy!

08:14.786 --> 08:15.901
Great to see you.

08:16.871 --> 08:19.784
-Thank you very much for coming.
-Of course, Mr. President.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.782
This is my Chief of Staff, Emily Rhodes.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.831
Billy was my first hire
at my architecture firm.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.876
He ran point on the Wannachobee project.
Please.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.796
-Heard a lot about you, Mr. Winton.
-Billy.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.134
- I could tell you stories about your boss.
-[chuckles]

08:33.263 --> 08:36.847
Eighteen-hour days.
Chewing coffee beans to stay awake.

08:36.975 --> 08:39.933
That's because we couldn't figure out
how to work the coffee machine.

08:40.061 --> 08:43.725
Billy was 23 when I hired him.
Looked like he was 12.

08:43.857 --> 08:44.972
You've come a long way.

08:45.108 --> 08:45.893
| learned from the best.

08:46.026 --> 08:49.189
Well, I clearly wasn't at my best
when I drew this up.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.731
What have you found out?

08:50.864 --> 08:52.650
I've been through all the old papers.

08:52.782 --> 08:55.649
The Ocheole weren't
a federally recognized tribe.

08:55.785 --> 08:58.197
Of the 1,400 families that we relocated,

08:58.329 --> 09:00.787
barely a few hundred
identified as Ocheole.

09:00.915 --> 09:03.748
They weren't raising much of a stink
at the time of the eminent domain.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.585
[sighs] I don't remember any opposition.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.795
If I'd known about this,
| would not have done it.

09:08.923 --> 09:12.291
Of course not. There wasn't much
organized opposition to your plan.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.918
That's probably 'cause we managed
to convince the county

09:15.055 --> 09:17.638
to compensate people for their homes
above market value.

09:17.766 --> 09:19.677
Wannachobee's thriving.

09:19.809 --> 09:24.269
It's become one of the most profitable
mixed-use developments in the country.

09:24.397 --> 09:27.435
It's environmentally sound,
aesthetically pleasing.

09:28.485 --> 09:31.022
What about the housing
that the residents were relocated to?

09:31.154 --> 09:33.987
Unfortunately, that neighborhood
hasn't fared quite as well.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.322
Lower middle-class. High unemployment.

09:36.451 --> 09:39.113
Is our old client, Alton Prast,
still involved?

09:39.245 --> 09:43.204
Oh, yeah. Alton will outlive Methuselah.
He's building phase two.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.449
He always struck me as a reasonable man.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.543
What if we got him and Lacey Cousins together,
hammered out a deal?

09:48.671 --> 09:51.003
-I'll set it up.
-[Tom] Thank you.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.004
| hear Trey's in the building.

09:56.137 --> 09:56.922
Yeah.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.513
Think I could talk him into
beer and wings?

09:59.641 --> 10:00.551
It's been a long time.

10:00.683 --> 10:03.596
If you're willing to foot the bill,
you could talk him into anything.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.969
That's what the corporate card is for.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.643
[Chuck] I've had a team
working on the prison hack 24/7.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.482
We scanned the prison mainframe's OS.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.192
Confirmed that their system
had been hacked.

10:12.320 --> 10:16.063
Let me guess. The same signature
as our NASA and Roscosmos hacks.

10:16.199 --> 10:19.157
[Chuck] Yes. An embedded code. 06231912.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.662
-Which means what?
-[Chuck] No clue.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.152
Could be, uh, a cipher,

10:22.288 --> 10:25.371
a randomly generated number,
a polynomial artifact.

10:25.500 --> 10:28.868
But the headline question is: why would someone
target both rockets and prisons?

10:29.003 --> 10:29.959
What's the connection?

10:30.088 --> 10:33.706
Is it a state actor? A consortium?
Who or what is behind this?

10:34.676 --> 10:37.964
- I already told you, I don't know.
-And why don't I believe you?

10:38.555 --> 10:40.967
Why am I still wearing an ankle bracelet
when I've been helping?

10:41.099 --> 10:44.637
It's either that or a 30-year term
for espionage. You wanna take your pick?

10:44.769 --> 10:48.387
She's right. Pony up with something
if you wanna stay out of prison.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.276
Valeria Poriskova.

10:54.404 --> 10:55.439
Who's she?

10:55.572 --> 10:59.406
My handler at the Russian Embassy.
She was running my hacking investigation.

10:59.534 --> 11:01.992
I'm sure she still is.
Maybe she'd be willing to pool resources.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.576
When's the last time you contacted her?

11:04.706 --> 11:06.993
Three months ago. Just before you shot me.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.240
[Aaron] But not since?

11:09.127 --> 11:11.084
No. The Russians think I'm dead.
Remember?

11:11.212 --> 11:14.421
Seems that everyone is underestimating
your resilience, Damian.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.750
| know Valeria really well.
I'll brief you.

11:17.886 --> 11:18.842
We have a dossier.

11:18.970 --> 11:21.052
There's stuff about her
that won't be in the dossier--

11:21.181 --> 11:24.264
Thank you, but I'd rather not get fed
before I know what I'm eating.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.433
If we have more questions,
we know where to find you.

11:32.108 --> 11:34.440
You know, I'm liking you more each day.

11:38.573 --> 11:40.439
[indistinct chatter]

11:41.826 --> 11:44.784
Ms. Poriskova? Thank you for meeting me.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.654
What is this about?

11:46.789 --> 11:49.167
My government would like to pool intelligence.

11:49.292 --> 11:52.705
| don't know what you mean.
I'm a cultural attache.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.795
[scoffs] Yeah, and I'm the queen of England.

11:55.924 --> 11:59.758
Look, our governments have been targets
of the same hacker.

11:59.886 --> 12:02.969
We worked together to save the astronauts,
but our common enemy is still out there,

12:03.097 --> 12:06.180
and his targets include the United States
and Russia.

12:06.309 --> 12:09.392
| don't know
about any hacking investigation.

12:10.521 --> 12:13.104
That's not what Damian Rennett says.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.065
And I know you've been running him.

12:15.693 --> 12:19.607
So it is true, then.
The traitor is not dead.

12:20.698 --> 12:23.907
I'm not here to talk about Damian.
I'm here to talk about the hack.

12:24.035 --> 12:25.196
So talk.

12:25.995 --> 12:29.238
| can take investigational liberties
on American soil that you can't.

12:29.374 --> 12:32.287
So, show me what you have
and let's nail this guy.

12:32.877 --> 12:37.212
You want us to continue cooperating?
We are happy to.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.798
Right after you return Damian to us.

12:40.551 --> 12:41.962
I'm sorry. That's not gonna happen.

12:42.095 --> 12:45.588
-Then we have nothing to talk about.
-[sighs]

12:45.723 --> 12:48.306
We return him to you, we need assurance
at the highest level

12:48.434 --> 12:49.890
that Russia won't liquidate him.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.977
That he can still function
as a joint resource.

12:53.648 --> 12:56.106
Would your government give such assurances

12:56.234 --> 12:59.192
if one of your spies sought refuge
at the Kremlin?

12:59.320 --> 13:02.529
Yes, if that spy had knowledge
that would help our countries.

13:03.324 --> 13:07.818
The knowledge that Damian has
belongs to us. As he does.

13:08.413 --> 13:13.032
You are only borrowing him.
But that lease will soon be up.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.659
Anything happens to him, you will regret it.

13:16.838 --> 13:19.671
| imagine you know something about regret.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.044
Excuse me?

13:23.303 --> 13:25.214
He will compromise you.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.883
Just like he compromised me.

13:34.230 --> 13:37.723
Alton, in short,
I'm proposing a land swap.

13:37.859 --> 13:41.397
A parcel of federal land that's very close
to the current developments.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.440
But not contiguous
and not near the highway.

13:43.573 --> 13:47.692
| realize it's a big ask.
But if my people are uprooted,

13:47.827 --> 13:50.364
we lose our ancestral land
and our heritage.

13:50.496 --> 13:53.238
And I'm sorry for your plight,
but the answer is no.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.876
Alton, please.

13:56.127 --> 13:58.494
The time for this fight was 18 years ago.

13:58.629 --> 14:01.337
My late father, Jacob,
was the tribal chairman then.

14:01.466 --> 14:04.675
He was old. Opposition was beyond him.
But it's not beyond me.

14:04.802 --> 14:05.883
The law is.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.554
Mr. President, you were a great architect.

14:09.682 --> 14:13.016
This development of yours
has created thousands of jobs.

14:13.144 --> 14:14.726
It's added millions to the economy.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.391
It's something that we should both
be proud of it.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.935
And I have no intention of undoing it.

14:24.072 --> 14:27.155
Ms. Cousins,
| know this isn't what you want.

14:27.283 --> 14:30.742
But if you would be willing
to take the land swap instead,

14:30.870 --> 14:33.202
the government would make it
well worth your while.

14:33.331 --> 14:38.167
Sir, my people trace our roots back
800 years to the Florida Peninsula.

14:38.294 --> 14:41.753
We were 90,000-strong at our peak.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.498
-You know how many Ocheole are left?
-No, ma'am.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.124
Fourteen hundred.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.962
And every time we move,
more of our people scatter.

14:50.848 --> 14:53.556
Our current situation is not ideal.

14:53.684 --> 14:55.266
Whatever it looks like now,

14:55.395 --> 14:59.263
for generations, we've planted
on this land and fished on it.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.640
Our ancestors are buried on it.

15:02.735 --> 15:07.024
And if we leave,
we're signing our people's death warrant.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.317
Excuse me.

15:12.036 --> 15:15.870
I'm very sorry, Mr. President,
but what's done can't be undone.

15:15.998 --> 15:18.911
Alton, if I believed that were true,
| wouldn't never have taken this job.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.158
Excuse me, gentlemen.

15:26.300 --> 15:27.210
[Emily sighs]

15:27.343 --> 15:30.176
Know the longest sit-in
at a federal building?

15:30.304 --> 15:31.260
Twenty-five days.

15:31.389 --> 15:32.424
They can't stay here.

15:32.557 --> 15:35.891
The dirt on those floors. Ugh.
The saddle sores.

15:36.018 --> 15:38.851
I've rerouted traffic
and canceled the rest of today's tours.

15:38.980 --> 15:41.438
That kid on the computer,
he's a real trooper.

15:41.566 --> 15:45.104
He's protesting and working.
He's a good multitasker.

15:45.236 --> 15:47.102
-This can't continue.
-[sighs]

15:47.238 --> 15:49.275
You're right. But here's the thing.

15:49.407 --> 15:52.570
Film crews are waiting for these people
to be carried out and cuffed,

15:52.702 --> 15:53.783
and that's not gonna happen.

15:53.911 --> 15:56.448
So either we negotiate
our way out of this,

15:56.581 --> 16:00.540
or the Ocheole may have just found
new tribal land. [chuckles]

16:04.755 --> 16:08.749
The First Lady's proposal was to apportion
the foundation's assets equally

16:08.885 --> 16:12.344
to refugee assistance groups,
homeless shelters for young girls

16:12.472 --> 16:14.509
and heart disease research. Any objection?

16:14.640 --> 16:18.224
Yes. Uh, I'm not convinced
this is an ideal allocation.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.059
I'd like to continue discussion.

16:20.188 --> 16:23.931
All due respect, Trey,
we've been debating this for two hours.

16:24.066 --> 16:27.104
| thought the idea
was to rubber-stamp Alex's wishes.

16:27.236 --> 16:30.149
| think the idea was
for the trustees to weigh in

16:30.281 --> 16:31.487
or we wouldn't be asked to vote.

16:31.616 --> 16:32.777
[Gary] Come on, Trey--

16:32.909 --> 16:35.617
Kendra, am I being out of line?

16:35.745 --> 16:38.237
'Cause if not, I think we still have
some stuff to flesh out.

16:38.372 --> 16:39.828
[smacks lips]

16:41.167 --> 16:45.081
Trey is right.
The charter requires a unanimous vote.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.245
Let's keep talking.

16:49.926 --> 16:51.257
[Emily] Hey, how goes it?

16:51.385 --> 16:53.513
Slow. The president's brother
is pretty deliberate.

16:53.638 --> 16:54.719
What's his story?

16:54.847 --> 16:57.259
Kirkman's only sibling.
Successful trader out of New York.

16:57.391 --> 16:59.257
I've never heard the president
mention his name.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.475
They're in and out of each other's lives.
Mostly out.

17:01.604 --> 17:03.720
There's history there.
The president doesn't talk about it.

17:03.856 --> 17:04.971
Alex must have liked him.

17:05.107 --> 17:07.064
All trustees are important figures
in her life.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.400
-You need to see something now.
-What?

17:11.531 --> 17:14.239
[Lacey] I'm so grateful
to my brothers and sisters

17:14.367 --> 17:16.654
from tribal nations all over the country.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.742
More joining every hour.

17:18.871 --> 17:22.865
Here to support the Ocheole people
in our struggle to save our sacred land.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.115
[reporter] Did you meet
with the president?

17:24.252 --> 17:25.083
[Lacey] Yes.

17:25.211 --> 17:29.500
He offered us a land swap
and here's what I told him:

17:29.632 --> 17:31.748
No to selling out our heritage.

17:31.884 --> 17:36.629
No to an architect who was paid
to put us in this situation. No.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.297
[protestors chanting] Save our land!

17:39.433 --> 17:41.140
-Seth...
-I'm on it.

17:41.269 --> 17:45.012
-[chanting continues]
-[mutes TV]

17:45.147 --> 17:48.105
We've got dozens of Ocheole
staging a protest in the White House.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.271
Other tribes staging a protest outside.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.270
And no way to remove them
without handcuffs and a paddy wagon.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.238
You know what we need
to tell the president?

17:55.366 --> 17:58.529
| do. "You broke it, you fix it."

17:58.661 --> 17:59.947
Yeah.

18:01.289 --> 18:02.450
Damn it.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.749
-[reporters clamoring]
-The president was not aware

18:06.877 --> 18:09.039
he was displacing the Ocheole
at the time he was hired.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.663
-Is he attempting to resolve the situation?
-[Seth] Yes.

18:11.799 --> 18:14.666
He's met with the head
of the Ocheole nation and the developer.

18:14.802 --> 18:17.510
He's consulting with
the Alachua County Land Use Commission.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.925
-[clamoring]
-What would the president like to say

18:20.057 --> 18:23.391
to the 60 tribes
protesting outside the White House?

18:23.519 --> 18:25.226
That he respects the Ocheole's plight

18:25.354 --> 18:28.267
and, um, he's working hard
to craft a solution.

18:28.399 --> 18:32.893
Commissioner, I know the protestors
on Pennsylvania Avenue aren't permitted.

18:33.029 --> 18:36.272
But I would appreciate it
if not a single one was removed.

18:36.407 --> 18:38.819
Thank you for your understanding. Goodbye.

18:38.951 --> 18:42.364
| spoke to the Bureau of Indian Affairs
about recognizing the Ocheole as a nation.

18:42.496 --> 18:45.363
Good. Then we could put the land
in a trust, stop any further development.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.831
The BIA has declined
to recognize the Ocheole in the past.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.497
If we renew the application,
it could take years.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.167
[sighs] Can we cut through the red tape
with a new executive order

18:53.299 --> 18:54.460
giving the Ocheole people
federal recognition?

18:54.592 --> 18:56.879
It's an end run,
but there's no procedural bar.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.428
Start the process.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.718
| also need to update you
on your wife's foundation.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.215
-Is it settled?
-No, sir.

19:04.352 --> 19:07.390
We may have a problem. It's your brother.

19:12.193 --> 19:14.480
Trey, you know the definition of irony?

19:14.612 --> 19:16.478
I'm sure you're gonna enlighten me.

19:16.614 --> 19:19.527
My brother, who I haven't had
a meaningful conversation with

19:19.659 --> 19:23.402
in God knows how long, goes into a meeting
about my wife's legacy

19:23.537 --> 19:25.528
and makes himself the center of attention!

19:25.665 --> 19:26.871
That wasn't my goal.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.990
-Then what was?
-To get your attention.

19:29.126 --> 19:32.369
-You've got it. What do you want?
-To fix things between us.

19:32.505 --> 19:33.961
-Why now?
-Tom...

19:34.090 --> 19:35.421
Seriously, Trey, why now?

19:35.549 --> 19:39.463
| get tenure at Columbia,
you send me an e-mail two months later.

19:39.595 --> 19:40.960
You hadn't returned my last two calls.

19:41.097 --> 19:43.338
Most of my White House staff
didn't even know you existed

19:43.474 --> 19:45.385
because you've never been
to a White House function.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.350
You know I travel for business.

19:47.478 --> 19:50.095
Then you show up at my wife's funeral
and don't talk to me.

19:50.231 --> 19:52.814
"Cause you were surrounded
by Secret Service.

19:52.942 --> 19:55.434
[scoffs] Same old Trey.
Always got an excuse.

19:55.569 --> 19:58.106
| don't need an excuse.
| have an explanation.

19:58.239 --> 20:01.277
Every time I reach out to you,
you don't reach back.

20:01.409 --> 20:03.946
You don't treat me like a brother, Tom.
You treat me like an infection.

20:04.078 --> 20:07.196
"Cause you're a runner.
That's what you do. You run.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.117
That was a long time ago.

20:09.250 --> 20:12.083
Not for me. Our mother was dying.

20:12.962 --> 20:16.000
For three years,
| did everything I could to hold it together.

20:16.132 --> 20:17.418
You know what you were doing?

20:17.550 --> 20:19.962
Backpacking in Bali. Surfing in Maui.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.714
That's not why I left.

20:21.846 --> 20:26.090
[scoffs] I can't wait to hear this one.
Why'd you leave, Trey?

20:26.767 --> 20:29.350
Because I was a screw-up.
The problem child.

20:29.478 --> 20:33.972
And I knew that if I stayed, everyone would be
taking care of me instead of Mom.

20:34.108 --> 20:35.724
Going was my way of helping.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.067
Do you even understand
how selfish you sound?

20:39.697 --> 20:43.440
You leaving hurt Mom more
than your staying ever could have.

20:44.869 --> 20:45.950
I'm sorry.

20:48.038 --> 20:51.531
If you're honestly sorry,
you'll go back in there,

20:51.667 --> 20:55.251
sign off on Alex's wishes and leave.

21:04.889 --> 21:07.347
[typing]

21:10.603 --> 21:12.014
What are you working on?

21:16.025 --> 21:17.515
College application essay.

21:17.651 --> 21:18.607
Where are you applying?

21:19.487 --> 21:22.320
-Wesleyan's my first choice.
-I'm class of 2003.

21:22.448 --> 21:25.986
| do alumni interviews,
go back for reunions. The whole shebang.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.529
What's your essay about?

21:28.579 --> 21:32.072
-It's why I want to be a radiologist.
-No, that's terrible.

21:32.208 --> 21:35.200
One of the application suggestions
was to write about future goals.

21:35.336 --> 21:36.497
It's a trap.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.836
Trust me, if you write about
something boring like that,

21:38.964 --> 21:42.377
they'll use your application as kindling.
Uh, you need to separate yourself from the pack.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.672
You have to write about, uh...

21:44.804 --> 21:47.796
Well, I know exactly
what you can write about.

21:48.808 --> 21:52.551
The time you heroically participated
in a White House sit-in.

21:53.521 --> 21:55.979
-But I'm still participating.
-That's fine.

21:56.106 --> 21:59.315
The application doesn't come
with sodium pentothal.

21:59.443 --> 22:00.353
Here, give it.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.397
I'm supposed to write it myself.

22:02.530 --> 22:05.363
Oh, you will. I'm just gonna give you
a couple of pointers, that's all.

22:05.491 --> 22:06.981
Come on. Come on. Come on.

22:11.288 --> 22:14.701
Alton's offering $20 million to be
distributed to the displaced families,

22:14.834 --> 22:16.996
in addition to what the county's
giving them for eminent domain.

22:17.127 --> 22:18.583
It's a generous proposal.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.544
But money is not the answer here, Billy.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.630
This is their land.
It's what defines them.

22:22.758 --> 22:26.001
Historically, our country has treated
its indigenous people shamefully.

22:26.136 --> 22:28.878
We've taken what we've wanted,
whenever we want.

22:29.014 --> 22:31.096
Now, I've contributed to that shame.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.767
-How?
-Because I missed this.

22:34.895 --> 22:38.433
| was so focused on making
my company successful, I got sloppy.

22:38.566 --> 22:39.977
You couldn't have known about the Ocheole.

22:40.109 --> 22:43.522
| should have,
but I didn't do my due diligence properly.

22:43.654 --> 22:45.565
| can't escape my role in this thing.

22:46.907 --> 22:47.863
There's been a hiccup.

22:47.992 --> 22:50.279
Alton Prast has moved
to enjoin your executive order.

22:50.411 --> 22:51.526
Son of a bitch.

22:52.788 --> 22:56.281
We're gonna have to figure out how to neutralize
this opposition. Whatever it takes.

23:03.465 --> 23:05.718
[Trey] All the 2009 Yankees signed this?

23:05.843 --> 23:09.006
Yep. I was only missing
Mariano's signature.

23:09.138 --> 23:10.378
How'd you wrangle it?

23:10.514 --> 23:12.801
Made my dad invite him to the White House
for dinner.

23:14.351 --> 23:15.432
More effective than my method,

23:15.561 --> 23:18.474
which was ambushing the players
outside Tavern on the Green.

23:18.606 --> 23:19.471
[Leo laughs]

23:19.607 --> 23:21.097
Hey, there's a Capitals game tonight.

23:21.775 --> 23:24.938
Secret Service is a pain,
but we'll have the whole row to ourselves.

23:25.070 --> 23:28.279
Oh, I'd love to go, buddy.
| gotta catch a plane. Get back to work.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.273
But you have an office here.
You can telecommute, right?

23:30.409 --> 23:32.116
No, it's not that simple.

23:32.786 --> 23:34.652
It kind of is.
[chuckles softly]

23:34.788 --> 23:37.120
You're family, but we never see you.

23:37.249 --> 23:40.787
We're not exactly having
big Sunday dinners around here.

23:40.920 --> 23:41.910
| know.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.294
Stick around for once.

23:45.758 --> 23:46.589
Please.

23:47.676 --> 23:49.087
We need you, Uncle Trey.

23:49.762 --> 23:52.629
And I'm here for you.
But your dad and me--

23:52.765 --> 23:55.974
If my mom's death
doesn't bring you two together,

23:56.977 --> 23:57.887
what's going to?

23:58.020 --> 24:01.308
Whatever the issue is,
how can it matter this much?

24:02.983 --> 24:05.270
What matters is that
| love you and your sister.

24:05.402 --> 24:08.110
And I'm just a phone call away.

24:10.074 --> 24:11.940
I'll see you soon.

24:17.748 --> 24:19.955
[Paul] Your prison hack investigation
must've stirred things up.

24:20.084 --> 24:21.415
[Hannah] Paul, is this accurate?

24:21.543 --> 24:23.159
Accurate enough
to bring to your attention.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.582
So there's gonna be an attempt on Damian"s life.

24:25.714 --> 24:26.966
That's what the chatter says.

24:27.091 --> 24:28.252
Who's after him?

24:28.384 --> 24:31.046
Who isn't?
The Russians want him dead.

24:31.178 --> 24:33.886
The British see him as the greatest
traitor since the Cambridge Five.

24:34.014 --> 24:36.847
And our mysterious hacker
wants Damian off his tail.

24:38.686 --> 24:41.394
-So what do you suggest?
-Cut him loose.

24:42.773 --> 24:45.686
-Thanks for the intel.
-Hannah...

24:46.568 --> 24:49.902
This guy's radioactive. Is this thing goes
south, you don't wanna be in the same zip code.

24:55.035 --> 24:58.494
"| believe I can contribute to the success
of the Wesleyan student body,

24:58.622 --> 25:02.035
and that's why I'm sitting down,
writing to you now."

25:03.002 --> 25:05.209
-Okay.
-Is it good?

25:05.921 --> 25:09.915
Yes, it's very good.
If by "good," you mean bad.

25:10.634 --> 25:13.217
Sorry,
| should mix criticism with praise.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.757
Uh, this shows
a firm grasp of the alphabet.

25:16.557 --> 25:18.719
A sit-in's a bad idea
for an application essay.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.388
It's not the subject.
It's how you treat it.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.682
You're writing about civil disobedience here.

25:23.814 --> 25:26.806
You need to infuse the topic
with a sense of jeopardy.

25:26.942 --> 25:27.647
Jeopardy?

25:27.776 --> 25:31.940
There you were, on the barricades,
fighting for your life.

25:32.072 --> 25:34.905
Aware that every moment
could be your last. That kind of thing.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.240
| really don't like this topic.

25:36.368 --> 25:40.453
You need to look at this essay
like your future depends on it.

25:41.999 --> 25:45.833
[sighs] What do you do around here?

25:47.838 --> 25:49.124
| bring the magic.

25:56.722 --> 26:00.681
Yeah? All right. The place is clean.
No bugs. No hidden cameras.

26:01.685 --> 26:03.847
How long do I have to stay here for?

26:03.979 --> 26:07.722
Until we know we can keep you safe.
You need us, you call us.

26:07.858 --> 26:09.144
Oh, on a phone you're monitoring.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.147
That's more freedom than you deserve.

26:16.450 --> 26:17.815
It was real, you know.

26:21.288 --> 26:23.154
| know you think I worked you.

26:23.832 --> 26:25.118
And I did, but...

26:26.627 --> 26:27.867
| cared.

26:30.714 --> 26:33.581
The two things are not mutually exclusive.

26:34.718 --> 26:36.425
No, you played me.

26:37.054 --> 26:39.512
And that's not even the worst part.

26:40.265 --> 26:42.677
The worst part is that you're still doing it.

26:49.483 --> 26:52.145
[all chanting] Save our land!
Save our land!

26:52.277 --> 26:54.814
Save our land! Save our land!

26:54.947 --> 26:57.655
Kendra, there are 600 people
in front of the White House,

26:57.783 --> 26:59.273
-and the number keeps growing.
-[Kendra] I know.

26:59.409 --> 27:01.537
Oh, my God!
| guess court didn't go well.

27:01.662 --> 27:04.074
Judge shut us down cold.
| filed for an appeal.

27:04.206 --> 27:06.823
| got documents from Lacey Cousins
that used to belong to her father,

27:06.959 --> 27:09.917
-but there's no damn filing system.
-The Ocheole are trending on Twitter.

27:10.045 --> 27:12.082
Great. Our PR problem's
getting worse by the minute.

27:12.214 --> 27:13.045
Ms. Daynes--

27:13.173 --> 27:16.541
Willens gave an interview about
how out of touch the White House is.

27:16.677 --> 27:18.463
The prison visit,
the Wannachobee project...

27:18.595 --> 27:19.710
-Ms. Daynes?
-One second.

27:19.847 --> 27:22.555
We need to turn this plane around
before it crashes into a mountain.

27:22.683 --> 27:24.424
You mean,
"before the ship hits the iceberg.”

27:24.560 --> 27:25.391
Same thing.

27:25.519 --> 27:27.430
More people die in shipwrecks
than plane crashes.

27:27.563 --> 27:28.678
More planes crash than ships wreck.

27:28.814 --> 27:30.225
-Oh, my God, you two.
-Ms. Daynes?

27:30.357 --> 27:32.724
-What is it, Tricia?
-I found something.

27:33.360 --> 27:37.149
It's a letter Ms. Cousins' father sent
to the president's architectural firm

27:37.281 --> 27:40.023
before Alton Prast broke ground
on the project.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.615
Thank you.

27:41.743 --> 27:42.733
Hmm.

27:43.453 --> 27:45.831
-[Billy] Mr. President.
-Do you recognize this?

27:47.708 --> 27:48.914
No.

27:49.042 --> 27:51.955
It's a letter addressed to me,
dated February 2000,

27:52.087 --> 27:53.703
from tribal chairman Jacob Cousins,

27:53.839 --> 27:56.752
begging me to turn down
Alton Prast's commission

27:56.884 --> 27:59.251
because of what the development
would do to his people.

27:59.887 --> 28:03.300
Except I never saw it. [inhales sharply]

28:03.432 --> 28:05.594
Only two of us were working at the time.

28:06.393 --> 28:08.100
You were handling the mail.

28:09.354 --> 28:10.856
| know this is hard to understand.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.102
All I ever wanted to do was help you.

28:14.234 --> 28:16.441
Did you deliberately withhold
this letter from me, yes or no?

28:16.570 --> 28:18.777
-Yes.
-[sighs] Why?

28:18.906 --> 28:20.067
We needed the contract.

28:20.199 --> 28:21.405
We were doing fine.

28:21.533 --> 28:24.446
No, we weren't.
You kept turning down commissions.

28:24.578 --> 28:26.615
"This development
would affect the water table.

28:26.747 --> 28:28.488
That development was racially polarizing."

28:28.624 --> 28:30.535
Because those things mattered to me, damn it!

28:30.667 --> 28:32.954
We would've gone under
and I didn't want you to fail.

28:34.379 --> 28:36.040
| didn't want us to fail.

28:36.173 --> 28:39.632
What you don't understand is we did fail.
Right then and there.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.922
An architect's first responsibility
is to the people

28:42.054 --> 28:44.762
-who are affected by his work.
-That's the wrong way to look at it.

28:44.890 --> 28:47.052
As far as I'm concerned, there is no other way.

28:47.184 --> 28:51.223
Here's one. The Wannachobee project
launched your firm.

28:51.355 --> 28:54.438
It made you one of the most
influential architects on the East Coast,

28:54.566 --> 28:57.103
which led to your academic career,
your HUD appointment,

28:57.236 --> 28:58.818
which led to this office...

28:59.821 --> 29:02.950
where you've done so much good.
Helped so many people.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.316
And if this development is the cost...

29:07.037 --> 29:07.993
[sighs]

29:08.997 --> 29:10.579
Goodbye, Billy.

29:27.557 --> 29:30.970
| appreciate your acceptance of responsibility,
Mr. President,

29:31.103 --> 29:32.935
but it doesn't solve our problem.

29:33.063 --> 29:35.725
The White House Counsel
is working to stay the injunction.

29:35.857 --> 29:38.474
Respectfully, sir, to what end?

29:38.610 --> 29:43.355
In the history of the United States, the
judiciary has given Natives next to nothing.

29:44.950 --> 29:47.112
- I know.
-Just like Congress.

29:47.244 --> 29:50.987
All these treaties that the US government broke,
failed to enforce...

29:51.957 --> 29:52.947
Treaties?

29:53.083 --> 29:56.576
Yes, sir. The Pickering Treaty.
Potawatomi Treaty.

29:56.712 --> 29:59.579
Treaty K. I can go on and on.

29:59.715 --> 30:02.173
Were the Ocheole signatories
to any of these treaties?

30:02.301 --> 30:03.507
| don't believe so, no.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.876
But they could've been.
Your people were there, right?

30:06.013 --> 30:08.505
-Sir?
-Get me Kendra Daynes, please.

30:10.434 --> 30:14.052
[Alton] A 200-year-old treaty
between Spain and the United States.

30:14.187 --> 30:17.225
-Is this some kind of a joke?
-No, Alton, it's not.

30:17.357 --> 30:19.348
In the 1700s, the kingdom of Spain

30:19.484 --> 30:21.816
made deals with the indigenous peoples
of the Florida Peninsula.

30:21.945 --> 30:23.936
In exchange for various guarantees,

30:24.072 --> 30:26.029
Spain agreed
to safeguard the tribal lands.

30:26.158 --> 30:29.526
[Emily] Spain finally ceded Florida
to the US in 1819.

30:29.661 --> 30:33.245
We took responsibility for those treaties,
which are still in play.

30:33.373 --> 30:35.455
So you're saying
the development can't proceed.

30:35.584 --> 30:38.201
I'm saying that you won't be taking
any more land from these people.

30:38.337 --> 30:39.919
Not today, tomorrow or ever.

30:40.047 --> 30:42.835
Eighteen years ago,
| took a chance on some young architect

30:42.966 --> 30:47.460
that no one had ever heard of.
| built your reputation.

30:47.596 --> 30:49.928
And now you repay me by undermining me?

30:50.057 --> 30:52.219
Let's talk about undermining.

30:52.351 --> 30:53.466
You and Billy lied to me.

30:53.602 --> 30:57.561
You concealed from me the true impact of what
our development would do to these people.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.771
What choice did I have?

30:59.900 --> 31:02.517
You always let your scruples
get in the way of progress.

31:02.652 --> 31:05.690
Billy knew that.
That's why he worked with me.

31:05.822 --> 31:08.780
Your problem wasn't my scruples.
It was your lack of them.

31:10.202 --> 31:12.443
Let's see if you can find some
on the way out.

31:18.126 --> 31:22.791
Ms. Cousins, your land will remain yours.
The treaty is binding, no matter what.

31:24.633 --> 31:26.294
| don't know how to thank you.

31:26.426 --> 31:27.757
| do.

31:27.886 --> 31:31.129
Please tell your people who are sitting out
in our hall to stand up.

31:32.140 --> 31:33.642
They can go home now.

31:34.643 --> 31:35.974
[cheering]

31:43.485 --> 31:45.476
[cheering]

31:46.530 --> 31:48.066
Um, kid...

31:48.907 --> 31:50.898
[indistinct chatter]

31:51.952 --> 31:54.410
So this isn't what we talked about at all.

31:54.538 --> 31:56.120
| know. It's better.

31:56.248 --> 32:00.663
"This is a story about how I was co-opted
by a high-ranking government official..."

32:00.794 --> 32:02.250
-That's me, I take it.
-Mm-hmm.

32:02.379 --> 32:08.045
"...bullied by a tyrannical establishment,
and how I fought for my basic rights."

32:08.176 --> 32:10.634
You said to use historical allusions.
| compared you to Mao.

32:10.762 --> 32:11.968
Mao. Yes, I got that.

32:12.097 --> 32:16.807
Uh, "All petty despots seek to trample
the free speech rights of their citizens.

32:16.935 --> 32:20.303
All free peoples must assert
their fundamental liberty."

32:21.106 --> 32:23.188
-"Trample"?
-Trample.

32:23.316 --> 32:25.808
-"Petty despot,"” huh?
-Yeah.

32:27.654 --> 32:30.521
-You know what I think?
-What?

32:31.366 --> 32:33.528
You just punched your ticket to Wesleyan.

32:36.079 --> 32:40.073
[smirks] Yeah. Tons of jeopardy
in there too. I loved it.

32:58.018 --> 32:59.508
[intruder grunts]

33:02.022 --> 33:03.808
What the hell?

33:09.738 --> 33:10.978
You're welcome.

33:11.990 --> 33:15.233
[Hannah] No prints back on our friend yet.
Car plates come back stolen.

33:15.368 --> 33:16.278
[Aaron] How'd he get in?

33:16.411 --> 33:18.527
He jumped the roof
of a neighboring complex.

33:18.663 --> 33:20.620
He entered through the vent
in the bedroom ceiling.

33:20.749 --> 33:22.865
We had him all the way.
Never any doubt.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.709
Hey, Chuck, where are we with his laptop?

33:25.837 --> 33:27.919
We recovered one from the guy's trunk.

33:28.048 --> 33:30.585
Good news, bad news situation. [sighs]

33:30.717 --> 33:33.459
The bad news is
| can't get past the firewalls.

33:35.597 --> 33:36.587
And?

33:38.099 --> 33:41.308
Right, good news. I tapped into
enough of the motherboard

33:41.436 --> 33:45.270
to recognize the same programming signature
as our previous hacks.

33:45.398 --> 33:49.392
Right. Our would-be assassin
did act more like a trained operative.

33:49.528 --> 33:52.611
My guess is he's not a techie
and the hacker gave him the laptop.

33:52.739 --> 33:56.073
And didn't want anyone accessing it
because it was a blueprint to get to me.

33:56.201 --> 33:59.865
So the space station and prison hacks,
the attempt on Damian"s life,

33:59.996 --> 34:01.578
-it's all connected?
-Yeah.

34:01.706 --> 34:02.912
You used me as bait.

34:03.917 --> 34:07.751
You leaked the intel to Valeria that I was alive
to see if the Russians wanted me dead.

34:07.879 --> 34:10.996
Yes, but they didn't. They knew
you could help us solve the hack.

34:11.132 --> 34:15.877
Which is why the hacker wanted you dead
and Russia doesn't. At least not yet.

34:16.012 --> 34:18.629
Maybe you should think twice
next time you try to get me killed.

34:18.764 --> 34:20.880
Maybe you should tell us
everything you know.

34:21.016 --> 34:23.600
The attempt on your life tells us you haven't.

34:23.728 --> 34:26.311
Let's get that laptop to IT at the bureau.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.605
IT? Fine.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.409
[Aaron] What the hell just happened?

34:38.534 --> 34:42.449
Someone hacked the battery.
Set it to overheat.

34:43.039 --> 34:44.871
Is it salvageable?

34:45.000 --> 34:46.661
I'm thinking no.

34:55.635 --> 34:57.217
[Tom] Burgers tonight, right?

34:57.345 --> 34:59.723
[indistinct chatter on TV]

34:59.848 --> 35:01.509
Dad, I need to ask you a question.

35:01.641 --> 35:03.018
Sure. What is it?

35:07.439 --> 35:08.850
Did you tell Uncle Trey to go?

35:10.400 --> 35:11.686
Is that what he said?

35:11.818 --> 35:14.105
No. He didn't say anything.

35:15.363 --> 35:18.822
| know why he's never here. It's because
you don't make him feel welcome.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.611
It's not that simple, Leo.

35:20.744 --> 35:23.862
You and Uncle Trey,
you're exactly the same.

35:26.249 --> 35:28.741
If Penny and I weren't on good terms,
what would you do?

35:28.877 --> 35:31.710
-You wouldn't stand for it, right?
-Leo--

35:31.838 --> 35:35.206
No, no.
You're always talking about family.

35:36.343 --> 35:37.549
But what about ours?

35:39.304 --> 35:42.262
Mom's gone. Grandma moved back to Paris.

35:42.390 --> 35:45.132
We need Uncle Trey in our lives.

35:45.268 --> 35:48.681
But every time one of you walks in,
the other walks right back out.

35:50.106 --> 35:53.940
That's not what family does, right?

35:54.069 --> 35:55.059
[smacks lips]

35:56.613 --> 35:58.820
No, it's not.

36:04.287 --> 36:07.200
[sighs] We should be hearing applause
over the Ocheole resolution,

36:07.332 --> 36:09.198
but we're not because
it's not getting any press.

36:09.334 --> 36:10.574
Because it's prison-palooza.

36:10.710 --> 36:12.951
[Seth] He's right, Em.
Three news cycles in a row.

36:13.088 --> 36:16.251
Rampant speculation about the president's
state of mind, fitness.

36:16.383 --> 36:19.751
We either put this behind us
or it starts defining his presidency.

36:19.886 --> 36:23.880
Look, guys, we've been over this.
The president isn't going to address it.

36:24.015 --> 36:26.177
[Tom] Yes, the president is.

36:28.645 --> 36:31.012
| wanna thank you all for bearing with me.

36:31.147 --> 36:33.309
I'm still pretty new at this.

36:33.441 --> 36:35.432
And sometimes I forget, as president,

36:35.568 --> 36:38.856
my actions are seen around the world
and I have to be held accountable for them.

36:38.988 --> 36:41.025
Answer for them, even if I don't want to.

36:41.157 --> 36:42.409
You'll issue a statement?

36:42.992 --> 36:44.903
I'm prepared to do more than that.

36:48.665 --> 36:49.905
Thank you.

36:59.342 --> 37:01.925
Good evening, my fellow Americans.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.841
Many of you have seen
a video of me confronting the man

37:04.973 --> 37:08.432
whose negligence
resulted in my wife's death.

37:08.560 --> 37:13.020
That visit was unfair to a man
who had already been tried and convicted

37:13.148 --> 37:16.015
and unbecoming
to the holder of this office.

37:17.110 --> 37:18.646
[sighs softly]

37:18.778 --> 37:20.769
| am your president.

37:21.740 --> 37:26.075
But I am also a man who recently
lost his wife of 18 years.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.949
| struggle with that every day.

37:30.915 --> 37:33.907
And sometimes,
that struggle gets the better of me.

37:35.628 --> 37:37.369
But I make you this vow.

37:40.008 --> 37:43.717
| will work every day
trying to be a better man tomorrow

37:43.845 --> 37:45.677
than I was the day before.

37:45.805 --> 37:47.512
And a better president.

37:48.475 --> 37:51.342
Because that's what
the American people deserve.

37:53.354 --> 37:57.473
| can only hope that you can understand
and accept my apology.

37:59.152 --> 38:00.893
God bless you.

38:01.029 --> 38:04.238
And God bless
these United States of America.

38:04.365 --> 38:05.651
[man] And we're clear.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.149
[whispers] That'll do.

38:11.080 --> 38:12.991
| was at the gate when I got the call.

38:13.124 --> 38:16.708
| know. I'm glad they caught you.
Please, sit.

38:18.838 --> 38:21.626
| saw your apology. It was good.

38:21.758 --> 38:23.999
Thank you. That was the public one.

38:24.886 --> 38:28.675
| owe a private one. To you.

38:30.517 --> 38:31.723
You don't.

38:32.393 --> 38:35.226
Yeah, I do, Trey. [sighs]

38:35.355 --> 38:37.892
I'm your older brother.
I'm supposed to help you get through things.

38:39.651 --> 38:43.360
Whatever happened,
whatever I think happened,

38:43.488 --> 38:47.573
| need to let go of. I need to move on.
It doesn't matter anymore.

38:49.327 --> 38:50.863
"Cause we're family.

38:53.373 --> 38:54.363
Yeah.

38:57.252 --> 39:00.961
You know what it's like having
Tom Kirkman as your brother?

39:01.089 --> 39:04.957
Eagle Scout. Summa cum laude.
Rhodes scholar.

39:05.093 --> 39:08.085
No one ever expected you
to do all those things.

39:08.221 --> 39:10.132
[chuckles wistfully]

39:10.265 --> 39:11.721
Because I couldn't.

39:13.226 --> 39:16.469
It's why I stopped trying.
It's why I got into trouble.

39:16.604 --> 39:18.390
Just figured, if I couldn't be good, then...

39:19.482 --> 39:21.064
Might as well be bad.

39:22.110 --> 39:23.225
Yeah.

39:24.612 --> 39:28.856
[inhales sharply] I think I figured out
why Alex wanted you as a trustee.

39:29.784 --> 39:34.153
It was her way of, one day,
bringing us back together.

39:34.289 --> 39:35.996
Making sure I could look out for you.

39:36.124 --> 39:38.491
| think she wanted me to look out for you.

39:38.626 --> 39:40.162
[chuckles]

39:41.170 --> 39:42.126
Seriously?

39:42.922 --> 39:46.210
Alex called me
right when you got sworn in.

39:46.342 --> 39:49.130
She said you had the loneliest job
in the world.

39:54.851 --> 39:58.139
I... I miss her so much, Trey.

40:05.028 --> 40:07.315
| lost one of my oldest friends today.

40:09.157 --> 40:11.194
| don't wanna lose anyone else.

40:11.326 --> 40:15.194
You never lost me, Tom.
| just couldn't find my way back.

40:16.122 --> 40:18.113
| promise you, I won't run again.

40:19.876 --> 40:20.866
Okay.

40:23.171 --> 40:26.960
[sighs] I don't know
exactly what to do right now.

40:27.091 --> 40:30.755
Me neither. But we'll do it together.

40:32.096 --> 40:33.211
Yeah.

40:34.724 --> 40:35.759
Yeah.
