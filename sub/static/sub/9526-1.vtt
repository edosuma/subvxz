because they ruin "verginas."

06:46.323 --> 06:47.950
"Verginas."

you or the baby?

07:08.762 --> 07:10.389
- Dude, this sucks!
- Should I?

07:10.514 --> 07:12.975
- I had my massive Ders effect
drops, right?

07:13.100 --> 07:16.437
And now DJ Ango is chained.
He's chained.

07:16.562 --> 07:18.313
He's never-
- The DJ is fully chained.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.441
And I was gonna have
a natural dance body

07:20.566 --> 07:21.608
that was gonna be showing off.

07:21.734 --> 07:24.028
I was planting seeds,
I was gonna exude energy

07:24.153 --> 07:26.238

07:26.363 --> 07:28.323

ruined it!

Stupid baby.
I hate babies.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.954
It's not fair!
- I know, I know, I know.

07:34.079 --> 07:35.789
- You know,
all we need is, like,

07:35.914 --> 07:38.125
a big distraction
so that we can sneak Tez out

07:38.250 --> 07:39.293
and go to the festival.

07:39.418 --> 07:40.711
That's all we need.

around here, okay?

08:24.296 --> 08:25.339
You know,
I'm eight months pregnant,

08:30.135 --> 08:33.679
I'm going to give you
a terrific baby shower, okay?

Let me do that for you.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.559
It's Colleen, right?

08:51.740 --> 08:53.784
with some really killer tunes.

08:53.909 --> 08:56.453

but skinny.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.219
And girls like that.
Come on, now.
