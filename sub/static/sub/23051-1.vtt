00:14.115 --> 00:16.782
[sighs]
It's not even December yet,

00:16.817 --> 00:20.052
and they're already playing
Christmas music on the radio.

00:21.822 --> 00:24.490
Topher?

00:24.525 --> 00:27.593
Topher, what kinda
silly nickname is that?

00:27.628 --> 00:29.294
You oughta be using
your given name.

00:29.330 --> 00:33.165
Or "Chris,"
if you want to shorten it.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.468
Are those Christmas cookies?

00:36.504 --> 00:37.936
Yes, sir, Mr. Furlong.

00:37.972 --> 00:40.339
Do you want one?
They're really good.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.307
You need a haircut.

00:42.343 --> 00:43.609
I don't eat cookies.

00:43.644 --> 00:46.311
Thanksgiving
was just two days ago,

00:46.347 --> 00:49.648
and already we're putting out
Christmas cookies.

00:49.683 --> 00:52.785
It's almost December,
and then it will be Christmas.

00:52.820 --> 00:55.187
I'm so excited.
I can't wait, Brooke.

00:55.222 --> 00:57.256
Me too, Paige.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.091
[bell jingles]

00:59.126 --> 01:01.760
Hello, Mr. Furlong.
Are you excited for Christmas?

01:01.796 --> 01:04.462
Do you have a Christmas tree
at your house? We do.

01:04.498 --> 01:05.931
It has an angel on the top.

01:05.966 --> 01:07.499
Have you ever been
to the North Pole?

01:07.535 --> 01:09.701
It's cold there.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.336
Hey!

01:11.372 --> 01:13.005
I'm looking for
Christmas cards.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.106
They're right over here.

01:17.244 --> 01:18.844
Great. Thanks.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.279
No problem.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.547
I'm getting it now.
Hold on.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.248
Hey, I need a bag of oranges.

01:23.284 --> 01:27.886
Topher, quit flirting.
Get this man a bag of oranges.

01:29.924 --> 01:31.790
Did you pick out your snack?

01:31.826 --> 01:35.828
We're all gonna have
a very merry Christmas.

01:37.064 --> 01:38.230
[clears throat]

01:42.203 --> 01:43.302
Thank you.

01:44.705 --> 01:45.904
PAIGE: Bye!

01:46.907 --> 01:48.507
Bah humbug!

01:54.415 --> 01:56.682
- Hey, my darlings!
- Hi, Mom.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.484
Thanks for getting Paige
from school for me.

01:58.519 --> 01:59.818
BROOKE: You're welcome.

01:59.854 --> 02:02.154
- [quacking]
- [laughing]

02:02.189 --> 02:04.423
- How's everybody today?
- Good.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.425
We got Christmas cookies
at Furlong's.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.161
The old man that works there
is always so grumpy.

02:09.196 --> 02:10.996
Well, then go someplace else.

02:11.031 --> 02:12.197
Brooke likes the boy there.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.532
I do not.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.167
You're always talking to him.

02:15.202 --> 02:19.071
Hey, babe, Aunt Shannon,

02:19.106 --> 02:21.573
Uncle Matt and kids
are coming for Christmas.

02:21.609 --> 02:23.019
Aunt Eileen and
her family's coming too,

02:23.043 --> 02:25.344
so that makes 18.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.779
Wow. We got a lot
we gotta do.

02:27.815 --> 02:30.782
Oh, and my brother wants to know
if he can bring his dog.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.051
- Jim!
- I'll tell him no.

02:33.087 --> 02:34.920
Thank you, sir.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.555
These look good.

02:44.465 --> 02:47.566
Only one more week of school,
then it's Christmas vacation.

02:47.601 --> 02:49.535
That's right.

02:52.940 --> 02:55.073
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:56.577 --> 02:57.843
What are you doing?

02:57.878 --> 03:00.646
Oh, just counting receipts.

03:04.318 --> 03:06.618
I made this for you at school.

03:06.654 --> 03:08.720
Oh, my goodness.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.822
That's nice.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.224
[laughs]

03:14.128 --> 03:16.168
We have like a dozen relatives
coming for Christmas,

03:16.197 --> 03:18.964
and my mom is going crazy.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.299
What are your plans?

03:20.334 --> 03:21.667
Not much.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.635
Dad's gone on deployment.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.971
I'll spend the morning with
my mom before she has to work.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.472
Topher!

03:27.508 --> 03:29.441
Go and finish that inventory.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.444
Okay, Fred.

03:36.483 --> 03:40.819
Ah! Grandpa Bodell's
chocolate pie.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.454
God rest his soul.

03:42.489 --> 03:44.189
We'll save this one for dinner.

03:44.225 --> 03:47.526
And, Paige, the chocolate
goes in the pie crust,

03:47.561 --> 03:48.794
not your mouth.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.963
I am putting it
in the pie crust.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.264
- Mm-hmm.
- [phone chimes]

03:52.299 --> 03:54.032
That's probably your dad,
Brooke.

03:54.068 --> 03:55.167
You sure about that?

03:55.202 --> 03:57.169
Dad's leaving work right now.

03:57.204 --> 03:58.604
Oh, and Aunt Anne, Jack,

03:58.639 --> 04:00.172
and kids are coming
for Christmas too.

04:00.207 --> 04:01.640
- More?
- Yeah.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.442
Gonna need more pies.

04:03.477 --> 04:06.778
Remind me to order another ham
and more of everything else.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.013
- Okay.
- All right.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.982
Watch the chocolate.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.459
- Yep.
- I made this Christmas card

04:21.495 --> 04:22.995
in art class.

04:23.030 --> 04:26.064
What did you get me?
Give me a hint.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.233
Your present is...

04:28.269 --> 04:30.569
that you can pick out anything
you want at Furlong's.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.505
I can pick out anything I want
in Furlong's?

04:33.540 --> 04:36.208
Absolutely.
Whatever you want.

04:36.243 --> 04:38.343
Pinky promise?

04:40.214 --> 04:41.713
Yeah.

04:45.252 --> 04:47.052
Where's Mr. Furlong?

04:47.087 --> 04:49.154
He's over there,
taking a coffee break.

04:49.189 --> 04:50.989
You have your list?

04:51.025 --> 04:53.025
Yeah. My mom is in
total panic-mode

04:53.060 --> 04:54.671
because our second-cousins,
who we never see,

04:54.695 --> 04:56.539
called last minute
and are coming for Christmas.

04:56.563 --> 04:57.929
I'll help you find everything.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.998
I know what I want
for my present.

05:00.034 --> 05:02.401
I want you to invite
Mr. Furlong to our house.

05:02.436 --> 05:03.869
What?

05:03.904 --> 05:05.871
You said I could have
anything in the market,

05:05.906 --> 05:07.172
and he's in the market.

05:07.207 --> 05:08.874
Paige, no.
Mom's gonna kill us

05:08.909 --> 05:11.310
if we invite any more people
to our house on Christmas.

05:11.345 --> 05:13.445
You pinky promised, Brooke.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.522
Excuse me, Mr. Furlong.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.357
My sister Paige
would like to invite you

05:25.392 --> 05:27.225
to our house for Christmas.

05:27.261 --> 05:30.696
Well, I don't know
what to say.

05:30.731 --> 05:31.930
Then you'll come?

05:34.001 --> 05:35.400
Well, uh...

05:35.436 --> 05:37.602
I...

05:37.638 --> 05:39.771
I'm not sure that I can.

05:41.175 --> 05:43.742
Paige, we gotta get home.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.210
Mom's waiting for us.

05:47.314 --> 05:49.214
I made you a Christmas card.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.417
Thank you.

05:54.421 --> 05:56.254
Merry Christmas.

05:56.290 --> 05:58.457
Merry Christmas.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.233
He will.
I know he will.

06:08.335 --> 06:09.968
[doorbell rings]

06:11.872 --> 06:13.872
- Hey!
- Hi!

06:13.974 --> 06:15.540
Merry Christmas!
Hi, baby!

06:15.642 --> 06:18.510
There she is!
Hi, Paige!

06:18.612 --> 06:21.213
Merry Christmas!

06:54.615 --> 06:56.281
[doorbell rings]

06:56.383 --> 06:59.151
I'll get it, I'll get it.

06:59.253 --> 07:00.585
Hello.

07:00.687 --> 07:03.422
- Oh, hi.
- [Mr. Furlong chuckles]

07:03.524 --> 07:06.258
I hope you don't mind.
I brought someone with me.

07:06.360 --> 07:07.426
Merry Christmas.

07:07.528 --> 07:08.760
Hi.

07:11.198 --> 07:12.931
- Oh.
- Sorry, Mom.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.800
Paige invited Mr. Furlong
over for dinner,

07:14.902 --> 07:16.435
and Topher came with him.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.503
- I...
- It's fine, it's fine.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.539
I'm Madison.
This is my husband Jim.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.707
- How you doing?
- Hello, Jim.

07:22.810 --> 07:25.310
We're so happy that you could
join us, Mr. Furlong.

07:25.412 --> 07:26.978
And you too, Topher.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.615
Please, just call me Fred.
I hope I'm not imposing.

07:30.717 --> 07:33.718
No, not at all.
"The more the merrier"

07:33.821 --> 07:35.353
is our Christmas motto
this year.

07:35.456 --> 07:37.556
Well, all right.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.191
Well, I brought you some things.

07:39.293 --> 07:42.160
Oh, my goodness.
Lookit there.

07:42.262 --> 07:45.063
Just what I needed.
You are my savior, Fred.

07:45.165 --> 07:46.631
Make yourself at home.
I'll be back.

07:46.733 --> 07:48.567
- Thank you.
- All right.

07:49.803 --> 07:50.969
More potatoes, Fred?

07:51.071 --> 07:52.337
[sighs]
I'm full.

07:52.439 --> 07:53.538
[laughing]

07:54.908 --> 07:56.842
It was delicious.

07:56.944 --> 07:58.310
Thank you.

07:58.412 --> 08:00.412
Will you see your family
this week?

08:00.514 --> 08:03.014
It's just me now.

08:03.116 --> 08:05.650
My wife passed six years ago.

08:05.752 --> 08:08.053
JIM: Oh, sorry.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.889
Well, we're very happy
to have you here with us, Fred.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.424
Especially Paige, right?

08:12.526 --> 08:14.759
- Yeah.
- I appreciate that.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.595
[Fred laughs]

08:16.697 --> 08:18.897
Feels good to be here.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.099
Good. Hey!

08:21.201 --> 08:23.502
- Anybody ready for our dessert?
- Yes!

08:23.604 --> 08:26.738
How about Grandpa Bodell's
famous chocolate pie?

08:26.840 --> 08:29.140
[cheering]

08:32.880 --> 08:34.712
This is for you.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.681
Oh?

08:36.783 --> 08:39.918
It's a paperweight, so your
receipts won't blow away.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.587
That's exactly what I need.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.923
And the artwork is excellent.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.424
I painted it myself.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.293
Thank you, Paige.

08:48.395 --> 08:50.862
Paige, it's your turn
to open up a present.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.098
I already have
my Christmas present.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.066
It's Fred.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.636
I'm your Christmas present?

08:57.738 --> 09:00.405
- Uh-huh.
- Me?

09:00.507 --> 09:05.143
You mean to tell me you'd rather
pick a grumpy old man

09:05.245 --> 09:08.280
than have a brand-new doll
or a game?

09:08.382 --> 09:10.382
Pop died when I was a baby,

09:10.484 --> 09:13.251
and I never got to meet
Grandpa Bodell.

09:13.353 --> 09:16.154
For Christmas,
I wanted a grandpa of my own.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.990
Well, I am truly honored.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.660
Family picture time.
Picture time!

09:21.762 --> 09:23.261
I'll take the picture.

09:23.363 --> 09:26.464
I don't think
Paige would allow that.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.077
You got that right.
All right, everyone.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.501
Get in here, get in tight.

09:29.603 --> 09:32.003
We'll have a cute little
Christmas selfie.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.438
- Alrighty.
- All right.

09:33.540 --> 09:35.307
- Get in there.
- Merry Christmas on three.

09:35.409 --> 09:38.476
Y'all ready? On three.
One, two...

09:38.579 --> 09:40.645
Merry Christmas!
