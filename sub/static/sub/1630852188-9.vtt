Good thing you were able to get me

02:24.102 --> 02:26.646
Yeah. Real good thing.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.816
Had to keep it interesting,
huh, superstar?

02:32.819 --> 02:33.820
Huh?

02:34.612 --> 02:37.407
Okay, come on, guys.
Who knows when Kash is gonna wake up.

[tense music]

02:57.093 --> 02:58.636
[elevator dings]

This will take you down to the Med Bay.
There's a nursery next to it.

03:01.890 --> 03:05.184
He's testing the control chips on
the baby dinos first thing in the morning.

03:05.268 --> 03:06.644
What about cameras?

03:06.728 --> 03:08.313
Mr. Genius has been too busy

03:08.396 --> 03:10.690
to get the island's
camera system up and running.

03:10.773 --> 03:13.484
Message me on the BRAD-X
as soon as you get the babies out.

03:13.985 --> 03:14.944
Good luck.

03:21.451 --> 03:22.911
[Kash] What are you doing out here?

03:24.370 --> 03:26.706
Oh, Kash, hey.
[chuckles]

03:26.789 --> 03:30.251
Uh, you know how hard it is to sleep
when you got a metal babysitter's

03:30.335 --> 03:32.420
big ole eye slits
staring at you all night?

03:33.755 --> 03:35.381
[sighs]
Not my problem.

03:36.174 --> 03:39.886
Actually, no, it is.
Because we're having this conversation.

03:39.969 --> 03:43.306
Yeah, I, uh… I went up
to the roof to get some air.

03:43.389 --> 03:47.185
Let the machine do the answering.
Where did the kid go?

03:47.268 --> 03:48.770
[in robotic voice]
<i>The roof.</i>

03:49.479 --> 03:50.647
Uh-huh.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.066
And was he doing anything
he shouldn't have been?

03:53.650 --> 03:54.776
<i>Negative.</i>

03:56.778 --> 03:58.571
Escort him back to his room.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.740
Then bring my cold brew
down to the nursery.

04:00.823 --> 04:03.910
Since the kid woke me up,
might as well get some work done.

04:04.744 --> 04:07.580
Dude, come on, please
don't make me go back to my room.

04:07.664 --> 04:11.459
I'm so bored.
Can I play a video game or something?

04:12.085 --> 04:13.336
You're a gamer?

04:14.337 --> 04:16.547
That's how I won my trip
to Jurassic World.

04:16.631 --> 04:18.591
I'm kinda… awesome.

04:19.175 --> 04:20.510
Doubtful.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.013
That's cool. Most of my friends
were scared to play me too.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.517
Who said I was scared?

04:58.798 --> 05:00.800
[ominous music]

05:03.344 --> 05:06.139
Looks like there's only three
baby dinos in the nursery.

05:11.477 --> 05:12.562
[chimes]

05:12.645 --> 05:18.067
"Baby Brachiosaurus. Two months old.
DNA extracted from Isla Sorna."

05:18.151 --> 05:20.570
It won't take me long.
Where we meeting after?

05:20.653 --> 05:22.530
Med Bay. We'll load 'em up on a platform,

05:22.613 --> 05:25.116
and figure out which biome
to take them to later.

05:28.286 --> 05:31.205
All right. Usual teams?
Let's see what we're dealing with, but--

05:31.289 --> 05:33.833
-Actually, Yaz and I got this one.
-Hmm?

05:36.502 --> 05:38.713
Like I was saying, Sammy, we're up.

05:39.380 --> 05:40.757
[beeping]

05:41.340 --> 05:42.216
Huh?

05:42.800 --> 05:48.181
"Sinoceratops and Spinosaurus."
Dummy put down two species by mistake.

05:49.223 --> 05:52.101
[Sammy] Nope. It's a hybrid.

05:53.102 --> 05:55.646
What's everyone's obsession
with making hybrids?

05:56.147 --> 06:01.611
Says, "the Sinoceratops DNA was extracted
from live specimen on Isla Nublar."

06:01.694 --> 06:02.653
[gasps]

06:04.906 --> 06:05.948
[Kenji] Sammy!

06:20.171 --> 06:21.798
I'm so sorry.

06:24.342 --> 06:25.426
[Kash] Okay, kid.

06:25.510 --> 06:26.761
Hope you're ready for this.

06:26.844 --> 06:28.137
[Darius] Oh, I'm ready.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.223
[chiming]

06:30.306 --> 06:32.600
The Jurassic World Video Game.

06:33.101 --> 06:35.937
Gotta say, there's something
funny about playing a game

06:36.020 --> 06:38.523
where we run from dinosaurs
when, you know,

06:38.606 --> 06:40.483
we're on an island filled with dinosaurs.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.777
Eh, I prefer this way.

06:42.860 --> 06:45.863
I can eat nachos
while I own these punk lizards.

06:46.364 --> 06:50.910
No, totally, totally.
I love punking dinosaurs.

06:50.993 --> 06:53.579
It's probably why
I'm so unbeatable at this game.

06:53.663 --> 06:56.707
-Yeah. We'll see about that.
-Ready to race?

[Brooklynn imitates baby talk]
I promise

07:49.969 --> 07:52.305
it's some place really, really special.

07:52.388 --> 07:54.682
[whimpers]

07:55.558 --> 07:58.603
[Brooklynn]
Don't tell anyone about the baby talk.

07:58.686 --> 08:00.062
No promises.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.690
You might wanna avoid
everyone for a while.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.610
Like you did earlier. With Kenji.

08:06.819 --> 08:09.989
What? You're imagining things.

08:12.742 --> 08:13.784
[sighs]

08:13.868 --> 08:16.120
Kenji said he likes me, okay?

08:17.371 --> 08:18.247
[whimpers]

08:18.331 --> 08:22.001
And then I got all weird
so he backtracked, and it got weirder.

08:22.084 --> 08:24.378
And now I don't know
if he meant it or not.

08:25.213 --> 08:27.465
Do you want him to mean it?

08:30.384 --> 08:32.053
[slurps]

08:33.554 --> 08:34.805
[Sammy] Poor thing.

08:34.889 --> 08:39.727
Here all by yourself.
How about we get you out of here?

08:39.810 --> 08:41.854
[low growl]

08:41.938 --> 08:44.857
Oh, okay, okay. No rush.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.068
You take all the time you need.

08:47.151 --> 08:50.738
Actually, there is a rush.
We need to go. Now.

08:50.821 --> 08:51.697
[dinosaur grumbles]

08:51.781 --> 08:53.157
All right. Let's go.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.158
Ow!

08:54.242 --> 08:57.245
Kenji! Don't rush the little angel.

08:57.828 --> 09:00.331
She bit me.
And you're calling her an angel?

09:00.414 --> 09:01.832
That's right.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.709
[Sammy] I'm naming you "Angel".

09:04.210 --> 09:07.338
Oh, don't you listen
to Mr. Insensitive over there.

09:07.421 --> 09:10.174
[grumbles]
Girls. You try to be nice,

09:10.258 --> 09:14.011
they either snub you or they bite you.
You just can't win.

Hey! It's okay, dude.

09:37.326 --> 09:40.371

running from dinosaurs as I have.

-I'm over this. Take him to his room.
-[BRAD beeping]

09:45.960 --> 09:48.337
Come on, I'll take it easier
on you this time.

09:49.171 --> 09:50.339
Are you…
[scoffs]

09:50.423 --> 09:53.217
I wasn't even trying.
I just have work to do.

09:53.301 --> 09:58.347
Okay. Whatevs.
Just sounds like someone hates to lose.

Bumpy was all about the berries,

10:56.197 --> 10:58.366

All right. Let's try it your way.

Sounds like someone hates to lose.

It's okay, girl. Let it all out.

11:47.915 --> 11:50.543
What? No. Someone could hear her.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.461
Let her feel her feelings.

[Kenji grumbles]
Feelings? Ah, I give up.

that could tell me what every girl

I don't know, sometimes, I feel like
he gets me better than anyone else.

What's me?

12:30.958 --> 12:34.753
Here. Now. Uh, we, uh, heard you.

12:34.837 --> 12:37.506
-[Sammy grunts]
-[whines]

12:38.257 --> 12:41.886
Yeah, I think everyone
in a five-mile radius heard this little--

12:41.969 --> 12:43.053
Angel.

12:43.137 --> 12:46.223
That's what you were gonna say,
right, Kenj?

12:46.891 --> 12:47.725
Nope.

12:48.767 --> 12:50.186
[squeals]

12:50.269 --> 12:52.813
[shrill cry]

12:56.567 --> 12:57.818
[laughs]

12:57.902 --> 12:59.987
Look at 'em. Must be siblings.

13:00.696 --> 13:02.615
[both squealing]

13:02.698 --> 13:04.783
It's cute until we get caught.

13:04.867 --> 13:07.745
If we're gonna keep moving,
we need to separate them.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.459
-[all grunting]
-[dinosaurs whine]

13:17.129 --> 13:19.548
Maybe we'll have better luck
if we switch it up.

13:19.632 --> 13:20.925
Sammy and I will take Angel.

13:21.008 --> 13:24.220
You guys go first to the Med Bay.
We'll give it a few and then follow.

13:25.554 --> 13:28.224
Sure. Let's go.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.980
[snorting]

13:41.362 --> 13:42.863
[purring]

13:48.536 --> 13:50.663
Sammy, do your animal thing.

13:50.746 --> 13:55.417
Aw, give her a minute.
She just needs some love.

13:55.501 --> 13:59.713
I bet all she's ever got
is a cold, uncaring BRAD claw.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.007
Okay, what's the deal?

14:04.051 --> 14:05.261
Sammy?

14:07.805 --> 14:10.266
Angel's here because of me.

14:11.183 --> 14:12.893
And so is her brother.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.771
They were made from the samples
I stole from Nublar.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.649
They spent their whole lives down here.

14:19.191 --> 14:22.069
No sunlight, no fresh air,

14:22.653 --> 14:24.572
all because of me.

14:24.655 --> 14:25.698
[dinosaur whines]

14:25.781 --> 14:29.285
Sammy, you may have taken the sample,
under threat, by the way,

14:29.368 --> 14:32.788
but it's Mantah Corp's fault
for doing all this to the animals.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.332
Coddling Angel isn't gonna help her.

14:35.416 --> 14:38.919
But getting her out of here,
saving her from Kash, that will.

14:39.628 --> 14:40.880
[Ben] Can't catch me!

14:42.548 --> 14:46.969
Come on! What are you guys doing?
Let's get a move on.

14:49.471 --> 14:52.600
Now, you listen to me.
I'm sorry you had it rough,

14:52.683 --> 14:55.561
but if you ever want a better life,
you are gonna move.

14:55.644 --> 14:57.354

15:03.193 --> 15:05.946
[dinosaur whines]

15:09.575 --> 15:11.577
-What are you doing?
-We need to cover our tracks

15:11.660 --> 15:13.996
so it looks like the dinosaurs
got out on their own.

15:16.165 --> 15:18.375
How about that? We could blow a fuse.

15:18.459 --> 15:21.253
Yeah, as long as it's the right one.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.379
[door closes]

15:26.467 --> 15:28.552
Oh! Oh! Huh?

15:29.803 --> 15:31.013
That's right, little lady.

15:31.096 --> 15:33.766
You move your sassy behind
right on up to that platform.

[Darius] Not again!

16:34.326 --> 16:35.911
[upbeat music]

16:35.995 --> 16:40.290
A dance break? Are you kidding me?
How is there even a cheat code for that?

16:40.374 --> 16:44.920
Don't make excuses for your failures, kid.
Just, like, be better.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.672
-[beeping]
-Huh?

16:48.215 --> 16:49.883
[Kash] Power outage in the Med Bay.

16:50.634 --> 16:51.719
[gasps]

16:52.678 --> 16:55.264
Wait. I gotta know how you hacked
the game like that.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.099
Earned a new respect for me, eh?

16:57.182 --> 16:59.727
Yeah, I thought I was good,
but it was like,

16:59.810 --> 17:02.187
you taught the game
how it was supposed to be played.

17:02.271 --> 17:03.397
Show me how?

17:03.480 --> 17:06.483
Nah. Maybe later.
I gotta check things out down there.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.530
What do you think you're doing?

17:11.613 --> 17:15.409
How am I supposed to "be better"
if I'm not learning from the best?

17:16.660 --> 17:19.621
Fine. But keep to yourself
and don't be annoying.

17:22.082 --> 17:24.418

Come on!

18:56.343 --> 18:57.302
I hate waiting too.

18:57.386 --> 18:58.387
Let's go play some more.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.931
I mean, I'm guessing
power outages happen all the time.
