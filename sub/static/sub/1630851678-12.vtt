00:53.921 --> 00:55.689
In the name of justice,

00:55.723 --> 00:58.058
your reign of terror
is over, Buffer Fish!

00:58.092 --> 01:02.696
Why fight me Tarantu-Lad?
When you should join me!

01:02.730 --> 01:03.731
What?

01:04.932 --> 01:08.536
Like me, you'll never
be accepted by this world.

01:08.569 --> 01:11.672
If that is my fate,
then so be it!

01:18.912 --> 01:22.116
You will never be loved.

01:34.027 --> 01:35.429
All this time...

01:35.463 --> 01:36.830
He's a monster!

01:40.634 --> 01:44.104
I don't care what you are.
To me, you're a hero!

01:46.006 --> 01:51.345
Mother, Father,
I've finally found my home.

01:56.517 --> 01:59.953
And that was <i>
The World I Call Home.</i>

01:59.987 --> 02:03.991
Quite possibly
the finest film ever made.

02:04.024 --> 02:07.161
I-- I've never seen
anything like that!

02:07.195 --> 02:11.765
So moving! So inspiring!

02:11.799 --> 02:15.836
I wish I could be
lovingly embraced
by all of humanity.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.540
No can do, dude.
Low profile, remember?

02:19.573 --> 02:22.643
I know, I know,
but it's not fair.

02:22.676 --> 02:24.378
You got to make your mark
in Amphibia!

02:24.412 --> 02:27.114
That's because in Amphibia,
we weren't in hiding.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.982
Fine.

02:29.016 --> 02:31.852
I still can't believe you guys
actually liked that movie!

02:31.885 --> 02:34.722
It was stuffed
with predictable tropes
and lazy writing.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.990
We have got to cut back
on your Internet use.

02:37.024 --> 02:39.026
All I'm sayin' is that you'd
have to be pretty dense

02:39.059 --> 02:41.295
to think any of that
would be possible.

02:41.329 --> 02:44.465
First of all,
the idea that a vigilante
would be given free reign...

02:44.498 --> 02:48.068
<i>He was just
a mild-mannered frog boy
who never made a fuss.</i>

02:50.371 --> 02:53.173
But he was destined
to be something more...

03:07.054 --> 03:10.758
Who knows how long he's got left
on Earth?

03:10.791 --> 03:14.295
<i>It's time to put his mark
on the world
and be adored by all!</i>

03:22.403 --> 03:27.575
<i>All right, Earth.
Get ready to meet Frog-Man!</i>

03:27.608 --> 03:29.076
Hey Sprig, did you see--

03:31.044 --> 03:32.680
What are you doing?

03:32.713 --> 03:37.685
I'm fulfilling my destiny
as Frog-Man,
your neighborhood superhero!

03:37.718 --> 03:40.187
You mean
neighborhood attention-seeker.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.189
The only thing I seek
is justice!

03:42.222 --> 03:44.458
Hop, hop and away!

03:44.492 --> 03:48.429
You're never going to
solve systemic societal problems
with a sock on your head!

03:51.131 --> 03:56.304
<i>Here I am.
Guardian of the city.
No evil shall escape my gaze.</i>

03:59.673 --> 04:00.874
Whoa, whoa!

04:00.908 --> 04:02.976
Totally meant to do that.

04:03.010 --> 04:07.080
And now to search for crime.
All right,
I'm writing you kids up.

04:07.114 --> 04:08.949
You need a permit
to sell goods
on this street.

04:08.982 --> 04:11.919
Mom's gonna hate this.
Dude, we're eight.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.655
What seems to be
the problem here?

04:14.688 --> 04:18.326
Who are you?
Some kind of masked vigilante?

04:18.359 --> 04:20.294
Exactly. I am...

04:22.095 --> 04:25.198
Frog-Man!
Ribbiter of Justice!

04:27.835 --> 04:31.572
Well, these streets
don't need you,
'cause they've got me!

04:31.605 --> 04:36.410
Robert Otto,
Neighborhood Safety Supervisor.

04:36.444 --> 04:38.312
More like
Neighborhood Butt Cheek.

04:38.346 --> 04:42.082
Listen, this neighborhood
ain't big enough
for the both of us.

04:42.115 --> 04:45.118
And I was here first,
so get lost!

04:45.152 --> 04:49.022
Hey, I don't want to fight you.
I only want to fight injustice!

04:50.057 --> 04:51.892
Someone's in trouble!

04:53.961 --> 04:56.464
This neighborhood's
finally hit rock bottom.

05:07.808 --> 05:12.079
It's okay!
Your Neighborhood Safety
Supervisor is here--

05:13.481 --> 05:14.982
Hit the brakes!

05:15.015 --> 05:17.585
They're out!
And now I can't even see!

05:22.222 --> 05:24.257
Not so fast!
Tongue web!

05:35.168 --> 05:37.838
Ow!
Oh, my gosh. That kid did it.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.172
What a hero!

05:39.206 --> 05:43.143
Hey, what about me? I mean,
I slowed the bus down first.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.145
- Hey, hey. Way to go, kiddo.

05:45.178 --> 05:49.016
Please. Citizens, please.
It was nothing.

05:50.584 --> 05:54.655
Molly Jo? You were in that bus?
Oh, thank goodness you're safe.

05:54.688 --> 05:58.191
Thank you, Frog-Man,
for saving me
and my Grandpa Robert!

05:58.225 --> 06:00.360
Oh, no problem.

06:00.394 --> 06:01.762
Uh.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.564
What the--
Sorry, just gotta--

06:03.597 --> 06:05.032
There we go.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.103
Stupid Frog-Man.

06:16.444 --> 06:19.212
Look out, LA,
there's a new frog superhero
in town!

06:29.457 --> 06:31.425
Sprig!

06:45.506 --> 06:50.544
I've been taking care
of this neighborhood for years,
and what do I get? Nothing!

06:50.578 --> 06:54.582
Hmm. If only I could prove
Frog-Man is a joke.

06:54.615 --> 06:57.050
What's this?

06:57.084 --> 07:00.220
It's some kind of
high-tech mechanical arm.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.989
Oh ho ho!

07:03.457 --> 07:05.526
Surprisingly light.

07:07.995 --> 07:10.498
Yet so powerful.
And a perfect fit.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.600
This must be fate!

07:12.633 --> 07:19.507
And it looks like fate
wants me to squash
that frog boy.

07:20.340 --> 07:21.408
Haha!

07:21.441 --> 07:23.176
Frog-Man! Frog-Man!

07:23.210 --> 07:26.747
Yes, yes. Adore me!

07:26.780 --> 07:29.316
Please, please.
No thanks necessary!

07:29.349 --> 07:32.520
Okay,
maybe a few thanks necessary.

07:32.553 --> 07:36.023
Please, Frog-Man,
have a novelty pizza
on the house!

07:36.056 --> 07:37.991
Ooh, thanks!

07:38.025 --> 07:39.827
Halt, fiend!

07:39.860 --> 07:43.163
Scoundrels like you
deserve no such za!

07:43.196 --> 07:44.765
Who or what is that?

07:44.798 --> 07:46.466
Huh. It looks like Robert Otto.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.603
He said he hated me
and was gonna get his revenge.

07:49.637 --> 07:51.605
What's he doing here?

07:51.639 --> 07:55.142
Now frog, let's settle this!

07:57.745 --> 08:00.781
- Yes! My very own supervillain!

08:00.814 --> 08:04.685
People are going to
love me even more!
Just like Tarantu-Lad!

08:04.718 --> 08:07.521
This is no longer
a popularity contest.

08:07.555 --> 08:10.524
This is a battle
for the soul
of a city.

08:10.558 --> 08:12.225
A battle I intend to win!

08:12.926 --> 08:13.894
Whoa!

08:13.927 --> 08:16.396
Wow. Cool robot arm.

08:16.429 --> 08:17.698
Where'd you get it?

08:19.199 --> 08:21.101
Wouldn't you like to know!

08:23.003 --> 08:26.373
Frog-Man, you're but a wart
on the face of this city.

08:26.406 --> 08:28.909
Get ready
for some laser surgery!

08:58.438 --> 09:00.040
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

09:11.484 --> 09:13.754
Na, na,
you can't get me!

09:13.787 --> 09:16.156
Why won't you just sit still?

09:19.092 --> 09:21.929
Crime doesn't sit still
and neither shall I.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.263
Whoa!

09:28.068 --> 09:30.604
Huh? Molly Jo!
Huh? Granddaughter!

09:35.142 --> 09:37.210
Oh, good one, Frog-Man.

09:37.244 --> 09:41.081
Thanks. It was no problem
for Frog-Man, Defender of Jus--

09:41.114 --> 09:42.950
Jerk!

09:42.983 --> 09:45.986
No, justice.
Defender of Justice.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.921
Justice? Look around you!

09:47.955 --> 09:51.591
Your flashy battle
could have really hurt someone.
Or worse.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.663
What have I done?

09:55.696 --> 09:58.165
That's a lot of property damage.

09:58.198 --> 10:01.101
I don't believe this.
I thought you were cool.

10:01.134 --> 10:05.338
You're both just destructive
attention seekers. Nothing more.

10:05.372 --> 10:06.373
Wait!

10:08.141 --> 10:11.244
You're-- You're right.
It was selfish of me.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.581
If I really wanted
to help people,
there were better ways.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.750
You're darn right.

10:16.784 --> 10:21.188
Yeah, I'm sorry too.
We'll clean this up stat.
Mmm.

10:35.703 --> 10:36.804
Friends?

10:36.837 --> 10:38.405
Friends.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.175
Oh!

10:44.344 --> 10:46.513
Hey. Can I see your face?

10:46.546 --> 10:51.819
No.
It would give you nightmares.
And those nightmares would puke.

10:54.021 --> 10:56.123
Haha!

10:56.156 --> 10:58.391
You're definitely under arrest.

10:58.425 --> 10:59.526
Fair enough.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.800
I cannot believe this!

11:06.834 --> 11:09.369
You put all of us at risk
just to play dress up?

11:09.402 --> 11:12.005
Yep, but that's all done now.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.842
It ended up doing more harm
than good anyway.

11:15.943 --> 11:18.045
Looks like you've had a time.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.180
I have to admit,
it was a pretty cool costume.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.716
You like it?
I cut up your clothes
to make it.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.752
Sprig!
