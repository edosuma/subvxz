00:05.175 --> 00:06.723
Previously on ER...

00:06.724 --> 00:09.020
What time are you off?

00:09.155 --> 00:10.120
Now.

00:10.121 --> 00:14.200
You should all offer Dr. Corday
your congratulations since most of you...

00:14.235 --> 00:17.408
will be working with her in her new position
as associate chief of surgery.

00:17.409 --> 00:18.609
What's all this about, Robert?

00:18.716 --> 00:21.307
No "Thank you I'm honored"?
No "I hope I don't dissapoint"?

00:21.308 --> 00:22.508
You still want to marry me?

00:22.809 --> 00:24.505
- Yes.
- Ok.

00:24.906 --> 00:26.747
So, she's looking at surgery?

00:26.748 --> 00:28.451
Has to have a mastectomy, I'm affraid.

00:28.786 --> 00:30.014
What about Reece, eh?

00:30.315 --> 00:32.851
You ever think of that? I mean
you want to take him away from his father?

00:32.852 --> 00:34.475
You may not even be his father.

00:34.776 --> 00:36.066
What?

00:36.186 --> 00:39.103

00:53.967 --> 00:56.174
Hi. I'm here to see Dr. Weaver.

00:56.387 --> 00:59.804
- She went that way handing out badges.
- Excuse me?

01:02.102 --> 01:06.647
"Creativity, accountability,
respect, excellence."

01:06.817 --> 01:09.439
That's a lot to live up to.

01:09.654 --> 01:12.027
- He's looking for Dr. Weaver.
- This way.

01:12.199 --> 01:15.818
- Help me. I'm dying here...
- You'll be all right. Let's go. Sit here.

01:16.037 --> 01:19.441
- Lucy this guy has a little cut on his arm.
- A cut?! The bitch stabbed me!

01:19.458 --> 01:20.665
What'd she stab you with, sir?

01:20.690 --> 01:24.046
- Carving knife. Like I'm a
damn steak or something!

01:25.257 --> 01:26.669
There goes the ulnar!

01:26.784 --> 01:27.913
You're killing me!

01:28.012 --> 01:31.798
Just breathe. I'm sorry.
Sit down, please.

01:31.916 --> 01:34.804
Hold still. Don't be such a baby.

01:35.020 --> 01:36.009
We can't help you unless you stop.

01:36.061 --> 01:39.606
Look me in the eye. Hold still.

01:39.718 --> 01:42.470
- Are you a doctor?
- Keep the pressure on.

01:43.698 --> 01:45.276
We'll use this to make a tourniquet.

01:45.659 --> 01:49.823
Get his arm out. Put your arm out.
Come on around this side.

01:50.498 --> 01:54.164
- Pump it up to 180.
- Keep breathing. Relax.

01:54.587 --> 01:58.538
- We got 180.
- All right, take your hand off.

02:00.720 --> 02:03.508
Creativity. That's what's on your badge.

02:03.682 --> 02:04.713
Who are you?

02:04.892 --> 02:07.384
Sorry I'm late. You all right?

02:07.562 --> 02:12.356
Get me some curved Kellys
and Vicryl, I'll be even better.

02:12.568 --> 02:13.897
Good to see you.

02:14.070 --> 02:18.235
Lucy, this is Dr. Gabriel Lawrence,
our new Attending.

02:18.251 --> 02:19.896
How do you do?

03:12.521 --> 03:14.728
- Mark.
- I know, I'm late.

03:14.899 --> 03:18.814
Meet Gabe Lawrence.
This is Dr. Mark Greene.

03:19.029 --> 03:21.817
Dr. Lawrence, it's a pleasure to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

03:21.991 --> 03:23.395
Don't hold it against me.

03:23.430 --> 03:27.623
- Were you in an accident?
- No, I started my shift a little early.

03:27.832 --> 03:30.688
- I'm sorry?
- Gabe's from New Western...

03:30.723 --> 03:33.955
- ... as our new Attending.
- As our new Attending.

03:35.175 --> 03:38.545
- We're incredibly lucky to have him.
- Absolutely.

03:38.763 --> 03:41.052
We're gonna take the grand tour.
Would you like to come with us?

03:41.266 --> 03:43.758
I've done the tour. I'm gonna get this.

03:43.978 --> 03:46.185
- What do you got, Doris?
- A 28-year-old fell off his bike.

03:46.398 --> 03:48.106
I didn't fall. A cab cut me off.

03:48.317 --> 03:49.362
Passed out for two minutes.

03:49.435 --> 03:52.108
Small contusions to his Forehead.
Vitals are stable.

03:52.322 --> 03:54.778
- Reece might not be yours?
- That's what she said.

03:54.992 --> 03:56.511
- You think she lying?
- I don't know.

03:56.524 --> 03:59.154
I wasn't with her 24 hours a day.

03:59.331 --> 04:01.538
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.

04:01.751 --> 04:04.872
- She's gonna use this against me, isn't she?
- She can't.

04:04.989 --> 04:08.171
If Carla had any doubts she should've
raised them at the petition...

04:08.206 --> 04:09.835
to determine parentage three months ago.

04:09.853 --> 04:11.881
She didn't, so it's moot.
It's not a problem.

04:13.558 --> 04:16.394
You've put yourself through
a hell of a lot for this.

04:16.603 --> 04:18.072
Maybe we should make sure he's yours?

04:18.132 --> 04:20.517
- Do a DNA test.
- No.

04:20.858 --> 04:24.774
Peter, you hired me to protect
your interests.

04:25.865 --> 04:28.867
If you want a way out,
she gave you one.

04:38.548 --> 04:40.589
We'll have to intubate.

04:40.801 --> 04:44.467
Okay, on my count.
One, two, three. Good.

04:44.806 --> 04:47.429
- What do we got?
-16-year-old male.

04:47.643 --> 04:51.096
Single GSW to the left chest.
I'm gonna put him in a chest tube.

04:51.315 --> 04:52.644
Can you intubate?

04:52.859 --> 04:53.890
I think I can manage.

04:54.068 --> 04:56.311
15 of Etomidate, 100 of sux,
number-eight ET tube.

04:56.530 --> 04:59.567
- Help.
- You're gonna be okay. What's his name?

04:59.784 --> 05:02.276
Joshua Fox. That's his only I.D. he had.

05:02.496 --> 05:06.625
They'll put a tube down your throat
to help you breathe.

05:06.835 --> 05:09.409
- Can you call his family?
- Off a video card?

05:09.588 --> 05:12.045
It's all we've got. Thora-Seal's ready.

05:12.217 --> 05:13.248
Hook me up.

05:13.427 --> 05:16.097
What's this about a rescheduled surgery
this afternoon?

05:16.305 --> 05:18.595
Got a cancellation,
so I moved up a mastectomy.

05:18.809 --> 05:21.479
Oh, well, you can hold it back down.
I've got an elective hernia.

05:21.687 --> 05:24.218
I'm sorry. I'm not going to torture
a woman for another two weeks...

05:24.253 --> 05:26.331
just so some man can have his groin patched.

05:26.344 --> 05:27.642
Once again, male surgeons decide-

05:27.862 --> 05:31.314
Ok, I surrender. Hormones talking.
You can have your surgery.

05:31.633 --> 05:33.111
I'm in. Bag him.

05:33.327 --> 05:37.196
Well, It doesn't seem to be much blood in
here at all. I'll sew the tube in. An O silk.

05:37.416 --> 05:39.824
Good breath. Call ICU.

05:40.044 --> 05:42.619
- See if we can get him a bed?
- Sure. Be right back.

05:42.840 --> 05:47.135
So, Dr. Cordey, the mastectomy coming in
today, is it Elaine Nichols?

05:47.304 --> 05:50.389
- I thought that wasn't until-
- I moved it forward.

05:50.600 --> 05:54.551
Sure that's the right thing to do?
Isn't it kind of fast?

05:54.772 --> 05:57.857
- Why are you so interested?
- She's a friend of the family.

05:58.068 --> 06:01.153
Really? Then I shouldn't be
discussing it with you, should I?

06:01.364 --> 06:03.487
Make sure you get a chest film.

06:04.701 --> 06:07.769
Lucy, you finished assisting Dr. Carter.
Good. I have something for you.

06:07.781 --> 06:10.041
The Chicago Gazette is sending over
a reporter today.

06:10.116 --> 06:11.660
Mostly to do a puff piece on me.

06:11.877 --> 06:13.538
But they also want to take a look at the ER.

06:13.713 --> 06:14.944
Why are you telling me?

06:14.964 --> 06:17.717
Well, because you're going to show them
around let him see what heroes we all are.

06:17.885 --> 06:21.302
How we save kiddies' lives. Etcetera.
Blow my trumpet.

06:21.515 --> 06:24.053
- You do that better yourself.
- Look at you. Look at me.

06:24.068 --> 06:27.519
- Who'd you rather spend and hour with?
- You have a point.

06:27.940 --> 06:31.226
- Next time wear a helmet.
- Come on, doc, Give me a break.

06:31.444 --> 06:34.814
How about a fractured skull?
Want to be fed through a tube? Be my guest.

06:35.032 --> 06:37.987
Okay, I'll wear the helmet.
Can I go now?

06:38.203 --> 06:40.777
Not yet. We need a head CT.

06:42.709 --> 06:43.972
What's that?

06:44.044 --> 06:45.871
My Core Values badge.

06:46.046 --> 06:49.001
Creativity, Accountability,
Respect, Excellence.

06:49.217 --> 06:52.717
All that and beautiful too.
You must be some kind of nurse.

06:52.888 --> 06:54.383
I am.

06:55.058 --> 06:59.104
- Why doesn't Dr. Grumpy have one?
- Guess I'm out of the loop.

06:59.313 --> 07:03.002
It looks like you've got a broken arm,
Loren. We're gonna need some x-rays.

07:03.037 --> 07:04.568
Any other sign of trauma?

07:04.779 --> 07:09.738
Contusion to the right shoulder,
ecchymosis of the face and right hip...

07:10.244 --> 07:13.080
And slight wrist tenderness to the wrist.

07:13.874 --> 07:17.410
- How far did you fall, Loren?
- I'm not sure.

07:17.629 --> 07:19.171
Can you tell me how you fell?

07:19.381 --> 07:23.000
Did you fall like this,
or did you fall more on your hand?

07:23.661 --> 07:24.972
Yes.

07:25.263 --> 07:29.559
- What, on your hand?
- I don't remember. I'm sorry.

07:29.769 --> 07:32.641
Don't worry. Don't worry.
That's what we have x-rays for.

07:33.274 --> 07:35.800
So I'll get an AP,
and a lateral of the forearm,

07:35.977 --> 07:37.485
as well as wrist and elbow films.

07:37.696 --> 07:40.615
Sure, we don't want to miss anything.

07:41.868 --> 07:44.870
It's busy. I know, Patient through-time...

07:45.039 --> 07:47.836
is longer than at New Western.
But our census is bigger.

07:47.871 --> 07:50.204
OH, busy is good. Busy keeps you young.

07:50.463 --> 07:52.486
I'll just take a look
at that fellow in Three.

07:52.499 --> 07:55.670
Look at that. How cute is that.
Thanks, guys.

07:55.886 --> 07:59.755
- What's in here, it's so heavy?
- Something to spice up your wedding night.

07:59.975 --> 08:02.431
Conni! You shouldn't have.
Spice up mi wedding night?

08:03.464 --> 08:05.647
Sure! Nice hot gumbo
to keep up his strength.

08:05.816 --> 08:07.608
Jenny, It's this your last shift for a while?

08:07.777 --> 08:10.103
Yep, catching a plane at 6:00 to New Orleans.

08:10.322 --> 08:12.362
Then in the morning, Reggie will make me
an honest woman...

08:12.533 --> 08:13.612
and I'm going to show him the town.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.736
Show him a wild time in New Orleans, honey!

08:15.996 --> 08:18.914
I'm sure he'll be very happy.
Didn't I give you a Core Values badge?

08:19.125 --> 08:22.542
- A toddler chewed it.
- There you go. Always wear it.

08:22.754 --> 08:23.554
I will.

08:23.571 --> 08:26.587
I guess you can take it off
on your wedding night.

08:27.944 --> 08:29.555
Now, open your eyes.

08:29.930 --> 08:33.465
Relax. What three things
did I ask you to remember?

08:33.518 --> 08:37.386
- Dog, fire truck and Brigitte Bardot.
- Excellent.

08:37.607 --> 08:40.644
Dates me, I know, but your first love
is always your strongest.

08:40.660 --> 08:44.563
You must be Dr. Lawrence?
John Carter, Senior Resident.

08:44.783 --> 08:47.701
As usual, I'm learning how
to be a doctor from my patient.

08:47.870 --> 08:50.872
Meet Mr. Ulman. Minor head trauma,
brief LOC.

08:51.083 --> 08:55.627
You tell me what reflex would indicate
increased intracranial pressure.

08:57.049 --> 09:00.715
- A blown pupil?
- Not a reflex. Observe.

09:00.929 --> 09:02.672
I scratch the thenar eminence.

09:02.889 --> 09:06.722
I look for ipsilateral contractions
of the muscles of the chin muscles.

09:06.895 --> 09:08.126
I see none.

09:08.146 --> 09:11.214
Therefore I diagnose no significant
head injury.

09:11.284 --> 09:12.943
It's called Radovici's sign.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.442
You can dress, my friend.
I'll see about getting you discharged.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.483
- Thanks a lot, Doc!
- My pleasure.

09:19.411 --> 09:21.404
Radovici's sign? Pretty cool.

09:21.664 --> 09:23.953
- Try it on your next head trauma.
- I will.

09:24.125 --> 09:25.703
- Got that migraine in Four?
- Yeah, sure.

09:25.919 --> 09:29.752
I'll tell you how I remember.
Radovici sounds like radish.

09:29.787 --> 09:31.425
I pluck the radish with my thumb...

09:33.429 --> 09:36.300
Daycare said he cried all day,
tugging on his ear.

09:36.474 --> 09:37.506
Temp's 101.

09:37.726 --> 09:41.226
Must be a load off having a daycare
center here.

09:41.397 --> 09:44.269
- Does his mom work too?
- Yeah.

09:44.652 --> 09:49.114
It must be tough on the both of you.
Such a sweet kid.

09:51.202 --> 09:54.572
- How's his ear?
- He's got a nasty looking otitis.

09:54.748 --> 09:56.326
- Is he allergic to any medication?
- No.

09:58.211 --> 10:03.123
Ok. Some Tylenol for the pain, and
let's put him on amoxicillin for 10 days.

10:03.209 --> 10:05.218
Did you have ear infections as a kid?

10:05.387 --> 10:06.718
No, why?

10:06.972 --> 10:08.716
Is just they often run in families.

10:09.934 --> 10:12.780
Yeah, well, you know,
he probably got it in daycare.

10:12.815 --> 10:14.644
I mean, there is a Lot of sick kids up there.

10:14.857 --> 10:18.477
You wanna leave him here with me
until his temperature goes down?

10:21.115 --> 10:22.396
Yeah, sure.

10:26.164 --> 10:28.916
I know. Come on, come on.

10:29.376 --> 10:31.932
All right. There you go.

10:40.616 --> 10:44.184
Has ICU found a bed
for Joshua Fox yet?

10:44.354 --> 10:48.139
The gunshot wound kid in Trauma One.
Well, call them again.

10:48.159 --> 10:51.396
- Have you seen my bicycle guy?
- Isn't he still in courtain Three?

10:51.513 --> 10:54.953
Spandex-butt?
Yeah, he was discharged by GL.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.113
- Who's GL?
- Gabriel Lawrence.

10:57.329 --> 10:59.203
All right, the good-looking older guy.

10:59.373 --> 11:02.957
I just saw him going
to the lounge with Dr. Corday.

11:03.170 --> 11:06.001
A Frenchman, Dr. René Laënnec...

11:06.036 --> 11:10.341
rather than press his ear
to mademoiselle's magnificent breast...

11:10.512 --> 11:15.342
rolled-up a newspaper instead
and used that to listen to her heart.

11:15.561 --> 11:17.352
Voilà, the first stethoscope!

11:17.363 --> 11:21.016
Voilà, the first sensitive male doctor
in history!

11:21.235 --> 11:23.806
Dr. Green, you know
who invented the stethoscope?

11:24.089 --> 11:28.070
I don't.
Did you discharge my patient?

11:28.244 --> 11:29.475
I don't believe so.

11:29.495 --> 11:31.951
Mr. Ulman. Fell off his bike.

11:32.583 --> 11:34.991
I wasn't aware he's your patient.

11:35.211 --> 11:38.628
He was. I'd ordered a head CT
which he obviously didn't get.

11:39.091 --> 11:43.256
Don't worry. I performed a thorough
neurological exam. He didn't need a CT.

11:43.472 --> 11:44.847
The lost of consciousness...

11:45.015 --> 11:47.554
put him a risk factor
of intracranial hemorrhage.

11:48.144 --> 11:51.614
Minuscule risk. I gave him
a head-injury instructions sheet.

11:51.649 --> 11:53.396
If he has any warning signs, he'll come back.

11:53.610 --> 11:56.814
He lives alone. If he slips into a coma,
no one knows.

11:57.031 --> 11:58.190
This isn't like New Western.

11:58.200 --> 12:02.449
County patients tend to be a little
less reliable when it comes to follow-up.

12:02.621 --> 12:03.653
I'm aware of that, Dr. Green.

12:03.831 --> 12:07.332
That's why I told him to call me
in four hours to tell me how he's doing.

12:07.544 --> 12:10.582
Difficult if he's passed out
on the floor.

12:14.637 --> 12:16.179
What would you do?

12:17.223 --> 12:20.428
Without seeing the patient,
I'd rather-

12:20.645 --> 12:24.014
No, I'd like to know.
What would you do?

12:24.232 --> 12:27.484
Fell off his bike. Lost consciousness.

12:30.449 --> 12:32.241
You did a complete neuro exam?

12:32.451 --> 12:37.364
Yes, he was alert and oriented.
Full balance, recall, normal reflexes.

12:37.959 --> 12:40.248
- How long was lost of consciousness?
- Less than two minutes.

12:40.712 --> 12:44.378
- You visualized the fundi?
- Discs were sharp.

12:45.510 --> 12:48.595
I think Dr. Greene
was just being very thorough.

12:48.973 --> 12:50.930
Sounds like a "no" to me.

12:51.142 --> 12:54.429
Look at it this way.
We just saved Mr. Ulman $800.

12:55.147 --> 12:58.648
- "A" for Accountability.
- Right.

13:00.112 --> 13:02.303
Yeah but she really
does meet all the requirements.

13:02.338 --> 13:03.862
I really couldn't agree
with you more on this-

13:04.034 --> 13:06.739
- Can I talk to you?
- You'll get back to me later, right?

13:06.954 --> 13:09.197
- As soon as I can.
- What's up?

13:09.416 --> 13:11.704
What's up? Why you didn't tell me
you were hiring Lawrence?

13:11.778 --> 13:13.873
I only found out that he was available
two days ago.

13:14.047 --> 13:16.884
So, in two days you didn't have time
for a five-minute conversation?

13:16.902 --> 13:19.556
Mark, look, I mean, the man's a legend.

13:19.591 --> 13:22.033
He's one of the founding fathers
of emergency medicine.

13:22.107 --> 13:24.099
We're so lucky to have him.

13:24.310 --> 13:27.346
Couldn't you have the courtesy
to at least tell me first?

13:27.523 --> 13:29.048
It's called respect, Kerry.

13:29.083 --> 13:32.057
Look, it's even on your stupid badge.

13:43.418 --> 13:45.126
Elaine.

13:46.589 --> 13:50.041
- Heard you were coming in today.
- Did you?

13:51.120 --> 13:54.562
- I asked you to leave me alone.
- Yeah, I know.

13:54.722 --> 13:58.807
I know that you did and I'm sorry.
But I really need to talk to you.

13:59.021 --> 14:00.849
Because it's...

14:01.316 --> 14:04.484
Because I don't want you to have
the wrong idea about me.

14:04.695 --> 14:05.941
I don't.

14:06.364 --> 14:09.559
I want you to know that I'm here for you.
And that for me this wasn't just about-

14:09.594 --> 14:10.816
- Sex?
- Yeah.

14:10.995 --> 14:13.665
- It wasn't about that.
- It was for me.

14:14.959 --> 14:20.000
If we're talking needs, John, I don't need
you to feel sorry or worried.

14:20.049 --> 14:23.750
Or tender or anything.
I just need you to go away.

14:25.222 --> 14:26.681
I don't wanna go away.

14:33.941 --> 14:37.643
Loren Johnson's X-ray. Mid-shaft fracture
of the radius.

14:37.863 --> 14:41.316
No injury to the wrist or elbow.
She was lucky.

14:41.535 --> 14:44.987
- Maybe not.
- What's this?

14:45.206 --> 14:49.052
Some more of Loren Johnson.
I pulled her records.

14:49.162 --> 14:52.132
See these calluses?
Healed rib fractures.

14:52.298 --> 14:56.677
And this, some kind of blunt trauma.

14:57.180 --> 14:59.303
Maybe a baseball bat.

14:59.516 --> 15:02.304
She wants to go home as soon
as we splint her arm.

15:02.420 --> 15:04.476
You know, this is only her second visit here.

15:04.490 --> 15:10.103
But she has been to Mercy three times,
McGaw twice, Ravenswood once.

15:10.222 --> 15:12.860
This time, I don't want her
to go home.

15:16.338 --> 15:18.555
- Dr. Kovac?
- Yes?

15:18.590 --> 15:21.365
Yes. Hi, I'm Loren's husband, Pauly.

15:21.400 --> 15:23.753
I just want to thank you
for looking after her so well.

15:25.199 --> 15:28.919
Loren wasn't clear on how
the accident exactly happened.

15:29.038 --> 15:33.884
Maybe that's because she's a little bit
embarrassed about it, isn't that right, Loren?

15:34.403 --> 15:35.818
How did it happen?

15:36.338 --> 15:40.566
She was up a ladder in our bedroom
hanging drapes and lost her footing.

15:40.778 --> 15:43.945
Asked her not to do it by herself,
didn't I, honey?

15:44.157 --> 15:45.586
Yes, you did.

15:50.332 --> 15:52.341
Shall I splint her?

15:54.671 --> 15:57.722
- Mark, can I have a word-?
- Lizzy, Paula Trancoso, Chicago Gazette.

15:57.792 --> 16:00.548
Elizabeth Corday,
My associate Head of Surgery.

16:00.720 --> 16:03.242
And Mark Greene, one or our ER docs.

16:03.357 --> 16:04.620
You' re wearing scrubs.

16:04.692 --> 16:07.265
Yes, it was my idea. I wanted to blend in.

16:08.105 --> 16:10.743
Elizabeth was gonna show Paula
around the ER. You don't mind, Mark?

16:11.242 --> 16:14.397
If you feel Dr. Corday has the time...

16:14.513 --> 16:16.718
Had I known that the Gazette
was gonna send you, my dear,

16:16.753 --> 16:18.344
I would have made time in my schedule.

16:18.614 --> 16:22.619
But as it is, I'll have to leave you to
the tender mercies of Dr. Corday.

16:22.999 --> 16:27.045
Well, this is the ER, obviously.

16:30.042 --> 16:33.197
- This is Josh's cousin.
- Great.

16:33.312 --> 16:37.188
Josh. Josh, your cousin's here.

16:38.219 --> 16:39.534
How's he doing?

16:39.587 --> 16:40.846
He looks a lot worse than he is.

16:40.956 --> 16:43.076
His lung collapsed so we put a tube
in his chest.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.772
You can talk to him if you want.

16:44.986 --> 16:48.356
- He's taching at 140.
- Josh, are you in pain?

16:48.474 --> 16:50.982
- BP 180 over 120.
- Call Benton.

16:51.002 --> 16:55.331
- Maybe he's hemorrhaging. Let's spin the crit.
- His pulse is up to 160.

16:55.366 --> 16:58.583
You'll have to wait outside.
Wait outside, please.

16:58.732 --> 17:01.669
Go outside. Come on.

17:01.882 --> 17:04.718
What is it?
Does the chest tube hurt you?

17:04.828 --> 17:08.179
- What have we got?
- He's tachy at 160.

17:09.166 --> 17:11.806
- What's his crit?
- Drawing it.

17:12.570 --> 17:14.480
You having trouble breathing?

17:17.528 --> 17:19.853
You were shot. Yes, we know.

17:26.164 --> 17:28.371
My God! He's the shooter.

17:30.252 --> 17:32.044
I'll call Security.

17:44.604 --> 17:48.389
- Hey, hold it right there!
- He's got a gun!

17:50.695 --> 17:52.071
Drop it!

17:57.454 --> 17:58.997
Get down!

18:35.587 --> 18:39.022
- We need a gurney over here.
- Looks like an abdominal wound.

18:39.100 --> 18:41.970
- Get a backboard, over here!
- Strong carotid pulse.

18:42.137 --> 18:45.637
- His chest's clear. His name?
- McGinnis. Joe McGinnis.

18:45.808 --> 18:47.766
- Need help?
- We're fine.

18:47.978 --> 18:49.885
I want two lines NG and a Foley.

18:49.956 --> 18:52.894
Roll him gently. Gently.

18:53.818 --> 18:56.773
On my count. One, two, three, lift.

18:56.989 --> 18:59.725
CBC, coag, type and cross for four.
Call O.R.

18:59.835 --> 19:01.729
BP's 130 over 80. Pulse is 96.

19:02.304 --> 19:04.242
No visible GSWs to chest or abdomen.

19:04.257 --> 19:05.916
Let's roll him.

19:06.627 --> 19:08.187
See anything back there?
Any blood?

19:08.204 --> 19:10.996
- Nothing on the back.
- All right, check the extremities.

19:11.016 --> 19:14.171
- Where's the blood from?
- Looks like he cut his hand.

19:14.206 --> 19:17.762
- Did he even get shot?
- No, he fainted.

19:21.696 --> 19:23.854
- Is this the guy who got shot? You need me?
- Yes, his hand needs suturing.

19:24.917 --> 19:27.456
Suturing? That's it?

19:27.471 --> 19:30.163
I want every piece of equipment
checked for damage.

19:30.183 --> 19:33.571
I don't want anybody seizing
because their IVs are punctured.

19:33.587 --> 19:36.315
- Nineteen patients all accounted for.
- Nobody's hurt?

19:36.340 --> 19:40.184
Nothing serious, apart from the guard.
Two flesh wounds from ricochets.

19:40.219 --> 19:43.485
Some glass cuts and contusions
from diving to the floor. That's all.

19:43.500 --> 19:47.715
That's all? There must've been
about 20 bullets flying around.

19:47.772 --> 19:49.716
Guess we got lucky.

19:51.860 --> 19:54.852
MVA, SUV versus truck.
38-year-old male driver...

19:54.930 --> 19:56.488
broke his nose when the airbag inflated.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.257
- My wife and child were-
- They are just behind you.

19:58.292 --> 20:00.127
Wife has a few minor scrapes,
little boy is Ok.

20:00.162 --> 20:01.726
Why the cops? What's going on here?

20:01.761 --> 20:03.149
Curtain Three!

20:03.984 --> 20:05.793
- What do we got?
- Boy's named David. He's nine.

20:05.813 --> 20:09.933
Slightly tachy 110. BP's 115 over 83.
Chest pain.

20:09.950 --> 20:12.040
One, two, three!

20:13.789 --> 20:17.406
Hi, David, I'm Cleo.
Do you know what happened to you?

20:17.418 --> 20:20.257
We were in an accident.
This truck just hit us.

20:20.372 --> 20:22.375
Son of a bitch came right through the red.

20:22.879 --> 20:25.384
Look, I know my nose is broken.
Why are you fiddling with my face for?

20:25.403 --> 20:28.275
Just checking to see if anything else
is broken, Mr. Bradley.

20:28.291 --> 20:30.933
If David's okay,
we don't have to stay do we?

20:31.111 --> 20:34.327
Lungs clear bilaterally.
Still tachycardic.

20:34.340 --> 20:37.393
We called our doctor from the ambulance.
He said they should take us to Ambrose.

20:37.461 --> 20:39.654
But the paramedics said you were closest.

20:39.672 --> 20:43.622
They are allowed to do that, the paramedics.
Can they go against the patients' wishes?

20:43.794 --> 20:46.998
Get a crit, UA, C-spine
and chest film.

20:47.115 --> 20:51.344
Until I do these tests,
David's not going anywhere.

20:53.006 --> 20:54.884
Elaine?

20:55.359 --> 20:58.763
- Is everything all right?
- Everything is fine.

20:58.780 --> 21:01.701
I just think maybe this has been
too fast for me.

21:01.718 --> 21:05.236
So, I wanna go home and think about it.

21:05.597 --> 21:09.826
You know, I could use some fresh air myself.
Why don't we take a walk?

21:11.738 --> 21:14.993
- Want to say goodbye to anybody else?
- I've been doing that all day.

21:15.009 --> 21:17.617
You didn't think you were
to sneak out on us, did you girl?

21:17.638 --> 21:20.135
Beautiful. How will I get it on the plane?

21:20.170 --> 21:22.632
Leave Reggie behind
and put them on his seat.

21:22.919 --> 21:24.198
- Thank you.
- Take care.

21:24.213 --> 21:26.473
- See you.
- Thanks.

21:26.566 --> 21:29.070
Jeany I need to see you in here
and you too, Reggie.

21:29.071 --> 21:30.400
- But my shift is over
- I know.

21:30.435 --> 21:32.939
- We have a plane to catch.
- I know. Come on.

21:37.530 --> 21:38.810
Carlos!

21:39.483 --> 21:40.728
What's going on?

21:40.743 --> 21:44.328
Ask Adele. She really put herself
on the line for this.

21:44.339 --> 21:46.865
We're gonna let you take Carlos.

21:48.752 --> 21:50.128
Really?

21:50.497 --> 21:54.726
On a temporary basis. And once you get
yourself approved as a foster parent...

21:54.736 --> 21:59.217
...then we can consider something
more official and permanent.

21:59.725 --> 22:00.970
Thank you.

22:00.985 --> 22:02.217
You're welcome.

22:02.937 --> 22:05.643
I guess we're not going to New Orleans.

22:05.816 --> 22:07.940
We can still get married here in Chicago.

22:09.705 --> 22:12.396
We could try the courthouse.

22:12.625 --> 22:14.403
When?

22:15.279 --> 22:17.157
Today.

22:20.469 --> 22:23.620
- Dr. Lawrence.
- Dr. Greene. I've got her.

22:23.690 --> 22:27.442
Next time, could you sign up
on the board?

22:31.483 --> 22:34.501
Paperwork! You can run,
but you can't hide.

22:34.512 --> 22:39.226
- She's really hurting this time.
- You been sick with fever, Cristal?

22:39.577 --> 22:41.152
Vomiting a little?

22:41.704 --> 22:43.532
No. Just hurting.

22:43.632 --> 22:45.505
She's had a sickle crisis before?

22:45.577 --> 22:47.606
The same as last month.

22:48.446 --> 22:52.995
We're gonna get you something for the pain,
and then we're gonna run some tests.

22:53.303 --> 22:55.160
80 of Demerol, 40 of Phenergan,

22:55.230 --> 22:58.466
CBC, chem panel and a UA, please.

23:00.353 --> 23:03.674
- Is that the sickle-cell girl?
- Yeah.

23:03.691 --> 23:06.762
Could you add a retic count
and a Beta HCG?

23:06.837 --> 23:08.479
You got it.

23:11.660 --> 23:14.661
Can we go now, doctor, before another
gang band start sooting out the place?

23:14.772 --> 23:17.380
- I need to talk to you first.
- Sure, what about?

23:17.459 --> 23:21.444
It's just some forms to fill out.
Please.

23:23.533 --> 23:25.328
Something wrong?

23:28.431 --> 23:32.333
I have to inform you Mr. Johnshon
that I believe you're mentally ill.

23:32.553 --> 23:33.498
What?!

23:33.571 --> 23:38.220
- Because of your illness you can reasonably-
- You're the one who's ill!

23:40.806 --> 23:43.063
What the hell do you think-?

23:44.193 --> 23:47.777
Okay, I get it.
I'm in the nuthouse, huh?

23:54.039 --> 23:56.743
"Due to your illness,
you can reasonably be expected...

23:56.860 --> 24:00.835
to inflict serious physical harm
on yourself or on others.

24:00.973 --> 24:03.289
Therefore you're subject
to involuntary admision...

24:03.369 --> 24:06.341
and are in need
of immediate hospitalization."

24:06.555 --> 24:09.723
Wait till my lawyer gets ahold of you.

24:15.108 --> 24:17.085
You have no criteria to hold him.

24:17.161 --> 24:18.292
Her x-rays are my criteria.

24:18.312 --> 24:21.051
If she won't press charges,
they mean nothing.

24:21.124 --> 24:24.361
He's gonna get up to Psych, and they'll
send him right back down and he'll go home.

24:24.378 --> 24:26.437
I don't care about him.
I care about her.

24:26.457 --> 24:30.492
We can do nothing or we can do something.
This way she has a chance.

24:35.634 --> 24:37.177
I can't really...

24:37.228 --> 24:38.888
run away.

24:39.231 --> 24:40.262
Can I?

24:40.341 --> 24:42.996
You can delay, but not for long.

24:44.004 --> 24:45.880
Elaine, if you are worried
about reconstruction,

24:46.100 --> 24:49.041
I can make an appointment
with a plastic surgeon, and you can just-

24:49.077 --> 24:53.110
What will happen to it?
After you cut it off?

24:53.324 --> 24:57.952
- Now you're being morbid.
- Why? It's a part of me.

24:58.673 --> 25:02.622
It'll go to Pathology
and then it'll be got rid of.

25:03.637 --> 25:05.747
Thrown in the trash.

25:06.892 --> 25:08.966
Just medical waste.

25:09.812 --> 25:12.551
I'll have a blob of gel instead.

25:14.585 --> 25:17.936
What will it feel like
when I touch it?

25:18.648 --> 25:20.191
When somebody else touches it?

25:20.359 --> 25:23.144
Elaine, lots of women
have this type of surgery.

25:23.155 --> 25:25.178
I can't imagine feeling anything.

25:25.591 --> 25:28.993
And If I can't, how will anybody else?

25:29.296 --> 25:32.034
How can I be with anybody again?

25:32.249 --> 25:36.463
- You can't let this define you.
- It's hard not to.

25:36.538 --> 25:39.247
I was happy with who I was.

25:39.392 --> 25:42.463
That's exactly who you'll still be.

25:47.919 --> 25:50.060
I'd better come back in.

25:51.607 --> 25:54.479
I may be vain, but I'm not stupid.

25:58.483 --> 26:01.669
- Can you do something for me?
- Of course.

26:01.838 --> 26:05.753
When you cut, you cut everything.

26:06.010 --> 26:08.946
Don't leave anything. Cut it all.

26:11.375 --> 26:14.530
You know the only good thing
about sickle cell gene?

26:14.646 --> 26:17.059
- There isn't anything good.
- No, no, there is.

26:17.094 --> 26:18.953
You know, there is a disease
called malaria...

26:19.073 --> 26:22.978
that kills almost a million children a year.

26:22.990 --> 26:26.026
What do you think
protects people against malaria?

26:26.461 --> 26:29.965
The sickle-cell gene.
That isn't a bad thing, is it?

26:30.082 --> 26:32.359
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

26:32.861 --> 26:36.198
She should drink lots of liquids and bring
her right back if she has more pain.

26:36.233 --> 26:39.253
- Sure. Say thank you, Cristal.
- Thank you.

26:39.269 --> 26:41.959
You're welcome. You can get dressed
and go home now.

26:45.494 --> 26:47.967
Over here. Over here.

26:48.490 --> 26:50.315
Thank you.

26:50.592 --> 26:53.301
- The labs come back yet?
- No, not yet.

26:53.336 --> 26:55.428
Let me know if they do.

26:55.807 --> 26:59.109
Dr. Kovac. Carl De Raad, Psychiatry.

26:59.278 --> 27:01.851
Your psychiatric hold:
way out of line, my friend.

27:02.023 --> 27:02.898
Why?

27:02.933 --> 27:06.801
Because to justify certification a patient
has to be a danger to himself or others.

27:06.821 --> 27:09.696
He is a danger to others.
Come on, just look at his wife.

27:09.875 --> 27:11.484
She said she fell off a ladder.

27:11.519 --> 27:15.206
Until she says different, nothing we can do.
I'm sorry.

27:15.224 --> 27:17.151
- Have you talked to him?
- I've seen him.

27:17.168 --> 27:21.873
Dr Kovac, I know why you did it. But I'm not
even gonna take him upstairs for evaluation.

27:21.908 --> 27:23.343
I'm going to release him.

27:23.359 --> 27:27.179
Can you do me a favor?
Can you talk to him at least?

27:27.239 --> 27:29.713
- What's the point?
- Please.

27:30.452 --> 27:33.689
You and me, let's talk to him.

27:35.083 --> 27:36.694
The crazy foreigner.

27:36.777 --> 27:38.516
They should put these on you, you know?

27:38.592 --> 27:41.277
Why? I'm not going to hit your wife.

27:41.316 --> 27:43.864
I never hurt my wife. Never.

27:43.899 --> 27:45.846
Mr. Johnson, settle down.
We just want to talk to you.

27:45.855 --> 27:48.848
Well talk to her. Go ahead, ask her.
Have I ever hurt you?

27:48.934 --> 27:51.573
No! Will you let him go, please?

27:51.646 --> 27:53.697
- You want us to release him?
- Please.

27:53.698 --> 27:54.698
OK. Let him go.

27:54.749 --> 27:58.597
How long before you hit her again?
On the way home?

27:58.813 --> 28:03.144
Or maybe wait till you get drunk?
Have a bad day at work?

28:03.161 --> 28:05.897
- What are you doing?
- One thing I don't understand.

28:05.906 --> 28:10.560
The X-rays show your wife had
three cracked ribs. Here:

28:11.070 --> 28:13.179
- How'd it happen?
- Leave it, Kovac.

28:13.199 --> 28:16.735
She fell off a ladder again? Or what?
Was it down the stairs, maybe-

28:16.812 --> 28:18.507
Can you shut this guy up?

28:18.622 --> 28:21.577
- Did you just kick her?
- That's enough.

28:21.651 --> 28:23.311
To break her ribs...

28:23.420 --> 28:27.471
you'd have to stamp on her chest.
What a man!

28:27.492 --> 28:29.138
Shut up!

28:33.433 --> 28:35.144
Go on, then.

28:37.371 --> 28:38.900
Screw you.

28:40.484 --> 28:42.113
- I'll kill him!
- No!

28:42.428 --> 28:43.703
I'll kill him!

28:43.913 --> 28:46.483
- Calm down, Mr. Johnson!
- Get off of me! I'm gonna kill him!

28:47.484 --> 28:51.764
- See? Danger to others.
- Get out of here!

28:52.591 --> 28:53.920
See?

28:57.764 --> 28:59.015
All right.

28:59.050 --> 29:02.335
Mark, Beta HCG on the sickler.

29:02.345 --> 29:05.133
- Where are they?
- They walked out a couple of minutes ago.

29:05.408 --> 29:07.893
Lawrence, we got a problem here.

29:12.884 --> 29:14.979
Mr. Powell?

29:17.507 --> 29:20.125
- We need you to come back into the hospital.
- But we just left.

29:20.160 --> 29:21.991
Your daughter needs another test.

29:22.004 --> 29:23.762
But we've seen the doctor.
Cristal is feeling much better.

29:23.832 --> 29:25.959
- What is it?
- She needs to come back.

29:26.076 --> 29:28.632
- Excuse me?
- The ICON is positive.

29:31.316 --> 29:33.972
She has to come right back in. Now.

29:40.687 --> 29:43.176
Dr. Finch, Sam Jacobs.

29:43.248 --> 29:47.114
I just want to thank you for looking after
one of my favorite families so very well.

29:47.128 --> 29:48.706
We haven't quite finished the tests.

29:48.722 --> 29:51.448
I've made arrangements for David
to be transfered to Ambrose.

29:51.467 --> 29:54.538
If you'd be so kind as to sign him.

29:55.873 --> 29:57.698
I'm not happy about moving him.

29:57.809 --> 30:01.079
I've looked it. His C-spine's clear.
An ambulance is waiting.

30:01.197 --> 30:04.515
He complained of back pain at the scene.
I'm still waiting on a second crit.

30:04.550 --> 30:06.885
When you get that, fax it over to me.

30:07.062 --> 30:08.722
It'll be a half an hour, that's all.

30:08.739 --> 30:11.363
In half an hour, Dr. Finch, he'll be
under observation at Ambrose,

30:11.398 --> 30:13.616
not taking up precious space here.

30:13.629 --> 30:15.724
We ready to roll, Sam?

30:16.499 --> 30:18.128
Are we, Dr. Finch?

30:19.620 --> 30:22.787
- There's the ovary.
- It looks pretty normal.

30:22.999 --> 30:27.047
- What are you looking for?
- There. Mass in the fallopian tube.

30:27.163 --> 30:29.933
- What is it?
- Fetal pole and heartbeat.

30:30.084 --> 30:33.002
- What did he say?
- There's a heartbeat.

30:33.213 --> 30:35.339
- What are you saying?
- There's a heartbeat.

30:35.458 --> 30:38.959
- Your daughter's pregnant.
- No, she's 12 years old!

30:39.070 --> 30:42.723
- There's got to be a mistake.
- There's no mistake. She's pregnant.

30:42.783 --> 30:46.365
The fetus is in the fallopian tube,
not the uterus.

30:46.980 --> 30:49.021
- I want a second opinion.
- I'm the second opinion.

30:49.033 --> 30:50.840
We're lucky we caught this early enough.

30:50.875 --> 30:52.901
Your daughter needs surgery now.

30:52.963 --> 30:57.328
If it ruptures, it could be very
dangerous. I'm gonna call the O.R.

31:00.456 --> 31:05.716
- Were you checking up on me?
- Just watching out for the patients.

31:10.060 --> 31:11.075
Will there be video games?

31:11.153 --> 31:14.270
Sure. Video games, TV, your own room.

31:14.441 --> 31:18.643
Just like a hotel.
What's your favorite game?

31:18.746 --> 31:20.324
David?

31:20.424 --> 31:24.243
David? David, can you hear me? Stop!

31:24.262 --> 31:26.087
What? Why are we stopping?

31:26.490 --> 31:28.849
- He's tacky. Get a BP.
- I can't get a pressure.

31:28.926 --> 31:31.252
No pulse on the left. Go to trauma.

31:31.371 --> 31:33.748
- I don't want him staying here.
- He has to.

31:33.766 --> 31:35.555
- Need a hand?
- Eight years old. Name is David,

31:35.633 --> 31:39.134
in rapid deceleration. MVA, crashed
while being transferred to Ambrose.

31:39.206 --> 31:42.642
Probable a traumatic rupture at the junction
of the subclavian and aortic arch.

31:42.761 --> 31:45.513
- Why was he being transfered?
- All right, we' re going to have to crack him.

31:45.581 --> 31:48.687
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Thoracotomy tray.

31:50.354 --> 31:52.381
Where is Kerry? She said she'd be here.

31:52.398 --> 31:54.988
- You know this place closes at 5?
- Yeah, we know.

31:55.001 --> 31:58.821
- Do we really need two?
- Two witnesses, yes.

32:06.075 --> 32:09.376
Right, suction. Start a round with
the packed cells.

32:09.487 --> 32:12.176
- He's in V-tach.
-60 of lidocaine.

32:12.190 --> 32:16.175
- Son of a bitch. I can't find the source.
- He's still in V-tach.

32:16.195 --> 32:19.415
Stand by with the paddles.
I've never done one like this before.

32:19.634 --> 32:24.029
- Why don't you talk me through it?
- Keep suctioning. You have to-

32:24.198 --> 32:26.461
Connie, would you get
that woman out of here!

32:26.996 --> 32:28.201
Ma'am, you have to leave.

32:28.236 --> 32:32.155
- Peter, need any help?
- Please, Mark, get that woman out of here.

32:32.374 --> 32:33.942
- Get your hands off me.
- Out!

32:33.977 --> 32:37.379
Gonna clamp distally to the left subclavian.

32:37.798 --> 32:41.250
Open the pleura to identify
the area that's leaking.

32:42.714 --> 32:45.492
Release the clamp distally
to identify the leak.

32:47.828 --> 32:50.350
- I see it.
- Now evacuate the hematoma.

32:50.899 --> 32:55.610
Put a curved Potts underneath the leak
to leave the aorta patent.

32:58.325 --> 33:00.534
Now clamp above the tear.

33:02.806 --> 33:05.746
There you go, Carter,
You just isolated the leak.

33:06.681 --> 33:08.353
Nice work, Carter.

33:12.093 --> 33:15.111
Do you Reginald Moore take this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife...

33:15.122 --> 33:17.511
to live together in the state
of matrimony...

33:17.683 --> 33:21.136
to love her, honor and keep her
through sickness and prosperity...

33:21.155 --> 33:23.413
whatever your future might be?

33:23.424 --> 33:25.319
I do.

33:26.211 --> 33:30.824
- I think he needs a feeding.
- Okay. Just one second.

33:33.270 --> 33:37.952
Sorry. Hi. Are you hungry?

33:38.126 --> 33:39.621
It's okay. Go on.

33:39.703 --> 33:43.306
And do you Jeanie Boulay take this man
as your lawful wedded husband...

33:43.439 --> 33:45.808
to live together
in the state of matrimony...

33:46.061 --> 33:49.224
to love, honor and keep him
through sickness and prosperity...

33:49.233 --> 33:50.975
whatever your future might be?

33:51.027 --> 33:52.896
I do!

33:57.952 --> 33:58.927
No, it's not unusual.

33:58.962 --> 34:01.653
This is a teaching hospital
and Residents are here to learn.

34:01.673 --> 34:04.016
So they are allowed to practice on patients.

34:04.093 --> 34:05.569
How else do they learn?

34:05.679 --> 34:07.919
A little tough on whoever
they learn on, isn't it?

34:08.090 --> 34:10.047
The residents are carefully supervised.

34:10.101 --> 34:12.748
What I saw wasn't
carefully supervised.

34:13.313 --> 34:15.358
Well, I'm sure you've seen enough,
didn't you?.

34:15.433 --> 34:20.841
It was really really nice to meet you. And
I do look forward to reading your article.

34:21.264 --> 34:23.983
Mark, thank God I got rid of her.

34:24.052 --> 34:28.214
Yeah, careful she doesn't turn up
somewhere else disguised as a surgeon.

34:28.425 --> 34:30.951
- Did she get in the way in Trauma?
- Yeah.

34:31.027 --> 34:35.475
- Mark, I didn't ask to be her tour guide.
- Well, you didn't say no.

34:38.495 --> 34:41.572
- How's it going?
- Fine. Heard about your Psych hold.

34:42.626 --> 34:44.784
Yeah, I'm very popular with Psychiatry.

34:44.804 --> 34:48.670
They took him upstairs for assessment.
Maybe they'll hold him.

34:48.684 --> 34:52.752
I don't think so. I provoked him,
in front of witnesses.

34:52.871 --> 34:55.043
Maybe now she'll see how he's really like,
you know.

34:55.109 --> 34:56.889
You don't think she knows?

34:57.061 --> 34:59.101
Yeah, I know, it's hopeless.

34:59.197 --> 35:01.260
Maybe not. She didn't go upstairs with him.

35:01.282 --> 35:03.186
Lucy took her to the cafeteria.

35:04.070 --> 35:05.731
Fingers crossed.

35:11.338 --> 35:13.946
David's stabilized. He's in surgery.

35:14.025 --> 35:16.451
Barring any complications, he'll be okay.

35:16.878 --> 35:18.456
If you want to go and see him
the nurse will take you.

35:18.723 --> 35:21.927
- Thank you.
- Thank you, doctor.

35:23.829 --> 35:25.507
Dr. Finch.

35:27.934 --> 35:29.559
You did well to catch that.

35:29.812 --> 35:32.435
If we'd waited for the tests,
we'd would have seen this.

35:32.582 --> 35:34.145
We could've operated
in a controlled manner...

35:34.317 --> 35:36.690
...rather than having to rip an
8- year-old's chest open.

35:36.929 --> 35:39.302
- We had no choice.
- I did.

35:39.416 --> 35:42.072
I shouldn't have let myself
listen to you.

35:55.136 --> 35:58.553
- How are you feeling?
- Okay.

35:59.308 --> 36:03.141
It went well. There was no evidence
the cancer had spread.

36:03.355 --> 36:07.057
But we will have to wait for the pathology
reports on the lymph nodes.

36:07.302 --> 36:11.103
I got a plastic surgeon in to close,
so we could minimize scarring.

36:11.324 --> 36:15.109
And of course within the next couple
of weeks we can begin reconstruction.

36:16.205 --> 36:17.865
When can I go home?

36:18.541 --> 36:22.326
Well, we had to put in some drains
to collect any accumulating fluid.

36:22.671 --> 36:24.795
Like I'm a sewer system.

36:25.266 --> 36:27.588
Most likely it'll just be for the night.

36:27.803 --> 36:30.211
So you'll be able
to go home tomorrow.

36:31.208 --> 36:34.144
Now, I've given the nurse
all my numbers.

36:34.312 --> 36:39.141
So if you need anything,
you have any questions, just call...

36:39.360 --> 36:40.688
anytime.

36:42.889 --> 36:44.449
Thanks.

36:46.035 --> 36:49.239
Oh, Dr. Kovak, now
that Dr. Lawrence is here...

36:49.456 --> 36:52.873
I don't believe that we're gonna be
needing you anymore, ok?.

36:53.086 --> 36:55.126
Okay.

36:55.297 --> 36:59.960
- Hey, are you on tonight?
- No, I'm not.

37:12.235 --> 37:14.906
- How much fluid did you give him?
- Two liters wide open.

37:14.914 --> 37:17.211
- What do we got?
- Seventeen-year-old, 3 gunshot wounds...

37:17.284 --> 37:18.935
to the right chest. One to the left.

37:19.003 --> 37:21.873
BP 90 over 60, pulse 120.
Intubated in the field.

37:21.881 --> 37:25.333
- He needs a bilateral chest tube.
- One for you and one for me.

37:25.344 --> 37:30.457
Malucci, you do a central line.
On my count. One, two, three.

37:30.910 --> 37:34.427
- Two chest tubes and a central line.
- Only got one chest tray.

37:34.639 --> 37:37.213
- Get another.
- We'll share. 10-blade.

37:42.274 --> 37:45.146
- BP's 80. Pulse ox 92.
- Curved Kelly.

37:45.362 --> 37:48.197
- Twenty cc's for the lab.
- O-neg is here.

37:48.407 --> 37:49.606
Chest tube.

37:51.953 --> 37:55.193
Get this damn thing out of my way!
Somebody grab this badge and flip it.

37:57.344 --> 38:00.062
- Stitch, please.
- I'm in. Lock and load the infuser.

38:00.073 --> 38:03.590
- BP's down to 70.
-100 cc's on the right.

38:03.603 --> 38:07.340
- We got bleeding on your side, Dr. Greene.
- Ok, where's Benton?

38:07.357 --> 38:09.315
He got off at 6.

38:11.253 --> 38:14.141
We need a surgeon down here now!

38:19.414 --> 38:24.242
Give me the Foley. Come on!
30 cc syringe for Dr. Greene.

38:24.871 --> 38:26.781
- What are you doing?
- Check the balloon.

38:26.799 --> 38:29.834
- What are you doing?
- Check the balloon. Come on.

38:31.221 --> 38:35.171
If we can't put pressure on the bleeder
from the outside, we do it on the inside.

38:37.312 --> 38:39.589
Pressure's down to 60.

38:39.607 --> 38:41.088
All right, tell me when.

38:41.309 --> 38:43.432
20 cc's.

38:45.189 --> 38:47.515
There's 30 cc's.

38:50.028 --> 38:53.612
- Chest tube output's down to a trickle.
- Pressure's up to 80.

38:53.825 --> 38:56.543
Old army trick to tamponade
the subclavian.

38:56.554 --> 38:59.872
- Cool.
- Very cool.

39:01.819 --> 39:04.045
Let's get him up to the O.R.

39:22.412 --> 39:24.071
Dr. Carter?

39:26.242 --> 39:29.209
- How is she?
- She's resting comfortably.

39:29.321 --> 39:31.579
You can go in if you like.

39:49.322 --> 39:51.147
- Hey, Luka.
- Hey.

39:51.157 --> 39:53.600
- Want a lift?
- In that?

39:53.819 --> 39:57.687
It's my mom's. I had to pick up
some stuff from work.

39:57.958 --> 39:59.783
- What, baby stuff?
- Yeah.

39:59.952 --> 40:02.075
Okay.

40:09.714 --> 40:11.506
- Here we are.
- Yeah.

40:11.851 --> 40:13.545
Let's see...

40:22.156 --> 40:24.856
- Let's get him this.
- He's 9 months old.

40:24.927 --> 40:27.819
You're never too early to start.

40:36.916 --> 40:39.072
Carlos, do you think your daddy's silly?

40:39.286 --> 40:44.546
What about this? You like one
of these? "Pull over. Pull over."

40:45.294 --> 40:47.019
He is silly.

40:47.188 --> 40:52.016
Elizabeth, I wanted to apologize
for being abrupt.

40:52.028 --> 40:54.002
- You mean rude.
- Yes.

40:54.114 --> 40:55.792
I'll think about it.

40:55.966 --> 40:59.602
You could apologize actually
for that crap at the head CT.

40:59.621 --> 41:03.350
What?! No way on earth will I apologize
for that. You put me on the spot.

41:03.376 --> 41:05.613
Yeah, but I expected you
to give the right answer.

41:05.688 --> 41:07.464
The right answer?

41:07.973 --> 41:10.565
That Lawrence is still bugging you,
isn't he?

41:11.085 --> 41:12.912
Just because he can diagnose something...

41:12.941 --> 41:15.395
without having to order
every test in the book.

41:15.708 --> 41:17.272
He may have some fancy moves in Trauma...

41:17.367 --> 41:20.231
but he doesn't know
how to function in an inner-city ER.

41:20.339 --> 41:22.942
- You're afraid you might learn something?
- He's too slow,

41:22.977 --> 41:24.420
he spends hours with every patient,

41:24.504 --> 41:28.415
and then he ties up the residents
chattering on about the Radovici sign.

41:28.692 --> 41:31.600
- The what?
- You don't know about that?

41:31.620 --> 41:34.442
- No, what is it?
- I don't think I should tell you.

41:34.708 --> 41:36.533
Mark.

41:37.503 --> 41:40.989
Just one more.
Come on, Reece, please. Okay.

41:41.216 --> 41:43.124
Maybe not.

41:43.761 --> 41:46.513
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

41:47.191 --> 41:50.179
What are you doing?
Jackie, you think he looks like me?

41:50.295 --> 41:53.847
I hope not. He's got enough problems.

41:55.635 --> 41:57.975
Hey, when I was a kid,
did I have a lot of ear infections?

41:57.988 --> 42:01.939
I don't know, Peter. I was your sister,
not your mother.

42:02.060 --> 42:05.945
You were a scrawny little thing.
Always coming down with something.

42:06.123 --> 42:08.082
No wonder you got into medicine.

42:08.160 --> 42:09.905
Thanks.

42:10.654 --> 42:12.994
I'll take him up to bed.

42:15.385 --> 42:17.709
- Do the washing up.
- All right.

42:17.721 --> 42:21.173
Dry up too. Don't leave everything
just sitting on the side.

42:23.546 --> 42:26.813
I love you. Do you love me?
Get out of here.

42:27.025 --> 42:29.218
Come on, my baby.

42:46.409 --> 42:50.839
- You live here?
- I told you it's in the water.

42:50.956 --> 42:55.884
- Yeah, but I mean, is it sanitary?
- Sure.

42:56.255 --> 43:00.803
- What do you do in winter?
- In winter I go south.

43:01.470 --> 43:03.348
Like the birds.

43:04.265 --> 43:09.394
- Thank you for the lift.
- Sure. See you.

43:12.592 --> 43:14.368
Sure.

43:28.096 --> 43:31.432
You scratch the thenar eminence...

43:31.600 --> 43:36.228
causing ipsilateral contractions
of the chin muscles.

43:36.239 --> 43:38.316
Definitely contracting.

43:38.334 --> 43:41.569
- Is that a good thing?
- Sadly, no.

43:41.880 --> 43:45.965
It indicates increased
intracranial pressure.

43:46.044 --> 43:48.266
Disturbances of the brain.

43:49.039 --> 43:52.512
Which explains why
you're working with Romano.
