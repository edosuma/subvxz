WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:03.295
Previously on "Manifest"...

00:03.295 --> 00:04.630
Zeke, I will never give up
on you

00:04.630 --> 00:06.298
for as long
as we both shall live.

00:06.298 --> 00:09.134
Officiant: I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

00:10.636 --> 00:12.262
-Police!
-Don't move!

00:12.262 --> 00:14.932
Michaela: We found over
$1 million worth of meth

00:14.932 --> 00:16.475
in your place, Jace.
I'm just thinking about

00:16.475 --> 00:19.019
the best way to hurt you
the most.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.021
The Major --
she had me fired,

00:21.021 --> 00:22.397
and I need to know
why she's after me now.

00:22.397 --> 00:25.275
The Major found a breakthrough
with your research.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.110
I think it's time for me
to make you disappear.

00:27.110 --> 00:28.820
I am not hiding from her.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.198
I am coming after her.

00:37.663 --> 00:39.414
Cal:
Auntie Mick! Help!

00:39.414 --> 00:40.874
Jace:
You have two choices --

00:40.874 --> 00:43.335
you get us back our stash
or you bury your nephew!

00:43.335 --> 00:44.544
Don't you dare
touch him!

00:44.544 --> 00:46.255
I warned you.

00:46.255 --> 00:47.464
Now you're gonna pay.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.886
Where is my son?
I don't know,

00:52.886 --> 00:54.179
but we will get him back,
Grace.
But why take Cal?

00:54.179 --> 00:56.223
What does he have to do
with anything?

00:56.223 --> 00:58.976
I think they're getting back
at me.

00:58.976 --> 01:01.144
What does that even mean?
I arrested these dealers.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.562
They want their meth back.
But it's more than that.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.314
The main guy --
he was taunting me.

01:04.314 --> 01:06.149
It's like he knew that I had
this Calling to let him go.

01:06.149 --> 01:08.151
Why didn't you?!
I don't know, okay?

01:08.151 --> 01:08.986
I screwed up.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.862
But I will fix this.
How?

01:10.862 --> 01:12.281
I'm gonna give them
what they want.

01:12.281 --> 01:13.991
I'll get the meth back
from the evidence locker room

01:13.991 --> 01:15.242
by 8:00 a.m.
They will call --

01:15.242 --> 01:17.536
8:00?!
How are you gonna do that?

01:17.536 --> 01:19.204
What did the precinct say?
I haven't --

01:19.204 --> 01:20.789
I haven't called them.

01:20.789 --> 01:22.499
Are you kidding me?
There isn't enough time,

01:22.499 --> 01:25.419
and if I bring in any more cops,
they said they will kill Cal.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.921
Oh, my God.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.632
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:30.632 --> 01:33.093
Grace, I swear to you,
I will fix this.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.386
Do not --

01:34.386 --> 01:38.015
Do not swear anything to me,
'cause you don't know.

01:40.559 --> 01:42.269
The Calling --
the plane exploding --

01:42.269 --> 01:43.395
it was about Cal.

01:43.395 --> 01:44.604
None of that matters.

01:44.604 --> 01:48.191
Michaela,
get me my son back.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.613
You should be
with your family.

01:53.613 --> 01:54.740
I'm okay.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.616
You're not okay.

01:57.701 --> 01:59.828
Your death date
is tomorrow,

01:59.828 --> 02:03.248
and all of this stuff
is just --

02:03.248 --> 02:06.460
Hey.
They're gonna find him.

02:09.171 --> 02:10.922
I got to go
to the precinct.

02:10.922 --> 02:13.342
Be here when I get back,
okay?

02:13.342 --> 02:15.385
I promise.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.336
Vance: She goes to a midtown
office building

02:49.336 --> 02:50.921
every morning
for a few hours.

02:50.921 --> 02:52.672
Then she takes a ferry
downtown,

02:52.672 --> 02:54.716
spends the afternoon
in a windowless building

02:54.716 --> 02:56.385
at Church and Thomas.

02:56.385 --> 02:58.929
This is all
within the last two weeks.

02:58.929 --> 03:01.139
It's only a matter of time
before we identify

03:01.139 --> 03:04.267
one of her scientists
and find out what she's learned.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.394
Time is something
we don't have.

03:05.394 --> 03:07.187
We have
to do something now.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.022
You said you wanted
to see her for yourself, right?

03:09.022 --> 03:10.816
Well, there she is.

03:10.816 --> 03:13.068
But moving on the Major
is no simple op.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.986
We go too fast, it's more
than just your friend

03:14.986 --> 03:16.780
who's gonna end up dead.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.031
Okay. So, now what?

03:18.031 --> 03:19.366
My guys and I are gonna stay
on her.

03:19.366 --> 03:22.786
You need to sit tight
and hope for a miracle.

03:25.122 --> 03:26.498
I prefer science
over miracles.

03:26.498 --> 03:28.458
I don't think that's an option
we have right now.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.709
Come on.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.757
That's a lot of meth. You sure
you need the whole thing?

03:35.757 --> 03:38.218
Yeah. I sent in a tainted sample
to the lab.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.761
Now they got to retest
the whole batch,

03:39.761 --> 03:41.930
and, you know,
Captain's pissed.

03:41.930 --> 03:44.141
I need your signature.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.397
What are you trying
to pull?

03:50.397 --> 03:52.941
System says Jared Vasquez,
lead detective.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.943
You're on leave.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.361
Does it look like
I'm on leave?

03:59.781 --> 04:01.324
Detective Vasquez,
please.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.881
You know anything about
a methamphetamine lab test?

04:15.881 --> 04:17.257
Stone's not authorized.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.676
Says here she left
to get married.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.347
What, and this is
her honeymoon?

04:25.682 --> 04:27.100
I need
an authorized signature

04:27.100 --> 04:29.269
before I can release
any evidence.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.746
Thank you.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.500
Sorry. It was not supposed
to go that way.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.502
Yeah, I didn't think it was.
What are we up to?

04:53.502 --> 04:55.170
No, don't worry about it.
Just go back to your desk.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.047
Don't get involved.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.591
Mick, I just signed out
an industrial-size box
of methamphetamine.

04:59.591 --> 05:00.967
I'd say I'm involved.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.470
Hey. Hey.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.846
What are you up to?

05:06.181 --> 05:08.558
Cal's been kidnapped.
What?

05:08.558 --> 05:10.435
I'm trading the meth
to get him back.

05:10.435 --> 05:11.937
You don't know that,
okay?

05:11.937 --> 05:13.814
Hey, wait.
Jared,
you know as well as I do

05:13.814 --> 05:15.398
that the only way
to get him home safe

05:15.398 --> 05:17.359
is to pay the ransom.

05:17.359 --> 05:18.443
This is it.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.698
Let's get him home.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.376
Ellen.

05:36.878 --> 05:39.047
Or is it Katherine?

05:39.047 --> 05:42.342
Major General
Katherine Fitz?

05:42.342 --> 05:44.719
Saanvi.

05:44.719 --> 05:47.806
To what do I owe
this surprise?

05:47.806 --> 05:49.474
You have something I want.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.364
Kory:
Do you have our product?

06:04.364 --> 06:06.157
Yeah.
Let me talk to Cal.

06:06.157 --> 06:07.450
I'm assuming
you weren't stupid enough

06:07.450 --> 06:10.161
to tell any of your friends
at the department.

06:10.161 --> 06:12.956
No. Let me talk to Cal.
I need to make sure he's okay.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.461
Remember when I promised you
hellfire and fury?

06:18.461 --> 06:20.171
Jace, please don't --

06:20.171 --> 06:22.090
Please don't hurt him.

06:22.090 --> 06:25.135
If I don't get back what's mine,
I'm not gonna hurt him.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.886
I'm gonna kill him.

06:29.889 --> 06:32.267
And what exactly is it
you want?

06:32.267 --> 06:33.685
You've had a breakthrough.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.145
It's why you pulled
my medical license,

06:35.145 --> 06:36.646
had me shut down.

06:36.646 --> 06:40.567
Sounds like you've gotten
some help from beyond the grave.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.527
So Vance lived.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.821
Surprise, surprise.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.699
He has eyes on us
right now.

06:47.699 --> 06:49.492
Still not much of a liar.

06:49.492 --> 06:50.493
No, he doesn't.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.579
You're freelancing.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.831
People are gonna die.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.125
I need to find a cure.
You stole my work?

06:57.125 --> 06:59.127
Your country thanks you
for your contribution

06:59.127 --> 07:00.587
to its defense.

07:02.213 --> 07:05.216
What if I have more
to offer?

07:05.216 --> 07:08.053
If you tell me how to get rid
of the genetic mutation,

07:08.053 --> 07:10.013
I can give you
a complete medical profile

07:10.013 --> 07:11.931
on a man
with an identical mutation

07:11.931 --> 07:13.308
who wasn't
on Flight 828.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.268
You mean Zeke Landon?

07:16.561 --> 07:20.565
You don't think I have you
and the Stone family monitored?

07:20.565 --> 07:23.818
It was a beautiful wedding,
by the way.

07:23.818 --> 07:24.903
You're right.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.530
Zeke Landon was crucial.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.407
Without
his exonic sequences,

07:29.407 --> 07:31.534
I never would have found
what I was looking for.

07:31.534 --> 07:35.288
Unfortunately for you,
that means that you have...

07:35.288 --> 07:36.706
nothing to offer.

07:36.706 --> 07:40.085
I have more than enough proof
to go public.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.544
Careful, Saanvi.

07:41.544 --> 07:45.340
Those are the kinds of threats
that get people killed.

07:45.340 --> 07:48.718
You really think you're ready
to play at that level?

07:51.680 --> 07:54.057
Ohh.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.934
This is my stop.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.894
It was nice
to see you.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.492
I need you to get me
a lab.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.828
So, we're supposed to leave
a duffel bag of meth

08:14.828 --> 08:16.788
under a bench and, what --

08:16.788 --> 08:19.165
hope for the best?
They'll show us Cal's okay,

08:19.165 --> 08:20.667
and once they confirm
what they've got,

08:20.667 --> 08:22.544
they'll release him.
And what if they don't?

08:22.544 --> 08:24.003
What if they just take the drugs
and run?

08:24.003 --> 08:25.964
They don't want Cal.

08:25.964 --> 08:28.216
Are you actually on board
with this?

08:29.592 --> 08:32.470
Okay, look, no cop's
ever supposed to say this

08:32.470 --> 08:34.806
to a family
of a hostage.

08:34.806 --> 08:36.057
As dangerous as this is,

08:36.057 --> 08:39.018
involving the NYPD can make
matters worse.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.479
They're trying to make
an arrest.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.022
Things can go sideways.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.401
Well, we don't want
to risk that.

08:46.401 --> 08:48.027
No, we don't.
Exactly.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.655
Look, all that matters here
is that we get Cal back safely.

08:50.655 --> 08:54.409
So, with that being said,
Mick's plan is the way to go.

08:54.409 --> 08:56.536
It's what I would do
if it was my son.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.915
Jared will be there out of sight
if anything does go wrong.

09:05.795 --> 09:07.046
Hey. It's just me.

09:07.046 --> 09:08.798
I came in the back
in case anyone's watching.

09:08.798 --> 09:12.218
I thought maybe you guys
could use this comms gear
I borrowed from ESU.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.344
Y-You told her?

09:13.344 --> 09:15.180
She's your partner.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.223
So much for no cops.

09:17.223 --> 09:20.727
Hey. Today we're family.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.645
Okay. What happens next?

09:23.855 --> 09:26.524
They want to make the exchange
outside the Intrepid.

09:29.736 --> 09:32.739
I'll take the meth to the plaza
near the main entrance.

09:34.866 --> 09:37.494
Ben will be at the overpass,
waiting for them to show up.

09:37.494 --> 09:40.246
Once they do, I'll put the bag
under the bench.

09:40.246 --> 09:43.041
Jared:
They'll recognize Drea and me,
so we'll stay out of sight --

09:43.041 --> 09:44.834
make sure everything
goes off okay.

09:54.511 --> 09:55.637
Where the hell
are they?

09:55.637 --> 09:56.679
Ben,
they'll be here.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.515
I got eyes on you both.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.648
Okay. Here we go.

10:06.648 --> 10:09.192
Two guys, far side
of the bridge, with Cal.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.238
I see him.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.538
He's okay.

10:29.212 --> 10:30.755
Yeah.
I got eyes on her.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.218
I've made contact.

10:35.218 --> 10:37.136
Good, Mick.
Nice and easy, alright?

10:37.136 --> 10:38.972
Go on. Head out.

10:45.103 --> 10:47.355
Louanne:
Excuse me! Young lady!

10:47.355 --> 10:50.441
Excuse me!
You left your bag!

10:50.441 --> 10:51.860
Uh...

10:51.860 --> 10:53.945
Thank you.

10:53.945 --> 10:56.906
Look, I'm a cop, okay?
I need you to just walk away.

10:56.906 --> 11:01.286
Really? I can get one of those
for 10 bucks down on Canal.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.997
Excuse me! Officer!

11:03.997 --> 11:05.290
Ben:
Mick, what's going on?

11:05.290 --> 11:06.332
Good Samaritan.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.750
Drea: Damn it, lady.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.752
Louanne: This lady's saying
she's a cop.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.379
She left a bag
under the bench.

11:11.379 --> 11:12.755
Officer: Alright, thanks.

11:12.755 --> 11:15.717
I did that on purpose.
I can explain, okay?

11:15.717 --> 11:17.927
Lady, cop or not, you can't
just leave your bag unattended.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.138
I am a detective
at the 129th.

11:22.724 --> 11:24.350
Ben: This is taking too long.
I got to get Cal!

11:24.350 --> 11:26.895
Jared: Ben, Mick's taking care
of it. Hang in tight.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.314
You're about to blow an
undercover operation right now.

11:29.314 --> 11:30.815
I'll see
what my sergeant says.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.442
We're being played.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.362
Cal!

11:36.362 --> 11:38.448
We got to
head down there.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.951
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no!

11:41.951 --> 11:42.911
Hey!
Cal!

11:42.911 --> 11:43.953
What the hell?!

11:43.953 --> 11:45.747
Cal!
Hey! Watch it!

11:47.916 --> 11:50.001
Cal!!

11:50.001 --> 11:52.211
Cal!

11:59.135 --> 12:02.013
Somebody want to explain to me
how a duffel bag of meth

12:02.013 --> 12:03.765
that's supposed to be
in the evidence locker

12:03.765 --> 12:05.558
was a part of
a failed hostage exchange?!

12:05.558 --> 12:07.977
Captain --
I've got Midtown North
making noise

12:07.977 --> 12:09.812
that we didn't give them
a heads-up on an undercover op,

12:09.812 --> 12:11.439
and the chief wants to know
what's up

12:11.439 --> 12:13.024
with our evidentiary chain
of custody!

12:13.024 --> 12:16.319
They took my nephew.
And you should have
come to me.

12:16.319 --> 12:19.822
Haven't I convinced you of that,
after all we've been through?

12:19.822 --> 12:22.200
Cap, she couldn't. There was
a ticking clock on the exchange.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.826
And we have procedures,
damn it!

12:23.826 --> 12:25.620
And as long as you work
in this precinct,

12:25.620 --> 12:27.288
you will follow them!

12:28.915 --> 12:30.416
If you think
that I give a damn

12:30.416 --> 12:32.210
about anything
other than saving my nephew --

12:32.210 --> 12:33.378
You're quitting the force?

12:33.378 --> 12:34.420
Yeah, if I have to.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.339
I'm bringing Cal back.

12:37.340 --> 12:38.758
Stone.

12:39.634 --> 12:41.970
Resignation not accepted.

12:41.970 --> 12:44.597
From here on out...

12:44.597 --> 12:47.183
we do things my way.

12:49.060 --> 12:51.187
I told you it was stupid
to do it in public like that!

12:51.187 --> 12:52.689
This is on you!

12:52.689 --> 12:54.232
You're the one who wanted
to take a hostage.

12:54.232 --> 12:55.525
Now we're stuck with him.

12:55.525 --> 12:56.567
And how the hell else
are we supposed

12:56.567 --> 12:57.986
to get back our supply,
huh?!

12:57.986 --> 13:00.029
This isn't about the supply,
and you know it.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.823
You just wanted revenge.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.700
We should just ditch the kid
and head for Canada.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.660
The kid's the only leverage
we have!

13:10.039 --> 13:12.208
Hey.

13:12.208 --> 13:15.336
You must be cold, huh?

13:15.336 --> 13:18.172
It's -- It's okay.
I'm...

13:18.172 --> 13:20.758
I-I'm not gonna hurt you.

13:20.758 --> 13:23.928
I know you're not,
but...

13:23.928 --> 13:26.264
he wants to kill me.

13:27.473 --> 13:31.227
Uh, no. He --

13:31.227 --> 13:35.940
My -- My brother's
just...angry.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.568
I'm not scared,
but...

13:38.568 --> 13:40.403
my sister must be.

13:40.403 --> 13:44.323
You -- You have a sister?

13:44.323 --> 13:46.034
Two, actually.

13:46.034 --> 13:50.079
Eden's just a baby,
and Olive's my twin.

13:50.079 --> 13:51.998
She worries about me.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.584
I just wish I could send her
a message,

13:54.584 --> 13:57.045
just to say
everything's alright.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.184
He was wearing jeans

14:11.184 --> 14:14.062
and a red bubble coat --
bright red.

14:14.062 --> 14:15.938
This is a disaster.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.456
Ben, I'm --

14:33.456 --> 14:35.792
I'm sorry.

14:41.214 --> 14:44.008
What more do you want from me?
I'm already dying inside.

14:47.303 --> 14:50.098
We're supposed to follow
the Callings.

14:50.098 --> 14:52.266
That's --

14:52.266 --> 14:55.311
That's all
you had to do.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.896
Then these bastards
would have died

14:56.896 --> 14:58.481
in that meth-lab explosion,
like they were supposed to,

14:58.481 --> 14:59.482
and Cal would be
home safe.

14:59.482 --> 15:00.733
Yeah, maybe he would,

15:00.733 --> 15:02.777
but now we have to --
No, not maybe.

15:02.777 --> 15:05.238
I told you all other paths
lead to disaster.

15:05.238 --> 15:08.491
You -- You didn't listen.

15:08.491 --> 15:12.537
Listen to what, Ben --
let him go?

15:12.537 --> 15:15.623
I am sick to my stomach,
but it didn't make sense.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.166
You didn't want it
to make sense!

15:17.166 --> 15:20.211
How could I, Ben?!
That is a voice in my head,

15:20.211 --> 15:22.004
telling me to let Zeke die

15:22.004 --> 15:24.465
or to let three
scumbag drug dealers go.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.259
That's not a voice
I want to listen to.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.052
We don't have a choice!

15:31.097 --> 15:34.142
If we have zero control
over what we do,

15:34.142 --> 15:36.894
then what was the point of us
coming back in the first place?

15:39.772 --> 15:41.983
This.

15:41.983 --> 15:43.234
This.

15:43.234 --> 15:44.235
This.

15:44.235 --> 15:45.278
This, this.

15:45.278 --> 15:48.990
This, this,
this is the point!

15:48.990 --> 15:51.450
All of this was dumped in my lap
and yours. We were chosen.

15:51.450 --> 15:52.910
I don't know how,
I don't know why,

15:52.910 --> 15:55.288
but I do know the only way
for any of us to survive

15:55.288 --> 15:56.956
is to do what
the Callings want,

15:56.956 --> 16:00.710
and I am scared to death
because you didn't...

16:00.710 --> 16:01.711
that it's too late.

16:01.711 --> 16:03.171
But we almost got him.

16:03.171 --> 16:05.006
But we didn't!

16:23.733 --> 16:25.026
What is this place?

16:25.026 --> 16:27.278
Somewhere
that doesn't exist.

16:27.278 --> 16:29.739
I also got into your lab
at the hospital

16:29.739 --> 16:32.283
and gathered up
what research I could.

16:32.283 --> 16:35.411
Just because I'm dead doesn't
mean I don't have connections.

16:35.411 --> 16:36.913
Thank you. That's --
What were you thinking,

16:36.913 --> 16:38.122
going to see the Major
on your own?

16:38.122 --> 16:39.540
I told you to hang back.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.083
You went and announced
we were watching?

16:41.083 --> 16:43.836
I'm sorry. I don't have time
to play the long game.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.088
She knows you're alive,
by the way.

16:47.298 --> 16:48.966
Well, that's terrific.

16:48.966 --> 16:51.677
Saanvi, now is not the time
to go rogue!

16:51.677 --> 16:54.680
Look, Zeke is gonna die
if I don't find a cure.

16:55.973 --> 16:58.976
What did she say that made you
think you need a lab?

16:58.976 --> 17:01.604
That Zeke's exons were
where she made the discovery.

17:01.604 --> 17:03.022
I need to run an analysis
to see

17:03.022 --> 17:04.774
if I can find
a stable solution.

17:04.774 --> 17:06.609
I just need to load
Zeke's sequence data

17:06.609 --> 17:08.069
into the simulator.

17:10.404 --> 17:11.781
What?

17:11.781 --> 17:14.158
It's gonna take longer
than I thought.

17:14.158 --> 17:16.160
Well, look
at the bright side.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.870
You may have a cure
in a week.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.123
That's six days too late
to save Zeke.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.983
Zeke. Zeke.

17:48.526 --> 17:50.152
I saw him -- Cal.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.279
Where is he?

17:51.279 --> 17:53.155
Somewhere
in the wilderness...

17:53.155 --> 17:54.907
where I die.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.325
Zeke, you are not dying,
okay?

17:56.325 --> 17:58.744
No one is dying today.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.497
Here you go.

18:02.665 --> 18:03.791
Thanks.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.756
What is it?

18:10.756 --> 18:12.967
I think it's from Cal.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.220
Who's Doug?

18:18.180 --> 18:19.724
Oh, my God.

18:19.724 --> 18:22.226
Oh, my God.
I think I know where Cal is.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.986
Grace: "It's OK.
I'm not scared.

18:31.986 --> 18:33.487
Tell Mom and Doug
I love them."

18:33.487 --> 18:34.864
Mom and Doug?

18:34.864 --> 18:36.407
Doug, as in the Dugout,

18:36.407 --> 18:39.201
that sketchy diner
with the happy-face pancakes.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.203
In the Catskills,
from years ago?

18:41.203 --> 18:42.538
By the ski mountain.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.874
Cal and I were obsessed
over that place,

18:44.874 --> 18:46.625
so we named it "Doug."

18:46.625 --> 18:49.086
We used to joke about
who loves Doug the most.

18:49.086 --> 18:51.339
The Dugout,
outside Liberty.

18:53.841 --> 18:56.177
Zeke:
That photo -- zoom in.

18:58.220 --> 19:01.682
Those power lines --
I saw them in my Calling.

19:01.682 --> 19:04.226
Same configuration,
same kind of tower.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.187
That's got to be where he is.
We got to get up there.

19:06.187 --> 19:07.438
No. We got to tell
the cops.

19:07.438 --> 19:08.939
Ben, if we involve
the state police,

19:08.939 --> 19:10.900
they're gonna bring in
a TAC team, helicopter --

19:10.900 --> 19:12.777
Again with this?
Mick, we tried it your way.

19:12.777 --> 19:14.695
It didn't work.
It still can.

19:14.695 --> 19:17.156
I saw Cal. He's there.

19:18.574 --> 19:21.619
You don't have to trust me,
but trust the Callings.

19:21.619 --> 19:23.871
Hey. So, the text was sent
from an app.

19:23.871 --> 19:25.623
Tech can't trace it.

19:29.085 --> 19:30.294
What?

19:32.963 --> 19:35.299
Guys,
I'm on your team.

19:37.259 --> 19:39.011
Alright.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.596
We need you
to run interference.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.809
They need you
in the kitchen.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.524
Thanks.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.858
Thanks.

19:54.443 --> 19:55.861
Hey.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.321
The only way
we're gonna save Cal

19:57.321 --> 19:58.906
is if we do this together.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.282
That's how we got
this far,

20:00.282 --> 20:02.159
and that's how we're gonna
bring him home.

20:05.371 --> 20:06.664
Hey.
What's going on?

20:06.664 --> 20:08.541
I'm coming, too.
No, Zeke.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.876
If your body temperature drops
too low, you will die.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.378
I told him.
He won't listen.

20:12.378 --> 20:13.504
Saanvi's still working
on a cure.

20:13.504 --> 20:15.131
She needs you here,
close by.

20:15.131 --> 20:16.757
No. I got the Calling.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.342
I'm supposed to help.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.219
If today's the day I die,

20:20.219 --> 20:22.388
I'm not going to my grave
knowing Cal was in trouble

20:22.388 --> 20:24.557
but I just stayed home,
trying to save myself.

20:30.479 --> 20:31.313
Come on.

20:34.608 --> 20:35.901
Jared.

20:37.528 --> 20:40.030
When I'm gone...

20:40.030 --> 20:42.450
I'm glad you'll be here...

20:42.450 --> 20:43.784
for her.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.330
Stay warm, okay?

20:58.507 --> 21:00.760
Reporter: And we continue to
track the ongoing manhunt

21:00.760 --> 21:04.221
for three escaped suspects
in a narcotics-trafficking ring

21:04.221 --> 21:05.848
now believed to have abducted
a boy

21:05.848 --> 21:09.351
from his family's residence
in Hollis Hills, Queens.

21:09.351 --> 21:10.936
The search for Cal Stone,

21:10.936 --> 21:14.231
one of Montego Air 828's
returned passengers,

21:14.231 --> 21:15.483
has expanded statewide,

21:15.483 --> 21:17.610
and an Amber Alert
has been issued.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.487
Pete: We're screwed!

21:19.487 --> 21:21.405
A-A-An Amber Alert?

21:21.405 --> 21:23.282
That means every single person
with a phone

21:23.282 --> 21:24.492
is gonna be looking
for us.

21:24.492 --> 21:25.951
Kory: People swipe those away
to get back

21:25.951 --> 21:27.745
to their porn
and their Snapchat.

21:27.745 --> 21:30.789
But statewide means we'll never
be able to cross the border.

21:30.789 --> 21:32.833
Real good plan!
Shut up.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.045
Where the hell
did this kid get a blanket?

21:36.045 --> 21:38.172
I-I-I thought
he might be cold.

21:38.172 --> 21:39.757
You don't get to think.

21:39.757 --> 21:40.925
Hey!

21:46.180 --> 21:47.348
Don't make me use this.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.311
Now is not the time
to go soft.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.503
No one in the diner
has seen Cal.

22:17.503 --> 22:19.296
Grace: They probably
just drove by.

22:20.923 --> 22:22.633
Do you see the power lines
up ahead?

22:22.633 --> 22:23.592
Yeah.

22:23.592 --> 22:25.052
They jut up into the woods,

22:25.052 --> 22:27.888
and they splinter off
in two different directions.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.098
Kidnappers are gonna be
looking

22:29.098 --> 22:30.474
for a secluded place
to hide out.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.434
They're gonna want
to stay away from the ski areas

22:32.434 --> 22:34.186
and probably stick to something
with less traffic.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.313
Olive: All the skiing
is to the left.

22:36.313 --> 22:38.774
I-It has to be
on the right.

22:38.774 --> 22:39.775
Okay.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.531
Bowers:
Afternoon, everybody.

22:45.531 --> 22:46.824
Any updates?

22:46.824 --> 22:48.659
Nothing yet, Captain.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.583
Oh, hey, Captain.
Can I get you something?

22:55.583 --> 22:57.543
No, you can't get me something.
Where are Stone and Vasquez?

22:57.543 --> 22:59.253
Vasquez is in here.
I can get him for you.

23:03.299 --> 23:04.758
What's happening in here?

23:04.758 --> 23:06.218
Where are the others?

23:08.554 --> 23:09.972
Vasquez?

23:09.972 --> 23:12.016
Mikami?

23:12.016 --> 23:13.976
One of you is gonna open
your mouth this second,

23:13.976 --> 23:15.644
or someone
is getting suspended.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.271
They're heading upstate.

23:19.898 --> 23:22.818
It's where we think
Cal is being held.

23:24.528 --> 23:26.488
I'm calling state patrol.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.699
Hopefully, they can create
a perimeter

23:28.699 --> 23:29.825
before it's too late.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.328
W-- Uh, t-too late to what,
e-exactly?

23:32.328 --> 23:34.538
Intercept the kidnappers,
overwhelm them,

23:34.538 --> 23:35.873
negotiate with them.

23:35.873 --> 23:37.708
We have established
procedures, tactics.

23:37.708 --> 23:40.502
Can you just hold on --
just stop for one second?

23:40.502 --> 23:42.880
These tactics sound like
the kind of thing

23:42.880 --> 23:44.506
that could endanger
a hostage.

23:44.506 --> 23:48.177
We're professionals, ma'am.
You need to let us do our job.

23:49.637 --> 23:53.641
Captain, with all due respect,
this is my son.

23:53.641 --> 23:56.810
If you do anything to jeopardize
him coming home to me safely,

23:56.810 --> 23:59.938
I swear to God, you'll wish
you didn't wake up this morning.

24:06.695 --> 24:07.821
Don't look at me.

24:11.867 --> 24:15.037
Michaela thinks
she can save him.

24:15.037 --> 24:16.872
I trust her.

24:24.838 --> 24:27.800
You're lucky
I'm a mother.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.427
I can keep them offline
for now.

24:30.427 --> 24:33.597
You two start up there
and get local PD on standby.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.738
Ben:

24:49.738 --> 24:52.157
Didn't Olive say
there were cabins off this road?

24:52.157 --> 24:53.367
I don't have any signal.

24:53.367 --> 24:55.577
Did we miss
a turn-off somewhere?

24:55.577 --> 24:56.662
Keep driving.

24:56.662 --> 24:58.122
It's a dead end.

25:02.126 --> 25:03.627
Do you know
where we're going?

25:03.627 --> 25:05.713
Farther.

25:12.219 --> 25:14.722
Mick, look --
trailhead.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.267
Looks like we're on foot
from here.

25:20.185 --> 25:21.687
I'm coming.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.647
No, Zeke. It's below freezing
out there.

25:25.733 --> 25:27.443
You won't make it.

25:32.823 --> 25:34.074
Can you give us a sec?

25:45.210 --> 25:46.670
It's warm in here,
okay?

25:52.468 --> 25:55.679
Can you hold on till I get back?

25:55.679 --> 25:56.972
In case I don't --

25:56.972 --> 25:58.348
You're not gonna die.

25:58.348 --> 26:01.059
Michaela...it's okay.

26:01.059 --> 26:02.978
This isn't how
it's supposed to happen.

26:02.978 --> 26:04.480
This is wrong.

26:05.522 --> 26:09.026
I got everything
I ever wanted in life.

26:11.779 --> 26:13.614
And more than I deserved.

26:41.850 --> 26:43.852
I got to get Cal.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.312
I know.

26:46.855 --> 26:50.776
When you do,
tell him I loved him.

27:20.222 --> 27:21.640
Again? Really?

27:22.850 --> 27:24.643
No. We're not done.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.854
Little girl, it's time
you open your eyes

27:26.854 --> 27:29.189
to how things work
in the real world.

27:29.189 --> 27:32.651
My job is to protect
this country.

27:32.651 --> 27:33.694
You are...

27:33.694 --> 27:36.822
an insect
on the bottom of my shoe.

27:36.822 --> 27:38.740
I already said
I had zero interest

27:38.740 --> 27:40.325
in helping you save
your --

27:44.329 --> 27:45.873
...your friend.

27:45.873 --> 27:48.876
Why would my response
be any different now that --

27:50.711 --> 27:52.796
Are you having trouble
breathing?

27:52.796 --> 27:54.172
It's early stage
anaphylaxis.

27:55.841 --> 27:56.967
Not so early.

27:58.802 --> 28:01.221
You have 90 seconds
to tell me how to save Zeke,

28:01.221 --> 28:03.974
or it will be too late
to save yourself.

28:03.974 --> 28:07.185
Now Zeke isn't the only one
who has an expiration date.

28:07.185 --> 28:08.270
You have one.

28:08.270 --> 28:10.230
Fine. Give me the shot.

28:10.230 --> 28:11.523
Tell me how to save Zeke.

28:11.523 --> 28:14.151
You're not a killer, Saanvi.

28:14.151 --> 28:16.194
I need the cure.

28:16.194 --> 28:18.405
This is not who you are!

28:25.913 --> 28:27.873
Or maybe it is.

28:27.873 --> 28:30.542
Tell me how to save Zeke.
How do I save the passengers?

28:30.542 --> 28:32.669
There is no cure.

28:33.754 --> 28:36.506
What's the point
of a powerful mutation

28:36.506 --> 28:41.053
if you can't replicate
and weaponize it?

28:41.053 --> 28:42.846
You were gonna
infect people?

28:42.846 --> 28:44.097
Help me.

28:46.350 --> 28:48.977
It's too --

28:48.977 --> 28:50.812
It's too late.

28:50.812 --> 28:53.523
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

28:53.523 --> 28:55.943
I'm sorry.
This isn't what I wanted.

29:18.924 --> 29:19.925
Zeke!

30:00.799 --> 30:02.884
I mean,
how far have we gone?

30:02.884 --> 30:05.929
I can't even see if we're still
on course with the power lines.

30:05.929 --> 30:07.889
I think we are.

30:18.525 --> 30:19.943
Lights out.

30:19.943 --> 30:21.903
Son of a...

30:21.903 --> 30:23.447
Pete: What the hell?

30:23.447 --> 30:25.115
Someone's coming.

30:28.910 --> 30:30.328
Out the back -- now.

30:30.328 --> 30:32.622
What about the kid?
What about the kid?

30:32.622 --> 30:34.207
Slit his throat.

30:34.207 --> 30:36.668
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Nobody's slitting anything.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.211
You don't call
the shots!

30:38.211 --> 30:39.880
I didn't sign up
for murder one!

30:39.880 --> 30:41.673
We take him
or we leave him!

30:41.673 --> 30:43.175
We take him
and he slows us down!

30:43.175 --> 30:46.094
We leave him and he tells
the cops what we're driving!

31:05.155 --> 31:07.157
Kory:
Have you lost your mind?!

31:07.157 --> 31:08.200
He's just a kid!

31:08.200 --> 31:09.326
Jace: So what?
Go.

31:09.326 --> 31:10.619
We're all in this together,

31:10.619 --> 31:12.120
so either you're in
or you're out.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.163
Which is it?
I'm out!

31:13.163 --> 31:15.207
You're out of control.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.668
I'm done arguing!

31:18.668 --> 31:21.004
Cut that little --

31:21.004 --> 31:22.339
Where is he?!

31:39.773 --> 31:41.983
They must have
seen us coming.

32:11.429 --> 32:12.430
Zeke: Cal!

32:17.894 --> 32:20.063
Cal!

32:20.063 --> 32:21.189
Zeke!

32:26.319 --> 32:29.156
Michaela:
Jace! Let him go!

32:29.156 --> 32:29.990
Drop your weapon!

32:32.200 --> 32:33.493
What did I tell you?!

32:33.493 --> 32:34.911
What did I say?!

32:44.421 --> 32:46.089
No!!

32:51.094 --> 32:52.596
Michaela: Zeke! No!

32:52.596 --> 32:54.890
Zeke! No!

32:59.019 --> 33:00.437
Cal!

33:00.437 --> 33:01.980
Cal!

33:16.912 --> 33:18.079
Cal!

33:18.079 --> 33:19.998
Cal!!

33:22.709 --> 33:25.420
Cal!

33:31.468 --> 33:33.178
Zeke!

33:33.178 --> 33:34.179
Zeke!!

33:41.311 --> 33:43.438
Zeke! Zeke!!

33:54.115 --> 33:55.283
Zeke!

33:55.283 --> 33:57.285
Zeke!

33:57.285 --> 33:59.120
Zeke!

33:59.120 --> 34:00.038
Zeke!!

34:01.957 --> 34:02.999
Zeke!

34:02.999 --> 34:04.167
Zeke!

34:04.167 --> 34:06.211
Zeke!

34:06.211 --> 34:07.837
Zeke!!

34:10.257 --> 34:12.425
Zeke!

34:16.096 --> 34:17.138
Zeke.

34:17.138 --> 34:18.390
Okay.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.767
I got you. I got you.

34:26.898 --> 34:27.857
No!

34:27.857 --> 34:29.943
No! He can't die!

34:29.943 --> 34:31.152
Zeke!

34:31.152 --> 34:32.153
Zeke!

34:33.947 --> 34:35.156
Zeke!

34:54.467 --> 34:56.261
Shh. Shh.

35:20.243 --> 35:21.536
Michaela: I'm sorry.

35:21.536 --> 35:23.705
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

35:23.705 --> 35:25.957
Hey, come on.
Don't say that.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.335
It was his time.
You know that.

35:28.335 --> 35:30.045
He chose to spend it
saving Cal.

35:30.045 --> 35:33.006
Cal should have never
been here, Ben.

35:33.006 --> 35:35.008
All he wanted to do
was die peacefully in my arms,

35:35.008 --> 35:37.218
and I couldn't --
I couldn't listen.

35:37.218 --> 35:39.304
I couldn't let go of him.

36:02.035 --> 36:03.078
Zeke!

36:03.078 --> 36:04.329
Zeke!

36:04.329 --> 36:05.622
Hi!

36:06.456 --> 36:07.791
Hey.

36:07.791 --> 36:09.918
I'm still alive,
right?

36:09.918 --> 36:11.878
Yeah.

36:11.878 --> 36:13.380
Cal's safe!

36:13.380 --> 36:14.881
We're all okay!

36:14.881 --> 36:17.217
We're okay.

36:17.217 --> 36:18.426
Zeke?

37:33.501 --> 37:35.336
What do we do?

37:35.336 --> 37:36.379
What do we do?

37:36.379 --> 37:38.882
What do we do?

37:38.882 --> 37:40.508
What do we do?

37:40.508 --> 37:42.343
What do we do?

38:03.490 --> 38:06.242
Hey. Um...

38:06.242 --> 38:07.535
Zeke's crashed
on the couch,

38:07.535 --> 38:09.579
so it might be easier
if we stay the night.

38:09.579 --> 38:11.331
Yeah, of course.

38:11.331 --> 38:12.832
Here.

38:15.293 --> 38:16.461
Listen.

38:16.461 --> 38:18.505
I said a lot of things.
So did I.

38:18.505 --> 38:21.090
Obviously, you would never do
anything to hurt Cal.

38:21.090 --> 38:22.509
You were
as scared as I was,

38:22.509 --> 38:25.428
and you didn't need me
turning on you.

38:25.428 --> 38:27.388
For the record,
we both turned on me.

38:28.389 --> 38:32.352
I was sure that I'd made
the biggest mistake of my life.

38:32.352 --> 38:34.103
This was meant to happen,
Mick,

38:34.103 --> 38:35.772
so we could see
for ourselves.

38:35.772 --> 38:38.733
Zeke following the Calling,
saving Cal,

38:38.733 --> 38:42.570
that's -- that's how
he beat the death date.

38:42.570 --> 38:45.114
So...what does that mean
for us, then,

38:45.114 --> 38:46.574
for -- for the rest
of the 828ers?

38:46.574 --> 38:49.452
I mean, are we all gonna
go through some hell like this

38:49.452 --> 38:52.622
in order to survive
our death date?

38:52.622 --> 38:53.706
I don't know.

38:57.627 --> 39:00.922
You know,
when I saw the glow...

39:03.258 --> 39:06.344
...it was like
I was seeing a miracle.

39:07.887 --> 39:10.598
Maybe you were.

39:10.598 --> 39:13.142
Maybe we both were.

39:14.644 --> 39:16.563
Man, you've come around.

39:18.523 --> 39:20.692
So, then,
what does that make us?

39:22.569 --> 39:25.655
I don't know.
I just feel like a...guy.

39:25.655 --> 39:27.782
A very lucky...

39:27.782 --> 39:30.827
very confused guy.

39:31.953 --> 39:33.454
Does that mean
you're finally given up

39:33.454 --> 39:35.331
on Adrian's doomsday theory

39:35.331 --> 39:38.876
that we're all reborn agents
of the Apocalypse?

39:40.003 --> 39:41.504
I suppose I have.

39:41.504 --> 39:43.798
Although, for a minute,
it certainly felt like

39:43.798 --> 39:46.301
your meth heads
were exactly that.

39:49.345 --> 39:52.515
Good riddance
to those sons of bitches.

39:52.515 --> 39:54.309
Good riddance.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.939
Where are we?
Nowhere.

39:59.939 --> 40:01.733
We've been down there
for hours,

40:01.733 --> 40:03.526
searched every inch
of this lake.

40:03.526 --> 40:04.986
There are no bodies.

40:04.986 --> 40:08.031
Okay, That's not possible.
No one's come out of that lake.

40:08.031 --> 40:10.033
I mean,
they have to be in there.

40:10.033 --> 40:12.035
Don't know
what to tell you.

40:12.035 --> 40:13.578
They're not.
