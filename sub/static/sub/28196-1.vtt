00:03.003 --> 00:04.038
Hi, Leah.

00:05.506 --> 00:08.122
How are you?
- Thank you for agreeing to meet.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.509
There's a lot to talk about.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.432
They're not allowed to listen.

00:20.479 --> 00:21.560
Yeah, I know the rules.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here

00:47.339 --> 00:48.625
Turn over, put your legs up.

00:52.302 --> 00:54.419
Oh, I think that was the one.

00:55.681 --> 00:57.968
Seriously, I think that did it.
I've got a good feeling.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.649
<i>So, as we all know, how we behave</i>

02:35.739 --> 02:37.605
<i>whether we are good or bad</i>

02:37.741 --> 02:39.403
<i>trusting or deceitful</i>

02:39.660 --> 02:42.277
<i>is influenced by our relationship to power.</i>

02:44.623 --> 02:48.367
<i>And power manifests itself in various ways,
of course.</i>

02:48.919 --> 02:50.751
<i>The way we respond to authority</i>

02:51.171 --> 02:52.378
<i>to hierarchy</i>

02:52.881 --> 02:54.713
<i>to financial incentives</i>

02:54.841 --> 02:56.252
<i>and more dangerously</i>

02:57.010 --> 03:00.003
<i>to the use of force or threat</i>

03:00.722 --> 03:02.554
<i>and this, of course, is called coercion.</i>

03:06.019 --> 03:08.853
As you already know,
this is a legitimate form of power

03:08.939 --> 03:11.272
it exists in every area of society

03:11.358 --> 03:15.193
not just in organisations
but also in domestic settings

03:15.278 --> 03:16.689
and more recently, of course

03:17.280 --> 03:18.280
online.

03:19.408 --> 03:21.821
Now, let's not forget the principal analogy

03:21.910 --> 03:25.745
that Bertrand Russell used to summarise
his theories on power dynamics.

03:25.872 --> 03:29.491
Just as energy is the fundamental concept
in physics...

03:29.751 --> 03:31.242
Good of you to join us, Rose.

03:32.754 --> 03:37.795
...Russell saw power as the fundamental idea
in the study of societies.

03:38.093 --> 03:40.255
As I'm sure you're all acutely aware

03:40.345 --> 03:45.761
the exam's on the 25th, so let's squeeze in
a few more revision sessions.

03:46.685 --> 03:49.052
I'll send out an email
and we'll organise it that way.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.641
You got a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

03:52.232 --> 03:55.441
Oh, and please don't forget to fill out
your student evaluation forms online

03:55.527 --> 03:57.439
by the end of the week, ideally.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.691
Thank you. Great work today.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.613
Just quickly, Harriet and I were hoping
to get in a date

04:04.661 --> 04:06.072
for your probation appraisal.

04:06.580 --> 04:10.494
Yeah, great, um... thanks.
- Maybe next Friday, 2pm?

04:10.917 --> 04:11.917
That works for me.

04:14.755 --> 04:15.755
Nerve-wracking, right?

04:16.255 --> 04:18.293
I remember that feeling.
- Yeah, well...

04:18.425 --> 04:21.463
I feel like I've been waiting
for a permanent position for so long

04:22.012 --> 04:23.378
I'm just really happy here.

04:24.473 --> 04:26.385
Well, I've not spoken to Harriet specifically

04:26.767 --> 04:28.767
but I don't think you have too much
to worry about.

04:29.561 --> 04:31.393
Not if my opinion counts for anything,
anyway.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.971
Which it may not, of course.

04:34.065 --> 04:35.931
So you might be in trouble.
- Oh, well.

04:36.318 --> 04:38.118
A little bit of trouble
never hurt anyone, eh?

04:38.153 --> 04:39.769
Well, exactly.

04:40.238 --> 04:42.104
I'll see you later.
- Yes, see you later.

04:59.341 --> 05:00.341
Leah?

05:45.178 --> 05:46.589
Oh, shit.

06:24.676 --> 06:25.757
Come in.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.753
Hi.
- Rose, hi, come in.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.589
You wanted to talk to me
about my dissertation?

06:32.309 --> 06:34.346
I do. Thank you for coming.

06:34.769 --> 06:35.769
Did you like it?

06:37.397 --> 06:39.354
It's an excellent piece of work.
- Thanks.

06:40.942 --> 06:41.942
Really means a lot.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.194
Take a seat.

06:46.990 --> 06:50.574
And of course I've read some of your
previous work from your other modules

06:50.702 --> 06:54.286
and this essay feels very different
from those

06:54.623 --> 06:56.706
in terms of content, uh...

06:57.500 --> 06:59.082
but also the style is...

07:06.009 --> 07:07.009
is different.

07:08.178 --> 07:09.178
OK.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.923
So I'm just wondering
if you've had some help with this.

07:16.227 --> 07:17.227
Rose?

07:18.605 --> 07:19.812
So you mean, did I cheat?

07:21.816 --> 07:25.651
No, I'm just wondering
if this is all your own work.

07:25.779 --> 07:26.779
Yeah.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.698
It is?
- Yeah, why wouldn't it be?

07:35.455 --> 07:39.574
And you don't often engage with the class
or contribute all that much.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.409
That is just because I'm listening to you.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.627
I find you really inspiring.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.256
Thanks.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.925
Uh, did you bring your essay notes?

07:50.345 --> 07:51.345
I forgot.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.180
You forgot?

07:53.598 --> 07:54.679
Well, I couldn't find them.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.705
You forgot or you couldn't find them?

07:57.852 --> 07:58.852
I couldn't find them.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.949
Is there something
you want to tell me, Rose?

08:02.983 --> 08:04.770
Because now would be the time.

08:06.403 --> 08:07.403
No.

08:08.863 --> 08:10.024
Thanks, though.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.858
You know, if you think I cheated

08:13.910 --> 08:15.950
I'd really appreciate
you just being honest with me.

08:16.121 --> 08:18.283
If not, you may as well
keep your opinion to yourself.

08:39.602 --> 08:40.933
Hey, Sandra.
- Hiya.

08:41.104 --> 08:43.221
I made a mistake
on the 303 dissertation marks.

08:43.273 --> 08:44.753
They haven't gone out yet, have they?

08:46.317 --> 08:47.317
You're just in time.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.029
Ta-da!
- Oh, great.

08:52.490 --> 08:53.901
Can I, um...?
- Oh, yeah.

08:55.744 --> 08:56.744
Thank you.

10:37.804 --> 10:38.804
Man!

10:39.514 --> 10:40.800
I feel rough.
- You know what?

10:40.890 --> 10:42.847
I'm actually jealous of hangovers.

10:43.434 --> 10:44.970
Late night, was it?
- Mm.

10:45.103 --> 10:46.184
Late night, early morning.

10:46.437 --> 10:47.437
Hm!
- Mm.

10:47.689 --> 10:49.225
I was walking home in heels like that.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.105
A beautiful walk of shame.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.447
Walk of glory, more like -
you should've seen him.

10:59.117 --> 11:00.824
So this girl, Rose Vaughan

11:01.494 --> 11:04.578
you know her dad's company
part-funded the new wing of the library.

11:06.249 --> 11:07.166
Really?

11:07.168 --> 11:09.250
Two hundred grand
or something stupid like that.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.294
Wow.

11:18.761 --> 11:19.761
Thanks, everyone.

11:20.346 --> 11:23.510
And as always, feel free to email me
with any thoughts

11:23.641 --> 11:24.882
problems, questions...

11:27.020 --> 11:28.020
Wow...

11:28.479 --> 11:30.345
Even by your standards, this is...

11:31.900 --> 11:32.900
pretty late.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.108
I saw the fail grade.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.941
You don't think that I'm capable
of writing that essay

11:38.990 --> 11:41.198
when actually you don't even know
what I'm capable of.

11:42.827 --> 11:46.741
All I want to do is talk it through,
ask you some questions.

11:47.749 --> 11:49.035
It's different though, isn't it?

11:49.667 --> 11:51.203
Writing something down's easy, but...

11:52.295 --> 11:54.287
saying it out loud in front of people

11:54.964 --> 11:55.964
opening yourself up.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.968
I know you feel it too. I've seen you.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.634
You get this red mark here.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.475
You spin your engagement ring
round on your finger.

12:09.520 --> 12:12.308
Take a sip of water,
trying to buy yourself a few moments.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.439
Hope that no one's noticed and...

12:15.068 --> 12:16.354
don't worry, most people don't.

12:17.862 --> 12:21.276
When you're on that podium, where all those
great people have been before you

12:22.533 --> 12:24.240
you can just hear yourself talking.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.494
You're asking that question
over and over again.

12:29.540 --> 12:30.540
What's that?

12:32.335 --> 12:33.416
Am I good enough?

12:34.712 --> 12:36.294
Do I deserve to be here?

12:39.300 --> 12:42.293
I know the answer to that question, Rose.
Do you?

12:44.055 --> 12:48.516
Or maybe I should ask your father.
He clearly cares a lot about your education.

12:49.686 --> 12:50.722
What, and yours doesn't?

12:51.271 --> 12:52.665
Do you really think it's a coincidence

12:52.689 --> 12:55.181
that you ended up teaching
at the same university as your dad?

12:57.860 --> 12:58.860
Hm.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.897
You know, you could've just paid
for a lower mark

13:02.949 --> 13:04.406
and I wouldn't have blinked an eye.

13:04.742 --> 13:06.382
Had to have the best, though, didn't you?

13:07.453 --> 13:09.570
You must have a very high opinion
of yourself.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.724
Since when was it your job
to be arbiter of all academic integrity?

13:33.813 --> 13:35.850
That's exactly her job, entirely her job.

13:35.940 --> 13:39.104
In this climate, research is all that counts.

13:39.193 --> 13:41.401
Apologies to my learned friend,
but that's bollocks.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.340
When I was there...
- Yeah, but you're not there anymore

13:43.364 --> 13:44.484
are you? Times have changed.

13:44.782 --> 13:47.115
What does Harriet say about all this?

13:47.452 --> 13:48.533
I'm meeting her later.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.578
I've asked for a judicial review.
- That's my girl.

13:52.540 --> 13:55.123
Sweetheart, sweetheart, you are so close

13:55.460 --> 13:58.419
to securing this post, don't...
don't rock the boat now.

13:58.963 --> 13:59.963
What's the point?

13:59.965 --> 14:03.082
The point is "rocking the boat"
is the entire point of her job.

14:03.301 --> 14:04.508
Yeah.
- I mean it.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.130
It's for the students' own good too.

14:07.555 --> 14:08.591
Try telling that to Rose.

14:09.390 --> 14:10.676
That's her name, is it?
- Yep.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.678
Rose Vaughan.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.928
You might've taught her last year, actually.
- Yeah, maybe.

14:16.814 --> 14:19.522
To be honest, by the end,
they all blur into one.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.401
True.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.619
Leah's always had something against me.

14:38.628 --> 14:39.664
I don't know why.

14:48.763 --> 14:51.847
Leah's always had something
against me and I don't know why.

15:12.370 --> 15:14.828
Harriet, I really don't want
to waste your time, but...

15:16.082 --> 15:17.198
I'm sorry, it's just...

15:17.708 --> 15:20.872
really upsetting when you work so hard
at something and then...

15:21.712 --> 15:23.999
you get called a liar by someone
you respect so much.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.590
I'm not calling you a liar, I just...

15:27.969 --> 15:30.006
Look, it's our responsibility

15:30.805 --> 15:33.548
to ensure that all students' work
is completely original.

15:33.808 --> 15:35.640
I know, I completely understand that, Harriet

15:35.685 --> 15:37.972
it's... it's not that.
- Well, what is it?

15:38.980 --> 15:40.221
I'm not sure I should say.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.814
Please do, it's OK.

15:45.695 --> 15:49.063
I guess I've felt like Leah's always
had something against me.

15:49.157 --> 15:50.739
I don't know why.
- What?

15:51.492 --> 15:53.028
You never ask for my opinion in class.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.280
You don't listen.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.570
You basically ignore me.
- But Rose, that's...

15:57.415 --> 16:00.203
That's because you have nothing to say,
you never contribute.

16:00.293 --> 16:03.001
You show up late, you don't engage
with what the others are saying.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.494
This isn't about the other day, is it?
You know, in the...

16:10.094 --> 16:11.734
Is there something I should know?

16:12.180 --> 16:13.180
No, no.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.180
- No.
- Can we talk in private?

16:16.934 --> 16:17.970
Sure.

16:25.276 --> 16:26.392
I'll, um...

16:26.694 --> 16:29.858
just... I'll just drop by your office later,
Harriet, if that's OK.

16:29.989 --> 16:30.989
Of course.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.617
<i>Yeah, I know she cheated anyway.</i>

16:35.703 --> 16:39.538
<i>The first time I asked her,
there was no passion, no sense of injustice.</i>

16:39.832 --> 16:42.449
Then, in front of Harriet,
she's crying her eyes out.

16:42.502 --> 16:43.502
You should've seen her.

16:45.296 --> 16:46.296
Adam?

16:49.008 --> 16:50.044
Are you listening to me?

16:51.594 --> 16:53.210
She's just a kid, who cares?

16:54.680 --> 16:55.680
I do.

16:56.974 --> 16:59.534
She's not a kid, anyway,
you should hear the way she talks to me.

16:59.769 --> 17:00.850
Oh, like what?

17:01.479 --> 17:04.722
Like, implying that I'm only a lecturer here
because of my dad.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.311
You think everyone's implying that
all of the time.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.652
As if we're all off,
having our secret little meetings.

17:10.738 --> 17:11.773
This isn't funny.

17:12.073 --> 17:13.383
I've worked really hard to get here.

17:13.406 --> 17:15.773
She's the one whose dad
built half the bloody library.

17:15.826 --> 17:16.862
Wow!

17:16.911 --> 17:18.402
You really don't like her, do you?

17:18.579 --> 17:20.662
It's not fair that she can just
get away with it

17:20.748 --> 17:22.740
and everyone else
has to work their bollocks off.

17:38.891 --> 17:39.891
Come in.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.139
Oh, sorry. I'll come back. Sorry.

17:43.271 --> 17:44.271
Why?

17:45.022 --> 17:46.022
I called you, Ben.

17:47.817 --> 17:48.817
Shut the door.

17:58.369 --> 17:59.489
You like what you see, then?

18:01.581 --> 18:03.743
Yeah, sorry, sorry...
- Don't apologise.

18:04.375 --> 18:05.866
Only weak people apologise.

18:08.129 --> 18:09.370
You're not weak, are you?

18:11.549 --> 18:13.290
No, no, I'm not.

18:15.177 --> 18:16.177
Can I rely on you?

18:17.972 --> 18:18.972
What do you mean?

18:19.807 --> 18:21.218
Can you get me Leah Dale's address?

18:22.810 --> 18:25.928
Leah Dale, sociology tutor, hmm...

18:27.607 --> 18:28.688
What do you want that for?

18:30.526 --> 18:32.233
Cos I wanna know where she fucking lives.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.156
Leah Dale's address.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.534
You can't tell anyone where you got it.

18:42.413 --> 18:44.279
It's not exactly in my job description.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.206
I'd be really grateful, Ben.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.464
Thank you.

19:02.767 --> 19:03.803
Why don't you read it?

19:04.018 --> 19:06.635
See what you think.
- No, darling, I'm working on the grant, OK?

19:06.771 --> 19:08.262
I thought you sent that in weeks ago.

19:08.522 --> 19:11.060
It's a two million pound grant, Leah,
it's five year's work.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.436
I wanna make sure we nailed it.

19:16.864 --> 19:19.744
Shall we meet at the clinic tomorrow
or do you want to go there together?

19:20.701 --> 19:21.701
Shit.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.615
I totally forgot about that.

19:25.748 --> 19:27.455
Darling, do you mind if we reschedule?

19:27.500 --> 19:28.741
This is the reschedule.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.145
What's going on with you?
- Nothing.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.910
I've just got so much on at the moment...

19:31.962 --> 19:33.669
Why would you want to reschedule again?

19:33.756 --> 19:36.436
No, I don't want to, I just...
- Do you want to have a baby with me?

19:36.842 --> 19:38.959
Oh, come on, Adam, of course I do.

19:40.388 --> 19:41.388
I do!

19:45.393 --> 19:46.393
Chuck it here, then.

19:51.565 --> 19:53.685
"Why Scandals Today
Are Seen As Pervasive Features"...

19:53.734 --> 19:54.815
oh, that thing's annoying.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.943
Oh, I know, she does it on everything,
drives me mad.

20:18.175 --> 20:19.175
So?

20:21.554 --> 20:22.554
Adam!

20:24.348 --> 20:27.182
Well, she's clearly...

20:28.185 --> 20:29.847
a genius.
- Oi!

20:34.442 --> 20:35.562
Wait till you see her essays

20:35.651 --> 20:37.813
from her other modules.
- Bring it on.

21:47.264 --> 21:48.264
Hmm.

21:49.558 --> 21:51.515
Who was it?
- No one.

21:53.813 --> 21:54.849
Probably kids.

21:56.065 --> 21:57.351
The little fuckers.

22:33.310 --> 22:34.551
You coming for a drink?

22:35.563 --> 22:37.850
No, gotta get up early tomorrow.

22:37.982 --> 22:39.974
Come on, everyone's going.

22:40.484 --> 22:41.484
I'm good, thanks.

22:42.027 --> 22:46.021
You are still not convinced
that we got the right one.

22:46.615 --> 22:47.615
Are you?

22:49.577 --> 22:50.863
They both look so innocent.

22:55.332 --> 22:56.332
OK, so...

22:57.751 --> 22:58.867
how shall we do this?

23:00.963 --> 23:02.329
Well, we've got a half an hour.

23:03.257 --> 23:04.498
What do you want to talk about?

23:07.177 --> 23:08.177
Adam.

23:17.980 --> 23:19.266
So sorry...
- Uh, it's fine.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.936
We booked a double session,
so there's plenty of time.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.481
So, we've had the tests

23:25.696 --> 23:29.531
and I'm afraid to say
there are some abnormal cells.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.404
Now, this isn't the end of the road
by any means.

23:32.661 --> 23:34.493
I'd like to book another appointment

23:34.788 --> 23:37.246
to go through all your IVF options properly.

23:39.043 --> 23:40.043
Right.

23:42.796 --> 23:44.412
It's OK, love, we'll get you through it.

23:45.966 --> 23:48.800
Oh, uh, I'm sorry, Mr Dale,
I haven't been clear.

23:49.345 --> 23:52.964
It's not Leah's results
that we have to think about.

24:03.901 --> 24:06.439
I don't think I've got time
to drop you at work now, I'm sorry.

24:07.780 --> 24:08.780
You said you would.

24:09.823 --> 24:11.985
Yeah, I didn't know how long
it was gonna take, did I?

24:12.034 --> 24:14.474
I've got a lecture in five minutes,
what do you want me to do?

24:15.371 --> 24:16.578
It's OK, I'll walk.

24:20.376 --> 24:21.537
We don't need to get angry.

24:21.669 --> 24:22.669
I'm not angry.

24:25.381 --> 24:27.168
You sound angry.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.050
For God's sake.

24:34.765 --> 24:35.926
It's going to be OK.

24:37.851 --> 24:39.012
Yeah, for you, maybe.

24:40.187 --> 24:41.347
What's that supposed to mean?

24:44.525 --> 24:45.525
What?

24:46.652 --> 24:47.688
No, come on. What?

24:48.821 --> 24:50.215
Well, it's worked out nicely for you,
hasn't it?

24:50.239 --> 24:52.039
You never even wanted kids
in the first place.

25:00.958 --> 25:01.958
Leah...

25:02.668 --> 25:03.704
I'm sorry.

25:08.215 --> 25:09.215
Leah.

25:09.299 --> 25:10.318
Leah!

25:10.342 --> 25:11.549
- Come on!
- Shut up!

25:21.603 --> 25:22.603
Leah!

25:23.689 --> 25:25.271
Leah!

25:25.315 --> 25:26.475
- Come on!
- Alright!

25:34.324 --> 25:35.324
Hiya.

26:18.535 --> 26:20.697
...gave rise to capitalism as we know it

26:20.996 --> 26:23.409
because wealth was a sign of God's favour

26:23.499 --> 26:25.582
that we were on the path to salvation.

26:25.959 --> 26:26.959
Thank you, Ellie.

26:30.297 --> 26:32.129
You disagree with that idea, Rose?

26:34.593 --> 26:36.233
Or at least you did in your dissertation.

26:38.347 --> 26:39.508
Well, it's, um...

26:40.015 --> 26:41.096
it's complicated, I guess.

26:42.184 --> 26:43.595
Not according to your argument.

26:44.394 --> 26:47.262
Why don't you explain it to us,
just briefly?

26:48.065 --> 26:50.352
Sorry, Ellie. Do you mind just repeating
what you sai...

26:50.400 --> 26:51.732
You mean you weren't listening?

26:53.112 --> 26:54.631
- All I was saying...
- Tell you what.

26:54.655 --> 26:56.575
Why don't I read it out for you?
Would that help?

26:56.740 --> 26:58.447
- I'd rather you didn't.
- Here it is.

27:00.828 --> 27:05.038
"It is awfully generous of Veber to credit
humanity's voracious pursuit of profit

27:05.124 --> 27:07.707
to a quest for spiritual
and religious redemption."

27:09.044 --> 27:10.831
Yeah, it's exciting stuff.

27:12.089 --> 27:13.876
You sure you can't shed any more light?

27:16.301 --> 27:18.463
I mean... you haven't changed your mind
or anything?

27:18.512 --> 27:19.628
You stand by what you said?

27:20.097 --> 27:21.097
Of course.

27:22.224 --> 27:23.224
Interesting.

27:24.685 --> 27:26.267
Cos this isn't your essay at all.

27:26.311 --> 27:28.098
This is a student from last year.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.235
Excuse me, everyone.
- Sit down, you're not excused.

27:35.946 --> 27:37.278
I said, sit down.

27:52.963 --> 27:53.963
So...

27:55.591 --> 27:57.674
I don't like talking in class
and I've told you that.

27:58.343 --> 27:59.343
Right.

28:04.474 --> 28:07.074
Does anyone else have any ideas
they want to share with the class?

28:07.352 --> 28:08.352
Yes.
- Yes.

28:08.854 --> 28:11.688
Uh, I just wanted
to pop back to what Ellie was saying...

28:21.992 --> 28:23.324
Leah.
- Yes?

28:24.411 --> 28:26.051
That was really cruel, what you just did.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.474
I don't know what you're doing, Rose

28:28.498 --> 28:30.578
but if you think you can intimidate me,
you're wrong.

28:45.849 --> 28:47.636
- There you go.
- Thanks.

28:47.684 --> 28:49.425
Gin and tonic.

28:49.728 --> 28:50.844
Ooh, here he is!

28:54.149 --> 28:56.516
So, he wants to see me again.

28:57.486 --> 28:59.068
He's keen, what are you gonna say?

28:59.154 --> 29:01.237
Um, nothing, for at least seven minutes.

29:01.531 --> 29:02.692
Play it cool.
- Yeah.

29:03.325 --> 29:04.907
- Cheers.
- Ah!

29:05.827 --> 29:07.159
Thank you.
- Mm.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.116
Don't be silly.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.368
How you feeling about it?
- Strange.

29:12.501 --> 29:14.788
Having a baby is all we've thought about
for so long

29:14.878 --> 29:17.370
and just like that,
you find out you can't.

29:18.465 --> 29:20.225
There are other options though,
aren't there?

29:20.259 --> 29:21.259
Yeah.

29:22.135 --> 29:23.135
What?

29:23.512 --> 29:26.241
I was just thinking, I can't remember
the last time we had sex for fun

29:26.265 --> 29:28.348
without consulting
that bloody schedule first.

29:30.686 --> 29:32.247
Having said that,
I can't remember the last time

29:32.271 --> 29:33.539
he made me a cup of tea, either.

29:33.563 --> 29:35.930
Or came to greet me at the door
when I came home from work.

29:37.859 --> 29:39.600
OK, here's the thing.

29:40.737 --> 29:44.276
Sometimes I think we're one of those couples
who stay together for the sake of the kids

29:44.700 --> 29:46.191
and we haven't even bloody got one!

29:47.077 --> 29:48.613
It's ridiculous!

29:51.081 --> 29:53.619
Maybe he's got a point though,
maybe I am a little bit relieved.

29:54.251 --> 29:56.083
Maybe.

29:58.422 --> 29:59.422
Don't you dare.

30:04.970 --> 30:06.239
<i>Hi, this is Leah Dale.</i>

30:06.263 --> 30:08.255
<i>I can't get to the phone right now
so you...</i>

30:11.685 --> 30:12.801
Cheers!

30:17.024 --> 30:18.140
To Rose Vaughan.

30:19.651 --> 30:22.143
You're still pushing that, are you?
- Yes, I am.

30:23.405 --> 30:26.398
What is the point in anything
if we all just cheat our way to the top?

30:26.491 --> 30:27.491
It doesn't help anyone.

30:28.201 --> 30:30.430
Every time I turn on the news,
that's all I see these days

30:30.454 --> 30:32.320
bloody liars and cheats everywhere

30:32.414 --> 30:34.656
running the country, the economy,
and I'm sick of it.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.477
And this is gonna change all that, is it?

30:36.501 --> 30:38.663
Absolutely not, no.

30:41.923 --> 30:45.087
Well, in my little section of the world,
in my tiny compartment

30:45.135 --> 30:47.095
I'm gonna make sure
that things are done properly.

30:48.430 --> 30:49.430
Plus, you know what?

30:49.973 --> 30:50.973
She's really annoying.

30:53.226 --> 30:54.683
Oh, stop it!

30:55.395 --> 30:56.395
Oh, let's have a look.

30:56.938 --> 30:58.019
Come on!

30:58.190 --> 30:59.772
Oh, you're such a tease!

31:00.233 --> 31:02.816
Just share with me!

31:28.887 --> 31:30.719
Hi, um... is Leah in?

31:31.306 --> 31:34.094
Uh... no, sorry. Can I take a message?

31:34.559 --> 31:35.559
Can I...

31:37.938 --> 31:39.145
Yeah, come in, come in.

31:40.065 --> 31:41.065
Thanks.

31:43.276 --> 31:45.893
I'm Rose, it's just my essay notes.
- Oh, right.

31:46.863 --> 31:48.320
Has she mentioned it at all?
- Uh...

31:48.907 --> 31:49.907
briefly.

31:53.495 --> 31:55.782
Um... uh, here.

31:56.915 --> 31:57.915
Thanks.

32:05.298 --> 32:06.880
Can I get you a cup of tea?

32:08.260 --> 32:09.740
I'll have a whisky if you've got one.

32:13.640 --> 32:16.053
- Tea's fine, I will...
- No, no!

32:16.810 --> 32:19.018
It's OK, I'm sure I can rustle something up.

32:19.271 --> 32:20.387
Come on through.

32:21.440 --> 32:22.476
Leah will be back soon.

32:22.524 --> 32:25.608
I'm just not sure exactly when,
unfortunately.

32:25.861 --> 32:27.727
Hello there.

32:29.906 --> 32:33.490
Sorry, I don't mean to impose, it's just nice
to be out of the rain for a bit.

32:33.577 --> 32:34.613
No, not at all.

32:35.370 --> 32:37.578
Do you want ice with that?
- No, straight up.

32:44.921 --> 32:45.921
Fuck me!

32:48.467 --> 32:50.083
I can't usually afford the good stuff.

32:50.427 --> 32:52.267
Well, I don't get much of a chance
to share it.

32:53.096 --> 32:54.382
Leah's more of a...

32:55.015 --> 32:57.507
vodka girl, really.
- I love Leah.

32:58.643 --> 33:00.475
She's such an inspiring lecturer.

33:01.396 --> 33:03.036
She must have picked up so much from you.

33:06.109 --> 33:08.021
Well, I'd love to take the credit but, um...

33:08.904 --> 33:11.817
her father's mostly to blame,
she gets it all from him.

33:12.365 --> 33:15.324
I don't know.
I was in some of his classes last year.

33:16.703 --> 33:19.446
I'd say she's got all of his skill
but none of his ego.

33:20.373 --> 33:22.160
Makes her the better teacher, if you ask me.

33:22.876 --> 33:25.396
Don't you think a certain amount of ego
is required for the job?

33:26.004 --> 33:28.087
There's a difference between
confidence and ego.

33:35.096 --> 33:36.928
One of my friends is in one of your classes.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.469
She says it's her favourite.

33:39.309 --> 33:40.675
She looks forward to it the most.

33:40.977 --> 33:41.977
Really? What's her name?

33:42.979 --> 33:44.140
I shouldn't say.

33:44.731 --> 33:45.972
She'd be embarrassed.

33:47.025 --> 33:50.609
Well, it's very nice of her to say.

33:55.951 --> 33:57.533
Do you think I cheated, Dr Dale?

33:57.994 --> 33:58.994
It's Adam.

33:59.412 --> 34:02.029
And... I couldn't care less.

34:04.709 --> 34:05.950
Leah seems to care.

34:06.461 --> 34:08.043
Well, she cares about a lot of things.

34:08.170 --> 34:09.378
Yeah, I'll drink to that.

34:23.562 --> 34:24.562
Shit!

34:31.570 --> 34:32.570
Oh!

34:39.202 --> 34:40.818
You off?
- Yeah.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.286
Thanks for the drink.

34:43.581 --> 34:44.581
Rose?

34:45.417 --> 34:46.417
Don't worry.

34:46.835 --> 34:48.475
I'm sure we'll sort this whole thing out.

34:48.628 --> 34:49.628
Hope so.

35:07.606 --> 35:08.606
Morning.

35:09.149 --> 35:11.232
Hey.
- Didn't hear you come in last night.

35:11.860 --> 35:13.647
No, I was out with Amy.

35:16.489 --> 35:19.232
I... I really am sorry about what I said.

35:19.701 --> 35:21.301
I think it was just the shock of it all.

35:21.828 --> 35:23.588
I'm still trying to process it,
to be honest.

35:25.206 --> 35:26.206
Yeah.

35:27.250 --> 35:28.286
I'm sorry too.

35:31.671 --> 35:35.631
I do realise how hard it must have been
for you while we've been trying

35:35.717 --> 35:37.709
and I'm aware that I've put pressure on you.

35:38.053 --> 35:40.466
I just want you to know that I'm grateful.

35:44.726 --> 35:48.845
Let's go to the cafe before work,
hangover special, my treat.

35:50.815 --> 35:51.815
That'd be lovely.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.151
Oh, uh...

35:54.611 --> 35:57.854
Rose Vaughan dropped these off last night,
the notes you wanted.

35:58.615 --> 35:59.856
Here... she came here?

36:00.367 --> 36:02.108
Mm.
- How did she know where we live?

36:03.203 --> 36:05.083
Everyone knows where everyone lives
around here.

36:05.872 --> 36:06.872
Do they?

36:20.762 --> 36:21.923
Alright, Rose?

36:23.765 --> 36:25.805
Sorry to disturb,
I just thought I'd bring you this.

36:26.267 --> 36:27.453
It's the one I talked to you about.

36:27.477 --> 36:29.309
You said you liked it, so I thought,
y'know...

36:32.148 --> 36:33.148
Right.

36:33.483 --> 36:34.483
And uh...

36:35.193 --> 36:36.855
you know that other thing you asked for?

36:37.404 --> 36:39.817
If you're really sure, Rose,
I'll sort it for you.

36:41.157 --> 36:42.157
Thanks, Ben.

36:42.992 --> 36:44.028
I appreciate it.

36:46.162 --> 36:47.162
Alright.

36:47.414 --> 36:49.781
I've kind of got work that I need to do.

36:50.250 --> 36:52.458
Oh, yeah, yeah. Course you have.

36:52.919 --> 36:54.785
See you later. Don't work too hard.

37:02.846 --> 37:04.178
Did you give her whisky?

37:05.140 --> 37:06.140
Hm?

37:08.143 --> 37:09.143
Rose, last night?

37:11.604 --> 37:13.436
Well, I offered her tea.
She asked for whisky.

37:14.315 --> 37:15.315
What?

37:18.820 --> 37:20.548
You know, for what it's worth,
she's a nice girl

37:20.572 --> 37:22.063
she's very smart.

37:30.290 --> 37:31.326
Betsy!

37:34.961 --> 37:35.961
Betsy!

37:40.425 --> 37:44.590
Those books you rang for,
that's the first one and that's these two.

37:44.888 --> 37:46.129
Thanks.
- Thanks.

38:35.271 --> 38:37.231
Since when have you been
taking those again?

38:38.441 --> 38:39.557
Since now.

38:40.985 --> 38:41.985
So...

38:42.320 --> 38:44.733
what does that mean?
- It doesn't mean anything.

38:48.743 --> 38:51.076
Look, Leah...
- Get off me, please.

38:51.204 --> 38:53.412
Have you any idea
how hard this is for me?

38:55.917 --> 38:57.436
I might not be able to give you a baby.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.230
Does that even bother you?
Because it bothers me.

38:59.254 --> 39:02.292
Yeah, yeah. It bothers me.
Of course it bothers me, God...

39:04.968 --> 39:06.129
So can we...

39:06.928 --> 39:08.294
can we talk about our options?

39:09.138 --> 39:10.138
Oh...

39:11.599 --> 39:14.763
Or is that it, we just... stop trying?

39:18.231 --> 39:20.268
Tell me what you want, Leah.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.276
To sleep.

39:28.616 --> 39:29.857
I just want to sleep.

39:32.912 --> 39:34.949
And I want to find my bloody cat.

39:36.541 --> 39:38.578
Betsy!

39:38.710 --> 39:40.542
She'll come when she's ready.

39:40.962 --> 39:42.453
Do you think this is a coincidence?

39:42.547 --> 39:44.288
What?
- Rose comes to our house

39:44.340 --> 39:46.707
and the next day our cat goes missing.

39:46.759 --> 39:48.250
Come on, will you listen to yourself?

39:48.595 --> 39:50.406
Why did she come here?
It doesn't make any sense.

39:50.430 --> 39:53.093
You wanted her to be more eager,
show more commitment.

39:53.141 --> 39:54.618
You don't show commitment by showing up

39:54.642 --> 39:56.682
at your lecturer's house
in the middle of the night.

39:56.853 --> 39:58.845
Betsy!
- Will you stop shouting?

39:58.938 --> 40:01.225
Well, where is she then?
- It's midnight.

40:01.983 --> 40:02.983
She's a cat.

40:04.986 --> 40:05.986
Leah...

40:06.279 --> 40:07.279
Leah!

40:10.742 --> 40:13.359
If you really want to find her,
she is chipped, you know.

40:16.497 --> 40:17.497
Is she there?

40:18.499 --> 40:19.499
She...

40:20.043 --> 40:21.043
Yeah.

40:21.711 --> 40:23.919
No, no, she's fine.
She's round the front.

40:27.926 --> 40:30.168
Betsy!

40:30.845 --> 40:32.711
Uh... should be just here on the right.

40:37.101 --> 40:38.342
In the bushes somewhere here.

40:41.898 --> 40:42.979
Oh...

40:45.526 --> 40:46.812
Oh, God...

40:52.075 --> 40:53.441
I'm sorry, love.

41:10.009 --> 41:12.649
How many times have I said
we should have speed bumps on this road?

41:13.554 --> 41:14.761
Thank God it wasn't a child.

41:18.142 --> 41:20.702
I'll go round the neighbours' tomorrow,
see if they saw anything.

41:22.605 --> 41:23.721
Where was her collar?

41:24.482 --> 41:25.357
Hm?

41:25.359 --> 41:27.238
She didn't have her collar on
when we found her.

41:28.194 --> 41:30.527
Probably came off when the car hit her.

41:31.197 --> 41:32.233
How would that work?

41:36.035 --> 41:37.151
Why does it matter?

41:38.162 --> 41:39.162
It doesn't.

41:40.873 --> 41:42.364
It's just strange, that's all.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.461
You want a cup of tea?
- Yeah.

42:10.528 --> 42:11.735
Can I have a word, Rose?

42:13.281 --> 42:14.281
What's up?

42:15.033 --> 42:17.696
I want to apologise
for what happened in class the other day.

42:17.744 --> 42:20.077
It wasn't fair for me
to put you on the spot like that.

42:21.205 --> 42:22.787
OK, thanks.

42:23.041 --> 42:25.158
Bit of a stressful time for me at the moment

42:25.918 --> 42:27.329
with work, and, uh...

42:29.130 --> 42:31.543
last night our cat died.
- Oh, my God.

42:32.842 --> 42:34.128
I'm so sorry, what happened?

42:34.761 --> 42:35.842
We don't know.

42:37.180 --> 42:39.718
Car, maybe.
- You must be devastated.

42:40.224 --> 42:41.224
Yeah.

42:43.186 --> 42:44.222
Poor Betsy.

42:47.690 --> 42:48.690
Right.

43:06.209 --> 43:07.450
You don't miss him, do you?

43:26.437 --> 43:27.437
It's OK.

43:28.898 --> 43:30.105
You can't help how you feel.

43:33.027 --> 43:35.506
It's amazing how quickly
you can adjust to life without someone

43:35.530 --> 43:37.490
if you never really loved them
in the first place.

43:38.658 --> 43:40.524
You don't know what you're talking about.

43:50.419 --> 43:51.455
Tell me, Leah.

43:52.004 --> 43:53.040
Do you feel guilty?
