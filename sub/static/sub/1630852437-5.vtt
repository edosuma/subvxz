You know, I figured,
with your disposition,

39:24.416 --> 39:26.541
you'd wanna forgo the astromech.

40:03.208 --> 40:04.750
Ready as she'll ever be.

40:08.125 --> 40:09.125
Start her up.

-Yeah, start her up.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.166

40:53.250 --> 40:57.625

but she's a starfighter.

41:38.458 --> 41:39.916
So fly her like one.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.875
Okay. I'll open her up.

41:44.166 --> 41:46.375

43:57.666 --> 44:01.666
You're also operating without a beacon.
I'm gonna need you to run one for us.

44:02.416 --> 44:05.208
Sorry, officer,
I got a little carried away there.

44:05.291 --> 44:06.375
Transmitting now.

44:07.750 --> 44:08.750
Hmm.

44:09.708 --> 44:12.291
Your engine model
doesn't match your power drive.

44:12.375 --> 44:15.500
We just built her.
I was taking her up for a test flight.

Haven't been able to update
the registration just yet.

Yeah, sorry, officer,
but my transmitter isn't hooked up yet.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.666
I'll head right back to Mos Eisley
and get it sorted out.

Your voice is mighty familiar.
Did you used to fly a Razor Crest?

I think you have the wrong guy, officer.

44:55.875 --> 44:59.708

You mind answering a few questions?

45:19.333 --> 45:22.541
How did it jump?
He didn't power up his hyperdrives.

45:22.625 --> 45:25.958
Didn't jump, kid.
Those were his sublight thrusters.

Don't worry.
I told her I didn't know where you were.

46:11.916 --> 46:15.291
Then I locked her out
and engaged the hangar security system.

46:15.375 --> 46:16.833
She tell you her name?

46:16.916 --> 46:18.125
-Fennec Shand.
