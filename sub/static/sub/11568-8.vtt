WEBVTT

00:08.208 --> 00:10.809
Hmm. Oh, oh!
Do you think that's him?

00:10.811 --> 00:12.211
-Where?
-Right there.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.813
That guy, the only
person here.

00:14.815 --> 00:18.350
Then, yeah,
I think that's him.
Hi, David!

00:18.352 --> 00:20.419
Hi. Yes. Hi, hi. Hi. Uh...

00:20.421 --> 00:23.956
As I said in my note,
I lost my wedding ring.
It's... It's here somewhere.

00:23.958 --> 00:26.325
I was playing softball.
It's getting dark
and we have to find it

00:26.327 --> 00:28.427
because my wife is
gonna kill me
if I don't, uh...

00:28.429 --> 00:30.629
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Before we get started, man,

00:30.631 --> 00:33.432
we're gonna need you
to fill out some
paperwork, okay?

00:33.434 --> 00:34.933
Oh, shit.
I forgot the paperwork.

00:34.935 --> 00:37.369
-I think I got it in my van.
-Wait, can we just...

00:42.776 --> 00:45.444
(PAPERS RUSTLING)

00:45.446 --> 00:47.646
Can we just start looking?
The sun's going down.

00:47.648 --> 00:48.714
Here you go, David.

00:50.016 --> 00:51.116
Why do you need
my height and weight?

00:51.118 --> 00:53.419
It's just standard.

00:53.421 --> 00:55.087
What is this? Why do you
need to know my hobbies?

00:55.089 --> 00:57.890
Oh, that's for
target emailing.
You can skip that,

00:57.892 --> 00:59.792
or just put "ice skating".

00:59.794 --> 01:02.895
My yearly income? What...
What does that have
to do with anything?

01:02.897 --> 01:04.797
Oh, just simple curiosity.

01:06.833 --> 01:08.100
Uh...

01:10.203 --> 01:13.138
Here. I could only
remember the address of the
last two places I lived.

01:13.140 --> 01:16.008
Okay. This all
looks to be in order.

01:16.010 --> 01:18.243
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You don't want our newsletter?

01:18.245 --> 01:19.745
No, I don't want a newsletter.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.180
Are you sure?

01:21.182 --> 01:23.248
Because it's chock-full
of tips and tit-bits.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.150
Information, riddles.

01:25.152 --> 01:27.553
-Fine.
-You just gotta
check this box.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.555
Okay. Let's start
looking for that ring.

01:29.557 --> 01:31.390
Now, what this wedding
ring got on it?

01:31.392 --> 01:34.460
Emeralds? Rubies?
A bunch of sapphires?

01:34.462 --> 01:37.596
Encrusted with a bunch
of like... Emeralds?

01:37.598 --> 01:40.432
What? No. It's...
It's just a plain gold band.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.568
Really?
With this yearly salary?

01:42.570 --> 01:44.369
You gotta treat
yourself, David!

01:44.371 --> 01:46.939
You can't spend all this money
when you're dead.

01:46.941 --> 01:50.576
Well, I'm gonna be dead
if I can't find my wedding
ring, so can we please,

01:50.578 --> 01:53.512
-please start looking?
-I don't know. Can we, David?

01:53.514 --> 01:56.482
I think you mean,
may we start looking?

01:56.484 --> 01:59.718
(CHUCKLES) Oh, my God.
This is great.

02:02.522 --> 02:03.989
(HUMMING)

02:03.991 --> 02:05.257
(GASPS) Ahhh!

02:07.093 --> 02:09.261
Make a wish...

02:09.263 --> 02:11.463
(CHUCKLES) Ah,
this is a nice mystery.

02:11.465 --> 02:15.033
An outdoors one.
Get a little sun, vitamin D.

02:15.035 --> 02:17.202
(SIGHS)
Oh, I played field hockey.

02:17.204 --> 02:19.371
Did I ever tell you that?
I was a sweeper.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.640
Yeah. We were
the Knight's Bridge Owls.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.877
Ah, we were good.
We weren't great, but we
were good. (CHUCKLES)

02:24.879 --> 02:28.547
But the stories
I could tell... (CHUCKLES)

02:28.549 --> 02:30.349
One night, we got all
of our clothes...

02:30.351 --> 02:31.450
-PIGEON: Found it.
-Where?

02:31.452 --> 02:33.085
PIGEON: Found it, guys.

02:33.087 --> 02:34.653
Oh, thank God. Really?

02:35.288 --> 02:36.889
No. (LAUGHS)

02:37.524 --> 02:38.524
(CRIES)

02:38.526 --> 02:40.726
Oh, jeez.
Nobody gets my humor.

02:40.728 --> 02:44.062
(SOBBING) Forget it,
forget it, we're never
gonna find it.

02:44.064 --> 02:47.766
I'm dead. I am dead.
I'm a dead man.
Elizabeth is gonna kill me.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.434
Well, I'm sure
she'll understand.

02:49.436 --> 02:51.003
You don't know my wife!

02:51.005 --> 02:53.472
I know your wife. (LAUGHS)

02:53.474 --> 02:55.607
Because I (BLEEP) her.
Right in the rear.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.976
-My God.
-Oh, come on, it's a joke.

02:57.978 --> 03:00.512
In what world? In what world?

03:04.784 --> 03:06.118
(ENGINE STOPS)

03:06.120 --> 03:08.921
I just... I...
I can't go in there.

03:09.789 --> 03:11.456
I am so scared.

03:11.458 --> 03:15.160
David, this is your wife,
your partner.
She's gonna understand.

03:15.162 --> 03:19.264
A marriage needs to be
able to withstand life's
little disappointments.

03:19.266 --> 03:23.535
People make mistakes.
You're not perfect.
You're human.

03:23.537 --> 03:26.672
You're right. You're right.
No, I, argh...

03:26.674 --> 03:29.174
I just got myself so wound up.
(CHUCKLING)

03:29.176 --> 03:31.410
(EXHALING)

03:31.412 --> 03:34.413
Thank you. I'm really glad
that I wrote to you guys.

03:35.081 --> 03:36.648
(DOOR CLOSES)

03:36.650 --> 03:39.785
And I'm looking
forward to getting
the newsletter! (LAUGHS)

03:41.821 --> 03:43.689
What? (GASPS) His ring!

03:43.691 --> 03:46.658
Ah! It must've been
in his pocket the whole time.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.760
Oh, my God.
What a (BLEEP) idiot.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.532
What are you doing?
Go, give him his ring!

03:53.534 --> 03:55.167
DAVID: Elizabeth...

03:55.169 --> 03:57.169
Hmm. No, no!

03:57.171 --> 04:00.706
You know what? (CLEARS THROAT)
This is a teachable
moment for David. Hmm?

04:00.708 --> 04:02.708
He has to learn that
disappointment

04:02.710 --> 04:04.443
will not bring about
the end of a rela...

04:04.445 --> 04:05.978
-(GUNSHOT)
-(GASPS)

04:05.980 --> 04:07.346
Hmm.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.248
Sure sounds like
the end of a relationship.

04:09.949 --> 04:11.483
(GUNSHOTS CONTINUE)

04:12.919 --> 04:14.820
(PANTING)

04:20.093 --> 04:21.460
(TIRES SCREECHING)

04:25.431 --> 04:27.132
Well, let's get outta here.

04:27.134 --> 04:30.702
Did that mystery. And let's
just get on to the next one.

04:38.177 --> 04:40.012
Okay. Out with the old,
in with the new.

04:40.014 --> 04:42.814
-Dad, we witnessed a murder.
-"Dear Mike Tyson
Mystery team..."

04:42.816 --> 04:44.883
-Dad...
-Damn, it's too dark out here.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.151
Let's go inside.

04:46.153 --> 04:47.753
(SIGHING)

04:47.755 --> 04:50.822
Oh, I just can't shake
this awful feeling that

04:50.824 --> 04:53.959
I somehow led this man
to his death.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.460
Well, you did. I mean,

04:55.462 --> 04:57.029
he said, "My wife's
gonna kill me," and you said,

04:57.031 --> 04:59.798
"No, she's not. Go inside,"
and she shot him,

04:59.800 --> 05:00.932
several times.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.235
I bet you could be held
criminally responsible.

05:03.237 --> 05:05.704
I mean, I'm not a lawyer,
but I bet you could go
to prison for a long time,

05:05.706 --> 05:07.072
-or be put to death.
-(GASPS)

05:07.074 --> 05:08.874
We got that death penalty
here in Nevada?

05:08.876 --> 05:10.075
I... I think we do.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.910
They're gonna give you
that lethal cocktail.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.079
It never works.
You'll be writhing around.

05:14.081 --> 05:16.581
(BLEEP) This is bad, Marquess.
This is really bad.

05:16.583 --> 05:19.051
What? We were all there.
This isn't my fault.

05:19.053 --> 05:21.787
(GASPS) Oh, God.
I still have his ring.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.789
I have to get rid
of this evidence.

05:24.123 --> 05:25.390
(GRUNTS)

05:30.063 --> 05:33.131

That's not gonna work.

05:41.475 --> 05:43.709
I've gotta put it someplace
no one can find it.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.110
You're not gonna
see me for a while.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.678
Don't try to contact me.

05:49.282 --> 05:50.549
Okie-doke!

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.124
None of this would be
happening if I had just

05:59.126 --> 06:03.328
given him the (BLEEP) ring,
Marquess. Just give him
the (BLEEP) ring.

06:03.330 --> 06:05.297
They're not gonna let me walk.

06:05.299 --> 06:07.966
I'm an accessory to murder.
I don't even (BLEEP)
know what that means.

(GASPS) Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Yes!

06:13.474 --> 06:18.009
I'll throw it into a vat
of molten lava and be
done with all of it.

How does he drive this thing?

06:23.984 --> 06:26.985
It's all blind spots.
It's like driving
a living room.

06:50.276 --> 06:51.543
What? (GASPS)

06:54.046 --> 06:56.415
Is that... David's wife?

07:00.620 --> 07:03.889
(GASPS) She's getting
rid of the murder weapon.

07:03.891 --> 07:06.525

wanna die, either.

just go under and stop.

Michael, absolutely.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.557
I'm just gonna tell them
what happened.

08:12.559 --> 08:14.493
I have no regrets
about what I did,

08:14.495 --> 08:18.263
and I think, if it comes
to it, a jury of my peers
will exonerate me.

<i>I was nervous, but I really</i>
<i>took to heart what you said,</i>

<i>so I just told her the truth.</i>
<i>I said, "Elizabeth,</i>
<i>I lost my wedding ring."</i>

09:01.808 --> 09:05.410
<i>She flipped out.</i>
<i>She ripped open a drawer</i>
<i>and she took out her gun,</i>

<i>and fired and she missed.</i>

<i>I saw something.</i>

<i>I saw something</i>

<i>Love.</i>

<i>Regret, shame.</i>

<i>She pointed the gun at</i>

it hasn't been enough time.

I'm overreacting.
