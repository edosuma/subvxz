00:08.447 --> 00:11.019
Our topic today has been honesty.

00:11.198 --> 00:15.443
The courage to face each other
with the plain truth.

00:15.617 --> 00:17.692
I've certainly enjoyed myself
these last few hours.

00:17.868 --> 00:19.278
I hope you have too.

00:19.452 --> 00:24.444
This is Dr. Frasier Crane
wishing you good mental health.

00:25.580 --> 00:27.904
Well, that was a dog of a show.

00:29.457 --> 00:31.247
They all blend.

00:31.416 --> 00:35.626
Oh, you got a message.
A Blaine Sternin called.

00:36.919 --> 00:38.163
Blaine Sternin.

00:39.170 --> 00:41.541
Call him back, tell him I'm dead.

00:42.880 --> 00:45.204
Sternin. Is he related to Lilith?

00:45.381 --> 00:49.211
Yes. He's Lilith's half brother,
the curse of the family.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.955
What does it say
when Lilith is the good one?

00:52.134 --> 00:53.758
He sounded charming on the phone.

00:53.927 --> 00:56.084
Well, of course
he sounded charming.

00:56.261 --> 01:01.134
Charm is the viscous grease with
which he oils his flimflam machine.

01:01.305 --> 01:03.297
The man will say anything
to get what he wants.

01:03.473 --> 01:06.508
I can't believe
I haven't dated this guy.

01:06.683 --> 01:09.599
The only reason he'd be contacting me
is to separate me from my money.

01:09.768 --> 01:12.340
The man is always coming up
with some... Some sucker sob story

01:12.519 --> 01:14.973
while he's busy living the highlife
in Laughlin, Nevada.

01:17.146 --> 01:19.636
You know, he once stole from me
a very precious antique.

01:19.814 --> 01:22.386
My 18th-century English salt server.

01:22.565 --> 01:26.775
Well, if you don't mind Elvis,
you can have mine.

01:27.818 --> 01:30.438
- Oh, dear God.
ROZ: What?

01:31.153 --> 01:34.851
This number he left. It's local.

01:37.698 --> 01:40.483
The beast walks among us.

01:47.702 --> 01:49.694

the front door or the phone.

Blaine Sternin is in Seattle.

01:55.790 --> 01:58.160
- Who?
- Lilith's half brother.

01:58.332 --> 02:01.616
Is he the scoundrel that walked off
with your 18th-century saltcellar?

02:01.792 --> 02:03.583
The very same.

02:03.752 --> 02:07.249
Blaine Sternin. A package came
for you this afternoon.

02:07.420 --> 02:10.585
I believe that was the name
on the return address.

02:10.963 --> 02:13.002
What could he possibly
be sending me?

02:13.881 --> 02:16.371
Daphne, you've got longer nails
than I have.

02:16.549 --> 02:18.588
Open it yourself.

02:18.759 --> 02:20.667
All right.

02:24.720 --> 02:26.676
Well, what do you know?

02:29.556 --> 02:31.761
It's my salt server.

I've got turnips growing out of my ears.

Maybe he wants to make amends.

This is a man who once made a living

It's hard to believe a man
of your intellect could be so fooled.

04:16.606 --> 04:19.559
It wasn't my intellect
that he preyed upon, Daphne.

04:19.733 --> 04:23.230
It was my kind and generous heart.

Hello, Blaine.

04:47.454 --> 04:50.026
Well, the truth is,
I've been in a terrible accident.

04:50.206 --> 04:53.121
I've lost feeling from my waist down.
Doctors tell me I'll be like this

04:53.290 --> 04:55.827

05:02.795 --> 05:05.580
Bravo, Blaine.
This is the best one yet.

05:05.755 --> 05:09.204
But you forget with whom
you are dealing. I've seen it all.

05:09.381 --> 05:11.705
Dr. Crane,
the man is in a wheelchair.

05:11.882 --> 05:16.756
Which means that somewhere,
someone is missing a wheelchair.

05:18.386 --> 05:21.255
Frasier, if you don't believe him,
why don't you call Lilith?

05:22.554 --> 05:23.834
Good idea.

05:25.097 --> 05:27.587
So, Martin, I see you also
park in the blue zone.

05:27.765 --> 05:31.049
Yeah, when I can.
But those spaces are always filled.

05:31.225 --> 05:33.051
Yeah, well,
that's probably partly my fault.

05:33.226 --> 05:37.138
Boy, I sold a lot of fake
handicapped plates in my time.

05:37.645 --> 05:40.644
Boy, talk about a butt-load
of poetic justice, huh?

05:40.813 --> 05:44.061
Yes, I believe that is the basic unit
of poetic justice.

05:46.274 --> 05:49.190
So, what did Lilith say?

05:49.359 --> 05:51.267
Uh, has Blaine really lost
the use of his legs?

She says she doesn't know,
but hopes so.

05:55.028 --> 05:57.731
All right, I guess there's only one way
I can prove this to you.

Daphne, may I borrow that lovely pin
you're wearing?

All right. There you go, Fras, my man.
Stick it anywhere you'd like.

You'd have to get up for that.

- All right, I guess I'll just do it myself.
DAPHNE: Oh.

Cool.

Come on, that is nothing
but a cheap parlour trick.

I thought you'd take
more convincing than that.

Would you have a butcher knife
in the kitchen?

06:28.294 --> 06:30.997
- Oh, I'll get it.
FRASIER: No, no, that's enough, Dad.

06:31.170 --> 06:32.201
Let's cut to the chase.

06:32.379 --> 06:34.287
What's it gonna cost me
to get you out of here?

06:34.463 --> 06:36.621
Frasier, you're almost right.
Almost right.

06:36.798 --> 06:39.003
It's true,
I do want something from you.

06:39.174 --> 06:44.378
But what I want is for you to get
down on your knees and pray with me.

06:44.551 --> 06:46.342
I know these words sound strange.

06:46.511 --> 06:49.510
But I've had
a deeply religious conversion.

- Really?
- Oh, this just gets better and better.

06:52.805 --> 06:54.596
I guess it started
with my car accident.

06:54.765 --> 06:58.214
I was driving drunk,
which I had done one too many times.

06:58.391 --> 07:00.015
Oh, you know, it was a sign.

07:00.184 --> 07:02.092
- From God?
- No, from the Highway Department.

07:02.268 --> 07:05.718
It said, "Lane ends"
and I just ploughed right into it.

07:05.895 --> 07:09.937
The next thing I saw
was a bright light and a tunnel.

07:10.105 --> 07:12.725
So you had
a near-death experience.

07:12.981 --> 07:14.938
No, it was a CAT scan.

07:17.067 --> 07:21.014
You know, when Dr. Kagan told me
I was paralyzed, well, I was devastated.

07:21.194 --> 07:25.688
There I was, the lowest point
a man can be. And he came to me.

07:25.863 --> 07:28.352
- Doctor Kagan?
- No, wrong again, hon.

07:28.531 --> 07:31.364
- It was God.
- Oh, damn.

07:32.783 --> 07:34.774
Hang in there, sweetheart.
You'll get one.

He showed me
how I'd squandered my life.

You know, cheating innocent people.
L... I was just filled with shame.

07:41.912 --> 07:42.990
That's why I'm here.

I've started a ministry to save souls
the way the Lord saved mine.

What genius. The Lord.

07:48.915 --> 07:52.531
A credible partner
who doesn't take a cut.

07:53.501 --> 07:55.741
Dr. Crane,
you should be ashamed of yourself.

07:55.918 --> 07:58.918
The fact that Mr. Sternin has turned
his accident into something positive.

07:59.087 --> 08:01.541
Well, it's one of the most
inspirational stories I've heard.

08:01.713 --> 08:04.381
Oh, Daphne, please. You have no idea
what this man is capable of.

08:04.548 --> 08:06.954
Sir, can I get you something
to eat or drink?

08:07.132 --> 08:09.124
I could use a beer.
I haven't given up everything.

08:09.300 --> 08:11.540
That is inspiring.
Yeah, make it two, Daph.

08:11.718 --> 08:14.800

to wait on me anymore.

the first step

08:25.516 --> 08:30.057

08:39.397 --> 08:41.104
Aren't you rushing to judgement,
Frasier?

08:41.273 --> 08:45.435
L... I know you two have a history,
but isn't it possible that he's changed?

08:45.609 --> 08:47.849
Oh, don't be a sucker, Niles.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.433
Dad, you're not buying
any of this medicine show, are you?

08:50.611 --> 08:52.816
Well, the guy is
laying it on pretty thick.

08:52.987 --> 08:58.192
But I guess he could be on the level.
I mean, that pin thing was freaky.

08:58.573 --> 09:00.861
I want to get that on video.

09:02.325 --> 09:04.233
Daphne, you left him alone
in the kitchen?

09:04.409 --> 09:07.990
My Sub-Zero's probably
on the way to a chop shop right now.

09:08.286 --> 09:10.823
All right, Blaine. I've had enough.
Get out.

09:10.996 --> 09:13.153
Frasier, look, I don't know how
to prove this to you.

09:13.330 --> 09:15.820
But I swear, all I really came for
was your forgiveness,

09:15.998 --> 09:17.954
first of all,
for stealing that little teapot.

09:18.124 --> 09:20.329
Salt server.

09:20.500 --> 09:23.665
Is that what that was?
Man, nobody knew.

09:23.835 --> 09:26.585
And for all the times I lied
and I cheated you.

09:26.753 --> 09:29.788
And for the time I posed as you
and treated patients for a year.

09:29.963 --> 09:31.373
- What?
- Only a couple of people.

09:31.547 --> 09:35.246
I'd tell you who they were, but I've got
that doctor-patient confidentiality thing.

09:35.424 --> 09:37.462
The point is,
that part of my life is over.

09:37.633 --> 09:40.004
I just... I don't know.
I just want to give something back.

09:40.176 --> 09:42.084
Really? If you wanted
to give something back,

09:42.261 --> 09:45.675
you'd be mopping a soup kitchen
or reading to bedridden vets,

09:45.846 --> 09:50.470
or travelling to the Galápagos Islands
to clean oil off some poor seafowl.

09:50.640 --> 09:52.263
Then maybe
you'd have some credibility.

09:52.432 --> 09:54.803
I know I've given you so many reasons
to mistrust me.

09:54.975 --> 09:57.512
But don't you believe
that people can change?

09:58.935 --> 10:03.227
If I forgive you,
will you leave and never return?

10:03.396 --> 10:06.099
Yes. I promise you you'll never see
my face in this house again,

10:06.272 --> 10:07.979
unless I'm invited.

10:09.565 --> 10:13.312
Very well.
I grant you this boon, and I forgive you.

10:13.484 --> 10:15.107
Now get out.

10:15.276 --> 10:18.110
Oh, Mr. Sternin,
I hope you'll stay for dinner.

10:21.404 --> 10:23.230
Sounds like an invitation to me, Fras.

10:28.699 --> 10:31.864
And so here's this kid,
no more than 15 years old.

10:32.034 --> 10:34.903
He lives in a cardboard box
under the overpass.

10:35.077 --> 10:37.069
And his mother comes to me
and begs me:

10:37.245 --> 10:38.703
"Will you get my kid off drugs?"

10:38.871 --> 10:41.195
Yes, yes, and then you cured him.
Let's eat.

10:41.372 --> 10:44.620
No, no, no. You don't cure something
like addiction overnight.

10:44.790 --> 10:47.908
Well, look who I'm telling. I mean,
you're a psychiatrist, you know.

10:48.083 --> 10:50.040
Well, that's true.
I have found in my research

10:50.209 --> 10:52.201
with addictive personalities that...

10:52.377 --> 10:54.665
Oh, for God's sake,
what the hell am I doing?

10:54.837 --> 10:57.540
- There probably is no kid anyway.
- Come on, let up on the guy.

10:57.713 --> 10:59.455
He's a man of God.

11:00.131 --> 11:03.545
Blaine, can I take a picture of you
with a fork in your leg?

11:05.842 --> 11:08.592
- All right, everybody. Dig in.
- Oh, right.

11:08.760 --> 11:11.166
- Thank you, Daphne.
- Oh, beautiful, Daphne.

11:11.344 --> 11:15.470
- Thank you, darling.
- Well, who wants to say grace?

11:15.805 --> 11:18.295
Oh, we almost forgot.

11:18.473 --> 11:20.678
Whose turn is it this time?

11:22.058 --> 11:23.765
Okay, I will.
Would you all join hands?

11:23.934 --> 11:25.475
Yes.

and this company.

and teach us to be forgiving,

11:39.816 --> 11:41.559
as you instructed your apostles.

11:41.734 --> 11:45.516
I'll give you 50 bucks
if you can name three of them.

11:46.361 --> 11:47.689
- Frasier.
FRASIER: Here you go.

11:47.862 --> 11:51.940
Two 20's and a 10.
Tell you what, I'll spot you John.

11:52.322 --> 11:54.990
Dr. Crane,
we're in the middle of a prayer.

11:55.157 --> 11:56.485
Please, go on.

11:59.034 --> 12:02.152
- Thank you, Lord. Amen.
ALL: Amen.

12:02.327 --> 12:03.785
Amen.

12:03.953 --> 12:07.616
You know, normally I get paid
after I say grace.

12:08.872 --> 12:10.910
Oh, I'm kidding. Ha, ha!

12:11.081 --> 12:12.658
He was kidding. That was funny.

12:12.832 --> 12:14.539
[CHUCKLING]

12:14.708 --> 12:17.541
You know, you're a godless bunch,
but I love you.

12:17.709 --> 12:18.989
[LAUGHTER]

12:19.168 --> 12:20.662
You know,
even worse than the godless

12:20.836 --> 12:22.792
are those who would use God
for their own gain.

12:22.962 --> 12:24.834
They are the true hypocrites

12:25.004 --> 12:28.169
who should burn in the fiery hell
for all eternity.

12:30.465 --> 12:33.037
Am I picking up a vibe here?

12:33.508 --> 12:36.294
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did you think that was directed at you?

12:36.927 --> 12:39.547
You know, I could quote you
chapter and verse all night

12:39.720 --> 12:41.795
to try to prove to you
that I'm a changed man.

12:41.971 --> 12:43.001
But you know what?

12:43.180 --> 12:47.092
Instead, why don't you come see me
in action on Sunday?

12:47.265 --> 12:48.379
What do you mean?

12:48.557 --> 12:49.636
Come and hear me preach.

12:49.808 --> 12:52.677
Witness what God can do
through me in all his splendour

12:52.851 --> 12:54.344
and all his glory
in the Regency Room

12:54.518 --> 12:56.759
down the at the airport Ramada.

12:58.187 --> 12:59.680
- I'd love to go.
- I wouldn't mind.

12:59.854 --> 13:01.597
- Sure, why not?
BLAINE: Bless you people.

13:01.772 --> 13:03.514
That's just great.
Thank you very much.

13:03.689 --> 13:06.523
Only problem is, the advertising
was just a skosh more than I thought,

13:06.691 --> 13:09.062
and I came up about $1000 short
on the hall rental.

13:09.234 --> 13:10.810
Aha!

13:10.984 --> 13:15.027
The other shoe comes cascading
from the sky.

13:15.195 --> 13:16.475
One thousand dollars you say.

13:16.654 --> 13:20.235
You're not getting it out of me, you
born-again Bilko. Didn't I tell you?

13:20.406 --> 13:23.026
Fras, you know,
what I was going to say,

13:23.199 --> 13:24.740
if you'd let me finish was,

13:24.908 --> 13:27.397
- somehow the Lord will provide.
- Oh.

13:27.576 --> 13:30.658
And by the way, Matthew, John,
Thomas, Bartholomew, Jude, Judas,

13:30.827 --> 13:34.823
two Jameses, Andrew, Peter,
Simon the Zealot and Philip.

13:34.996 --> 13:38.826
Nine-fifty to go.
Pass the potatoes, please.

13:44.584 --> 13:47.252
FRASIER: He says the Lord
will provide the money.

13:47.418 --> 13:50.583
But we all know who that means.
Me.

13:51.003 --> 13:54.252
You know, I've always had a thing
for evangelists.

13:54.422 --> 13:58.417
When I first started out, I worked
at this station back in Wisconsin,

13:58.590 --> 14:00.582
and there was this young preacher

14:00.758 --> 14:03.592
who had a show of his own
on Sunday mornings.

14:03.759 --> 14:06.463
He spent hours
trying to save my soul.

14:06.636 --> 14:07.880
[LAUGHS]

14:08.053 --> 14:09.428
And?

14:09.596 --> 14:12.963
And it worked. And now I'm a nun.
What do you think happened?

14:15.890 --> 14:17.052
- Hello.
- Oh, Daphne, Niles.

14:17.224 --> 14:18.255
Hi there.

14:18.433 --> 14:19.926
Well, Dr. Crane, you needn't worry

14:20.101 --> 14:22.175
about Blaine
asking you for money anymore.

14:22.352 --> 14:24.888
He's received the $1000
he needs for Sunday.

14:25.061 --> 14:29.009
- What nitwit gave him $1000?
- Now, Frasier, that's not fair.

14:29.188 --> 14:31.310
Perhaps whoever did it
simply has a kind heart

14:31.481 --> 14:34.848
and a trusting nature that I, for one,
find refreshing.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.356
Oh, Daphne.

14:38.943 --> 14:42.191
I come from a large family
of scoundrels and ne'er-do-wells

14:42.361 --> 14:44.566
who repeatedly promised me
they'd change their ways,

14:44.737 --> 14:46.314
and never made any effort.

14:46.488 --> 14:49.938
Now here is someone
who's actually trying and succeeding.

14:50.115 --> 14:52.687
Now, I think that's worthy
of a little encouragement.

14:52.866 --> 14:55.534
- Coffee, Niles? Mm.
- Yes, please.

14:55.701 --> 14:59.150
I can't believe Daphne got snowed
by that crook.

14:59.703 --> 15:02.737
Now, I've got to expose Blaine
for the charlatan that he is.

15:02.912 --> 15:06.410
What was the name of that doctor
he said treated him in Laughlin?

15:06.581 --> 15:09.580
Uh, it was Kagan, if memory serves.
Dr. Kagan.

15:09.749 --> 15:12.155
Shouldn't be too hard to find.

15:14.001 --> 15:17.368
[SLOWLY]
Laughlin, Nevada.

15:20.588 --> 15:23.622
Doctor Kagan.

15:24.965 --> 15:25.995
I'm being connected.

15:26.174 --> 15:29.837
Frasier, you're sure
you're not being a tad obsessive?

15:30.009 --> 15:32.296
Niles, this is about the truth.

15:32.802 --> 15:36.383
Yes, hello?
Uh, yes, Dr. Kagan, please?

15:36.553 --> 15:38.095
Busy?

15:38.263 --> 15:41.096
Too busy to talk with
Dr. Frasier Crane

15:41.264 --> 15:44.429
[SWEDISH ACCENT]
From the Nobel Prize Committee?

15:46.642 --> 15:47.720
Now, you may ask yourself,

15:47.892 --> 15:50.133
why would this man
spend the last hour

15:50.310 --> 15:51.424
preaching the word of God?

15:51.602 --> 15:56.345
Look what God did to him.
Well, I'll tell you what God did to me.

15:56.521 --> 16:00.184
He took away my legs
to show me how tall I could stand.

16:00.356 --> 16:01.766
[APPLAUSE]

16:01.940 --> 16:04.347
Because, until this happened,
I was not a whole man.

16:04.525 --> 16:09.066
I was a gambler.
I was a liar. I was a cheat.

16:09.236 --> 16:12.484
Everything you can imagine,
that was me.

16:12.654 --> 16:17.029
I did it. Oh, I was a bad man.
Go ahead, name something.

16:17.198 --> 16:18.905
- A thief?
- Oh, a thief.

16:19.074 --> 16:21.694
Not a day passed that I wasn't.
Anybody else? Come on.

16:21.867 --> 16:24.273
- A womanizer.
- Yeah, in between affairs.

16:24.451 --> 16:27.901
WOMAN: Tax evader.
- Yeah, but that was on principle.

16:28.953 --> 16:32.700
[WHISPERS] Come on, little sheep.
Come on into this nice little pen.

16:32.872 --> 16:34.745
DAPHNE: Shh!
- Thought you weren't coming.

16:34.914 --> 16:36.740
I just can't stand to see people
get fleeced.

16:36.915 --> 16:39.535
I left half a dozen messages
for this so-called doctor of his.

16:39.708 --> 16:42.542
I'll tell you, the guy comes back
with a different excuse every time

16:42.710 --> 16:44.120
why he can't come to the phone.

16:44.294 --> 16:48.420
Niles, I tell you, there is no such man
as this Dr. Kagan. He doesn't exist.

16:48.588 --> 16:52.630
And yet, for the first time in my life,
I'm a happy man.

16:52.798 --> 16:54.291
Oh, I can't dance the way I used to.

16:54.465 --> 16:57.002
But, you know,
my heart's turning cartwheels.

16:57.175 --> 17:01.005
I can't run, but there's no need
to hide anymore.

17:01.427 --> 17:03.833
I can't make love, but I can feel love.

17:04.012 --> 17:06.845
Now, do you want
that kind of happiness?

17:07.012 --> 17:10.546
Because if you do,
let me hear you say, "Yeah, I want it."

- Come on, like you really mean it.

17:13.723 --> 17:15.182
- Yeah!

This is no man of God.
He's a huckster.

I hate going anywhere with you.

This charade has got to stop right now.

to be bamboozled.

No, people, people.

He's one of God's creatures.

I am no such thing.

Thanks again for paying
in cash there, Fras.

It's my pleasure to do it.
