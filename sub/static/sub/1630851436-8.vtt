00:06.264 --> 00:08.099
- High heat?
Oh, please.

00:08.166 --> 00:09.701
No, I'd rather have it
with no heat.

00:09.801 --> 00:11.036
Why is that an option?

00:11.136 --> 00:12.203
- Mom?

00:12.304 --> 00:13.438
- All it does
is make me wonder,

00:13.505 --> 00:14.673
"Should I do with no heat?"

00:14.773 --> 00:15.940
- Mom.
- What?

00:16.007 --> 00:17.375
- You know how to
do laundry, right?

00:17.475 --> 00:19.511
- Pfft, I'm a mom.
I know how to do laundry.

00:19.611 --> 00:21.346
- My pants have been
pretty tight lately.

00:21.446 --> 00:24.716
I think maybe you're overdrying
them by, like, a good hour.

00:24.816 --> 00:26.284
- Tom, did you ever stop

00:26.351 --> 00:28.386
and think maybe you're
just becoming morbidly obese?

00:28.486 --> 00:29.888
- Mom, you know I'm not obese.

00:29.988 --> 00:31.890
- I look into your eyes
sometimes and I think,

00:31.990 --> 00:33.358
"Is he gonna one day

00:33.458 --> 00:35.060
have to get airlifted
out of his own bathroom?"

00:35.160 --> 00:36.728
- Why don't we just buy me
some new pants?

00:36.828 --> 00:38.163
At least I'll be comfortable.

00:38.229 --> 00:39.564
- Oh, it's that easy.

00:39.664 --> 00:41.833
We just stroll out
of the laundry shop...

00:41.900 --> 00:43.501
- Laundry shop?
- And we just go

00:43.568 --> 00:47.205
and casually buy
a nice pair of Z. Cavariccis.

00:47.305 --> 00:50.041
What is wrong with this thing?
Ugh!

00:50.141 --> 00:51.710
This thing ate my quarter.

00:51.810 --> 00:53.311
- You really shouldn't
be doing that here.

00:53.378 --> 00:56.348
- Oh, please, buddy.
Get off my nuts.

00:56.414 --> 00:58.249
- Girl, let's get some meat
on those bones.

00:58.350 --> 01:01.486
How about a little extra cheese
on those cheese fries?

01:01.553 --> 01:04.255
- Oh, so good.
You're the best, Lunch Lady.

01:04.356 --> 01:06.157
- Aww, go on.
You go on now.

01:06.224 --> 01:08.026
- Lunch lady!
Whoo!

01:08.093 --> 01:10.228
Let me get
two foot-long chili dogs.

01:10.328 --> 01:12.230
- Oh, God bless you, Nelson.

01:12.330 --> 01:14.332
My little hungry,
hungry hippo over here.

01:16.368 --> 01:18.203
- Hi there.
- Mm.

01:18.269 --> 01:20.872
- Can I just get
a small apple juice?

01:20.939 --> 01:23.441
- A what now?
- Small apple juice, please.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.343
I brown-bagged it,
so I don't need any food.

01:25.410 --> 01:27.278
- You don't need
any--any cheese?

01:27.379 --> 01:28.613
- Cheese on my apple juice?

01:28.713 --> 01:30.215
- I can't get you a--a cookie?

01:30.281 --> 01:32.050
- Just the juice,
no cheese or anything.

01:32.117 --> 01:35.687
- Can someone get this
idiot a small apple juice?

01:35.754 --> 01:38.790
- I'm feeling my banter wasn't
as much fun as everyone else's.

01:38.890 --> 01:40.225
I'm a hungry hippo.

01:40.291 --> 01:41.860
- Tom, it was awfully nice
of you to stop by.

01:41.926 --> 01:43.628
- All right.
You're the best, Lunch Lady.

01:43.728 --> 01:45.463
- Okay. Bye-bye now.

01:45.563 --> 01:47.298
- Oh, man.
- Nelson, keep walking.

01:47.399 --> 01:48.767
- Hey, dudes.
- Don't look left.

01:48.867 --> 01:51.903
- Hey, dudes, over here.
- Hey, Hector.

01:51.970 --> 01:53.538
- Hey, sit down.
- Listen.

01:53.605 --> 01:54.739
- Um...

01:54.806 --> 01:56.107
We--we decided to move on.

01:56.207 --> 01:58.143
We might mix up
the table arrangement.

01:58.243 --> 02:00.478
- Yeah, we're trying to upgrade
to a cooler table.

02:00.578 --> 02:02.313
- Guys, this is
a major betrayal.

02:02.414 --> 02:03.982
- Hector, please.
- We have inside jokes.

02:04.082 --> 02:05.817
- Hector.
- We already have a table name.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.752
You know, The Three Amigos,
Plus Randy.

02:07.819 --> 02:09.287
- No one calls us that.

02:09.387 --> 02:10.789
- No one call--even Randy
doesn't call--look at him.

02:10.889 --> 02:13.124
He don't even acknowledge us.

02:13.224 --> 02:15.160
I've never seen anybody
chew applesauce before.

02:15.260 --> 02:16.461
- Guys.

02:16.561 --> 02:18.163
- Hector, don't make it
so dramatic.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.131
- No. I'm not making it
dramatic, but I will say this.

02:20.231 --> 02:24.002
You will rue the day that you
decided to abandon Hector.

02:25.804 --> 02:26.938
- All right, fair enough.

02:27.005 --> 02:28.273
- I think we will
take our chances.

02:28.339 --> 02:30.341
- And then, like,
he has the nerve

02:30.442 --> 02:32.677
to ask me for, like,
my chocolate milk.

02:32.777 --> 02:33.978
- Hey, Dakota.

02:34.078 --> 02:35.647
- Whoo-whoo. What's up?
What's up?

02:35.747 --> 02:37.315
- Oh, hi, Tom.
- Hey.

02:37.415 --> 02:38.917
- Hi, Nelson.

02:38.983 --> 02:42.253
Everyone, this is--this is
Tom and Nelson. I know them.

02:42.320 --> 02:43.922
- Okay.
- We thought we'd sit.

02:43.988 --> 02:45.323
We thought
we'd join you guys.

02:45.423 --> 02:48.493
- Uh, you want to sit here?
- Yeah.

02:48.593 --> 02:50.628
- With us?
- I don't feel good about this.

02:50.695 --> 02:53.298
- That is a yes.
Oh, I'm Nelson, by the way.

02:53.364 --> 02:56.301
I'm a, what you might call
the fun one out of the duo.

02:56.367 --> 02:58.536
You know what I'm saying?

02:58.636 --> 03:00.205
- Yeah.
- Whoo!

03:00.305 --> 03:02.273
- I feel like this banter
is really flowing.

03:02.340 --> 03:03.842
- Can I have a word, Tom?

03:03.942 --> 03:05.777
- Oh, hey, Lunch Lady,
not a great time, actually.

03:05.844 --> 03:07.846
- I've been thinking about
this brown-bag thing.

03:07.946 --> 03:10.782
Are my cooking skills not up
to your standards anymore?

03:10.849 --> 03:12.383
- Oh, no. It's not you.
You're great.

03:12.484 --> 03:13.885
My mom just thinks, you know,

03:13.985 --> 03:15.386
with the kind of food
they make you serve,

03:15.487 --> 03:17.021
that you're part
of the problem.

03:17.121 --> 03:18.289
- Oh, I'm part of the problem,
am I?

03:18.356 --> 03:19.524
- Her words, not mine.

03:19.624 --> 03:20.792
- I'm part of the problem?

03:20.859 --> 03:23.228
- Tom,
why are you being so mean?

03:23.328 --> 03:25.396
- Mean?
- Yeah. Who even is this guy?

03:25.497 --> 03:28.066
- I said her words, not mine.
They're not my words.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.400
- Ugh.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.402
- Tom, I devote my whole life
to you kids.

03:31.503 --> 03:33.905
And this is the thanks I get?
I'm going home.

03:34.005 --> 03:35.640
- Oh, no. Please. Please.

03:35.707 --> 03:38.476
- Now, you have some extra
cheese and it's on the house.

03:40.979 --> 03:42.914
- Wow.
- Like I was saying,

03:43.014 --> 03:44.315
I'm the fun one out of the duo.

03:44.382 --> 03:45.884
I didn't even really know
this dude.

03:45.984 --> 03:47.719
We met on the bus.

03:47.819 --> 03:50.088
<i>- Wait, you said what
to the lunch lady?</i>

03:50.188 --> 03:52.257
- I mean, I might've said
she was part of the problem

03:52.357 --> 03:53.525
if that--that set her off.

03:53.591 --> 03:54.826
- You said that?

03:54.893 --> 03:56.160
- I was just repeating
what you said.

03:56.227 --> 03:57.762
I've heard you say
things like that.

03:57.862 --> 04:00.164
- No, no, no. Look, I said
all that behind her back.

04:00.231 --> 04:02.534
- Look, the woman has been
working here for 20 years.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.102
You're a human being.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.904
Why would you wanna tear her
a new a-hole like that?

04:06.004 --> 04:07.438
- I didn't tear anyone
a new a-hole.

04:07.539 --> 04:09.073
I'm not even allowed
to say a-hole.

04:09.173 --> 04:10.942
- No, you're not.
- Right? It's a forbidden word.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.577
- It's a forbidden word.

04:12.677 --> 04:14.212
And you're gonna get punished
for saying it just now.

04:14.279 --> 04:15.747
- He said it.
I was repeating what he said.

04:15.847 --> 04:17.615
- Yeah.
Well, his mom can punish him.

04:17.715 --> 04:19.717
- My mom's dead.
- I'm sorry, Principal.

04:19.784 --> 04:20.952
- Sorry to hear that.

04:21.052 --> 04:22.687
- Here's how
it's gonna go down.

04:22.754 --> 04:24.122
You're gonna walk over
to the lunch lady's house

04:24.222 --> 04:26.190
and you're gonna
apologize in person.

04:26.257 --> 04:28.092
- Look at you. Great parenting.
I'm impressed.

04:28.192 --> 04:29.394
- Oh, I'm not finished.

04:29.460 --> 04:31.129
As a reminder
of what you've done,

04:31.229 --> 04:34.465
you can't wash the cheese
out of your hair for a month.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.301
- All right. Is it just me,
or is that a bit much?

04:36.401 --> 04:38.136
- Yeah, it's a bit much.

04:40.605 --> 04:41.806
- Whew.

04:41.906 --> 04:43.241
Thanks for waiting.
Thank you guys.

04:43.308 --> 04:44.709
- Man, what's up
with the big card, Tom?

04:44.776 --> 04:46.611
- I have to apologize
to the lunch lady,

04:46.711 --> 04:48.579
so I made an oversized card.

04:48.646 --> 04:50.448
- Wow. Look, you got a lot
of people to sign.

04:50.548 --> 04:52.383
- Oh, no. Those are fake.
I signed them myself.

04:52.450 --> 04:53.651
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

04:53.751 --> 04:55.253
You didn't sign for me.
Did you?

04:55.320 --> 04:58.056
- Yeah. You wrote,
"Thinking of you, Lunch Lady,

04:58.122 --> 05:00.792
during these troubled times.
Signed, Sweet Nelson."

05:00.892 --> 05:02.594
- Come on, man!
You think I talk like that?

05:02.660 --> 05:03.962
I'd have at least
written something funny.

05:04.062 --> 05:05.396
- She's not even gonna read it.

05:05.463 --> 05:06.764
- This is bad for my brand
right here.

05:06.831 --> 05:08.399
- Hey, you didn't sign for me,
did you?

05:08.466 --> 05:09.934
- I believe I did. Yeah.

05:10.001 --> 05:11.736
You wrote,
"Hey, ho, Lunch Lady--"

05:11.803 --> 05:13.271
- What?
- "You da bomb.

05:13.338 --> 05:14.472
Signed, Crazy D."

05:14.572 --> 05:16.174
- Crazy D?
- I wrote these quickly.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.775
I wrote these very quickly.

05:17.842 --> 05:19.344
- Why didn't you just ask me
to sign it myself?

05:19.444 --> 05:20.812
- Oh, I don't have time
to be going around

05:20.912 --> 05:22.614
asking people to sign
a greeting card.

05:22.680 --> 05:26.618
- But you had time to forge
all of our signatures.

05:27.652 --> 05:30.154
- Tom,
what are you doing here?

05:30.254 --> 05:32.590
- You know, I just wanted
to say sorry, clear the air.

05:32.657 --> 05:34.659
In retrospect, you're not part
of the problem. I am.

05:34.759 --> 05:37.462
- Damn right.
Can I--can I come in?

05:37.528 --> 05:39.197
- Okay, fine. Come in.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.633
- All right.
So to show how sorry I am,

05:41.699 --> 05:43.868
and to show what
a wonderful kid I am,

05:43.968 --> 05:46.371
I made this oversized
greeting card.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.706
-
Oh, my God.

05:48.806 --> 05:51.509
- There must be like
200 signatures on that, baby.

05:51.609 --> 05:53.144
Look at this.
- Isn't that sweet?

05:53.211 --> 05:55.546
- Wait.
"You're the best Lunch Lady."

05:55.647 --> 05:58.216
"Lunch Lady, come back."
"Number one Lunch Lady."

05:58.316 --> 06:00.718
There's literally no one in
this school know my first name?

06:00.818 --> 06:02.387
- We all know your name.
Obviously, we just--

06:02.487 --> 06:03.988
- What is it?

06:04.055 --> 06:05.556
- We prefer to call you
Lunch Lady is all I'm saying,

06:05.657 --> 06:07.058
despite knowing your name.

06:07.158 --> 06:09.694
- What's my first name?

06:09.794 --> 06:12.330
- Pretty sure it's either Becky
or Brenda or Barb, right?

06:12.397 --> 06:13.564
- Becky?
- Unbelievable.

06:13.665 --> 06:14.699
Where's my ladle?

06:14.799 --> 06:16.200
- Calm down, girl.
- No.

06:16.300 --> 06:18.069
- See, this kid
is pushing my buttons, no.

06:18.169 --> 06:20.071
- It's just a--baby,
it's just a greeting card.

06:20.171 --> 06:21.706
- All right, listen,
let's all slow down.

06:21.806 --> 06:23.074
Obviously,
they want you back.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.842
Why don't you say yes,
but ask for,

06:24.909 --> 06:26.744
I don't know,
a raise or something?

06:26.844 --> 06:29.213
Hm.
- Now, that is a good idea.

06:29.313 --> 06:30.682
- Right?
- It's a great idea.

06:30.748 --> 06:32.850
- Tell the Principal
you love Tom's card,

06:32.917 --> 06:34.152
you wanna come back,

06:34.218 --> 06:35.920
but here's--
here are your terms.

06:36.020 --> 06:39.090
- I might just do that.
You know, you're a good kid.

06:39.190 --> 06:40.591
Why--why don't you
stay for dinner?

06:40.692 --> 06:42.160
- I'd love to.
Do you have any kind of like

06:42.226 --> 06:44.028
whole wheat sandwiches
and bananas?

06:44.095 --> 06:45.596
- Whole wheat?
- You know what?

06:45.697 --> 06:47.899
Let's--let's just do dinner
some other time, okay?

06:47.999 --> 06:50.034
- I'm proud of you, buddy.
- Thanks, Mom.

06:50.101 --> 06:51.769
- You apologized
to the Lunch Lady.

06:51.869 --> 06:54.038
And now, I'm gonna wash
the cheese out of your hair.

06:54.105 --> 06:55.573
- It's a big day.

06:55.673 --> 06:56.774
And you don't wannna do this
in the tub or the shower?

06:56.874 --> 06:58.009
- Oh, no, no, no.

06:58.076 --> 06:59.610
I don't want cheese
in my drain.

06:59.711 --> 07:01.846
- All right, just start
spraying me down, I guess.

07:03.281 --> 07:04.682
- Hang on one sec. Hello?

07:04.749 --> 07:06.084
<i>- Hi, this is the Principal.</i>

07:06.184 --> 07:07.785
- Hi.
Oh, hi, Principal. Sorry.

07:07.885 --> 07:10.221
- Listen. I just got a call
from our lunch lady

07:10.288 --> 07:13.257
and she is making all type
of like crazy demands.

07:13.357 --> 07:15.593
Something about the health
benefits and fair wages.

07:15.693 --> 07:18.463
So I wanted to see
if you might be interested.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.965
- In what?
<i>- In being the new lunch lady.</i>

07:21.065 --> 07:22.633
- You want me to be
the lunch lady?

07:22.734 --> 07:24.869
- Lunch lady? Oh, no.
We already have a lunch lady.

07:24.936 --> 07:26.270
- I was very impressed
with you

07:26.370 --> 07:27.972
the way you handled Tom
the other day.

07:28.072 --> 07:30.074
That whole cheese thing,
I mean, that's real tough love.

07:30.141 --> 07:32.310
- Thank you. I would love
to be the lunch lady.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.212
I need the money.
I love bossing kids around.

07:34.278 --> 07:35.313
This is perfect.

07:35.413 --> 07:36.814
- Not qualified.
Not qualified.

07:36.914 --> 07:38.449
- Do I need
a certification or what--

07:38.549 --> 07:39.951
- No. Stop it.

07:40.051 --> 07:42.153
You just stand there
with a ladle and a hairnet.

07:42.253 --> 07:44.455
And as long as you're not
an ex-con, you're hired.

07:44.555 --> 07:47.158
- For argument's sake,
let's say I'm not an ex-con.

07:47.258 --> 07:48.493
Count me in.

07:48.593 --> 07:49.827
- Oh, this is not good.

07:49.927 --> 07:52.764
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

07:52.830 --> 07:54.132
- What's up?

07:54.232 --> 07:56.067
- I've been waiting for,
like, 10 minutes.

07:56.134 --> 07:57.602
- Okay. Sorry, kid.

07:57.668 --> 07:59.403
I mean, I just--
I just turned the oven on,

07:59.470 --> 08:01.672
and it's, like, you expect me
to wake up at 11:00 a.m.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.841
and get the oven going
really early or something.

08:03.941 --> 08:05.409
It's just not gonna happen.

08:05.476 --> 08:07.478
- What happened to the
old lunch lady? You're mean.

08:07.578 --> 08:09.847
- When your husband runs away
to Myrtle Beach

08:09.947 --> 08:11.282
and starts nailing a slut,

08:11.349 --> 08:14.018
and they stay out
till 4:00 at "Da Club"

08:14.118 --> 08:17.021
and she's grinding her butt
into his crotch,

08:17.121 --> 08:18.689
I think you'd be mean too.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.792
- How did you get hired here?

08:20.858 --> 08:23.461
- Hi, kid. What?

08:23.528 --> 08:26.164
- Here we are at the old table.
- Hey, hey.

08:26.264 --> 08:27.932
- Sorry. Before you sit,
no room today.

08:27.999 --> 08:29.634
- Wait, what?
- Full up.

08:29.700 --> 08:31.502
- Whoa. Was it all small talk?
I mean, we could dial down

08:31.602 --> 08:34.338
the Tom stuff
and dial up the Nelson stuff.

08:34.438 --> 08:35.773
- Yeah, we can
dial down the Tom.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.509
- Nelson, it is not you.
It's Tom's mom.

08:38.609 --> 08:40.444
She's ruining lunch
for everyone.

08:40.511 --> 08:41.879
- Oh, no.
She's--my mom's pretty solid.

08:41.979 --> 08:43.147
Everyone seems to like her.

08:43.214 --> 08:44.549
- Who? Who likes her?

08:44.649 --> 08:46.050
- What's wrong with her,
specifically?

08:46.150 --> 08:48.519
- She takes forever
to fulfill your order.

08:48.619 --> 08:49.720
- Okay.

08:49.821 --> 08:51.389
- She threw broccoli
at my face.

08:51.489 --> 08:53.224
She could have killed me.
I could have died.

08:53.324 --> 08:54.559
- I mean, come on.

08:54.659 --> 08:56.294
You can't die
from broccoli wounds.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.196
- She didn't even have the oven
on when lunch started.

08:58.296 --> 08:59.797
- That's it?
Lazy, mean, and unprepared?

08:59.864 --> 09:01.232
- I'm sorry, Tom.

09:01.332 --> 09:03.901
Until you resolve this,
you can't sit with us.

09:04.001 --> 09:07.405
- Oh, this is bad.
Look, Tom, your mom got to go.

09:07.505 --> 09:08.840
- Go where?
- Outta here.

09:08.906 --> 09:10.541
She's like the Fredo
of the cafeteria.

09:10.641 --> 09:12.643
- Fredo? Who's that?
Famous lunch lady?

09:13.878 --> 09:15.513
I don't even know
why we're friends.

09:17.181 --> 09:20.184
- Hey, Hector, buddy.
Listen, we got a favor to ask.

09:20.251 --> 09:22.987
- Oh, all of a sudden I'm
everybody's pal and buddy, huh?

09:23.054 --> 09:26.757
- We're staging a coup
against my mom to get her fired

09:26.858 --> 09:28.092
and we kind of need your help.

09:28.192 --> 09:30.061
- Okay. Okay.

09:30.161 --> 09:33.931
- Her main weakness is her
failure to wear the hairnet.

09:34.031 --> 09:35.433
That's gonna be her downfall.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.034
- Oh, tell me more.

09:37.101 --> 09:39.937
- I'm gonna collect her hair--
a sample of her hair,

09:40.037 --> 09:41.873
and then we need you
to choke on it.

09:41.939 --> 09:43.741
- And then I'll come
and give you the Heimlich.

09:43.841 --> 09:44.942
- Okay.

09:45.042 --> 09:46.677
- She'll get canned, boom.
- Yeah.

09:46.744 --> 09:48.446
- We're all heroes,
and guess what?

09:48.546 --> 09:50.448
All three of us amigos would be
sitting at the cool table.

09:50.548 --> 09:51.616
- Nice.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.384
- What do you think?
What do you say?

09:53.451 --> 09:55.052
- I like that. Yeah, I'm in.
One condition, though, guys.

09:55.119 --> 09:56.587
I want to be
the Heimlich guy, okay?

09:56.687 --> 09:57.855
- No.
- No. No, no.

09:57.922 --> 09:59.457
- Absolutely not.

09:59.557 --> 10:00.958
- You just don't look like
the kind of person that would

10:01.058 --> 10:02.460
come in and save someone,
you look like--

10:02.560 --> 10:03.895
- You look like
somebody that choked.

10:03.961 --> 10:05.196
- Yeah, in a movie,
you'd be the guy

10:05.263 --> 10:06.764
who chokes and dies
early on.

10:06.864 --> 10:09.133
- Wait, wait, wait.
I'm not gonna die in this.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.435
- No, that's the type.
That's the character type.

10:11.535 --> 10:13.738
- That's your arc.

10:13.804 --> 10:15.973
- Okay, guys, huddle up.
It's game time.

10:16.073 --> 10:17.808
- Yes, sir.
- Here's the hair.

10:17.909 --> 10:19.610
- Okay.
- You stuff it in your food.

10:19.710 --> 10:21.545
When you're ready,
just work the space.

10:21.612 --> 10:22.980
- Oh, trust me,
I'll work the space.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.483
- Make some good sounds.
Choke it up--

10:25.583 --> 10:27.151
- Quick--quick question, sorry.

10:27.251 --> 10:28.920
If--if I actually choke
and die, you guys won't sit

10:28.986 --> 10:30.554
at the cool table
without me, will you?

10:30.621 --> 10:32.823
- It would be in poor taste,
but who knows?

10:32.924 --> 10:34.926
- Let's cross that bridge
when we come to it.

10:34.992 --> 10:37.495
For now, just wait
for my signal.

10:40.665 --> 10:42.300
- Is that the signal, Tom?
- I don't know.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.835
We didn't rehearse that.
Just start doing it.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.237
I think that's it.

10:46.304 --> 10:48.172
- Oops. Oops. Arghhh!

10:48.272 --> 10:50.841
- Oh, no. Hey, hey,
Hector's choking.

10:50.942 --> 10:52.343
I think he's choking
on my mom's hair.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.679
- Somebody call the nurse.
- I'm choking!

10:56.147 --> 10:57.615
- Guys.
Come on, pay attention here.

10:57.682 --> 11:00.851
Our friend is--he's
literally dying.

11:00.952 --> 11:04.121
Hector, dial it down.
No one believes it's real.

11:04.188 --> 11:05.656
- Everybody stand back.

11:05.756 --> 11:08.426
Hector, I'm going
to Heimlich you. Turn around.

11:08.492 --> 11:09.794
All right. Ready?

11:13.030 --> 11:15.166
- Oh, no. Hector.
Hector, are you dead?

11:15.266 --> 11:16.534
- What's going on?

11:16.634 --> 11:17.768
Why does something
always have to happen?

11:17.835 --> 11:19.103
- Here's what we know.

11:19.170 --> 11:20.638
Hector choked
on my mother's hair.

11:20.705 --> 11:22.940
She failed to wear
the hairnet as instructed.

11:23.007 --> 11:24.675
- Hang on, hang on.
Get up, Hector.

11:24.775 --> 11:26.544
- Ah!
- Oh, wow. He's alive.

11:26.644 --> 11:27.845
What a close call.

11:27.945 --> 11:29.280
- Tom, is this a coup?
- Coup?

11:29.347 --> 11:30.648
- Are you doing a coup
right now?

11:30.715 --> 11:32.216
Are you trying to get me fired?

11:32.316 --> 11:34.051
- What makes you even suggest
something like that?

11:34.151 --> 11:37.388
- I guess it's mostly that
you're holding a bag that says,

11:37.488 --> 11:39.390
"Mom's hair for the coup."

11:39.490 --> 11:41.726
- Tom, that is a new low.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.028
You're trying to get
your own mom fired?

11:44.128 --> 11:45.463
- Why is everyone
looking at me?

11:45.529 --> 11:47.298
- 'Cause you did it.
- 'Cause I did it?

11:47.365 --> 11:49.166
'Cause I am the one
who did the whole thing?

11:49.233 --> 11:51.302
- Who should we be looking at?
- I guess, yeah, on that level,

11:51.369 --> 11:53.037
I don't come across
looking great.

11:53.137 --> 11:55.873
- Who do you think you are?
- I tried to warn you guys.

11:55.973 --> 11:57.008
- All right, guys.

11:57.074 --> 11:58.642
Don't leave on that note.
Come on.

11:58.709 --> 12:00.544
- Tom, listen.
You know that I love you.

12:00.644 --> 12:01.846
- Okay.

12:01.912 --> 12:03.814
- And as a mom,
I totally forgive you.

12:03.881 --> 12:05.850
- Thank you.
That's a nice way to end it.

12:05.916 --> 12:07.318
- But as a lunch lady,

12:07.385 --> 12:09.920
I have no choice right now
but to do this.

12:10.021 --> 12:11.222
- Oh, no.

12:11.322 --> 12:13.491
- You're gonna thank me someday
for that.

12:14.825 --> 12:17.328
- That was for my wife.
That's her signature move.

12:17.395 --> 12:19.597
You really shouldn't be
ripping that off.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.733
- Oh, this is actually
a nice--

12:22.833 --> 12:24.702
nice mother-son moment.
