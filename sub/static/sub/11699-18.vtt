00:04.457 --> 00:06.591
Okay, Emma. One cheerio at a time.

00:06.692 --> 00:09.127
Walk to Daddy. I know you can do it.

00:09.228 --> 00:10.895
She's seconds away from walking.

00:10.996 --> 00:12.497
I can tell. Come on, Emma.

00:12.598 --> 00:14.132
Ben, she will walk when she's ready.

00:14.233 --> 00:15.900
Okay? She's a woman.

00:16.001 --> 00:18.302
If she knows you want
it, she ain't gonna do it.

00:18.403 --> 00:19.403
Go to work.

00:19.504 --> 00:20.471
- (Sighs)
- Fine.

00:20.573 --> 00:21.573
But if I miss her first steps,

00:21.674 --> 00:23.274
I'm holding all of you responsible.

00:23.375 --> 00:24.375
Bye, Baby.

00:25.844 --> 00:27.579
- (Door closes)
- I don't know.

00:27.680 --> 00:28.713
She looks pretty ready to me.

00:29.748 --> 00:30.848
Come here, Emma.

00:30.950 --> 00:32.183
Walk to your uncle Danny.

00:34.587 --> 00:35.920
Come here, Baby.

00:37.222 --> 00:38.722
(Gasps)

00:38.823 --> 00:40.291
Ohh.

00:41.593 --> 00:43.561
Tucker and Riley: Ben, wait!

00:57.342 --> 00:59.076
Well, we didn't catch him.

00:59.177 --> 01:00.410
I forgot that when he hears a girl

01:00.411 --> 01:01.411
shouting his name on the street,

01:01.412 --> 01:02.312
he just runs faster.

01:02.413 --> 01:04.247
- (Chuckles)
- It's fine.

01:04.348 --> 01:06.549
We'll just call Ben and
tell him what he missed.

01:06.651 --> 01:08.251
Okay, no one is calling anyone.

01:09.587 --> 01:11.922
- That was actually your phone.
- I hate you.

01:13.124 --> 01:15.325
Ben would be devastated if he found out

01:15.426 --> 01:16.893
that he missed Emma's first steps.

01:16.995 --> 01:18.762
Well, maybe we can reenact it

01:18.863 --> 01:20.363
so it seems like the first time?

01:20.464 --> 01:22.132
Both: Yeah, that never works.

01:24.001 --> 01:26.969
Look, Ben is a great dad.

01:27.070 --> 01:29.239
There's only one thing to do.

01:29.340 --> 01:30.840
Lie lie lie

01:30.941 --> 01:32.975
like we have never lied before.

01:33.076 --> 01:34.644
So what if Ben misses this?

01:34.745 --> 01:37.780
I mean, he has missed a lot of firsts.

01:37.881 --> 01:39.015
Like her birth.

01:39.116 --> 01:40.816
Okay, maybe Ben didn't start out

01:40.917 --> 01:42.217
being the best dad,

01:42.318 --> 01:44.020
but he has come a long way.

01:44.121 --> 01:45.121
All you boys have.

01:49.459 --> 01:51.360
Here you go.

01:51.461 --> 01:53.162
There.

01:53.263 --> 01:55.597
Okay. Hi. Hi.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:07.409 --> 02:08.543
Hold her.

02:20.822 --> 02:22.022
Whee!

02:22.123 --> 02:23.291
Isn't this fun?

02:23.392 --> 02:26.227
- There you go.
- (Gasps)

02:26.328 --> 02:27.928
Want to maybe

02:28.029 --> 02:29.263
take a step over here?

02:29.364 --> 02:30.464
Is she okay?

02:30.566 --> 02:32.032
Uh-huh.

02:33.502 --> 02:35.069
Have a seat.

02:35.170 --> 02:36.204
Oh.

02:36.305 --> 02:38.638
Nice and easy.

02:40.374 --> 02:41.708
Ah.

02:45.045 --> 02:46.346
Is she having fun?

02:48.282 --> 02:49.382
Yeah.

02:49.483 --> 02:50.783
You guys look comfy.

02:52.620 --> 02:53.687
Excuse me.

02:53.787 --> 02:54.987
How old is your baby?

02:56.324 --> 02:58.557
Oh, um... that's a good question.

02:58.658 --> 03:01.460
I met Angela at that party in the village,

03:01.561 --> 03:03.295
- Mm.
- We dated for maybe six weeks

03:03.396 --> 03:05.831
before we were intimate.

03:08.668 --> 03:12.003
And she broke up with me
pretty much right after that.

03:12.105 --> 03:14.506
I'm sure there's no correlation.

03:15.875 --> 03:17.242
So we're into August now,

03:17.343 --> 03:18.909
and they take like nine months

03:19.010 --> 03:19.944
once they're up and running?

03:20.045 --> 03:22.380
- I think so.
- So...

03:25.718 --> 03:27.952
(Sighs)

03:28.053 --> 03:29.554
(Mouths)

03:29.655 --> 03:30.622
Three months.

03:30.723 --> 03:32.290
Three months.

03:32.391 --> 03:33.424
My baby's three months old.

03:33.525 --> 03:35.260
(Chuckles)

03:35.361 --> 03:36.893
This plan is not working.

03:36.994 --> 03:39.129
I'm out of food, the diaper's history,

03:39.230 --> 03:40.597
and the new one's gonna blow any minute.

03:40.698 --> 03:42.232
And apparently, there's some new rule

03:42.333 --> 03:44.234
about bringing babies into the locker room?

03:44.335 --> 03:45.902
Hey, buddy!

03:46.003 --> 03:47.036
Why don't you put a towel on or something?

03:47.138 --> 03:48.372
I've got a baby over here.

03:48.473 --> 03:49.839
Rude.

03:49.940 --> 03:51.174
I cannot do this, okay?

03:51.276 --> 03:52.175
I've got a lap full of pee,

03:52.277 --> 03:53.410
and it isn't even mine.

03:55.580 --> 03:57.281
Hey! I can really use a diaper out here,

03:57.382 --> 03:58.782
and I know one of y'all's holding.

04:00.250 --> 04:01.684
20 bucks for a diaper, miss, please?

04:01.785 --> 04:03.419
Baby or senior, at this
point it really don't matter.

04:03.520 --> 04:05.020
Where you going?

04:05.121 --> 04:06.889
The cops are after us!

04:06.990 --> 04:08.223
We just broke into our
neighbor's apartment.

04:08.325 --> 04:10.359
You have to hide us!

04:10.460 --> 04:12.828
You took Emma on a heist?

04:12.929 --> 04:14.563
See?

04:14.665 --> 04:16.798
Most fathers wouldn't do that.

04:18.334 --> 04:20.035
Okay, Emma. I gotta get to work.

04:20.136 --> 04:22.103
I'll see you at home, okay? All right.

04:22.204 --> 04:23.571
(Chuckles)

04:23.673 --> 04:26.641
Sorry about that.

04:26.742 --> 04:28.142
So are you sure there's nothing you can do?

04:28.243 --> 04:30.545
Actually, I think there is.

04:30.646 --> 04:32.246
I didn't realize you were a couple.

04:34.917 --> 04:37.552
Who, me and Juice Box?

04:37.653 --> 04:39.086
Yeah.

04:39.188 --> 04:40.822
I mean, I bi-racial gay couple?

04:40.923 --> 04:42.489
That's like hitting the jackpot

04:42.590 --> 04:44.325
on the diversity form.

04:44.426 --> 04:46.194
Really?

04:46.295 --> 04:47.995
Yeah, you are a couple, aren't you?

04:48.096 --> 04:51.299
Yes, we are.

04:51.399 --> 04:54.168
A couple of guys raising a baby together.

04:54.269 --> 04:55.636
Baby's at the ready.

04:57.405 --> 04:58.840
Oh, yeah.

04:58.941 --> 04:59.973
In three,

05:00.074 --> 05:01.408
two, one.

05:01.509 --> 05:02.976
- Roll! Roll!
- Come on, Emma.

05:03.077 --> 05:04.478
Come on, Emma. Come to Daddy.

05:04.579 --> 05:06.313
- Oh oh oh oh.
- This way. Lead with your head.

05:06.414 --> 05:07.881
- Oh oh!
- Emma, this way.

05:07.982 --> 05:11.251
- Come on, Baby, come on.
- Emma Emma Emma.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.520
All: Emma?

05:13.621 --> 05:14.822
- Tucker: Where's the baby?
- Emma?

05:14.922 --> 05:16.557
- Emma?
- Found her. Under the table.

05:16.658 --> 05:18.091
Wait, here is my retainer.

05:18.192 --> 05:20.293
I have been looking everywhere for this.

05:20.394 --> 05:21.494
Okay.

05:21.595 --> 05:23.163
Be careful. Grab this end.

05:23.264 --> 05:24.364
All right. On three.

05:24.465 --> 05:25.732
One, two, three.

05:25.833 --> 05:27.067
(Danny and Tucker grunt)

05:27.168 --> 05:28.335
It's okay.

05:28.435 --> 05:29.702
Knock-knock. Child services.

05:33.007 --> 05:35.775
Yeah, you really should
get used to hearing that.

05:38.545 --> 05:40.946
Bonnie: Danny, just put her down.

05:41.047 --> 05:44.116
It's not like she has a
limited number of steps in her.

05:44.217 --> 05:46.018
Well, what if she does?

05:46.119 --> 05:48.320
What if she uses them
all before Ben gets home?

05:48.421 --> 05:50.222
Well, if she runs out,

05:50.323 --> 05:52.224
she can always borrow some of mine.

05:52.325 --> 05:53.492
(Chuckles)

05:53.593 --> 05:55.361
Dude, I swear you know less about babies

05:55.461 --> 05:56.661
than those two.

05:58.265 --> 05:59.964
- Mom?
- Yeah, Sweetie?

06:09.909 --> 06:12.977
Is it just me, or does Emma
look a little different?

06:13.078 --> 06:14.145
What is going on?

06:14.246 --> 06:15.679
Why do you look like that?

06:15.781 --> 06:17.015
Well, today we learned

06:17.116 --> 06:19.550
that a picnic with Emma is no picnic.

06:19.651 --> 06:20.718
What's the emergency?

06:22.987 --> 06:24.488
Oh my God. Is that Gerard?

06:24.589 --> 06:28.225
Danny, I explicitly asked
you not to set me up with him.

06:28.326 --> 06:30.127
You promised.

06:30.228 --> 06:32.229
Okay, I'll tell him you're not interested.

06:32.330 --> 06:34.231
But he wouldn't stop talking about you.

06:34.332 --> 06:36.199
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

06:36.301 --> 06:37.835
Well...

06:37.936 --> 06:39.803
You know, then it would
be rude not to say hi

06:39.904 --> 06:41.471
now that I'm here, then, right?

06:41.572 --> 06:43.139
You two ladies wanna tamp it down?

06:43.240 --> 06:45.875
- (Imitates teenage girl)
- Please, don't call my mom.

06:45.976 --> 06:47.777
She will totally freak out.

06:47.878 --> 06:50.146
And if she grounds me, I'm gonna miss Prom.

06:50.247 --> 06:52.348
And I think that David and I might

06:52.450 --> 06:56.085
actually... do it.

06:57.220 --> 06:58.287
Shut up.

06:58.388 --> 07:00.556
- You shut up.
- The two of you shut up.

07:02.892 --> 07:04.893
You two should take this act on the road.

07:04.994 --> 07:07.696
Oh, but you can't,
because where I come from,

07:07.797 --> 07:10.499
using an innocent little
baby to steal a diamond watch

07:10.600 --> 07:13.401
is what we like to call a felony.

07:13.503 --> 07:14.703
Where did that come from?

07:14.804 --> 07:15.771
We didn't put that in there.

07:15.872 --> 07:17.840
Tell it to your parole officer, Sister.

07:17.941 --> 07:21.042
Mom, why am I standing
here holding a black baby?

07:23.312 --> 07:24.679
Um, okay.

07:24.780 --> 07:27.548
You know, actually, Ben,
that is a very good question.

07:27.649 --> 07:29.884
Are you sure that she's
not in there somewhere?

07:29.986 --> 07:31.286
Mom! Where's Emma?

07:31.387 --> 07:34.022
Well, obviously she's with Marcus.

07:34.123 --> 07:37.258
Who should have no trouble
getting her to sleep.

07:39.962 --> 07:42.363
We must have accidentally
switched the strollers.

07:42.464 --> 07:43.964
I mean, it could happen to anyone.

07:44.065 --> 07:45.765
I want my baby back. You call him.

07:45.867 --> 07:47.868
Right right. I have his number

07:47.969 --> 07:49.136
in my phone.

07:49.237 --> 07:52.106
Oh... see how smart you are?

07:52.207 --> 07:54.041
Okay, uh, it's ringing.

07:54.142 --> 07:55.775
(Cellphone rings)

08:00.247 --> 08:01.680
Hello?

08:01.781 --> 08:02.915
Marcus?

08:03.017 --> 08:04.017
No, it's not Marcus.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.321
Oh my God, Ben forgot his phone.

08:09.890 --> 08:12.558
So... so here's what we're gonna do.

08:12.659 --> 08:13.826
I'll call down to the bar

08:13.927 --> 08:15.161
and tell him that it's here

08:15.262 --> 08:16.329
and he'll come rushing back up.

08:16.430 --> 08:17.696
The minute he walks through the door,

08:17.797 --> 08:19.998
<i>we'll put Emma down and voila!</i>

08:20.099 --> 08:21.566
First steps taken.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.001
Thank me very much.

08:24.904 --> 08:25.837
Oh my God, Riley!

08:25.938 --> 08:27.472
Oh, thank you. Thought I lost my phone.

08:27.573 --> 08:28.907
- All right, see you guys.
- Wait!

08:29.008 --> 08:29.941
Wait, um,

08:30.043 --> 08:31.343
hey, Ben.

08:31.444 --> 08:32.809
Don't you want to say hi

08:32.912 --> 08:34.179
to your little girl?

08:34.280 --> 08:36.280
Uh, okay.

08:37.816 --> 08:38.815
Hi, Baby.

08:40.652 --> 08:41.818
Can I go now?

08:43.988 --> 08:45.956
- (Groans)
- I told you!

08:46.058 --> 08:47.558
She had a limited number.

08:52.620 --> 08:54.754
<i> So you know what all this walking means?
</i>

08:54.855 --> 08:56.555
Bootie shopping spree.

08:56.656 --> 08:57.523
(Mouths)

08:57.624 --> 08:59.091
And speaking of Booty,

08:59.192 --> 09:01.960
I'm gonna need some help
from this little cutie.

09:02.061 --> 09:03.095
(Chuckles)

09:03.196 --> 09:04.497
We've got a play date at the park

09:04.598 --> 09:05.764
with a hot single mom.

09:05.865 --> 09:08.634
Well, put a bonnet on a puppy.

09:08.735 --> 09:10.603
Because there is no way that Emma

09:10.703 --> 09:11.970
is leaving this apartment

09:12.071 --> 09:14.272
until Ben sees her walk.

09:14.373 --> 09:17.242
But this baby is a babe magnet.

09:17.343 --> 09:19.244
And it's not like you all haven't done

09:19.345 --> 09:21.279
the exact same thing.

09:22.814 --> 09:24.482
<i>(Rock music playing)</i>

09:45.770 --> 09:46.736
The point is,

09:46.738 --> 09:48.605
I've only got one girl
in my life right now.

09:49.006 --> 09:51.375
So please, just make
sure she stays as perfect

09:51.476 --> 09:52.576
and healthy as she seems.

09:52.677 --> 09:53.777
Mm.

09:53.778 --> 09:55.746
Well, she's already got
one thing going for her.

09:56.147 --> 09:57.180
She's got you.

10:02.053 --> 10:03.219
Uh, what's this?

10:03.220 --> 10:04.488
My phone number.

10:04.789 --> 10:05.889
Give me a call sometime,

10:05.990 --> 10:07.490
very single Ben.

10:07.591 --> 10:09.192
The doctor will be right in.

10:15.032 --> 10:16.299
Oh, yes!

10:16.400 --> 10:18.634
I just got hit on by a hot baby nurse.

10:18.735 --> 10:20.303
(Chuckles)

10:20.404 --> 10:21.770
We make a good team.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.072
Yes, we do.

10:23.173 --> 10:25.341
Now shove these down your pants.

10:25.442 --> 10:26.709
Oh, no no no, Honey.

10:26.810 --> 10:28.377
I know you like Daddy's phone,

10:28.478 --> 10:29.845
but the last time you baby-dialed someone,

10:29.946 --> 10:30.980
- the police showed up.
- (Chuckles)

10:32.649 --> 10:34.650
Look, you almost called Ava.

10:40.990 --> 10:42.991
You almost called Ava.

10:43.093 --> 10:45.427
Tucker?!

10:45.528 --> 10:48.230
Tuck?

10:48.331 --> 10:49.431
Okay, here's Daddy's phone.

10:49.532 --> 10:51.066
Okay.

10:51.167 --> 10:52.567
If you just hit right here, okay?

10:52.668 --> 10:54.236
Right...

10:54.337 --> 10:56.238
Hold on, right here.

10:56.339 --> 10:57.840
If you just... okay.

10:57.941 --> 10:59.708
Right here. No, Emma.

10:59.808 --> 11:01.343
Focus, okay?

11:01.444 --> 11:03.311
Just... just right there.

11:03.412 --> 11:04.646
(Cellphone beeps)

11:04.747 --> 11:05.880
Yes!

11:05.981 --> 11:08.816
(Line ringing)

11:08.917 --> 11:10.452
<i>- (Beeps)
- Ava: Hello?</i>

11:10.553 --> 11:11.620
(Mouths)

11:11.721 --> 11:13.688
<i>Ava: Ben? Is anybody there?</i>

11:13.789 --> 11:16.291
<i>Hello?</i>

11:16.392 --> 11:18.860
(Phone beeps)

11:18.961 --> 11:21.329
Oh, please please please
please please please please.

11:21.430 --> 11:23.464
(Cellphone vibrates)

11:23.565 --> 11:24.899
<i>Ben: It seems we have a call.</i>

11:25.000 --> 11:26.634
(Chuckles)

11:27.736 --> 11:28.903
Hello?

11:29.004 --> 11:30.671
Ava?

11:30.773 --> 11:32.140
(Giggles)

11:32.241 --> 11:34.041
Oh, yeah. It's so nice of you to call.

11:35.144 --> 11:36.377
You up for a little challenge?

11:36.478 --> 11:37.478
I'm listening.

11:37.579 --> 11:38.746
We each take a block.

11:38.847 --> 11:40.047
Whoever lands the most numbers

11:40.149 --> 11:41.915
gets the stroller the
whole rest of the day.

11:42.016 --> 11:43.650
Game on. But I gotta warn you.

11:43.751 --> 11:45.152
Tucker's in the zone.

11:45.253 --> 11:47.353
Thanks for the heads up, Frunkle.

11:47.454 --> 11:48.989
I'll take this block.

11:49.090 --> 11:50.456
Wait wait wait wait.
You get the Yogurt Shop

11:50.557 --> 11:51.524
and the Nail Salon?

11:51.625 --> 11:55.128
Whoo! Is it ever hot out today.

11:55.229 --> 11:56.629
Hey, hey...

11:56.730 --> 11:58.331
That is not fair.

11:58.432 --> 11:59.666
Hey!

11:59.767 --> 12:01.267
I want to renegotiate.

12:01.367 --> 12:03.002
Okay, Emma.

12:03.103 --> 12:04.804
Are you ready to be Grandma's wing-baby?

12:04.905 --> 12:07.339
I have decided that today is the day

12:07.440 --> 12:09.474
I'm finally gonna talk to the hottest guy

12:09.575 --> 12:12.044
this side... Hello!

12:12.145 --> 12:14.113
There he is.

12:14.214 --> 12:15.480
Now remember,

12:15.581 --> 12:17.249
I get the one who's potty-trained.

12:20.519 --> 12:22.320
Did you see that look?

12:22.421 --> 12:23.654
Oh!

12:23.755 --> 12:26.291
Why did I only shave up
to my knees this morning?

12:27.827 --> 12:29.260
Now watch and learn, Emma.

12:29.361 --> 12:31.629
First impressions are everything.

12:31.730 --> 12:34.098
Excuse me, is this seat available?

12:34.200 --> 12:35.233
Sure is.

12:39.437 --> 12:42.206
Just like the woman sitting across from it.

12:42.307 --> 12:43.540
Here here here. Just hold her.

12:43.641 --> 12:46.009
10 seconds and I'll give
you back the earring.

12:46.110 --> 12:49.112
Come on. Come on.

12:49.214 --> 12:51.781
There you go.

12:51.883 --> 12:53.083
Yeah.

12:53.184 --> 12:54.318
Aww.

12:54.418 --> 12:55.652
She's awfully cute.

12:55.753 --> 12:57.187
- (Spits)
- (Shrieks)

12:57.288 --> 12:59.322
(Gasps, groans)

12:59.422 --> 13:00.656
Ugh!

13:00.757 --> 13:02.058
Here.

13:02.159 --> 13:04.426
Your baby's broken.

13:04.527 --> 13:08.097
Because right next to that is
a Korean foot massage place.

13:08.198 --> 13:10.599
Oh my God. I love a good foot massage.

13:10.700 --> 13:12.601
Oh, well then you should go there.

13:12.702 --> 13:14.670
Or... oh look, I have hands.

13:14.771 --> 13:16.672
(Both laugh)

13:16.773 --> 13:18.807
How could somebody so funny and sweet

13:18.908 --> 13:21.610
end up with a roommate
that's such a wack-a-doodle?

13:21.711 --> 13:23.278
(Chuckles)

13:23.380 --> 13:24.413
Hey, let's be honest.

13:24.414 --> 13:26.348
If I didn't take him in, then who would?

13:26.349 --> 13:27.416
(Chuckles)

13:27.517 --> 13:29.050
Well, you and your hands stay put.

13:29.151 --> 13:30.753
I'm just gonna go check on Justin.

13:30.854 --> 13:32.120
We will be right here.

13:32.221 --> 13:33.555
(Chuckles)

13:48.103 --> 13:49.370
(Bleats)

13:55.076 --> 13:56.210
What are you doing?

13:57.745 --> 13:58.678
Nothing.

13:58.780 --> 14:00.480
Tucker?

14:00.581 --> 14:01.915
Um...

14:07.288 --> 14:08.955
(Bleats)

14:10.425 --> 14:14.060
Seriously, world's best wing-baby.

14:14.161 --> 14:15.662
Wait, what are we gonna do

14:15.763 --> 14:17.397
when she actually learns how to say no?

14:17.498 --> 14:20.332
Like every other woman in your life?

14:20.434 --> 14:22.134
Oh, yeah!

14:22.235 --> 14:23.602
(Chuckles)

14:23.703 --> 14:25.805
Besides, she's a wheeler.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.306
She can be bought.

14:27.407 --> 14:30.108
At least that's what your personal ad says.

14:31.311 --> 14:32.411
Fine.

14:32.512 --> 14:34.980
Fine, I will just get
a high five from Emma.

14:35.081 --> 14:36.515
Emma? Where's Emma?

14:36.616 --> 14:38.182
(Door closes)

14:38.283 --> 14:39.250
Riley: Oh my God.

14:39.351 --> 14:40.919
- Oh my God.
- No no no no!

14:41.019 --> 14:42.854
(All muttering)

14:42.955 --> 14:44.288
All: Emma? Emma?

14:45.796 --> 14:48.430
<i>I remember the first time Ben
locked himself in the bathroom.</i>

14:48.431 --> 14:51.533
Of course it was for a
very different reason.

14:52.568 --> 14:54.469
It just makes me realize
all these milestones

14:54.570 --> 14:56.405
are going by so fast.

14:56.505 --> 14:58.173
- Huh?
- (Coos)

14:59.542 --> 15:00.675
What do you think, Emma?

15:00.776 --> 15:02.877
This is what we call a party.

15:02.978 --> 15:04.646
Someday, you'll grow up

15:04.747 --> 15:07.415
and trash Daddy's place, and the
circle of life will be complete.

15:09.151 --> 15:11.486
I'm actually getting kind of
teary-eyed just thinking about it.

15:11.587 --> 15:14.188
I need you to focus. This is
a critical birthday decision.

15:14.289 --> 15:15.890
Traditional?

15:17.426 --> 15:18.460
Tiara?

15:18.561 --> 15:20.328
All: Aww.

15:20.429 --> 15:21.562
Ben: Oh, no.

15:21.663 --> 15:23.897
Or my personal favorite,

15:23.998 --> 15:25.398
viking warrior Princess.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.701
All: Warrior Princess.

15:29.070 --> 15:30.737
Oh, and also, can we please vote

15:30.839 --> 15:32.272
on whether or not we're getting a pony?

15:32.373 --> 15:34.808
I still think we can
fit one in the elevator.

15:34.909 --> 15:37.377
Well, I measured.

15:37.479 --> 15:40.046
And we can totally fit
a pony in that elevator.

15:40.147 --> 15:41.181
Yes!

15:42.850 --> 15:44.184
I don't know which one you are,

15:44.285 --> 15:47.020
but you're definitely the
cutest reindeer of them all.

15:47.121 --> 15:48.955
When did I become one of those parents?

15:50.624 --> 15:53.493
Probably two seconds after I
saw you in those little antlers.

15:53.594 --> 15:57.063
I can't believe we have been
waiting almost three hours.

15:57.164 --> 15:59.132
At this rate, they should
just pass out easter eggs

15:59.233 --> 16:00.467
and call it a twofer.

16:00.567 --> 16:02.801
I'm sorry, but who knew

16:02.902 --> 16:04.203
so many people would want to see Santa

16:04.304 --> 16:05.704
two days before Christmas?

16:05.805 --> 16:07.706
Everyone.

16:07.807 --> 16:09.774
Yeah, well, I just wish
I didn't wait until now

16:09.876 --> 16:10.876
to get Emma's present.

16:10.977 --> 16:13.912
Who knew they'd already be sold out?

16:14.014 --> 16:16.448
Again, I'm gonna go with everyone.

16:16.549 --> 16:18.050
Now what am I gonna do?

16:18.151 --> 16:19.751
I have to get Emma that Giggorilla.

16:19.752 --> 16:21.119
She loves that laughing ape.

16:21.220 --> 16:22.721
She told me so with her smile.

16:22.822 --> 16:24.188
Well, you do know there's a good chance

16:24.289 --> 16:25.957
that smile was just gas, right?

16:26.959 --> 16:28.259
You're next.

16:28.360 --> 16:30.729
If anyone feels the need to spit up,

16:30.830 --> 16:32.397
tear up, or hiccup,

16:32.498 --> 16:34.499
I'd appreciate a heads-up.

16:36.168 --> 16:38.069
Well, I'd appreciate a "hurry up."

16:38.170 --> 16:41.539
Because I got a turkey I need to pick up.

16:41.640 --> 16:43.607
Well, here's how it's gonna go down.

16:43.708 --> 16:44.942
He "Ho-Ho" 's,

16:45.043 --> 16:46.176
you tell him what you want,

16:46.277 --> 16:47.411
we snap a picture,

16:47.512 --> 16:49.413
and then if you'd like
to make another memory,

16:49.514 --> 16:52.282
meet me in 20 minutes
in the Gingerbread House.

16:56.888 --> 16:58.922
I might have to fold you in half,

16:59.023 --> 17:01.223
but I think I can get it done.

17:02.826 --> 17:05.161
Best offer I've had all week.

17:05.262 --> 17:07.829
Okay, folks. Let's do this.

17:07.932 --> 17:10.499
So, I'd like to call on
Emma's two amazing godfathers.

17:10.601 --> 17:11.768
- Ready to go, dude.
- We're on it.

17:11.868 --> 17:13.202
Her one incredible godmother.

17:13.303 --> 17:14.270
That's me.

17:14.371 --> 17:16.973
Her two one-of-a-kind
grandparents.

17:17.074 --> 17:18.973
- Oh, we love you.
- Yes, we do.

17:19.075 --> 17:20.642
We love you.

17:20.742 --> 17:23.511
And hopefully a new step-granddad.

17:23.613 --> 17:25.480
Hey, baby girl.

17:25.582 --> 17:28.450
So, we're gathered here to make a promise.

17:28.550 --> 17:30.385
That we will always watch over her,

17:30.486 --> 17:32.187
and make sure that she's always loved

17:32.288 --> 17:34.056
and happy and protected.

17:34.156 --> 17:36.058
And that she knows that she's
never alone in this world.

17:37.426 --> 17:39.393
We may be loud and crazy

17:39.494 --> 17:42.529
and anything but a typical,
normal American family,

17:42.631 --> 17:45.499
but we will always be there for you.

17:45.601 --> 17:46.634
Danny?

17:48.303 --> 17:49.269
Here we go.

17:49.370 --> 17:50.270
Here you go.

17:50.371 --> 17:52.372
Here we go, Emma.

17:52.474 --> 17:53.708
Ohh.

17:53.809 --> 17:54.942
All: Ohh!

17:55.043 --> 17:56.677
Okay, Emma.

17:56.778 --> 17:58.979
And just remember,
whenever you need a moral

17:59.080 --> 18:00.380
or spiritual guide...

18:00.482 --> 18:01.582
You just come to me.

18:01.682 --> 18:02.916
- What?
- No, she would come to me.

18:03.017 --> 18:04.585
- I'm her grandmother.
- No no.

18:04.685 --> 18:06.686
(Overlapping arguing)

18:09.957 --> 18:12.058
We love you, Emma.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.560
- Go!
- All right, here we go.

18:14.695 --> 18:16.329
Hakuna Matata! "The Lion King."

18:16.430 --> 18:17.463
Yes!

18:21.335 --> 18:22.901
"Nobody puts Baby in the corner".

18:23.003 --> 18:24.970
- "Dirty Dancing."
- Yes!

18:25.071 --> 18:27.540
- Uh...
- (Growling)

18:27.641 --> 18:29.041
- (In Australian accent)
- A dingo ate my baby!

18:29.143 --> 18:30.075
"A Cry in the Dark."

18:30.177 --> 18:31.477
Yes! Five seconds!

18:31.578 --> 18:32.578
Five seconds!

18:34.014 --> 18:35.713
<i>Hasta la vista, Baby.</i>

18:35.814 --> 18:37.215
"Terminator 2."

18:37.316 --> 18:38.750
- Yes!
- What?!

18:38.851 --> 18:40.652
That is time!

18:40.753 --> 18:42.187
(Cries)

18:42.288 --> 18:43.188
Come on, you have to eat.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.190
I'm begging you.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.658
Come on.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.800
(Emma coos)

18:58.804 --> 19:00.337
(Giggles)

19:03.475 --> 19:04.708
What?

19:04.809 --> 19:07.311
You like that?

19:07.412 --> 19:09.513
Look what Daddy can do.

19:09.614 --> 19:10.847
Huh?

19:10.948 --> 19:12.849
I do this at work every day.

19:12.950 --> 19:14.185
Huh?

19:14.286 --> 19:15.386
You want some now?

19:15.487 --> 19:16.720
You want some?

19:16.821 --> 19:18.222
Here it comes.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.657
Here it comes, baby.

19:21.826 --> 19:23.160
(Chuckles)

19:23.261 --> 19:25.396
Oh my God, you're eating.

19:25.497 --> 19:27.897
Thank you so much.

19:27.998 --> 19:29.832
Okay people, let's do this.

19:29.933 --> 19:32.101
- Hi, Sweetie.
- Where's the cake?

19:35.105 --> 19:36.138
Oh.

19:36.240 --> 19:37.139
Was this for Emma?

19:37.241 --> 19:38.808
Well, Baby,

19:38.909 --> 19:41.143
maybe this isn't what you signed up for,

19:41.245 --> 19:42.645
but you're stuck with us.

19:44.081 --> 19:46.449
All: Happy Birthday, Emma.

19:48.618 --> 19:50.319
It's him. Everybody act natural.

19:50.420 --> 19:51.921
Okay, um...

19:52.022 --> 19:52.955
(All stammering)

19:53.056 --> 19:54.389
Move it, move it, move it.

19:55.892 --> 19:57.727
Oh, hey.

19:57.828 --> 19:58.761
You guys are still here.

19:58.862 --> 20:00.229
Way to be productive.

20:00.330 --> 20:01.563
Hey, Ben.

20:01.664 --> 20:03.733
I'm just making coffee.

20:03.834 --> 20:05.901
And I'm cooking a meal.

20:06.002 --> 20:08.436
And I'm... leaning.

20:08.537 --> 20:10.739
And I'm carting your baby around

20:10.840 --> 20:12.406
because she doesn't know how to walk yet.

20:12.507 --> 20:14.743
Oh, good. So I didn't miss anything?

20:14.844 --> 20:16.410
Hey, Emma.

20:16.511 --> 20:18.346
Don't you want to walk for Daddy?

20:20.249 --> 20:22.050
Oh my God, Emma.

20:22.151 --> 20:24.119
Did you guys just see that? Emma walked!

20:24.220 --> 20:26.486
- That's amazing.
- Really?

20:26.587 --> 20:28.889
I can't believe my little
girl's all grown up.

20:30.524 --> 20:31.792
I know these are your first steps,

20:31.893 --> 20:33.526
and they're gonna take you
out there in this world,

20:33.628 --> 20:35.695
but just remember,

20:35.797 --> 20:37.364
no matter where you go,

20:37.465 --> 20:39.332
Daddy's always gonna be right here.
