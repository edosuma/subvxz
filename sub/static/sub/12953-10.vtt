00:18.605 --> 00:20.692
Do you have a problem with all holidays?

00:20.786 --> 00:21.162
No.

00:21.254 --> 00:23.153
So you're fine with, let's say, Arbor Day?

00:23.244 --> 00:24.809
I'm not that into celebrating, that's all.

00:24.901 --> 00:26.704
- That's all? It's --
- What's going on?

00:26.750 --> 00:29.125
Your sister doesn't want to celebrate her own birthday.

00:29.171 --> 00:29.972
When?

00:30.064 --> 00:31.629
In two days -- you don't know about this either?

00:31.721 --> 00:32.502
Get out!

00:32.548 --> 00:34.303
I don't even know if it is my birthday.

00:34.440 --> 00:36.140
In the orphanage, they just felt bad

00:36.240 --> 00:38.520
because I was the only kid who didn't know when I was born.

00:38.610 --> 00:39.980
So the sisters just picked a date.

00:40.080 --> 00:40.881
Yeah, day after tomorrow.

00:40.973 --> 00:42.157
We could go bowling and rent some lanes.

00:42.250 --> 00:43.288
We've been through bowling.

00:43.380 --> 00:45.803
Go-carts, though, could be really good.

00:45.895 --> 00:46.792
Bar hopping.

00:46.884 --> 00:48.638
Bar hopping, or a ragin' house party.

00:48.778 --> 00:49.830
Whoo! What's up?

00:49.923 --> 00:52.298
Thank you, but I don't want to do anything.

00:52.392 --> 00:53.573
- Come on.
- Hey, guys.

00:53.853 --> 00:55.131
Are you guys planning a party?

00:55.223 --> 00:56.071
There's no party.

00:56.163 --> 00:59.112
'Cause I'm a really good DJ, if you need, uh...

00:59.718 --> 01:00.758
Anyway, speaking of parties,

01:00.803 --> 01:03.319
Sloane's having one in the briefing room now.

01:04.458 --> 01:08.028
As most of you know, when the Alliance was dismantled four years ago,

01:08.103 --> 01:10.954
the CIA came into possession of a multitude of artifacts,

01:11.047 --> 01:12.420
files, and intels.

01:12.840 --> 01:16.055
Among the items retrieved was the Blackwell index.

01:16.149 --> 01:18.569
Blackwell? What is this, a worst-dressed list?

01:18.664 --> 01:20.801
Damien Blackwell, head of the Gouse Crime Syndicate.

01:20.892 --> 01:23.458
He's believed to have compiled incriminating information

01:23.550 --> 01:25.209
on corporate heads, government officials,

01:25.349 --> 01:28.439
common criminals -- essentially a master blackmail list

01:28.532 --> 01:30.477
encoded into a mobile terminal.

01:32.531 --> 01:34.333
The Alliance was never able to read the index

01:34.426 --> 01:36.132
during the six months it was in their possession.

01:36.225 --> 01:39.267
It was inciphered using 4,096-bit encryption.

01:39.360 --> 01:42.193
Wow. I mean, even with current technology,

01:42.285 --> 01:44.278
that would take like 20 years to decipher,

01:44.325 --> 01:47.224
and that's with a supercomputer working on it 24/7.

01:47.270 --> 01:51.219
Needless to say, the CIA was unsuccessful in its decryption efforts.

01:51.311 --> 01:52.588
Why is this an issue now?

01:52.664 --> 01:56.088
Last night the index was stolen from the CIA research station in Sarajevo.

02:01.411 --> 02:03.260
Left three of our analysts dead.

02:04.193 --> 02:05.614
No leads on who stole it?

02:05.707 --> 02:08.414
No, it was a clean job. In and out within two minutes.

02:09.300 --> 02:10.817
Why steal something you can't read?

02:10.910 --> 02:12.617
The decoder disk has been located.

02:12.802 --> 02:16.226
Two weeks ago, Damien Blackwell's concealed base of operation

02:16.272 --> 02:18.885
was identified and raided by french authorities.

02:19.024 --> 02:21.684
They seized most of his possessions as evidence,

02:21.823 --> 02:23.483
including a mini disk.

02:23.947 --> 02:25.989
We believe this to be the decoder.

02:26.081 --> 02:28.551
Our only logical recourse is to go after the decoder.

02:28.643 --> 02:30.302
Without it, the index is useless.

02:30.441 --> 02:31.434
Do the french know what they have?

02:31.526 --> 02:35.188
No. Of course we would rather obtain it through legal channels.

02:35.281 --> 02:37.512
Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be an option right now.

02:37.605 --> 02:40.028
Wait a minute. You want us to steal the decoder from french police?

02:40.167 --> 02:42.351
Right now it's being housed in the Paris prefecture.

02:42.489 --> 02:44.864
Sydney, figure out a way to get yourself arrested.

03:21.246 --> 03:23.046
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:23.141 --> 03:25.800
We got out of the briefing early. Did Sloane approve your trip?

03:25.892 --> 03:26.361
Mm-hmm.

03:26.454 --> 03:27.637
Any word on your uncle?

03:28.850 --> 03:30.366
Yeah, I spoke to my mom this morning.

03:30.459 --> 03:32.117
Apparently this last stroke hit him pretty hard.

03:32.209 --> 03:33.631
He hasn't regained consciousness.

03:34.003 --> 03:35.329
- That's awful.
- Yeah.

03:37.007 --> 03:38.523
Are you gonna be okay?

03:38.569 --> 03:39.420
Yeah. I'm fine.

03:40.958 --> 03:42.283
It's just that, you know, when my dad died,

03:42.329 --> 03:44.226
my uncle made all these promises about

03:44.318 --> 03:47.695
being there for me and my mother, and he wasn't -- ever.

03:49.374 --> 03:52.607
I'm not sure how I feel about seeing him again, you know.

03:56.063 --> 03:57.721
I wish I could go with you.

03:59.261 --> 04:00.839
I know.

04:06.026 --> 04:07.645
I'll call you when I land.

04:08.251 --> 04:09.460
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:18.332 --> 04:19.399
Sydney.

04:21.548 --> 04:22.634
We need to talk.

04:29.967 --> 04:32.246
Okay, it's safe to talk here.

04:32.897 --> 04:33.507
Okay.

04:33.834 --> 04:35.588
I've been cross-checking Sloane's facts,

04:35.681 --> 04:37.150
vetting the intel he's given us.

04:38.456 --> 04:40.592
Director chase encouraged us to watch Sloane.

04:40.685 --> 04:41.962
That's what I've been doing.

04:42.521 --> 04:44.896
I'm not going to make the same mistake I did at SD-6,

04:44.989 --> 04:47.172
blindly following that man's orders.

04:47.639 --> 04:49.726
What has he done now?

04:50.519 --> 04:53.037
Sloane just said he had no leads

04:53.084 --> 04:56.601
on who stole the index out of that research station in Sarajevo.

04:56.694 --> 04:57.256
Yeah?

04:59.123 --> 05:00.497
Look familiar?

05:01.010 --> 05:04.911
Miles Devereaux, former Alliance member. Head of operations, SD-3.

05:05.004 --> 05:10.048
Sloane contacted him. 40 minutes after the Blackwell index was stolen.

05:10.141 --> 05:11.943
Before  Langley had even discovered the theft.

05:12.035 --> 05:12.838
How do you know?

05:13.303 --> 05:16.488
I've got a tap on Sloane's home line.

05:16.582 --> 05:17.049
Dixon --

05:17.142 --> 05:21.187
The call was encrypted, but I traced it to a hotel in Sarajevo.

05:21.326 --> 05:23.272
I hacked into the hotel's CCTV feed.

05:23.364 --> 05:24.976
That's where I found this.

05:27.216 --> 05:29.209
You think Sloane is working with Devereaux?

05:29.255 --> 05:32.612
I think Sloane tasked us to steal the decoder for one reason --

05:32.798 --> 05:35.078
so he and Devereaux could crack the index

05:35.169 --> 05:37.496
and  retrieve the blackmail files for themselves.

05:37.590 --> 05:39.868
That's why he lied about having no leads.

05:40.940 --> 05:43.316
He's using us...

05:43.735 --> 05:44.822
again.

05:46.736 --> 05:51.017
And that's not something I'm gonna let him do.

06:25.873 --> 06:27.005
So what you're telling me

06:27.099 --> 06:30.190
is that you've been illegally tapping your superior's phone.

06:30.283 --> 06:32.990
Keeping an eye on Sloane was a mandate,

06:33.176 --> 06:35.694
one that you specifically charged me with.

06:36.440 --> 06:39.053
I didn't condone breaking federal laws to do it.

06:39.146 --> 06:42.695
Since SD-6, Sloane has wanted he Blackwell index.

06:43.067 --> 06:45.155
And now he's coincidentally made contact

06:45.201 --> 06:48.482
with Devereaux in Sarajevo minutes after the theft?

06:48.575 --> 06:50.806
Perhaps he's pursuing information on who stole it.

06:50.899 --> 06:52.559
By contacting a former Alliance member?

06:52.697 --> 06:54.785
Sloane is free to contact old associates.

06:54.878 --> 06:57.778
It's one of the reasons why he was appointed head of the task force.

06:57.916 --> 07:00.291
He lied to us about having no leads.

07:00.431 --> 07:02.757
Perhaps none of the leads proved useful.

07:05.138 --> 07:06.988
Irrational explanations.

07:07.733 --> 07:10.777
He tasked us to steal the decoder from police custody.

07:10.962 --> 07:13.431
Does this add up for you? Are you listening to me?

07:13.711 --> 07:16.418
I'm aware of the mission to retrieve the decoder, mr. Dixon.

07:16.464 --> 07:18.220
I authorized it myself.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.210
Now I appreciate your concern,

07:20.349 --> 07:23.087
but these accusations are based on circumstantial evidence,

07:23.162 --> 07:25.299
so unless you have something else to give me,

07:25.392 --> 07:28.911
I would suggest you pull that phone tap.

07:30.544 --> 07:33.585
I know you want him to be guilty. I've been there.

07:33.865 --> 07:35.571
This is not about what he did to Diane.

07:35.664 --> 07:36.941
Of course it is.

07:37.454 --> 07:38.923
It is for me.

07:39.557 --> 07:42.550
But you're the one who reminded me why we're here --

07:42.875 --> 07:44.344
to do the right thing.

07:45.550 --> 07:47.880
Maybe this time director Chase is right.

07:49.050 --> 07:51.040
Maybe we should just let it go.

07:51.230 --> 07:53.460
Chase refuses to see the truth.

07:54.301 --> 07:58.595
Sydney, you know I never do this. I'm asking you for me.

07:58.887 --> 08:02.862
Please, I need your help.

08:21.449 --> 08:23.586
You don't have to stand in the dark, you know.

08:23.819 --> 08:26.240
Oh, uh, I didn't want to, uh...

08:26.332 --> 08:28.706
The light won't bother David.

08:29.639 --> 08:30.821
You must be Bill.

08:32.782 --> 08:33.868
Why would you say that?

08:33.914 --> 08:35.525
Your uncle said you were coming to see him.

08:35.664 --> 08:38.356
He used to talk about you a lot before he had the stroke.

08:38.448 --> 08:40.822
Bill was my father. He's dead.

08:40.914 --> 08:42.765
Oh. My mistake.

08:43.977 --> 08:46.496
Older people get confused sometimes, you know,

08:46.589 --> 08:49.297
and they get the past and the present mixed up.

08:50.184 --> 08:54.131
- Was it recent?
- No, he died in 1979.

08:54.971 --> 08:58.586
- I'm Michael.
- I'm Rosemary.

08:58.913 --> 08:59.855
Nice to meet you.

08:59.901 --> 09:02.418
I do the 3:00 and the 10:00 rounds in this wing.

09:02.512 --> 09:03.360
Did you come a long way?

09:03.453 --> 09:06.637
Los Angeles. I would have come to visit sooner, but...

09:07.570 --> 09:10.041
Well, you're here now.

09:11.206 --> 09:13.104
That's what's important.

09:18.847 --> 09:20.602
I reviewed your recon analysis report.

09:20.742 --> 09:22.639
Your extraction plan needs some work.

09:23.059 --> 09:24.097
Really? I thought --

09:24.190 --> 09:25.945
You're assuming that everything is going right.

09:26.038 --> 09:27.412
No, I allowed for contingencies.

09:27.505 --> 09:29.355
Exiting the building, if anything happens,

09:29.493 --> 09:31.725
it's the perimeter that poses the greatest problem.

09:31.819 --> 09:33.142
Okay, I'll work up a new scenario.

09:33.236 --> 09:35.848
Good. You have all our resources at your disposal, Weiss.

09:35.940 --> 09:37.027
Why don't you use them?

09:37.121 --> 09:39.876
The last thing we need is an international incident.

09:39.969 --> 09:40.627
Yes, sir.

09:40.719 --> 09:42.140
Rest of the specs look great.

09:42.233 --> 09:42.985
Well, thank you.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.500
I take it you'll have no problem bringing Nadia up to speed.

09:45.593 --> 09:47.537
Yeah. I already did last night.

09:48.331 --> 09:49.608
Excuse me?

09:50.586 --> 09:54.250
Uh, we were working. We work late. We actually like it.

09:54.344 --> 09:55.859
There were other peop-- Jack was here.

09:55.953 --> 09:57.039
Are you finished?

09:57.225 --> 09:59.027
Have the report on my desk in an hour.

09:59.633 --> 10:00.624
Impress me.

10:06.881 --> 10:09.018
Jack, I didn't realize you were waiting.

10:11.819 --> 10:14.098
I heard the forensic reports from Sarajevo were in.

10:14.237 --> 10:16.754
I'm curious -- was Langley able to generate any new leads?

10:16.800 --> 10:17.697
No.

10:17.976 --> 10:20.588
They have nothing as far as the theft is concerned.

10:21.102 --> 10:22.998
Then I'm assuming our agenda remains the same.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.132
Oh, yes. We obtain the decoder.

10:25.271 --> 10:26.835
I'll coordinate transport now.

10:27.114 --> 10:28.678
Jack, one more thing.

10:28.817 --> 10:32.146
Sydney was supposed to hand me her ops report 15 minutes ago.

10:32.471 --> 10:34.750
Any  idea where she might be?

10:35.075 --> 10:38.880
No. I imagine she's somewhere working out the details.

10:41.168 --> 10:43.065
I used to meet Vaughn like this

10:43.203 --> 10:45.435
when he was my handler at SD-6.

10:46.136 --> 10:47.603
Must have been romantic.

10:50.123 --> 10:51.640
Micro CD burner.

10:51.919 --> 10:52.720
Where'd you get it?

10:52.812 --> 10:54.805
I borrowed it from Marshall's office.

10:54.945 --> 10:55.984
With a few adjustments,

10:56.077 --> 10:58.308
it'll make a corrupted copy of the decoder disk.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.919
That'll be what we give to Sloane. Keep the real one safe.

11:01.057 --> 11:03.718
So if Sloane follows protocol and hands it over to the CIA...

11:03.857 --> 11:06.833
No harm done. But if he tries using it, he'll be sorely disappointed.

11:07.017 --> 11:09.059
We'll have to watch and see.

11:13.821 --> 11:14.622
What?

11:15.322 --> 11:19.555
I'm just now realizing how complicated your life was at SD-6.

11:21.142 --> 11:23.230
I appreciate you doing this.

11:23.836 --> 11:25.782
I know you have your reservations.

11:27.837 --> 11:31.497
It's just that things are a little different now since Nadia.

11:31.964 --> 11:33.127
He's her father.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.832
I know this may seem weird,

11:39.605 --> 11:42.314
but I hope for her sake that we're wrong.

12:40.557 --> 12:41.931
You're under arrest.

12:56.622 --> 12:57.996
It's about time.

12:58.180 --> 12:59.697
Amanda Peterson, right?

13:00.723 --> 13:03.480
My name is Richard Zachary, your legal counsel

13:03.665 --> 13:05.706
appointed by the american embassy.

13:05.752 --> 13:06.486
Great.

13:07.044 --> 13:10.564
I see you've been enjoying your stay in Paris.

13:10.749 --> 13:11.884
It's been swell.

13:20.011 --> 13:21.096
Okay, got it.

13:21.188 --> 13:23.848
Outrigger, looping the feed on your call.

13:23.939 --> 13:29.225
Vandalism, resisting arrest, assaulting an officer.

13:29.598 --> 13:30.970
These are serious charges.

13:31.064 --> 13:31.626
So?

13:31.718 --> 13:34.808
So let's see about getting you out of here.

13:40.739 --> 13:43.113
- The CD burner.
- Thanks, Dixon.

13:43.208 --> 13:43.865
Good luck.

13:49.796 --> 13:50.833
Phoenix signing in.

13:50.926 --> 13:53.159
Copy. We have you. It's the third door on the left.

14:01.376 --> 14:03.369
Make it quick. You're about to have company.

14:11.122 --> 14:11.873
I'm in.

14:12.012 --> 14:14.007
Okay, plot number 430.

14:42.259 --> 14:44.205
Phoenix, report. Did you get the decoder?

14:44.298 --> 14:49.296
Negative. Moving to check the rest of the inventory.

14:56.674 --> 14:58.332
Phoenix, we lost visual.

14:59.388 --> 15:00.856
Still searching for the decoder.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.299
Phoenix, you've got incoming.

15:03.345 --> 15:05.241
Get out of there now.

15:06.529 --> 15:09.094
Okay. I just found the disk.

15:16.821 --> 15:19.348
Outrigger, abort. Go to plan "B."

15:20.701 --> 15:21.789
Copy that.

15:21.881 --> 15:23.635
Phoenix, we're moving to alternate extraction.

15:23.727 --> 15:25.721
Get to the roof immediately.

15:42.395 --> 15:44.960
Base, plan "b" better be in effect!

16:13.123 --> 16:14.256
I checked with Marshall.

16:14.350 --> 16:15.865
The decoder's still in analysis.

16:15.959 --> 16:17.235
Sloane's following protocol.

16:17.327 --> 16:19.512
No. Since we got back from Paris,

16:19.605 --> 16:22.217
he's made more than a dozen calls from a secure line in his home.

16:22.311 --> 16:23.541
Were you able to trace the calls?

16:23.681 --> 16:25.054
They were routed through relay stations,

16:25.146 --> 16:27.473
but I narrowed them down to a number in Brussels.

16:27.567 --> 16:30.398
Syd, we need to get into Sloane's house.

16:31.050 --> 16:33.329
If we could copy the encryption key from his secure phone,

16:33.376 --> 16:36.179
we could crack the calls to gain access to his conversations.

16:36.271 --> 16:37.265
Yeah, but how?

16:39.038 --> 16:40.886
Sydney, a word.

16:42.568 --> 16:43.606
My office.

16:47.902 --> 16:50.515
I'm sure I don't have to inform you of the consequences

16:50.607 --> 16:53.029
had either of you been apprehended by the french police.

16:54.010 --> 16:55.430
With all due respect, we weren't.

16:55.522 --> 16:58.469
Sydney, you took a long time in the evidence room.

16:58.654 --> 17:00.075
I assume you read my debrief.

17:00.215 --> 17:02.924
The decoder disk was misfiled. I had to search the rest of the inventory.

17:03.045 --> 17:06.135
During which time, Nadia and Weiss lost visual contact with you.

17:06.275 --> 17:07.075
Was that my fault?

17:07.167 --> 17:09.733
Once you were out of view of the security camera,

17:09.828 --> 17:12.630
you just happened to be able to locate the decoder disk?

17:12.722 --> 17:13.809
That's correct.

17:22.306 --> 17:23.584
Perhaps I shouldn't,

17:25.713 --> 17:28.182
but I expect better from you.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.629
This might not be the best time, but I thought you should know.

17:47.422 --> 17:48.938
Today's Nadia's birthday.

17:49.590 --> 17:51.154
She says she doesn't want to celebrate,

17:51.248 --> 17:53.574
but maybe she'd change her mind if the invitation came from you.

17:53.900 --> 17:56.131
Actually, I didn't know when --

18:01.782 --> 18:03.820
Well, what do you think she might like?

18:04.194 --> 18:05.518
Something simple.

18:07.058 --> 18:08.955
Family dinner, maybe.

18:09.048 --> 18:10.517
At your house.

18:13.085 --> 18:14.505
That's a good idea.

18:15.065 --> 18:15.913
Thank you.

18:32.211 --> 18:34.158
Think your uncle wants to listen to the game?

18:36.771 --> 18:39.671
I don't know, I'm not sure he was much of a basketball fan.

18:40.931 --> 18:42.638
Do you think he can hear it?

18:42.730 --> 18:43.960
Well, you never know.

18:44.099 --> 18:45.377
I've known people to come out of comas,

18:45.470 --> 18:47.034
and when you ask them what did it,

18:47.499 --> 18:50.638
lots of times they say that it was the sound of a loved one's voice

18:50.729 --> 18:52.532
that  guided them back.

18:54.913 --> 18:56.906
Patients' hands get so dry.

18:58.539 --> 19:00.294
Were you and your uncle close?

19:00.807 --> 19:02.132
No, not really.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.740
Didn't see him much at all after my father died.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.825
He must have been a good man, your father.

19:06.273 --> 19:08.503
Sometimes he's all David would talk about.

19:11.305 --> 19:13.298
Oh. You know what?

19:13.763 --> 19:15.947
David was keeping something for him.

19:17.860 --> 19:18.900
For who, my father?

19:18.993 --> 19:20.890
I think so. Maybe he wasn't clear,

19:21.029 --> 19:24.215
but he said it was for Bill when he came back.

19:27.529 --> 19:29.667
I suppose you should have it.

19:53.887 --> 19:55.071
What do you think?

19:59.926 --> 20:01.822
It's pretty. It's perfect, actually.

20:01.916 --> 20:02.763
Thanks.

20:02.857 --> 20:04.612
Sure. You can borrow that necklace anytime.

20:04.844 --> 20:07.009
I don't mean that. Well, that too.

20:07.988 --> 20:10.315
I mean tonight, the party.

20:11.808 --> 20:12.752
Really?

20:13.312 --> 20:17.975
Because you seemed a little annoyed when I told your dad about your birthday.

20:18.067 --> 20:21.300
I was, but the idea of being with family --

20:21.579 --> 20:23.286
it feels better than I thought.

20:25.153 --> 20:26.716
I'm so glad you didn't listen.

20:26.949 --> 20:28.082
I usually don't.

20:29.671 --> 20:32.713
You know, the fact that you're even willing to have dinner with my father --

20:32.805 --> 20:34.560
it means so much.

20:36.101 --> 20:37.520
I'm glad.

20:39.154 --> 20:40.385
I'll get my coat.

20:50.096 --> 20:52.520
I'm telling you, she was crazy in Paris.

20:52.892 --> 20:55.123
I'm not kidding. I'm thinking about making my next car a hybrid.

20:55.215 --> 20:57.162
You should. I have one.

20:58.281 --> 20:59.797
What do you think, Arvin?

21:05.727 --> 21:07.577
Uh, Mr. Sloane. Ahem.

21:08.276 --> 21:10.984
Well, considering the rapidly growing demand for fuel

21:11.076 --> 21:12.784
in nations like China and India,

21:12.877 --> 21:16.396
not to mention the world's oil production is expected to peak

21:16.488 --> 21:19.292
in the next five years and then sharply plummet,

21:19.479 --> 21:22.378
I think it's pretty clear we're looking at an exponential rise

21:22.797 --> 21:24.504
in global conflict,

21:24.642 --> 21:29.354
along with an energy crisis of unfathomable proportions.

21:33.790 --> 21:37.261
So, yes, I'd say a hybrid is an excellent idea.

21:41.556 --> 21:43.740
That's what I thought.

21:43.833 --> 21:45.587
How about a toast?

21:47.361 --> 21:49.383
The chinese have a saying --

21:49.989 --> 21:52.792
"one joy scatters a thousand griefs."

21:54.146 --> 21:56.805
So it is in that spirit that I wish you, Nadia,

21:57.085 --> 21:59.746
the same joy that you bring to me every day.

22:00.399 --> 22:03.440
I never dreamed that something so precious would come into my life.

22:04.513 --> 22:06.649
Because of you, I am a changed man.

22:12.813 --> 22:15.426
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

22:15.611 --> 22:18.940
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

22:27.112 --> 22:28.055
Hello?

22:28.195 --> 22:30.236
- It's me.
- It's Vaughn.

22:30.329 --> 22:33.847
No, I have a minute. Are you okay? How's your uncle?

22:46.303 --> 22:48.885
Sloane's secure phone should be in his desk.

22:49.118 --> 22:50.585
Okay, Dixon, stand by.

23:28.415 --> 23:30.073
No, no, no, no. Unh-unh. Sit down.

23:30.167 --> 23:30.729
Why?

23:30.868 --> 23:32.527
Because you're not gonna lift a finger on your birthday.

23:32.620 --> 23:33.135
Come on.

23:33.228 --> 23:35.889
Well, I have something for you, so I'm going to get it.

23:41.959 --> 23:43.236
Okay, I'm transmitting now.

23:43.330 --> 23:46.181
Copy. I'm receiving the phone's encryption key.

23:52.438 --> 23:53.571
Transmission good.

24:12.858 --> 24:13.945
Nadia.

24:23.052 --> 24:25.520
Birthday cake's ready.

24:28.397 --> 24:29.245
Okay.

24:46.010 --> 24:46.811
Nadia.

24:47.416 --> 24:48.027
Thank you.

24:52.817 --> 24:53.953
There she is.

24:54.232 --> 24:56.082
- How's Vaughn?
- He's okay.

24:57.295 --> 24:59.621
I think it's hard for him.

24:59.854 --> 25:00.846
It must be.

25:03.040 --> 25:04.222
All right, don't worry.

25:04.315 --> 25:06.975
I made them promise they would not sing to you.

25:07.488 --> 25:08.908
This is a little something I whipped up.

25:09.141 --> 25:13.471
Uh, chocolate icing, chocolate cake, chocolate mousse --

25:13.517 --> 25:15.653
just for you. Happy birthday.

25:17.520 --> 25:19.467
Come on, Nadia, make a wish.

25:29.692 --> 25:30.665
Speech.

25:37.156 --> 25:40.245
I had no idea what to expect from tonight.

25:41.739 --> 25:44.353
I've never celebrated anything with family before.

25:45.798 --> 25:49.556
And, um, I wasn't even sure I wanted to, but...

25:50.629 --> 25:52.575
Sydney insisted.

26:02.101 --> 26:06.193
Now I see what I've been missing all these years.

26:10.113 --> 26:14.539
The chance to know my family for the kind of people they really are.

26:18.556 --> 26:19.499
Hear, hear.

26:21.226 --> 26:22.264
Happy birthday.

26:35.247 --> 26:36.189
You used me!

26:36.283 --> 26:39.087
You wanted to break into my father's office, and you used me to do it!

26:39.179 --> 26:40.505
- Nadia, listen to me --
- No!

26:40.550 --> 26:42.257
Tonight was nothing but a ploy.

26:42.349 --> 26:43.198
That's not true.

26:43.291 --> 26:45.189
You just said you suspected my father.

26:45.281 --> 26:47.894
I do, but for the first time in my life,

26:48.125 --> 26:49.928
I don't want him to be guilty.

26:50.300 --> 26:53.104
Nadia, I was trying to prove that he's innocent.

27:01.649 --> 27:03.166
Hi. Is Sydney home?

27:03.258 --> 27:05.536
Whatever you found out about my father,

27:05.675 --> 27:07.430
I have a right to know.

28:31.962 --> 28:33.146
Quite a coup,

28:33.378 --> 28:35.705
stealing the decoder from police custody.

28:35.797 --> 28:38.743
No less difficult that obtaining the index from the CIA.

28:39.069 --> 28:42.637
It seems we're both blessed with unique talents.

28:42.916 --> 28:44.430
The others have agreed.

28:44.663 --> 28:46.512
They're leaving for Brussels in the morning.

28:46.885 --> 28:50.405
It will be nice to have you back at the table, Arvin.

28:51.478 --> 28:53.613
Sloane is reconstructing the Alliance.

28:54.126 --> 28:55.833
Unless you require more evidence.

28:57.560 --> 28:58.933
You've proved your point.

28:59.072 --> 29:01.160
Do we have any idea where the meeting's taking place?

29:02.186 --> 29:04.515
All we know is what you heard -- Brussels.

29:06.428 --> 29:07.324
All right then.

29:08.957 --> 29:11.857
We'll set up a mobile surveillance, track Sloane to the meeting.

29:11.949 --> 29:13.751
Once he's led us there, we'll move in.

29:14.030 --> 29:15.355
Who else knows about this?

29:15.448 --> 29:17.584
Agents Sydney Bristow and Nadia Santos.

29:18.518 --> 29:20.797
You've involved agent Santos in this matter?

29:20.935 --> 29:23.025
It became necessary to do so,

29:23.722 --> 29:26.861
but she's prepared to accept the truth about her father.

29:29.521 --> 29:31.609
All right then. Let's do it.

29:46.741 --> 29:47.072
I need the report.

29:47.209 --> 29:47.915
Yeah.

29:48.848 --> 29:52.033
I told you, I need the report on my desk by tomorrow.

29:52.080 --> 29:52.737
That's it.

29:53.158 --> 29:55.434
- You wanted to see me?
- Your scarf.

29:56.461 --> 29:57.644
You left this last night.

29:58.063 --> 29:58.816
Thanks.

29:59.749 --> 30:01.121
You seemed like you were in a hurry.

30:02.428 --> 30:03.372
Is everything all right?

30:03.790 --> 30:05.116
Um, yeah. Why?

30:05.957 --> 30:09.331
Last night, I thought I detected some tension between you and your sister.

30:09.425 --> 30:11.227
No, nothing like that.

30:11.785 --> 30:13.160
I was just overwhelmed.

30:14.513 --> 30:17.220
I still have to get used to being around family.

30:18.107 --> 30:20.529
Oh, I see. Okay.

30:21.088 --> 30:22.748
Well, if you ever need to talk,

30:22.887 --> 30:24.974
just know that my door is always open.

30:25.114 --> 30:25.770
Thank you.

30:28.992 --> 30:30.032
Are you going somewhere?

30:30.171 --> 30:31.782
Yeah. Just an overnight.

30:32.622 --> 30:34.615
- Where to?
- Brussels.

30:37.977 --> 30:40.666
- Have a safe trip.
- Thanks.

31:01.823 --> 31:03.243
I should have told you sooner.

31:03.335 --> 31:04.566
You don't need to protect me.

31:06.200 --> 31:07.095
I know that.

31:09.382 --> 31:12.329
It's just it's always been black and white where your father's concerned.

31:12.423 --> 31:13.842
I'm not used to seeing the gray.

31:13.935 --> 31:15.450
What if it was your father?

31:15.591 --> 31:17.678
He's done his share of compromising things.

31:17.939 --> 31:19.742
Would you work this hard to punish him?

31:34.669 --> 31:35.660
Target's on the move.

31:35.754 --> 31:36.698
Is the tracker hot?

31:36.884 --> 31:39.688
He just got onto rue Voltaire, heading due north.

31:41.367 --> 31:43.169
He's turning towards the river.

31:49.754 --> 31:50.792
The dockyards.

32:09.567 --> 32:10.604
Do you have a visual?

32:10.883 --> 32:12.781
Sloane's approaching the building on foot.

32:13.480 --> 32:15.712
Gentlemen, as promised...

32:16.937 --> 32:19.078
the Blackwell index.

32:45.419 --> 32:46.410
He went into the building.

32:46.531 --> 32:47.617
All right, we need to move.

32:47.803 --> 32:49.224
You'll monitor the perimeter.

33:03.094 --> 33:04.133
You're late.

33:17.678 --> 33:18.812
Evergreen, report.

33:19.071 --> 33:20.397
All clear. You have go.

33:44.823 --> 33:46.370
Where's Devereaux? Where is he?

33:46.416 --> 33:47.501
You have no idea what you're doing.

33:47.547 --> 33:48.587
Where's the Alliance meeting?

33:48.679 --> 33:50.462
It's not here. It's in another building.

33:50.649 --> 33:52.289
I am only surveilling.

33:58.594 --> 34:01.348
So, we've heard rumors you've turned CIA.

34:01.534 --> 34:03.385
Rumors were wrong.

34:06.046 --> 34:06.751
Oh, my god.

34:18.284 --> 34:19.228
It's good to be back.

34:26.324 --> 34:27.078
Thank you.

34:27.217 --> 34:29.114
If you knew the Alliance was regrouping,

34:29.208 --> 34:30.580
why not alert the CIA?

34:30.907 --> 34:31.755
You and I both know

34:31.848 --> 34:34.746
that the CIA would never have allowed me to convene the Alliance leadership.

34:34.838 --> 34:36.070
You're damn right.

34:36.208 --> 34:40.443
I had to bait them into the open to I.D. the players, the infrastructure.

34:40.583 --> 34:41.764
You should have come to me.

34:42.772 --> 34:43.764
I went to Jack.

34:43.904 --> 34:45.514
You sent my father to do your dirty work.

34:45.655 --> 34:47.886
Your father demanded to go, Sydney.

34:48.025 --> 34:48.777
He's lying.

34:48.917 --> 34:50.004
No, Marcus, I'm not lying.

34:50.143 --> 34:52.899
Like you, Jack would never trust me around the Blackwell index.

34:52.992 --> 34:56.844
But he knew they would recognize him as my chief of operations at SD-6.

34:57.266 --> 35:00.593
He insisted on delivering the decoder himself.

35:04.795 --> 35:06.215
He doesn't have the real decoder.

35:06.308 --> 35:08.014
Oh, no, you didn't.

35:27.163 --> 35:28.536
What's going on, Jack?

35:34.681 --> 35:36.723
I think the rumors are true.

35:37.096 --> 35:38.898
I think this is a setup.

35:40.577 --> 35:42.189
- Where is he?
- Building 37.

35:44.056 --> 35:45.620
Nadia, get to building 37!

36:04.255 --> 36:05.246
Where's Sloane?

36:06.879 --> 36:07.872
My guess?

36:08.711 --> 36:09.778
Miles from here.

36:11.179 --> 36:12.551
He knew the decoder was a fake.

36:12.690 --> 36:13.777
He sold me out.

36:16.766 --> 36:19.475
And when I find him, I'm going to kill the bastard --

36:21.761 --> 36:24.230
just as soon as I'm done with you.

36:28.901 --> 36:30.035
Where's Sloane?

36:41.430 --> 36:42.614
Where is he?

37:02.976 --> 37:04.015
Jack?

37:31.149 --> 37:31.950
Dad.

37:35.358 --> 37:36.254
I'm okay.

37:37.869 --> 37:38.670
Really.

37:42.872 --> 37:43.912
I'll wait in the car.

37:59.603 --> 38:00.451
Thank you.

38:03.345 --> 38:06.294
I'd like to think in the future you'll do the same for me.

38:26.701 --> 38:28.216
David, it's Michael.

38:31.811 --> 38:33.852
I found it -- dad's diary.

38:34.225 --> 38:37.553
I don't understand. There are entries in here until 1982.

38:37.693 --> 38:40.783
My father died in 1979.

38:40.967 --> 38:43.677
Please, if you can hear me, I need you to wake up.

38:43.768 --> 38:44.952
I need to know.

38:45.091 --> 38:46.989
Have you seen him? Has he been here?

38:49.837 --> 38:51.619
Is he alive?

38:55.587 --> 38:58.629
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize he had a visitor.

38:58.769 --> 38:59.712
Everything okay?

38:59.805 --> 39:01.320
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

39:03.047 --> 39:05.613
Oh, uh, wait. I need to talk to Rosemary.

39:05.984 --> 39:06.928
I'm sorry. Who?

39:07.068 --> 39:10.300
Uh, Rosemary. The nurse. She's been taking care of my uncle.

39:11.374 --> 39:13.032
I don't recognize the name.

39:13.126 --> 39:17.121
What? That's impossible. She covers the 3:00 and 10:00 rounds.

39:17.775 --> 39:21.246
Sir, there are no 3:00 and 10:00 rounds.

39:22.085 --> 39:23.219
I'm sorry.

39:37.882 --> 39:40.830
I trust that you'll remove the tap on Sloane's phone.

39:40.923 --> 39:42.200
Already done.

39:42.247 --> 39:44.240
And the decoder disk. The real one.

39:44.286 --> 39:45.515
It's been turned over.

39:45.840 --> 39:49.171
Good. There's a lot of outside pressure on this task force.

39:49.262 --> 39:50.826
I don't want it compromised from within.

39:50.919 --> 39:51.768
I understand.

39:52.234 --> 39:53.559
You know, Marcus,

39:54.585 --> 39:57.198
when I asked you to keep an eye on Sloane, I meant it.

39:57.291 --> 39:59.045
But there are limits.

39:59.977 --> 40:02.162
That being said, neither Sloane nor I

40:02.254 --> 40:04.915
are pursuing disciplinary actions at this time.

40:06.174 --> 40:07.834
You're an asset to this team.

40:08.999 --> 40:12.281
So if anything else comes up, be sure to call me.

40:12.700 --> 40:17.459
- Anything?
- Within reason.

40:21.568 --> 40:23.132
That looks like it went well.

40:23.646 --> 40:24.589
Yeah.

40:27.716 --> 40:29.088
I'm glad it's over.

40:30.488 --> 40:31.623
Is it?

40:34.471 --> 40:35.510
We'll see.

41:11.097 --> 41:11.783
Yes?

41:12.763 --> 41:13.516
It's working.

41:15.056 --> 41:15.952
Does it have what we need?

41:17.398 --> 41:18.533
Oh, yes.

41:20.353 --> 41:21.582
And more.
