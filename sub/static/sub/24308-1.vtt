00:29.278 --> 00:29.977
Hey.

00:29.979 --> 00:31.978
Hi.

00:31.980 --> 00:34.250
Uh, what's going on?

00:36.818 --> 00:39.521
I... I brought you your sweater
because I'm leaving tomorrow.

00:43.659 --> 00:44.494
Thanks.

01:07.982 --> 01:09.515
Hey, where are you?

01:09.517 --> 01:10.750
Uh, I'm
buying toilet paper.

01:10.752 --> 01:11.652
Are you here?

01:11.654 --> 01:13.286
That was so quick.

01:13.288 --> 01:15.521
Yeah, Gab, my flight
landed, like, two hours ago.

01:15.523 --> 01:16.622
Where are you?

01:16.624 --> 01:17.791
I'm close.

01:17.793 --> 01:19.393
How was your flight?

01:19.395 --> 01:21.328
Uh, yeah, it was OK.

01:21.330 --> 01:22.628
I sort of sat next to
this guy with this,

01:22.630 --> 01:24.030
like, severe peanut allergy.

01:24.032 --> 01:25.798
So I spent the
entire flight trying

01:25.800 --> 01:27.467
to convince myself
that, uh, my throat

01:27.469 --> 01:28.735
couldn't spontaneously close.

01:28.737 --> 01:29.970
- Really?
- Where are you?

01:29.972 --> 01:30.870
I really have to pee.

01:30.872 --> 01:34.574
I have to pee so bad.

01:34.576 --> 01:36.976
Gab?

01:36.978 --> 01:37.977
Gabby?

01:37.979 --> 01:38.979
Oh, my God.

01:41.984 --> 01:42.982
Sorry.

01:42.984 --> 01:43.884
Seriously?

01:43.886 --> 01:44.950
Oh, hey.

01:44.952 --> 01:45.885
Hi.

01:45.887 --> 01:48.554
Hi.

01:48.556 --> 01:49.488
Thank you, dear.

01:49.490 --> 01:51.425
Mm-hmm.

01:51.427 --> 01:53.560
Um, so I've been
looking at apartments.

01:53.562 --> 01:56.863
And, uh, they all look
like crime scenes.

01:56.865 --> 01:58.899
So there's that.

01:58.901 --> 02:00.334
I actually think
I have a friend

02:00.336 --> 02:02.501
who's a real estate agent now.

02:02.503 --> 02:03.536
Who?

02:03.538 --> 02:04.870
You don't know her.

02:04.872 --> 02:06.907
You... you have a
friend that I don't know?

02:06.909 --> 02:10.710
Yeah, Meg Jones, she was my
study friend in art history.

02:10.711 --> 02:11.978
Oh.

02:11.980 --> 02:14.080
She's actually very funny.

02:14.082 --> 02:15.748
Oh.

02:15.750 --> 02:17.918
I don't have her number
anymore, but I could email her.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.019
Yeah, yeah, that
would be great.

02:19.021 --> 02:20.053
Why don't you email her?

02:20.055 --> 02:21.555
And then you guys can hang out.

02:21.557 --> 02:22.688
And then, you know,
because she's so funny,

02:22.690 --> 02:23.823
you'll just become best friends.

02:23.825 --> 02:26.359
And I'll, um, die alone.

02:26.361 --> 02:29.795
D, she's old news.

02:29.797 --> 02:32.431
You're my one and only.

02:32.433 --> 02:33.934
You promise?

02:33.936 --> 02:35.735
Wait.

02:35.737 --> 02:37.904
But can you actually email her,
in all seriousness, because I...

02:37.906 --> 02:38.871
I need to find an apartment?

02:38.873 --> 02:40.006
Yeah, you got it.

02:40.008 --> 02:41.574
Because I'm
basically homeless.

02:41.576 --> 02:42.976
OK.

02:42.978 --> 02:44.644
All right.

02:51.854 --> 02:53.387
I love it.

02:53.389 --> 02:55.389
Oh, great.

02:55.391 --> 02:57.490
You look beautiful.

02:57.492 --> 02:58.959
Thank you.

02:58.961 --> 03:01.093
I think I want it in pink.

03:01.095 --> 03:05.664
Oh, actually, we only make
the dresses in white or ivory.

03:05.666 --> 03:07.967
I don't understand.

03:07.969 --> 03:13.038
Um, we only make the
dresses in white or ivory.

03:13.040 --> 03:14.407
Why not?

03:14.409 --> 03:15.542
I thought they
were made to order.

03:15.544 --> 03:17.411
Yes, they are
made to order, uh,

03:17.413 --> 03:18.845
but we make the dress as is.

03:18.847 --> 03:20.980
And then we can do
slight alterations,

03:20.982 --> 03:23.650
like adding a modesty
panel or lowering the back.

03:23.652 --> 03:27.520
But, um, the fabric is set in
order to maintain the integrity

03:27.522 --> 03:28.854
of the designer's vision.

03:28.856 --> 03:31.591
So you're telling me I
can add a modesty panel

03:31.593 --> 03:35.595
and lower the back, but
I can't have it in pink?

03:35.597 --> 03:39.833
Uh, ye... um, yes,
that's correct.

03:39.835 --> 03:42.602
Well, I don't want a lower
back or a modesty panel.

03:42.604 --> 03:45.672
I just want it in pink.

03:45.674 --> 03:47.039
I feel like she's not
even listening to me.

03:47.041 --> 03:48.542
This is ridiculous.

03:48.544 --> 03:50.509
She doesn't know what
she's talking about.

03:50.511 --> 03:53.680
Can we have it in lavender?

03:53.682 --> 03:55.549
Um...

03:55.551 --> 03:56.483
Hi, Meg.
Hi.

03:56.485 --> 03:57.184
It's Diana.

03:57.186 --> 03:58.785
I'm so sorry I'm late.

03:58.787 --> 04:00.120
Yeah, no problem.

04:00.122 --> 04:01.488
Shall we?

04:01.490 --> 04:02.788
Yeah, um, I just...
I'm never late.

04:02.790 --> 04:03.857
But I'm on my lunch break.

04:03.859 --> 04:05.658
I work in this bridal store.

04:05.660 --> 04:07.526
And this bride spent, like, 10
minutes picking out this veil

04:07.528 --> 04:09.095
that she didn't even buy.

04:09.097 --> 04:10.930
So, um, I murdered her.

04:10.932 --> 04:12.966
And, uh, then I came right here.

04:12.968 --> 04:14.467
Fine.

04:14.469 --> 04:15.070
OK.

04:16.971 --> 04:18.938
The bathroom and kitchen
were renovated six years ago,

04:18.940 --> 04:21.208
but the style is consistent.

04:21.209 --> 04:22.842
What do you think?

04:22.844 --> 04:23.809
I mean, it's...

04:23.811 --> 04:25.544
it's great.

04:25.546 --> 04:27.948
Well, you can fill this out,
and I will give it to Amy.

04:27.950 --> 04:29.982
She's a little picky about who
she lets into the building.

04:29.984 --> 04:32.885
But if she's interested, I will
set up a meeting for you two.

04:32.887 --> 04:34.253
Thank you.

04:34.255 --> 04:37.724
Do you think it's an
issue that I'm on parole?

04:37.726 --> 04:40.626
Sorry?

04:40.628 --> 04:41.895
I was just...

04:41.897 --> 04:43.597
sorry.

04:43.599 --> 04:46.900
I just made a stupid joke
about being on parole, but...

04:49.070 --> 04:50.604
Is there anything
else you'd like to see?

04:50.606 --> 04:52.873
Uh, no, I think I'm good.

04:52.875 --> 04:55.008
OK, well, thank
you for coming in.

04:55.010 --> 04:58.544
Yeah, thank you
for having me in.

04:58.546 --> 04:59.246
Yeah.

04:59.248 --> 05:00.082
Thank you.

05:04.019 --> 05:09.856
And then when I was 29,
I played a mobster's wife...

05:09.858 --> 05:11.123
Thank you.

05:11.125 --> 05:13.592
...in this little
play on Broadway.

05:13.594 --> 05:16.729
And I met my husband,
Patrick, the director.

05:16.731 --> 05:19.900
And long story short, we
took over this property

05:19.902 --> 05:21.034
from his mom.

05:21.036 --> 05:22.701
And at that point,
it was verging

05:22.703 --> 05:24.104
on a retirement community.

05:24.106 --> 05:26.705
I mean, we were the
youngest by 20 years.

05:26.707 --> 05:31.143
So a few years ago, I
decided I didn't want a bunch

05:31.145 --> 05:32.811
of old people in the building.

05:32.813 --> 05:35.915
Mm, so you killed them?

05:35.917 --> 05:38.751
I like to think
of it as euthanasia.

05:38.753 --> 05:40.287
I don't know.

05:40.289 --> 05:42.756
Just being the only old broad
here makes me feel young.

05:42.758 --> 05:44.056
You are not old.

05:44.058 --> 05:45.724
I am not getting any younger.

05:45.726 --> 05:48.193
Neither am I. I mean, I
found a full-length gray hair

05:48.195 --> 05:50.931
the other day, so I get it.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.164
I saved it, if you
want to see it.

05:52.166 --> 05:53.566
No, thank you.
That's OK.

05:53.568 --> 05:55.135
OK.

05:55.137 --> 05:56.902
So you're a writer?

05:56.904 --> 05:59.773
Yeah, uh, yes, I'm trying.

05:59.775 --> 06:00.974
I'm trying to be a writer.

06:00.976 --> 06:04.945
I am... I work in a
bridal store, you

06:04.947 --> 06:06.979
know, to actually make money.

06:06.981 --> 06:10.150
You know, I was a
waitress for seven years

06:10.152 --> 06:12.118
before I made any real
money as an actress.

06:12.120 --> 06:15.155
I think it's the
nature of the beast.

06:15.157 --> 06:19.025
That's very
reassuring to hear.

06:19.027 --> 06:22.361
Are you acting in
anything right now?

06:22.363 --> 06:23.996
No.

06:23.998 --> 06:28.301
No, um, I... my husband
passed away a few years ago.

06:28.303 --> 06:32.371
And, um, he passed
away a few years ago.

06:32.373 --> 06:38.979
And so I am just busy taking
care of the building for now.

06:38.981 --> 06:40.647
You do an amazing job.

06:40.649 --> 06:42.181
It's... it's so beautiful.

06:42.183 --> 06:45.251
Well, thank you.

06:45.253 --> 06:47.320
You know what?

06:47.322 --> 06:48.722
I like you, Diana.

06:48.724 --> 06:51.758
The apartment is
yours if you want it.

06:51.760 --> 06:53.126
I would love that.

06:53.128 --> 06:54.126
I think we should hug.

06:54.128 --> 06:55.061
Let's hug.

06:55.063 --> 06:56.895
Yeah, yeah, OK.

07:55.724 --> 07:56.422
Hi, Ben.

07:56.424 --> 07:57.424
Hey.

07:57.426 --> 07:58.357
Hi.

08:01.262 --> 08:04.097
Um, you ready?

08:04.099 --> 08:06.999
Yeah, yes, born
ready, uh, except

08:07.001 --> 08:09.768
I think that it's
supposed to rain in a bit.

08:09.770 --> 08:12.205
Oh, no, no, no, no, it...
it's going to be OK, yeah.

08:12.207 --> 08:13.106
Oh?

08:13.108 --> 08:14.808
I looked into it.

08:14.810 --> 08:16.475
Well, great.

08:16.477 --> 08:19.145
Yeah, internet.

08:19.147 --> 08:20.713
Oh, I was going to ask you.

08:20.715 --> 08:23.015
I knew a guy, but
internet, that makes sense.

08:23.017 --> 08:25.285
I know a guy
named the Internet.

08:25.287 --> 08:28.987
Here, if I turn, I'm
having a little trouble

08:28.989 --> 08:31.323
with the directional, uh...

08:31.325 --> 08:32.859
- I think you're doing great.
- Yeah?

08:32.861 --> 08:33.792
Yeah.

08:33.794 --> 08:35.227
I'm good.

08:35.230 --> 08:38.797
It's just these... these
oars seem, like, really old.

08:38.799 --> 08:41.433
Very old, very old
oars, terribly old.

08:41.434 --> 08:45.205
- Um, this is good.
- Great.

08:45.207 --> 08:46.339
Are you hungry?

08:46.341 --> 08:49.008
Always.

08:49.010 --> 08:51.344
This is, like, a real date, huh?

08:51.346 --> 08:53.446
I mean, we're on a
boat in Prospect Park,

08:53.448 --> 08:55.047
and your brought a picnic.

08:55.049 --> 08:56.014
How am I doing?

08:56.016 --> 08:57.249
You're doing all right.

08:57.251 --> 08:58.518
This is, uh, our table.

08:58.520 --> 09:01.220
Lovely, beautiful table.

09:01.222 --> 09:03.056
Um, I... I should
probably warn you,

09:03.058 --> 09:05.859
though, I am an
incredibly picky eater.

09:05.861 --> 09:07.127
Oh, yeah, I know.

09:07.129 --> 09:08.795
Uh, I saw you picking
olives and peppers

09:08.797 --> 09:10.830
off your pizza at the party.

09:10.832 --> 09:13.499
Oh, you, uh, saw that?

09:13.501 --> 09:15.234
That's embarrassing.

09:15.236 --> 09:18.904
Um, right, I hate olives and
peppers, which is why I was

09:18.906 --> 09:21.273
removing them from my pizza.

09:21.275 --> 09:22.175
Yeah, I know.

09:22.177 --> 09:23.877
Uh, I figured.

09:23.879 --> 09:25.979
Right.

09:25.981 --> 09:29.382
This is a box full
of olives and peppers.

09:29.384 --> 09:30.282
It's not.

09:30.284 --> 09:31.920
Great, that's great.

09:49.371 --> 09:51.473
You know, I really like you.

09:54.342 --> 09:58.143
I really like you, too.

09:58.145 --> 10:02.047
Do you want some more wine?

10:02.049 --> 10:03.416
Yes, please.

10:03.418 --> 10:04.349
OK.

10:04.351 --> 10:07.253
OK.

10:14.962 --> 10:15.894
Hey, what's up?

10:15.896 --> 10:16.498
Ben lives here.

10:17.531 --> 10:19.132
Where?

10:19.134 --> 10:21.200
Uh, in my building
downstairs, Ben lives in my,

10:21.202 --> 10:22.234
uh, building downstairs.

10:22.236 --> 10:23.536
What?

10:23.538 --> 10:25.370
Yes,
yep, Ben Wineburger

10:25.372 --> 10:26.439
lives in my building.

10:26.441 --> 10:27.473
I just saw him.

10:27.475 --> 10:29.242
Oh, my God, what did you say?

10:29.244 --> 10:31.476
Yeah, I mean, like, I just
saw him through his window.

10:31.478 --> 10:33.178
He didn't see me see him.

10:33.180 --> 10:35.581
I just... you know, I just
saw him through his window.

10:35.583 --> 10:36.481
So...

10:36.483 --> 10:39.319
That's so crazy.

10:39.321 --> 10:41.854
You know, Stephanie Jacobs
moved into her ex-boyfriend's

10:41.856 --> 10:43.455
building in college.

10:43.457 --> 10:46.225
And Daisy Debrell lived in the
same building as her ex also,

10:46.227 --> 10:48.894
but I think they
were neighbors first.

10:48.896 --> 10:53.332
Right, um, do I go say hi?

10:53.334 --> 10:57.637
Um, hey, D, I, uh, I gotta go.

10:57.639 --> 10:59.906
Why don't you go to sleep, and...

10:59.908 --> 11:01.206
and we'll talk
about it tomorrow?

11:01.208 --> 11:02.575
- But, Gabby...
- You're fine.

11:02.577 --> 11:03.909
I love you.

11:03.911 --> 11:04.512
Bye.

11:07.082 --> 11:08.013
What's up?

11:08.015 --> 11:09.385
Is it hot in here?

11:13.654 --> 11:16.154
Hey, do you like Radiohead?

11:16.156 --> 11:17.489
Yeah.

11:17.491 --> 11:18.423
Really?

11:18.425 --> 11:19.558
Yeah, do you want to...

11:19.560 --> 11:21.994
do you want to
put on some music?

11:21.996 --> 11:23.329
No, I was just wondering.

11:23.331 --> 11:25.665
Oh.

11:38.045 --> 11:39.045
Hello.

11:39.047 --> 11:40.312
Hello.

11:40.314 --> 11:41.681
We have a delivery
downstairs for Diana.

11:41.683 --> 11:42.916
Oh, shit.

11:42.918 --> 11:43.950
Um, yeah, I'll be right down.

11:43.952 --> 11:47.387
I'll be right down.

11:47.389 --> 11:48.287
Excuse me.

11:48.289 --> 11:49.288
Are you Diana?

11:49.290 --> 11:51.957
No, I'm a man.

11:51.959 --> 11:52.560
Are you Diana?

11:57.531 --> 11:58.965
Hey.

11:58.967 --> 12:00.266
Hi.

12:00.268 --> 12:01.968
What... what are you
doing in my building?

12:01.970 --> 12:05.971
Uh, yeah, I live here now.

12:05.973 --> 12:08.707
Uh, I... I... too, I
live here now, too.

12:08.709 --> 12:10.209
I... I'm moving in.

12:10.211 --> 12:12.011
Lady, we have a lot
of deliveries after you.

12:12.013 --> 12:13.613
So can we, you know, get moving?

12:13.615 --> 12:15.013
Of course, I'm so sorry.

12:15.015 --> 12:18.216
Uh, second floor,
the door is open.

12:18.218 --> 12:19.354
I'm going to come down.
I'll come down.

12:25.961 --> 12:27.292
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:27.294 --> 12:28.393
Hi.

12:28.395 --> 12:29.198
Hi.

12:32.701 --> 12:34.334
You got glasses.

12:34.336 --> 12:37.570
Yeah, I, uh, stopped
wearing contacts.

12:37.572 --> 12:41.673
Right, that...
that makes sense.

12:41.675 --> 12:46.311
Um, I started
eating tomatoes again.

12:46.313 --> 12:50.082
So that's my news.

12:50.084 --> 12:51.017
Wait.

12:51.019 --> 12:52.351
So what's happening?

12:52.353 --> 12:54.387
Right, so I
didn't know that you

12:54.389 --> 12:57.523
lived here until I saw your
name on the mailbox last night.

12:57.525 --> 13:01.127
I, um, I found the apartment
through Gabby's friend, Meg.

13:01.129 --> 13:02.061
From Meg?

13:02.063 --> 13:03.028
Yes, she's a...

13:03.030 --> 13:05.764
a real estate agent lady.

13:05.766 --> 13:10.235
OK, um, are you staying?

13:10.237 --> 13:14.139
Uh, yeah?

13:14.141 --> 13:15.340
I... I mean, yes.

13:15.342 --> 13:18.511
I mean, um, I...

13:18.513 --> 13:20.046
I know it's kind of bizarre.

13:20.048 --> 13:22.181
But I feel like worst
things have happened,

13:22.183 --> 13:25.350
you know, like, people
dying of cancer or world

13:25.352 --> 13:27.085
poverty or mass suicide.

13:27.087 --> 13:28.253
Of course.

13:28.255 --> 13:29.388
I'm aware of, like,
poverty, Diana.

13:29.390 --> 13:31.190
No, I know.

13:31.192 --> 13:32.191
I'm just saying, I feel like we
can handle living in a building

13:32.193 --> 13:33.091
- together.
- Yeah, I can...

13:33.093 --> 13:33.658
I can handle it, too.

13:33.660 --> 13:34.426
I can handle it.

13:34.428 --> 13:35.264
It's just weird.

13:39.199 --> 13:40.666
Well, do you want
to maybe sit down

13:40.668 --> 13:44.604
later and... and have
coffee or something

13:44.606 --> 13:46.040
and make it less weird?

13:49.443 --> 13:51.244
So we're neighbors?

13:51.246 --> 13:53.779
Yes, yep, we're neighbors.

13:53.781 --> 13:57.550
Maybe let's just
leave it at that.

13:57.552 --> 13:58.718
Yeah.
Yeah, for sure.

13:58.720 --> 14:00.085
I... I gotta go.

14:00.087 --> 14:01.454
Yeah, OK, yeah,
I'll see you around.

14:01.456 --> 14:03.056
Or I won't see you around.

14:03.058 --> 14:06.158
Or it was... yeah, we'll...

14:06.160 --> 14:06.760
bye.

14:10.631 --> 14:12.130
I don't understand.

14:12.132 --> 14:13.266
He brought a boat?

14:13.268 --> 14:14.533
What?

14:14.535 --> 14:15.567
No.

14:15.569 --> 14:17.503
He rented one at the park, Gabs.

14:17.505 --> 14:19.238
It's, like, a thing people do.

14:19.240 --> 14:20.505
Huh.

14:20.507 --> 14:23.643
It was super cheesy,
but also kind of...

14:23.645 --> 14:25.177
I mean, it was...

14:25.179 --> 14:26.845
it was cute.

14:26.847 --> 14:28.848
Is Ben your new boyfriend?

14:28.850 --> 14:31.651
What?

14:31.653 --> 14:35.555
No... no, no, what are we, 10?

14:35.557 --> 14:37.456
He is not my new boyfriend.

14:37.458 --> 14:39.859
A, we've been on one date.

14:39.861 --> 14:42.494
Uh, and I'm leaving, so...

14:42.496 --> 14:44.397
Oh, my God, in,
like, six months.

14:44.399 --> 14:45.431
Well.

14:45.433 --> 14:48.500
You always do this.

14:48.502 --> 14:50.570
Do what?

14:50.572 --> 14:55.707
D, maybe let's just, like,
wait a minute and enjoy this.

14:55.709 --> 14:58.543
You know?
Don't think so much.

14:58.545 --> 14:59.845
Let's go say hi.

14:59.847 --> 15:01.580
I wouldn't say we
hooked up, but we kissed.

15:01.582 --> 15:05.118
Like, there was a bridge.

15:05.120 --> 15:05.851
A bridge?

15:05.853 --> 15:06.654
Yeah.

15:08.356 --> 15:09.455
Did you get, like, a
handjob under the bridge?

15:09.457 --> 15:10.422
No, man, no.

15:10.424 --> 15:11.657
What are you talking about?

15:11.659 --> 15:13.359
Like, a dry handjob
under the bridge.

15:13.361 --> 15:14.694
- I don't know what that is.
- They're very underrated.

15:14.696 --> 15:15.862
- Dude, shut up.
- Hi.

15:15.864 --> 15:17.363
- Hi, Ben.
- Hi, what's up?

15:17.365 --> 15:18.564
How are you doing?
What's going on?

15:18.566 --> 15:19.731
Thank you guys for coming.
What's up?

15:19.733 --> 15:21.102
How are you guys
enjoying yourselves?

15:22.504 --> 15:23.735
- Taking it all in.
- Mm-hmm, take it in.

15:23.737 --> 15:25.138
- Take it in.
- Who's the artist again?

15:25.140 --> 15:27.172
My friend, Marie,
she's from Beirut.

15:27.174 --> 15:27.873
She's very cool.

15:27.875 --> 15:29.207
She's cool as shit.

15:29.209 --> 15:31.444
Mm-hmm, all right.

15:31.446 --> 15:33.912
Have you guys been inside
the installation yet?

15:33.914 --> 15:35.447
Uh, no, not yet.

15:35.449 --> 15:39.551
Well, OK, Ben and Diana
are going to go inside.

15:39.553 --> 15:40.920
And, uh, Gabby and
I are gonna get,

15:40.922 --> 15:42.187
uh, we're gonna get a drink.

15:42.189 --> 15:43.321
Yes.

15:43.323 --> 15:44.257
- I'm thirst... I'm thirsty.
- OK.

15:44.259 --> 15:45.291
I need to get one now.

15:45.293 --> 15:49.595
You're thir... you're thirsty.

15:49.597 --> 15:53.865
Do you want to accompany
me to the little room?

15:53.867 --> 15:55.902
Absolutely, let's...
let's find our way.

15:55.904 --> 15:56.835
Yeah.

15:56.837 --> 15:59.772
To the little room.

15:59.774 --> 16:01.806
Are we in a '70s fever dream?

16:01.808 --> 16:06.412
Is that what... like, did
we accidentally do acid?

16:06.414 --> 16:07.879
Oh, I'm on acid.

16:07.881 --> 16:09.782
- You are?
- Yeah.

16:09.784 --> 16:11.683
Oh, good, OK,
so I'm not alone.

16:11.685 --> 16:13.219
- No, no, no, no.
- OK.

16:13.221 --> 16:14.619
No.

16:14.621 --> 16:15.854
I think I'm going to go
down for a nap, actually.

16:15.856 --> 16:16.788
Yeah?

16:16.790 --> 16:18.257
Yeah.

16:18.259 --> 16:19.825
I think I could
comfortably sleep in here.

16:19.827 --> 16:23.729
Certainly have, like,
vivid nightmares, but...

16:23.731 --> 16:24.763
Terri... terrifying nightmares.

16:24.765 --> 16:25.898
Yeah, you... yeah.

16:25.900 --> 16:26.735
Uh-huh.

16:30.605 --> 16:33.471
Do you want to get
dinner maybe, like,

16:33.473 --> 16:36.308
before the acid wears off?

16:36.310 --> 16:37.545
It'll be, like, crazy.

16:40.582 --> 16:42.882
Yeah, let's get dinner.

16:42.884 --> 16:43.816
Cool.

16:43.818 --> 16:44.653
OK.

16:55.829 --> 16:58.431
I think
my roommates are asleep.

16:58.433 --> 17:00.432
OK.

17:00.434 --> 17:03.402
OK, I'll be quiet.

17:03.404 --> 17:06.405
Do you want to go to my room?

17:06.406 --> 17:07.406
Sure.

17:07.407 --> 17:09.809
OK, this way.

17:30.430 --> 17:34.266
Do you want... do
you want to make out?

17:34.268 --> 17:34.870
Yeah.

17:47.748 --> 17:49.014
Do I have to move?

17:49.016 --> 17:51.317
No, no, you
don't have to move.

17:51.319 --> 17:54.654
Of course not, woman up.

17:54.656 --> 17:55.788
Yeah, you're right.

17:55.790 --> 17:57.055
- I'm not moving.
- No.

17:57.057 --> 17:58.323
Nobody's moving.

17:58.325 --> 17:59.625
We're both adults.

17:59.627 --> 18:00.693
- We can handle being neighbors.
- Yeah.

18:00.695 --> 18:01.593
Right?

18:01.595 --> 18:02.727
You're mature.

18:02.729 --> 18:05.464
Yeah, we can be friends.

18:05.466 --> 18:08.400
I just can't believe he didn't
want to catch up, you know?

18:08.402 --> 18:09.935
Did he seem upset?

18:09.937 --> 18:12.304
Hmm-mm, no, I told you.

18:12.306 --> 18:13.071
He just seemed cold.

18:13.073 --> 18:15.041
He was probably shocked.

18:15.043 --> 18:18.511
Yeah, no, I... yeah, he
was definitely shocked.

18:18.513 --> 18:20.612
But I just feel
like it's really...

18:20.614 --> 18:21.946
it's awkward because I...

18:21.948 --> 18:23.448
I don't know.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.784
I feel like he really
didn't want me here.

18:25.786 --> 18:27.653
He's probably still
in love with you.

18:27.655 --> 18:28.987
He's not still
in love with me.

18:28.989 --> 18:29.888
- Oh, I think he might be.
- He is not.

18:29.890 --> 18:31.424
I think he might be.

18:31.426 --> 18:33.059
He's almost certainly
still in love with you.

18:33.061 --> 18:34.560
Gabby, he's not.

18:34.562 --> 18:36.928
Is he still in love with her?

18:36.930 --> 18:38.630
He's not.

18:38.632 --> 18:41.533
I just think that it's silly
that we can't be friendly.

18:41.535 --> 18:43.337
Well, maybe he just doesn't
want to be friends with you.

18:47.408 --> 18:48.440
You know what?

18:48.442 --> 18:50.076
I would just let him be for now.

18:50.078 --> 18:52.610
And don't push the friend thing.

18:52.612 --> 18:57.550
It'll happen in time and...

18:57.552 --> 18:59.452
Yeah.

18:59.454 --> 19:00.552
Yeah, no, you're right.

19:00.554 --> 19:02.855
You're right.

19:02.857 --> 19:03.859
I'm just going to
be zen about it.

20:00.415 --> 20:02.148
Are you testing fresh
batteries with your mouth?

20:02.150 --> 20:03.948
You know what?

20:03.950 --> 20:05.917
When you burn yourself on one
of the candles we have to light

20:05.919 --> 20:07.753
when the power goes out,
I'm not gonna let you

20:07.755 --> 20:09.554
partake in my emergency kit.

20:09.556 --> 20:12.491
I mean, I just feel
like fresh batteries are...

20:12.493 --> 20:16.896
you buy them with fresh energy.

20:16.898 --> 20:18.464
You know, that's kind
of the point of...

20:18.466 --> 20:20.599
of buying batteries new.

20:20.601 --> 20:22.201
You know what?

20:22.203 --> 20:23.636
I think my emergency kit and I
are just going to go somewhere

20:23.638 --> 20:24.936
that we feel appreciated.

20:24.938 --> 20:26.004
No.

20:26.006 --> 20:27.106
- No, no, hmm-mm, come on.
- No?

20:27.108 --> 20:28.874
- Come on.
- Hmm-mm.

20:28.876 --> 20:29.841
I need them for the birds.

20:29.843 --> 20:30.943
No, too bad.

20:30.945 --> 20:32.177
- No, for the birds.
- Too bad.

20:32.179 --> 20:33.611
Please, for the birds.

20:33.613 --> 20:35.080
I guess we're gonna
let you bleed out.

20:35.082 --> 20:37.782
No, seriously, I
appreciate your preparedness.

20:37.784 --> 20:39.517
- Come on.
- I don't think I believe you.

20:39.519 --> 20:40.785
- I want to test a battery.
- You know what?

20:40.787 --> 20:42.021
- I don't know if you're ready.
- No.

20:42.023 --> 20:42.921
Are you ready?

20:42.923 --> 20:43.656
No, I... I really do.

20:43.658 --> 20:44.557
I want to...

20:44.559 --> 20:46.692
I want to put it in my...

20:46.694 --> 20:47.959
What do you want to...

20:47.961 --> 20:48.994
what do you want to
do with the battery?

20:48.996 --> 20:49.895
I want to put it in my mouth.

20:49.897 --> 20:52.798
Oh, well, all right.

20:52.800 --> 20:55.634
Ow.

20:55.636 --> 20:56.534
Oh, that's good.

20:56.536 --> 20:58.036
That is good.

20:58.038 --> 20:58.937
Um...

20:58.939 --> 21:00.205
Um...

21:00.207 --> 21:01.877
I also filled the
bath tub up with water.

21:02.677 --> 21:03.975
You did?

21:03.977 --> 21:05.176
Yeah, just in case
they shut the water off.

21:05.178 --> 21:06.978
My bathroom?

21:06.980 --> 21:09.215
So we, um, water to flush the
toilet or for drinking water.

21:09.217 --> 21:10.782
Oh, for both of those.

21:10.784 --> 21:11.951
For both.
And I got...

21:11.953 --> 21:13.084
From the same bathtub.

21:13.086 --> 21:14.219
...baby wipes for
our body, yeah.

21:14.221 --> 21:15.253
Wait.
You got baby wipes?

21:15.255 --> 21:16.589
- Yeah.
- I love baby wipes.

21:16.591 --> 21:17.755
I know.
That's why I got them.

21:17.757 --> 21:19.958
I carry them, like, in my...

21:19.960 --> 21:21.526
in my tote bag.

21:21.528 --> 21:23.028
What, in your tote bag?

21:24.232 --> 21:26.064
- Oh, my God.
- It's happening.

21:26.066 --> 21:26.999
You were right.

21:30.971 --> 21:31.971
Are you warm enough?

21:31.973 --> 21:33.038
Mm-hmm, just getting cozy.

21:33.040 --> 21:33.842
Good.

21:38.178 --> 21:40.846
So in my, um, sociology class...

21:40.848 --> 21:42.648
Mm-hmm.

21:42.650 --> 21:48.219
Uh, our professor asked us to
write down our vision of life,

21:48.221 --> 21:51.756
like, a exercise.

21:51.758 --> 21:52.925
And, um...

21:52.927 --> 21:55.660
That's super cheesy.

21:55.662 --> 21:57.629
Yeah, I guess.

21:57.631 --> 21:58.630
But I don't know.

21:58.632 --> 22:01.233
It seemed like...

22:01.235 --> 22:02.600
I don't know.

22:02.602 --> 22:04.736
It just kind of
caught me off guard.

22:04.738 --> 22:08.006
You know, does it make
you think of anything?

22:08.008 --> 22:11.877
Um, no.

22:11.879 --> 22:13.712
I don't know, no.

22:13.714 --> 22:14.980
You don't have...

22:14.982 --> 22:17.049
you don't have dreams?

22:17.051 --> 22:18.117
No.

22:18.119 --> 22:19.251
You don't have
dreams in there?

22:19.253 --> 22:21.887
I have dreams.

22:21.889 --> 22:23.121
I have dreams.

22:23.123 --> 22:27.792
And I don't like to
say them out loud.

22:27.794 --> 22:30.161
Why?

22:30.163 --> 22:33.666
I don't know.

22:33.668 --> 22:38.771
Um, OK, when I was
in the fourth grade,

22:38.773 --> 22:44.577
I had this epic, epic crush
on this boy named Dale.

22:44.579 --> 22:45.843
His name was Dale?

22:45.845 --> 22:47.111
Yes, his name was Dale.

22:47.113 --> 22:48.847
OK.

22:48.849 --> 22:52.685
Anyway, I planned to take
this secret with me to my grave.

22:52.687 --> 22:55.821
But then Stephanie Jacobs
had this slumber party.

22:55.823 --> 22:57.590
And we were playing
truth or dare.

22:57.592 --> 23:00.626
And she asked me point blank,
do you have a crush on Dale?

23:00.628 --> 23:03.963
And I had to say yes.

23:03.965 --> 23:07.699
And then on Monday,
she told everybody,

23:07.701 --> 23:14.238
including Dale, who came up to
me at recess and asked me out.

23:14.240 --> 23:16.074
But it was a joke.

23:16.076 --> 23:17.876
And then he started laughing.

23:17.878 --> 23:19.278
And then all of his
friends started laughing.

23:19.280 --> 23:20.678
And then everyone was laughing.

23:20.680 --> 23:23.849
And then he, um, pantsed me.

23:23.851 --> 23:24.782
Oh, my God.

23:24.784 --> 23:27.953
That... he pantsed you?

23:27.955 --> 23:29.288
Dale is an asshole.

23:29.290 --> 23:32.925
I know, totally.

23:32.927 --> 23:37.262
But he did teach me, um,
the invaluable lesson

23:37.264 --> 23:41.032
that the only way to protect
yourself from deep pain

23:41.034 --> 23:42.301
and humiliation
is just to, like,

23:42.303 --> 23:45.137
bury your feelings
deep within your soul

23:45.139 --> 23:47.740
and never let them out.

23:47.742 --> 23:51.275
That's horrible.

23:51.277 --> 23:52.910
I'm just... I'm kidding.

23:52.912 --> 23:54.946
I'm... I mean, I'm...

23:54.948 --> 23:56.281
I'm OK.

23:56.283 --> 23:58.384
You're doing great.

23:58.386 --> 24:02.154
Do you... do you need a cuddle?

24:02.156 --> 24:03.088
Sure, I'll...

24:03.090 --> 24:04.223
Like, a little one?

24:04.225 --> 24:05.991
I'll... I'll take
a little cuddle,

24:05.993 --> 24:07.662
only a little one, though, OK?

24:12.400 --> 24:15.734
Do you want to know what
my vision for life was?

24:15.736 --> 24:17.336
Hmm?

24:17.338 --> 24:19.737
Yeah, sure.

24:19.739 --> 24:21.439
You're gonna make fun of me.

24:21.441 --> 24:24.309
Probably.

24:24.311 --> 24:25.843
I don't know.

24:25.845 --> 24:30.014
I kind of want, like,
what my parents have,

24:30.016 --> 24:37.755
like, I don't know, being
with someone for decades

24:37.757 --> 24:39.059
and still being in love.

25:04.217 --> 25:05.019
Amy?

25:25.272 --> 25:27.272
Hi.

25:27.274 --> 25:28.940
Hi.

25:28.942 --> 25:29.743
Hey.

25:32.780 --> 25:33.478
I'm sorry.

25:33.480 --> 25:36.215
Is Ben moving?

25:36.217 --> 25:38.317
No.

25:38.319 --> 25:40.785
Oh, OK.

25:40.787 --> 25:45.791
Um, sorry.

25:45.793 --> 25:47.225
Uh, why are you here?

25:47.227 --> 25:49.360
Uh, Ben?

25:49.362 --> 25:53.031
Yeah, is it the pizza?

25:53.033 --> 25:54.366
Oh.

25:54.368 --> 25:55.967
Hey.

25:55.969 --> 26:01.874
Um, yeah, I was just
wondering if you knew what

26:01.876 --> 26:03.274
was going on with the, um...

26:03.276 --> 26:04.542
It's a scheduled power cut.

26:04.544 --> 26:06.110
They're doing
maintenance on the lines.

26:06.112 --> 26:09.915
Yeah, they... they
sent out a letter.

26:09.917 --> 26:11.315
Gotcha.

26:11.317 --> 26:14.855
I should, um, probably
check my mail more often.

26:19.459 --> 26:20.492
I'm sorry.

26:20.494 --> 26:22.127
Are you... are you guys dating?

26:22.129 --> 26:23.061
Yeah.

26:23.063 --> 26:24.897
Yeah.

26:24.899 --> 26:30.170
Cool, great, that's cool.

26:33.573 --> 26:34.973
I'm sorry.

26:34.975 --> 26:36.841
Did... did you know
that we dated when

26:36.843 --> 26:38.409
you showed me the apartment?

26:38.411 --> 26:39.578
No.

26:39.580 --> 26:41.280
Right, because
that would be crazy.

26:41.282 --> 26:43.581
Yeah, obviously,
I didn't know.

26:43.583 --> 26:45.016
Obviously.

26:50.224 --> 26:54.259
Yeah, well, goodnight.

26:54.261 --> 26:55.426
- Yeah.
- Goodnight.

26:55.428 --> 26:57.196
- Enjoy your pizza...
- Goodnight.

26:57.198 --> 26:58.263
...when it arrives.

26:58.265 --> 26:59.197
- Yeah, all right.
- See ya.

26:59.199 --> 27:00.034
Bye.

27:11.277 --> 27:12.511
This is disgusting.

27:12.513 --> 27:14.178
Why did you make me get this?

27:14.180 --> 27:15.313
It's so good.

27:15.315 --> 27:16.215
It's disgusting.

27:16.217 --> 27:17.582
You're crazy.

27:17.584 --> 27:19.417
I am not crazy.

27:19.419 --> 27:21.853
You're bananas.

27:21.855 --> 27:24.322
Um, what's going on with Ben?

27:24.324 --> 27:28.126
Um, nothing, what do you mean?

27:28.128 --> 27:31.629
Like, have you talked to
him or Meg since the blackout?

27:31.631 --> 27:34.268
Uh, no, I haven't
really seen them around.

27:37.271 --> 27:38.603
What's happening with Marcus?

27:38.605 --> 27:42.241
Mm, nothing, he's an asshole.

27:42.243 --> 27:45.510
Well, yes, for any
specific reason this time?

27:45.512 --> 27:48.013
I texted him high,
like, four weeks ago,

27:48.015 --> 27:48.946
and he never replied.

27:48.948 --> 27:51.550
So, yeah, done with him.

27:51.552 --> 27:52.984
Do you promise?

27:52.986 --> 27:53.886
Diana.

27:53.888 --> 27:54.986
OK, OK.

27:54.988 --> 27:56.420
Yes, I'm serious.

27:56.422 --> 27:58.657
OK, I believe you.

27:58.659 --> 28:01.659
He's just so
friggin' charming.

28:01.661 --> 28:04.295
And when we're together,
he's very complimentary.

28:04.297 --> 28:05.997
Gabs, I get it.

28:05.999 --> 28:08.099
But it's not real, and then
it goes away really fast.

28:08.101 --> 28:09.568
And it leaves you
feeling like shit.

28:09.570 --> 28:13.504
And you're settling,
and you know it.

28:13.506 --> 28:15.940
OK.

28:15.942 --> 28:17.376
- I should get back to work.
- OK.

28:17.378 --> 28:18.310
I love you.

28:18.312 --> 28:19.511
I love you.

28:19.513 --> 28:20.445
I'll see you later.

28:20.447 --> 28:22.046
OK.

28:22.048 --> 28:25.484
I'd date you if I was a boy.

28:25.486 --> 28:26.621
Treat you better than Marcus.

28:30.157 --> 28:31.055
Hi.

28:31.057 --> 28:32.390
Hi.

28:32.392 --> 28:34.025
Oh, it's good to see you.

28:34.027 --> 28:34.993
You, too.

28:34.995 --> 28:36.194
How was London?

28:36.196 --> 28:37.529
Oh, it was great.
London was great.

28:37.531 --> 28:38.463
Good.

28:38.465 --> 28:40.064
How are you?

28:40.066 --> 28:41.198
Good, listen.

28:41.200 --> 28:42.501
The short stories
you sent me were

28:42.503 --> 28:44.969
very funny and very engaging.

28:44.971 --> 28:47.505
That's so great
to hear from you.

28:47.507 --> 28:48.540
Thank you.

28:48.542 --> 28:50.641
But this... this is not short.

28:50.643 --> 28:52.511
Uh, no.

28:52.513 --> 28:54.279
This is a novel.

28:54.281 --> 28:55.981
Yeah, I hope so.

28:55.983 --> 28:59.318
I am assuming it's a
work in progress, yes?

28:59.320 --> 29:01.419
Oh, yes, yes, 100%.

29:01.421 --> 29:04.656
Because right now, the
story seems scattered.

29:04.658 --> 29:06.124
OK, yeah.

29:06.126 --> 29:08.260
Firstly, the character,
I don't understand

29:08.262 --> 29:09.528
her motivation for anything.

29:09.530 --> 29:11.029
I mean, the friendship
part is very good.

29:11.031 --> 29:12.129
It's fleshed out.

29:12.131 --> 29:13.064
It's very nice.

29:13.066 --> 29:14.532
But that man...

29:14.534 --> 29:15.667
Hugo.

29:15.669 --> 29:17.969
He just seems like a jerk.

29:17.971 --> 29:19.103
Right.

29:19.105 --> 29:20.105
Why don't we go
through specifics.

29:20.107 --> 29:20.738
- OK.
- All right?

29:20.740 --> 29:21.974
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:21.976 --> 29:23.474
You know what?

29:23.476 --> 29:25.243
Let's start at the top, even
this just whole beginning.

29:25.245 --> 29:26.978
- So send me your next draft.
- I will, I promise.

29:26.980 --> 29:27.713
OK?

29:27.715 --> 29:28.981
Yeah.

29:28.983 --> 29:30.549
Thank you, Susan.

29:30.551 --> 29:31.550
Bye.

29:31.552 --> 29:32.352
Bye.

29:44.531 --> 29:45.464
Hey.

29:45.466 --> 29:46.764
Hey.

29:46.766 --> 29:49.067
They have candy corn here.

29:49.069 --> 29:49.938
Awesome.

29:52.706 --> 29:54.339
What's wrong?

29:54.341 --> 29:55.506
I just... I don't
understand who has

29:55.508 --> 29:57.309
a rooftop party for Halloween.

29:57.311 --> 29:58.243
It's October.

29:58.245 --> 29:59.644
It's freezing.

29:59.646 --> 30:01.446
I'm fine.

30:01.448 --> 30:05.016
Um, I did see some really cute
boys in line for the bathroom.

30:05.018 --> 30:06.051
How cute?

30:06.053 --> 30:08.186
Like, really cute.

30:08.188 --> 30:11.689
Like potential
husband material cute?

30:11.691 --> 30:13.358
Potentially.

30:13.360 --> 30:15.394
Tonight could be the night.

30:15.396 --> 30:18.730
I mean, I feel like tonight
probably is the night.

30:18.732 --> 30:22.099
We'll just turn this night
upside down and make it...

30:22.101 --> 30:23.234
Oh, my God, Marcus is here.

30:23.236 --> 30:24.171
...the night we
meet our husbands.

30:26.473 --> 30:27.308
Gab?

30:31.745 --> 30:33.811
Hello.

30:33.813 --> 30:35.179
Sorry.

30:35.181 --> 30:36.080
Hi.

30:36.082 --> 30:37.215
I'm Eliot.

30:37.217 --> 30:38.382
I admit, that
was kind of creepy.

30:38.384 --> 30:39.283
Uh...

30:39.285 --> 30:40.587
Well, it's Halloween.

30:47.761 --> 30:49.293
Chin chin.

30:49.295 --> 30:50.561
What?

30:50.563 --> 30:53.034
Chin chin, it's,
like, a British thing.

30:55.069 --> 30:56.068
Sure, sure.

30:56.070 --> 30:58.803
Cool.

30:58.805 --> 31:01.639
So do you have any,
like, hobbies or...

31:01.641 --> 31:03.542
Uh, yep, yeah.

31:03.544 --> 31:04.475
Nice.

31:04.477 --> 31:07.545
Um, I have hobbies.

31:07.547 --> 31:11.750
They, um, are I...

31:11.752 --> 31:12.818
I like to eat.

31:12.820 --> 31:13.717
Uh...

31:13.719 --> 31:15.689
OK, controversial.

31:22.629 --> 31:24.862
Hey, hey.

31:24.864 --> 31:25.830
Oh.

31:25.832 --> 31:27.398
Oh, my God, how are you?

31:27.400 --> 31:28.332
Hi.

31:28.334 --> 31:29.266
I'm good.

31:29.268 --> 31:30.668
How are you?

31:30.670 --> 31:34.406
Great, yeah, really good,
it's so good to see you.

31:34.408 --> 31:35.407
You seem weird.

31:35.409 --> 31:36.340
Are you... are you...

31:36.342 --> 31:37.309
are you OK?

31:37.311 --> 31:38.609
No, I'm... I'm fine.

31:38.611 --> 31:39.844
Yeah?

31:39.846 --> 31:43.314
You look beautiful.

31:43.316 --> 31:44.151
Thank you.

31:48.121 --> 31:51.555
Would you, uh, do you want
to come over to my place

31:51.557 --> 31:53.657
or whatever or...

31:53.659 --> 31:56.261
Uh, I... I can't.

31:56.263 --> 31:58.362
- I'm here with Diana.
- Oh, come on.

31:58.364 --> 31:59.199
I miss you.

32:03.803 --> 32:10.274
Well, how about we go
on a date next Friday?

32:10.276 --> 32:12.209
I... uh, next Friday, I just...

32:12.211 --> 32:13.778
I've got some plans.

32:13.780 --> 32:18.550
But, I mean, maybe definitely
afterwards, like, I could...

32:18.552 --> 32:20.651
you know, you could like
come through my crib.

32:20.653 --> 32:22.255
Or, like, I could call you or...

32:24.858 --> 32:31.329
Yeah, OK, just let me know.

32:31.331 --> 32:34.366
Um, I'm gonna get some candy.

32:34.368 --> 32:36.201
Do you want anything?

32:36.203 --> 32:37.636
No, I'm...
I'm good.

32:37.638 --> 32:38.736
Just hurry back.

32:38.738 --> 32:39.573
OK.

32:47.313 --> 32:53.952
You don't have any interest
in dating only me, do you?

32:53.954 --> 32:57.488
Oh, uh...

32:57.490 --> 32:58.523
No, it's OK.

32:58.525 --> 32:59.858
It's fine.

32:59.860 --> 33:03.261
I just... I'm having the
realization right now

33:03.263 --> 33:04.663
that... that this is
never going to be

33:04.665 --> 33:06.197
anything more than what it is.

33:06.199 --> 33:07.532
And... and that's fine.

33:07.534 --> 33:12.870
But I'm going to opt out.

33:12.872 --> 33:14.773
Can I just say one more thing?

33:14.775 --> 33:16.308
You're not a bad guy.

33:16.310 --> 33:19.444
But just so you know,
saying that you miss me

33:19.446 --> 33:21.780
or that you really
like me, that is

33:21.782 --> 33:24.482
what makes you not a good guy.

33:24.484 --> 33:27.452
So don't call me, OK?

33:27.454 --> 33:28.653
Yeah, OK.

33:28.655 --> 33:29.457
Great.

33:33.893 --> 33:35.926
So, anyway, that was when
I realized that I would

33:35.928 --> 33:39.563
just never live like my father.

33:39.565 --> 33:40.532
Mm-hmm.

33:40.534 --> 33:41.398
You know what I'm saying?

33:41.400 --> 33:42.934
Mm-hmm.

33:42.936 --> 33:44.336
It was a...

33:44.338 --> 33:45.236
moment for Oh, my
God, I'm so sorry.

33:45.238 --> 33:46.404
...big moment for me.

33:46.406 --> 33:47.906
Adriana, oh, my
God, this is crazy.

33:47.908 --> 33:48.872
Oh, is that...

33:48.874 --> 33:51.443
does she want to hang or...

33:51.445 --> 33:54.245
Oh, well, look who it is.

33:54.247 --> 33:55.246
- Julian.
- Diana.

33:55.248 --> 33:56.013
- Hi.
- Hey.

33:56.015 --> 33:56.915
Hi.

33:56.917 --> 33:57.916
Hi.

33:57.918 --> 33:58.817
What's up?

33:58.819 --> 34:00.517
How are you?

34:00.519 --> 34:01.852
Good, how are you?

34:01.854 --> 34:02.786
I'm good.

34:02.788 --> 34:04.255
Yeah, I'm good.

34:04.257 --> 34:06.791
Ben told me you moved
into his building.

34:06.793 --> 34:09.327
Yes, that happened, yes.

34:09.329 --> 34:11.661
It's weird, right?

34:11.664 --> 34:13.030
Excuse me?

34:13.032 --> 34:14.733
It's weird for you to do that.

34:14.735 --> 34:18.601
It's kind of, like, a crazy
ex-girlfriend thing to do.

34:18.603 --> 34:21.472
I mean, I didn't know that
he live there in the building.

34:21.474 --> 34:23.007
How would you?
How would you?

34:23.010 --> 34:25.676
Exactly, exactly, how would I?

34:25.678 --> 34:29.280
I don't know.

34:29.282 --> 34:30.414
I gotta go.

34:30.416 --> 34:32.585
But, uh, it was
great seeing you.

35:02.648 --> 35:06.617
Hey, you OK?

35:06.619 --> 35:07.619
Yeah?

35:07.621 --> 35:09.019
Yeah.

35:09.021 --> 35:12.756
Tonight wasn't the night, huh?

35:12.758 --> 35:14.626
No.

35:14.628 --> 35:19.064
No, yeah, you want to go
get drunk somewhere else?

35:19.066 --> 35:21.332
- Yes, great, please.
- Let's do it.

35:21.334 --> 35:22.733
Great.

35:22.735 --> 35:23.770
Lead the way, Marie.

36:15.622 --> 36:16.924
Happy Halloween.

36:20.093 --> 36:20.992
Hi.

36:20.994 --> 36:21.829
Hello.

36:24.631 --> 36:27.030
I tripped over a package.

36:27.032 --> 36:28.899
It is addressed to Ben.

36:28.901 --> 36:31.702
Um, this package for...
this is Ben's package.

36:31.704 --> 36:37.508
I just brought it to Ben to
avoid, uh, further dangers.

36:37.510 --> 36:38.410
All right.

36:38.412 --> 36:40.747
So no more trips.

36:42.816 --> 36:44.582
It's for Ben.

36:44.584 --> 36:45.816
I'll give it to him.

36:45.818 --> 36:48.620
Like I just said,
uh, this is Benjamin

36:48.622 --> 36:52.023
Wineburger to set down.

36:52.025 --> 36:52.957
Ow.

36:52.959 --> 36:54.992
I will give it to him.

36:54.994 --> 36:57.562
OK, so great.

36:57.564 --> 37:02.133
I'll trade you for
the candy, all right?

37:02.135 --> 37:04.736
Oh, I don't know
what to do with this.

37:04.738 --> 37:06.704
All right, I'm sorry.

37:06.706 --> 37:09.173
This is banana flavored.

37:09.175 --> 37:10.009
Sick.

37:33.934 --> 37:35.133
Hey, can we slow down?

37:35.135 --> 37:36.733
No, my dad hates
it when I'm late.

37:36.735 --> 37:38.202
Also, uh, make sure
to shake his hand,

37:38.204 --> 37:40.738
like, super firmly because
he hates a weak handshake.

37:40.740 --> 37:43.041
OK, yeah, I...
I have a good handshake.

37:43.043 --> 37:44.175
Just super firm.

37:44.177 --> 37:45.809
- OK, yeah, I mean...
- Um, also...

37:45.811 --> 37:47.111
...I don't want to hurt him.

37:47.113 --> 37:48.111
...make sure you
enunciate, because he really

37:48.113 --> 37:49.079
hates it when people mumble.

37:49.081 --> 37:50.113
I don't... I don't mumble.

37:50.115 --> 37:50.849
I'm not a... I'm not a mumbler.

37:50.851 --> 37:51.783
I mean, I...

37:51.785 --> 37:52.617
- I say things...
- OK.

37:52.619 --> 37:53.550
...pretty clearly.

37:53.552 --> 37:54.885
Yeah.

37:54.887 --> 37:59.990
So, Ben, what
do you want to do?

37:59.992 --> 38:04.495
I'm... I mean, I haven't
totally figured that out yet.

38:04.497 --> 38:06.664
He... he wants
to work in music.

38:06.666 --> 38:09.834
Definitely, still figuring
it out, I have ideas.

38:09.836 --> 38:12.604
Um, I'm not as
organized as Diana.

38:12.606 --> 38:14.539
Oh, yeah, we're
all really excited

38:14.541 --> 38:19.910
about her London adventure,
especially her grandmother.

38:19.912 --> 38:21.646
I mean, she sounds great.

38:21.648 --> 38:23.548
I can't wait to meet her.

38:23.550 --> 38:25.716
Oh, have you planned a trip?

38:25.718 --> 38:29.988
Oh, no, not yet, but
I'd love to go, you know.

38:29.990 --> 38:32.689
There's a ton of music stuff
happening there all the time.

38:32.691 --> 38:36.160
So, you know, and, like,
historically with the Beatles

38:36.162 --> 38:42.002
and, you know, just the
British invasion generally, um.

38:46.572 --> 38:47.838
Do you think you
might move there?

38:47.840 --> 38:50.608
Um, I don't know, maybe.

38:50.610 --> 38:52.142
Hey, are you guys
ready to order?

38:52.144 --> 38:55.780
I'm going to actually just
run to the bathroom quickly.

38:55.782 --> 38:58.749
Oh, it... the bathroom is in
the back of the restaurant.

38:58.751 --> 39:00.017
Oh, OK, great, thank you.

39:00.019 --> 39:01.184
Yeah, I think we're
gonna need a minute.

39:01.186 --> 39:02.120
That's fine.

39:02.122 --> 39:03.320
OK, thank you.

39:03.322 --> 39:03.923
Thanks.

39:07.626 --> 39:08.926
So he might move with you?

39:08.928 --> 39:10.294
I... I have no idea
where that came from.

39:10.296 --> 39:12.963
I... yeah, I don't know
why he even said that.

39:12.965 --> 39:14.999
We... we haven't discussed that.

39:15.001 --> 39:17.669
Well, what have you discussed?

39:17.671 --> 39:20.704
Nothing, really.

39:20.706 --> 39:23.975
OK, well, you need
to think this through.

39:23.977 --> 39:25.676
I know, Dad.

39:25.678 --> 39:27.144
Because if he's thinking
about moving there for you...

39:27.146 --> 39:27.947
Yeah, I know.

39:31.885 --> 39:34.184
I just don't want you
to be in a situation

39:34.186 --> 39:37.021
where you're rushing into
some big commitment at a time

39:37.023 --> 39:38.823
when you should be
focusing on your writing...

39:38.825 --> 39:39.724
Dad, I am focused.

39:39.726 --> 39:40.858
...and yourself.

39:40.860 --> 39:41.892
And I'm not saying
that you can't

39:41.894 --> 39:42.961
find a way to make this work.

39:42.963 --> 39:46.664
Just be sensible.

39:46.666 --> 39:48.099
I don't want you to get stuck.

39:48.101 --> 39:51.836
Mm, mm-hmm.

39:51.838 --> 39:53.838
So, uh, they had some
mints in the bathroom.

39:53.840 --> 39:59.077
I thought I'd, uh, for
later, you know, after,

39:59.079 --> 40:00.345
after-brunch mints.

40:00.347 --> 40:01.312
I'm just gonna...

40:01.314 --> 40:02.847
I'll put them in my purse.

40:02.849 --> 40:04.148
- Yeah, that's great.
- Do you want to order?

40:04.150 --> 40:05.119
- Yeah, let's order.
- OK.

40:20.767 --> 40:23.200
One, two, three, four,
you really just want to keep

40:23.202 --> 40:24.968
your heart rate up for now.

40:24.970 --> 40:26.037
And then after this, we'll do
some stretching and strength

40:26.039 --> 40:27.171
work.
Just follow along.

40:27.173 --> 40:28.673
OK, hip rolls.

40:28.675 --> 40:29.707
Oh, wait.

40:29.709 --> 40:31.242
I have... I have a bit of news.

40:31.244 --> 40:32.644
What is it?

40:32.646 --> 40:33.745
Um, I have been
asked to be in a play.

40:33.747 --> 40:34.678
When?

40:34.680 --> 40:36.213
It's just one night.

40:36.215 --> 40:37.814
It's just a little benefit,
but I think it will be fun.

40:37.816 --> 40:39.283
What's it about?

40:39.285 --> 40:41.753
It's about a husband and
wife who... you know what?

40:41.755 --> 40:43.021
I want you to be surprised.

40:43.023 --> 40:44.756
- But will you come?
- Yes, I will come.

40:44.758 --> 40:45.957
What?
When is it?

40:45.959 --> 40:46.890
In a month.

40:46.892 --> 40:49.126
OK, this is amazing.

40:49.128 --> 40:50.193
I'm going to
get us some water.

40:50.195 --> 40:52.031
OK, I'd really
like some water.

40:54.034 --> 40:55.700
- Keep hip rolling.
- All right.

40:56.669 --> 40:58.001
Oh, could you get it?

40:58.003 --> 40:58.838
OK.

41:03.776 --> 41:04.809
Hey.

41:04.811 --> 41:05.843
Hey.

41:05.845 --> 41:08.012
What's up?

41:08.014 --> 41:11.716
Uh, I just wanted to make
sure everything was OK.

41:11.718 --> 41:13.917
I heard a lot of banging and...

41:13.919 --> 41:16.320
Oh, yeah, uh, sorry.

41:16.322 --> 41:19.791
Um, I'll put a yoga
mat down or something.

41:19.793 --> 41:20.892
Great, thanks.

41:20.894 --> 41:22.727
Sure.

41:22.729 --> 41:23.894
Also.

41:23.896 --> 41:26.296
Yes?

41:26.298 --> 41:29.767
Do you think you could
back off Ben a little bit?

41:29.769 --> 41:30.702
I'm sorry.

41:30.704 --> 41:32.403
What?

41:32.405 --> 41:34.338
I am trying to
be cool with you.

41:34.340 --> 41:36.774
I just am not an idiot,
and I see what you're

41:36.776 --> 41:39.776
doing, always hanging around.

41:39.778 --> 41:44.448
Um, yeah, I'm not, uh,
always hanging around.

41:44.450 --> 41:48.218
I live here.

41:48.220 --> 41:51.122
Uh, yeah, I can just
see you when you're

41:51.124 --> 41:54.158
creeping outside his window.

41:54.160 --> 41:56.494
Yeah, um, I'm sorry.

41:56.496 --> 41:58.129
I really don't know what
you're talking about.

41:58.131 --> 42:02.767
Um, I've been sweeping
out front as of late.

42:02.769 --> 42:05.436
Maybe you've seen me
sweeping leaves, um,

42:05.438 --> 42:08.872
but definitely not creeping.

42:08.874 --> 42:11.508
OK.

42:11.510 --> 42:14.479
Well, maybe you'll
stop jumping then.

42:14.481 --> 42:16.314
Uh, yeah, we will totally...

42:16.316 --> 42:19.350
we'll do our best
to keep it down.

42:19.352 --> 42:20.852
Great, thanks.

42:20.854 --> 42:21.818
Sure.

42:21.820 --> 42:22.456
Bye.

42:28.961 --> 42:30.495
What did she want?

42:30.497 --> 42:31.932
Uh, she's out of her mind.

42:33.198 --> 42:34.765
What happened?

42:34.767 --> 42:37.901
She think I'm creeping on Ben.

42:37.903 --> 42:39.202
Are you creeping on Ben?

42:39.204 --> 42:40.872
No, I'm not creeping on Ben.

42:40.874 --> 42:42.807
OK.

42:42.809 --> 42:43.941
Why is it a
crime to want to be

42:43.943 --> 42:44.975
friends with your ex-boyfriend?

42:44.977 --> 42:46.544
It's not a crime.

42:46.546 --> 42:47.381
It's just a question.

42:52.885 --> 42:54.053
Whatever, she's great.

43:20.880 --> 43:22.914
Hello.

43:22.916 --> 43:25.816
Good morning, angel.

43:25.818 --> 43:27.251
No, no, no, he's awake.

43:29.354 --> 43:30.821
We had the best time last night.

43:30.823 --> 43:33.490
Dad was just saying how
romantic it all was.

43:33.492 --> 43:36.026
It was very, very
special for us.

43:36.028 --> 43:37.861
OK, that sounds wonderful.

43:37.863 --> 43:39.095
I'll see you in a
bit, sweet girl.

43:39.097 --> 43:40.030
I love you.

43:40.032 --> 43:42.899
No, I love you.

43:43.869 --> 43:45.202
You were amazing.

43:45.204 --> 43:47.137
Oh, you're crazy.

43:47.139 --> 43:48.171
Thank you very much.

43:48.173 --> 43:49.439
You were... these are for you.

43:49.441 --> 43:52.142
Oh, they're... these
are so beautiful.

43:52.144 --> 43:53.311
You are so beautiful.

43:53.313 --> 43:55.178
Wow, wow, wow,
thank you very much.

43:55.180 --> 43:57.247
I'm just relieved.

43:57.249 --> 43:59.550
Would you... would you guys
like to come to the party?

43:59.552 --> 44:02.320
I hear that there's going to
be cotton candy and steak.

44:02.322 --> 44:03.620
Wow.

44:03.622 --> 44:05.488
Separately, of course,
but both delicious.

44:05.490 --> 44:06.990
That is a dynamite
combination.

44:06.992 --> 44:08.258
- That's amazing.
- Right?

44:08.260 --> 44:09.559
Yes.

44:09.561 --> 44:11.896
Um, I would so love to,
but I have to work...

44:11.898 --> 44:13.164
- Oh.
- ...early.

44:13.166 --> 44:14.332
- OK.
- I'm sorry.

44:14.334 --> 44:15.566
Yeah, I have to
work, too, Amy.

44:15.568 --> 44:16.901
- I'm sorry.
- All right.

44:16.903 --> 44:18.169
But you were...
you were so good.

44:18.171 --> 44:19.437
Thank you.

44:19.439 --> 44:21.037
You are... are so nice,
and get home safe.

44:21.039 --> 44:22.506
OK.

44:22.508 --> 44:26.276
And don't wait for me,
'cause I'm going to go party.

44:26.278 --> 44:27.378
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

44:27.380 --> 44:28.546
Hard.

44:28.548 --> 44:29.546
- Go party so hardy.
- I'm going to.

44:29.548 --> 44:30.981
You better.

44:30.983 --> 44:31.916
- You deserve it.
- Bye.

44:31.918 --> 44:32.649
- Bye.
- Congrats.

44:32.651 --> 44:34.117
Congratulations.

44:34.119 --> 44:35.186
Thank you so much
for coming, you guys.

44:35.188 --> 44:35.988
All right.

44:42.128 --> 44:45.528
I, um, well, I'm... we're
both going this way, right?

44:45.530 --> 44:46.430
Do you want to...

44:46.432 --> 44:48.499
Yeah, sure.

44:48.501 --> 44:49.336
OK.

44:58.410 --> 44:59.510
So hungry.

44:59.512 --> 45:00.347
Yeah, me, too.

45:10.322 --> 45:12.289
Um, listen.

45:12.291 --> 45:13.658
We don't have to.

45:13.660 --> 45:17.495
Uh, but I know this really
great Italian place.

45:17.497 --> 45:21.599
It's just around the
corner, if you want to.

45:21.601 --> 45:23.100
Uh...

45:23.102 --> 45:24.501
We don't... you know,
we don't have to.

45:24.503 --> 45:27.972
Yeah, no, let's do it.

45:27.974 --> 45:28.705
Yeah, OK.

45:28.707 --> 45:30.474
Get... get Italian food.

45:30.476 --> 45:33.510
Yeah, great, let's get... yeah,
it's just, um, it's up here.

45:33.512 --> 45:34.514
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

45:41.688 --> 45:44.488
It's been so cold.

45:44.490 --> 45:48.626
Yeah, uh, yeah,
yeah, it's almost...

45:48.628 --> 45:51.062
almost winter, basically.

45:51.064 --> 45:53.997
Yeah.

45:53.999 --> 45:56.233
So how are you?

45:56.235 --> 45:57.635
Oh, I'm...
I'm good.

45:57.637 --> 45:59.336
- Good.
- Thanks.

45:59.338 --> 46:02.173
Yeah, I hear you've been
making music, and... and that

46:02.175 --> 46:03.106
it's going really well.

46:03.108 --> 46:04.374
It's still a struggle.

46:04.376 --> 46:08.312
But, yeah, I mean,
it's going pretty well.

46:08.314 --> 46:09.446
I'm... I'm on the road.

46:09.448 --> 46:11.148
Wait.
You're touring?

46:11.150 --> 46:12.149
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

46:12.151 --> 46:13.383
I meant the figurative road.

46:13.385 --> 46:15.218
I can see how that
would be misleading.

46:15.220 --> 46:18.521
Um, I'm... I'm working
in commercials.

46:18.523 --> 46:20.057
That's great.

46:20.059 --> 46:20.758
Yeah.

46:20.760 --> 46:22.292
Ben, that's great.

46:22.294 --> 46:23.494
Thanks.

46:23.496 --> 46:26.229
Yeah, I'm... I'm
really happy for you.

46:26.231 --> 46:28.733
Thank you.

46:28.735 --> 46:30.568
How are you?

46:30.570 --> 46:32.336
Um, yeah, I'm...

46:32.338 --> 46:33.470
I'm, um...

46:33.472 --> 46:35.539
You guys want
anything to drink?

46:35.541 --> 46:37.008
Uh, yes.

46:37.010 --> 46:39.142
I would love a glass
of your house red

46:39.144 --> 46:41.512
and just some lemon
for my water, please.

46:41.514 --> 46:43.580
We have no lemons.

46:43.582 --> 46:44.749
You don't have lemons?

46:44.751 --> 46:46.149
Nope.

46:46.151 --> 46:47.417
I'm sorry.

46:47.419 --> 46:48.988
But you have lemon
risotto on your menu.

46:50.222 --> 46:51.187
Lemons
only for the food.

46:51.189 --> 46:52.222
So you do have lemons?

46:52.224 --> 46:53.224
We do.

46:53.226 --> 46:54.624
Do you want a lemon risotto?

46:54.626 --> 46:56.359
No.

46:56.361 --> 46:57.695
No, thank you.

46:57.697 --> 47:00.131
I... I just want a slice
of lemon for my water.

47:00.133 --> 47:03.466
Well, the lemons
are only for the food.

47:03.468 --> 47:05.102
Right.

47:05.104 --> 47:09.673
Uh, OK, I... I will just
have the wine then, please.

47:09.675 --> 47:11.075
OK.

47:11.077 --> 47:12.075
Oh, yeah, I'll have...

47:12.077 --> 47:13.209
I'll have the same.

47:13.211 --> 47:16.349
OK, so two wines, zero lemons.

47:22.088 --> 47:23.086
I wonder if they have lemons.

47:24.456 --> 47:25.655
I wanted to ask him.

47:25.657 --> 47:27.624
You should have asked.

47:27.626 --> 47:29.028
He'll be back.

47:37.470 --> 47:39.836
What?

47:39.838 --> 47:42.405
Nothing.

47:42.407 --> 47:44.475
Nothing, I'm gonna do the bread.

47:44.477 --> 47:45.376
Yeah, let's do the bread.

47:45.378 --> 47:46.443
Yeah.

47:46.445 --> 47:47.544
Dare I ask for butter?

47:47.546 --> 47:48.512
- I wouldn't.
- Yeah, no.

47:48.514 --> 47:49.446
Yeah.

47:49.448 --> 47:50.381
I'm not gonna do it.

47:50.383 --> 47:52.615
Butter is for cooking.

47:52.617 --> 47:57.387
I mean, what's inside a banana
is... is the banana's business.

47:57.389 --> 47:59.856
There's no name for it.

47:59.858 --> 48:01.358
Oh, no, we don't...

48:01.360 --> 48:03.126
we don't... just that's
not our business.

48:03.128 --> 48:04.394
You're right.

48:04.396 --> 48:06.796
OK, but how many A's
are there in banana?

48:06.798 --> 48:08.265
Seriously, like...

48:08.267 --> 48:09.499
Like, 15.

48:09.501 --> 48:10.600
...realistically,
there are, like, 20.

48:10.602 --> 48:11.869
- Yeah, 15...
- No, like, 20.

48:11.871 --> 48:13.570
I get... I'm actually
being serious.

48:13.572 --> 48:14.604
I get it.

48:14.606 --> 48:16.372
I do this all the time when I...

48:16.374 --> 48:18.175
like, when I'm reading.

48:18.177 --> 48:19.709
I lose sight of
words completely.

48:19.711 --> 48:21.479
- Right?
- Yes, yes.

48:21.481 --> 48:23.446
- OK, so I'm not alone here.
- You're not alone in the world.

48:23.448 --> 48:24.582
- Thank you.
- I'm...

48:24.584 --> 48:25.515
- Thank you.
- I'm here.

48:25.517 --> 48:26.119
I needed that.

48:29.421 --> 48:31.222
Amy was incredible tonight.

48:31.224 --> 48:33.490
Yeah, yeah, she's...

48:33.492 --> 48:35.325
she's, like, really good.

48:35.327 --> 48:36.162
Yeah.

48:39.764 --> 48:43.533
Is, um, Meg just
not a theater fan?

48:43.535 --> 48:47.441
Um, uh, we broke up.

48:52.811 --> 48:53.744
Shit.

48:53.746 --> 48:55.546
I'm so sorry.

48:55.548 --> 48:57.481
Oh, it's OK.

48:57.483 --> 49:02.452
I, um, I didn't know.

49:02.454 --> 49:03.454
I'm sorry.

49:03.456 --> 49:05.559
No, it's... it's really OK.

49:12.831 --> 49:14.398
Well, this is me.

49:14.400 --> 49:17.734
This is you.

49:17.736 --> 49:21.405
Uh, well, it was really
nice hanging out with you.

49:21.407 --> 49:23.809
Yeah, um, yeah, I
had a really nice time.

49:38.356 --> 49:39.258
No, Ben.

49:42.394 --> 49:43.195
Um.

49:49.267 --> 49:51.434
You know you flirt
with me, right?

49:51.436 --> 49:52.369
What?

49:52.371 --> 49:55.372
I... no, I don't.

49:55.374 --> 49:59.309
I thought... um, I thought
you had a girlfriend

49:59.311 --> 50:00.811
until, like, 90 seconds ago.

50:00.813 --> 50:02.278
OK, I don't get it.

50:02.280 --> 50:04.981
I mean, what... what
do you want from me?

50:04.983 --> 50:06.684
I... I just want
to be your friend.

50:06.686 --> 50:08.651
OK, uh, I feel like...

50:08.653 --> 50:10.653
I feel like we've
been through this.

50:10.655 --> 50:11.757
I can't be friends with you.

50:29.307 --> 50:31.341
Ben.

50:31.343 --> 50:32.178
Ben.

50:48.894 --> 50:50.494
Does my tongue
look weird to you?

50:51.896 --> 50:54.898
Uh, all tongues
look weird, Diana.

50:54.900 --> 50:56.432
Yeah, no, I know.

50:56.434 --> 51:01.437
But, like, why does it
have that brownish tint?

51:01.439 --> 51:03.340
I think you... didn't
you just have coffee?

51:03.342 --> 51:05.908
Yeah.

51:05.910 --> 51:06.977
Or you're dying.

51:06.979 --> 51:09.946
Oh, yeah.

51:09.948 --> 51:11.347
You're probably dying.

51:11.349 --> 51:12.349
Am I dying?

51:12.351 --> 51:13.887
More than likely, I'm doing.

51:17.456 --> 51:20.791
No, no, no, what
are you doing?

51:20.793 --> 51:21.892
That is not a fun game.

51:21.894 --> 51:22.825
It's not a fun game?

51:22.827 --> 51:23.630
No.

51:27.867 --> 51:31.001
OK, OK, this is... this
is actually great.

51:31.003 --> 51:32.336
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

51:32.338 --> 51:33.537
Can I?

51:33.539 --> 51:34.838
- Please, keep doing this.
- OK.

51:34.840 --> 51:35.972
This is nice.

51:35.974 --> 51:37.576
This is a friendly game.

51:55.561 --> 51:56.959
Well, why not?

51:56.961 --> 51:58.831
Just because
you don't do that.

52:02.601 --> 52:03.499
Turn it off.

52:03.501 --> 52:04.568
Turn it off.

52:04.570 --> 52:05.568
- Hello.
- Hi.

52:05.570 --> 52:06.570
How are you?

52:06.572 --> 52:07.470
Hi.

52:08.773 --> 52:10.506
Barry, nice to meet you.

52:10.508 --> 52:11.408
How was your drive up?

52:11.410 --> 52:12.542
It was lovely.

52:12.544 --> 52:13.876
Here, meet...
meet... meet Diana.

52:13.878 --> 52:15.345
Diana, I'm Shannon.

52:15.347 --> 52:16.546
- And you are?
- Hello.

52:16.548 --> 52:17.680
Hello.
I'm Ben.

52:17.682 --> 52:18.749
- Moisha.
- It was wonderful.

52:18.751 --> 52:20.517
Moisha, nice to
see you, Moisha.

52:20.519 --> 52:21.651
You look good.

52:21.653 --> 52:23.387
You look very good.

52:23.389 --> 52:24.722
- Thank you for having me.
- All right, let's go inside.

52:24.724 --> 52:26.023
- Come on.
- Are you cold?

52:26.025 --> 52:27.758
Any... any issues with the car?

52:27.760 --> 52:29.093
- Oh, it smells so good.
- Uh, no.

52:29.095 --> 52:30.561
- Did you check the oil?
- Was he a good driver?

52:30.563 --> 52:31.628
- Did you get my text?
- Yes.

52:31.630 --> 52:33.062
I... OK.

52:33.064 --> 52:34.497
You're not supposed to
text him when he's driving.

52:43.776 --> 52:44.774
Please, start.

52:44.776 --> 52:45.776
Everybody, just dig in.

52:45.778 --> 52:46.977
It looks very good.

52:46.979 --> 52:47.945
Do you want some of this?

52:47.947 --> 52:49.445
Uh, yeah.

52:49.447 --> 52:52.615
Diana, these potatoes
are unbelievable.

52:52.617 --> 52:53.950
I don't know how she does it.

52:53.952 --> 52:55.551
Oh, thank you.

52:55.553 --> 52:56.553
Butter, if it's good,

52:56.555 --> 52:57.588
it's always butter.

52:57.590 --> 52:58.888
That's so true.

52:58.890 --> 52:59.990
Diana loves butta.

52:59.992 --> 53:01.858
I do.

53:01.860 --> 53:04.026
I don't like butter,
but I love butta.

53:04.028 --> 53:04.928
Try the potatoes.

53:04.930 --> 53:09.399
OK, let's see.

53:09.401 --> 53:12.001
Oh, my God, these are so good.

53:12.003 --> 53:14.570
Good.

53:14.572 --> 53:16.874
That's why we've been
together for 30 years.

53:16.876 --> 53:19.542
30 years.

53:19.544 --> 53:20.878
30 years, that's amazing.

53:20.880 --> 53:22.845
We were your age when we met.

53:22.847 --> 53:24.680
Aw.

53:24.682 --> 53:27.084
And I have to tell
you, we still know how

53:27.086 --> 53:29.119
to shmear each other's bagels.

53:29.121 --> 53:30.187
Dad...

53:30.189 --> 53:31.088
- If you get my meaning.
- Dad.

53:31.090 --> 53:32.423
- Barry.
- No, stop.

53:32.425 --> 53:33.423
Of course, we get your meaning.

53:33.425 --> 53:34.892
Barry, don't embarrass him.

53:34.894 --> 53:36.126
We're still
madly in love...

53:36.128 --> 53:37.794
- No, it's...
- ...with each other.

53:37.796 --> 53:38.995
- That's what marriage...
- Oh, speak for yourself.

53:38.997 --> 53:39.863
We're crazy
about each other.

53:39.865 --> 53:40.997
Speak for yourself.

53:40.999 --> 53:41.731
- I'm crazy about you.
- Mm-hmm.

53:41.733 --> 53:42.733
I love you.

53:42.735 --> 53:43.666
- Mm-hmm.
- I love you.

53:43.668 --> 53:44.600
Mm-hmm.

53:44.602 --> 53:45.635
He's OK.

53:45.637 --> 53:46.537
I'm OK.

53:46.539 --> 53:47.407
Yeah, just OK.

53:51.142 --> 53:52.575
I'm really glad you came.

53:52.577 --> 53:54.977
Oh, me, too, thank
you for having me.

53:54.979 --> 53:56.416
It's nice to see Ben so happy.

53:59.985 --> 54:02.785
Can I say something to you?

54:02.787 --> 54:04.021
Yeah, of course.

54:04.023 --> 54:04.657
OK.

54:07.927 --> 54:09.593
I know I shouldn't say anything.

54:09.595 --> 54:18.135
But he told me that you
seemed confused about what

54:18.137 --> 54:21.838
to do when you move to London.

54:21.840 --> 54:28.845
I just... be sensitive.

54:28.847 --> 54:29.847
Just be careful with him.

54:29.849 --> 54:30.650
Can you do that?

54:34.586 --> 54:36.553
Yea... yes, yeah, of course.

54:36.555 --> 54:37.488
Thank you very much.

54:37.490 --> 54:38.988
Yeah.

54:38.990 --> 54:42.825
Um, I'm going to get the
boys for the pots and pans.

54:42.827 --> 54:44.831
Barry, Barry.

54:48.901 --> 54:50.501
Hey.

54:50.503 --> 54:51.767
Hey.

54:51.769 --> 54:54.570
My mom put Hanukkah
gelt on our pillows.

54:54.572 --> 54:56.273
How sweet is that?

54:56.275 --> 55:04.013
That is very
sweet, very sweet.

55:04.015 --> 55:06.617
Come here.

55:06.619 --> 55:07.550
Hi.

55:07.552 --> 55:08.153
Hi.

55:13.559 --> 55:15.892
Did you have fun today?

55:15.894 --> 55:18.961
Yeah, yeah.

55:18.963 --> 55:22.032
I know my parents
can be a little much,

55:22.034 --> 55:25.301
but they mean well.

55:25.303 --> 55:26.637
They're great.

55:26.639 --> 55:28.771
They're great.

55:28.773 --> 55:30.240
I had a great time.

55:30.242 --> 55:32.245
Good, they loved you.

55:35.247 --> 55:36.716
That... that's so nice.

55:39.718 --> 55:40.720
I really like them.

55:49.762 --> 55:51.093
Hey.

55:51.095 --> 55:57.133
Um, why did you tell my
dad that you might move?

55:57.135 --> 56:01.671
Uh, that was kind
of a while ago.

56:01.673 --> 56:02.705
I don't know.

56:02.707 --> 56:05.677
Um, I've been thinking about it.

56:08.247 --> 56:13.916
I guess I just don't know
how, um, it would work legally,

56:13.918 --> 56:17.921
you know, uh, because
I'm a dual citizen.

56:17.923 --> 56:20.923
But you're not, and it's
quite hard to get a job there

56:20.925 --> 56:21.858
if you're not sponsored.

56:21.860 --> 56:23.994
And so I...

56:23.996 --> 56:27.263
I just didn't know how it
would work legally for you.

56:27.265 --> 56:31.934
Yeah, I mean, I hadn't thought
it through, like, legally.

56:31.936 --> 56:35.071
I guess it just... it felt
like a really big thing for you

56:35.073 --> 56:39.376
to bring up at lunch
with my dad when

56:39.378 --> 56:41.044
you hadn't met him
yet and... and we

56:41.046 --> 56:42.845
hadn't even discussed it yet.

56:42.847 --> 56:45.916
And, um...

56:45.918 --> 56:48.151
OK.

56:48.153 --> 56:49.988
I just, like, just...

56:53.025 --> 56:56.760
we'll have to figure it out.

56:56.762 --> 57:01.798
Yeah, yes, you're right.

57:01.800 --> 57:02.765
We'll figure it out.

57:02.767 --> 57:03.666
You're right.

57:03.668 --> 57:04.401
I'm sorry.

57:04.403 --> 57:06.870
We'll be fine.

57:06.872 --> 57:07.674
Don't worry.

57:12.244 --> 57:13.079
OK.

57:21.753 --> 57:24.854
I love you.

57:24.856 --> 57:25.657
I love you.

57:37.735 --> 57:39.202
Do you want to turn those off?

57:39.204 --> 57:40.039
Yeah.

57:50.715 --> 57:52.215
Ah, there you go.

57:52.217 --> 57:53.019
Tada.

57:55.720 --> 57:56.852
Nice.

57:56.854 --> 57:57.854
Nice.

57:57.856 --> 57:58.825
It's a good tree.

58:01.427 --> 58:04.461
You know, this was Patrick's
favorite time of year, the...

58:04.463 --> 58:05.428
the beginning of winter.

58:05.430 --> 58:07.097
Oh, yeah?

58:07.099 --> 58:11.801
Looking forward to the
first snow and all that, yeah.

58:11.803 --> 58:15.204
You know, today is
our anniversary.

58:15.206 --> 58:16.773
No?

58:16.775 --> 58:21.845
Yeah, he proposed after
three months, my God.

58:21.847 --> 58:23.180
- And you said yes.
- I did.

58:27.352 --> 58:29.352
When did you know you
wanted to marry him?

58:29.354 --> 58:31.021
Oh, I don't know.

58:31.023 --> 58:33.055
I'm not sure it was a
conscious realization.

58:33.057 --> 58:36.258
When he first asked me to
marry him, yes came right out.

58:36.260 --> 58:38.294
I figured if that was
my first instinct,

58:38.296 --> 58:40.129
I shouldn't overthink it.

58:40.131 --> 58:41.865
I mean, I didn't
know that we would

58:41.867 --> 58:44.166
be together for so many years.

58:44.168 --> 58:45.267
I hoped we would.

58:45.269 --> 58:46.970
But I just knew
that I loved him,

58:46.972 --> 58:49.271
and I thought I'd like to
try to being married to him.

58:49.273 --> 58:50.974
And...

58:55.981 --> 58:57.881
Well, happy anniversary.

58:57.883 --> 58:58.718
Thank you.

59:03.188 --> 59:06.092
It's just it sucks that he died.

59:08.760 --> 59:09.461
Yeah, it does.

59:15.099 --> 59:17.066
Should we try and find some
rice cakes and peanut butter?

59:17.068 --> 59:18.468
Absolutely.

59:18.470 --> 59:19.803
I could go for some rice
cakes and peanut butter.

59:19.805 --> 59:20.970
Look, I want all of them.

59:20.972 --> 59:22.271
Yeah.

59:22.273 --> 59:23.173
I want all the rice
cakes and peanut butter.

59:24.910 --> 59:26.345
I think I have some.

59:36.155 --> 59:38.088
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

59:38.090 --> 59:39.923
Ben is now going
to leave his lease.

59:39.925 --> 59:41.461
So there will be some new
leases coming up, FYI.

59:45.831 --> 59:48.198
That's great.

59:48.200 --> 59:49.432
That's great.

59:49.434 --> 59:53.269
Um, that will make
life so much easier.

59:53.271 --> 59:55.070
We'll make
sure his replacement

59:55.072 --> 59:58.207
isn't someone you've dated.

59:58.209 --> 01:00:00.010
Yeah, yes, please.

01:00:00.012 --> 01:00:00.847
Thank you.

01:00:04.916 --> 01:00:07.252
This... this is great news.

01:00:13.358 --> 01:00:16.358
Yeah, well, this one time
I was on the six train.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:17.426
And there was a break dancer...

01:00:17.428 --> 01:00:18.495
Mm-hmm.

01:00:18.497 --> 01:00:20.162
- ...like, on the pole...
- Yeah.

01:00:20.164 --> 01:00:22.064
...doing a crazy move.
And he spun around.

01:00:22.066 --> 01:00:23.499
I was like, this is so annoying.

01:00:23.501 --> 01:00:27.403
And I realized it was Max,
my RA from freshman year

01:00:27.405 --> 01:00:29.539
who I hooked up with.

01:00:29.541 --> 01:00:31.106
What's up?

01:00:31.108 --> 01:00:31.943
What?

01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:35.278
What's up?

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:37.379
Uh, nothing.

01:00:37.381 --> 01:00:38.381
Wait.

01:00:38.383 --> 01:00:40.182
You hooked up with your RA?

01:00:40.184 --> 01:00:44.287
Yeah, I told
you that, I think.

01:00:44.289 --> 01:00:47.023
Oh, have so much
fun with your sister.

01:00:47.025 --> 01:00:48.992
I will, and I will see
you in a couple of weeks.

01:00:48.994 --> 01:00:50.961
- OK.
- Please, be careful.

01:00:50.963 --> 01:00:51.861
I'm going to be so warm.

01:00:51.863 --> 01:00:53.162
Don't slip.

01:00:53.164 --> 01:00:54.330
Oh, my God, please, be
warm for both of us.

01:00:54.332 --> 01:00:56.166
- I will, bye.
- OK.

01:00:56.168 --> 01:00:57.867
Oh, shoot, I forgot
to take the trash our.

01:00:57.869 --> 01:01:00.236
Oh, I'll get it when
I, um, water your pants.

01:01:00.238 --> 01:01:01.403
I'll do it when I come home.

01:01:01.405 --> 01:01:02.439
Are you sure?

01:01:02.441 --> 01:01:03.539
Yes, go.

01:01:03.541 --> 01:01:04.474
OK.

01:01:04.476 --> 01:01:05.374
Yes.

01:01:05.376 --> 01:01:06.642
OK, thank you, doll.

01:01:06.644 --> 01:01:09.512
OK, call me if anything
terrible happens.

01:01:27.398 --> 01:01:28.597
Trash.

01:01:45.082 --> 01:01:46.582
Ow.

01:01:46.584 --> 01:01:47.452
Oh, my God, are you OK?

01:01:50.354 --> 01:01:51.320
Yeah, no, I'm good.

01:01:51.322 --> 01:01:53.323
Oh, shit, Diana, oh, my...

01:01:53.325 --> 01:01:54.524
- No, I'm fine.
- Um.

01:01:54.526 --> 01:01:55.992
I'm fine.

01:01:55.994 --> 01:01:57.294
Just hang out for,
like, uh, a minute.

01:01:57.296 --> 01:01:59.162
I'm going to... I'm
going to get my jacket,

01:01:59.164 --> 01:02:00.430
and we're going
to get into a cab.

01:02:00.432 --> 01:02:04.533
I don't... where did
the blood come from?

01:02:04.535 --> 01:02:06.236
OK, the doctor
will be in in a minute.

01:02:06.238 --> 01:02:07.169
OK, thank you.

01:02:07.171 --> 01:02:07.974
Mm-hmm.

01:02:12.543 --> 01:02:14.577
Hey, why were
you there tonight?

01:02:14.579 --> 01:02:18.948
I was just cleaning, you know,
before I give my keys back.

01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:20.086
Right, right.

01:02:23.188 --> 01:02:25.488
Thank you for, um, thank
you for bringing me.

01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:27.256
You didn't have to do that.

01:02:27.258 --> 01:02:28.191
Thanks.

01:02:28.193 --> 01:02:29.294
Yeah, of course.

01:02:30.428 --> 01:02:31.995
Diana, I'm Dr. Maples.

01:02:31.997 --> 01:02:33.229
Hi.

01:02:33.231 --> 01:02:34.463
I hear you
had a bit of a fall.

01:02:34.465 --> 01:02:35.668
Uh, yes, I slipped
on some black ice.

01:02:37.168 --> 01:02:38.200
OK, we're
going to send you

01:02:38.202 --> 01:02:39.468
down to x-ray for your ankle.

01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:41.704
But first we're going
to get a nice look

01:02:41.706 --> 01:02:44.106
at that gash on your forehead.

01:02:44.108 --> 01:02:47.010
OK, um, so I was
thinking maybe we

01:02:47.012 --> 01:02:49.144
could just glue it,
because I remember this one

01:02:49.146 --> 01:02:50.280
time when I was little.

01:02:50.282 --> 01:02:52.448
I cut my finger,
and they glued it.

01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:53.983
And it worked really well.

01:02:53.985 --> 01:02:55.251
So I was thinking maybe
we could just do that.

01:02:55.253 --> 01:02:56.586
Yeah, the reason
that we can't glue it

01:02:56.588 --> 01:02:58.021
is because of its depth.

01:02:58.023 --> 01:02:59.521
The glue only works
for shallow cuts.

01:02:59.523 --> 01:03:03.325
For deep ones, I have
to really get in there.

01:03:03.327 --> 01:03:04.760
You OK?

01:03:04.762 --> 01:03:10.399
Um, mm-hmm, I'm just
not that good with, um,

01:03:10.401 --> 01:03:14.403
needles or pain or
just really anything

01:03:14.405 --> 01:03:17.173
that's happening right now.

01:03:17.175 --> 01:03:18.675
All right, I'm going
to do it right now.

01:03:18.677 --> 01:03:19.575
Don't move.

01:03:19.577 --> 01:03:21.510
OK.

01:03:21.512 --> 01:03:24.213
Hey, I think you're
going to make it.

01:03:24.215 --> 01:03:26.416
I can't be... I can't be sure.

01:03:26.418 --> 01:03:28.084
But things are looking good.

01:03:28.086 --> 01:03:30.220
What is it, like, 75%?

01:03:30.222 --> 01:03:33.523
I'm going to go with, like,
I'm going to go with 80%.

01:03:33.525 --> 01:03:36.158
OK, 80% is good.

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:37.260
He seems to be a real doctor.

01:03:37.262 --> 01:03:38.528
80% is a good percentage.

01:03:38.530 --> 01:03:40.463
He looks like an
actual medical doctor.

01:04:05.322 --> 01:04:06.356
Hey.

01:04:06.358 --> 01:04:07.323
I'm making scrambled eggs.

01:04:07.325 --> 01:04:08.127
Do you want some?

01:04:11.162 --> 01:04:12.528
Hey.

01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:13.562
Can I sit down?

01:04:13.564 --> 01:04:14.367
Yeah.

01:04:19.438 --> 01:04:21.236
What's going on?

01:04:21.238 --> 01:04:24.173
Hey.

01:04:24.175 --> 01:04:25.010
Are you OK?

01:04:28.113 --> 01:04:28.748
Hey.

01:04:33.385 --> 01:04:35.151
Diana, are you OK?
Are

01:04:35.153 --> 01:04:35.852
Are you OK?

01:04:35.854 --> 01:04:36.689
What's going on?

01:04:40.191 --> 01:04:41.091
Hey.

01:04:41.093 --> 01:04:43.361
What... what happened?

01:04:46.398 --> 01:04:47.530
Diana, what happened?

01:04:47.532 --> 01:04:50.600
Yeah, I think we
should break up.

01:04:50.602 --> 01:04:51.404
What?

01:04:58.410 --> 01:05:02.648
What, are... are you
breaking up with me?

01:05:05.349 --> 01:05:06.316
Yeah.

01:05:06.318 --> 01:05:07.153
What?

01:05:17.528 --> 01:05:18.695
- Ben, I'm...
- I don't...

01:05:18.697 --> 01:05:19.629
I'm leaving.

01:05:19.631 --> 01:05:20.662
I kno...

01:05:20.664 --> 01:05:21.698
I know.

01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:23.265
You... we... we talked about this.

01:05:23.267 --> 01:05:24.200
We didn't.

01:05:24.202 --> 01:05:26.135
Yes, uh, it's fine.

01:05:26.137 --> 01:05:27.169
Like, we're gonna work it out.

01:05:27.171 --> 01:05:28.704
We didn't talk about it.

01:05:28.706 --> 01:05:30.472
Yeah, we definitely... we
definitely talked about it, OK?

01:05:30.474 --> 01:05:33.475
And, like, it's... you know,
it's just a couple of years.

01:05:33.477 --> 01:05:35.211
So I'm going to come visit you.

01:05:35.213 --> 01:05:36.479
A couple of years
is a very long time.

01:05:36.481 --> 01:05:37.513
No, it's gonna be totally...

01:05:37.515 --> 01:05:39.816
it's not that long.

01:05:39.818 --> 01:05:41.220
Diana, it's not that long.

01:05:44.523 --> 01:05:45.858
Diana, peo... people
do this all the time.

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.195
I... I love you.

01:05:53.631 --> 01:05:54.631
Hey.

01:05:54.633 --> 01:05:55.631
Come on.

01:05:55.633 --> 01:05:57.102
Tell me what's going on.

01:06:02.541 --> 01:06:03.609
We don't To do this.

01:06:06.311 --> 01:06:07.113
Hey.

01:06:10.215 --> 01:06:10.850
It's OK.

01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:18.591
You're just so sure of me,
and it's a lot of pressure.

01:06:21.526 --> 01:06:22.791
I don't...

01:06:22.793 --> 01:06:26.461
I'm not... I'm not
trying to pressure you.

01:06:26.463 --> 01:06:27.398
I just want to be with you.

01:06:39.311 --> 01:06:42.278
Um, I just...

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:43.812
We can totally
figure this out.

01:06:43.814 --> 01:06:46.751
I feel like I need to focus
on myself and my writing.

01:06:49.621 --> 01:06:50.852
- And...
- OK.

01:06:50.854 --> 01:06:51.657
Um...

01:06:56.927 --> 01:06:58.894
I just don't want to hold
you back from anything.

01:06:58.896 --> 01:06:59.963
You're not holding me back.

01:06:59.965 --> 01:07:01.430
And I don't want...

01:07:01.432 --> 01:07:02.832
What would you be
holding me back from?

01:07:02.834 --> 01:07:06.369
I just don't want us to
get trapped in something.

01:07:06.371 --> 01:07:07.570
I don't know what...

01:07:07.572 --> 01:07:08.707
I don't know what
you mean by that.

01:07:19.017 --> 01:07:21.287
I just don't want to
ruin our friendship.

01:07:30.595 --> 01:07:31.561
That's what you...

01:07:31.563 --> 01:07:32.562
that's what you want?

01:07:32.564 --> 01:07:33.365
You want to be friends?

01:07:39.271 --> 01:07:40.639
Ben, I'm breaking
up with you, OK?

01:07:46.711 --> 01:07:47.546
OK?

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:29.850
Thank you.

01:08:29.853 --> 01:08:33.622
Yep, OK, puddle.

01:08:33.625 --> 01:08:34.555
Puddle.

01:08:34.558 --> 01:08:35.890
- Puddle.
- OK.

01:08:35.893 --> 01:08:36.957
- OK.
- Thank you.

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:37.795
Here.

01:08:40.898 --> 01:08:41.767
All right.

01:08:44.536 --> 01:08:45.371
Thanks.

01:08:50.875 --> 01:08:53.408
Do you need anything else?

01:08:53.411 --> 01:08:57.613
Uh, no, I think I'm good.

01:08:57.615 --> 01:09:01.649
Water and meds is perfect.

01:09:01.652 --> 01:09:04.720
OK, good.

01:09:04.723 --> 01:09:06.823
I'm glad you made it.

01:09:06.825 --> 01:09:07.660
Me, too.

01:09:11.830 --> 01:09:14.062
Thanks for helping
me tonight, really.

01:09:14.064 --> 01:09:16.599
Yeah, you're welcome.

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.536
Just being a friend, I guess.

01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:26.975
Sure you're OK?

01:09:26.978 --> 01:09:29.444
Yeah.

01:09:31.415 --> 01:09:32.550
Yeah, I'm good.

01:09:37.488 --> 01:09:41.959
I guess I won't be seeing
you around anymore.

01:09:45.496 --> 01:09:49.798
Well, I wish you luck in all
of your future endeavors.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:51.600
Thank you.

01:09:51.603 --> 01:09:52.702
You, too.

01:09:52.703 --> 01:09:53.770
Why, thank you.

01:09:53.772 --> 01:09:54.573
You're welcome.

01:10:01.612 --> 01:10:06.615
Hey, um, does my head look OK?

01:10:06.617 --> 01:10:09.618
It just... it just
kind of stings.

01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:18.727
Um, I mean, yeah, I don't
want to take the bandage off.

01:10:18.729 --> 01:10:20.631
Yeah, I really think it's OK.

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:32.507
I'm gonna go.

01:10:32.509 --> 01:10:33.111
Yeah, OK.

01:10:39.983 --> 01:10:41.450
Feel better.

01:10:41.452 --> 01:10:42.086
Thank you.

01:10:43.754 --> 01:10:44.686
OK, bye.

01:10:44.688 --> 01:10:45.654
Bye.

01:11:20.191 --> 01:11:21.123
Yeah.

01:11:21.125 --> 01:11:22.691
- Bye.
- Thanks.

01:11:22.693 --> 01:11:23.993
- Yeah, you're welcome.
- Bye.

01:11:23.995 --> 01:11:25.060
- Stay warm.
- OK, bye.

01:11:25.062 --> 01:11:25.863
Bye.

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:38.574
Do you want some tea, too?

01:11:38.576 --> 01:11:39.641
Yes, please.

01:11:39.643 --> 01:11:41.276
Thank you.

01:11:41.278 --> 01:11:43.980
So how are you feeling?

01:11:43.982 --> 01:11:46.916
Good, I'm better, yeah.

01:11:46.918 --> 01:11:48.251
Good.

01:11:48.253 --> 01:11:50.619
Foot's still bothering
me a little bit, but...

01:11:50.621 --> 01:11:52.687
That will take some time.

01:11:52.689 --> 01:11:54.257
I can't believe you
took such a tumble.

01:11:54.259 --> 01:11:56.258
I know.
I know.

01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:58.530
It was, um, stupid.

01:12:02.267 --> 01:12:03.533
I saw our new neighbor.

01:12:03.535 --> 01:12:05.635
Oh, yeah, he's in med school.

01:12:05.637 --> 01:12:07.936
I thought it would be handy
to have an in-house doctor.

01:12:07.938 --> 01:12:09.640
Yes, probably wise.

01:12:12.309 --> 01:12:14.176
So how is your book coming?

01:12:14.178 --> 01:12:21.851
Um, not great.

01:12:21.853 --> 01:12:24.086
Why not?

01:12:24.088 --> 01:12:25.890
I just haven't really
been working on it.

01:12:29.259 --> 01:12:30.560
What's wrong?

01:12:30.562 --> 01:12:32.294
I don't know.

01:12:32.296 --> 01:12:38.536
Um, I don't know what I'm doing.

01:12:41.171 --> 01:12:42.241
Well, what do you
want to be doing?

01:12:46.577 --> 01:12:47.976
I don't know.

01:12:47.978 --> 01:12:50.946
Yes, you do.

01:12:50.948 --> 01:12:53.716
Doll, you're thinking too much.

01:12:53.718 --> 01:12:55.717
Do you want to be writing?

01:12:55.719 --> 01:12:57.153
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:57.155 --> 01:12:58.620
Then don't get comfortable
doing something else.

01:12:58.622 --> 01:13:00.655
Don't settle before
you've even really

01:13:00.657 --> 01:13:01.692
tried to do what you want.

01:13:03.094 --> 01:13:12.237
Yeah, but, uh, what
if it doesn't work out?

01:13:16.808 --> 01:13:18.807
What if I'm not any good?

01:13:18.809 --> 01:13:20.610
I know.

01:13:20.612 --> 01:13:22.645
But you can't not go for what
you really want because you're

01:13:22.647 --> 01:13:24.379
scared of not getting it.

01:13:24.381 --> 01:13:25.347
And listen.

01:13:25.349 --> 01:13:27.083
Things might not work out.

01:13:27.085 --> 01:13:29.084
You might not succeed.

01:13:29.086 --> 01:13:30.386
You might get rejected.

01:13:30.388 --> 01:13:32.622
Those things might
happen, or they might not.

01:13:32.624 --> 01:13:35.658
But they are things
worth knowing.

01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:36.926
I know.

01:13:36.928 --> 01:13:38.394
You're trying to
protect yourself.

01:13:38.396 --> 01:13:40.261
That you're doing it
to a fault, and I don't

01:13:40.263 --> 01:13:41.666
want you to regret not trying.

01:13:45.902 --> 01:13:46.704
Be brave.

01:14:10.027 --> 01:14:11.427
Tea.

01:14:11.429 --> 01:14:12.331
Thank you.

01:14:17.067 --> 01:14:17.869
How's Ben?

01:14:23.775 --> 01:14:29.944
I don't know 'cause he
doesn't live here anymore.

01:14:29.946 --> 01:14:30.881
Oh, sweetie.

01:14:35.719 --> 01:14:36.954
I think I fucked up.

01:14:40.323 --> 01:14:43.092
Do you have anything stronger?

01:14:43.094 --> 01:14:44.025
Yes, I do.

01:14:44.027 --> 01:14:46.361
OK, can we drink that?

01:14:46.363 --> 01:14:47.296
Yes, we can.

01:14:47.298 --> 01:14:48.099
OK.

01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:53.772
Make a plan.

01:15:16.794 --> 01:15:17.793
Hey.

01:15:17.795 --> 01:15:19.194
Hi.

01:15:19.196 --> 01:15:21.230
What are you doing here?

01:15:21.232 --> 01:15:24.365
I... I brought you your sweater
because I'm leaving tomorrow.

01:15:24.367 --> 01:15:25.202
Thanks.

01:15:52.263 --> 01:15:53.261
Bye.

01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:44.579
Oh, hi.

01:16:44.581 --> 01:16:45.483
Oh, thanks.

01:17:03.166 --> 01:17:05.935
...more than I want
to do it, you know?

01:17:05.937 --> 01:17:08.203
- Seriously?
- Oh.

01:17:10.207 --> 01:17:11.041
Ben.

01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:20.983
Hey, Diana, Diana.

01:17:20.985 --> 01:17:23.284
Hey.

01:17:23.286 --> 01:17:24.252
Hey.

01:17:24.254 --> 01:17:25.154
What's up?

01:17:25.156 --> 01:17:26.120
Are you OK?

01:17:26.122 --> 01:17:27.388
Yeah.

01:17:27.390 --> 01:17:29.123
Yeah, Amy gave me your address.

01:17:29.125 --> 01:17:30.426
I hope that's OK.

01:17:30.428 --> 01:17:32.026
Yeah.

01:17:32.028 --> 01:17:34.495
Um, yeah, I didn't know
Meg was gonna be there,

01:17:34.497 --> 01:17:35.098
so I'm sorry.

01:17:39.003 --> 01:17:40.401
Are you guys back together?

01:17:40.403 --> 01:17:41.302
I don't know.

01:17:41.304 --> 01:17:45.274
We're figuring it out.

01:17:45.276 --> 01:17:46.441
Is everything OK?

01:17:46.443 --> 01:17:48.010
Mm-hmm.

01:17:48.012 --> 01:17:50.980
Mm-hmm.

01:17:50.982 --> 01:17:53.449
Mm-hmm.

01:17:53.451 --> 01:17:54.252
Yep.

01:18:02.259 --> 01:18:04.329
Except I'm pretty sure
that I'm in love with you.

01:18:11.335 --> 01:18:12.904
So, um, OK.

01:18:17.107 --> 01:18:19.275
OK, so I know that I hurt you.

01:18:19.277 --> 01:18:24.212
I know... I know that I
hurt you, and I'm so sorry.

01:18:24.214 --> 01:18:27.583
I was scared, and
I was so confused.

01:18:27.585 --> 01:18:33.454
And, um, I thought that
if I ended it, that it

01:18:33.456 --> 01:18:37.493
would be less painful later on.

01:18:37.495 --> 01:18:39.560
But it wasn't.

01:18:39.562 --> 01:18:41.365
And then I moved
back, and I saw you.

01:18:45.469 --> 01:18:47.669
And I just didn't
know what to do.

01:18:47.671 --> 01:18:55.577
So, um, I told myself that I
just wanted to be your friend,

01:18:55.579 --> 01:18:56.481
or that I was just lonely.

01:19:03.521 --> 01:19:08.293
But that's not it because, um,
I think about you all the time.

01:19:11.062 --> 01:19:15.064
I think about you all the time.

01:19:15.066 --> 01:19:22.270
And I... I don't know if,
um, we got back together,

01:19:22.272 --> 01:19:24.974
if we would grow old
together or if we

01:19:24.976 --> 01:19:26.175
would just break up again.

01:19:26.177 --> 01:19:29.610
And it would be
horrible and sad.

01:19:29.612 --> 01:19:41.625
But, um, but I'm in
love with you, Ben.

01:19:53.336 --> 01:19:54.636
This is so unfair.

01:19:54.638 --> 01:19:59.374
I mean, you can't do this now.

01:19:59.376 --> 01:20:00.476
I'm OK, you know?

01:20:00.478 --> 01:20:02.414
And it... it took me a while.

01:20:08.318 --> 01:20:10.351
I just... I just
can't go there again.

01:20:10.353 --> 01:20:11.188
OK.

01:20:18.195 --> 01:20:25.333
Um, don't... don't say no
for the same reason that I

01:20:25.335 --> 01:20:29.139
said no because I was an idiot.

01:20:33.576 --> 01:20:36.779
Just, um, just
please only say no

01:20:36.781 --> 01:20:38.116
if you actually want to say no.

01:20:47.090 --> 01:20:48.360
I'm really sorry.

01:20:51.594 --> 01:20:52.493
I gotta go.

01:20:52.495 --> 01:20:53.330
OK.

01:22:49.245 --> 01:22:53.614
Uh, yeah, I was just making
sure that you got my samples.

01:22:53.616 --> 01:22:57.185
Oh, OK, great, um,
yes, that's it.

01:22:57.187 --> 01:22:57.919
Thank you.

01:22:57.921 --> 01:22:58.723
Thank you so much.

01:23:18.608 --> 01:23:20.208
Oh, yeah.

01:23:20.210 --> 01:23:23.645
Mm, hey.

01:23:23.647 --> 01:23:24.680
I got you hot chocolate.

01:23:24.682 --> 01:23:26.648
Aw, thanks, baby.

01:23:26.650 --> 01:23:28.417
You're welcome.

01:23:28.419 --> 01:23:30.351
Hey, I've been thinking about
starting to go by Gabrielle.

01:23:30.353 --> 01:23:32.287
What do you think?

01:23:32.289 --> 01:23:34.455
Um, no.

01:23:34.457 --> 01:23:35.556
Why?

01:23:35.558 --> 01:23:36.824
I don't know.

01:23:36.826 --> 01:23:38.526
I feel like it sounds
more professional.

01:23:38.528 --> 01:23:40.995
Mm, no, I like Gabby.

01:23:40.997 --> 01:23:43.966
I also think I'm going
to stop wearing bras.

01:23:43.968 --> 01:23:46.534
Right, because it's
not professional?

01:23:46.536 --> 01:23:48.971
No, but apparently
it's good for your boobs.

01:23:48.973 --> 01:23:52.341
Like, I read this article about
how wearing bras all the time

01:23:52.343 --> 01:23:56.444
can make your boobs sag
earlier because the tissue

01:23:56.446 --> 01:23:58.579
and the ligaments...

01:23:58.581 --> 01:24:00.414
or maybe it's the muscles...

01:24:00.416 --> 01:24:02.450
anyway, they become
lazy or something.

01:24:02.452 --> 01:24:03.918
Seriously?

01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:06.954
Yeah, I'm getting the details
mixed up, but it's true.

01:24:06.956 --> 01:24:08.856
I thought it was that,
like, the underwire

01:24:08.858 --> 01:24:11.693
actually helps to sort of remind
them to, like, sit up straight.

01:24:11.695 --> 01:24:12.660
You know, that they're like...

01:24:12.662 --> 01:24:13.964
Uh, D, Ben's here.

01:24:17.768 --> 01:24:19.668
I'm gonna go.

01:24:19.670 --> 01:24:21.369
Um, just go say hi.

01:24:21.371 --> 01:24:23.374
And... and don't be weird, OK?

01:24:27.443 --> 01:24:28.745
OK, just call me later.

01:24:47.397 --> 01:24:48.297
Hey.

01:24:48.299 --> 01:24:50.699
Hey.

01:24:50.701 --> 01:24:53.534
What are you doing here?

01:24:53.536 --> 01:24:56.340
I was just, uh, picking up
some mail that Amy had for me.

01:25:02.379 --> 01:25:06.584
It's actually, uh,
warrants for my arrest.

01:25:09.652 --> 01:25:11.986
Oh.

01:25:11.988 --> 01:25:17.592
Parking tickets, I guess
I just forgot about them.

01:25:17.594 --> 01:25:20.561
I mean, you had so
many parking tickets.

01:25:20.563 --> 01:25:21.398
I don't even own a car.

01:25:25.501 --> 01:25:28.002
Well, there's always Mexico.

01:25:28.004 --> 01:25:31.840
Yeah, yeah, no, Mexico is
not something I considered.

01:25:31.842 --> 01:25:33.911
But now I'll probably do that.

01:25:36.879 --> 01:25:42.383
Um, what are you
actually doing right now?

01:25:42.385 --> 01:25:48.590
Um, I have to pick
up my dry cleaning, uh,

01:25:48.592 --> 01:25:49.958
before they close.

01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:50.891
Oh, OK.

01:25:50.893 --> 01:25:51.793
Yeah.

01:25:51.795 --> 01:25:52.993
Sure.

01:25:52.995 --> 01:25:58.035
Yeah, um, maybe
do you want to come?

01:26:03.139 --> 01:26:03.974
Yeah.

01:26:06.710 --> 01:26:07.545
Yeah.
