00:01.990 --> 00:04.540
>> Julie: Tonight, one
houseguest says good-bye and the

00:04.540 --> 00:08.990
twins say hello as they both
enter the the game.

00:08.990 --> 00:13.700
Plus an epic battle of endurance
will determine the first solo

00:13.700 --> 00:15.990
head of household of the summer.

00:15.990 --> 00:21.120
Welcome to "Big Brother."

00:21.120 --> 00:25.990
( Cheers )
>> Previously on "Big Brother,"

00:25.990 --> 00:29.990
after learning that Austin told
Jason about the twins--

00:29.990 --> 00:33.990
>> he told Jason if people
target him he wants Liz to be

00:33.990 --> 00:36.990
saved so that he and Liz can go
to jury together.

00:36.990 --> 00:38.990
>> Austin what, are you doing!

00:38.990 --> 00:45.990
>> Vanessa, Clay, and Shelli
were ready to blow up the

00:45.990 --> 00:48.990
6th sense alliance.

00:48.990 --> 00:50.990
>> Is this possible we're going
to blow up our alliance.

00:50.990 --> 00:53.990
>> The plan was to backdoor
Austin.

00:53.990 --> 00:54.990
>> You lie to me and get caught.

00:54.990 --> 00:55.990
>> It's over.

00:55.990 --> 00:56.990
>> I don't trust him.

00:56.990 --> 00:57.990
He's not working with me.

00:57.990 --> 00:58.540
That's it.

00:58.540 --> 01:01.990
>> Vanessa got the other side of
the house on board.

01:01.990 --> 01:05.990
>> With the eight of us we get
those three out and go from

01:05.990 --> 01:06.990
there.

01:06.990 --> 01:11.830
>> And formed a new alliance
with them.

01:11.830 --> 01:16.990
>>
>> after Clay won the veto--

01:16.990 --> 01:20.120
>> you know, I really can't tell
you how happy I am to have this

01:20.120 --> 01:21.990
little guy around my neck.

01:21.990 --> 01:24.950
>> Liz learned Austin was the
target.

01:24.950 --> 01:26.990
>> He created a giant target for
himself.

01:26.990 --> 01:28.990
He also made a huge target out
of you.

01:28.990 --> 01:31.990
>> But she convinced Vanessa to
hear him out.

01:31.990 --> 01:34.990
>> If he goes out, we're down an
alliance member.

01:34.990 --> 01:36.990
>> This is a problem, he is a
vote.

01:36.990 --> 01:37.990
>> He is a vote on our side.

01:37.990 --> 01:39.990
>> Learning his game was in
jeopardy--

01:39.990 --> 01:40.990
>> are you going to put me up?

01:40.990 --> 01:42.990
>> It's a real possibility.

01:42.990 --> 01:44.950
>> Oh, my God, Vanessa, please.

01:44.950 --> 01:45.990
>> Austin begged for his life.

01:45.990 --> 01:48.990
>> I will do anything, anything,
anything.

01:48.990 --> 01:50.990
>> Just go figure it out with
Shelli and Clay.

01:50.990 --> 01:56.990
If can figure it out with them,
obviously I'll listen.

01:56.990 --> 01:58.990
>> I'm never going to go against
you guys.

01:58.990 --> 01:59.990
I'm not going to.

01:59.990 --> 02:00.990
>> We need that number.

02:00.990 --> 02:03.540
It is not in our best interest
that you go home.

02:03.540 --> 02:06.410
>> Vanessa neededda I new
backdoor plan.

02:06.410 --> 02:10.410
>> Jason is the smarter one.

02:10.410 --> 02:11.990
Getting rid of him is smart.

02:11.990 --> 02:12.990
>> At the veto meeting.

02:12.990 --> 02:15.990
>> I have decide to use the
power of veto to save myself.

02:15.990 --> 02:20.120
>> Half of the house was
blindsided.

02:20.120 --> 02:20.990
>> Jason, take a seat.

02:20.990 --> 02:26.990
>> Tonight, will Becky's game be
permanently derailed or will the

02:26.990 --> 02:28.990
supermarket cashier check out of
the house?

02:28.990 --> 02:30.990
Plus, both twins enter the game.

02:30.990 --> 02:36.990
All this live right now on "big
brother."

02:36.990 --> 02:38.990
>> Run, you crazy squirrels!

03:17.000 --> 03:20.120
( Cheers and applause )
>> Julie: Good evening.

03:20.120 --> 03:20.990
I'm Julie chen.

03:20.990 --> 03:22.700
Welcome to "Big Brother."

03:22.700 --> 03:27.990
It was the biggest surprise of
the summer as Vanessa decided to

03:27.990 --> 03:32.990
keep the 6th sense alliance
intact by sparing Austin,

03:32.990 --> 03:35.990
blindsiding Jason, and in doing
so, crushing the other side of

03:35.990 --> 03:38.990
the house.

03:38.990 --> 03:43.830
Now Jason sids side by side on
the block with Becky.

03:43.830 --> 03:45.990
Whose game will come to an end
tonight?

03:45.990 --> 03:46.990
We'll soon find out.

03:46.990 --> 03:50.990
But first, he was shocked when
Vanessa called his name and put

03:50.990 --> 03:52.990
him on the block.

03:52.990 --> 04:05.990
But Jason wasn't the only one
blindsided.

04:05.990 --> 04:09.990
>> I didn't want to blindside
you, but I had no choice.

04:09.990 --> 04:10.990
>> That's okay.

04:10.990 --> 04:12.990
I don't understand what it's
about.

04:12.990 --> 04:13.990
>> It's not way I wanted to do
it.

04:13.990 --> 04:14.990
>> Okay.

04:14.990 --> 04:15.990
>> But I didn't have a choice.

04:15.990 --> 04:20.990
>> Apparently this dark moon
alliance is a big bag of

04:20.990 --> 04:20.990
bullcrap.

04:20.990 --> 04:22.990
Say what it is or take your butt
upstairs.

04:22.990 --> 04:27.990
I don't need to hear some stupid
apology that is as shallow as a

04:27.990 --> 04:27.990
puddle.

04:27.990 --> 04:28.990
>> Sorry, buddy.

04:28.990 --> 04:32.990
>> That's okay.

04:32.990 --> 04:35.120
>> I feel like a total idiot
right now.

04:35.120 --> 04:37.990
I've been working with Vanessa
this entire week, and I've been

04:37.990 --> 04:41.990
really close with her, and then
she pulls a fast one on the rest

04:41.990 --> 04:42.990
of us.

04:42.990 --> 04:44.990
Vanessa, Austin was supposed to
be the replacement nominee, and

04:44.990 --> 04:47.990
you had a group of eight backing
you.

04:47.990 --> 04:49.990
I don't know why you would do
this right now.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.990
>> Don't cry, Meg.

04:52.990 --> 04:59.000
>> I couldn't be more
blindsided, angry, upset.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.990
I feel lied to in the house.

05:00.990 --> 05:03.990
I don't know who knew about
this.

05:03.990 --> 05:05.990
Oh, God!

05:05.990 --> 05:09.990
>> Jason is on the block, and
there's a lot of emotions.

05:09.990 --> 05:13.000
I'm going to lay low and just
hope they get all the votes come

05:13.000 --> 05:14.990
Thursday.

05:14.990 --> 05:17.990
>> What can you do now?

05:17.990 --> 05:20.990
In this house, it's hard holding
emotions in.

05:20.990 --> 05:22.990
This is my life.

05:22.990 --> 05:26.950
So for me, it means a lot more
than it means to these other

05:26.950 --> 05:33.950
people.

05:33.950 --> 05:36.990
I may be blindsided, but there
is no way that I am just going

05:36.990 --> 05:37.990
to roll over and die.

05:37.990 --> 05:41.990
I am definitely fighting this
week as hard as I can.

05:41.990 --> 05:45.990
Because that's what a real
superfan does.

05:45.990 --> 05:46.950
>> You all right?

05:46.950 --> 05:49.990
>> Yeah, I'm fine.

05:49.990 --> 05:51.990
>> Was this the plan the whole
time?

05:51.990 --> 05:53.990
>> Maybe.

05:53.990 --> 05:55.990
>> So we were all played?

05:55.990 --> 05:56.990
>> I was at least.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.410
I don't know about you guys.

05:58.410 --> 06:02.990
Who knows --
>> I was because I wasn't a part

06:02.990 --> 06:02.990
of this.

06:02.990 --> 06:03.990
I have no idea.

06:03.990 --> 06:07.990
>> Everybody is pretty upset,
but guess who's not upset?

06:07.990 --> 06:09.990
Clay and Shelli.

06:09.990 --> 06:13.990
And that's when it dawns on me,
Shelly and Clay have been behind

06:13.990 --> 06:22.990
every eviction, and why would
that be any different this week?

06:22.990 --> 06:25.990
>> That alliance worked very
well, lasted very long.

06:25.990 --> 06:26.990
>> Uh-huh.

06:26.990 --> 06:28.990
>> It was great.

06:28.990 --> 06:37.990
>> Shout out, dark moon.

06:37.990 --> 06:40.950
>> Were you nervous when she was
doing that speech?

06:40.950 --> 06:42.540
>> No.

06:42.540 --> 06:44.990
>> Meg, did you see her face?

06:44.990 --> 06:46.990
So good.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.990
I was nervous.

06:48.990 --> 06:51.990
One more for the good guys.

06:51.990 --> 06:54.990
Oh, my God, my dreams just came
true.

06:54.990 --> 06:56.990
Somehow I've been given a second
chance in this game.

06:56.990 --> 06:58.540
It was a blindside.

06:58.540 --> 06:58.990
It was beautiful.

06:58.990 --> 07:02.990
And now that I'm safe, the
6th sense is coming to

07:02.990 --> 07:02.990
fruition.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.410
We are killing it.

07:04.410 --> 07:07.950
We're the power, and I'm going
to go far in this game.

07:07.950 --> 07:10.990
♪ ♪ ♪
>> it's like our game game now.

07:10.990 --> 07:12.990
They have no chance.

07:22.990 --> 07:25.000
>> You're telling me you knew,
right?

07:25.000 --> 07:25.990
>> Yes.

07:25.990 --> 07:29.410
>> I wouldn't hold it against
you if you knew.

07:29.410 --> 07:29.990
I'm dead serious.

07:29.990 --> 07:30.990
>> No, no, I know.

07:30.990 --> 07:31.990
I know.

07:31.990 --> 07:35.950
>> Both fg you seriously did not
know?

07:35.950 --> 07:36.990
>>, of course, I knew about the
plan.

07:36.990 --> 07:40.990
However, I'm stuck between a
hard place right now between Meg

07:40.990 --> 07:41.000
and Vanessa.

07:41.000 --> 07:46.990
I don't know what to say without
exposing everything that's going

07:46.990 --> 07:47.410
on.

07:47.410 --> 07:48.990
Austin I think made a deal with
her.

07:48.990 --> 07:53.950
>> So why did she take that deal
as opposed to keeping up an

07:53.950 --> 07:56.990
alliance that she created?

07:56.990 --> 07:57.990
>> Which one?

07:57.990 --> 08:02.990
>> Like, all of us, the eight
people, the final eight.

08:02.990 --> 08:08.990
I'm sure if she made some deal,
she told Austin everything.

08:08.990 --> 08:09.990
>> Who?

08:09.990 --> 08:13.700
>> Vanessa, told Austin
everything.

08:13.700 --> 08:16.290
She doesn't look like she's
doing much damage control.

08:16.290 --> 08:18.990
>> That is true.

08:18.990 --> 08:25.990
I didn't think about that.

08:25.990 --> 08:27.990
>> You swear you did not know.

08:27.990 --> 08:29.990
>> Austin was the plan as far as
I knew.

08:29.990 --> 08:33.120
>> I feel horrible about being
lied to and being kept in the

08:33.120 --> 08:33.990
dark about Jason.

08:33.990 --> 08:38.950
If these people can create a
fake dark moon alliance, then

08:38.950 --> 08:40.990
the least they can do is tell me
what is going on.

08:40.990 --> 08:51.990
I need to get answers.

08:51.990 --> 08:52.990
>> Come in.

08:52.990 --> 08:53.990
>> Hey.

08:53.990 --> 08:54.990
>> Hey.

08:54.990 --> 08:57.950
>> I'm trying really hard not to
be personal, okay.

08:57.950 --> 08:58.990
Just bear withy me.

08:58.990 --> 08:59.950
>> Okay.

08:59.950 --> 09:01.990
>> I'm just-- sorry.

09:01.990 --> 09:07.830
I'm, like, so hurt today.

09:07.830 --> 09:10.990
I was so excited to work with
you, Vanessa, and now I feel

09:10.990 --> 09:12.120
like a very dumb girl.

09:12.120 --> 09:15.950
>> What happened was, what went
down, went down and I

09:15.950 --> 09:16.990
accidentally remained in power.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.990
People took advantage of that to
make the move they really wanted

09:18.990 --> 09:19.990
to do.

09:19.990 --> 09:21.990
>> Did they know about this
before?

09:21.990 --> 09:22.990
>> Obviously.

09:22.990 --> 09:24.290
Shelly and Clay must feel
threatened.

09:24.290 --> 09:24.990
>> Right.

09:24.990 --> 09:25.990
>> For some reason.

09:25.990 --> 09:27.990
If you think I would do this by
myself--

09:27.990 --> 09:28.990
>> I know, I know.

09:28.990 --> 09:31.950
>> What a dumb-ass move that
would be.

09:31.950 --> 09:33.990
If they pretend they didn't know
that is going to piss me off

09:33.990 --> 09:36.990
because that is not cool to me.

09:36.990 --> 09:41.990
They know I was the one in the
line of fire and I wouldn't have

09:41.990 --> 09:45.290
done it if everybody didn't want
it.

09:45.290 --> 09:47.830
>> Which nobody admits.

09:47.830 --> 09:49.000
>> They are lying.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.990
Flat-out lying to you.

09:50.990 --> 09:57.990
That's good for me to know.

09:57.990 --> 09:58.990
>> Hey.

09:58.990 --> 10:02.990
>> Hey, guys.

10:02.990 --> 10:03.830
What happened?

10:03.830 --> 10:04.990
Can you tell now?

10:04.990 --> 10:08.990
Because I'm, like, lost in the
wilderness.

10:08.990 --> 10:12.990
>> Okay, so it comes down to can
I trust Austin more?

10:12.990 --> 10:15.990
And can I trust Jason more?

10:15.990 --> 10:18.950
Really, I only have to go with
my gut.

10:18.950 --> 10:21.990
>> I 100% back up Vanessa's
decision.

10:21.990 --> 10:22.990
You know my twin thing.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.000
Jason was one of the first
people to find out and instead

10:25.000 --> 10:28.290
of being smart, keeping it to
himself, he told the whole

10:28.290 --> 10:30.990
house, and it kind of boils my
blood.

10:30.990 --> 10:32.990
So that's where I'm at.

10:32.990 --> 10:36.990
>> And on top of that, the
majority of people in the house

10:36.990 --> 10:37.540
agree with me.

10:37.540 --> 10:39.120
>> That Jason should go?

10:39.120 --> 10:42.990
>> That Jason should go.

10:42.990 --> 10:43.990
A big majority.

10:43.990 --> 10:45.990
>> Are you in that majority?

10:45.990 --> 10:48.290
>> I don't want Jason to go.

10:48.290 --> 10:50.990
But you--
>> you didn't want Jason to go?

10:50.990 --> 10:52.990
>> I don't want to see Jason out
of this house

10:52.990 --> 10:56.000
I don't want to see anybody out
of this house.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
When somebody comes to me and
says, "do you want Jason to go?"

10:58.000 --> 10:58.990
No, I don't Jason to go.

10:58.990 --> 11:01.540
>> Are you behind the decision I
made?

11:01.540 --> 11:05.990
>> I didn't ask you-- if you
were one of those people.

11:05.990 --> 11:06.990
>> It's devastating.

11:06.990 --> 11:10.990
>> When I called Shelli out and
she start freaking out I know

11:10.990 --> 11:15.540
100% Shelli was on board with
this, and that's shady as hell

11:15.540 --> 11:17.990
and that, wasn't, like the plan,
and that's why.

11:17.990 --> 11:19.990
>> Everybody wanted that done.

11:19.990 --> 11:22.990
When presented with the option,
that's what everyone preferred.

11:22.990 --> 11:25.410
I was stuck between a rock and a
hard place and I just did the

11:25.410 --> 11:38.990
best I could.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.990
>> Clay lied to my face.

11:40.990 --> 11:42.990
I'm over being upset about it.

11:42.990 --> 11:45.990
I'm livid.

11:45.990 --> 11:51.540
Clay, Shelli, Vanessa, Austin.

11:51.540 --> 11:53.990
>> They're all working together,
aren't they?

11:53.990 --> 11:55.410
>> Now.

11:55.410 --> 11:58.990
>> Do you think it's weird that
certain-- there's been a couple

11:58.990 --> 12:03.990
of people that have had a hand
in every single eviction?

12:03.990 --> 12:09.990
>> Clay and Shelli, yeah.

12:09.990 --> 12:10.990
>> You okay, honey?

12:10.990 --> 12:11.000
>> Yeah.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.700
>> What's going on?

12:12.700 --> 12:14.540
>> Oh, I'm livid.

12:14.540 --> 12:14.990
It's the house.

12:14.990 --> 12:17.410
>> Shelli and Clay, too.

12:17.410 --> 12:17.990
>> Yeah.

12:17.990 --> 12:20.990
I actually think that's who--
>> started it.

12:20.990 --> 12:21.990
>> You okay?

12:21.990 --> 12:24.990
>> Come in here.

12:24.990 --> 12:30.990
>> Jackie's in a tough spot.

12:30.990 --> 12:31.990
>> You've got my vote.

12:31.990 --> 12:35.540
I promise you that.

12:35.540 --> 12:46.950
>> You're going to get me going.

12:46.950 --> 12:51.000
>> I feel like, I, like, let you
down, Jason.

12:51.000 --> 12:51.990
I tried so hard.

12:51.990 --> 12:55.000
I don't know how this happened.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.990
We're all so stupid.

12:57.990 --> 12:58.990
>> Pull it together.

12:58.990 --> 13:00.290
Pull it together, guys.

13:00.290 --> 13:08.990
>> Why do they keep putting up
my peeps?

13:08.990 --> 13:20.000
Stop putting up my people.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.990
>> If Shelly and Clay are trying
to deny the fact they knew Jason

13:22.990 --> 13:25.990
was going to be the replacement
nominee, that put a huge target

13:25.990 --> 13:29.990
on my back and it also ignights
a little spark of doubt in my

13:29.990 --> 13:32.990
mind whether or not I can fully
trust them.

13:32.990 --> 13:36.990
All we can do is make the best
move we can make with the

13:36.990 --> 13:37.990
information we have.

13:37.990 --> 13:38.540
Hey.

13:38.540 --> 13:42.990
>> Honestly, I'm realizing that
this thing happening, like

13:42.990 --> 13:46.990
people coming and asking you and
you're able to give people

13:46.990 --> 13:48.540
extremely compelling arguments
and reasons.

13:48.540 --> 13:51.990
>> I was like if you think I
would do this move by myself.

13:51.990 --> 13:53.000
You must think I'm nuts.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.990
I wouldn't do this by myself.

13:54.990 --> 13:57.990
>> You're telling everyone the
whole house on board and the

13:57.990 --> 14:00.290
only people they're asking about
because the only people they're

14:00.290 --> 14:02.990
suspecting you would have talked
to is the two of us.

14:02.990 --> 14:05.540
>> I recognized that was a risk
and you guys need to recognize

14:05.540 --> 14:07.990
that was a risk we took in this
move.

14:07.990 --> 14:09.990
I drew a line in the sand--
>> this is the thing I'm

14:09.990 --> 14:10.990
concerned about right now.

14:10.990 --> 14:13.990
The only people who now have a
target for having been in on

14:13.990 --> 14:15.990
this and not saying anything is
us.

14:15.990 --> 14:17.990
>> I'm lumped into that, just so
know.

14:17.990 --> 14:18.990
>> Not really.

14:18.990 --> 14:20.990
People are now going to come for
us before you.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.990
>> I guarantee you, I'm the
first to go on the block.

14:22.990 --> 14:23.990
It's a fact.

14:23.990 --> 14:26.990
Like if you think that that's
not possible you must think
that,

14:26.990 --> 14:27.990
like, I have magical powers.

14:27.990 --> 14:31.990
>> The fact of the matter is,
this is not a good look for me

14:31.990 --> 14:32.950
and Clay.

14:32.950 --> 14:34.990
We have done a really good job
of building some relationships

14:34.990 --> 14:35.990
on the other sight of house.

14:35.990 --> 14:40.990
And this could really harm us
more than it could harm Vanessa.

14:40.990 --> 14:43.990
I just wish we had a game plan
of what we should say because

14:43.990 --> 14:45.990
then you would have been saying
the same thing when people asked

14:45.990 --> 14:46.990
that question.

14:46.990 --> 14:55.990
It was so terribly awkward, I
wanted to die.

14:55.990 --> 14:59.410
>> Julie: Coming up, it's the
live vote and eviction.

14:59.410 --> 15:03.990
Becky or Jason, who will be the
next houseguest to leave the

15:03.990 --> 15:04.540
game?

15:04.540 --> 15:08.990
Plus, Liz and Julia have
survived five evictions, which

15:08.990 --> 15:12.990
means they will now enter the
game and play as individual

15:12.990 --> 15:13.990
houseguests.

15:13.990 --> 15:19.990
The twins are officially
revealed to the others live
tonight.

15:19.990 --> 15:21.990
And Big Brother wants to hear
from you.

15:21.990 --> 15:26.990
Send us your videos using
#bbsoundoff to tell us which

15:26.990 --> 15:30.990
houseguest you're rooting for
and why.

15:30.990 --> 15:33.990
Go to CBS.Com/bbsoundoff to
learn more.

15:33.990 --> 15:35.990
Stay with us.

16:05.990 --> 16:07.540
>> Julie: Welcome back to "big
brother."

16:07.540 --> 16:12.990
Upset and betrayed, Jason and
his allies know who stabbed him

16:12.990 --> 16:16.990
in the back, but can they use
this information to turn his

16:16.990 --> 16:25.990
fate around?

16:25.990 --> 16:29.990
>> I just thought of the
craziest idea in the world.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.990
>> Which is?

16:31.990 --> 16:36.290
>> In all reality, you played a
better game than Becky, so I

16:36.290 --> 16:37.990
would like for you to stay.

16:37.990 --> 16:38.830
>> Okay.

16:38.830 --> 16:39.990
>> How do we get the numbers?

16:39.990 --> 16:41.990
>> We've got three and we need
two more.

16:41.990 --> 16:42.990
>> Who else is there?

16:42.990 --> 16:53.990
>> Steve, Johnny Mac, Liz and
Austin or clellie.

16:53.990 --> 16:56.290
Those are the three pairs upon
those are the six.

16:56.290 --> 16:58.290
>> How do we convince them?

16:58.290 --> 17:01.540
>> Should we go crazy and look
for Austin and Liz?

17:01.540 --> 17:01.990
They're stupid.

17:01.990 --> 17:03.700
They need numbers, too.

17:03.700 --> 17:04.990
>> Liz hates him.

17:04.990 --> 17:07.990
>> Yeah, that would be super
hard to flip.

17:07.990 --> 17:10.990
>> Because Shelly and Clay will
not, I feel, because they're the

17:10.990 --> 17:14.000
ones who did this, and they know
that.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.830
>> But they're so wishy-washy
and they're so paranoid, that if

17:17.830 --> 17:20.990
you scare them enough--
>> the dog goes back to their

17:20.990 --> 17:21.290
( bleep ) House.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.990
>> Exactly.

17:22.990 --> 17:26.990
If we can scare Shelly and Clay
and let them know the house will

17:26.990 --> 17:30.000
come after them next we, I will
keep them safe next week.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.830
We need to convince them that
Becky will go after them.

17:32.830 --> 17:33.290
>> It makes sense.

17:33.290 --> 17:34.410
>> This is all I have.

17:34.410 --> 17:43.290
I will not lose.

17:43.290 --> 17:45.540
>> I know you're tired.

17:45.540 --> 17:46.990
I'm doing my one last round.

17:46.990 --> 17:47.990
>> Oh, get in here.

17:47.990 --> 17:52.990
>> I know that if game makes us
all, like, really paranoid, and

17:52.990 --> 17:53.990
I've been paranoid.

17:53.990 --> 17:59.990
But I am good with, like, my
loyalty.

17:59.990 --> 18:00.990
So--
>> you can come in.

18:00.990 --> 18:03.990
>> Yeah, yeah.

18:03.990 --> 18:07.830
>> The first part moof I plan,
make Shelli and Clay paranoid.

18:07.830 --> 18:09.990
Which, honestly, should not be
that hard.

18:09.990 --> 18:13.990
I am going to sell them the
biggest plate of bull that I

18:13.990 --> 18:14.990
have.

18:14.990 --> 18:18.410
What it really comes down to is
I can be more loyal to you guys

18:18.410 --> 18:21.990
than Becky could ever be.

18:21.990 --> 18:24.990
Becky told me that next week
she's going to put you two up

18:24.990 --> 18:25.990
against each other.

18:25.990 --> 18:27.000
>> Did she really say that?

18:27.000 --> 18:30.990
>> I swear, I swear on
everything.

18:30.990 --> 18:31.990
Everything.

18:31.990 --> 18:34.990
Part two, I will sell my soul
and my firstborn child over to

18:34.990 --> 18:39.410
those two.

18:39.410 --> 18:41.990
I'll give you all whatever the
hell you want.

18:41.990 --> 18:44.990
Literally, and me and Meg would
be so down for the final four.

18:44.990 --> 18:48.000
>> You can't be in an alliance
with people that you don't trust

18:48.000 --> 18:48.990
fully.

18:48.990 --> 18:49.540
>> Of course,.

18:49.540 --> 18:52.990
>> If we vote to keep you, we're
playing our cards.

18:52.990 --> 18:55.830
That's going to piss off Liz and
Austin for sure.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.990
>> If you save me, you're the
top of my totem pole.

18:57.990 --> 19:02.410
You're the top of Meg's totem
pole.

19:02.410 --> 19:04.990
Jackie will be grateful for you.

19:04.990 --> 19:08.990
James will be grateful for you
and you're in a much spot than

19:08.990 --> 19:12.990
being on the tail end of Austin
and Liz's, whatever they've

19:12.990 --> 19:13.540
created.

19:13.540 --> 19:15.990
They're going to be a
three-headed monster, and

19:15.990 --> 19:17.990
everyone is going to realize
that.

19:17.990 --> 19:18.990
>> The biggest target in the
house right there.

19:18.990 --> 19:19.990
>> Exactly.

19:19.990 --> 19:22.990
I will be so eternally greatful
to you guys.

19:22.990 --> 19:24.990
I am full of anxiety.

19:24.990 --> 19:27.990
I've had to fight every week
I've been in this house, but I

19:27.990 --> 19:31.990
vanever had to fight this hard,
and this is really my last

19:31.990 --> 19:31.990
stand.

19:31.990 --> 19:38.990
I will follow you to the pits of
hell if you leave this bitch

19:38.990 --> 19:41.000
here for one more week.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.990
>> Julie: Tonight, Becky and
Jason sit anxiously on the

19:44.990 --> 19:45.830
block.

19:45.830 --> 19:47.990
It's a place all too familiar
with Johnny Mac.

19:47.990 --> 19:50.990
And while he's never been a
target, are the others making a

19:50.990 --> 19:57.990
mistake letting this rock 'n'
roll dentist slide by?

19:57.990 --> 20:00.990
>> I'm eating so much candy for
a tentist.

20:00.990 --> 20:04.000
>> I have 15 more years, 20 more
years, maybe omy teeth.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.990
>> Dude it's not an age thing.

20:05.990 --> 20:14.990
If you take good care of them,
you'll die with those.

20:14.990 --> 20:17.990
>> John here is like a
different-- different person

20:17.990 --> 20:18.990
than he is on the game.

20:18.990 --> 20:21.990
>> He's playing so dumb, it's
amusing.

20:21.990 --> 20:25.990
>> He's mastered game and he
knows exactly what he's doing.

20:25.990 --> 20:29.990
My name is Maria and I work with
Dr. John Maguire.

20:29.990 --> 20:31.990
Dr. Maguire is very professional
at work.

20:31.990 --> 20:36.120
>> Stress the sexiness of
flossing.

20:36.120 --> 20:39.120
( Applause )
>> Get that flack, get it

20:39.120 --> 20:41.990
out of there!

20:41.990 --> 20:43.990
>> We're definitely seeing a
different side of him on the

20:43.990 --> 20:45.990
show air, a different side of
him.

20:45.990 --> 20:47.990
>> Come he were, kitty.

20:47.990 --> 20:50.990
>> One, two, three!

20:50.990 --> 20:51.290
( Cheers and applause ).

20:51.290 --> 20:53.990
>> He's very good with the
patients.

20:53.990 --> 20:56.990
He's very-- like, he makes them
feel really comfortable.

20:56.990 --> 21:00.990
>> You probably just scraped it
on something.

21:00.990 --> 21:03.990
>> His patients miss him.

21:03.990 --> 21:08.290
>> My name is George I'm a
patient of Dr. Maguire's.

21:08.290 --> 21:11.990
I absolutely trust Johnny Mac
when he has the drill in his

21:11.990 --> 21:12.990
hand.

21:12.990 --> 21:16.990
>> First year in dental school I
cut a cadaver head in half.

21:16.990 --> 21:19.950
>> Why did you do that for
dental school?

21:19.950 --> 21:23.120
>> I've done some crazy stuff.

21:23.120 --> 21:28.410
>> For a bass player, you'd
think he'd have a little more

21:28.410 --> 21:28.990
rhythm.

21:28.990 --> 21:30.990
My name is Frank.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.410
I'm John's father.

21:32.410 --> 21:34.990
John was always a fun-loving
kid, did anything he set his

21:34.990 --> 21:35.990
mind to.

21:35.990 --> 21:38.990
I nearly fell on the floor the
day he said he was going to

21:38.990 --> 21:43.990
dental school because health
class made him sick to his

21:43.990 --> 21:44.000
stomach.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.990
>> Have you ever tried shelters
before?

21:46.990 --> 21:48.990
One, two, three, four.

21:48.990 --> 21:49.990
É
( Cheers )

21:49.990 --> 21:52.990
>> I'm Jordan, my older brother
is John.

21:52.990 --> 21:56.990
Johnny Mac seems like a really
well-liked person, but he's

21:56.990 --> 21:59.990
still not becoming a threat.

21:59.990 --> 22:03.990
What his strategy was, get
everyone to like him, and one by

22:03.990 --> 22:06.990
one stab them in the back and
take over the entire house.

22:06.990 --> 22:09.830
>> I couldn't believe when they
were trying to get him to not

22:09.830 --> 22:10.990
use want veto on himself.

22:10.990 --> 22:14.830
>> We need to talk to you about
not using the power of veto.

22:14.830 --> 22:15.990
>> No!

22:15.990 --> 22:19.540
>> Johnny Mac is still in enigma
in that house.

22:19.540 --> 22:22.830
Nobody really knows the real
Johnny Mac and I think that's a

22:22.830 --> 22:25.990
huge benefit for him down the
way.

22:25.990 --> 22:29.990
>> Julie: Coming up, Becky or
Jason?

22:29.990 --> 22:32.990
Who will be the next houseguest
sent packing?

22:32.990 --> 22:36.990
And then Julia find out for the
first time she's made it into

22:36.990 --> 22:37.990
the game.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.990
Stay with us.

22:57.700 --> 22:59.950
>> Julie: Welcome back to "big
brother."

22:59.950 --> 23:00.990
Becky or Jason.

23:00.990 --> 23:04.700
One of their stays in the "big
brother" house is about to come
to an end.

23:04.700 --> 23:07.990
Let's go to the living room for
a live vote and eviction.

23:07.990 --> 23:09.990
Hello, houseguests.

23:09.990 --> 23:11.990
>> Hi, Julie!

23:11.990 --> 23:14.990
>> Julie: Well, everyone, it's
now time for the live vote to
begin.

23:14.990 --> 23:18.990
Becky, Jason, in just moments
your housemates will cast their

23:18.990 --> 23:19.990
votes to evict live.

23:19.990 --> 23:23.990
Before they do, you each have a
final chance to sway their votes

23:23.990 --> 23:27.990
with one brief statement.

23:27.990 --> 23:27.990
Becky you're first.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.990
>> Thank you, Julie.

23:29.990 --> 23:33.830
All right, so first off to
everyone back in Colorado,

23:33.830 --> 23:35.990
friends, family, and your
support is everything.

23:35.990 --> 23:38.990
Houseguests, we have so many
strong players in this room.

23:38.990 --> 23:39.830
We get ugly.

23:39.830 --> 23:40.990
We can get intense.

23:40.990 --> 23:44.120
But behind each one of us are
genuine, kind people and that's

23:44.120 --> 23:45.990
what makes this game so much fun
right now.

23:45.990 --> 23:48.990
And I will say, Jason, it is so
hard being on the block next to

23:48.990 --> 23:49.990
you.

23:49.990 --> 23:50.990
We're very different.

23:50.990 --> 23:51.830
You're wild.

23:51.830 --> 23:52.000
I'm basic.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.990
( Laughter )
But over the last couple of

23:54.990 --> 23:56.990
weeks, we've become very close,
and your friendship is

23:56.990 --> 24:00.830
everything so I have no bad
words, other than the fact, your

24:00.830 --> 24:01.700
cooking, it needs work.

24:01.700 --> 24:01.990
That's it.

24:01.990 --> 24:02.990
You're a great guy.

24:02.990 --> 24:05.990
Please vote to keep me here.

24:05.990 --> 24:08.540
>> Julie: Thank you, Becky.

24:08.540 --> 24:10.990
Jason, it's your turn.

24:10.990 --> 24:14.990
>> Everyone at "Big Brother" and
everyone that had anything to do

24:14.990 --> 24:16.990
with getting me here, thank you,
very, very much.

24:16.990 --> 24:19.990
To my houseguests, vote for the
person who is going to help your

24:19.990 --> 24:23.990
long-term game here and
hopefully you'll see that as me.

24:23.990 --> 24:27.950
Now, even if I go today, I'm
going to go knowing that I was

24:27.950 --> 24:30.990
true to myself the entire time I
was here.

24:30.990 --> 24:31.990
No regrets.

24:31.990 --> 24:33.990
Just choices.

24:33.990 --> 24:34.990
>> Julie: Thank you, Jason.

24:34.990 --> 24:35.990
Thank you, both.

24:35.990 --> 24:39.990
All right, everyone, it's time
for the live voting to begin.

24:39.990 --> 24:41.990
Vanessa, as head of household,
are you not allowed to vote.

24:41.990 --> 24:43.990
Neither are the two nominees.

24:43.990 --> 24:47.990
One at a time, the rest of you
will enter the diary room and

24:47.990 --> 24:50.290
cast your vote to evict.

24:50.290 --> 24:52.990
Austin, you're up first tonight.

24:52.990 --> 24:59.990
Please go to the diary room.

24:59.990 --> 25:02.990
Austin was almost evicted this
week because of Jason.

25:02.990 --> 25:06.990
Will he take this moment to seek
revenge?

25:06.990 --> 25:06.990
Hello, Austin.

25:06.990 --> 25:08.990
>> Hello, Julie.

25:08.990 --> 25:10.990
>> Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

25:10.990 --> 25:15.990
>> After the week I had I'm
keeping it simple.

25:15.990 --> 25:20.700
I'm voting to evict the
extremely taught Jason.

25:20.700 --> 25:23.540
>> Julie: Meg ask Jason have
been close allies in the house.

25:23.540 --> 25:25.410
She would do anything to keep
him safe.

25:25.410 --> 25:25.990
Hi, Meg.

25:25.990 --> 25:27.990
>> Hi, Julie.

25:27.990 --> 25:28.990
>> Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

25:28.990 --> 25:31.990
>> I vote to evict Becky.

25:31.990 --> 25:32.990
>> Julie: Thank you.

25:32.990 --> 25:35.990
>> Thank you!

25:35.990 --> 25:37.990
>> Julie: Jason exposed Liz
and her twin.

25:37.990 --> 25:41.990
This is her chance to pay him
back.

25:41.990 --> 25:42.990
Hi, Liz.

25:42.990 --> 25:43.990
>> Good evening, Julie.

25:43.990 --> 25:45.990
>> Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

25:45.990 --> 25:49.990
>> I vote to evict Jason.

25:49.990 --> 25:49.990
>> Julie: Thank you.

25:49.990 --> 25:52.990
>> Thank you.

25:52.990 --> 25:54.990
>> Julie: James promised to
help keep Jason safe.

25:54.990 --> 25:58.990
Will he follow through with his
vote?

25:58.990 --> 25:58.990
Hi, James.

25:58.990 --> 26:00.990
>> Hey, Julie.

26:00.990 --> 26:02.990
>> Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

26:02.990 --> 26:05.990
>> I vote to evict Becky jewel.

26:05.990 --> 26:06.830
>> Julie: Thank you.

26:06.830 --> 26:09.990
>> Thank you, Julie.

26:09.990 --> 26:12.990
>> Julie: Steve surprised us
with his strong dislike of

26:12.990 --> 26:13.990
Becky.

26:13.990 --> 26:14.990
Is it enough to vote her out of
the game?

26:14.990 --> 26:15.410
Hi, Steve.

26:15.410 --> 26:18.990
>> Hi, Julie.

26:18.990 --> 26:22.410
>> Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

26:22.410 --> 26:26.990
With respect, get to steppin',
Jason.

26:26.990 --> 26:30.990
>> Julie: Jackie is in a tough
spot, seeing both of her allies

26:30.990 --> 26:31.990
up on the block.

26:31.990 --> 26:33.990
What will she do?

26:33.990 --> 26:34.990
Hi, Jackie.

26:34.990 --> 26:36.540
>> Hi, Julie.

26:36.540 --> 26:38.990
>> Julie: Please cast
your vote to evict.

26:38.990 --> 26:41.990
>> I sadly vote to evict Jason.

26:41.990 --> 26:41.990
>> Thank you.

26:41.990 --> 26:43.990
>> Thank you.

26:43.990 --> 26:47.990
>> Julie: Although she was in
on Jason's blindside, Shelli has

26:47.990 --> 26:51.990
been conflicted about voting him
out of the house.

26:51.990 --> 26:52.990
Hi, Shelli.

26:52.990 --> 26:54.990
>> Hi, Julie.

26:54.990 --> 26:55.990
>> Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

26:55.990 --> 26:58.990
>> I vote to evict Jason.

26:58.990 --> 26:58.990
>> Julie: Thank you.

26:58.990 --> 26:59.990
>> Hi, family.

26:59.990 --> 27:03.000
I love you all!

27:03.000 --> 27:04.990
>> Julie: It's official.

27:04.990 --> 27:08.990
With five votes to evict Jason,
Jason will leave the house

27:08.990 --> 27:09.990
tonight.

27:09.990 --> 27:11.990
But let's see how the other
votes fall.

27:11.990 --> 27:12.990
Hi, Clay.

27:12.990 --> 27:13.990
>> Hey, Julie.

27:13.990 --> 27:15.990
>> Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

27:15.990 --> 27:19.990
>> Sadly I vote to evict Jason.

27:19.990 --> 27:20.990
>> Julie: Thank you.

27:20.990 --> 27:21.990
>> Thank you.

27:21.990 --> 27:26.990
>> Julie: John seems to have a
flirt-mance with Becky.

27:26.990 --> 27:28.990
Is it enough to keep her in the
game?

27:28.990 --> 27:30.290
Hi, John.

27:30.290 --> 27:30.990
>> Hi.

27:30.990 --> 27:32.000
>> Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.990
>> I vote to evict Jason.

27:34.990 --> 27:36.700
Sorry, buddy.

27:36.700 --> 27:48.120
>> Julie: Thank you.

27:48.120 --> 27:50.990
>> Julie: All of the votes are
in.

27:50.990 --> 27:53.990
Let's give the news to the
houseguests.

27:53.990 --> 27:55.990
Houseguests, the votes are in.

27:55.990 --> 28:00.990
When I reveal the vote, the
evicted houseguest will have

28:00.990 --> 28:05.540
just a few moments to say
good-bye, gather his or her

28:05.540 --> 28:08.990
belongings, and walk out the
front door.

28:08.990 --> 28:14.990
By a vote of 7-2, Jason, you are
evicted from the "Big Brother"

28:14.990 --> 28:26.990
house.

28:26.990 --> 28:27.990
>> Be strong.

28:27.990 --> 28:30.410
>> Go get them, little
goblin.

28:30.410 --> 28:31.120
>> Bye, everybody, play hard.

28:31.120 --> 28:31.990
Play hard.

28:31.990 --> 28:32.990
This is "Big Brother."

28:32.990 --> 28:40.000
I do want to sit at home and see
you all being lazy.

28:40.000 --> 28:47.950
( Cheers and applause )
Hi, Julie!

28:47.950 --> 28:47.990
Hi!

28:47.990 --> 28:53.990
Oh, my God!

28:53.990 --> 28:59.990
>> Holy cow!

28:59.990 --> 29:02.120
>> Oh, no, I don't want to see
it.

29:02.120 --> 29:09.990
>> Wow.

29:09.990 --> 29:19.990
>> Sorry.

29:19.990 --> 29:26.990
>> Sorry.

29:26.990 --> 29:28.990
>> Julie: Jason.

29:28.990 --> 29:29.120
>> Julie.

29:29.120 --> 29:31.990
>> Julie: You were completely
caught off guard.

29:31.990 --> 29:32.990
>> Yes!

29:32.990 --> 29:35.990
>> Julie: At the veto ceremony
when you were named by Vanessa

29:35.990 --> 29:38.990
as a replacement nominee.

29:38.990 --> 29:40.990
You're a huge superfan of this
game.

29:40.990 --> 29:40.990
>> I know.

29:40.990 --> 29:43.990
>> Julie: You know every
angle.

29:43.990 --> 29:44.990
How did you not see this coming?

29:44.990 --> 29:47.990
>> You know, I was naive to
think that this dark moon thing

29:47.990 --> 29:51.290
was real-- that I really could
believe the loyalty with these
people.

29:51.290 --> 29:54.000
And it was actually that night I
sat with Meg and I said, "we're

29:54.000 --> 29:55.700
in a good spot.

29:55.700 --> 29:56.990
I feel pretty comfortable."

29:56.990 --> 29:58.990
And I know from this game the
minute you feel comfortable, you

29:58.990 --> 29:59.990
are in trouble.

29:59.990 --> 30:01.990
>> Julie: That is for sure.

30:01.990 --> 30:04.700
Who do you feel betrayed you the
most?

30:04.700 --> 30:07.990
>> I would say clellie.

30:07.990 --> 30:11.990
I would definitely think that
Shelli is evil personified.

30:11.990 --> 30:13.990
And I think they're running it.

30:13.990 --> 30:16.290
>> Julie: And what are your
thoughts on Vanessa?

30:16.290 --> 30:20.120
>> I think Vanessa, honestly,
when it comes down to it, she's

30:20.120 --> 30:20.990
a smart game player.

30:20.990 --> 30:23.990
It was probably a smart move for
her, but she also is a little

30:23.990 --> 30:28.000
bit more emotional, and I would
say has a little bit more soul.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.990
>> Julie: You've been
nominated-- you were nominated

30:30.990 --> 30:32.990
three times--
>> forever!

30:32.990 --> 30:35.120
>> Julie: Three times and the
fourth time on the block was

30:35.120 --> 30:38.540
just this past week as a
replacement nom.

30:38.540 --> 30:41.990
Why do you think the are others
saw you as such a threat?

30:41.990 --> 30:44.120
>> You know, I wonder that.

30:44.120 --> 30:47.990
Maybe when I watch it back it
will be clear why I was such a

30:47.990 --> 30:48.990
big threat.

30:48.990 --> 30:52.000
Le ifeel like backdoing me this
week is shooting fish in a

30:52.000 --> 30:52.990
barrel.

30:52.990 --> 30:56.990
Obviously, they see something in
me that maybe I don't recognize.

30:56.990 --> 30:59.990
>> Julie: Well, you are a
smart player.

30:59.990 --> 31:00.990
>> Thank you.

31:00.990 --> 31:03.990
>> Julie: And you Da'vonne--
>> my girl.

31:03.990 --> 31:06.990
>> Julie: You figured out--
>> that there was a twist.

31:06.990 --> 31:09.990
>> Julie: The twin twist, Liz
and Julia, switching things out
every few days.

31:09.990 --> 31:13.990
When you figured it, you didn't
use it as strategy.

31:13.990 --> 31:15.990
You started just gossiping.

31:15.990 --> 31:16.990
>> Gossiping to everyone!

31:16.990 --> 31:19.990
>> Julie: So did Jason the fan
override--

31:19.990 --> 31:20.990
>> Jason the player?

31:20.990 --> 31:21.990
Probably.

31:21.990 --> 31:23.990
Because you're so bored in
there.

31:23.990 --> 31:26.990
You find out there are twins and
you just want to tell everyone!

31:26.990 --> 31:26.990
( Laughter ).

31:26.990 --> 31:29.990
>> Julie: Was that a huge
downfall,.

31:29.990 --> 31:30.950
>> Probably.

31:30.950 --> 31:31.990
>> Julie: Thinking back.

31:31.990 --> 31:32.990
>> Probably.

31:32.990 --> 31:36.990
>> Julie: Now, the house, as
you have discovered is divided.

31:36.990 --> 31:37.990
>> Yes.

31:37.990 --> 31:41.990
>> Julie: On one side we have
Shelli, Clay, Vanessa, Austin,

31:41.990 --> 31:43.990
Liz, and Julia, the twins.

31:43.990 --> 31:47.990
On the other side are your
allies, Meg, Jackie, and James.

31:47.990 --> 31:52.990
Can Meg, Jackie and James
survive without you and survive

31:52.990 --> 31:53.990
in this game?

31:53.990 --> 31:56.120
>> They're going to have to try
to.

31:56.120 --> 31:58.990
If this is an endurance comp
tonight, they need to hold on

31:58.990 --> 31:59.990
until September.

31:59.990 --> 32:03.990
So I'm hoping-- we all know my
girl Meg has the jello legs.

32:03.990 --> 32:06.990
She might not be too good out of
it.

32:06.990 --> 32:09.990
But honestly, out of everyone
Meg has a very good chance of

32:09.990 --> 32:10.540
making it far in this game.

32:10.540 --> 32:11.990
People might keep overlooking
her.

32:11.990 --> 32:13.990
I'm pulling for Meg.

32:13.990 --> 32:14.990
But I'm pulling for all my
people.

32:14.990 --> 32:21.990
If they win the comps they can
maybe slide on through.

32:25.410 --> 32:27.990
>> Jason, I know that you have
so many questions and I want to

32:27.990 --> 32:28.990
give you some answers.

32:28.990 --> 32:32.990
I'm in a six-person alliance
called the 6th sense, and I

32:32.990 --> 32:35.990
absolutely hate that you ended
up having to go up on the block.

32:35.990 --> 32:39.990
I absolutely adore you, and you
are going to be so incredibly
missed in this house.

32:39.990 --> 32:43.700
>> Jason, if there's one person
that should have won this game,

32:43.700 --> 32:44.990
it's definitely you.

32:44.990 --> 32:48.410
You know I love you so much, and
I can't wait to see you after

32:48.410 --> 32:48.990
this.

32:48.990 --> 32:49.830
Take care, baby.

32:49.830 --> 32:50.990
>> Hey, Jason.

32:50.990 --> 32:54.410
So I know you thought that you
had one up on me and my sister.

32:54.410 --> 32:58.990
But she's coming in to this
house, and you're going home.

32:58.990 --> 33:01.990
Have fun watching from mom's
basement.

33:01.990 --> 33:04.990
>> Oohh, what a--
>> Jason, clearly this is the

33:04.990 --> 33:05.990
toughest one for me.

33:05.990 --> 33:07.990
I'm trying to hold it together.

33:07.990 --> 33:09.990
I miss you so much already.

33:09.990 --> 33:12.990
I don't know what I'm going to
do in this house without you.

33:12.990 --> 33:15.990
Love you.

33:15.990 --> 33:17.990
>> Julie: Before we say
good-bye.

33:17.990 --> 33:18.120
>> Yes.

33:18.120 --> 33:19.990
>> Julie: Any final thoughts?

33:19.990 --> 33:24.540
>> I was right about everything.

33:24.540 --> 33:27.990
I knew you couldn't trust Shelli
from the very first week.

33:27.990 --> 33:30.290
I knew the twins were just evil
down to the core.

33:30.290 --> 33:33.990
And I knew Meg was one of the
sweet girls in the world.

33:33.990 --> 33:35.990
>> Julie: We wish you the best
of luck.

33:35.990 --> 33:37.990
>> Thank you, Julie.

33:37.990 --> 33:38.990
>> Julie: Thank you, Jason.

33:38.990 --> 33:39.540
Stay right there.

33:39.540 --> 33:42.290
Up next, when they last swapped
places the twins were nominated

33:42.290 --> 33:46.990
for eviction, but Julia who has
been in sequester has no idea

33:46.990 --> 33:49.990
that Liz won the battle of the
block securing their entry into

33:49.990 --> 33:52.990
the game to play as individual
houseguests.

33:52.990 --> 33:57.990
She finds out live, enters the
house, and joins her sister

33:57.990 --> 33:58.950
next.

33:58.950 --> 34:00.990
Stay with us.

34:29.410 --> 34:30.990
>> Julie: Welcome back to "big
brother."

34:30.990 --> 34:34.700
Sitting me right now is Julia,
who is about to find out her

34:34.700 --> 34:34.990
fate.

34:34.990 --> 34:39.410
All right, Julia, as you and
your twin sister, Liz, know, the

34:39.410 --> 34:42.990
rules were the two of you had to
make it through five evictions

34:42.990 --> 34:46.990
in order to enter the house and
play as individual houseguests.

34:46.990 --> 34:51.990
And just moments ago, we did
have our fifth eviction.

34:51.990 --> 34:54.990
So one of two things is about to
happen.

34:54.990 --> 34:59.990
Either you're going home because
your sister was just evicted, or

34:59.990 --> 35:02.540
you're entering the house
because she survived.

35:02.540 --> 35:05.990
Are you ready to find out your
fate?

35:05.990 --> 35:06.950
>> Yes.

35:06.950 --> 35:06.990
>> Julie: Are you nervous?

35:06.990 --> 35:11.990
>> I can feel my heart pounding
out of my chest.

35:11.990 --> 35:13.990
>> Julie: All right.

35:13.990 --> 35:17.990
Well, unfortunately, as you
know, Liz was nominated for

35:17.990 --> 35:20.990
eviction, but a lot can happen
in the "Big Brother" house.

35:20.990 --> 35:21.700
>> Yeah.

35:21.700 --> 35:24.990
>> Julie: And a lot did happen
in the "Big Brother" house.

35:24.990 --> 35:26.990
Your sister won the battle of
the block.

35:26.990 --> 35:29.410
>> Oh, my God.

35:29.410 --> 35:31.990
>> Julie: So that means not
only is she safe but you're

35:31.990 --> 35:35.950
safe, and that means you two
have earned your way into the

35:35.950 --> 35:37.990
"Big Brother" house.

35:37.990 --> 35:40.990
Start making your way in there
now.

35:40.990 --> 35:41.990
Congratulations.

35:41.990 --> 35:44.990
And I will alert the others that
you're on your way.

35:44.990 --> 35:45.990
The door is right there.

35:45.990 --> 35:47.990
>> Okay, thank you.

35:47.990 --> 35:54.990
>> Julie: You're welcome.

35:54.990 --> 35:55.990
Houseguests.

35:55.990 --> 36:02.990
I need everyone to please gather
in the living room right now.

36:02.990 --> 36:04.990
Take a seat.

36:04.990 --> 36:07.990
Get comfortable.

36:07.990 --> 36:08.990
All right.

36:08.990 --> 36:10.990
Looks like you're all there.

36:10.990 --> 36:15.990
Well, there has been a lot of
speculation surrounding a twin

36:15.990 --> 36:17.120
twist.

36:17.120 --> 36:21.000
And it's time to put that all to
rest.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.990
There was indeed a twin twist.

36:22.990 --> 36:27.540
One of you has been playing the
game with an identical twin.

36:27.540 --> 36:39.990
So please say hello to your new
housemate, Julia.

36:39.990 --> 36:49.990
>> Oh, my God!

36:49.990 --> 36:51.990
>> Whoa!

37:02.990 --> 37:06.540
>> It's as if we know her but we
don't know her.

37:06.540 --> 37:07.990
>> I know!

37:07.990 --> 37:09.990
>> Julie: All right,
houseguests, I need everyone's

37:09.990 --> 37:10.990
attention.

37:10.990 --> 37:15.990
For the record, Liz and Julia
had to survive five evictions in

37:15.990 --> 37:19.000
order to both play the game as
individual houseguests.

37:19.000 --> 37:24.990
Over the last 43 days, they
switched places 14 times.

37:24.990 --> 37:25.950
>> Wow.

37:25.950 --> 37:26.990
>> Nice!

37:26.990 --> 37:29.990
>> Julie: Now that they are
both in the game, it means that

37:29.990 --> 37:37.990
the twin twist is officially
over, and the game is resetting.

37:37.990 --> 37:43.990
So the battle of the block is
also over.

37:43.990 --> 37:47.990
That means, ladies and
gentlemen, from this moment on,

37:47.990 --> 37:54.990
there will be just one head of
household every week, and two

37:54.990 --> 37:55.290
nominees.

37:55.290 --> 37:55.990
>> All right!

37:55.990 --> 37:59.120
>> Julie: With, that it's time
to get ready, houseguests,

37:59.120 --> 38:02.990
because tonight you will
participate in a grueling battle

38:02.990 --> 38:05.540
of endurance.

38:05.540 --> 38:09.410
The first solo h.O.H. Of the
summer.

38:09.410 --> 38:13.990
Head to the backyard, and we
will begin in just a few

38:13.990 --> 38:14.990
moments.

38:14.990 --> 38:17.990
Who will become the single most
powerful player in the game?

38:17.990 --> 38:23.990
The biggest head of household
competition of the summer begins
next.

38:23.990 --> 38:24.990
Stay with us.

38:42.990 --> 38:44.990
>> Julie: Welcome back to "big
brother."

38:44.990 --> 38:46.990
It's now time to crown a new
head of household.

38:46.990 --> 38:50.120
Who will become the most
powerful houseguest in the game?

38:50.120 --> 38:55.000
Let's head to the backyard and
get things started.

38:55.000 --> 38:55.990
Houseguests.

38:55.990 --> 38:58.990
The power is back up for grabs.

38:58.990 --> 39:02.990
Vanessa, as outgoing head of
household, you are not eligible

39:02.990 --> 39:03.990
to compete.

39:03.990 --> 39:09.990
This competition is called "on
the edge, "and the rules are

39:09.990 --> 39:13.990
simple-- hang on to the
crumbling cliff for dear life

39:13.990 --> 39:19.830
because if you fall, you will be
eliminated from this

39:19.830 --> 39:19.990
competition.

39:19.990 --> 39:23.700
The last houseguest left on the
cliff's edge will be the new

39:23.700 --> 39:24.990
h.O.H.

39:24.990 --> 39:25.990
Everyone understand?

39:25.990 --> 39:26.990
>> Yes.

39:26.990 --> 39:27.990
>> Yes.

39:27.990 --> 39:28.950
>> Julie: Excellent.

39:28.950 --> 39:33.410
Them hold on tight, houseguests,
because this competition begins

39:33.410 --> 39:35.990
now.

39:35.990 --> 39:38.990
>> Oh, come on!

39:38.990 --> 39:46.410
A tiltin' wall?

39:46.410 --> 39:48.990
>> I don't like those eagles.

39:48.990 --> 40:00.990
>> Whoops.

40:00.990 --> 40:04.120
>> Hmmm!

40:04.120 --> 40:15.990
Hmmm!

40:15.990 --> 40:18.990
>> Julie: Looking good,
houseguests, but I would watch

40:18.990 --> 40:24.990
my footing, if I were you,
because there's a storm brewing.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.990
>> Oh, come on, Julie!

40:26.990 --> 40:31.990
( Screaming )
>> Oh, that's cold!

40:31.990 --> 40:36.990
>> Oh, yeah, baby!

40:36.990 --> 40:38.990
>> I should have been a have-not
this week.

40:46.990 --> 40:55.990
>> It will take your breath
away.

40:55.990 --> 41:00.990
>> Oh, milanta.

41:00.990 --> 41:03.120
>> Julie: Battle lines have
been drawn making this the most

41:03.120 --> 41:04.990
important head of household
competition yet.

41:04.990 --> 41:07.990
The drama continues when we
return.

41:07.990 --> 41:09.990
Stay with us.

41:35.950 --> 41:37.540
>> Julie: Welcome back to "big
brother."

41:37.540 --> 41:41.990
Who will become the sole head of
household, and who will he or

41:41.990 --> 41:42.990
she nominate for eviction?

41:42.990 --> 41:44.990
Tune in Sunday to find out.

41:44.990 --> 41:48.990
Then, will the power of veto
continue to shake up the game?

41:48.990 --> 41:50.540
Find out Wednesday.

41:50.540 --> 41:56.990
And one week from tonight, it's
another live eviction.

41:56.990 --> 42:02.990
Head to CBS.Com/bb17 and
subscribe to CBS all access to

42:02.990 --> 42:03.990
get the live feeds and more.

42:03.990 --> 42:06.950
For now, let's return to the
backyard and check in on the

42:06.950 --> 42:07.990
houseguests.

42:07.990 --> 42:08.990
Hello, again, houseguests.

42:08.990 --> 42:09.990
>> Hi!

42:09.990 --> 42:10.990
>> Julie!

42:10.990 --> 42:12.990
>> Julie: Everyone's looking
good.

42:12.990 --> 42:14.990
You're all still in this
competition.

42:14.990 --> 42:18.990
However, I do suggest that you
hold on tight because it looks

42:18.990 --> 42:28.990
like you've got some company.

42:28.990 --> 42:33.990
Like you've got some company.

42:33.990 --> 42:43.950
>> Bye, Julie!

42:43.950 --> 42:44.990
>> Oh, my God.

42:44.990 --> 42:48.990
This is ridiculous.

42:48.990 --> 42:52.990
>> Ow!

42:52.990 --> 42:53.990
>> Come on, baby.

42:53.990 --> 42:55.700
That's all you've got!

42:55.700 --> 42:58.990
>> I know, that really hurt.

42:58.990 --> 43:02.990
>> My makeup is all over the
bald eagle.

43:02.990 --> 43:08.830
>> Oh!

43:08.830 --> 43:09.990
>> Holy crap!

43:09.990 --> 43:12.990
>> Oh, wow.

43:12.990 --> 43:14.990
What's that?

43:14.990 --> 43:16.990
>> Something pretty.

43:16.990 --> 43:17.830
>> Intense slope here.

43:17.830 --> 43:18.830
>> It's very intense.

43:18.830 --> 43:19.990
>> That's not good for me.
