WEBVTT

00:00.531 --> 00:05.036
в™Єв™Є

00:05.036 --> 00:09.110
ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

00:09.110 --> 00:11.182
WELL, THAT DEPENDS.

00:11.182 --> 00:12.683
WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND?

00:12.683 --> 00:17.148
NEIGHBOR-ON-NEIGHBOR STYLE
ALL NIGHT LONG.

00:22.223 --> 00:25.596
(dog barking)

00:25.596 --> 00:29.029
OH, DAMN IT, TUFFY!

00:29.029 --> 00:31.702
I WILL CUT OUT YOUR TONGUE
AND SHOW IT TO YOU!

00:31.702 --> 00:34.165
SO YOU HAD A SEX DREAM
ABOUT ME, HUH?

00:34.165 --> 00:37.138
RELAX, STUD. I HAVE
SEX DREAMS ABOUT EVERYBODY--

00:37.138 --> 00:39.340
THE PRESIDENT,
GENE SIMMONS,

00:39.340 --> 00:43.144
EDWARD FROM "TWILIGHT"--
OOH, THAT SWEET EDWARD. MM.

00:43.144 --> 00:46.147
(Tuffy barking)
THAT IS WHY I CAME BY.

00:46.147 --> 00:48.149
I THOUGHT YOU COULD
TALK TO MR. ROSE

00:48.149 --> 00:51.552
ABOUT HIS
YAPPY LITTLE RAT-DOG.
YEAH, THAT'S--
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.355
LOOK, YOU AND I ARE
ALREADY AMAZING FRIENDS.
WE ARE NOT.

00:54.355 --> 00:56.727
WE ARE, BUT I THINK
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE

00:56.727 --> 00:59.390
TO GET IN GOOD WITH THE REST
OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:59.390 --> 01:02.763
I'M NOT REALLY LOOKING TO BE
PART OF YOUR CUL-DE-SAC CREW.

01:02.763 --> 01:05.496
COME ON, YOU HAVE TO DO THIS.
MR. ROSE DOESN'T LIKE ME

01:05.496 --> 01:08.369
BECAUSE OF OUR DUELING
YARD SALES LAST SUMMER.

01:08.369 --> 01:11.071
I BLEW HIM OUT OF THE WATER.
I MEAN, SORRY, BUDDY.

01:11.071 --> 01:14.074
NOBODY WANTS
YOUR DEAD WIFE'S LIPSTICK,

01:14.074 --> 01:15.706
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

01:15.706 --> 01:18.349
YOU KNOW WHY YOU'RE OUR FAVORITE
MORTGAGE BROKER, LARRY?

01:18.349 --> 01:21.382
AND IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE OF
YOUR PROMOTIONAL STRESS BALLS,

01:21.382 --> 01:24.755
ALTHOUGH THIS THING IS GREAT.
(chuckles) I HEAR YOU.

01:24.755 --> 01:26.657
YOU DO HEAR ME,
DON'T YOU, LARRY?

01:26.657 --> 01:29.120
THAT'S WHY I LOVE
WORKING WITH YOU.

01:29.120 --> 01:32.593
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO STOP WITH WORK.

01:32.593 --> 01:35.196
YOU WANT TO GRAB
A COFFEE LATER?

01:35.196 --> 01:37.228
(squeaking)
I CAN'T TONIGHT.

01:37.228 --> 01:40.471
UM, I HAVE TO, UH,
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO, LAURIE?

01:40.471 --> 01:42.803
YOU'RE PLAYING CHESS
WITH THE HOMELESS.

01:42.803 --> 01:45.876
YOU'RE ONE OF THE GOOD ONES.
WELL--

01:45.876 --> 01:47.308
I GOTTA GO.
YOU GOT MY NUMBER.

01:47.308 --> 01:49.840
I SURE DO, RIGHT HERE
ON THIS BALL. (chuckles)

01:53.384 --> 01:57.148
DID THAT MAN WHO I WISH WAS
MY FATHER JUST ASK ME OUT?

01:57.148 --> 01:59.250
YEAH.
I THINK LARRY LOVES YOU.

01:59.250 --> 02:03.194
YOU KNOW, I'LL BET HE WAS
SUCH A STUD IN HIS DAY.

02:03.194 --> 02:05.596
OH, HE CAN'T FIND HIS CAR.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.201
OH!

02:10.201 --> 02:13.434
THANKS FOR LETTING ME
SLEEP IN, BABE. I WAS UP LATE.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.906
YOU KNOW WHAT'S COOL
ABOUT PLAYING HEARTS ONLINE?

02:15.906 --> 02:17.768
YEAH. NOTHING.

02:17.768 --> 02:20.811
I WAS WITH OUR SON, CLEANING UP
HIS ADULT-SIZED DOODY.

02:20.811 --> 02:23.143
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR HANDLING THAT.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.315
MMM.

02:24.315 --> 02:26.277
ON A RELATED NOTE,

02:26.277 --> 02:28.279
AFTER I FINISHED SHAVING
THIS MORNING,

02:28.279 --> 02:31.382
I CLEANED ALL OF MY WHISKERS
OUT OF THE SINK.
GOOD.

02:31.382 --> 02:33.854
NO "THANK YOU" FOR ME?
I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND

02:33.854 --> 02:37.858
HOW MANY WHISKERS
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.
I AM AWARE OF
HOW HAIRY YOU ARE.

02:37.858 --> 02:41.432
YEAH, YOU ARE.
LISTEN UP, HALF-PINT.

02:41.432 --> 02:43.394
I'M NOT GONNA THANK YOU
FOR DOING STUFF

02:43.394 --> 02:46.237
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. IF I
DID THAT, I'D HAVE TO THANK YOU

02:46.237 --> 02:50.271
FOR DOING THINGS LIKE
KILLING BUGS OR SUPPORTING ME.

02:50.271 --> 02:53.173
WHEN I HAVE
TO SHAVE AGAIN AT NOON,

02:53.173 --> 02:55.206
I AM NOT CLEANING IT UP!

02:55.206 --> 02:57.908
YOU KNOW HOW I'M BACK
TOGETHER WITH DALE?

02:57.908 --> 03:00.581
HE JUST INVITED ME TO
HIS GIRLFRIEND'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

03:00.581 --> 03:02.583
IT'S NOT WEIRD.
OH.

03:02.583 --> 03:05.656
HE'S GONNA BREAK UP WITH HER
AS SOON AS HE GETS HIS CDs BACK.

03:05.656 --> 03:09.290
SHOULD I GO?
I KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA END,
BUT I'M STILL GONNA DIVE IN.

03:09.290 --> 03:11.622
DO NOT GO!
RUN FROM THIS BACKWOODS LOSER

03:11.622 --> 03:15.496
LIKE HE'S ACTUALLY
TRYING TO KILL YOU.
I'M GONNA GO.

03:15.496 --> 03:18.699
GLAD TO HELP.
HE SOUNDS LIKE HE'S THE ONE.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.632
SERIOUSLY,
HE'LL DEFINITELY MARRY YOU.

03:21.632 --> 03:23.834
LAURIE.

03:23.834 --> 03:26.877
(chuckles) HEY, TRAVIS.
WHAT UP, GIRL?

03:26.877 --> 03:30.411
MM.
QUICK FUNNY STORY. SO I WENT
TO THE VAMPIRE WEEKEND CONCERT.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.383
AWESOME SHOW.
CAUGHT A DRUMSTICK.

03:32.383 --> 03:34.715
(stammers) WHICH IS, YOU KNOW,
IT'S LIKE WHATEVER,

03:34.715 --> 03:36.717
BUT MY FRIEND ALEX
NEARLY HAD A NERD-GASM.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.689
OH, YEAH, I LOVE THAT BAND.

03:38.689 --> 03:40.851
A LOT IN COMMON.

03:40.851 --> 03:43.454
LOT IN COMMON.

03:43.454 --> 03:44.795
(honks horn)

03:44.795 --> 03:46.997
COME ON, TRAVIS,
LET'S GO!

03:46.997 --> 03:48.959
(door closes)
WHAT IS THAT NOISE?

03:48.959 --> 03:51.001
I FOUND A SCOOTER HORN
AT THE DUMP.

03:51.001 --> 03:53.334
I HELPED HIM WIRE IT UP.
IT'S PRETTY RAD.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.666
IS IT RAD, ANDY?
GET INSIDE.

03:57.768 --> 04:01.842
LOOK, E-TRAIN, I KNOW YOU WENT
SOUTH ON ME AFTER THE DIVORCE,

04:01.842 --> 04:04.875
AND I RESPECT THAT, BUT JULES
AND I ARE COPACETIC NOW.

04:04.875 --> 04:08.519
CAN'T WE JUST
BURY THE HATCHET?

04:12.683 --> 04:15.526
I HAVE TO GO HOME NOW.
MM-HMM.

04:15.526 --> 04:17.488
HEY, I'M HAPPY
ABOUT BOBBY'S NEW HORN.

04:17.488 --> 04:20.491
THE ODDS OF MY SON DYING
IN A GOLF CART ACCIDENT

04:20.491 --> 04:23.364
JUST WENT FROM
DEFINITELY TO PROBABLY.
OH, GOOD.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.936
LISTEN, I HAVE NOTHING
TO DO TONIGHT. LET'S HANG.

04:25.936 --> 04:27.968
I CAN'T. IT'S DATE NIGHT.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.971
IT MIGHT BE FUN, THOUGH,
'CAUSE THERE'S NO SEX PRESSURE.

04:30.971 --> 04:33.003
ANDY'S ALLERGY MEDICATIONS

04:33.003 --> 04:36.647
ARE CAUSING SOME
EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTIONS.
DON'T HAVE TO TELL
JULES EVERYTHING.

04:36.647 --> 04:39.650
(indistinct shouting)
OH, I'M SORRY, JULES.
I CAN'T HANG.

04:39.650 --> 04:41.652
I'M RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING.

04:41.652 --> 04:43.954
JUST GIVE HIM HIS CREED ALBUMS
BACK, YOU BITCH!

04:43.954 --> 04:46.056
HE DOESN'T LOVE YOU!
(shouting continuing)

04:46.056 --> 04:47.558
YOU STILL THERE?

04:47.558 --> 04:50.491
NO CAN DO, MOM.
DAD FOUND A BAG OF FIREWORKS,

04:50.491 --> 04:52.793
SO OUR NIGHT IS
SORT OF SPOKEN FOR.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.866
I WOULDN'T GET TOO CLOSE TO
THAT PUMPKIN IF I WERE YOU.

04:55.866 --> 04:56.867
WHAT?

04:56.867 --> 05:00.070
(screams, laughs) AWESOME!

05:00.070 --> 05:02.903
OHH! (spits)
SOME GOT IN MY MOUTH!

05:02.903 --> 05:04.605
(both laugh)

05:04.605 --> 05:06.607
BYE.

05:06.607 --> 05:07.908
(beep)

05:18.849 --> 05:20.491
(telephone rings)
(snores)

05:20.491 --> 05:22.723
THIS IS LARRY.

05:22.723 --> 05:25.856
OH, OKAY. THIS IS JULES.

05:25.856 --> 05:29.099
(chuckles) UH, IF YOU STILL
WANT TO GRAB THAT CUP OF COFFEE,

05:29.099 --> 05:31.932
UM, YOU KNOW, JUST AS FRIENDS,
I'M FREE TONIGHT.

05:34.565 --> 05:35.906
LARRY?

05:35.906 --> 05:37.838
(snores, clears throat)
THIS IS LARRY.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.110
GREAT.

05:40.110 --> 05:42.042
GOOD NIGHT, LARRY.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.744
KISS?

05:43.744 --> 05:45.676
OH,
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

05:45.676 --> 05:47.978
BUT THANKS.
IT WAS REALLY FUN.

05:47.978 --> 05:49.980
BYE NOW.

05:51.582 --> 05:53.784
OH, NO.

05:53.784 --> 05:56.356
OH, YES.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.358
(Tuffy barking)

05:58.358 --> 06:02.963
в™Є SHE LIKES A PACEMAKER,
SHE'S A HIP BREAKER в™Є

06:02.963 --> 06:06.637
в™Є SHE LIKES THEM
ALMOST DEAD в™Є

06:06.637 --> 06:09.700
THAT'S ALL I'VE WRITTEN SO FAR,
BUT I'M VERY PROUD OF IT.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.371
IT'S HAUNTING.

06:11.371 --> 06:14.405
YOU KNOW THAT GIRL I WAS WITH?
SHE IS 11 YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME.

06:14.405 --> 06:16.847
IF YOU ADD THAT
TO THE AGE DIFFERENCE

06:16.847 --> 06:20.581
BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR DATE,
IT'S 611 YEARS.

06:20.581 --> 06:23.484
MINE WASN'T A DATE, OKAY?
I JUST WENT OUT FOR SOME COFFEE.

06:23.484 --> 06:27.387
YOU CAN'T STAND TO BE ALONE
FOR A SECOND, CAN YOU?
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.120
THEN WHY DID YOU GO OUT
WITH FATHER TIME?

06:30.120 --> 06:33.123
BECAUSE I AM A HISTORY BUFF,
AND I HAVEN'T BEEN IN A CAR

06:33.123 --> 06:35.626
WITH ONLY A LAP BELT
IN A LONG TIME.

06:35.626 --> 06:38.499
SO... AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GOING HOME RIGHT NOW

06:38.499 --> 06:41.972
TO AN EMPTY HOUSE ALONE.
(strumming minor chords)

06:41.972 --> 06:44.535
NO. NOT A SAD MOMENT.

06:44.535 --> 06:46.106
IT'S TRIUMPHANT.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.508
I GOT IT.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.810
(plays chords rhythmically)

06:49.810 --> 06:51.542
BETTER.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.820
SO DALE AND I HOOKED UP
LAST NIGHT,

06:59.820 --> 07:01.892
AND WHEN I WOKE UP,
HE WASN'T HERE,

07:01.892 --> 07:04.024
AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.096
ANOTHER PROUD MORNING.

07:06.096 --> 07:08.058
WILL YOU COME AND FIND ME?

07:08.058 --> 07:10.430
I CAN SEE A FENCE,

07:10.430 --> 07:14.565
A TREE AND A CLOUD SHAPED
LIKE MASHED POTATOES.

07:14.565 --> 07:17.137
(door closes)
HONEY, NORMALLY I WOULD
TYPE THAT INTO MY G.P.S.,

07:17.137 --> 07:19.670
BUT CAN YOU JUST PLEASE TRY
TO FIND YOUR OWN WAY HOME?

07:19.670 --> 07:21.512
ALL RIGHT? LOVE YOU.
(beep)

07:21.512 --> 07:23.213
I THOUGHT
YOU'D WANT HER HERE

07:23.213 --> 07:25.215
SO YOU WOULDN'T BE
ALL BY YOUR LONESOMES.

07:25.215 --> 07:27.678
BUDDY, THOSE LITTLE PAINTED
ROSES ON YOUR TINY GUITAR

07:27.678 --> 07:30.080
LOOK PRETTY GIRLY.

07:30.080 --> 07:34.454
в™Є CONFIDENT
IN MY SEXUALITAY в™Є

07:34.454 --> 07:36.727
I WILL BET YOU 20 BUCKS

07:36.727 --> 07:39.490
THAT YOU CAN'T SPEND
THE ENTIRE DAY BY YOURSELF.

07:39.490 --> 07:43.033
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
I LOVE TO BE BY MYSELF.

07:43.033 --> 07:44.795
(chuckles) HEY, ELLIE!

07:44.795 --> 07:45.996
WHAT?

07:45.996 --> 07:48.769
DON'T COME OVER TODAY.
WHY AM I BEING PUNISHED?

07:48.769 --> 07:50.901
I'LL EXPLAIN AT MIDNIGHT.

07:50.901 --> 07:52.803
ALL RIGHT, GREAT.
THE BET STARTS NOW.
(door opens and closes)

07:52.803 --> 07:54.474
J-BIRD.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.947
WHOA! .5 SECONDS.
I JUST WON 20 BUCKS.

07:56.947 --> 07:59.149
NICE!
SOUNDS LIKE I WAS INVOLVED.

07:59.149 --> 08:02.112
SHOULD WE GO SPLITSIES?
WOW, YOU SEE AN OPPORTUNITY
TO GET CASH,

08:02.112 --> 08:04.084
AND YOU JUST DIVE
RIGHT IN THERE, DON'T YOU?

08:04.084 --> 08:06.156
G.A.C.

08:06.156 --> 08:08.058
"GUILTY AS CHARGED."
I TAUGHT HIM THAT.

08:08.058 --> 08:11.892
I REGRET IT.
T-REX AND I ARE GONNA FIRE UP
THE GRILL AND HAVE A B-B-Q.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.894
I NEED A PLACE TO PUT THE RIBS.

08:13.894 --> 08:17.067
CAN I, UH, THROW AWAY
YOUR LEAN CUISINES?
NO, THOSE ARE MINE.

08:17.067 --> 08:19.930
JULES.
DOESN'T MEAN HE'S GAY, BOBBY.

08:19.930 --> 08:21.772
SORRY I LIKE
WELL-BALANCED MEALS.

08:21.772 --> 08:24.835
OKAY, AS SOON
AS THESE GUYS LEAVE, BET STARTS.

08:24.835 --> 08:29.509
(falsetto voice)
в™Є YOU'RE GONNA OWE ME 20 BUCKS в™Є

08:29.509 --> 08:33.744
LEAVE?
IT'S BARBECUE SATURDAY.
OH, YOU JUST MADE THAT UP.

08:33.744 --> 08:36.016
(door opens and closes)
G.A.C.

08:36.016 --> 08:39.850
в™Є CONFIDENT IN MY SEXUALITAY в™Є

08:39.850 --> 08:42.192
WOW. THAT COULD BE
MY NEW FAVORITE SONG.
GOOD LUCK BEING ALONE, MOM.

08:42.192 --> 08:44.054
I SO GOT THIS.

08:44.054 --> 08:45.996
(humming)

08:45.996 --> 08:50.230
в™Є CONFIDENT IN MY SEXUALITAY в™Є
(hums)

08:50.230 --> 08:53.233
в™Є JUST LIKE MARISKA HARGITAY в™Є

08:53.233 --> 08:55.065
(sniffs) WOW.

08:55.065 --> 08:58.909
в™Є CONFIDENT IN MY SEXUALITAY в™Є
MMM.

08:58.909 --> 09:01.041
(sniffs, coughs)

09:01.041 --> 09:03.814
в™Є GOT A PEDICURE
THE OTHER DAY в™Є

09:03.814 --> 09:07.047
в™Є I WEAR PINK SHIRTS
AND FANCY SHOES в™Є

09:07.047 --> 09:09.720
в™Є I MOISTURIZE
AND LOOK GOOD IN BLUE в™Є

09:09.720 --> 09:10.951
(sighs)

09:10.951 --> 09:12.953
в™Є I DRINK CABERNET в™Є

09:12.953 --> 09:15.285
в™Є CABERNET в™Є

09:15.285 --> 09:19.189
в™Є CONFIDENT IN MY SEXUALITAY в™Є

09:19.189 --> 09:24.765
в™Є DROVE MY HYBRID
TO THE BALLET в™Є

09:24.765 --> 09:26.066
в™Є CONFIDENT IN MY SEXUALITAY в™Є

09:26.066 --> 09:29.169
22 MINUTES. THAT'S IT?

09:29.169 --> 09:31.101
(Tuffy barking)
в™Є JUST LIKE MARISKA HARGITAY в™Є

09:31.101 --> 09:33.103
YOU SUCK, TUFFY!

09:33.103 --> 09:36.106
(barking continues)

09:38.949 --> 09:39.980
(snarling)

09:39.980 --> 09:41.712
(gasps)

09:47.587 --> 09:49.720
HE--HE--HE--HE--HE--

09:49.720 --> 09:51.892
YOU'RE INSIDE. IT'S SAFE.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.824
HE CRAWLED
TOWARD THE BUSHES.

09:53.824 --> 09:56.296
LITTLE GUY PROBABLY JUST
CAME IN FROM THE WATERWAYS.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.598
I GOT IT. EASY-PEASY...

09:58.598 --> 10:00.701
(makes clicking sound)
GARY SINISE-Y.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.202
(mutters indistinctly)

10:02.202 --> 10:04.775
(alligator hisses)
OH, GOD! OH, GOD! OH, GOD!
OH, GOD! OH, GOD!

10:04.775 --> 10:08.178
HE'S GONE. (chuckles)

10:08.178 --> 10:10.380
YOU HAD A HOLE IN YOUR FENCE,
SO I BLOCKED IT WITH A ROCK.

10:10.380 --> 10:12.913
HE AIN'T COMIN' BACK.
HE'D BETTER NOT.

10:12.913 --> 10:15.185
(pops lips)
ANDY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

10:15.185 --> 10:17.688
HEY, LISTEN, I GOT THIS
FOR YOU OUT OF MY GIFT CLOSET.

10:17.688 --> 10:19.920
NOW IF YOU DON'T WANT IT,
YOU CAN TRADE IT IN

10:19.920 --> 10:21.992
FOR A ROCK
THAT SAYS "BELIEVE."

10:21.992 --> 10:23.994
IS THIS THREE FLAVORS
OF POPCORN?

10:23.994 --> 10:25.996
PLEASE DON'T HAVE
ONE OF THEM BE CHEDDAR.

10:25.996 --> 10:27.057
OKAY, IT'S ALL CHEDDAR.

10:27.057 --> 10:29.730
BUT IT'S STILL AWESOME.
THANK YOU.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.032
THANK YOU. OKAY, LISTEN,
SNEAK OUT THE SIDE

10:32.032 --> 10:34.835
SO GRAYSON DOESN'T SEE YOU.
(whispers) OKAY.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.737
(telephone rings)

10:36.737 --> 10:39.840
I FIGURED OUT WHERE I AM.
COME AND GET ME, PLEASE?

10:39.840 --> 10:41.171
OHH!

10:41.171 --> 10:42.943
(Grayson) WHERE WERE YOU?

10:42.943 --> 10:46.847
OH, UM, I WAS OUT, UH...

10:46.847 --> 10:48.849
GETTING JUICE.

10:48.849 --> 10:51.651
WRAP IT UP.
MY NECK'S ASLEEP.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.183
WHERE'D YOU GET THE JUICE?

10:53.183 --> 10:56.026
AT THE JUICE... STATION.

10:56.026 --> 10:57.327
IT'S NEW.

10:57.327 --> 10:59.830
Y-YOU PUMP THE JUICE YOURSELF

10:59.830 --> 11:01.792
OUT OF THESE OLD-TIMEY
GAS PUMP THINGS.

11:01.792 --> 11:04.664
IT'S--IT'S CUTE, GIMMICKY.
THAT BOTTLE'S EMPTY.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.396
WELL, I DRANK IT.

11:06.396 --> 11:09.239
DUH! THAT'S WHAT YOU DO
WHEN YOU GET JUICE.

11:09.239 --> 11:10.440
DER!

11:12.142 --> 11:14.444
OH, I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

11:14.444 --> 11:18.809
IT IS SO MUCH MORE FUN BEING
ALONE WHEN YOU'RE WITH SOMEONE.
I KNOW! WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

11:18.809 --> 11:21.151
IT'S SO GORGEOUS OUTSIDE,
PLUS MY SKIN'S LOOKING

11:21.151 --> 11:23.183
REALLY GOOD TODAY.
LET'S HAVE PEOPLE OVER.

11:23.183 --> 11:26.857
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO WIN YOUR BET.
I DO, AND I WANT
TO HAVE A BARBECUE.

11:26.857 --> 11:28.859
I WANT A LOT OF THINGS,
LAURIE.

11:28.859 --> 11:31.391
I WANT A CREDIT CARD
JUST FOR SHOES.

11:31.391 --> 11:34.224
I WANT THE JUICE STATION TO
ACTUALLY EXIST. I WANT IT ALL!

11:34.224 --> 11:36.867
YEAH, I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
HAVE USED THOSE ROMAN CANDLES

11:36.867 --> 11:38.829
TO GET THE GRILL GOIN'.

11:38.829 --> 11:41.201
WE'D BE Q'ING AT YOUR MOM'S
HOUSE IF SHE DIDN'T PUNT US.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.203
AND I THOUGHT WE WERE
GETTING ALONG GREAT LATELY,

11:43.203 --> 11:45.876
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN...
(blows raspberry)

11:45.876 --> 11:48.708
WELL, DAD,
I'LL ALWAYS BE HERE.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.140
I LOVE YOU.

11:50.140 --> 11:52.813
SWING AND A MISS, TRAV.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.344
SWING AND A MISS.

11:54.344 --> 11:56.216
(cell phone rings)

11:56.216 --> 11:57.988
(ring)
(clears throat)

11:57.988 --> 12:00.120
CAPTAIN SPEAKING.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.853
LISTEN, SNEAK OVER HERE
SO GRAYSON DOESN'T SEE YOU

12:02.853 --> 12:06.797
AND COME FIRE UP THE GRILL.
IT'S TOO LATE, J-BIRD. TRAV
AND I ALREADY GOT MEAT IN PLAY.

12:06.797 --> 12:09.429
OH, COME ON, BOBBY.
IT'S BARBECUE SATURDAY.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.962
SEE, I COULD NEVER MAKE
A MARINADE LIKE THAT.

12:11.962 --> 12:15.305
IT'S BEER AND PEPPER.
G.A.C.

12:15.305 --> 12:17.407
NOT SURE IT WORKS THERE,
SWEETIE.

12:17.407 --> 12:19.269
WHERE'S TRAVIS?

12:19.269 --> 12:24.374
LAURIE, I'M ROCKING
THE S.P.F. 90. YOU WANT IN?

12:24.374 --> 12:27.047
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?

12:27.047 --> 12:29.850
JULES GAVE IT TO ME
AS A THANK YOU.

12:29.850 --> 12:34.254
SHE LIKES TO THANK PEOPLE--
UNLIKE YOU, WHO NEVER THANKS ME.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.187
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU
CLEANING UP YOUR OWN WHISKERS.

12:37.187 --> 12:39.429
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO HITCH
YOUR WAGON TO THAT HORSE?

12:39.429 --> 12:43.233
YES. I'M TAKING A STAND,
AND THIS POPCORN IS A SYMBOL.

12:43.233 --> 12:46.466
OH, LOOK. MY FINGERS
ARE COVERED WITH GRATITUDE.

12:46.466 --> 12:49.039
(smacks lips)

12:49.039 --> 12:51.001
(rock music playing)

12:51.001 --> 12:53.003
(Tuffy barking)
COME ON, GUYS!

12:53.003 --> 12:55.145
(turns off music)
THERE'S 20 BUCKS
AT STAKE HERE.

12:55.145 --> 12:57.277
(lowers voice)
WHEN WE'RE OUTSIDE,

12:57.277 --> 12:59.279
WE NEED TO USE
OUR INSIDE VOICES.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.883
(whispers) CAN I TURN THE MUSIC
BACK ON IF I GIVE YOU 20 BUCKS?
(laughs)

13:02.883 --> 13:07.157
WELL, IT ALL DEPENDS, TRAVIS.
CAN YOU GIVE ME BACK MY PRIDE?
THAT SHIP HAS SAILED, MOM.

13:07.157 --> 13:10.160
SO DALE UN-BROKE UP WITH MISTY
BECAUSE HE GOT ON HER CELL PLAN,

13:10.160 --> 13:13.463
AND IT'S VERY COMPLICATED,
BUT WHAT SHOULD I DO?
SWEETIE, I LOVE YOU, BUT I'M
RETIRING FROM ALL DALE TALK.

13:13.463 --> 13:15.926
BUT, JULES--
UNH-UNH.

13:15.926 --> 13:17.567
(whispers)
SHE CAN BE SO COLD.

13:17.567 --> 13:19.199
HEY, JULES.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.902
(lowers voice)
SHH. IT'S A QUIET BARBECUE.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.934
(whispering) SORRY.
SO ELLIE'S NOT COMING

13:23.934 --> 13:26.436
BECAUSE SHE'S MAD THAT I WANT
HER TO THANK ME EVERY ONCE--
SWEETIE, WHATEVER IT IS,

13:26.436 --> 13:28.408
I HAVE TO BE ON HER SIDE.
YOU KNOW THAT.

13:28.408 --> 13:32.112
TOLD YOU, ANDY!
IT'S A QUIET BARBECUE.
DAMN IT!

13:32.112 --> 13:34.214
(boom)
WHOA!

13:34.214 --> 13:38.118
AN M-80 DROPPED OUT OF MY POCKET
AND INTO THE FIRE.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.190
CAN Y'ALL HEAR ME
TALKIN' RIGHT NOW?
(Tuffy barking)

13:40.190 --> 13:41.121
'CAUSE I CAN'T.

13:41.121 --> 13:44.824
в™Єв™Є

13:46.526 --> 13:50.560
SO DO YOU WANT TO, UH, PAY ME
WITH A CHECK OR WHAT? (chuckles)

13:57.567 --> 14:00.911
LOVE WINNING BETS. (gasps)
I FEEL THE URGE TO PLAY A SONG.

14:00.911 --> 14:02.172
FIGHT IT.

14:02.172 --> 14:04.174
(groans) I CAN'T.

14:04.174 --> 14:07.247
в™Є WELL в™Є

14:07.247 --> 14:09.119
WHAT RHYMES WITH...

14:09.119 --> 14:11.481
(falsetto voice)
в™Є WAH-WAH-WAH-WAH в™Є

14:11.481 --> 14:14.424
FINE. YOU GOT ME.
I LIKE TO BE AROUND PEOPLE.

14:14.424 --> 14:17.187
NOW LET'S GO OUT AND GET A BEER.
BOBBY WILL MAKE YOU A BURGER.

14:17.187 --> 14:21.031
I SHOULD GO.
YOU HAVE PLANS OR SOMETHING?

14:21.031 --> 14:22.592
UNH-UNH.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:22.592 --> 14:26.236
I AM INVITING YOU TO HANG OUT
WITH THE CUL-DE-SAC CREW.

14:26.236 --> 14:28.638
I LOVE THAT NAME YOU GAVE US.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

14:28.638 --> 14:31.942
LOOK, I KNOW YOU LOVE
YOUR SMUG, LONER IMAGE

14:31.942 --> 14:34.074
THAT YOU'VE CREATED
FOR YOURSELF.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.046
I GET IT.
BUT IT'S GETTING OLD.

14:36.046 --> 14:38.178
NOW LET'S GO OUTSIDE
AND CONNECT WITH PEOPLE.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.180
IT'LL BE SO GOOD FOR YOU.

14:40.180 --> 14:44.514
DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT
YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR ME?
OF COURSE I DO.

14:44.514 --> 14:49.159
в™Єв™Є

14:49.159 --> 14:51.621
BOBBY, WE GOTTA MAKE GRAYSON
COME BACK OVER.

14:51.621 --> 14:54.364
HUH?
ARE YOU STILL HAVING
HEARING ISSUES?

14:54.364 --> 14:57.968
HUH?
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA GET
ANDY TO GO WITH YOU.

14:57.968 --> 14:59.399
(Tuffy barking)

14:59.399 --> 15:01.471
DALE'S NOT PERFECT.

15:01.471 --> 15:03.473
I MEAN, IT'S NOT COOL

15:03.473 --> 15:06.176
THAT HE FORGES DAN MARINO'S
AUTOGRAPH FOR A LIVING.

15:06.176 --> 15:08.408
BUT I THINK HE REALLY CARES
ABOUT ME. DON'T YOU?

15:08.408 --> 15:10.140
THAT DEPENDS.

15:10.140 --> 15:13.243
DOES HE HAVE YOUR NAME
TATTOOED ANYWHERE ON HIS BODY?

15:13.243 --> 15:15.245
MM. WELL, HE SAYS HE DOES,

15:15.245 --> 15:17.517
BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO FIND IT YET.
MM.

15:17.517 --> 15:20.390
LOOK, I KNOW THAT WHATEVER YOU
AND ELLIE ARE FIGHTING ABOUT,

15:20.390 --> 15:22.392
IT MUST BE VERY IMPORTANT...

15:22.392 --> 15:26.356
POPCORN AND CHIN WHISKERS.
BUT DON'T LET IT RUIN
BARBECUE SATURDAY!

15:26.356 --> 15:30.330
AND LOOK, EVEN I CAN ADMIT
SOMETIMES ELLIE CAN BE

15:30.330 --> 15:34.264
A TEENY, TINY BIT...
(whispers) OF A BITCH.
HOW DARE YOU!

15:34.264 --> 15:36.306
THERE IS NO WAY
YOU HEARD THAT!

15:36.306 --> 15:39.609
I'VE BEEN TAUGHT
TO READ LIPS.

15:39.609 --> 15:42.272
(grunts) I ALWAYS FORGET
ABOUT HER DEAF BROTHER.

15:42.272 --> 15:44.174
SAM.

15:44.174 --> 15:46.977
COME ON, G-MAN,
SWING BY FOR A FEW BEERS.

15:46.977 --> 15:50.150
SORRY, FELLAS, NOT INTERESTED.
I'M WATCHING "RUDY."

15:50.150 --> 15:52.252
(both) "RUDY"?

15:54.484 --> 15:56.456
HMM.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.063
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

16:03.063 --> 16:04.634
(voice breaking)
WATCHING "RUDY."

16:04.634 --> 16:07.037
(voice breaking)
HE GOT IN THE GAME,

16:07.037 --> 16:10.040
AND HIS DAD'S THERE, AND HE'S
WATCHING AND HE'S ALL PROUD.

16:10.040 --> 16:12.402
(voice breaking)
GREATEST GUY MOVIE OF ALL TIME.

16:12.402 --> 16:14.204
YOU'RE NOT GETTING
THESE TWO BACK.

16:14.204 --> 16:16.976
HEY, GUYS, WHY DON'T YOU
COME BACK TO MY PLACE,

16:16.976 --> 16:19.579
AND WE'LL PUT ON "SHAWSHANK"?
(both) "SHAWSHANK"?

16:19.579 --> 16:21.281
I'VE GOT THAT DVD, TOO.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.313
YES, WELL,
OVER AT MY HOUSE,

16:23.313 --> 16:27.057
I'LL GIVE YOU THE FULL
"SHAWSHANK" EXPERIENCE.

16:27.057 --> 16:31.021
FULL "SHAWSHANK"?
WHAT'S FULL "SHAWSHANK"?

16:31.021 --> 16:36.296
(Jules) ANDY TORRES
CRAWLED THROUGH 500 YARDS...
(retches)

16:36.296 --> 16:38.698
OF MUCK TO REACH HIS FREEDOM.

16:38.698 --> 16:42.001
500 YARDS.

16:42.001 --> 16:45.004
(dramatic orchestral music
playing)

17:18.638 --> 17:22.272
WOW, ANDY.
I'M A LITTLE EMOTIONAL.

17:22.272 --> 17:26.316
I WISH ELLIE WAS HERE TO SEE
THAT. SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT.

17:26.316 --> 17:29.149
CAN YOU MAKE IT RAIN
ON ME SOME MORE?

17:29.149 --> 17:32.252
OF COURSE I CAN, SWEETIE.

17:36.826 --> 17:38.628
DING-DONG.

17:38.628 --> 17:41.091
PEOPLE NORMALLY KNOCK
ON THE OUTSIDE OF HOUSES.

17:41.091 --> 17:42.232
BEAT IT.

17:42.232 --> 17:44.234
ANDY'S OVER THERE MOPEY
AS A HOUND DOG.

17:44.234 --> 17:47.697
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
THROW HIM A BONE?
'CAUSE IT WON'T MEAN ANYTHING.

17:47.697 --> 17:50.670
IT'S LIKE WHEN JULES ACTS LIKE
SHE STILL NEEDS YOU TO GRILL

17:50.670 --> 17:55.405
SO YOU FEEL LIKE PART
OF THE FAMILY.
SO SHE REALLY DOESN'T
NEED ME TO COOK HOT DOGS?

17:55.405 --> 17:57.447
(chuckles) PLEASE, WOMAN.
I KNOW THAT.

17:57.447 --> 18:00.410
I'M GRATEFUL WHEN
SHE THROWS ME A BONE.

18:00.410 --> 18:03.113
YOU KNOW, SHE DOES IT
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

18:03.113 --> 18:05.485
YOU OUGHT TO TRY THAT
WITH ANDY.

18:05.485 --> 18:09.219
YOU NEED TO WARN ME WHEN YOU'RE
GONNA GIVE ME LIFE ADVICE

18:09.219 --> 18:12.562
SO I CAN GET MY NOTEBOOK OUT.
(chuckles) OH, REMEMBER
WE USED TO TALK LIKE THIS?

18:12.562 --> 18:16.226
I DO, ACTUALLY.
WHY'D YOU GO AND RUIN IT?

18:16.226 --> 18:19.299
WISH I HADN'T.

18:21.231 --> 18:24.874
ANYWAY, SORRY TO GET
IN YOUR FACE ABOUT ANDY.

18:24.874 --> 18:27.437
IF YOU THINK I LOVE
THAT LITTLE DUDE TOO MUCH,

18:27.437 --> 18:28.878
WELL...

18:28.878 --> 18:31.381
G.A.C., ELLIE.

18:31.381 --> 18:33.513
G.A.C. FOREVER.

18:39.389 --> 18:40.720
(creaks)

18:40.720 --> 18:42.252
JUST COME OVER.

18:42.252 --> 18:45.155
I WAS JUST ON MY WAY
TO BRING YOU THESE.

18:45.155 --> 18:46.426
SHUT UP!

18:46.426 --> 18:49.128
EVEN THOUGH I HATE DAISIES,
I FORGIVE YOU.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.631
THEY'RE NOT FROM ME.
THEY'RE FROM LARRY.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.633
STRANGE THAT
A BILLION-YEAR-OLD MAN

18:53.633 --> 18:57.467
WOULD GET YOUR ADDRESS WRONG.
THIS CARD IS
SHOCKINGLY FILTHY.

18:57.467 --> 18:59.639
WELL, UH, HAVE A GOOD ONE.

18:59.639 --> 19:02.672
YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE YOU
DON'T MIND BEING BY YOURSELF.

19:02.672 --> 19:04.274
I DON'T KNOW.

19:04.274 --> 19:06.376
BUT I BET YOU DON'T LIKE IT
AS MUCH AS YOU SAY YOU DO.

19:06.376 --> 19:08.718
BUT EITHER WAY, IT'S OVER.
YOU'RE A PART OF THIS CREW.

19:08.718 --> 19:12.322
YOU GOLF WITH BOBBY.
YOU'VE CRIED WITH ANDY,

19:12.322 --> 19:15.425
YOU KNOW LAURIE AND ELLIE--
WHO?

19:15.425 --> 19:17.927
BLONDE FRIEND AND MEAN FRIEND.
OH, YEAH, YEAH, THOSE TWO.

19:17.927 --> 19:20.890
NOW LISTEN. YOU'RE HOOKED IN.
WITH THIS GROUP, IT'S FOR LIFE.

19:20.890 --> 19:23.533
SO YOU CAN EITHER STAY HERE,
OR YOU CAN COME TO MY HOUSE

19:23.533 --> 19:26.236
AND EAT A BURGER
AND TALK TO SOME FRIENDS,

19:26.236 --> 19:28.398
MAYBE SEE AN ALLIGATOR.

19:28.398 --> 19:31.241
в™Є CONFIDENT
IN MY SEXUALITAY в™Є

19:31.241 --> 19:33.703
I'M STILL LOVING THAT.
(chuckles)

19:35.805 --> 19:38.448
AND DALE TOTALLY
FORGOT MY BIRTHDAY.
(bottle cap clatters)

19:38.448 --> 19:41.451
OKAY, WE DID GO PLAY PAINTBALL
A WEEK LATER,

19:41.451 --> 19:43.683
BUT HE GOT MAD BECAUSE
HE SAID I WAS FLIRTING

19:43.683 --> 19:46.286
WITH THE TEAM CAPTAIN,
WHICH I GUESS I KIND OF WAS.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.458
HE WAS A TOTAL CUTIE.

19:48.458 --> 19:51.891
BUT THEN DALE SHOT ME, LIKE,
FOUR TIMES IN THE BACK.
WHY ARE YOU WITH THIS GUY?
SERIOUSLY.

19:51.891 --> 19:54.394
HOW--HOW CAN A WOMAN WHO IS
SO GORGEOUS AND CONFIDENT

19:54.394 --> 19:57.196
AND WHO NEEDS, LIKE,
THREE COPS TO TAKE HER DOWN,

19:57.196 --> 19:59.629
BE WITH SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T
EVEN KNOW HER BIRTHDAY--

19:59.629 --> 20:02.632
JULY 18th... BY THE WAY.
YOU KNOW MY BIRTHDAY?

20:02.632 --> 20:06.276
YOU TOLD ME ONCE,
AND I LISTENED.

20:06.276 --> 20:08.478
YOU'RE WORTH LISTENING TO,
LAURIE.

20:08.478 --> 20:12.842
THANK YOU.

20:12.842 --> 20:14.744
SURE.

20:14.744 --> 20:16.986
KIDDO.

20:16.986 --> 20:19.289
I MADE YOU A PLATE.

20:21.491 --> 20:24.624
THANK YOU FOR PUTTING UP
WITH ME.

20:24.624 --> 20:28.758
OH, MY GOD, THAT'S A BIG THANKS
'CAUSE IT COVERS EVERYTHING.

20:28.758 --> 20:31.000
IT'S A BLANKET THANKS.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.704
DID YOU DO THAT?

20:34.704 --> 20:36.706
NAH, I'M NOT THAT SMART.

20:36.706 --> 20:38.738
(laughs) THAT'S WHAT I
WAS GONNA SAY.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.740
(gasps) GRAYSON!

20:40.740 --> 20:44.414
WELCOME TO BARBECUE SATURDAY!
EVERYBODY, LOOK!

20:44.414 --> 20:47.347
(chuckles) THANKS. I BROUGHT
A SIX-PACK AND SOME KETCHUP.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.449
IT'S ALL I HAD IN THE FRIDGE.

20:49.449 --> 20:52.282
G-LOVE,
LET ME GET YOU A BURGER.
I'LL GET HIM A BEER.

20:52.282 --> 20:54.384
THERE YOU GO.
(chuckles) THANKS.

20:54.384 --> 20:56.726
(speaking indistinctly)

20:56.726 --> 20:59.789
(Tuffy barking)

21:05.965 --> 21:08.738
TRAVIS IS PRETTY GREAT.
OH, HE IS.

21:08.738 --> 21:10.370
(Tuffy barking)
SERIOUSLY, TUFFY!

21:10.370 --> 21:14.273
YOU KNOW,
WHEN TRAVIS IS 25,

21:14.273 --> 21:17.046
I'LL ONLY BE 34.

21:17.046 --> 21:20.850
IF YOU EVER DATE HIM,
I WILL NOT LOVE YOU ANYMORE.

21:20.850 --> 21:23.413
NO, BECAUSE IF WE GET
MARRIED AND HAVE KIDS,

21:23.413 --> 21:25.355
THEY'LL BE
YOUR GRANDCHILDREN.

21:25.355 --> 21:27.657
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO LOVE ME.

21:27.657 --> 21:29.659
AH.

21:29.659 --> 21:32.362
ARE YOU SLEEPING OVER?
OKAY.

21:32.362 --> 21:36.466
(Tuffy squealing)
(man) OH, GOD, NO!
PUT TUFFY DOWN!

21:36.466 --> 21:38.468
SEE? I TOLD YOU
THERE WAS A GATOR.
