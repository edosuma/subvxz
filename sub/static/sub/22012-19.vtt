00:01.871 --> 00:02.959
ADULT ADAM:
For as long
as I can remember,

00:03.046 --> 00:05.005
Beverly Goldberg
loved to dance.

00:05.092 --> 00:07.485
Sure, her fearless mom moves
were embarrassing,

00:07.572 --> 00:10.010
but you had to admire
her pure passion.

00:10.097 --> 00:11.446
You can't blame the lady.

00:11.533 --> 00:12.969
This was the '80s,

00:13.056 --> 00:15.189
the golden age
of the cheesy dance movie,

00:15.276 --> 00:16.712
most notably,
Flashdance,

00:16.799 --> 00:18.279
the tale
of a working-class girl

00:18.366 --> 00:21.238
who wanted to boogie
with the best.

00:21.325 --> 00:23.284
I don't think
she's ever gonna get
into this dance school.

00:23.371 --> 00:25.199
Even the lady judge
isn't supporting her.

00:25.286 --> 00:26.722
This movie is insane.

00:26.809 --> 00:28.680
She's so graceful
and yet from Pittsburgh?

00:28.767 --> 00:30.204
Shh!
Screw you!

00:30.291 --> 00:32.075
Some people!
Jerk!

00:32.162 --> 00:34.077
ADULT ADAM: But,
as fate would have it,
that year,

00:34.164 --> 00:36.514
flashdancing made its way
to Jenkintown.

00:36.601 --> 00:38.734
Break out your hottest
leg warmers, ladies!

00:38.821 --> 00:40.475
It's time to flashdance.

00:40.562 --> 00:43.869
"Bring your boogie-woogie
and a towel"? Ehh.

00:43.956 --> 00:47.047
Come on.
It's our chance to live
the very realistic story

00:47.134 --> 00:49.179
of a steelworker
turned modern dancer.

00:49.266 --> 00:52.008
Please! No one wants to
see four moms

00:52.095 --> 00:54.532
shake their tushes
at the JCC.

00:54.619 --> 00:56.447
Our entire lives revolve
around our kids.

00:56.534 --> 00:58.406
But I have learned
something very important

00:58.493 --> 00:59.537
from the Bevolution.

00:59.624 --> 01:02.062
Is that still a thing?
The biggest.

01:02.149 --> 01:05.587
And it's taught me that unless
we make time for ourselves,

01:05.674 --> 01:07.676
our wonderful families
will leech us dry

01:07.763 --> 01:09.417
of our youth and spirit.

01:09.504 --> 01:11.767
I guess I do have
a little time
between school drop off

01:11.854 --> 01:13.899
and school pick up, and sports
drop off and sports pick up.

01:13.986 --> 01:15.901
Well, it sounds like a small
window, but I'll take it.

01:15.988 --> 01:17.729
How about you gals?
Maybe it wouldn't hurt

01:17.816 --> 01:20.471
to stay in the back
of the class
and pick up a few moves.

01:20.558 --> 01:22.734
ADULT ADAM:
While they didn't stay
in the back of the class,

01:22.821 --> 01:24.780
they did pick up
a few moves...

01:24.867 --> 01:28.044
Or whatever this is.

01:30.742 --> 01:32.004
INSTRUCTOR: And pose!

It was April 11,

a typical Saturday night

02:30.759 --> 02:32.848

Emmy Mirsky.

02:32.935 --> 02:35.242
God, I love Blades of Steel.I call Penguins!

02:35.329 --> 02:37.069
Why do you always
choose the stupid Penguins?

Ever since we were kids,
we did everything together,

02:48.342 --> 02:51.345
from Nintendo marathons to treehouse slumber parties.

02:51.432 --> 02:53.477
Brian McMahon made it

03:13.541 --> 03:16.239
Do not be fooled by its
comically delightful name.

03:16.326 --> 03:18.285
Pickleball

08:35.123 --> 08:36.472
Muscles Mirsky!

08:36.559 --> 08:39.040
What if I told you there's
three eligible bachelors

08:39.127 --> 08:40.868
just waiting to become
your boyfriend?

08:40.955 --> 08:44.088
Mr. Goldberg,
this is study hall,
not The Dating Game.

08:44.175 --> 08:45.873
This'll only take a minute.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.657
Let's meet
bachelor number one!

08:47.744 --> 08:50.660
He's exotic.
He's mysterious.
He's Sergei!

08:50.747 --> 08:52.749
Good hello, sturdy woman.

08:52.836 --> 08:54.969
This joker?
You can't be serious.

08:55.056 --> 08:57.406
Sergei still happy
he got out there.

08:57.493 --> 08:58.973
Okay, rough start.

08:59.060 --> 09:00.888
Bachelor number two
is a tall glass of water

09:00.975 --> 09:02.585
who plays clarinet
in marching band...

09:02.672 --> 09:04.761
It's me, Dan!
I couldn't wait for him
to finish speaking!

09:04.848 --> 09:07.808
Keep walkin', Dan-O.
Thank you for
the opportunity to compete.

09:07.895 --> 09:09.461
Saving the best for last!
Bachelor number three!

09:09.549 --> 09:10.550
It better not be
Dave Kim.

09:10.637 --> 09:13.291
What? I would never!

09:13.378 --> 09:16.512
Look, I appreciate
the crappy effort.

09:16.599 --> 09:19.123
But... I kinda spent lunch
making out
with Brian McMahon.

09:19.210 --> 09:20.951
What do you even see
in that guy?

09:21.038 --> 09:23.911
He's handsome
and athletic and cool.

09:23.998 --> 09:25.826
Name one cool guy
who doesn't talk.

09:25.913 --> 09:27.262
Snake Eyes
from G.I. Joe.

09:27.349 --> 09:28.437
Name one more.
Teller from Penn
and Teller.

09:28.524 --> 09:29.786
Name another.
Snoopy.

09:29.873 --> 09:31.788
He's the best.
Oddjob from James Bond,

09:31.875 --> 09:33.398
Jason Voorhees
and Michael Myers.

09:33.485 --> 09:35.357
All right, stop dancing
in the end zone!

09:35.444 --> 09:38.752
I couldn't wait any longer!
Have you chosen your suitor?

09:38.839 --> 09:40.971
ADULT ADAM:
While my matchmaking
blew up in my face,

09:41.058 --> 09:43.234
my mom was
about to drop a bomb.

09:43.321 --> 09:45.541
Bev, where are your dance
clothes and your leg warmers?

09:45.628 --> 09:46.803
Class is about to start.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.588
These legs
will never be warmed again.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.590
Why are you talking
so dramatically
about dance wear?

09:50.677 --> 09:52.592
I shared my gift of dance
with my family.

09:52.679 --> 09:54.681
And they laughed.

09:54.768 --> 09:58.032
So much so that Murray cracked
a bone in his middle body.

09:58.119 --> 09:59.381
Don't listen
to your family!

09:59.468 --> 10:00.817
Mine said we're
gonna be awesome!

10:00.904 --> 10:02.079
Same here.
Mine, too.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.429
That's 'cause they're kind,
stupid liars.

10:04.516 --> 10:06.823
I mean, no offense,
but anyone
who's seen Linda dance

10:06.910 --> 10:08.782
knows she's got no boogie
from the waist down.

10:08.869 --> 10:11.001
Excuse me?
Admit it,

10:11.088 --> 10:12.829
you jacked up your back

10:12.916 --> 10:14.831
carrying around your kid
for far too long.

10:14.918 --> 10:17.965
Geoff's 11-year-old legs
got tired easily.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.836
And don't get me started
on Essie's jazz hands.

10:19.923 --> 10:21.751
What's wrong
with my jazz hands?They are crooked

10:21.838 --> 10:25.755
and calloused
from years of scrubbing greasy
pans and wiping tushies.

10:25.842 --> 10:28.105
I was gonna cover them
with sparkly gloves
for the show.

10:28.192 --> 10:29.672
And, Ginzy, all those years
of stress

10:29.759 --> 10:31.631
raising four rowdy boys

10:31.718 --> 10:34.285
has given you
such a nervous mom-tummy

10:34.372 --> 10:36.592
that you make poots
all through this class.

10:36.679 --> 10:37.724
You know about my poots?

10:37.811 --> 10:39.160
Yes.
So intense.

10:39.247 --> 10:42.119
You know, truth is,
I'm still worse off than you.

10:42.206 --> 10:46.254
My family told me
I'll never be anything
but a lame-butt mom.

10:46.341 --> 10:48.386
No use fighting it.

10:48.473 --> 10:50.475

10:50.562 --> 10:52.477

ADULT ADAM:
I was losing Emmy
to the cool kids,

11:00.181 --> 11:01.922
so I turned to
the coolest dude I knew.

11:02.009 --> 11:04.228
Pops! Stop it
with the hamantaschen!

11:04.315 --> 11:05.621
I have an emergency!

11:05.708 --> 11:08.406
I was so close, but fine.
What do you got?

11:08.493 --> 11:11.192
Emmy has a super-popular
boyfriend!Good for her.

11:11.279 --> 11:13.237
No! She's gonna leave me
in the dust,

11:13.324 --> 11:16.023
which means I gotta
become super cool super fast.

11:16.110 --> 11:18.199
You want
cool lessons, huh?

11:18.286 --> 11:19.635
Well, you've come
to the right place.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.289
I don't have time
to learn stuff!

11:21.376 --> 11:23.944
I need an expensive shortcut
and I need it now!

11:24.031 --> 11:26.990
ADULT ADAM: It was red, it was leather, it was in the "Beat It" video.

11:27.077 --> 11:28.949
He who wore it
was a god amongst men.

11:29.036 --> 11:30.994
It's a fact.
Anyone who wears this jacket

11:31.081 --> 11:33.475
is automatically
the coolest badass
in the room.

11:33.562 --> 11:34.519
'Cause of
all the zippers?

11:34.606 --> 11:36.260
'Cause of MJ.

11:36.347 --> 11:39.524
And no kid on earth has one
'cause it costs $463.

11:39.611 --> 11:43.920
Whoa! You don't need this
farkaktespaceman jacket.

11:44.007 --> 11:45.705
Fine. I'm just gonna
call Emmy

11:45.792 --> 11:47.532
and tell her Shy Bri
is no good for her.

11:47.619 --> 11:51.449
No, that is
the least cool thing to do.

11:51.536 --> 11:54.452
Hello?
Hi, Mrs. Mirsky, it's Adam.
Is Emmy there?

11:54.539 --> 11:57.151
No. She said
she was studying
with you tonight.

11:57.238 --> 11:59.806
Emmy used me
as her nerd cover story.

11:59.893 --> 12:02.460
Oh, no! How sad for you
but smart of her.

12:02.547 --> 12:04.680
She's not there, is she?

12:04.767 --> 12:06.769
Of course!
I just forgot!

12:06.856 --> 12:09.685
She's making popcorn
in the popcorn room.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.643
Uh-huh.
Can I talk to her?

12:11.731 --> 12:13.167
Of course you can.

12:13.254 --> 12:15.778
Hey, Emmy!
Your mom's on the phone!

12:15.865 --> 12:17.649
Here she comes.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.000
She's walking to the phone
with the popcorn in her hand.

12:20.087 --> 12:22.654
Oh, no, she just
tripped and fell!

12:22.742 --> 12:25.092
Ohh, the popcorn
is everywhere!

12:25.179 --> 12:27.616
Oh! Oh!
Now, I just fell!
Gotta go!

12:27.703 --> 12:28.965
She has nev...

12:31.054 --> 12:33.404
I'm gonna buy you
the red jacket.

12:33.491 --> 12:35.711
ADULT ADAM: Once again,
Pops bailed me out.

12:35.798 --> 12:38.322
And thanks to the ridicule,
my mom bailed on dancing.

12:38.409 --> 12:41.108
Baby, I love you! You make
everything so much better!

12:41.195 --> 12:42.936
You shamed your mom
into quitting,

12:43.023 --> 12:44.764
who shamed my mom
into quitting, and then
everyone else quit

12:44.851 --> 12:45.808
and now the whole thing's
canceled.

12:45.895 --> 12:47.201
Well, you're welcome,
handsome.

12:47.288 --> 12:49.377
Wait. Bevy and all her friends
quit that thing?

12:49.464 --> 12:50.813
Thanks to your amazing
and cruel daughter.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.946
I was awful, too.

12:53.033 --> 12:54.512
BEVERLY: Dinner's served.

12:54.599 --> 12:56.819
If you need me,
I'll be upstairs in bed

12:56.906 --> 12:58.995
staring at the ceiling,
thinking about
what could've been.

12:59.082 --> 13:01.171
Cool.

13:01.258 --> 13:03.260
Um, what's the deal
with this sad lasagna?

13:03.347 --> 13:05.045
Mom's never made anything
in a casserole dish

13:05.132 --> 13:07.134
with less than eight layers.
What's going on?

13:07.221 --> 13:10.398
Clearly you morons
hurt the lady
and you're gonna apologize.

13:10.485 --> 13:12.269

keyboard songs

13:12.356 --> 13:14.358

and jump around.

13:14.445 --> 13:15.925
You know, the annoying crap
you do every week.

13:16.012 --> 13:18.319
Why just us?
You were laughing, too.

13:18.406 --> 13:21.409
Please, I'm her husband.
I never have to say I'm sorry.

13:21.496 --> 13:22.889
That's how marriage works.

13:22.976 --> 13:24.847
Okay, I'll get my Casio.

13:24.934 --> 13:26.544
And I'll get
my crazy mad flow.

ADULT ADAM:
As they strolled off
to make amends,

13:30.200 --> 13:32.550
I was desperately hoping
my new red jacket
would make me cool.

13:32.637 --> 13:34.857
Hey! Beat it!

13:34.944 --> 13:37.251
Oh, yeah, sorry, right.
I'll get out of here.

13:37.338 --> 13:40.080
Nah, bro. Your jacket.
It's from "Beat It."

look, he's got the jacket!

13:42.909 --> 13:44.867

Okay, cool, man.
I'll catch you later.

14:01.188 --> 14:02.624
Adam?

14:02.711 --> 14:06.062

ditched me to hang here.

that guy?

14:07.411 --> 14:08.848

14:08.935 --> 14:10.850
Are you kidding me?
I finally find someone I like

14:10.937 --> 14:12.286
and you can't even
be happy for me?

14:12.373 --> 14:14.331
Happy?
We're best friends!

14:14.418 --> 14:16.333
It's supposed to be
just you and me!

next door to each other

shoved into the background

on the weekends, huh?

everyone around him laugh.
