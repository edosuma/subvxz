WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:03.674
(horn honks, tires screech)

00:03.674 --> 00:06.577
A TRAGIC EVENT...

00:06.577 --> 00:09.009
LED TO THE END OF A MARRIAGE...

00:09.009 --> 00:11.542
HE'S DATING A FRIEND
OF MINE.

00:11.542 --> 00:14.115
AND THE COMPLICATIONS
OF MOVING ON.

00:14.115 --> 00:16.487
MEDICAL WONDERS OCCURRED...

00:16.487 --> 00:19.550
IF WE REMOVE THAT BONE FRAGMENT,
YOU COULD REGAIN YOUR SIGHT.

00:19.550 --> 00:21.452
BOTH LARGE AND SMALL.
 (gasps)

00:21.452 --> 00:24.024
MY HUSBAND HAS AGREED TO
THE PROCEDURE YOU SUGGESTED.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.327
OH, THE ONE TO ALLEVIATE
HIS SNORING?
 DETECTIVES...

00:26.327 --> 00:31.062
AND A DEVASTATING LIE
WAS TOLD.
 THE NIGHT OF THE FIRE,
I SAW SOMEBODY COME OUT.

00:31.062 --> 00:33.104
HIS NAME IS PORTER SCAVO.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.512
(Mary Alice) ONE MORNING,
IT OCCURRED TO LYNETTE SCAVO

00:41.512 --> 00:42.813
SHE COULD NOT REMEMBER

00:42.813 --> 00:48.279
THE LAST TIME HER FAMILY
HAD BREAKFAST TOGETHER.

00:48.279 --> 00:50.651
SO LYNETTE DID

00:50.651 --> 00:53.454
WHAT ANY MOTHER WOULD DO

00:53.454 --> 00:55.826
IN THAT SITUATION...

00:55.826 --> 00:58.289
SEE YA LATER, MOM.

00:58.289 --> 01:01.832
THE FIRST PERSON WHO STEPS FOOT
OUT THAT DOOR WILL LOSE A LEG.

01:01.832 --> 01:07.168
SHE THREATENED HER FAMILY
WITH VIOLENCE.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.677
THAT WAS DELICIOUS.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.610
BUT I DID PROMISE CHRISSY
I'D WALK HER TO SCHOOL TODAY.

01:19.610 --> 01:22.553
OH, YOU ARE SUCH A GENTLEMAN.
SIT YOUR ASS DOWN.

01:22.553 --> 01:25.556
DAD, MAKE MOM LET ME GO.

01:25.556 --> 01:28.559
EVERYONE AT THIS TABLE
WHO THINKS I HAVE THE POWER

01:28.559 --> 01:31.562
TO MAKE YOUR MOM DO ANYTHING,
RAISE YOUR HAND.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.399
WISH I COULD HAVE HELPED.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.733
LOOK, THIS FAMILY HAS BEEN
THROUGH A LOT LATELY,

01:42.733 --> 01:45.736
AND YOUR DAD AND I FEEL
WE'LL BE BETTER PARENTS

01:45.736 --> 01:49.140
IF WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
IN YOUR LIVES.
 (doorbell rings)

01:49.140 --> 01:52.543
SO, PARKER, HOW'S THAT SCIENCE
PROJECT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON?

01:52.543 --> 01:55.146
HEY. CAN I HELP YOU?

01:55.146 --> 01:58.149
IS THIS THE RESIDENCE
OF PORTER SCAVO?

01:58.149 --> 02:00.151
YEAH. WHY?
 I'M PORTER SCAVO.

02:00.151 --> 02:02.723
SIR, CAN YOU STEP OUTSIDE?
CAN YOU STEP OUTSIDE?

02:02.723 --> 02:05.196
PORTER SCAVO,
YOU ARE UNDER ARREST.
 (Tom) WHAT?

02:05.196 --> 02:08.199
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.
 WAIT. WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:08.199 --> 02:12.503
MA'AM, I'M GONNA HAVE
TO ASK YOU TO STEP BACK.
 OKAY, GUYS. LOOK, IF THIS IS
ABOUT WARREN SCHILLING'S BAR,

02:12.503 --> 02:15.606
PORTER HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THAT FIRE.
 APPARENTLY, THERE'S A WITNESS
THAT SAYS OTHERWISE.

02:15.606 --> 02:18.609
A WITNESS? I--
 NOW WILL YOU PLEASE STEP BACK
AND LET US DO OUR JOB?

02:18.609 --> 02:20.741
IF YOU GIVE UP THAT RIGHT,

02:20.741 --> 02:22.773
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN
AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU.

02:22.773 --> 02:24.775
A WITNESS?
WHAT ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT?

02:24.775 --> 02:27.578
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
WE'LL CALL A LAWYER.

02:27.578 --> 02:29.620
WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS.

02:29.620 --> 02:32.423
(car doors close,
engine starts)

02:40.561 --> 02:43.694
LYNETTE SCAVO COULDN'T REMEMBER

02:43.694 --> 02:47.638
THE LAST TIME HER FAMILY
HAD BREAKFAST TOGETHER...

02:47.638 --> 02:50.671
I GUESS WE'RE DONE TALKING ABOUT
MY SCIENCE PROJECT, HUH?

02:50.671 --> 02:53.674
YES, SWEETIE, WE ARE.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.806
AND SHE COULDN'T KNOW

02:55.806 --> 02:57.808
IT WOULD BE MANY YEARS

02:57.808 --> 03:02.213
BEFORE HER FAMILY WOULD HAVE
BREAKFAST TOGETHER AGAIN.

03:13.724 --> 03:16.597
IT'S AN AWFUL THING
TO LIVE IN THE DARK,

03:16.597 --> 03:20.731
UNABLE TO SEE
WHAT OTHERS TAKE FOR GRANTED.

03:20.731 --> 03:23.774
BUT SOMETIMES FOR A LUCKY FEW,

03:23.774 --> 03:26.977
A FLICKER OF LIGHT
PIERCES THAT DARKNESS

03:26.977 --> 03:32.243
AND BRINGS WITH IT THE PROMISE
OF BETTER DAYS TO COME.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.916
(Dr. Daniels)
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING?

03:35.916 --> 03:38.989
I SEE LIGHT...

03:38.989 --> 03:41.252
AND SOME FUZZY SHAPES.

03:41.252 --> 03:43.324
THAT'S IT?

03:43.324 --> 03:45.926
THAT'S ALL HE CAN
EXPECT TO SEE RIGHT NOW,

03:45.926 --> 03:48.899
BUT IF HE'S ABLE TO SEE
THAT MUCH,

03:48.899 --> 03:52.733
IT WON'T BE LONG
TILL HIS FULL SIGHT RETURNS.
 CAN YOU SEE ME, BABE?

03:52.733 --> 03:55.736
JUST YOUR SILHOUETTE. I CAN TELL
YOU CUT YOUR HAIR SHORT.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.969
IT KINDA MAKES YOUR EARS
STICK OUT, BUT I LIKE IT.

03:58.969 --> 04:01.812
CARLOS, THAT'S THE DOCTOR.
I'M RIGHT HERE.

04:01.812 --> 04:03.314
(laughs) IT DOESN'T MATTER.

04:03.314 --> 04:05.916
I CAN SEE SOMETHING
OTHER THAN NOTHING.

04:05.916 --> 04:08.279
OH, THIS IS A GOOD DAY.
 OH.

04:08.279 --> 04:09.780
NOW REMEMBER,

04:09.780 --> 04:13.284
HIS EYES WILL BE VERY SENSITIVE
FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS,

04:13.284 --> 04:16.255
SO LOW LIGHT INDOORS,
DARK GLASSES OUTSIDE--

04:16.255 --> 04:18.257
UH, DOCTOR,
WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL,

04:18.257 --> 04:20.491
SO DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY, BUT...

04:20.491 --> 04:22.993
(moaning)

04:26.537 --> 04:27.998
(switch clicks,
electricity humming)

04:27.998 --> 04:31.001
WELL, YOUR SEPTUM LOOKS GREAT,
AND YOU SAY YOUR SNORING'S GONE.

04:31.001 --> 04:33.344
I THINK WE'RE IN GOOD SHAPE.
 (telephone ringing)

04:33.344 --> 04:36.747
WILL WE NEED TO COME IN
FOR A FOLLOW-UP?
 NO. I THINK WE'RE DONE.

04:36.747 --> 04:39.750
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS TELL
MY PATIENTS I'M GONNA MISS THEM,

04:39.750 --> 04:44.014
BUT THIS TIME,
I REALLY MEAN IT.
 OH, WE FEEL THE SAME WAY
ABOUT YOU. YOU'VE BEEN LOVELY.

04:44.014 --> 04:47.057
(pager beeps)
 AH. PLEASE EXCUSE ME.

04:47.057 --> 04:49.490
MM.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.462
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:51.462 --> 04:53.494
LEAVING THE MAN
A THANK-YOU CARD.

04:53.494 --> 04:54.965
FOR A DOCTOR?

04:54.965 --> 04:57.468
HE HELPED YOU THROUGH
A VERY DIFFICULT TIME.

04:57.468 --> 05:01.532
THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS LET HIM
KNOW HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE...

05:01.532 --> 05:03.534
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

05:07.608 --> 05:08.909
(Andrew sighs)

05:08.909 --> 05:12.042
YOU'RE LIVING WITH THE MAN?
SINCE WHEN?

05:12.042 --> 05:15.015
UM, ALEX MOVED IN
SIX MONTHS AGO.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.588
WHY THE SECRECY?
DID YOU THINK I'D DISAPPROVE?

05:17.588 --> 05:19.590
THE MAN'S A DOCTOR,
FOR HEAVEN SAKES.

05:19.590 --> 05:21.592
YOU'VE DONE BETTER
THAN I DID.

05:21.592 --> 05:24.595
THAT WAS
A BIT OF A DRIVE-BY.
 I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

05:24.595 --> 05:27.628
HOW MY SON COULD KEEP A SECRET
LIKE THIS FROM HIS OWN MOTHER.

05:27.628 --> 05:30.631
MOM, UH, COME ON.
I MEAN, SINCE I CAME OUT,

05:30.631 --> 05:33.634
YOU HAVEN'T SHOWN THE SLIGHTEST
INTEREST IN MY LOVE LIFE.

05:33.634 --> 05:36.967
OF COURSE I HAVE.
 HANDING ME A PAMPHLET
ON THE RESURGENCE OF GONORRHEA?

05:36.967 --> 05:38.969
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

05:38.969 --> 05:41.071
THINK ABOUT IT.

05:41.071 --> 05:44.114
HAVE YOU EVEN ONCE ASKED
IF I WAS DATING SOMEONE?

05:44.114 --> 05:45.846
WELL...

05:45.846 --> 05:48.018
YOU SEE? YOU DIDN'T REALLY
WANT TO KNOW.

05:48.018 --> 05:51.622
THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T TELL YOU.

05:51.622 --> 05:54.625
WELL, I WANT TO KNOW NOW,
SO THAT'S WHY I'M HAVING

05:54.625 --> 05:56.887
YOU AND ALEX OVER TO DINNER
TOMORROW NIGHT.

05:56.887 --> 05:59.890
WHAT?
 YES. IF HE'S A PART OF YOUR
LIFE, I WANT TO GET TO KNOW HIM.

05:59.890 --> 06:01.732
I THINK I'LL SERVE FISH.

06:01.732 --> 06:04.735
ACTUALLY, I SAID IT WRONG.
UM, I-I THINK IT'S KIND OF COOL

06:04.735 --> 06:06.867
THE WAY THAT YOU IGNORE
MY LOVE LIFE.

06:06.867 --> 06:10.901
NICE TRY.
TELL ALEX WE DRESS FOR DINNER.
 MOM, PLEASE DON'T.

06:10.901 --> 06:12.903
ANDREW, YOU CAN'T CRITICIZE
MY PARENTING

06:12.903 --> 06:16.477
AND THEN DENY ME THE CHANCE
TO MAKE UP FOR IT.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.749
ORSON AND I WILL EXPECT YOU
AT 8:00.

06:20.681 --> 06:23.414
OKAY.

06:23.414 --> 06:26.417
(door opens and shuts)
 ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT ME THERE, TOO?

06:26.417 --> 06:28.419
I MEAN, AFTER ALL,
I'M ONLY A DENTIST.

06:28.419 --> 06:31.061
OH, FOR GOD SAKES, ORSON.
LET IT GO.

06:31.061 --> 06:34.495
M.J., HURRY UP.
YOUR DAD'S HERE.

06:38.429 --> 06:41.031
HEY, KATHERINE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

06:41.031 --> 06:43.003
WELL, I'M A BIG ZOO FAN,

06:43.003 --> 06:45.906
AND WHEN MIKE SAID
HE WAS TAKING M.J.,

06:45.906 --> 06:48.539
I ASKED IF I COULD TAG ALONG.
 SO IS THAT OKAY?

06:48.539 --> 06:50.681
OF COURSE.
WHY WOULDN'T IT BE OKAY?

06:50.681 --> 06:52.983
I THINK IT'S...

06:52.983 --> 06:54.915
GREAT.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.090
REALLY, REALLY GREAT.

07:03.494 --> 07:05.756
SWEETIE, GOOD NEWS.

07:05.756 --> 07:07.798
KATHERINE'S GONNA GO
TO THE ZOO WITH YOU.

07:07.798 --> 07:10.100
WHY DOES SHE HAVE TO GO?

07:10.100 --> 07:12.062
UH...

07:12.062 --> 07:15.666
WELL, SHE AND YOUR DADDY
ARE FRIENDS,

07:15.666 --> 07:19.039
AND THE MORE, THE MERRIER.
 I JUST WANT DADDY.

07:19.039 --> 07:22.212
OH, YOU GOT ME, PAL. HEY, WE'RE
ALL GONNA HAVE A GREAT TIME,

07:22.212 --> 07:23.914
AND WE'LL SHOW KATHERINE

07:23.914 --> 07:27.117
THAT FUNNY SWING
THE MONKEY GOES ON.

07:27.117 --> 07:30.050
OH, THAT SOUNDS SO COOL.
WILL YOU SHOW ME THAT?

07:31.822 --> 07:34.084
I GUESS.

07:34.084 --> 07:35.726
OKAY. LET'S GO.

07:35.726 --> 07:38.489
OH, DON'T FORGET HIS COAT.

07:40.130 --> 07:43.133
I'LL FIND SOME WAY
TO GET HIM TO LIKE ME.

07:43.133 --> 07:46.066
I'M SURE YOU WILL.

07:46.066 --> 07:49.600
BOY, I'LL BET THE GIFT SHOP
AT THE ZOO JUST LOVES DIVORCE.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.071
(chuckles nervously)

07:55.245 --> 07:58.879
(door buzzes)

07:58.879 --> 08:01.682
SO... HOW YOU DOING, SON?

08:01.682 --> 08:02.983
NOT SO GOOD.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.185
OKAY, WELL, DON'T WORRY.

08:05.185 --> 08:09.159
BOB HERE HAS AGREED
TO REPRESENT YOU.
 AND WHEN WE'RE DONE HERE,
I'M GOING TO GO TO THE D.A.

08:09.159 --> 08:11.722
AND WE'RE GOING
TO START TALKING ABOUT BAIL.

08:11.722 --> 08:14.024
BUT FIRST, I GOTTA ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS.

08:14.024 --> 08:17.027
LIKE WHY DO THE POLICE
HAVE A WITNESS?
 LYNETTE.

08:17.027 --> 08:20.030
THE D.A. SAYS YOU WERE SPOTTED
COMING OUT OF THE STORAGE ROOM

08:20.030 --> 08:22.903
RIGHT BEFORE THE FIRE STARTED.
WHAT GIVES?

08:22.903 --> 08:25.936
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
TALKING ABOUT. I HAVE AN ALIBI.

08:25.936 --> 08:27.938
OH.
 YOU DO? G-GREAT. GREAT.

08:27.938 --> 08:30.811
WHOA. WHY HAVEN'T YOU
TOLD ANYONE THIS?

08:30.811 --> 08:32.982
IT'S JUST...
(sighs) SO EMBARRASSING.

08:32.982 --> 08:34.985
YOU ARE UP FOR MANSLAUGHTER,

08:34.985 --> 08:37.918
AND YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT
BEING EMBARRASSED?

08:37.918 --> 08:39.519
IF WE CAN VERIFY YOUR STORY,

08:39.519 --> 08:41.922
I CAN PROBABLY
GET THE CHARGES DROPPED.

08:41.922 --> 08:45.155
WE WOULDN'T EVEN NEED BAIL.
SO WHERE WERE YOU?
 I WAS AT EDIE BRITT'S.

08:46.857 --> 08:48.298
OH, PLEASE.

08:48.298 --> 08:51.762
TELL ME YOU'RE NOT HAVING SEX
WITH HER, TOO.

08:51.762 --> 08:53.904
DAD.
 (hits table)

08:53.904 --> 08:56.206
WHAT IS WRONG WITH GIRLS
YOUR OWN AGE?

08:56.206 --> 08:59.870
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD GIVE
TO DATE A 17-YEAR-OLD?

08:59.870 --> 09:02.573
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT
THAT LATER.

09:02.573 --> 09:04.845
YOU WERE SAYING?
 I'M NOT HAVING SEX WITH EDIE.

09:04.845 --> 09:07.147
AFTER I LEFT THE CLUB,
I WENT TO HER HOUSE,

09:07.147 --> 09:10.821
BUT ONLY SO I COULD BREAK IN
AND STEAL HER GUN.

09:10.821 --> 09:14.685
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

09:14.685 --> 09:17.628
MR. SCHILLING BEAT UP ANNE
AND THEN HUMILIATED ME.

09:17.628 --> 09:20.761
I WANTED TO S-SCARE
THE HELL OUT OF HIM

09:20.761 --> 09:23.664
JUST TO WIPE THAT SMUG LOOK
OFF HIS FACE.

09:23.664 --> 09:26.336
BUT WHEN I GOT BACK TO THE CLUB,
IT WAS ON FIRE,

09:26.336 --> 09:28.238
SO I WENT HOME

09:28.238 --> 09:32.002
AND HID THE GUN
IN MOM'S FLOUR JAR.

09:32.002 --> 09:34.044
ANYWAY, THAT'S MY ALIBI.

09:36.006 --> 09:38.078
THINK THAT'LL HELP?

09:41.011 --> 09:43.113
DID ANYONE SEE YOU
DO THIS?

09:43.113 --> 09:44.254
NO.

09:44.254 --> 09:48.318
THEN THIS IS
REALLY NOT AN ALIBI.

09:48.318 --> 09:52.693
IT'S MORE A CONFESSION
TO ANOTHER CRIME.

09:52.693 --> 09:56.126
OH.

09:56.126 --> 09:58.268
WELL, YOU MISSED IT.

09:58.268 --> 09:59.970
MISSED WHAT?

09:59.970 --> 10:04.334
PORTER SCAVO GOT ARRESTED TODAY.
I KNEW HE SET THAT FIRE.

10:04.334 --> 10:06.777
POOR LYNETTE.
 "POOR LYNETTE," MY ASS.

10:06.777 --> 10:10.140
POOR SEVEN PEOPLE
WHO GOT BURNED TO DEATH.

10:10.140 --> 10:11.742
BOY.

10:11.742 --> 10:14.685
(voice echoing) I WOULDN'T WANNA
BE IN LYNETTE'S SHOES RIGHT NOW.

10:14.685 --> 10:16.647
CAN YOU IMAGINE
WHAT SHE'S GOING THROUGH?

10:16.647 --> 10:19.149
I MEAN, HE IS HER SON,

10:19.149 --> 10:21.952
SO SHE'S KIND OF
RESPONSIBLE.

10:21.952 --> 10:26.997
GOD, THE GUILT
SHE MUST BE FEELING.

10:26.997 --> 10:29.229
(pants)
 (gasps)

10:29.229 --> 10:32.132
DAVE, WHAT THE HELL?

10:32.132 --> 10:34.705
YOU-YOU'RE BLEEDING.

10:34.705 --> 10:36.336
OH.

10:36.336 --> 10:39.970
OKAY, COME ON. IN THE HOUSE.
LET'S GET THIS CLEANED UP.

10:39.970 --> 10:41.371
COME HERE.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.145
OH.

10:58.929 --> 11:01.862
YOU'RE JUST GONNA SNEAK IT
BACK INTO EDIE'S HOUSE?

11:01.862 --> 11:04.865
WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?
 TOM, IF YOU'RE
GONNA FREAK OUT,

11:04.865 --> 11:07.868
CAN YOU DO THAT IN THE OTHER
ROOM? I'M KIND OF BUSY HERE.

11:07.868 --> 11:10.841
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO US?
I MEAN, W-WE'RE POSTING BAIL,

11:10.841 --> 11:13.373
RETURNING STOLEN GUNS--
WHEN DID THIS BECOME OUR LIFE?

11:13.373 --> 11:15.375
IF EDIE REPORTS
THIS GUN MISSING,

11:15.375 --> 11:18.078
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
THE SHARPEST COP ON THE FORCE

11:18.078 --> 11:20.080
TO FIGURE OUT
WHERE TO START LOOKING,

11:20.080 --> 11:23.083
AND THAT'S THE LAST THING
WE NEED RIGHT NOW.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.085
THANK GOD FOR YOU, LYNETTE.

11:25.085 --> 11:28.288
YOU ALWAYS KNOW
WHAT TO DO IN A CRISIS.
 WELL, I TRY. (blows)

11:30.090 --> 11:32.793
YOU'RE MY ROCK. LYNETTE.
YOU KNOW THAT, DON'T YOU?

11:32.793 --> 11:36.096
TOM, YOUR ROCK IS TRYING TO GET
FINGERPRINTS OFF A WEAPON.

11:36.096 --> 11:39.069
YOU MIND?

11:39.069 --> 11:40.971
THANKS.

11:40.971 --> 11:42.873
(blows)

11:42.873 --> 11:44.905
(door opens)

11:44.905 --> 11:47.838
YOU'RE HOME KIND OF EARLY.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

11:49.780 --> 11:52.783
GO UP TO YOUR ROOM.
I'LL COME IN IN A MINUTE.

11:52.783 --> 11:55.746
WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

11:55.746 --> 11:57.087
WHAT DID HAPPEN?

11:57.087 --> 11:59.950
WELL, M.J. THREW HIS
HOT FUDGE SUNDAE AT KATHERINE.

11:59.950 --> 12:03.323
(laughs) SERIOUSLY?

12:03.323 --> 12:06.156
THAT'S TERRIBLE.
IS SHE OKAY?

12:06.156 --> 12:07.858
WELL, SHE'S GOT NUTS

12:07.858 --> 12:09.860
AND WHIPPED CREAM
ALL IN HER HAIR,

12:09.860 --> 12:13.103
AND THAT LITTLE PLASTIC COCONUT
BOWL SCRATCHED HER FOREHEAD.
 (stifles laugh)

12:13.103 --> 12:14.805
SUSAN.

12:14.805 --> 12:16.837
I'M SORRY.
THE--THE IMAGE IN MY MIND IS

12:16.837 --> 12:19.109
PROBABLY WAY FUNNIER
THAN WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.

12:19.109 --> 12:21.011
WHY DID M.J. DO THAT?

12:21.011 --> 12:23.013
I DON'T KNOW.
KATHERINE AND I WERE TALKING

12:23.013 --> 12:24.314
ABOUT SPENDING CHRISTMAS
IN BERMUDA,

12:24.314 --> 12:26.316
AND SHE SAID
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GO,

12:26.316 --> 12:29.119
'CAUSE SHE THINKS SHE DOESN'T
LOOK GOOD IN A BATHING SUIT,

12:29.119 --> 12:30.821
AND I SAID SHE COULD BE

12:30.821 --> 12:32.823
ON THE COVER
OF "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED,"

12:32.823 --> 12:36.827
AND BAM! M.J. THROWS
HIS DESSERT.
 THAT'S THE WORST THING
I'VE EVER HEARD.

12:36.827 --> 12:39.990
WELL, HE IS ONLY 5.
 NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT
THAT LINE YOU FED HER.

12:39.990 --> 12:41.892
"SPORTS ILLUSTRATED"?

12:41.892 --> 12:44.194
WHAT'S THE ISSUE ABOUT,
THE SENIOR OLYMPICS?

12:44.194 --> 12:46.366
I'M GOING TO TALK TO M.J.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.368
I MEAN, I COULD SEE HER

12:48.368 --> 12:50.370
ON THE COVER
OF "MENOPAUSE MONTHLY."

12:52.372 --> 12:54.044
(door shuts)

12:54.044 --> 12:57.047
(laughter,
indistinct conversations)

13:02.082 --> 13:04.254
EVERYTHING IS
STILL A LITTLE BLURRY.

13:04.254 --> 13:07.357
I CAN ONLY MAKE OUT,
LIKE, SHAPES AND SHADOWS.

13:07.357 --> 13:11.021
BUT IN A WEEK OR SO, EVERYTHING
SHOULD BE CLEAR AS A BELL.

13:11.021 --> 13:13.263
WOW. THE WHOLE THING'S
LIKE A MIRACLE.

13:13.263 --> 13:16.266
AND GABY HAS BEEN SO PATIENT
THROUGH ALL OF THIS.

13:16.266 --> 13:18.268
SHE'S REALLY BEEN AN ANGEL.

13:18.268 --> 13:20.570
DAMN IT, CARLOS.
WHAT ARE YOU, A MORON?

13:20.570 --> 13:23.033
AH, I HEAR A LITTLE VOICE
FROM HEAVEN NOW.

13:23.033 --> 13:25.205
WHY AREN'T YOU WEARING
YOUR BLACKOUT GLASSES?

13:25.205 --> 13:28.909
THE DOCTOR SAYS YOUR EYES
CAN'T BE EXPOSED TO ANY LIGHT.

13:28.909 --> 13:33.113
I CAN ONLY HANDLE MY HUSBAND
GOING BLIND ONCE PER MARRIAGE.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.115
WHOOPS. WAS THAT MY BASEBALL?

13:35.115 --> 13:38.288
YEAH. I GOT IT.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?
PRETTY COOL, HUH?

13:38.288 --> 13:41.591
UH, YEAH. IT'S... ROUND.

13:41.591 --> 13:44.254
LOOK AT IT.
IT WAS SIGNED BY LOU GEHRIG.

13:48.158 --> 13:50.530
UM...

13:50.530 --> 13:52.332
(mouths words)

13:52.332 --> 13:54.064
OH, LOOKY THERE.

13:54.064 --> 13:56.136
LOU GEHRIG. WOW.

13:56.136 --> 13:59.139
IT WAS A GIFT PASSED DOWN
FROM MY GRANDFATHER TO MY FATHER

13:59.139 --> 14:02.342
THEN TO ME.
 IT WAS? I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

14:02.342 --> 14:05.145
I THOUGHT IT WAS
SOME STUPID COLLECTORS ITEM.

14:05.145 --> 14:08.148
(laughs) NO. THAT'S WHY
I WOULDN'T LET YOU SELL IT

14:08.148 --> 14:11.521
WHEN WE WERE LOW ON CASH.

14:11.521 --> 14:14.885
UH, CARLOS, I THINK IT'S TIME
TO PUT YOUR EYEDROPS IN.

14:14.885 --> 14:16.887
WHY DON'T YOU GO DO THAT?

14:16.887 --> 14:19.329
EXCUSE ME, LADIES.

14:22.462 --> 14:26.136
OH, DON'T LOOK AT ME THAT WAY.
I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.

14:26.136 --> 14:29.139
GABY, YOU NEVER SELL
A MAN'S AUTOGRAPHED BASEBALL.

14:29.139 --> 14:30.640
THE CAR NEEDED TIRES.

14:30.640 --> 14:34.304
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW
HE WAS GONNA GET HIS SIGHT BACK?

14:34.304 --> 14:37.307
I MEAN,
OF ALL THE ROTTEN LUCK.
 WHO DID YOU SELL THE BALL TO?

14:37.307 --> 14:40.010
I DON'T KNOW.
SOME ITALIAN GUY.

14:40.010 --> 14:41.511
HEY, MIKE'S INTO BASEBALL.

14:41.511 --> 14:44.484
HE MUST KNOW SOMEONE WHO CAN
TRACK DOWN THIS LOU GEHRIG GUY

14:44.484 --> 14:48.288
AND GET HIM TO SIGN A NEW ONE.

14:48.288 --> 14:52.192
WHAT?

14:52.192 --> 14:54.925
(Tom) IT'S OKAY.

14:54.925 --> 14:57.928
WHAT'S GOING ON?
IS THERE NEWS?
 THE JUDGE JUST SET BAIL.

14:57.928 --> 15:00.530
OH, THANK GOD. HOW MUCH?
 $20,000.

15:00.530 --> 15:04.174
THAT'S HIGH. WHERE ARE WE GONNA
GET THAT KIND OF MONEY?

15:04.174 --> 15:06.176
I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO TAP
OUR EMERGENCY FUND.

15:06.176 --> 15:08.578
WE'VE GOT 14 GRAND IN THERE.

15:08.578 --> 15:11.982
WE'VE GOT ANOTHER 800 MORE
IN THE CHRISTMAS CLUB.

15:11.982 --> 15:14.114
LOOK,
WE'LL SCRAPE IT TOGETHER.
 (cell phone beeps)

15:14.114 --> 15:16.116
OH, GOD. G--I GOTTA GET
TO THE RESTAURANT.

15:16.116 --> 15:19.419
LYNETTE, CAN YOU GO TO THE BANK
AND TAKE CARE OF THAT?
 OH, SURE.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.351
OKAY. GOOD. THANK YOU.
 YEAH.

15:21.351 --> 15:24.224
OKAY, WELL,
I'LL NOTIFY THE JUDGE

15:24.224 --> 15:27.397
THAT YOU INTEND TO POST BAIL.
 WAIT. SLOW DOWN.

15:27.397 --> 15:29.629
WHAT?
 YOU'RE MY LAWYER,

15:29.629 --> 15:32.932
SO ANYTHING I TELL YOU
IS IN CONFIDENCE, RIGHT?

15:32.932 --> 15:35.135
WELL, TECHNICALLY,
I'M PORTER'S LAWYER, SO DON'T--

15:35.135 --> 15:38.568
JUST GO WITH ME ON THIS.
THERE IS NO EMERGENCY FUND.

15:38.568 --> 15:40.570
I GAVE THAT MONEY
TO ANNE SCHILLING

15:40.570 --> 15:44.274
SO SHE'D LEAVE TOWN,
AND TOM HAS NO IDEA.

15:44.274 --> 15:46.276
OKAY, JUST SO I HAVE
THIS STRAIGHT,

15:46.276 --> 15:49.349
YOU PAID OFF A POTENTIAL WITNESS
TO GET HER TO FLEE?

15:49.349 --> 15:51.951
HEY.
WHOSE LAWYER ARE YOU ANYWAY?

15:51.951 --> 15:53.583
AGAIN, I'M PORTER'S--

15:53.583 --> 15:57.327
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? WHERE
AM I GONNA GET THAT BAIL MONEY?

15:57.327 --> 15:59.729
YOU COULD GO TO A BAIL BONDSMAN,
PUT UP THE HOUSE AS COLLATERAL.

15:59.729 --> 16:02.432
NO. THE HOUSE IS MORTGAGED
TO THE TEETH.

16:02.432 --> 16:04.964
WELL,
THERE IS THE RESTAURANT.

16:04.964 --> 16:09.139
I GUESS I HAVE
NO OTHER CHOICE.

16:09.139 --> 16:12.272
BUT AGAIN, THIS IS ALL
IN THE STRICTEST CONFIDENCE.

16:12.272 --> 16:15.705
REMEMBER, YOU ARE MY LAWYER,
NOT TOM'S.

16:15.705 --> 16:18.208
ACTUALLY, LYNETTE, I'M--

16:18.208 --> 16:19.979
SHUT UP!

16:31.161 --> 16:33.123
SO YOU SEE, IT BELONGED
TO MY HUSBAND'S GRANDFATHER,

16:33.123 --> 16:35.125
AND IF I DON'T GET IT BACK,

16:35.125 --> 16:38.268
I AM TELLING YOU,
I'M GONNA BE IN THE CRAPPER.

16:38.268 --> 16:43.433
(speaking Italian)

16:43.433 --> 16:46.206
...CRAPPER.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.638
(speaks Italian)

16:48.638 --> 16:51.311
(speaks Italian)
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

16:51.311 --> 16:55.215
(speaks Italian)
...MEANS "NO WAY." I'M SORRY.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.217
OH, PLEASE.
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

16:57.217 --> 17:01.351
(speaking Italian)

17:01.351 --> 17:05.525
(speaks Italian)

17:05.525 --> 17:11.330
(continues
speaking Italian)

17:11.330 --> 17:13.063
(sighs) VA BENE. VA BENE.

17:13.063 --> 17:14.763
WHAT? WHAT'S HE SAYING?

17:14.763 --> 17:18.538
(sighs) HE'D LIKE
TO WATCH YOU DANCE...

17:18.538 --> 17:21.141
WHAT?

17:21.141 --> 17:23.413
ON THE TABLE.

17:25.415 --> 17:28.047
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:28.047 --> 17:31.050
I'M GONNA HAVE TO CALL
A BIG, FAT... (speaks Italian)

17:31.050 --> 17:33.483
ON THAT ONE.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.692
OH. HI, LYNETTE.
 HEY.

17:42.692 --> 17:45.165
SO SORRY ABOUT PORTER.

17:45.165 --> 17:48.468
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
THAT WE CAN DO...
 WELL, ACTUALLY, I WANTED
TO BORROW EDIE'S YELLOW SWEATER

17:48.468 --> 17:51.341
FOR THE, UH, ARRAIGNMENT.

17:51.341 --> 17:53.743
OH. YEAH.

17:53.743 --> 17:55.545
SORRY. EDIE'S NOT HERE.

17:55.545 --> 17:59.649
WELL, IS IT OKAY
IF I GO UP AND GET IT?

18:04.083 --> 18:05.455
YEAH.

18:05.455 --> 18:07.387
SURE. GO AHEAD.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.259
THANKS.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.310
(grunts)

18:51.331 --> 18:54.604
(lowered voice)
PLEASE. YOU HAVE TO LEAVE.

18:56.366 --> 18:59.369
THIS ISN'T A GOOD TIME,
OKAY?

18:59.369 --> 19:02.812
FINE. I'LL--I'LL COME SEE YOU
TOMORROW.

19:02.812 --> 19:05.415
JUST KNOW
THAT I STILL LOVE YOU,

19:05.415 --> 19:06.916
AND THAT'LL NEVER CHANGE.

19:09.619 --> 19:11.881
(under breath) NEVER CHANGE.

19:18.288 --> 19:22.262
(clock ticking loudly)

19:24.163 --> 19:27.166
WELL, LET ME START BY SAYING,
IT'S SO NICE TO SEE YOU

19:27.166 --> 19:29.339
IN A SOCIAL SETTING,
DR. COMINIS.

19:29.339 --> 19:32.302
OH, PLEASE. I INSIST
YOU CALL ME ALEX NOW.

19:32.302 --> 19:34.274
ALL RIGHT THEN, ALEX.

19:34.274 --> 19:37.347
OH, LOOK AT YOU TWO,
SITTING SO FAR APART.

19:37.347 --> 19:38.778
SCOOTCH OVER.

19:38.778 --> 19:43.353
UH, MOM, W-WE--WE DON'T NEED
TO SCOOTCH.

19:43.353 --> 19:46.356
WELL, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW,
IF YOU NEED TO SCOOTCH, ALEX,

19:46.356 --> 19:49.289
I AM OKAY WITH SCOOTCHING
AND...

19:49.289 --> 19:51.321
THE REST OF IT.

19:51.321 --> 19:55.425
UH, LOOK, MOM, AS MUCH AS
WE APPRECIATE YOUR TOLERANCE,

19:55.425 --> 19:58.428
UH, WE CAN WAIT
UNTIL WE GET HOME TO MAKE OUT.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.502
WELL, I JUST WANT
YOU BOYS TO KNOW

20:02.502 --> 20:05.435
THAT I AM COMFORTABLE
WITH YOUR LIFESTYLE.

20:05.435 --> 20:07.437
NOW WHO WOULD LIKE
A STRAWBERRY DAIQUIRI?

20:07.437 --> 20:09.539
(doorbell rings)

20:09.539 --> 20:12.882
ARE--ARE YOU
EXPECTING SOMEONE?

20:12.882 --> 20:14.884
WELL, ORSON AND I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE NICE

20:14.884 --> 20:17.417
TO SHARE THIS SPECIAL OCCASION
WITH SOME DEAR FRIENDS.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.389
(speaking indistinctly)

20:21.591 --> 20:24.324
BOB AND LEE? WHAT,
ARE YOU SPONSORING A FLOAT?

20:24.324 --> 20:26.326
BREE, YOU HANDLE
THE INTRODUCTIONS,

20:26.326 --> 20:28.298
AND I WILL CHECK ON DINNER.

20:28.298 --> 20:30.930
BOB HUNTER, LEE McDERMOTT,
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO MEET

20:30.930 --> 20:33.603
ANDREW'S NEW LIFE PARTNER,
DR. ALEX COMINIS.

20:33.603 --> 20:35.265
HI.
 OOH. A DOCTOR.

20:35.265 --> 20:37.337
HE'S A PLASTIC SURGEON.
 MM-HMM. YOU HEAR THAT, BOB?

20:37.337 --> 20:40.340
I LIKE MY EYES
THE WAY THEY ARE.
 YOU'RE SO TOUCHY. HI.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.441
(laughs)

20:41.441 --> 20:43.573
HAVE WE MET?

20:43.573 --> 20:45.345
NOT THAT I RECALL.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.577
NO, WE HAVE. I-I CAN'T
THINK WHERE, THOUGH.

20:47.577 --> 20:50.320
I HEAR THE GYM IS
A POPULAR MEETING PLACE.

20:50.320 --> 20:53.383
NO, IT'S NOT THAT.
 OH!

20:53.383 --> 20:56.756
MY MISTAKE. I MUST--I MUST HAVE
YOU CONFUSED WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.588
DINNER'S READY.

20:58.588 --> 21:00.390
(Orson) SHALL WE?

21:01.831 --> 21:04.394
(whispers) NOT SO FAST.
DO YOU KNOW THAT GUY?

21:04.394 --> 21:07.537
YES.
(whispering indistinctly)

21:07.537 --> 21:10.400
OH, MY GOD. YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT IS HIM.
 MM-HMM.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.282
CARLOS, WHAT'S WRONG?

21:23.282 --> 21:25.355
(crying) GABY, I CAN SEE THEM.

21:25.355 --> 21:27.657
WHAT?!
 I CAN MAKE OUT COLORS
AND SHAPES.

21:27.657 --> 21:30.520
EVERYTHING'S STARTING
TO COME INTO FOCUS.

21:30.520 --> 21:33.563
OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S WONDERFUL! OH! (laughs)

21:33.563 --> 21:35.595
LOOK AT ALL MY GIRLS.

21:35.595 --> 21:38.428
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
SHE DOES LOOK LIKE MAMA.

21:38.428 --> 21:41.371
OH, I TOLD YOU.
 DADDY, NOW YOU CAN
WATCH ME DANCE.

21:41.371 --> 21:43.573
I KNOW. I CAN'T WAIT.
OH, IT'S AMAZING.

21:43.573 --> 21:45.575
I CAN MAKE OUT
ALMOST EVERYTHING--

21:45.575 --> 21:48.638
THE FIREPLACE,
OUR DINING TABLE.

21:48.638 --> 21:51.511
WHERE'S THE PAINTING
THAT WE BOUGHT IN GREECE?

21:51.511 --> 21:55.014
OH. I HAD TO SELL IT
A FEW MONTHS AGO

21:55.014 --> 21:57.086
SO I COULD MAKE THE MORTGAGE.
I'M SORRY.

21:57.086 --> 22:00.820
MM. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THINGS.
I CAN SEE MY FAMILY.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.321
THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

22:02.321 --> 22:05.455
(sighs) REALLY? THAT MAKES ME
FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.

22:05.455 --> 22:07.457
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
ALL THE STUPID THINGS

22:07.457 --> 22:09.459
I'VE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT.
 LIKE WHAT?

22:09.459 --> 22:12.432
OH, IT'S SILLY. I SOLD
THAT BASEBALL OF YOURS.

22:12.432 --> 22:15.635
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU CAN SEE,
AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

22:15.635 --> 22:18.938
YOU SOLD
MY LOU GEHRIG BASEBALL?

22:18.938 --> 22:22.812
YEAH, BUT IT'S JUST A THING.
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THINGS.

22:22.812 --> 22:24.974
RIGHT, RIGHT.
BUT IT WAS MY FATHER'S

22:24.974 --> 22:27.477
AND HIS FATHER'S BEFORE HIM.

22:27.477 --> 22:33.653
YEAH, AND I KNOW THAT NOW,
BUT...

22:33.653 --> 22:36.355
JUANITA, DANCE FOR YOUR DAD.

22:36.355 --> 22:39.659
JUANITA, ACTUALLY,
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE YOUR SISTER

22:39.659 --> 22:43.393
AND, UH, GO TO THE KITCHEN
AND GET SOME COOKIES?

22:43.393 --> 22:46.436
I'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE.

22:48.137 --> 22:51.771
THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL DAY
FOR ALL OF US,

22:51.771 --> 22:54.103
SO I'M NOT GONNA GET MAD.

22:54.103 --> 22:57.407
UH, I'M JUST GONNA SAY
THAT I DON'T KNOW

22:57.407 --> 22:59.909
WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH
THAT FEATHERHEAD OF YOURS,

22:59.909 --> 23:02.452
BUT I WANT THAT BASEBALL BACK.
GOT IT?

23:02.452 --> 23:04.854
HEY, THIS FEATHERHEAD KEPT THIS
FAMILY AFLOAT FOR FIVE YEARS.

23:04.854 --> 23:06.986
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I HAD TO DO

23:06.986 --> 23:09.989
TO KEEP THIS ROOF
OVER OUR HEADS.
 LOOK, THERE WERE TWO THINGS
THAT I ASKED YOU NOT TO SELL--

23:09.989 --> 23:13.423
MY BASEBALL AND MY WATCH.
 I DIDN'T SELL YOUR WATCH.

23:13.423 --> 23:16.526
ONLY BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T GET IT
OFF MY WRIST, YOU LITTLE THIEF.

23:16.526 --> 23:18.528
GABY, YOU LIED.

23:18.528 --> 23:21.531
I WANT THAT BASEBALL BACK,
AND YOU'RE GONNA GET IT.

23:21.531 --> 23:23.733
AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOWER
THE MIDDLE FINGER.

23:23.733 --> 23:25.735
I CAN SEE NOW, REMEMBER?

23:25.735 --> 23:29.839
RIGHT. DAMN.

23:29.839 --> 23:32.682
(laughter)

23:32.682 --> 23:36.486
(clears throat)

23:36.486 --> 23:38.448
BREE, THAT WAS HANDS-DOWN

23:38.448 --> 23:41.851
THE BEST DINNER
I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.
 YOU ARE SO SWEET.

23:41.851 --> 23:45.695
YOU KNOW, BREE IS THE NUMBER ONE
CATERER IN FAIRVIEW.

23:45.695 --> 23:48.458
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
DO YOU DO WEDDINGS?
 (kicks leg)

23:48.458 --> 23:51.531
OW!
I WASN'T GONNA SAY ANYTHING.

23:51.531 --> 23:53.933
SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT?

23:53.933 --> 23:56.666
UH, NOTHING.
(chuckles) NOTHING.

23:58.868 --> 24:01.611
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TELL THEM SOMETIME.

24:04.614 --> 24:06.946
OH, MY GOODNESS,
ARE YOU TWO...

24:06.946 --> 24:10.179
YES, YES. WE'RE...
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

24:12.151 --> 24:13.823
AND I HATE YOU.

24:13.823 --> 24:14.984
(chuckles)

24:14.984 --> 24:18.227
OH, MY GOD.
 CONGRATULATIONS.

24:18.227 --> 24:19.989
OH, MY GOD. YAY.

24:19.989 --> 24:23.192
(Lee) WOW.
 SEE HOW EXCITED THEY ARE?
WHY WOULD YOU

24:23.192 --> 24:26.095
WANNA KEEP IT A SECRET?
 I AM GONNA HANDLE EVERYTHING
FOR THIS WEDDING.

24:26.095 --> 24:27.697
THAT'S WHY.

24:27.697 --> 24:30.940
NOW LET ME GIVE
MY NEW SON-IN-LAW A HUG.

24:32.972 --> 24:35.474
(whispers indistinctly)

24:35.474 --> 24:37.176
BUTT OUT.

24:37.176 --> 24:39.208
WELL, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

24:39.208 --> 24:44.153
I AM GOING TO GO GET A PIE
THAT YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE.

24:44.153 --> 24:47.186
AND YOU TWO ARE
GOING TO HELP ME.

24:52.692 --> 24:55.695
(lowered voice) ALL RIGHT,
YOU TWO, WHAT IS GOING ON?

24:55.695 --> 24:58.528
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
 DON'T GIVE ME THAT.

24:58.528 --> 25:00.830
YOU'VE BEEN WHISPERING
TO EACH OTHER ALL NIGHT.

25:00.830 --> 25:03.903
YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW ALEX. HOW?
 IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

25:03.903 --> 25:05.905
THE MAN IS
GOING TO MARRY MY SON.

25:05.905 --> 25:08.538
IF THERE IS SOMETHING
ABOUT HIM I SHOULD KNOW,

25:08.538 --> 25:11.541
I WANT TO HEAR IT NOW,
PLEASE.

25:11.541 --> 25:13.883
(mouths word)

25:13.883 --> 25:17.787
WE THINK WE SAW HIM IN...
AN ADULT MOVIE.

25:17.787 --> 25:22.922
BY "ADULT," YOU MEAN COMPLEX
AND SOPHISTICATED?

25:22.922 --> 25:24.994
NO, WE MEAN GAY PORN.

25:24.994 --> 25:26.726
WHAT?

25:26.726 --> 25:28.828
WE SAW THIS MOVIE,
"REAR DEPLOYMENT."

25:28.828 --> 25:30.299
ALL THE ACTORS PLAYED SOLDIERS.

25:30.299 --> 25:32.301
BOB LIKES UNIFORMS, SO...
 OH, THANK YOU.

25:32.301 --> 25:34.303
NO, NO, NO.
THIS CAN'T POSSIBLY BE TRUE.

25:34.303 --> 25:37.266
THE MAN IS A DOCTOR.
ARE YOU SURE?

25:37.266 --> 25:39.268
WELL, WE MIGHT BE WRONG.

25:39.268 --> 25:41.771
NO. WE RENTED IT
LAST MONTH.

25:41.771 --> 25:44.173
WE PAID THE LATE CHARGES.

25:44.173 --> 25:45.715
TRUST ME. THAT'S HIM.

25:59.258 --> 26:01.330
I JUST DON'T THINK
THEY SHOULD ADVERTISE SOMETHING

26:01.330 --> 26:03.332
WITH A LIFETIME GUARANTEE
IF IT'S GONNA BREAK

26:03.332 --> 26:06.335
AFTER FOUR MONTHS.
 OR MAYBE YOU USED YOUR CORKSCREW
AS MUCH IN FOUR MONTHS

26:06.335 --> 26:09.739
AS MOST PEOPLE DO IN A LIFETIME.
EVER THINK OF THAT?
 (doorbell rings)

26:09.739 --> 26:12.742
YOUR MOMMY LASHES OUT AT PEOPLE
PRETTIER THAN SHE IS.

26:12.742 --> 26:14.844
YOU EVER NOTICE THAT?

26:15.875 --> 26:16.976
HI.

26:16.976 --> 26:18.307
HEY.

26:18.307 --> 26:21.911
HEY, KATHERINE.
WHAT A CUTE TOP.

26:25.154 --> 26:28.217
SO, UH,
WHERE YOU GUYS OFF TO?

26:28.217 --> 26:31.661
BOWLING. COME ON, BUDDY.
LET'S GET YOUR JACKET.

26:31.661 --> 26:34.794
BY THE WAY, UH, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE ANY PROBLEM.

26:34.794 --> 26:36.796
I HAD A LITTLE TALK WITH M.J.

26:36.796 --> 26:40.129
SURE YOU DID.

26:40.129 --> 26:41.831
WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

26:41.831 --> 26:44.033
IT MEANS THINGS WILL BE
A LOT EASIER WITH M.J.

26:44.033 --> 26:47.837
IF YOU WEREN'T TALKING TRASH
ABOUT ME AND MIKE DATING.

26:47.837 --> 26:50.279
WHAT? (scoffs)
I DON'T DO THAT.

26:50.279 --> 26:52.381
REALLY?
M.J. ALWAYS LIKED ME BEFORE,

26:52.381 --> 26:54.383
AND THEN I START SEEING MIKE,

26:54.383 --> 26:57.016
AND SUDDENLY, I'M TAKING
INCOMING ROCKY ROAD.

26:57.016 --> 27:00.249
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO KNOCK OVER
SOME PINS. SEE YOU, LADIES.

27:00.249 --> 27:01.851
(Susan) OKAY.
 BYE.

27:07.256 --> 27:08.397
WHAT?

27:08.397 --> 27:11.931
I HAVE NEVER SAID A NEGATIVE
WORD ABOUT THEM DATING EVER.

27:11.931 --> 27:15.634
I BELIEVE YOU. IT'S JUST--
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.667
IT'S THE WAY YOU ACT
WHEN SHE'S AROUND.

27:17.667 --> 27:19.669
KIDS PICK UP ON THAT STUFF.

27:19.669 --> 27:21.871
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
THE WAY I ACT?

27:21.871 --> 27:25.274
"OH, KATHERINE,
WHAT A CUTE TOP."

27:25.274 --> 27:27.316
KID TRANSLATION--
"HAVE A NICE TIME

27:27.316 --> 27:29.919
AT THE BOWLING ALLEY
WITH MY EX, WHORE."

27:29.919 --> 27:33.222
OKAY. IT-IT'S
A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE,

27:33.222 --> 27:35.124
THIS WHOLE SITUATION.

27:35.124 --> 27:37.126
I MEAN,
IF M.J.'s PICKING UP ON IT,

27:37.126 --> 27:39.128
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO FIX THAT?

27:39.128 --> 27:41.390
WELL, I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT FIXING IT.

27:41.390 --> 27:44.363
TWO OF MY FRIENDS INVOLVED
IN A NASTY CATFIGHT...

27:44.363 --> 27:48.037
(laughs)
I LIVE FOR THAT STUFF.

27:48.037 --> 27:49.969
THANKS FOR THE CORKSCREW.

27:52.371 --> 27:54.203
(sighs)

28:00.309 --> 28:03.152
THERE YOU GO, SWEETIE.
IS THAT TIGHT ENOUGH?

28:03.152 --> 28:04.984
I GUESS.

28:06.315 --> 28:08.017
(cell phone beeps)

28:08.017 --> 28:09.859
(pins clacking)

28:09.859 --> 28:14.163
WHAT IS GOING ON? WHY WERE YOU
ON THE PHONE SO LONG?

28:14.163 --> 28:16.966
UM, SUSAN'S COMING.
 WHAT? WHY?

28:16.966 --> 28:19.969
WELL, SHE WANTS M.J. TO SEE US
ALL HAVING A GOOD TIME TOGETHER.

28:19.969 --> 28:22.932
THAT WAY, HE MIGHT BE
MORE ACCEPTING OF YOU AND ME.

28:22.932 --> 28:25.334
(sighs) I SUPPOSE
IT'S NOT A TERRIBLE IDEA.

28:25.334 --> 28:27.336
WELL, I THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

28:27.336 --> 28:30.740
SHE FEELS LIKE SHE'S BEEN
SENDING THE WRONG SIGNALS,

28:30.740 --> 28:32.311
AND SHE WANTS
TO MAKE UP FOR IT.

28:32.311 --> 28:34.313
WELL,
IT'S NICE OF HER TO TRY,

28:34.313 --> 28:37.316
BUT JUST HOW MUCH OF A SHOW WAS
SHE PLANNING TO PUT ON FOR--

28:37.316 --> 28:39.849
HEY, EVERYBODY!

28:39.849 --> 28:42.321
ARE WE READY TO HAVE
THE BEST TIME EVER?

28:42.321 --> 28:45.094
(laughs)

28:47.296 --> 28:49.929
(children shouting and laughing)

28:49.929 --> 28:52.431
(girl) THIS IS SO MUCH FUN!
DID YOU WIN?

28:52.431 --> 28:55.204
DON'T FALL DOWN, OKAY?
I'M NOT CARRYING YOU HOME.

28:55.204 --> 28:57.506
I'M FINE. STOP WORRYING.

28:57.506 --> 29:00.770
(children continue
shouting indistinctly)

29:08.017 --> 29:09.979
HEY.

29:09.979 --> 29:13.082
LOOK WHO JUST GOT
BAILED OUT.

29:15.384 --> 29:17.486
YOU GOT A LOT OF BALLS,
KID.

29:17.486 --> 29:20.189
YOU NAIL MY WIFE,
YOU BREAK UP MY FAMILY,

29:20.189 --> 29:23.062
YOU BURN DOWN MY BUSINESS.

29:23.062 --> 29:26.035
I DIDN'T BURN DOWN
YOUR CLUB.

29:26.035 --> 29:29.969
AND YOU CAN ACCUSE ME ALL YOU
WANT, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO JAIL.

29:29.969 --> 29:33.873
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D WANT TO GO THERE.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.945
IT'S A HELL OF A LOT SAFER.

29:35.945 --> 29:38.247
OTHERWISE, SOMEDAY,

29:38.247 --> 29:40.279
YOU'LL BE WALKING HOME
FROM SCHOOL

29:40.279 --> 29:43.412
OR WORK
OR YOUR BUDDY'S HOUSE,

29:43.412 --> 29:45.454
AND YOU'LL JUST...

29:45.454 --> 29:47.817
DISAPPEAR.

29:47.817 --> 29:51.220
POOF!

29:51.220 --> 29:53.392
AND IF THEY ASK ME
ABOUT IT,

29:53.392 --> 29:56.465
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M GONNA TELL 'EM?

29:56.465 --> 29:59.298
I WAS AT THE MOVIES.

30:02.371 --> 30:05.234
ENJOY YOUR FREEDOM.

30:12.912 --> 30:15.414
UM, SO RIGHT DOWN
THE MIDDLE...
 OKAY.

30:15.414 --> 30:17.546
NO GUTTER BALLS.
 RIGHT.

30:17.546 --> 30:19.548
THEY'RE GETTING ALONG GREAT,
HUH?

30:19.548 --> 30:21.250
YOU'RE WELCOME.

30:21.250 --> 30:24.523
HEY. I ADMIT IT. YOU BEING HERE
DOES SEEM TO BE HELPING.

30:24.523 --> 30:26.926
(singsongy)
YOU'RE WELCOME.

30:26.926 --> 30:29.398
OKAY, LET IT GO. ALL RIGHT.

30:31.560 --> 30:33.262
GOD, LOOK AT HIM.

30:33.262 --> 30:36.005
REMEMBER WHEN HE NEEDED ONE
OF THOSE LITTLE KIDDIE BALLS

30:36.005 --> 30:39.268
THE SIZE OF A CANTALOUPE?
HE'S GETTING SO BIG.
 I KNOW.

30:39.268 --> 30:42.311
YOU KNOW, THAT COLTS JERSEY YOU
BOUGHT HIM DOESN'T FIT ANYMORE.

30:42.311 --> 30:44.243
NO. GOD.

30:44.243 --> 30:46.015
I'M GONNA TRY IT.

30:49.418 --> 30:51.350
HOW DID THAT LITTLE PEEWEE
WE BROUGHT BACK

30:51.350 --> 30:53.953
FROM THE HOSPITAL
TURN INTO THIS BRUISER?
 MM.

30:53.953 --> 30:56.125
MIKE, I NEED YOU.
I GOT ANOTHER SPLIT.

30:56.125 --> 30:58.357
WHAT DID I SAY ABOUT
AIMING THE BALL?

30:58.357 --> 31:01.390
I DON'T REMEMBER.
COME SHOW ME.

31:03.492 --> 31:06.395
UM, BE RIGHT THERE.

31:10.299 --> 31:12.371
AAH! AAH!

31:12.371 --> 31:15.474
AH! OW!

31:15.474 --> 31:16.946
AAH!

31:52.641 --> 31:54.944
HEY THERE.

31:54.944 --> 31:56.946
DO YOU HAVE A SECOND?

32:01.250 --> 32:04.954
NOW WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

32:04.954 --> 32:07.456
A VIDEO STORE
I WILL NEVER RETURN TO.

32:07.456 --> 32:11.230
ARE YOU AWARE THAT ONE
OF THE STARS OF THIS FILM IS--

32:11.230 --> 32:13.632
YES. I KNOW ABOUT
ALEX'S MOVIE, MOM.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.504
YOU DO?

32:15.504 --> 32:17.366
YEAH.
HE TOLD ME A LONG TIME AGO.

32:17.366 --> 32:20.339
HE CALLS IT THE BIGGEST MISTAKE
HE'S EVER MADE.

32:20.339 --> 32:22.241
WHY WOULD HE--

32:22.241 --> 32:24.974
WELL, HE COULDN'T AFFORD
THE TUITION TO MED SCHOOL,

32:24.974 --> 32:27.476
AND HE WAS APPROACHED
BY THIS SO-CALLED DIRECTOR,

32:27.476 --> 32:31.380
AND WELL, HE...

32:31.380 --> 32:33.382
ANYWAY,
I WOULD APPRECIATE IT

32:33.382 --> 32:35.324
IF YOU DIDN'T LET ON
THAT YOU KNOW.

32:37.256 --> 32:39.388
AND YOU'RE OKAY WITH THIS?

32:41.430 --> 32:43.332
YEAH. WELL, YOU KNOW, I MEAN,

32:43.332 --> 32:47.266
WE BOTH KNOW THAT I HAVE SORT OF
AN INTERESTING PAST MYSELF.

32:47.266 --> 32:49.368
SO, YOU KNOW, UH,

32:49.368 --> 32:52.401
GLASS HOUSES, STONES.

32:55.144 --> 32:59.148
NOT TO MENTION THE FACT
THAT I-I LOVE HIM...

32:59.148 --> 33:00.479
VERY MUCH.

33:03.452 --> 33:05.314
SO...

33:05.314 --> 33:07.986
HE'S THE ONE?

33:10.159 --> 33:11.620
YES, MOM.

33:11.620 --> 33:16.095
EVEN WITH HIS SORDID PAST,
HE'S THE ONE.

33:20.729 --> 33:23.432
WHY DID YOU
BRING THIS HERE?

33:23.432 --> 33:25.504
YOU'RE GOING TO MARRY HIM.

33:25.504 --> 33:28.006
I THOUGHT HE WASN'T
BEING HONEST WITH YOU.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.139
I WANTED TO PROTECT YOU,
SO I--

33:30.139 --> 33:32.511
SO YOU DECIDED TO MEDDLE
IN MY LOVE LIFE?

33:32.511 --> 33:34.783
YES.

33:37.646 --> 33:39.588
YOU KNOW WHAT, MOM?

33:39.588 --> 33:42.291
THIS MIGHT BE ABOUT
THE NICEST THING

33:42.291 --> 33:44.293
YOU'VE EVER DONE FOR ME.

33:46.255 --> 33:49.158
COME HERE.

33:49.158 --> 33:52.101
I MEAN, NOT EVERY BOY
CAN SAY THAT

33:52.101 --> 33:54.463
HIS MOTHER'S WILLING TO RENT
GAY PORN FOR THEM.

33:54.463 --> 33:57.506
YES. WHICH REMINDS ME,
THAT NEEDS TO BE BACK BY 3:00.

33:57.506 --> 34:01.070
COULD YOU?
 ABSOLUTELY. UH, YOU GOTTA
AVOID THOSE LATE FEES.

34:03.442 --> 34:06.815
OH, YOU KNOW, UM,
YOU KNOW, I CAN HAVE ALEX

34:06.815 --> 34:09.248
AUTOGRAPH THIS FOR YOU
IF YOU WANT.

34:09.248 --> 34:12.380
JUST TAKE IT BACK.

34:12.380 --> 34:15.083
(door opens)

34:17.326 --> 34:19.558
(telephone ringing)

34:19.558 --> 34:24.333
OH, MRS. SOLIS,
MAY I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING?

34:26.594 --> 34:28.496
GET YOUR BOSS.

34:28.496 --> 34:30.239
(purse thuds)

34:34.543 --> 34:37.275
(sighs deeply)

35:07.806 --> 35:10.509
THERE.

35:10.509 --> 35:12.841
YOU GOT IT BACK.

35:12.841 --> 35:14.543
WOW.

35:14.543 --> 35:16.245
WHY ARE YOU LIMPING?

35:16.245 --> 35:19.318
FELL OFF A TABLE.
DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

35:26.525 --> 35:28.126
(mouths words)

35:28.126 --> 35:30.559
(indistinct conversations)

35:30.559 --> 35:34.533
(gasps) WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?
 I JUST WANTED
TO COACH PORTER A LITTLE BIT

35:34.533 --> 35:36.535
BEFORE THE ARRAIGNMENT.
 WHAT'S HE DOING?

35:36.535 --> 35:38.837
HE NEEDED SOME TIME
TO HIMSELF.

35:38.837 --> 35:40.669
I'LL MEET YOU INSIDE.

35:40.669 --> 35:43.572
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO GIVE HIM A MOMENT.

35:43.572 --> 35:45.744
I THINK HE'S PRETTY NERVOUS.

35:45.744 --> 35:48.577
THAT'S BECAUSE HE'S PRESTON.

35:48.577 --> 35:50.479
WHAT?

35:52.881 --> 35:55.854
OH, CRAP!

35:59.558 --> 36:01.490
HEY, MOM, DAD.

36:01.490 --> 36:03.462
HEY, PRESTON.

36:03.462 --> 36:04.763
AW, YOU KNOW?

36:04.763 --> 36:08.397
OF COURSE WE KNOW.
 WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
WHERE'S PORTER?

36:08.397 --> 36:10.799
HE TOOK OFF.
 WHAT?!

36:10.799 --> 36:13.802
UH...
 HE WAS SCARED OUT OF HIS MIND.
HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO,

36:13.802 --> 36:16.605
SO HE LEFT TOWN
AND ASKED ME IF I'D HELP HIM

36:16.605 --> 36:20.749
GIVE HIM A HEAD START.
 DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW BAD
THIS IS? WE HAD TO POST BAIL.

36:20.749 --> 36:22.751
IF THE JUDGE FINDS OUT
PORTER SKIPPED TOWN,

36:22.751 --> 36:25.414
WE'RE GONNA LOSE... A LOT.

36:25.414 --> 36:29.418
GUYS. GUYS,
THEY'RE CALLING US.
 WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE'S GONNA FIND OUT RIGHT NOW,

36:29.418 --> 36:31.420
BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT GOING
IN THERE.

36:31.420 --> 36:32.721
I'D RATHER FORFEIT THE BAIL

36:32.721 --> 36:36.425
THAN RISK HAVING TWO OF MY KIDS
GO TO JAIL.
 TOM--

36:36.425 --> 36:38.427
NO, BOB WILL JUST TELL THE JUDGE
WHAT HAPPENED.

36:38.427 --> 36:41.470
WE'LL TAKE THE HIT AND WE'LL
GO FORWARD. IT'S JUST MONEY.

36:41.470 --> 36:43.572
IT'S NOT JUST MONEY.

36:43.572 --> 36:46.375
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

36:46.375 --> 36:49.608
HEY. COME ON. WE'RE UP.

36:52.611 --> 36:55.484
OKAY, LOOK...

36:57.516 --> 36:59.488
YOU KNOW HOW
YOU'RE ALWAYS SAYING

36:59.488 --> 37:02.521
I KNOW WHAT TO DO IN A CRISIS?

37:02.521 --> 37:06.525
YEAH.
 HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.
YOU--NO QUESTIONS.

37:06.525 --> 37:09.798
YOU--YOU'RE PORTER NOW.

37:09.798 --> 37:11.630
LET'S GO IN.

37:11.630 --> 37:14.863
COME ON. COME ON.

37:26.375 --> 37:28.016
(grunts)

37:33.422 --> 37:35.484
(laundry basket thuds)

37:38.927 --> 37:41.930
YOU LIKE IT?

37:41.930 --> 37:44.293
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
WHERE'D IT COME FROM?

37:44.293 --> 37:46.565
I BOUGHT IT TODAY.
IT'S YOURS.

37:46.565 --> 37:47.666
WHAT?

37:47.666 --> 37:49.538
WE CAN'T AFFORD THIS.

37:51.500 --> 37:52.801
I SOLD THE BASEBALL.

37:56.375 --> 37:59.448
YOU NEVER TOLD ME
THINGS HAD GOTTEN SO BAD.

38:00.809 --> 38:04.282
YOU WERE
BLIND AND DEPRESSED.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.955
I DIDN'T WANNA ADD TO IT.

38:06.955 --> 38:11.019
THANK YOU FOR TAKING
SUCH GOOD CARE OF US.

38:17.295 --> 38:21.770
I PLAN ON SPENDING THE REST
OF MY LIFE MAKING IT UP TO YOU.

38:25.634 --> 38:28.807
MM.

38:28.807 --> 38:31.510
FIRST THING TOMORROW
I'M SELLING MY WATCH

38:31.510 --> 38:35.614
SO I CAN BUY YOU SOME NEW SHOES
TO GO WITH THAT DRESS.

38:35.614 --> 38:37.516
YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT WATCH IS A KNOCKOFF.

38:37.516 --> 38:40.819
I SOLD THE REAL ONE TWO YEARS
AGO TO GET THE ROOF FIXED.

38:45.023 --> 38:47.526
SO HOW IS KATHERINE'S FOOT?

38:47.526 --> 38:50.559
WELL, SHE'S KINDA GOT
A PSYCHEDELIC TOENAIL,

38:50.559 --> 38:54.403
BUT SHE'LL BE FINE...

38:54.403 --> 38:57.566
WHICH DOESN'T EXCUSE
WHAT YOU DID, MISTER.

38:57.566 --> 38:59.468
WHAT'S GOING ON?

38:59.468 --> 39:01.540
SWEETIE, IF YOU'RE WORRIED
THAT I DON'T LIKE

39:01.540 --> 39:04.042
YOUR DADDY SPENDING TIME
WITH KATHERINE, DON'T BE.

39:04.042 --> 39:05.644
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

39:05.644 --> 39:09.047
BUT THEY CAN'T BE TOGETHER.

39:09.047 --> 39:10.879
WHY NOT?

39:10.879 --> 39:14.823
'CAUSE YOU AND MOMMY ARE
GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

39:14.823 --> 39:16.555
WHAT?

39:16.555 --> 39:19.488
THAT'S WHAT MOMMY SAID.

39:21.830 --> 39:24.362
UM...
HEY, I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

39:24.362 --> 39:28.397
WHY DON'T YOU GO MAKE A GET WELL
CARD FOR KATHERINE'S FOOT?

39:28.397 --> 39:29.498
OKAY.

39:29.498 --> 39:30.639
OKAY.

39:36.405 --> 39:38.447
I CAN TOTALLY EXPLAIN THIS.
I SWEAR.

39:38.447 --> 39:40.378
I'M LISTENING.

39:40.378 --> 39:43.952
IT WAS--I DON'T KNOW, UH, ABOUT
A MONTH AFTER YOU MOVED OUT.

39:43.952 --> 39:45.654
IT WAS BEDTIME.

39:45.654 --> 39:48.657
I WAS TRYING TO READ TO HIM,
BUT HE ONLY WANTED YOU.

39:48.657 --> 39:51.490
AND HE WAS CRYING SO HARD,

39:51.490 --> 39:54.493
AND HE KEPT ASKING ME
IF YOU WERE EVER COMING BACK,

39:54.493 --> 39:56.965
AND SO I FINALLY...

39:56.965 --> 39:58.997
SAID MAYBE YOU WOULD.

39:58.997 --> 40:02.571
I JUST DIDN'T WANT HIM
TO BE SO SAD.

40:02.571 --> 40:05.604
OH, SUSAN.
 I DIDN'T EVEN THINK
HE'D REMEMBERED IT.

40:05.604 --> 40:09.538
OF COURSE HE REMEMBERS IT.
HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT TO HIM?

40:12.641 --> 40:15.514
BECAUSE WE HAVE
NEVER SAID IT.

40:15.514 --> 40:17.185
WHAT?

40:17.185 --> 40:19.688
WE'VE NEVER LOOKED EACH OTHER
IN THE EYE

40:19.688 --> 40:21.690
AND SAID THAT
THERE IS NO CHANCE

40:21.690 --> 40:25.123
WE ARE EVER
GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

40:25.123 --> 40:26.795
O-OKAY.

40:26.795 --> 40:29.858
MAYBE WE HAVEN'T,
BUT WE MOVED ON.

40:29.858 --> 40:31.600
DID WE?

40:31.600 --> 40:33.562
SUSAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

40:33.562 --> 40:36.434
YOU'RE WITH JACKSON NOW.
I'M WITH KATHERINE.

40:37.936 --> 40:40.038
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

40:40.038 --> 40:43.612
I DON'T KNOW. I...

40:46.545 --> 40:48.577
YOU DON'T EVER THINK
ABOUT IT?

40:48.577 --> 40:52.020
(sighs)

41:02.591 --> 41:05.564
I'VE GOTTA GO CHECK
ON KATHERINE.

41:08.997 --> 41:10.839
(door shuts)

41:10.839 --> 41:12.541
(sighs)

41:18.076 --> 41:21.980
IT'S AN AWFUL THING
TO LIVE IN DARKNESS,

41:21.980 --> 41:26.555
UNABLE TO SEE
WHAT OTHERS TAKE FOR GRANTED.

41:26.555 --> 41:30.819
BUT IF WE ARE LUCKY,
THE DARKNESS LIFTS

41:30.819 --> 41:32.821
AND WE CAN FINALLY SEE

41:32.821 --> 41:37.726
THE SECRET SACRIFICES MADE
BY OUR WIVES...

41:39.928 --> 41:45.173
THE SURPRISING PROGRESS MADE
BY OUR MOTHERS...

41:45.173 --> 41:49.638
OR THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

41:49.638 --> 41:52.811
OF OUR OWN ACTIONS.

41:52.811 --> 41:57.646
BUT THERE ARE THOSE
WHO PREFER THE DARKNESS,

41:57.646 --> 42:02.551
BECAUSE THERE, THEY SEE
ONLY WHAT THEY CHOOSE TO SEE.

42:02.551 --> 42:04.853
(voice breaking)
I KNOW IT MUST SEEM LIKE

42:04.853 --> 42:07.095
I'VE FORGOTTEN ABOUT YOU,

42:07.095 --> 42:11.600
BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW,
I THINK ABOUT YOU EVERY DAY.

42:11.600 --> 42:15.704
I LIVE FOR YOU,
JUST LIKE ALWAYS.

42:15.704 --> 42:18.667
BUT I HAVE A PLAN,

42:18.667 --> 42:21.970
SO I HOPE YOU CAN WAIT
A LITTLE LONGER.

42:21.970 --> 42:24.613
I'LL BE WITH YOU SOON,

42:24.613 --> 42:27.946
BUT FIRST
MIKE DELFINO HAS TO PAY

42:27.946 --> 42:29.948
FOR TAKING YOU AWAY FROM ME,

42:29.948 --> 42:34.222
AND I NEED JUST THE RIGHT MOMENT
TO DO IT.

42:34.222 --> 42:37.856
HE DESTROYED
WHAT I LOVED THE MOST,

42:37.856 --> 42:41.059
AND I WANT HIM
TO FEEL THAT HURT.

42:41.059 --> 42:45.233
I WANT HIM TO LOSE WHAT I LOST.
