Previously on Medium:

00:02.110 --> 00:02.790
Who's that?

00:02.800 --> 00:06.090
Terry Kavanaugh! The John D.
Rockefeller of solar energy.

00:06.100 --> 00:07.130
It's from Meghan.

00:07.140 --> 00:08.910
What is she doing, buying you a robe?

00:08.920 --> 00:09.800
I don't know.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.260
There's nothing going on!

00:11.270 --> 00:12.650
The other night,I'm
working in my office.

00:12.660 --> 00:14.800
She walks in, she's
all drunk off her ass...

00:14.830 --> 00:18.280
I know! I already
dreamt it! I saw it all!

00:18.290 --> 00:19.760
You did? Then why didn't you tell me?

00:19.770 --> 00:22.550
No! That is not the question.

00:22.560 --> 00:27.540
The question is, why didn't you tell me?

00:27.560 --> 00:31.130
I'm going to go in there in the morning.
I'm going to tell her there's no company.

00:34.540 --> 00:36.970
Are you insane?

00:38.830 --> 00:39.940
this is going to work.

00:39.950 --> 00:41.220
You're going to give me my idea back.

00:41.230 --> 00:43.240
We're going to close down this business.

00:43.250 --> 00:45.390
Do you understand?

00:45.400 --> 00:47.630
I'm sorry.

02:04.930 --> 02:06.960
Manuel. Thank you.

02:06.970 --> 02:10.370
I appreciate you coming
over at this very early hour.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.670
Why all the drama,Tom?
It's 7:00 in the morning.

02:12.680 --> 02:16.260
- I have a campaign to run, a practice to tend to.
- No. I know.

02:18.380 --> 02:24.500
I have a friend, just discovered he's got
a fairly advanced case of prostate cancer.

02:25.540 --> 02:30.460
And he asked me if I knew of any attorneys in town who
could be trusted to do a bunch of probate work quickly.

02:30.470 --> 02:33.110
Wants to make sure his,um...

02:33.120 --> 02:34.730
his family's taken care of.

02:38.690 --> 02:40.790
So,how are you going to do it?

02:40.800 --> 02:44.350
I don't know. I mean,I've
been thinking about that.

02:45.970 --> 02:48.090
I think I just have to tell
her and take my chances.

02:48.100 --> 02:50.100
I think so,too.

02:52.330 --> 02:54.350
- Hello?
- Hello.

02:54.360 --> 02:55.560
My name's Charles Winters.

02:55.570 --> 02:57.910
I'm a tax attorney over
at Phelps and Kingman.

02:57.920 --> 02:59.400
I'm looking for Allison Dubois.

02:59.410 --> 03:01.420
Well,this is Allison Dubois.

03:01.430 --> 03:03.070
I got your number from Larry Watt.

03:03.090 --> 03:07.510
He indicated that he had hired you on a
freelance basis a couple of months back,

03:07.520 --> 03:10.800
and I was wondering if I might
be able to do the same thing.

03:14.840 --> 03:16.490
I see you got my text.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.870
Okay. So what's all
the excitement about?

03:22.950 --> 03:26.280
Oh,my gosh. It's the end
of the world as we know it.

03:28.210 --> 03:31.120
Mr. Winters? This is Mrs. Dubois.

03:31.130 --> 03:32.680
Thanks.

03:32.930 --> 03:36.750
thank you for coming in.
I'm Charles Winters. Please.

03:40.160 --> 03:44.140
Uh,well,frankly, I'm a little puzzled.

03:44.150 --> 03:47.200
You mentioned on the phone
that you were a tax attorney?

03:48.140 --> 03:52.590
The work that I've done with Larry Watt and
former District Attorney Devalos is,uh...

03:52.600 --> 03:55.130
Almost all of it was
of a criminal nature.

03:55.140 --> 03:58.190
Actually,I'm not interested in hiring
you to help me with a professional matter.

03:58.200 --> 04:01.500
It's about my wife.

04:01.510 --> 04:05.500
Uh,my... house... really.

04:07.510 --> 04:10.080
She thinks it's haunted.

04:10.090 --> 04:13.320
This is great that you've
actually got the time to do this.

04:13.330 --> 04:17.320
Kelly is going to be
thrilled. She loves this house.

04:17.329 --> 04:20.200
I mean,she's actually the
one who found it. She,um...

04:20.209 --> 04:24.000
I mean... It actually
wasn't even for sale.

04:24.010 --> 04:26.800
Took me days to convince
the people that owned it,

04:26.810 --> 04:30.150
and the truth is,we
paid too much for it.

04:31.090 --> 04:33.960
You must really love your wife.

04:34.620 --> 04:36.870
I do. Yeah.

04:37.170 --> 04:40.940
That's why I can't stand
to see her like this.

04:40.950 --> 04:46.480
I've got clients all over the Southwest,
and when I have to be gone overnight...

04:47.590 --> 04:49.300
What?

04:49.760 --> 04:52.260
She hears things.

04:52.270 --> 04:54.090
What kind of things?

04:54.100 --> 04:56.070
Water.

04:56.080 --> 04:59.250
She hears water... running.

04:59.260 --> 05:02.820
And then sometimes, she hears crying.

05:03.130 --> 05:05.420
A baby crying.

05:05.710 --> 05:09.170
But you never hear it? It
never happens when you're there?

05:09.180 --> 05:15.420
I'm just hoping that if you say there
are no ghosts, there can be no baby...

05:16.560 --> 05:19.930
there can be no water, then...

05:20.720 --> 05:22.810
there won't be.

05:26.390 --> 05:32.130
hey partner, yohoo! I'm back!

05:32.140 --> 05:34.370
Oh,good. You got it.

05:34.380 --> 05:36.870
I was worried when I
didn't hear from you.

05:36.880 --> 05:40.340
Does it fit? Of course
it fits. It's a robe.

05:42.020 --> 05:42.990
You know what?

05:43.000 --> 05:45.880
Give me five minutes to settle
in, and then come into my office.

05:45.890 --> 05:47.400
I'll fill you in on everything.

05:47.410 --> 05:50.790
God,it is good to be back.

05:57.250 --> 06:02.390
Why would you send me
a $2,200 cashmere robe?

06:02.960 --> 06:04.590
I don't know. I-I just...

06:04.600 --> 06:07.190
I didn't really want to have
to carry it on the plane.

06:07.210 --> 06:08.460
That's not what I mean.

06:08.470 --> 06:11.160
You know that's not what I mean.

06:11.170 --> 06:13.670
No,I don't. What do you mean?

06:13.680 --> 06:19.420
I mean,it's a robe. It's
intimate. And that card.

06:19.430 --> 06:20.810
What about the card?

06:20.820 --> 06:22.280
I thought it was a lovely card.

06:22.290 --> 06:23.670
You didn't like the card?

06:23.680 --> 06:25.420
After the other night?
After the promises you made?

06:25.430 --> 06:27.400
No,I didn't like the card.

06:27.420 --> 06:29.690
I didn't like the card.
I don't like the robe.

06:29.700 --> 06:31.210
My wife doesn't like the robe.

06:31.220 --> 06:33.340
Whoa,whoa,whoa,wait a second.

06:33.350 --> 06:36.100
Your wife has a problem with the robe?

06:36.110 --> 06:40.100
I think we're all having a
gigantic misunderstanding here.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.640
It's a robe. It's cashmere.

06:42.650 --> 06:44.350
It's a luxury item.

06:44.360 --> 06:48.490
It speaks to the fact that I believe you and
I are going to make a lot of money together.

06:48.500 --> 06:49.840
That's all it is.

06:49.850 --> 06:53.390
It's not like I bought
you silk underwear.

06:53.400 --> 06:56.190
You know what? I need to call your wife.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.840
I need to straighten this out.

06:57.850 --> 07:01.060
You don't need to call
anyone. You've said enough.

07:01.070 --> 07:03.680
You've written enough.
You've done enough.

07:03.690 --> 07:06.780
Listen to me,Meghan. I'm done.

07:06.790 --> 07:11.090
I'm dissolving the business. I'm
taking my marbles. I'm going home.

07:17.950 --> 07:20.540
- No.
- No what?

07:20.550 --> 07:22.640
No,you are not dissolving the business.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.990
It is not your business to dissolve.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.010
I own 51% of it.

07:27.020 --> 07:29.110
I own 51% of you.

07:29.120 --> 07:31.920
So,give me the freaking
robe. I'll take it back.

07:31.930 --> 07:36.700
I'll send your wife some flowers, and let's
get back to doing what we know we have to do.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.840
Excuse me.

07:39.850 --> 07:42.130
Where do you think you're going?

07:42.140 --> 07:45.490
Don't worry. You'll be
hearing from me again.

07:50.020 --> 07:51.910
There he is.

07:52.740 --> 07:54.240
Lynn.

07:54.710 --> 07:56.520
Good to see you.

07:57.610 --> 07:59.090
Lee.

07:59.100 --> 08:01.260
Okay,enough small talk.

08:01.270 --> 08:02.390
What the hell was going on over there?

08:02.400 --> 08:05.370
We saw you cavorting with that weasel.

08:09.630 --> 08:12.180
He's dying.

08:12.190 --> 08:14.430
- Are you serious?
- Oh,my God.

08:15.640 --> 08:17.830
Okay. I feel horrible,
but you guys were laughing.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.180
You both looked so happy.

08:19.190 --> 08:22.120
We've known each other a long time.

08:23.310 --> 08:25.400
He,the mayor,
the governor--

08:25.410 --> 08:30.400
they all want me to step in,
finish out my current term.

08:30.420 --> 08:35.480
Obviously,Tom's gonna withdraw his
candidacy, and I'll end up running unopposed.

08:36.030 --> 08:38.840
I haven't even had a chance
to call and tell Lily.

08:38.850 --> 08:40.860
Well,congratulations...

08:40.870 --> 08:42.770
- I guess.
- Yeah.

08:43.370 --> 08:45.860
I know exactly what you mean.

08:47.590 --> 08:48.890
Do you want to hear something strange?

08:48.900 --> 08:52.610
Absolutely. That's what we're all starved
for around here is something strange.

08:52.620 --> 08:55.300
He wants to meet with Allison Dubois.

08:55.310 --> 08:59.600
He said he'd consider it a personal favor if I'd
intercede and help smooth things over with her,

08:59.610 --> 09:02.180
get her to meet with him.

09:02.190 --> 09:06.810
It usually starts around 10:00, just after
I've gone to bed, once the house is dark,

09:06.820 --> 09:09.930
and only if I'm alone.

09:13.990 --> 09:17.970
It goes on for about an
hour, and then it stops.

09:18.630 --> 09:21.020
I know it's impossible.

09:21.030 --> 09:24.200
The man Charles hired showed me that
there weren't any water pipes in that wall,

09:24.220 --> 09:27.120
so,that's weird.

09:27.140 --> 09:29.420
But,uh,it's still just
the sound of water.

09:29.440 --> 09:32.080
It doesn't frighten me that much.

09:32.380 --> 09:35.530
But when the baby cries...

09:35.550 --> 09:39.130
He sounds so frightened and unhappy.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.740
Isn't that tile awful?

09:47.750 --> 09:49.570
I'm sure we'll never have
the money to replace it.

09:49.580 --> 09:53.160
We're in so much debt now, and there
are so many things we want to do.

09:59.240 --> 10:01.960
Your house is really beautiful.

10:01.970 --> 10:04.710
Very lovely.

10:04.930 --> 10:07.450
Uh,so I'm curious.

10:07.470 --> 10:10.870
I think we're both curious.
Any first impressions?

10:10.880 --> 10:14.270
Anything you want to share?

10:15.260 --> 10:18.760
Uh,well, you have a beautiful home.

10:18.770 --> 10:21.070
A very lovely home.

10:21.080 --> 10:24.890
Um,other than that, I-I'm
sorry to say that I don't...

10:24.900 --> 10:27.800
I don't see anything.

10:27.810 --> 10:30.170
I don't sense anything.

10:30.180 --> 10:32.420
You know,of course,it's
the middle of the day.

10:32.430 --> 10:36.230
And obviously,you're not
here by yourself,so...

10:36.240 --> 10:38.680
You know,it doesn't make you wrong.

10:38.690 --> 10:42.500
It doesn't make me right.
It's just a first impression.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.140
I called seven lawyers.

10:46.150 --> 10:48.800
I left messages,haven't
heard back from a single one.

10:48.820 --> 10:51.670
Well,that's okay. I'm loaded.

10:51.680 --> 10:53.910
I made $300 today,

10:53.920 --> 10:58.580
explaining in the nicest way possible to
this attorney's wife that in all likelihood--

10:58.590 --> 11:00.820
even though she hears
noises in her house--

11:00.840 --> 11:03.750
that her house is almost
certainly not haunted.

11:03.770 --> 11:06.180
Well,that probably made her feel better.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.520
I don't know.

11:07.530 --> 11:10.940
You should have seen the look
on her face when I told her.

11:10.950 --> 11:15.260
I'm afraid that all I did was
convince her that she's crazy.

11:33.820 --> 11:35.570
There,there.

11:37.090 --> 11:40.880
it's all right. Mommy's got you.

11:41.990 --> 11:44.220
It's all right.

11:47.900 --> 11:51.800
Okay. It's going to be all right.

11:56.140 --> 12:01.600
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

12:20.010 --> 12:21.640
Hello.

12:24.640 --> 12:25.440
Hey,sorry.

12:25.450 --> 12:28.600
I tried to get to it before it
woke you,but you beat me to it.

12:28.610 --> 12:29.650
Was it for me?

12:29.660 --> 12:34.030
No,it was your friendly neighborhood
she-devil-- Meghan Doyle.

12:34.720 --> 12:37.200
She's having some papers drawn up.

12:37.210 --> 12:40.250
She wants to show them to me at 11:30.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.600
Dissolution papers,right?

12:41.620 --> 12:43.150
Papers to end the company?

12:43.160 --> 12:46.290
Yeah,I can only assume so.

12:46.700 --> 12:49.010
What are you working on
so furiously over here?

12:49.020 --> 12:52.850
Well,you're going to find this hard to
believe, but I had a dream last night.

12:54.560 --> 12:57.250
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- That's okay.

12:58.890 --> 13:02.200
I know that I told you yesterday
I didn't see anything in your house

13:02.210 --> 13:05.300
and I didn't feel
anything in your house.

13:05.890 --> 13:11.270
Well,last night I had a dream and it
seemed to take place in your house.

13:11.280 --> 13:15.170
It was a long time
ago-- 20 years or so.

13:15.180 --> 13:19.390
So I woke up this morning,
and I,I went on the Internet.

13:19.400 --> 13:22.730
It didn't take me
terribly long to find this.

13:26.900 --> 13:29.120
Oh,my God.

13:29.130 --> 13:31.910
A little boy died in our house.

13:31.920 --> 13:34.920
Drowned by accident.

13:34.930 --> 13:40.110
The version of events I saw last
night was somewhat more... violent.

13:43.440 --> 13:46.160
Jonathan McKenzie.

13:46.500 --> 13:50.880
His mother was distracted by the
television and he drowned in the bathtub.

13:54.460 --> 13:58.480
Do you think that's
why I hear what I hear?

13:59.490 --> 14:02.180
I can't answer that.

14:02.860 --> 14:06.720
It may be that you're a little like me,

14:06.730 --> 14:10.260
that you have...sensitivities.

14:12.280 --> 14:16.230
Sensitive... not crazy.

14:17.070 --> 14:20.710
Sensitive. I like that.

14:20.720 --> 14:23.440
If you'll excuse me for a moment.

14:26.500 --> 14:30.570
Like I said, it took me about ten
minutes to come across these stories.

14:30.590 --> 14:33.250
Mr. Winters, you're a lawyer.

14:33.270 --> 14:36.150
Surely you were aware of this.

14:37.400 --> 14:41.150
Not when we bought the house.

14:41.920 --> 14:46.750
After she started hearing
things,sure, I did some research.

14:46.760 --> 14:49.140
- I found what you found.
- And you didn't tell her?

14:49.150 --> 14:51.520
Tell her what?

14:51.530 --> 14:55.770
That we just sunk our life savings--
more than our life savings--

14:55.780 --> 14:57.540
into a house where
someone had an accident?

14:57.550 --> 15:01.510
No,I didn't tell her that.

15:02.420 --> 15:05.960
I don't believe in ghosts.

15:05.980 --> 15:08.280
I don't think that our
place is really haunted,

15:08.290 --> 15:12.030
but I do believe in
the power of suggestion,

15:12.040 --> 15:15.630
and I honestly thought that you
would come over, look around,

15:15.640 --> 15:20.420
and say either we were poltergeist-free
or chant some mumbo jumbo

15:20.430 --> 15:22.130
and she would believe that we were.

15:22.140 --> 15:24.730
Well,sorry I let you down.

15:24.740 --> 15:28.450
You have no idea the can of
worms that you have just opened.

15:28.460 --> 15:29.440
She is going to want to move now.

15:29.450 --> 15:31.540
She is going to want to sell
and we cannot afford to do that.

15:31.550 --> 15:33.770
You are talking about
your wife's peace of mind.

15:33.780 --> 15:37.470
Can you really afford
not to,Mr. Winters?

15:38.760 --> 15:41.410
You two have a lot to talk about.

15:50.060 --> 15:51.940
Boy,you don't waste any time.

15:51.960 --> 15:53.460
Come in.

15:55.760 --> 16:01.000
is that I'm surrendering all my
rights to,to everything,right?

16:01.010 --> 16:07.750
It says you're divesting your
49% ownership in Dubois-Doyle,yes.

16:09.130 --> 16:11.210
This wasn't my idea.

16:11.230 --> 16:14.770
This is not something I want.

16:16.510 --> 16:18.070
Wait a second. What's this?

16:18.080 --> 16:19.230
What's what?

16:19.240 --> 16:22.070
It says something about a
quarter of a million dollars.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.830
Does this say that I owe you
a quarter of a million dollars?

16:24.840 --> 16:26.280
No.

16:26.290 --> 16:30.400
It says upon the tender of your signature--
as soon as you sign these papers--

16:30.410 --> 16:34.850
I'm giving you a quarter
of a million dollars.

16:34.860 --> 16:37.900
Why would you do that?

16:39.970 --> 16:44.680
I promised you I'd invest
$300,000 in your idea,Joe.

16:44.690 --> 16:49.470
Between the office, our
expenses,the models, our travel,

16:49.950 --> 16:51.670
you do the math.

16:51.680 --> 16:54.050
A quarter of a million dollars?

16:54.060 --> 16:58.680
That's what it says. I've reread that page
of the agreement 16 times.

17:03.200 --> 17:04.940
And she's going to
give that money to you?

17:04.950 --> 17:06.290
To us,yeah.

17:06.300 --> 17:10.200
Well,I mean,in return for signing this
agreement, in return for signing over everything.

17:10.210 --> 17:12.450
I mean,I don't get
anything until I sign.

17:12.460 --> 17:14.339
But you are going to sign it?

17:14.349 --> 17:18.280
Of course I am. It's just... do
you think maybe we misjudged her?

17:18.290 --> 17:19.640
What?

17:19.650 --> 17:22.000
Let me think about that a minute. No.

17:22.900 --> 17:27.400
She is paying you that money 'cause she's betting
she's going to make a lot more money down the road.

17:27.410 --> 17:29.030
Yeah,of course,you're right.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.380
Which is the other reason I called.

17:30.390 --> 17:32.110
You want to go out
and celebrate tonight?

17:32.120 --> 17:37.870
Oh,I would love to, but Devalos just called me and
asked me to meet him at Tom Van Dyke's office at 7:00,

17:37.880 --> 17:40.830
but I-I could call him
and try to reschedule.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.420
Don't you think we should wait
till we really have the money?

17:44.430 --> 17:46.320
Hmm,that's awfully
damn adult of you,dear.

17:47.390 --> 17:51.510
Sorry,I didn't mean to be
so "awfully damn adult."

17:53.150 --> 17:55.570
They gave him his job back.

17:56.040 --> 17:58.180
That's amazing.

17:58.190 --> 18:00.030
Does that mean that
you get your job back?

18:00.040 --> 18:03.000
As soon as I want.

18:04.100 --> 18:07.760
It's so weird how things work.

18:07.770 --> 18:12.020
I mean,you think you know the course
of things, how things are going to go.

18:12.490 --> 18:15.960
Well,you got to feel bad for Van Dyke.

18:16.210 --> 18:19.540
He wants me to meet with him.
Although I'm not sure why.

18:20.820 --> 18:24.040
So where are we going to go
celebrate tomorrow,rich guy?

18:24.460 --> 18:26.560
What makes you think we're
going to get the money tomorrow?

18:26.580 --> 18:28.210
Well,did you check all the papers?

18:28.220 --> 18:30.150
Yeah,only about a hundred times.

18:30.160 --> 18:33.470
Does your right hand work,yeah?

18:35.360 --> 18:38.070
So where are we going
to celebrate tomorrow?

18:38.080 --> 18:41.570
Tell me again why we got
to wait till tomorrow.

18:49.410 --> 18:50.260
Hello.

18:50.270 --> 18:52.500
Allison,it's Lee.Sorry to call so late,

18:52.510 --> 18:55.930
but I was summoned over here
to a house on Fremont Lane.

18:55.950 --> 18:59.450
Apparently,you know these people. I was
talking to the husband. He mentioned your name.

18:59.460 --> 19:02.200
Wait,I was half asleep.

19:02.210 --> 19:03.840
Where are you? What's going on?

19:03.850 --> 19:07.320
The Winters' home--
Charles and Kelly Winters.

19:07.330 --> 19:11.370
About an hour and a half ago, Kelly Winters
swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills,

19:11.380 --> 19:15.310
***hot bath. And killed herself.

19:16.010 --> 19:19.100
YOUNG BRIDE TAKES OWN
LIFE IN CURSED HOUSE

19:20.030 --> 19:23.020
Kids are safely ensconced in school,

19:23.320 --> 19:25.910
and I just got off the
phone with Meghan Doyle.

19:25.920 --> 19:29.490
She wants to sign the
papers today at The Belmont.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.990
This was in with the mail.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.680
Somebody must have just
put it in the mailbox.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.130
Been waiting an hour and 20 minutes.

19:45.140 --> 19:47.250
- What the hell do you think is taking 'em so long?
- Dad...

19:47.260 --> 19:48.760
You sure you don't want a lawyer?

19:48.770 --> 19:50.680
Because I know I can get your
mother to pay for a lawyer.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.980
I don't need a lawyer. They just
want to ask me some questions.

19:54.770 --> 19:56.600
Mr. Winters.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.550
- This your attorney?
- I'm Sam Winters. I'm Charles' father.

19:59.560 --> 20:01.400
I'm down here helping
my son with the funeral.

20:01.410 --> 20:04.090
Well,it's nice to meet you,sir, but I'm
going to need you to wait outside here

20:04.100 --> 20:06.540
while we talk to your son.

20:07.560 --> 20:12.170
She said she wouldn't live in
a house where a child had died.

20:12.180 --> 20:15.840
She couldn't bear to
hear him cry anymore.

20:15.850 --> 20:16.600
I don't understand.

20:16.610 --> 20:19.760
Why not just put the house on the
market, find another place to live?

20:19.770 --> 20:24.710
I know. That's,that's what Kelly
wanted to do, but it's not that easy.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.800
We overpaid.

20:26.810 --> 20:28.910
The market is down.

20:28.920 --> 20:31.490
I just... I honestly... I couldn't...

20:31.990 --> 20:34.750
see how that it was possible or,

20:34.760 --> 20:39.430
or really why it was even necessary,

20:39.440 --> 20:42.810
and we had a really big fight about it.

20:42.820 --> 20:45.130
So she went on a drive.

20:45.140 --> 20:46.890
What'd you do while she was gone?

20:46.900 --> 20:52.090
I had a couple of scotches
and fell asleep on the couch.

20:53.770 --> 20:56.740
Then when I woke up,

20:56.750 --> 21:01.960
I could hear the sound of water,
an-and I-I thought it was a joke.

21:04.360 --> 21:07.750
When I walked into the bathroom,I...

21:08.990 --> 21:11.830
She was so still. She...

21:13.550 --> 21:17.530
I loved her so much.

21:19.780 --> 21:21.840
Mr. Winters,while you were
sitting out there waiting for us,

21:21.850 --> 21:24.650
I went ahead and got a
warrant to search your home.

21:24.660 --> 21:27.910
We looked in the attic above
the bedroom and found this.

21:28.170 --> 21:29.710
What is that?

21:29.720 --> 21:31.100
It's a white noise machine.

21:31.110 --> 21:32.600
It helps people fall asleep.

21:32.610 --> 21:35.440
It makes sounds like a
babbling brook or an ocean.

21:35.450 --> 21:36.960
Even has a convenient timer on the back,

21:36.980 --> 21:41.270
so if you were going out of town you could
set it to go off in the middle of the night.

21:41.280 --> 21:45.740
Mr. Winters, could you take a look at this
and tell me if you recognize the handwriting.

21:45.750 --> 21:48.390
What is this?

21:49.030 --> 21:51.780
This is Kelly's handwriting.
Where did you get this?

21:51.790 --> 21:53.810
I found it in my mailbox this morning.

21:53.820 --> 21:57.790
I'm guessing Kelly left it there last
night when she went for that drive.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.240
The letter's pretty clear,Mr. Winters.

21:59.250 --> 22:02.220
Your wife believed you
meant to do her harm.

22:02.570 --> 22:04.550
What?

22:05.800 --> 22:10.180
She writes if anything happens to her, anything
at all, we should look very closely at you.

22:10.190 --> 22:13.260
In fact, she specifically
says that she's not suicidal.

22:13.270 --> 22:16.000
What-what-what are...
what are you saying?

22:16.010 --> 22:17.610
I don't...

22:17.620 --> 22:22.060
believe that you're saying
that I murdered my wife

22:22.070 --> 22:24.100
and then I made it look
like it was a suicide.

22:24.110 --> 22:25.880
We aren't saying it,Charles.

22:25.900 --> 22:27.560
Kelly is.

22:27.570 --> 22:29.660
Mr. Winters,you have the
right to remain silent.

22:29.670 --> 22:33.120
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

22:33.130 --> 22:34.980
You have the right to an attorney.

22:34.990 --> 22:38.360
If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed for you.

22:46.300 --> 22:49.230
Thank you,Joe.

22:49.240 --> 22:50.800
And thank you.

22:50.820 --> 22:56.510
I'm sorry things didn't work out the way you
hoped, but at least this way it's not a total loss.

22:56.520 --> 23:01.880
You know,I have to tell you,I
completely regret leaving my idea behind.

23:02.720 --> 23:05.920
Um,and there were times when we
were working together that I,uh,

23:05.930 --> 23:10.270
I actually, I literally
wanted to kill you.

23:11.740 --> 23:15.040
But this is actually
extraordinarily decent of you.

23:15.050 --> 23:17.050
And I know that we're probably
never gonna see each other again,

23:17.060 --> 23:21.640
but I just want you to know that I think
that you're basically a good person,Meghan.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.750
And I too regret that
things didn't work out.

23:24.760 --> 23:27.760
Oh,Joe...

23:27.770 --> 23:29.930
I can't believe you said that.

23:29.950 --> 23:31.510
I can't believe you think that.

23:31.530 --> 23:34.580
I mean I think that you tried your best.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.180
You are a lovely man.

23:36.200 --> 23:39.870
And I am happy that
check makes you so happy.

23:39.880 --> 23:44.860
But,Joe... God,you're
smart, and God,you're thick.

23:45.220 --> 23:47.020
Excuse me?

23:53.050 --> 23:54.980
Who is that?

23:54.990 --> 23:57.470
That's my smart,but thick.

23:57.480 --> 24:00.080
That's my husband. He's early.

24:00.090 --> 24:02.500
Your husband?

24:06.370 --> 24:08.030
Does he know about your boyfriend?

24:08.040 --> 24:10.180
Does he know what you tried with me?

24:10.770 --> 24:13.080
Joe.

24:13.090 --> 24:15.940
There was no boyfriend.
There was never a boyfriend.

24:15.950 --> 24:17.780
And don't hate me...

24:17.790 --> 24:20.990
but there were no patent
problems in Eastern Europe either.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.500
While you were sitting watching
the phone at the office,

24:24.510 --> 24:28.510
I was at home watching
DVDs with my husband.

24:28.520 --> 24:31.170
What are you talking about?

24:31.180 --> 24:33.130
I needed to make you uncomfortable.

24:33.140 --> 24:36.070
I needed to make you want to
sell me your half of the business.

24:36.080 --> 24:40.270
And now you have. And now
you're happy. And now I'm happy.

24:40.280 --> 24:42.540
It's how it had to be.

24:42.550 --> 24:45.320
We could have never worked
together. Not long-term.

24:45.330 --> 24:49.100
I mean... you're smart. And I'm smart.

24:49.110 --> 24:52.460
We're just different kinds of smart.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.790
Order a drink,Joe.

24:55.800 --> 24:59.930
Go ahead. Celebrate. I have a tab here.

24:59.940 --> 25:02.840
Order whatever you like.

25:03.740 --> 25:06.290
So I run to the bank. And
thank God the check cleared.

25:06.300 --> 25:08.550
But I can't help it.
My head is spinning.

25:08.560 --> 25:11.250
And I'm starting to feel like
the biggest fool on the planet.

25:11.260 --> 25:13.260
I think some of this might be my fault.

25:13.270 --> 25:15.380
I think maybe you
sensed my insecurities.

25:15.390 --> 25:18.500
- I think maybe she sensed my insecurities.
- No. No. No,it had nothing to do with you.

25:18.510 --> 25:21.830
She had a plan. She had
a plan from the beginning.

25:21.840 --> 25:26.420
So now,all I'm thinking of is that she was in Albuquerque
meeting for two days with that Terry Cavanaugh.

25:26.430 --> 25:30.580
And she probably sold him my idea
for ten times what she paid me.

25:30.610 --> 25:31.580
Oh,Joe.

25:31.590 --> 25:34.270
So I go home and I start
calling Stratosphere Aeronautics,

25:34.280 --> 25:36.410
and I'm asking to speak to
this Terry Cavanaugh guy.

25:36.420 --> 25:37.840
And of course they don't connect me.

25:37.860 --> 25:39.560
And then it hits me.

25:39.580 --> 25:44.630
I mean I just got paid a quarter of a million
dollars for my first independent invention.

25:44.640 --> 25:48.780
And I only had the damn
idea a whole two months ago.

25:48.790 --> 25:52.310
And now we're sitting on more money
than we've ever had in our entire lives.

25:52.330 --> 25:53.770
And I know we're not set.

25:53.780 --> 25:56.210
I mean,I know I still got to
go out there and get a job.

25:56.230 --> 25:59.210
But,I mean,it sure beats
working at the car wash.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.140
So you ready to go out and celebrate?

26:01.150 --> 26:03.590
Yes,I am.

26:23.190 --> 26:25.600
Is that you,baby?

26:26.180 --> 26:28.450
Are you hiding in there?

26:31.370 --> 26:34.020
It's only Mama.

26:34.030 --> 26:36.300
Don't be frightened.

26:36.700 --> 26:38.710
Baby?

26:39.530 --> 26:42.010
No! Mommy,please!

26:42.020 --> 26:46.040
Don't do this! Please! Don't do this!

26:46.050 --> 26:49.360
I'll do anything you want.

26:49.370 --> 26:53.350
There is nothing to
do! Do you understand?

26:53.360 --> 26:57.170
It is over for all of us.

26:58.530 --> 26:59.580
Not now. Go away!

26:59.590 --> 27:02.470
- Daddy!Daddy,help me.Please,Daddy!
- Kelly!

27:02.480 --> 27:05.120
Come back here! Kelly!

27:07.500 --> 27:10.480
Okay,so what you're
telling me is a little girl

27:10.490 --> 27:13.150
who lived in the Winters'
house 20 years ago...

27:13.160 --> 27:14.240
Kelly McKenzie.

27:14.250 --> 27:20.050
Kelly McKenzie has the same first
name as Charles Winters' late wife.

27:21.200 --> 27:22.190
Sorry,what does that prove?

27:22.200 --> 27:25.470
It doesn't prove
anything, but it is a fact.

27:25.480 --> 27:27.990
Now,what if they're the same person?

27:28.000 --> 27:31.330
It should be easy enough to check if
Charles's late wife's maiden is McKenzie.

27:31.350 --> 27:34.260
But it isn't. I mean, at least not
according to the death certificate.

27:34.270 --> 27:36.870
But maybe she changed it.

27:36.880 --> 27:38.250
Okay,I'll play.

27:38.260 --> 27:39.950
Let's pretend she changed it.

27:39.960 --> 27:41.710
I still don't see where we're going.

27:41.720 --> 27:43.990
Well,I'm not 100% sure on this either,

27:44.000 --> 27:47.160
but I keep dreaming about the
death of this little McKenzie boy.

27:47.170 --> 27:50.140
And the version that I see,
his death is no accident.

27:50.150 --> 27:52.780
His mother drowns him on purpose.

27:52.790 --> 27:55.960
And there's a little girl
there, a little girl named Kelly.

27:55.970 --> 27:58.320
And she sees it all.

27:58.330 --> 28:01.340
Well,I must be dreaming
this for a reason.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.570
Hello?

28:06.580 --> 28:08.970
This is Joe Dubois.

28:09.330 --> 28:11.580
Terry Cavanaugh?

28:13.770 --> 28:15.700
It's you.

28:16.180 --> 28:19.770
They said it was going to be someone
from the district attorney's office.

28:19.780 --> 28:23.310
As of today I'm with the
district attorney's office.

28:36.270 --> 28:38.780
You gotta laugh.

28:38.790 --> 28:43.780
I hired you to help calm my wife down and
now the city's hired you to help put me away.

28:43.790 --> 28:46.460
I'm not an attorney,Charles.

28:46.470 --> 28:49.970
The city's hired me to help them
figure out what really happened,

28:49.980 --> 28:53.070
which is why I wanted to talk to you.

28:53.080 --> 28:56.330
I have some... some hunches. Some ideas.

28:56.340 --> 28:58.520
But without knowing more about Kelly...

28:58.530 --> 29:00.520
they really don't make a lot of sense.

29:00.530 --> 29:01.750
Well,you better not ask me.

29:01.760 --> 29:07.410
Because,uh,when it comes to Kelly, I don't
think that I'm really the expert I thought I was.

29:10.260 --> 29:13.630
You know,I loved her...

29:13.640 --> 29:18.860
more than anyone or
anything I have ever loved.

29:19.870 --> 29:25.130
That... that... that letter,
it makes no sense to me.

29:27.730 --> 29:31.940
According to Kelly's death certificate,
it says that her maiden name is Anderson,

29:31.950 --> 29:33.450
that she was born in California.

29:33.460 --> 29:36.950
Do you have any reason
to suspect otherwise?

29:37.200 --> 29:39.170
What are you talking about?

29:39.180 --> 29:41.190
I don't know. Do you know
of any brothers or sisters?

29:41.200 --> 29:43.310
Have you ever met
anyone from her family?

29:43.320 --> 29:45.180
Her father? Her mother?

29:45.190 --> 29:49.920
No. No,there was no one else to meet.

29:49.930 --> 29:53.090
Growing up she said it was
just her and her crazy mother.

29:53.100 --> 29:55.270
Her mother's dead?

29:55.280 --> 29:57.260
Before I came along.

29:57.270 --> 30:00.330
And she referred to her as "crazy"?

30:01.470 --> 30:03.980
Yeah. We had bad parenting in common.

30:03.990 --> 30:06.150
Two crazy mothers. Two crappy fathers.

30:06.160 --> 30:07.860
Her dad was never around.

30:07.870 --> 30:13.550
My dad was practically a lap dog
because my mother had all the money.

30:13.560 --> 30:17.140
I guess you could say
that we bonded over that.

30:17.150 --> 30:20.230
And the two of you met how?

30:21.250 --> 30:24.400
Uh,she chose me.

30:24.410 --> 30:28.480
It was,uh, like a movie.

30:28.490 --> 30:31.670
The prettiest girl in the bar just
walks up and starts talking to me.

30:34.330 --> 30:35.890
Me.

30:38.580 --> 30:43.260
Oh,sorry to interrupt,Miss, but I'd ask
you not to continue questioning my son

30:43.270 --> 30:47.380
until he has a chance to confer
with his attorney here,Mr. Beverly.

30:47.390 --> 30:49.170
Mr. Beverly, my son,Charles.

30:49.190 --> 30:50.330
Charles.

30:50.350 --> 30:52.250
Have you out of here before you know it.

30:52.260 --> 30:55.070
I see Mom finally came through,huh?

30:55.910 --> 30:57.290
This is Allison Dubois.

30:57.300 --> 30:59.180
She's with the district
attorney's office.

30:59.190 --> 31:04.270
Allison,my dad and,apparently,
my new attorney.

31:04.280 --> 31:06.940
- Nice to meet you,Mr. Winters.
- Ms. Dubois.

31:07.410 --> 31:08.520
We're actually finished here.

31:08.530 --> 31:11.550
If you gentlemen would like
to use this room to chat.

31:11.560 --> 31:13.590
Great. Thank you.

31:18.780 --> 31:21.220
She was an odd girl, you know.

31:21.740 --> 31:23.850
I wouldn't put it past her...

31:23.860 --> 31:25.920
take her own life,
leave a note like that.

31:25.930 --> 31:28.340
- Dad!
- I'm just saying.

31:28.730 --> 31:30.060
You ever meet her?

31:30.070 --> 31:32.380
Yes. Briefly.

31:32.390 --> 31:37.050
Well,then you know. She was an odd girl.

31:37.830 --> 31:39.590
What's the motive?

31:39.600 --> 31:44.190
You know, they didn't own much of anything
other than the enormous debt on that house.

31:44.210 --> 31:46.990
They didn't have much life insurance.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.470
Uh,maybe,uh, he hated her?

31:49.490 --> 31:50.780
No,I don't get that.

31:50.790 --> 31:52.850
I,I never got that from him.

31:52.880 --> 31:55.290
I think he honestly loved her.

31:55.310 --> 31:58.940
And besides,you have to hate
somebody a lot to risk life in prison.

31:58.960 --> 32:01.240
All right,you win. He loved her.

32:01.250 --> 32:02.850
What's your theory?

32:02.860 --> 32:04.520
I don't have a theory.

32:04.530 --> 32:06.270
She simply committed suicide.

32:06.280 --> 32:11.590
She took a bunch of sleeping pills and let
herself to drown to death in the bathtub.

32:11.610 --> 32:14.000
And then wrote a letter
implicating her husband?

32:14.030 --> 32:15.870
Why? Did she hate him?

32:15.880 --> 32:17.480
No. I didn't get that either.

32:17.490 --> 32:19.770
None of it makes any sense...

32:19.780 --> 32:22.770
least of all, the dreams
that I keep having.

32:22.780 --> 32:23.740
Hey,you know what you need to do?

32:23.760 --> 32:27.360
You need to put it out of your mind
and you need to come help me pack.

32:28.020 --> 32:30.900
All right. Well,you met
this Terry Cavanaugh,right?

32:30.910 --> 32:32.550
Is he a suit guy?

32:32.560 --> 32:34.840
Yeah,he seems like a suit guy.

32:34.850 --> 32:37.160
And you don't know what
this meeting is about?

32:37.170 --> 32:38.060
I don't know. They just called.

32:38.070 --> 32:42.180
They said Terry Cavanaugh wanted to meet
with me tomorrow, and was I available?

32:42.560 --> 32:46.470
Um,they said there was going to be a
first-class ticket waiting for me at the airport

32:46.480 --> 32:49.360
and a car to pick me
up on the other end.

32:49.370 --> 32:51.090
You think it has something
to do with Meghan?

32:51.100 --> 32:54.900
I mean,isn't he the guy that she said was
going to invest all that money in your idea?

32:54.920 --> 32:56.700
Yeah,he certainly is.

32:56.720 --> 32:59.320
I don't know.Maybe he
needs a good engineer

32:59.330 --> 33:02.010
and heard from Meghan I'm out of work.

33:08.170 --> 33:09.210
Not now. Go away!

33:09.220 --> 33:13.370
- Daddy!Daddy,help me!Please,Daddy!
- Kelly!here!

33:13.380 --> 33:15.110
Kelly!

33:21.300 --> 33:23.810
Madeleine, what the
hell is going on here?

33:30.930 --> 33:32.250
Mr. Winters.

33:33.160 --> 33:35.670
I'm District Attorney Devalos.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.390
You've already met Detective
Scanlon, Mrs. Dubois.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.520
Appreciate you rushing down
here. Please,have a seat.

33:40.530 --> 33:42.270
Not at all. I'm glad I could do it.

33:42.280 --> 33:46.350
When you said that there might be some kind
of a deal you could offer my son Charles...

33:46.360 --> 33:49.860
The important thing is, we're starting
to buy into your theory,Mr. Winters:

33:49.870 --> 33:54.680
that she did it to herself, that she
left that letter to implicate Charles.

33:56.040 --> 33:58.110
Like I said...

33:58.130 --> 33:59.720
she was an odd girl.

33:59.730 --> 34:03.930
The key thing is,some new facts have come to
light that from our standpoint change everything.

34:03.940 --> 34:05.930
Terrific. What have you found out?

34:05.940 --> 34:08.370
SCANLON: First and foremost,
your daughter's maiden name.

34:08.380 --> 34:11.020
It was actually McKenzie
before she changed it.

34:11.040 --> 34:16.730
Or how about the fact that you are listed
as the father on her birth certificate?

34:19.210 --> 34:21.429
Mr. Winters...

34:21.440 --> 34:24.909
your son's wife was
your daughter,wasn't she?

34:30.070 --> 34:34.340
Ever since Kelly's death, we've been
struggling to find enough physical evidence

34:34.350 --> 34:40.239
to implicate your son or find a reason why his
wife would hate him enough to leave that letter.

34:40.260 --> 34:43.159
And frankly,we haven't
come up with either.

34:43.170 --> 34:45.210
And now I know why.

34:45.219 --> 34:47.300
She didn't really hate him.

34:47.310 --> 34:50.030
Of course,she didn't
really love him either.

34:50.040 --> 34:55.120
She just knew who he was, your son,

34:55.130 --> 35:00.070
a means to an end...and
that end was you.

35:01.210 --> 35:06.130
You have to understand, when
he first brought her home,

35:06.910 --> 35:09.240
I didn't recognize her.

35:09.250 --> 35:11.830
I hadn't seen Kelly...

35:11.850 --> 35:14.950
my Kelly,in 20 years.

35:14.960 --> 35:18.080
But then,when they bought
the house on Fremont,

35:18.100 --> 35:22.230
and Charles told me that she was
hearing a baby crying at night,I...

35:23.030 --> 35:25.600
I knew it must be her.

35:25.610 --> 35:28.640
She really was her mother's daughter.

35:28.650 --> 35:32.030
And you think that's why
Madeleine drowned your son?

35:32.040 --> 35:34.440
To punish you?

35:35.390 --> 35:37.820
Yep.

35:39.060 --> 35:40.750
Madeleine was my mistress.

35:40.760 --> 35:43.320
I was already married to
Charles' mother when I met her.

35:43.350 --> 35:47.970
I told her right up front that
I would never leave my family.

35:48.510 --> 35:50.680
I loved my wife.

35:50.700 --> 35:55.200
And when she began to suspect I was being
unfaithful, she gave me an ultimatum.

35:56.580 --> 36:00.200
So I gave one to Madeleine
and I told her it was over.

36:00.210 --> 36:02.000
That night I went to the house.

36:02.010 --> 36:07.600
I went there to say good-bye to the children
and to give Madeleine some money to start over.

36:09.790 --> 36:14.460
But when I got there, she
had already drowned Johnny.

36:14.940 --> 36:17.250
Tried to kill Kelly.

36:17.260 --> 36:20.970
So I told Madeleine to call the police
and tell them there had been an accident.

36:20.980 --> 36:26.550
By that time,whatever fever
had possessed her was gone.

36:26.560 --> 36:28.590
She didn't want to go to prison.

36:28.610 --> 36:31.560
She didn't want to hurt Kelly.

36:31.570 --> 36:34.610
And she didn't want anyone
to know what she had done.

36:34.620 --> 36:38.630
For once,we both wanted the same thing.

36:39.530 --> 36:42.990
I know I should have taken
Kelly with me that night.

36:43.010 --> 36:45.320
I know that.

36:45.990 --> 36:49.620
But that would have been the end
of my life with Charles' mother.

36:50.150 --> 36:53.020
The end of everything.

36:53.440 --> 36:57.170
Mr. Winters,I'm going to see
to it that Charles is released.

36:58.230 --> 37:01.400
I'm not certain that I can actually
charge you with a crime at this point,

37:01.410 --> 37:04.640
but you can be damn
sure I'm going to try.

37:05.000 --> 37:09.620
In the meantime, you're going to need to
tell your wife and your son the whole truth...

37:10.090 --> 37:14.520
and I suspect that's as fitting a way
as any for your punishment to begin.

37:19.590 --> 37:21.470
Thank you.

37:29.620 --> 37:32.710
Thank you for coming, Mr. Dubois.

37:32.720 --> 37:34.270
Very anxious to meet you again.

37:34.290 --> 37:37.560
Very anxious to look you in the eye.

37:42.630 --> 37:44.210
Sit down.

37:45.560 --> 37:48.790
You know, I bought your
company, bought your invention.

37:48.810 --> 37:50.590
I suspected you might have.

37:50.600 --> 37:53.900
I wanted to buy it the
day I met you in Phoenix.

37:53.920 --> 37:56.680
She wanted four million. I paid her two.

37:56.690 --> 37:58.280
How much did you end up with?

37:58.290 --> 38:00.150
A lot less than that.

38:00.160 --> 38:01.910
You hate her?

38:01.930 --> 38:04.890
I'm not inviting her
over for Thanksgiving.

38:04.900 --> 38:09.590
She's a bottom-feeder, a
matchmaker, an agent,a broker.

38:10.030 --> 38:12.710
Got 'em in every business.

38:12.720 --> 38:15.640
The only thing they're
good at is smelling money.

38:15.650 --> 38:20.930
The day you met her, the day you pitched your
idea to that firm she worked for, she called me.

38:20.940 --> 38:24.910
Said "I think I might have
something you'd be interested in."

38:24.920 --> 38:26.370
She was right.

38:26.380 --> 38:28.200
Well,good for her.

38:28.210 --> 38:32.390
She knew I'd be interested because I've spent
the last seven years developing a technology

38:32.400 --> 38:35.340
that's surprisingly similar.

38:35.370 --> 38:38.670
She knew I'd be interested because I'd want
to make sure yours never made it to market.

38:38.680 --> 38:41.790
She knew I'd pay to kill it.

38:41.800 --> 38:45.640
Sounds like the two of you
were meant for each other.

38:45.660 --> 38:50.020
Well,two days ago,I finally
looked at what I bought.

38:50.050 --> 38:53.980
Went through the drawings,
went through the specs.

38:54.190 --> 38:57.290
Mr. Dubois, I like
yours better than mine.

38:57.300 --> 39:00.550
Well,thank you... I guess.

39:02.640 --> 39:05.370
How'd you like to
finish what you started?

39:10.280 --> 39:11.850
You got a couple minutes?

39:11.880 --> 39:14.970
Maybe. I got to pick Joe up at
the airport in about an hour.

39:14.980 --> 39:16.950
This won't take that.

39:25.810 --> 39:28.260
Mr. Van Dyke.

39:29.440 --> 39:33.050
Just,uh,dropped by to say
good-bye to some folks. And I'm...

39:33.060 --> 39:36.680
grateful to have that
opportunity with you.

39:37.720 --> 39:41.440
I'm so sorry to hear about everything.

39:41.450 --> 39:45.480
I know I haven't been your greatest
supporter or your greatest ally around here,

39:45.500 --> 39:50.470
and,uh,I have no right
to ask for favors.

39:51.250 --> 39:57.460
And as you well know, I'm not even sure I
believe in what it is you claim you're able to do.

39:57.470 --> 39:59.980
What is it that you need,sir?

40:03.230 --> 40:05.280
My wife...

40:05.290 --> 40:07.120
my children...

40:07.130 --> 40:10.640
as you might imagine, they're
having a difficult time with this.

40:13.090 --> 40:16.370
After I'm gone...

40:18.290 --> 40:20.800
When I'm no longer here...

40:22.350 --> 40:24.490
I don't know how it works.

40:24.500 --> 40:27.990
I don't know what to tell you to do.

40:28.010 --> 40:31.520
But if what you want
is for me to see you...

40:31.540 --> 40:34.720
to tell your wife and
children that you're fine...

40:34.730 --> 40:36.970
I promise you...

40:37.000 --> 40:39.890
I will be on the lookout.

40:44.550 --> 40:47.360
You really can read minds,can't you?

40:52.510 --> 40:54.720
Thank you.

40:56.890 --> 40:58.960
Isn't this fun?

40:58.970 --> 41:02.350
And the later it gets, the funner it is.

41:02.840 --> 41:04.730
They're here! They're here!

41:04.740 --> 41:08.400
That's it! It's 9:30! You
guys are supposed to be in bed!

41:19.890 --> 41:23.410
I keep thinking it's this giant
cosmic joke, that I'm going to wake up,

41:23.420 --> 41:26.570
the last eight hours
never happened at all.

41:26.580 --> 41:28.810
And you're sure we don't have to move?

41:28.830 --> 41:31.060
He said do it in Phoenix.

41:31.080 --> 41:33.260
Do it where you live.

41:33.280 --> 41:37.460
Find some space, hire some
people, make me some money.

41:40.660 --> 41:44.110
Hey,should we tell the kids?
Should we wake the kids?

41:45.390 --> 41:47.270
let's not.

41:58.550 --> 41:59.810
Hey,Ariel,what's going on?

41:59.840 --> 42:01.810
I didn't hear them come in.

42:01.830 --> 42:04.210
How are we supposed to
get our good-night kisses?

42:04.230 --> 42:05.110
Yeah.

42:05.120 --> 42:07.070
I don't know what to tell you guys.

42:07.080 --> 42:08.620
They're still in the garage.

42:08.630 --> 42:10.790
Well,what do you think
they're doing out there?

42:10.800 --> 42:13.360
- Don't they know they have kids?
- Yeah?

42:13.700 --> 42:17.160
- That's it. I'm quitting this family.
- Yeah!
