One must show a certain level of dignity.

03:14.944 --> 03:16.613
Even in times of great strife.

03:18.281 --> 03:19.991
- Just made a mistake.

Please.

Put the cunt out of his misery.

Go on.

in the big old house

04:42.073 --> 04:44.284
He belonged to a
different generation to me

04:44.284 --> 04:46.494
and he saw the world
through a vintage lens.

04:47.495 --> 04:48.663
But there's a maternal feel

04:48.663 --> 04:50.581
about the home you were raised in

04:50.581 --> 04:52.583
that pulls you towards it bosom

04:52.583 --> 04:54.669
when the times are their worst.

04:54.669 --> 04:55.753
- No, keep still

04:55.753 --> 04:58.298
because this is going to hurt.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.590

05:11.311 --> 05:12.603
this would be the last day of work

05:12.603 --> 05:14.772
and the first day of the rest of my life.

05:14.772 --> 05:17.108
Today would be the day
that I met the devil

05:17.108 --> 05:19.694
at the crossroads and sold my soul to him.

05:19.694 --> 05:20.528
- Yes.

05:20.528 --> 05:21.863
- Oh, of course you are.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.448
Mrs. Jackson, you've got no idea

05:23.448 --> 05:26.117
how extremely happy I
am to catch you at home.

05:26.117 --> 05:28.119
You see, I've got some magnificent news

05:28.119 --> 05:29.162
to you, Mrs. Jackson.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.747
Mind if I come in?

05:30.747 --> 05:31.706
- Well, what is it?

05:31.706 --> 05:33.458
I haven't got any money, if
that's what you're after.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.500
- Mrs. Jackson, I don't
want a penny from you

05:34.500 --> 05:36.210
but what I would like to be

05:36.210 --> 05:37.211
is a person that informs you

05:37.211 --> 05:39.839
that you have just won 10,000 pounds

05:39.839 --> 05:41.966

06:13.122 --> 06:14.290
- That's exactly right, Mrs. Jackson.

06:14.290 --> 06:16.459
Now, all I need to do before
I can release the check,

06:16.459 --> 06:18.878

a little bit of paperwork.

06:24.509 --> 06:25.385
- Oh he'll be over the moon, won't he?

06:25.385 --> 06:27.178
Especially if he comes
back with no winnings, eh?

06:27.178 --> 06:28.805
- He's not going to believe this.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.724
(soft tense music)

06:48.699 --> 06:50.326
Would you like a cup of tea, dear?

06:50.326 --> 06:51.202
- I'm actually in a little bit

06:51.202 --> 06:52.829
of a hurry today, Mrs. Jackson.

- Yes of course, upstairs on the left.

07:10.346 --> 07:11.889

- [Narrator] My journey
to becoming a billionaire

08:07.653 --> 08:09.280
began humbly when I was moved out

08:09.280 --> 08:11.073
of my grandfather's home at 16

08:11.073 --> 08:14.285
and into a hostel for the
homeless and destitute.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.120
Some days I'll go hungry,

08:16.120 --> 08:18.372
but that poverty gave me gile,

08:18.372 --> 08:19.582
and made me savvy and able

08:19.582 --> 08:22.335
to fend for myself by any means necessary.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.004
I was self employed and self sufficient.

08:26.589 --> 08:29.008
(soft music)

08:34.639 --> 08:37.141
But my soul stunk of
the stench of a thief,

08:37.141 --> 08:38.518
a liar, and a conman

08:38.518 --> 08:40.937
and my long, hard road
searching for a way out

08:40.937 --> 08:42.813
of the poverty I chose for myself

08:42.813 --> 08:44.398
by moving away from me granddad

08:45.525 --> 08:46.984
and the proclivities of poverty

08:46.984 --> 08:49.070
can drive even the most ambitious men

08:49.070 --> 08:51.155
to the lowest stacks imaginable

08:51.155 --> 08:54.325
and justifies it with those fateful words.

08:54.325 --> 08:56.244
I do what I have to do to survive.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.956

In my perverse previous life,

Shaun was about as close
to an employer as I had.

09:09.006 --> 09:11.551
He bought just about
anything for the right price.

09:12.593 --> 09:14.387
- Yeah, that's a good one.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.263
- [Narrator] Over the years, I sold him

09:15.263 --> 09:17.848
just about most things.

09:17.848 --> 09:19.183
- Before I forget, some weirdo was in here

09:19.183 --> 09:21.435
looking for you the other day.

09:21.435 --> 09:23.271
- What do you mean a weirdo?

09:23.271 --> 09:24.063
- I don't know, he was a weirdo.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.481
He was wearing a white suit.

09:25.481 --> 09:26.983
- What's this, 1975?

09:26.983 --> 09:28.067
- That's what I'm saying.

09:28.067 --> 09:29.277
He's a fucking weirdo.

09:33.447 --> 09:34.407
He left something for you.

09:58.889 --> 10:00.683
of the pull I had towards stress.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.770
Maybe it was just a
prospect of being well paid.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.480
Either way, from that moment

10:06.480 --> 10:08.983
I was already mentally
preparing my journey ahead.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.902
- Seems like bollocks to me, mate.

10:15.197 --> 10:17.700
- Yes, so your friend
Shaun, he did this to you?

10:17.700 --> 10:20.453
- You're not fucking listening, Grandad.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.830

11:51.001 --> 11:53.796
in the real beyond comprehension
to an unblessed mind.

11:55.589 --> 11:57.258
But when God gives you a gift,

11:57.258 --> 11:58.426
he also hands you a knife

11:58.426 --> 12:00.177
to stab yourself in the gut with.

I say the wrong thing,

in the second amendment

13:14.084 --> 13:16.086
and I will not survive my arms.

13:16.086 --> 13:17.213

of the American constitution.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.637
- It does fucking apply

13:24.637 --> 13:26.096
because there are 10 motherfuckers

13:26.096 --> 13:28.224
waving around shotguns like cigarettes.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.434
This son of bitch is stabbing himself up

- Star.

15:58.415 --> 15:59.375
- Your real name.

16:05.839 --> 16:06.757
- It's Jolie.

16:09.551 --> 16:13.263
- Has anyone ever told you
how beautiful you are, Jolie?

16:17.059 --> 16:17.893
- Look.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.272
You better go if you're not buying.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.026
- Do you believe in love
at first sight, Jolie?

16:29.905 --> 16:30.739
- Yeah.

16:34.743 --> 16:37.913
(footsteps crunching)

16:43.168 --> 16:45.421
- Her pussy's still tight.

16:45.421 --> 16:46.588
It's her first week.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.592
So what we doing here?

16:50.592 --> 16:52.428
Flirting, negotiating?

16:54.221 --> 16:56.098
She'll suck your dick for 30.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.934
(gunshot)
(women screaming)

16:58.934 --> 17:01.478
(gunshots)

17:01.478 --> 17:03.897
♪ We'll ride ♪

17:11.113 --> 17:13.866
- Come on, let's get out of here.

17:27.504 --> 17:28.756
- [Narrator] Mickey and Jolie were meant

17:28.756 --> 17:30.507
to be together forever.

17:30.507 --> 17:31.508
When their stories are written

17:31.508 --> 17:33.177
their lives are woven together

17:33.177 --> 17:35.471
in a cacophony of love,
loyalty, and passion.

17:39.099 --> 17:40.559
No one mattered before

17:40.559 --> 17:42.936
and no one else will ever matter again.

17:45.522 --> 17:47.691
With the love of his life by his side,

17:47.691 --> 17:49.068
Mickey and Jolie have purchased

17:49.068 --> 17:50.819
a small quiet pub on the outskirts

17:50.819 --> 17:52.362
of the city where Mickey will continue

17:52.362 --> 17:54.364
his thriving business under the radar

17:54.364 --> 17:56.408
with metropolitan police.

17:58.368 --> 17:59.953
But everything was about to change

17:59.953 --> 18:01.538
one sunny summer afternoon.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.919
Mickey was as smooth as silk

18:06.919 --> 18:08.420
but as dangerous as a tiger.

18:09.630 --> 18:12.132
Affectionately known as
the Sinatra of the slums.

18:13.008 --> 18:15.135
Mickey was a natural entrepreneur,

18:15.135 --> 18:17.262
whose product happened to be narcotics.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.226
(tense western music)

18:51.505 --> 18:53.298
- What you selling, mate?

18:55.134 --> 18:57.553
- We've got beer, spirits.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.639
Pretty much any alcoholic
or non alcoholic beverage

19:00.639 --> 19:02.224
your require, what can I get ya?

19:04.268 --> 19:06.311
- That's not what he means.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.856
What have you got behind the fucking bar?

19:08.856 --> 19:10.691
- [Mickey] That does not concern you.

19:10.691 --> 19:11.942
- Why not?

19:11.942 --> 19:13.443
I like cocaine.

19:13.443 --> 19:15.195
Is that what it is, coke?

19:15.195 --> 19:16.196
Or is it H?

19:17.156 --> 19:18.031
What have you got?

19:18.031 --> 19:19.199
We've got the money.

19:21.577 --> 19:22.911
- I'm afraid we're not currently accepting

19:22.911 --> 19:24.454
new customers at the present moment.

19:24.454 --> 19:25.873
If that situation should change,

19:25.873 --> 19:27.541
I'll be sure to let you both know.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.713
- Give us the shit or we'll blow

19:32.713 --> 19:34.882
your fucking brains out, mate.

19:34.882 --> 19:37.176
- Don't you point a gun at my baby.

19:37.176 --> 19:40.262
Put your fucking gun down
and get the fuck out of here

19:40.262 --> 19:42.472
before I put a bullet
in your fucking skull.

19:43.557 --> 19:46.059
(tense music)

19:50.397 --> 19:52.065
- Right.

19:52.065 --> 19:53.734
Now you've gone and upset my wife.

19:54.776 --> 19:56.570
- What, do you think this is a joke?

19:58.071 --> 20:00.407
- I suggest you put the guns down.

20:00.407 --> 20:03.577
(tense western music)

20:08.498 --> 20:09.625
- Or what?

20:09.625 --> 20:10.500
(gunshot)

20:10.500 --> 20:11.585
(gunshot)

20:11.585 --> 20:13.712
(gunshot)

20:13.712 --> 20:14.546
- Fuck.

20:18.217 --> 20:23.222
(somber tense music)
(sobbing)

20:23.639 --> 20:24.514
- Oh baby.

20:28.685 --> 20:30.812
- Don't cry, don't cry.

20:30.812 --> 20:32.356
It's gonna be all right.

20:32.356 --> 20:33.357
- Oh my god.

20:35.525 --> 20:36.526
Come on, look at me.

20:36.526 --> 20:37.444
Look at me.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.529
Don't die like this baby, just, don't die.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.533
Come on, please.

20:43.533 --> 20:44.952
- Hey, don't cry.

20:46.328 --> 20:49.122
- (mumbling)

20:49.122 --> 20:51.250
You're not gonna die.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.542
Please, please.

20:54.127 --> 20:55.712
I love you so much.

20:58.715 --> 21:00.384
- Hey.

21:00.384 --> 21:05.305
You're the only woman
I've ever loved, Jolie.

21:05.305 --> 21:08.475
(whispering)

21:08.475 --> 21:10.269
- You're not gonna die like this.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.853
You're not gonna die like this, baby.

21:11.853 --> 21:14.481
You're not gonna die like this.

21:14.481 --> 21:16.358
You're not gonna die.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.277
- You've gotta be strong for me.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.111
All right?

21:19.111 --> 21:20.737
- No, not like this, baby.

21:20.737 --> 21:22.030
- You raise the child.

21:22.030 --> 21:24.116
(sobbing)

21:24.116 --> 21:26.576
- No, not like this.

21:26.576 --> 21:29.121
(somber music)

21:39.298 --> 21:41.633
(screaming)

21:54.604 --> 21:57.149
(somber music)

22:06.408 --> 22:08.744
(gun cocking)

22:08.744 --> 22:11.330
(gun clicking)

22:18.420 --> 22:20.047
- No!

22:20.047 --> 22:22.174
(gunshot)

22:26.386 --> 22:28.972
(somber music)

22:44.988 --> 22:47.908
- [Narrator] Life took
everything Jolie had that day.

22:47.908 --> 22:52.371
Her husband, her unborn
child, and her soul.

22:55.665 --> 22:56.458
- Excuse me--

22:56.458 --> 22:57.876
- What do you want?

22:57.876 --> 22:59.753
- A man dressed in a white suit

22:59.753 --> 23:02.589
said he would pay me 20
pounds to give you this.

23:05.425 --> 23:06.259
- [Narrator] But what a powerful thing

23:06.259 --> 23:08.929
more than anything or
anyone is a lost soul

23:08.929 --> 23:09.971
with nothing to lose.

23:11.306 --> 23:12.682
They can't be bargained with,

23:12.682 --> 23:13.767
bribed or intimidated.

23:15.685 --> 23:17.104
When everything is taken from you,

23:17.104 --> 23:18.814
you have nothing left to lose.

23:20.107 --> 23:22.484
(soft music)

23:32.953 --> 23:35.414
- I can hardly contain myself.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.707
I have waited my entire
life for this moment.

23:37.707 --> 23:39.292
- Sounds like an eventful life.

23:42.003 --> 23:42.879
- My dear, Jolie.

23:44.214 --> 23:45.257
Sweet Saint Jolie.

23:46.716 --> 23:49.553
I am most sincerely sorry for your loss,

23:49.553 --> 23:50.429
both of them.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.763
- Fuck you.

23:51.763 --> 23:52.597
- But what if I were to tell

23:52.597 --> 23:54.433
that your loss was
merely part of your story

23:54.433 --> 23:56.268
told a thousand years ago?

23:56.268 --> 23:57.144
- Listen, bruv.

23:57.144 --> 23:58.145
I haven't come all this
way to hear bullshit.

23:58.145 --> 23:59.312
Just get to the point.

24:01.064 --> 24:03.442
- Have you heard of the New World Order?

24:07.279 --> 24:09.990
The New World Order is old as man himself.

24:11.074 --> 24:12.451
The self proclaimed illuminated

24:12.451 --> 24:14.536
are a group of powerful individuals

24:14.536 --> 24:17.080
that control every aspect of our world.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.833
The food we eat, the money we spend,

24:19.833 --> 24:21.543
the things we watch on television.

24:22.502 --> 24:26.465
Over the centuries,
queens, kings, presidents,

24:26.465 --> 24:27.591
prime ministers and popes

24:27.591 --> 24:29.593
have all been members.

24:29.593 --> 24:32.012
Selected by the blueness of their blood.

24:32.012 --> 24:33.972
Many believe that this blueness

24:33.972 --> 24:36.057
was caused by inbreeding

24:36.057 --> 24:37.684
but unfortunately it's caused

24:37.684 --> 24:39.978
by something a lot more sinister.

24:39.978 --> 24:41.354
- What are you talking about?

24:41.354 --> 24:43.106
Blue blood is a saying.

24:44.232 --> 24:45.233
Doesn't mean anything.

24:45.233 --> 24:47.027
They don't actually
have blue fucking blood,

24:47.027 --> 24:48.111
do they?

24:48.111 --> 24:49.196
So what are you talking about?

24:50.989 --> 24:52.908
- Are you sure about that, Jeremiah?

24:56.286 --> 24:57.787
- So what do you want with me?

24:58.705 --> 24:59.956
- Members of the New World Order

24:59.956 --> 25:02.125
are indoctrinated as children,

25:02.125 --> 25:03.710
forced to sell their souls to Satan

25:03.710 --> 25:05.045
and the forces of evil.

25:06.004 --> 25:08.006
If a member of the New
World Order sees the light

25:08.006 --> 25:09.799
and decides to leave.

25:09.799 --> 25:11.092
They are murdered.

25:11.092 --> 25:12.552
Their souls captured by Satan

25:12.552 --> 25:14.804
and tortured till the
end of days and beyond.

25:16.014 --> 25:17.641
- Sounds like fucking bullshit.

25:17.641 --> 25:18.850
- Waste of fucking time.

25:18.850 --> 25:22.729
So, let's have a drink later, then?

25:22.729 --> 25:24.147
- Drop dead.

25:24.147 --> 25:25.607
- But one child is different.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.945
Sent from the heavens by God himself,

25:29.945 --> 25:32.280
blue blooded but pure.

25:32.280 --> 25:34.074
- You should take that up with Satan.

25:34.074 --> 25:36.826
- You will be paid one million pound each

25:36.826 --> 25:39.746
for the child's safe
capture and return to me.

25:41.289 --> 25:42.123
Jolie.

25:44.376 --> 25:45.752
If you accept this mission,

25:46.753 --> 25:49.339
you will be reunited with your husband.

25:49.339 --> 25:50.966
- My husband is dead.

25:52.175 --> 25:54.094
Don't you dare play with my emotions.

25:55.011 --> 25:57.639
- What I speak to you is the truth.

25:57.639 --> 25:58.682
So help me, God.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.565
You won't both survive

26:08.900 --> 26:10.694
but you were certainly be canonized.

26:12.153 --> 26:13.196
- She doesn't matter.

26:15.782 --> 26:20.745
Now, tell me about that money.

26:20.787 --> 26:22.872
Is it here, now?

26:24.874 --> 26:26.793
- I'm afraid it does matter, Jeremiah.

26:27.711 --> 26:30.380
The scriptures clearly
state the both of you.

26:33.133 --> 26:35.719
- What you on about scriptures?

26:38.597 --> 26:40.098
- The dead sea scrolls.

26:43.393 --> 26:46.479
(singing in Italian)

26:47.814 --> 26:49.316
- [Narrator] Many believe
that the dead sea scrolls

26:49.316 --> 26:51.234
to be rejected passages from the Bible,

26:51.234 --> 26:53.194
both old and new testaments

26:53.194 --> 26:55.530
and saw this as proof that
the bible was man made

26:55.530 --> 26:57.949
and nothing more than a work of fiction.

26:57.949 --> 27:00.160
The truth is, the dead sea scrolls

27:00.160 --> 27:02.996
are merely the private
library of the Essence.

27:02.996 --> 27:05.624
The Essence were a small
group of great minds

27:05.624 --> 27:07.626
and healers who lived
thousands of years ago

27:07.626 --> 27:09.210
in small caves in the holy land.

27:11.129 --> 27:14.799
Locals believed these great
minds to be more than human

27:14.799 --> 27:17.052
and some even believed
the Essence to be angels

27:17.052 --> 27:18.470
sent from heaven.

27:19.346 --> 27:20.347
- Oh the Essence, you call them.

27:20.347 --> 27:22.432
I didn't know what that meant.

27:22.432 --> 27:25.352
Oh the Essence, oh what
a silly boy you are.

27:25.352 --> 27:26.686
Certainly you have no
education whatsoever.

27:26.686 --> 27:28.355
No, it's called Essene.

27:28.355 --> 27:29.147
Essene.

27:29.147 --> 27:30.857
- The Essence were handed down their gifts

27:30.857 --> 27:33.109
from fallen angels that
arrived at Mount Hermon,

27:33.109 --> 27:35.278
as mentioned in the book of Enoch.

27:35.278 --> 27:37.989
The Essence were the true illuminated

27:37.989 --> 27:39.407
who were hunted like dogs

27:39.407 --> 27:41.660
and slaughtered by the New World Order

27:41.660 --> 27:43.787
to stop their teachings being spread

27:43.787 --> 27:45.163
and illuminating the world

27:45.163 --> 27:47.666
with their wisdom of the righteous

27:47.666 --> 27:51.419
all but two Essence
survived the bloodbath.

27:51.419 --> 27:53.672
Gabriel and Mary.

27:55.215 --> 27:56.424
They lived out their days hiding

27:56.424 --> 27:58.051
in a small mountain cave.

27:58.051 --> 27:59.594
There they had a family.

27:59.594 --> 28:02.806
The Essence genes survived, just,

28:02.806 --> 28:04.891
and lives on to this very day,

28:04.891 --> 28:07.268
though very limited in number.

28:09.854 --> 28:12.982
You two are descendants of the Essence.

28:14.067 --> 28:15.694
- Listen, bruv, I'm a lot of things

28:15.694 --> 28:17.278
but I afraid I'm not superhuman.

28:17.278 --> 28:18.113
- Speak for yourself.

28:18.113 --> 28:19.698
- Another envelope?

28:19.698 --> 28:20.490
Fantastic.

28:21.825 --> 28:24.244
- [Adrestos] The New
Word Order hold a party

28:24.244 --> 28:26.079
to indoctrinate their newest members

28:26.079 --> 28:28.581
in the presence of the
Prince of Darkness himself.

28:31.835 --> 28:32.711
- [Narrator] Every four years,

28:32.711 --> 28:34.212
the New World Order elects a man

28:34.212 --> 28:36.464
to take on the human form of the devil.

28:36.464 --> 28:39.134
I select this man by
the sins he's committed

28:39.134 --> 28:41.428
and his manifesto for western society.

28:42.595 --> 28:45.056
This quadroon, the illuminated elected

28:45.056 --> 28:47.016
a serial child molester,

28:47.016 --> 28:48.643
groomer and abuser,

28:48.643 --> 28:50.145
whose manifesto is based

28:50.145 --> 28:53.440
on the emasculation and
feminization of men.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.024
The destruction of Christianity

28:55.024 --> 28:57.485
and the abolition of the nuclear family.

28:58.528 --> 28:59.863
- Inside the envelope you will find

28:59.863 --> 29:01.865
a GPS navigation system

29:01.865 --> 29:04.492
with pre programmed
coordinates to the island.

29:04.492 --> 29:06.035
- Directions to hell, lovely.

29:06.035 --> 29:08.371
- No, Jeremiah.

29:08.371 --> 29:09.622
Hell is empty.

29:09.622 --> 29:11.666
All the devils are already here.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.754
- Is this the kid, then?

29:15.754 --> 29:18.965
- Yes, that is indeed our little savoir.

29:18.965 --> 29:21.760
- So the child is an Essence, too, right?

29:21.760 --> 29:26.473
- No, he is far, far
more important than that.

29:29.476 --> 29:32.187
- These look expensive.

29:32.187 --> 29:34.355
- Those are for the Ferryman.

29:34.355 --> 29:35.815
Once you reach the shore,

29:35.815 --> 29:37.692
he will guide you the rest of the way.

29:40.653 --> 29:41.654
- What about these?

29:41.654 --> 29:43.114
Is it fucking Halloween or what?

29:45.492 --> 29:47.202
- It is a tradition they have followed

29:47.202 --> 29:49.996
for many, many years
since their existence.

29:52.081 --> 29:54.501
Make sure you wear the masks

29:54.501 --> 29:56.878
before you see the Ferryman.

29:56.878 --> 29:58.379
Or you will be doomed to fail.

30:01.633 --> 30:04.552
(soft tense music)

30:17.565 --> 30:18.733
- [Narrator] Should the child be raised

30:18.733 --> 30:20.944
by Satan and the forces of evil,

30:20.944 --> 30:22.654
the next generation will be doomed

30:22.654 --> 30:24.864
and burn in ever lasting hellfire.

30:25.698 --> 30:27.700
Should he be raised by the forces of good

30:27.700 --> 30:30.912
and the righteous, we will be saved.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.622
- Shoot this son of a bitch.

30:34.833 --> 30:35.667
- But mummy.

30:38.127 --> 30:38.920
- Listen to me.

30:40.588 --> 30:45.134
That cunt killed your daddy.

30:46.052 --> 30:48.680
Don't you dare sob for
him, don't you dare.

30:50.139 --> 30:51.891
Huh, come, pull yourself together

30:52.934 --> 30:54.394
and pull the goddamn trigger.

30:55.478 --> 30:57.146
- I don't want to.

30:57.146 --> 30:59.148
- Don't you love your mummy?

31:01.234 --> 31:02.569
- I do love you.

31:03.611 --> 31:06.030
- Didn't you love your daddy?

31:07.073 --> 31:07.907
- But mum.

31:10.159 --> 31:15.164
- That man, yeah, he took your daddy away.

31:16.374 --> 31:19.878
Don't that make you just a little bit mad?

31:21.421 --> 31:23.923
- Yeah, that does make me mad.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.885
- I'll show you, son.

31:26.885 --> 31:29.637
It gets easier after awhile.

31:29.637 --> 31:30.471
Yeah?

31:31.389 --> 31:32.223
Okay.

31:33.099 --> 31:35.727
In the end, it's just point and shoot.

31:35.727 --> 31:36.603
Look, look, look.

31:37.812 --> 31:40.940
Just point and shoot.

31:41.983 --> 31:42.817
- It's cruel.

31:44.402 --> 31:45.987
- Cruel, you say.

31:45.987 --> 31:48.364
Yeah, that sounds like cowardly talk to me

31:48.364 --> 31:50.366
and I aint raised no coward.

31:51.492 --> 31:54.203
Now, there will be no dinner,

31:54.203 --> 31:56.706
no breakfast, no nothing for you.

31:56.706 --> 31:57.540
Yeah?

31:57.540 --> 31:59.751
Until you start behaving like a man.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.002
Do you hear me?

32:02.045 --> 32:02.921
- Mum.

32:04.380 --> 32:05.924
- No buts.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.676
I am so ashamed of you right now.

32:09.969 --> 32:14.474
Yeah, now you stop behaving
like a little pussy.

32:15.934 --> 32:19.395
I'll beat your ass and
take you to your new daddy

32:20.229 --> 32:23.650
telling him how disappointed I am in you,

32:23.650 --> 32:26.569
the way you turned out.

32:26.569 --> 32:29.489
(soft tense music)

32:38.957 --> 32:41.084
(sobbing)

32:44.128 --> 32:44.963
- Sorry, sir.

32:46.381 --> 32:47.966
(gunshot)

32:47.966 --> 32:50.843
(soft tense music)

33:02.563 --> 33:04.691
- [Narrator] We drove all night

33:04.691 --> 33:06.985
and as I spiraled slowly through the dark

33:06.985 --> 33:08.987
and dimly lit country roads,

33:08.987 --> 33:11.364
seeds of doubt began to sprout in my mind.

33:13.199 --> 33:14.701
Was the whole story gibberish?

33:15.994 --> 33:16.828
I had to admit to myself

33:16.828 --> 33:19.288
that the whole thing sounded insane.

33:19.288 --> 33:20.707
The ramblings of a mad man

33:20.707 --> 33:23.584
who liked the taste of the
masses opium a little too much.

33:26.212 --> 33:28.923
- You will be paid one million pound each

33:28.923 --> 33:30.883
for the child's safe capture.

33:30.883 --> 33:32.802
- [Narrator] But as a
man who had known hunger,

33:32.802 --> 33:34.303
for a million pound,

33:34.303 --> 33:36.014
I was prepared to believe in Bigfoot.

34:05.752 --> 34:07.879
- Forgetting something, didn't you?

34:07.879 --> 34:10.131
- I aint wearing that shit.

34:27.815 --> 34:29.358
(eerie organ music)

34:29.358 --> 34:31.652
(screaming)

34:44.373 --> 34:45.792
- If you accept this mission,

34:46.876 --> 34:49.670
you will be reunited with your husband.

34:49.670 --> 34:50.505
- Any funny shit, yeah,

34:50.505 --> 34:51.881
and I'm gonna put one in your dome,

34:51.881 --> 34:53.216
do you hear me?

34:53.216 --> 34:56.177
(tense organ music)

35:07.605 --> 35:10.108
- [Narrator] The island
was unknown to the public.

35:10.108 --> 35:10.900
It's on a remote island

35:10.900 --> 35:12.485
off the coast of northern England.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.114
But I remained skeptical.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.824
I couldn't help but feel destiny's hand

35:17.824 --> 35:19.408
slowly guiding our way

35:19.408 --> 35:22.120
through the mist and fog of the Irish sea

35:22.120 --> 35:24.831
but in the distance we saw it.

35:24.831 --> 35:26.415
The devil's island.

35:27.333 --> 35:28.543
Hell itself.

35:28.543 --> 35:31.546
(tense organ music)

36:38.321 --> 36:41.240
(soft piano music)

36:58.966 --> 37:02.094
- We wrestle not with flesh and blood

37:03.012 --> 37:06.766
but with principalities, with powers,

37:06.766 --> 37:08.142
with rulers of the world,

37:09.227 --> 37:11.812
with spiritual wickedness in high places,

37:14.357 --> 37:15.858
yet you, Jeremiah,

37:16.984 --> 37:19.779
you will end mankind's struggles.

37:19.779 --> 37:22.323
You've been sent here to save us

37:22.323 --> 37:23.658
and save us you will.

37:34.377 --> 37:35.253
Santa Jolie,

37:36.337 --> 37:37.463
Santa Jeremiah,

37:38.547 --> 37:41.592
please forgive me for all my sins.

37:41.592 --> 37:43.177
My name is Rabboni,

37:43.177 --> 37:44.595
I'm a mortal servant

37:44.595 --> 37:45.429
and I've been sent here

37:45.429 --> 37:47.348
to guide you through this port of hell.

37:47.348 --> 37:48.182
- Oi, get up.

37:48.182 --> 37:49.100
He's not a saint.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.268
- Speak for yourself.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.978
- [Jolie] You don't
believe this shit, do you?

37:51.978 --> 37:52.979
- Of course I fucking don't.

37:52.979 --> 37:54.021
What, do you?

37:56.148 --> 37:57.275
- Don't really know what to believe.

37:57.275 --> 37:58.317
- Oh you must believe.

37:59.402 --> 38:01.445
Trust in God.

38:01.445 --> 38:03.447
He's the savoir of all men.

38:03.447 --> 38:04.907
Especially those who believe.

38:05.866 --> 38:07.285
Timothy 4:10.

38:08.494 --> 38:10.705
- Sounds like religious bullshit to me.

38:10.705 --> 38:11.580
- If you're so skeptical

38:11.580 --> 38:13.291
why the fuck are you even here?

38:13.291 --> 38:16.669
So we can reunite you with
your dead husband, is that?

38:19.714 --> 38:22.216
- You fucking little prick!

38:22.216 --> 38:23.050
- Hit her.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.137
Hit her.

38:27.430 --> 38:28.347
Face, face.

38:29.515 --> 38:32.018
(tense music)

38:33.477 --> 38:34.395
Face, face.

38:38.065 --> 38:40.234
- [Narrator] She hit me first

38:40.234 --> 38:43.321
and as a millennial and a
believer in all equality.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.906
Equal rights, equal fights.

38:53.039 --> 38:55.374
- I wouldn't worry about it, Jeremiah.

38:56.334 --> 38:57.335
She had that coming.

38:58.627 --> 39:00.504
Equal rights, equal fights,

39:00.504 --> 39:02.631
as far as I'm concerned.

39:02.631 --> 39:05.468
(soft tense music)

39:25.946 --> 39:26.781
- Jolie, I'm--

39:27.698 --> 39:28.532
- Don't.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.542
- She hasn't got the balls to do it.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.171
(gun cocking)

39:42.171 --> 39:43.005
Do you, Jolie?

39:51.097 --> 39:54.558
- Jolie, I'm sorry, I'm
sorry I fucking punched you.

39:54.558 --> 39:55.393
All right, I'm fucking,

39:55.393 --> 39:57.770
I didn't mean it, it fucking happened.

39:57.770 --> 39:59.563
Please, honestly, I'm fucking sorry.

39:59.563 --> 40:00.398
- Shut up.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.820
You're lucky I don't put
one in your fucking dome.

40:09.532 --> 40:10.408
Huh?

40:12.827 --> 40:13.702
Huh.

40:17.289 --> 40:20.876
Feel like a big man,
yeah, hitting a woman?

40:23.337 --> 40:24.213
Little pussy, huh?

40:37.935 --> 40:39.603
- I can take you to him.

40:44.525 --> 40:45.359
- What?

40:47.445 --> 40:50.156
What you know where the boy is?

40:50.156 --> 40:50.990
- Of course I do.

40:52.158 --> 40:54.243
The child is with his daddy in the house.

40:55.202 --> 40:56.036
Come on.

40:57.079 --> 40:58.456
I'll take you to him.

40:58.456 --> 40:59.457
It's not that far.

41:01.500 --> 41:04.462
(soft tense music)

41:19.059 --> 41:21.479
- [Narrator] We walked until
my feet were blistered,

41:21.479 --> 41:22.813
red and raw.

41:22.813 --> 41:24.565
Assured by Rabboni that
we were getting close

41:24.565 --> 41:25.983
to the child and my fortune.

41:26.942 --> 41:29.862
It occurred to me that something
wasn't right about Rabboni

41:29.862 --> 41:32.198
but it didn't matter to me.

41:32.198 --> 41:34.575
Once we had the child
and I secured my reward,

41:34.575 --> 41:36.785
he could to hell for all I cared.

41:36.785 --> 41:38.954
If only I knew what I knew now.

41:38.954 --> 41:40.706
I would of left right then.

41:40.706 --> 41:43.542
But hindsight's a wonderful thing.

42:24.291 --> 42:25.167
Welcome.

42:25.167 --> 42:28.087
- Where the fuck is the

42:28.087 --> 42:29.463

42:37.304 --> 42:39.765
Patron saint of nothing to lose.

42:49.275 --> 42:51.569

42:51.569 --> 42:53.571

42:56.073 --> 42:58.075

42:58.075 --> 43:00.452
- Without rules, where would we be?

Savage beasts.

43:27.146 --> 43:28.606
- Oh, charming.

43:28.606 --> 43:29.398
- Don't worry about Jolie.

43:29.398 --> 43:32.318
She's just a little bit
eager to get in, that's all.

43:32.318 --> 43:33.527
- Well, enjoy yourselves

43:34.945 --> 43:38.324

43:41.702 --> 43:42.536
Cheers, lads.

43:42.536 --> 43:43.370
- Bye, Jeremiah.

43:45.122 --> 43:46.123
Goodbye, Jolie.

43:46.957 --> 43:48.500
- They seem like nice lads to me.

43:48.500 --> 43:50.753
(laughing)

43:58.385 --> 44:01.347
(soft tense music)

44:14.735 --> 44:16.362
- [Narrator] I was a man of the world,

44:16.362 --> 44:18.113
experienced beyond my years

44:18.989 --> 44:20.741
and in my 27 years on this Earth,

44:20.741 --> 44:23.118
I'd seen just about most things.

44:23.118 --> 44:25.162
But everything combined

44:25.162 --> 44:26.997
was nothing compared to what I was about

44:26.997 --> 44:30.167
to witness on this godforsaken island.

44:31.377 --> 44:34.254
(soft tense music)

45:11.625 --> 45:13.210
- You know, Jeremiah,

45:13.210 --> 45:15.796
'round here, if you have money,

45:17.464 --> 45:21.051
even the devil will
polish your gravestone.

45:22.010 --> 45:22.803
- Yeah?

45:24.847 --> 45:27.099
What are you saying, mate?

45:28.183 --> 45:30.102
What's your name again?

45:30.102 --> 45:31.520
I don't think I caught it.

45:31.520 --> 45:32.771
- It's Rabboni.

45:33.647 --> 45:35.566
Means teacher.

45:35.566 --> 45:38.485
(soft tense music)

45:56.462 --> 45:57.296
- Next!

46:02.926 --> 46:04.553
- I don't want to go, mummy.

46:04.553 --> 46:06.388
- Don't be such a baby.

46:06.388 --> 46:09.266
(soft tense music)

46:19.485 --> 46:20.778
- What is this?

46:23.489 --> 46:25.407
- Poor, destitute parents

46:26.533 --> 46:29.661
giving up their spawn for a better life

46:31.288 --> 46:33.373
and will be well rewarded in the process.

46:34.416 --> 46:38.420
Such a kind and noble thing to do.

46:39.671 --> 46:41.799
- Mothers and fathers selling their kids?

46:43.091 --> 46:44.843
- They'll only turn out bad, anyway.

46:46.303 --> 46:51.266
Why, the offspring of pimps,

46:51.725 --> 46:53.811
drug dealers, and rapists.

46:56.647 --> 47:00.526
No, it's better this way.

47:04.112 --> 47:07.282
Either that or abortion.

47:07.282 --> 47:09.368
- I thought you were a man of God?

47:13.205 --> 47:16.124
- The lord works in
mysterious ways, Jolie.

47:25.717 --> 47:26.718
- [Narrator] That was the first crack

47:26.718 --> 47:29.555
of weakness I'd seen in
Jolie's diamond tough shell.

47:30.389 --> 47:33.308
Maybe it was the memory
of losing her unborn child

47:33.308 --> 47:36.311
or maybe, just a natural
maternal instinct.

47:38.939 --> 47:41.483
Either way, I was gonna let anyone

47:41.483 --> 47:43.151
slowing (mumbling) on my fortune.

47:51.577 --> 47:54.788
(tense dramatic music)

49:21.041 --> 49:24.169
(distant screaming)

49:24.169 --> 49:27.089
(soft piano music)

49:28.423 --> 49:31.259
- You stand here before us today

49:31.259 --> 49:34.513
charged with a very serious crime of,

49:36.974 --> 49:41.269
questioning the policies and ideals

49:41.269 --> 49:43.689
of the New World Order.

49:47.359 --> 49:50.696
My sentence is death.

49:54.700 --> 49:55.867
(gunshot)

49:55.867 --> 49:58.120
(cheering)

50:05.419 --> 50:06.795
- Well, he did have that coming.

50:08.296 --> 50:09.423
- What the fuck is this?

50:09.423 --> 50:10.924
- It's the second case.

50:12.300 --> 50:16.930
Payback, for years of male oppression.

50:16.930 --> 50:19.474
- For the charge of sexism,

50:20.642 --> 50:22.936
your sentence is death.

50:25.230 --> 50:29.735
(gunshot)
(cheering)

50:31.111 --> 50:32.362
- So where's this child?

50:32.362 --> 50:33.196
- I told you.

50:34.614 --> 50:35.657
He's in the house.

50:37.034 --> 50:38.368
It's not that much further.

50:39.619 --> 50:42.956
- [Judge] For the charge
of telling a racist joke,

50:43.957 --> 50:46.543
your sentence is death.

50:47.836 --> 50:51.631
(gunshot)
(cheering)

50:51.631 --> 50:53.341
- [Narrator] When you judge another man,

50:53.341 --> 50:56.803
you don't define them, you define yourself

50:57.637 --> 51:02.392
and these sick bastards were
defined by revenge and hate.

51:06.772 --> 51:09.357
(man shouting)

51:55.195 --> 51:56.988
The house looked like hell on Earth.

52:00.826 --> 52:04.329
But I decided heaven and hell
both belonged in my mind.

52:05.497 --> 52:08.416
(soft tense music)

52:39.156 --> 52:41.449
(laughing)

52:53.003 --> 52:57.591
(shouting)
(chanting)

53:31.708 --> 53:36.379
(screaming)
(chanting)

53:52.979 --> 53:55.857
(soft tense music)

54:03.949 --> 54:08.954
(man screaming)
(chanting)

54:53.081 --> 54:57.002
(chanting in foreign language)

55:00.380 --> 55:01.673
- Listen, bitch.

55:01.673 --> 55:04.134
All that witchcraft shit doesn't scare me.

55:04.134 --> 55:05.010
We're here for the boy.

55:05.010 --> 55:07.095
Where the fuck is this boy?

55:07.095 --> 55:09.806
- Don't you see, Jolie, you're too late.

55:09.806 --> 55:13.393
The child is with the illuminated now.

55:14.602 --> 55:17.856
Plagues will rain from the sky

55:17.856 --> 55:20.025
and resurrection will begin.

55:25.613 --> 55:26.698
- Stick together.

55:27.699 --> 55:32.078
It's the only way we're
gonna get out of this alive.

55:32.078 --> 55:33.621
Come.

55:33.621 --> 55:34.914
- Yeah.

55:34.914 --> 55:36.416
- Jeremiah.

55:36.416 --> 55:37.500
The greatest.

55:38.376 --> 55:40.253
- I don't even know who you are.

55:40.253 --> 55:42.547
- Oh my god, it's Jolie and Jeremiah.

55:42.547 --> 55:46.134
- How the fuck do they know who I am?

55:46.134 --> 55:47.385
- I don't know.

56:05.070 --> 56:07.405
- Brother, sister, join us.

56:07.405 --> 56:09.074
Awake your inner beasts.

56:11.493 --> 56:12.494
- [Jeremiah] I could eat.

56:12.494 --> 56:13.703
We got time, right?

56:13.703 --> 56:14.704
- [Jolie] For fucks sake.

56:14.704 --> 56:15.789
- I aint eaten all day.

56:17.457 --> 56:18.291
- Come on.

56:23.463 --> 56:24.464
- Smells like swine.

56:26.800 --> 56:28.426
All right?

56:28.426 --> 56:29.386
- Oh.

56:29.386 --> 56:31.930
(laughing)

56:31.930 --> 56:33.890
- You fucking sick bastard.

56:33.890 --> 56:34.891
- What's the matter?

56:34.891 --> 56:36.684
You must try some.

56:36.684 --> 56:40.105
It eating an infant a year, even,

56:40.105 --> 56:42.816
it's gonna give you 20 years of life.

56:42.816 --> 56:44.275
- You're a fucking baby killer.

56:44.275 --> 56:45.902
- No.

56:45.902 --> 56:46.986
No, it's not real.

56:46.986 --> 56:48.613
It's a prop.

56:48.613 --> 56:50.407
We're here for one reason, remember?

56:51.574 --> 56:52.409
Relax.

56:53.535 --> 56:54.702
- The child is upstairs.

56:54.702 --> 56:55.495
Hurry.

56:56.454 --> 56:58.706
- Do you know they're
eating fucking babies?

57:00.041 --> 57:02.544
- But who wouldn't want
an extra 20 years, Jolie?

57:04.170 --> 57:07.215
Think about what you could
do with an extra 20 years.

57:08.133 --> 57:11.010
- Let's just get the
child and get out of here.

57:11.010 --> 57:12.554
- No, listen, yeah.

57:12.554 --> 57:15.140
I'm gonna come back and when I do,

57:15.140 --> 57:18.059
I'm gonna torture every
single one of you cunts.

57:18.059 --> 57:20.728
- There's a major overpopulation
on this planet, Jolie

57:22.564 --> 57:26.276
and radical times call
for radical solutions.

57:26.276 --> 57:27.277
- No.

57:27.277 --> 57:29.446
- Don't you care about your planet, Jolie?

57:30.488 --> 57:31.948
Now, come on.
- No.

57:31.948 --> 57:32.782
- He's waiting.

57:34.868 --> 57:35.743
- Filthy fucks!

57:38.329 --> 57:40.915
(man shouting)

57:44.169 --> 57:45.003
Mickey.

57:45.003 --> 57:45.920
Mickey, Mickey baby,

57:45.920 --> 57:47.672
is that you?
- I think you're gonna

57:47.672 --> 57:48.798
like it here, Jolie.

57:48.798 --> 57:50.467
- Oh, no, no, no

57:50.467 --> 57:51.468
that's impossible.

57:51.468 --> 57:52.302
- Is it?

57:52.302 --> 57:53.178
- That's impossible.

57:53.178 --> 57:54.971
- Matthew, 19:26.

57:56.639 --> 57:58.850
With man it is impossible,

57:58.850 --> 58:01.060
but with God anything is possible.

58:01.060 --> 58:02.353
- Is that him?
- He can be anything

58:02.353 --> 58:03.480
you want him to be, Jolie.

58:03.480 --> 58:04.772
- Please, is that actually him?

58:04.772 --> 58:06.774
- Do you want him with
all your heart and soul?

58:06.774 --> 58:07.609
- I do.

58:08.485 --> 58:09.486
I do.

58:09.486 --> 58:10.278
- Then let's go.

58:10.278 --> 58:11.112
- I do.

58:11.112 --> 58:13.615
(tense music)

58:19.120 --> 58:19.954
Mickey?

58:21.122 --> 58:24.042
(soft tense music)

58:25.293 --> 58:26.294
Oi, Rabboni.

58:27.504 --> 58:29.297
I need fucking answers.

58:29.297 --> 58:32.842
- An answer I shall get you one shortly.

58:32.842 --> 58:33.801
I'm sorry.

58:33.801 --> 58:35.845
I never meant to upset you.

58:37.597 --> 58:39.516
I just wanted us to be friends.

58:39.516 --> 58:40.308
- Friends?

58:40.308 --> 58:41.142
- Comrades.

58:41.142 --> 58:42.310
- You aint my friend.

58:42.310 --> 58:43.603
- How the fuck do they know who we are?

58:43.603 --> 58:45.813
- Because you're a legend, Jeremiah.

58:46.814 --> 58:49.234
An absolute fucking legend.

58:50.652 --> 58:51.528
Both of ya.

58:53.655 --> 58:55.406
Surely you understand that now.

58:56.824 --> 58:57.909
- I don't understand.

58:57.909 --> 58:59.869
What you mean?

58:59.869 --> 59:03.122
- Stop being such an unbearable fucker.

59:04.249 --> 59:05.166
Now come on.

59:06.417 --> 59:08.920
The child is in here
somewhere, the little rascal.

59:12.882 --> 59:15.969
(laughing)

59:15.969 --> 59:16.844
Come in.

59:17.845 --> 59:18.680
They don't bite.

59:21.558 --> 59:24.060
Don't be such prudes.

59:26.187 --> 59:28.690
These are just a couple
of our newest members.

59:30.441 --> 59:32.360
We keep the tapes in the vault

59:32.360 --> 59:35.154
for a little insurance policy.

59:36.864 --> 59:39.576
Because if any of these bare asses

59:40.952 --> 59:42.704
become an important bare ass,

59:45.415 --> 59:48.293
well then we will have the evidence

59:49.752 --> 59:53.006
of them doing guilty things.

59:54.465 --> 59:56.301
- Come, Jeremiah.

59:56.301 --> 59:57.802
Come and play with us.

59:59.596 --> 1:00:02.307
- Jolie, come on you know you want to.

1:00:03.600 --> 1:00:05.310
- Maybe later, ladies, eh?

1:00:05.310 --> 1:00:07.395
Little Jeremiah stays in his cage

1:00:07.395 --> 1:00:08.313
while I'm working.

1:00:09.647 --> 1:00:11.608
- Any of you see the child?

1:00:11.608 --> 1:00:12.442
- Oi, look.

1:00:12.442 --> 1:00:14.027
Where's this fucking child?

1:00:14.027 --> 1:00:15.528
Hello!

1:00:15.528 --> 1:00:18.031
(laughing)

1:00:18.031 --> 1:00:18.906
- Come on.

1:00:19.699 --> 1:00:20.533
This way.

1:00:35.465 --> 1:00:36.341
Look at you two.

1:00:39.427 --> 1:00:41.012
You look beautiful.

1:00:45.850 --> 1:00:47.435
He's going to be so proud of you.

1:00:47.435 --> 1:00:49.562
- Is it Mickey, is Mickey in there?

1:00:49.562 --> 1:00:50.563
- Is my money in there?

1:00:50.563 --> 1:00:52.815
(laughing)

1:00:57.070 --> 1:00:59.572
- It's better than all that.

1:00:59.572 --> 1:01:02.241
(man screaming)

1:01:30.395 --> 1:01:31.229
Daddy.

1:01:35.274 --> 1:01:36.109
- Daddy?

1:01:37.819 --> 1:01:39.237
- Jeremiah.

1:01:39.237 --> 1:01:41.531
The famous Jeremiah we've
heard so much about.

1:01:43.533 --> 1:01:46.452
(people screaming)

1:01:54.210 --> 1:01:55.253
But I must say, Jeremiah.

1:01:55.253 --> 1:01:56.587
You're looking spectacular.

1:01:58.089 --> 1:01:59.465
Have you been moisturizing?

1:01:59.465 --> 1:02:00.425
- Just where's the child?

1:02:00.425 --> 1:02:01.426
- What child?

1:02:01.426 --> 1:02:02.427
- Stop playing games.

1:02:02.427 --> 1:02:03.302
- Relax, Jolie, please.

1:02:03.302 --> 1:02:04.762
- Well, yeah, why is that?

1:02:04.762 --> 1:02:06.222
- 'Cause if you piss me off,

1:02:06.222 --> 1:02:07.598
you won't hear my proposal.

1:02:10.643 --> 1:02:11.477
- What proposal?

1:02:15.273 --> 1:02:16.232
- First champagne.

1:02:17.567 --> 1:02:18.443
Rabboni.

1:02:18.443 --> 1:02:19.235
- Yes, Daddy.

1:02:21.863 --> 1:02:24.449
Daddy, I just wanted to say,

1:02:24.449 --> 1:02:25.783
it's very kind of you to allow me

1:02:25.783 --> 1:02:27.243
to join you this evening.

1:02:27.243 --> 1:02:30.079
Your auspiciousness, it's truly touching.

1:02:30.079 --> 1:02:32.457
- So you're not with the whites?

1:02:32.457 --> 1:02:35.626
- He's with the church but
not all is what it seems.

1:02:39.505 --> 1:02:41.382
First, a toast.

1:02:41.382 --> 1:02:42.467
To new friendships.

1:02:42.467 --> 1:02:43.801
- To new friendships.

1:02:51.058 --> 1:02:54.353
- Jeremiah, great deceiver,

1:02:54.353 --> 1:02:55.897
you know I've always liked you.

1:02:58.149 --> 1:02:59.859
- Who are you?

1:02:59.859 --> 1:03:01.861
- Treachery is close to my heart,

1:03:01.861 --> 1:03:03.154
as are you.

1:03:03.154 --> 1:03:05.072
You know your needs are a lot more simple

1:03:05.072 --> 1:03:07.283
than the average mortal man.

1:03:07.283 --> 1:03:09.327
I wouldn't of gone into
poverty personally.

1:03:13.206 --> 1:03:14.290
So the whites and their boss

1:03:14.290 --> 1:03:16.083
have offered you a million, yeah?

1:03:16.083 --> 1:03:17.585
It's chump change.

1:03:17.585 --> 1:03:21.631
How 'bout a billion to
come over to our side?

1:03:21.631 --> 1:03:22.632
- A billion?

1:03:23.800 --> 1:03:25.218
- Pounds sterling.

1:03:25.218 --> 1:03:28.137
Could take it home tonight.

1:03:28.137 --> 1:03:31.557
- Jeremiah, did you ever consider acting?

1:03:34.310 --> 1:03:35.144
- What?

1:03:36.103 --> 1:03:36.896
- Acting.

1:03:37.814 --> 1:03:40.441
Hollywood, show business.

1:03:42.443 --> 1:03:44.695
With your jawline,

1:03:44.695 --> 1:03:46.364
you could go straight to the top.

1:03:49.116 --> 1:03:52.537
And daddy could guarantee it, personally.

1:03:55.206 --> 1:03:56.541
The money, fame.

1:04:00.044 --> 1:04:01.337
The awards.

1:04:01.337 --> 1:04:03.214
- I know all the top producers.

1:04:03.214 --> 1:04:06.133
All the biggest agents work for me.

1:04:06.133 --> 1:04:08.553
- Yeah and who might you be?

1:04:11.430 --> 1:04:14.433
- I think you already know
the answer to that question.

1:04:20.857 --> 1:04:23.985
- Jolie, dear sweet Jolie.

1:04:26.153 --> 1:04:28.906
It's obvious why you came, innit?

1:04:28.906 --> 1:04:30.449
The only man you've ever loved.

1:04:31.576 --> 1:04:33.870
The only man that's ever loved you.

1:04:33.870 --> 1:04:35.371
- Mickey.

1:04:35.371 --> 1:04:38.165
- Yeah, Mickey.

1:04:38.165 --> 1:04:39.792
I can make it happen.

1:04:39.792 --> 1:04:41.210
- He can make it happen.

1:04:43.713 --> 1:04:44.714
- It's impossible.

1:04:45.882 --> 1:04:46.674
- Is it?

1:04:50.261 --> 1:04:51.888
(people screaming)

1:04:51.888 --> 1:04:53.180
- Oh my god, baby.

1:04:53.180 --> 1:04:55.308
(sobbing)

1:05:02.440 --> 1:05:05.902
- Oh, looks like I've got Jolie's answer.

1:05:05.902 --> 1:05:07.111
So how 'bout you?

1:05:07.111 --> 1:05:10.990
Although, I don't think
you'll like the alternative.

1:05:14.952 --> 1:05:15.828
(sobbing)

1:05:15.828 --> 1:05:16.662
- No, no.

1:05:18.080 --> 1:05:20.249
(sobbing)

1:05:29.842 --> 1:05:31.427
That's not my Mickey.

1:05:31.427 --> 1:05:34.221
- He can be whoever you want him to be.

1:05:34.221 --> 1:05:36.098
- That's not my Mickey.

1:05:37.099 --> 1:05:38.434
I know my Mickey.

1:05:38.434 --> 1:05:40.686
(gunshots)

1:05:45.775 --> 1:05:48.027
(laughing)

1:05:49.403 --> 1:05:51.948
- Did you really think it
would be that fucking easy?

1:05:52.823 --> 1:05:54.492
Charge them both

1:05:54.492 --> 1:05:57.036
for the charge of
attempted murder, treason,

1:05:57.036 --> 1:05:58.704
and the attempt to halt the advancement

1:05:58.704 --> 1:06:00.831
of the New World Order.

1:06:00.831 --> 1:06:02.833
I sentence you both to death,

1:06:02.833 --> 1:06:04.585
torture by crucifixion.

1:06:04.585 --> 1:06:06.837
(laughing)

1:06:21.686 --> 1:06:24.689
(chuckles)

1:06:24.689 --> 1:06:27.525
(screaming)

1:06:27.525 --> 1:06:28.442
(shushing)

1:06:28.442 --> 1:06:29.276
- It wasn't that bad, come on,

1:06:29.276 --> 1:06:30.111
it wasn't that bad, was it?

1:06:30.111 --> 1:06:31.696
It wasn't that bad at all.

1:06:31.696 --> 1:06:32.989
I think you're exaggerating
just a little bit.

1:06:32.989 --> 1:06:36.158
I do think, I believe
you are exaggerating.

1:06:36.158 --> 1:06:41.163
(tense music)
(people laughing)

1:06:47.920 --> 1:06:51.298
(tense classical music)

1:07:07.857 --> 1:07:09.025
- [Narrator] I failed in my mission

1:07:09.025 --> 1:07:11.110
to rescue the boy from the forces of evil

1:07:11.110 --> 1:07:12.820
and get rich in the process.

1:07:14.113 --> 1:07:15.156
He'll be raised by Satan now

1:07:15.156 --> 1:07:17.074
and the next generation will be doomed.

1:07:19.660 --> 1:07:21.412
Feminists will castrate young men

1:07:21.412 --> 1:07:23.581
and their masculinity in droves

1:07:23.581 --> 1:07:25.124
and the New World Order shall continue

1:07:25.124 --> 1:07:27.084
to run the world with its policies.

1:07:28.044 --> 1:07:29.128
(glass shattering)

1:07:29.128 --> 1:07:32.465
(tense classical music)

1:07:35.051 --> 1:07:36.343
The boy's innocence was gone

1:07:36.343 --> 1:07:38.429
and he was now guilty as the rest of us.

1:07:44.518 --> 1:07:46.270
- [Devil] Last chance
to change your minds.

1:07:46.270 --> 1:07:47.146
- Fuck you.

1:07:48.064 --> 1:07:49.356
(laughing)

1:07:49.356 --> 1:07:51.400
- How 'bout you Jeremiah?

1:07:51.400 --> 1:07:52.234
Join me.

1:07:52.234 --> 1:07:54.695
We'll have some fun, I promise.

1:07:54.695 --> 1:07:56.072
- I'll do it.

1:07:56.072 --> 1:07:59.575
I'll do it!

1:07:59.575 --> 1:08:00.993
I'll, I'll do it!

1:08:02.411 --> 1:08:04.789
(screaming)

1:08:06.123 --> 1:08:07.958
- You fucking traitor.

1:08:08.959 --> 1:08:10.419
- I knew you'd see the light.

1:08:10.419 --> 1:08:12.171
Untie Jeremiah.

1:08:12.171 --> 1:08:17.176
(dramatic classical music)
(evil laughter)

1:08:35.945 --> 1:08:39.532
(dramatic classical music)

1:08:50.417 --> 1:08:53.254
- [Narrator] Jolie refused to
sell her soul to the devil.

1:08:54.547 --> 1:08:55.589
But Jolie had won.

1:08:56.674 --> 1:08:58.843
Her will and defiance in the face of evil

1:08:58.843 --> 1:09:01.011
meant she was indeed
reunited with her soulmate

1:09:01.011 --> 1:09:02.680
and one true love Mickey.

1:09:04.265 --> 1:09:05.850
Jolie fought Satan in hell

1:09:06.767 --> 1:09:08.435
and she was victorious.

1:09:10.855 --> 1:09:12.606
As for me, I ran.

1:09:12.606 --> 1:09:14.692
I ran and I jumped and I swam as fast

1:09:14.692 --> 1:09:15.568
as I could off that island

1:09:15.568 --> 1:09:17.444
to me grandfather's big old house

1:09:17.444 --> 1:09:18.445
that I was raised in.

1:09:19.613 --> 1:09:21.782
He belonged to a different
generation to me,

1:09:21.782 --> 1:09:24.660
and he saw the world through vintage lens.

1:09:24.660 --> 1:09:26.328
But there's a maternal feel

1:09:26.328 --> 1:09:27.955
about the home you raised in

1:09:27.955 --> 1:09:29.707
that pulls you towards its bosom

1:09:29.707 --> 1:09:31.876
when the times are their worst.

1:09:31.876 --> 1:09:36.005
- An agreement is quite
something special, isn't it?

1:09:37.298 --> 1:09:39.550
You can't forget that, can you?

1:09:40.593 --> 1:09:41.510
No, no, no, no, no.

1:09:43.179 --> 1:09:46.640
(muffled shouting)

1:09:46.640 --> 1:09:48.726
Now, by tomorrow morning,

1:09:51.353 --> 1:09:56.358
you will receive a billion
pounds in your bank account.

1:09:59.236 --> 1:10:02.072
So just, just relax.

1:10:02.072 --> 1:10:05.743
Yes, relax.

1:10:05.743 --> 1:10:07.369
Relax, my boy.

1:10:07.369 --> 1:10:08.204
Yes.

1:10:08.204 --> 1:10:09.914
Yes, just relax.

1:10:10.998 --> 1:10:11.957
Yes, you relax.

1:10:13.042 --> 1:10:14.126
That's right.

1:10:14.126 --> 1:10:17.338
You're in safe hands now.

1:10:17.338 --> 1:10:19.673
After all, we are soulmates.

1:10:26.680 --> 1:10:28.599
- [Narrator] Everyone has a price.

1:10:28.599 --> 1:10:30.267
So when you meet the
devil at the crossroads

1:10:30.267 --> 1:10:32.728
and sell your soul to Satan,

1:10:32.728 --> 1:10:34.980
the biggest mistake you can ever do

1:10:34.980 --> 1:10:36.065
is regret it.

1:10:36.982 --> 1:10:40.236
