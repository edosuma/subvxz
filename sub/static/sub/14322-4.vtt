00:01.416 --> 00:02.583
Previously onX-Men...

00:05.833 --> 00:10.166
I... am... Phoenix!

00:10.166 --> 00:11.375
Jean!

00:11.375 --> 00:13.000
It is good that you are here.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.583
-Help me to prepare the others.
-For what?

00:15.583 --> 00:19.708
In our hands lies the fate of
a billion star systems,

00:19.708 --> 00:21.875
of lives beyond measure.

00:21.875 --> 00:25.000
Unlock the power of the M'Kraan

00:25.000 --> 00:27.416
and make the galaxy mine!

00:27.416 --> 00:28.750
Stop!

00:28.750 --> 00:31.875
I am the guardian of
the crystal.

00:31.875 --> 00:35.125
The galaxy is mine to destroy.

00:35.125 --> 00:38.166
[Jean] The power has
destroyed you, D'Ken.

00:38.166 --> 00:41.500
The galaxy shall not
share your fate.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.875
The crystal is sealed,

00:42.875 --> 00:44.583
but the only way to guarantee

00:44.583 --> 00:47.333
that its power
will never be released again

00:47.333 --> 00:51.250
is for me to take it
beyond the reach of
any living being.

00:51.250 --> 00:53.333
[Scott] You could be
locked in here forever.

00:53.333 --> 00:55.458
I'm only doing
what must be done.

00:55.458 --> 00:57.083
I'm coming with you.

00:57.083 --> 00:59.458
You can't be a part of
where I'm going.

00:59.458 --> 01:01.958
Good-bye, my friends.
I love you all.

01:01.958 --> 01:03.458
Good-bye, Scott.

01:04.166 --> 01:05.583
Good-bye, my love.

01:05.583 --> 01:06.875
[Jean] The light.

01:07.583 --> 01:09.208
Oh, Scott,

01:09.208 --> 01:11.375
if only you could see it.

01:11.375 --> 01:12.583
Jean...

01:13.000 --> 01:15.833
[opening theme playing]

01:47.166 --> 01:49.708
[Beast] "And when its
turbulent journey endeth,

01:49.708 --> 01:52.166
the river flows into the sea.

01:52.166 --> 01:53.958
At peace now

01:53.958 --> 01:55.625
for all eternity."

01:56.875 --> 01:58.375
[Rogue sniffles]

01:58.375 --> 02:00.875
That was really nice, Hank.
[sniffles]

02:00.875 --> 02:02.708
And most appropriate.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.833
Jean loved poetry.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.416
Didn't she, Scott?

02:10.250 --> 02:13.291
We all know the risks of
being an X-Man.

02:13.291 --> 02:14.583
Jean knew them well.

02:14.583 --> 02:16.375
I think this
whole thing is sick.

02:16.375 --> 02:19.291
You're all acting like
Jean's never coming back.

02:20.875 --> 02:22.291
But, sugar...

02:23.208 --> 02:24.500
Maybe she's alive.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.208
Did you ever think of that?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.625
[sobbing]

02:29.625 --> 02:31.125
Let it out, baby.

02:32.208 --> 02:33.291
Let it out.

02:40.250 --> 02:41.708
I miss you.

02:41.708 --> 02:43.583
I never knew how much I would.

02:43.583 --> 02:45.375
We all miss her, Scott.

02:45.375 --> 02:46.750
The question is,

02:46.750 --> 02:48.583
how will we move on without her?

02:48.583 --> 02:51.875
What's important now
is that we carry on

02:51.875 --> 02:54.583
so that Jean's great sacrifice

02:54.583 --> 02:56.083
won't have been in vain.

02:56.083 --> 02:58.250
To save a world
full of prejudice?

02:58.250 --> 02:59.750
Where humans hate us.
Is that it?

02:59.750 --> 03:01.458
Hate and fear are
what we're fighting

03:01.458 --> 03:03.458
to overcome, you know that.

03:03.458 --> 03:05.000
A lot of things I thought I knew

03:05.000 --> 03:07.166
aren't so clear to me anymore.

03:07.166 --> 03:08.958
You are in pain, Scott.

03:08.958 --> 03:11.833
Perhaps worse than any of us
can understand.

03:11.833 --> 03:14.083
But in time, this feeling will--

03:14.083 --> 03:15.416
Don't you get it?

03:15.416 --> 03:17.875
I'm sick of the responsibility!

03:17.875 --> 03:19.458
I'm sick of being den mother

03:19.458 --> 03:21.458
to a bunch of
quibbling children!

03:21.458 --> 03:22.875
I can't do it anymore!

03:23.500 --> 03:24.750
Most of all

03:25.250 --> 03:27.083
I'm sick of caring.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.166
I cared for Jean.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.083
Look where that got me.

03:36.375 --> 03:37.708
Here, Professor.

03:37.708 --> 03:40.625
I won't be needing
these anymore.

03:40.625 --> 03:42.291
Scott, please!

03:53.625 --> 03:55.458
[Scott]
Jean, I've been wondering...

03:55.458 --> 03:56.958
Yes?

03:56.958 --> 03:59.083
I've been wondering,
will you marry me?

03:59.083 --> 04:01.333
-Cyclops...
-Well?

04:01.333 --> 04:04.333
If we have children,
they'll be mutants.

04:04.333 --> 04:08.125
They'll face the same problems
we have all their lives.

04:09.708 --> 04:12.125
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

04:13.250 --> 04:14.833
[boy] Die, mutant!

04:17.291 --> 04:18.875
Johnny, stop that.

04:18.875 --> 04:20.750
That's real impolite.

04:20.750 --> 04:24.583
But, Ma, I'm just playing
good guys and mutants.

04:24.583 --> 04:26.708
Well, I'm sure
that nice young man

04:26.708 --> 04:28.875
doesn't appreciate
being called a mutant.

04:35.708 --> 04:37.166
[girl] Scott's it!

04:38.000 --> 04:40.333
[groans] My head!

04:48.125 --> 04:50.625
[woman] Can I help you?
Excuse me.

04:50.625 --> 04:53.291
Are you all right?
Are you here about an adoption?

04:53.291 --> 04:54.500
Oh, no, I was just...

04:55.000 --> 04:56.208
I used to live here.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.708
Scott... Summers?

04:59.708 --> 05:02.125
Yes, but how did... Sarah?

05:02.125 --> 05:04.333
It's so good to see you.

05:04.333 --> 05:06.583
It's been such a long time.

05:10.375 --> 05:12.291
So, after my husband died,

05:12.291 --> 05:14.875
I came back here as a volunteer.

05:14.875 --> 05:15.958
Now I run the place.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.500
What about you, Scott?

05:18.500 --> 05:20.208
-You never married?
-No.

05:20.208 --> 05:21.375
But there was someone,

05:21.375 --> 05:24.250
but... she's gone.

05:27.291 --> 05:30.375
And to top off a week
filled with charitable acts,

05:30.375 --> 05:33.875
Zebediah Killgrave pledged
full college scholarships

05:33.875 --> 05:35.875
to ten more
disadvantaged children.

05:35.875 --> 05:39.083
That is one of the finest men
who ever lived.

05:39.083 --> 05:41.708
I could never have
kept this place afloat
if not for him.

05:41.708 --> 05:44.000
Not only has Mr. Killgrave
given us money,

05:44.000 --> 05:46.708
but he adopted
four of my special kids.

05:46.708 --> 05:48.333
When you say "special"...

05:48.333 --> 05:49.750
I mean "mutants," Scott.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.583
Nobody else wanted
to adopt them.

05:51.583 --> 05:54.000
[woman] We just feel
Scott would be better off

05:54.000 --> 05:55.500
with another family.

05:55.500 --> 05:58.458
He has... such special needs.

05:59.416 --> 06:02.875
A child like that
shouldn't be allowed
near other children.

06:02.875 --> 06:05.333
You should have warned us
he wasn't normal.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.583
[alarm beeping]

06:16.583 --> 06:18.875
Fire! The children!

06:25.000 --> 06:27.416
Quickly, children, downstairs!

06:51.166 --> 06:52.166
Hey, you!

06:54.458 --> 06:57.291
I didn't mean to do it.
It was an accident.

06:57.291 --> 06:59.083
What were you doing,
playing with matches?

06:59.625 --> 07:01.125
People could have been hurt.

07:01.125 --> 07:02.458
Let him go, Scott.

07:03.416 --> 07:05.166
I'm sorry, Sarah.

07:05.166 --> 07:08.208
Rusty is one of the special kids
I told you about.

07:08.208 --> 07:11.000
He was adopted by Mr. Killgrave
two days ago.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.416
Don't make me go back.

07:12.416 --> 07:15.500
-Please!
-But Rusty, what's wrong?

07:15.500 --> 07:18.333
Can't anybody stop this?

07:18.333 --> 07:20.125
Let me talk to him, Sarah.

07:20.750 --> 07:23.416
I know you didn't mean
to set that fire, Rusty.

07:23.416 --> 07:25.208
You've got a mutant power.

07:25.625 --> 07:27.000
It takes time
to learn how to use it.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.458
What are you,

07:28.458 --> 07:31.125
some kind of do-gooder
social worker?

07:36.416 --> 07:38.083
You're a mutant.

07:38.083 --> 07:41.000
Then, you know what it's like.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.083
I also know
what it's like growing up

07:43.083 --> 07:45.583
without a home, without parents.

07:45.583 --> 07:48.375
You're fortunate
that someone wants to
give you all that.

07:48.375 --> 07:50.583
I couldn't have made it
without help from friends

07:50.583 --> 07:52.083
that cared about me.

07:52.083 --> 07:53.708
Killgrave is bad news.

07:53.708 --> 07:55.708
I'm telling you, he's wacko.

07:55.708 --> 07:57.750
Maybe you just need
to get used to him.

07:57.750 --> 07:59.416
But I heard him talking about
how he's gonna use

07:59.416 --> 08:00.958
this big new project

08:00.958 --> 08:02.583
to run the governor
out of office.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.583
And he's got a torture chamber
In his basement.

08:05.583 --> 08:07.750
What are you saying?

08:07.750 --> 08:09.875
Scott, you don't have to
listen to this anymore.

08:10.416 --> 08:12.208
Go inside, Rusty.

08:12.208 --> 08:14.958
Nobody ever believes me!

08:14.958 --> 08:17.625
After all Mr. Killgrave
has done for you,

08:17.625 --> 08:19.375
you make up these lies?

08:19.375 --> 08:21.375
Could there be any truth
to what he's saying?

08:21.375 --> 08:23.250
-You don't know this kid, Scott.
-[siren wailing]

08:23.250 --> 08:25.375
He's lied, he's stolen

08:25.375 --> 08:27.000
He's been in trouble
with the police.

08:34.583 --> 08:37.166
He's here, isn't he?

08:37.625 --> 08:39.708
Please don't make me go back.

08:42.083 --> 08:45.208
Rusty's having some problems
adjusting, Mr. Killgrave.

08:45.208 --> 08:47.208
Maybe if he stayed here
for a few days--

08:47.208 --> 08:48.458
Now, Sarah,

08:48.458 --> 08:50.083
we've been through this before

08:50.083 --> 08:52.083
with other "special children."

08:52.083 --> 08:55.083
We agreed that
a clean break was best.

08:55.083 --> 08:56.583
But I'm only talking about--

08:56.583 --> 08:58.083
You know what I think of you

08:58.083 --> 09:00.333
and the wonderful work
you do here.

09:00.333 --> 09:02.166
You've been more than generous.

09:02.166 --> 09:05.208
It would be a shame
If this little misunderstanding

09:05.208 --> 09:07.750
caused me to feel differently.

09:07.750 --> 09:10.250
Sir, the boy seems scared.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.708
Does he have any reason to be?

09:11.708 --> 09:13.000
Why, no.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.833
Not having a father,

09:14.833 --> 09:17.875
he's just not used to
the loving discipline

09:17.875 --> 09:20.291
a boy his age needs.

09:21.458 --> 09:22.875
Rusty?

09:22.875 --> 09:24.500
You go back with Mr. Killgrave.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.333
My boy.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.375
You had me so worried.

09:34.583 --> 09:36.750
After only two days

09:36.750 --> 09:39.583
I already love you like a son.

09:44.583 --> 09:45.833
Back to your work!

09:46.416 --> 09:48.625
No! You can't make me!

09:49.583 --> 09:52.000
Obey me!

09:52.000 --> 09:53.833
No... I...

09:53.833 --> 09:56.125
The future is now.

09:56.125 --> 09:58.083
We will be respected.

09:58.083 --> 10:00.958
We will overcome their hatred.

10:00.958 --> 10:04.708
Through strength, we will lead.

10:04.708 --> 10:07.083
The future is now.

10:07.083 --> 10:09.000
We will be respected.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.958
We will overcome their hatred.

10:11.958 --> 10:15.458
Through strength, we will lead.

10:15.458 --> 10:17.875
[kids] The future is now.

10:18.375 --> 10:20.583
We will be respected.

10:20.583 --> 10:23.000
The future is now.

10:23.416 --> 10:25.958
We will be respected.

10:25.958 --> 10:28.958
We will overcome their hatred.

10:28.958 --> 10:31.500
Through strength, we will lead.

10:32.250 --> 10:33.625
We will be respected...

10:33.625 --> 10:36.416
You have a special
purpose, Rusty.

10:36.416 --> 10:39.000
You are one of the chosen.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.291
Soon, you will not
hide your powers.

10:41.291 --> 10:44.375
You won't deny who you are
just to be accepted.

10:44.375 --> 10:47.458
You will be the politicians,
the bankers,

10:47.458 --> 10:49.458
the community leaders!

10:49.458 --> 10:51.875
The American dream
will become a reality

10:51.875 --> 10:54.833
For every mutant, young and old.

10:55.291 --> 10:57.875
And when we're in charge,

10:57.875 --> 11:01.333
we'll make them pay
for the way they've treated us!

11:04.000 --> 11:05.875
[kids] The future is now.

11:05.875 --> 11:07.625
We will be respected.

11:07.625 --> 11:10.458
The future is now.

11:10.458 --> 11:12.708
We will be respected.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.250
And now, my young friends,

11:17.250 --> 11:21.291
it's time to pay a little visit
to the capital building.

11:22.416 --> 11:25.458
You, Taki, will use your
wheelchair transformation power

11:25.458 --> 11:27.166
to gain access.

11:32.250 --> 11:34.875
Skids and Boom Boom,
you will hold off the guards.

11:44.083 --> 11:46.458
[gasps and screams]

11:52.875 --> 11:55.083
And, Rusty, you'll provide me

11:55.083 --> 11:57.875
with that
extra sense of security.

12:10.333 --> 12:13.416
While I pay a visit
to the governor.

12:16.708 --> 12:20.291
-Killgrave?
-You know what I want, Governor.

12:20.291 --> 12:22.000
A Platte River project.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.333
Obey me.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.166
Thanks for staying
to help us out.

12:31.583 --> 12:33.416
How was it sleeping
on the couch?

12:33.416 --> 12:34.583
Lumpy.

12:35.875 --> 12:37.708
That's the first time
I've seen you smile.

12:37.708 --> 12:39.333
Who's Jean?

12:39.333 --> 12:41.083
You cried her name out
In your sleep.

12:41.083 --> 12:43.250
Was she the woman you...
spoke of?

12:44.208 --> 12:45.291
Yes.

12:45.875 --> 12:47.208
Jean was my...

12:47.583 --> 12:49.416
Was someone I loved.

12:49.416 --> 12:50.583
Sorry.

12:50.583 --> 12:52.000
[stammering] I didn't mean to...

12:52.000 --> 12:53.458
No. It's okay.

12:53.458 --> 12:56.000
I just don't know
how to talk about it yet.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.250
It'll be all right.

12:57.250 --> 12:58.708
No. [stammering]

12:58.708 --> 13:01.250
Look, you've been
really kind to me, Sarah,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.250
-but I should go.
-[woman on TV]
We interrupt this broadcast

13:04.250 --> 13:06.458
to bring you
a News Nine Special Report.

13:06.458 --> 13:09.250
-[kids] Oh, no.
-Governor Barkley has announced

13:09.250 --> 13:11.000
he's resigning from office,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.416
citing health problems
as the cause.

13:13.416 --> 13:17.000
This will likely bode well
for Zebediah Killgrave,

13:17.000 --> 13:19.291
since the governor
has led the opposition

13:19.291 --> 13:21.208
to Killgrave's bid to control

13:21.208 --> 13:23.125
the multi-billion-dollar
hydroelectric facility...

13:23.125 --> 13:24.500
Maybe rusty was right.

13:25.291 --> 13:26.625
We've got to get the kids.

13:32.625 --> 13:34.291
[Sarah]
That's Killgrave's house.

13:34.291 --> 13:36.583
I still can't believe
that a man like him

13:36.583 --> 13:38.875
could be involved
in anything criminal.

13:38.875 --> 13:40.000
You may be right, Sarah,

13:40.000 --> 13:41.250
but we can't take the chance.

13:43.583 --> 13:45.625
Wait here. It may not be safe.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.166
But if the kids are in danger--

13:47.166 --> 13:49.416
Wait here.
I want to see Killgrave.

14:11.250 --> 14:12.875
I want to see Killgrave.

14:13.750 --> 14:15.083
It's all right, Wayne.

14:16.375 --> 14:18.375
You're Sarah's friend.

14:18.375 --> 14:19.750
Scott summers.

14:19.750 --> 14:21.166
I have reason to believe

14:21.166 --> 14:22.458
Rusty and the others
are in danger.

14:22.458 --> 14:23.875
Danger?

14:23.875 --> 14:25.750
Whatever would
give you that idea?

14:26.583 --> 14:29.333
As you can see,
they're all perfectly safe.

14:29.333 --> 14:32.625
I encourage the children
to improve their minds.

14:33.125 --> 14:36.166
Children, say hello
to Mr. Summers.

14:36.583 --> 14:38.958
[speaking woodenly]
Hello, Mr. Summers.

14:38.958 --> 14:41.250
With discipline and hard work,

14:41.250 --> 14:44.291
they will be the future leaders
of our community.

14:45.125 --> 14:46.125
Rusty?

14:48.000 --> 14:50.458
-Would you like a cookie?
-Are you okay?

14:50.458 --> 14:52.958
Of course.
Everything's fine now.

14:52.958 --> 14:55.291
I was wrong about Mr. Killgrave.

14:59.291 --> 15:00.375
[screams]

15:02.166 --> 15:03.583
Dump him out back.

15:04.083 --> 15:06.875
[ groaning]

15:07.708 --> 15:09.500
I've got
a press conference to hold.

15:29.208 --> 15:30.875
-Scott.
-Jean.

15:36.583 --> 15:39.708
-[coughing]
-Thank goodness.

15:43.083 --> 15:45.708
-[groans]
-When I saw Killgrave drive off,

15:45.708 --> 15:47.458
I thought something
might be wrong.

15:47.458 --> 15:49.958
-Were the kids with him?
-I don't think so.

15:49.958 --> 15:51.000
The basement!

15:51.416 --> 15:52.958
I hope we're not too late.

15:54.250 --> 15:57.333
Welcome to the final stage of
your training.

15:57.333 --> 16:01.208
After this, you will always
be part of our family.

16:01.208 --> 16:04.208
[all] We hear, and we obey.

16:05.958 --> 16:08.875
Everything Killgrave
has taught you is a lie.

16:12.500 --> 16:16.000
Acceptance must be earned,
not forced on people.

16:16.458 --> 16:17.958
Are you kids all right?

16:18.833 --> 16:21.125
Sarah, can we go home now?

16:21.583 --> 16:23.583
Of course we can, darling.

16:26.708 --> 16:28.958
How could I have been
so foolish?

16:28.958 --> 16:30.583
Don't blame yourself, Sarah.

16:30.583 --> 16:33.208
The whole state's
been taken in by this guy.

16:33.208 --> 16:34.833
Whatever hold he has
on the children,

16:34.833 --> 16:36.375
evidently isn't total.

16:36.375 --> 16:38.333
Let's get all the kids
somewhere safe.

16:38.333 --> 16:41.000
The press and the authorities
should be here any minute.

16:41.708 --> 16:45.208
Sarah, when I...
used my mutant powers

16:45.208 --> 16:48.375
back at Killgrave's,
you weren't shocked.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.583
No. I already knew.

16:50.583 --> 16:51.625
But when did you...

16:51.625 --> 16:52.875
I've known since that day

16:52.875 --> 16:54.375
back when we were kids.

17:02.083 --> 17:04.416
When the others
were so cruel to you.

17:05.375 --> 17:07.416
When no one would adopt you.

17:07.416 --> 17:09.708
But you never made me feel
like an outcast,

17:10.458 --> 17:11.708
Like the others did.

17:11.708 --> 17:13.333
It didn't matter to me, Scott.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.125
You were always my friend.

17:15.125 --> 17:18.083
-Sarah, I...
-[helicopter rotors whirring]

17:23.125 --> 17:26.166
Sarah, I know
you have my children.

17:26.166 --> 17:28.125
They're not yours anymore.

17:28.125 --> 17:30.208
You're making a big mistake.

17:30.208 --> 17:31.708
No, Killgrave.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.208
You're the one
making the mistake.

17:35.208 --> 17:37.583
I should have made sure
I was rid of you

17:37.583 --> 17:38.958
when I had the chance.

17:46.083 --> 17:48.708
Grab your camera, Bill.
I gotta have this.

17:52.125 --> 17:54.875
Humans like Sarah hate mutants.

17:55.375 --> 17:58.000
I'll teach you to turn your back
on your own kind.

17:59.333 --> 18:01.000
[groaning]

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
On your knees!

18:03.958 --> 18:07.750
Yours is the only hatred
I feel, Killgrave.

18:07.750 --> 18:10.000
As long as I'm alive,

18:10.000 --> 18:12.166
you'll never get these children.

18:12.166 --> 18:14.125
It's too late.

18:14.125 --> 18:16.958
I already own them.

18:17.416 --> 18:18.625
Rusty!

18:18.625 --> 18:20.708
Obey me.

18:24.250 --> 18:25.416
Scott!

18:25.416 --> 18:26.958
No!

18:27.833 --> 18:30.500
Won't... let you!

18:32.875 --> 18:34.125
[both groan]

18:38.708 --> 18:40.875
Taki! He's still inside!

18:41.333 --> 18:43.083
Sarah! No!

18:43.708 --> 18:46.208
No! Not again!

18:55.375 --> 18:56.458
[gasping]

19:05.291 --> 19:07.083
Let's get it on the air.

19:10.458 --> 19:12.083
It's all gone, Sarah.

19:12.083 --> 19:13.375
What will you do?

19:13.375 --> 19:15.583
Rebuild. What else can I do?

19:15.583 --> 19:17.833
This is my home, where I belong.

19:17.833 --> 19:20.000
These kids are my family.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.083
There's a place here
for you as well, Scott,
if you want it.

19:23.083 --> 19:24.875
Part of me does, Sarah

19:24.875 --> 19:27.875
But helping you and the children
made me realize

19:27.875 --> 19:30.250
that there's another place
where I belong

19:30.875 --> 19:32.458
where I'm also needed.

19:37.708 --> 19:39.000
Scott.

19:41.416 --> 19:42.625
Professor.

19:42.625 --> 19:45.166
[alarm sounding]

19:45.166 --> 19:47.083
It's Cerebro's autoscan.

19:47.083 --> 19:48.458
It's found something.

19:50.458 --> 19:51.958
She's alive.

19:54.125 --> 19:55.250
Jean!

19:57.208 --> 19:58.583
Fascinating.

19:58.583 --> 20:00.166
[Scott] I miss you.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.166
[closing theme playing]
