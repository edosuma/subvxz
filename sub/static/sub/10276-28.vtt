00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:09.443 --> 00:12.544
¶ I was a girl in the village
doing all right ¶

00:12.546 --> 00:14.813
¶ Then I became
a princess overnight ¶

00:14.815 --> 00:17.549
¶ Now I gotta figure out
how to do it right ¶

00:17.551 --> 00:19.885
¶ So much to learn
and see ¶

00:19.887 --> 00:22.521
¶ Up in the castle
with my new family ¶

00:22.523 --> 00:25.391
¶ In a school that's
just for royalty ¶

00:25.393 --> 00:29.361
¶ A whole enchanted world
is waiting for me ¶

00:29.363 --> 00:33.399
- ¶ I'm so excited to be ¶
- ¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:33.401 --> 00:36.402
¶ I'm finding out what
being royal's all about ¶

00:36.404 --> 00:38.070
¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:38.072 --> 00:40.506
¶ Making my way,
it's an adventure every day ¶

00:40.508 --> 00:42.908
¶ Sofia ¶

00:42.910 --> 00:45.411
- ¶ It's gonna be my time ¶
- ¶ Sofia ¶

00:45.413 --> 00:51.583
¶ To show them all
that I'm Sofia the first ¶

01:00.361 --> 01:03.395
( playing upbeat tempo )

01:05.366 --> 01:07.533
Wow. They're really good.

01:07.535 --> 01:10.235
¶ ¶

01:11.405 --> 01:14.006
Thank you,
Junior Knight Academy,

01:14.008 --> 01:15.841
for your valiant
performance!

01:15.843 --> 01:17.743
Let's see how
the judges
scored you.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.278
Flambeau.

01:20.614 --> 01:23.248
Oh, a nine out of ten.
That's excellent.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.517
And now,
Crankle the Ogre.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.288
Fourteen.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.623
Another nine.
Well done.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.425
And last but not least,

01:33.427 --> 01:36.795
the most famous magical
musician in all the kingdoms,

01:36.797 --> 01:38.964
Baron Von Rocha!

01:38.966 --> 01:42.201
Most famous
and most talented.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.870
Now, Baron, how do you
score the band?

01:44.872 --> 01:49.208
With my usual combination
of flair and panache, of course.

01:49.210 --> 01:53.612
I give them an eight
out of ten.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.081
I can't believe one of
our judges is Baron Von Rocha.

01:56.083 --> 01:59.051
I've been to every one of
his magical music concerts.

01:59.053 --> 02:01.987
Now, the final act to perform

02:01.989 --> 02:04.490
at our school band
showdown will be...

02:04.492 --> 02:06.425
the Royal Prep Band!

02:06.427 --> 02:08.460
It's your turn,
children.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.462
Ready, guys?

02:10.464 --> 02:12.297
ALL: We're the band
that sticks together.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.566
Royal Prep's
the best band ever!

02:15.803 --> 02:18.370
( applause )

02:26.080 --> 02:30.015
( playing spirited tune )

02:43.831 --> 02:45.264
That mandolin player...

02:45.266 --> 02:48.133
she is truly
talented.

02:48.135 --> 02:49.501
( squawks )

02:53.107 --> 02:54.806
Splendid job.

02:54.808 --> 02:57.376
Judges, show us your scores.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.145
That's an eight
from Flambeau.

03:00.147 --> 03:02.447
A seven from Crankle.

03:02.449 --> 03:05.017
Baron, what about you?

03:05.019 --> 03:07.986
Today, it was I who witnessed
the magic.

03:07.988 --> 03:11.723
I give this band
a ten!

03:13.327 --> 03:15.260
Excuse me.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.902
A perfect score
from the baron.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.571
How about that!

03:25.573 --> 03:28.874
And now, the results
of tonight's showdown.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.710
In third place,
Westloch.

03:31.712 --> 03:35.047
Second place goes to
Royal Prep.

03:36.584 --> 03:41.587
And our winners are
the Junior Knights Academy!

03:41.589 --> 03:43.555
Thanks to all the bands
who participated,

03:43.557 --> 03:45.757
and we'll see you
at the next showdown.

03:45.759 --> 03:49.261
Piccolo, did you see
how my magic almost failed me?

03:49.263 --> 03:52.698
My adoring fans
expect me to be the very best.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.734
I must replenish my magic,

03:55.736 --> 03:58.403
and that girl
who plays the mandolin

03:58.405 --> 04:01.340
just might be the key.

04:01.342 --> 04:04.076
Oh, children,
I'm so proud of you.

04:04.078 --> 04:06.378
Do you like the uniforms
I designed, Miss Merriweather?

04:06.380 --> 04:08.614
Oh, they're lovely,
Amber.

04:08.616 --> 04:11.250
Did you see the special move
Sofia and I worked out?

04:11.252 --> 04:12.784
We practiced it
for weeks.

04:12.786 --> 04:14.753
And it was
very charming.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.788
Baron: It certainly was.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.191
Piccolo and I have found
your school band's performance

04:19.193 --> 04:21.193
absolutely enchanting.

04:21.195 --> 04:23.629
- Didn't we, Piccolo?
- ( squawking )

04:23.631 --> 04:26.198
Oh, Baron Von Rocha,

04:26.200 --> 04:29.801
having you here
has truly been an honor.

04:29.803 --> 04:32.771
Yes, but what I came
backstage to say

04:32.773 --> 04:34.973
is that you,
Princess Vivian,

04:34.975 --> 04:37.643
are a singular talent.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.444
- Me?
- Yes, you.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.780
Would you perhaps
be interested

04:41.782 --> 04:43.715
in learning the art
of magical music?

04:45.786 --> 04:48.287
Wow! I've always wanted
to learn magical music.

04:48.289 --> 04:51.423
And I have always wanted
to teach it.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.558
My goodness,
Princess Vivian.

04:53.560 --> 04:56.428
What an incredible
opportunity.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.797
Um, Baron Von Rocha,

04:58.799 --> 05:01.967
learning magical music would be
a dream come true for me,

05:01.969 --> 05:04.936
but the thing is,
I'm a part of the band,

05:04.938 --> 05:06.438
and we stick together.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.107
Is there any way
you could teach all of us?

05:09.109 --> 05:12.344
Uh, that was not quite
what I had in mind,

05:12.346 --> 05:14.913
but yes, I could
teach all of you.

05:14.915 --> 05:17.316
( all cheering )

05:17.318 --> 05:20.852
Oh, wonderful!
Come to the school tomorrow,

05:20.854 --> 05:23.188
and I'll make sure you have
everything you need.

05:23.190 --> 05:24.823
I can't believe it.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.425
We're going to learn
magical music

05:26.427 --> 05:27.826
from Baron Von Rocha.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.095
We are the luckiest
band in the world.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.902
( Baron Von Rocha
playing )

05:38.639 --> 05:41.006
Wow! Are you gonna teach us
to do that?

05:41.008 --> 05:43.041
No, no, no, no, no.

05:43.043 --> 05:46.011
That is an advanced spell
that only someone with

05:46.013 --> 05:47.946
an enormous amount of
musical talent,

05:47.948 --> 05:49.681
like myself, can do.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.117
Well, we're all super excited
to learn anything

05:52.119 --> 05:54.720
- you can teach us.
- We can't wait.

05:54.722 --> 05:57.489
Excellent.
Then let us begin.

05:57.491 --> 06:01.693
¶ You could make this artwork
spin around inside its frame ¶

06:01.695 --> 06:04.363
¶ And then cause
those sunny skies ¶

06:04.365 --> 06:05.797
¶ To change to some rain ¶

06:05.799 --> 06:09.801
¶ You all could learn
to play magical music ¶

06:09.803 --> 06:13.572
¶ Strike up a spell
any time that you choose it ¶

06:13.574 --> 06:15.574
¶ With my special sheets ¶

06:15.576 --> 06:17.509
¶ You'll perform
major feats ¶

06:17.511 --> 06:21.747
¶ So pay close attention
for best comprehension ¶

06:21.749 --> 06:25.817
¶ Then you can feel
the magic ¶

06:25.819 --> 06:29.154
¶ All the magic
in the music ¶

06:29.156 --> 06:31.556
¶ I'll teach you
all you need to know ¶

06:31.558 --> 06:33.725
¶ With help from
my pal Piccolo ¶

06:33.727 --> 06:36.528
¶ The lesson's just begun ¶

06:36.530 --> 06:39.898
¶ So now
let's have some fun ¶

06:39.900 --> 06:46.438
¶ And feel the magic
in the music ¶

06:47.741 --> 06:49.908
Oh!

06:49.910 --> 06:53.779
¶ This old tune will let you
float so high up in the air ¶

06:53.781 --> 06:55.747
¶ Play each note exactly right ¶

06:55.749 --> 06:58.350
¶ For if you don't, beware ¶

06:58.352 --> 07:01.787
¶ One tiny slip-up
will make your spell fumble ¶

07:01.789 --> 07:05.424
¶ Then you'll be in for
a terrible tumble ¶

07:05.426 --> 07:07.626
¶ But practice with heart ¶

07:07.628 --> 07:09.961
¶ And you'll master this art ¶

07:09.963 --> 07:11.963
¶ And soon go from frazzled ¶

07:11.965 --> 07:13.865
¶ To razzled and dazzled ¶

07:13.867 --> 07:17.803
¶ Oh, I can feel the magic ¶

07:17.805 --> 07:21.640
¶ Oh, the magic in the music ¶

07:21.642 --> 07:23.875
¶ He'll teach us
all we need to know ¶

07:23.877 --> 07:25.977
¶ With the help of
good old Piccolo ¶

07:25.979 --> 07:27.946
¶ And we'll both
learn a ton ¶

07:27.948 --> 07:30.148
¶ Together we'll have fun ¶

07:30.150 --> 07:33.151
¶ Yes, you can feel
the magic ¶

07:33.153 --> 07:34.453
¶ The fun ¶

07:34.455 --> 07:37.122
¶ The magic in the music ¶

07:37.124 --> 07:39.891
¶ And make chairs grow
branches like a tree ¶

07:39.893 --> 07:42.227
¶ I'll help you
set your talent free ¶

07:42.229 --> 07:44.596
¶ So just prepare
to be stunned ¶

07:44.598 --> 07:47.966
¶ Oh, yes,
we'll have some fun ¶

07:47.968 --> 07:51.937
¶ And feel the magic
in the music ¶

07:51.939 --> 07:55.774
¶ We feel the magic
in the music ¶

07:55.776 --> 07:59.444
¶ You'll feel
the magic in the music ¶

07:59.446 --> 08:05.717
¶ The music ¶

08:07.988 --> 08:09.688
Now, before we begin,

08:09.690 --> 08:11.923
I need to make
a few adjustments.

08:11.925 --> 08:14.993
Since Vivian is clearly
the star of the group,

08:14.995 --> 08:18.129
we must place her
front and center.

08:18.131 --> 08:20.265
I didn't know
Vivian was the star.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.834
Of course I'm not.
We're all in the band together.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.870
I only meant that Vivian

08:24.872 --> 08:27.272
has the most
natural talent.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.641
If Vivian's up front,

08:29.643 --> 08:32.777
- how will we do our special
spin move together?
- It's our favorite part.

08:32.779 --> 08:36.481
But Princess Vivian
must have no distractions
from her solo.

08:36.483 --> 08:39.050
- I get a solo?
- But of course.

08:39.052 --> 08:41.887
Ooh, this looks
really tricky.

08:41.889 --> 08:44.122
Which is why we must
devote the rest of the class

08:44.124 --> 08:45.690
to practicing it.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.025
Now, give it a try.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.861
( playing tentatively )

08:53.534 --> 08:55.867
Baron Von Rocha,

08:55.869 --> 08:58.036
what are we
supposed to be doing?

08:58.038 --> 08:59.304
Oh.

08:59.306 --> 09:02.007
You're supposed to please
not distract Vivian

09:02.009 --> 09:05.310
while she's working on
a very important solo.

09:05.312 --> 09:07.646
Let's try it again
from the top.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.881
It seems like Von Rocha
only wants to teach Vivian.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.383
Yeah.

09:11.385 --> 09:12.984
I'm sure he'll
get to us soon.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.253
At least, I hope he does.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.088
Oh, boy, this is
really stuck.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.924
I'll never get it out.

09:19.927 --> 09:22.027
Sure, you will.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.528
Here you go.

09:23.530 --> 09:25.096
Oh, thanks.
Wait a minute.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.599
My amulet lets me
talk to animals.

09:27.601 --> 09:30.201
Oh. Well, to be honest,
I'm not much of a talker.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.770
I'm more of a singer.

09:31.772 --> 09:34.272
- You sing?
- I used to.

09:34.274 --> 09:38.009
I was once a true songbird
with the most gorgeous voice.

09:38.011 --> 09:41.513
But now... ( squawks )
It's gone.

09:41.515 --> 09:43.615
But the baron promised
he's working on a spell

09:43.617 --> 09:45.517
to get it back.

09:45.519 --> 09:47.752
And Piccolo,
stop your squawking,

09:47.754 --> 09:49.087
and give me a hand.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.256
Oh, the baron needs me.
I've got to go.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.759
We are done for today.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.028
But you lucky children
will enjoy

09:57.030 --> 10:00.131
lots more practice
time with me tomorrow.

10:01.702 --> 10:05.604
Oh, he means his favorite
student Vivian will.

10:08.742 --> 10:12.043
Baron Von Rocha,
can I talk to you for a minute?

10:12.045 --> 10:13.278
It's about my solo.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.946
I'm not sure I should do it.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.281
I think my friends
feel left out,

10:16.283 --> 10:17.949
and I don't want
to hurt their feelings.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.719
Princess Vivian,
you must stop worrying

10:20.721 --> 10:23.088
about the other members
of your band.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.256
They are only
holding you back.

10:25.258 --> 10:26.958
Just imagine this.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.994
At the next
band showdown,

10:28.996 --> 10:31.129
<i> when you play</i>
<i> the special solo</i>

10:31.131 --> 10:33.264
<i> I picked out</i>
<i> just for you.</i>

10:33.266 --> 10:37.102
<i>The entire audience will see</i>
<i> how talented you are.</i>

10:37.104 --> 10:39.938
<i> They will all</i>
<i> burst into applause,</i>

10:39.940 --> 10:41.740
<i> and it will be</i>
<i> just for you.</i>

10:41.742 --> 10:43.408
That would be incredible!

10:43.410 --> 10:45.276
But none of that
will happen

10:45.278 --> 10:47.979
unless you rise above
the others and master
that solo.

10:47.981 --> 10:51.416
- I will.
- Just remember,
you are the star!

10:51.418 --> 10:53.084
I am the star.

10:53.086 --> 10:56.021
All right.
Thank you, Baron Von Rocha.

10:57.024 --> 10:59.190
Ah, Piccolo,
making Princess Vivian

10:59.192 --> 11:01.259
the star of the band
will drive away

11:01.261 --> 11:03.595
her annoying
and talentless friends

11:03.597 --> 11:06.631
so she can focus on
learning that solo.

11:06.633 --> 11:09.034
And as soon as she
plays that solo,

11:09.036 --> 11:11.269
it will cast
a magic spell

11:11.271 --> 11:13.471
that gives me
all of her musical talent.

11:13.473 --> 11:14.806
( squawking )

11:14.808 --> 11:16.174
Yes, yes.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.210
Just like I borrowed
your songbird talents.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.179
( angry squawking )

11:21.181 --> 11:22.647
You know I had to do that.

11:22.649 --> 11:25.116
Taking your musical talent
gave my powers a boost.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.788
But now,
they're fading again.

11:29.790 --> 11:30.955
( groans )

11:30.957 --> 11:32.557
( squawks )

11:32.559 --> 11:35.393
Do not worry,
my blaring birdy.

11:35.395 --> 11:39.197
As soon as I have
Princess Vivian's
magical talent for my own,

11:39.199 --> 11:41.399
I shall return
your singing voice.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.234
( squawks )

11:44.638 --> 11:46.371
Quickly, students.
Everyone inside.

11:46.373 --> 11:49.140
Let us begin practicing
right away.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.746
It is time for
Vivian's solo.

11:54.748 --> 11:56.715
Okay. Here it goes.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.220
I wonder when
we get to play.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.521
I don't know.

12:03.523 --> 12:06.491
Oh, I messed it up again.

12:06.493 --> 12:09.227
Because you guys
were doing all that talking.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.261
We barely
made a peep.

12:10.263 --> 12:12.263
I really need
to concentrate.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.032
Of course you do.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.835
You are the star
of this band.

12:16.837 --> 12:19.037
That's right, I am.

12:19.039 --> 12:22.040
Perhaps we should all
take a short break

12:22.042 --> 12:25.076
so that Princess Vivian
can regain her focus, hm?

12:25.078 --> 12:27.112
Why is Vivian acting
so cranky?

12:27.114 --> 12:28.947
I don't know.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.216
But I do know something
that always cheers her up.

12:31.218 --> 12:34.619
Hey, Vivian,
wanna practice
our special move?

12:34.621 --> 12:36.454
I thought we could
add something fun
to the ending.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.089
Like this.

12:39.392 --> 12:40.692
Ooh, let me try.

12:42.729 --> 12:44.095
( giggling )

12:44.097 --> 12:47.065
Princess Vivian,
what are you doing?

12:47.067 --> 12:48.533
Our special spin.

12:48.535 --> 12:50.435
It's our favorite part
of being in the band.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.037
This is an unnecessary
distraction.

12:53.039 --> 12:55.240
You must pour
all of your attention

12:55.242 --> 12:57.275
into learning
your solo.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.144
Right, right.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.312
Sorry, Sofia, but could you
please leave me alone?

13:01.314 --> 13:04.582
- We're all done with
the spin forever.
- What?

13:04.584 --> 13:07.085
Can't you see this solo
is really hard?

13:07.087 --> 13:08.586
If I'm going to learn it
in time for

13:08.588 --> 13:10.121
the next band showdown,

13:10.123 --> 13:12.657
I don't have time to do
silly dance moves with you.

13:12.659 --> 13:14.826
To the back, please.

13:20.667 --> 13:24.269
Sofia? Ah, there you are.
Is everything all right?

13:24.271 --> 13:26.304
Not really, Mom.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.907
- Vivian and I
had a fight today.
- Oh.

13:28.909 --> 13:31.810
She started acting like
she was the star of our band.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.945
Like she didn't even need
the rest of us.

13:33.947 --> 13:36.414
I'm sorry, honey.
That must've hurt.

13:36.416 --> 13:39.083
I don't think I want to play
in the band with her anymore.

13:39.085 --> 13:42.153
That's the thing about
music and friends.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.355
You can choose to play alone,

13:44.357 --> 13:48.326
or you can play with others
and make an even more
beautiful sound.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.296
You and Vivian have been
friends for a long time,

13:51.298 --> 13:53.331
and friends
should stick together,
don't you think?

13:53.333 --> 13:56.167
Why don't you give her
one more chance?

13:56.169 --> 13:59.170
Okay, Mom. I will.
Thanks.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.339
Oh, good,
you're all here.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.274
I wanted to tell you
about a few changes

14:03.276 --> 14:05.210
the baron and I
wanted to make to the band.

14:05.212 --> 14:09.047
What did you do
to your uniform?

14:09.049 --> 14:10.682
The baron thought
it would be better

14:10.684 --> 14:12.817
if mine was bright red.
That way, I'd really stand out.

14:12.819 --> 14:15.854
You're already gonna play
in front of all of us.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.355
Won't that make you
stand out enough?

14:17.357 --> 14:19.557
Oh, that's one of the other
changes we made.

14:19.559 --> 14:22.794
Now you guys will be
way, way in the back

14:22.796 --> 14:24.662
over in that corner,

14:24.664 --> 14:26.865
so I definitely won't
get distracted during my solo.

14:26.867 --> 14:29.234
We'll barely have enough room
to play over there, Vivian.

14:29.236 --> 14:31.202
That's okay.
The baron says

14:31.204 --> 14:34.005
everyone will be
listening to me anyway.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.406
Oh, and one more thing.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.408
Please. No more things.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.310
Yeah. I've heard enough.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.879
If you think
you're so special,

14:40.881 --> 14:42.413
you can play
by yourself, Vivian.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.215
I'm quitting
the band.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.251
- Me, too.
- Me, three.

14:48.021 --> 14:49.220
And by the way,

14:49.222 --> 14:51.990
the uniforms
look nicer in yellow!

14:53.727 --> 14:56.728
I can't believe
the way they're all acting.

14:56.730 --> 14:59.731
Vivian, I can't believe
how you're acting.

14:59.733 --> 15:02.667
I'm just trying to do
what Baron Von Rocha says,

15:02.669 --> 15:05.036
and learn magical music
the best I can.

15:05.038 --> 15:08.706
But you're also being
really selfish and...

15:08.708 --> 15:10.375
and a terrible friend.

15:10.377 --> 15:12.277
You're quitting, too?

15:12.279 --> 15:14.946
Yes. Now that the band
has a big star,

15:14.948 --> 15:17.248
it just isn't fun anymore.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.850
Sofia, wait.

15:18.852 --> 15:22.253
Now, let us get started.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.689
Baron Von Rocha,
I have bad news.

15:24.691 --> 15:27.692
I'm so sorry, but everyone else
just quit the band.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.460
You do not need the band.

15:29.462 --> 15:32.263
Now we can practice
without distractions.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.265
I guess you're right.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.200
Then let us begin.

15:38.038 --> 15:41.072
Oh, Piccolo,
it's finally going to happen.

15:41.074 --> 15:44.409
She will at last
play the entire solo correctly,

15:44.411 --> 15:47.378
and the spell will give me
her talent.

15:47.380 --> 15:50.481
I'm really going to miss
playing with Vivian.

15:50.483 --> 15:53.584
I'm going to miss
wearing these fabulous uniforms.

15:53.586 --> 15:56.487
Come on, Sofia.
Let's go.

16:01.728 --> 16:05.430
That's it.
You're so very close
to finishing the solo.

16:05.432 --> 16:06.731
Just a few more notes.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.867
It's really tricky.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.241
I did it!

16:17.243 --> 16:19.143
I did it,
I finished the solo!

16:19.145 --> 16:22.013
You most certainly did.

16:22.015 --> 16:25.450
That's strange.
It didn't cast any magic spell.

16:25.452 --> 16:28.653
- Yes. How odd.
- ( squawks )

16:28.655 --> 16:30.855
Why don't you
play it again?

16:30.857 --> 16:33.291
( playing discordant notes )

16:33.293 --> 16:35.593
Oh, that sounded terrible.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.662
It's like I've forgotten
how to play.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.298
You are just tired,
dear princess.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.699
You must go and rest.

16:41.701 --> 16:44.102
Okay. Right. Rest.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.304
Rest up. Good-bye.
Bye-bye.

16:46.306 --> 16:47.772
I've done it, Piccolo!
Her talent is gone,

16:47.774 --> 16:50.775
and that means
it is now mine!

16:57.684 --> 16:59.884
( squawking )

16:59.886 --> 17:01.786
You can stop
your screeching, Piccolo.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.955
I know what you want.

17:03.957 --> 17:05.556
You want me to return
your songbird voice.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.992
- Isn't that right?
- ( squawks happily )

17:07.994 --> 17:10.161
Well, as it turns out,

17:10.163 --> 17:12.196
I did write a piece of
magical music

17:12.198 --> 17:14.298
that will give you back
the talent I borrowed.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.801
But then, why should I?

17:16.803 --> 17:18.069
( angry squawk )

17:18.071 --> 17:19.837
I have changed my mind.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.373
I shall keep the talent
I stole from Vivian

17:22.375 --> 17:25.476
and from you,
my dear Piccolo.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.078
( angry screeching )

17:33.920 --> 17:36.054
Princess Sofia,
I need your help.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.989
Baron Von Rocha
cast a spell

17:37.991 --> 17:39.991
that took away
Vivian's musical talent.

17:39.993 --> 17:41.426
Come see.

17:41.428 --> 17:44.929
( playing discordant notes )

17:44.931 --> 17:47.398
( sobbing )
What is wrong with me?

17:47.400 --> 17:49.500
Why would Von Rocha
do something so awful?

17:49.502 --> 17:51.502
He wanted her talent
for himself.

17:51.504 --> 17:54.005
He uses magic to steal it.

17:54.007 --> 17:55.540
What?

17:55.542 --> 17:57.442
He did it to Vivian.
He did it to me

17:57.444 --> 17:59.510
when he took my songbird voice,
and he's done it to many others.

17:59.512 --> 18:00.845
Each time his powers
start to fade,

18:00.847 --> 18:02.613
he has to do it
all over again.

18:02.615 --> 18:05.450
There must be a way
to get Vivian back
her talent.

18:05.452 --> 18:08.019
There is.
This spell.

18:08.021 --> 18:09.854
If you play this
in front of Von Rocha,

18:09.856 --> 18:13.091
it will give back
all the musical talent
he's ever stolen.

18:13.093 --> 18:15.059
I've got to go play it
right away.

18:15.061 --> 18:18.096
Von Rocha is too powerful
for you to face alone.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.597
But I have to do something.

18:19.599 --> 18:24.135
Then let me tell you
the secret of magical music.

18:24.137 --> 18:27.138
If you play together,
as a group,

18:27.140 --> 18:29.474
the magic is
far more powerful

18:29.476 --> 18:32.110
than any one person
playing alone.

18:32.112 --> 18:33.678
I'll get the band.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.615
Vivian is heartbroken
and we have to help her.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.816
I don't know, Sofia.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.718
After the way
she treated us.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.087
Von Rocha was using her
the whole time.

18:43.089 --> 18:44.655
He made her
act that way.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.324
That may be true,

18:46.326 --> 18:48.292
but is it really
our job to fix this?

18:48.294 --> 18:50.094
Of course it is.

18:50.096 --> 18:52.430
She's our friend,
and she needs us.

18:52.432 --> 18:53.664
We've got to
stick together.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.933
You know what?
Sofia's right.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.802
Okay. Let's go.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.070
Ugh. Okay.

18:59.072 --> 19:00.471
( sobbing )

19:00.473 --> 19:02.073
Vivian, come with us.

19:02.075 --> 19:04.242
Where are you all going?

19:04.244 --> 19:06.377
We'll explain on the way.
Come on.

19:09.682 --> 19:12.416
We know what you did
to Vivian, Baron Von Rocha.

19:12.418 --> 19:14.485
You took away
my talent.

19:14.487 --> 19:15.486
And we're gonna
take it back.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.555
Come on, guys.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.494
Ah, I see what you are
trying to do,

19:23.496 --> 19:26.764
you traitorous bird,
but it won't work.

19:26.766 --> 19:30.168
These amateurs are no match
for a musical genius

19:30.170 --> 19:31.536
such as myself.

19:36.709 --> 19:39.510
SOFIA: Everyone start playing.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.412
Just follow the musical spell.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.656
I heard an awful commotion
in here.

19:51.658 --> 19:53.157
What's going on?

19:53.159 --> 19:55.526
Baron Von Rocha,
he cast a spell.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.628
He stole my musical talent.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.298
Baron Von Rocha,
you won't get away

20:00.300 --> 20:02.600
with such a despicable act.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.405
Miss Merriwether,
help us.

20:07.407 --> 20:09.173
If we can get through
this magical tune,

20:09.175 --> 20:10.741
we'll get
Vivian's talent back.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.643
Say no more.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.770
Keep playing.

20:39.772 --> 20:42.006
We've almost finished
the piece.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.515
No!

20:54.887 --> 20:56.754
What's happening

20:56.756 --> 20:59.390
All of the talent he stole
is going back where it belongs.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.859
( playing melodic tune )

21:01.861 --> 21:02.893
Yes!

21:02.895 --> 21:06.264
( singing beautifully )

21:08.201 --> 21:10.201
No, no, no.

21:10.203 --> 21:12.770
The great Von Rocha
is no longer great.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.072
All my talent is gone.

21:15.074 --> 21:17.375
And I'm going to make sure

21:17.377 --> 21:19.477
it stays that way
forever.

21:19.479 --> 21:23.381
Your musical thievery
is over, baron!

21:23.383 --> 21:25.383
That is what you think.

21:25.385 --> 21:26.951
You haven't heard the last--

21:26.953 --> 21:29.020
I think we have, buster.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.223
You musical menace!

21:32.225 --> 21:35.726
( screaming indistinctly )

21:35.728 --> 21:39.196
You have not seen
the last of Von Rocha!

21:42.468 --> 21:44.402
I'm sorry.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.837
I wish I could take back
all those terrible things
I said.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.839
We're just glad
you got your talent back.

21:48.841 --> 21:53.344
And just in time for
tomorrow's band showdown.

21:53.346 --> 21:54.912
Oh, right.

21:54.914 --> 21:57.948
Uh, that is, if we're
still in the band together.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.784
That depends.

21:59.786 --> 22:01.118
Is it going to be
how we were before?

22:01.120 --> 22:04.422
Yes. All of us together
as a team.

22:04.424 --> 22:05.489
What do you say, guys?

22:05.491 --> 22:08.292
I have just one thing to say.

22:08.294 --> 22:10.428
We're the band
that sticks together.

22:10.430 --> 22:13.331
Royal Prep's
the best band ever!
