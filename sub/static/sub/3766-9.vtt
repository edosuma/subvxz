11:32.952 --> 11:34.455
How did you and Dad do it?

11:35.189 --> 11:37.193
Communication
and compromise,

11:37.795 --> 11:40.266
the keys to many things,

11:40.299 --> 11:42.604
but definitely my recipe
for a magical,

11:42.637 --> 11:44.675
loving and happy marriage.

11:53.794 --> 11:55.964
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

11:57.567 --> 11:59.806
-Abigail?
-Hi!

12:01.308 --> 12:02.477
Where's mom?

12:02.511 --> 12:03.546
She had to run out.

12:03.579 --> 12:04.882
I told her I'd watch
the store.

12:06.118 --> 12:08.122
-Where?
-Ryan picked her up.

12:08.924 --> 12:09.992
Ryan?

12:11.863 --> 12:13.599
Again?

12:13.633 --> 12:15.738
I'm sure Cassie won't
be gone all the time.

12:17.240 --> 12:18.342
What do you mean?

12:19.310 --> 12:20.613
Well, you know,
what happens

12:20.647 --> 12:22.785
when your girlfriends
get boyfriends...

12:24.989 --> 12:27.160
They kind of disappear.

12:27.594 --> 12:28.596
Exactly.

12:36.178 --> 12:38.215
NICK: (LAUGHS) Yeah.
LINDA: (LAUGHING)
Thank you.

12:41.823 --> 12:43.225
-Hey.
-Hi.

12:43.258 --> 12:46.765
-Hey. Uh, can I tell him?
-Yes.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.170
-Tell me what?
-We're going to Hong Kong!

12:50.106 --> 12:51.174
Really?

12:56.953 --> 12:58.890
She's taking me
on her business trip.

12:58.924 --> 13:00.861
A whole month.

13:00.894 --> 13:02.196
We leave at the
end of the week.

13:02.230 --> 13:05.036
-Isn't that great?
-No.

13:05.069 --> 13:07.741
What? Come on, Dad.
Why not?

13:07.774 --> 13:09.711
Well, off the top
of my head,

13:09.745 --> 13:11.448
you're in school.

13:11.481 --> 13:13.552
Hong Kong is halfway
around the world.

13:14.420 --> 13:15.623
You don't speak Chinese.

13:15.657 --> 13:17.426
It's just a month,

13:17.460 --> 13:20.968
we can Skype every day
and I can learn Chinese.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.303
And school?

13:22.336 --> 13:26.846
Sam, traveling to Hong Kong
is an educational experience.

13:26.880 --> 13:28.917
How about the fact
that nobody discussed
this with me?

13:29.785 --> 13:31.288
We wanted
to surprise you.

13:31.722 --> 13:32.892
(LAUGHS)

13:34.996 --> 13:37.868
Nick, I need to
talk to your mother

13:37.902 --> 13:39.170
for a second, alone.

13:40.673 --> 13:42.711
-Don't let him
change your mind.
-Never.

13:42.744 --> 13:44.715
SAM: Just wait
in the car, okay?

13:49.557 --> 13:50.827
Nick's doing well.

13:51.494 --> 13:52.596
We both like it here.

13:52.630 --> 13:53.967
He doesn't need
to go with you.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.906
No, you like it here.
He doesn't.

13:56.940 --> 13:58.844
This isn't happening.

13:58.877 --> 14:00.379
I have full custody of him.

14:00.412 --> 14:01.850
You can't take him
to Hong Kong

14:01.883 --> 14:05.222
or New York or Blairsville
without my written permission.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.295
All right.

14:08.328 --> 14:09.999
Then he is only going
to resent you

14:10.032 --> 14:11.501
more than he
already does.

14:29.537 --> 14:31.809
-Tara!
-Hey!

14:32.276 --> 14:33.578
Hey.

14:35.016 --> 14:36.084
(SCOFFS)

14:36.118 --> 14:37.686
-Think it's...
-Oh...

14:37.720 --> 14:39.590
-Oh!
-Oh! Sorry.

14:40.692 --> 14:42.463
Sorry. Let's try that again.

14:48.775 --> 14:50.046
It's so good to see you.

14:50.079 --> 14:51.681
Yeah. It's so
good to be back.

14:57.560 --> 14:58.662
MARTHA: $4.50?

14:59.464 --> 15:00.732
I don't understand.

15:00.766 --> 15:02.703
It's your check
from yesterday.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.374
But you said
that was on the house.

15:04.407 --> 15:05.809
Well, that was
before I found out

15:05.843 --> 15:07.546
that you were trying
to run my "house"

15:07.580 --> 15:08.648
out of business.

15:09.150 --> 15:10.186
Ah...

15:11.421 --> 15:14.627
Well, you know,
I really am very busy...

15:14.660 --> 15:17.266
Yes, what with bringing
in a major franchise

15:17.300 --> 15:19.104
which will probably
put me out of business,

15:19.137 --> 15:20.873
I'm sure your day
is jam-packed.

15:20.907 --> 15:22.410
Don't you think
you're overreacting?

15:22.443 --> 15:23.879
The fact that you
didn't tell me

15:23.913 --> 15:25.482
says that my reaction
is spot on.

15:25.516 --> 15:27.820
It is a testament
to the strength
of your business

15:27.853 --> 15:29.624
and your
managerial panache

15:29.657 --> 15:32.563
that I think you
can handle a small
franchise coming to town.

15:32.596 --> 15:34.067
Two hundred stores!

15:34.100 --> 15:37.473
This is the kind of
business that makes
a town look like a city.

15:37.506 --> 15:39.877
Java Shed will
attract other franchises,

15:39.911 --> 15:41.581
maybe even
a big box store.

15:41.614 --> 15:43.485
I want that
big box store.

15:43.518 --> 15:46.091
You swore to support
and uphold the welfare

15:46.124 --> 15:47.826
of all citizens of Middleton,

15:47.860 --> 15:49.897
and to faithfully
discharge the duties

15:49.931 --> 15:51.768
you were appointed
to execute

15:51.801 --> 15:55.109
in a manner befitting
the office of Mayor.

15:55.142 --> 15:57.346
You are using
my oath of office
against me.

15:57.380 --> 15:58.848
That is dirty pool.

15:58.882 --> 16:00.586
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

16:00.619 --> 16:02.723
But it's like kryptonite.

16:02.756 --> 16:04.460
That's because you
still have a soul.

16:04.494 --> 16:06.098
But no coffee franchise.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.400
You can't have both.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.572
Fine. I'll tell
Java Shed no

16:10.606 --> 16:12.910
and give them a map
to Blairsville.

16:12.943 --> 16:14.880
Doesn't it feel good
to do the right thing?

16:16.051 --> 16:17.186
Yes.

16:21.661 --> 16:23.098
(CASSIE SIGHING)

16:25.836 --> 16:27.140
-(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
-Hey, Sam.

16:27.173 --> 16:28.742
-Hey, you got
a second?
-Sure.

16:32.516 --> 16:34.454
She wants to take him
to Hong Kong.

16:37.426 --> 16:39.230
She didn't say
a word to me.

16:39.264 --> 16:42.036
She conspired with Nick
and now I have to say no

16:42.070 --> 16:44.407
and then I look like
the bad guy again.

16:45.309 --> 16:47.846
Looking like
the bad guy fades.

16:47.880 --> 16:49.417
What's important
is you're not a bad guy.

16:49.450 --> 16:51.154
Nick will figure that out.

16:51.188 --> 16:52.690
And you have full custody.

16:52.723 --> 16:54.694
Oh, I can fight her, but...

16:55.362 --> 16:57.133
But you're
protecting Nick.

16:57.166 --> 16:59.970
He doesn't know that Linda
never fought me for him.

17:00.004 --> 17:02.710
I wanted full custody
and I would've gone
to the mat with her,

17:02.743 --> 17:05.249
but she wanted
the job in London more.

17:05.282 --> 17:07.018
It would kill him to find
out that his mother

17:07.052 --> 17:08.688
basically just walked away.

17:10.326 --> 17:11.561
I can't allow that.

17:12.663 --> 17:14.534
And if I end up
in court with Linda,

17:14.567 --> 17:16.204
my lawyer will
use that against her

17:16.238 --> 17:17.973
and I'll win the battle
and lose the war.

17:19.510 --> 17:20.712
Hmm.

17:20.746 --> 17:23.718
I think I just have
to weather the storm, and...

17:23.752 --> 17:25.456
...she's going to do
what she always does,

17:25.489 --> 17:28.228
blow through
and leave a big mess
for me to clean up.

17:29.164 --> 17:30.799
-Is that right?
-No.

17:31.568 --> 17:32.703
It's not right.

17:34.038 --> 17:36.009
It's just Linda. (SNICKERS)

17:45.862 --> 17:47.966
I found this
on our nightstand.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.637
I was looking through it
the other day.

17:53.144 --> 17:55.816
-Oh, my hair
is so long!
-Oh!

17:56.751 --> 17:58.488
I like it better short.

17:58.522 --> 18:00.024
Police regulations.

18:03.097 --> 18:05.067
First vacation,
remember?

18:05.101 --> 18:06.871
I forgot to put
on sunscreen.

18:06.904 --> 18:08.475
-(LAUGHING)
-Lobster woman.

TARA: Oh...

18:13.151 --> 18:14.787
This wasn't even
that long ago...

18:16.157 --> 18:17.593
It feels like forever.

18:21.534 --> 18:22.603
I miss you.

18:25.909 --> 18:27.946
Yeah, I miss you too.

18:28.882 --> 18:30.386
(STUTTERS)

18:32.690 --> 18:33.792
It's weird, isn't it?

18:33.825 --> 18:35.629
-Yeah. It is.
-Why? Why is that?

18:36.864 --> 18:39.270
I haven't been here
in a long time.

18:39.304 --> 18:40.972
I'm sorry I haven't
been able to get away.

18:43.412 --> 18:44.847
Well, we're together now.

18:46.651 --> 18:47.986
Right.

18:58.375 --> 19:00.077
I hate to bring
this up.

19:00.110 --> 19:01.112
What?

19:02.783 --> 19:04.354
I'm sensing something.

19:05.856 --> 19:08.628
Which is kind of odd,
considering that's your thing.

19:08.662 --> 19:11.200
Ever since the storm,
it's like you're there

19:11.233 --> 19:13.136
but you're not there.

19:15.107 --> 19:16.109
I'm all here.

19:18.181 --> 19:19.216
Okay.

19:19.817 --> 19:21.253
Um, I was thinking that

19:21.287 --> 19:24.025
you might want
to come over for
dinner tomorrow night.

19:24.058 --> 19:26.398
I can't. My parents
are coming to town.

19:26.431 --> 19:28.133
Oh. Well, next time.

19:28.166 --> 19:29.704
Yeah.

19:29.737 --> 19:31.541
Well, why don't you
just come with us.
You and Grace.

19:31.574 --> 19:33.043
No, we wouldn't
want to intrude.

19:33.076 --> 19:34.714
You can't intrude,
because I'm inviting you.

19:35.849 --> 19:36.884
Come on,
it'll be fun.

19:36.918 --> 19:38.020
Or at least as much fun

19:38.053 --> 19:39.524
as dinner with
my parents can be.

19:40.124 --> 19:41.694
-Okay.
-Good.

19:44.900 --> 19:46.904
Hey, Grace, wait up!

19:47.840 --> 19:49.075
-Hey!
-Hey.

19:50.512 --> 19:52.382
How are you?

19:52.416 --> 19:55.989
Uh, wow! (LAUGHS)

19:56.022 --> 19:58.060
Sorry, I've never
really seen you

19:58.093 --> 19:59.329
like this before.

20:00.030 --> 20:01.066
Happy!

20:01.099 --> 20:02.134
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

20:02.168 --> 20:04.339
Yeah, I guess maybe
you haven't.

20:05.308 --> 20:06.478
Well, I like it.

20:08.748 --> 20:10.752
You missed
your mom.

20:10.786 --> 20:13.658
Uh, yeah, but we're going
to Hong Kong together.

20:14.259 --> 20:15.395
-Really?
-Yeah!

20:15.428 --> 20:16.531
Wow.

20:17.232 --> 20:18.802
Your dad's
cool with it?

20:18.835 --> 20:21.440
No, but I should get a say.

20:22.108 --> 20:23.210
Right.

20:25.281 --> 20:26.984
Is your mom married?

20:27.018 --> 20:29.256
No, but her
boyfriend Geoffrey

20:29.289 --> 20:31.260
tries to act like my stepdad.

20:31.293 --> 20:33.898
-Geoffrey?
-He lives with her.

20:33.932 --> 20:36.237
-Is that weird for you?
-Honestly...

20:37.239 --> 20:38.241
Yeah.

20:39.243 --> 20:40.445
But you get used to it.

20:41.347 --> 20:42.916
Why'd you ask?

20:42.950 --> 20:44.754
-(SIGHING)
-Something going on
with your mom?

20:45.956 --> 20:48.193
I don't know.

20:48.226 --> 20:50.666
I just don't want
things to change
between me and my mom.

20:53.070 --> 20:54.439
Please,

20:54.473 --> 20:56.410
don't tell anybody
that I just said that.

20:57.412 --> 20:58.848
Who am I going to tell?

21:00.619 --> 21:02.088
Good point.

21:03.625 --> 21:04.760
Thanks.

21:16.718 --> 21:19.690
-Mmm! Smells wonderful.
-Yeah.

21:19.724 --> 21:22.596
Thanks. It still has
to simmer for a while.

21:22.630 --> 21:24.667
-Yeah, let it blend.
-Yeah.

21:26.704 --> 21:28.341
So, Ryan's parents
are in town

21:28.374 --> 21:30.177
and, well,
we thought maybe

21:30.210 --> 21:31.547
we could all go have
dinner tomorrow night.

21:33.317 --> 21:35.521
Oh. You know what,
I have a test.

21:38.093 --> 21:39.730
You don't have a test.

21:39.764 --> 21:40.932
But you can skip dinner.

21:43.070 --> 21:44.172
Thanks, Mom.

21:53.424 --> 21:55.862
-Grace.
-Yeah?

21:55.896 --> 21:56.964
Hey.

21:57.833 --> 21:59.035
I carried you
for nine months.

21:59.904 --> 22:02.141
It took 20 hours
of hard labor

22:02.174 --> 22:03.712
to give birth to you.

22:04.880 --> 22:06.182
I have been there for you
and with you

22:06.216 --> 22:07.986
since the day you
opened your eyes.

22:09.623 --> 22:11.961
I'm here, honey.
I'm not going anywhere.

22:15.134 --> 22:17.472
-Okay.
-Okay.

22:22.349 --> 22:23.584
Jones can't be serious.

22:23.617 --> 22:25.555
My father's always serious.

22:25.588 --> 22:27.191
He's wanted this property
for a long time.

22:27.224 --> 22:30.097
It just came
on the market, so he
swooped in and bought it.

22:30.130 --> 22:31.700
This is not good.

22:31.734 --> 22:34.105
Dad wants you on point
for this project.

22:34.138 --> 22:35.742
You have the inside track.

22:35.776 --> 22:37.712
He already has
a franchisee that
wants to renovate

22:37.746 --> 22:40.084
and sign a five-year
lease for double the rent.

22:40.786 --> 22:42.221
Okay, I gotta
talk to him.

22:42.254 --> 22:43.624
He doesn't
want to talk,

22:43.657 --> 22:45.461
he wants you to
smooth things over
with the tenant,

22:45.495 --> 22:47.966
get them out of the building
press and drama-free.

22:50.438 --> 22:52.208
He says you know
the current tenant.

22:52.241 --> 22:53.644
-Yeah.
-That's good.

22:54.379 --> 22:55.581
No. It's not good.

22:58.286 --> 22:59.756
I'm sure you'll figure
something out.

23:06.336 --> 23:08.774
-Cassie!
-Tara!

23:08.808 --> 23:11.046
-Hi.
-Hi. Good to see you!

23:11.079 --> 23:13.484
-Good to see you too.
-Where's Brandon?

23:13.517 --> 23:15.889
-Uh, he went into work.
-Oh.

23:18.260 --> 23:19.997
Cassie, I, um...

23:23.637 --> 23:25.408
You have a secret.

23:26.978 --> 23:28.280
I do.

23:29.315 --> 23:30.818
One you haven't shared.

23:30.852 --> 23:32.054
(SIGHS)

23:32.088 --> 23:33.390
I don't know how.

23:33.958 --> 23:35.661
I'm... I'm afraid.

23:37.231 --> 23:39.970
You face your fear,
stand up to it

23:40.004 --> 23:41.406
and you take
its power away.

23:53.230 --> 23:54.398
What is it?

24:03.884 --> 24:06.457
Well, your landlord definitely
sold the building.

24:08.494 --> 24:09.729
Can you go see him?

24:09.763 --> 24:12.001
He moved to Arizona
a few years ago.

24:12.034 --> 24:15.074
Oh. You know, Cassie,
this is more Ryan's thing.

24:15.107 --> 24:16.309
He's in meetings all day.

24:16.342 --> 24:17.812
I haven't been able
to reach him.

24:17.845 --> 24:19.616
But your old lease
will protect you.

24:19.649 --> 24:22.088
The new owner
has to honor the terms
under your old landlord.

24:22.121 --> 24:23.423
My original lease expired.

24:24.092 --> 24:25.160
(SIGHS)

24:25.194 --> 24:26.429
So you're on
a month-to-month.

24:26.462 --> 24:27.865
Yeah.

24:27.899 --> 24:29.569
And no guarantees
from your old landlord?

24:29.603 --> 24:33.644
A handshake and his word
that I could stay there
as long as I wanted.

24:33.677 --> 24:35.147
And you can't take
a handshake to court.

24:36.082 --> 24:37.218
Never thought I'd have to.

24:38.487 --> 24:40.558
Well, that doesn't leave
you many options.

24:40.591 --> 24:42.228
You either have to pay
the increase in rent

24:42.261 --> 24:44.733
or the new owner can give
you notice to move out.

24:49.375 --> 24:52.248
-You're quitting?
-Resigning.

24:52.281 --> 24:53.784
That's my two weeks' notice.

24:54.152 --> 24:55.387
Why?

24:55.420 --> 24:58.794
Relocating to be with
my wife in San Francisco.

24:59.763 --> 25:00.865
And she can't
relocate here?

25:01.900 --> 25:04.004
Her path was made up
a long time ago.

25:05.541 --> 25:07.144
Mine is new.

25:07.178 --> 25:08.647
One of us has
to give, or...

25:09.649 --> 25:10.785
...our flame will go out.

25:12.321 --> 25:13.591
You okay?

25:13.624 --> 25:15.227
Yeah.

25:15.260 --> 25:17.599
It's just something
Cassie said.

25:20.070 --> 25:22.775
So Cassie's okay with
you leaving Middleton?

25:22.809 --> 25:25.514
Well, she's okay with me
saving my marriage.

25:29.422 --> 25:32.629
-What is it?
-You know, I...

25:32.662 --> 25:35.901
...was kind of grooming you
to be my lieutenant.

25:35.935 --> 25:38.440
-Yeah?
-Yeah, you know,
I was your dad's

25:38.473 --> 25:40.978
and thought it was
only right that,

25:41.011 --> 25:43.216
you know, someday
you'd be mine.

25:44.886 --> 25:48.627
But there's guys here
with more time in
and seniority than me.

25:48.661 --> 25:51.700
Cassie and your father

25:51.733 --> 25:54.472
taught me that when
it comes to people,

25:54.505 --> 25:56.108
you have to learn
to trust your instincts.

25:58.681 --> 26:00.049
You were the guy.

26:03.323 --> 26:04.626
Sorry.

26:06.963 --> 26:08.466
-Hi.
-Hi.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.237
-Can I borrow some tea?
-Of course!

26:10.270 --> 26:12.274
Sam is more of
a coffee drinker.

26:12.308 --> 26:13.944
-I know.
-Oh, you do?

26:13.977 --> 26:16.182
Well, he's not big
into tea. (CHUCKLES)

26:16.216 --> 26:19.222
He seems to be adjusting
to his surroundings, though.

26:19.255 --> 26:21.727
I guess you've heard
about my plans.

26:21.760 --> 26:23.230
Taking Nick
to Hong Kong?

26:23.263 --> 26:26.603
You must see
what a marvelous
opportunity this is.

26:26.637 --> 26:27.805
Excuse me?

26:27.839 --> 26:30.344
You've seen the benefits
of an unorthodox education.

26:30.377 --> 26:32.615
You traveled,
you moved around,

26:32.649 --> 26:34.819
it helped you,
shaped you,

26:34.853 --> 26:36.757
made you who you are.

26:36.790 --> 26:39.061
Well, all of our
experiences, good or bad,

26:39.094 --> 26:40.364
make us who we are.

26:40.765 --> 26:41.900
Exactly.

26:41.933 --> 26:43.704
And that's what
I'm fighting for.

26:43.737 --> 26:46.141
To give him more
experiences in life.

26:46.175 --> 26:47.411
Like the scroll says.

26:48.246 --> 26:49.348
The scroll?

26:49.382 --> 26:53.456
"Who wishes to fight
must first count the cost."

26:53.490 --> 26:55.226
I can't shy away
from battles

26:55.260 --> 26:56.997
and I can't let Sam win.

26:57.030 --> 26:59.034
-You helped me see that.
-I didn't.

26:59.067 --> 27:02.508
Oh, you did. Thank you.

27:02.541 --> 27:06.516
I only wish that Sam
could see things
as clearly as you do.

27:11.927 --> 27:13.396
(SIGHING)

27:15.968 --> 27:18.272
So, I hear you're
going for dinner

27:18.306 --> 27:19.342
with Ryan and Cassie.

27:20.310 --> 27:22.682
I've... No, I'm not.

27:24.585 --> 27:25.721
I get it.

27:26.723 --> 27:28.125
What do you get?

27:28.159 --> 27:30.698
As your mom starts
to go out more,

27:30.731 --> 27:32.233
you start to feel like
a third wheel.

27:34.338 --> 27:35.574
(SIGHING)

27:35.607 --> 27:36.877
But I'm here, okay?

27:41.753 --> 27:44.291
Ooh! Maxima and minima.

27:44.893 --> 27:46.061
You know calculus?

27:47.030 --> 27:48.366
I know a lot of things.

27:52.040 --> 27:53.510
Y equals 13.

28:02.528 --> 28:03.630
What are you up to?

28:09.408 --> 28:10.711
What do you mean?

28:12.047 --> 28:13.082
Grace.

28:14.351 --> 28:15.921
I'm helping her,

28:15.955 --> 28:17.959
and I'm not doing anything
that you wouldn't do.

28:17.992 --> 28:20.296
I find that
hard to believe.

28:20.329 --> 28:22.100
You have always found it
hard to trust me.

28:23.904 --> 28:25.039
Everything is
gonna work out

28:26.308 --> 28:27.478
just the way
it's supposed to.

28:38.299 --> 28:41.238
Sam, you are
only putting off
the inevitable.

28:41.271 --> 28:43.109
Soon he'll be able
to choose who
he wants to be with,

28:43.142 --> 28:45.446
and with every decision
like this that you make,

28:45.480 --> 28:47.618
you are only pushing
him closer to me.

28:47.651 --> 28:50.891
(SIGHS) Linda,
we were married,
we had a son,

28:50.925 --> 28:52.327
it wasn't all bad.

28:53.262 --> 28:56.168
Don't do this to Nick.

28:56.201 --> 28:58.706
Cassie thinks
that Hong Kong
is a great idea.

28:58.741 --> 29:00.878
Cassie thinks Nick should
go to Hong Kong?

29:01.311 --> 29:02.380
Dad...

29:05.186 --> 29:06.321
Come on.

29:10.865 --> 29:12.267
You seem nervous, Ryan.

29:13.369 --> 29:14.672
I wonder why that is.

29:14.705 --> 29:16.275
I'm sure she'll be
here any minute.

29:16.308 --> 29:17.744
I'm not so sure.

29:17.779 --> 29:18.781
Excuse me?

29:19.783 --> 29:22.453
This is Abigail,
Cassie's cousin.

29:22.487 --> 29:24.993
-Pleasure to meet you both.
-Pleasure, Abigail.

29:25.026 --> 29:26.328
Enjoy your meal.

29:26.361 --> 29:27.363
Yeah.

29:30.469 --> 29:31.973
So...

29:32.007 --> 29:33.610
...you have
a big announcement?

29:34.544 --> 29:35.546
No.

29:36.248 --> 29:37.618
You seem nervous.

29:38.787 --> 29:40.223
No, I'm not.

29:40.256 --> 29:41.425
No announcement?

29:41.893 --> 29:43.362
No, Dad.

29:43.395 --> 29:45.066
So why are we here?

29:45.099 --> 29:47.370
Uh, to have dinner
with your son.

29:47.403 --> 29:49.742
Well, on the phone you
seemed kind of excited

29:49.775 --> 29:51.578
and, well,
I guess I thought

29:51.612 --> 29:54.017
you had some
big news to share.

29:54.785 --> 29:56.857
Uh... No. Just dinner.

29:58.192 --> 30:00.396
Told you. Told her.

30:06.041 --> 30:07.177
Oh, um...

30:07.210 --> 30:08.746
Can we talk later?
I'm running late.

30:09.949 --> 30:11.085
Did you tell Linda

30:11.118 --> 30:12.654
that you thought
taking Nick to Hong Kong

30:12.688 --> 30:14.057
was a great idea?

30:14.091 --> 30:16.796
-Sam...
-Did you encourage
her to fight me on this?

30:16.830 --> 30:18.700
-No.
-She says you did.

30:18.733 --> 30:19.735
Consider the source.

30:21.005 --> 30:22.473
I know. I know!

30:22.507 --> 30:23.542
This is what
she does to me.

30:23.575 --> 30:25.213
She turns me inside out,
makes me question

30:25.246 --> 30:26.415
all common sense!

30:31.125 --> 30:32.627
You look great, by the way.

30:35.599 --> 30:36.702
I'm interrupting.

30:37.570 --> 30:40.443
I'm meeting Ryan
and his parents.

30:40.476 --> 30:43.015
(SNICKERS) Oh.
I should go.

30:43.049 --> 30:46.255
No, you should
calm down before you
go back over there.

30:46.288 --> 30:49.127
-I'm okay.
-No, you're not. Tea?

30:49.762 --> 30:51.131
Your date?

30:51.165 --> 30:53.302
It's not a date like that.

30:53.335 --> 30:56.977
-I can't do this to you.
-Well, you're not doing
it, I am. Sit.

30:57.010 --> 30:58.245
Ryan will understand.

31:03.222 --> 31:04.858
Linda is a master

31:04.893 --> 31:07.363
of twisting things
to fit her agenda.

31:07.397 --> 31:09.134
She's winning
this fight.

31:09.167 --> 31:10.837
Well, that's because
you're playing her game.

31:12.373 --> 31:13.675
She strikes me
as a person who

31:13.709 --> 31:16.048
always has a reason
for everything she does.

31:16.917 --> 31:18.285
Find out the reason

31:18.319 --> 31:20.925
and you may find
a solution to your problem.

31:25.099 --> 31:27.503
She's normally
so punctual.

31:27.537 --> 31:30.844
-Could be traffic.
-Well...

31:30.877 --> 31:33.049
I guess I do have
some big news.

31:33.082 --> 31:34.885
I told you.
I told him.

31:34.919 --> 31:36.121
Apparently, she told me.

31:37.490 --> 31:39.661
-We want to help.
-We do.

31:39.694 --> 31:41.698
-Help?
-With the costs.

31:41.731 --> 31:43.635
I just want to be involved.

31:43.669 --> 31:45.439
It'll mean a lot
to your mother.

31:45.473 --> 31:47.912
To help me find
an executive
rental in Chicago?

31:47.945 --> 31:49.547
Is that where the
wedding's going to be?

31:49.581 --> 31:51.518
-What wedding?
-Yours.

31:51.551 --> 31:54.457
(LAUGHING) Oh, right!

31:54.491 --> 31:56.295
Oh, that's
a good one, Mom.

31:57.530 --> 31:59.667
Uh... You're not laughing.

32:01.505 --> 32:03.175
Who am I marrying?

32:03.842 --> 32:05.379
Cassie.

32:05.413 --> 32:07.483
Why would you think that?

32:07.517 --> 32:08.886
Well, you've known
her for so long

32:09.821 --> 32:11.691
and you talk about her
all the time.

32:12.260 --> 32:13.395
Yeah...

32:13.429 --> 32:15.333
Listen, my only
big news is that

32:15.366 --> 32:18.139
I got a really great
job offer in Chicago.

32:18.172 --> 32:20.609
It's a really great
opportunity, this job.

32:21.545 --> 32:23.282
Oh, sure...
(CHUCKLES)

32:23.315 --> 32:24.617
That's great, Ryan.

32:25.819 --> 32:26.990
Congratulations.

32:27.023 --> 32:29.161
-Yeah, congratulations.
-Thanks.

32:30.363 --> 32:32.500
(GLASSES CLINKING)

32:36.475 --> 32:37.944
(TEA POURING)

32:42.920 --> 32:44.257
What's up?

32:45.159 --> 32:46.495
We need to talk.

32:49.201 --> 32:50.403
Yeah.

32:52.440 --> 32:53.742
I'm so afraid.

32:54.444 --> 32:55.779
What are you afraid of?

32:56.648 --> 32:57.650
Your reaction.

33:01.191 --> 33:03.562
This is about us
living so far apart?

33:04.297 --> 33:05.433
Yeah.

33:06.301 --> 33:07.570
So I quit my job.

33:07.603 --> 33:09.407
I can be a police
officer anywhere.

33:10.343 --> 33:11.411
But England?

33:12.613 --> 33:14.784
Why would I want
to be in England?

33:14.817 --> 33:16.788
That's where
I'm going to be
the next three years.

33:18.259 --> 33:21.231
I got accepted
to Cambridge
for my doctorate.

33:21.265 --> 33:23.469
-Cambridge?
-Yeah.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.473
-In England.
-Yeah.

33:28.879 --> 33:30.783
Congratulations...

33:30.816 --> 33:34.124
But you accepted without
talking to me about it?

33:36.561 --> 33:37.630
Yeah.

33:45.613 --> 33:46.981
I'm so sorry.

34:01.845 --> 34:03.515
-Hey.
-Hey.

34:04.684 --> 34:06.155
Cassie thought you might
need some help

34:06.188 --> 34:07.357
with your homework.

34:07.390 --> 34:08.559
(SIGHING)

34:08.592 --> 34:10.129
Pre-calculus?

34:10.163 --> 34:12.200
Mmm... Don't you have
any English homework?

34:12.967 --> 34:14.070
I wish.

34:17.041 --> 34:18.279
Can I...

34:19.747 --> 34:21.751
Can I ask you a
question about Mom?

34:22.787 --> 34:24.324
Okay.

34:28.265 --> 34:30.001
Was it strange for you...

34:31.571 --> 34:33.074
...when dad brought
her home?

34:33.642 --> 34:35.011
Strange?

34:36.248 --> 34:37.717
She wasn't your Mom.

34:39.687 --> 34:41.858
You know what I mean.

34:41.891 --> 34:45.333
Well, actually, I think
I brought her home to Dad.

34:46.801 --> 34:48.138
(CHUCKLES)

34:48.171 --> 34:51.878
But Dad would never have
let anyone into our lives

34:51.911 --> 34:55.253
who wasn't really wonderful.

34:55.286 --> 34:59.227
And I know Cassie will do the
same when the time comes.

35:01.096 --> 35:02.098
(CHUCKLES)

35:02.900 --> 35:03.969
What?

35:04.504 --> 35:05.973
Mom was right.

35:07.443 --> 35:08.679
I did need your help.

35:10.416 --> 35:12.820
Well, thank goodness
it wasn't for the math.

35:12.853 --> 35:15.091
-(BOTH LAUGHING)
-True.

35:21.671 --> 35:23.275
MARTHA: Thank you.

35:24.143 --> 35:25.613
You did it anyway?

35:25.646 --> 35:28.117
-What, what did I do?
-Java Shed.

35:28.151 --> 35:30.389
The franchise is coming,
and to Main Street!

35:30.423 --> 35:33.662
Not because of me.
I told them to take their
business elsewhere.

35:33.695 --> 35:36.401
Well, someone is bringing
that store here.

35:36.435 --> 35:38.171
Well, it's not me.

35:38.204 --> 35:39.941
And anyway,
there is no space
on Main Street.

35:44.015 --> 35:45.953
Well, that's enough
tea and enough sympathy.

35:46.788 --> 35:48.224
You're late for Ryan.

35:48.258 --> 35:49.561
I called him, explained.

35:49.594 --> 35:51.129
I'm meeting him
for a late dessert.

35:51.164 --> 35:52.400
Hmm... His parents?

35:52.433 --> 35:54.236
I'll meet them
the next time
they're in town.

35:58.912 --> 36:00.047
What?

36:00.081 --> 36:02.720
Well, speaking of Ryan
and your shop...

36:02.753 --> 36:04.055
I made some phone calls

36:04.089 --> 36:06.961
and I found the corporation
that bought your building.

36:06.995 --> 36:09.467
And I made an offer
to buy it back.

36:11.136 --> 36:12.239
You did?

36:13.241 --> 36:14.411
But he won't budge.

36:14.977 --> 36:16.214
(SIGHS)

36:16.247 --> 36:19.587
Seems he's got big plans
for your shop that
don't include you.

36:20.623 --> 36:21.658
Oh.

36:22.860 --> 36:23.929
It's hard to believe
Ryan's involved.

36:25.499 --> 36:26.635
Ryan?

36:26.668 --> 36:27.803
Yeah, Jones are the buyers.

36:28.739 --> 36:29.774
You didn't know?

36:30.208 --> 36:31.545
Ryan's Jones?

36:32.178 --> 36:33.649
(SIGHS)

36:33.682 --> 36:35.653
Yeah. One and the same.

36:35.686 --> 36:36.855
He didn't tell you?

36:36.888 --> 36:40.194
-I don't... No, he didn't.
-Oh.

36:40.228 --> 36:43.469
I'm sorry, Cassie,
but you should know.

36:45.372 --> 36:46.741
Yeah, now I do.

37:00.302 --> 37:03.509
I don't think Dad's
going to let me go.

37:03.542 --> 37:06.781
Yes. Yes, just apply
the whole balance.
Thank you.

37:07.382 --> 37:08.384
(CELLPHONE BEEPS)

37:09.320 --> 37:10.355
Listen, sweetheart,

37:11.591 --> 37:14.864
I want you to let me worry
about your father, okay?

37:14.897 --> 37:17.503
He stole you from me
once, and I'm not going
to let him do it again.

37:19.306 --> 37:20.308
"Stole?"

37:24.617 --> 37:25.653
Hey.

37:26.588 --> 37:28.057
Hey.

37:28.090 --> 37:31.330
Um, a Stephanie called.

37:31.364 --> 37:33.434
How many women
do you have in
this town anyway?

37:34.571 --> 37:36.173
Nick, can I talk to
your mother, please?

37:36.206 --> 37:39.280
-(NICK SCOFFING)
-Nick. Nick, it's okay.

37:39.313 --> 37:40.783
(SAM SCOFFING)

37:48.298 --> 37:50.669
I understand you
not wanting to talk
about your girlfriends

37:50.703 --> 37:53.308
in front of him,
but he knows.

37:53.775 --> 37:54.777
SAM: Friend.

37:55.512 --> 37:56.715
She's a friend.

38:01.290 --> 38:03.260
And you're not taking
him to Hong Kong.

38:04.430 --> 38:06.199
You're not
taking him anywhere.

38:06.233 --> 38:08.672
Sam, doesn't he
have a say in
who he lives with

38:08.705 --> 38:10.609
-and where he lives?
-SAM: No!

38:10.643 --> 38:12.211
He's a kid!

38:12.245 --> 38:14.215
We're supposed
to be the adults.

38:14.249 --> 38:15.619
We're supposed
to tell him what to do,

38:15.653 --> 38:16.788
not the other way around.

38:16.821 --> 38:18.558
Sam, he wants
to come with me.

38:19.727 --> 38:20.829
You need to leave.

38:21.765 --> 38:23.434
Tonight.

38:23.468 --> 38:26.139
Before you cause
any more trouble.

38:26.173 --> 38:27.777
Nick doesn't
want me leaving.

38:27.810 --> 38:29.179
It's not his house.

38:29.212 --> 38:30.448
NICK: It is.

38:31.918 --> 38:33.689
And she's my mom.

38:35.057 --> 38:36.059
Go back to your room.

38:36.594 --> 38:37.830
No, Dad.

38:37.863 --> 38:39.366
You're not gonna
bully Mom anymore.

38:41.203 --> 38:42.271
"Bully?"

38:42.305 --> 38:44.142
You're not gonna
win this time, Sam.

38:45.044 --> 38:47.015
I'm not gonna
let you win.

38:47.048 --> 38:48.819
NICK: You've had me
for long enough.

38:48.852 --> 38:52.291
I want to be with her
and she wants to be with me.

38:52.325 --> 38:54.630
I know what you did,
and you can't get
away with it again.

38:57.369 --> 38:59.005
What did you tell him?

38:59.039 --> 39:00.307
The truth.

39:01.911 --> 39:04.082
You don't get
to steal me
from her twice.

39:11.163 --> 39:13.634
You should have
just let him come
to Hong Kong with me.

40:01.831 --> 40:03.801
-Ryan?
-Yeah.

40:04.470 --> 40:05.906
Tell me it isn't true.

40:05.939 --> 40:07.609
-It's true.
-Oh, no.

40:07.642 --> 40:09.279
But I'm working
on it, Steph.

40:09.312 --> 40:11.650
If he moves
that coffee chain
into Cassie's shop,

40:11.684 --> 40:14.623
it's going to
kill my business
and break her heart.

40:14.656 --> 40:17.829
I just found out about this.
Give me some time.

40:17.863 --> 40:20.001
And you didn't bother
to tell me or Cassie?

40:20.034 --> 40:21.369
I wanted to fix it first.

40:22.005 --> 40:23.140
Well, is it fixed?

40:23.841 --> 40:25.778
No.

40:25.812 --> 40:29.185
Jones is going to turn
Bell, Book and Candle
into a Java Shed.

40:30.488 --> 40:32.025
This is going to
affect the whole town.

40:32.058 --> 40:35.097
Look, if we wanted to live
in Blairsville, we would.

40:35.131 --> 40:37.301
We are not a chain
store kind of place.

40:37.335 --> 40:38.471
I know.

40:41.911 --> 40:43.113
Does Cassie know?

40:53.167 --> 40:54.703
I think she knows.

41:08.898 --> 41:10.802
