00:05.670 --> 00:08.673
Previously on The Secret Life
of the American Teenager...

00:08.688 --> 00:10.894
By any chance, has Ethan been with you?

00:10.901 --> 00:12.606
He should be halfway to Texas by now.

00:12.591 --> 00:14.085
We're gonna miss you around here.

00:14.116 --> 00:15.312
Thanks for everything.

00:15.336 --> 00:16.337
So what's next?

00:16.360 --> 00:18.152
Kathy had to move away from home.

00:18.160 --> 00:21.045
That's what you get when you're
a teenager and you get pregnant.

00:21.100 --> 00:22.453
I don't want to get married.

00:22.492 --> 00:23.571
But you're already married.

00:23.579 --> 00:24.784
No, I'm not. We lied.

00:24.799 --> 00:26.058
I'm getting the cast off,

00:26.074 --> 00:28.264
and I'm getting back on the
field before spring training.

00:28.311 --> 00:29.773
What about your broken leg?

00:29.773 --> 00:31.040
I prayed that my bones would heal.

00:31.259 --> 00:33.394
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.

00:33.409 --> 00:35.568
I guess things went pretty
much like we thought they would.

00:35.558 --> 00:37.611
I'm gonna march out of here
and you're gonna go with me,

00:37.602 --> 00:38.745
and they're not gonna stop you.

00:38.755 --> 00:40.173
Yes, they are.

00:40.173 --> 00:41.248
It's time to say goodbye.

00:41.368 --> 00:42.763
I had a test done way back when.

00:42.802 --> 00:45.999
You mean to tell me you've known
all along that Robie is my son?

00:46.038 --> 00:48.345
You haven't been the father and
you're not going to be the father.

00:48.365 --> 00:50.721
I got a check for a million dollars.

00:50.841 --> 00:54.494
I know your doctors have suggested
that you get some counseling.

00:54.455 --> 00:56.635
I don't need a psychiatrist,
I just need a saw.

00:56.655 --> 00:58.024
I am so happy to see you!

00:58.063 --> 01:00.077
They're just letting me stay
until the end of the school year.

01:00.087 --> 01:00.937
"Then we'll see."

01:00.937 --> 01:03.166
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:07.751 --> 01:09.736
Dad! Where are you?

01:12.365 --> 01:14.633
- Oh, hey. Good morning.
- Where is he?

01:15.073 --> 01:17.126
He who? Ricky?

01:17.165 --> 01:18.573
You know who. My dad.

01:18.592 --> 01:20.801
He's been lying to my mother
all this time about Robie?

01:20.831 --> 01:24.164
Uh, who? Huh? Say what?

01:24.164 --> 01:25.240
Where is he?

01:25.279 --> 01:26.735
I have no idea.

01:27.821 --> 01:30.411
I think he was going to stay
over at Kathleen's last night.

01:30.421 --> 01:33.246
That's why I have Moose, 'cause
it was a sleepover, wasn't it?

01:33.276 --> 01:35.817
I don't care about the dog. I
just want to know where my dad is.

01:35.847 --> 01:37.890
- Is he at Kathleen's?
- Well, I think he was,

01:37.880 --> 01:41.350
but by now, he could be
at a convenience store,

01:41.350 --> 01:44.508
or one of those biscuit
places, Putt-Putt, I don't know.

01:44.628 --> 01:46.988
Hey, sorry, I was in the
shower. Have you been here long?

01:47.108 --> 01:48.775
What's going on?

01:54.450 --> 01:56.356
- Is something going on?
- You tell me.

01:56.376 --> 01:58.048
You tell me if something's going on.

01:58.087 --> 01:59.729
You lied about being Robie's father?

01:59.849 --> 02:00.667
David told you?

02:00.697 --> 02:02.749
David did not tell me. Mom told me.

02:02.720 --> 02:03.962
She's so upset!

02:03.981 --> 02:06.581
- With me?
- Yes, with you! You lied to her!

02:06.701 --> 02:10.443
You lied to me, and Ashley and to Robie!

02:10.442 --> 02:12.221
Dad, you lied to a baby!

02:12.241 --> 02:13.453
I had to lie.

02:13.453 --> 02:15.759
David was a big coward. He
wasn't going to come through.

02:15.879 --> 02:18.614
I stepped up. If I hadn't,
that kid wouldn't have a father.

02:18.594 --> 02:21.742
- I'm a hero, damn it.
- You are not a hero. You're a liar.

02:21.862 --> 02:23.600
You could have just told Mom
that you weren't the father

02:23.609 --> 02:27.705
and if you wanted to step up, you could
still step up and act like a father,

02:27.725 --> 02:31.029
but to actually claim that
you're a father when you weren't?

02:31.149 --> 02:32.984
Oh, my God! Dad!

02:32.984 --> 02:34.421
Isn't that the pot
calling the kettle black?

02:34.450 --> 02:36.327
- What?
- You lied about your wedding, didn't you?

02:36.357 --> 02:37.706
- What?
- Yeah, you lied.

02:37.826 --> 02:40.883
I saw the DVD and then I had to lie and
say I hadn't seen the DVD for your sake.

02:40.883 --> 02:42.887
Just like I lied to
your mother for her sake.

02:43.007 --> 02:44.363
When I lie, it's for my family.

02:44.363 --> 02:45.683
When you lie, it's for you.

02:45.712 --> 02:48.459
All right, all right,
we knew that you knew.

02:48.723 --> 02:50.394
- Who else have you told?
- No one.

02:50.394 --> 02:52.515
- No one but Kathleen?
- No one!

02:52.635 --> 02:54.422
- Who else have you told?
- Well...

02:54.412 --> 02:56.699
- Ben guessed, but that doesn't really count.
- Why not?

02:56.719 --> 02:59.036
Because he says he looked
it up on the Internet,

02:59.045 --> 03:02.340
but there's all sorts
of lies on the Internet

03:02.340 --> 03:05.038
and misinformation, so...
he just thinks he knows.

03:05.057 --> 03:06.924
- Anyone else?
- Dr. Fields.

03:06.934 --> 03:08.831
- Is that it?
- I think that's it.

03:08.870 --> 03:11.930
But dad, it doesn't make any
difference if anyone finds out

03:11.926 --> 03:13.895
because we're going to get married again.

03:14.015 --> 03:15.899
But you, on the other hand...

03:15.908 --> 03:18.284
dad, you are in serious trouble.

03:18.313 --> 03:20.386
You might have to give
up Robie, you know that?

03:20.405 --> 03:21.784
I'm not giving up Robie.

03:21.784 --> 03:24.228
David said I could work something out
with your mother so I'd still see him.

03:24.228 --> 03:25.372
Maybe I'll even see him more.

03:25.372 --> 03:28.080
Dad, you don't think you can work
something out with her, do you?

03:28.200 --> 03:32.547
Dad, you're probably not going
to see her or Robie again. Ever.

03:32.586 --> 03:34.336
Well, that's not very
nice after what I did.

03:34.345 --> 03:37.102
Dad, you should have
just told Mom the truth.

03:37.222 --> 03:40.689
Geez, our family was freaky
enough before all of this happened.

03:40.709 --> 03:43.036
Did it ever even occur to
you to tell her the truth,

03:43.065 --> 03:44.336
to tell all of us the truth?

03:44.326 --> 03:45.626
People need to hear the truth.

03:45.655 --> 03:47.277
- Oh, do they?
- Yes, they do.

03:47.287 --> 03:49.418
-  Do they?
- I just said that they do.

03:49.448 --> 03:51.628
Then get out there and tell
people you're not married.

03:51.628 --> 03:53.084
And I'd start with your mother.

03:53.319 --> 03:56.069
I think that my mother has
enough to deal with right now.

03:56.104 --> 03:58.655
- Fine. Tell Ricky's mother.
- No. I'm afraid of her.

03:58.665 --> 03:59.936
Tell his other mother, tell Nora.

03:59.946 --> 04:02.605
We're not going to tell anyone, okay?

04:02.634 --> 04:04.169
We're just going to get married again.

04:04.169 --> 04:06.515
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

04:06.544 --> 04:08.197
We're in love again.

04:08.988 --> 04:13.016
We are. Look, Dad, everything
is really good with me and Ricky

04:13.054 --> 04:15.088
and everything is bad with you and Mom.

04:15.352 --> 04:20.180
Which means everything is going
to be bad with you and Robie.

04:20.190 --> 04:21.452
No, it doesn't.

04:21.765 --> 04:24.149
She's not going to keep me from
seeing him or anything like that.

04:25.137 --> 04:26.613
Did she say that?

04:26.906 --> 04:29.008
Well, she can't mean that. I'm
the only dad Robie's ever known.

04:29.037 --> 04:30.591
And he's my son.

04:31.393 --> 04:33.006
He is.

04:55.207 --> 04:57.798
This is why we ran off and
got married in the first place.

04:57.818 --> 05:00.496
Because my family is completely screwed up.

05:00.486 --> 05:02.891
Well you didn't wanna have
another wedding anyway.

05:02.881 --> 05:06.664
Well, no, I didn't, but now I do.

05:07.856 --> 05:09.752
I have a dress and everything, and...

05:09.752 --> 05:11.962
we're kinda excited about it. Both of us.

05:11.991 --> 05:13.663
Then why don't you move up the date?

05:13.702 --> 05:16.332
We could do that, but with
everything going on with Robie...

05:16.322 --> 05:19.108
If you don't do this
soon, like, really soon,

05:19.108 --> 05:20.839
you might not get both your parents there.

05:20.848 --> 05:22.843
I don't care what else is
going on in their lives,

05:22.852 --> 05:25.394
I'm sure both of my parents
are going to be at my wedding.

05:25.514 --> 05:28.923
My mom's arranging everything, and
is going to be at my dad's house.

05:31.005 --> 05:34.242
What? They're not going to to
let their crisis spill over to

05:34.232 --> 05:36.099
John and Ricky and me.

05:37.702 --> 05:40.664
I have to make a phone call. Bye.

05:45.980 --> 05:47.224
Hi, Mom.

05:47.344 --> 05:49.423
You didn't need to tell your
dad that I'm upset with him.

05:49.423 --> 05:51.232
Well, I'm upset with him, too.

05:51.261 --> 05:53.754
This is between your dad and me and David.

05:53.754 --> 05:56.012
Excuse me, but Robie is my brother.

05:56.132 --> 05:57.713
Half-brother, apparently.

05:57.713 --> 05:59.199
That doesn't change anything.

05:59.189 --> 06:02.171
For you. So just stay out of it, Amy.

06:10.510 --> 06:11.488
Hello?

06:11.517 --> 06:12.856
Mom, did you just hang up on me?

06:12.876 --> 06:14.166
I thought we were finished talking.

06:14.286 --> 06:16.659
No, I want to ask you about the wedding.

06:16.779 --> 06:19.621
Just forget the wedding. You're
already married, so it's redundant

06:19.631 --> 06:22.085
and I don't feel like doing anything
that involves your father right now.

06:22.114 --> 06:24.802
- What?
- You're married. Is that everything?

06:26.181 --> 06:28.722
Uh, yeah, I guess so.

06:29.651 --> 06:31.860
- Have a nice day.
- Have a nice life with Ricky.

06:31.893 --> 06:34.100
Mom, it sounds like
you're breaking up with us.

06:34.119 --> 06:37.571
Amy, you can't even imagine
what I'm going through right now.

06:37.600 --> 06:38.920
It's crazy.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.158
I have to meet with David's
stupid attorney today.

06:41.139 --> 06:42.380
He's sending him here.

06:42.500 --> 06:43.495
All right.

06:43.615 --> 06:45.870
So I didn't mean to hurt your
feelings about the wedding,

06:45.890 --> 06:48.490
but you and Ricky weren't all
that excited about it anyway,

06:48.510 --> 06:50.338
and I have other priorities now.

06:50.458 --> 06:51.423
All right.

06:51.453 --> 06:52.913
Anything else?

06:53.033 --> 06:54.913
I guess not.

06:55.033 --> 06:58.393
You want to tell me that you hope that
everything goes well with the attorney today?

06:58.393 --> 07:01.902
I hope everything goes
well. I really do. Bye, Mom.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.896
Bye.

07:04.385 --> 07:07.923
Hey, so I guess I'll get out of
here before the attorney shows up.

07:07.943 --> 07:09.692
Why? You don't have to hide from him.

07:09.732 --> 07:11.677
David knows that I'm in a relationship.

07:11.797 --> 07:15.460
I know, but you really need to
focus on mom stuff right now,

07:15.460 --> 07:16.995
and I'm just a distraction,

07:17.025 --> 07:20.778
so I will call you tonight. Or
you just call me when he leaves.

07:21.071 --> 07:24.415
Well, it would be really nice to have
someone here for me when he leaves.

07:24.962 --> 07:27.464
Yeah, but I have to go tonight anyway.

07:27.503 --> 07:30.690
I have my AA meeting tonight,
and I ahve work tomorrow,

07:30.700 --> 07:32.088
and lawyers make me nervous.

07:32.208 --> 07:33.095
Why's that?

07:33.134 --> 07:35.087
- My father was a lawyer.
- Oh.

07:36.132 --> 07:37.984
Yeah. Well, uh,

07:38.409 --> 07:40.042
this is not your father.

07:41.206 --> 07:43.971
Can't you stay and leave after dinner?

07:44.091 --> 07:46.774
You should have dinner with your mom

07:46.824 --> 07:48.795
since you're not going to
get to go there for lunch.

07:48.915 --> 07:50.372
Well, you can have dinner with us.

07:50.492 --> 07:53.862
Yes, I could, but I'm not going
to, because I want to go home.

07:54.707 --> 07:57.253
Then you should just have said
that instead of making excuses.

07:57.285 --> 07:58.874
Yes, I should have.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.125
Bye.

08:00.245 --> 08:01.277
Bye.

08:06.787 --> 08:09.285
Great. Our first fight.

08:09.304 --> 08:10.868
Like I need this.

08:14.697 --> 08:16.793
I don't know what I'd
do without you, Kathleen.

08:16.980 --> 08:19.771
Mmm. Thank you, George.

08:19.891 --> 08:21.060
No.

08:21.610 --> 08:22.774
Thank you.

08:26.428 --> 08:28.200
All right, well, there's no big wedding,

08:28.201 --> 08:29.201
we can just run off again.

08:29.157 --> 08:31.941
I want a wedding. I want the
wedding my mom planned for us.

08:31.954 --> 08:33.980
Oh, please Amy, we talked
ourselves into that,

08:33.999 --> 08:35.337
we can talk ourselves out of it.

08:35.457 --> 08:37.046
You never wanted a
wedding in the first place

08:37.058 --> 08:38.015
because of your mother

08:37.996 --> 08:40.037
now there's Willowdine
and David to worry about.

08:40.157 --> 08:41.451
Well they can all come.

08:41.571 --> 08:44.767
Or we can go to city hall, just do it.

08:44.785 --> 08:46.468
I don't want to just do it.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.852
It's not a race. It's
a wedding, our wedding.

08:48.890 --> 08:50.617
Last time we just ran off and got married,

08:50.623 --> 08:52.325
we did everything but get married.

08:52.294 --> 08:53.289
All right,  well,

08:53.409 --> 08:55.747
look, you know your mom and dad.
No matter how much they fight,

08:55.770 --> 08:57.993
they always end up making up.
They've known each other forever.

08:58.001 --> 09:00.815
I'm sure that by the time
we're supposed to get married,

09:00.834 --> 09:02.129
everything will be fine,

09:02.249 --> 09:04.425
and the wedding will take
place just like it was planned.

09:05.079 --> 09:06.947
- You think so?
- Sure.

09:06.981 --> 09:08.674
If that's what you want.

09:08.794 --> 09:10.288
Yeah. That's what I want.

09:10.607 --> 09:12.484
Then that's what will happen.

09:15.700 --> 09:18.991
Because you always get what you want.

09:29.749 --> 09:32.848
- Morning.
- Uh, almost afternoon.

09:33.130 --> 09:35.438
Yeah, but obviously you just got up.

09:35.822 --> 09:37.847
Wasn't expecting anybody
in the middle of the day.

09:37.890 --> 09:41.037
Yeah, my doctor asked me to
come in and bring in my meds,

09:41.106 --> 09:43.752
so I just wanted to get a sandwich first.

09:44.328 --> 09:46.731
You're not taking too many of
that pain medication, are you?

09:46.766 --> 09:49.720
No. I'm not. I'm not taking it at
all, so my doctor asked for proof.

09:49.769 --> 09:50.790
When are you getting the casts off?

09:50.910 --> 09:51.923
I hope today.

09:51.973 --> 09:53.042
I thought you had a few more weeks.

09:53.061 --> 09:55.589
That's only because secular
doctors don't believe in miracles,

09:55.614 --> 09:58.623
despite the fact that I came
out of a coma on Christmas Eve.

09:59.155 --> 10:00.123
What's a secular doctor?

10:00.123 --> 10:01.575
Is that some kind of
bone doctor? What is it?

10:01.695 --> 10:03.896
No. It's what you get when you
can't find a Christian doctor.

10:04.497 --> 10:06.443
Oh. I get it.

10:06.500 --> 10:09.603
I can't find one good Christian
orthopedic guy that'll agree with me.

10:09.723 --> 10:10.956
At least not around here.

10:10.990 --> 10:13.357
Have you ever taken the time
to go see that other doctor?

10:13.382 --> 10:15.428
- The head doctor?
- No.

10:15.678 --> 10:17.337
Because?

10:17.930 --> 10:20.628
- Secular?
- I don't know, but I don't need that.

10:20.665 --> 10:22.955
Really? That was a pretty
traumatic experience.

10:22.974 --> 10:24.469
Yeah, well, I don't remember any of it.

10:24.525 --> 10:26.089
You know, those guys can be really helpful.

10:26.083 --> 10:28.198
When Anne and I were breaking
up, I went to see Dr. Fields.

10:28.211 --> 10:29.187
He's a good man.

10:29.307 --> 10:30.651
That's your traumatic incident,

10:30.669 --> 10:32.384
breaking up with your wife who's now gay?

10:32.504 --> 10:34.012
The marriage was traumatic, all right?

10:34.046 --> 10:36.625
And I'm sure getting the crap
beaten out of you is traumatic, too.

10:36.613 --> 10:39.310
Yeah, well, it could have been a
car accident or a football injury

10:39.335 --> 10:41.087
as far as I'm concerned.
I don't remember any of it.

10:41.105 --> 10:42.438
Okay. If you say so.

10:42.501 --> 10:44.578
So, you want me to drive
you to this secular doctor?

10:44.590 --> 10:47.800
Nope. I'm good. I got Jesus as my copilot.

10:47.920 --> 10:49.633
Ever noticed those bumper stickers?

10:50.377 --> 10:51.686
He's a hell of a busy copilot.

10:51.711 --> 10:53.675
You'd think he'd get bumped
up to pilot at some point.

10:53.863 --> 10:55.002
I like that.

10:55.008 --> 10:56.572
I might put that on a bumper sticker.

10:56.692 --> 10:57.511
It's all yours, but

10:57.504 --> 10:59.562
if you make more than one
of 'em, I want a percentage.

10:59.587 --> 11:01.721
- You take care.
- You, too, and hey, you know,

11:01.746 --> 11:05.306
prayer works, so maybe if you prayed
about your situation with Robie,

11:05.306 --> 11:07.352
he'd turn out to be your son after all.

11:07.472 --> 11:09.435
Okay. Bye now.

11:17.862 --> 11:20.859
Hey, I just wanted to check
on Jack. How's he doing?

11:20.871 --> 11:22.186
He's fantastic! Yeah.

11:22.306 --> 11:24.119
Thanks. I'll tell him you asked.

11:24.125 --> 11:25.489
Oh, that's okay.

11:25.502 --> 11:27.473
He probably doesn't need
to be reminded of me.

11:27.748 --> 11:29.149
I just wanted to know for myself.

11:29.149 --> 11:30.469
That's so sweet of you.

11:30.501 --> 11:34.073
Yeah, especially considering
I almost got him killed.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.638
Oh, no guilt. He's going to be fine.

11:36.857 --> 11:38.046
And so are you.

11:38.911 --> 11:41.444
Why don't you think about coming
to church with me sometime?

11:41.944 --> 11:44.140
Uh... No, thanks.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.867
I kind of carry a grudge.

11:45.867 --> 11:47.018
Really?

11:47.500 --> 11:49.295
But you have such a nice life now.

11:49.564 --> 11:51.867
Yeah, the past 90 days have been

11:51.987 --> 11:53.944
great compared to the last couple of years.

11:55.702 --> 11:56.728
See ya.

11:59.744 --> 12:01.681
We saw the pictures.

12:01.801 --> 12:03.811
Ethan showed you pictures of my house?

12:03.803 --> 12:06.558
House? Don't you mean your estate?

12:06.839 --> 12:08.785
Well, it takes a lot
of room to raise horses.

12:08.835 --> 12:10.212
I just feel betrayed.

12:10.237 --> 12:12.877
Why? Because I live in a big house?

12:12.912 --> 12:15.022
Property is a lot cheaper in Texas.

12:15.254 --> 12:17.669
Nothing about that house looked cheap.

12:17.675 --> 12:21.685
And we feel betrayed because you didn't
tell us that you live like royalty.

12:21.710 --> 12:23.312
You both have very nice houses.

12:23.432 --> 12:25.890
I live in a condo with my mother.

12:26.189 --> 12:28.808
It's a big condo, and your
mother is an interior decorator.

12:28.804 --> 12:30.018
It's beautiful!

12:30.138 --> 12:31.997
Not like your closet, I'm sure.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.204
So we can't hang out with you anymore.

12:34.324 --> 12:36.537
Yeah, we don't like girls
who are richer than us.

12:36.657 --> 12:38.651
I'm not rich. My father's rich.

12:38.771 --> 12:41.605
And I don't even have a father,

12:41.617 --> 12:43.225
so thanks for rubbing that in.

12:43.257 --> 12:44.876
And I don't have horses.

12:44.877 --> 12:45.997
Not even one.

12:46.598 --> 12:47.680
Good-bye.

12:52.391 --> 12:55.050
Hey, what's up with the snark sisters?

12:55.237 --> 12:57.221
Apparently they don't
want to be my friends.

12:57.341 --> 13:00.074
Oh, good, so you're friendless right now?

13:00.194 --> 13:02.244
Do you want to be friends
with a former hooker?

13:02.826 --> 13:04.059
Who am I to judge?

13:04.103 --> 13:06.612
I just had a baby. So, sure.

13:06.732 --> 13:08.269
Hey, how are you, Chloe?

13:08.326 --> 13:10.378
I'm great. I just made a friend.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.399
Great. Great. Um,

13:12.431 --> 13:14.333
I need to talk to Kathy for a minute.

13:14.508 --> 13:15.929
And I need to talk to you.

13:16.241 --> 13:18.255
You can talk to me later, girlfriend.

13:18.375 --> 13:19.683
Bye. Bye, Ethan.

13:24.319 --> 13:26.396
You can't be friends with a hooker.

13:26.886 --> 13:28.022
She's not a hooker.

13:28.048 --> 13:30.632
She was forced into being a
sex slave by some criminal.

13:30.663 --> 13:32.415
Your father wouldn't want this.

13:32.477 --> 13:34.391
My father doesn't get to choose my friends

13:34.398 --> 13:35.743
or you wouldn't be my friend either.

13:35.799 --> 13:37.025
No, you don't understand,

13:37.018 --> 13:39.364
juvenile delinquent is on
a completely different level

13:39.383 --> 13:41.173
than hooker.

13:41.379 --> 13:42.767
You're right.

13:42.831 --> 13:45.103
She's a victim and you've
chosen to be a delinquent.

13:45.315 --> 13:46.598
I'm a victim as well.

13:46.792 --> 13:48.006
Not at this point.

13:48.040 --> 13:51.678
At this point, you've got
parents and your own home...

13:52.204 --> 13:55.228
And speaking of homes, you're
showing my parents' house to people?

13:55.348 --> 13:56.929
It's impressive.

13:56.934 --> 13:58.461
I'm not trying to impress anyone.

13:58.581 --> 14:01.383
That's because you're rich.
And rich people are confident.

14:01.420 --> 14:04.624
Uh, you're not exactly
lacking confidence yourself.

14:04.744 --> 14:05.944
But I'm faking it.

14:06.333 --> 14:07.514
This is an act.

14:07.634 --> 14:09.461
I feel totally inferior to you,

14:09.467 --> 14:11.296
especially now that I've
seen how you were living.

14:11.330 --> 14:13.841
So, what are you saying? You
want to break up with me, too?

14:13.866 --> 14:15.412
No, not at all, babe.

14:15.532 --> 14:17.745
I'm hoping to have half
that house some day.

14:18.339 --> 14:20.348
Just because my parents
let me come back with you

14:20.358 --> 14:22.575
does not mean they would
ever let me marry you.

14:23.008 --> 14:24.408
Doesn't mean they wouldn't.

14:24.878 --> 14:26.761
Your father doesn't get
to pick your friends,

14:26.767 --> 14:28.212
but he can pick your husband?

14:28.247 --> 14:31.379
I just had a baby. I don't
want to think about boyfriends

14:31.391 --> 14:34.057
or husbands or anything
serious right now, okay?

14:34.539 --> 14:37.411
The only thing I want to be
serious about right now is school.

14:37.531 --> 14:38.981
What do you need school for?

14:39.032 --> 14:39.983
You're rich.

14:45.006 --> 14:46.007
Hey.

14:46.127 --> 14:47.828
There you are. I was looking for you.

14:48.067 --> 14:49.234
You were?

14:49.268 --> 14:50.781
Yeah, I...

14:51.438 --> 14:53.540
heard all about the Robie situation.

14:53.578 --> 14:55.474
Yeah. I figured you had.

14:55.542 --> 14:57.188
Then why didn't you come
and talk to me about it?

14:57.376 --> 15:00.786
I mean, I have a half-brother,
and believe me, it's not easy.

15:01.349 --> 15:05.760
Yeah, Grace, your situation is hardly
the same situation as my situation.

15:05.935 --> 15:07.161
Mine is worse.

15:07.217 --> 15:09.032
I didn't even know that
I had a half-brother.

15:09.307 --> 15:10.890
Well, I didn't even know

15:10.909 --> 15:13.139
that my brother was only my half-brother.

15:13.468 --> 15:15.908
Which sounds completely stupid.

15:15.926 --> 15:17.143
He's not half-anything.

15:17.322 --> 15:20.143
Yeah, Tom has this whole thing about
calling anyone half-anything, too,

15:20.132 --> 15:23.321
so we started calling Jacob
brother instead of half-brother,

15:23.822 --> 15:25.423
but then he took off, so...

15:25.442 --> 15:27.388
Half or whole, were
not good enough for him.

15:27.508 --> 15:28.571
Look, Grace.

15:28.590 --> 15:30.636
I know that you mean well,

15:31.277 --> 15:34.803
but this is upsetting for
a whole lot of reasons.

15:35.247 --> 15:37.580
One being that my mom has now decided

15:37.586 --> 15:39.951
that Ricky and I don't need a wedding

15:39.964 --> 15:42.222
with everything that's going on.

15:42.254 --> 15:44.625
It would be a shame to waste that dress.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.822
Joking. I'm sure she'll come around.

15:47.841 --> 15:50.355
I'm not so sure, but maybe.

15:50.631 --> 15:52.307
See you, Grace.

16:07.112 --> 16:08.863
- Hi, Grace.
- Mom,

16:08.919 --> 16:11.030
Amy just told me that she and Ricky
aren't having a wedding anymore

16:11.150 --> 16:12.630
because of the whole Robie situation,

16:12.662 --> 16:14.733
but her mom is too upset
with George to have a wedding.

16:14.789 --> 16:17.335
So I was thinking we should do that!

16:17.529 --> 16:18.924
Or we should help George do that.

16:18.937 --> 16:21.120
I mean, you wanted me to
reach out to Amy, so...

16:21.402 --> 16:22.721
This is a pretty big reach,

16:22.721 --> 16:24.961
and we could look at it as
a trial run for my wedding.

16:25.164 --> 16:28.151
Grace, there are two other mothers
who would have to be consulted.

16:28.220 --> 16:29.697
Yeah, but you're practically her stepmother

16:29.734 --> 16:31.330
and I'm practically her stepsister.

16:31.355 --> 16:32.800
And, if we could get in on this wedding,

16:32.819 --> 16:35.109
it would finally start to
feel like we're all one family.

16:35.140 --> 16:36.874
Isn't that what you want?

16:37.142 --> 16:39.043
Is that what you want?

16:39.078 --> 16:40.746
I just want something else to do right now.

16:40.740 --> 16:42.548
Jack is really starting to get to me.

16:42.792 --> 16:44.506
He just refuses to get help. I just...

16:44.688 --> 16:46.684
I really want something
happy to think about.

16:47.641 --> 16:48.923
Please, Mom?

16:57.237 --> 16:59.267
So, did you talk to Grace today?

16:59.298 --> 17:00.718
Don't I talk to her every day?

17:00.838 --> 17:02.633
And you asked her about Jack?

17:02.696 --> 17:04.835
I ask her about Jack every day.

17:06.130 --> 17:07.830
- Too often?
- I don't know.

17:07.881 --> 17:09.577
It may seem too often to Grace,

17:09.583 --> 17:11.892
to have you bring up such a
touchy subject all the time.

17:12.012 --> 17:14.512
But at the same time, it may
not seem often enough for you

17:14.531 --> 17:16.021
because you're worried about Jack and...

17:16.046 --> 17:17.385
you want him to be okay.

17:17.810 --> 17:19.824
So, how's he doing?

17:19.824 --> 17:23.076
I don't know. All Grace ever
says is, "He's fantastic."

17:23.195 --> 17:24.984
And you don't think he's fantastic?

17:24.992 --> 17:27.432
I don't think he's as
fantastic as she says he is.

17:27.425 --> 17:28.665
Nobody's that fantastic,

17:28.702 --> 17:30.055
especially a person who's

17:30.111 --> 17:32.201
recovering from what he's recovering from.

17:32.232 --> 17:33.734
So you think she's lying?

17:33.777 --> 17:35.004
I know she's lying.

17:35.035 --> 17:37.263
I know when people are lying.
I've told you that before.

17:37.383 --> 17:40.498
Well, then don't ask her how
he's doing and just talk to her.

17:40.618 --> 17:41.981
Tell her what you've been going through,

17:41.981 --> 17:43.295
the problems you're struggling with,

17:43.308 --> 17:45.090
and then maybe she'll
get some understanding

17:45.097 --> 17:46.686
about what Jack's going
through and help him.

17:46.806 --> 17:48.513
That's kind of personal, isn't it?

17:48.633 --> 17:51.448
To talk about what I'm going
through or what I've been through.

17:51.673 --> 17:54.360
- Besides, I'm...
- Fantastic?

17:59.432 --> 18:01.633
I think we actually could reduce the casts

18:01.665 --> 18:03.122
so that you're a little more comfortable.

18:03.242 --> 18:04.303
It's not bothering me.

18:04.423 --> 18:05.681
On the other hand, I really don't think

18:05.687 --> 18:07.207
it's necessary at all anymore.

18:07.244 --> 18:09.472
Well, the X-rays say otherwise.

18:10.041 --> 18:11.987
The bones aren't healed yet,

18:12.237 --> 18:14.226
but I don't think you need
that much support at this point.

18:14.346 --> 18:15.384
You're doing good.

18:15.504 --> 18:17.154
You're healing normally.

18:17.354 --> 18:18.165
I'm healed.

18:18.285 --> 18:19.525
You're not healed.

18:19.819 --> 18:21.108
The lord told me I am.

18:21.133 --> 18:22.791
And where did he go to medical school?

18:24.411 --> 18:26.482
Come on, Jack. It's a little joke.

18:26.551 --> 18:29.667
You've seen the X-rays.
You've seen what is.

18:29.980 --> 18:31.682
You can't argue with what is.

18:32.282 --> 18:33.796
Why do you want to believe
that the bones are healed

18:33.809 --> 18:35.642
and that you don't need
any pain medication?

18:36.436 --> 18:38.075
It's okay to take a little pain medication.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.959
Maybe the reason you're so stressed is that

18:40.153 --> 18:41.986
you're in pain every minute, every day.

18:42.106 --> 18:44.026
It might help to reduce your discomfort.

18:44.020 --> 18:46.329
I'll try to help you out
with the new casts, but...

18:46.761 --> 18:48.657
Maybe just before you go to bed,

18:48.963 --> 18:50.734
take something to help you sleep.

18:51.309 --> 18:52.561
I think you need the rest.

18:52.805 --> 18:54.282
I'm getting plenty of rest.

18:54.664 --> 18:56.866
Are you still staying at Grace's
or did you go back to the dorm?

18:56.897 --> 18:57.987
I'm at Grace's house.

18:58.107 --> 19:00.183
She wants me there and I'm fine there.

19:00.303 --> 19:02.416
You are one stubborn guy.

19:02.604 --> 19:04.900
Look, I want you to go see Dr. Chan.

19:04.901 --> 19:07.259
Just talk to him for an hour, okay?

19:07.278 --> 19:09.655
I don't need it. It would
just be a waste of an hour.

19:09.775 --> 19:12.721
What if your coach made it conditional
to getting back on the team?

19:13.077 --> 19:14.360
He's not gonna do that.

19:14.391 --> 19:15.799
He did do that.

19:16.199 --> 19:19.065
Jack, you can't be on the
team and live at Grace's house.

19:20.059 --> 19:21.205
What's going on?

19:21.455 --> 19:24.583
What's going on is that everyone
refuses to believe that I'm okay,

19:24.965 --> 19:26.642
physically, mentally, spiritually.

19:26.648 --> 19:28.663
I'm fine. I'm just fine.

19:29.413 --> 19:31.090
No, you're not.

19:39.917 --> 19:41.956
Sorry, doll, was out on
a long walk with Moose.

19:42.076 --> 19:44.903
Good, that's good. Walking
is always good for stress.

19:45.191 --> 19:46.474
So is what we were doing.

19:46.594 --> 19:49.233
Yeah, that's good for a lot of things.

19:50.116 --> 19:52.393
Look, honey, Grace called.

19:52.424 --> 19:54.257
She said that Amy told her

19:54.295 --> 19:55.608
that Anne has called off the wedding.

19:55.621 --> 19:57.298
- So I was...
- Anne did what?

19:57.354 --> 19:58.374
Uh...

19:58.730 --> 20:01.039
She called off Amy and Ricky's wedding?

20:01.087 --> 20:02.028
She better not have.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.992
Well, maybe Grace heard wrong, or...

20:04.223 --> 20:06.420
I thought that maybe that was
part of why you were so upset

20:06.457 --> 20:07.483
and just hadn't told me.

20:07.483 --> 20:09.886
No, I'm upset because Robie's
father is trying to take him from me.

20:10.080 --> 20:12.050
I want a wedding. And there
damn well better be a wedding.

20:12.050 --> 20:13.089
Okay,

20:13.466 --> 20:16.362
well, if it doesn't work out that
anyone else wants to arrange...

20:16.412 --> 20:18.427
Oh, it's going to work
out. I'll call you later.

20:19.021 --> 20:20.035
Oh, man.

20:21.380 --> 20:23.409
Excuse me, that's the liar now.

20:25.635 --> 20:27.981
- Anne?
- I'm in a meeting.

20:28.025 --> 20:29.883
What the hell did you do?
You canceled Amy's wedding?

20:29.927 --> 20:31.434
You can't cancel Amy's wedding!

20:31.554 --> 20:32.842
You don't know what the hell you're doing!

20:32.905 --> 20:34.556
They're getting married!
They're getting married in...

20:35.482 --> 20:37.140
You were saying?

20:37.190 --> 20:39.374
Robie will be treated
with the same consideration

20:39.393 --> 20:41.094
as the girls in all matters,

20:41.470 --> 20:44.355
including the sizable
inheritance from the grandparents.

20:44.423 --> 20:47.671
"They're beyond thrilled."
I'm quoting David's mother.

20:48.109 --> 20:50.261
- She hated me.
- Not now.

20:50.381 --> 20:51.925
She'd like to get to know you.

20:52.332 --> 20:54.578
She'd like to have lunch, brunch, dinner,

20:54.572 --> 20:56.242
whatever you'd like to have.

20:56.474 --> 20:58.607
She wants you to feel
comfortable in their home,

20:58.638 --> 21:00.703
and bringing Robie over to their home.

21:00.823 --> 21:03.398
And if I'd like to bring my
girlfriend, Willowdine, with me?

21:03.430 --> 21:04.931
They're fine with that.

21:05.051 --> 21:07.308
Yeah, well, I don't know
if I'm fine with all this.

21:07.365 --> 21:09.254
It would be best for Robie

21:09.374 --> 21:11.956
if everyone remains amicable.

21:15.930 --> 21:17.219
Hi, this is Anne.

21:17.339 --> 21:20.928
Please leave a message and I'll
call you back. Thank you. Beep.

21:21.048 --> 21:23.700
What kind of meeting you in that's so
important that you can't talk to me, huh?

21:23.820 --> 21:25.452
Planning which rug goes with which pillow?

21:25.572 --> 21:26.628
Pick up, damn it!

21:26.647 --> 21:28.398
You talked to me plenty when
you thought I was Robie's father.

21:28.418 --> 21:29.717
And I'm not leaving
this kind of information

21:29.718 --> 21:31.087
on some stupid phone machine, but

21:31.272 --> 21:33.098
Amy and Ricky aren't really married.

21:44.040 --> 21:45.547
Where have you been?

21:45.779 --> 21:47.969
I've been hoping to show
you my ring for days now.

21:48.194 --> 21:49.971
I've been around. Nice ring.

21:50.190 --> 21:53.080
Um, it's an engagement ring.

21:53.825 --> 21:55.608
- Again?
- For real this time.

21:55.728 --> 21:57.673
All right. To Omar?

21:57.723 --> 21:59.988
Of course to Omar. Who else
would I be getting married to?

22:00.019 --> 22:02.703
I don't know. So, when's the wedding?

22:02.740 --> 22:04.529
We haven't set a date yet,

22:04.649 --> 22:07.170
but don't worry, we won't
beat you and Amy to the altar.

22:07.195 --> 22:08.658
We've already been to the altar.

22:08.778 --> 22:10.128
I meant the big altar.

22:10.166 --> 22:12.799
Oh. That wedding is on
hold for the time being.

22:12.831 --> 22:13.750
Tell me about it.

22:13.788 --> 22:15.984
Oh, Amy's family has some stuff going on.

22:16.104 --> 22:18.911
Her family always has stuff going on.

22:18.943 --> 22:20.751
You can't schedule a wedding around

22:20.794 --> 22:22.941
"There's no stuff going
on in Amy's family."

22:22.966 --> 22:24.813
- That would never happen.
- Mmm.

22:24.933 --> 22:26.477
Her brother Robie

22:26.514 --> 22:29.005
turns out to be some other guy's kid, so...

22:29.249 --> 22:31.789
Her mom is upset with George
and George is upset with her mom.

22:31.858 --> 22:33.328
Her mom lied about that?

22:33.384 --> 22:35.143
No, her dad lied and said he was the father

22:35.168 --> 22:37.163
and the other guy thought
he couldn't be the father

22:37.182 --> 22:39.034
and then it turned out that he was.

22:39.154 --> 22:41.199
But George knew he wasn't
the father all along.

22:42.676 --> 22:44.815
Wow, it seems like old times,
talking bout the Juergens.

22:44.828 --> 22:46.842
Well, it's not old times. I'm married now.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.018
I heard that

22:48.138 --> 22:50.220
Ben and Amy got into the
same school in New York.

22:50.340 --> 22:51.165
So?

22:51.357 --> 22:53.761
Amy can go to school in New York
if that's what she wants to do.

22:53.937 --> 22:55.632
What? Where will you be?

22:55.626 --> 22:56.464
I don't know,

22:56.514 --> 22:57.966
but we'll figure it
out. We love each other.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.799
We really do, Adrian.

22:59.812 --> 23:00.782
Uh-huh.

23:01.651 --> 23:04.316
Well, that's a good thing, I guess,

23:04.360 --> 23:07.357
since the wedding is on hold, and

23:07.388 --> 23:09.584
you don't know when or where
you'll be getting married again.

23:09.616 --> 23:11.330
But we will be getting married.

23:11.612 --> 23:12.656
Again.

23:24.682 --> 23:25.751
More?

23:26.393 --> 23:29.005
Yeah, I need the extra energy.

23:29.296 --> 23:31.038
You got a big test coming up?

23:31.056 --> 23:31.932
No,

23:32.383 --> 23:34.704
I just need the energy to tell you about

23:34.704 --> 23:37.056
a little theory that's
percolating in my brain.

23:37.176 --> 23:38.132
Oh yeah?

23:38.483 --> 23:40.948
What's percolating in your brain?

23:41.308 --> 23:42.530
Well, here's the thing.

23:43.156 --> 23:44.326
Ricky said

23:44.389 --> 23:48.587
one too many times that he
and Amy really love each other.

23:48.624 --> 23:52.459
Is the entire theory going to be
based on this one lame premise?

23:52.486 --> 23:53.604
Not entirely,

23:53.648 --> 23:54.837
but it did make me think.

23:54.893 --> 23:56.582
And what I think is

23:56.795 --> 23:58.103
he's not in love with her.

23:58.278 --> 24:01.056
In fact, I don't think
they're married to each other.

24:01.118 --> 24:03.558
I can't find any public
record of any wedding

24:03.552 --> 24:05.210
between Ricky Underwood and Amy Juergens.

24:05.241 --> 24:06.667
I looked it up.

24:06.787 --> 24:09.351
I found a record for the
license, the marriage license.

24:09.369 --> 24:11.690
On the day they said they got
married, they got a license.

24:11.810 --> 24:13.273
I don't see a marriage recorded.

24:13.306 --> 24:14.681
Maybe that takes longer.

24:14.882 --> 24:16.446
Maybe whatever
fly-by-night place

24:16.458 --> 24:17.910
they went to hasn't done the paperwork,

24:17.954 --> 24:19.806
but they are married, so...

24:19.843 --> 24:21.414
So why were you looking it up?

24:21.448 --> 24:23.741
I don't know. I just looked it up.

24:23.861 --> 24:25.668
Yeah, okay. Here's how it is. T

24:25.931 --> 24:28.146
hose two have a license,
but they're not married.

24:28.622 --> 24:30.993
And I think Ricky is relieved
that the wedding is on hold.

24:30.999 --> 24:32.613
Wait, the wedding is on hold?

24:32.626 --> 24:34.508
Big argument going on with the parents.

24:34.527 --> 24:35.591
But anyway...

24:35.711 --> 24:37.249
I think Ricky's relieved

24:37.369 --> 24:39.188
and so Amy is probably relieved because

24:39.213 --> 24:41.090
now she gets to go to
school in New York with Ben

24:41.084 --> 24:43.768
and Ricky can stay here with you.

24:51.876 --> 24:54.704
Damn, I'm smart. Too smart.

24:57.013 --> 24:58.668
I just don't think that's the kind of girl

24:58.669 --> 24:59.921
she needs to be hanging out with.

25:00.220 --> 25:01.837
That girl knows things.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.045
It's not her fault that she knows things,

25:04.058 --> 25:04.959
but she knows things.

25:04.946 --> 25:06.416
And she'd be sharing
those things with Kathy.

25:06.441 --> 25:07.762
And Kathy shouldn't know those things.

25:07.793 --> 25:10.057
What kind of things exactly?

25:10.745 --> 25:13.399
You know, things you know
from having a lot of sex.

25:13.679 --> 25:15.944
You mean, things like

25:16.403 --> 25:19.911
men are creeps and will
have sex with teenage girls

25:19.954 --> 25:21.568
knowing it's illegal

25:21.587 --> 25:23.726
and the girl doesn't want
to have sex with them?

25:24.471 --> 25:26.348
Yeah. And other stuff.

25:26.404 --> 25:28.280
- What other stuff?
- You know,

25:28.315 --> 25:30.140
like how to get guys, and how to...

25:31.384 --> 25:32.761
Don't make me say it.

25:32.811 --> 25:34.719
No, I'm going to make you say it.

25:35.355 --> 25:36.222
Say it.

25:37.798 --> 25:39.119
Techniques.

25:39.239 --> 25:41.653
Okay now that you've said it,

25:41.773 --> 25:43.498
please, never say it again.

25:43.497 --> 25:44.912
Okay, but I'm thinking it.

25:45.100 --> 25:48.529
Chloe did not live in a sexy world.

25:48.791 --> 25:52.783
Her life was full of violence,
abuse and degradation.

25:53.273 --> 25:57.431
Chloe and other girls like
her are not taught techniques.

25:57.882 --> 26:01.497
They're taught how to survive, okay?

26:02.035 --> 26:03.223
And there's nothing wrong

26:03.224 --> 26:05.863
with these two young
women becoming friends.

26:06.319 --> 26:08.974
Chloe needs a friend. And so does Kathy.

26:09.356 --> 26:10.576
They've both been through a lot,

26:10.613 --> 26:12.841
and they're both new in school.

26:13.641 --> 26:15.894
And I like both of them. Very much.

26:16.607 --> 26:20.060
In fact, I think the real problem is

26:20.292 --> 26:21.787
you need a friend.

26:22.363 --> 26:24.265
- I have a friend.
- Who's your friend?

26:24.891 --> 26:26.104
I have lots of friends.

26:27.181 --> 26:28.338
Ben.

26:29.602 --> 26:30.328
Ricky.

26:30.358 --> 26:32.342
Ricky's not exactly a friend.

26:32.405 --> 26:33.493
He's more like family.

26:33.494 --> 26:35.873
Ricky and Amy are both our family.

26:36.997 --> 26:38.861
Did they tell you they're
not getting married?

26:38.981 --> 26:41.632
Amy's mom called off the wedding.
I heard it at school today.

26:42.155 --> 26:44.323
What? 

26:44.324 --> 26:47.821
You're sitting here
yammering on and on about

26:47.941 --> 26:52.057
things that do not concern
you when this concerns me?

26:52.177 --> 26:53.708
I just thought about it. Geez.

26:53.740 --> 26:55.492
You're hard to talk to, you know that?

27:01.091 --> 27:04.376
Boykewich International,
this is Nora speaking.

27:04.382 --> 27:05.446
How may I help you?

27:05.566 --> 27:06.966
Why are you speaking like that?

27:07.029 --> 27:09.250
I get tired of answering
the phone. What's up?

27:09.282 --> 27:11.622
What's up is I just heard

27:11.628 --> 27:14.537
that Anne has called off the wedding.

27:14.744 --> 27:16.458
Oh, I'm not surprised.

27:16.470 --> 27:17.334
I told you about Robie.

27:17.359 --> 27:19.230
Well what does Robie have to do

27:19.255 --> 27:21.563
with Amy and Ricky getting married?

27:21.601 --> 27:23.052
Anne told us she had

27:23.096 --> 27:25.630
everything done and there
was nothing left to do.

27:25.750 --> 27:28.014
Well, now it's undone, I guess.

27:28.020 --> 27:28.809
I don't even care anymore.

27:28.809 --> 27:31.856
As long as he's happy. And
I think Ricky's really happy.

27:31.976 --> 27:33.951
Well, I'm not.

27:38.805 --> 27:41.590
Okay, I've got to take off.

27:42.015 --> 27:44.874
Chloe has therapy this
afternoon so I'm driving her.

27:45.118 --> 27:47.083
And then she's meeting a friend for dinner,

27:47.120 --> 27:48.634
so I'm taking her over
to her friend's house.

27:48.678 --> 27:51.356
That's great, but you haven't given me back

27:51.368 --> 27:53.214
those reports you were supposed to sign.

27:54.096 --> 27:55.704
Where's Ben? Can't Ben do it?

27:55.729 --> 27:57.837
I don't want Ben to do it, I want to do it,

27:57.957 --> 27:59.689
and Ben better be at the butcher shop.

27:59.809 --> 28:02.167
He's been waltzing in and out
of there as if he owns the place.

28:02.202 --> 28:04.727
Sometimes I miss that butcher shop.

28:04.847 --> 28:06.153
I miss the meat.

28:06.848 --> 28:09.275
You know, the slicing and the pounding.

28:09.300 --> 28:10.727
You're not going anywhere.

28:11.534 --> 28:13.598
I'm just getting used
to you. I like you here.

28:13.917 --> 28:15.929
It's a new year, I'll give you a raise.

28:16.049 --> 28:18.250
I really, really miss that butcher shop.

28:18.284 --> 28:19.442
Don't push it.

28:19.629 --> 28:22.339
Just joking. Thank you so much.

28:22.351 --> 28:23.396
I'd love a raise.

28:23.390 --> 28:25.792
I'm saving up money to buy a car, you know.

28:26.517 --> 28:27.412
I know.

28:27.481 --> 28:29.352
And I know you know that I bought

28:29.358 --> 28:31.285
Henry and Alice cars for Christmas,

28:31.405 --> 28:33.067
but I've known them for a decade.

28:33.067 --> 28:34.612
I wasn't hinting around.

28:34.644 --> 28:37.672
Hey, you got a daughter
to take care of now.

28:37.853 --> 28:40.443
Yeah, and you know what? I like that girl.

28:41.107 --> 28:43.075
She's a kick in the pants.

28:43.109 --> 28:44.460
She's been to hell and back

28:44.528 --> 28:45.623
and she's still fighting.

28:45.636 --> 28:47.475
She's going to make
something of herself one day.

28:47.776 --> 28:48.940
Like you've done.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.999
So what are you thinking, like,

28:50.999 --> 28:53.126
maybe a hundred bucks a week? Or...

28:53.964 --> 28:55.078
We'll see.

29:07.566 --> 29:09.368
Hi, Nora. I was going to call you.

29:09.402 --> 29:11.020
Yeah, you better call me.

29:11.051 --> 29:12.985
And Margaret. Margaret's all fired up.

29:13.010 --> 29:15.400
It's just not a good time to
have a big family get-together.

29:15.520 --> 29:17.320
- For you.
- For any of us.

29:17.339 --> 29:19.923
Oh, come on, Anne. George
didn't mean any harm.

29:19.961 --> 29:21.218
Are you kidding me?

29:21.257 --> 29:22.558
Are you on his side?

29:22.558 --> 29:23.966
I'm just saying

29:23.959 --> 29:26.643
the man loves the boy
like he was his own son.

29:26.681 --> 29:27.644
Well he's not.

29:27.694 --> 29:29.508
I said was.

29:29.546 --> 29:31.154
Look, I have more bad news for you.

29:31.274 --> 29:32.230
Okay.

29:32.799 --> 29:34.131
I don't like bad news.

29:34.251 --> 29:36.978
I'm an alcoholic, so whatever
it is, put a good spin on it.

29:37.009 --> 29:39.599
For one thing, you're going to
be getting a new place to live

29:39.624 --> 29:41.013
because I'm evicting George.

29:41.133 --> 29:42.358
And for another thing,

29:42.427 --> 29:44.066
if you weren't all that
happy about Amy and Ricky

29:44.066 --> 29:46.519
being married, that's
great, because they're not.

29:59.588 --> 30:01.602
Why 49 poeple? Why not 50?

30:01.722 --> 30:03.355
I don't really know.

30:03.348 --> 30:04.706
Because...

30:04.826 --> 30:06.339
Anne likes odd numbers.

30:06.459 --> 30:07.659
Anne is an odd number.

30:07.903 --> 30:09.961
- I don't know what that means.
- I don't know either,

30:10.133 --> 30:12.475
but she likes odd people,
like that freak, David.

30:12.488 --> 30:13.689
Okay.

30:14.064 --> 30:15.910
I want all your plans. I
want everything you have.

30:16.755 --> 30:19.020
George, Anne has everything.
I don't have everything.

30:19.089 --> 30:20.409
Then recreate everything.

30:20.447 --> 30:22.724
I don't think I can do that, George.

30:22.736 --> 30:23.881
Fine. We'll start fresh.

30:23.888 --> 30:25.033
We'll come up with a brand-new wedding.

30:25.070 --> 30:28.348
Oh, I really do not want to
get in the middle of this.

30:28.399 --> 30:29.612
You're not in the middle of this.

30:29.612 --> 30:30.838
You're on my side. You know why?

30:30.838 --> 30:32.571
Because you work for me.
You don't work for Anne.

30:32.577 --> 30:36.081
Uh, don't forget you made
me a partner. We're partners.

30:36.826 --> 30:38.590
Oh. I did forget.

30:38.615 --> 30:39.897
And I work with Anne,

30:40.017 --> 30:42.043
and we do a lot of business with Anne,

30:42.062 --> 30:44.634
so I'm hoping the two of
you will get past this,

30:44.896 --> 30:46.742
and not just for business sake.

30:46.780 --> 30:48.156
For Robie's sake.

30:48.200 --> 30:49.426
Don't tell me that. Tell Anne that.

30:49.420 --> 30:50.453
I haven't done anything wrong.

30:50.427 --> 30:52.518
I've done the right thing for
Robie every step of the way.

30:52.555 --> 30:55.596
Uh, okay. I know you think you have.

30:55.633 --> 30:58.155
But you're not Robie's daddy

30:58.173 --> 31:01.089
and Anne is not happy that
you let her think you were.

31:01.302 --> 31:04.486
And she doesn't want to see
you at Amy and Ricky's wedding,

31:04.499 --> 31:07.045
so there is no wedding for the time being.

31:07.102 --> 31:09.353
Robie's just going to grow up
to be a nerd if those two idiots

31:09.397 --> 31:11.499
don't let me provide the
male influence in his life.

31:11.619 --> 31:13.489
This can't be good.

31:15.441 --> 31:16.617
I'm taking over the wedding.

31:16.605 --> 31:19.326
Are you thinking it'll still
be in the backyard here?

31:19.332 --> 31:20.164
Yes.

31:20.221 --> 31:21.628
Okay. I'm just gonna

31:21.622 --> 31:23.292
grab some bread and eat it in my room.

31:23.317 --> 31:25.476
And I'll take a roll to go. I'm starving.

31:27.572 --> 31:29.912
Good to see you, Nora. Bye now.

31:33.779 --> 31:35.643
He can come to the wedding. Anne can't.

31:35.631 --> 31:36.569
Oh, George,

31:36.689 --> 31:38.058
why don't you give Anne a call

31:38.089 --> 31:39.547
and just see if you two can't work it out?

31:39.572 --> 31:42.437
I mean, you don't want a bad
relationship with your ex, do you?

31:42.687 --> 31:44.796
I mean, Anne owns the house.

31:44.783 --> 31:45.903
What does that mean?

31:46.316 --> 31:48.650
It means your life and Anne's life,

31:48.669 --> 31:49.920
are entangled in all sorts of ways

31:49.952 --> 31:51.354
and you two should be friends.

31:51.385 --> 31:52.598
We've tried being friends.

31:52.629 --> 31:54.562
This is war. This is an all-out war.

31:54.619 --> 31:56.189
Well, if you lose, you could lose big.

31:56.202 --> 31:57.109
I'm not going to lose.

31:57.109 --> 31:58.431
And I'm gonna continue to see Robie

31:58.432 --> 31:59.432
whether she likes it or not.

31:59.349 --> 32:00.663
Whether David likes it or not.

32:00.650 --> 32:02.102
I didn't do anything wrong.

32:02.158 --> 32:05.037
Well, there are all
different levels of wrong.

32:05.049 --> 32:05.869
There are misdemeanors,

32:05.900 --> 32:06.838
and then there are felonies,

32:06.876 --> 32:08.515
and then there are just big stupid mistakes

32:08.509 --> 32:10.217
and everything in between...

32:12.232 --> 32:13.515
I have to talk to you.

32:13.635 --> 32:14.735
- Me?
- Me?

32:14.855 --> 32:15.661
Both of you.

32:15.686 --> 32:17.438
I know you both love Anne, and...

32:17.456 --> 32:19.214
Not both of us. I don't.

32:19.452 --> 32:21.585
Your little gal pal is trying
to call off my Amy's wedding.

32:21.585 --> 32:23.168
And you know what? She can't do that.

32:23.211 --> 32:24.512
There's gonna be a wedding.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.615
There has to be a wedding. You know why?

32:26.658 --> 32:28.060
- I think I do.
- Anne told you?

32:28.104 --> 32:29.431
- Yeah.
- Good.

32:32.823 --> 32:33.912
Can't tell you.

32:36.169 --> 32:38.354
Oh, my God, this is delicious.

32:38.536 --> 32:39.906
I wish my grandma had stuck around

32:39.919 --> 32:41.427
so she could see how
much you love the food.

32:41.458 --> 32:42.772
Why didn't she stick around?

32:43.135 --> 32:45.443
She just thought that maybe
we'd like to eat by ourselves.

32:45.694 --> 32:47.739
She's just watching TV in her bedroom.

32:48.146 --> 32:50.680
She's eating in bed,
but she likes to do that.

32:51.174 --> 32:53.251
Sometimes, we both eat
in her bed and watch TV.

32:53.288 --> 32:54.252
Is that weird?

32:54.372 --> 32:56.060
That's not weird. That's sweet.

32:56.598 --> 32:58.256
I wish I had a grandma.

32:58.562 --> 33:01.196
Then again, I'm lucky
to have a foster family.

33:01.471 --> 33:03.605
I can't believe I have a foster family.

33:03.725 --> 33:07.021
And that my foster dad is Leo Boykewich.

33:07.203 --> 33:09.699
Man, he could really
kick my stepfather's ass.

33:10.143 --> 33:11.282
Would you like him to?

33:11.294 --> 33:13.578
Oh, yeah, I'd love for him to.

33:14.185 --> 33:16.756
My stepfather completely
brainwashed my mother.

33:16.794 --> 33:19.753
He kept telling her I was being
beaten up at school by a bully

33:19.759 --> 33:21.974
and that he was trying to
teach me to defend myself.

33:22.349 --> 33:24.495
Meanwhile, he was just at home

33:24.545 --> 33:26.641
drinking and smacking me around.

33:26.998 --> 33:28.668
I was hoping he had left, but

33:28.712 --> 33:30.602
no, she's still married to him.

33:30.608 --> 33:31.678
What an idiot.

33:32.091 --> 33:33.693
Does he smack her around too?

33:33.711 --> 33:34.717
I don't think so.

33:34.837 --> 33:36.552
He's a really big coward.

33:36.602 --> 33:37.923
I think he just goes after children.

33:37.991 --> 33:39.599
Well, that must have been terrible for you.

33:39.656 --> 33:41.501
Yeah, I thought it was.

33:41.908 --> 33:44.598
Until I left home and saw how
terrible things can really get.

33:45.061 --> 33:46.331
I can't even imagine.

33:46.375 --> 33:48.095
We shouldn't talk about that stuff.

33:49.115 --> 33:52.400
It's not something to
talk about over dinner.

33:53.201 --> 33:55.341
I don't think I'd really even
want to tell you that stuff.

33:56.004 --> 33:57.612
My therapist, maybe.

33:58.144 --> 33:59.965
It's just so dark.

34:00.497 --> 34:02.342
Let's just talk about happy things.

34:02.462 --> 34:03.825
- Like...
- Like...

34:03.945 --> 34:05.501
allowing my baby to be adopted?

34:05.483 --> 34:09.174
- Is that a happy thing?
- Well, it's a bittersweet thing.

34:10.657 --> 34:12.045
So, you go to therapy, huh?

34:12.114 --> 34:14.498
Yeah. I'm really glad
somebody invented that.

34:15.399 --> 34:18.101
I just keep shoveling all
this stuff out of my head,

34:18.295 --> 34:20.348
and shoveling and shoveling.

34:21.016 --> 34:23.451
And sometimes it feels
like I'm never going to get

34:23.445 --> 34:24.757
to the light at the end of the tunnel,

34:24.777 --> 34:25.871
but every once in a while,

34:25.916 --> 34:27.793
there's this little glimmer of light,

34:27.967 --> 34:30.846
this little hope that somehow, someday,

34:30.871 --> 34:32.773
I'll feel like a normal person, you know?

34:32.973 --> 34:34.335
What do you feel like now?

34:34.456 --> 34:36.001
I feel...

34:36.121 --> 34:38.003
afraid to be happy.

34:38.472 --> 34:39.598
Because I'm scared.

34:39.659 --> 34:40.911
I'm scared that he'll show up

34:40.929 --> 34:43.283
and take whatever happiness I have.

34:44.234 --> 34:45.748
He was a really scary guy.

34:46.016 --> 34:47.712
How do you ever get
past something like that?

34:47.906 --> 34:48.969
Hopefully,

34:49.214 --> 34:50.728
you make a friend that you can talk to,

34:50.759 --> 34:51.935
and you just keep...

34:52.386 --> 34:53.536
shoveling.

35:01.314 --> 35:04.079
So, now my mother knows we're not married.

35:04.136 --> 35:06.013
And now Nora knows we're not married.

35:06.388 --> 35:08.178
Two down and one to go.

35:08.403 --> 35:09.460
Yeah.

35:09.679 --> 35:10.899
What are we going to do?

35:11.456 --> 35:13.101
Whatever we want to do.

35:13.589 --> 35:15.003
Do you know what you want to do?

35:15.041 --> 35:17.499
I know what I want to do.

35:29.155 --> 35:30.851
I didn't know she was kicking him out.

35:31.245 --> 35:33.428
Yeah, well, she kicks him out,

35:33.447 --> 35:34.561
I'm gonna have to go, too, you know.

35:34.605 --> 35:36.625
- Yeah, I realize that.
- Yeah.

35:36.823 --> 35:38.095
So...

35:39.366 --> 35:41.480
You have to talk to her. Okay?

35:41.505 --> 35:43.689
You have to get her to
calm down about Robie.

35:43.863 --> 35:45.685
Yeah, it's a bad thing George did,

35:45.703 --> 35:47.104
but not in George's world.

35:47.286 --> 35:48.618
He thinks he did a good thing

35:48.662 --> 35:50.289
and he loves Robie.

35:51.277 --> 35:54.042
And she has to have this wedding,

35:54.074 --> 35:56.257
especially now that she knows
those two aren't really married.

35:56.377 --> 35:57.972
You've got to talk to her.

35:57.978 --> 35:59.974
You're the only one who can talk to her.

36:00.012 --> 36:02.164
I don't really want to talk to her.

36:03.703 --> 36:05.237
What do you mean, you
don't want to talk to her?

36:05.305 --> 36:07.339
You guys are in love, you're a couple.

36:07.383 --> 36:09.673
Mmm, no. We're not a couple.

36:09.723 --> 36:12.169
And I'm not so in love anymore.

36:13.351 --> 36:16.555
No! You cannot break up with Anne!

36:16.561 --> 36:18.082
Not now. You can't!

36:18.202 --> 36:20.491
It's just too much.

36:20.503 --> 36:22.956
I don't really want to
be in a relationship.

36:23.319 --> 36:25.990
No. You are in a relationship.

36:26.022 --> 36:27.572
I can't stand that drive.

36:27.607 --> 36:29.581
Palm Springs is two hours away.

36:29.575 --> 36:31.427
With traffic, it can be six hours away.

36:31.452 --> 36:32.465
It's too far.

36:32.502 --> 36:34.805
Okay. And when I get
there, it's Anne and Robie.

36:34.847 --> 36:36.206
I don't have children.

36:36.225 --> 36:37.620
I don't really want children.

36:37.614 --> 36:39.116
Especially little children.

36:39.147 --> 36:40.899
They come with so much stuff.

36:41.019 --> 36:43.164
The diapers and the bottles

36:43.183 --> 36:44.353
and the baby food

36:44.378 --> 36:46.586
and all the equipment and all the toys.

36:46.605 --> 36:49.089
It's just... Ugh! It's too much.

36:49.562 --> 36:51.679
It is not too much.

36:51.698 --> 36:52.797
It's too much for me.

36:53.205 --> 36:54.826
You knew what you were getting into.

36:54.895 --> 36:56.210
Mmm. Not really.

36:56.211 --> 36:58.651
I've never been in love
with someone like Anne.

36:58.738 --> 37:00.318
You've never been in love.

37:00.881 --> 37:03.171
So, let me tell you
something, love conquers all.

37:03.196 --> 37:05.677
So, you just get back there and conquer!

37:06.150 --> 37:09.447
Mmm, it's not really love. It's like.

37:09.897 --> 37:11.793
And like doesn't really conquer anything.

37:15.721 --> 37:17.361
My question is

37:17.562 --> 37:19.532
why do you have a theory
about Amy and Ricky?

37:19.551 --> 37:20.996
Why do you care?

37:21.661 --> 37:24.136
I don't care if they get married or not.

37:24.393 --> 37:27.090
I am not in love with Ricky.
I don't care about him.

37:27.152 --> 37:29.718
You sure? I am absolutely positive.

37:29.735 --> 37:32.302
Well for someone who doesn't
care, you seem awfully happy

37:32.302 --> 37:33.705
about Ricky not being married.

37:33.739 --> 37:36.444
No, I'm just happy I figured it out.

37:36.809 --> 37:39.415
So, if I said right now let's...

37:39.872 --> 37:41.924
get out of bed, go to
Vegas and get married,

37:42.044 --> 37:43.162
you would say what?

37:43.725 --> 37:45.183
I have school tomorrow.

37:45.202 --> 37:47.016
Uh-huh, otherwise?

37:47.136 --> 37:48.874
Otherwise, I'd...

37:49.249 --> 37:51.007
still want to wait because I want to be

37:51.013 --> 37:53.690
at least halfway through
college before we get married.

37:53.810 --> 37:55.236
Well, that's new

37:55.286 --> 37:58.089
and that's two years earlier
than your previous plan.

37:58.421 --> 38:00.185
- You like it?
- I love it.

38:00.533 --> 38:02.150
So, when are we going to tell your parents?

38:02.169 --> 38:03.908
We still haven't even shown them your ring.

38:04.283 --> 38:06.874
Uh, we'll wait.

38:07.162 --> 38:09.620
'Cause they're not going to
like it, especially my dad.

38:09.642 --> 38:12.304
Well, you don't not tell people
something that's important

38:12.298 --> 38:14.212
just because they might not
like it or not want to hear it.

38:14.256 --> 38:15.520
You've met my dad.

38:15.739 --> 38:17.835
Yeah. I have. He likes me.

38:17.898 --> 38:19.199
He's not going to like you as much

38:19.205 --> 38:21.601
if he thinks you're going to
interfere with my getting an education.

38:21.621 --> 38:24.437
I'm not going to interfere with
that. I'm going to encourage that.

38:24.404 --> 38:25.762
Oh, really?

38:25.882 --> 38:28.252
'Cause you didn't exactly
encourage me to study tonight.

38:28.296 --> 38:30.843
I was just trying to get you
to shut up about Ricky and Amy.

38:31.112 --> 38:32.670
I love you.

38:32.932 --> 38:35.004
I love you, too.

38:41.607 --> 38:43.349
Oh, hey. There you are.

38:43.469 --> 38:46.165
And look, God made your cast smaller.

38:46.612 --> 38:48.900
It was a compromise. How are you?

38:49.020 --> 38:51.377
- I'm good. How are you?
- Fine.

38:51.402 --> 38:52.472
Yeah?

38:52.503 --> 38:54.011
Grace, every night, you ask me this

38:54.055 --> 38:55.718
and every night I tell you I'm fine.

38:55.838 --> 38:56.889
I'm fantastic.

38:56.939 --> 38:59.743
Yeah, and you know, every
day Chloe asks me about you,

38:59.774 --> 39:01.351
and I tell her you're fantastic.

39:01.560 --> 39:03.009
Why is Chloe asking about me?

39:03.129 --> 39:03.653
I don't know.

39:03.666 --> 39:05.380
I think maybe she feels
a little guilty that

39:05.412 --> 39:07.432
maybe this happened because of her,

39:07.664 --> 39:09.078
so she just wants to know that you're okay.

39:09.115 --> 39:10.579
Does she know I'm staying over here?

39:10.569 --> 39:12.187
Everyone knows you're here.

39:12.307 --> 39:13.675
Everyone knows you've been staying here

39:13.676 --> 39:14.827
since you got home from the hospital.

39:14.874 --> 39:17.667
I didn't realize. I don't really
want people knowing where I am.

39:17.711 --> 39:19.319
- Why's that?
- I just don't.

39:20.780 --> 39:23.674
- Jack, come on, you're not okay.
- No. I am.

39:23.683 --> 39:25.300
Why do you refuse to talk to Dr. Chan

39:25.313 --> 39:26.752
or to anyone else about
what happened to you?

39:26.771 --> 39:28.535
Because I don't even
remember what happened to me.

39:28.586 --> 39:29.574
I'd rather not remember.

39:29.562 --> 39:31.539
I'm okay with not remembering.

39:31.891 --> 39:33.284
I don't want to think about it,

39:33.278 --> 39:34.611
so leave me alone about it.

39:34.611 --> 39:36.275
- You and everyone else.
- All right.

39:36.306 --> 39:37.476
I'm sorry.

39:40.011 --> 39:42.901
You know, maybe we just need to
spend a night away from each other.

39:43.326 --> 39:45.028
Or maybe we don't.

39:45.403 --> 39:46.829
I'm sorry Grace.

39:46.892 --> 39:48.412
I'm sorry I snapped at you.

39:48.808 --> 39:50.195
I love you.

39:50.784 --> 39:52.679
I want to spend the
rest of my life with you.

40:10.863 --> 40:13.652
What's going on? Is everything all right?

40:13.665 --> 40:14.584
Are you okay?

40:15.648 --> 40:16.799
I'm okay.

40:17.703 --> 40:19.746
But you're not going to be
okay when I tell you this.

40:19.796 --> 40:21.104
When you tell us what?

40:21.129 --> 40:23.369
Just spit it out. It's late.
I've got to get up early.

40:24.677 --> 40:26.410
Amy and I aren't really married.

40:40.293 --> 40:42.846
As I was about to say
when we were interrupted,

40:42.840 --> 40:44.298
you and I are getting evicted.

40:44.298 --> 40:47.113
And nothing you do with Kathleen
is gonna make that go away.

40:53.289 --> 40:54.915
I need a miracle.

41:01.767 --> 41:03.375
Coming this spring,

41:03.381 --> 41:05.165
to all new Mondays,

41:05.171 --> 41:07.304
the show that moved a nation,

41:07.310 --> 41:09.150
is saying goodbye.

41:11.577 --> 41:13.605
She's kinda cute. Who is that?

41:16.934 --> 41:19.424
You can't be having a
baby at fifteen years old.

41:22.571 --> 41:24.229
Your son's gonna need you.

41:24.235 --> 41:25.637
Daddy's here.

41:29.135 --> 41:30.524
Amy Juergens...

41:30.580 --> 41:32.420
will you marry me?

41:38.871 --> 41:41.849
If I don't go now, I may
never have that chance again.

41:42.205 --> 41:44.564
I know you're not in love with him.

41:47.686 --> 41:49.012
This is it Amy.

41:49.434 --> 41:50.767
Are you in or are you out?

41:51.631 --> 41:54.515
Look for the Spring premiere of Secret Life

41:54.635 --> 41:55.966
Together Forever.

41:56.005 --> 41:58.676
Monday, March 18, at 8/7 central.

41:58.701 --> 42:00.847
Only on ABC Family.
