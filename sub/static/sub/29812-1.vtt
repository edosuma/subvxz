00:39.997 --> 00:42.368
<i>This is me. Yeah, really.</i>

00:43.634 --> 00:46.001
<i>I was so little.</i>

00:46.003 --> 00:48.037
<i>We were all little once, right?</i>

01:00.384 --> 01:03.856
<i>This tiny apartment is my home.</i>

01:05.423 --> 01:08.060
<i>When I was little,
I never went out.</i>

01:10.095 --> 01:13.363
<i>So, naturally,
I was curious about the world.</i>

01:13.365 --> 01:16.035
<i>Very curious.</i>

01:21.972 --> 01:26.809
Boss, there's still no sign
of a cat or a necklace.

01:38.122 --> 01:42.660
<i>He told me that out there
was this great place.</i>

03:12.384 --> 03:14.520
Oh!

03:16.788 --> 03:18.687
Where did you go?

03:18.689 --> 03:22.026
What happened to you? Blanket...

03:35.206 --> 03:38.944
<i>After that,
I never left home again.</i>

04:02.232 --> 04:05.567
- Daddy.
- Hmm?

04:05.569 --> 04:08.204
Daddy!

04:08.206 --> 04:10.875
- Daddy!
- Argh!

04:28.359 --> 04:30.258
Hah!

04:43.541 --> 04:45.476
Huh?

04:58.890 --> 05:02.724
Daddy, the city -
what's it like?

05:06.029 --> 05:10.665
Cape, I've told you
many, many, many times about it.

05:10.667 --> 05:12.400
Out there, it's chaotic,

05:12.402 --> 05:15.671
it's cold
and also full of crooks.

05:15.673 --> 05:18.174
It's not exactly
what you think it is.

05:18.176 --> 05:21.611
But I want to go!
I've never been outside.

05:21.613 --> 05:25.681
When you grow up,
my son, you will understand.

05:25.683 --> 05:28.184
This is such a nice home.

05:28.186 --> 05:30.585
We lack only the things
we don't need.

05:30.587 --> 05:33.124
You should be content,
just like I am.

05:35.193 --> 05:37.128
I don't want to be like you.

05:38.296 --> 05:41.463
- Huh?
- Blanket! Cape!

05:41.465 --> 05:43.332
Look, meet your new pal!

05:50.541 --> 05:52.344
Come down here! Oh!

06:04.388 --> 06:06.222
She's a blue-and-gold macaw.

06:06.224 --> 06:08.327
Her perch
is still downstairs.

06:10.460 --> 06:14.162
- Hi. What's your name?
- Macaw.

06:14.164 --> 06:17.333
Yes, I know you're a macaw,
but what's your name?

06:17.335 --> 06:20.302
- I'm Mack.
- Mack, here's your perch. Come.

06:20.304 --> 06:23.071
Whoa.

06:23.073 --> 06:25.340
Uh?

06:25.342 --> 06:27.612
I have your seeds
and nuts.

06:28.779 --> 06:31.080
You're really named Mack?

06:31.082 --> 06:33.982
- Yeah.
- Huh? But you're a female.

06:33.984 --> 06:36.751
Why is your name Mack?
It's such a macho name.

06:36.753 --> 06:39.655
What can I do about it?
This is my sixth home already.

06:39.657 --> 06:42.592
New home, new name. Who can
possibly keep track of it all?

06:44.495 --> 06:47.530
In the end, I suppose that Mack
was just easier for everyone.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.332
Have you been to lots of places?

06:49.334 --> 06:52.133
Of course, little buddy.
Of course.

06:52.135 --> 06:54.970
Although, I have
a small character flaw.

06:54.972 --> 06:58.941
I can't resist... biting things.

06:58.943 --> 07:00.710
I'm a tad destructive.

07:00.712 --> 07:02.510
It's a tiny character flaw,

07:02.512 --> 07:04.713
but humans can't seem
to cope with it.

07:04.715 --> 07:06.816
You've been in so many homes.

07:06.818 --> 07:09.520
- So, you've been outside too?
- Huh?

07:13.157 --> 07:16.758
- Why are you so interested?
- Being home all day is boring.

07:16.760 --> 07:18.794
I see.

07:18.796 --> 07:23.131
Water! Water! Aah! Ah-ha-ha!

07:23.133 --> 07:25.100
If you're so scared of soda,

07:25.102 --> 07:27.770
I bet bath time must leave you
a total wreck, doesn't it?

07:27.772 --> 07:30.108
You...

07:32.277 --> 07:34.443
Hey, Fatty. Hey, Fatty!

07:34.445 --> 07:36.778
It's rude to keep your door open
while on the toilet

07:36.780 --> 07:39.248
with a lady around, understand?

07:39.250 --> 07:41.650
- Ugh!
- Aunty Mack?

07:41.652 --> 07:45.621
Outside? I don't know.
I haven't been.

07:45.623 --> 07:47.356
- Well, I have.
- You?

07:47.358 --> 07:49.924
A fat and lazy cat?

07:49.926 --> 07:54.030
A fat cat who can barely
fit on the toilet. You?

07:54.032 --> 07:56.665
So, what's out there?
Tell us.

07:56.667 --> 07:59.602
Tell us. Come on. Tell us!

07:59.604 --> 08:01.304
- Peachtopia.
- Huh?

08:01.306 --> 08:03.205
Peachtopia?

08:03.207 --> 08:06.142
A peach tree forest
along the stream.

08:06.144 --> 08:09.044
That's right. Hmm!

08:09.046 --> 08:12.114
I've been told by many cats
about that legendary place.

08:12.116 --> 08:15.551
A real Peachtopia.
It's a place for cats.

08:15.553 --> 08:17.787
You don't know about it?

08:17.789 --> 08:19.587
Five, six, seven, eight.

08:25.229 --> 08:27.662
♪ Peachtopia is a place

08:27.664 --> 08:32.068

09:56.920 --> 09:58.653
Huh?

09:58.655 --> 10:00.455
You made that up, Fatty.

10:00.457 --> 10:02.758
I swear it's on that mountain.

10:02.760 --> 10:04.859
This glass bead leads directly
to Peachtopia.

10:04.861 --> 10:06.762
This thing?

10:14.704 --> 10:18.742
You think I'm an idiot?
A feline Peachtopia?!

10:19.774 --> 10:21.343
If there's a cat Shakespeare...

10:21.345 --> 10:24.616
..I'm a parrot Jane Austen.

10:39.463 --> 10:41.400
Something on
your mind, Blanket?

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
You once told me that,
when you were little,

10:46.002 --> 10:48.839
a stray cat came around here.

10:51.675 --> 10:53.978
Dad, he was
from Peachtopia, right?

10:57.582 --> 11:00.316
Daddy, where did Mommy go?

11:00.318 --> 11:04.420
Could she be... in Peachtopia?

11:04.422 --> 11:10.392
Maybe she's waiting over there
by a peach tree.

11:10.394 --> 11:12.998
Daddy, I want to go out.

11:29.713 --> 11:32.784
Hey, what are you doing?

11:35.986 --> 11:38.789
Huh?

11:50.668 --> 11:52.404
Hmm.

12:05.415 --> 12:07.585
Huh?

12:30.274 --> 12:32.206
- Phew!
- You scared me! You scared me!

12:32.208 --> 12:35.543
- That was so reckless.
- Cape, cats aren't birds.

12:35.545 --> 12:38.113
Cats can't fly.
Your mother, she...

12:38.115 --> 12:40.784
Well, she, uh...

12:43.154 --> 12:46.055
What about my mom? Where is she?

12:46.057 --> 12:50.526
Your mom,
she... went to Peachtopia.

12:50.528 --> 12:53.195
Really?
My mom went to Peachtopia?!

12:53.197 --> 12:55.133
Hey, let's go find her!

12:57.901 --> 13:02.171
It's too far away.
We'll never make it.

13:02.173 --> 13:05.376
Why is that?

13:07.211 --> 13:11.479
Cape, cats aren't birds.
Cats can't fly.

13:11.481 --> 13:13.983
Fly?

13:13.985 --> 13:15.917
Huh?

13:27.765 --> 13:30.869
Ah!

13:36.273 --> 13:41.476
One, two, three!

13:43.146 --> 13:46.648
Oh! Ah!

13:46.650 --> 13:48.883
Oh!

13:48.885 --> 13:52.354
Hey, Cape, let's say
you do make it down.

13:52.356 --> 13:54.058
There's still the river
to cross.

13:56.894 --> 14:00.561
<i>..everywhere and
in your home, in your cosy home,</i>

14:00.563 --> 14:04.199
<i>and in your cosy kitchen,
there's danger!</i>

14:04.201 --> 14:06.567
- <i>Take this...</i>
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

14:06.569 --> 14:09.838
My goodness! Oh!
That's so scary! So shocking!

14:09.840 --> 14:13.474
A lifetime of scares under our
own roof! It's unbelievable!

14:13.476 --> 14:16.612
You see? You see? It's even
dangerous at home, you guys.

14:16.614 --> 14:18.647
<i>Come on. Come on.
Give me a warship!</i>

14:38.269 --> 14:39.971
Uh...

14:51.448 --> 14:54.282
Cape, to be young
is to struggle,

14:54.284 --> 14:55.950
but there's no point.

14:57.788 --> 15:00.659
Hey, Cape?

15:02.525 --> 15:04.292
What are you doing?

15:04.294 --> 15:06.394
Daddy, look, I made a rocket!

15:06.396 --> 15:09.364
I'm going to fly it out of here.

15:11.836 --> 15:14.202
Huh?

15:14.204 --> 15:17.940
Cape, get down! Aargh!

15:17.942 --> 15:21.944
Daddy, I'm going to Peachtopia!
Look! Watch me fly!

15:25.949 --> 15:29.020
Cape! Cape!

15:37.127 --> 15:39.595
- Aah!
- He's really flying!

15:55.779 --> 15:59.013
Aah! Cape! He's falling!

16:06.122 --> 16:08.459
Yeah!

16:28.611 --> 16:30.778
Aah!

16:42.193 --> 16:44.292
We have to save him!

16:49.098 --> 16:51.502
Oh! Oh! Oh!

17:20.396 --> 17:22.599
Cape!

17:29.340 --> 17:31.109
Hey!

17:37.247 --> 17:40.081
Huh?

17:48.191 --> 17:50.260
Cape!

17:59.370 --> 18:02.640
The red speck, I can't see it.
Oh, Cape.

18:11.047 --> 18:14.882
Huh?

18:14.884 --> 18:16.551
- What's that?
- Looks like a cat.

18:16.553 --> 18:18.153
- Really?
- There's a cat on it!

18:18.155 --> 18:20.091
Oh!

18:44.848 --> 18:46.584
Ah!

18:48.518 --> 18:50.287
Ah!

18:57.628 --> 19:00.128
Whoa.

19:03.667 --> 19:06.971
Yeah! Oh!

19:17.046 --> 19:18.783
Huh?

19:27.957 --> 19:29.791
Daddy, Daddy! Look!

19:29.793 --> 19:31.626
I just photographed
a paraglider.

19:31.628 --> 19:33.494
- Uh-huh. I see.
- Come on.

19:33.496 --> 19:35.763
- Look again.
- Sure, sure.

19:35.765 --> 19:38.433
It flew and flew, flew
and flew, all the way to here.

19:38.435 --> 19:40.635
Oh. Great photo.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.771
She... she saw where Cape landed!

19:42.773 --> 19:45.310
Hurry up! Quick!

19:49.412 --> 19:51.946
You can do it, Fatty!

19:51.948 --> 19:54.282
You having a baby or what, huh?
Just do it!

19:54.284 --> 19:56.283
Come on!

19:56.285 --> 19:58.422
Push!

19:59.656 --> 20:02.957
That's it! Good.
Head's out! Whoa!

20:02.959 --> 20:04.928
Hurry. Go on.

20:47.236 --> 20:49.006
Oh!

21:02.151 --> 21:04.855
Hey! Hey!

21:07.190 --> 21:09.925
Excuse me?

21:09.927 --> 21:11.661
Shh!

21:21.772 --> 21:23.972
Who are you?
How did you get here?

21:23.974 --> 21:26.340
Well, actually,
I want to go there,

21:26.342 --> 21:29.343
to the mountain there,
to Peachtopia.

21:29.345 --> 21:32.280
Peachtopia? Never heard of it.

21:32.282 --> 21:35.520
But it's dangerous here.
Easy to get in, hard to get out.

21:40.791 --> 21:42.493
Huh?

21:46.196 --> 21:49.697
He got in by accident.
Let him go.

21:49.699 --> 21:51.699
Run, little cat!

21:57.740 --> 22:00.175
No!

22:00.177 --> 22:03.177
No! No!

22:10.720 --> 22:14.022
- These are his early works.
- Yeah, we love those.

22:14.024 --> 22:16.323
My wife and I collect them.
Do you have any new ones?

22:16.325 --> 22:18.129
Huh?

22:21.698 --> 22:23.434
Aah!

22:28.138 --> 22:30.608
Hey! Whoa!

22:33.043 --> 22:34.809
Stop!

22:42.319 --> 22:44.688
Ow!

22:54.363 --> 22:56.564
Yes, the new ones.

22:56.566 --> 22:59.301
Yeah, they didn't
really have them.

22:59.303 --> 23:01.669
No.

23:04.006 --> 23:06.843
Get down! Now!

23:15.919 --> 23:17.688
Huh?

23:19.488 --> 23:21.822
No, he's stuck.

23:21.824 --> 23:24.158
Round and round he goes,

23:24.160 --> 23:26.026
but then no, nothing.

23:26.028 --> 23:28.096
- Look.
- Too complicated.

23:28.098 --> 23:30.698
No, no, that's it!

23:30.700 --> 23:33.368
- It's way too complicated.
- Huh?

23:33.370 --> 23:37.171
He's searching
for a breakthrough.

23:37.173 --> 23:40.007
Artists struggle, get stuck,

23:40.009 --> 23:42.843
and then bang, they amaze us.

23:42.845 --> 23:44.713
Sure, if there's a bang.

23:44.715 --> 23:46.449
Huh?

23:54.624 --> 23:56.993
Huh?

24:27.524 --> 24:29.126
- Search over here.
- Huh?

24:39.703 --> 24:41.535
Huh?

24:41.537 --> 24:43.207
Hey.

24:44.675 --> 24:46.611
- Hey.
- Huh?

24:49.111 --> 24:51.980
- Huh?
- There's cameras everywhere.

24:51.982 --> 24:55.382
Follow my footsteps.

25:12.335 --> 25:15.171
Hmm!

25:19.176 --> 25:21.012
- Over there! Get him!
- Huh?

25:26.582 --> 25:28.451
There!
Over there! Quick!

25:36.626 --> 25:39.194
He, boss,
we checked the whole factory.

25:39.196 --> 25:41.529
And we locked up the ape.

25:41.531 --> 25:43.697
- Just go now.
- Sure.

25:43.699 --> 25:46.533
All my work, my inspiration,

25:46.535 --> 25:49.870
even this workshop
began with that bead.

25:49.872 --> 25:52.639
And after all this time,
it's finally back!

25:55.144 --> 26:00.314
Lately, sales have been
way, way down.

26:00.316 --> 26:04.551
That work,
even old customers dislike it.

26:04.553 --> 26:07.190
As you know,
the market prefers the early...

26:08.992 --> 26:11.192
What's wrong with the new work?

26:11.194 --> 26:13.962
What's wrong with it?
What do they know, huh?

26:13.964 --> 26:17.432
Maybe... maybe it's because
they're too complicated?

26:17.434 --> 26:19.234
What's that even mean?

26:19.236 --> 26:21.069
What do you mean,
"too complicated"?

26:21.071 --> 26:24.505
Which bit is too much?
Tell me! Which bit? Tell me!

26:24.507 --> 26:27.742
You're the boss
and you create the work.

26:27.744 --> 26:30.244
I'm the manager,
I look after sales.

26:30.246 --> 26:34.081
The market's tough now.
Sales are really bad.

26:34.083 --> 26:36.687
If nothing changes,
this workshop...

26:42.124 --> 26:44.961
We'll look all over the place
for that necklace.

27:01.544 --> 27:04.178
What now? How can we see
that photo? Huh?

27:04.180 --> 27:07.215
Wow! Daddy, look!
The river's so wide!

27:07.217 --> 27:09.016
- It's so pretty!
- Leave it to me.

27:12.488 --> 27:14.488
Let's see the paraglider photo.

27:14.490 --> 27:16.724
Paraglider? OK. There.

27:16.726 --> 27:18.396
Huh? A parrot?

27:24.100 --> 27:26.303
Whoa! Oh!

27:27.736 --> 27:29.573
Whoa!

27:44.821 --> 27:47.824
Whoa! Oh. Aah!

27:56.832 --> 27:58.966
Oh! Aah!

27:58.968 --> 28:01.336
Oh!

28:01.338 --> 28:04.108
Give it to me!
Open your stupid beak!

28:10.613 --> 28:13.514
Huh?

28:19.221 --> 28:21.121
The photo!

28:30.499 --> 28:32.268
Huh?

28:41.244 --> 28:43.911
Don't worry, I saw it.
I know where Cape landed.

28:43.913 --> 28:46.613
What? That's great.
You're the best!

29:27.990 --> 29:30.126
Wow!

You're a little house cat.

30:13.769 --> 30:15.672
How did a little house cat
land here?

30:17.774 --> 30:21.009
In this place
of which there's no exit?

30:21.011 --> 30:22.877
I'm looking for Peachtopia.

30:22.879 --> 30:25.312
Peachtopia?

30:25.314 --> 30:27.881
Peachtopia. Feline Peachtopia!

30:27.883 --> 30:31.386
My daddy says that feline
Peachtopia is really beautiful,

30:31.388 --> 30:33.888
so I made a rocket and...

30:33.890 --> 30:35.622
..flew here to find Peachtopia.

30:35.624 --> 30:37.524
- A rocket?
- Mm.

30:37.526 --> 30:41.497
My daddy says that Peachtopia
is right here on this mountain.

30:45.034 --> 30:47.334
Why are you looking
for Peachtopia?

30:47.336 --> 30:50.540
To find my mother.
My mother left us.

30:51.841 --> 30:54.542
I really don't want to be lazy
like my daddy is,

30:54.544 --> 30:56.744
eating and sleeping
the entire day,

30:56.746 --> 30:58.415
just staring out the window.

31:00.382 --> 31:03.386
My dad says
this'll take me to Peachtopia.

31:04.486 --> 31:06.387
Hmm...

31:06.389 --> 31:08.592
- Huh?
- The raccoons are here.

31:15.331 --> 31:18.267
- Begin searching.
- Right!

31:33.816 --> 31:35.718
Huh...

31:42.992 --> 31:44.895
Ah...

31:51.900 --> 31:53.704
Hmm.

32:25.101 --> 32:27.036
Ah.

32:32.141 --> 32:33.876
Oh.

32:42.351 --> 32:44.519
The paw prints you cats make

32:44.521 --> 32:47.957
are certainly much prettier
than those of us raccoons.

32:50.159 --> 32:52.126
I'm off.

32:52.128 --> 32:54.564
If there's any news,
get in touch.

33:13.182 --> 33:14.917
Huh?

33:18.621 --> 33:20.424
Wake up, wake up.

33:21.690 --> 33:23.590
- Fatty, get up.
- Huh?

33:23.592 --> 33:26.593
We were rescued by geese.
How cool is that?

33:26.595 --> 33:29.664
We're in the belly
of a huge boat.

33:29.666 --> 33:33.266
This is our home. The boat
stops at a new dock every day.

33:33.268 --> 33:36.469
We're nearly at the dock
of the mountain right now.

33:36.471 --> 33:38.973
- Thank you so much!
- Animals should help animals.

33:38.975 --> 33:40.611
Oh!

33:44.813 --> 33:47.380
The boat docks
someplace new every day.

33:47.382 --> 33:49.282
You don't ever want
to settle down?

33:49.284 --> 33:51.118
And what if...

33:51.120 --> 33:53.119
What if the crew
discover you all here?

33:53.121 --> 33:55.956
If they do,
we'll just go elsewhere.

33:55.958 --> 34:00.194
Everywhere is so crowded.
We just occupy the corners.

34:00.196 --> 34:02.897
But we can't just hide,
never going out.

34:02.899 --> 34:04.965
We would suffocate!

34:04.967 --> 34:06.900
Every day,
we go someplace different,

34:06.902 --> 34:10.370
so every day
we discover a new place.

34:10.371 --> 34:12.672
Aah!

34:19.649 --> 34:25.485
Hey, I'm coming too!

34:25.487 --> 34:28.759
Huh?

34:33.329 --> 34:39.199
Huh?

34:39.202 --> 34:41.668
Daddy, come play with us,
please!

34:41.670 --> 34:44.638
Sure! Here I come.

34:48.610 --> 34:52.146
Whoo!

35:12.302 --> 35:15.135
Thanks so much.

35:15.137 --> 35:17.907
If only my dad
was as tough as you.

35:19.342 --> 35:23.311
That Peachtopia,
does it really exist?

35:23.313 --> 35:26.146
Is it really here
on the mountain?

35:26.148 --> 35:28.783
It is.

35:28.785 --> 35:30.617
Really?

35:30.619 --> 35:32.787
It's at the bottom of the lake.

35:32.789 --> 35:36.823
Feline Peachtopia,

35:36.825 --> 35:39.093
the valley of cats.

35:39.095 --> 35:43.263
There's a river
lined with peach trees.

35:43.265 --> 35:46.700
In winter, the river freezes.

35:46.702 --> 35:48.669
You can step on it easily

35:48.671 --> 35:51.939
and you can glide
really far distances -

35:51.941 --> 35:56.209
so far you begin to wonder
what's beyond the valley,

35:56.211 --> 35:59.483
what the world is like
beyond Peachtopia.

36:00.950 --> 36:04.354
You've been to Peachtopia?
You came from Peachtopia?

36:05.688 --> 36:09.189
That necklace,
I gave it to your dad.

36:09.191 --> 36:13.160
You know my father?
You gave him this necklace?

36:13.162 --> 36:16.430
He was just a kitten then,
just like you are now.

36:16.432 --> 36:18.332
That's so great!

36:18.334 --> 36:21.769
If my father knew I met you,
he'd be so happy!

36:21.771 --> 36:24.905
Super! Peachtopia!
Let's go there together!

36:24.907 --> 36:27.244
I can't go back to Peachtopia.

36:28.311 --> 36:30.276
But so what?

36:30.278 --> 36:33.082
Peachtopia is just a place,
a place like any other.

36:35.318 --> 36:38.352
It's that lake,
on the bottom.

36:38.354 --> 36:41.789
It's very deep with undertows.
Dangerous.

36:41.791 --> 36:43.657
I'm not scared!

36:43.659 --> 36:46.093
That doesn't mean
it's not dangerous.

36:46.095 --> 36:49.696
The cat your father knew
thought Peachtopia was small

36:49.698 --> 36:51.966
and the world was big.

36:51.968 --> 36:56.836
That cat, now he's just
an old cat afraid to go home,

36:56.838 --> 36:59.340
one of a pack of lonely strays,

36:59.342 --> 37:01.278
passing the days in this dive.

37:03.046 --> 37:05.649
That necklace
will bring you bad luck.

37:06.782 --> 37:08.617
Throw it away.

37:17.626 --> 37:20.961
Listen, go up past the factory.
That's where your son landed.

37:20.963 --> 37:23.332
- Thank you. Come on, Mack.
- Mm.

37:25.001 --> 37:26.901
And when you find your son,

37:26.903 --> 37:29.169
tell him we all think
he's really cool!

37:29.171 --> 37:31.807
Super Rocket Cat!
Super cool!

37:38.747 --> 37:44.151
I have toys. Stuffed toys.
Buy two, get one free. On sale.

37:44.153 --> 37:46.656
Aww.

37:55.331 --> 37:58.168
- Excuse me!
- Huh?

38:03.106 --> 38:05.472
Yeah. Take it to the second shop
after the tunnel.

38:05.474 --> 38:07.343
Sure, got it.

38:15.517 --> 38:18.551
It's freezing.

38:18.553 --> 38:21.622
- Hang in there.
- I'm a tropical bird.

38:21.624 --> 38:23.326
- Just hang in there.
- Tropical.

38:32.834 --> 38:36.003
- I have... I have to...
- What? Spit it out.

38:36.005 --> 38:38.008
- I need the toilet.
- Hold it in!

38:43.111 --> 38:45.479
Oh, yeah.

38:45.481 --> 38:47.648
Oh, it's warm.

38:47.650 --> 38:49.483
I-I peed.

39:45.775 --> 39:49.142
I shouldn't have told Cape
his mom went to Peachtopia.

39:49.144 --> 39:54.080
Well, when we see him,
just tell him the truth.

39:54.082 --> 39:56.916
Mack, look!
We're nearly there!

40:08.097 --> 40:10.667

Wow!

Whoa! Hey, Fatty, hurry, hurry!

40:20.675 --> 40:22.809
What is this place?

40:22.811 --> 40:26.515
- Shh. Lower your voice.
- What's that?

40:29.017 --> 40:32.186
Huh?

40:32.188 --> 40:34.488
He's hanging in the air!

40:34.490 --> 40:36.890
He's levitating. Is he a god?

Wow!

40:52.807 --> 40:57.244
You're amazing! A true master.
A master of the Way.

Too kind, too kind.

"Happy in nature,
peaks short and tall as well

41:04.486 --> 41:09.823
"Views ever changing,

41:11.760 --> 41:13.894
Hey, Master,
we're going to that mountain,

41:13.896 --> 41:15.729
but we're kind of lost.

41:15.731 --> 41:19.867
- Can you tell us the way?
- You're lost.

41:19.869 --> 41:22.102
You're lost.

41:22.104 --> 41:24.704
- Peachtopia is on the mountain.
- Peachtopia?

41:24.706 --> 41:29.376
What is Peachtopia?
It's a metaphor.

41:29.378 --> 41:32.012
Peachtopia exists
in our hearts.

41:32.014 --> 41:35.481
Only meditation leads us there.

41:35.483 --> 41:37.987
Huh?

41:38.988 --> 41:43.356
Hey, everybody! Brother Deer has
advanced in the meditative arts.

41:43.358 --> 41:47.561
Too kind, too kind. How's
Brother Antelope's Magic Pill?

41:47.563 --> 41:51.133
Well, it has
its ups and downs. Not easy.

41:52.702 --> 41:54.901
Oh. Sister Goat is here too.

41:54.903 --> 41:56.970
Oh, hello, gentlemen!

41:56.972 --> 41:58.874
So, how's the mystic calligraphy
going for you, huh?

42:00.843 --> 42:03.077
I've had
some minor breakthroughs,

42:03.079 --> 42:06.213
but Brother Deer
is still our paragon.

42:06.215 --> 42:08.548
You flatter me.

42:08.550 --> 42:11.584
Our visitors are lost
and want to go to Back Mountain.

42:11.586 --> 42:13.854
- Mm-hm.
- Back Mountain? Oh, my, my, my!

42:13.856 --> 42:15.722
You mustn't go over there!

42:15.724 --> 42:18.992
Because it's your first time,
and you don't already know,

42:18.994 --> 42:21.695
I'll tell you about
the glass factory.

42:21.697 --> 42:23.830
It's very dangerous.

42:23.832 --> 42:27.934
It's full of nasty raccoons
who kidnap other animals.

42:27.936 --> 42:32.606
Yeah. Truth is, cities
and people are everywhere now.

42:32.608 --> 42:35.541
For us animals,
it's all dangerous.

42:35.543 --> 42:38.678
Only this cloth-dyeing plant
is peaceful,

42:38.680 --> 42:40.948
so we live as hermits,

42:40.950 --> 42:44.050
meditating,
pursuing enlightenment

42:44.052 --> 42:47.120
and release from the human world

42:47.122 --> 42:50.124
to the nirvana of animal souls.

42:50.126 --> 42:52.825
Hey,
why don't you stay with us?

42:52.827 --> 42:55.028
We happen to need two disciples.

42:55.030 --> 42:57.330
You can receive
our mystical secrets.

42:57.332 --> 42:58.899
True, true!

42:58.901 --> 43:02.336
I can see your potential. I can.

43:02.338 --> 43:04.905
I appreciate your offer,
but I have to find my son.

43:04.907 --> 43:06.673
If where he went
is that dangerous,

43:06.675 --> 43:08.642
it's even more important
that I find him.

43:08.644 --> 43:13.012
Oh, family keeps you
in the secular world.

43:13.014 --> 43:16.682
- What about the lady?
- I'm interested, I'm interested!

43:16.684 --> 43:19.119
Oh, tell me your secrets.

43:19.121 --> 43:21.254
We'll find Cape
and then we'll come back.

43:21.256 --> 43:22.990
You are so powerful.

43:22.992 --> 43:26.095
You're so amazing! Teach me,
teach me, teach me now!

43:32.934 --> 43:36.336
How dare you play
such dirty tricks!

43:36.338 --> 43:39.539
- No respect! No respect!
- Catch them!

43:39.541 --> 43:44.012
- Aah!
- There's no escape! Stop!

43:50.820 --> 43:52.986
Look, the mountain!

43:59.561 --> 44:01.562
- It's a trap!
- It's a trap!

44:01.564 --> 44:03.564
Go up! Go up!

44:08.369 --> 44:10.072
Come on!

44:20.515 --> 44:22.284
Huh?

44:23.586 --> 44:25.419
Huh?

45:17.639 --> 45:20.173
It's so late. Why call us back?

45:20.175 --> 45:22.943
Well, the boss says
he's inspired

45:22.945 --> 45:25.579
and to get ready.

45:25.581 --> 45:27.483
Hmm? Why is
the aerostatic press on?

45:45.300 --> 45:48.003
Hey! Underwater currents!

45:52.874 --> 45:55.945
What is this hose
doing in the water?

46:04.019 --> 46:06.890
Agh!

46:38.621 --> 46:40.456
Hmm.

46:52.534 --> 46:54.267
- Huh.
- Are they gone?

46:54.269 --> 46:57.204
Shh! Looks like it.

46:57.206 --> 46:58.972
Those must be the raccoons.

46:58.974 --> 47:01.041
Yeah, so dangerous!

47:01.043 --> 47:03.376
Let's get out of here.
The mountain's up ahead.

47:07.682 --> 47:09.983
Taste my Falling Leaf
kung fu! Hi-ya!

47:09.985 --> 47:11.785
- Stop!
- Huh?

47:11.787 --> 47:13.687
Hm.

47:16.825 --> 47:20.229
This way, this way.
This way.

47:21.563 --> 47:23.829
Heh!

47:29.771 --> 47:32.107
Oh! Huh?

47:37.746 --> 47:39.479
Go away.

47:43.584 --> 47:45.484
Hurry, up here!

47:45.486 --> 47:47.287
Stop right there!

47:47.289 --> 47:49.488
And that's my Power Kick!

47:51.260 --> 47:53.593
Huh?

47:53.595 --> 47:55.365
Huh?

48:02.637 --> 48:04.470
He isn't wearing the necklace.

48:04.472 --> 48:06.640
Where did it go, huh?

48:06.642 --> 48:08.642
Could it be in the lake?

48:08.644 --> 48:10.609
Here's surveillance footage,

48:10.611 --> 48:12.713
from before he fell
into the lake,

48:12.715 --> 48:14.481
when he came
onto the property.

48:14.483 --> 48:16.082
He's not wearing
the necklace.

48:33.235 --> 48:36.102
The boss is upstairs.
How come you're here?

48:36.104 --> 48:37.840
It's you!

48:40.508 --> 48:42.274
What are you doing?

48:42.276 --> 48:44.811
Training. I want to jump out.

48:44.813 --> 48:46.912
You've no idea.

48:46.914 --> 48:50.850
On the last day of every month,
he chooses one animal

48:50.852 --> 48:55.354
to make a mould for those
terrifying sculptures of his...

48:55.356 --> 48:57.325
..alive!

48:58.961 --> 49:00.827
The boss says that doing this

49:00.829 --> 49:02.863
gives the work
its special spark.

49:02.865 --> 49:05.332
As for those animals here...

49:08.369 --> 49:11.807
..today... today is
the last day of the month.

49:14.709 --> 49:16.575
Uh, you...

49:16.577 --> 49:18.311
You're...

49:18.313 --> 49:21.948
Little Blanket,
all grown up.

49:38.499 --> 49:41.100
Cape's been here?
And they've taken him?

49:41.102 --> 49:43.803
Mm.

49:43.805 --> 49:46.008
I have to save him.

49:53.816 --> 49:56.084
There's electricity.

49:58.820 --> 50:01.289
- Blanket!
- Blanket!

50:02.825 --> 50:05.091
Blanket!

50:06.762 --> 50:08.327
Ooh!

50:10.698 --> 50:12.635
Agh!

50:20.142 --> 50:22.776
Blanket!

50:22.778 --> 50:26.048
Must... find Cape...

50:32.621 --> 50:34.720
Huh?

50:42.064 --> 50:44.164
The boss is coming.

50:55.142 --> 50:58.077
So, I guess today is the day
for a new mould.

50:58.079 --> 51:00.146
What are you thinking, huh?

51:00.148 --> 51:02.883
Listen, I had the raccoons
out on patrol.

51:02.885 --> 51:04.584
Look! They got lucky.

51:04.586 --> 51:07.354
They were able to catch
some rare specimens.

51:07.356 --> 51:09.158
Untie them and chuck 'em in.
Be quick.

51:11.360 --> 51:13.392
Look here. Look at this.

51:13.394 --> 51:16.262
The wild ones
have great musculature.

51:16.264 --> 51:19.334
The long-termers
get a bit withered.

51:20.869 --> 51:23.372
So, tell me, boss,
which one inspires you?

51:25.807 --> 51:28.343
Oh, how's this one here?

51:29.510 --> 51:31.811
Or... or this one?

51:31.813 --> 51:33.479
This?

51:33.481 --> 51:35.015
This?

51:35.017 --> 51:36.152
This?

51:49.731 --> 51:51.965
Him!

51:51.967 --> 51:54.501
Oh! But what about
the necklace?

51:54.503 --> 51:57.336
- Any news of it?
- Uh, still none.

51:57.338 --> 51:59.472
Still no news of it?

52:01.977 --> 52:06.178
The necklace is lost, just
like... my inspiration is gone!

52:06.180 --> 52:08.481
I can't make anything,
nothing sells!

52:08.483 --> 52:11.153
This factory
is completely doomed!

52:12.387 --> 52:16.622
Since it's doomed,
I want you to make me moulds

52:16.624 --> 52:20.496
from all of them, one by one,
until they're all dead.

52:22.164 --> 52:25.101
Cats! Cats are the worst.

52:26.635 --> 52:28.934
Start with him!

52:28.936 --> 52:31.470
Torment him to death,

52:31.472 --> 52:33.441
then throw him in the kiln!

52:37.111 --> 52:39.111
Understood?

52:39.113 --> 52:42.048
You know, in the past,
if an artist was blocked,

52:42.050 --> 52:44.818
he would throw
a live animal into the kiln.

52:44.820 --> 52:46.889
It was called a sacrifice.

52:48.456 --> 52:51.957
Actually, it's a shame
to burn them in the kiln.

52:54.128 --> 52:56.129
Exactly.
These four-legged creatures

52:56.131 --> 52:58.698
who've run in the woods
make great stew.

52:58.700 --> 53:00.566
True. They're so gamey.

53:00.568 --> 53:02.404
They make delicious soup.

53:03.671 --> 53:06.039
Whoa!

53:06.041 --> 53:08.240
- You bumped into me!
- What's wrong with you two?

53:08.242 --> 53:10.075
- It was him.
- You must be blind.

53:10.077 --> 53:12.879
Because I... I didn't!

53:17.519 --> 53:19.956
We'll look for Cape
in the morning.

53:24.492 --> 53:26.828
Blanket, look.

53:27.963 --> 53:29.662
My mate.

53:29.664 --> 53:32.798
Later we had Cape.

53:32.800 --> 53:36.803
You can't imagine
how tiny he was at first,

53:36.805 --> 53:40.106
and so adorably pink,
with his closed eyes.

53:40.108 --> 53:43.142
He opened his eyes
and he looked at me.

53:43.144 --> 53:44.878
My son.

53:44.880 --> 53:46.282
You're a dad, Blanket.

53:50.184 --> 53:51.953
And even later...

54:17.746 --> 54:21.080
Blanket!
You stay right here!

54:46.842 --> 54:49.175
I haven't been
a good protector,

54:49.177 --> 54:51.343
but I have to protect him.

54:51.345 --> 54:53.713
I must find Cape!
I'm going now!

54:53.715 --> 54:55.517
Now?

55:28.182 --> 55:30.015
Cape! Cape!

55:30.017 --> 55:32.251
Huh?

55:32.253 --> 55:35.687
Cape! On your right!
On your right!

55:35.689 --> 55:37.457
Hey, hey.

55:37.459 --> 55:39.124
- Hey.
- Huh?

55:39.126 --> 55:41.126
Look. There's a parrot.

55:41.128 --> 55:43.363
Aunty Mack!

55:46.001 --> 55:49.602
Hey, Cape. Your dad and I
are here to save you!

55:49.604 --> 55:53.372
- Dad's here?
- Yes, your dad. He's the best!

55:53.374 --> 55:56.341
He jumped out the window and
followed you across the river.

55:56.343 --> 55:58.644
He fought cormorants and goats.

55:58.646 --> 56:00.613
And now he's here to save you.

56:00.615 --> 56:02.515
- Of course, there's me too.
- Daddy!

56:02.517 --> 56:04.983
Huh?

56:10.457 --> 56:12.160
Huh?

56:13.561 --> 56:15.528
- Agh!
- Just wait.

56:15.530 --> 56:18.231
We're coming back to save you!
And the others too.

56:18.233 --> 56:20.166
- All of you!
- I'll get you!

56:20.168 --> 56:23.970
- My daddy?
- That grey cat is your father?

56:23.972 --> 56:26.405
We met that grey cat.
He's your dad?

56:26.407 --> 56:29.776
He's a kung fu warrior.
His skills are extraordinary.

56:29.778 --> 56:31.477
He's coming to save us?

56:31.479 --> 56:33.646
Your dad is formidable.

56:33.648 --> 56:37.316
- My dad!
- Wonderful! Wonderful!

56:37.318 --> 56:38.917
It's so wonderful.

56:38.919 --> 56:41.823
Ugh!

56:43.157 --> 56:46.191
My dad's gonna save me.
I'm getting out of here!

56:46.193 --> 56:49.294
The last time that I escaped,

56:49.296 --> 56:52.635
I waited until the raccoons
went on their meal break.

56:56.371 --> 56:58.437
I reached out...

56:58.439 --> 57:01.506
..and grabbed
that stiff, heavy lock.

57:01.508 --> 57:03.475
I pulled and pulled...

57:03.477 --> 57:06.014
..and I escaped!

57:09.550 --> 57:11.686
Take that, you stupid monkey.

57:12.854 --> 57:14.687
Now the lock's too far away.

57:14.689 --> 57:16.725
There's no way I can reach it.

57:21.095 --> 57:23.129
- I have a way.
- Huh?

57:23.131 --> 57:25.465
- Huh?
- Oh, oh! Tell us!

57:25.467 --> 57:27.934
What is it? Tell us!

57:37.979 --> 57:40.182
Huh? What?

57:46.521 --> 57:49.655
Oh! Oh!

57:49.657 --> 57:51.624
Ow.

57:51.626 --> 57:53.992
Ow, that hurts!

57:53.994 --> 57:56.531
Go get ready!

58:05.340 --> 58:08.140
Almost there, guys.

58:08.142 --> 58:10.443
It's not strong enough.

58:10.445 --> 58:12.778
Huh?

58:12.780 --> 58:14.483
Support it, quick!

58:22.456 --> 58:24.159
Quick, quick, quick!

58:25.459 --> 58:27.626
Huh?

58:27.628 --> 58:30.262
- Someone's here!
- Hurry!

58:44.845 --> 58:47.248
I'm an idiot. You pull this one.

58:50.751 --> 58:52.587
Huh?

58:58.959 --> 59:01.530
Hah! You're playing with
your feeders now, huh?

59:02.831 --> 59:05.133
Here's some plastic bags.
Play with these.

59:07.468 --> 59:10.602
- Did you find Cape?
- Yeah, I did. I found him.

59:10.604 --> 59:13.271
He's trapped
in a teeny, tiny little cage.

59:13.273 --> 59:15.043
Oh, poor Cape.

59:16.276 --> 59:18.977
What's to think about?
Let's go already!

59:18.979 --> 59:20.912
- We...
- Hey, raccoons outside.

59:20.914 --> 59:22.717
Take it.

59:36.097 --> 59:39.097
I'm pretty smart too.
But where could I go?

59:39.099 --> 59:43.736
Out there is a very cruel
and ruthless world.

59:45.740 --> 59:49.075
We raccoons,
we get run over by cars,

59:49.077 --> 59:50.977
get kicked or chased by kids.

59:50.979 --> 59:53.780
At best, we raccoons
end up in a cage at the zoo.

59:53.782 --> 59:56.282
A cage.

59:56.284 --> 01:00:01.153
Worst-case scenario, we land
in a pot of raccoon soup.

01:00:01.155 --> 01:00:03.257
Terrifying. Terrifying.

01:00:15.503 --> 01:00:18.307
Hm.

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.543
You're a smart raccoon.
You know the truth.

01:00:26.447 --> 01:00:29.215
Humph.

01:00:29.217 --> 01:00:32.617
They say you cats
only look after yourselves.

01:00:32.619 --> 01:00:34.720
Cats also mind
their own business.

01:00:34.722 --> 01:00:37.557
Good. How's this?

01:00:37.559 --> 01:00:41.461
You're no stranger, so I'm
giving you a choice here, OK?

01:00:41.463 --> 01:00:44.196
You give up the cat
and the necklace

01:00:44.198 --> 01:00:46.365
and nothing changes, OK?

01:00:46.367 --> 01:00:49.367
Or you can just hand over
the necklace.

01:00:49.369 --> 01:00:53.238
But that's the end
of your precious little bar.

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:56.075
Getting a choice
does have its price.

01:00:56.077 --> 01:00:58.744
Now, I... I can set you free,

01:00:58.746 --> 01:01:01.383
and you leave this place
with the grey cat.

01:01:02.916 --> 01:01:05.318
Which do you think
I'll choose?

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:09.321
Each option has its benefits
and its price as well.

01:01:09.323 --> 01:01:11.390
It's not easy.

01:01:11.392 --> 01:01:13.925
No, it's not easy.
Not easy at all.

01:01:13.927 --> 01:01:16.329
Is this not
the agony of choice?

01:01:16.331 --> 01:01:18.865
And the fun of it all too?

01:01:31.012 --> 01:01:33.278
I overheard your conversation
just now.

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:34.646
I'll rescue Cape myself.

01:01:34.648 --> 01:01:37.517
- What the raccoon said...
- It makes sense.

01:01:37.519 --> 01:01:40.151
I heard what you said too.

01:01:40.153 --> 01:01:42.053
I was just humouring him.

01:01:42.055 --> 01:01:44.323
I won't make things
hard for you.

01:01:44.325 --> 01:01:46.227
You don't have to choose.

01:01:52.032 --> 01:01:53.899
Have the necklace.

01:01:53.901 --> 01:01:56.068
So, you're off to save Cape?

01:01:56.070 --> 01:01:57.870
Worst-case,
I fail and get caught.

01:01:57.872 --> 01:02:00.372
I'll be with him then.

01:02:00.374 --> 01:02:03.142
- Let's go, Mack.
- Yeah.

01:02:16.691 --> 01:02:19.828
- Let's go! It's mould time.
- Move it.

01:02:32.807 --> 01:02:34.840
It's somewhere near here.

01:02:34.842 --> 01:02:36.943
Come on, let's look over there.

01:02:36.945 --> 01:02:38.780
Go.

01:03:11.479 --> 01:03:13.916
Cape!

01:03:21.956 --> 01:03:24.856
No, Cape.

01:04:01.162 --> 01:04:03.497
Daddy! Daddy!

01:04:06.166 --> 01:04:09.371
I'm over here!

01:04:15.410 --> 01:04:17.346
Whoa! Hey!

01:04:51.512 --> 01:04:53.215
Daddy!

01:04:59.019 --> 01:05:00.952
- They got Dad!
- Cape!

01:05:00.954 --> 01:05:03.455
He's in danger!
They think I died!

01:05:03.457 --> 01:05:07.158
I have to get him!
I have to tell him I'm alive!

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.061
- You can't save him.
- I have to save him!

01:05:09.063 --> 01:05:11.166
Cape!

01:05:15.903 --> 01:05:18.570
Cape!

01:05:18.572 --> 01:05:20.805
- Let me go!
- Your dad wants you to be safe.

01:05:20.807 --> 01:05:23.776
- You're all he has.
- No! I have to save my dad.

01:05:23.778 --> 01:05:26.479
We're going to Peachtopia
to find Mom!

01:05:26.481 --> 01:05:28.747
Your mom isn't in Peachtopia.

01:05:31.251 --> 01:05:33.619
She's not in Peachtopia?

01:05:33.621 --> 01:05:35.653
Mama...

01:05:35.655 --> 01:05:38.090
There's only me?

01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:42.997
Your mom died long ago.
Your dad told me.

01:05:44.131 --> 01:05:46.300
You're lying.

01:05:52.874 --> 01:05:58.144
Maybe we can use this.
There's you too.

01:06:13.994 --> 01:06:16.829
Biggie! Biggie!

01:06:16.831 --> 01:06:18.763
Huh?

01:06:18.765 --> 01:06:21.903
- Look who's here.
- Huh?

01:06:31.077 --> 01:06:33.646
But things have changed
drastically.

01:06:33.648 --> 01:06:36.981
The fat cat is now in my hands,
not in yours.

01:06:36.983 --> 01:06:40.251
I'll give you the necklace and
I'll give you the kitten too.

01:06:40.253 --> 01:06:43.354
You give me the grey cat
and let us leave this place.

01:06:43.356 --> 01:06:48.593
Oh, so the fat grey cat means
a lot to you, does he, huh?

01:06:48.595 --> 01:06:50.629
He saved my life.

01:06:50.631 --> 01:06:53.832
Hmm. Sounds reasonable.

01:06:53.834 --> 01:06:59.470
But then what if this is just
a little dirty trick, huh?

01:06:59.472 --> 01:07:02.474
On your territory.
We'll do the trade in your HQ.

01:07:02.476 --> 01:07:04.609
Hmm.

01:07:04.611 --> 01:07:06.711
OK. You've got yourself
a deal.

01:07:06.713 --> 01:07:09.448
You had to make
a tough choice,

01:07:09.450 --> 01:07:11.983
but it's still better
than not making one at all.

01:07:11.985 --> 01:07:15.653
You did, and I'm very happy.

01:07:17.724 --> 01:07:21.630
Actually, when you go,
I'm going to miss you.

01:07:27.568 --> 01:07:30.236
Hurry! Move it!

01:07:36.843 --> 01:07:38.744
Huh?

01:07:40.581 --> 01:07:42.615
- Daddy!
- Huh?

01:07:42.617 --> 01:07:45.517
- It's Cape! You're alive?
- Yes, Dad, I'm alive!

01:07:45.519 --> 01:07:48.820
Cape's alive! My son is alive!

01:07:48.822 --> 01:07:51.490
Cape's alive! He didn't die!

01:07:51.492 --> 01:07:53.358
He's alive!

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:55.961
- Let me go!
- OK, let's do it.

01:07:55.963 --> 01:07:58.600
You take the grey cat
and I keep the kitten.

01:08:00.367 --> 01:08:02.269
Sorry.

01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:05.271
- Now, let's go.
- No!

01:08:05.273 --> 01:08:07.472
Let my son go! Let my son go!

01:08:11.211 --> 01:08:14.113
Sorry. I change my mind a lot.

01:08:14.115 --> 01:08:16.649
I've thought it over.
Not gonna happen.

01:08:16.651 --> 01:08:18.950
- I have to take you hostage.
- You...

01:08:18.952 --> 01:08:21.720
Son, you're alive!

01:08:21.721 --> 01:08:23.321
Wonderful. So wonderful!

01:08:23.323 --> 01:08:25.126
Daddy!

01:08:27.461 --> 01:08:30.062
Kidnapping me is no use.

01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:33.231
Out there are men, walls,
electric fences.

01:08:33.233 --> 01:08:36.466
You already know
this is a place of no exit.

01:08:36.469 --> 01:08:39.069
I know that.
We're in, not going out.

01:08:44.911 --> 01:08:47.111
Move.

01:08:47.113 --> 01:08:49.580
Cape! Little Cape! Blanket!

01:08:51.484 --> 01:08:53.819
You're awesome, Cape!

01:09:05.165 --> 01:09:07.800
Little Cape, what a hero.

01:09:07.801 --> 01:09:09.767
You saved all of us!

01:09:09.769 --> 01:09:11.537
You're awesome, Cape.

01:09:11.538 --> 01:09:15.109
Hah!

01:09:16.076 --> 01:09:17.810
Blanket.

01:09:21.615 --> 01:09:23.585
- Hey, Cape.
- Huh?

01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:32.256
What now?
You still can't get out.

01:09:32.259 --> 01:09:34.725
Hmm. We're not leaving.

01:09:34.728 --> 01:09:36.928
Right, we're going
all the way in.

01:09:36.930 --> 01:09:39.465
To Peachtopia!

01:09:39.466 --> 01:09:42.633
Look, Cape, I'm sorry.

01:09:42.635 --> 01:09:44.502
I never told you.

01:09:44.504 --> 01:09:47.006
Your mom isn't at Peachtopia.

01:09:51.411 --> 01:09:55.146
That's OK.
Daddy, I already knew that.

01:09:55.148 --> 01:09:57.516
Everyone, come with me!

01:09:57.518 --> 01:09:59.688
Huh?

01:10:08.795 --> 01:10:10.796
Hmm!

01:10:10.798 --> 01:10:13.364
- Everyone, do as I say!
- OK.

01:10:13.366 --> 01:10:15.501
First group! Second group!

01:10:15.503 --> 01:10:17.302
Third group! Hurry!

01:10:32.952 --> 01:10:35.790
Quick! Come on.

01:10:42.028 --> 01:10:43.831
What is going on?

01:10:50.905 --> 01:10:54.009
- Huh?
- Grab them all! Now!

01:10:55.576 --> 01:10:57.245
Mm.

01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:09.057
Quick, everyone inside.

01:11:26.773 --> 01:11:28.675
Whoa!

01:11:44.125 --> 01:11:46.528
- Daddy!
- Oh!

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:56.568
Daddy, Daddy! Hurry!

01:12:23.363 --> 01:12:25.799
Oh, no. It got stuck!

01:12:43.116 --> 01:12:45.016
- Argh!
- Daddy!

01:12:45.018 --> 01:12:47.454
Go, go! Go, go! Daddy!

01:12:56.664 --> 01:12:58.797
Ya!

01:12:58.799 --> 01:13:00.699
Oh!

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:08.809
Ooh!

01:13:15.381 --> 01:13:17.783
Daddy! Ugh!

01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:58.657
Yaaa!

01:14:10.403 --> 01:14:12.473
Daddy!

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:30.254
Cape!

01:15:12.866 --> 01:15:15.132
Thank you so much.

01:15:15.134 --> 01:15:17.668
Heh. I wanted to quit ages ago.

01:15:17.670 --> 01:15:19.439
Huh!

01:15:21.674 --> 01:15:23.343
The necklace! And the bead!

01:15:24.411 --> 01:15:26.578
It's OK.

01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:30.614
It's just an ordinary
glass bead. Just a souvenir.

01:15:30.616 --> 01:15:32.919
Originally he gave it to me.

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:36.355
When I met him years ago,

01:15:36.357 --> 01:15:39.458
he was a poor worker
with big ideas.

01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:41.626
He said I inspired him.

01:15:41.628 --> 01:15:43.965
I inspired his first
cat sculptures.

01:15:45.765 --> 01:15:48.499
The bead's lovely
mutating colours

01:15:48.501 --> 01:15:51.269
were like the inspiration
he chased.

01:15:51.271 --> 01:15:54.041
The workshop
was his Peachtopia.

01:15:55.174 --> 01:15:58.843
Later he went too far,

01:15:58.845 --> 01:16:01.148
into the dark side.

01:16:02.215 --> 01:16:04.184
So I left.

01:16:05.552 --> 01:16:09.523
Later we both changed.

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:15.127
Oh!

01:16:20.467 --> 01:16:24.302
And Peachtopia,
does it really exist?

01:16:24.304 --> 01:16:28.009
Look. It's there.

01:16:29.143 --> 01:16:31.510
Ooh.

01:16:31.512 --> 01:16:36.284
Ohhh!

01:16:37.851 --> 01:16:40.621
Whoo-hoo!
Full steam ahead.

01:16:59.973 --> 01:17:01.843
Turn right, turn right!

01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:29.767
Dad. Dad!

01:17:31.638 --> 01:17:34.509
Daddy! Daddy! Wake up!

01:17:35.976 --> 01:17:38.677
- Cape.
- Quick, look!

01:17:38.679 --> 01:17:40.912
Everyone, wake up! Daddy!

01:17:43.082 --> 01:17:44.852
Huh?

01:17:49.755 --> 01:17:51.526
Hurry!

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.627
Wow!

01:18:10.611 --> 01:18:13.613
Wow!

01:18:24.323 --> 01:18:26.827
Whee!

01:19:06.866 --> 01:19:10.435
Whoa! Yeah!

01:19:10.437 --> 01:19:12.870
Whoa!

01:19:47.174 --> 01:19:50.240
Whoo! Yeah!
We're free!

01:19:53.613 --> 01:19:55.650
Huh?

01:20:28.014 --> 01:20:29.980
I want to go home.

01:20:29.982 --> 01:20:34.019
That flat across the river,
that's my home.

01:20:34.021 --> 01:20:35.854
- Daddy?
- Huh?

01:20:35.856 --> 01:20:38.288
How about I go back home
with you?

01:20:38.290 --> 01:20:41.626
I know that not everyone
has a home to go to.

01:20:44.464 --> 01:20:49.300
Hey, son, this giant world
is all yours.

01:20:49.302 --> 01:20:53.137
Go. Experience it, be daring.

01:20:53.139 --> 01:20:56.408
But if... if one day
you miss home,

01:20:56.410 --> 01:20:59.880
you know that your home
is wherever I am.

01:21:09.923 --> 01:21:13.728
Take care, take care,
my sweet, little Cape!

01:21:20.666 --> 01:21:22.600
I'm going too.

01:21:22.602 --> 01:21:25.369
My mother isn't here
in Peachtopia.

01:21:25.371 --> 01:21:26.971
Where will you go, then?

01:21:26.973 --> 01:21:29.173
Hmm. I don't know.

01:21:29.175 --> 01:21:32.377
Wherever I want to go.
Somewhere.

01:21:32.379 --> 01:21:34.314
'Bye, guys!

01:21:37.317 --> 01:21:39.984
What about us?

01:21:39.986 --> 01:21:42.654
This place doesn't suit me.

01:21:42.656 --> 01:21:44.556
Peachtopia isn't my home.

01:21:44.558 --> 01:21:47.057
No-one knows me
or is waiting for me.

01:21:47.059 --> 01:21:50.395
It doesn't suit
an old stray cat like me.

01:21:50.397 --> 01:21:54.699
Why is any place you can get to
never where you want to be?

01:21:54.701 --> 01:21:57.202
If you can't find home
in your heart,

01:21:57.204 --> 01:21:59.069
you won't find it anywhere.

01:21:59.071 --> 01:22:03.807
Even still, this is
a pretty good place to live.

01:22:03.809 --> 01:22:06.677
Set up a guard post.
Yeah, I could do that.

01:22:06.679 --> 01:22:08.812
Keep it from humans
a while longer.

01:22:08.814 --> 01:22:11.315
I'll open another bar.

01:22:11.317 --> 01:22:14.554
You need
a business partner?

01:22:22.262 --> 01:22:24.194
Daddy, Daddy!

01:22:24.196 --> 01:22:26.163
You only saw Mom fall, right?

01:22:26.165 --> 01:22:29.436
Maybe she's still alive
somewhere!

01:22:36.343 --> 01:22:40.444
<i>Wherever I go,
my mother might be there.</i>

01:22:40.446 --> 01:22:42.646
<i>I'm coming, Mom!</i>

01:22:42.648 --> 01:22:44.617
<i>I'm coming, big world.</i>

01:22:47.153 --> 01:22:49.154
<i>Hah!</i>

01:22:49.156 --> 01:22:52.190
<i>Since I was little,
I've dreamt of Peachtopia.</i>

01:22:52.192 --> 01:22:55.392
<i>And here it is.</i>

01:22:55.394 --> 01:22:58.232
<i>But Peachtopia
lives in every heart.</i>

01:23:00.332 --> 01:23:03.637
<i>It is such a special place
where you live happily.</i>

01:23:05.405 --> 01:23:09.210
<i>But Cape is off
to see the big world.</i>

01:23:10.544 --> 01:23:12.810
<i>I have a home.</i>

01:23:12.812 --> 01:23:17.317
<i>We all have to let go,
leave, and grow up.</i>

01:23:18.518 --> 01:23:21.452
<i>Maybe that's
the true Peachtopia -</i>

01:23:21.454 --> 01:23:25.125
<i>a place you long for,
but where you can't stay.</i>

01:23:29.465 --> 01:23:34.465
