WEBVTT

00:08.425 --> 00:12.134
-What did you say?
-Oh, you heard me.

00:12.304 --> 00:14.670
Come on. Keep up, slowpoke.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.760
Well, hey, I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:18.143 --> 00:19.929
You're so lonesome, Sam.

00:20.103 --> 00:22.264
I saw it in your eyes
last night at the lake.

00:22.439 --> 00:26.102
-What? It was dark. You did not.
-Did too.

00:26.902 --> 00:30.269
You're carrying that secret
like a 2-ton sack of feed on your back.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.563
And it doesn't have to be that way.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.531
Secret? What secret?

00:35.702 --> 00:37.283
Fibber.

00:39.498 --> 00:42.285
I ain't in the mood tonight, little girl.

00:43.001 --> 00:44.332
Daphne?

00:49.883 --> 00:51.623
Daphne?

01:01.144 --> 01:02.884
Well, hey.

01:05.148 --> 01:06.979
Hey, your own self.

02:40.744 --> 02:43.201
Jesus Christ!

02:43.538 --> 02:46.621
Jesus Christ, you--
You-- You-- You're--

02:46.792 --> 02:49.124
Shapeshifter, and proud of it.

02:50.045 --> 02:52.707
How'd you--?
How'd you find out about me?

02:53.382 --> 02:55.589
Last night in the woods...

02:55.926 --> 03:01.262
...I watched a dog jump in the water
and it came up you.

03:04.226 --> 03:06.387
Isn't this great?

03:07.604 --> 03:09.185
Yeah.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.972
Yeah, it's-- It's pretty great.

03:13.735 --> 03:16.067
You're not alone anymore.

03:23.829 --> 03:26.536
-Oh, crap. Hand me my drawers.
-Yeah.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.117
Hey, Terry.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.622
Arlene.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.575
Hey, Sam.

03:33.547 --> 03:36.334
-Daphne.
-Hey.

03:38.176 --> 03:40.292
Good party.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.468
Yep.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.847
-Later, darling.
-Oh, wait. Wait.

03:50.689 --> 03:52.429
It's in the air, I guess.

03:53.191 --> 03:56.228
Yeah, looks like it.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.819
See you at work.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.363
Right.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.277
Come on, special lady.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.325
Daphne?

04:13.503 --> 04:14.788
Wait!

04:14.963 --> 04:16.328
Oh, shit, she's following me.

04:16.506 --> 04:18.007
Oh, shit, shit.
What the fuck?

04:18.175 --> 04:19.836
Are you always so afraid?

04:20.010 --> 04:22.001
I'm the last person
you should be afraid of.

04:22.179 --> 04:25.262
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
Sookie Stackhouse.

04:25.849 --> 04:26.884
Gotta go.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.844
-We have to talk about this.
-We don't.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.680
Have a good evening, sir.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.681
Well, excuse you.

04:32.856 --> 04:34.346
-Don't do that.
-He didn't hear.

04:34.524 --> 04:37.937
He's glamoured, can't you tell? Listen.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.777
His mind's full of fog and disco music.

04:44.951 --> 04:48.284
By the way, they can't glamour me.
Can they glamour you?

04:48.455 --> 04:49.991
No, but I fake it.

04:50.165 --> 04:51.826
You ever hear any vampire thoughts?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.740
God, no.

04:53.919 --> 04:56.706
-Don't even say that out loud.
-I didn't.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.461
I don't know what little
fried corn-on-the-cob town...

05:01.635 --> 05:04.092
...you're from, or what candy-ass
vampires you're with...

05:04.262 --> 05:05.547
...but this is Dallas, baby.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.963
You watch your tone.
Don't you call me "baby."

05:08.141 --> 05:10.848
Dallas vamps are serious
and scary as shit.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.600
Mine are too, thank you very much.

05:12.771 --> 05:16.889
-I had to learn how to handle myself.
-If they knew, they would suck us dry.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.433
They'd do worse than that.
You think I don't know?

05:19.611 --> 05:22.148
We need to swap stories.
We can help each other.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.313
I don't want any help.
Just forget about it.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.528
You can't tell anybody about me, please.

05:31.706 --> 05:33.537
Jessica, we discussed this.

05:33.708 --> 05:37.826
All I did was order him off the menu.
You didn't say not to order off the menu.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.495
I would no more allow you
to feed on that young man...

05:40.674 --> 05:42.835
...than to watch pornography
on television.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.965
-Porno?
-Jessica....

05:45.136 --> 05:47.092
Hey, Sookie, there's dirty movies on TV.

05:47.264 --> 05:49.471
I know, yuck.

05:49.641 --> 05:52.007
To your room, please. Tru Blood.

05:52.561 --> 05:55.928
You are going to be so sorry
when | get an eating disorder.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.813
Private! Keep out!

05:59.484 --> 06:01.645
Sookie, where have you been?

06:01.820 --> 06:05.358
l was asking the bellboy
if there's a candy machine...

06:05.532 --> 06:07.272
...what's a continental breakfast--

06:07.450 --> 06:09.736
You cannot wander off on your own.

06:09.911 --> 06:12.448
The situation here
is more complicated than we thought.

06:12.622 --> 06:15.534
We don't know nearly enough
about the Dallas vampires.

06:16.042 --> 06:19.785
They can't touch me. I'm yours.

06:21.256 --> 06:25.545
Every single part of me.

06:25.719 --> 06:29.758
Completely and totally yours.

06:29.931 --> 06:32.764
I don't think it matters
to them, sweetheart.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.311
As long as it matters to you.

06:35.478 --> 06:38.470
SooMe.SooMe,SooMe.

06:38.982 --> 06:40.392
Tell me you understand.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.611
Bill, I've known since the airport...

06:47.782 --> 06:51.900
...that we're up to our necks
in a big old vampire mess again.

06:52.078 --> 06:56.822
I don't want to get beat up or dead.
I'm not gonna do anything stupid.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.332
Is this room secure, do you think?

06:59.502 --> 07:00.833
I believe so, but one would--

07:01.004 --> 07:07.250
Then, honey, for a little while,
let's not worry.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.843
We have something to be happy about.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.095
I don't think so.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.880
Yes, we do.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.226
We're in a vampire hotel.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.387
It's light-tight.

07:24.653 --> 07:27.144
For the very first time...

07:29.741 --> 07:32.949
...you don't have to leave me
alone in bed at dawn.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.527
| forgot about that.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.035
I didn't.

07:42.253 --> 07:44.835
My only desire is to keep you safe.

07:48.426 --> 07:51.293
Your only desire?

07:51.471 --> 07:52.711
Well...

07:54.224 --> 07:55.885
...no.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.232
You're talking to the man.

08:13.410 --> 08:16.902
Hoyt? Hoyt Fortenberry?

08:18.206 --> 08:20.822
Yeah. Who's this?

08:21.334 --> 08:23.120
Jessica Hamby.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.831
-Maybe you don't remember me.
-Jessica.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.496
Oh, my Lord.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.835
I remember you, all right.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.750
I can't stop thinking about you.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.260
Really?

08:34.431 --> 08:35.762
I mean, "really" really?

08:35.932 --> 08:38.389
"Really" really and then some more.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.558
-Hoyt!
-Can you hang on?

08:40.729 --> 08:42.970
Who the heck is calling you
at this time of night?

08:43.148 --> 08:45.184
It's a girl, isn't it? I know it's a girl.

08:45.358 --> 08:48.020
Well, you tell her it's not decent
or ladylike to--

08:48.194 --> 08:51.686
How dare you lock the door on me
in my own house.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.700
So where were we?

08:57.871 --> 09:01.830
Well, you were telling me how
you couldn't stop thinking about me...

09:02.000 --> 09:05.913
...and, well,
I can't stop thinking about you.

09:06.504 --> 09:09.120
I'm all bored here in Dallas.

09:09.299 --> 09:12.336
You want to watch TV together
long-distance?

09:12.886 --> 09:15.252
Or I could tell you about my comic book.

09:15.430 --> 09:16.795
Well, we could do both.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.305
I mean, I would just love that.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.591
Okay.

09:21.770 --> 09:24.011
So it's called Space Tomb.

09:24.189 --> 09:26.271
This time
they're on the planetAstoria...

09:26.441 --> 09:28.932
...and sea leopards
are just pitching a ﬁt.

09:33.490 --> 09:34.775
Get up! Get up! Get up!

09:34.949 --> 09:37.531
-I said get up. Put on your sweats.
-What's happening?

09:37.702 --> 09:41.570
Come on, let's haul your butt outside,
you pansy fangbanger.

09:41.748 --> 09:42.988
-Let's go!
-God.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.953
My God, that's right.
Rise and shine for God!

09:46.127 --> 09:49.085
Come on, let's go. Move, move, move!

09:49.255 --> 09:50.665
Stand up straight.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.047
Make a line you can be proud of.

09:53.218 --> 09:57.803
Let's go. You're supposed to be
leadership material.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.837
Mrs. Newlin.

10:00.016 --> 10:03.053
I know you're wondering
what this is all about.

10:03.228 --> 10:08.313
Well, God needs your obedience.
God needs your will and your faith.

10:08.483 --> 10:11.725
And in due time,
all will be revealed to you.

10:11.903 --> 10:15.020
Could somebody reveal a bathroom?
Because I really need one.

10:15.198 --> 10:18.190
Sorry, not till you've earned it.

10:18.368 --> 10:22.407
Jumping jacks, everyone. Let's go.
Maximum effort.

10:23.540 --> 10:24.905
Too good for this, Stackhouse?

10:25.083 --> 10:27.699
I'm telling you,
I wanna see a change in your attitude.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.413
I wanna see command presence.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.248
You gonna do the Lord's work?

10:31.422 --> 10:33.629
You feel like walking away, go ahead.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.883
You stay, you drop and give me 30.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.886
I said, give me 30!

10:42.559 --> 10:45.426
I'll tell you when you can laugh,
you pissant little sinner.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.594
Give me 50.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.683
Start pushing.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.640
Anyone else?

10:51.818 --> 10:53.900
That the best you ladies can do?

10:54.070 --> 10:56.812
You disgust me, all of you. Pitiful!

10:56.990 --> 11:00.107
I pray Jesus isn't watching
this crap today.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.509
Hey, come back.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.514
I'm here.

12:08.144 --> 12:10.476
I'm right here with you.

12:11.814 --> 12:15.056
l was just thinking about
Sookie's gran.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.522
She was like my real mom.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.527
Such a good person.

12:20.698 --> 12:23.440
Truly good, through and through.

12:23.618 --> 12:24.949
What would she think of me?

12:25.119 --> 12:26.495
Oh, she'd like you.

12:26.663 --> 12:29.575
She did appreciate a handsome man.

12:30.208 --> 12:33.496
-| wish I could've met her.
-Me too.

12:33.670 --> 12:37.504
She made this house
the one place in the world I felt safe.

12:38.049 --> 12:39.755
And now I'm gonna live here.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.338
Happy day after your birthday.

12:42.512 --> 12:45.970
It's the only good one I ever had,
because of you.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.432
It's the first of many, Tara Mae.

13:34.230 --> 13:37.063
This is a continental breakfast?

13:37.734 --> 13:39.224
What's wrong with it?

13:39.402 --> 13:44.112
| just thought
it would be more continental.

13:44.282 --> 13:46.989
Well, the Danishes are Danish.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.741
-And they're free.
-Free?

13:48.911 --> 13:51.197
I didn't know that.
Would it be all right if l--?

13:51.372 --> 13:52.487
Yeah, whatever.

13:52.665 --> 13:56.658
-Now, Barry, let's get to it.
-Why won't you just leave me alone?

13:56.836 --> 14:00.624
Because I've never met
another telepath. Have you?

14:00.798 --> 14:03.460
No. And don't say that word.

14:03.634 --> 14:04.965
It's what you are.

14:05.136 --> 14:08.424
Nobody else knows what it's like to be us.
We need to stick together.

14:08.598 --> 14:10.259
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.799
Yes, it is. My life is shit.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.763
I can't do anything normal people do.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.893
If I'm not around vampires, I can't think.

14:17.065 --> 14:19.101
| used to feel exactly the same.

14:19.275 --> 14:21.687
-Like I had a disability.
-More like a curse.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.726
But lately, since I met my boyfriend...

14:23.905 --> 14:26.487
...it seems like telepathy
can come in handy sometimes.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.613
You can even make a little money.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.776
I'm starting to see it
in a whole new way.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.568
Then you're even crazier than I am.

14:32.747 --> 14:33.736
Brazilian wax.

14:33.915 --> 14:36.156
Feels like that bitch ripped out
my female organs.

14:36.334 --> 14:38.620
Get a vamp to pay for laser.
Somebody, bite me.

14:38.795 --> 14:40.786
Concentrate. You can shut it out.

14:40.963 --> 14:44.706
Concentrate so hard your hair hurts.
Everything goes quiet. Concentrate--

14:44.884 --> 14:46.875
Quit!

14:47.053 --> 14:50.545
Do you know if Hotel Carmilla is hiring?
There wasn't anybody at the desk.

14:50.723 --> 14:54.557
We're fully staffed, but you can fill out
an application. We'll keep it on file.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.137
Come with me.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.098
You can control it.

15:00.817 --> 15:01.932
| wish it was true.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.475
Barry, it is.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.943
I can teach you how.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.483
There's enough people
in my brain already.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.364
You're on your own.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.112
Right this way.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.631
I dreamed you were gone.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.679
You did?

15:34.725 --> 15:38.058
That's funny, because I was.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.179
SooMeuu

15:42.358 --> 15:43.859
It was only for a few minutes.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.402
I had to.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.356
Bill, it's the most amazing thing.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.566
I met another telepath.

15:50.241 --> 15:53.233
He's not very nice,
and he's not very good at it...

15:53.411 --> 15:57.529
...but, oh, it's wonderful knowing
there's somebody besides me.

15:57.707 --> 16:00.744
You made him aware of your gift
after everything I've said?

16:00.918 --> 16:02.419
Not on purpose.

16:02.587 --> 16:05.624
We were in each other's heads
before we knew it.

16:07.091 --> 16:08.752
I thought you'd be happy for me.

16:09.385 --> 16:13.924
The more people know what you do,
the harder it is for me to protect you.

16:14.307 --> 16:17.799
He can't even admit it to himself.
He's not gonna do any talking about me.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.889
-You can't be sure.
-Yes, I can.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.678
I'm good at this.

16:23.065 --> 16:26.398
Look, if all I'm supposed to do in Dallas
is shut up and take orders...

16:26.569 --> 16:29.902
...I might as well be slinging beers
at Merlotte's.

16:30.406 --> 16:33.273
You're the one who told me
l was more than a waitress.

16:33.451 --> 16:35.157
You are.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.410
-But—-
-What?

16:38.706 --> 16:39.866
Never mind.

16:40.917 --> 16:43.203
Talk to me.

16:43.377 --> 16:46.585
Lean on me. I've leaned on you plenty.

16:48.591 --> 16:53.255
Well, here I am,
responsible for you and Jessica...

16:53.429 --> 16:57.843
...and yet no decisions are mine.
And it makes me feel....

16:58.017 --> 16:59.848
Like a human?

17:02.104 --> 17:03.560
Like a waitress.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.807
You're walking in my shoes,
and it's giving you blisters.

17:13.449 --> 17:16.612
Eric is strangely intense about all this.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.160
It's not like him.

17:20.331 --> 17:21.912
I don't trust it.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.619
Don't you worry about Eric.

17:23.793 --> 17:26.330
We'll do the job and go home.

17:26.963 --> 17:28.954
A deal's a deal.

17:29.465 --> 17:32.047
Sookie, you know what he's like.

17:32.635 --> 17:35.547
What's it to him to break
a contract with a girl?

17:36.138 --> 17:37.844
A woman.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.845
He needs me.

17:42.019 --> 17:44.226
He won't want to make me mad.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.433
I can't lose you.

17:50.778 --> 17:53.144
You never will.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.786
Hope you're enjoying
that Co-Cola, Arlene.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.451
Well, thank you, Daphne, I am.

18:08.629 --> 18:12.338
Because unlike you, I actually did
my closing prep last night.

18:12.508 --> 18:15.671
I'd appreciate it if you gave me
a hand, just for today.

18:15.845 --> 18:17.551
Then you'll never learn.

18:17.722 --> 18:20.338
Now, some people around here
might let you slide on by...

18:20.516 --> 18:23.178
...but I'm thinking about
your future as a server.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.183
That's real generous.

18:25.354 --> 18:27.390
Don't forget to make the iced tea.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.689
Hey, good-looking.

18:30.860 --> 18:33.351
Hey, you.

18:35.406 --> 18:39.024
Terry, could you make
the iced tea for me, please?

18:39.827 --> 18:41.863
-Don't you do it.
-Please?

18:49.378 --> 18:50.493
Why the hell are y'all...

18:50.671 --> 18:54.004
-...putting me through this crap?
-See what you did?

18:55.885 --> 18:59.673
Mean old freckle-faced
redheaded witch.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.803
Good morning, Daphne.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.135
Back at you, boss.

19:09.106 --> 19:11.768
Hey, why'd you take off last night?

19:11.942 --> 19:14.399
I looked everywhere for you.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.231
ljust went for a little run.

19:16.405 --> 19:19.272
You know, I always seem
to need one after a shift.

19:19.450 --> 19:20.815
Hey, me too.

19:22.703 --> 19:25.661
I reckon you had all you could handle
for one night anyway.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.662
I reckon you underestimate me.

19:28.459 --> 19:31.576
-Guess we'll find out.
-When?

19:32.672 --> 19:35.129
-Soon.
-Better be.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.250
Lafayette!

19:43.015 --> 19:45.757
Terry, Lafayette's back.

19:45.935 --> 19:49.018
Thank God, brother. Thank God.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.223
Can we talk?

19:58.447 --> 20:02.406
Where the fuck have you been?

20:04.620 --> 20:07.202
Couldn't pick up a damn phone?

20:07.373 --> 20:08.738
Sorry.

20:08.916 --> 20:12.249
Well, sorry's not good enough.
Not only did you leave us high and dry...

20:12.420 --> 20:15.332
...but there are people here
who give a shit about you.

20:16.465 --> 20:19.081
We didn't know if you were alive or dead.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.840
Wait, ordinarily, right about now,
you'd be telling me to fuck off...

20:27.017 --> 20:30.635
...in some colorful and creative way.

20:32.481 --> 20:36.645
Well, you want to talk, do some talking.

20:36.819 --> 20:38.605
Sam...

20:38.988 --> 20:42.856
...all I want to know is,
can I have my job back?

20:43.033 --> 20:44.614
I ought to tell you to fuck off.

20:44.785 --> 20:49.199
All that pressure in the kitchen just about
put Terry back in the VA hospital.

20:53.043 --> 20:54.999
Yeah, of course
you can have yourjob back.

20:55.171 --> 20:57.002
The place ain't the same without you.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.666
Thank you, Sam.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.593
Lafayette.

21:09.310 --> 21:10.891
What happened to you?

21:25.868 --> 21:28.735
It's midnight. You're out of ammo.

21:28.913 --> 21:31.950
You got five hungry vampires
snapping at your ass.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.364
What are you gonna do?

21:34.460 --> 21:36.872
-What are you gonna do?
-Run.

21:37.046 --> 21:39.253
Run fast.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.882
Whoa, whoa, get up.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.337
You gotta keep going, Guy.

21:44.512 --> 21:46.343
Five hungry,
snapping vampires.

21:46.514 --> 21:49.506
Fuck it, I hate this. ljust
want to be a bank teller again.

21:49.683 --> 21:52.220
That's fine, dude.
Let the vampires chew you up.

21:53.771 --> 21:55.932
You're not good enough
to lead for the Lord.

21:57.274 --> 21:59.856
That's how you do it, Stackhouse.

22:00.027 --> 22:01.233
You better pace yourself.

22:01.403 --> 22:03.064
This is my pace.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.071
Asshole.

22:16.460 --> 22:18.951
Are you still here?
Or did you come back?

22:19.129 --> 22:22.587
Karl and I slept over.
Don't you remember?

22:22.758 --> 22:25.545
Maybe not. You were having
a very nice time.

22:25.719 --> 22:27.880
Maybe not. What's all this?

22:28.055 --> 22:31.422
Oh, looks like we need a place to stay.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.307
Stay today? Stay tonight?

22:35.604 --> 22:36.810
Little While.

22:36.981 --> 22:38.391
But you have your own home.

22:39.108 --> 22:40.769
That's not mine.

22:40.943 --> 22:43.400
-What?
-It belongs to one of my clients.

22:43.571 --> 22:46.062
He was out of the country,
but he's back this morning.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.400
I'm sure I told you, no?

22:47.575 --> 22:50.442
No. You-- You didn't.

22:51.120 --> 22:56.114
Look, I hate to tell you this,
but this isn't gonna work.

22:57.251 --> 22:58.787
But I assumed--

22:58.961 --> 23:01.703
I mean, we've all been so happy
living together.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.963
--that you'd want to have us close.

23:04.133 --> 23:05.669
Maryann, I'm a guest here myself.

23:05.843 --> 23:08.960
I can't be having a house full of people
Sookie doesn't even know.

23:09.138 --> 23:10.844
She wouldn't mind.

23:11.015 --> 23:12.971
You explain how much we mean to you.

23:13.142 --> 23:17.101
Don't get me wrong, I couldn't be
more grateful for everything you've done.

23:18.439 --> 23:21.055
But I don't feel right about this.

23:23.110 --> 23:27.604
You can't move in. I'm sorry.

23:29.783 --> 23:31.364
| see. Okay.

23:40.878 --> 23:43.415
Did you know Maryann wants us all
to be roommates here?

23:43.589 --> 23:45.830
Cool. I guess that other guy
came back from Peru.

23:46.008 --> 23:49.500
No, not cool. Not gonna happen.
ljust moved in.

23:49.678 --> 23:52.670
Okay, fine, we can go somewhere else,
if that's how you feel.

23:53.641 --> 23:55.973
That's all you got to say?

23:56.143 --> 23:57.553
Relax. It's no big deal.

23:57.728 --> 24:00.219
What are you, nomads?
Fucking Bedouins?

24:00.397 --> 24:02.228
We move around.
Nothing wrong with that.

24:02.399 --> 24:04.811
Nothing except I didn't know.
You could've told me.

24:04.985 --> 24:07.647
Who cares? What matters is
being with the people you love.

24:07.821 --> 24:08.981
Other things matter too.

24:09.156 --> 24:11.397
Like knowing the truth
about the people you love.

24:11.575 --> 24:15.818
So while we're on the subject,
what exactly is your thing with Maryann?

24:17.831 --> 24:21.119
When I was ready to lay down and die,
she lifted me up, same as you.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.749
You follow her wherever she goes?

24:22.920 --> 24:25.457
I'm not her dog,
if that's what you're trying to say.

24:26.382 --> 24:28.873
Why all of a sudden are you
so paranoid about Maryann?

24:29.051 --> 24:32.464
-Because I'm trying not to be a fool.
-You know what this is really about?

24:32.638 --> 24:36.051
Your history is so fucked up,
you have no clue what family is.

24:36.850 --> 24:38.681
That's not fair.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.843
I do have a clue.

24:42.064 --> 24:43.645
Sort of.

24:44.191 --> 24:45.852
Kind of.

24:46.944 --> 24:49.105
Who gives a damn about a house?

24:49.279 --> 24:51.895
Maryann, Karl and me,
we take care of each other.

24:52.074 --> 24:53.234
We took care of you.

24:56.286 --> 24:58.538
That's family, Tara.

25:04.670 --> 25:07.036
How are we gonna work on
our defensive tactics...

25:07.214 --> 25:08.829
...if we can't even climb a fence?

25:09.008 --> 25:11.169
Let's go. Next, come on.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.834
-Go on.
-Come on.

25:15.681 --> 25:19.048
Get up there, get up there.
Let's go, come on.

25:19.226 --> 25:21.763
-Come on.
-See? You should have paced yourself.

25:21.937 --> 25:24.349
If you're laying down, you better be dead.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.184
Stand up.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.099
Come on.

25:28.610 --> 25:29.816
Why do you embarrass me?

25:29.987 --> 25:32.273
Why do you straight-out embarrass me?

25:32.448 --> 25:34.609
What's your name, failure?

25:35.242 --> 25:37.858
Luke. It's Luke.

25:38.787 --> 25:41.654
Well, Luke, your entire family
has been ambushed by vampires...

25:41.832 --> 25:45.791
...and they're bleeding to death
on the other side of this fence.

25:46.003 --> 25:48.745
-No.
-Yeah. Yeah, they are.

25:48.922 --> 25:52.289
Your mama and daddy are drowning
in buckets of their own blood...

25:52.468 --> 25:55.801
...calling your name.
It's gonna be over in 30 seconds.

25:55.971 --> 25:57.336
Let's go.

25:57.514 --> 25:59.675
Nice work, Luke.

25:59.850 --> 26:01.135
They're gone. Massacred.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.972
You'll never see them again,
and it's your own damn fault.

26:04.146 --> 26:06.102
-Stay right there.
-I tried.

26:06.273 --> 26:08.434
Now what are you gonna do?

26:08.609 --> 26:09.769
He's a big fat loser.

26:09.943 --> 26:14.152
He's brought shame on himself,
shame on you, and shame on his religion.

26:14.323 --> 26:16.154
What's a real leader gonna do?

26:16.325 --> 26:18.486
Just get rid of me.

26:20.204 --> 26:21.694
Just leave me.

26:21.872 --> 26:23.328
Up to you.

26:32.841 --> 26:36.880
Luke, look at me. Hey.

26:38.388 --> 26:41.425
It's only a damn fence. Come on.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.556
Come on.

26:46.355 --> 26:47.936
I got you, brother.

26:50.984 --> 26:52.975
It's not too late.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.107
You're gonna save your family.

26:57.533 --> 26:59.694
Now that's a fricking soldier of God.

27:01.036 --> 27:03.197
-Good job.
-Good job, Jason.

27:03.372 --> 27:04.487
Praise his light.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.031
Good work.

27:08.210 --> 27:10.292
-Next. Let's go, let's go.
-Come on, guys.

27:15.134 --> 27:18.046
You should have told me
Eric hired a fucking human, Isabel.

27:18.220 --> 27:19.926
Now, waitjust a minute.

27:20.097 --> 27:21.587
-Respect her.
-Thank you.

27:21.765 --> 27:24.723
I couldn't tell you, Stan.
You've been off on your own for days.

27:24.893 --> 27:27.475
Are you certain Godric was abducted
by the Fellowship?

27:27.646 --> 27:28.681
-Yes.
-No.

27:28.856 --> 27:31.472
They're the only ones
with the organization and manpower.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.107
But they're amateurs.
It doesn't make any sense.

27:34.278 --> 27:37.361
This is Godric we're talking about,
2000 years old.

27:37.531 --> 27:39.487
-Old don't make you smart.
-Two thousand?

27:39.658 --> 27:41.649
Besides, there's no proof.

27:41.827 --> 27:44.819
If they've got him, I'll hear it.
That's my job.

27:44.997 --> 27:47.204
There's no reason to wait.

27:47.374 --> 27:49.865
We need to take these fanatics down.
Full-out attack.

27:50.043 --> 27:53.831
Exterminate them like the vermin they are,
leave no trace.

27:54.464 --> 27:57.592
Vampire-hating church annihilated.
Wonder who did it?

27:57.759 --> 27:58.839
Fucking brilliant.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.047
The king wouldn't approve
the destruction...

28:01.221 --> 28:03.086
...of our international political agenda.

28:03.265 --> 28:04.755
Fuck that.

28:04.933 --> 28:07.549
The Great Revelation is the biggest mistake
we ever made.

28:07.728 --> 28:10.811
Don't use Godric to make
your own little power play.

28:11.106 --> 28:13.188
You're completely incompetent.

28:14.401 --> 28:17.359
What's happened to Godric
that he surrounds himself with clowns?

28:18.030 --> 28:20.362
We invited you as a courtesy.

28:20.532 --> 28:23.569
This is not your territory.
You have no voice here.

28:23.744 --> 28:25.484
Yeah, sheriff.

28:25.662 --> 28:29.154
Why don't you run on back to Louisiana?
We don't need you or your puppets.

28:29.333 --> 28:31.870
-Oh, I'm not going anywhere.
-And I'm nobody's puppet.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.830
What we need is a plan.

28:35.380 --> 28:36.916
It's not a plan, it's a movie.

28:37.090 --> 28:41.208
It's not a movie, it's a war.

28:43.138 --> 28:44.878
Idiots.

28:50.145 --> 28:51.976
-l'm in the middle of something.
-I know.

28:52.147 --> 28:54.308
You can't come in here
when I'm in front of my people.

28:54.483 --> 28:55.814
I wanna talk to you about it.

28:55.984 --> 28:59.192
-How can I get them to respect me?
-We are supposed to be partners.

28:59.363 --> 29:02.275
-We are partners.
-Why does Gabe know more than I do?

29:02.449 --> 29:05.737
-I don't have time for this.
-You mean you don't have time for me.

29:06.453 --> 29:10.116
This is very valuable information, Gabe.
It's excellent work.

29:10.290 --> 29:12.747
I told both of you I don't care for this.

29:12.918 --> 29:14.829
You're going too darn far.

29:15.003 --> 29:17.494
Thank you, Reverend Newlin.
I'll put things in motion.

29:17.673 --> 29:18.708
Thanks.

29:18.882 --> 29:21.840
-You don't listen to me at all anymore.
-What?

29:22.010 --> 29:23.796
Jason.

29:24.763 --> 29:28.347
-You wanted me?
-Yes. You were fantastic today.

29:28.517 --> 29:30.257
Steve, he was such a warrior.

29:30.435 --> 29:33.142
So you said. I'm impressed.

29:33.313 --> 29:35.599
You're rising to the next level, recruit.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.856
I am? Well, what's that?

29:38.318 --> 29:40.695
Come take a little walk with me.

29:40.862 --> 29:42.853
-|'|| go too.
-We got it, honey.

29:43.198 --> 29:46.690
I'm going to show you something
that very few people have seen.

29:52.833 --> 29:54.869
Man to man?
Sometimes I almost understand...

29:55.043 --> 29:56.783
...why some people believe in divorce.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.702
-But you got Sarah.
-Yeah.

29:58.880 --> 30:01.337
I got her even when I don't want her.

30:01.717 --> 30:03.799
Oh, you know I'm just kidding.

30:03.969 --> 30:06.051
-All right, you ready?
-Yes, sir.

30:06.221 --> 30:09.839
Light of Day Institute
Research and Development.

30:10.475 --> 30:11.931
Holy sh--

30:12.102 --> 30:14.263
Holiness.

30:15.772 --> 30:19.515
Yeah. We're not exactly sure yet
of all the ways to take them out.

30:19.693 --> 30:21.729
At first, we just focused on the guns...

30:21.903 --> 30:24.895
...but then we thought,
"Well, hey, what's a wooden arrow?"

30:25.073 --> 30:26.938
Well, it's an itty-bitty stake.

30:27.117 --> 30:28.402
That's right, Jason.

30:28.577 --> 30:31.819
An itty-bitty stake to drive through
a vampire's dead, rotten heart...

30:31.997 --> 30:33.658
...at 324 feet per second.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.333
And that's all she wrote.

30:35.500 --> 30:36.956
I got silver bullets...

30:37.127 --> 30:39.664
...silver bullets with holy water,
wooden bullets.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.624
-We talked about those.
-Yes, sir.

30:41.798 --> 30:44.255
-A flamethrower.
-Whoa, man.

30:44.426 --> 30:46.041
Silver throwing stars.

30:46.928 --> 30:50.011
Now, that I wouldn't have thought of.

30:52.809 --> 30:54.060
Decapitation might work...

30:54.227 --> 30:58.095
...so we got a guillotine on order,
just in case.

30:58.273 --> 31:02.983
-What--?
-Oh, that's a machine like a giant razor.

31:03.153 --> 31:04.893
Cuts the heads right off.

31:06.740 --> 31:08.480
Yeah, I bet that'd do it, all right.

31:08.658 --> 31:11.900
There's one good thing about
having these hell beasts among us:

31:12.079 --> 31:15.162
We'll find better ways to kill them.

31:17.918 --> 31:20.830
-Amen.
-Amen.

31:26.635 --> 31:29.627
Keep it running. We're not going in.

31:46.363 --> 31:48.945
We gave our orders
to that other girl, twice.

31:49.116 --> 31:50.481
Sorry, she sucks.

31:50.659 --> 31:53.196
And what's with that fool bartender?
Where's our beers?

31:54.371 --> 31:55.531
Tara!

31:55.705 --> 31:58.321
You don't need any beers.
Your butt's as big as a barn.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.740
Well, you look like you're pregnant.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.911
-Nice of you to show up for work tonight.
-I said I was sorry.

32:04.089 --> 32:06.705
I would have got fired.
Lucky you slept with the boss.

32:07.634 --> 32:10.000
-Arlene.
-Tara, step up your game.

32:10.178 --> 32:11.338
We're way behind.

32:11.513 --> 32:13.754
Arlene, don't make me fire you
for talking trash.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.923
You be nice to her, Sam.
It's Tara's fault.

32:16.101 --> 32:18.262
-What's my fault?
-Sleeping where you eat.

32:18.979 --> 32:21.470
Jesus Christ, Terry,
what'd I ever do to you?

32:21.648 --> 32:24.014
You leave him alone.
And give me my beers.

32:24.192 --> 32:26.524
You know what? Here they are.

32:26.695 --> 32:28.435
-Fuck you very much.
-Fuck you too.

32:28.613 --> 32:31.525
Okay. I'm gonna go just get my--

32:32.033 --> 32:33.318
-Son of a--
-Go, Daphne.

32:33.493 --> 32:34.528
--bitch!

32:34.703 --> 32:37.319
Congratulations, Arlene.
You're Merlotte's best waitress.

32:37.497 --> 32:38.953
Frankly, I aim a little higher.

32:39.124 --> 32:41.957
Well, aim the plates for the tables.
That's all | ask.

32:42.127 --> 32:44.163
Hope l'm nicer to people
when I'm your age.

32:44.337 --> 32:46.328
Tara, how freaking long
do l have to wait...

32:46.506 --> 32:49.418
...for my 7 and 7, diet and rum,
two Scotches and a screwdriver?

32:49.593 --> 32:52.300
-You never gave me that.
-l was here. You weren't paying attention.

32:52.471 --> 32:55.554
-No, you weren't, and yes, l was.
-What's the holdup on my tequila?

32:55.724 --> 32:58.932
-You never asked me for tequi--
-You know, I think Tara's on drugs.

32:59.102 --> 33:00.137
Tara, you high?

33:00.312 --> 33:02.598
| wish I was,
the way everybody's dogging me.

33:02.772 --> 33:03.807
-Tara.
-Tara.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.017
-Tara.
-Tara.

33:05.192 --> 33:06.272
Tara.

33:06.443 --> 33:07.933
Fuck all of y'all!

33:11.823 --> 33:14.439
Lafayette, get out my way.

33:20.540 --> 33:22.451
We're done.

33:46.441 --> 33:49.604
Get on out of here. Bathtub's occupied.

33:51.613 --> 33:53.524
I know.

33:53.907 --> 33:55.693
Sarah?

33:57.619 --> 33:59.325
Did I stay too long?

33:59.496 --> 34:00.781
Do you want me to leave?

34:01.790 --> 34:03.872
Please don't.

34:12.384 --> 34:13.590
I'll help you.

35:01.182 --> 35:05.050
Mary Magdalene washed
the feet of Jesus...

35:06.021 --> 35:08.603
...and dried them with her hair.

35:10.525 --> 35:12.561
Isn't that lovely?

35:13.945 --> 35:15.446
Yeah.

35:16.531 --> 35:21.821
But wasn't she, like, a hooker?

35:22.746 --> 35:25.237
She was not.

35:27.751 --> 35:30.413
Everybody thinks so...

35:31.087 --> 35:32.543
...but that's not in the Bible.

35:38.136 --> 35:41.094
She admired Jesus.

35:43.224 --> 35:45.306
She loved him.

35:48.229 --> 35:50.060
And she wanted to show him.

35:59.866 --> 36:00.901
No.

36:02.243 --> 36:03.574
You don't mean it.

36:04.120 --> 36:08.454
No, I don't, but I ought to.

36:09.876 --> 36:11.741
Do you know what I think?

36:16.675 --> 36:19.291
I think that after all your trials...

36:20.595 --> 36:23.507
...heartache and pain...

36:25.767 --> 36:28.554
...God wants you to have a reward.

36:29.396 --> 36:31.057
Are you sure?

36:34.192 --> 36:38.401
Let me reward you, Jason.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.947
Let me help you find your way
backtojoy.

37:00.468 --> 37:03.676
We take them all out at once.
Pre-emptive strike.

37:03.847 --> 37:07.339
Of course, so the federal government
can bomb us back into the Middle Ages.

37:07.517 --> 37:08.632
Things were better then.

37:08.810 --> 37:11.893
Then go to Romania and live
in a cave, you ranchero poser.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.142
Godric has protected you...

37:15.316 --> 37:18.183
...made you rich, and you stand here
spitting and scratching like infants.

37:18.361 --> 37:20.773
Don't you care
that there's a traitor in your midst?

37:20.947 --> 37:22.312
-No.
-lmpossible.

37:22.490 --> 37:24.526
Somebody tried to kidnap me
from the airport.

37:24.701 --> 37:27.033
You were the only ones
that knew she was coming.

37:27.203 --> 37:28.864
Explain.

37:29.038 --> 37:31.120
-Unless it was you.
-Unless it was you.

37:31.291 --> 37:33.623
If y'all argue anymore,
l'll fall asleep or scream...

37:33.793 --> 37:35.909
...so this is what we're gonna do:

37:36.546 --> 37:39.083
l'll infiltrate the Fellowship of the Sun.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.372
Absolutely not.

37:40.550 --> 37:42.086
Let her speak.

37:42.886 --> 37:45.298
Bill glamoured the kidnapper,
no one knows who I am.

37:45.472 --> 37:47.804
l'll join the church,
check out their thoughts.

37:47.974 --> 37:50.340
No. During the day,
none of us can help you.

37:50.518 --> 37:53.385
lt'll only take a little while.
Really, Bill. It's simple.

37:54.647 --> 37:56.979
Waste of time...

37:58.318 --> 38:00.525
...when we could drink them all.

38:01.029 --> 38:03.520
I want no part of this.

38:05.158 --> 38:07.444
There's no easier way to find out
if they're involved.

38:07.619 --> 38:10.031
If it leads us to Godric, we'll do it.

38:10.205 --> 38:11.411
The decision is made.

38:15.043 --> 38:16.123
A few words.

38:25.595 --> 38:30.180
So tell me, how goes your
human-vampire relationship?

38:35.730 --> 38:38.062
You knew it would come to this.

38:38.608 --> 38:40.223
She was just clawed and poisoned...

38:40.401 --> 38:42.858
...by a creature we don't know
and we can't find...

38:43.029 --> 38:45.395
...and now, in Dallas,
you're playing with her life.

38:45.573 --> 38:47.689
It's no game to me.

38:48.284 --> 38:50.240
All this for a colleague?

38:50.411 --> 38:52.538
For the sheriff of Area 9?

38:52.705 --> 38:54.081
Why?

39:11.724 --> 39:14.010
Go on.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.765
I'm finished.

39:20.108 --> 39:22.224
Go on.

39:22.986 --> 39:25.147
No.

39:25.822 --> 39:26.777
Eric...

39:28.324 --> 39:32.237
...you saved our lives a hundred times.

39:34.330 --> 39:36.366
We won't leave you to be eaten by wolves.

39:36.875 --> 39:39.617
We'll wait for the end by your side.

39:40.461 --> 39:42.952
We'll give you a hero's farewell.

39:44.048 --> 39:47.211
The gods wait for you in Valhalla.

39:47.677 --> 39:51.044
There will be a party with meat...

39:51.472 --> 39:53.884
...and gold and beer.

39:55.393 --> 39:58.305
And women? Will there be women?

40:00.690 --> 40:04.148
Wherever I am...

40:05.528 --> 40:07.564
...there will always be women.

40:44.317 --> 40:46.103
All Will be well.

40:48.363 --> 40:50.274
Don't be afraid.

40:50.865 --> 40:53.356
I'm not afraid.

40:54.827 --> 40:56.203
l'm pissed off.

40:59.207 --> 41:00.071
Who's there?

41:05.171 --> 41:06.206
Show yourself!

41:19.477 --> 41:21.889
Are you Death?

41:23.773 --> 41:26.230
lam.

41:27.568 --> 41:30.275
But you're just a little boy.

41:31.197 --> 41:34.155
I'm not.

41:34.575 --> 41:36.111
My men....

41:36.285 --> 41:38.412
Dead.

41:38.955 --> 41:42.413
You swine.

41:46.212 --> 41:50.080
I watched you on the battlefield last night.

41:50.925 --> 41:54.588
I never saw anyone fight like you.

41:56.931 --> 42:00.173
I would fight you now if I could.

42:02.562 --> 42:05.599
I know.

42:06.733 --> 42:09.190
It's beautiful.

42:11.988 --> 42:14.195
What are you waiting for?

42:14.949 --> 42:16.610
Kill me.

42:21.039 --> 42:25.203
Could you be a companion of Death?

42:25.710 --> 42:29.453
Could you walk with me
through the world...

42:29.922 --> 42:31.537
...through the dark?

42:32.508 --> 42:34.794
l'll teach you all I know.

42:36.846 --> 42:40.213
I'll be your father...

42:40.391 --> 42:45.977
...your brother, your child.

42:49.275 --> 42:52.483
What's in it for me?

42:55.406 --> 43:00.446
What you love most: Life.

43:02.747 --> 43:04.487
Life.

43:21.766 --> 43:24.098
Godric is my maker.

43:45.706 --> 43:47.958
Thanks for helping me close.

43:48.126 --> 43:49.832
Oh, yeah.

43:50.711 --> 43:54.795
I broke a lot of things today.
It's the least I can do.

43:54.966 --> 43:57.958
Well, I'm sure you'll make it up to me.

43:58.136 --> 44:00.422
I'm sure I will.

44:05.059 --> 44:09.052
Nice. You run a little hot.

44:09.230 --> 44:10.845
Yeah.

44:11.023 --> 44:16.563
Everybody else is 98.6,
but I'm always around 100, 101.

44:17.071 --> 44:20.484
Me too. It's a shifter thing.

44:20.658 --> 44:23.195
Yeah? I never knew.

44:25.246 --> 44:28.659
I can't believe I'm the first one
you've ever met.

44:28.833 --> 44:32.746
I mean, we're not common,
but we are out there.

44:34.046 --> 44:35.877
Ran into a few werewolves...

44:37.091 --> 44:39.924
...but nobody like us.

44:43.181 --> 44:46.298
What's it feel like when you change?

44:49.770 --> 44:54.935
Like sparks running all over my skin.

44:55.109 --> 44:57.475
Used to scare the shit out of me.

44:58.070 --> 45:00.106
Me too.

45:00.281 --> 45:02.567
But now it just feels awesome.

45:02.742 --> 45:05.449
Yeah, and there's--
There's sort of a build...

45:05.620 --> 45:08.453
...like a pressure.

45:09.874 --> 45:12.035
Where does it start?

45:15.504 --> 45:17.165
Here?

45:17.840 --> 45:21.879
Maybe--? Maybe here?

45:24.388 --> 45:26.049
Probably here, isn't it?

45:26.224 --> 45:27.589
That's where it hits me.

45:27.767 --> 45:31.476
Yeah, that's it, right about there.

45:32.396 --> 45:35.684
Sparks start flying inside too.

45:39.111 --> 45:43.104
And you feel all lit up
like a broke power cable.

45:43.282 --> 45:45.238
Or a Christmas tree.

45:45.409 --> 45:50.028
And you just explode.

46:18.484 --> 46:21.191
Well, are you gonna say it or should I?

46:21.362 --> 46:23.227
Say what?

46:24.323 --> 46:26.359
Nice rack.

46:27.702 --> 46:30.068
Nice balls.

46:38.212 --> 46:41.375
l have to ask a question. Human stuff.

46:41.549 --> 46:44.040
I'll wait for you at the elevator.

46:51.767 --> 46:55.134
Excuse me,
is Barry the bellboy working tonight?

46:55.313 --> 46:57.349
No, I'm sorry. Barry quit today.

46:57.523 --> 46:58.603
What?

47:01.110 --> 47:03.726
Oh, shoot.

47:05.406 --> 47:06.987
Thanks.

47:18.002 --> 47:20.209
Are you waiting up for me?

47:22.840 --> 47:25.252
I guess I am.

47:33.517 --> 47:35.053
Rough night?

47:36.187 --> 47:38.473
Really rough.

47:40.941 --> 47:43.398
We looked at houses today.
We didn't find anything...

47:43.569 --> 47:46.436
...but don't worry,
we'll be out by morning.

47:46.614 --> 47:49.981
I filled the fridge with your favorite things,
and I made you dinner.

47:52.453 --> 47:54.364
Dontgo.

47:55.289 --> 47:59.999
I'll call Sookie. I want you to stay.

48:00.628 --> 48:03.040
You're so good to me.

48:11.472 --> 48:13.929
You know why I'm good to you?

48:18.312 --> 48:21.145
Because you need it so much.

48:21.482 --> 48:24.974
And because it makes you bloom
like a flower.

48:38.249 --> 48:39.955
Look at you.

48:40.126 --> 48:41.411
King of Sheba.

48:41.752 --> 48:43.663
Hey, baby.

48:54.515 --> 48:57.348
You saw them in the lair tonight.

48:58.060 --> 49:00.016
Despicable.

49:00.729 --> 49:04.062
Vicious, petty, vile creatures.

49:04.525 --> 49:05.856
You're different.

49:06.360 --> 49:08.942
You're not like them.

49:09.113 --> 49:11.069
Bill, you're not.

49:11.866 --> 49:16.701
You have a heart,
whether it beats or not.

49:17.246 --> 49:18.907
You can love.

49:19.081 --> 49:22.619
There wasn't one other vampire there
that could say the same.

49:24.086 --> 49:27.544
Let's slip away
back to Bon Temps right now.

49:28.424 --> 49:31.632
Let them devour each other
and leave us alone.

49:31.802 --> 49:34.088
You know we can't do that.

49:34.263 --> 49:40.680
Stan's as nutty as a fruitcake,
and I gave my word to Eric.

49:45.399 --> 49:47.685
If anything happens to you
in that church, |--

49:47.860 --> 49:49.691
Don't say it.

49:49.862 --> 49:52.444
Don't even think it.

49:53.574 --> 49:57.317
I'll be in and out, easy-peasy.

50:00.164 --> 50:02.496
Oh, Bill.

50:13.177 --> 50:15.384
It's been a long night.

50:16.096 --> 50:18.587
Don't feel like you have to.

50:18.766 --> 50:21.303
Quit talking crazy.

50:22.394 --> 50:28.230
| just meant that I'd be satisfied
to simply hold you.

50:28.776 --> 50:31.643
Well, I would not be satisfied.

50:32.446 --> 50:34.437
Not one bit.

50:37.159 --> 50:40.026
Then what do you want, Sookie?

50:41.288 --> 50:42.903
Say it.

50:43.624 --> 50:46.411
I want you.

50:47.461 --> 50:49.918
Every which way.

50:51.382 --> 50:56.342
| just want you.

51:35.509 --> 51:37.670
Oh, Bill.
