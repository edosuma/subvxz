WEBVTT

00:02.864 --> 00:05.100
Right now,
we're offering 450.

00:05.133 --> 00:07.302
They're holding out
for six and a quarter.

00:07.335 --> 00:10.305
You're prepared to go to trial
over $175,000?

00:10.338 --> 00:11.372
We have to.

00:11.406 --> 00:13.474
The insurance industry
as a whole is taking a hit

00:13.508 --> 00:15.676
because we're paying out
too much in damage claims.

00:15.711 --> 00:18.413
We're now perceived
as being soft,

00:18.446 --> 00:20.481
and the truth is,
we have to be seen
as ready to litigate.

00:20.515 --> 00:22.683
But what about
these big jury awards?

00:22.718 --> 00:23.819
That doesn't scare you?

00:23.852 --> 00:26.021
Oh, it does, but it means
that we can't be satisfied

00:26.054 --> 00:28.656
with just going to trial.
We have to win.

00:28.689 --> 00:30.658
BOBBY: And this
starts tomorrow.

00:30.691 --> 00:34.162
Yes, but the reality is
if the plaintiff sees us

00:34.195 --> 00:36.131
bringing you guys on
last-minute,

00:36.164 --> 00:38.599
they'll realize that we're
serious about going to trial,

00:38.633 --> 00:40.635
and we truly think
that they'll settle.

00:40.668 --> 00:43.371
We're primarily criminal,
Gordon, not civil.

00:43.404 --> 00:47.743
Understood, but we are gonna
draw a very blue-collar jury,

00:47.776 --> 00:49.610
which is why
we want you, Mr. Berluti.

00:49.644 --> 00:52.047
And, Mr. Young,
no disrespect
to your talent,

00:52.080 --> 00:53.181
which we know
is enormous--

00:53.214 --> 00:55.450
the plaintiff
is African-American,

00:55.483 --> 00:57.652
as are
several of the jurors.

00:57.685 --> 01:00.055
Now, we don't anticipate
any bias,

01:00.088 --> 01:01.723
but we want
that to be covered,

01:01.757 --> 01:04.659
so we want you
to do the plaintiff's cross.

01:04.691 --> 01:07.128
Now, I have a videotape
of his deposition,

01:07.162 --> 01:09.397
which I'll leave
for you to watch.

01:09.430 --> 01:11.700
But like I said,
with you alongside,

01:11.733 --> 01:14.135
perhaps that will
push the plaintiffs to settle.

01:14.169 --> 01:15.871
We're so close as it is.

01:15.904 --> 01:18.573
The plaintiff is poor,
working-class?

01:18.606 --> 01:22.443
The plaintiff is
ten years old.

01:22.477 --> 01:24.846
Our client ran him over
with his SUV.

01:28.216 --> 01:29.818
But he survived.

01:29.851 --> 01:32.520
Oh, yes. That's why
they're holding out
for six and a quarter.

01:32.553 --> 01:34.823
If he'd died,
I think that we could have
settled for three.

01:39.160 --> 01:42.197
I'm sorry.
That perhaps sounded cold.

01:43.064 --> 01:44.665
Perhaps.

01:48.603 --> 01:51.239
(music playing)

02:37.418 --> 02:39.988
GORDON: Your brother
is older or younger?

02:40.021 --> 02:43.058
BOY: Well, I have two brothers.

02:43.091 --> 02:45.526
One's older--
that's Kenny.

02:45.560 --> 02:47.662
Then I also have
a baby brother.

02:47.695 --> 02:49.164
His name is Justin.

02:49.197 --> 02:51.466
And the one that I go
to school with is Kenny.

02:51.499 --> 02:52.600
(switches off)

02:57.538 --> 03:00.308
All set?
Ready. Let's go.

03:03.478 --> 03:05.380
We'll call in,
let you know.

03:05.413 --> 03:06.181
Good luck.

03:06.214 --> 03:08.917
So they didn't settle
after all?

03:08.950 --> 03:11.286
The plaintiff came down to six,
but that was it.

03:11.319 --> 03:14.189
Is this our new direction--
insurance defense?

03:14.222 --> 03:16.124
No, but civil law is something
you all want to do,

03:16.157 --> 03:17.125
and this is a good in.

03:17.158 --> 03:19.394
Right now our civil profile
is nonexistent.

03:19.427 --> 03:22.163
Which is unfortunate,
because I'd love to buy a house.

03:22.197 --> 03:23.164
Me, too.

03:28.536 --> 03:32.173
I was walking home from school
when I got to the corner.

03:32.207 --> 03:34.275
Pembleton and Columbus?

03:35.176 --> 03:38.546
Yes, and I waited
till the sign said "walk."

03:38.579 --> 03:40.448
So I started to cross.

03:40.481 --> 03:41.850
Then I saw it.

03:41.883 --> 03:43.819
Saw what?
The car.

03:43.852 --> 03:46.321
It was coming so fast.

03:46.354 --> 03:49.157
I turned to look,
but it was too late.

03:49.190 --> 03:51.659
Before I could even move,
it had hit me.

03:51.692 --> 03:54.796
Could you see
who was driving the car?

03:54.830 --> 03:57.699
Only that it was a man,
and he was wearing a suit,

03:57.733 --> 03:59.367
like a business suit.

03:59.400 --> 04:01.302
Did you see
anything else?

04:01.336 --> 04:03.772
I saw he was looking down
where a phone would be,

04:03.805 --> 04:05.774
and he wasn't looking
at where he was driving.

04:05.807 --> 04:06.808
Objection.

04:06.842 --> 04:08.977
Overruled.
It's his observation.

04:10.378 --> 04:12.781
Can you tell the jury
about your injuries?

04:12.814 --> 04:15.450
I had broken ribs,

04:15.483 --> 04:16.952
my lungs was hurt,

04:16.985 --> 04:19.320
my arm was broken,

04:19.353 --> 04:21.089
my head was hurt,

04:21.122 --> 04:24.259
and a bone was broken
in my shin.

04:24.292 --> 04:27.395
Have you had any other problems
besides broken bones?

04:27.428 --> 04:28.930
I can't learn.

04:29.965 --> 04:31.532
You can't learn?

04:31.566 --> 04:34.936
I don't remember anything
that they teach me at school.

04:36.237 --> 04:38.206
Could you
before the accident?

04:38.239 --> 04:39.875
Yes.

04:39.908 --> 04:40.876
And you've talked
to the doctors

04:40.909 --> 04:42.410
about these problems
you've had learning.

04:42.443 --> 04:43.745
Yes.

04:43.779 --> 04:45.146
Did they tell you
whether or not

04:45.180 --> 04:46.882
these problems
would ever go away?

04:46.915 --> 04:49.050
They don't think they will.

04:50.051 --> 04:51.219
Thank you, Jason.

04:51.252 --> 04:53.288
Right now,
another lawyer is going

04:53.321 --> 04:55.290
to ask you
a few questions, okay?

04:55.323 --> 04:56.457
Okay.

05:04.365 --> 05:05.701
Hi, Jason.

05:05.734 --> 05:09.304
I'm Eugene Young,
and as Ms. Turner said,

05:09.337 --> 05:11.306
I'll be asking you
a few questions.

05:11.339 --> 05:13.574
If at any time
you need a break,

05:13.608 --> 05:16.044
you just tell me, okay?
Okay.

05:17.478 --> 05:21.249
First, let me say how sorry
I am that you got hurt,

05:21.282 --> 05:22.650
and that I hope
you get better.

05:22.683 --> 05:24.252
Thank you.

05:24.285 --> 05:27.823
You said you were walking home
from school that day, right?

05:27.856 --> 05:29.690
Yes.
At the corner,

05:29.725 --> 05:33.028
you said you waited
for the sign to say "walk."

05:33.061 --> 05:34.495
I did.

05:34.529 --> 05:37.632
There was a witness, Jason--
a Mr. Anthony Walker.

05:37.665 --> 05:40.268
And he said upon hearing
the impact, he looked up,

05:40.301 --> 05:42.037
and he said he noticed

05:42.070 --> 05:44.605
the light was flashing
"don't walk."

05:44.639 --> 05:47.976
Well, it said "walk"
when I started to walk.

05:48.009 --> 05:50.779
Sometimes it changes
when you're halfway across.

05:50.812 --> 05:52.781
Were you halfway across?

05:56.451 --> 05:58.353
According
to the police investigators,

05:58.386 --> 06:02.023
you got hit when you were
about ten feet from the curb.

06:02.057 --> 06:04.425
So that would mean that
the light changed to "walk,"

06:04.459 --> 06:06.394
you walked ten feet,

06:06.427 --> 06:08.196
and then it changed to
"don't walk."

06:08.229 --> 06:09.430
Is that what happened?

06:10.331 --> 06:11.599
I don't know.

06:11.632 --> 06:13.802
Is it possible
that when you got to the curb,

06:13.835 --> 06:16.171
you looked up, saw "walk,"
then walked?

06:18.139 --> 06:19.607
That's what I said.

06:19.640 --> 06:22.077
Well, actually, you said

06:22.110 --> 06:24.212
you waited for it
to change to "walk,"

06:24.245 --> 06:25.613
and that's where
I'm having difficulty.

06:25.646 --> 06:28.483
Now, if it had already
been flashing "walk"

06:28.516 --> 06:29.818
when you arrived
at the corner,

06:29.851 --> 06:32.487
then I can see how you might
only get ten feet or so.

06:32.520 --> 06:35.791
Could it have
already been on "walk"

06:35.824 --> 06:38.026
when you arrived
at the corner, Jason?

06:39.660 --> 06:44.165
Maybe. All I know is that
it said "walk," and I walked.

06:46.234 --> 06:48.469
You said
after the accident,

06:48.503 --> 06:50.939
you've been having trouble
remembering things, right?

06:50.972 --> 06:52.273
Yes.

06:54.075 --> 06:57.212
Jason, truthfully...

06:58.579 --> 07:02.117
...do you have a little trouble
remembering the accident itself?

07:06.187 --> 07:08.323
When you woke up
after the accident,

07:08.356 --> 07:10.759
and the police
asked you what happened,

07:10.792 --> 07:12.060
did you remember?

07:13.128 --> 07:14.562
Not right away.

07:15.430 --> 07:17.498
Well, how long
after the accident

07:17.532 --> 07:19.467
did you start to remember?

07:22.971 --> 07:24.305
It took a long time.

07:42.123 --> 07:44.926
What, you're still
expecting me to blink?

07:44.960 --> 07:48.463
Audrey, the boy's memory
is suspect.

07:48.496 --> 07:50.631
No skid marks, Gordon,
middle of the street.

07:50.665 --> 07:52.533
But if he dashed--
Nobody saw him dash,

07:52.567 --> 07:54.602
least of all your client,
who was trying to place a call.

07:54.635 --> 07:56.938
The one and only witness saw
"don't walk."

07:56.972 --> 07:59.440
How many times have we had
this give and take?

07:59.474 --> 08:01.877
Many times, but I'm the only one
who seems to be giving.

08:01.910 --> 08:03.845
You haven't--
Four-fifty for a boy

08:03.879 --> 08:05.981
with permanent
learning disabilities.

08:06.014 --> 08:08.216
My doctors say it most likely
isn't permanent.

08:08.249 --> 08:10.551
The truth is it'll be years
before we know.

08:10.585 --> 08:14.790
I am putting an extra 200
on the table for it now,

08:14.823 --> 08:17.058
and all this assumes
that you can make on liability,

08:17.092 --> 08:18.459
which is not a lock.

08:18.493 --> 08:20.729
I'm not taking 450.

08:22.798 --> 08:24.399
Why don't we split
the difference and go home:

08:24.432 --> 08:25.967
Five and a quarter.
Five-fifty.

08:26.001 --> 08:27.602
Five twenty-five.

08:27.635 --> 08:28.904
I know
you've done the numbers.

08:28.937 --> 08:31.840
It's a good offer,
and it's final.

08:34.609 --> 08:35.876
Yea or nay?

08:39.514 --> 08:41.416
I'll discuss it
with the family.

08:51.526 --> 08:53.628
(door opens)
How'd it go?

08:54.395 --> 08:55.764
Eugene was good.

08:55.797 --> 08:57.999
Gentle, but he caught
some discrepancies.

08:58.033 --> 09:00.468
I don't think the boy
really remembers the accident.

09:00.501 --> 09:01.469
Eight and a half
at the time.

09:01.502 --> 09:03.238
Well, there's
another offer out.

09:03.271 --> 09:04.740
The feeling is
they'll grab it.

09:06.407 --> 09:07.408
Can I help you?

09:07.442 --> 09:10.912
Yes, I'm looking
for Gordon Keene.

09:10.946 --> 09:12.247
I was told
he might be here.

09:12.280 --> 09:15.150
No, we just left him.
I think, uh...

09:15.183 --> 09:16.718
he's on his way home.

09:16.752 --> 09:18.319
I'm Dr. Harold Manning,

09:18.353 --> 09:21.456
Vice President
of Medical Affairs
for Brenford Mutual.

09:21.489 --> 09:24.292
This firm, I understand,
is on the Jason Lees case.

09:24.325 --> 09:25.894
Yes.

09:26.862 --> 09:28.696
Could we go somewhere
and talk?

09:31.800 --> 09:34.469
I've worked for Brenford Mutual
for almost 20 years.

09:34.502 --> 09:36.471
I review files,
medical histories,

09:36.504 --> 09:38.907
in part to be sure
they're not being defrauded.

09:38.940 --> 09:41.009
You think the boy's injuries
may be a fraud?

09:41.042 --> 09:43.211
No, certainly not.

09:43.244 --> 09:45.847
Everything listed
in the complaint is real.

09:45.881 --> 09:47.783
It's what isn't listed.

09:48.683 --> 09:50.852
I'm not sure
I follow, doctor.

09:50.886 --> 09:53.254
This afternoon,
in preparing for the case,

09:53.288 --> 09:55.924
one of our staff physicians
went back over the file

09:55.957 --> 09:57.759
along with
all the X-rays.

09:57.793 --> 09:59.861
He saw something
on the MRI--

09:59.895 --> 10:02.497
a tiny marking
at the base of the brain.

10:02.530 --> 10:04.032
He had me look at it.

10:04.065 --> 10:06.101
At first I assumed
it was minor bleeding.

10:06.134 --> 10:08.569
We often see that
in this kind of trauma.

10:08.603 --> 10:10.071
But I looked closer.

10:10.105 --> 10:12.307
You think
it may be more serious?

10:12.340 --> 10:13.875
I'm certain it is.

10:13.909 --> 10:17.612
Mr. Lees has a dissecting
aneurysm of the basilar artery.

10:20.648 --> 10:23.151
A small tear
in the lining of the artery.

10:23.184 --> 10:26.187
In time, that tear will
likely get progressively worse,

10:26.221 --> 10:28.757
until eventually,
the wall of the vessel ruptures.

10:28.790 --> 10:30.525
What are the chances
that'll happen?

10:30.558 --> 10:33.028
It will happen.
The question is when.

10:33.061 --> 10:35.530
Maybe today,
maybe ten years from now.

10:35.563 --> 10:38.399
Without immediate surgery
to repair the damage,

10:38.433 --> 10:41.870
his life is
at significant risk.

10:41.903 --> 10:43.271
Wait a second.

10:43.304 --> 10:46.207
Jason Lees has a team
of treating physicians.

10:46.241 --> 10:47.976
I have to believe
they're aware of this.

10:48.009 --> 10:49.110
If they were
aware of this,

10:49.144 --> 10:50.611
the boy would have
been rushed into surgery.

10:50.645 --> 10:52.347
His doctors
obviously missed it.

10:52.380 --> 10:54.249
We missed it
until today.

10:55.583 --> 10:57.719
Have you notified his family
or his doctors?

10:57.753 --> 10:59.020
I can't.

10:59.054 --> 11:00.588
As an officer
of the company,

11:00.621 --> 11:02.523
I have a fiduciary duty
to Brenford Mutual.

11:02.557 --> 11:05.560
I cannot disclose
if it's against their interest.

11:05.593 --> 11:07.695
So they don't even know.
No, they don't.

11:07.729 --> 11:10.431
What about Gordon Keene?
Does he know about this?

11:10.465 --> 11:12.167
No, that's why I've come
looking for him.

11:12.200 --> 11:13.368
I couldn't get him
on his cell.

11:13.401 --> 11:16.471
What you're telling us,
doctor--

11:16.504 --> 11:18.940
that boy's life
is in immediate danger.

11:20.041 --> 11:22.177
That's exactly
what I'm telling you.

11:35.791 --> 11:37.358
I just got off
with Dr. Scanlon.

11:37.392 --> 11:39.160
He agrees-- aneurysm.

11:39.194 --> 11:41.696
Okay, whatever they counter
tomorrow,

11:41.730 --> 11:43.064
we'll accept it.

11:43.098 --> 11:45.500
Then we'll get the settlement
entered immediately.

11:45.533 --> 11:48.536
Tomorrow? That kid
is in danger tonight.

11:48.569 --> 11:50.371
We can't get a settlement
entered tonight, Jimmy.

11:50.405 --> 11:51.539
So what?

11:51.572 --> 11:53.308
Gordon--
I hear you, Bobby.

11:53.341 --> 11:56.611
But the client has instructed me
to get the case settled.

11:56.644 --> 11:58.613
If that aneurysm
bursts tonight,

11:58.646 --> 12:01.116
Brenford Mutual will be
on the hook for ten times--

12:01.149 --> 12:03.484
Well, they're willing
to run the risk, evidently.

12:03.518 --> 12:05.553
I'm not.
That's not your call.

12:05.586 --> 12:07.522
This is privileged.
It's work product.

12:07.555 --> 12:10.058
We can't let a kid die.
Come on.

12:10.091 --> 12:11.626
We are gonna
settle this thing

12:11.659 --> 12:12.861
and then enter it.

12:12.894 --> 12:14.629
Then they'll just try
to void it on fraud

12:14.662 --> 12:15.731
as soon as we tell them.

12:15.764 --> 12:17.165
Did you advise
the client of that?

12:17.198 --> 12:18.333
I did.

12:18.366 --> 12:19.735
And?

12:20.702 --> 12:22.170
The client
doesn't want us to tell

12:22.203 --> 12:24.339
even after the settlement.

12:34.215 --> 12:36.284
You got to be kidding me.

12:36.317 --> 12:37.585
Bobby...

12:38.553 --> 12:41.222
Brenford Mutual
is hemorrhaging,

12:41.256 --> 12:42.858
if you'll pardon
the terrible pun.

12:43.859 --> 12:46.762
If it gets out that
that kid has an aneurysm,

12:46.795 --> 12:48.730
it's a multimillion-dollar
verdict

12:48.764 --> 12:50.598
even if they're able
to repair it.

12:50.631 --> 12:52.433
And if it should come out
that we knew

12:52.467 --> 12:54.135
about that aneurysm
and we didn't tell--

12:55.203 --> 12:58.606
The public relations alone...
That's sick.

12:58.639 --> 12:59.775
There's got to be
a way around this.

12:59.808 --> 13:00.608
There isn't.

13:01.609 --> 13:03.311
The client has given us
the instruction.

13:03.344 --> 13:07.983
We are ethically prohibited
from revealing this information.

13:11.119 --> 13:14.455
Now, look, I don't like this
any more than you do, but...

13:18.860 --> 13:20.395
I'll take it from here.

13:20.428 --> 13:22.798
I'll get this thing
settled in the morning.

13:25.666 --> 13:26.835
Thanks.

13:29.871 --> 13:31.306
(door opens)

13:32.708 --> 13:33.674
(door closes)

13:33.709 --> 13:35.744
We're just going
to sit on this?

13:37.012 --> 13:38.780
Lucy, get me
Anderson Pearson.

13:46.021 --> 13:47.756
I'm afraid
Gordon Keene is right.

13:47.789 --> 13:49.958
He can't be.
If we know a client

13:49.991 --> 13:52.260
is about to cause
serious bodily harm,

13:52.293 --> 13:53.995
we're allowed to tell.

13:54.029 --> 13:56.664
No. That is different
from knowing somebody's
medical condition

13:56.698 --> 13:57.999
as a part of work product.

13:58.033 --> 14:00.001
Why? why should it
be any different?

14:00.035 --> 14:01.770
In both instances,
we have knowledge

14:01.803 --> 14:03.504
somebody's about
to get hurt.

14:03.538 --> 14:05.941
Perhaps that distinction
is a ludicrous one, Bobby,

14:05.974 --> 14:08.143
but currently,
the law makes that distinction.

14:08.176 --> 14:11.546
If you know your client
is about to commit a crime

14:11.579 --> 14:14.382
and cause bodily injury,
you are permitted to tell.

14:14.415 --> 14:17.052
But a medical condition
in a civil matter--

14:17.085 --> 14:18.619
unless you get
the client's permission,

14:18.653 --> 14:19.955
you are frozen.

14:22.858 --> 14:24.726
Can't you get the client
to move on this?

14:24.760 --> 14:25.827
No.

14:31.632 --> 14:33.668
All I can think of--
after we settle the case,

14:33.702 --> 14:35.536
the client
might be less panicked.

14:35.570 --> 14:37.973
Maybe then we can
convince them to tell.

14:38.006 --> 14:40.208
But as Keene said,
the risk there is so great.

14:40.241 --> 14:42.010
Well, I can't think
of anything else, can you?

14:43.779 --> 14:45.280
Jimmy?

14:49.117 --> 14:50.752
Jimmy? Any ideas?

14:51.486 --> 14:52.821
No.

14:54.823 --> 14:56.691
(sighs) Where are you
in the trial?

14:56.725 --> 14:58.493
Well, it's obviously
going to settle now.

14:58.526 --> 15:00.328
But if for some reason
it doesn't,

15:00.361 --> 15:02.063
are you ready
with your closing, Jimmy?

15:03.464 --> 15:04.299
Jimmy!

15:04.332 --> 15:06.702
Is your closing ready?

15:07.903 --> 15:10.238
I was gonna head back
to work on it now.

15:10.271 --> 15:11.873
I don't think we'd get there
tomorrow, but--

15:11.907 --> 15:13.709
You've got to stay focused.

15:13.742 --> 15:16.077
I'll be ready,
if need be.

15:51.713 --> 15:53.414
GORDON (on tape): Any sisters?

15:53.448 --> 15:56.785
No sisters.
Just me and my two brothers.

15:56.818 --> 15:58.920
My parents wanted a girl
when they had me.

15:58.954 --> 16:01.890
At least that's what
my older brother tells me.

16:01.923 --> 16:03.624
He says that to punk me.

16:03.658 --> 16:05.093
He punks me all the time.

16:55.243 --> 16:56.878
(rings doorbell)

17:04.419 --> 17:06.320
Mr. Lees, my name
is James Berluti.

17:06.354 --> 17:09.089
I'm one of the lawyers
representing Branford Mutual.

17:09.124 --> 17:10.558
Yeah, I recognize you.

17:10.590 --> 17:12.693
I'm sorry
to bother you this late.

17:13.594 --> 17:14.796
Your son...

17:19.134 --> 17:22.170
your son has an aneurysm
at the base of his skull.

17:23.238 --> 17:24.873
What?

17:24.906 --> 17:26.907
Our doctors reviewed
his MRI today.

17:26.942 --> 17:29.477
I've called an ambulance.
It's on the way.

17:31.079 --> 17:32.247
There's been a misdiagnosis.

17:32.280 --> 17:34.049
Your son could be in danger.

17:36.384 --> 17:38.519
We need to get him
to a hospital.

17:38.553 --> 17:39.520
Where is he now?

17:39.554 --> 17:41.389
He's in bed.

17:41.422 --> 17:42.891
You need to get him up.

17:42.924 --> 17:45.126
(siren approaching)

17:45.160 --> 17:48.663
Mr. Lees, you need
to get your son out of bed.

17:50.932 --> 17:52.000
MEDIC: You got him?

17:52.033 --> 17:54.035
(indistinct radio chatter)

17:54.069 --> 17:55.503
It's just a precaution,
sweetheart.

17:55.536 --> 17:56.705
You're gonna be fine.

17:56.738 --> 17:58.039
You're gonna be fine.

18:14.355 --> 18:15.423
Jimmy.

18:17.525 --> 18:19.394
Dr. Manning was right.

18:19.427 --> 18:21.262
The boy went into surgery
a couple hours ago.

18:21.296 --> 18:23.799
Well, did--
did anything happen?

18:23.832 --> 18:24.800
No.

18:25.901 --> 18:27.135
I told them.

18:28.336 --> 18:29.637
You told them?

18:39.447 --> 18:40.916
Jimmy informed the parents.

18:40.949 --> 18:42.450
The boy is in surgery.

18:43.752 --> 18:45.320
Are you out of your mind?

18:45.353 --> 18:48.289
Yeah, I am.

18:48.323 --> 18:50.726
And you can go tell
your client, Mr. Keene,

18:50.759 --> 18:52.961
if they want to report me
to the Bar, go ahead.

18:52.994 --> 18:55.864
But like you said,
the negative publicity
will destroy them,

18:55.897 --> 18:58.199
and I'll make plenty of noise,
trust me.

18:58.233 --> 19:00.969
Is that all you thought about,
Jimmy, being disbarred?

19:01.002 --> 19:02.838
You personally
and your firm

19:02.871 --> 19:04.706
will be on the hook
for any damage award

19:04.740 --> 19:06.708
above $550,000,
you think about that?

19:06.742 --> 19:09.410
I wasn't gonna
let that kid die.

19:18.086 --> 19:19.687
We removed the aneurysm,

19:19.721 --> 19:21.489
clipped it
without complications.

19:21.522 --> 19:22.657
He's gonna be fine.

19:26.227 --> 19:27.495
(crying)

19:42.711 --> 19:44.645
Could they tell whether
it was about to burst or not?

19:44.679 --> 19:46.414
Not really,
but it was dangerous enough

19:46.447 --> 19:48.183
that they had to operate
right away.

19:48.216 --> 19:49.584
Was there any bleeding
in the brain?

19:49.617 --> 19:51.486
No, because it never ruptured.
They clipped it.

19:51.519 --> 19:53.688
(phone ringing)
I take it the case
isn't about to settle now.

19:53.722 --> 19:55.123
Oh, no.

19:55.156 --> 19:57.225
And... we were fired.

19:57.959 --> 19:58.860
Sorry.

19:58.894 --> 20:00.161
I'm proud of you, Jimmy.

20:01.429 --> 20:02.630
I'll probably never get
my house now,

20:02.663 --> 20:04.499
but I'm proud of you.

20:04.532 --> 20:05.834
Me, too.

20:05.867 --> 20:09.270
Jimmy, that was
the Board of Bar Overseers.

20:10.071 --> 20:12.874
You've been summoned to appear
today at 1:00.

20:12.908 --> 20:14.075
BOBBY: What?

20:15.376 --> 20:16.745
They actually reported me.

20:16.778 --> 20:17.979
I didn't think they'd dare.

20:20.749 --> 20:23.051
Brenford Mutual
didn't report you.

20:24.886 --> 20:26.354
Who, then? Keene?

20:28.456 --> 20:29.690
I reported you, Jimmy.

20:32.160 --> 20:33.394
What?

20:35.196 --> 20:37.165
Under the Canon
of Legal Ethics,

20:37.198 --> 20:38.599
I had a duty
to report you.

20:39.701 --> 20:41.402
And if I had a vote,

20:41.436 --> 20:43.504
I'd recommend
you be disbarred.

21:09.164 --> 21:10.732
(door opens)

21:14.269 --> 21:16.137
They're calling him in
at 1:00.

21:16.972 --> 21:18.539
I heard.

21:23.011 --> 21:25.280
Why didn't you check
with me first?

21:25.914 --> 21:27.148
Did Jimmy check with you

21:27.182 --> 21:28.950
before breaking
the client's privilege?

21:28.984 --> 21:31.853
You revealed a pretty big
secret yourself, Eugene.

21:31.887 --> 21:34.655
Jimmy just told the parents
that the kid was sick.

21:34.689 --> 21:36.457
By reporting him
to the Bar,

21:36.491 --> 21:40.428
you revealed that it was
the client's intent not to tell,

21:40.461 --> 21:42.964
and the publicity of that
may be what brings them down.

21:42.998 --> 21:43.965
Did you consider that?

21:43.999 --> 21:47.468
I considered this--
Jimmy should go.

21:49.771 --> 21:51.372
I like him, but--

21:51.406 --> 21:53.541
Actually, right now
I'm not even sure I do.

21:54.609 --> 21:56.577
He put us all
at risk, Bobby.

21:56.611 --> 21:59.547
To flex his conscience,
he jeopardized this entire firm,

21:59.580 --> 22:02.083
same as he did
when he stole client funds

22:02.117 --> 22:03.318
to pay off
his gambling debt.

22:03.351 --> 22:05.320
You should have
come to me before--

22:05.353 --> 22:09.290
You...
would have done nothing.

22:12.728 --> 22:15.030
You're a nice guy.

22:15.063 --> 22:17.498
You would have let it ride
because Jimmy's a nice guy.

22:17.532 --> 22:18.934
He would have cried, "I'm sorry,

22:18.967 --> 22:20.635
it won't happen again,"
and you would have bought it.

22:20.668 --> 22:22.237
Well, I'm not
buying it anymore.

22:22.270 --> 22:24.472
I'm not letting him
take me down and everybody else.

22:24.505 --> 22:26.107
Enough is enough.

22:26.141 --> 22:29.177
He has to face
the consequences.

22:30.946 --> 22:32.547
I don't set
a lot of rules here.

22:35.383 --> 22:36.818
But we don't turn
on each other.

22:36.852 --> 22:38.053
I didn't turn on him.

22:38.086 --> 22:40.088
He turned on us
with what he did.

22:40.121 --> 22:41.556
He put us all at risk.

22:41.589 --> 22:43.759
By my reporting him,
I protected the firm, so--

22:43.792 --> 22:45.693
Oh, so you were
protecting us.
Damn right.

22:45.727 --> 22:47.595
Then why not
be open about it?

22:47.628 --> 22:48.797
Why not come to me before--

22:48.830 --> 22:50.031
Because you would have
protected him

22:50.065 --> 22:51.532
and put the firm
at risk, too.

22:51.566 --> 22:54.102
Then aren't we all lucky

22:54.135 --> 22:56.171
to have you
to look out for us.

22:58.039 --> 23:00.308
Imagine how safe
you make us feel.

23:01.509 --> 23:03.211
You taking his side, Bobby?

23:03.244 --> 23:05.113
What he did was wrong.

23:06.748 --> 23:08.449
But I don't like
what you did, either.

23:10.952 --> 23:13.521
And if you think you did it
the way you did to protect us...

23:15.991 --> 23:17.759
...then you're lying
to yourself.

23:26.101 --> 23:28.603
Obviously, we were
still processing

23:28.636 --> 23:31.672
the new information and trying
to decide what to do.

23:31.707 --> 23:36.211
It was an extremely agonizing
decision for all involved.

23:36.244 --> 23:38.013
As you left it
with Mr. Berluti,

23:38.046 --> 23:39.347
the client's decision

23:39.380 --> 23:41.282
was not to reveal
the boy's condition.

23:41.316 --> 23:42.818
There was nothing
to be accomplished

23:42.851 --> 23:44.085
in the course
of the night,

23:44.119 --> 23:46.254
so general counsel
at Brenford Mutual--

23:46.287 --> 23:49.925
Mr. Keene, we'll be here
all day if you choose to dance.

23:50.491 --> 23:51.692
I know you're trying to serve

23:51.727 --> 23:54.429
the public reputation
of Brenford Mutual,

23:54.462 --> 23:57.265
but that's not what
this hearing is about.

23:57.298 --> 23:58.700
Yes, Your Honor.

23:58.734 --> 24:01.202
Mr. Young
has reported to us

24:01.236 --> 24:03.538
that the client's
unequivocal instruction

24:03.571 --> 24:05.907
was for the attorneys
not to reveal

24:05.941 --> 24:07.542
what the client
had told them

24:07.575 --> 24:10.411
about Jason Lees'
medical condition.

24:10.445 --> 24:11.780
Is that true, sir?

24:11.813 --> 24:13.882
Personally, I believe that
that decision

24:13.915 --> 24:15.250
was subject to change.

24:15.283 --> 24:17.853
Answer my question, Mr. Keene.

24:19.020 --> 24:20.856
Yes.

24:20.889 --> 24:24.392
At the time that
Mr. Berluti chose to tell them,

24:24.425 --> 24:27.128
the client's wishes were
that he not do so.

24:28.329 --> 24:29.865
And from
your observation,

24:29.898 --> 24:32.267
Mr. Berluti was aware
of the client's wishes.

24:32.300 --> 24:35.403
We were all
acutely aware, yes.

24:38.273 --> 24:40.175
Okay, we'll take
a short break,

24:40.208 --> 24:42.077
then resume
with Mr. Berluti.

24:51.753 --> 24:53.221
Okay, my opinion--

24:53.254 --> 24:54.489
We just go with
straight emotion.

24:54.522 --> 24:56.624
All of this
happened so fast.

24:56.657 --> 24:58.159
You certainly did
the humane thing.

24:58.193 --> 25:00.829
Basically, you went
on autopilot, Jimmy.

25:00.862 --> 25:02.964
BOBBY: I agree.
You're dead on the law,

25:02.998 --> 25:04.933
and Hiller--
we know how she is.

25:04.966 --> 25:07.335
Just tell them you blew it.
Show some remorse.

25:07.368 --> 25:09.037
They can't be
without compassion.

25:10.605 --> 25:11.707
Okay.

25:12.841 --> 25:14.209
Jimmy?

25:15.676 --> 25:16.845
Are you okay?

25:17.846 --> 25:19.014
I'm fine.

25:30.992 --> 25:32.794
Is the hearing
going on now?

25:32.828 --> 25:34.830
We're on a break.

25:36.031 --> 25:37.733
But it's a closed session,
Mr. Lees.

25:37.766 --> 25:39.567
You can't go in.

25:41.102 --> 25:42.503
Where's Mr. Berluti?

25:43.972 --> 25:46.207
He's, uh, meeting
with his lawyers.

25:48.977 --> 25:50.078
How's your son?

25:50.846 --> 25:52.180
Do you care, Mr. Young?

25:55.550 --> 25:57.919
Look, Mr. Lees,
please try to understand.

26:00.621 --> 26:02.891
In the legal profession,

26:02.924 --> 26:04.392
there's a certain code...

26:07.262 --> 26:08.596
...that we have to live with.

26:09.798 --> 26:11.900
Then you live with it,
Mr. Young.

26:13.101 --> 26:14.469
You live with it.

26:21.176 --> 26:24.679
I think, you know,
emotion got the better of me.

26:24.713 --> 26:26.214
I kind of snapped.

26:26.247 --> 26:27.448
You kind of snapped.

26:27.482 --> 26:28.717
Like insanity?

26:28.750 --> 26:31.820
No, no.
I knew what I was doing,

26:31.853 --> 26:35.023
and I admit
what I did was wrong.

26:35.056 --> 26:37.058
But, uh,
let's not forget

26:37.092 --> 26:38.927
a life was maybe saved.

26:38.960 --> 26:40.929
That boy could have died.

26:40.962 --> 26:42.831
I'm a little confused.

26:42.864 --> 26:44.966
You say you admit
what you did was wrong,

26:45.000 --> 26:46.802
then you go on
to defend it.

26:46.835 --> 26:48.970
Do you think it was wrong
or don't you?

26:49.004 --> 26:52.307
Well, I knew it was wrong
under the law,

26:52.340 --> 26:55.643
but on a human level,
I guess I feel justified.

26:55.676 --> 26:59.380
So you chose to commit
a knowing violation of the law

26:59.414 --> 27:01.883
because you disagreed
with that law?

27:03.051 --> 27:04.886
It was
a very emotional night.

27:04.920 --> 27:08.456
So absent that emotion,
as you sit here today,

27:08.489 --> 27:11.559
if you had it
to do all over again,

27:11.592 --> 27:13.862
your reflective choice
would be

27:13.895 --> 27:16.297
to preserve
the client's secret.

27:16.331 --> 27:18.233
You wouldn't
tell the parents.

27:19.467 --> 27:21.703
Do I state it correctly,
Mr. Berluti?

27:28.844 --> 27:30.678
Mr. Berluti?

27:30.712 --> 27:32.480
Do I state it correctly?

27:38.720 --> 27:41.422
No, you do not,
Your Honor.

27:41.456 --> 27:43.324
If I had to do it
all over again,

27:43.358 --> 27:45.560
I'd do exactly
the same thing.

27:45.593 --> 27:47.628
I wouldn't
let that kid die.

27:47.662 --> 27:48.629
Would you?

27:48.663 --> 27:51.733
I wouldn't even ask myself
the question, sir.

27:51.767 --> 27:53.735
We don't consult
our personal feelings

27:53.769 --> 27:56.004
on a case-by-case basis.

27:56.037 --> 27:58.707
As officers of the court,
we abide by the law,

27:58.740 --> 28:01.576
and under the law,
there is no real question here.

28:01.609 --> 28:02.911
With all due respect,
Your Honor,

28:02.944 --> 28:04.445
if you feel
that way, then--

28:04.479 --> 28:07.248
It's not up to us to feel.
That's what--

28:07.282 --> 28:08.917
But we do.

28:08.950 --> 28:12.653
Whether the law says
we can or not, we feel.

28:12.687 --> 28:14.455
And if you can be
that cold about it,

28:14.489 --> 28:16.157
I don't care
how good a judge you are,

28:16.191 --> 28:17.993
you're not my idea
of a human being.

28:18.026 --> 28:19.895
Jimmy--
No, I don't care.

28:19.928 --> 28:21.863
I won't be judged
by the three of you.

28:23.098 --> 28:24.933
I won't be judged by you.

28:28.937 --> 28:31.272
If we're a society of laws,

28:31.306 --> 28:34.509
if we're a society that says
let that kid die,

28:34.542 --> 28:36.912
then the society
needs adjusting.

28:36.945 --> 28:38.613
So we should
let every lawyer act

28:38.646 --> 28:40.148
according to his or her
own conscience

28:40.181 --> 28:42.083
with no regard
for what the rules mandate.

28:42.117 --> 28:44.720
The rules should have
regard for a conscience.

28:44.753 --> 28:46.187
Yours?

28:46.221 --> 28:48.689
Mr. Young's conscience
might tell him to preserve

28:48.724 --> 28:50.558
the trusted confidence
of a client.

28:50.591 --> 28:53.628
Mr. Young doesn't act
out of conscience.

28:53.661 --> 28:55.696
Pick another example.

28:55.731 --> 28:57.632
I think we understand
your position.

28:57.665 --> 29:00.736
You don't believe
what you did is wrong,

29:00.769 --> 29:02.838
and faced
with the same choices,

29:02.871 --> 29:04.472
you'd do the same thing
over again.

29:05.874 --> 29:07.442
Yes.

29:09.811 --> 29:11.913
Okay, I think we're done.

29:23.992 --> 29:25.226
How'd it go?

29:25.260 --> 29:26.427
Not well.

29:26.461 --> 29:27.628
Did they rule?

29:27.662 --> 29:29.264
Under advisement.

29:29.297 --> 29:32.567
ELLENOR: Okay, thank you.
I appreciate it.

29:32.600 --> 29:34.569
They're willing to let me
make a brief summation

29:34.602 --> 29:37.806
before they decide,
so I'm gonna get to work on it.

29:38.740 --> 29:39.841
I don't have a conscience?

29:39.875 --> 29:42.778
No, Eugene, you don't.

29:42.811 --> 29:44.412
BOBBY: All right.

29:44.445 --> 29:46.214
It's all too easy for you.
Jimmy.

29:46.247 --> 29:48.917
What'd you do last night,
go home, flick on a ball game?

29:48.950 --> 29:50.318
EUGENE: You did
the easy thing, Jimmy.

29:50.351 --> 29:51.252
BOBBY: I don't want
to hear any of this.

29:51.286 --> 29:52.453
Well, I want to say it.

29:53.654 --> 29:56.657
We all wanted to tell.
Of course we did,

29:56.691 --> 29:58.293
but we were bound
by ethical duties--

29:58.326 --> 29:59.928
duties we swore
to uphold even when--

29:59.961 --> 30:02.864
Tell me about ethics. You--
I am telling you.

30:02.898 --> 30:06.067
You falsified loan documents.
You got fired from a bank.

30:06.101 --> 30:07.502
That's how you got hired here
in the first place.

30:07.535 --> 30:08.904
Old news.
A month ago,

30:08.937 --> 30:11.072
you stole from a client
to pay off your bookie.

30:11.106 --> 30:12.941
I damn well will tell you
about ethics.

30:12.974 --> 30:13.775
You're a thief.

30:16.344 --> 30:19.314
And last night,
you forked over a client.

30:19.347 --> 30:21.016
Was it a popular thing to do?

30:21.049 --> 30:23.418
I'm sure, yes, they'll probably
give you a medal for it,

30:23.451 --> 30:25.520
but it's not what we do.

30:26.287 --> 30:27.723
Not to the client.

30:27.756 --> 30:29.057
And as lawyers, Jimmy,

30:29.090 --> 30:32.327
we owe them our trust--
our trust!

30:32.360 --> 30:33.895
You're not trustworthy.

30:33.929 --> 30:37.298
You put no premium
on what it means
to be a lawyer.

30:37.332 --> 30:38.934
You disgraced everybody here,

30:38.967 --> 30:40.235
and you may have put us all

30:40.268 --> 30:43.404
out of business
in the process.

30:43.438 --> 30:44.906
You want to call yourself
a friend, Jimmy?

30:47.242 --> 30:48.409
You're not my friend.

30:55.316 --> 30:56.517
You done?

30:59.320 --> 31:02.724
How convenient for you
I'm a gambling addict

31:02.758 --> 31:05.026
or that I stole
that money.

31:05.060 --> 31:07.095
Makes it so easy for you
to conclude

31:07.128 --> 31:09.931
you got some
moral superiority going.

31:09.965 --> 31:11.432
You're more ethical,
so, hey,

31:11.466 --> 31:13.568
you must be right on this,
huh, Eugene?

31:14.535 --> 31:16.604
But you're not right.

31:16.637 --> 31:19.240
You would have
let that kid's head explode.

31:19.274 --> 31:20.742
You're not right.

31:21.877 --> 31:23.311
And going
behind my back--

31:24.913 --> 31:26.314
Well, I guess
that makes you...

31:27.282 --> 31:28.449
...friend.

31:32.821 --> 31:34.489
Why didn't you
resign, Jimmy?

31:36.792 --> 31:38.626
You're about
to go blow a confidence,

31:38.659 --> 31:40.261
put the firm at risk

31:40.295 --> 31:43.198
for a million-dollar
malpractice claim, minimum.

31:44.299 --> 31:46.702
Why not quit first
to protect us?

31:47.869 --> 31:49.570
Your conscience
ever give that a thought?

31:53.041 --> 31:54.976
Nope.

31:55.010 --> 31:56.244
But I'll tell you this--

31:57.445 --> 31:58.780
I quit now.

32:21.269 --> 32:25.140
...one man who scored
189 career touchdowns...

32:25.173 --> 32:26.775
(knock on door)

32:26.808 --> 32:28.710
...his high-powered offense,
and y'all won't believe--

32:28.744 --> 32:29.845
(switches off)

32:41.156 --> 32:42.724
I don't want you to quit.

32:44.259 --> 32:45.961
I know you don't,
Bobby, but--

32:45.994 --> 32:48.096
This was
an extreme situation.

32:50.131 --> 32:52.768
For my money,
you took us all off the hook.

32:55.603 --> 32:57.038
We all want you back.

32:58.306 --> 32:59.808
It kinda begs
the question of whether

32:59.841 --> 33:02.177
I even get to practice law.

33:02.210 --> 33:04.780
Ellenor's been working
all night on her statement.

33:04.813 --> 33:06.581
Let's not sell her short.

33:08.649 --> 33:11.753
You people have been
so good to me, Bobby.

33:13.488 --> 33:16.624
I know I haven't
lived up to...

33:17.625 --> 33:19.260
You really believe that?

33:20.028 --> 33:23.765
Overall, I've been
a liability.

33:26.001 --> 33:28.970
You still think of yourself
as Jimmy the Grunt?

33:29.004 --> 33:30.538
Do you ever stop to consider

33:30.571 --> 33:32.640
what a great trial lawyer
you've become?

33:32.673 --> 33:34.342
Did you pause for a second

33:34.375 --> 33:37.478
to wonder why Brenford Mutual
hired you here?

33:39.414 --> 33:41.649
You've become
a gifted trial lawyer.

33:43.184 --> 33:44.786
Now you tell me.

33:44.820 --> 33:46.221
As it's all about to end.

33:47.022 --> 33:48.323
Suppose it doesn't end.

33:50.926 --> 33:52.293
Will you come back?

33:54.529 --> 33:56.164
Of course I don't want
to leave.

34:07.642 --> 34:08.976
Working pretty late.

34:10.478 --> 34:12.547
Just hanging out
with all my friends.

34:14.549 --> 34:16.583
You don't think we're
your friends now, Eugene?

34:17.918 --> 34:20.021
I don't know, Rebecca.

34:20.054 --> 34:23.257
I just see and hear you all
cheering for Jimmy.

34:24.458 --> 34:26.127
Eugene, we're standing by him

34:26.161 --> 34:28.263
not because we necessarily
agree with him,

34:28.295 --> 34:30.165
but because he's family.

34:33.268 --> 34:35.771
You went outside of the family
on this one.

34:38.739 --> 34:42.043
It was the right thing to do.

34:48.149 --> 34:49.550
Clearly, you think that.

34:57.692 --> 35:00.796
The circumstances
were extremely exigent--

35:00.829 --> 35:03.198
a human life
hanging in the balance.

35:03.231 --> 35:05.500
Nobody could presume
to know the vise

35:05.533 --> 35:07.535
Jimmy Berluti was in
two nights ago.

35:07.568 --> 35:10.171
Ms. Frutt, I'm sorry.
I have to stop you.

35:10.205 --> 35:13.674
Lawyers are trained
to make difficult decisions.

35:13.709 --> 35:16.577
You people, of all people,
make them daily.

35:16.611 --> 35:18.246
I've watched you do it
in my courtroom.

35:18.279 --> 35:20.648
Not with these kinds
of stakes.

35:20.681 --> 35:23.251
Look, arguing his compassion
isn't going to fly.

35:23.284 --> 35:24.986
Do I get to give my closing?

35:25.020 --> 35:26.788
Yes, you do,
but I'm advising you

35:26.822 --> 35:28.656
not to whack us on the head
with emotion,

35:28.689 --> 35:32.093
especially since your client
says he'd do it all over again.

35:33.094 --> 35:35.296
He has a problem.

35:35.330 --> 35:37.733
You got the problem.
Jimmy.

35:37.766 --> 35:40.468
Since you don't want
to let Ellenor talk,
how about giving me a chance?

35:40.501 --> 35:43.104
HILLER: I thought we
heard you clearly yesterday,

35:43.138 --> 35:47.142
but if you have more to say,
I'm sure we're all quite rapt.

35:48.643 --> 35:50.678
I've made a lot of mistakes,

35:50.712 --> 35:53.782
but telling those parents
to take their son to a hospital

35:53.815 --> 35:55.316
wasn't one of them.

35:55.350 --> 35:56.918
Yes, it was.

35:56.952 --> 35:59.755
You don't get to decide
when you follow the rules

35:59.788 --> 36:00.789
and when you won't.

36:00.822 --> 36:04.059
Otherwise, what kind of anarchy
would we have?

36:04.092 --> 36:08.063
If the rules are a lawyer
can't tell a boy or his family

36:08.096 --> 36:11.199
that he has a life-threatening
medical situation,

36:11.232 --> 36:14.002
an emergency that could
kill him any second,

36:14.035 --> 36:18.406
if the rules say don't tell,
you got a problem.

36:18.439 --> 36:20.208
You all have a problem.

36:20.241 --> 36:22.577
This system has a problem.

36:22.610 --> 36:25.914
I'm sorry.
Is it us on trial now?

36:25.947 --> 36:28.149
Maybe you should be.

36:28.183 --> 36:30.986
The adversarial process
stopped being about the truth

36:31.019 --> 36:32.153
a long time ago.

36:32.187 --> 36:34.255
The adversaries lie
to each other.

36:34.289 --> 36:37.859
We lie and tell
false truths every day,

36:37.893 --> 36:40.028
and you wonder why
nobody respects us?

36:41.029 --> 36:44.365
It started off being about
fairness and due process,

36:44.399 --> 36:46.702
and it's become about winning.

36:46.735 --> 36:50.138
And now we're to sit quiet

36:50.171 --> 36:53.742
while an innocent kid
has a time bomb in his head?

36:53.775 --> 36:57.045
We're duty-bound to let him die
out of privilege?

36:57.078 --> 36:59.514
And you expect the public
to admire our profession?

37:00.448 --> 37:02.718
A person who's honorable,

37:02.751 --> 37:04.319
a person with integrity,

37:04.352 --> 37:07.789
a person who believes
that a human life has sanctity

37:07.823 --> 37:10.892
doesn't let
an innocent child die.

37:12.894 --> 37:16.131
I said this yesterday
and I'll say it again.

37:16.164 --> 37:18.800
I will not be judged by you.

37:46.194 --> 37:47.929
Listen...

37:48.797 --> 37:51.066
I, uh, know I've been
stomping my foot

37:51.099 --> 37:53.201
with a lot
of righteous indignation,

37:54.269 --> 37:58.139
but, uh, Eugene was right
about one thing.

37:59.007 --> 38:00.341
I should have had
the decency

38:00.375 --> 38:01.777
to quit before I...

38:02.744 --> 38:06.214
I just...
didn't think to do it.

38:07.282 --> 38:10.051
I'm sorry for putting
the firm at risk.

38:13.054 --> 38:14.189
Anyway...

38:17.558 --> 38:19.460
May I see you a moment
in private?

38:20.595 --> 38:22.864
I don't want to get into it
anymore with you.

38:22.898 --> 38:25.400
May I see you
in private, Jimmy?

38:34.375 --> 38:35.643
The reason I, uh...

38:42.984 --> 38:44.185
My brother...

38:45.520 --> 38:47.222
He died in prison
serving time

38:47.255 --> 38:48.824
for something he didn't do.

38:49.791 --> 38:51.827
The police coerced
a confession that--

38:55.063 --> 38:58.566
The police-- they had
no regard for the system.

38:59.968 --> 39:01.302
And if the day comes

39:01.336 --> 39:03.839
that lawyers start
giving up their clients,

39:03.872 --> 39:05.841
giving up their secrets,
then the system has--

39:12.580 --> 39:15.383
I've put more murderers
back out there than I can count

39:15.416 --> 39:16.852
in the name of the system.

39:16.885 --> 39:19.788
I need to believe
in its legitimacy.

39:23.725 --> 39:25.060
I went home the other night...

39:26.427 --> 39:28.463
...and I wanted
to tell that family

39:28.496 --> 39:30.832
just like we all did,
and, uh,

39:30.866 --> 39:33.869
I kept telling myself
I had no choice.

39:33.902 --> 39:36.404
The rules were clear,
I had no choice,

39:36.437 --> 39:37.973
and I was prepared
to let that boy die,

39:38.006 --> 39:39.307
but what you did...

39:40.575 --> 39:41.743
was point out...

39:43.144 --> 39:44.880
...I had a choice.

39:48.817 --> 39:50.451
A choice you made
that I...

39:51.552 --> 39:52.721
I didn't.

39:53.554 --> 39:54.856
I suppose, uh...

39:58.994 --> 39:59.995
You, uh...

40:01.730 --> 40:03.965
you did what you did
and was acting out of emotion.

40:04.966 --> 40:07.635
My doing what I did--

40:07.668 --> 40:09.670
reporting you,
going outside of the family--

40:09.705 --> 40:11.740
I was acting
on emotion as well.

40:14.475 --> 40:15.844
Anyway, I, uh...

40:18.714 --> 40:20.081
You're good with me.

40:22.951 --> 40:24.820
And I hope in time
I'll be good with you.

40:29.524 --> 40:31.292
(door opens)

40:31.326 --> 40:32.560
They're back with their ruling.

40:48.676 --> 40:51.780
Mr. Berluti, you touched
on a number of themes

40:51.813 --> 40:53.381
that are very close to me.

40:53.414 --> 40:56.451
It's true,
we no longer impose

40:56.484 --> 40:59.620
the burden on attorneys
to be honorable,

40:59.654 --> 41:02.758
and that's unfortunate,
if not disgraceful.

41:03.624 --> 41:05.293
But it's also true,

41:05.326 --> 41:07.062
which you know full well,

41:07.095 --> 41:10.098
legal ethics and morality

41:10.131 --> 41:12.633
are not only
two distinct concepts,

41:12.667 --> 41:15.636
they're quite often
mutually exclusive.

41:15.670 --> 41:20.308
And if lawyers
start letting personal morality

41:20.341 --> 41:22.177
be their compass,

41:22.210 --> 41:24.545
the system and all
the participants in it

41:24.579 --> 41:26.281
are collectively lost.

41:27.248 --> 41:31.186
So we carve out rules,
many of them quite strict.

41:31.219 --> 41:34.990
And the strictest,
perhaps the most paramount,

41:35.023 --> 41:37.625
goes to client trust.

41:37.658 --> 41:40.762
What a client tells his lawyer

41:40.796 --> 41:42.430
is sacrosanct.

41:42.463 --> 41:45.266
The attorney
doesn't get to decide

41:45.300 --> 41:48.503
when he'll honor the privilege
and when he won't.

41:49.270 --> 41:53.441
You broke that seal,
Mr. Berluti.

41:54.409 --> 41:56.277
The rule we hold most dear--

41:56.311 --> 41:57.779
you broke it,

41:57.813 --> 41:59.715
and your moral preaching aside,

41:59.748 --> 42:01.950
there's no excuse for it.

42:01.983 --> 42:02.984
None.

42:06.454 --> 42:09.057
That having been said,

42:09.090 --> 42:11.292
this board does have discretion

42:11.326 --> 42:12.861
as to what we do with you.

42:12.894 --> 42:15.731
We applied a very unscientific
test back there.

42:15.764 --> 42:17.132
We asked ourselves

42:17.165 --> 42:19.801
is the profession of law
better served

42:19.835 --> 42:23.571
with you in it or out of it?

42:25.907 --> 42:27.375
We decided...

42:27.408 --> 42:29.177
better to have you in it.

42:32.280 --> 42:34.649
You're suspended
for three weeks.

42:35.316 --> 42:36.818
We are adjourned.

42:49.064 --> 42:49.731
How about that?

42:51.967 --> 42:53.735
I survive.

42:56.004 --> 42:58.874
Come on, we've already blown
most of the day.

42:59.708 --> 43:01.042
Let's get back to work.

43:39.480 --> 43:42.150
(music playing)

44:05.640 --> 44:06.875
You stinker!
