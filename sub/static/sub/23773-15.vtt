FILM 15

01:08.760 --> 01:10.600
<i>Do you think I’m a monster?</i>

01:10.680 --> 01:13.400
<i>I’m the same as you.</i>

01:14.160 --> 01:15.600
<i>It’s just that I dared.</i>

01:46.960 --> 01:48.720
Why are you looking so natty?

01:49.240 --> 01:51.320
-It’s a holiday!
-What holiday?

01:52.000 --> 01:53.320
This one.

01:54.240 --> 01:56.440
-Are you ready?
-What, can’t you see?

02:16.440 --> 02:18.040
SECURITY

02:22.840 --> 02:23.920
Come on.

02:49.240 --> 02:51.040
How long will this take?

02:51.640 --> 02:54.040
The first phase--
half a month to two months,

02:54.640 --> 02:55.920
depending on his progress.

02:57.240 --> 02:59.520
Then he can be moved
to general population.

03:16.400 --> 03:19.560
“Did I, a simple Russian woman, think”…

03:30.640 --> 03:32.040
I’ll come tomorrow.

03:47.720 --> 03:49.040
Close the door.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.320
It’s you.

04:07.720 --> 04:08.720
What?

04:10.200 --> 04:12.400
I’ve observed him for 23 years. I’ve never seen him so calm.

04:16.920 --> 04:18.959
You’ve turned him into a different man.

04:19.040 --> 04:20.040
A weak man?

04:21.240 --> 04:23.240
Well, to some degree, yes.

04:28.680 --> 04:32.400
He never let himself have a chance
at a normal life.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.480
He always lived on the edge.

04:36.240 --> 04:41.200
He had mobilized all his psychic processes
and his body’s energetic reserves.

04:42.320 --> 04:43.920
And then you showed up.

04:46.040 --> 04:51.560
This is new to you--
dedicating yourself to such critical work.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.800
And everything is going well.

04:55.760 --> 05:00.080
But you have to relax,
or you’ll succumb to some minor illness.

05:02.720 --> 05:05.320
-Yeah, it happens.
-It’s the same with him.

05:06.360 --> 05:07.560
You showed up…

05:08.560 --> 05:13.200
and he subconsciously
told his mind to relax.

05:14.240 --> 05:15.680
He let you in…

05:17.160 --> 05:18.560
and became weaker.

05:19.280 --> 05:23.280
But this weakness
gives us a chance to treat him

05:24.080 --> 05:26.880
<i>and make him different, normal.</i>

05:28.320 --> 05:32.120
<i>But under no circumstances</i>
<i>can he allowed to mobilize his psyche.</i>

05:32.680 --> 05:36.440
<i>And he especially must not attain</i>
<i>that intense peak experience</i>

05:36.960 --> 05:38.840
<i>that happens when he…</i>

05:38.920 --> 05:40.120
<i>Kills?</i>

05:40.680 --> 05:42.880
<i>When he concludes an investigation.</i>

05:44.000 --> 05:45.840
<i>But that’s not a threat here.</i>

05:46.400 --> 05:49.560
<i>Rest. The most important thing is rest.</i>

05:49.640 --> 05:51.600
Then he’ll get back on his feet.

05:51.680 --> 05:52.680
All right.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.040
I’ll see to it.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.560
<i>Do you feel it?</i>

06:05.920 --> 06:07.120
<i>I love you.</i>

06:07.480 --> 06:09.520
Did you discuss interrogation strategies
with Meglin?

06:09.600 --> 06:10.680
What do you mean?

06:10.760 --> 06:12.640
What to say, what not to say.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.520
Why do you think
we would have talked about that?

06:15.600 --> 06:20.560
Meglin abused every single power
that was given him, to the extreme.

06:20.640 --> 06:23.960
He knew that one day we’d check on him
and that you’d be tested.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.320
Did he give you instructions
or ask you to do anything?

06:27.400 --> 06:31.120
He asked one thing of me--
to hold his hand when it happened!

06:31.200 --> 06:32.600
Nothing else!

06:48.960 --> 06:50.160
Sazonov. Meglin.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.840
Sanya’s late. I’ll call him. He’s not coming. Don’t call.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.240
Why?

07:50.320 --> 07:52.360
I talked to him this morning.

07:52.440 --> 07:53.760
I talked to him an hour ago.

07:54.960 --> 07:58.400
I said you couldn’t make it,
that you had important business.

07:58.840 --> 08:00.520
You had to reschedule the meeting.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.920
Zhen, that’s even a bit much for you.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.840
What, you aren’t happy to be with me,

08:07.440 --> 08:09.800
like we used to be?

08:13.960 --> 08:16.480
I actually wanted
to have a serious talk with you.

08:16.560 --> 08:17.960
Privately.

08:19.080 --> 08:21.640
Really? I’m listening.

08:25.680 --> 08:26.680
Here…

08:28.840 --> 08:31.200
This guy escaped.

08:35.880 --> 08:36.919
A mass murderer.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.840
He goes by “Strelok.”

08:39.919 --> 08:42.000
He’s dropping people left and right.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.760
He broke into a home
and randomly killed women and children.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.600
Nine bodies in one week.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.520
You haven’t heard anything about this?

08:50.600 --> 08:51.600
No.

08:52.840 --> 08:55.600
They formed a working group of 40 people.
I’m part of it.

08:55.680 --> 08:58.400
We’re doing everything we can.
No one knows how to catch him.

08:59.880 --> 09:01.280
He’s just smarter than them.

09:02.640 --> 09:03.920
By “them,” you mean “us.”

09:06.600 --> 09:08.800
By them I mean us, but not you, of course.

09:09.480 --> 09:12.640
Meglin would’ve caught him quickly, but…

09:13.640 --> 09:15.040
they didn’t call you.

09:16.320 --> 09:17.520
What happened?

09:17.600 --> 09:19.480
I don’t know. Is there a theory?

09:20.920 --> 09:22.520
There’s no theory, just guesses.

09:24.760 --> 09:28.320
At the office,
rumor is that Meglin’s sick.

09:29.840 --> 09:31.160
The general tone, you know…

09:33.000 --> 09:34.800
is that the wolf can’t hunt anymore.

09:36.840 --> 09:39.680
-Is that true?
-No, he’s fine.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.440
Should we have some champagne
since Sasha isn’t coming?

09:45.040 --> 09:46.520
Open it.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.560
I like that idea.

10:08.200 --> 10:09.720
This is for you.

10:11.880 --> 10:13.080
This is for me.

10:29.320 --> 10:31.720
Zhen,
haven’t we already talked about this?

10:34.880 --> 10:39.000
Look, how about… a quickie?

10:40.120 --> 10:41.640
Like the good ol’ days.

10:42.280 --> 10:44.120
You used to be such a little tease.

10:44.920 --> 10:46.360
Zhen.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.280
And you can pretend…

10:51.600 --> 10:54.440
that I’m him.

11:50.120 --> 11:51.840
How’d you know I was here?

11:55.440 --> 11:56.840
Have you been following me?

11:57.880 --> 11:58.880
Why?

12:01.560 --> 12:03.200
And why aren’t you in the hospital?

12:05.160 --> 12:08.040
Are you aware
you just asked four questions in a row?

12:08.480 --> 12:12.000
You’re a shitty investigator.
I’ll answer the first two.

12:12.600 --> 12:16.240
For a week, you’ve been going on about
when and where you were going to meet.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.800
What was the third question?

12:17.880 --> 12:20.400
-Why?
-Good question. It’s concise.

12:21.680 --> 12:23.080
Why, for example…

12:24.240 --> 12:25.680
did you turn him down?

12:27.760 --> 12:30.440
That’s not good. It’s not friendly.

12:30.520 --> 12:32.480
You’re sure I turned him down?

12:32.560 --> 12:35.200
You were pissed and flung open the doors.
Of course you did.

12:36.080 --> 12:38.240
Don’t lose him. He has promise.

12:38.840 --> 12:40.680
I’m meeting with Zhenya about a case.

12:41.400 --> 12:44.120
He said there’s a serial killer.
Possibly a mass serial killer.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.440
I know.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.280
We’re going there now.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.240
And there’s your answer
to the other questions.

12:58.600 --> 12:59.920
Well, are we going?

13:41.120 --> 13:42.360
You’re here.

13:43.520 --> 13:47.000
-I heard you were sick.
-I’m sick all the time. I’m used to it.

13:48.040 --> 13:50.280
-Well, thank God.
-What do you mean thank God?

13:50.360 --> 13:52.800
Well, this case is so…
horrible to look at.

13:52.880 --> 13:55.520
It was horrible for them.
You’re an investigator.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.600
Get everyone out.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.120
Guys, everyone out.

14:48.440 --> 14:49.640
And lock the door.

14:50.760 --> 14:52.160
From the other side.

15:16.600 --> 15:17.600
Turn it on.

15:28.800 --> 15:31.520
<i>Rodion, hello.</i>

15:33.920 --> 15:35.680
<i>Well, you see it all.</i>

15:37.680 --> 15:39.120
<i>A happy family--</i>

15:41.800 --> 15:43.280
<i>a wife and husband…</i>

15:44.760 --> 15:47.160
<i>three kids, and dinner.</i>

15:50.160 --> 15:53.000
<i>And I came here and killed them all.</i>

15:56.600 --> 15:58.880
<i>More accurately, I’m killing them now.</i>

15:58.960 --> 15:59.960
<i>Watch.</i>

16:04.280 --> 16:05.480
<i>Papa!</i>

16:07.680 --> 16:09.600
<i>Please don’t!</i>

16:12.800 --> 16:13.920
<i>Please!</i>

16:26.760 --> 16:28.160
<i>Do you think that’s horrible?</i>

16:32.280 --> 16:33.960
<i>I looked them in the face.</i>

16:34.960 --> 16:36.280
<i>I’ll remember them.</i>

16:39.000 --> 16:41.600
<i>Imagine it. Now that’s horror.</i>

16:47.520 --> 16:49.520
<i>I do this because I have to.</i>

16:50.840 --> 16:53.240
<i>It’s my… cross to bear.</i>

16:54.800 --> 16:56.080
<i>For you.</i>

16:57.000 --> 16:59.880
<i>Well, so that you… understand.</i>

17:03.520 --> 17:06.280
<i>No one is protecting you. No one.</i>

17:07.680 --> 17:09.280
<i>Well, regardless, Rodion…</i>

17:12.720 --> 17:14.160
<i>we’ll be seeing each other.</i>

17:17.599 --> 17:19.200
You know him? Who is he?

17:22.800 --> 17:25.520
They didn’t introduce us.
It wasn’t the thing to do.

17:27.960 --> 17:29.160
But, yes, I know him.

17:30.880 --> 17:31.880
Who’s “us”?

17:36.320 --> 17:37.800
Border Guard Service.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.440
Alyosha Anufriev,

17:48.520 --> 17:51.960
goes by the nickname Strelok,
44 years old.

17:52.360 --> 17:55.040
He was born
in a small working class village.

17:55.120 --> 17:56.920
His parents drank.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.920
His father went to prison four times.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.760
After the army, he joined the militia.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.920
He was fired in ’98…

18:07.920 --> 18:11.720
for abuse of authority and violence
against detainees or something.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.480
How do you know him?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.960
We went through training together--
special forces.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.240
Then I grabbed him. He kills nonstop.

18:25.760 --> 18:28.200
The pauses between the crimes
are negligible.

18:29.520 --> 18:32.120
Last time,
we got him for a serial killing.

18:33.760 --> 18:35.440
Nine bodies.

18:35.520 --> 18:37.520
Kursk, Oryol, Tambov, Kamyshin. Nine people in four days.

18:42.320 --> 18:45.320
He always burns the house down
as he leaves.

18:46.720 --> 18:49.480
-Except for last time.
-Except for last time.

18:49.560 --> 18:52.400
-Why?
-Don’t be stupid. He left the camera.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.240
The message would’ve burned.

18:55.920 --> 18:57.320
Why didn’t they run?

18:58.120 --> 19:00.040
He has a shotgun.

19:00.600 --> 19:03.160
After two shots, he has to reload.

19:03.760 --> 19:07.480
He shoots, reloads, and they sit there.
Why?

19:08.720 --> 19:12.200
Because people, by their very nature,
are optimists. You didn’t know?

19:12.720 --> 19:15.560
They’re always hoping for the best.

19:15.640 --> 19:19.120
He said if they run, they die.
So they sit there quietly.

19:20.240 --> 19:21.880
Hoping.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.480
If you run, you’ll surely die.

19:24.520 --> 19:27.440
And if you sit there,
maybe you’ll make it through.

19:27.520 --> 19:30.960
You can reach an agreement, beg,
or the police will come to save you.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.400
What did you see in the house?

19:34.320 --> 19:35.640
It’s not a cheap house.

19:36.720 --> 19:40.680
In the bedroom, the woman had
diamond earrings next to a jewelry box.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.360
There was a gold chain.

19:43.240 --> 19:44.440
He doesn’t steal.

19:45.360 --> 19:47.440
He has another motive. What is it?

19:48.640 --> 19:51.000
How is he choosing his victims?

19:51.080 --> 19:53.080
By their fences.

19:53.160 --> 19:55.080
He chooses the tallest.

19:57.120 --> 19:58.120
Meaning?

20:00.040 --> 20:03.200
People put up a fence
thinking that it protects them.

20:03.880 --> 20:07.480
The taller the fence, the safer they are.

20:07.560 --> 20:08.760
Fools.

20:09.400 --> 20:12.120
They don’t understand they’re helping him.

20:12.880 --> 20:15.520
Devil knows
what they’ve built around themselves.

20:16.240 --> 20:19.440
Nonetheless. A shotgun’s loud.
He’s taking a risk.

20:20.840 --> 20:22.440
You seriously think that?

20:23.480 --> 20:27.880
People will crawl out from their holes
and ask, “Can you kill them more quietly?

20:27.960 --> 20:31.160
The screams are interrupting our TV.”

20:31.960 --> 20:34.200
-Is it easier for you that way?
-What’s easier for me?

20:34.280 --> 20:36.680
Easier to live,
thinking about people that way.

20:38.040 --> 20:40.520
Does it make you feel less responsible?

20:40.600 --> 20:43.440
I don’t think anything.
I say it like it is.

20:45.280 --> 20:49.040
People are apathetic and unkind,
but not that bad.

21:23.440 --> 21:24.680
Sit in the car.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.320
Sit in the car!

22:01.320 --> 22:02.320
Sit.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.520
Empty your pockets.

22:34.320 --> 22:35.640
You live simply.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.920
I spent everything on cactuses.

22:43.480 --> 22:46.000
Why are you standing there?
Come in, sit down.

22:57.840 --> 22:59.200
Put your gun down.

23:18.600 --> 23:19.920
Sit.

23:29.800 --> 23:31.040
What did you do to him?

23:34.360 --> 23:36.680
Back in the day,
my dead body would already be lying here.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.600
You’re losing your touch, Rodik. Freak.

23:43.400 --> 23:44.800
You’ve gotten old.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.600
You think she’ll make you normal?

23:50.680 --> 23:51.800
No.

23:53.440 --> 23:54.640
Although, I’m jealous.

23:59.080 --> 24:00.480
But jealousy is a sin.

24:01.480 --> 24:04.400
By the way, talking about sins…

24:07.400 --> 24:09.200
Do you want to know about my first kill?

24:10.440 --> 24:11.440
Out of interest.

24:12.560 --> 24:16.640
I wanted to understand why they do it--
serial killers.

24:17.880 --> 24:22.760
So I decided… to try it out.

24:25.120 --> 24:29.320
Then wait and see if I felt tempted again.

24:33.240 --> 24:34.920
True, there ended up being two of them.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.400
Small-time smugglers.

24:37.360 --> 24:38.600
They fell asleep in their car.

24:39.040 --> 24:41.240
They were tired.
They had millions to earn.

24:41.320 --> 24:42.800
What did you feel?

24:46.400 --> 24:47.200
Nothing.

24:48.600 --> 24:50.000
Not satisfaction.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.480
Not compassion.

24:54.200 --> 24:56.000
Simply nothing at all.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.520
-And everyone was in a panic!
-Did it take hold of you?

25:01.680 --> 25:03.080
You came back after all.

25:05.640 --> 25:06.640
It took hold of me.

25:08.120 --> 25:09.760
You know, it’s like…

25:11.720 --> 25:13.480
a hunger or something.

25:13.560 --> 25:14.560
Like an itch.

25:15.440 --> 25:17.760
I killed again to try to understand.

25:18.520 --> 25:19.960
Then again.

25:20.040 --> 25:22.240
-Then I understood.
-Enlighten me.

25:23.560 --> 25:25.040
Everyone is already dead…

25:27.440 --> 25:29.200
and I come to honor them.

25:30.280 --> 25:33.480
Do you think
I only killed the nine last time?

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Nine days of killing.

25:37.480 --> 25:39.080
Now it’s been 40 days. I’m going to take 40 souls.

25:42.640 --> 25:44.480
And then 365.

25:45.440 --> 25:46.440
People are ready.

25:46.520 --> 25:50.280
Back in the day, they would’ve shot me
without a word for one murdered child.

25:51.160 --> 25:53.520
But now after 10, 40, 100…

25:54.520 --> 25:56.200
they’ll just put me on TV.

25:56.920 --> 25:58.720
Then I’ll tell people everything.

25:59.920 --> 26:01.520
I’ll be a hero.

26:04.640 --> 26:07.760
And they won’t even recognize you
at the office.

26:09.480 --> 26:12.200
Meglin? Who’s that?
There’s no Meglin here.

26:18.040 --> 26:19.440
There it is. I’m still here.

26:23.200 --> 26:26.680
You know, when Chikatilo returned
to Novocherassk military prison

26:26.760 --> 26:29.160
after his psychiatric evaluation,

26:29.960 --> 26:31.960
I was sent to him.

26:32.040 --> 26:33.720
He loved to gossip with me.

26:34.840 --> 26:38.480
I asked him, “Romanich, what’s with you?

26:38.560 --> 26:41.120
You’re not yourself. You look so down.”

26:41.200 --> 26:43.360
I said, “What happened?”

26:44.320 --> 26:47.040
And he said to me, “Imagine,
they took us to a bathhouse in Moscow.”

26:48.840 --> 26:50.920
One eagle spreads his wings out,

26:51.000 --> 26:53.320
walks around the bathhouse and says,
“I killed five people.”

26:54.720 --> 26:57.480
And Romanich said to me,
“I’m standing to the side thinking,

26:58.160 --> 27:00.960
‘Brother, if only you knew
how many people I’ve killed.

27:01.960 --> 27:04.040
Then you’d know who I really am.’”

27:05.280 --> 27:08.360
And I asked him, “Well, who are you?

27:10.520 --> 27:11.760
Who are you?”

27:14.840 --> 27:16.040
He bawled.

27:17.960 --> 27:20.080
He didn’t tell me who he was.

27:26.960 --> 27:28.360
Chikatilo was a puppy.

27:29.280 --> 27:31.520
-Unhappy and sick.
-Are you healthy?

27:32.200 --> 27:35.400
-Why were you kicked off the police force?
-I left on my own.

27:35.480 --> 27:38.360
There’s no principle there.
It’s all about money.

27:38.440 --> 27:40.680
And I wanted to protect the line.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.200
What line?

27:42.280 --> 27:44.800
The line between what’s right and wrong.

27:47.720 --> 27:52.440
In order to protect that line,
you have to know where it is.

27:52.520 --> 27:54.560
-You didn’t know.
-Now I know.

27:55.520 --> 27:57.800
It doesn’t exist. It’s made-up.

27:58.680 --> 28:00.840
People are given freedom, and what?

28:00.920 --> 28:02.520
Nothing happens.

28:02.600 --> 28:04.400
Now they have to be taught a lesson.

28:05.280 --> 28:07.560
Right now, no one understands me.

28:07.640 --> 28:09.120
They’ll understand later.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.920
I’m doing something
that people can’t understand.

28:14.400 --> 28:16.120
Only you stopped me.

28:17.600 --> 28:19.480
But you won’t stop me anymore.

28:24.480 --> 28:26.080
How about something to drink?

28:26.840 --> 28:28.320
We’ll drink to our reunion.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.320
And to parting.

28:37.880 --> 28:39.200
Let her go.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.240
She has nothing to do with this.

28:41.760 --> 28:44.080
As I understand this,
this is only between us.

28:44.960 --> 28:47.760
She’ll tell the media
about your genius plan.

28:48.480 --> 28:50.400
Don’t you want people to listen to you?

28:52.360 --> 28:54.680
-You were better back in the day.
-I agree.

28:54.760 --> 28:56.640
You’re cheaper now somehow.

28:57.600 --> 29:00.880
People already know everything.
Don’t worry.

29:13.160 --> 29:14.240
Don’t do it!

29:17.920 --> 29:19.720
You can’t kill him.

29:23.480 --> 29:26.080
Do you think you’ve stopped me?

29:28.200 --> 29:30.040
It’s not over, Meglin.

29:32.320 --> 29:34.720
It’s all… just beginning.

29:35.760 --> 29:37.880
Rodion, don’t do it, please.

30:02.840 --> 30:04.160
How are you?

30:04.240 --> 30:06.680
Superficial wounds, but it was buckshot.

30:06.760 --> 30:08.280
There’s a lot of shrapnel.

30:08.360 --> 30:11.240
-You have to come along with us.
-For how long?

30:11.920 --> 30:15.240
If everything is fine,
we’ll release you tomorrow. Don’t worry.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.080
I hoped you’d be able to protect her.

30:31.720 --> 30:33.400
She’s perfectly capable.

30:46.960 --> 30:48.960
SEAMAN’S SILENCE
DETENTION FACILITY

31:30.560 --> 31:31.560
Yes.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.240
I thought you wouldn’t pick up.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.840
<i>I was thinking the same thing.</i>

31:36.920 --> 31:38.120
<i>Well, how are you?</i> I’m fine.

31:40.800 --> 31:42.000
Everything’s fine. The pills?

31:49.280 --> 31:50.560
You already know.

31:50.960 --> 31:52.400
<i>Are they making you dull?</i>

31:53.720 --> 31:54.920
<i>Never mind.</i>

31:55.600 --> 31:59.800
A small loss for mankind--
a few days without your great mind.

32:02.320 --> 32:03.520
Drink.

32:03.600 --> 32:05.120
So I can hear you.

32:12.640 --> 32:16.760
Bergich said this is only for a month,
and then we’re going away.

32:21.600 --> 32:23.920
-Where to?
-<i>To the seaside.</i>

32:24.000 --> 32:26.360
<i>I haven’t been there in a hundred years.</i>
<i>How about you?</i>

32:27.960 --> 32:28.960
Even longer.

32:31.120 --> 32:32.520
Well, what do you think?

32:34.480 --> 32:37.600
I say all right.

32:39.120 --> 32:40.440
Let’s go.

32:43.640 --> 32:44.800
Then have a drink

32:45.720 --> 32:47.200
for me.

33:03.840 --> 33:05.040
And you eat.

33:05.960 --> 33:07.800
Thanks…

33:26.360 --> 33:27.960
Are you happy now?

33:28.560 --> 33:29.560
Yes.

33:33.560 --> 33:34.880
Good night.

33:55.520 --> 33:57.240
What did you forget?

33:57.320 --> 33:58.720
<i>Strelok escaped.</i>

34:02.400 --> 34:05.560
He opened the lock with a pick
that was sewn into his hand.

34:06.040 --> 34:09.560
He grabbed a knife from a guard’s belt
and cut all their throats.

34:12.120 --> 34:14.120
I sent squads to you and Esenya.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.000
<i>Be careful.</i> <i>Rodion.</i>

34:20.080 --> 34:21.840
<i>Do you hear me? Rodion!</i>

34:27.000 --> 34:29.320
I told you I’d come back.

34:42.600 --> 34:44.320
I’m not going to kill you.

34:54.440 --> 34:56.560
You’re already dead.

34:59.960 --> 35:02.160
I want you to see the full picture.

35:04.480 --> 35:06.560
I’m going where it all started.

35:10.880 --> 35:12.080
Forty souls…

35:13.120 --> 35:14.520
this time.

35:32.360 --> 35:34.240
Where can I drop you off?

35:36.400 --> 35:37.600
Right here.

35:43.120 --> 35:44.520
Bratskaya.

35:45.280 --> 35:47.520
-Is it a grave or something?
-Don’t say that.

35:48.200 --> 35:49.400
It’s the country.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.800
-Are there are any pretty girls?
-There are.

36:06.120 --> 36:08.120
BRATSKAYA

36:41.120 --> 36:42.840
You never carry a firearm.

36:42.920 --> 36:44.240
Just in case.

36:50.440 --> 36:51.480
Yes.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.200
On our way.

36:59.880 --> 37:01.440
Bratskaya.

37:02.080 --> 37:03.520
On the way to Murom.

37:05.600 --> 37:06.840
Got it.

37:07.440 --> 37:09.440
BRATSKAYA

37:42.480 --> 37:44.960
He’s not human. A human couldn’t do this.

37:45.040 --> 37:46.880
Quit your crying. Be specific.

37:46.960 --> 37:49.840
You don’t understand. It was a wedding.

37:50.440 --> 37:53.400
He shot everyone point-blank
and then set it on fire.

37:54.720 --> 37:56.320
The wounded burned alive. Who saw him?

38:00.400 --> 38:02.920
The neighbors next door.
They were afraid to come out.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.600
But they stayed alive.

40:53.840 --> 40:56.560
-Where are you?
-<i>I have her. Wait for my call.</i>

42:26.040 --> 42:27.320
How could you!

42:28.040 --> 42:31.080
What about you? We both lost her.

42:32.680 --> 42:35.360
If something--
If something happens to her…

42:36.720 --> 42:39.280
I have no one but her! No one!

42:39.360 --> 42:42.040
I’m asking you to find her.
Do whatever you have to.

42:53.680 --> 42:55.480
You-- Who are you?

42:55.560 --> 42:57.280
What are you doing?

42:57.360 --> 42:58.920
-Who are you?
-Stand back!

42:59.000 --> 43:00.360
-You can’t be here.
-Calm down!

43:00.440 --> 43:02.320
It’s under control!
Investigative Committee.

43:04.560 --> 43:06.160
Do you have any tacks?

43:06.240 --> 43:07.320
Give them here.

43:09.800 --> 43:10.960
MOSCOW

43:13.360 --> 43:14.720
TVER

43:15.440 --> 43:16.560
RYZAN

43:17.240 --> 43:17.960
TAMBOV

43:18.040 --> 43:19.640
What’s gotten into you?

43:21.480 --> 43:22.440
SARATOV

43:28.240 --> 43:29.000
Yes!

43:30.080 --> 43:31.480
What do you mean nothing?

43:33.120 --> 43:35.000
Keep searching! Turn it upside down!

43:35.080 --> 43:36.840
He went here. Andryusha.

43:36.920 --> 43:38.400
-Wait.
-Right here.

43:38.480 --> 43:41.160
-How do you figure?
-Because it’s a cross!

43:41.240 --> 43:42.640
So what?

43:44.920 --> 43:47.680
It’s the place where it all started.

43:47.760 --> 43:49.760
NIZHNY NOVGOROD

43:56.480 --> 43:58.280
NIZHNY NOVGOROD

44:14.120 --> 44:15.120
Yes.

44:19.080 --> 44:20.280
Where exactly?

44:48.560 --> 44:50.360
You think that he’s better?

44:50.440 --> 44:51.440
He’s worse.

44:53.160 --> 44:54.360
I kill.

44:57.080 --> 44:59.360
But all this horror runs through me.

45:00.360 --> 45:03.160
He doesn’t repent. He doesn’t feel regret.

45:05.560 --> 45:09.360
He delights in his power to commit murder.

45:10.480 --> 45:11.680
And you don’t?

45:18.200 --> 45:20.040
You guessed it. I do too.

45:22.320 --> 45:26.280
But I don’t try to make it seem
like this is all for the greater good.

45:28.320 --> 45:31.200
I don’t deceive myself or anyone else.

45:31.800 --> 45:35.080
I give a person
the right to be what he is.

45:36.080 --> 45:37.760
That is, an animal.

45:38.360 --> 45:40.120
Smart, stupid,

45:40.200 --> 45:41.840
brave, cowardly.

45:42.520 --> 45:44.120
An animal and that’s all.

45:45.160 --> 45:48.680
And the strong animal eats the weak one.
Isn’t that so?

45:49.440 --> 45:51.280
You aren’t full yet?

45:58.800 --> 46:01.520
I don’t kill just for pleasure.

46:01.600 --> 46:04.040
Of course. You have a mission.

46:04.760 --> 46:06.320
And why not?

46:07.480 --> 46:10.480
You think that only Meglin
can have a mission?

46:10.560 --> 46:12.280
He preserves life…

46:14.000 --> 46:15.800
and you snuff it out.

46:15.880 --> 46:17.520
Isn’t that an obvious difference?

46:17.600 --> 46:20.000
It’s obvious for a stupid girl like you.

46:22.720 --> 46:25.680
I don’t know if God exists.
Let’s assume he does.

46:27.600 --> 46:29.880
Then I’m his biggest victim.

46:31.840 --> 46:34.280
I don’t know why he punishes me
so harshly.

46:34.360 --> 46:38.760
Each time I create this horror,
it runs through me.

46:39.920 --> 46:42.840
I killed children
as they stared into my face,

46:42.920 --> 46:44.480
in front of their mothers’ eyes.

46:53.880 --> 46:55.640
How do I deserve that?

46:59.120 --> 47:01.960
Of course, Meglin saves lives.

47:02.680 --> 47:04.920
Only think, what’s the point?

47:05.520 --> 47:06.720
All of these…

47:08.000 --> 47:10.400
pathetic, insignificant pieces of meat

47:10.960 --> 47:15.040
who eat, sleep, and reproduce.

47:16.120 --> 47:17.720
And watch television.

47:18.560 --> 47:20.720
I need him to come into his own.

47:22.600 --> 47:25.200
I kill-- for the killing.

47:26.320 --> 47:29.120
But he kills-- for the saving.

47:30.120 --> 47:32.760
Each of us has our own mission.

47:34.200 --> 47:37.520
Deep down,
you’re just afraid to admit to yourself…

47:38.640 --> 47:40.120
that you’ve lost it…

47:41.440 --> 47:42.840
that the world works differently…

47:45.160 --> 47:48.600
that your whole philosophy
is just the drivel of a hurt child.

47:49.880 --> 47:52.040
Your parents fought often.

47:52.880 --> 47:56.200
They didn’t buy you toys
or take you to the zoo.

47:59.320 --> 48:00.320
They beat you.

48:00.400 --> 48:04.240
Your… peers teased you,

48:04.880 --> 48:06.800
and your teachers thought you were slow.

48:08.080 --> 48:10.240
Think, remember…

48:11.240 --> 48:14.040
and admit to yourself
that you’re a normal person…

48:15.360 --> 48:17.320
who wasn’t loved enough…

48:19.640 --> 48:22.000
and who’s afraid of death
like everyone else.

48:23.200 --> 48:24.800
Is that what he taught you?

48:27.320 --> 48:28.720
Stop.

48:30.040 --> 48:33.680
Think about this. You don’t have… do this.

48:36.600 --> 48:38.600
You really think I’m making a mistake?

48:40.240 --> 48:41.360
Really.

48:44.480 --> 48:46.560
Then say you aren’t afraid.

48:50.640 --> 48:51.640
I’m afraid.

49:00.720 --> 49:02.440
You know what he didn’t teach you?

49:04.080 --> 49:05.080
No.

49:06.280 --> 49:08.280
That not everyone wants love…

49:09.800 --> 49:11.320
and not everyone is afraid of death.

50:09.160 --> 50:10.440
Stop!

50:11.120 --> 50:13.280
Don’t take another step!
Weapons on the ground.

50:23.360 --> 50:24.960
You brought Papa for no reason. He wasn’t in the plans.

50:28.200 --> 50:30.720
No offense, Andrei Sergeyevich.

50:30.800 --> 50:32.280
No offense taken!

50:33.000 --> 50:34.400
What do you want?

50:34.480 --> 50:36.520
The question is, what do you want?

50:36.600 --> 50:38.680
Two of you can leave here.

50:38.760 --> 50:40.080
Choose.

50:41.400 --> 50:42.480
I’ve made my choice.

50:43.600 --> 50:45.920
Let them go. You didn’t understand me correctly,
Rodion.

50:49.800 --> 50:52.600
I don’t intend to stay behind either.

50:52.680 --> 50:54.080
Then it’s even simpler.

50:55.680 --> 50:57.680
-Esenya, leave.
-No.

50:58.280 --> 51:01.200
-Get out of here.
-Don’t yell at me.

51:04.920 --> 51:07.320
You get what you raise. Yeah.

51:08.560 --> 51:11.840
We’d better work something out.
I could be the only one to leave.

51:11.920 --> 51:14.600
-What’s the point then?
-Esenya.

51:15.560 --> 51:17.440
Your choice.

51:17.520 --> 51:19.560
Who do we start with?

51:19.640 --> 51:21.520
Haven’t you forgotten something?

51:23.360 --> 51:24.560
Remind me.

51:34.320 --> 51:35.720
Come on, come on!

51:43.760 --> 51:45.400
You owe me.

51:46.680 --> 51:48.080
You’re clever, Rodion.

51:51.760 --> 51:53.360
After all these years…

51:54.680 --> 51:56.560
I sensed you’d come back to haunt me.

52:02.200 --> 52:04.360
-Well?
-Let’s do it.

52:05.440 --> 52:06.640
Let’s do it.

52:07.960 --> 52:09.640
Andrei Sergeyevich,

52:10.240 --> 52:13.200
take the clip and ammo out of the gun
and put them on the floor.
