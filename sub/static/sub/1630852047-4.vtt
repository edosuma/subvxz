WEBVTT

00:06.132 --> 00:07.174
The Dragon has been

00:07.258 --> 00:08.467
<i>born again, and it's one of you.</i>

00:08.551 --> 00:11.762
<i>Our only chance is
to reach the White Tower</i>

00:11.846 --> 00:14.390
<i>and the other sisters
of the Aes Sedai.</i>

00:14.515 --> 00:16.308
This power,

00:16.392 --> 00:17.893
it's meant for women.

00:17.977 --> 00:20.646
What in Light's name? Go.

00:20.730 --> 00:22.189
I'll find you.

00:25.276 --> 00:26.777
I've heard
about the bond between

00:26.861 --> 00:28.070
<i>an Aes Sedai and her Warder.</i>

00:30.656 --> 00:31.657
Surely you've heard
of the Tinkers.

00:31.741 --> 00:33.951
The people who steal your gold

00:34.034 --> 00:35.870
<i>- and your children.
- I see you</i>

00:35.953 --> 00:37.413
<i>in my dreams-- all five of you--</i>

00:37.496 --> 00:38.873
but only one of you matters.

00:38.956 --> 00:40.291
- Only one of you can be it.
- Five?

00:40.374 --> 00:42.293
- Be what?
- The Dragon.

00:43.961 --> 00:46.172
You can't outrun a Fade.

00:48.591 --> 00:50.301
She's a Darkfriend, boy.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.136
Moiraine Sedai.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.804
Liandrin Sedai.

00:53.888 --> 00:55.723
We captured
a man calling himself

00:55.806 --> 00:57.141
<i>the Dragon Reborn.</i>

01:07.568 --> 01:09.111
He destroyed
the gates.

01:09.195 --> 01:10.905
His army's
everywhere.

01:14.867 --> 01:18.287
My king, we need
to get you away from here.

01:21.248 --> 01:24.210
- No. Come with me.
- Go!

02:22.142 --> 02:24.562
You will never wear
the silver crown.

02:25.688 --> 02:27.606
The crown?

02:27.690 --> 02:31.652
What does a crown mean
to the Dragon Reborn?

02:37.867 --> 02:40.369
You...

02:40.452 --> 02:42.872
you really believe it,
don't you?

02:42.955 --> 02:45.749
Be done
with it, Logain.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.794
I sent word
to the White Tower.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.839
The Aes Sedai will come for you.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.632
Those women.

02:54.675 --> 02:57.261
They should be following me,

02:57.344 --> 02:59.346
not fighting me.

03:05.227 --> 03:07.479
But they are afraid.

03:07.563 --> 03:11.817
Afraid the Dragon will
break the world again,

03:11.901 --> 03:16.280
throw us back
thousands of years,

03:16.363 --> 03:18.908
just like the last one did.

03:20.743 --> 03:23.329
They forget
the Dragon is just as likely

03:23.412 --> 03:25.539
to save the world

03:25.623 --> 03:28.208
as break it.

03:30.419 --> 03:33.339
You don't need to
convince this man of anything.

03:33.422 --> 03:35.341
He's beneath you.

03:35.424 --> 03:37.343
Kill him.

03:37.426 --> 03:39.553
You would like that.

03:42.348 --> 03:44.224
You've gone mad already.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.132
He'll betray you.

04:18.842 --> 04:21.261
Just like your parents.

04:21.345 --> 04:24.848
Just like your sister.

04:24.932 --> 04:29.436
None of them understand
who you are,

04:29.520 --> 04:31.772
what you're going to be.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.759
There's a place
for anyone at my side.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.140
Even my enemies.

05:09.935 --> 05:13.647
The last Dragon broke the world.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.984
But I plan to bind it.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.493
Thank you, Kerene.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.718
You've held back armies.

08:29.801 --> 08:32.763
Healing one wound
shouldn't have strained you.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.224
It hasn't.

08:35.307 --> 08:37.059
He has.

08:39.853 --> 08:43.482
I want to meet
this false Dragon.

08:43.565 --> 08:44.983
He may be false,

08:45.067 --> 08:47.486
but there are thousands
following him, true believers.

08:47.569 --> 08:49.446
But you don't
believe it, do you?

08:49.529 --> 08:52.282
Only Liandrin, Alanna
and I are strong enough

08:52.366 --> 08:55.118
to shield him
from using the One Power.

08:55.202 --> 08:58.247
Even then, we have
to work in pairs.

08:58.330 --> 09:00.874
Can he hear us?

09:00.958 --> 09:03.794
Hello to you, too.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.797
We plugged his ears
with weaves of air.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.840
I heard
he conquered half of Ghealdan

09:08.924 --> 09:11.677
and had the king himself
at his back.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.513
How did you get to him?

09:14.596 --> 09:16.598
A plan after your own heart.

09:16.682 --> 09:19.434
We crept into his camp
and shielded him as he slept.

09:19.518 --> 09:21.144
A little lightning,

09:21.228 --> 09:22.980
and his army all ran home
to their mothers.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.398
Let's hope so.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.483
I've set wards.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.819
They'll let us know
if anyone approaches.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.904
And the madness.

09:30.988 --> 09:32.489
How far gone is he?

09:32.572 --> 09:35.284
He's the same as any
man who can channel, worse even.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.744
He actually
proclaimed himself the Dragon

09:37.828 --> 09:39.496
and tried to march on the Tower.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.541
And we don't need a trial to
mete out the proper punishment.

09:42.624 --> 09:44.918
The Amyrlin Seat commanded us

09:45.002 --> 09:47.337
to bring him
to the Tower for trial.

09:47.421 --> 09:51.425
She will decide
what he deserves, not us.

09:58.140 --> 10:00.142
I've regained enough strength.

10:01.893 --> 10:03.812
Let me share the burden.

10:03.895 --> 10:08.400
That's Moiraine for you,
selfless to a fault.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.527
Hmm.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.363
We can't afford any gaps
in the shield.

10:13.447 --> 10:17.451
Liandrin will wait to drop hers
until yours is in place.

10:58.033 --> 11:01.161
You feel it now?
That's half his power.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.220
You're still dropping
that shoulder.

11:18.303 --> 11:21.598
It's too early
to be so tired.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.729
- How's life at the Tower?
-

11:27.813 --> 11:28.939
More problems.

11:29.981 --> 11:32.567
Fewer Aes Sedai to handle them.

11:32.651 --> 11:33.860
And the Amyrlin Seat?

11:33.944 --> 11:36.446
Still seated.

11:36.530 --> 11:38.907
Not any fonder
of Moiraine, though.

11:38.990 --> 11:43.703
I heard her threaten to fetch
you two home personally.

11:54.339 --> 11:57.259
Do you know, I never really
understood your taste

11:57.342 --> 11:59.261
in traveling companions.

11:59.344 --> 12:01.555
- She's not a companion.
- Oh.

12:01.638 --> 12:03.640
She's barely company.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.518
- Probably stubborn
as a mule, too.
-

12:10.564 --> 12:13.650
Cheap trick.

12:15.193 --> 12:18.280
I thought
the next shift was yours.

12:18.363 --> 12:21.450
Did Moiraine step in for you?

12:24.494 --> 12:27.831
If she's not careful,
she's going to win you over.

12:27.914 --> 12:31.418
I have nothing but respect
for Moiraine Sedai.

12:31.501 --> 12:35.213
Well, I'm sure your shifts
together will pass quickly then.

12:41.887 --> 12:44.931
Even if we had something
in common, I'd never know it.

12:45.015 --> 12:48.059
It's hard having a conversation
with someone

12:48.143 --> 12:50.187
who won't say anything.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.898
Lan is just as bad
when he wants to be.

12:54.232 --> 12:56.693
Can you imagine their dinners?

13:06.578 --> 13:09.539
Liandrin is gaining traction
with the others.

13:09.623 --> 13:12.667
We won't gentle Logain
without a trial.

13:12.751 --> 13:14.753
Rumor has it the Reds have been
doing just that

13:14.836 --> 13:16.463
across the countryside.

13:16.546 --> 13:21.510
Even Liandrin won't cross
the Amyrlin Seat.

13:23.553 --> 13:26.306
The Amyrlin isn't here.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.728
And you need to...

13:31.811 --> 13:35.482
And I promise
I'll get some rest.

13:36.858 --> 13:39.277
You worry more than you used to.

13:39.361 --> 13:43.782
I sleep less...
so I have the time.

14:06.972 --> 14:09.015
How'd you sleep?

14:09.099 --> 14:11.101
I didn't.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.399
Look, I don't trust
these people.

14:17.482 --> 14:19.776
There's something
about them that doesn't...

14:19.859 --> 14:22.362
If either of us feels
like we should go, we go,

14:22.445 --> 14:25.740
no questions, all right?

14:26.783 --> 14:30.203
We're heading east
for Tar Valon.

14:30.287 --> 14:32.205
You're welcome to join us...

14:32.289 --> 14:34.499
for as long as you can stand us.

14:34.583 --> 14:37.335
How do you know
we aren't bandits or worse?

14:37.419 --> 14:40.589
You were wandering
the Caralain Plain in rags

14:40.672 --> 14:43.300
without food or gold.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.802
If you're bandits,
you're not very good ones.

14:45.885 --> 14:49.723
It's not often villagers come
down from the Mountains of Mist.

14:49.806 --> 14:51.850
Uh, we're from Whitebridge.

14:51.933 --> 14:54.311
We got separated
from a trading caravan.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.354
Is that so?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.908
Coming?

15:31.306 --> 15:32.849
Hyah! Keep up.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.684
I think I see a farm up ahead.

15:36.728 --> 15:39.648
Hey, girl, shush.

15:39.731 --> 15:41.858
What's going on with you, huh?

15:43.360 --> 15:45.320
What's this gleeman doing
with us?

15:45.403 --> 15:47.947
First time we met him,
he stole our money.

15:48.031 --> 15:50.367
We sorted that out.

15:50.450 --> 15:54.537
He did save our lives...
if you recall.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.499
Did he? Dana said there were
Darkfriends everywhere,

15:57.582 --> 16:00.335
that a Fade was coming for us.

16:00.418 --> 16:02.671
What if he killed her
to make us trust him?

16:04.714 --> 16:07.467
Well, that would be... smart.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.262
Maybe there's some hope
for you after all.

16:12.889 --> 16:16.309
There was one other thing
that she said.

16:17.602 --> 16:20.980
That the Dragon could be one
of five of us.

16:21.064 --> 16:23.358
Me, you, Perrin, Egwene.

16:24.401 --> 16:27.070
Who else?

16:35.328 --> 16:37.580
You get used to it.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.500
He looks like
he's just sitting there.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.462
I mean, I always knew women
couldn't see men's weaves,

16:44.546 --> 16:46.881
but the experience
itself, it's...

16:46.965 --> 16:51.428
It's like holding
a cat in the bath.

16:52.595 --> 16:53.596
Yeah.

17:03.398 --> 17:06.317
You remember
that dog you had

17:06.401 --> 17:08.319
when we were Novices?

17:08.403 --> 17:10.196
What was her name?

17:11.656 --> 17:14.284
She wasn't mine.
Novices aren't allowed pets.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.120
But she slept every night
in your bed, though.

17:19.122 --> 17:21.082
I presume Kerene has asked you

17:21.166 --> 17:23.710
to use our friendship
to get information out of me.

17:23.793 --> 17:26.755
Not for a day or two still.

17:26.838 --> 17:29.883
When you're expecting it less.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.968
Subtle.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.970
You could have easily
been Blue Ajah.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.972
Please.

17:36.055 --> 17:39.100
One Warder
would never do.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.944
When I chose Green,

17:50.028 --> 17:53.114
I thought it was so heroic.

17:55.283 --> 17:57.410
The Battle Ajah...

17:57.494 --> 18:00.121
warriors trained
to defend humanity

18:00.205 --> 18:03.208
from the Dark One
at the Last Battle.

18:04.250 --> 18:07.837
But I never thought
I'd see it myself.

18:08.880 --> 18:12.175
There have been
false Dragons before.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.928
Women and men
who've claimed the title

18:15.011 --> 18:17.138
for power or personal gain.

18:19.140 --> 18:21.017
False or no...

18:22.519 --> 18:26.940
...his strength is more
than anything I've ever seen.

18:27.982 --> 18:29.984
It's just another sign.

18:34.322 --> 18:36.741
The end of this Age is here.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.207
If it is, and we find ourselves

18:44.290 --> 18:46.209
at the Last Battle...

18:47.710 --> 18:50.547
...I'm glad we'll have
your strength on our side.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.719
I know the last one
broke this world,

18:56.803 --> 18:58.721
and we can't let that
happen again,

18:58.805 --> 19:01.140
but what if the Dragon is
supposed to be there with us,

19:01.224 --> 19:03.893
but we've let the Reds
gentle him?

19:25.748 --> 19:27.876
Jenny.

19:27.959 --> 19:30.628
That was her name.

19:30.712 --> 19:33.965
The dog who wasn't your dog.

19:46.895 --> 19:49.147
I like your braid.

19:50.565 --> 19:53.401
It's Nynaeve, isn't it?

19:53.484 --> 19:55.111
Sorry if I'm mispronouncing it.

19:55.194 --> 19:58.031
I can't quite place the accent.

20:00.909 --> 20:03.036
That's because
you haven't heard me speak.

20:07.206 --> 20:10.793
I'm imagining you came over here
because you want something?

20:10.877 --> 20:13.212
You Aes Sedai always do.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.467
So I think
I'll ask the questions first.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.636
Depending on how well
you answer,

20:19.719 --> 20:21.888
maybe I'll give you
what you want.

20:25.016 --> 20:27.435
How long have you known
Moiraine?

20:34.609 --> 20:37.445
We wait until dark,
then sneak into the barn.

20:37.528 --> 20:39.113
Be out before sunrise.

20:39.197 --> 20:41.199
Wouldn't it be easier
to just ask?

20:41.282 --> 20:42.617
-
- Whoa.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.410
Figured you
for a better rider.

20:44.494 --> 20:46.162
Figured you
for a better horse thief.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.748
This mare's afraid
of her own shadow.

20:48.831 --> 20:49.832
A man
could get suspicious

20:49.916 --> 20:51.125
of strangers in his woods.

20:51.209 --> 20:53.127
We're just passing through.

20:53.211 --> 20:54.837
Most people stay
on their horse for that.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.881
We'll get back on them,
keep riding, if you let us.

20:56.965 --> 20:58.925
So you can double back at night?

20:59.008 --> 21:00.343
Quite a risk to me
and my family.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.345
Countryside's full of soldiers

21:02.428 --> 21:03.805
who abandoned that rebellion
in the South.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.854
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
We haven't been honest with you.

21:11.938 --> 21:15.483
We were going to rest
in your barn just for the night.

21:15.566 --> 21:17.652
You'd have never known
we were there.

21:20.571 --> 21:22.532
You don't want to kill us.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.450
If you did, you'd draw that bow

21:24.534 --> 21:26.703
with your fingertips,
not your fist.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.373
And if I wanted to kill you,

21:30.456 --> 21:32.542
I'd have kept my mouth shut
just now.

21:45.054 --> 21:47.181
Never did like this thing much.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.310
What do you say, love?

21:57.608 --> 21:59.610
Plenty of space in the barn...

22:00.695 --> 22:03.072
...once the stables
are mucked out.

22:08.953 --> 22:12.081
And she chose the Blue Ajah,

22:12.165 --> 22:13.833
which fits, really.

22:13.916 --> 22:16.169
They're nothing more
than little spies

22:16.252 --> 22:18.588
who exaggerate
their own importance.

22:18.671 --> 22:21.674
And the Reds are any different?

22:22.717 --> 22:26.679
We protect the world from people
who would misuse the One Power.

22:26.763 --> 22:28.765
Even other Aes Sedai.

22:29.807 --> 22:31.768
Liandrin.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.103
Mind if I join you?

22:34.187 --> 22:36.481
I was just leaving.

22:39.317 --> 22:41.319
The Red tent is open
to all women.

22:41.402 --> 22:43.654
Feel free to join us
for dinner...

22:44.989 --> 22:47.241
...if you tire of cold chicken.

22:50.078 --> 22:51.871
That woman's a snake.

22:51.954 --> 22:54.791
Is the White Tower
full of women like her?

22:54.874 --> 22:57.126
Uh, you'll find out soon enough.

22:57.210 --> 22:59.212
Will I? You took us half a day

22:59.295 --> 23:00.838
in the wrong direction
to get here.

23:00.922 --> 23:02.757
The Aes Sedai will get
Logain to the Tower

23:02.840 --> 23:05.009
as fast as they can.

23:05.093 --> 23:08.096
If your friends
aren't there already,

23:08.179 --> 23:11.265
there will be resources
we can use to find them.

23:14.143 --> 23:16.854
We promised we would.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.654
You are welcome
around our fire.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.948
If you promise not
to shove anyone into it.

23:34.205 --> 23:37.416
Have you seen
anyone else on the plains?

23:37.500 --> 23:39.877
You're lucky we saw you.
We usually don't pass this way,

23:39.961 --> 23:43.422
but there are soldiers
on the roads down South.

23:43.506 --> 23:46.634
A group this size should
be able to defend itself.

23:46.717 --> 23:49.262
Have you seen any weapons here?

23:52.431 --> 23:54.976
The Tuatha'an follow
the Way of the Leaf.

23:55.059 --> 23:56.894
Have for thousands of years.

23:56.978 --> 24:00.231
We forswear violence
and all instruments of it.

24:00.314 --> 24:02.400
What happens if you're attacked?

24:02.483 --> 24:06.612
We run if we can,
endure if we cannot.

24:07.613 --> 24:10.575
You'd let yourself be killed?

24:11.576 --> 24:15.204
"The leaf, in its time,
falls to the dirt

24:15.288 --> 24:17.999
that nourishes the tree
that, in its time,

24:18.082 --> 24:20.209
grows the leaf again."

24:20.293 --> 24:22.336
Nothing is ever lost.

24:23.337 --> 24:25.506
The Wheel returns all.

24:25.590 --> 24:30.344
As I heard every time
I lost a toy when I was a child.

24:30.428 --> 24:33.097
- I'm still waiting.
-

24:35.141 --> 24:37.101
Have you ever been in battle?

24:37.185 --> 24:40.521
Picked up a weapon?
A sword? Bow and arrow?

24:40.605 --> 24:42.315
An ax?

24:48.404 --> 24:52.283
And, tell me, has your life
been better or worse

24:52.366 --> 24:54.368
since you picked up that ax?

25:21.896 --> 25:24.232
Is he just
gonna stand there

25:24.315 --> 25:25.316
and let us do all the work?

25:27.068 --> 25:30.738
A gleeman must stay fresh
before a performance.

25:30.821 --> 25:32.448
Yeah, funny
how that offer came up

25:32.531 --> 25:34.533
when they were handing out
pitchforks.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.745
You all right?

25:39.747 --> 25:41.832
I need a break.

26:08.609 --> 26:10.903
I'm sorry. Mama sent me.

26:10.987 --> 26:14.448
Said to thank you and give you
this for all your hard work.

26:15.491 --> 26:17.702
Hey.

26:20.121 --> 26:24.208
No, um... I'm sorry.

26:24.292 --> 26:25.835
You, um...

26:25.918 --> 26:28.421
You surprised me is all.

26:30.256 --> 26:31.966
Thank you for the bread.

26:34.093 --> 26:36.012
What's your name?

26:36.095 --> 26:38.472
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?

26:38.556 --> 26:41.392
Mama says you're strange and
told me to give you her message

26:41.475 --> 26:43.394
and come right back.

26:43.477 --> 26:45.479
But you didn't.

26:46.981 --> 26:49.191
Yeah.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.610
My sisters never listen either.

26:52.653 --> 26:54.572
Where are they?

26:54.655 --> 26:58.159
Safe at home.

26:58.242 --> 27:00.911
With your mama and papa?

27:10.171 --> 27:12.506
You can take Birgitte
back for them.

27:12.590 --> 27:15.343
She protects me
when everyone's asleep.

27:16.844 --> 27:18.429
I can't take your doll.

27:18.512 --> 27:20.348
Oh, I have many more.

27:20.431 --> 27:23.601
Birgitte's always wanted
to see the world.

27:35.321 --> 27:38.324
Maybe he caught something
in Breen's Spring.

27:38.407 --> 27:41.327
I knew another lad the same way.

27:41.410 --> 27:44.872
Owyn, my nephew.

27:47.750 --> 27:51.337
Boy spent half his life
getting into trouble,

27:51.420 --> 27:53.798
the other half
getting out of it,

27:53.881 --> 27:56.884
and a good part of mine
helping him at both.

27:56.967 --> 28:01.263
Then, one day, he went sour.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.599
Snapping at family and friends.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.768
Jumping at shadows.

28:05.851 --> 28:07.895
Animals had their hair up
whenever he passed.

28:07.978 --> 28:11.023
Nobody could figure out
what happened

28:11.107 --> 28:13.901
until he threw a rock

28:13.984 --> 28:17.696
without using his hands.

28:21.242 --> 28:23.494
Mat's got all the signs, lad.

28:25.246 --> 28:27.331
Mat would tell me.

28:27.415 --> 28:29.542
He's not an idiot.

28:29.625 --> 28:31.419
Neither was Owyn.

28:31.502 --> 28:33.212
I'm a gleeman.

28:33.295 --> 28:34.630
Don't you think
I've told him the stories

28:34.713 --> 28:37.258
since he was a little boy?

28:37.341 --> 28:39.552
How at the end of the last Age,

28:39.635 --> 28:42.304
the Dark One corrupted
the One Power...

28:43.472 --> 28:47.184
...so men couldn't use it
without going mad?

28:47.268 --> 28:49.562
And still he lied to me.

28:55.317 --> 28:57.236
What happened to him?

28:57.319 --> 29:01.740
The Aes Sedai found him
while I was away.

29:04.368 --> 29:06.328
The Reds.

29:08.164 --> 29:10.291
They gentled him.

29:10.374 --> 29:14.253
Cut him off
from the One Power forever.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.966
He got to keep his life,
at least.

29:19.049 --> 29:23.637
Men, women both,
once they've tasted the Power,

29:23.721 --> 29:26.265
if they're cut off from it,
it's no life anymore.

29:26.348 --> 29:28.434
They just...

29:29.894 --> 29:31.854
...slip away.

29:31.937 --> 29:36.484
A few weeks
after those women left,

29:36.567 --> 29:40.946
Owyn was sitting
at the dinner table.

29:41.030 --> 29:43.574
He yawned.

29:45.201 --> 29:47.870
And then
he picked up a steak knife...

29:49.705 --> 29:52.875
...and slit his own throat,
like it was nothing at all.

29:58.172 --> 30:01.425
I'm gonna stay with you
as long as I can,

30:01.509 --> 30:04.386
keep you safe.

30:04.470 --> 30:07.348
But whatever we do, we have to
keep Mat away from those women.

30:12.561 --> 30:15.439
You know a lot
for a simple gleeman.

30:15.523 --> 30:17.608
We call ourselves gleemen

30:17.691 --> 30:20.653
because a silly name
makes us less frightening.

30:22.238 --> 30:26.784
Nothing is more dangerous
than a man who knows the past.

30:47.263 --> 30:48.597
-
- The mare flung him

30:48.681 --> 30:51.016
ten feet into a pig trough.

30:51.100 --> 30:54.728
And that was the end
of al'Lan Mandragoran,

30:54.812 --> 30:56.105
tamer of horses.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.237
- Fancy name.
- Yeah.

31:03.320 --> 31:04.530
For a shit horseman.

31:06.574 --> 31:08.867
So, how'd you get stuck
with him, tell me?

31:08.951 --> 31:10.869
Uh, Moiraine and I were
traveling past her village,

31:10.953 --> 31:12.413
and...

31:12.496 --> 31:13.497
I tracked him.

31:15.249 --> 31:17.084
I like her.

31:20.588 --> 31:22.798
You Warders are more fun
than you look.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.466
Except me, of course.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.218
I look fun.

31:26.302 --> 31:28.137
Uh, don't encourage him.

31:38.480 --> 31:41.275
But you serve them.

31:45.654 --> 31:48.282
We don't.

31:52.953 --> 31:57.583
No bond is closer than an
Aes Sedai and, uh, her Warder.

31:58.709 --> 32:02.671
Not husbands and wives,

32:02.755 --> 32:04.965
not parents and children.

32:05.966 --> 32:09.928
Do you know what "Aes Sedai"
means in the Old Tongue?

32:12.222 --> 32:14.433
"Servants of All."

32:16.977 --> 32:19.521
It is they who serve the world.

32:21.523 --> 32:23.817
And what does that make you?

32:23.901 --> 32:25.861
Proud.

32:28.030 --> 32:29.990
And tired.

32:32.201 --> 32:34.286
Especially Lan.

32:34.370 --> 32:35.996
How he keeps up with Moiraine.

32:38.165 --> 32:39.583
You should talk.

32:48.133 --> 32:50.302
He's right.

32:50.386 --> 32:52.179
We're exhausted.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.984
The three of them don't...?

33:10.364 --> 33:12.199
I'm feeling a bit

33:12.282 --> 33:14.952
tired myself.

33:47.526 --> 33:50.028
He is ten years too old
at least.

33:50.112 --> 33:52.531
Is he as strong as Egwene?

33:55.033 --> 33:56.952
I don't know.

33:57.035 --> 34:00.998
I don't think so,
but I don't know.

34:03.292 --> 34:07.671
Oh. The dreams, Trollocs.

34:09.590 --> 34:11.175
The Dark One isn't after Logain.

34:11.258 --> 34:13.469
Perhaps He is.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.639
I don't think the Dark One
has any more idea

34:17.723 --> 34:19.725
who the Dragon is than we do.

34:23.645 --> 34:27.649
I don't know if that's
terrifying or comforting. Hmm.

34:31.487 --> 34:33.489
We lost them.

34:34.490 --> 34:37.910
Twenty years we hunted,
and we lost them.

34:37.993 --> 34:39.661
I lost them.

34:39.745 --> 34:42.414
Your losses are mine.

34:42.498 --> 34:44.500
And mine yours.

34:52.883 --> 34:54.968
I shouldn't have had a drink.

34:57.012 --> 34:59.515
You always get emotional
when I drink.

35:44.393 --> 35:45.853
Come on.

35:51.316 --> 35:53.944
Everyone keeps talking
about "the Song."

35:54.027 --> 35:55.654
What is it?

35:55.737 --> 35:58.824
Ah, it's, it's nothing.
It's a silly tradition.

35:58.907 --> 36:01.994
Well, your grandparents seem
pretty serious about it.

36:02.995 --> 36:05.998
In the last Age, our people
supposedly knew a song

36:06.081 --> 36:08.208
that brought harmony
to the world.

36:08.292 --> 36:10.836
It was lost in the Breaking,

36:10.919 --> 36:12.838
but if we can only
find it again,

36:12.921 --> 36:15.966
people will live
in peace and happiness

36:16.049 --> 36:17.593
for the rest of their days.

36:19.803 --> 36:21.722
You don't believe it.

36:21.805 --> 36:23.765
There's a lot I believe in,

36:23.849 --> 36:27.519
but only old fools and children
believe in the Song.

36:30.022 --> 36:32.357
Are you sure
you haven't already found it?

36:47.247 --> 36:48.248
Thank you.

36:48.332 --> 36:50.542
You honor us.

36:50.626 --> 36:52.628
Anyone can do that.

36:53.670 --> 36:55.631
You find peace in the work.

36:55.714 --> 36:57.257
That's the honor.

37:06.016 --> 37:09.061
Some of your people
don't look so peaceful.

37:13.190 --> 37:16.526
Sarai was a hired killer.

37:16.610 --> 37:18.278
Those who renounce violence

37:18.362 --> 37:21.281
usually know its evil
only too well.

37:21.365 --> 37:24.201
There are some things
you can't run away from.

37:25.243 --> 37:27.454
We're not running.

37:27.537 --> 37:30.248
There's only one way
to end violence.

37:30.332 --> 37:33.502
Everybody everywhere
has to stop.

37:34.628 --> 37:36.672
And it will take time.

37:41.635 --> 37:44.888
You really think
that's possible?

37:44.972 --> 37:48.141
If I can change two
people's minds, just two,

37:48.225 --> 37:52.479
well, then I've left the world
a better place than I found.

37:52.562 --> 37:55.190
And if those two each change
two more minds,

37:55.273 --> 37:57.192
well, then, eventually...

37:57.275 --> 38:00.612
Even if you're right, you won't
live to see this peace.

38:00.696 --> 38:03.240
I don't do it for myself.

38:03.323 --> 38:05.701
And neither will the rest
of your people here,

38:05.784 --> 38:07.327
or their grandchildren,

38:07.411 --> 38:09.162
or their great-grandchildren's
grandchildren.

38:09.246 --> 38:11.707
I love my people,

38:11.790 --> 38:15.168
but I don't do this
for them either.

38:15.252 --> 38:17.796
Well, then for who?

38:22.592 --> 38:24.553
I had a daughter.

38:24.636 --> 38:26.596
Aram's mother.

38:26.680 --> 38:30.851
He doesn't even remember.

38:30.934 --> 38:34.730
One day she went out foraging,
and bandits stumbled on her.

38:37.607 --> 38:40.736
She had no gold, no jewels,

38:40.819 --> 38:44.948
nothing... of value
except her life.

38:48.994 --> 38:51.288
When I found her, I could tell

38:51.371 --> 38:54.624
that they'd killed her
for sport.

39:00.380 --> 39:02.758
I sat with her body
for hours, just staring

39:02.841 --> 39:05.343
at the broken spear
in her chest.

39:05.427 --> 39:07.554
Trying to work up the courage
to grab it

39:07.637 --> 39:12.517
and hunt down the beasts,
as they had hunted her.

39:12.601 --> 39:14.853
Why didn't you?

39:16.855 --> 39:18.815
Because I wanted revenge.

39:18.899 --> 39:22.611
That doesn't sound
like the Way of the Leaf.

39:27.491 --> 39:31.119
What greater revenge
against violence than peace?

39:31.203 --> 39:36.583
What greater revenge
against death than life?

39:38.627 --> 39:40.879
I couldn't protect my girl
in this turn of the Wheel,

39:40.962 --> 39:43.882
but one day,
long after I'm gone,

39:43.965 --> 39:48.178
after Aram and his
grandchildren's grandchildren,

39:48.261 --> 39:53.350
the Wheel will turn out
my daughter's soul again.

39:57.521 --> 40:00.107
I do what I can to forge
a better world for her then,

40:00.190 --> 40:05.278
where she can enjoy the life
she should have had with me.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.421
Who is he?

40:24.422 --> 40:26.758
The man that holds your heart?

40:33.890 --> 40:35.684
Have you lost him?

40:39.104 --> 40:41.106
No.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.944
No, I'd know if I had.

40:52.325 --> 40:56.413
You know, we leave the wagons
when we turn 20.

40:56.496 --> 40:58.790
To live in the world
for a while,

40:58.874 --> 41:02.085
see if what we were born into
is what we would choose.

41:05.672 --> 41:07.674
Some farm.

41:07.757 --> 41:10.343
Some set sail.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.807
Some even take up arms, I hear.

41:20.896 --> 41:23.565
How many come home?

41:23.648 --> 41:24.858
Most.

41:24.941 --> 41:27.027
But not all.

41:30.030 --> 41:32.240
Leaf doesn't fight the wind.

41:34.201 --> 41:38.121
And sometimes the wind
blows away from the tree.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.437
I'm here.

42:02.520 --> 42:05.315
You know that, right?

42:05.398 --> 42:08.193
No matter what happens,
I'm here.

42:32.467 --> 42:34.386
Perrin!

42:36.638 --> 42:37.639
Stop!

42:42.644 --> 42:44.062
Mat?

42:44.145 --> 42:46.356
- Mat!
- Rand.

42:46.439 --> 42:47.774
Rand.

42:47.857 --> 42:49.651
- No.
-

42:49.734 --> 42:52.737
-
- It's all right. I got you.

42:52.821 --> 42:53.738
I got you.

42:56.199 --> 42:58.368
Where's Mat?

43:18.847 --> 43:20.098
Grab him.

43:20.181 --> 43:21.808
Let's get out of here now.

43:26.354 --> 43:27.731
I see you.

43:27.814 --> 43:29.441
The Fade!

43:32.527 --> 43:33.570
Get him out of here!

43:33.653 --> 43:34.487
Come on.

43:37.073 --> 43:38.867
Go!

43:39.909 --> 43:41.578
Run!

43:49.586 --> 43:52.088
- What?
- Come on.

43:52.172 --> 43:53.089
Come on.

43:53.173 --> 43:55.884
Run. Run.

43:55.967 --> 43:58.011
Run.
Run.

44:50.980 --> 44:53.108
You've spoken to everyone else.

44:54.275 --> 44:57.904
Did you plan to talk to me?

44:59.948 --> 45:02.409
It's far harder
to keep a shield on someone

45:02.492 --> 45:04.327
than to break out of it.

45:05.829 --> 45:07.747
Look at him.

45:07.831 --> 45:11.418
Not a bead of sweat on his brow,
not a tremor in his lip,

45:11.501 --> 45:13.420
while we're almost ragged.

45:15.463 --> 45:20.093
We have hundreds of miles yet
to the White Tower.

45:20.176 --> 45:24.597
You really think we can keep
this up the whole way?

45:26.766 --> 45:29.060
If he were to break out,

45:29.144 --> 45:31.938
the Three Oaths would allow us
to gentle him.

45:36.025 --> 45:39.612
The White Tower and the women
within it have stood

45:39.696 --> 45:41.614
for 3,000 years,

45:41.698 --> 45:44.409
not because we do
what is expedient

45:44.492 --> 45:47.162
but because we do what is right.

45:50.248 --> 45:53.626
The law applies to us
just as much as it does to him.

45:53.710 --> 45:57.797
And you, a Red, should be
the one reminding me of that,

45:57.881 --> 46:00.550
not the other way around.

46:36.794 --> 46:39.631
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to intrude.

46:40.632 --> 46:43.259
You didn't.

46:43.343 --> 46:45.345
What was that?

46:46.346 --> 46:49.557
It's a ritual of my people.

46:52.060 --> 46:55.104
Seven times for
the Seven Towers of Malkier...

46:56.147 --> 47:00.360
...for the home we lost...
the home we shall find again.

47:01.819 --> 47:03.821
In this life or the next.

47:10.703 --> 47:12.705
You pray often?

47:14.874 --> 47:17.418
When I need to.

47:28.638 --> 47:33.393
<i>Ayend'an Atha'an'shari'a marath
allende'nesodhin an'ara'rhiod</i>

47:33.476 --> 47:38.022
<i>e'fel loviyagae
zavilat'a'veren Ba'asa.</i>

47:40.525 --> 47:42.944
Well, I didn't know
you knew the Old Tongue.

47:45.154 --> 47:47.198
I don't.

47:49.867 --> 47:51.619
It's the last thing
my parents ever said to me

47:51.703 --> 47:54.330
when they hid me in the cellar
during an attack on our village.

47:58.167 --> 48:01.087
I used to say it
whenever I was scared.

48:01.170 --> 48:02.463
Why did you stop?

48:02.547 --> 48:05.758
People don't go
to Wisdoms for ignorance.

48:05.842 --> 48:08.970
I don't even know
what the words mean.

48:09.053 --> 48:11.306
Do you want to?

48:20.189 --> 48:22.942
It's what the last king of
Manetheren said to his wife...

48:24.694 --> 48:26.904
...before the battle
they knew they'd lose.

48:30.033 --> 48:32.410
"We shall go into the land..."

48:33.703 --> 48:36.205
"...so our children
can always hold us..."

48:37.248 --> 48:39.167
"...and will never be alone."

48:55.058 --> 48:59.020
You're not exactly
what I thought you were,

48:59.103 --> 49:01.356
al'Lan Mandragoran.

49:02.357 --> 49:04.233
And what was that?

49:04.317 --> 49:06.361
A lapdog with two legs.

49:09.947 --> 49:12.075
Hmm.

49:13.910 --> 49:19.082
Well, you are exactly
what I thought you were,

49:19.165 --> 49:21.000
Wisdom al'Meara.

49:21.084 --> 49:23.836
And what is that?

49:30.009 --> 49:32.512
Wait.

49:38.309 --> 49:40.895
- What is it?
- My wards.

49:40.978 --> 49:43.773
Looks like his army didn't run
home to their mothers after all.

49:52.907 --> 49:55.159
Logain's army,
they're here.

49:55.243 --> 49:57.161
- How many of them are there?
- Don't worry.

49:57.245 --> 49:59.706
I'll save some for you.

50:26.691 --> 50:30.778
No army can get past
seven full sisters.

50:38.703 --> 50:39.746
Logain.

50:39.829 --> 50:41.581
We need to get to the cave.

50:41.664 --> 50:43.750
To the Dragon!

50:53.593 --> 50:55.511
- Let's go.
- Move.

51:22.455 --> 51:24.415
There.

52:06.749 --> 52:07.750
Come on.

52:35.862 --> 52:37.572
The others will be here soon,

52:37.655 --> 52:40.324
so we don't have
much time to talk.

52:48.749 --> 52:51.836
Why should I believe
you're the Dragon Reborn?

52:57.341 --> 52:59.552
I can hear them when I channel.

53:02.263 --> 53:04.265
All of them.

53:05.308 --> 53:09.604
Whispers of a thousand Dragons
that preceded me,

53:09.687 --> 53:13.232
a thousand lives... I've led.

53:16.569 --> 53:20.364
And they're teaching me
how to do better this time.

53:20.448 --> 53:24.702
Isn't that why the Wheel turns
our spirits out again and again?

53:26.579 --> 53:28.581
To learn.

53:29.624 --> 53:31.709
The Wheel doesn't want anything.

53:32.710 --> 53:34.712
It can't.

53:35.838 --> 53:38.257
Any more than a river
or the rain can want something.

53:38.341 --> 53:41.052
It's people who want.

53:48.225 --> 53:50.937
What do you want?

53:54.982 --> 53:58.027
I want you to know
that the voices in your head...

54:00.655 --> 54:02.782
...those are the whispers
of madness.

54:02.865 --> 54:06.702
And as strong as you are,

54:06.786 --> 54:09.997
your power is a trickle.

54:12.416 --> 54:16.253
It's a pinprick of candlelight
against the raging sun

54:16.337 --> 54:18.381
that will be the Dragon Reborn.

54:39.735 --> 54:41.404
No!

55:36.751 --> 55:39.295
- Go, get to Logain!
- Kerene.

55:39.378 --> 55:41.380
We'll hold the army!

55:42.381 --> 55:44.050
-
- Come on.

56:17.708 --> 56:19.877
Liandrin,
you're drawing too much.

56:19.960 --> 56:21.337
You'll burn out.

56:21.420 --> 56:22.880
I don't care.

56:22.963 --> 56:24.381
He killed our sister,

56:24.465 --> 56:28.052
and I will cut him... down.

56:42.483 --> 56:43.567
Stepin!

57:25.317 --> 57:27.862
No.

57:31.740 --> 57:33.617
No.

57:35.411 --> 57:40.207
No...!

58:07.568 --> 58:10.779
Like a raging sun.

58:17.077 --> 58:20.581
Link with me! Now!

58:34.553 --> 58:36.847
Let the hand
of the Tower fall

58:36.931 --> 58:39.725
on you, Logain Ablar,

58:39.808 --> 58:42.603
and take back
that which nature itself

58:42.686 --> 58:45.147
does not wish you to hold!
