[yelling]

02:49.901 --> 02:52.101
Madam Ye! We must take
the kids and leave!

02:52.103 --> 02:53.869
Now. To the basement.

02:53.871 --> 02:54.871
- [clamoring]
- Move fast.

02:54.873 --> 02:57.376
Everybody, hurry. Come. Now.

03:01.078 --> 03:01.980
Come on, dear.

03:24.936 --> 03:26.037
[man] Here you go.

03:27.839 --> 03:28.707
Huh?

03:29.173 --> 03:30.909
Manguan Xue?

03:32.377 --> 03:34.679
Because I lost this darn place to you,
it doesn't mean you can lock me out.

03:35.746 --> 03:37.683
- Come on.
- [continues knocking]

03:41.119 --> 03:43.089
- [all] Whoa!

03:43.488 --> 03:44.820
Lucky, you okay?

03:44.822 --> 03:45.791
[bird squeaks]

03:46.792 --> 03:48.492
Did it give you a big scare?

03:48.494 --> 03:50.026
[Lucky] Uh-uh.

03:50.028 --> 03:51.898
Don't worry, boy.
This tea house is still ours.

03:52.597 --> 03:54.196
Even though
their name's on the door.

03:54.198 --> 03:55.532
We won it fair and square.

03:55.534 --> 03:56.766
[Lucky] Yaogu cheats.

03:56.768 --> 03:59.772

Nine bamboos.

04:12.583 --> 04:13.485
Hey, hey, honey.

04:14.252 --> 04:15.954
Tell me then, Yaogu Xue.

04:16.755 --> 04:19.589
What were you secretly discussing
in the tea room earlier?

04:19.591 --> 04:20.493
Ah... Oh.

04:22.260 --> 04:24.027
Why would I tell you?

04:24.029 --> 04:25.594
Well, why would you have
any reason not to tell me?

04:25.596 --> 04:27.733
- [siren continues blaring]
- [clamoring]

05:07.873 --> 05:09.709
[crying]

05:16.781 --> 05:18.113
How many pilots
do we have left?

05:18.115 --> 05:19.284
Fifteen left, sir.

05:20.151 --> 05:21.019
How many planes?

05:22.019 --> 05:24.990
Thirteen I-16s, one I-15,
two in repair.

05:25.190 --> 05:26.659
We're recruiting
as we speak, sir.

05:28.026 --> 05:31.096
We are soldiers, Colonel. Protecting
our country in war is our job.

05:31.663 --> 05:32.762
I know how you feel.

05:32.764 --> 05:34.798
You have to be rational.

05:34.800 --> 05:37.770
Can't just send these kids
up there to get shot down.

05:38.002 --> 05:39.805
I need you two. Both of you.

05:41.038 --> 05:42.575
If we don't take action,

05:43.207 --> 05:45.710
the Japanese will continue
to bomb Chongqing.

05:45.978 --> 05:47.245
How could we face our people?

05:47.979 --> 05:49.214
We need more planes.

05:49.748 --> 05:51.817
And we need to get those kids
out there trained.

05:52.183 --> 05:53.318
Nobody flies today.

05:55.053 --> 05:56.022
Sir?

05:57.288 --> 05:58.990
Please allow us
to go kick some ass.

06:15.007 --> 06:15.908
Let's go!

06:32.423 --> 06:35.058
We're barely making a dent.
How do we take them out?

06:35.060 --> 06:36.262
Shoot the fuel tanks.

06:51.375 --> 06:52.344
Yeah!

07:01.420 --> 07:03.889
- What kind of planes are those, Captain?
- The new Zeros.

07:04.389 --> 07:06.091
Argh!

07:07.959 --> 07:09.829
Watch out! Incoming for you.

07:11.729 --> 07:12.697
[groans]

07:16.767 --> 07:17.837
No!

07:24.276 --> 07:25.411
I can't shake this guy.

07:26.712 --> 07:27.913
I got you covered.

07:41.860 --> 07:43.293
Lei Tao!

07:43.295 --> 07:45.398
My brother, I'm not gonna
make it back for dinner.

07:48.899 --> 07:50.101
Lei Tao!

08:01.378 --> 08:02.280
Ugh!

08:14.091 --> 08:15.226
[in Japanese]

08:16.461 --> 08:17.396
[grunts]

08:42.052 --> 08:43.755
[thunder clapping]

08:51.463 --> 08:52.798
Ten-hut!

09:06.545 --> 09:08.443
I promise
to avenge you, brother.

09:08.445 --> 09:09.781
[sniffles]

09:14.051 --> 09:16.087
[in Japanese]

[tapping]

10:04.235 --> 10:06.004
[Morse code beeps]

10:10.242 --> 10:12.308
Vice-captain Gangtou Xue,
22nd Squadron.

10:12.310 --> 10:14.914
Reporting from the 4th Battalion.
At your service.

10:16.580 --> 10:19.882
[officer] <i>Captain Xue, since you
are unable to fight due to injury,</i>

10:19.884 --> 10:22.552
<i>the air force has loaned you
to us for a special mission.</i>

10:22.554 --> 10:25.020
[Gangtou] <i>I'm at your command,
sir.</i>

10:25.022 --> 10:27.122
[officer] <i>Tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.,
you will go down to the port</i>

10:27.124 --> 10:30.296
<i>and take truck 82560
back to Chongqing.</i>

10:30.494 --> 10:32.595
<i>The Japanese planes
are patrolling the roads,</i>

10:32.597 --> 10:34.329
<i>firing upon
anything that moves.</i>

10:34.331 --> 10:36.566
<i>It is extremely dangerous.</i>

10:36.568 --> 10:39.001
[Gangtou] <i>I understand, sir.</i>

10:39.003 --> 10:42.170
[officer] <i>Your mission is to ensure that
truck gets to Chongqing in one piece.</i>

10:42.172 --> 10:44.209
[indistinct chatter]

10:54.585 --> 10:56.955
[clamoring]

10:59.456 --> 11:01.860
[grunting]

11:11.368 --> 11:12.338
[scream]

11:19.176 --> 11:20.111
Gangtou?

11:20.578 --> 11:21.579
Little Cui?

11:22.247 --> 11:24.414
What in heaven's name
is going on?

11:24.416 --> 11:26.919
I'm supposed to safeguard this truck.
I didn't expect to see you.

11:38.997 --> 11:40.031
[groans]

11:42.666 --> 11:43.569
[grunts]

11:49.607 --> 11:50.910
Go over there.

11:52.710 --> 11:54.178
[groans]

11:55.146 --> 11:56.448
Drive straight on through.

12:01.219 --> 12:03.088
[Jack] Pilots of China,

12:03.387 --> 12:07.091
we have reached a very critical
time in this war with the Japanese.

12:08.158 --> 12:10.592
I don't expect any of you new
trainees to get up there

12:10.594 --> 12:12.662
and take down
every Zero you see,

12:12.664 --> 12:15.365
but I do want you to take
this training very seriously.

12:15.367 --> 12:16.267
Yes, sir.

12:16.734 --> 12:19.137
We are here to avenge
our family and comrades.

12:20.104 --> 12:21.272
Who told you to speak?

12:22.574 --> 12:24.008
That's not why you're here.

12:24.309 --> 12:27.209
You are here
to protect your families,

12:27.211 --> 12:30.112
your mothers, your fathers,
your children,

12:30.114 --> 12:33.017
from having the bombs dropped
on them from the Japanese.

12:33.283 --> 12:34.483
That's your job.

12:34.485 --> 12:36.052
What do you know
about these planes?

12:36.054 --> 12:37.486
I know I can put up a fight.

12:37.488 --> 12:39.959
I know that once you reach
the combat zone,

12:41.059 --> 12:43.161
you have a very short
life expectancy.

12:44.461 --> 12:46.631
Five days, if that.

12:48.233 --> 12:51.502
I don't wanna be attending your funeral
or any of these men's funerals.

12:53.204 --> 12:54.138
At ease.

12:55.573 --> 12:58.173
This Yank thinks he's a hardass.
Don't take it personally.

12:58.175 --> 13:00.345
So you're
the new target practice?

13:01.079 --> 13:02.013
Huh?

13:07.285 --> 13:08.654
Think shooting Zeros is easy?

13:09.186 --> 13:10.355
You think it's a piece of cake?

13:14.258 --> 13:15.693
He's worse than the American.

13:20.330 --> 13:21.233
Let's go.

13:22.499 --> 13:23.401
Hold on.

13:25.070 --> 13:26.068
You're hiding something.

13:26.070 --> 13:27.138
Why do you say that?

13:30.307 --> 13:31.340
What's in this truck?

13:31.342 --> 13:32.244
Medicine.

13:34.112 --> 13:36.111
I know you're lying.
What's in there?

13:36.113 --> 13:37.079
I told you.

13:37.081 --> 13:38.216
You think I'm naive, huh?

13:39.684 --> 13:41.487
Gangtou? Gangtou!

13:44.789 --> 13:46.558
Gangtou, do not open that!

13:47.392 --> 13:48.393
They'll court-martial you.

13:49.359 --> 13:50.428
Where's your soldier's honor?

13:55.200 --> 13:57.265
Medicine, huh?

13:57.267 --> 13:58.704
Why can't you just believe what
somebody tells you for once?

13:59.170 --> 14:00.406
I told you the deal.

14:00.704 --> 14:03.242
I get my wife once I deliver.

14:05.609 --> 14:07.478
And I'm entering
the mahjong contest.

14:08.479 --> 14:11.149
I'm gonna win back our tea
house once and for all.

14:12.483 --> 14:14.851
So you have a plan
to beat my sister-in-law?

14:14.853 --> 14:18.121
Ha! She's just a cheater and a bragger.
Everyone knows how she won.

14:18.123 --> 14:19.557
Did I ever tell you
how she did it?

14:20.358 --> 14:21.392
[gasps]

14:22.193 --> 14:23.693
Is this truck
going to Chongqing?

14:23.695 --> 14:25.895
I've been trying to
hitch a ride for two days.

14:25.897 --> 14:28.430
You can run over me if you like.
I'm not leaving.

14:28.432 --> 14:29.767
I like the sound of that.

14:33.771 --> 14:34.673
All right!

14:35.573 --> 14:37.209
It's all right. Easy now.

14:39.410 --> 14:40.312
[sighs]

14:41.179 --> 14:43.281
Officer, could you please
do me a favor?

14:45.517 --> 14:51.256
Deliver these two English pigs to Director Liu
of the National Livestock Research Center.

14:52.156 --> 14:53.257
Professor Chun's my name.

14:56.360 --> 14:57.495
I did my job.

15:07.472 --> 15:09.374
[pigs grunting]

15:09.907 --> 15:10.808
What do you do?

15:16.214 --> 15:17.914
[Gangtou] So you're
an expert in livestock?

15:17.916 --> 15:19.715
[Chun] Not really.

15:19.717 --> 15:22.221
The research I've done
focuses on selective breeding.

15:22.487 --> 15:24.553
I brought these two piglets
back from England.

15:24.555 --> 15:27.823
They have a high meat-to-fat
ratio, about 55% or so.

15:27.825 --> 15:29.524
If the experiment
works as planned...

15:29.526 --> 15:31.662
But right now,
human life matters the most.

15:32.229 --> 15:33.395
Pigs are worthless.

15:33.397 --> 15:35.200
You deal in fighting wars,

15:35.599 --> 15:37.567
I deal in porcine research.

15:37.569 --> 15:40.671
[airplane roaring]

15:47.211 --> 15:49.547
[indistinct chatter]

16:04.494 --> 16:06.495
[engine sputters and stops]

16:06.497 --> 16:08.901
[engine stalling]

16:14.238 --> 16:18.343
Officer, I'll repair your
truck in return for a ride.

16:18.542 --> 16:19.574
Piss off!

16:19.576 --> 16:21.212
Why don't you let him try?

16:21.411 --> 16:23.779
We can't stay stuck here.
We'll definitely get bombed.

16:23.781 --> 16:25.448
- [airplane roaring]
- [crowd screaming]

16:25.450 --> 16:26.584
[man] Planes are coming!

16:34.325 --> 16:36.458
Well? Hurry up.

16:36.460 --> 16:37.796
[engine sputtering]

16:39.998 --> 16:41.264
[engine revving]

16:41.266 --> 16:42.534
Ha! Yes!

17:03.421 --> 17:04.623
Get out of my truck!

17:06.324 --> 17:07.226
Get the hell out!

17:27.010 --> 17:28.511
[gasps, strains]

17:28.512 --> 17:29.781
[screaming]

17:41.491 --> 17:43.295
Get out. Come here.

17:43.628 --> 17:46.594
Look down there. See where
you almost put us, huh?

17:46.596 --> 17:47.498
Officer...

17:48.399 --> 17:50.699
Sir, I'm a mechanic
and a good driver.

17:50.701 --> 17:52.938
You have my word,
this will never happen again.

18:04.548 --> 18:05.549
Attention.

18:06.817 --> 18:08.516
I'm taking away
your flying privileges.

18:08.518 --> 18:10.453
You have to let me know
what I did wrong.

18:10.455 --> 18:12.357
- You really don't know?
- No, I don't.

18:13.725 --> 18:16.395
- [Jack] <i>What was your altitude?</i>
- <i>Forty-five hundred.</i>

18:16.626 --> 18:18.960
- [Jack] <i>AOT?</i>
- <i>Fifteen degrees.</i>

18:18.962 --> 18:20.496
- [Jack] <i>How fast were you supposed to be going?</i>
- <i>One hundred.</i>

18:20.498 --> 18:21.563
[Jack] <i>And you were going?</i>

18:21.565 --> 18:22.497
Ninety.

18:22.499 --> 18:23.434
[grunts]

18:24.701 --> 18:26.070
So you do know the difference.

18:26.938 --> 18:28.707
You still wanna ask me
what you did wrong?

18:30.674 --> 18:32.443
You crying about
your dead brother?

18:32.809 --> 18:34.046
Your brother you got killed?

18:35.546 --> 18:39.950
Is it just that I'm treating you too
harshly, or are you just feeling shitty?

18:41.052 --> 18:42.454
I'm feeling shitty.

18:42.819 --> 18:44.488
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

18:44.788 --> 18:46.657
- I'm feeling shitty!
- Good!

18:46.891 --> 18:49.594
That's what I want! Now get
the fuck out of here now!

18:52.462 --> 18:53.498
I'm sorry.

18:55.165 --> 18:56.334
I was wrong.

19:12.850 --> 19:13.752
[door closes]

19:33.871 --> 19:35.040
Quick. Come on, come on.

19:36.106 --> 19:37.441
Come here. Hurry.

19:42.913 --> 19:44.548
Hey! Wait up, don't leave!

19:45.682 --> 19:46.584
Come on, children.

19:47.017 --> 19:48.586
- [tires screech]
- [gasping]

19:50.854 --> 19:52.156
What's going on?

19:52.623 --> 19:54.392
There's a pretty young girl
walking down the road.

19:54.624 --> 19:56.758
Stop gawking. Drive on.

19:56.760 --> 19:57.895
Where are you going, my friends?

19:58.196 --> 19:59.498
Chongqing.

19:59.896 --> 20:01.432
We could take them
with us, right?

20:03.167 --> 20:04.136
I call the shots here.

20:06.571 --> 20:07.902
I'll pay their fare.

20:07.904 --> 20:09.103
It's not about
the money, Professor.

20:09.105 --> 20:10.906
Be quiet. You don't have
a say here.

20:10.908 --> 20:12.975
Give me one good reason
not to take them.

20:12.977 --> 20:14.646
- Why would I?
- Because.

20:19.816 --> 20:21.819
Did you join the army
just to look tough, Officer?

20:22.786 --> 20:24.922
Protecting women and children
is a soldier's duty.

20:25.489 --> 20:27.057
You have to take these children
with you.

20:27.892 --> 20:29.524
Why is that?

20:29.526 --> 20:31.430
Because their dads are soldiers
like you.

20:31.696 --> 20:33.732
[indistinct chatter]

20:34.931 --> 20:36.668
Ooh. Nice coupling.

20:37.535 --> 20:40.872
Impressive. And look at
all these people. [chuckles]

20:42.573 --> 20:44.073
How many have signed up, huh?

20:44.075 --> 20:45.841
Ah, Uncle Cui. Hi.

20:45.843 --> 20:47.679
Are you signing up, too, Cui?

20:48.179 --> 20:50.813
Oh, come on now.
His gambling days are over.

20:50.815 --> 20:52.915
We mustn't encourage him
to start playing again.

20:52.917 --> 20:54.917
I'm here to sign up for my son.

20:54.919 --> 20:56.621
When he comes
and competes with you,

20:56.888 --> 21:00.625
this tea house right here may well
return to its rightful owners.

21:01.092 --> 21:02.093
I'll be ready for him.

21:02.793 --> 21:03.695
Hmm.

21:07.097 --> 21:08.632
[indistinct chatter]

21:09.600 --> 21:10.635
Where are you from?

21:11.835 --> 21:15.239
Uh... I worked at Union Bank
in Jiangxi, then the Japs came.

21:15.739 --> 21:16.775
What's in the bag?

21:17.909 --> 21:18.810
Is it money?

21:19.043 --> 21:21.012
I wish. No, documents.

21:21.645 --> 21:23.047
I have to keep them right here.

21:24.248 --> 21:26.549
What for?

21:26.551 --> 21:29.721
It's sensitive customer information.
Numbers, statements. That kinda stuff.

21:30.688 --> 21:31.954
Has to be private.

21:31.956 --> 21:32.858
Why is that?

21:33.891 --> 21:35.227
Honor. [chuckles]

21:38.763 --> 21:41.066
[airplane roaring]

21:42.900 --> 21:45.136
Take cover over there!
Take the kids!

21:49.140 --> 21:50.973
- Go.
- Where?

21:50.975 --> 21:52.611
- Get in the truck, now!
- Oh, no, my pigs.

21:53.276 --> 21:54.243
[Chun] My pigs.

21:54.245 --> 21:56.344
[pigs squealing]

21:56.346 --> 21:57.516
Hey.

22:00.617 --> 22:02.286
Come on, you fascists!

22:03.153 --> 22:07.659
I'm right here! Fascist clowns!
Come on!

22:08.892 --> 22:10.862
Got it. Got your pig.

22:13.698 --> 22:15.033
Argh!

22:16.167 --> 22:18.203
- Cui!
- No!

22:18.869 --> 22:19.771
Cui!

22:21.271 --> 22:22.670
[panting]

22:22.672 --> 22:23.642
Cui.

22:24.107 --> 22:24.975
Cui.

22:26.142 --> 22:27.546
[gasping]

22:29.346 --> 22:30.781
I won't make it home.

22:36.621 --> 22:37.322
Give this...

22:38.623 --> 22:40.659
to my father for the contest.

22:41.792 --> 22:42.694
Let him...

22:43.527 --> 22:46.730
win for once
as a mahjong champion.

22:50.968 --> 22:52.938
The truck is carrying...

22:53.970 --> 22:54.940
[gasps]

23:06.417 --> 23:09.384
[in Japanese]

23:09.386 --> 23:10.852
[screaming]

23:10.854 --> 23:12.891
[siren blaring]

23:44.755 --> 23:45.757
Wait, wait.

23:46.824 --> 23:47.726
Step back.

23:50.795 --> 23:53.098
Here, give the hose to me.
I got it.

23:53.930 --> 23:55.700
No, careful.

23:55.900 --> 23:57.369
[grunting]

23:58.134 --> 23:59.738
[man] These flames
just won't go out.

24:02.440 --> 24:05.643
All right. Someone help them put
this fire out. Faster, faster.

24:09.947 --> 24:11.382
[Gangtou] I'm not really
with the army.

24:14.351 --> 24:15.253
Ah...

24:16.219 --> 24:17.389
I'm with the air force.

24:18.122 --> 24:20.659
I love the air force.
So dignified.

24:20.990 --> 24:22.227
[scoffs] What nonsense.

24:23.728 --> 24:26.698
We go up there to die.
I'm not afraid of the Japs,

24:27.064 --> 24:28.999
but their planes are more
advanced.

24:29.467 --> 24:31.402
It's a bloodbath up there.

24:32.068 --> 24:34.305
Try to get in there first
or they'll shoot you down.

24:35.472 --> 24:37.207
Thank you, hero.

24:37.440 --> 24:40.245
I'm not a hero.
Not as long as I'm alive.

24:40.978 --> 24:43.248
In the last few battles,
everyone in our squadron died.

24:44.448 --> 24:45.450
Except for me.

24:46.417 --> 24:47.786
They were the real heroes.

24:48.184 --> 24:50.020
I'm the one loser
who got through.

24:51.055 --> 24:52.222
[tires screeching]

25:00.765 --> 25:04.936
Go. Take the kids. Get away, take the kids.
Get away from here.

25:07.938 --> 25:11.910
Stay away. It's a bomb from a
Japanese plane. Didn't blow.

25:15.045 --> 25:17.348
I can try and disable it.

25:17.782 --> 25:20.151
- Please don't risk it if you're not certain.
- What else can we do?

25:21.485 --> 25:23.384
The road's narrow.
Truck won't fit.

25:23.386 --> 25:25.155
[Mei] You shouldn't risk
it if you're not sure.

25:25.523 --> 25:26.424
[engine revving]

25:35.332 --> 25:37.102
[grunts] What are you doing?

26:14.505 --> 26:16.775
[indistinct chatter]

26:21.277 --> 26:22.247
Why are you here?

26:24.949 --> 26:27.218
We ask for your permission
to join the battle, sir.

26:27.884 --> 26:29.317
No way.

26:29.319 --> 26:31.355
The Japanese airplanes
are humiliating us.

26:32.055 --> 26:34.191
How can you sit here
and play mahjong?

26:35.191 --> 26:36.426
Mahjong is no kids' stuff.

26:37.061 --> 26:38.994
It's mimic warfare.

26:38.996 --> 26:41.229
Could be helpful with your critical
thinking, especially yours.

26:41.231 --> 26:46.133
Sir, people in the city and even the whole
country are calling us helpless cowards.

26:46.135 --> 26:47.571
We cannot bear this anymore.

26:48.138 --> 26:50.471
Please give us permission
to fight.

26:50.473 --> 26:54.508
A truly brave person does not demonstrate his
bravery by hastening his death for nothing.

26:54.510 --> 26:58.282
And if he has to die,
he has to die a martyr's death.

26:58.615 --> 27:01.249
But your air force is not
well-trained or equipped at all.

27:01.251 --> 27:04.188
Even then, it's better than
sitting here playing mahjong.

27:08.092 --> 27:11.094
Ha! Yes! Big three
dragons, red dragon.

27:12.896 --> 27:15.599
That was quite a trick back there.
If you were Japanese,

27:16.533 --> 27:17.632
you'd tell me, right?

27:17.634 --> 27:18.969
[chuckles]

27:20.136 --> 27:22.206
You're a joker. You don't
like me, but that's okay.

27:22.972 --> 27:26.143
And I don't like you either. But
we do have a common interest.

27:26.677 --> 27:27.879
And what's that?

27:28.312 --> 27:29.247
The truck.

27:30.314 --> 27:33.951
I need a ride, and you
can't drive right now.

27:36.152 --> 27:38.021
[scoffs] At least
you know your place.

27:48.465 --> 27:51.035
Argh! Son of a bitch!

27:54.604 --> 27:56.641
[clamoring]

28:09.652 --> 28:11.922
Which bastard's
flying that plane?

28:12.221 --> 28:13.624
That is fucked up!

28:22.632 --> 28:23.534
[whistling]

28:58.568 --> 29:01.638
Shoot that son of a bitch through
the head and come back here.

29:02.171 --> 29:03.074
Roger that.

29:26.796 --> 29:28.165

29:35.671 --> 29:38.508
An Minxun, hurry up
and return back to base.

29:38.776 --> 29:41.442
Why?

29:41.444 --> 29:43.246
[Jack] <i>There are multiple bogeys
coming your way. We're being ambushed.</i>

he's right here.

30:23.120 --> 30:24.486
- I need to come through.
- [man] Hey! He's Jap!

30:24.488 --> 30:26.521
- It's a Jap!
- He's a Jap! Kill him!

30:26.523 --> 30:27.525
Stop!

30:29.226 --> 30:30.194
He's one of us.

30:31.094 --> 30:32.229
Stop the truck!

30:34.631 --> 30:35.565
Move!

30:38.267 --> 30:39.170
Minxun.

30:40.036 --> 30:42.239
He's Chinese.
You almost killed him!

30:42.639 --> 30:44.642
Cut him loose. I'll take him.

- Quick, children, under the table.

Get up. Come on.

32:37.921 --> 32:39.420
We must lay him down.

32:39.422 --> 32:40.357
Go.

32:41.491 --> 32:43.827
- Outside. Now. Go on.
- Come on, kids. Stay together.

32:46.296 --> 32:48.365
[grunting]

32:50.866 --> 32:51.835
Okay. Easy.

32:52.401 --> 32:53.537
We have to operate here.

32:54.238 --> 32:55.206
We don't have much time.

32:55.639 --> 32:57.272
How can we operate here?

32:57.274 --> 32:59.677
If we don't take the bullet out,
he's gonna die.

32:59.875 --> 33:00.944

33:02.278 --> 33:05.313
Be strong. Here, take this.
Take it.

33:05.315 --> 33:06.249
But for what?

33:06.682 --> 33:07.584
Just take it!

33:09.987 --> 33:11.622
- Stay strong.
- Sterilize it.

Tell me what to do
and I'll do it.

Feel around for the bullet,
and pull it out.

33:51.460 --> 33:52.363
[Gangtou] Found it.

33:56.365 --> 33:57.535
We'll have to give him stitches.

33:58.669 --> 33:59.603
But how?

34:05.308 --> 34:07.342
Nice work, Mei.

34:07.344 --> 34:10.344
My mom's a seamstress. I've been
sewing buttons on since I was a child.

34:10.346 --> 34:11.915
Look, friend. I got it out.

34:12.683 --> 34:13.751
Thank you.

34:15.085 --> 34:18.053
Are you trying to kill him? You
don't know what you're doing.

34:18.054 --> 34:19.956
Hey, watch it.
Who are you talking to?

34:20.723 --> 34:22.525
You forgot a detail,
like hygiene.

34:25.360 --> 34:26.429
You can help me.

34:28.732 --> 34:29.667
Let's clean it.

34:39.576 --> 34:42.313
Hey. Hello, guys.

34:44.114 --> 34:45.016
Yeah.

34:45.882 --> 34:47.717
There are enough of you
to form a squad.

34:48.685 --> 34:50.920
Who here wants to be
a squad leader, huh?

35:12.609 --> 35:13.777
Still doesn't work.

35:20.783 --> 35:22.585

35:22.852 --> 35:23.820

35:26.422 --> 35:27.390
I'm leaving.

35:28.924 --> 35:29.859
Minxun.

35:30.926 --> 35:33.096
Minxun, you can't leave,
brother.

If we have to die,
then we die up there,

35:43.006 --> 35:44.341
not down here.

35:45.875 --> 35:47.011
I'm sorry.

35:48.078 --> 35:49.013

35:51.448 --> 35:54.484
Don't worry. I know what
you did for my brother.

Let me finish
what you both started.

I studied medicine.

36:12.669 --> 36:14.502
But now, I'm a journalist.

36:14.504 --> 36:16.406
I want the world to know what
really happened in Chongqing.

36:23.513 --> 36:25.549
[indistinct chatter]

37:16.899 --> 37:19.536

Time to cross the river.

38:01.245 --> 38:03.710
You're not out of the woods yet. We'll go to
the hospital when we reach the other side.

38:03.712 --> 38:04.714
No need.

38:05.681 --> 38:07.917
So many in our squadron...

38:09.585 --> 38:10.921
they died for our country.

38:12.187 --> 38:13.888
I have to return
to the battlefield.

38:13.890 --> 38:14.959
You must be afraid.

38:16.859 --> 38:17.794
I'm not.

38:19.596 --> 38:21.165
I just don't want any regrets.

38:22.131 --> 38:23.666
I understand how you feel.

38:26.335 --> 38:28.939
Just let me know
if you need my help.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.002
I'm sorry.

front. There are four million of us.</i>

we will raise 4 million yuan.</i>

39:44.247 --> 39:49.083
<i>We can use the money to buy planes
and artillery to fight those Japs!</i>

39:49.085 --> 39:50.853

is our last stand.

There's nowhere left
to retreat to.

39:53.355 --> 39:56.757
It will take every one of us to stand
up and fight the Japanese invaders

39:56.759 --> 39:59.196
and showing everyone
that we will never give up!

39:59.696 --> 40:03.232
The Japanese have dropped thousands
of tons of bombs on this city.

40:03.832 --> 40:07.868
What they don't know is that this
Chinese heart in here will never stop!

40:07.870 --> 40:11.674
[all shouting] Never!
Never! Never! Never!

40:11.875 --> 40:14.011
[in Japanese]

40:20.216 --> 40:22.252
[screaming]

40:28.892 --> 40:31.227
[screaming]

40:40.035 --> 40:42.338
Coming through. Make way.
Let us through.

40:43.138 --> 40:44.207
Hurry up, hurry up.

40:45.375 --> 40:46.710
Help me, help me.

40:51.247 --> 40:54.817
I can't stop the bleeding.
We tried different compresses.

40:56.018 --> 40:58.486
He's hemorrhaging badly. He's
stopped breathing. Hurry, please.

40:58.488 --> 40:59.857
Julia?

41:00.957 --> 41:03.393
I thought you got on the boat.
Why are you still here?

41:03.792 --> 41:05.292
The boat was hit
before it even docked.

41:05.294 --> 41:07.328
I came back with a team
transporting the wounded.

41:07.330 --> 41:10.299
You are the expert
brought here by our government.

41:10.500 --> 41:13.303
Since you're still here,
we could really use your help.

41:17.073 --> 41:18.942
The boat sails to England
twice a month.

41:19.241 --> 41:21.879
So you'll have my international
assistance for the next two weeks.

41:22.145 --> 41:23.944
Thanks a lot.
Let's get to work.

41:23.946 --> 41:24.879
Hmm.

41:24.881 --> 41:26.216
[indistinct chatter]

41:34.790 --> 41:35.758
Hey.

41:38.794 --> 41:41.230
You want some water?
Some water? Something?

41:42.031 --> 41:44.234
[man] The last boat out of here
leaves tomorrow, Steve.

41:45.067 --> 41:46.134
I want you on it.

41:46.136 --> 41:47.868
I can't leave these people.

41:47.870 --> 41:50.239
After this,
I can't guarantee safe passage.

41:54.243 --> 41:55.812
Someone told me something.

41:56.812 --> 41:57.881
Stuck with me.

42:00.183 --> 42:02.853
If you're not willing to fight
for what you love...

42:05.388 --> 42:07.458
then you never deserved it
in the first place.

42:14.497 --> 42:15.998
May God be with you.

42:18.334 --> 42:19.502
Take care, Steve.

42:23.205 --> 42:24.806
[indistinct chatter]

42:24.808 --> 42:26.207
Excuse me, I'm looking
for an Uncle Cui.

42:26.209 --> 42:28.241
Yeah. That's me. [laughs]

42:28.243 --> 42:32.181
Gangtou gave me, um,
a couple of things to give you.

42:32.515 --> 42:34.017
There's a letter, and this.

42:34.216 --> 42:35.118
- Here you are.
- Oh.

42:36.352 --> 42:38.386
Gangtou? Where is he?

42:38.388 --> 42:40.357
On the north side. The bridges are down.
He's stuck there.

42:41.089 --> 42:42.890
Can you get her
a cup of tea?

42:42.892 --> 42:44.460
Not for me. I must get going.
But thank you.

42:46.361 --> 42:49.298
Thank you. Thank you. [laughs]

42:50.533 --> 42:52.966
Young Gangtou
is such a good boy.

42:52.968 --> 42:54.601
It's so nice of him
to think of me.

42:54.603 --> 42:56.270
- Yeah.
- Would you tell me what it says, please?

42:56.272 --> 42:57.341
Yeah. Yeah.

42:59.609 --> 43:00.511
Uncle...

43:01.243 --> 43:02.245
Something wrong?

43:04.247 --> 43:05.515
Your boy is gone.

43:28.904 --> 43:31.941
Lucky, I have
nothing to live for now.

43:33.509 --> 43:35.411
I'm too sad to take care of you.

43:36.312 --> 43:37.247
I'm sorry.

43:38.982 --> 43:40.150
You deserve better.

43:41.451 --> 43:42.386
Go now.

43:44.486 --> 43:46.455
Find someone
with a reason to live.

43:56.598 --> 43:58.301
[crying]

44:11.513 --> 44:13.115
[laughs] Here you go.

44:13.515 --> 44:14.249
Thanks.

44:14.984 --> 44:16.917
I taught him
everything he knows.

44:16.919 --> 44:18.551
But I got to ask you,

44:18.553 --> 44:22.089
what's a beautiful girl like you
doing with this guy? [laughs]

44:22.091 --> 44:23.658
[all laughing]

44:23.660 --> 44:25.592
Hey, Minxun, my good friend,

44:25.594 --> 44:28.295
you don't mind if I show your
pretty lady friend around the base?

44:28.297 --> 44:30.130
- [chattering]
- Yeah, he's good.

44:30.132 --> 44:31.332
That's good.

44:31.334 --> 44:32.533
Hey, come on...

44:32.535 --> 44:33.469
Sir!

44:34.603 --> 44:36.306
Sir.

44:38.006 --> 44:40.877
You aren't concerned about us exploiting
your first date with this beautiful woman?

44:41.176 --> 44:42.078
Uh...

44:42.312 --> 44:43.346
We're not dating.

44:44.580 --> 44:47.517
I order you to escort this
young woman around the base.

44:48.183 --> 44:49.185
That's an order.

44:50.419 --> 44:51.454
[laughing]

44:55.524 --> 44:58.327
[Susan] These photos are more full
of life than any I've ever taken.

45:04.366 --> 45:05.368
Mmm-mmm.

45:06.035 --> 45:06.904
[laughs]

45:10.372 --> 45:11.274
It's ready.

45:14.477 --> 45:15.379
Wow.

45:15.745 --> 45:16.947
Gorgeous.

46:06.495 --> 46:07.396
Here you are.

46:08.564 --> 46:09.565
For keepsake.

46:15.138 --> 46:16.973
You keep one for yourself.

46:20.109 --> 46:21.011
I'm leaving.

46:22.444 --> 46:23.479
Tomorrow morning.

46:26.281 --> 46:27.450
[sighs]

46:29.085 --> 46:30.754
[explosions]

46:39.361 --> 46:40.696
Just make sure
you stay alive.

46:42.397 --> 46:43.566
Yeah, you, too.

46:44.500 --> 46:46.103
I forbid you to die.

47:00.817 --> 47:02.285
Be careful with my piggies!

47:02.852 --> 47:05.118
Look here. I'll teach you.

47:05.120 --> 47:08.154
From here to here
to the target,

47:08.156 --> 47:09.658
line up the dots
and you can't miss.

47:10.792 --> 47:12.428
- But be careful...
- [gunshot]

47:16.832 --> 47:18.535
What is going on?
Are you out of your mind?

47:18.835 --> 47:20.537
Why are you teaching them
about guns?

47:21.404 --> 47:23.804
You're worse than gunpowder.
Always exploding.

47:23.806 --> 47:25.609
Well, if that's the case,
you shouldn't provoke me.

47:26.475 --> 47:27.510
You're just a big bully.

47:28.678 --> 47:29.578
Let's go.

47:33.482 --> 47:34.517
What do you think of her?

47:35.283 --> 47:36.252
Flawless.

47:36.451 --> 47:37.421
Perfect.

47:44.227 --> 47:45.127
Easy.

47:47.395 --> 47:49.330
From the first time
I've seen this fighter plane,

47:49.332 --> 47:50.734
I've never been afraid to die.

47:51.634 --> 47:53.770
I'll always find
the right reason to fight.

47:56.172 --> 47:57.274
What do you mean, sir?

47:57.573 --> 47:59.709
You and An Minxun
have that experience.

48:00.810 --> 48:03.313
But only one person
could pilot the P-40.

48:20.263 --> 48:22.265
There's only one man
who can fly the P-40.

48:23.399 --> 48:24.468
That's me!

48:34.310 --> 48:35.779
Hey! Minxun!

48:37.279 --> 48:38.747
You come back here right now!

48:42.218 --> 48:43.185
Are you deaf?

48:43.685 --> 48:44.587
Get off.

48:44.953 --> 48:46.522
[grunting]

48:50.660 --> 48:52.761
That P-40 is mine!
You get that?

49:07.442 --> 49:08.344
Get up!

49:30.832 --> 49:32.168
[grunting]

49:40.576 --> 49:41.578
Argh!

49:55.457 --> 49:58.327
Give me the P-40,
please.

49:59.728 --> 50:01.330
Please let me seek revenge.

50:03.632 --> 50:05.401
Take the damn P-40.

50:06.868 --> 50:08.771
But you're not the only one
seeking revenge.

50:23.051 --> 50:25.888
The winner of today's contest
will donate his winnings

50:26.422 --> 50:28.257
to help our forces
fight the Japs.

50:28.524 --> 50:31.025
So, with pleasure,
I hereby start the contest.

50:31.027 --> 50:33.396
[cheering]

50:34.430 --> 50:36.730
Our Uncle Cui's son
died for our country.

50:36.732 --> 50:40.033
So we're pleased to announce
Cui will play instead!

50:40.035 --> 50:43.036
[cheering]

50:43.038 --> 50:44.904
Sit down. Yeah. Come on.

50:44.906 --> 50:46.640

50:51.413 --> 50:52.415
Make it strong.

50:54.850 --> 50:55.951
Put in lots of nails.

50:56.953 --> 50:58.922
- How's it going?
- Take the kids across, okay?

51:00.056 --> 51:00.987
Be careful.

51:00.989 --> 51:02.489
Oh, okay. Sure.

51:02.491 --> 51:03.460
Come on.

51:43.631 --> 51:44.733
It's an air raid!

51:45.000 --> 51:46.870
Come on! Run!

51:49.038 --> 51:50.036
Drive across.

It's an honor to be here
with you men tonight.

52:53.435 --> 52:54.903
I appreciate this little party.

52:56.471 --> 52:57.870
This may be my last birthday.

52:57.872 --> 52:59.041
Just a moment, sir.

53:18.627 --> 53:19.529
Sir...

53:20.029 --> 53:21.498
please keep our presents.

53:21.864 --> 53:25.602
From now on, we want you
to stay on the ground

53:25.935 --> 53:26.803
and command us.

53:27.569 --> 53:28.504
For our sakes,

53:29.238 --> 53:30.707
you have to stay alive.

53:36.212 --> 53:37.514
Thank you very much.

53:41.484 --> 53:44.453
I know what this gift represents
and what it means,

53:44.652 --> 53:45.888
and this is also my war.

53:46.754 --> 53:48.524
It's been an honor
serving with you.

53:54.062 --> 53:56.732
My father was a soldier as well.

53:57.165 --> 53:58.468
This is his watch.

54:00.902 --> 54:03.640
He said that if anything ever
happened to him, he should...

54:05.140 --> 54:06.776
give it to his son, and he did.

54:07.609 --> 54:08.644
This is his watch.

54:10.245 --> 54:11.879
Let's set some rules.

54:11.881 --> 54:13.516
No matter
what happens tomorrow,

54:14.917 --> 54:18.121
the last person standing will be
the one to receive these presents.

54:19.654 --> 54:20.823
Let's have some cake

54:22.223 --> 54:23.859

Yaogu!

01:03:20.629 --> 01:03:22.264
Hurry. Hurry up.

01:03:23.464 --> 01:03:24.366
[Uncle Cui] Come on.

01:03:24.799 --> 01:03:26.234
- Uncle Cui!
- Manguan.

01:03:26.701 --> 01:03:28.435
- Give me the baby.
- Cui. Thank you.

01:03:28.437 --> 01:03:30.639
[shouting and crying]

01:03:35.343 --> 01:03:38.243
Yaogu! I need you to
wake up. Please wake up.

01:03:38.245 --> 01:03:39.645
You're a very tough boy,
Lang Tu.

01:03:39.647 --> 01:03:41.281
- Water! Who has water?
- You'll beat this.

01:03:41.283 --> 01:03:42.681
Thank you so much.

01:03:42.683 --> 01:03:45.085
[Uncle Cui] Come on now,
Lang Tu. You can do it.

01:03:45.087 --> 01:03:46.222
Drink some of this.

01:03:47.122 --> 01:03:49.154
What can I do? What can I do?

01:03:49.156 --> 01:03:50.225
Go on. Spit it!

01:03:50.725 --> 01:03:52.560
- Huh?
- Spit. Right on her face.

01:03:57.631 --> 01:03:58.730
[coughs]

01:03:58.732 --> 01:04:00.669
Yaogu. Yaogu!

01:04:01.435 --> 01:04:03.538
My love. You're alive!

01:04:04.506 --> 01:04:06.509
- That's my Yaogu!
- Lang Tu! Lang Tu!

01:04:07.274 --> 01:04:08.710
- [crying]
- Lang Tu is awake!

01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:10.779
[Cui laughing]

01:04:22.290 --> 01:04:23.192
Come on.

01:04:50.886 --> 01:04:53.122
[indistinct chatter]

01:05:01.495 --> 01:05:02.797
Here. Take this.

01:05:03.631 --> 01:05:04.834
I have business to attend to.

01:05:05.332 --> 01:05:06.234
I'll see you later.

01:05:13.308 --> 01:05:14.310
[children crying]

01:05:14.542 --> 01:05:15.611
Don't leave.

01:05:22.817 --> 01:05:24.786
Don't cry now, my love.

01:05:25.219 --> 01:05:26.618
It's all right. Come on.

01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:27.819
- Come on. Come with me.
- No need to cry.

01:05:27.821 --> 01:05:29.357
- We'll try.
- We'll try.

01:05:29.658 --> 01:05:31.426
We'll see Papa. Come on.

01:05:35.596 --> 01:05:36.862
I'm gonna take care of you.

01:05:36.864 --> 01:05:37.665
- Come.
- You'll be fine.

01:05:39.868 --> 01:05:42.304
Hey, can you tell me
what this says?

01:05:44.739 --> 01:05:47.576
Mm, I can speak English, but I'm
not very good at reading it.

01:05:47.808 --> 01:05:50.145
But Ding's pretty smart.
Hey, Ding.

01:05:50.544 --> 01:05:51.747
Can you take a look at this?

01:05:55.683 --> 01:05:57.750
- It's written by someone who has...
- No!

01:05:57.752 --> 01:05:59.484
No need to analyze it.

01:05:59.486 --> 01:06:00.655
- [laughs]
- Just tell me.

01:06:02.089 --> 01:06:05.727
They want you to deliver this note
to a Miss Susan at <i>Xinhua Daily.</i>

01:06:06.361 --> 01:06:08.430
The silver coin
is for your troubles.

01:06:09.598 --> 01:06:11.534
What silver coin?
There's nothing in here.

01:06:12.533 --> 01:06:13.935
Come on.

01:06:14.402 --> 01:06:16.536
Since you've obviously already
availed yourself of the money,

01:06:16.538 --> 01:06:18.207
you should deliver this note.

01:06:18.473 --> 01:06:20.672
I'm telling you,
someone's taken it.

01:06:20.674 --> 01:06:22.911
Looks like that someone was you,
my friend.

01:06:23.477 --> 01:06:25.313
No, you put a silver coin.

01:06:25.513 --> 01:06:27.846
No, that means
you'd make twice the money.

01:06:27.848 --> 01:06:29.751
If you took the coin,
just deliver it.

01:06:31.285 --> 01:06:32.554
Someone else can do it.
I'm not.

01:06:32.988 --> 01:06:35.823
Ah. It's a question
of honor, huh?

01:06:36.357 --> 01:06:37.325
[sighs]

01:06:44.565 --> 01:06:45.667
You called for me?

01:06:46.901 --> 01:06:49.638
This P-40,
it belongs to you.

01:06:50.538 --> 01:06:51.574
I'm not following.

01:06:53.575 --> 01:06:54.643
You're a better pilot.

01:07:11.593 --> 01:07:13.696
[chuckles] As of today,

01:07:14.895 --> 01:07:16.231
I'll be your wingman.

01:07:31.446 --> 01:07:32.648
Excuse me, miss?

01:07:32.913 --> 01:07:34.580
Hey! I know you.

01:07:34.582 --> 01:07:36.683
Likewise, sir.
So what brings you here?

01:07:36.685 --> 01:07:38.687
I'm looking for Miss Susan.

01:07:38.919 --> 01:07:39.854
I'm Miss Susan.

01:07:40.821 --> 01:07:42.690
I didn't take the money
that was in there.

01:07:44.692 --> 01:07:45.593
For me?

01:07:48.629 --> 01:07:49.530
Just a letter.

01:08:02.343 --> 01:08:03.811
Thank you, Uncle Cui.

01:08:04.879 --> 01:08:06.679
That message
must be worth something.

01:08:06.681 --> 01:08:07.650
He wants to marry me.

01:08:10.718 --> 01:08:11.919
Buy yourself a wedding gift.

01:08:16.491 --> 01:08:18.527
[in Japanese]

01:08:53.627 --> 01:08:54.929
This is the final stretch.

01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:57.399
Japan has her best men forward.

01:08:57.799 --> 01:09:00.866
All of our best men are gone.
But we're still here.

01:09:00.868 --> 01:09:03.835
The Japanese are getting their
biggest bombers ready, so we,

01:09:03.837 --> 01:09:06.474
as a reserve team, are gonna
fight those sons of bitches.

01:09:06.974 --> 01:09:08.910
Most importantly,
we're still standing here.

01:09:09.176 --> 01:09:11.009
We have not died.

01:09:11.011 --> 01:09:13.645
We need the world to remember
this is Chongqing's sky.

01:09:13.648 --> 01:09:15.781
Light up those burning fires
in yourself

01:09:15.783 --> 01:09:18.116
and use all the bullets
to puncture the armor.

01:09:18.118 --> 01:09:20.089
Let's welcome
a bloody fight to the end.

01:09:20.587 --> 01:09:21.956
[all] Swift as thunder!

01:09:22.157 --> 01:09:24.893
[siren blaring]

01:09:29.531 --> 01:09:31.567
[in Japanese]

01:09:47.549 --> 01:09:48.649
Argh!

01:10:07.868 --> 01:10:08.937
Charlie, where are you?

01:10:09.136 --> 01:10:10.906
Can't see. Your two
o'clock, I think.

01:10:20.648 --> 01:10:21.817
[yelling]

01:10:29.991 --> 01:10:31.693
[yelling]

01:10:35.162 --> 01:10:36.829
[yelling]

01:10:36.831 --> 01:10:38.801
[shouting]

01:10:48.643 --> 01:10:50.511
[yelling]

01:11:00.889 --> 01:11:04.626
[crowd chanting]

01:11:06.995 --> 01:11:09.497
- [man 1] It's a Chinese plane.
- [man 2] Get him out of here!

01:11:10.665 --> 01:11:12.568
[crowd chanting]

01:11:34.688 --> 01:11:37.526
[grunting]

01:11:41.895 --> 01:11:43.031
So I wasn't wrong.

01:11:43.864 --> 01:11:44.800
Why are you here?

01:11:45.099 --> 01:11:46.031
To finish up.

01:11:46.033 --> 01:11:47.502
With what?

01:11:48.937 --> 01:11:51.102
You've been protecting the British
decoder on this entire journey.

01:11:51.104 --> 01:11:52.139
You think I didn't know?

01:11:53.206 --> 01:11:55.274
You risked being killed
by your own planes for that?

01:11:55.276 --> 01:11:58.013
There are only two outcomes of war.
Life or death.

01:11:58.712 --> 01:12:01.880
Taking the decoder from you or blowing
it up have different consequences.

01:12:01.882 --> 01:12:03.783
I choose to take it with me.

01:12:03.785 --> 01:12:04.950
You son of a...

01:12:04.952 --> 01:12:06.754
[grunting]

01:12:09.857 --> 01:12:13.528
Once I pull this safety ring, the
truck will be blown sky-high.

01:12:17.031 --> 01:12:18.267
And the decoder with it.

01:12:19.067 --> 01:12:20.903
It's gonna be brilliant.

01:12:22.103 --> 01:12:24.038
[grunting]

01:12:29.277 --> 01:12:30.645
[screaming]

01:13:08.782 --> 01:13:09.984
[Mei] What's that
under the truck?

01:13:11.452 --> 01:13:13.854
[Gangtou] Gotta get the truck away
from all that gasoline back there.

01:13:16.791 --> 01:13:18.423
Get out of here.
It might blow.

01:13:18.425 --> 01:13:19.627
I'm staying with you.

01:13:22.295 --> 01:13:24.332
[in Japanese]

01:13:33.206 --> 01:13:35.343
[screaming]

01:13:58.166 --> 01:14:00.031
It's gonna blow.
Get out of here.

01:14:00.033 --> 01:14:01.836
Here. Scissors.

01:14:10.278 --> 01:14:12.244
The one on the right.
I've just got a hunch.

01:14:12.246 --> 01:14:13.248
Do it.

01:14:23.424 --> 01:14:25.260
[panting]

01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:30.332
[coughs]

01:14:37.138 --> 01:14:38.040
Gangtou?

01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:40.242
Gangtou?

01:14:41.274 --> 01:14:42.176
Gangtou!

01:14:46.747 --> 01:14:48.849
What are you doing?
You've got to wake up!

01:14:49.517 --> 01:14:51.049
We've come so far.

01:14:51.051 --> 01:14:52.987
You're not going to
leave me by myself now.

01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:56.924
Don't die, don't die,
don't die!

01:14:58.059 --> 01:15:01.129
[sobbing] Why did I tell you
to cut the wire?

01:15:06.134 --> 01:15:08.303
You never should have
listened to me.

01:15:09.903 --> 01:15:11.436
Wake up. Wake up!

01:15:11.438 --> 01:15:12.339
Don't you know...

01:15:15.843 --> 01:15:18.380
you should never slap a man?

01:15:20.247 --> 01:15:21.482
You were right, you know.

01:15:22.817 --> 01:15:23.885
It didn't blow.

01:15:25.952 --> 01:15:27.221
It was another bomb.

01:15:33.827 --> 01:15:34.795
Be my wife.

01:15:36.296 --> 01:15:39.734
I probably don't deserve you,
but I'll make you happy.

01:15:42.937 --> 01:15:44.973
[in Japanese]

01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:49.044
[shouting]

01:15:50.577 --> 01:15:54.148
Come on! Go ahead
and shoot my Chongqing heart.

01:16:29.483 --> 01:16:32.053
[yelling]

01:17:08.656 --> 01:17:10.158
You're not getting out of this.

01:17:18.666 --> 01:17:19.901
[yelling]

01:17:31.312 --> 01:17:32.277
Tao Lei!

01:17:32.279 --> 01:17:34.381
[engine sputtering]

01:17:36.117 --> 01:17:37.419
I tried...

01:17:56.170 --> 01:17:57.973
Argh!

01:18:06.447 --> 01:18:08.450
[yelling]

01:18:09.215 --> 01:18:10.919
[yelling]

01:18:36.711 --> 01:18:37.612
Where are you going?

01:18:38.211 --> 01:18:39.147
Don't worry.

01:18:49.456 --> 01:18:51.125
Fuel tank's empty.

01:18:53.327 --> 01:18:55.363
Request emergency landing.

01:18:58.631 --> 01:19:00.201
Air speed, 25.

01:19:00.568 --> 01:19:02.237
Height, 85 meters.

01:19:29.596 --> 01:19:30.564
Come on.

01:19:31.098 --> 01:19:32.167
Come on!

01:19:42.242 --> 01:19:44.312
Down! Come on!

01:19:52.385 --> 01:19:54.421
Yeah. Come on. Line it up!

01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:00.328
Come on!

01:20:07.268 --> 01:20:08.403
[grunts]

01:20:36.529 --> 01:20:37.431
Come on!

01:20:38.631 --> 01:20:39.634
Come on!

01:21:00.321 --> 01:21:01.488
Whoo!

01:21:12.198 --> 01:21:13.100
[grunts]

01:21:17.705 --> 01:21:18.739
Ah!

01:21:30.483 --> 01:21:33.854
[tires screeching]

01:21:43.163 --> 01:21:44.465
[gasps]

01:21:47.268 --> 01:21:48.536
[Jack] Yeah!

01:21:48.801 --> 01:21:50.471
Yeah, Xue!

01:22:03.483 --> 01:22:05.319
Propping up. Unbelievable.

01:22:08.822 --> 01:22:12.127
Most admirable trainee.
Fantastic!

01:22:12.893 --> 01:22:14.660
Sir.

01:22:14.662 --> 01:22:16.661
Air Force Captain Gangtou Xue
reporting for duty.

01:22:16.663 --> 01:22:20.602
Unbelievable. Unbelievable landing.
Are you all right?

01:22:21.402 --> 01:22:22.370
[grunts]

01:22:39.553 --> 01:22:40.622
It was a tough mission.

01:22:41.388 --> 01:22:43.190
Chongqing's safer,
thanks to you.

01:22:43.823 --> 01:22:45.492
You'll be decorated.
I'll see to it.

01:22:47.894 --> 01:22:51.299
Sir, it should go to the driver who took
the mission. He really deserves it.

01:22:51.532 --> 01:22:52.700
His name is Sergeant Cui.

01:22:52.933 --> 01:22:54.569
He died for our country
on the journey.

01:22:54.768 --> 01:22:55.937
He gave me the mission,

01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:57.605
right after he was shot.

01:22:57.804 --> 01:22:59.905
Did he explain to you
what it was?

01:22:59.907 --> 01:23:00.875
No, he didn't, sir.

01:23:01.474 --> 01:23:02.643
He just said to deliver it.

01:23:03.243 --> 01:23:03.976
That's all he said.

01:23:03.978 --> 01:23:05.580
Good work.

01:23:07.014 --> 01:23:09.914
[man] It's the night of the mahjong
final and Gangtou Xue's wedding!

01:23:09.916 --> 01:23:13.321
Nice to see you.
Hello. Come in. Welcome.

01:23:14.321 --> 01:23:16.291
Hello, everyone. Come on in.

01:23:17.724 --> 01:23:19.660
I should go
to be with the guests.

01:23:19.859 --> 01:23:21.696
Gangtou! Come here.

01:23:22.630 --> 01:23:23.565
Three characters.

01:23:23.930 --> 01:23:25.299
Nice tile.

01:23:25.565 --> 01:23:26.466
There we are.

01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:31.371
South wind.

01:23:49.657 --> 01:23:51.960
Come on. It's mahjong,
not mind-reading.

01:23:55.962 --> 01:23:57.428
There.

01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:58.996
- A nine! [laughing]
- [cheering]

01:23:58.998 --> 01:24:00.434
I've won!

01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:04.505
Nine characters.
You see that? Wow!

01:24:05.973 --> 01:24:07.408
[Uncle Cui] This one's for you.

01:24:07.675 --> 01:24:10.812
My son!

01:24:15.715 --> 01:24:16.682
Honey?

01:24:16.684 --> 01:24:17.652
Honey?

01:24:17.850 --> 01:24:18.786
- Huh?
- It's falling.

01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:21.688
[Mei shrieks]

01:24:23.389 --> 01:24:24.123
[man] There's a bomb!

01:24:24.925 --> 01:24:26.427

- [shouting]

01:24:32.733 --> 01:24:33.968
Uncle Cui!

01:24:36.370 --> 01:24:37.468
Let me help you.

01:24:37.470 --> 01:24:38.602
[straining] No. It could blow.

01:24:38.604 --> 01:24:40.672
- Let me...
- Be careful.

01:24:40.674 --> 01:24:41.876
Easy, Uncle Cui.

01:24:42.943 --> 01:24:44.910
- Here, use this chair.
- Okay.

01:24:44.912 --> 01:24:46.712
- Be careful.
- Go easy now, Cui.

01:24:46.714 --> 01:24:47.982
- Hmm.
- Make sure you're steady.

01:24:52.618 --> 01:24:53.787
I got you.

01:24:54.487 --> 01:24:55.589
[gasping]

01:24:55.822 --> 01:24:56.790

01:24:58.692 --> 01:25:00.028
[straining]

01:25:06.032 --> 01:25:07.035
Stay where you are.

01:25:08.135 --> 01:25:09.433
Be careful.

01:25:09.435 --> 01:25:10.869
Watch your step. Take it easy.

01:25:10.871 --> 01:25:12.436
Get out of the way.
Move over, move over!

01:25:12.438 --> 01:25:14.075

Get away. Get out.
Get it out now!

01:25:26.653 --> 01:25:29.357
[Uncle Cui] Don't follow me.
You all have families.

01:25:29.656 --> 01:25:30.757
I have no one.

01:25:33.493 --> 01:25:35.796
Whatever happens, from this
moment on, I accept my fate.

01:25:36.429 --> 01:25:37.331
So be it.

01:25:37.764 --> 01:25:38.665
So be it.

01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:40.600
So be it.

01:25:42.536 --> 01:25:44.102
Get the hell away from me!

01:25:44.104 --> 01:25:45.373
[screaming]

01:26:09.563 --> 01:26:10.861
[man] Uncle Cui!

01:26:10.863 --> 01:26:12.700
Uncle Cui!

01:26:19.872 --> 01:26:20.871
You called?

01:26:20.873 --> 01:26:22.841
I'm very proud to announce

01:26:22.843 --> 01:26:25.477
that this year's Mahjong
Champion is Uncle Cui!

01:26:25.479 --> 01:26:27.849
[cheering]

01:26:28.081 --> 01:26:29.517
Thanks to...

01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:31.082
one tile.

01:26:31.084 --> 01:26:32.150
[Yaogu] Uncle Cui?

01:26:32.152 --> 01:26:34.218
It's time to take back the keys.

01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:35.219
What are you doing?

01:26:35.221 --> 01:26:37.023
Uh, wait a minute, Yaogu.

01:26:37.491 --> 01:26:38.593
I appreciate your gesture,

01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:41.395
but the rules of the game
were already established.

01:26:41.761 --> 01:26:42.897
Yeah.

01:26:43.130 --> 01:26:45.500
Remember? This money's
going to the air force.

01:26:45.965 --> 01:26:47.100
You can keep the tea house.

01:26:48.167 --> 01:26:50.168
But I'm keeping this one tile
as a souvenir.

01:26:50.170 --> 01:26:52.603
Don't say that.
I've just announced it.

01:26:52.605 --> 01:26:54.873
You're trying to make me lose face.
These are yours.

01:26:54.875 --> 01:26:57.011
Look, let's get this straight.

01:26:57.544 --> 01:27:00.014
I'm just enjoying
being an honest winner.

01:27:00.246 --> 01:27:03.013
She handed the victory to you
on a plate.

01:27:03.015 --> 01:27:04.216
Not quite.

01:27:04.218 --> 01:27:06.051
- [shushing]
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:27:06.053 --> 01:27:08.589
I got it. We each take half
of the tea house.

01:27:08.855 --> 01:27:10.992
And Manguan and I
will run it for you.

01:27:12.259 --> 01:27:13.728
- Well?
- Well?

01:27:14.161 --> 01:27:15.196
What was that?

01:27:17.497 --> 01:27:18.198
What are you saying?

01:27:19.233 --> 01:27:20.435
I get half the profits...

01:27:21.934 --> 01:27:23.901
as co-owner, and yet
you two will do all the work?

01:27:23.903 --> 01:27:25.473
- Right.
- Right.

01:27:28.675 --> 01:27:30.211
I really like the sound of that.

01:27:32.813 --> 01:27:33.980
Manguan.

01:27:34.581 --> 01:27:36.047
You're like my new son.

01:27:36.049 --> 01:27:37.982
[all laugh]

01:27:37.984 --> 01:27:39.786
Thank you. Thank you.

01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:41.555
Thank you.

01:27:43.090 --> 01:27:43.991
Yes.

[Susan] <i>Minxun,</i>

01:27:53.768 --> 01:27:56.203
<i>I hate to leave you,
but I'm heading to the front.</i>

01:27:56.970 --> 01:28:00.105
<i>These pictures,
steeped in blood and tears,</i>

01:28:00.107 --> 01:28:03.577

and strength of our people.</i>

01:28:04.545 --> 01:28:07.547
<i>You're like a sword in the
dark, my darling Minxun.</i>

01:28:09.282 --> 01:28:11.785
<i>Your tight embrace
made me lose my fear of death.</i>

01:28:13.153 --> 01:28:14.555
<i>The pictures are for you.</i>

01:28:15.656 --> 01:28:18.024
<i>I hope they will remind
you of me and my camera.</i>

01:28:19.926 --> 01:28:21.996
<i>The Chinese culture
will live on.</i>

01:28:22.962 --> 01:28:26.867
<i>For the freedom and security of
our children and their children,</i>

01:28:27.667 --> 01:28:31.872
<i>we must defend this sacred
land with our lives.</i>
