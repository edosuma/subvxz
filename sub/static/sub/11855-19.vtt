WEBVTT

00:12.834 --> 00:15.083
(male #1)
'Those marchers in
the streets were just kids.'

00:15.166 --> 00:18.417
And the police were using
fire hoses and dogs on them.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.125
Filling their jails
with children.

00:20.208 --> 00:22.583
I'm just thankful
we left Biloxi.

00:22.667 --> 00:24.333
I think
Dr. King's right.

00:24.417 --> 00:26.083
That march
on Washington next month?

00:26.166 --> 00:27.667
That'll change people's minds.

00:27.750 --> 00:29.041
(male #2)
'Marching in the streets'

00:29.125 --> 00:30.208
isn't the answer, son.

00:30.291 --> 00:31.417
Then what is, pops?

00:31.500 --> 00:32.458
(man #2)
'Dignity..'

00:32.542 --> 00:34.959
...hard work, education.

00:35.041 --> 00:36.667
Things in life
that matter
most.

00:36.750 --> 00:38.834
Dr. King says
our lives begin to end

00:38.917 --> 00:41.250
the day we become silent
about the things that matter.

00:41.333 --> 00:43.000
(female #1)
'Your son's
got a point, Donald.'

00:43.083 --> 00:45.583
(Donald)
'Oh, my son?'

00:45.667 --> 00:47.291
Where you think he
get
all his sass from?

00:47.375 --> 00:48.375
From your mother's side

00:48.458 --> 00:50.542
but that's
a whole other story.

00:59.792 --> 01:01.375
Donald Williams?

01:01.458 --> 01:03.834
I'm Billy Jones.
TBL Defense Systems?

01:03.917 --> 01:05.750
[laughs]
Glad to finally meet you,
Billy.

01:05.834 --> 01:07.417
You're all moved in
then,
I suppose?

01:07.500 --> 01:09.125
Looking forward
to seeing the plant tomorrow.

01:09.208 --> 01:10.583
Why don't I take that
from you?

01:10.667 --> 01:11.875
Thank you.

01:14.709 --> 01:16.458
I'm Judith,
Billy's sister-in-law.

01:16.542 --> 01:19.375
- So pleased to meet you.
- 'Oh, Mary Williams.
Likewise.'

01:19.458 --> 01:22.166
Uh, this is my husband,
Donald,
and our son, Ezekiel.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.792
Uh, you can call me Zeke
for short, ma'am.

01:24.875 --> 01:26.125
Zeke it is then.

01:26.208 --> 01:28.917
My husband Henry's
around here somewhere.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.166
Sweetheart!

01:32.542 --> 01:34.750
'I understand you were
in the military, Mr.
Williams?'

01:34.834 --> 01:36.333
Did they train you
to work on planes?

01:36.417 --> 01:39.375
Well, actually, I'm an
engineer.
I build them.

01:39.458 --> 01:42.333
Mr. Williams will be
overseeing
operations at TBL.

01:42.417 --> 01:43.667
He's your boss, Billy?

01:43.750 --> 01:45.667
Henry, the Williams
are our new neighbors.

01:45.750 --> 01:48.417
They just came up
from Mississippi.

01:48.500 --> 01:51.458
Welcome. Better help Charlotte
get some dessert.

01:51.542 --> 01:52.625
(Billy)
'Jump in there, Zeke'

01:52.709 --> 01:54.709
before my niece gobbles
it all down.

01:54.792 --> 01:56.458
(Charlotte)
'Jell- O!'

01:56.542 --> 01:58.041
(Henry)
'I thought you wanted cake,
Charlotte.'

01:58.125 --> 01:59.750
I don't like
cake, daddy.

01:59.834 --> 02:03.166
Sure you do.
You love cake.

02:17.083 --> 02:19.917
(Martin Luther King Jr.)
'...we will be able to work
together, to pray together'

02:20.000 --> 02:22.917
to struggle together,
to go to jail together.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.166
'To stand up for freedom..'

02:45.709 --> 02:47.375
Holy moley.

02:47.458 --> 02:48.417
What is that?

02:48.500 --> 02:50.750
Let's get out of here.

02:50.834 --> 02:52.125
It's a kid.

02:54.792 --> 02:56.583
(kid #1)
'Don't touch it, Willy.'

02:56.667 --> 02:59.125
The fuzz will put you
in the slammer.

03:29.333 --> 03:32.500
Last known address
was this flophouse.

03:32.583 --> 03:35.333
Word on the street is
our guy surfaces
today.

03:35.417 --> 03:38.417
He's been wanted on
this warrant for six months.

03:38.500 --> 03:39.625
He better surface.

03:39.709 --> 03:41.834
This his posse?

03:45.417 --> 03:47.041
(Rush)
'Will?'

03:49.000 --> 03:50.375
Hey.

03:50.458 --> 03:52.208
What is it?

03:52.291 --> 03:55.333
A body was found
here.
42 years ago.

03:55.417 --> 03:56.667
Whose body?

03:56.750 --> 03:58.458
A 16-year-old boy.

03:58.542 --> 04:00.125
'Zeke Williams.'

04:00.208 --> 04:01.291
(Rush)
'Cold job?'

04:01.375 --> 04:03.125
(Jeffries)
'Never came in.'

04:03.208 --> 04:06.834
Every year folks
would
leave flowers.

04:06.917 --> 04:08.834
Not this year.

04:08.917 --> 04:11.083
People forget.

04:12.917 --> 04:16.542
I was the one
who found him, Lil.

04:20.625 --> 04:22.750
I never forgot.

04:57.083 --> 04:59.041
Hey, Scotty.

05:00.458 --> 05:02.875
Oh, we miss you at
first Thursdays.

05:02.959 --> 05:05.375
But don't worry, we had a
couple
cocktails put on your tab.

05:05.458 --> 05:07.041
Live it up.

05:07.125 --> 05:09.250
Looks like you were
living it up yourself.

05:09.333 --> 05:11.959
Nah, just, uh...
under the weather.

05:12.041 --> 05:13.375
Can't keep up with
the barmaid, huh?

05:13.458 --> 05:15.542
Will you drop it, already?

05:15.625 --> 05:17.083
Hey, Scotty. Take it easy.

05:17.166 --> 05:19.709
Hey, nothing.
You tell him to take it
easy.

05:21.125 --> 05:22.667
Just messing with ya.

05:28.583 --> 05:30.542
I'm heading in.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.500
Smelling like a brewery, too.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.792
Ezekiel Williams. 16.

05:43.875 --> 05:44.917
Parents reported
him
missing

05:45.000 --> 05:48.417
night of
August
27, 1963.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.166
Next day his body was found.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.875
Yeah,
in gang territory.

05:51.959 --> 05:53.250
19th and diamond posse

05:53.333 --> 05:55.250
AKA 19 diamonds

05:55.333 --> 05:56.667
ran that turf.

05:56.750 --> 05:59.583
Theory was Zeke's murder
was drug related.

05:59.667 --> 06:02.750
Zeke was a straight "A"
student,
no prior drug

06:02.834 --> 06:04.000
or criminal history.

06:04.083 --> 06:07.041
Yep. Kids like me
ran those streets

06:07.125 --> 06:09.417
dreamt of being
a diamond one day.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.208
Not kids like Zeke.

06:11.291 --> 06:13.250
Gangster dreams, huh, Will?

06:13.333 --> 06:16.917
Yeah, hmm.
Now I'm one of the good guys.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.834
(Rush)
Petechial hemorrhaging

06:18.917 --> 06:20.125
possible suffocation.

06:20.208 --> 06:23.333
Body was beaten
too badly to be
sure.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.625
This kind of damage you'd have
a river of blood

06:25.709 --> 06:27.250
flowing through that playground.

06:27.333 --> 06:29.166
No mention of blood
in the scene notes.

06:29.250 --> 06:30.583
Body was moved?

06:30.667 --> 06:32.750
Moved from where?

06:34.166 --> 06:35.792
What's that?

06:35.875 --> 06:38.458
(Jeffries)
'Cops back then thought it
was some kind of code.'

06:38.542 --> 06:40.208
Couldn't make
heads or tails.

06:40.291 --> 06:42.667
Maybe we get lucky
this time around.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.250
Maybe.

06:56.875 --> 06:59.500
It broke Mary's heart.

06:59.583 --> 07:02.333
She followed Zeke
shortly after.

07:02.417 --> 07:04.041
(Jeffries)
'And your wife thought
Zeke's murder'

07:04.125 --> 07:05.625
was racially motivated.

07:05.709 --> 07:07.500
We both did.

07:07.583 --> 07:09.000
Police
wouldn't
listen.

07:09.083 --> 07:11.000
Northerners never
could face

07:11.083 --> 07:13.125
their own Emmett Tills.

07:13.208 --> 07:14.792
Why do you say that,
Mr. Williams?

07:14.875 --> 07:19.333
Back then racism was supposed
to be a southern vice.

07:19.417 --> 07:21.792
But the north had
its own version.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.500
'Just as deadly.'

07:23.583 --> 07:26.291
Especially, when
a black man was boss.

07:26.375 --> 07:27.375
(Jeffries)
'Zeke had a run-in'

07:27.458 --> 07:28.834
with someone on your job?

07:28.917 --> 07:30.333
He got a taste firsthand

07:30.417 --> 07:33.667
of what I had to go through
every day.

07:35.291 --> 07:39.417
Bell UH-1s. Defense
contract.
Top of the line.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.375
You tell all these people
what to do, pops?

07:41.458 --> 07:43.542
I oversee engineering
and quality control.

07:43.625 --> 07:45.208
Meaning you're the boss.

07:45.291 --> 07:46.917
A man is
limited
to nothing..

07:47.000 --> 07:49.125
But his dreams.

07:50.750 --> 07:53.208
Noticed some problems in the
fuel system flow switches.

07:53.291 --> 07:55.375
You want to
double check those.

07:56.667 --> 08:00.875
Lunch ended ten minutes ago.
Let's go.

08:02.625 --> 08:04.083
Get back on the floor
before I dock you

08:04.166 --> 08:06.125
the rest of the day.

08:06.208 --> 08:07.500
I'm taking a smoke first.

08:07.583 --> 08:09.375
You heard the man.
Quit your dilly dallyin'.

08:09.458 --> 08:10.834
Can't I get a smoke first,
Billy?

08:10.917 --> 08:14.875
No. Get on the floor.

08:14.959 --> 08:16.959
Got to give 'em a kick
time to time..

08:17.041 --> 08:18.333
...that's how we
run things here.

08:18.417 --> 08:20.875
Yeah, you tell him, boss.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.917
You said it, boss.

08:24.458 --> 08:28.500
You going to stand by
and watch that, pops?

08:28.583 --> 08:30.083
He's not your boss.

08:30.166 --> 08:32.583
My father is.

08:34.250 --> 08:35.250
Boy's got a mouth on him.

08:35.333 --> 08:36.917
What'd you call him?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.166
Ain't a man, is he?

08:39.333 --> 08:42.417
That's all
he meant, Donald.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.083
Let's go, fellas.
Come on.

08:56.166 --> 08:59.667
I'll never forget
the look on Zeke's face.

08:59.750 --> 09:01.125
'I disappointed him.'

09:01.208 --> 09:04.250
Zeke have any other encounters
with your employees?

09:04.333 --> 09:06.417
I wasn't
inclined
to have
another

09:06.500 --> 09:08.125
"Bring your son to work" day.

09:08.208 --> 09:09.792
So...no.

09:09.875 --> 09:12.083
And you told the cops all
this
back then?

09:12.166 --> 09:13.500
I did.

09:13.583 --> 09:16.542
So why do you care now?

09:19.834 --> 09:23.458
I was the one who found Zeke
in the playground.

09:24.375 --> 09:25.792
That's why we're here..

09:25.875 --> 09:28.458
to try to make it right.

09:29.375 --> 09:32.333
You're 42 years late, son.

09:40.041 --> 09:41.166
Zeke was stepping
out of line.

09:41.250 --> 09:42.709
He should have known better.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.834
So maybe your boys
decided to..

09:46.917 --> 09:49.000
...school him
in the proper etiquette.

09:49.083 --> 09:50.875
(Billy)
'They weren't my boys.'

09:50.959 --> 09:53.500
And they were young and dumb
but...not dangerous.

09:53.583 --> 09:57.250
You didn't agree with their
...philosophical outlook?

09:57.333 --> 10:00.500
I was there for the job and
the paycheck, not the
politics.

10:00.583 --> 10:03.125
Did they ever bring up this
incident with Zeke again?

10:03.208 --> 10:05.500
(Billy)
'Not to me.
They knew how I stood on it.'

10:05.583 --> 10:06.834
Boss's kid.

10:06.917 --> 10:08.750
Huh. Leave it alone.

10:08.834 --> 10:11.417
Well someone didn't...
leave it alone.

10:13.125 --> 10:17.000
If you've got something to
say,
now's the time.

10:19.375 --> 10:21.208
Look..

10:21.291 --> 10:23.792
...Zeke, he was a good kid..

10:23.875 --> 10:24.917
But?

10:26.458 --> 10:28.959
Even good kids
play with fire.

10:31.458 --> 10:35.250
Henry just doesn't understand
how heavy groceries can be.

10:35.333 --> 10:37.500
Well, maybe you should learn
how to drive, Judith.

10:37.583 --> 10:40.458
Oh-ho. Silly me on the road?

10:40.542 --> 10:42.458
That's what
Henry would say.

10:43.542 --> 10:44.792
(Zeke)
'She barged onto mine!'

10:44.875 --> 10:46.667
'I'm not leaving
until I get my flag!'

10:48.458 --> 10:51.166
What's going on here?

10:51.250 --> 10:53.208
Where's Charlotte?

10:53.291 --> 10:54.542
What are you doing?

10:54.625 --> 10:55.583
Mommy?

10:55.667 --> 10:57.959
Oh, my God!

10:58.041 --> 10:59.083
It's not what you think

10:59.166 --> 11:00.208
'Miss Judith.'

11:00.291 --> 11:01.917
You just walk
into my brother's house

11:02.000 --> 11:04.208
'to chase some tail?'

11:06.959 --> 11:09.125
Carrying on
in front of a child!

11:11.667 --> 11:13.792
And you never told
the cops this?

11:13.875 --> 11:15.083
Or your boss?

11:15.166 --> 11:16.583
I thought it wasn't
any of my business.

11:16.667 --> 11:18.834
Whatever he was doing
with that maid, Mathilde.

11:18.917 --> 11:20.250
But you think that..

11:20.333 --> 11:22.291
..."whatever" is what
got him killed.

11:22.375 --> 11:25.625
I thought Mathilde already
had a boyfriend.

11:25.709 --> 11:27.250
Real unsavory fellow, too.

11:27.333 --> 11:29.000
What do you mean?

11:29.083 --> 11:31.083
Heard he dealt dope.

11:31.166 --> 11:34.500
He hung out with one of those
gangs from North Philly.

11:34.583 --> 11:36.417
North Philly?

11:36.500 --> 11:38.083
You know what gang?

11:38.166 --> 11:41.834
They called themselves
the 19 diamonds, I think.

11:42.834 --> 11:44.917
'Crazy name, huh?'

11:50.125 --> 11:51.250
Zeke was in over his head.

11:51.333 --> 11:52.625
Hooked up with a gang
member's girlfriend.

11:52.709 --> 11:54.500
19th and Diamond ruled
the roost in '63.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.208
Spoke the language
of retribution.

11:56.291 --> 11:57.458
We get a name
on this boyfriend?

11:57.542 --> 11:59.208
Still looking
for surviving members.

11:59.291 --> 12:01.125
And shelf life being
what it is on the
street

12:01.208 --> 12:02.458
we're lucky
if we find
any.

12:02.542 --> 12:03.542
What about Mathilde?

12:03.625 --> 12:04.500
Auto tracked her.

12:04.583 --> 12:05.709
She's not in
the State of PA.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.125
Valens and Vera'll
check it out.

12:07.208 --> 12:08.959
This kid she took care of,
you find her?

12:09.041 --> 12:11.625
Charlotte Jones.
She's in Center
City.

12:11.709 --> 12:14.000
Maybe she's got
some answers.

12:17.542 --> 12:21.917
It's a place I used
to play as a child.

12:23.375 --> 12:26.041
I was nine when Zeke died.

12:26.125 --> 12:28.333
Do you remember the time
your mother and Uncle
Billy

12:28.417 --> 12:30.125
found Zeke in the house?

12:30.208 --> 12:31.417
Yes, I do.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.417
Were there other guys ever
coming around the house

12:33.500 --> 12:34.500
looking for Mathilde?

12:34.583 --> 12:35.834
No.

12:35.917 --> 12:36.959
Mathilde had a boyfriend,
though.

12:37.041 --> 12:38.667
Someone besides Zeke?

12:38.750 --> 12:40.834
If she did, I never knew.

12:40.917 --> 12:43.667
'She loved Zeke like
he was her one and only.'

12:43.750 --> 12:46.834
Even as a kid
I could see that.

12:46.917 --> 12:48.333
That day
was the first time

12:48.417 --> 12:50.333
they ever met.

12:50.417 --> 12:51.959
Did he come in to look for her?

12:52.041 --> 12:55.125
- No...me.
- Why?

12:55.208 --> 12:59.166
Oh, some neighborhood kids
and I...stole his flag

12:59.250 --> 13:01.458
off his front porch.

13:01.542 --> 13:02.500
He caught us.

13:02.583 --> 13:04.500
They got away.
I didn't.

13:04.583 --> 13:06.375
So he chased you
into your house?

13:06.458 --> 13:08.375
He didn't hurt me,
if that's what you're
thinking.

13:08.458 --> 13:10.375
Then what'd he do?

13:10.458 --> 13:13.834
Hmm. He made his move.

13:16.125 --> 13:17.959
You sure they won't get mad,
Tommy?

13:18.041 --> 13:20.166
See the cross on that flag,
Charlotte?

13:20.250 --> 13:21.959
Negroes are real religious.

13:22.041 --> 13:24.083
They like crosses.

13:24.166 --> 13:26.250
Come on. Give me that.

13:34.125 --> 13:35.875
What're you doing?

13:35.959 --> 13:38.834
Tommy said
Negroes like crosses.

13:38.917 --> 13:40.917
Give it back.

13:42.542 --> 13:45.041
I said give me
my flag back!

14:11.250 --> 14:13.166
(Mathilde)
'How many times I gotta
tell you, Charlotte?'

14:13.250 --> 14:15.583
Quit slammin' that door!

14:15.667 --> 14:17.583
I want my flag.

14:17.667 --> 14:19.250
What do you think
you're doin' in here?

14:19.333 --> 14:20.917
Girl who lives
here took my flag.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.250
- I'd like it back.
- You gotta leave right now.

14:23.333 --> 14:25.083
You can't just barge
onto other people's property!

14:25.166 --> 14:27.417
She barged onto mine!

14:27.500 --> 14:29.250
I'm not leaving
until I get my flag.

14:31.959 --> 14:34.542
Alright. Stay here.
And keep quiet!

14:34.625 --> 14:36.959
I-I'm Zeke..

14:37.041 --> 14:39.083
...by-by the way.

14:40.750 --> 14:42.875
Mathilde
.
Hi.

14:44.375 --> 14:45.500
(Billy)
'What's going on here?'

14:45.583 --> 14:47.625
Where's Charlotte?

14:47.709 --> 14:48.959
What're you doing?

14:49.041 --> 14:50.542
Mommy?

14:50.625 --> 14:51.792
Oh, my God!

14:52.875 --> 14:54.792
It's not what you think,
Mrs. Judith.

14:54.875 --> 14:56.542
You just walk
into my brother's house

14:56.625 --> 14:58.834
'to chase some tail?'

15:01.000 --> 15:01.959
Mathilde!

15:02.041 --> 15:03.875
How could you bring that boy
in here?

15:03.959 --> 15:05.625
Miss Judith,
I can explain.

15:05.709 --> 15:06.792
Did he touch you, baby?

15:06.875 --> 15:09.709
Uh-uh.
He touched
that.

15:09.792 --> 15:12.500
I can
explain,
Miss Judith.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.625
Like I said..

15:18.709 --> 15:22.208
...Zeke made his move,
the Ruy Lopez.

15:22.917 --> 15:24.375
What's that?

15:24.458 --> 15:29.000
White knight to f3,
black knight to c6.

15:29.083 --> 15:31.500
'It's a chess opening.'

15:31.583 --> 15:34.667
That's what the piece
of paper was...chess moves.

15:34.750 --> 15:36.500
So, Zeke was a chess player.

15:36.583 --> 15:39.166
A very good one.

15:39.250 --> 15:41.000
And so was my mother.

15:41.083 --> 15:42.500
That's why she was smiling.

15:42.583 --> 15:45.542
She knew she had finally met
her match.

15:45.625 --> 15:47.333
Your mother and Zeke
met again?

15:47.417 --> 15:49.583
Every afternoon.

15:49.667 --> 15:51.834
Mathilde and I
would watch the games.

15:51.917 --> 15:53.333
It was our secret.

15:53.417 --> 15:55.166
So how long did this
go on for?

15:55.250 --> 15:57.792
Till the day Zeke died.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.542
Your daughter says
your chess games

16:08.625 --> 16:11.709
were a secret, Mrs. Jones.

16:11.792 --> 16:12.917
'Why?'

16:15.250 --> 16:16.750
Back then, it was one thing

16:16.834 --> 16:19.291
sharing potluck
with your black neighbors

16:19.375 --> 16:22.667
another thing inviting
their grown sons into your
home.

16:24.125 --> 16:27.083
The world wasn't ready
for your kind of
friendship?

16:27.166 --> 16:30.625
The world treated me
like a dumb housewife

16:30.709 --> 16:32.000
Zeke like a boy.

16:32.083 --> 16:35.041
We treated each other
like much more.

16:35.125 --> 16:37.041
He was my friend.

16:37.125 --> 16:38.667
You never told the
police
about your games

16:38.750 --> 16:40.208
after he was murdered?

16:40.291 --> 16:42.208
I didn't think
our games had anything to do

16:42.291 --> 16:43.959
with what happened to Zeke.

16:44.041 --> 16:46.583
No one in my world knew.

16:46.667 --> 16:49.083
How 'bout his?

16:49.166 --> 16:51.750
Zeke and I went out
in public once.

16:51.834 --> 16:54.166
We didn't think
anyone would mind

16:54.250 --> 16:57.125
because we'd be among our own.

16:57.208 --> 16:59.750
Your own?

16:59.834 --> 17:04.417
People who loved nothing more
than the game.

17:04.500 --> 17:07.875
(Zeke)
'Best players in Philadelphia
are in this park.'

17:07.959 --> 17:10.417
I heard a grand master's
coming next Wednesday.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.583
Are you planning to go?

17:12.667 --> 17:15.458
I was hoping to go to
Washington
that day for the march.

17:15.542 --> 17:18.417
Father doesn't believe in
that
stuff. He'd never let me.

17:18.500 --> 17:21.417
You'll find a way,
if you really want
to.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.208
You think I should go?

17:23.291 --> 17:24.959
A great man once said

17:25.041 --> 17:27.458
"Our lives begin to end
the day we become
silent..

17:27.542 --> 17:28.917
...about the things
that matter."

17:29.000 --> 17:32.125
I think you should do
what you believe is right,
Zeke.

17:35.667 --> 17:38.375
Can I ask you something,
Mrs. Jones?

17:38.458 --> 17:40.709
When a young lady
likes someone..

17:40.792 --> 17:42.542
...how can you tell?

17:42.625 --> 17:44.375
By the way she acts.

17:44.458 --> 17:49.417
She smiles a lot...
laughs at
little things.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.959
Like the way
Mathilde
does..

17:52.041 --> 17:54.750
...when you're around.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.041
Clyde?

18:02.667 --> 18:03.875
Didn't know you played.

18:03.959 --> 18:05.500
Uh, you know
Mrs. Jones,
right?

18:05.583 --> 18:08.166
Blitz, one minute each,
you play white.

18:08.250 --> 18:11.333
Seems you got
an affinity for it.

18:11.417 --> 18:13.500
Like brother Malcolm said,
"Your coffee gets weak

18:13.583 --> 18:15.583
you mix in the cream."

18:15.667 --> 18:16.834
Thought we were playing
a game here.

18:16.917 --> 18:19.041
Question is,
what're you playin'?

18:19.125 --> 18:21.458
Black stud
to your white queen?

18:21.542 --> 18:22.834
Maybe we should go, Zeke.

18:22.917 --> 18:25.041
Don't talk
about
her like that!

18:27.166 --> 18:30.500
"Man who doesn't stand for
something falls for anything."

18:30.583 --> 18:31.834
Malcolm X.

18:31.917 --> 18:34.083
"We must learn to live
together
as brothers

18:34.166 --> 18:36.291
or perish together as fools."

18:36.375 --> 18:38.417
Dr. Martin Luther King.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.166
Who's the fool here

18:40.250 --> 18:43.166
black man thinks he's white?

18:43.250 --> 18:45.834
Least I know what I am.

18:45.917 --> 18:49.250
But not who.

18:49.333 --> 18:50.500
Clock ran out.

18:50.583 --> 18:51.625
I win.

18:55.458 --> 19:00.875
"Be peaceful, be courteous,
obey the law, respect
everyone."

19:00.959 --> 19:02.709
Malcolm said that, too.

19:02.792 --> 19:05.041
"But someone puts his hand
on you

19:05.125 --> 19:08.250
send him to the cemetery."

19:08.333 --> 19:12.417
Forgot the last part...
fool.

19:19.041 --> 19:21.375
Who was this Clyde?

19:21.458 --> 19:22.583
He did gardening work

19:22.667 --> 19:25.333
in the neighborhood
from time to time.

19:25.417 --> 19:27.709
You two ever have
any other run-ins with
him?

19:27.792 --> 19:29.750
I never went back there.

19:29.834 --> 19:32.375
Zeke may have,
I don't know.

19:32.458 --> 19:36.166
And where was this,
uh, chess park
located?

19:36.250 --> 19:38.625
Up near Temple University.

19:38.709 --> 19:41.375
19th street and Diamond.

19:42.583 --> 19:44.917
That's where Zeke's
body
was found.

19:45.667 --> 19:46.750
Yeah.

19:48.375 --> 19:49.834
Zeke was found
a block away

19:49.917 --> 19:53.083
from your little chess club,
Clyde.

19:54.291 --> 19:56.041
Wasn't my chess club.

19:56.125 --> 19:58.375
Open to the public,
as far as I knew.

19:58.458 --> 20:00.709
But not to the white public.

20:02.667 --> 20:04.875
Boss man sent you in here..

20:04.959 --> 20:06.458
...talk to the black man?

20:09.375 --> 20:13.291
You got a penchant for
assaulting police
officers.

20:13.375 --> 20:15.000
Black police officers.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.625
Oxymoron, you ask me.

20:18.709 --> 20:20.625
Sellouts, race traitors, right?

20:20.709 --> 20:22.375
Blind, deaf and dumb is
more like it.

20:22.458 --> 20:23.792
(Jeffries)
'And Zeke was
the worst kind'

20:23.875 --> 20:25.375
of blind, deaf and dumb

20:25.458 --> 20:28.291
fraternizing with
a white woman.

20:28.375 --> 20:32.208
I didn't have a problem
with the white woman, junior.

20:32.291 --> 20:34.375
I had a problem
with that woman.

20:34.458 --> 20:35.583
Mrs. Jones?

20:35.667 --> 20:37.125
(Clyde)
'That's right.'

20:37.208 --> 20:38.834
Why's that?

20:38.917 --> 20:41.959
Missus get her hair done
every Tuesday.

20:42.041 --> 20:44.500
Blind, deaf and dumb
as to what goes on

20:44.583 --> 20:47.083
in her own house.

20:47.166 --> 20:50.417
Figured one Tuesday
I'd share with Zeke.

20:56.959 --> 20:59.375
Missus's barely outta
the house

20:59.458 --> 21:01.166
and already
it's starting up.

21:01.250 --> 21:03.959
What're we doing
here, Clyde?

21:04.041 --> 21:06.667
Told you there's something
you should see.

21:07.709 --> 21:09.625
I'm not looking in there!

21:09.709 --> 21:10.667
Get over here!

21:10.750 --> 21:12.625
Uh-uh. I'm leaving.

21:12.709 --> 21:14.917
(Clyde)
'You like that girl,
don't you?'

21:15.000 --> 21:16.166
Mathilde?

21:18.583 --> 21:19.709
Listen.

21:51.125 --> 21:53.500
You love white people
so much?

21:58.041 --> 22:00.125
See how they love you back?

22:04.667 --> 22:06.792
Turned up dead the next day.

22:10.166 --> 22:12.333
Zeke do something
about what he saw?

22:14.375 --> 22:17.125
Musta done somethin'.

22:17.208 --> 22:19.291
He dead, ain't he?

22:25.750 --> 22:27.542
The one doer worth finding
is six feet under.

22:27.625 --> 22:29.250
Henry Jones went
out of this world

22:29.333 --> 22:31.542
a rich, happy man.
Three years ago.

22:31.625 --> 22:35.125
We think Judith knew about
her husband's indiscretions?

22:35.208 --> 22:37.125
Sounded like she
was out of the loop.

22:37.208 --> 22:38.917
How about Mathilde?
We find her yet?

22:39.000 --> 22:41.542
Still looking. Turns out
she wasn't Philly-born.

22:41.625 --> 22:44.250
Uh, family was from
outside
Wilmington, Delaware.

22:44.333 --> 22:45.542
Came up here for work.

22:45.625 --> 22:48.125
Left town the day before
Zeke was murdered.

22:48.208 --> 22:49.667
Wonder what made her run.

22:49.750 --> 22:52.792
Well, maybe this, a complaint
filed at the old Sex Crimes
Unit

22:52.875 --> 22:54.583
by Mathilde Jefferson.

22:54.667 --> 22:56.083
Report of a rape.

22:56.166 --> 23:00.250
Accompanying her was a " Negro
male companion. Unidentified."

23:00.333 --> 23:02.375
- Could be Zeke.
- Must be Zeke.

23:02.458 --> 23:04.834
Young girl, no family. Who
else
could she have turned to?

23:04.917 --> 23:06.417
Who's the officer on the report?

23:06.500 --> 23:07.625
No officer listed.

23:07.709 --> 23:08.667
The only name we've got

23:08.750 --> 23:10.166
is the secretary
who typed it up.

23:10.250 --> 23:11.208
Linda O'Hara.

23:11.291 --> 23:12.917
We know where she is?

23:13.000 --> 23:14.250
In town, still
alive and kicking.

23:19.291 --> 23:20.959
(O'Hara)
'It's Miss O'Hara.'

23:21.041 --> 23:22.583
Never did have a ball and chain.

23:24.166 --> 23:27.625
'Bout time they got some
female detectives on the
force.

23:27.709 --> 23:30.542
They didn't let girls
in the club till '73.

23:30.625 --> 23:32.959
Pretty rough
for female cops back then?

23:33.041 --> 23:34.500
Rough?

23:34.583 --> 23:37.291
Commissioner put first-timers
on the worst drug corners.

23:37.375 --> 23:40.667
No patrol cars, no backup.

23:40.750 --> 23:43.458
Can't live with 'em,
can't kill 'em off.

23:43.542 --> 23:45.625
Yeah. You got that right.

23:46.667 --> 23:48.333
Never got past secretary myself.

23:48.417 --> 23:50.417
Their loss, you ask me.

23:50.500 --> 23:53.041
Right. You remember
this report you filed?

23:53.125 --> 23:55.166
Back in '63?

23:57.458 --> 23:59.250
Course I do.

23:59.333 --> 24:02.333
My superiors wouldn't
let me. Did it anyway.

24:02.417 --> 24:04.000
Why didn't they let you?

24:04.083 --> 24:07.792
Back then, they said rape was
when a lady changed her mind.

24:09.375 --> 24:11.417
But you believed Mathilde.

24:11.500 --> 24:13.166
She was a brave little girl.

24:13.250 --> 24:14.542
So was her friend.

24:14.625 --> 24:16.834
I was the only one
who believed 'em.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.250
And you saw what
happened, young man?

24:23.667 --> 24:26.250
Told you they'd listen.

24:26.333 --> 24:28.291
What's going on, Linda?

24:28.375 --> 24:31.291
This young girl was...raped.

24:33.709 --> 24:35.750
That right, miss?

24:40.625 --> 24:42.834
You know the person
who did this to you?

24:44.750 --> 24:47.709
His name is Henry Jones.

24:47.792 --> 24:49.875
(Zeke)
'He runs Emerson Bank.'

24:51.291 --> 24:53.333
I know who he is.

25:02.125 --> 25:04.125
Take it.

25:15.166 --> 25:16.750
Show me what he did.

25:16.834 --> 25:19.250
- What?
- This isn't right, sir.

25:19.333 --> 25:21.750
She wants to charge
a man with rape?

25:21.834 --> 25:23.917
She proves it first.

25:26.875 --> 25:28.875
Show me.

25:36.834 --> 25:39.208
Stick it in.

25:39.291 --> 25:41.709
Come on.

25:41.792 --> 25:43.041
'Come on.'

25:43.125 --> 25:44.125
Come on.

25:45.750 --> 25:47.792
Stick it in.

25:52.875 --> 25:55.792
Can't rape a woman
if she don't let you.

25:57.542 --> 26:00.500
But you can make her
let ya, sir.

26:02.208 --> 26:03.125
Zeke!

26:03.208 --> 26:04.500
'You're under arrest.'

26:04.583 --> 26:06.750
For assaulting
a police officer.

26:06.834 --> 26:08.917
'Get him outta here.'

26:15.709 --> 26:17.792
And throw that damn thing away.

26:23.834 --> 26:26.000
Right after that..

26:26.083 --> 26:28.500
...sergeant went to
the phone, made a
call.

26:28.583 --> 26:29.667
To who?

26:29.750 --> 26:31.250
Henry Jones.

26:31.333 --> 26:33.500
I heard him yakkin'
about how he couldn't
let

26:33.583 --> 26:35.375
some uppity colored boy..

26:35.458 --> 26:37.959
...humiliate an
upstanding
citizen.

26:38.041 --> 26:39.959
Blah, blah, blah.

26:40.041 --> 26:42.166
How long was Zeke
there that night?

26:42.250 --> 26:44.750
Well, my shift
ended at
midnight.

26:44.834 --> 26:47.333
That poor boy was still
in the cell when I left.

26:50.500 --> 26:52.583
And you never reported this?

26:53.542 --> 26:55.959
After Zeke was found dead?

26:56.041 --> 26:58.542
Who would I report it to?

26:58.625 --> 26:59.750
The police?

27:04.625 --> 27:06.000
(Jeffries)
'Report wasn't in the box'

27:06.083 --> 27:08.375
because Zeke was never
officially arrested.

27:08.458 --> 27:11.375
And we've got no record
of who got him out.

27:11.458 --> 27:13.291
While making it
real easy for our
Sergeant

27:13.375 --> 27:15.709
to call up Henry
and hold Zeke unofficially.

27:15.792 --> 27:19.000
Until our upstanding citizen
shows up to claim him.

27:19.083 --> 27:21.375
Well, maybe
Mathilde
saw it go down.

27:21.458 --> 27:23.542
'She was at
the station earlier.'

27:23.625 --> 27:25.917
Any luck findin' her yet?

27:26.000 --> 27:28.959
Yeah. Yeah, found her.

27:31.667 --> 27:34.083
You found Mathilde?

27:34.166 --> 27:37.875
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Thought I told you. She's,
uh..

27:37.959 --> 27:39.667
'...living on the
Jersey Shore.'

27:39.750 --> 27:41.166
Ocean City.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.375
Thanks for the heads-up.

27:43.458 --> 27:45.542
Don't put yourself out.

27:51.625 --> 27:53.792
Hold on a second, Scotty.

27:53.875 --> 27:56.583
You, uh,
you found our witness

27:56.667 --> 27:59.083
didn't bother lettin' us know?

27:59.166 --> 28:02.583
Hey, ma. Sorry, okay?
I thought I did.

28:02.667 --> 28:04.709
You didn't.

28:10.125 --> 28:11.792
- 'You been drinking.'
- No.

28:11.875 --> 28:13.417
No, that's...that's crazy.

28:13.500 --> 28:15.583
I can smell it on you, Scotty.

28:18.208 --> 28:20.250
Well, look..

28:22.166 --> 28:24.750
I was off the clock
at lunch, so I..

28:24.834 --> 28:26.834
I'm fine.

28:29.417 --> 28:31.625
'I've given you
every shot I can, pal.'

28:32.667 --> 28:33.750
You get yourself cleaned up.

28:33.834 --> 28:36.166
You do your job or you're gone.

28:36.250 --> 28:38.291
'You get me?'

28:41.834 --> 28:43.834
Get out.

28:56.583 --> 28:58.333
I was 16.

28:58.417 --> 29:00.792
Alone in the big city.

29:00.875 --> 29:03.125
Family miles away.

29:03.208 --> 29:05.083
Zeke was my first love.

29:05.166 --> 29:07.625
Didn't ever wonder why
he never contacted you

29:07.709 --> 29:08.959
after you left Philly?

29:09.041 --> 29:11.458
I thought he forgot about me.

29:11.542 --> 29:13.834
What'd you do
after Zeke got
arrested?

29:13.917 --> 29:17.542
I waited outside the
station house for
hours.

29:17.625 --> 29:20.166
Scared, alone.

29:20.250 --> 29:21.500
And then she showed up.

29:21.583 --> 29:22.709
Who?

29:22.792 --> 29:24.291
Miss Judith.

29:24.375 --> 29:27.125
Judith Jones?

29:27.208 --> 29:29.166
I thought she'd come to help.

29:29.250 --> 29:30.500
Being Zeke's friend and all.

29:31.875 --> 29:34.041
But she was
the furthest thing from it.

29:41.417 --> 29:43.208
- Mrs. Jones.
- Zeke?

29:43.291 --> 29:46.333
- 'Did they hurt you?'
- 'I want you out of my
house.'

29:46.417 --> 29:47.834
Tonight.

29:47.917 --> 29:50.166
'Don't bother picking
up your things.'

29:50.250 --> 29:51.250
What's goin' on?

29:51.333 --> 29:53.000
And you.

29:53.083 --> 29:55.583
I never want to see you again.

29:55.667 --> 29:58.125
'I got a call
from Sergeant Butowsky.'

29:58.208 --> 30:00.250
He told me what
you were doing here.

30:00.333 --> 30:02.166
'It's not Mathilde's fault.'

30:02.250 --> 30:03.583
Or mine.

30:03.667 --> 30:05.000
What your husband did..

30:05.083 --> 30:09.542
Why couldn't you just
keep your mouth shut?

30:09.625 --> 30:12.500
You once told me to do
what you believe is right.

30:12.583 --> 30:13.625
Well, I was wrong.

30:13.709 --> 30:15.166
And that our lives begin to end

30:15.250 --> 30:19.041
the day we become silent
about the things that matter?

30:19.125 --> 30:20.750
Remember, Mrs. Jones?

30:25.750 --> 30:28.208
Didn't this place
teach you, Zeke?

30:28.291 --> 30:30.333
What you have to say..

30:30.417 --> 30:32.458
...doesn't matter.

30:34.542 --> 30:37.208
Maybe here it doesn't.

30:37.291 --> 30:40.291
But to those people going
to Washington tomorrow..

30:40.375 --> 30:41.875
...to Dr. King..

30:41.959 --> 30:43.959
...it matters.

30:44.041 --> 30:45.417
If that's where I need
to go to get someone

30:45.500 --> 30:47.417
'to hear me, then I'll go.'

30:47.500 --> 30:49.375
Tonight.

30:49.458 --> 30:51.291
Tell the truth.

30:52.417 --> 30:53.709
Wanna come?

30:57.000 --> 30:59.083
Thank you, Officer.

31:06.500 --> 31:08.083
Go to Washington.

31:08.166 --> 31:10.250
Go wherever you want, Zeke.

31:10.333 --> 31:12.208
Just get out of here.

31:12.291 --> 31:14.166
Get out of my life..

31:14.250 --> 31:16.333
...and don't you ever come back.

31:26.583 --> 31:29.250
It was almost morning
when we left.

31:29.333 --> 31:31.959
Zeke walked me
to the train
station..

31:32.041 --> 31:35.625
Spent his last dime on
my ticket back to
Wilmington.

31:35.709 --> 31:37.959
Promised he'd come back
for me one day.

31:38.041 --> 31:40.083
Where'd he go after that?

31:40.166 --> 31:42.166
He was going
to hitch-hike,
walk..

31:42.250 --> 31:44.709
...do whatever it took
to get to Washington DC.

31:44.792 --> 31:47.125
For the march.

31:47.208 --> 31:49.583
Zeke meant what he said.

31:49.667 --> 31:51.083
Always did.

31:55.375 --> 31:58.166
And only one other person
knew where he was headed.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.750
The day he was killed.

31:59.834 --> 32:02.375
Mrs. Jones.
His supposed
friend.

32:08.750 --> 32:10.041
Now, the world wasn't ready
for your kind of friendship.

32:10.125 --> 32:11.083
'That right, Judith?'

32:11.166 --> 32:12.417
(Vera)
'Some friend you were.'

32:12.500 --> 32:14.458
When it hit the fan,
you ran for cover.

32:14.542 --> 32:17.166
Zeke never did follow the rules.

32:17.250 --> 32:20.291
I admired that, believe me.

32:20.375 --> 32:23.166
But I...wasn't as
strong as he was.

32:23.250 --> 32:25.250
And couldn't stand
all the neighbors

32:25.333 --> 32:28.041
knowing your dirty
little secret.

32:28.125 --> 32:30.375
What your husband
was doing to the maid?

32:30.458 --> 32:31.959
(Vera)
'So you told Henry
where to find him'

32:32.041 --> 32:33.750
to shut Zeke up for good.

32:33.834 --> 32:36.625
I said those things
to scare Zeke.

32:36.709 --> 32:38.792
To make him go
far away from here.

32:38.875 --> 32:40.333
Why?

32:40.417 --> 32:42.208
Because I knew it was
only a matter of time

32:42.291 --> 32:46.709
before Henry...did something.

32:46.792 --> 32:48.875
So you were
trying to save Zeke.

32:48.959 --> 32:50.792
I owed it to him.

32:50.875 --> 32:53.709
Because in some way,
Zeke saved me.

32:53.792 --> 32:55.375
Yeah? How?

32:55.458 --> 32:59.000
He cared about
what I thought.

32:59.083 --> 33:00.375
There weren't many who did.

33:00.458 --> 33:02.417
Like your husband.

33:02.500 --> 33:05.583
So why did you tell him
where to find Zeke?

33:07.458 --> 33:09.792
I'll regret that
for the rest of my life.

33:11.875 --> 33:14.709
You have no idea.

33:22.417 --> 33:24.917
(Henry)
'Where you been, Judith?'

33:25.000 --> 33:26.500
'I-I, uh..'

33:28.166 --> 33:30.333
I was spending
the night at Marge's.

33:33.291 --> 33:37.166
Billy says a friend of his
at the station house saw
you..

33:37.250 --> 33:39.333
...getting that colored boy out.

33:42.166 --> 33:44.041
I did it for you, Henry.

33:44.125 --> 33:46.208
So you wouldn't go to jail.

33:49.458 --> 33:51.542
You believe that boy's lies.

33:52.542 --> 33:55.166
More than your husband.

33:55.250 --> 33:56.583
'Where is he?'

33:59.417 --> 34:01.834
- You tell me right now.
- Ah.

34:01.917 --> 34:04.625
Or you pack
your bags and get
out.

34:04.709 --> 34:08.208
And you will never
see
your daughter again.

34:08.291 --> 34:09.458
You can't do that.

34:09.542 --> 34:11.041
None of this
would've ever happened

34:11.125 --> 34:13.250
if it wasn't for those people.

34:14.417 --> 34:17.291
Moving in to our neighborhoods.

34:17.375 --> 34:19.500
Takin' a man's livelihood.

34:20.834 --> 34:22.959
His job.

34:23.041 --> 34:25.625
His woman.

34:25.709 --> 34:27.458
'That's why she
got him out, Henry.'

34:27.542 --> 34:29.458
I don't know what you're
talking about, Billy.

34:29.542 --> 34:31.625
You're sleeping with that
colored boy, aren't you?

34:31.709 --> 34:32.667
No!

34:32.750 --> 34:34.750
God! I don't even know him!

34:34.834 --> 34:36.917
(Charlotte)
'Mommy?'

34:40.959 --> 34:42.875
What do you got there, honey?

34:42.959 --> 34:44.125
'Something for Mommy?'

34:44.208 --> 34:47.208
Uh-uh. It's his
winning chess move.

34:47.291 --> 34:49.083
Whose chess move, sweetheart?

34:49.166 --> 34:51.166
Zeke's.

34:57.542 --> 34:59.917
Please don't take her from me.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.542
Where is he?

35:08.583 --> 35:10.458
Headed to Washington.

35:10.542 --> 35:12.583
Please don't take her.

35:14.291 --> 35:15.458
Wanna see your friend,
Zeke, sweetheart?

35:15.542 --> 35:17.959
Henry! What are you doing?

35:18.041 --> 35:19.375
Mommy?

35:30.625 --> 35:32.458
But that piece of paper..

35:32.542 --> 35:34.875
...was found in Zeke's pocket.

35:34.959 --> 35:37.166
Your daughter was there
when Zeke was killed.

35:39.125 --> 35:41.375
That day..

35:41.458 --> 35:45.792
...I lost my one friend
in the world.

35:45.875 --> 35:48.000
I couldn't lose my child, too.

35:50.166 --> 35:54.083
We know
you were there, Charlotte.

35:54.166 --> 35:56.250
When Zeke was killed.

35:58.291 --> 36:00.125
I was in bed, asleep.

36:00.208 --> 36:03.041
You were with your father
and your Uncle Billy

36:03.125 --> 36:05.500
'looking for Zeke.'

36:05.583 --> 36:09.000
You loved your daddy a lot.

36:09.083 --> 36:12.083
Your Uncle Billy, too.

36:12.166 --> 36:14.083
And that's why you never told.

36:15.417 --> 36:17.458
Remember this?

36:18.458 --> 36:21.125
(Rush)
'Zeke's winning move.'

36:21.208 --> 36:23.250
The Ruy Lopez.

36:26.458 --> 36:28.667
He taught it to you.

36:28.750 --> 36:31.458
And you left it with him.

36:31.542 --> 36:33.625
I found it. On his body.

36:35.917 --> 36:38.208
He was left in the middle
of a playground

36:38.291 --> 36:41.333
beaten so badly,
his own mother barely knew him.

36:43.834 --> 36:46.834
I was 12.

36:46.917 --> 36:49.083
(Charlotte)
'I'm sorry.'

36:49.166 --> 36:51.000
It was my fault.

36:51.083 --> 36:53.458
I forgot our chess games
were a secret.

36:57.291 --> 36:59.458
Tell us where your father
took you, Charlotte.

37:06.125 --> 37:08.458
A place in the
woods
I used to play.

37:11.083 --> 37:16.208
My father, he...put
up
a swing for me and..

37:19.625 --> 37:21.667
Show us where.

37:36.750 --> 37:40.959
Zeke was hitch-hiking
on the side of the road.

37:41.041 --> 37:45.834
And my father and...
Uncle Billy and their
friends

37:45.917 --> 37:48.000
they made him get
into the car.

37:52.333 --> 37:54.417
And they brought him here.

38:03.959 --> 38:05.542
Where do you think
you're going now?

38:05.625 --> 38:07.000
Ain't DC.

38:25.208 --> 38:27.417
Shh..

38:27.500 --> 38:29.500
(man on radio )
'We interrupt
our regular broadcast'

38:29.583 --> 38:31.417
'to go live to
the March on Washington.'

38:31.500 --> 38:33.500
Sorry.

38:35.917 --> 38:37.500
(Martin Luther King on radio
)
'I am happy'

38:37.583 --> 38:38.709
'that God is with you today.'

38:41.709 --> 38:47.709
'In what will go down
in history, as we..'

38:47.792 --> 38:49.875
You stay in here.

38:51.083 --> 38:54.333
- 'Hey, don't!'
- 'Cut his legs!'

38:54.417 --> 38:55.709
- Right here! Right here!
- I've got him.

38:55.792 --> 38:57.083
I got him!
I got him!

38:57.166 --> 38:59.000
Okay, right here, Billy.
Right here.

38:59.083 --> 39:00.333
I got him,
I got him, I got him!

39:03.166 --> 39:05.083
'Get him up!
Get him up!'

39:07.709 --> 39:09.834
- 'Got a big mouth, boy.'
- 'Say something!'

39:09.917 --> 39:12.000
(Henry)
'Where you going now, boy? Huh?'

39:12.083 --> 39:13.792
[men laughing]
It ain't DC, boy!

39:13.875 --> 39:16.333
'Gotta learn to shut
that big mouth.'

39:16.417 --> 39:17.667
'Shut that big mouth.'

39:17.750 --> 39:20.709
'Shut that big mouth!
I'm gonna tell now!'

39:20.792 --> 39:25.250
(King on radio)
'...left you battered
by the storms of
persecution.'

39:25.333 --> 39:28.375
'Staggered by the winds
of police brutality.'

39:28.458 --> 39:30.834
[crying]
'You have been...'

39:31.250 --> 39:33.041
Boy!

39:34.166 --> 39:36.250
Come on, come on. One more.

39:36.333 --> 39:38.458
Alright...stop it!

39:42.667 --> 39:45.000
No one's ever going
to hear about this, right?

39:46.333 --> 39:49.792
Especially not your...daddy.

39:49.875 --> 39:51.750
(King on radio)
'Somehow this situation'

39:51.834 --> 39:54.625
'can and will be changed.'

39:54.709 --> 39:57.083
(Zeke)
'You mean..'

39:57.166 --> 39:59.208
...your boss?

40:02.041 --> 40:04.166
[panting]
I'll tell him.

40:05.208 --> 40:07.291
I'll tell everyone.

40:08.709 --> 40:10.875
'What you did to me.'

40:10.959 --> 40:12.583
To Mathilde.

40:14.959 --> 40:17.000
You can't stop me.

40:22.166 --> 40:24.333
Yes, I can.

40:24.417 --> 40:25.583
Billy.

40:25.667 --> 40:28.542
Enough's enough.

40:28.625 --> 40:31.041
(King on radio)
'I have a dream.'

40:31.125 --> 40:33.417
'That one day'

40:33.500 --> 40:36.667
'this nation will rise up'

40:36.750 --> 40:40.208
'and live out
the true meaning of its
creed.'

40:40.291 --> 40:43.000
'We hold these truths
to be self-evident.'

40:43.083 --> 40:44.333
Daddy!

40:44.417 --> 40:46.000
You don't want your daddy
to go to jail.

40:46.083 --> 40:47.083
Do you, Charlotte?

40:49.875 --> 40:52.208
(King)
'I have a dream'

40:52.291 --> 40:55.834
'that my four little children'

40:55.917 --> 40:57.500
'one day, live in a nation'

40:57.583 --> 41:00.542
'where they will not be
judged
by the color of their skin'

41:00.625 --> 41:03.041
'but by the content
of their character.'

41:03.125 --> 41:06.375
'I have a dream today.'

41:06.458 --> 41:09.417
'With this faith, we will
be able to work together'

41:09.500 --> 41:12.166
'to pray together,
to struggle together'

41:12.250 --> 41:16.125
'to go to jail together, to
stand up for freedom together'

41:16.208 --> 41:20.875
'knowing that
we will be free one day.'

41:20.959 --> 41:22.291
'This will be the day...'

41:22.375 --> 41:23.417
Don't look.

41:23.500 --> 41:25.208
Why, Daddy?

41:25.291 --> 41:26.875
'...be able to sing
with new meaning..'

41:26.959 --> 41:30.041
Please, don't look, baby.

41:30.125 --> 41:32.583
"...sweet land of liberty,
of thee I sing."

41:44.333 --> 41:47.709
(King on radio)
'When we allow, freedom
rings!'

41:47.792 --> 41:51.250
'When we let it ring from
every village and every
hamlet'

41:51.333 --> 41:54.917
'from every state
and every city.'

41:55.000 --> 41:57.709
'We will be able
to speed up that day'

41:57.792 --> 42:01.750
'when all of God's children,
black men and white men'

42:01.834 --> 42:05.375
'Jews and gentiles,
Protestants and Catholics'

42:05.458 --> 42:07.375
'will be able to join hands'

42:07.458 --> 42:10.792
'and sing in the words
of the old Negro spiritual'

42:10.875 --> 42:13.458
'"Free at last, Free at last'

42:13.542 --> 42:16.250
'Thank God Almighty,
we are free at last!"'
