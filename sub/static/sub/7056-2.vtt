00:01.468 --> 00:02.852
The original fringe team
didn't vanish.

00:02.887 --> 00:04.220
They aren't missing.

00:04.271 --> 00:05.555
You're right.
They're in Amber.

00:05.606 --> 00:06.939
Previously, on <i>Fringe...</i>

00:10.006 --> 00:11.423
Olivia!

00:11.457 --> 00:13.442
Olivia, breathe.

00:13.517 --> 00:15.968
You're in the year 2036.

00:16.018 --> 00:17.753
I want you to meet Etta.

00:17.771 --> 00:19.755
Hi, mama.

00:22.759 --> 00:25.595
Where's Walter?

00:25.629 --> 00:26.929
Don't move!

00:26.947 --> 00:29.865
Who freed you and your team
from the Amber?

00:31.034 --> 00:33.903
What plan...

00:33.937 --> 00:35.571
To defeat us?

00:35.605 --> 00:39.241
Air control malfunction.

00:41.128 --> 00:42.295
Walter!

00:42.329 --> 00:45.047
Walter, do you
recognize this?

00:45.082 --> 00:46.299
It's meant to collect
and make sense

00:46.333 --> 00:48.250
of the scrambled plan
in your mind.

00:48.284 --> 00:50.886
What plan?

00:55.759 --> 00:59.261
<i>You know, I think that</i>
<i>I would be happy</i>

00:59.295 --> 01:00.930
<i>to stay here</i>

01:00.964 --> 01:02.732
for the rest
of my life.

01:08.271 --> 01:10.472
We should probably
get her home soon,

01:10.490 --> 01:12.975
get her into a bath,

01:12.993 --> 01:14.522
which is never easy.

01:14.523 --> 01:15.690
I nominate you
for that one.

01:15.708 --> 01:17.575
Etta.

01:17.626 --> 01:21.746
<i>Come on, kiddo.</i>
<i>It's time to go home.</i>

01:26.385 --> 01:28.369
<i>Come on!</i>

01:28.387 --> 01:31.005
<i>Stay in the car, right now!</i>

01:31.039 --> 01:32.057
<i>We gotta go--grab her!</i>

01:32.091 --> 01:34.392
<i>Hurry! Come on!</i>
<i>Hurry!</i>

01:34.427 --> 01:35.427
<i>Grab her for me!</i>

01:35.478 --> 01:37.545
<i>Etta!</i>

01:37.563 --> 01:40.148
<i>Etta, come here now!</i>

01:40.182 --> 01:42.067
<i>- I got her!</i>
<i>-  Over there!</i>

What happened?

01:54.730 --> 01:55.780
You were caught in a blast.

01:55.831 --> 01:58.399
<i>You're safe now.</i>

01:58.417 --> 02:00.118
<i>She was a...</i>
<i>little girl.</i>

02:00.169 --> 02:02.587
Peter?
I'm sorry. No children were brought in.

02:02.621 --> 02:04.038
<i>That can't be right.</i>

02:04.072 --> 02:05.423
<i>She was standing</i>
<i>right in front of me.</i>

02:05.458 --> 02:08.042
People are lost
all over the city.

02:08.076 --> 02:10.345
She's around here someplace.
Where are they taking the kids?

02:10.378 --> 02:12.747
<i>Etta! Etta!</i>
Peter!

02:19.220 --> 02:22.356
You're okay.

02:25.576 --> 02:28.495
You were dreaming
about her?

02:28.529 --> 02:32.332
You said her name.

02:33.309 --> 02:35.644
I'm still trembling.

02:35.695 --> 02:40.032
For us, it's like it all just
happened a couple of months ago.

02:40.066 --> 02:41.733
But it didn't.

02:44.404 --> 02:48.407
She's here,
and we're here.

02:48.441 --> 02:50.542
We're okay now.

03:29.582 --> 03:31.316
Good morning.

03:31.334 --> 03:32.451
Not for Walter.

03:32.485 --> 03:33.669
Something's wrong.

03:33.703 --> 03:34.920
Why?
What's up?

03:34.954 --> 03:36.088
Not the thing working

03:36.122 --> 03:37.205
can't it's not.

03:37.256 --> 03:38.423
The Thought Unifier's

03:38.458 --> 03:39.508
having adverse effects.

03:39.542 --> 03:41.176
He's talking
out of sequence.

03:41.210 --> 03:44.329
Two hours ago
the Christmas tree Macy's sale

03:44.347 --> 03:46.264
to have a nap.
Get that thing off of him.

03:46.299 --> 03:48.166
Okay.

03:50.169 --> 03:51.970
I'm not an amateur, Peter.

03:52.004 --> 03:54.723
I need this contraption
if I am to retrieve

03:54.774 --> 03:56.942
the plan to defeat
the Observers

03:56.976 --> 03:58.676
from the depths
of my memory.

03:58.695 --> 04:00.479
We don't know if there's
anything left to retrieve,

04:00.513 --> 04:02.514
and we don't know
what that thing is doing to you.

04:12.024 --> 04:13.291
Swedish?

04:13.326 --> 04:16.128
He was speaking Portuguese
earlier.

04:16.161 --> 04:18.079
Good morning.

04:18.130 --> 04:20.665
I hope the floor
wasn't too bad.

04:20.699 --> 04:24.035
Oh, no, I slept well.
Thank you.

04:24.053 --> 04:26.755
Thanks.

04:28.874 --> 04:29.841
So how's it coming?

04:29.875 --> 04:31.476
So far we know that,

04:31.511 --> 04:33.095
at some point in the past,
Walter knew

04:33.146 --> 04:34.563
both Portuguese
and Swedish.

04:34.597 --> 04:37.649
<i>Other than that,</i>
<i>nothing.</i>

04:40.219 --> 04:44.156
Walter,
you've always documented things.

04:44.190 --> 04:45.907
So are you absolutely sure

04:45.942 --> 04:49.077
that you didn't write
anything down?

04:49.112 --> 04:51.563
I can't remember,
but anything's possible.

04:51.597 --> 04:53.665
Even if there were files,

04:53.699 --> 04:54.833
you can't go back
to Harvard.

04:54.867 --> 04:56.051
We can't get in.

04:56.085 --> 04:58.236
Why not?

04:58.254 --> 05:02.174
It was taken over
by Observers five years ago.

05:02.208 --> 05:05.961
Some kind of base or...
No one knows exactly.

05:06.012 --> 05:08.380
The entire four-mile radius
is a no-go zone.

05:08.414 --> 05:10.248
What's wrong?
Why can't we get into Harvard?

05:10.266 --> 05:12.234
It's been taken over
by Observers, Walter.

05:12.268 --> 05:15.420
Well, that's not a problem
for someone

05:15.455 --> 05:18.356
who's done acid.

05:18.391 --> 05:19.924
So are these barriers

05:19.942 --> 05:21.777
<i>around Walter's lab</i>
<i>checkpoints?</i>

05:21.811 --> 05:23.928
Yeah. No one gets in
without paperwork.

05:23.946 --> 05:25.363
Tunnels.

05:25.398 --> 05:27.566
We don't have time
to dig tunnels, Walter,

05:27.600 --> 05:28.933
or the manpower.

05:28.951 --> 05:30.101
We don't have to dig them.

05:30.119 --> 05:32.287
They're already there.

05:32.321 --> 05:34.105
Steam tunnels.

05:36.876 --> 05:39.544
Right beneath us,
2 1/4 miles

05:39.579 --> 05:41.779
of tunnels that house
the steam pipes

05:41.798 --> 05:43.582
that heat Harvard.

05:43.616 --> 05:45.917
They stretch from the Cambridge
Electric Company plant

05:45.951 --> 05:48.786
on Western Avenue,
to Soldiers Field,

05:48.805 --> 05:50.288
to the law school,
to the science labs.

05:50.306 --> 05:52.557
<i>They made sure the entrances</i>
<i>were well-hidden.</i>

05:52.592 --> 05:55.844
<i>Few have seen</i>
<i>the mysterious passageways.</i>

05:58.848 --> 06:01.766

usually hovers

Hey.
I've been looking for you.

07:09.933 --> 07:11.934
This way.

07:54.595 --> 07:56.345
Oh, my.

08:00.234 --> 08:02.551
I must have ambered it.

08:03.654 --> 08:05.387
Why?

08:05.406 --> 08:08.324
To protect it,
I imagine.

08:20.087 --> 08:22.255
What is it?

08:22.289 --> 08:24.123
<i>It's my Betamax recorder</i>

08:24.158 --> 08:26.575
<i>on a tripod.</i>

08:27.693 --> 08:30.362
Look where it's standing.

08:30.396 --> 08:35.116
<i>Look at the blast pattern.</i>

08:35.217 --> 08:37.335
This is the amber point
of origin.

08:37.385 --> 08:39.837
I must have been standing
right here

08:39.888 --> 08:42.789
when I ambered
this lab.

08:44.626 --> 08:46.510
I don't think
I wrote anything down.

08:46.545 --> 08:48.962
I think I was making
a video.

08:48.981 --> 08:51.232
<i>The question is,</i>

08:51.266 --> 08:52.850
<i>is the tape still in there?</i>

08:52.901 --> 08:56.404
There's only one way
to find out.

08:57.939 --> 09:01.242
When did I switch to grape?

09:15.791 --> 09:18.959
On your knees.

09:18.993 --> 09:20.661
<i>Who are you people?</i>

09:22.047 --> 09:24.164
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

09:24.182 --> 09:25.683
<i>He's a loyalist.</i>

09:25.717 --> 09:28.335
<i>He's not gonna tell us</i>
<i>anything.</i>

09:40.532 --> 09:42.683
Gael Manfretti.

09:43.952 --> 09:46.120
Nothing but bread crumbs.

09:46.154 --> 09:49.206
Baldies feed you well,
Gael?

09:49.241 --> 09:51.402
<i>Maybe this was part</i>
<i>of his patrol.</i>

09:51.404 --> 09:52.655
Why would he have come here?

09:52.706 --> 09:54.123
I mean,
the place is abandoned.

09:54.157 --> 09:56.108
For all we know,
we tripped some silent alarm.

09:56.126 --> 09:57.826
Either way, someone's
gonna notice him missing

09:57.877 --> 09:59.244
sooner or later.

09:59.278 --> 10:00.445
We need to stay.

10:00.463 --> 10:02.131
If that camera's the key

10:02.165 --> 10:04.900
<i>to helping Walter remember,</i>
<i>we have to get it.</i>

10:09.255 --> 10:11.006
I need the laser.

10:11.057 --> 10:12.174
<i>What about the device I used</i>

10:12.225 --> 10:13.592
<i>to free you with?</i>

10:13.626 --> 10:14.626
No, it won't work.

10:14.644 --> 10:16.095
The amber's too thick.

10:16.129 --> 10:17.296
It'll probably push
the camera further in.

10:17.330 --> 10:18.564
I need a proper laser.

10:18.598 --> 10:20.849
Well, Walter,
could you make one?

10:20.900 --> 10:23.686
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

10:25.271 --> 10:27.906
There's no power.
At all.

10:27.941 --> 10:30.642
All the ambering
must have blown everything.

10:30.660 --> 10:32.144
Yeah, Walter, I think it's blown
all the way

10:32.162 --> 10:33.796
back to the campus substation.

10:33.830 --> 10:35.647
Well, a laser needs power,
Peter.

10:35.665 --> 10:37.983
The substation's in the basement
of the Science building.

10:38.001 --> 10:39.485
That's the only way
we're gonna get power.

10:39.519 --> 10:41.537
We can get there
using the tunnels.

10:41.588 --> 10:42.821
Well, wait a minute.
We don't even know

10:42.839 --> 10:44.156
if it's the Science building
anymore.

10:44.174 --> 10:46.125
We have no idea
what's in there

10:46.159 --> 10:48.627
<i>or what could be waiting</i>
<i>for us.</i>

10:48.661 --> 10:51.380
We don't.
But he does.

10:56.002 --> 10:59.638
I'm sure
he knows plenty.

11:03.693 --> 11:05.894
You don't seem
to talk much.

11:05.945 --> 11:08.530
I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

11:08.565 --> 11:10.899
What do you know
about the Science building?

11:13.036 --> 11:15.537
You're a real open book.

11:21.194 --> 11:25.080
It's okay.
I'm good at opening books.

11:27.917 --> 11:31.036
Where did you get that?

11:33.973 --> 11:37.259
It's not important.

11:37.310 --> 11:40.145
What's important

11:40.180 --> 11:43.098
is that I have it.

11:54.727 --> 11:57.029
What do they use
the Science building for?

12:34.994 --> 12:38.580
Criterion collection,
forgive me.

12:42.135 --> 12:44.119
Walter,
it's just a laser disc player.

12:44.137 --> 12:47.839
We need the laser.

12:47.890 --> 12:50.725
Peter.
<i>No, no.</i>

12:50.760 --> 12:54.846
No, it should be me.

13:03.272 --> 13:06.024
Walter, I don't think
this laser disc tube

13:06.075 --> 13:07.776
can generate enough power.

13:07.810 --> 13:10.495
<i>We need a better gain ratio.</i>

13:12.148 --> 13:13.982
Flying vermin.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.500
You'd think
after 21 years

13:15.535 --> 13:16.651
the Observers would have found

13:16.669 --> 13:18.336
to rid
of them first.

13:18.371 --> 13:21.623
<i>Or at least found a use</i>
<i>for them.</i>

13:21.657 --> 13:23.792
Maybe freeze-dry them
and hand them out

13:23.826 --> 13:26.795
to the poor
as sustenance.

13:26.829 --> 13:28.547
We're gonna need
a helium-neon mix.

13:28.598 --> 13:29.848
There should be one
or two canisters...

13:29.882 --> 13:31.683
In the storage room
off my office.

13:31.717 --> 13:33.501
I'll get them.

13:42.445 --> 13:44.729
<i>I'm gonna ask you again.</i>

13:44.780 --> 13:47.799
What do we need to know
about the Science building?

13:49.902 --> 13:52.654
Etta?

13:54.574 --> 13:56.341
<i>What are you doing?</i>

13:56.375 --> 13:58.043
It's called an Angel device.

13:58.077 --> 14:00.712
It stirs up and destabilizes
every atom in his body.

14:00.746 --> 14:04.132
<i>Full-charge</i>
<i>steals around 25, 30 years.</i>

14:04.167 --> 14:07.169
But this is a long way
from a full charge.

14:09.222 --> 14:11.339
He's so disorientated
by the process

14:11.373 --> 14:13.058
he loses the will
to lie.

14:13.092 --> 14:14.709
<i>Or he holds out</i>
<i>until his heart fails.</i>

14:14.710 --> 14:17.156
But most of them give us
what we need to know.

14:18.153 --> 14:20.153
And if they don't?

14:21.901 --> 14:23.885
What are you doing?
I'm giving him water.

14:23.903 --> 14:25.820
You want to kill him,
go ahead.

14:25.855 --> 14:27.105
That's how you'll do it.

14:27.156 --> 14:28.389
He can't have water yet.

14:28.407 --> 14:30.442
Not for another three hours.

14:34.730 --> 14:37.899
He's not worth
a single tear.

14:45.841 --> 14:48.743
Loyalists sell out
their own kind like rats.

14:48.761 --> 14:52.097
I know you just woke up,

14:52.131 --> 14:53.932
but look around you, Mom.

14:53.966 --> 14:56.017
Can't you see
what the Observers have brought?

14:56.052 --> 14:58.753
This is war...

14:58.771 --> 15:01.856
and we're losing.

15:01.891 --> 15:04.309
<i>Etta!</i>

15:04.360 --> 15:06.311
I'll be right back.

15:06.362 --> 15:09.898
Just don't get too near him.

15:21.577 --> 15:24.713
<i>Walter, what's up?</i>

15:26.615 --> 15:27.782
Don't you wear
a necklace?

15:27.800 --> 15:30.051
The clasp was loose.

15:30.086 --> 15:32.837
I took it off
to try to fix it. Why?

15:32.888 --> 15:34.956
Then you won't mind
me melting it down.

15:34.974 --> 15:38.760
Don't worry. We just need
the silver for solder.

15:44.934 --> 15:46.768
Thank you.

15:55.244 --> 15:56.861
How do I look?

15:56.912 --> 15:59.631
Like you're in pain.

16:01.867 --> 16:04.619
<i>You know, my absence</i>
<i>won't go unnoticed.</i>

16:04.653 --> 16:07.989
I don't believe that anybody's
coming to look for you.

16:10.259 --> 16:12.294
See, I don't think
that you're here

16:12.328 --> 16:14.763
because we were seen
or because we triggered

16:14.797 --> 16:16.181
some sort of alert.

16:16.215 --> 16:21.502
I think
that you came here

16:21.520 --> 16:23.471
to feed the birds.

16:29.895 --> 16:32.447
Look, I'm guessing you're
probably not even supposed

16:32.481 --> 16:33.782
to be in this building,

16:33.816 --> 16:35.317
so even if you are missed,

16:35.351 --> 16:40.322
this would be the last place
anybody would look.

16:40.356 --> 16:44.326
You need to tell her
what she wants to know now.

16:44.360 --> 16:47.379
You need to tell her
before you get worse.

16:47.413 --> 16:50.698
You've already lost years
of your life.

16:50.716 --> 16:54.336
Now come on. You must have
something to live for.

16:56.389 --> 16:58.173
I'm trying
to help you.

16:58.207 --> 16:59.808
You don't have the authority
to do that.

16:59.842 --> 17:01.393
Do you?

17:01.427 --> 17:03.478
Well, what authority
do I need?

17:03.512 --> 17:05.096
You know a loyalist
just doesn't walk away

17:05.146 --> 17:06.931
when they've been captured
by the resistance.

17:06.982 --> 17:09.017
How can you be so sure?

17:12.355 --> 17:14.888
Where are you from?

17:14.906 --> 17:16.858
Why?

17:16.892 --> 17:18.777
You're new
to the resistance.

17:21.280 --> 17:24.249
I've been around a lot longer
than you may think.

17:33.843 --> 17:37.462
Look...

17:37.513 --> 17:39.547
I'm not gonna survive this.

17:39.581 --> 17:41.716
And I'm not afraid
to die,

17:41.750 --> 17:45.053
so I will tell her
what she needs to know

17:45.087 --> 17:50.692
if you will go
and tell my son

17:50.726 --> 17:54.195
I'm not coming home...

17:54.230 --> 17:57.932
and that I loved him
very much.

17:57.950 --> 18:01.769
I don't want him
to keep looking for me.

18:01.787 --> 18:06.574
I don't want him
hoping he'll see me again.

18:06.608 --> 18:09.661
I've seen that too many times,
people waiting for people

18:09.712 --> 18:14.115
who never come home.

18:36.522 --> 18:39.640
Everyone has an access code.

18:39.658 --> 18:41.642
<i>You can't get in</i>
<i>without one.</i>

18:41.660 --> 18:43.811
And what's in the building?

18:43.829 --> 18:45.480
The main power grid
is still there.

18:45.498 --> 18:47.749
Other than that,
I don't know.

18:47.783 --> 18:50.835
I don't go
below the first floor.

18:50.870 --> 18:53.288
We don't ask.
Rumors mainly.

18:53.322 --> 18:55.457
What kind of rumors?
Experiments.

18:55.491 --> 18:57.709
On what?

18:57.760 --> 18:59.794
On everything.

19:02.381 --> 19:05.166
My access code

19:05.184 --> 19:06.968
is a two-part code.

19:07.002 --> 19:12.173
The first part
is 010567.

19:12.191 --> 19:13.808
And the second part?

19:15.293 --> 19:18.296
Me.

19:20.065 --> 19:23.318
Can we beat
an ocular scanner?

19:23.352 --> 19:25.703
We have his code
to access the building,

19:25.738 --> 19:27.739
but there are scanners
at every point.

19:27.790 --> 19:31.743
<i>Well, that didn't take long.</i>

19:33.796 --> 19:36.864
What's wrong?

19:36.882 --> 19:40.585
<i>Where did this come from?</i>

19:40.636 --> 19:41.702
Barbaric.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.704
What has the world come to?

19:43.722 --> 19:47.675
<i>How could the resistance</i>
<i>create such a device?</i>

19:47.710 --> 19:50.011
We didn't.
The loyalists did.

19:50.045 --> 19:52.013
It's old second-gen
Observer tech.

19:52.047 --> 19:54.649
It was designed to prepare
Observers for time travel.

19:54.683 --> 19:57.185
But, as you can see,
the loyalists figured out

19:57.219 --> 19:59.437
a new way to use it
on us.

19:59.488 --> 20:02.156
<i>No reason we shouldn't use it</i>
<i>on them.</i>

20:13.452 --> 20:14.536
It's just a transport truck.

20:14.570 --> 20:18.373
<i>We're okay.</i>

20:18.407 --> 20:24.078
Well, as far
as ocular scanners go,

20:24.096 --> 20:26.014
the only surefire way
is to bring him with you.

20:26.048 --> 20:27.915
It's impossible.
Look at him.

20:29.969 --> 20:34.889
I'm gonna look
at your eye.

20:40.262 --> 20:41.980
And, if you can't bring him
with you,

20:42.031 --> 20:44.115
there's only one way.
I agree.

20:44.149 --> 20:45.766
Walter, you can't.

20:45.784 --> 20:47.435
Of course I can.

20:48.770 --> 20:50.405
Rather easily
in fact.

20:50.439 --> 20:54.576
Astril, I'm gonna need
a sharp scalpel

20:54.610 --> 20:57.612
and my long-handled
stainless spoon.

21:12.237 --> 21:16.774
I'll need another.

21:16.808 --> 21:18.860
<i>Pay attention</i>
<i>to the texture.</i>

21:18.911 --> 21:21.913
<i>Make sure it's spongy.</i>

21:21.947 --> 21:24.198
<i>You know, the Vietnamese</i>
<i>consider pigs' eyes</i>

21:24.249 --> 21:26.150
to be a delicacy.

21:26.168 --> 21:28.469
Even ones that have been sitting
in formaldehyde

21:28.504 --> 21:30.672
for 20 years?

21:35.844 --> 21:37.328
Yes, that should do nicely.

21:37.363 --> 21:38.680
Are you sure
this will work, Walter?

21:38.714 --> 21:41.132
"In a pig's eye."

21:41.166 --> 21:42.550
I wonder what the origin
of that term--

21:42.601 --> 21:44.635
Walter.

21:44.669 --> 21:47.472
Certainly. An iris
is like a fingerprint.

21:47.506 --> 21:49.273
Each has
its own unique pattern.

21:49.308 --> 21:52.009
And, if we can mimic
that pattern,

21:52.027 --> 21:53.361
we can trick the scanner

21:53.395 --> 21:55.846
into thinking
that this pig's eye

21:55.864 --> 22:00.151
is our tattooed friend there.

22:01.870 --> 22:05.907
The world has changed
so much.

22:05.958 --> 22:09.527
It can be difficult
to understand it.

22:14.133 --> 22:17.268
I'm not sure I want
to understand it.

22:27.146 --> 22:28.179
Not bad.

22:28.213 --> 22:29.263
Yeah?

22:29.314 --> 22:30.598
You're next.

22:30.649 --> 22:32.150
How's he doing?

22:32.184 --> 22:34.185
He's getting there.

22:44.113 --> 22:47.331
Thank you.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.567
For what?

22:49.585 --> 22:51.969
When I said it was logical
for me

22:52.004 --> 22:54.172
to go turn the power on
instead of you.

22:54.206 --> 22:57.241
That I know protocol
if something goes off track

22:57.259 --> 22:59.410
and that Peter should go
because he's the engineer.

23:01.780 --> 23:05.349
I appreciate
you respecting my experience.

23:05.384 --> 23:08.302
'Cause I know
you'd rather it be you.

23:10.806 --> 23:14.075
I know you like
to be in control.

23:14.109 --> 23:17.261
So do I.

23:30.108 --> 23:32.776
I did my best,
but it has to be exact.

23:34.046 --> 23:35.797
Well, is this exact?

23:35.831 --> 23:39.517
We'll find out.

24:01.139 --> 24:03.191
Gentlemen.

24:15.787 --> 24:20.491
Why does someone
join the loyalists?

24:20.509 --> 24:24.795
Pain.

24:30.269 --> 24:34.338
There were resistance fighters

24:34.356 --> 24:36.023
near my building.

24:36.058 --> 24:38.643
They were gonna blow up
a city bus

24:38.677 --> 24:41.646
full of them.
Invaders.

24:41.680 --> 24:44.565
My children
were outside.

24:44.616 --> 24:47.401
One of them
was killed.

24:47.452 --> 24:50.371
My oldest boy.

24:50.405 --> 24:53.574
I'm sorry.

24:53.625 --> 24:57.495
I know something
about losing a child.

24:59.831 --> 25:03.668
So,
after that moment,

25:03.702 --> 25:07.088
I just wanted
to be safe.

25:07.139 --> 25:10.708
You know, I was angry
at the resistance

25:10.726 --> 25:12.710
because...

25:12.728 --> 25:17.047
it's hopeless.

25:17.065 --> 25:19.049
So I do this job.

25:20.819 --> 25:23.387
They give us
a safe place to live,

25:23.405 --> 25:25.773
get taken care of,
they look after us.

25:25.824 --> 25:30.695
And I don't have
to worry,

25:30.729 --> 25:32.697
at least about my boy.

25:36.034 --> 25:39.370
I'll never understand
you people.

25:39.404 --> 25:42.072
You can't win.

25:42.090 --> 25:44.342
The world would be
a much safer place

25:44.376 --> 25:48.095
if you just stopped trying
to fight them.

26:12.871 --> 26:15.990
What's Manfretti doing
in building four?

26:16.024 --> 26:17.908
<i>That's not his sector.</i>

26:17.942 --> 26:21.412
Manfretti,
come in, over.

26:25.784 --> 26:27.301
<i>Manfretti?</i>

26:27.336 --> 26:30.388
Answer it.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.473
We had an agreement.

26:32.507 --> 26:35.059
Now answer it.

26:35.093 --> 26:38.962
Hey, there.
What's up?

26:38.981 --> 26:41.182
The hell you doing accessing
the Medical Science wing?

26:41.233 --> 26:43.517
<i>You're supposed to be</i>
<i>in sector seven.</i>

26:43.568 --> 26:46.320
Tell them that you needed
to change a fuse.

26:46.355 --> 26:48.689
A fuse blew.

26:48.740 --> 26:50.107
I went to fix it.

26:50.141 --> 26:53.110
Since when does security
change fuses?

26:53.144 --> 26:56.146
<i>Who asked you to do that?</i>

27:06.157 --> 27:08.959
Number 19.

27:11.013 --> 27:12.680
Big guy 19,
really?

27:12.714 --> 27:15.833
Yeah.
Really.

27:18.854 --> 27:20.221
<i>Change your stupid fuse</i>

27:20.272 --> 27:23.057
<i>and get back</i>
<i>to your post.</i>

27:41.025 --> 27:43.744
You knew
if they went to that area

27:43.795 --> 27:44.862
they wouldn't be cleared.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.414
No, I didn't.

27:46.465 --> 27:51.585
I've never been anywhere
I wasn't supposed to be.

28:10.655 --> 28:14.425
<i>Simon.</i>

28:28.957 --> 28:31.208
Etta?

28:31.242 --> 28:33.594
Etta, no, no,
stop, stop.

28:33.628 --> 28:35.963
What are you doing?
We have to keep on moving.

28:36.014 --> 28:38.048
Think of the tape.
Think about what's on it.

28:38.082 --> 28:39.683
Think about your future.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.585
There will be a time
for vengeance

28:41.603 --> 28:42.970
and a time for grieving,
but it is not now.

28:43.021 --> 28:45.589
Stop.
Stop.

28:51.897 --> 28:54.899
They'll pay
for what they've done.

28:54.933 --> 28:58.068
I promise.

29:07.974 --> 29:11.060
<i>Do you really think</i>
<i>you can win?</i>

29:17.450 --> 29:22.738
Well, we have to win.

29:22.789 --> 29:26.525
So that all the people
that died, including your son,

29:26.543 --> 29:28.827
didn't die for nothing.

29:51.684 --> 29:54.386
Now.

29:57.157 --> 29:58.723
Let there be light.

29:58.742 --> 30:01.076
<i>Walter, we have</i>
<i>to turn them off</i>

30:01.111 --> 30:03.061
or someone could see us.

30:03.079 --> 30:06.749
Wait.
Let's see if this still works.

30:06.783 --> 30:09.201
Yes.

30:11.904 --> 30:14.206
You ready?
Yeah.

30:28.805 --> 30:30.139
Invigorating.

30:30.190 --> 30:32.474
You want a go?

30:59.202 --> 31:01.837
Peter?

31:01.888 --> 31:05.290
What happened?

31:15.151 --> 31:17.436
<i>Etta.</i>

31:17.470 --> 31:21.857
I'm really sorry
about Agent Foster.

31:21.908 --> 31:24.576
Freedom has its costs.

31:24.611 --> 31:26.028
Simon knew that.
Get up.

31:26.079 --> 31:28.647
You're traveling.

31:36.005 --> 31:37.706
Where are you taking him?

31:37.757 --> 31:39.658
He's useless
to us now.

31:39.676 --> 31:41.159
I'm turning him over
to the resistance.

31:41.177 --> 31:44.546
<i>He says</i>
<i>no one ever comes back.</i>

31:44.597 --> 31:46.164
And resistance fighters
don't come back

31:46.182 --> 31:48.300
when they're taken in
by loyalists.

31:48.334 --> 31:50.102
HQ will get whatever else
they can from him

31:50.136 --> 31:52.271
<i>and dispose of him,</i>
<i>and the world will be</i>

31:52.305 --> 31:54.122
<i>a tiny bit safer.</i>

31:54.157 --> 31:55.674
<i>Look, I know</i>
<i>you're upset right now,</i>

31:55.708 --> 31:57.893
<i>but he did give us</i>
<i>the code.</i>

31:57.944 --> 31:58.894
Yeah, of course he did.

31:58.945 --> 32:00.345
It's natural human instinct.

32:00.363 --> 32:03.848
To live as long
as possible.

32:03.867 --> 32:06.285
It's the same quality
they use

32:06.319 --> 32:08.353
to turn us
into slaves.

32:08.371 --> 32:11.856
He joined them
in order to protect

32:11.875 --> 32:14.243
what was left of his family,
you know, his son.

32:14.294 --> 32:15.711
He's a liar.

32:15.745 --> 32:18.247
<i>That's what they're trained</i>
<i>to do.</i>

32:18.298 --> 32:20.799
He has no son.

32:20.833 --> 32:24.136
He gave you the code because he
saw in your eyes a weakness.

32:24.170 --> 32:27.472
He saw in your eyes
that you could be manipulated,

32:27.507 --> 32:31.894
that maybe, maybe he could
convince you to let him go.

32:35.431 --> 32:38.049
But that's not gonna happen,
sweetheart.

32:42.822 --> 32:44.239
Etta,

32:44.274 --> 32:45.774
<i>I understand</i>
<i>how hurt you must be.</i>

32:45.825 --> 32:48.577
You don't know my world.

32:56.786 --> 32:59.538
You're right.

32:59.572 --> 33:01.906
I don't know
your world.

33:04.093 --> 33:06.795
But I had hoped
for you that,

33:06.846 --> 33:08.747
wherever you were,

33:08.765 --> 33:11.967
you weren't hardened
by what had happened to you.

33:14.771 --> 33:16.888
And it's not that I don't see

33:16.922 --> 33:20.192
what the Observers
have brought, I do.

33:20.226 --> 33:22.027
But what concerns me more

33:22.061 --> 33:25.113
is what they've taken away.

33:29.101 --> 33:30.619
This is the world.

33:30.653 --> 33:33.772
It is what it is.

33:35.625 --> 33:37.492
Don't move.

33:48.221 --> 33:50.839
143 Dunstable Street.

33:50.890 --> 33:54.660
Number seven.

33:54.694 --> 34:00.015
His name is Oscar.

34:07.190 --> 34:09.274
I keep my word.

34:09.308 --> 34:12.610
I know you do.

34:20.036 --> 34:22.788
Walter.

34:22.822 --> 34:25.824
I need a sedative.

34:25.842 --> 34:28.844
That can be arranged.

34:35.018 --> 34:36.501
That's a comm device.

34:36.518 --> 34:38.637
If Walter needs anything else
for the laser,

34:38.670 --> 34:41.306
I'll be able
to get it for him.

35:02.712 --> 35:04.880
There you are.

35:50.128 --> 35:53.797
You don't have a son,
do you?

35:56.117 --> 35:58.302
No.

36:03.758 --> 36:07.961
I was hoping,
right up until the last minute,

36:07.979 --> 36:11.515
that she could somehow
convince you.

36:15.937 --> 36:20.107
You were right about me.

36:21.910 --> 36:26.497
I became a loyalist

36:26.531 --> 36:29.666
because I'm a coward.

36:38.459 --> 36:40.844
Get out of here.

37:10.191 --> 37:13.377
I'm gonna fight.

37:13.411 --> 37:15.546
For the resistance.
I want you to know that.

37:15.580 --> 37:17.881
You don't have
to lie anymore.

37:17.916 --> 37:18.999
I already let you go.

37:19.033 --> 37:20.217
Well, that's
why this time

37:20.251 --> 37:24.221
I'm hoping
you believe me.

37:24.255 --> 37:26.089
I mean,
this can come in useful.

37:26.140 --> 37:28.041
There aren't
many resistance fighters

37:28.059 --> 37:30.710
with an active tat I.D.

37:30.728 --> 37:36.716
<i>You said I saw something</i>
<i>in her eyes.</i>

37:36.734 --> 37:40.437
You were right.

37:40.488 --> 37:45.909
There was a certainty

37:45.944 --> 37:47.227
that I've never seen before,

37:47.245 --> 37:49.580
and I don't know
how to explain it

37:49.614 --> 37:53.834
other than to say
I felt...

37:53.868 --> 37:57.421
for the first time

37:57.455 --> 38:00.674
that we were supposed
to win.

38:08.916 --> 38:12.269
Why are you letting me live?

38:16.107 --> 38:21.895
Something that I saw
in her eyes as well.

38:21.929 --> 38:25.148
Pity.

38:25.199 --> 38:28.652
Pity for who?

38:31.873 --> 38:34.458
For all of us.

38:45.637 --> 38:48.755
Got it.

38:52.727 --> 38:54.627
It looks like the heat
from the laser

38:54.646 --> 38:56.680
might have damaged
the PVC.

38:56.731 --> 38:59.182
It might have damaged
the tape.

38:59.233 --> 39:01.601
I told you
we should have gone slower.

39:13.581 --> 39:15.248
Whoever you are,

39:15.283 --> 39:16.816
<i>if you found this tape,</i>

39:16.834 --> 39:20.003
<i>you've retrieved it</i>
<i>from amber.</i>

39:20.038 --> 39:23.006
If you are watching this,
then you know very well

39:23.041 --> 39:24.891
that the Observers
have invaded.

39:24.926 --> 39:27.660
<i>I am most probably dead,</i>

39:27.679 --> 39:30.714
and unfortunately my plan
to stop them has failed.

39:30.748 --> 39:32.883
<i>I have documented</i>
<i>all the parts of the plan</i>

39:32.934 --> 39:34.101
<i>on videotapes.</i>

39:34.135 --> 39:35.852
<i>You must recover each tape</i>

39:35.887 --> 39:38.605
<i>and follow the instructions</i>
<i>on each of those tapes</i>

39:38.639 --> 39:41.608
<i>to retrieve all the parts</i>
<i>of the plan.</i>

39:41.642 --> 39:43.143
Once you do so,

39:43.177 --> 39:45.445
what you need to do
will be clear to you.

39:45.480 --> 39:47.114
If successful,

39:47.148 --> 39:49.483
this plan will restore us

39:49.517 --> 39:53.704
and rid the world
of the Observers.

39:57.658 --> 39:59.376
You were chosen
for this.

39:59.410 --> 40:03.380
<i>This is your destiny.</i>

40:03.414 --> 40:04.748
I understand
if you're frightened.

40:04.799 --> 40:07.534
It will not be easy,
but I trust

40:07.552 --> 40:09.720
that the same will
that brought you here

40:09.754 --> 40:11.755
will keep you going.

40:11.806 --> 40:13.390
It--

40:20.398 --> 40:23.600
<i>Gentle, Peter.</i>

40:49.293 --> 40:52.095
I'm on my way back.

40:56.250 --> 40:59.586
Okay.

40:59.604 --> 41:01.388
<i>Here we go.</i>

41:03.691 --> 41:05.225
But I trust

41:05.259 --> 41:08.195
that the same will
that brought you here

41:08.229 --> 41:10.280
will keep you going.

41:10.314 --> 41:14.151
It is important
that you follow the tapes.

41:14.202 --> 41:19.072
You must begin
this journey right away.

41:19.106 --> 41:22.459
You are humanity's only hope.

41:24.278 --> 41:29.699
<i>Now you must retrieve</i>
<i>the first tape.</i>
