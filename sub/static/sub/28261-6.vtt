Previously on "Pretty Little
Liars, The Perfectionists.."

00:02.544 --> 00:04.546
The images will play
as the models walk

00:04.546 --> 00:05.631
and we'll start with..

00:07.090 --> 00:09.551
How long?
How long was it going on?

00:09.551 --> 00:10.969
You said that
I could tell you anything.

00:10.969 --> 00:12.638
I overestimated myself
and you.

00:12.638 --> 00:14.514
Nothing stays secret forever.

00:14.514 --> 00:17.017
'Something that would destroy
your family got out.'

00:17.017 --> 00:19.436
- I'm looking for answers.
- Someone tried to kill me.

00:19.436 --> 00:21.855
I don't know who it was.
That's why I faked my death.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.899
That person
probably killed my brother.

00:23.899 --> 00:25.567
I'm the rat.
I looked you up on the internet.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.653
'Everything about your family
taking the money.'

00:27.653 --> 00:29.196
Now Mason knows.

00:31.406 --> 00:32.699
(Ava)
Dad?

00:32.699 --> 00:34.159
You are a miserable
human being.

00:34.159 --> 00:35.827
Why, because I read your file?

00:35.827 --> 00:36.912
'Because I know
your dad called you'

00:36.912 --> 00:38.205
'his beautiful dreamer?'

00:40.540 --> 00:42.334
We have to stop Mason
before my fashion show.

00:42.334 --> 00:44.127
A simple plan
is, like, taking his phone

00:44.127 --> 00:45.629
and figuring out
where he was that night.

00:45.629 --> 00:47.506
I need you to lure Mason
to Nolan's cabin

00:47.506 --> 00:50.425
so we can drug him and get
his murder confession on tape.

00:50.425 --> 00:51.969
Got the phone?

00:51.969 --> 00:53.095
[tires screeching]

00:53.095 --> 00:54.221
- Caitlin!
- Ah!

00:55.597 --> 00:58.267
[indistinct chatter]

00:58.267 --> 01:00.727
[sighs]
She's still in surgery.

01:03.397 --> 01:06.275
That's gotta be a bad sign,
right?

01:06.275 --> 01:07.776
I mean, as long as
they still have her in there

01:07.776 --> 01:09.444
they think there's something
they can do.

01:09.444 --> 01:12.322
So you're a half-full
kind of guy?

01:12.322 --> 01:14.574
Hm?

01:14.574 --> 01:17.452
- You're an optimist.
- I'm hopeful, yeah.

01:20.455 --> 01:23.417
Okay, well,
today I will be, too..

01:23.417 --> 01:25.585
...because I can't imagine
losing somebody else.

01:30.424 --> 01:31.633
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

01:31.633 --> 01:32.676
[chuckles]

01:36.138 --> 01:38.432
I just want you to know that

01:38.432 --> 01:42.519
I would have told you...
about Nolan.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.980
I just..

01:44.980 --> 01:46.898
I didn't have the time
to figure out

01:46.898 --> 01:50.277
how to say it
without hurting you.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.737
And I'm really sorry
about what I said

01:51.737 --> 01:53.530
about Andrew in the cabin.

01:56.199 --> 01:59.119
I didn't mean it.
I swear, I just..

01:59.119 --> 02:01.621
I get, I get it.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.874
- I get it.
- Have you heard from him since?

02:05.542 --> 02:07.669
No.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.421
Maybe it's better
this way though.

02:09.421 --> 02:11.757
You know,
I mean, if he's not around

02:11.757 --> 02:14.926
Mason can't mess with him.

02:14.926 --> 02:16.970
I mean, he's trying to find
some silver lining to this

02:16.970 --> 02:18.638
that's all.

02:18.638 --> 02:21.099
Well, it brought us together.

02:21.099 --> 02:24.186
So I guess
that's our sliver lining.

02:24.186 --> 02:27.773
Are we...together?

02:27.773 --> 02:29.775
Caitlin stole Mason's phone
to prove to us

02:29.775 --> 02:31.985
that we could trust her.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.904
So, yeah, we're together.

02:39.034 --> 02:41.036
Hey!

02:41.036 --> 02:42.579
How do I explain Taylor?

02:44.164 --> 02:46.666
You found the dead girl
whose brother was killed

02:46.666 --> 02:49.294
based off a rose you found
in a cabin and a map of Oz.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.797
Then you brought said dead girl
back to Beacon Heights

02:51.797 --> 02:55.217
despite my warnings, only
to have her disappear again?

02:55.217 --> 02:56.885
That seems right.

02:56.885 --> 02:59.763
You know,
when you say it like that..

02:59.763 --> 03:02.557
...I do have a lot
to worry about.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.601
We don't even know
if she's connected to all this.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.819
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:13.819 --> 03:16.279
- Any word?
- She's still in surgery.

03:16.279 --> 03:17.823
What happened?

03:19.449 --> 03:21.701
It's okay. She's one of us.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.870
[scoffs]
I wouldn't go that far.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.581
I've never really been a joiner,
so the whole posse thing's

03:26.581 --> 03:30.252
not a good fit for me.
But can you trust me? Yes.

03:30.252 --> 03:33.046
I wanna know who killed Nolan
just as much as you do.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.214
Oh, we know who killed Nolan--

03:34.214 --> 03:36.675
And tried to do the same
to Caitlin.

03:36.675 --> 03:38.301
Guys, you can trust Mona.

03:40.595 --> 03:43.515
[deep breath]

03:43.515 --> 03:45.725
Okay, it was Mason Gregory.

03:45.725 --> 03:49.271
He was jealous of Nolan
because he was always number one

03:49.271 --> 03:53.275
and when he got rid of him,
Mason spiraled into Nolan 2.0.

03:53.275 --> 03:55.193
Now he's got a hold
of Nolan's stash of secrets

03:55.193 --> 03:57.154
and he's been blackmailing us
to get what he wants.

03:57.154 --> 03:59.781
- Oh, been there, done that.
- Sorry?

03:59.781 --> 04:02.409
Ah, we'll save that
for another time.

04:02.409 --> 04:05.370
(Ava)
'Caitlin stole Mason's phone
last night.'

04:05.370 --> 04:07.247
So we could use it
to prove that he was there.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.582
He was at Thorne Hall

04:08.582 --> 04:10.667
the night that Nolan
was pushed off the roof

04:10.667 --> 04:12.836
and he ran her over as payback.

04:12.836 --> 04:15.380
Ah, a-are we talkin'
about the same Mason?

04:15.380 --> 04:18.800
Mason Gregory
as in model cute Mason?

04:18.800 --> 04:20.719
No, he was with the crew team
last night. He left.

04:20.719 --> 04:23.555
He found time to hit Caitlin
and still make the plane.

04:23.555 --> 04:25.849
Why would you risk everything
and not even talk to me first?

04:25.849 --> 04:27.434
Because we wanted it to be over.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.186
We needed it to be over.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.189
[indistinct chatter
on police radio]

04:35.358 --> 04:37.402
And maybe now it can be.

04:39.946 --> 04:42.699
This is our chance
to tell the cops everything.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.743
The hit and run happened
off campus.

04:44.743 --> 04:47.412
- Out of Dana Booker's reach.
- What do you mean?

04:47.412 --> 04:50.081
I know she suspects you,
but you didn't kill Nolan.

04:50.081 --> 04:51.875
- So why not just--
- Trust her?

04:51.875 --> 04:53.502
How much time do you have?

04:54.753 --> 04:56.171
Are you in?

04:56.171 --> 04:58.798
My secrets are already
out there. It's your call.

04:58.798 --> 05:01.218
You lie for us.
Are you okay with this?

05:01.218 --> 05:03.929
- They're your secrets.
- We owe it to Caitlin.

05:05.555 --> 05:06.890
Let's go.

05:10.101 --> 05:11.978
Well, I never
would have done that.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.980
He must be doin'
somethin' right.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.108
Officers.

05:17.108 --> 05:19.152
We'd like to make a statement
about the case.

05:19.152 --> 05:22.739
[sneezes]
I'm really gonna regret
moving to Pacific Northwest

05:22.739 --> 05:24.824
'if I can't get on top
of these allergies.'

05:24.824 --> 05:26.785
Officers, thank you so much

05:26.785 --> 05:28.620
for your quick response
on the scene

05:28.620 --> 05:32.249
and for hopefully helping
to save a BHU student's life.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.042
Now, because
of the circumstances

05:34.042 --> 05:35.669
the senator's daughter
and Caitlin

05:35.669 --> 05:37.420
are so close
with the Hotchkiss family

05:37.420 --> 05:39.297
Mrs. Hotchkiss has empowered me

05:39.297 --> 05:41.633
to take control
of this investigation.

05:41.633 --> 05:45.178
We're here to help you and the
Hotchkiss family any way we can.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.722
'Beacon Heights
owes them so much.'

05:47.722 --> 05:49.641
Did I hear you were here
to make a statement?

05:51.101 --> 05:52.644
We're here
to support our friend.

05:52.644 --> 05:54.020
No matter what.

05:56.314 --> 06:01.987
♪ If I show you then I know
you won't tell what I said ♪

06:01.987 --> 06:07.617
♪ 'Cause two can keep a secret
if one of them is dead ♪♪

06:09.452 --> 06:11.329
When I found Taylor,
she was living in a camper

06:11.329 --> 06:13.290
and we left it near the quarry
when I drove her back.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.208
And you think
she's headed there now?

06:15.208 --> 06:16.668
I don't know where else
she would feel safe.

06:16.668 --> 06:19.713
[cell phone chimes]
I should get back to campus.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.215
I'm faculty advisor
for the fashion show.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.884
How did you pull that card?
I got campus clean-up day.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.178
- I would trade you if I could.
- Are you crazy?

06:27.178 --> 06:28.930
I have a student in surgery.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.349
And I found
and then lost a dead girl.

06:31.349 --> 06:33.893
I'm not exactly feeling
fashion-forward today.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.937
Well, the crew team
always makes the final race.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.856
So we have a few days
until Mason gets back.

06:37.856 --> 06:40.483
If he did this to Caitlin, then
she and your little proteges

06:40.483 --> 06:42.110
are safe for now.

06:42.110 --> 06:45.405
And if it helps,
I'll head out to the camper.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.823
Really?

06:46.823 --> 06:48.283
Well, I was hoping to connect
some more dots

06:48.283 --> 06:51.369
between Ray and Caitlin
and you, but..

06:51.369 --> 06:53.622
...gone girl gone again
trumps mystery list.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.124
Thank you.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.671
So you were really thinking
about leaving last night?

07:01.671 --> 07:04.090
Yeah.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.383
I didn't wanna
let myself believe

07:05.383 --> 07:07.427
that it was really my dad

07:07.427 --> 07:09.679
in case I was being played,
but..

07:09.679 --> 07:11.431
...as it got closer and closer
to the time

07:11.431 --> 07:14.142
that I was supposed
to meet him..

07:14.142 --> 07:16.603
...whether I wanted to or not

07:16.603 --> 07:19.064
I was all in.

07:19.064 --> 07:21.107
I just can't believe that
Dana went through all of that

07:21.107 --> 07:23.610
to lure you to the woods.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.195
I mean, what did she
expect to happen

07:25.195 --> 07:27.489
when you found out
that it was her, not your dad?

07:27.489 --> 07:30.116
She thought she could break me.

07:30.116 --> 07:33.703
And that I would turn on you
and Caitlin, and Allison too.

07:33.703 --> 07:36.539
It's like she's playing
some sick twisted game.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.583
Well, she might get off
on playing this like it's a game

07:38.583 --> 07:42.295
but she's dead serious
about winning.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.964
- Dana Booker does her homework.
- Yeah.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.466
And she picks on you
over and over again

07:46.466 --> 07:49.302
until you have no choice
but to bleed.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.970
Sounds like Mason.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.182
[cell phone chimes]

08:31.428 --> 08:32.470
She's out of surgery.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.097
[chuckles]

08:37.600 --> 08:38.977
They said she had
some internal bleeding

08:38.977 --> 08:40.186
but they were able
to take care of it.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.479
Okay, when do we see her?

08:41.479 --> 08:42.897
She'll be in recovery
for a while

08:42.897 --> 08:44.190
so there's,
there's not really much

08:44.190 --> 08:46.109
we can do
until she wakes up.

08:47.652 --> 08:48.945
Actually, there is.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.908
I know how we can prove
that Mason killed Nolan.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.368
Now you tell me.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.370
I saw the phone go down
in the sewer last night

08:57.370 --> 08:59.622
when Caitlin got hit.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.166
I mean,
she risked her life for this.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.417
I think the least
that we can do is make sure

09:02.417 --> 09:04.878
she didn't do it for nothing.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.338
I have to get ready
for the fashion show.

09:07.338 --> 09:10.592
God, I totally forgot.
I totally forgot.

09:10.592 --> 09:13.052
Okay, uh, go, go

09:13.052 --> 09:16.139
and I will, I'll meet up with
you after I get the phone, okay?

09:16.139 --> 09:17.223
- You sure?
- Yes.

09:17.223 --> 09:19.017
(Ava)
'Okay.'

09:19.017 --> 09:20.393
We're running
the models and designers

09:20.393 --> 09:22.145
to the final rehearsal
group by group.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.563
The lights are up,
just need to load the packages

09:23.563 --> 09:24.981
and test any additional flex

09:24.981 --> 09:26.399
the designers
are addin' to their shows.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.984
Awesome. Thank you, Zach.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.320
We literally could not have
pulled this off without you.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.739
Yeah, it will be a fun night.
I'll make sure of it, Miss D.

09:36.367 --> 09:38.286
Oh, hi.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.497
Thanks.

09:40.497 --> 09:41.623
- Hi.
- 'Hi.'

09:41.623 --> 09:42.874
Any updates on Caitlin?

09:42.874 --> 09:44.000
She just got out of surgery

09:44.000 --> 09:45.376
but they wouldn't let us
see her.

09:45.376 --> 09:47.504
Okay, well, take a deep breath

09:47.504 --> 09:49.714
and know that you're exactly
where you're supposed to be.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.342
The reps for the "Rag Mags"
and "Vogue," they RSVP'd.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.677
"Vogue." It's just that

09:54.677 --> 09:57.722
Caitlin and I we had a fight
and we said some things--

09:57.722 --> 09:59.808
When Caitlin wakes up, do you
think that she wants to know

09:59.808 --> 10:02.227
that you were just sitting there
waiting for her

10:02.227 --> 10:04.187
when there was nothing
that you could do?

10:04.187 --> 10:06.481
Or that you are nailing
your fashion show

10:06.481 --> 10:08.066
and getting that
"Vogue" internship

10:08.066 --> 10:10.068
that you've been working on
all semester?

10:11.194 --> 10:12.570
Uh, Zach.

23:13.601 --> 23:15.561
[sighs]
Mom.

23:17.396 --> 23:20.566
Mom, not telling her the truth
is a terrible idea.

23:20.566 --> 23:22.401
I've kept secrets
from people I care about

23:22.401 --> 23:26.113
and it always comes back
to haunt you.

23:26.113 --> 23:27.615
I know how much she loves you.

23:27.615 --> 23:29.908
I know that this could bring
you two closer together.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.577
I-I know it.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.704
You are a very wise woman..

23:36.332 --> 23:39.168
...but I'm sorry,
I can't take the risk.

23:39.168 --> 23:41.420
When I was a kid

23:41.420 --> 23:43.422
y-you'd sit us down,
just the three of us

23:43.422 --> 23:46.592
and we would decide as a family
if you'd run, do you remember?

23:46.592 --> 23:48.344
You're not a little girl
anymore.

23:48.344 --> 23:49.470
[sighs]

23:50.763 --> 23:52.264
So all those dinners

23:52.264 --> 23:54.183
I mean, you said
you'd put your family ahead

23:54.183 --> 23:57.144
of your political career,
that was just bullshit.

24:01.398 --> 24:02.733
I'm sorry.

24:04.318 --> 24:06.195
You already said that.

24:16.246 --> 24:17.581
[sniffles]

24:19.375 --> 24:20.709
Fine.

24:23.545 --> 24:26.965
- What?
- 'I'll do it.'

24:26.965 --> 24:28.759
I'll keep your secret,
because that's what

24:28.759 --> 24:31.553
a Park-Lewis does, right?

24:31.553 --> 24:33.847
We fall in line
and do whatever it takes

24:33.847 --> 24:35.891
to make sure you win the race.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.021
Thank you.

24:50.614 --> 24:52.032
[sobs]

24:53.033 --> 24:55.661
[indistinct chatter]

24:55.661 --> 24:57.454
Hey, did, uh,
did Andrew Villareal

24:57.454 --> 24:59.206
pick up his ticket?

24:59.206 --> 25:02.334
Um, no. You want it?

25:02.334 --> 25:04.336
'Show's about to start.
It's front row seat.'

25:06.338 --> 25:08.090
He's never missed
a performance in..

25:08.090 --> 25:09.842
He'll show up. I'm sure of it.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.260
- Thank you.
- 'Yeah.'

25:11.260 --> 25:12.845
Promise me you'll eat something.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.347
I can't have my models
passing out on the runway.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.391
- Woman from "Vogue" is here.
- Where?

25:17.391 --> 25:19.226
In the front row.
In the black.

25:19.226 --> 25:20.310
Everyone in the front row's
wearing black.

25:20.310 --> 25:21.603
She's the one in the middle.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.397
- With the "Primo" clout?
- Mm-hm.

25:23.397 --> 25:24.940
She already looks pissed and
the show hasn't even started.

25:24.940 --> 25:27.109
Look, it's 7:45, right?
We need to go get the phone.

25:27.109 --> 25:28.235
Yeah, well,
I sent Allison a text

25:28.235 --> 25:29.319
but I haven't heard back
from her.

25:29.319 --> 25:31.530
Now I'm sure she's here.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.948
Ava, if if we don't leave now

25:32.948 --> 25:34.158
we're not gonna make it
back in time, alright?

25:34.158 --> 25:36.994
Mason's on his way home.
Let's go.

25:36.994 --> 25:38.328
Okay, guys, why don't you guys
go get dressed?

25:38.328 --> 25:39.621
Just, please, do not sit.

25:39.621 --> 25:41.248
Lean or lay, but do not sit.

25:45.252 --> 25:47.421
[beeps]

25:47.421 --> 25:49.089
Oh.

25:49.089 --> 25:51.175
[keys clacking]

25:52.426 --> 25:54.178
[beeps]

25:54.178 --> 25:58.182
"Peter, Claire, Taylor. BH-4."

25:58.182 --> 26:00.267
Who's that?

26:00.267 --> 26:03.645
Note to Mona.
Who the hell is BH-4?

26:11.904 --> 26:12.863
Hm.

26:14.573 --> 26:17.826
'Taylor's Beacon Guard
tracks people's locations.'

26:17.826 --> 26:20.412
Impressive.

26:20.412 --> 26:23.916
Okay, what else can you do?

26:23.916 --> 26:26.251
[dramatic music]

26:27.836 --> 26:30.005
Claire, I think
you might wanna sit down.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.840
Well, I don't have time
to get comfortable, Alison.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.842
I was actually on my way
to the hospital to see Caitlin.

26:33.842 --> 26:36.136
I think
maybe you should have a sip.

26:36.136 --> 26:38.680
I really don't like surprises.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.682
Can you, please, just tell me
why it was so urgent

26:40.682 --> 26:42.184
for me to stop by?

26:42.184 --> 26:43.894
[floorboard creaking]

26:48.273 --> 26:50.192
[intense music]

26:51.485 --> 26:53.070

[indistinct chatter]

27:00.661 --> 27:02.955
[knock on door]

27:02.955 --> 27:05.374
I know you asked me
to stay away, but I couldn't..

27:08.710 --> 27:11.004
- Thanks for the coffee.
- Are you okay?

27:11.004 --> 27:12.673
I've been worried sick
about you.

27:12.673 --> 27:14.716
I'll be fine. Really.

27:16.927 --> 27:19.054
- Look, about--
- There's something I have to--

27:19.054 --> 27:21.849
[sighs]
Well, you go first.

27:21.849 --> 27:23.016
Okay.

27:23.016 --> 27:24.434
[sighs]

27:27.896 --> 27:29.982
There's something
I have to tell you.

27:29.982 --> 27:32.734
And I wanna be
completely honest with you.

27:36.822 --> 27:38.699
Nolan's dead,
but there's someone else

27:38.699 --> 27:41.076
who knows my secrets.

27:41.076 --> 27:44.955
And that person did this to me
on purpose.

27:47.291 --> 27:48.625
[sighs]

27:50.335 --> 27:52.087
His name is Mason Gregory.

27:52.087 --> 27:55.340
And I've known him
since I was a kid..

27:55.340 --> 27:57.259
[indistinct]

28:14.067 --> 28:15.569
[Claire chuckles]

28:17.112 --> 28:20.032
[dramatic music]

28:39.092 --> 28:40.719
And you're sure
you saw it go in there?

28:40.719 --> 28:43.013
One hundred percent.

28:43.013 --> 28:45.307
I know it's not the same thing
as getting hit by a car

28:45.307 --> 28:49.895
but I'm about to rummage through
a sewer looking like perfection.

28:49.895 --> 28:52.147
[chuckles]
If we can find his phone

28:52.147 --> 28:54.858
we can prove what Mason did
and all of this will be over.

28:57.152 --> 28:59.821
- For Caitlin.
- For Caitlin.

28:59.821 --> 29:01.990
- Ready?
- Yeah, on three.

29:01.990 --> 29:03.241
Alright.

29:03.241 --> 29:06.036
One, two, three.

29:06.036 --> 29:08.789
[clanking]

29:08.789 --> 29:10.374
[both sigh]

29:10.374 --> 29:11.500
Whoa.

29:12.918 --> 29:14.795
- You see anything?
- No.

29:16.129 --> 29:18.131
- Do you?
- Not really.

29:22.052 --> 29:24.471
[fluttering]

29:24.471 --> 29:27.391
[dramatic music]

29:31.395 --> 29:32.646

29:32.646 --> 29:34.189

Ava!

[keys clacking]

29:39.653 --> 29:41.029
[cell phone chimes]

29:53.542 --> 29:56.795
(Mona)
'Mason is in Beacon Heights?
That's not possible.'

29:56.795 --> 29:59.631
The crew team's not supposed
to be back until 10:00.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.049
Okay.

30:11.768 --> 30:13.478
[sighing]
Come on, Ali.

30:16.106 --> 30:17.315
Ava.

30:17.315 --> 30:19.443
[dramatic music]

30:23.655 --> 30:25.115
Ava.

30:30.328 --> 30:31.413
[Ava screaming at distance]

30:31.413 --> 30:33.331
Ava!

30:33.331 --> 30:35.292
Ava!

30:35.292 --> 30:38.211
[dramatic music]

30:46.178 --> 30:47.637
Mm, mom.

30:51.808 --> 30:54.269
[gasps]
Oh, my God.

30:54.269 --> 30:55.645
[upbeat music]

30:55.645 --> 30:58.231
- Hey, have you seen Ava?
- No.

30:58.231 --> 30:59.775
You're on in 20 minutes.

31:01.234 --> 31:03.445
Zach, h-have you seen
Ava or Dylan?

31:03.445 --> 31:04.946
No, not since the show started.

31:04.946 --> 31:06.865
Maybe they're out
pickin' snapdragons.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.785
[indistinct chatter]

31:10.827 --> 31:12.954
[dramatic music]

31:25.467 --> 31:27.094
[whispers]
Um, we're not alone here.

31:27.094 --> 31:28.929
- Something moving.
- Something or someone?

31:28.929 --> 31:31.139
I don't know.
I think I peed my pants.

31:31.932 --> 31:33.225
[intense music]

31:33.225 --> 31:34.267
[Ava screams]

31:34.267 --> 31:36.061
- Run.
- Oh, my God.

31:36.061 --> 31:37.104
What the hell is that?

31:37.104 --> 31:39.606
[gasping]
Help.

31:39.606 --> 31:41.316
No, no, no,
I need you to be quiet

31:41.316 --> 31:43.401
so that I can finish
what I started.

31:47.864 --> 31:49.491
Come on.

31:49.491 --> 31:52.494
[dramatic music]

31:52.494 --> 31:54.204
Oh, my God, come on.
Go. Go, go, go, go.

31:54.204 --> 31:56.456
Oh, my God.

31:56.456 --> 31:58.041
Come on, hurry.

31:58.041 --> 31:59.876
- Where are we?
- I don't even care.

31:59.876 --> 32:02.963
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know. Was it Mason?

32:02.963 --> 32:04.589
You mean,
the pig man with bulging eyes

32:04.589 --> 32:06.299
who's gonna haunt
my dreams forever?

32:06.299 --> 32:08.218
We have 50 minutes
to get to campus. Let's go.

32:08.218 --> 32:09.511
[car door closes]

32:13.056 --> 32:14.975
Is this what you're lookin' for?

32:14.975 --> 32:17.477
We found it in the sewer.

32:17.477 --> 32:19.813
Why did Caitlin
have Mason's phone?

32:19.813 --> 32:21.398
Because Mason killed Nolan.

32:21.398 --> 32:23.150
Caitlin knew that his phone
could prove it.

32:23.150 --> 32:25.610
And maybe you're hoping
to manipulate his phone

32:25.610 --> 32:28.572
to tell that story and throw
the stink off the real killer.

32:28.572 --> 32:29.990
'But I got there first.'

32:29.990 --> 32:32.033
'And you know
what this phone tells me?'

32:32.033 --> 32:34.494
My hunch about Mason was right.

32:34.494 --> 32:37.247
He didn't kill Nolan. He was
at a crew party that night.

32:37.247 --> 32:40.000
'There are multiple witnesses
who can verify that'

32:40.000 --> 32:43.086
including Beacon Guard
surveillance footage.

32:43.086 --> 32:45.005
Mason was nowhere
near Thorne Hall

32:45.005 --> 32:46.673
the night of Nolan's death.

32:48.049 --> 32:50.010
That's what
a real alibi looks like.

32:56.057 --> 32:58.101
[gasping]

32:58.101 --> 32:59.895
I really am sorry
that I scared you

32:59.895 --> 33:02.355
but I needed to tell you
the truth tonight.

33:02.355 --> 33:05.358
When I heard you got hit by that
car, nothing else mattered.

33:05.358 --> 33:07.360
All I could think about
was how great things used

33:07.360 --> 33:09.070
to be between us
and all the awful things

33:09.070 --> 33:11.114
'that I've put you through
since Nolan died.'

33:11.114 --> 33:13.033
Because I felt like
I was to blame.

33:15.493 --> 33:19.748
Cait, I, I pressured you
at the cabin.

33:19.748 --> 33:22.667
'And you had every right
to do what you did.'

33:22.667 --> 33:24.794
You know, I ditched the team.
I didn't even compete.

33:24.794 --> 33:27.589
- That's why we lost.
- You expect me to believe you?

33:27.589 --> 33:30.508
After everything you put us
through? After blackmailing us?

33:30.508 --> 33:33.803
- No, I screwed up big time.
- Yeah, you did.

33:33.803 --> 33:36.306
Truth is, Cait, I admired Nolan.

33:36.306 --> 33:38.308
The way he could get people
to do for him

33:38.308 --> 33:41.228
how he was always number one
with not having to do the work.

33:41.228 --> 33:43.063
I wanted that.

33:43.063 --> 33:46.191
And when he died, it was
my chance to do what he did.

33:46.191 --> 33:47.984
To be him.

33:47.984 --> 33:52.906
But I've realized that
being Nolan is not who I am.

33:52.906 --> 33:55.116
How the hell
did you know about Jeremy

33:55.116 --> 33:58.578
and everything else
you had on my friends?

33:58.578 --> 34:02.332
Cait, I was,
I was Nolan's insurance policy.

34:02.332 --> 34:04.626
He pissed off so many people
that he wanted to make sure

34:04.626 --> 34:06.503
at least one person knew
who his enemies were

34:06.503 --> 34:08.546
in case something happened
to him.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.842
I won't be bothering you
anymore.

34:16.346 --> 34:18.598
Mason,
I want what was in the box.

34:18.598 --> 34:20.850
- 'All of it.'
- What box?

34:20.850 --> 34:23.228
Nolan's stash of secrets
he kept at the greenhouse.

34:25.188 --> 34:28.275
I-I don't know anything
about that.

34:28.275 --> 34:30.860
You didn't steal it?

34:30.860 --> 34:34.698
Everything I know about you,
Cait, Nolan told me.

34:34.698 --> 34:37.993
If he had some kind of box
of secrets stashed away..

34:39.786 --> 34:41.955
[scoffs]

34:41.955 --> 34:44.165
I guess Nolan had
two insurance policies.

34:48.753 --> 34:50.255
[all cheering]

34:50.255 --> 34:53.174
[upbeat music]

35:01.141 --> 35:04.060
[indistinct chatter]

35:08.023 --> 35:11.151
- Hey.
- Dana got the phone before us.

35:11.151 --> 35:13.570
And it wasn't Mason. He was
at a crew party all night.

35:13.570 --> 35:16.072
Phone proves it
and so does Beacon Guard.

35:16.072 --> 35:17.657
- Later.
- Okay.

35:17.657 --> 35:19.492
Ava, your snapdragons came in.

35:19.492 --> 35:21.119
Your models, they're good.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.621
[sniffs]
You? Is that sewage?

35:23.621 --> 35:25.206
Yeah, it's kind
of a long story.

35:25.206 --> 35:27.584
- Okay, Elizabeth..
- You're on in two minutes.

35:27.584 --> 35:28.960
Hey, your friend never came
to pick up the ticket.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.212
I had to give the seat away.

35:31.212 --> 35:32.756
What's that smell?

35:35.091 --> 35:36.801
Well, unless we could do
this thing naked

35:36.801 --> 35:38.887
I don't know
how we're gonna pull this off.

35:47.854 --> 35:50.607
Oh, my God.

35:50.607 --> 35:53.151
- That's it.
- What? I was joking.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.612
No, just take off that filthy
jacket and go play your ass off.

35:55.612 --> 35:57.447
- What?
- I'm serious.

35:57.447 --> 35:59.407
Go, trust me.

35:59.407 --> 36:02.327
[instrumental music]

36:07.290 --> 36:10.210
[violin music]

36:11.294 --> 36:14.214
[all cheering]

36:44.619 --> 36:47.288
- How do I look?
- Honestly, like a hot mess.

36:47.288 --> 36:48.289
Perfect.

36:49.416 --> 36:52.335
[all cheering]

37:10.395 --> 37:12.439
(Ava)
Thank you all for coming.

37:15.442 --> 37:17.026
When I first started
this collection

37:17.026 --> 37:20.447
it was about being perfect.

37:20.447 --> 37:22.073
Every stitch in the right place

37:22.073 --> 37:26.161
every accessory paired perfectly
with each design.

37:26.161 --> 37:28.913
Because I spent my whole life
trying to be perfect.

37:28.913 --> 37:32.625
And we spend our whole lives
trying to be clean

37:32.625 --> 37:35.420
but that-that's just not
how life works.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.130
And sometimes
the most beautiful things

37:37.130 --> 37:40.216
can come
from the ugliest of places.

37:40.216 --> 37:42.844
And from our imperfections

37:42.844 --> 37:45.013
we learn and we grow.

37:46.723 --> 37:50.185
And from the dirt
blooms the flower.

37:52.228 --> 37:55.148
[applause]

37:55.982 --> 37:58.902
[all cheering]

38:03.156 --> 38:06.075
[violin music]

38:27.013 --> 38:29.933
[indistinct chatter]

38:32.101 --> 38:35.104
- Oh, that was great.
- Thank you, thank you so much.

38:35.104 --> 38:37.857
Okay, it was awesome.
Thank you so much.

38:39.150 --> 38:41.653
Hey, you okay?

38:41.653 --> 38:44.864
Yeah. I'm fine, I'm fine.
That was awesome.

38:44.864 --> 38:47.283
I mean,
how-how did we pull that off?

38:47.283 --> 38:49.744
- That was awesome.
- It was amazing. Thank you.

38:49.744 --> 38:51.663
Couldn't have done it
without you.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.373
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

38:58.711 --> 39:00.630
What is your damage?

39:00.630 --> 39:02.048
You really don't know who I am,
do you?

39:02.048 --> 39:03.341
Should I?

39:03.341 --> 39:05.927
I'm Zach Fordson.

39:05.927 --> 39:07.804
Maybe you've seen my dad's name
in some court documents

39:07.804 --> 39:09.055
Kevin Fordson.

39:10.807 --> 39:13.142
Your dad stole
my parents' life savings

39:13.142 --> 39:15.103
my college fund, everything.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.315
Any more questions?

39:26.155 --> 39:28.866
(Ava)
'Alright, if the pig man
wasn't Mason, then--'

39:28.866 --> 39:30.243
Is that what we're calling him,
the pig man?

39:30.243 --> 39:31.578
'Cause I don't..

39:31.578 --> 39:33.162
That's not
nearly as scary-sounding

39:33.162 --> 39:35.039
as it needs to be.

39:35.039 --> 39:36.791
It was a warning, right?

39:36.791 --> 39:38.042
'Someone out there
has our secrets'

39:38.042 --> 39:40.044
and they want us to know it.

39:50.972 --> 39:53.391
I'm really sorry
about the things I said to you.

39:56.978 --> 39:58.521
It's okay.

40:00.273 --> 40:02.317
You had every right to be mad.

40:05.278 --> 40:08.031
If it wasn't Mason, then we're
back to square one, guys.

40:08.031 --> 40:10.325
No, it's worse than square one.

40:10.325 --> 40:11.993
Cait, you're in the hospital.

40:11.993 --> 40:14.329
The game's changed.

40:14.329 --> 40:16.205
There's something
that's been bugging me.

40:18.166 --> 40:22.503
I mean, maybe we've been looking
at this all wrong.

40:22.503 --> 40:24.714
Maybe the person who's doing
this to us didn't kill Nolan.

40:26.507 --> 40:28.426
Or maybe they think
that we did.

40:28.426 --> 40:32.430
And she's been using our secrets
to drive a wedge between us.

40:32.430 --> 40:33.973
'To break us apart.'

40:33.973 --> 40:37.518
[scoffs]
Divide and conquer.

40:37.518 --> 40:39.354
Dana Booker. Mm-hmm.

40:39.354 --> 40:41.064
She breaks into your apartment,
right?

40:41.064 --> 40:43.191
Pretends to be your dad,
the re-route to the woods

40:43.191 --> 40:44.651
'trying to get you
to break and turn on us.'

40:44.651 --> 40:46.444
And we know
she thinks we killed Nolan.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.696
[scoffs]
She tried to blackmail me
just like Nolan did.

40:48.696 --> 40:51.366
At his funeral, she said
she would do whatever it takes.

40:51.366 --> 40:54.827
Stop, stop. Are we saying
that Dana dressed up as a pig

40:54.827 --> 40:57.664
to scare you guys in the sewer?
Because that's extreme.

40:57.664 --> 40:59.332
She just hit you with a car,
Caitlin.

40:59.332 --> 41:00.750
And whether it was Dana
or one of her henchmen

41:00.750 --> 41:02.210
she's playing with us.

41:02.210 --> 41:04.379
It's part of her sick,
twisted game.

41:04.379 --> 41:07.590
- If we're right about this..
- We match her game.

41:07.590 --> 41:09.592
Whatever it takes.

41:09.592 --> 41:11.552
- Whatever it takes.
- Whatever it takes.

41:11.552 --> 41:13.971
[dramatic music]

41:13.971 --> 41:15.515
[beeping]

41:20.019 --> 41:22.814
(Mona)
'How could Nolan Hotchkiss be
at my apartment?'

41:29.028 --> 41:31.948
[theme music]
