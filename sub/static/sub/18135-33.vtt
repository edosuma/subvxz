00:45.011 --> 00:48.680
Exactly what I need
to intensify my own device.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.550
Once I connect it
to my Kryptonite
radiation emitter,

00:51.585 --> 00:55.887
I'll have everything I need
to destroy Superman. (LAUGHS)

Please surrender, or I'll...

02:56.076 --> 02:57.742
ask you a second time.

02:57.777 --> 02:59.010

Let me get this straight.

03:47.594 --> 03:50.061
Bad red versions of both
of them knocked you around,

03:50.096 --> 03:53.265
then flew off with
a faulty radiation emitter?

03:53.300 --> 03:56.601
Faulty? My device
exceeded expectations!

03:56.636 --> 03:58.937
Your red opposites
have half your powers

03:58.972 --> 04:00.805

We may have some of Flash's

04:15.922 --> 04:19.224
Guest? (STAMMERS)
Maybe we should
check in with Batman.

04:19.259 --> 04:23.495
Before someone decides
to redecorate Luthor's cell.

04:23.530 --> 04:26.431
My primary concern is
where they took that emitter,

04:26.466 --> 04:27.766
and what they plan
to do with it.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.467
If we found them,
we could ask them.

04:29.502 --> 04:32.971
Told ya. They've taken good
to a whole new level.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.706
A weird one.

04:34.741 --> 04:37.208
The emitter has
a unique Kryptonite
radiation signature.

04:37.243 --> 04:39.678
I should be able to track it
with our satellite.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.579
Well, that's clever thinking.

04:41.614 --> 04:43.915

04:48.188 --> 04:51.690

04:51.725 --> 04:53.525
-Let's go.
-Hip, hip, hooray!

04:53.560 --> 04:55.393
We'd be only
too happy to help.

04:55.428 --> 04:56.695

04:56.730 --> 05:00.532
Maybe you two could keep

Then we make duplicates of

already told the Bat.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.790
That's right. It won't.

06:57.484 --> 07:00.852
You're thinking too small.

07:00.887 --> 07:03.521
If we connect the emitter
to the Watchtower,

07:03.556 --> 07:07.058
and beam the signal
through our satellites
around the world,

07:07.093 --> 07:11.830
we can split everyone at once,
including the entire League.

07:11.865 --> 07:14.799
The reds
will conquer the blues,

07:14.834 --> 07:17.202
