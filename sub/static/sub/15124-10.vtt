WEBVTT

00:02.670 --> 00:04.672
Whoo!

00:04.705 --> 00:05.739
* Here we go

00:05.773 --> 00:09.177
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

00:10.778 --> 00:11.979
JIMMY:
Now that Hope was three,

00:12.012 --> 00:14.115
this was probably gonna be
the first Christmas

00:14.148 --> 00:15.015
she remembered.

00:16.584 --> 00:18.686
So I worked double shifts
to be able to afford

00:18.719 --> 00:19.853
everything she wanted.

00:19.887 --> 00:23.091
Of course, I wasn't just
sacrificing my time,

00:23.124 --> 00:25.493
I was sacrificing
my self-respect.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.061
(bells jingling)

00:27.095 --> 00:28.196
* We wish you a Howdy's
Christmas *

00:28.229 --> 00:30.198
* We wish you
a Howdy's Christ... *

00:30.231 --> 00:31.499
(bells jingling)

00:31.532 --> 00:33.701
* We wish you
a Howdy's Christmas *

00:33.734 --> 00:37.171
* And a low-priced New Year!

00:37.205 --> 00:39.073
I'm guessing she has
a coupon or two?

00:39.107 --> 00:40.508
Indeed.
BARNEY:
I'll take this.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.376
Sabrina,

00:42.410 --> 00:45.513
extreme couponers need to be
dealt with by extreme cashiers.

00:45.546 --> 00:46.414
Virginia.

00:46.447 --> 00:47.381
Barney.

00:47.415 --> 00:48.582
What have you got today?

00:48.616 --> 00:50.218
I have half off
from the manufacturer,

00:50.251 --> 00:51.219
which is stackable.

00:51.252 --> 00:53.687
That means she can combine
it with other coupons.

00:53.721 --> 00:57.291
So, I will also be using
this 20% off store coupon,

00:57.325 --> 01:00.628
which I will them
combine with a BOGO.
Buy one get one free.

01:00.661 --> 01:03.131
What do you need with this
many dryer sheets, anyway?

01:03.164 --> 01:03.997
They have thousands of uses.

01:04.031 --> 01:05.266
They're great
for getting rid of bugs.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.101
You can use them
as air fresheners.

01:07.135 --> 01:09.203
Deodorant, napkins.
And if you're
in a pinch,

01:09.237 --> 01:11.239
you can use one
as a coffee filter.

01:11.272 --> 01:12.573
You're abusing the system.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.108
The grocery
store economy

01:14.142 --> 01:15.109
is very volatile.

01:15.143 --> 01:16.377
I'm already
one broilworm

01:16.410 --> 01:18.279
larvae outbreak
in Southeast Asia away

01:18.312 --> 01:19.347
from losing half
my produce section,

01:19.380 --> 01:22.150
and now you're trying
to kill me in home and garden.

01:22.183 --> 01:23.284
Yeah, well, I really
wouldn't worry about it

01:23.317 --> 01:25.153
because the world
as we know it

01:25.186 --> 01:27.455
is going to end
on Friday, Barney.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.823
So while the rest of you
are fighting each other

01:29.857 --> 01:32.560
over a sip of water
from a radioactive puddle,

01:32.593 --> 01:35.496
I will be sitting safely
in my survival bunker

01:35.529 --> 01:39.300
sipping a nice, hot cup
of static-free,

01:39.333 --> 01:42.270
spring-rain-scented java.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.737
JIMMY:
Did I not mention
my mother thinks

01:43.771 --> 01:45.506
the world is gonna end
next Friday?

01:45.539 --> 01:48.242
It all started
about two years ago.

01:48.276 --> 01:50.478
MAN:
And when you look at the fact
that the Mayan calendar

01:50.511 --> 01:53.481
ends on December 21, 2012,

01:53.514 --> 01:56.184
the only logical conclusion
you can come to is

01:56.217 --> 01:58.852
the world is going to end.

01:58.886 --> 02:00.521
Can that be true?

02:00.554 --> 02:02.756
Now, let's take a few callers--
Wilfrid in Camden County.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.359
WILFRID:
What you're saying
is totally true, man.

02:05.393 --> 02:07.928
I heard it on a different
radio show yesterday.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.230
Oh, my God.

02:09.263 --> 02:11.165
It's true.

02:11.199 --> 02:12.666
Are we all gonna die?

02:12.700 --> 02:14.302
That's my worst fear--

02:14.335 --> 02:16.170
to be here one day
and gone the next.

02:16.204 --> 02:18.239
Like I never even existed.

02:18.272 --> 02:21.375
I guess this means I need
to get my bucket list started.

02:21.409 --> 02:22.643
Bucket list?

02:22.676 --> 02:23.844
You're 114 years old.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.313
What the hell have
you been waiting for?

02:25.346 --> 02:27.715
Hey, I didn't know
what a bucket list was.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.350
The movie
just came out.

02:29.383 --> 02:32.220
By the way,
spoiler alert-- it sucks.

02:32.253 --> 02:34.488
The good news is
I found out about this now.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.190
Now, I've got a plan.

02:36.224 --> 02:39.227
The Chance family is
gonna be ready for this.

02:39.260 --> 02:42.396
Mom was serious
about us preparing,

02:42.430 --> 02:45.366
so she gave us all jobs.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.335
Dad was in charge of handling
any looters, mutants or aliens.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.370
So he'd know how
to reason with them,

02:49.403 --> 02:50.504
he tried to learn

02:50.538 --> 02:53.374
some down-home psychology
from Dr. Phil.

02:53.407 --> 02:54.808
Aw, man.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.245
He just said, "You
can lie to yourself

02:57.278 --> 02:59.413
"and pretend you're on a
first-class flight to London,

02:59.447 --> 03:00.914
"but everybody
else knows you're

03:00.948 --> 03:03.684
on a freight train
to Stupid Town."

03:03.717 --> 03:06.387
That should make her
stop huffing paint.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.256
And if reasoning didn't work,

03:08.289 --> 03:09.490
Dad was taking
a Krav Maga class

03:09.523 --> 03:11.225
down at the community center.

03:11.259 --> 03:13.427
Come on,
use your extra arms.

03:13.461 --> 03:15.529
He's got to be prepared
for anything these aliens

03:15.563 --> 03:17.197
and/or mutants throw at us.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.235
Kick him in the neck, Burt.

03:21.269 --> 03:23.404
We have no idea where these
aliens' testicles will be.

03:24.272 --> 03:25.573
(groans)

03:27.808 --> 03:30.278
And since I was the best in the
family at the game Operation,

03:30.311 --> 03:33.281
Mom put me in charge of
post-apocalyptic first aid.

03:33.314 --> 03:35.283
So, hey, before you tape
his stomach closed,

03:35.316 --> 03:38.419
can you show me which one
of those things is his liver?

03:38.452 --> 03:40.554
Mom set up a survival bunker
in the cellar and filled it

03:40.588 --> 03:42.690
with all the things
necessary to survive,

03:42.723 --> 03:45.693
which she paid for
using extreme couponing.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.261
We're gonna be billionaires
if I'm right

03:47.295 --> 03:49.263
about dental floss
being the new currency.

03:49.297 --> 03:51.031
(game buzzes)
And Maw Maw was figuring out

03:51.064 --> 03:53.367
everything she wanted to do
before she died.

03:53.401 --> 03:56.404
Hey, Maw Maw, I found a coupon
for the tattoo parlor.

03:56.437 --> 03:57.905
Wasn't that
on your bucket list?

03:57.938 --> 03:59.307
Well, it was
until this morning.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.443
(laughs)

04:02.476 --> 04:04.878
Now, all I got to do
is go car-surfing,

04:04.912 --> 04:07.615
get in a fistfight,
sleep with a black man

04:07.648 --> 04:10.484
and do stand-up comedy.

04:10.518 --> 04:11.184
(game buzzes)

04:11.218 --> 04:13.621
(groans)
Stupid breadbasket.

04:13.654 --> 04:16.290
Even when we had major changes
in our lives,

04:16.324 --> 04:18.859
we were still planning
for the end of the world.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.063
Hey, Sabrina, right?

04:23.096 --> 04:26.300
Oh, yeah, Johnny, right?

04:26.334 --> 04:27.368
Uh, close enough.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.303
Do you guys have any more
Band-Aids in the back?

04:29.337 --> 04:32.306
I'm supposed to get
like 600 boxes.

04:32.340 --> 04:35.376
Planning on skinning your knees
a few times, are you?

04:35.409 --> 04:37.478
(laughs)
Nah, nah.

04:37.511 --> 04:38.912
We're stocking up
for the end of the world.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.448
I'm sorry, what?

04:42.115 --> 04:44.752
Dad, the cute girl at the
grocery store told me

04:44.785 --> 04:46.854
that all this stuff about the
end of the world is a fallacy,

04:46.887 --> 04:49.457
and fallacy doesn't mean
"penis," it means "not true."

04:49.490 --> 04:50.257
Shh. Watch it.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.626
You want your mother
to hear you?

04:52.660 --> 04:54.928
Of course the world's
not gonna end.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.465
You knew this?
For how long?

04:57.498 --> 04:59.800
For years-- went to the
library and checked it out.

04:59.833 --> 05:02.603
It's all a big hoax like bigfoot
or the Loch Ness monster,

05:02.636 --> 05:04.372
or the Underwater Gorilla.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.374
Then why are we
stockpiling food

05:06.407 --> 05:08.509
and learning how to fight
aliens and/or mutants?

05:08.542 --> 05:10.043
Jimmy, we got four-years worth

05:10.077 --> 05:11.211
of ice cream sandwiches
in the basement.

05:11.244 --> 05:13.981
Plus I get to spend my weekends
fake-fighting aliens.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.115
It's a win-win.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.050
Aw, I guess you're right.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.953
Besides Rosa's family's
totally convinced.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.355
We're gonna look
like jerks if we don't

05:21.389 --> 05:22.390
at least pretend to believe.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.492
And when the super
volcano blows,

05:24.525 --> 05:27.961
the entire world will be covered
in ash and all of humanity will

05:27.995 --> 05:31.499
be plunged into darkness and
despair for thousands of years.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.033
It's true.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.469
Enjoy your caramel crunch.

05:37.405 --> 05:40.374
Mommy, we're all gonna die!

05:43.677 --> 05:45.579
So rather than have
a big fight with Mom,

05:45.613 --> 05:46.914
we just humored her.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.416
Look what I bought online.

05:48.449 --> 05:51.385
Turns urine
into drinkable water.

05:51.419 --> 05:53.153
It's used but I
got a good deal.

05:53.186 --> 05:56.156
Just needs a few go-rounds
in the dishwasher.

05:56.189 --> 05:59.527
Six more months and
this'll all be over.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.503
(clicking tongue, squeaks)

06:10.070 --> 06:11.104
(grunts)

06:11.138 --> 06:12.606
(groans)

06:12.640 --> 06:14.475
Nice work.

06:14.508 --> 06:17.478
No matter where I had testicles,
that would have hurt them.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.483
Three more months
and it'll all be over.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.518
Drill! Evacuation drill!

06:24.552 --> 06:26.720
Sabrina, if you're gonna become
a member of this family,

06:26.754 --> 06:28.188
you need a job-- you're in
charge of figuring out how to

06:28.221 --> 06:30.524
cook anything that survives
the initial... whatever.

06:30.558 --> 06:32.025
Now, everybody get out
on the front lawn,

06:32.059 --> 06:33.727
tuck yourselves into a little
ball and hold your breath.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.629
You should be up to
three minutes by now.

06:36.964 --> 06:40.868
(yawns): One more month
and this'll all be over.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.471
Which brings us to today...

06:43.504 --> 06:44.438
Offer expires January fourth.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.474
Coupon must be presented
at time of purchase.

06:46.507 --> 06:49.910
Each coupon good for a maximum
of 12 boxes per customer!

06:49.943 --> 06:52.646
Customer can use
a maximum of four coupons,

06:52.680 --> 06:55.148
which means you and Burt
can only buy 96 boxes.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.617
You need to put half these back.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.552
Hopes buying some of these.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.160
You'll have to put
48 boxes back.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.562
Jimmy, get in line.

07:08.596 --> 07:10.631
(groans)

07:10.664 --> 07:13.501
Three more days
and it's all over.

07:13.534 --> 07:14.935
Sure, for everybody else.

07:14.968 --> 07:18.606
For us, it's just the beginning.

07:28.616 --> 07:29.583
JIMMY:
With all the craziness

07:29.617 --> 07:30.984
of preparing
for the world to end,

07:31.018 --> 07:32.520
it was easy to forget that

07:32.553 --> 07:34.622
Christmas was right
around the corner.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.524
But I was still
determined to make Hope's

07:36.557 --> 07:38.659
first Christmas memory
a special one.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.961
And that meant explaining
all the traditions to Hope,

07:40.994 --> 07:42.996
and making sure we did
every last one of them.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.498
And then he leaves

07:44.532 --> 07:47.267
presents under the Christmas
tree for everyone,

07:47.300 --> 07:49.570
but especially you.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.138
(Maw Maw whooping)

07:55.242 --> 07:56.644
Only six more days
till Christmas,

07:56.677 --> 07:58.612
and then you get
to get the big piece.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.181
Oh-oh-oh, not yet, honey.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.116
We have to wait.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.052
Can you please stop?

08:05.085 --> 08:06.820
Make me, Nancy boy.

08:06.854 --> 08:09.523
I've only got three things
left on my bucket list,

08:09.557 --> 08:12.526
and I need to get
into a fistfight.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.596
Maw Maw, I'm not gonna fight
you-- you're a million

08:15.629 --> 08:16.897
years old and you
broke your pelvis

08:16.930 --> 08:18.131
falling off the
roof of that car.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.567
I'm sorry,
what did you just say?

08:19.600 --> 08:21.602
I'm not fluent in wussy.

08:23.771 --> 08:25.172
I'll fight you.

08:26.940 --> 08:27.975
You will?

08:28.008 --> 08:29.176
Oh, yeah.

08:29.209 --> 08:30.544
I've been wanting
to punch you in the face

08:30.578 --> 08:31.745
ever since you told me I looked

08:31.779 --> 08:33.947
like Ralph Macchio in drag.

08:35.583 --> 08:39.119
Let's do this.

08:43.724 --> 08:44.658
Hey, hey!

08:44.692 --> 08:46.727
Fistfight's happening.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.195
I'd be careful, Sabrina.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.763
Maw Maw doesn't always
play by the rules.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.766
I think I'll
be all right.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.669
(groans)
Aw!

09:01.108 --> 09:02.342
Ow!

09:02.375 --> 09:05.979
(grunting and groaning)

09:08.381 --> 09:10.283
No!
You're gonna
have to be

09:10.317 --> 09:11.719
tougher than that,
you skinny little

09:11.752 --> 09:13.587
Ralph-Macchio-looking bitch!

09:13.621 --> 09:16.089
(yelling)

09:16.123 --> 09:18.659
Well, we're all stocked up.

09:18.692 --> 09:20.360
Guess there's
nothing left to do

09:20.393 --> 09:21.729
but celebrate
Christmas tomorrow,

09:21.762 --> 09:23.063
and then climb into our

09:23.096 --> 09:24.965
hazmat suits and wait
for the Apocalypse.

09:24.998 --> 09:27.034
What do you mean celebrate
Christmas tomorrow?

09:27.067 --> 09:29.202
It's the 20th--
Christmas is the 25th.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.003
Jimmy,

09:30.037 --> 09:32.139
by the time
the 25th rolls around,

09:32.172 --> 09:34.274
Santa Claus will just
be a desperate old man

09:34.307 --> 09:36.376
in a red suit peddling
reindeer meat.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.779
We're having
Christmas tomorrow.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.781
Sounds good to me, honey.

09:40.814 --> 09:41.982
Good thinking.

09:42.015 --> 09:44.051
All right, this has
gone too far.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.886
I am not celebrating
Christmas tomorrow night.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.688
We've invested
two years in this.

09:47.721 --> 09:48.555
We're not
backing down now.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.258
We're still gonna
have real Christmas.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.794
Consider this
practice Christmas.

09:53.827 --> 09:56.096
We'll all wear matching pajamas,
we'll open some gifts.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.631
It'll make your mother happy.

09:57.665 --> 09:58.899
Fine.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.635
But I'm not giving Hope her real
presents until actual Christmas.

10:01.669 --> 10:02.836
Do whatever you want.

10:02.870 --> 10:04.805
All I care is that
we're done by 8:00.

10:04.838 --> 10:05.739
Your mother and I have quite

10:05.773 --> 10:07.708
the End of the World Eve
Love Fest planned.

10:07.741 --> 10:10.243
I'll spare you the graphic
specifics of the things

10:10.277 --> 10:12.312
I'm gonna do to your mother.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.648
It involves quite
a bit of pudding.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.993
I hope you didn't love her
for her face.

10:26.026 --> 10:28.428
'Cause she ain't
so pretty no more.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.297
So reluctantly, the next day we
all celebrated fake Christmas

10:30.330 --> 10:34.034
with all
of our Christmas traditions.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.870
And as it turned out,
there were actually

10:36.904 --> 10:40.107
some traditions
I didn't mind doing twice.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.810
Like opening gifts...

10:42.843 --> 10:44.712
Aw...

10:44.745 --> 10:46.914
A Hundred and One
Recipes for Insects.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.985
(both gasp)

10:52.019 --> 10:54.988
Sabrina, you shouldn't have.

10:55.022 --> 10:56.857
You know, I just thought
when we were running

10:56.890 --> 10:58.959
through crowds of people
whose skin was melting off,

10:58.992 --> 11:01.762
this would be a nice way
to keep things light.

11:01.795 --> 11:02.896
This is awesome!

11:02.930 --> 11:05.298
Somebody rip a big one.
Let's see if this thing works.

11:05.332 --> 11:08.335
JIMMY:
...or watching Ernest Saves
Christmas three times in a row.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.370
(laughing breathlessly)

11:13.741 --> 11:16.409
But there are some traditions
you can only do once.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.979
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

11:19.012 --> 11:21.248
You can't eat the big chocolate
until the 25th.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.883
It's not the 25th.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.719
Yeah, but we're celebrating
Christmas tonight, so...

11:27.888 --> 11:30.791
You let her eat 21 through 24?

11:30.824 --> 11:31.759
Of course I did.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.727
What do we have to wait for?
It's Christmas.

11:33.761 --> 11:35.863
No, it's not.
It's not Christmas.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.198
Christmas is in five days,
and that's when we're
going to celebrate it.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.333
I don't want her first memories
of Christmas to be weird.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.335
She's going to eat
the proper chocolate

11:42.369 --> 11:44.237
on the proper day.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.409
What are you doing?

11:49.442 --> 11:50.778
I'm gonna get
the chocolate hard,

11:50.811 --> 11:51.845
break it off my finger,

11:51.879 --> 11:53.413
and then put pieces of it
back in the calendar.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.215
Jimmy...

11:55.248 --> 11:56.349
you're being silly.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.819
I'm being silly?

11:58.852 --> 12:00.387
We've got three cases of
dog food in the basement

12:00.420 --> 12:02.255
labeled "zombie bait."

12:02.289 --> 12:03.356
So what are you saying?

12:03.390 --> 12:04.925
You don't think something's
gonna happen tomorrow?

12:04.958 --> 12:06.426
No. No, I don't, Mom.

12:06.459 --> 12:07.861
The only thing
I think is gonna happen

12:07.895 --> 12:09.129
is that you're gonna
feel like an idiot

12:09.162 --> 12:10.530
for eating 21 through 24.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.832
Because you're crazy.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.534
I'm not crazy.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.069
Oh, please.

12:16.103 --> 12:17.437
We all think you're crazy.

12:17.470 --> 12:18.806
Even Maw Maw
thinks you're crazy.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.808
Burt, is that true?

12:22.009 --> 12:23.276
Does everybody think I'm crazy?

12:23.310 --> 12:24.945
Not I.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.814
I think you're spot on
with this whole thing.

12:26.847 --> 12:27.881
JIMMY:
Really?

12:27.915 --> 12:29.282
You think that, huh?

12:29.316 --> 12:30.450
Yes, I do.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.185
Okay.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.422
Wouldn't even worry about Jimmy.

12:35.455 --> 12:38.258
He's not gonna last two weeks
against the mutant spider army.

12:38.291 --> 12:39.459
So... Jimmy, give me that.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.428
What's that?

12:41.461 --> 12:42.295
(grunts)

12:42.329 --> 12:43.931
Since we're celebrating
Christmas early,

12:43.964 --> 12:45.966
I thought we should
open up all the gifts.

12:45.999 --> 12:48.335
Dad hid this in my room.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.503
Looks like it has
your name on it, Mom!

12:52.605 --> 12:53.807
Ow, ow. Ow.

12:53.841 --> 12:55.175
Pie-of-the-Month Club?

12:55.208 --> 12:57.110
"I know you're
disappointed

12:57.144 --> 12:58.946
"that the world didn't end,

12:58.979 --> 13:00.814
"but at least we have pie.

13:00.848 --> 13:03.350
Love, Burt."

13:08.388 --> 13:10.457
You...

13:11.124 --> 13:12.926
Three hours.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.962
You couldn't wait
three more hours?

13:14.995 --> 13:17.998
And there goes my End of
the World Eve Love Fest.

13:18.031 --> 13:20.100
Ah, I can't believe
I was nice enough

13:20.133 --> 13:21.468
to spare you
the graphic specifics

13:21.501 --> 13:23.971
of what I was gonna do
to your mother.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.879
(whispering)

13:38.919 --> 13:41.922
Live with that image for the
rest of your life, big mouth.

13:53.433 --> 13:56.136
Well, it's ten seconds
to midnight, Mom.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.871
Maybe we should talk.

13:57.905 --> 13:59.873
I would hate to be mad
at each other

13:59.907 --> 14:02.175
when absolutely nothing happens.

14:02.209 --> 14:03.476
That's funny, Jimmy.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.378
You're a regular
Tosh period zero.

14:05.412 --> 14:06.379
Three...

14:06.413 --> 14:08.048
two...

14:08.081 --> 14:09.549
one.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.353
Good night.

14:14.955 --> 14:17.424
No one said it would happen
exactly at midnight.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.893
We got 24 hours.

14:19.927 --> 14:22.629
*

14:27.534 --> 14:28.301
Morning.

14:28.335 --> 14:31.271
Ah, another
beautiful day, huh?

14:31.304 --> 14:34.341
Guess the Grim Reaper
must've hit the snooze button.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.576
Shut up.

14:36.609 --> 14:37.911
Hey, baby!

14:37.945 --> 14:39.412
(gags)

14:39.446 --> 14:41.381
I tried your
pee water thingy.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.216
(gags)

14:43.250 --> 14:46.453
It kind of works.

14:46.486 --> 14:47.687
Smart purchase.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.925
(retches)

14:59.666 --> 15:02.269
Oh, hi, Mr. and Mrs. Gutierrez.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.239
This is not to you.

15:06.273 --> 15:07.574
Not for you.

15:12.145 --> 15:14.547
Kim Kardashian
hasn't tweeted all day.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.450
The government obviously has
all the important celebrities

15:17.484 --> 15:19.486
hidden in an underground bunker.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.254
(computer chimes)

15:21.288 --> 15:23.123
Oh, wait, never mind.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.924
She was just getting a colonic.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.135
(muffled):
Thanks.

15:40.673 --> 15:42.675
(music winds down, stops)

15:45.078 --> 15:46.646
(music resumes)

15:50.083 --> 15:51.118
Mom! Mom, Mom, Mom!

15:51.151 --> 15:52.986
Mom!

15:53.020 --> 15:55.155
Everything's fine.

15:55.188 --> 15:55.989
(laughs)

15:56.023 --> 15:57.024
Ah!

16:05.132 --> 16:07.634
Guys. Guys! Guys!

16:09.502 --> 16:10.437
(Jimmy chuckling)

16:10.470 --> 16:12.372
Hey!

16:12.405 --> 16:15.542
Those marshmallows
are not toys, okay?

16:15.575 --> 16:18.145
They're only to be used
as possum bait

16:18.178 --> 16:20.347
or for celebrating the victory
of the surviving humans

16:20.380 --> 16:22.515
over the mutant aliens
with s'mores, okay?

16:22.549 --> 16:24.184
VIRGINIA:
Damn it!

16:29.489 --> 16:31.024
Hey...

16:31.058 --> 16:33.093
So, nothing happened.

16:33.126 --> 16:34.461
It's not the end of the world.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.096
(laughs)

16:36.129 --> 16:37.297
I can't believe this.
This totally sucks.

16:37.330 --> 16:41.701
Look, I know you planned for
this to happen and everything,

16:41.734 --> 16:43.736
but aren't you
the tiniest bit glad

16:43.770 --> 16:45.205
the world isn't over?

16:45.238 --> 16:46.073
No, I'm not.

16:46.106 --> 16:49.676
This was supposed to be
my moment, Burt.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.478
I was finally going
to show Jimmy

16:51.511 --> 16:53.146
that I could be a good mom.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.481
Jimmy thinks you're a good mom.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.216
Oh, please.

16:56.249 --> 16:57.650
Every week he dredges up

16:57.684 --> 17:00.120
some parenting disaster
from our past.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.721
How I didn't breastfeed him,

17:01.754 --> 17:04.357
how his first steps were
down a flight of stairs,

17:04.391 --> 17:07.094
how we forget him that time
at a Whitesnake concert.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.128
Oh, come on.

17:08.161 --> 17:09.329
What nine-year-old gets to say

17:09.362 --> 17:11.198
they spent a week on
the Whitesnake tour bus?

17:11.231 --> 17:14.534
I just thought that he would
look at me as a good mom,

17:14.567 --> 17:17.604
if three-quarters of the human
population was wiped out

17:17.637 --> 17:19.639
and I was prepared.

17:27.580 --> 17:28.848
Just for the record,

17:28.881 --> 17:31.118
her pelvis was broken
before I got here.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.132
Oh...

17:45.165 --> 17:47.434
You got me dryer sheets.

17:47.467 --> 17:48.701
Get used to it.

17:48.735 --> 17:51.104
You're getting them
for the next 374 years.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.639
(knock on door)

17:56.743 --> 17:58.611
Ai, thank God you're here.

17:58.645 --> 18:01.748
Oh, my God.
What happened to you?

18:01.781 --> 18:04.251
Since the world was going to
end, we sold everything

18:04.284 --> 18:06.153
and bought one-way first class
tickets to Disney World,

18:06.186 --> 18:09.456
so we could watch the end of
civilization from Tomorrowland.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.258
We thought it would be ironic.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.825
ROSA:
But then, when nothing happened,

18:12.859 --> 18:15.662
we had no money,
and no way to get back.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.264
It's hard to get
picked up hitchhiking

18:17.297 --> 18:18.265
with an alpaca.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.300
(alpaca hawks)

18:20.333 --> 18:21.601
What was that?

18:21.634 --> 18:24.137
He tried to spit at you,
but he's dehydrated.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.139
ROSA:
What are we going to do?

18:26.173 --> 18:27.507
Carlos sold his
ice cream truck,

18:27.540 --> 18:28.641
I quit my job,
we spent all our money,

18:28.675 --> 18:31.278
and all we have to show for it
is feet full of blisters

18:31.311 --> 18:34.681
and a souvenir mug
we've been using as a toilet.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.316
Jimmy, go get
your first-aid kit.

18:36.349 --> 18:37.284
I'll get you guys some water.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.752
Burt, calm her down.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.522
(imitating Dr. Phil):
You are gonna be okay.

18:42.555 --> 18:46.226
You're worried that you won't
come back from this?

18:46.259 --> 18:48.628
I'm here to assure you

18:48.661 --> 18:51.298
that dog don't hunt!

18:51.331 --> 18:53.366
What is he talking about?

18:53.400 --> 18:55.368
I don't know.

18:55.402 --> 18:57.804
But it's very folksy
and comforting.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.071
(hawks)

18:59.105 --> 19:01.608
JIMMY:
Without even really
thinking about it

19:01.641 --> 19:03.743
we all sprang into action.

19:08.681 --> 19:11.718
Dad found someone who didn't
mind using recycled water.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.624
Why are you recycling his pee?

19:17.657 --> 19:19.626
You could just give him
water from the tap.

19:19.659 --> 19:20.960
We're settling an old score.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.762
Isn't that right, buddy?

19:23.563 --> 19:24.831
(bellows)

19:24.864 --> 19:26.533
Damn it.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.868
Wacky Mexican pony, two;
Burt, zero.

19:29.436 --> 19:30.437
Oh!

19:35.708 --> 19:37.677
JIMMY:
With so many people
in the house,

19:37.710 --> 19:39.246
we had to figure out
creative ways

19:39.279 --> 19:40.513
to be able to afford
to feed everyone.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.649
I hope everybody enjoys this.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.384
It's glowworm tetrazzini.

19:44.417 --> 19:45.352
And if I cooked it right,

19:45.385 --> 19:46.686
there should still be
a little glow left.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.589
ALL:
Ooh...

19:51.291 --> 19:52.692
JIMMY:
We let Rosa and her family

19:52.725 --> 19:54.994
move into the survival bunker
we weren't using

19:55.027 --> 19:57.230
until they were
back on their feet.

19:59.799 --> 20:02.001
It took a while,
but Mom sold all the stuff

20:02.034 --> 20:03.670
she'd been stockpiling,
and used the money

20:03.703 --> 20:05.738
to help Carlos buy back
his ice cream truck.

20:08.408 --> 20:09.776
And before we knew it,

20:09.809 --> 20:11.611
Rosa's family was
back in business.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.713
It turns out Mom did
have us all prepared

20:13.746 --> 20:15.014
to deal with a disaster.

20:15.047 --> 20:18.918
The disaster just turned out
to be someone else's.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.620
I gotta say, Mom...

20:20.653 --> 20:22.622
maybe you're not
as crazy as I thought.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.757
Why, 'cause Rosa's crazier?

20:24.791 --> 20:26.626
The world still
didn't end, Jimmy.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.728
I'm not gonna start patting
myself on the back

20:28.761 --> 20:30.697
'cause Rosa's a bigger idiot
than I am.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.299
Sure, the world didn't end,

20:32.332 --> 20:34.267
but when you thought
it was going to,

20:34.301 --> 20:36.403
you didn't blow everything
to have fun, like Rosa did.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.638
You made sure your family
was protected.

20:38.671 --> 20:41.040
That's pretty cool.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.909
That is pretty cool.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.478
Hey, where's Maw Maw?

20:45.512 --> 20:46.646
I don't know.

20:46.679 --> 20:49.382
She said she had
something to do.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.420
If you ever voted
for a president

20:53.453 --> 20:55.655
whose picture's on money,

20:55.688 --> 20:57.724
you might be an old person.
(crowd laughs)

20:57.757 --> 21:01.561
If the expiration date
on your can of peaches

21:01.594 --> 21:04.764
has Roman numerals on it?

21:04.797 --> 21:06.766
You might be an old person.

21:06.799 --> 21:09.902
You ever had a three-way
with Lewis and Clark,

21:09.936 --> 21:11.571
might be an old person.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.672
(crowd laughs)

21:12.705 --> 21:14.674
If you throw away
your change purse

21:14.707 --> 21:17.744
and start keeping your quarters
in your elbow,

21:17.777 --> 21:19.946
you might be an old person.
(crowd laughing)

21:19.979 --> 21:22.949
If you ever bought or sold

21:22.982 --> 21:24.384
a human being...

21:24.417 --> 21:27.520
CROWD:
You might be an old person.

21:27.554 --> 21:28.588
(laughing)

21:28.621 --> 21:31.624
You might be an old person.
