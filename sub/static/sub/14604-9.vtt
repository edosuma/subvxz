Last night, Harlan and I...

00:10.335 --> 00:11.934
<i>Harlan</i> Harlan?
My dad's friend Harlan?

00:11.936 --> 00:13.135
Yes. We're still together.

00:13.137 --> 00:14.837
I am so smitten with you,

00:14.839 --> 00:16.539
I wanted to go out of my way to see
your gorgeous face.

00:16.541 --> 00:17.673
Really,
I couldn't be happier

00:17.675 --> 00:18.841
that you got into Harvard.

00:18.843 --> 00:20.643
Do you not love me anymore?

00:20.645 --> 00:21.844
Maybe I'm just exhausted

00:21.846 --> 00:23.346
from your endless need
for competition.

00:23.348 --> 00:24.847
I've been wanting
to move to Laguna full-time.

00:24.849 --> 00:26.048
I don't know, dad.

00:26.050 --> 00:27.883
It's a done deal, Sebastian.
You're coming.

00:27.885 --> 00:29.418
We can make
long-distance work.

00:29.420 --> 00:32.822
I refuse to say "Good-bye"
because it's not good-bye.

00:51.075 --> 00:53.108
Do you know when he'll be back?

01:00.351 --> 01:02.117
Did Sebastian call?

01:02.119 --> 01:04.687
You just missed him.

01:04.688 --> 01:06.622
<i>It seemed like no matter how

01:06.624 --> 01:09.858
<i>to make
time for each other...</i>

01:09.860 --> 01:12.394

01:12.396 --> 01:14.163
Hello?

01:14.165 --> 01:15.497
Oh, it's you!

01:15.499 --> 01:17.132
It's really you.
I can't believe it.

01:17.134 --> 01:18.333
I know.
It was starting to seem

01:18.335 --> 01:19.968
like the world
didn't want us to talk.

01:19.970 --> 01:22.237
But the world did...
want us to talk.

01:22.239 --> 01:24.373
And... and here we are,
talking.

01:24.375 --> 01:26.575
- Pretty great.
- So great.

01:26.577 --> 01:29.478
So tell me everything.
What have you been up to?

01:29.480 --> 01:30.579
How is it with your dad?

01:30.581 --> 01:32.080
<i>Please deposit</i>

01:32.082 --> 01:33.482
<i>an additional 35 cents</i>

01:33.484 --> 01:35.851

<i>this long-distance call.</i>

01:35.853 --> 01:38.186
No problem, Mrs. Operator.

01:38.188 --> 01:41.189
I've got my change purse
right here.

01:41.191 --> 01:43.125
No. No, no, no.

01:43.127 --> 01:45.494
No.
<i>Your call will be disconnected</i>

01:45.496 --> 01:47.996
<i>if you don't deposit</i>

01:47.998 --> 01:50.665

02:06.016 --> 02:08.083
Kinda have to get to my locker.

02:08.085 --> 02:10.384
Let me guess...
Nerdling needs to study

02:10.387 --> 02:11.720
on her lunch break.

02:11.722 --> 02:14.456
I don't have to study...

02:14.458 --> 02:16.925
At all.
I got into Harvard.

02:16.927 --> 02:18.059
Why so blue?

02:18.061 --> 02:19.494
Realizing your last
cute boyfriend was West

02:19.496 --> 02:20.862
and you blew that?

02:20.864 --> 02:24.632
I mean, sure, it feels weird
that we're not together,

02:24.634 --> 02:27.602
but it feels even weirder
to have gotten into Harvard.

02:27.604 --> 02:28.970
Why?

02:28.972 --> 02:31.539
I've been trying to get in
since I came out of the womb.

02:31.541 --> 02:32.907
And now I did.

02:32.909 --> 02:34.175
Suddenly I'm
a goal-less wonder.

02:34.177 --> 02:36.344
What am I supposed to do
till I attend in the fall?

02:36.346 --> 02:38.379
Kiss lots and lots
of cute boys.

02:38.381 --> 02:39.781
That's your job.

02:39.783 --> 02:40.882
Apparently one
I've done too well.

02:40.884 --> 02:42.216
I realized today that

02:42.218 --> 02:44.552
the well of eligible bachelors
in this school

02:44.554 --> 02:46.087
has run dry.

02:46.089 --> 02:49.123
There's no way
you've dated <i>everyone.</i>

02:49.125 --> 02:50.625
I have.

02:50.627 --> 02:52.727
What about David Leventhal?

02:52.729 --> 02:55.697
Or Kyle Newman?

02:55.699 --> 02:58.466
Quiz Bowl and Mathletes
over there do not count.

02:58.468 --> 03:00.301
By "eligible," I mean <i>hot.</i>

03:00.303 --> 03:02.470
And I've dated them all...
Even Walt, and he's gay.

03:02.472 --> 03:06.040
It's gonna be a long bust
of a spring semester.

03:06.042 --> 03:07.775
Look at us...

03:07.777 --> 03:09.877
Two girls with no purpose.

03:09.879 --> 03:11.012
Positively shocking to think

03:11.014 --> 03:12.213
I have something
in common with you.

03:12.215 --> 03:15.316
Tell me about it.

03:15.318 --> 03:17.618
Well, well, well.

03:17.620 --> 03:21.155
I spy with my little eye
something very interesting.

03:21.157 --> 03:23.924
I thought you said
you dated every eligible guy.

03:23.926 --> 03:26.794
It's Mini-Bradshaw.
Is she smiling?

03:28.598 --> 03:30.798
I've known her since she was 5.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.367
I don't think I've ever
seen her teeth before.

03:33.369 --> 03:36.070
Finally some titillating
boy intrigue.

03:36.072 --> 03:37.471
I'm going in for a closer look.

03:37.473 --> 03:39.907
Have fun with your books, nerd.

03:39.909 --> 03:41.675
I wish I could.

03:41.677 --> 03:45.346
I cannot believe you put an M-80
in Mr. London's mailbox.

03:45.348 --> 03:47.114
That must have been so awesome.

03:47.116 --> 03:49.416
It popped right off the post.
Went like...

03:49.418 --> 03:51.885
at least 10 feet in the air.
It was pretty rad.

03:51.887 --> 03:54.655
Totally rad.

03:54.657 --> 03:57.725
I gotta get going.
I'll catch you in chemistry?

03:57.727 --> 03:59.560
Not if I catch you first.

03:59.562 --> 04:03.964
I mean, uh... see ya.

04:04.966 --> 04:07.134
Someone looks flushed.

04:07.136 --> 04:09.403
So you got the hots
for scruffy, huh?

04:09.405 --> 04:11.338
No. Not really.

04:11.340 --> 04:12.906
I mean, maybe.

04:12.908 --> 04:14.308
Whatever.
So what if I do?

04:14.310 --> 04:15.642
Your sister would never
have the guts

04:15.644 --> 04:19.012
to chase a bad boy,
but... you're different.

04:19.014 --> 04:22.082
And since I'm feeling
oh, so generous,

04:22.084 --> 04:23.850
I'm gonna give you
some free advice.

04:23.852 --> 04:25.018
Who says I need advice?

04:25.020 --> 04:26.653
And why are you so invested
in my dating life?

04:26.655 --> 04:29.122
Wanted to see if my influence
was potent enough

04:29.124 --> 04:31.792
to help you get your man,
but...

04:31.794 --> 04:34.227
you're not interested.

04:34.229 --> 04:36.196
Wait.

04:36.198 --> 04:37.497
I'm interested.

04:37.499 --> 04:39.266
Well, you have two options.

04:39.268 --> 04:42.102
One... you could continue your sad
little hallway flirtation

04:42.104 --> 04:45.172
for another six months
and pray this goes somewhere.

04:45.174 --> 04:46.273
What's option two?

04:46.275 --> 04:48.108
Create a casual,
laid-back situation

04:48.110 --> 04:49.309
where you can get some time
with your boy

04:49.311 --> 04:51.645
outside of these
pathetic halls.

04:51.647 --> 04:55.815
- Like what?
- Hello? Like a <i>party.</i>

04:55.817 --> 04:57.517
He'll show up,
be drunk or stoned

04:57.519 --> 04:59.586
'cause that's what guys
like scruffy do,

04:59.588 --> 05:01.855
and you'll make your move.

05:01.857 --> 05:04.491
Is anybody having
a party this weekend?

05:04.493 --> 05:07.360
Not my problem.
I gave you the advice,

05:07.362 --> 05:09.663
you have to take it
from there.

05:09.665 --> 05:12.532
And please... don't disappoint.

05:12.534 --> 05:15.068
<i>Dorrit was suddenly
feeling the pressure</i>

05:15.070 --> 05:17.003
<i>to make something happen,</i>

05:17.005 --> 05:20.173
<i>while I was staring at</i>
<i>something created by pressure.</i>

05:20.175 --> 05:21.708
What is <i>that?</i>

05:21.710 --> 05:24.577
It's my gargantuanly
scrumptious engagement ring.

05:24.579 --> 05:25.979
You're engaged? To who?

05:25.981 --> 05:28.314
Darling, don't be daft.
To Harlan.

05:28.316 --> 05:31.184
<i>Oh.</i> I thought
that was just, like,

05:31.186 --> 05:33.753
- a sex thing.
- Mm, it is.

05:33.755 --> 05:36.022
But we're also in the throes
of a great love affair...

05:36.024 --> 05:38.925
he with me,
and me with this ring.

05:38.927 --> 05:40.293
Wait, so you don't love him?

05:40.295 --> 05:41.828
<i>J'adore</i> him.

05:41.830 --> 05:43.796
I just love the ring
one tick more.

05:43.798 --> 05:45.498
Well, I'm really happy for you.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.166
Sadly though, it means
my single life

05:47.168 --> 05:48.568
is now at a tragic end.

05:48.570 --> 05:50.470
I'll have to subsist
on tales of

05:50.472 --> 05:52.438
your deliciously
tawdry exploits now.

05:52.440 --> 05:54.273
- I'm sorry to disappoint.
- Oh, right.

05:54.275 --> 05:56.576
You don't have deliciously
tawdry exploits.

05:56.578 --> 05:59.112
What I meant is Sebastian
and I are still together.

05:59.114 --> 06:00.813
Well, in three months
when you are single,

06:00.815 --> 06:02.081
you'll have to dish.

06:02.083 --> 06:04.183
In three months I'll still
be dating Sebastian.

06:04.185 --> 06:06.152
I know long-distance
can be challenging.

06:06.154 --> 06:08.754
Sorry, but the moment
that taut, muscular goldilocks

06:08.756 --> 06:11.324
packed his bags,
that relationship was doomed.

06:11.326 --> 06:13.125
You're wrong about me
and Sebastian.

06:13.127 --> 06:13.708
We're gonna be...

06:13.828 --> 06:15.109
You're gonna be
the exception, yeah.

06:15.229 --> 06:16.329
That's what everyone says.

06:16.331 --> 06:17.563
But first it's
a few missed calls.

06:17.565 --> 06:19.165
Then it's a few
missed weekends.

06:19.167 --> 06:21.534
Then... you're not bothering
to call at all.

06:21.536 --> 06:23.235
Well, that's not gonna be us.

06:23.237 --> 06:26.072
Or worse...
one of you moves for the other.

06:26.074 --> 06:28.040
Why would that be worse?
That would be great.

06:28.042 --> 06:29.909
Mnh-mnh. Moving
puts way too much pressure

06:29.911 --> 06:30.910
on the relationship.

06:30.912 --> 06:32.778
After that, they start
resenting you

06:32.780 --> 06:34.747
for every little thing
that goes wrong.

06:34.749 --> 06:37.016
Ohh.
Next thing you know,

06:37.018 --> 06:38.951
you sleep with their brother,
and they're shouting at you,

06:38.953 --> 06:41.287
"I moved for you!
I moved for you!"

06:41.289 --> 06:44.690
Good God, man. Relax.

06:44.692 --> 06:46.692
Well, both of us are still
in high school,

06:46.694 --> 06:48.394
so I don't think
either one of us

06:48.396 --> 06:50.496
will be moving anywhere
for each other.

06:50.498 --> 06:54.433
So then it's the slow ride into
no relationship for you two.

06:54.435 --> 06:56.201
That's a shame.

06:57.371 --> 06:59.538
Girls!

06:59.540 --> 07:01.240
Come on down!

07:01.242 --> 07:04.042
What's up, dad?
This better be good.

07:04.044 --> 07:06.011
You interrupted me
doing nothing.

07:06.013 --> 07:08.347
Well, I won't keep you long.

07:08.349 --> 07:10.415
I know how much
doing nothing means to you.

07:10.417 --> 07:11.950
But I have been assigned

07:11.952 --> 07:14.553
to a highly confidential case
this weekend.

07:14.555 --> 07:15.988
I mean, Harlan won't give me
many details...

07:15.990 --> 07:18.891
that's how important it is...
but based on the secrecy,

07:18.893 --> 07:21.526
I am thinking
Fortune 500 merger.

07:21.528 --> 07:22.661
That's great.

07:22.663 --> 07:25.430
Yeah. I am officially
back with the big boys.

07:25.432 --> 07:26.865
Still wondering why I'm here.

07:26.867 --> 07:29.768
You are here because by being
put on this case,

07:29.770 --> 07:31.069
I'll be gone all weekend,

07:31.071 --> 07:32.771
which means I'll be leaving
you girls alone in the house

07:32.773 --> 07:34.139
tomorrow night.

07:36.976 --> 07:39.144
Now, Miss Meade
will be checking in,

07:39.146 --> 07:40.679
and I'll have my cell phone
with me, which means

07:40.681 --> 07:42.848
I'll be reachable at all times.

07:42.850 --> 07:44.683
This is a <i>test,</i>

07:44.685 --> 07:47.319
and I expect you to handle it
responsibly.

07:47.321 --> 07:49.354
If not, Miss Meade will be
right across the street

07:49.356 --> 07:50.355
to let me know.

07:50.357 --> 07:52.057
We can handle it, dad.
I promise.

07:52.059 --> 07:53.725
Brownnoser. I'd totally
have a party,

07:53.727 --> 07:55.594
but with Carrie here
to be my buzzkill,

07:55.596 --> 07:56.895
I'll just go to Audrey's.

07:56.897 --> 07:59.831
Fine. I'll probably
see a movie with Mouse.

07:59.833 --> 08:02.100
- Be home early.
- Fun.

08:02.102 --> 08:03.301
Sorry to miss it.

08:03.303 --> 08:05.670
Okay, good. Sounds like
this is gonna work out.

08:05.672 --> 08:07.639
But if you try to pull anything,

08:07.641 --> 08:09.974
- there will be hell to pay.
- Got it.

08:09.976 --> 08:11.509
Hear ya loud and clear.

08:11.511 --> 08:12.977
No funny business.

08:12.979 --> 08:14.712
Sebastian, my dad's
out of town this weekend.

08:14.714 --> 08:16.848
So get your butt
on the next plane.

08:16.850 --> 08:19.350
We have the whole house
to ourselves.

08:19.352 --> 08:22.053
Huge party at my house
tomorrow.

08:22.055 --> 08:25.089
Yeah, tell <i>everyone.</i>

08:27.000 --> 08:33.073

08:34.019 --> 08:35.150
- Hello?
- Hey, Mouse.

08:35.153 --> 08:36.852
Still up for seeing
"Out of Africa" tonight?

08:36.855 --> 08:38.520
Sebastian couldn't make it?

08:38.523 --> 08:39.822
When I finally
got in touch with him,

08:39.823 --> 08:41.357
he said he'd already
told Garret

08:41.359 --> 08:43.793
he'd go on a boating trip
with him this weekend.

08:43.794 --> 08:45.862
It <i>was</i> really short notice.

08:45.864 --> 08:48.831
I guess I just hoped he'd make
a huge romantic gesture

08:48.833 --> 08:51.334
and drop everything
to be with me.

08:51.336 --> 08:53.870
It's been almost a month
since we've seen each other.

08:53.872 --> 08:55.972
It's not like he lives
around the corner.

08:55.974 --> 08:58.341
- Laguna is far.
- I know.

08:58.343 --> 09:00.476
I just...

09:00.478 --> 09:02.745
Larissa kind of got in my head.

09:02.747 --> 09:04.714
Maybe she's right.
Maybe I'll never...

09:04.716 --> 09:06.515
see him again.

09:08.586 --> 09:11.587
That's probably Miss Meade
coming to check in on me.

09:11.589 --> 09:13.956
This is gonna be a fun day.

09:13.958 --> 09:15.958
I'll be right with you.
One sec.

09:17.461 --> 09:18.661
Miss me, Bradshaw?

09:18.663 --> 09:20.563
You came!

09:20.565 --> 09:21.664
Is that Sebastian?

09:21.666 --> 09:25.568
Yeah, bye.

09:25.570 --> 09:27.570
This is the best surprise ever.

09:27.572 --> 09:30.005
<i>And in that moment, I was sure</i>

09:30.007 --> 09:32.441
<i>Larissa knew nothing</i>
<i>about me and Sebastian</i>

09:32.443 --> 09:35.344
<i>and long-distance love.</i>

09:39.650 --> 09:41.283
Hey.

09:41.285 --> 09:42.484
Rager at my house tonight.

09:42.486 --> 09:45.020
- Sweet.
- You should come.

09:46.956 --> 09:49.291
You and your buddy, I mean.

09:49.293 --> 09:50.359
It's gonna be huge.

09:50.361 --> 09:52.961
- Awesome.
- We'll be there.

09:52.963 --> 09:55.130
Okay. Cool.

09:55.132 --> 09:58.667
<i>While Dorrit braced herself</i>
<i>for an exciting evening,</i>

09:58.669 --> 10:01.203
<i>my dad was about to walk into some
excitement of his own.</i>

10:01.205 --> 10:02.638
Hey.

10:02.640 --> 10:04.640
<i>Only, it wasn't the kind</i>
<i>he was expecting.</i>

10:04.642 --> 10:05.741
I'm glad you could make it.

10:05.743 --> 10:07.075
All right, so who's the client?

10:07.077 --> 10:09.177
M.C.I.? P&G?
One of the Ma Bells?

10:09.179 --> 10:11.213
- Me.
- Huh?

10:11.215 --> 10:14.883
<i>And...</i> me.

10:14.885 --> 10:18.253
I... I thought I was here
because of a big merger.

10:18.255 --> 10:19.488
Well, you are.

10:19.490 --> 10:21.723
One between me
and my Nubian Princess.

10:21.725 --> 10:25.627
I'm the princess, and I'm very Nubian.

10:25.629 --> 10:28.830
I'm leaving.

10:28.832 --> 10:31.933
I might be able to get home
in time to watch "Magnum, P.I."

10:31.935 --> 10:33.969
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

10:33.971 --> 10:35.103
Please.

10:35.105 --> 10:36.705
- You gotta do this.
- Do what?

10:36.707 --> 10:38.807
Help us bang out a prenuptial.

10:38.809 --> 10:40.876
I don't practice
that kind of law.

10:40.878 --> 10:43.278
You need a legitimate
unbiased family lawyer

10:43.280 --> 10:45.447
to mediate this.
Not me. Not a friend.

10:45.449 --> 10:48.650
No, Tommy, I need you
<i>because</i> you're my friend.

10:48.652 --> 10:51.753
Look, this woman...

10:51.755 --> 10:54.289
she is under my skin.

10:54.291 --> 10:55.590
I'm head over heels for her.

10:55.592 --> 10:57.659
If you're not here
to protect my interests,

10:57.661 --> 10:59.694
I might give up everything.

11:01.330 --> 11:02.797
Oh, come <i>on.</i>

11:02.799 --> 11:05.400
We'll order dinner in from...
Oh, Shun Lee.

11:05.402 --> 11:07.569
On me.

11:07.571 --> 11:10.238
You double my hourly rate,
you got a deal.

11:11.641 --> 11:13.441
Sold.

11:32.695 --> 11:35.062
I know I said
long-distance was fine,

11:35.064 --> 11:37.532
but honestly,
I missed you so much,

11:37.534 --> 11:40.268
I physically hurt.
I felt the same way.

11:40.270 --> 11:42.236
I didn't want to be
without you anymore.

11:44.873 --> 11:47.975
So your dad wasn't mad
that you missed your boat trip?

11:47.977 --> 11:49.710
No.

11:49.712 --> 11:51.779
He understood how much
I wanted to see you.

11:58.487 --> 12:00.755
How long do you think
you can stay?

12:00.757 --> 12:03.791
I'm not just here
for the weekend, Carrie.

12:03.793 --> 12:05.493
I'm here for good.

12:05.495 --> 12:07.161
I'm moving back.

12:09.364 --> 12:11.132
That's a good thing, right?

12:11.134 --> 12:15.069
Of course. No, that's a...
a great thing.

12:15.071 --> 12:17.171
It's just... wow. I...

12:17.173 --> 12:18.772
I wasn't expecting that.

12:25.347 --> 12:28.582
- Did you hear something?
- No.

12:32.855 --> 12:34.655
Okay, yeah, I heard something.

12:34.657 --> 12:36.724
Oh, no.

12:36.726 --> 12:38.659
I wonder if Dorrit came home.

12:38.661 --> 12:40.294
Hey, when's your dad
coming back?

12:40.296 --> 12:41.662
Hang on.
I'll be right back.

12:41.664 --> 12:43.897
Party! Let's do this!

12:54.809 --> 12:57.010
Brought the booze! Party's on!

12:57.012 --> 12:58.879
Dorrit?!

13:07.965 --> 13:09.274
It turns out Dorrit's home...

13:09.394 --> 13:11.983
along with 15 of
her closest friends.

13:12.103 --> 13:14.603
- Oh, boy.
- I'll be right back.

13:14.605 --> 13:16.972
<i>♪ We ain't gonna take it ♪</i>

13:16.974 --> 13:20.242
<i>♪ no, we're not gonna take it ♪</i>

13:20.244 --> 13:21.677
<i>♪ Anymore</i>

13:21.679 --> 13:23.846
<i>Many words have</i>
<i>many different meanings.</i>

13:23.848 --> 13:26.748
<i>For example... "Rager,"</i>
<i>a slang term for</i>

13:26.750 --> 13:29.451
<i>an out-of-control</i>
<i>house party...</i>

13:29.453 --> 13:31.887
Sorry.

13:31.889 --> 13:35.057
And <i>for the feelings I was</i>
<i>having towards my sister.</i>

13:35.059 --> 13:37.993
So you lied about spending
the night at Audrey's, huh?

13:37.995 --> 13:39.127
Looks like you lied, too.

13:39.129 --> 13:40.395
You weren't even supposed
to be here.

13:40.397 --> 13:42.064
I planned on going
to a movie with Mouse,

13:42.066 --> 13:43.665
and then Sebastian
surprised me and...

13:43.667 --> 13:45.400
that's not the point.

13:45.402 --> 13:47.102
How could you let this happen?

13:47.104 --> 13:48.503
Dad's away.
It's a party.

13:48.505 --> 13:49.738
What's your damage?

13:49.740 --> 13:52.641
My damage is I have Sebastian
waiting for me upstairs

13:52.643 --> 13:55.010
and a beer-fueled apocalypse
happening downstairs.

13:55.012 --> 13:58.287
Have Sebastian come down.
He loves a party.

13:58.407 --> 14:01.716
No. He loves his girlfriend
and wanted <i>time</i> with her...

14:01.718 --> 14:05.086
alone time...
and you're ruining that.

14:05.088 --> 14:06.721
Not much you can do
about that now.

14:06.723 --> 14:08.156
Oh, that's where you're wrong.

14:08.158 --> 14:09.824
This party is <i>finito!</i>

14:09.826 --> 14:11.059
Coming through.
Watch out!

14:11.061 --> 14:12.193
Are you kidding me?

14:12.195 --> 14:13.428
- I got the kegs!
- Yeah.

14:13.430 --> 14:14.896
Good luck with that, dork.

14:14.898 --> 14:18.433
Mark my words, in five minutes,
this place is gonna be empty.

14:18.435 --> 14:22.070
15, 16, 17, 18...
You got it, bro!

14:22.072 --> 14:24.372
19, 20, 21!

14:26.576 --> 14:28.543
Whoo!

14:28.545 --> 14:29.944
Ugh. How did this happen?

14:29.946 --> 14:31.279
- Whoo!
- Yes!

14:31.281 --> 14:32.280
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

14:32.282 --> 14:34.015
- Carrie!
- Oh, Mouse!

14:34.017 --> 14:35.216
What are you doing here?

14:35.218 --> 14:36.651
I was at the diner
when I heard a couple of kids

14:36.653 --> 14:38.453
talking about ordering,
like, ten kegs

14:38.455 --> 14:39.787
to the Bradshaw house.

14:39.789 --> 14:41.556
Oh, no. More kegs?

14:41.558 --> 14:42.991
When they said Dorrit
was having a party,

14:42.993 --> 14:44.759
I ran over here to warn you.

14:44.761 --> 14:46.160
But judging
by the look of things,

14:46.162 --> 14:48.563
- I'm a little late.
- Yeah, just a bit.

14:48.565 --> 14:50.098
Is this totally ruining
your night with...

14:50.100 --> 14:53.134
- Sebastian!
- Hey, Mouse. Long time no see.

14:53.136 --> 14:55.636
Oh!

14:55.638 --> 14:57.605
I know.
So glad you're visiting.

14:57.607 --> 14:59.507
Back for good, actually.

14:59.509 --> 15:01.375
That's amazing

15:01.377 --> 15:03.845
and so exciting for you guys.

15:03.847 --> 15:05.546
Yeah, nothing doing in Cali,

15:05.548 --> 15:08.983
and this feels right...
me and my Bradshaw.

15:08.985 --> 15:10.151
Yeah.

15:10.153 --> 15:12.787
It... it's great he's back,
isn't it?

15:12.789 --> 15:13.988
But right now
I need to focus on

15:13.990 --> 15:16.424
getting these people
ou this house.

15:16.426 --> 15:17.825
Uh, Carrie,
there's no stopping this.

15:17.827 --> 15:19.927
Parties like these... they just
keep growing and growing.

15:19.929 --> 15:21.996
Like <i>mold.</i>

15:23.832 --> 15:25.733
Hey, so let's get outta here...

15:25.735 --> 15:28.703
go to a hotel.
Have some time to ourselves.

15:28.705 --> 15:30.838
Sebastian, I can't leave.

15:30.840 --> 15:31.972
It's only a house party.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.974
It's like a rite of passage
for Dorrit.

15:33.976 --> 15:35.643
Don't you want to be with me?

15:35.645 --> 15:37.978
Of course, but I have to make
sure my house isn't destroyed,

15:37.980 --> 15:40.548
which is looking
more and more likely.

15:40.550 --> 15:43.284
Now if you'll excuse me,
I think someone is trying

15:43.286 --> 15:44.718
to pee in that vase over there.

15:44.720 --> 15:47.555
Hey, you!

15:47.557 --> 15:49.356
You! That's not a bathroom!

15:49.358 --> 15:51.058
<i>As I tried to smooth over</i>

15:51.060 --> 15:54.561
<i>the disaster that had become</i>
<i>my house,</i>

15:54.563 --> 15:56.730
<i>things were going</i>
<i>surprisingly smoothly</i>

15:56.732 --> 15:59.566
<i>between Harlan and Larissa.</i>

15:59.568 --> 16:00.601
Wow.

16:00.603 --> 16:02.836
Dare I say,
we are flying through this.

16:02.838 --> 16:04.938
I told you this would
be painless.

16:04.940 --> 16:07.841
On to clause 38...
Uh, both parties agree

16:07.843 --> 16:11.912
that there will be...

16:11.914 --> 16:13.881
sexual intercourse

16:13.883 --> 16:17.317
every Tuesday, Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday mornings

16:17.319 --> 16:19.319
at 8:30 A.M.

16:19.321 --> 16:21.221
I prefer the term
"Carnal Lovemaking."

16:21.223 --> 16:22.756
And don't forget Sundays
at 5:00 P.M.

16:22.758 --> 16:24.057
Unless the Giants are playing.

16:24.059 --> 16:25.292
Then it should be
after the game,

16:25.294 --> 16:26.526
even if there's overtime.

16:28.596 --> 16:31.131
Okay. I will note it
as such.

16:31.133 --> 16:33.634
Uh, if either party
fails to meet said requirement,

16:33.636 --> 16:34.835
they will be in breach

16:34.837 --> 16:36.870
of the spousal duties
and responsibilities clause.

16:36.872 --> 16:38.672
Perfect.

16:38.674 --> 16:41.875
Swell. Moving on
to clause 39...

16:41.877 --> 16:44.845
In the event that Harlan
commits any act of infidelity,

16:44.847 --> 16:48.682
Larissa will accept
one baby tiger as penance

16:48.684 --> 16:49.716
for his wrongdoing?

16:49.718 --> 16:51.918
Seems equitable.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.887
But wait. You... you know
that Harlan can't actually

16:53.889 --> 16:55.055
buy you a baby...

16:55.057 --> 16:57.257
Uh...

16:57.259 --> 16:59.359
I know people.

17:00.528 --> 17:02.495
All right.
Uh, that concludes

17:02.497 --> 17:04.798
the fidelity portion
of the agreement.

17:04.800 --> 17:08.068
Last up... the division
of marital assets

17:08.069 --> 17:09.202
in the case of divorce.

17:09.204 --> 17:11.538
No matter what happens,
I keep all my Warhols.

17:11.540 --> 17:13.740
Of course. And I get to keep
my race cars.

17:13.742 --> 17:16.675
Mm, goes without saying,
but should be in writing.

17:16.678 --> 17:18.712
I keep my collection
of exotic orchids.

17:18.714 --> 17:20.814
And I keep my international
porn collection.

17:20.816 --> 17:23.415
Oh, uh, I'll miss that
if we break up.

17:23.417 --> 17:25.050
And if we split up,

17:25.053 --> 17:26.653
I get to keep my gorgeous
bachelor pad.

17:26.655 --> 17:28.121
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but...

17:28.123 --> 17:29.856
You're gonna have to move out.

17:29.858 --> 17:31.591
Under no circumstances.

17:31.593 --> 17:33.660
Come again?

17:33.662 --> 17:35.862
But if we divorce,
you want to keep my apartment?

17:35.864 --> 17:37.130
Absolutely not.

17:37.132 --> 17:39.465
I have zero intention
of moving in there at all.

17:39.467 --> 17:41.768
Well, if you think I'm moving
into your loft...

17:41.770 --> 17:44.003
Don't be ridiculous.

17:44.005 --> 17:45.438
Uh, wait...

17:45.440 --> 17:47.273
Are you expecting
that you and Harlan

17:47.275 --> 17:48.841
will get a new place together?

17:48.843 --> 17:51.344
I don't expect us
to live together at all.

17:51.346 --> 17:52.845
Huh?

17:52.847 --> 17:54.113
What do you mean,
not live together?

17:54.115 --> 17:57.183
Isn't that a given?
I mean, you're marrying him.

17:57.185 --> 17:58.985
Not for me, it isn't.

17:58.987 --> 18:00.653
I will not live with him.

18:00.655 --> 18:03.856
What the hell
are you talking about?

18:09.297 --> 18:12.164
Cool party. Sure.
Thanks for coming.

18:12.166 --> 18:14.233
I'm Scott.

18:14.235 --> 18:15.868
Great.

18:15.870 --> 18:17.169
Nick's friend.

18:18.171 --> 18:19.605
You invited us at the diner.

18:19.607 --> 18:22.174
Right. Right.

18:22.176 --> 18:24.210
You here with Nick? He said
he's coming a little later.

18:24.212 --> 18:26.412
Oh. Okay, cool.

18:26.414 --> 18:28.180
So how do you and Nick
know each other?

18:28.182 --> 18:30.549
Uh, we played soccer together
at Davis Middle.

18:30.551 --> 18:32.251
We've been buds ever since.

18:32.253 --> 18:34.186
Oh. Nick's into sports?

18:34.188 --> 18:35.921
Not so much anymore,

18:35.923 --> 18:37.456
unless you consider
partying a sport.

18:37.458 --> 18:38.891
That's the only kind I like.

18:38.893 --> 18:40.059
Who wants to get
all rah-rah over something

18:40.061 --> 18:41.594
that makes you really sweaty?

18:41.596 --> 18:43.762
I run cross-country, so...

18:43.764 --> 18:44.964
Then you're lame.

18:44.966 --> 18:47.900
You say it like it is.

18:47.902 --> 18:50.369
You don't have to talk to me
if it bugs you.

18:50.371 --> 18:52.738
No! I like it. I mean,
I run cross-country,

18:52.740 --> 18:54.473
so it's not really
all rah-rah.

18:54.475 --> 18:56.075
It's more like...

18:56.077 --> 18:57.609
Zoning out while exploring.

18:57.611 --> 18:59.044
It's actually kind of peaceful.

18:59.046 --> 19:01.880
- That sounds nice.
- Plus it keeps my head clear,

19:01.882 --> 19:03.816
which can get...
pretty cloudy

19:03.818 --> 19:06.051
with all my other, uh,
extracurricular activities.

19:08.322 --> 19:10.823
Speaking of cloudy,

19:10.825 --> 19:12.391
here comes Nick
with the party favors.

19:12.393 --> 19:14.359
Hey, Scott.

19:14.361 --> 19:16.461
'Sup, Nick?
Glad you could make it.

19:16.463 --> 19:19.097
Me, too.
Looks like a wild party.

19:19.099 --> 19:20.265
How about we start it off
right?

19:20.267 --> 19:21.733
Brownie?

19:21.735 --> 19:23.568
Sure!

19:27.240 --> 19:29.374
Just to be clear,
these are pot brownies.

19:29.376 --> 19:30.642
No doy, runner boy.

19:30.644 --> 19:32.077
You'll be so destroyed.

19:36.182 --> 19:37.382
Thanks.

19:40.553 --> 19:42.754
- Holy crap.
- What's up?

19:42.756 --> 19:44.556
Nothing. Be right back.
Don't move.

19:52.799 --> 19:54.432
There you are.

19:54.434 --> 19:55.800
Yep, here I am.

19:55.802 --> 19:58.003
Oh, man. I think
I'm gonna be sick.

19:58.005 --> 19:59.271
Ugh!

19:59.273 --> 20:02.741
Dealing with the vomitorium
that has become my home.

20:04.945 --> 20:08.079
Look... I'm sorry I couldn't
make tonight work.

20:08.081 --> 20:11.516
- I missed you.
- I know. I've missed you, too.

20:11.518 --> 20:13.718
But since you're back,
there's no need to rush.

20:13.720 --> 20:14.652
We've got time together.

20:14.654 --> 20:17.789
Yeah, but... hey.

20:17.791 --> 20:19.958
Is something bothering you?

20:19.960 --> 20:22.093
- No...
- Carrie?

20:22.095 --> 20:25.797
We have a problem.
Miss Meade is here.

20:30.746 --> 20:33.809
<i>♪ Now we rock</i>
<i>the party and come correct ♪</i>

20:33.811 --> 20:35.444

- Oh.

20:43.004 --> 20:46.672
Hi. Um...
I-I like your cardigan.

20:46.674 --> 20:49.174
Oh. Oh, don't you
"Hi" me.

20:49.176 --> 20:51.510
Your father leaves you alone
for one night,

20:51.512 --> 20:52.544
and you go and do this.

20:52.546 --> 20:55.013
You girls are in
so much trouble.

20:55.015 --> 20:56.515
It's not what
it looks like.

20:56.517 --> 20:59.485
- Well, it looks like a party.
- Well, that's actually true.

20:59.487 --> 21:00.586
- Mom?
- But if you just listen to us

21:00.588 --> 21:02.721
- for one second.
- Listen to <i>you?</i> Why?

21:02.723 --> 21:04.189
We can explain.

21:04.191 --> 21:05.657
Oh, you'll be doing
all your explaining

21:05.659 --> 21:07.125
to your father.

21:07.127 --> 21:09.928
Young man?
Stay away from that.

21:11.999 --> 21:14.132
- Come on, Mouse.
-  - Come on, Mouse. You can do it!

21:14.134 --> 21:15.567
The greatest...

21:17.571 --> 21:19.571
Nice playin', Mouse!

21:19.573 --> 21:21.373
You ain't seen nothing yet!

21:21.375 --> 21:22.708
Oh, I'm gonna come back here

21:22.710 --> 21:26.778
and take you all
one-by-one.

21:26.780 --> 21:28.413
You must be <i>crushed.</i>

21:28.415 --> 21:30.015
Drinking at a party
instead of competing

21:30.017 --> 21:31.917
for a spot
at an Ivy League School?

21:31.919 --> 21:35.153
Actually, I found
something else to compete in.

21:35.155 --> 21:37.522
Beer pong...
and I kick ass at it.

21:37.524 --> 21:40.659
It's all about calculating
the angle of the shot.

21:44.731 --> 21:46.564
You seem weirdly happy, too.

21:46.566 --> 21:48.400
Decide to go back
for sloppy seconds

21:48.402 --> 21:50.802
with one of your pretty boy
Castlebury bachelors?

21:50.804 --> 21:52.404
Haven't even flirted.

21:52.406 --> 21:53.905
And I feel great.

21:53.907 --> 21:56.741
I would actually say
I'm having a really good time.

21:56.743 --> 21:59.344
With no man to put
your claws into?

21:59.346 --> 22:00.879
I'm as surprised as you are.

22:00.881 --> 22:02.614
I watched two girls
get into a catfight,

22:02.616 --> 22:06.151
and I talked to the Jens
and I actually listened.

22:06.153 --> 22:09.621
Did you know they have, like,
thoughts and feelings?

22:10.991 --> 22:14.559
- That part was totally boring.
- Yes.

22:14.561 --> 22:16.461
I'd imagine with the Jens,
that really would be.

22:16.463 --> 22:18.596
- Mm.
- Well...

22:18.598 --> 22:20.898
I better get back to being
a beer pong champion.

22:20.900 --> 22:22.934
Please, champion?

22:22.936 --> 22:24.135
Clearly, you've never
had me across the table

22:24.137 --> 22:26.471
as your competition.
I would <i>decimate</i> you.

22:26.473 --> 22:28.339
Bring it, Bimbo.

22:28.341 --> 22:29.607
Oh, I will.

22:29.609 --> 22:31.009
<i>While a competition</i>
<i>was heating up</i>

22:31.011 --> 22:32.643
<i>between Mouse and Donna...</i>

22:32.645 --> 22:34.879
<i>Dorrit and I
were trying to dial Miss Meade down</i>

22:34.881 --> 22:36.647
<i>to a simmer.</i>

22:36.649 --> 22:38.750
I've called three times
and still no answer.

22:38.752 --> 22:41.519
Well, he's bound
to pick up sooner or later.

22:41.521 --> 22:43.020
Why isn't my phone working?

22:43.022 --> 22:44.455
Terrible reception
this high up.

22:44.457 --> 22:45.490
Besides, Tommy,

22:45.492 --> 22:47.925
I need your full focus
and attention.

22:47.927 --> 22:49.861
Can you please do what I asked?

22:49.863 --> 22:51.028
<i>This</i> is important.

22:51.030 --> 22:54.031
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:54.033 --> 22:57.435
Larissa?

22:58.971 --> 23:01.639
Harlan wants you to know
that he'll only be

23:01.641 --> 23:03.841
speaking to you through me now.

23:03.843 --> 23:05.810
Well, you tell Harlan

23:05.812 --> 23:07.378
that there's nothing left
to talk about.

23:07.380 --> 23:09.914
I'm not moving.

23:09.916 --> 23:11.315
Harlan, Larissa says th...

23:11.317 --> 23:13.184
Oh, God, you know what?
No, this is ridiculous.

23:13.186 --> 23:15.252
You two are acting
like children.

23:15.254 --> 23:16.287
She started it.

23:16.289 --> 23:17.621
- Did not.
- Did, too.

23:17.623 --> 23:18.923
Enough!

23:18.925 --> 23:21.025
Harlan, I need to have
a moment alone with Larissa.

23:21.027 --> 23:21.959
Please leave.

23:21.961 --> 23:23.794
- What... I-I could...
- Now.

23:23.796 --> 23:25.663
Fine.

23:29.769 --> 23:32.303
Is everything okay?
Who's the old lady?

23:32.305 --> 23:33.370
Our nosy neighbor

23:33.372 --> 23:34.938
who's totally gonna
bust our asses.

23:34.940 --> 23:36.206
We're doomed.

23:36.208 --> 23:37.241
Excuse me.

23:37.243 --> 23:39.476
Oh. Excuse me,
young man.

23:39.478 --> 23:40.577
Who are you?

23:40.579 --> 23:42.880
I'm one of the few people
that the girls

23:42.882 --> 23:44.815
actually invited over tonight.

23:44.817 --> 23:47.050
I think they're embarrassed
to admit

23:47.052 --> 23:48.919
that this totally
got out of hand.

23:48.921 --> 23:50.354
The girls just wanted to invite

23:50.356 --> 23:52.322
- a couple friends over.
- Oh. A couple of friends.

23:52.324 --> 23:53.991
You see,
when one of Dorrit's friends

23:53.993 --> 23:55.893
found out that her dad
was out of town,

23:55.895 --> 23:57.561
they told
some of their friends,

23:57.563 --> 23:58.829
and word spread.

23:58.831 --> 24:00.130
You know how it is.

24:00.132 --> 24:03.934
High schoolers
can be <i>so</i> selfish.

24:03.936 --> 24:05.502
<i>♪ I'm a nuclear boy ♪</i>

24:05.504 --> 24:07.537
We were just gonna
have people over

24:07.539 --> 24:08.772
to watch "Star Search."

24:08.774 --> 24:10.807
Oh, I love "Star Search."

24:10.809 --> 24:12.442
We do, too, but then all
these people showed up,

24:12.444 --> 24:14.611
and when we asked them to leave,
they wouldn't.

24:14.613 --> 24:17.447
It was peer pressure,
Miss Meade.

24:17.449 --> 24:19.516
Peer pressure.

24:19.518 --> 24:20.584
Total peer pressure.

24:20.586 --> 24:23.987
Kids can be so cruel...

24:23.989 --> 24:26.123
Teasing you,
putting itching powder

24:26.125 --> 24:28.558
in your bra during gym class,

24:28.560 --> 24:30.160
standing you up on prom night,

24:30.162 --> 24:32.128
after I bought
the perfect dress.

24:32.130 --> 24:34.498
And instead, I end up
in my living room,

24:34.500 --> 24:37.000
dancing with my dad.

24:37.002 --> 24:39.236
That's very specific.

24:39.238 --> 24:41.271
But yes.

24:41.273 --> 24:43.139
I know what we should do.

24:43.141 --> 24:44.074
We'll call the police.

24:44.076 --> 24:46.309
No!

24:46.311 --> 24:49.079
Uh, that would just make things
worse for us.

24:49.081 --> 24:50.580
I-if we kick everyone out
like that,

24:50.582 --> 24:51.848
we'll be forever known
as the losers

24:51.850 --> 24:53.216
who couldn't handle
a fun party.

24:53.218 --> 24:56.152
Oh, you poor girls.
This is just awful.

24:56.154 --> 24:58.721
I feel for you.

24:58.723 --> 25:00.123
Oh, no.
Uh, Missus...

25:00.125 --> 25:01.724
Oh, it's Miss.

25:01.726 --> 25:04.060
I never married.
I wanted to.

25:04.062 --> 25:06.296
Never happened.

25:06.298 --> 25:08.064
Oh, I'm... I'm really sorry.

25:08.066 --> 25:09.399
That must be hard.

25:09.401 --> 25:10.600
It is.

25:10.602 --> 25:13.303
Thank you for being
so understanding.

25:13.305 --> 25:15.104
You're very nice girls.

25:15.106 --> 25:16.806
We try to be.

25:16.808 --> 25:17.974
And now...

25:17.976 --> 25:21.477
I'd like to help you.
Let me play the heavy.

25:21.479 --> 25:24.947
I'll clear these kids out,
one at a time,

25:24.949 --> 25:26.949
and you won't be to blame.

25:26.951 --> 25:29.786
Thank you... so much,
Miss Meade.

25:29.788 --> 25:31.521
You really get it.

25:31.523 --> 25:35.324
I do, don't I?
Now...

25:35.326 --> 25:37.126
Hey, you!

25:41.166 --> 25:43.099
Keep an eye on her.

25:45.103 --> 25:47.503
I cannot believe
she ate a whole brownie.

25:47.505 --> 25:48.804
She is gonna be down
for the count

25:48.806 --> 25:50.339
in about 20 minutes.

25:50.341 --> 25:52.375
Awesome!

25:52.377 --> 25:55.745
Um, do you wanna play
quarters or something?

25:55.747 --> 25:56.912
Cool.

25:56.914 --> 25:58.514
Give us a minute?

25:58.516 --> 25:59.915
<i>♪ Boy</i>

25:59.917 --> 26:03.019
uh, I'll go get some beers.

26:03.021 --> 26:05.688
I don't wanna ruin
what is clearly going well

26:05.690 --> 26:08.023
for you with cute and nice
over there,

26:08.025 --> 26:09.492
but I thought that
flock of seagulls boy

26:09.494 --> 26:12.761
with the grouchy attitude
was more your speed.

26:12.763 --> 26:13.829
He is.

26:13.831 --> 26:15.130
Scott's a friend.

26:15.132 --> 26:16.832
Oh, your boy didn't show, huh?

26:16.834 --> 26:18.033
No, he did.

26:18.035 --> 26:19.935
And you're wasting your time,
not to mention

26:19.937 --> 26:22.771
destroying your house,
so you can hang with a friend?

26:22.773 --> 26:25.241
Oh, you disappoint me.

26:25.243 --> 26:26.675
Have I taught you nothing?

26:26.677 --> 26:30.079
I'm taking my time.
Finding the right moment.

26:30.081 --> 26:31.614
People who wait
for the right moment

26:31.616 --> 26:33.615
end up waiting forever.

26:33.617 --> 26:35.150
With a party this crazy...

26:35.152 --> 26:37.853
Ain't gonna last
too much longer.

26:37.855 --> 26:40.456
I'm guessing the cops show
within the next hour.

26:40.458 --> 26:42.124
- So...
-  I'd get busy.

26:42.126 --> 26:43.392
On it.

26:43.394 --> 26:45.027
Make me proud.

26:45.029 --> 26:46.328
And when it's over,
I want details.

26:46.330 --> 26:48.330
I will be out back
playing beer pong with Mouse.

26:49.699 --> 26:50.966
I'm sorry, what?

26:50.968 --> 26:53.035
Don't ask.

26:53.037 --> 26:54.503
How'd you even know I was here?

26:54.505 --> 26:56.004
You're so uninterested
in my life,

26:56.006 --> 26:57.606
I'm surprised you knew
where to look.

26:57.608 --> 26:59.608
Your father filled me in
on everything.

26:59.610 --> 27:01.777
The two of you
have one little tiff,

27:01.779 --> 27:02.744
and you run away?

27:02.746 --> 27:04.413
You have to go back tomorrow.

27:04.415 --> 27:05.647
I'm not living
with him anymore.

27:05.649 --> 27:06.815
Not after what happened.

27:06.817 --> 27:07.883
Here we go!

27:07.885 --> 27:10.218
The two of you love drama,
don't you?

27:10.220 --> 27:12.421
It's why I couldn't
stay married to him.

27:12.423 --> 27:14.089
I can't do drama.

27:14.091 --> 27:15.490
I need a peaceful home.

27:15.492 --> 27:18.293
Which is why <i>you</i> cannot
come live with me.

27:18.295 --> 27:19.895
<i>That</i> was never the plan.

27:19.897 --> 27:22.430
You... you think I would ever
live with you

27:22.432 --> 27:24.432
and that boyfriend of yours?

27:24.434 --> 27:25.500
Husband!

27:25.502 --> 27:27.402
Lucas and I are <i>married.</i>

27:27.404 --> 27:28.770
Fine, mom.

27:28.772 --> 27:31.139
Either way, I was never
gonna live with you. Ever.

27:31.141 --> 27:33.475
So where exactly do you
think you'll be living?

27:33.477 --> 27:34.509
What are you gonna do?

27:34.511 --> 27:35.911
Move in with
your little girlfriend?

27:35.913 --> 27:38.413
It's none of your business.

27:38.415 --> 27:39.714
As usual.

27:39.716 --> 27:42.350
Just like your father,
you have no plan.

27:42.352 --> 27:44.919
Just flying by
the seat of your pants.

27:44.921 --> 27:46.621
Well, that isn't gonna
work for me.

27:46.623 --> 27:47.922
Come Sunday,

27:47.924 --> 27:50.425
you are getting on a plane
and going back to your dad.

27:50.427 --> 27:51.726
I will not.

27:51.728 --> 27:53.294
I'm 18 years old,
and you can't control

27:53.296 --> 27:54.596
what I choose to do anymore.

27:54.598 --> 27:56.831
And based on what a terrific
parent you've been,

27:56.833 --> 27:59.000
I don't see why I should
take orders from you.

27:59.002 --> 28:01.302
I'm done here.

28:03.340 --> 28:06.174
You're Carrie, right?
The girlfriend?

28:06.176 --> 28:07.208
Yeah.

28:07.210 --> 28:10.278
Well, good luck with him.

28:10.280 --> 28:12.447
He's all yours.

28:15.751 --> 28:17.819
<i>Suddenly,</i>
<i>I realized that Sebastian</i>

28:17.821 --> 28:19.687
<i>was a pressure cooker.</i>

28:19.689 --> 28:21.856
<i>I just hoped he wouldn't blow.</i>

28:21.858 --> 28:23.357
I'm gettin' it, dude!

28:23.359 --> 28:25.193
No, dude, dude,
you can't keep doing that.

28:25.195 --> 28:28.162
- No, man, hey, stop.
- You gotta let go.

28:28.164 --> 28:30.064
- You can't do that!
- Come on. Ohh!

28:30.066 --> 28:31.132
Oh, no!

28:31.134 --> 28:32.366
- Ohh!
- Aah!

28:38.808 --> 28:41.676
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>something else did.</i>

28:45.833 --> 28:48.388
My dad's latest bimbo
hit on me.

28:48.508 --> 28:50.908
And yesterday, when I told him,

28:50.910 --> 28:52.943
she lied and said
I came on to her.

28:52.945 --> 28:55.412
Of course, Garret believes her

28:55.414 --> 28:57.248
because he's known her
for two whole minutes,

28:57.250 --> 28:59.650
and she's got fake double D's.

28:59.652 --> 29:01.452
I'm just his son.

29:01.454 --> 29:04.755
Why didn't you tell me
in the first place?

29:04.757 --> 29:06.123
That I'm an idiot?

29:06.125 --> 29:08.158
That I moved to Laguna
thinking I might

29:08.160 --> 29:11.628
actually have one parent
who cared about me?

29:11.630 --> 29:13.497
That doesn't make you an idiot.

29:15.101 --> 29:17.801
Sometimes I just wanna
kill Garret.

29:17.803 --> 29:20.504
Why does he keep
doing this to you?

29:20.506 --> 29:23.040
Because he's never
gonna change.

29:23.042 --> 29:25.175
That's why I had
to get out of there.

29:25.177 --> 29:29.413
The only place I wanted
to be was... with you.

29:32.250 --> 29:34.618
In a way, I'm relieved

29:34.620 --> 29:36.520
to know that you
didn't move back

29:36.522 --> 29:38.188
only because of me.

29:38.190 --> 29:42.726
That pressure freaked me out.

29:42.728 --> 29:44.928
I kinda sensed that.

29:44.930 --> 29:47.764
I'm not so good
at hiding my feelings.

29:47.766 --> 29:49.166
And you shouldn't.

29:49.168 --> 29:50.300
I always wanna know
what's going on

29:50.302 --> 29:51.568
in that head of yours.

29:51.570 --> 29:54.971
Even if it's hard for me
to say,

29:54.973 --> 29:57.407
or hard for you to hear?

29:57.409 --> 30:00.811
Even if.

30:05.716 --> 30:08.985
I feel like, every time
something goes wrong,

30:08.987 --> 30:10.720
I'm the person you lean on.

30:10.722 --> 30:13.790
And I'm glad that you
feel like you can.

30:13.792 --> 30:17.494
You always should
when you need to.

30:17.496 --> 30:20.030
But sometimes I feel like
that can be

30:20.032 --> 30:24.300
a lot for me, for us.

30:26.270 --> 30:29.539
I can't always put stuff aside
to be there for you.

30:29.541 --> 30:33.443
I know that,
and I don't want you to,

30:33.445 --> 30:35.311
especially on a night
like tonight,

30:35.313 --> 30:36.846
when you're dealing
with the party from hell.

30:37.816 --> 30:39.115
It really is, isn't it?

30:39.117 --> 30:43.119
Oh, this one is going down
in Castlebury history.

30:43.121 --> 30:44.520
That's what I was afraid of.

30:46.958 --> 30:48.057
I gotta go do something.

30:48.059 --> 30:49.826
Where you going?

30:50.828 --> 30:53.563
To take some of
the pressure off of you.

30:58.001 --> 31:01.504
Larissa, I have known you
to be an interesting,

31:01.506 --> 31:04.574
intelligent...
strange woman,

31:04.576 --> 31:06.952
who has had a wonderful
influence on my daughter,

31:07.072 --> 31:09.828
which is why this is all
so confusing for me.

31:09.948 --> 31:13.282
Isn't part of being married
about living with the person

31:13.284 --> 31:15.117
that you're going to
spend your life with?

31:15.119 --> 31:17.587
I mean, why won't you
move in with Harlan?

31:17.589 --> 31:20.523
I don't wanna live with him
because I'm afraid

31:20.525 --> 31:22.792
if I move in,
I'll become a person

31:22.794 --> 31:25.127
who has nothing
of herself left,

31:25.129 --> 31:26.329
and that scares me.

31:26.331 --> 31:27.563
Wait, but what do you mean?

31:27.565 --> 31:30.433
Moving in doesn't mean
you become less you.

31:30.435 --> 31:32.935
And yet it does.

31:32.937 --> 31:34.837
Because before long,
you dissolve

31:34.839 --> 31:36.972
into the relationship.

31:36.974 --> 31:39.141
First, you give up your place.

31:39.143 --> 31:41.844
Then you start
giving up your taste, hmm?

31:41.846 --> 31:47.449
Compromising on furniture,
clothes, where you eat.

31:47.451 --> 31:50.319
Then one day you're just
an appendage to someone else...

31:50.321 --> 31:52.555
No thoughts and no life
of your own.

31:54.324 --> 31:57.293
I feel like without a space
that is just mine,

31:57.295 --> 31:58.927
I'll disappear.

32:02.465 --> 32:03.966
Okay.

32:03.968 --> 32:05.834
Okay, then I think
I have a solution.

32:05.836 --> 32:07.636
All right? Harlan.

32:11.875 --> 32:14.243
Larissa is afraid...

32:14.245 --> 32:16.311
that if she moves in with you,

32:16.313 --> 32:20.582
she will lose everything
that makes her life special.

32:21.484 --> 32:24.219
Sweetie, I mean, I had no idea.

32:24.221 --> 32:25.787
I mean...

32:25.789 --> 32:30.158
I always want you to have
this big, spectacular life,

32:30.160 --> 32:32.461
right down to all those
knickknacks and tchotchkes

32:32.463 --> 32:34.029
you like to keep at your place.

32:34.031 --> 32:36.965
Good, then you won't mind
buying her her own apartment

32:36.967 --> 32:38.133
in your building.

32:41.571 --> 32:43.271
Seems like the perfect excuse

32:43.273 --> 32:45.140
to buy out my jerk
of a next door neighbor.

32:45.142 --> 32:48.577
I mean, we could even
put a-a door in to attach

32:48.579 --> 32:50.512
our two places.

32:50.514 --> 32:51.613
Baby, what do you say?

32:51.615 --> 32:53.849
I say give me the decorator
of my choice,

32:53.851 --> 32:56.384
with an unlimited budget,
and it sounds divine!

32:56.386 --> 32:58.153
All right, it's settled! Yes,
we figured it out!

33:00.557 --> 33:02.857
I am so happy to be
marrying you,

33:02.859 --> 33:04.226
my feral little minx.

33:04.228 --> 33:05.393
Mmm...

33:09.232 --> 33:10.732
I'm... I'm
a... I'm gonna be...

33:10.734 --> 33:12.067
going home now.

33:12.069 --> 33:15.070
Oh, nonsense!
It's 3:00 A.M.!

33:15.072 --> 33:17.639
You have your own suite
across the hall.

33:17.641 --> 33:20.742
Keys on the table,
room service on me.

33:20.744 --> 33:22.844
All right,
well, you two enjoy yourselves.

33:22.846 --> 33:24.979
I'm just... I'm gonna...
I'll be in my room,

33:24.981 --> 33:28.683
which is way over here,
way far, far away.

33:28.685 --> 33:29.784
You might still...

33:29.786 --> 33:30.919
Wanna find some earplugs.

33:30.921 --> 33:32.620
Oh!

33:32.622 --> 33:34.355
Aah!

33:36.960 --> 33:39.260
Hey, there you are.
I've been looking for ya.

33:39.262 --> 33:41.930
You wanna play quarters?

33:43.433 --> 33:45.933
I've got a better idea.

34:02.151 --> 34:03.451
Cops are coming!

34:03.453 --> 34:05.119
- Everybody run!
-  What?

34:05.121 --> 34:06.254
Everybody run!

34:06.256 --> 34:08.723
Get out of here!
They're gonna bust us!

34:08.725 --> 34:09.790
Get out of here!

34:09.792 --> 34:12.426
Come on, get out
while you still can! Run!

34:14.197 --> 34:15.563
I guess I should go.

34:15.565 --> 34:17.531
No, you don't.
You're coming with me.

34:17.533 --> 34:19.467
Come on, people! Go!

34:20.536 --> 34:22.003
Now the cops are coming?

34:22.005 --> 34:24.505
Perfect. My dad is going
to murder us.

34:24.507 --> 34:25.906
No cops. I made it up.

34:25.908 --> 34:28.809
Oh, thank you.

34:31.313 --> 34:32.780
I believe these are yours.

34:32.782 --> 34:37.751
I love these sunglasses.

34:44.460 --> 34:46.092
So what should we do now?

34:46.094 --> 34:48.661
Well, we don't have
to do anything.

34:48.664 --> 34:51.065
We can clean this all up later.

34:51.067 --> 34:53.734
Well, since we're not
cleaning up until later,

34:53.735 --> 34:56.704
I have a couple thoughts on what
we <i>could</i> do right now.

34:56.706 --> 34:58.672
Oh, you do?

34:59.574 --> 35:02.209
Come on, Kydd.
Let's go upstairs.

35:02.211 --> 35:04.478
Oh, right this second?

35:04.480 --> 35:06.046
Look who's putting
the pressure on now.

35:06.048 --> 35:08.715
I think you can handle it.

35:20.075 --> 35:25.245
<i>The morning after</i>
<i>a big bash can be exciting...</i>

35:28.015 --> 35:31.217
<i>or surprising.</i>

35:32.853 --> 35:34.454
What's the rush?

35:34.456 --> 35:35.855
Oh, I gotta go.

35:35.857 --> 35:38.491
If my girlfriend finds out,
she'll totally dump me.

35:38.493 --> 35:41.127
You have a girlfriend?

35:41.129 --> 35:42.862
Yeah. I thought you knew.

35:42.864 --> 35:44.697
I did not.

35:44.699 --> 35:45.932
Oh.

35:45.934 --> 35:47.500
You're such a jerk.

35:47.502 --> 35:49.736
Get the hell outta here.

35:54.675 --> 35:59.512
<i>It can also create</i>
<i>strange bedfellows.</i>

36:07.087 --> 36:08.254
This never happened.

36:08.256 --> 36:10.356
Agreed.

36:10.358 --> 36:13.226
But you're kind of
a good snuggler.

36:13.228 --> 36:15.628
You, too.

36:22.537 --> 36:24.770
I was wondering where you were.

36:24.772 --> 36:26.806
Just figured I'd get
a jump start on the day,

36:26.808 --> 36:29.842
clean up, take some things
off your plate.

36:29.844 --> 36:31.777
I made some coffee.

36:31.779 --> 36:34.513
Thank you.

36:34.515 --> 36:36.282
I also called my dad
this morning.

36:36.284 --> 36:37.483
We talked it out.

36:37.485 --> 36:39.952
Okay. Are you going back?

36:39.954 --> 36:42.121
No,
we both agreed that our relationship

36:42.123 --> 36:44.123
probably works better
long distance.

36:44.125 --> 36:46.659
He's gonna give me an allowance

36:46.661 --> 36:48.093
to find a place in Manhattan,

36:48.095 --> 36:49.128
so I can put down roots.

36:49.130 --> 36:51.530
That's so great! Yay!

36:51.532 --> 36:53.799
Carrie, that was dad
on the phone.

36:53.801 --> 36:55.201
He's coming back in an hour.

37:05.111 --> 37:06.478
We've got work to do.

37:06.480 --> 37:08.881

38:12.346 --> 38:13.545
I'm gonna go return the kegs.

38:13.547 --> 38:14.646
See you later?

38:14.648 --> 38:16.247
You bet.

38:24.256 --> 38:25.423
Girls?

38:27.561 --> 38:29.461
You here?

38:29.463 --> 38:30.528
Hey.

38:30.530 --> 38:32.597
Ah.

38:32.599 --> 38:34.232
How was your night?

38:34.234 --> 38:36.935
Uh, it was, you know,
pretty boring.

38:36.937 --> 38:39.170
Yep. Nothing much
to talk about.

38:39.172 --> 38:40.939
I'm relieved.

38:40.941 --> 38:42.006
I was worried I'd come home

38:42.008 --> 38:43.174
and the house
would be destroyed.

38:44.778 --> 38:47.011
I can't believe you would
think that of us, dad.

38:47.013 --> 38:48.947
Really, I'm insulted.

38:56.488 --> 38:57.889
Girls?

38:57.891 --> 38:59.490
Hi, Tom.

39:03.762 --> 39:06.397
The woman just fell
out of the cupboard?

39:06.399 --> 39:07.865
What did you tell your dad?

39:07.867 --> 39:09.267
Well, Miss Meade
was so embarrassed

39:09.269 --> 39:10.968
that she lied and told my dad

39:10.970 --> 39:13.638
she must've sleepwalked
over to our place.

39:13.640 --> 39:14.972
We did leave her
with a spare key.

39:14.974 --> 39:18.042
Which he took back that day.

39:18.044 --> 39:20.378
So... what do you think
about the flat?

39:20.380 --> 39:21.579
I do hope you'll take it.

39:21.581 --> 39:24.582
I dread the thought
of strangers in my space.

39:24.584 --> 39:27.218
It's a bummer
you have to give it up.

39:27.220 --> 39:29.320
Darling, I'm not.
I'm subletting it,

39:29.322 --> 39:30.988
in case it doesn't work out.

39:30.990 --> 39:31.989
Don't tell Harlan.
