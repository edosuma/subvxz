IT'S GIVING ME CHILD SUPPORT.

09:33.533 --> 09:34.700
IT'S A CONSORTIUM OF DOCTORS.

09:34.733 --> 09:36.833
I SET UP THE QUICKBOOKS SYSTEM
FOR THEM,

09:36.867 --> 09:38.200
AND I RUN THEIR
BILLING FOR THEM.

09:38.233 --> 09:39.433
AND IS THAT PRETTY MUCH
9:00 TO 5:00?

09:39.467 --> 09:40.767
MORE LIKE 7:00 TO 11:00.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.933
IT'S PRETTY INTENSE
BECAUSE, WELL,

09:42.967 --> 09:44.300
PATIENTS DON'T WANT TO PAY
THEIR DOCTOR'S BILLS.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.067
OH, YEAH.

09:46.100 --> 09:47.467
YEAH.

09:47.500 --> 09:49.100
SO, EWAN,
IF IT'S NOT TOO PERSONAL,

09:49.133 --> 09:50.900
DO YOU
HAVE A GIRLFRIEND,

09:50.933 --> 09:52.067
A BOYFRIEND?

09:52.067 --> 09:53.100
WELL, I HAD
A BOYFRIEND,

09:53.133 --> 09:55.567
BUT WE BROKE UP
NINE MONTHS AGO.

09:55.600 --> 09:56.800
IT WAS PRETTY MUTUAL,

09:56.833 --> 09:59.800
BUT IT WAS STILL
KIND OF A ROUGH TIME.

09:59.833 --> 10:02.733
SORRY.

10:02.767 --> 10:05.467
I AM STARTING TO DATE AGAIN.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.933
YAY.

10:10.267 --> 10:14.267
WHAT KIND OF MUSIC
DO YOU LIKE?

10:14.300 --> 10:17.400
WELL, MOSTLY I LISTEN
TO R AND B AND FUNK--

10:17.433 --> 10:19.733
SLY STONE,
CHAKA KHAN, PRINCE...

10:19.767 --> 10:20.800
BUT I'VE GOT NO PROBLEM
WEARING HEADPHONES

10:20.833 --> 10:22.067
IF YOU'RE NOT INTO IT.

10:22.100 --> 10:23.533
NO, NO,
PRINCE IS EXCELLENT.

10:23.567 --> 10:25.433
ESPECIALLY WITH THE REVOLUTION.

10:25.467 --> 10:26.600
YEAH, WITH WENDY AND LISA.

10:26.633 --> 10:27.600
YES.

10:27.633 --> 10:29.067
I LOVE
WENDY AND LISA.

10:29.100 --> 10:30.933
THAT'S HIS BEST SHIT,
HANDS DOWN.

10:30.967 --> 10:32.767
FUCK IT. LET'S JUST
SHOW EWAN THE STUDIO.

10:32.800 --> 10:33.733
YEAH, FUCK IT.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.033
THERE'S
JUST ONE THING

10:35.067 --> 10:36.067
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE OKAY WITH.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.733
IT'S NOT REALLY A BIG DEAL.

10:37.767 --> 10:38.833
LAY IT ON US, EWAN.

10:38.867 --> 10:39.833
WELL, I JUST
WANT YOU TO KNOW

10:39.867 --> 10:42.000
THAT SOMETIMES
I'M GOING TO BE NAKED.

10:43.767 --> 10:45.500
UH, YEAH. YEAH.

10:45.533 --> 10:47.567
I MEAN,
WHEN YOU'RE HAVING A SHOWER,

10:47.600 --> 10:50.133
OR, LIKE, WHAT?

10:50.167 --> 10:51.633
GETTING CHANGED.

10:51.667 --> 10:52.900
YEAH, L.A. IN THE SUMMER
IS A KILLER.

10:52.933 --> 10:54.467
EVERYONE SLEEPS NAKED.
YEAH. YEAH, TOTALLY.

10:54.500 --> 10:55.900
AND SOMETIMES, LIKE,
YOU KNOW,

10:55.933 --> 10:58.333
LIKE,
HANGING AROUND THE HOUSE TOO.

10:58.367 --> 11:00.433
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:00.467 --> 11:01.800
WELL, YOU KNOW, LIKE,
DOING DAY-TO-DAY THINGS,

11:01.833 --> 11:05.167
LIKE DUSTING, GARDENING,
READING THE PAPER,

11:05.200 --> 11:07.167
COOKING BREAKFAST.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.300
BASICALLY,
I'M A NUDIST.

11:08.333 --> 11:09.800
IT'S A LIFESTYLE THING,

11:09.833 --> 11:10.800
BUT IT'S SO NATURAL.

11:10.833 --> 11:12.333
AFTER A WHILE,
YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.

11:12.367 --> 11:14.333
DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT,
EWAN?

11:14.367 --> 11:15.333
OH, YEAH, SURE.

11:15.367 --> 11:16.367
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

11:16.400 --> 11:17.533
IF I TOOK MY SHOES OFF,
AND MY SHIRT,

11:17.567 --> 11:19.700
IT'S WOULDN'T BE
A BIG DEAL, RIGHT?

11:19.733 --> 11:21.133
SO, WHAT IF I TAKE IT

11:21.167 --> 11:22.800
ONE MORE STEP FURTHER?

11:22.833 --> 11:24.133
THAT'S NO BIG DEAL, RIGHT?

11:24.167 --> 11:25.133
OH, MY GOD!

11:25.167 --> 11:26.500
NO, EWAN.

11:26.533 --> 11:28.067
I RECOMMEND
WE SET UP A SCHEDULE

11:28.067 --> 11:30.167
FOR BATHING, COOKING,
CLEANING...

11:30.200 --> 11:31.900
AND I THINK IT WOULD BE
REALLY, REALLY BONDING

11:31.933 --> 11:33.133
IF, ONCE A WEEK,

11:33.167 --> 11:34.367
WE EACH MADE A MEAL
FOR THE OTHER TWO.

11:34.400 --> 11:35.467
MY SPECIALTIES

11:35.500 --> 11:37.133

TUNA FISH CASSEROLE,

12:06.833 --> 12:07.833
WELL, YOU'RE
GOING TO GET A LOT MORE

12:07.867 --> 12:09.167

12:09.200 --> 12:10.933
THANK YOU.

12:21.767 --> 12:23.600

12:23.633 --> 12:25.267
HI. I KNOW TODAY
WAS ROUGH FOR YOU, DARLING.

12:25.300 --> 12:28.700
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE OKAY.

12:28.733 --> 12:30.400
SUSHI?

12:30.433 --> 12:31.967
NO, THANKS.

12:32.067 --> 12:33.767

12:33.800 --> 12:35.067
WELL,
I DON'T BUY IT,

12:35.067 --> 12:38.733
BUT IT'S FINE TO BE CAUTIOUS.

12:38.767 --> 12:40.600
SO HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

12:40.633 --> 12:43.567
I'M OKAY.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.200
I'M TRYING
NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT.

12:45.233 --> 12:46.200
I'M JUST THROWING MYSELF

12:46.233 --> 12:47.267
INTO MY WORK.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.467
YEAH?

12:48.500 --> 12:49.967
WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON THERE?

12:50.067 --> 12:53.667
I AM WRITING A GRANT PROPOSAL
FOR A PROJECT

12:53.700 --> 12:55.833
CALLED THE CAMPAIGN
FOR QUALITY EDUCATION.

12:55.867 --> 12:59.067
IT'S OUR MAIN FOCUS
RIGHT NOW.

12:59.067 --> 13:01.167
WOW. TELL ME A LITTLE ABOUT IT.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.533
WE'RE BRINGING
K THROUGH SIX KIDS

13:02.567 --> 13:04.467
FROM ALL DIFFERENT
SOCIOECONOMIC SITUATIONS

13:04.500 --> 13:05.533
AND PUTTING THEM

13:05.567 --> 13:07.200
INTO A COMMUNITY
OUTREACH PROGRAM

13:07.233 --> 13:10.167
TO TEACH LITERACY
AND CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS.

13:10.200 --> 13:13.267
WOW, WELL,
THAT SOUNDS AMBITIOUS.

13:13.300 --> 13:14.933
YEAH.

13:17.133 --> 13:20.100
YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
TINA?

13:20.133 --> 13:22.167
YOU ARE AN EXCEPTIONAL WOMAN,

13:22.200 --> 13:24.700
AND YOU DESERVE TO BE
FULLY APPRECIATED,

13:24.733 --> 13:27.100
AND THE WAY
BETTE TREATED YOU

13:27.133 --> 13:28.933
WAS BULLSHIT.

13:30.533 --> 13:32.767
GOOD NIGHT.

13:36.233 --> 13:37.333

13:42.133 --> 13:44.600
WELL, THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR,
SWEET CHEEKS.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.533
[SIGHS]

13:54.567 --> 14:01.500
THERE IS NO NEGATIVE
WITHOUT A POSITIVE.

14:01.533 --> 14:07.500
THIS MAN SAYS THAT THE ANIMAL
HE MOST RESEMBLES IS A FERRET.

14:07.533 --> 14:09.300
WHY?

14:09.333 --> 14:13.533
HE THINKS OF HIMSELF
AS A THIEVING RODENT,

14:13.567 --> 14:18.233
BUT, MY FERRET FRIEND,
PICTURE THIS.

14:18.267 --> 14:20.733
PICTURE YOURSELF AS A FERRET.

14:20.767 --> 14:22.700
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

14:22.733 --> 14:24.600
VISUALIZE.

14:24.633 --> 14:28.067
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT FERRETS.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.667
FERRETS ARE STRONG.

14:30.700 --> 14:34.867
THEY CAN CARRY OBJECTS
MORE THAN TWICE THEIR SIZE.

14:34.900 --> 14:40.433
DID YOU KNOW THAT FERRETS
ARE ALSO UNUSUALLY INTELLIGENT?

14:40.467 --> 14:44.900
THEY ARE
PROBLEM-SOLVING ANIMALS.

14:44.933 --> 14:47.167
LOOK AT YOU.

14:47.200 --> 14:50.933
WHAT A MARVELOUS CREATURE
YOU ARE.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.700
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, FRIEND?

14:55.733 --> 14:56.867
[MAN]: GAVIN.

14:56.900 --> 14:58.533
WHAT ANIMAL DO YOU RESEMBLE,
GAVIN?

14:58.567 --> 15:00.200
OH, THAT'S EASY.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.067
AN OSTRICH.

15:02.067 --> 15:07.367
GAVIN THINKS OF HIMSELF
AS COWARDLY,

15:07.400 --> 15:11.100
WITH HIS HEAD IN THE SAND.

15:11.133 --> 15:16.900
GAVIN, DID YOU KNOW
THAT MALE OSTRICHES

15:16.933 --> 15:19.733
ARE FAST AND POWERFUL

15:19.767 --> 15:24.833
AND MAJESTICALLY
SELF-SUFFICIENT?

15:27.767 --> 15:29.500
LADY WITH THE FLASHING EYES.

15:29.533 --> 15:32.133
SO SKITTISH.

15:32.167 --> 15:36.467
I'LL BET I KNOW
WHAT ANIMAL YOU IDENTIFY WITH.

15:39.500 --> 15:43.600
AN ALLEY CAT,
I GUESS.

15:43.633 --> 15:47.567
NOT JUST A CAT,
AN ALLEY CAT.

15:47.600 --> 15:56.067
SYBARITIC, FERAL,
SELF-INDULGENT, IRRESPONSIBLE.

15:56.067 --> 16:00.500
IS THAT YOU, LADY ALLEY CAT?

16:02.833 --> 16:05.133
[***]

16:11.500 --> 16:13.400
THEY'RE HARD
TO SHOOT.

16:13.433 --> 16:14.467
COME ON.

16:14.500 --> 16:15.833
I'M TRYING.

16:15.867 --> 16:16.833
I CAN'T.

16:16.867 --> 16:18.667
GO FOR IT AGAIN.

16:18.700 --> 16:20.467
I CAN'T.

16:20.500 --> 16:21.967
COME ON.

16:22.067 --> 16:22.967
GET HER. GET HER.

16:23.067 --> 16:23.967

16:32.933 --> 16:34.667
I GOT HER!

16:55.600 --> 16:56.567
SHANE.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.067
I'M SORRY.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.733
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO INTERRUPT YOUR FLOW.

17:03.300 --> 17:05.467
I'M SO BROKE.

17:07.400 --> 17:08.800
IF WE DON'T FIND
A THIRD PERSON,

17:08.833 --> 17:10.100
THERE IS NO WAY
I'LL BE ABLE

17:10.133 --> 17:11.733
TO COME UP
WITH HALF THE RENT.

17:11.767 --> 17:12.733

17:12.767 --> 17:13.833

THAT HAPPENED

17:29.067 --> 17:30.367
BETWEEN CARMEN AND ME?

17:30.400 --> 17:32.333
I MEAN,
IF WE WERE TO--

17:32.367 --> 17:33.433
ARE YOU?

17:33.467 --> 17:34.433
I DON'T KNOW.

17:34.467 --> 17:38.067
I MEAN, WE JUST KISSED.

17:38.067 --> 17:40.367
SHE HASN'T CALLED OR ANYTHING.

17:42.433 --> 17:44.700
YOU COULD CALL HER.

17:44.733 --> 17:47.200
I CAN'T DO THAT.

17:47.233 --> 17:50.467
WELL, UH, DO YOU WANT ME
TO INVITE HER OVER?

17:52.533 --> 17:53.567
YOU WOULD DO THAT?

17:55.767 --> 17:59.267
ARE YOU SURE
THAT YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT?

17:59.300 --> 18:01.733
CONSIDER IT DONE.

18:04.067 --> 18:07.200

20:09.233 --> 20:11.433
I'M LEADING
WEEKEND AFTER NEXT.

20:11.467 --> 20:15.200
I DIDN'T SIGN UP
FOR YOUR ADVANCED SEMINAR.

20:15.233 --> 20:16.433
OKAY,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

20:16.467 --> 20:17.933
DON'T SIGN UP FOR IT

20:17.967 --> 20:23.400

20:24.433 --> 20:26.933

20:38.700 --> 20:40.800
WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?

20:40.833 --> 20:42.433
WELL,
ALYSSA HATES HER HAIR,

20:42.467 --> 20:43.633
AND SHE INSULTED JAMIE,

20:43.667 --> 20:46.367
AND JAMIE
STORMED OFF THE SET,

20:46.400 --> 20:47.700
AND NOW ALYSSA IS HAVING
A TOTAL BREAKDOWN.

20:47.733 --> 20:49.233
SHE WON'T LET ANYONE
COME NEAR HER.

20:49.267 --> 20:50.833
WHERE IS GORDO?

20:50.867 --> 20:52.533
HE'S BACK
AT THE PRODUCTION OFFICE.

20:52.567 --> 20:55.000
HE AND ALYSSA
HAD A FIGHT YESTERDAY,

20:55.033 --> 20:57.833
AND SHE BANNED HIM
FROM THE SET.

20:57.867 --> 21:00.100
THE FUCKING ACTRESS
BANNED THE FUCKING PRODUCER

21:00.133 --> 21:01.400
FROM HIS OWN MOVIE SET?

21:01.433 --> 21:02.467
YEAH.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.067
FIND JAMIE.

21:04.067 --> 21:05.167
TELL HIM TO GET
HIS ASS BACK HERE

21:05.200 --> 21:06.700
AND FIX HER HAIR.

21:06.733 --> 21:08.500
I CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE
ANOTHER HALF A DAY.

21:08.533 --> 21:09.667
NOW, VERONICA,

21:09.700 --> 21:10.433
IF YOU HEARD
WHAT SHE SAID TO HIM--

21:10.467 --> 21:11.433
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK

21:11.467 --> 21:13.433
WHAT THAT LITTLE CUNT
SAID TO HIM.

21:13.467 --> 21:14.567
YOU TELL HER
THAT IF SHE'S NOT BACK

21:14.600 --> 21:15.733
ON THAT SET
IN 10 MINUTES

21:15.767 --> 21:16.867
WITH HER HAIR PERFECT,

21:16.900 --> 21:18.600
I WILL FIRE
HER SORRY ASS

21:18.633 --> 21:19.633
AND REPLACE IT

21:19.667 --> 21:21.533
WITH KATE WINSLET'S
SPOTLESS MIND.

21:21.567 --> 21:24.067
JAMIE JUST QUIT.

21:24.100 --> 21:25.767
THAT'S GREAT.

21:25.800 --> 21:26.900
THAT'S FUCKING GREAT.

21:26.933 --> 21:29.800
THIS BITCH IS COSTING ME
$50,000 A MINUTE.

21:29.833 --> 21:31.600
I'LL RIP HER FUCKING HAIR OUT.

21:31.633 --> 21:33.267

WHO CAN DEAL WITH HER.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.233
I DON'T KNOW.

21:46.267 --> 21:48.167
OH, I THINK IT'S
ONE OF THE HAIRDRESSERS

21:48.200 --> 21:51.433

WITH THE DAY PLAYERS.

21:51.467 --> 21:52.500
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL,

21:52.533 --> 21:55.967
AND YOU HARDLY NEED
ANYTHING AT ALL.

21:56.067 --> 21:57.933
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?

21:59.367 --> 22:01.400
IT'S JUST
ONE CRAZY BITCH.

22:01.433 --> 22:03.367
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

YOU'RE WITH?

23:43.733 --> 23:46.333
THE CALIFORNIA ART CENTER.

23:46.367 --> 23:48.433
OUR MUSEUM HAS
A LONG-STANDING RELATIONSHIP

23:48.467 --> 23:49.867
WITH THE PEABODY FOUNDATION.

23:49.900 --> 23:52.667
WE ALWAYS FUNDED THE ARTS
VERY GENEROUSLY.

23:52.700 --> 23:53.767
I'M GLAD YOU BENEFITED.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.067
WE DID, IMMENSELY,

23:56.067 --> 23:57.633
BUT I HOPE YOU'RE NOT SPEAKING
IN THE PAST TENSE.

24:01.900 --> 24:03.800
YOU KNOW, YOUR MOTHER
WAS A GREAT SUPPORTER OF OURS.

24:03.833 --> 24:06.533
SHE HELPED TO FUND
THREE TO FIVE PROJECTS A YEAR.

24:06.567 --> 24:08.167
MY MOTHER'S RETIRED.

24:08.200 --> 24:09.967
I'M AWARE OF THAT.

24:10.067 --> 24:11.500
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE, OBVIOUSLY.

24:11.533 --> 24:14.367
OBVIOUSLY.

YOU'VE RECEIVED OUR PROPOSAL.

24:20.167 --> 24:22.733

TO BE HONEST,

24:24.067 --> 24:26.667
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN AROUND
TO THE ARTS PROJECTS.

24:26.700 --> 24:28.067
YOU HAVEN'T READ IT.

24:28.067 --> 24:30.533
I'VE BEEN FOCUSING
ON THE SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAMS.

24:33.100 --> 24:35.333
LOOK AT THIS,
BETTE.

24:35.367 --> 24:36.733

IN BOSTON,

BECAUSE THEY'RE WORKING SO HARD
TO FEED AND CLOTHE THEM.

24:56.067 --> 24:57.100
TO SUPPORT THE ARTS

AS GENEROUSLY
AS YOUR MOTHER DID.

WITH THAT $35,000.

IS MUCH MORE VITAL

28:37.567 --> 28:39.700
TO YOUR CONTINUED
EMPLOYMENT

28:39.733 --> 28:42.967
THAN THE MORONIC ACTRESS

TO CALM HER DOWN.

28:45.400 --> 28:46.733
I'M SORRY IF IT OFFENDED YOU.

28:46.767 --> 28:48.600

UNPRECEDENTED.

28:59.867 --> 29:02.100
FOR HOLDING UP PRODUCTION
FOR HOURS ON END.

IN FIVE MINUTES.

29:04.467 --> 29:06.400
IT REALLY WASN'T THAT HARD.

29:08.067 --> 29:09.067

MAYBE TWICE,
THREE TIMES A WEEK,

29:30.733 --> 29:32.667
IF I THOUGHT YOUR SPECIAL SKILL

29:32.700 --> 29:33.900
COULD COME IN HANDY.

29:33.933 --> 29:35.533
I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO.
