03:22.436 --> 03:26.296
Chester, we cannot tell the future.

03:26.297 --> 03:28.589
It is written by too many hands.

03:35.886 --> 03:39.030
Mrs. Furuya, you don't have to do this.

03:41.274 --> 03:43.476
I'll have it for you in a week's time.

03:43.477 --> 03:46.244
Then all will be right.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.899
Smile, boy.

04:35.978 --> 04:37.787
Your mother's watching you.

04:42.728 --> 04:44.662
Ma! Pop!

05:06.927 --> 05:08.110
You forgot this.

06:25.825 --> 06:28.348
<font color="#a4290b">♪ The Terror: Infamy 2x01 ♪</font>

07:08.172 --> 07:10.612
Pop, do you want to check the catch?

07:25.951 --> 07:27.742
Shogo...

07:30.477 --> 07:31.800
Fight the fish!

07:31.801 --> 07:33.084
You the master!

07:33.085 --> 07:34.117
Hai.

07:34.118 --> 07:36.498
I was 110 pound

07:36.499 --> 07:40.933
when they name me Tuna-Boxing
Champion of San Pedro.

07:40.934 --> 07:43.342
You boxed against a tuna?

07:43.343 --> 07:46.272
1915.

07:46.273 --> 07:48.764
I just come from San Francisco.

07:48.765 --> 07:52.958
I was tea farmer, never fish before.

07:52.959 --> 07:56.568
But I catch 200-pound bluefin

07:56.569 --> 07:58.585
down by Newport Bay.

07:58.586 --> 08:00.777
I reel it in,

08:00.778 --> 08:03.895
fish sit up on deck like this.

08:03.896 --> 08:05.551
I punch it in the face!

08:05.552 --> 08:07.251
Knock it out.

08:07.252 --> 08:09.827
One punch!

08:09.828 --> 08:13.495
They call me Tuna-Boxing
Champion of San Pedro

08:13.496 --> 08:14.544
after that.

08:16.848 --> 08:19.298
Pop, we fishing for sport now?

08:19.299 --> 08:23.536
Seven for us, four into the ocean.

08:25.794 --> 08:28.295
For luck.

08:28.296 --> 08:30.070
For Mrs. Furuya.

08:30.071 --> 08:33.712
There was bakemono at funeral.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.839
You know bakemono?

08:35.840 --> 08:39.299
What... what kind of
bakemono, Yamato-sa?

08:39.301 --> 08:40.375
The kind you can see,

08:40.376 --> 08:41.971
or did you just feel it?

08:41.972 --> 08:43.320
Come on.

08:43.321 --> 08:46.154
I thought we left that
old-country stuff behind.

08:46.155 --> 08:47.646
Even if those things did exist,

08:47.647 --> 08:49.837
why would they come
all the way over here?

08:49.838 --> 08:51.847
Why not? We did.

08:53.742 --> 08:56.222
Chester. Be useful.

08:57.145 --> 08:59.345
Beautiful catch for you, Mr. Grichuk!

08:59.346 --> 09:01.963
Water is cold today.

09:01.964 --> 09:03.788
Good for mackerel.

09:05.146 --> 09:08.381
Henry-san, you say
everything's good for mackerel.

09:09.202 --> 09:10.675
Oh, yeah.

09:10.676 --> 09:12.652
Jesus.

09:14.365 --> 09:15.873
What is this?

09:17.109 --> 09:20.169
You're gonna give my girls
a heart attack.

09:20.170 --> 09:21.450
Ah...

09:23.691 --> 09:25.732
Too much bycatch.

09:25.733 --> 09:28.174
It'll take ten girls
to sort through this.

09:28.175 --> 09:29.957
Twenty a ton.

09:29.958 --> 09:31.890
Mr. Grichuk, the price is forty.

09:31.891 --> 09:33.151
Twenty.

09:33.152 --> 09:34.500
Some folks say I shouldn't even

09:34.501 --> 09:36.553
be buying from you people.

09:36.554 --> 09:38.297
You know how they talk these days.

09:38.298 --> 09:40.357
Maybe too cold.

09:40.358 --> 09:42.126
Bottom fish come to surface.

09:42.127 --> 09:43.183
Mr. Grichuk,

09:43.184 --> 09:44.723
my father's given this cannery

09:44.724 --> 09:47.096
the best fish in the bay for years.

09:47.097 --> 09:48.403
He deserves forty.

09:48.404 --> 09:52.188
The forty dollars is for
a ton of mackerel, son.

09:52.189 --> 09:54.544
Not mackerel mixed with devil fish

09:54.545 --> 09:56.994
or squid, or anything else.

09:56.995 --> 09:58.955
We'll sort through it all ourselves.

09:59.986 --> 10:01.417
Pull out all the trash fish.

10:01.418 --> 10:02.842
Frankly, it's better eating.

10:04.170 --> 10:06.147
But you'll have your mackerel.

10:06.148 --> 10:07.246
At forty a ton.

10:17.768 --> 10:19.216
You want to be a captain?

10:19.217 --> 10:21.067
Learn to fish.

10:36.955 --> 10:39.247
Henry-san! Chester!

10:45.074 --> 10:46.074
Hey, Chet!

10:47.246 --> 10:48.589
What's buzzin', cousin?

10:48.590 --> 10:50.331
Hell of a jalopy.

10:50.332 --> 10:51.689
Packard.

10:51.690 --> 10:55.023
Only six Japanese on the
island have their own car.

10:55.024 --> 10:57.139
Pop, this is Marlon I
was telling you about.

10:57.140 --> 10:58.681
From the Naval Station?

10:58.682 --> 11:02.842
Oh, you are the hakujin
going to L.A. all the time.

11:02.843 --> 11:03.993
Don't listen to him.

11:03.994 --> 11:06.538
He thinks I'll be on the island forever.

11:06.539 --> 11:08.699
Hey, I got us those
tickets for tomorrow night.

11:10.516 --> 11:12.776
We're taking Walt Yoshida to the movies.

11:12.777 --> 11:14.374
"Down Mexico Way" at the Orpheum.

11:14.375 --> 11:16.113
Gene Autry.

11:16.114 --> 11:17.689
When do they let you off?

11:17.690 --> 11:19.516
Not for another eight hours.

11:19.517 --> 11:21.285
The entire coast is on alert.

11:21.286 --> 11:22.977
Supposed to keep my
eyes peeled for spies,

11:22.978 --> 11:24.886
especially Jap ones.

11:24.887 --> 11:26.312
Hey, Marlon,

11:27.471 --> 11:30.177
keep my son away from
the Naval Station, okay?

11:31.153 --> 11:33.888
They see him, they
don't know who to shoot.

11:50.965 --> 11:53.900
Your heart's beating so fast.

11:57.448 --> 12:00.181
I thought you said you had experience.

12:00.182 --> 12:02.493
It's not that.

12:02.494 --> 12:04.236
It's that your father is down the hall.

12:04.237 --> 12:06.664
Shh.

12:06.665 --> 12:08.138
Don't remind me.

12:08.139 --> 12:09.046
Fine.

12:09.047 --> 12:12.497
Let's not and say we did.

12:12.498 --> 12:13.530
Or...

12:13.531 --> 12:15.147
let's...

12:16.699 --> 12:18.299
and not say anything.

12:19.252 --> 12:21.679
Yeah.

12:21.680 --> 12:23.888
That sounds better.

12:27.376 --> 12:28.376
Hey.

12:30.263 --> 12:31.354
Have you got it?

12:42.442 --> 12:45.467
Take the darker one first, the gaiyo.

12:45.468 --> 12:46.509
On the second day,

12:46.510 --> 12:48.430
add in the lighter one, the toki.

12:49.342 --> 12:51.739
Once the bleeding starts...

12:51.740 --> 12:53.048
you can stop.

12:59.540 --> 13:01.599
It will kill my father if he knew.

13:05.190 --> 13:06.190
And it's killed us.

13:08.918 --> 13:11.577
What are we supposed to do after this?

13:11.578 --> 13:14.137
I haven't thought that far.

13:15.309 --> 13:16.925
All I keep seeing in my head

13:16.926 --> 13:18.666
is Mrs. Furuya,

13:18.667 --> 13:20.313
laying there,

13:20.314 --> 13:22.198
all made up. Pristine.

13:22.199 --> 13:23.389
Stop.

13:23.390 --> 13:24.787
You can't blame yourself for that.

13:24.788 --> 13:26.655
She killed herself
after we asked for this.

13:26.656 --> 13:27.823
If she thought it was wrong,

13:27.824 --> 13:29.772
- she wouldn't have made this for you.
- She didn't want to do it,

13:29.773 --> 13:31.705
but she did it anyway because it was me.

13:33.416 --> 13:35.866
She tried to help us with
this terrible thing we did,

13:35.867 --> 13:37.175
and now...

13:46.563 --> 13:47.913
So...

13:50.734 --> 13:51.934
What do we do next?

13:54.696 --> 13:56.548
After it's over,

13:56.549 --> 13:59.407
tell your father you're okay.

13:59.408 --> 14:00.848
Food poisoning.

14:00.849 --> 14:03.207
No need to see a doctor.

14:03.208 --> 14:05.157
Then, by Christmas...

14:05.158 --> 14:07.107
we can forget.

14:07.108 --> 14:08.334
All of it.

14:08.335 --> 14:11.396
You go to nursing school...

14:11.397 --> 14:13.662
I go see the country...

14:13.663 --> 14:15.472
Nothing to get in the way.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.057
You know...

14:22.074 --> 14:24.411
my father always wanted me to be a nun.

14:26.746 --> 14:29.720
Maybe as a penance for my mother.

14:29.721 --> 14:31.780
I was gonna do it, too.

14:34.587 --> 14:36.128
Sister Illuminata.

14:37.423 --> 14:39.188
Then one day I realized

14:39.189 --> 14:42.082
that it was all because
I liked the sound of it.

14:44.955 --> 14:47.055
Not the thing itself.

14:50.010 --> 14:52.034
Anyway, I just...

14:52.035 --> 14:53.295
always meant to tell you that.

14:53.296 --> 14:54.521
Just never got around to it.

14:56.967 --> 14:58.276
I wish I could've gotten to take you out

14:58.277 --> 15:00.459
in my pop's Packard.

15:00.460 --> 15:04.244
It's jet black... so pretty.

15:04.245 --> 15:05.474
All he does is take it in circles

15:05.475 --> 15:07.058
around that tiny island.

15:09.312 --> 15:12.331
They come from one island
to an even smaller island.

15:14.034 --> 15:15.959
That's their entire world.

15:18.780 --> 15:20.005
I can't do that.

15:27.973 --> 15:29.890
Thanks for this.

15:35.389 --> 15:37.064
You should probably go first.

16:03.033 --> 16:04.977
If quality of the catch

16:04.978 --> 16:06.677
is deteriorating,

16:06.678 --> 16:08.127
you've got to adapt.

16:08.128 --> 16:09.330
Sorry, Mr. Grichuk,

16:09.331 --> 16:11.155
but the quality is the same.

16:11.156 --> 16:13.694
You say that, but look.

16:14.854 --> 16:19.033
These splitters are for
eight-to 10-ounce mackerel.

16:19.854 --> 16:21.645
Guppies like yours, though,

16:21.646 --> 16:23.844
my girls have to split them by hand.

16:23.845 --> 16:27.379
Now, you've got to understand,
I can't pay you 40 for that.

16:27.380 --> 16:29.672
Okay. How much?

16:29.673 --> 16:31.941
I don't know...

16:31.942 --> 16:34.838
20? 15?

16:34.839 --> 16:36.315
What do you think it's worth?

16:36.316 --> 16:38.709
Aw, shit.

16:47.869 --> 16:50.161
Jesus Christ! Help!

16:50.162 --> 16:51.330
Help!

16:51.331 --> 16:53.057
Help me!

16:53.058 --> 16:55.157
Help! Help!

17:54.477 --> 17:56.662
Chester! Supper!

18:07.967 --> 18:08.967
Oh...

18:10.836 --> 18:12.619
We're not waiting for Walt?

18:12.620 --> 18:14.537
He's home... preparing.

18:14.538 --> 18:16.665
Betty's sailing back from Tokyo.

18:16.666 --> 18:18.636
Walt hasn't seen her in a year.

18:18.637 --> 18:20.669
She still has one semester,

18:20.670 --> 18:22.619
but better to leave while you can.

18:22.620 --> 18:24.432
Wedding will be in March...

18:25.392 --> 18:27.317
And soon, a grandson.

18:39.072 --> 18:41.190
They didn't tell you I'm
moving to the mainland?

18:41.191 --> 18:43.940
All the magazines are looking
for photographers out west.

18:43.941 --> 18:45.245
We'll see.

18:45.246 --> 18:46.696
What?

18:46.697 --> 18:48.857
Should I be hauling
fish the rest of my life?

18:49.842 --> 18:52.191
Chester, it's safe here.

18:52.192 --> 18:53.576
It's good life.

18:55.038 --> 18:57.515
There's war all over the world.

18:57.516 --> 18:59.031
So many people dying.

18:59.032 --> 19:01.606
I remember 23 years ago,

19:01.607 --> 19:04.487
I sail three weeks with
nothing but photo of this man.

19:06.049 --> 19:08.309
I so relief he look like his picture.

19:13.774 --> 19:15.124
Life is hard, Chester.

19:16.035 --> 19:17.915
You cannot do it without family.

19:21.397 --> 19:22.997
Just ask Mrs. Furuya.

19:36.246 --> 19:37.537
I'm so sorry about that.

19:37.538 --> 19:40.082
Actually, I'm kind of glad.

19:40.083 --> 19:42.439
I've been going with a
hakujin from the Naval Station,

19:42.947 --> 19:46.255
so I'm taking this as a
sign my folks don't know.

19:46.256 --> 19:47.920
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

19:47.921 --> 19:49.975
Yeah, it's probably best they don't.

19:49.976 --> 19:52.209
They'd die, or I would.

19:52.210 --> 19:54.049
- You haven't told Walt, have you?
- Mm-mm.

19:54.050 --> 19:55.605
My brother's as Japanese as rice.

19:55.606 --> 19:57.540
I don't think he could even imagine it.

20:01.080 --> 20:02.654
You know what's truly scary?

20:04.399 --> 20:07.608
That Hideo Furuya would get blind drunk,

20:07.609 --> 20:08.777
beat his wife,

20:08.778 --> 20:10.778
then wake with no memory,

20:10.779 --> 20:13.739
see the bruises, and
then beat her again,

20:14.614 --> 20:16.634
thinking she was stepping out on him.

20:19.932 --> 20:21.656
That's a monster.

20:25.461 --> 20:26.938
Here. Is this it?

20:26.939 --> 20:29.580
Where Mrs. Furuya did it?

20:29.581 --> 20:32.073
The police trampled all over it,

20:32.074 --> 20:33.468
but give it a week,

20:33.469 --> 20:35.137
and it'll look like it never happened.

20:35.138 --> 20:37.280
Do you have any idea why?

20:41.787 --> 20:43.036
I, um...

20:44.314 --> 20:46.221
I hadn't seen her in a while.

20:46.222 --> 20:47.222
Who knows?

20:49.138 --> 20:52.455
Jeez, of all the ways...

20:52.456 --> 20:53.655
Maybe she wanted us

20:53.656 --> 20:57.134
to remember her... intact.

21:31.837 --> 21:33.714
Sorry for the lateness of the hour.

21:34.221 --> 21:36.146
You want coffee, Mr. Grichuk?

21:36.828 --> 21:38.918
You don't look so good.

21:38.919 --> 21:40.724
This won't take long.

21:41.922 --> 21:44.058
I wanted you to be the first to know.

21:45.425 --> 21:46.500
They canned me.

21:46.501 --> 21:48.784
That's ironic.

21:48.785 --> 21:51.047
What? Why?

21:51.048 --> 21:53.789
Their machine craps out.

21:53.790 --> 21:55.781
Someone's got to take the blame.

21:55.782 --> 21:58.315
Oh, you're a good man.

21:58.316 --> 22:02.243
Thirteen years I gave
those sons of bitches.

22:02.244 --> 22:03.892
And now what?

22:03.893 --> 22:06.036
What do I got?

22:07.310 --> 22:09.012
You have your health...

22:09.013 --> 22:10.079
your life.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.970
I got my life...

22:13.286 --> 22:15.163
but no livelihood.

22:16.864 --> 22:20.409
That puts me in a tough spot, Nakayama.

22:22.128 --> 22:25.234
If only you'd brought
me some decent-size fish.

22:26.667 --> 22:28.332
It was an accident.

22:28.913 --> 22:29.969
Nobody's fault.

22:29.970 --> 22:32.920
I always treated you square.

22:32.921 --> 22:34.723
You're a little short on your catch,

22:34.724 --> 22:36.931
I cut you some slack,

22:37.687 --> 22:40.563
and now you walk me
into this pile of shit.

22:46.227 --> 22:47.856
I need reparation.

22:48.813 --> 22:52.681
Mr. Grichuk, you're the boss.

22:52.682 --> 22:54.228
I'm just a fisherman.

22:54.229 --> 22:56.078
I have nothing to give.

22:59.073 --> 23:01.064
You remember last year

23:01.065 --> 23:03.999
when the antispying
laws went on the books?

23:05.764 --> 23:07.863
You and all the other Jap fishermen

23:07.864 --> 23:10.717
had to register your boats.

23:10.718 --> 23:12.343
Formality...

23:16.466 --> 23:17.589
but you never did.

23:17.590 --> 23:20.374
I was fishing, for you...

23:21.199 --> 23:22.287
in Mexico.

23:22.288 --> 23:24.090
What if all those extra gas tanks

23:24.091 --> 23:25.542
are for the emperor's submarines?

23:25.543 --> 23:27.232
I'm not a spy.

23:27.233 --> 23:28.503
I mean, it's only natural

23:28.504 --> 23:30.513
to want to help your own kind,

23:30.514 --> 23:32.220
but still...

23:32.221 --> 23:35.302
"If you question it, report it."

23:35.303 --> 23:38.204
You know I love this country.

23:38.205 --> 23:39.704
I'm not a spy.

23:42.509 --> 23:43.725
Probably not...

23:45.786 --> 23:47.804
but don't make me the kind of asshole

23:47.805 --> 23:49.638
who reports these things.

23:54.002 --> 23:56.145
What do you have in mind?

24:01.560 --> 24:05.646
Hey, I never got to say...

24:06.848 --> 24:09.632
Thank you for saving my life today.

24:09.633 --> 24:12.360
I really do appreciate it.

24:42.513 --> 24:44.818
You knew I was with Amy.
Why didn't you wait for me?

24:44.819 --> 24:46.862
Stop saying that.

24:52.277 --> 24:55.205
People don't think that way anymore.

24:55.206 --> 24:57.397
We can do something.

24:57.398 --> 24:58.783
You can't let Grichuk push you around.

24:58.784 --> 25:00.710
That's your car.

25:00.711 --> 25:02.735
You own it.

25:02.736 --> 25:04.136
Be a man.

25:09.369 --> 25:10.649
In Japan...

25:13.132 --> 25:15.828
my father don't even have his own ox.

25:17.136 --> 25:19.228
I pull cart myself.

25:21.617 --> 25:25.843
I come here, all I
ever want is automobile,

25:25.844 --> 25:27.964
a cart to pull me.

25:30.732 --> 25:33.858
It took 20 years, but I got it.

25:36.414 --> 25:38.280
So what if they take my car?

25:40.159 --> 25:41.651
I'm still the same man,

25:43.361 --> 25:45.735
a man who earned his Packard.

25:47.484 --> 25:50.240
Don't you tell me how to be a man...

25:51.888 --> 25:53.438
... boy.

26:25.711 --> 26:27.386
Has your son eaten yet?

27:02.315 --> 27:03.615
What are you doing?

27:07.004 --> 27:08.361
Purification.

27:08.362 --> 27:09.449
Cleaning the house.

27:09.450 --> 27:10.823
Nothing's haunting the house.

27:10.824 --> 27:12.241
The old spirits are here, Furuya-san.

27:12.242 --> 27:14.867
I didn't need protection before,

27:14.868 --> 27:16.475
and I don't need it now.

27:16.476 --> 27:17.867
Get out!

27:34.848 --> 27:36.022
Next Christmas...

27:37.309 --> 27:39.107
you'll have a Cadillac.

27:41.021 --> 27:43.288
If we make it that far.

27:52.973 --> 27:54.105
Furuya-san...

27:55.319 --> 27:57.679
apologies for Asako bothering you.

27:58.466 --> 28:00.476
You know how wives are.

28:02.301 --> 28:04.351
At least you have one.

28:11.810 --> 28:13.318
I've got to take a leak.

29:22.996 --> 29:25.556
Furuya-san! Furuya-san!

29:47.906 --> 29:49.596
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

29:49.597 --> 29:51.630
Is it Gene Autry or Roy Rogers?

29:51.631 --> 29:52.660
Autry.

29:52.661 --> 29:54.578
Autry.

29:54.579 --> 29:56.580
"Down Mexico Way" is
what we saw tonight.

29:56.581 --> 29:58.024
Has anybody seen it?

29:58.025 --> 30:01.033
You know, in case our
folks ask how the movie was.

30:01.034 --> 30:02.795
Gene and Smiley sing a few songs,

30:02.796 --> 30:03.921
track down the bad guys,

30:03.922 --> 30:05.589
and it all ends with a fiesta...

30:05.590 --> 30:06.694
I assume.

30:06.695 --> 30:08.292
Wait, wait, wait. Speaking of old folks,

30:08.293 --> 30:10.909
a drink... to old man Furuya.

30:10.910 --> 30:13.395
- Poor bastard may never see again.
- Furuya.

30:13.396 --> 30:15.266
Evil spirit strikes again.

30:15.267 --> 30:17.843
Spirit or not, if anyone
deserved it, it's that S.O.B.

30:17.844 --> 30:20.553
He went blind the same
week his wife died.

30:20.554 --> 30:21.661
That doesn't spook you?

30:21.662 --> 30:22.787
Oh, come on, Chet.

30:22.788 --> 30:24.557
Lighten up.

30:24.558 --> 30:26.582
It's Walt's sayonara.

30:26.583 --> 30:28.010
Last chance to get a piece, Walt.

30:28.011 --> 30:29.451
Last chance?

30:29.452 --> 30:30.883
First chance!

30:30.884 --> 30:32.926
Shh, she's coming.

30:34.953 --> 30:36.377
I got you guys a white man discount,

30:36.378 --> 30:37.686
so don't embarrass me.

30:40.581 --> 30:43.579
- Ensign Harris.
- Miss Antoinette.

30:43.580 --> 30:45.819
Boys, meet the boss.

30:45.820 --> 30:47.519
She'll take care of us.

30:47.520 --> 30:49.372
I got my best girls for you tonight.

30:50.153 --> 30:52.628
Ladies, gentlemen calling.

30:55.217 --> 30:56.418
Wow.

30:56.419 --> 30:58.727
Which one of you is the groom?

30:59.337 --> 31:01.474
- That would be Walt.
- Lucky you.

31:01.475 --> 31:02.554
You get first pickings.

31:02.555 --> 31:03.929
Go on up.

31:03.930 --> 31:06.317
Come on. Let's go.

31:06.318 --> 31:07.485
Last chance, man.

31:08.602 --> 31:11.512
Everyone, all negotiations in the room.

31:13.368 --> 31:14.399
Aw, come on.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.252
You sure?

31:16.253 --> 31:18.028
Hey, someone needs to pay for Walt.

31:18.029 --> 31:20.946
Loverboy's got a steady girl.

31:20.947 --> 31:23.972
♪ Mexicali rose ♪

31:23.973 --> 31:26.240
♪ Stop crying... ♪

32:24.927 --> 32:26.610
You... Japanese?

38:22.995 --> 38:24.817
Goddamn nip.

38:35.600 --> 38:37.692
Luz! It's me!

38:45.610 --> 38:47.493
Chester, what...

38:50.605 --> 38:51.639
Did you take it?

38:51.640 --> 38:52.744
Chester, you're loaded.

38:52.745 --> 38:53.811
It doesn't matter.

38:53.812 --> 38:55.485
The gaiyo, the toki...

38:55.486 --> 38:56.879
did you take it?

38:56.880 --> 38:58.570
It's not your concern anymore.

38:58.571 --> 39:00.621
Please just tell me if you took it.

39:01.764 --> 39:02.878
No.

39:03.914 --> 39:05.244
Not yet.

39:05.245 --> 39:07.061
Oh, thank God.

39:07.062 --> 39:08.219
Why?

39:08.220 --> 39:09.520
I won't stay long.

39:14.305 --> 39:16.496
I realized something tonight.

39:16.497 --> 39:18.205
Everything that's happened...

39:18.206 --> 39:21.231
on my island, with you and me...

39:21.232 --> 39:22.232
it's a sign.

39:23.409 --> 39:24.440
Like an omen?

39:24.441 --> 39:27.445
I don't know, but I've got the car.

39:27.446 --> 39:28.475
Let's just go.

39:28.476 --> 39:29.566
Go where?

39:29.567 --> 39:31.951
Wherever you want...
wherever sounds good.

39:33.058 --> 39:34.637
Our own acre...

39:36.566 --> 39:40.684
just you, and me, and the baby.

39:40.685 --> 39:42.735
How well do you know me?

39:44.286 --> 39:45.555
Enough to run off?

39:47.119 --> 39:48.601
Enough to raise a baby?

39:50.365 --> 39:52.589
There's no future if
we stay in California,

39:52.590 --> 39:53.950
unless the law changes.

39:53.951 --> 39:55.779
Forget marriage.

39:56.702 --> 39:57.993
How much money have we got?

39:59.128 --> 40:01.403
Who do we know?

40:01.404 --> 40:03.929
How are we going to find work?

40:03.930 --> 40:06.421
What if we get stopped
crossing state lines?

40:06.422 --> 40:07.947
We'll figure it out.

40:07.948 --> 40:09.998
Chester...

40:15.257 --> 40:17.423
In the morning, you'll see we can't.

40:21.982 --> 40:24.581
There's no future for us...

40:24.582 --> 40:26.891
anywhere.

40:32.923 --> 40:35.132
Okay.

40:35.133 --> 40:37.351
Yeah, maybe you're right.

40:58.541 --> 40:59.898
Are you going to take it?

40:59.899 --> 41:02.516
The herbs?

41:02.517 --> 41:04.730
I don't know...

41:05.863 --> 41:08.155
because I'm scared.

41:10.720 --> 41:12.812
Just let me be scared.

43:02.424 --> 43:04.173
What the...

43:14.343 --> 43:15.343
Aah!

43:19.471 --> 43:20.570
Pop!

43:25.137 --> 43:26.688
Pop, why didn't you tell me

43:26.689 --> 43:27.764
you were going out?

43:27.765 --> 43:29.881
Why not tell me where you been?

43:29.882 --> 43:32.255
Someone knock over a
kerosene can last night.

43:32.256 --> 43:33.844
- It's a mess.
- Henry-kun,

43:35.311 --> 43:37.690
somebody messing with your net-to.

43:43.039 --> 43:45.632
Hand, please... it's stuck.

44:05.061 --> 44:06.292
I trust Marlon.

44:06.293 --> 44:07.398
Shore patrol knows.

44:07.399 --> 44:08.423
We didn't do nothing.

44:08.424 --> 44:09.806
We've got nothing to fret over.

44:09.807 --> 44:11.437
There's something evil.

44:12.643 --> 44:13.874
I can feel it.

44:15.663 --> 44:18.234
But why would a spirit go after Grichuk?

44:19.244 --> 44:20.334
He's not Japanese.

44:20.335 --> 44:22.433
But we are.

44:22.434 --> 44:23.966
It brought Grichuk to us.

44:23.967 --> 44:25.259
Now look.

44:27.199 --> 44:29.176
We tell them what a drunk he was.

44:29.177 --> 44:31.276
He fell off the dock... accident.

44:31.277 --> 44:33.644
No accident.

44:33.645 --> 44:36.119
We deserve it.

44:36.120 --> 44:37.926
We come all the way over the ocean,

44:37.927 --> 44:39.576
but we are not safe.

44:39.577 --> 44:41.276
Furuya beat his wife.

44:41.277 --> 44:42.794
He pay for it.

44:48.345 --> 44:50.298
My own son bring shame...

44:52.034 --> 44:53.108
I pay for it.

44:57.958 --> 45:00.383
Gaiyo, toki ..

45:02.113 --> 45:03.901
I went to see Hudlia.

45:03.902 --> 45:05.213
She told me what you did.

45:05.214 --> 45:07.020
Pop, now's not the time.

45:07.021 --> 45:08.021
Who is she?

45:11.234 --> 45:12.234
Who is she?

45:14.463 --> 45:17.155
I was going to tell you...

45:17.156 --> 45:18.438
a girl from college.

45:18.439 --> 45:19.956
It was a mistake.

45:22.212 --> 45:23.443
Mistake.

45:25.308 --> 45:30.427
Mistake was mine, to
let my son go to L.A.

45:30.428 --> 45:31.994
Too weak to resist.

45:31.995 --> 45:33.409
Weak?

45:34.830 --> 45:37.673
I'm making my own way, Pop.

45:39.581 --> 45:41.028
How about you?

45:41.940 --> 45:43.089
What do you call

45:43.090 --> 45:44.492
spending half of your
life in this country

45:44.493 --> 45:46.413
and never leaving your tiny island?

45:47.474 --> 45:49.906
Shuffling around,

45:49.907 --> 45:52.427
begging for scraps from a lousy drunk?

45:53.836 --> 45:56.409
That's the kind of thing that
makes them look down on us.

45:58.099 --> 46:00.139
That's the kind of man I'll never be...

46:04.588 --> 46:06.089
because you know what they call that?

46:07.942 --> 46:09.342
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

46:09.343 --> 46:10.818
Let's move it!

46:16.850 --> 46:18.633
Marlon! Marlon...

46:18.634 --> 46:21.083
what's going on?

46:21.084 --> 46:22.116
Go.

46:22.117 --> 46:24.429
Get the hell out of here. Now.

46:25.818 --> 46:27.225
Come on, let's go.

46:27.226 --> 46:29.327
Come on, let's go!

46:48.799 --> 46:49.891
This morning

46:49.892 --> 46:52.583
at approximately 7:48 Honolulu time,

46:52.584 --> 46:54.512
300 to 400 bombers swooped down

46:54.513 --> 46:57.157
on the naval installation
at Pearl Harbor,

46:57.158 --> 46:58.474
releasing their charges

46:58.475 --> 47:01.017
and causing widespread damage and death.

47:01.018 --> 47:04.802
The totality of such is
still unknown at this point.

47:04.803 --> 47:07.202
Similarly, the exact action
point of these bombers

47:07.203 --> 47:09.111
is still unknown,

47:09.112 --> 47:10.601
but what is irrefutable

47:10.602 --> 47:13.322
is that these bombers
are of Japanese origin,

47:13.323 --> 47:14.893

no attempt to resolve issues
through diplomatic channels...

Chester! Chester! Over here!

Hey!

FBI. It's okay.

48:53.012 --> 48:54.116
Keep moving.

Fight for your country.
